00:27.125 --> 00:29.260
Copy, we have a visual.

00:29.294 --> 00:31.931
This guy is flying, the
MW Unit Six in sight.

00:31.963 --> 00:33.865
Where's my roadblock?

00:41.472 --> 00:44.310
He's
not fucking stopping.

00:44.343 --> 00:48.681
If you
have to apprehend suspect.

00:56.188 --> 00:59.024
Driver, take
the keys out of the ignition

00:59.057 --> 01:02.460
and put both of your hands
out the driver's side window.

01:07.365 --> 01:10.168
Slowly exit the vehicle.

01:20.912 --> 01:24.416
- Drop the weapon!
- Okay, I'm putting it down,

01:24.448 --> 01:29.454
don't shoot me.

01:31.456 --> 01:35.728
Clear,
clear, anyone else in the car?

01:35.760 --> 01:36.595
Just me.

01:41.900 --> 01:43.102
What's in your trunk?

01:43.135 --> 01:46.204
- Don't let it out!
- Don't fucking move.

01:47.673 --> 01:50.843
Oh shit, there's
someone back there.

01:50.876 --> 01:51.910
You don't
know what you've done.

01:51.942 --> 01:53.344
Shut up.

01:53.378 --> 01:55.313
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

01:55.346 --> 01:56.881
She said something.

01:56.915 --> 01:58.417
I've been
standing here the whole time,

01:58.450 --> 02:01.587
- I haven't heard anything.
- Get her away from me.

02:01.620 --> 02:05.257
Hey man,
take it easy, what's wrong?

02:05.290 --> 02:06.358
Please God, no!

03:33.778 --> 03:35.213
Dispatch,
Ambulance Six.

03:35.247 --> 03:38.350
I'm here at the scene, all
these people were left behind.

03:38.383 --> 03:43.055
10
four, help is on the way.

03:57.568 --> 04:00.205
Why in God's name did you
kill those four officers?

04:01.705 --> 04:03.408
I already told
you it wasn't me.

04:04.575 --> 04:05.777
The only thing
I can't figure out

04:05.811 --> 04:07.346
is how you managed
to pull it off.

04:09.181 --> 04:12.417
Your vehicles have cameras,
take a look at the footage.

04:12.449 --> 04:13.351
Your officer did it.

04:21.959 --> 04:23.094
Why would he do that?

04:25.197 --> 04:27.132
It's the woman, she's
not what you think.

04:27.165 --> 04:29.335
You mean the one you
locked in the trunk?

04:34.139 --> 04:35.708
What were you gonna do to her?

05:01.699 --> 05:03.034
So, what's in the bag?

05:04.836 --> 05:06.172
The beginning of the end.

05:23.922 --> 05:24.757
That's it?

05:26.124 --> 05:28.794
- What are these for?
- You'd never believe me.

05:28.826 --> 05:29.661
I wouldn't have.

05:32.062 --> 05:34.567
- Try me.
- I've said enough.

05:51.249 --> 05:54.853
I want everything you can
find out that guy, ASAP.

05:54.886 --> 05:58.557
I'm on it.

06:11.903 --> 06:13.705
Die Apokalypse naht.

06:31.990 --> 06:34.526
Do you wanna say anything
else before we proceed?

06:36.795 --> 06:38.230
Rette uns alle.

06:43.701 --> 06:44.637
Have it your way.

07:06.057 --> 07:10.095
So, what is this
story with this place?

07:12.764 --> 07:17.735
Built in the late 1800s,
sits on 360 acres of land.

07:19.903 --> 07:22.608
There's over 100 buildings
on this property.

07:24.242 --> 07:26.444
It was designed to be
a self-contained town.

07:28.646 --> 07:29.715
That's pretty cool.

07:32.384 --> 07:34.520
It was a state run
psychiatric hospital.

07:36.387 --> 07:38.489
They closed the doors
nearly 30 years ago.

07:39.624 --> 07:41.560
Like asylums all
around the country,

07:41.593 --> 07:45.697
invasive techniques like
prefrontal lobotomies

07:45.730 --> 07:47.132
and electric shock therapy,

07:49.100 --> 07:50.235
they performed it here.

07:51.769 --> 07:54.205
People were
abused on this land.

07:55.572 --> 07:57.942
Then why do you wanna shoot
at this location then?

07:59.978 --> 08:01.747
I've shot here
many times before.

08:04.482 --> 08:06.952
It always makes for a
very interesting backdrop.

08:08.620 --> 08:11.557
I agree.

08:13.223 --> 08:16.961
- Anything to worry about?
- Besides the caving ceilings

08:16.995 --> 08:19.331
and probably peeling lead paint,

08:19.363 --> 08:21.566
I don't see how it
could really hurt us.

08:26.271 --> 08:29.074
Are you sure that
it's a good idea then?

08:31.442 --> 08:34.413
Billy, I think we're gonna get

08:34.446 --> 08:36.148
some really great stuff here.

08:37.749 --> 08:39.851
As long as we would
watch our step inside,

08:41.219 --> 08:42.921
there should be no problems.

08:42.953 --> 08:47.959
My friend told me that
this place is haunted.

08:52.397 --> 08:56.201
Supposedly some urban
explorers reported activity

08:56.234 --> 08:57.603
of some devil worshipers.

09:00.038 --> 09:02.140
But what abandoned place hasn't?

09:06.110 --> 09:08.145
And like I said on the phone,

09:08.178 --> 09:10.149
I'm paying double
my normal rate.

09:13.650 --> 09:18.656
My agent says I need more
location shots in my portfolio.

09:21.091 --> 09:26.097
And plus, I've been fascinated
by places like this.

09:26.965 --> 09:27.833
Yeah, I'll give it a shot.

09:30.499 --> 09:34.505
Cool, listen, bats, rats,
and all sorts of insects

09:39.210 --> 09:40.612
probably call this place home,

09:40.644 --> 09:43.481
but none of them are
gonna pose a threat to us.

09:46.116 --> 09:48.786
And the area that we're
going to is so remote

09:48.820 --> 09:50.422
that no one's gonna bother us.

09:52.789 --> 09:54.458
Hey, how are we
going to be here?

09:54.491 --> 09:55.493
A couple of hours.

09:57.095 --> 10:00.165
It wouldn't be a good idea
to be here after dark.

10:00.197 --> 10:01.232
Oh, why not?

10:03.301 --> 10:04.336
There's no light.

10:06.703 --> 10:08.439
And it would be very
dangerous getting around

10:08.472 --> 10:09.841
when the sun goes down.

10:40.772 --> 10:41.740
Is everything okay?

10:44.408 --> 10:46.711
Yeah, I think so.

10:57.187 --> 10:58.590
Hey, hold on.

11:02.894 --> 11:07.164
Mask, flashlight, come on.

12:02.586 --> 12:07.558
Watch your head.

12:30.682 --> 12:33.552
You don't need your
mask yet, come on.

12:57.207 --> 12:59.843
I guess we're not the
only ones here today.

12:59.876 --> 13:01.112
Does that concern you?

13:02.346 --> 13:04.682
No, this place gets
all sorts of visitors.

13:06.250 --> 13:07.418
Let's go.

13:27.971 --> 13:31.408
Well, let's shoot in
here, I love to light.

13:31.442 --> 13:34.513
Okay, so where would
you want me to be?

13:37.815 --> 13:40.819
First, take that.

13:42.220 --> 13:45.257
Put your stuff down on
it and go over there,

13:47.491 --> 13:50.094
- let's shoot over there.
- Of course.

13:50.128 --> 13:51.129
All right.

13:54.532 --> 13:57.701
- Are you excited?
- Oh, yeah.

13:57.735 --> 14:00.004
Good, yeah,

14:00.037 --> 14:01.873
it's gonna be awesome.

15:05.168 --> 15:07.504
Let's switch rooms.

15:07.538 --> 15:08.706
How about a different outfit?

15:08.739 --> 15:10.208
Okay, I have a
pretty white dress.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.210
It's right behind
you, please bring it.

15:35.198 --> 15:36.668
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

15:36.701 --> 15:40.404
Please help me out
of this, the bottom.

15:41.404 --> 15:42.473
- Thank you.
- Good, okay.

16:00.758 --> 16:02.627
- Steve, turn around.
- What's wrong?

16:02.659 --> 16:07.164
- I just saw someone.
- Who?

16:08.365 --> 16:10.501
I don't know, someone
dressed in dark clothes.

16:16.240 --> 16:17.575
I don't see anybody.

16:17.607 --> 16:19.477
He went
around that corner.

16:21.245 --> 16:23.780
Steve, be careful.

16:23.813 --> 16:27.451
Hello, can I help you?

16:31.621 --> 16:32.423
Steve?

16:38.461 --> 16:39.730
Are you okay?

16:42.365 --> 16:45.437
Steve?

16:48.072 --> 16:49.274
Oh my God.

16:49.307 --> 16:53.879
Get out of here,
run, run!

17:02.519 --> 17:03.554
Get off me.

18:17.662 --> 18:19.396
911,
what's your emergency?

18:19.430 --> 18:23.567
My name is Billy, Billie
Winters, we need help.

18:23.601 --> 18:26.104
We are at the old psychiatric
hospital off North Zero.

18:26.136 --> 18:28.172
What's the problem?

18:28.204 --> 18:29.807
There are people here
who killed my friend.

18:29.839 --> 18:32.209
And they're now
trying to attack me.

18:32.242 --> 18:33.344
I need you

18:33.376 --> 18:35.278
to please remain calm.

18:35.311 --> 18:36.580
Can you please tell me
what building you're in?

18:36.614 --> 18:40.085
Hello?

18:41.919 --> 18:43.254
Are you still there, Ma'am?

18:45.722 --> 18:46.890
Ma'am, hello?

18:51.862 --> 18:54.365
Okay, we're dispatching
officers to the scene.

18:54.397 --> 18:56.701
Please, try and find
a safe place to hide.

19:02.472 --> 19:07.479
No, no, no,
no, get away.

19:19.856 --> 19:21.091
That was quite a show.

19:22.926 --> 19:25.295
I'm a little
disappointed though.

19:25.328 --> 19:28.265
I was expecting more than
just a pirated B-movie.

19:28.298 --> 19:31.201
It's real.

19:32.702 --> 19:34.605
It looks like it's
gonna be a long night.

19:50.554 --> 19:52.090
- What's wrong?
- The engine just died.

19:52.123 --> 19:53.725
We've gotta get this
woman to the hospital.

19:53.758 --> 19:54.925
Now the radio's not working.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.527
How far are we from
any kind of help?

19:56.559 --> 19:58.895
- Probably a good 10 miles.
- We can't just sit here

19:58.929 --> 20:00.965
and let her die, I'm
calling for help.

20:04.067 --> 20:05.302
You feel it, don't you?

20:06.537 --> 20:08.338
Yeah, you're
giving me a headache.

20:09.472 --> 20:11.308
Trust me, you don't
wanna watch those.

20:11.342 --> 20:14.546
Give me a break.

20:31.228 --> 20:33.163
By "The Seraphinian
Necronomicon",

20:33.196 --> 20:36.199
I say these words so
that you will rise again.

20:36.232 --> 20:38.702
I say these words so that,
Satan, you will live through me.

20:38.736 --> 20:39.871
Don't
say these words, Ritchie!

20:47.778 --> 20:52.750
- What the fuck?
- Say you love Satan.

20:59.022 --> 21:01.158
Long Island
officials point to new evidence

21:01.192 --> 21:03.227
of the drug related
murder of a teenage boy

21:03.259 --> 21:05.930
who allegedly was a
member of a satanic cult.

21:05.962 --> 21:08.266
His eyes were removed
in what police described

21:08.298 --> 21:09.800
as a ritualistic killing.

21:15.471 --> 21:17.674
Hello again, this
is Mike Campbell

21:17.708 --> 21:19.610
with the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog,

21:19.643 --> 21:22.446
the blog dedicated to
the search for truth

21:22.479 --> 21:25.082
within the realms of the
paranormal, supernatural

21:25.115 --> 21:26.651
and the unexplained phenomenon.

21:33.390 --> 21:35.359
Today, I will tell you
about the true story

21:35.392 --> 21:37.929
I actually forgot even happened.

21:37.961 --> 21:41.531
It's been the cause of my
nightmares for the past 30 years.

21:41.565 --> 21:44.335
It's laid buried deep
within my psyche.

21:44.367 --> 21:48.205
But I have an obligation to
tell the world the truth,

21:48.239 --> 21:49.774
because it came back.

21:51.375 --> 21:54.578
I found the book, the book
I thought we destroyed,

21:55.712 --> 21:59.082
the book that summonses
the Devil himself.

22:00.284 --> 22:02.286
Mom, what are you doing?

22:02.318 --> 22:03.721
I'm filming my blog here!

22:03.753 --> 22:07.224
I'm vacuuming, I'm
vacuuming, I'm sorry.

22:13.663 --> 22:17.234
I'm totally serious
folks, I really found it,

22:17.268 --> 22:22.273
"The Book of the Dead", "The
Seraphinian Necronomicon".

22:23.740 --> 22:27.077
Never utter these words lest
ye summon the Devil himself.

22:30.381 --> 22:35.386
I have all the footage,
everything, I'm gonna play it now.

22:36.787 --> 22:38.189
If you're faint of heart,
please turn this off.

22:40.156 --> 22:42.359
The police don't even
have this footage.

22:42.393 --> 22:47.365
And this is what really happened
in the woods back in 1984.

22:48.531 --> 22:51.468
And that camera was
never found until now.

22:52.836 --> 22:55.373
To tell you the truth, I
don't even know how I have it.

22:55.405 --> 23:00.411
I just woke up and right
next to my bed was this book.

23:02.346 --> 23:06.718
And then, all the memories
came flooding back to me.

23:09.953 --> 23:13.423
It was, I had somehow
forgotten them,

23:14.892 --> 23:19.397
but now I know why I am who I
am, why I studied the occult,

23:20.130 --> 23:21.832
why I have these dreams,

23:21.865 --> 23:25.903
why I can't sleep for more
than three hours a night,

23:25.935 --> 23:30.540
and why I feel like I'm being
pulled into another dimension.

23:32.977 --> 23:34.479
He's been trying to come back.

23:35.878 --> 23:38.949
Satan's been whispering in
my ear for the past 30 years.

23:44.520 --> 23:49.527
Now, I'll show you
if you dare watch the story,

23:50.394 --> 23:53.530
the murders in Aztakea woods

23:53.564 --> 23:56.567
in Northport, 1984, Long Island.

23:57.768 --> 23:59.002
This is completely unedited.

23:59.036 --> 24:00.871
I don't know why I'm
fucking showing this.

24:17.887 --> 24:20.557
Going into the woods but, and.

24:22.960 --> 24:24.729
Dude, you
know where it was.

24:24.761 --> 24:26.730
No, I have
no idea where it is.

24:26.763 --> 24:28.598
That's good.

24:35.338 --> 24:37.741
All right, this is real good.

24:39.410 --> 24:42.146
Of course she is, you
have to go and stop it.

24:42.179 --> 24:45.048
- It's gonna be awful.
- You better come with me.

24:45.082 --> 24:47.285
Hey, you guys
wanna be in my movie?

24:48.218 --> 24:50.087
- Ew.
- Ew, no.

24:51.454 --> 24:53.323
Michael Campbell,
please do not film people

24:53.356 --> 24:55.093
without their permission!

24:56.259 --> 24:57.827
Mike, where the fuck
did you get that camera?

24:57.861 --> 24:59.397
It's for Mrs.
Rose's art project.

24:59.430 --> 25:00.765
It's supposed to be room loops

25:00.798 --> 25:02.566
or just like video of your room.

25:02.598 --> 25:04.201
But my mom won't let
me shoot our house.

25:04.233 --> 25:05.668
Why not?

25:05.701 --> 25:06.836
I don't know,
something about the bunch

25:06.869 --> 25:08.638
of recent robbery,
she's totally paranoid.

25:08.672 --> 25:13.210
Right, this fucking kid,

25:13.242 --> 25:16.946
please don't mention anything
else about Black Sabbath.

25:16.980 --> 25:18.149
Come on, man,
you know Sabbath.

25:18.182 --> 25:19.349
Please try for
the rest of the day,

25:19.383 --> 25:20.584
just try not to
mention one thing...

25:20.616 --> 25:22.318
Sabbath rules, man,
you know no guitars

25:22.352 --> 25:25.389
- is heavier than Tony Iommi.
- Except Buck Dharma.

25:25.422 --> 25:27.391
And don't forget
Eddie van Halen.

25:34.298 --> 25:35.766
Guys, guys,
what's this like fucking

25:35.798 --> 25:40.070
like tree house like fucking
birdhouse doing in the woods?

25:40.104 --> 25:41.605
Oh, shit.

25:41.637 --> 25:43.540
Hey look,
Ritch, it's about the size

25:43.574 --> 25:45.009
of your girlfriend's cunt.

25:45.041 --> 25:46.910
Yeah, it's
'cause my cock is so huge.

25:46.943 --> 25:48.979
Shit, shit.

25:49.011 --> 25:52.082
What a bunch
of fucking pussies.

25:54.585 --> 25:56.086
Neat camera, where'd
you steal it from?

25:56.119 --> 25:58.488
It's Mrs. Rose, so
you better not fuck with it.

25:58.521 --> 26:01.157
It's Mrs. Rose, so you better
not fuck with it.

26:01.191 --> 26:02.527
Who give a f...

26:03.759 --> 26:05.496
Actually, Mrs. Rose
is pretty cool.

26:09.298 --> 26:11.568
So, what are you
guys, like a gang?

26:12.970 --> 26:15.807
No, we're a cult, The
Knights of the Black Circle.

26:17.540 --> 26:18.509
I see.

26:18.541 --> 26:20.677
We're fucking Satanists, man.

26:20.711 --> 26:23.047
And if you tell anyone,
we'll fucking kill you.

26:24.515 --> 26:25.516
Don't tell anyone,

26:26.717 --> 26:28.920
doesn't Einstein realize
we're filming this shit?

26:30.354 --> 26:32.023
Hey, you guys
wanna see something?

26:33.289 --> 26:34.959
You wanna see the
power of Satan?

26:36.160 --> 26:39.363
Yeah, let's
see the power of Satan.

26:39.395 --> 26:40.664
But first.

26:42.031 --> 26:45.336
Oh, thank God.

26:48.105 --> 26:50.674
I need my medicine.

26:52.308 --> 26:53.277
You gonna share that?

26:56.078 --> 27:00.416
- Maybe.
- Give me that shit, fuck it.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.819
- I guess we are.
- You fucking idiot.

27:03.953 --> 27:05.255
- I'm sorry.
- The fuck's wrong with you?

27:07.391 --> 27:09.192
A lot of things, I guess.

27:09.226 --> 27:11.729
Where did you get
that jacket, Dafans?

27:11.761 --> 27:13.563
You're
a jokester, huh?

27:15.432 --> 27:16.800
The fuck you think's funny?

27:18.268 --> 27:20.069
Dafans, the jacket.

27:20.103 --> 27:21.105
There's
nothing around, dude.

27:21.137 --> 27:22.239
Are you guys
gonna inhale that weed

27:22.271 --> 27:23.840
or are you just gonna waste it?

27:25.541 --> 27:28.011
You guys think you guys
are real jokesters, huh?

27:28.912 --> 27:30.314
You wanna see something funny?

27:31.214 --> 27:33.049
Fucking follow me, this way.

27:45.127 --> 27:48.097
Don't get
to close to that, man.

27:48.131 --> 27:49.934
You can summon Satan
with that shit.

27:51.134 --> 27:52.135
You think that's funny, queer?

27:52.169 --> 27:53.804
Sounds like bullshit.

27:53.836 --> 27:55.004
You have to sacrifice...

27:55.038 --> 27:56.507
Shut the fuck up, Terry.

27:56.539 --> 27:58.908
What are you
guys doing with that cat?

27:58.942 --> 28:00.443
Yeah, you
better not hurt it.

28:00.477 --> 28:01.946
Whoa, whoa, all
right, relax, okay?

28:01.979 --> 28:04.782
It's my sister's cat, I just
gotta watch it for the weekend.

28:04.815 --> 28:07.451
So, you don't mind
if we tape everyone, do you?

28:07.483 --> 28:09.220
Go right ahead,
what do I care?

28:09.252 --> 28:11.621
We'll be on the other
side soon, anyways.

28:11.654 --> 28:12.855
The fourth dimension, man.

28:12.888 --> 28:14.757
Oh my God,
this kid's been at it.

28:14.790 --> 28:19.062
No, no, no, I heard
Aleister Crowley used to talk

28:19.096 --> 28:22.766
about the fourth dimension,
Satan rules over it.

28:22.798 --> 28:24.367
- Mr. Crowley.
- Mr. Crowley!

28:24.401 --> 28:26.370
- You've been reading too many...
- No, no, no, no.

28:26.403 --> 28:28.639
Your friend here
nailed it, okay?

28:28.672 --> 28:29.839
The Thelmians knew about it.

28:29.873 --> 28:31.475
That's the religion
Crowley started,

28:31.508 --> 28:32.742
but it goes back
farther, though,

28:32.776 --> 28:34.711
to like the ancient
Egyptians and shit.

28:34.744 --> 28:37.480
Then Anton LaVey came
along, he knew about majik.

28:37.513 --> 28:40.917
That's M-A-J-I-K,
it's conjuring.

28:40.951 --> 28:43.687
You can talk to Satan,
and he's alive and well.

28:43.720 --> 28:45.489
It's in the fucking
Bible, all right?

28:45.521 --> 28:47.290
He's supposed to be
free after 1,000 years.

28:47.324 --> 28:49.393
All right, so,
how do you summon Satan?

28:49.425 --> 28:52.428
Ugh, I don't
feel so good, tell him.

28:52.461 --> 28:54.064
Well, I've been researching,

28:54.096 --> 28:56.567
and there's all kinds of
rituals you have to follow,

28:56.599 --> 28:59.202
but until I find a book
with a certain chant,

28:59.236 --> 29:01.238
I can't do it, and I've tried
a million different ways.

29:01.270 --> 29:02.839
Wait, what book?

29:02.873 --> 29:04.975
'Cause my uncle owns a
bookstore up in Main.

29:05.008 --> 29:10.014
He specializes in those weird
like hard to find books.

29:10.881 --> 29:12.316
He could get any book on loan.

29:12.348 --> 29:14.384
Yeah, yeah, yeah, his
books are always mint, man.

29:14.417 --> 29:15.585
Needless Things, right?

29:16.486 --> 29:17.955
Uh.

29:17.988 --> 29:19.490
The book's been translated
into different languages.

29:19.522 --> 29:21.891
But the text, now the
text is in a language

29:21.924 --> 29:23.092
that no one can decipher.

29:23.125 --> 29:25.061
So, most experts
think it's bullshit.

29:25.095 --> 29:27.364
It has some kickass
drawings in it, though.

29:27.396 --> 29:30.266
I've seen pictures in
another book about it.

29:30.299 --> 29:32.168
People mangled with machinery,

29:32.201 --> 29:34.904
animals with wheels implanted
into 'em, and crazy shit.

29:34.938 --> 29:37.107
Supposedly, the guy who
wrote it was in a trance.

29:37.140 --> 29:39.076
And he entered Satan's kingdom
in the fourth dimension

29:39.108 --> 29:40.711
and he came back with the words,

29:42.112 --> 29:44.648
with the words the allow
the Devil to come back here.

29:44.681 --> 29:46.350
- The book is called...
- Hits, hits!

29:46.383 --> 29:48.018
Oh, shit, cops, go, go, go.

29:48.050 --> 29:49.252
God damned kids!

30:06.670 --> 30:09.907
Mike, can we see any part
of your video project yet?

30:09.940 --> 30:11.709
I'm filming
it right now.

30:12.942 --> 30:15.046
What's up with you two,
you look fucked up?

30:17.213 --> 30:20.483
We're on acid, Ritchie
got it from Jimmy.

30:22.318 --> 30:25.422
- I'm so sure.
- No, really.

30:25.454 --> 30:27.891
We're tripping our faces
off, dude.

30:29.692 --> 30:34.431
You look like a fucking
replica from "Blade Runner".

30:34.463 --> 30:38.134
No, no, he looks
more like a scanner.

30:38.167 --> 30:40.670
Run, his head's gonna
explode!

30:44.907 --> 30:46.476
Wait, I have a joke.

30:46.509 --> 30:48.979
You are a joke, man.

30:49.011 --> 30:51.115
Wait, no, no, listen, listen.

30:51.147 --> 30:55.818
All right, so this guy
joins the Army, right?

30:55.852 --> 30:59.390
And after the first week, he
realizes he's in this big...

31:01.258 --> 31:02.726
What the fuck do you call 'em?

31:02.759 --> 31:05.328
Barracks, all right,
he's in this big,

31:05.362 --> 31:06.630
he's in this big barracks,

31:06.663 --> 31:09.732
sharing a room with
like 100 other guys.

31:09.766 --> 31:11.000
And he's really horny,

31:11.034 --> 31:13.437
but he can't whack
off because, you know,

31:13.470 --> 31:15.506
all the other guys are
around and stuff, you know?

31:15.538 --> 31:17.607
So, he goes to the sergeant,

31:17.641 --> 31:21.144
and he's like, "Sarge,
I got a problem.

31:21.178 --> 31:26.183
"I'm really horny, but I got
nowhere to take care of it,

31:27.049 --> 31:28.484
"if you know what I mean."

31:28.518 --> 31:30.754
And the sergeant's like, "Yeah,
yeah, I know what you mean.

31:30.787 --> 31:32.155
"I know exactly what
you're talking about.

31:32.189 --> 31:34.091
"We got just the
thing for that."

31:34.124 --> 31:37.227
So, he brings him around
the corner of the tent

31:37.259 --> 31:40.897
to this big barrel with the
little hole in the side.

31:40.931 --> 31:44.802
And he's like, "Go ahead,
stick your pecker in there."

31:44.835 --> 31:46.470
In the barrel?

31:46.502 --> 31:48.239
Yeah, in the barrel.

31:49.673 --> 31:53.644
So he puts his thing inside
the barrel and he's just like,

31:54.845 --> 31:59.583
"Oh, God,"
he's like, "Holy shit.

32:01.718 --> 32:04.421
"Oh my God, this is
fucking awesome."

32:04.453 --> 32:09.426
And he's like, "Sarge,"
he says to him,

32:10.626 --> 32:12.061
"you can use it
anytime you want.

32:12.962 --> 32:15.499
"Except on Tuesdays."

32:15.531 --> 32:18.601
So the guy's like, "Why,
what happens on Tuesdays?"

32:20.002 --> 32:24.808
And so, the Sarge goes, "That's
your day inside the barrel."

32:26.375 --> 32:31.382
You get it?

32:32.115 --> 32:33.217
I didn't think so.

32:39.256 --> 32:42.560
That's good, that's
one of my better jokes.

32:46.529 --> 32:47.998
Gerry told me he's gay.

32:49.932 --> 32:51.401
What?

32:51.433 --> 32:54.171
He tried touching me
right before you walked in.

32:54.203 --> 32:55.471
No, I didn't.

32:55.505 --> 32:58.642
Then, then why is your
penis so hard?

33:00.076 --> 33:01.211
You mother fucker!

33:05.115 --> 33:06.916
Hey, cut the shit,
you two, you're gonna kill him!

33:06.950 --> 33:08.184
I'll
fucking kill you!

33:08.218 --> 33:09.353
You're just
having a bad trip!

33:09.385 --> 33:10.988
Get the fuck off of me,

33:12.021 --> 33:14.191
- fucking asshole.
- Fucking pussy.

33:14.223 --> 33:15.525
Get the fuck outta here.

33:16.960 --> 33:18.328
Fucking piece of shit.

33:23.767 --> 33:26.237
Eddie Van Halen is still
better than Tony Iommi.

33:27.804 --> 33:31.709
Ladies and gentlemen,
the moment has arrived.

33:32.776 --> 33:34.144
We will now be full members

33:34.176 --> 33:35.645
of the Knights of
the Black Circle.

33:35.679 --> 33:38.215
Fuck the Knights, what
do we need them for?

33:38.248 --> 33:39.950
Shit, I
forgot my BOC tape.

33:39.982 --> 33:42.085
You guys gotta hear this
song, "Take Me Away".

33:42.117 --> 33:45.121
It's fucking heavy, it's about
aliens abducting this dude

33:45.154 --> 33:46.956
that wants to be taken
away from his shit home.

33:46.990 --> 33:49.559
Mike, could you
please shut the fuck up

33:49.593 --> 33:52.062
so I could get this
damned thing open?

33:52.095 --> 33:55.332
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- I'm having

33:55.365 --> 33:57.701
- a hard time here.
- Come on, come on.

33:57.733 --> 34:02.371
I'm trying.

34:02.404 --> 34:03.205
- There we go.
- Pfft,

34:03.239 --> 34:04.408
what the fuck is that?

34:04.441 --> 34:08.777
Wait, there's more.

34:08.811 --> 34:12.348
Yes, oh, I want more
bubble wrap, me too.

34:16.518 --> 34:19.188
Oh, I forgot to
tell you guys this.

34:19.222 --> 34:22.092
- This weed was dusted.
- What's dusted?

34:23.760 --> 34:27.931
This book is fucking creepy.

34:27.963 --> 34:30.467
Shit, hold it up
so I can film it better.

34:32.702 --> 34:35.639
Holy shit, man.

34:37.706 --> 34:39.442
- What the fuck was that?
- I don't know.

34:39.476 --> 34:44.481
I can't get it, Jesus.

34:46.849 --> 34:48.150
Let's see if you
could do any better.

34:48.184 --> 34:50.621
- You suck, watch.
- Yeah, I have one.

34:50.652 --> 34:55.659
Fuck.-

34:56.393 --> 34:57.561
You suck worse than me.

34:57.594 --> 34:58.961
- Shut the fuck up.
- Yeah, we all suck

34:58.994 --> 35:01.764
at burping, you
guys, let's see that.

35:01.797 --> 35:04.000
"Seraphinian
Necronomicon".

35:07.603 --> 35:11.907
You okay, Ger?

35:11.940 --> 35:13.876
Geez man, what the hell?

35:15.778 --> 35:19.449
Fuck, dude.

35:21.251 --> 35:23.019
Did he eat something?

35:30.393 --> 35:33.829
Dude, I
don't know what to do.

35:37.701 --> 35:38.802
Hey,
Gerry, say something,

35:38.835 --> 35:42.204
man, are you all right?

35:42.237 --> 35:43.639
It's that fucking book.

35:43.672 --> 35:46.342
Dude, what happened?

36:08.697 --> 36:11.567
Buck Dharma totally
smells Eddie Van Halen.

36:14.570 --> 36:15.871
Sweetheart,

36:15.905 --> 36:17.007
you're gonna be late for school.

36:17.039 --> 36:18.375
Just a second!

36:22.778 --> 36:26.282
All right, Mike, this
is Wendy and Susan.

36:26.315 --> 36:29.018
They're sisters.

36:29.052 --> 36:29.887
No, duh.

36:32.088 --> 36:35.359
Ah, warm PBRs are
better than no PBRs.

36:37.760 --> 36:40.496
Mike, take it slow.

36:40.530 --> 36:45.536
- You don't wanna P-U-K-E.
- You're not like six.

36:46.802 --> 36:49.306
We can spell you, you idiot.

37:11.994 --> 37:13.195
What's with the camera?

37:13.228 --> 37:14.130
It's for
Mrs. Rose class.

37:14.164 --> 37:15.766
I'm doing it as a video project.

37:15.798 --> 37:20.804
Can we be in it,
please, please, please?

37:21.938 --> 37:23.306
Please, please, please,

37:23.338 --> 37:26.309
please, please, please,
please, please, please, please?

37:27.777 --> 37:31.914
Oh, fuck yeah.

37:31.947 --> 37:35.918
Okay, you can be in, I
think you got the part.

37:35.952 --> 37:38.088
Hey, so I read three
lines from that book.

37:38.121 --> 37:39.588
When?

37:39.621 --> 37:44.228
Yesterday, the picture
had a girl giving herself

37:45.695 --> 37:48.398
to a guy, or maybe it was
a werewolf, I don't know.

37:48.431 --> 37:53.436
Anyways, I read the chant,
and next thing you know,

37:54.570 --> 37:56.405
I'm at the gazebo
with the two sisters,

37:57.472 --> 37:59.742
and the rest is history.

38:01.277 --> 38:02.979
Man, those
chicks are freaky.

38:03.012 --> 38:05.916
Did you see them totally
making out, that shit was hot?

38:05.949 --> 38:07.818
Yeah, it's a Satanic miracle.

38:07.851 --> 38:09.920
The guy who can't
even score one girl

38:09.952 --> 38:12.188
gets not one but
two lovely ladies

38:12.222 --> 38:14.291
and manages to bring
them out to the woods?

38:15.391 --> 38:18.162
Holy shit.

38:21.396 --> 38:24.201
There's nothing holy about it.

38:33.275 --> 38:35.411
Yeah, I'm sure
it was a werewolf.

38:35.445 --> 38:38.849
You guys are fucking dicks.

38:38.882 --> 38:40.918
Dude, where
the fuck is Ritchie?

38:42.284 --> 38:45.454
I don't know, I haven't
seen him in so long.

38:45.487 --> 38:47.223
I think he got
kicked outta school.

38:48.590 --> 38:49.826
He cut out so many
frigging times.

38:49.858 --> 38:52.161
And then he showed
up to Nadler's class,

38:52.195 --> 38:54.364
tripping his fucking face off.

38:54.396 --> 38:55.565
Nadler's class?

38:55.597 --> 38:57.433
- No wonder he got kicked out.
- Yeah.

39:00.302 --> 39:01.503
I tried calling him,

39:01.536 --> 39:02.905
but his mom said he
wasn't available.

39:02.938 --> 39:05.541
What does, "Wasn't
available," mean anyway?

39:05.574 --> 39:06.777
I have no idea.

39:08.777 --> 39:10.680
Look, he probably...

39:11.947 --> 39:12.782
What?

39:14.317 --> 39:15.418
Spit it out, Gilligan.

39:16.885 --> 39:19.755
I don't know, remember it
was his turn with the book?

39:19.789 --> 39:21.258
Yeah, so?

39:21.291 --> 39:26.263
Well, he said that he
figured out the text.

39:26.295 --> 39:28.063
He said he could
actually understand all

39:28.097 --> 39:31.201
that fucking gibberish,
said an angel came

39:31.233 --> 39:33.036
to him in a dream
and touched him.

39:33.068 --> 39:34.271
Oh, maybe
it was that angel

39:34.304 --> 39:37.206
from that CZ Top video,
I wish she'd touch me.

39:37.239 --> 39:42.245
No, it was a black angel, he
said, from Satan's universe,

39:43.413 --> 39:45.615
or hell, or whatever
the fuck he read.

39:45.648 --> 39:49.552
I have no clue, but
she had black wings,

39:49.585 --> 39:52.222
and she was touching
his forehead and shit.

39:53.489 --> 39:54.324
I don't know.

39:55.791 --> 39:57.092
Okay, how about this?

39:57.126 --> 39:58.495
He wakes up in the morning

39:58.527 --> 40:01.030
and the book is on
his fucking chest.

40:01.063 --> 40:04.466
Meanwhile, the night before
he, hides it in his closet

40:04.500 --> 40:06.103
so his old man wouldn't find it.

40:07.704 --> 40:10.740
How does a book that he hid
in his closet the night before

40:10.773 --> 40:12.575
end up on his chest
the next morning?

40:12.608 --> 40:14.845
I mean, tell me that
is not unbelievable.

40:15.978 --> 40:18.414
You actually
believe that shit?

40:18.447 --> 40:19.548
Ritch has been doing like a hit

40:19.581 --> 40:21.083
of acid every day for a month.

40:21.117 --> 40:22.719
He's nuts, that's all.

40:23.820 --> 40:24.655
I don't know.

40:26.121 --> 40:28.858
The last time that I spoke
to him, he sounded weird.

40:30.193 --> 40:33.129
And it wasn't drugs.

40:33.161 --> 40:35.764
Like, he just sounded weird.

40:35.797 --> 40:40.803
Like I think he's obsessed.

40:44.007 --> 40:47.077
- Oh my God, Ritchie.
- How's school, losers?

40:47.110 --> 40:50.046
Hey man, where
the fuck you been?

40:50.079 --> 40:52.615
You look like shit,
did you lose 10 pounds?

40:52.648 --> 40:54.017
Yeah, and where's my book?

40:54.916 --> 40:57.619
Your book, your book?

40:57.652 --> 40:59.121
- Yeah, my book.
- It's all

40:59.155 --> 41:01.358
of mankind's book, man, and
it's opening up a portal

41:01.391 --> 41:02.759
- to the fourth dimension.
- Yup, he's lost it.

41:02.791 --> 41:04.159
- Exactly.
- I'm not joking, man.

41:04.193 --> 41:05.662
This shit, it works.

41:06.963 --> 41:10.432
Every time I do an incantation,
I feel this powers.

41:10.465 --> 41:13.569
It's better than any drug
I've ever done before.

41:14.771 --> 41:16.473
- And I can hear him.
- Oh my God.

41:16.505 --> 41:17.740
I hear the whispers.

41:18.875 --> 41:20.909
Yeah, how many
drugs have you done?

41:20.943 --> 41:22.912
You look like you're
losing it, are you okay?

41:22.945 --> 41:25.115
- I'm fine, man.
- Hey, fuck off me.

41:25.148 --> 41:27.650
- Are you nuts?
- Hey, I'll show you.

41:30.420 --> 41:31.253
I'm right here.

41:32.855 --> 41:34.123
Dude, get the
fuck down from there.

41:34.157 --> 41:35.492
Ritchie, what
the fuck you doing?

41:35.525 --> 41:37.494
Get down, you're gonna fall.

41:37.527 --> 41:39.262
I'm over here.

41:39.295 --> 41:41.630
- What the fuck?
- What the fuck did?

41:41.664 --> 41:42.766
Ritchie, how
the fuck did, okay,

41:42.798 --> 41:44.134
where the fuck did he go?

41:44.166 --> 41:45.201
I'm right here.

41:45.233 --> 41:46.369
What are you doing?

41:46.402 --> 41:47.170
It's
fucking impossible.

41:47.202 --> 41:48.304
Holy shit!

41:51.440 --> 41:53.709
So, I've been
studying the book,

41:53.742 --> 41:55.577
and there were all these
different incantations.

41:55.610 --> 41:58.781
So, like warmups for the
final materialization.

41:58.815 --> 42:01.251
And once the door is
breached, he enters,

42:01.284 --> 42:03.653
and it's only happened like
12 other times in history

42:03.686 --> 42:04.653
when he's come over.

42:04.686 --> 42:05.954
But he could never
hold on to his power

42:05.987 --> 42:07.256
and he had to go back.

42:07.289 --> 42:09.391
He was thinking too
big and too broadly,

42:09.425 --> 42:11.094
getting into politics
and world affairs.

42:11.126 --> 42:14.130
But now he knows
he's gotta sneak in

42:14.163 --> 42:15.798
by tearing a small
rip in the curtain,

42:15.831 --> 42:17.701
building an army of darkness.

42:20.068 --> 42:21.271
So, this is
why we haven't seen you

42:21.304 --> 42:22.472
in over a month?

42:22.505 --> 42:25.474
No, I got an Atari,
"Space Invaders".

42:25.507 --> 42:26.742
It's unbelievable, man.

42:27.943 --> 42:29.311
So, what's next?

42:29.344 --> 42:31.914
Well, in order
to get some power,

42:31.947 --> 42:33.615
you have to sacrifice something.

42:33.648 --> 42:35.717
That little trick I did
earlier used everything up,

42:35.751 --> 42:37.354
but I just had to show you guys.

42:39.822 --> 42:40.657
Look over there.

42:47.195 --> 42:49.199
What the fuck is that?

42:52.101 --> 42:55.637
Holy shit, it's Jimmy's
sister's fucking cat.

42:55.670 --> 42:58.841
Fuck, the knife's
still bloody, oh God.

43:00.742 --> 43:02.144
Where's
the fucking head?

43:02.177 --> 43:05.848
Oh my God.

43:15.992 --> 43:17.894
So, I wanna warn the
faithful followers

43:17.927 --> 43:19.429
of the Nightmares
and Dreams Video Blog

43:19.461 --> 43:22.498
that what you're about to
see is the unedited truth.

43:22.532 --> 43:25.702
It's not for the faint
of heart or from minors.

43:25.735 --> 43:28.472
Hopefully you didn't hack
into your daddy's PC.

43:34.443 --> 43:35.345
You may not believe your eyes

43:35.378 --> 43:37.080
of what you're about to witness.

43:37.112 --> 43:39.948
It's none other than Satan
himself being summoned.

43:41.449 --> 43:43.285
I made you chocolate chip
cookies, your favorite.

43:47.489 --> 43:50.058
Mike, why did you bring
me out here in the woods?

43:50.092 --> 43:52.628
And what are you always
filming everything for?

43:52.661 --> 43:54.596
I told you, it's
for Mrs. Rose's art class.

43:54.630 --> 43:58.233
It's supposed to be room
loops, not woods loops.

43:58.266 --> 44:01.904
Whatever, that's like the
stupidest thing I've ever heard.

44:01.938 --> 44:05.208
Just hold this while
I read this chant.

44:27.230 --> 44:28.597
Fuck, Susan, where did you go?

44:28.630 --> 44:33.502
Susan, Susan, Susan,
where are you, Susan?

44:36.838 --> 44:38.373
What the fuck?

44:38.407 --> 44:40.476
What the fuck, where
the fuck did she go?

44:40.509 --> 44:43.246
She's fucking gone,
she's fucking dead.

44:43.278 --> 44:47.317
Holy shit, holy shit,
holy shit, Susan!

44:48.284 --> 44:50.820
What the fuck, holy shit, Susan!

44:52.822 --> 44:54.791
What the fuck, it it
wasn't raining a second ago.

44:54.824 --> 44:56.693
Fuck the rain, you
guys gotta see the footage,

44:56.726 --> 44:57.927
she's fucking dead!

44:57.960 --> 44:59.228
Why the fuck you
still filming then?

44:59.262 --> 45:00.463
We have to destroy it.

45:00.496 --> 45:02.264
It proves we
didn't do anything.

45:06.601 --> 45:09.871
You guys, I think this
fucking hole ate her.

45:09.905 --> 45:13.543
Yo, fuck you, I'm with Mike,
we film everything from now on.

45:13.576 --> 45:15.644
We have to have proof that
this shit fucking happened.

45:15.677 --> 45:17.579
What, like the fucking
Devil is just gonna step out

45:17.612 --> 45:20.716
for an interview if we say
another spell from the book?

45:20.750 --> 45:23.853
Let me see that you.

45:30.059 --> 45:32.495
What the fuck?

45:33.795 --> 45:36.131
- Holy shit.
- What the fuck just happened?

45:36.164 --> 45:38.967
Doolb, doolb, Natas,

45:39.001 --> 45:42.805
it's Satan, don't you guys
see, it's blood, it's backward?

45:42.838 --> 45:45.875
They're just words, but
everything is backwards.

45:45.907 --> 45:48.243
Doolb is blood, Natas is Satan.

45:48.277 --> 45:52.548
You just asked Satan to bathe
you in doolb, I mean, blood.

45:53.882 --> 45:55.284
What, that fucking thing

45:55.318 --> 45:56.786
just almost hit me in the head.

45:58.688 --> 45:59.990
Fuck, let's go.

46:05.094 --> 46:06.028
Go, go, go!

46:07.228 --> 46:09.631
Let's get
the fuck out of here!

46:25.146 --> 46:26.982
What the fuck?

46:27.016 --> 46:28.184
You realize we should have run

46:28.217 --> 46:29.251
into Church Street
by now, right?

46:29.284 --> 46:30.619
No, we should have run
into the harbor by now.

46:30.652 --> 46:31.987
Where the fuck are we?

46:34.923 --> 46:38.061
The fucking hole, how
the did we get back here?

46:39.527 --> 46:40.896
Gerry, goes what
page the book is open to!

46:40.929 --> 46:43.198
Fuck no, why doesn't
Satan's lover over here do it?

46:43.231 --> 46:46.402
- Don't call me that?
- Shut the fuck up, Ritchie!

46:46.434 --> 46:48.737
You're the one who got us
into all this crazy shit.

46:49.972 --> 46:51.407
What the fuck has it shown?

46:51.440 --> 46:53.742
I'll go do it myself.

47:01.416 --> 47:03.251
It says, "Final incantation

47:03.284 --> 47:06.221
"for materialization
of the Dark Lord.

47:06.255 --> 47:08.925
"Ye who read these words now sit

47:08.958 --> 47:10.760
"at the side of the Desolate One

47:10.793 --> 47:13.963
"who shall reclaim
dominion over this world

47:13.996 --> 47:17.066
"and all other
dimensions within."

47:17.099 --> 47:20.870
Holy shit, the hole's bleeding.

47:20.902 --> 47:24.440
Let me see that,
move, I wanna read this.

47:27.510 --> 47:29.579
Don't say these words.

47:29.612 --> 47:32.581
Oh, Ritchie, don't say
these words, Ritchie!

47:32.614 --> 47:35.083
Ritchie, don't say these
words, come on, Ritchie!

47:35.117 --> 47:37.019
- Don't say these word.
- Hey, honey!

47:38.186 --> 47:41.824
Don't say these words,
don't say these words!

47:42.958 --> 47:47.764
Say you love Satan!

48:03.077 --> 48:04.847
Hey, what's up, eh?

48:06.382 --> 48:07.650
- You doing all right?
- Yeah, I am.

48:07.682 --> 48:09.518
I did not do
this, I am innocent,

48:09.552 --> 48:12.155
and I have to tell you and
you, I did not do this.

48:12.188 --> 48:13.689
I don't know why
nobody will believe me,

48:13.722 --> 48:15.158
- but I am so outta here.
- Hey, hey!

48:15.190 --> 48:16.358
What the hell is up with this?

48:16.391 --> 48:17.926
Where
you going, come on,

48:17.960 --> 48:19.195
what are you doing?

48:19.228 --> 48:20.695
- Let's go.
- I'm trying to tell you.

48:20.728 --> 48:22.197
- No one will believe em.
- How did she get in here,

48:22.231 --> 48:23.566
- anyway, in the first place?
- What, isn't that

48:23.599 --> 48:25.334
- that rock star?
- Hey, you need to shut up

48:25.367 --> 48:27.670
and come with me,
move it, let's go.

48:29.405 --> 48:30.673
What was that?

48:30.706 --> 48:32.474
That show was some crazy shit.

48:32.507 --> 48:34.210
Yeah, what do you think?

48:34.242 --> 48:36.711
Maybe those kids at Long
Island that disappeared?

48:36.744 --> 48:38.146
Christ, do you think
there's a connection?

48:38.179 --> 48:39.714
That's all we need.

48:39.748 --> 48:41.951
Yeah, I hate the weird ones.

48:41.983 --> 48:44.386
Speaking of which, I
wanna show you something.

48:56.030 --> 48:57.366
What the hell is this?

48:58.701 --> 49:00.202
It's totally unrelatable,
but this whole thing

49:00.235 --> 49:02.137
with Schneider has
got me thinking,

49:02.170 --> 49:05.207
this happened when I was
in L.A. about 10 years ago.

49:05.240 --> 49:08.244
A cable repair guy murdered
three residential customers

49:08.277 --> 49:09.512
before being gunned down.

49:12.081 --> 49:12.916
It's horrible.

49:13.916 --> 49:16.152
- A cable repair guy?
- Yeah.

49:19.621 --> 49:23.192
He claimed the Devil live
inside his cable box.

49:24.559 --> 49:27.029
Wonderful, now I've
officially heard everything.

49:30.065 --> 49:33.001
It's horrible.

49:33.034 --> 49:34.803
We've gotta her
her temperature down.

49:40.775 --> 49:45.781
Dr. Goode.

49:59.594 --> 50:04.600
I'll be back.

50:15.010 --> 50:16.179
You've been infected.

50:18.213 --> 50:19.981
Pal, I got
allergies, all right?

50:20.014 --> 50:21.116
It's a real bitch.

50:22.952 --> 50:25.254
- What about your partner?
- You know what?

50:25.286 --> 50:27.689
Maybe you ought to worry
about yourself for now.

50:35.297 --> 50:38.134
There's not a blemish
on this guy's record.

50:38.166 --> 50:40.235
I mean, he's never even
had a speeding ticket.

50:40.268 --> 50:42.971
Well, maybe he snapped, I
mean, we've seen that before.

50:43.005 --> 50:46.242
He's supposed to be some kind
of hot shot computer expert.

50:46.275 --> 50:49.045
His specialty's creating
antivirus software.

50:49.077 --> 50:50.579
The guy's loaded.

50:50.612 --> 50:52.681
Just last week, some
European company transferred

50:52.715 --> 50:54.517
a couple of mill to
his bank account.

50:56.150 --> 50:58.153
Any word on the
woman in the trunk?

50:58.186 --> 50:59.955
Nothing so far.

50:59.989 --> 51:01.356
Get on that, all right?

51:01.389 --> 51:03.158
I also need you to look
at the dashboard footage

51:03.192 --> 51:05.226
from both squad cars.

51:05.260 --> 51:06.362
Okay.

51:20.442 --> 51:22.545
Just what are we
gonna find on this one?

51:35.657 --> 51:37.826
This lovely looking
thing femme fatale

51:37.860 --> 51:42.798
is Magdalena Forte,
my soon to be ex-wife.

51:42.831 --> 51:46.568
Don't let the glamor fool
you, she's a bit of a jerk.

51:46.601 --> 51:49.404
You see, that's not me.

51:49.438 --> 51:53.276
That's Eric Valentine, my
supposedly filmmaking partner.

51:54.476 --> 51:56.945
He and I co-directed, I shot it,

51:56.978 --> 51:59.281
and my celebrity wife
was the producer.

52:00.748 --> 52:03.151
The lady in blue is his
latest person of interest.

52:04.619 --> 52:08.391
And the lady in red, that his
wife's twin sister, Marlene.

52:08.423 --> 52:11.326
She'll do whatever it takes
for a part in his next project.

52:13.161 --> 52:15.196
So, where's his wife, Lilliana?

52:15.230 --> 52:18.000
Apparently they could
only muster up two invites

52:18.032 --> 52:20.802
for the screening, I'm
just the cinematographer,

52:20.835 --> 52:23.071
and Lilliana's just
a supporting actress.

52:23.105 --> 52:25.074
So, no red carpets for us.

52:26.842 --> 52:30.579
That dude there, looking
back to the trailer monitor

52:30.612 --> 52:33.182
is Henry Greenberg,
Eric's managing.

52:34.583 --> 52:36.818
He's making sure Eric
doesn't get totally wasted

52:36.851 --> 52:39.521
before his Q and A
after the screening.

52:39.554 --> 52:42.223
He's also making
sure Eric and my wife

52:42.257 --> 52:43.559
don't have a lover's quarrel

52:43.592 --> 52:45.827
when they're supposed
to promote the film.

52:45.860 --> 52:48.897
Meanwhile, back in Eric's
production high out,

52:48.931 --> 52:51.599
I'm setting up cameras for
a live show that will air

52:51.632 --> 52:54.669
in the very monitoring they're
using to show the trailer.

52:54.702 --> 52:56.739
And Eric's wife, Lilliana?

52:56.771 --> 52:59.541
Well, she's the fucking star.

53:02.277 --> 53:04.847
Nice.

53:04.880 --> 53:06.282
Gotta give it to you, Eric,

53:06.315 --> 53:08.784
you own some pretty
bad ass gear.

53:10.018 --> 53:12.454
I sold those receipts
for the Alexa bodies,

53:12.487 --> 53:14.156
but the ship date's
for next month.

53:18.693 --> 53:19.862
So, I would have
thought you would have

53:19.894 --> 53:21.797
at least taken the Epic
with you to Khan's.

53:22.965 --> 53:24.533
But like you told
your line producer,

53:24.565 --> 53:27.335
why transfer it overseas what
you can rent for cheaper?

53:34.943 --> 53:38.581
So awesome, love
these RED Pro Primes.

53:39.447 --> 53:41.049
So underrated for the price.

53:42.550 --> 53:43.952
Complained about this?

53:43.985 --> 53:46.288
Oh, you're just a snob, right?

53:54.463 --> 53:56.599
You left the GoPros behind too.

53:56.632 --> 53:58.099
So, I'm guessing
you finally bought

53:58.132 --> 54:00.302
those Blackmagic cameras
you've been ranting about.

54:03.271 --> 54:05.173
These microphones
are pretty good too.

54:10.679 --> 54:12.280
Aren't GoPros awesome?

54:12.313 --> 54:14.549
You can put 'em anywhere.

54:14.583 --> 54:16.085
I'm sure your red carpet sendoff

54:16.117 --> 54:18.286
is gonna be a great
warmup for France,

54:18.320 --> 54:19.722
but I'm having
quite a bit of fun

54:19.755 --> 54:23.425
with a small but interesting
crew, including Henry,

54:23.458 --> 54:25.695
the bouncer that punched
you out last summer.

54:27.862 --> 54:29.431
He's our boom operator.

54:32.467 --> 54:35.871
And Paco, your
favorite custodian,

54:35.903 --> 54:37.907
who you hated because you swear

54:37.940 --> 54:40.675
you caught both our
wives checking him out.

54:40.708 --> 54:42.877
Well now, when I
hustled up the crew

54:42.911 --> 54:44.713
and broke into your apartment,

54:44.746 --> 54:47.081
he's the first guy I thought of.

55:08.369 --> 55:11.840
Tada, this is the money shot,

55:11.873 --> 55:13.041
but don't get me wrong.

55:13.074 --> 55:15.543
These other angles would
be pretty good too.

55:15.577 --> 55:17.746
You know, I always
deliver you your coverage.

55:17.778 --> 55:19.280
We've never had to go back

55:19.313 --> 55:21.817
to a location because we
didn't get enough coverage.

55:27.922 --> 55:32.427
Our movie star's here.

55:36.331 --> 55:38.367
Wow, Manny, what
a setup.

55:39.867 --> 55:43.739
Whoa, your wife is looking
especially hot today, Eric.

55:43.771 --> 55:48.777
- I'm gonna love this.
- Manny, why so many cameras?

55:49.878 --> 55:51.046
Because
you're a star, Lilliana,

55:51.079 --> 55:54.016
- you're a fucking star.
- Well, I brought

55:56.717 --> 56:00.388
four different outfits,
I hope you like them.

56:00.422 --> 56:01.990
I'm sure
I'm gonna like them.

56:02.023 --> 56:04.893
But I have a feeling you're
probably just gonna need one.

56:06.994 --> 56:09.565
Which one do you want
me to try on first?

56:09.597 --> 56:11.099
Surprise me, Lilliana.

56:11.132 --> 56:13.234
Go in the bathroom and put
on whichever one you want.

56:13.268 --> 56:14.737
No matter what you wear,

56:14.769 --> 56:17.706
the audience is just gonna
want you to take it off.

56:17.739 --> 56:19.809
You're so silly.

56:22.311 --> 56:23.646
What about makeup?

56:24.880 --> 56:26.715
Don't you dare hid
that beautiful face

56:26.748 --> 56:28.483
behind a single ounce of makeup.

56:32.186 --> 56:35.056
I'm gonna finish setting up.

56:36.224 --> 56:40.729
All right, I'm gonna
change while you set up.

56:40.762 --> 56:42.198
Don't change too much.

56:47.068 --> 56:51.740
Remember, make me look good.

56:53.442 --> 56:55.110
Looking good is
your department.

56:55.143 --> 56:57.413
I'm just here to
make you a star.

57:04.719 --> 57:06.688
This is the camera
you'll be favoring

57:06.722 --> 57:10.059
as you get choked out
into its fixation,

57:10.092 --> 57:12.360
while you will climax
during intercourse.

57:14.396 --> 57:15.631
I know, crazy, right?

57:16.498 --> 57:18.567
That's how Kung Fu died, right?

57:18.599 --> 57:21.769
Hanging from a noose with
his pecker in his hand?

57:21.802 --> 57:24.406
That's what Eric here told
me at the Christmas party.

57:27.509 --> 57:30.179
Anywho, Paco, our
male feature actor

57:30.211 --> 57:32.480
will be lying right
here on your pillow

57:32.514 --> 57:35.050
as your wife crawls up
into our A camera angle

57:35.083 --> 57:38.354
for the big finish,
and guess what?

57:38.387 --> 57:40.990
I'm gonna recruit
just like you like it.

57:41.023 --> 57:44.593
Most cameras remain static,
yet strategically placed,

57:44.626 --> 57:45.828
and check this out.

57:45.860 --> 57:48.297
We'll save even more
money on this freebie

57:48.329 --> 57:52.201
by using your neighborhood
free labor crew.

57:53.068 --> 57:55.204
How's that for cutting corners?

57:55.237 --> 57:58.907
Hey, I didn't even bother with
casting notices on agencies.

57:58.940 --> 58:02.378
Who needs agency when
assholes like you brag

58:02.411 --> 58:05.347
to the fellows that their
wife loves getting choked out

58:05.380 --> 58:08.017
and that she fucks
like a woman possessed?

58:09.451 --> 58:12.387
Really man, guys like you
who share the sexual exploits

58:12.420 --> 58:15.723
with other guys are
just asking for this.

58:15.757 --> 58:17.460
Well now, old husband of mine,

58:18.592 --> 58:20.762
I'm finally number
one on the call sheet.

58:23.130 --> 58:24.599
Hopefully I won't ruin this.

58:25.867 --> 58:27.369
But hey, what
do you always say?

58:27.402 --> 58:31.072
Save money, gold and tits
trump talent any day.

58:31.106 --> 58:33.842
We get it now, Eric, we're
gonna try it your way.

58:33.875 --> 58:35.911
No deal memo and no permits.

58:35.943 --> 58:37.813
That's why we're
here in your office.

58:39.280 --> 58:40.715
No permits necessary.

58:45.019 --> 58:46.722
I can't just set
four static cameras

58:46.755 --> 58:47.856
and hope we get lucky.

59:14.615 --> 59:19.288
Well, I'm kinda nervous,
that rarely happens.

59:19.320 --> 59:20.989
I guess this is
gonna be special.

59:22.556 --> 59:26.294
I know, Eric, a little cheesy,
but fitting, don't you think?

59:28.329 --> 59:31.032
Okay,
Manny, I'm ready.

59:31.065 --> 59:32.934
That's your cue,
Paco, clap three times.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:04.846
It was just you
and me for so long, Eric.

01:03:08.750 --> 01:03:10.885
But with Manny's wife,
you got yourself a ticket

01:03:10.918 --> 01:03:12.020
to ride, didn't you?

01:03:13.253 --> 01:03:15.757
Hollywood is just
way too far away

01:03:15.789 --> 01:03:17.259
without a shortcut, huh?

01:03:20.327 --> 01:03:24.099
So sad when ambition makes
a fool of us all, Eric.

01:03:29.838 --> 01:03:34.843
But damn, why would you share

01:03:37.045 --> 01:03:39.748
how we make love
with your friends?

01:03:41.715 --> 01:03:42.851
Didn't you love me?

01:03:44.119 --> 01:03:45.921
Didn't I belong to only you?

01:03:49.958 --> 01:03:51.593
Just you and me for so long.

01:04:01.369 --> 01:04:03.472
Wait wait,
wait, think about it.

01:04:06.775 --> 01:04:09.644
They're there right
now at the festival.

01:04:11.179 --> 01:04:13.882
Your husband and my wife.

01:04:15.516 --> 01:04:16.751
You got this.

01:07:50.331 --> 01:07:52.800
Boy, there's some pretty
sick people out there.

01:07:52.833 --> 01:07:54.802
I suppose you're gonna
tell me that was real.

01:07:54.835 --> 01:07:56.971
Maybe you should
check out Mount Olive.

01:07:57.005 --> 01:07:59.240
- What's that?
- A church.

01:08:00.375 --> 01:08:02.143
And what do you
think I'm gonna find?

01:08:03.378 --> 01:08:06.048
Perhaps an answer
to your question.

01:08:16.756 --> 01:08:20.595
How could four gorgeous women
like us be going home alone?

01:08:23.564 --> 01:08:26.368
It's tragic, but at least
we have each other.

01:08:28.202 --> 01:08:29.636
I wouldn't call it a loss.

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:32.538
There was one guy at that
party worth pursuing.

01:08:38.179 --> 01:08:39.514
What the hell?

01:08:50.457 --> 01:08:52.594
Hey, it's not to late
to help me stop this.

01:09:10.978 --> 01:09:13.081
Detective Semler's
in critical condition.

01:09:14.582 --> 01:09:17.452
He's coughing up blood
from internal bleeding.

01:09:17.484 --> 01:09:19.286
They don't know if
they can stop it.

01:09:20.386 --> 01:09:23.524
- Jesus.
- Are you okay?

01:09:24.725 --> 01:09:26.228
I must be coming
down at something.

01:09:28.162 --> 01:09:30.032
Schneider didn't
kill the officers.

01:09:31.363 --> 01:09:33.667
- It was Officer Schiano.
- What?

01:09:33.701 --> 01:09:35.170
He shot his partner first,

01:09:35.203 --> 01:09:38.773
and then the two others before
turning the gun on himself.

01:09:38.805 --> 01:09:40.707
There's no way it
happened that way.

01:09:41.743 --> 01:09:42.577
Yeah.

01:09:43.944 --> 01:09:46.279
What about the woman,
what'd you find on the woman?

01:09:46.314 --> 01:09:50.585
Her name's Vala Schneider,
she's Ansel's wife.

01:09:50.618 --> 01:09:52.487
Where is she now?

01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:55.223
I called the Mercy, but the
ambulance hasn't arrived yet.

01:09:55.256 --> 01:09:57.726
- We'll get an APB out now.
- Yeah.

01:10:08.469 --> 01:10:09.738
No, no,
no, no, no, no, no!

01:10:09.770 --> 01:10:10.905
Deena, it's fine.

01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:24.585
Oh my God, oh my God!

01:10:24.618 --> 01:10:25.853
I don't know where we are,

01:10:25.886 --> 01:10:27.387
but there's an ambulance

01:10:27.421 --> 01:10:28.856
and there's blood
fucking everywhere!

01:10:28.890 --> 01:10:30.091
I think we're
in Orange Grove Drive.

01:10:30.123 --> 01:10:31.859
Orange Grove Drive,
Orange Grove Drive,

01:10:31.893 --> 01:10:33.694
but there's blood everywhere!

01:10:33.728 --> 01:10:37.498
Oh my God!

01:10:45.238 --> 01:10:48.175
Why didn't you tell
me she was your wife?

01:10:48.208 --> 01:10:49.844
It's more
complicated than that.

01:10:49.877 --> 01:10:52.213
Well, maybe this will
give us some answers.

01:10:52.246 --> 01:10:54.149
You don't know
what you're doing, Detective.

01:11:31.886 --> 01:11:34.989
Well, hello everyone,
Faith Daniels here.

01:11:35.021 --> 01:11:37.457
Well, as you can see,
today's a beautiful day

01:11:37.490 --> 01:11:40.028
to mark a new beginning
for our congregation.

01:11:40.060 --> 01:11:42.496
It is our final fundraiser.

01:11:42.529 --> 01:11:45.599
And if all goes
according to plan,

01:11:45.632 --> 01:11:47.969
we'll have nearly
reached our goals

01:11:49.337 --> 01:11:54.075
And well, we've been
through so, so much, and.

01:11:58.779 --> 01:12:00.748
Keep going, Faith,

01:12:00.780 --> 01:12:03.118
- you're doing fine.
- Okay, thank you, Louis.

01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:09.557
Follow me.

01:12:12.426 --> 01:12:15.997
So, as I was saying,
we've been through so much

01:12:16.029 --> 01:12:19.533
in our congregation,
and it warms my heart

01:12:19.567 --> 01:12:21.069
to see everyone pull together

01:12:21.101 --> 01:12:24.572
and helped save this beloved
little chapel of ours.

01:12:26.439 --> 01:12:28.643
This place has a lot of history,

01:12:28.676 --> 01:12:32.747
and I'm really glad that
that we're able not only

01:12:32.779 --> 01:12:37.786
to preserve it, but also
make it, make it stronger.

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:40.788
We couldn't
have done it without you.

01:12:47.895 --> 01:12:50.531
Yeah, totally, we
wouldn't be here right now

01:12:50.564 --> 01:12:53.869
if it wasn't for you, my turn.

01:13:00.006 --> 01:13:02.609
And let's not
forget, we also have

01:13:02.643 --> 01:13:06.713
the hottest God fearing babe.

01:13:06.747 --> 01:13:10.784
Now then, Devin.

01:13:10.818 --> 01:13:12.854
Sorry, Faith, keep going.

01:13:12.886 --> 01:13:14.788
It's okay, Louis,
why don't we check

01:13:14.822 --> 01:13:16.157
in with Minister Malcom?

01:13:22.029 --> 01:13:24.832
No, that sounds really great.

01:13:24.864 --> 01:13:29.570
Yeah, uh-huh, well,
well, thanks so much.

01:13:33.474 --> 01:13:35.877
Okay then, real good.

01:13:37.478 --> 01:13:40.815
Listen, thanks so much
for all your support.

01:13:40.847 --> 01:13:43.518
No, really, it's a
real pleasant surprise.

01:13:43.551 --> 01:13:46.655
It's really gonna put Sunnyside
on much firmer ground.

01:13:47.787 --> 01:13:52.493
Uh-huh, yup, okay,
yeah.

01:13:53.694 --> 01:13:55.263
All right, all right,
all right, yeah, sure.

01:13:55.296 --> 01:13:59.801
Thanks, thanks again,
okay, okay, bye.

01:14:03.436 --> 01:14:06.274
So, what's
the pleasant surprise?

01:14:06.306 --> 01:14:11.313
Well, are you
ready for more good news?

01:14:12.212 --> 01:14:13.380
Yeah, bring it on.

01:14:13.413 --> 01:14:16.016
No, no, no, seriously,
like, are you ready?

01:14:16.050 --> 01:14:20.688
'Cause like really,
really, really ready?

01:14:20.720 --> 01:14:23.625
- Yeah, I'm ready.
- Well I need you to be ready.

01:14:25.126 --> 01:14:27.762
- We're ready.
- We're ready.

01:14:27.795 --> 01:14:29.864
Okay, that was
an anonymous donor

01:14:29.896 --> 01:14:33.934
I just got off the phone
with, a really generous one.

01:14:33.967 --> 01:14:37.005
And they read about the
terrible blasphemous vandalism

01:14:37.037 --> 01:14:38.772
that nearly destroyed us,

01:14:38.805 --> 01:14:40.942
and they read about the fundraiser
efforts that you, Faith,

01:14:40.975 --> 01:14:42.777
started to help keep us alive.

01:14:44.744 --> 01:14:45.747
They wanna help.

01:14:46.913 --> 01:14:49.617
Whoa,
that's incredible.

01:14:49.649 --> 01:14:52.686
We almost reached our goals,
so really every bit counts.

01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:54.622
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's great.

01:14:56.189 --> 01:14:57.625
They wanna match our total.

01:14:59.460 --> 01:15:01.695
What?

01:15:01.729 --> 01:15:03.264
Oh my God, Malcom,
that's incredible!

01:15:03.296 --> 01:15:06.266
- Yeah.
- That's wonderful.

01:15:06.300 --> 01:15:08.936
- What's going on?
- An anonymous donor

01:15:08.969 --> 01:15:13.841
came through, we're going to
exceed our fundraising goal.

01:15:13.873 --> 01:15:18.880
- No way, fucking sweet!
- Ugh, it's sweet indeed,

01:15:20.113 --> 01:15:21.782
Devin, come here, son.

01:15:23.551 --> 01:15:26.287
All right, listen, I want
you to watch your language

01:15:26.319 --> 01:15:27.822
in our house of worship, okay?

01:15:28.922 --> 01:15:31.792
Oh, and be nice Ms. Daniels.

01:15:31.826 --> 01:15:33.528
You know how much
she means to me.

01:15:35.829 --> 01:15:38.198
Sorry, Faith.

01:15:44.337 --> 01:15:46.974
So, Minister Malcom,

01:15:47.006 --> 01:15:49.609
care to recap today's
amazing events?

01:15:49.643 --> 01:15:51.913
Yes, yes, yes, definitely.

01:15:51.945 --> 01:15:54.582
Well, to put it bluntly,
we really did bring it,

01:15:54.614 --> 01:15:57.818
as the kids said, we
raised enough funds

01:15:57.851 --> 01:16:01.922
to finish our repairs and to
add extra security cameras.

01:16:01.956 --> 01:16:04.125
We're going to continue to
protect the congregation

01:16:04.158 --> 01:16:07.395
and ensure that this
never happens again.

01:16:08.828 --> 01:16:11.731
Now, thanks in large part
to the amazing work done

01:16:11.765 --> 01:16:14.735
by Faith Daniels, who helped
mobilize a ground swell

01:16:14.768 --> 01:16:16.604
of support and awareness,

01:16:16.636 --> 01:16:19.306
we continue to receive
love from our Lord.

01:16:20.707 --> 01:16:24.377
Just when we thought things
couldn't get any better,

01:16:24.411 --> 01:16:29.417
we received an
anonymous call, who now,

01:16:31.185 --> 01:16:33.187
stay with me on this,

01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:37.125
he promised that he's
going to match every dollar

01:16:37.158 --> 01:16:39.694
that we've raised already.

01:16:39.726 --> 01:16:42.529
We are truly, truly blessed.

01:16:42.563 --> 01:16:44.532
Amen to that.

01:16:44.564 --> 01:16:47.601
Now, Malcom, if you could
please let the folks

01:16:47.635 --> 01:16:49.270
who couldn't be
here with us today,

01:16:49.302 --> 01:16:54.309
know what this match actually
entails, that would be great.

01:16:55.676 --> 01:16:58.212
Yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely,
this is the best part now.

01:16:58.244 --> 01:16:59.646
Now to receive our donation,

01:17:01.381 --> 01:17:04.085
our donor has asked
us to participate

01:17:04.118 --> 01:17:06.254
in a geo stash game.

01:17:06.287 --> 01:17:07.488
Now, all right, all right,

01:17:07.520 --> 01:17:10.390
I know we're not the
most tech savvy bunch,

01:17:10.423 --> 01:17:12.726
but I think this looks
like a lot of fun.

01:17:12.760 --> 01:17:15.229
Now, basically this is a...

01:17:15.261 --> 01:17:16.697
All right, Faith, help
me out here, what is it?

01:17:16.729 --> 01:17:17.864
Scavenger hunt.

01:17:17.898 --> 01:17:19.600
A scavenger
hunt, right, right.

01:17:19.632 --> 01:17:24.639
But it's done with this little
app that it gives us clues

01:17:25.805 --> 01:17:27.541
and it helps guide
us to our location.

01:17:27.574 --> 01:17:32.246
Now, Faith here has decided
to be our geo stasher.

01:17:32.279 --> 01:17:35.850
- Mm-hmm.
- She has to find five items

01:17:35.882 --> 01:17:40.454
that are stashed nearby and
in fairly close locations.

01:17:42.088 --> 01:17:44.125
- Are you ready, Faith?
- I'm ready.

01:17:44.158 --> 01:17:46.227
Great, let's have a
little prayer, shall we?

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:47.262
Of course.

01:18:04.944 --> 01:18:07.247
Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:09.082
You've changed the
universe forever.

01:18:10.516 --> 01:18:13.987
And Your foot rests on his
back in endless victory.

01:18:15.221 --> 01:18:17.791
Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos

01:18:17.824 --> 01:18:19.493
in eternal celebration.

01:18:21.694 --> 01:18:23.398
On the highest mountain top,

01:18:25.064 --> 01:18:28.535
You reveal Your glory
to those who choose.

01:18:29.837 --> 01:18:31.372
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:18:35.408 --> 01:18:37.110
May the
Lord be with you.

01:18:37.144 --> 01:18:39.614
Thank you, Louis, may
the Lord be with you too.

01:18:41.347 --> 01:18:44.618
Bye Faith,
good luck, see you soon.

01:18:44.652 --> 01:18:46.520
Bye everybody, see you soon.

01:19:14.314 --> 01:19:16.149
And we're off.

01:20:04.264 --> 01:20:07.801
Stairway to heaven,
mm, where are you?

01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:44.806
Oh, what, where?

01:20:45.405 --> 01:20:46.541
I don't get it.

01:20:49.710 --> 01:20:54.716
What, oh my God, really?

01:21:08.929 --> 01:21:10.731
All right, here we go.

01:21:14.902 --> 01:21:19.907
Oh God, I don't like heights.

01:21:30.317 --> 01:21:34.421
Oh, there we go.

01:21:34.454 --> 01:21:38.859
Come with me.

01:21:38.891 --> 01:21:41.496
I can't believe I'm doing this.

01:21:49.970 --> 01:21:51.139
And we're off.

01:21:58.979 --> 01:22:02.182
Okay.

01:22:06.086 --> 01:22:07.221
Oh, all right.

01:22:15.796 --> 01:22:17.632
Let's see what we got here.

01:22:19.832 --> 01:22:24.838
Oh, okay, that's
interesting, what is this?

01:22:30.176 --> 01:22:32.145
One stash, four to go.

01:22:51.965 --> 01:22:55.403
Oh, hold on, okay,
all right, here we go.

01:23:09.750 --> 01:23:12.252
The test that
stumped them all.

01:23:41.782 --> 01:23:44.351
Stumped, I should be.

01:23:52.658 --> 01:23:53.827
What was that?

01:23:56.296 --> 01:24:01.302
Okay okay.

01:24:06.939 --> 01:24:10.176
This is starting to not be
fun anymore, here we go, okay.

01:24:19.953 --> 01:24:21.989
What, but what the heck is this?

01:24:27.994 --> 01:24:29.162
Let's just go.

01:24:40.774 --> 01:24:45.780
Oh, oh, isn't this nice?

01:24:51.385 --> 01:24:54.387
Oh my God, that was
so creepy, okay.

01:24:58.057 --> 01:25:00.161
Geez, what happened here?

01:25:05.097 --> 01:25:07.301
Kids, I guess, I don't know.

01:25:14.841 --> 01:25:17.411
Okay, relax.

01:25:26.853 --> 01:25:28.188
Hey, where have you been?

01:25:28.220 --> 01:25:30.123
I tried calling and texting you.

01:25:30.157 --> 01:25:33.092
I'm walking around these woods.

01:25:33.126 --> 01:25:34.895
I'm so sorry, hon.

01:25:34.927 --> 01:25:37.030
I didn't see your
texts coming until now.

01:25:38.864 --> 01:25:40.466
So, where are you?

01:25:40.500 --> 01:25:44.304
I don't know what,
I have no idea where I am,

01:25:44.337 --> 01:25:46.874
and I think I'm about
to find a third stash,

01:25:46.907 --> 01:25:51.779
but I gotta tell you, this is
officially not fun anymore.

01:25:51.811 --> 01:25:54.448
Oh, cool,
you're on the third stash?

01:25:54.480 --> 01:25:56.516
She found the third
stash, everyone.

01:25:58.051 --> 01:25:58.853
What is it?

01:25:59.953 --> 01:26:04.325
Oh, I'm not sure,
hold on a sec.

01:26:11.564 --> 01:26:13.199
Oh, this is classy.

01:26:13.233 --> 01:26:16.137
Score Magazine, number
one in big boobs.

01:26:23.944 --> 01:26:26.881
Okay, let me see,
oh, I don't know,

01:26:29.082 --> 01:26:30.785
it looks like a
bowl of some sort.

01:26:33.252 --> 01:26:35.755
- Perfect.
- Perfect?

01:26:37.157 --> 01:26:39.927
I'm sorry, Malcom, I think
our friendly little benefactor

01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:41.662
might be just playing
a cool trick on us.

01:26:41.694 --> 01:26:46.666
- Geez, you think?
- Yeah, I'm also cold

01:26:46.699 --> 01:26:48.635
and kinda creeped out right now.

01:26:48.667 --> 01:26:51.137
Can you just come
and pick me up?

01:26:51.171 --> 01:26:53.606
This is over, this is
not going anywhere.

01:26:55.074 --> 01:26:58.244
- Geez, you think?
- I'm sure our little friend

01:26:58.278 --> 01:27:00.914
won't mind.

01:27:00.947 --> 01:27:03.951
Hello, hello?

01:27:06.520 --> 01:27:07.688
Are you there?

01:27:33.412 --> 01:27:36.916
Next clue, to rid
the world of evil,

01:27:36.949 --> 01:27:41.121
you must get to
its root.

01:27:45.292 --> 01:27:50.297
Wait a second, okay, okay,
okay, oh God, all right, relax.

01:27:58.404 --> 01:28:00.340
Okay, it's nothing, oh.

01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:10.683
Okay, oh, come on,
come on, come on.

01:28:17.056 --> 01:28:22.061
There it is.

01:28:29.002 --> 01:28:30.271
Oh, I found it.

01:28:43.550 --> 01:28:48.556
Sweet Jesus, what was that?

01:28:48.822 --> 01:28:49.824
Oh, Lord, oh.

01:28:55.929 --> 01:28:58.065
What was I thinking in
agreeing to do this?

01:28:59.698 --> 01:29:04.170
Oh, damn.

01:29:04.203 --> 01:29:08.474
Oh, my God
I'm outta here.

01:29:16.615 --> 01:29:17.952
Whoa, hey there.

01:29:22.689 --> 01:29:24.992
You should watch where
you're walking, Mister.

01:29:25.958 --> 01:29:28.061
Ugh, what is that?

01:29:33.233 --> 01:29:34.235
Ugh, oh, ew.

01:29:37.270 --> 01:29:38.739
It's just a stupid scarecrow.

01:29:40.306 --> 01:29:45.311
Oh, what?

01:29:47.079 --> 01:29:50.283
I don't know what that is,
but I'm sick of it, okay.

01:30:19.779 --> 01:30:22.616
Nice night for a walk, isn't it?

01:30:23.984 --> 01:30:27.921
Nice, yeah, very nice.

01:30:27.953 --> 01:30:29.622
Probably the best
day of my life.

01:30:38.030 --> 01:30:38.865
All right.

01:31:08.261 --> 01:31:11.531
Finally, you better
be close, Mister.

01:31:11.564 --> 01:31:13.467
That I am,
I think only 15 minutes

01:31:13.500 --> 01:31:14.768
if the navigation is right.

01:31:14.801 --> 01:31:16.636
Sorry, we got cut off before.

01:31:16.668 --> 01:31:18.005
I've got some nice
hot chocolate,

01:31:18.037 --> 01:31:19.772
a few other treats left
over from the bake sale

01:31:19.805 --> 01:31:21.641
for my brave little
scavenger hunter.

01:31:22.742 --> 01:31:23.944
Oh, that's very sweet,

01:31:23.976 --> 01:31:25.545
but won't be enough
to make me forget

01:31:25.578 --> 01:31:28.215
about this freaky night.

01:31:28.247 --> 01:31:31.283
None of these clues
make any sense, Malcom.

01:31:31.317 --> 01:31:35.421
Duly noted, no
more geo stashing in the dark.

01:31:35.454 --> 01:31:36.657
How many did you find?

01:31:38.358 --> 01:31:39.726
Four.

01:31:39.759 --> 01:31:42.229
Ah, so close, well,

01:31:42.261 --> 01:31:44.597
you really did give
it your best shot.

01:31:44.631 --> 01:31:46.300
You were such a great sport.

01:31:47.934 --> 01:31:50.637
What do you mean,
this isn't a prank?

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:52.338
We're not getting the donation?

01:31:52.372 --> 01:31:55.876
Not unless we find
all the stashes, I'm afraid.

01:31:55.908 --> 01:31:58.577
But like I said, A
for effort, my dear.

01:31:58.610 --> 01:32:00.947
Yeah, how about L for loser?

01:32:00.979 --> 01:32:04.317
God, Malcom, this was
such a waste of time.

01:32:04.350 --> 01:32:06.787
I don't wanna let
everybody down.

01:32:06.819 --> 01:32:08.587
Sunnyside really needs
that extra money,

01:32:08.621 --> 01:32:10.123
and you know it.

01:32:10.155 --> 01:32:12.926
Hogwash, Faith
Daniels, you did great.

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:16.496
We'll always be proud of you
for the sacrifice you made.

01:32:16.529 --> 01:32:19.466
Well, I guess, whatever.

01:32:19.498 --> 01:32:22.635
Be there in two
shakes of a lamb's tail.

01:32:22.668 --> 01:32:25.506
Bye.

01:32:42.454 --> 01:32:43.791
Let's do this.

01:32:56.869 --> 01:33:01.207
Find hope between a
rock and a hard place.

01:33:03.510 --> 01:33:07.247
I need some hope.

01:33:08.247 --> 01:33:09.048
There you are.

01:33:15.354 --> 01:33:16.189
Got this.

01:33:23.863 --> 01:33:27.767
If you dig one ditch,
then better dig two,

01:33:27.800 --> 01:33:31.505
'cause the trap you set
just might be for you.

01:33:39.011 --> 01:33:41.347
Okay, let's see.

01:33:48.121 --> 01:33:48.956
What?

01:33:52.859 --> 01:33:55.028
What, who are you?

01:33:55.060 --> 01:33:59.332
Go, stay away from
me, go, what?

01:34:01.367 --> 01:34:06.373
Go away stay
away from me, no.

01:34:07.105 --> 01:34:08.007
What do you want?

01:34:08.041 --> 01:34:11.845
No no, no, get away.

01:35:16.908 --> 01:35:19.746
Welcome to the party, Faith,
so glad you could join us.

01:35:21.213 --> 01:35:24.551
Malcom,
what is this, what?

01:35:25.952 --> 01:35:27.287
Shh, shh, shh.

01:35:30.122 --> 01:35:34.893
What are you doing?

01:35:34.926 --> 01:35:36.697
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

01:35:38.363 --> 01:35:43.369
What, Malcom,
what are you doing?

01:35:55.014 --> 01:35:57.449
Thank you for the
offerings, Faith.

01:35:57.483 --> 01:36:01.688
You did well, I'm sure
he will be most pleased.

01:36:02.954 --> 01:36:07.961
Louis, Malcom, is this a joke?

01:36:09.095 --> 01:36:10.797
- Oh, Faith, shh.
- I'm not comfortable.

01:36:10.829 --> 01:36:14.533
My dear, sweet
Faith, this is no joke.

01:36:15.702 --> 01:36:17.237
You are the sixth stash.

01:36:21.239 --> 01:36:22.708
Hail, Satan.

01:36:22.742 --> 01:36:24.644
Hail, Lucifer.

01:36:24.676 --> 01:36:28.314
What, what, what are
you doing, let me go?

01:36:28.347 --> 01:36:33.353
Shh.

01:36:50.837 --> 01:36:54.641
What, stop.

01:36:57.777 --> 01:37:02.247
Stop, stop, please, stop.

01:37:30.976 --> 01:37:31.811
Why?

01:37:41.921 --> 01:37:46.326
All offerings accounted for,
let the ceremony continue.

01:38:19.992 --> 01:38:24.998
No.

01:38:28.634 --> 01:38:33.140
No.

01:38:36.341 --> 01:38:38.811
Thank
you, Mia, my dear.

01:38:38.845 --> 01:38:41.847
Anything for you,
Minister Malcom.

01:38:51.690 --> 01:38:56.695
What?

01:39:16.314 --> 01:39:17.649
What are you doing?

01:39:17.682 --> 01:39:22.689
No!

01:39:50.983 --> 01:39:52.252
Do I have to?

01:40:08.266 --> 01:40:12.005
He also would drink of the
wine of the wrath of God,

01:40:12.037 --> 01:40:16.509
which is mixed in full strength
in the cup of his anger.

01:40:27.353 --> 01:40:28.521
That's my boy.

01:40:35.161 --> 01:40:37.829
Conqueror of the
assailant of knowledge,

01:40:37.863 --> 01:40:39.798
you've changed the
universe forever,

01:40:40.966 --> 01:40:43.335
and your foot rests
on Jehovah's back

01:40:43.368 --> 01:40:45.304
in endless victory.

01:40:46.404 --> 01:40:48.807
Applause echoes
throughout the cosmos,

01:40:50.275 --> 01:40:55.180
in eternal celebration on
the highest mountain top,

01:40:56.381 --> 01:40:59.351
you reveal your glory
to those who choose.

01:40:59.385 --> 01:41:03.523
What's that?

01:41:07.792 --> 01:41:09.662
My Lord, is that you?

01:41:11.764 --> 01:41:16.670
Have you come for us, my Lord?

01:41:18.104 --> 01:41:19.940
What's this, what's this
horrible smell?

01:41:22.675 --> 01:41:25.378
Malcom, don't do
that, don't do that.

01:41:25.411 --> 01:41:29.248
Don't do that, Malcom.

01:41:33.685 --> 01:41:38.657
Holy shit, oh
my God, oh, oh!

01:42:27.640 --> 01:42:29.909
Mount Olive, Mount Olive?

01:42:37.582 --> 01:42:40.652
Yeah, Dale, listen, it's Frank.

01:42:40.685 --> 01:42:42.421
I just watched a
video I think was shot

01:42:42.454 --> 01:42:43.689
in your neck of the woods.

01:42:43.722 --> 01:42:45.658
It's a church right
outside Mount Olive.

01:42:45.690 --> 01:42:47.426
Do you know the one
I'm talking about?

01:42:48.293 --> 01:42:49.962
Right, just off the interstate.

01:42:51.229 --> 01:42:53.131
Your guys were just there?

01:42:53.164 --> 01:42:55.001
I'll be damned, when
did that happen?

01:42:57.103 --> 01:42:59.971
Well, the video shows
Satanists sacrificing a woman,

01:43:00.005 --> 01:43:00.974
for Christ's sake.

01:43:03.442 --> 01:43:05.478
You're telling me that
actually happened?

01:43:06.412 --> 01:43:07.947
Jesus, that's unbelievable.

01:43:09.547 --> 01:43:12.152
Yeah, we'll get a copy of
the video right out to you.

01:43:13.586 --> 01:43:16.489
Yeah, no shit, Dale, that's
one for the books, thanks.

01:43:25.898 --> 01:43:29.903
There's a whole lot going
on out at Mount Olive.

01:43:33.104 --> 01:43:35.707
What else do you know
about that church?

01:43:35.740 --> 01:43:37.577
A lot more than
what's on that video.

01:43:38.409 --> 01:43:39.845
Well, it burned
to the ground last night.

01:43:41.346 --> 01:43:42.514
Dispatch received a call

01:43:42.547 --> 01:43:43.983
from a woman saying
she found the ambulance

01:43:44.015 --> 01:43:45.384
out on Orange Brook Drive.

01:43:48.487 --> 01:43:49.456
Is everything okay?

01:43:51.256 --> 01:43:53.025
It's
gotta be the drives.

01:43:54.960 --> 01:43:56.095
It's gotta be the drive.

01:43:56.127 --> 01:43:57.362
I don't know how,

01:43:57.395 --> 01:43:59.631
but somehow Schneider
put something in them.

01:44:05.404 --> 01:44:08.441
Damned, busting me for
smiling on a cloudy day.

01:44:08.474 --> 01:44:09.842
Am I under arrest here or what?

01:44:09.875 --> 01:44:11.344
Hey, you have a seat.

01:44:11.377 --> 01:44:12.845
Yeah, you haven't even
read me my fucking rights.

01:44:12.877 --> 01:44:14.579
Go take a seat.

01:44:14.613 --> 01:44:16.082
- Hi.
- Oh, hi.

01:44:16.114 --> 01:44:17.716
Did you
hear me, go take a seat?

01:44:17.750 --> 01:44:19.586
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

01:44:23.255 --> 01:44:25.091
That's some nice
stuff you've got.

01:44:25.123 --> 01:44:26.925
I'd love to try it on.

01:44:28.527 --> 01:44:32.832
Please, you wanna
cuff me, officer?

01:44:32.864 --> 01:44:34.867
Yes, you'd probably
enjoy it too much.

01:44:36.100 --> 01:44:37.369
Would you take a seat, please?

01:44:39.838 --> 01:44:43.009
Seriously dude, time is
money and the rent is due.

01:44:43.042 --> 01:44:44.978
And I'll tell you
when you can leave.

01:45:02.461 --> 01:45:04.463
What's the story
with these guys?

01:45:05.997 --> 01:45:08.333
We found them standing in
the middle of the street,

01:45:08.367 --> 01:45:09.936
right outside the precinct.

01:45:09.969 --> 01:45:11.971
Yeah, one of 'em
had ID, so we ran it.

01:45:12.003 --> 01:45:15.173
It turns out these three
went missing three hours away

01:45:15.207 --> 01:45:16.576
in Jersey last week.

01:45:16.609 --> 01:45:18.077
What are they doing here?

01:45:18.109 --> 01:45:20.179
Hey, your guess
is as good as ours.

01:45:21.447 --> 01:45:23.048
It killed my dad.

01:45:24.649 --> 01:45:25.984
What's he saying?

01:45:26.018 --> 01:45:27.653
It's in the church.

01:45:27.685 --> 01:45:28.987
It's in the church.

01:45:29.020 --> 01:45:31.289
Look Sarge, there's
been some crazy shit

01:45:31.323 --> 01:45:32.458
going on out there.

01:45:32.490 --> 01:45:34.092
You have someone
coming down from Jersey

01:45:34.126 --> 01:45:35.828
to pick these guys up.

01:45:35.860 --> 01:45:38.698
That's the
best news I heard all night.

01:45:38.730 --> 01:45:42.400
You need to send
someone to the church.

01:45:42.434 --> 01:45:44.003
We're working on it.

01:45:44.036 --> 01:45:45.503
Sergeant Biehn, do me a favor

01:45:45.537 --> 01:45:46.939
and give these guys
a seat, all right?

01:45:46.971 --> 01:45:49.442
Over to your
left, to your left.

01:45:59.618 --> 01:46:00.854
Is everything okay?

01:46:04.789 --> 01:46:06.859
I need to see Ansel Schneider.

01:46:06.891 --> 01:46:08.327
He's
not here right now.

01:46:09.461 --> 01:46:10.829
It's important.

01:46:10.863 --> 01:46:13.132
There's nothing I
can do about that.

01:46:13.164 --> 01:46:14.266
Come on, I can help you out.

01:46:29.914 --> 01:46:31.884
Garcia, get the generators on.

01:46:31.917 --> 01:46:32.752
Yes, sir.

01:46:38.524 --> 01:46:43.529
Oh my God.

01:46:44.896 --> 01:46:47.934
Fuck, shit, holy fuck!

01:46:47.966 --> 01:46:49.969
Do I need a bust out
of the station now?

01:46:50.002 --> 01:46:52.305
What the hell,
what's going here?

01:46:52.337 --> 01:46:54.306
He said something on the
flash drives caused this.

01:46:54.340 --> 01:46:56.242
- What?
- I don't know.

01:46:57.542 --> 01:46:58.944
Where's that coming from?

01:46:58.978 --> 01:47:00.613
Sounds
like the front desk.

01:47:00.645 --> 01:47:02.113
Who's down there?

01:47:02.146 --> 01:47:04.684
I
don't know, Howard?

01:47:04.716 --> 01:47:05.518
Get Armitage to the ambulance.

01:47:07.886 --> 01:47:10.389
Stop please!

01:47:10.421 --> 01:47:13.326
We have to help him.

01:47:13.359 --> 01:47:15.528
I'll handle the suspect.

01:47:20.733 --> 01:47:22.268
Freeze!

01:47:25.037 --> 01:47:25.872
Stop!

01:47:28.239 --> 01:47:29.908
The
whole precinct's under attack!

01:47:29.942 --> 01:47:32.110
Whatever you do,
don't go near it!

01:47:38.149 --> 01:47:38.984
Shit.

01:47:50.328 --> 01:47:51.130
Vala, stop!

01:47:55.266 --> 01:47:57.635
You used me, but
this has to end.

01:48:01.407 --> 01:48:03.775
It's already spreading.

01:48:03.809 --> 01:48:06.679
The audience was the
target all along.

01:48:06.712 --> 01:48:08.981
And you lead them to me.

01:48:09.014 --> 01:48:11.317
This isn't a fucking movie.

01:48:11.350 --> 01:48:14.487
You don't have to
believe, see for yourself.

01:48:21.627 --> 01:48:26.365
They're watching
this now.
