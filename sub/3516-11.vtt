01:33.680 --> 01:35.682
<i>This is Russo.
Please leave a message.</i>

01:35.800 --> 01:37.450
He's not
answering my calls.

01:37.520 --> 01:39.761
It's over,
and he must know it.

01:39.840 --> 01:43.049
You don't think there's
any way he can recover?

01:43.120 --> 01:44.610
The Republicans will
play that interview

01:44.720 --> 01:46.245
on every radio
and television station

01:46.320 --> 01:49.369
from now until
November 5th.

01:49.440 --> 01:52.330
I sympathize with the kid, but this
was my concern from the beginning.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.801
And I should've
listened to you, sir.

01:54.880 --> 01:57.360
I thought he could
handle the pressure.

01:57.480 --> 02:01.041
Okay. So he withdraws.
We need to replace him.

02:01.120 --> 02:03.361
You have any ideas?

02:03.440 --> 02:05.841
With less than
two months to go?

02:07.320 --> 02:09.368
If the President hadn't shut me
out of the early discussions,

02:09.479 --> 02:11.642
I could've come up
with some good options,

02:11.720 --> 02:12.960
but I don't know
anyone who's got

02:13.080 --> 02:14.411
the name recognition
and donor base

02:14.480 --> 02:18.963
to start a campaign from
scratch just seven weeks out.

02:19.040 --> 02:21.281
Let me think.

02:22.760 --> 02:25.764
Everything hinges on
the next few minutes.

02:25.840 --> 02:29.322
All my months of planning,
every move I've made.

02:32.280 --> 02:33.725
There is one person.

02:33.880 --> 02:35.291
Who?

02:37.960 --> 02:39.200
You, Mr. Vice President.

02:41.400 --> 02:43.243
If you ran to
reclaim your seat,

02:43.400 --> 02:45.289
I think you'd
win by a landslide.

02:45.360 --> 02:46.930
Resign the Vice Presidency?

02:47.000 --> 02:49.321
Only if you win.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.243
Walker needs me for 2016.

02:52.960 --> 02:55.770
Are you entirely certain he's
gonna keep you on the ticket?

02:55.840 --> 02:58.446
I mean, it's no secret

02:58.520 --> 03:01.205
the two of you
don't exactly get along.

03:02.040 --> 03:03.724
What has he said?

03:06.240 --> 03:09.369
Oh, you're putting me in a very
awkward position, Mr. Vice President.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.011
Has he been
bad-mouthing me?

03:12.080 --> 03:16.404
Well, the exact phrase he
used was "pain in the ass."

03:22.200 --> 03:23.281
That fucker.

03:23.560 --> 03:26.723
He's got no idea how to
lead, no sense of respect.

03:28.680 --> 03:30.045
Is this his idea?
No.

03:30.120 --> 03:31.167
His way of
getting rid of me?

03:31.280 --> 03:32.361
No. it struck me
yesterday,

03:32.480 --> 03:34.084
and I just thought it
was worth suggesting.

03:34.160 --> 03:35.889
But, no, I haven't
discussed this with anyone.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.041
And you shouldn't.

03:37.120 --> 03:40.567
People don't leave the White
House to become a governor.

03:43.960 --> 03:46.327
May I ask you
a personal question, sir?

03:46.720 --> 03:48.802
Do you want to be
the Vice President?

03:50.000 --> 03:52.731
Peter said that when you were
out on that campaign trail,

03:52.800 --> 03:55.326
you had so much
enthusiasm and energy

03:55.400 --> 03:59.769
that he thought you maybe
missed being the Governor.

04:02.480 --> 04:03.606
I do miss it.

04:03.720 --> 04:06.007
Then why not go back?

04:06.520 --> 04:08.329
You could be the hero
of this election

04:08.960 --> 04:12.726
and secure Pennsylvania
for the Democrats in 2016.

04:14.000 --> 04:17.163
Garrett would never go along
with something like this,

04:17.240 --> 04:18.480
even if he hates my guts.

04:18.839 --> 04:23.209
It would make him look weak, like he's
lost control of the administration.

04:23.280 --> 04:25.601
Not if it was
a mutual decision.

04:26.840 --> 04:31.243
Look, let me talk to Garrett. I
won't mention that we've spoken.

04:33.600 --> 04:36.444
I suppose there's no harm in
finding out what he thinks.

04:37.080 --> 04:39.651
Thank you,
Mr. Vice President.

04:43.200 --> 04:44.690
<i>Slogans for $400.</i>

04:44.760 --> 04:46.728
<i>1976. "He's making us proud again."</i>

04:47.440 --> 04:49.204
<i>A.J.
Who is Carter?</i>

04:49.280 --> 04:51.567
<i>No. John?
Who's Ford?</i>

04:51.640 --> 04:53.210
Peter?

04:53.280 --> 04:54.691
<i>Slogans for $600.</i>

04:54.800 --> 04:58.407
<i>Peter, are you here'? TREBEK".
"Grandfather's hat fits Ben."</i>

04:58.840 --> 05:00.808
<i>Claudia.
Who is Benjamin Harrison?</i>

05:00.880 --> 05:02.211
<i>Yes.</i>

05:02.400 --> 05:03.765
<i>Presidential Slogans
for $800.</i>

05:03.840 --> 05:05.365
<i>TREBEK: 1900.
"The full dinner pail."</i>

05:05.440 --> 05:06.441
On the train ride down,

05:06.520 --> 05:08.170
I almost called the police
to have them break in

05:08.240 --> 05:10.846
and make sure you
hadn't hurt yourself.

05:11.360 --> 05:15.081
I'm not even gonna ask you what happened.
It doesn't matter right now.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.322
What matters right now...

05:18.400 --> 05:20.289
What matters...
Who is Goldwater?

05:22.240 --> 05:23.605
- <i>Claudia.
Who is Goldwater?</i>

05:23.760 --> 05:24.761
Barry Goldwater. Yes.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.925
<i>Cuts Like a Knife
for $800.</i>

05:27.040 --> 05:28.485
<i>The official
instrument...</i>

05:28.560 --> 05:30.688
Oh, come on.
Hey, I'm watching that.

05:34.920 --> 05:37.969
What matters is the 50 reporters
in front of your building

05:38.080 --> 05:41.448
and the 150 campaign staffers who
don't know if they still have a job.

05:41.800 --> 05:43.131
It's over.

05:44.920 --> 05:47.002
I know.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.606
So, tell them to go away.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.370
What, are you just gonna
hole yourself up in here

06:05.440 --> 06:06.407
and hope it all goes away?

06:06.480 --> 06:08.050
Yeah, that's pretty much
the plan.

06:08.120 --> 06:09.360
Well, I won't let you.

06:10.760 --> 06:12.967
Hey, put that down. Hey.

06:14.280 --> 06:15.611
Hey, put that down!

06:15.720 --> 06:16.960
Peter...

06:32.240 --> 06:34.971
We need to put out
a statement.

06:35.520 --> 06:37.249
Call me when you're
prepared to do that.

06:39.640 --> 06:42.610
I'll be at
the headquarters in Philly.

06:47.120 --> 06:50.886
I was scared that I was
starting to feel too much for you.

06:53.160 --> 06:56.050
I think,
that's why I ended it.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.043
And you have
no room for fear?

06:58.120 --> 07:00.930
No. Being afraid doesn't
accomplish anything.

07:01.000 --> 07:03.446
It's not true.
When I'm overseas,

07:03.560 --> 07:05.961
rational fear of
disease or violence,

07:06.040 --> 07:08.566
that sort of fear
keeps you alive.

07:08.640 --> 07:13.521
Back here, God, I find
myself afraid of things

07:13.600 --> 07:17.127
that I can't name
or point to.

07:17.200 --> 07:20.807
It's like,
how little am I seeing?

07:20.880 --> 07:24.441
Or have I wasted
this day or this moment?

07:24.680 --> 07:28.446
Yeah, I think that sometimes,
whether my life will add up.

07:32.360 --> 07:36.206
Francis would roll his eyes if
he heard me talking like this.

07:38.760 --> 07:40.888
Does he know
where you are?

07:42.240 --> 07:44.322
No, he doesn't.

07:54.480 --> 07:57.211
If he's looking for you,
that's where you are.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.327
Over there.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.808
Before you met Frank.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.810
Alone.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.809
Curious.

08:05.920 --> 08:08.287
Absorbing everything.

08:08.360 --> 08:11.762
You have no idea what I was
like when I was a girl.

08:13.880 --> 08:16.121
Did he ever know
that side of you?

08:18.320 --> 08:21.403
He wasn't interested
in that girl.

08:21.560 --> 08:22.561
And neither was I.

08:23.760 --> 08:24.841
What were you
interested in?

08:25.440 --> 08:27.727
Being more
than an observer.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.770
You wanted to be seen.

08:30.520 --> 08:32.284
Not just seen.

08:32.360 --> 08:35.364
I wanted to be significant.

08:42.640 --> 08:43.846
There's no
historical precedent.

08:44.600 --> 08:47.001
Aaron Burr ran for governor,
Calhoun for the Senate.

08:47.080 --> 08:49.321
Two hundred years ago.
One shot a man in a duel,

08:49.400 --> 08:50.811
the other believed
in slavery.

08:50.880 --> 08:53.042
Is that really the sort of
company we want to share, Frank?

08:53.120 --> 08:56.363
Mr. President, we stand losing
control of an important swing state,

08:56.440 --> 08:57.805
our majority in the House,

08:57.880 --> 08:59.928
and quite possibly your
second term in office.

09:00.280 --> 09:03.124
Preventing all of that may
require unconventional measures.

09:03.200 --> 09:04.281
It would look like
I'm pushing him out.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.970
Or worse, that he's abandoning
the administration.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.204
You make a joint statement.

09:11.320 --> 09:13.607
You say he won't
resign unless he wins.

09:14.120 --> 09:16.771
If he loses, he stays
on as Vice President.

09:16.840 --> 09:20.287
No one could accuse either of
you of disloyalty to the other.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.646
Did Jim come
to you with this?

09:21.760 --> 09:23.091
No. It's entirely
my idea.

09:23.160 --> 09:24.650
I wouldn't dream of speaking
to the Vice President

09:24.760 --> 09:26.250
without passing it
by you first.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.129
I think he'd take
it as an affront,

09:28.480 --> 09:29.766
like I'm trying
to get rid of him.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.484
Honestly, sir,
I think he might be

09:31.640 --> 09:33.290
more interested
than you imagine.

09:34.120 --> 09:35.326
Why is that?

09:35.440 --> 09:36.601
Well, I hesitate
to bring this up,

09:36.720 --> 09:40.008
but when he was
campaigning for Russo,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.328
he spoke quite
freely about you, sir.

09:47.840 --> 09:49.922
Tell me.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.843
Of course, I'm getting
this secondhand from Peter,

09:51.920 --> 09:52.967
but the gist of it
is that...

09:54.080 --> 09:56.367
That you lack
entirely in leadership,

09:56.800 --> 09:59.804
and that you have
no sense of respect.

09:59.880 --> 10:01.530
And he wants
more responsibility?

10:02.200 --> 10:04.089
And how do I give him
that when he shows

10:04.200 --> 10:06.123
absolutely no discretion,
no discipline?

10:06.200 --> 10:08.202
Well, that is entirely my point.
Now, look,

10:08.360 --> 10:10.408
I take full responsibility
for backing Russo,

10:10.480 --> 10:13.086
but there could be
a silver lining in all this.

10:13.160 --> 10:14.969
You could
accomplish two goals.

10:15.040 --> 10:17.202
Secure Pennsylvania
for the Democrats

10:17.600 --> 10:20.843
and find an honorable way
to replace Matthews.

10:21.360 --> 10:22.361
What do you think?

10:24.040 --> 10:25.804
I think it is
a very big decision,

10:25.920 --> 10:27.729
and we do not want to
make it impulsively.

10:27.800 --> 10:30.201
I agree. I'd like to put
some more thought into it.

10:30.280 --> 10:32.203
Well, that is very prudent, sir.
Just bear in mind,

10:32.360 --> 10:34.442
seven weeks out,
that every day counts.

10:48.200 --> 10:49.201
Hi, sir.

10:49.320 --> 10:50.321
How much is it?

10:50.400 --> 10:53.006
Oh, I got your
receipt right here.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.965
No, no,no.
It was just $40.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.882
Yeah. Don't tell
anyone, all right?

11:05.400 --> 11:07.801
No.I never say
anything about our tenants.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.524
The press still outside?
Yeah.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.568
I told them you weren't
here, like you said.

11:13.640 --> 11:16.530
Most of them left.
There's still a few, though.

11:16.600 --> 11:17.886
If I wanted to leave,
is there a place

11:17.960 --> 11:19.325
I could do it
without being seen?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.602
Yeah. The freight elevator
down to the garage.

11:22.200 --> 11:23.725
I could call you
a cab or...

11:23.840 --> 11:25.444
All right. Thanks.
I'll let you know.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.642
Mr. Russo...

11:27.720 --> 11:30.963
Sir, it's none
of my business,

11:31.040 --> 11:33.202
but my uncle, he fell off
the wagon a few times.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.931
When he did, the best thing for
him was just not to be alone.

11:36.040 --> 11:38.327
I'll give you this money back,
I'll take that bag off your hands,

11:38.600 --> 11:40.011
come in here,
keep you company...

11:40.120 --> 11:42.771
I appreciate it. I'll let you
know if I change my mind.

13:35.240 --> 13:37.322
Sit down.

13:40.120 --> 13:41.326
Where's Claire?

13:42.160 --> 13:43.571
Not here.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.970
So what is this,
tying up loose ends?

13:48.840 --> 13:52.845
I wouldn't presume. People like
you can't be neatly tied up.

13:52.920 --> 13:54.922
But I thought
perhaps we could start...

14:26.120 --> 14:28.600
It's very tasteful.

15:06.480 --> 15:09.404
This is the dress
she wore to the gala.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.244
I believe so.

15:11.320 --> 15:13.129
It is.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.768
I recognize it.

15:22.160 --> 15:23.321
Go back
into the bedroom.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.848
I'm amazed how well
you got her in focus.

15:54.520 --> 15:55.521
What should we call her?

15:57.640 --> 15:58.641
Why does she
need a name?

15:59.840 --> 16:02.810
I never photograph anyone
without knowing their name.

16:02.880 --> 16:05.724
You didn't take
the photograph. I did.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.722
I think we should
call her Claire.

16:13.120 --> 16:14.963
She doesn't even
look like me.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.281
Not even a younger version.
Why do you keep saying that?

16:17.360 --> 16:20.284
Not her features,
her expression.

16:20.360 --> 16:23.204
Hey, we should mount it. You
can hang her in your house.

16:23.280 --> 16:25.567
Would Francis object?

16:28.080 --> 16:31.129
Can we please not
discuss Francis?

16:31.560 --> 16:32.846
You brought him up
in the park.

16:32.920 --> 16:35.002
I know I did,
and I shouldn't have.

16:35.080 --> 16:37.765
So we have to pretend
he doesn't exist?

16:46.440 --> 16:49.842
I thought we could
talk about anything.

16:50.440 --> 16:53.330
He is a presence here.
You must admit that.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.207
When you walked
through the door yesterday,

16:56.280 --> 16:58.806
he walked right in
with you.

16:59.720 --> 17:02.200
It's just me,
nobody else.

17:02.280 --> 17:05.522
You keep telling yourself
that, it might come true.

17:10.800 --> 17:13.963
How do you think she'd feel if
she knew I was wearing this?

17:14.079 --> 17:16.242
I don't know.

17:17.960 --> 17:20.804
You don't think
she'd be upset?

17:21.160 --> 17:24.960
She'd probably say you
look very beautiful in it.

17:26.280 --> 17:28.487
It's like steel.

17:30.640 --> 17:32.529
You should put it back.

17:36.960 --> 17:38.644
I think I'll keep it.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.883
I'll buy you one of
your own, if you'd like.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.606
No. I want this one.

17:45.680 --> 17:49.446
She came into my bedroom. She
should know I came into hers.

17:55.200 --> 17:57.931
Is your bed always
so perfectly made?

17:58.000 --> 18:00.048
It's a habit I formed
at military school.

18:01.240 --> 18:04.403
What side of the bed
does she sleep on?

18:06.200 --> 18:07.804
That side.

18:27.000 --> 18:29.287
She can keep it.

18:30.000 --> 18:32.048
Fits her better anyway.

19:16.640 --> 19:18.768
Listen, Zoe...

19:20.040 --> 19:22.122
Whatever just
happened upstairs,

19:22.240 --> 19:24.368
whatever these past
six months have been,

19:24.440 --> 19:28.001
can we agree that it
is time to simplify?

19:28.720 --> 19:30.324
What does simple
look like?

19:31.280 --> 19:33.931
We maintain our
professional arrangement,

19:34.000 --> 19:37.288
as you suggested,
which I will honor.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.485
You still trust me?

19:41.920 --> 19:44.127
What choice do I have?

19:44.840 --> 19:49.243
You didn't hurt me or discard
me like you said you would.

19:54.640 --> 19:57.610
I'm glad I didn't have to.

19:59.040 --> 20:02.442
Yes, we'll agree
to simplify.

20:03.840 --> 20:05.649
Good.

20:26.640 --> 20:28.688
<i>Sorry I'm</i> a <i>few
minutes late, Frank.</i>

20:34.040 --> 20:36.964
Please, have a seat.

20:40.400 --> 20:43.165
I have a pretty good idea why
you asked for this meeting.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.844
Have you and the President
had a chance to speak?

20:44.920 --> 20:46.410
We have.

20:46.480 --> 20:48.244
Is he leaning
one way or another?

20:48.320 --> 20:49.446
He's torn.

20:51.520 --> 20:53.409
And what about you?
I'm a little less torn.

20:53.520 --> 20:56.091
My instincts tell me
it's a mistake.

20:56.880 --> 20:58.291
You want to
convince me otherwise?

20:58.400 --> 21:00.164
Well, look,
if your instincts tell you

21:00.320 --> 21:01.685
this is not the way to go,
I'm not about to...

21:01.760 --> 21:04.081
Frank, I'm gonna ask you
two very direct questions,

21:04.200 --> 21:06.521
and I would appreciate
direct answers.

21:06.880 --> 21:08.928
When you got
my son into college,

21:09.000 --> 21:11.048
were you anticipating
a moment like this?

21:13.360 --> 21:14.361
I don't follow.

21:16.360 --> 21:17.521
Honestly, Frank?

21:18.160 --> 21:19.969
Was I antici...

21:20.920 --> 21:23.400
I would be happy to answer you directly
if I knew what you were asking.

21:23.480 --> 21:27.087
All right. I will ask
you my second question.

21:28.520 --> 21:31.729
Do you want the Vice
Presidency for yourself?

21:33.040 --> 21:35.168
I would serve at the pleasure of the President.
If that was his...

21:35.240 --> 21:38.767
You proposed this idea so that
you can take Matthews' place.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.723
I did not say that. But
it is what you want.

21:41.440 --> 21:42.646
What I want is in the...

21:42.760 --> 21:43.966
The President
makes you VP,

21:44.040 --> 21:45.883
he keeps you on
the ticket in 2016,

21:45.960 --> 21:48.361
and you use that as a
springboard to run in 2020.

21:48.560 --> 21:51.609
Tell me that trajectory
has never entered your mind.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.884
Well, Linda,
I make a habit of

21:55.000 --> 21:57.401
considering all trajectories
in any given situation.

21:57.480 --> 22:00.927
But that's a practical
exercise, not a personal one.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.166
So you refuse
to admit it.

22:03.240 --> 22:05.163
Admit it's what I want?
That's irrelevant.

22:05.240 --> 22:07.242
You're the one who asked
for this meeting, not me.

22:07.320 --> 22:09.163
This meeting's about
trying to solve a problem,

22:09.240 --> 22:11.322
not fulfill some
personal ambition.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.961
But if both could be achieved,
you wouldn't object.

22:16.760 --> 22:18.683
I think this is
a sound course of action

22:18.760 --> 22:22.207
regardless of who the President
taps to replace Matthews.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.887
I must gamble
everything I have right now.

22:26.960 --> 22:28.530
If I'm honest,
she may use it against me.

22:28.600 --> 22:31.683
If I'm not,
she won't lift a finger.

22:31.760 --> 22:33.888
I've used this
same tactic myself.

22:34.600 --> 22:38.446
Once someone is exposed,
they're at your mercy.

22:38.960 --> 22:43.443
She wants to hear me
say the words.

22:46.120 --> 22:47.929
Yes.

22:48.960 --> 22:51.964
I want to be
the Vice President.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.731
And, yes, I helped
your son get into college

22:56.840 --> 22:59.571
in the hopes that you
would return the favor.

22:59.720 --> 23:02.644
But I can't force
you to do so, Linda.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.610
But I also think that we would
make a formidable team.

23:13.640 --> 23:14.880
Look what we've
been able to accomplish

23:14.960 --> 23:17.770
even when we've been
at odds with each other.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.561
Now put your mind to what we
could accomplish if we weren't.

23:24.880 --> 23:27.531
Thank you for
taking the time, Linda.

23:34.320 --> 23:36.561
I'll call you back.
How'd it go?

23:36.640 --> 23:38.961
She's holding her cards
very close to the chest.

23:39.040 --> 23:41.441
Any word from Peter?
Nothing.

23:41.520 --> 23:42.851
Christina said he wouldn't
leave the apartment.

23:42.920 --> 23:45.082
But I called the doorman, and
he said that Peter was gone.

23:45.160 --> 23:46.685
Where?
He doesn't know.

23:46.760 --> 23:49.411
He needs to officially withdraw
to put pressure on Walker.

23:49.480 --> 23:50.766
I'm trying
to track him down.

23:50.840 --> 23:52.444
Why'd you let him out of your
sight in the first place?

23:52.520 --> 23:53.646
I thought he
was showering.

23:53.720 --> 23:55.006
He disappeared when I was
on the phone with you.

23:55.240 --> 23:58.483
There was a plan here, Doug.
He explodes, he withdraws,

23:58.560 --> 24:01.803
we put him back together,
and he quietly goes away.

24:02.040 --> 24:04.008
<i>Russo has made no
public appearances</i>

24:04.120 --> 24:06.122
<i>since allegations
that he was inebriated</i>

24:06.200 --> 24:10.410
<i>during a radio interview on WZPZ
Pittsburgh yesterday morning.</i>

24:10.480 --> 24:13.131
<i>Sources among the Democratic
leadership have suggested</i>

24:13.200 --> 24:16.602
<i>that the party is currently
considering options to replace Russo.</i>

24:16.680 --> 24:19.604
<i>Meanwhile, Republican candidate
Jack Swofford's lead</i>

24:19.680 --> 24:21.808
<i>has jumped to</i>
a <i>24-point margin,</i>

24:21.880 --> 24:24.565
<i>according to an overnight
CNN poll of registered voters.</i>

24:24.640 --> 24:26.642
<i>The Swofford campaign
is also reporting</i>

24:26.760 --> 24:28.762
a <i>sharp spike
in contributions.</i>

24:28.840 --> 24:31.571
<i>Nearly $500,000
in the last 20...</i>

24:36.800 --> 24:38.768
I saw that this morning.

24:39.560 --> 24:42.689
Francis got Peter to run.

24:44.040 --> 24:45.326
Do you know him well?

24:45.400 --> 24:46.765
We weren't close.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.168
Do you need to make calls? 'Cause
I can head into the other room.

24:59.240 --> 25:01.766
I don't think so. Thanks.

25:22.200 --> 25:23.281
Where are you going?

25:23.440 --> 25:25.966
To the lab.
I should've gone in today.

25:27.880 --> 25:28.881
Adam.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.923
Adam...
Just go. Go. Leave.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.162
How long do you think this
can possibly go on for?

25:34.240 --> 25:36.242
We have never spent more
than 48 hours together.

25:36.320 --> 25:38.721
Maybe there's
a reason for that.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.209
A part of me
still loves you.

25:42.280 --> 25:43.805
Which part?

25:48.600 --> 25:51.843
I can't be just
a pit stop, Claire,

25:51.960 --> 25:54.247
or some sort of escape... Oh, come on.
You're more than that.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.129
Or a top-up on whatever
Francis can't provide.

25:56.280 --> 25:59.409
Oh, fuck off!
He's my husband, Adam.

25:59.680 --> 26:02.160
We've gone through more
than you could ever imagine.

26:02.240 --> 26:04.049
I envy your free spirit,
and I'm attracted to it,

26:04.160 --> 26:06.003
but not all of us
have that luxury.

26:06.080 --> 26:09.562
Which is what I find so
frustrating about you, Claire.

26:09.640 --> 26:12.291
You had a choice.

26:12.360 --> 26:14.203
You chose
not to be free.

26:14.280 --> 26:17.090
No. What I chose was a man I
could love for more than a week.

26:22.520 --> 26:25.046
I shouldn't have
said that. I...

26:25.120 --> 26:27.930
At least you're
being honest.

26:28.000 --> 26:31.891
I can't live moment to
moment like you, Adam.

26:31.960 --> 26:35.851
I have a history with Francis,
I have a future with him,

26:35.920 --> 26:38.685
and it's bigger
than a moment.

26:40.280 --> 26:41.770
Then you should kill it.

26:42.480 --> 26:45.086
Whatever part of
you still loves me.

26:47.280 --> 26:48.691
If you can't,

26:50.120 --> 26:52.168
I will.

26:55.280 --> 26:57.760
Adam...
No.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.924
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey. Hey, sweetie.

27:30.200 --> 27:33.329
How's it going?
Are you with your mom?

27:33.400 --> 27:35.562
<i>She's downstairs.
You want me to go get her?</i>

27:35.640 --> 27:39.440
No. No. I just wanted
to call and say,

27:41.920 --> 27:45.163
you know,
hey to your brother and you.

27:45.240 --> 27:46.571
Is he there?

27:46.640 --> 27:50.247
<i>He's in his room, I think.</i>

27:50.400 --> 27:52.289
Okay. You want to
go get him?

27:52.360 --> 27:53.441
<i>Hold on.</i>

28:05.960 --> 28:08.884
<i>He says he doesn't
want to talk to you.</i>

28:11.600 --> 28:12.761
Why not?

28:12.920 --> 28:14.046
<i>We've seen the news, Dad.</i>

28:14.960 --> 28:17.850
<i>There were all sorts of TV
cameras at our school yesterday.</i>

28:19.000 --> 28:22.163
<i>Mom's making us
stay home this week.</i>

28:27.440 --> 28:30.683
I want you to do something.
I want you to go to

28:30.760 --> 28:34.003
your bedroom
window and look out.

28:35.800 --> 28:37.882
You see that black car?

28:38.360 --> 28:39.521
<i>Yeah.</i>

28:39.640 --> 28:40.801
That's me.

28:40.880 --> 28:44.521
<i>You shouldn't be here, Dad.
Mom would be really angry.</i>

28:44.640 --> 28:48.850
Well, we don't need
to tell her. Right?

28:49.840 --> 28:51.922
It'll just be...
It'll just be...

28:52.520 --> 28:54.921
It'll just be
our little secret.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.527
<i>Your voice sounds weird,
like it did on the radio.</i>

29:02.240 --> 29:04.242
You heard that?

29:04.320 --> 29:06.561
<i>I have a computer.</i>

29:09.200 --> 29:11.009
I'm sorry.

29:14.800 --> 29:17.087
Sometimes your dad
makes mistakes.

29:17.160 --> 29:18.889
<i>I better go.
No.</i>

29:18.960 --> 29:21.691
<i>I don't like to hear your
voice when it's like this.</i>

29:21.880 --> 29:24.611
<i>It makes me sad.
Bye, Dad.</i>

29:24.680 --> 29:26.808
Sarah, please...

29:52.720 --> 29:54.688
Peter?

29:54.760 --> 29:56.285
Christina.

29:56.520 --> 29:57.646
<i>Where are you?</i>

29:57.720 --> 29:59.722
I'm...

30:02.680 --> 30:05.365
I'm not doing so well.

30:05.440 --> 30:07.568
Where are you, <i>Peter?</i>

30:10.560 --> 30:12.085
I'm in my car.

30:12.240 --> 30:13.730
<i>Are you driving?</i>

30:13.880 --> 30:15.166
No.

30:15.240 --> 30:16.969
<i>Tell me where you are.</i>

30:18.320 --> 30:20.368
I'm outside my kids' house.

30:20.440 --> 30:22.488
<i>You mean Madeleine's? Yeah.</i>

30:22.560 --> 30:26.485
<i>I need you to stay
right there. Okay, Peter?</i>

30:26.560 --> 30:28.324
<i>You'll stay there?</i>

30:30.080 --> 30:31.969
<i>Peter.</i>

30:32.040 --> 30:34.441
<i>Peter,
are you still there?</i>

30:34.560 --> 30:36.244
<i>Hello?</i>

30:37.400 --> 30:38.925
<i>Hello?</i>

31:09.000 --> 31:10.843
I'd like to turn myself in.

31:10.960 --> 31:13.008
For what?

31:14.280 --> 31:16.681
A few months ago,

31:16.760 --> 31:20.003
I was pulled over
for drunk driving.

31:20.080 --> 31:22.162
They let me go.
I should've been convicted.

31:22.800 --> 31:26.441
Well, if you were let go, sir,
we can't arrest you for it now.

31:30.040 --> 31:33.806
Well, I drunk drove here.
Arrest me for that.

31:34.800 --> 31:36.165
We can put you
in a detox tank...

31:36.240 --> 31:38.925
I want to be
formally arrested.

31:40.000 --> 31:43.083
My name is
Congressman Peter Russo.

31:44.840 --> 31:48.765
I was arrested in January
on Michigan Avenue.

31:52.000 --> 31:54.287
Please have a seat,
Congressman.

31:58.320 --> 32:00.687
I gotta make
a few phone calls.

33:02.560 --> 33:05.131
<i>FRANCIS: Have you</i> found <i>him? DOUG:
I'm in front of his ex-wife's house.</i>

33:05.200 --> 33:06.725
But Christina said
he called from there.

33:06.800 --> 33:08.211
<i>He's not there?</i>

33:08.320 --> 33:09.685
No.

33:09.800 --> 33:12.326
But his phone is.
I found it by the curb.

33:12.600 --> 33:14.045
So we have no
way to contact him?

33:14.120 --> 33:16.521
<i>Not unless he
reaches out to us.</i>

33:16.640 --> 33:17.766
This isn't good.

33:17.880 --> 33:18.961
<i>Want me to alert
the authorities?</i>

33:19.760 --> 33:22.411
Let's give him a little longer.

33:22.560 --> 33:25.450
- How long did it last?
- About six months.

33:26.120 --> 33:27.246
He was older.

33:27.400 --> 33:28.526
A lot?

33:30.560 --> 33:32.050
Yeah.

33:32.120 --> 33:35.488
Was he a journalist,
or did he work on the Hill?

33:38.480 --> 33:40.608
I'd rather not say.

33:41.200 --> 33:43.282
All right.

33:45.360 --> 33:48.364
He was someone I looked
up to for a while.

33:50.480 --> 33:52.528
Why did it end?

33:54.480 --> 33:55.970
He has a wife.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.805
We both knew it was
going to end eventually.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.128
I mean,
it was really...

34:03.680 --> 34:06.763
It was fucked up.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.205
The first night
we spent together,

34:08.280 --> 34:10.601
he told me he was gonna hurt
me and then discard me.

34:11.639 --> 34:15.121
And when it ended, I told
him that he'd done neither.

34:15.280 --> 34:18.681
But it does hurt.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.847
I won't hurt you.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.643
Yeah, you can't
promise me that.

34:23.760 --> 34:25.409
Yes, I can.

34:30.360 --> 34:31.725
Has anyone
else seen him?

34:31.880 --> 34:33.245
No.

34:33.320 --> 34:35.402
He's in an interrogation
room by himself.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.844
I never should've got
mixed up in this fucking mess.

34:42.000 --> 34:44.128
We're way behind
regret time, Barney.

34:45.719 --> 34:48.530
Just have your guys
keep him out of sight.

34:48.600 --> 34:50.806
I'll need
a back exit.

35:16.360 --> 35:18.169
I got him. Thanks.
Yeah.

35:18.240 --> 35:19.730
Come on.

35:30.480 --> 35:33.689
Hey, Peter.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.888
Where's your car?

35:39.160 --> 35:40.605
It's down the street.

35:40.680 --> 35:44.162
I'll drive you home. You go back
to mine, have Meechum let you in.

35:44.240 --> 35:46.527
This way?
Yeah.

35:51.360 --> 35:52.805
<i>FRANCIS: What were you
thinking, Peter?</i>

35:55.040 --> 35:58.169
I need to take responsibility
for my actions.

35:58.240 --> 35:59.969
By getting yourself
thrown in jail?

36:00.040 --> 36:01.963
Real responsibility.

36:03.440 --> 36:06.171
Like they talk
about in the meetings,

36:06.240 --> 36:07.765
not the lies we
told for the campaign.

36:08.080 --> 36:10.082
What you just did
was extremely reckless.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.288
I don't care.

36:15.360 --> 36:18.489
I'm making a statement
tomorrow, Frank.

36:19.840 --> 36:21.922
About pulling
out of the race?

36:22.000 --> 36:23.047
That's not enough. I...

36:27.520 --> 36:30.046
I need to stop hiding.

36:33.600 --> 36:35.568
Well, let's work
together on the language.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.405
I have to do it on my own.
It's gotta be in my own words.

36:38.480 --> 36:41.165
Look, Peter, this isnâ€™t just
about you anymore, all right?

36:41.240 --> 36:44.403
Let me help you.
I don't want your help.

36:47.000 --> 36:50.800
I didn't ever ask your help
when I got arrested.

36:50.880 --> 36:52.325
When has your
help ever helped me?

36:54.720 --> 36:56.961
You can live your
life the way you want to.

36:57.040 --> 36:59.805
I'm done being
told how to live mine.

37:02.520 --> 37:04.807
Well, there has to be
a way to take responsibility

37:04.880 --> 37:08.566
without shattering everything.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.683
Are you at least willing
to have that discussion?

37:41.400 --> 37:42.481
Do you want me
to come upstairs?

37:42.560 --> 37:44.005
No.

38:06.120 --> 38:09.522
I know you're in
a lot of pain, Peter.

38:11.920 --> 38:13.763
But I don't want you to
feel any pain tonight.

38:14.720 --> 38:17.200
Here. You can
start fresh tomorrow.

38:17.440 --> 38:21.206
Go ahead. I won't judge you.
Hell, I'll even join you.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.888
Just relax.

38:29.280 --> 38:31.408
You're home now.

38:38.160 --> 38:40.162
Whatever it is you
have to face tomorrow,

38:40.240 --> 38:42.686
you don't have to
face it now.

38:44.320 --> 38:47.164
Right now,
it's just you and me.

38:51.160 --> 38:54.004
The rest of the world
doesn't matter.

38:56.240 --> 38:59.005
Your children,
Christina,

38:59.080 --> 39:01.162
they will forgive you,

39:01.440 --> 39:04.410
because you're loved,
Peter.

39:05.560 --> 39:07.608
Failed.

39:10.400 --> 39:12.687
I failed myself.

39:12.760 --> 39:15.286
I failed my family.

39:16.360 --> 39:19.091
I failed the campaign.

39:21.360 --> 39:23.442
No, you haven't, Peter.

39:26.160 --> 39:28.242
May I?

39:44.280 --> 39:46.169
You know, when Claire and
I were first married,

39:46.240 --> 39:49.608
we talked about
having children.

39:49.720 --> 39:52.371
I told her flat out
I didn't want any.

39:52.440 --> 39:56.081
It was selfish
but honest

39:56.480 --> 39:59.086
I didn't have a particularly
happy childhood.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.322
I suspect
you didn't either.

40:01.400 --> 40:02.640
No.

40:02.760 --> 40:05.240
You see, no person
avoids pain.

40:05.320 --> 40:07.004
And I just didn't
think it was right

40:07.160 --> 40:08.844
to bring a child
in knowing that.

40:11.920 --> 40:15.527
But now when
I think back, I...

40:15.640 --> 40:18.405
I realize that
was cowardly.

40:21.400 --> 40:23.243
I see you,

40:23.840 --> 40:28.050
and I think, well, there's a
brave man, far braver than me.

40:28.160 --> 40:31.004
I'm so tired.

40:32.520 --> 40:35.364
When I think
aboutâ€œ

40:36.880 --> 40:39.611
I'm so tired.

40:43.320 --> 40:45.891
You should
close your eyes.

40:49.040 --> 40:51.361
Let it all go.

40:55.000 --> 40:58.368
We have all
the time in the world.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.724
Peter?

41:13.120 --> 41:15.248
Peter.

43:32.720 --> 43:34.085
I walked back.

43:49.720 --> 43:52.166
Whatever happens in
the next few hours,

43:52.240 --> 43:54.527
whatever you hear,

43:55.840 --> 43:58.127
we will never
speak of it.

44:33.280 --> 44:35.248
Sir...

44:37.440 --> 44:40.171
I heard from Linda
about a half an hour ago.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.123
The President
wants to meet with you.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.049
8230.

44:46.400 --> 44:48.687
About what?

44:48.760 --> 44:51.206
I don't know.

45:00.600 --> 45:01.601
Frank.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.885
You know, when you brought
up this idea, I wasn't sold.

45:14.280 --> 45:17.204
It struck me as both
desperate and careless.

45:17.960 --> 45:21.601
But then Linda
laid out all the pros,

45:21.680 --> 45:23.523
and they clearly
outweigh the cons.

45:24.360 --> 45:26.328
I explained our
reasoning to Jim and hoped

45:26.440 --> 45:28.363
he wouldn't think
I was off my rocker.

45:28.440 --> 45:31.842
I did at first, but the President
made some very good arguments.

45:33.160 --> 45:35.208
It's a bold move, Frank.
I'm very impressed.

45:35.280 --> 45:37.726
Well, thank you, sir,
for being open to the idea.

45:37.800 --> 45:40.690
And thank you, Mr. President,
for taking the risk.

45:40.800 --> 45:42.370
We'll need to work
this out step-by-step.

45:42.480 --> 45:43.641
The execution
has to be perfect.

45:43.800 --> 45:44.961
Where are things
with Russo?

45:45.040 --> 45:46.041
Any word from him yet?

45:46.160 --> 45:47.127
We're still
trying to locate him.

45:47.240 --> 45:49.242
Well, is there any cause for worry?
It's been two days.

45:49.320 --> 45:50.924
I am a bit worried,
I have to admit.

45:51.000 --> 45:53.685
I mean, this must be an extremely
difficult moment for him.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.325
We're hoping he'll
reach out shortly.

45:55.440 --> 45:58.205
Let's get our people on it.
I want to know where he is.

45:58.280 --> 46:00.248
Now, once he withdraws,
we have to move quickly.

46:00.360 --> 46:02.840
We'll make a joint statement,
as you proposed.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.089
It's a clear message,
I think.

46:05.160 --> 46:07.208
Pennsylvanians matter to us, and
we're not gonna let them down.

46:07.600 --> 46:09.011
That's right.
I'll say that Jim's

46:09.200 --> 46:10.611
an invaluable asset
to the White House,

46:10.680 --> 46:13.286
but that I have great
admiration for the sacrifice

46:13.360 --> 46:15.203
he's willing to make for
the people of his home state.

46:15.280 --> 46:17.965
And you should not accept his
resignation until he's elected.

46:18.040 --> 46:19.963
That will show your
continuing commitment to him.

46:20.040 --> 46:21.405
I think that's
a very good idea.

46:21.480 --> 46:23.960
As long as I can devote myself
wholly to the campaign, I agree.

46:24.040 --> 46:25.485
Now, should Jim win,
we'll need to

46:25.600 --> 46:27.125
nominate a Vice
President immediately.

46:27.200 --> 46:28.964
Linda, are you putting
together a list of names?

46:29.040 --> 46:30.690
Yes. And you can begin
the vetting process

46:30.800 --> 46:32.450
as soon as you
narrow down the choices.

46:32.560 --> 46:34.562
I already have a short
list of top contenders.

46:34.680 --> 46:35.886
I want your
input on that, Jim.

46:36.040 --> 46:37.280
More than happy.

46:39.680 --> 46:41.603
Congressman?

46:44.000 --> 46:45.365
Congressman?

47:01.080 --> 47:03.003
We can use the
existing infrastructure.

47:03.080 --> 47:04.730
Are you okay
with Nash Aarons?

47:04.880 --> 47:07.611
I like Nash, but I'll want to
bring in some of my own people.

47:07.720 --> 47:09.927
Well, that won't be a problem.
Nash is a team player.

47:10.000 --> 47:11.525
And we can reallocate
some of your

47:11.680 --> 47:13.205
existing 2016
reelection funds...

47:13.320 --> 47:15.402
Excuse me. Linda.

47:16.400 --> 47:18.562
Peter Russo is dead.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.327
Suicide.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.683
He was found in his garage
with the car still running.

47:27.800 --> 47:30.531
I'm so sorry, Frank.

47:30.600 --> 47:33.331
May I have a moment, sir?
Of course.

47:34.360 --> 47:37.204
I will get more information and
start drafting a statement.

47:37.280 --> 47:40.124
Let's reschedule. Whenever
is best for Frank.

47:57.200 --> 47:59.567
