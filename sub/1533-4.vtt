- The kind I have to keep.

It was on its way to Central City Museum
for exhibition.

Right. Iris was trying to talk me into going.

Sorry, captain,
I was at the hospital visiting a friend.

like someone interrupted the robbery.

- Guard says there was three of them.
-Actually, it was four.

04:34.880 --> 04:38.771
I mean that's how many I would bring
if I were doing a robbery of this nature.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.849
That's definitely a four-guy truck.
