01:32.992 --> 01:34.108
Hit it, hit it!

01:35.610 --> 01:37.113
Way to go.

01:42.695 --> 01:44.198
I'm trying here.

01:45.185 --> 01:46.688
Way to go, Jay Parks!

01:55.962 --> 01:57.421
Okay, let's go.

01:57.422 --> 02:01.929
Forward eye.
6-22. X-3. Okay?

02:01.930 --> 02:03.732
Right.
On one, on one. Ready?

02:07.855 --> 02:08.842
Six.

02:10.346 --> 02:11.333
Six.

02:11.848 --> 02:13.094
Two.

02:14.382 --> 02:16.871
Six. Three. Four.

02:38.511 --> 02:41.086
My name is Morgan.
I play football.

02:41.087 --> 02:44.564
We worked our butts off trying to get
it together for the big Sunday game.

02:44.565 --> 02:47.913
So the coach told us to knock it off,
and relax for a few days.

02:47.914 --> 02:49.930
One of my teammates, Davis,

02:49.931 --> 02:51.819
came up with the idea that
we head out to the island.

02:51.820 --> 02:54.310
He went ahead to
make the arrangements.

02:54.311 --> 02:56.243
I talked our PR man, Brian,
into coming along.

02:56.244 --> 02:59.677
I felt the day off
would do him some good, too.

02:59.678 --> 03:01.180
It'll be great to be
in the country again,

03:01.181 --> 03:02.511
and enjoy some
of the open spaces

03:02.512 --> 03:05.516
that man hasn't screwed up
with his technology.

03:05.517 --> 03:07.706
My father used to say, "Morgan,

03:07.707 --> 03:09.208
"one of these days
the earth will get even

03:09.209 --> 03:11.829
"with man for messing her up
with his garbage.

03:12.344 --> 03:13.846
"Just let man
continue to pollute the earth

03:13.847 --> 03:16.336
"the way he is,
and nature will rebel.

03:16.337 --> 03:19.427
"And it's going to be
one hell of a rebellion."

03:19.428 --> 03:21.403
Of course,
I never took him seriously,

03:21.404 --> 03:23.936
but I still remember the way
he looked at me when he said,

03:23.937 --> 03:26.126
"You'll never know when and
where it's going to happen.

03:26.641 --> 03:30.161
"And once it starts, you'll never
know how and when it'll stop."

03:30.162 --> 03:32.179
It's funny how my father's
prediction comes to mind

03:32.180 --> 03:34.670
when I go to the country,
like today.

05:14.281 --> 05:15.783
Venison tonight, right?

05:16.299 --> 05:17.285
.We haven't got him yet

05:17.286 --> 05:18.274
We will.

05:18.788 --> 05:20.291
They've got it!

05:33.859 --> 05:34.847
Go on, beat it.

05:36.693 --> 05:38.110
Hey, what'd you do that for?

05:38.582 --> 05:41.887
Come on, Davis. We won. The poor
bastard lost. What more do you want?

05:41.888 --> 05:42.747
Get out of here.

05:43.262 --> 05:44.765
Hey, come on, let him go.

07:18.149 --> 07:20.682
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

07:59.496 --> 08:00.569
Jesus.

08:16.068 --> 08:17.357
Oh, my God.

08:24.312 --> 08:27.318
You stay with him, Brian,
I'll be right back, okay?

09:09.910 --> 09:11.413
Hello.

09:13.774 --> 09:15.277
Hello?

09:17.766 --> 09:19.270
Hello.

09:35.928 --> 09:36.916
Hello?

11:07.810 --> 11:11.331
Where the hell did you get
those goddamn chickens?

11:11.803 --> 11:14.808
Hey, do you know those
bastards almost killed me, huh?

11:19.703 --> 11:21.678
You had no business in there.

11:21.679 --> 11:23.652
Look, my name is Morgan.
I need a telephone.

11:23.653 --> 11:25.156
There's been a bad accident
in the woods out there.

11:25.157 --> 11:26.100
My friend is dead.

11:26.101 --> 11:27.732
We don't have no phone.

11:27.733 --> 11:29.105
Well, where can I find one?

11:29.106 --> 11:30.436
None nearby, you can't.

11:30.437 --> 11:32.412
We're the only farm
on this end of the island.

11:32.798 --> 11:34.300
What? No one else?

11:34.301 --> 11:37.778
That horse, did you get it from
the stable near the ferry landing?

11:37.779 --> 11:39.181
Yes, I did.

11:39.182 --> 11:42.286
Well, when you take it back,
they got a phone.

11:42.287 --> 11:44.407
Thanks a lot. By the time I get
there I won't need one.

11:44.692 --> 11:46.966
Please, mister...

11:46.967 --> 11:48.188
Could you take a
look at something that

11:48.270 --> 11:50.687
scared the wits out of me?

11:50.688 --> 11:52.763
Hey, look, lady, I've already
seen your chickens.

11:52.764 --> 11:55.210
No.
No, this is something else.

11:55.211 --> 11:57.700
I wouldn't ask
if Mr. Skinner was here.

11:57.701 --> 12:00.190
The Lord knows I wouldn't.

12:00.191 --> 12:03.067
But I'm frightened
they've got to it.

12:03.068 --> 12:04.398
What do you mean, "they"?

12:04.399 --> 12:06.888
Please, mister,
will you take a quick look,

12:06.889 --> 12:09.893
and tell me if you think,
it's what I think it is?

12:09.894 --> 12:10.925
Please.

12:23.419 --> 12:24.922
Look.

12:25.910 --> 12:28.142
Do those look
like ratholes to you?

12:28.572 --> 12:30.073
Yeah, they sure do.

12:30.074 --> 12:31.577
I knew it.
They got at the food.

12:32.049 --> 12:33.552
They must've.

12:35.570 --> 12:37.673
Is this what you've been
feeding those chickens?

12:37.674 --> 12:41.881
No. This is the way
it comes to us from the Lord.

12:41.882 --> 12:43.385
The chickens
won't touch none of it,

12:43.856 --> 12:46.775
unless we mix it with
the meal and the bran.

12:46.776 --> 12:49.266
Yeah, well, that wasp seems to
like it well enough.

12:49.267 --> 12:50.683
I mean, what is it?

12:50.684 --> 12:53.688
The good Lord give it to us
'cause we're deserving people.

12:53.689 --> 12:56.350
And we pray regularly, we do.

12:56.866 --> 12:58.187
And the Lord is
going to see to it

12:58.326 --> 13:00.343
that we don't need
money no more. Never.

13:00.344 --> 13:02.061
Look, lady,
I don't think you realize

13:02.062 --> 13:03.908
how dangerous this
stuff could really be.

13:04.379 --> 13:06.396
Mr. Skinner's in
the city this minute,

13:06.397 --> 13:09.702
making a big, important
money deal for this food.

13:09.703 --> 13:11.205
That's what he's doing,
right now,

13:11.206 --> 13:14.211
at the same time
we're standing here talking.

13:14.212 --> 13:15.514
Yeah, but that's not
gonna help very much

13:15.515 --> 13:17.732
if something besides those
chickens have gotten into this food.

13:17.733 --> 13:20.737
Well, nothing on our farm
killed your friend,

13:20.738 --> 13:22.197
if that's what you're thinking.

13:22.198 --> 13:24.215
Lady, how large do you think
those rats will grow

13:24.216 --> 13:25.589
if they've gotten into
this food of yours, huh?

13:25.590 --> 13:27.093
Mr. Skinner'll know
what to do,

13:27.565 --> 13:29.582
no matter what ate it up.

13:29.583 --> 13:31.987
He'll know exactly what to do.

13:31.988 --> 13:34.993
Yeah, well, I hope so,
because I'll be coming back.

14:26.601 --> 14:29.091
I didn't think
we'd be going back like this.

14:30.121 --> 14:31.109
Yeah.

14:36.605 --> 14:38.623
What do we do now?

14:39.867 --> 14:42.573
I guess we let
the coroner figure it out.

14:44.075 --> 14:46.308
We gotta tell him
what we think, don't we?

14:46.309 --> 14:47.338
No, I don't think so.

14:47.811 --> 14:49.040
I mean, we'd sound like
a couple of prize idiots

14:49.041 --> 14:50.072
telling the District Attorney

14:50.073 --> 14:52.963
a giant something or other
killed our buddy, wouldn't we?

14:54.466 --> 14:56.698
How many times you been
busted up playing pro ball?

14:57.214 --> 14:58.200
I don't know.

14:58.201 --> 14:59.704
I don't think
there's a guy in the league

14:59.705 --> 15:02.236
who hasn't been
laid out once or twice.

15:02.237 --> 15:03.525
Except Davis.

15:05.328 --> 15:08.676
Been playing with the team
for seven years.

15:08.677 --> 15:11.082
Never even been
carried off the field.

15:12.112 --> 15:13.529
Yeah, so what's the point?

15:14.001 --> 15:16.018
So, what I want to know is,
how does a guy with all that luck

15:16.019 --> 15:18.037
have this happen to him?

15:20.957 --> 15:22.932
Well, I guess his luck ran out.

17:10.185 --> 17:12.203
Oh, excuse me, sir.

17:13.276 --> 17:14.778
Yes?

17:14.779 --> 17:16.796
Anything happen today, sir?

17:16.797 --> 17:18.770
Happen?

17:18.771 --> 17:20.402
Like, unusual.

17:20.403 --> 17:24.395
Well, a man was killed stag
hunting on one of the islands.

17:24.396 --> 17:26.413
Fell off his horse.

17:26.414 --> 17:27.744
You mean, unusual like that?

17:28.218 --> 17:29.205
Not exactly.

17:30.707 --> 17:32.724
I saw the body.

17:32.725 --> 17:34.700
His two friends
brought him across.

17:34.701 --> 17:37.706
He was all swollen and ugly.

17:37.707 --> 17:39.209
You know what I mean?

17:41.227 --> 17:44.231
I don't suppose
his friends said anything

17:44.232 --> 17:47.323
about seeing some
big things, did they?

17:47.324 --> 17:49.299
Anything of that sort, sir?

19:26.204 --> 19:27.191
God!

19:35.779 --> 19:37.237
Oh, God!

21:44.713 --> 21:46.474
Who's there?

22:08.800 --> 22:12.879
Lord, save me, save me.

23:22.091 --> 23:24.065
I just came from
the coroner's office.

23:24.066 --> 23:25.568
Yeah, what'd he say?

23:25.569 --> 23:27.586
From the amount of
poison in his body,

23:27.587 --> 23:32.567
he estimates that Davis was stung
by no less than 250 wasps.

23:33.082 --> 23:34.070
Jesus.

23:36.603 --> 23:38.104
Come on, let's go.
Where to?

23:38.105 --> 23:39.307
The farm.

23:39.308 --> 23:40.595
Come on, what do you want
to go out there for?

23:40.596 --> 23:42.098
The ride.

23:42.099 --> 23:43.600
Well, I'd like to
go along with you,

23:43.601 --> 23:45.618
but I'm splitting for
Chicago tonight, remember?

23:45.619 --> 23:46.619
Come on, Brian, will you?

23:47.122 --> 23:49.611
Hey, baby, if I don't set up
that promotion in Chicago,

23:49.612 --> 23:52.102
you jocks ain't gonna have too many
fans watching you play football.

23:52.103 --> 23:53.305
Come on, you know darn well

23:53.306 --> 23:56.567
you don't have to be there
for at least two days.

23:56.568 --> 23:59.057
Well, all right.

23:59.058 --> 24:02.164
If the truth were known,
I'm really not all that ecstatic

24:02.179 --> 24:05.069
about going out there
with you, Morgan, you know.

24:33.965 --> 24:37.485
Oh, Tom, come on.
Please hurry.

24:38.988 --> 24:41.006
Tom, get it going.

24:41.479 --> 24:42.509
Oh!

24:42.981 --> 24:44.827
Oh, please stop.
Please.

24:49.851 --> 24:52.857
Please, please stop!

24:54.703 --> 24:56.204
Why didn't you stop?

24:56.205 --> 24:57.191
What for?

24:57.192 --> 24:59.209
The girl was pregnant.

24:59.210 --> 25:00.198
So?

25:00.199 --> 25:01.700
So she wanted something, Jack.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.203
Maybe they were in trouble.

25:03.204 --> 25:05.864
lt can wait.
We'll pick them up on the way back

25:05.865 --> 25:08.527
You don't care about anybody
but yourself, do you?

25:08.528 --> 25:10.630
Is that what you think of me?

25:10.631 --> 25:13.292
I think you're
the most selfish man I know.

25:13.293 --> 25:14.795
So why do you work for me?

25:14.796 --> 25:16.728
Because jobs for
female bacteriologists

25:16.729 --> 25:18.659
are just not that
easy to find, Jack.

25:18.660 --> 25:20.205
So who told you to be one?

25:20.206 --> 25:22.695
You're a bastard,
did you know that?

25:22.696 --> 25:24.714
As a matter of fact, I do.

25:36.693 --> 25:39.225
Oh, Tom,
I don't know what we're gonna do.

25:39.226 --> 25:40.213
.Just stay calm

25:40.214 --> 25:42.704
Don't worry about
a thing, sweetheart.

25:44.722 --> 25:47.213
Who put this goddamn gate here?

26:38.091 --> 26:39.808
Hey, what's that?

26:48.996 --> 26:51.057
Oh, my God!

26:51.058 --> 26:52.904
What do you suppose killed them?

26:53.418 --> 26:58.055
Well, whatever it was, it did
a good job on the barn doors.

26:58.056 --> 27:00.029
I'm really impressed, Jack
. How about you?

27:00.030 --> 27:02.563
Well, I don't know. You can't
tell much when they're dead.

27:02.564 --> 27:04.238
How do we know some clown
didn't make this thing

27:04.239 --> 27:07.072
out of plaster of Paris and
a handful of ostrich feathers?

27:08.575 --> 27:10.850
Let's see if we can
find Ma and Pa Kettle.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.146
I don't see anybody.

27:36.655 --> 27:37.685
Mr. Skinner!

27:38.930 --> 27:40.433
Hello!

27:40.905 --> 27:42.365
Anybody around?

27:45.499 --> 27:47.001
He said he'd be here.

27:47.002 --> 27:48.504
Well, maybe he's out back, huh?

27:48.505 --> 27:50.008
Yeah.

28:17.829 --> 28:19.847
Oh, I'm sorry, miss.

28:20.320 --> 28:21.821
I thought you was...

28:21.822 --> 28:24.355
Well, I don't know what...

28:24.356 --> 28:26.330
My heads all mixed up.

28:26.331 --> 28:29.336
It was them coming in.
Mr. Skinner said they would.

28:30.323 --> 28:32.857
What happened to your arm?

28:33.329 --> 28:37.965
It was the big worms, miss,
crawling horrible things.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.468
And then the rats came.

28:39.469 --> 28:40.499
Rats?

28:40.500 --> 28:44.921
In the barn, awful giant rats.

28:44.922 --> 28:46.511
Well, we're looking for
Mr. Skinner.

28:47.025 --> 28:48.528
What do you want him for?

28:48.529 --> 28:51.017
Well, we were supposed
to meet him out here today.

28:51.018 --> 28:53.980
Mr. Skinner didn't
come home last night.

28:53.981 --> 28:55.654
Maybe he stayed
over in the city.

28:55.655 --> 28:59.490
Well, that doesn't matter. You can
show us whatever you have out here.

28:59.491 --> 29:03.112
But Mr. Skinner never stays
away overnight. Never.

29:03.113 --> 29:06.432
Are you trying to tell me I've
wasted my time coming out here?

29:06.433 --> 29:08.149
Did you make a money deal with him?

29:08.150 --> 29:10.983
No, not exactly.

29:10.984 --> 29:13.473
Then, I'm afraid I can't
show you our secret.

29:13.474 --> 29:14.805
It wouldn't be right.

29:14.806 --> 29:18.210
Look, I didn't travel all the way
out here to this goddamn hole

29:18.211 --> 29:20.301
to see some dead
chicken carcasses.

29:20.616 --> 29:23.606
Now, do you have something
you want to sell or haven't you?

29:23.607 --> 29:27.256
Hold it, Jack. Why don't you just try
being a little human for a change?

29:27.728 --> 29:29.746
Mrs. Skinner, we have
to get back to the city.

29:30.219 --> 29:32.420
Couldn't you show us what
your husband fed the chickens?

29:32.552 --> 29:36.615
I won't let Mr. Bensington take
advantage of you, I promise.

29:36.616 --> 29:38.590
All right, miss, I'll show you.

29:38.591 --> 29:40.694
I don't care what happens.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.228
I just want my husband
to be with me again.

30:10.148 --> 30:11.179
See?

30:13.498 --> 30:16.888
That's what your husband
brought us out here for?

30:16.889 --> 30:19.379
Just like Mr. Skinner
found it.

30:19.380 --> 30:21.353
Just like that one day.

30:21.354 --> 30:22.858
At first he thought it was oil,

30:23.372 --> 30:25.389
and it was gonna make us rich.

30:25.390 --> 30:26.893
Come on, Lorna.

30:26.894 --> 30:29.382
But wait a minute, Jack,
wait a minute. Look at this.

30:29.383 --> 30:31.873
I've never seen
anything like it.

30:31.874 --> 30:33.195
Mrs. Skinner,
how did your husband

30:33.377 --> 30:34.706
happen to feed it
to the chickens?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.725
Well, when we found
out it weren't no oil,

30:37.041 --> 30:39.601
There was nothing to do about it,
so we fed it to the chicks.

30:39.903 --> 30:41.233
Right out of
the ground like that?

30:41.234 --> 30:42.735
No, miss.

30:42.736 --> 30:46.299
Nothing'll eat it unless
we mix it with chicken feed.

30:46.300 --> 30:48.789
And did all the chickens grow?

30:48.790 --> 30:50.637
Only the baby chicks.

30:51.667 --> 30:53.641
Nothing seemed to
effect the grown ones.

30:53.642 --> 30:54.829
Nothing at all.

30:54.830 --> 30:57.548
Nothing happens to the full-grown
chickens, is that right?

30:57.549 --> 31:00.768
Well, they didn't grow none,
if that's what you mean.

31:00.769 --> 31:02.744
But I didn't say
nothing happened to them.

31:03.260 --> 31:05.234
Well, what did happen?

31:05.235 --> 31:07.553
They got ate by
the real big ones.

31:09.571 --> 31:11.160
Come on, Lorna.

32:15.477 --> 32:17.350
Mrs. Skinner...
I don't like you.

32:17.385 --> 32:18.482
Well, if that stuff
is worth anything,

32:18.483 --> 32:21.913
I'd like an option until Miss Scott,
here gets the stuff analyzed.

32:22.003 --> 32:23.505
I don't want nothing
more to do with you.

32:23.506 --> 32:25.995
You didn't take me seriously
back there, did you?

32:25.996 --> 32:27.499
I was only
having a little joke.

32:28.014 --> 32:29.301
Jack, look!

32:56.695 --> 32:58.713
Oh, thank you.

32:59.700 --> 33:02.190
Did you see them?
It was last night.

33:02.191 --> 33:04.208
They were right there
in the middle of the road.

33:04.209 --> 33:05.196
Right in front of us.

33:05.711 --> 33:07.213
We almost hit one.
What were they?

33:07.214 --> 33:08.715
They couldn't have been
what they looked like.

33:08.716 --> 33:11.464
Yes, they were.
They were these huge rats.

33:11.980 --> 33:14.470
I've never seen
anything so ugly in my life.

33:14.786 --> 33:15.972
All right, we'll pull you out
and you follow us.

33:15.973 --> 33:17.990
It won't help.
I busted my rear axle.

33:17.991 --> 33:19.492
Are you going
back into the city?

33:19.493 --> 33:20.995
Well, we have to make
a stop at a farm, first,

33:20.996 --> 33:22.236
then we'll be going right back.

33:22.542 --> 33:23.528
Okay, but if we're still here,

33:23.529 --> 33:25.032
can we get a ride
back with you then?

33:25.547 --> 33:26.533
I think you'd
better come with us now.

33:26.534 --> 33:28.037
Oh, that's all right,
we'll be okay.

33:28.038 --> 33:29.969
We'll just stay inside the bus.

34:27.630 --> 34:28.620
Morgan.

34:55.710 --> 34:57.215
You okay?

35:00.005 --> 35:03.009
Damn fortunate
you happened along.

35:03.010 --> 35:06.702
Yeah. Well, actually,
we didn't just happen along.

35:06.703 --> 35:08.420
We came out here
to see Mr. Skinner.

35:08.421 --> 35:09.408
What about?

35:09.923 --> 35:12.155
Are you Mr. Skinner?
No, I'm not Mr. Skinner.

35:12.156 --> 35:14.646
Do you know about the food
the Skinners have up here?

35:14.647 --> 35:15.633
Yeah, a little.

35:15.634 --> 35:17.050
Well, I can tell you right now,

35:17.051 --> 35:18.552
if you're entertaining
any intentions

35:18.553 --> 35:20.999
of becoming involved,
you're too late.

35:21.000 --> 35:23.147
My company controls all rights.

35:24.135 --> 35:25.615
Well, then, maybe
it's not Mr. Skinner

35:25.637 --> 35:26.667
I want to see after all, is it?

35:26.668 --> 35:29.158
I'm not interested
in any partners.

35:29.159 --> 35:30.832
Until Mr. Skinner
comes home and says

35:30.833 --> 35:32.850
he wants you to have our food,

35:32.851 --> 35:36.456
Mr. Bensington,
nobody owns nothing but us.

35:36.457 --> 35:38.690
The good Lord give it to us
to do as we please.

35:41.352 --> 35:43.369
Well, it would appear
you were just moved back

35:43.370 --> 35:45.388
three spaces and lose a turn.

35:45.860 --> 35:48.393
Well, anyway,
my company has first refusal.

35:48.566 --> 35:51.266
Miss Scott here was present when
Mr. Skinner made us an offer.

35:51.613 --> 35:52.858
That was yesterday morning.

35:52.859 --> 35:54.789
Well, then, I suppose legally,
you just might be right.

35:54.790 --> 35:56.292
No question about it.

35:56.293 --> 35:57.296
Good.

35:57.311 --> 36:00.286
When I throw our charges with the
district attorney, I'll know who to name.

36:00.359 --> 36:02.391
What the hell
are you talking about?

36:02.605 --> 36:05.146
Second degree murder, I guess
that's what they'll call it.

36:05.325 --> 36:08.057
My friend was killed by your wasps
yesterday afternoon.

36:08.058 --> 36:09.560
They're not my wasps.

36:09.561 --> 36:11.062
Well, if you own the stuff
that made them grow,

36:11.063 --> 36:13.080
I guess you're liable
for whatever they do.

36:13.081 --> 36:14.267
Now, wait a minute.

36:14.268 --> 36:15.371
Oh, we'll wait
more than a minute.

36:15.372 --> 36:16.315
My buddy here
and I are going to

36:16.316 --> 36:17.756
give you a hand
in cleaning them out.

36:17.820 --> 36:20.594
Well, you'd better get the hell
off this land. You're trespassing.

36:20.595 --> 36:21.581
Sorry, can't do that.

36:21.582 --> 36:23.084
We'll have to get
the wasps in their nests,

36:23.085 --> 36:25.146
and they don't go
home till after dark.

36:25.876 --> 36:27.679
Dirty bastards!

36:39.701 --> 36:40.988
I'm Lorna Scott.

36:40.989 --> 36:42.949
Oh, you're with
Mr. Wonderful over there?

36:42.950 --> 36:46.227
I'm in charge of the bacteriostasis
in his plant, yes.

36:46.228 --> 36:47.729
It must be fascinating work.

36:47.730 --> 36:50.549
Since you're dying to know
what it is, I shall tell you.

36:50.550 --> 36:53.697
I keep the bacteria growth
within an acceptable tolerance.

36:53.698 --> 36:55.716
How interesting.

36:55.817 --> 36:57.675
Brian, we're gonna need something
that'll work for a wick.

36:57.676 --> 37:00.824
Maybe some rope rubbed down with
powder from our shotgun shells,

37:00.825 --> 37:04.688
and some plaster or cement.
See if the Skinners have any, okay?

37:04.689 --> 37:07.308
You don't like women around when
you're doing your thing, do you?

37:07.581 --> 37:09.798
What's my thing?
Facing danger.

37:09.799 --> 37:10.786
I don't mind.

37:11.301 --> 37:12.289
Are you sure?

37:12.804 --> 37:14.306
What's there to mind?

37:14.307 --> 37:15.809
Oh, can I come along?

37:15.810 --> 37:16.883
Why not?

37:18.386 --> 37:21.391
It won't be easy, but I think
I can learn to like you.

37:21.907 --> 37:23.408
You're the first man I've met
who has balls enough

37:23.409 --> 37:25.383
to beat Bensington
at one-upmanship.

37:25.384 --> 37:27.402
Really?
You're nice yourself.

37:29.721 --> 37:32.254
Thomas, she kicked.

37:34.744 --> 37:36.247
Right here.

37:38.823 --> 37:40.369
Like what you see?

37:43.589 --> 37:45.090
I realize I'm not very attractive

37:45.091 --> 37:46.371
being so pregnant
and all, but...

37:46.594 --> 37:49.198
No, it's not that.

37:49.199 --> 37:52.304
I just guess the whole thing
wasn't such a good idea, after all.

37:52.305 --> 37:54.751
I just thought we could
see things more clearly.

37:54.752 --> 37:57.757
Thomas, I'm seeing
things very clearly,

37:57.972 --> 37:59.302
and I'm not going
to change my mind.

37:59.303 --> 38:02.566
But it's my baby.
I want it to have my name.

38:02.567 --> 38:05.743
She'll have her own name.

38:05.744 --> 38:08.232
Did anybody ever tell you,
you're crazy?

38:08.233 --> 38:10.250
Why? Because I'm happy
we're having a baby?

38:10.251 --> 38:12.485
It'll be the same kid
even though we're married.

38:12.827 --> 38:14.845
But our relationship won't be,
yours and mine.

38:15.318 --> 38:16.562
But what's the difference,
damn it?

38:16.563 --> 38:18.322
We're still
the same two people.

38:18.323 --> 38:19.526
Just tell me
what the difference

38:19.527 --> 38:22.315
a lousy marriage certificate has
to do with our relationship?

38:22.316 --> 38:25.193
Hey, that is exactly what
I'm talking about. Nothing!

38:25.509 --> 38:27.727
And that's why
I don't want one.

38:28.929 --> 38:30.603
Thomas, look at me.

38:33.094 --> 38:34.596
You love me, don't you?

38:36.056 --> 38:37.772
And I love you.

38:37.773 --> 38:40.221
We live together.
We grow together.

39:02.718 --> 39:04.221
Do you believe that?

39:06.154 --> 39:07.656
It's huge.

39:10.147 --> 39:12.637
Come on, let's get
back to the farmhouse.

39:42.606 --> 39:45.137
Oh, God, forgive me
for doing bad things.

39:45.138 --> 39:49.948
I swear, I won't sin again if you
just return my husband to me.

39:50.120 --> 39:53.425
A doctor ought to be taking
care of this, Mrs. Skinner.

39:53.426 --> 39:55.444
The Lord healeth the sick,
Lorna.

39:55.916 --> 39:57.418
That's from the Bible.

39:57.934 --> 40:00.938
Yeah, well, I think maybe you
should drive back with us tonight

40:00.939 --> 40:02.441
Oh, no, I can't do that.

40:02.442 --> 40:05.962
When Mr. Skinner returns,
he'll want me to be here.

40:05.963 --> 40:07.079
He will.

42:41.174 --> 42:41.990
Mr. Morgan.

42:44.265 --> 42:47.271
Mr. Morgan. Mr. Morgan.
They got Lorna

42:47.786 --> 42:49.026
God have mercy
on the poor girl.

42:49.289 --> 42:50.275
Well, what happened?
I'll show you.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.294
I'll get my gun.
Yeah.

43:02.886 --> 43:05.775
That slope in back of the house.
That's where we saw them.

43:05.776 --> 43:07.278
Then, all at once,
they came at us!

43:07.279 --> 43:11.414
And Lorna ran up on the slope,
but the earth gave way.

43:11.815 --> 43:14.792
She fell in there.

43:14.793 --> 43:18.356
That's where the big rats went.
But Lorna's down in there.

43:19.945 --> 43:21.233
Lorna!

43:22.220 --> 43:23.721
Lorna, can you hear me?

43:23.722 --> 43:25.483
Morgan!

43:25.784 --> 43:27.757
Morgan, get me out of here!

43:27.758 --> 43:29.504
Okay, I'm coming down.

43:29.505 --> 43:30.686
You're sure they were rats?

43:30.808 --> 43:32.863
- I know a rat when I see one, mister.
- Give me a hand.

43:33.498 --> 43:35.057
They're nearly
as big as horses.

43:35.058 --> 43:38.049
Is there anything you didn't
feed the food to, Mrs. Skinner?

43:38.093 --> 43:39.866
Brian, get the rope and
flashlight from the jeep, okay?

43:39.982 --> 43:41.154
Right.

43:42.000 --> 43:43.601
Oh, Lord.

43:43.602 --> 43:48.009
It's happened, just as
Mr. Skinner said it would.

43:48.010 --> 43:51.288
Being punished 'cause
we sinned against nature.

43:51.802 --> 43:54.979
The only sin, Mrs. Skinner,
is your goddamn stupidity.

43:54.980 --> 43:57.555
You're not a good man,
Mr. Bensington.

43:57.556 --> 43:59.702
The things you say and do.

44:14.172 --> 44:15.201
You okay?

44:15.202 --> 44:17.220
Yeah.
Hand me the shotgun.

44:19.667 --> 44:20.955
Coming in.

44:22.330 --> 44:23.661
Got it?
Yeah.

44:42.896 --> 44:44.398
Take her up.

45:09.087 --> 45:11.147
Morgan! Morgan!

45:12.607 --> 45:14.110
Are you okay?
Yes.

45:16.128 --> 45:17.416
Morgan!

45:18.317 --> 45:19.347
Morgan!

45:20.335 --> 45:21.409
Morgan!

45:23.599 --> 45:25.316
Careful there.

45:27.591 --> 45:28.878
Where are those ratholes?

45:28.879 --> 45:30.383
There.

45:30.897 --> 45:31.885
There.

45:42.962 --> 45:44.979
Bensington,
will you go in with me?

45:44.980 --> 45:46.483
Don't be a fool.

47:16.604 --> 47:18.106
Thanks, Brian.

47:34.594 --> 47:36.097
You okay?

47:37.127 --> 47:39.101
Here.

47:39.102 --> 47:41.119
Thanks to you, kid,
we missed the last ferry.

47:41.120 --> 47:42.623
You bastard.

47:53.529 --> 47:55.116
Thomas.

47:55.117 --> 47:57.134
Honey.
Yes?

47:57.135 --> 47:59.625
Please, could you just
lift me up, please.

47:59.626 --> 48:01.127
Yeah, sure.

48:02.631 --> 48:03.618
You all right?

48:06.624 --> 48:07.654
Oh, yeah.

48:09.157 --> 48:11.132
It stopped. It stopped

48:14.138 --> 48:16.156
What the hell was that?

48:17.143 --> 48:17.959
Thomas.

48:24.013 --> 48:26.804
Rita. Rita,
come to the door.

48:27.576 --> 48:29.208
Come on out.

48:30.711 --> 48:32.213
Tom, what is it?

48:35.219 --> 48:36.507
Oh, my God!

48:38.439 --> 48:39.641
Tom!

49:01.538 --> 49:03.041
Oh, Tom!

49:06.090 --> 49:07.463
Look at them.

49:07.936 --> 49:09.437
Tom.

49:09.438 --> 49:10.468
Come on, let's get out of here.

49:10.469 --> 49:11.972
Come on. Come on.

49:43.056 --> 49:45.589
Oh, Tom, I can't..

49:45.590 --> 49:47.564
They're out there,
all over the place.

49:47.565 --> 49:50.097
- They're everywhere. They're everywhere.
- Big rats.

49:50.398 --> 49:52.072
Where? Out there on the road
where your camper was?

49:52.073 --> 49:54.090
By the camper, yeah.
Wait, how many were there?

49:54.091 --> 49:55.652
I don't know.
They're all over the road.

49:55.794 --> 49:57.868
Come on, Lorna, we'll drive right
through them.

49:57.869 --> 49:59.372
Hold it right there.

50:01.905 --> 50:03.322
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

50:03.323 --> 50:05.297
This car might be the only way
out of here for all of us.

50:05.298 --> 50:06.756
That's why I'm taking it.

50:06.757 --> 50:08.259
If anybody wants to come along,

50:08.260 --> 50:09.976
they can come.
Now give me the keys.

50:09.977 --> 50:11.222
Not until I know it's safe.

50:11.223 --> 50:12.124
Safe, hell!

50:12.396 --> 50:14.276
It's my car, god damn it!
Give me the keys.

50:14.658 --> 50:16.159
Okay, Bensington,
I'll give you your keys back,

50:16.160 --> 50:17.662
but if you try and
take any of these people

50:17.663 --> 50:19.224
out of here before
I tell you it's okay,

50:19.681 --> 50:23.029
you're gonna have more than
rats to fight. You got that?

50:24.018 --> 50:25.863
Hold it a second, Morgan.

50:25.864 --> 50:27.781
How could they get
at us inside the car?

50:27.782 --> 50:29.856
Well, after they force us off the
road, they'll give us a choice,

50:30.171 --> 50:31.471
of either dying inside the car

50:31.474 --> 50:32.905
or coming outside
and being eaten.

50:32.906 --> 50:35.823
Well, I don't hear you coming up
with a better suggestion.

50:35.824 --> 50:36.853
Well, how about this one?

50:36.854 --> 50:38.357
You and I go
for a ride in my jeep

50:38.358 --> 50:39.773
and take a little look
for ourselves, huh?

50:39.774 --> 50:41.062
What the hell for?

50:41.363 --> 50:43.553
I don't know. Maybe those kids
exaggerated a little.

50:43.554 --> 50:45.871
- I'm not interested.
- Maybe they exaggerated a lot.

50:45.872 --> 50:47.374
I'm still not interested.

50:47.760 --> 50:49.520
Well, just you and me,
Brian, let's go.

50:52.011 --> 50:54.028
Maybe he's right, Morgan.

50:54.029 --> 50:56.047
His car is closed.

50:56.520 --> 50:58.836
We could plow right
through the bastards.

50:58.837 --> 50:59.825
Okay, Brian, you go out there

50:59.826 --> 51:01.284
and plow right through
the rats with the man.

51:01.285 --> 51:03.473
If you don't make it,
no one can say you didn't try.

51:03.474 --> 51:05.448
All right, just tell me
one thing, okay?

51:05.449 --> 51:07.983
What the hell are we
going out there for?

51:09.228 --> 51:11.762
In this open jeep,
we don't stand a chance.

51:22.624 --> 51:24.127
Dumb bastards.

52:02.725 --> 52:04.529
They're even worse
than I thought.

52:40.638 --> 52:43.126
Jack?
Jack, the girl is sick.

52:43.127 --> 52:44.114
I don't know what to do.

52:44.115 --> 52:45.144
It's stopped.

52:45.145 --> 52:46.519
She could be
having a miscarriage.

52:46.520 --> 52:48.321
Help me! This is
the end of it. I want it all!

52:48.580 --> 52:50.082
Didn't you hear what I said?

52:50.083 --> 52:52.615
I said the girl is sick.
She could be dying.

52:52.616 --> 52:53.776
Find every container you can.

52:54.119 --> 52:56.437
Pails, bottles, jugs,
anything that'll hold it.

52:56.438 --> 52:58.269
We'll load the car
and then get out of here.

52:58.270 --> 52:59.872
You don't give a damn
about the girl, do you?

52:59.873 --> 53:02.491
You don't give a damn about anybody,
but yourself and money.

53:02.492 --> 53:04.466
Do you know what
this food is worth?

53:04.467 --> 53:07.815
Enough millions, you can use
$100 bills for toilet paper.

53:07.816 --> 53:10.305
You can flush it down the toilet
without even counting it.

53:10.306 --> 53:13.310
Well, I didn't know that's what
you wanted money for, Jack.

53:13.311 --> 53:15.414
I'll give you one thing,
though, you're creative.

53:15.415 --> 53:18.721
You're a no good son of a bitch,
but you're creative.

53:27.823 --> 53:31.344
What are you stopping for?
What are you doing?

53:33.362 --> 53:36.368
You don't think that's going
to keep them out, do you?

53:43.366 --> 53:45.855
I'm going to follow that road,
right down there.

53:45.856 --> 53:49.375
That road?
That's the way the rats are coming.

53:49.376 --> 53:50.879
The rats are coming...

53:50.880 --> 53:52.854
Oh, relax, will you, Brian
? Relax.

54:10.587 --> 54:13.119
Well, we're in luck.
The fence runs right into the water.

54:13.120 --> 54:16.124
Oh, Jesus Christ, Morgan!
You saw how big they are.

54:16.125 --> 54:19.131
This goddamn fence isn't going to stop
them, nothing's going to stop them.

54:19.132 --> 54:20.461
Well, maybe not.

54:20.462 --> 54:23.939
Even if it did, they can swim.
You know that? Rats can swim.

54:23.940 --> 54:25.342
They'll swim right
around the end of it.

54:25.343 --> 54:26.972
No, I don't think so.
I think if they go in the water,

54:26.973 --> 54:28.533
they'll sink
straight to the bottom.

54:28.534 --> 54:30.036
Come on, are you kidding me?

54:30.037 --> 54:32.913
You ever seen movies of
a hippopotamus in the water?

54:32.914 --> 54:34.173
I should swim so well.

54:34.174 --> 54:36.391
Yeah, well, they've been doing it
for a hell of a long time.

54:36.392 --> 54:37.178
So have rats.

54:37.179 --> 54:38.880
Yeah, at a weight
of about 10 ounces.

54:38.881 --> 54:39.868
So?

54:39.869 --> 54:41.171
At 150 pounds,

54:41.172 --> 54:43.389
the gravity pull is gonna make it
a whole new thing.

54:43.390 --> 54:45.880
I think they're gonna have to learn
how to swim all over again.

54:46.395 --> 54:47.898
You could be wrong.

54:54.295 --> 54:56.312
.And the fence goes to
the water on this end, too

54:56.313 --> 54:59.319
If they attack us out here
in the open, we're dead.

55:06.876 --> 55:08.617
We've got an unbroken
wire fence running across

55:08.650 --> 55:10.867
the north side of the island, with
water on both sides.

55:10.868 --> 55:11.855
It won't even slow them down.

55:11.856 --> 55:13.315
Charged with electricity,
it will.

55:13.316 --> 55:15.804
You should see how
funny you look, Jack.

55:15.805 --> 55:17.780
You're scared shitless
the rats will come,

55:17.781 --> 55:19.411
but you want money
badly enough to chance it.

55:19.412 --> 55:22.460
Well, fill this, god damn it!
The stuff is drying up.

55:22.461 --> 55:24.950
I'm beginning to think maybe that
stuff should stay right where it is.

55:24.951 --> 55:27.140
What the hell
are you talking about?

55:27.141 --> 55:28.128
Well, it doesn't look so good,

55:28.129 --> 55:30.532
as a super-contribution
to the world, I mean.

55:30.533 --> 55:31.735
Starving people?

55:31.736 --> 55:33.537
And you're going to feed them
all with big chickens, right?

55:33.538 --> 55:36.028
Yeah, and giant cows and sheep,

55:36.029 --> 55:38.689
and ducks and fish,
and you name it!

55:38.690 --> 55:41.180
Yeah, well, it sounds good,
but wouldn't bigger creatures

55:41.181 --> 55:43.112
have larger appetites?

55:43.113 --> 55:44.614
I'm way ahead of you, kid.

55:44.615 --> 55:47.291
I'm going to take this stuff and
have it converted to plant food.

55:47.292 --> 55:49.982
Oh, and you're gonna feed all
the big animals with big plants.

55:49.983 --> 55:51.742
Right on.
And within five years,

55:51.743 --> 55:53.630
hunger will be
a thing of the past.

55:53.631 --> 55:55.606
And that's what you're
doing it for, is it, Jack?

55:55.607 --> 55:58.913
For the benefit of all the hungry
people throughout the world.

55:58.914 --> 56:00.000
Especially the children.

56:00.001 --> 56:01.702
Oh, God, you're going
to make me cry.

56:01.703 --> 56:03.720
Hey, Lorna, you surprise me.

56:03.721 --> 56:05.738
I always thought
you were like me.

56:05.739 --> 56:07.242
Anything for a buck.

56:07.243 --> 56:10.676
Oh, no, you underestimate
yourself, baby.

56:10.677 --> 56:12.995
Nobody could be
a whore like you.

56:12.996 --> 56:14.756
You're number one.

56:22.141 --> 56:24.158
I heard that argument
you had with Bensington.

56:24.159 --> 56:25.662
Are you that much concerned?

56:26.177 --> 56:27.163
No?

56:27.164 --> 56:28.251
Well, why'd you
throw away your job?

56:28.252 --> 56:29.954
I couldn't take the chance
the rats would get me

56:29.955 --> 56:32.874
before I told Bensington exactly
what I thought of him.

56:38.156 --> 56:39.658
You okay?

56:46.828 --> 56:48.845
I think I'm going
to be sick again.

56:48.846 --> 56:50.133
Get up. Come on.

57:05.119 --> 57:06.835
It's all my fault.

57:06.836 --> 57:09.097
Her pregnancy or
her being out here?

57:09.098 --> 57:09.986
Both.

57:10.101 --> 57:13.491
Well, it's too late to do
anything about either, isn't it?

57:13.492 --> 57:14.952
Oh, God, help us.

57:16.454 --> 57:18.213
I won't never sin again, never.

57:18.214 --> 57:22.551
Only don't let no rats eat us.
Please, God.

57:26.415 --> 57:27.918
- Is that enough?
- Yeah.

57:30.408 --> 57:31.911
Okay.
Good.

57:35.431 --> 57:36.934
Come on, baby.

57:40.456 --> 57:41.443
Choke this thing, here.

57:42.945 --> 57:44.620
There you go.

58:09.136 --> 58:11.154
Take the shotgun, Brian.

58:12.141 --> 58:13.643
You know something,

58:13.644 --> 58:16.649
I'm supposed to be in Chicago,
day after tomorrow.

58:16.650 --> 58:17.594
Yeah, I know.

58:18.110 --> 58:19.096
Think I'll make it?

58:19.097 --> 58:20.599
I sure hope so.

58:21.630 --> 58:23.734
Oh, Jesus, here they come.

58:27.298 --> 58:28.628
Don't shoot.

58:28.629 --> 58:30.046
What if it doesn't stop them?

58:50.397 --> 58:51.900
We won!

58:53.402 --> 58:54.862
Morgan, we won!

59:03.363 --> 59:05.003
All right, let's get
out of here. Come on.

59:11.993 --> 59:12.981
Okay.

59:33.117 --> 59:35.565
You were right!
They can't swim!

59:46.986 --> 59:48.488
Let's go.

59:53.555 --> 59:55.572
If I was a fish, I'd have thought
it was too easy.

59:55.573 --> 59:56.774
What's the matter?

59:56.775 --> 59:58.963
Did you count how many rats there
were back there at the water?

59:58.964 --> 01:00:00.681
- Just now?
- Yeah.

01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:01.969
No, I didn't count them.

01:00:01.970 --> 01:00:03.272
Yeah, well, if you had,
you'd find out

01:00:03.273 --> 01:00:04.459
that there's only
half the bastards

01:00:04.460 --> 01:00:05.447
we left back there
at that generator.

01:00:05.448 --> 01:00:06.950
So what?

01:00:06.951 --> 01:00:08.452
So, I think the rest
are up to something else.

01:00:08.453 --> 01:00:09.484
Like what?

01:00:09.956 --> 01:00:11.974
Like, we better
find out damn quick.

01:00:18.887 --> 01:00:20.690
Where the hell are you going?

01:00:22.021 --> 01:00:24.252
Come on, Morgan,
let's break this down.

01:00:24.253 --> 01:00:26.787
Come on, let's get
the hell out of here.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.199
Oh, God.

01:00:50.014 --> 01:00:51.474
Brian!

01:01:04.055 --> 01:01:04.870
Brian!

01:01:09.722 --> 01:01:10.968
Morgan!

01:01:21.100 --> 01:01:21.915
Morgan!

01:02:04.164 --> 01:02:06.696
If you care for that girl
in there with your baby,

01:02:06.697 --> 01:02:07.941
you better change your mind.

01:02:07.942 --> 01:02:10.647
Once I leave here, none of
you are going to get out alive.

01:02:10.648 --> 01:02:12.688
I couldn't take Rita back
out there with those rats.

01:02:13.137 --> 01:02:14.124
There's no way.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:15.628
You just didn't
see them like we did.

01:02:15.843 --> 01:02:18.117
Now, you listen to me, you get
that pregnant girl of yours

01:02:18.118 --> 01:02:19.621
out of here and into that car.

01:02:20.136 --> 01:02:21.594
And don't give me any bullshit.

01:02:21.595 --> 01:02:23.054
And the old lady goes, too.

01:02:23.055 --> 01:02:24.559
Well, get them, god damn it!

01:02:27.048 --> 01:02:28.122
Yeah, that's right, Jack.

01:02:28.637 --> 01:02:30.954
You be sure and take
Mrs. Skinner with you.

01:02:30.955 --> 01:02:33.446
You'll need her signature
for the rights, won't you?

01:02:44.009 --> 01:02:46.498
What happened to your friend?
He run out on you?

01:02:55.945 --> 01:02:58.691
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:01.998
Hey, come on.
Hey, let go of me, you son of a bitch

01:03:04.531 --> 01:03:08.952
Hey, hey! No, stop it!
Please, stop it!

01:03:08.953 --> 01:03:10.457
Stop, no!

01:03:17.755 --> 01:03:18.743
No!

01:03:22.006 --> 01:03:25.011
Oh, Lord!
Look! Look, look!

01:03:27.330 --> 01:03:29.176
Get the shotgun!

01:04:03.824 --> 01:04:05.328
Mr. Thomas.

01:04:27.654 --> 01:04:28.727
Thomas!

01:04:48.606 --> 01:04:50.668
Listen, everything's
going to be okay.

01:04:53.072 --> 01:04:56.593
Better go in the bedroom with Rita.
She's not feeling too well.

01:04:57.108 --> 01:04:58.588
Looks like
the white one's the leader.

01:05:04.535 --> 01:05:06.510
Save your energy, Thomas.
They're out of shotgun range.

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:08.843
Hey, we scared them off.
Yeah, for a while anyway.

01:05:08.844 --> 01:05:10.345
For a while? We can hold them
off forever, man.

01:05:10.346 --> 01:05:11.434
Just cool it, will you?

01:05:11.449 --> 01:05:13.222
Mr. Morgan!

01:05:13.523 --> 01:05:16.171
Mr. Morgan, the well's run dry.

01:05:16.643 --> 01:05:20.635
I been pumping and pumping
since the Lord knows when.

01:05:20.636 --> 01:05:21.681
Yeah, well,
you can stop pumping.

01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:24.286
Those rats have cut through
the pipe right to the well.

01:05:24.501 --> 01:05:26.203
What do we do about water?

01:05:26.204 --> 01:05:28.021
That's the least of our problems.
Those rats will be in here

01:05:28.022 --> 01:05:29.823
long before
we ever get too thirsty.

01:05:29.824 --> 01:05:31.284
Oh, my God.

01:05:38.883 --> 01:05:39.913
Hey, Morgan, how do we know

01:05:39.914 --> 01:05:42.405
we can't reach them
with our shotguns out there?

01:05:44.895 --> 01:05:47.513
Boy, just another 20 feet closer,
we'd get them all.

01:05:56.187 --> 01:05:58.004
Hey, you're
ruining those shells!

01:05:58.005 --> 01:06:00.694
Yeah, I know. But that's all we
got left to save us.

01:06:00.695 --> 01:06:02.196
Hey, look, Thomas, count
the shells we've got.

01:06:02.197 --> 01:06:03.700
If we're lucky enough
to knock out one rat

01:06:03.701 --> 01:06:04.802
with each shell,
there'd still be

01:06:04.803 --> 01:06:07.134
enough of those bastards left to
hold a hell of a people barbecue.

01:06:07.135 --> 01:06:09.109
Oh, you've got an answer
for everything, don't you?

01:06:09.110 --> 01:06:10.412
Well, maybe we shouldn't
have listened to you,

01:06:10.413 --> 01:06:12.114
maybe Bensington was right.

01:06:12.115 --> 01:06:13.236
Yeah, you got a point there.

01:06:13.662 --> 01:06:15.182
Well, nothing gets
to you, god damn it!

01:06:15.293 --> 01:06:16.795
We could've been
the hell away from here

01:06:16.796 --> 01:06:19.500
if it wasn't for you.

01:06:19.501 --> 01:06:21.833
I'll tell you what. Bensington's
car is still out there.

01:06:21.834 --> 01:06:23.891
You can take it if you want to.
I'm sure he won't mind.

01:06:33.970 --> 01:06:36.631
I know all about
delivering babies.

01:06:36.632 --> 01:06:39.336
Living on a farm,
you get to know those things.

01:06:39.337 --> 01:06:41.827
Everything's
going to be all right.

01:07:01.234 --> 01:07:03.252
- Lorna.
- Yeah.

01:07:05.227 --> 01:07:06.730
Can you handle one of these.
Sure.

01:07:07.245 --> 01:07:08.059
You ever shot one?
No.

01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:10.077
Oh, terrific.
Well, it's ready to go.

01:07:10.078 --> 01:07:12.118
Hold it tight against
your shoulder. It kicks, okay?

01:07:12.225 --> 01:07:13.256
Yeah.

01:08:29.551 --> 01:08:35.291
God, I know my husband isn't coming
back to me. I know it, I know it.

01:08:37.180 --> 01:08:40.071
Was the finest man
in the whole world.

01:08:48.270 --> 01:08:50.246
Is it possible that
Bensington was right?

01:08:50.247 --> 01:08:51.568
We could have
driven through them?

01:08:51.749 --> 01:08:53.765
Yeah, it's possible.

01:08:53.767 --> 01:08:57.372
How can you be so cool?
Aren't you afraid?

01:08:57.374 --> 01:08:59.390
Sure, but I'm more bothered
that those rats are out there

01:08:59.392 --> 01:09:00.895
trying to outsmart me.

01:09:04.888 --> 01:09:07.764
If I told you how I felt right now,
you'd think I was crazy.

01:09:07.765 --> 01:09:09.996
Tell me.

01:09:09.997 --> 01:09:12.402
I want you to make love to me.

01:09:13.904 --> 01:09:16.523
It is crazy, isn't it?
At a time like this.

01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:23.049
Listen,
the first thing we'll do

01:09:23.050 --> 01:09:23.935
when we get back
to the mainland

01:09:23.937 --> 01:09:25.654
is continue this
conversation, okay?

01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:28.545
But that's just it, I don't think
we'll ever get back.

01:09:33.010 --> 01:09:34.986
They're attacking again.
I need more shells.

01:10:07.573 --> 01:10:09.076
How's it going?

01:10:10.579 --> 01:10:12.082
I've been lying here,
thinking about what

01:10:12.097 --> 01:10:14.528
it's going to be like
when those rats get inside.

01:10:14.529 --> 01:10:16.503
Morgan says
we're gonna be fine.

01:10:16.504 --> 01:10:18.006
Do you believe that?

01:10:21.699 --> 01:10:25.205
You know, I used to think
about dying a lot.

01:10:27.110 --> 01:10:30.716
I'd sort of lie there in bed,
at night, in the dark.

01:10:32.690 --> 01:10:35.652
I guess I've always
had a terrible fear of it.

01:10:35.653 --> 01:10:37.370
Rita, don't.

01:10:37.371 --> 01:10:40.806
I used to fantasize
the most horrible death.

01:10:42.308 --> 01:10:44.541
You know, the most frightening.

01:10:47.418 --> 01:10:51.066
None of them come close
to being eaten by rats.

01:10:54.202 --> 01:10:57.207
The funny thing is,
now that it's happening,

01:11:00.727 --> 01:11:04.076
it really doesn't seem
to matter, except for my baby.

01:11:06.223 --> 01:11:07.726
What do you think
our chances are?

01:11:08.241 --> 01:11:09.227
Pretty good.

01:11:09.228 --> 01:11:10.215
Like hell.

01:11:10.216 --> 01:11:12.233
Have it your way.

01:11:12.234 --> 01:11:14.251
Any minute now those rats
are going to bust in here,

01:11:14.252 --> 01:11:16.613
and you're still fussing around
with some lousy jars.

01:11:16.614 --> 01:11:17.600
Well, it's something to do.

01:11:17.601 --> 01:11:18.845
Something to do?

01:11:18.846 --> 01:11:21.765
That, my dear boy,
is what life is all about.

01:11:21.766 --> 01:11:23.683
From the time you're born,
it's finding something to do

01:11:23.684 --> 01:11:26.918
while you're waiting to die,
and you try like hell to prevent it.

01:11:27.390 --> 01:11:29.880
I'm not afraid to die,

01:11:29.881 --> 01:11:32.413
'cause it means
I'll be with my husband again.

01:11:32.414 --> 01:11:33.916
I'm not afraid.

01:11:34.947 --> 01:11:35.934
Not afraid.

01:11:36.450 --> 01:11:37.480
Now, you get your ass
in gear and get over there,

01:11:37.952 --> 01:11:40.185
and put that strip in that
gasoline jar and move it!

01:11:56.371 --> 01:11:58.388
I think we ought to at least
talk about it. All of us.

01:11:58.389 --> 01:11:59.891
Yeah, about what?
Bensington's car.

01:11:59.892 --> 01:12:01.866
It's still out there, and
the rats haven't hurt it.

01:12:01.867 --> 01:12:03.241
I'll tell you what,
we'll take a vote on it.

01:12:03.242 --> 01:12:05.258
- Good. If we...
- After we come back.

01:12:05.259 --> 01:12:06.289
From where?

01:12:06.805 --> 01:12:07.791
Say, I'm not
going to leave Rita,

01:12:07.792 --> 01:12:08.864
if that's what you're thinking.

01:12:08.865 --> 01:12:11.485
Pick up those jars
of gasoline, Thomas!

01:12:12.988 --> 01:12:14.404
You're going to kill us.

01:12:14.405 --> 01:12:15.907
Now open the front door!

01:13:49.420 --> 01:13:50.837
Oh, God.

01:13:54.744 --> 01:13:56.075
God!

01:14:16.341 --> 01:14:17.328
No!

01:14:41.372 --> 01:14:42.360
Oh, no!

01:15:17.996 --> 01:15:20.829
I think the baby
means it this time.

01:15:46.763 --> 01:15:48.043
How did you know
there was a dam?

01:15:48.266 --> 01:15:49.295
Mrs. Skinner told me.

01:17:02.973 --> 01:17:05.206
Don't let the baby die
, please.

01:17:12.204 --> 01:17:15.166
Can you see?
Can you see the head?

01:17:15.439 --> 01:17:16.569
Push.

01:17:25.672 --> 01:17:27.146
Is the head coming?

01:17:36.334 --> 01:17:37.321
It's showing its head.

01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:38.823
Yeah?

01:17:38.824 --> 01:17:39.855
Yeah. Now, push.

01:17:40.542 --> 01:17:41.572
Push.

01:17:55.311 --> 01:17:56.170
Okay.

01:18:00.206 --> 01:18:01.965
Is it a boy? What is it?

01:18:01.966 --> 01:18:03.467
It's a boy.

01:18:03.468 --> 01:18:05.443
It's a boy? It's a boy.

01:18:13.774 --> 01:18:16.262
Jesus. We'll never get...
We won't by sitting here.

01:18:16.263 --> 01:18:18.540
Come on.
Light this thing.

01:18:43.142 --> 01:18:44.988
Everybody upstairs, now!

01:19:58.707 --> 01:19:59.609
Morgan!

01:21:12.385 --> 01:21:14.188
Oh, God, no!

01:23:24.368 --> 01:23:26.772
Well, I guess
that's the end of them.

01:23:26.973 --> 01:23:30.551
The end of Bensington's one
last big shot at immortality.

01:24:26.409 --> 01:24:29.027
We were able to get Thomas's
camper fixed long enough

01:24:29.028 --> 01:24:33.020
to get us back to the ferry and
away from that nightmare for good.

01:24:33.021 --> 01:24:34.438
I'm back with the team,

01:24:34.439 --> 01:24:38.016
and things won't be the same
without Brian and Davis.

01:24:38.417 --> 01:24:39.919
My father was right.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:44.012
The land rebelled much worse than
he ever could have imagined.

01:24:44.013 --> 01:24:47.533
Nature was attacked,
and hit back with a vengeance.

01:24:48.522 --> 01:24:50.239
I hope we got it all,

01:24:50.382 --> 01:24:54.102
and the Food of the Gods has gone
back to wherever it came from.

01:24:54.103 --> 01:24:55.776
I hate to think
what would happen

01:24:55.777 --> 01:24:58.310
if even a trace of
that stuff is left.

01:24:58.311 --> 01:24:59.812
If it got into
the watering ponds

01:24:59.813 --> 01:25:03.290
or into the irrigation ditches.

01:25:03.291 --> 01:25:07.284
Did we get it all?
Because if we didn't...
