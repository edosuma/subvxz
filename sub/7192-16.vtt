Jax.

00:03.336 --> 00:04.754

- I can't--

00:04.838 --> 00:05.714
I don't want to lose
my friends over this.

00:05.797 --> 00:07.966
- If it's not worth it,

00:08.048 --> 00:09.759
just say the word,
and we'll stop.

00:09.843 --> 00:12.387
- To have
my mother again?

00:12.470 --> 00:13.847
Of course
it's worth it.

00:13.930 --> 00:14.597
But I have to do it fast,
or it'll be too late

00:14.681 --> 00:16.933

00:17.016 --> 00:19.436

this done quickly?

00:19.519 --> 00:20.937
- With more power.

00:21.020 --> 00:21.938
Maddie wasn't enough.

00:22.021 --> 00:23.148
It has to come from

00:23.231 --> 00:24.190
one of the most powerful
witches around.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.860
- You already have
Maddie's powers

00:26.943 --> 00:28.319
and the Council's powers.

00:28.403 --> 00:30.363
You won't
even take mine.

00:30.447 --> 00:33.283
There are no more powerful
wizards or witches left.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.659

00:35.702 --> 00:36.619

Wait, you're serious?

00:43.835 --> 00:45.378

00:45.462 --> 00:46.296
And unlike Maddie
and the Council,

00:46.379 --> 00:48.339

his powers...

00:48.423 --> 00:49.340
I'm keeping them.

00:49.424 --> 00:50.842

00:50.925 --> 00:52.302
- Not both of us.

00:52.385 --> 00:54.137
If we use our magic
at the same time,

00:54.220 --> 00:55.805
like at Maddie's,
he won't be able to fight us.

00:55.889 --> 00:57.807
- I'm listening.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.809
- I'll get the power I need
for the Tambian Orb,

00:59.893 --> 01:01.644

will be powerless.

01:01.728 --> 01:02.645
Your family will be safe.

all this craziness.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.846
