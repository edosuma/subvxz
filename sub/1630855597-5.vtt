00:00.208 --> 00:02.085
<i>Previously on</i> Billions...

00:02.085 --> 00:05.171
The kid, Kai Huang Liu,
sells sham NFTs.

00:05.171 --> 00:07.799
Liu's pop
is a mega-billionaire!

00:07.799 --> 00:10.051
Does thrice-yearly deals
with none other

00:10.051 --> 00:11.678
than Michael Prince himself.

00:11.678 --> 00:14.097
Kai Huang Liu is on
one of Michael Prince's jets.

00:14.097 --> 00:15.932
What do you need to leave me
out of this, man?

00:15.932 --> 00:17.809
The kid in cuffs
on American soil.

00:17.809 --> 00:20.270
My plane was taken
under false pretenses.

00:20.270 --> 00:22.856
I have your self-research.

00:22.856 --> 00:24.107
This is the one anyone can get.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.734
This is the one only I can.

00:25.734 --> 00:27.861
As I see it now, if I
succeed in taking Prince out,

00:27.861 --> 00:30.113
I'm gonna have to rough up
each and every

00:30.113 --> 00:31.281
person who works there.

00:31.281 --> 00:32.907
How about we start
with the gentleman

00:32.907 --> 00:34.701
<i>who is bringing color
to your cheeks?</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.244
<i>His name is
Bradford Luke.</i>

00:36.244 --> 00:38.121
Southern Property
and Casualty is one of

00:38.121 --> 00:39.372
the major insurers down there.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.458
Once they declare Cat 5,
the bonds are triggered

00:41.458 --> 00:42.876
and used to pay claims.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.377
That's a buzzcut
for our total capital.

00:44.377 --> 00:46.129
<i>Rosie is officially designated</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:47.964
<i>a Category Four hurricane,
not a Category Five...</i>

00:49.049 --> 00:51.259
I took steps as I saw fit.

00:51.259 --> 00:52.844
You paid off
the hurricane grader.

00:52.844 --> 00:54.554
If anyone finds out
what you've done,

00:54.554 --> 00:56.097
my run is GD over.

00:56.097 --> 00:57.974
<i>You didn't screw up,
you tried to take him out.</i>

00:57.974 --> 01:01.770
Will you exercise the discipline
required to really do it right?

01:01.770 --> 01:05.106
- I will and we will.
- Damn right.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.345
What is it?

01:35.345 --> 01:38.389
We got mugged last night,
me and Taiga.

01:38.389 --> 01:39.432
Well, I did.

01:39.432 --> 01:41.184
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, uh...

01:41.184 --> 01:43.520
He came outta nowhere,
grabbed my phone.

01:45.605 --> 01:46.940
And jetted.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.109
And I took off running
after the bastard.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.527
Hey!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.112
- You chased him?
- Yeah.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.238
I didn't catch him.

01:53.238 --> 01:55.240
Oh, what, are you
Ben Johnson now?

01:55.240 --> 01:57.700
Without the 'roid-induced
jaundice, yeah.

01:57.700 --> 02:00.286
I-I-I didn't think,
I just ran.

02:02.038 --> 02:03.623
Guy must've been Usain Bolt.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.083
Well, you should go to <i>shul</i>
Friday night

02:05.083 --> 02:07.085
and do a quick <i>daven</i>
of thanks for that.

02:07.085 --> 02:08.294
No, I didn't catch him.

02:09.921 --> 02:11.089
Right. And if you had,

02:11.089 --> 02:12.382
what the hell would
you have done then?

02:12.382 --> 02:13.716
Tried to depose him?

02:16.177 --> 02:19.347
Well, I-I would have used brain,
brawn, whatever I had to.

02:19.347 --> 02:21.057
There were, uh...

02:21.057 --> 02:24.144
sensitive documents
on the phone.

02:24.144 --> 02:26.855
- From this office?
- Yes.

02:26.855 --> 02:28.106
Well, can't you erase the phone?

02:28.106 --> 02:29.607
Mm. Been trying. No luck.

02:29.607 --> 02:31.401
That's because the first thing
you do with a stolen phone

02:31.401 --> 02:34.821
is take it offline
so the owner can't wipe it.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.948
Then you swap the SIM card
into a clean phone

02:36.948 --> 02:40.118
and look for a social media
handle to ID the owner.

02:40.118 --> 02:43.872
Then you start working
on identify theft.

02:46.249 --> 02:49.794
Did you try your phone carrier?
Maybe they can wipe it.

02:49.794 --> 02:53.006
Uh, I called. They said it
could be 72 to 96 hours

02:53.006 --> 02:54.924
before they can clear
the data from the cloud.

02:54.924 --> 02:57.260
Well, let's just hope the perp
doesn't recognize you

02:57.260 --> 02:59.971
as a high-value target
before that happens.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.473
'Cause then he'll
really sift through the data,

03:02.473 --> 03:05.518
bundle it and sell it.

03:14.736 --> 03:18.198
Okay, my friend.
What's this really about?

03:18.198 --> 03:21.409
We're not exactly talking
Hillary's emails here, are we?

03:21.409 --> 03:24.495
No, I mean there's
some work emails...

03:24.495 --> 03:26.039
But...

03:26.039 --> 03:29.500
There is filmed material.

03:30.418 --> 03:32.378
Boudoir, in essence.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.506
Us. Me and Taiga
in the marital...

03:35.506 --> 03:38.927
Sex tapes,
I guess you'd call 'em.

03:38.927 --> 03:41.471
Homemade.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.097
It was Taiga's idea.

03:43.097 --> 03:46.392
She has no bad angles.
I'm all bad angles.

03:46.392 --> 03:47.602
How explicit are we talking?

03:47.602 --> 03:50.313
Very vanilla. But still.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.065
Vanilla.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.275
We did use a...

03:55.193 --> 03:57.987
um, whaddaya call it...

03:57.987 --> 04:02.242
a, uh... swing once.

04:08.498 --> 04:11.292
I can see that this isn't a time
you're going to handle jokes

04:11.292 --> 04:13.419
very well,
but boy, do I got 'em.

04:13.419 --> 04:15.922
You've gotta help me get
that fucking phone back, Chuck.

04:15.922 --> 04:19.259
Mm-hmm. Let me work.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.472
Lumen is on track to launch
homegrown silicon.

04:24.472 --> 04:25.556
We need to go big.

04:25.556 --> 04:27.141
Five hundred million
at a minimum.

04:27.141 --> 04:28.768
No. We're too heavy in tech. Next.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.979
Bartell. They're bringing
a local supply chain online

04:30.979 --> 04:32.438
- which gives them--
- How much we talking?

04:32.438 --> 04:34.899
We should go in for
three-quarters of a billion.

04:34.899 --> 04:37.944
- For what kind of return?
- 15 percent.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.404
- Too rich.
- And it'll take too long.

04:39.404 --> 04:41.322
Not worth the wait. Pass.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.827
Fifteen percent not worth it?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.788
Fuck.

04:51.416 --> 04:52.500
Rejection.

04:52.500 --> 04:54.294
The love language
of the trading floor.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.963
Reminds me of the old days,
before participation trophies.

04:56.963 --> 04:58.214
Next victim.

04:58.214 --> 05:01.175
The Wyndam Air Skyway merger
is a lock for reg approval.

05:01.175 --> 05:03.052
That's an equity value
of $12 billion.

05:03.052 --> 05:05.555
I can get us up to
a five percent stake before--

05:05.555 --> 05:06.973
Pass.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.941
Is that the number, 500 large,

05:16.941 --> 05:18.443
that's beyond
your approval range?

05:18.443 --> 05:20.361
After that, you have to go
to the principal's office

05:20.361 --> 05:22.322
for a hall pass?

05:22.322 --> 05:25.241
This all started when
the nuns gave up rulers

05:25.241 --> 05:26.367
for peace circles.

05:26.367 --> 05:28.494
Listen up,
you cosseted malcontents.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.122
The only crosstown traffic
in this office

05:31.122 --> 05:32.290
is the ask and the deliver.

05:32.290 --> 05:33.958
Know this:
real traders don't need

05:33.958 --> 05:37.128
the treasure of the Sierra Madre
to make fucking money!

05:37.128 --> 05:39.505
This meeting's over now.
Go back to your desks.

05:39.505 --> 05:43.092
And find some ideas
that are worth plunging in on.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.046
Nice draw you have there.

06:20.046 --> 06:21.381
You really fire
the hands through

06:21.381 --> 06:22.548
at just the right moment.

06:22.548 --> 06:25.551
Ah, the newly installed
US Attorney.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.220
- Care to knock a few?
- Oh, no, thank you,

06:27.220 --> 06:30.139
soon-to-be-installed
NYPD Commish, no, thank you.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.309
I've made it my life's mission
to not learn the game.

06:33.309 --> 06:36.270
My dad loves it
just a notch too much.

06:36.270 --> 06:37.814
Sure, like me and the streets.

06:37.814 --> 06:38.815
Mm.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.650
You know,
I was in a fancy office,

06:40.650 --> 06:42.402
playing three times a week,

06:42.402 --> 06:43.778
and yet I find
myself hanging up my clubs

06:43.778 --> 06:45.488
and returning to Police Plaza.

06:45.488 --> 06:47.156
So...

06:47.156 --> 06:48.324
What brings you here,

06:48.324 --> 06:49.951
instead of to my
welcome-aboard party?

06:49.951 --> 06:53.329
Don't think I haven't noticed
that you didn't RSVP.

06:53.329 --> 06:55.331
Having the US Attorney
for the Southern District there

06:55.331 --> 06:56.457
is an important look.

06:56.457 --> 07:00.294
Well, why RSVP
when you know I'll be there?

07:00.294 --> 07:02.713
So, what are you gonna
threaten me with, Chuck?

07:02.713 --> 07:04.507
I haven't even
started the job yet.

07:04.507 --> 07:06.050
Why would I do
something like that?

07:06.050 --> 07:09.637
It's your M.O.
And maybe your life's blood.

07:09.637 --> 07:12.098
In another life, maybe.

07:12.098 --> 07:14.308
It's true we have been
on opposite sides

07:14.308 --> 07:17.770
of things in the past,
but it's different now. I am.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.480
- If you say so.
- I do.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.023
And I am here in the spirit

07:21.023 --> 07:23.568
of working together
moving forward.

07:23.568 --> 07:25.528
Like I did
with your predecessor.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.697
What the hell
do you need, Chuck?

07:27.697 --> 07:29.699
CCTV database.

07:29.699 --> 07:32.994
Whoa. Oh, you don't
think small, I'll give you that.

07:32.994 --> 07:35.705
Especially if this is
where we're starting.

07:35.705 --> 07:38.249
It's for Ira Schirmer,
my deputy.

07:38.249 --> 07:41.169
He was burgled while promenading

07:41.169 --> 07:42.545
the boulevards
of our fine city--

07:42.545 --> 07:44.172
something that surely
won't be happening

07:44.172 --> 07:47.508
with as much regularity
under your tenure.

07:48.426 --> 07:51.762
And they got his phone,
and he needs it back.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.389
Not even my first day
on the job,

07:53.389 --> 07:56.267
and I'm gonna pull
CCTV footage for you

07:56.267 --> 07:57.810
because your buddy
lost his phone?

07:57.810 --> 08:00.730
Like I said, he's my deputy.

08:00.730 --> 08:04.025
And there are
SDNY documents on it

08:04.025 --> 08:06.652
that we would really prefer
to keep in-house.

08:06.652 --> 08:08.654
So, what you're asking for
is a favor.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.740
That would appear
to be the case.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.366
And how do you
envision it working?

08:12.366 --> 08:15.703
There certainly needs to be
a flow of amity

08:15.703 --> 08:17.663
between the federal prosecutor

08:17.663 --> 08:19.540
and the head of
local law enforcement.

08:19.540 --> 08:20.750
You and I would get into a flow.

08:20.750 --> 08:23.794
Oh, we can
roll through this town

08:23.794 --> 08:26.005
like Francis Albert
and Jilly Rizzo.

08:26.005 --> 08:28.090
And on the wings of
that romantic image,

08:28.090 --> 08:29.759
I should jeopardize
my new post

08:29.759 --> 08:33.471
and go chasing
shit down for you.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.266
Okay, I hate to say it,
at the risk of

08:37.266 --> 08:39.101
blowing this thing up any more,

08:39.101 --> 08:42.063
but if you need cover,
the stuff on that phone--

08:42.855 --> 08:46.943
national security implications.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.241
Okay, Chuck,
you had me at Jilly.

08:53.241 --> 08:54.659
I'm gonna look into this
for you.

08:54.659 --> 08:57.537
And I look forward to seeing
you at my kickoff party.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.206
I've already got
my suit picked out.

09:05.586 --> 09:07.463
This is untenable.
We are ready to make the descent

09:07.463 --> 09:10.091
at the Col d'Allos, and you put
training wheels on our bikes.

09:10.091 --> 09:11.425
We need the ability
to make moves.

09:11.425 --> 09:13.052
You are, whether you
like it or not,

09:13.052 --> 09:14.470
creating a choke point
to your own success.

09:14.470 --> 09:15.930
The whole floor
can see it clear.

09:15.930 --> 09:18.266
And I got bifocals? No.

09:18.266 --> 09:20.643
I built my first company
in a Bloomington garage.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.562
I had a flip phone
and three maxed-out

09:22.562 --> 09:23.813
credit cards for capital.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.565
Don't come in here
and complain about

09:25.565 --> 09:27.066
a $500 million ceiling.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.652
This isn't "I walked ten miles
uphill to school,

09:29.652 --> 09:31.028
both ways" time.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.905
Our interests are aligned,
Mike. This disrespect--

09:32.905 --> 09:35.116
I'd think you'd want us
using your

09:35.116 --> 09:36.450
unbridled belief in us
as rocket fuel,

09:36.450 --> 09:37.868
not jerking around
chasing approvals.

09:37.868 --> 09:40.162
If you want to wallow
in bruised ego,

09:40.162 --> 09:42.415
perhaps you should be
in Wendy's office, not Mike's.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.375
Because this man has done
more with less

09:44.375 --> 09:45.543
than either of you.

09:45.543 --> 09:47.503
What we want is
to do more with more.

09:47.503 --> 09:49.171
Want. Need.
Never the same thing.

09:49.171 --> 09:50.798
- You both should know that.
- This is a real problem,

09:50.798 --> 09:53.551
no matter how you try to
spin it. For us and the floor.

09:53.551 --> 09:57.430
A half-billion-dollar limit
is an inconvenience, at best.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.432
I'm always reachable.
And if I'm not,

09:59.432 --> 10:01.392
Scooter is authorized
to sign off in my place.

10:01.392 --> 10:02.518
I am!

10:02.518 --> 10:04.228
The only problem I see
is that the floor obviously

10:04.228 --> 10:05.688
has a big idea.
You two have wasted

10:05.688 --> 10:07.857
the last few minutes
not talking about it.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.734
So, do you have
something to tell me?

10:09.734 --> 10:12.528
We've got an early path to 5%
on the Wyndam merger.

10:12.528 --> 10:13.821
Good. Approval?

10:13.821 --> 10:16.365
- Green light coming.
- Done.

10:16.365 --> 10:18.242
Spyros will stop by
for the authorization.

10:18.242 --> 10:21.662
See, that worked even better
than I had imagined.

10:21.662 --> 10:23.706
You two not only get
your money

10:23.706 --> 10:26.917
but my enthusiastic support
for the deal.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.212
Anything else?

10:39.513 --> 10:42.600
X-ray vision is not one of
my superpowers.

10:42.600 --> 10:43.768
What do we got?

10:43.768 --> 10:46.687
I have... No, I think
I might have a problem,

10:46.687 --> 10:50.399
a personal one, that
may complicate some plans.

10:50.399 --> 10:52.026
Ah, that kind of folder.

10:52.026 --> 10:54.612
Is this the-the real
Dark and Dirty,

10:54.612 --> 10:56.906
or the garden variety oppo pack?

10:56.906 --> 10:57.907
There's always two.

10:57.907 --> 10:59.825
You're a professional, as am I.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.452
The D&D has been handled.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.162
Well, you're ahead of the game.

11:03.162 --> 11:05.164
Good thing. Runs for Congress
can be tricky.

11:05.164 --> 11:08.584
It's the, uh, unburied landmines
that get most first-timers.

11:08.584 --> 11:09.669
I'm not most.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.837
No, you're certainly not.

11:12.922 --> 11:15.383
Sorry. I don't open
anything for free.

11:16.676 --> 11:17.718
Noted.

11:17.718 --> 11:19.428
But I don't need
to open this one

11:19.428 --> 11:21.389
because if you're
asking my opinion,

11:21.389 --> 11:23.140
you've already determined
whatever's in there

11:23.140 --> 11:24.517
is a liability.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.686
Or, should I say,
whoever is in there.

11:26.686 --> 11:28.771
And, yes, he's a liability--

11:28.771 --> 11:30.773
your former colleague, Connerty.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.651
If you want a street magic levitation

11:33.651 --> 11:37.029
kind of reaction to that trick,
I'm not your audience.

11:37.822 --> 11:39.407
But I am impressed.

11:39.407 --> 11:42.034
Difference is
levitation ain't real.

11:42.034 --> 11:43.369
Similarity is.

11:43.369 --> 11:44.995
Creating the illusion
takes a ton of work.

11:44.995 --> 11:47.498
Before I signed on here,
I created liability charts

11:47.498 --> 11:49.542
for everyone in close prox
to the man.

11:49.542 --> 11:52.503
And, uh... this is yours.

11:52.503 --> 11:55.297
Do I deal with it ahead,

11:55.297 --> 11:59.969
even with the risks inherent
in that approach?

11:59.969 --> 12:02.763
In politics, there's only
too late and too soon.

12:02.763 --> 12:04.390
And no one sitting on the Hill

12:04.390 --> 12:07.309
has ever regretted
acting too soon.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.109
Ben Kim, excellent work
on the merger. Make it happen.

12:15.109 --> 12:16.402
I thought you said--

12:16.402 --> 12:17.945
We've decided to move ahead.

12:17.945 --> 12:19.280
You decided?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.907
Should we speak more slowly?
Will that help?

12:24.118 --> 12:26.912
What the fuck?

12:26.912 --> 12:28.414
My bad.

12:28.414 --> 12:31.792
Whitestone was
a goddamn parking lot.

12:31.792 --> 12:33.502
What?

12:34.503 --> 12:35.838
Oh, these?

12:35.838 --> 12:37.423
Uh, niece's
birthday party yesterday.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.926
Every shop in Danbury was either
sold out or rationing helium.

12:40.926 --> 12:42.762
Had to go to fucking Queens.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.972
Time I finally got these,
party was over.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.100
Kids.

12:48.976 --> 12:52.188
So, my gift to you.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.939
Mm!

13:03.616 --> 13:05.242
How many fucking Party Citys

13:05.242 --> 13:06.660
did you have to go to?

13:06.660 --> 13:08.412
All of them.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.706
In the hours I spent in line

13:10.706 --> 13:12.500
behind sugared-up
5-year-olds,

13:12.500 --> 13:14.543
I was able to reflect
on my mistakes in the past.

13:14.543 --> 13:17.838
Like Solzhenitsyn, revisiting
the ways it could have gone.

13:17.838 --> 13:20.382
Pass the dutchie somewhere else.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.094
<i>The Gulag Archipelago.</i>

13:24.094 --> 13:26.806
About the journey of a <i>zek</i>--
a prisoner--

13:26.806 --> 13:30.309
from arrest, to show trial,
to internment in a labor camp

13:30.309 --> 13:32.520
where he's supposed to learn
about the error of his ways.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.980
Oh, like being sent to Siberia.

13:34.980 --> 13:40.152
Yeah. Siberia. That's where
they put Solzhenitsyn.

13:40.152 --> 13:41.987
Well, unlike him,

13:41.987 --> 13:45.199
I came out with a way in
on Titan Industries.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.409
What's the idea?

13:47.409 --> 13:50.621
Helium shortage is about
to get much worse, worldwide.

13:50.621 --> 13:52.581
Titan is the only company

13:52.581 --> 13:54.959
that's gonna be able
to fulfill its helium contracts

13:54.959 --> 13:56.877
after the first of the month.

13:56.877 --> 14:00.172
I get us in with half a million
shares now,

14:00.172 --> 14:02.758
we can turn a 10X profit.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.468
Do it.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.054
So, we should visit these states

14:07.054 --> 14:09.807
sometime
over the next few months.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.058
- We're all set.
- Excellent.

14:11.058 --> 14:12.977
This is the listening party

14:12.977 --> 14:14.895
for the new
Killer Mike album, right?

14:14.895 --> 14:16.480
So, to review the bidding,

14:16.480 --> 14:17.857
do not ask him
for an endorsement.

14:17.857 --> 14:19.859
Right. But if he introduces
the conversation...

14:19.859 --> 14:21.110
Still dangerous waters.

14:21.110 --> 14:22.486
I can steer a kayak.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.988
Mike once came second
in the Nile River

14:23.988 --> 14:26.740
Whitewater Competition
shooting the White Nile rapids.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.410
Difference being, you capsize
there, you whip back up.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.120
In this game,
you get turned upside down.

14:31.120 --> 14:34.623
Absolutely. As we have agreed.
I know the consequences.

14:34.623 --> 14:36.333
But this is a private event,
no press,

14:36.333 --> 14:37.543
so there are no optics.

14:37.543 --> 14:38.794
Uh, just keep it personal.

14:38.794 --> 14:40.588
If Mike floats the possibility
of an endorsement,

14:40.588 --> 14:42.631
just kind of nod and bring it
back to me to sort out.

14:42.631 --> 14:45.551
I hadn't even thought
of his endorsement. You?

14:45.551 --> 14:46.886
No. Hadn't crossed my mind.

14:46.886 --> 14:49.889
Mm. But since you rolled
the balls out, let's play.

14:49.889 --> 14:51.432
Say I was considering it.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.225
It's something that
needs to be negotiated

14:53.225 --> 14:54.768
like the Potsdam Conference.

14:54.768 --> 14:56.770
Otherwise, you're opening
yourself up to look weak if he--

14:56.770 --> 14:58.564
Refuses to endorse me after all?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.024
- Yes.
- Well, that is a risk.

15:00.024 --> 15:03.402
Should we not go?
Maybe we shouldn't go.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.239
Guys, I know you're still going.

15:11.410 --> 15:15.122
Oh, and don't let anyone get
a pic of you huffing grass.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.800
I'm coming to you humble.

15:26.800 --> 15:27.801
Not possible.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.845
Just the walking in here
proves it.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.640
I didn't anticipate
asking for your help.

15:32.640 --> 15:34.308
Funny. I did.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.976
Hm. You would.

15:35.976 --> 15:37.937
Should I put on
the Dead Can Dance or--

15:37.937 --> 15:40.314
I see that even as Prince
takes my counsel,

15:40.314 --> 15:41.941
it doesn't sit easy with him.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.984
My normal guys are so used
to being second-guessed.

15:43.984 --> 15:46.278
Comes with the gig.
This guy, though--

15:46.278 --> 15:47.863
Yeah. Not pliable, I told you.

15:47.863 --> 15:50.824
But somehow,
you are able to bend him.

15:50.824 --> 15:52.117
Can you spare a few minutes?

15:52.117 --> 15:54.954
I'm coming to you,
as I say, humble.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.497
No, you're not.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.207
They didn't program that
into the factory model

15:58.207 --> 16:00.167
when they fabricated you.
But sure.

16:00.167 --> 16:04.171
I... I appreciate
the approximation of it.

16:06.548 --> 16:08.550
But this isn't
a "few minutes" conversation.

16:08.550 --> 16:11.470
- I'll buy you dinner.
- Where?

16:12.471 --> 16:13.973
Um...

16:13.973 --> 16:16.433
Jesus, Prince really
does have you rattled.

16:17.726 --> 16:20.104
Okay. I got it.

16:25.734 --> 16:28.237
This is Wendy Rhoades.

16:28.237 --> 16:32.032
7:30. Two. A quiet table.

16:44.253 --> 16:46.797
Dave. Always a pleasure.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.298
What brings you
to Federal climes?

16:48.298 --> 16:49.383
Did you just miss me?

16:49.383 --> 16:51.927
In the spirit of
a new beginning,

16:51.927 --> 16:53.303
a peace offering.

16:53.303 --> 16:54.930
I was going to bring
you a Montblanc,

16:54.930 --> 16:58.183
but they say
know your audience, right?

16:59.518 --> 17:01.854
I will admit,
it's nice seeing you here.

17:01.854 --> 17:03.397
It's where you belong.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.983
Like Teddy Roosevelt astride
his favorite mount, Bleistein.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.235
Fine gelding, no doubt.

17:08.235 --> 17:11.697
Now... you want something, yes?

17:11.697 --> 17:15.659
I know when last we met, you
weren't quite so transactional.

17:15.659 --> 17:18.912
I was listening to a lot
of John Lennon back then.

17:18.912 --> 17:20.581
But soundtrack's changed.

17:20.581 --> 17:24.043
Look, you're gonna
make a case against Prince,

17:24.043 --> 17:25.919
and I want to participate.

17:25.919 --> 17:28.756
I can be helpful
in so many ways,

17:28.756 --> 17:30.841
as I have been before.

17:30.841 --> 17:33.385
Mm. You brought pie.

17:33.385 --> 17:36.430
Uh, what else can you do?

17:36.430 --> 17:39.808
I know!
You could double-cross me

17:39.808 --> 17:42.227
if you see an angle
to set up a triple cross

17:42.227 --> 17:43.270
on someone else.

17:43.270 --> 17:45.773
Right.
Been there, done that.

17:45.773 --> 17:47.775
No such move
comes to mind this time.

17:47.775 --> 17:50.986
It's just that
with your federal resources,

17:50.986 --> 17:53.280
you can bring a much
stronger case than I can.

17:53.280 --> 17:56.408
But, I'm the strongest
trial lawyer you know.

17:56.408 --> 17:57.826
We can muddle through here.

17:57.826 --> 18:00.287
We both know you can
go after Prince alone,

18:00.287 --> 18:01.914
Wild Style, but...

18:01.914 --> 18:03.874
the minute you get
something on him,

18:03.874 --> 18:06.251
everyone from
Pennsylvania Avenue down

18:06.251 --> 18:08.837
is coming to grab
a share of the spoils.

18:08.837 --> 18:10.714
Mm-hmm.
But not you.

18:10.714 --> 18:13.258
Look. Think of me
as a prairie homesteader.

18:13.258 --> 18:17.721
I'm willing to help till
the soil before winter comes.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.807
We hit Prince together,
divvy up the bounty

18:19.807 --> 18:21.683
between state
and federal charges, in case--

18:21.683 --> 18:24.186
In case what? I bring
something that doesn't stick?

18:24.186 --> 18:25.854
- Won't happen.
- It could!

18:25.854 --> 18:27.314
Not to me.

18:27.314 --> 18:29.817
Is this about stopping Prince,

18:29.817 --> 18:32.903
or about you stopping Prince?

18:32.903 --> 18:35.739
I could ask you the very same.

18:35.739 --> 18:37.199
We can get this guy together.

18:37.199 --> 18:40.327
We tried that.
Remember?

18:40.327 --> 18:42.913
Your plan. Your rules.

18:42.913 --> 18:46.291
Until it was your plan,
your rules.

18:46.291 --> 18:50.462
So... we do it together,
for real.

18:51.588 --> 18:53.173
Think about it.

18:53.173 --> 18:54.842
Already am.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.010
Enjoy the dessert.

18:57.010 --> 19:00.139
Was a time
I'd've taken this pie

19:00.139 --> 19:02.808
and cleared my afternoon.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.810
I'll see you out.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.940
Attention, please!

19:09.940 --> 19:12.734
The best sweet potato pie
in the city,

19:12.734 --> 19:15.445
courtesy of the New York AG.

19:21.326 --> 19:23.579
Thanks a lot.

19:23.579 --> 19:26.748
It's his firm.
His money. His guidelines.

19:26.748 --> 19:28.333
Why would he cede
that kind of control to you?

19:28.333 --> 19:30.127
Because he asked us
to take the rudder.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.421
How many times have you seen
<i>The Hunt for Red October?</i>

19:32.421 --> 19:33.839
I don't watch Alec--

19:33.839 --> 19:35.632
Yeah, and Connery
had that interview back in--

19:35.632 --> 19:37.009
Okay, I hear you, but let's
not with that, right now.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.677
I asked rhetorically.

19:38.677 --> 19:41.972
I'm sure you both know
lines by heart. The point is:

19:41.972 --> 19:43.182
even Ramius,

19:43.182 --> 19:47.144
who had almost total
discretion, couldn't act alone.

19:47.144 --> 19:49.146
Someone had to give him
the keys every time

19:49.146 --> 19:50.314
he took out that sub.

19:50.314 --> 19:52.065
Is Ramius...?

19:52.065 --> 19:53.483
Two captains in this story.

19:53.483 --> 19:55.652
The point is,
if you're asking for total

19:55.652 --> 19:58.030
and complete control 24/7,
you are wasting your time.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.031
And his.

19:59.031 --> 20:00.490
Well, we got that memo.

20:00.490 --> 20:02.409
Let's pretend,
for argument's sake,

20:02.409 --> 20:03.952
that I have seen <i>Hunt.</i>

20:03.952 --> 20:05.787
Once the high command
becomes unreachable,

20:05.787 --> 20:08.832
it is up to the captains to make
the best call they see fit.

20:08.832 --> 20:10.626
Chain of command
is fine in dry dock,

20:10.626 --> 20:12.544
but when you're at 200 fathoms
and the missiles start firing,

20:12.544 --> 20:15.881
you've got to have
the leeway to act.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.300
And now you have
your argument for Prince.

20:21.136 --> 20:24.765
For the record,
I bleed <i>Crimson Tide.</i>

20:24.765 --> 20:27.768
Still comes down to judgment
and who should be in command.

20:27.768 --> 20:29.436
Yeah.

20:30.270 --> 20:31.772
I get it.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.240
When I asked you before
for your help,

20:41.240 --> 20:43.909
you said you wanted to
stay above the fray.

20:43.909 --> 20:45.327
You know I'm sympathetic
to the cause.

20:45.327 --> 20:46.995
I hopped on a plane
to England with you.

20:46.995 --> 20:49.998
But I need to know exactly
what I'd be helping.

20:49.998 --> 20:51.667
Do you have a plan?
More allies?

20:51.667 --> 20:53.543
Are you prepared
for the aftermath?

20:53.543 --> 20:56.880
- Working on it.
- So, no, you have nothing.

20:57.839 --> 21:00.217
It seems that above
is the right place to be

21:00.217 --> 21:03.845
when the fray
is all questions, no answers.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.399
The helium play. Where are we?

21:15.399 --> 21:18.402
Sitting as pretty
as Jennifer Beals

21:18.402 --> 21:19.611
holding the blowtorch.

21:19.611 --> 21:21.238
If we're as locked in
as you say,

21:21.238 --> 21:23.073
are you sure no other fund
is piggybacking off of us?

21:23.073 --> 21:27.327
I cover my tracks.
Like always. We're good.

21:27.327 --> 21:28.996
Grand.

21:44.886 --> 21:48.098
Dollar Bill's research is solid
and surprisingly aboveboard.

21:48.098 --> 21:51.059
Yeah? Okay, trying
to wrap my head around that.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.352
But we're missing something.

21:52.352 --> 21:54.604
There's an opportunity out there
to make this bigger.

21:54.604 --> 21:57.149
- Find it.
- When you say bigger,

21:57.149 --> 21:58.775
is there a number
I should be aware--

21:58.775 --> 22:00.110
Go there.

22:00.110 --> 22:02.612
And then bring it to me.
And then I'll figure it out.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.809
Phones please, gentlemen.

22:44.821 --> 22:47.699
Welcome. Follow me.

23:05.759 --> 23:08.512
What's up, everybody.

23:08.512 --> 23:11.431
Mike. Scooter,
what's up, brother?

23:11.431 --> 23:14.351
I wanna appreciate
everybody for coming.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.478
Been working really hard
on some dope shit.

23:16.478 --> 23:18.397
I hope y'all are ready for it.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.148
For this? Always.

23:20.148 --> 23:21.566
My man.

23:41.420 --> 23:43.922
<i>You did nice work
with the helium play.</i>

23:43.922 --> 23:46.007
Nimble. Aggressive.
Precisely the kind of thinking

23:46.007 --> 23:48.635
best suited to our
current leadership structure.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.678
Why I'm here.

23:49.678 --> 23:52.222
Here's how we make
some real money.

23:52.222 --> 23:53.432
We found a start-up with

23:53.432 --> 23:55.725
breakthrough
helium extraction tech.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.227
The company
goes public this week,

23:57.227 --> 23:58.603
and the IPO is going to pop.

23:58.603 --> 24:01.606
We've got Spartan-Ives
holding a slot for us.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.735
- But?
- The buy-in is 634 million.

24:05.735 --> 24:07.904
No splits, no partnering
with other funds.

24:07.904 --> 24:09.739
And Spartan-Ives is only
holding the slot for an hour

24:09.739 --> 24:11.324
before they offer it
to someone else.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.869
- President Prince--
- Don't call him that.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.662
Prince the POTUS, then,

24:15.662 --> 24:17.414
has asked, in his absence,

24:17.414 --> 24:19.833
for me to keep
my ear to the rail

24:19.833 --> 24:24.337
for any tattle
regarding sizing.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.465
Said I should be
his size king.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.800
Are you sure
that's the phrase he used?

24:31.303 --> 24:32.471
You don't think I can handle it?

24:32.471 --> 24:34.723
No, no, suppose you can.

24:34.723 --> 24:37.100
No investment
over five hundred million

24:37.100 --> 24:38.810
- without prior approval.
- No secrets here.

24:38.810 --> 24:41.146
We were just calling him
to get exactly that.

24:42.564 --> 24:43.982
I'll wait.

24:46.693 --> 24:50.113
<i>I'll wait
Till your love comes back</i>

24:50.113 --> 24:51.615
Peach, we need
to reach Prince, ASAP.

24:51.615 --> 24:53.283
<i>One second.</i>

24:53.283 --> 24:56.119
<i>I'm coming straight
For your heart</i>

24:56.119 --> 24:59.372
<i>No way you can stop me now</i>

24:59.372 --> 25:00.540
Stop singing.

25:00.540 --> 25:04.461
<i>As fine as you are</i>

25:04.461 --> 25:06.588
Fooh.

25:06.588 --> 25:08.507
His line's going
straight to voicemail.

25:08.507 --> 25:09.466
And Scooter?

25:09.466 --> 25:12.594
Same thing.
Sorry. I'll keep trying.

25:18.808 --> 25:20.435
Looks like we're on hold.

25:20.435 --> 25:25.357
<i>I'll wait till
Your love comes down</i>

25:25.357 --> 25:30.111
<i>I'm coming straight
For your heart</i>

25:31.279 --> 25:32.280
They caught him.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.824
I just heard.
The magic of CCTV.

25:34.824 --> 25:36.243
- Yeah.
- You're welcome.

25:36.368 --> 25:39.663
Um, when I went to the precinct
to get the phone,

25:39.663 --> 25:41.081
they wouldn't release it.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.499
Why not?

25:42.499 --> 25:44.167
Desk sergeant said
the word from on high

25:44.167 --> 25:46.503
is the phone is now evidence
in some security matter.

25:46.503 --> 25:50.048
Beyond the theft, I mean,
why would some ema--

25:51.299 --> 25:52.884
What'd you do, Chuck?

25:57.264 --> 25:59.558
I had to tell him something
to get him to focus,

25:59.558 --> 26:01.768
so I might've embellished
the importance.

26:01.768 --> 26:03.603
What'd you say?

26:03.603 --> 26:05.939
National security implications.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.442
Christ.

26:09.442 --> 26:11.945
I told him I'd be
at his kick-off party.

26:11.945 --> 26:13.280
Now I have an agenda.

26:13.280 --> 26:14.614
All right, I'm coming with.

26:14.614 --> 26:17.242
No, buddy. You never
negotiate for a hostage

26:17.242 --> 26:19.327
when it's a member
of your own family.

26:19.327 --> 26:22.163
All objectivity is gone.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.208
What I need gone
is those videos.

26:25.208 --> 26:26.835
Taiga is busted up over this.

26:26.835 --> 26:29.004
She's looking at houses
in Delaware.

26:29.004 --> 26:32.549
I need that phone, brother,
or I might never have sex again.

26:32.549 --> 26:35.802
That's a problem.
But it ain't my problem.

26:38.680 --> 26:41.850
Don't worry, I-man, I got ya.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.856
Still going to voicemail.

26:47.856 --> 26:49.899
If we can't raise Prince
or Scooter somehow--

26:49.899 --> 26:51.651
She knows where he is.

26:58.158 --> 26:59.743
We need to locate
Prince and Scooter.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.287
- They're out of the office.
- Office.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.622
Yeah, so you said.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.458
How would you like
an all-expenses paid trip

27:06.458 --> 27:08.543
to Bermuda to tell us where?

27:08.543 --> 27:11.046
I'd like to keep my job

27:11.046 --> 27:13.548
and my integrity more.

27:13.548 --> 27:15.592
Bad call!

27:17.802 --> 27:19.346
Girl's got no judgement.

27:19.346 --> 27:22.349
Girl's got mad <i>cojones,</i>
is what she's got.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.475
That's Spanish.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.644
This is going to be
a lost opportunity

27:25.644 --> 27:27.354
on the scale of Russia
selling us Alaska

27:27.354 --> 27:28.938
- for seven mill.
- Seward's folly.

27:28.938 --> 27:30.273
Like I said, yep.

27:30.273 --> 27:31.816
This one'll be called
Prince's folly.

27:31.816 --> 27:36.071
Yeah. Only we're the ones
that are really gonna lose.

27:40.283 --> 27:43.203
Been working my socials to find
a way to get to Killer Mike,

27:43.203 --> 27:45.330
but no one I know has
an in with the big man.

27:45.330 --> 27:47.332
Shocking you don't run
in the same circles.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.584
It is disappointing.

27:49.584 --> 27:51.961
I got us some time.
Extra hour.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.132
I can be very persuasive.

27:56.132 --> 27:58.134
Amen, brother.

27:58.134 --> 27:59.803
The total investment
is hovering around 600.

27:59.803 --> 28:00.970
Can you sign off on that?

28:00.970 --> 28:03.306
Sadly, I cannot.
Hands are tied.

28:06.559 --> 28:09.813
What about you?
Special circumstances.

28:12.565 --> 28:15.318
I am astonished
to see you in Baghdad,

28:16.569 --> 28:20.949
for I have an appointment
with you tonight in Samarra.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.749
Spyros rides a pale horse.

28:29.749 --> 28:33.420
He really has a douchey way
of saying no.

28:33.420 --> 28:35.714
It's impressive.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.972
<i>Do I want you</i>

28:43.972 --> 28:48.309
<i>Oh my, do I...</i>

28:54.441 --> 28:57.235
- Oh.
- How are you?

29:01.030 --> 29:02.240
Enjoy.

29:13.793 --> 29:15.587
He was trying to get
a gold medal.

29:15.587 --> 29:16.963
Oh, come on!

29:16.963 --> 29:18.590
That can't be real.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.259
That's wild.

29:24.804 --> 29:26.473
We were just reviewing evidence.

29:26.473 --> 29:29.142
Mm-hmm. Can't be evidence
if it's a party game.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.060
Come on, gimme the phone.

29:31.060 --> 29:35.523
I would, but, uh,
NYAG has custody.

29:35.523 --> 29:37.817
Literally, in this case.

29:37.817 --> 29:39.986
You said there were
work documents on this.

29:39.986 --> 29:41.529
I need it to help
build the case.

29:41.529 --> 29:43.615
It's a state matter,
not federal.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.783
Ah!

29:44.783 --> 29:46.576
A topic of much debate.

29:46.576 --> 29:48.578
Not so much.
There's plenty of case law--

29:48.578 --> 29:51.080
She's got you there.

29:51.080 --> 29:52.999
Okay, Dave, very good.

29:52.999 --> 29:55.752
Very good. How do we
make this right, for Ira?

29:55.752 --> 30:00.089
Don't know. The compromise of
sensitive DOJ correspondence

30:00.089 --> 30:01.883
is a very serious matter.

30:01.883 --> 30:03.092
You're running with this?

30:03.092 --> 30:05.053
Oh, I've already gotten
an injunction

30:05.053 --> 30:07.972
forcing the phone company
to disable remote access.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.682
- Uh-huh.
- You should tell Ira

30:09.682 --> 30:11.309
to stop trying Find My Phone.

30:11.309 --> 30:16.064
What he should do instead
is freshen up his resumé.

30:20.735 --> 30:22.403
Because with this kind of scandal,

30:22.403 --> 30:25.114
this kind of <i>kompromat</i> hanging
over the Southern District,

30:25.114 --> 30:28.034
your deputy's gonna
have to resign.

30:28.034 --> 30:30.954
Uh, look, this is all
a big misunderstanding.

30:30.954 --> 30:32.497
- Okay.
- No, I got this.

30:32.497 --> 30:34.707
I-if we can just resolve this,

30:34.707 --> 30:37.919
I will be the best friend
you've ever had at Southern.

30:37.919 --> 30:39.087
I thought that was you, Chuck.

30:39.254 --> 30:41.840
This isn't Chuck's
fault, okay. I lied.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.924
- Ira--
- To your best friend?

30:42.924 --> 30:44.759
A federal official, no less?

30:44.759 --> 30:47.136
There's no SDNY material
on the phone, okay?

30:47.136 --> 30:48.888
A couple of emails
about softball league.

30:48.888 --> 30:50.431
- Say no more.
- I told Chuck

30:50.431 --> 30:53.142
there were work documents
on the phone because...

30:53.142 --> 30:55.812
All right,
I'm here to come clean.

30:55.812 --> 30:59.107
There are some
personal videos on there.

30:59.107 --> 31:01.067
It's very vanilla.

31:02.485 --> 31:05.905
I would say more, uh,
like fudge ripple,

31:05.905 --> 31:06.990
in my opinion.

31:06.990 --> 31:09.534
Looks to me
more like Rocky Road.

31:09.534 --> 31:13.037
'Cause nuts were
definitely an ingredient.

31:14.080 --> 31:17.792
Sounds like 31 Flavors
with a cherry on top.

31:20.837 --> 31:22.046
Oh!

31:22.046 --> 31:25.300
<i>- Et tu,</i> Chuck?
- Oh.

31:25.300 --> 31:28.428
I didn't watch it.

31:28.428 --> 31:31.014
Look, I know this is
tough for you, buddy.

31:31.014 --> 31:33.892
But right now,
the best thing you can do

31:33.892 --> 31:36.561
for yourself and Taiga
is go home,

31:36.561 --> 31:38.771
pour yourself
a nice single malt,

31:38.771 --> 31:42.191
and let me handle it
from here.

31:52.619 --> 31:55.079
Happy to chop it up
with humans trying to do good

31:55.079 --> 31:56.539
within their own
personal prisms.

31:56.539 --> 31:58.041
But before we go
further, know this:

31:58.041 --> 32:00.501
if it doesn't fit
my personal prism,

32:00.501 --> 32:03.004
there's no way I can
get behind it or endorse it.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.172
That's why I'm here.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.673
We've got a lot in common.

32:05.673 --> 32:07.800
We're both compassionate capitalists,

32:07.800 --> 32:09.135
raised in the belief that
making money

32:09.135 --> 32:10.678
requires you to do good.

32:10.678 --> 32:12.639
You ain't gotta go the common
ground angle, Mike.

32:12.639 --> 32:14.015
I mean,
we're radically different.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.059
I'm a Southerner,
I like muscle cars,

32:16.059 --> 32:18.853
strip clubs,
shooting at shit in the woods.

32:18.853 --> 32:20.438
Fortunately,
it's not about me.

32:20.438 --> 32:22.357
I just want to do something
better for my community.

32:22.357 --> 32:23.316
What do you want?

32:23.316 --> 32:25.568
I want Black banks to flourish.

32:25.568 --> 32:27.570
And I want them to flourish
in underserved communities.

32:27.570 --> 32:30.073
I understand the historical
and systemic injustices

32:30.073 --> 32:31.699
in the financial arena.

32:31.699 --> 32:34.619
As president, I'd be happy
to direct federal funds

32:34.619 --> 32:37.664
to support the infrastructure
of Black banks.

32:37.664 --> 32:39.374
That didn't work
with the Freedmen's Bureau.

32:39.374 --> 32:40.875
I'm not looking for charity.

32:40.875 --> 32:43.002
I can give you
five Black banks in Atlanta,

32:43.002 --> 32:44.671
from Citizen's Trust
to Greenwood,

32:44.671 --> 32:46.965
that all performed better
at net-interest margins

32:46.965 --> 32:48.549
than most banks nationally.

32:48.549 --> 32:50.843
It's not that they're unsound,
they're just stigmatized.

32:50.843 --> 32:53.137
Which is worse.

32:53.137 --> 32:54.555
How can I help?

32:54.555 --> 32:56.391
By putting your
personal money in those banks.

32:56.391 --> 32:58.643
Validation from
Mike Prince money

32:58.643 --> 33:01.604
makes those banks
instantly attractive.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.022
It's bold. Shows leadership.

33:03.022 --> 33:05.733
That you're not going to wait
for Congress to pass legislation

33:05.733 --> 33:09.946
watered down by interest groups
by the time it comes to a vote.

33:11.239 --> 33:14.075
Done. I'll endorse your banks.

33:14.075 --> 33:16.077
I'll move $100 million
by the end of the week,

33:16.077 --> 33:19.539
and you can expect a bigger
investment down the line.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.583
Then you can expect
my endorsement down the line.

33:28.256 --> 33:31.009
Smoke one?
Seal the deal?

33:34.303 --> 33:36.556
We're gonna have to pass.

33:45.982 --> 33:47.692
Was it them?

33:53.906 --> 33:57.702
No. It's over. Spartan-Ives
gave our slot to another fund.

35:32.922 --> 35:35.341
- Hey, Pete, can you--?
- Yeah.

35:38.761 --> 35:40.555
You didn't finish
your lobster tail.

35:40.555 --> 35:42.890
We sure that's what it was?

35:42.890 --> 35:45.643
I wasn't aware of
your culinary skills.

35:45.643 --> 35:46.936
Impressive.

35:46.936 --> 35:48.146
It's how I kept money
in my pocket

35:48.146 --> 35:49.438
on summers off from Fordham.

35:49.438 --> 35:52.233
Now it's more
of a full-time thing.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.276
I'm sorry.

35:53.276 --> 35:54.944
No, you're not.
I know why you're here.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.988
- You're finally going to run.
- It's my time.

35:56.988 --> 36:00.783
Seems like it always was.

36:00.783 --> 36:02.034
And now you want to know

36:02.034 --> 36:03.661
if I'm going to be
a liability for you.

36:03.661 --> 36:06.873
Or have I been upgraded
to an actual problem?

36:06.873 --> 36:09.208
When I make a move, I prefer
the base path to be clear.

36:09.208 --> 36:12.170
If I wanted to fuck you over,
I-I would've done it already.

36:12.170 --> 36:13.796
You wouldn't have
done it inside

36:13.796 --> 36:15.339
'cause you know I can
still pull levers in there.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.216
Like you did to get me
to the front of the line

36:17.216 --> 36:18.467
for discharge
to the halfway house.

36:18.467 --> 36:20.595
- Thank you.
- Sure.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.722
But now that you're out,

36:22.722 --> 36:24.307
breathing the sweet,
sweet air of freedom,

36:24.307 --> 36:26.851
you may be thinking
you can go all Chris Shiherlis

36:26.851 --> 36:28.895
and rock-and-roll
at the drop of a hat.

36:28.895 --> 36:31.063
- Don't.
- Or what, you violate me,

36:31.063 --> 36:32.231
have a judge put me back in?

36:32.231 --> 36:34.066
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:34.066 --> 36:37.361
But also, your brother operates
a forklift at a company owned

36:37.361 --> 36:39.030
by a company
owned by Mike Prince.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.531
I've recently learned that

36:40.531 --> 36:42.033
some of the items
from the warehouse

36:42.033 --> 36:43.701
may have found their way
into Jackie's house.

36:44.869 --> 36:46.495
You slip up,
say my name in public,

36:46.495 --> 36:48.831
a raid will occur,
one that will result in

36:48.831 --> 36:50.499
a number of
parole violations.

36:50.499 --> 36:53.044
Yeah, sure. I get it.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.213
As good as
I ever become with a knife,

36:55.213 --> 36:58.216
I'll never be able
to cut like you, Kate.

37:01.594 --> 37:02.803
So...

37:02.803 --> 37:05.056
you've got me boxed up
like supermarket sushi.

37:05.056 --> 37:07.975
And maybe that'll help you
sleep at night. Sort of.

37:07.975 --> 37:09.602
But I have a different vision.

37:09.602 --> 37:11.437
Dying to hear it.

37:11.437 --> 37:12.980
Make a friend of me,

37:12.980 --> 37:15.858
and instead of a liability,
you'll have an ally for life.

37:15.858 --> 37:18.069
Talk about sleeping
like a baby.

37:18.069 --> 37:19.237
Uh-huh.

37:19.237 --> 37:21.322
And how does this nifty picture
come together?

37:21.322 --> 37:23.908
Help me get
my law license back.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.244
Not easy.

37:26.244 --> 37:27.411
Brutal, in fact.

37:27.411 --> 37:29.038
Yeah, but that's your
specialty. You do that,

37:29.038 --> 37:31.874
I sail off into
corporate law or M & A,

37:31.874 --> 37:35.503
and I stay out of your sandbox
unless you need me.

37:35.503 --> 37:38.673
Something like that
will take a good while.

37:40.049 --> 37:42.468
Well, until then,

37:42.468 --> 37:44.553
you can find me
behind the <i>teppan,</i>

37:44.553 --> 37:49.100
biding my time
with my mouth shut.

37:49.100 --> 37:50.768
Hm.

38:01.362 --> 38:02.905
Well played.

38:02.905 --> 38:04.073
It's nice to see your time

38:04.073 --> 38:05.616
working for me wasn't wasted.

38:05.616 --> 38:07.368
You knew I could make moves.

38:07.368 --> 38:09.036
That's why you hired me.

38:09.036 --> 38:12.290
But doing it in front of your
friends and colleagues, sure,

38:12.290 --> 38:15.293
that is a page out of your book.

38:15.293 --> 38:19.005
Okay, you have
what I want. So...

38:19.005 --> 38:20.047
let's haggle.

38:20.047 --> 38:22.049
You took away
my shot to go after Prince

38:22.049 --> 38:23.926
and made my office look bad
while doing it.

38:23.926 --> 38:27.972
And so, I will kick some
important case from my office

38:27.972 --> 38:30.433
to yours,
a nice, juicy federal one

38:30.433 --> 38:31.976
that has some state jurisdiction

38:31.976 --> 38:34.103
and will put
the luster back on you.

38:34.103 --> 38:37.315
Not "some" case. Prince.

38:37.315 --> 38:41.068
No, no, that is my very
own ship in a bottle.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.321
It's a solo project
I'm building on my own.

38:43.321 --> 38:47.491
Then I'll keep this
and pursue it on my own.

38:47.491 --> 38:51.704
And at some point,
it's gonna leak.

38:51.704 --> 38:54.707
I won't do it.
I won't have to.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.292
It'll just happen.

38:56.292 --> 38:59.545
It'll start out
on <i>TMZ</i> or <i>Page Six,</i>

38:59.545 --> 39:02.506
but eventually
it'll find its way

39:02.506 --> 39:04.884
to Reddit and Pornhub.

39:06.510 --> 39:11.307
Fine. I will keep you involved
in all matters Prince.

39:11.307 --> 39:13.934
Involved is for the gals
in the Junior League.

39:13.934 --> 39:15.561
No, you're going
to make me first chair--

39:15.561 --> 39:18.147
Special Assistant
United States Attorney--

39:18.147 --> 39:21.359
to any federal prosecution
of Prince.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.402
So, you get to run the show?

39:23.402 --> 39:25.529
Sharing is caring.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.698
You want to save
your friend's pasty ass?

39:27.698 --> 39:29.533
It's your call.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.755
Is it too late?

39:42.755 --> 39:44.090
It is.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.508
How much did we leave
on the table?

39:45.508 --> 39:46.842
Besides hearts and guts?

39:46.842 --> 39:48.511
How much?

39:48.511 --> 39:50.846
Projections are, by the time
the company is mature--

39:50.846 --> 39:52.848
1.4 billion.

39:59.522 --> 40:03.567
- Next time.
- There won't be a next time.

40:04.485 --> 40:06.362
It can't be.

40:07.571 --> 40:11.033
I had this system built right
for living my life before.

40:11.033 --> 40:14.662
But now, doing what I'm doing,
with my run--

40:14.662 --> 40:16.080
Wags, you have full sign-off

40:16.080 --> 40:17.498
if Scooter and I are unavailable.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.835
And don't come calling
with bullshit, or I promise,

40:20.835 --> 40:23.129
the answer will be no.

40:23.129 --> 40:25.423
I want you all
to remember this feeling.

40:25.423 --> 40:26.715
Losing.

40:27.800 --> 40:29.718
You can choose to believe
this one is on me,

40:29.718 --> 40:31.679
but understand, if it
was me in your shoes,

40:31.679 --> 40:32.721
I'd have found a way.

40:32.721 --> 40:35.933
He has before. Many times.

40:36.892 --> 40:38.686
It's been a long evening.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.229
Go home, get some rest.

40:40.229 --> 40:42.481
Because when you go through
those doors again tomorrow,

40:42.481 --> 40:46.026
every second, minute,
and hour of every day forward

40:46.026 --> 40:48.487
is to be devoted to making
what happened tonight

40:48.487 --> 40:50.239
an impossibility.

41:11.552 --> 41:12.803
<i>I got your text.</i>

41:13.053 --> 41:15.806
You nailed down the Killer Mike
endorsement after all.

41:15.806 --> 41:17.433
High-risk move.

41:17.433 --> 41:20.352
- I did indeed. High reward.
- You're right.

41:20.352 --> 41:22.480
You are a different
breed than I'm used to.

41:22.480 --> 41:24.148
<i>I'm not above admitting that.</i>

41:24.148 --> 41:27.943
But that's a handicap I'm
trying to eliminate right now.

41:27.943 --> 41:29.445
I'm meeting with Wendy.

41:29.445 --> 41:32.281
<i>I need her insights into you,
Prince Capital,</i>

41:32.281 --> 41:34.283
<i>what makes
the whole thing work.</i>

41:34.283 --> 41:37.411
Better understanding on my part
equals better results.

41:37.411 --> 41:38.704
And she's not coming across.

41:38.704 --> 41:41.540
Says it's a nonstarter
without your okay.

41:41.540 --> 41:42.666
She's loyal.

41:42.666 --> 41:45.294
<i>Like Riley to Starks,
game seven.</i>

41:45.294 --> 41:46.754
Put her on.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.552
We've talked about trust.

41:53.552 --> 41:55.387
But there are always boundaries.

41:55.387 --> 41:58.807
Boundaries are a safeguard,
but they can be a limitation.

41:58.807 --> 42:01.810
Where I'm going,
I can't afford that.

42:01.810 --> 42:03.938
<i>It's fine,
you can talk to him.</i>

42:03.938 --> 42:06.232
About everything.

42:06.232 --> 42:08.859
All the parts
coming into alignment.

42:09.610 --> 42:11.445
Impressive.

42:11.445 --> 42:13.239
Today I saw how
expensive it can be

42:13.239 --> 42:15.908
when you don't put
your faith in your people.

42:19.662 --> 42:22.748
He sees something
special in you.

42:22.748 --> 42:26.043
I mean, besides the work
you're doing for him.

42:26.043 --> 42:27.461
He trusts you.

42:27.461 --> 42:30.214
Hard to get him to
the mountaintop without it.

42:36.095 --> 42:37.721
Yo, what's good?

42:37.721 --> 42:38.973
- Hi.
- Hey.

42:39.223 --> 42:40.683
So I'm wanting to start you off
with a couple things.

42:40.683 --> 42:42.434
We have chopped cheese
with black truffles,

42:42.434 --> 42:44.812
and we have curry goat patties
with a couple dipping sauces.

42:44.812 --> 42:46.772
Wendy, you know
I'm gonna cook for you, right?

42:46.772 --> 42:49.066
So, you won't be
needing these menus.

42:49.066 --> 42:51.485
- And I hope you're hungry.
- Thank you, Chef.

42:51.485 --> 42:52.820
Chef Kwame,
this is Bradford Luke.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.196
Hey, what's up, man?

42:54.196 --> 42:55.698
He's gonna be
bringing presidents

42:55.698 --> 42:57.366
to dine here one day soon.

42:57.366 --> 42:58.325
Dope.

42:58.325 --> 43:00.369
Well, I look forward to it.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.538
- Y'all enjoy.
- Thank you.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.251
So, what do you want to know?

43:07.251 --> 43:09.461
Tell me everything.

43:09.461 --> 43:10.713
About Mike Prince.

43:10.838 --> 43:15.467
He's driven by a need for
respect in a financial setting,

43:15.467 --> 43:17.845
through equal parts faith and--

43:17.845 --> 43:22.808
No. Not like you're
talking to a strategist.

43:22.808 --> 43:24.893
Like you're telling
the person closest to you

43:24.893 --> 43:27.646
everything you know
about the person

43:27.646 --> 43:29.231
you want to set them up with.

43:31.483 --> 43:34.111
The person you think
they should end up with.

43:35.279 --> 43:38.240
You want Mike Prince
the businessman?

43:38.240 --> 43:40.909
The human? The father?
The patient?

43:42.036 --> 43:43.912
I want it all.

43:45.623 --> 43:48.626
Then we're going
to need another bottle.

44:02.723 --> 44:04.475
Holy shit!

44:04.475 --> 44:05.809
Thank God!

44:05.809 --> 44:07.436
Thank you, Chuck.

44:07.436 --> 44:09.229
- Mm-hmm.
- This is incredible.

44:09.229 --> 44:12.274
I told you I'd take care of it.
I took care of it.

44:12.274 --> 44:13.692
Dave says
to change your password.

44:13.692 --> 44:16.362
It's too easy. They didn't
even have to use GrayKey.

44:16.362 --> 44:17.863
Are you still using
your birthday?

44:17.863 --> 44:20.783
It's-- I know. I'm making
a new one right now.

44:20.783 --> 44:21.659
Mm-hmm.

44:21.659 --> 44:23.452
And deleting those videos.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.663
Yeah. All of them?

44:25.663 --> 44:27.831
I mean, now
that we've got 'em back.

44:29.583 --> 44:32.169
Delete. Of course.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.713
Of course!

44:34.713 --> 44:36.757
You take the car.
I'll get another one.

44:36.757 --> 44:38.801
I'll meet you at home soon.

44:48.519 --> 44:50.020
I just want to say--

44:50.020 --> 44:51.772
No. You don't have to.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.023
No, actually, I do.

44:53.023 --> 44:54.400
I know this wasn't easy.

44:54.400 --> 44:58.195
I also know the price for it
has to be high.

44:58.195 --> 45:00.531
Mm. It is.

45:00.531 --> 45:02.199
Nosebleed altitude.

45:02.199 --> 45:05.619
With everything
we've been through,

45:06.453 --> 45:07.579
I-I've always known

45:07.579 --> 45:10.874
I could count on you
to do the right thing.

45:10.874 --> 45:12.501
Regardless of the sacrifice.

45:12.501 --> 45:16.964
Because you could always see
the bigger picture.

45:16.964 --> 45:18.757
But...

45:19.633 --> 45:21.719
this time...

45:22.553 --> 45:25.514
you could've, you should've...

45:25.514 --> 45:27.766
let me go down.

45:27.766 --> 45:29.893
Big picture, it was
the right thing to do.

45:31.145 --> 45:33.564
But you didn't.

45:33.564 --> 45:34.523
Why?

45:34.523 --> 45:37.234
Because you're my friend.

45:37.234 --> 45:40.112
And, uh...

45:40.112 --> 45:42.865
that's my big picture now.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.575
Chuck, I owe you one.

45:44.575 --> 45:50.330
I think the ledger
is probably even.

45:50.330 --> 45:52.666
You know what? Come on,
I know where there's some

45:52.666 --> 45:55.919
leftover sweet potato pie
with our names on it.

46:12.728 --> 46:14.104
Hm?

46:26.784 --> 46:29.411
I heard today
was a rough one here.

46:29.411 --> 46:31.955
Like Mavericks at low tide.

46:33.582 --> 46:36.752
When did you know you had
a way to hit Prince?

46:36.752 --> 46:39.463
After our conversation.

46:39.463 --> 46:42.424
First I had to get the original
firm to pull out of the IPO.

46:42.424 --> 46:44.051
Plant some seeds of doubt
about the deal.

46:44.051 --> 46:46.512
Turns out: "Are you really
gonna buy that shit?"

46:46.512 --> 46:48.597
goes a long way
in a volatile market.

46:48.597 --> 46:51.600
After they bailed on the IPO,
I leaked word to Spartan-Ives

46:51.600 --> 46:52.935
that candidate Prince would be

46:52.935 --> 46:54.645
very appreciative
if we got a look.

46:54.645 --> 46:56.688
I hadn't anticipated
Victor being able

46:56.688 --> 46:57.856
to get us the extra hour.

46:57.856 --> 46:58.816
He is very good at what he does.

46:58.816 --> 47:00.609
You should have let us know.

47:00.609 --> 47:01.777
Yep.

47:01.777 --> 47:04.905
You were completely exposed
if things went south.

47:04.905 --> 47:06.740
Maybe we could have helped
protect you,

47:06.740 --> 47:07.866
covered your tracks.

47:07.866 --> 47:10.536
I had to move alone.

47:10.536 --> 47:13.664
And I was confident
you'd see it. Eventually.

47:13.664 --> 47:15.582
But all this is only the setup.

47:15.582 --> 47:18.418
Getting to the payoff will be
much more challenging.

47:18.418 --> 47:20.212
The secrecy. The deception.

47:20.212 --> 47:21.839
I'm starting to get misty.

47:23.465 --> 47:26.468
- And now?
- I have sign-off.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.975
So, yes,
the beginnings of a plan.

47:35.853 --> 47:38.230
We might really have
some pieces here.

47:38.230 --> 47:40.774
We might indeed.

47:40.774 --> 47:42.359
So...

47:49.992 --> 47:54.079
Let's send
this motherfucker to Siberia.
