00:02.600 --> 00:03.795
<i>My name is Barry Allen,</i>

00:03.880 --> 00:05.439
<i>and I am
the fastest man alive.</i>

00:05.520 --> 00:07.193
<i>To the outside world,</i>

00:07.280 --> 00:09.192
<i>I'm an ordinary
forensic scientist.</i>

00:09.320 --> 00:10.595
<i>But secretly, with the help</i>

00:10.680 --> 00:12.319
<i>of my friends
at S.T.A.R. Labs,</i>

00:12.400 --> 00:13.400
<i>I fight crime and find</i>

00:13.480 --> 00:15.153
<i>other meta-humans like me.</i>

00:15.240 --> 00:17.176
<i>But when my daughter came back
from the future to help,</i>

00:17.200 --> 00:18.680
<i>she changed the present...</i>

00:19.960 --> 00:22.475
<i>and now our world
is more dangerous than ever.</i>

00:22.560 --> 00:24.836
<i>And I'm the only one
fast enough to save it.</i>

00:24.960 --> 00:27.429
<i>I am the Flash.</i>

00:28.360 --> 00:29.456
<i>Previously on</i> The Flash...

00:29.480 --> 00:30.550
<i>You threw yourself</i>

00:30.640 --> 00:32.472
off a building to save Dad?

00:32.560 --> 00:33.560
Yeah.

00:33.640 --> 00:35.216
<i>We all know the sound
of Cicada's breathing.</i>

00:35.240 --> 00:36.390
His lungs are injured.

00:36.480 --> 00:38.631
You can't keep doing this.
It's not healing.

00:38.720 --> 00:40.016
<i>Killer Frost has been
gone since the night</i>

00:40.040 --> 00:41.280
<i>that DeVoe took over your body.</i>

00:41.320 --> 00:42.436
Is she gone for good?

00:42.560 --> 00:43.616
I've tried everything
I can think of

00:43.640 --> 00:44.790
to get her to reappear.

00:44.880 --> 00:46.176
My father told me
to come find him.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.520
<i>My dad's been dead for years.</i>

00:47.600 --> 00:49.273
<i>He knew that there were
two of you.</i>

00:49.400 --> 00:51.631
He knew the truth
about Killer Frost.

00:51.720 --> 00:52.995
<i>We've got eyes and ears!</i>

00:53.080 --> 00:54.639
I knew you could do it.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.632
There's only one sure place
somebody could hide.

00:56.720 --> 00:58.313
A Tannhauser black ops site.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.717
Vanilla latte
and a Medium Zoom for Raelene.

01:05.800 --> 01:07.439
Thank you.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.155
Should've left me alone.

02:12.760 --> 02:17.630
And you
never should have existed.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.795
We are back in business.

02:31.920 --> 02:32.990
And by business, he means

02:33.080 --> 02:34.958
the better-than-Sally
the satellite business.

02:35.040 --> 02:36.394
And what does that mean?

02:36.480 --> 02:38.358
That means we're getting
closer to identifying

02:38.440 --> 02:40.432
the ever-elusive Cicada.

02:40.520 --> 02:42.239
It's Cicada, Sherloque.

02:42.320 --> 02:44.960
Once I hacked
DeVoe's satellites,

02:45.040 --> 02:48.795
all I had to do was just use an
impact extrapolation algorithm

02:48.880 --> 02:51.076
to predict where the shrapnel
would've fallen

02:51.160 --> 02:53.311
after Barry and Nora pulled
a Johnny Cage

02:53.440 --> 02:54.440
on Sally the satellite.

02:54.520 --> 02:55.670
May God rest her soul.

02:55.760 --> 02:57.717
So now we got 46 locations

02:57.800 --> 02:59.871
where 46 pieces
of shrapnel landed.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.350
And once of these
locations is where Cicada

03:02.440 --> 03:03.590
will have been injured.

03:03.680 --> 03:05.273
Except we don't know
which one.

03:05.360 --> 03:07.079
Or maybe we do.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.391
You see, after my hands got
sliced by Cicada's dagger,

03:09.480 --> 03:11.199
Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman, here

03:11.280 --> 03:13.158
measured the dark matter
in my system.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.357
And its levels
of concentration were higher

03:15.440 --> 03:16.715
than any I'd ever seen before.

03:16.840 --> 03:19.400
Insanely high, and the
only part of the satellite

03:19.480 --> 03:21.836
that would have dark matter
levels that high...

03:21.920 --> 03:23.274
<i>Is the core,</i>

03:23.360 --> 03:25.272
which is where
Cicada's dagger came from.

03:25.360 --> 03:27.113
So we find the location
of the core

03:27.200 --> 03:28.456
and we'll know where
Cicada was that night.

03:28.480 --> 03:29.960
You know, FEMA set up sites

03:30.040 --> 03:31.256
to help people after
the Enlightenment.

03:31.280 --> 03:32.280
If Cicada was injured,

03:32.360 --> 03:34.176
maybe he received medical
treatment at one of them.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.200
That's a great idea.

03:35.280 --> 03:37.920
I mean, we could check with
FEMA to see if any fathers

03:38.000 --> 03:40.720
matching Cicada's description
reported any injuries

03:40.800 --> 03:42.678
- near the crash site.
- So, we split up.

03:42.760 --> 03:44.456
Okay, great. I'm good
at tracking things down.

03:44.480 --> 03:46.312
So I will try and find
the satellite core.

03:46.400 --> 03:48.120
I will come with you and
everybody else look

03:48.160 --> 03:49.160
<i>for the names.</i>

03:49.240 --> 03:51.016
Um, do you mind if I actually
come with you too?

03:51.040 --> 03:53.236
It's just that I saw you
jump off a building last week

03:53.320 --> 03:54.470
and that was awesome.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.153
<i>So I thought maybe
I'd come with you</i>

03:56.240 --> 03:58.038
while you did
some detective work.

03:58.120 --> 03:59.656
Oh, I think that two people
is going to be more than enough

03:59.680 --> 04:01.336
- for what we need...
- What he's trying to say

04:01.360 --> 04:03.397
is that we would love
to have you come with us.

04:03.480 --> 04:05.312
Okay.

04:07.920 --> 04:09.576
<i>All right, well,
why don't I talk to FEMA</i>

04:09.600 --> 04:10.954
and see if I can get
some names.

04:11.040 --> 04:12.315
Hey, I know
Joe's been itching

04:12.400 --> 04:13.736
to get out of the house,
and it might help

04:13.760 --> 04:15.160
to have an actual badge.

04:15.240 --> 04:17.038
Nobody does case snacks
like Joe West.

04:17.120 --> 04:18.920
- I'll swing by on the way.
- All right, cool.

04:21.480 --> 04:26.077
So, Snow Patrol,
what's going on?

04:26.200 --> 04:27.714
You tell me.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.951
I'm guessing
it's not a coincidence

04:30.080 --> 04:32.072
that we're left here
with nothing to do

04:32.160 --> 04:33.435
for the next few hours.

04:33.520 --> 04:35.671
I know we were supposed
to wait until you were ready

04:35.760 --> 04:37.035
to locate your dad.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.760
<i>But I had the satellites
track down</i>

04:39.880 --> 04:42.270
all the decommissioned
Tannhauser black ops sites

04:42.360 --> 04:43.720
that your dad
could possibly be in.

04:43.760 --> 04:44.760
Okay.

04:44.840 --> 04:49.596
And... and then I hacked into
their security systems.

04:49.680 --> 04:51.637
He was the last person
to enter one of them.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.120
A week after he died.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.840
And he never left.

04:58.920 --> 05:00.479
Where is he?

05:04.400 --> 05:06.232
It's open. Come in.

05:07.920 --> 05:10.435
Hey! Cecile.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.718
- Hey.
- Is... is Joe here?

05:12.800 --> 05:14.792
Uh, no.
He's out with Jenna.

05:14.880 --> 05:16.473
Oh, dang.
Okay. Bummer.

05:16.560 --> 05:19.200
All right, I'll go get some
falafel and come back in a bit.

05:19.280 --> 05:20.555
Wait, no. Please don't...

05:20.640 --> 05:23.553
Leave me here.
Um, what did you need?

05:23.640 --> 05:25.393
Maybe I can help you.

05:25.480 --> 05:28.393
Oh, I need somebody
to flash a badge

05:28.480 --> 05:30.756
and generally
look intimidating, so.

05:30.840 --> 05:34.436
You don't think
that I can be intimidating.

05:34.560 --> 05:36.119
Oh, my God, you don't,
do you?

05:38.200 --> 05:39.839
Ralph, I am the district
attorney.

05:39.920 --> 05:41.536
You know I psychically
teleported the Flash

05:41.560 --> 05:43.233
inside the Thinker's mind

05:43.360 --> 05:45.556
whilst giving birth
to my daughter,

05:45.640 --> 05:47.279
sans epidural... it hurt!

05:47.360 --> 05:51.559
I literally saved the world
between contractions,

05:51.640 --> 05:54.109
and you don't think
that I am intimidating?

05:54.200 --> 05:56.032
I'm really intimidated
right now, actually.

05:56.120 --> 05:57.634
You are very intimidating.

05:57.720 --> 05:59.677
Okay, what are we doing?

05:59.760 --> 06:03.515
Uh, we are getting a list
of FEMA recipients treated

06:03.600 --> 06:05.796
after the Enlightenment
to hopefully find

06:05.880 --> 06:06.880
Cicada's real name.

06:06.960 --> 06:09.270
FEMA, come on.
I've worked with them a ton.

06:09.360 --> 06:10.714
I know that org inside and out.

06:10.800 --> 06:13.156
Just, uh... oh, give me five.
I gotta go pump first.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.833
What are we pumping?

06:14.920 --> 06:17.355
Oh.

06:17.480 --> 06:20.040
<i>Coordinates are set
for the North Pole.</i>

06:22.560 --> 06:25.519
Thank you guys
for coming with me.

06:25.600 --> 06:26.954
Ready when you are.

06:27.040 --> 06:28.633
Okay.

06:30.400 --> 06:33.279
Oh!
Here we go.

06:36.720 --> 06:38.632
Can't see anything!

06:38.720 --> 06:41.110
My face just went
full Weeknd!

06:41.200 --> 06:42.475
Wait,
I think I see something.

06:42.560 --> 06:43.880
Over here!

06:43.960 --> 06:45.633
What?

06:47.240 --> 06:48.435
I think it's a building.

06:50.600 --> 06:52.876
Is there a door?

06:52.960 --> 06:55.316
We don't need one.

07:01.080 --> 07:04.039
Hello?
Anybody here?

07:04.120 --> 07:06.157
There.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.034
<i>Hey.</i>

07:23.160 --> 07:25.152
You okay?

07:25.240 --> 07:26.720
When my father entered
this facility

07:26.840 --> 07:28.320
nearly 20 years ago,

07:28.400 --> 07:31.040
he had severe ALS.

07:31.120 --> 07:35.512
Maybe the reason he never left
is 'cause he couldn't.

07:35.640 --> 07:37.836
Look,
whatever we find in here,

07:37.920 --> 07:39.274
we'll be right here
with you.

07:49.920 --> 07:51.513
Ugh.

07:51.600 --> 07:54.957
It smells like science
in here.

07:55.040 --> 07:58.078
What kind of research does
your mom's lab do, exactly?

07:58.160 --> 08:01.551
I honestly
don't even know anymore.

08:01.640 --> 08:02.676
<i>Caity?</i>

08:06.800 --> 08:10.032
Dad? Is that you?

08:10.120 --> 08:12.589
Is this really happening?

08:12.720 --> 08:14.598
You're alive.

08:14.720 --> 08:15.995
Are you... you're real?

08:16.080 --> 08:18.754
Yeah, Dad, it's me.
I'm real. I'm real.

08:21.720 --> 08:23.279
You found me.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.352
You got my message.

08:35.440 --> 08:38.399
I did in the periodic table
we made together.

08:38.480 --> 08:42.360
It took me 20 years to find it,
but it led me to you.

08:42.440 --> 08:44.318
I knew you would come.

08:44.400 --> 08:45.800
Thank you.

08:45.920 --> 08:47.752
I thank all of you.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.111
Dad, these are my friends.
This is...

08:50.200 --> 08:53.671
Uh, Barry Allen
and Cisco Ramon. I know.

08:53.800 --> 08:56.031
Um, sorry.
How do you know us?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.634
Well, when I first came here,

08:57.720 --> 08:59.393
I stayed in contact
with scientists.

08:59.480 --> 09:03.360
Louise Lincoln, Victor Fries,
and Harrison Wells.

09:03.440 --> 09:07.036
Dr. Wells was able to get me
full access to, uh,

09:07.120 --> 09:09.555
S.T.A.R. Labs video uplink.

09:09.640 --> 09:12.633
Wait a minute. You've... you've
had video link to S.T.A.R. Labs

09:12.720 --> 09:13.836
this entire time?

09:13.920 --> 09:16.310
Oh, no. God no. I mean, it
hasn't worked until recently.

09:16.400 --> 09:18.153
And unfortunately,
since it rebooted,

09:18.240 --> 09:21.199
its capabilities is only
as a one-way video,

09:21.280 --> 09:24.512
so I could see you
but I couldn't reach you.

09:24.600 --> 09:27.513
Well, it looks like you had
plenty of toys around here

09:27.600 --> 09:28.670
to keep you company.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.592
This neat little incubator.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.000
What's it for?

09:32.080 --> 09:35.073
Well, that was here
when I got here.

09:35.160 --> 09:37.550
Never had any use
for that thing.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.956
I don't understand.
Why are you here?

09:40.040 --> 09:42.111
I mean, how are you
still even alive?

09:42.200 --> 09:46.114
ALS is a horrible disease,
and I grew desperate,

09:46.200 --> 09:50.592
and I began experimenting with
therapies using cryogenics.

09:50.680 --> 09:52.592
Something went wrong?

09:52.680 --> 09:53.680
Yes.

09:53.760 --> 09:56.992
The, uh, experiments became
more and more dangerous.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.719
and I quarantined myself

09:58.800 --> 10:01.952
for the sake
of everyone's safety.

10:02.040 --> 10:07.354
I did manage to freeze the
progression of that disease.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.751
Not before the site
was entirely closed down,

10:10.880 --> 10:12.837
<i>and I have been here
ever since.</i>

10:12.920 --> 10:14.856
They shut down this site
while you were still in it

10:14.880 --> 10:16.599
<i>and locked you in.</i>

10:16.680 --> 10:18.990
It was my mother,
wasn't it?

10:19.080 --> 10:21.549
She's the only one with
an authority to shut down

10:21.680 --> 10:23.114
a Tannhauser site.

10:23.200 --> 10:24.336
Listen, your mother thought
it would be easier

10:24.360 --> 10:25.589
for you not to see me.

10:25.680 --> 10:28.957
But I always had the faith
that I could cure this thing.

10:29.040 --> 10:31.874
That's why I sent you the note.

10:31.960 --> 10:34.634
So how... how did you survive
here this whole time?

10:34.720 --> 10:37.838
Water.
Rations.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.197
Spending months at a time
in that cryogenic chamber.

10:41.280 --> 10:43.920
Well, you don't ever
have to do that again,

10:44.000 --> 10:46.799
because we can get you
out of here.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.712
We're gonna give you
your life back.

10:54.240 --> 10:57.836
Shouldn't this place
be packed to the rafters?

10:57.920 --> 11:01.470
I mean, we had a citywide
disaster not long ago.

11:01.560 --> 11:03.517
Don't worry. I got this.

11:03.640 --> 11:05.916
It's time to put
the war face on.

11:07.760 --> 11:10.195
Hey, buddy, pull them out.

11:10.280 --> 11:13.034
Lose the music.
Hi, I'm DA Cecile Horton.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.510
This is my associate,
Ralph Dibny.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.159
DA?
Mm.

11:17.240 --> 11:18.594
How can I help you?

11:18.680 --> 11:20.080
You the field director here?

11:20.160 --> 11:22.994
Assistant. You got a claim or
something I can help you with?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.879
We're trying to ID a suspect
in a criminal investigation

11:25.960 --> 11:27.296
and we're going to need
to take a look at the names of

11:27.320 --> 11:30.040
all the people you've assisted
in the last six months.

11:30.120 --> 11:32.794
I can't give you
anyone's names.

11:32.920 --> 11:34.798
You'll need to get
a warrant for that.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.957
Listen up, mister!

11:37.040 --> 11:38.599
Vagger Bance!

11:38.680 --> 11:39.909
It's Vance Brandon.

11:41.400 --> 11:43.915
You listen to me
when I tell you

11:44.000 --> 11:46.515
that this is my town, baby.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.155
Oh, yeah,
and I can make some real

11:49.240 --> 11:50.993
bad stuff happen for you.

11:51.080 --> 11:52.753
Like, really, really <i>no bueno.</i>

11:52.840 --> 11:55.719
Yeah, well,
this is my country,

11:55.800 --> 11:57.792
which is a lot bigger
than your town.

11:57.880 --> 12:00.679
- That's true.
- So, until you get a warrant,

12:00.760 --> 12:02.479
you're not getting anything.

12:02.560 --> 12:05.314
But wait, did you... Bagger?
Bagger Va... did you...

12:05.400 --> 12:06.834
But this my war face.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.071
I put my war face on.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.719
That was my war face, Ralph.

12:10.800 --> 12:12.553
It's okay, I... I think
you're just...

12:12.640 --> 12:14.393
you're... you're a little rusty,
that's all.

12:14.480 --> 12:16.199
Oh, no.
That was way more

12:16.280 --> 12:19.114
than a little rust, Ralph.

12:19.200 --> 12:21.271
I've lost my mojo.

12:25.880 --> 12:28.918
Oh, that was a...
new mode of travel.

12:29.000 --> 12:31.117
That is what we call
an interdimensional

12:31.200 --> 12:32.554
space-time breach.

12:32.640 --> 12:33.976
It takes a little while
to get used to it.

12:34.000 --> 12:38.836
So, this is
S.T.A.R. Labs, IRL.

12:38.920 --> 12:41.719
Look at that view.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.154
I want to run some tests.

12:43.280 --> 12:45.920
Make sure everything
is all right with you.

12:46.000 --> 12:49.391
This city is so beautiful.

12:51.440 --> 12:53.796
The sunsets here.

12:53.880 --> 12:56.031
I used to think about them
all the time.

12:56.120 --> 12:57.793
Hey, maybe you guys
should just

12:57.920 --> 12:59.149
go for a walk or something.

12:59.240 --> 13:01.675
Try and reconnect first.

13:01.800 --> 13:03.393
Yeah.

13:03.480 --> 13:06.120
Um, why don't we go
for a walk?

13:06.200 --> 13:07.759
Get some fresh air.

13:07.840 --> 13:09.354
I can run my tests later.

13:09.440 --> 13:10.954
I love that plan.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.796
This way.

13:18.160 --> 13:19.833
What's up with you?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.559
Dude, this story
is full of holes.

13:21.640 --> 13:22.800
I'm just trying to fill them.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.593
Nora's story
had holes in them,

13:24.680 --> 13:27.115
and she was only lying to me
'cause she wanted to meet me.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.800
I've appreciated every second
that we've had together so far.

13:29.880 --> 13:33.032
Caitlin just got her dad back.

13:33.120 --> 13:34.156
Let's be happy for her.

13:34.240 --> 13:36.835
Okay, I'm happy.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.351
So what are we doing first?

13:48.440 --> 13:51.433
Uh, well,
you're a speedster.

13:51.520 --> 13:55.196
So I was thinking
you could run around the site.

13:55.280 --> 13:57.033
See if you can find the core.

13:57.120 --> 13:59.000
I thought, since it's
our first time teaming up,

13:59.040 --> 14:01.919
maybe I could go with you and
we can interview the people

14:02.000 --> 14:03.896
who were here the night
of the Enlightenment together.

14:03.920 --> 14:06.754
Oh, um, uh...

14:06.840 --> 14:07.990
- Or no.
- No, no, no.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.719
Yeah, it's just...

14:09.800 --> 14:12.793
normally, I interview people
by myself.

14:12.880 --> 14:15.839
Oh, oh, my God.
No, no. It's fine.

14:15.920 --> 14:18.056
It's... I wouldn't ask you
to come speed around the city

14:18.080 --> 14:19.434
<i>with me or anything like that.</i>

14:19.520 --> 14:20.920
<i>It's fine.
Okay, well, I'll...</i>

14:21.000 --> 14:23.595
No, no, no. You come with me...
I'll come with you, okay.

14:23.680 --> 14:24.955
And we'll interview
the foreman.

14:25.040 --> 14:26.296
All right, let's not.
How about that?

14:26.320 --> 14:28.516
Look, we have 45 more sites
to search.

14:28.600 --> 14:31.274
Clearly we don't have the time
and clearly we must split up.

14:31.360 --> 14:34.194
So you go search for the core.
You go talk to the foreman.

14:34.280 --> 14:35.794
I will look for clues.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.950
And this is how
investigations collapse.

14:42.040 --> 14:43.679
Hey, babe.

14:43.760 --> 14:46.480
No, the mother-daughter team-up
is kinda off to a rocky start.

14:46.560 --> 14:47.776
But I don't know,
I think we'll get there.

14:47.800 --> 14:48.870
So?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.792
- The core's not here.
- Well...

14:50.880 --> 14:52.376
why don't you go search
the other sites?

14:52.400 --> 14:53.959
We'll finish up here.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.996
But, no, you don't want
to do that, do you, no?

14:58.080 --> 15:01.835
Because, um, you're not here
to investigate, are you?

15:01.960 --> 15:03.936
No, you're here to spend time
with your mother, right?

15:03.960 --> 15:05.816
Well, I just thought maybe
we would find something

15:05.840 --> 15:07.752
in common if we worked on
a case together.

15:07.840 --> 15:11.197
But she's really good at prying
information out of people.

15:11.280 --> 15:13.351
Believe me, and...

15:13.440 --> 15:16.672
I'm fast on my feet.

15:16.760 --> 15:18.194
I'm gonna go back
to S.T.A.R. labs.

15:18.280 --> 15:19.953
Hold on, wait.

15:20.040 --> 15:22.999
I have another plan
to try and find this core.

15:23.080 --> 15:25.356
It involves you
and your mother.

15:30.640 --> 15:33.360
So, uh, cherry soda.
Popcorn.

15:33.440 --> 15:36.831
I haven't had a cup of Jitters
coffee in quite a while.

15:36.920 --> 15:40.357
But the thing that
I miss the most was...

15:40.440 --> 15:42.557
Peanut butter
and jelly waffles.

15:42.640 --> 15:45.360
Yeah, Mom used to hate it
when you made those.

15:45.440 --> 15:47.671
Yeah, well,
your mom always wanted

15:47.800 --> 15:50.838
the nicer things in life,
I guess,

15:50.920 --> 15:53.389
and I was happy with simple.

15:53.480 --> 15:56.837
It's a wonder you two
ever got together.

15:56.920 --> 15:59.151
- How is she?
<i>- The same.</i>

15:59.240 --> 16:00.754
I don't really see her
that often,

16:00.840 --> 16:02.638
and when I do,
she's cold as ice.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.632
<i>And now,
after what she did to you...</i>

16:04.720 --> 16:06.439
Oh, well, look,

16:06.520 --> 16:10.116
she may be a little bit chilly,
but she does love you, Caity.

16:10.200 --> 16:11.520
It's been really hard
without you.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.439
I mean, just me and her.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.000
It was tough.

16:16.120 --> 16:18.430
- Yeah.
- I've been through a lot.

16:18.520 --> 16:21.319
A lot of that
has to do with me.

16:21.400 --> 16:22.595
- No.
- No, no, listen,

16:22.680 --> 16:24.592
and... and I wasn't there
for you.

16:24.680 --> 16:26.717
All these years...
they went by and I...

16:26.800 --> 16:28.473
I want to make it up
to you, Caity.

16:28.560 --> 16:31.075
I mean, I really should've
been there for you, right?

16:31.160 --> 16:33.072
I mean... and I wish that
I could just...

16:33.160 --> 16:35.072
Dad? Oh, my God.

16:35.160 --> 16:37.391
Dad. Here, sit.

16:37.480 --> 16:38.960
Oh, my God. Dad?

16:39.040 --> 16:41.680
Dad, Dad.

16:55.560 --> 16:56.676
Caity?

16:56.760 --> 16:58.797
Dad? I'm right here.

17:01.680 --> 17:04.991
You saw my disease?

17:05.079 --> 17:10.108
Yeah, uh... the dermis
is crystallizing.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.680
And it's spreading.

17:11.800 --> 17:14.315
I ran some tests
while you were unconscious.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.756
You have
a cryogenic malignancy

17:16.839 --> 17:18.797
<i>and a somatic mutation.</i>

17:18.880 --> 17:20.678
It's not contagious but...

17:20.760 --> 17:22.240
It's rewriting
my genetic code.

17:22.319 --> 17:24.789
And if it continues,
you could...

17:24.880 --> 17:25.950
Die.

17:28.000 --> 17:31.118
Well, I cured my ALS,

17:31.200 --> 17:33.476
but I created something
even more deadly.

17:34.760 --> 17:38.071
Every time my emotions spike,
my malignancy spreads.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.715
<i>Like when you're angry
or scared?</i>

17:40.800 --> 17:42.837
<i>I wish I had just left
well enough alone.</i>

17:42.920 --> 17:45.151
For both of us.

17:45.240 --> 17:49.996
Wait, did I have
the genetic marker for ALS too

17:50.080 --> 17:52.356
and you tried to cure me?

17:52.440 --> 17:55.239
So my powers came from you?

17:55.320 --> 17:57.118
Killer Frost is my cure?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.395
Killer Frost?

17:58.480 --> 18:00.312
<i>You may know her
by a different name.</i>

18:00.400 --> 18:01.720
Khione.

18:01.800 --> 18:03.314
Dad, what did you do to me?

18:03.400 --> 18:05.869
I wasn't gonna let
the ALS manifest in you

18:05.960 --> 18:06.960
<i>like it did in me.</i>

18:07.040 --> 18:11.034
So you used experimental
cryogenic gene therapy

18:11.120 --> 18:12.349
on your own daughter?

18:12.440 --> 18:14.636
I had already done it
on myself.

18:14.720 --> 18:18.600
Caity, I made alterations
to the treatment.

18:18.680 --> 18:20.478
I tried to make it
safer, Caity,

18:20.560 --> 18:23.200
and you started to exhibit
dual personality

18:23.280 --> 18:25.476
soon after I treated you.

18:26.360 --> 18:31.071
So is, um, Khione
or Killer Frost...

18:31.160 --> 18:32.514
is she still around?

18:32.600 --> 18:35.479
Um, she... she's been gone
for a little while,

18:35.560 --> 18:37.119
but she's still a part of me.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.474
So where's
your dual personality?

18:41.560 --> 18:43.711
You and Caitlin carry
the same markers,

18:43.800 --> 18:45.917
you took the same cure.

18:46.000 --> 18:47.957
Where your Khione?

18:48.040 --> 18:50.191
I never had one.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.990
That's probably why...

18:55.080 --> 18:57.151
I'm dying and you're not.

18:57.280 --> 19:00.990
Okay, what if we use
my cells to create a serum

19:01.080 --> 19:03.037
to stabilize your body?

19:03.160 --> 19:04.896
Um, we have to stop your atoms
from oscillating.

19:04.920 --> 19:07.674
So get your body to
a temperature of absolute zero.

19:07.760 --> 19:09.114
Caitlin,
that could kill him.

19:09.200 --> 19:11.032
My cells can theoretically

19:11.120 --> 19:13.316
withstand subzero
temperatures

19:13.400 --> 19:15.551
because of
my cryogenic gene therapy.

19:15.640 --> 19:20.271
But the problem is getting
to absolute zero.

19:20.360 --> 19:22.716
We could use
a laser cooling array.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.314
The DOD just constructed one

19:24.400 --> 19:25.600
at their site outside of town.

19:25.680 --> 19:26.936
- I could check it out.
- Okay, great.

19:26.960 --> 19:28.189
I'll get started
on the serum.

19:28.280 --> 19:30.840
No, no, wait.
Hold on.

19:30.920 --> 19:32.798
We... we can't just hack into

19:32.880 --> 19:35.349
the DOD's $5 billion
security system.

19:38.440 --> 19:40.830
<i>Cisco.</i>

19:40.920 --> 19:44.391
I just got my dad back.
I can't let him die.

19:47.000 --> 19:48.593
I'll see what I can do.

19:52.680 --> 19:55.320
It's the fifth person
to be sliced up this week.

19:55.400 --> 19:58.837
Take him to OR Three.

20:15.040 --> 20:17.839
Oh, my God.
What happened to you?

20:17.920 --> 20:20.389
I'm fine.
I need to stitch that up.

20:20.480 --> 20:22.756
You've got abrasions,
possible internal injuries.

20:22.840 --> 20:24.035
You keep going out there,

20:24.120 --> 20:25.456
you're gonna be back here
in a body bag.

20:25.480 --> 20:29.474
You can't be a part of this.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.816
Do you know how many
patients I've seen

20:30.840 --> 20:32.440
come in this hospital
the past four years

20:32.480 --> 20:34.358
because of those metas
out there?

20:34.440 --> 20:35.536
I just treated a man
who was attacked by

20:35.560 --> 20:37.153
a human razor blade,
and you wanna say

20:37.240 --> 20:38.390
I'm not a part of this?

20:38.480 --> 20:39.630
Oh, I got that razor meta.

20:39.720 --> 20:41.996
Just like I'll get
the rest of them.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.276
I know why you're doing this.

20:44.360 --> 20:46.113
And I know that little girl
laying in a coma

20:46.200 --> 20:48.635
is not my family, but you
are not the only one

20:48.720 --> 20:50.536
whose heart breaks every day
she doesn't wake up.

20:50.560 --> 20:56.033
Grace is the one
that needs help. Not me.

20:56.120 --> 20:58.999
Now, are you gonna get out
of my way, Doc?

20:59.080 --> 21:02.118
Or are you gonna call security?

21:11.480 --> 21:13.836
<i>What the heck happened
back there?</i>

21:13.920 --> 21:15.354
I froze up.

21:17.680 --> 21:18.750
Look.

21:18.880 --> 21:20.314
When I got canned from CCPD,

21:20.400 --> 21:25.156
I fell in with some legally
questionable individuals.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.755
These are some scary,
scary people,

21:27.840 --> 21:30.309
but they all had
one thing in common.

21:30.400 --> 21:34.792
They were all terrified
of Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton.

21:34.880 --> 21:36.519
And I don't believe
for one second that

21:36.600 --> 21:39.513
that woman
has gone anywhere.

21:41.000 --> 21:42.639
Don't ever call me
that again.

21:42.720 --> 21:45.599
I'm sorry. Geez. I thought
I... I thought we were bonding

21:45.680 --> 21:48.240
and having a moment, but
I think I crossed the line.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.595
I didn't really mean to...

21:49.680 --> 21:52.878
I'm kidding. It's a joke.
I was joking.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.474
My gosh, I really got you.

21:54.560 --> 21:57.120
You didn't have to get
so nervous about it.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.910
Nervous.
Like the FEMA guy did.

22:01.000 --> 22:04.277
Ralph, I don't think
I froze up back there.

22:04.360 --> 22:07.319
Right. Right, you're...
you're an empath now.

22:07.400 --> 22:09.869
Your powers let you
experience his fear.

22:09.960 --> 22:11.838
You're... you're the Deanna Troi
of Team Flash.

22:11.920 --> 22:14.000
I have no idea who that is,
but if he got that scared

22:14.080 --> 22:15.878
when we asked him
about the victims list...

22:15.960 --> 22:17.296
It's because
he's hiding something.

22:17.320 --> 22:18.754
Yes.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.559
Whoa, whoa. What's, uh,

22:20.640 --> 22:22.597
what's happening with
your nose right now?

22:22.680 --> 22:24.956
Oh, when I smell a mystery,
that's my thing. I do that.

22:25.040 --> 22:26.520
- That's nasty.
- It is? You don't...

22:26.600 --> 22:28.637
- Please stop.
- You don't like it?

22:28.720 --> 22:32.316

22:42.640 --> 22:46.190
He has been singing that same
song for the last two hours.

22:46.280 --> 22:47.680
I know, I know.

22:47.800 --> 22:49.519
Are you seriously
making tea right now?

22:49.600 --> 22:51.956
<i>Le thé. Oui.</i>
Right, chamomile.

22:52.040 --> 22:54.760
You know, to stimulate
the brain, but also, frankly,

22:54.840 --> 22:56.274
the digestive system.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.636
Right, because since
I've arrived here,

22:58.720 --> 23:00.518
I've been backed up
like a traffic jam.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.115
That is so disgusting.
Beyond disgusting.

23:03.200 --> 23:04.759
How are we supposed
to investigate

23:04.840 --> 23:06.638
when you're making tea,
Sherloque?

23:06.720 --> 23:08.712
Well, you seem very annoyed,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

23:08.800 --> 23:11.031
- No shrap, Sherlock.
- Sherloque.

23:11.120 --> 23:14.033
Sorry for the language, Mom.

23:14.160 --> 23:15.753
It's okay.

23:15.840 --> 23:17.752
Hey, look.

23:17.840 --> 23:20.674
There was a carnival the night
the satellite crashed.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.776
If my dad is right about Cicada
being a father, then maybe...

23:22.800 --> 23:24.080
He might've brought
his kid here.

23:24.120 --> 23:25.270
Exactly.

23:25.360 --> 23:26.416
But, I mean,
I ran all over this place.

23:26.440 --> 23:27.556
There's no core in sight.

23:27.640 --> 23:30.951
<i>♪♪ C'est l'aviron qui nous
mène, qui nous mène ♪♪</i>

23:32.560 --> 23:33.960
What if...

23:34.040 --> 23:35.952
The core fell into
the water.

23:36.040 --> 23:37.759
How you will retrieve it?

23:37.840 --> 23:39.656
Nora, why don't you create
a vortex like your dad did

23:39.680 --> 23:40.720
when he fought King Shark?

23:40.760 --> 23:43.434
Oh, no, or what if we do
what you did with the Hotness?

23:43.520 --> 23:44.636
You know about that?

23:44.720 --> 23:46.996
Yeah, of course. I made Papa
Joe tell me everything about

23:47.080 --> 23:48.753
when my mom was a speedster.

23:48.840 --> 23:50.638
So how do we do it?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.518
Um...

23:52.600 --> 23:56.640
Well, you just, um... you run
back and forth in a...

23:56.720 --> 23:57.995
in a really tight formation.

23:58.120 --> 24:00.157
And you want to pull the water
up with your heels.

24:00.240 --> 24:02.296
Okay, right, which would drive
the water away from the shore.

24:02.320 --> 24:03.320
Exactly.

24:03.400 --> 24:05.312
- Schway.
- Yeah.

24:05.400 --> 24:06.914
Do you think I can do it?

24:07.000 --> 24:09.037
Yeah, Nora, you got this.

24:09.120 --> 24:10.156
Okay.

24:15.760 --> 24:17.080
<i>Four satellites?</i>

24:17.160 --> 24:18.958
Give them to Cisco.
He's got 'em.

24:19.040 --> 24:23.319
DOD sites? There you go.
All in a day's work for him.

24:23.440 --> 24:25.909
You all think I can
just hack anything, huh?

24:35.200 --> 24:37.032
Yeah.

24:37.160 --> 24:38.913
I can hack anything.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.990
There you are.

24:48.080 --> 24:50.231
Oh!

25:22.080 --> 25:23.753
I found a path
into the DOD base.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.776
As long as Cisco can shut down
the interior alarms,

25:25.800 --> 25:27.075
it'll work.

25:27.160 --> 25:28.456
Awesome. I just need
to balance this serum

25:28.480 --> 25:29.709
and we should be good to go.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.314
Thank you for this, Caity.

25:31.400 --> 25:34.154
I mean, what you're doing
is beyond the call.

25:34.240 --> 25:35.356
Of course, you're my dad.

25:35.440 --> 25:37.318
I'd do anything for you.

25:37.400 --> 25:39.232
He's not your dad.

25:41.880 --> 25:43.200
Look familiar?

25:46.320 --> 25:48.630
Cisco.
What are you talking about?

25:48.720 --> 25:51.758
This is my father.

25:51.840 --> 25:54.594
I went back to the Tannhauser
black ops site,

25:54.680 --> 25:56.000
and I picked up a vibe.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.878
I saw him working in the lab...

25:57.960 --> 26:00.191
Cisco, your vibes have been
a little problematic...

26:00.280 --> 26:03.193
I know what I saw. I saw him
standing over the incubator,

26:03.280 --> 26:04.919
the one he claimed
he had no use for,

26:05.040 --> 26:06.679
and he was working on this.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.150
Skin grafts? What does this
have to do with anything?

26:09.240 --> 26:11.994
This is gonna sound
whacked-out,

26:12.080 --> 26:15.357
but what if, when your dad
tried to cure his ALS,

26:15.440 --> 26:17.796
it didn't just give him
crystallized skin?

26:17.880 --> 26:21.237
What if it really did create
that dual personality?

26:21.320 --> 26:24.392
- This Killer Frost?
- That's who you think this is?

26:24.480 --> 26:27.120
Thomas' alter ego wearing
a copy of his face

26:27.200 --> 26:28.714
made out of these skin grafts?

26:28.800 --> 26:31.395
Yes, I know.
I know it-it sounds...

26:31.480 --> 26:33.995
It sounds absurd,
but I can see where

26:34.080 --> 26:36.879
Mr. Ramon is getting
his hypothesis.

26:36.960 --> 26:42.479
My, uh, cryo-malignancy spread
further than I admitted,

26:42.560 --> 26:47.555
and it's afflicted my face,
my hands, my arms, my chest.

26:47.640 --> 26:49.836
And I created those
skin grafts from stem cells

26:49.960 --> 26:51.280
that I found in the lab

26:51.360 --> 26:53.352
in order to cover
any further outbreaks.

26:53.440 --> 26:54.715
You're lying to us.

26:54.840 --> 26:56.336
- Cisco...
- Caitlyn, you have to see...

26:56.360 --> 26:58.158
No, you need
to leave us alone.

26:58.240 --> 27:00.277
- Please...
- Now!

27:07.400 --> 27:09.960
I got it.

27:10.040 --> 27:12.157
Dude. Hey dude,
we need to talk.

27:12.240 --> 27:15.074
Why? I thought that dramatic
confrontation worked perfectly.

27:15.160 --> 27:17.152
- We all want to help Caitlin.
- Oh, do you?

27:17.280 --> 27:19.216
Yeah, I want Caitlin to have
a chance to be with her father.

27:19.240 --> 27:21.000
Just like Nora got
the chance to be with you?

27:21.040 --> 27:22.633
See, this is your problem.

27:22.720 --> 27:24.677
You think that this is just
another perfect

27:24.760 --> 27:26.752
father-daughter pairing,
reunited.

27:26.840 --> 27:28.559
I'm not blinded
by my feelings.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.136
Well, they're not helping
you see any clearer.

27:30.160 --> 27:32.356
You gotta stop thinking
about this like Nora's dad

27:32.440 --> 27:34.591
and start thinking about it
like a CSI.

27:34.680 --> 27:37.070
Please?

27:37.160 --> 27:39.595
Don't do it for me.
Do it for her.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.631
Didn't I tell you
to get lost?

27:52.720 --> 27:54.439
Yes, you did.
Thanks for that.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.352
Gave us time
to pull your file.

27:56.440 --> 27:59.558
You don't have any priors,
but I did find about

27:59.640 --> 28:01.711
a dozen outstanding parking
tickets, though.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.200
Oh, no.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.953
For, uh, what was it?
It was, um...

28:05.040 --> 28:07.191
Oh, yeah, a Lamborghini.

28:07.280 --> 28:10.034
Hmm. Vroom, vroom.

28:10.120 --> 28:14.160
How does a civil servant afford
a $200,000 car?

28:14.240 --> 28:15.959
Okay,
I'm calling security.

28:16.040 --> 28:17.040
Please do.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.040
I can't wait to report a case
of insurance fraud.

28:19.080 --> 28:21.296
You've been telling citizens
their claims have been denied

28:21.320 --> 28:22.959
and then pocketing the cash
for yourself

28:23.040 --> 28:24.160
when the government pays up.

28:24.200 --> 28:26.760
That's why this FEMA center's
emptier than Grandma's whiskey

28:26.840 --> 28:28.035
at a Dibny Christmas dinner.

28:28.120 --> 28:30.157
You can't prove any of this.

28:30.240 --> 28:31.720
Try me.

28:35.000 --> 28:36.798
That's everyone.

28:36.880 --> 28:39.031
Names, addresses, location
the night of the crash.

28:39.120 --> 28:42.158
So... this is gonna stay
between us?

28:42.280 --> 28:44.920
You've been profiting
off of innocent victims.

28:45.000 --> 28:46.639
You know I put a call
into your superiors

28:46.720 --> 28:48.871
in D.C. 20 minutes ago.

28:48.960 --> 28:51.031
I got my groove back, Vancey.

28:51.120 --> 28:53.874
That's how I know it's you
that's scared and not me.

28:54.000 --> 28:56.231
Now there's the old
Ce-Seal-Your-Fate Horton

28:56.320 --> 28:57.840
- we all know and love.
- Vroom, vroom.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.070
Hmm.

29:57.320 --> 29:59.073
Hey.

29:59.160 --> 30:01.800
If you came to defend Cisco,
please don't bother.

30:01.880 --> 30:03.997
He just cares about you.

30:04.080 --> 30:05.336
Come on, don't you think
I would know

30:05.360 --> 30:07.317
if that wasn't
actually my father?

30:09.040 --> 30:10.269
You too? Really?

30:10.360 --> 30:14.195
Listen, I wanted to believe
that that's your dad

30:14.280 --> 30:16.636
and that he's a good guy
because I want you to be happy.

30:16.720 --> 30:19.030
But I don't... I don't know.

30:19.120 --> 30:20.998
Maybe I haven't
been seeing clearly.

30:21.080 --> 30:23.549
There is a lot about this guy's
story that doesn't add up.

30:23.640 --> 30:26.314
This guy?
This guy is my father.

30:26.400 --> 30:28.596
He's the man who held me
when I had chickenpox.

30:28.720 --> 30:30.552
Who told me I could be
anything I wanted to

30:30.680 --> 30:32.592
and made me believe it.

30:32.680 --> 30:35.559
So please stop treating him
like he's a criminal.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.393
Okay.

30:37.520 --> 30:39.796
You know how estranged
I am from my mother

30:39.880 --> 30:43.794
and how empty I felt
without Killer Frost.

30:43.880 --> 30:47.351
He is the only family
that I have left.

30:47.440 --> 30:50.911
But Caitlin, that's not true.
We're your family too.

30:51.000 --> 30:53.993
And we're only asking you
to keep an open mind

30:54.120 --> 30:56.077
because we care about you.

30:56.160 --> 30:57.753
Especially Cisco.

31:02.080 --> 31:03.400
If it'll make you
feel better,

31:03.480 --> 31:04.680
you can ask him
your questions,

31:04.720 --> 31:06.916
but only after
I give him the serum.

31:09.920 --> 31:11.718
<i>- What's wrong?</i>
- Oh, my God.

31:11.800 --> 31:12.916
What?

31:14.880 --> 31:17.520
If I give this serum
to a human,

31:17.600 --> 31:20.069
it will suppress
their malignant side.

31:20.160 --> 31:23.551
But if I give it to
a cryogenic meta-human,

31:23.640 --> 31:25.996
it will permanently suppress
their human side.

31:26.080 --> 31:27.719
If that's your father's
alter ego...

31:27.800 --> 31:29.120
He's trying to wipe out
my dad.

31:29.240 --> 31:31.471
He needed your cells
to make the serum.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.433
"Caitlin, come find me."

31:39.920 --> 31:41.354
Caity.

31:41.440 --> 31:42.476
What's going on?

31:42.560 --> 31:45.519
Dad, why?

31:45.600 --> 31:50.550
Well... I guess,
as you're all here...

31:54.680 --> 31:57.798
You have such smart
friends, Caity.

32:02.120 --> 32:03.793
That frozen liquid
in your lungs

32:03.880 --> 32:06.679
<i>is gonna be turning
into tiny icicles.</i>

32:06.760 --> 32:09.559
Making it very difficult
for you to breathe.

32:09.640 --> 32:12.030
<i>But no worries.</i>

32:12.120 --> 32:14.430
You'll pass out soon.

32:32.360 --> 32:34.511
Caitlin. Hey!

32:34.600 --> 32:37.115
Caitlin, wake up.

32:37.200 --> 32:39.476
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

32:39.600 --> 32:41.114
Um, is my dad gone?

32:41.200 --> 32:42.634
He took the serum.

32:42.720 --> 32:43.915
This is all my fault.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.832
I was so excited
to have my dad back

32:45.920 --> 32:48.480
that I... I couldn't see
who he really was.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.358
I owe you both an apology.

32:50.440 --> 32:53.558
Hey, it's okay.

32:53.640 --> 32:55.518
We'll get him.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.273
<i>Hey, guys, get in here.</i>

32:57.360 --> 32:59.511
Come on.

32:59.600 --> 33:02.035
Guys, please.

33:02.120 --> 33:03.395
- What?
- He's at the DOD site.

33:03.480 --> 33:04.516
Look.

33:04.600 --> 33:05.600
That building's 7 below?

33:05.640 --> 33:07.136
Look at the temperature.
Look at it drop.

33:07.160 --> 33:08.256
He initiated
the negative array

33:08.280 --> 33:09.714
but didn't seal it.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.911
The room is -7,
but the array is -100.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.096
That thing's
so freaking cold,

33:13.120 --> 33:14.176
it's freezing
the whole building.

33:14.200 --> 33:15.296
Wait, at this rate,
in 5 minutes,

33:15.320 --> 33:17.232
the temperature will be
- 460 degrees,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.320
AKA absolute zero.

33:18.360 --> 33:20.400
At which point, he can
inject himself with my serum.

33:20.440 --> 33:22.875
And turn himself into
a full-on icicle.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.679
Icicle, that's...
not the time.

33:24.760 --> 33:25.936
<i>- We gotta go.</i>
- Let's do it.

33:25.960 --> 33:28.714
Hey, what...
what about your hands?

33:28.800 --> 33:32.760
You're my friend, my family.
I'm going.

33:40.200 --> 33:41.600
Almost there.

33:47.640 --> 33:50.075
Ugh... Flash.

33:50.160 --> 33:53.551
Don't you realize
that speed and cold don't mix?

33:53.640 --> 33:56.439
<i>This machine is capable
of producing isotopes</i>

33:56.520 --> 33:59.752
that can freeze carbon dioxide.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.832
You can't run in here.

34:04.960 --> 34:07.156
More superheroes to freeze.

34:07.240 --> 34:09.708
<i>The array's at -220.
You have one minute.</i>

34:09.800 --> 34:12.076
You people are not
as smart as I thought.

34:12.159 --> 34:13.230
Guys, what's happening?

34:13.360 --> 34:14.536
The temperature in the room
is dropping.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.760
Everyone's so cold, their atoms
are hitting near stasis.

34:16.800 --> 34:19.599
Why... why can't I see
my breath?

34:19.679 --> 34:22.991
It's too cold.
There's no moisture in the air.

34:25.520 --> 34:26.840
Cisco, are you okay?

34:26.920 --> 34:29.674
No. At least
I can't feel anything.

34:29.760 --> 34:31.911
<i>Guys, the array's
at -350 degrees.</i>

34:32.000 --> 34:33.672
He's gonna be able to go
full Icicle soon.

34:34.960 --> 34:35.960
Come on.

34:36.040 --> 34:38.315
- Forty-five seconds.
- What do we do?

34:38.400 --> 34:39.516
Lightning.

34:39.600 --> 34:41.056
<i>Use your lightning
to counter the cold</i>

34:41.080 --> 34:42.656
and maybe you can warm up
enough to stop him.

34:42.679 --> 34:44.399
We've been trying to do it
this whole time.

34:44.480 --> 34:45.675
It's too cold.

34:45.760 --> 34:47.991
I'm literally fr... freezing.

34:48.080 --> 34:49.719
<i>399, you have 30 seconds.</i>

34:49.800 --> 34:50.856
Your temperature
is dropping too quickly.

34:50.880 --> 34:52.416
You're gonna go into
hypothermic shock soon.

34:52.440 --> 34:53.760
But not Caitlin.

34:53.840 --> 34:56.560
Look, Caitlin's body
temperature is normal.

34:56.639 --> 34:57.994
<i>Caitlin, you must be immune.</i>

34:58.080 --> 34:59.594
But Killer Frost is gone.

34:59.680 --> 35:01.956
Well, clearly, she's not.

35:02.040 --> 35:03.235
<i>Guys, 400 degrees.</i>

35:03.320 --> 35:04.720
We got 20 seconds.

35:04.800 --> 35:07.235
Caitlin, you can do it.

35:07.320 --> 35:08.959
Just concentrate.

35:11.440 --> 35:12.590
Dad!

35:13.560 --> 35:16.394
Please,
I know you're in there.

35:16.480 --> 35:17.994
Don't do this.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.720
Do you think Thomas
can hear you, Caity?

35:21.960 --> 35:26.637
Thomas hasn't been able to hear
anything for a very long time.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.520
- What is that?
- 460 degrees. We're too late.

35:34.600 --> 35:36.353
<i>He beat us.</i>

35:38.040 --> 35:39.474
No!

35:47.000 --> 35:49.560
<i>My daughter.
You've returned!</i>

35:51.240 --> 35:52.356
You're not my family.

35:52.440 --> 35:53.635
They are.

35:53.720 --> 35:56.360
You only gave a damn about me
because you wanted that serum.

35:56.440 --> 35:58.636
But I... I can share it
with you.

35:58.720 --> 35:59.790
Just imagine.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.237
The two of us, free to be
ourselves without fear.

36:03.320 --> 36:04.913
You are strong.

36:05.000 --> 36:07.560
We can be even stronger
together.

36:07.640 --> 36:10.519
I'm strong because I have
people in my life

36:10.600 --> 36:12.478
who actually care about me.

36:12.560 --> 36:15.075
Do you?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.514
No!

36:22.240 --> 36:23.240
No!

36:34.680 --> 36:36.751
Caity?

36:36.880 --> 36:39.315
- Dad?
- You found me?

36:55.280 --> 36:56.999
Temperature's rising.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.594
What's happening?
Is everyone okay?

36:58.680 --> 37:00.637
<i>- I think so.
- A little help?</i>

37:00.720 --> 37:02.632
Get Cisco.

37:05.560 --> 37:07.279
Oh, yeah.
That's good.

37:07.360 --> 37:09.397
Yeah.

37:09.480 --> 37:10.675
Okay.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.792
My dad.

37:16.920 --> 37:18.320
Our dad.

37:18.400 --> 37:24.078
He was here, but... I lost him.

37:24.160 --> 37:26.994
We'll get him back.
Together.

37:27.080 --> 37:28.560
You're not alone anymore.

37:35.400 --> 37:36.754
Neither am I.

37:47.800 --> 37:49.632
No cold signatures
in the area.

37:49.720 --> 37:51.916
Snow Country for Old Men
must be miles away,

37:52.000 --> 37:53.696
'cause he sure as hell
isn't in Central City.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.279
Well, we have to find him.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.920
I mean, Icicle wouldn't have
gone to all this trouble

37:58.000 --> 38:00.595
to kill my Dad if there wasn't
a piece of him still left.

38:00.680 --> 38:03.070
We'll find him.

38:03.160 --> 38:06.312
All the things I vibed, they
weren't memories of your dad.

38:06.400 --> 38:08.073
They were of his alter ego.

38:08.160 --> 38:10.959
My dad was trying
to protect me.

38:11.040 --> 38:14.351
You know what?
My mom probably was too.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.909
<i>I mean, she was just trying
to keep me safe.</i>

38:17.000 --> 38:19.276
All this time, I thought
she was the villain.

38:19.400 --> 38:21.198
How could I not see
it was him?

38:21.280 --> 38:23.351
Hey, don't beat yourself up.

38:23.440 --> 38:25.557
Thawne. Zolomon.

38:25.640 --> 38:27.836
We see the good in people.
That's just who we are.

38:27.920 --> 38:30.799
I hope that never changes.

38:30.880 --> 38:32.917
There's something else
you guys should see.

38:36.760 --> 38:39.070
All this time, we've been
trying to figure out

38:39.160 --> 38:41.038
how Killer Frost disappeared,

38:41.120 --> 38:44.477
but we've been looking at it
all wrong.

38:44.560 --> 38:47.234
We've been thinking DeVoe
used Melting Point's powers,

38:47.320 --> 38:49.198
that he changed your meta DNA

38:49.280 --> 38:51.556
and removed Killer Frost
from you.

38:51.680 --> 38:54.878
But tonight, you proved
that she's still a part of you.

38:54.960 --> 38:57.873
So what caused her to leave?

38:57.960 --> 39:00.794
DeVoe used a different set
of powers.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.349
- Brainstorm.
- Brainstorm.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.456
All that he did
was create a mental block.

39:05.480 --> 39:07.336
One you broke through tonight,
so you can do that again.

39:07.360 --> 39:10.717
You just gotta learn how.

39:10.800 --> 39:13.110
I think it's time
we reintroduce an old friend.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.875
Harry's mental activity
dampener.

39:18.000 --> 39:19.878
It'll help me hear her.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.400
<i>That's right.</i>

39:21.480 --> 39:23.711
It's my hope that
the more you use it,

39:23.800 --> 39:25.996
the more you connect with her.

39:26.080 --> 39:28.515
Eventually, you won't
need it anymore.

39:28.600 --> 39:30.876
Thank you.

39:30.960 --> 39:34.476
<i>Guys, we need you
in the Speed Lab.</i>

39:34.600 --> 39:37.957
All right.
We'll leave you to it.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.230
<i>Hey, stranger.</i>

39:51.320 --> 39:52.879
Hey.

39:52.960 --> 39:55.555
<i>Well, we sure have
a lot to talk about.</i>

40:00.040 --> 40:03.829
Oh! Sally's heart!

40:03.960 --> 40:05.917
You brought it back.

40:06.000 --> 40:08.390
We did, thanks to these two

40:08.480 --> 40:10.517
and their deductive abilities.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.557
And our
tidal-wave-breaking skills.

40:12.680 --> 40:13.816
- Right?
- Like mother, like daughter.

40:13.840 --> 40:15.069
Mm-hmm.

40:15.160 --> 40:17.629
Uh, is it safe
for this to be here?

40:17.720 --> 40:20.280
Yeah, a little dark matter
never hurt anybody.

40:20.360 --> 40:21.794
What?

40:21.880 --> 40:23.553
We've seen
this puzzle piece before.

40:23.640 --> 40:27.350
Our satellite giveth,
and now we must taketh away.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.636
I think we can
finally do that.

40:29.720 --> 40:31.816
We got a list from FEMA of
everyone who reported injuries

40:31.840 --> 40:33.040
<i>the night
of the Enlightenment.</i>

40:33.120 --> 40:34.656
None of them matched
Cicada's description.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.796
<i>But there were three kids</i>

40:35.880 --> 40:38.111
who were hit by pieces
of shrapnel from the satellite.

40:38.200 --> 40:40.351
Two of them are twins
whose father is deceased.

40:40.440 --> 40:41.840
<i>Third is a ten-year-old girl,</i>

40:41.920 --> 40:43.593
by the name of Grace Gibbons.

40:43.680 --> 40:46.240
So if my dad's right
and Cicada's a father, then...

40:46.320 --> 40:48.676
We may have just found
his daughter.

40:55.320 --> 40:56.834
Orlin?

41:03.840 --> 41:05.240
Orlin.

41:17.440 --> 41:20.000
After I fix up your side,
I'm gonna patch up your chest.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.713
No.

41:32.280 --> 41:35.432
It's making me stronger.

42:03.120 --> 42:04.520
<i>Greg, move your head.</i>
