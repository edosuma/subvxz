00:21.729 --> 00:23.166
You were told what would happen

00:23.167 --> 00:24.703
if you came back here.

00:35.614 --> 00:37.857
Hmm. The last time I saw you in your P.J.s
after 8:00 A.M.,

00:37.858 --> 00:39.363
I think you were 4.

00:39.364 --> 00:40.456
We're off today.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.692
Teachers' retreat.

00:42.508 --> 00:44.136
I didn't feel like getting dressed.

00:44.137 --> 00:47.417
This wouldn't have anything
to do with Ashley, would it?

00:49.197 --> 00:50.643
Did I do the right thing,

00:50.644 --> 00:51.654
breaking up with him?

00:51.655 --> 00:53.400
Oh, sweetie. I don't know.

00:53.401 --> 00:55.196
That's something only you can answer.

00:55.563 --> 00:56.240
It sucks.

00:57.095 --> 00:58.180
I miss him a lot.

00:58.548 --> 01:00.222
Yeah, well, you're not
doing yourself any favors,

01:00.223 --> 01:01.408
sitting around reading
"Pride and Prejudice."

01:01.409 --> 01:02.719
That's just gonna make it worse.

01:02.720 --> 01:04.171
You might as well be listening to Adele.

01:04.172 --> 01:07.858
Hey, she totally gets it,
and so does Jane Austen.

01:08.564 --> 01:09.486
You know what you need?

01:10.081 --> 01:10.888
A new life?

01:10.889 --> 01:12.398
A distraction.

01:12.399 --> 01:13.089
And it just so happens,

01:13.090 --> 01:16.465
I know the perfect post-breakup routine.

01:16.466 --> 01:17.410
Tonight you and I

01:17.411 --> 01:19.534
go get chili-cheese dogs
from gray's papaya.

01:19.535 --> 01:22.464
We smuggle them into a double
feature at the Angelika.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.129
I know you mean well,

01:24.130 --> 01:26.755
but I don't think going out
with my dad is going to...

01:26.756 --> 01:27.917
make me feel better.

01:27.918 --> 01:30.424
Well, how about just a low-key
evening with your girlfriends?

01:30.425 --> 01:31.649
You guys can have a John Hughes' marathon

01:31.650 --> 01:33.009
and fill out a "Cosmo" quiz.

01:33.010 --> 01:35.850
Dad, the '80s just called.
It wants its plan back.

01:35.851 --> 01:37.389
Come on. Gram's upstate.

01:37.390 --> 01:39.656
She's doing some spa retreat.
She'll be out of your hair.

01:39.657 --> 01:40.853
And I can make myself scarce.

01:40.854 --> 01:43.437
A few of my friends have been
suggesting a girls' night.

01:44.709 --> 01:45.607
Maybe I'll call 'em.

01:45.608 --> 01:47.500
No maybe. You're going to call them,

01:47.501 --> 01:49.064
and you're going to have a great time.

01:50.739 --> 01:53.029
And if that's the '80s, tell
them they can have "Cosmo"...

01:53.030 --> 01:54.669
But I'm keeping John Hughes.

01:54.670 --> 01:55.776
And if it's Beckett?

02:05.386 --> 02:06.028
Thank you.

02:07.180 --> 02:09.364
Ooh. The Sapphire. In Atlantic City?

02:09.365 --> 02:11.346
I love that place. All right.
Who's our victim?

02:11.347 --> 02:13.923
Is it a showgirl, some
big-money high roller?

02:13.924 --> 02:16.231
No, our victim is Sam Siegel,

02:16.232 --> 02:18.483
co-owner of the Sapphire,

02:18.484 --> 02:19.994
where you're always a winner.

02:19.995 --> 02:22.020
Yeah, not always, by the looks of things.

02:22.021 --> 02:24.809
Guy cashed in his chips
between 9:00 and 11:00.

02:24.810 --> 02:26.791
Took a small caliber to the chest.

02:26.792 --> 02:29.534
Muzzle flash burned his shirt
at the point of entry.

02:29.535 --> 02:30.852
The shooter was standing close.

02:30.853 --> 02:33.038
Mm-hmm. Close enough to
give him a bloody lip

02:33.039 --> 02:34.182
before pulling the trigger.

02:34.183 --> 02:35.600
So what's a guy like Siegel doing in

02:35.601 --> 02:37.817
an abandoned delivery dock in New York City

02:37.818 --> 02:38.550
at that time of night?

02:38.551 --> 02:40.051
Must have been something important enough

02:40.052 --> 02:42.094
for him to drive down from Atlantic City.

02:42.578 --> 02:44.564
You know, the man owned a casino.

02:45.075 --> 02:46.615
A guy like that, you'd
think he'd have a driver.

02:46.616 --> 02:48.818
Especially since he was expecting trouble.

02:48.819 --> 02:49.612
He came heavy.

02:50.016 --> 02:51.361
It's a .357 Magnum

02:51.362 --> 02:53.366
with all six still asleep in the cylinder.

02:53.367 --> 02:54.815
He didn't even pull it
out of the glove box.

02:54.816 --> 02:56.669
If he did.
We'd be standing over the other guy.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.332
Yeah, you gotta know when to hold 'em

02:58.333 --> 02:59.859
and know when to fold 'em.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.050
Know when to walk away,
and know when to run.

03:02.409 --> 03:03.719
Got it. Detective Esposito,

03:03.720 --> 03:06.999
a little respect, please.
I mean, there is a dead body here.

03:07.000 --> 03:07.746
What'd I do?

03:09.796 --> 03:11.229
You broke up with her.

03:11.230 --> 03:13.165
We broke up with each other.
That's different.

03:13.166 --> 03:14.467
Yeah, you'd think it'd be different,

03:14.468 --> 03:16.134
but no. Will you tell him?

03:16.135 --> 03:17.962
No, I told you.
I'm staying out of this one.

03:19.931 --> 03:20.519
All right, guys,

03:20.520 --> 03:22.613
call the Sapphire, get
some background on Siegel,

03:22.614 --> 03:23.765
and look for surveillance cameras

03:23.766 --> 03:25.657
or security guards that
might have seen something.

03:26.322 --> 03:26.986
Women.

03:27.368 --> 03:29.082
You sure you want to spend the
rest of your life with one?

03:29.083 --> 03:30.854
Uh, yeah. Mine likes me.

03:31.288 --> 03:33.884
Ooh, speaking of Atlantic City,

03:33.885 --> 03:36.115
perfect place for a bachelor party.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.141
Ooh. That's what I'm talking about, bro.

03:38.142 --> 03:39.394
We could rent one of these right here,

03:39.395 --> 03:40.955
hit the casino, maybe the club.

03:40.956 --> 03:44.327
Uh, I-I was thinking more
along the lines of...

03:44.328 --> 03:45.159
Camping trip.

03:45.160 --> 03:45.711
Huh?

03:46.419 --> 03:48.155
Oh, you were... oh.

03:48.156 --> 03:49.364
Uh, first of all,

03:49.365 --> 03:50.462
no.

03:50.463 --> 03:52.367
Second, it's not up to you.

03:52.875 --> 03:55.945
The bachelor party is
strictly best man territory.

03:55.946 --> 03:57.896
And by the way, your big date is what,

03:57.897 --> 03:59.879
like two months away?

03:59.880 --> 04:01.258
So you need to officially tell the guy

04:01.259 --> 04:03.784
so that he can start planning something.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.474
I still got some time.

04:06.475 --> 04:08.524
Um, I-I'm gonna go check on those cameras.

04:09.558 --> 04:10.257
What the...

04:10.842 --> 04:11.726
Did you see that?

04:12.782 --> 04:13.933
He just sidestepped me.

04:14.944 --> 04:16.036
What's that about?

04:16.038 --> 04:17.473
It's almost as though
the thought of marriage

04:17.474 --> 04:19.894
fills him with an impending sense of doom.

04:20.209 --> 04:21.697
Oh, no, wait. That's me.

04:29.038 --> 04:29.892
Nav system?

04:30.346 --> 04:32.145
Yeah, and it looks like Siegel made a stop

04:32.146 --> 04:33.780
just before he got here.

04:34.401 --> 04:36.381
537 West End Avenue.

04:36.382 --> 04:38.959
Looks like Sam's got a
friend here in Manhattan.

04:39.473 --> 04:41.544
Sam Siegel, 46 years old,

04:41.545 --> 04:43.095
got his start in real estate development,

04:43.096 --> 04:44.148
and then he went on to launch

04:44.149 --> 04:46.712
the Sapphire Coast Resort
and Casino in 1999.

04:46.713 --> 04:48.149
You don't come to be a casino owner

04:48.150 --> 04:48.986
without making enemies.

04:48.987 --> 04:50.474
Look at Moe Greene in "The Godfather."

04:50.475 --> 04:52.256
And this guy seems to
be a stand-up citizen.

04:52.257 --> 04:53.841
He has a foundation that gives money to

04:53.842 --> 04:55.824
charities and public schools.

04:55.825 --> 04:57.722
All right, check with the
staff at the casino.

04:57.723 --> 04:59.383
See if he had any meetings
here in Manhattan

04:59.384 --> 05:01.567
and find out what time
he left Atlantic City.

05:01.568 --> 05:02.458
All right.

05:03.535 --> 05:04.957
You know, if someone asked to meet me

05:04.958 --> 05:06.732
at an abandoned warehouse
in the dead of night,

05:07.180 --> 05:07.975
I'd pass.

05:07.976 --> 05:09.906
I've written that scene enough
times to know how it ends.

05:09.907 --> 05:12.287
Hey, that address that was on Siegel's GPS?

05:12.288 --> 05:15.081
Turns out it's a building where
his ex-wife Rebecca lives.

05:15.082 --> 05:16.320
How long have they been divorced?

05:16.321 --> 05:17.145
About six months.

05:17.146 --> 05:18.838
Recent enough for there to
still be hard feelings.

05:18.839 --> 05:19.846
Mm. Well, according to the neighbors,

05:19.847 --> 05:20.983
very hard feelings.

05:20.984 --> 05:23.246
There was a report of a
loud argument last night,

05:23.247 --> 05:24.886
and neighbors said they saw
Siegel leaving her place

05:24.887 --> 05:26.086
just after 8:30.

05:26.087 --> 05:27.772
That's just before he was killed.

05:27.773 --> 05:29.915
Yeah, we argued, but I didn't kill him.

05:30.381 --> 05:32.653
Was it normal for him to come
and see you after the divorce?

05:32.654 --> 05:33.376
No.

05:34.769 --> 05:36.633
In fact, I hadn't seen him in months.

05:36.634 --> 05:38.768
We don't really get along anymore.

05:38.769 --> 05:40.315
What were the two of you fighting about?

05:43.821 --> 05:45.157
Ms. Siegel?

05:45.158 --> 05:46.258
He said he was in trouble.

05:47.681 --> 05:48.433
What kind of trouble?

05:48.434 --> 05:49.096
He wouldn't say,

05:49.097 --> 05:51.780
but he wanted me to sign
over an investment property

05:51.781 --> 05:53.601
that was still in both of our names--

05:53.602 --> 05:55.220
a building here in Queens,

05:56.057 --> 05:57.293
just a store and some apartments.

05:57.294 --> 05:59.039
I don't know why, but...

05:59.040 --> 06:01.182
He was very worked up about it.

06:01.183 --> 06:02.306
He offered me $1.5 million

06:02.307 --> 06:05.143
for my share, which is as much
as the whole place was worth.

06:05.906 --> 06:08.077
He said his life depended on it.

06:10.287 --> 06:11.436
So this building...

06:12.258 --> 06:14.042
He offered you full price

06:14.043 --> 06:17.650
of $1.5 million instead of
half, and you still said no?

06:17.651 --> 06:20.002
I didn't know.
I thought he was working an angle.

06:21.578 --> 06:24.229
I told him I couldn't sign
anything without my lawyer.

06:24.803 --> 06:26.780
And after Sam left your place last night,

06:26.781 --> 06:27.571
what'd you did?

06:28.689 --> 06:31.043
I was in my apartment for
the rest of the evening.

06:33.860 --> 06:36.333
So the doorman confirms
the ex-wife's story.

06:36.334 --> 06:38.121
She was in her apartment all night.

06:38.122 --> 06:39.163
Detective Beckett,

06:39.164 --> 06:41.889
I just received a call from
the mayor of Atlantic City.

06:41.890 --> 06:43.851
Mr. Siegel's death is front-page news.

06:43.852 --> 06:45.113
They're asking about suspects.

06:45.114 --> 06:46.208
Yes, sir. So are we.

06:46.209 --> 06:47.413
Well, how about the property

06:47.414 --> 06:49.006
he asked his ex to sign over to him?

06:49.007 --> 06:50.073
Anything on that?

06:50.074 --> 06:52.865
Um, just that the victim purchased it

06:52.866 --> 06:53.911
a year and a half ago

06:53.912 --> 06:54.981
and paid cash for the full amount.

06:54.982 --> 06:56.928
Yeah, the real estate agent was
surprised anyone bought it.

06:56.929 --> 06:59.647
It had been on the market for...
quite a while.

06:59.648 --> 07:01.371
Just got off the phone
with Sam Siegel's office.

07:01.372 --> 07:04.313
Apparently, he didn't leave
Atlantic City alone last night.

07:04.314 --> 07:06.144
There was no indication of
a passenger in his car.

07:06.145 --> 07:07.211
Not a passenger.

07:07.631 --> 07:08.559
A driver.

07:08.797 --> 07:12.719
Around 6:30, one of Sam's
regular drivers, Ralph Marino,

07:12.720 --> 07:13.860
picked him up in front of the casino

07:13.861 --> 07:14.793
and drove him to New York City.

07:14.794 --> 07:16.020
And where is he now?

07:16.021 --> 07:17.668
No one knows.
He didn't show up for work today.

07:17.669 --> 07:19.606
Which means he's either
floating in the Hudson...

07:19.607 --> 07:20.914
Or he's involved.

07:20.915 --> 07:22.553
Well, what do we know about Mr. Marino?

07:22.554 --> 07:24.093
Well, he's no boy scout, that's for sure.

07:24.094 --> 07:25.829
Background check shows felony racketeering

07:25.830 --> 07:27.295
and assault charges.

07:27.296 --> 07:28.928
Put out an all points on Ralph Marino.

07:28.929 --> 07:31.287
I'll have our brethren in
Atlantic City do the same.

07:31.288 --> 07:32.708
You boys head down to Atlantic City

07:32.709 --> 07:34.212
to Siegel's casino.

07:34.213 --> 07:36.140
Talk to Marino's friends and coworkers

07:36.141 --> 07:39.184
and see if any of them can shine
some light on his whereabouts.

07:39.185 --> 07:40.156
Meanwhile, Beckett,

07:40.157 --> 07:43.052
you run point from here, get
unis canvassing for Marino,

07:43.053 --> 07:45.543
and figure out why in the
hell Siegel was so desperate

07:45.544 --> 07:47.621
to get control over that
property in Queens.

07:47.622 --> 07:49.393
Yes, sir. Come on, Castle.

07:49.899 --> 07:50.942
Oh, uh, captain gates said

07:50.943 --> 07:52.583
the boys are going to Atlantic City.

07:52.584 --> 07:54.499
Yeah, I don't think she meant you.

07:54.500 --> 07:56.957
Actually, that's my call.

07:56.958 --> 07:57.707
You're with them.

08:02.366 --> 08:04.106
Besides, detective,

08:04.107 --> 08:06.706
I'm looking forward to seeing
what you can do without him.

08:15.214 --> 08:16.388
What are you doing?

08:16.389 --> 08:17.536
What does it look like?

08:17.958 --> 08:19.792
Did you think I was gonna
pass up a road trip

08:19.793 --> 08:21.962
to the Boardwalk Empire,

08:21.963 --> 08:24.858
the east coast epicenter
of dancing, gambling,

08:24.859 --> 08:26.012
showgirls, and sin?

08:26.013 --> 08:27.663
You do realize, we're going
there to investigate a murder,

08:27.664 --> 08:28.471
don't you?

08:28.472 --> 08:30.780
Gentlemen, if I have learned one thing,

08:30.781 --> 08:33.177
it's to not let a little thing like murder

08:33.178 --> 08:34.962
get in the way of having a good time.

08:35.779 --> 08:37.793
And also, shotgun.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.369
Hey, Alexis. I hope you're not answering

08:48.370 --> 08:51.249
because you are busy
planning your girls' night.

08:51.250 --> 08:52.845
Anyway, I'm going out of town on a case,

08:52.846 --> 08:55.497
and we may just be spending the night.

08:55.498 --> 08:56.979
Yeah. So I'll call and I'll check on you.

08:56.980 --> 08:57.796
Love you. Bye.

08:57.797 --> 09:00.082
Come on, Castle.
We are not spending the night.

09:00.083 --> 09:01.278
How can you say that?

09:01.279 --> 09:03.048
And maybe Ralph Marino will
be very difficult to find,

09:03.049 --> 09:05.173
and I think we should start
looking at the craps tables.

09:05.174 --> 09:08.687
Yeah. Oh, I'm starting to
understand why you ditched Beckett.

09:08.688 --> 09:10.498
A-and for the record,
the one guy in this car

09:10.499 --> 09:13.017
who's not a real cop is not
allowed to call shotgun.

09:13.018 --> 09:14.039
Called it fair and square.

09:14.400 --> 09:15.212
Maybe Castle's right.

09:15.213 --> 09:17.370
I mean, if--since we're gonna be there,

09:17.371 --> 09:18.786
we might as well consider the Sapphire

09:18.787 --> 09:20.853
as a potential bachelor party venue.

09:20.854 --> 09:23.159
I'm so happy you said
that, because there are

09:23.160 --> 09:25.222
a number of establishments down there

09:25.223 --> 09:26.620
that cater to bachelor party events.

09:26.621 --> 09:28.054
I think maybe we should
take a little sampling.

09:28.055 --> 09:29.199
No, no, no.

09:29.200 --> 09:31.800
We are not sampling any clubs.

09:31.801 --> 09:32.714
What?

09:32.715 --> 09:34.785
Come on, bro.
Why are you stalling us on this?

09:35.177 --> 09:36.615
Look, Javier, I-I...

09:37.474 --> 09:38.774
I got some bad news.

09:40.389 --> 09:42.563
I had to ask Jenny's half-brother Nelson

09:42.564 --> 09:43.839
to be my best man.

09:48.139 --> 09:48.861
Nelson?

09:50.852 --> 09:52.466
That guy I met at your birthday party?

09:52.965 --> 09:55.583
16, with braces, couldn't stop
talking about being a mathlete.

09:55.584 --> 09:57.655
It was a family thing.
I-I didn't have a choice.

09:57.656 --> 09:58.594
Yeah, you did.

09:59.339 --> 10:01.037
No, actually, when it comes to weddings,

10:01.038 --> 10:03.060
uh, you don't. Trust me.

10:03.394 --> 10:05.931
You do not want to start a
marriage with a family feud.

10:10.588 --> 10:12.526
This sucks.
I know.

10:13.299 --> 10:14.925
And I was gonna give you
an awesome send-off, bro.

10:15.829 --> 10:17.082
I know.

10:18.427 --> 10:19.943
Well, boys, I'm sorry.

10:20.484 --> 10:21.999
I'm sorry it had to come to this.

10:22.630 --> 10:25.440
I didn't want it to, but it
looks like we have no choice.

10:25.822 --> 10:27.097
There is no other way.

10:28.105 --> 10:29.752
I.B.P.W.O.C.

10:30.083 --> 10:33.159
Impromptu bachelor party while on case.

10:41.314 --> 10:43.049
Ah, you smell that?

10:43.050 --> 10:44.218
That is the smell of hopes,

10:44.219 --> 10:46.450
dreams, and endless opportunities.

10:46.451 --> 10:47.974
Not to be confused with cigarette smoke,

10:47.975 --> 10:49.468
day drinking, and desperation.

10:49.469 --> 10:50.794
Well, that's the great
thing about casinos--

10:50.795 --> 10:53.482
no clocks, no windows, and no judgments.

10:54.204 --> 10:55.417
How you doin'?

10:55.717 --> 10:56.923
Maybe we should stay the night.

10:57.264 --> 10:58.258
What?

10:58.852 --> 11:00.164
Detective Ryan, NYPD.

11:00.165 --> 11:01.609
I'm here to investigate Mr. Siegel's death.

11:01.610 --> 11:03.059
The concierge is right over there.

11:03.060 --> 11:04.366
Nadine.

11:07.033 --> 11:08.822
Gentlemen, welcome to the Sapphire.

11:08.823 --> 11:10.377
I'm Nadine, the personal concierge.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.818
We're all devastated to learn about Sam.

11:13.149 --> 11:15.496
We're supposed to meet Sam's
business partner--- Charlie Turner.

11:15.497 --> 11:17.460
We need to talk to him about
one of your employees.

11:17.461 --> 11:19.940
He asked me to escort you to his table.
Follow me.

11:20.300 --> 11:21.897
And if you have any other
questions about the hotel,

11:21.898 --> 11:23.095
don't hesitate to ask.

11:23.096 --> 11:24.282
Uh, actually, now that you mention it,

11:24.283 --> 11:27.554
I'm curious, who's playing
on the main stage?

11:27.976 --> 11:30.194
Just in case we have time
to squeeze in a show.

11:30.756 --> 11:31.741
Well, we're hosting

11:31.742 --> 11:33.707
an Elvis impersonators
convention this weekend,

11:33.708 --> 11:35.808
so we're only featuring carrot top.

11:35.809 --> 11:38.093
Carrot top? I haven't seen him perform

11:38.094 --> 11:39.445
since his crazy makeover.

11:39.446 --> 11:41.012
It'll be like a new show.

11:42.047 --> 11:44.600
Well? Uh, no luck so far on Marino.

11:44.601 --> 11:46.757
A.C.P.D. said that he's
not at his apartment,

11:46.758 --> 11:48.434
nothing turned up on the canvass.

11:48.435 --> 11:50.233
What about the building in Queens?

11:50.234 --> 11:52.982
Well, online search shows that
there's no liens or lawsuits,

11:52.983 --> 11:55.241
so there doesn't seem to be
anything unusual about it.

11:55.242 --> 11:56.426
Keep digging.

11:57.017 --> 11:57.627
Mm-hmm.

11:57.628 --> 11:59.354
Uh, look, detective,

11:59.355 --> 12:01.735
I know you're probably
thinking that I have you here

12:01.736 --> 12:03.149
as some kind of punishment.

12:03.962 --> 12:06.310
You're a good cop, but I
think you can be better

12:06.311 --> 12:08.900
if you minimize the distractions.

12:17.161 --> 12:18.918
Hell of a thing, losing Sam.

12:19.268 --> 12:21.447
You know, he and I started out
in this business together?

12:21.448 --> 12:23.352
We built this place from the ground up.

12:23.353 --> 12:25.230
Do you have any idea what
Sam was doing in New York?

12:26.022 --> 12:27.789
Wasn't like him. He hated the city.

12:27.790 --> 12:29.245
Yo, Tommy.

12:30.220 --> 12:31.104
Good to see you back.

12:31.105 --> 12:32.641
Anything you need, let me know.

12:32.642 --> 12:36.022
You know what I need?
I need my luck to change.

12:36.023 --> 12:37.228
I'm sure it will.

12:39.447 --> 12:41.487
Big whale, lots of dough.

12:41.488 --> 12:43.606
What about Sam's driver
last night--Ralph Marino?

12:43.607 --> 12:44.859
What can you tell us about him?

12:45.221 --> 12:47.337
Not much. He drove me a couple of times.

12:47.819 --> 12:49.996
Here's his personnel file, like you asked.

12:50.328 --> 12:53.161
Honestly, after what happened between them,

12:53.162 --> 12:54.970
I don't know why Sam kept him around.

12:57.108 --> 12:58.282
Well, what happened?

12:58.724 --> 13:00.561
Mr. Turner, sorry to interrupt.

13:01.003 --> 13:02.918
Facial recognition got a
hit on a card counter.

13:02.919 --> 13:04.616
Table six, purple shirt.

13:06.724 --> 13:08.084
Gentlemen, I'd like you to meet

13:08.085 --> 13:10.473
my security tech Daniel Sullivan.

13:10.834 --> 13:13.342
The same software you guys
use to track terrorists,

13:13.693 --> 13:16.152
we use to track low-life thieves.

13:16.553 --> 13:17.956
Security escort, table number six,

13:17.957 --> 13:20.515
purple striped shirt--
guy's counting cards.

13:25.523 --> 13:26.930
Looks like you run a tight ship.

13:27.934 --> 13:29.929
Everybody thinks they can beat the house.

13:29.930 --> 13:32.092
If you don't lay down the
law, they'll rob you blind.

13:32.474 --> 13:34.418
Well, you said something
happened between Ralph and Sam.

13:34.419 --> 13:35.403
What was that?

13:36.548 --> 13:37.290
About a week ago,

13:38.123 --> 13:40.100
the two of them had a scuffle at the bar.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.365
About what? Sam asked this dancer to, uh...

13:44.328 --> 13:45.933
blow on his dice.

13:47.038 --> 13:48.498
Turns out, she was Ralph's girl.

13:48.499 --> 13:49.532
Oops.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.618
Yeah, Sam was always a ladies' man,

13:51.619 --> 13:54.120
and a lot of those ladies
were already spoken for.

13:54.611 --> 13:57.062
It seems like he was on a
little hot streak lately.

13:57.433 --> 13:59.369
But that's the thing about luck, huh?

14:01.979 --> 14:03.043
I won!

14:04.690 --> 14:06.112
It changes.

14:07.248 --> 14:08.783
Thank you very much, Mr. Turner.

14:08.784 --> 14:11.352
We may need to interview some
of your staff while we're here.

14:11.353 --> 14:12.435
Of course.

14:12.436 --> 14:14.502
Nadine can help you with whatever you need.

14:14.503 --> 14:15.927
All right. Thanks.

14:16.992 --> 14:17.964
Guys...

14:18.478 --> 14:21.573
Ralph listed--as his emergency
contact--his cousin.

14:22.505 --> 14:23.610
Guess where he lives.

14:23.611 --> 14:24.245
Where?

14:24.246 --> 14:26.652
New York City.
Eight blocks from our crime scene.

14:26.653 --> 14:28.661
Great place for Ralph to hide out.

14:32.716 --> 14:34.301
Going somewhere, Mr. Marino?

14:35.229 --> 14:36.535
Hey! Hey! Hold it.

14:36.957 --> 14:38.361
Show us your hands, now.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.055
I know how it looks.

14:45.056 --> 14:47.080
But I swear to God and my
mother, I didn't kill him.

14:47.081 --> 14:49.629
That's why you run away
from me with 9-millimeter

14:49.630 --> 14:52.217
tucked in your pants,
'cause you're innocent?

14:52.218 --> 14:53.380
Come on, Ralph.

14:53.381 --> 14:55.313
We know that you and Sam
weren't on the best of terms.

14:55.314 --> 14:57.750
He and I were square.
I would never hurt him.

14:57.751 --> 15:01.193
Look, all I did was drive him.
I wasn't there when he was shot.

15:01.194 --> 15:02.900
Why not? You were his driver.

15:03.361 --> 15:05.449
So what did you do, go
for a midnight stroll?

15:05.840 --> 15:07.546
As a matter of fact, yeah.

15:07.547 --> 15:09.856
A-after he spoke to his ex,
he told me to take him out

15:09.857 --> 15:12.184
to this abandoned warehouse
on the other side of town.

15:12.566 --> 15:14.632
He said there was someone
he needed to meet.

15:14.633 --> 15:16.418
He said he needed to meet him alone.

15:16.419 --> 15:17.823
Who?
Don't know.

15:17.824 --> 15:20.748
Sam gave me 500 bucks, told
me to find my own way home,

15:20.749 --> 15:23.267
so I-I crashed at my cousin's place.

15:23.691 --> 15:26.224
And this morning, I-- I hear
what happened on the radio.

15:26.997 --> 15:30.027
I figured, with my record,
folks would be looking at me.

15:31.493 --> 15:33.943
Did you see anybody else
there before you left?

15:33.944 --> 15:35.756
Black S.U.V. drove up to the dock

15:35.757 --> 15:38.005
just as I was leaving, but I
didn't see who was inside.

15:38.829 --> 15:40.402
Ballistics is checking your 9.

15:40.403 --> 15:42.360
You better hope it's not a match.

15:46.143 --> 15:47.247
What do you think?

15:47.718 --> 15:50.147
I think he's not stupid enough to kill Sam,

15:50.148 --> 15:52.114
knowing it'll just point right back at him.

15:52.917 --> 15:54.450
So Sam drove up to New York

15:54.451 --> 15:57.733
to secure the property in
Queens from his ex-wife

15:58.666 --> 16:01.847
and then went to the docks
to meet with someone.

16:02.771 --> 16:05.042
Sounds like someone was
expecting the property,

16:05.043 --> 16:08.065
and when Sam couldn't
deliver, they killed him.

16:08.515 --> 16:11.316
Why? What's so special about that property?

16:13.021 --> 16:14.113
Ladies, thank you so much.

16:14.114 --> 16:15.645
You have no idea.
These will not go to waste.

16:15.646 --> 16:17.635
Thank you. All right. All right.

16:18.730 --> 16:20.299
It was not easy, but I did it.

16:20.300 --> 16:22.700
I managed to get three front-row seats

16:22.701 --> 16:24.406
to the burlesque show at the Borgata,

16:24.407 --> 16:26.724
also reservations at a premium table

16:27.338 --> 16:28.796
at the X Club with bottle service.

16:28.797 --> 16:31.135
Sweet. What'd you guys come up with?

16:31.136 --> 16:32.873
Well, Sam's assistant didn't know anything

16:32.874 --> 16:33.784
about the property in Queens,

16:33.785 --> 16:35.639
but she did remember something
odd about yesterday.

16:35.640 --> 16:38.098
Apparently, Sam followed his
usual morning routine--

16:38.099 --> 16:40.083
he had a massage in the
hotel, then a meeting

16:40.084 --> 16:41.397
with his casino manager,

16:41.398 --> 16:43.316
then after lunch, he came
back with a bloody lip.

16:43.317 --> 16:44.129
How'd he get it?

16:44.130 --> 16:46.949
Well, Sam was evasive,
but his assistant said,

16:46.950 --> 16:48.031
it looked like someone hit him.

16:48.032 --> 16:50.077
So Sam gets punched, and soon after,

16:50.078 --> 16:51.279
he rushes off to New York,

16:51.280 --> 16:53.036
frantically trying to get that property.

16:54.099 --> 16:55.402
Then he's shot dead.

16:55.403 --> 16:56.937
Well, it's gotta be connected.

16:56.938 --> 16:58.635
The problem is, we don't
know who threw that punch.

17:00.230 --> 17:01.876
I think I know how we can find out.

17:06.212 --> 17:07.923
You said yesterday at 2:00 P.M.?

17:07.924 --> 17:09.239
Yeah, that's correct.

17:11.005 --> 17:12.875
It'll take a second for facial recognition

17:12.876 --> 17:14.792
to pick out Mr. Siegel in all the footage.

17:16.467 --> 17:18.724
Do you keep former guests in the system?

17:18.726 --> 17:21.798
Sure do. That's how we
flag gamblers with priors.

17:23.444 --> 17:27.089
What about me? Let's see.
Richard... Castle.

17:28.634 --> 17:30.548
Oh, resident, New York City...

17:30.549 --> 17:31.304
Mm-hmm.

17:31.305 --> 17:34.663
Disorderly conduct, resisting
arrest in 2003, and, uh,

17:35.760 --> 17:37.626
apparently last time you
were at the Sapphire,

17:37.627 --> 17:38.830
you accidentally

17:38.831 --> 17:40.484
set a mattress on fire,

17:40.485 --> 17:43.614
and the drapes were covered in jam.

17:45.472 --> 17:47.587
Yeah. That was a fun night.

17:48.010 --> 17:49.082
Check.

17:49.083 --> 17:49.973
Ah, here he is.

17:49.974 --> 17:51.248
That's Mr. Siegel,

17:51.249 --> 17:53.950
leaving the elevator at 2:00 P.M.

17:54.914 --> 17:57.692
He already has a bloody lip.
Can you back that up to earlier?

18:00.724 --> 18:01.745
Sir, am I interrupting?

18:01.746 --> 18:04.868
Just running background on the
tenants in the Queens building.

18:05.216 --> 18:07.788
I-I think I might know why
someone wanted Sam dead.

18:09.654 --> 18:11.934
According to his bank, Sam
wired over $10 million

18:11.935 --> 18:13.891
out of the Sapphire's
business account yesterday,

18:13.892 --> 18:15.455
wiping it clean.

18:15.456 --> 18:18.688
$10 million?
Wh-where did he transfer it to?

18:18.689 --> 18:20.966
To an offshore account in the Caymans.

18:24.699 --> 18:25.661
Beckett.

18:25.662 --> 18:27.919
So here he is, parting
ways with the pit boss

18:27.920 --> 18:29.183
at one of the tables.

18:31.480 --> 18:33.747
No bloody lip yet. Let it play, please.

18:40.814 --> 18:42.471
Is there another angle on that?

18:45.102 --> 18:46.900
That's Charlie Turner,
Sam's business partner.

18:46.901 --> 18:48.486
Why would Charlie attack Sam?

18:48.487 --> 18:49.597
I think I know.

18:49.997 --> 18:50.998
That was Beckett.

18:50.999 --> 18:53.067
Sam Siegel's been
embezzling from the casino.

18:53.498 --> 18:54.435
He's ripped 'em off for millions.

18:54.436 --> 18:56.401
Sounds like Sam was
trying to beat the house.

18:56.402 --> 18:58.447
And Charlie laid down the law.

19:03.207 --> 19:04.989
Something you forgot to tell us, Charlie?

19:05.723 --> 19:08.237
Business partners have disputes.

19:09.111 --> 19:10.245
Doesn't mean anything.

19:10.246 --> 19:11.381
What was it about?

19:12.161 --> 19:14.014
The thread count on the new sheets.

19:14.015 --> 19:17.047
Not the 10-plus million that
Sam stole from the casino?

19:17.509 --> 19:19.012
You knew he was embezzling.

19:19.013 --> 19:20.679
Okay, yeah, I knew. So?

19:20.680 --> 19:22.994
So it's 10 million motives for murder.

19:23.446 --> 19:24.341
You know, you may have noticed,

19:24.342 --> 19:26.320
we have a few cameras here at the casino.

19:26.802 --> 19:27.735
Take a look.

19:27.736 --> 19:30.516
I was here, not in New
York, killing my partner.

19:30.938 --> 19:31.883
Really?
Mm-hmm.

19:32.284 --> 19:35.125
'Cause that right hook kinda
looks like a warning to me.

19:37.322 --> 19:38.958
Yeah, you know, this town...

19:39.380 --> 19:41.326
If you're not careful,
it corrupts your soul.

19:42.552 --> 19:44.150
Sam and I were partners 20 years,

19:44.151 --> 19:46.229
and still, he thinks it's
okay to steal from me?

19:46.230 --> 19:48.525
When I saw he'd transferred
the $10 million out,

19:48.526 --> 19:50.452
I found him on the casino floor,

19:50.453 --> 19:52.078
and he denied even knowing about it.

19:52.079 --> 19:53.945
Can you believe it? So I punched him,

19:53.946 --> 19:55.412
and I told him, friend or no friend,

19:55.413 --> 19:57.037
he better have that money
back in my account,

19:57.038 --> 19:58.302
or he'd never walk again.

19:58.894 --> 20:00.083
So I must have scared him,

20:00.084 --> 20:02.367
because I get a call a few
hours later, and he said

20:02.648 --> 20:04.804
he'd have the money back
in my account today.

20:05.474 --> 20:06.549
And now it's today.

20:06.984 --> 20:09.018
And my friend is dead, and
the money's still gone.

20:11.192 --> 20:12.862
So the boys checked security footage,

20:12.863 --> 20:15.192
and they said that Charlie
was on the casino floor

20:15.193 --> 20:16.808
the whole night.

20:16.809 --> 20:18.013
He could've paid someone.

20:18.014 --> 20:20.390
Yeah, but why would he kill
Sam before he got his money?

20:20.391 --> 20:22.009
And if Sam actually stole something,

20:22.010 --> 20:23.885
why wasn't he on a plane to Barbados?

20:23.886 --> 20:26.239
Why was he wasting his time
coming up to New York?

20:26.240 --> 20:29.367
And how is all this connected
to the property in Queens?

20:29.368 --> 20:30.634
I think we're missing something.

20:30.635 --> 20:32.759
There's some piece of the
puzzle that'll help make

20:32.760 --> 20:35.655
all of Sam's seemingly
random actions make sense.

20:38.288 --> 20:39.096
Actually, that's something

20:39.097 --> 20:40.747
that Castle's pretty good at,

20:41.362 --> 20:42.483
taking a look at what we have

20:42.484 --> 20:44.664
and then helping to find that piece.

20:45.050 --> 20:46.407
Mr. Castle likes to throw

20:46.408 --> 20:48.712
a whole lot of crazy
theories against the wall.

20:48.961 --> 20:51.250
Real detectives don't have that luxury.

20:51.897 --> 20:54.061
It's our job to look at the facts.

20:54.273 --> 20:58.248
The bank report indicates that
Sam moved the money at 9:47 A.M.

20:58.249 --> 21:00.602
via electronic transfer on their web site.

21:00.624 --> 21:02.556
Now if we can find out who Sam talked to

21:02.557 --> 21:03.946
or met with right before that,

21:03.947 --> 21:06.079
we could maybe figure out what's going on.

21:06.080 --> 21:07.681
9:47?
Yes.

21:08.259 --> 21:10.451
Sam's assistant has him...

21:11.793 --> 21:12.886
At a massage.

21:13.961 --> 21:17.419
Yeah, Mr. Siegel had an hour
session yesterday at 9:00.

21:17.857 --> 21:18.493
Why?

21:18.494 --> 21:19.925
Well, we need to know if Sam made

21:19.926 --> 21:22.589
or received any phone calls
or perhaps any visitors

21:22.590 --> 21:23.566
during his session.

21:23.567 --> 21:26.111
No. He was very focused on the service.

21:26.112 --> 21:28.782
Amber, we know he went online at 9:47.

21:28.783 --> 21:29.992
We just need to know if he
made contact with anybody

21:29.993 --> 21:31.502
right before or right after.

21:31.503 --> 21:34.136
I told you, he wasn't on the
phone and he wasn't online.

21:34.137 --> 21:36.872
Well, what with mobile devices
being so small and slim,

21:36.873 --> 21:38.085
perhaps he had it in his hand.

21:38.086 --> 21:40.431
His hands were otherwise occupied.

21:47.478 --> 21:49.756
Oh. Oh. I get it.

21:50.496 --> 21:52.009
That--that kind of massage.

21:52.401 --> 21:55.375
So then Sam didn't make the transfer.

21:55.376 --> 21:57.360
He didn't steal the money.
Somebody stole it from him.

21:57.361 --> 21:59.977
Uh, Amber, we need to know if, um,

21:59.978 --> 22:01.186
perhaps there was anything, uh,

22:01.187 --> 22:03.766
maybe, unusual about the appointment.

22:03.767 --> 22:05.273
The only thing that seemed odd was that

22:05.274 --> 22:07.801
Nadine called that morning
to confirm the appointment.

22:07.802 --> 22:09.584
Nadine-- the personal concierge?

22:09.676 --> 22:11.112
Why was that unusual?

22:11.113 --> 22:13.560
Mr. Siegel's assistant usually
books the appointment.

22:13.587 --> 22:15.516
This was the first time Nadine ever called.

22:15.517 --> 22:16.151
Wait a minute.

22:16.152 --> 22:18.505
Did you say her name was Nadine Espinoza?

22:18.506 --> 22:20.221
Yeah, the concierge.
That name mean anything to you?

22:20.222 --> 22:22.082
Uh, Espinoza

22:22.083 --> 22:23.887
is the last name of one of the tenants

22:23.888 --> 22:26.309
in Sam's building in Queens-- uh...

22:26.703 --> 22:27.782
Teresa and Juan.

22:27.783 --> 22:29.942
They run the bodega on the ground floor,

22:29.943 --> 22:31.438
and they have a daughter named Nadine.

22:31.439 --> 22:32.604
That's our connection.

22:32.623 --> 22:34.020
Ryan, bring her in.

22:34.944 --> 22:35.844
Yes, sir.

22:36.528 --> 22:37.988
Nadine's supervisor said
she left her office

22:37.989 --> 22:40.367
ten minutes ago, claimed she
needed to go home sick.

22:40.437 --> 22:42.646
Well, there's a chance we can
catch her outside. Let's go.

22:46.888 --> 22:47.799
There she is.

22:51.561 --> 22:52.593
Oh, my God! Stop! Hey!

22:52.594 --> 22:54.226
No! No! Help!

22:54.539 --> 22:56.526
Hey! Hey!

22:58.271 --> 23:00.075
What the...

23:01.098 --> 23:03.561
We're not gonna be seeing
carrot top tonight, are we?

23:10.612 --> 23:12.483
Yeah, so, honey, it turns out

23:12.484 --> 23:15.602
I am going to be stuck here
for the rest of the night.

23:15.632 --> 23:16.829
Well, is everything all right?

23:16.830 --> 23:18.099
Yeah, yeah, just--

23:18.100 --> 23:21.150
the case just got a little complicated.

23:21.780 --> 23:23.138
But I want you to have a great time tonight

23:23.139 --> 23:24.162
with your girlfriends.

23:24.163 --> 23:26.239
I will, if you promise to be safe.

23:26.830 --> 23:27.732
Deal. Love you.

23:27.733 --> 23:28.698
Love you, too.

23:30.541 --> 23:32.350
Hey, Jules. Come on in.

23:32.658 --> 23:35.093
I've got my fave "get
over a breakup" snack,

23:35.107 --> 23:38.573
and a kick-ass chick flick--
"Bridesmaids," of course.

23:38.574 --> 23:40.846
Okay. Uh, the girls are on their way,

23:40.847 --> 23:42.677
and it turns out, my dad's out of town,

23:42.678 --> 23:44.528
so we have the whole place to ourselves.

23:44.529 --> 23:46.045
Cool.

23:46.652 --> 23:49.084
By the way, Mena said her
boyfriend might swing by

23:49.085 --> 23:50.645
and drop of her jacket.

23:51.151 --> 23:53.108
Isn't he friends with Brian from homeroom?

23:53.109 --> 23:55.038
Hot-as-hell Brian?
Yeah.

23:55.410 --> 23:57.664
I think they're doing a
bros' night at the movies.

23:57.820 --> 23:59.902
Well, maybe we could invite them over, too,

23:59.903 --> 24:01.237
all watch a movie here.

24:01.238 --> 24:02.938
Brian?
Yeah.

24:03.139 --> 24:04.776
He's, like, a total jock.

24:05.052 --> 24:07.137
Completely the opposite of your type.

24:07.138 --> 24:07.734
I know.

24:07.735 --> 24:10.324
He's so... not Ashley.

24:11.676 --> 24:13.126
I'll text Mena.

24:16.685 --> 24:19.244
So Beckett says the plates
on the S.U.V. came back as stolen.

24:19.628 --> 24:21.348
Most likely the same S.U.V.
that was spotted

24:21.349 --> 24:23.850
coming out of that abandoned
warehouse where Sam was killed.

24:24.128 --> 24:25.901
If it's the same car, why
would they want Nadine?

24:25.902 --> 24:28.431
Because whatever this is,
Nadine is knee-deep in it.

24:28.432 --> 24:29.562
Try neck-deep.

24:29.828 --> 24:33.029
A.C.P.D. let me check in to that
laptop in Nadine's work bag.

24:33.030 --> 24:34.455
I checked her browser history.

24:34.456 --> 24:36.605
Guess who paid a visit to the
New Reserve Bank web site

24:36.606 --> 24:38.670
yesterday at 9:47 A.M.?

24:39.681 --> 24:40.679
Nadine's our thief?

24:40.680 --> 24:43.591
Yep, our concierge pulled quite a score.

24:43.795 --> 24:45.182
She logged in with Sam's
account information

24:45.183 --> 24:46.758
and transferred the 10 mil.

24:47.032 --> 24:49.442
So whoever took her is after the money.

24:49.930 --> 24:51.991
They tried to get it from Sam.
When that didn't work,

24:51.992 --> 24:54.104
they killed him, and now
they've gone for Nadine.

24:54.105 --> 24:56.248
Okay, but we still don't
know who "they" are.

24:56.490 --> 24:58.469
There's only one person
who makes any sense.

24:59.391 --> 25:00.954
The guy whose money it is.

25:01.680 --> 25:03.796
Why would I kidnap my own concierge?

25:04.072 --> 25:06.309
Because you found out she was
the one who stole your money.

25:06.466 --> 25:07.785
Nadine stole my money?

25:07.786 --> 25:10.297
You can stop the theatrics.
We know you know.

25:10.766 --> 25:11.836
Mr. Turner,

25:11.837 --> 25:14.368
your casino maintains a
fleet of black S.U.V.s

25:14.369 --> 25:16.048
to shuttle around your high-rollers.

25:16.654 --> 25:18.743
All the casinos do.
That doesn't prove anything.

25:18.744 --> 25:21.073
Well, then you won't
mind if we inspect them.

25:21.081 --> 25:22.923
Just to make sure they're
all accounted for.

25:23.063 --> 25:24.168
We're done here.

25:24.480 --> 25:25.428
Excuse me?

25:25.429 --> 25:27.360
You people are here from another state.

25:27.540 --> 25:29.388
You have no jurisdiction
and you have no warrant,

25:29.389 --> 25:31.682
and I believe I've tolerated
your presence long enough.

25:31.683 --> 25:33.337
Get out of my casino.

25:33.513 --> 25:34.337
Are you kidding?

25:34.338 --> 25:35.880
Do I look like I'm kidding?

25:36.119 --> 25:37.550
I want you to leave. Now.

25:37.917 --> 25:39.036
Can he do that?

25:41.762 --> 25:43.886
What? How did you guys get kicked out?

25:43.887 --> 25:44.892
Turns out Charlie's version

25:44.893 --> 25:47.222
of full cooperation isn't all that full.

25:47.223 --> 25:48.280
The only reason he kicked us out

25:48.281 --> 25:50.066
is because he's behind the whole thing.

25:50.067 --> 25:52.625
Yeah, but kidnap somebody
right in front of his casino?

25:52.626 --> 25:53.882
That's a bit bold.

25:53.940 --> 25:55.748
If he knew it was her, why would he wait?

25:55.886 --> 25:57.005
Why didn't he just grab her in the casino

25:57.006 --> 25:58.341
while she was on shift?

25:58.349 --> 26:01.337
Yeah, I mean, he did
seem genuinely surprised

26:01.338 --> 26:02.501
when we told him it was Nadine.

26:02.502 --> 26:03.784
Maybe he didn't know.

26:03.785 --> 26:05.485
Yeah, but he's the only one with motive.

26:05.486 --> 26:06.255
Well, not necessarily.

26:06.256 --> 26:08.156
What if someone else knew what Nadine did

26:08.157 --> 26:09.272
and wanted the money?

26:09.476 --> 26:10.763
How would they find out?

26:11.318 --> 26:12.479
Maybe Nadine told 'em.

26:12.675 --> 26:14.664
I mean, that would explain
the phone records.

26:14.665 --> 26:15.715
How so?

26:15.716 --> 26:17.491
Listen, I pulled her phone history.

26:17.492 --> 26:20.131
She called a number inside the
casino immediately before

26:20.132 --> 26:22.575
and after making that transfer at 9:47.

26:22.576 --> 26:25.956
I tracked down the extension
to a-a Daniel Sullivan.

26:26.944 --> 26:28.821
Daniel? That's Charlie's security guy.

26:28.822 --> 26:29.622
That would explain

26:29.623 --> 26:31.473
how Nadine got ahold of Sam's passwords.

26:31.474 --> 26:32.717
Daniel is her partner.

26:32.718 --> 26:34.560
He's got eyes and ears
all over that casino.

26:34.561 --> 26:35.401
All right. See what he knows.

26:35.402 --> 26:36.313
We can't.

26:36.481 --> 26:37.771
He's inside the casino,

26:37.772 --> 26:39.828
and their security won't let us back in.

26:41.468 --> 26:43.266
Okay, sit tight. I'm driving down.

26:43.366 --> 26:44.632
No. No, no.
Beckett, you don't have to do that.

26:44.640 --> 26:46.134
No, no, we got-- we
really have-- we got it.

26:46.386 --> 26:47.495
Yeah, she's gone.

26:50.050 --> 26:51.690
So I told coach, if I'm open on the 3,

26:51.691 --> 26:53.286
the point guard better feed me.

26:53.415 --> 26:54.946
That's really interesting.

26:55.054 --> 26:57.499
But did you have to invite
half the team over?

26:58.303 --> 26:59.685
I like your hair. It's...

27:00.542 --> 27:01.506
Red.

27:07.261 --> 27:09.256
Will you excuse me for a sec?

27:10.414 --> 27:11.760
Hey, I need to talk to you.

27:11.761 --> 27:13.274
Can it wait a second?
I think someone just broke the blender.

27:13.275 --> 27:14.112
Who are all these people?

27:14.113 --> 27:16.202
Jamie Cruz just posted
an update on Facebook

27:16.203 --> 27:17.037
that you're having a party.

27:17.038 --> 27:19.629
What? He's kind of a loser, though,

27:19.630 --> 27:21.545
so I'm--I'm sure he doesn't
have that many friends.

27:21.546 --> 27:23.458
Yeah. I mean, how many people
are just sitting at home

27:23.459 --> 27:24.976
waiting to hear about a party?

27:35.357 --> 27:38.821
This is the worst impromptu
bachelor party while on case ever.

27:38.822 --> 27:40.239
This is humiliating.

27:40.310 --> 27:42.362
We're homicide detectives with the NYPD.

27:42.363 --> 27:43.954
Unfortunately, we're in New Jersey.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.204
At least we're not on a ticking clock

27:45.205 --> 27:46.251
because a woman's been kidnapped.

27:46.252 --> 27:48.178
Oh, wait. We are.

27:48.429 --> 27:50.353
There's gotta be some
other way we can get in.

27:57.770 --> 28:00.005
What if I told you, I could
get us back in the hotel,

28:00.006 --> 28:01.740
past security, all...

28:02.067 --> 28:04.114
While circumventing facial recognition?

28:04.226 --> 28:05.582
How the hell are you gonna do that?

28:37.077 --> 28:39.055
Thank you. Thank you very much.

28:40.687 --> 28:42.705
How do you know she wasn't
talking to me? Well--

28:42.706 --> 28:44.966
What, Elvis can't be brown?

28:45.469 --> 28:46.670
I'm Elvez.

28:49.337 --> 28:51.100
Hey. How you doin'?

29:10.754 --> 29:11.893
What the hell?

29:11.953 --> 29:13.441
We'd like a word about Nadine.

29:14.584 --> 29:15.857
You're joking, right?

29:16.152 --> 29:17.800
Does it look like we're joking?

29:22.474 --> 29:25.506
Okay. Why are you guys dressed like that?

29:25.704 --> 29:27.153
A better question is,

29:27.154 --> 29:31.039
why did Nadine call you at 9:48 yesterday?

29:32.184 --> 29:33.467
You know about that?

29:33.902 --> 29:35.637
We know you two were partners.

29:36.206 --> 29:37.153
Who took her?

29:37.154 --> 29:38.622
Who was in the S.U.V.?

29:40.349 --> 29:41.189
I don't know.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.639
I... this wasn't supposed to happen.

29:43.640 --> 29:46.515
Are you guys saying that
you accidentally stole

29:46.638 --> 29:47.681
$10 million

29:47.682 --> 29:48.926
from Charlie and Sam?

29:49.369 --> 29:51.055
No, we didn't steal it.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.776
We were--we were using it as leverage.

29:53.777 --> 29:55.110
To get Sam to hand over

29:55.111 --> 29:57.596
that building in Queens for her parents.

29:57.597 --> 29:59.900
Yeah, but it-- it's not why you think.

30:01.268 --> 30:04.320
Nadine and I started
dating a few months ago.

30:05.521 --> 30:06.756
We're in love.

30:07.253 --> 30:09.557
We wanted to start over, move somewhere,

30:09.558 --> 30:11.059
but Sam wouldn't let her go.

30:11.060 --> 30:12.101
They were an item?

30:12.102 --> 30:13.689
No, only in his mind.

30:13.974 --> 30:17.685
She refused all of his advances,
but he wouldn't stop.

30:18.003 --> 30:19.247
Why didn't she report him?

30:19.248 --> 30:20.690
Because this was his casino.

30:20.691 --> 30:22.661
Nobody would've taken her seriously.

30:22.662 --> 30:24.442
She tried to quit about a year ago.

30:24.443 --> 30:26.679
That's when he bought her parents' building

30:26.680 --> 30:30.393
and threatened to evict 'em
if she didn't sleep with him.

30:30.407 --> 30:32.096
I had to do something to stop him.

30:32.097 --> 30:34.391
So you came up with a plan
to hold the money hostage

30:34.392 --> 30:35.835
until he turned over the deed?

30:35.836 --> 30:38.211
He was gonna sign it over as a quitclaim,

30:38.223 --> 30:40.513
and then I was gonna
transfer the money back.

30:40.727 --> 30:42.437
And then Nadine would be free.

30:42.781 --> 30:44.907
None of this explains who killed Sam.

30:47.477 --> 30:51.179
Something about the money made Sam panic.

30:51.276 --> 30:52.346
What do you mean?

30:52.347 --> 30:55.595
When I called Sam to give him
instructions about the deed,

30:56.115 --> 30:58.765
he told me, I stole the
wrong person's money.

31:00.420 --> 31:00.928
And he told me,

31:00.929 --> 31:04.141
when they found out, we'd all be dead.

31:05.363 --> 31:07.018
Who was he talking about?

31:07.263 --> 31:08.408
I don't know.

31:10.796 --> 31:12.139
Oh, hey, guys.

31:12.140 --> 31:13.966
Uh, we were just leaving.

31:13.967 --> 31:15.892
This isn't the ballroom. Huh.

31:21.057 --> 31:22.821
Let me guess. Facebook?

31:22.965 --> 31:25.007
Twitter. You might want to just
leave this open, by the way.

31:25.008 --> 31:26.284
There's, like, a whole bunch of people

31:26.285 --> 31:28.613
lining up for the elevator downstairs.

31:49.073 --> 31:50.911
Julie, this is a disaster.

31:51.268 --> 31:53.127
Chill. It's just a party.

31:53.285 --> 31:54.393
Have some fun for once.

31:54.394 --> 31:56.399
Fun? I don't even know half these people.

31:56.400 --> 31:57.940
Oh, what about, um...

31:58.902 --> 32:00.388
Uh, Brian?

32:00.572 --> 32:02.723
He has the I.Q. of a squirrel.

32:05.752 --> 32:08.044
Oh, God. My dad's gonna kill me.

32:08.388 --> 32:10.914
Please. You have the coolest dad ever.

32:10.967 --> 32:13.630
If he were to walk in right
now, I bet he wouldn't care.

32:14.257 --> 32:16.437
You're right. He probably wouldn't care.

32:17.138 --> 32:18.571
The problem is, I do.

32:25.056 --> 32:26.930
Everybody, listen up.

32:27.312 --> 32:29.063
The party is over.

32:29.440 --> 32:31.349
Thanks for coming, thanks for spilling,

32:31.350 --> 32:34.087
thanks for telling every
teenager with a pulse.

32:34.088 --> 32:35.874
Now, everybody, out.

32:35.875 --> 32:38.273
Oh, really? Really?

32:38.706 --> 32:40.603
If it wasn't illegal, I'd kick your ass.

32:41.232 --> 32:42.734
Wonder where they took Castle.

32:51.455 --> 32:52.817
You were told what would happen

32:52.818 --> 32:54.876
if you came back here.

32:55.230 --> 32:57.344
Now I'm not stupid enough to beat on cops,

32:57.345 --> 32:59.832
but you, on the other hand,
are a different story.

33:00.152 --> 33:01.501
I want my money, Mr. Castle,

33:01.502 --> 33:03.890
so you better tell me everything you know.

33:05.366 --> 33:06.768
I know it's not your money.

33:11.503 --> 33:12.910
Would you excuse us?

33:26.680 --> 33:27.925
Who told you?

33:29.522 --> 33:30.820
No one told me.

33:31.245 --> 33:32.424
I put the pieces together.

33:32.425 --> 33:33.969
Sam's murder, Nadine's kidnapping,

33:33.970 --> 33:35.985
none of it makes any sense
if it was your money.

33:35.986 --> 33:37.340
You know what I think?

33:38.369 --> 33:39.974
I think the money Nadine stole from you

33:39.975 --> 33:41.669
actually belonged to someone else.

33:41.670 --> 33:43.949
Otherwise, you wouldn't be so desperate.

33:43.950 --> 33:45.858
So tell me, Charlie, what happened,

33:45.859 --> 33:47.539
you and Sam take out a
loan from an institution

33:47.540 --> 33:49.787
that doesn't offer flexible payment plans?

33:49.788 --> 33:50.833
You borrowed money from the mob.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.278
That's why you didn't want
us sniffing around here.

33:52.279 --> 33:56.095
What I can't figure out is,
how could you be so stupid?

33:56.151 --> 33:57.722
The banks weren't lending.

33:58.093 --> 34:01.338
We needed a cash infusion, or
else we would've had to fold.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.830
And now the money's gone.

34:04.102 --> 34:06.988
You have any idea how bad it is

34:06.989 --> 34:09.351
to default on a loan from the mob?

34:09.827 --> 34:11.716
How'd they find out about Nadine?

34:11.717 --> 34:12.996
Hell if I know.

34:13.733 --> 34:15.210
Maybe Sam told 'em.

34:15.693 --> 34:16.926
All I know...

34:17.489 --> 34:19.391
Is that I need my money back.

34:20.226 --> 34:21.839
I can get your money back for you.

34:22.784 --> 34:24.884
But I need you to do something for me.

34:26.610 --> 34:27.748
Who are they?

34:28.985 --> 34:30.396
No. No way.

34:30.397 --> 34:31.914
Come on, Charlie.

34:32.013 --> 34:33.054
They killed Sam.

34:33.056 --> 34:35.438
And unless they get their money
back, they're gonna kill Nadine

34:35.438 --> 34:36.708
and then you.

34:36.708 --> 34:38.246
Those are your cards.

34:38.436 --> 34:40.166
Is this really how you're gonna play 'em?

34:47.478 --> 34:49.757
Um... funny story?

34:49.759 --> 34:51.855
We, uh, look, this is...

34:51.870 --> 34:52.659
We can explain.

34:52.661 --> 34:54.743
No, I'm not even sure I want to know.

34:54.744 --> 34:56.206
It was Castle's idea.

34:56.208 --> 34:57.595
And it worked.

34:58.074 --> 34:59.546
I know who killed Sam.

34:59.629 --> 35:00.673
Who?

35:02.109 --> 35:03.420
Tommy Moretti.

35:03.421 --> 35:06.353
He made a hard-money loan to
the Sapphire six months ago,

35:06.354 --> 35:07.850
and it's due.

35:07.851 --> 35:09.501
It was his money that Nadine stole.

35:09.502 --> 35:11.569
Felony assault, attempted
murder, racketeering--

35:11.570 --> 35:14.343
the feds have been trying
to get him for years.

35:14.351 --> 35:15.763
He was at the bar earlier today.

35:15.764 --> 35:18.113
He told Charlie he needed
his luck to change.

35:18.114 --> 35:19.934
Probably a veiled threat.

35:20.161 --> 35:21.303
What if he kills her?

35:21.304 --> 35:22.783
Nah, he wants his money too much.

35:22.784 --> 35:24.265
Just stick to the plan.

35:24.266 --> 35:26.412
Charlie called Moretti, told
him to meet him at the casino,

35:26.413 --> 35:28.375
first thing in the morning
when the banks open.

35:28.376 --> 35:29.837
Once you turn over the $10 million,

35:29.838 --> 35:30.800
he'll turn over Nadine.

35:30.801 --> 35:32.650
And then we'll arrest him for Sam's murder.

35:32.651 --> 35:34.042
And what if he smells a trap?

35:34.043 --> 35:36.142
He won't. We'll be ready.

35:43.203 --> 35:44.347
Here he comes.

35:44.570 --> 35:45.632
Tommy Moretti.

35:45.633 --> 35:47.411
The guy is a sociopath.

35:49.074 --> 35:51.267
The problem is, with half
the city on his payroll,

35:51.268 --> 35:52.703
no one can touch him.

35:53.453 --> 35:56.283
You got some pretty big balls,
kid, to steal from me.

35:56.579 --> 35:57.912
Look, I-I'm sorry, Mr. Moretti.

35:57.913 --> 35:59.996
I had no idea you were involved.

36:01.256 --> 36:03.053
I'll log on and transfer the funds

36:03.054 --> 36:04.521
as soon as I see Nadine.

36:04.522 --> 36:05.869
You got a lot of demands for a kid

36:05.870 --> 36:08.622
who's lucky to be sucking
down air right now.

36:40.717 --> 36:42.110
You said you'd let her go.

37:06.251 --> 37:08.494
Okay, here's where it gets interesting.

37:10.417 --> 37:12.840
Funny. Somehow I figured I wasn't done.

37:12.983 --> 37:13.987
Take a seat, Mr. Moretti.

37:13.988 --> 37:16.697
We got a few questions
about Sam Siegel's murder.

37:20.275 --> 37:22.494
You got me in a cooperative
mood, detective.

37:22.495 --> 37:25.018
Now that I got my money back,
what can I do for you?

37:25.019 --> 37:26.027
The night of Sam's murder,

37:26.028 --> 37:29.328
you charged a meal at Carmine's.

37:29.759 --> 37:32.726
That's about a mile away
from the crime scene.

37:32.828 --> 37:35.070
That's a long way to go
for good chicken parm.

37:36.064 --> 37:37.451
I had a craving.

37:37.452 --> 37:38.050
For good Italian

37:38.051 --> 37:40.966
or for the $10 million Sam stole from you?

37:41.133 --> 37:42.480
Come on. If I had killed Sam,

37:42.481 --> 37:44.567
you think you would've ever found the body?

37:44.746 --> 37:46.734
The guy you're looking for ain't me.

37:47.186 --> 37:48.562
But you were there.

37:50.318 --> 37:51.685
Sam called me.

37:51.686 --> 37:54.319
He said he was having
trouble repaying the loan.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.120
So I arranged a meeting.

37:56.121 --> 37:57.342
Yeah, at just the kind of place

37:57.343 --> 38:00.213
guys like you like to put
bullets into guys like him.

38:00.214 --> 38:02.036
You can't get money from a dead guy.

38:02.037 --> 38:04.856
I'd have broken his legs and
taken his casino first.

38:05.293 --> 38:07.412
Now see, I knew all about the blackmail.

38:07.413 --> 38:08.600
Sam told me.

38:08.601 --> 38:10.003
He said I had nothing to worry about

38:10.004 --> 38:14.100
because his ex-wife had signed
over the property in Queens.

38:14.155 --> 38:17.325
The blackmailers were
transferring the 10 mil back.

38:17.338 --> 38:19.063
He was gonna drop off the
money in the morning,

38:19.064 --> 38:20.058
so...

38:20.597 --> 38:22.636
I gave him an extra 24 hours.

38:22.970 --> 38:24.321
It was the last I saw of him.

38:24.322 --> 38:25.912
Except Sam lied.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.781
His ex-wife never signed.

38:27.914 --> 38:29.204
Yeah, she did.

38:30.342 --> 38:32.115
He showed me the signature himself.

38:32.116 --> 38:34.483
That's the reason I gave
him the extra time.

38:39.485 --> 38:40.711
I didn't lie.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.349
So then what happened to the paperwork

38:42.350 --> 38:44.462
after Sam left your apartment?

38:44.463 --> 38:45.706
He took it with him.

38:46.858 --> 38:47.899
That's odd.

38:48.293 --> 38:51.336
I would've thought I would've
found it on his body.

38:52.087 --> 38:53.290
But we didn't.

38:54.773 --> 38:56.578
It made me wonder where it was.

38:57.580 --> 38:59.801
Maybe the person who killed him took it.

39:00.218 --> 39:01.821
Yeah, maybe she did.

39:06.930 --> 39:09.217
So uniforms found this

39:09.218 --> 39:10.626
in your apartment's trash bin.

39:10.627 --> 39:12.913
It has your signature on it.

39:15.473 --> 39:16.723
You did lie.

39:18.076 --> 39:19.500
He pleaded with me...

39:20.280 --> 39:21.066
Begged me

39:21.067 --> 39:22.505
to sign that form.

39:23.276 --> 39:24.704
And when I said no,

39:25.840 --> 39:28.572
he took out his gun, put it in my mouth,

39:28.573 --> 39:30.294
and told me, if I didn't sign the form,

39:30.295 --> 39:33.114
he would paint the walls with my brains.

39:33.744 --> 39:35.328
The only reason I was
able to get that divorce

39:35.329 --> 39:37.903
was because he said I had gotten old,

39:38.537 --> 39:39.961
that he was done with me.

39:40.449 --> 39:42.130
And I was grateful,

39:42.328 --> 39:44.215
grateful for a way out.

39:45.328 --> 39:47.048
But with a man like Sam...

39:48.680 --> 39:50.242
You're never really out.

39:51.521 --> 39:52.936
So when he told me

39:52.937 --> 39:55.037
that someone wanted him dead,

39:55.915 --> 39:58.097
I thought, here's my chance.

39:59.686 --> 40:01.102
So then what happened?

40:02.014 --> 40:04.456
He made a call from my
phone about the meet.

40:05.282 --> 40:06.580
After he left,

40:07.424 --> 40:08.503
I took out the .38

40:08.504 --> 40:10.884
that he gave me for our second anniversary,

40:11.925 --> 40:13.721
went out the service exit.

40:15.585 --> 40:18.684
And I hunted him down like
the vicious animal he was.

40:25.015 --> 40:25.575
I've asked the D.A.

40:25.576 --> 40:28.193
to look into the mitigating circumstances.

40:28.459 --> 40:29.537
They'll take her situation

40:29.538 --> 40:31.925
into account when they offer her a plea.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.089
Thank you for your help on this one.

40:34.207 --> 40:38.209
I enjoy checking out the
view from the trenches

40:38.210 --> 40:39.442
once in a while.

40:39.583 --> 40:42.196
Yeah, well, it helps to be
surrounded by a good team.

40:44.693 --> 40:46.063
You mean Castle.

40:46.744 --> 40:48.231
You said it, not me.

40:48.419 --> 40:49.317
He's not a cop.

40:49.318 --> 40:51.323
Yeah, but that's what makes him so good.

40:52.022 --> 40:53.233
Well, speaking of which,

40:53.234 --> 40:54.819
uh, where are they?

40:55.367 --> 40:57.155
I gave them the afternoon off.

40:57.326 --> 40:59.936
Apparently, Ryan got stuck
with an underage best man,

40:59.937 --> 41:03.277
so the boys are giving him
the unofficial bachelor party.

41:03.816 --> 41:04.524
I trust you'll edit

41:04.525 --> 41:07.860
their side of the
investigation in the report.

41:42.683 --> 41:43.653
Hey.

41:45.488 --> 41:46.737
What happened to you?

41:48.687 --> 41:49.764
Nothing.

41:50.263 --> 41:52.421
Nothing. What-- what happened here?

41:52.911 --> 41:54.001
Nothing.

41:55.279 --> 41:56.573
Where's the, um...

41:57.858 --> 41:59.315
Where's the little silver dog statue

41:59.316 --> 42:01.171
that's usually on the back of the couch?

42:01.274 --> 42:02.916
Oh, I think gram said she needed it

42:02.917 --> 42:04.891
for set dressing for her play.

42:07.583 --> 42:17.686
