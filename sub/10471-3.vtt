00:27.560 --> 00:29.036
Morning!

00:31.920 --> 00:33.960
Hello, Nurse Lee.
Morning!

00:44.320 --> 00:47.879
Before I came to
Poplar, I'd been sheltered.

00:47.880 --> 00:52.679
I was shy, shielded
from life's more... unsavoury facts.

00:52.680 --> 00:55.999
I'd kept my guard up,
kept my head down,

00:56.000 --> 01:00.519
kept my distance from the world
and believed myself content.

01:00.520 --> 01:02.599
What? Getting a good look, are you?

01:02.600 --> 01:05.680
Be nice. You might well
be seeing a lot more of me.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.200
Life in the East End
had begun to make its mark.

01:12.280 --> 01:14.839
I was growing bolder.

01:14.840 --> 01:18.960
But there was still a great deal
I was keeping in reserve.

01:23.920 --> 01:26.519
Another early one?
Aren't they always?

01:26.520 --> 01:29.759
Sometimes you want to tell them
to cross their legs till lunch time.

01:29.760 --> 01:33.239
A happy customer donated
half a cow to our dinner table.

01:33.240 --> 01:35.919
Must have been quite a delivery.

01:35.920 --> 01:36.998
Butcher's baby.

01:36.999 --> 01:39.080
It's not fireworks, is it, Fred?

01:39.081 --> 01:40.119
Nope.

01:40.120 --> 01:41.679
Well, that's something at least.

01:41.680 --> 01:44.879
Fred has another moneyspinning idea
and won't tell us what it is.

01:44.880 --> 01:47.639
You're welcome to guess,
but you won't get it.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.639
It's a winner, this one,
I'm telling you.

01:49.640 --> 01:51.879
Fortes fortuna adiuvat.

01:51.880 --> 01:54.279
Fortune favours the bold.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.743
Thus Virgil.

01:55.785 --> 01:57.224
Quite right, Sister.

01:57.243 --> 02:01.850
Caput inter nubilia condo.
I hide my head among the clouds.

02:01.968 --> 02:03.367
Also Virgil.

02:03.423 --> 02:05.702
It's too early for Virgil.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.549
Only for the ignorant.

02:07.800 --> 02:09.799
Nurse Lee, excellent.

02:09.800 --> 02:11.720
I'm sure you wanted a
rest after the night

02:11.721 --> 02:13.639
you've had, but I'm
afraid you're needed.

02:13.640 --> 02:17.839
This is the one, ladies.
I can feel it.

02:17.840 --> 02:22.759
"Who's got that big house on the hill?
" people will ask, and it'll be me.

02:22.760 --> 02:24.556
You see if it ain't.

02:24.600 --> 02:28.960
And everyone will say,
"He's not such a fool as we thought."

02:34.600 --> 02:37.359
The patient is Joe Collett.

02:37.360 --> 02:39.999
He suffers with ulcers on his legs

02:40.000 --> 02:43.126
and requires his dressings
to be changed three times a week.

02:43.148 --> 02:44.187
Ulcers?

02:44.360 --> 02:48.159
I know you weren't on the district
nursing rota for several weeks,

02:48.160 --> 02:51.559
but numbers at Nonnatus are limited,

02:51.560 --> 02:55.079
and the needs of our community
are only ever expanding, so...

02:55.080 --> 02:57.159
Of course.

02:57.160 --> 02:58.919
Enjoy yourself.

02:58.920 --> 03:01.800
He is an interesting old man,
I have found.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.040
Hurry up.

03:11.200 --> 03:13.599
Sorry, it's my blasted slip.

03:13.600 --> 03:15.680
I took it in last night,
but I think I've overdone it.

03:15.681 --> 03:18.039
It's somewhat restrictive
to the breathing.

03:18.040 --> 03:21.119
Planning to work in that?
I'm fine.

03:21.120 --> 03:22.999
Unless I bend. Or sit.

03:23.000 --> 03:25.199
Or laugh. Or cough. Or if I...

03:29.120 --> 03:30.360
Morning, officers.

03:30.361 --> 03:33.079
Good morning, Sister.

03:33.080 --> 03:36.639
I am so, so sorry.
No harm done.

03:36.640 --> 03:38.719
You're something of a menace
on that thing.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.719
I know.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.719
Constable Noakes is the...

03:42.720 --> 03:45.519
the officer I managed to crash into
a few weeks ago.

03:45.520 --> 03:48.959
If it's any consolation, she's a menace
no matter how she conveys herself.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.799
Well, like I say,
no harm done at all.

03:51.800 --> 03:53.959
Although maybe it'd be best
if you had hit me.

03:53.960 --> 03:57.239
I wouldn't say no to more
of that whiskey you brought over.

03:57.240 --> 03:59.439
I'm sure it can be arranged.
The whiskey,

03:59.440 --> 04:01.760
not deliberately levelling you
with my bicycle.

04:04.480 --> 04:06.079
You look well.
And you.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.439
Very well.

04:08.440 --> 04:10.159
As do you.

04:10.160 --> 04:13.239
Well...

04:13.240 --> 04:14.959
I'd best be getting on.

04:14.960 --> 04:17.959
Uphold the law, good sir.

04:17.959 --> 04:19.839
Quite.

04:22.480 --> 04:25.559
Chummy...! Why on earth
did I say that?

04:25.560 --> 04:28.199
At times like this, I'm more
grateful than ever that I took vows.

04:28.200 --> 04:30.039
Now come along.

04:49.560 --> 04:54.279
Mr Collett, I'm Nurse Jenny Lee.
I'm here to see about your ulcers.

04:54.280 --> 04:59.079
Yeah, well,
it's my pleasure to have you here.

04:59.080 --> 05:02.439
I'm sure we're going to get along
famous.

05:02.440 --> 05:03.960
Follow me.

05:06.240 --> 05:09.440
I've...
I've got the boiling water ready.

05:23.200 --> 05:27.279
Where can I lay out
my instruments?

05:27.280 --> 05:30.240
Just move that out the way.

05:40.400 --> 05:42.800
I'm going to clean the wounds now.
It may sting, Mr Collett.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.880
Joe. Joe will do fine. Yeah.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.959
Would you... would you like
a cup of tea?

05:53.960 --> 05:57.039
I'm fine, thank you.
It's no bother.

05:57.040 --> 05:59.639
It won't take but a minute.

05:59.640 --> 06:01.840
There.

06:06.000 --> 06:09.360
What... what's wrong?

06:11.040 --> 06:15.359
I'd actually... prefer a cold
drink, if you had one.

06:15.360 --> 06:20.759
Then that's what you shall have,
my maiden.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.879
No, I can't drink on duty.
I meant orange squash or something.

06:27.440 --> 06:32.000
Well, I'm sorry.
I... I don't have anything else.

06:37.160 --> 06:39.040
It doesn't matter.

06:40.680 --> 06:44.759
I got them from gun wounds
during the war.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.439
The Boer War, this was.

06:46.440 --> 06:48.519
I thought you must be a soldier.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.879
A soldier!

06:50.880 --> 06:52.599
Hardly.

06:52.600 --> 06:54.560
I was 17.

06:55.520 --> 06:56.800
No older than you.

06:56.801 --> 06:59.519
You're flattering me, Mr Collett.
Yes.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.559
I... I am. Is it working?

07:02.560 --> 07:05.119
Absolutely!

07:05.120 --> 07:06.479
Over here.

07:06.480 --> 07:09.039
Beautiful bunch?

07:09.040 --> 07:11.519
Lovely. Yeah.

07:11.520 --> 07:16.239
My two sons, they...
joined the Great War and...

07:16.240 --> 07:18.360
they never came home.

07:19.800 --> 07:22.800
And my Sally... Yeah.

07:24.040 --> 07:26.480
A firebomb during the Blitz.

07:30.560 --> 07:32.360
I'm sorry. Don't be.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.199
I loved them.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.359
They loved me.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.919
There. All done.

07:42.920 --> 07:46.319
Now, are you sure
I can't offer you a drink?

07:46.320 --> 07:48.559
I'm quite all right, really.

07:48.560 --> 07:51.359
Yes, of course...

07:51.360 --> 07:54.840
you have a great deal to do,
no doubt.

07:59.080 --> 08:01.599
I have the evening off tonight.

08:01.600 --> 08:05.120
I could... come back then
and share a glass with you?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.799
If... if you wanted that, I mean.

08:08.800 --> 08:13.399
Well, that would be a delight,
my maiden.

08:13.400 --> 08:16.400
A thousand welcomes.

08:51.320 --> 08:53.079
Pregnant?

08:53.080 --> 08:55.599
We're having a baby, you know.
Me and my wife.

08:55.600 --> 08:58.399
Just found out today.

08:58.400 --> 09:00.439
I'm going to be a dad.

09:00.440 --> 09:02.719
Hush, Ted.
Sorry, love.

09:02.720 --> 09:05.639
Got no chance now, have I?

09:05.640 --> 09:07.719
Not now it's two against one.

09:07.720 --> 09:09.919
Mrs Lawson?

09:09.920 --> 09:12.199
That's us. Ted and Winnie.

09:12.200 --> 09:15.239
I'm sorry.
We don't allow men back here.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.079
I can't stay with her?

09:17.080 --> 09:19.079
I'm sorry, Mr Lawson.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.440
I'll be right here, love,
if you need me. Right here.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.400
We went to the doctor's
this morning.

09:24.401 --> 09:27.719
I thought Win was ill, didn't I?

09:27.720 --> 09:30.160
Lost my first wife to cancer,
so I was thinking the worst.

09:30.161 --> 09:33.199
She's been so tired.

09:33.200 --> 09:35.600
And there it is. Pregnant.

09:37.400 --> 09:41.199
Thought I was too old.
I've got three already.

09:41.200 --> 09:43.440
Done most of their growing.

09:45.520 --> 09:48.319
I never even thought about another.

09:48.320 --> 09:49.440
There.

09:55.280 --> 09:57.999
36 centimetres fundal height.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.240
That means you're 36 weeks along.
Due in a month.

10:02.680 --> 10:04.679
That soon?

10:04.680 --> 10:06.719
Your husband said
you only found out today?

10:06.720 --> 10:09.359
I... I knew I was getting bigger.

10:09.360 --> 10:13.040
So did Ted, though, bless him,
he never said nothing.

10:14.400 --> 10:19.000
I thought maybe I was going through
the change or... I don't know.

10:20.840 --> 10:24.559
Maybe I just didn't want to think
I could be in the family way again.

10:24.560 --> 10:26.200
Not now.

10:27.640 --> 10:30.920
Mrs Lawson, are you all right?
Course.

10:31.920 --> 10:33.759
Just a bit of a shock.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.759
I'm 41. I'm too old.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.000
All that all over again.

10:40.760 --> 10:42.760
It's just a bit of a shock.

10:46.560 --> 10:48.479
Thank you, Mr Collett. Joe.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.759
Joe. Joe.

10:50.760 --> 10:53.639
Yeah, well...

10:53.640 --> 10:56.639
I was afraid you wouldn't come.

10:56.640 --> 11:00.280
Here you are.
Mm. Well, of course I am.

11:03.760 --> 11:08.280
How are your legs?
Very comfortable, thanks to you.

11:09.920 --> 11:11.880
Do you mind?
Not at all.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.719
This is luxury, isn't it?

11:18.720 --> 11:21.199
But it is.

11:21.200 --> 11:25.519
When I was young, I would... I'd
never have dreamed of such luxury.

11:25.520 --> 11:29.519
A warm bed at night.
Enough food to eat.

11:32.200 --> 11:35.120
My Sally loved it here.

11:49.160 --> 11:52.559
Twice in one day, I know.
Probably the last thing you want.

11:52.560 --> 11:55.240
But I thought I should drop round
your delivery pack.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.400
Come in.

11:58.720 --> 12:00.919
Did you have any questions or...?

12:00.920 --> 12:03.719
No, you've been kind enough as it is,
bringing this over.

12:03.720 --> 12:05.460
Now, Ted, I'm sure he'd
be full of questions.

12:05.461 --> 12:07.199
Fortunately for you, he's out.

12:07.200 --> 12:10.519
He seems very excited.

12:10.520 --> 12:13.839
It's his first. You must think
we make quite the pair.

12:13.840 --> 12:15.519
Not at all.

12:15.520 --> 12:20.399
My first husband walked out one day
without a word, never came back.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.719
How awful.

12:21.720 --> 12:25.959
With three children to look out for,
I got a job in a paper shop.

12:25.960 --> 12:28.260
Ted used to come in to
that shop every day

12:28.261 --> 12:30.559
and just stare at
this bar of chocolate

12:30.560 --> 12:32.679
and he'd leave without saying a word.

12:32.680 --> 12:33.840
I thought he was mad.

12:33.841 --> 12:38.279
Anyway, finally I ask him,
"What are you up to?"

12:38.280 --> 12:40.320
And he says his wife
used to love that chocolate.

12:40.321 --> 12:44.159
Then I started talking to him
whenever he came in,

12:44.160 --> 12:46.999
and soon enough,
he asked me to the pictures.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.199
A year later, we were married.

12:49.200 --> 12:50.879
That's lovely.

12:50.880 --> 12:56.839
Truth be told, I...
I didn't marry him for love.

12:56.840 --> 12:58.919
It was for my children.

12:58.920 --> 13:01.640
Making a future for 'em, a life.

13:02.880 --> 13:06.800
But he's so kind, so patient.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.519
As time went by, I...
I knew I hadn't done the wrong thing.

13:13.520 --> 13:16.119
But...

13:16.120 --> 13:18.479
What's wrong, Mrs Lawson?

13:22.520 --> 13:25.639
Nurse? Everything all right?

13:25.640 --> 13:29.559
Absolutely. I just came
to drop round the delivery pack.

13:29.560 --> 13:33.079
And that's all fine,
so I should probably be on my way.

13:33.080 --> 13:34.879
I went to get some books.

13:34.880 --> 13:37.999
Margaret Myles, Midwifery.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.199
Grantly Dick-Read,
Childbirth Without Fear.

13:40.200 --> 13:43.480
You'll know more than me
by the time you've read that lot!

13:44.920 --> 13:46.840
I'll see you both soon.

13:49.640 --> 13:57.199
We were only 16 apiece, but I knew she
was the only girl in the world for me.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.679
She agreed to wait
until I got back from the war.

14:01.680 --> 14:03.920
Three years she waited.

14:05.280 --> 14:08.600
And she was the reason
I came back at all.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.879
How romantic!

14:11.880 --> 14:14.359
That's my one weakness.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.639
What about you?

14:18.640 --> 14:21.719
You must surely have a beau
in your life?

14:21.720 --> 14:24.039
Not really, Mr Collett.
I'm far too busy.

14:24.040 --> 14:27.879
Never! A lively young girl
like you? I don't believe it.

14:27.880 --> 14:30.799
There'll be plenty of time for
romance when I'm older.

14:30.800 --> 14:33.079
Now, how about some more
of those biscuits?

14:33.080 --> 14:36.400
Of course.
No, I'll get them.

14:42.400 --> 14:43.799
Are you all right?

14:43.800 --> 14:46.519
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

14:46.520 --> 14:50.279
I... Do you know,
I really think I should be going.

14:50.280 --> 14:51.360
Yeah, of course.

14:51.361 --> 14:55.679
You've... you've had a day's work
today and you need your beauty sleep.

14:55.680 --> 14:58.880
No, no, don't get up.
I'll... I'll see myself out.

15:31.720 --> 15:35.319
How was the old man? He must have been
handsome to keep you out so late.

15:35.320 --> 15:38.439
I had the most terrifying
experience.

15:38.440 --> 15:42.360
I looked down and saw,
right on the table...

15:43.880 --> 15:47.080
there were hundreds of insects.

15:48.880 --> 15:51.679
Just crawling about!
Those.

15:51.680 --> 15:53.839
Yes, they are a nuisance.

15:53.840 --> 15:58.039
It was revolting. It set off
my asthma. You poor thing.

15:58.040 --> 16:00.839
Some of the insects I saw in India
were as big as your hand,

16:00.840 --> 16:03.460
and their jaws, you
saw every sharp

16:03.461 --> 16:06.079
glistening tooth, like,
trying to bite you.

16:06.080 --> 16:08.439
Sorry.

16:08.440 --> 16:09.920
All the tenements are
full of insects.

16:09.921 --> 16:11.400
I'm surprised you hadn't
seen them before.

16:11.401 --> 16:14.119
It's no wonder there's talk
of closing the buildings down.

16:14.120 --> 16:16.879
There's always been talk.
They're not hygienic. It's about time.

16:16.880 --> 16:20.039
I hold the insect in high esteem.

16:20.040 --> 16:25.239
I've often wished I had a thorax
and a small pair of wings.

16:25.240 --> 16:29.279
Who on earth would wish to be an insect?
We are all God's creatures.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.919
And I would have thought you
above all people, Sister,

16:31.920 --> 16:35.199
would appreciate
a more slender thorax.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.919
Behave yourself.

16:36.920 --> 16:39.999
I can't go back there, not with
those things crawling about.

16:40.000 --> 16:43.639
Calm yourself, Nurse Lee.
They do not infest human beings.

16:43.640 --> 16:45.960
And as for never going back there,
it's out of the question.

16:45.961 --> 16:49.399
But, Sister...
Your comfort is not important.

16:49.400 --> 16:53.800
You have a job to do with Mr Collett
and you will do it.

17:38.760 --> 17:40.759
Jimmy?

17:40.760 --> 17:42.839
What on earth are you doing here?

17:42.840 --> 17:46.159
I'm in a bit of a tight spot, Jenny.
Can I come in?

17:46.160 --> 17:47.999
I'm not dressed.

17:48.000 --> 17:49.600
Please?

18:00.160 --> 18:02.880
Thanks, Jen. You're a brick.
(Keep your voice down.)

18:14.640 --> 18:16.880
How long have you been in London?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.359
About seven hours.

18:20.360 --> 18:22.960
I'm sorry. I did come by earlier,
but you were out.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.120
Thank God you've still got
that hideous clock.

18:26.121 --> 18:28.839
I saw it in the window
and I knew I had the right room.

18:28.840 --> 18:30.879
I can't believe you're a nun now.

18:30.880 --> 18:34.359
(I'm not a nun, you fool.
I'm a nurse who works with nuns.)

18:36.600 --> 18:39.439
Thank heavens. You're far
too attractive to be a nun.

18:39.440 --> 18:40.759
Mind your cheek, Jimmy.

18:40.760 --> 18:43.020
If I can't be cheeky
to a girl I've known

18:43.021 --> 18:45.279
for 18 years, then
what hope is there?

18:45.280 --> 18:46.840
What are you doing here?

18:47.880 --> 18:50.719
You remember when you were studying?
I was a bit short of cash.

18:50.720 --> 18:53.479
So Chris and I stayed in the drying
room at the nurses' home.

18:53.480 --> 18:56.759
I do. Three months of nail-biting
fear that you'd be found out.

18:56.760 --> 18:57.840
Why do you mention that?

19:01.840 --> 19:04.519
No. You can't stay here.

19:04.520 --> 19:06.719
A man in Nonnatus House?

19:06.720 --> 19:08.639
I'd be dismissed for sure.

19:08.640 --> 19:10.239
One night.

19:10.240 --> 19:12.480
I've nowhere else to go.

19:16.920 --> 19:18.720
(This way.)

19:22.000 --> 19:26.319
You better be gone by the crack of
dawn. Scout's honour.

19:32.240 --> 19:34.920
I assume there's a story here.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.440
I have no idea.

19:38.600 --> 19:42.760
All told, this might be the strangest
night of my life. Good night.

20:14.200 --> 20:17.039
Your guest made an early departure.

20:17.040 --> 20:21.359
Jimmy's an old friend. He had
nowhere to stay. I didn't think...

20:21.360 --> 20:24.279
Don't worry, Nurse Lee,
I shan't be telling any tales...

20:24.280 --> 20:28.599
since you no doubt caught sight that I
had a few overnight guests of my own.

20:28.600 --> 20:31.279
Yes. They're quails.

20:31.280 --> 20:35.879
I'm a little short of space at home,
and they'll do better in the warm.

20:35.880 --> 20:39.399
It all started with potatoes.
I was growing 'em, see.

20:39.400 --> 20:42.639
But there's no money in spuds,
so I switched to onions.

20:42.640 --> 20:46.159
And onions got me thinking,
naturally, of chickens.

20:46.160 --> 20:47.319
Naturally.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.840
And that got me thinking,
"Well, hang on, Fred.

20:49.841 --> 20:52.359
What about quails?" You know?

20:52.360 --> 20:54.399
Not really.

20:54.400 --> 20:56.679
People are always talking about
chickens.

20:56.680 --> 21:00.919
Chickens this and chickens that,
like they can't do no wrong.

21:00.920 --> 21:05.959
But I say... move over chickens,
there's a new fella in town.

21:05.960 --> 21:07.159
Your quail.

21:07.160 --> 21:08.919
He tastes very similar,

21:08.920 --> 21:12.320
but he's half the size
and twice the price.

21:13.440 --> 21:16.519
Good for you.

21:16.520 --> 21:20.640
Don't worry, Nurse Lee.
I shan't forget you when I'm rich.

21:32.480 --> 21:34.039
I'm telling you, I'm fine.

21:34.040 --> 21:36.319
Shush, just another minute.

21:36.320 --> 21:38.519
This is silly. I've got to do
the washing.

21:38.520 --> 21:41.679
The book says we need to keep alert
for any surges in temperature.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.720
You and your damn books.

21:44.880 --> 21:46.560
Let me help with the washing, love.

21:46.561 --> 21:49.799
The book says you'll be unsteady
on your feet about now.

21:49.800 --> 21:52.359
We don't want you losing
your balance, do we?

21:52.360 --> 21:54.599
I'm not a damned invalid, Ted.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.880
So put those bloody books away
and let me be!

22:16.600 --> 22:18.160
Sorry.

22:19.360 --> 22:21.480
Nothing to apologise for, love.

22:36.560 --> 22:38.640
You seeing that smelly old man again?

22:39.800 --> 22:42.039
Bad enough I've got madam
living on one side,

22:42.040 --> 22:45.959
I've got that disgusting old bugger on
the other, stinking the place out...

22:45.960 --> 22:48.479
I'm telling you, you nurses ought
to have something better to do

22:48.480 --> 22:50.599
than keep running around after him
all the time.

22:58.480 --> 23:01.080
I'm glad you came back.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.639
Of course.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.159
Most kind.

23:10.160 --> 23:13.479
And now, please, you'll join me,

23:13.480 --> 23:15.919
seeing as it's the end of the day.

23:15.920 --> 23:17.520
Allow me.

23:21.760 --> 23:24.719
A reunion of the Scots Guards?
How exciting!

23:24.720 --> 23:28.159
Yes, it's quite an occasion,
you know.

23:28.160 --> 23:31.039
I used to enjoy them a great deal.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.320
You're not going?

23:32.321 --> 23:35.879
Not for years now,
thanks to these legs of mine.

23:38.440 --> 23:40.119
Well, what if I were to take you?

23:40.120 --> 23:43.639
Well, I...
I don't want you to feel obliged.

23:43.640 --> 23:46.480
Mr Collett, it doesn't
seem right that a man who

23:46.481 --> 23:49.320
fought for his country
should be penned up at home.

23:50.760 --> 23:52.959
Besides, it's not every girl
has the opportunity

23:52.960 --> 23:55.199
to dine with so many men in uniform.

23:55.200 --> 23:58.119
You darling girl!

23:58.120 --> 24:01.239
What a day we'll have!

24:01.240 --> 24:03.639
What a day!

24:05.160 --> 24:08.280
In spite of everything,
he stays so cheerful.

24:10.040 --> 24:12.799
I only hope I can be like that
when I'm old.

24:12.800 --> 24:15.600
It sounds like he's had a full life.

24:16.560 --> 24:18.079
More than just work.

24:18.080 --> 24:21.200
Stop it. There's more to me
than work.

24:22.480 --> 24:23.999
I've had my share of adventures.

24:24.000 --> 24:26.159
Have you, now?

24:26.160 --> 24:29.479
When I was 17,
there was a concert in London.

24:29.480 --> 24:32.319
My parents wouldn't let me go,
so I stole out of the window,

24:32.320 --> 24:35.319
hitciked to London,
saw the show anyway.

24:35.320 --> 24:37.840
And that's just the tip of
the iceberg.

24:40.280 --> 24:42.320
Well, well.

24:43.400 --> 24:45.959
What else haven't you told me?

24:45.960 --> 24:48.119
Are you secretly married?

24:48.120 --> 24:50.119
Wouldn't you like to know!

24:50.120 --> 24:52.120
Please.

24:53.240 --> 24:56.199
I'll buy you these hideous earrings
as a bribe.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.480
No, what about these?

25:02.720 --> 25:07.560
Listen, I was hoping I could avail
myself of the boiler room again tonight.

25:10.040 --> 25:13.479
I thought you were studying to be an
architect, not a professional vagrant.

25:13.480 --> 25:17.319
I know, I know,
but rent's so fearfully expensive,

25:17.320 --> 25:20.359
and I can't take any of Mother's
money, she's barely any.

25:20.360 --> 25:23.039
So, I've been going from floor
to floor.

25:23.040 --> 25:25.639
And tonight's floor
has other occupants?

25:25.640 --> 25:27.839
Something like that.

25:27.840 --> 25:29.799
I promise I'll be discreet.

25:29.800 --> 25:31.840
Again.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.959
I'll throw in these.

25:38.160 --> 25:39.599
Fine, fine!

25:39.600 --> 25:43.240
Although I think I know a way
you can pay me back.

25:53.280 --> 25:56.599
Mr Lawson, is your wife
on her way or...?

25:56.600 --> 25:58.959
Actually, it's... it's just me,

25:58.960 --> 26:01.559
if that's allowed.
Of course.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.559
I'm trying to arrange the nursery,
make all the preparations, you know.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.220
I've tried to talk to Winnie
about it, but, well...

26:08.221 --> 26:10.879
she's busy around the house.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.240
We can talk about the
nursery, Mr Lawson,

26:13.241 --> 26:15.599
but is that why
you're really here?

26:17.240 --> 26:19.199
Am I that see-through?

26:19.200 --> 26:21.240
Take a seat.

26:22.520 --> 26:27.519
Truth is, I'm worried about her.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.199
She ain't been herself.

26:29.200 --> 26:33.599
She's been... closed off.
Barely talks to me.

26:33.600 --> 26:36.040
And when she does speak,
she's angry or she's...

26:36.041 --> 26:38.399
crying.

26:38.400 --> 26:39.799
I don't know what to do.

26:39.800 --> 26:43.519
There are a lot of hormonal changes
that happen when you're pregnant.

26:43.520 --> 26:46.439
A lot of women can get rather
emotional.

26:46.440 --> 26:49.399
But you can't take it to heart,
Mr Lawson.

26:49.400 --> 26:51.960
Support her,
and she will get through this.

27:01.440 --> 27:04.119
My goodness!

27:04.120 --> 27:06.439
You look wonderful!

27:06.440 --> 27:09.639
You should have let me help you.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.999
And missed the look on your face?

27:12.000 --> 27:13.520
Jimmy?

27:14.880 --> 27:16.839
Someone call for the cavalry?

27:20.000 --> 27:22.039
I've heard a lot about you,
Mr Collett.

27:22.040 --> 27:26.239
Then you'll know
I prefer to be called Joe.

27:26.240 --> 27:32.640
I'm afraid Jenny hasn't returned the
favour and I know very little about you.

27:34.800 --> 27:37.039
Well, I'm her secret weapon.
Yeah?

27:51.280 --> 27:53.239
Looks like quite a turnout.

28:00.800 --> 28:04.159
Private Joseph Collett.

28:04.160 --> 28:08.559
Now, gentlemen, here is a truly
distinguished old guardsman.

28:08.560 --> 28:11.120
Collett, yes.

28:12.400 --> 28:16.040
- To an esteemed old soldier.
- To an esteemed old soldier!

28:31.200 --> 28:33.999
I... I won't forget this in a hurry.

28:34.000 --> 28:36.039
Thank you, Jenny.

28:36.040 --> 28:37.760
The pleasure is all mine.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.359
Maiden, I do hope
you'll forgive me saying,

28:43.360 --> 28:45.039
but...

28:45.040 --> 28:48.399
I do believe
your young man's sweet on you.

28:50.520 --> 28:54.559
I'm sure I don't know
what you mean. You do!

28:54.560 --> 28:59.079
Now, then, sir, I'm sure you have
many stories you can tell us all.

28:59.080 --> 29:01.239
I don't know.

29:01.240 --> 29:03.359
I do, and he does.

29:06.040 --> 29:08.039
Stand by your beds!

29:08.040 --> 29:12.319
Now, I don't know how many of you
remember your first sergeant major.

29:12.320 --> 29:16.199
The first sergeant major I had
was very fond of poetry...

29:16.200 --> 29:18.000
"Magic Moments" by Perry Como

30:12.240 --> 30:14.120
Excuse me. Can you watch
where you're going, please?

30:14.121 --> 30:16.439
Fred!

30:16.440 --> 30:18.480
You're probably wondering what
I'm doing with all these apples.

30:18.481 --> 30:20.559
I wasn't, really.

30:20.560 --> 30:25.119
Gonna take them home, dip 'em in toffee,
put a stick in, and what have you got?

30:25.120 --> 30:26.519
Toffee apples.

30:26.520 --> 30:30.359
Another business venture?
Huge profit margin in this one.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.639
Good luck with it, Fred.

30:32.640 --> 30:35.239
And be careful!

30:35.240 --> 30:37.839
Your ulcers are improving
wonderfully, Mr Collett.

30:37.840 --> 30:40.480
Joe, please.

30:47.800 --> 30:51.880
What's wrong?
You've been awfully quiet.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.359
They're closing the building.

31:02.360 --> 31:05.079
They're tearing the whole place down.

31:05.080 --> 31:08.679
There's been rumours for years,
of course.

31:08.680 --> 31:11.559
I... I just never thought...

31:11.560 --> 31:13.679
But why?

31:13.680 --> 31:16.359
They say it's unsound.

31:16.360 --> 31:18.439
Lord knows why.

31:18.440 --> 31:21.440
It was still here after the Blitz.

31:22.680 --> 31:28.519
Me and Sally, we were here
over 50 years.

31:28.520 --> 31:30.680
Raised our boys here.

31:32.960 --> 31:34.920
Now, I suppose...

31:36.000 --> 31:39.000
all my ghosts will be cleared
with the rubble.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.120
Will they rest in peace?

31:44.080 --> 31:45.960
I wonder.

31:46.920 --> 31:49.079
Will I?

31:49.080 --> 31:50.999
Where will you go?

31:51.000 --> 31:54.560
St Mark's... in Mile End.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.919
When I was young,
it used to be a workhouse.

31:58.920 --> 32:01.280
It's not right, Mr Collett.

32:02.280 --> 32:04.959
They can't make you leave
your own home, can they?

32:04.960 --> 32:06.759
Now.

32:06.760 --> 32:09.279
Don't bother so.

32:09.280 --> 32:13.080
Don't cry over an old codger
like myself.

32:14.840 --> 32:17.160
It's just a flat, dear.

32:21.400 --> 32:24.039
But the block won't be demolished
immediately.

32:24.040 --> 32:25.759
Why can't Mr Collett stay longer?

32:25.760 --> 32:28.599
At least until we find him somewhere
better than an old workhouse.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.799
Nurse Lee, the decision
has been made.

32:30.800 --> 32:33.519
The buildings are being closed
and the tenants evicted.

32:33.520 --> 32:37.239
The best you can do
is help ease the transition for him.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.500
But it's not fair!
His legs need constant attention.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.760
Who will look after him now?

32:42.800 --> 32:48.039
God once said to St Peter, "When you
are young, you go where you wish.

32:48.040 --> 32:51.120
"When you are old, others will take
you where you do not wish to go."

32:52.640 --> 32:55.759
Is Fred about? The boiler's making
all kinds of noises.

32:55.760 --> 32:58.719
I don't believe
he's currently on the premises.

32:58.720 --> 33:00.620
It sounds like someone's
clattering about in there.

33:00.621 --> 33:02.519
I'm going to take a look.

33:02.520 --> 33:03.919
Sister!

33:03.920 --> 33:06.320
Sister Bernadette!

33:10.880 --> 33:12.799
Sister? Yes?

33:12.800 --> 33:15.919
I was thinking...

33:15.920 --> 33:20.719
we ought to grow more vegetables
in our allotment.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.199
Whatever you please.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.239
I needed your advice.

33:24.240 --> 33:26.079
On what to grow.

33:26.080 --> 33:28.600
Because there's so much choice.

33:30.080 --> 33:32.479
Carrots...

33:32.480 --> 33:34.599
obviously, are helpful,

33:34.600 --> 33:37.439
but also...

33:37.440 --> 33:40.199
cauliflower is delicious.

33:40.200 --> 33:42.839
Do we grow onions? Please stop
wittering about vegetables.

33:42.840 --> 33:45.600
I could not care less.

33:53.360 --> 33:56.799
What are you still doing here?
I overslept. It's so warm in there.

33:56.800 --> 33:58.960
You can't keep coming to stay here,
Jimmy. What if someone comes?

34:04.080 --> 34:06.679
Sister Julienne.

34:06.680 --> 34:09.438
This is Jimmy.
He's an old school friend.

34:09.440 --> 34:11.120
He's here for...

34:12.960 --> 34:15.759
He's an old friend

34:15.760 --> 34:18.279
and... I just moved to Poplar.

34:18.280 --> 34:22.599
I work nearby and...
and dropped in to say hello.

34:26.760 --> 34:30.159
Given the hour, I would be remiss if I
didn't ask you to join us for lunch.

34:30.159 --> 34:32.518
No, no, I couldn't.
Nonsense.

34:32.520 --> 34:34.478
You'd be doing us a great service.

34:34.480 --> 34:38.918
We usually entertain retired
missionaries and visiting preachers.

34:38.920 --> 34:42.960
A lively young man
would be a pleasure for us all.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.999
Winnie!

35:07.120 --> 35:09.119
What's happened? I'm all right.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.439
You're not. You're having
contractions, aren't you?

35:12.440 --> 35:14.439
Leave me be! No, no.

35:14.440 --> 35:16.280
The book says that when
they're this close

35:16.281 --> 35:18.119
together then the
birth's on its way.

35:18.120 --> 35:20.440
We gotta call the midwives.

35:27.120 --> 35:28.759
My word.

35:28.760 --> 35:31.438
If I'd expected this kind of feast, I'd
have worn more forgiving trousers.

35:31.439 --> 35:33.360
Frightfully sorry I'm late.

35:33.361 --> 35:37.119
I just found out my old friend
Binkie's getting spliced at last.

35:39.640 --> 35:43.119
Chummy, this is my friend, Jimmy.
Jimmy, Chummy.

35:43.120 --> 35:46.079
Yes, gosh, marvellous.
Good to meet you.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.119
Mm.

35:48.120 --> 35:52.039
So, James,
you and Nurse Lee are old friends?

35:52.040 --> 35:56.919
We go a long way back.
Jenny's always been good to me...

35:56.920 --> 35:59.879
way back when I used to stay in
the drying room at her nurses' home.

35:59.880 --> 36:03.999
Nurse Lee! Quite the rebel,
were you?

36:04.000 --> 36:06.079
I...

36:07.200 --> 36:10.400
I remember when four
young men were found

36:10.401 --> 36:13.599
in the broom cupboard
at St Thomas's.

36:13.600 --> 36:15.799
We never found the culprits,

36:15.800 --> 36:18.359
which was just... as well!

36:18.360 --> 36:21.399
That's an awfully roomy cupboard.
Were they sleeping standing up?

36:21.400 --> 36:24.359
This is too much. I can't...

36:24.360 --> 36:27.879
I shall never forget...
What happened?

36:27.880 --> 36:30.879
Come on, be a sport.
I couldn't possibly...

36:30.880 --> 36:33.839
Sister, you can't keep them
in suspense.

36:33.840 --> 36:37.559
I shall remember
the hours that we spent.

36:37.560 --> 36:41.519
In age, I'll remember
and not to repent.

36:41.520 --> 36:43.635
Don't say another word, my dear.

36:43.744 --> 36:45.504
'Twill only debase your memories.

36:46.960 --> 36:49.519
Well, now we'll never hear
the end of the story, Sister.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.000
You're quite the spoilsport.

36:51.001 --> 36:54.479
Now, tell me, young man,

36:54.480 --> 36:57.280
when are you two to be married?

36:59.440 --> 37:03.119
No, Jimmy and I are...
are just friends, Sister.

37:03.120 --> 37:04.959
Friends?

37:04.960 --> 37:07.639
No.

37:07.640 --> 37:09.519
I don't think so.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.600
He's very handsome, isn't he?

37:13.446 --> 37:16.286
I knew a young man
that looked like that once.

37:17.520 --> 37:18.960
I think.

37:20.080 --> 37:23.599
Young people have so much licence
today.

37:23.600 --> 37:25.879
It must be so precious

37:25.880 --> 37:28.519
to be young and in love.

37:28.520 --> 37:31.559
Well, no arguments from me, Sister...

37:31.560 --> 37:33.480
though I'm not sure Jenny
would agree.

37:33.481 --> 37:34.927
Sometimes I think she
might be harbouring

37:34.964 --> 37:37.002
secret desires to join
the order herself.

37:44.920 --> 37:48.480
I'm glad you think my personal life
is such a source of amusement.

37:49.440 --> 37:52.080
I didn't mean any harm.

37:53.400 --> 37:55.800
I'll go.

38:06.440 --> 38:09.559
How are you doing, Mrs Lawson?
Not so bad.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.400
You're going to be all right, love.

38:11.401 --> 38:13.598
Just take deep breaths.
I'm right here with you.

38:13.647 --> 38:15.606
Stop it! Just stop it!

38:15.880 --> 38:19.981
Mr Lawson, would you mind popping
downstairs while we examine your wife?

38:20.028 --> 38:21.255
She needs me here.

38:21.289 --> 38:24.608
We need hot water in good supply,
and warm towels.

38:25.040 --> 38:26.759
Right.

38:26.760 --> 38:31.440
Right, of course.
I'll... I'll get right to it.

38:40.960 --> 38:43.560
What is it? You listen.

38:54.680 --> 38:58.120
Fetal heartbeat is slow.
Call Dr Turner, please.

39:04.760 --> 39:07.919
They say we've got to go.
I know.

39:07.920 --> 39:12.359
Go where? Somewhere where no-one'll
know me and I won't know no-one?

39:12.360 --> 39:15.119
It's not right.
Can't you lot do something?

39:15.120 --> 39:18.319
You sisters, you have a say in how
things go on around here, don't you?

39:18.320 --> 39:20.680
There's nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

39:24.760 --> 39:26.280
Joe?

39:46.760 --> 39:48.759
Still falling. Where's Dr Turner?

39:48.760 --> 39:51.439
He said he'd come
as quickly as he could.

39:51.440 --> 39:54.599
Mrs Lawson, we need you
to start pushing.

39:54.600 --> 39:56.039
Now?

39:56.040 --> 39:59.799
But it's too soon. I'm not ready.

40:00.920 --> 40:02.839
Your body's telling you to push.

40:02.840 --> 40:04.640
Your baby wants to come out now.
I can't!

40:04.641 --> 40:07.519
Please, Mrs Lawson.
We're just trying to help you.

40:07.520 --> 40:10.879
I can't have this baby!

40:14.080 --> 40:15.279
I can't!

40:15.280 --> 40:16.999
Yes, you can, my love.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.959
I'm scared!

40:18.960 --> 40:20.480
We're going to take good care of you.
Don't worry.

40:20.481 --> 40:23.119
You don't understand! I'm scared.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.159
What are you so afraid of,
Mrs Lawson?

40:25.160 --> 40:28.440
I'm scared it's going to be black.

40:34.960 --> 40:36.600
I don't care if it's green,
red or orange.

40:36.601 --> 40:40.079
Your child's heart rate is dropping
and I need you to start pushing.

40:40.080 --> 40:41.800
Now.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.559
Perfect. That's just right.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.119
Now I need you to do that again.
I can't.

40:57.120 --> 40:58.279
You have to.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.200
Get the towel ready.
It's an asphyxiation.

41:08.201 --> 41:10.319
What's wrong?

41:10.320 --> 41:12.479
Little one's got the cord
around its neck.

41:12.480 --> 41:13.719
God!

41:13.720 --> 41:15.240
But don't worry.
We'll take care of that.

41:15.241 --> 41:17.239
We've done it plenty of times.

41:17.240 --> 41:20.439
It's too tight.
Get me the clamps.

41:20.440 --> 41:23.519
What's happening?

41:23.520 --> 41:25.360
You're doing
brilliantly, Mrs Lawson.

41:25.361 --> 41:27.439
Now just hold off pushing for me.

41:27.440 --> 41:30.119
Upstairs. Breathe.

41:30.120 --> 41:32.480
And breathe.

41:35.360 --> 41:37.520
I got here as fast as I could.

41:38.960 --> 41:41.479
The cord's clamped now.

41:41.480 --> 41:45.320
Mrs Lawson, we just need to
cut this.

41:46.600 --> 41:48.879
There.

41:48.880 --> 41:53.160
Now, Mrs Lawson,
we just need one last big push.

42:07.400 --> 42:08.520
Now...

42:28.160 --> 42:29.640
There's a heartbeat.

42:30.760 --> 42:35.319
Why isn't my baby crying?
What's happening?

42:35.320 --> 42:37.559
Let's just give it a minute.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.279
Let those lungs adjust.

42:49.480 --> 42:50.600
It's a boy.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.040
Let me see him.

43:20.880 --> 43:24.479
I'll... go and give your husband
the good news.

43:27.160 --> 43:31.039
I'll let you know
when the placenta's delivered.

43:35.160 --> 43:38.039
There, there, now.

43:46.760 --> 43:47.999
It's a boy.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.560
A boy!

43:51.200 --> 43:52.679
My little boy.

43:52.680 --> 43:55.799
It... it's probably best
to wait a little...

43:55.800 --> 43:57.960
until she's... she's ready
for visitors.

43:59.600 --> 44:01.239
Right.

44:01.240 --> 44:03.000
Right.

44:04.080 --> 44:08.840
When Ted and I first married,
I didn't know how lucky I was.

44:10.520 --> 44:12.120
I felt trapped, being with him.

44:13.680 --> 44:15.919
One night, I stayed out late.

44:15.920 --> 44:17.960
I'd had a drink.

44:19.920 --> 44:22.560
That's when I let a navvy
with a nice smile charm me.

44:24.600 --> 44:27.359
One night is all it was.

44:27.360 --> 44:29.360
One night.

44:31.320 --> 44:33.320
It took me so long to find Ted.

44:35.200 --> 44:37.240
To really find him.

44:38.760 --> 44:40.279
Now I'm going to lose him.

44:40.280 --> 44:42.439
You don't know that.

44:42.440 --> 44:44.959
No offence, sweetheart,
but you live and work in a convent.

44:44.960 --> 44:48.880
In the real world, a black baby...

44:56.760 --> 44:59.560
Here.

45:16.960 --> 45:19.719
I reckon we'd best get it over with.

45:30.440 --> 45:32.320
You can come up now, Mr Lawson.

45:38.520 --> 45:42.160
A boy! You don't know
what this means to me, Win...

45:56.680 --> 45:58.680
Can I hold the baby?

46:54.640 --> 46:56.680
Ted...

46:58.840 --> 47:01.760
I don't reckon to know much
about babies...

47:03.280 --> 47:06.679
but I can see how this is the most
beautiful baby in the world.

47:11.120 --> 47:13.119
What are we going to call him?

47:13.120 --> 47:16.840
Why don't you choose, Ted, love?

47:18.440 --> 47:20.560
We'll call him Edward, then.

47:21.880 --> 47:23.920
Good old family name.

47:25.400 --> 47:27.320
My son, Ted.

47:36.680 --> 47:38.839
My word!

47:38.840 --> 47:40.679
Do you think he didn't notice?

47:40.680 --> 47:43.999
He was emotional, excited.
He wasn't thinking straight.

47:44.000 --> 47:46.639
Or he chose to ignore it,
because he loves his wife

47:46.640 --> 47:50.800
and wants to spend his life
with her. Time will tell, I suppose.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.879
Constable Noakes!

47:57.880 --> 47:59.840
What are you... what are you
doing here?

47:59.841 --> 48:02.560
Actually I'm...
I'm here to see Fred.

48:08.600 --> 48:11.599
What can I do for you,
Constable Noakes?

48:11.600 --> 48:14.039
I came to warn you
about your toffee apples.

48:14.040 --> 48:17.039
There's been complaints that...

48:17.040 --> 48:19.479
there are feathers stuck
to some of your apples.

48:19.480 --> 48:22.719
What's a few feathers here and
there? Don't make no difference.

48:22.720 --> 48:25.840
There have also been reports
that some apples have...

48:26.960 --> 48:30.039
well, that they have blood
on them. What you getting at?

48:30.040 --> 48:33.679
You're slaughtering quails in the same
place you're making toffee apples.

48:33.680 --> 48:35.039
That's illegal, Fred.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.800
There's some safety boffins on their
way to your house to shut you down.

48:40.040 --> 48:41.960
Look, I'll tell
you what this is.

48:41.961 --> 48:43.879
This is persecution,
that's what this is.

48:43.880 --> 48:46.479
This is government interference,
and I won't put up with it.

48:46.480 --> 48:49.679
I won't stand for it. I'll
fight 'em. I'll fight 'em in court.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.220
Or you could just dash
back and take care of

48:52.221 --> 48:54.759
things before they
make their inspection.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.760
Yeah, I could do that, couldn't I?

49:04.880 --> 49:06.639
Evening.

49:06.640 --> 49:08.440
Good evening.

49:12.640 --> 49:14.000
You look well.

49:15.880 --> 49:17.880
Well, and you.

49:25.040 --> 49:27.559
Enough.

49:27.560 --> 49:29.879
I cannot watch any more.

49:29.880 --> 49:31.639
Constable Noakes,

49:31.640 --> 49:35.519
would you like to take Nurse Browne
to the pictures on Friday evening?

49:35.520 --> 49:37.559
I...

49:37.560 --> 49:39.600
Simple question. Yes or no.

49:41.720 --> 49:44.440
Yes. Yes, I would.

49:46.240 --> 49:47.760
Nurse Browne, would you like to go?

49:49.640 --> 49:51.279
I'd love to.

49:51.280 --> 49:52.919
Excellent.

49:52.920 --> 49:55.719
How marvellous for you both.

49:55.720 --> 49:58.040
Now I can get on and enjoy my cake.

50:04.160 --> 50:06.480
Have you come to scrounge a bed
again? Because I'm not in the mood.

50:06.481 --> 50:08.559
I came to apologise.

50:08.560 --> 50:10.359
I brought chocolates.

50:10.360 --> 50:13.680
I'm sorry I offended you at
the lunch. I meant nothing by it.

50:17.440 --> 50:19.220
I may be private about
my feelings, Jimmy.

50:19.221 --> 50:20.999
It doesn't mean I'm
about to become a nun.

50:21.000 --> 50:22.999
I know.

50:23.000 --> 50:24.799
It was a joke...

50:24.800 --> 50:27.360
and not a very good one.

50:28.360 --> 50:30.400
It was no way to repay your kindness
for the last few weeks.

50:34.160 --> 50:35.520
I'm on my way out.

50:38.880 --> 50:41.360
I promise not to come bothering you
any more.

50:47.040 --> 50:48.280
Bye.

51:26.280 --> 51:29.359
I told you I'd visit, Mr Collett.

51:29.360 --> 51:34.039
My maiden! You... you've come here.

51:34.040 --> 51:35.720
I went to your flat and
got quite a surprise.

51:35.721 --> 51:37.399
Yeah. I'm sorry.

51:37.400 --> 51:40.239
I... I don't like goodbyes.

51:40.240 --> 51:45.159
Besides, you're here now.
And I'm grateful for it.

51:45.160 --> 51:46.519
And you're comfortable?

51:46.520 --> 51:48.399
Yes.

51:48.400 --> 51:51.759
Doing very nicely, thank you.

51:51.760 --> 51:57.159
How are your legs? A little bit
itchy now and again, yeah.

51:57.160 --> 52:00.079
Did you know
they don't let you smoke in here?

52:00.080 --> 52:03.839
You're only allowed out on the steps,

52:03.840 --> 52:07.240
and I can't find anyone to take me.

52:09.840 --> 52:12.080
They're very busy, I suppose.

52:16.240 --> 52:18.359
Well, I'm not.

52:18.360 --> 52:21.159
Mm.

52:21.160 --> 52:23.440
Sheer luxury.

52:31.360 --> 52:33.719
Are they looking after you here,
Joe?

52:33.720 --> 52:36.079
Hush, hush. Enough of that.

52:36.080 --> 52:39.000
Let's just enjoy each other's
company, shall we?

52:43.040 --> 52:45.039
How's that young man of yours?

52:45.040 --> 52:47.279
He's not my...
Not your young man.

52:47.280 --> 52:50.080
I know. I know.

52:52.880 --> 52:55.599
I miss my family.

52:55.600 --> 52:59.759
Their absence is an ache
I feel every waking moment.

52:59.760 --> 53:05.440
But if you open yourself to love, it
follows you open yourself to heartache.

53:06.880 --> 53:11.480
You'll know the secret of life,
my dear, when you know how to love.

54:05.800 --> 54:09.879
Removed from his home
and the care of district nurses,

54:09.880 --> 54:13.159
Joe could not be given
the necessary care.

54:13.160 --> 54:15.079
His ulcers became gangrenous

54:15.080 --> 54:18.879
and both legs had to be amputated
at the knee.

54:28.280 --> 54:30.000
It's me, Mr Collett.

54:32.320 --> 54:34.360
Joe, it's me.

54:36.480 --> 54:38.600
Jenny.

54:39.600 --> 54:42.199
My legs are itching.

54:42.200 --> 54:46.199
Could you...
could you scratch them, my maiden?

54:46.200 --> 54:48.440
They're terribly itchy.

54:49.600 --> 54:51.680
Of course I will.

54:56.120 --> 54:58.440
Don't cry, my dear.

54:59.400 --> 55:00.759
I'll...

55:00.760 --> 55:02.320
I'll be all right.

56:02.440 --> 56:06.879
Joe died soon after his operation.

56:06.880 --> 56:09.559
There was no Last Post.

56:09.560 --> 56:12.239
No solemn drum roll.

56:12.240 --> 56:14.160
No final salute.

56:28.720 --> 56:31.879
Joe remembered me in his will.

56:31.880 --> 56:35.120
He didn't have to,
for I would not forget him.

56:36.320 --> 56:39.239
I'd seen so many lives begin,

56:39.240 --> 56:41.999
but it was the end of his
that opened up my heart.

56:42.000 --> 56:44.760
"You're Just In Love"
by Perry Como

57:21.440 --> 57:23.759
Mr Lawson.

57:23.760 --> 57:26.119
How is the little one?

57:26.120 --> 57:30.319
Some kind of cough, I think. Thought
I'd better get him looked at.

57:32.720 --> 57:35.079
He still seems besotted.

57:35.080 --> 57:37.559
He certainly does.

57:40.440 --> 57:43.159
Ted loved purely and completely...

57:43.160 --> 57:46.559
and he asked no questions.

57:46.560 --> 57:49.039
And in the end,
nor did anybody else.

57:52.200 --> 57:54.840
To Joe.

57:56.360 --> 57:58.400
My friend.

57:59.800 --> 58:00.839
To Joe.

58:09.400 --> 58:11.680
It seems I'm going to a dance...
voluntarily.

58:12.760 --> 58:15.200
Aren't we the lucky fellows?

58:17.480 --> 58:21.159
Gillian! Have you seen my baby?
She was in her pram!

58:21.160 --> 58:24.439
Please, someone help me! Someone
help me! Someone's taken my baby!

58:24.440 --> 58:26.080
She was overheard stating she
wanted to hurt her baby.

58:26.081 --> 58:27.719
That's utterly ridiculous.

58:27.720 --> 58:30.759
I love her.
I wouldn't hurt her for the world.

58:30.760 --> 58:33.199
Help. Help me. Help me, please.

58:33.200 --> 58:36.679
It will be distressing. Are you sure
you'll be able to handle it?

58:36.680 --> 58:37.879
Of course.
