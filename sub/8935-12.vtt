00:01.534 --> 00:02.168
Down there somewhere, there

00:02.168 --> 00:03.503
Down there somewhere,
there is old Tom!

00:03.503 --> 00:06.673
He's the oldest,
the biggest, wiliest,

00:06.673 --> 00:09.209
fightinest catfish
there ever was!

00:09.209 --> 00:11.478
I wonder if
he's still down there?

00:11.478 --> 00:13.013
Bert, look!

00:13.013 --> 00:15.682
The fishing hole!
It's full of poison.

00:15.682 --> 00:20.086
Everything's dead!
Even old Tom's dead!

00:20.420 --> 00:20.820
the
Evergreen forest.

00:23.490 --> 00:26.126
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.363
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:30.363 --> 00:32.132
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:33.833 --> 00:35.368
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:36.336 --> 00:37.404
Yikes!

00:38.038 --> 00:39.239
Yaaaah...

00:42.308 --> 00:43.643
Yeaaaah!

00:43.643 --> 00:46.679
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:53.887 --> 00:56.523
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:57.924 --> 00:59.259
Cyril Sneer!

01:02.862 --> 01:05.265
And his life would be simple
except for...

01:05.932 --> 01:07.567
the Raccoons!!

01:07.567 --> 01:09.269
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:21.981 --> 01:23.783
Everyone has a
favorite place

01:23.783 --> 01:25.785
to get away from it all.

01:25.785 --> 01:28.254
And for Bert Raccoon and his
friend Cedric,

01:28.254 --> 01:30.824
their favorite spot is also

01:30.824 --> 01:32.725
their best kept secret.

01:33.393 --> 01:34.561
Wow!

01:34.561 --> 01:36.296
Didn't we tell you, Bentley?

01:36.296 --> 01:39.399
The most beautiful spot
in the Evergreen forest!

01:39.399 --> 01:43.236
Not to mention the
most special fishing hole

01:43.236 --> 01:45.839
anywhere, anytime.

01:45.839 --> 01:47.874
So what
makes it so special?

01:47.874 --> 01:51.344
Before I can reveal that
information, little buddy,

01:51.344 --> 01:54.247
you've got to swear
an Oath of Secrecy.

01:54.247 --> 01:55.815
Repeat after me!

01:55.815 --> 01:58.151
I, Bentley Raccoon...

01:58.151 --> 01:59.919
I, Bentley Raccoon.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.822
...do solemnly
swear never to reveal

02:02.822 --> 02:05.692
the location of this
secret fishing hole.

02:05.692 --> 02:07.794
Even if I'm captured by pirates,

02:07.794 --> 02:09.863
and forced to walk the plank!

02:09.863 --> 02:11.431
Ohh, come on, Bert!

02:11.431 --> 02:12.632
I mean it, Bentley.

02:14.000 --> 02:17.303
I do solemnly swear never
to reveal the location

02:17.303 --> 02:19.639
of this secret fishing hole,
even if I'm captured by pirates

02:19.639 --> 02:21.608
and forced to walk the plank!

02:21.608 --> 02:24.644
You are now one
of only three people

02:24.644 --> 02:26.546
in the entire universe

02:26.546 --> 02:29.082
who knows about this place.

02:29.082 --> 02:32.051
Confidentially, me
and Bert are the other two.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.355
Keep your eye on
the pond, Bentley!

02:35.355 --> 02:38.191
Down there somewhere is old Tom.

02:38.191 --> 02:39.826
Ah, he's the oldest,

02:39.826 --> 02:44.097
the biggest, wiliest, fightenest
catfish there ever was!

02:44.097 --> 02:47.400
He's been haunting this
pond for, well,

02:47.400 --> 02:49.669
forever, as far as we know!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.905
Once a year,
Bert might come out here

02:51.905 --> 02:53.473
to fish for old Tom.

02:53.473 --> 02:55.375
But if old
Tom is so big and old,

02:55.375 --> 02:58.912
I mean, why?! You should
just leave him alone!

02:58.912 --> 03:02.582
Believe me, Old Tom
doesn't need any help from you.

03:02.582 --> 03:05.418
Every year
we try to catch him,

03:05.418 --> 03:06.686
and every year we fail.

03:06.686 --> 03:10.223
I don't think we'll ever catch
Old Tom, and that's okay.

03:10.223 --> 03:12.559
It's kind of a game
between him and us.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.594
Hey!!

03:18.231 --> 03:20.800
Wow! Look
at the size of them!

03:20.800 --> 03:23.036
I can't wait to get
my fishing rod!

03:23.036 --> 03:25.371
Maybe we'll get him
this year, huh, guys?

03:25.371 --> 03:27.807
Yeah.. maybe, Bert.

03:29.409 --> 03:30.710
Wow.

03:32.245 --> 03:34.314
Yahooo!

03:37.417 --> 03:39.919
You haven't got
a clue about advertising!

03:39.919 --> 03:41.487
Says you, Sir!

03:41.487 --> 03:44.657
One of these designs has
got to be on our product labels.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.694
I insist on the
green alternative.

03:47.694 --> 03:50.296
And I say, we call
it the pink alternative!

03:50.296 --> 03:53.066
I say, the
green alternative!

03:53.066 --> 03:54.901
Hi, Pop! Mr Knox?

03:54.901 --> 03:56.903
Still having creative
differences?

03:56.903 --> 03:59.105
Maybe you can
settle it for us, son.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.175
You know Mr Knox and I
are starting up a new company

04:02.175 --> 04:04.877
to produce environmentally
sound products.

04:04.877 --> 04:08.081
I know, Pop, and I'm
very proud of both of you!

04:08.081 --> 04:10.650
We want our
product label to convey

04:10.650 --> 04:14.621
our heartfelt concern
for the environment,

04:14.621 --> 04:17.323
and this is what
we've come up with.

04:17.323 --> 04:18.858
So what do you say, son?

04:19.525 --> 04:22.795
Well, gee, they're...
they're both nice.

04:22.795 --> 04:24.163
But if it were me,

04:24.163 --> 04:26.532
I'd put something on
the label that symbolizes

04:26.532 --> 04:29.002
the unspoiled beauty of nature.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.671
You know, something special.

04:31.671 --> 04:33.273
Something special?

04:34.274 --> 04:37.110
You know, Cedric my boy,
you're a genius!

04:37.110 --> 04:38.845
Gee! Thanks, Pop.

04:38.845 --> 04:40.913
Guess it runs
in the family, hey?

04:40.913 --> 04:43.016
Come on, Knox!

04:43.016 --> 04:45.618
I know exactly what we're
going to put on our labels.

04:46.486 --> 04:48.655
Well, don't just
stand there getting fat!

04:48.655 --> 04:51.357
Grab the camera gear
and get down to the limo.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.526
Pig 1:
I hope this won't take long.

04:53.526 --> 04:56.029
We've got that job
interview tonight.

04:57.830 --> 04:59.866
Pig 2: Are you trying
to ruin everything?

04:59.866 --> 05:01.868
Pig 3: If the boss finds
out we're moonlighting,

05:01.868 --> 05:04.837
we'll never see another
one of his measly paychecks!!

05:04.837 --> 05:06.773
Move it,
you punchy pinheads!

05:09.075 --> 05:13.479
What do you say,
Bentley? Is it me... or
what?

05:13.479 --> 05:15.381
Looks real dumb Bert.

05:15.381 --> 05:16.783
Hi, Mr Willow!

05:16.783 --> 05:19.018
Mr Willow: That time of
year again, is it Bert?

05:19.018 --> 05:22.355
Every year, Bert comes
in to buy a lucky charm,

05:22.355 --> 05:25.224
to help him catch some
mythical giant fish,

05:25.224 --> 05:28.494
who lives in a mysterious
secret fishing hole.

05:28.494 --> 05:29.862
It's true, Mr Willow!

05:29.862 --> 05:32.732
I saw Old Tom, and the
fishing hole's over by the--

05:32.732 --> 05:34.567
Bentley, you promised!

05:34.567 --> 05:36.536
Mr Willow: It's still a
big secret, is it Bert?

05:36.536 --> 05:38.171
It has to be, Mr Willow.

05:38.171 --> 05:40.506
It's the most special
fishing hole anywhere.

05:40.506 --> 05:43.343
See you later, Bert.
I'm gonna check out the comics.

05:43.343 --> 05:44.811
Okay, little buddy!

05:44.811 --> 05:46.612
Um, I see you, Mr Willow.

05:48.047 --> 05:49.749
You witless wieners!

05:49.749 --> 05:51.617
What good is a camera
without film?

05:51.617 --> 05:53.252
Sorry, boss!

05:55.088 --> 05:57.190
So what's all the
excitement, Cyril?

05:57.190 --> 05:59.192
Going on a photo safari?!

05:59.192 --> 06:01.561
Mind your own
beeswax, Raccoon!

06:01.561 --> 06:04.197
You'll hear all about it
at my press conference.

06:04.197 --> 06:07.400
Pig 1:
Panachrome, slides, prints,

06:07.400 --> 06:09.335
400 ASA?

06:09.335 --> 06:12.905
Pig 2: Who cares? Just
get two of each ASAP!!

06:12.905 --> 06:15.875
Hey guys, I know
something about photography.

06:15.875 --> 06:17.276
Let me give you a hand.

06:17.276 --> 06:19.612
Well, I'd love
to stay and chat, Raccoon,

06:19.612 --> 06:21.481
but you have to be
going, don't you?

06:21.481 --> 06:24.417
Be sure to get your cronies
from that Evergreen rag

06:24.417 --> 06:27.153
out to my press conference
and remember...

06:27.153 --> 06:28.788
Save the whales!

06:30.423 --> 06:32.525
Sure, Cyril. Huh?

06:35.962 --> 06:39.031
This had better
be worth it, Mr Sneer!

06:39.031 --> 06:40.400
Guaranteed, Knox!

06:40.400 --> 06:42.802
One look at this place
and you'll fall in love.

06:42.802 --> 06:44.971
It's just what Cedric
was talking about.

06:44.971 --> 06:47.173
Unspoiled beauty of nature!

06:48.975 --> 06:51.077
Woah, yeaaah! Yeeee!

06:54.080 --> 06:55.815
Yessiree, it was my

06:55.815 --> 06:58.284
favorite spot when
I was a young buck.

06:58.284 --> 07:00.319
Kept the place secret for years.

07:00.319 --> 07:01.954
I'm sure.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.790
Funny the things
that are important to you

07:03.790 --> 07:05.291
when you're a kid.

07:05.291 --> 07:07.326
Pig 1: Are we there yet?

07:07.326 --> 07:08.795
Pig 2: Uaaaaah!
Pig 3: Yeaaaaah!

07:08.795 --> 07:11.097
Pig 1: Uuuhh!

07:11.097 --> 07:13.332
Pig 2: We're going to be late
for this job interview.

07:13.332 --> 07:14.934
Pig 3: After a day like today,

07:14.934 --> 07:17.170
who needs a second job?

07:18.471 --> 07:20.940
Mr Sneer, for once,

07:20.940 --> 07:24.043
I'm in whole hearted
agreement with y'all.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.447
I think it is the perfect choice

07:27.447 --> 07:29.315
for our corporate symbol.

07:29.315 --> 07:31.017
Owww!

07:31.017 --> 07:33.352
Quit loafing
and make with the camera!

07:33.352 --> 07:34.654
Yes, boss!

07:35.455 --> 07:38.858
I spent many an afternoon
here trying to catch Old Tom.

07:38.858 --> 07:41.127
Wonder if he's still down there?

07:43.029 --> 07:45.531
No one knows about
this place, Knox!

07:45.531 --> 07:47.533
No one! So,

07:47.533 --> 07:48.968
if you don't mind,

07:48.968 --> 07:50.970
let's keep it under our hats.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.272
I understand, Sir.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.874
I had a place like this

07:54.874 --> 07:58.010
when I was just a
tyke on the Bayou.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.715
Pig 1: Why do we have
to go to a job interview

08:02.715 --> 08:04.183
in the middle of the night?

08:04.183 --> 08:06.686
Pig 2: Well, we
are moonlighting.

08:06.686 --> 08:09.856
Pig 3: Just remember
why we need the money, boys.

08:10.890 --> 08:14.527
The Thunder clap RX-4000

08:14.527 --> 08:17.029
Stereo entertainment unit.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.065
Pig 2:
Infrared remote

08:19.065 --> 08:21.667
for easy armchair operation!

08:21.667 --> 08:24.237
Pig 1: Oh, I can't wait to hear

08:24.237 --> 08:26.239
Woodchuck Berry on that baby.

08:26.239 --> 08:28.407
Pig 3: Right, men, let's do it!

08:31.143 --> 08:33.746
♪ (suspenseful music) ♪

08:41.554 --> 08:43.322
Oh!
Milton Midas:

08:43.322 --> 08:46.325
Come on in, boys. Come on in!

08:46.325 --> 08:48.160
Here about the job, right?

08:49.028 --> 08:50.329
Pig 1: Y-yes, Sir.

08:50.329 --> 08:52.198
Pig 2: But if it's
taken already, he-he...

08:52.198 --> 08:55.234
we'll just be--
Oh no, no, indeed.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.036
I've been hoping to find three

08:57.036 --> 09:00.006
stout fellows like
yourselves. Yes!

09:00.006 --> 09:02.942
Hard workers, who
don't ask questions,

09:02.942 --> 09:05.545
and like the crisp sound of

09:05.545 --> 09:08.447
$1,000 bills.

09:08.447 --> 09:11.684
Ohh, we love
that sound, sir!

09:13.352 --> 09:15.588
I want you to dispose

09:15.588 --> 09:17.857
of those barrels for me.

09:17.857 --> 09:19.458
Tomorrow night!

09:19.458 --> 09:21.193
Pig 3: T-t-that's it?!

09:21.193 --> 09:23.863
Pig 2: For a thousand dollars?

09:23.863 --> 09:25.565
Pig 1: See you
tomorrow night, sir.

09:25.565 --> 09:27.800
Pig 2: You can count on us, sir!

09:32.371 --> 09:35.107
Kids...

09:35.107 --> 09:37.076
He-he!

09:37.076 --> 09:39.345
Kids!

09:41.147 --> 09:44.183
This stuff is great,
Knox! What is it?

09:44.183 --> 09:46.252
Why, these are our new

09:46.252 --> 09:48.321
whole grained health nut

09:48.321 --> 09:50.456
oat bland squares.

09:50.456 --> 09:51.924
Blah!

09:51.924 --> 09:54.126
Do we have anything
in a meat flavor?

09:54.126 --> 09:58.631
Boy, Cyril and Mr Knox
as environmental crusaders.

09:58.631 --> 10:00.266
Isn't that incredible?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.935
Yeah.
Cyril's come a long way!

10:02.935 --> 10:05.071
Yeah, that's my Pop.

10:05.071 --> 10:09.141
Pig 1: Ehm-ehm,
ladies and gentlemen!

10:09.141 --> 10:11.811
Your attention please!

10:11.811 --> 10:15.448
Pig 2: Introducing
the men of the hour,

10:15.448 --> 10:17.883
those paladins
against pollution,

10:17.883 --> 10:21.320
Cyril Sneer and Mr Knox!

10:24.457 --> 10:26.792
Thank y'all
for dropping by.

10:26.792 --> 10:30.329
Today, Mr Sneer and I

10:30.329 --> 10:31.897
joined the good fight

10:31.897 --> 10:33.699
against pollution,

10:33.699 --> 10:37.503
with environmentally
hospitable products.

10:39.271 --> 10:40.673
Hey, where
are they all going?

10:40.673 --> 10:42.708
That's the trouble
with the press, Bert.

10:42.708 --> 10:45.044
Good news is no news.

10:45.044 --> 10:47.246
We'll offer
phosphate-free detergent,

10:47.246 --> 10:50.216
unbleached coffee filters,
biodegradable plastics,

10:50.216 --> 10:52.451
and the symbol of our
commitment to a better world

10:52.451 --> 10:54.687
will appear on every package!

10:54.687 --> 10:56.589
Rippling Pond!

10:56.589 --> 10:59.225
Be sure to look for it
at your local store,

10:59.225 --> 11:01.060
at competitive prices!

11:03.629 --> 11:08.000
(gasps) Cedric!
That's our secret fishing hole!

11:08.000 --> 11:10.403
Uh... not any more, Bert.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.973
Of course
I can't tell you

11:13.973 --> 11:15.574
where the secret
fishing hole is,

11:15.574 --> 11:17.910
because it's a secret.
Uh huh.

11:17.910 --> 11:21.147
And everyone knows,
girls can't keep a secret.

11:21.147 --> 11:24.383
Oh, absolutely true
Bentley, absolutely true.

11:25.217 --> 11:26.919
Betcha'd love to
know where it is, though!

11:26.919 --> 11:29.221
Not really.
Ohh, sure.

11:30.056 --> 11:31.924
I bet, you're dying to know. Nope.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.727
Girls...

11:34.727 --> 11:37.763
And here come the only other
two guys in the universe

11:37.763 --> 11:39.065
who know where it is.

11:39.065 --> 11:41.067
Hi, guys. I'm all ready!

11:41.067 --> 11:44.270
Boy, I can't wait to go to
our secret fishing hole.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.105
Guys?

11:46.739 --> 11:49.442
The secret is not
a secret anymore, Bentley,

11:49.442 --> 11:50.943
somebody told.

11:51.911 --> 11:54.313
It wasn't me,
guys. I'd never tell!

11:54.313 --> 11:56.615
He's been trying
to tell me all day.

11:56.615 --> 12:00.519
I knew it! I didn't
tell and Cedric didn't tell!

12:00.519 --> 12:01.921
And seeing as there were only

12:01.921 --> 12:04.657
three people in the
universe who know,

12:04.657 --> 12:06.759
you must have told.

12:06.759 --> 12:08.561
But I...
I saw you talking

12:08.561 --> 12:11.063
to the Pigs in
Mr Willow's store yesterday,

12:11.063 --> 12:13.632
and today Cyril's got
a humongous picture

12:13.632 --> 12:16.402
of our fishing hole
hanging from the ceiling!

12:16.402 --> 12:19.305
You just had to tell
someone, didn't you? Huh?

12:19.939 --> 12:21.574
Come on, Cedric, let's go!

12:23.509 --> 12:26.612
But Burt, I...I didn't!

12:29.448 --> 12:32.518
We're all loaded up, sir.
Good!

12:32.518 --> 12:35.988
Pig 2: Uh, by the way, sir,
what's in the barrels?

12:35.988 --> 12:39.759
I believe we
agreed, no questions.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.330
Pig 3: Ohh, absolutely, Sir.
Oh, no questions.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.366
Uh, where should we
dump the barrels?

12:47.366 --> 12:50.770
I'm paying you
to use your brains.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.004
Find a place.

12:52.004 --> 12:53.606
Pig 1: Consider it done, Sir.

12:53.606 --> 12:54.840
Ciao.

13:02.515 --> 13:04.450
Eh... kids!

13:07.753 --> 13:09.321
Pig 1: That's far enough, Lloyd!

13:09.321 --> 13:11.457
It looks like as
good a place as any.

13:15.694 --> 13:17.530
Pig 2: Out of sight,
out of mind!

13:17.530 --> 13:19.165
That's what I always say!

13:19.165 --> 13:21.801
Let's go, boys.
Mission accomplished!

13:34.814 --> 13:35.281
Um, maybe we should

13:35.281 --> 13:36.715
Um, maybe we
should have let Bentley

13:36.715 --> 13:38.517
come along anyway, Bert.

13:38.517 --> 13:42.054
I mean, he probably didn't
mean to let the secret out.

13:42.054 --> 13:44.657
Yeah, well, he did.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.659
And I'm still mad at him.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.628
So are you gonna
stay mad at him forever?

13:49.628 --> 13:53.032
Ohh no,
you're right, Cedric.

13:53.032 --> 13:54.900
Let's go back and get Bentley.

13:56.068 --> 13:58.838
Oh, no! Bert, look!

13:59.738 --> 14:00.739
What the..?

14:01.340 --> 14:02.942
What's going on?

14:07.580 --> 14:09.548
I figured it all out.

14:09.548 --> 14:11.584
After we buy the stereo,

14:11.584 --> 14:13.519
we'll have enough money leftover

14:13.519 --> 14:15.721
for five new albums!

14:15.721 --> 14:17.089
Pig 2: Woohoo, great!

14:17.089 --> 14:19.558
There's a new Sam Ham
and The Spare Ribs record.

14:19.558 --> 14:23.028
Pig 3: Oh, I want the
Jeff Squeally Band album.

14:23.028 --> 14:27.166
Oi! His guitar just sends me...
I'll send you!

14:27.166 --> 14:31.103
I'll send you packing! Now cut
the gab fest and get to work!

14:34.840 --> 14:36.208
Not bad, eh Knox?

14:36.208 --> 14:39.245
I never thought
I'd see the day, Mr Sneer.

14:39.245 --> 14:40.846
You and me,

14:40.846 --> 14:43.682
working together
for a better world.

14:43.682 --> 14:45.851
Well, as long as
a better world means

14:45.851 --> 14:48.020
better profits, I'm all for it!

14:48.020 --> 14:50.356
Um, Mr Sneer,

14:50.356 --> 14:52.358
I wonder if I could talk to you?

14:53.025 --> 14:55.261
Privately.
Certainly, Bentley.

14:55.261 --> 14:56.962
If you'll excuse me, Knox.

14:56.962 --> 14:59.098
I believe I'll
head home for lunch.

14:59.098 --> 15:00.900
What's on your mind, son?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.768
It's about
the fishing hole.

15:02.768 --> 15:06.038
See, Bert and Cedric were the
only people in the universe

15:06.038 --> 15:07.940
who knew about it,
and they told me.

15:07.940 --> 15:10.576
And now Bert thinks I told
the pigs and they told you,

15:10.576 --> 15:11.944
and I didn't!! And...

15:12.645 --> 15:14.580
Could you talk to
Bert and Cedric?

15:14.580 --> 15:17.583
Bentley, I've known
about the old fishing hole

15:17.583 --> 15:20.619
since I was knee high
to a net profit.

15:20.619 --> 15:21.820
You have?!

15:21.820 --> 15:24.089
Did you ever see old Tom?

15:24.089 --> 15:27.826
Yes, Sir.
Me and old Tom go way back!

15:27.826 --> 15:30.796
I thought that fishing hole
was my best-kept secret,

15:30.796 --> 15:33.966
'til I found out my dad
used to fish there too.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.769
I guess you could say the
secret of the fishing hole

15:36.769 --> 15:38.570
has a long history, Bentley.

15:38.570 --> 15:40.673
It's nice to know
it's still a secret.

15:40.673 --> 15:42.841
But it isn't.
Sure it is!

15:42.841 --> 15:45.311
I'm not going to tell
the world where it is,

15:45.311 --> 15:47.980
I'm just using the
picture for promotion.

15:49.081 --> 15:51.583
And don't worry, I'll
explain to Bert and Cedric.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.419
Pop... Pop!!
Uh?!!

15:53.419 --> 15:54.753
It's horrible!

15:54.753 --> 15:58.090
The fishing hole,
it's full of poison!

15:58.090 --> 16:02.628
Everything's dead!
Even old Tom's dead!

16:03.295 --> 16:04.496
Old Tom?

16:05.297 --> 16:07.032
Pigs, get the car!

16:08.968 --> 16:13.005
Somebody just
dumped this... this poison.

16:13.005 --> 16:14.506
How could they do it?

16:14.506 --> 16:16.775
They just
didn't care, Bert.

16:16.775 --> 16:19.178
We'd better get
these barrels out of here.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.447
No!
This stuff's dangerous!

16:21.447 --> 16:23.215
We need professional help!

16:23.215 --> 16:25.851
I'll call Professor
Smedley-Smyth, Pop.

16:25.851 --> 16:27.152
Maybe he can help?

16:27.152 --> 16:28.387
Good idea, son!

16:29.722 --> 16:31.457
How bad is it, professor?

16:32.958 --> 16:35.361
Ohh, that bad, eh?

16:35.361 --> 16:36.829
So what about the pond?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.197
Do you think we could sa--

16:40.332 --> 16:41.900
Oh, that long, eh?

16:41.900 --> 16:43.535
Thanks, professor.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.405
Yeah. I'm sorry too.

16:47.639 --> 16:50.809
Boys, we're going to
find out who did this,

16:50.809 --> 16:52.745
if it's the last thing we do!

16:53.846 --> 16:56.582
Um.. we did it, boss.

16:56.582 --> 16:58.017
You what?!?

16:58.017 --> 17:01.020
It was just a job, boss!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.255
Pig 2: We don't even
know who hired us.

17:03.255 --> 17:06.592
Pig 3: We didn't know what
was in the barrels, boss.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.227
Pig 1: He wouldn't tell us.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.928
Pig 2: He just told
us to dump them.

17:09.928 --> 17:13.232
Pig 3: He... He
paid us
a lot of money.

17:14.433 --> 17:16.335
He paid you
a lot of money?

17:17.536 --> 17:21.240
You want money?
Here! Here's lots of money.

17:22.374 --> 17:24.276
Take it all! Take some more!

17:24.276 --> 17:26.578
Just give me back
the fishing hole!

17:26.578 --> 17:29.548
Can you do that? Can you
give me a price on that?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.716
Can you?!?

17:33.218 --> 17:34.920
Well, you'll never regret

17:34.920 --> 17:37.156
investing in our
newest enterprise.

17:37.156 --> 17:39.358
Yes, right here in the
Evergreen forest!

17:39.358 --> 17:43.228
We're about to make a
staggering amount of money!

17:43.228 --> 17:45.230
We'll laugh all the
way to the bank!

17:46.265 --> 17:48.767
Midas!?
Eh?! Aah...

17:48.767 --> 17:50.536
Mr Sneer, Mr Knox.

17:50.536 --> 17:53.372
Well, how nice to see you!

17:53.372 --> 17:56.108
And you couldn't have come at a
more opportune moment because...

17:56.108 --> 17:58.744
You own a warehouse
down near Beaver Bite Swamp?

17:58.744 --> 18:01.647
Uh-eh-oh... why, no.

18:01.647 --> 18:04.383
Don't bother
to deny it, Sir.

18:04.383 --> 18:06.919
We already checked it out.

18:06.919 --> 18:10.556
Ohh, that warehouse!

18:10.556 --> 18:12.091
Yes, yes, yes!
Now that you mention it...

18:12.091 --> 18:17.062
We're here to return some
of your missing property, Midas.

18:17.062 --> 18:19.164
All right, boys, bring it in!

18:19.164 --> 18:21.667
What the..?!

18:28.173 --> 18:29.308
Wait!!

18:29.308 --> 18:31.443
Yikes!!

18:31.443 --> 18:34.113
Pig 1: Here's your
money back, Mr Midas!

18:34.113 --> 18:35.981
Pig 2: Yeah, we don't want it!

18:35.981 --> 18:38.350
Pig 3: We wish we'd
never even seen it!

18:38.350 --> 18:39.918
Gentlemen, gentlemen,

18:39.918 --> 18:43.155
I'm sure, we can come to some
accommodation here.

18:43.155 --> 18:45.924
Ohh, I know we can, Sir.

18:45.924 --> 18:49.828
In fact, we've arranged
some accommodation for you!

18:49.828 --> 18:52.331
No wait!!
You-you got it all wrong.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.500
It was an accident. Trust me!!

18:54.500 --> 18:55.801
Noooo!!!

18:57.436 --> 19:00.906
That's my Pop,
the environmental crusader!

19:03.342 --> 19:06.445
Watch it, boys.
That stuff is deadly!

19:06.445 --> 19:09.982
And it's going to stay
deadly for a few generations.

19:09.982 --> 19:13.986
Gee, and all you guys
knew about this place.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.054
Me and Cedric thought
it was our secret.

19:16.822 --> 19:18.390
Hey, I'm sorry for thinking

19:18.390 --> 19:20.025
you spilled the beans,
little buddy.

19:20.025 --> 19:22.561
That's okay, Bert.
I guess everyone tries

19:22.561 --> 19:24.496
to protect the things
that they love.

19:24.496 --> 19:26.331
I wish we'd
done a better job.

19:26.331 --> 19:30.736
Because when you think about it,
this pond wasn't just ours.

19:30.736 --> 19:33.005
It belonged to everybody.

19:33.005 --> 19:34.740
It was a good place.

19:34.740 --> 19:36.375
At least we've got our memories.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.244
I don't!
I never got the chance.

19:39.244 --> 19:40.746
Maybe not, Bentley,

19:40.746 --> 19:43.348
but feeling sorry about
it won't change anything.

19:44.216 --> 19:47.152
You're right,
Cedric, it's up to us.

19:47.152 --> 19:49.154
We've got to change things.

19:50.255 --> 19:52.357
Each one of us
has a special place,

19:52.357 --> 19:54.526
just like the Evergreen forest,

19:54.526 --> 19:57.396
enchanting, sparkling
and perfect.

19:57.396 --> 20:01.066
And like the flowers that
bloom there... fragile.
