00:01.137 --> 00:03.034
Previously on "Batwoman"...

00:03.036 --> 00:05.712
Kate, it's Mary. Sophie's missing.

00:05.714 --> 00:07.155
- Kate.
- Hey, Dad.

00:07.157 --> 00:09.359
- We're gonna find her.
- Then let me help.

00:09.362 --> 00:10.835
Who the hell are you?

00:10.838 --> 00:12.260
I'm Alice.

00:12.263 --> 00:13.962
Bruce never stopped looking

00:13.964 --> 00:15.060
for your sister's body.

00:15.063 --> 00:17.223
Guy had the best tech on the planet.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.097
Why didn't he find her?

00:19.100 --> 00:20.516
Pick one, Commander...

00:20.519 --> 00:23.092
Sophie or... Gotham.

00:23.095 --> 00:24.531
Why are you doing this?

00:24.534 --> 00:26.811
Hyah!

00:26.814 --> 00:29.389
I am not used to being found.

00:29.392 --> 00:30.441
Clever girl.

00:30.444 --> 00:31.685
Let's take a picture, Beth.

00:31.688 --> 00:34.455
Make sure our necklaces are in it.

00:34.458 --> 00:36.002
Beth.

00:42.859 --> 00:45.234
Mom! Mom, wake up!

00:45.236 --> 00:46.697
Tell me something, Bruce.

00:46.699 --> 00:48.891
What's the difference
between being hopeful

00:48.894 --> 00:50.274
and being crazy?

00:50.277 --> 00:51.593
Kate!

00:51.596 --> 00:53.023
Because whatever it is got me

00:53.025 --> 00:55.478
through that day and
the years that followed.

00:55.481 --> 00:58.172
Mom, Beth!

00:58.175 --> 01:01.176
Beth wasn't found in
the car with my mom,

01:01.178 --> 01:03.533
and as long as there wasn't a body,

01:03.536 --> 01:05.161
there was hope.

01:05.164 --> 01:07.927
The entire city went out
looking that first night...

01:09.200 --> 01:11.093
But days went by

01:11.096 --> 01:13.471
and then weeks and then months,

01:13.473 --> 01:16.330
and eventually, it
was just my dad and me.

01:16.333 --> 01:18.934
- Beth!
- Beth!

01:18.937 --> 01:20.478
A decade and a half later,

01:20.480 --> 01:22.772
and my dad and I are still looking,

01:22.774 --> 01:24.699
but while I'm looking for my sister,

01:24.701 --> 01:27.339
my dad is looking for
someone else entirely.

01:27.342 --> 01:32.102
Alice is a lunatic, Dodgson a traitor,

01:32.105 --> 01:35.326
a former Crow turned Wonderland
Gang second in command.

01:35.328 --> 01:38.176
Together, they want to
terrorize the citizens of Gotham

01:38.179 --> 01:42.272
by undermining the people
actually protecting them... us.

01:45.722 --> 01:47.736
I want them stopped...

01:47.739 --> 01:49.548
Dead or alive.

02:01.771 --> 02:04.623
- Let's go.
- Yeah. Let's bounce.

02:22.894 --> 02:24.744
Cool.

02:40.351 --> 02:41.893
Where's Alice?

02:49.082 --> 02:51.225
What the hell is that?

02:56.201 --> 02:58.409
My dad would never believe my theory

02:58.411 --> 03:01.078
that Alice was Beth, but
I didn't have a choice.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.964
I had to make him understand

03:02.966 --> 03:05.484
before the Crows killed her first.

-- <font color=#138CE9>www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

03:52.349 --> 03:54.423
3 hours later, where the hell were you?

03:54.426 --> 03:56.594
- Around.
- Did anyone see you...

03:56.597 --> 03:59.095
Bystanders, police,
cameras, cell phones?

03:59.097 --> 04:01.265
Seriously, Kate. You can't
be going out in Gotham

04:01.268 --> 04:03.349
every night pretending to be Batman.

04:03.351 --> 04:05.619
I need to find her.

04:09.941 --> 04:12.792
If Alice is my sister, I need to know.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.369
Good morning, Gotham.

04:14.371 --> 04:16.161
Your bestie Vesper Fairchild here.

04:16.165 --> 04:17.998
On a normal Tuesday, I'd want to know

04:18.000 --> 04:20.553
who wore who to last
night's Gotham Gala,

04:20.555 --> 04:22.722
who got drunk, who got clawed,

04:22.725 --> 04:25.123
but Batman fever is upon us, people.

04:25.126 --> 04:28.363
It has been 4 days
since we saw him soaring

04:28.366 --> 04:30.051
through the sky, and it's still

04:30.053 --> 04:31.369
all anyone can tweet about.

04:31.371 --> 04:34.574
Is Batman finally back
after a 3-year hiatus?

04:34.577 --> 04:35.716
Talk to me, Gotham.

04:35.719 --> 04:36.767
I think it's him.

04:36.770 --> 04:38.937
If you look at that picture
they have in the paper,

04:38.940 --> 04:40.147
it's his cape.

04:40.150 --> 04:41.183
It's iconic.

04:41.186 --> 04:42.787
Heard Alice's gang firebombed

04:42.790 --> 04:44.265
a Crows truck last night.

04:44.268 --> 04:46.353
Batman picked a good time to come home.

04:46.356 --> 04:47.759
In my search for Alice,

04:47.761 --> 04:49.030
something else happened.

04:49.033 --> 04:51.746
A city divided by walls,
money, and bad luck

04:51.749 --> 04:54.859
rallied around a
single hope, Bruce, you,

04:54.861 --> 04:56.809
except I was too busy to notice.

04:56.812 --> 04:58.866
I don't like their
market response to the AR.

04:58.868 --> 05:02.033
Let's pull out and see if we
can spark interest in Dubai.

05:02.035 --> 05:05.638
Do you see this baby turtle
eating this strawberry?

05:05.641 --> 05:07.843
It's so cute. I want one.

05:07.846 --> 05:10.374
- Morning, everyone.
- Morning.

05:10.376 --> 05:12.682
Heard the Crows killed a
lead on Alice last night.

05:12.685 --> 05:15.671
Maybe if you reconsidered
my offer to join my team,

05:15.673 --> 05:17.173
you could help us with that.

05:17.175 --> 05:19.786
The Crows aren't really a
good fit for me right now.

05:19.789 --> 05:21.719
Because of Sophie? Oh, my God!

05:21.722 --> 05:22.735
Can we talk about the fact that

05:22.737 --> 05:24.512
she's married to a man?

05:24.515 --> 05:26.366
- Let's not.
- I'm not trying to label her

05:26.368 --> 05:28.312
or anything, but
what's her deal exactly?

05:28.315 --> 05:30.518
She's married, honey. Drop it.

05:30.521 --> 05:32.599
Yeah. I get that, but she could still be

05:32.602 --> 05:35.804
bi, bicurious, pan, poly, omni...

05:35.807 --> 05:37.941
I think Alice is Beth.

05:40.219 --> 05:41.269
Whoa.

05:41.272 --> 05:43.852
Heh. Kate, what are you talking about?

05:43.855 --> 05:45.688
That's ridiculous.

05:45.691 --> 05:47.524
I thought they found her body.

05:47.527 --> 05:49.199
They found bone fragments.

05:49.202 --> 05:51.890
Skull fragments matching Beth's DNA.

05:51.893 --> 05:54.218
I was able to get one of Alice's knives.

05:54.220 --> 05:58.139
It has a garnet stone, our birth stone.

05:58.141 --> 05:59.878
If we can test the knife for DNA...

05:59.881 --> 06:01.900
Kate, listen to yourself.

06:01.903 --> 06:04.696
She has a vendetta against you. Why?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.706
Why not kill me when she had the chance,

06:06.709 --> 06:09.257
and why does she seem to
know everything about me?

06:09.260 --> 06:12.395
I know that you want to
believe that Beth is alive.

06:12.397 --> 06:16.547
I do, too, but facts are facts.

06:16.550 --> 06:18.291
Beth's dead.

06:18.294 --> 06:20.937
Katie, Alice kidnapped Sophie.

06:20.940 --> 06:23.537
She drove a bomb into
a park full of families.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.833
She killed two police
officers in cold blood.

06:25.835 --> 06:27.618
How on earth could she be Beth?

06:27.620 --> 06:30.805
Alice is Beth, and I'll prove it to you.

06:33.626 --> 06:37.437
Such a lovely home. So
nice of you to let us stay.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.180
Is the pleasure of making a daisy chain

06:39.182 --> 06:42.007
worth the trouble of getting
up and picking the daisies?

06:42.009 --> 06:44.686
We're all thinking it.
You should give up, Alice.

06:44.688 --> 06:46.429
Simon's dead, Gus is in the wind,

06:46.431 --> 06:48.465
and we're all scampering
about from hole to hole,

06:48.468 --> 06:52.057
trying to avoid getting
snatched up by our tails...

06:54.647 --> 06:57.940
But we're still poor, are we not?

06:57.942 --> 07:01.193
We're still vulnerable, are we not,

07:01.195 --> 07:04.828
and they are still rich and powerful

07:04.831 --> 07:09.209
and protected by the Crows.

07:09.212 --> 07:11.042
Bullies paid for by richer bullies

07:11.045 --> 07:13.046
all with the goal of
sweeping us into the shadows

07:13.049 --> 07:14.099
to be forgotten.

07:14.102 --> 07:16.009
Ha ha ha!

07:16.012 --> 07:21.221
Ohh. Jacob Kane is not man enough

07:21.224 --> 07:22.950
to protect this city

07:22.953 --> 07:24.508
because he's a quitter,

07:24.510 --> 07:29.447
and when things get
difficult, he gives up.

07:30.567 --> 07:33.676
I think it's time for Gotham to watch

07:33.679 --> 07:35.907
Commander Crow squirm.

07:40.693 --> 07:43.083
Tell me you found my favorite knife.

07:43.086 --> 07:44.219
No luck.

07:44.222 --> 07:46.270
What the hell did I do with it?

07:46.273 --> 07:48.842
It is so much more fun
unveiling my evil plan

07:48.844 --> 07:50.659
when I can flip it about for cadence.

07:50.661 --> 07:53.496
And how does Kate Kane
fit into that evil plan?

07:53.499 --> 08:00.581
Now you are so cute when you're jealous.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.716
I want to make sure we stay on point...

08:05.718 --> 08:08.482
uproot the city's
confidence in the Crows,

08:08.485 --> 08:11.102
let chaos reign.

08:12.691 --> 08:16.158
It's so boring when he says it.

08:16.161 --> 08:17.905
You're making this personal, Alice.

08:17.908 --> 08:20.474
It is personal!

08:20.477 --> 08:23.370
My father gave up on me,

08:23.373 --> 08:25.381
and I want to make him suffer

08:25.384 --> 08:26.778
the way that I did

08:26.781 --> 08:29.204
by stripping away everything

08:29.207 --> 08:32.058
that he cares about

08:32.061 --> 08:35.236
until he's all alone.

08:37.578 --> 08:40.587
Where is my damn knife?!

08:49.404 --> 08:51.759
Mom, Beth!

08:51.762 --> 08:53.487
Beth!

08:57.513 --> 09:00.198
Hey, kiddo. You're okay.

09:00.201 --> 09:03.852
I'm right here. Oh.

09:03.855 --> 09:07.541
Ahh. Same one?

09:12.577 --> 09:16.095
You, uh... you know, you have a bed.

09:16.097 --> 09:19.516
I need to stay out
here in case she calls.

09:20.443 --> 09:22.001
Ahh.

09:29.914 --> 09:31.872
Dad?

09:31.875 --> 09:35.877
Do you promise we'll
never stop looking for her?

09:35.880 --> 09:37.731
I promise.

09:50.707 --> 09:52.448
Got your text. Uh, yes, technically,

09:52.450 --> 09:55.635
Wayne is in possession of a
thermal cycler and PCR mixers.

09:55.637 --> 09:57.328
- PCR?
- Polymerase Chain Reaction.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.816
It's used to separate and amplify DNA,

09:59.819 --> 10:02.660
which then needs to be analyzed
against another sample for a match.

10:02.663 --> 10:04.876
So if I could provide
you with another sample?

10:04.879 --> 10:07.480
Sorry. I just keep the doors
locked and the lights on.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.798
For Bruce Wayne, who isn't here.

10:09.800 --> 10:12.949
Currently but not ultimately,
which is why we need

10:12.952 --> 10:14.643
to talk about his suit.

10:14.646 --> 10:16.013
Are you watching the news?

10:16.016 --> 10:18.324
The city is clamoring for
a hero that isn't here,

10:18.326 --> 10:20.827
and I know you don't want to
be the city's next great hope,

10:20.829 --> 10:25.498
but it's too late because
they think you're him.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.808
I need that suit to stop Alice.

10:27.811 --> 10:29.828
My cousin figured it out years ago.

10:29.831 --> 10:32.216
Be more terrifying than your enemy.

10:34.897 --> 10:36.250
Do you know what this is?

10:36.253 --> 10:38.402
A... Bat... weapon.

10:38.405 --> 10:42.060
Laser saw. This thing
will cut through anything.

10:42.063 --> 10:44.063
Cool.

10:44.066 --> 10:45.388
What about this?

10:45.391 --> 10:47.020
- Gas mask?
- Rebreather

10:47.022 --> 10:49.248
to breathe underwater without a tank.

10:49.251 --> 10:51.214
See, these aren't toys.

10:51.217 --> 10:53.050
These are one-of-a-kind, dangerous tools

10:53.052 --> 10:55.085
which even I don't know how to use.

10:55.088 --> 10:57.012
I don't how to use
half the stuff in here

10:57.014 --> 10:58.865
because it's not meant for me.

10:58.867 --> 11:01.027
It's meant for Batman.

11:01.030 --> 11:03.852
- You know who you sound like?
- I'm sure you'll tell me.

11:03.854 --> 11:05.580
Lucius Fox.

11:05.582 --> 11:08.899
Trust me. I am a far cry from my father.

11:08.902 --> 11:12.201
Oh, I know. He was actually useful.

11:13.890 --> 11:15.740
That's funny.

11:23.132 --> 11:25.892
"Define the goal, define the objective,

11:25.894 --> 11:28.919
define the terms of victory."

11:28.921 --> 11:30.870
Your dad made those for the office.

11:30.873 --> 11:33.758
Now imagine him teaching
you how to play tee-ball.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.411
Is this you?

11:51.086 --> 11:53.494
What? This... this dude in the picture?

11:53.496 --> 11:55.672
The person in this
picture dressed as Batman

11:55.674 --> 11:57.239
who saved my life the other night.

11:57.241 --> 11:59.110
- Was that you?
- Anyone who knows me knows

11:59.113 --> 12:00.153
I hate Batman.

12:00.156 --> 12:02.152
So does your dad, which would make

12:02.155 --> 12:05.775
putting on this suit an
incredibly reckless move.

12:05.778 --> 12:08.369
Wasn't me. Besides,

12:08.372 --> 12:11.795
if I were gonna save you
in a dramatic fashion,

12:11.797 --> 12:14.899
I would totally dress as Wonder Woman.

12:19.305 --> 12:21.202
Can we go somewhere private?

12:23.142 --> 12:25.702
I need you to run that for DNA.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.478
Alice tried to kill me.

12:27.480 --> 12:32.015
She put me on a plank 20 stories
in the air and watched it drop.

12:32.018 --> 12:33.314
She's sick.

12:33.317 --> 12:35.558
She's a monster, Kate.

12:35.561 --> 12:37.130
She's not your twin.

12:37.132 --> 12:39.126
If I can get her DNA off the knife,

12:39.129 --> 12:41.421
I can compare it with my own.

12:41.424 --> 12:45.661
Look. I know why you
want Beth to be alive,

12:45.664 --> 12:48.957
but aren't you getting
your hopes up over nothing?

12:48.960 --> 12:51.965
Maybe... but you know me and hope.

12:56.317 --> 12:59.583
Your dad would kill me. I can't.

13:05.994 --> 13:11.906
You know, if... if I'd known
you were getting married,

13:11.908 --> 13:15.192
I would have come back sooner.

13:15.194 --> 13:17.911
I didn't think weddings were your thing.

13:17.914 --> 13:22.331
Not to go. To stop it.

13:31.246 --> 13:32.570
Thanks.

13:32.573 --> 13:34.632
Yeah.

13:37.266 --> 13:39.475
You've got something of Alice's.

13:39.478 --> 13:41.184
Ohh!

13:43.521 --> 13:45.140
Ohh!

14:02.592 --> 14:04.792
Got it, got it! Go, go, go!

14:17.290 --> 14:20.007
I'm sorry I dragged you into this.

14:20.009 --> 14:23.046
Are you, though?

14:23.049 --> 14:25.225
Not really.

14:25.228 --> 14:28.039
This is exactly what
I was worried about.

14:28.042 --> 14:30.039
You put yourself directly
in Alice's crosshairs,

14:30.042 --> 14:31.652
and you brought her
right to our doorstep.

14:31.654 --> 14:33.216
How the hell did she
even know I had her knife?

14:33.218 --> 14:36.362
Are you hearing yourself? Talk
some sense into her, please.

14:36.365 --> 14:39.109
All due respect, sir,
I don't see any harm

14:39.111 --> 14:41.414
in running a DNA test on
Alice if we can catch her.

14:41.417 --> 14:42.901
My daughter died.

14:42.904 --> 14:44.798
I have the lab results that prove it.

14:44.801 --> 14:47.242
Alice... that thing... Is a cop killer

14:47.244 --> 14:49.287
who drove enough C4 into Robinson Park

14:49.290 --> 14:50.771
to level a square block.

14:50.774 --> 14:53.623
I am not saying Alice is a good person.

14:53.626 --> 14:56.442
All I'm saying it has been 15 years.

14:56.445 --> 15:00.014
We don't know what happened to her.

15:00.016 --> 15:02.629
What if somewhere
deep down inside of her

15:02.632 --> 15:05.841
she is actually Beth?

15:05.844 --> 15:10.322
The GCPD just gave us the
green light to put her down.

15:10.325 --> 15:12.278
I'm not wasting the shot.

15:12.281 --> 15:13.430
Excuse me, sir.

15:13.433 --> 15:16.025
Update on missing
rabbit from last night.

15:16.028 --> 15:17.611
Traced him into Tricorner,

15:17.614 --> 15:19.165
found a blood trail, then it disappears

15:19.167 --> 15:21.450
somewhere around Bennett Ave.

15:21.453 --> 15:23.671
Bennett Ave.

15:29.003 --> 15:30.327
What are you doing here?

15:30.329 --> 15:32.300
Is there a password or something?

15:32.303 --> 15:33.978
Get in here.

15:34.970 --> 15:37.520
It goes without saying,
but this clinic breaks

15:37.523 --> 15:39.035
no less than 10 laws an hour,

15:39.038 --> 15:41.609
and considering that
your dad runs the Crows...

15:41.612 --> 15:43.279
- Not planning to tell him.
- Good because it's

15:43.281 --> 15:45.090
hard enough balancing
this with med school,

15:45.093 --> 15:47.895
and I can't exactly protest
Gotham's failing healthcare system

15:47.897 --> 15:49.513
from the inside of a prison cell.

15:49.515 --> 15:53.497
What's your stance on
doctor-patient confidentiality?

15:53.500 --> 15:55.641
Hmm.

15:55.644 --> 15:59.164
Came in this morning,
bleeding pretty bad.

15:59.167 --> 16:01.629
Won't say anything. Not unusual,

16:01.632 --> 16:05.668
but then look at what I
pulled out of his scapula.

16:05.671 --> 16:07.730
Ha! He's a Batman victim.

16:07.733 --> 16:11.342
I'm so keeping this, FYI.

16:11.345 --> 16:13.679
He's one of Alice's guys.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.847
- I saw it on the news.
- Good to know.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.996
Actually, I'm really
glad that you're here.

16:17.999 --> 16:21.136
I was thinking that we haven't
really had any sister time

16:21.138 --> 16:22.314
since you've been back,

16:22.317 --> 16:25.044
and I was just reading about
this brand-new plant-based cafe

16:25.047 --> 16:28.861
that is so organic your fork
literally dissolves in your hand

16:28.863 --> 16:30.271
if you don't eat fast enough.

16:30.273 --> 16:32.093
- Sounds good.
- Oh, cool.

16:32.096 --> 16:34.636
Okay. So see you back here at 7:00.

16:34.639 --> 16:35.771
Whoa!

16:35.774 --> 16:37.688
Not sure that that's
a good idea considering

16:37.691 --> 16:39.098
he's a domestic terrorist.

16:39.101 --> 16:43.195
I need you to send a message
to Alice from Kate Kane.

16:44.829 --> 16:46.453
Waffles.

16:46.455 --> 16:49.939
- Now get out of here.
- Ugh.

16:49.942 --> 16:51.289
Waffles?

16:51.292 --> 16:53.400
If Alice is Beth, she'll
know what it means.

16:53.403 --> 16:54.670
What does it mean?

16:54.673 --> 16:56.636
It's better if you don't know.

16:59.996 --> 17:01.972
See you at 7:00.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.133
Surveillance narrows them
to the Kubert district.

17:08.135 --> 17:11.720
Caught Dodgson in
an alley about 3 hours ago.

17:11.722 --> 17:14.598
The rabbit we shot last night
was seen at a C Store earlier

17:14.599 --> 17:16.107
just a few blocks away.

17:16.109 --> 17:17.512
Must be hovering around there.

17:17.516 --> 17:20.269
In a suburban, white
picket fence neighborhood?

17:20.271 --> 17:25.133
Not really the M.O. of a
gang who hides in the shadows.

17:25.136 --> 17:27.068
I know where they are.

17:27.070 --> 17:31.624
Get every available man
to 1472 Norman Drive now.

17:31.627 --> 17:32.984
Sir?

17:32.987 --> 17:35.613
We're wasting time.

17:41.844 --> 17:43.327
Hey. I can't really talk.

17:43.329 --> 17:45.230
Then just say yes. I need
you to buy me some time

17:45.232 --> 17:46.231
while I find Alice.

17:46.234 --> 17:47.275
Kate, it's too late.

17:47.278 --> 17:48.953
I just need you to stall the Crows

17:48.956 --> 17:50.430
for a couple of hours.

17:50.433 --> 17:52.842
Kate, I'm not helping you
if I don't know what you did.

17:52.845 --> 17:53.969
I got her a message.

17:53.972 --> 17:55.729
I asked her to meet
at our favorite place,

17:55.732 --> 17:59.099
and if she's really Beth,
she'll know what it means.

17:59.102 --> 18:01.719
The waffle stand.

18:01.722 --> 18:02.896
You remembered.

18:02.899 --> 18:04.643
You know how dangerous she is.

18:04.646 --> 18:06.166
Don't do this.

18:06.169 --> 18:09.425
My dad is going to
kill my sister, Sophie.

18:11.407 --> 18:14.133
Please just... buy me some time

18:14.135 --> 18:16.886
so I can prove him wrong.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.322
Oh, come on.

18:33.740 --> 18:36.758
No. Hey, hey. Why are you doing that?

18:36.761 --> 18:38.511
Uh...

18:42.047 --> 18:43.740
Whoa, whoa. What are you doing, Luke?

18:43.743 --> 18:45.743
It's not a toy.

18:45.746 --> 18:47.287
Stop.

18:49.663 --> 18:51.598
Oh, please just...

18:53.079 --> 18:55.663
Whoa. I did not mean to...

19:01.313 --> 19:02.904
Okay.

19:48.253 --> 19:52.386
What, you don't like
chocolate all of a sudden, huh?

19:52.389 --> 19:53.981
I'm not hungry.

19:53.984 --> 19:56.592
Come on. You're the world record holder

19:56.595 --> 19:59.313
for fastest waffle consumption.

19:59.315 --> 20:02.032
- Title's in jeopardy.
- We shouldn't be eating.

20:02.034 --> 20:04.292
We should be looking for Beth.

20:04.295 --> 20:08.464
Ahh. Been looking for months.

20:08.467 --> 20:11.802
We deserve a sugar break.

20:11.805 --> 20:14.198
It was my fault.

20:14.201 --> 20:16.829
Hey. Hey.

20:16.832 --> 20:19.925
Why would you say that, huh?

20:19.927 --> 20:21.451
You weren't there, Dad.

20:21.453 --> 20:23.429
After we crashed, Beth went to check

20:23.431 --> 20:24.763
on Mom in the front seat.

20:24.765 --> 20:28.920
Instead of helping, I climbed out.

20:28.923 --> 20:31.694
I left her.

20:31.697 --> 20:34.340
You... you were being safe.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.674
But I could have grabbed her,

20:39.677 --> 20:43.007
but I was too scared if
my feet left the ground

20:43.010 --> 20:44.841
I'd go over, too.

20:44.844 --> 20:47.978
I should have just climbed
on the car and grabbed her.

20:47.980 --> 20:52.791
She was my sister. Why
didn't I try a little harder?

20:52.793 --> 20:55.863
Come here... come here.

20:55.866 --> 20:57.949
You're okay.

21:09.443 --> 21:11.258
Oh, my God!

21:17.489 --> 21:19.740
They're gone, sir.

21:19.743 --> 21:22.564
TV dinner still in the microwave.

21:22.567 --> 21:24.066
Damn it.

21:24.069 --> 21:27.154
How did you know she was here?

21:27.157 --> 21:29.741
Beth grew up here.

21:29.744 --> 21:31.502
This was our old house.

21:31.505 --> 21:34.356
Sir... you don't think...

21:34.359 --> 21:37.169
Of course not. She's
trying to get in my head.

21:37.171 --> 21:39.296
It's not gonna work.

21:52.336 --> 21:55.512
Well, look who finally figured it out.

22:08.663 --> 22:10.379
Are you my sister?

22:10.382 --> 22:13.546
Mmm. Who in the world am I?

22:13.549 --> 22:16.708
Now that is the great puzzle, isn't it?

22:16.711 --> 22:20.187
Did you know I was gonna have
your knife tested for DNA?

22:23.367 --> 22:26.552
You had my knife? Ha ha!

22:26.554 --> 22:28.554
And here I've been going around using

22:28.556 --> 22:32.082
this charmless contraption.

22:32.084 --> 22:33.844
You didn't have your guys jump me.

22:33.847 --> 22:38.379
Jump you? Kate, we're sisters.

22:38.382 --> 22:42.164
Prove it. Let me test your
DNA before the Crows kill you.

22:42.167 --> 22:44.292
I already proved it.

22:44.295 --> 22:45.753
I'm here.

22:45.756 --> 22:49.108
I knew the password, "Waffles,"

22:49.111 --> 22:51.076
our favorite spot.

22:51.079 --> 22:54.269
We used to come here
after school on Fridays

22:54.272 --> 22:58.721
and gorge our faces in
chocolate-covered garbage.

22:58.724 --> 23:01.392
How else would I know that...

23:02.785 --> 23:05.102
Unless...

23:05.105 --> 23:06.938
Oh, dear.

23:06.941 --> 23:09.199
Did the press mention that you and Beth

23:09.202 --> 23:12.137
used to come here as part of
your silly, little tradition,

23:12.140 --> 23:15.707
and did I read an old article...

23:15.710 --> 23:17.478
online?

23:34.270 --> 23:36.603
- Sir.
- We're going to Tricorner.

23:36.606 --> 23:38.557
They just left. Can't be too far.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.077
Sir, she's not in Tricorner.

23:40.080 --> 23:41.854
I want checkpoints on all the bridges.

23:41.857 --> 23:44.473
Sir...

23:44.476 --> 23:47.713
I know where she is.

23:47.716 --> 23:49.641
They found skull fragments.

23:49.644 --> 23:50.735
They declared you dead.

23:50.738 --> 23:52.262
Then why are you still here?

23:52.265 --> 23:53.556
If I were really your twin,

23:53.559 --> 23:55.814
wouldn't you feel something?

24:00.980 --> 24:03.131
How did you survive the crash?

24:03.133 --> 24:08.562
Crash? The crash? Oh, yes, the crash.

24:08.564 --> 24:10.585
Hmm. Let's see. We hit the water

24:10.588 --> 24:12.680
with a dramatic splash,
and when I opened my eyes,

24:12.683 --> 24:15.275
my mother's head was on the
other side of the windshield.

24:15.278 --> 24:18.497
A surreal sight, a motherless head.

24:18.500 --> 24:22.317
Poor Gabi, or was it Abby?

24:22.320 --> 24:24.286
Nevertheless, it was cold.

24:24.288 --> 24:26.488
Have you ever had a
tea party on the inside

24:26.490 --> 24:27.673
of a block of ice?

24:27.675 --> 24:28.959
It's much akin to that.

24:28.962 --> 24:31.671
Water rushed through every
seam of the car up to my knees

24:31.674 --> 24:32.999
and then to my neck.

24:33.002 --> 24:34.985
Ha! I didn't know
whether to hold my breath

24:34.988 --> 24:36.379
or to scream,

24:36.382 --> 24:40.234
but as I tilted my head
like a little mouse,

24:40.237 --> 24:43.187
sucking in the increasingly shrinking

24:43.190 --> 24:44.665
bubble of air,

24:44.668 --> 24:47.711
one thought kept me calm.

24:49.020 --> 24:54.703
"Surely someone will come and save me."

24:58.873 --> 25:01.081
Feel free to get that.

25:05.661 --> 25:06.819
Ahem.

25:06.822 --> 25:08.475
_

25:08.478 --> 25:09.665
What's wrong?

25:09.668 --> 25:12.458
No interest in painting your nails,

25:12.461 --> 25:15.220
gossiping about boys?

25:15.222 --> 25:16.615
We have a lot to catch up on.

25:16.618 --> 25:18.456
Heh. I'd rather not.

25:18.459 --> 25:23.937
I came here tonight to ask
you one simple question.

25:23.940 --> 25:26.224
After I disappeared,

25:26.227 --> 25:28.349
when did you sleep through the night

25:28.352 --> 25:31.236
for the very first time?

25:33.010 --> 25:34.338
I haven't yet.

25:34.341 --> 25:36.883
Heh. Sure you have.

25:37.967 --> 25:39.684
I never moved on.

25:39.687 --> 25:41.279
Why is that?

25:41.282 --> 25:44.641
Because I never gave up
hope that I would find you.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.661
And why is that?

25:49.246 --> 25:51.523
Because I should have been with you.

26:00.100 --> 26:04.603
Here's my DNA, dear.
Go prove it to Daddy.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.405
Target green. I have a clear shot.

26:07.408 --> 26:09.877
- Tattletale.
- What?

26:19.617 --> 26:21.071
Get out of the way, Kate.

26:21.074 --> 26:22.898
Tell your men to stand down.

26:22.901 --> 26:24.342
Kate, she's in your head.

26:24.345 --> 26:26.203
Then arrest her and get her help.

26:26.206 --> 26:27.854
She's got a knife.

26:27.857 --> 26:29.502
Drop it, or they will shoot you

26:29.505 --> 26:31.864
- and call it self-defense.
- Not if you stay put.

26:31.867 --> 26:35.651
Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

26:37.379 --> 26:38.879
She's your daughter,

26:38.881 --> 26:41.540
and if you kill her,
you won't just lose Beth.

26:41.543 --> 26:44.020
You'll lose me, too.

26:49.102 --> 26:50.818
Take her to Arkham.

27:06.275 --> 27:08.341
Kate.

27:08.344 --> 27:10.093
Kate, hang on.

27:10.096 --> 27:13.448
And here I thought you
could keep a secret.

27:17.845 --> 27:21.013
I didn't tell them you'd be here.

27:21.015 --> 27:23.665
"Tell us a story," said the march hare.

27:23.667 --> 27:26.476
"Yes, please do," pled Alice,

27:26.478 --> 27:28.138
and so the dormouse began

27:28.141 --> 27:33.615
"Once upon a time, there
were 3 little sisters."

27:33.618 --> 27:35.043
What did you do?

27:35.046 --> 27:36.412
You don't remember why
we'd each have to get

27:36.414 --> 27:39.766
our own waffle when we came here?

27:39.769 --> 27:41.848
Because you don't like to share.

27:41.851 --> 27:46.263
Exactly, and you are my sister, Kate!

27:46.266 --> 27:48.099
- No.
- Ha ha ha!

27:50.560 --> 27:52.406
Hey. So not to rush you,

27:52.409 --> 27:54.057
but I made 7:00 ressies,

27:54.060 --> 27:56.622
and it's 7:45,

27:56.625 --> 27:59.279
and I had to call in a favor for these,

27:59.282 --> 28:01.800
so, yeah, okay.

28:01.803 --> 28:04.179
Call me. Bye.

28:09.085 --> 28:10.960
Wonderful.

28:26.580 --> 28:28.896
Oh, my God! What are you doing?

28:28.898 --> 28:31.416
Alice doesn't like competition.

28:31.418 --> 28:32.734
Ohh!

28:32.736 --> 28:34.336
Aah!

28:38.463 --> 28:39.888
Aah!

28:44.691 --> 28:46.691
Agh!

28:46.694 --> 28:47.869
Aah!

28:47.872 --> 28:49.705
Psycho!

28:54.609 --> 28:56.084
Agh!

29:04.511 --> 29:06.186
All right.

29:12.418 --> 29:14.144
Here we go.

29:20.531 --> 29:23.106
Aah!

29:23.223 --> 29:26.328
Aah!

29:30.362 --> 29:32.236
Agh!

29:44.825 --> 29:48.155
Plus, find out just how official history

29:48.158 --> 29:49.532
will affect his future.

29:49.535 --> 29:52.071
And we have an update on the ongoing

29:52.074 --> 29:53.406
Wonderland Gang story.

29:53.408 --> 29:55.834
Let's go to our eye in
the sky reporter for more

29:55.836 --> 29:57.836
This is News 8 Gotham in the sky

29:57.838 --> 29:59.062
with breaking news.

29:59.064 --> 30:01.483
Is the city's nightmare finally over?

30:01.486 --> 30:04.780
Alice, the leader of the
Wonderland Gang, has been captured.

30:04.783 --> 30:07.087
The Crows apprehended
the notorious killer

30:07.089 --> 30:08.830
minutes ago in Burnside Park.

30:08.832 --> 30:10.365
Now as you can see, we're live.

30:10.368 --> 30:12.116
We're following the prison transport

30:12.119 --> 30:13.450
to Arkham, where wait!

30:13.453 --> 30:16.062
What... what just happened?

30:16.065 --> 30:17.995
The van has exploded.

30:38.824 --> 30:41.232
Uh, Kate, can you hear me?

30:41.235 --> 30:42.703
Uh, Batcave to Kate.

30:42.706 --> 30:45.220
- You're still 5 minutes out.
- I can make it.

30:45.223 --> 30:48.296
Tell me you realize that
place is crawling with cops.

30:52.085 --> 30:53.632
Go, go, go!

30:53.635 --> 30:56.010
If you see her, shoot!

30:56.012 --> 30:58.482
Maybe it was fate watching her

30:58.485 --> 31:02.623
drown in a river the way everyone
assumed she had years ago,

31:02.626 --> 31:04.530
and maybe I was meant to stand by

31:04.533 --> 31:06.737
and watch it all happen all over again.

31:08.391 --> 31:10.892
After all, my dad was right.

31:10.894 --> 31:12.410
Alice was a monster.

31:12.412 --> 31:16.565
She was a liar, a manipulator, a killer,

31:16.568 --> 31:18.266
but despite all that...

31:19.462 --> 31:21.818
She was still my sister.

31:23.457 --> 31:25.016
Grab my hand!

31:25.106 --> 31:26.957
Grab my hand!

32:04.735 --> 32:09.589
Hey. Batcave to Kate. Batcave to Kate.

32:19.429 --> 32:22.638
Kate, are you okay?

32:22.641 --> 32:24.725
Batcave to Kate.

32:24.728 --> 32:26.782
Wake up, Kate.

32:26.785 --> 32:28.453
Whoever's down here.

32:30.306 --> 32:32.240
Hey. Batcave to Kate.
You got a lot of cops

32:32.242 --> 32:33.909
coming towards you right now.

32:35.127 --> 32:37.771
You need to get up now. Kate!

32:40.149 --> 32:43.576
I know there's a
defibrillator on the suit.

33:02.654 --> 33:05.430
Okay, people. Time to get real.

33:05.433 --> 33:08.578
Massive explosion on the
Loeb Bridge last night.

33:08.581 --> 33:10.605
The leader of the
Alice in Wonderland Gang

33:10.608 --> 33:14.450
is in the wind, and
Batman was not there.

33:14.453 --> 33:17.270
Was there a cowl convention
we didn't know about?

33:17.273 --> 33:19.041
Was it Robin's high school graduation?

33:19.044 --> 33:23.137
Talk to me, Gotham. Did
we put our hope in a ghost?

33:29.407 --> 33:32.576
I just came to apologize
for missing dinner,

33:32.579 --> 33:34.680
but apparently, I missed...

33:34.683 --> 33:37.493
Something else.

33:37.496 --> 33:39.320
Sorry.

33:42.137 --> 33:48.090
So. Okay. Look. I get the
whole needing to know with Alice

33:48.092 --> 33:53.071
because she's your sister,
and... duh... sisters...

33:54.098 --> 33:56.359
But her boyfriend tried
to kill me last night

33:56.362 --> 34:00.653
because apparently she
sees me as her replacement,

34:00.655 --> 34:04.157
which under normal circumstances could,

34:04.159 --> 34:07.902
you know, maybe be borderline flattering

34:07.904 --> 34:10.255
except here it's just ironic

34:10.257 --> 34:12.472
considering the most sisterly thing that

34:12.475 --> 34:15.864
you've ever done is pretty
much act like I don't exist.

34:15.868 --> 34:18.553
Mary, it's not like that.

34:19.717 --> 34:22.248
Don't worry. You know,

34:22.251 --> 34:27.105
he took off and got scared
before doing any permanent damage,

34:27.107 --> 34:29.297
and, no, I didn't tell your dad.

34:29.300 --> 34:34.442
The last thing I need is my
own personal security detail.

34:34.445 --> 34:38.530
Mary, I am so sorry.

34:38.533 --> 34:40.592
Is Alice worth it?

34:44.866 --> 34:48.150
Because if she is,
could you just tell her

34:48.152 --> 34:52.464
that I'm not a threat, please?

34:58.740 --> 35:01.294
How the hell did someone get a bomb

35:01.297 --> 35:02.455
on that bridge?

35:02.458 --> 35:04.216
There is something else going on here,

35:04.219 --> 35:05.977
and between the Crows and the GCPD,

35:05.979 --> 35:07.732
it needs to start making sense.

35:07.735 --> 35:09.651
Get out!

35:14.837 --> 35:16.253
I take it I'm next.

35:16.256 --> 35:17.846
That stunt you pulled,

35:17.849 --> 35:19.720
it's called aiding and abetting.

35:19.723 --> 35:20.672
You crossed the line.

35:20.675 --> 35:24.226
And you're about to
kill your own daughter.

35:24.229 --> 35:27.272
Now you tell me again
how my daughter did this.

35:27.275 --> 35:29.501
She went into the
house where you grew up,

35:29.503 --> 35:31.193
she murdered the current owners

35:31.195 --> 35:32.652
by slitting open their throats.

35:32.655 --> 35:35.406
She's not Beth, Kate. Drop it now,

35:35.408 --> 35:37.566
or I'll have you arrested myself.

36:52.290 --> 36:53.497
Dad?

36:53.500 --> 36:58.395
Oh. Uh... hey, kiddo.

37:00.248 --> 37:02.059
Come here.

37:06.497 --> 37:08.456
Uh...

37:08.459 --> 37:14.504
Catherine Hamilton's
investigators found bones

37:14.507 --> 37:17.726
on Miller Farm.

37:17.729 --> 37:19.425
- No.
- Skull fragments

37:19.428 --> 37:21.826
of a little girl.

37:21.829 --> 37:24.830
They, um...

37:24.833 --> 37:26.679
They had them tested,

37:26.682 --> 37:30.350
and it's her, Kate.

37:30.353 --> 37:31.720
It's Beth.

37:31.723 --> 37:36.484
No, Dad. I checked Miller
Farm a million times!

37:36.487 --> 37:38.862
Kate, they found her.

37:41.934 --> 37:43.992
See? There's nothing there, Dad.

37:43.995 --> 37:45.995
I would have seen it. I looked!

37:45.997 --> 37:47.621
It's time to say good-bye, Kate.

37:47.623 --> 37:49.456
You said you'd never give up!

37:49.458 --> 37:51.768
- Kate.
- You're a traitor!

37:51.771 --> 37:53.571
Kate.

38:01.512 --> 38:04.823
She could have killed you.

38:04.826 --> 38:07.636
You totally sold me out.

38:07.639 --> 38:09.309
It's called caring about you.

38:09.312 --> 38:10.368
If you cared, you wouldn't have lied

38:10.370 --> 38:13.496
to an entire military academy about me.

38:13.499 --> 38:15.299
That's not fair, Kate.

38:15.302 --> 38:16.676
So you didn't lie?

38:16.679 --> 38:18.838
I would never lie to you.

38:18.841 --> 38:21.233
I won't ever lie to you.

38:22.447 --> 38:25.665
Are you happy?

38:25.668 --> 38:28.285
Yes.

38:28.288 --> 38:30.222
Yes or ish?

38:32.851 --> 38:34.926
I'm happy, Kate,

38:34.929 --> 38:36.846
and...

38:40.487 --> 38:45.573
There is no us, okay?

38:45.576 --> 38:48.211
You need to move on.

39:02.477 --> 39:04.185
Did you get the suit wet?

39:04.188 --> 39:06.801
Okay. So I couldn't find
the autodry function.

39:06.804 --> 39:08.544
Yeah, because that's not a thing.

39:08.546 --> 39:11.633
$10.8 million suit. Kind
of feels like an oversight.

39:11.636 --> 39:13.853
Just saying.

39:13.856 --> 39:18.475
Hey. Thank you for bailing me out.

39:18.478 --> 39:20.386
Yeah. I mean, I found the comms,

39:20.389 --> 39:22.930
and I saw you hadn't moved in a while,

39:22.933 --> 39:24.476
and I figured maybe...

39:24.479 --> 39:27.410
- Let's not get misty-eyed.
- Yep. No problem.

39:27.413 --> 39:29.388
No problem.

39:31.602 --> 39:33.185
Alice said her thugs didn't jump me,

39:33.188 --> 39:35.092
which means there is someone else

39:35.095 --> 39:37.963
who doesn't want me knowing the
truth about the DNA on the knife.

39:37.966 --> 39:40.187
Yeah. Well, just so you know,

39:40.190 --> 39:41.782
while you're figuring that out,

39:41.785 --> 39:45.128
you're getting a whole lot of
people excited over nothing.

39:57.093 --> 39:59.069
Get rid of it.

40:00.774 --> 40:02.923
It'll be melted it into a paperweight.

40:02.925 --> 40:04.798
Destroy the masks while you're at it.

40:04.801 --> 40:07.795
I'll take care of whatever
surveillance was in the garage.

40:07.798 --> 40:09.581
Like it never happened.

40:16.814 --> 40:18.614
Luke was right, Bruce.

40:18.616 --> 40:20.615
Gotham needed something to believe in.

40:20.618 --> 40:23.474
They wanted hope just as
I started to lose mine.

40:23.477 --> 40:27.030
I spent half my life
looking for my sister,

40:27.032 --> 40:29.491
and today, I found someone else,

40:29.493 --> 40:32.327
someone I didn't know or recognize.

40:32.329 --> 40:34.972
For the first time in 15 years,

40:34.974 --> 40:37.175
I felt something other than hope.

40:37.178 --> 40:39.029
I felt doubt.

40:48.488 --> 40:52.819
You're gonna tell me
everything you know about Alice.

40:52.822 --> 40:55.210
Thought you were Batman.

40:55.213 --> 40:56.972
You wish.

40:58.287 --> 40:59.795
Unh!

41:02.026 --> 41:04.318
It may have taken you years,

41:04.320 --> 41:08.615
sweet, darling Kate, but
you found me eventually...

41:11.094 --> 41:15.537
Even if I'm not the girl
you expected me to be.

41:15.539 --> 41:21.710
I had my secrets just as you have yours,

41:21.712 --> 41:25.506
but do be careful, my dear sister.

41:25.508 --> 41:28.682
Putting on that suit
and all the darkness

41:28.685 --> 41:31.833
that comes with it...

41:31.836 --> 41:37.095
Makes you just as crazy as me.

41:37.098 --> 41:40.700
