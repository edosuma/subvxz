-Possibly?

things that were heavy.

-Mm.

-BOB: Uh... no.
-GENE: Hmph.

01:37.339 --> 01:39.080
When it worked,
it had AM and FM,

01:39.100 --> 01:40.006
and, uh, this one had shortwave.

01:40.159 --> 01:41.416
Which is really cool.

You can listen to broadcasts

01:50.444 --> 01:52.927

there was a story

01:52.947 --> 01:54.262
and the radio was in it?

01:54.281 --> 01:55.839
I kind of remember it.

It's about your grandmother
helping a soldier

No, uh, I-I think that's
<i> The English Patient.</i>

02:01.605 --> 02:03.438
I remember the story
about great-grandma.

02:03.532 --> 02:04.865
There was something
about a spy, right?

02:04.959 --> 02:06.683
Wait, we have a family story
with a spy in it?

02:06.702 --> 02:08.127
Why don't I know this?

02:08.278 --> 02:09.353
I guess it's been a while
since I've told it.

02:09.446 --> 02:10.796
You might've been pretty little.

02:10.947 --> 02:12.297
Do you guys want
me to tell it again?

02:12.449 --> 02:13.298
-Yeah.
-Yes.
-No, I don't want to hear

02:13.450 --> 02:15.025
about our family spy story.

02:15.043 --> 02:16.301
Yes, tell it again!

02:16.453 --> 02:18.545
I mean, we were cleaning
the closet, but go ahead.

02:18.714 --> 02:22.307
Okay, so, it was the summer
in 1941 during World War II...

02:22.459 --> 02:24.534

losing their faces

I mean, he was a soldier.
Fighting in the war.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.334
I guess that's a decent excuse.

02:49.486 --> 02:51.003
<i> -BOB: Lily was about</i>
<i> six months old...</i>
-(shushing)

02:51.230 --> 02:53.563

<i> except for the static</i>

Yes. Thanks, Ma, that's helpful.

03:20.034 --> 03:22.275
Hey, I would love it
if we could leave the radio

03:22.369 --> 03:24.594
on the shortwave static
that Lily likes? Please?

03:24.613 --> 03:27.706
Sure, but the problem is that
I like to listen to music

03:27.933 --> 03:29.766
and people talking
during the day

03:29.785 --> 03:31.935
and my programs aren't on
the crying baby static channel.

03:32.104 --> 03:34.438
Well, I'd move the radio
into her room,

03:34.531 --> 03:36.289
but who can move this thing?
You know?

03:36.383 --> 03:37.457
Somebody moved it.

03:37.551 --> 03:38.700
They didn't build
the building around it.

03:38.719 --> 03:39.718
(pigeons fluttering)

<i> of a shoe print</i>

07:14.417 --> 07:16.009
<i> in the pigeon poop</i>
<i> right near the coop.</i>

07:16.085 --> 07:17.327
-(gasps)
<i> -LINDA: Ooh, a poop print.</i>

07:17.420 --> 07:18.678
<i> TINA:</i>
<i> A poop clue.</i>

07:18.830 --> 07:19.996
<i> GENE:</i>
<i> I've left those before.</i>

07:20.089 --> 07:21.589
<i> BOB: Alice went</i>
<i> back downstairs,</i>

07:21.667 --> 07:23.608
<i> wondering which one of</i>
<i>her neighbors could be the spy.</i>

07:23.760 --> 07:26.445
<i> -GENE: Mort!</i>
<i>-BOB: Gene, Mort's our neighbor</i>
<i> and he's not a spy.</i>

07:26.672 --> 07:28.596
<i> GENE: That's what</i>
<i> he wants you to think.</i>

07:28.674 --> 07:29.948
<i> BOB: Okay. On her way</i>
<i> back to her apartment,</i>

07:30.099 --> 07:32.342
-(gasps)
<i> -...she ran into</i>
<i> her neighbor Peter</i>

07:32.435 --> 07:33.693
<i> who works at the shipyard.</i>

07:33.787 --> 07:35.120
<i> And he seemed kind of nervous.</i>

07:35.347 --> 07:37.363
Uh, Alice.
Uh, so sorry to startle you.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.182
What, were you...
up on the roof?

07:39.201 --> 07:42.869
Uh, yeah?
Were you... up on the roof?

07:42.963 --> 07:44.278
What? N-No.

07:44.298 --> 07:46.022
(strained laughter) I'm joking.

07:46.041 --> 07:49.025
Are you, um, heading to work?
It's so early.

07:49.118 --> 07:50.469
Yeah, I'm doing
a double shift today.

07:50.620 --> 07:52.712
I'm working as much
as I can these days.

07:52.806 --> 07:53.880
That's-that's good.

07:54.032 --> 07:55.048
Good to make ships.

07:55.200 --> 07:56.808
We need 'em, 'cause of the war.

07:56.885 --> 07:57.642
Uh, yup.

07:57.794 --> 07:59.369
Okay, well, I'd better go.

07:59.462 --> 08:01.730
-Uh, have a good day.
-You, too.

08:02.799 --> 08:05.633
Uh, are you looking at my feet?

08:05.652 --> 08:07.877
Uh, my... back just went out.

08:07.896 --> 08:09.303
(groaning)

08:09.323 --> 08:10.489
Oh. Should I, uh--

08:10.716 --> 08:12.324
-Oh, my God, it's better.
Silly back.
-Oh.

08:12.551 --> 08:15.160
Anyway, good luck
with making boats.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.146
<i> BOB:</i>
<i>Alice went back to the apartment</i>

08:19.166 --> 08:20.332
<i> and tried to get some sleep</i>

08:20.559 --> 08:22.000
<i> before morning,</i>
<i> but she couldn't.</i>

08:22.227 --> 08:23.910
<i> At breakfast,</i>
<i> she told Gertie everything.</i>

08:24.062 --> 08:26.896
So, you heard
a man speaking German

08:26.915 --> 08:28.898
on the channel
that only plays static?

08:28.917 --> 08:30.342
Yes, and he mentioned
the shipyard.

08:30.569 --> 08:33.995
Uh-huh. And you saw a footprint
in some bird poop?

08:34.089 --> 08:35.405
Yep. Up on the roof.

08:35.423 --> 08:37.407
And you're sure
you weren't dreaming this?

08:37.576 --> 08:39.075
Ma, this happened.

08:39.094 --> 08:40.927
I am 89% sure.

08:41.079 --> 08:43.355
Alice, honey, look at you.
You're exhausted.

08:43.506 --> 08:45.098
You poured coffee
in your oatmeal

08:45.250 --> 08:47.600
and you've been stirring it
for the last five minutes.

08:47.753 --> 08:48.843
What? Why didn't you tell me?

08:48.937 --> 08:50.344
I thought you were
being more efficient

08:50.364 --> 08:51.679
about breakfast or something.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.680
Oh, my God.

08:52.699 --> 08:54.348
Listen, I'm gonna
go to the store

08:54.442 --> 08:55.534
and pick up some groceries.

08:55.761 --> 08:56.926
How about I bring Lily with me?

08:57.020 --> 08:59.037
You can stay here.
Take a little nap.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.947
We won't gossip
about you at all.

09:01.099 --> 09:02.098
Or at least I won't.

09:02.191 --> 09:04.025
Okay. Fine. I'll go lay down.

09:04.119 --> 09:06.936
And we can talk about the spy
in our building later.

09:06.955 --> 09:07.937
Mm-hmm.

09:08.031 --> 09:09.622
♪<i> Your mommy's doing fine</i> ♪

09:09.716 --> 09:11.365
♪<i> Yes, she is.</i> ♪

09:11.385 --> 09:12.609
I am doing fine

09:12.702 --> 09:14.535
and Lily's on my side, Ma.
She heard it, too.

09:14.629 --> 09:16.963
<i> BOB: After a nap, Alice got</i>
<i> the laundry off the line</i>

09:17.057 --> 09:18.631
<i> and went into the living room</i>
<i> to fold it.</i>

09:18.784 --> 09:21.059
<i> LOUISE: Ugh, don't fold</i>
<i> laundry, catch the spy.</i>

09:21.228 --> 09:23.044
Well, I guess even
if there's a spy,

09:23.138 --> 09:24.454
you still got to fold laundry.

09:24.547 --> 09:25.897
I think the next James Bond
movie is about that?

09:26.049 --> 09:27.065
Anyway...

09:27.234 --> 09:28.341
<i> Alice looked out the window</i>

09:28.493 --> 09:30.068
<i> and saw Peter coming</i>
<i> home from work.</i>

09:30.295 --> 09:31.978
<i> Which was strange, because</i>
<i> she'd never seen him come home</i>

09:32.130 --> 09:33.572
<i> in the middle of the day.</i>
<i> And then another guy</i>

09:33.723 --> 09:35.890
<i> who Alice didn't recognize</i>
<i> came up to Peter.</i>

09:35.984 --> 09:38.076
<i> They shook hands, and the guy</i>
<i> started to hand Peter</i>

09:38.227 --> 09:39.727
<i> what looked like</i>
<i> a small package.</i>

09:39.821 --> 09:40.987
<i> -GENE: Small package Peter.</i>
<i> -BOB: Gene.</i>

09:41.081 --> 09:42.247
<i> Peter shook his head</i>

09:42.398 --> 09:43.990
<i> and motioned for the guy</i>
<i> to follow him.</i>

09:44.084 --> 09:45.232
<i> They walked around</i>
<i> the corner and disappeared.</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:46.476
<i> LOUISE:</i>
<i> A handoff!</i>

09:46.494 --> 09:47.827
(gasps) A handoff.

09:47.979 --> 09:49.421
<i> BOB: Alice--</i>
<i> again, very brave person--</i>

09:49.572 --> 09:51.331
<i> ran downstairs to see</i>
<i>if she could get a better look.</i>

09:51.499 --> 09:52.907
<i> But when she got to the alley,</i>

09:52.926 --> 09:54.150
<i> Peter was gone.</i>

09:54.243 --> 09:55.594
<i> And so was the mystery man.</i>

09:55.745 --> 09:56.820
<i> LINDA:</i>
<i> Oh, my.</i>

09:56.838 --> 09:58.838
-GERTIE: Nice bathrobe, lady.
-Hmm?

09:58.932 --> 10:00.506
Oh, hi, Ma.

10:00.601 --> 10:01.749
Mr. Miller. Hello.

10:01.827 --> 10:02.659
Hi, Alice.

10:02.677 --> 10:03.935
I saw Mr. Miller at the store

10:04.162 --> 10:05.586
and we walked back together.

10:05.606 --> 10:06.754
He was just telling me about

10:06.848 --> 10:08.498
the flowers
he planted out front.

10:08.516 --> 10:10.834
Right. Those are pretty,
the flowers.

10:10.852 --> 10:13.278
And, uh, what kind...
would they be?

10:13.429 --> 10:15.505
Delphiniums.
They match your mother's eyes.

10:15.523 --> 10:17.857
Oh, well, more like
my varicose veins.

10:18.009 --> 10:21.286
Well, you do have the prettiest
varicose veins of anyone I know.

10:21.437 --> 10:23.270
Mmm, yeah, well, I bet yours

10:23.365 --> 10:25.106
aren't too shabby
either, mister.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.291
Gertie was gettin' flirty.

10:26.442 --> 10:28.442
So, dear, what are
you doing out here,

10:28.462 --> 10:29.535
in your bathrobe?

10:29.630 --> 10:31.445
Not that Lily's embarrassed
of you at all.

10:31.465 --> 10:33.706
Oh. I just saw
our neighbor Peter.

10:33.800 --> 10:35.800
Another guy handed
him something.

10:35.877 --> 10:37.694
Is this about
the spy stuff again?

10:37.712 --> 10:38.544
Ma. Shush.

10:38.697 --> 10:40.530
Ugh, my daughter
thinks she heard

10:40.623 --> 10:42.807
a German spy
on our roof last night.

10:42.959 --> 10:45.126
She eedsnay more eepslay.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.460
You know, I thought
I heard Fred Astaire

10:46.480 --> 10:49.130
above my apartment,
but I think it's just

10:49.224 --> 10:51.207
that my neighbors must
have extra loud shoes.

10:51.300 --> 10:54.486
(laughs) Extra loud shoes.
You're too much.

10:54.713 --> 10:56.971
You should go up there
and threaten to Ginger them

10:57.065 --> 10:59.232
right in the Rodgers,
if you know what I mean.

10:59.384 --> 11:01.384
Huh. He's taking out
his trash again already?

11:01.403 --> 11:04.053
Good lord, Alice, are you
keeping tabs on everyone?

11:04.072 --> 11:06.072
You try to raise them
to be not too creepy

11:06.224 --> 11:07.481
and look what you get.

11:07.501 --> 11:11.152
Okay, I'm gonna go...
away from here, inside.

11:11.246 --> 11:13.654
Uh, come on, Lily.
Goodbye, Mr. Miller.

11:13.748 --> 11:15.415
And also, Ma, I'm not creepy.

11:15.567 --> 11:18.084
No one thinks that
I'm creepy... at all.

11:18.253 --> 11:20.494
Of course you're not, dear.

11:20.514 --> 11:23.256
(soft static playing)

11:24.259 --> 11:27.243
Alice, honey, should we turn off
the static since Lily's awake?

11:27.262 --> 11:28.502
Well, I'm keeping it on

11:28.596 --> 11:30.355
in case another spy broadcast
comes through.

11:30.432 --> 11:31.597
And before you say anything,

11:31.692 --> 11:33.007
I know you think
I'm being silly,

11:33.026 --> 11:36.010
-but to you I
just say... Meh.
-(coos)

11:36.029 --> 11:40.181
Yeah, you think that's funny?
Bluh, bluh. Mleh.

11:40.200 --> 11:41.774
Okay, well,
I'll leave you to it.

11:41.927 --> 11:44.594
I'm going to Doris's apartment
to play cards with the girls.

11:44.612 --> 11:45.945
We started gambling.

11:46.039 --> 11:47.597
I'm gonna take them
for all they're worth.

11:47.615 --> 11:50.433
-Sounds fun.
-All right, I'll see
you two later.

11:50.452 --> 11:51.601
Good luck with your mom, Lily.

11:51.619 --> 11:53.211
Come and get me
if she gets too weird.

11:53.362 --> 11:54.546
Bye, Ma.

11:54.773 --> 11:55.362
Huh...

11:55.457 --> 11:56.622
Peter, Peter, Peter,

11:56.699 --> 11:59.384
what are you doing,
Mr. Secret Handoff Man?

11:59.535 --> 12:00.552
(gasps)

12:00.779 --> 12:01.970
(panting)

12:02.964 --> 12:05.974
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

12:06.801 --> 12:07.708
Where'd he go? Where is he?

12:07.802 --> 12:09.376
Well, that wasn't good, right?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.620
No, that did not seem good.

12:10.638 --> 12:12.230
-(knocking)
-(gasps) Oh, God. Peter.

12:12.381 --> 12:13.732
<i> GENE: He can radio secrets</i>
<i> to the Germans,</i>

12:13.883 --> 12:16.735
<i> but he can't call before</i>
<i> coming over? Rude Nazi.</i>

12:21.224 --> 12:22.073
Oh, I'm on pins and needles.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.390
I know the story, sort of,

12:23.410 --> 12:24.892
and I'm still
on pins and needles.

12:24.911 --> 12:26.986
-Me, too.
-Does anyone want some popcorn?

12:27.138 --> 12:28.154
Can someone make some popcorn?

12:28.306 --> 12:30.564
No. No popcorn.
Father. Continue. Please.

12:30.584 --> 12:32.475
Okay, so Alice
had just seen Peter

12:32.568 --> 12:33.918
staring up at her
from the sidewalk

12:34.145 --> 12:35.903
<i> and then there was</i>
<i> a knock at the door.</i>

12:35.981 --> 12:37.255
Uh, who is it?

12:37.482 --> 12:39.148
MR. MILLER:
Hi, Alice, it's Mr. Miller.

12:39.317 --> 12:40.592
Oh. Thank God.

12:40.819 --> 12:43.503
Is your mother home? I had
something I wanted to give her.

12:43.597 --> 12:44.745
Coming. Heh.

12:44.839 --> 12:46.656
Oh, how pretty.

12:46.674 --> 12:47.840
I bought them at a flower shop.

12:47.993 --> 12:49.342
I would've picked
the ones I planted,

12:49.494 --> 12:51.494
but then... there'd be
no flowers there.

12:51.513 --> 12:52.920
Do you think she'll like them
or will she think

12:53.014 --> 12:54.588
this is corny
and start avoiding me?

12:54.608 --> 12:56.666
I think she'll think it's
the perfect amount of corny.

12:56.759 --> 12:58.851
Uh, Mom's at her girlfriend's
house, playing cards.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.186
I think they're gambling?

13:00.338 --> 13:01.428
You should watch out
for her, she's trouble.

13:01.523 --> 13:02.280
-Oh, my.
-Come on in.

13:02.431 --> 13:04.190
I'll put these in some water.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.025
Do you want something to drink?
Do you want some tea?

13:06.177 --> 13:07.952
Okay. Can I give you a hand?

13:08.029 --> 13:09.362
Or can I hold the baby for you?

13:09.531 --> 13:11.331
I raised four kids
and six grandkids

13:11.516 --> 13:13.016
and I hardly ever dropped them.

13:13.034 --> 13:14.608
Yeah, okay. Sure. Thank you.

13:14.702 --> 13:17.629
-(babbling)
-(cooing)

13:17.780 --> 13:19.297
Uh, somebody's face is leaking.

13:19.448 --> 13:22.116
Oh, heh. She only drools
on people she likes.

13:22.210 --> 13:23.659
-(laughs)
-Oh, then I'm flattered.

13:23.661 --> 13:27.196
Hey, Mr. Miller, do you know
Peter from down the hall?

13:27.290 --> 13:29.974
Have you ever seen
him act... funny?

13:30.201 --> 13:31.292
What, like a clown?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.869
No. Not quite like a clown...

13:33.038 --> 13:35.129
But more like cagey?

13:35.148 --> 13:36.889
Why? Do you think he's a spy?

13:36.983 --> 13:38.207
Eh... Maybe?

13:38.226 --> 13:40.543
Well, one time I saw him
picking his nose

13:40.636 --> 13:42.712
and then he pretended
he was just scratching it,

13:42.805 --> 13:44.656
but we both know what I saw.

13:44.883 --> 13:46.232
Oh. I'll get that. (gasps)

13:46.326 --> 13:47.808
And that's when Alice saw it.

13:47.828 --> 13:49.977
<i> She knew immediately</i>
<i> what that white smear was.</i>

13:50.071 --> 13:51.162
<i> -LOUISE: Shoe poop.</i>
<i> -TINA: Shoop.</i>

13:51.331 --> 13:52.997
-Uh...
-What's that, hon?

13:53.149 --> 13:55.333
Uh, I got surprised
by the, uh, the kettle.

13:55.484 --> 13:57.410
Why do they make them so loud?
I'm right here.

13:57.562 --> 13:58.911
You know?
You don't got to, like,

13:59.064 --> 14:00.063
scream and whistle so loud.

14:00.156 --> 14:02.006
Well, no. You made a sound

14:02.158 --> 14:03.341
and I said, "What's that, hon?"

14:03.568 --> 14:05.159
and<i> then</i> the kettle
started whistling.

14:05.253 --> 14:07.995
So you must've made a sound
for some other reason.

14:08.164 --> 14:10.256
Oh. You're right. Heh. Gosh.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.075
It was so long ago,
I don't even remember.

14:12.168 --> 14:14.001
Here, uh, l-let me, uh, let me
take, uh, Lily back.

14:14.095 --> 14:16.746
I, uh, don't want her
spitting up on you. Again.

Hi.

Were you calling somebody?

16:21.147 --> 16:25.224
I... was calling... someplace...

16:25.376 --> 16:27.468
because we ran
out of baby powder.

16:27.487 --> 16:29.487
So I called my...

16:29.714 --> 16:30.655
mother at her friend's house

16:30.806 --> 16:32.639
to pick some up on her way home.

16:32.659 --> 16:34.233
Isn't that baby powder?

16:34.327 --> 16:36.310
This? What was that--
Oh, that one?

16:36.479 --> 16:39.905
That baby powder is too powdery.

16:40.058 --> 16:41.749
So, yup.

16:42.651 --> 16:43.984
-Oops.
-(gasps)

16:44.004 --> 16:45.561
That's broken.

16:45.580 --> 16:47.046
<i> GENE: And that's</i>
<i> the problem with landlines.</i>

16:51.327 --> 16:52.735
Ugh, poor Alice. Stuck in a room

16:52.828 --> 16:53.660
with a baby and a spy?

16:53.680 --> 16:55.013
She must've have been terrified.

16:55.164 --> 16:57.073
You know what I would do
if I was cornered by a spy?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.165
-What?
-Diarrhea.

16:58.184 --> 17:00.000
Out of fear or as a weapon?

17:00.094 --> 17:01.260
-Both.
-Good idea.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.095
So, anyway,
Mr. Miller had just ripped

17:03.248 --> 17:04.689
the phone cord out of the wall

17:04.916 --> 17:06.098
and Alice had to think fast.

17:06.251 --> 17:08.342
I just called the police.
They're on their way.

17:08.552 --> 17:10.603
It didn't sound like
they're on their way.

17:10.755 --> 17:11.937

a misunderstanding.

believe anything I say.

Alice and Gertie
got away, got help,

18:40.120 --> 18:41.602
and called the police
who tracked down

18:41.621 --> 18:43.103

18:48.353 --> 18:50.369

a Nazi spy ring.

18:50.463 --> 18:52.371
They found the transmitter,
they got Mr. Miller,

18:52.523 --> 18:53.798
and they got other spies
eventually.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.299

19:36.676 --> 19:38.067
And baggage. I'm guessing.

is<i> Dynasty</i> trivia.

19:47.353 --> 19:49.836
Yeah, she was amazing.
And holding on to the radio

19:49.856 --> 19:51.355
helps keep the story
alive, you know?

19:51.507 --> 19:53.916
Well, I can't wait until I get
to take down a Nazi spy.
