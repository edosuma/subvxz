00:13.416 --> 00:17.250
Your family must be proud of your position
as assistant to the First Lady.

00:17.333 --> 00:18.166
No.

00:18.833 --> 00:20.416
I guess we won't be meeting for a while.

00:21.083 --> 00:23.666
Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks.

00:28.666 --> 00:31.875
You've got a kid on the way too.
You're on a roll, Murakami.

00:31.958 --> 00:35.041
It's all thanks to you, Kohei.
You taught me a lot.

00:36.333 --> 00:37.791
Do you do flattery now too?

00:37.875 --> 00:39.708
No! That's seriously how I feel!

00:43.333 --> 00:46.125
I'll go back to being
an ordinary employee,

00:47.375 --> 00:48.833
but these were good times.

00:49.541 --> 00:50.833
Thank you so much.

00:57.333 --> 00:58.166
Kohei.

01:01.166 --> 01:05.583
Are you sure you're not tired?
You've probably been working too much.

01:07.625 --> 01:10.958
Not at all. I'm perfectly fine.

01:20.916 --> 01:24.875
I really hope you never change, Murakami.

01:25.625 --> 01:26.500
What?

01:29.500 --> 01:32.250
You know how they say
the position transforms the man?

01:34.416 --> 01:38.333
No matter how high up you climb,
I want you to stay the way you are now.

01:41.541 --> 01:43.125
Yes. Of course I will.

01:45.500 --> 01:47.958
-Good. Let's tie this one up tonight.
-Okay.

01:48.041 --> 01:49.041
Thanks.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.666
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.375
It's the prime minister's wish.

03:29.625 --> 03:32.666
BELOVED MAYUMI,
THANK YOU FOR ALWAYS BEING BY MY SIDE.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.125
I'M SORRY I WAS A HOPELESS HUSBAND
WHO CAUSED YOU TROUBLE.

03:52.250 --> 03:53.125
Happy birthday!

03:53.208 --> 03:54.708
-Happy birthday.
-It looks great.

03:54.791 --> 03:57.416
Okay, Hayato. I've got something for you.

03:57.958 --> 04:00.250
Here. Happy birthday.

04:00.333 --> 04:01.375
Yes!

04:02.750 --> 04:03.666
Open it!

04:05.916 --> 04:07.916
-What could it be?
-I wonder what's inside.

04:08.666 --> 04:09.625
What could it be?

04:12.916 --> 04:15.041
Hayato, tell your daddy thank you.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.333
Thank you!

04:16.416 --> 04:20.041
Take good care of it.
And let Natsuki borrow it too.

04:20.125 --> 04:23.125
Hayato and Natsuki
have a present for Daddy too. Right?

04:23.208 --> 04:25.833
-Really? I didn't know about this.
-Yes!

04:27.208 --> 04:28.750
-What is it?
-Here it is.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.666
-Let's give it to him, Hayato.
-What is it?

04:32.208 --> 04:33.125
Come on.

04:33.208 --> 04:35.208
-Here you are.
-Thank you.

04:35.916 --> 04:37.416
What is it?

04:38.250 --> 04:39.833
-Can I take a look?
-Sure!

04:42.375 --> 04:45.125
DADDY

04:45.208 --> 04:46.541
NATSUKI, HAYATO

04:46.625 --> 04:47.833
We drew it together.

04:47.916 --> 04:49.500
-Really?
-Right?

04:49.583 --> 04:50.666
This is great!

04:50.750 --> 04:55.166
When I told them your job had changed,
they wanted to cheer you on.

04:56.125 --> 04:56.958
Yes!

05:00.416 --> 05:01.625
This makes me so happy.

05:02.291 --> 05:03.125
Thank you.

05:03.625 --> 05:05.250
-You're welcome.
-Thank you.

05:05.333 --> 05:07.666
-You're welcome.
-This is a really great picture.

05:07.750 --> 05:09.250
-Isn't it?
-You've gotten good.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.041
This is so great.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.250
Sorry. Excuse me.

05:19.208 --> 05:21.375
-Excuse me.
-Good job!

05:21.458 --> 05:23.458
-Can I see it?
-Look.

05:23.958 --> 05:25.000
Wow! That's so cool!

05:29.583 --> 05:30.625
Hello?

05:30.708 --> 05:32.083
<i>We've got trouble.</i>

05:34.166 --> 05:37.083
<i>An employee at the Chubu Local</i>
<i>Finance Bureau committed suicide.</i>

05:40.500 --> 05:42.250
<i>He's the one who did the tampering.</i>

06:45.958 --> 06:46.833
Matsuda!

06:47.333 --> 06:49.750
We received a report
regarding the Eishin affair.

06:51.708 --> 06:54.916
Someone from the Chubu Local
Finance Bureau committed suicide.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.291
Who?

06:59.041 --> 07:02.041
Kazuya Suzuki
in the Property Administration Department.

07:07.333 --> 07:09.083
When did he die?

07:09.166 --> 07:10.666
Late yesterday afternoon.

07:16.708 --> 07:18.916
Where are you going?

07:28.875 --> 07:30.125
<i>You know something about this?</i>

07:32.750 --> 07:33.625
Yes.

07:36.625 --> 07:39.750
He was desperate,
like he'd been driven into a corner.

07:43.875 --> 07:45.166
Don't let it bother you.

07:46.166 --> 07:49.416
It happens a lot in this line of work.

07:51.416 --> 07:52.250
I realize that.

07:55.458 --> 07:57.708
But it was the week after I visited him.

08:00.916 --> 08:02.750
Oh, there's another thing.

08:03.500 --> 08:08.833
We've received orders from above to
cancel questioning of the others involved.

08:08.916 --> 08:12.833
How come? We can't let it end like this!

08:15.083 --> 08:16.833
I understand that.

08:17.875 --> 08:21.916
But when this kind of thing happens,
we have to follow orders from above.

08:29.708 --> 08:31.833
He was apparently a very devoted employee.

08:35.166 --> 08:36.083
He was.

08:39.166 --> 08:42.500
The public sympathizes with
this kind of emotionally charged incident.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.375
It needs to be dealt with swiftly.

08:50.708 --> 08:51.541
What is it?

08:54.125 --> 08:57.666
I never thought
anyone would die over this.

08:57.750 --> 08:59.750
It's wrong for you to feel responsible.

09:00.625 --> 09:02.708
We'll be bashed in the press for a while.

09:03.333 --> 09:06.333
Find out who'll be problematic
and dig up some dirt we can use on them.

09:08.750 --> 09:09.833
Yes, sir.

09:15.833 --> 09:19.833
CABINET SECRETARIAT
KAZUYA SUZUKI

09:46.000 --> 09:47.083
Yes?

10:04.625 --> 10:08.750
We, too, are perplexed
at the suddenness of this.

10:10.166 --> 10:14.083
Suzuki was known
at the office for his work ethic.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.333
What happened at the office?

10:22.083 --> 10:25.333
We're still looking into it.

10:30.166 --> 10:35.041
Isn't it related to the recent scandal?

10:38.333 --> 10:39.333
Mrs. Suzuki.

10:40.791 --> 10:47.000
From now on, if there is anything
that we can do to assist you,

10:47.958 --> 10:50.625
we plan to do our best to help you.

10:53.875 --> 10:54.916
"From now on"?

10:55.916 --> 11:02.625
Did you hear anything at all
from Suzuki about this incident?

11:08.541 --> 11:13.791
My husband maintained
his oath of secrecy to the end.

11:15.333 --> 11:17.541
He didn't tell me anything.

11:18.833 --> 11:20.041
Is that right?

11:25.000 --> 11:29.083
Why did you come here?

11:31.791 --> 11:35.375
Did Suzuki leave anything behind?

11:37.375 --> 11:38.708
For example,

11:40.625 --> 11:42.250
like a suicide note.

11:53.708 --> 11:57.500
Don't you worry. We're on your side.

11:58.250 --> 12:01.666
Even if he did leak some information,

12:02.250 --> 12:06.333
we will handle it properly.

12:09.833 --> 12:10.708
He didn't leave…

12:13.625 --> 12:14.666
a suicide note.

12:15.250 --> 12:16.541
Are you sure?

12:20.041 --> 12:20.916
Will you…

12:23.833 --> 12:25.750
will you please leave?

12:26.958 --> 12:29.333
I have nothing else to tell you.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.833
All right.

12:49.708 --> 12:53.916
Mrs. Suzuki, watch out for the press.

12:54.625 --> 12:58.791
If anything is said in the wrong way,
it could cause irreparable damage.

13:00.125 --> 13:02.250
We'll be going now. Goodbye.

14:13.416 --> 14:14.250
Ryo.

14:15.416 --> 14:17.666
Ryo! Over here.

14:40.166 --> 14:41.416
Uncle Kazuya…

14:45.375 --> 14:48.541
Please enjoy the meal.
Thank you for coming today.

14:55.958 --> 15:00.125
Ryo, thank you so much.
I know you're busy with school.

15:02.166 --> 15:03.125
It's okay.

15:07.750 --> 15:11.250
This is unbelievable.
The Finance Bureau sure is coldhearted.

15:12.583 --> 15:16.000
How come not a single one
of his co-workers came?

15:21.541 --> 15:22.541
Aunt Mayumi.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.791
I've seen things in the news.

15:31.416 --> 15:33.916
Does this mean
Uncle Kazuya was involved in that?

15:39.083 --> 15:41.833
-He didn't do anything illegal, right?
-Ryo!

15:43.291 --> 15:45.958
I mean, there's no way
Uncle Kazuya would do anything illegal.

15:48.291 --> 15:52.875
And even if he did,
he must have been forced to do it.

15:59.375 --> 16:00.666
You're right.

16:03.583 --> 16:06.291
There's absolutely no way
Uncle Kazuya would ever kill himself.

16:18.166 --> 16:20.125
Allow me to express my condolences.

16:20.208 --> 16:23.583
Did you notice any changes
in Kazuya Suzuki before his death?

16:23.666 --> 16:25.500
Hey! Let us through!

16:25.583 --> 16:28.125
Ryo, I'll get the car.
Take care of Mayumi for me. Excuse me.

16:28.916 --> 16:31.000
How do you feel about the Finance Bureau?

16:31.083 --> 16:34.333
-Hey, back off!
-Was Mr. Suzuki involved in the tampering?

16:34.416 --> 16:35.333
I said cut it out!

16:35.416 --> 16:37.750
-Can you give a statement?
-Comment, please.

16:37.833 --> 16:39.833
I said cut it out!

16:39.916 --> 16:42.333
-Mrs. Suzuki, a comment, please.
-A statement, please.

16:42.416 --> 16:43.625
Please.

16:44.416 --> 16:46.875
Mrs. Suzuki, a comment, please.

17:10.291 --> 17:11.500
Mayumi.

17:12.833 --> 17:13.666
Yes?

17:15.083 --> 17:21.375
I have a friend in a civic organization
that's looking into this affair.

17:22.875 --> 17:26.333
Can I ask them if they can help somehow?

17:29.750 --> 17:32.416
It's just insane
that they would let it end like this.

17:33.916 --> 17:38.791
For them to treat Kazuya like a scapegoat…

17:40.458 --> 17:41.583
I won't stand for it.

18:03.958 --> 18:04.875
I'll park the car.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.416
-Okay.
-Thank you.

18:12.875 --> 18:13.708
What?

18:15.625 --> 18:17.125
Is she a friend?

18:17.625 --> 18:20.291
No, but I know her.

18:23.041 --> 18:25.291
Are you Mr. Suzuki's family?

18:31.291 --> 18:33.666
I'm Anna Matsuda of Touto News.

18:35.250 --> 18:40.000
Allow me to express my sincere condolences
at your sudden loss.

18:43.791 --> 18:46.333
I've been covering
the Eishin Academy affair.

18:48.041 --> 18:52.250
I spoke to Mr. Suzuki
a few times before his death.

18:57.166 --> 18:58.708
What do you want?

18:59.750 --> 19:03.625
The day before the article about
document tampering appeared,

19:05.083 --> 19:07.166
I received a call from your husband.

19:08.250 --> 19:09.083
What?

19:10.833 --> 19:12.458
I can't be certain,

19:13.416 --> 19:18.750
but I believe your husband wanted to
tell me something of extreme importance.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.416
If there's anything you might know,

19:26.250 --> 19:28.000
can you please contact me?

19:33.708 --> 19:34.583
Hey!

19:35.083 --> 19:38.500
You there! What do you think
you're doing? How rude!

19:39.125 --> 19:40.666
What's your problem, Ryo?

19:40.750 --> 19:42.333
Well, I…

19:42.416 --> 19:44.250
How can you do that at a time like this?

19:44.833 --> 19:47.958
We're his family!
Have some consideration for us!

20:14.500 --> 20:15.375
Good morning.

20:17.583 --> 20:18.708
I think it looks fine.

20:18.791 --> 20:20.916
Boss! Can we talk?

20:24.208 --> 20:25.041
What is it?

20:25.958 --> 20:28.291
Why isn't this Eishin article on page one?

20:28.375 --> 20:31.291
Matsuda, it's a little late for that.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.916
It should get more attention.
This makes no sense.

20:34.000 --> 20:36.208
There was simply something better
for the front page.

20:36.916 --> 20:39.083
Besides, this kind of thing
happens all the time.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.500
A man has died!

20:41.250 --> 20:44.125
What's more, the administration
denies any involvement.

20:45.208 --> 20:47.750
Since they deny it, there's no reason
to make a big deal of it.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.708
-But--
-Fine. But you listen.

20:56.208 --> 20:59.000
The politics reporters are having
all kinds of trouble because of you.

20:59.958 --> 21:01.916
They're getting pressured.

21:03.708 --> 21:07.541
There are other reporters
who do their jobs more tactfully than you.

21:08.041 --> 21:11.541
You've got to think more
about the newspaper as a whole.

21:16.791 --> 21:19.250
What do you mean by "more tactfully"?

21:22.250 --> 21:24.666
Are you telling me to bow to authority?

21:24.750 --> 21:26.166
Matsuda…

21:30.375 --> 21:32.875
At any rate, bring us more solid proof.

21:34.458 --> 21:35.500
We're done.

21:48.125 --> 21:49.250
Excuse me.

21:50.541 --> 21:52.083
How much longer?

21:52.166 --> 21:53.750
I'm checking on it now.

21:54.333 --> 21:56.500
I've been waiting for over 30 minutes.

21:56.583 --> 22:00.375
I'm looking for someone who can help you.
Please wait a little longer.

22:03.625 --> 22:07.208
NATIONAL CIVIL SERVICE ETHICS CARD

22:10.250 --> 22:12.666
It's all okay. Take it to her.

22:16.041 --> 22:18.375
Chief, you're not going to see her?

22:20.333 --> 22:21.500
Is there a problem with that?

22:23.541 --> 22:24.375
No.

22:46.791 --> 22:49.541
Thank you for waiting. Here they are.

22:55.791 --> 23:00.416
Now that things have come to this,
I'm not sure what to say.

23:10.291 --> 23:11.791
Where is the bureau chief?

23:13.875 --> 23:16.291
He's very busy right now.

23:19.625 --> 23:21.333
Why won't he see me?

23:23.500 --> 23:28.666
Do you plan on
forgetting all about my husband?

23:28.750 --> 23:32.041
No. Absolutely not.

23:35.791 --> 23:37.458
I am terribly sorry.

23:44.083 --> 23:45.291
Mr. Kurosaki.

23:48.541 --> 23:49.541
My husband…

23:52.291 --> 23:54.916
greatly revered you.

24:02.333 --> 24:03.625
I am terribly sorry.

25:34.416 --> 25:37.666
they have an extreme dislike
for change and criticism.

25:39.291 --> 25:41.583
The opposition party
eagerly criticizes the administration.

25:42.083 --> 25:43.833
But the more they demand change,

25:44.416 --> 25:46.750
the more they scare off
the younger generation.

25:47.500 --> 25:50.041
Those people don't understand this.

25:51.916 --> 25:54.958
If you put on a show for the public
with this in mind,

25:55.041 --> 25:56.958
it will be easy to stay in power.

25:58.333 --> 25:59.708
I see.

26:01.416 --> 26:03.041
This is extremely helpful.

26:03.625 --> 26:07.041
Let's put this in election pledges
and campaign materials right away.

26:08.208 --> 26:11.041
<i>The younger generation gets</i>
<i>the majority of their news online.</i>

26:11.625 --> 26:15.125
<i>The best approach is to focus on</i>
<i>building up your image there.</i>

26:19.791 --> 26:21.000
That reminds me.

26:22.208 --> 26:25.250
Is the Eishin Academy affair
working out all right?

26:26.666 --> 26:29.625
I heard that someone has died.

26:30.916 --> 26:32.916
Sorry to worry you.

26:33.916 --> 26:37.041
Opposition questions and stories
in the papers are causing trouble.

26:38.166 --> 26:40.791
They make a big deal
over the tiniest of things.

26:41.750 --> 26:43.416
They have nothing better to do.

26:44.041 --> 26:45.916
They live by a misplaced sense of justice.

26:49.625 --> 26:53.166
If you know of an effective way
of handling it, please tell me.

26:53.250 --> 26:54.666
Most certainly.

27:04.583 --> 27:07.541
I wish something could be done about that.

27:08.041 --> 27:11.083
How can you live a proper life
under these circumstances?

27:17.708 --> 27:19.541
I know it's been difficult for you,
Mrs. Suzuki.

27:20.666 --> 27:21.916
You must be exasperated.

27:28.250 --> 27:31.750
Your husband was murdered
by the Ministry of Finance.

27:32.625 --> 27:35.416
We should take appropriate action.

27:36.333 --> 27:39.166
We will give you our support.

27:41.583 --> 27:43.541
What do you mean by "appropriate action"?

27:46.500 --> 27:48.000
We'll file criminal charges.

27:49.166 --> 27:51.958
We'll introduce you to a lawyer
who specializes in this.

27:55.375 --> 28:00.625
Mayumi, let's ask for their help.
I'll assist you with that as well.

28:03.291 --> 28:10.041
Even though Kazuya was busy with work,
he was always like a father to Ryo.

28:12.833 --> 28:14.625
I can't sit by and do nothing.

28:16.833 --> 28:17.791
Thank you.

28:19.791 --> 28:23.250
But… I'm afraid.

28:24.250 --> 28:26.375
There are many ways this can be handled.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.291
You don't have to appear in public.

28:30.291 --> 28:33.333
We will press charges
as a civic organization.

28:33.833 --> 28:35.000
Let's do this, please.

28:35.833 --> 28:36.958
Let's do this.

28:56.458 --> 28:57.500
This way, please.

29:00.875 --> 29:01.833
Excuse me.

29:03.625 --> 29:07.041
I am Ryo Kinoshita, a junior
in economics at Higashiyama University.

29:07.125 --> 29:08.416
It's nice to meet you.

29:09.083 --> 29:10.666
-Please have a seat.
-Thank you.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.083
This is unusual nowadays.

29:14.166 --> 29:17.333
I see that you're a newspaper deliveryman,
Mr. Kinoshita.

29:17.416 --> 29:18.333
Yes, I am.

29:18.916 --> 29:21.291
Why did you take work
delivering newspapers?

29:23.250 --> 29:28.125
Well, my mom's a single mother,
so I'm doing it for the scholarship.

29:29.041 --> 29:30.000
Is that right?

29:31.166 --> 29:33.083
Let's get to some questions.

29:33.583 --> 29:37.458
Has there been anything in the news
recently that has interested you?

29:37.541 --> 29:39.291
Let's start with you, Mr. Nakano.

29:39.375 --> 29:41.625
Yes. The Eishin Academy scandal.

29:42.208 --> 29:46.041
I see. What is your opinion
about the Eishin Academy scandal?

29:46.125 --> 29:48.708
Due to pointless and endless probing,

29:48.791 --> 29:51.333
the Diet is unable to function properly.

29:51.416 --> 29:53.500
The Diet is where topics
such as foreign relations

29:53.583 --> 29:56.083
and the economy should be debated.

29:56.166 --> 30:00.666
I don't believe it is meaningful
to debate insignificant issues there.

30:03.666 --> 30:05.250
What about you, Kinoshita?

30:06.916 --> 30:07.791
What do you think?

30:12.583 --> 30:14.750
Well…

30:17.166 --> 30:18.041
I mean,

30:19.250 --> 30:23.041
someone has died over this,
so I would disagree.

30:27.041 --> 30:30.916
Then would you like to
tell us your opinion?

30:38.666 --> 30:39.500
Well…

30:40.250 --> 30:43.458
I'm sorry. I don't really have one.

30:46.500 --> 30:48.166
Let's move on to the next question.

30:48.666 --> 30:50.708
Thank you.

30:55.958 --> 30:57.833
What happened to you just now, Ryo?

30:59.041 --> 31:00.041
Nothing.

31:01.750 --> 31:05.000
Nakamachi Trading is closely aligned
with the current administration.

31:05.083 --> 31:06.875
At least it was a practice interview.

31:06.958 --> 31:09.166
If it wasn't,
you'd be slitting your own throat.

31:11.416 --> 31:12.708
You may be right.

31:13.833 --> 31:16.666
What's gotten into you?
You've been acting funny.

31:16.750 --> 31:18.708
Now's when the real job hunting starts.

31:18.791 --> 31:21.750
I'm meeting with some alumni after this.
See you around. Bye.

31:23.416 --> 31:24.958
-Hang in there.
-Thanks.

31:31.791 --> 31:32.666
Ryo?

31:34.250 --> 31:35.708
Oh, Mayu.

31:39.333 --> 31:40.166
What?

31:41.416 --> 31:43.708
You look awful in that suit.

31:44.291 --> 31:45.625
Jeez. Who asked you?

31:47.375 --> 31:49.833
It feels weird seeing you in the daytime.

31:51.208 --> 31:52.125
How come?

31:52.958 --> 31:56.125
No reason. I didn't know
you wore makeup, Mayu.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.583
Of course I do. Most women do, you know.

31:59.666 --> 32:00.500
I guess so.

32:02.875 --> 32:04.625
You actually are looking for a job.

32:05.666 --> 32:08.833
Yes. How about you, Mayu?

32:09.333 --> 32:13.208
Well, I'm trying to get into
trading companies or consulting.

32:13.708 --> 32:15.333
Places with good salaries first.

32:16.166 --> 32:18.333
I want to pay off
my student loans quickly.

32:19.333 --> 32:22.416
Really? As usual,
you've got your act together.

32:23.333 --> 32:27.333
Considering the times,
you've got to look out for yourself.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.375
You know, things sure are getting crazy
in your hometown, Ryo.

32:32.875 --> 32:34.250
Have you seen the news?

32:36.333 --> 32:37.875
TRAGEDY OF CHUBU FINANCE BUREAU
EMPLOYEE'S SUICIDE OVER SCANDAL

32:37.958 --> 32:39.541
IS THE REAL CULPRIT FORMER FINANCE BUREAU
DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI?

32:40.208 --> 32:41.208
Yes.

32:44.458 --> 32:47.250
I thought a national civil servant
would be a good job.

32:48.125 --> 32:51.666
They get a stable salary
and a huge pension.

32:52.416 --> 32:54.458
But I'm glad I chose a private company.

32:55.791 --> 32:57.041
I mean, he committed suicide.

33:01.791 --> 33:02.625
What's wrong?

33:04.583 --> 33:05.458
What?

33:06.125 --> 33:07.916
Nothing. You're right.

33:09.250 --> 33:11.083
-It must be rough.
-Yes.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.958
Kohei. It's been a while.

33:55.833 --> 33:59.166
It's Murakami. We worked together
at the Ministry of Economy.

34:01.000 --> 34:05.791
You taught me a lot
in our bid for the Olympics.

34:11.458 --> 34:12.666
Kohei.

34:47.750 --> 34:50.041
What happened to you, Kohei?

35:03.458 --> 35:07.666
CHARGES FILED AGAINST FORMER FINANCE
BUREAU DIRECTOR-GENERAL MOURI AND OTHERS

35:08.416 --> 35:09.291
Come in.

35:10.916 --> 35:13.875
Yagawa, the indictment has arrived.

35:15.375 --> 35:17.958
It's in the papers too.
Have the brass made a decision?

35:18.041 --> 35:20.208
Yes. Reopen the investigation.

35:21.458 --> 35:22.333
Got it.

35:23.916 --> 35:25.375
-Yagawa.
-Yes?

35:26.166 --> 35:29.333
Apparently, the brass
are already under a lot of pressure.

35:30.666 --> 35:32.333
Make sure you do it by the book.

35:33.375 --> 35:34.458
I know.

35:39.125 --> 35:41.208
If Special Investigations is moving,

35:41.291 --> 35:44.250
do you think the PM will resign
if they find a connection?

35:45.083 --> 35:47.250
He did say
he wasn't involved right in public.

35:47.958 --> 35:50.916
If that happened,
this would be a historic event.

35:51.000 --> 35:53.166
That's for sure.

35:56.166 --> 35:58.750
<i>-It says there's a criminal investigation.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

35:58.833 --> 36:00.875
<i>I guess they've found some evidence, huh?</i>

36:00.958 --> 36:03.583
Yeah. Guess there's no shifting blame now.

36:03.666 --> 36:05.166
I wouldn't be so sure.

36:05.250 --> 36:06.375
How come?

36:06.458 --> 36:09.958
I mean, they've always done
that kind of thing.

36:10.041 --> 36:11.125
Really?

36:11.208 --> 36:13.583
Special Investigations involvement
doesn't mean much.

36:13.666 --> 36:16.125
-But it's a criminal investigation, right?
-Yes.

36:32.708 --> 36:36.750
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION
INTO CHUBU LOCAL FINANCE BUREAU

36:45.000 --> 36:47.416
Nagoya Regional Public Prosecutor
Special Investigations.

36:47.500 --> 36:49.458
Who's in charge here?

36:57.291 --> 36:59.958
<i>The Nagoya Regional Public Prosecutor</i>
<i>Special Investigations</i>

37:00.041 --> 37:02.833
<i>have entered the Chubu Local</i>
<i>Finance Bureau to conduct a search.</i>

37:02.916 --> 37:07.375
<i>The search is happening at this very</i>
<i>moment inside this building behind me.</i>

37:07.458 --> 37:11.458
<i>Will the points that have been obscured</i>
<i>until now, such as the altered documents…</i>

37:20.916 --> 37:23.416
THE PRESS MUST HOLD
THOSE IN POWER ACCOUNTABLE.

37:23.500 --> 37:26.416
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PURSUE
AND KNOW THE TRUTH.

37:26.500 --> 37:28.833
I PRAY FOR A FAIR DECISION.
#EISHINACADEMYSCANDAL

37:28.916 --> 37:31.208
<i>Investigators from</i>
<i>the Nagoya Regional Public Prosecutor</i>

37:31.291 --> 37:33.416
<i>have just left carrying cardboard boxes.</i>

37:33.958 --> 37:37.750
<i>The items seized in the search</i>
<i>just keep on coming.</i>

37:38.375 --> 37:42.125
<i>There appears to be a large number</i>
<i>of documents seized in the search.</i>

37:42.208 --> 37:45.958
<i>Will the altered documents involving</i>
<i>the Eishin Academy affair come to light…</i>

37:46.041 --> 37:47.375
Nakagawa here.

37:49.083 --> 37:53.666
Right. I apologize for the trouble.

37:53.750 --> 37:56.041
THE PRESS MUST HOLD
THOSE IN POWER ACCOUNTABLE.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.083
-Go ahead with it.
-Right.

38:12.166 --> 38:14.041
Please check this.

38:16.791 --> 38:20.083
We'll look into this very thoroughly.

38:25.333 --> 38:26.916
-Let's go.
-All right.

38:50.041 --> 38:52.541
5 MONTHS LATER

38:53.375 --> 38:54.708
Sorry.

38:54.791 --> 38:57.875
-A decision came faster than expected.
-That's for sure.

38:57.958 --> 39:00.708
If they implicate the PM,
this will make the front page for sure.

39:00.791 --> 39:03.333
NAGOYA REGIONAL PUBLIC PROSECUTORS OFFICE
PRESS CONFERENCE ROOM

39:18.041 --> 39:20.291
Let's begin this press conference.

39:21.291 --> 39:26.750
First, I'd like to report about
the Eishin Academy case.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.625
Regarding the 24 people
placed under investigation,

39:30.708 --> 39:34.375
including former Finance Bureau
Director-General Mouri, we've decided

39:36.250 --> 39:37.500
not to prosecute any of them.

39:42.125 --> 39:43.375
Order, please.

39:45.375 --> 39:46.875
Order, please!

39:46.958 --> 39:48.958
What is the meaning of this?

39:49.041 --> 39:51.416
As for the tampering
with official documents,

39:51.500 --> 39:54.500
the tampered documents were
related to the discounting…

40:04.958 --> 40:06.291
This makes zero sense to me!

40:07.125 --> 40:09.916
How can you decide not to prosecute
so early in the investigation?

40:10.000 --> 40:11.916
Do you want to fight
the Supreme Public Prosecutor

40:12.000 --> 40:13.416
and the Ministry of Justice?

40:14.458 --> 40:18.583
Then that means the people
at the very top made this decision!

40:22.791 --> 40:24.291
This makes no sense at all to me.

40:25.583 --> 40:26.916
Deal with it!

40:29.541 --> 40:31.541
<i>-We're interrupting this program.</i>
-Mr. Kitamura!

40:31.625 --> 40:33.666
<i>We now bring you breaking news.</i>

40:34.250 --> 40:37.375
<i>Sorry for interrupting this program,</i>
<i>but we have an urgent news flash.</i>

40:37.958 --> 40:41.291
<i>The Nagoya Regional Public Prosecutor</i>
<i>has decided not to prosecute</i>

40:41.375 --> 40:44.916
<i>former Director-General Mouri</i>
<i>and others for tampering</i>

40:45.000 --> 40:47.875
<i>with Eishin Academy documents</i>
<i>due to insufficient evidence.</i>

40:48.625 --> 40:50.625
<i>In response to this,</i>
<i>the Ministry of Finance</i>

40:50.708 --> 40:52.875
<i>will make an announcement</i>
<i>about an investigation</i>

40:52.958 --> 40:55.750
<i>into this affair</i>
<i>and their decision regarding Mr. Mouri.</i>

40:56.375 --> 40:58.875
<i>The finance minister</i>
<i>has stated that he will</i>

40:58.958 --> 41:02.916
<i>strive to prevent future recurrences</i>
<i>and to regain the trust of the people.</i>

41:03.000 --> 41:06.375
MOURI AND 24 OTHERS NOT TO BE PROSECUTED
IN EISHIN ACADEMY SCANDAL

41:07.875 --> 41:08.791
What?

41:11.250 --> 41:13.458
-What is it?
-Nothing.

41:19.916 --> 41:21.333
MOURI AND 24 OTHERS NOT TO BE PROSECUTED
IN EISHIN ACADEMY SCANDAL

41:21.416 --> 41:23.791
Is that right? Understood.

41:27.041 --> 41:28.583
Start putting out the fires.

41:32.416 --> 41:33.458
Wait a minute.

41:36.916 --> 41:39.791
This is…

41:41.791 --> 41:43.750
This affair is now over.

44:19.083 --> 44:23.625
The characters and events
that appear in this work are fictitious

44:23.708 --> 44:26.125
and do not depict real life.
