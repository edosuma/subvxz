YOU'RE A GOOD BOY,
OLIVER. YEAH.

19:11.484 --> 19:12.717
SO!

19:12.719 --> 19:15.553
TELL ME.
DID YOU FIND YOUR "GRAMMA"?

19:15.555 --> 19:16.854
WE THINK WE DID,

19:16.856 --> 19:18.256
BUT SHE WOULDN'T
ADMIT IT.

19:18.258 --> 19:20.424
I THINK THAT OWEN
IS HER GRANDSON,

19:20.426 --> 19:22.460
AND THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT SHE'S NOT SAYING,

19:22.462 --> 19:24.262
BECAUSE--I DON'T--
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

19:24.264 --> 19:26.464
DID YOU NOTICE HOW
MRS. LASSETER

19:26.466 --> 19:28.399
BECAME UPSET
WHEN SHE SAW OWEN'S DRAWING

19:28.401 --> 19:29.734
ON THE BACK OF THE ENVELOPE?

19:29.736 --> 19:31.302
THAT'S WHEN
SHE ASKED DONNA

19:31.304 --> 19:32.803
TO LEAVE,
TO GET HER SWEATER.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.573
BUT WHEN I BROUGHT IT BACK,
SHE NEVER PUT IT ON.

19:35.575 --> 19:37.875
VIVIAN WANTED
DONNA TO LEAVE THE ROOM.

19:37.877 --> 19:40.211
AND DONNA WAS AWFULLY EAGER
TO READ THAT LETTER.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.213
AND VIVIAN MADE
AN AWFULLY BIG DEAL

19:42.215 --> 19:44.615
ABOUT HOW SHE DIDN'T KNOW
ANYBODY NAMED <i>OWEN.</i>

19:44.617 --> 19:46.751
WAIT A SECOND! DIDN'T DONNA SAY
SHE KNEW EVERYONE'S BIRTHDAY?

19:46.753 --> 19:48.786
THAT'S RIGHT!
EXCEPT SHE DIDN'T KNOW SALLY'S.

19:48.788 --> 19:50.688
AND VIVIAN MADE SURE
THAT WE HEARD THAT.

19:50.690 --> 19:54.292
SO DONNA'S TAKEN A REAL INTEREST
IN VIVIAN.

19:54.294 --> 19:55.593
BUT WHY?

19:55.595 --> 19:57.528
[CLINK... CLINK]

19:58.530 --> 19:59.630

19:59.632 --> 20:00.631

20:00.633 --> 20:02.500

20:02.502 --> 20:04.735
SHE HAD WINDCHIMES IN HER ROOM
MADE OUT OF OLD SPOONS!

20:04.737 --> 20:06.871
I BET YOU THAT'S WHY VIVIAN
GOT ME TO GO GET HER SWEATER!

20:06.873 --> 20:07.805
AND OWEN WAS BRINGING
MORE SPOONS

20:07.807 --> 20:09.607
"TO MAKE ANOTHER ONE."

20:09.609 --> 20:11.342

ABOUT FAMILY

20:11.344 --> 20:12.710

REJECTING OWEN.

20:17.716 --> 20:20.451
SHE WAS PROTECTING HIM.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.489

ANYTHING YOU CAN ABOUT DONNA.

YOU HAVE TO DO

20:26.960 --> 20:28.492

STOP THINKING ABOUT

20:43.543 --> 20:44.741
THIS SWEET LADY
THAT I MET TODAY,

20:44.743 --> 20:46.477

I'D COME BACK AND VISIT HER.

HMM. AND WHO
WOULD THAT BE?

20:47.847 --> 20:50.548
WELL, SHE HAD GRAY HAIR,

20:54.621 --> 20:56.420
SHE REMINDS ME
OF MY MOTHER.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.823
THAT WOULD
BE SHIRLEY.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.259
IF YOU'VE COME BACK TO SEE HER,
OR ANYONE ELSE,

21:01.261 --> 21:03.361
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHECK IN
AGAIN AT THE FRONT DESK.

21:03.363 --> 21:04.495
OH, THAT'S SO GREAT,

21:05.565 --> 21:06.998
THERE'S NOBODY
AT THE FRONT DESK,

WHAT OWEN SAID?

21:39.766 --> 21:41.732
"I MISS MAKING SPOONS WITH YOU.

21:41.734 --> 21:44.835
I HAVE MINE HANGING
ON THE APPLE TREE OUTSIDE."

21:44.837 --> 21:47.471
I BET... THEY BOTH MADE ONE.

21:48.840 --> 21:50.808
WE DID.

21:54.780 --> 21:57.648
THE DAY WE MADE
THOSE WINDCHIMES...

21:58.950 --> 22:01.452
WAS THE LAST DAY I SAW HIM.

22:02.688 --> 22:04.689

22:05.957 --> 22:09.026

NO MATTER HOW FAR APART WE ARE,

22:13.933 --> 22:17.401
WE SHOULD
ALWAYS LEAVE THEM UP...

22:17.403 --> 22:19.403
