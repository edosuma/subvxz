<i>(woman)</i> You don't know
where you're going.

00:50.350 --> 00:53.217
Yes, I do.

00:53.286 --> 00:57.620
- You don't know where you are.
- Yes, I do. I'm in hell.

00:57.690 --> 01:02.923
Just get in the car.
You cannot walk the entire way to...

01:04.063 --> 01:07.158
- This was your choice.
- This was not my choice, Mom.

01:07.233 --> 01:11.761
What, to live with some old bitch
that you can't even stand that I don't even know?

01:11.838 --> 01:14.602
You wanted me out of your life,
I'm out of your life, Mom.

01:14.674 --> 01:17.074
You're impossible. You are impossible.

01:17.143 --> 01:19.338
If you weren't such a nutcase,

01:19.412 --> 01:22.870
we could have flown here
like normal people and been done with this shit.

01:22.949 --> 01:26.407
You won, OK? You won.
I'm out of your life.

01:26.486 --> 01:29.546
- No one has won.
- I'm out of your life.

01:29.622 --> 01:32.750
Now if you please would just get out of mine.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.556
- Go. Get out.
- All right, fine.

02:42.996 --> 02:45.089
<i>(man)</i> Hello?

02:59.012 --> 03:00.536
- <i>(screams)</i>
- Hey! Whoa!

03:00.613 --> 03:03.275
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!

03:03.349 --> 03:06.011
Who are you?

03:06.085 --> 03:08.553
Hey, I didn't mean nothing.
Just calm down.

03:08.621 --> 03:12.079
My God, are you one of those
back-country sodomy boys?

03:12.158 --> 03:14.820
I didn't mean any harm.

03:15.895 --> 03:18.227
Can you help me up, please?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.296
- Are you crazy?
- No.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.233
I'm Rachel.

03:24.304 --> 03:27.000
- Harlan Wilson.
- <i>(dog barks)</i>

03:27.073 --> 03:29.837
You got yourself a nice feel there,
didn't you, Harlan Wilson?

03:29.909 --> 03:33.242
- Hey, that wasn't my intention.
- What were your intentions?

03:33.313 --> 03:36.111
- To see if you were dead.
- <i>(honks horn)</i>

03:36.182 --> 03:38.173
<i>(dog barks)</i>

03:38.818 --> 03:40.843
Car trouble, Harlan?

03:41.487 --> 03:44.547
Hey, I had one of these.
Till I crashed it. Can I drive?

03:44.624 --> 03:48.060
- Beg your pardon?
- I found her sleeping by the side of the road.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.857
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

03:50.930 --> 03:53.330
- Says her name's Rachel.
- Yeah?

03:53.399 --> 03:57.199
If she turns out to be sane...
you know, she's all yours.

03:57.270 --> 04:00.535
- I gotta get back to work.
- Hey.

04:00.607 --> 04:04.634
Is for horses. Better for cows.
Pigs don't eat it 'cause they don't know how.

04:04.711 --> 04:07.908
- What's your name?
- Simon.

04:07.981 --> 04:08.913
Hmm.

04:10.350 --> 04:12.682
- I wasn't really going anywhere.
- That's where I'm going.

04:12.752 --> 04:13.878
- Where?
- Anywhere.

04:13.953 --> 04:17.116
- I was going there alone.
- Now you're not. Consider yourself lucky.

04:17.190 --> 04:21.718
- I would if you weren't here.
- Mm. Consider yourself stuck.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.527
<i>(starts engine/drives off)</i>

04:27.233 --> 04:30.964
- <i>(Simon)</i> I don't like to talk.
- <i>(Rachel)</i> Perfect. I don't like to listen.

04:35.475 --> 04:36.635
<i>(sighs)</i>

04:41.381 --> 04:45.147
- Would you put your legs back in my car?
- Changing the rules?

04:45.218 --> 04:49.678
There were no rules.
Other than no parts of your body outside my car.

04:49.756 --> 04:52.782
- Well, then, can I talk to you?
- Put your legs down.

04:52.859 --> 04:55.794
You didn't say "Simon says," Simon.

04:58.164 --> 05:02.191
- I'm only going as far as Hull.
- Hull, Idaho? That's where I'm staying.

05:02.268 --> 05:04.395
My luck.

05:04.470 --> 05:07.837
Now, do you need to call someone,
or are you a surprise?

05:07.907 --> 05:13.106
I would. My mother cut my phone service off.
She's a gem.

05:45.945 --> 05:50.939
Nuh-uh. Ace is only low.
Not high. Georgia rule.

05:51.017 --> 05:54.009
Everybody else plays the right way.
Why can't we?

05:54.087 --> 05:59.286
So if everybody took a poop in the middle of Main
Street you'd do it too? 'Cause they said it was right?

05:59.359 --> 06:01.953
- Probably.
- My leg is numb.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.462
Hey, no quitting.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.158
I got pains from my gluteus
shooting up and out my eyes

06:07.233 --> 06:10.259
from sitting on the floor
with two boneless children.

06:10.336 --> 06:13.203
Quitting?
Did you hear me say "quitting"?

06:18.144 --> 06:20.135
<i>(dog barking)</i>

06:25.685 --> 06:26.982
Rummy.

06:27.053 --> 06:29.578
- Uhh.
- <i>(knock on door)</i>

06:29.655 --> 06:33.022
- Mom?
- Wait. No, we can't go. I'm winning.

06:34.293 --> 06:37.751
- Hello. You're not Mom.
- Hello.

06:37.830 --> 06:40.264
Lilly. Come on in.

06:43.836 --> 06:49.797
- Come on, boys. Erect me.
- She has gluten pains shooting out her eyeballs.

06:57.116 --> 06:59.482
Where's Rachel?

06:59.552 --> 07:05.548
I thought this drive would be good for us.
That we could talk, at least tolerate each other.

07:06.659 --> 07:09.025
Where is my granddaughter?

07:09.095 --> 07:11.427
She bolted from the car.

07:16.569 --> 07:19.402
You look really nice, anyway, Lilly.

07:19.472 --> 07:22.236
I should have put her on a plane.

07:22.308 --> 07:24.640
- Still smoke?
- No.

07:25.044 --> 07:29.947
Did I ask if you still dye your hair? I haven't had
a drink in years, in case you wanted to know.

07:30.016 --> 07:33.247
- It's none of my business.
- Yeah? Heh-heh.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.378
I brought you a gift.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.424
- Oh, it's lovely.
- How do you know?

07:38.491 --> 07:42.621
The ribbon and the paper. How's she gonna
find me? She's only been here once.

07:42.695 --> 07:45.721
13 years ago. Same as you.

07:45.798 --> 07:50.565
Rachel is very resourceful.
She'll find you when she needs you.

07:50.636 --> 07:52.695
Why are children in your house?

07:52.772 --> 07:57.141
They're my friends. Here, guys.
I watch them till their mom gets home.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.235
This is Sam. This is Ethan.

07:59.312 --> 08:02.179
- Nice to meet you.
- This is my daughter Lilly.

08:02.248 --> 08:03.476
Hi.

08:04.917 --> 08:10.355
Traveled all the way from San Francisco, California,
smelling of smoke. But she doesn't smoke.

08:10.423 --> 08:12.254
OK, Mother, caught me.

08:12.325 --> 08:15.522
Save the lies for something
more important than cancer.

08:15.595 --> 08:18.689
Why don't you go get the bags, you two?

08:18.764 --> 08:22.894
Oh, um, you know what?
Everything but the Louis Vuittons.

08:22.969 --> 08:26.200
They have "LV" written all over 'em.

08:28.407 --> 08:32.866
- You travel with luggage you don't use?
- Oh, I'm just staying a minute.

08:32.945 --> 08:37.678
I have friends. They're begging me
to come down to Salt Lake City and visit.

08:37.750 --> 08:40.183
Good friends?

08:40.253 --> 08:42.778
We keep in touch.

08:42.855 --> 08:45.323
Well, it's worth the drive, then.

08:48.261 --> 08:50.729
Bringing up the girl's bags.

08:50.796 --> 08:53.128
I think they got rocks in 'em.

08:56.602 --> 08:59.127
<i>(chirps)</i>

08:59.205 --> 09:02.800
Everything's exactly the same,
except for the bird.

09:04.443 --> 09:08.641
It's a glass... bedpan?

09:08.714 --> 09:11.979
Heh-heh. Crystal bowl. It's classy.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.250
- I thought of one for my mantel.
- Take this one, then.

09:16.322 --> 09:18.950
It's a gift, Mother.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.660
It's just there's so much on my mantel.

09:22.728 --> 09:26.061
Well, look around,
because I'm not taking it back.

09:26.132 --> 09:27.497
Thank you.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.968
It's lovely. Nice, thanks.

09:31.938 --> 09:36.932
- Well, this is Hull.
- Just drop me in town. Nice to know you, Simon.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.671
- You don't know me, kid.
- I know you.

09:39.745 --> 09:41.906
You do?

09:42.648 --> 09:45.879
I had my dress hiked and my legs up,
and you didn't look once.

09:45.952 --> 09:48.546
Not even for a second.

09:48.621 --> 09:50.816
So now you know me?

09:50.890 --> 09:54.792
No marriage ring.
What are you, 30? 40?

09:55.361 --> 09:57.352
You're gay.

10:02.902 --> 10:06.838
- All right, get out.
- I already asked you to let me out.

10:06.906 --> 10:11.843
- I'm telling you.
- What? You can't tell me what I've already asked.

10:11.911 --> 10:14.744
Get out. Just get out.

10:17.216 --> 10:21.152
I want my panties back
when you're done with them.

10:23.155 --> 10:27.057
Harlan found her sleeping
by the side of the road.

10:27.126 --> 10:30.562
- Do you buy that?
- He's a wonderful doctor.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.791
<i>(starts engine)</i>

10:48.014 --> 10:51.814
- Thanks for the sandwich.
- You won't make it to your friends' before dark.

10:51.884 --> 10:56.184
- That wasn't really my goal.
- Accidents mostly happen at dusk.

10:56.255 --> 11:00.191
- I would guess morning.
- Well, you'd be wrong.

11:00.259 --> 11:02.659
All in God's hands.

11:02.728 --> 11:05.561
- That's what your father always used to say.
- Uh-huh.

11:05.631 --> 11:08.065
Everybody's hands but his own.

11:09.101 --> 11:12.127
You never said anything bad about him
when he was alive.

11:12.204 --> 11:15.332
Well, if I did, why would I say it to you?

11:16.642 --> 11:21.739
Why say anything? Your granddaughter
takes off when she doesn't get her way.

11:21.814 --> 11:24.647
She's easy to find, though.
Just listen for a scream.

11:24.717 --> 11:30.713
If she doesn't show up in the next few hours,
call me on my cellphone, I'll turn around.

11:32.792 --> 11:35.192
Thank you for taking her.

11:35.561 --> 11:38.155
I hope it does her some good.

11:38.230 --> 11:40.698
Did it do you any good?

11:48.674 --> 11:49.663
<i>(starts engine)</i>

11:52.011 --> 11:54.571

<i>- (sighs)</i>

12:37.423 --> 12:41.553
- Ahem. You don't look evil.
- Makeup helps.

12:41.627 --> 12:45.996
- Hmm. Where's my mom?
- Had to see friends.

12:46.065 --> 12:47.794
Oh, right.

12:47.867 --> 12:53.601
Did you hear the one where she's stopped smoking,
drinking and hating herself, too?

12:55.040 --> 12:56.871
<i>(sighs)</i> Rachel...

13:06.152 --> 13:08.416
I'm hungry.
Got anything with sugar?

13:08.487 --> 13:10.887
You're five hours late.

13:10.956 --> 13:14.653
My mother dumped me 20 miles out.
I had to walk the whole way.

13:14.727 --> 13:17.628
We eat at six. No exceptions.

13:17.696 --> 13:20.221
You'll have to wait for breakfast.

13:20.299 --> 13:23.132
Oh, there's apples on the table.

13:23.636 --> 13:28.972
Mm. Can I tell you what's really going on?
So we don't get lost in what this really is.

13:29.041 --> 13:31.874
I'd like to know.

13:32.678 --> 13:37.115
My mother and stepfather don't like my life.
Maybe because I have one, who knows?

13:37.183 --> 13:40.744
Anyway, I was stupid enough
to graduate high school in January.

13:40.820 --> 13:46.452
I got into a trouble a few times while I was waiting to
go to college in the fall. So they had to get rid of me.

13:46.525 --> 13:49.187
Banished for the summer in Idaho.

13:49.261 --> 13:53.163
Locked up with the one person on earth
my mother can't jerk around.

13:53.232 --> 13:55.257
That's why I'm here.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.928
Try and jerk me around, Grandma.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.875
Go fuck yourself.

14:11.550 --> 14:14.542
No good night kiss?

14:15.888 --> 14:16.946
OK.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.755
<i>(bell dings)</i>

15:11.777 --> 15:15.907
You know, the only picture
I've ever seen of you is with me in it.

15:15.981 --> 15:18.677
Holding this dog.

15:18.751 --> 15:22.881
I got it for you so you wouldn't be afraid
at your grandfather's funeral.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.185
You named it Grandpa.

15:25.257 --> 15:29.421
I was four. Couldn't you have helped me
pick a name that made some sense?

15:29.495 --> 15:32.089
It made sense to you.

15:33.732 --> 15:36.792
My stepfather promised
to buy me a new car for school.

15:36.869 --> 15:40.100
You know, if I can survive up here,
stay sane.

15:40.172 --> 15:43.801
Oh. So your time here
won't be a complete waste.

15:43.876 --> 15:46.242
Well, I'll miss my friends.

15:46.312 --> 15:51.511
Oh, cheer up. Most friends, in time,
become as useless as relatives.

16:05.230 --> 16:11.226
So, I brought seven novels. If I read them slowly,
that should kill two of the ten weeks that I'm here.

16:12.071 --> 16:14.539
Oh, my God, what is that?

16:15.808 --> 16:18.572
I don't want you
to take the Lord's name in vain.

16:18.644 --> 16:22.102
The f-you lady won't let me say "Oh, my God"?
Got any sugar?

16:22.181 --> 16:24.741
I will not tolerate blasphemy.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.379
And the next time,
I want you to sleep upstairs.

16:28.454 --> 16:32.254
- What if I want to take a nap?
- Upstairs. Georgia rule.

16:32.324 --> 16:34.519
God, lady, you are weird.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.558
I will wash your mouth out next time.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.865
No wonder Mom hates you.

16:46.238 --> 16:49.207
I'm glad you're here, Rachel.

16:54.213 --> 17:00.345
So, do you guys have anything better
around here than Harlan Wilson?

17:01.353 --> 17:03.583
Keep your dress on. I got you a job.

17:04.356 --> 17:06.654
- A what?
- It starts Monday.

17:06.724 --> 17:09.751
Just a brisk walk from here.
I'll wake you at seven.

17:09.828 --> 17:12.661
- I'm not working.
- One more rule.

17:12.731 --> 17:16.723
- You live here, you work.
- OK...

17:16.801 --> 17:21.829
I know that you pulled your "Georgia rule" bullshit
with my mother before she fled.

17:21.906 --> 17:25.172
But I'm not her.
And you can't tell me what to do.

17:25.243 --> 17:27.973
Rachel rule.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.345
Wash your dishes.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.611
Are you asking or telling?

17:32.684 --> 17:35.551
You finished, wash your dishes.

17:41.560 --> 17:44.757
I've never really washed a dish before.

17:50.969 --> 17:53.597
<i># Oh, I see a sunny sky</i>

17:55.441 --> 17:57.341
<i># Everytime I look into...</i>

17:57.409 --> 18:01.004
Morning. How are you?
Have you been practicing?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.311
<i># ...my friend</i>

18:04.383 --> 18:07.580
<i># Stayin' together till the end</i>

18:07.653 --> 18:11.953
<i># It's gonna be a lovely day</i>

18:12.024 --> 18:13.855
<i># It's gonna</i> be...

18:13.926 --> 18:17.157
I don't know if I can afford this one.
It's for Izzy.

18:17.229 --> 18:20.596
I'm trying to find something easier on his back.
I saw something...

18:20.666 --> 18:25.694
<i># It's gonna be a lovely day</i>

18:28.574 --> 18:29.632
Hey.

18:31.910 --> 18:34.970
- Morning.
- Morning.

18:35.047 --> 18:37.277
- Morning.
- Morning.

18:37.349 --> 18:38.816
<i># ...a lovely day</i>

18:38.884 --> 18:44.754
<i># It's gonna be a lovely day</i>

18:44.823 --> 18:47.951
Surprise.
Saddling up your truck?

18:48.026 --> 18:51.962
I had it figured
that you'd done away with Simon,

18:52.030 --> 18:55.864
buried his body and taken off for the city
with his cash and car.

18:55.934 --> 18:58.095
And leave you alive?

18:58.470 --> 19:00.938
Just how disturbed are you?

19:01.006 --> 19:03.634
I prefer "unique."

19:03.709 --> 19:06.678
- How old are you, anyway?
- Old enough.

19:07.679 --> 19:10.170
- Old enough for what?
- To disturb you.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.683
You're a dangerous girl, aren't you?

19:14.753 --> 19:17.119
It depends on what you consider dangerous.

19:17.189 --> 19:19.817
Safer to get thrown from a horse.

19:19.892 --> 19:24.955
Well, you don't have to brush or feed me
after riding me.

19:25.030 --> 19:27.021
<i>(bell chiming)</i>

19:31.303 --> 19:34.272
- I got a girl.
- <i>(dog barks)</i>

19:37.109 --> 19:39.441
Have a good day, cowboy.

19:39.511 --> 19:41.502
<i>(drums beating)</i>

19:45.184 --> 19:47.846
Fourth of July picnic this Saturday.

19:47.920 --> 19:50.320
Bring the family.

19:50.389 --> 19:54.189
- Mandy, stop us.
- Mark time. March.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.558
- Who is that?
- I don't know.

19:57.629 --> 20:00.530
Not from around here.
Move us.

20:00.599 --> 20:02.692
Forward, march.

20:02.768 --> 20:05.066
Fourth of July picnic this Saturday.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.163
Music and games.
Petting zoo for the kids.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.676
Pet a cow. Squeeze a pig.
Milk a goat.

20:11.743 --> 20:13.734
<i>(dog barks)</i>

20:16.915 --> 20:18.644
Hello?

20:18.717 --> 20:22.209
Hi. I'm here to tell you
that I won't be working here.

20:22.287 --> 20:26.485
Oh, Georgia called me about you.

20:26.558 --> 20:30.722
- Well, aren't you a pretty little thing?
- Fern. Fern.

20:31.863 --> 20:36.766
I'Iljust be a moment, dear.
If you'll stay with the phone...

20:37.469 --> 20:43.601
Very good, Violet. We don't want any accidents,
it confuses the animals. Come along.

20:43.675 --> 20:47.441
The bathroom's right in here,
you know that, Violet.

20:47.512 --> 20:48.877
<i>(man)</i> I'm all right.

20:48.947 --> 20:51.415
No lifting, Izzy.
I'm telling you, I mean it.

20:51.483 --> 20:54.577
You're not a weightlifter.
<i>(gibberish)</i>

20:54.653 --> 20:56.382
- How do you say?
- <i>(Izzy laughs)</i>

20:56.455 --> 21:00.414
Hearing the Basque language makes me feel better,
especially when I'm in pain.

21:00.492 --> 21:05.794
Hear me as your doctor. I'm telling you, no lifting.
No feedbags, no hay bales, no more cows.

21:05.864 --> 21:09.459
- I have to lift. I'm Basque.
- You're a Basque with a hernia.

21:09.534 --> 21:12.560
- No lifting, not even your own hat.
- All right...

21:12.638 --> 21:16.438
Ahem. Hi. I'm the new office girl.

21:17.509 --> 21:19.500
You're Lilly's daughter?

21:19.578 --> 21:24.948
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I am Istegui Argitalexei Sarronainda.

21:26.184 --> 21:29.119
- But you can call me Izzy.
- Mm.

21:29.187 --> 21:31.587
- Better.
- And you?

21:31.657 --> 21:34.421
- I'm Rachel. From California.
- Ah...

21:34.493 --> 21:36.620
California -
the land of fruits and nuts.

21:36.695 --> 21:38.026
<i>(chuckles)</i>

21:38.096 --> 21:41.691
- Signing out.
- I mean it. Let Harlan do your lifting.

21:43.001 --> 21:45.993
- You know Harlan?
- Yes. Hardest worker I've ever had.

21:46.071 --> 21:48.266
He lifts like a Basque.

21:48.340 --> 21:54.438
You tell Harlan that if he's up for a little danger,
then I'd really love a ride.

21:58.116 --> 21:59.777
OK.

21:59.851 --> 22:03.446
I will do that. Nice to meet you, Rachel.
Simon.

22:03.522 --> 22:05.513
- Slowly.
- Slowly, slowly...

22:09.895 --> 22:12.796
- You are the anti-Christ.
- <i>(door closes)</i>

22:12.864 --> 22:16.960
Violet Seymoure
is in the examination room for you, Doctor.

22:17.035 --> 22:19.230
- Isn't she a beauty?
- Well...

22:19.304 --> 22:21.272
- Same as Lilly.
- Sure.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.137
Yeah, mm-hmm.

22:24.876 --> 22:28.243
- He treats people?
- Unofficially.

22:28.313 --> 22:32.977
Oh, this is such a relief,
knowing Simon won't be alone.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.714
He's a veterinarian.
It's illegal, what he does.

22:37.155 --> 22:39.646
They'd yank his license.

22:39.725 --> 22:43.559
- What's that you're reading?
- Oh, just a book of poetry.

22:45.030 --> 22:51.128
"The hounds of the crimson sky gave tongue,
but never a cry gave he."

22:51.203 --> 22:54.764
- That's Ezra Pound, the poet.
- Born right here in Idaho.

22:54.840 --> 22:58.105
Oh, but you probably
wouldn't know about that.

22:58.176 --> 23:01.577
I'll be back the first Tuesday in August.

23:02.647 --> 23:04.945
- In August?
- <i>(phone rings)</i>

23:12.824 --> 23:15.987
Ethan, Sam, this is Rachel, my...

23:18.029 --> 23:19.189
granddaughter.

23:19.264 --> 23:22.233
- Do we have to like her?
- How old is she?

23:22.300 --> 23:24.894
No, and forget about it.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.700
I was just asking a question.

23:32.444 --> 23:34.503
You could offer us some.

23:34.579 --> 23:36.911
The kids are thirsty, too.

23:38.283 --> 23:40.717
Want a sip?

23:40.786 --> 23:43.880
I gotta finish here.

23:47.993 --> 23:51.121
- How was work?
- I should have his license pulled.

23:51.196 --> 23:55.257
We saw a pit bull and a peeing woman
all in the same day.

23:58.703 --> 24:02.002
Are you anywhere near ashamed,
making these little boys work like this?

24:02.073 --> 24:03.506
- Let me do it.
- No.

24:03.575 --> 24:05.805
- I'm trying to help you.
- I can do it.

24:05.877 --> 24:07.811
- Just let me...
- I'll do it.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.006
Tell him to let me...

24:10.081 --> 24:13.448
- Get him off of me. Brat.
- Hey.

24:14.352 --> 24:16.343
Stop. <i>(whistles)</i>

24:16.421 --> 24:19.686
- No fighting.
- Get him off of me. I didn't start it, he did.

24:19.758 --> 24:21.658
- You started it.
- Shut up.

24:21.726 --> 24:24.695
Punch her, Sam. Pull her hair.

24:25.764 --> 24:28.392
- Gather your senses.
- Oh, my God.

24:28.467 --> 24:31.231
Oh, my God. You're hard.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.795
You had ample warning
about the Lord's name.

24:34.873 --> 24:39.207
Dude, it was a fight.
You don't pull a boner in a battle.

24:41.780 --> 24:44.112
Go back and hit her, Sam.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.147
- In your mouth.
- What?

24:50.222 --> 24:54.249
Are you serious? The kid gets stiff on my leg,
and I can't use the Lord's name?

24:54.326 --> 24:58.729
- You cannot use the Lord's name...
- She's trying to get me to eat soap.

24:58.797 --> 25:03.825
No, give it to someone else. You guys
want some soap? She's giving out free soap.

25:03.902 --> 25:05.130
Bye.

25:06.404 --> 25:09.498
Ah, she was raised in California.

25:17.449 --> 25:20.179
No, no. Honey, honey, don't, no.

25:20.252 --> 25:26.248
Fingers are for holding the fork,
the fork is for feeding your mouth. Georgia rule.

25:45.977 --> 25:48.275
Happy?

25:53.919 --> 25:57.013
Paula Richards,
Rachel Wilcox my granddaughter.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.282
Mm.

25:58.356 --> 26:01.917
Georgia's been so excited about your visit.

26:03.895 --> 26:05.954
What now, Grandma?

26:06.031 --> 26:08.397
You can take it out.
Grab a chair.

26:08.833 --> 26:11.199
Thanks.

26:11.770 --> 26:14.739
<i>(Rachel spits and coughs)</i>

26:18.543 --> 26:19.567
Hey.

26:22.080 --> 26:24.344
I'm done.
May I be excused?

26:24.416 --> 26:26.077
Yeah.

26:27.452 --> 26:31.786
Would you go out and get us some ice cream?
There's money in the jar.

26:31.856 --> 26:36.816
- Rachel is working for Simon.
- So I heard. That's great.

26:36.895 --> 26:39.295
So, is he queer, or what?

26:40.265 --> 26:43.200
Simon is Paula's brother.

26:44.703 --> 26:49.299
He lost his wife and son in a car accident
three years ago, and it takes time.

26:54.579 --> 26:57.946
For a smart girl, you're good at stupid.

27:07.692 --> 27:11.526
- Dog comes up out of nowhere.
- OK. Yeah. Rachel...

27:12.530 --> 27:15.727
I would have shot him,
if he hadn't taken a piece of me.

27:15.800 --> 27:19.497
Please, don't shoot a dog.
I'd have to deal with that.

27:19.571 --> 27:23.234
You'll be all right soon.
Bring a cushion to the barbecue, though.

27:23.308 --> 27:26.800
- The peeing lady's back.
- Every week.

27:26.878 --> 27:30.507
My... Georgia wants me to help her out for the
Fourth of July barbecue tomorrow,

27:30.582 --> 27:32.641
so I'm gonna take off.

27:32.717 --> 27:36.278
First, there's some gauze in my office.
Will you bring that to me?

27:36.354 --> 27:39.721
- Yeah. Sorry.
- That should do.

27:40.458 --> 27:41.652
<i>(man)</i> All right.

27:44.462 --> 27:49.331
Is it in there? Harold, can you
get that tape started?

27:49.401 --> 27:52.564
- I'm having trouble with that.
- I can't find the end of it.

27:52.637 --> 27:56.300
Me, neither. Both of us need glasses.

27:56.374 --> 27:58.069
- Find it?
- Yeah.

27:58.143 --> 28:02.477
<i>(Harold)</i> I used to have 20-20.
See anything in the dark.

28:03.214 --> 28:05.546
<i>(Harold)</i> Is that gonna scar?

28:05.617 --> 28:07.414
<i>(Simon)</i> Uh... yeah.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.476
<i>(band plays)</i>

28:16.628 --> 28:19.153
<i>(applause)</i>

28:19.230 --> 28:21.221
<i>(band plays new tune)</i>

28:25.236 --> 28:28.501
- Peach, cherry or apple?
- Which one would you like, Troy?

28:28.573 --> 28:32.168
- I'll try the peach.
- Yeah!

28:32.243 --> 28:34.404
<i>(vendor)</i> Hamburgers, hot dogs!

28:34.479 --> 28:37.937
Mrs. Seymoure,
is the music too loud for you?

28:38.016 --> 28:40.712
You wanna move back, over...?
No?

28:41.653 --> 28:42.847
<i>(woman)</i> Hi, Bonnie.

28:42.921 --> 28:44.912
<i>(man speaks Spanish)</i>

28:46.057 --> 28:47.922
- Nice shot.
- Yeah.

28:47.992 --> 28:50.187
<i>(man yells)</i>

28:50.261 --> 28:52.252
- See you later, Simon.
- Bye.

28:52.330 --> 28:54.321
She'd be cute for you.

28:54.399 --> 28:57.334
She just likes me
'cause I just neutered her dog.

28:57.402 --> 28:59.836
That's nice.

28:59.904 --> 29:02.270
What about the music teacher?

29:02.340 --> 29:06.208
No, she's my landlord.
I can't date my landlord.

29:07.445 --> 29:11.381
Georgia sent over a plate
and some pie for you.

29:11.449 --> 29:14.714
You didn't alter it?
Poison it?

29:15.687 --> 29:21.216
That's Bach. She's playing Bach.
I was expecting some ass-kicking country music.

29:21.292 --> 29:24.056
We have our cultural side.

29:24.129 --> 29:27.098
Couldn't tell from Harlan.

29:32.670 --> 29:37.232
In a few months, he's going on a mission
for the Mormon Church.

29:37.308 --> 29:40.641
- I'm not stopping him.
- No, but you could.

29:42.547 --> 29:46.506
- Are you one?
- My sister and nephews are.

29:46.584 --> 29:49.052
I'm taking a little break.

29:49.120 --> 29:52.385
- And Georgia?
- Not a Mormon.

29:52.457 --> 29:55.119
But she pushes a lot of their family values.

29:55.193 --> 29:58.185
People do what they wanna do.

29:58.263 --> 30:00.959
Sometimes what they don't.

30:03.168 --> 30:06.467
I'm not sure Harlan could survive you.

30:07.405 --> 30:12.900
Ach, come on. Don't preach to me
about what I can and can't do.

30:12.977 --> 30:15.309
Or I will poison you.

30:16.314 --> 30:18.748
Anybody can do anything to anyone.

30:19.751 --> 30:23.346
Can't stop what's done to you.
Can only survive it.

30:23.421 --> 30:25.446
Oh, please.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.286
You're 17.

30:27.358 --> 30:32.796
So you're a prisoner of Idaho. I feel for you.
You don't have a clue about surviving.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.525
And you invented it, didn't you?

30:37.602 --> 30:39.627
We can all tell.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.797
The survivor.

30:41.873 --> 30:47.140
You wear it so well in your walk,
in your face, in your eyes.

30:48.513 --> 30:51.004
You've got a dead wife
and a dead baby.

30:51.082 --> 30:54.745
And we're all so proud
you're still even here.

30:58.189 --> 31:04.526
Do you know I was 12 years old when
my stepfather first started having sex with me?

31:04.596 --> 31:08.726
I loved him.
He was nice to me.

31:08.800 --> 31:11.030
We can all survive, Simon.

31:11.102 --> 31:14.663
You just don't have to be
so damn sad doing it.

31:26.184 --> 31:28.914
Hey, Rachel. Take a shot.

31:29.387 --> 31:32.151
Three, two, one.

31:32.223 --> 31:34.714
Good shot, Rachel.

31:36.761 --> 31:40.822
Sorry, we're out of peach.
How about some rhubarb?

31:43.201 --> 31:45.999
My girl's name is June.

31:47.171 --> 31:49.162
<i>(tune playing over iRod)</i>

31:53.845 --> 31:56.905
- Whoa. What? Huh?
- Her name's June.

31:58.983 --> 32:01.144
Is she pretty?

32:03.087 --> 32:05.180
I've known her all my life.

32:05.256 --> 32:07.781
I've never thought of
what you might think of her.

32:07.859 --> 32:11.625
We'd said we'd get married
back in sixth grade,

32:11.696 --> 32:14.563
and we will.

32:14.632 --> 32:19.467
Simon says you might be
going on a mission for the Mormons.

32:19.537 --> 32:23.098
Yeah. I'm looking forward to it.

32:23.174 --> 32:26.143
I'm not looking forward
to cutting all my hair off.

32:26.210 --> 32:29.509
It's gotta be above the ears for the mission.

32:29.580 --> 32:33.141
Your hair will grow back.
How long do you have to go for?

32:33.217 --> 32:35.845
Two years.

32:35.920 --> 32:37.547
Long time.

32:37.622 --> 32:42.150
- Can you have sex on a mission?

I guess what I said about your wife and kid.

You were right.
They're dead, and it shows on me.

I just wanted to tell you that all that junk
that I said about my stepfather, I made it all up.

- Sympathy vote.
- You did?

35:33.264 --> 35:36.131
I needed to make a point.
I lie if it helps make the point.

35:36.200 --> 35:39.192
I talked to your grandmother
about what you told me.

35:39.270 --> 35:41.738
- Why?
- I didn't have any choice.

35:41.806 --> 35:44.434
- You stupid ass.
- Don't hit me with fish.

Can't you tell what the truth is?
Everybody knows I lie. Nobody believes me.

- I believe you.
- Well, you don't count.

I'm driving to talk to June at her school.
I'd like you to come with me.

- Why?
- The only way outta this I see is to marry you.

39:40.978 --> 39:42.843
- What?
- What?

39:42.913 --> 39:45.245
I gotta tell June in person.

39:45.316 --> 39:49.685
- Why'd you let him in?
- I think this is the only way God'll forgive me.

39:49.754 --> 39:53.121
Oh, Harlan, I gave you a blow job.

39:53.190 --> 39:55.385
It wasn't even a date.

39:55.459 --> 39:57.859
I'll wait for you in the truck.

Meditation is the pathway
to your silent energy,

40:16.213 --> 40:20.843
and by harnessing your silent energy
you will overcome your fear of flying.

40:20.918 --> 40:25.912
This is John Gordon. I wanna let you know
that each day you can fuel up with silent energy

40:25.990 --> 40:32.088
to improve your health, increase your energy,
reduce your stress and enhance your happiness.

40:32.163 --> 40:39.592
So take a few deep breaths, relax and
allow silent energy to recharge and renew you.

40:39.670 --> 40:43.333
Remember, you're too blessed
to be stressed.

40:53.150 --> 40:58.782
Maybe I was just looking for someone to say no,
and I thought you were it.

40:59.190 --> 41:04.890
But you touched me, and, you see,
that gives me the right to do anything.

41:06.497 --> 41:09.989
- You were supposed to be religious.
- I should have said no.

41:10.067 --> 41:12.535
If you could just... I have to repent.

41:12.603 --> 41:17.063
- Repent for what? That's retarded.
- If you could just forgive me, everything...

41:17.141 --> 41:20.110
OK. Harlan, you're forgiven.

41:20.177 --> 41:21.838
Forgiven.

She's a destructive liar.

42:12.062 --> 42:17.625
- Why are you here, Lilly?
- Arnold denied it. I asked him flat out.

42:17.701 --> 42:19.794
Never happened. Never happened.

42:19.870 --> 42:23.863
She's paying me back for banishing her out here.
It's as simple as that.

42:23.941 --> 42:27.900
- Then why are you here?
- I'm here to choke the truth out of her.

42:27.978 --> 42:31.345
Why do you think I'm here?
Where would you be?

She's supposed to be leaving for college,
but who knows now,

42:34.652 --> 42:37.177
'cause she lied about sending
the application papers to Vassar,

42:37.254 --> 42:41.918

June, I want you to meet my friend Rachel.
She works for Dr. Ward across the street.

And, well, you know Mrs. Randall over on Hillview.
This is her granddaughter visiting from California.

- Hi.

- That's what this is about, actually.
- On the mouth?

44:48.118 --> 44:51.281
No. I wouldn't do that. Not on the mouth.

44:52.556 --> 44:55.616
What does this mean, Harlan?

44:55.693 --> 44:57.354
Nothing.

44:57.428 --> 45:02.832
That's what this means. June, I just wanted to
come down and be 110% honest about all of this...

45:02.900 --> 45:09.464
Just... Listen, the truth is, I took advantage of him,
OK? He had nothing to do with it.

45:09.540 --> 45:15.035
I mean, I kissed him. And he wanted to make sure
that nothing came between the two of you.

45:15.112 --> 45:18.741

and we're just friends.

- Yeah, that's it.

51:29.519 --> 51:31.510
I'm proud of you.

51:41.832 --> 51:45.393
Yes, such a happy morning.

51:45.469 --> 51:49.735
Yes, I have to cut your nails. Yes, I do.

51:49.806 --> 51:53.139
They're getting a little long.

51:57.647 --> 51:59.080

52:14.598 --> 52:16.964
When did it start?

52:17.033 --> 52:19.934
- When I was 12.
- When did it stop?

52:22.772 --> 52:25.832
When a friend of mine
threatened to kill him.

52:25.909 --> 52:28.343
That's when I was 14.

52:28.411 --> 52:33.940
He bought me the Mustang on the condition
that I start again, so I crashed it.

52:34.017 --> 52:36.781
Rachel? Ha-

52:38.722 --> 52:41.589
Ham and cheese. One's for Simon.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.649
Here you go.

52:45.629 --> 52:47.620
Yeah, have a nice day.

52:55.172 --> 53:00.132
If you're not in for breakfast in 15 minutes,
you'll have to wait for lunch.

53:03.713 --> 53:05.704
<i>(chirping)</i>

53:18.762 --> 53:20.855
Let's go, kids. It's open.

53:22.399 --> 53:24.526
Go like this. Ready? Hold my hand.

53:24.601 --> 53:29.163
You go like this. A circle.
You can use other colors.

53:29.239 --> 53:31.673
- Good. That's pretty.
- Thanks so much, Rachel.

53:31.741 --> 53:36.940
- Oh, you're welcome.
- We will not bite Mommy's ear again, will we? No.

53:37.013 --> 53:39.777
- Bye. Thanks.
- Bye. Good to see you.

53:40.650 --> 53:44.746
- Thanks, Mr. Wells. I'm sure we'll see you again.
- Thank you, Doc.

53:44.821 --> 53:46.618
Hello.

53:46.690 --> 53:48.920
That is $25, sir.

53:48.992 --> 53:51.984
No. Doc usually just sends me a bill
now and then.

53:52.062 --> 53:56.260
Unless you've made prior arrangements,
then it's $25, today.

53:56.900 --> 54:01.064
- Where's Fern?
- She's on vacation. I'm not really sure.

54:01.137 --> 54:02.798
Cash or check?

54:02.872 --> 54:08.071
- This is not the way we usually do it around here.
- Well, I'm new.

54:08.144 --> 54:10.339
It shows.

54:10.413 --> 54:13.780
I've written "paid in full" on your receipt.

54:13.850 --> 54:19.880
I'll let you take these as a reminder.
They're copies of your previous unpaid bills.

54:19.956 --> 54:22.447
- When's Fern coming back?
- No idea.

54:22.525 --> 54:25.858
- I'll send you a weekly reminder until they're paid.
- Thank you.

54:25.929 --> 54:28.659
- Welcome.
- I'm not happy, Andy.

54:28.732 --> 54:30.723
Have a good day.

54:31.701 --> 54:38.072
Amazing. I haven't got a nickel out of him
in four years, and you get $25 in two minutes.

54:38.141 --> 54:39.631
I'm good at getting.

54:40.243 --> 54:42.575
- I'll be right with you, Mr. Lynwood.

54:52.255 --> 54:54.280
Since college.

54:54.357 --> 54:56.985
It relaxes me. I just play for myself.

54:58.061 --> 55:01.861
- Have you dated since your wife passed away?
- Hasn't entered my mind.

<i>(plucks strings)</i>

55:04.067 --> 55:07.525
- You know, I used to date your mother.
- I know.

55:09.172 --> 55:12.005
In fact, I was crazy about her.

55:12.776 --> 55:15.677
Why didn't you marry her,
save us all the trouble?

55:15.745 --> 55:19.977
Things don't always work out
the way you think they should.

55:20.050 --> 55:22.314
But you know about that.

55:22.385 --> 55:26.617
Wait. That's weird.
So you could have been my dad.

55:26.690 --> 55:28.885
Your dad had a car. I had a cow.

55:28.958 --> 55:32.416
Huh. It's always about a car.
Pizza's ready.

55:34.164 --> 55:36.155
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

55:40.870 --> 55:44.431
At least talk to him long enough
to tell him you're not talking to him.

55:44.507 --> 55:46.372
Just pick up and hang up.

55:46.443 --> 55:49.810
Pick up and hang up,
pick up and hang up and so on.

55:49.879 --> 55:53.212
Do you have anything this size

55:53.283 --> 55:55.683
that's serrated, hmm?

55:55.752 --> 55:58.880
He's got thick skin.

55:58.955 --> 56:00.217
<i>(scoffs)</i> Hmm?

56:05.028 --> 56:07.496
You know what's hysterical about all this?

56:08.431 --> 56:10.763
I signed a prenuptial.

56:10.834 --> 56:13.428
I'm going to end up back here

56:13.503 --> 56:19.203
with nothing and no one,
living in a place I am not welcome.

56:19.275 --> 56:22.073
Who says you're not welcome?

56:22.879 --> 56:24.608
Your face.

56:27.050 --> 56:30.417
At least he'll be in prison.

56:30.487 --> 56:33.320
Arnold is one of the best
criminal defense lawyers

56:33.390 --> 56:35.881
in California, Mother.

56:35.959 --> 56:42.364
He's not gonna end up anywhere but free,
happy, laughing and playing golf.

56:45.435 --> 56:47.426
Go with this one.

56:55.044 --> 56:57.535
So, did you know my real dad?

56:59.716 --> 57:03.345
He was exactly what you wouldn't want
a daughter to marry.

57:03.420 --> 57:07.789
Lilly was angry with everybody, even me,
when she left with him.

57:07.857 --> 57:11.725
- How could you even stand her?
- She reminds me of you.

57:11.795 --> 57:13.786
I know.

57:14.264 --> 57:16.425
There.

57:18.201 --> 57:21.432
- Do you wanna hear something weird?
- Probably not.

57:22.639 --> 57:25.699
When Arnold held me, I hated the sex.

57:27.143 --> 57:31.546
But then, sometimes before,
when he just held me,

57:33.516 --> 57:36.246
I felt loved.

57:36.319 --> 57:39.254
And I... I mean, how can that be true?

57:40.690 --> 57:45.024
Maybe the holding part was love, Rachel.
I'm not sure.

57:46.963 --> 57:49.193
But I know everything else was a lie.

57:54.604 --> 57:57.835
I'm gonna show you the top to this stupid thing
so we can finish it.

57:57.907 --> 57:58.999
- I won't look.
- Here.

57:59.075 --> 58:00.804
I'm not looking.

58:00.877 --> 58:04.643
How can you do a puzzle,
if you don't know what it looks like?

58:04.714 --> 58:10.414
It's like telling you how your life will end.
It makes everything in between killing time.

58:10.487 --> 58:13.513
- Go home.
- I don't wanna go home.

58:13.590 --> 58:16.388
You can't stay here. Good night.

when the person that gave them comes to visit.

59:18.721 --> 59:21.417
I don't keep flowers in the house.

by hair for drinking.

59:41.844 --> 59:45.473
I'm too old. So's your hair.

You don't get second chances.
Don't try and save me. I'm not savable.

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:19.674
Everybody's savable. That's the rule.

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:25.619
Screw your rules. I begged you, "Please, Mommy"
for help at Daddy's funeral.

01:00:25.688 --> 01:00:30.990
And that's when I needed saving, Mother,
but, no, you wouldn't give me a cent.

01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:35.622
- You were drinking.
- I was alone with a four year old. I was scared.

01:00:35.698 --> 01:00:39.156
Arnold saved us. Arnold saved me.

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.863
I wanted you to stay.

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:44.805
I wanted you to die.

Not really.

01:00:54.517 --> 01:00:56.178
Just a little.

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.686
Why do you need to hurt her?

01:01:01.224 --> 01:01:03.590
Because you slept with my husband.

01:01:10.867 --> 01:01:13.358

- I didn't touch her.

- Don't touch me.
- Go to your room.

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:27.782
- Why did you let her start again?
- I can handle it. Leave me with her. Go.

01:01:30.853 --> 01:01:32.844
Let me look.

01:01:35.425 --> 01:01:38.724
- Careful of the glass. Can you get up?
- Mm-hmm.

01:01:38.795 --> 01:01:42.060
- I am getting up. Where we going?
- I'm gonna put you in bed...

01:01:42.131 --> 01:01:44.599

He seems like a pretty calm pig.

Yeah, right now, but then, suddenly, he gets
alljumpy, starts running around and squealing,

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:57.662
and he disrupts the other pigs.

01:02:57.740 --> 01:03:00.334

- Pig stress?

- You're not dressed for a drive.

I'm thirsty, OK? I'm dying of thirst.

01:04:14.750 --> 01:04:19.881
I'm waking up, I can't stand the feeling.
I'm gonna go buy booze, busybody.

- No more drinking in the house. Georgia rule.

I don't care about your rules. Fuck off.

I found some perfume under the sink.

I didn't think you'd mind it.

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:58.076
- I forgot I still had that.
- It's next to your stash of toilet paper.

01:05:58.154 --> 01:06:01.646
- Every time you change a roll, you see it.
- What's the Loch Ness Monster?

- No. Doug?
- What's an elephant?

- "Beasts" for $1200.
- This animal is on the Lopez family coat of arms,

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:50.767
probably because the name Lopez
comes from the Latin for it.

- Kathleen. Yes.

- It was getting in the way of my drinking.

01:07:37.219 --> 01:07:41.622
All I remember are Dad's hugs,

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.419
his laugh.

01:07:43.492 --> 01:07:47.121
After all of it, just good things.

01:07:47.196 --> 01:07:49.187
Well, good.

01:07:49.265 --> 01:07:53.463
Why did you try so hard
to take that away from me?

01:07:53.536 --> 01:07:56.096
- Did I?
- Little things.

01:07:56.172 --> 01:07:59.539
We loved to watch TV together,
so you took it away.

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:03.442
Television was a distraction.
Your grades were slipping.

01:08:03.512 --> 01:08:07.039
Were you afraid how much
Daddy and I were alike?

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:11.450
How much he relied on me?
How little he wanted from you?

01:08:12.388 --> 01:08:17.381
You know, mostly... I was afraid
you'd run off and marry an idiot,

01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:21.692
lose everything you had a chance at,
just like me.

01:08:23.365 --> 01:08:25.629
I blamed you for his drinking.

01:08:26.769 --> 01:08:28.828
Oh. For yours, too?

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:31.337
Yeah.

01:08:34.777 --> 01:08:38.679
You know what I don't understand,
along with all the rest of it?

01:08:38.747 --> 01:08:40.738
I haven't got a clue.

01:08:41.850 --> 01:08:45.343
- If you ever really loved me.
- <i>(scoffs)</i>

01:08:45.421 --> 01:08:46.911
Don't be ridiculous.

01:08:46.988 --> 01:08:51.551
No, I mean, just ever.
It wouldn't have to include right now.

01:08:51.627 --> 01:08:53.685
What do you think the rules were?

01:08:53.761 --> 01:08:59.131
Why would I waste my time
on somebody that I didn't care about?

01:09:00.336 --> 01:09:07.071
Yeah. I can't ever remember
you saying it.

01:09:07.643 --> 01:09:09.634
Well, my parents never said it.

01:09:09.712 --> 01:09:12.475
So how do you know if they did?

01:09:13.782 --> 01:09:15.773
I don't.

01:09:25.928 --> 01:09:30.991
I hate that you bought me so many.

01:09:32.734 --> 01:09:35.328
You gonna drink the rest of them?

01:09:36.505 --> 01:09:37.163
No.

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:07.228
How could I not love you?

01:10:28.023 --> 01:10:28.887
Rachel?

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:31.417
It's just Dr. Ward today.

01:10:32.928 --> 01:10:38.764
- She just needs a little more exercise, more walks.
- You hear that, Bertha?

01:10:38.834 --> 01:10:42.270
Come on. Hey.
Just have to cut out on the snacking.

01:10:44.306 --> 01:10:46.433
Tell her she's fat.

01:10:46.508 --> 01:10:48.373
You are fat.

01:10:48.444 --> 01:10:53.040
See what I told you?
He's a doctor. It's not just me saying it.

01:10:53.115 --> 01:10:55.106
- Thanks, Dr. Ward.
- Sure.

01:10:58.621 --> 01:11:01.112
You look great with short hair.

01:11:06.595 --> 01:11:09.530
- Where's Rachel?
- It's Saturday. I gave her the day off.

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.998
She went fishing with Harlan.

01:11:15.337 --> 01:11:18.170
I need to stop drinking.

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:21.266
I'm in no hurry.

01:11:22.244 --> 01:11:26.044
- How can I help?
- She's pregnant, is all.

01:11:28.484 --> 01:11:32.113
Why don't you wait in the office?
This'll take a second.

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.178
<i>(radio playing)</i>

01:11:37.326 --> 01:11:40.295
She's got that California tan.

01:11:40.362 --> 01:11:44.731
- You think it's real or a spray-on?
- I don't know.

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.934
- It's risky being my friend.
- Well, that's what I was coming around to is...

01:11:51.006 --> 01:11:54.271
maybe we could be more than friends, you know,

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:57.244
if you thought you could ever sort of -

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.976
I don't know -

01:12:00.049 --> 01:12:01.914
love me?

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:08.950
I'm kicking men, Harlan.

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:15.122
No, really. So I guess that's what
I was trying to say - kicking men.

01:12:15.197 --> 01:12:19.531
Yeah, well, I'll be gone for two years
on this mission.

01:12:20.869 --> 01:12:23.463
You can't kick forever, can you?

01:12:25.507 --> 01:12:27.168
I promise I'll write.

01:12:27.876 --> 01:12:32.438
I think they're going. Get on the cellphone.
Call the girls. Let's follow her.

01:12:35.551 --> 01:12:39.851
More kittens.
As if this town needs more cats.

01:12:39.922 --> 01:12:41.913
And that was my last patient.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.685
- <i>(clock chiming)</i>
- Remember the clock tower?

01:12:47.763 --> 01:12:50.994
- I do. Do you?
- Like it was yesterday.

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:53.159
We changed the clock back.

01:12:53.836 --> 01:12:56.168
Yeah, yeah.

01:12:56.238 --> 01:13:01.039
And the whole day,
the whole town was just a mess.

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:04.410
Except you. You weren't a mess.

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:07.040
Anyway, um...

01:13:07.116 --> 01:13:09.448
I need Antabuse.

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:13.447
That makes you violently ill if you drink.

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.717
I already am violently ill.

01:13:18.160 --> 01:13:21.857
I'm going to Rexburg later.
I'll pick some up.

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.921
Thanks.

01:13:25.634 --> 01:13:27.625
Is that all you need?

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:32.500
How did I miss what I missed?

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.970
People get busy.

01:13:37.045 --> 01:13:42.449
Too busy to notice
what your husband is doing to your daughter?

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:44.509
I don't know how you missed that.

01:13:46.488 --> 01:13:48.683
You always tell me the truth.

01:13:49.825 --> 01:13:51.816
Thank you.

01:14:24.693 --> 01:14:27.025
- What was that?
- I'm sorry.

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.522
No...

01:14:31.467 --> 01:14:33.332
Thank you. Thank you.

01:14:34.036 --> 01:14:36.027
I gotta go.

01:15:01.463 --> 01:15:04.159
How long do we have to sit here for?

01:15:05.267 --> 01:15:07.258
Smells like rain.

01:15:08.937 --> 01:15:11.667
OK. Let's do it. Mandy, get ready.

01:15:15.777 --> 01:15:18.075
Give us a break, Grace.

01:15:18.146 --> 01:15:20.137
Let's go.

01:15:22.351 --> 01:15:23.750
Car won't start.

01:15:27.122 --> 01:15:28.316
Whoa. Oh.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:34.520
- She's gonna ram us.
- Oh, my God. Get out. Go.

<i>(truck radio blasting)</i>

01:15:56.818 --> 01:16:00.379
Hi. Want to introduce myself.
Rachel Wilcox. Nice to meet you.

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:03.151
- Grace Cunningham.
- Howdy, girls. How you doing?

01:16:03.225 --> 01:16:08.663
Look, I just drove over to tell you
that Harlan and I, we're just friends now.

01:16:08.730 --> 01:16:12.063
Nothing's gonna happen again.
I promise. Scout's honor.

01:16:12.134 --> 01:16:16.537
So you guys can go and do whatever it is you do,
have your summer fun.

01:16:16.605 --> 01:16:20.041
And tell June that we're apart,
even if we're not,

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.702
'cause nothing's gonna happen,
and whatever's happened has happened already,

01:16:22.778 --> 01:16:25.269
so that's the end of it.

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:29.306
Fine. Then why don't you just go home
and leave us all alone?

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:34.413
OK, I tried to be nice. Let me put this a different way,
'cause you're not getting it.

01:16:34.489 --> 01:16:38.255
If you call me a name,
if you throw something at me ever again,

01:16:38.327 --> 01:16:43.162
if I see you talking to Harlan, yelling at Harlan,
having anything at all to do with Harlan,

01:16:43.231 --> 01:16:47.634
I will find all of your boyfriends,
and I will fuck them stupid.

01:16:49.871 --> 01:16:52.601
OK? Get it?

01:16:53.141 --> 01:16:55.609
Thanks for your time.
Have a good summer.

01:16:56.878 --> 01:17:00.871
- I am gonna pray for her.

Just how badly do you hate me
to have to live with this lie?

I don't hate you.

- You're on private property.
- Hi, Georgia. I'm...

01:18:40.882 --> 01:18:42.782
Just give me a moment, OK?

01:18:46.621 --> 01:18:49.089
I shouldn't have agreed to pass you off

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:52.320
to someone who you don't know
because I didn't have the patience.

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:56.922
I should've taken the time.
I should've been there.

- What am I doing here?
- Yeah.

01:19:04.406 --> 01:19:08.934
You called me to tell me you're leaving me,
and then you hang up?

And you wanna know what I'm doing here?

01:19:13.181 --> 01:19:18.084
If I had touched my daughter,
I wouldn't be here, would I?

- She told me...
- What did she tell you? Huh?

That she wasn't using drugs
when you found LSD in her room? Huh?

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:40.899
That she wasn't stealing from you
when I found your emerald ring in a pawn shop?

01:19:40.976 --> 01:19:44.935
Or that she hadn't been drinking
when she crashed her car?

01:19:46.081 --> 01:19:48.140
How many lies have I told?

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:51.117
Oh, please. You're a lawyer.

01:20:04.633 --> 01:20:05.429
OK.

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:13.830
If this was something I couldn't change -
an accident, an illness - I'd accept it.

01:20:13.909 --> 01:20:17.003
She would not lie
about something like this.

01:20:18.213 --> 01:20:20.272
Would I?

Put this in your mouth,
get in your car, and drive.

01:20:32.394 --> 01:20:36.455
I love your daughter, and I love Rachel,
and I would never do anything...

01:20:36.531 --> 01:20:39.796
- What are you doing?
- You do not take the Lord's name in vain.

01:20:39.868 --> 01:20:42.701
You do not fool around
with little girls. Drive.

01:20:42.771 --> 01:20:45.069
I'm not moving.
I am staying right here.

01:20:47.576 --> 01:20:51.569
- Swear to God, I never touched her.
- Save it for the appeal.

01:20:51.646 --> 01:20:56.310
If you don't put that in your mouth soon,
I'm gonna dismantle your car.

01:20:56.384 --> 01:20:58.352
OK.

01:20:59.821 --> 01:21:02.119
I'm leaving. All right?

01:21:05.427 --> 01:21:10.831
I'll be here until Lilly's ready
to come home to San Francisco, OK?

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.785
What if he's innocent?

01:21:30.852 --> 01:21:34.015
Well, it felt really good anyway.

01:21:42.197 --> 01:21:42.891
Rachel...

01:21:44.566 --> 01:21:45.328
Rachel...

01:21:46.868 --> 01:21:50.133
- Can I talk to you?
- No.

01:21:50.205 --> 01:21:52.435
Can you talk to me?

01:21:55.777 --> 01:21:56.505
Rachel.

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:06.180
I'm at the only motel in this town,
next to the Halfway House Café.

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.521
Lil, just hear me out, please.

01:22:10.558 --> 01:22:15.621
Rachel will get over her anger and take back this lie
one day, but where will you and I be?

01:22:15.697 --> 01:22:20.225
What kind of life will we have led
until that happens?

01:22:20.302 --> 01:22:23.169
I just don't want you to regret not believing me.

01:22:23.238 --> 01:22:27.766
But I need you here with me, now.

01:22:33.515 --> 01:22:35.449
I don't know who to believe.

01:22:37.118 --> 01:22:41.282
You have to believe that
I wanted her to go to rehab, but, uh...

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:47.625
you said no, remember? You said
you didn't wanna get into your own demons, right?

01:22:49.898 --> 01:22:52.526
That's true.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:57.670
- Can I get you anything?
- No, thank you.

01:22:57.739 --> 01:22:59.866
Nothing? No baked potato special...

01:22:59.941 --> 01:23:02.171
- You're just gonna sit there?
- It's fine.

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:05.041
I'll take care of you. Thank you.

01:23:08.149 --> 01:23:12.984
I'll do anything
to show you how much I love you

01:23:13.054 --> 01:23:16.820
and how easy it is for me
to forgive her. OK?

01:23:18.626 --> 01:23:22.687
We'll find our way through this.
I know we can.

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.459
Rachel. Oh...

01:23:26.101 --> 01:23:28.899
I didn't know where you were.
Are you OK?

01:23:30.305 --> 01:23:32.773
I'm fine, Grandma.

01:23:34.509 --> 01:23:39.708
I want you to stay there at Simon's.
And I think probably your mom's gonna call.

01:23:39.781 --> 01:23:43.376
- OK?
- Yeah. OK, I'll talk to you later.

01:23:44.185 --> 01:23:47.586
I have to go. I'm cooking Simon dinner.

01:23:47.655 --> 01:23:49.646

Hi.

01:24:13.515 --> 01:24:16.848
- I need a bathroom.
- OK. Are you OK?

01:24:18.386 --> 01:24:21.355

Right here on the left.

01:24:43.178 --> 01:24:47.877
It's always so much easier to believe what you need
than what you know.

01:24:47.949 --> 01:24:49.940
I need Arnold.

01:24:51.186 --> 01:24:55.680
He has me convinced.
And you have me convinced.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:01.288
He finally got his Ferrari, huh?

01:25:07.969 --> 01:25:10.301
Help me understand.

01:25:11.406 --> 01:25:17.936
I need to just tell you what I feel,
because all I saw was how much you loved him.

01:25:18.012 --> 01:25:20.480
How much he loved you.

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:24.316
How much he loves me.

01:25:27.455 --> 01:25:30.515
And I thought, "How lucky we are."

01:25:31.392 --> 01:25:38.457
I just can't fit what he's done
with who I always thought he was.

01:25:41.569 --> 01:25:43.799
I came to tell you I believe you.

01:25:46.274 --> 01:25:48.208
I like your hair short.

01:25:48.276 --> 01:25:52.007

01:25:53.381 --> 01:25:55.906
None of this is your fault.

01:26:04.392 --> 01:26:06.986
I really did just say it to make a point.

01:26:10.698 --> 01:26:12.529
What?

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:18.297
Simon believed me.
Grandma believed me.

01:26:20.375 --> 01:26:23.276
Mom, I just wanted to see if you did.

01:26:32.921 --> 01:26:35.014
Oh, please...

01:26:37.559 --> 01:26:39.823
I screwed up with Vassar.

01:26:39.894 --> 01:26:44.263
I screwed it all up, and I knew
I wasn't ever coming home again.

01:26:44.732 --> 01:26:47.929
And I wanted both of you
to pay for my mistakes.

01:26:50.171 --> 01:26:54.972
You can be mad at me if you want.
And tell him I'm sorry.

01:26:57.178 --> 01:27:00.045
He's not even angry with you.

01:27:00.114 --> 01:27:02.412
He's ready to forgive you.

01:27:11.726 --> 01:27:14.320

You're welcome.

When my mom was too drunk to cook, I used to
take whatever was in the fridge and put it in a pot.

Same old thing.

Your mom called.
She wants to say good night.

- No.

OK.

Well, good night, then.

No, Mom, not right now.

We can't leave it like this.
We have to talk.

That's the plan?

01:31:58.913 --> 01:32:04.078
Well, if she decides that I'm lying about lying,
then you owe me.

Owe you what?

- I'm not gonna take you to court or anything.
- Oh...

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:16.419
I won't sue you. No newspapers.

01:32:17.031 --> 01:32:20.797
Just write her a letter
saying you're sorry about what you did to me.

01:32:20.868 --> 01:32:23.769
- That's it, huh?
- And a check for ten million.

01:32:24.238 --> 01:32:28.402
Hmm. Oh. Right. That. Of course.

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:33.778
You always bragged about how much you were
worth while we had our "father-daughter time."

01:32:33.848 --> 01:32:36.840
Like that would impress me enough
to think it was all OK.

I really hope you weren't lying.
I hope you're worth 20 million.

01:32:40.388 --> 01:32:44.757
Because if she decides you're a piece of shit,
which you are, she gets ten.

01:32:46.127 --> 01:32:47.924
OK.

01:32:48.329 --> 01:32:50.695

All right, that's enough, Rachel.

01:33:22.964 --> 01:33:27.526

He has a videotape of us.

you win everything. I won't even hold it against you.

- OK.

01:33:57.832 --> 01:33:59.595
You were thinking?

I have a little money saved.

01:34:01.535 --> 01:34:07.201
I'd be glad to pay Rachel's way through college,
you know, if that's ever a problem.

01:34:08.275 --> 01:34:10.903
Or if she doesn't need it,
I could let you have it.

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:15.005
Use it for a down payment on a house,
if that's ever a problem.

He tried to take away all the things
that would let you love me like a friend or a father.

This has everything to do with him.

01:36:19.540 --> 01:36:25.843
This is about knowing the difference between
right and wrong, between the truth and a lie.

01:36:25.913 --> 01:36:28.177
He took that from you.

01:36:28.249 --> 01:36:32.185
And if you can't tell the difference,
then you can't trust anyone.

01:36:34.789 --> 01:36:37.349
And if you can't trust, you can't love.

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:44.797

01:40:14.775 --> 01:40:16.834
Coming.

01:40:19.913 --> 01:40:22.746
Why didn't you answer the phone?

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:24.647
I just woke up.

01:40:24.718 --> 01:40:28.154
Simon's at work already.
Did they leave yet?

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:34.752
I thought I could let it go, but I can't.

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:37.422
Rachel, you lied to her.

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:42.466
I put together a puzzle
without looking at the box.

01:40:42.536 --> 01:40:44.265
- Look at me.
- Why?

01:40:44.338 --> 01:40:47.364
Look at me. You have to tell her the truth.

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:52.606
Simon says I don't know the difference
between the truth and a lie.

01:40:52.679 --> 01:40:55.648
- Can a lie ever be right?
- No.

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.378
And what happens if I tell the truth?

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:02.444
We're gonna press criminal charges.

01:41:02.523 --> 01:41:05.515
But it's gonna take the three of us.
Come on, get dressed.

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:08.425
- What makes you think we'll catch them?
- Well, we'll try.

01:41:08.495 --> 01:41:11.328
Simon and Harlan are in the truck.
She gave me this for you.

01:41:11.398 --> 01:41:13.593
- No, no. Go get dressed.
- OK.

01:41:13.667 --> 01:41:15.464
You can read this on the way. Hurry.

01:41:15.536 --> 01:41:20.564
- What makes you think she'll believe me now?
- We'll make her, you and I.

01:41:24.044 --> 01:41:25.272

<i>(honking horn)</i>

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:35.750
- Maybe I should've driven myself.
- Then I would've been tailgating you.

01:41:37.858 --> 01:41:39.291
<i>(horn blares)</i>

01:41:40.394 --> 01:41:42.419
What's your hurry?

01:41:47.367 --> 01:41:50.928
Sending someone back
for your car is ridiculous.

01:41:51.004 --> 01:41:54.940
I might not even do that.
It's all too much trouble.

01:41:55.542 --> 01:41:59.034
Can't leave your car parked
on some side street in Idaho.

01:41:59.113 --> 01:42:03.777
Pull over. You know you want to.
It's the right thing to do.

01:42:05.152 --> 01:42:07.484
Rachel can have it if she wants.

01:42:09.523 --> 01:42:11.047
- Rachel?
- Mm-hmm.

01:42:12.793 --> 01:42:17.355
You love that car.
You waited eight months for that car.

01:42:17.431 --> 01:42:22.459
I don't hold any of this against her, honey.
I want her to know that.

01:42:23.137 --> 01:42:26.436
<i>(honks horn)</i>

01:42:26.507 --> 01:42:29.237
Come on, let's go. Let's go.

01:42:34.148 --> 01:42:36.116
Pull over.

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:39.243
What? What's the matter?
You sick or something?

01:42:39.319 --> 01:42:42.880
Did you think your Ferrari
would be payment enough for her?

01:42:42.956 --> 01:42:47.086
- What? That's not what this is about.
- Get me outta here. Pull over.

01:42:47.161 --> 01:42:50.790
- Come on, honey. Please.
- Pull over right now!

01:42:50.864 --> 01:42:53.264
All right, all right! I'm off. Stop it!

01:42:53.333 --> 01:42:59.795
Honey, stop. Lilly, stop it!
All right, I'm doing it! I'm pulling over!

01:43:06.413 --> 01:43:08.381
Goddammit, Lilly.

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.910
Talk to me.

01:43:12.553 --> 01:43:14.851
Will you please turn around?

01:43:16.089 --> 01:43:18.387
Turn around!

01:43:19.026 --> 01:43:21.551
All right, fine. Keep walking.

01:43:24.798 --> 01:43:26.823
There's your life.

01:43:26.900 --> 01:43:30.301
Back in Idaho. With your mother.

01:43:37.010 --> 01:43:39.069
She seduced me.

01:43:46.186 --> 01:43:47.778
<i>(screams)</i>

01:43:47.854 --> 01:43:49.481
Naah!

01:43:51.458 --> 01:43:53.119
You lying son of a bitch!

01:43:53.193 --> 01:43:57.527
What did you expect me to do
while you were in your drunken stupor?

01:43:57.598 --> 01:43:59.259
And guess what.

01:43:59.333 --> 01:44:01.096
She enjoyed it.

01:44:04.671 --> 01:44:09.973
You wanna take this to trial?
You go right ahead. I welcome it.

01:44:10.043 --> 01:44:13.410
You're going to jail, you sick bastard.

01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:15.471
<i>(starts engine)</i>

01:44:18.785 --> 01:44:21.447
You can bet on it, pervert.

01:44:32.833 --> 01:44:40.035
"Dear Rachel, my mother always told me the
hardest things to do in life are to trust, to have faith,

01:44:40.107 --> 01:44:42.268
and to forgive."

01:44:42.909 --> 01:44:48.404
"So I want you to hear the strength in my voice
when I say I forgive you,

01:44:48.482 --> 01:44:50.814
because I love you."

01:44:50.884 --> 01:44:53.478
"That simple and that complicated."

01:44:53.553 --> 01:44:59.116
"To forgive is to move forward.
Georgia rule. Love, Mom."

01:45:46.073 --> 01:45:48.268
I'm sorry, Mommy.

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:52.237
Oh, bunny. Oh, bunny.

01:45:53.847 --> 01:45:55.940
I love you.

01:45:59.286 --> 01:46:01.345
I'm so sorry.

01:46:06.193 --> 01:46:08.559
Ms. Randall.

01:46:08.628 --> 01:46:12.758
I think you should know
that I'm in love with your granddaughter.

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:18.430
And, well, when I get back from my mission,
I fully intend to marry her.

01:46:18.505 --> 01:46:20.234
OK.
