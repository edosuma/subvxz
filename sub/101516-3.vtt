02:48.126 --> 02:49.711
Why are you out dressed like that?

02:49.794 --> 02:51.129
Do you think you're at a carnival?

02:54.299 --> 02:57.177
I don't understand.
And I've got no mail for you.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.478
The water cut out in her shower.

03:07.562 --> 03:09.689
Yeah... and last week, it was a fuse.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.817
Why does she break everything?
Can she tell me why she breaks everything?

03:24.829 --> 03:27.749
She's getting on my nerves.
Nothing but problems since she got here.

03:32.003 --> 03:32.837
And in the meantime?

03:49.187 --> 03:51.272
I like coffee.

03:53.691 --> 03:55.026
I like tea.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.446
I like sport.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.242
I like boots.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.411
I like dancing.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.498
And I like Paris.

08:24.921 --> 08:25.922
Cut!

09:08.297 --> 09:09.757
Stop everything, please!

13:22.802 --> 13:26.847
Would you like to go
to Jean-Jacques' party with me?

13:28.224 --> 13:30.518
I would love to.

13:33.729 --> 13:37.483
Would you like to go
to Jean-Jacques' party with me?

13:39.944 --> 13:41.987
I wasn't invited.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.614
Do not be sad.

13:43.697 --> 13:45.825
He is only inviting his closest friends.

18:49.795 --> 18:54.967
Emily has just moved here
from Chicago to work for a marketing firm.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.182
I never get tired of this view.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.042
Work, work...

20:15.756 --> 20:17.007
I am...

20:17.174 --> 20:18.300
a painter.

20:21.428 --> 20:23.388
No... for the buildings.
