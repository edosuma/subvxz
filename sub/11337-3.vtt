00:08.175 --> 00:09.808
PARKER:
<i> Looks like</i>

00:09.809 --> 00:11.442
we got to figure
this one out, huh?

00:11.445 --> 00:12.895
I was under the impression

00:12.896 --> 00:14.346
all the figuring had been done,
Greg.

00:14.348 --> 00:16.181
I've got the slugs, Spike.
We're on our way.

00:16.183 --> 00:17.416
SPIKE:
Ed, the range is short,

00:17.418 --> 00:18.384
and that thing
doesn't shoot straight.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.685
You don't hit him dead-on,

00:19.687 --> 00:21.320
it could be bad for Sam.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.621
Spike, we got no choice.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.256
I mean, why should he live?

00:24.258 --> 00:26.408
Why should he live?

00:26.409 --> 00:28.559
When every day, what he did
kills all of us, Greg.

00:28.562 --> 00:31.330
It kills all of us a little bit
more and a little bit more

00:31.332 --> 00:34.266
and a little bit more till
there's... there's nothing left.

00:34.268 --> 00:35.401
There is something left, Walter.

00:35.403 --> 00:36.668
WALTER:
What?

00:36.670 --> 00:38.270
There's no reason why.

00:38.272 --> 00:40.105
There's just people
in pain,

00:40.107 --> 00:41.407
spinning around
a black hole,

00:41.409 --> 00:43.475
hoping that
somebody, anybody...

00:45.513 --> 00:47.546
...will just
finish this.
Go now!

00:49.483 --> 00:51.483
<i> We could put chili peppers</i>
<i> in her smoothie?</i>

00:51.485 --> 00:53.318
No.
No. Shaving cream
in the locker.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.120
Put shaving cream
in her locker.
Yeah.

00:55.122 --> 00:56.221
That is a great idea.

00:56.223 --> 00:57.389
What, are we
in summer camp?

00:57.391 --> 00:58.824
We gonna short-sheet
her bed next? Come on.

00:58.826 --> 01:00.192
She's a ten-year vet.

01:00.194 --> 01:01.393
She's been hazed by the best.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.578
We got to come up

01:02.579 --> 01:03.762
with something good,
something real good.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.531
Sam, any ideas?

01:05.533 --> 01:07.199
Do we really need to haze her?

01:07.201 --> 01:08.834
I mean, she's not gonna be here
forever, right?
No, but

01:08.835 --> 01:10.468
we want to make her feel like
she's part of the team, right?

01:10.471 --> 01:12.071
We don't know
when Jules is going to be back.

01:12.073 --> 01:13.439
Guys, after the
escort today,

01:13.441 --> 01:15.674
we take all the Kevlar
out of her vest, we fill it

01:15.676 --> 01:18.677
with cream cheese,
then we do the obstacle course.

01:18.679 --> 01:21.747
First time she falls flat on her
face, it's instant hilarity.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.549
You know what?
You're a genius.

01:23.551 --> 01:25.384
Yeah.
All right, Wordy,
get a camera for that.

01:25.386 --> 01:26.552
What are you,

01:26.554 --> 01:28.454
Mr. Mature all of a sudden?

01:28.455 --> 01:30.355
Come on. Who's the guy
that put the pepper spray

01:30.357 --> 01:31.623
in Spike's gear his first day?

01:31.625 --> 01:32.791
Huh?
Wordy.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.093
It's like
you said.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.727
We're not dealing
with some rookie here.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.563
She deserves a chance
to settle in,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.098
make a good impression.

01:39.100 --> 01:41.567
Then you get the boots
with the cream cheese.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.368
Hi, boys.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.405
Morning.

01:46.407 --> 01:48.507
Hey, Wordy, that escort job
we have today--

01:48.509 --> 01:52.111
I could use the shield...
refresher that we talked about.

01:52.113 --> 01:54.113
Okay.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.647
(laughter)
Sure.
Five minutes?

01:55.649 --> 01:57.483
Mm-hmm.
Awesome.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.650
Take your time.
Yup.

01:58.652 --> 01:59.818
Okay.
See you out there.

01:59.820 --> 02:00.886
All right. Gentlemen.

02:00.888 --> 02:02.454
Hmm.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.356
What...?

02:05.493 --> 02:09.228
(siren blaring)

02:09.230 --> 02:11.597
WOMAN:
It's just
that sometimes

02:11.599 --> 02:13.499
you don't really
know what it is

02:13.501 --> 02:15.267
that's going
to set it off.

02:15.269 --> 02:17.569
It could be
a... a song,

02:17.571 --> 02:20.572
or, uh...

02:20.574 --> 02:23.175
something that
she used to say.

02:23.177 --> 02:26.745
But this time, it wasn't,
uh, anything like that.

02:26.747 --> 02:31.884
It was... more
about the loneliness.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.520
(sniffles)

02:34.522 --> 02:35.521
Anyway...

02:35.523 --> 02:36.788
(sighs)

02:36.790 --> 02:39.625
It happened, and now, I move on.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.628
My name is Wendy, and

02:42.630 --> 02:44.463
I miss my
little girl.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.665
But it has been

02:46.667 --> 02:49.668
eight days
since my last drink.

02:49.670 --> 02:53.939
And I'm just very happy
to be here right now.

02:53.941 --> 02:56.208
(applause)

02:57.845 --> 03:00.479
Oh, I'd say you
got our attention.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.214
(both laugh)

03:02.216 --> 03:05.617
Well, I was just trying to throw
you guys off a little bit.

03:05.619 --> 03:07.953
Spare myself the whipped cream
in the boot trick

03:07.955 --> 03:09.488
for a day or two.

03:09.490 --> 03:11.190
Yeah, well,
you know the drill.

03:11.192 --> 03:12.692
You kidding?

03:12.693 --> 03:14.193
Back in vice, I
<i> wrote</i> the drill.

03:14.195 --> 03:16.295
So, you were in vice
for how long?

03:16.297 --> 03:17.496
Four years, two
in undercover.

03:17.498 --> 03:19.498
Hmm.

03:19.500 --> 03:21.600
Apparently, I make a very
convincing meth freak.

03:21.602 --> 03:22.834
Really?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.937
Which I try not to
take too personally.

03:24.939 --> 03:26.705
Yeah, blending in
with those guys.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.840
I don't think
I could do it.

03:28.842 --> 03:31.243
Yeah. You know what
the worst part is?

03:31.245 --> 03:32.511
You kind of

03:32.513 --> 03:33.679
get used to it.

03:33.681 --> 03:34.646
Oh, yeah?

03:34.648 --> 03:36.665
I saw the opening here.

03:36.666 --> 03:38.683
I thought, I want to be a
straight-up good guy, you know?

03:38.686 --> 03:40.319
Mm-hmm.
Sounds pretty
damn nice to me.

03:40.321 --> 03:41.520
Uh, you know what?

03:41.522 --> 03:43.255
It's great.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.957
Okay, thanks, buddy.

03:44.959 --> 03:47.659
All right, we're gonna go over
the brief one more time,

03:47.661 --> 03:49.695
catch Donna up to speed.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.705
It's good to see you.

03:59.707 --> 04:01.807
MAN:
Talk to
you later.

04:01.809 --> 04:03.642
Take it easy.

04:03.644 --> 04:04.776
Wendy?

04:04.778 --> 04:07.279
Thought I might
find you here.

04:07.281 --> 04:09.715
Oh.

04:09.717 --> 04:12.684
Sorry about the wait.

04:12.686 --> 04:14.553
My lawyer's been
all over it.

04:14.555 --> 04:18.390
Just need to sign,
and, uh...

04:18.392 --> 04:20.826
Well, always thought your maiden
name was prettier anyhow.

04:24.898 --> 04:26.898
Uh, look,

04:26.900 --> 04:29.568
nobody's supposed to know
about this, but...

04:29.570 --> 04:32.638
they're flying
him in today.

04:32.640 --> 04:34.606
Who?

04:34.608 --> 04:35.874
What do you mean, who?

04:35.876 --> 04:37.376
DONNA:
<i> The Leslie Spit Killer</i>

04:37.378 --> 04:38.844
is our escort job?

04:38.846 --> 04:41.313
Peter Wilkins, yup.

04:41.315 --> 04:43.682
17 women,
six years.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.617
11 months ago, Homicide's about
to press charges,

04:45.619 --> 04:47.319
and he bolts overseas.

04:47.321 --> 04:48.687
A month ago,

04:48.689 --> 04:50.689
he turns up in a
mental hospital

04:50.691 --> 04:52.457
in Bernburg, Germany.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.660
Admits to everything:
names, dates,

04:54.662 --> 04:56.728
dumping patterns.
LEWIS:
Weren't they holding him,

04:56.730 --> 04:58.297
saying he was too crazy
to be tried?

04:58.299 --> 04:59.665
PARKER:
Yeah, but the legal
wrangling's over.

04:59.667 --> 05:01.967
We say that he gets
a mental competency hearing,

05:01.969 --> 05:03.835
and they fly him over to us.

05:03.837 --> 05:05.337
And we're the welcoming party?

05:05.339 --> 05:06.705
PARKER:
This a joint op.

05:06.707 --> 05:09.541
Us and the Federal
Customs Department, all right?

05:09.543 --> 05:11.710
Our counterpart is, uh,
Delia... Dahlia...

05:11.712 --> 05:12.844
Delia Semple,

05:12.846 --> 05:14.746
with the airport
attachment.

05:14.748 --> 05:15.714
Now, airport

05:15.716 --> 05:17.482
might be in our city, guys,

05:17.484 --> 05:19.318
but on the other side
of customs--

05:19.320 --> 05:20.752
that's international territory.

05:20.754 --> 05:22.854
It's her jurisdiction;
it's her rules.

05:25.025 --> 05:27.025
When did you get back
from assignment?

05:27.027 --> 05:28.810
Your parents
have been calling.

05:28.811 --> 05:30.594
They said that they haven't
heard from you since...

05:30.597 --> 05:31.863
I got nothing
to say to them.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.565
Oh, Walter, come on.
You can't still...

05:33.567 --> 05:35.400
Oh, so, you're
past that, too, eh?

05:35.402 --> 05:38.603
Learn how to do that in
one of your little groups?

05:38.605 --> 05:41.373
Yeah. You should try one
sometime.

05:41.375 --> 05:42.674
It helps.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.743
Yeah. Didn't help so much
last week.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.978
What happened then?
You forget to forget her?

05:48.649 --> 05:52.751
You know, not all of us get
to go off and be a war hero.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.687
Some of us have to stay
right here in the same house

05:55.689 --> 05:58.724
and go by the same school
that she went to every day!

05:58.726 --> 06:00.892
Some of us don't get
to forget<i> ever!</i>

06:00.894 --> 06:02.794
All right. I'm sorry.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.863
(panting)

06:06.033 --> 06:09.668
I know I wasn't there
when you needed me.

06:09.670 --> 06:10.836
(sighs)

06:10.838 --> 06:12.504
There's enough sorries
to go around.

06:12.506 --> 06:15.407
(both chuckle wryly)

06:15.409 --> 06:17.843
Walter, it's taken me

06:17.845 --> 06:20.846
a lot of years and a lot
of bottles to get here,

06:20.848 --> 06:22.681
but you can do this, too,

06:22.683 --> 06:26.017
and you're not losing her
by doing it.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.019
You're moving forward<i> for</i> her.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.822
Every time I close my eyes,
I see her, Wendy.

06:33.160 --> 06:37.596
I-I see her lying on that thing
they slid her out on,

06:37.598 --> 06:39.831
and I hear myself saying,
"Yeah, that's her.

06:39.833 --> 06:43.568
That's my daughter."

06:43.570 --> 06:45.437
Every time I
close my eyes.

06:45.439 --> 06:48.073
That's where you still are,

06:48.075 --> 06:50.542
but I can't be there anymore.

06:50.544 --> 06:52.010
And when you find

06:52.012 --> 06:54.880
that you can't be, either,
I want you to phone me.

06:54.882 --> 06:56.481
Any time.

06:56.483 --> 06:58.884
Even after this. Okay? Just...

07:08.061 --> 07:10.629
ED:
<i> All right, we're gonna meet</i>
<i> at the gate.</i>

07:10.631 --> 07:12.798
The Feds are gonna escort
the prisoner to customs.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.733
Then we are gonna
take custody,

07:14.735 --> 07:16.101
escort the prisoner
to the psychiatric

07:16.103 --> 07:18.136
evaluation. Now,
nobody knows

07:18.138 --> 07:20.872
he's flying in today, so
there's no crowd control.

07:20.874 --> 07:22.174
But if anybody
wants this guy,

07:22.176 --> 07:23.909
they will go through
us to get him.

07:23.911 --> 07:25.844
All right? So let's
keep our eyes open.

07:25.846 --> 07:27.512
Let's gear up,
hit the trucks.

07:27.514 --> 07:29.848
DONNA:
I have lived with,

07:29.850 --> 07:33.185
sold to, bought from scumbags,
but protecting them? Come on.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.053
You got words of wisdom
for that?

07:35.055 --> 07:37.222
WORDY:
Look, as for me,
I get confused,

07:37.224 --> 07:38.890
I just think of my daughters.

07:38.892 --> 07:41.827
And whatever I got to do, I do.

that accused serial killer
Peter Wilkins is being taken

into custody today,

08:53.033 --> 08:54.533

families?

08:54.535 --> 08:55.967
Ma'am, please, just stand back.
Eddy, low profile?

08:55.969 --> 08:58.003
Hey, I followed
every protocol you sent.

08:58.005 --> 08:59.004
This isn't on us.

08:59.006 --> 09:00.972
Right this way, guys.

09:00.974 --> 09:03.942
I know how some of you
must be feeling right now,

09:05.445 --> 09:06.945
but right now,
we have a job to do,

the premises,

10:26.393 --> 10:27.993
Mr. Broder,

10:27.995 --> 10:29.761
by the time we get
Mr. Wilkins into custody

10:29.763 --> 10:31.296
to the time we get him
to that hospital,

10:31.298 --> 10:33.064
he's as exposed
as he'll ever be.

10:33.066 --> 10:35.066
It's five minutes tops.
Five minutes is

10:35.068 --> 10:36.935
a long time to be walking
through that crowd

10:36.937 --> 10:38.136
of people we have
no legal ground to restrain,

10:38.138 --> 10:39.137
who want to kill this guy.

10:39.139 --> 10:41.906
And that's bad
why again?

10:41.908 --> 10:44.943
Look, Mr. Broder,
all kidding aside,

10:44.945 --> 10:48.179
my main concern is for my team
and the job they have to do.

10:48.181 --> 10:49.798
WOMAN:
Agent Delia Semple,

10:49.799 --> 10:51.416
Federal Customs Department
Airport Attachment.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.251
Who's Sergeant Parker?
Right here.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.836
How are you?

10:54.837 --> 10:56.420
Sergeant Parker, I understand
you have a problem,

10:56.423 --> 10:57.856
which means
I have a problem.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.190
No argument there.

10:59.192 --> 11:00.191
Good start.
Solutions?

11:00.193 --> 11:01.259
We were just
discussing those

11:01.261 --> 11:03.061
with Mr. Broder here.

11:03.062 --> 11:04.862
No matter where I move the
crowd to, you've still got

11:04.865 --> 11:06.131
to go past 'em.

11:06.133 --> 11:07.616
He's not wrong.

11:07.617 --> 11:09.100
Once you're through Customs,
there's only one way to go.

11:09.102 --> 11:10.135
ED:
But not through
that crowd.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.937
We take the
prisoner

11:11.938 --> 11:13.738
directly from the airplane;
we have a truck on the tarmac.

11:13.740 --> 11:15.140
Out of the question.

11:15.142 --> 11:16.274
Look, we understand:
tarmac's international grounds,

11:16.276 --> 11:18.343
federal jurisdiction.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.178
You need to hand him off
on our turf; we get it.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.413
Boss, why don't we take him
through Customs

11:21.415 --> 11:24.115
and then double back
to a loading area

11:24.117 --> 11:25.283
and have a truck waiting there?

11:25.285 --> 11:26.718
Our turf,
take custody there,

11:26.720 --> 11:28.153
but we got to keep
that crowd preoccupied

11:28.155 --> 11:29.154
or they'll follow
the truck.

11:29.156 --> 11:30.639
I can give 'em

11:30.640 --> 11:32.123
a little press conference,
a little distraction

11:32.125 --> 11:34.292
while you guys are getting Elvis
out of the building.

11:34.294 --> 11:35.844
So you want to take the prisoner

11:35.845 --> 11:37.395
along a non-vetted route,
through an international area

11:37.397 --> 11:39.230
where he's back
under my jurisdiction,

11:39.232 --> 11:41.299
lie to the press,
and evade the public?

11:41.301 --> 11:44.202
Pretty much.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.203
Pretty much.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.838
Let's make it work.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.906
(dialing phone)

11:47.908 --> 11:50.341
This is Agent Semple.

11:50.343 --> 11:53.344
Superintendent MacLean, please.

11:53.346 --> 11:56.081
Then get him out of the meeting,
how about?

11:56.083 --> 11:58.049
Thank you.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.084
Superintendent,
slight change of plan.

11:59.086 --> 12:01.986
Absolutely necessary,
I'm afraid.

12:10.464 --> 12:12.864
Not a bad vacation
for the guys

12:12.866 --> 12:15.233
who get to fly over,
at least.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.235
Well, if you like
jumping over the ocean

12:17.237 --> 12:19.404
in a metal coffin, sure.

12:19.406 --> 12:22.974
So there's something that you
guys are actually afraid of.

12:22.976 --> 12:23.975
Well, you know what?

12:23.977 --> 12:25.844
We all have our weak spots.

12:25.846 --> 12:28.813
Could be anything--
flying, cats.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.048
It was one cat;
it was mean.

12:30.050 --> 12:31.282
I was there; it was mean.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.751
Well, I'm with you.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.186
Try flying
into Khartoum International.

12:35.188 --> 12:37.255
Everything feels
like a cakewalk after that.

12:37.257 --> 12:38.356
Khartoum, hmm.

12:38.358 --> 12:39.357
Youthful backpacking?

12:39.359 --> 12:40.358
(chuckles)

12:40.360 --> 12:42.344
It was a year ago.
(phone ringing)

12:42.345 --> 12:44.329
Went through a rough time,
needed to get away.

12:44.331 --> 12:45.363
Helped train
local police there.

12:45.365 --> 12:46.431
It was a good experience.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.134
Semple.

12:49.136 --> 12:50.752
Copy.

12:50.753 --> 12:52.369
They're coming off.
All right,
subject's approaching.

12:52.372 --> 12:54.305
Everybody up.

13:03.984 --> 13:06.317
(whistling)

13:06.319 --> 13:08.419
Peter Wilkins?

13:09.923 --> 13:12.457
Peter Wilkins,
I hereby take custody of you

13:12.459 --> 13:14.325
and will transport you
through Customs,

13:14.327 --> 13:15.960
after which time
you will be placed

13:15.962 --> 13:17.462
in the custody of the
Strategic Response Unit

13:17.464 --> 13:20.431
and transferred
to Ossington Mental Hospital.

13:21.835 --> 13:24.803
Let's get this over with.

13:39.886 --> 13:41.886
Hey, Sarge, Roscoe's
trying to get you to...

13:41.888 --> 13:44.022
Not now, Danny,
I'm busy.

13:44.024 --> 13:46.157
Well, he wants you
to go up to Departures.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.092
We're short...
Cover for me.
I'll get you back later.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.093
Sorry, bro, cannot.

13:49.095 --> 13:50.962
They want me down here.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.197
Hey, what's up
with the crowd anyway?

13:52.199 --> 13:53.198
Somebody famous
coming in or something?

13:53.200 --> 13:54.199
I'm down here,

13:54.201 --> 13:56.034
so I'll deal
with it.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.435
Yeah, but they want you...

13:57.437 --> 14:00.138
I am exactly where I
need to be right now.

14:00.140 --> 14:02.106
I'm going to tell Roscoe.

14:04.477 --> 14:06.244
Tell whoever
you want.

14:06.246 --> 14:08.079
You stay out of my way.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.415
Or you're going
to do what, big man?

14:10.417 --> 14:12.483
Bi...

14:15.589 --> 14:17.589
All set, Sergeant.
I'll wait
for your confirmation.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.090
Lewis,
accompany the sarge.

14:19.092 --> 14:20.191
Okay.
Eddie,
that's not necessary.

14:20.193 --> 14:22.060
I'm just making
a statement.

14:22.062 --> 14:24.128
We know the new route.
Those people out there don't,

14:24.130 --> 14:26.097
and if one of them's planning
on taking a run at our guy,

14:26.099 --> 14:28.867
that puts you
in their way.

14:28.869 --> 14:30.134
Okay.

14:30.136 --> 14:32.036
Sorry about that cat thing.

14:32.038 --> 14:33.037
We will talk
about that later.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.906
(snickers)
Diamond formation.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.996
Can I have your attention,
please?

14:57.998 --> 14:59.264
Everyone,
please listen up.

14:59.266 --> 15:01.065
DANNY:
<i> I'm telling you, Volcek is</i>

15:01.067 --> 15:03.401
ten pounds of crazy
in a five-pound bag, okay?

15:03.403 --> 15:04.402
He grabbed me.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.170
His eyes--
Broder, I'm telling you,

15:06.172 --> 15:08.072
I get chills thinking
about those eyes, okay?

15:08.074 --> 15:09.240
Danny, are you high?

15:09.242 --> 15:11.209
'Cause I don't
have time.

15:15.615 --> 15:18.283
PARKER:
<i> Just to let you know,</i>

15:18.285 --> 15:20.018
we will be making
an announcement

15:20.020 --> 15:21.419
in a few minutes.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.553
I beg
your patience.

15:22.555 --> 15:23.588
BRODER:
<i> You see the crap</i>

15:23.590 --> 15:24.689
I'm dealing
with right now?

15:24.691 --> 15:26.090
You think I have time
for your crap?

15:26.092 --> 15:27.158
There he is.

15:28.995 --> 15:30.495
Okay, let's find out.

15:32.465 --> 15:35.333
Coming through the last section,
all clear.

15:35.335 --> 15:38.102
PARKER:
Copy that.

15:42.509 --> 15:45.143
Something's going
on with Broder.

15:47.180 --> 15:50.014
Excuse me, excuse me,
excuse me, excuse me.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.518
Oh, Danny,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.053
get back to work.

16:07.033 --> 16:08.599
(gunfire)
Get down! Get down!

16:08.601 --> 16:10.268
WORDY:
I'm hit!

16:11.404 --> 16:13.738
Team, status, status.

16:20.213 --> 16:22.213
We just took fire.

16:22.215 --> 16:24.048
Who's hit?
Check the prisoner.

16:24.050 --> 16:25.083
Who's hit?

16:25.085 --> 16:27.419
Wordy, Wordy's down.

16:27.420 --> 16:29.754
I'm good. I'm good.
It's in the vest.

16:29.756 --> 16:31.122
Where's the shooter?

16:31.124 --> 16:32.156
No eyes on the shooter.

16:32.158 --> 16:33.291
Prisoner is unharmed.

16:33.293 --> 16:34.592
Are you sure?
Yeah.

16:34.594 --> 16:36.361
Deep breath, Wordy.
Let's go.
Wordy, you okay?

16:36.363 --> 16:38.629
Someone help me up, help me up.
Agent Semple, stop!

16:38.631 --> 16:40.631
Agent Semple is pursuing
the shooter!

16:40.633 --> 16:42.233
ED:
Sam and I got to go.

16:42.235 --> 16:44.068
Negative, you stay
with the prisoner, Ed.

16:44.070 --> 16:45.236
She's got no backup!

16:45.238 --> 16:47.038
Sam, go get her.
Bring her back!

16:47.040 --> 16:49.173
We're going to take
the prisoner to Customs.

16:49.175 --> 16:51.376
Okay, let's do that.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.744
One, two, three.
Let's go, go, go.

16:57.217 --> 17:01.119
Approaching mechanical room,
level 3.

17:08.461 --> 17:10.461
SEMPLE:
Now, this stops now.

17:10.463 --> 17:11.496
WALTER:
That's up to you.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.497
Suspect is cornered.

17:12.499 --> 17:15.566
Need backup immediately.

17:15.568 --> 17:17.468
It's over.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.603
Agent Semple,
take cover behind me.

17:21.174 --> 17:22.707
Go, go, go!

17:22.709 --> 17:25.143
(loud blast over radio)

17:25.145 --> 17:27.712
Sam!

17:27.714 --> 17:28.713
Eddie.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.114
Eddie, backup, now.

17:30.116 --> 17:31.249
Copy that. We're on our way.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.250
SAM:
Negative, negative.

17:32.252 --> 17:35.586
Stand down. Stand down.

17:59.145 --> 18:01.145
Hey, nice phone.

18:01.147 --> 18:04.282
GPS?

18:04.284 --> 18:07.852
Shooter on the loose,
whole area is unsecured.

18:07.854 --> 18:10.121
We protect the prisoner here
until we apprehend the shooter

18:10.123 --> 18:11.856
and get Sam back.
(phone ringing)

18:11.858 --> 18:15.193
Copy.

18:15.195 --> 18:16.627
Agent Semple,
I'm gonna send my guys

18:16.629 --> 18:18.496
to the mechanical room as soon
as we get the prisoner...

18:18.498 --> 18:20.231
No point. They're gone.

18:20.233 --> 18:21.265
Oh, God, I am so sorry, Parker.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.900
You need

18:22.901 --> 18:24.534
to get yourself checked out
after that blast.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.871
I'm getting intel;
I'll be there in five.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.580
Let's get this vest off.
Thanks.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.315
I-I'm fine.
Just give me one sec, okay?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.584
Sir, we need a room with
one entrance and no windows.

18:39.586 --> 18:41.202
You got something?

18:41.203 --> 18:42.819
What about the holding areas
for suspicious entrants?

18:42.822 --> 18:45.223
Got that?
Yes, sir.

18:58.371 --> 19:00.438
That's our communication.

19:00.440 --> 19:01.506
We can all hear each other
with that.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.278
This is
Sergeant Gregory Parker

19:07.280 --> 19:09.680
with the Police
Strategic Response Unit.

19:09.682 --> 19:11.349
Is there someone else
on this line?

19:13.753 --> 19:16.621
(sighs)

19:17.590 --> 19:20.191
Can you tell me your name, sir?

19:21.161 --> 19:23.327
No.

19:23.329 --> 19:25.630
Listen very carefully.

19:25.632 --> 19:27.899
We are going to do
a prisoner swap in 20 minutes.

19:27.901 --> 19:29.233
I'll contact you
with a location.

19:29.235 --> 19:30.268
Okay, can you tell me

19:30.270 --> 19:31.469
if my officer
is all right?

19:31.471 --> 19:32.470
He's fine.

19:32.472 --> 19:34.639
For now.

19:36.276 --> 19:38.576
Eddie.

19:38.578 --> 19:40.945
All right, no communication
except by phone.

19:40.947 --> 19:42.313
Everybody
got that?
Copy.

19:42.315 --> 19:43.347
We need a
different location

19:43.349 --> 19:45.349
for holding,
something secure.

19:45.351 --> 19:47.218
Wordy, you still need
medical assistance.

19:47.220 --> 19:49.287
I'm fine; we
need to get Sam.
Let's go.

19:49.289 --> 19:52.256
I hear you, I hear you,
but with the rounds you took,

19:52.258 --> 19:53.291
you're not running
after anything.

19:53.293 --> 19:54.759
I'm not sitting this one out.

19:54.760 --> 19:56.226
So I'm gonna put you
on protection.

19:56.229 --> 19:57.728
We can't move that prisoner

19:57.730 --> 19:59.730
until we've neutralized the
shooter and secured the area.

19:59.732 --> 20:02.466
We need you, Wordy, we just
need you where we can use you.

20:02.468 --> 20:03.467
Whatever I have to do.

20:03.469 --> 20:04.702
Partner with Wordy.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.837
Yeah, yeah, Spike,
Lewis, you're with me.

20:06.839 --> 20:08.272
Room by room if we have to.

20:08.274 --> 20:10.741
Let's see some floor plans.

20:10.743 --> 20:12.543
PARKER:
Hey.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.878
Hey.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.246
Walter Volcek--

20:15.248 --> 20:17.248
joined custodial
a month ago.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.318
Father of Julie Volcek,
14th victim of Peter Wilkins.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.220
My superiors
have been informed.

20:22.222 --> 20:23.321
We're checking every
security camera, every...

20:23.323 --> 20:24.655
Okay, thank you.
We'll take care of it

20:24.657 --> 20:26.023
from here.

20:26.024 --> 20:27.390
I put the word out
to all our agents on-site.

20:27.393 --> 20:28.392
Our #1 priority is

20:28.394 --> 20:30.294
getting your man back.
Agent...

20:30.296 --> 20:32.363
Parker, he is where he is
because of what I let happen.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.331
No.

20:33.332 --> 20:34.298
No, you didn't let
anything happen.

20:34.300 --> 20:35.433
This guy's a pro.

20:35.435 --> 20:36.901
I'm gonna guess
he's military.

20:36.903 --> 20:37.902
How's that?

20:37.904 --> 20:39.270
He's a great shot

20:39.272 --> 20:40.338
and he grabbed
one of my guys,

20:40.340 --> 20:43.007
and that's a
hard thing to do.

20:43.009 --> 20:45.276
Now, what I'm worried
about is his lack of care

20:45.278 --> 20:47.078
for getting caught
or killed.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.879
That tells me he's desperate,
which means he's dangerous.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.514
Well, don't think
you can afford

20:50.516 --> 20:53.284
to turn down any help,
can you?

20:55.255 --> 20:59.423
Okay, well, we can, uh,

20:59.425 --> 21:02.827
use some help interviewing
staff and protesters

21:02.829 --> 21:07.465
and the ever-so-vigilant
Security Chief Broder.

21:13.273 --> 21:14.772
DONNA:
Let's go.

21:19.312 --> 21:20.711
Over here.

21:21.948 --> 21:23.914
Sit down where I can
see you-- right here.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.318
Don't move.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.619
You okay?

21:28.621 --> 21:29.687
(whistling)

21:29.689 --> 21:30.821
Shut it!

21:32.058 --> 21:33.391
Is it bad?

21:33.393 --> 21:34.625
Uh... no.

21:34.627 --> 21:37.061
It, uh... (sighs)

21:37.063 --> 21:40.364
a rib or... maybe three.

21:40.366 --> 21:42.333
Wordy,

21:42.335 --> 21:44.402
in what universe
is it fair

21:44.404 --> 21:46.671
that we protect that
and you take a bullet for it?

21:47.840 --> 21:49.874
If you got an answer,
I'd love to hear it.

21:49.876 --> 21:51.709
My wife, Shelley,
is going to ask me that

21:51.711 --> 21:53.344
in about three hours.
So, you think

21:53.346 --> 21:54.445
of your daughters now.

21:54.447 --> 21:56.547
What do you want to do to him?

21:59.085 --> 22:01.018
I guess, uh...

22:01.020 --> 22:04.088
I think, when I go home tonight

22:04.090 --> 22:07.091
and I hold my baby girl,

22:07.093 --> 22:09.393
it's got to be with clean hands.

22:10.330 --> 22:11.595
(sighs)

22:13.066 --> 22:14.432
Okay, sit, sit.

22:14.434 --> 22:16.534
Right here--
sit down.

22:24.110 --> 22:26.477
Never seen it so empty before.

22:26.479 --> 22:27.762
That's procedure.

22:27.763 --> 22:29.046
We cleared
the whole area for you.

22:32.518 --> 22:33.751
How are the ribs?

22:33.753 --> 22:35.486
My hearing's a little shot.

22:35.488 --> 22:37.455
Was just a
concussive grenade.

22:37.457 --> 22:39.090
With your, uh...
your body armor,

22:39.092 --> 22:40.424
there shouldn't
be any real damage.

22:40.426 --> 22:41.909
I appreciate

22:41.910 --> 22:43.393
the planning that must
have gone into that.

22:43.396 --> 22:46.030
You obviously don't want
to hurt anyone except...

22:46.032 --> 22:47.665
Well, the plan has changed.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.835
Can't afford to be
so considerate anymore.

22:51.871 --> 22:53.070
(sighs)

22:55.007 --> 22:56.907
Infantry?

22:58.511 --> 23:00.478
Air Force?

23:00.480 --> 23:03.414
Come on,
not Navy, please.

23:04.751 --> 23:06.650
(sighs)

23:06.652 --> 23:07.952
You?

23:07.954 --> 23:09.520
Special Forces.

23:09.522 --> 23:10.421
That figures.

23:10.423 --> 23:12.089
Jumps on a grenade.

23:12.091 --> 23:15.393
Tell all the ladies
what a superhero you are.

23:15.395 --> 23:17.094
Yeah, infantry--
spend all your time

23:17.096 --> 23:18.729
bitching about Special Forces.

23:18.731 --> 23:19.797
(chuckles briefly)

23:19.799 --> 23:21.132
PARKER:
<i> And no flags come up</i>

23:21.134 --> 23:23.467
when his name matches
one of Wilkins' victims?

23:23.469 --> 23:25.870
How is that supposed to come up
in a clearance check?

23:25.872 --> 23:27.138
Oh, I don't know.

23:27.140 --> 23:29.440
It took Semple's guys
30 seconds on Google.

23:30.410 --> 23:31.509
Yeah.

23:31.511 --> 23:34.111
Yeah, so I'm the bad guy.

23:34.113 --> 23:35.413
Meanwhile, these
poor people...

23:35.415 --> 23:36.847
you won't even let
them get a look

23:36.849 --> 23:38.582
at the scumbag
who's off to get, what,

23:38.584 --> 23:40.184
ten years of Ping-Pong?

23:40.186 --> 23:42.553
They don't deserve
that justice, at least?

23:42.555 --> 23:44.054
Who's the bad
guy again?

23:44.056 --> 23:45.489
Huh?

23:47.527 --> 23:49.059
A member
of the victim's group

23:49.061 --> 23:50.795
said they got
an anonymous call this morning.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.997
A male voice said,
"If you want to see justice,

23:52.999 --> 23:54.465
come to the airport today."

23:54.467 --> 23:56.066
Figure Volcek
made the call?

23:56.068 --> 23:58.502
Maybe... but then,
how did he find out

23:58.504 --> 24:00.004
about the flight
in the first place?

24:00.006 --> 24:01.872
How did he get his gun
through employee security?

24:01.874 --> 24:03.507
And who knew
about the alternate route?

24:03.509 --> 24:04.809
Us, you guys...

24:04.811 --> 24:06.844
and Mr. Security there.

24:08.915 --> 24:11.482
Let me have a talk
with our Mr. Broder.

24:14.654 --> 24:16.487
So, prisoner exchange... really?

24:16.489 --> 24:17.721
(chuckles)

24:17.723 --> 24:20.057
Saw it work in the Sudan.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.760
You in SAFARI?

24:22.762 --> 24:25.963
Yeah, it was part of UNMIS.

24:25.965 --> 24:29.533
The Sudanese army,
they had a... bunch of rebels.

24:29.535 --> 24:31.052
They turned them over to us.

24:31.053 --> 24:32.570
Rebels handed over
some of their soldiers.

24:32.572 --> 24:33.671
It all seemed
pretty straightforward.

24:33.673 --> 24:35.473
This isn't Africa.

24:35.475 --> 24:37.041
You got that right.

24:37.042 --> 24:38.608
If this was Africa,
nobody would have a problem

24:38.611 --> 24:41.078
with what I have to do.

24:41.079 --> 24:43.546
You lose somebody you love,
I'm not saying I don't get you.

24:43.549 --> 24:44.849
Get me?

24:44.851 --> 24:47.051
Buddy, don't even try
to pretend, all right?

24:47.053 --> 24:48.152
What I'm saying is,

24:48.154 --> 24:49.520
from an operational
standpoint,

24:49.522 --> 24:50.921
I'm not seeing
the desired outcome

24:50.923 --> 24:53.190
being very likely,
knowing our rules of engagement.

24:53.192 --> 24:55.493
Sudanese had rules, too.

24:55.495 --> 24:58.095
But when the wives and
the children of your soldiers

24:58.097 --> 25:01.866
are crying at your door
every night, the rules change.

25:01.868 --> 25:04.235
People can do things they...

25:04.237 --> 25:06.537
never would have expected.

25:07.273 --> 25:08.839
WENDY:
<i> I don't understand how Walter</i>

25:08.841 --> 25:10.574
<i> could have done</i>
<i> something like this.</i>

25:10.576 --> 25:12.276
I tried to help him.

25:12.277 --> 25:13.977
We... we tried to go
to groups together, and he...

25:13.980 --> 25:15.513
he just... he couldn't do it.

25:15.515 --> 25:16.864
He just couldn't get past it.

25:16.865 --> 25:18.214
PARKER:
There anything else
you can tell me?

25:18.217 --> 25:20.184
Anything that might reach him?

25:20.186 --> 25:21.285
It's just, you...

25:21.287 --> 25:23.220
you feel so alone.

25:23.222 --> 25:24.989
You feel like you're the...

25:24.991 --> 25:26.857
you're the only person
that's going through this,

25:26.859 --> 25:29.593
and if he knew... if he knew
that he wasn't alone...

25:29.595 --> 25:30.694
Thank you, Wendy.

25:30.696 --> 25:32.563
We'll let him know that.

25:35.234 --> 25:37.968
(radio crackling)

25:37.970 --> 25:39.537
Ed, just spoke
with Volcek's wife.

25:39.539 --> 25:41.138
You copy?
Copy that, boss.
What did she say?

25:41.140 --> 25:43.040
PARKER (over radio):
He's a good guy.

25:43.042 --> 25:45.643
He's a loyal soldier.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.044
They had one daughter, Julie.

25:47.046 --> 25:48.979
She was 15
when Wilkins killed her.

25:48.981 --> 25:51.181
There are some
complicating factors, though.

25:51.183 --> 25:54.084
Volcek was on assignment
when it happened.

25:54.086 --> 25:55.719
Julie was with her grandparents,

25:55.721 --> 25:57.588
his folks.

25:57.590 --> 25:58.889
They let her stay out

25:58.891 --> 26:00.024
past curfew.

26:00.026 --> 26:01.625
She never came home.

26:01.627 --> 26:04.828
Walter hasn't spoken
to them since then.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.730
Marriage... well, you know...

26:06.732 --> 26:08.265
you know the stats on that one.

26:08.267 --> 26:10.100
Parents of a murder victim.

26:10.102 --> 26:12.636
I mean, it's all pretty
understandable, you know?

26:12.638 --> 26:14.638
Textbook loser, eh?

26:16.842 --> 26:18.676
I'm not saying
that, Walter.

26:18.678 --> 26:19.777
Why not?

26:20.746 --> 26:23.247
I've lived with it long enough.

26:23.249 --> 26:25.683
Almost done, though.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.354
You know what I want.

26:30.356 --> 26:32.623
And give it to me...

26:32.625 --> 26:34.091
you can have me.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.759
Shoot me-- I don't care anymore.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.161
Okay, but I care.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.029
I care about my guy.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.299
And I do care about
what you're going through.

26:42.301 --> 26:44.368
But I especially care
about ending this

26:44.370 --> 26:45.903
without any more pain.

26:45.905 --> 26:49.607
So, please,
can you help me do that?

26:49.609 --> 26:51.275
Sure.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.611
Come and meet me.

26:53.613 --> 26:56.614
Gate 525.

26:56.616 --> 26:59.249
I'll have your guy;
you have mine.

26:59.251 --> 27:01.251
Okay, but that's going
to take some time, Walter.

27:01.253 --> 27:02.853
Five minutes.

27:02.855 --> 27:05.723
Let's get this over with.

27:07.393 --> 27:09.326
Okay... Spike and Lewis?

27:09.328 --> 27:10.394
Securing level 2.

27:10.396 --> 27:12.396
I'm going to meet them
at Gate 526.

27:12.398 --> 27:14.398
Okay, you're Sierra 1.
ED:
Copy that.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.301
Broder gave himself up.

27:17.303 --> 27:19.236
Says he called in the tip
to the group.

27:19.238 --> 27:21.205
Thinks he was being
a righteous citizen.

27:21.206 --> 27:23.173
He swears up and down he
had nothing to do with Walter.

27:23.175 --> 27:24.375
Just a bad coincidence.

27:24.377 --> 27:26.076
Yeah, uh-huh.
We're keeping
on him.

27:26.078 --> 27:27.711
Nice bit
of talk there.

27:27.713 --> 27:29.713
Sounds like you had him
in the end.
Yeah, well,

27:29.715 --> 27:33.050
we'll see how much
when we show up with no Wilkins.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.420
ED:
<i> I got eyes on both of them.</i>

27:36.422 --> 27:38.255
We're sticking
to hand signals for now.

27:38.257 --> 27:40.391
PARKER:
Copy. If he shows up,
I'll be there in five.

27:40.393 --> 27:42.726
Until then, if he makes
any kind of move on Sam...

27:42.728 --> 27:44.395
Copy that, boss.

27:45.965 --> 27:47.765
Okay.

27:47.767 --> 27:50.234
Okay... okay.

27:50.236 --> 27:52.036
Boss, he's here.
PARKER:
Okay, I'm on my way.

27:52.038 --> 27:54.071
You've got Scorpio
if you need it.

27:54.073 --> 27:55.406
I'll bring my hand up
very slowly,

27:55.408 --> 27:57.107
'cause I'm sure you've
got a sniper on me,

27:57.109 --> 27:59.143
and I want him...
I want him to see this.

28:00.446 --> 28:02.212
What the hell is that?

28:02.214 --> 28:04.448
Boss, we've got
a big problem.

28:04.450 --> 28:05.683
What, you can't take the shot?

28:05.685 --> 28:06.717
No, I can take the shot.

28:06.719 --> 28:09.687
But if I do, I kill Sam.

28:20.466 --> 28:22.833
ED:
He's holding a frag grenade.

28:22.835 --> 28:23.867
The pin
has been pulled.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.402
If I take him out,
he'll take out Sam

28:25.404 --> 28:27.705
and anybody within 20 feet.
WALTER:
If I don't

28:27.707 --> 28:30.207
see Wilkins in five minutes,
I let go. That's it.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.277
Unless somebody's
got a better idea.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.713
"Unless somebody
has a better idea."

28:35.715 --> 28:37.381
Is he talking to us?

28:37.383 --> 28:39.283
Ed, we need Spike

28:39.285 --> 28:41.351
to scan for any nearby
radio receivers.

28:41.353 --> 28:44.088
I think Volcek might be trying
to reach out to someone.

28:44.090 --> 28:45.255
ED:
I can't.

28:45.257 --> 28:47.224
<i> Spike's covering him and Sam.</i>

28:47.226 --> 28:49.359
If Wordy and Donna can switch
with Lewis and Spike...

28:49.361 --> 28:50.928
No, they've got Wilkins.

28:50.929 --> 28:52.496
I'm going to call
for a backup team.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.198
To get here in five minutes?
Ed...

28:54.200 --> 28:56.266
Sergeant, let me help.

28:56.268 --> 28:57.301
Delia...
Least I can do

28:57.303 --> 28:58.902
is help you do your job.

28:58.904 --> 29:00.838
You get your officers
off Wilkins, I'll cover him.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.740
No, no, he's our responsibility,

29:02.742 --> 29:04.374
once you handed him off
officially.

29:04.376 --> 29:06.510
Look, we both know who's
wearing this when it's over,

29:06.512 --> 29:09.213
and I'm ready to face that,
so let me cover for you.

29:09.215 --> 29:10.981
You go, I watch him--
off the books.

29:10.983 --> 29:12.316
Come back,
it never happened.

29:12.318 --> 29:14.351
Let me do this for you.

29:14.353 --> 29:16.253
And me.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.222
Thank you.

29:18.224 --> 29:19.923
Ed, Semple's going to help.

29:19.925 --> 29:21.391
Get your guy.
Bring him back safe.

29:21.393 --> 29:22.826
She'll send Wordy
and Donna your way.

29:22.828 --> 29:23.894
ED:
Copy that.

29:31.771 --> 29:33.370
Hi, Walter.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.439
I'm Greg Parker.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.909
Guess we got to figure
this one out, huh?

29:38.911 --> 29:40.778
I was under the impression

29:40.780 --> 29:43.413
all the figuring
had been done, Greg.

29:43.415 --> 29:45.415
Yeah, I'm going to have
to be honest with you.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.218
I'm not going to be able
to give you what you want.

29:48.220 --> 29:50.220
Spike, I need you to scan
for any kind of radio frequency.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.421
Boss has got a hunch.

29:51.423 --> 29:52.422
What about Sam?
This guy's escalating.

29:52.423 --> 29:53.422
Maybe try for a
hand-to-hand takedown.

29:53.425 --> 29:54.825
It's too risky.

29:54.827 --> 29:56.393
He drops it,
I'll lose you both. No way.

29:56.395 --> 29:58.328
No sniper, no distraction,
no hand-to-hand.

29:58.330 --> 30:00.430
What do we have left?
I'll get the slug.

30:00.432 --> 30:02.332
It's a long shot, I know,
but it's all we've got.

30:02.334 --> 30:03.367
PARKER:
<i> You want to tell me</i>

30:03.369 --> 30:05.068
what this is
all about, then?

30:06.038 --> 30:09.306
I just, uh...

30:09.308 --> 30:12.576
to be honest, Greg...

30:12.578 --> 30:15.145
I just need some time here.
Okay.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.281
You want time? You want
to explain that to me?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.349
I can't explain it to you, Greg,
'cause you don't know.

30:19.351 --> 30:20.918
Nobody knows.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.253
People who say they do know...
they're the worst.

30:23.255 --> 30:25.389
All these people,
they say they want

30:25.391 --> 30:28.225
to help you, they just don't
leave you alone, you know?

30:28.227 --> 30:31.295
But you got to be alone
to understand why.

30:31.297 --> 30:32.596
Right?

30:33.566 --> 30:35.399
ED (over radio):
I've got the slug.

30:35.401 --> 30:36.934
Spike, we're on our way.

30:36.936 --> 30:39.436
SPIKE:
You've got to be
really careful, okay?

30:39.438 --> 30:41.538
It will do the job:
it will paralyze on contact,

30:41.540 --> 30:43.207
but Ed, the range is short,

30:43.209 --> 30:44.441
and that thing
doesn't shoot straight.

30:44.443 --> 30:46.476
You don't hit him dead-on,
it could be...

30:46.478 --> 30:47.911
it could be bad for Sam.

30:47.913 --> 30:49.479
Spike, we've got no choice.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.481
Why should he live,

30:51.483 --> 30:54.318
when every day, what he...

30:54.320 --> 30:56.453
what he did...

30:56.455 --> 30:59.122
kills all of us?

30:59.124 --> 31:01.391
It kills all of us, Greg,
a little bit more

31:01.393 --> 31:03.460
and a little bit more
and a little bit more

31:03.462 --> 31:04.828
until there's nothing left.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.195
There is something left, Walter.

31:06.198 --> 31:07.397
What?

31:07.399 --> 31:08.532
What's left, Greg?

31:08.534 --> 31:10.400
What's always
been there.

31:10.402 --> 31:11.935
Family.

31:11.937 --> 31:13.437
Your family...

31:13.439 --> 31:16.006
who still needs you,
no matter what.

31:16.008 --> 31:17.941
Family.

31:23.282 --> 31:27.517
Let me tell you a little bit
about my family, Greg.

31:30.456 --> 31:33.290
I have a...

31:33.292 --> 31:36.593
an ex-wife

31:36.595 --> 31:39.897
who drank herself into a coma

31:39.899 --> 31:43.033
every night for four

31:43.035 --> 31:47.404
years, and she pities me.

31:47.406 --> 31:50.440
I have a mother

31:50.442 --> 31:53.010
and a father
that I can't even look at

31:53.012 --> 31:54.311
without thinking
about throwing up.

31:54.313 --> 31:57.080
And I have a CD
where a daughter used to be.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.482
There's no family left, Greg!

32:00.552 --> 32:02.219
See, that's
what you realize.

32:04.123 --> 32:05.589
There's no
reason why.

32:05.591 --> 32:08.425
There's just people in pain,
spinning around a black hole,

32:08.427 --> 32:10.460
hoping that somebody,

32:12.431 --> 32:13.731
anybody...

32:13.732 --> 32:15.032
...will just
finish this!
Go now!

32:17.002 --> 32:18.302
(grunting)

32:18.304 --> 32:20.370
Go, go, go!

32:20.372 --> 32:21.305
WORDY:
Stay down!

32:21.307 --> 32:22.472
Stay down!
Don't move!

32:22.474 --> 32:23.507
No!
Don't move.

32:23.509 --> 32:25.042
Lay down
on the ground.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.477
No!<i> No!</i>

32:27.479 --> 32:29.379
No!

32:32.985 --> 32:34.584
Get him up.

32:38.557 --> 32:41.058
We know who's working
with you, Walter.

32:41.060 --> 32:42.726
Come on.

32:42.728 --> 32:44.661
It was Broder, right?

32:44.663 --> 32:47.297
Yeah.

32:48.267 --> 32:49.599
He put the call

32:49.601 --> 32:51.735
into-into the victim's group
for a distraction?

32:51.737 --> 32:54.004
The alternate route--
he tipped you off?

32:54.006 --> 32:56.006
What's this better idea
you're talking about?

32:56.008 --> 32:58.241
What's he supposed to do?

32:58.243 --> 33:00.310
(sighs)

33:00.312 --> 33:02.245
Come on, buddy.

33:02.247 --> 33:03.513
He's already in custody.

33:03.515 --> 33:05.582
Whatever it is,
it's not gonna happen.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.317
And the more
cooperative you are,

33:07.319 --> 33:09.152
the better it
will be for you.

33:09.154 --> 33:10.354
This isn't the Sudan, Walter.

33:10.356 --> 33:12.556
We can't change
the rules.

33:12.558 --> 33:14.691
We got a job to do,
no matter what.

33:14.693 --> 33:16.259
What about the Sudan?

33:16.261 --> 33:17.627
He was stationed there
last year.

33:17.629 --> 33:20.130
Why?
(touch tones beeping)

33:20.132 --> 33:22.499
Wordy, Donna,
get back to the prisoner

33:22.501 --> 33:23.734
right away.

33:23.736 --> 33:25.435
What's up, boss?

33:25.437 --> 33:26.603
Stupid.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.072
(sighs)

33:29.074 --> 33:30.474
Superintendent McLean's office?

33:30.476 --> 33:32.209
Yeah.

33:32.211 --> 33:34.044
Did Agent Semple
call today about a change

33:34.046 --> 33:35.679
in the escort route
for, uh, Peter Wilkins?

33:35.681 --> 33:37.514
(sighs)

33:37.516 --> 33:39.516
Thank you.

33:39.518 --> 33:40.751
(phone beeps off)

33:40.753 --> 33:42.686
Okay, Ed, uh,
they didn't get a call.

33:42.688 --> 33:44.087
They didn't get a call.

33:44.089 --> 33:45.322
She wasn't talking to them.

33:45.324 --> 33:46.790
So, what's that got
to do with Broder?

33:46.791 --> 33:48.257
Yeah, I think
Broder was telling the truth.

33:48.260 --> 33:49.626
He didn't have anything
to do with this.

33:49.628 --> 33:51.261
It was Walter
and Delia.

33:55.634 --> 33:57.634
Run.

33:57.636 --> 33:59.569
I need to make it look
like you tried to escape.

33:59.571 --> 34:01.671
I said run,
you son of a bitch.

34:02.474 --> 34:03.640
Run!

34:15.621 --> 34:17.187
(grunts)

34:17.189 --> 34:17.971
(panting)

34:17.972 --> 34:18.754
Clear.

34:18.757 --> 34:20.824
They're not here, boss.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.127
Listen to me, Walter.

34:24.128 --> 34:26.495
I know you think you're trying
to protect her, but you're not.

34:26.498 --> 34:29.833
If Agent Semple hurts that man,
she's done, she's destroyed.

34:29.835 --> 34:32.335
Have you not been listening,
Greg?

34:32.337 --> 34:36.073
She's already done.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.542
(panting)

34:38.544 --> 34:39.810
Run!

34:39.812 --> 34:41.645
WALTER:
<i> Logan got her sister</i>

34:41.647 --> 34:43.547
the same time he got my Julie.

34:43.549 --> 34:45.382
She could
have lost it,

34:45.384 --> 34:47.617
like most of us,
but she was... she was strong.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.519
She didn't even
tell her superiors.

34:49.521 --> 34:52.789
Her sister had a married name,
so she just kept it to herself.

34:52.791 --> 34:54.758
She tell you this in
Khartoum, the Sudan?

34:54.760 --> 34:56.393
Yeah.

34:56.395 --> 34:57.761
It was like
it happened for a reason.

34:57.763 --> 34:59.746
I mean, what are the chances?

34:59.747 --> 35:01.730
Both of us being there,
both of us trying to get away

35:01.733 --> 35:03.600
from the same thing,
but you c...

35:03.602 --> 35:06.403
You can't get away.
You can't get away.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.871
And it's like you can...

35:07.873 --> 35:10.440
It's like
you can smell it on each other.

35:10.442 --> 35:12.242
You know?

35:12.244 --> 35:14.244
Stinks like, uh...

35:14.246 --> 35:16.880
like gasoline.

35:16.882 --> 35:18.882
That kind of pain.

35:18.884 --> 35:21.585
What's she going
to do, Walter?

35:28.160 --> 35:29.860
All I had to do was shoot him.

35:29.862 --> 35:33.730
Now that's all she has to do.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.566
Boss, we're looking
at the CCTV now.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.668
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

35:38.670 --> 35:41.638
If she used her ID card,
there's a record of it.

35:41.640 --> 35:42.873
(computer chirps)

35:42.875 --> 35:44.241
Right here.

35:44.243 --> 35:45.509
I got her.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.777
Third basement,
right below us.

35:47.779 --> 35:49.246
The two of you get there.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.514
I'm on my way.

35:50.516 --> 35:52.549
Copy.
There's a door right
around the corner.

35:54.486 --> 35:56.853
(grunts)

35:58.924 --> 36:01.191
(groaning)

36:02.895 --> 36:04.928
No. No, please.

36:04.930 --> 36:08.198
Close your eyes,
and this will be over.

36:08.200 --> 36:09.299
Please.

36:09.301 --> 36:10.901
(loud, wheezing breathing)

36:10.903 --> 36:12.569
Close your eyes!

36:12.571 --> 36:13.803
Please.

36:13.805 --> 36:15.205
(whimpers,
footsteps approaching)

36:15.207 --> 36:17.240
(panting)
WORDY:
Agent Semple?

36:18.710 --> 36:21.878
I just want him
to close his eyes.

36:21.880 --> 36:23.246
You need to put
the gun down.

36:23.248 --> 36:25.382
I just need him
to close his eyes.

36:25.384 --> 36:26.583
I said, close

36:26.585 --> 36:28.618
your eyes!
Oh, please.

36:28.620 --> 36:29.853
No.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.556
(whispers):
Donna, on target.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.857
If you don't
put the gun down,

36:33.859 --> 36:35.358
we'll be forced
to shoot you.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.294
Do you understand?

36:37.296 --> 36:38.395
PARKER:
Delia?!

36:38.397 --> 36:40.564
Delia,

36:40.566 --> 36:41.731
what are you doing?

36:41.733 --> 36:43.233
This isn't right.

36:43.235 --> 36:44.668
This isn't justice.

36:44.670 --> 36:46.436
This is vengeance.
You know that.

36:46.438 --> 36:47.871
You don't know
what I know.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.406
PARKER:
Okay.

36:49.408 --> 36:52.209
But can I tell you
what I do know?

36:52.211 --> 36:54.778
You've had Wilkins all alone
for nearly 20 minutes.

36:54.780 --> 36:57.981
You could have killed him
by now, but you didn't.

36:57.983 --> 36:59.950
Because you're a cop.
You're not a killer.

37:02.821 --> 37:04.487
(sighs)

37:06.525 --> 37:08.558
I was a good cop.

37:08.560 --> 37:11.628
I was a good sister.

37:11.630 --> 37:13.230
And you still can be.

37:13.232 --> 37:15.498
No. He took that away.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.733
Now I'm just this.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.201
Delia, no!

37:18.202 --> 37:19.668
(echoing):
No! No...!
(gunshot)

37:21.306 --> 37:23.473
Get him down!

37:23.475 --> 37:25.242
(echoing):
Get him down!
Get him down!

37:55.474 --> 37:59.576
"After which point, Mr. Wilkins
was returned to our custody.

37:59.578 --> 38:01.945
"And the body of Agent Delia
Semple was transported

38:01.947 --> 38:05.348
to Metro General
awaiting an autopsy."

38:10.022 --> 38:12.722
Donna, do you have
anything to add?

38:15.594 --> 38:19.396
How did SIU go?

38:20.365 --> 38:23.033
I shot a cop.

38:23.035 --> 38:25.335
They're really happy.

38:29.341 --> 38:30.707
Donna, we have
a saying here.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.008
Just 'cause you did right,

38:32.010 --> 38:33.910
doesn't mean you
get to feel right.

38:37.883 --> 38:42.652
Our hands are clean, yeah?

38:52.698 --> 38:54.831
(Wordy sighs)

38:57.102 --> 38:59.069
(sighs)

38:59.071 --> 39:01.338
Okay.

39:28.667 --> 39:30.033
(siren blaring)

39:30.035 --> 39:32.102
