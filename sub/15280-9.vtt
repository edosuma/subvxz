F.B.I., Behavioral Analysis Unit
QUANTICO, VIRGINIA

00:13.880 --> 00:16.166
Hey.
-Hey. Yeah, thank you.

00:17.000 --> 00:19.036
-Where's Elle?
-Texas.

00:19.040 --> 00:20.109
Texas?

00:20.120 --> 00:22.668
Yes, she went to do a custodial
interview with William DeVries.

00:22.670 --> 00:24.570
-The child murderer?
-Yeah, he...

00:24.580 --> 00:26.707
He agreed to participate in
the ViCAP questionnaire.

00:27.250 --> 00:29.707
You're letting her do custodials
by herself already?

00:31.120 --> 00:32.246
She'll be fine.

01:05.380 --> 01:06.529
Hello?

01:06.540 --> 01:09.202
Dad, I kind of wrecked
another car.

01:09.210 --> 01:10.825
You did what?JOSH: I...

01:11.750 --> 01:13.786
-Were you drinking again?
-Well...

01:13.790 --> 01:16.076
You know what?
I'm done with you, Josh.

01:16.080 --> 01:17.411
Don't bother coming home.

01:46.880 --> 01:48.370
Let's get married.ELAINE: Married?

01:48.380 --> 01:49.415
Yeah, why not?

01:49.830 --> 01:52.321
I mean, we'll get married
and we'll have the kid.

01:53.040 --> 01:56.419
No.
I'm going to Dallas to take care of it.

02:30.580 --> 02:32.070
I don't understand.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.241
I won't be here
when you get back, Harold.

02:35.040 --> 02:37.952
I'm filing for divorce. I'm leaving you.

02:39.670 --> 02:41.490
I'm going to Dallas. Don't follow me.

02:59.040 --> 03:01.452
Linda, are you sure taking him
to Dallas is a good idea?

03:01.960 --> 03:03.666
I've written two books on this.

03:03.670 --> 03:07.663
And he's living proof of my theories.
We're going to that conference.

03:27.830 --> 03:29.286
It's me.

03:30.420 --> 03:31.705
DeVries cooperating?

03:31.710 --> 03:33.200
I won't even be there for an hour.

03:33.210 --> 03:35.610
I took a train from El Paso
instead of renting a car.

03:35.620 --> 03:37.747
I wanted to look over the files more.

03:37.750 --> 03:40.913
-Remember, he can't lie to you if...
-If I know the crime better than he does.

03:40.920 --> 03:43.161
-Yes, I remember, Dad.
-Good. Check in when you're done.

03:43.670 --> 03:45.410
-Wait.
-Elle, I'm swamped here.

03:45.420 --> 03:46.705
I'm in the middle of two consults.

03:46.710 --> 03:49.326
00.

03:49.330 --> 03:51.036
-What?
-I said I'm swamped.

03:51.040 --> 03:52.667
Wait, I'm losing you.

03:52.670 --> 03:55.241
Elle, I don't have time right now.
Can we talk when you get back?

03:55.250 --> 03:57.957
Yeah. Okay. Tomorrow.

03:57.960 --> 03:59.166
Elle, I'm...

03:59.920 --> 04:02.662
Hello

04:03.210 --> 04:04.199
Elle?

04:19.880 --> 04:21.575
Don't you see that?

04:26.460 --> 04:28.030
Leave me alone.

04:28.500 --> 04:29.660
Look.

04:32.960 --> 04:34.780
The file, Ted. Look at the file.

04:51.000 --> 04:55.448
I told you what was happening.
I told you where we were really going.

05:07.120 --> 05:09.076
What the hell was that?

05:09.790 --> 05:11.781
Everything's all right, folks.

05:11.790 --> 05:14.748
Everybody just relax.
Everything's going to be fine.

05:14.750 --> 05:16.570
What happened?

05:16.580 --> 05:21.074
-Nothing, ma'am. You on the job?
-FBI.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.201
Suicide. Somebody jumped
in front of the train.

05:24.790 --> 05:25.916
Is there anything...
-What the hell

05:25.920 --> 05:27.569
-are they whispering about?
-Unfortunately we have this procedure

05:27.580 --> 05:28.956
down fairly well.

05:30.120 --> 05:31.610
Everybody just relax.

05:31.620 --> 05:33.451
We're going to be back underway
again shortly.

05:33.460 --> 05:34.916
Don't worry, folks.

05:34.920 --> 05:36.285
Like I said,
everything's going to be okay.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.202
-Now or never, sport.
-Everything's going to be fine...

05:39.210 --> 05:40.950
Oh, my God!
LEO: Get the agent!

05:44.170 --> 05:46.821
Okay.

05:46.830 --> 05:50.573
Okay.
You don't have to hurt anybody else.

05:51.880 --> 05:55.202
-What are you doing?
-Shut up! Shut up!

05:56.920 --> 05:58.490
Good job, sport.

06:47.380 --> 06:50.702
Okay, this is from one of
the security cameras inside the train.

06:50.710 --> 06:53.247
Five hostages in a car
stopped on the tracks.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.411
We have one security guard dead
from initial gunfire.

06:55.420 --> 06:57.877
Is this going on right now?
JJ: Yeah, in West Texas.

06:57.880 --> 06:59.029
Why they asking for us?

06:59.040 --> 07:01.326
Because of a particular psychological
aspect of the hostage taker

07:01.330 --> 07:03.457
which we're especially
equipped to handle.

07:03.460 --> 07:05.872
Can you back the picture up
a few frames?

07:17.920 --> 07:19.535
Tardive dyskinesia.

07:19.540 --> 07:21.826
_ Once more for those of us
wrthout an encyclopedic memory?

07:21.830 --> 07:23.377
Severe facial tics.

07:23.380 --> 07:26.372
The kind that develop after years
of taking antipsychotic medication.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.826
-So this guy's a psychotic?
-A psychotic with hostages.

07:28.830 --> 07:31.742
-And two guns.
-Hostage situation on a train?

07:31.750 --> 07:34.412
-Yeah, in Texas.
-A train in Texas.

07:35.380 --> 07:36.665
My God!

07:36.920 --> 07:38.160
What?

07:38.170 --> 07:39.285
Elle.

07:39.290 --> 07:40.700
-Elle

07:45.960 --> 07:47.780
Robert Oxton Bolt wrote,

07:47.790 --> 07:50.418
"A belief is not merely an idea
the mind possesses,

07:50.420 --> 07:51.569
WEST TEXAS

07:51.580 --> 07:53.707
"it is an idea that possesses the mind."

07:54.290 --> 07:56.281
Local authorities
have the train surrounded.

07:56.290 --> 07:58.781
Bureau Hostage Rescue Team
snipers are in position,

07:58.790 --> 08:02.533
but they're hesitant to take action
until negotiation is exhausted.

08:02.540 --> 08:05.828
The feed from_ the train's two video
cameras are being routed to monitors

08:05.830 --> 08:09.209
on a mobile command center that
the local Bureau office brought In.

08:10.330 --> 08:12.036
We need to _know who on that train's
gorng to be a help

08:12.040 --> 08:13.416
and who's going to be a problem.

08:13.420 --> 08:16.207
All right, let me get Garcia to work
some magic on those video feeds.

08:18.250 --> 08:20.878
-Cmo se dice "hottie"

08:20.880 --> 08:21.995
Precisely.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.410
Okay, listen to me. No playing.

08:23.420 --> 08:25.376
We're going to be feeding you
some security camera video

08:25.380 --> 08:27.780
from a hostage situation
over a secure line.

08:28.500 --> 08:31.378
Can you work your face recognition
sobeare over it and tell me who's who?

08:31.380 --> 08:33.746
If they have their picture on file
anywhere, I will find them.

08:33.750 --> 08:36.241
Penelope, Elle is one of the hostages.

08:37.290 --> 08:38.416
I'm into it.

08:41.080 --> 08:42.911
She'll get us the names.

08:42.920 --> 08:44.990
Have we had any contact inside
the train yet?

08:45.000 --> 08:48.413
Well, it took two hours just to
convince him to allow a two-way phone.

08:48.420 --> 08:53.995
But he won't speak to anyone except
what he calls the "Higher Authorities."

08:54.670 --> 08:56.991
-God?
-No mention of religion thus far.

08:57.000 --> 09:00.072
Has Crisis Negotiation lead
claimed to be the Higher Authority?

09:00.080 --> 09:02.287
The UnSub won't speak to him
anylongen

09:02.290 --> 09:05.498
He gave a deadline of three hours
to produce this Authority.

09:06.040 --> 09:07.701
Three... When was that?

09:09.120 --> 09:10.451
Two-and-a-half hours ago.

09:10.460 --> 09:12.166
Well, he wants to speak to
the Higher Authority.

09:12.170 --> 09:13.489
Then we better give it to him.

09:13.500 --> 09:15.240
Put the lights on, sirens,
honk the horns.

09:15.250 --> 09:16.990
Make people get out of our way.

09:17.750 --> 09:19.456
Get as close to the barricade
as possrble.

09:19.460 --> 09:21.200
When we stop, we sit.
We wait 30 seconds.

09:21.210 --> 09:22.609
Then we step out.

09:48.330 --> 09:51.072
Here they come. Showtime, Teddy.

09:56.830 --> 09:58.536
Teddy, you have to listen to me.

09:59.040 --> 10:00.075
No!

10:01.420 --> 10:03.786
You have to listen to me now.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.918
Lady, your boyfriend
is whacked out of his mind.

10:07.920 --> 10:10.411
Then who is he?

10:10.880 --> 10:12.700
He's a psych patient, right?

10:13.500 --> 10:15.206
Yes. It's going to be okay.

10:15.210 --> 10:16.746
And you know that how?

10:18.380 --> 10:19.779
You're his doctor?

10:20.290 --> 10:23.498
I was taking him to Dallas
to speak at a conference

10:23.500 --> 10:25.286
as an example of
the progress being made

10:25.290 --> 10:27.110
to relieve severe psychosis.

10:27.880 --> 10:30.610
-He's an example of progress

10:30.620 --> 10:33.453
He's never had this sort of break
from reality.

10:33.460 --> 10:35.781
-Never been violent.
-What can we do?

10:36.330 --> 10:38.457
Make him feel less threatened.

10:38.460 --> 10:41.281
We're a threat to him?
He's got two guns.

10:44.960 --> 10:48.919
-You all right?
-No. I think I'm going to be sick.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.109
Oh, great.

10:52.210 --> 10:54.610
You all right?
-Yeah.

10:56.460 --> 10:59.281
I just haven't been feeling
that well lately.

10:59.290 --> 11:00.666
My stomach.

11:01.380 --> 11:03.029
You're not pregnant?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.161
Teddy?

11:14.880 --> 11:18.498
It's a trick, Ted.

11:18.500 --> 11:20.320
Shut up!

11:20.330 --> 11:21.740
Sit down!

11:28.460 --> 11:30.200
What are you doing?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.325
Don't be stupid.

11:40.080 --> 11:42.378
Are you kidding me?
-Shh.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.611
What are you going to do

11:49.330 --> 11:51.207
Why are they just sitting there?

11:52.500 --> 11:53.956
Come on!

11:54.920 --> 11:57.320
Whacked out of his mind.

12:10.120 --> 12:12.452
Don't look at the train.
Ignore It.

12:12.460 --> 12:15.167
Higher Authority isn't concerned about
losing a few civilians.

12:15.170 --> 12:16.910
I'll talk to the HRT commander.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.491
-I'm Frank MorettiHDallas Field Office.
- I.

12:19.500 --> 12:22.537
As near as we can tell,
your agent is still all right.

12:23.040 --> 12:25.452
Has the subject asked for anything

12:25.750 --> 12:28.457
Not beyond wanting to talk
to a Higher Authority.

12:29.580 --> 12:32.572
How do we negotiate with a psychotic
who won't talk to us?

12:32.580 --> 12:35.162
That depends on the level
of his particular delusion.

12:35.170 --> 12:37.821
Some psychotics believe they're being
sent messages by the government,

12:37.830 --> 12:39.661
God, even aliens.

12:39.670 --> 12:43.162
John Nash, he believed he was being
recruited by aliens to save the world.

12:43.540 --> 12:44.825
I saw the movie.

12:45.120 --> 12:47.168
Actually, the movie is rather inaccurate
in its portrayal of...

12:47.170 --> 12:49.456
Okay, Doc, Doc. A movie review's
not going to help us right now.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.951
-Let's move.
-You're right. Sorry.

12:53.080 --> 12:54.160
After you.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.075
What's the status?

13:08.080 --> 13:10.162
We're in position from every angle.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.911
All right, we might be able to negotiate
with this guy,

13:12.920 --> 13:15.115
but if he requests a priest,

13:15.120 --> 13:17.281
or if his behavior in any way
reflects an endgame

13:17.290 --> 13:18.996
of killing himself and the hostages,
then it's over,

13:19.000 --> 13:20.706
and we need to take the shot
and rush the train.

13:22.710 --> 13:23.699
Come on.

13:24.500 --> 13:26.741
Come on. Come on. Come on.

13:26.750 --> 13:29.162
This is going to end today.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.609
Stay focused here, Ted.

13:40.790 --> 13:44.374
His delusions are important,
because that's what we have to play to.

13:46.000 --> 13:49.822
-So the question of the day...
-What's he believe is happening here?

13:49.830 --> 13:50.910
Good luck.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.956
I tried to convince him
I was the Highest Authority,

13:52.960 --> 13:54.245
but he wouldn't believe me.

13:54.250 --> 13:56.992
Well, he's paranoid.
He believes in secrets.

13:57.000 --> 14:00.072
If I'm the Higher Authority,
I don't go to him. He comes to me.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.708
We have to help him
ask the first question.

14:04.670 --> 14:05.819
Hey, guys...

14:07.710 --> 14:09.996
-Ted, you have to try and concentrate...
-Get up!

14:10.420 --> 14:11.956
Take me.
-No!

14:11.960 --> 14:13.416
Take me! Take me!

14:20.710 --> 14:23.031
You think I'm going to let you
send them messages?

14:23.040 --> 14:24.780
They're going to want to talk to me.

14:24.790 --> 14:27.327
I can get you whatever it is
that you want. Take me!

14:27.330 --> 14:29.537
Don't buy it, Ted.

14:30.330 --> 14:31.536
Hey, man...

14:33.080 --> 14:35.913
-You, too?
-No, no. I didn't do anything!

14:36.250 --> 14:38.662
Ted, you're not in any danger here.
You have to believe me.

14:38.670 --> 14:39.659
Please.

14:42.380 --> 14:43.824
Easy does it.

14:44.960 --> 14:46.996
Don't say a single word unless I say it.

14:47.000 --> 14:49.787
Deviate a single word and I will kill you.

14:49.790 --> 14:52.918
Don't try to send them any
secret messages or codes.

14:53.670 --> 14:55.877
-Do you understand

14:55.880 --> 14:58.872
-Do you understand?
-Yes! Yes! All right. All right.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.115
Oh, God.

15:11.540 --> 15:12.529
Yes.

15:12.790 --> 15:14.826
Ask him who they were,
the ones who just arrived.

15:16.080 --> 15:20.870
He wants to know who you are.
He wants to know who just arrived.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.610
Tell him it's someone _
who can help resolve the Situation.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.327
He says it's someone
who can resolve the situation.

15:26.330 --> 15:28.321
What part of
the government do they work for?

15:29.080 --> 15:32.618
What... What part of the government
do you work for?

15:32.620 --> 15:34.827
I never said I was with the government.

15:34.830 --> 15:36.741
Wait.

15:36.750 --> 15:38.786
The less he says,
the more mysterious we seem,

15:38.790 --> 15:41.031
the higher an authority we become.

15:44.540 --> 15:46.667
What part of the...
What part of the government?

15:46.670 --> 15:48.376
All right. Don't hurt her.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.286
Ask who they work for.

16:05.580 --> 16:07.411
They're FBI, aren't they?

16:07.420 --> 16:09.069
Are you FBI?

16:10.580 --> 16:12.491
He can ask me himself.

16:15.040 --> 16:17.702
He said you can ask him yourself.

16:23.960 --> 16:26.611
Tell me who you are or this agent dies!

16:29.670 --> 16:31.570
You know who I am.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.914
If you're the Higher Authority,
then you can have it removed.

16:38.250 --> 16:39.786
It'll take some time.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.701
I want it removed now.

16:44.210 --> 16:48.374
You know... You know,
it can't be done that quickly.

16:53.040 --> 16:54.996
-Goodbye.
-No! Wait!

16:55.000 --> 16:55.989
Okay!

16:58.380 --> 16:59.369
One hour.

17:00.420 --> 17:03.378
You have one hour to remove it.

17:04.080 --> 17:07.072
Or I swear to God
I'll kill every agent on this train.

17:14.210 --> 17:15.325
"It"?

17:15.330 --> 17:18.413
He wants "it" removed

17:18.790 --> 17:19.779
No.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.617
We just bought an hour, though,
to figure it out.

17:34.120 --> 17:35.667
We have 40 minutes left.

17:35.670 --> 17:37.615
Reid, is there a delusion
more common than others

17:37.620 --> 17:39.326
to a paranoid mind
in a psychotic episode?

17:39.330 --> 17:41.412
Delusions are as varied as
the people that have them.

17:41.420 --> 17:42.819
They're colored by
personal experience.

17:46.830 --> 17:48.878
You can't turn back now, Ted.

17:48.880 --> 17:52.498
They won't ever stop hounding you
and following you.

17:52.500 --> 17:54.991
I'm doing it. Leave me alone!

17:59.540 --> 18:01.496
Any of you guys have a cell phone
with service?

18:01.500 --> 18:04.162
We're in the middle of nowhere.
Welcome to Texas.

18:04.170 --> 18:05.455
Ow.

18:05.460 --> 18:07.997
You're bleeding more than
you should be from a cut this small.

18:08.620 --> 18:09.871
Thin blood.

18:09.880 --> 18:14.613
The agents outside need to know
what "it" is that he wants removed.

18:14.620 --> 18:16.417
He thinks the government
is watching him.

18:16.420 --> 18:19.207
They monitor all of us.

18:19.210 --> 18:22.077
They have ways of finding out
everything you do.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.616
Don't be stupid.

18:23.620 --> 18:26.168
There's an FBI agent onboard.
You think that's a coincidence?

18:26.830 --> 18:27.990
I'm doing it!

18:28.500 --> 18:29.956
He's going to kill us,
isn't he?

18:29.960 --> 18:31.166
No.

18:31.170 --> 18:32.489
He killed that security guard.

18:32.500 --> 18:35.037
The security guard had a gun.
He felt threatened by him.

18:36.750 --> 18:37.910
It's so hot!

18:39.540 --> 18:41.667
You took hostages
in the middle of Texas.

18:41.670 --> 18:43.490
Of course it's hot.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.416
No!

18:49.500 --> 18:51.036
That's exactly what they want, Ted.

18:51.040 --> 18:54.077
They want to divert you
from having it removed.

18:59.460 --> 19:01.951
You're close to having it removed.

19:05.000 --> 19:07.207
-His arm.
-What?

19:09.080 --> 19:10.786
Look at his arm.

19:11.880 --> 19:13.199
What is that?

19:13.920 --> 19:15.160
They look like scars.

19:15.170 --> 19:18.071
The places he tried to dig it out
with a razor or a pen.

19:18.080 --> 19:20.071
-Dig what out?
-Maybe a microchip.

19:20.080 --> 19:21.661
Oh, man.
It's almost as common a delusion

19:21.670 --> 19:23.319
as claiming to be the new Messiah.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.950
Ralph Tortorici held
an entire classroom hostage

19:25.960 --> 19:28.110
because he believed microchips
had been implanted in his body.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.457
Wait a minute. This guy thinks he has
some kind of device stuck in his arm?

19:31.460 --> 19:34.031
Probably.
And if we don't take it out,

19:35.580 --> 19:37.787
he's going to kill somebody.

19:43.210 --> 19:45.701
-Yeah. It's Morgan.
-I got your names.

19:45.710 --> 19:47.371
Okay, Garcia. Talk to me.

19:48.290 --> 19:50.531
Skinny guy in a suit is Harry Anderson.

19:50.540 --> 19:54.499
The young guy is a former
Gillett University undergrad.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.958
The girl is Elaine Curtis, from, get this,

19:58.210 --> 20:00.417
Adobe Walls in Terlingua, Texas.

20:00.670 --> 20:03.070
The lady in the nice suit
is Linda Deaton.

20:03.080 --> 20:06.459
-author and renowned psychiatrist.
-Penelope, you are truly amazing.

20:07.330 --> 20:10.709
Yeah. Not so fast.
I got your bonus answer, too.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.285
Your hostage taker?

20:12.290 --> 20:16.704
He's famous, academically speaking.
His name is Bryar. Dr. Theodore Bryar.

20:16.710 --> 20:18.871
Okay, you know what?
Send it all to me right now.

20:18.880 --> 20:20.029
Keep digging.

20:20.040 --> 20:23.328
-Penelope, nice work.
-Tell me about the hostages.

20:25.250 --> 20:28.458
Okay, see,
first we've got Harry Anderson.

20:28.460 --> 20:29.950
He's a paper goods salesman.

20:29.960 --> 20:33.077
Lived in a small home just outside
of Dallas for 18 years with his wife.

20:33.080 --> 20:34.320
He's got no children.

20:34.330 --> 20:36.742
No investments,
no company retirement portfolio.

20:36.750 --> 20:40.572
He doesn't take chances.
Tell me about the kid.

20:41.750 --> 20:44.116
Kid's name, Josh Patel.
He's 20 years old.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.997
He just got expelled
from Gillett University

20:46.000 --> 20:47.877
for driving his car
into the library building drunk.

20:47.880 --> 20:48.949
He's drinking now.

20:48.960 --> 20:51.167
Okay, the girl.

20:51.170 --> 20:52.660
We don't have a lot to go on.

20:52.670 --> 20:55.241
Nothing more than her driver's license.
Her name's Elaine Curtis.

20:55.710 --> 20:57.575
She lives in a small town
In West Texas.

20:57.580 --> 21:00.162
She's got no credit cards, no passport.

21:00.170 --> 21:01.990
Doesn't look like
she travels much at all.

21:02.580 --> 21:05.572
This is Dr. Linda Deaton.

21:05.580 --> 21:07.821
She's a psychiatrist at Stokes
Mental Health Center in El Paso.

21:07.830 --> 21:09.821
That's where Ted Bryar's been living
for the last nine years.

21:09.830 --> 21:12.287
-His doctor?
-I say probably.

21:12.290 --> 21:15.703
She's unmarried, lives in El Paso,
she's written several books and papers,

21:15.710 --> 21:18.952
mainly published in medical circles.
She's a popular lecturer.

21:19.830 --> 21:22.037
She's scheduled to speak
several symposiums this year,

21:22.040 --> 21:26.579
and tonight in Dallas.
That's it. That's all I got.

21:27.420 --> 21:29.206
Garcia is in the process
of looking deeper,

21:29.210 --> 21:31.280
but I don't really see how this lineup

21:31.290 --> 21:33.030
is going to be
much of a help to us, Gideon.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.786
Well, let's just hope none of them
makes the situation worse.

21:42.420 --> 21:44.911
They're messing with you
out there, Ted.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.912
Trying to weaken you.
You need resolve.

21:49.500 --> 21:50.819
Hmm.

21:52.290 --> 21:53.279
Hey.

21:54.710 --> 21:56.780
Why aren't they helping us?

21:56.790 --> 21:58.951
We're going to get
through this just fine.

21:58.960 --> 22:00.075
We?

22:00.330 --> 22:02.992
He isn't pissed at us.
You're the government agent.

22:03.000 --> 22:06.663
He probably thinks we're all agents.
He believes almost everyone is.

22:07.670 --> 22:11.037
-I'm not with any government agent.
-He's trying to confuse you.

22:11.040 --> 22:13.918
I'm with you. Big Brother, right?

22:13.920 --> 22:18.072
Newthink, newspeak?
Hate is love, war is peace.

22:18.080 --> 22:19.957
He's laughing at you.

22:20.380 --> 22:22.109
-Stop it!
-No, Ted. It's okay.

22:22.120 --> 22:25.533
-He doesn't mean anything.
-Yeah, chill. I support you.

22:25.540 --> 22:27.576
Screw the government.

22:34.420 --> 22:36.160
Make him sit down.

22:51.290 --> 22:53.667
All right, how do we remove
a microchip that's not there?

22:53.670 --> 22:56.377
His speech is lucid.
There's no sign of neologisms,

22:56.380 --> 22:58.245
word salad _ _
or loosening of assocnations.

22:58.250 --> 22:59.820
As long as he can systematize,

22:59.830 --> 23:01.786
he'll be able to keep
his thinking relatively organized.

23:02.290 --> 23:04.667
Organized enough to see through
any game we try to throw at him?

23:04.670 --> 23:06.069
And if he's convinced it's in his arm,

23:06.080 --> 23:07.991
and not in a place like his lower back
or his neck...

23:08.000 --> 23:09.877
An _incision means_
he's gomg to be watching.

23:10.120 --> 23:13.374
Maybe we can just convince him that
he's been looking in the wrong place.

23:13.380 --> 23:14.870
Or we could fake it.

23:17.460 --> 23:20.827
Conceal a chip in the palm.
A little sleight of hand.

23:21.960 --> 23:23.575
Come on, Reid, what are you
talking about

23:23.580 --> 23:25.616
-Yeah, I'm talking about a magic trick.
-No.

23:25.620 --> 23:27.497
I used to do it during college exams.

23:27.500 --> 23:29.161
I can make it appear,
I can make it disappear.

23:29.170 --> 23:31.286
We can't risk giving him
another agent as a hostage.

23:31.290 --> 23:32.951
We have to do something.

23:34.790 --> 23:38.453
-All right, Reid, let's go teach it to me.
-What? No.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.075
Look, if you can do it, I can do it.
Show it to me.

23:41.080 --> 23:42.286
I've been practicing this my whole life.

23:42.290 --> 23:43.416
We have less than 30 minutes.

23:43.420 --> 23:45.206
Reid, I am not about to let you
get on that train

23:45.210 --> 23:46.325
with an armed psychotic.

23:46.330 --> 23:48.286
We don't have any other choice, do we?

23:48.290 --> 23:49.279
No.

23:51.830 --> 23:54.116
We don't have any other choice.

24:01.500 --> 24:04.071
Dr. Bryar is definitely one of
the top physicists in the world.

24:04.080 --> 24:06.878
He's written hundreds of papers
on M-Theory.

24:07.420 --> 24:08.876
I don't understand any of it.

24:08.880 --> 24:11.952
Oh, he worked for the government
for several years in the '805.

24:11.960 --> 24:13.951
Probably the source of his delusions.

24:14.620 --> 24:17.168
He's been institutionalized
for the past nine years.

24:17.670 --> 24:20.116
Until Dr. Deaton took him on a field trip.

24:20.120 --> 24:21.109
Yeah.

24:21.960 --> 24:23.951
What we need is a strategy.

24:23.960 --> 24:26.952
-I'll try to talk to him.
-You think that's wise?

24:32.620 --> 24:33.609
Ted?

24:36.040 --> 24:38.452
You feel a little bit better now?

24:41.040 --> 24:42.701
You're in no danger here.

24:44.040 --> 24:48.488
-These people don't want to hurt you.
- Sure they don't.

24:49.580 --> 24:52.993
The FBI agent just happened to be
on the train today.

24:53.000 --> 24:56.572
She wasn't following you.
Wasn't watching you.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.912
She expects you to believe that?

25:00.420 --> 25:03.412
Let them go, Ted. I'll stay with you.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.536
You and I will do this together,

25:08.120 --> 25:10.782
only you need to let these people go.

25:12.040 --> 25:17.285
I will wait with you.
No one wants to hurt you.

25:23.290 --> 25:24.826
-No!
-No, it's okay, Ted.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.707
Ted, it's okay.
-Don't!

25:28.000 --> 25:30.958
I will make sure
that they never take It out of you.

25:30.960 --> 25:34.168
If you hurt one more person
on this train, I swear to God,

25:34.170 --> 25:36.320
I'll make them leave it in you forever.

25:46.540 --> 25:47.780
What?

25:47.790 --> 25:50.111
Everything all right in there, Dr. Bryar?

25:50.380 --> 25:51.574
I want it out.

25:52.540 --> 25:54.531
Well, I'm sending two technicians in
to remove it.

25:54.540 --> 25:55.780
No! One.

25:57.210 --> 25:58.450
One technician.

25:58.460 --> 26:00.030
Well, it's a delicate procedure.
It requires...

26:00.040 --> 26:01.701
One technician.

26:01.960 --> 26:05.077
-Or every agent on this train dies.
-Okay.

26:06.330 --> 26:07.615
You need to relax.

26:07.620 --> 26:10.168
-We still have 20 minutes.
-Not any more.

26:11.460 --> 26:15.874
I want it out now. Right now! Now!

26:26.420 --> 26:29.492
-I don't know about this.
-It'll look better when it's covered.

26:29.500 --> 26:31.240
-With what?
-Blood.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.616
Reid, do not
take this vest off.

26:45.210 --> 26:46.450
In hostage situations,

26:46.460 --> 26:48.030
SWAT sometimes won't even tell
the negotiator

26:48.040 --> 26:49.826
when they're deciding to go in.
Do you know why that is?

26:49.830 --> 26:51.991
Because the slightest change
in tone of voice or choice of words

26:52.000 --> 26:54.070
-can give the whole thing away.
-That's right.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.116
Don't make eye contact with Elle.

26:56.120 --> 26:57.747
You're a technician.
You've never seen her before.

26:57.750 --> 26:59.115
-Got it.
-And remember,

26:59.120 --> 27:01.076
play into the guy's fantasy.
Believe it yourself.

27:01.080 --> 27:02.240
Actually, did you know that dentists

27:02.250 --> 27:03.376
and surgeons have been recruited

27:03.380 --> 27:05.746
to secretly implant these during
otherwise normal medical procedures?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.662
This has been happening on and off
since the late 19305.

27:10.080 --> 27:12.378
-Told me to believe.
- Let's go.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.826
All right.
One government-issued microchip.

27:21.670 --> 27:22.739
You got to relax, man.

27:22.750 --> 27:26.163
The chip's a lot smaller than
I'm used to doing it with, all right?

27:27.170 --> 27:29.661
No, no. Hold on.

27:29.670 --> 27:31.376
One more.

27:40.170 --> 27:43.162
Take his chip out,
then get off the train, you understand?

27:43.170 --> 27:45.035
Tell him you need to get back to
the Higher Authority,

27:45.040 --> 27:47.873
say you have guidelines
to follow, whatever.

27:48.120 --> 27:52.113
Do not stay in there with him.
That's an order.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.109
Yes, sir.

27:55.830 --> 27:58.207
-Can you guys do me a favor?
-Anything.

27:58.210 --> 28:01.702
Could at least one of you look like
you're going to see me again?

28:03.540 --> 28:05.371
See you when you get back.

28:33.250 --> 28:35.070
No! No!
BRYAR: Get up!

28:46.620 --> 28:48.417
Tell your men
to get whatever target they can.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.456
If this starts to go bad,
we're going to go in.

28:50.460 --> 28:52.496
Probably not going
to have a great shot.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.206
Take the one they can get.

29:14.080 --> 29:16.571
That's far enough, Ted.
BRYAR: That's far enough.

29:17.580 --> 29:18.990
Hello, everyone.

29:21.290 --> 29:24.202
Here to remove
a chip from Dr. Bryar.

29:24.460 --> 29:25.666
Check him out.

29:27.120 --> 29:29.327
Take the vest off. I want to see you.

29:30.960 --> 29:32.996
I don't have any weapons.

29:33.330 --> 29:36.822
The Higher Authority
doesn't authorize it for technicians.

29:36.830 --> 29:37.990
Take it off!

29:45.000 --> 29:47.878
Damn it, Reid.
I said, "Don't take the vest off."

29:50.920 --> 29:52.205
Come closer.

29:53.330 --> 29:56.572
I want to see both of your hands
at all times.

30:07.250 --> 30:09.206
You sit across from me.

30:30.580 --> 30:32.207
Why are you so nervous?

30:32.750 --> 30:34.911
I told you.
I'm not used to being around guns.

30:53.620 --> 30:56.373
This is going to
probably sting a little bit.

31:29.380 --> 31:30.995
Whoa. Did you see that?

31:32.670 --> 31:36.208
I knew it. I knew it.

31:38.500 --> 31:41.492
Hey, look. He's got it. He's got it.
He's got the chip.

31:41.500 --> 31:43.377
I've gotta go to the Higher Authority.
I was supposed...

31:43.380 --> 31:45.166
Not yet!

31:51.290 --> 31:52.746
Turn it on.

32:06.620 --> 32:07.996
Turn the chip on.

32:17.040 --> 32:18.496
Excuse me?

32:18.500 --> 32:21.162
-Get off the train, Reid.
-No, no, something's wrong.

32:23.210 --> 32:25.030
Get off the train.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.996
-Get out of there.
-Why isn't he moving?

32:28.000 --> 32:29.956
How many shots
would it take to move in?

32:29.960 --> 32:32.997
Two. First blows the window.
Second takes Bryar down.

32:33.000 --> 32:35.036
Yeah, and he'll be shooting after
the windows go.

32:35.040 --> 32:37.702
-It's the best we can do.
-All right. Stand by.

32:41.330 --> 32:43.742
Turn it on, or I pull the trigger.

32:49.330 --> 32:52.413
-I can't turn it on.
-Why not

32:52.420 --> 32:54.911
-Because it has to be implanted.
-She's right.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.740
The chip derives its power from
tiny electrical impulses

32:56.750 --> 32:57.910
fired between neurons.

32:57.920 --> 33:00.036
It has to be in your skin to work.

33:03.540 --> 33:05.531
-I really gotta...
-Sit down!

33:05.540 --> 33:07.610
You're not going anywhere.

33:14.540 --> 33:16.952
See? Dude actually had a chip in his arm.

33:18.250 --> 33:20.320
All right, it seems calm for now.

33:21.000 --> 33:22.706
Reid's still on the train.

33:23.330 --> 33:25.616
Now we have two agents in there.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.747
It's probably the Higher Authority.

33:41.080 --> 33:42.411
I told you. I have protocols to follow.

33:42.420 --> 33:44.490
I was supposed to go
right back out there.

33:44.500 --> 33:45.956
I have rules.

33:47.790 --> 33:49.166
Answer the phone.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.326
You want me to stay,
I'm obviously going to stay.

33:54.330 --> 33:57.709
But, I mean, you're going to be the one
that has to explain it to the Man.

33:57.710 --> 33:59.530
Whoa, "the Man"?

34:00.000 --> 34:03.458
They're still trying to tell you
what to do, Ted.

34:04.170 --> 34:06.456
Why can't you all just leave me alone?

34:06.460 --> 34:07.609
Leave you alone?

34:07.620 --> 34:10.532
Stay out of this.
-No. The government does watch us.

34:13.580 --> 34:16.913
You got microwaves and satellites.
I'm with you, man.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.740
-Do not agitate him.
-Screw you.

34:18.750 --> 34:19.990
Dr. Bryar, answer the phone.

34:20.000 --> 34:22.491
My old man used to have
tracking devices in his cars.

34:22.500 --> 34:25.992
He said it's for theft,
but it's so he can find out where I go.

34:26.000 --> 34:28.070
And what about personal recordings
in televisions?

34:28.080 --> 34:30.742
You don't think someone's monitoring
everything you watch?

34:31.120 --> 34:36.285
You know how many patents are issued
for devices to monitor people?

34:36.830 --> 34:38.206
Look it up, man.

34:38.210 --> 34:40.997
Here he comes, Ted.
He's the agent who's playing the hero.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.615
Answer the phone, Ted.

34:42.620 --> 34:44.918
-Stop this. It isn't going to help.
-What the hell do you know?

34:45.500 --> 34:47.570
Ted, he doesn't know
what he's talking about.

34:47.580 --> 34:49.821
-He's just a kid.
-Who you calling a kid?

34:51.380 --> 34:52.916
Sit down!

34:52.920 --> 34:54.410
Oh, now you're going to tell me
what to do?

34:54.420 --> 34:56.240
He'd only have one gun
if you weren't here.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.706
He's not with us, Ted.

34:57.710 --> 34:59.029
He's not with us at all.

34:59.040 --> 35:01.873
Answer the phone, Dr. Bryar.
It's the Higher Authority.

35:02.170 --> 35:04.206
They're coming for you, Ted.

35:04.210 --> 35:05.199
No!

35:08.460 --> 35:10.200
Teddy...
JOSH: Oh, damn.

35:11.120 --> 35:12.576
Damn.

35:13.040 --> 35:14.109
Oh.

35:28.960 --> 35:30.916
-What

35:30.920 --> 35:33.741
-I did what you asked for.
-I'm tired.

35:35.290 --> 35:39.579
-I've been fighting you for so long.
-You don't have to fight any more.

35:39.580 --> 35:41.571
He's a liar, Ted.

35:43.960 --> 35:46.110
I said it all ends today.

35:49.210 --> 35:51.496
Me, these agents.

35:53.120 --> 35:54.826
It all ends today.

36:01.500 --> 36:04.071
-What does that mean?
-It means he's decided on an endgame.

36:04.330 --> 36:06.378
He's going to kill himself

36:06.380 --> 36:08.166
and the hostages.

36:20.460 --> 36:25.580
Ted, no one on this train
is an agent but me.

36:27.880 --> 36:29.279
No one else.

36:31.460 --> 36:34.668
I'm the only one.
You can let everybody else go.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.872
I don't think so, Ted. Do you?

36:39.500 --> 36:41.491
Dr. Bryar,
we need to get this woman help.

36:42.830 --> 36:44.411
Who's going to help me?

36:46.540 --> 36:49.668
The Higher Authorities can help you.
They're not what you think.

36:49.670 --> 36:52.707
They're not the enemy.
They can help you, Dr. Bryar.

37:05.500 --> 37:06.956
Not any more.

37:18.540 --> 37:21.031
Got it.

37:21.420 --> 37:23.786
Gideon, you send those guys in there,
hostages are going to die.

37:23.790 --> 37:25.610
Yeah.

37:25.620 --> 37:28.532
You don't do something,
they're going to die aanay.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.069
It's not gone.

37:37.790 --> 37:38.779
I know.

37:39.080 --> 37:43.779
Well, you said when the chip came out,
it would go away.

37:45.790 --> 37:47.997
It's... I still hear it.

37:48.000 --> 37:49.991
Then there must be more of them.

37:50.250 --> 37:52.741
You said it was the only one, Leo.

37:53.500 --> 37:56.958
I can still feel the buzzing.

37:56.960 --> 37:58.871
The burning.

37:58.880 --> 38:00.609
-Dr. Bryar

38:00.620 --> 38:03.032
-Reid.
-It's all right, Elle.

38:04.620 --> 38:06.531
Is there another one?

38:10.920 --> 38:12.410
You know there isn't.

38:13.880 --> 38:17.077
Don't listen, Ted.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.825
Make it stop!

38:25.540 --> 38:27.110
I know what it's like.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.372
-Make it stop!
-I know what the voices are like.

38:30.620 --> 38:32.201
He's trying to trick you.

38:32.210 --> 38:33.325
The voices. They won't stop.

38:33.330 --> 38:34.706
They've been talking to you
since you were a child.

38:34.710 --> 38:37.577
He's telling you I'm not real.
He is lying to you.

38:37.580 --> 38:38.740
You're lying to me.

38:38.750 --> 38:41.457
That's Leo speaking.
That's not even Dr. Bryar.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.996
Why don't you let him
think for himself, Leo?

38:49.880 --> 38:53.202
You... Can you see him?

38:53.210 --> 38:55.747
Shoot this kid.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.661
Why don't you let him
make his own decisions?

38:57.670 --> 38:59.069
Shoot him!

38:59.080 --> 39:02.072
The voices. They helped you, right?

39:02.880 --> 39:05.166
It's where you get your ideas from.

39:05.170 --> 39:06.819
While the other kids were outside
in the playground,

39:06.830 --> 39:09.162
you were inside reading,
studying, learning.

39:09.170 --> 39:10.660
The voices wouldn't stop.

39:10.670 --> 39:14.743
They helped you understand things
that other people could never realize

39:14.750 --> 39:16.206
and...

39:16.500 --> 39:20.618
Then as you grew older,
it became almost a responsibility.

39:20.620 --> 39:23.077
Right?
A responsibility to use that ability.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.742
To use your knowledge.

39:27.120 --> 39:30.112
String theory. The Theory of Everything.

39:30.120 --> 39:31.280
Shoot him, Ted.

39:31.290 --> 39:34.453
Then M-Theory, encompassing
all the strings, unifying the theories.

39:34.460 --> 39:36.667
You know what's funny?

39:37.040 --> 39:40.032
Most people say that M-Theory

39:40.040 --> 39:44.329
can never be proved because
the mathematical tools do not yet exist.

39:44.330 --> 39:48.494
But you see it, right

39:49.380 --> 39:53.453
You can see the different strings
unifying the dimensions.

39:53.460 --> 39:56.372
The gravitational infinities
canceling each other out.

39:56.380 --> 39:59.031
You see them. Right, Dr. Bryar?

39:59.040 --> 40:01.531
You see them
because you have the tools.

40:02.250 --> 40:04.878
Your mind is that tool.

40:04.880 --> 40:06.495
He's one of them, Ted.
One of them.

40:06.750 --> 40:07.990
Shut up!

40:08.000 --> 40:10.207
It's going on too long.
I'm going in.

40:12.920 --> 40:17.323
And I have to believe that
if you put your mind to it,

40:17.620 --> 40:20.828
you'll realize that
only you can make Leo stop.

40:21.380 --> 40:23.610
You can make him stop
by understanding him.

40:23.620 --> 40:28.114
By understanding that he is a liar
and he only wants bad things for you.

40:28.120 --> 40:31.499
I said kill him, Ted!

40:58.080 --> 41:00.822
I had to. He was going to kill us.

41:01.330 --> 41:03.457
I had to. God forgive me.

41:05.500 --> 41:07.320
We need an ambulance.

41:11.790 --> 41:13.417
I'm sorry.

41:13.420 --> 41:15.570
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

41:15.580 --> 41:17.161
It's a little late for all that.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.706
You going to the hospital?

41:18.960 --> 41:20.450
I'm going to ride in
with the psychiatrist.

41:20.460 --> 41:21.950
See you over there.

41:24.580 --> 41:27.208
-She going to be all right?
-Yeah. I think so.

41:27.210 --> 41:30.327
Gideon, will you tell him that
I don't need to go to the hospital?

41:31.040 --> 41:33.247
Regulations are regulations.

41:34.670 --> 41:37.116
-You all right?
-Yeah. I'm fine, Dad.

41:39.460 --> 41:40.825
-Elle.
-Yeah?

41:41.880 --> 41:43.700
Don't ever call me Dad again.

41:45.290 --> 41:47.417
How do you think he'd feel
about "Mom"?

41:47.420 --> 41:50.457
Let me know when
you're gomg to do that, so I can run.

41:52.540 --> 41:55.998
Reid, you probably saved
my life in there.

41:56.000 --> 41:59.709
Probably? I totally saved your life.

41:59.710 --> 42:02.531
And I'm pretty certain that
it was caught on tape.

42:04.000 --> 42:07.288
You know what you said in there

42:07.290 --> 42:10.578
That you know what it's like...

42:10.580 --> 42:16.200
The guy was a delusional psychotic.
I was playing into his fantasy.

42:18.580 --> 42:21.788
Go to the hospital.
I'll see you there. All right?

42:27.920 --> 42:31.412
the question that sometimes
drives me hazy,

42:31.420 --> 42:35.379
"'Am I or the others crazy?"'
