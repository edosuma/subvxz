00:03.294 --> 00:04.420
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:04.587 --> 00:08.924
Hi. Yeah, hi. I'm, um, Phoebe Buffay
and I have babies coming out.

00:09.092 --> 00:11.635
Okay.
Have you started having contractions?

00:11.845 --> 00:14.638
Not yet. Um, I heard they really hurt.
Do they?

00:15.515 --> 00:17.433
- Well...
- Oh, my God.

00:18.560 --> 00:20.102
Which of you is the father?

00:20.311 --> 00:23.313
None of them are.
The father is my brother.

00:24.274 --> 00:25.524
Okay.

00:26.109 --> 00:29.403
I'll miss watching you
freak people out like that.

00:29.863 --> 00:30.988
Pheebs...

00:31.197 --> 00:33.824
This is for the babies
to look at someday.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.660
Do you want to say anything
before it starts?

00:36.870 --> 00:38.120
Okay. Um...

00:38.413 --> 00:41.707
Hi, kids! Um, it's me, Aunt Phoebe.

00:42.000 --> 00:45.127
Can't wait to see you.
Please don't hurt me.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.298
What took you so long?

00:49.507 --> 00:51.717
Your cab left when ours did.

00:55.472 --> 00:58.223
We went back because
I forgot my jacket.

01:03.229 --> 01:04.688
You're not wearing one.

01:05.565 --> 01:08.067
Oh, man! I did it again!

01:09.486 --> 01:11.737
Someone has to call
Frank and Alice.

01:11.946 --> 01:14.156
My mom might...
What are you doing?

01:14.407 --> 01:16.533
I've got to get the before shot.

02:09.503 --> 02:13.340
We spoke to the nurse.
The reason your doctor is late...

02:13.550 --> 02:15.592
...is because, uh, she's not coming.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.804
- What?
- She hit her head in the shower.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.432
Oh, my God. She's so stupid!

02:22.851 --> 02:24.768
Pheebs, it's going to be okay.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.772
I don't see three kids
coming out of your vagina.

02:32.318 --> 02:35.404
Listen. The nurse said
the doctor is wonderful.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.489
He's head of the department.

02:37.740 --> 02:40.325
All right. Ooh. Oh, dear God, save me.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.661
I'm having my first contraction.

02:43.413 --> 02:44.955
- Oh, it's not bad.
- Okay.

02:47.333 --> 02:50.502
And so the miracle of birth begins.
And I...

02:51.880 --> 02:52.921
You okay?

02:54.215 --> 02:55.257
Something hurts.

02:55.466 --> 02:58.343
Ooh, it's sympathy pains.
Oh, that's so sweet.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.888
I didn't know I cared that much.

03:03.850 --> 03:04.892
- Hello.
- Hi.

03:05.143 --> 03:08.770
I'm Dr. Harad.
I'll be delivering your babies.

03:09.022 --> 03:12.357
You'll be in good hands.
I've been doing this a long time.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.985
I'll be back to do your internal.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.404
Just relax, everything looks great.

03:17.614 --> 03:20.199
And also, I love Fonzie.

03:23.536 --> 03:26.079
Did he just say he loves Fonzie?

03:26.331 --> 03:28.123
That's what it sounded like.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.000
All right.

03:31.711 --> 03:33.378
Hey!

03:34.255 --> 03:37.382
Am I late?
Nobody came out yet, right?

03:37.759 --> 03:40.385
No, we haven't started yet.
Where's Alice?

03:40.595 --> 03:43.972
Uh, Delaware. Until she gets here,
I'll be your coach.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.184
Don't worry. She told me
about the LaMazda stuff.

03:48.102 --> 03:50.646
If you get the babies out
by month's end...

03:50.855 --> 03:52.731
...you get two percent financing.

03:53.399 --> 03:54.441
Yeah.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.572
Monica, you're going to be
very proud of me.

04:00.782 --> 04:04.409
I just got us dates with two
unbelievably cute nurses.

04:04.619 --> 04:05.953
Oh, my.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.206
They're male nurses.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.291
Heh, heh. Not in my head.

04:12.001 --> 04:15.671
They want to take us out Saturday night.
What do you say?

04:15.838 --> 04:18.714
Um...

04:21.386 --> 04:23.387
- I don't think so.
- What?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.097
What are you talking about?

04:25.348 --> 04:29.059
You've been telling me to
get over Ross and move on.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.395
I'm moving on and so are you.

04:31.604 --> 04:33.105
Why don't you want to go?

04:33.773 --> 04:35.399
Um...

04:35.566 --> 04:38.151
Why don't you give me
a good reason...

04:38.361 --> 04:40.696
...and I'll tell you if it's true.

04:42.407 --> 04:45.284
- What?
- Harder than it sounds, isn't it?

04:45.994 --> 04:48.453
You're coming.
And when they get off...

04:48.705 --> 04:51.039
...we'll go get some Jello with them.

04:51.207 --> 04:54.751
Yep. There's always room for Jello.

04:58.172 --> 05:00.132
How do you make that dirty?

05:00.383 --> 05:02.968
It's easy.
I can do it with anything.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.763
Grandma's chicken salad...

05:14.564 --> 05:15.605
Ross!

05:16.232 --> 05:18.025
Get a shot of this.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.570
Hey, babies, these are the headlines
when you were born.

05:21.779 --> 05:25.532
Now girl baby, turn away.
And boy babies...

05:25.783 --> 05:27.409
...check it out.

05:28.286 --> 05:30.871
This is what naked women
looked like when you were born.

05:31.080 --> 05:33.665
Now let's dive into the good stuff.

05:35.126 --> 05:37.669
Okay, I'm having another one.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.756
This one doesn't hurt eith...
Ooh, yes, it does! Ow.

05:41.132 --> 05:43.050
Ow, ow, ow!

05:43.676 --> 05:45.385
Ooh.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.555
Ooh, I was kind of hoping that was it.

05:51.267 --> 05:53.518
Where are Monica and Rachel, anyway?

05:53.728 --> 05:56.730
A couple of nurses asked them out.
Maybe they're with them.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.357
Really? Male nurses?

05:58.566 --> 06:00.567
Yeah, I was bummed too.

06:01.903 --> 06:03.737
So they're going on dates?

06:03.988 --> 06:05.572
- When?
- I think Saturday.

06:08.117 --> 06:10.786
- What's with him?
- Um, sympathy pains.

06:11.245 --> 06:15.582
It was sweet at first, but now I think
he's trying to steal my thunder.

06:17.001 --> 06:18.043
Okay.

06:18.503 --> 06:20.087
Let's see what we got here.

06:20.880 --> 06:23.924
Oh, you know, Fonzie dated triplets.

06:25.551 --> 06:28.428
This Fonzie person you
keep referring to...

06:28.679 --> 06:30.722
...is that another doctor?

06:30.932 --> 06:31.973
Oh, no, no.

06:32.141 --> 06:34.976
Fonzie is the nickname of
Arthur Fonzerelli.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.437
The Fonz.

06:40.149 --> 06:41.191
All right.

06:41.651 --> 06:42.943
Soon.

06:45.279 --> 06:47.489
It's not that weird, is it?

06:47.990 --> 06:49.449
It's very weird.

06:49.659 --> 06:54.371
I don't want some guy down there
telling me I'm "dilated-a-mundo."

06:56.707 --> 06:59.584
He doesn't seem to be
impersonating Fonzie...

06:59.836 --> 07:00.961
What are you doing?

07:02.380 --> 07:05.674
Why are you defending him?
Just get me another doctor...

07:05.883 --> 07:07.926
...who isn't crazy
and doesn't Fonzie!

07:08.594 --> 07:10.679
- Again, it's not...
- Aah! Aah!

07:17.311 --> 07:18.854
Hey, there you are.

07:19.021 --> 07:21.523
Um, there's something you should know.

07:21.732 --> 07:24.734
Is this about you dating the nurse?
Joey told me.

07:24.986 --> 07:28.613
I am so fine.
You and I, we're just, nothing.

07:28.781 --> 07:31.283
Just goofing around.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.998
Um, I was about to tell you
I was getting out of it.

07:38.249 --> 07:42.085
But, um, if we're just "goofing around,"
maybe I will go out with him.

07:42.295 --> 07:44.379
Fine. Maybe I will too.

07:46.799 --> 07:49.468
Hey! Look what I found
in the gift shop...

07:49.635 --> 07:52.971
Oh. Get up! Get up! Get up!

07:58.060 --> 07:59.186
Okay, Pheebs?

07:59.479 --> 08:01.104
This is Dr. Oberman.

08:01.564 --> 08:04.232
He has no strong feelings
about Fonzie...

08:04.442 --> 08:07.569
...or any of the Happy Days gang.

08:08.613 --> 08:10.655
You're going into what grade?

08:11.824 --> 08:15.410
I'm actually a first-year resident.
I graduated early.

08:15.578 --> 08:16.786
Uh-huh. Me too.

08:16.954 --> 08:21.583
Ross, I should have specified
I'd need a grown-up doctor.

08:22.376 --> 08:24.044
Really, I'm fully qualified...

08:24.253 --> 08:25.295
Shh, Doogie. Shh.

08:27.882 --> 08:32.177
Doesn't anybody understand that
I'm going to be having babies soon? Huh?

08:32.845 --> 08:34.804
Go, little boy! Go!

08:38.683 --> 08:41.019
Oh, cool. You made him cry!

08:45.983 --> 08:50.320
Mr. Tribbiani, I'm afraid
you've got kidney stones.

08:50.780 --> 08:52.906
Uh, well, what else could it be?

08:53.157 --> 08:55.116
It's kidney stones.

08:56.077 --> 08:57.118
Or...

08:57.328 --> 08:58.912
Kidney stones.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.793
You're getting there.

09:05.002 --> 09:07.254
These babies are very, very lucky.

09:07.421 --> 09:08.505
They are? Why?

09:08.756 --> 09:11.841
They'll be born
on the Fonz's half-birthday.

09:14.345 --> 09:15.971
Happy birthday.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.473
Just to clarify.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.350
I'm not Fonzie.

09:23.396 --> 09:24.646
Yeah.

09:29.110 --> 09:33.488
It's a terrific thing that you're having
these babies for Frank and Alice.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.365
- I know, it is.
- Yeah.

09:36.200 --> 09:38.076
- Can I tell you a secret?
- Yeah.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.996
I want to keep one.

09:45.876 --> 09:47.877
Oh, I'm going to be on the news.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.882
You've gotta be kidding.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.719
You know you can't keep
one of these babies.

09:55.928 --> 09:57.929
Maybe I can. You don't know.

09:58.139 --> 10:02.183
I do. Frank and Alice will
want to keep all their children.

10:02.393 --> 10:04.811
Maybe not. You know?

10:05.271 --> 10:07.355
Three babies are a handful.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.816
Maybe they'll want to unload one.

10:11.569 --> 10:15.572
I hate to miss an opportunity
because I didn't ask.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.951
Phoebe, no. This is insane.

10:20.161 --> 10:21.286
Just ask him.

10:21.495 --> 10:23.204
What? Me?

10:23.372 --> 10:24.414
I can't ask him!

10:24.624 --> 10:27.959
Do you know how inappropriate
that would be?

10:29.295 --> 10:31.796
All I'm saying is, just talk to Frank.

10:32.006 --> 10:33.298
Just feel him out.

10:33.549 --> 10:37.135
No. I will not ask Frank
to give you one of his kids.

10:39.055 --> 10:40.096
You're right.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.854
Tell him it's for you.

10:50.274 --> 10:51.816
Feeling better, sweetie?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.818
Maybe a little.

10:54.028 --> 10:55.820
Wish you hadn't seen me throw up.

10:57.323 --> 10:58.615
Me too.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.203
Hey. I just heard. What's up?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.288
Kidney stones.

11:08.501 --> 11:12.545
Ordinarily, we try to break
the stones up with shock waves.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.131
But they're too close to the bladder.

11:15.341 --> 11:19.427
Either we wait for you to pass them
or else go up the urethra...

11:19.595 --> 11:20.637
Whoa!

11:22.598 --> 11:25.850
No, no, no.
Nothing is going "up," okay?

11:26.018 --> 11:30.522
"Up" is not an option.
What's a urethra?

11:33.734 --> 11:34.901
Are you crazy?

11:38.447 --> 11:40.031
Did you ask him?

11:40.282 --> 11:42.158
No, I haven't had a chance yet.

11:42.368 --> 11:44.035
I'm kind of on a clock here.

11:46.997 --> 11:48.498
Oh, Fonzie.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.421
You know who I always liked? Mork.

11:58.050 --> 11:59.592
Undo it. Undo it. Undo it.

12:02.096 --> 12:03.596
Fonzie met Mork.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.765
Mork froze Fonzie.

12:06.767 --> 12:08.935
Yeah...

12:09.645 --> 12:10.729
Yes...

12:11.397 --> 12:14.149
...but Fonzie was already cool.

12:15.860 --> 12:18.236
So he wasn't hurt. Right?

12:19.321 --> 12:20.697
Yeah, that's right.

12:23.784 --> 12:25.201
How you doing?

12:25.453 --> 12:27.871
Okay. Doctor says any minute now.

12:28.080 --> 12:31.624
You know, Alice is going
to be here so soon.

12:31.876 --> 12:36.755
You couldn't just do me a favor
and, like, hold them in?

12:38.466 --> 12:42.093
Sorry, I'm in the middle
of the last favor you asked me to do.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.722
- Hey, Rachel.
- Hi!

12:46.056 --> 12:49.768
This is Dan, one of the guys
we're going out with on Saturday.

12:50.019 --> 12:51.269
Dan, Monica.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.604
Nice to meet you.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.857
Hello, Dan.

12:56.859 --> 13:00.820
I'm really looking forward
to Saturday night. Really! Really!

13:03.991 --> 13:05.283
So Dan...

13:05.493 --> 13:07.494
Nurse, not a doctor, huh?

13:08.204 --> 13:09.662
Kind of girlie, isn't it?

13:12.541 --> 13:14.167
- Chandler.
- That's okay.

13:14.335 --> 13:17.086
I'm doing this to
get through medical school.

13:17.922 --> 13:19.380
Oh.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.926
And it didn't feel "girlie"
during the Gulf War.

13:23.344 --> 13:24.594
Sure.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.267
Thanks for doing that for us,
by the way.

13:34.730 --> 13:36.981
Why wait till Saturday?
Are you free tomorrow?

13:37.191 --> 13:39.067
Sure.
I'll get somebody to cover me.

13:39.276 --> 13:40.860
Aw, great.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.029
Hey, you and me, Saturday night?

13:43.239 --> 13:45.240
- No.
- All right, very good!

13:48.410 --> 13:50.036
This is a big one.

13:52.998 --> 13:55.458
Unh! Get these things out of me!

13:56.502 --> 13:59.671
Breathe! Breathe through the pain.

14:02.758 --> 14:04.884
I want the drugs, Ross!

14:05.135 --> 14:07.762
I do too! I do too!

14:10.766 --> 14:13.810
Yeah, I love you. Okay, bye.

14:14.812 --> 14:15.895
- Hi.
- Hi.

14:16.105 --> 14:19.023
That was Alice's mom.
Alice left five hours ago.

14:19.275 --> 14:20.567
She should be here.

14:20.776 --> 14:22.485
She'll make it on time.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.445
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

14:24.655 --> 14:26.573
So Frank...

14:26.907 --> 14:30.118
Three babies.
Whoo, that just seems like a lot, huh?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.161
Not to me.

14:34.039 --> 14:35.123
Fair enough.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.423
You're at 10 centimeters.
Time to start having babies.

14:43.632 --> 14:45.383
I want only the father here.

14:46.218 --> 14:48.011
- We love you.
- Good luck.

14:48.929 --> 14:50.680
- Bye, Dan!
- Uh, bye, Monica.

14:55.060 --> 14:58.021
I need a clamp, a sterile towel
and Channel 31.

14:58.188 --> 14:59.230
What is that?

15:03.611 --> 15:04.652
Oh, my God!

15:04.820 --> 15:08.239
Oh, no, no! It's a good one.
Fonzie plays the bongos.

15:09.658 --> 15:11.492
Ready? Time to try pushing.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.578
Ready? Time to try peeing.

15:17.875 --> 15:22.086
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
It's almost time to try peeing.

15:24.381 --> 15:26.424
Push. Concentrate on pushing.

15:27.176 --> 15:28.301
I see the head.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.345
Yes, it is a head!

15:32.097 --> 15:33.348
Keep pushing. Come on.

15:33.557 --> 15:35.892
I can't believe somebody's coming out!

15:36.268 --> 15:38.478
There's somebody coming out of you!

15:39.188 --> 15:40.229
It's my son!

15:40.397 --> 15:41.856
All right.

15:43.442 --> 15:45.485
Here's your first baby.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.697
Yes!

15:50.032 --> 15:51.699
Yes! We got a baby boy!

15:53.535 --> 15:55.536
Frank Junior, Junior!

15:56.205 --> 15:57.455
How does he look?

15:57.665 --> 15:59.040
So gross!

16:02.544 --> 16:04.504
Okay. You ready to push again?

16:04.755 --> 16:07.048
I already had a baby. Leave me alone.

16:07.257 --> 16:10.593
Come on, you can do it.
You can do it.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.769
Yeah!

16:20.479 --> 16:23.106
Little Leslie's here!
We got another one!

16:23.983 --> 16:27.485
Oh, my God! I can't believe
I have two children.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.405
How scary is that?

16:34.034 --> 16:38.579
Come on, little Chandler,
it's time to be born.

16:39.456 --> 16:41.541
He's coming! Yes, he's coming!

16:46.005 --> 16:47.922
Hey, where's his thing?

16:52.136 --> 16:53.678
Chandler's a girl!

16:55.681 --> 16:58.141
Oh, God. Kindergarten flashback.

16:59.476 --> 17:03.146
They read the sonogram wrong,
because they thought it was a boy.

17:03.397 --> 17:05.440
But Chandler's a girl! Chandler's a girl!

17:05.648 --> 17:07.316
Okay, keep saying it.

17:08.777 --> 17:11.779
- Am I too late?
- No, no. Everything's okay.

17:11.989 --> 17:14.406
There's 30 fingers and 30 toes.

17:14.907 --> 17:16.075
We have our babies?

17:16.410 --> 17:17.452
Yeah.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.579
We have our babies.

17:34.511 --> 17:36.095
Oh, my God.

17:36.305 --> 17:37.722
You did it, man.

17:39.058 --> 17:40.892
Would you like to see them?

17:44.521 --> 17:46.522
They're so small.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.907
- I'll call you tomorrow.
- Great.

18:00.245 --> 18:03.206
Are you really going to date
that nurse man?

18:04.083 --> 18:06.417
You and I are just "goofing around."

18:06.627 --> 18:09.253
I thought, why not
"goof around" with him?

18:12.132 --> 18:16.344
I don't know if you've looked up
"goofing around" in the dictionary.

18:16.595 --> 18:18.221
Well, I have...

18:18.430 --> 18:22.183
...and the technical definition is:

18:22.684 --> 18:26.729
"Two friends who care a lot
about each other...

18:27.689 --> 18:30.274
...and have amazing sex...

18:32.903 --> 18:36.405
...and just want to spend
more time together."

18:37.366 --> 18:41.327
But if you have this new
dictionary that gets you mad at me...

18:41.537 --> 18:44.247
...then we have to get you
my original dictionary.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.793
I am so bad at this.

18:49.920 --> 18:53.256
- You're better than you think you are.
- Really?

18:53.423 --> 18:54.924
Okay. So if...

18:55.134 --> 18:58.261
- Know when to stop.
- I sensed that I should stop.

18:59.471 --> 19:01.931
- So we're okay?
- Yeah.

19:02.099 --> 19:04.934
I'm gonna go tell Dan that
it's not going to happen.

19:08.480 --> 19:10.356
- Don't do the dance.
- Right.

19:15.320 --> 19:16.737
You're my favorite.

19:16.989 --> 19:19.949
- Which one do you have?
- I don't care.

19:21.618 --> 19:22.660
Hi.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.203
Hey.

19:24.621 --> 19:28.082
Frank and Alice want me to tell you
they're making phone calls.

19:28.750 --> 19:31.627
Did you talk to them
about, you know...

19:32.379 --> 19:35.256
Yeah, um...

19:35.883 --> 19:37.925
No, honey.

19:38.510 --> 19:40.261
Oh, okay.

19:42.264 --> 19:44.140
It was a long shot.

19:46.935 --> 19:50.605
You guys? Can I just have
a second alone with the babies?

19:51.148 --> 19:52.523
Yeah.

20:13.587 --> 20:15.630
So here you are.

20:16.673 --> 20:20.426
Seems like yesterday I was talking
to you in that petri dish.

20:26.725 --> 20:29.477
Everyone said labor
was the hardest thing.

20:29.686 --> 20:31.687
But they were wrong. This is.

20:35.525 --> 20:38.152
Well, I had the most fun with you guys.

20:39.404 --> 20:42.531
I wish I could take you home
and see you every day.

20:45.827 --> 20:48.579
I'll settle for being your favorite aunt.

20:50.457 --> 20:54.001
I know Alice's sister has a pool,
but you lived in me.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.509
Okay, so we're cool.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.637
We're going to be great.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.556
Little high-fives.

21:07.724 --> 21:09.725
Aah, aah, aah.

21:18.193 --> 21:20.278
Well, if you're going to cry...

21:36.128 --> 21:39.797
Phoebe, we are so proud of you.
You're amazing!

21:40.007 --> 21:41.132
I know.

21:43.051 --> 21:45.177
Does it hurt as bad as they say?

21:45.387 --> 21:47.471
You won't be able to take it.

21:49.182 --> 21:52.685
Now that little Chandler is a girl,
what'll they name her?

21:52.894 --> 21:54.437
They'll call her Chandler.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.232
Kind of a masculine name,
don't you think?

21:59.860 --> 22:00.901
It works on you.
