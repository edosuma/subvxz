00:17.013 --> 00:19.138
-Are you dining
with us today?
-What?

00:19.221 --> 00:22.680
-Are you dining with us today?
-Yes. Yes, I am.

00:22.764 --> 00:25.305
-Come with me.
-Okay, okay.

00:25.388 --> 00:28.722
Excuse me. Could you let
this lady sit? She needs to eat.

00:28.805 --> 00:30.513
That area over there
is for working.

00:30.597 --> 00:32.513
There's a printer
and everything you might want.

00:32.597 --> 00:34.680
-Woman: Okay.
-Thank you.

00:34.764 --> 00:36.138
So sorry.

00:38.055 --> 00:40.013
Thank you.
(chuckles)

00:40.096 --> 00:42.180
Oh, and I hope
you brought
your credit card.

00:42.263 --> 00:45.847
-We're cashless.
-Oh, okay. Thank you.

00:45.930 --> 00:46.971
Thanks.

00:48.263 --> 00:50.722
-Raymond!
-What?

00:54.597 --> 00:59.847
Raymond (sighs):
I am going to need
a vacation soon.

01:04.180 --> 01:06.180
Raymond:
One, two, three, four...

01:06.263 --> 01:07.096
Man:
Thanks.

01:07.180 --> 01:09.430
...five, six, seven...

01:09.513 --> 01:12.347
Do you like that?
Those are heirloom tomatoes.

01:12.430 --> 01:15.055
-Excuse me, are you
going to the bathroom?
-Man: Yes, I am.

01:15.138 --> 01:17.555
You might want the code.
It's...

01:17.639 --> 01:18.889
25-85.

01:18.971 --> 01:20.180
Fancy, very fancy.

01:20.263 --> 01:23.221
It's at the bottom
of your receipt.
FYI. It's FYI.

01:26.472 --> 01:28.013
Woman:
Do you work here?

01:28.096 --> 01:29.555
No, I just didn't have
school today.

01:29.639 --> 01:31.388
-(alarm chimes)
-Woman: Okay.

01:31.472 --> 01:33.138
Yes!

01:33.221 --> 01:36.513
-Waitress: You're getting
a little close to our tips.
-I'm guarding them for you.

01:39.847 --> 01:41.180
Crystal:
Yeah, it's nut milk.

01:41.263 --> 01:43.096
How do you milk a nut?
It's dry.

01:43.180 --> 01:45.597
Not after you put it in
something to soak it in.

01:45.680 --> 01:47.722
Yeah, but how does
it get out?

01:47.805 --> 01:50.138
That stuff in your cup
is called condensation.

01:50.221 --> 01:52.930
-There's no milk in the inside--
-Raymond, it's milk. It's milk.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.597
Don't worry about it.

01:54.680 --> 01:57.472
It's when the water
evaporates, and it goes
to either side of your cup.

02:00.805 --> 02:03.805
It's impossible.
That is literally impossible.

02:03.889 --> 02:05.096
(keypad beeps)

02:05.180 --> 02:06.305
(alarm chimes)

02:06.388 --> 02:08.305
No. Oh, oh.
Not quite done with that.

02:08.388 --> 02:10.430
Okay.

02:10.513 --> 02:12.388
I have a yellow one
and a blue one,

02:12.472 --> 02:14.971
but I can't do
blood transfusions.

02:15.847 --> 02:17.971
We both have pockets
on our shirts.

02:18.055 --> 02:19.971
(humming)

02:20.055 --> 02:21.639
-Crystal: Thank you, so much.
-Woman: Thank you.

02:21.722 --> 02:24.555
You're very welcome.

02:24.639 --> 02:26.263
-Oh! I am sorry.
-Crystal: I got that.

02:26.347 --> 02:28.722
-Raymond: I got it!
-No, Raymond. I got it.
It's cool. Raymond.

02:28.805 --> 02:31.388
-Raymond, Raymond.
I said I got it, babe.
-I got it.

02:31.472 --> 02:32.639
-Go sit down.
-I got it!

02:32.722 --> 02:34.013
Raymond!

02:34.805 --> 02:36.597
Go sit down.

02:37.680 --> 02:38.805
Please.

02:38.889 --> 02:39.971
Thank you.

02:40.055 --> 02:42.680
Aw, man. I don't know
if it's the time for cults.

02:42.764 --> 02:44.555
And that's exactly
the time for cults.

02:44.639 --> 02:47.013
It's all about not blinking
and hand movements.

02:47.889 --> 02:49.180
Yeah.

02:51.430 --> 02:53.221
Speaking of upstate,
when am I gonna meet

02:53.305 --> 02:55.013
the enchantress
of the Hudson Valley

02:55.096 --> 02:56.513
that I've
heard so much about?

02:56.597 --> 02:58.263
Well, I'm going up
this weekend.
Wanna come?

02:58.347 --> 02:59.805
I would love to,
but I can't.

02:59.889 --> 03:02.388
I'm hosting a drifter
this weekend.

03:02.472 --> 03:04.055
Oh, no.

03:04.764 --> 03:06.722
Listen, if you're
ever scared,

03:06.805 --> 03:10.430
-the RV always has a key
under the back, right tire...
-Chad: Okay.

03:10.513 --> 03:13.096
...and there's a little bit
of cash in the ashtray.

03:13.180 --> 03:14.930
I've never had
a safe house before.

03:15.013 --> 03:16.388
-Mobile safe house.
-Thank you.

03:16.472 --> 03:19.013
I think you should think about
making this a mobile dispensary.

03:19.096 --> 03:20.847
Yeah, I don't know
about that, man.

03:20.930 --> 03:22.930
Mostly it's just, like, um...

03:23.013 --> 03:25.513
a place for me to hang out
and pee between deliveries.

03:25.597 --> 03:27.513
-Can you do my back?
-I can always do your back.

03:27.597 --> 03:29.847
-Can you just--
Oh my goodness.
-I've got your back.

03:29.930 --> 03:32.138
-Here.
-Thank you.

03:33.055 --> 03:35.347
All right,
this is cold.

03:35.430 --> 03:37.472
-Whoo! Oh!
-What did I tell you?

03:39.263 --> 03:40.930
Nothing like
a man's hands on you.

03:41.013 --> 03:43.096
You got a good stretch
of skin back here, buddy.

03:43.180 --> 03:44.263
Thank you.

03:44.347 --> 03:46.722
-These are the
Great Plains of skin.
-Yeah.

03:46.805 --> 03:48.138
Uh-oh. I don't remember
this guy.

03:48.221 --> 03:51.639
-What?
-There's just this
mole here that I...

03:51.722 --> 03:53.597
-Really?
-...don't recognize. Yeah.

03:53.680 --> 03:55.138
It has a suspicious border.

03:55.221 --> 03:56.555
-Take a picture.
-It's a red flag.

03:56.639 --> 04:00.055
All right. Here we go.
All right. Here we go.

04:00.138 --> 04:02.221
-Aah, fuck, man.
-No, no, no, no.

04:02.305 --> 04:03.971
I got a friend
who says, FOFO.

04:04.055 --> 04:06.138
-FOFO?
-Find out
before you flip out.

04:06.221 --> 04:08.555
All right,
check that.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.388
Don't worry.

04:10.472 --> 04:13.013
Aah, man.
That's not good at all.

04:13.096 --> 04:15.388
Yeah, you gotta see
a doctor.

04:15.472 --> 04:17.013
It's not a big deal.

04:17.096 --> 04:19.388
I think we caught it early
if there's anything to catch.

04:19.472 --> 04:21.847
Oh, look at this guy. Hey!
Hey! Ahoy, blondie!

04:21.930 --> 04:24.930
-Um, do you want
to buy some weed?
-Hey, what the fuck, man?

04:25.013 --> 04:26.472
-All right.
-All right. Great.

04:26.555 --> 04:28.180
-Somebody will be
right down.
-Sick.

04:28.263 --> 04:29.889
All right.
I'll be right with you.

04:29.971 --> 04:32.597
-Chad: He takes Bitcoin
if you're into that.
-I don't take Bitcoin.

04:32.680 --> 04:34.680
-Chad: You should.
-I didn't know
you were crypto, man.

04:34.764 --> 04:37.513
Everything about me
is a little crypto.

04:38.347 --> 04:40.347
-Hey, man.
-'Sup, bro?

04:40.430 --> 04:41.889
Step inside my RV.

04:41.971 --> 04:43.013
Cool.

04:43.096 --> 04:45.889
-Where'd you get that?
-This cafe right here.

04:45.971 --> 04:47.388
Awesome.

04:51.096 --> 04:53.055
(door continues slamming)

04:53.138 --> 04:55.180
(steam hissing)

04:56.971 --> 04:58.722
-Here you go.
-Oh, thank you.

04:58.805 --> 05:00.889
Yeah.
Of course.

05:00.971 --> 05:03.347
-Enjoy.
-Looks great.
Thank you.

05:05.055 --> 05:07.388
I say thank you too much.

05:11.513 --> 05:13.722
Have you heard
the good news?

05:14.805 --> 05:16.722
That he's gonna lose
in 2020?

05:17.639 --> 05:19.805
That Jesus Christ
is coming back.

05:19.889 --> 05:22.971
-Our once--
-Oh, yeah. I heard
that good news.

05:23.055 --> 05:26.347
-I'm good, though.
Thank you.
-Okay.

05:26.430 --> 05:29.263
Man: Excuse me.
I don't know what the hell
is going on here,

05:29.347 --> 05:31.889
but I got the same charge
three times.

05:31.971 --> 05:34.096
-I'm so sorry
about that, sir.
-You see that?

05:34.180 --> 05:36.138
Know what, actually,
I need to talk to your
manager right now.

05:36.221 --> 05:39.180
-Crystal: Absolutely,
if you just let me finish--
-This is ridiculous.

05:39.263 --> 05:41.388
Crystal:
Yes, absolutely.
So sorry about that.

05:41.472 --> 05:43.555
-Man: Okay,
I'll be at my table.
-Crystal: Okay.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.221
(sighs)

05:48.930 --> 05:50.388
Some people are jerks.

05:51.263 --> 05:52.430
Yeah.

05:55.930 --> 05:58.096
Your, um,
nails are polished.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.805
Yes, they are.
What do you think?

06:00.889 --> 06:02.930
They're orange.

06:03.013 --> 06:04.805
-I can see.
-Yeah.

06:04.889 --> 06:07.347
My mom wears
toenail polish.

06:07.430 --> 06:08.847
I think
my mom does, too.

06:08.930 --> 06:12.889
Well, I think she stopped
when she got the fungus.

06:14.430 --> 06:15.680
What fungus?

06:15.764 --> 06:18.472
Yeah, it wasn't cool.

06:18.555 --> 06:21.847
Are you the one
who's smelling like a skunk?

06:21.930 --> 06:23.764
I smell like a skunk?

06:23.847 --> 06:26.971
Well, my mom is
also a skunk,

06:27.055 --> 06:29.096
so I'm half-skunk.

06:29.180 --> 06:31.180
And she had
a fungus on--

06:31.263 --> 06:33.305
She had
a skunk fungus.

06:33.388 --> 06:35.055
-A "skungus."
-(groans)

06:35.138 --> 06:36.388
She's also French.

06:36.472 --> 06:39.472
-(phone vibrates)
-Raymond: Seriously?

06:44.971 --> 06:49.055
You know--
Oh fark! It's--
Oh, shh...ant!

06:49.138 --> 06:53.138
-I'll get you a refill.
-No, you don't have to. I'm--

06:53.221 --> 06:55.847
-Raymond, what are you doing?
-The guy asked me
to get him a refill.

06:55.930 --> 06:58.138
-I actually didn't ask him
to get a refill--
-Go wash up.

06:58.221 --> 07:00.555
-Dad will be here soon
to pick you up.
-I don't wanna go with Dad.

07:00.639 --> 07:03.430
-Raymond, please!
-Waiter. Um...

07:05.680 --> 07:08.805
-I don't know what happened.
I was a total goof.
-Waitress: That's okay.

07:12.388 --> 07:14.805
(keypad beeps)

07:14.889 --> 07:16.138
(alarm chimes)

07:16.221 --> 07:19.096
(coughing and gagging)

07:19.180 --> 07:23.388
Mom! Mom!

07:23.472 --> 07:25.597
The lady in the bathroom
is sick and she's throwing up.

07:25.680 --> 07:28.388
-What lady?
-The lady that was
sitting right there.

07:28.472 --> 07:31.430
Raymond, go sit down
and be quiet. Last time!

07:31.513 --> 07:33.221
-But she's sick!
-Go!

07:47.347 --> 07:48.722
Oh, fark.

07:49.680 --> 07:52.013
(giggles)

07:52.096 --> 07:54.764
(alarm clock buzzing)

08:00.847 --> 08:03.889
(buzzing continuing)

08:06.013 --> 08:07.430
(sighs)

08:08.889 --> 08:11.055
Barbie:
It was a good arrangement.

08:12.138 --> 08:13.805
Sure, it was small.

08:13.889 --> 08:15.971
And I'd only have it
from six in the evening

08:16.055 --> 08:17.847
until nine in the morning.

08:17.930 --> 08:19.971
That's when Phil
would come in to work.

08:20.055 --> 08:22.805
He ran a thriving eBay store,

08:22.889 --> 08:25.180
where he sold collectibles
and what-not.

08:27.096 --> 08:30.138
I had it all day
during the weekends

08:30.221 --> 08:32.388
and whenever he went
on vacation.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.930
I had the night shift,
sleeping,

08:35.013 --> 08:37.263
and he would come in
during the day.

08:38.722 --> 08:42.513
And it worked...
for ten years.

08:42.597 --> 08:44.680
(TV plays indistinctly)

08:44.764 --> 08:49.055
Anyway, he retired
and moved to Santa Rosa,

08:49.138 --> 08:52.597
so I lost the space.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.680
Of course,
I would love to find
a similar situation,

08:55.764 --> 08:59.055
but, you know, life's
just not like that, is it?

08:59.138 --> 09:00.722
Arthur: Yeah,
to-totally, um...

09:00.805 --> 09:04.013
Yeah, so, like,
what do you do for work?

09:04.096 --> 09:06.764
-Oh, uh, this and that.
-Mm-hmm.

09:06.847 --> 09:09.096
-I volunteer a lot.
-Mm-hmm.

09:09.180 --> 09:12.263
-I'm, honestly,
between jobs...
-Mm-hmm.

09:12.347 --> 09:14.847
-...but I've won some
suits against the city.
-Oh.

09:14.930 --> 09:16.513
-So I'm good
for the rent.
-Okay.

09:16.597 --> 09:20.388
And my brother's helping me
while I'm waiting for them
to pay out.

09:20.472 --> 09:23.513
-Okay.
-But I'm used to leaving
during the day...

09:23.597 --> 09:26.388
-Mm-hmm.
-...so I won't be
in your hair at all.

09:26.472 --> 09:28.971
-Okay. Cool.
-Yeah. Yeah.

09:31.180 --> 09:34.180
You... You don't look like
a nudist to me.

09:34.263 --> 09:36.013
Oh, yeah, I am.
I just--

09:36.096 --> 09:38.722
Yeah, but meeting
strangers and all.

09:38.805 --> 09:40.347
It's all the same to me.

09:40.430 --> 09:41.847
It's nothing
I haven't seen before.

09:41.930 --> 09:44.138
Oh, great. Yeah.
No, I mean, I imagine, right?

09:44.221 --> 09:46.971
I mean, you said
you've been in New York for,
like, a long time, right?

09:47.055 --> 09:48.263
Oh, yes. Decades.

09:48.347 --> 09:50.347
-Like the '80s
or even before then?
-Yeah. I came

09:50.430 --> 09:53.263
through the tunnel
from Jersey and I never left.

09:53.347 --> 09:56.680
-Oh, man.
-1976, '77.

09:56.764 --> 09:59.971
Oh, wow!
Yeah, that's supposed to be
a crazy time for New York.

10:00.055 --> 10:02.013
-It was. It was free.
-Yeah, and I like free.

10:02.096 --> 10:03.513
-Free is cool.
-Yeah, and you're a nudist.

10:03.597 --> 10:05.430
Yeah, totally. I feel
like we have something
in common.

10:05.513 --> 10:08.138
-So, "Free" is
your middle name.
-(laughing): Yeah.

10:08.221 --> 10:10.013
-Richard Hell--
what band?
-Uh...

10:10.096 --> 10:12.889
-Richard Hell.
-Oh, I don't know,
the Ramones?

10:13.971 --> 10:15.263

You get to do it for us.

Yeah, that's done from, like,
the late '70s or something.

14:27.430 --> 14:29.639
-It's pretty cool, right?
-Yeah, Debbie looks
uncomfortable.

14:29.722 --> 14:32.680

Hey, how much are
these cookies?

14:32.764 --> 14:35.513
They're ten. I like them
because they're not too strong.

14:35.597 --> 14:37.347
-Yeah?
-So you can, like, do stuff.

14:37.430 --> 14:39.472
Okay, yeah.
That sounds perfect.

14:39.555 --> 14:41.013
Yeah, I'll take, like,
three of them, maybe?

14:41.096 --> 14:44.430
Okay, so that's
a hundred and ten, then.

14:44.513 --> 14:45.680
Okay, let's see.

14:45.764 --> 14:48.221
Don't eat too many cookies,
'cause they're gonna get ya.

14:58.971 --> 15:00.764
-Hi.
-Oh, this is, uh--

15:00.847 --> 15:02.722
Your drug dealer?

15:02.805 --> 15:04.180
-Are you kidding me?
-What?

15:04.263 --> 15:05.722
-I don't believe this.
-I'm just gonna go.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.221
Arthur-- Arthur,
you know I'm drug-free.

15:08.305 --> 15:09.722
-You know I'm drug-free!
-I know. I'm sorry.

15:09.805 --> 15:11.305
-I'll keep it in my room.
-I'm on my way out.

15:11.388 --> 15:12.805
-Don't worry about it.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:12.889 --> 15:15.722
You be quiet, you leave,
and shave your beard. Buh-bye.

15:15.805 --> 15:17.680
Wait, come on.
Hey, I'm sorry about that.

15:17.764 --> 15:19.555
-I'll talk to you later,
man. Good luck.
-Yeah, buh-bye.

15:19.639 --> 15:21.472
-Arthur, you have violated
our agreement.
-What?

15:21.555 --> 15:25.555
I am renting a room
in an apartment that is
drug-free.

15:25.639 --> 15:29.013
And if it isn't drug-free,
I don't have to pay.

15:29.096 --> 15:30.513
Wh-- are you crazy?

15:30.597 --> 15:34.096
Of course you have to pay!
That's why I got a roommate.

15:34.180 --> 15:35.764
That's-- that's ridiculous.

15:35.847 --> 15:39.430
-Yep, there are
consequences.
-(spritzing)

15:39.513 --> 15:42.889
-What is--?
-And you don't
wash your hands,

15:42.971 --> 15:45.472
-after you pee.
-What? Yes, I do.

15:45.555 --> 15:48.263
And you flop your ding-dong
all over the apartment.

15:48.347 --> 15:50.180
You touch it and you don't
wash your hands.

15:50.263 --> 15:51.722
Oh, I totally wash
my hands,

15:51.805 --> 15:54.430
and if you're not happy,
maybe you should just move out.

15:54.513 --> 15:56.513
The month's not over,
so don't make me

15:56.597 --> 16:00.221
-take you to small claims court.
-What? Small claims court?

16:00.305 --> 16:02.930
-And I'm not going to--
I don't know what that is.
-It's only fair.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.347
Plus, what you owe me
for the use of my water filter.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.180
I can't owe you money
for that.

16:08.263 --> 16:10.180
You use my water filter
every time you use the sink.

16:10.263 --> 16:11.889
I have no choice.
It's attached.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.096

-And it's very expensive!

It's not true!

16:23.305 --> 16:24.472

16:41.305 --> 16:43.096

16:54.513 --> 16:57.221

16:57.305 --> 17:00.138
I won't sue you.
I like living here.

17:00.221 --> 17:04.138
That's good.
And that's a relief, thanks.

17:06.388 --> 17:09.305
You don't have to thank me.

17:09.388 --> 17:12.472
It really is
a beautiful apartment.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.971
Is that moonlight
streaming in like that?

17:18.430 --> 17:21.388
Oh, no.
It's just a street lamp.

I saw the cops

17:30.597 --> 17:34.138
blasting those big lights
into the Village.

17:34.221 --> 17:37.639
They thought it would
scare off the junkies.

17:37.722 --> 17:40.847
It came right into my window
and woke me up.

17:42.221 --> 17:44.639
I was
with a boyfriend.

17:46.305 --> 17:50.180
Anyway, does that
answer your question?

17:50.263 --> 17:52.971
Um, I didn't ask a question.

17:54.013 --> 17:57.221
I'm really sorry about earlier,

17:57.305 --> 18:01.263
but I'm just not used
to being a roommate.

18:02.013 --> 18:03.597
Oh... oh!

18:03.680 --> 18:07.847
And I-I-I finished that cookie
thingy you left out.

18:07.930 --> 18:10.513
-Oh, uh...
-It just looked so good.

18:11.138 --> 18:13.180

18:13.263 --> 18:15.680
