10:22.342 --> 10:23.741
...change anything.

10:23.743 --> 10:25.042
Well, why not?

10:25.044 --> 10:28.112
Well, look at this party.

10:28.114 --> 10:30.314
I bet this is your your
definition of fun, isn't it?

10:30.316 --> 10:32.984
Well, I mean, I prefer scotch in
a lowball to sex on the beach...

10:32.986 --> 10:36.120
and the drink, I mean.
But dealer's choice.

10:36.122 --> 10:37.955
Okay, well, fun for me

10:37.957 --> 10:39.690
is being home with
Trixie, reading her a book.

10:39.692 --> 10:40.825
Really?

10:40.827 --> 10:42.960
Yeah.

10:42.962 --> 10:45.563
And that's okay, but we're different.

10:45.565 --> 10:46.664
Like, too different.

10:46.666 --> 10:48.733
Well, as a wise man once said,

10:48.735 --> 10:50.468
"opposites attract."

10:50.470 --> 10:52.069
I believe that was an animated cat

10:52.071 --> 10:53.004
in a music video.

10:53.006 --> 10:55.473
- A <i>wise</i> animated cat.
- Excuse me.

10:55.475 --> 10:57.942
Hi. I am looking for Andy Kleinberg.

10:57.944 --> 10:59.377
Do you know where he is?

10:59.379 --> 11:01.746
Don't waste your time with him.

11:01.748 --> 11:02.847
Let me get you a drink.

11:02.849 --> 11:04.782
LUCIFER: Keep it in
your pants, Tommy Bahama.

11:04.784 --> 11:05.950
She's spoken for, thank you.

11:05.952 --> 11:07.218
(chuckles) No, I'm not.

11:07.220 --> 11:08.853
So do you know where Andy is?

11:08.855 --> 11:11.189
Your loss.

11:13.026 --> 11:14.826
Oh. Thank you.

11:14.828 --> 11:16.394
CHLOE: Andy Kleinberg?

11:16.396 --> 11:17.698
You're blocking my view.

11:17.723 --> 11:19.990
The view from a jail cell sucks, too.

11:20.015 --> 11:21.666
What, is this a joke?

11:21.668 --> 11:23.334
Wait, is this one of George's pranks

11:23.336 --> 11:25.636
to get me back for that stripper?

11:25.638 --> 11:26.904
Hey, are you a stripper?

11:26.906 --> 11:29.040
I'd recommend you stop talking now.

11:29.042 --> 11:31.209
Jana Lawrence was found
murdered this morning.

11:31.211 --> 11:33.942
She was my stewardess on
my flight yesterday. So?

11:33.967 --> 11:35.690
So you sent her a threatening text.

11:35.715 --> 11:36.981
"Ditch the loser from Lux."

11:36.983 --> 11:38.015
KLEINEBERG: Yeah.

11:38.017 --> 11:39.083
She said she was hooking up

11:39.085 --> 11:40.718
with some DJ named Lucifer.

11:40.720 --> 11:43.321
DJ? How dare you!

11:43.323 --> 11:44.589
"Meet me now, or else"?

11:44.591 --> 11:48.759
Yeah, or else this is
shut off. <i>No mas.</i>

11:48.761 --> 11:50.107
Look, I sent that text

11:50.132 --> 11:51.629
to, like, 25 girls last night.

11:51.631 --> 11:53.497
It's called a "booty
call." You ever have one?

11:53.499 --> 11:55.466
Of course not. Booties call me.

11:55.468 --> 11:57.119
Sometimes.

11:57.144 --> 11:58.544
Look, is there anyone who can prove

11:58.568 --> 12:00.201
you <i>not</i> having sex?

12:00.226 --> 12:01.359
Oh, I had sex.

12:01.384 --> 12:02.550
Meet Sharon.

12:03.509 --> 12:04.901
Hey, Lucifer.

12:04.926 --> 12:05.926
KLEINBERG: Oh, yeah.

12:05.951 --> 12:07.589
She can attest to my whereabouts

12:07.614 --> 12:08.679
all night long.

12:08.681 --> 12:10.615
And she can, too.

12:10.617 --> 12:13.084
Now... (sighs) if you'll excuse me,

12:13.086 --> 12:17.121
I'd like to go somewhere
where you two are not.

12:20.426 --> 12:22.727
- Charming.
- You know...

12:22.729 --> 12:24.495
you and him have a lot in common.

12:24.497 --> 12:26.330
We are nothing alike.

12:26.355 --> 12:27.847
Really? Right.

12:27.872 --> 12:30.401
LUCIFER: Well, that is
clearly off the rack.

12:30.403 --> 12:31.402
Inferior linen.

12:31.404 --> 12:32.570
Not remotely the same.

12:32.572 --> 12:34.338
Regardless, I don't
think he's our killer.

12:34.340 --> 12:36.774
Let's go talk to your friend Sharon.

12:36.776 --> 12:38.376
See if his alibi checks out.

12:38.378 --> 12:40.478
She's not my friend. She's
just a woman that I...

12:40.480 --> 12:42.246
No, actually, that's worse.

12:42.248 --> 12:43.547
Right, where to, then?

12:43.549 --> 12:45.216
There's been another murder.

12:45.218 --> 12:47.285
Ballistics match our flight attendant.

12:55.290 --> 12:57.438
DAN: The victim was in the
shower when he was killed.

12:57.463 --> 12:59.570
Signs of a struggle. Looks
like he was tortured, too.

12:59.595 --> 13:01.064
So Jana's killer had it in

13:01.066 --> 13:03.834
for this poor chap as well, did they?

13:03.836 --> 13:05.469
On the upside, looks like he didn't have

13:05.471 --> 13:07.571
anything to do with this case after all.

13:07.573 --> 13:10.841
Pretty sure you didn't
sleep with this guy.

13:10.843 --> 13:15.179
Uh, actually, you're wrong
about that, Detective.

13:16.582 --> 13:20.017
Raj. So fit.

13:21.246 --> 13:22.719
CHLOE: This isn't good.

13:22.721 --> 13:24.488
What, that a man was one of my lovers?

13:24.490 --> 13:26.523
Come now, Detective,
it's the 21st century.

13:26.525 --> 13:27.858
It's not that,

13:27.860 --> 13:29.760
it's that you slept with both victims.

13:29.762 --> 13:31.228
We've been trying to find a connection

13:31.230 --> 13:32.896
between the two, and so far

13:32.898 --> 13:34.164
all we have is you.

13:34.166 --> 13:35.566
Well, I wish I could help you.

13:35.568 --> 13:37.467
What, you didn't get details
between the sweet nothings?

13:37.469 --> 13:38.502
Quite a few, actually.

13:38.504 --> 13:40.337
But they were mostly
about what he desired,

13:40.339 --> 13:41.905
which I doubt you want to hear.

13:43.842 --> 13:45.842
What if this whole
thing is about desire?

13:45.844 --> 13:47.144
You've been with a lot of people.

13:47.146 --> 13:48.512
What if one of them got jealous

13:48.514 --> 13:49.780
and wanted you all to themselves?

13:49.782 --> 13:51.415
What, you think one of my exes is

13:51.417 --> 13:52.549
killing off the others?

13:52.551 --> 13:55.419
Look, I've seen what
your exes are capable of.

13:55.421 --> 13:56.887
Charlotte Richards, to name one.

13:56.889 --> 13:58.388
Bloody hell, for the last time,

13:58.390 --> 13:59.923
she is not an ex.

13:59.925 --> 14:02.259
Either way, we should warn them

14:02.261 --> 14:03.493
that they could be in trouble.

14:03.495 --> 14:05.529
While Dan's looking
into other connections

14:05.531 --> 14:06.964
between our victims, we should talk to

14:06.966 --> 14:08.440
anyone you've slept with.

14:08.465 --> 14:09.933
Oh, that's a brilliant plan.

14:09.935 --> 14:10.910
It is?

14:10.935 --> 14:12.903
Well, what better way
to prove my word to you

14:12.905 --> 14:14.671
than a bevy of exes singing my praises?

14:14.673 --> 14:16.006
(chuckles) Sure.

14:16.008 --> 14:17.341
That's definitely what's gonna happen.

14:17.343 --> 14:18.709
- Yeah.
- Okay,

14:18.711 --> 14:20.344
a list of everyone you've slept with

14:20.346 --> 14:22.346
in the last eight weeks.

14:22.348 --> 14:24.815
Right, you'll need a
much bigger notepad.

15:01.820 --> 15:04.621
Yes. Bit of a dry spell
the last couple of months.

15:04.623 --> 15:06.523
- (scoffs)
- This is a waste of time.

15:06.525 --> 15:08.625
I refuse to believe that
one of my former lovers

15:08.627 --> 15:09.593
would kill another.

15:09.595 --> 15:10.899
Yeah, well, so far we don't have

15:10.924 --> 15:12.123
any other connections.

15:12.148 --> 15:14.048
And people will go to crazy lengths

15:14.073 --> 15:16.600
for the ones they love,
even if they're the ones

15:16.602 --> 15:18.835
who suggested the split...

15:18.837 --> 15:21.838
and still have feelings,
even though they shouldn't.

15:21.840 --> 15:24.675
What on earth are you talking about?

15:25.744 --> 15:27.210
Did I just say that out loud?

15:27.212 --> 15:30.514
- Yes.
- Oh. Never mind.

15:31.086 --> 15:32.452
Right.

15:32.477 --> 15:34.128
(over speaker): It was an amazing,

15:34.153 --> 15:36.153
<i>amazing</i> night.

15:36.155 --> 15:38.088
But the next day, Lucifer was with

15:38.090 --> 15:41.158
another woman, so did
that make you jealous?

15:41.160 --> 15:43.226
Jealous? Why?

15:43.228 --> 15:45.062
Well, because he basically

15:45.064 --> 15:47.064
used you for sex and moved on.

15:47.066 --> 15:49.366
- Did that bother you?
- I knew what I was in for.

15:49.368 --> 15:50.334
And what were you in for?

15:50.336 --> 15:52.736
The best night of my life.

15:52.738 --> 15:54.104
The best night of my life.

15:54.106 --> 15:55.739
The best night of my life.

15:55.741 --> 15:56.940
The best night of my life.

15:56.942 --> 15:59.361
The best night of my life.

15:59.386 --> 16:00.811
You know, this is actually feeling

16:00.813 --> 16:02.690
a bit masturbatory, even for me.

16:02.715 --> 16:05.174
Though clearly not
the words of a killer.

16:05.199 --> 16:07.294
He knew exactly what I wanted.

16:07.319 --> 16:08.919
- And he did this thing...
- (grunts)

16:08.921 --> 16:10.554
- He did this thing...
- (clears throat)

16:10.556 --> 16:13.090
He even did this thing with a Pan flute

16:13.092 --> 16:14.691
and a butternut squash...

16:14.693 --> 16:16.259
I was improvising.

16:16.261 --> 16:17.768
I didn't have any zucchinis.

16:18.494 --> 16:21.398
He did this thing with
my Tibetan singing pot

16:21.400 --> 16:23.333
and artisan honey.

16:23.335 --> 16:24.534
It's a game I play called,

16:24.536 --> 16:26.273
"Do I make you horny, honey?"

16:26.298 --> 16:27.849
...with some Vaseline and a car battery.

16:27.873 --> 16:29.740
- What?
- That was a move I call,

16:29.742 --> 16:31.108
"Gentlemen, start your engines."

16:31.110 --> 16:33.143
It's bloody brilliant. (chuckles)

16:33.145 --> 16:37.047
Did you and Lucifer have
any intimate moments?

16:37.049 --> 16:38.881
Obviously, we were intimate.

16:38.906 --> 16:40.761
We were <i>hella</i> intimate. Mm!

16:40.786 --> 16:42.519
Did you not hear about
the honey? I mean...

16:42.521 --> 16:43.887
(clears throat, voice cracks)

16:43.889 --> 16:48.392
We're talking about,
um, emotional intimacy.

16:48.394 --> 16:49.926
Like, um...

16:49.928 --> 16:53.730
did Lucifer, uh, bring you dinner?

16:53.732 --> 16:56.500
Or did he

16:56.502 --> 16:58.935
do anything special for you?

16:58.937 --> 17:01.238
Get you a burger, fries?

17:01.240 --> 17:02.606
(laughs) What? No.

17:02.608 --> 17:04.875
Look, it was a rad night.

17:04.877 --> 17:05.942
...and morning...

17:05.944 --> 17:06.910
...and afternoon...

17:06.912 --> 17:11.108
- But... that's all.
- Mm.

17:11.134 --> 17:13.993
I mean, I certainly wouldn't
hurt anyone over him.

17:14.019 --> 17:16.079
- What?
- No.

17:16.105 --> 17:17.998
There was no reason to hurt anyone.

17:18.022 --> 17:19.723
I mean, he was just a meaningless

17:19.724 --> 17:21.565
- one-night-stand.
- CHLOE: Mm.

17:21.589 --> 17:23.871
- It was just about sex.
- It's just sex.

17:23.896 --> 17:24.861
It's just sex.

17:24.863 --> 17:27.464
There was no emotional connection.

17:27.465 --> 17:28.965
WOMAN: That was it, it was fun,

17:28.967 --> 17:30.534
but completely meaningless.

17:30.536 --> 17:31.735
- Just fun...
- ...but meaningless.

17:31.737 --> 17:34.204
- Meaningless.
- It meant nothing. Nada.

17:34.206 --> 17:35.472
I never saw him again.

17:35.474 --> 17:37.307
See where I'm going with this?

17:41.246 --> 17:44.347
Well, look, man, the good news is...

17:44.349 --> 17:45.982
none of them has
motive to be the killer.

17:45.984 --> 17:49.553
Yes. Because none of
them cared enough about me

17:49.555 --> 17:51.488
to murder.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.656
WOMAN: Thanks for calling me in.

17:52.658 --> 17:55.725
I actually wanted to speak with you.

17:57.429 --> 17:58.929
Wait a minute, why is she here?

17:58.931 --> 18:02.032
I don't know. I keep telling
the detective she's not my ex.

18:02.034 --> 18:04.167
MOM: I wanted to tell you that

18:04.169 --> 18:05.435
you impressed me

18:05.437 --> 18:06.603
Really?

18:06.605 --> 18:08.338
- Yeah.
- Mm.

18:08.340 --> 18:10.474
I underestimated you.

18:10.476 --> 18:12.843
I gave you all the reason in the world

18:12.845 --> 18:14.044
to betray Lucifer.

18:14.046 --> 18:15.846
You did. During that case

18:15.848 --> 18:17.013
you went to incredible lengths

18:17.015 --> 18:18.148
to hurt Lucifer.

18:18.150 --> 18:19.416
I did nothing of the sort.

18:19.418 --> 18:21.852
You took that case
just to try and get me

18:21.854 --> 18:23.587
to call Lucifer a liar in court.

18:23.589 --> 18:26.223
True, but I would never hurt Lucifer.

18:26.225 --> 18:28.492
I was trying to prove

18:28.494 --> 18:30.427
that you weren't worthy of him.

18:30.429 --> 18:32.929
I see. What about the other women

18:32.931 --> 18:34.631
that you don't think are worthy of him?

18:34.633 --> 18:35.832
What'd you do to them?

18:35.834 --> 18:38.168
(chuckles) Nothing.

18:38.170 --> 18:40.370
They are inconsequential.

18:40.372 --> 18:42.606
You're different.

18:42.608 --> 18:44.941
He's different when he's with you.

18:48.313 --> 18:49.446
Does that threaten you?

18:49.448 --> 18:52.649
Perhaps at first.

18:52.651 --> 18:53.950
Not anymore.

18:53.952 --> 18:56.453
It makes me happy.

18:56.455 --> 18:58.188
I'm glad he found someone.

18:58.190 --> 19:01.525
He deserves a woman
like you in his life.

19:07.132 --> 19:08.632
Have you slept with him yet?

19:08.634 --> 19:09.833
What?

19:09.835 --> 19:11.935
See?

19:11.937 --> 19:12.936
You're different.

19:12.938 --> 19:15.639
Where were you the night of the 27th?

19:15.641 --> 19:16.907
(exhales)

19:16.909 --> 19:19.509
Hey, listen, man,
you're not gonna, uh...

19:19.511 --> 19:20.677
You're not gonna tell Chloe about

19:20.679 --> 19:21.678
me and Charlotte, right?

19:21.680 --> 19:23.380
Well, as long as you promise to never

19:23.382 --> 19:25.115
touch Charlotte again.

19:25.117 --> 19:26.316
No, it's not a problem.

19:26.318 --> 19:29.920
Good. 'Cause the last
thing I need is a step-Dan.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.212
You say some really weird things, man.

19:41.133 --> 19:43.900
You ever do something
awesome for somebody,

19:43.902 --> 19:45.969
and they just don't care?

19:45.971 --> 19:47.971
I'm a therapist.

19:47.973 --> 19:50.874
Being taken for granted
is in the job description.

19:50.876 --> 19:53.577
Like, for example, when a friend

19:53.579 --> 19:55.512
uses your lunch break for free therapy,

19:55.514 --> 19:57.480
and doesn't say thank you.

19:57.482 --> 20:00.350
You want me to take care
of this friend of yours?

20:00.352 --> 20:03.350
Yea... It's fine.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.641
So how do you deal with it?

20:04.990 --> 20:07.991
I just realize that
self-worth comes from within.

20:07.993 --> 20:09.426
You can't rely on others

20:09.428 --> 20:10.971
to validate you.

20:10.996 --> 20:12.539
I don't care what anyone thinks of me.

20:12.564 --> 20:14.264
Of course you do, we all do.

20:14.266 --> 20:16.299
You know, and that's okay.

20:16.301 --> 20:17.534
That's human.

20:17.536 --> 20:19.302
I'm a demon.

20:20.109 --> 20:21.471
I actually think you're more human

20:21.473 --> 20:23.206
than a lot of people I know.

20:23.208 --> 20:25.093
Take that back.

20:25.118 --> 20:27.588
Okay, okay, you're a good friend

20:27.613 --> 20:29.879
and a great pers...

20:29.881 --> 20:31.014
Demon.

20:31.016 --> 20:33.950
You just need to
realize it for yourself.

20:33.952 --> 20:36.620
Not because I said it.

20:36.622 --> 20:38.221
(minor gasp)

20:38.223 --> 20:40.590
You're saying I'm awesome.

20:40.592 --> 20:44.303
I'm saying that <i>you</i> need
to say that you're awesome.

20:44.328 --> 20:47.443
Believe that you're awesome.

20:52.112 --> 20:53.845
Yes, you're awesome.

20:53.870 --> 20:55.561
Hell yeah I am.

20:56.775 --> 20:58.241
Thanks, Doc.

20:59.277 --> 21:00.243

21:00.245 --> 21:01.411

21:01.413 --> 21:03.113
out of the ordinary?

21:03.115 --> 21:04.447
Did anyone threaten you?

21:04.449 --> 21:06.082
I mean, there was that one girl.

21:06.084 --> 21:07.150
What girl?

21:07.152 --> 21:08.585
The creepy weirdo.

21:08.587 --> 21:10.620
She was always in a corner of the club.

21:10.622 --> 21:12.555
She just gave this death stare.

21:12.557 --> 21:13.723
Daggers.

21:13.725 --> 21:15.820
Okay, can you give me a description?

21:15.845 --> 21:17.804
Well, I can describe her aura.

21:17.829 --> 21:21.234
That's okay.

21:21.259 --> 21:22.899
Her name is Suki Price.

21:22.901 --> 21:25.735
A number of your exes confirmed
seeing her lurking around Lux,

21:25.737 --> 21:28.171
so we ran her description
through the DMV.

21:28.173 --> 21:29.906
Are you sure you don't recognize her?

21:29.908 --> 21:31.641
No, which is strange, 'cause I remember

21:31.643 --> 21:33.677
the face of everyone I've been with.

21:33.679 --> 21:35.879
Oh, maybe she's mask girl.

21:35.881 --> 21:37.380
Let me guess: Halloween?

21:37.382 --> 21:39.149
What? No. President's Day.

21:39.151 --> 21:40.717
(chuckles) Or maybe, I don't remember

21:40.719 --> 21:43.067
'cause it was just another
meaningless encounter.

21:43.092 --> 21:45.989
This case not the trip down
memory lane you were hoping for?

21:45.991 --> 21:47.624
Oh, it's almost enough to make a man

21:47.626 --> 21:49.426
question the way he's lived his life.

21:49.428 --> 21:50.427
Almost.

21:50.429 --> 21:52.162
Well, luckily this girl gives me hope.

21:52.164 --> 21:54.998
At least one of my former lovers
might be willing to kill for me.

21:55.000 --> 21:57.834
Oh. It's open.

21:57.836 --> 22:01.204
LAPD. Anyone home?

22:03.141 --> 22:05.241
Well, this isn't creepy at all.

22:10.182 --> 22:13.049
See? I told you someone cared.

22:21.764 --> 22:23.697
Look at this.

22:23.722 --> 22:26.387
Multiple chest hair options. Amazing.

22:26.412 --> 22:28.014
I can make a lasting impression.

22:28.016 --> 22:31.284
Yeah, on someone with serious issues.

22:31.286 --> 22:33.720
This woman is clearly deranged,

22:33.722 --> 22:35.622
dangerous, and...

22:35.624 --> 22:39.031
Why am I on this wall?

22:39.056 --> 22:41.361
Well, maybe she can just
sense the inevitable.

22:41.363 --> 22:43.229
(toilet flushes)

22:43.231 --> 22:45.064
Suki Price? LAPD.

22:47.135 --> 22:48.701
What're you doing in my...

22:48.703 --> 22:50.069
(screams) Lucifer!

22:50.071 --> 22:51.671
- Okay, hey, hey.
- What...

22:51.673 --> 22:54.774
- (toilet flushes)
- Hey, come out with your hands up.

23:00.482 --> 23:02.815
This is one of your exes?

23:02.840 --> 23:05.601
Do you know, I'm really not sure...

23:05.626 --> 23:07.292
I... darling, could you do this?

23:07.889 --> 23:10.579
And say, "I am not a crook."

23:12.394 --> 23:14.093
No, it's definitely
not Sexy Richard Nixon.

23:14.095 --> 23:16.162
I'm quite certain we've
not slept together.

23:16.164 --> 23:17.897
Well, I could have told you that.

23:17.899 --> 23:19.532
Care to explain the wall?

23:20.435 --> 23:22.402
Oh... I'm just...

23:22.404 --> 23:24.066
really into Lucifer.

23:24.091 --> 23:25.949
(chuckles) And who could blame you.

23:25.974 --> 23:27.617
You're my perfect man.

23:27.642 --> 23:30.543
Like porn and stuffed crust pizza

23:30.545 --> 23:34.113
and my Hello Kitty blankie
all rolled into one.

23:35.228 --> 23:37.483
I've loved you from afar.

23:37.485 --> 23:38.418
LUCIFER: Right.

23:38.420 --> 23:39.752
I see what's happened here.

23:39.754 --> 23:41.954
Not having sex with me
drove her into a murderous,

23:41.956 --> 23:43.122
psychotic rage.

23:43.124 --> 23:45.072
Murder?

23:45.097 --> 23:46.330
What are you talking about?

23:46.355 --> 23:48.305
We're investigating the
deaths of Jana Lawrence

23:48.330 --> 23:50.097
and Raj Daniere. Have you heard of 'em?

23:50.605 --> 23:54.307
I have all of Lucifer's
lovers categorized.

23:54.332 --> 23:55.430
Uh, uh...

23:55.431 --> 23:57.898
here is the flight attendant section.

23:57.900 --> 24:00.534
Here's Jana with Raj.

24:00.536 --> 24:02.599
CHLOE: So the two of
them knew each other?

24:02.624 --> 24:04.657
Raj is Jana's GBFFN.

24:04.682 --> 24:08.050
<i>Was</i> her GBFFN.

24:09.092 --> 24:10.778
A gay best friend for now.

24:10.803 --> 24:11.904
Oh.

24:11.929 --> 24:14.592
She sometimes crashed on his
couch whenever she was in L.A.

24:14.617 --> 24:17.184
Hmm. And w-what are
these numbers about here?

24:17.408 --> 24:19.708
Date from two days ago.

24:19.710 --> 24:22.878
The last time Lucifer and Jana

24:22.880 --> 24:24.046
hooked up.

24:24.048 --> 24:25.714
LUCIFER: Right. Much as I admire

24:25.716 --> 24:27.349
your dedication to this
creepy stalker business,

24:27.351 --> 24:30.319
I have to correct you,
there was no hookup.

24:30.321 --> 24:33.512
But I made a commemorative doll.

24:36.093 --> 24:38.494
You're wearing your new suit.

24:38.496 --> 24:41.463
Yes, what excellent
detail on the French cuffs.

24:41.465 --> 24:43.265
That's what I was doing last night.

24:43.290 --> 24:45.484
Oh, you can ask the pizza delivery man.

24:45.509 --> 24:46.735
He helped me with these

24:46.737 --> 24:48.170
teeny tiny buttons.

24:49.039 --> 24:51.340
Ask him. (sniffs)

24:51.342 --> 24:54.009
Who's the third person in this photo?

24:57.455 --> 25:00.363
SUKI: Uh, that's a
pilot Jana works with.

25:00.388 --> 25:02.050
Those three hang out
together all the time.

25:02.052 --> 25:04.319
Maybe he knows what happened.

25:04.321 --> 25:05.287
Yeah, yeah, I got it.

25:05.289 --> 25:06.655
Look, I'm gonna send an officer by

25:06.657 --> 25:08.157

25:08.159 --> 25:09.525
Do not leave town.

25:10.461 --> 25:13.562

Your Father is the one

We are simply bringing it to an end.

26:18.863 --> 26:19.971
On our terms.

26:19.996 --> 26:22.196
I've tried to manipulate Lucifer before.

26:22.700 --> 26:24.066
It didn't end well.

26:24.068 --> 26:26.201
That's because you lied to him.

26:26.203 --> 26:28.370
Lucifer respects the truth.

26:28.372 --> 26:30.005
So use that to get us all home.

26:30.007 --> 26:32.975
And then, we can put
all of this behind us.

26:37.548 --> 26:38.780
This is delicious.

26:38.782 --> 26:40.949
Mm-hmm. Still not as good as sex.

26:47.057 --> 26:48.991
He's got a record: drugs and assault.

26:48.993 --> 26:50.359
Used to work for a big airline,

26:50.361 --> 26:52.728
now he flies rich dudes on small jets.

26:52.730 --> 26:55.264
His recent routes are...

26:55.266 --> 26:57.966
The Caribbean, Mexico City, Ahmedabad.

26:57.968 --> 27:00.402
Yes, all hotspots for drug smugglers.

27:00.404 --> 27:01.770
O-Or so I'm told.

27:01.772 --> 27:04.506
Working for a private airline

27:09.179 --> 27:11.013
maybe Jana and Raj found out about it,

27:11.015 --> 27:13.161
threatened to squeal, so
he shut 'em up permanently.

(sighs) I only know him as "Burt."

28:44.548 --> 28:47.850
Guy smuggles a lot of
drugs into the country.

28:47.852 --> 28:49.551
So, were you moving product for him?

28:49.553 --> 28:50.183
No,

28:50.208 --> 28:52.732
he uses young women like Jana to mule.

28:52.757 --> 28:54.556
He recruits 'em on the
party circuit in Malibu,

28:54.558 --> 28:55.762
offers them cash,

28:55.787 --> 28:57.554
free travel, whatever they desire.

28:57.862 --> 28:58.894
Right.

28:58.896 --> 29:01.463
And what is it you desire, Tim?

29:07.733 --> 29:10.568
I want to build a cat sanctuary.

29:10.593 --> 29:13.260
Wait. Oh, for goodness sake.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.254
Cat?

29:14.279 --> 29:16.813
I got into trouble
using drugs years back.

29:16.838 --> 29:18.879
My life fell apart.

29:19.704 --> 29:21.671
- But then I adopted Twinkle...
- Right,

29:21.696 --> 29:23.552
skip along, Tim, 'cause
no one really wants to hear

29:23.554 --> 29:24.887
about your feline meet cute.

29:24.889 --> 29:28.090
(sighs) Jana tried to get me to smuggle

29:28.092 --> 29:29.091
for Burt, too,

29:29.093 --> 29:30.325
but I refused.

29:30.327 --> 29:31.927
Then why were you running?

29:33.164 --> 29:36.532
On Jana's last flight,
a package went missing.

29:36.534 --> 29:37.533
A package?

29:37.535 --> 29:39.858
So, what, Burt thought Jana stole it?

29:39.883 --> 29:42.615
And when she didn't have
it, he went after Raj.

29:42.640 --> 29:43.705
And now, me.

29:43.707 --> 29:45.407
Is there any way to
get a hold of this guy?

29:45.409 --> 29:46.875
TIM: I got a bull's-eye

29:46.877 --> 29:48.058
painted on my back.

29:48.083 --> 29:49.314
Why the hell would I want to?

29:49.316 --> 29:51.116
Hmm.

29:51.118 --> 29:54.052
Detective...

29:54.054 --> 29:56.555
in order to lure out our
murderous kingpin from hiding,

29:56.557 --> 29:58.256
all we need to do is
for someone to pretend

29:58.258 --> 30:00.358
to have this mysterious package.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.027
Yes, and it would need to be someone

30:02.029 --> 30:03.361
who might have worked with Jana.

30:03.363 --> 30:04.462
LUCIFER: Hmm.

30:04.464 --> 30:06.965
Uh, Tim, who else was on the flight?

30:06.967 --> 30:08.133
Just me,

30:08.135 --> 30:10.335
Andy Kleinberg, my copilot,

30:10.337 --> 30:11.603
and a new flight attendant.

30:11.605 --> 30:12.737
A new flight attendant?

30:12.739 --> 30:14.773
So Burt may not have
known what she looked like?

30:18.011 --> 30:19.544
I'm in.

30:19.546 --> 30:21.846
Okay, but you understand what
you're agreeing to, right?

30:21.848 --> 30:22.981
Sure.

30:22.983 --> 30:25.050
You want me to bounty
hunt this Burt scumbag

30:25.052 --> 30:26.952
and pretend to deliver his package.

30:26.954 --> 30:28.787
But we'll need you to
work with us on this one.

30:28.789 --> 30:30.272
We'll set up the meet and everything.

30:30.297 --> 30:32.357
Do I still get to rough
him up before the cops do?

30:32.359 --> 30:36.628
We'll be close by,
but technically, yeah.

30:36.630 --> 30:39.064
More in. You want to know why?

30:39.066 --> 30:40.432
Because we're running out of time

30:40.434 --> 30:41.666
and you're our only option?

30:41.668 --> 30:43.335
No.

30:43.337 --> 30:45.103
Because I'm awesome.

30:45.105 --> 30:47.239
Because I take risks for my friends

30:47.241 --> 30:49.007
and I don't need your thanks.

30:50.277 --> 30:52.143
Am I supposed to be
thanking you for something?

30:52.145 --> 30:53.745
No.

from within, bitches.

31:22.876 --> 31:24.442
I can come back.

31:24.444 --> 31:26.311
Well, no, no, that's not a euphemism.

31:26.313 --> 31:30.448

39:10.643 --> 39:12.510
Think you'll find he
feels quite remorseful

39:12.512 --> 39:13.778
about the life he's led.

39:13.780 --> 39:15.846
Please... okay, p-please,
just-just arrest me, okay?

39:15.848 --> 39:16.981
Okay, get up. I'm sorry.

39:16.983 --> 39:18.616
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Stand up.

39:18.618 --> 39:20.751
I'm sorry.

39:24.557 --> 39:26.457
Hey.

39:26.459 --> 39:28.125
About what you heard in the van...

39:28.127 --> 39:29.527
Hey, it doesn't matter...

39:29.529 --> 39:31.729
except something still bothers me.

39:31.731 --> 39:35.699
Burt went to a lot of trouble
for a single drug deal.

39:35.701 --> 39:40.271
Yeah, well... the guy had
a reputation to protect.

39:40.273 --> 39:43.140
You know? One person steals from him,

39:43.142 --> 39:45.109
everyone else thinks they can, too.

39:45.111 --> 39:48.279
CHLOE: <i>All right. But
then who has the package?</i>

39:52.885 --> 39:56.220
How... how did you find me?

39:56.222 --> 39:58.756
I'm sorry I took it. I was desperate.

39:58.758 --> 40:00.324
I'm broke.

40:00.326 --> 40:02.159
When the stewardess let it slip

40:02.161 --> 40:04.495
how much cash she was gonna
make from this delivery, I...

40:04.497 --> 40:06.530
I thought it was drugs.

40:06.532 --> 40:09.066
I was gonna sell them.

40:09.068 --> 40:10.734
Then I opened it.

40:10.736 --> 40:12.970
One of them broke.

40:12.972 --> 40:15.873
I spilled a little on myself. Now...

40:17.376 --> 40:20.578
What the hell is happening to me?

40:20.580 --> 40:22.880
(grunts)

40:22.882 --> 40:24.582
(choking)

40:44.036 --> 40:47.538
Hey, I've been looking
for you everywhere.

40:47.540 --> 40:49.240
I tracked your phone's GPS.

40:49.242 --> 40:52.476
Well... here I am.

40:53.980 --> 40:56.413
Well, we should wrap
up the arrest report,

40:56.415 --> 40:59.683
and by that I mean paperwork,
not some celebratory drink

40:59.685 --> 41:01.986
that you'll then turn into a moment.

41:01.988 --> 41:04.588
(chuckles) Yes, well...

41:04.590 --> 41:06.557
I've changed my mind
about that, actually.

41:06.559 --> 41:09.326
I realized it would
never work out between us.

41:09.328 --> 41:10.694
- Really?
- Yes.

41:10.696 --> 41:16.200
So, from now on, no
more attempts at moments.

41:16.202 --> 41:20.137
I'd be honored to, uh, simply
continue working by your side...

41:21.073 --> 41:23.274
...if you'll have me.

41:23.276 --> 41:24.408
Of course.

41:24.410 --> 41:25.910
- Good.
- Yeah.

41:25.912 --> 41:27.711
It's not like you to give up, but...

41:27.713 --> 41:29.213
Oh, no, I haven't given up.

41:29.215 --> 41:32.349
I had a... an epiphany, of sorts.

41:32.351 --> 41:35.686
You deserve someone worthy
of you and that isn't me.

41:35.688 --> 41:37.821
That's not what I've
been saying, Lucifer.

41:37.823 --> 41:40.624
I know. It's what I'm saying.

41:40.626 --> 41:44.161
You... deserve someone better

41:44.163 --> 41:46.130
because you, Detective,

41:46.132 --> 41:49.177
are selfless to a nauseating degree.

41:51.470 --> 41:53.470
You always put your daughter first,

41:53.472 --> 41:55.272
even though the ungrateful
urchin does nothing

41:55.274 --> 41:56.473
to contribute to the rent.

41:56.475 --> 41:58.342
- (laughs)
- So...

41:58.344 --> 42:00.878
you deserve someone
worthy of that grace.

42:00.880 --> 42:04.014
Someone who knows that every
crime scene breaks your heart,

42:04.016 --> 42:06.317
even though you'd never admit it.

42:06.319 --> 42:08.619
Someone who actually appreciates

42:08.621 --> 42:10.777
your impossibly boring middle name.

42:10.802 --> 42:12.072
Jane.

42:12.097 --> 42:15.025
More importantly, Detective,
you deserve someone

42:15.027 --> 42:17.494
as good as you...

42:17.496 --> 42:19.597
because...

42:19.599 --> 42:24.126
well, you're special and I'm...

42:25.171 --> 42:27.771
...I'm not worth it.

42:32.166 --> 42:36.135
Yeah, you're probably right.

42:44.390 --> 42:46.245
Detective...
