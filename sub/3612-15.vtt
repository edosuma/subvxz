00:02.003 --> 00:03.834
Previously on Lost:

00:03.921 --> 00:05.877
- Dude, where'd that come from?
- Locke.

00:05.965 --> 00:07.751
What if he's trying
to get us to kill each other?

00:07.842 --> 00:09.298
I'm not gonna stand here and do nothing!

00:09.385 --> 00:12.127
- You just have to trust me.
- Sorry, Doc, I don't.

00:14.932 --> 00:16.263
Sayid!

00:19.812 --> 00:20.972
Go! I'll get her free.

00:21.063 --> 00:22.644
No, we can do this!

00:22.732 --> 00:24.438
Just go! Save Sawyer!

00:26.694 --> 00:28.400
I won't leave you.

00:29.739 --> 00:30.945
I love you, Sun.

00:37.079 --> 00:38.535
What about Jin and Sun?

01:18.537 --> 01:20.949
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:21.040 --> 01:22.325
I made breakfast.

01:22.416 --> 01:26.034
You know, technically,
opening a box of cereal

01:27.004 --> 01:28.335
is not making breakfast.

01:29.340 --> 01:31.956
So you're coming
to the concert tonight, right?

01:32.051 --> 01:33.541
Absolutely.

01:34.845 --> 01:36.972
- Is your mom coming, too?
- Yeah.

01:39.016 --> 01:40.096
Why?

01:42.061 --> 01:43.551
You're not gonna get all weird?

01:43.646 --> 01:45.511
- Why would I get weird?
- Just don't get weird.

01:46.232 --> 01:47.517
I won't.

01:51.988 --> 01:53.023
Morning.

01:53.990 --> 01:55.025
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:58.077 --> 02:00.489
- You want some cereal?
- Sure. Thanks.

02:11.007 --> 02:12.042
How you feeling?

02:12.133 --> 02:16.217
Pretty good. I mean,
he kicks like crazy at night, so...

02:23.227 --> 02:25.468
- Jack Shephard.
- Hello, Mr. Shephard.

02:26.272 --> 02:29.639
This is Oceanic Airlines calling
to inform you that we 've...

02:29.734 --> 02:31.565
We 've located your missing cargo.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.280
My father's coffin, you found it?

02:36.407 --> 02:39.899
Yes, sir. /t'// be arriving
in Los Ange/es by the end of the day.

02:40.369 --> 02:44.078
- That's great news. Thank you.
- Of course, sir.

02:44.165 --> 02:46.656
We at Oceanic are very sorry
it's taken so long.

02:48.085 --> 02:49.541
Good day, sir.

03:13.194 --> 03:14.775
It's the best I could do,

03:15.988 --> 03:17.524
and it's gonna hurt a bit.

03:30.086 --> 03:34.045
The bullet went through, but if! don't
do this, it's gonna get infected.

03:34.131 --> 03:36.247
- OK.
- I'm sorry.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.170
They had a little girl, you know.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.550
Her name was... Ji Yeon.

03:56.320 --> 03:57.935
Jin hadn't even met her yet.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.450
Locke did this to them.

04:09.625 --> 04:11.331
We have to kill him, Jack.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.669
I know.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.861
We should get going now.

05:25.284 --> 05:26.990
- Go where?
- Before Sayid died,

05:27.077 --> 05:28.692
he said that Desmond was in a well.

05:31.415 --> 05:33.451
lf Locke wants Desmond dead,
then we're gonna need him.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.392
Welcome back, Mr. Locke.
It's good to see you.

05:54.480 --> 05:55.811
Thank you. You, too.

06:04.782 --> 06:06.568
Hey! Don't you dare.

06:06.659 --> 06:09.025
lt's him! The guy who hit Mr. Locke!

06:09.119 --> 06:10.325
Somebody call the police!

06:10.412 --> 06:12.243
I saw what you did.
I'm making a citizen's arrest.

06:12.331 --> 06:13.867
- Do not get in my way.
- Don't...

06:18.546 --> 06:20.787
I will not let you hurt Mr. Locke again!

06:20.881 --> 06:22.291
I'm not here to hurt him.

06:22.967 --> 06:26.334
- I am here... to help him let go.
- Who are you?

06:28.389 --> 06:29.674
You wanna know who I am?

06:59.336 --> 07:01.292
You sure this is a shortcut?

07:02.172 --> 07:04.788
I lived in these houses
a long time, Miles.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.669
I think I can remember
how to get there.

07:06.760 --> 07:09.593
Well, I lived in these houses
30 years before you did,

07:09.680 --> 07:13.013
othenNise known as last week, and
l have no idea where the hell we are.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.432
Guess it's a good thing
you're following me.

07:16.520 --> 07:19.136
Mind if I ask how much explosive
you have access to, Ben?

07:19.231 --> 07:21.688
More than enough to destroy
the plane ten times over

07:21.775 --> 07:23.606
and keep it from leaving this island.

07:24.695 --> 07:26.401
Been a long time, sure it's still there?

07:26.488 --> 07:30.231
lt's C-4, Richard.
I put some thought into hiding it.

07:30.326 --> 07:31.816
Let me guess, cookie jar.

07:31.910 --> 07:34.287
Don't be ridiculous.

07:34.371 --> 07:37.033
It's in my secret room
behind the bookcase.

07:59.563 --> 08:00.894
What's wrong?

08:02.024 --> 08:05.141
It's just, I, you know,
I get wonky around dead stuff.

08:05.235 --> 08:07.226
Do you have something
you wanna share, Miles?

08:09.365 --> 08:10.775
- I don't think...
- What is it?

08:10.866 --> 08:12.322
lt's Alex.

08:15.079 --> 08:16.535
It's your daughter.

08:26.340 --> 08:29.628
After you left, | buried her.

08:37.976 --> 08:39.557
Thank you, Richard.

09:09.133 --> 09:10.964
What's that? A secreter room?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.463
It's where l was told
I could summon the monster.

09:14.471 --> 09:17.429
That's before I realized that
it was the one summoning me.

09:30.279 --> 09:33.237
OK. Richard, it's your idea.

09:33.323 --> 09:35.814
Are we looking to cripple the plane
or blow it to hell?

09:37.703 --> 09:39.819
Blow it to hell.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.904
Then we'd better take it all.

09:57.973 --> 09:59.133
Don't move!

09:59.224 --> 10:01.135
Show me your hands.

10:01.226 --> 10:03.342
Calm down. It's... OK.

10:05.314 --> 10:08.056
- Who the hell are you?
- She's with me.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.444
Hello, Benjamin.

10:12.696 --> 10:13.902
May I come in?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.537
What are you doing here?

10:25.626 --> 10:26.911
Put the gun down, Benjamin.

10:27.503 --> 10:30.916
Go to the dock. Take out equipment
from the outrigger and then sink it.

10:31.006 --> 10:32.917
- You got it.
- She's not going anywhere.

10:33.008 --> 10:35.294
- If you don't answer me, I swear...
- If you shoot me,

10:35.385 --> 10:37.717
then your last chance
of survival will be gone.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.931
Go. He won't do anything.

10:48.941 --> 10:49.976
What are you doing, Richard?

10:50.067 --> 10:53.434
We're getting explosives to destroy
the plane on the other island.

10:53.529 --> 10:55.861
- Why would you do that?
- None of your damned business.

10:55.948 --> 10:58.655
I've had that plane rigged
with explosives since I got here.

10:58.742 --> 11:00.983
As usual, Benjamin,
l'm three steps ahead of you.

11:03.580 --> 11:06.162
How did you get back here, Charles?

11:06.250 --> 11:08.241
- Jacob invited me.
- That's a lie.

11:08.335 --> 11:11.122
- You've never even seen Jacob.
- | most certainly have.

11:11.213 --> 11:15.582
He visited me, not long after
your people destroyed my freighter.

11:16.260 --> 11:18.342
He convinced me of the error of my ways

11:18.428 --> 11:22.216
and told me everything I need
to know for this exact purpose.

11:23.600 --> 11:24.680
What purpose?

11:26.520 --> 11:28.135
Char/es?

11:28.230 --> 11:29.720
Yes.

11:29.815 --> 11:31.931
lt's Locke. He's coming.

11:32.818 --> 11:34.524
- Has he seen you?
- No, I don't think so.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.602
Our boat is still there.
I didn't have time...

11:36.697 --> 11:38.779
Run. Get back here as fast as you can.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.578
If you don't want to die,
we need to hide.

11:51.628 --> 11:53.789
This may sting a bit, Mr. Linus.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.293
lt's Dr. Linus, actually.

11:57.801 --> 11:59.416
I'll go get you an ice pack.

12:06.393 --> 12:07.974
Dr. Linus?

12:10.981 --> 12:12.391
Are you all right?

12:13.442 --> 12:15.979
I heard there was an incident
in the parking lot.

12:16.069 --> 12:17.445
Yes, I got into a fight.

12:17.529 --> 12:20.191
A fight? With who?

12:20.282 --> 12:22.614
I saw the man
that ran you down, Mr. Locke.

12:22.701 --> 12:25.784
He was back. I approached him,
and hejust...

12:25.871 --> 12:27.407
...attacked me.

12:28.999 --> 12:31.206
And then the strangest thing happened.

12:31.293 --> 12:33.249
While he was beating me, I think...

12:33.337 --> 12:35.328
I think I saw something.

12:37.007 --> 12:39.794
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

12:39.885 --> 12:42.672
- You may not want to do that.
- Well, why wouldn't I want to?

12:44.181 --> 12:46.763
The man told me that
he wasn't trying to hurt you.

12:47.684 --> 12:50.426
He told me that he was trying
to get you to let go.

12:50.520 --> 12:51.930
LAPD.

12:52.606 --> 12:56.519
- And for some reason, I believed him.
- Hello? LAPD.

12:56.610 --> 12:59.272
Do you have any idea what he was
talking about, Mr. Locke?

13:00.489 --> 13:02.320
Does that mean something to you?

13:08.997 --> 13:11.158
Hello? LAPD.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.282
Excuse me.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.375
I'd like to see a detective, please.

13:19.967 --> 13:23.130
What's with the getup?
Somebody die?

13:23.220 --> 13:25.006
The benefit at my dad's museum?

13:25.097 --> 13:27.429
The concert I've been
telling you about all week?

13:27.516 --> 13:29.256
- Ring a bell?
- Yeah.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.808
- It's all I've been thinking about.
- You can be my date.

13:31.895 --> 13:33.760
That red-headed chick that hates me
gonna be there?

13:33.855 --> 13:37.518
- Charlotte. Yeah.
- Yeah, pass.

13:37.609 --> 13:41.101
Detective Ford, this guy's
got somethin' to tell ya.

13:41.613 --> 13:42.898
Yeah?

13:45.909 --> 13:48.321
There was a hit and run
a few days ago

13:48.412 --> 13:49.652
at Washington Tustin High School.

13:51.248 --> 13:55.036
And then this morning
one of the teachers there was...

13:55.127 --> 13:58.915
...was beaten badly by the...
by the same suspect.

13:59.715 --> 14:00.750
Yeah? And?

14:04.594 --> 14:05.629
I'm the suspect.

14:15.439 --> 14:18.681
Thanks for saving the taxpayers
the trouble of hunting you down.

14:19.234 --> 14:20.940
You're welcome.

14:27.242 --> 14:28.698
Good afternoon.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.002
And how are you doing today?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.208
Terrific.

14:47.804 --> 14:50.216
Any idea exactly where this well is?

14:50.307 --> 14:53.140
Sayid said it was close to our camp.
We're about an hour away.

14:55.395 --> 14:58.558
lf Locke wanted Desmond dead,
why didn't he just kill him?

14:59.399 --> 15:02.482
Who knows?
Maybe it's one of his rules.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.436
The bomb on the sub.

15:08.950 --> 15:10.326
You said he couldn't kill us.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.039
I've been wrong before.

15:21.296 --> 15:23.252
I killed them, didn't I?

15:25.425 --> 15:26.710
No.

15:27.844 --> 15:29.095
He killed them.

15:54.121 --> 15:57.238
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

15:58.291 --> 15:59.872
OK.

16:08.218 --> 16:11.631
- Give me the ashes.
- What? Who are you?

16:11.721 --> 16:14.884
Give me the ashes you took
from llana's things after she died.

16:14.975 --> 16:16.715
I know they're in your pocket.

16:19.104 --> 16:20.765
- Why?
- Because they're mine.

16:22.023 --> 16:23.433
What do you want 'em for?

16:24.484 --> 16:25.690
Hey!

16:47.299 --> 16:50.006
- Hello, Hugo.
- Dude.

16:52.304 --> 16:53.885
I've been waiting for you to show up.
Where you been?

16:53.972 --> 16:56.054
Doesn't matter. I'm here now.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.720
Did you see a kid run by here
with your ashes?

17:02.439 --> 17:04.930
My ashes are right there
in that fire.

17:06.985 --> 17:08.976
When it burns out,
you'll never see me again.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.980
- What?
- You should get your friends.

17:14.117 --> 17:15.948
We're very close to the end, Hugo.

17:40.227 --> 17:42.593
- Charles, let's go.
- There's no time.

17:42.687 --> 17:44.518
Linus has a hidden room. Come on.

17:46.024 --> 17:48.481
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm not interested in hiding.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.560
He's gonna find me sooner or later.
I'd rather have it over with.

17:51.655 --> 17:54.271
These are both great plans,
but I'm gonna go with surviving.

17:54.366 --> 17:56.607
If you need us, we'll be running
through the jungle.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.111
Miles, wait.

17:59.287 --> 18:00.902
- Give me your walkie-talkies.
- Why?

18:00.997 --> 18:02.203
Because I asked.

18:06.670 --> 18:08.001
Thank you.

18:08.964 --> 18:11.501
- In case I need you.
- He's gonna kill you. You know that?

18:11.591 --> 18:13.331
Then I guess this is goodbye.

18:17.806 --> 18:20.343
Care to join me outside
while I wait for the inevitable?

18:24.312 --> 18:27.099
I'm gonna talk to him.
I know this man.

18:27.190 --> 18:30.227
All he wants is for me to join him,
and if! can get him to leave with me,

18:30.318 --> 18:31.728
maybe that'll give you a chance.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.689
Good luck with that.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.264
Just the man l was looking for.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.434
Well, you found me.

19:52.567 --> 19:54.353
Can I get you a glass of lemonade?

20:07.290 --> 20:08.621
I need you...

20:09.709 --> 20:11.916
...to kill some people for me, Ben.

20:12.003 --> 20:14.870
And why would I do that?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.216
Because once I leave this island,

20:18.468 --> 20:19.958
you can have it all to yourself.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.506
- All right.
- Good.

20:27.310 --> 20:30.518
Now... whose outrigger is that
down at the dock?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.893
I believe it's Charles Widmore's.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.441
And do you know
where I might find him?

20:40.240 --> 20:41.980
He's hiding in my closet.

20:54.504 --> 20:57.496
Oh, my God. Hey, Dr. Linus.

20:58.174 --> 20:59.505
Hello, Alex.

21:00.218 --> 21:01.424
Oh, my God. What happened?

21:01.511 --> 21:04.423
I found myself confronting someone
that had a bit of a temper.

21:04.514 --> 21:07.426
What? Why would someone
want to hurt you?

21:07.517 --> 21:09.929
You're, like, the nicest guy ever.

21:10.019 --> 21:12.146
I guess they had me confused
with somebody else.

21:12.897 --> 21:16.765
Well, you shouldn't be driving.
My mom's waiting for me over there.

21:16.860 --> 21:18.350
Let us give you a ride home.

21:18.445 --> 21:20.436
No. I'm not going
to be any trouble to you.

21:20.530 --> 21:23.237
Dr. Linus, please.

21:23.324 --> 21:26.987
You've got one hand.
You look like Napoleon.

21:27.787 --> 21:28.993
Excellent point.

21:30.665 --> 21:32.371
Hey, Mom!

21:32.459 --> 21:35.576
Is it OK if we give
Dr. Linus a ride home?

21:38.381 --> 21:41.623
Of course. After everything
you have done for my daughter,

21:41.718 --> 21:44.334
a ride is the least we can do.

21:44.429 --> 21:45.885
l'm Danielle.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.554
Benjamin Linus.

21:48.641 --> 21:51.178
Hey, Mom, can Dr. Linus
come over for dinner?

21:51.269 --> 21:53.476
- lt's coq au vin night.
- That's really not...

21:53.563 --> 21:56.771
No, we insist,
even if we have to kidnap you.

21:57.775 --> 21:59.060
Here, please.

22:04.240 --> 22:05.946
Do you mind getting that plate?

22:09.078 --> 22:11.694
Dr. Linus... Thank you.

22:13.416 --> 22:17.159
It's so nice to be able
to cook for someone other than Alex.

22:18.588 --> 22:21.421
If you don't mind my asking,
where is her father?

22:22.425 --> 22:24.632
He died when Alex was two.

22:27.180 --> 22:29.421
That's probably why
she's so attached to you.

22:31.851 --> 22:32.931
Excuse me?

22:34.812 --> 22:37.224
All the interest you've taken in her,

22:37.315 --> 22:39.271
all the help you've given...

22:40.485 --> 22:43.272
You're the closest thing
to a father she's ever had.

23:05.885 --> 23:06.920
Are you...

23:08.304 --> 23:12.013
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine. I'm sure it's the onions.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.138
I'll put in less next time.

23:27.991 --> 23:29.527
After you.

23:35.707 --> 23:37.914
Charles and his lady friend
are in here.

23:38.001 --> 23:42.290
She's armed, but I'm guessing
that's not a problem for you.

23:45.049 --> 23:47.005
Wait out here.

23:47.468 --> 23:50.710
- You don't need to see this.
- I want to see this.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.576
Sorry, Charles.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.040
What a pleasant surprise.

24:18.124 --> 24:22.618
How nice to be able to talk
without those fences between us.

24:25.590 --> 24:28.627
- And who might you be?
- Zoe.

24:28.718 --> 24:31.130
- My name is Zoe...
- Don't talk to him. Don't say anything.

24:36.059 --> 24:38.550
- Why would you do that?
- You told her not to talk to me.

24:38.645 --> 24:40.431
That made her pointless.

24:41.564 --> 24:44.931
Now, Charles,
it's clear you're not afraid to die.

24:45.026 --> 24:48.689
So there's only one way to motivate you
to tell me what I want to know.

24:51.616 --> 24:55.529
Soon, this will all be over.
I'll get what I want.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.656
And I'll finally leave this island.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.283
And when I do,

24:59.374 --> 25:03.037
the first thing I'm going to do
is kill your daughter.

25:04.962 --> 25:06.577
Penny.

25:06.673 --> 25:08.629
You'll kill her
whether I talk to you or not.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.207
No, I won't.

25:11.302 --> 25:13.714
I give you my word.

25:16.432 --> 25:18.047
And I'm supposed to take your word?

25:18.142 --> 25:21.259
You tell me why you came back here,
and I won't hurt your daughter.

25:24.440 --> 25:28.433
I brought Desmond Hume back here

25:28.528 --> 25:31.770
because of his unique resistance
to electromagnetism.

25:33.324 --> 25:35.986
He was a measure of last resort.

25:39.330 --> 25:42.163
- What do you mean, "last resort?"
- I'm not saying more in front of him.

25:50.925 --> 25:53.166
Well, then whisper to me.

26:10.653 --> 26:13.895
He doesn't get to save his daughter.

26:20.538 --> 26:23.951
Ben... you never cease to amaze me.

26:25.334 --> 26:27.586
Fortunately, he told me
what I needed to know.

26:27.670 --> 26:32.209
- So... no harm done.
- Good.

26:35.511 --> 26:38.093
Did you say there were
some other people to kill?

26:55.782 --> 26:58.990
Hello, Kate. James.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.199
Jack.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.832
He's right there by the fire.
He says hello...

27:07.919 --> 27:09.455
I heard him.

27:12.256 --> 27:15.794
- What, you can see him?
- Yeah, I can see him.

27:15.885 --> 27:18.797
Kate? Sawyer? You, too?

27:21.557 --> 27:23.422
So you're the one
who wrote our names on the wall.

27:23.518 --> 27:24.974
I am.

27:25.061 --> 27:29.350
Sun and Jin Kwon and Sayid Jarrah,
you wrote their names on the wall?

27:30.399 --> 27:32.890
- Yes.
- Is that why they're dead?

27:33.361 --> 27:35.317
I'm very sorry.

27:37.490 --> 27:39.071
- You're sorry?
- Kate.

27:39.158 --> 27:40.568
No, I wanna know why.

27:41.035 --> 27:45.119
I wanna know that Sun and Jin
and Sayid didn't die for nothing.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.587
Come and sit down
and I'll tell you what they died for.

28:04.308 --> 28:06.014
I'll tell you why I chose them...

28:12.233 --> 28:15.441
Then I'll tell you everything you need
to know about protecting this island,

28:15.528 --> 28:18.565
because by the time that fire burns out,

28:19.615 --> 28:22.448
one of you is gonna have
to start doing it.

28:37.133 --> 28:39.419
Desk supervisor, dial 4-1-0-4.

28:39.510 --> 28:42.673
Desk supervisor, dial 4-1-0-4.

28:45.474 --> 28:48.637
- You got a minute?
- Mr. Locke. Yes.

28:49.729 --> 28:51.139
Yes, come on in.

28:57.904 --> 28:59.144
Is that your son?

29:00.114 --> 29:02.480
Yes. That's last Thanksgiving.

29:02.575 --> 29:06.659
- He looks just like you.
- Don't tell him that.

29:10.583 --> 29:12.665
So what can I do for you, Mr. Locke?

29:17.173 --> 29:20.415
Dr. Shephard, you and l were on
the same plane from Sydney.

29:21.594 --> 29:23.880
You gave me your card, and...

29:24.805 --> 29:27.262
...next day, I threw it away.
No offense.

29:27.350 --> 29:29.841
- None taken.
- Anyway...

29:31.062 --> 29:33.599
Then a few days later,
I get hit by a car.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.977
And of all the doctors in Los Angeles,
I ended up with you.

29:38.361 --> 29:41.524
Then after you saved my life,

29:41.614 --> 29:44.026
you still wanna fix me, and I still...

29:45.284 --> 29:46.740
...don't wanna be fixed.

29:48.329 --> 29:50.240
OK. Then...

29:51.958 --> 29:54.199
The man who ran me down

29:54.293 --> 29:57.035
shows up at my school today again.

29:58.005 --> 29:59.711
He beat up a teacher
in the parking lot.

29:59.799 --> 30:01.835
But do you know what he said to him?

30:01.926 --> 30:04.633
He said that he wasn't there to hurt me.

30:04.720 --> 30:07.757
He was there to help me "let go,"

30:09.392 --> 30:11.883
which is exactly the same thing
that you said to me

30:11.978 --> 30:13.843
the last time you and I saw
each other.

30:16.732 --> 30:20.566
I'm sorry. Are you saying
that I sent this man to run you down?

30:20.653 --> 30:21.938
No, no.

30:23.239 --> 30:24.820
But what if all this...

30:29.412 --> 30:31.368
Maybe this is happening
for a reason.

30:35.251 --> 30:36.991
Maybe you're supposed to fix me.

30:37.086 --> 30:38.667
Mr. Locke, I want to fix you,

30:38.754 --> 30:42.542
but I think you're mistaking
coincidence for fate.

30:42.633 --> 30:44.840
You can call it whatever
you want, but here I am,

30:46.012 --> 30:47.172
and l...

30:51.600 --> 30:54.012
I think I'm ready
to get out of this chair.

31:02.278 --> 31:04.109
I don't really know where to start.

31:05.614 --> 31:08.071
How about with why
you brought us to the island?

31:11.912 --> 31:15.040
I brought all of you here
because I made a mistake.

31:17.626 --> 31:19.708
A mistake I made
a very long time ago,

31:19.795 --> 31:20.830
and now because of that,

31:20.921 --> 31:24.049
there's a very good chance
that every single one of you

31:24.133 --> 31:26.966
and everyone you've ever
cared about is going to die.

31:27.053 --> 31:28.293
What mistake?

31:31.140 --> 31:33.301
You call him "the monster."

31:35.311 --> 31:37.643
But I'm responsible
for what happened to him.

31:40.191 --> 31:41.681
I made him that way.

31:41.776 --> 31:45.689
And ever since then,
he's been trying to kill me.

31:47.490 --> 31:49.731
It was only a matter of time
before he figured out how,

31:49.825 --> 31:53.534
and when he did,
someone would have to replace me.

31:57.458 --> 31:59.323
And that's why I brought you all here.

31:59.418 --> 32:00.919
Tell me something, Jacob.

32:01.003 --> 32:04.086
Why do I gotta be punished
for your mistake?

32:04.173 --> 32:06.835
What made you think
you can mess with my life?

32:06.926 --> 32:10.043
l was doin' just fine till you
dragged my ass to this damn rock.

32:10.137 --> 32:11.513
No, you weren't.

32:14.975 --> 32:16.101
None of you were.

32:17.978 --> 32:20.890
I didn't pluck any of you
out of a happy existence.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.643
You were all flawed.

32:28.280 --> 32:31.192
I chose you because you were like me.

32:31.784 --> 32:33.445
You were all alone.

32:35.079 --> 32:37.946
You were all looking for something
that you couldn't find out there.

32:40.042 --> 32:43.580
I chose you because you needed
this place as much as it needed you.

32:44.547 --> 32:46.754
Why did you cross my name
off of your wall?

32:46.841 --> 32:48.706
Because you became a mother.

32:50.970 --> 32:54.883
It's just a line of chalk in a cave.
The job is yours if you want it, Kate.

33:00.312 --> 33:01.768
What is the job?

33:04.108 --> 33:05.814
There's a light
at the center of the island.

33:07.987 --> 33:10.774
You have to make sure it never goes out.
That's how you protect it.

33:10.865 --> 33:13.732
Your monster friend said
there was nothing to protect it from.

33:17.997 --> 33:20.409
You have to protect it from him.

33:21.542 --> 33:24.284
You must do what I couldn't...

33:25.504 --> 33:28.166
- What I wasn't able to do.
- You want us to kill him.

33:33.596 --> 33:36.008
- Is that even possible?
- I hope so,

33:36.098 --> 33:38.805
because he is certainly
going to try to kill you.

33:44.064 --> 33:47.352
So... how you gonna pick?

33:50.029 --> 33:51.735
I'm not going to pick, Hugo.

33:53.073 --> 33:56.440
I want you to have the one thing
that l was never given...

33:57.453 --> 33:59.159
A choice.

34:00.456 --> 34:03.448
- And if none of us chooses it?
- Then this ends very badly.

34:11.175 --> 34:12.756
I'll do it.

34:17.806 --> 34:19.387
This is why I'm here.

34:20.017 --> 34:21.382
This is...

34:22.728 --> 34:24.844
This is what I'm supposed to do.

34:24.939 --> 34:26.895
Is that a question, Jack?

34:32.446 --> 34:33.982
No.

34:35.491 --> 34:36.480
Good.

34:40.120 --> 34:42.156
Then it's time.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.500
And I thought that guy
had a God complex before.

34:56.762 --> 34:59.128
- James.
- Yeah, I know.

35:02.351 --> 35:04.512
I'm just glad it's not me.

35:06.981 --> 35:10.064
Do you remember that bamboo field
you woke up in when you first got here?

35:12.528 --> 35:15.895
- Yeah.
- Beyond that field, across a ridge,

35:15.990 --> 35:19.574
is the heart of the island.
That's where the light is.

35:23.247 --> 35:26.785
That's where he's trying to go.
And that's what you have to protect.

35:27.626 --> 35:29.708
Past the bamboo?

35:29.795 --> 35:32.662
- There's nothing out there.
- Yes, there is, Jack.

35:34.383 --> 35:36.089
And now you'll be able to get there.

35:44.476 --> 35:46.307
- Do you have a cup?
- Yeah.

35:47.229 --> 35:48.435
Yeah, actually, I do.

36:13.589 --> 36:14.920
Drink this.

36:22.598 --> 36:24.634
How long am I gonna
have to do this job?

36:25.601 --> 36:27.182
As long as you can.

36:59.802 --> 37:01.463
Now you're like me.

37:18.153 --> 37:21.190
All righty. Here's Jarrah and Hume.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.950
The little lady next door is Austen.

37:24.034 --> 37:26.741
Been real nice having y'all.
We're shipping you off to county,

37:26.829 --> 37:29.366
so best of luck and vaya con Dios.

37:35.212 --> 37:38.545
- You could still let me go.
- Why the hell would I do that?

37:39.091 --> 37:40.797
Because I told you l was innocent,

37:43.011 --> 37:45.172
- and you believed me.
- Doesn't matter.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.842
Still can't let you go. I'm a cop.

37:49.435 --> 37:51.266
You don't seem like a cop to me.

37:53.147 --> 37:54.262
Nice knowing ya.

38:04.491 --> 38:06.072
1-F-21 responding.

38:10.414 --> 38:11.529
I think it's time to leave.

38:11.623 --> 38:14.410
- What?
- I said, I think it's time to leave.

38:15.711 --> 38:18.373
- Are you ready to get out of here?
- I'm sorry. Who are you?

38:18.464 --> 38:20.546
He's a crazy person
who turned himself in.

38:20.632 --> 38:24.500
- What'd you turn yourself in for?
- I ran over a guy in a wheelchair.

38:24.595 --> 38:26.256
You see what I mean?

38:26.346 --> 38:28.473
All right. I'm crazy.

38:29.933 --> 38:31.719
But do you want
to get out of here or not?

38:33.187 --> 38:34.973
You just gonna tell the driver to stop?

38:35.063 --> 38:37.975
The driver already knows
where to stop. But when that happens,

38:38.066 --> 38:40.978
- you have to give me your trust.
- Our trust?

38:41.069 --> 38:42.730
That's right.

38:42.821 --> 38:44.482
Because after I set you free,

38:44.573 --> 38:47.736
I'm gonna ask each of you
to do something,

38:47.826 --> 38:50.238
and you're gonna have
to promise me that you'll do it.

38:52.831 --> 38:55.243
- So what do you say?
- Absolutely, I promise.

38:57.586 --> 39:00.544
- How about you?
- OK. Sure.

39:00.631 --> 39:01.916
All right, then.

39:15.604 --> 39:17.014
- Who is Hume?
- That's me.

39:17.856 --> 39:19.357
Where's your friend with my money?

39:19.441 --> 39:21.648
OthenNise, I'm gonna have to say
I shot all of you trying to escape.

39:21.735 --> 39:24.101
Don't worry. He'll be here.

39:37.793 --> 39:39.408
Here he comes.

39:48.971 --> 39:51.053
- Sorry I'm late, dude.
- Don't worry about it.

39:51.139 --> 39:52.595
You didn't tell me
Ana Lucia was gonna be here.

39:52.683 --> 39:57.143
- Do I know you, Tubby?
- No. We never met.

39:58.188 --> 40:01.396
Anyways, here's your money.
125 grand, right?

40:01.483 --> 40:02.984
Yeah, that's right.

40:05.070 --> 40:06.355
Nice not knowing you.

40:09.157 --> 40:11.569
- She's not coming with us?
- No, she's not ready yet.

40:11.660 --> 40:13.651
I brought you my Camaro.
The keys are under the floor mat.

40:13.745 --> 40:15.827
- Everything else is in the trunk.
- All right, good.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.951
- You know where you're taking 'em?
- Absolutely.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.375
All right, well, we should get going.
OK. You're with him, and you're with me.

40:24.840 --> 40:26.080
What do you mean, I'm with you?

40:27.884 --> 40:31.376
We... are going to a concert.

40:40.564 --> 40:41.849
Let's go.

40:48.530 --> 40:52.364
- Hey, can I ask you something?
- Shoot.

40:53.368 --> 40:56.405
If you can turn yourself
into smoke whenever you want,

40:56.496 --> 40:58.157
why do you bother walking?

40:58.665 --> 41:01.623
I like the feel of my feet
on the ground.

41:01.710 --> 41:04.167
Reminds me that l was human.

41:05.380 --> 41:06.756
We're here.

41:16.433 --> 41:18.014
Are you thirsty?

41:23.065 --> 41:26.478
- This is the well I threw Desmond into.
- What's the matter?

41:27.819 --> 41:31.778
I sent Sayid to kill Desmond.
Obviously, he didn't.

41:38.330 --> 41:39.661
Looks like someone helped him out.

41:42.125 --> 41:44.241
No, Ben. Someone helped me out.

41:47.130 --> 41:48.631
What did Widmore say to you?

41:53.512 --> 41:55.423
He said Desmond was a fail-safe.

41:56.682 --> 41:59.173
Jacob's last resort in case, God forbid,

41:59.267 --> 42:01.474
I managed to kill
all of his beloved candidates.

42:01.561 --> 42:04.928
One final way to make sure
that I never leave this place.

42:05.941 --> 42:09.684
Then... why are you happy
that he's still alive?

42:10.779 --> 42:12.610
Because I'm gonna find Desmond.

42:13.657 --> 42:16.399
And when I do, he's gonna
help me do the one thing

42:16.493 --> 42:18.654
that I could never do myself.

42:22.249 --> 42:24.160
I'm gonna destroy the island.
