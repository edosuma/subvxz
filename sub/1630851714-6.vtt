WEBVTT

00:23.920 --> 00:27.800
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:33.200 --> 00:35.040
Hello and welcome to QI,

00:35.040 --> 00:37.880
which tonight
is simply sensational,

00:37.880 --> 00:40.880
so keep your eyes open,
your ears peeled,

00:40.880 --> 00:43.800
your nostrils flared,
your tongue hanging out

00:43.800 --> 00:46.400
and your hands to yourself
as we meet.

00:46.400 --> 00:50.160
A sight for sore eyes,
it's Jessica Fostekew.

00:50.160 --> 00:52.040
APPLAUSE

00:54.200 --> 00:57.280
A touch of class,
Roisin Conaty.

00:57.280 --> 00:59.440
APPLAUSE

01:00.680 --> 01:03.080
A taste of heaven, Aisling Bea. Oh!

01:03.080 --> 01:04.640
APPLAUSE

01:06.440 --> 01:09.040
And somehow still here, Alan Davies.

01:09.040 --> 01:11.320
APPLAUSE

01:12.640 --> 01:15.320
And their sounds are a feast
for the senses.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.800
Jessica goes.

01:16.800 --> 01:21.280
# I see trees of green...
Oh, lovely!

01:21.280 --> 01:24.560
# Red roses, too. #

01:24.560 --> 01:26.160
Roisin goes...

01:26.160 --> 01:29.760
# I hear music

01:29.760 --> 01:32.520
# Mighty fine music. #

01:32.520 --> 01:34.400
Aisling goes...

01:34.400 --> 01:37.560
MUSIC: U Can't Touch This

01:34.400 --> 01:37.560
by MC Hammer

01:34.400 --> 01:37.560
Oh, yeah.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.120
Alan goes...

01:41.720 --> 01:45.560
# Oh, I think I smell a rat

01:45.560 --> 01:48.080
# Oh, I think I smell a rat. #

01:48.080 --> 01:50.360
LAUGHTER

01:50.360 --> 01:52.320
Sorry about that.

01:52.320 --> 01:54.320
Don't know what to make of that.

01:54.320 --> 01:55.960
Now, on with the questions.

01:55.960 --> 01:59.600
What's the main sense that
a typist uses?

01:59.600 --> 02:02.120
Sense of foreboding,

02:02.120 --> 02:04.920
because you're soon
to be unemployed

02:04.920 --> 02:08.440
because of the never-ending
advancement of technology?

02:08.440 --> 02:10.160
That is a very good idea.

02:10.160 --> 02:12.800
There are, as I think Alan will know
from previous episodes,

02:12.800 --> 02:15.880
there are more than five senses.
It depends on how you define them.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.320
There are between
nine and 26, to be honest. Oh!

02:18.320 --> 02:21.480
But we are thinking of one
called proprioception.

02:21.480 --> 02:22.840
You know the oceptions.

02:22.840 --> 02:26.600
Yes. We are talking...
Ah, proprioception!

02:26.600 --> 02:28.160
A lovely man, but a racist.

02:28.160 --> 02:30.080
LAUGHTER

02:30.080 --> 02:31.520
It's also known as kinaesthesia.

02:31.520 --> 02:34.680
It's the body's ability
to sense its movement

02:34.680 --> 02:36.600
and location without looking.

02:36.600 --> 02:39.680
It's why we don't have to look
at our feet when we walk,

02:39.680 --> 02:42.560
or we don't have to look at the fork
when we eat.

02:42.560 --> 02:44.880
It allows the body to perform
simultaneous actions

02:44.880 --> 02:47.320
without stopping to think about each
one separately,

02:47.320 --> 02:49.800
so you can dribble a basketball
while running.

02:49.800 --> 02:53.120
And touch-typing is achieved through
this, through proprioception,

02:53.120 --> 02:55.280
knowing where the keys
are without looking.

02:55.280 --> 02:58.360
The only thing that you really
need in order to get started is,

02:58.360 --> 03:01.680
you know the F and the J have
a little raised thing on them...

03:01.680 --> 03:03.320
Yes, that's why they're there!

03:03.320 --> 03:06.800
I wondered why they
had a nipple. That's it!

03:06.800 --> 03:09.280
I thought they were
the keyboard's boobs.

03:09.280 --> 03:12.400
Jess just texted me like,
"F, J, F, J, F, J, F, J..."

03:12.400 --> 03:14.040
I'm like, "All right, Jess."

03:15.200 --> 03:18.480
SHE CLEARS HER THROAT

03:15.200 --> 03:18.480
You really love texting F-J.

03:18.480 --> 03:21.800
When I was in school, we, all
the girls, were taught to touch-type

03:21.800 --> 03:25.000
and to do speedwriting
or shorthand.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.480
The way we were taught was,
you had a black apron

03:27.480 --> 03:29.400
that went over the back
of the typewriter

03:29.400 --> 03:30.880
and round
the back of your neck.

03:30.880 --> 03:32.840
Then you had to put your hands
in underneath.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.400
I bet all sorts
went on under there.

03:35.400 --> 03:37.400
More than one use for a space bar.

03:37.400 --> 03:38.440
Yeah.

03:38.440 --> 03:40.920
LAUGHTER

03:42.760 --> 03:44.440
POSH VOICE: Well, actually, Alan,

03:44.440 --> 03:46.920
a lot of good novels are
written there, so up yours.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.600
I type so much
now that I think better

03:50.600 --> 03:52.000
by not looking.

03:52.000 --> 03:53.800
If you have to handwrite,
it takes forever.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.960
Have you handwritten
a letter recently? It's hell.

03:55.960 --> 03:59.240
By the third page, it looked like
I was sending, like, a death threat.

04:01.040 --> 04:03.400
I'd lost all patience.
I was just, like, scrawling.

04:03.400 --> 04:06.800
Literally, I can't...
There's no way to sustain this.

04:06.800 --> 04:10.760
I just had to end the letter with,
"Things are fine. The end."

04:10.760 --> 04:11.960
Yeah.

04:11.960 --> 04:14.880
You need proprioception,
all of us do, in order, for example,

04:14.880 --> 04:17.520
to touch your nose
with your eyes shut.

04:17.520 --> 04:20.840
So, if you shut your eyes and try
and touch your nose. No problem.

04:20.840 --> 04:22.720
Oh...

04:20.840 --> 04:22.720
LAUGHTER

04:22.720 --> 04:24.440
I slowed down when I did it,

04:24.440 --> 04:26.720
cos I genuinely thought
I was going way off.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.760
I definitely went round the houses.
When would you be way off?

04:30.760 --> 04:33.360
When is an example of when
you would be way off?

04:33.360 --> 04:36.000
I've no idea, Sandi,
if you get my drift.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.280
Drunk. Yeah, it's one of
the sobriety tests that are used.

04:40.280 --> 04:43.440
There's sort of five standard
impairment tests the police use.

04:43.440 --> 04:46.560
Any idea what the other ones are
when checking for drink-driving?

04:46.560 --> 04:48.760
Walking one foot in
front of the other.

04:48.760 --> 04:51.360
Yeah, so heel-toe,
walking in a straight line.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.240
Standing on one leg is another one.

04:53.240 --> 04:55.720
Checking the pupils aren't too big
or your eyes too watery.

04:55.720 --> 04:57.360
And the internal clock test. Ooh.

04:57.360 --> 05:01.160
So you shut your eyes and see when
you think 30 seconds have passed

05:01.160 --> 05:04.800
and if you're piddled, you can't
do it. You fall asleep.

05:04.800 --> 05:07.640
There is a quick way to demonstrate
proprioception,

05:07.640 --> 05:10.920
so put an arm in the air
with a fist clenched, OK,

05:10.920 --> 05:12.880
but your thumb sticking out.

05:12.880 --> 05:16.760
Close your eyes and grab your thumb
with your thumb and forefinger

05:16.760 --> 05:17.960
on the other hand.

05:18.920 --> 05:22.040
For a second, I thought I could
cheat by watching everyone else.

05:22.040 --> 05:25.120
Is someone undoing my flies?

05:22.040 --> 05:25.120
LAUGHTER

05:25.120 --> 05:28.480
Well, I have to get the fun
where I can, Alan.

05:28.480 --> 05:30.040
Just looking for the space bar.

05:30.040 --> 05:31.640
Yeah.

05:31.640 --> 05:35.280
So, it's along with our sense of
touch, temperature, pain, movement,

05:35.280 --> 05:38.720
it's all part of what's called
the somatosensory system.

05:38.720 --> 05:42.200
So, it's the sensation that can
occur anywhere on the body

05:42.200 --> 05:45.040
as opposed to in a particular organ
like the eye.

05:45.040 --> 05:47.960
Have you noticed, though, that the
amount people touch each other

05:47.960 --> 05:49.600
varies with culture?

05:49.600 --> 05:52.960
There was a Canadian psychologist in
1966 called Sidney Jourard

05:52.960 --> 05:55.920
and he studied couples in coffee bars
around the world -

05:55.920 --> 05:59.760
both romantic and platonic, same,
opposite sex and so on.

05:59.760 --> 06:03.800
Couples in Puerto Rico touch each
other 180 times an hour. OK?

06:03.800 --> 06:06.000
Couples in Paris...

06:06.000 --> 06:09.080
..110 times an hour.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.400
London?

06:10.400 --> 06:13.440
Oh, no, it's going to be
heartbreaking, isn't it? One? Never.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.520
Never. Never. Never.

06:15.520 --> 06:17.000
Not at all.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.480
Absolutely zero.

06:18.480 --> 06:20.360
"Don't touch, eurgh!" Whoa.

06:20.360 --> 06:23.240
But then there's, like, creeps,
who are a culture unto themselves.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.000
Yeah. And they can be from anywhere.
Imagine if someone's like,

06:26.000 --> 06:28.320
"Oh, don't worry,
I'm just being Brazilian!"

06:28.320 --> 06:31.840
"I feel like I'm in Paris -
that's why I'm doing it!"

06:31.840 --> 06:35.000
"I know it's not London,
but I'm a Parisian Londoner!"

06:37.640 --> 06:40.480
OK, if you're a bit Parisian,
I suppose, but...

06:40.480 --> 06:42.640
Only because of QI am I
letting you do this.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.680
What about...
Are the Irish more tactile?

06:45.680 --> 06:47.760
I think we're more hitty

06:47.760 --> 06:51.800
and this sort of, like, "Stop it!
No! Seriously, go on!"

06:51.800 --> 06:56.520
That "stop it", "seriously" - you
push and you shove a lot more.

06:56.520 --> 06:58.880
And here, that comes across
as quite aggressive. Yes.

06:58.880 --> 07:02.400
I think they touch more than
the English on the whole -

07:02.400 --> 07:04.560
whether it's gentle
is a different story!

07:04.560 --> 07:07.680
But you'll be piled in
together a bit more. Yeah.

07:07.680 --> 07:08.800
Right, moving on.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.040
During the Renaissance,
who ate better than a king?

07:12.040 --> 07:18.320
Would it be maybe the king's,
like, servant or, like, waiter? Why?

07:18.320 --> 07:21.960
Because I had lots of waiting jobs
as a teenager

07:21.960 --> 07:25.520
and I ate loads, I ate loads
of the stuff off the plates.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.240
You were heading in
the right direction,

07:27.240 --> 07:28.480
but not quite getting there.

07:28.480 --> 07:31.600
Cos they'd have a poison tester
with a king or queen. Poison tester.

07:31.600 --> 07:32.840
Yes. It's the poison tester.

07:32.840 --> 07:35.200
They would taste everything
in Renaissance Europe

07:35.200 --> 07:36.360
that the royal had to eat

07:36.360 --> 07:38.760
and also large amounts of it,
not just a nibble.

07:38.760 --> 07:42.320
If it was just a nibble,
you wouldn't pick up enough poison.

07:42.320 --> 07:45.160
They had to eat spoonfuls
from the royal plate.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.640
If it was beautifully intact,

07:46.640 --> 07:48.760
say it had a sort of pastry lid
or something,

07:48.760 --> 07:51.320
they would have to break it open
and dip bread in.

07:51.320 --> 07:53.440
By the time the poor royal
received their meal,

07:53.440 --> 07:55.960
it was probably cold and
half-eaten or demolished, in fact.

07:55.960 --> 07:57.680
And then, on top of that, it had to
be bland

07:57.680 --> 07:59.720
because strong flavours,
of course, would...

07:59.720 --> 08:02.440
What if the poison tester's
the poisoner?

08:02.440 --> 08:06.320
Genius! There's Murder She Wrote.
The novel writes itself.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.360
AISLING HUMS

08:07.360 --> 08:10.000
Just constantly making out things
look dodgy.

08:10.000 --> 08:11.680
I don't know... Ohh. Like...

08:11.680 --> 08:13.520
If it's like
something with rhubarb in it,

08:13.520 --> 08:16.240
like, you're fine, no-one
would poison rhubarb. Eat it.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.600
Or a Brussels sprout.

08:17.600 --> 08:19.720
There was a physician called
Ambroise Pare,

08:19.720 --> 08:22.080
who was a physician
to four kings of France

08:22.080 --> 08:23.920
and he wrote in 1585,

08:23.920 --> 08:26.560
"Anybody afraid of being poisoned
should be wary of meats

08:26.560 --> 08:29.520
"cooked with much art,
very sweet, salty, sour

08:29.520 --> 08:32.200
"or notably endued
with any other taste."

08:32.200 --> 08:34.160
So... Was he my Uncle Alan?

08:34.160 --> 08:36.160
LAUGHTER

08:36.160 --> 08:40.400
When I was on holiday in Vietnam,
there was this hotel in Saigon,

08:40.400 --> 08:43.840
which was where a lot of the foreign
correspondents stayed

08:43.840 --> 08:46.280
during the war.
And there was so much sickness

08:46.280 --> 08:49.800
and food poisoning and general
unwellness that they trusted nothing

08:49.800 --> 08:54.920
except... bottle of whisky
and a hard-boiled egg.

08:54.920 --> 08:56.880
Those were the only things
that they thought

08:56.880 --> 08:58.840
there was no way you could get ill
from.

08:58.840 --> 09:00.800
I see nothing wrong with that diet!

09:00.800 --> 09:03.120
As a basic diet,
it's all right, isn't it?

09:03.120 --> 09:05.640
LAUGHTER
Keep you going till lunch. Yeah!

09:07.120 --> 09:10.160
My brother and a few friends of mine
served as foreign correspondents

09:10.160 --> 09:12.720
in Beirut when there was terrible
troubles there. Ah.

09:12.720 --> 09:15.120
And they used to go to
the same bar every night.

09:15.120 --> 09:18.080
There was a parrot that learnt to do
the sound of incoming missiles.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.400
All of the foreign
journalists knew this,

09:21.400 --> 09:24.600
and the parrot would start to do the
sound of the incoming missile

09:24.600 --> 09:26.960
and anybody who'd never been before
was diving for cover

09:26.960 --> 09:29.960
and getting out of the chairs
and the journalists were all like,

09:29.960 --> 09:33.280
"It's the parrot."
What a good plot device! Amazing!

09:33.280 --> 09:35.320
It's something to show that
someone's like,

09:35.320 --> 09:37.400
"Oh, yes, I've been here 100 times!"
Then...

09:37.400 --> 09:39.680
SHE WHISTLES

09:37.400 --> 09:39.680
And they're like, "Oh, no!"

09:39.680 --> 09:42.200
And he's like, "They didn't
know about the parrot!"

09:42.200 --> 09:44.160
# Do, do, doo... #

09:44.160 --> 09:47.240
In Pare's time, it was believed
that bezoar stones

09:47.240 --> 09:49.080
could cure
the effects of any poison.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.480
Anybody know what a bezoar stone is?
There is one.

09:51.480 --> 09:53.480
A badly-cooked potato.

09:53.480 --> 09:57.960
Well, it's a food-related thing.
Is it?

09:57.960 --> 10:00.480
Is it something's turd?

10:00.480 --> 10:01.720
You are the closest.

10:01.720 --> 10:05.800
Oh! It's an undigested mass
found in the digestive system.

10:05.800 --> 10:09.120
Bleurgh! Bezoar is Persian
for antidote or counter-poison.

10:09.120 --> 10:12.520
The theory was that if you had
a bezoar stone, it would cure you,

10:12.520 --> 10:16.280
so they decided to do a test on this
and they performed an experiment.

10:16.280 --> 10:18.320
This same guy, Pare,
that I was telling you about,

10:18.320 --> 10:19.640
this 16th-century physician,

10:19.640 --> 10:22.600
he performed an experiment
on a cook at the king's court.

10:22.600 --> 10:25.800
The cook had been caught stealing
some fine silver cutlery

10:25.800 --> 10:27.760
and he was sentenced to death
by hanging,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.240
so the cook agreed
to be poisoned instead,

10:30.240 --> 10:35.160
and Pare then used
the bezoar stone to cure him.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.320
Cook died in agony seven

10:35.160 --> 10:37.320
hours later.

10:35.160 --> 10:37.320
ROISIN GASPS

10:37.320 --> 10:39.040
Yeah. Wait, I'm confused.
It didn't work.

10:39.040 --> 10:41.760
Is that an old poo?

10:41.760 --> 10:44.440
No, it's undigested stuff
from inside the digestive...

10:44.440 --> 10:45.800
It's got the makings of a poo,

10:45.800 --> 10:47.920
but it never got out. Yeah.
It's a poo foetus.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.560
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
It's a potential poo.

10:50.560 --> 10:52.840
It's a wannabe poo.
ROISIN: It's a potential poo.

10:52.840 --> 10:57.880
Yeah. It's not.... All poos are equal
under God's eyes.

11:00.600 --> 11:02.920
Don't touch it.
Wait for it to come out.

11:02.920 --> 11:05.640
God intended out the back.
Out the back!

11:07.000 --> 11:08.280
They were really malleable.

11:08.280 --> 11:11.720
They could be worth ten times their
weight in gold. Who's buying these?

11:11.720 --> 11:15.080
But did they have to cut open
a person to get them out?

11:15.080 --> 11:18.200
No, I don't think you
can go up the back and find it.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.400
Yeah, just have a rummage.

11:19.400 --> 11:22.200
I don't think that... It's like...
That's more like Bollywood.

11:22.200 --> 11:24.520
It's a bit late to
tell me that now, Alan.

11:24.520 --> 11:27.160
You've got your evening planned.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.680
LAUGHTER

11:28.680 --> 11:32.000
They mostly came out of animals
like goats and not humans, so...

11:32.000 --> 11:34.320
It's a bit disconcerting
that it's sort of nestling

11:34.320 --> 11:37.280
in a Moses basket.
Yeah. We do love him.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.360
Now, we were going to get rid of
him at one stage,

11:39.360 --> 11:41.560
but now, I have to say,
absolutely over the moon

11:41.560 --> 11:42.720
with this bezoar stone.

11:42.720 --> 11:44.760
Only a mother could love it.

11:44.760 --> 11:46.680
Royalty would often own several.

11:46.680 --> 11:49.080
They would have some of them
set as jewellery. Hmm.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.840
And then not only was the food
tested, Queen Elizabeth I's

11:51.840 --> 11:54.640
ladies-in-waiting would try on all
her clothing in the morning

11:54.640 --> 11:56.640
just to make sure that wasn't
poisoned as well.

11:56.640 --> 11:59.360
I mean, it was a very,
very big deal. Wow.

11:59.360 --> 12:01.760
Pulling a bra off
and handing it over.

12:01.760 --> 12:05.800
And probably pointless, because most
poisons take hours to take effect.

12:05.800 --> 12:09.120
Yeah. So you'd really have to wait
a bloody long time

12:09.120 --> 12:11.200
for seeing if your taster
keeled over.

12:11.200 --> 12:15.000
She was probably just trying to plan
her outfit as well, though. Yeah.

12:15.000 --> 12:16.840
You like to see it on someone
else sometimes.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.640
"Well, it could be poisoned!" rather
than, "I want to see what goes."

12:19.640 --> 12:21.880
And turn around in case
there's poison round the back.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.520
"Yeah, I think that's poisoned.
Next!"

12:23.520 --> 12:25.480
THEY CHUCKLE

12:25.480 --> 12:27.840
This is Cleopatra trying out poisons
on people

12:27.840 --> 12:31.360
just to see which ones are... which
ones are doing well.

12:31.360 --> 12:34.040
I don't like to call women difficult
because I always question it,

12:34.040 --> 12:36.720
but I feel like that's a difficult
woman thing to do,

12:36.720 --> 12:39.880
to try out poisons on people to see
what they look like, you know?

12:39.880 --> 12:41.320
I like her fashion sense, though.

12:41.320 --> 12:43.440
I think that looks very comfortable.
Mm.

12:43.440 --> 12:45.600
Time now for a sensory demonstration.

12:45.600 --> 12:47.640
I'm going to give
you a hearing test.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.560
OK, let me get
out my little keyboard.

12:50.560 --> 12:51.680
Oh. Here we go.

12:51.680 --> 12:56.120
Now, you should have some
whiteboards and some pens there.

12:56.120 --> 12:58.200
Yes. So, I'm going to play
you two notes.

12:58.200 --> 13:02.040
You have to write down
which is higher or lower.

13:02.040 --> 13:05.360
OK, so I'm going to play this note...
Don't look!

13:05.360 --> 13:09.080
And then this note. Higher or lower?

13:09.080 --> 13:11.520
OK? So, what's everybody got?

13:11.520 --> 13:12.960
Higher. Higher? Hmm.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.640
Higher? Yeah.

13:14.640 --> 13:16.920
Yes, it's correct. It's absolutely
right. Oh, God!

13:16.920 --> 13:18.040
Good. OK. OK, fine.

13:18.040 --> 13:20.480
So, now we're going to play you
some stuff

13:20.480 --> 13:22.360
that has been created
by a computer,

13:22.360 --> 13:26.040
and I'm going to play you three
sets and I want you to write down,

13:26.040 --> 13:28.880
on each occasion,
whether the second note

13:28.880 --> 13:30.800
is higher or lower.

13:30.800 --> 13:32.720
OK, really simple.
Yeah, OK. Really simple.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.800
Did the note go up
or did the note go down? Here we go.

13:35.800 --> 13:39.200
SHE PLAYS TWO NOTES

13:39.200 --> 13:40.640
Up or down?

13:40.640 --> 13:42.800
We only get one go? Yeah.

13:42.800 --> 13:44.440
OK, next one.

13:44.440 --> 13:46.320
SHE PLAYS TWO NOTES

13:46.320 --> 13:47.560
Up or down?

13:47.560 --> 13:49.760
Well, that's very tricky, isn't it?

13:49.760 --> 13:51.120
Yes.

13:51.120 --> 13:55.240
I feel like there's more than one
note sneaking in there each time.

13:55.240 --> 13:57.080
And the third one?

13:57.080 --> 13:59.120
SHE PLAYS TWO NOTES

13:59.120 --> 14:01.520
Oh, Roisin was very
confident with that one.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.520
Probably wrong. OK. Turn all the
boards around.

14:03.520 --> 14:04.920
Let's have a quick look.

14:04.920 --> 14:07.520
So, you have got lower,
lower, higher.

14:07.520 --> 14:11.320
You have basically got
lower, higher, higher.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.320
Lower, higher, lower.

14:13.320 --> 14:15.800
Higher, lower, higher.
I mean, they're all different.

14:15.800 --> 14:18.840
Is this gold dress, blue dress,
but for the ears? Yes!

14:18.840 --> 14:20.800
It is an auditory illusion.

14:20.800 --> 14:23.880
I'd just like to point out that
I haven't drawn a cock and balls.

14:23.880 --> 14:26.320
LAUGHTER

14:23.880 --> 14:26.320
Well done.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.920
Do you want to do it now?
Would you feel better?

14:28.920 --> 14:30.400
I think, in terms of children,

14:30.400 --> 14:32.360
you'd say this was
a developmental milestone.

14:32.360 --> 14:35.000
Are you saying that this is
a sign of maturity?

14:36.200 --> 14:38.840
So, the truth is that what you were
listening to,

14:38.840 --> 14:42.000
the tones go
both up and down.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.480
It is called the tritone paradox.

14:44.480 --> 14:47.120
So there's two notes effectively
being played.

14:47.120 --> 14:51.080
It's like C and F sharp
at the same time. Ah.

14:51.080 --> 14:54.440
And then the next note
is one in the middle.

14:54.440 --> 14:57.080
And the consequence of that is,
it's both higher and lower,

14:57.080 --> 14:58.480
depending on which seemed...

14:58.480 --> 15:00.680
That's what you said,
there was more than one note.

15:00.680 --> 15:02.520
..more prominent,
so you are all correct.

15:02.520 --> 15:04.200
It doesn't really matter
which you put,

15:04.200 --> 15:06.280
whether you put up or down,
higher or lower.

15:06.280 --> 15:08.920
Shall we hear it again?
See if you can hear it now.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.080
TWO NOTES PLAY

15:08.920 --> 15:12.080
Huh. I don't like it.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.760
TWO NOTES PLAY
See, if that was your doorbell...

15:14.760 --> 15:16.720
TWO NOTES PLAY

15:14.760 --> 15:16.720
Oh, you'd never answer it!

15:16.720 --> 15:19.440
It's very annoying, isn't it?
It's just an illusion,

15:19.440 --> 15:22.720
so that it sounds as if,
frankly, it could go up and down,

15:22.720 --> 15:25.120
but what's most interesting
about it, it was analysed

15:25.120 --> 15:28.600
by a music psychologist
called Diana Deutsch in 1986,

15:28.600 --> 15:30.560
and what she realised is
that what we hear,

15:30.560 --> 15:34.040
whether we hear it going up
or whether we hear it going down,

15:34.040 --> 15:39.400
very much depends on our culture,
on our language. Oh, my God!

15:39.400 --> 15:42.080
Yeah, the perception is
probably going to be the same

15:42.080 --> 15:44.160
as your parents, probably
going to be the same

15:44.160 --> 15:45.760
as people
in the area that you live.

15:45.760 --> 15:47.800
People who have
a very much more musical language

15:47.800 --> 15:50.680
will hear it differently from people
who are rather straightforward

15:50.680 --> 15:53.280
with their language.
I think it's fascinating.

15:53.280 --> 15:55.480
It'll tell you something
about people,

15:55.480 --> 15:58.600
just whether they
say it's higher or lower.

15:58.600 --> 16:02.640
That's fascinating, even in terms
of what makes the sound of a joke,

16:02.640 --> 16:06.440
how you play it, the sound
of your voice in different cultures.

16:06.440 --> 16:09.240
Can you hear a joke happening
if you don't understand the language

16:09.240 --> 16:10.480
and the rhythm of something

16:10.480 --> 16:13.000
and what cadence
works in different cultures? Yeah.

16:13.000 --> 16:15.080
I'd love someone to tell
my mum that,

16:15.080 --> 16:17.680
because I've got a mum who's
really desperate

16:17.680 --> 16:20.560
to have somebody in our family who's
really good

16:20.560 --> 16:22.920
at any kind of
instrument or anything.

16:22.920 --> 16:25.640
So now I can tell her I am,
because I do comedy.

16:25.640 --> 16:27.480
Are you musical, Alan?

16:27.480 --> 16:28.920
Not in the slightest.

16:28.920 --> 16:31.200
He's drawn a lovely
dick and balls, though,

16:31.200 --> 16:34.240
so he is still artistic.

16:31.200 --> 16:34.240
LAUGHTER

16:34.240 --> 16:36.560
There are other auditory illusions.

16:36.560 --> 16:39.360
Have a look at this picture and tell
me what you hear.

16:41.120 --> 16:42.720
Oh, isn't that weird?

16:43.840 --> 16:45.200
What can you hear?

16:47.400 --> 16:49.760
HE WHISPERS: I can't...
I can't hear anything.

16:51.640 --> 16:53.640
Anybody?

16:53.640 --> 16:55.280
No, it's gone. Can't hear anything?

16:55.280 --> 16:57.360
I heard it straight away... A little
bit of wind?

16:57.360 --> 16:59.040
..and then it went.
What did you hear?

16:59.040 --> 17:02.160
I don't know. But I heard noise...
Like I heard... Like a thudding?

17:02.160 --> 17:05.200
Yeah. Like... Like the landing.
Yeah.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.800
So, about 70% of people... I can hear
that... Now I've said it again...

17:07.800 --> 17:10.000
You can hear it? Yeah, now you've
said it...

17:10.000 --> 17:11.720
And now it's like it's happening,

17:11.720 --> 17:14.640
because I'm looking at it and I feel
it like it's around me.

17:14.640 --> 17:17.280
About 70% of people who watch this
hear a thudding sound when...

17:17.280 --> 17:19.520
Oh, it's horrible cos it feels like
you're next to it.

17:19.520 --> 17:22.440
Yeah, it makes me queasy. But is it
only your eyes telling your brain

17:22.440 --> 17:25.040
something that would normally happen
because of the movement?

17:25.040 --> 17:27.200
It's completely silent.
And if you close your eyes,

17:27.200 --> 17:29.520
there's nothing there.
Yeah, it's totally silent.

17:29.520 --> 17:31.760
Right, let's nose around
another question.

17:31.760 --> 17:33.240
Hmm! Here's one.

17:33.240 --> 17:36.360
OK, what do banks smell of?

17:36.360 --> 17:37.840
Money.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.880
Money.

17:37.840 --> 17:39.880
KLAXON SOUNDS

17:42.840 --> 17:45.280
It depends on the bank,
is the truth of it.

17:45.280 --> 17:46.840
It depends on what scent

17:46.840 --> 17:50.120
they have decided to associate
the bank with. Bank scent. Yeah.

17:50.120 --> 17:52.320
Armpit. So it could be grapefruit,
could be cardamom,

17:52.320 --> 17:54.640
could be chocolate. I got driven here
today in a car

17:54.640 --> 17:57.800
by a driver who had an extraordinary
amount of aftershave on,

17:57.800 --> 17:59.960
and he was playing Smooth FM.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.600
Oh. Oh. Did you fall in love?
Honestly...

18:02.600 --> 18:04.640
..I was quite in love.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.640
LAUGHTER

18:06.880 --> 18:09.240
It is always funny to listen
to very emotional music

18:09.240 --> 18:10.720
with someone you've just met. Yes.

18:10.720 --> 18:12.560
Like, the late drive home
and it's like...

18:12.560 --> 18:14.800
# We weren't even married... #
You're like...

18:14.800 --> 18:16.840
LAUGHTER

18:16.840 --> 18:18.200
# On my own. #

18:19.440 --> 18:22.520
It's such a sad bit. Very intense!

18:22.520 --> 18:25.200
You both are in your own world of
failed relationships. Yeah!

18:25.200 --> 18:27.360
It's like, "We'll go to the petrol
station,

18:27.360 --> 18:29.000
"get something to eat, shall we?"

18:32.160 --> 18:35.240
When my... When my son was 18,
he discovered aftershave.

18:35.240 --> 18:37.920
And, er, oh, dear God!

18:37.920 --> 18:40.920
He'd do the "psssh, psssh, psssh!"

18:40.920 --> 18:43.880
And the whole
house would smell of Lynx.

18:43.880 --> 18:46.680
I still get such a visceral, like,
sexy feeling

18:46.680 --> 18:48.440
around the smell of Lynx. Mm.

18:48.440 --> 18:50.800
Because for me,
it's like being at a disco,

18:50.800 --> 18:54.680
aged 16, like, Lynx was the smell
the people you wanted smelled of,

18:54.680 --> 18:57.600
like, you didn't want to smell
something that smelled like a...

18:57.600 --> 19:00.160
So he was using the right one at 18?
Yeah. Yeah, that's the...

19:00.160 --> 19:02.480
Oh. .."Wsssssh!"
Yeah, and then you're like...

19:02.480 --> 19:05.280
SHE YIPS

19:02.480 --> 19:05.280
Yeah.

19:05.280 --> 19:07.600
We're in the world of
scent marketing.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.120
So, environmental scenting.

19:09.120 --> 19:10.960
It's the scent that
is introduced

19:10.960 --> 19:12.640
into a retail or a leisure
environment.

19:12.640 --> 19:14.240
It's really big business.

19:14.240 --> 19:16.600
It makes you part
with your money? It does, darling.

19:16.600 --> 19:19.240
It works because it sends
signals to our limbic system,

19:19.240 --> 19:22.200
which is the sector of the brain
that controls memory and emotion

19:22.200 --> 19:25.000
and it absolutely works.
The very first bank to try this

19:25.000 --> 19:27.480
was the National Australia Bank
headquarters in Melbourne,

19:27.480 --> 19:30.000
and they introduced the scent
of lime and grapefruit...

19:30.000 --> 19:32.000
Oh! ..in 2012.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.200
They're quite happy scents. Yes.
Happy scents. Yeah.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.920
And some high-end banks or
sort of financial institutions

19:36.920 --> 19:39.040
use signature scents
that are supposed to lend

19:39.040 --> 19:42.200
a sense of luxury
to their clientele. Very nice.

19:42.200 --> 19:44.600
One bank selected a premium
fragrance

19:44.600 --> 19:48.280
that begins with
mouthwatering mandarin,

19:48.280 --> 19:49.800
fresh, watery ozone

19:49.800 --> 19:51.480
and green cardamom notes

19:51.480 --> 19:54.040
supported by black pepper and musk.

19:54.040 --> 19:57.560
Musk? Musk. That's lovely.
I don't want that in a bank.

19:57.560 --> 20:00.520
Do you want that in a bank?
I don't want musk in a bank, no.

20:00.520 --> 20:03.280
I don't want to get
pregnant off the air in a bank.

20:03.280 --> 20:05.080
LAUGHTER

20:05.080 --> 20:06.360
Well, casinos have found,

20:06.360 --> 20:08.720
depending on the scent that they use
in the casino,

20:08.720 --> 20:10.200
people will gamble more.

20:10.200 --> 20:14.520
Wow. So, the Las Vegas Hilton found
that people spent 50% more time

20:14.520 --> 20:16.720
playing in the casino
if there were floral smells.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.120
I like the idea of quite
a lot of rough gamblers going,

20:19.120 --> 20:20.520
"Ooh, it's nice in here." Ooh.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.760
I've been to Vegas casinos and
people smoke in there.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.320
There's still smoking?
Yeah, in the casino.

20:25.320 --> 20:26.840
I love a casino. I do.

20:26.840 --> 20:28.360
Do you? Oh, God.

20:28.360 --> 20:31.120
Oh, my God, Sandi.
That's the most random fact!

20:31.120 --> 20:33.280
I would never...
Toksvig loves a casino.

20:33.280 --> 20:35.960
She loves gambling.
She goes in the roulette wheel.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.480
Whoo-ooh-ooh!

20:39.480 --> 20:42.280
"I'm going for 14. Wish me luck!"

20:47.200 --> 20:49.160
"It's red, it's red, it's red!"

20:50.960 --> 20:52.960
That is so funny. Oh, God.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.160
So, Las Vegas,
they all have different smells.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.200
The Mirage is Polynesian,
the Mandalay Bay is Southeast Asian

20:58.200 --> 20:59.360
and the Bellagio -

20:59.360 --> 21:01.800
whispers of northern Italy.
Oh! I know.

21:01.800 --> 21:05.000
And cigars and cigarette
smoke, mainly. Yeah.

21:05.000 --> 21:06.400
So, scent marketing is a thing.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.600
Jewellers, gyms, dentists, funeral
parlours,

21:08.600 --> 21:10.000
all kinds of people use it now.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.600
It's very popular in supermarkets,
scent marketing.

21:12.600 --> 21:15.240
So, in New York, for example,
they have fresh bread

21:15.240 --> 21:18.640
in the bread aisle, grapefruit in the
fruit aisle, that kind of thing.

21:18.640 --> 21:21.200
But it's not the only trick
that supermarkets play.

21:21.200 --> 21:24.600
Some supermarkets use smaller
floor tiles

21:24.600 --> 21:27.080
in front of the more expensive
sections.

21:27.080 --> 21:30.760
And the reason is, as you notice
the clicking of your trolley wheels

21:30.760 --> 21:32.080
is becoming faster,

21:32.080 --> 21:34.760
you don't realise it's the tiles
becoming smaller,

21:34.760 --> 21:37.440
you instinctively slow down.
You feel like you've sped up

21:37.440 --> 21:39.800
cos you can hear the wheels
kind of going like this.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.760
You think it's going a bit too
fast. Are any choices our own?

21:43.760 --> 21:45.320
Absolutely nothing.

21:45.320 --> 21:47.720
When we spray Lynx and we spray
perfume, we're all, like,

21:47.720 --> 21:50.920
doing the sell. Yeah. It's just
like, who are we?

21:50.920 --> 21:55.360
There's an amazing documentary
called The Men Who Made Us Sell.

21:55.360 --> 21:59.480
It was Sigmund Freud's nephew,
I'm pretty sure, um,

21:59.480 --> 22:05.200
kind of made it over, in
post-World War Germany, to America

22:05.200 --> 22:09.480
and started using many
of the theories about people for,

22:09.480 --> 22:12.360
for selling reasons.
For marketing. For marketing.

22:12.360 --> 22:15.120
And one of the big things he did was
give...

22:15.120 --> 22:17.960
So, women's rights had started,
because people were like,

22:17.960 --> 22:19.400
"Oh, they should have some."

22:19.400 --> 22:21.240
"I'm still not on board yet, but
we'll see."

22:21.240 --> 22:23.640
And there were all
these women marching

22:23.640 --> 22:26.280
and they gave some of them
some cigarettes,

22:26.280 --> 22:31.080
so then the symbol of, like,
a sort of sexy, progressive woman,

22:31.080 --> 22:32.880
because they would sell them
for pictures

22:32.880 --> 22:35.000
and give them to women for free
in the marches,

22:35.000 --> 22:38.600
that became an iconic kind of image,
and they were like, what...

22:38.600 --> 22:40.880
And it's the penis, it's a phallus,
and stuff like that,

22:40.880 --> 22:42.120
and just, like...

22:42.120 --> 22:44.960
I was with you right up until that.
No, no, as in... But he...

22:44.960 --> 22:47.920
He would have the thing of going,
that whole thing of like...

22:47.920 --> 22:49.840
It's on fire, the penis.
It's on fire.

22:49.840 --> 22:51.520
If it's any consolation.

22:51.520 --> 22:54.800
No, but seriously, if you burn
the tip of a penis, honestly,

22:54.800 --> 22:58.040
that man will give you
whatever you want.

22:58.040 --> 23:02.360
The guy you're talking about is
Edward Bernays. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

23:02.360 --> 23:05.880
Right. Who is this man
and what do his farts smell like?

23:05.880 --> 23:08.480
Oh. Oh. Wow. This show's really gone
downhill, I feel!

23:08.480 --> 23:11.400
# I hear music...#
Yes.

23:11.400 --> 23:13.040
I really like that song.

23:13.040 --> 23:16.240
He looks like his farts smell of,

23:16.240 --> 23:18.040
like, a church.

23:18.040 --> 23:23.360
Oh. What does a church smell of
to you? Incense and...

23:23.360 --> 23:25.360
..crime. Yeah!

23:29.000 --> 23:31.240
It's a heady combination.

23:32.320 --> 23:34.880
Rolling tobacco, I imagine he smells
like.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.000
His farts smell of chocolate.
Do they?

23:37.000 --> 23:39.080
And look how proud he is of it.
I know.

23:39.080 --> 23:42.400
So he's a French inventor called
Christian Poincheval

23:42.400 --> 23:45.520
and in 2017, he invented a pill,
which he is showing there,

23:45.520 --> 23:48.360
which he claims makes farts
smell of chocolate.

23:48.360 --> 23:52.320
He told a journalist he had been
eating in a restaurant with friends

23:52.320 --> 23:56.760
and he said, "Our farts were
so smelly, we nearly suffocated.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.600
"People at the table next to us were
not happy.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.040
Something had to be done.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.520
Oh. It's nice to hear of a French
person that isn't sexy, isn't it?

24:07.120 --> 24:08.840
Just give one to every taxi driver.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.240
"It's a long journey.
Just have one of those."

24:13.120 --> 24:14.520
He made other fart fragrances.

24:14.520 --> 24:17.080
You can also have roses and violets.
Most reviewers said

24:17.080 --> 24:19.800
that they either made their farts
stop smelling entirely

24:19.800 --> 24:21.720
or stopped
them from farting together,

24:21.720 --> 24:24.280
and that's because the pills
contain active charcoal,

24:24.280 --> 24:26.760
basically charcoal with lots of
pockets of air in it,

24:26.760 --> 24:29.440
and that is known to remove smelly
or impure substances.

24:29.440 --> 24:31.400
Is that what we should put
around the dog?

24:31.400 --> 24:34.520
Um... You need some sort of absorbent
dome around the dog.

24:34.520 --> 24:37.600
Well, you can
get fart-proof underwear.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.560
For dogs? Wow. Well, I don't
see any reason why a dog couldn't

24:40.560 --> 24:44.960
have on a pair of underpants,
and there are fart-proof underwear.

24:44.960 --> 24:47.840
Is it just like a Covid
mask in the bottom of your pants?

24:47.840 --> 24:50.560
Yes, so there's a Colorado
psychologist called Buck Weimer

24:50.560 --> 24:53.080
and he invented anti-flatulence
underwear

24:53.080 --> 24:54.640
as a present for his wife.

24:54.640 --> 24:58.240
Oh. Oh. Oh-ho-ho-ho!

24:58.240 --> 25:00.680
Who says romance is dead, eh?

25:00.680 --> 25:01.720
His ex-wife.

25:01.720 --> 25:04.880
But I don't see why you couldn't get
them for the dog, darling.

25:04.880 --> 25:07.200
I think the dog might feel shamed.
Mm.

25:07.200 --> 25:08.400
To be honest with you,

25:08.400 --> 25:10.960
I'm not looking to protect the dog's
feelings.

25:10.960 --> 25:14.280
Fart-proof underpants don't make
scents.

25:14.280 --> 25:18.400
Hey! Very good.

25:18.400 --> 25:21.960
Right, this question is not as
senseless as it sounds.

25:21.960 --> 25:24.480
What kind of dog can tell the time?

25:25.760 --> 25:28.760
# I hear music. #

25:28.760 --> 25:30.040
A good boy.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.400
A watchdog. Ay!

25:36.400 --> 25:37.800
KLAXON SOUNDS

25:37.800 --> 25:39.120
GROANING

25:40.800 --> 25:41.920
I asked for it.

25:41.920 --> 25:43.920
What about a CLOCKER spaniel?

25:43.920 --> 25:44.960
KLAXON SOUNDS

25:47.880 --> 25:50.680
There's no original thought left.

25:50.680 --> 25:53.440
Who's got dogs? I've got a dog,
you've got a dog, you've got a dog.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.560
Well, have you ever noticed
that when you get home,

25:55.560 --> 25:57.480
your dog seems to be waiting for
you?

25:57.480 --> 25:59.440
How does the dog know what time
it is?

25:59.440 --> 26:02.080
It waits there all day, surely.
They're like...

26:02.080 --> 26:03.560
PANTING

26:02.080 --> 26:03.560
No, definitely not.

26:03.560 --> 26:06.160
No. Definitely, they don't do that.
My dog, she would get up

26:06.160 --> 26:09.080
and start yelling the place down
before the doorbell rang,

26:09.080 --> 26:11.520
so you could tell someone was
approaching the property.

26:11.520 --> 26:14.200
Sure, they can hear if somebody's
approaching the property,

26:14.200 --> 26:15.960
but how might they know what time
it is?

26:15.960 --> 26:19.160
Well, I'm probably going
to say this wrong, but there's...

26:19.160 --> 26:21.160
When they go to the toilet,

26:21.160 --> 26:25.760
they put their bum to the sun,
the south, always to the south.

26:25.760 --> 26:27.880
I got told this quite recently,
and it's...

26:27.880 --> 26:30.080
Maybe... it's QI, cut it if it's
wrong

26:30.080 --> 26:33.000
but I think... I think it....

26:33.000 --> 26:36.280
You want a show called Gullible.

26:36.280 --> 26:39.000
The more I'm talking on it, the more
I'm losing faith in it.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.280
Well, there is some thought

26:40.280 --> 26:42.840
that they do prefer to poo along the
north-south axis,

26:42.840 --> 26:45.200
and it's to do
with magnetic fields, but...

26:45.200 --> 26:47.960
Ooh! There we are. ..we don't know
if that's true or not.

26:47.960 --> 26:50.160
So, it might be your smell,
is the thing.

26:50.160 --> 26:52.400
Right. So it is not that you stink.

26:52.400 --> 26:53.880
My smell? No, a human being's
smell.

26:53.880 --> 26:56.600
It's not your smell as you come up
the path, or whatever.

26:56.600 --> 26:58.920
After you leave the house,
your scent lingers

26:58.920 --> 27:01.120
and they have phenomenal sense
of smell,

27:01.120 --> 27:02.760
and it decays slowly over the day.

27:02.760 --> 27:05.000
If you have a fairly regular
schedule,

27:05.000 --> 27:08.200
the dog will notice when your smell
has declined to a certain level

27:08.200 --> 27:10.760
that it associates with you coming
home. Wow! Wow!

27:10.760 --> 27:13.720
And then, if it disappears
completely, it thinks you're dead.

27:13.720 --> 27:15.280
And then, when you open the door,

27:15.280 --> 27:17.840
it acts as if you've come back from
the dead,

27:17.840 --> 27:20.600
every time you come home. "Oh, my
God! I thought you were dead!

27:20.600 --> 27:22.680
"You were definitely dead!

27:22.680 --> 27:25.520
"It's a miracle!"

27:25.520 --> 27:28.000
There's a dog researcher called
Alexandre Horowitz,

27:28.000 --> 27:30.400
and what she did was, she tested
this thing about the smell

27:30.400 --> 27:33.160
by placing several fairly
sweaty shirts from the dog's owner

27:33.160 --> 27:36.400
around the house before the dog's
owner was due to come back.

27:36.400 --> 27:38.000
And the dog was not waiting
by the door

27:38.000 --> 27:39.960
because the smell
was still strong in the house,

27:39.960 --> 27:41.240
and therefore it didn't think

27:41.240 --> 27:43.280
it must be time for the owner
to be returning.

27:43.280 --> 27:46.400
I mean, it could also be if you feed
your dog at exactly the same time,

27:46.400 --> 27:48.520
or your cats, then they know
it's nearly dinner time

27:48.520 --> 27:50.280
because they're beginning
to get hungry.

27:50.280 --> 27:53.920
If you have a dog, is a dog pleased
to see your face when you come home?

27:53.920 --> 27:56.000
Yes, my dog really is.

27:56.000 --> 27:57.880
My dog levitates when I return.

27:57.880 --> 27:59.840
It is frightening. Aw!

27:59.840 --> 28:02.080
But it seems that the dogs

28:02.080 --> 28:03.760
don't really have a part
of the brain

28:03.760 --> 28:06.280
that specifically
responds to faces. Wow.

28:06.280 --> 28:09.040
So, they did a study in Hungary
of domesticated dogs,

28:09.040 --> 28:10.480
and they showed them videos

28:10.480 --> 28:13.720
of either the back or the front
of a human head.

28:13.720 --> 28:16.280
And first of all, they preferred dog
videos to human videos.

28:16.280 --> 28:17.720
Secondly, they didn't seem to care

28:17.720 --> 28:19.760
if it was the back
of the front of your head. Wow.

28:19.760 --> 28:22.040
What part of a human does
a dog recognise, then?

28:22.040 --> 28:23.680
What part of you is it?

28:23.680 --> 28:26.080
The smell. Well, I have to say this
is one of the few times

28:26.080 --> 28:29.160
where I would dispute something
because I swear that my dog

28:29.160 --> 28:30.640
can recognise emotion in my face.

28:30.640 --> 28:32.680
But do you think that's
actually your face

28:32.680 --> 28:35.640
or that dogs can sense feelings more
than it's your...

28:35.640 --> 28:37.760
they know Sandi's feelings and ups
and downs,

28:37.760 --> 28:39.680
and it's not your...?
It may well be that.

28:39.680 --> 28:42.360
I mean, they certainly can read your
emotions, I think.

28:42.360 --> 28:44.640
Sometimes I get
all three children and the dog,

28:44.640 --> 28:46.320
all have left the room.

28:47.520 --> 28:49.400
"He's going off. Let's go out."

28:52.200 --> 28:54.320
They're all in
another room like that together.

28:54.320 --> 28:55.880
"Have you calmed down?"

28:59.080 --> 29:01.320
"Sorry, everyone, sorry."

29:01.320 --> 29:05.720
You know there's dogs who can now
smell tumours or cancer in people.

29:05.720 --> 29:08.480
But you don't want that in your dog!
You come in and the dog was,

29:08.480 --> 29:12.080
"Wow, OK... No, I'm not going to tell
you. I'm not telling you."

29:12.080 --> 29:13.360
"Er, do you want to know?"

29:13.360 --> 29:16.480
"I'm not qualified, actually, to
give the information."

29:16.480 --> 29:20.640
"No, we can absolutely throw the
ball. Enjoy life while I can."

29:20.640 --> 29:24.960
I mean... Yeah, "Let's just
enjoy today, shall we?"

29:26.960 --> 29:31.040
Now it's time for our final
sensory demonstration.

29:31.040 --> 29:33.400
OK, so have a look at this.

29:33.400 --> 29:34.880
Whoa.

29:34.880 --> 29:39.680
It looks like a flat window with
one end shorter than the other.

29:39.680 --> 29:43.440
I'm just going to make sure that you
guys can see this, like this.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.760
It's called the Ames window.

29:45.760 --> 29:47.760
I'm too short to do this sitting
down.

29:47.760 --> 29:52.360
So I'm going to spin it and just
look at the effect that it has...

29:52.360 --> 29:54.080
Oh, I don't like...
..when it's spinning.

29:54.080 --> 29:56.160
Isn't it interesting?
It appears to stop halfway.

29:56.160 --> 29:58.520
It doesn't look like it's
spinning all the way around.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.720
Yeah, that's the thing. Oh!
That is really weird. Oh!

30:00.720 --> 30:02.240
I thought you weren't doing it
then.

30:02.240 --> 30:04.120
If you look at the thing,
it's not spinning.

30:04.120 --> 30:05.800
I thought you were getting ready to
do it.

30:05.800 --> 30:07.360
No, I'm spinning it all the way
round,

30:07.360 --> 30:09.760
but it appears to stop halfway
and go back the other way. Oh!

30:09.760 --> 30:11.680
Ohh! Oh! Oh!

30:11.680 --> 30:13.000
My gosh!

30:13.000 --> 30:15.440
Have a look at this.
Put a pencil through the window.

30:15.440 --> 30:17.800
You can stick things on
or through the window

30:17.800 --> 30:21.280
and then the objects appear to lift
out of the window.

30:21.280 --> 30:23.600
No way! What...

30:23.600 --> 30:26.120
..the absolute...? Please.

30:26.120 --> 30:29.160
Isn't it weird? Oh, it's so weird.
I know.

30:29.160 --> 30:32.240
So it's called the Ames window.
It was invented by an American artist

30:32.240 --> 30:35.120
and psychologist called Adelbert Ames
and what it is

30:35.120 --> 30:37.360
is that the
brain knows what a window looks like.

30:37.360 --> 30:38.760
We know what a window looks like.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.920
It has equal sides.

30:39.920 --> 30:41.520
And they've done this experiment

30:41.520 --> 30:44.280
with people who are not used to
Western architecture

30:44.280 --> 30:46.800
and all they see
is an irregular shape spinning.

30:46.800 --> 30:48.880
We're seeing what
we see as a window?

30:48.880 --> 30:51.600
Yeah. It's the same - if you look at
these two lines,

30:51.600 --> 30:54.000
have a
look and tell me which one is longer.

30:54.000 --> 30:56.200
Oh, the top one looks longer.

30:56.200 --> 30:58.160
You'd think the top one,
but I'm sure that's...

30:58.160 --> 31:00.080
The top one looks longer.
But they're the same.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.680
They're exactly the same length.

31:01.680 --> 31:04.120
And it's only in the West that we
see that the top looks longer

31:04.120 --> 31:06.520
and if you test it on indigenous
people in parts of Angola

31:06.520 --> 31:09.600
and the Ivory Coast and so on, they
don't see a difference in the length.

31:09.600 --> 31:11.920
There's an amazing book by a
chap called Will Storr

31:11.920 --> 31:13.720
called The Science Of Storytelling

31:13.720 --> 31:15.960
and it's all about our perception
of stuff like that

31:15.960 --> 31:17.400
and how the first thing you'll
see

31:17.400 --> 31:20.280
will be the most dangerous
version of the thing it could be,

31:20.280 --> 31:23.000
hence why sometimes if you see a
shadow at the side of the road

31:23.000 --> 31:26.000
that looks like a creepy man leaning
into the road and then,

31:26.000 --> 31:27.920
you get closer and realise it's a
gatepost,

31:27.920 --> 31:29.640
you see the creepy man to protect
you

31:29.640 --> 31:31.480
in case it is the worst possible
thing

31:31.480 --> 31:33.080
you have ever imagined before,

31:33.080 --> 31:35.600
but only based on the things
you've already ever imagined.

31:35.600 --> 31:38.160
It's very like the auditory
illusion we heard earlier,

31:38.160 --> 31:40.960
it depends what language, what
cultural context you've come from,

31:40.960 --> 31:43.520
what you'll hear, whether you hear
whether the note has gone up

31:43.520 --> 31:45.600
or down, whether you think
it's shorter or longer.

31:45.600 --> 31:48.240
And if you look on the graph, you can
see this is exactly the same.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.040
My brain's still struggling to
accept it. I'm counting the squares.

31:51.040 --> 31:54.520
It's fascinating, isn't it?
Right, cue lighting.

31:54.520 --> 31:55.680
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

31:55.680 --> 31:58.360
Ooh! Oh. Ooh.

31:58.360 --> 32:01.600
What does the spotlight
effect feel like?

32:01.600 --> 32:04.320
It points out creeps in our
presence.

32:04.320 --> 32:05.360
LAUGHTER

32:07.040 --> 32:09.640
That's not nice. What does that feel
like? Well, it seems to be

32:09.640 --> 32:11.800
the right answer, because they
brought them back.

32:11.800 --> 32:14.480
What does it feel like to...?
I love it. You love it.

32:14.480 --> 32:18.160
It reminds me being on stage,
the only one in the room lit,

32:18.160 --> 32:20.760
the only one anyone can hear.
Go on, Alan. Dreamland.

32:20.760 --> 32:23.400
Yes, yes, Alan, yes.

32:23.400 --> 32:26.360
Darling, it's something that maybe
you guys

32:26.360 --> 32:29.320
are not the right people to test this
on. Yeah. A bad focus group.

32:29.320 --> 32:31.320
I imagine it's supposed to make you
feel

32:31.320 --> 32:33.520
a bit uncomfortable and
self-conscious.

32:33.520 --> 32:36.520
The spotlight effect is the name
psychologists have given

32:36.520 --> 32:38.880
to our tendency to dramatically
overestimate

32:38.880 --> 32:41.120
how much attention
people are paying to us.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.560
I don't think so, Sandi.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.920
I don't think so.

32:49.920 --> 32:51.560
In 2000, students were asked

32:51.560 --> 32:55.960
to wear a bright yellow
Barry Manilow T-shirt to a seminar.

32:55.960 --> 32:59.120
In what year, sorry?
In the year 2000. OK.

33:01.160 --> 33:03.680
That's a really cruel experiment.
It is.

33:04.800 --> 33:08.160
He was described as a figure
of dubious renown.

33:08.160 --> 33:09.400
Ugh.

33:09.400 --> 33:10.960
That's on his passport.

33:10.960 --> 33:13.880
Among college students.
Oh, so they...? Yeah.

33:13.880 --> 33:16.680
Anyway, afterwards, the wearers
of this T-shirt were asked

33:16.680 --> 33:19.240
to estimate how many fellow students
had noticed

33:19.240 --> 33:21.320
that they were wearing this T-shirt,

33:21.320 --> 33:23.240
and they overestimated by a factor of
two.

33:23.240 --> 33:26.240
So it's the spotlight effect. You
think that people are looking at you

33:26.240 --> 33:27.800
when, in fact, they're not really.

33:27.800 --> 33:31.400
Well, maybe it means if you feel
vulnerable that you can be seen,

33:31.400 --> 33:34.280
you're more vulnerable
to a predator. Hmm.

33:34.280 --> 33:37.840
You know, if you're in a herd
of antelope or something,

33:37.840 --> 33:40.560
you're like, "Oh, I'm the only
one they can see." Yes!

33:40.560 --> 33:42.800
Because you're wearing
a Barry Manilow T-shirt.

33:42.800 --> 33:45.520
But of course, the cheetah
in the long grass

33:45.520 --> 33:48.600
doesn't know
anything about Barry Manilow.

33:48.600 --> 33:51.840
It's just trying to find
the slowest, weakest one.

33:51.840 --> 33:54.240
I mean, I'm really trying to make
the science that I've got

33:54.240 --> 33:56.600
match up with what you just said.

33:56.600 --> 34:00.000
Does the spotlight effect always
make us think it's something great

34:00.000 --> 34:01.640
rather than it's something bad?

34:01.640 --> 34:04.440
No, it's just, for example,
if you contribute in an argument

34:04.440 --> 34:07.120
in a group discussion, people almost
always overestimate

34:07.120 --> 34:10.640
the extent to which others have noted
their contributions. Hmm.

34:10.640 --> 34:13.040
And now I have a horrible
sense of foreboding

34:13.040 --> 34:15.560
that it's about to be General
Ignorance. Yes, it is.

34:15.560 --> 34:17.400
Fingers on buzzers, please.

34:17.400 --> 34:21.680
Which composer was completely deaf
by the time of their final work?

34:21.680 --> 34:23.240
MUSIC: U Can't Touch This
by MC Hammer

34:23.240 --> 34:24.320
Beethoven.

34:24.320 --> 34:26.000
KLAXON SOUNDS

34:26.000 --> 34:27.040
Oh, God.

34:29.120 --> 34:31.320
Beethoven is the one that we most
think.

34:31.320 --> 34:34.080
He was always thought to have been
deaf at the end of his life.

34:34.080 --> 34:36.240
It is popularly believed
that he wrote

34:36.240 --> 34:38.560
the ninth and final symphony, 1824,

34:38.560 --> 34:40.520
and that he couldn't really hear it.

34:40.520 --> 34:43.560
Now, we know his hearing did
deteriorate, but there is some...

34:43.560 --> 34:47.480
I love that there is still research
happening and all these years later,

34:47.480 --> 34:50.560
we might decide to change
our minds about it.

34:50.560 --> 34:53.120
He carried around something
called conversation books

34:53.120 --> 34:56.040
when his hearing deteriorated,
in which his companions

34:56.040 --> 34:58.040
could scribble their side
of the conversation.

34:58.040 --> 35:01.000
He also used them as sort of diary,
writing reminders, shopping lists

35:01.000 --> 35:02.720
like any other human being.

35:02.720 --> 35:06.920
And there's a musicologist
at the Kent State University in Ohio

35:06.920 --> 35:10.160
called Theodore Albrecht, and he
has spent decades translating

35:10.160 --> 35:13.600
these conversation books
into English and found 23 references

35:13.600 --> 35:16.720
to Beethoven's hearing in the
composer's writing around this time.

35:16.720 --> 35:19.640
So, for example, in 1823, Beethoven
wrote,

35:19.640 --> 35:22.480
"Baths and country air
could improve many things.

35:22.480 --> 35:26.120
"Just do not use mechanical devices,
ear trumpets too early.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.920
"By abstaining from using them,

35:27.920 --> 35:31.440
"I have fairly preserved my left ear
this way."

35:31.440 --> 35:35.000
And that is only a year before the
Ninth Symphony.

35:35.000 --> 35:37.760
So it's possible
that we just were wrong.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.840
Not only, according to Professor
Albrecht,

35:39.840 --> 35:43.160
was Beethoven not completely deaf at
the premiere of his Ninth Symphony,

35:43.160 --> 35:45.120
he could hear, although increasingly
faintly,

35:45.120 --> 35:47.360
for at least two years afterwards.

35:47.360 --> 35:50.600
I love that we're
like, "You weren't that good.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.480
"You were only barely deaf."

35:54.640 --> 35:57.400
You had the left ear, Beethoven,
you had your left one.

35:57.400 --> 35:59.480
That's the most Irish
you'll ever be.

35:59.480 --> 36:02.000
"Ah, but I heard he wasn't
that deaf, like." Yeah.

36:02.000 --> 36:04.240
Gabriel Faure,
we could have gone for,

36:04.240 --> 36:05.880
or Ralph Vaughan Williams.

36:05.880 --> 36:09.800
Sadly, a deafness caused by the guns
of World War I. Sorry?

36:09.800 --> 36:14.320
I totally fell for it. Did you like
that? Yeah, I remember it.

36:14.320 --> 36:15.880
It's like having my dad here.

36:15.880 --> 36:19.840
Beethoven could probably hear
the cheers for his final symphony.

36:19.840 --> 36:23.800
What did people in the Middle Ages
do with their excrement?

36:23.800 --> 36:26.760
# Trees of green. #

36:26.760 --> 36:28.720
Look for magical stones in it.

36:28.720 --> 36:30.200
Yes. Bezoars.

36:30.200 --> 36:33.160
But then, throw
it out of the window.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.200
KLAXON SOUNDS

36:36.000 --> 36:37.560
No? Not throw it out of the window?

36:37.560 --> 36:40.120
But there's a picture of someone
throwing it out of the window.

36:40.120 --> 36:44.760
Well, this is actually an anecdote
about King Louis IX of France.

36:44.760 --> 36:48.720
And a student poured
his pot, as it were,

36:48.720 --> 36:50.320
out onto the king.

36:50.320 --> 36:52.640
And you would have thought the king
would be furious.

36:52.640 --> 36:54.600
But the king, in fact, gave him
a prebendary,

36:54.600 --> 36:57.280
which is a remunerative post in a
cathedral,

36:57.280 --> 36:59.680
because he was so thrilled
to see a young person up early

36:59.680 --> 37:01.760
and going about their studies.

37:01.760 --> 37:04.600
So you were not supposed
to throw your excrement

37:04.600 --> 37:06.760
out of the window.
Apart from anything else,

37:06.760 --> 37:09.480
everybody knew that human waste
spread disease.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.560
So they did not
tip it into the street,

37:11.560 --> 37:14.200
they poured it into the nearest
river. And the rules were,

37:14.200 --> 37:16.840
people were responsible for the
cleanliness of the streets

37:16.840 --> 37:18.040
outside their own houses.

37:18.040 --> 37:21.000
In the 1300s, there was one
man who was beaten to death

37:21.000 --> 37:23.440
for dropping eel skins on the street,
and the other people

37:23.440 --> 37:26.880
didn't want to have to pay the fine.
And larger houses had latrines.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.200
And then they had something called
a gong farmer,

37:29.200 --> 37:31.560
somebody who came and emptied the
latrine. There we are.

37:31.560 --> 37:33.200
They're taking it off.

37:33.200 --> 37:35.120
And towns usually provided
public latrines.

37:35.120 --> 37:36.880
They were known as places
of easement.

37:36.880 --> 37:38.280
Place of easement.

37:38.280 --> 37:41.280
Those two lads. Yeah.
Like, I'm doing a QI,

37:41.280 --> 37:43.720
which is a beloved
television show,

37:43.720 --> 37:47.400
and I have not even dressed up as
well as those two lads

37:47.400 --> 37:49.120
going to empty the jacks.

37:49.120 --> 37:51.360
That is bowler hats, waistcoat.
Whole shebang.

37:51.360 --> 37:53.920
You're probably going to get
shit on you. Absolutely.

37:53.920 --> 37:56.240
Gong farmers. Hats
off to the gong farmers.

37:56.240 --> 37:57.680
If you found something in the shit,

37:57.680 --> 38:00.160
somebody had dropped coins or
whatever, you got to keep it.

38:00.160 --> 38:01.400
Yes! Lovely. That's nice.

38:01.400 --> 38:03.520
I thought you were going to say they
did, like,

38:03.520 --> 38:05.080
tea readings with poo.

38:06.760 --> 38:09.520
Some sort of like, "Ooh!" You know.

38:09.520 --> 38:11.520
Where does the word "loo" come from?

38:11.520 --> 38:13.880
Er, short for Lulu?

38:15.440 --> 38:19.000
I mean... technically, that is
correct.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.200
It is short for Lulu.

38:21.200 --> 38:22.560
Short for lavatory.

38:22.560 --> 38:26.520
No. So, the story used to be that
"loo" came from the phrase

38:26.520 --> 38:28.920
"garde a l'eau" - meaning
"watch out for the water" -

38:28.920 --> 38:31.760
that people would shout as they
emptied their chamber pot

38:31.760 --> 38:32.960
into the street below.

38:32.960 --> 38:36.080
Cannot be the case because, first of
all, they didn't do that.

38:36.080 --> 38:39.080
Didn't do it. And secondly, the
first recorded use of the word "loo"

38:39.080 --> 38:41.920
comes from 1922 in James Joyce's
Ulysses.

38:41.920 --> 38:46.200
It's probably from Waterloo, which
was a company that made iron cisterns

38:46.200 --> 38:47.600
in the 20th century.

38:47.600 --> 38:49.840
Ahh. Wow.

38:49.840 --> 38:52.760
The notion that people emptied their
chamber pots out of the windows,

38:52.760 --> 38:53.920
a load of, erm...

38:53.920 --> 38:55.560
Anyway, moving on.

38:55.560 --> 38:57.520
Where does the ukulele come from?

38:57.520 --> 38:59.720
The ukulele case.

39:02.280 --> 39:04.520
It comes from, erm...

39:04.520 --> 39:06.360
..annoying people at house parties.

39:06.360 --> 39:08.760
Yes, these are all truisms.

39:08.760 --> 39:11.320
Colombia. Ireland.

39:11.320 --> 39:12.600
Ireland?

39:12.600 --> 39:14.480
No. We'd never do that to people.

39:14.480 --> 39:17.280
I like that you're going like this.
"Ireland..."

39:17.280 --> 39:19.400
"Ahh."
I was so impressed with myself

39:19.400 --> 39:21.200
and then I realised I was wrong,

39:21.200 --> 39:22.600
and I thought, "Just hold it..."

39:22.600 --> 39:24.960
LAUGHTER

39:24.960 --> 39:26.840
AISLING: Is it Honolulu?

39:26.840 --> 39:28.880
ROISIN: Ooh.
What state is that in?

39:28.880 --> 39:30.720
Ahh. I'm not going to tell you,
Sandi,

39:30.720 --> 39:33.280
because I don't want to patronise
you. Hawaii. Hawaii.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.560
KLAXON SOUNDS

39:37.360 --> 39:39.320
That's terrible.
It was invented in Madeira,

39:39.320 --> 39:41.200
which is a Portuguese island off the
coast.

39:41.200 --> 39:43.160
Oh, wow. That's not fair because
they set us up

39:43.160 --> 39:44.360
with a gentleman's shirt,

39:44.360 --> 39:45.920
the little hummingbird, the flower.

39:45.920 --> 39:48.240
That is because it is associated
with Hawaii.

39:48.240 --> 39:49.600
It was first brought to Hawaii

39:49.600 --> 39:53.960
by a migrant Portuguese worker named
Joao Fernandez in 1879.

39:53.960 --> 39:58.800
It's originally called braginho,
which is a Portuguese word for it.

39:58.800 --> 40:01.680
It was the Hawaiians who renamed it
ukulele,

40:01.680 --> 40:03.880
and it translates as "jumping flea"

40:03.880 --> 40:07.400
after the way the fingers kind of
leap about on the fingerboard.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.440
Right, at what time of day are
you most likely to hear

40:10.440 --> 40:12.640
a cock crowing? Oh.

40:12.640 --> 40:15.320
MUSIC: U Can't Touch This
by MC Hammer

40:15.320 --> 40:17.240
Soon as I bat my eyelashes.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.480
KLAXON SOUNDS

40:20.240 --> 40:21.760
How did they know?

40:23.480 --> 40:27.040
They are, people think, famous for
crowing at first light of day.

40:27.040 --> 40:30.440
Actually, they crow all bloody day,
sometimes at night as well.

40:30.440 --> 40:32.880
They do often crow at or just
before dawn,

40:32.880 --> 40:35.160
but basically, they then keep going.

40:35.160 --> 40:37.360
So, in the olden days... The olden
days.

40:37.360 --> 40:40.040
..which is exactly the type of
historical accuracy

40:40.040 --> 40:42.040
people are watching QI for...

40:44.240 --> 40:47.680
..when farmers were all reliant on
the cock crowing

40:47.680 --> 40:51.280
to know when to get up,
were they all just up all the time,

40:51.280 --> 40:55.200
just having the occasional hour-long
nap like newborn babies?

40:55.200 --> 40:57.400
Were they just getting dressed 18
times a day?

40:57.400 --> 40:59.920
The interesting thing is
that they seem to know it's dawn,

40:59.920 --> 41:01.000
not because it's light,

41:01.000 --> 41:04.240
but because their internal body clock
tells them. So they've done tests

41:04.240 --> 41:06.360
where they've kept them in sort of
dimly lit rooms,

41:06.360 --> 41:08.960
and they still start crowing
at exactly the same time each day,

41:08.960 --> 41:10.640
so you can rely on them to wake you.

41:10.640 --> 41:11.960
It's perfectly fine.

41:11.960 --> 41:15.040
It's one of the few creatures
that could swallow its own brain.

41:15.040 --> 41:16.200
What? What?

41:16.200 --> 41:18.840
Look at the size of its mouth.

41:18.840 --> 41:22.360
And its brain has got to get
into that tiny head.

41:22.360 --> 41:24.280
Oh, if you fed it its own brain?
If you got it out,

41:24.280 --> 41:25.560
it could eat its own brain.

41:25.560 --> 41:27.760
Anyway, they're not crowing
because it's light,

41:27.760 --> 41:29.680
they're crowing for all sorts of
reasons.

41:29.680 --> 41:32.080
Warnings, territorial
claims, showing dominance,

41:32.080 --> 41:34.320
tell other cocks
they've just mated. Woo!

41:34.320 --> 41:38.200
You know. Ah! Their crows
are really, really loud.

41:38.200 --> 41:41.040
It's an average of 100 decibels, if
you're standing within a few feet.

41:41.040 --> 41:42.880
That's about the same as a chainsaw.

41:42.880 --> 41:45.800
Or it could be as much as 143
decibels.

41:45.800 --> 41:49.560
So human eardrums rupture
at 150 decibels.

41:49.560 --> 41:53.000
So why don't cockerels
deafen themselves?

41:53.000 --> 41:55.480
Haven't got any ears.
No, that's not... Oh, actually,

41:55.480 --> 41:58.280
why would they be bothering telling
their mates about the...

41:58.280 --> 42:00.920
Why would they bother? Jess's head is
like Sherlock now.

42:00.920 --> 42:03.680
"But of course..." Yeah. This is
shrinking my brain to the point

42:03.680 --> 42:05.920
where I could eat it.

42:05.920 --> 42:07.160
They have an in-built system

42:07.160 --> 42:09.160
to prevent their hearing getting
damaged.

42:09.160 --> 42:11.120
It is amazing. Half of the
bird's eardrum

42:11.120 --> 42:15.000
is covered by bit of
soft tissue that dampens the noise.

42:15.000 --> 42:17.960
And also, when they tilt their head
back to crow,

42:17.960 --> 42:20.320
another bit of material covers
the ear canal completely

42:20.320 --> 42:22.760
and serves as a built-in ear
defender.

42:22.760 --> 42:25.520
Oh, so a little bit of minor
surgery and they'd shut up.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.560
Yeah.

42:29.240 --> 42:33.560
Well, the bit nobody talks about
is, why haven't the hens gone deaf?

42:33.560 --> 42:36.480
Oh. Oh, they're all in the
corner, like...

42:36.480 --> 42:38.080
"Shut it! Shut it!"

42:39.200 --> 42:41.520
If you hear a cock crow,
it might be morning

42:41.520 --> 42:43.280
or he might have just got lucky.

42:43.280 --> 42:46.040
Let's hear the scores and see
if they feel smelly or tasty.

42:46.040 --> 42:48.480
In last place, with a sense of
shame, frankly,

42:48.480 --> 42:50.400
with minus... Wow. Minus 36.

42:51.720 --> 42:54.320
Aisling. No! What? How?

42:54.320 --> 42:56.840
APPLAUSE

42:54.320 --> 42:56.840
I smell a rat. I smell a rat.

42:58.880 --> 43:02.480
With a sense of humour, in joint
second place with minus 18,

43:02.480 --> 43:04.400
it's Roisin and Jessica.

43:04.400 --> 43:05.440
APPLAUSE

43:08.440 --> 43:14.000
And with a sense of purpose,
with minus seven, it's Alan.

43:14.000 --> 43:15.040
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

43:21.920 --> 43:24.560
Thanks, Roisin, Aisling,
Jessica and Alan.

43:24.560 --> 43:26.720
I leave you with this sign-off from
Steve Martin

43:26.720 --> 43:28.640
about his sense of smell.

43:28.640 --> 43:30.720
"I cannot smell mothballs

43:30.720 --> 43:34.360
"because it's so difficult to
get their little legs apart."

43:34.360 --> 43:35.400
Goodnight.
