WEBVTT

00:03.878 --> 00:05.995
I'm so hungry I can't
even think.

00:06.163 --> 00:08.391
Hello?

00:08.511 --> 00:11.334
Peter? Hey, it's Lane.
Oh, hey, Lane.

00:11.502 --> 00:13.753
I didn't recognize the number.
I'm calling from a burner.

00:13.888 --> 00:15.922
How are you?
I'm good. How are you?

00:16.056 --> 00:17.974
I'm gonna be honest with you,
Peter-- lately I've been having

00:18.092 --> 00:19.809
a hard time.
Uh...

00:19.927 --> 00:21.678
It's like the things I used
to enjoy, I don't even enjoy

00:21.846 --> 00:23.763
anymore.
Hey, Pete, I've got...

00:23.898 --> 00:25.765
I'm... sorry.
My friend Tina last night

00:25.900 --> 00:27.767
brought over a bunch of locally
sourced farm-to-table cocaine,

00:27.902 --> 00:28.645
and I couldn't even find the
will to do a line.

00:28.714 --> 00:30.581
Okay. Sorry.
I've been having a hard time

00:30.716 --> 00:32.476
maintaining an erection at art
shows, which has never been a

00:32.718 --> 00:34.635
problem for me.
My friend Tina won't even invite

00:34.753 --> 00:36.637
me to his cuddle parties
anymore.

00:36.755 --> 00:38.639
Whatever, he's pretentious,
but still, it just feels bad.

00:38.757 --> 00:41.392
My hausfrau quit, so now how am
I gonna find someone to clean my

00:41.510 --> 00:44.095
house in the traditional
Bavarian fashion?

00:44.229 --> 00:47.315
I haven't touched my didgeridoo
in, like, three and a half...

00:47.432 --> 00:49.684
Are you chewing?
No, no, I'm listening.

00:49.851 --> 00:51.686
Peter, are you eating lunch
right now?

00:51.853 --> 00:54.021
I'm disrobing my soul, and
you're masticating?

00:54.189 --> 00:56.607
I'm sorry.
Lunch came and I just wanted to

00:56.742 --> 00:58.903
eat it before it got cold.
Well, is it, like, a grilled

00:58.910 --> 01:02.580
cheese or shawarma or something?
Turkey wrap.

01:02.698 --> 01:05.282
A hot turkey wrap?
No.

01:05.417 --> 01:07.835
Damn it, Peter.
I'm sorry!

01:07.953 --> 01:10.171
How sorry can you be through
a mouthful of Ruffles?

01:10.288 --> 01:12.423
No, no, no, I'm hungry sorry.
Now I'm asking you

01:12.541 --> 01:14.425
point-blank, please stop eating
chips.

01:14.543 --> 01:17.378
Ah, Peter!

01:17.751 --> 01:23.109
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync & corrections by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:23.229 --> 01:25.314
A turkey wrap?
It was sitting right in front

01:25.448 --> 01:27.316
of me; I was hungry.
I had my lunch boner.

01:27.450 --> 01:29.117
- You can't just put that away.
- You were in your

01:29.235 --> 01:31.476
appetite vinegar strokes.
Oh, God, oh, God, I got to eat!

01:34.123 --> 01:35.991
Why do you smell like cat food?

01:36.125 --> 01:38.085
I can explain.
I am actually bathing with a

01:38.244 --> 01:40.462
cat-food-scented soap.
Why?

01:40.580 --> 01:42.581
Because Milady's been very
aggressive with me.

01:42.749 --> 01:45.133
She's, like, always attacking me
and fighting with me.

01:45.251 --> 01:46.969
It's like Percy Harvin and the
Seahawks.

01:47.086 --> 01:48.587
Well, then trade her to the
Jets.

01:48.755 --> 01:50.675
We're not gonna trade anyone
anywhere, all right?

01:50.757 --> 01:52.641
I care about this relationship.
As a matter of fact, we're going

01:52.759 --> 01:54.977
to therapy this week.
Oh, sweet baby Jesus, this

01:55.094 --> 01:57.295
is a new low for this league.
You know what is not a low

01:57.313 --> 01:59.848
for this league?
Two tickets, Bears-Packers.

01:59.983 --> 02:02.601
Lambeau Field.
Whoa.

02:02.769 --> 02:04.603
Who are you taking?
I mean, I could take you,

02:04.771 --> 02:06.655
Pete, or I could take you,
Kevin, or I could take you,

02:06.773 --> 02:08.657
Andre.
Been willing to bring out my

02:08.775 --> 02:10.943
portable crepe machine for a
little tailgate.

02:11.110 --> 02:13.028
Or I could take my wife,
Sofia, who knows nothing about

02:13.162 --> 02:15.364
football, thinks the team name
is the Pack Rats.

02:15.498 --> 02:17.749
It really depends on who steps
up.

02:17.867 --> 02:20.118
Daddy needs a fresh drink.
Drink for the man, please.

02:20.286 --> 02:22.366
- Can I get a drink over here?
- Hey! How long am I

02:22.455 --> 02:24.289
gonna have to wait at the movie
theater before you guys decide

02:24.457 --> 02:26.291
to show up?
The movie doesn't start for

02:26.459 --> 02:28.176
an hour.
What are you talking about?

02:28.294 --> 02:29.962
It's 9:30.
No, it's not. It's 8:30.

02:30.129 --> 02:31.964
What?
No, you forgot about daylight

02:32.131 --> 02:33.682
savings time.
What the hell's that?

02:33.800 --> 02:35.401
You know, fall backwards,
spring forward?

02:35.468 --> 02:36.988
I don't know what you're
talking about.

02:37.136 --> 02:38.687
It's for the farmers.
The farmers?

02:38.805 --> 02:40.772
To help with their crops.
How?

02:40.890 --> 02:43.976
I think... it's in the
daylight and the way the Earth

02:44.143 --> 02:46.561
rotates during the winter.
Yeah, so they have more time.

02:46.696 --> 02:48.530
So who does this?
Everybody.

02:48.648 --> 02:50.365
Everybody in the country does
it, Taco.

02:50.483 --> 02:52.618
No, except for Arizona.
And Idaho, I think.

02:52.735 --> 02:55.037
You do it twice a year at
2:00 a.m. on the Saturday.

02:55.154 --> 02:57.239
Well, Sunday morning.
Not every Saturday.

02:57.373 --> 02:59.908
We all agree on one Saturday.
It's not Idaho. Indiana.

03:00.043 --> 03:02.377
Oh, you're right.
Guys, I love you and

03:02.495 --> 03:05.664
everything, but you all sound
super weird right now and kind

03:05.832 --> 03:08.500
of stupid.
Daylight savings time does

03:08.668 --> 03:11.803
sound stupider than Taco.
All right, boys, who's gonna

03:11.921 --> 03:15.891
take Daddy to the prom?
Oh, that sounded weirder than I

03:16.009 --> 03:17.893
wanted it to.
Hey!

03:18.011 --> 03:20.012
Lane?
Rodney!

03:20.179 --> 03:21.819
Everybody calls me Ruxin.
Good to see you,

03:21.848 --> 03:23.565
you little Jew.
So what's up, Lane?

03:23.683 --> 03:25.567
I've been battling some
pretty serious clinical

03:25.685 --> 03:28.186
depression, and, uh, Peter and I
had a little bit of a tiff.

03:28.354 --> 03:30.856
Well, Pete's a pickle.
Anyway...

03:31.024 --> 03:33.158
My mens-only feminist
collective is being sued.

03:33.276 --> 03:35.744
Why?
We had a male-only Take Back

03:35.862 --> 03:37.996
the Night rally.
Some women showed up.

03:38.114 --> 03:40.034
They wanted to participate.
We said, "You can't."

03:40.199 --> 03:42.079
They didn't go home.
We had to surround them and

03:42.201 --> 03:43.961
scream at them, and it got a
little physical.

03:44.087 --> 03:45.871
So you've got a good
relationship with women.

03:46.039 --> 03:47.873
Are you and your mom close?
Yeah, she's a bitch, but I

03:48.041 --> 03:49.541
need her.
Okay, well, this has been

03:49.709 --> 03:51.293
weird.
You seem like you're in the

03:51.427 --> 03:53.178
middle of a manic break.
 Now that I'm here,

03:53.296 --> 03:55.514
spending time with you, I just
want more of that sweet sauce.

03:55.631 --> 03:57.716
How about this weekend?
Sweat lodge?

03:57.884 --> 03:59.801
Oh, I can't this weekend.
I'm swamped with, uh,

03:59.936 --> 04:01.853
spreadsheets and...
What are these?

04:01.971 --> 04:03.889
Oh, those are tickets to the
Packers game this weekend.

04:04.057 --> 04:06.725
Oh, well, if you're gonna be
working, I'll take them.

04:06.893 --> 04:09.061
No, I... if I get all my work
done, then I'll probably take a

04:09.228 --> 04:11.446
client.
I have to take a client.

04:11.564 --> 04:13.281
I'll go with you guys.
What?

04:13.399 --> 04:15.317
I'll do Reiki on you and your
client. Have you, have you

04:15.451 --> 04:17.452
had Reiki before?
I got a hand job from a

04:17.570 --> 04:19.704
subservient Asian girl one time.
This is, uh, more of a barely

04:19.822 --> 04:21.990
sexual touching, and I'll do it
on you while you drive.

04:22.125 --> 04:24.543
Uh-huh.
Also, it's kismet, because

04:24.660 --> 04:27.295
I've been doing a photo essay
called "Twinks Love Bears,"

04:27.413 --> 04:30.165
where I go to Bears games, and I
find guys who look gay, and I

04:30.299 --> 04:33.251
take their photograph and then
I-I put it on my twink blog

04:33.419 --> 04:35.804
online.
As enticing as it is, the

04:35.922 --> 04:38.423
idea of me driving two hours
with your hands hovering over

04:38.591 --> 04:41.143
me, the energy of a manic
breakdown surrounding me, and

04:41.260 --> 04:45.013
then arriving at that game, and
you approaching men at a

04:45.148 --> 04:48.016
football game telling them you
think they're gay and taking

04:48.151 --> 04:51.603
their picture with me by your
side, I'm gonna have to pass.

04:51.771 --> 04:54.689
I just have too much work to do.
So I'm not gonna be able to go.

04:54.824 --> 04:58.493
I understand, Rodney.
Thank you for the tickets.

04:58.611 --> 05:00.862
I appreciate this.
What?

05:00.997 --> 05:03.999
I'm gonna touch your face.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.657
I can't believe you gave up
those Packers tickets.

05:07.792 --> 05:09.659
You think my first experience
at Lambeau Field was gonna be

05:09.794 --> 05:11.661
- with Lane?
- Ah, come on,

05:11.796 --> 05:13.580
Cleveland!
At least make it a game.

05:13.748 --> 05:15.999
A.J. Green just sitting on the
bench, getting all comfy.

05:16.133 --> 05:18.668
I need those points!
And I need you not to get

05:18.803 --> 05:21.137
those points, which is why I
love garbage time!

05:21.255 --> 05:23.757
You just got G.T.!
Garbage time!

05:23.925 --> 05:27.700
Garbage time is the worst.
Those are pathetic points.

05:27.820 --> 05:29.704
Okay, don't insult garbage time.

05:29.822 --> 05:31.956
That is the ethos upon which I
have built my life.

05:32.074 --> 05:34.075
It's like, look, you close a
deal at 10:30 a.m., rest of the

05:34.243 --> 05:36.244
day, garbage time.
Closing time at a bar.

05:36.412 --> 05:38.880
All the girls are drunk.
All the hot guys have gone home.

05:38.998 --> 05:41.499
So it's garbage time.
That's where I excel.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.751
You did.
You landed the drunk girl.

05:43.919 --> 05:45.920
Yeah, marriage is the
ultimate garbage time.

05:46.088 --> 05:47.968
You two are just running out the
clock together.

05:48.090 --> 05:50.058
That's right.
It's less about scoring at this

05:50.175 --> 05:51.676
stage than just, like, trying
not to get injured.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.594
We're taking the knee of
life, babe.

05:53.762 --> 05:55.847
Hey, what's up, guys?
Hi, Andre.

05:55.981 --> 05:58.266
Chilly, Andre?
Oh, I'm not...

05:58.434 --> 06:00.351
Whoa!
What?

06:00.486 --> 06:02.487
Oh, my God.
I got into a little accident

06:02.604 --> 06:04.522
at work with some scalpels.
Really?

06:04.656 --> 06:08.109
Or was it your cat, Milady?
Okay, it was Milady.

06:08.277 --> 06:12.113
But hear me out, okay?
Milady likes to relax at the end

06:12.281 --> 06:15.500
of the day and have a little
catnip, and I took it away from

06:15.617 --> 06:17.502
her too quickly.
It's my fault.

06:17.619 --> 06:19.539
I should've known.
I mean, I shouldn't have taken

06:19.621 --> 06:21.539
it away from her until she was
done.

06:21.673 --> 06:23.708
Andre, stop.
You are clearly in an abusive

06:23.842 --> 06:26.627
relationship-- with your cat,
but it's an abusive

06:26.795 --> 06:28.629
relationship, though.
I'm not in an abusive

06:28.797 --> 06:30.631
relationship.
We love each other, and we have

06:30.799 --> 06:32.717
a great relationship. It's fine.
Whoa.

06:32.851 --> 06:35.103
Why are you guys awake?
It's, like, 5:30 in the morning.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.271
What?
No, it's 9:30 at night.

06:37.389 --> 06:39.273
Not on Taco Standard Time,
it isn't.

06:39.391 --> 06:41.275
Taco Standard Time?
What?

06:41.393 --> 06:43.277
All this daylight savings
stuff is bullshit.

06:43.395 --> 06:45.446
No, no, no one should be telling
us what time it is.

06:45.564 --> 06:47.448
We should be deciding for
ourselves.

06:47.566 --> 06:49.450
I'm pro-choice when it comes
to time.

06:49.568 --> 06:51.035
That doesn't even make any
sense.

06:51.153 --> 06:53.314
So I have rolled back my
clock 14 hours and 39 minutes.

06:53.322 --> 06:55.790
That doesn't explain at all
why you are carrying a toolbox.

06:55.908 --> 06:58.576
When I can't sleep, I fix
things in your house.

06:58.710 --> 07:00.711
The drip in the shower,
the garbage disposal.

07:00.829 --> 07:02.830
How do you think things get
fixed around here?

07:02.998 --> 07:04.832
Bruce can't be here all the
time.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.834
Whoa, guys, Lane tried to
commit suicide.

07:07.002 --> 07:08.252
What?
Really?

07:08.387 --> 07:10.254
Oh, shit. Hope it wasn't my
turkey wrap.

07:10.389 --> 07:12.256
I just think it's kind of
selfish.

07:12.391 --> 07:14.392
Yeah, that's what they say
about suicide.

07:14.510 --> 07:16.677
It's very selfish.
No, it's selfish that he took

07:16.845 --> 07:20.314
my Packers tickets knowing he
was gonna commit suicide and

07:20.432 --> 07:22.517
that he wasn't gonna be able to
use them.

07:22.684 --> 07:24.402
That's the real issue here.
Exactly.

07:24.520 --> 07:27.905
That was selfish.
Lane!

07:28.023 --> 07:32.443
Rodney.
Everybody... calls me Ruxin.

07:32.578 --> 07:37.865
Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
Mm-hmm. It's good to see you.

07:38.033 --> 07:40.201
It's good to be touched.
The guys are wondering how

07:40.369 --> 07:42.870
you're doing, wondering how we
can make you better and

07:43.038 --> 07:45.339
wondering where those Packers
tickets are.

07:45.457 --> 07:48.292
I was in a pretty dark place,
and material possessions ceased

07:48.427 --> 07:50.711
to mean anything to me.
I donated all of my carob to an

07:50.879 --> 07:53.464
animal shelter.
So that dogs would know what

07:53.599 --> 07:55.967
chocolate doesn't taste like.
I gave my Victrola away to a

07:56.101 --> 07:58.262
deaf man as a last piece of
performance art, and then I

07:58.387 --> 08:00.638
prepared to self-slaughter.
I just got to think, before

08:00.772 --> 08:03.858
you do the deed, you're like, "I
should probably send those

08:03.976 --> 08:06.894
Packers tickets back to Ruxin,
because I'm not gonna use them."

08:07.062 --> 08:09.030
Tickets were the last thing
on my mind.

08:09.148 --> 08:11.482
You were in garbage time.
You garbage-timed me.

08:11.617 --> 08:13.201
I guess.
It's all in my note.

08:13.318 --> 08:15.036
Huh?
I sent you a suicide e-mail.

08:15.154 --> 08:17.788
Did you not get it?
Oh, you know what?

08:17.906 --> 08:20.458
Your e-mails go to a very
specific folder.

08:20.576 --> 08:24.962
Here it is.
Wow, this is... 13 pages long?

08:25.080 --> 08:26.831
Yeah.
That's the edited version.

08:26.965 --> 08:29.417
You'd think maybe you'd want
to focus-group it, show it to a

08:29.585 --> 08:31.905
few friends who have committed
suicide, see what worked for

08:31.920 --> 08:34.388
them, what didn't work...
Well, I see the issue with that.

08:34.506 --> 08:36.890
You know.
So... how's the patient?

08:37.009 --> 08:39.010
I see you have visitors today.
Yeah.

08:39.144 --> 08:41.846
I feel melancholic, Dr. Harvat.
Well, that's much better than

08:41.980 --> 08:44.732
when you were first in here.
Great. Well, we're all good.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.268
Just keep in mind where those
tickets went, okay, bud?

08:47.436 --> 08:48.936
Okay.
Well, read the note.

08:49.104 --> 08:52.190
Okay, visiting time is over.
I... I just have to ask: if

08:52.324 --> 08:54.325
you knew you weren't gonna use
the tickets, why would you take

08:54.443 --> 08:56.027
them?
Why would God take my sense

08:56.161 --> 08:57.778
of hope?
The answer to both questions is

08:57.946 --> 08:59.080
in the note.
This is the most

08:59.198 --> 09:00.781
inconsiderate suicide attempt
I've ever seen.

09:00.949 --> 09:03.900
If this is gonna escalate,
let's make it physical.

09:11.671 --> 09:15.257
Wait, what time does your

09:15.374 --> 09:18.293
phone say?
Mmm...

09:18.427 --> 09:21.179
10:04.
Oh, my God!

09:21.297 --> 09:22.977
I was supposed to be in court at
9:00 a.m.!

09:23.049 --> 09:27.269
Why does my clock say 7:43?

09:27.386 --> 09:30.138
Oh, God, Lipscombe's gonna kill
me.

09:30.273 --> 09:32.974
No, no, no, no, no!
What are you doing?!

09:33.109 --> 09:34.643
Yeah!
What is this?

09:34.777 --> 09:36.645
Ah, don't worry about it.
I already changed all the clocks

09:36.779 --> 09:39.281
in your house to the correct
time: 14 hours and 39 minutes

09:39.398 --> 09:40.949
back.
I know, you idiot.

09:41.067 --> 09:43.785
I'm talking about the existing
clock fire in my driveway.

09:43.903 --> 09:46.154
Oh, this is a Taco Standard
Time tradition.

09:46.289 --> 09:48.740
Spring forward, fire back.
It's "fall back," you

09:48.875 --> 09:50.492
ignoramus.
And your version of daylight

09:50.626 --> 09:53.578
savings time has existed for 24
hours, so it's not a tradition.

09:53.713 --> 09:56.088
I don't have time for this.
I have to go to work.

09:56.208 --> 09:58.528
But do not burn down my house.
You can't tell me what to do

09:58.628 --> 10:02.130
from your time zone.
I don't know where he is.

10:02.248 --> 10:04.165
Did you try his house?
Did you try his car?

10:04.300 --> 10:09.587
He can sometimes have...
MacArthur!

10:09.722 --> 10:12.007
Um... no.
We-- I mean, we can keep going

10:12.141 --> 10:13.892
on about this, but it's been a
half hour already.

10:14.010 --> 10:15.977
Where the hell were you?
You missed the whole deposition!

10:16.095 --> 10:17.896
I-I'm sorry.
My clocks were all screwed up

10:18.014 --> 10:19.564
because of this TST thing,
and...

10:19.682 --> 10:21.232
TST?
Taco Standard Time.

10:21.350 --> 10:23.518
I'm working with this alternate
time zone...

10:23.653 --> 10:26.771
Look, because of you, a
career criminal is gonna be back

10:26.906 --> 10:28.690
out on the streets.
You messed up this time,

10:28.824 --> 10:30.659
MacArthur.
You messed up bad.

10:30.776 --> 10:32.694
I'm sorry, I just...
I-I have a lot on my plate right

10:32.828 --> 10:34.913
now.
Um...

10:35.031 --> 10:37.699
A friend of mine tried to commit
suicide last night.

10:37.833 --> 10:40.035
A friend of yours?
Yes.

10:40.169 --> 10:42.620
He tried to slash his wrists
several times, and... just...

10:42.755 --> 10:43.872
Oh, God.
What?

10:44.006 --> 10:45.540
Oh, God...
Oh.

10:45.675 --> 10:48.259
Oh. Okay.
Didn't know we were doing that.

10:48.377 --> 10:51.846
Look... I've been there.
My fraternity brother, Dan, he

10:51.964 --> 10:54.132
tried a couple of times.
My God, I'm so sorry, Mr.

10:54.266 --> 10:55.884
Lipscombe.
Your friend needs you.

10:56.018 --> 10:58.386
Why don't you just take the rest
of the day off?

10:58.521 --> 11:00.355
What? Oh.
Okay.

11:00.473 --> 11:02.891
Garbage time.
I think I'll have the

11:03.025 --> 11:04.859
fajitas, please.
You're ordering already?

11:04.977 --> 11:06.361
Yeah, I want to get through
this quickly.

11:06.479 --> 11:07.946
Right.
Yeah, I'll have the same.

11:08.064 --> 11:09.280
All right.
Did you read this?

11:09.398 --> 11:11.066
Sure, uh, you know, I read,
uh... the first-first couple of

11:11.200 --> 11:12.784
pages, kind of got a sense of
it. What about you?

11:12.902 --> 11:14.285
I skimmed it and then read
the end.

11:14.403 --> 11:15.843
Good. What happens?
I'm lying to you.

11:15.955 --> 11:17.322
I didn't read it.
I just scanned...

11:17.456 --> 11:19.074
I-I came down here for you.
I just scanned, looking for

11:19.208 --> 11:21.042
my name.
Oh. Hi, Lane.

11:21.160 --> 11:22.827
Hi.
Ooh.

11:22.962 --> 11:24.996
Mmm.
Rod.

11:25.131 --> 11:27.799
Hey, Lane.
How are we doing?

11:27.917 --> 11:30.385
Well, better.
Good!

11:30.503 --> 11:33.588
It was dark days for a while,
but now...

11:33.723 --> 11:35.724
On the up and up.
Did you slit your wrists?

11:35.841 --> 11:38.009
No, I tried to put heavy
rocks in my pockets and wander

11:38.144 --> 11:40.311
into Lake Michigan, but the
rocks were too heavy and I

11:40.429 --> 11:43.098
strained my wrists, so... these
are supports.

11:43.232 --> 11:46.151
Anyway, I'm doing better.
I started a new business.

11:46.268 --> 11:49.521
I sell fair-trade tampons out of
my bike basket.

11:49.655 --> 11:52.524
It's Lane's Lunar Madness for
Your Feminine Messes.

11:52.658 --> 11:54.943
Enough about me.
I keep yakking about myself.

11:55.077 --> 11:57.328
Did you guys read it?
What... I'm dying to hear your

11:57.446 --> 11:58.696
thoughts.
Yeah...

11:58.831 --> 12:00.031
Did we read it?
Yes.

12:00.166 --> 12:02.534
I mean, it was... obviously
very sad, but also...

12:02.668 --> 12:04.335
We appreciated it wasn't so
one-note.

12:04.453 --> 12:06.037
Let's talk specifics.
What did you think about the

12:06.172 --> 12:07.622
stuff about my dad?
Wow.

12:07.757 --> 12:09.124
Well, that was my favorite part.

12:09.258 --> 12:10.959
That was...
The presence of your dad

12:11.093 --> 12:12.877
obviously...
That force.

12:13.012 --> 12:14.546
...loomed large.
That force.

12:14.680 --> 12:16.765
And I think he regretted a lot
of those things he said to you,

12:16.882 --> 12:20.185
you know?
I never met my dad.

12:20.302 --> 12:22.554
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

12:22.688 --> 12:24.139
Yeah.
How long did I want the juice

12:24.273 --> 12:26.357
cleanse that everyone began at
my funeral to last?

12:26.475 --> 12:27.942
I mean, you know, it's, uh,
standard.

12:28.060 --> 12:29.394
It's a ten... typical
ten-day...

12:29.528 --> 12:31.312
25 days.
I wanted people sick.

12:31.447 --> 12:33.148
You know what?
You didn't read it... fine.

12:33.282 --> 12:35.033
We're gonna read it now.
You're gonna read this whole

12:35.151 --> 12:36.534
thing right now?
What, right...

12:36.652 --> 12:38.203
"A Tale of Insufferable Pain.

12:38.320 --> 12:41.406
As a boy, I expected that my
life would be a kaleidoscope--

12:41.540 --> 12:44.292
a beautiful tube in which colors
and shapes danced elegantly."

12:44.410 --> 12:46.294
You're not even reading it.
Do you have this memorized?

12:46.412 --> 12:49.214
Yes.
"I worry that I will be hunted

12:49.331 --> 12:51.883
like Malcolm X..."
Looks great.

12:52.001 --> 12:56.304
"In committing suicide, I
join my peers: Miles Davis,

12:56.422 --> 13:01.259
Pablo Picasso, Golda Meir,
Harry Truman..."

13:01.393 --> 13:02.977
Mm-hmm.
"...Jesus Christ..."

13:03.095 --> 13:04.679
Yeah?
"...Allah.

13:04.814 --> 13:06.347
And so..."
Oh. No.

13:06.482 --> 13:08.016
What are you doing?
We're listening.

13:08.150 --> 13:09.851
I know that you said a bunch of
names of people who didn't

13:09.985 --> 13:11.519
actually commit suicide.
Yeah.

13:11.654 --> 13:13.771
They're my peers spiritually
and if you weren't spending all

13:13.906 --> 13:16.941
your energy stuffing your face,
you would've heard that.

13:17.076 --> 13:19.410
I've seen actual starving
people, okay?

13:19.528 --> 13:22.280
I've deejayed for them.
You're not starving people.

13:22.414 --> 13:24.499
I'm out of here.
Peter, I will forgive you later.

13:24.617 --> 13:27.035
Rod, I will never forgive you,
and if you ever want to see

13:27.169 --> 13:29.289
these Green Bay Packer tickets,
read the suicide note.

13:29.338 --> 13:31.956
Then we'll talk.
Uh...

13:32.091 --> 13:33.875
I can't read this note, so
you're gonna have to read it,

13:34.009 --> 13:35.627
get the tickets and then you can
take me to the game.

13:35.761 --> 13:37.322
They're my tickets.
You have to read it.

13:37.429 --> 13:39.514
Okay, maybe I will read it
and maybe I'll take Kevin.

13:39.632 --> 13:41.883
Or maybe I'll take Andre.
Or maybe I'll take that cute

13:42.017 --> 13:44.178
girl in the cubicle across from
me, who hates football.

13:44.186 --> 13:47.388
Challenge accepted.
All right.

13:52.814 --> 13:55.070
Hmm.
Kevin, we need to talk.

13:55.601 --> 13:57.185
What do you want?

13:57.319 --> 13:59.988
I lied to you.
These scratches... are not

14:00.106 --> 14:02.190
from catnip.
The situation with Milady and I

14:02.324 --> 14:04.526
has gotten out of hand.
What does this have to do

14:04.660 --> 14:06.277
with me? I don't care.
You're the commissioner.

14:06.412 --> 14:08.580
I have to come to you because I
need your help.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.331
Did you watch the video I sent?
No.

14:10.449 --> 14:12.167
I don't watch any of the videos
you send, Andre.

14:12.284 --> 14:13.868
Come on, they're good.
Not after the ALS bucket

14:14.003 --> 14:15.336
challenge video.
Do you remember that?

14:15.454 --> 14:17.672
I explained that to you.
It was an homage to <i> Silence of</i>

14:17.790 --> 14:19.374
<i>the Lambs.</i>
Those children were minors,

14:19.508 --> 14:20.925
okay?
You could've been arrested.

14:21.043 --> 14:22.427
Okay...
And then you come back with

14:22.545 --> 14:24.129
the "Feeling Nuts" video. Huh?
Well, that was unclear,

14:24.263 --> 14:25.880
because I thought you had to
grab somebody else's nuts.

14:26.015 --> 14:27.799
You don't go around grabbing
people's testicles, Andre!

14:27.933 --> 14:29.434
I thought that's how you got
them to join in.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.113
I shouldn't have to explain
that to you.

14:31.187 --> 14:32.554
Okay, but we raised money.
Just forget it.

14:32.688 --> 14:34.168
What do you want to talk about,
Andre?

14:34.223 --> 14:36.384
It's security cam footage
from an elevator after Milady

14:36.442 --> 14:38.643
and I left our pet therapist.

14:43.199 --> 14:46.451
Milady and I... have reached a
crossroads.

14:46.569 --> 14:49.037
Oh, Milady...
And I just feel like I want to

14:49.155 --> 14:51.990
give up.
I'm done with it, and nothing

14:52.124 --> 14:56.711
can stop me now.
I am over.

14:56.829 --> 14:58.546
Oh.
Hi.

14:58.664 --> 15:00.632
Um... Mr. Lipscombe, how are
you?

15:00.749 --> 15:02.834
Excuse me for butting in.
I'm Gary Lipscombe.

15:02.968 --> 15:04.669
You must be Kevin's friend.
Yeah.

15:04.804 --> 15:07.338
Oh, wow.
Those look really fresh.

15:07.473 --> 15:09.841
Yeah, it's been a rough
couple of nights.

15:09.975 --> 15:13.895
Don't give up.
Easy for you to say.

15:14.013 --> 15:16.181
Okay.
Thank you.

15:16.315 --> 15:18.266
Let's get back to this...
Okay.

15:18.400 --> 15:22.020
...for a second.
Jesus, Lane, come on.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.823
It's impossible.
I'll get that right to you.

15:24.940 --> 15:26.691
Uh, Jeremy.
Yeah?

15:26.826 --> 15:28.443
Listen, I gotta reach out to
you, man.

15:28.577 --> 15:30.161
I could really use some help.
Okay.

15:30.279 --> 15:32.247
Could you read this and, uh,
just tell me what you think

15:32.364 --> 15:33.948
about it?
Uh... sure.

15:34.083 --> 15:35.783
Thank you so much, man.
I just... I'm really struggling

15:35.918 --> 15:37.252
with this, you know?
Okay.

15:37.369 --> 15:39.009
I appreciate it.
Yeah, yeah, no, no, not a

15:39.038 --> 15:45.376
problem.
Holy shit.

15:45.511 --> 15:47.262
Wow.
Wow.

15:47.379 --> 15:49.097
This needs to be handled
correctly.

15:49.215 --> 15:50.932
What do we do?
Show it to the other guys?

15:51.050 --> 15:52.934
Absolutely not.
That would cause them to lose

15:53.052 --> 15:54.769
all respect for you, Andre.
And they have such little to

15:54.887 --> 15:56.604
begin with now, all right?
I think we just pretend that I

15:56.722 --> 15:58.439
never saw this.
Hey, what are you guys

15:58.557 --> 16:00.275
talking about?
Nothing. Nothing at all.

16:00.392 --> 16:02.110
Nothing.
So, guys, I hear you're

16:02.228 --> 16:04.395
having a hard time with the TST
conversion, so I got you all

16:04.530 --> 16:08.449
Taco Standard Time watches.
From now on, it's Taco clock all

16:08.567 --> 16:11.870
the time.
Yeah, I don't want a watch.

16:11.987 --> 16:16.124
Hey, Andre, so listen.
I called the hospital because

16:16.242 --> 16:19.043
I've been worried about you.
Me?

16:19.161 --> 16:21.412
Dr. Harvat is here to help
you.

16:21.547 --> 16:23.414
As you can see clearly, he's
still a danger to himself.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.416
Oh, what are you talking...?
I'm not, I'm not suicidal.

16:25.551 --> 16:27.418
Hello, Andre.
Hi.

16:27.553 --> 16:29.420
It's gonna be okay.
Okay, but I know it's gonna

16:29.555 --> 16:31.435
be okay, I'm fine...
It will be okay if you come

16:31.557 --> 16:33.424
with me.
Yeah, Kevin! Taco! Tell him!

16:33.559 --> 16:35.519
I have a good life!
Kevin, tell him I have a great

16:35.561 --> 16:37.428
life!
You do.

16:37.563 --> 16:39.483
We just want you to get the
help you need, Andre.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.485
Come on! Come on, please!
It's Hilton or Wallace.

16:41.567 --> 16:43.434
Pete?

16:43.569 --> 16:45.603
Yeah?
Oh, thank God! You're okay.

16:45.738 --> 16:48.022
Listen, Jeremy showed me your
suicide note.

16:48.157 --> 16:50.575
Oh, that's not...
I'm really sorry, Pete, for

16:50.693 --> 16:53.328
everything that's going on.
Yeah, it's that...

16:53.445 --> 16:56.114
I think it would be best if
you left work and went home and

16:56.248 --> 16:58.249
just took the rest of the day
off to kind of get your head

16:58.367 --> 17:00.251
together.
And I need you to witness this.

17:00.369 --> 17:02.253
I'm giving you back your
property, which was read to but

17:02.371 --> 17:04.539
not by me.
You see, there's a, there's a

17:04.673 --> 17:07.008
liability issue here.
Company policy stipulates that

17:07.126 --> 17:09.711
if an employee's feeling
depressed, it's-it's better that

17:09.845 --> 17:12.597
they, um, try to get better at
home.

17:12.714 --> 17:15.599
So, just to be clear, you-you
want me to go home, do

17:15.718 --> 17:17.685
absolutely no work for the good
of the company?

17:17.803 --> 17:19.887
For the good of yourself!
And for the good of the company.

17:20.021 --> 17:21.888
You know, from a legal
standpoint.

17:22.023 --> 17:23.891
I'm gonna do this for you, Bill.

17:24.026 --> 17:25.893
Thank you.
I'm praying for you, buddy.

17:26.028 --> 17:27.988
In a non-denominational,
legally indemnifying way,

17:28.030 --> 17:29.897
we all are.
Okay.

17:30.032 --> 17:32.734
Hey, and, um, I read the
chapter about your boss, and I

17:32.868 --> 17:36.321
need to apologize if I've been
overly sexualizing you. I...

17:36.455 --> 17:38.406
It's something that happens from
time to time.

17:38.540 --> 17:40.408
You're really starting to...
You know what? Forget it.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.493
Forget it, yeah.
Just en-enjoy yourself and, uh,

17:42.628 --> 17:45.213
if I don't see you again...

17:46.999 --> 17:51.419
Well, okay, then.
Garbage time.

17:55.090 --> 17:57.251
Group, I guess you notice
that we have a new face among

17:57.309 --> 18:00.595
us.
I want you to welcome Andre.

18:00.729 --> 18:04.182
And please be as supportive as
possible because we want to

18:04.316 --> 18:06.484
create a safe environment.
First of all, you don't need

18:06.602 --> 18:09.187
to create a safe environment
because I don't belong here.

18:09.321 --> 18:11.189
Okay? I'm not depressed like you
guys, okay?

18:11.323 --> 18:13.323
Whoa, wait a minute, now.
That's a judgment, right?

18:13.325 --> 18:15.193
So, what do we do with
judgments?

18:15.327 --> 18:17.195
We take that judgment and we
throw it away. What do we do?

18:17.329 --> 18:19.197
Throw it away? All right...
You're not judging anybody.

18:19.331 --> 18:21.199
Throw it away.
There, I'll throw it, there.

18:21.333 --> 18:23.253
Well, you don't have to throw
away two, just one.

18:23.369 --> 18:25.286
Okay, fine, I'll save one for
next time, then.

18:25.421 --> 18:27.288
No, you can't do that.
You should pick up that

18:27.423 --> 18:29.457
judgment.
It's behind your chair.

18:29.591 --> 18:31.459
I get it...
I mean, I just thought...

18:31.593 --> 18:33.461
I thought it was a safe space.
Put it in your pocket.

18:33.595 --> 18:35.596
But then I'm keeping a ju...
All right.

18:35.714 --> 18:38.800
I'm keeping a judgment, okay.
I don't even know why I'm here.

18:38.934 --> 18:40.894
I have a great life.
I mean, sure, I have a little

18:40.936 --> 18:42.804
bit of a gluten allergy.
That's no big deal.

18:42.938 --> 18:44.858
I look for the GF on the menus.
I'm totally fine.

18:44.940 --> 18:46.808
I get you.
I'm sexually super confused,

18:46.942 --> 18:48.810
too, and my friends hate me as
well.

18:48.944 --> 18:50.812
You don't get me.
I do.

18:50.946 --> 18:52.814
No, you don't.
I do.

18:52.948 --> 18:54.816
Okay, so...
What did you just throw away

18:54.950 --> 18:56.818
there?
He doesn't get me.

18:56.952 --> 18:58.820
I threw that away.
That wasn't a judgment.

18:58.954 --> 19:00.822
He's speaking from his heart.
He's calling me names.

19:00.956 --> 19:02.956
What? Don't throw that away!
I'm not a name caller.

19:02.958 --> 19:05.159
You are a name caller!
Oh! That's a judgment.

19:05.294 --> 19:07.795
We throw that away.
You say it's a safe space,

19:07.913 --> 19:09.881
but I don't know what's going
on, what I'm throwing away, what

19:09.998 --> 19:11.883
I'm getting, all right?
And you guys are just all being

19:12.000 --> 19:14.886
weird, okay?
No! No! No! No! No! No!

19:15.003 --> 19:18.222
Hi, Andre. It's Lane again

19:18.340 --> 19:20.300
for the third time.
Are you cutting me out of your

19:20.342 --> 19:22.810
life?
I had to hear about Ménage à

19:22.928 --> 19:25.980
Cinq from a message board.
I could've told you about ménage

19:26.098 --> 19:28.599
à cinqs in real life.
I've lived them.

19:28.734 --> 19:30.852
I had a ménage à cinq with four
members of Ladysmith Black

19:30.986 --> 19:33.321
Mambazo when they played
Oberlin.

19:33.439 --> 19:37.191
I'm feeling real vintage-era
sadness right now.

19:37.326 --> 19:41.863
Summer-of-'78, Levi-501-style
sadness.

19:41.997 --> 19:46.200
I don't know, I don't know.
I got to go.

19:46.335 --> 19:48.870
I've been really focused on

19:49.004 --> 19:50.872
getting that spark back with
Milady, but she won't meet me

19:51.006 --> 19:53.091
halfway.
She doesn't care.

19:53.208 --> 19:55.259
You're always worried about
what Milady thinks.

19:55.377 --> 19:57.845
You should start thinking about
what Andre thinks.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.083
What am I gonna do-- just let
her loose on the street?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.183
You know, who's gonna feed her?
Whose gonna take care of her?

20:02.301 --> 20:04.268
You need to get out of this
relationship.

20:04.386 --> 20:06.888
I think you, you have to,
like, let go of her.

20:07.022 --> 20:09.273
Yeah, maybe you're right.
I need to make decisions for

20:09.391 --> 20:11.642
Andre.
And then you no longer open

20:11.777 --> 20:14.061
yourself to being hurt by your
lady.

20:14.196 --> 20:16.063
And you know what?
I'm gonna bring her to that

20:16.198 --> 20:18.065
groomer to get her claws
trimmed, too.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.080
You mean her fingernails?
No, no, no. Her claws.

20:20.202 --> 20:22.069
You know, she's been scratching
me up and down.

20:22.204 --> 20:24.244
You take this catnip away from
her and...

20:24.373 --> 20:26.491
...she went nuts.
Those are cat scratches?

20:26.625 --> 20:29.544
Yeah, Milady's a cat, my cat.
We sat here and opened up our

20:29.661 --> 20:31.913
hearts to you and you're talking
about your stupid cat?!

20:32.047 --> 20:34.165
Okay, I'm feeling a
little bit of judgment.

20:34.299 --> 20:37.385
I heard you talk about all
your stupid clothes and your

20:37.503 --> 20:41.722
loft and that idiotic cat?
No, you can't... No.

20:41.840 --> 20:45.446
It goes there.
You're a whiny, superficial,

20:45.566 --> 20:48.440
petty little man!
I feel very judged here!

20:48.560 --> 20:49.900
You are being judged!
You are!

20:53.910 --> 20:57.013
This suicide note is so

20:57.055 --> 20:58.922
dense.
Boarding School Thomas is the

20:59.057 --> 21:01.008
same as Semester At Sea Thomas,
right?

21:01.142 --> 21:03.176
You know, I know everything
that's in that note and I didn't

21:03.311 --> 21:05.178
even have to read it.
How is that possible?

21:05.313 --> 21:07.180
It went viral around my office.

21:07.315 --> 21:09.675
So, everybody's been asking me
about my complex relationship

21:09.684 --> 21:12.204
with my sister, what happened on
the seventh grade field trip...

21:12.270 --> 21:14.154
Ooh, what did happen on that
field trip?

21:14.272 --> 21:16.156
You got to keep reading to
figure it out.

21:16.274 --> 21:18.408
You'll get there, buddy.
Okay, I need to share

21:18.526 --> 21:20.410
something with you guys.
Something that is highly, highly

21:20.528 --> 21:23.280
sensitive.
But I feel like it is my duty as

21:23.414 --> 21:26.116
commissioner to not mishandle
this situation.

21:26.251 --> 21:28.368
Plus, it involves Andre and his
cat.

21:28.503 --> 21:30.370
Ooh!
Yeah.

21:30.505 --> 21:34.625
Okay, prepare yourselves for
this.

21:34.759 --> 21:37.678
Oh, Milady, aren't you...?
Aw, that's sweet.

21:37.795 --> 21:39.680
Hmm, wait for it.
Oh, oh, God!

21:39.797 --> 21:41.682
Oh, Milady!
Ooh!

21:41.799 --> 21:43.700
Oh, my God.
Wow!

21:43.835 --> 21:46.053
Jesus!

21:46.187 --> 21:49.473
Oh, my God! Poor Andre.
He's out.

21:49.607 --> 21:51.858
And then the cat just, like,
walks over him like nothing

21:51.976 --> 21:53.860
happened.
What are we gonna do with

21:53.978 --> 21:55.862
this?
We got to suspend this cat.

21:55.980 --> 21:57.864
Commissioner, how long have
you had this video?

21:57.982 --> 21:59.700
I just received this material.

21:59.817 --> 22:01.702
Great answer, Goodell.
How long have you actually had

22:01.819 --> 22:03.704
the video?
No, I mean, I watched it 500

22:03.821 --> 22:05.706
times, but I just got it.

22:05.823 --> 22:07.708
Hold on a second.
Oh, my God!

22:07.825 --> 22:10.210
Oh, my God, Lane just sent a
suicide tweet?

22:10.328 --> 22:12.379
"Good-bye, friends.
Hate myself.

22:12.497 --> 22:16.717
Going to end it tonight.
#VerySad, #ForReals."

22:16.834 --> 22:19.586
Who sends a suicide tweet?
We did kind of rib him for

22:19.721 --> 22:25.008
how long the suicide note was.
Packers tickets.

22:25.143 --> 22:27.143
I'm gonna go grab something
from my car real quick.

22:27.145 --> 22:29.012
Pardon me, Jenny.
Sorry.

22:29.147 --> 22:30.931
No way.
Oh, son of a bitch!

22:31.065 --> 22:32.816
I don't think so!
Hey, hey! Guys!

22:32.934 --> 22:34.851
No, no, no, no, no!
So, what do we do now?

22:34.986 --> 22:36.937
Do we retweet it?
I think we favorite it.

22:37.071 --> 22:39.239
Yeah.

22:43.745 --> 22:47.948
Tonight, Lane, you play
panpipes in hell!

22:49.200 --> 22:51.785
Hey, Wayne.
Taco?

22:51.919 --> 22:53.787
Aw, you like to car-huff,
too? Awesome!

22:53.921 --> 22:55.789
What are you doing here?
We were supposed to hang out

22:55.923 --> 22:57.791
this morning!
Yeah, it is this morning.

22:57.925 --> 23:00.045
Oh, wait, are you still on that
daylight savings shit?

23:00.178 --> 23:02.212
No, no, man.
TST is where it's at.

23:02.347 --> 23:04.431
No, this is not a good time.
It's always a good time when

23:04.549 --> 23:08.218
you're car-huffing.
All right, let me take a hit.

23:08.353 --> 23:12.105
Oh, yeah!

23:12.223 --> 23:14.775
That's some smooth shit.
Oh, I'm getting very

23:14.892 --> 23:17.978
lightheaded.
I think I'm gonna pass out.

23:18.112 --> 23:21.148
No, just...
Oh, sh... Oh, shit!

23:21.282 --> 23:23.567
Lane! Lane.
Lane, wake up!

23:23.701 --> 23:26.286
We read your suicide note!
He's not moving.

23:26.404 --> 23:29.956
I think he's dead.
Oh, my God.

23:30.074 --> 23:31.958
Lane?
Lane?

23:32.076 --> 23:33.960
Oh!

23:34.078 --> 23:36.163
Are you stoned?

23:36.297 --> 23:38.882
Have you been smoking pot?
Yes, Mother.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.084
Found it.
It was under your seat.

23:41.219 --> 23:43.086
What is going on?
Taco has agreed to invest in

23:43.221 --> 23:45.756
Lane's Lunar Madness.
I gave him $5,000 up front

23:45.890 --> 23:47.974
and $40 million in stock
options.

23:48.092 --> 23:50.260
Top-shelf sanitation for your
monthly menstruation.

23:50.395 --> 23:54.097
Lane, listen, we are so happy
that you are still with us.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.767
And you didn't take that ticket
up to Heaven...

23:56.901 --> 23:58.769
Yeah, you still got those
tickets to the Packers game.

23:58.903 --> 24:00.821
You know, 'cause I'm free.
And I'm free.

24:00.938 --> 24:02.823
I'll go to breakfast with you
beforehand even.

24:02.940 --> 24:05.442
Because Taco has shown such
largesse, I've given him one of

24:05.576 --> 24:08.829
the tickets.
Yeah, Bears versus Packages,

24:08.946 --> 24:11.281
here I come!
Now, Peter, we've had our ups

24:11.416 --> 24:14.668
and downs lately, but you remain
my best friend.

24:14.786 --> 24:18.121
So, you will be going to the
game with Taco.

24:18.256 --> 24:20.924
Now, Rodney, I see you there

24:21.042 --> 24:24.678
throbbing with Semitic fury.
There's good news for you, too.

24:24.796 --> 24:27.297
You're free Sunday morning.
I'm free Sunday morning.

24:27.432 --> 24:29.758
Boys' brunch-- you and me.

24:29.878 --> 24:31.704
- ***
- See what I'm gonna do?

24:31.824 --> 24:32.964
I'm gonna pouch an egg...

24:33.349 --> 24:35.765
The only furniture I have is a hammock.

24:35.885 --> 24:38.741
But we can both share that
and we'll rock back and forth...
