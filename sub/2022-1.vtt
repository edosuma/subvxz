00:53.336 --> 00:55.449
Fuck.

01:03.179 --> 01:05.087
Fuck.

01:05.381 --> 01:07.916
Fucking fuck!

01:07.917 --> 01:09.757
Watch it, old man.

01:17.360 --> 01:20.975
What the fuck? You're doing it wrong!

01:21.664 --> 01:23.699
Needle is doing
what the needle does.

01:24.934 --> 01:26.935
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

01:26.936 --> 01:29.277
<i>The irezumi does not hide
the skin.</i>

01:29.339 --> 01:31.840
The tattoo reveals
the nature of the man...

01:31.841 --> 01:36.093
<i>and illuminates the 4 noble
professions in The Book of 5 Rings:</i>

01:36.246 --> 01:40.249
The warrior, the artist,
the merchant and the farmer.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.885
If there is a conflict
between the needle and the skin...

01:42.886 --> 01:45.687
between the mark and the man...

01:45.688 --> 01:50.202
then perhaps the path you've chosen
is not the path for which you're suited.

01:51.494 --> 01:53.295
What did you just say, old man?

01:53.296 --> 01:54.738
Huh?

01:55.064 --> 01:57.566
I know you didn't just disrespect me,
did you?

01:57.567 --> 01:59.535
You that fucking stupid?

01:59.536 --> 02:03.287
You disrespect me and I'll tattoo
the ceiling with your fucking brains.

02:06.509 --> 02:08.656
No disrespect.

02:09.512 --> 02:11.380
You're lucky.

02:11.381 --> 02:15.599
I can't kill you
until you finish this thing. Bang.

02:16.319 --> 02:17.953
Give me that mirror.

02:17.954 --> 02:20.155
Let's see how it's looking.

02:20.156 --> 02:21.857
Not bad, not bad.

02:21.858 --> 02:23.959
Hey, boss.
This just came for you.

02:23.960 --> 02:26.710
- What is it?
- A letter.

02:26.830 --> 02:28.579
So open it, dumbass.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.570
What?

02:34.571 --> 02:38.220
- What is it?
- It looks like sand.

02:39.375 --> 02:41.910
Yep. Sand.

02:41.911 --> 02:44.252
- Black sand.
- No.

02:47.116 --> 02:48.558
You know what this is?

02:49.786 --> 02:51.626
You wanna let us in on the joke?

02:51.754 --> 02:56.370
Years ago I watched a man
open an envelope like that one.

02:56.626 --> 02:58.694
There were many with him.

02:58.695 --> 03:02.811
And they laughed as you laugh now.

03:03.166 --> 03:06.602
And then it came from the shadows...

03:06.603 --> 03:10.286
and their laughter
was drowned in blood.

03:12.342 --> 03:15.183
What came out of the shadows?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.186
I cannot say the word.

03:17.380 --> 03:19.197
What word?

03:21.951 --> 03:24.386
That night...

03:24.387 --> 03:27.256
one of their blades struck here.

03:27.257 --> 03:30.292
I should have died
but for an accident of birth.

03:30.293 --> 03:35.512
My heart is here, on the other side.

03:37.533 --> 03:39.868
The fuck is that?

03:39.869 --> 03:42.585
It looks like a ninja, boss.

03:43.439 --> 03:45.007
A ninja?

03:45.008 --> 03:49.317
Are you kidding me? That's the word
you're afraid to say? Ninja?

03:49.846 --> 03:53.215
Ninja, ninja, ninja.
Yeah, you old fuck.

03:54.450 --> 03:56.165
Yeah, you had me going.

03:56.219 --> 04:00.756
- Ninja. That's some good shit.
- Ninja.

04:24.013 --> 04:26.126
Wanna fuck with me, huh?

04:29.018 --> 04:30.892
Wanna fuck with me?

05:14.530 --> 05:18.543
Look, you don't have to do this.

05:18.668 --> 05:22.037
Whatever they're paying you,
I'll double it.

05:22.038 --> 05:23.685
I'll triple it.

05:23.740 --> 05:25.352
You hear me?

05:25.375 --> 05:27.175
I'll pay you whatever you want.

05:27.176 --> 05:29.845
You cannot bargain with it,
you cannot reason with it...

05:29.846 --> 05:33.115
because it is not a human being.

05:33.116 --> 05:36.151
It is a demon sent straight from hell.

05:36.152 --> 05:37.953
You shut your face, old man!

05:37.954 --> 05:40.238
I'll blow your fuck...

06:00.810 --> 06:04.413
For 57 years, I've told your story.

06:04.414 --> 06:10.202
No one ever believed me,
but you are real, aren't you?

06:28.905 --> 06:31.052
Is all that for the Delgata case?

06:32.442 --> 06:33.986
This is Delgata.

06:34.644 --> 06:36.478
- And the rest?
- Evidence.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.246
For?

06:38.247 --> 06:40.282
Oh, no, not again, Mika, please.

06:40.283 --> 06:42.984
What is the problem?
You've trusted my research before.

06:42.985 --> 06:46.121
Here's a question. Which of these
does not belong in this sentence:

06:46.122 --> 06:50.374
Laptop, space shuttle,
nanotechnology, ninja.

06:51.027 --> 06:54.175
All I'm asking for is an hour.
That's all.

06:56.065 --> 06:59.009
Why do I think I'm gonna regret this?

06:59.235 --> 07:00.702
Remember the Eulmi Incident?

07:00.703 --> 07:03.772
Korean queen, late 1800s,
killed by one of these ninja clans.

07:03.773 --> 07:05.807
Ozunu, I think.

07:05.808 --> 07:09.644
Now, I've been going through
the original transcripts of the trial...

07:09.645 --> 07:11.189
of Kunitomo Shigeaki.

07:11.347 --> 07:16.017
The prosecutor questioned Shigeaki
about a payment of 100 pounds of gold.

07:16.018 --> 07:19.521
Shigeaki answered that he didn't know
what the prosecutor was talking about.

07:19.522 --> 07:21.456
The question
was never brought up again.

07:21.457 --> 07:24.059
But what pinged for me was the amount.

07:24.060 --> 07:27.329
The exact same amount rumored
to have been paid to the Ozunu Clan...

07:27.330 --> 07:30.866
for the yakuza massacre that happened
last week in Osaka.

07:30.867 --> 07:33.034
So you wonder,
in this ever-changing world...

07:33.035 --> 07:35.270
if the cost of a man's life
remains the same.

07:35.271 --> 07:39.274
Exactly. I mean, I figure these clans
are like, what, a thousand years old?

07:39.275 --> 07:40.990
They probably don't change.

07:41.110 --> 07:45.013
So I started looking at
international wire transfers...

07:45.014 --> 07:49.718
targeting banks in the regions
of several high-profile assassinations.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.299
And bingo.
Russian Prime Minister Zhukov.

07:52.321 --> 07:54.389
The day before the assassination...

07:54.390 --> 07:59.494
1,555,999 dollars and 90 cents...

07:59.495 --> 08:02.405
was transferred
from the Bank of Shanghai.

08:02.498 --> 08:06.113
That is the exact market equivalent
of 100 pounds of gold.

08:07.637 --> 08:11.373
- Okay, you got me, this is interesting.
- The clans are real, Ryan.

08:11.374 --> 08:14.709
They steal children
and turn them into assassins.

08:14.710 --> 08:17.245
Look, Mika, no one's denying
the historical facts...

08:17.246 --> 08:19.814
but this thing doesn't make sense
in a modern world.

08:19.815 --> 08:23.451
They're real. You can call them spooks
or assassins or whatever you want...

08:23.452 --> 08:27.856
if it makes you feel better, but they are
out there and they are killing people.

08:27.857 --> 08:30.334
And nobody is doing a damn thing
to stop them.

08:37.832 --> 08:39.946
Hi. Excuse me.

08:40.135 --> 08:41.510
Would you mind?

08:42.138 --> 08:45.184
If it's not too much trouble,
could you help me with this?

09:01.023 --> 09:02.965
What clan are you from?

09:04.293 --> 09:06.061
What are you doing in Berlin?

09:06.062 --> 09:07.811
I don't understand.

09:29.986 --> 09:32.065
What is going on?

09:47.470 --> 09:48.770
You found something?

09:48.771 --> 09:52.407
I was digging around trying to see what
I could come up with and I found this.

09:52.408 --> 09:55.243
A report. A friend of mine in Moscow
tipped me to it.

09:55.244 --> 09:57.145
It was written during the Cold War...

09:57.146 --> 10:00.982
by a high-ranking KGB agent
named Alexi Sabatin.

10:00.983 --> 10:04.386
He raises the possibility that
a number of political assassinations...

10:04.387 --> 10:07.255
were conducted by an ancient
but sophisticated network...

10:07.256 --> 10:10.097
he calls the Nine Clans.

10:10.459 --> 10:14.062
- Mind you, he doesn't call them ninjas.
- What happened to him?

10:14.063 --> 10:17.143
Same thing that's gonna happen to me
if I hang around with you.

10:17.833 --> 10:20.708
Kicked out of the service
for mental instability.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.419
You believe it now, don't you?

10:24.307 --> 10:26.352
Ninjas.

10:26.442 --> 10:29.659
- You gotta be joking.
- Well, then why are you doing all this?

10:30.279 --> 10:31.479
I don't know.

10:31.480 --> 10:34.382
But I can guarantee you
it has nothing to do with the fact...

10:34.383 --> 10:37.930
that you're the most attractive
researcher I have ever worked with.

10:49.799 --> 10:51.166
Oh, Mr. Nan.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.567
Good, you are back.

10:52.568 --> 10:56.319
We had a heating problem,
and I had to go into your apartment.

10:57.506 --> 11:00.542
- Is it all right?
- It's all fixed.

11:00.543 --> 11:03.044
You keep it very dark and spare in there.

11:03.045 --> 11:06.660
And forgive me, but I couldn't help
noticing your suitcases.

11:09.051 --> 11:11.853
<i>I told you,
my father was a very sick man.</i>

11:11.854 --> 11:13.655
<i>Do you have to leave Berlin soon?</i>

11:13.656 --> 11:16.591
<i>Not yet, but I am expecting a phone call.</i>

11:16.592 --> 11:18.827
<i>I'm sorry to hear that.</i>

11:18.828 --> 11:23.308
<i>One day, death will come for us all.</i>

11:41.283 --> 11:43.828
<i>Wherever you are...</i>

11:44.320 --> 11:47.332
wherever you may go...

11:50.726 --> 11:54.963
you must never forget who you are...

11:54.964 --> 11:57.942
how you came to be.

11:57.967 --> 12:00.512
You are Ozunu.

12:01.103 --> 12:03.387
You are part of me...

12:03.639 --> 12:06.007
as I am part of you.

12:06.008 --> 12:09.577
This is the truth of your lives...

12:09.578 --> 12:13.364
and it will remain true after death.

12:15.084 --> 12:17.425
This is my new son.

12:17.787 --> 12:21.664
I have given him the name Raizo.

12:21.824 --> 12:24.592
Welcome him as your brother.

12:24.593 --> 12:27.309
Welcome, Raizo.

12:47.950 --> 12:50.919
<i>The body must obey the will.</i>

12:50.920 --> 12:52.887
Hunger and thirst...

12:52.888 --> 12:57.402
even the blood in your veins,
are the body's weakness.

13:05.167 --> 13:06.745
Master them...

13:08.237 --> 13:11.181
and you master the self.

13:17.012 --> 13:21.149
This is the power of the Ozunu Clan.

13:21.150 --> 13:24.128
This is the way of the ninja.

13:24.720 --> 13:30.007
Eat tonight and you work
twice as hard tomorrow.

13:55.751 --> 13:58.228
What is the lesson?

13:59.321 --> 14:01.036
Look at your brother.

14:01.557 --> 14:03.499
Life is combat.

14:04.193 --> 14:06.511
You know this truth.

14:06.729 --> 14:09.497
Abandoned by your parents...

14:09.498 --> 14:13.340
without a home,
without people to care for you...

14:13.369 --> 14:15.770
you should have died.

14:15.771 --> 14:18.021
But instead you fought.

14:18.374 --> 14:22.777
As you did here today,
you fought and you won.

14:22.778 --> 14:28.449
In combat, you face the enemy
without doubt, without pity or remorse.

14:28.450 --> 14:32.361
To survive, you must learn
to fear nothing at all.

14:59.248 --> 15:02.829
<i>Pain breeds weakness.</i>

15:06.322 --> 15:09.607
Remember, suffering exists...

15:09.925 --> 15:13.574
only because weakness exists.

15:32.915 --> 15:34.782
You must hate all weakness.

15:34.783 --> 15:39.069
Hate it in others,
but most of all, hate it in yourself.

17:31.734 --> 17:33.735
- Mrs. Sabatin?
- Yeah.

17:33.736 --> 17:37.419
I'm Mika Coretti with Europol.
We spoke on the phone.

17:40.242 --> 17:42.677
You said you read
my husband's report, yes?

17:42.678 --> 17:44.052
Yes.

17:44.813 --> 17:49.016
I understand the report caused some
problems for him within the KGB.

17:49.017 --> 17:52.320
The report caused problems
for Alexi's career...

17:52.321 --> 17:57.291
the way Moses caused problems
for the Pharaoh. Very unpleasant.

17:57.292 --> 17:58.593
What happened?

17:58.594 --> 18:00.928
About two years ago...

18:00.929 --> 18:03.564
after the assassination of Zhukov...

18:03.565 --> 18:07.135
the report drew attention.

18:07.136 --> 18:09.036
After that...

18:09.037 --> 18:10.718
everything was different.

18:11.507 --> 18:16.711
Alexi hired men to change all the locks
and put in more of them.

18:16.712 --> 18:19.680
<i>Locks on the windows,
locks on the doors, locks on the locks.</i>

18:19.681 --> 18:22.283
<i>He put in cameras and motion sensors...</i>

18:22.284 --> 18:26.035
<i>and lights. Everywhere, lights.</i>

18:26.054 --> 18:29.271
"There can be no shadows," he said.

18:30.592 --> 18:32.068
"No shadows".

18:33.695 --> 18:36.464
Then one day, a man came to the door.

18:36.465 --> 18:39.909
They talked in Alexi's study
for some time, and then...

18:40.402 --> 18:42.845
<i>the young man left.</i>

18:43.372 --> 18:45.640
My husband was a soldier.

18:45.641 --> 18:48.609
Member of Russian intelligence.

18:48.610 --> 18:51.087
He was not a man to frighten easily.

18:51.313 --> 18:56.450
<i>But when I came to the door,
in his eyes I saw fear.</i>

18:56.451 --> 18:59.153
<i>And then he stood up...</i>

18:59.154 --> 19:03.491
<i>he kissed me and told me
that he loved me very much.</i>

19:05.594 --> 19:07.639
He said...

19:09.331 --> 19:12.479
I should always remember that.

19:14.069 --> 19:16.003
Do you know what they talked about?

19:16.004 --> 19:20.120
No. He said it was safer that way.

19:21.109 --> 19:23.086
Can I ask how he died?

19:25.414 --> 19:27.782
The lights went out.

19:33.622 --> 19:38.807
You are the first person who has
taken my husband's work seriously.

19:40.028 --> 19:44.542
It would be good to know
that he did not die without cause.

19:54.176 --> 19:56.653
He would want you to have this.

20:52.000 --> 20:54.181
Who are you?

21:28.537 --> 21:30.115
Hiyah!

22:50.252 --> 22:52.365
Did Takeshi's blow hurt you?

22:52.754 --> 22:54.901
You think this is pain.

22:55.090 --> 22:56.737
You are mistaken.

23:13.642 --> 23:16.077
That is true pain.

23:17.245 --> 23:19.085
Here is your test, Raizo.

23:19.181 --> 23:20.896
Survive the night.

24:21.610 --> 24:23.951
Very good, Raizo.

24:24.112 --> 24:26.191
Very good.

24:36.224 --> 24:40.094
Boy, you're like a dog with a bone
on that computer, aren't you?

24:40.095 --> 24:41.503
Excuse me?

24:41.930 --> 24:43.697
Agent Zabranski...

24:43.698 --> 24:45.833
Internal Affairs.

24:45.834 --> 24:48.675
Need to ask you a couple of questions.

24:48.970 --> 24:51.705
- You're Mika Coretti, yeah?
- Mm-hm.

24:51.706 --> 24:54.208
Forensic researcher.

24:54.209 --> 24:56.925
You work a lot with Agent Maslow,
that right?

24:57.012 --> 24:59.079
A few cases, yeah.

24:59.080 --> 25:02.016
You have something
of a social relationship.

25:02.017 --> 25:05.859
- Excuse me?
- You had lunch with him on the 13th...

25:05.921 --> 25:08.000
and again on the 18th.

25:08.089 --> 25:09.497
How do you know that?

25:10.392 --> 25:13.093
- Isn't it true?
- I'm not sure.

25:13.094 --> 25:17.598
We do have lunch together sometimes,
but that's usually when we're working.

25:17.599 --> 25:21.268
Has Agent Maslow seemed different
to you lately in any way?

25:21.269 --> 25:25.005
I mean, has he said or done anything
that struck you as unusual?

25:25.006 --> 25:27.847
No. Why?

25:27.943 --> 25:30.090
Has Agent Maslow done something?

25:30.679 --> 25:32.613
Just routine.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.549
The agency cares about
its field operatives.

25:35.550 --> 25:39.286
We monitor for signs
of stress, fatigue...

25:39.287 --> 25:40.968
mental exhaustion.

25:41.756 --> 25:44.472
Agent Maslow has a serious caseload.

25:47.028 --> 25:50.677
That much work
can wear on a man, hm?

25:54.636 --> 25:56.108
Zabranski came to my office.

25:56.109 --> 25:58.138
Yeah,
I got a surprise visit too.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.923
He made it real clear, Ryan.
They're watching us.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.880
I don't get the full picture quite yet,
but I know a warning when I see one.

26:06.881 --> 26:09.950
- But why?
- Why? It's obvious.

26:09.951 --> 26:13.020
If this little fantasy of yours
has any chance of being real...

26:13.021 --> 26:16.957
then these clans are gonna have
some pretty major juice protecting them.

26:16.958 --> 26:18.959
So, what are you gonna do?

26:18.960 --> 26:23.097
We are gonna tiptoe very carefully
from here on in, you understand?

26:23.098 --> 26:25.882
You do nothing without
checking with me first.

26:26.101 --> 26:28.969
- Got it?
- Got it.

26:51.426 --> 26:56.530
<i>A 14th-century scroll refers to
one of the oldest of the Nine Clans...</i>

26:56.531 --> 26:58.906
<i>as the Clan of Black Sand.</i>

27:00.035 --> 27:04.638
<i>The Islamic explorer Ibn Battuta
journeyed with a group of orphans...</i>

27:04.639 --> 27:07.541
<i>that were being taken
to a remote shido...</i>

27:07.542 --> 27:10.292
<i>hidden among snowcapped mountains.</i>

27:10.545 --> 27:13.547
<i>Battuta describes a ceremonial dinner...</i>

27:13.548 --> 27:16.550
<i>followed by a display of martial skill.</i>

27:16.551 --> 27:21.065
<i>The combatants were children,
neither beyond the age of 10.</i>

27:21.690 --> 27:26.460
<i>His hosts explained that a man's life
must be made meaningless...</i>

27:26.461 --> 27:28.762
<i>compared to the life of the clan.</i>

27:28.763 --> 27:31.231
<i>Own the meaning of a man's life...</i>

27:31.232 --> 27:33.982
<i>and you own his heart.</i>

28:04.566 --> 28:09.236
You shouldn't do that. It's against
the rules. If they catch you...

28:09.237 --> 28:12.283
- Then they catch me.
- They'll put you in the box.

28:12.941 --> 28:17.387
I believe the heart of the tree
knows which way it needs to grow.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.657
- Trees don't have hearts.
- Everything has a heart.

28:23.752 --> 28:26.036
I don't.

28:26.287 --> 28:27.729
Really?

28:28.156 --> 28:29.632
Let me see.

28:34.129 --> 28:35.329
Hello?

28:39.601 --> 28:41.201
It's saying hello back...

28:41.202 --> 28:45.215
and that it's happy to meet me,
but it misses you.

28:46.341 --> 28:49.216
- Liar.
- I'm not lying.

28:49.411 --> 28:51.854
Listen to mine.

29:38.693 --> 29:43.497
For an entire year, you shall live
without one of your senses...

29:43.498 --> 29:47.648
<i>beginning with the sense
you rely on the most.</i>

30:07.155 --> 30:10.190
You must see with more
than your eyes.

32:32.233 --> 32:34.701
Cut him, Kiriko.

32:34.702 --> 32:37.816
All failure must be sown into the flesh.

32:39.273 --> 32:41.056
Cut him.

32:58.626 --> 33:00.102
You know the law.

34:17.071 --> 34:19.514
I told you.

34:19.774 --> 34:21.887
I tried to warn you.

34:22.476 --> 34:24.623
Yes.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.263
You did.

34:27.380 --> 34:29.358
Why, Kiriko?

34:30.685 --> 34:32.764
Why?

34:35.389 --> 34:37.934
Why am I in here...

34:38.493 --> 34:41.710
or why are you out there?

35:36.250 --> 35:38.295
Kiriko!

35:38.886 --> 35:40.669
Why are you doing this?

35:41.856 --> 35:43.230
I have to.

35:43.958 --> 35:47.800
You know the law.
He will cut your heart from your chest.

35:48.830 --> 35:50.772
No.

35:50.965 --> 35:52.942
He can never touch my heart.

36:13.421 --> 36:14.999
Come with me.

36:15.389 --> 36:18.299
Where? What is out there?

36:18.726 --> 36:20.600
Life.

36:25.166 --> 36:27.916
My life is here.

37:31.332 --> 37:32.532
Shh.

37:32.533 --> 37:34.367
Fucking Christ, Ryan.

37:34.368 --> 37:39.087
I'm sorry I couldn't talk earlier, Mika.
They're watching me. Get in.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.882
Where have you been?
I've been calling your office.

37:48.883 --> 37:50.894
Now I know how Sabatin must have felt.

37:50.918 --> 37:52.185
What's happened?

37:52.186 --> 37:55.188
<i>Right now I've got
Internal Affairs, Homeland Security...</i>

37:55.189 --> 37:58.291
<i>the CIA and for all I know
the Martian military in my office...</i>

37:58.292 --> 38:00.041
<i>tearing the place apart.</i>

38:00.861 --> 38:02.062
What are we gonna do?

38:02.063 --> 38:04.431
You are gonna pack your bags,
go on holiday.

38:04.432 --> 38:05.632
No way.

38:05.633 --> 38:08.001
Don't argue.
I trusted you, you gotta trust me.

38:08.002 --> 38:10.603
I'm sorry, I can't let you lose
your job because of me.

38:10.604 --> 38:13.873
I'm not talking about losing my job.
Take this.

38:13.874 --> 38:17.318
It's clean, untraceable, no serial number.

38:17.845 --> 38:20.313
- Ryan?
- Yeah, I know.

38:20.314 --> 38:24.617
I've investigated world bank organizations,
drug cartels, arms dealers.

38:24.618 --> 38:27.368
I've never faced this kind of heat.

38:27.555 --> 38:30.669
For ninjas. It's fucking unbelievable.

38:33.928 --> 38:35.905
Excuse me.

38:37.064 --> 38:39.332
- Hey.
- Hi.

38:39.333 --> 38:41.651
So, what's going on?

38:41.669 --> 38:47.007
Power's out. Us, the building behind us,
and that one across the street.

38:47.008 --> 38:50.156
It seems like every few months,
boom, the light's out.

38:51.645 --> 38:53.553
Okay.

38:53.681 --> 38:55.589
Thanks.

40:40.154 --> 40:41.596
Ah!

41:13.187 --> 41:15.488
- More will come.
- What?

41:15.489 --> 41:17.524
They won't stop until you're dead.

41:17.525 --> 41:19.672
Oh, God.

41:20.261 --> 41:21.794
A gun won't help you.

41:21.795 --> 41:24.063
Well,
I don't have a lot of options, okay?

41:24.064 --> 41:25.532
I once took a Tae Bo class...

41:25.533 --> 41:28.635
but that is the extent
of my kung-fu abilities, all right?

41:28.636 --> 41:32.444
I can help you, but you have to trust me.

41:36.877 --> 41:39.058
Okay.

41:54.895 --> 41:56.337
Do you know me?

41:58.632 --> 42:00.574
How?

42:02.303 --> 42:06.673
Security camera in New York
recorded you fighting one of them.

42:06.674 --> 42:08.116
You know about them?

42:09.009 --> 42:10.849
A little.

42:11.078 --> 42:13.623
Well, there are these clans.

42:13.747 --> 42:18.151
And, apparently, they've been
supplying assassins to governments...

42:18.152 --> 42:20.663
or anyone who has
100 pounds of gold...

42:20.854 --> 42:23.695
for the last thousand years.

42:23.991 --> 42:26.070
His name was Jin.

42:27.695 --> 42:29.796
Wait, you knew him?

42:29.797 --> 42:33.233
- He was not born an assassin.
- You're from his clan.

42:34.668 --> 42:37.179
- They why did you stop him?
- They're coming.

42:37.738 --> 42:39.578
Who?

42:46.247 --> 42:51.057
It was him,
the traitor, Raizo. Murderer.

42:52.119 --> 42:55.421
- Fresh kill.
- He's with the girl.

42:55.422 --> 42:56.889
Still close.

42:56.890 --> 42:59.674
Very close.

43:04.131 --> 43:07.382
Run, little brother, run.

43:08.869 --> 43:11.904
<i>Weakness compels strength.</i>

43:11.905 --> 43:14.607
<i>Betrayal begets blood.</i>

43:14.608 --> 43:17.210
<i>This is the law of the Nine Clans.</i>

43:17.211 --> 43:18.378
Ah!

43:47.374 --> 43:49.442
We have been betrayed.

43:49.443 --> 43:53.980
A child of mine, my daughter,
betrayed us.

43:53.981 --> 43:59.359
She refused my gifts, rejected our clan.

43:59.987 --> 44:04.330
Her shame can only be purged
with blood.

44:04.391 --> 44:06.333
You.

44:10.230 --> 44:14.778
You, my son, who returned her
shall have this honor.

44:45.132 --> 44:47.074
Ah!

45:00.714 --> 45:04.124
- Where are we going?
- Doesn't matter.

45:05.185 --> 45:07.387
You think they're following us?

45:07.388 --> 45:09.155
I know they're following us.

45:09.156 --> 45:11.906
I don't see anything back there.

45:11.925 --> 45:13.893
They have our scent.

45:13.894 --> 45:16.329
Following our scent? Like dogs?

45:16.330 --> 45:19.342
No. Like wolves.

45:22.236 --> 45:23.985
My name's Mika, by the way.

45:26.540 --> 45:30.018
Raizo is the name I was given.

45:30.644 --> 45:32.222
So you're an orphan?

45:35.282 --> 45:39.864
If it's okay with you, I'm gonna try
and fill in some of the blanks here.

45:40.120 --> 45:45.091
So you must have been taken by the
Ozunu Clan, trained to be an assassin...

45:45.092 --> 45:48.928
but something happened and you
decided to opt out of the program.

45:48.929 --> 45:51.731
Now, I don't imagine
that went over so well.

45:51.732 --> 45:54.600
Since they're after me
for just peeking through the keyhole...

45:54.601 --> 45:56.836
they must be after you
in, like, a major way.

45:56.837 --> 46:00.239
But you're also after them,
which is why you're in Berlin.

46:00.240 --> 46:03.142
Because Sabatin is one of the few people
pursuing the clans...

46:03.143 --> 46:05.427
which is why they took him out.

46:06.947 --> 46:09.458
But here's a question I can't answer.

46:11.084 --> 46:12.628
Why did you save me?

46:23.197 --> 46:27.500
Your entire life
has brought you to this moment.

46:27.501 --> 46:30.615
Do not fail yourself.

46:30.904 --> 46:33.313
Do not fail your family.

46:35.542 --> 46:38.292
He's wearing a gold watch.

46:38.512 --> 46:40.989
Bring it to me.

47:19.686 --> 47:21.833
That kind of tickled.

47:29.062 --> 47:32.540
It's gonna take more than a knitting needle
to fuck me up, boy!

48:10.070 --> 48:12.820
Ah!

49:08.161 --> 49:09.929
Keep it.

49:09.930 --> 49:11.631
It will remind you that...

49:11.632 --> 49:15.918
every moment of your life
is a gift I have given you.

49:19.306 --> 49:21.954
You have made me proud, my son.

49:22.643 --> 49:25.878
Now the time has come
for you to prove...

49:25.879 --> 49:28.754
you are true Ozunu.

49:35.255 --> 49:37.835
She tried to run from us...

49:38.425 --> 49:40.766
from our family.

49:43.930 --> 49:48.216
Takeshi caught her
and returned her to us.

49:49.369 --> 49:52.779
Weakness compels strength.

49:52.806 --> 49:55.283
Betrayal begets blood.

50:06.053 --> 50:09.668
This is the law of the Nine Clans.

50:24.838 --> 50:27.088
Hiyah!

50:30.610 --> 50:32.621
Kill him!

51:32.806 --> 51:34.206
You need protection.

51:34.207 --> 51:39.392
No. I want Ozunu,
and I need your help to get him.

51:41.915 --> 51:43.289
Exit here.

51:51.491 --> 51:54.527
- You are a size 36?
- What?

51:54.528 --> 51:56.607
No, size 34.

52:01.868 --> 52:03.685
If you leave while I'm gone...

52:03.837 --> 52:05.871
they'll hunt you and kill you.

52:05.872 --> 52:08.087
Do you understand?

52:26.827 --> 52:28.201
Get undressed.

52:28.628 --> 52:31.913
Shower, but do not use soap.
Do you smoke?

52:33.800 --> 52:35.515
Put your clothes in here.

52:38.839 --> 52:40.918
These jeans are a little tight.

52:41.775 --> 52:44.252
You said 34.

52:44.945 --> 52:50.699
Yeah, well, it's German sizes.
They must run a little small, I guess.

52:55.388 --> 52:58.502
This is for our scent. Right?

52:59.192 --> 53:01.271
Let's go.

53:05.565 --> 53:06.965
<i>- Yeah?
- Ryan, it's me.</i>

53:06.966 --> 53:10.735
- Mika, I've been calling you for hours.
- I know, I'm in a bit of trouble.

53:10.736 --> 53:12.704
You miss jury service, you're in trouble.

53:12.705 --> 53:14.906
You're in the deepest shit
you've ever been in.

53:14.907 --> 53:16.841
At least I'm not down here by myself.

53:16.842 --> 53:19.144
Sabatin's guy from the tape?
Is he with you?

53:19.145 --> 53:20.812
He's on our side, Ryan.

53:20.813 --> 53:23.529
He wants Ozunu,
but he needs the agency's help.

53:23.549 --> 53:26.217
- Be careful, Mika.
- I trust him.

53:26.218 --> 53:30.488
<i>All right, look, I can't make any promises,
but if he cooperates, I'll do what I can.</i>

53:30.489 --> 53:32.704
- Can you meet us?
- Where?

53:33.159 --> 53:34.806
How about the usual?

53:41.767 --> 53:43.641
There he is.

53:45.438 --> 53:48.621
Now, it's all right. He's a good guy.

53:50.276 --> 53:52.110
- Mika, are you okay?
- Yeah.

53:52.111 --> 53:54.122
Thanks to him.

53:54.347 --> 53:57.148
- Why have you done this?
- Done what?

53:57.149 --> 53:58.864
People will die.

53:59.151 --> 54:01.230
- Now!
- No!

54:01.320 --> 54:03.331
Don't move!

54:08.160 --> 54:11.104
This is wrong! No! No!

54:11.330 --> 54:12.942
<i>Charlie 2, do you read me?</i>

54:13.899 --> 54:15.409
Move him!

54:15.468 --> 54:18.269
What the fuck are you doing?

54:18.270 --> 54:20.315
Following orders.

54:23.009 --> 54:25.759
- Prisoner is secure, sir.
- Right.

54:25.878 --> 54:28.526
Sure doesn't look like
a killing machine to me, sir.

54:28.981 --> 54:30.958
Looks like he belongs in a boy band.

54:33.653 --> 54:36.471
He couldn't have heard that. Could he?

54:36.489 --> 54:39.524
- Sir?
- Ryan? This is wrong.

54:39.525 --> 54:41.526
I mean, it can't be legal.

54:41.527 --> 54:45.063
What is this place?
Your own private Guantanamo?

54:45.064 --> 54:49.000
It's an old GDR safe house.
Jamison wants this off the grid.

54:49.001 --> 54:51.770
You're making a huge mistake.

54:51.771 --> 54:53.605
I don't think so.

54:53.606 --> 54:57.475
I got reports from London, Washington
and Osaka, all tagging your boy.

54:57.476 --> 55:00.111
The only problem we have
is where to extradite him first.

55:00.112 --> 55:02.480
Two weeks ago,
there's no such thing as ninja...

55:02.481 --> 55:06.084
and now every city in the world
has a warrant for one?

55:06.085 --> 55:08.420
- He is not the enemy.
- He's a killer, Mika.

55:08.421 --> 55:10.755
Weren't you telling me
it was our job to stop him?

55:10.756 --> 55:13.992
- You're not even listening.
- You're not saying anything worth hearing.

55:13.993 --> 55:17.870
Wanna do the insubordination tango?
Let's go. But not in front of the children.

55:21.801 --> 55:23.868
Boys, get out.

55:23.869 --> 55:26.244
Come on, let's go!

55:27.606 --> 55:29.240
Damn it, I am just trying to...

55:29.241 --> 55:31.743
Shut up and listen to me.
We don't have much time.

55:31.744 --> 55:33.912
Now I don't know
what we've stumbled into...

55:33.913 --> 55:36.347
but somebody's pulling
some major strings inside.

55:36.348 --> 55:40.998
They want him dead.
He's been fighting them for years.

55:41.187 --> 55:43.221
I believe you.

55:43.222 --> 55:45.957
I've been in this business too long
not to smell a setup...

55:45.958 --> 55:48.526
but we have to be very careful
how we handle this...

55:48.527 --> 55:52.005
and I cannot risk
you going AWOL on me again.

55:52.098 --> 55:53.813
Now, if you get into trouble...

55:55.067 --> 55:56.835
you switch this on...

55:56.836 --> 56:00.212
and no matter where you are,
I'll find you.

56:22.061 --> 56:23.537
Hey.

56:26.599 --> 56:29.042
You looked thirsty.

56:58.230 --> 57:00.707
I'm sorry,
I didn't know about any of this.

57:01.133 --> 57:04.111
- I know.
- You do?

57:04.203 --> 57:07.750
The only time you lied to me
was when you told me your size.

57:10.109 --> 57:12.723
How did you know that?

57:13.012 --> 57:16.354
Your heart. It is special.

57:22.521 --> 57:26.307
Maslow's on our side.
He's gonna try to help you.

57:26.492 --> 57:28.833
It's too late.

57:30.029 --> 57:31.262
No one goes here.

57:31.263 --> 57:33.364
Ryan? Ryan, can I talk to you?

57:33.365 --> 57:35.706
Do we have to do this again, Coretti?

57:36.302 --> 57:38.142
I just...

57:38.170 --> 57:41.172
I have reason to believe a group
of ninja may be on their way.

57:41.173 --> 57:45.254
I think these gentlemen can handle a few
wackjobs wearing pajamas, am I right?

57:45.744 --> 57:48.279
- You see?
- Yeah, but the situation we discussed...

57:48.280 --> 57:49.480
I'm working on that.

57:49.481 --> 57:51.683
- You have to give me time.
- We don't have time.

57:51.684 --> 57:54.853
- They're not here now, are they?
- They'll be here soon.

57:54.854 --> 57:56.228
How soon?

57:59.925 --> 58:01.299
Raizo.

58:01.861 --> 58:05.009
- Mika! Go with her, secure the prisoner.
- Go, go, go.

58:06.298 --> 58:08.766
Team 2,
we're on our way down to the holding cell.

58:08.767 --> 58:09.934
<i>What's your 20?</i>

58:09.935 --> 58:12.981
<i>We're just now entering section four.</i>

58:33.859 --> 58:35.526
Hold your fire. Hold your fire.

58:35.527 --> 58:37.762
- Good way to get killed.
- I need that cell open.

58:37.763 --> 58:40.331
- We're moving the prisoner.
- Those are not my orders.

58:40.332 --> 58:42.582
- Mika! Get out of here!
- Not without you!

58:43.702 --> 58:45.576
Then we all die together.

59:04.089 --> 59:06.202
Open fire! Multiple targets!

59:19.538 --> 59:21.906
- Open that gate.
- I can't do that.

59:23.142 --> 59:24.516
Go to infrared, boys.

59:25.411 --> 59:27.285
They're already in the room.

59:34.787 --> 59:36.331
Open fire!

59:37.222 --> 59:39.767
We're under attack! Unknown number!

59:49.702 --> 59:51.519
Shit.

01:00:00.546 --> 01:00:02.513
Oh, Mika, Mika.

01:00:02.514 --> 01:00:03.853
Shh.

01:00:05.718 --> 01:00:07.501
I like you more and more.

01:00:08.420 --> 01:00:11.034
Okay, all right.

01:00:14.293 --> 01:00:16.042
Shit.

01:00:19.932 --> 01:00:22.876
- Mika, hurry.
- Okay.

01:00:25.137 --> 01:00:27.105
Mika, I don't wanna sound critical...

01:00:27.106 --> 01:00:29.720
Look, I'm doing the best I can here.

01:00:32.211 --> 01:00:35.655
- We don't have much time!
- Shit!

01:00:41.320 --> 01:00:43.035
Let's go.

01:00:57.836 --> 01:00:59.210
Oh, God.

01:01:00.339 --> 01:01:03.055
We are heavily
engaged with the enemy, I repea...

01:01:07.446 --> 01:01:08.820
Wait here.

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:46.529
Let's go.

01:01:50.255 --> 01:01:52.004
We got two men over on the side!

01:01:54.159 --> 01:01:56.194
Get down, get down!

01:01:56.195 --> 01:01:58.172
Look out!

01:02:19.618 --> 01:02:22.198
The car's upstairs. Go.

01:02:23.388 --> 01:02:26.673
- Go now.
- Okay.

01:02:30.395 --> 01:02:32.063
Murderer.

01:02:32.064 --> 01:02:34.999
Traitor. So long, brother.

01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:40.638
Vengeance, betrayal
begets blood, brother. Murderer.

01:02:40.639 --> 01:02:45.076
Death. Kill. Murderer.
Kill him. Just. Vengeance.

01:02:48.080 --> 01:02:49.488
Little brother.

01:04:54.039 --> 01:04:55.981
Come on, Raizo.

01:06:04.309 --> 01:06:06.718
Raizo, where are you?

01:06:13.652 --> 01:06:15.264
Shit.

01:06:17.856 --> 01:06:19.230
Ah!

01:06:23.628 --> 01:06:25.309
Fuck!

01:06:26.732 --> 01:06:29.516
Shit. Oh, my God. Okay.

01:06:32.037 --> 01:06:33.752
Okay.

01:06:38.143 --> 01:06:40.290
Oh, my God!

01:07:51.550 --> 01:07:53.731
Come on!

01:07:58.557 --> 01:08:00.602
Watch it! Help!

01:08:37.496 --> 01:08:39.837
Ah!

01:08:58.750 --> 01:09:01.432
Goodbye, little brother.

01:09:02.888 --> 01:09:04.966
Get in!

01:09:18.136 --> 01:09:19.953
I can't believe I found you.

01:09:20.305 --> 01:09:22.384
I was waiting for you.

01:09:31.049 --> 01:09:33.867
- Ugh!
- Oh, God.

01:09:34.219 --> 01:09:37.002
I have to get you to a hospital.

01:09:37.122 --> 01:09:39.372
No. Not a hospital.

01:09:40.457 --> 01:09:43.072
Just keep moving.

01:09:45.764 --> 01:09:48.631
<i>- Mika, where are you?
- He told me to keep moving.</i>

01:09:48.633 --> 01:09:50.968
<i>- Is he still alive?
- After a fashion.</i>

01:09:50.969 --> 01:09:53.703
Jesus Christ.
Listen, I'm gonna bring you in.

01:09:53.705 --> 01:09:56.840
<i>- No, not this time.
- There are too many people involved.</i>

01:09:56.841 --> 01:10:00.058
- It's just a matter of time.
- I don't think we have much time.

01:10:00.812 --> 01:10:02.595
Mika.

01:10:02.781 --> 01:10:04.155
Shit.

01:10:48.893 --> 01:10:51.643
I know you can't hear me...

01:10:51.963 --> 01:10:55.544
so I'm sure this doesn't matter...

01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:58.211
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

01:11:00.572 --> 01:11:03.914
I'm just a forensic researcher.

01:11:05.410 --> 01:11:10.163
It's like a fancy way of saying
I'm a librarian.

01:11:12.851 --> 01:11:15.635
By myself, I can't do anything
to help you.

01:11:19.324 --> 01:11:22.666
I wanted to thank you
for saving my life.

01:11:34.339 --> 01:11:37.487
And I hope you can forgive me
for this.

01:11:38.243 --> 01:11:40.411
- Agent Maslow! The tracking device.
- Yeah?

01:11:40.412 --> 01:11:43.526
- You got a lock?
- Triangulating her position now.

01:11:43.581 --> 01:11:45.767
Alright, I want the
International Task Force mobilized...

01:11:45.768 --> 01:11:47.867
and ready to go in 5 minutes.

01:12:02.300 --> 01:12:03.834
At last.

01:12:03.835 --> 01:12:05.469
Kill him.

01:12:05.470 --> 01:12:06.837
Slit his throat.

01:12:06.838 --> 01:12:08.172
No.

01:12:08.173 --> 01:12:11.822
Our father should have the honor.

01:12:12.277 --> 01:12:15.312
- Take him to Father.
- Bring him to Father.

01:12:31.730 --> 01:12:33.911
- Clear.
- Clear.

01:12:43.274 --> 01:12:45.888
They took him 10 minutes ago.

01:12:46.845 --> 01:12:48.958
He's gone.

01:13:16.674 --> 01:13:19.891
<i>You are Ozunu.</i>

01:13:21.045 --> 01:13:25.764
<i>You are part of me,
as I am part of you.</i>

01:13:26.551 --> 01:13:30.268
<i>This is the truth of your lives.</i>

01:13:31.422 --> 01:13:36.209
<i>And it will remain true after death.</i>

01:14:24.576 --> 01:14:27.486
My child.

01:14:28.413 --> 01:14:31.857
It is good to see you again.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:40.204
Do you know there was a time...

01:14:41.092 --> 01:14:43.994
when I looked at you...

01:14:43.995 --> 01:14:46.279
I felt such pride.

01:14:48.266 --> 01:14:52.746
No child ever showed more promise.

01:14:54.205 --> 01:14:57.641
You are the son I was waiting for...

01:14:57.642 --> 01:14:59.960
the one to take my place.

01:15:03.982 --> 01:15:09.599
And now, do you know
what you have done?

01:15:09.621 --> 01:15:14.024
How you have shamed my family?

01:15:14.025 --> 01:15:17.242
How you have hurt me?

01:15:20.899 --> 01:15:23.683
Why do you think I did it?

01:15:28.573 --> 01:15:30.652
Get this thing...

01:15:31.342 --> 01:15:33.057
out of my sight.

01:15:44.088 --> 01:15:48.738
Tonight we avenge
our brothers and sisters.

01:15:50.528 --> 01:15:54.336
Tonight we avenge our honor.

01:15:56.801 --> 01:16:03.112
Let this death be remembered
for a thousand years.

01:16:13.518 --> 01:16:16.359
Weakness compels strength.

01:16:21.659 --> 01:16:25.162
Betrayal begets blood.

01:16:25.163 --> 01:16:28.175
Ah!

01:16:32.770 --> 01:16:35.179
You are getting weak...

01:16:35.807 --> 01:16:37.818
old man.

01:16:38.443 --> 01:16:41.023
Ah!

01:16:55.259 --> 01:16:56.633
Father!

01:17:13.911 --> 01:17:15.387
Move it!

01:17:33.064 --> 01:17:34.438
Shit!

01:17:38.970 --> 01:17:42.084
- What took you?
- You knew I'd come?

01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:45.375
Just because I was asleep
doesn't mean I couldn't hear you.

01:17:45.376 --> 01:17:47.660
And I forgive you.

01:17:48.846 --> 01:17:50.754
Mika!

01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:57.594
Come, this way.

01:18:17.041 --> 01:18:19.009
You swore to me
you'd stay inside the APC.

01:18:19.010 --> 01:18:22.056
- I thought we were too late.
- First team is ready, sir!

01:18:22.547 --> 01:18:24.797
- Hit it!
- Go!

01:18:32.023 --> 01:18:33.397
Stay here.

01:18:48.706 --> 01:18:50.080
You two, with me!

01:19:14.398 --> 01:19:16.433
Come, little brother.

01:19:16.434 --> 01:19:19.480
Let us play like old times.

01:19:30.047 --> 01:19:31.921
Ah!

01:19:38.890 --> 01:19:40.605
Ah!

01:20:01.279 --> 01:20:03.494
Ah!

01:20:06.117 --> 01:20:07.491
My turn.

01:20:07.919 --> 01:20:10.100
Watch the roof!

01:21:05.610 --> 01:21:07.518
Do you still think about her?

01:21:08.913 --> 01:21:12.198
Do you remember the sound she made
when I stuck her?

01:21:13.751 --> 01:21:15.159
Ah!

01:21:34.872 --> 01:21:36.689
Ugh!

01:21:43.681 --> 01:21:45.760
Ah!

01:21:46.183 --> 01:21:47.864
Ah!

01:21:53.291 --> 01:21:54.491
Watch the roof!

01:21:54.492 --> 01:21:59.040
3 o'clock! I need a solid
perimeter on the left, now!

01:22:18.015 --> 01:22:20.663
You remember...

01:22:21.052 --> 01:22:22.892
all I taught you.

01:22:39.437 --> 01:22:43.450
You are still Ozunu.

01:22:52.216 --> 01:22:57.299
Come. Beg your father for forgiveness.

01:23:06.864 --> 01:23:08.681
Ah!

01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:26.599
Your heart is weak.

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:54.890
Raizo!

01:24:28.579 --> 01:24:32.763
All this loss, this waste...

01:24:33.551 --> 01:24:38.235
because you put yourself
before your family.

01:24:39.924 --> 01:24:42.936
This is not my family.

01:24:45.463 --> 01:24:48.281
You are not my father.

01:24:48.632 --> 01:24:51.601
And the breath I take after I kill you...

01:24:51.602 --> 01:24:54.216
will be the first breath of my life.

01:26:04.375 --> 01:26:05.783
Ah!

01:26:19.089 --> 01:26:22.692
- Mika, run!
- Where is he?

01:26:22.693 --> 01:26:24.260
Where is he?

01:26:24.261 --> 01:26:26.340
Get away!

01:26:26.463 --> 01:26:28.337
Mika!

01:26:29.166 --> 01:26:31.074
No!

01:26:36.206 --> 01:26:38.524
Most children are disappointments...

01:26:39.043 --> 01:26:42.487
not worth the effort to raise.

01:27:23.287 --> 01:27:25.002
Ah!

01:27:59.323 --> 01:28:01.231
Mika.

01:28:27.885 --> 01:28:29.919
Jesus Christ, what happened?

01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:31.931
She saved my life.

01:28:34.558 --> 01:28:35.966
Medic!

01:28:37.494 --> 01:28:39.402
Medic!

01:28:44.435 --> 01:28:46.912
She'll be all right.

01:28:47.705 --> 01:28:49.784
Her heart is special.

01:28:51.508 --> 01:28:53.826
I need a medic here now!

01:29:00.718 --> 01:29:03.468
- Is she gonna be all right?
- I don't understand.

01:29:04.321 --> 01:29:06.756
She's got a hole
right through her heart, but...

01:29:06.757 --> 01:29:09.439
My heart is over here.

01:30:07.050 --> 01:30:08.867
Come with me.
