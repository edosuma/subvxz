she said that she was 90% sure

34:53.325 --> 34:54.825
[radio chatter]

34:54.827 --> 34:57.527
This was one
of those moments in this

34:57.529 --> 34:58.728
where we got lucky.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.500
<i> There is a very tall curb</i>

35:03.502 --> 35:06.136
<i> between the Bank of Colorad</i>

35:06.205 --> 35:07.704

35:07.706 --> 35:10.240
<i> As the semi leaves the stree</i>

35:10.342 --> 35:11.842
<i> he hits that curb.</i>

35:15.013 --> 35:17.180
I'm hearing pop, pop,

35:17.182 --> 35:20.217
like, two very distinct pops.

35:21.820 --> 35:24.721
<i> My first instinct was,</i>
<i> "Ooh, did he just</i>
<i> shoot at me?"</i>

35:24.723 --> 35:26.923
<i> And then, my next thought wa</i>

35:26.925 --> 35:28.358
"He just popped his tires."

35:29.928 --> 35:32.562
<i> Both front tires on that tru</i>
<i> were deflated.</i>

35:32.631 --> 35:36.900
<i> His speeds go from 55,</i>
<i> 75 miles per hour</i>

35:36.902 --> 35:39.202

35:49.014 --> 35:50.413
<i> It's taking out power poles</i>

35:51.016 --> 35:52.281
<i> It's hitting cars.</i>

35:53.919 --> 35:56.753
He makes a left-hand turn
and hits another car head on.

36:00.325 --> 36:04.728
<i> If this truck decides</i>
<i> to just plow into a house,</i>

36:04.730 --> 36:09.299
the potential
for mass casualties is huge.

36:15.107 --> 36:16.606
[Griggs] <i> I realize</i>
<i> that every time</i>

36:16.608 --> 36:18.742
<i> he makes a left-hand turn,</i>

36:18.810 --> 36:23.046
<i> the driver's door of the tru</i>
<i> is fully exposed.</i>

36:23.048 --> 36:25.415
<i> He's literally presenting m</i>
<i> a target.</i>

36:25.417 --> 36:29.019
<i> If I can just wait for him</i>
<i> to make a left-hand turn,</i>

36:29.021 --> 36:30.854
<i> I can take out this threat.</i>

36:30.923 --> 36:33.456
<i> My first instinct was</i>
<i> to reach for my rifle.</i>

36:33.558 --> 36:37.527
<i> However, my rifle has falle</i>

36:37.529 --> 36:39.329

36:51.710 --> 36:55.912

[gun firing]

37:02.688 --> 37:05.222
The problem was
I came in a little bit low.

37:06.592 --> 37:10.560
<i> He makes a few more turns</i>

37:10.662 --> 37:17.300

37:17.302 --> 37:22.706
[radio chatter]

37:22.708 --> 37:28.211
Plain as day, I saw him
jump out the driver's door
of that truck.

37:30.949 --> 37:33.116
<i> And I call out on the radio.</i>

37:51.203 --> 37:53.603
[Rockwell] <i> Time I rolled up</i>
<i> on scene and the time</i>
<i> I got out of my vehicle,</i>

37:53.605 --> 37:56.840
it was unsure if he was still
in the semi or if he ran.

37:59.811 --> 38:01.478
<i> It was chaotic.</i>

38:01.480 --> 38:04.247
<i> There was people talking,</i>

38:40.519 --> 38:42.319
[Rockwell]

38:48.527 --> 38:50.527
Some of the residents
came outside that house

38:50.529 --> 38:53.963
and said he was inside
trying to get a firearm.

38:53.999 --> 38:56.933
<i> At that point, I thought</i>
<i> it was gonna be</i>
<i> a hostage situation</i>

38:56.935 --> 38:59.502
<i> where he was gonna barricad</i>

39:04.142 --> 39:05.842
<i> My worst fear at that time</i>

39:05.911 --> 39:07.811
is it was gonna be
essentially a shootout.

[officer shouting]

39:36.608 --> 39:38.808

39:41.713 --> 39:44.314
I heard Deputy Berlanga
calling out

39:44.316 --> 39:46.349
and, you know,
having someone at gunpoint.
