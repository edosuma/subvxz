<b>- Were you guys unanimous</b>
<b>on that?</b>

37:32.513 --> 37:33.513
<b>- No.</b>
<b>- No.</b>

37:33.514 --> 37:34.981
<b>With Boneface's,</b>

37:34.982 --> 37:36.416
<b> <i>it was artistically crippled</i> </b>

37:36.417 --> 37:38.218
<b> <i>before it even became a tattoo.</i> </b>

37:38.219 --> 37:41.888
<b>- I don't think Boneface should</b>
<b>be in this competition at all,</b>

37:41.889 --> 37:44.024
<b>especially after today</b>

37:44.025 --> 37:47.627
<b>and how he conducted himself</b>
<b>as an artist and as a man.</b>

37:47.628 --> 37:49.729
<b>- I feel like people</b>
<b>are using critiques</b>

37:49.730 --> 37:51.531
<b>to hide behind personal issues.</b>

37:51.532 --> 37:53.834
<b>When I was down here earlier,</b>
<b>she spoke her piece down here.</b>

37:53.835 --> 37:55.735
<b>Fine, but I'm not gonna</b>
<b>allow you to snowball me.</b>

37:55.736 --> 37:57.003
<b>I'm gonna lash back.</b>

37:57.004 --> 37:58.471
<b>Don't make it personal</b>
<b>to attack me.</b>

37:58.472 --> 37:59.773
<b>- Yours was worse than theirs.</b>
<b>And when I lash back...</b>

37:59.774 --> 38:00.774
<b>that's your opinion.</b>

38:00.775 --> 38:01.775
<b>Everybody else voted for her,</b>

38:01.776 --> 38:03.176
<b>so obviously it wasn't.</b>

38:03.177 --> 38:05.745
<b>- His best tattoos are on par</b>
<b>with my worst day.</b>

38:05.746 --> 38:07.881
<b>- She hasn't done a clean tattoo</b>
<b>since she's been here.</b>

38:07.882 --> 38:08.982
<b>- That is not true.</b>

38:08.983 --> 38:10.417
<b>- I see both sides of the coin.</b>

38:10.418 --> 38:12.953
<b>I personally like Gia's tattoo.</b>

38:12.954 --> 38:15.422
<b> <i>It's a creative idea,</i> </b>
<b> <i>definitely hit contrast,</i> </b>

38:15.423 --> 38:17.757
<b>but it's riddled</b>
<b>with technical difficulties.</b>

38:17.758 --> 38:20.293
<b>- And this is not the first time</b>
<b>that she does a rough tattoo.</b>

38:20.294 --> 38:22.562
<b>She did that peacock</b>
<b>where she was out of the sides</b>

38:22.563 --> 38:24.731
<b>and colored out of the lines</b>
<b>and went crazy.</b>

38:24.732 --> 38:27.133
<b>I can't forget that.</b>
<b>And then you have Matt's tattoo.</b>

38:27.134 --> 38:28.735
<b>Haven't even touched</b>
<b>on that yet.</b>

38:28.736 --> 38:30.370
<b> <i>It's a circle with a weird</i> </b>
<b> <i>shape around it</i> </b>

38:30.371 --> 38:31.905
<b> <i>in rainbow colors.</i> </b>

38:31.906 --> 38:34.474
<b>- Honestly, I feel like we've</b>
<b>all been so distracted</b>

38:34.475 --> 38:35.976
<b>with Boneface's and Gia's</b>

38:35.977 --> 38:38.178
<b>that I kind of took Matt</b>
<b>out of the equation,</b>

38:38.179 --> 38:39.746
<b>'cause I was like, "He's lacking</b>"

38:39.747 --> 38:41.281
<b>in both departments</b>
<b>that they are."</b>

38:41.282 --> 38:42.549
<b>- And I knew you guys didn't</b>
<b>want to see any more,</b>

38:42.550 --> 38:44.384
<b> <i>like, dark, creepy kind of</i> </b>
<b> <i>stuff from me,</i> </b>

38:44.385 --> 38:46.753
<b>so I have been trying</b>
<b>to push myself</b>

38:46.754 --> 38:48.522
<b>to show you guys</b>
<b>I can do something different.</b>

38:48.523 --> 38:50.157
<b>- This is the toughest room</b>
<b>to come in</b>

38:50.158 --> 38:51.591
<b>if you're not ready</b>
<b>for everything.</b>

38:51.592 --> 38:53.126
<b>- Right.</b>
<b>- You could be a new-school guy</b>

38:53.127 --> 38:54.694
<b>or a Japanese guy</b>
<b>or a traditional guy.</b>

38:54.695 --> 38:55.929
<b>That doesn't mean anything.</b>

38:55.930 --> 38:57.864
<b>If we can only see</b>
<b>one dimension,</b>

38:57.865 --> 39:00.167
<b>then you're not giving us</b>
<b>a choice.</b>

39:00.168 --> 39:02.602
<b>Overall, three weird tattoos</b>
<b>up here today.</b>

39:02.603 --> 39:05.438
<b>I think that Boneface</b>
<b>had the worst drawing on paper,</b>

39:05.439 --> 39:08.275
<b> <i>but if you just look</i> </b>
<b> <i>at the one single red planet</i> </b>

39:08.276 --> 39:09.709
<b> <i>in the center,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the roundness of it,</i> </b>

39:09.710 --> 39:11.545
<b> <i>the crispness of it,</i> </b>
<b> <i>the textures in it,</i> </b>

39:11.546 --> 39:13.313
<b>just that little bit</b>
<b>of tattoo in there</b>

39:13.314 --> 39:15.815
<b>looks better than the moon</b>
<b>in Matt's tattoo.</b>

39:15.816 --> 39:17.050
<b>- [exhales]</b>

39:17.051 --> 39:18.385
<b>- All right,</b>
<b>who's going home here?</b>

39:18.386 --> 39:21.454
<b>- The tattoo I like the least</b>
<b>is Matt's.</b>

39:21.455 --> 39:23.824
<b>- Gia, I like where you're</b>
<b>coming from creatively,</b>

39:23.825 --> 39:25.258
<b>but it looks messy to me.</b>

39:25.259 --> 39:27.194
<b>My vote is for Gia.</b>

39:27.195 --> 39:29.830
<b>- Well, for me, I want to see</b>
<b>the best tattooer move forward</b>

39:29.831 --> 39:32.299
<b>that can have the most to offer</b>
<b>in the next challenge.</b>

39:32.300 --> 39:34.534
<b>I feel like Gia's artistic,</b>
<b>creative ability</b>

39:34.535 --> 39:36.369
<b>could definitely shine</b>
<b>in the next challenge.</b>

39:36.370 --> 39:39.139
<b>Boneface, you've done</b>
<b>some technical, solid stuff.</b>

39:39.140 --> 39:42.175
<b>Matt, I feel like we've seen a</b>
<b>few different things from you,</b>

39:42.176 --> 39:43.877
<b>and I don't know what to expect</b>
<b>going forward</b>

39:43.878 --> 39:45.345
<b>in this competition.</b>
<b>- I can definitely do better</b>

39:45.346 --> 39:47.047
<b>than what I've showed you</b>
<b>so far.</b>

39:47.048 --> 39:49.216
<b>- I'm sorry, Matt.</b>
<b>My vote's for you.</b>

39:49.217 --> 39:50.717
<b>- The judges have decided.</b>

39:50.718 --> 39:54.921
<b>Matt, you do not have</b>
<b>what it takes to be Ink Master.</b>

39:54.922 --> 39:56.590
<b>- Matt, I just don't think</b>
<b>you've shown us</b>

39:56.591 --> 39:58.091
<b>enough versatility,</b>

39:58.092 --> 40:00.694
<b>and it limits what you're able</b>
<b>to really produce.</b>

40:00.695 --> 40:01.995
<b>- Okay.</b>
<b>- All right, Matt.</b>

40:01.996 --> 40:04.231
<b>Please pack your machines</b>
<b>and close shop.</b>

40:04.232 --> 40:05.333
<b>- Thanks.</b>

40:07.702 --> 40:09.035
<b> <i>I'm bummed out to go home.</i> </b>

40:09.036 --> 40:10.837
<b>I was trying to push myself</b>
<b>outside my comfort zone,</b>

40:10.838 --> 40:12.272
<b>and instead of doing that, I</b>
<b>should've just</b>

40:12.273 --> 40:13.707
<b>done my own thing,</b>
<b>Then I'd probably</b>

40:13.708 --> 40:15.141
<b>still be in the competition.</b>

40:15.142 --> 40:20.714
<b> <i>♪</i> </b>

40:20.715 --> 40:23.083
<b> <i>announcer: On the next</b>
<b>episode of "Ink Master"...</i> </b>

40:23.084 --> 40:25.619
<b>- Your canvases today...</b>

40:25.620 --> 40:29.023
<b>have permanent scars.</b>

40:30.324 --> 40:31.725
<b> <i>- That is super scary.</i> </b>

40:31.726 --> 40:34.227
<b>I do not want to be responsible</b>
<b>for [bleep] that up.</b>

40:34.228 --> 40:37.297
<b>- [groaning]</b>

40:37.298 --> 40:38.832
<b>- We're past the point</b>
<b>of having people</b>

40:38.833 --> 40:40.901
<b> <i>that don't know</i> </b>
<b> <i>how to tattoo at all.</i> </b>

40:40.902 --> 40:42.736
<b>- I thought they send</b>
<b>ugly tattoos home.</b>

40:42.737 --> 40:44.471
<b>- I like it. No matter what...</b>
<b>- Ugly is ugly.</b>

40:44.472 --> 40:45.739
<b>- Don't tell me [bleep].</b>
<b>You don't know...</b>

40:45.740 --> 40:46.740
<b>- Shh.</b>

40:46.741 --> 40:48.175
<b>- Nikki's literally fuming.</b>

40:48.176 --> 40:49.442
<b>- This chick's 24 years old,</b>

40:49.443 --> 40:51.311
<b>walking around telling us</b>
<b>how to tattoo.</b>

40:51.312 --> 40:54.115
<b>I say we steamroll her.</b>
