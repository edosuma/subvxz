00:01.000 --> 00:02.000
Hmm...where is he?

00:03.000 --> 00:07.000
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

00:09.000 --> 00:11.000
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

00:12.000 --> 00:14.000
# Sarah and Duck. #
Quack!

00:17.000 --> 00:22.000
It's nearly time for bed, and Sarah
and Duck are looking for Moon,

00:22.000 --> 00:24.000
to ask him for a bedtime story.

00:24.000 --> 00:27.000
Hmm...where is he?

00:27.000 --> 00:30.000
Quack, quack.

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
Oh! Hello, Mars. Have you seen Moon?

00:33.000 --> 00:38.000
Hello. Can't say that I have.
Probably just running late.

00:38.000 --> 00:41.000
Got caught up in one
of his...paintings.

00:41.000 --> 00:45.000
Hmm. Well, I'll just have
to fill in for him, won't I?

00:45.000 --> 00:48.000
Can't be much to this moon business!

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Erm...are you sure?

00:50.000 --> 00:53.000
Hm! How hard can it be?
MARS CHUCKLES

00:53.000 --> 00:56.000
Well, doesn't seem a story is
needed.

00:56.000 --> 00:58.000
Perhaps it's time for bed.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
SHE GRUNTS
Night, Mars.

01:04.000 --> 01:06.000
Nighty-night!

01:08.000 --> 01:10.000
Night, Duck. Quack.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
SHE YAWNS

01:17.000 --> 01:19.000
Sleep tight.

01:19.000 --> 01:21.000
Sleep...tight.

01:24.000 --> 01:27.000
# Hello to you, my bushy moustache

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
# I'd like to give you a twirl

01:29.000 --> 01:32.000
# I'd like to give you a tweak

01:32.000 --> 01:35.000
# You're fluffy and itchy
and tickle my cheeks. #

01:35.000 --> 01:36.000
Ho-ho-ho!
SARAH GROANS

01:36.000 --> 01:39.000
You are a lovely moustache. Hey-hey!

01:40.000 --> 01:46.000
Excuse me, Mars.
We're trying...to...sleep.

01:46.000 --> 01:48.000
Ah, well! Good luck with that.

01:48.000 --> 01:50.000
Eh?
No...

01:50.000 --> 01:55.000
I think Sarah means it's difficult
to get to sleep with you singing.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.000
Oh! Ha-ha! I see.
I promise I won't sing any more.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.000
ZIP

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Thank you, Mars.

02:04.000 --> 02:06.000
SHE YAWNS

02:11.000 --> 02:13.000
MARACAS SHAKING

02:13.000 --> 02:15.000
SARAH GROANS

02:15.000 --> 02:17.000
That sounds like...

02:17.000 --> 02:19.000
MARACAS SHAKING

02:19.000 --> 02:20.000
NARRATOR CLEARS THROAT

02:24.000 --> 02:28.000
Hello again. I thought
you were sleeping.

02:28.000 --> 02:30.000
We were trying our best.

02:30.000 --> 02:33.000
Your maracas are loud.

02:33.000 --> 02:34.000
Quack, quack.

02:34.000 --> 02:37.000
But, a...a planet needs to practise.

02:37.000 --> 02:41.000
Er...doesn't sound to me
like you NEED any practise.

02:41.000 --> 02:44.000
MARACAS SHAKE
You're right! Ha-ha!

02:44.000 --> 02:48.000
Still the best maracas minstrel
in the galaxy.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
SHE SIGHS
Thank goodness.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.000
SHE GIGGLES

02:57.000 --> 02:59.000
Sleepy duck.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.000
Goodnight, you t...
KNOCKING AT WINDOW

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
Erm, excuse me?
SARAH GROANS

03:05.000 --> 03:07.000
Erm...hello?

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
Ooh!

03:09.000 --> 03:12.000
So. Ha-ha!
What am I supposed to be doing?

03:12.000 --> 03:15.000
Hmm.
Good point.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
What DOES Moon do?

03:17.000 --> 03:22.000
He stays quite still and quiet.

03:22.000 --> 03:23.000
True.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.000
Oh, and he makes a nice,
gentle light.

03:26.000 --> 03:29.000
So, how do you do that?

03:29.000 --> 03:33.000
SHE YAWNS
We can help you practice.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
Oh, that would be marvellous!

03:41.000 --> 03:43.000
Righty-o, where should we start?

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Maybe your glow?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.000
Ah, yes. How's this?

03:48.000 --> 03:51.000
Quack! Ah! Wrong way!

03:51.000 --> 03:52.000
Less!

03:52.000 --> 03:53.000
Oh, right.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.000
Less. Um... Bit less.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.000
Huh. Why would anyone
want to be this dim?

04:03.000 --> 04:06.000
Hmm...good.

04:06.000 --> 04:07.000
Ha! What's next?

04:07.000 --> 04:10.000
Being quiet, perhaps?

04:10.000 --> 04:14.000
If you need to talk,
you can whisper.

04:14.000 --> 04:16.000
A whis-per.

04:17.000 --> 04:19.000
Like this.

04:19.000 --> 04:22.000
WHISPERED:
Do you want some bread, Duck?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.000
Quack!

04:23.000 --> 04:24.000
Now you try.

04:24.000 --> 04:26.000
Hmm. Er...

04:26.000 --> 04:30.000
DO YOU WANT SOME BREAD, DUCK?

04:30.000 --> 04:31.000
Quack!

04:31.000 --> 04:37.000
Mmh. Not bad... Try again.

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Perhaps less raspy.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.000
Right. Um...

04:40.000 --> 04:43.000
WHISPERED:
Do you want some bread, Duck?

04:43.000 --> 04:45.000
Quack!

04:45.000 --> 04:47.000
Mmh. Good.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.000
Quack.

04:48.000 --> 04:49.000
Quack, quack.

04:49.000 --> 04:52.000
Pluto's tail, I've got it!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
What's next?

04:54.000 --> 04:57.000
Um...staying still.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Quack, quack.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.000
Ah! Freeze! Oh!

05:05.000 --> 05:08.000
HE STUTTERS

05:08.000 --> 05:09.000
Bibbleflops!

05:11.000 --> 05:14.000
Ahem, bibblefloppy? Yeah, erm, yes.

05:14.000 --> 05:19.000
Eh, bibbleflops. That is to say,
I'm filling in for Moon.

05:19.000 --> 05:22.000
The rascal hasn't turned
up for work, you see.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.000
But it's harder than it looks.

05:24.000 --> 05:29.000
I see. Well, Moon usually takes
the bus to work on a Tuesday.

05:29.000 --> 05:31.000
Maybe they got stuck in traffic?

05:31.000 --> 05:33.000
Oh! Bus stop!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.000
SHE GASPS

05:39.000 --> 05:42.000
I think we've found
our missing Moon.

05:42.000 --> 05:43.000
Uh-huh.

05:43.000 --> 05:46.000
MOON SNORES
What's going on here, then?

05:46.000 --> 05:49.000
Oh, I've tried everything
to wake him up.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.000
He's a deep sleeper, this one.

05:51.000 --> 05:55.000
What he needs is someone loud.

05:55.000 --> 06:00.000
Oh, yes. Ha-ha!
This is something I CAN do well!

06:00.000 --> 06:02.000
MOON SNORES

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
RISE AND SHINE, OLD BEAN!

06:05.000 --> 06:06.000
Hello, sleepyhead.

06:08.000 --> 06:11.000
Oh, dear.
I must have drifted off. Um...

06:11.000 --> 06:13.000
What time is it?

06:13.000 --> 06:15.000
Time you were at work, dear.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
DUCK SNORES

06:21.000 --> 06:24.000
Goodness. Yes, of course.

06:24.000 --> 06:26.000
MOON GROANS

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Thank you, driver.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Righto.

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
Night-night, everyone.

06:31.000 --> 06:34.000
Oh! Am I relieved of my duties,
then?

06:34.000 --> 06:36.000
Uh-huh.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.000
Well! Thank heavens for that,
eh? Ha-ha!

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:50.000 --> 06:52.000
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:54.000 --> 06:56.000
# Sarah and Duck
Quack!

06:58.000 --> 06:59.000
# Sarah and Duck. #
Quack!
