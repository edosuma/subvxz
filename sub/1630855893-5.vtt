WEBVTT

00:08.800 --> 00:11.011
Three-quarter power building
to full in two.

00:16.265 --> 00:17.476
Full power.

00:20.729 --> 00:23.232
Unlike other Tupperware parties
you may have attended,

00:23.232 --> 00:25.901
I give thorough product descriptions
and I also make my own snacks.

00:28.445 --> 00:31.657
This Tuesday's menu
will be freshly squeezed nectarine juice

00:31.657 --> 00:34.368
along with lemon-lime bars
on a graham-cracker crust.

00:34.368 --> 00:36.203
Excellent. See you then.

02:15.260 --> 02:16.512
What about this one?

02:17.888 --> 02:19.640
"Butylated hydroxytoluene."

02:20.641 --> 02:24.520
A good rule of thumb is not to eat foods
that share ingredients with jet fuel.

02:25.020 --> 02:26.980
I'll add it to my vocab list.

02:30.067 --> 02:31.818
What color were Dad's eyes?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.738
Blue, like yours.
You know how recessive genes work.

02:34.738 --> 02:36.240
What color was his hair?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.368
Brown.
Where are these questions coming from?

02:40.035 --> 02:42.621
Mrs. Mudford is making us
fill out a family tree,

02:42.621 --> 02:44.831
and I know nothing about Dad.

02:44.831 --> 02:47.084
- You know about your dad.
- No, I don't.

02:47.084 --> 02:50.420
Yes, you do. You know
that he was a brilliant scientist,

02:50.420 --> 02:51.713
that he was kind,

02:51.713 --> 02:53.257
a very funny dancer

02:53.924 --> 02:56.301
and my favorite person
in the world until I met you.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.641
Well, what about his parents?
I need to put them on the tree too.

03:03.141 --> 03:05.394
Your grandparents died in a car accident
when he was young,

03:05.394 --> 03:06.812
then he went to live in a boys' home.

03:07.479 --> 03:09.273
What about your parents?

03:09.273 --> 03:12.442
Ezra and Iris.
We moved around a bit. Not that exciting.

03:13.026 --> 03:14.486
So are we all alone?

03:15.863 --> 03:17.656
We are the opposite of alone.

03:17.656 --> 03:19.950
We have each other, we have Six Thirty,

03:19.950 --> 03:23.120
and we have a huge family waiting
at home for us for dinner.

03:23.620 --> 03:26.498
But you are the chef, so you tell me.
What do you need?

03:27.583 --> 03:30.586
I'll get the flour.
You go to the butcher counter.

03:30.586 --> 03:33.297
- Copy.
- But nothing too lean.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.965
Of course.

03:39.636 --> 03:41.555
- I want a gumball!
- Stop it!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.557
- Get back here!
- I wanna go on the horsey!

03:43.557 --> 03:45.642
- Off of the horse!
- Is everything okay?

03:45.642 --> 03:49.938
Yes. I am so sorry for my little terrors.

03:49.938 --> 03:52.900
- It is quite all right. I understand.
- You know, five minutes.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.027
All I want is five minutes of quiet.

03:55.611 --> 03:56.862
Well, if I'm being greedy,

03:56.862 --> 03:59.448
I'd like them to set the table
and occasionally say thank you.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.825
But five minutes, I'd settle for that.

04:06.205 --> 04:09.374
Those boys were being so rowdy. Geez.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.376
Butylated hydroxytoluene.

04:13.212 --> 04:16.673
That man was out of his mind.
Can you imagine me hosting a TV show?

04:17.882 --> 04:20.135
Seriously? Hear TV pays well.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.388
What's the cost of selling your soul?

04:23.388 --> 04:25.307
Depends. How much they paying?

04:25.807 --> 04:27.518
I thought you sold Tupperware.

04:27.518 --> 04:30.395
I sell Tupperware
so I have time for my research.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.565
I wanna be an actor. Like on <i>Gunsmoke.</i>

04:34.191 --> 04:36.610
You wanna be a lawyer like your mother.

04:36.610 --> 04:38.695
Or, if things don't work out,
a doctor like your father.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.241
You need more milk.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.993
You're lucky you have a father.

04:46.370 --> 04:47.913
You have a father too, bunny.

04:47.913 --> 04:49.623
He's looking down on you right now.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.251
I know. I was just being provocative.

04:52.751 --> 04:54.545
Excuse me, Miss Zott,

04:54.545 --> 04:58.131
but what is this unopened letter from
Phillips Laboratory doing on your counter?

04:58.131 --> 05:02.219
The same Phillips that has called you back
for not one, but two follow-up interviews?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.888
I prefer rejection after my meal.

05:04.888 --> 05:08.183
Would you like me to preview it for you?
I have an excellent poker face.

05:08.684 --> 05:09.977
Open it!

05:09.977 --> 05:11.979
- Open it!
- Open it!

05:11.979 --> 05:15.023
- Open it! Open it!
- Okay, fine.

05:15.023 --> 05:16.191
Read away.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.530
"Dear Miss Zott,
thank you for your continued patience

05:21.530 --> 05:23.699
as we narrow our list of candidates.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.450
We are thrilled--

05:26.159 --> 05:29.705
We are thrilled to tell you
that you have reached our final round

05:29.705 --> 05:31.498
and we intend to make a decision shortly.

05:31.498 --> 05:33.709
Please provide us with references
at your earliest convenience

05:33.709 --> 05:35.377
so that we may..." Blah-blah-blah-blah.

05:35.377 --> 05:37.754
Congratulations, Elizabeth!

05:37.754 --> 05:40.465
- References.
- This is great.

05:40.465 --> 05:41.633
What's a reference?

05:41.633 --> 05:44.178
A reference is when someone you
no longer wish to work with

05:44.178 --> 05:45.554
holds the fate of your next job.

05:46.513 --> 05:49.308
Anyway, I am not getting my hopes up.

06:15.667 --> 06:17.169
I'm here to see Dr. Donatti.

06:17.169 --> 06:20.047
I don't have an appointment, but I was
hoping for the element of surprise.

06:20.756 --> 06:22.424
Dr. Donatti no longer works here.

06:23.675 --> 06:25.177
I didn't realize.

06:25.177 --> 06:27.179
Who might I speak with about possibly--

06:27.179 --> 06:28.263
Thank you.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.850
Elizabeth?

06:33.143 --> 06:34.478
Boryweitz.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.065
So what happened to Donatti?

06:38.899 --> 06:40.442
Well, you know how it goes.

06:41.068 --> 06:43.278
The board was ready for some new blood.

06:43.862 --> 06:46.240
New blood is just old blood recirculated.

06:46.740 --> 06:47.783
Fair point.

06:49.743 --> 06:52.704
I can't tell you how many times I've
wanted to reach out these past few years.

06:54.039 --> 06:55.290
You were just pacing yourself?

06:55.290 --> 06:56.875
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

06:58.752 --> 07:03.173
Yes, well, I am up for
a chemistry position at Phillips.

07:03.173 --> 07:06.844
Coming here and asking for
a recommendation is extremely unpleasant.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.555
So please be truthful and write
something befitting of my value

07:09.555 --> 07:12.850
or, alternatively, say to my face you will
be blocking my career advancements

07:12.850 --> 07:14.059
as Donatti did.

07:14.059 --> 07:15.936
I mean,
I'm sure you've received a glowing review

07:15.936 --> 07:17.813
from your current lab already.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.940
I currently sell Tupperware.

07:23.694 --> 07:25.362
I'm not going
to write you a good recommendation.

07:25.362 --> 07:26.613
I knew this was a mistake.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.866
I'm not going to do it
'cause I'd like you to come back here.

07:29.366 --> 07:31.243
Here? Are you kidding?

07:31.243 --> 07:32.786
You're an excellent chemist.

07:33.704 --> 07:36.623
And whatever you may think of Hastings,

07:36.623 --> 07:39.251
it's still the best facility
in Southern California.

07:39.251 --> 07:42.254
Far better than Phillips.
You'd be foolish not to consider it.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.674
- Chemist?
- Well, junior chemist.

07:46.258 --> 07:47.259
Which department?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.052
DNA.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.346
Between the Remsen
and my esteemed reputation,

07:51.346 --> 07:55.017
our DNA lab has become the authority
on abiogenesis research.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.227
Just dedicated men doing important work.

07:57.936 --> 08:01.398
And we'd publish together.
I'll even give you second author.

08:03.066 --> 08:04.276
Who would be first author?

08:04.276 --> 08:06.236
Well, it would be me.

08:06.236 --> 08:07.738
You?

08:07.738 --> 08:10.115
The man who stole my work
and then lied about it?

08:10.115 --> 08:14.661
I don-- I can't just put you in charge.
Second author, it-- that's not nothing.

08:14.661 --> 08:17.122
Second author is quite meaningful.

08:22.002 --> 08:23.795
So you'll consider the offer?

08:23.795 --> 08:25.255
I already have.

08:28.634 --> 08:33.972
And who do you think this is
in my family tree?

08:33.972 --> 08:35.097
Lena?

08:35.599 --> 08:36.725
The president?

08:36.725 --> 08:39.602
"Could it be the president?" And no.

08:40.979 --> 08:42.022
Amanda.

08:42.523 --> 08:43.899
Could it be Lassie?

08:43.899 --> 08:48.028
This is a family tree, not a doghouse.
We're talking about people.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.655
People are animals.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.324
No, they aren't, Madeline.
People are humans.

08:52.324 --> 08:55.494
But people are mammals,
and mammals are animals.

08:55.494 --> 08:57.704
Madeline, that's enough.

08:58.872 --> 08:59.873
Tommy?

08:59.873 --> 09:01.166
Could I be an animal?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.712
Now, stop it, Tommy. Stop it. Now--

09:05.712 --> 09:08.841
Oh, no. No, all of you, stop it!

09:08.841 --> 09:11.677
Sit down! Now!

09:12.594 --> 09:13.804
Tommy.

09:15.305 --> 09:18.058
Madeline, see me after class.

09:21.645 --> 09:25.691
- Champagne?
- Yes. Thank you.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.318
Are you joining us?

09:28.318 --> 09:30.362
Oh, no. I don't drink before lunch.

09:31.363 --> 09:32.364
Excuse me.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.079
Zott residence.

09:39.746 --> 09:40.914
Oh, for Christ's sake.

09:42.791 --> 09:47.254
She completely undermined the assignment
and said people are animals.

09:47.921 --> 09:49.464
But people are animals.

09:50.340 --> 09:52.384
Well, that's not the point, is it?

09:52.384 --> 09:55.512
Yesterday, during circle time,

09:55.512 --> 09:58.599
we were having a discussion
about Ralph's pet turtle

09:58.599 --> 10:03.770
and Madeline interrupted and said that
she was unable to find any Norman Mailer

10:03.770 --> 10:05.314
on our bookshelves.

10:05.314 --> 10:07.649
Well, she is interested
in misanthropic characters.

10:08.233 --> 10:09.318
Not surprising.

10:09.318 --> 10:12.154
Are you suggesting
that Madeline is a misanthrope?

10:12.154 --> 10:15.574
I am suggesting
that she is disruptive because--

10:16.200 --> 10:18.785
because she is not challenged here.

10:19.369 --> 10:21.288
I am suggesting
that she would be better off

10:21.288 --> 10:24.082
at a school with
a more advanced curriculum

10:24.082 --> 10:25.626
to keep her engaged.

10:25.626 --> 10:27.628
Some place like the Caswell School.

10:29.004 --> 10:30.380
I've never considered private school.

10:32.216 --> 10:35.636
Well, I think it's time you should.

10:39.389 --> 10:40.474
Thank you for your time.

10:47.606 --> 10:49.566
You do like school, don't you?

10:49.566 --> 10:51.568
Of course I don't like school.

10:52.486 --> 10:54.571
What do you mean? Why didn't you tell me?

10:54.571 --> 10:57.199
Nobody likes school. That's a fact.

10:57.199 --> 10:58.659
That is not necessarily a fact,

10:58.659 --> 11:00.536
and these are things
that you should tell me.

11:00.536 --> 11:02.371
You have enough to worry about.

11:04.790 --> 11:06.083
Amanda!

11:07.876 --> 11:09.461
Mom, can Amanda come over today?

11:09.461 --> 11:12.756
Her dad has to work late, and
we have to practice our secret language.

11:12.756 --> 11:14.132
Of course.

11:14.132 --> 11:19.346
Ank-thay yi-di-goo iss-may zi-di-got.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.723
Come on, you two.

11:30.732 --> 11:33.402
I'm not here to pitch you again.
I'm just here to pick up Amanda.

11:33.402 --> 11:34.736
And I wanted to say,

11:34.736 --> 11:36.989
the chicken pot pie
tasted even better the next day.

11:36.989 --> 11:39.408
I don't know how that's even possible.

11:39.408 --> 11:40.617
Not at all surprising.

11:40.617 --> 11:44.371
When the pie cools, the starch goes
through a process called retrogradation

11:44.371 --> 11:46.748
where the molecules restructure
into a crystalline form.

11:46.748 --> 11:48.959
The flavor compounds are trapped
in said structure,

11:48.959 --> 11:50.919
which makes every bite more flavorful.

11:51.962 --> 11:56.091
Yeah,
I definitely tasted the extra molecules.

11:57.676 --> 11:59.052
Quite delicious.

12:00.387 --> 12:01.972
Come in. I'm making dinner.

12:07.644 --> 12:09.730
I've never seen a kitchen like this.

12:09.730 --> 12:12.274
That's because it is my lab
that I also happen to cook in.

12:12.900 --> 12:14.067
The girls are in the back.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.486
They're teaching
our dog their secret language.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.323
How's Amanda been?

12:19.323 --> 12:21.533
Polite. Funny. Engaging.

12:22.034 --> 12:24.161
Although, I should tell you
she did burst into tears

12:24.161 --> 12:25.913
- when I offered her ants on a log.
- Y--

12:27.581 --> 12:29.833
My wife used to make that for her.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.294
I'm so sorry. When did she pass?

12:32.294 --> 12:34.087
Not dead. Divorced.

12:34.087 --> 12:39.760
She's just in Nevada somewhere
on a trip of spiritual enlightenment.

12:43.013 --> 12:44.389
I don't know how you do it.

12:44.389 --> 12:45.557
Do what?

12:45.557 --> 12:47.434
Keep all the balls in the air.

12:47.434 --> 12:49.811
I've been a single dad
for all of three months,

12:49.811 --> 12:53.482
and I feel like an uncoordinated octopus.

12:53.482 --> 12:56.944
Well, the best advice I ever got
is that no one is equipped to do this,

12:56.944 --> 12:58.487
and then you expand.

12:58.487 --> 13:01.323
You think you can't do it,
and then you do it anyway.

13:01.907 --> 13:05.369
I accidentally put a flask of gin
in her lunch pail last week.

13:05.369 --> 13:08.121
Well, whatever gets her
through Mrs. Mudford's class.

13:10.958 --> 13:12.960
Okay, here we go.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.421
You know,
this is why I thought you'd be a TV star.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.173
And why is that?

13:18.173 --> 13:19.925
Because you respect your audience.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.010
You don't talk down to people.

13:22.010 --> 13:26.348
You meet them where they are,
and you somehow raise them up.

13:26.348 --> 13:29.810
Well, if I were to consider it,
we'd have to be 50-50 partners.

13:29.810 --> 13:31.144
That's not how it works.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.230
Well, then it would never work,
because I won't be--

13:33.230 --> 13:34.481
No, this would be your show.

13:34.481 --> 13:37.401
You would be in charge
of virtually every aspect of it.

13:37.401 --> 13:41.405
If I do my job right,
no one will even know who I am.

13:50.706 --> 13:54.626
I am sending Mad to private school.
It's expensive.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.088
- How much would the job pay?
- More than you've ever made.

14:02.593 --> 14:06.638
My name is Walter,
and I'll be your tour guide for the day.

14:07.389 --> 14:10.142
Let's see. On your right, hair and makeup.

14:10.142 --> 14:12.477
- I can do that myself.
- No, you cannot.

14:12.477 --> 14:17.274
This is Amos, the best boy.
He is a good man.

14:17.274 --> 14:18.859
And what makes him the best?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.402
It's a job title.

14:20.402 --> 14:22.863
- And this is Matt and Robert.
- Hi.

14:22.863 --> 14:24.239
- Hello.
- Props.

14:24.239 --> 14:25.324
What kind of props?

14:25.324 --> 14:27.367
Whisks, spoons, miniature ponies,
whatever you need.

14:28.160 --> 14:32.664
And these ladies
already your biggest fans.

14:32.664 --> 14:36.376
- Shari, Nancy, Lynn and Ronni.
- Hello.

14:36.376 --> 14:38.128
So nice to meet you all.

14:38.128 --> 14:41.173
- Nice to meet you too.
- Okay. Now...

14:42.549 --> 14:44.843
- Coffee?
- Sure, how do you take it?

14:45.552 --> 14:48.180
No, sorry, I get you coffee.
That's my job.

14:49.056 --> 14:50.057
How do you take it?

14:50.849 --> 14:52.434
I'm all set. Thank you.

14:52.434 --> 14:55.771
All right. And finally...

14:58.065 --> 14:59.441
the control room.

15:00.651 --> 15:01.652
Hello.

15:01.652 --> 15:04.530
Then there's your new home.

15:05.531 --> 15:07.074
Kenny, throw 'em on.

15:19.336 --> 15:20.462
Morning, Mr. Pine.

15:21.630 --> 15:26.260
Well, we put our heads together,
came up with every woman's dream kitchen.

15:53.745 --> 15:56.665
Well? What do you think?

16:00.169 --> 16:01.461
This is revolting.

16:04.381 --> 16:06.008
Okay, let's take a five.

16:06.633 --> 16:09.094
Okay. No, I hear your concerns.

16:09.761 --> 16:13.807
Thing is, TV,
it needs to be inviting and fun.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.560
Cooking is not fun. It is vital work.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.812
Right. Okay, idea.

16:18.812 --> 16:21.857
Let's think of the show
as the world's best dinner party.

16:22.608 --> 16:24.818
- When you and Mr. Zott throw dinners--
- There is no Mr. Zott.

16:24.818 --> 16:27.321
I am unmarried. I was never married.

16:29.698 --> 16:32.576
You know what, can we--
Why don't we pick this up later?

16:36.705 --> 16:41.043
So, your-- Was Mad's father--

16:42.211 --> 16:45.047
- Was he stepping out on his wife?
- Oh, no. We were in love.

16:45.047 --> 16:46.632
We were soulmates.

16:46.632 --> 16:49.134
But he died suddenly
before I knew I was pregnant.

16:53.305 --> 16:54.681
I'm so sorry.

16:54.681 --> 16:58.101
I'm sorry for you as well,
for your divorce.

16:58.101 --> 17:00.312
Oh, no. Don't be. We weren't in love.

17:00.312 --> 17:02.022
I don't even know if she has a soul.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.565
You know what? This is what we do.

17:03.565 --> 17:08.862
Think about this whole TV thing
as like a exciting new experiment.

17:13.325 --> 17:15.117
<i>...let's meet four nice people here.</i>

17:15.117 --> 17:16.537
<i>First of all, our champion...</i>

17:19.957 --> 17:22.084
- Zott residence.
- <i>Hello, Miss Zott.</i>

17:22.084 --> 17:25.295
Just wanted to see if you and Mad wanted
to come over tomorrow for a barbecue.

17:25.295 --> 17:26.922
Mention my new marinade.

17:27.673 --> 17:30.926
Well, Mad will be there,
but I may still be studying.

17:30.926 --> 17:32.553
- <i>Studying?</i>
- TV.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.555
How does one study TV?

17:34.555 --> 17:36.223
Turn on channel 4.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.434
Yep.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.481
You got it?

17:44.481 --> 17:45.566
Got it.

17:46.775 --> 17:47.609
Okay.

17:47.609 --> 17:50.362
<i>Now, watch how often
the host smiles or laughs.</i>

17:50.362 --> 17:52.447
<i>My God, why do they smile so much?</i>

17:52.447 --> 17:54.575
There is nothing smile-worthy
about life insurance,

17:54.575 --> 17:57.327
but regardless, I am notating frequency.

17:57.327 --> 17:59.788
I'm also correlating it
with the ratings in the <i>TV Guide</i>,

17:59.788 --> 18:03.292
focusing specifically on the
coveted 24-to-35-year-old demographic.

18:03.292 --> 18:05.586
Is this genius or crazy? I can't decide.

18:05.586 --> 18:07.796
I only have two more weeks
until the show airs,

18:07.796 --> 18:09.256
so I don't have much time to study.

18:09.882 --> 18:13.802
Well, if you need a study break,
we'll be here grilling.

18:13.802 --> 18:17.139
<i>With my new marinade. Bye, Elizabeth.</i>

18:17.139 --> 18:19.850
- <i>Bye, Charlie.</i>
- I love you. I'll miss you.

18:20.726 --> 18:22.769
<i>I thought Charlie was done
with the graveyard shift.</i>

18:25.522 --> 18:27.065
That's what I thought too.

18:27.774 --> 18:31.528
<i>Use the yellow pages:
the first place to look for anything.</i>

18:31.528 --> 18:34.448
Do I need a catchphrase?
Does every show have a catchphrase?

18:34.448 --> 18:35.532
Don't overthink it.

18:35.532 --> 18:37.159
Never understood what that meant.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.328
Goodbye, Miss Zott.

18:39.328 --> 18:40.787
Goodbye, Mrs. Sloane.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.040
<i>...there goes the dirt.</i>

18:43.040 --> 18:44.917
<i>Yes, sir, the secret words are...</i>

18:44.917 --> 18:46.460
Now, honestly.

18:47.336 --> 18:52.591
"In a word, I had been too cowardly
to do what I knew to be right,

18:52.591 --> 18:57.221
as I had been too cowardly
to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong."

18:57.221 --> 18:58.847
What does that mean?

18:58.847 --> 19:01.725
I think Pip is remembering
the times in his life

19:01.725 --> 19:04.811
when he felt pressured
to do or not do things

19:04.811 --> 19:06.313
because they were expected of him.

19:06.897 --> 19:08.690
And that makes him a coward?

19:10.734 --> 19:12.027
Six Thirty.

19:19.284 --> 19:22.704
Hey, Mad,
do you remember Amanda's dad, Walter?

19:23.413 --> 19:25.541
Do you think that
I am suffering from amnesia?

19:25.541 --> 19:26.959
We just saw him.

19:28.836 --> 19:34.633
What I meant to say is that I'm going to
be working with him at the TV station.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.053
So that means our afternoons
are going to look a little different.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.930
But I like our afternoons.

19:40.514 --> 19:42.140
I love our afternoons.

19:43.016 --> 19:47.354
But I'm going to do
what is expected of me, much like Pip.

19:48.272 --> 19:50.816
I don't get it. You're a scientist.

19:50.816 --> 19:55.946
I will be doing science,
just in a kitchen with TV cameras.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.408
Sort of like a teacher for people
who want to learn how to cook.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.827
Plus, there are financial benefits.

20:02.995 --> 20:05.956
I know it'll be tough,
but you say you don't like school,

20:05.956 --> 20:08.333
and I'm wondering if Caswell--

20:08.333 --> 20:10.460
you know,
that big school down by the park--

20:10.460 --> 20:12.296
if it might be a better fit for you.

20:13.005 --> 20:14.590
Do I have a choice?

20:14.590 --> 20:16.258
I would like you to try it,

20:16.258 --> 20:18.552
and you have full veto power
if you hate it.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.471
It sounds like I'm trying it,
and that's about that.

20:22.181 --> 20:24.558
Full veto power. I promise.

20:27.519 --> 20:28.687
I love you, bunny.

20:28.687 --> 20:30.105
I love you too.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.832
<i>Three, two, one, action!</i>

20:48.832 --> 20:52.836
"I'm Elizabeth Zott,
and this is <i>Supper at Six.</i> Do"--

20:53.921 --> 20:55.297
Well, I can't read this.

20:55.297 --> 20:59.384
And, Walter, I'm losing,
circulation in my arms.

20:59.384 --> 21:01.345
Okay, no, good. Good.

21:01.345 --> 21:03.472
This is good.
This is why we do dress rehearsals.

21:03.472 --> 21:05.974
- Okay. Yes.
- And you look fantastic.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.685
This dress would be fantastic
on a midsize child.

21:09.394 --> 21:10.395
I'm an adult woman.

21:10.395 --> 21:13.649
Good. I love that energy. And, you know--

21:13.649 --> 21:15.025
Could we get bigger cards?

21:15.025 --> 21:18.028
No, It's not that I can't read it.

21:18.028 --> 21:20.531
It's that my conscience
won't let me read that.

21:20.531 --> 21:23.450
I have my own thing prepared.
May I? Or I will.

21:33.293 --> 21:36.505
- Three, two, one?
- You can just talk.

21:36.505 --> 21:37.589
Okay.

21:39.925 --> 21:42.761
I'm Elizabeth Zott,
and this is <i>Supper at Six</i>.

21:42.761 --> 21:44.847
Baking powder is an alkali

21:44.847 --> 21:47.140
that will raise the pH levels
of your chicken skin

21:47.140 --> 21:49.268
and will result in a crisp texture.

21:50.644 --> 21:51.728
I'm gonna take that back.

21:51.728 --> 21:53.438
- Okay, Elizabeth...
- I'm E-- Yes?

21:53.438 --> 21:57.526
...if you make a mistake, just keep going.
It's-- 'Cause the show is live.

21:57.526 --> 22:00.487
- So, you know, we can't go back.
- That's right. Yes. My apologies.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.866
That's right. Okay.

22:05.993 --> 22:06.994
All right.

22:07.494 --> 22:11.164
As I was saying,
baking powder is a leavening agent

22:11.164 --> 22:13.584
which elevates the pH of the chicken skin.

22:13.584 --> 22:17.671
In short,
the skin expands when you cook it.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.966
<i>The more surface area,
the crispier the texture.</i>

22:21.550 --> 22:24.386
- <i>Allow me to demonstrate...</i>
- The skin's pH level? Is this a joke?

22:24.386 --> 22:26.722
We're still finding the show's voice.

22:26.722 --> 22:30.475
Big hair, tight dress, homey set. Check.

22:30.475 --> 22:34.396
But we need a sexy wife,
loving mother that every man loves to see

22:34.396 --> 22:36.398
when he comes home from work.

22:36.398 --> 22:41.695
But this time, we aim to shrink
the square unit of our vegetables.

22:41.695 --> 22:45.032
Square unit? What the fuck is this?

22:46.325 --> 22:48.118
Phil. Look.

22:49.286 --> 22:51.330
I mean, the thing is,

22:51.330 --> 22:54.833
not only is she a cook and a mother,
but she is also a chemist.

22:54.833 --> 22:57.961
So I was thinking let's--
let's play up her credentials,

22:57.961 --> 23:00.589
give housewives someone to aspire to.

23:00.589 --> 23:02.591
- <i>...releases tear gas.</i>
- What are those?

23:02.591 --> 23:04.843
<i>Which is why I prefer goggles,</i>

23:04.843 --> 23:07.137
<i>which are woefully absent
from cookware sets.</i>

23:07.137 --> 23:10.891
Phil, I think we can make
something meaningful here.

23:10.891 --> 23:14.520
Meaningful? What are you, Amish? No!

23:14.520 --> 23:18.023
We want tight dresses,
suggestive movements,

23:18.023 --> 23:21.693
like the way she dons her potholders
just so.

23:22.361 --> 23:25.822
And at the end of every show,
she should make her husband a cocktail.

23:26.406 --> 23:27.824
I don't think Miss Zott

23:27.824 --> 23:30.702
- is gonna be willing to--
- Why the fuck would I care what she wants?

23:31.703 --> 23:32.829
It's her show.

23:33.330 --> 23:36.083
No, Walter. It's my show.

23:41.547 --> 23:42.923
Hi, Six Thirty.

23:48.136 --> 23:49.721
<i>Welcome home, Mad.</i>

23:49.721 --> 23:53.600
<i>Here's your schedule for today.
3:30 to 4:00 p.m., snack time.</i>

23:54.101 --> 23:55.602
<i>There are deviled eggs in the fridge.</i>

23:55.602 --> 23:58.897
<i>Suggestion: They're better
with a little paprika sprinkled on top.</i>

24:02.526 --> 24:04.945
<i>4:00 to 4:30 p.m., homework.</i>

24:07.573 --> 24:10.659
<i>I always liked to do whatever
my least favorite subject was first.</i>

24:11.743 --> 24:12.911
<i>It gets it out of the way.</i>

24:16.039 --> 24:18.542
<i>4:30 to 5:00 p.m., reading.</i>

24:19.501 --> 24:23.797
<i>Read</i> Great Expectations <i>to Six Thirty.
We left off on page 87.</i>

24:26.550 --> 24:29.845
<i>5:00 to 6:00 p.m.,
Mrs. Waterhouse will babysit,</i>

24:29.845 --> 24:32.431
<i>or Linda will take you to church
for her choir practice.</i>

24:34.474 --> 24:37.394
<i>Look both ways before you cross
the street, and don't forget:</i>

24:37.895 --> 24:41.648
<i>God is not real, but we respect
other people's belief systems.</i>

24:42.149 --> 24:44.985
<i>I'll be home for dinner. I love you. Mom.</i>

25:38.205 --> 25:41.166
- Mad! We gotta go!
- Coming!

25:49.716 --> 25:54.763
<i>Pass me not
O gentle savior</i>

25:55.264 --> 25:59.268
<i>Hear my humble cry</i>

26:00.602 --> 26:05.566
<i>While on others thou art smiling</i>

26:06.066 --> 26:08.777
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

26:11.363 --> 26:14.199
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

26:16.910 --> 26:22.082
<i>Pass me not
O gentle savior</i>

26:22.082 --> 26:25.836
<i>Hear my humble cry...</i>

26:25.836 --> 26:28.255
Hello. Who might you be?

26:29.339 --> 26:31.884
I can't tell you yet
because I don't know you.

26:31.884 --> 26:33.051
That makes sense.

26:34.887 --> 26:37.848
I'm Reverend Wakely. This is my church.

26:38.891 --> 26:43.020
I'm Mad Zott. I don't have a church
because my mom says God isn't real.

26:44.521 --> 26:45.689
I'm Linda's neighbor.

26:51.612 --> 26:54.198
A family tree. How fun.

26:55.199 --> 26:56.366
That's debatable.

26:57.451 --> 27:00.454
- Debatable?
- It means arguable.

27:02.122 --> 27:03.123
Yes, it does.

27:04.541 --> 27:05.709
What have you got so far?

27:08.212 --> 27:11.548
On my mom's side, I have Ezra and Iris,

27:11.548 --> 27:14.009
but I don't have anything
on my dad's side yet.

27:14.009 --> 27:15.427
I don't know where to start.

27:16.345 --> 27:17.638
Why not just ask him?

27:18.722 --> 27:19.932
He's dead.

27:21.892 --> 27:23.018
I'm so sorry.

27:24.102 --> 27:26.772
People say you can't miss
what you never had,

27:27.356 --> 27:30.692
but I think people are wrong. Don't you?

27:31.860 --> 27:34.238
I think people are very wrong.

27:35.822 --> 27:37.324
And what are these?

27:38.784 --> 27:41.119
Some clues I found in my dad's study,

27:41.703 --> 27:45.123
which I never went through,
if anyone ever asks you.

27:48.001 --> 27:52.548
But I don't know which school he went to,
so it's useless.

27:56.134 --> 27:57.386
See the winged bull?

27:58.595 --> 28:00.138
That's how they draw St. Luke.

28:00.138 --> 28:02.516
Your dad went to a school
called St. Luke's.

28:04.268 --> 28:06.979
Now, which St. Luke's?

28:07.938 --> 28:09.022
That's the question.

28:10.816 --> 28:17.781
<i>Do not pass me by</i>

28:25.581 --> 28:27.207
And that concludes our time.

28:27.207 --> 28:30.919
Tomorrow on <i>Supper at Six</i>,
we will study colloids.

28:30.919 --> 28:33.005
Although, I don't know why
the show is called <i>Supper at Six</i>.

28:33.005 --> 28:36.967
It should be called <i>Supper at 5:30</i>.
But here we are.

28:37.467 --> 28:42.306
Walter, we need to discuss the title.
It's incredibly misleading.

28:42.306 --> 28:47.060
Well, we can discuss that.
And I just-- Let's have a drink.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.520
I don't really drink.

28:48.520 --> 28:50.189
- I do.
- Okay.

28:50.772 --> 28:53.483
I know what you're going to say,
and adjustments will be made.

28:53.483 --> 28:54.776
I took notes.

28:55.360 --> 28:59.823
The set: altogether too cluttered.
Cue cards: unnecessary, eliminate.

28:59.823 --> 29:04.703
Wardrobe: Walter, this dress is obscene,
and I need my lab coat.

29:07.206 --> 29:08.832
- What? You won't consider a lab coat?
- Elizabeth.

29:08.832 --> 29:10.542
It has more surface area than an apron.

29:10.542 --> 29:12.628
I don't understand
why everyone doesn't cook in a lab coat.

29:12.628 --> 29:14.796
Elizabeth, it's not about the lab coat.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.967
Phil hated the show.

29:20.135 --> 29:22.304
Phil? Who's Phil?

29:22.304 --> 29:24.598
He's the station owner.

29:24.598 --> 29:27.559
I hate him. I hate him so much.

29:27.559 --> 29:32.773
He haunts me in my dreams.
He haunts me when I'm awake.

29:33.565 --> 29:36.235
Do I care what Phil thinks?

29:36.235 --> 29:38.278
- No, I do not.
- But...

29:39.988 --> 29:44.618
I agree with him.
We do need to make some changes.

29:44.618 --> 29:46.662
I knew this was going to happen, Walter.

29:46.662 --> 29:50.082
- You said that this would be my show.
- Yeah, and it is. It is.

29:51.250 --> 29:52.543
So make it yours.

29:55.963 --> 29:57.339
You know what I love about TV?

30:01.677 --> 30:02.678
Everything.

30:03.679 --> 30:09.309
It has the power to transport
and entertain.

30:10.269 --> 30:13.355
It can make you feel a part of something.

30:15.148 --> 30:20.696
The problem with the show today wasn't
a set problem or a wardrobe problem.

30:20.696 --> 30:26.660
It's more I wanted to see you be you.
Not just a scientist.

30:26.660 --> 30:29.371
But I am a scientist. That is who I am.

30:29.371 --> 30:30.956
That may be.

30:32.249 --> 30:34.877
But that's only a start.

30:49.266 --> 30:53.395
Mrs. Mudford said I've been doing
really, really well in class.

30:53.395 --> 30:58.859
I bit my tongue till it bled when she
had us draw penguins with coats and hats.

30:58.859 --> 31:00.360
I guess she doesn't know

31:00.360 --> 31:04.031
that many groups of penguins
actually live below the equator.

31:04.031 --> 31:05.741
Well, that is a common misconception.

31:05.741 --> 31:08.285
And I haven't asked the librarian
for a single book!

31:08.285 --> 31:09.286
And at the cafeteria,

31:09.286 --> 31:11.413
- I didn't share my lunch with Amanda--
- Mad.

31:11.413 --> 31:13.665
I understand that you're nervous
about switching schools.

31:13.665 --> 31:16.335
But change is good. Change is evolution.

31:17.211 --> 31:19.671
We're gonna split up. Do you wanna do
the butcher counter or dairy?

31:20.255 --> 31:21.965
Can't I just stay with you?

31:24.676 --> 31:25.969
Sure, bunny.

31:38.315 --> 31:39.191
Come in.

31:40.317 --> 31:43.570
So, small, tiny, little change in plans.

31:43.570 --> 31:45.906
- Nothing big.
- Yes?

31:45.906 --> 31:47.282
Really barely perceptible.

31:47.282 --> 31:48.450
Walter.

31:49.034 --> 31:50.118
We--

31:51.078 --> 31:53.956
<i>Supper at Six</i> is airing tonight.
Today. Right now.

31:54.790 --> 31:57.376
On TV? But we still have
two more weeks of rehearsals.

31:57.376 --> 32:01.296
The reruns of the show
that you replaced are not performing.

32:01.296 --> 32:03.131
And here's the thing.
Here's the good news.

32:03.131 --> 32:05.259
And I maybe should've said this earlier.

32:05.259 --> 32:09.346
We're the lowest-rated channel,
so very few people will be tuned in.

32:09.346 --> 32:11.098
And Phil hates us,

32:11.098 --> 32:13.809
and he actually may be doing this
as a reason to cancel the show.

32:14.393 --> 32:18.063
So when you said you liaise with talent,
is this what you were referring to?

32:18.063 --> 32:19.648
I did not say I was good at it.

32:21.775 --> 32:22.776
Break a leg.

32:23.277 --> 32:24.361
I am considering it.

32:31.535 --> 32:34.663
Testing. Testing.
One, two, three.

32:34.663 --> 32:37.958
Testing. Testing. One, two, three.

32:41.837 --> 32:43.755
Shari, take note of this placement.

32:44.715 --> 32:47.634
Let's go! Let's go, people!

32:48.302 --> 32:50.888
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

32:53.390 --> 32:57.895
We're live in five, four, three, two, one.

33:14.203 --> 33:17.331
I take cooking seriously,
and I know you do too.

33:17.998 --> 33:21.293
I also know that your time is precious,
and, well, so is mine.

33:21.293 --> 33:24.838
Is that a fucking pencil?
What does she need a fucking pencil for?

33:24.838 --> 33:28.467
In my experience, people do not appreciate
the work and sacrifice

33:28.467 --> 33:31.470
that goes into being
a mother, a wife, a woman.

33:32.262 --> 33:33.931
Well, I am not one of those people.

33:34.515 --> 33:37.935
At the end of our time here together,
we will have done something worth doing.

33:38.602 --> 33:41.563
We will have created
something that will not go unnoticed.

33:41.563 --> 33:44.107
We will have made supper,
and it will matter.

33:46.235 --> 33:48.403
I prefer to have room
when I'm doing my work.

33:48.403 --> 33:51.865
It reinforces that the work we're doing
together is important.

33:53.408 --> 33:55.244
Harry, would you mind helping me
clear these things?

33:55.244 --> 33:57.829
And Eugene, Amos. Thank you.

34:09.842 --> 34:12.678
Cooking is chemistry,
and chemistry is life.

34:12.678 --> 34:16.681
Your ability to change everything,
including yourself, starts here.

34:17.641 --> 34:18.725
Let's begin, shall we?

34:27.400 --> 34:28.819
<i>What worked for you with the show?</i>

34:29.527 --> 34:32.697
I'm an insomniac,
and it put me right to sleep.

34:34.324 --> 34:38.661
Potatoes are rich in vitamin C,
potassium and complex carbohydrates.

34:38.661 --> 34:41.831
I stand proudly with
the overlooked workhorse of the kitchen:

34:41.831 --> 34:43.667
women and baked potatoes.

34:44.251 --> 34:45.752
Yes?

34:45.752 --> 34:48.547
- I actually thought that she was--
- Would it have killed her to smile?

34:48.547 --> 34:51.257
Totally.
And it looks like she's got a good figure,

34:51.257 --> 34:53.010
but she's hiding it
behind that weird coat.

34:53.010 --> 34:56.471
I am putting cinnamon in my chili.
I've never done that before.

34:56.972 --> 34:59.057
Don't be afraid to experiment
in the kitchen.

34:59.558 --> 35:02.644
Fearlessness in the kitchen
equates to fearlessness in life.

35:03.478 --> 35:06.106
Describe how you felt watching
the show in one word.

35:06.857 --> 35:08.525
- Bored.
- Punished.

35:08.525 --> 35:11.069
- Drained. Depressed.
- Saddened. Lost.

35:11.862 --> 35:12.863
Yes, your word?

35:13.530 --> 35:14.364
Capable.

35:15.324 --> 35:17.117
Capable?
What the hell does that even mean?

35:23.790 --> 35:25.626
And that is all we have time for today.

35:25.626 --> 35:26.960
I hope you'll join me tomorrow

35:26.960 --> 35:29.296
as we explore
the fascinating world of temperature

35:29.296 --> 35:31.507
and how it affects taste receptor cells.

35:34.801 --> 35:37.971
Children, set the table. Your mother needs
a moment to herself.

35:45.103 --> 35:46.230
And we're clear.

35:47.648 --> 35:50.734
<i>He's got the whole world in his hands</i>

35:50.734 --> 35:55.322
<i>He's got the whole world in his hands
He's got the whole world...</i>

35:55.322 --> 35:57.741
I was hoping
I would see my new favorite detective.

35:58.325 --> 35:59.493
Hi, Mr. Wakely.

36:00.744 --> 36:04.623
I hope I'm not stepping on any toes,
but here's a list of all the St. Luke's

36:04.623 --> 36:10.045
in Alabama, Alaska, Arizona,
Arkansas, California, Colorado,

36:10.045 --> 36:11.964
Connecticut and Delaware.

36:11.964 --> 36:15.175
Now, it'll be up to you to get all
the way to Wisconsin and Wyoming.

36:15.175 --> 36:18.136
Wow. How did you do this?

36:18.136 --> 36:20.264
I got them from the yellow pages
at the library.

36:20.764 --> 36:24.101
You go state by state and look up all
the St. Luke's. And there's a lot too.

36:24.601 --> 36:26.436
Churches tend not to have
the greatest imagination

36:26.436 --> 36:27.896
when it comes down to names.

36:27.896 --> 36:29.606
Why are you helping me?

36:30.107 --> 36:32.651
Because people who don't ask questions
have blind faith,

36:32.651 --> 36:35.737
and blind faith is the furthest thing
from faith.

36:37.281 --> 36:39.241
Can you say that again slower?

36:39.825 --> 36:41.869
"How would you describe the host?"

36:41.869 --> 36:47.791
"Stuck up." "Unpleasant."
"Didn't smile once."

36:48.375 --> 36:49.751
Smile?

36:49.751 --> 36:53.297
Do surgeons smile
while performing appendectomies? No.

36:53.297 --> 36:54.631
Would you want them to? No.

36:54.631 --> 36:56.592
- Mr. Lebensmal?
- Not now.

36:57.176 --> 37:00.304
If I tell you to smile,
you're gonna fucking smile.

37:00.304 --> 37:01.471
I will not.

37:01.471 --> 37:03.724
I think what Elizabeth is trying to say--

37:03.724 --> 37:05.601
He knows what I'm saying
because I'm saying it.

37:05.601 --> 37:07.144
Listen to me, young lady.

37:07.769 --> 37:10.981
I am the owner of this station.
Do you understand?

37:11.690 --> 37:14.860
Will someone answer those fucking phones?

37:16.612 --> 37:18.030
You cannot just come in here

37:18.030 --> 37:19.823
and do whatever the hell you want.

37:19.823 --> 37:23.952
I am not doing whatever the hell I want.
If I was, I would be in a research lab.

37:24.578 --> 37:25.787
Let me explain something to you.

37:25.787 --> 37:29.875
Men are always trying to explain,
and women are expected to sit and listen.

37:30.459 --> 37:32.169
I do not want this job,
but I need the money

37:32.169 --> 37:35.255
and I will work harder than anyone
to make this a show that I am proud of.

37:35.255 --> 37:38.592
But you want a show that perpetuates
the myth that women are imbeciles

37:38.592 --> 37:40.010
and the biggest decision of their day

37:40.010 --> 37:41.678
is what color
they're gonna paint their nails.

37:41.678 --> 37:44.973
I will not do that, and there is no amount
of menace that will change my mind.

37:44.973 --> 37:49.102
A man wants his wife to make him a drink
after a long day at work.

37:49.102 --> 37:52.231
So make the fucking drink.

37:52.231 --> 37:55.192
Why do you assume
that his day was longer than hers?

37:55.776 --> 37:57.528
Why don't you make the fucking drink?

37:57.528 --> 37:58.987
- Mr. Lebensmal.
- What?

37:58.987 --> 38:01.365
We're getting
a lot of calls about the show.

38:01.365 --> 38:03.617
Some confusion
about tomorrow's ingredients.

38:03.617 --> 38:07.079
Specifically, CH3COOH.

38:07.079 --> 38:09.748
Acetic acid. Vinegar. It's 4% acetic acid.

38:09.748 --> 38:12.417
I'm sorry. I should've put the list
in layman's terms.

38:13.085 --> 38:16.839
We might need to hire a few more girls
if the phones keep going like this.

38:20.884 --> 38:23.011
If you hold on, I can get you
that information in a second.

38:23.595 --> 38:26.807
CH3COOH is vinegar.

38:26.807 --> 38:28.267
<i>Supper at Six</i>, can you hold?

38:31.687 --> 38:32.896
Hello. <i>Supper at Six</i>.

38:37.317 --> 38:39.778
Hello, <i>Supper at Six</i>. This is Elizabeth.

38:40.529 --> 38:41.822
Yes, that Elizabeth.

38:43.156 --> 38:44.908
I'm so happy that you liked the show.

38:56.545 --> 38:59.256
<i>- What you're seeing is combustion.</i>
- Yes.

38:59.256 --> 39:01.550
<i>The effect is dramatic,
but the science is simple.</i>

39:04.344 --> 39:06.597
Best served with cake.

39:19.776 --> 39:21.737
<i>I don't think I've ever curtsied before.</i>

39:21.737 --> 39:25.157
<i>Well, there's a first time for everything.
And a last.</i>

39:36.668 --> 39:38.212
<i>I'll see you tomorrow.</i>

39:38.212 --> 39:41.590
<i>Children, set the table. Your mother needs
a moment to herself.</i>

39:49.431 --> 39:51.391
Hello. Sorry, I'm a little late.

39:52.226 --> 39:53.227
A little?

39:54.394 --> 39:57.272
Well, these women drove
all the way from San Francisco

39:57.272 --> 39:59.024
and had a million questions
about churned butter.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.693
And I had to go over the supply list
with the crew and--

40:02.194 --> 40:03.195
Well, it doesn't matter.

40:03.946 --> 40:05.197
What did I miss?

40:05.864 --> 40:06.865
Everything.

40:10.702 --> 40:13.789
Well, there's only one thing to do
I suppose.

40:18.836 --> 40:21.338
So tell me. Tell me everything.

40:21.338 --> 40:26.218
Everyone that I've met at Caswell so far
seems polite and smart and there to learn.

40:26.718 --> 40:29.888
Well, the library is big.

40:31.056 --> 40:33.976
I checked out
<i>The Real Life of Sebastian Knight</i>,

40:33.976 --> 40:36.520
and so far, it's a pretty good book.

40:36.520 --> 40:38.313
- I am so sorry to interrupt...
- It--

40:38.313 --> 40:41.608
...but I watch your show every day
and the episode about soufflés

40:41.608 --> 40:44.570
and rising to the occasion
was really inspiring.

40:44.570 --> 40:46.780
My sister was afraid to ask her boss
for a raise,

40:46.780 --> 40:48.782
but I just told her what you said.

40:48.782 --> 40:53.954
That "fear is simply neurotransmitters
reacting to a perceived threat."

40:53.954 --> 40:56.039
And she got it. She got the raise.

40:56.623 --> 40:58.834
Wow. That is fantastic.

40:58.834 --> 41:01.044
I'm gonna bring you
a free piece of cobbler.

41:01.628 --> 41:02.629
Thank you.

41:03.463 --> 41:04.882
Cobbler.

41:08.635 --> 41:11.555
I'm sorry. Mad, will you please tell me
more about your book?

41:13.140 --> 41:15.976
- Well--
- Okay, here we go.

41:17.102 --> 41:19.855
And I am so sorry, could you just
please sign this?

41:21.273 --> 41:22.274
Of course.

41:23.859 --> 41:24.860
Thank you.

41:25.444 --> 41:27.112
- Wow. Thank you.
- Thank you.

41:30.741 --> 41:33.869
Again, I'm very sorry.
You have my full attention.

41:36.914 --> 41:38.332
Can we just go home?

41:41.126 --> 41:43.504
Why don't we finish our dinner,
and then we'll go home.

41:45.172 --> 41:46.340
Okay.
