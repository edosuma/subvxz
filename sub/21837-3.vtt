00:02.040 --> 00:05.880
We slept together. - He drugged you?
Why else would he swap the glasses?

00:05.920 --> 00:08.600
Are you so sure about this?
- You know what you did!

00:08.640 --> 00:11.880
Your post. It keeps getting shared.
- She said you raped her.

00:11.920 --> 00:15.080
It's about Laura Nielson.
She's done this before.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.280
I love you, Katy.
- Stop it!

00:17.320 --> 00:22.320
I broke into Andrew's house. Under his bed
I found a clear liquid. Please help me.

00:22.360 --> 00:25.640
I need a favour. - We have a warrant
to search your house.

00:25.680 --> 00:30.000
Andrew Earlham is dangerous. - Laura,
please, for your own sake, stop.

01:32.520 --> 01:36.720
You should've
kept your mouth shut, bitch!

01:54.120 --> 01:56.120
Morning.
- Morning.

02:08.759 --> 02:13.920
Look, er, Katy, I... really appreciate
you letting me stay with you,

02:13.960 --> 02:17.880
but I think it's time
that I went home. Oh, Laura.

02:17.920 --> 02:20.760
I've gotta go there this morning.
All my stuff's there.

02:20.800 --> 02:23.160
So I'll bring
some more clothes over.

02:23.200 --> 02:27.440
No, honestly. I just...
I thought I'd feel better here,

02:27.480 --> 02:30.840
but it...
it just follows you around, so...

02:32.280 --> 02:36.080
I just need to get on with my life.
That's all I can do.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.440
Thank you for everything.

02:41.600 --> 02:45.240
Call me any time, night or day.
You hear?

02:46.240 --> 02:50.120
Call me. Yeah.
Promise? I will.

02:50.160 --> 02:54.160
And I'll pop in to see you
after work tomorrow. OK, great.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.120
Right.

03:00.960 --> 03:04.680
Oh, erm, have you seen my earring?
You know, the long, silver ones?

03:04.720 --> 03:09.400
Er... no, I don't think so.
Where did you leave them?

03:11.000 --> 03:13.240
Don't worry. It doesn't matter.

04:22.320 --> 04:26.240
Oh, my God!

04:26.280 --> 04:31.680
Ohh. Hey, so, listen, I've gotta ask, it's been
bugging me all night, what on earth is that?

04:31.720 --> 04:34.240
Oh, that's Monty!
- What?

04:34.280 --> 04:36.920
Monty.
- Really? - Yeah!

04:36.960 --> 04:40.000
Tom and I went to a fair last year

04:40.040 --> 04:44.440
and, erm, he went on one of those basketball
stands, you know, where you win a prize,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.800
and he tried and tried
and couldn't get him.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.280
But my first go, I won Monty.
- Naturally.

04:49.320 --> 04:53.800
So after that, I kept him in here,
mainly just to piss Tom off.

04:53.840 --> 04:56.800
I should really get rid of him.
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

04:56.840 --> 05:02.520
What self-respecting woman in her 30s doesn't
have a stuffed rabbit in her living room?

05:14.240 --> 05:16.280
Oh, shit.

05:20.000 --> 05:22.160
Mr Earlham?
- Mr Walters.

05:26.480 --> 05:29.680
It was white with one sugar
you said, wasn't it? Yeah.

05:31.440 --> 05:34.320
I like your house.
Thanks.

05:35.320 --> 05:38.560
You should see my place.
Bloody cesspit.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.960
So, Mr Walters...
- Dennis. Dennis is fine.

05:44.960 --> 05:48.000
So, Dennis...
- Ooh, that's good!

05:48.040 --> 05:51.080
I should get one of those machines.
Makes a difference.

05:51.120 --> 05:55.600
Better than instant, they say, don't they?
Even though it seems pretty instant to me.

05:55.640 --> 05:57.280
Dennis...

05:58.280 --> 06:01.640
I don't wanna rush you
and I don't wanna seem rude, but...

06:02.720 --> 06:06.800
what exactly did you mean when you
said Laura had done this before? Sorry.

06:07.880 --> 06:13.080
So, I was headmaster
at St Caspar's in Bristol.

06:13.120 --> 06:15.480
15 years I was headmaster.

06:16.640 --> 06:20.160
Let me tell you, before me,
they were at sea, at bloody sea.

06:21.400 --> 06:23.920
I stepped up
when no-one else wanted to.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.120
I turned that place around.

06:26.160 --> 06:28.720
And, er, what happened?

06:28.760 --> 06:32.120
So, Laura Nielson
was one of my teachers.

06:33.120 --> 06:36.040
One of my best. I'd never
had any problems with her.

06:37.040 --> 06:41.240
Until the day she accused me
of sexual harassment, that is.

06:41.280 --> 06:43.520
You're kidding.
No.

06:46.160 --> 06:49.440
Next thing I know,
I'm standing in front of the board.

06:50.520 --> 06:52.840
15 years I gave my life to that place

06:52.880 --> 06:55.760
and I'm standing there
having to explain myself.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.840
All she has to do is to say this crap

06:57.880 --> 07:00.600
and I'm the one
who has to prove otherwise.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.400
But I did.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.080
I'm the one who stayed.
She's the one who had to leave.

07:08.120 --> 07:13.080
They cleared you? After the damage
was done, yeah, they cleared me.

07:13.120 --> 07:17.600
And after I have a chat with the police,
let them know exactly what happened,

07:17.640 --> 07:20.320
they'll clear you, too.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.560
Makeda.

07:30.560 --> 07:33.640
Makeda! You're going to be late!

07:43.320 --> 07:46.320
Just the revolve, really.
I need to order a part.

07:49.280 --> 07:52.720
I'll do my best, but... Just let me
know how long it will take.

07:52.760 --> 07:55.880
I can't afford to have it
lying idle. This is an old model.

07:55.920 --> 08:00.240
Can you give me a rough idea?
I'll do my best, but... Makeda.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.960
What are you still doing here? It's
8.30. I know. I know, I'm going.

09:03.160 --> 09:05.840
Hey!

09:05.880 --> 09:08.120
What the hell is going on in here?

09:08.160 --> 09:10.720
I'll be speaking to the head
about all of you!

09:12.080 --> 09:15.240
Luke, are you all right? What
the hell was that about? Get out.

09:15.280 --> 09:18.880
Hey, I'm trying to help you.
Help me?

09:19.880 --> 09:21.920
This is because of you!
It's your fault!

09:22.920 --> 09:27.480
What do you mean? This is what happens
when everyone thinks your dad's a rapist.

09:28.520 --> 09:31.680
That isn't the issue here, Luke.
I'm trying to help you.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.600
Well, don't. Haven't you
ruined my life enough already?

09:37.920 --> 09:41.160
It got ugly around the school,
you know.

09:41.200 --> 09:45.920
PTA meetings,
people asking for me to resign.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
Before I'd even have a fair hearing.

09:50.040 --> 09:54.120
And then...
she withdrew the complaint.

09:56.240 --> 09:59.960
Laura Nielson withdrew the sexual
harassment complaint? Yeah.

10:00.960 --> 10:03.520
She said all the stress was too much.

10:03.560 --> 10:07.960
She was on, erm... anti-depressants
at the time, she said.

10:09.080 --> 10:12.720
She just couldn't cope with
all the attention.

10:14.960 --> 10:17.080
It still ruined me, though.

10:18.080 --> 10:20.760
Because people don't forget, do they?

10:22.480 --> 10:25.560
Not the mums at the school gates,
anyway.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.840
They don't forget a thing.

10:28.880 --> 10:34.720
And the mouths they've got on them. OK, well, we've
got your statement now. Thanks for coming in.

10:34.760 --> 10:38.600
Of course, yes. Just doing my duty.

10:38.640 --> 10:41.760
Terminating interview at 10.42.

10:43.440 --> 10:47.960
The truth... it needs to come out,
doesn't it? It's important.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.640
I can't have her do this to another
man that's done nothing wrong.

10:53.680 --> 10:57.600
If you could follow me, sir, I'll
take you through to the front desk.

11:11.280 --> 11:12.720
Mr Earlham.

11:14.000 --> 11:17.440
Well, this changes everything,
doesn't it? We'll be in touch.

11:17.480 --> 11:20.800
The woman isn't mentally stable.
Her whole case, like his,

11:20.840 --> 11:24.680
is just her word, her claim that I made
her do something against her will.

11:24.720 --> 11:27.920
I'm telling you categorically,
I know that's not true.

11:27.960 --> 11:31.640
The investigation is ongoing.
That's all we can say at this point.

11:31.680 --> 11:36.480
Have you ever read Nietzsche? There's
a quote from one of his essays.

11:36.520 --> 11:40.280
"I'm not upset that you lied to me,
I'm upset that from now on

11:40.320 --> 11:42.680
I can't believe you."

11:42.720 --> 11:45.720
Seems apt. It's the boy
who cried wolf, isn't it?

11:47.920 --> 11:50.120
You know, I feel sorry for her,
actually.

11:50.160 --> 11:52.360
Despite everything.

11:52.400 --> 11:54.440
I mean, it hasn't been easy.

11:55.480 --> 11:58.440
But maybe she needs
to see someone, huh?

11:58.480 --> 12:00.760
Maybe she needs help.

12:02.920 --> 12:07.440
Doesn't matter, something that happened
in the past, no relevance to the case.

12:07.480 --> 12:11.720
Not right here, right now. We both know
the CPS will look at it differently.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.760
"Hiya." - Hey.
- "You all right?"

12:54.800 --> 12:56.720
Not really. I, erm...

12:56.760 --> 13:00.000
One of my earrings is missing.
I noticed it the other night.

13:00.040 --> 13:02.960
And, erm,
I've looked everywhere for it. I...

13:03.000 --> 13:07.000
I've been thinking that maybe, erm...
What if it came off in Andrew's house?

13:07.040 --> 13:10.880
You can't be sure that's where you left it.
I've looked everywhere else.

13:10.920 --> 13:15.680
If he finds it, he's gonna know I've been
in there. "You're worried about nothing."

13:15.720 --> 13:20.880
You can't let him get in your head like this.
Let the police do their job. Erm...

13:22.920 --> 13:27.000
Dennis has been texting me.
- Dennis Walters? - Yeah.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.920
He's enjoying it, winding me up.

13:29.960 --> 13:34.480
This has nothing to do with what Andrew did to
you, OK? Ignore him. The guy's a waste of air.

13:34.520 --> 13:38.280
I dropped the accusation, Tom.
All the stress,

13:38.320 --> 13:42.120
everything that happened with Mum and
every day at school, I was on edge,

13:42.160 --> 13:45.240
so I let it go, and...

13:45.280 --> 13:48.040
Do you really think
they're gonna believe me now?

13:55.267 --> 13:58.907
Hiya, mate. Can I get a cappuccino,
please? Just one shot.

13:58.947 --> 14:01.467
Go on. Go on, look,
there's a seat over there.

14:01.507 --> 14:05.307
No, you're not supposed to touch
that! - Sorry. - Find a seat, quickly.

14:05.347 --> 14:08.867
Up there, this one. Have you asked
him? What, if he's cheating?

14:08.907 --> 14:12.307
Sit down nicely.
No. I'm not even sure I wanna know.

14:12.347 --> 14:14.427
So maybe you're wrong.

14:14.467 --> 14:19.267
There's nothing I can actually put my
finger on, it's just... You wanna colour?

14:19.307 --> 14:22.787
It's just the little things.
A lot of late nights.

14:22.827 --> 14:25.507
Then again, he always did work hard.

14:25.547 --> 14:28.667
He used to invite me to the work
parties, now he doesn't.

14:28.707 --> 14:34.067
The worst thing, I know this is gonna
sound stupid, he used to complain.

14:34.107 --> 14:37.227
Like, he used to come home from work
and he would just vent

14:37.267 --> 14:39.907
about some pointless meeting
he'd had

14:39.947 --> 14:43.627
or some ridiculous email his boss
had sent him, stupid things.

14:43.667 --> 14:47.627
But instead, he buys me presents.

14:48.707 --> 14:51.987
Every few weeks, some thoughtful
gesture out of the blue.

14:52.027 --> 14:54.867
He has never done that before.

14:58.227 --> 15:00.827
I mean, I wish Mark
would do that for me.

15:00.867 --> 15:03.627
Look, I hear what you say,
but it could be nothing.

15:03.667 --> 15:07.147
Maybe you should just talk to him
and ask him outright.

15:10.387 --> 15:13.627
You've spoken to the police?
I have. We had a good chat.

15:13.667 --> 15:16.587
Filled them in on our history,
our misunderstanding.

15:16.627 --> 15:19.387
Why? This has got
nothing to do with you.

15:19.427 --> 15:23.387
He's just like me. Some bloke goes to
work, tries to get through the day,

15:23.427 --> 15:25.987
tries to be decent,
and turns into another victim.

15:26.027 --> 15:28.187
Why are you doing this?

15:29.227 --> 15:33.227
I dropped the accusation. Everyone
told me a shouldn't, but I did.

15:33.267 --> 15:37.227
That's not how it works, is it? You
can't scream fire in a crowded building

15:37.267 --> 15:41.347
then shrug your shoulders and pretend
you didn't create bloody havoc.

15:41.387 --> 15:46.067
All a woman's gotta do these days is to say some
guy touched her and if you don't believe her

15:46.107 --> 15:50.987
you're an animal for even thinking so, you're
abusing their rights, you're a misogynist.

15:51.027 --> 15:55.947
"How is that fair? We're equal, aren't we?
Isn't that how it's supposed to work?"

15:55.987 --> 15:58.667
This was a mistake.

16:18.907 --> 16:22.547
Makeda? Are you all right?

16:23.707 --> 16:26.307
I'm fine. It's nothing.
You don't look fine.

16:26.347 --> 16:29.307
Let me take you to the school nurse.
I'm fine!

16:29.347 --> 16:32.787
Miss, honest.
Erm, just leave me alone, yeah?

16:34.347 --> 16:37.067
Makeda, hey, hey, stop.

16:37.107 --> 16:39.267
Er... you're bleeding.

16:39.307 --> 16:41.907
Erm, yeah, I know, miss.
You're pregnant.

16:41.947 --> 16:45.867
I did the test a week ago.
Why don't you let me take you home?

16:45.907 --> 16:48.987
No. No, no, no, miss, erm, er,

16:49.027 --> 16:52.827
I went online, I took some pills
to make the baby go away.

16:52.867 --> 16:57.827
The packet said there might be some bleeding
but it's fine. It's normal. OK, OK, shh.

16:57.867 --> 17:00.107
Are you in pain? Don't lie to me.

17:00.147 --> 17:02.347
Yes! Yes.
Yes! - OK.

17:02.387 --> 17:05.627
I'm gonna drive you to A&amp;E, OK?
Come on.

17:05.666 --> 17:08.747
Oh, my dad, my dad,
he can't find out about any of this.

17:08.787 --> 17:14.307
Let's take this one step at a time. First we need to
get you checked, then we'll worry about your dad.

17:15.347 --> 17:17.946
Hey, Birav.

17:17.987 --> 17:22.827
Are you free to take my year seven
reading group this afternoon?

17:24.267 --> 17:29.547
OK, amazing. Yeah, I just, erm,
I need to take Makeda Kidane to A&amp;E.

17:30.867 --> 17:33.467
No, she's fine,
she just needs someone with her.

17:34.747 --> 17:37.147
It's not over, you know?

17:37.187 --> 17:39.627
Just like it wasn't over for me.

17:39.667 --> 17:42.267
Well, at least the police
know everything now.

17:42.307 --> 17:44.467
I really appreciate it.

17:47.427 --> 17:52.347
Listen, most time, it's not the fire
that kills people.

17:52.387 --> 17:55.347
It's the smoke that gets in
their lungs and chokes them.

17:55.387 --> 17:58.427
You wanna kill something,
kill it dead.

17:58.467 --> 18:01.707
I can go to the press if you like,
let them know what happened.

18:01.747 --> 18:05.627
I just want this thing done,
you know?

18:09.427 --> 18:11.507
It's weird.

18:11.547 --> 18:15.067
Seeing her face after all these
years. Brings it all back, you know?

18:16.107 --> 18:18.867
That bitch put me through so much.

18:19.947 --> 18:24.307
Then she changes her mind,
says, "Oh, sorry, I take it back."

18:24.347 --> 18:27.627
Like it's all over after that.
Like we all get to walk away.

18:31.107 --> 18:35.627
The day it happened, I still
remember it clear as anything.

18:37.187 --> 18:39.627
She came into my office
crying about her mum.

18:41.187 --> 18:44.547
So I did what any decent person
would. I gave her a hug.

18:45.547 --> 18:49.627
And she squeezed me and... The kind
of squeeze that says something.

18:50.627 --> 18:54.347
The kind of squeeze you don't give
to someone who's just a friend.

18:58.547 --> 19:00.827
So you felt her up?

19:02.827 --> 19:06.267
Well, not... You told me
that she made the whole thing up.

19:06.307 --> 19:09.907
Well, she may as well have. It wasn't
like I was the one... Sorry.

19:09.947 --> 19:13.027
I shouldn't be here.
I've gotta get going.

19:13.067 --> 19:16.427
Hey, hold up. What's wrong?
I didn't ask for this.

19:17.667 --> 19:19.467
Not you.

19:19.507 --> 19:21.667
Not her. I... I just...

19:21.707 --> 19:26.027
I saved your arse. You should be
thanking me! Have a nice trip.

19:37.627 --> 19:40.427
I am gonna have to call
one of your parents. No.

19:40.467 --> 19:42.987
Miss, no.
I'm sure your dad will understand.

19:43.027 --> 19:45.347
He'll want to know
if you're all right.

19:45.387 --> 19:48.867
Just call Luke.
Luke? Luke Earlham.

19:51.067 --> 19:54.507
He's the father?
Yes, miss. Please, just call him.

19:56.227 --> 19:57.267
Please.

19:58.667 --> 20:00.867
All right, erm...

20:00.907 --> 20:03.027
Let's just get you seen to, OK?

20:03.067 --> 20:05.547
And, erm... And then I'll, er,

20:05.587 --> 20:08.707
I'll... call Luke.
Thank you.

20:08.747 --> 20:13.667
"Hi, this is Luke. Please leave a
message after the tone. Thanks. Bye."

20:15.747 --> 20:18.507
Makeda Kidane?
- Yes. Yep. - Follow me.

20:18.547 --> 20:21.187
Come on through here.

20:21.227 --> 20:25.707
How many pills did you take? - There were
five in the pack and I took all of them.

20:25.747 --> 20:28.507
All right,
I'm gonna roll your sleeves up.

20:28.547 --> 20:31.987
Please, please get Luke.
I've tried, Makeda.

20:32.027 --> 20:36.867
He's just not picking up. He told me he was going
home. If you go to his house, he'll be there.

20:36.907 --> 20:41.347
Why don't you let me call your mum? No,
miss, please! I just really want Luke here.

20:41.387 --> 20:45.027
I don't know what I'm doing here
without him! Calm down. All right.

20:45.067 --> 20:49.947
All right, I'll... Please. I just really want
him here. I'll see if I can find him, OK?

20:49.987 --> 20:54.747
OK, you're doing very well. Can you
show me where the pain is? Here. OK.

20:54.787 --> 20:59.267
No, no, no, I understand the
concerns, but this is a solid case.

21:00.347 --> 21:03.907
How are we ever gonna get anybody to
come forward if this is what we do?

21:03.947 --> 21:07.187
If every time some arsehole
comes out of the woodwork...

21:09.347 --> 21:11.747
Yeah, sorry. No.

21:11.787 --> 21:14.227
I understand, Sam. Yeah.

21:14.267 --> 21:16.507
OK. Thank you. Cheers. Bye.

21:18.707 --> 21:21.987
Bollocks.

21:22.027 --> 21:24.427
DS Rory Maxwell. Sorry.

21:25.507 --> 21:27.427
Yes, erm...

21:53.467 --> 21:54.907
Hello?

21:54.947 --> 21:57.747
Hi, Miss Nielson,
it's DI Harman here.

21:57.787 --> 21:59.987
"What? What is it?"

22:01.347 --> 22:05.667
Erm... Listen, I'm really sorry,
I've just heard.

22:06.787 --> 22:09.747
"The CPS are declining
to prosecute the case."

22:12.867 --> 22:14.507
Right.

22:16.627 --> 22:19.107
Is this because of
what Dennis Walters said?

22:19.147 --> 22:23.947
I think the truth of the matter is they have
to take the cases they think they can win.

22:23.987 --> 22:28.027
I knew this would happen when that piece
of shit reared his ugly head again.

22:28.067 --> 22:32.187
"I'm really sorry. If I'd had
any say... I mean, I pushed..."

22:32.227 --> 22:34.147
Yeah. Yeah, yeah.
"OK."

22:52.627 --> 22:54.387
Hi, Luke.

22:54.427 --> 22:56.867
What do you want? Dad's not in.

22:57.947 --> 23:00.867
I'm here about Makeda Kidane.
She's in hospital

23:00.907 --> 23:03.787
and she's been asking for you.
Oh, God. Is she all right?

23:03.827 --> 23:08.387
She was in pain at school but she's in the
best place she can be right now. And the baby?

23:08.427 --> 23:12.227
I'm sorry, she took some pills
that caused an abortion.

23:12.267 --> 23:14.387
Come on, I can... I can drive you.

23:16.547 --> 23:21.667
Look, I know what you think of me, but right
now Makeda needs you, so... let's go.

23:22.787 --> 23:25.707
OK, yeah. Let me grab a coat.

23:31.267 --> 23:33.947
Actually,
can I use your bathroom quickly?

23:33.987 --> 23:38.907
Yeah, it's just up on the left.
- Thanks.

24:22.781 --> 24:25.101
Right, let's go.

24:26.421 --> 24:31.061
DI Harman. - Yeah? - Did you look any
further into what I told you about?

24:31.101 --> 24:33.781
About Andrew Earlham?
- Yeah. Not much there to learn.

24:33.821 --> 24:37.821
The cop who looked into the case in
Edinburgh, he thought something was off.

24:37.861 --> 24:42.861
And I spoke to him, but there was no evidence it
was anything other than suicide. It's a dead end.

24:42.901 --> 24:46.541
But it makes a difference, surely.
- No, constable, it doesn't.

24:47.781 --> 24:49.861
Anyway, it's too late.

24:49.901 --> 24:52.621
The CPS won't prosecute the case.

24:53.741 --> 24:58.461
So the prick's just gonna get away with it?
- Unless any new evidence turns up, yeah.

24:59.461 --> 25:01.301
I'm sorry, really.

25:26.061 --> 25:29.181
That's mine.
- No!

25:30.621 --> 25:32.821
That's mine, Ollie!

25:32.861 --> 25:35.101
That's mine, Ollie!

25:35.141 --> 25:37.181
No, it's mine!

25:40.781 --> 25:43.221
That's mine, Ollie!

25:43.261 --> 25:46.381
It's mine, Ollie! It's mine!
- No! Dad!

25:46.421 --> 25:48.781
It's mine, Ollie!

25:48.821 --> 25:50.781
It's mine, Ollie!

26:02.341 --> 26:04.501
Stop. Stop.

26:07.541 --> 26:10.861
Wait here.
- What you doing? What you doing, Tom?

26:12.341 --> 26:15.101
Hey. Excuse me.

26:17.381 --> 26:19.541
Andrew Earlham, right?

26:19.581 --> 26:22.021
Yes, that's right.
Is there a problem?

26:22.061 --> 26:26.341
Yeah. Yeah, there is. So shut your mouth and
listen to me carefully. Can you do that?

26:26.381 --> 26:30.021
Excuse me? I beg your pardon?
You can't talk to me...

26:30.061 --> 26:32.461
I know Laura Nielson.

26:32.501 --> 26:35.821
And I know when she says you
raped her, she's telling the truth.

26:35.861 --> 26:41.661
Look, I... So here's something you need to understand,
you sick bastard. I'm gonna be watching you.

26:41.701 --> 26:45.741
You're not getting away with this. You
might think you have, but you haven't.

26:49.141 --> 26:51.141
Do you hear me?

26:52.901 --> 26:55.061
Have a nice day, sir.

26:56.261 --> 26:58.301
I'd be careful what you say, Tom.

26:59.421 --> 27:01.261
You what?

27:02.821 --> 27:05.701
You think you're some angel
on her shoulder, do you?

27:06.701 --> 27:09.821
Same angel that's been screwing
her sister behind her back?

27:10.821 --> 27:14.981
What are you talking about? You might
wanna have your clandestine meetings

27:15.021 --> 27:20.221
somewhere a little bit more... I don't
know, clandestine... next time.

27:20.261 --> 27:23.941
Instead of right outside
the hospital where we both work.

27:25.421 --> 27:27.461
It's over.

27:27.501 --> 27:29.621
That's what I'm hoping for, Tom.

27:31.341 --> 27:33.341
That it's over.

27:37.341 --> 27:39.581
You have a pleasant day.

27:50.461 --> 27:51.701
Hey.

27:52.741 --> 27:55.101
Hey. I'm sorry.

27:55.141 --> 27:57.821
I'm so sorry.
It's gonna be OK.

27:57.861 --> 28:00.101
No, it's not. It's all messed up.

28:00.141 --> 28:02.661
I got a call from my dad.
He said he's coming here.

28:02.701 --> 28:06.461
He rang the school when I didn't get
home and they told him I was here.

28:06.501 --> 28:08.621
He's on his way.
He's gonna be so angry.

28:08.661 --> 28:12.021
I'm sure your dad will understand,
Makeda, if you explain.

28:12.061 --> 28:14.861
He'll just be pleased that you're OK.
No, he won't.

28:15.901 --> 28:19.261
He sent my sister back home, back
to Ethiopia, for dating someone.

28:19.301 --> 28:22.541
She told me that they hit her.
Jesus.

28:22.581 --> 28:25.781
Does your dad know? She's told him.
He doesn't believe her.

28:26.821 --> 28:29.421
You can't let that happen to me,
miss. Please.

28:29.461 --> 28:34.541
You're over 16, Makeda. The doctors won't tell
your father anything without your permission.

28:34.581 --> 28:37.981
What is he gonna think then?
He's gonna keep asking questions.

28:38.021 --> 28:42.781
If you talk to him, if you tell him that
I fainted from dehydration or something.

28:44.021 --> 28:46.741
You want me to lie to your dad?
He'll believe you.

28:46.781 --> 28:50.541
And then he'll leave me be and all
of this will be fine. Miss, please!

28:50.581 --> 28:54.421
Even if I was prepared to lie to
your father, he's won't listen to me.

28:54.461 --> 28:57.621
By the sounds of it,
he'll want to speak to a doctor.

28:59.661 --> 29:01.861
Luke, your dad.

29:14.221 --> 29:17.061
You need to leave me alone.
- Andrew knows.

29:17.101 --> 29:21.221
What? - I saw him and he told me. He's
seen us together somehow. He knows.

29:22.581 --> 29:25.901
You spoke to him?
Why would you do that?

29:25.941 --> 29:29.941
I dunno, I... I just wanted to
look him in the eye. Jesus Christ!

29:29.981 --> 29:36.061
I was angry. It got my blood going. You'd have made
detective years ago had you learned to keep your temper!

29:36.101 --> 29:38.821
Just be careful what you say to him.
Or what?

29:38.861 --> 29:41.741
Or he'll...
Or he'll tell Laura about us.

29:41.781 --> 29:44.301
He said he wanted to be left alone.

29:44.341 --> 29:48.021
I suggest that's what we do.
I have to go.

30:02.181 --> 30:05.941
Does anyone actually listen
to these things any more?

30:05.981 --> 30:09.181
When was the last time
you heard a car alarm and thought,

30:09.221 --> 30:12.141
"Someone's breaking in,
I better call the police"?

30:15.861 --> 30:17.381
Laura?

30:20.021 --> 30:21.181
Laura.

30:22.181 --> 30:25.461
Oh. I thought maybe
you'd just decided to fall asleep.

30:25.501 --> 30:28.581
Sorry. I'm still looking
for the bloody phone charger.

30:28.621 --> 30:31.341
I found face wipes. Fabulous.

30:31.381 --> 30:34.301
But I can't find the charger.

30:34.341 --> 30:37.781
Oh, don't worry. I'm sure the cab
will show up some point this year.

30:37.821 --> 30:42.021
Er, I give up. Sorry.
You'll have to go another few minutes

30:42.061 --> 30:45.541
without checking your email
or the football score. Very funny.

30:45.581 --> 30:48.741
Ha-ha. What do you say we have
another drink while we wait?

30:48.781 --> 30:50.781
Yeah, sure.

31:22.341 --> 31:25.061
Where is he?
I sent him home.

31:26.541 --> 31:29.461
What? Makeda didn't want her dad
to see him.

31:29.501 --> 31:32.181
If he finds out what's happened...

31:32.221 --> 31:35.781
he'll send her back to Ethiopia
and she can't get sent back there.

31:35.821 --> 31:38.581
Oh, for Christ sake!

31:39.581 --> 31:43.701
How do you even know Makeda's telling the truth?
That girl needs your help.

31:43.741 --> 31:48.021
Talk to her father, tell him it's nothing
to worry about. He'll listen to a doctor.

31:48.061 --> 31:52.301
You want me to lie to her father? Pretend
she didn't give herself an abortion

31:52.341 --> 31:56.501
and almost bleed to death? That's not just
unethical, it's bloody irresponsible!

31:56.541 --> 31:59.861
Telling her father the truth,
what does that accomplish?

31:59.901 --> 32:03.181
She's scared to death of what
will happen if he finds out.

32:03.221 --> 32:07.221
Why do it? What possible reason is there?
Because we feel like we should?

32:07.261 --> 32:09.901
Cos then it's no longer our problem?
Don't you dare!

32:09.941 --> 32:13.581
Both of them got themselves into this.
You owe her! I don't know why...

32:14.581 --> 32:18.461
I think you'll listen, if you have
any kind of conscience to appeal to.

32:18.501 --> 32:23.781
But if you won't do it for Makeda, do it for Luke.
If you care about him, you'll want to protect her.

32:26.861 --> 32:29.821
You see the irony here, right?

32:29.861 --> 32:34.181
After all the lies you've told about
me, you now want... You don't fool me.

32:36.101 --> 32:40.581
Underneath the charm
and the expensive clothes

32:40.621 --> 32:42.901
and the "I'm just a single dad" act,

32:42.941 --> 32:45.141
you're just a predator.

32:45.181 --> 32:47.061
But I'm asking you,

32:47.101 --> 32:50.541
if you have any humanity
in you somewhere,

32:50.581 --> 32:52.981
then do the right thing,
for your son's sake.

32:56.941 --> 32:59.221
I'm not the man
you think I am, Laura.

33:02.021 --> 33:03.981
Really, I'm not

33:34.901 --> 33:36.541
How was bedtime?

33:38.261 --> 33:40.021
Yeah, they're fine.

33:40.061 --> 33:42.421
Sorry I'm late.

33:48.501 --> 33:51.621
Hey. What's going on?

33:51.661 --> 33:54.181
Look, I didn't want this to happen.

33:57.101 --> 34:00.381
What's the matter, Liam?
I don't wanna be the jealous husband

34:00.421 --> 34:04.661
checking through your bloody emails.
Well, why are you checking my emails?

34:06.261 --> 34:12.101
It's just sometimes, you know, when
I'm... when I'm stuck here all day,

34:12.141 --> 34:14.420
and you're at work,

34:14.460 --> 34:16.701
doing something with your life...

34:17.781 --> 34:21.261
coming home late
for the fourth night in a row,

34:21.301 --> 34:23.221
it gets to me.

34:23.261 --> 34:25.261
Why is that?

34:31.021 --> 34:34.261
Liam, I... Look, I didn't read
your emails. I couldn't.

34:37.661 --> 34:40.341
So... I'm just gonna ask you.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.860
And I'm gonna believe what you say.

34:45.221 --> 34:47.501
Are you seeing someone else?

34:51.940 --> 34:53.900
No.

34:54.981 --> 34:56.860
No, I'm not!

34:58.181 --> 35:01.621
Why would you think that? Cos you've
been different, Katy. You have.

35:01.661 --> 35:04.261
I know. You know you have.
I know, I know.

35:04.301 --> 35:07.581
And it's all my fault.
It's just been work and...

35:07.621 --> 35:10.541
and... and I'm stressed

35:10.581 --> 35:14.141
and it's been difficult
and late and...

35:14.181 --> 35:16.581
I just wanna be with you.
That's all.

35:19.101 --> 35:20.661
OK?

35:23.061 --> 35:24.901
You do believe me?

35:27.981 --> 35:29.701
Yeah.

35:29.741 --> 35:30.861
Yeah.

35:32.341 --> 35:34.221
I'm sorry.

35:34.261 --> 35:35.981
I'm sorry.

35:41.781 --> 35:43.581
Good.

35:46.381 --> 35:49.621
Makeda. What happened? Are you OK?

35:49.661 --> 35:52.861
Mr Kidane... What's wrong?
There's nothing to worry about.

35:52.901 --> 35:55.141
She's gonna be just fine.
What do you mean?

35:55.181 --> 35:56.781
Mr Kidane.

35:56.821 --> 35:59.781
Andrew Earlham.
I work here at the hospital.

36:00.781 --> 36:04.581
Makeda here took a bit of a turn
at school and she passed out.

36:04.621 --> 36:08.781
Syncope we call it. But a little blood
test revealed what the culprit was.

36:08.821 --> 36:11.981
Not drinking enough water.
She's gonna be fine.

36:12.021 --> 36:15.101
Lucky Miss Nielson here
was so observant.

36:15.141 --> 36:17.941
Thank you. Thank you, doctor.

36:17.981 --> 36:21.301
Is she all right? Nothing that
a day off school won't fix.

36:22.301 --> 36:25.181
Right, we should get you home,
Makeda. Yes, miss.

36:27.821 --> 36:32.141
Makeda, you have rest. We'll get you
home, you will rest, you will drink.

37:04.301 --> 37:06.141
Mr Earlham.

37:08.581 --> 37:10.781
Detective.

37:10.821 --> 37:14.421
You've probably heard, the CPS
won't be prosecuting your case.

37:15.981 --> 37:17.661
What?

37:17.701 --> 37:19.381
No.

37:19.421 --> 37:21.541
No, I didn't. No-one...

37:23.181 --> 37:25.581
What, that's it? It's over?

37:26.581 --> 37:29.221
Sorry for any inconvenience.

37:29.261 --> 37:30.861
Here.

37:39.021 --> 37:41.181
The meaning of consent?

37:41.221 --> 37:43.301
What is this, some sort of a joke?

37:43.341 --> 37:46.741
I don't want you to be
in a similar situation again, sir.

37:53.421 --> 37:55.461
Well, it's done now, isn't it?

37:55.501 --> 37:59.621
It's finally over. Good night.
Hey, you don't want to...

38:00.861 --> 38:03.621
No.
- What?

38:05.781 --> 38:08.141
You don't wanna come in for a drink,
do you?

38:09.701 --> 38:11.141
Excuse me?

38:12.981 --> 38:17.221
Well, it's been a long day. There's a
place round the corner... I'm on duty.

38:17.261 --> 38:21.061
Well, when are you off?
In about an hour.

38:21.101 --> 38:22.861
How about then?

38:26.181 --> 38:29.301
Well, if I was off duty,

38:29.341 --> 38:31.021
unofficially...

38:32.221 --> 38:35.341
I would tell you I don't drink
with men who rape women.

38:42.141 --> 38:44.941
All right, then.
Good night, detective.

39:12.341 --> 39:15.541
Hello?
- "Oh, hi. It's DI Harman.

39:15.581 --> 39:19.781
Erm, I'm just wondering
if I can have a word.

39:19.821 --> 39:21.821
I'm here at the school."

39:21.861 --> 39:25.101
Right now? - "Yeah, if you can.
I'm at reception."

39:26.141 --> 39:28.741
Er... right, OK.

39:28.781 --> 39:30.941
I'll, erm... I'll come and get you.

39:32.061 --> 39:34.101
Thank you for meeting with me.

39:36.141 --> 39:40.581
It's always a bit weird being back at school.
Feel like I'm about to get told off.

39:40.621 --> 39:42.781
Has there been a change to my case?

39:43.861 --> 39:45.261
No.

39:45.301 --> 39:48.941
Then, sorry, but why are you here?

39:48.981 --> 39:53.221
Because I hate what's happened.
It makes my skin crawl.

39:54.901 --> 39:57.741
And because I wanted to warn you.

39:57.781 --> 40:00.661
What do you mean?
Take a seat.

40:07.181 --> 40:10.661
You know Andrew Earlham's wife
committed suicide?

40:12.181 --> 40:15.021
I'd heard, yeah. Tom told me.

40:16.221 --> 40:19.261
It seems the Edinburgh police
think there was more to it.

40:19.301 --> 40:23.061
Now, I'm only telling you this
because if,

40:23.101 --> 40:26.901
and it is a very big if,

40:26.941 --> 40:30.661
Andrew Earlham had anything
to do with his wife's death,

40:30.701 --> 40:33.421
that makes him a very dangerous man.

40:33.461 --> 40:38.461
And no matter what happens with this case, I strongly
suggest you get a million miles away from him.

40:38.501 --> 40:42.021
I'm guessing you shouldn't be
telling me this. No.

40:42.061 --> 40:43.781
Definitely not.

40:46.781 --> 40:51.501
If there is anything, you call me.
Any time, OK?

40:54.341 --> 40:56.141
OK.

41:02.581 --> 41:05.301
I'm sorry we let you down.

41:14.701 --> 41:15.981
Hey.

41:17.021 --> 41:20.301
Do you want me to make you
something to eat? Oh, no, thanks.

41:21.381 --> 41:23.621
They're dropping the charges,
you know?

41:23.661 --> 41:26.261
That's great.

41:27.341 --> 41:30.381
What? What is it?

41:30.421 --> 41:32.701
It's over.

41:32.741 --> 41:34.901
Is it?

41:34.941 --> 41:36.661
It's just...

41:36.701 --> 41:39.461
It's frustrating.
What she wrote online,

41:39.501 --> 41:42.061
it's out there forever.

41:42.101 --> 41:45.901
It's gonna be hard to shake that off, you know?
And you don't deserve that.

41:47.461 --> 41:49.661
It'll all work out.

41:51.061 --> 41:54.301
Now, come on, get better.

41:55.741 --> 41:57.821
Well, what do you think?

41:59.141 --> 42:04.421
I think you should do what the detective told you.
Keep away from him.

42:04.461 --> 42:08.461
But there's more to it. Just because they
don't have the balls to try this case,

42:08.501 --> 42:12.061
doesn't mean I have to back down.
There must be something I can do.

42:12.101 --> 42:17.421
What if I... speak to someone
at the hospital... Stop! Just stop.

42:18.621 --> 42:23.421
You have to look out for yourself
before he takes any more of you.

42:27.181 --> 42:29.461
I saw him, you know?

42:29.501 --> 42:31.381
What?

42:31.421 --> 42:33.261
When?

42:33.301 --> 42:35.021
What did he say?

42:36.341 --> 42:39.141
He said he wasn't the man
I thought he was.

42:40.741 --> 42:43.941
And it scared me, Katy,
because he believes it.

42:45.141 --> 42:48.541
He honestly, truly believes
that he did nothing wrong.

42:48.581 --> 42:51.261
I kissed him. But that was it.

42:53.941 --> 42:55.541
Just...

42:57.141 --> 43:01.141
I know it isn't easy,
maybe... impossible,

43:01.181 --> 43:03.701
but you just have to try, you...

43:03.741 --> 43:06.501
you have to try to let it go.

43:08.821 --> 43:10.141
Yeah.

43:14.861 --> 43:16.741
How did he leave it?

43:16.781 --> 43:19.341
Did he... say anything else?

43:20.381 --> 43:22.221
No, not really.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.501
It's not that I want to be here.
Never thought I would.

43:27.541 --> 43:30.981
It's usually me on the receiving end
of these things.

43:31.021 --> 43:34.141
Some grieving relative
who thought I could've done more

43:34.181 --> 43:38.101
or thought I couldn't hold a scalpel
straight cos the World Cup was on.

43:41.501 --> 43:44.101
The things people do to each other,
honestly.

43:45.181 --> 43:47.021
The bricks we throw.

43:49.541 --> 43:52.541
Sometimes that's all we've got,
isn't it? Bricks.

43:52.581 --> 43:56.181
This is taking far too long.
It's unacceptable.

43:56.221 --> 43:58.901
I couldn't find the glasses!
And so is this music.

43:58.941 --> 44:01.741
I absolutely hate this song.

44:01.781 --> 44:05.021
I'll go and find something decent
to put on.

44:16.261 --> 44:17.941
Thanks.

44:18.941 --> 44:20.901
Cheers.
Cheers.

44:26.781 --> 44:31.221
Lawsuits for defamation of character
can be a lengthy process.

44:31.261 --> 44:33.221
Oh, I know.

44:33.261 --> 44:38.501
Building my life to what it is today was a lengthy
process. But she took a wrecking ball to that.

44:59.061 --> 45:01.141
And she owes me for that.

45:04.821 --> 45:07.341
She owes me.
