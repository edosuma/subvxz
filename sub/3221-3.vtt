00:06.138 --> 00:07.466
Hey, Dean.

00:07.639 --> 00:09.181
- How long you been back?
- A year.

00:09.349 --> 00:11.009
What you been doing? Hunting.

00:11.184 --> 00:12.928
You've been back this whole time?

00:13.145 --> 00:16.145
You finally had what you wanted.
I wanted my brother alive.

00:16.356 --> 00:17.387
You wanted a family.

00:17.566 --> 00:20.057
You only gave it up
because of the way we lived.

00:20.235 --> 00:22.477
But you had something,
were building something.

00:22.696 --> 00:24.735
I need you to go. You're a hunter.

00:24.906 --> 00:27.397
You know your brother's there.
Things are different.

00:27.576 --> 00:29.449
- You don't wanna be here.
- Yes, I do.

00:29.661 --> 00:33.196
Me and Ben will be here,
and you come when you can.

00:33.373 --> 00:34.784
Just come in one piece.

00:34.958 --> 00:37.283
You think
we could pull something like that off?

00:37.502 --> 00:39.459
It's worth a shot.

00:44.676 --> 00:47.630
Archangels are fierce.
They're absolute.

00:47.804 --> 00:50.046
They're heaven's
most terrifying weapon.

00:50.265 --> 00:52.092
Raphael.

00:52.476 --> 00:54.552
Come and get me, you little bastard.

00:54.728 --> 00:56.270
Castiel?

00:56.480 --> 00:59.231
When the oil burns,
no angel can touch...

00:59.399 --> 01:02.151
or pass through the flames
or he dies.

01:02.360 --> 01:05.895
Castiel, I'm warning you,
do not leave me here.

01:07.449 --> 01:09.488
I will find you.

01:10.577 --> 01:13.613
- What are you gonna do now? Heaven?
- Return to heaven.

01:14.164 --> 01:16.737
With Michael in the cage,
I'm sure it's total anarchy up there.

01:45.320 --> 01:46.435
Oh, come on.

01:59.209 --> 02:00.324
What the hell?

02:01.128 --> 02:03.453
Come on, man, let's get going.

02:11.221 --> 02:12.929
Jerry?

02:15.475 --> 02:18.262
Ed, I think I'm bleeding.

02:54.723 --> 02:56.550
Hey, you.

02:56.975 --> 02:58.884
Hey. Ahem.

04:03.041 --> 04:04.452
Don't stop on my account.

04:04.668 --> 04:06.043
Heh.

04:06.211 --> 04:07.290
I'm done.

04:09.214 --> 04:13.923
Last night was a, ahem, high point,
if you don't mind me saying.

04:14.469 --> 04:16.213
Good.

04:18.180 --> 04:19.805
All right.

04:19.975 --> 04:21.848
Well, I see you need to start your day.

04:22.017 --> 04:24.344
When did you say
you were heading out?

04:26.314 --> 04:28.022
You didn't. Right.

04:31.111 --> 04:33.946
Damn, you know
how to play that mystery card.

04:41.079 --> 04:43.072
Right.

04:46.418 --> 04:47.746
I almost forgot.

04:51.131 --> 04:54.831
Next time,
you can call me on my night off.

04:55.427 --> 04:57.301
If you want.

04:59.848 --> 05:01.556
Okay.

05:03.351 --> 05:05.011
Okay.

05:20.327 --> 05:21.441
<i>- Hey.
- Hey.</i>

05:21.620 --> 05:24.371
<i>- I'm eight hours out of Campbell Base.
- Uh, change of plans.</i>

05:24.581 --> 05:27.072
I need you to meet me.
I'm in PA, town called Easter.

05:28.126 --> 05:30.878
<i>- What are you doing in Pennsylvania?
- Caught a case.</i>

05:31.046 --> 05:32.125
A case?

05:32.339 --> 05:34.960
<i>- When? It's been a day and a half.
- I like to work.</i>

05:35.175 --> 05:36.254
Apparently.

05:37.260 --> 05:39.965
Glad we hashed that out.
Call me when you roll into town.

05:47.354 --> 05:50.023
Who died and made you boss?

06:08.166 --> 06:10.075
Oh, you can do better than that.

06:37.946 --> 06:40.235
Why are you calling me?

06:40.574 --> 06:42.483
He's dead, right? That's it.

06:42.659 --> 06:44.782
Now, I don't wanna talk about it.

06:44.953 --> 06:46.116
We do what we do.

06:46.288 --> 06:49.621
We go to work, we go to the funeral.

06:52.085 --> 06:55.003
Calm down. This has nothing to do
with you and me.

06:55.422 --> 06:58.838
You're just working yourself up.
Don't call me.

06:59.301 --> 07:01.507
Idiot.

07:09.978 --> 07:11.556
God.

07:12.439 --> 07:14.147
God.

07:19.446 --> 07:21.189
Dispatch, this is-Ugh.

07:21.406 --> 07:23.862
<i>- Go ahead.
- Please, I need-</i>

07:24.493 --> 07:25.868
Please.

07:40.383 --> 07:44.084
Ben, I know you're lying.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.552
Because I lie professionally,
that's how.

07:48.225 --> 07:51.676
Now, tell your mom that you broke
the damn thing and take it like a man.

07:51.853 --> 07:55.020
Okay? Okay, okay.

07:55.690 --> 07:57.233
- Wow.
- What?

07:57.400 --> 07:59.559
You, molding the minds of tomorrow.

07:59.736 --> 08:01.859
- Who knew?
- Yeah, tell me about it.

08:02.030 --> 08:03.489
- How did it go?
- With?

08:03.657 --> 08:06.611
You and Lisa.
How did she take it when you bailed?

08:06.785 --> 08:08.113
Shockingly cool, actually.

08:09.704 --> 08:11.614
Better for everybody.

08:12.666 --> 08:14.160
Yeah, I suppose.

08:14.376 --> 08:16.748
Still driving the plastic
piece of crap, huh?

08:16.920 --> 08:19.043
- What's your mileage again?
- Shut up.

08:22.175 --> 08:23.800
All right, look.

08:27.681 --> 08:29.839
Officer Gerald Hatch,
a 17-year veteran.

08:30.016 --> 08:31.808
Found dead in the ready room
three days ago.

08:31.977 --> 08:34.549
Whoa. Somebody was over-hydrating.

08:35.063 --> 08:38.681
Heh. Basically, yeah.
Guy just liquefied.

08:38.859 --> 08:43.520
Most of the meat, bones, dense tissues,
they just turned to blood.

08:43.697 --> 08:45.736
- Okay, I don't get it.
- Nobody gets it.

08:45.907 --> 08:47.532
No, I mean, I get that.

08:47.701 --> 08:50.488
If the guy was a mop job,
what are we doing in the morgue?

08:50.662 --> 08:53.782
- What's left of him to look at?
- Not here to look at him.

08:57.627 --> 08:59.205
Here.

09:04.509 --> 09:05.838
Ooh.

09:06.011 --> 09:07.802
- Bad news.
- Officer Toby Gray.

09:07.971 --> 09:09.679
They just brought him in.

09:09.848 --> 09:13.513
Found him dead in his patrol car
at a speed trap on the outside of town.

09:13.727 --> 09:15.221
Extreme allergic reaction.

09:15.437 --> 09:18.106
- Boils, covered from head to toe.
- On the inside too.

09:18.315 --> 09:21.766
His airways are chock-full of them.
Starting to look witch-y to you?

09:21.943 --> 09:25.562
That was my first instinct, but I've
found zero signs of hex work anywhere.

09:25.739 --> 09:27.981
Far as I can tell,
witchcraft was not involved.

09:28.158 --> 09:31.527
Gotta be some sort of link between,
uh, Skidmark and Bubblewrap here.

09:31.745 --> 09:33.702
- No question.
- Well, can I get a witness?

09:33.872 --> 09:35.366
Yep. Uh...

09:35.540 --> 09:37.912
"Officer Ed Colfax."

09:38.084 --> 09:40.207
Saw Hatch go from a solid to a liquid.

09:40.712 --> 09:43.713
- Another cop?
- Hatch's partner.

10:06.571 --> 10:08.564
Were you, uh-?

10:09.199 --> 10:12.034
Heh, were you racing me?

10:12.202 --> 10:14.444
No. I was kicking your ass.

10:14.621 --> 10:15.819
Very mature.

10:17.541 --> 10:21.788
Hello? Officer Colfax? Whoa.

10:22.295 --> 10:23.624
Looking sharp, Kojak.

10:23.839 --> 10:25.119
Who the hell are you?

10:26.174 --> 10:31.169
We're the Fed, Ed, here to ask you
questions about your partner's death.

10:31.346 --> 10:33.552
Don't worry about it.
It's nobody's business.

10:33.723 --> 10:36.511
- Officer Colfax-
- Don't worry about it.

10:41.523 --> 10:43.101
Dude.

10:56.246 --> 10:58.452
Officer Colfax?

11:00.959 --> 11:05.004
- Hey, man, you all right?
- Don't worry about it.

11:05.380 --> 11:06.922
Right.

11:07.090 --> 11:09.961
Look, Officer Colfax, Ed, uh...

11:10.177 --> 11:14.637
we think that your partner died
of unnatural causes.

11:17.350 --> 11:19.094
Did he have any enemies
that you know of?

11:19.269 --> 11:22.720
- Unh. You might say that.
- Oh, yeah?

11:22.898 --> 11:26.101
- Who's that?
- They both had it coming.

11:26.318 --> 11:28.145
Me too.

11:28.320 --> 11:31.570
I'll be the next to go,
and then it'll be over.

11:34.117 --> 11:36.952
And God will be satisfied.

11:37.162 --> 11:39.320
Why does God want you all dead?

11:39.706 --> 11:41.366
Because of Christopher Birch.

11:43.293 --> 11:44.621
Oh, damn it.

11:45.045 --> 11:47.832
- Who's Christopher Birch?
- He has no face.

11:51.384 --> 11:52.879
Ed?

11:54.471 --> 11:56.463
Officer, are you all right?

11:57.849 --> 11:59.842
Who is Christopher Birch, Ed?

12:01.436 --> 12:03.228
Ed.

12:03.897 --> 12:06.020
Christopher Birch
is a kid with no face.

12:07.400 --> 12:09.523
And a planted gun.

12:13.073 --> 12:15.694
Uh. You, uh-

12:15.867 --> 12:17.361
You got a little something.

12:17.577 --> 12:19.036
Yeah.

12:19.746 --> 12:21.205
Damn.

12:21.373 --> 12:23.365
My head's been itching
like a dirty jock.

12:27.796 --> 12:29.076
Ed?

12:40.183 --> 12:41.808
Dead.

12:45.480 --> 12:47.272
You hear that?

13:04.958 --> 13:08.042
Sweet. Blood, boils, locusts.

13:08.211 --> 13:11.378
Three of your more popular
Egyptian plagues.

13:11.548 --> 13:16.044
Yeah, but these guys
ate their way out of a cop's melon.

13:16.219 --> 13:18.378
I don't quite remember that
in the King James.

13:18.555 --> 13:20.595
Meanwhile,
a kid named Christopher Birch...

13:20.766 --> 13:23.683
was shot in the head last month
after a vehicle pursuit.

13:23.852 --> 13:26.343
Hatch, Gray, and Colfax
were the officers involved...

13:26.521 --> 13:28.478
and they filed
the same police report.

13:28.648 --> 13:30.807
"Suspect exited vehicle
brandishing a firearm.

13:30.984 --> 13:33.356
We were forced to fire."

13:33.945 --> 13:37.149
Just a kid with no face
and a planted gun.

13:37.741 --> 13:39.568
Bunch of dicks.

13:39.743 --> 13:41.735
So they popped the kid,
planted the piece.

13:43.121 --> 13:44.746
Maybe Colfax is right.

13:45.373 --> 13:47.580
Maybe heaven has a hate on
for bad cops.

13:48.043 --> 13:51.791
So we're listening to the guy
with the bug in his custard?

13:51.963 --> 13:54.501
That's the, uh,
theory you wanna go with?

13:54.674 --> 13:57.248
Dean, angels gotta have
something to do, right?

13:57.427 --> 13:59.716
Now that we're post-apocalypse.

13:59.888 --> 14:01.715
Maybe.

14:02.307 --> 14:04.430
You should call Cass.

14:05.477 --> 14:06.556
You're kidding, right?

14:09.856 --> 14:12.145
Dean, I tried.

14:12.317 --> 14:15.935
It was the first, and second
and third thing I did...

14:16.113 --> 14:17.311
soon as I got topside.

14:17.531 --> 14:19.819
Son of a bitch
won't answer the phone.

14:20.450 --> 14:22.490
Well, let's give it a shot.

14:23.286 --> 14:24.697
Now I lay me down to sleep...

14:24.871 --> 14:29.035
I pray to Castiel
to get his feathery ass down here.

14:29.251 --> 14:30.330
You're an idiot.

14:30.502 --> 14:32.578
- Stay positive.
- Oh, I am positive.

14:35.173 --> 14:37.960
Come on, Cass, don't be a dick.

14:39.553 --> 14:45.342
Got ourselves
a plague-like situation down here and...

14:46.643 --> 14:47.758
Do you-?

14:47.936 --> 14:49.845
Do you copy?

14:57.821 --> 15:03.325
Like I said, ahem,
the son of a bitch doesn't answer.

15:08.248 --> 15:09.873
He's right behind me, isn't he?

15:14.713 --> 15:16.255
Hello.

15:20.843 --> 15:23.168
- Hello?
- Yes.

15:25.264 --> 15:28.680
Hello. Hello?

15:28.976 --> 15:31.218
Uh, that is still the term?

15:31.395 --> 15:33.851
I spend all that time
trying to get through to you.

15:34.023 --> 15:37.189
- Dean calls once and now it's hello?
- Yes.

15:39.195 --> 15:43.323
So, what,
you like him better or something?

15:44.950 --> 15:48.651
Dean and I do share
a more profound bond.

15:49.330 --> 15:50.575
I wasn't gonna mention it.

15:50.748 --> 15:54.828
Cass, I think what he's trying to say
is that he went to hell for us.

15:55.002 --> 15:57.291
He really took one for the team,
remember that?

15:57.505 --> 15:59.746
And then he comes back
without a clue...

15:59.965 --> 16:02.337
you can't take five minutes
to give answers?

16:02.551 --> 16:05.885
If I had any answers, I might
have responded, but I don't know, Sam.

16:06.096 --> 16:10.390
We have no idea who brought you back
from the cage or why.

16:11.477 --> 16:14.229
So it wasn't God?

16:14.396 --> 16:15.511
No one's even seen God.

16:16.857 --> 16:20.191
- The whole thing remains mysterious.
- What does that mean?

16:20.903 --> 16:25.481
What part of "I don't know"
escapes your understanding?

16:27.034 --> 16:30.237
Cass, look, if Sam calls, you answer.

16:30.454 --> 16:33.704
Okay? You wing your ass down here
and you tell him, "I don't know."

16:33.874 --> 16:36.661
Just because we have some sort
of a bond or whatever-

16:36.877 --> 16:39.629
You think I came because you called.

16:39.839 --> 16:41.167
I came because of this.

16:43.259 --> 16:46.628
- Well, it's nice to know what matters.
- It does help one to focus.

16:47.179 --> 16:50.465
Wait, so you and the Halo Patrol
aren't the cause of these killings?

16:50.683 --> 16:53.886
No. But they were committed
with one of our weapons.

16:54.103 --> 16:57.554
There's only one thing that could have
brought this into existence.

16:57.731 --> 16:59.391
You call it the staff of Moses.

17:02.236 --> 17:03.315
The staff?

17:04.155 --> 17:08.401
It was used in a dominance display
against the Egyptians, as I recall.

17:08.576 --> 17:10.449
Yeah, that one made the papers.

17:10.618 --> 17:17.073
Well, I thought the staff turned, like,
a river into blood, not one dude.

17:17.251 --> 17:20.371
The weapon
isn't being used at full capacity.

17:21.755 --> 17:24.080
I think we can rule Moses out
as a suspect.

17:26.093 --> 17:31.218
Okay, well, what is Chuck Heston's
disco stick doing down here anyway?

17:31.432 --> 17:33.721
I mean, don't you guys
put away your toys?

17:34.518 --> 17:37.270
Before the apocalypse,
heaven may have been corrupt...

17:37.438 --> 17:38.980
but it was stable.

17:39.148 --> 17:41.935
The staff was safely contained.

17:43.402 --> 17:46.736
It's been chaos up there
since the war ended.

17:46.947 --> 17:52.867
In that confusion, a number
of powerful weapons were stolen.

17:53.245 --> 17:56.863
Wait, you're saying
your nukes are loose?

17:57.374 --> 17:59.414
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

17:59.960 --> 18:02.712
But you've stumbled
onto one of them.

18:02.922 --> 18:05.294
We must find the weapon
that did this.

18:08.010 --> 18:09.041
I need your help.

18:12.431 --> 18:14.091
That's rich, really.

18:17.603 --> 18:22.312
Sam, Dean,
my "people skills" are "rusty."

18:22.525 --> 18:24.019
I have spent the last "year"...

18:24.193 --> 18:27.063
as a multidimensional wavelength
of celestial intent.

18:27.238 --> 18:30.274
But believe me, you do not want
that weapon down here.

18:31.283 --> 18:35.198
Help me find it,
or more people will die.

18:36.372 --> 18:37.451
All right, okay.

18:37.623 --> 18:42.084
Well, if the angels didn't pull the trigger,
then that brings us back to motive.

18:42.253 --> 18:45.040
- What?
- Back to the case.

18:46.966 --> 18:48.839
And now we got three dead cops.

18:49.009 --> 18:54.348
Only thing linking them is this.

18:54.515 --> 18:58.643
"Father of slain suspect
calls for investigation."

19:11.490 --> 19:14.325
Come on, Dad, how many times
are you gonna read that thing?

19:15.619 --> 19:16.699
You know what?

19:16.871 --> 19:19.362
- We should just throw it away.
- Go out back and play.

19:27.339 --> 19:29.830
- Cass, a little warning next time.
- How'd you get in?

19:30.009 --> 19:33.591
Mr. Birch, settle down.
Federal agents.

19:33.804 --> 19:37.505
- But you can't just walk in here.
- Quite a collection you got there, huh?

19:38.601 --> 19:41.602
- What are you trying to-?
- Look, we know the truth, all right?

19:41.770 --> 19:44.440
Chris didn't have a gun on him
when those cops shot him.

19:44.607 --> 19:47.442
- They set him up.
- Yeah.

19:47.610 --> 19:49.234
They're all getting theirs.

19:49.445 --> 19:51.651
And who's giving it to them, Darryl?

19:52.406 --> 19:55.656
Darryl, did you kill Toby Gray
and the others?

19:55.826 --> 19:58.400
Me? I didn't kill anyone.
Look at how they died.

19:58.621 --> 20:00.660
You smote them
with the staff of Moses.

20:01.624 --> 20:03.830
What the hell kind of Fed are you?

20:04.001 --> 20:06.290
We don't have time for this.

20:06.629 --> 20:08.337
Where is it? Leave my dad alone.

20:11.175 --> 20:12.634
- Is that-?
- Yes.

20:12.843 --> 20:15.168
Shouldn't it be bigger?
Yes, it's-

20:15.387 --> 20:17.878
- Been sawed off.
- Leave him alone, it wasn't him.

20:18.098 --> 20:20.008
Aaron, get out of here.

20:22.645 --> 20:25.764
What did you do to him?
He's all right, he's just sleeping.

20:28.943 --> 20:30.105
Cass, take it easy.

20:31.570 --> 20:34.607
Listen, we're not here
to hurt you, okay?

20:34.782 --> 20:38.862
But we need to know.
Where did you get this thing?

20:40.454 --> 20:42.281
Please don't kill my dad.

20:42.498 --> 20:43.696
It was me. I did it.

20:43.874 --> 20:46.033
Okay, nobody's killing anybody.

20:46.210 --> 20:47.788
What's your name?

20:48.170 --> 20:49.962
Aaron. Aaron Birch.

20:50.131 --> 20:52.668
Okay, Aaron Birch,
where did you get this?

20:52.883 --> 20:54.710
- You won't believe me.
- Try me.

20:56.720 --> 20:58.630
It was an angel.

20:59.890 --> 21:00.969
An angel?

21:01.183 --> 21:05.181
Those liars, they killed my brother
and nothing bad even happened to them.

21:05.729 --> 21:07.521
It's not fair.

21:08.357 --> 21:11.026
So I prayed to God every night
he would punish them.

21:11.235 --> 21:14.734
God didn't answer, but he did.

21:14.947 --> 21:16.738
His name. Did he give you a name?

21:17.241 --> 21:20.574
No. He just said I could have justice.

21:20.744 --> 21:22.654
But I was gonna have
to take it myself.

21:23.706 --> 21:26.742
He gave me the stick.

21:28.002 --> 21:29.710
He just gave it to you?

21:32.590 --> 21:34.547
Come on.

21:34.717 --> 21:38.845
He didn't just give it to you,
did he, Aaron?

21:41.849 --> 21:43.925
I bought it.

21:44.351 --> 21:45.466
You bought it? Heh.

21:46.687 --> 21:49.890
With what? What's your allowance?

21:50.065 --> 21:51.773
What did the angel want for it?

21:51.984 --> 21:53.443
What did you give him for it?

21:55.988 --> 21:57.151
My soul.

22:02.328 --> 22:04.949
You sold your soul to an angel?

22:05.789 --> 22:08.459
- Can that even happen?
- It's never happened before.

22:09.752 --> 22:14.046
An angel's buying souls. That could
explain why he cut the staff into pieces.

22:14.465 --> 22:15.627
Why?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.551
More pieces, more product.
More product?

22:18.761 --> 22:21.797
- Who is this guy?
- We'll find him.

22:23.182 --> 22:26.017
- What did you do that for?
- Portability.

22:30.397 --> 22:32.307
Cass, you realize
you just kidnapped a kid.

22:32.483 --> 22:35.152
If the angel we seek
truly bought this boy's soul

22:35.319 --> 22:38.818
When a claim is laid on a living soul,
it leaves a mark, a brand.

22:39.406 --> 22:41.732
What, like a shirt tag at camp?

22:43.285 --> 22:44.863
I have no idea.

22:45.037 --> 22:46.282
But I can read the mark...

22:46.455 --> 22:49.077
and find the name of the angel
that bought the soul.

22:49.250 --> 22:51.622
- How?
- Well, painfully, for him.

22:52.586 --> 22:54.211
The reading will be excruciating.

22:54.380 --> 22:55.625
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

22:55.840 --> 22:58.461
- Dean.
- He's a kid, Cass, a ki-

22:58.634 --> 23:00.045
Sam.

23:02.972 --> 23:04.382
- Any permanent damage?
- What?

23:04.557 --> 23:05.837
Physically, minimal.

23:06.058 --> 23:08.383
Then by all means,
stick your arm right in there.

23:08.561 --> 23:11.846
Dean, if I get the name I can work
a ritual to track the angel down.

23:12.022 --> 23:13.398
I'm for that, but come on.

23:13.607 --> 23:16.478
- There's gotta be another way.
- There is no other way.

23:18.195 --> 23:21.896
- You're gonna torture a kid.
- I can't care about that, Dean.

23:24.535 --> 23:26.326
I don't have the luxury.

24:06.202 --> 24:07.233
He'll rest now.

24:08.746 --> 24:11.153
Did you get a name? What is it?

24:11.457 --> 24:14.030
I thought he died in the war.

24:14.877 --> 24:18.246
What, he was a friend or something?

24:18.881 --> 24:20.209
A good friend.

24:20.424 --> 24:23.259
Your frat buddy is now moonlighting
as a crossroads demon.

24:23.803 --> 24:24.917
Balthazar, I wonder.

24:25.095 --> 24:27.503
So we can find him now, right?
Balthazar.

24:27.681 --> 24:30.219
Thanks, Castiel,
we'll make good use of the name.

24:36.524 --> 24:38.232
And by the way, Raphael says hello.

25:25.948 --> 25:27.691
My car.

25:30.286 --> 25:32.777
Okay. Silver lining.

25:40.961 --> 25:42.669
He's gone.

25:44.840 --> 25:46.797
All right, Cass, who was that guy?

25:46.967 --> 25:48.129
A soldier of Raphael.

25:48.885 --> 25:51.459
He must have followed me
when I answered your call.

25:51.638 --> 25:53.631
Raphael? The archangel?

25:55.934 --> 25:59.386
- I'm sorry, what's going on here?
- I can explain later.

25:59.563 --> 26:01.805
- Right now, we have to-
- No, not later, now.

26:01.982 --> 26:04.555
Stop, all right?
There's too many angels, Cass.

26:04.735 --> 26:06.976
I don't know who's on first,
what's on second-

26:07.154 --> 26:09.479
- What is second?
- Don't start that.

26:09.656 --> 26:12.028
It is simple,
Raphael and his followers...

26:12.242 --> 26:13.784
they want him to rule heaven.

26:13.952 --> 26:17.820
I and many others, the last thing
we want is to let him take over.

26:18.498 --> 26:20.041
It would be catastrophic.

26:21.209 --> 26:22.869
You're talking civil war.

26:23.879 --> 26:25.539
Technically, yes.

26:25.714 --> 26:30.376
Which is why we have to find Balthazar
and his weapons before Raphael does.

26:31.094 --> 26:33.668
Whoever has the weapons
wins the war.

26:34.181 --> 26:36.636
- Help yourself.
- What happens if Raphael wins?

26:36.850 --> 26:38.095
I mean, what does he want?

26:38.268 --> 26:40.510
To end the story
the way it was written.

26:40.729 --> 26:44.098
The apocalypse, the one we derailed?
Yes, that one.

26:44.483 --> 26:46.725
Raphael wants to put it back
on the rails.

26:48.904 --> 26:50.398
Why?

26:50.572 --> 26:52.731
- I need myrrh.
- Myrrh?

26:54.701 --> 26:56.908
Frigging angels.

26:58.580 --> 27:01.071
Why does Raphael
wanna bring back all this crap?

27:01.249 --> 27:02.909
He's a traditionalist.

27:03.752 --> 27:05.163
Why didn't you tell us this?

27:07.297 --> 27:08.791
I was ashamed.

27:11.760 --> 27:13.753
I expected more from my brothers.

27:18.433 --> 27:20.225
I'm sorry.

27:22.020 --> 27:25.140
- Now I need your blood.
- Whoa, whoa, hey. Agh!

27:25.315 --> 27:28.980
- Why don't you use your own?
- Wouldn't work, I'm not human.

27:30.028 --> 27:31.606
Ugh.

27:51.174 --> 27:54.508
Uh, Cass, how long
does this spell take?

28:00.058 --> 28:03.427
- Got him, let's go.
- Whoa, whoa, wait, what about him?

28:05.689 --> 28:07.895
Don't you think the police
will take him home?

28:17.284 --> 28:18.363
Huh.

28:18.535 --> 28:21.489
I was expecting more Dr. No,
less Liberace.

29:18.971 --> 29:20.928
Cass.

29:21.682 --> 29:23.555
You're here.

29:26.186 --> 29:28.938
- Balthazar.
- It's so good to see you.

29:29.106 --> 29:32.640
- He told me you were floating around.
- He?

29:33.819 --> 29:36.938
I believe you two have flown together.
Ha-ha-ha.

29:38.782 --> 29:41.818
Well, you know,
the old frog in the throat.

29:45.831 --> 29:48.238
Even I know that's a bad joke.

29:50.335 --> 29:51.414
I grieved your death.

29:51.628 --> 29:53.668
Yeah, yeah,
I'm sorry about that, you know.

29:53.839 --> 29:57.421
I wanted them to think, you know,
so they wouldn't come looking for me.

29:57.592 --> 29:59.799
What is all this?

29:59.970 --> 30:01.761
- What are you doing?
- Whatever I want.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.887
This morning I had a ménage a'-

30:04.057 --> 30:05.172
What's French for 12?

30:05.684 --> 30:07.641
You stole the staff of Moses.

30:07.853 --> 30:10.095
Sure, sure.

30:10.272 --> 30:12.561
I stole a lot of things.

30:12.733 --> 30:15.734
You were a great
and honorable soldier.

30:15.902 --> 30:17.527
We fought together.

30:17.696 --> 30:20.104
Yes, too many times to count.

30:20.282 --> 30:22.773
I know you.
You're not some common thief.

30:22.951 --> 30:24.410
Common? No.

30:24.578 --> 30:26.736
Thief? Eh.

30:27.622 --> 30:30.908
- I need your help.
- I know, I've been hearing all about you.

30:31.084 --> 30:35.580
And as far as I'm concerned,
you and me, Cass, nothing's changed.

30:35.797 --> 30:36.877
We're brothers.

30:37.049 --> 30:39.088
- Of course I wanna help you.
- Thank you.

30:41.136 --> 30:43.757
- I need the weapons.
- Don't ask that.

30:43.972 --> 30:45.301
Why take them? Why run away?

30:45.515 --> 30:46.844
Because I could.

30:48.018 --> 30:49.133
What?

30:49.311 --> 30:51.849
What? I mean, you're the one
who made it possible.

30:52.064 --> 30:54.436
The footsteps I'm following,
they're yours.

30:54.650 --> 30:59.146
What you did,
stopping the big plan, the prize fight.

30:59.321 --> 31:00.945
You did more than rebel.

31:01.156 --> 31:04.276
You tore up the whole script
and burned the pages for all of us.

31:07.162 --> 31:09.071
It's a new era.

31:09.289 --> 31:11.116
No rules. No destiny.

31:11.291 --> 31:14.826
Just utter and complete freedom.

31:15.003 --> 31:16.545
And this is what you do with it?

31:16.713 --> 31:20.165
Hey, screw it, right?
I mean, dad's not coming back.

31:20.634 --> 31:23.469
You might as well blow coke
and jump on the bed.

31:23.887 --> 31:29.972
You proved to me we could do anything,
so I'm trying everything.

31:30.143 --> 31:33.393
- What difference does it make?
- Of course it makes a diff-

31:33.563 --> 31:35.473
- It's civil war up there.
- I know.

31:35.649 --> 31:39.148
If we can beat Raphael,
we can end this.

31:39.319 --> 31:40.979
- Just give me the weapons.
- Ha, ha.

31:41.154 --> 31:42.814
Do you know
what's funny about you?

31:42.990 --> 31:45.860
You actually believe
that you can stop the fighting.

31:47.869 --> 31:51.535
It will never stop.

31:52.207 --> 31:55.623
My advice, grab something valuable
and fake your own death.

31:57.713 --> 31:59.789
You've gone insane.

32:01.883 --> 32:05.383
Your little holiday is over.
Raphael knows you're alive by now.

32:05.554 --> 32:08.175
Oh, Raphael can try me anytime.

32:08.348 --> 32:09.677
I'm armed.

32:10.100 --> 32:11.179
I'm sorry, Cass.

32:11.351 --> 32:14.222
All else aside,
I'm really, really happy to see you.

32:14.396 --> 32:16.602
Even though
you still have that stick up your ass.

32:20.527 --> 32:22.603
Was that you?

32:22.821 --> 32:24.446
Oh, that's my cue, then.

32:24.614 --> 32:27.284
Tell, uh, Raphael to bite me.

32:40.828 --> 32:44.078
Watch them. They're all snakes.

32:54.175 --> 32:55.799
Hey there.

32:56.552 --> 32:58.591
Yeah. I got one of those too.

32:59.972 --> 33:02.926
- You think you can knife fight an angel?
- Who's fighting?

33:03.142 --> 33:05.099
Peace out, douchewad.

33:17.656 --> 33:18.819
You're making a mistake.

33:19.283 --> 33:20.943
Please, there is another way.

33:21.160 --> 33:23.318
Brother, please,
I don't wanna hurt you.

33:32.421 --> 33:34.378
Why won't any of you listen?

33:35.090 --> 33:39.219
They don't listen, Castiel,
because their hearts are mine.

34:19.260 --> 34:22.842
Somehow, I don't think God
will be bringing you back this time.

34:23.054 --> 34:24.597
Hey.

34:25.266 --> 34:26.545
Look at my junk.

34:28.268 --> 34:29.726
No.

34:44.827 --> 34:46.487
Same thing happened to Lot's wife.

34:46.661 --> 34:51.489
Iodize the poor sucker and your
kitchen is stocked for life. Ha, ha.

34:51.917 --> 34:53.032
You came back.

34:53.252 --> 34:56.668
Well, now Raphael will have
to go shopping for a new vessel.

34:56.880 --> 34:59.206
Should give me
a nice long head start on him.

35:00.676 --> 35:03.381
- Until next time.
- Next time?

35:05.347 --> 35:07.007
No time like the present.

35:11.145 --> 35:12.390
Holy Fire.

35:12.605 --> 35:15.522
You hairless ape. Release me.

35:15.733 --> 35:18.438
First, you're taking your marker
off Aaron Birch's soul.

35:18.611 --> 35:20.235
- Am I?
- Sam.

35:20.446 --> 35:24.574
Unless you like your wings extra-crispy,
I'd think about it.

35:25.576 --> 35:28.447
Castiel, I stood for you in heaven.

35:28.621 --> 35:32.405
- Are you gonna let one of them-?
- I believe the hairless ape has the floor.

35:37.463 --> 35:40.464
Ha-ha-ha. Very well.

35:51.393 --> 35:54.597
The boy's debt is cleared.
His soul is his own.

35:54.772 --> 35:57.345
- Why are you buying up human souls?
- In this economy?

35:57.566 --> 35:59.689
It's probably the only thing
worth buying.

36:00.361 --> 36:03.315
Do you have any idea
what souls are worth?

36:03.489 --> 36:04.817
What power they hold?

36:08.452 --> 36:11.204
Now, release me.

36:12.873 --> 36:14.866
Suck it, ass clown,
nobody said anything-

36:19.213 --> 36:22.000
- Cass, what the hell?
- My debt to you is cleared.

36:22.967 --> 36:24.046
Fair enough.

36:26.804 --> 36:29.342
Cass, are you out of your mind?

36:31.142 --> 36:33.015
Cass?

36:35.146 --> 36:38.146
Oh, frigging angels. Come on.

36:43.319 --> 36:45.940
Gosh, I didn't realize
I had this much stuff back here.

36:46.155 --> 36:47.899
Well, ahem, I need some space.

36:48.116 --> 36:50.192
Kind of picked up some stuff
along the way.

36:54.455 --> 36:55.949
What the hell is that?

36:56.124 --> 36:58.745
Oh, that's, uh,
Ben's Halloween costume.

37:00.711 --> 37:03.582
- Wendigo?
- Yeah.

37:03.756 --> 37:05.381
Accurate.

37:10.304 --> 37:12.131
Hey, so, uh...

37:13.850 --> 37:17.265
- Are you okay?
- Me?

37:18.104 --> 37:19.432
Yeah, I'm great.

37:21.274 --> 37:24.524
Really? Because there's been
a few times you got me wondering.

37:25.611 --> 37:28.778
- Come again?
- Well, like where were you when Cass...

37:28.948 --> 37:31.902
was giving the holy-Taser treatment
to that kid?

37:33.369 --> 37:35.243
I was right there.

37:35.413 --> 37:39.493
Really? Because, honestly, I felt
like I was the only one raising a card.

37:40.126 --> 37:43.542
Right. I mean, I was with you.

37:43.713 --> 37:47.248
But, I don't know,
we needed the intel.

37:47.467 --> 37:50.337
Yeah, I know,
but we tortured that kid to get it.

37:51.471 --> 37:54.471
I just didn't get the feeling
that you even cared.

37:58.436 --> 37:59.634
You're wrong.

38:02.899 --> 38:07.359
I mean, I'm just trying to figure this out,
because something's different with you.

38:07.570 --> 38:10.737
- You know that.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

38:10.907 --> 38:14.655
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean...

38:16.370 --> 38:20.831
I've been hunting nonstop
for the past year.

38:21.000 --> 38:24.250
Kind of out in the wild, you know?

38:24.462 --> 38:28.542
So yeah, I suppose
I'm a little rough around the edges.

38:29.550 --> 38:31.673
Yeah, I get that.

38:33.137 --> 38:36.008
But I just don't think
I'm getting the whole scoop.

38:36.974 --> 38:38.350
You went to hell, Sam.

38:38.935 --> 38:41.805
And believe me,
I know what that does to a guy.

38:41.979 --> 38:44.055
- To you.
- What?

38:44.232 --> 38:45.856
You know what it does to you.

38:46.067 --> 38:50.859
It tortured you, you know?

38:51.030 --> 38:52.987
I think it still does.

38:53.199 --> 38:57.742
But, Dean, heh, I'm okay.

38:58.579 --> 39:01.450
So you're saying, what,
that you're stronger than me?

39:01.624 --> 39:04.993
No. I'm just saying we're different.

39:38.327 --> 39:40.119
Monsters lately.

39:40.288 --> 39:41.912
Is it me, or is it weird?

39:49.046 --> 39:50.161
Vampires?

39:50.715 --> 39:53.965
These aren't vampires, man, these...

39:54.552 --> 39:55.666
These are douchebags.

40:02.601 --> 40:06.267
- Explain to me what's going on.
- I can't bring this crap home to you.

40:06.480 --> 40:08.853
- Your work.
- I'm talking about my life.

40:10.484 --> 40:14.316
Anyone in town who asks aloud
for the truth invokes Veritas.

40:14.530 --> 40:17.021
She doesn't give it to you,
she slams you with it.

40:17.241 --> 40:20.325
- Why the hell am I telling you this?
- Because I'm cursed.

40:20.536 --> 40:24.201
Sam, I asked for the truth,
and, uh, guess what, I'm getting it.

40:24.415 --> 40:26.372
So like I said,
I have questions for you.

40:26.542 --> 40:29.033
- Dean, are you all right?
- It's Sam, Bobby.

40:30.379 --> 40:32.123
You got my back.

40:32.298 --> 40:35.465
No matter what happens, I can always
count on you, right, Sammy?

40:36.302 --> 40:39.137
Yeah. Of course, Dean.
