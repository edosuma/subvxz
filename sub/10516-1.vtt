INTO A MINDLESS MINION

24:44.600 --> 24:46.440
AND THEN WHEN THE GIRL
FALLS FOR HIM,

24:46.440 --> 24:47.960
HE TAKES HER HOME,

24:47.960 --> 24:48.960
PUTS HER IN A TRANCE,

24:48.960 --> 24:50.320

24:52.120 --> 24:53.120

ONE THING I KNOW,

34:48.040 --> 34:50.240
IT'S PEOPLE.

34:50.280 --> 34:54.080
WELL, YOU DON'T KNOW ME.
WE JUST MET.

34:54.120 --> 34:55.360
NO, THAT'S TRUE.

34:55.400 --> 34:58.600
WELL, MAYBE I DON'T
KNOW WHO YOU ARE,

34:58.640 --> 35:01.000
BUT I DO KNOW
WHO YOU COULD BE.

35:01.040 --> 35:03.800
AND MAYBE,
JUST MAYBE,

35:03.840 --> 35:05.920
THAT'S WHAT TONIGHT
IS ALL ABOUT.

35:06.000 --> 35:08.240
MAYBE!

35:23.600 --> 35:25.960
YOU KNOW, IF THIS
HAD HAPPENED NEXT SUMMER,

35:26.000 --> 35:27.200
I COULD HAVE DRIVEN.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.520
YEAH, WELL,
IT DIDN'T.

35:28.560 --> 35:30.200
COME ON, WE'RE
ALMOST THERE,
ALL RIGHT?

35:47.440 --> 35:49.600
MAY I INTEREST YOU
IN A BOTTLE OF WINE?

35:49.600 --> 35:51.320
I DON'T
DRINK...WINE.

35:51.360 --> 35:53.680
I THINK
WE'LL JUST STICK
WITH WATER FOR NOW.

35:53.720 --> 35:54.800
PERHAPS
SOME GARLIC BREAD--

35:54.880 --> 35:57.120
NO! THANK YOU.

36:03.280 --> 36:05.520
THERE HE IS!
COME ON.

36:18.240 --> 36:20.480
Chelsea:
WHAT IS WITH YOU?

36:20.480 --> 36:21.680
I'M NOT GOING
TO LET DIMITRI

36:21.720 --> 36:24.000
TURN MOM INTO AN ONION.

36:24.040 --> 36:25.920
A MINION! I TOLD HIM
THAT VAMPIRES
TURN PEOPLE

36:25.960 --> 36:28.680
INTO<i> MINIONS</i>
OF THE UNDEAD.

36:28.720 --> 36:31.160
WHY AM I NOT
SURPRISED THAT
THIS IS YOUR FAULT?

36:31.160 --> 36:33.440
[SIGHS] COME ON,
SQUIRT. WE GOTTA
TAKE YOU HOME.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.680
TIFFANY'S PROBABLY
WAITING AT THE HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

36:35.720 --> 36:37.160
YOU CALLED
A BABY-SITTER?

36:37.160 --> 36:40.000
COME ON,
YOU LIKE TIFFANY!
YOU SAID SO.

36:40.000 --> 36:42.440
YEAH, BESIDES, CHELSEA
AND I GOT PLACES TO GO.

36:42.480 --> 36:43.680
YOU'RE GONNA LET
A VAMPIRE GET MOM

36:43.680 --> 36:45.000
JUST BECAUSE
YOU WANNA GO OUT?

36:45.000 --> 36:46.160
ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

36:46.160 --> 36:47.800
I'M THE MONSTER
MASTER, RIGHT?

36:47.840 --> 36:48.800
YEAH.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.280
VAMPIRES, WEREWOLVES,

36:50.320 --> 36:51.560
EVIL ROBOTS FROM SPACE,

36:51.600 --> 36:53.240
I CAN SPOT THEM
A MILE OFF.

36:53.280 --> 36:55.520
AND DIMITRI
IS NOT A VAMPIRE.

36:57.000 --> 36:59.280
YOU GUYS SET THIS UP
SO YOU COULD GO OUT.

36:59.280 --> 37:01.080
THIS WAS<i> YOUR</i> FAULT!

37:02.520 --> 37:05.000
OK, SO WE DID!
SO WHAT, I MEAN--

37:05.000 --> 37:06.840
IT'S NOT
GONNA KILL MOM
TO GO ON A DATE.

37:06.840 --> 37:10.000
YES, IT IS BECAUSE
DIMITRI'S A VAMPIRE!

37:10.000 --> 37:11.120
ALL RIGHT, LOOK.

37:11.160 --> 37:12.480
I'M GONNA GO IN THERE

37:12.520 --> 37:14.320
AND FIND OUT
IF THIS GUY'S
REALLY A VAMPIRE.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.040
IF HE IS,
HE'S DEAD MEAT,

37:16.040 --> 37:17.960
AND IF HE'S NOT,
YOU HAVE TO GO HOME,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.200
PUT YOUR JAMMIES ON,
AND HANG OUT
WITH, UH, TIFFANY.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.160
<i>AND</i> NOT TELL MOM
THAT WE WENT OUT.

37:22.200 --> 37:25.320
DO WE HAVE A DEAL?

37:26.360 --> 37:27.840
OK, DEAL.

37:27.880 --> 37:29.320
YOU BETTER KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE
DOING.

37:29.360 --> 37:31.520
DON'T WORRY.
I GOT IT WIRED.

37:31.520 --> 37:33.680
COME ON.

37:33.720 --> 37:36.320
[DIMITRI
SPEAKING SOFTLY]

37:40.880 --> 37:44.600
HEY, MOM, DIMITRI.
HOW YOU GUYS GOING?

37:44.640 --> 37:46.400
Lynette: WHAT ARE
YOU GUYS DOING HERE?

37:46.400 --> 37:47.560
IS EVERYTHING OK?

37:47.560 --> 37:48.560
OH, EVERYTHING'S
FINE.

37:48.560 --> 37:49.600
I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

37:49.640 --> 37:52.280
FOR WATCHING
THAT MOVIE
LAST NIGHT.

37:52.320 --> 37:53.680
I THINK
IT GOT TO TAYLOR.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.320
HE'S A VAMPIRE.

37:55.360 --> 37:57.000
A VAMPIRE? WHO IS?

37:57.040 --> 37:58.080
IT'S MY FAULT

37:58.080 --> 37:59.920
FOR LETTING HIM
WATCH THE MOVIE.

37:59.920 --> 38:01.240
HE'S GOT IT IN
HIS HEAD THAT, WELL,

38:01.240 --> 38:02.600
DIMITRI HERE
IS A VAMPIRE,

38:02.640 --> 38:04.840
WHICH WE ALL
KNOW HE'S NOT,

38:04.880 --> 38:07.840
BUT INSTEAD
OF TELLING TAYLOR HERE
THAT HE-HE'S CRAZY

38:07.880 --> 38:11.040
AND GIVE HIM A LIFETIME
OF SELF-IMAGE PROBLEMS--

38:11.080 --> 38:12.760
WE HAVE TO PROVE
I'M NOT A VAMPIRE.

38:12.760 --> 38:14.680
YOU KNOW, MAYBE
I SHOULD GO HOME.

38:14.720 --> 38:16.200
NO! NO, NO, I MEAN,

38:16.240 --> 38:17.600
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU CAN'T BECAUSE--

38:17.600 --> 38:19.240
I THINK WHAT
ADAM'S TRYING TO SAY

38:19.240 --> 38:21.040
IS IF YOU GO HOME NOW

38:21.080 --> 38:23.000
THEN TAYLOR'S GONNA
SPEND THE REST OF HIS LIFE

38:23.040 --> 38:24.920
THINKING
I WAS A VAMPIRE.

38:24.920 --> 38:28.240
RIGHT, RIGHT! WE NEED
SOME SORT OF TEST.

38:30.360 --> 38:32.200
[GRAVELY]
THE SPOON TEST.

38:32.240 --> 38:34.200
THE SPOON TEST?

38:34.240 --> 38:37.320
RIGHT! THE SPOON
TEST, RIGHT!

38:37.360 --> 38:40.160
A VAMPIRE CAN'T--UH--

38:40.200 --> 38:42.680
THAT'S RIGHT.
HANG A SPOON ON HIS NOSE.

38:42.720 --> 38:45.160
RIGHT, RIGHT. THE OLD
TRANSYLVANIAN TEST.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.160
REALLY?

38:47.200 --> 38:48.400
SO YOU MEAN
YOU'RE GONNA

38:48.440 --> 38:50.960
MAKE ME TAKE
THE SPOON TEST?

38:52.080 --> 38:53.880
YOU'VE GOT NO CHOICE.

38:53.920 --> 38:56.240
BUT--BUT IF I'M
REALLY A VAMPIRE, THEN--

38:56.280 --> 38:59.160
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'LL EXPLODE
INTO A MILLION PIECES.

38:59.200 --> 39:00.520
THE ENTIRE RESTAURANT
WILL BE SPRAYED

39:00.560 --> 39:01.680
WITH YOUR
BLOODY CHUNKS

39:01.720 --> 39:06.040
OF VAMPIRE...
FESTERING...FLESH.

39:06.080 --> 39:08.960
WOW.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.680
I THINK
IT'S A CHANCE
WE'VE GOTTA TAKE.

39:10.720 --> 39:13.040
MAYBE I SHOULD GET
SOME EXTRA NAPKINS,
JUST IN CASE.

39:13.040 --> 39:15.200
HAND ME THE SPOON.

39:15.240 --> 39:19.320
SURE. RIGHT.
THIS WOULD BE IT.

39:31.000 --> 39:33.880
[ADAM SIGHS]

39:33.920 --> 39:35.520
AM I ALL RIGHT?
AM I STILL HERE?

39:35.600 --> 39:36.560
YOU'RE STILL HERE.

39:36.600 --> 39:37.840
OH, THANK GOODNESS!

39:37.840 --> 39:39.720
THERE, YOU SEE?

39:39.760 --> 39:42.680
I GUESS I'M NOT
A VAMPIRE. [CHUCKLING]

39:45.280 --> 39:47.880
OK. SORRY.

39:47.920 --> 39:49.600
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE OK,
HONEY?

39:49.640 --> 39:51.200
YEP.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

39:51.200 --> 39:54.840
FIRE'S OUT. SEE,
IF YOU'D COME HOME NOW,
HE'D FEEL TERRIBLE,

39:54.840 --> 39:56.000
WOULDN'T YOU?
OF COURSE YOU WOULD.

39:56.000 --> 39:58.160
SO, UM, YOU KNOW WHAT,
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE.

39:58.200 --> 40:00.640
SO, BYE, MOM.
BYE, DIMITRI.

40:00.680 --> 40:01.680
YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.
GOOD NIGHT

40:01.680 --> 40:04.000
AND SEE YOU LATER--

40:11.320 --> 40:14.880
[SNICKERING]
BYE-BYE!

40:22.880 --> 40:25.880
ADAM DID THE SPOON
TEST. DIMITRI'S
NOT A VAMPIRE.

40:25.880 --> 40:27.880
YEAH, WE GOTTA
GO, TAYLOR.

40:27.880 --> 40:30.680
YOU WERE REALLY GOOD
WITH THE KIDS.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.720
WELL,
I LOVE CHILDREN.

40:32.720 --> 40:33.960
I THINK
THEY'RE SWEET.

40:34.000 --> 40:36.000
WELL, I WOULDN'T
CALL MY KIDS SWEET,

40:36.080 --> 40:38.360
BUT THEY ARE
GOOD KIDS.

40:38.400 --> 40:39.520
WELL, YOU'VE
OBVIOUSLY DONE

40:39.560 --> 40:41.240
A VERY GOOD JOB
WITH THEM.

40:41.240 --> 40:44.040
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETIMES
I'M NOT SO SURE.

40:44.080 --> 40:47.120
WELL, I AM, LYNETTE.

40:47.160 --> 40:50.120
YOU KNOW, I SEE
A POWER IN YOU,
LYNETTE.

40:50.160 --> 40:52.200
NO, NO,
MAYBE NOT A POWER.

40:52.240 --> 40:55.840
MORE LIKE A--A FIRE.

40:55.880 --> 40:59.080
JUST SMOLDERING
JUST BENEATH
THE SURFACE.

41:02.040 --> 41:05.840
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE TIME TO LET
THAT FIRE BURN.

41:23.680 --> 41:24.800
HI, TIFFANY.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.640
HEY, TAYLOR-MADE.
HOW'S IT GOING, KIDDO?

41:26.680 --> 41:27.920
GREAT.

41:27.960 --> 41:31.400
WAIT JUST A SECOND.
BYE, TAYLOR, SEE YOU!

41:33.960 --> 41:35.440
CAN I PUT MY BIKE
AWAY, PLEASE?

41:35.440 --> 41:36.720
NO.

41:36.760 --> 41:37.960
WHAT IS
WITH YOU ANYWAY?

41:37.960 --> 41:39.640
WE HAVE TO GET BACK
TO THE RESTAURANT.

41:39.640 --> 41:41.400
PETER WILL BE HERE
IN, LIKE,
10 MINUTES!

41:41.440 --> 41:44.000
FORGET ABOUT PETER!
DIMITRI'S A VAMPIRE.
I SAW HIM.

41:44.040 --> 41:45.520
I MEAN,
I DIDN'T SEE HIM.

41:45.560 --> 41:46.520
IN THE MIRROR
AT THE RESTAURANT.

41:46.560 --> 41:48.040
YEAH, RIGHT.

41:48.080 --> 41:50.240
NO, I'M SERIOUS!
THE GUY DIDN'T REFLECT
IN THE MIRROR.

41:50.320 --> 41:52.160
JUST MOM AND NOTHING.

41:52.240 --> 41:54.280
COME ON. WE GOTTA
GET HER OUT OF THERE.

41:54.320 --> 41:55.880
IF HE WAS A VAMPIRE,

41:55.920 --> 41:58.880
WOULDN'T HE
BE A LITTLE BIT
MORE...EVIL?

41:58.920 --> 42:00.920
HE'S TRYING TO MAKE HER
FALL IN LOVE WITH HIM.

42:00.960 --> 42:02.520
IF SHE GOES TO HIM
WILLINGLY,

42:02.560 --> 42:04.360
THEN SHE'S,
WELL, HIS FOREVER.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.720
YOU'RE GOING
TO MISS YOUR CONCERT

42:05.760 --> 42:06.880
AND SCREW UP
MY DATE.

42:06.960 --> 42:09.760
IF WE DON'T DO SOMETHING,
MOM'S HAD IT!

42:09.840 --> 42:11.760
PLEASE, YOU'VE
GOTTA BELIEVE ME.

42:11.760 --> 42:12.840
WELL, I DON'T!

42:12.840 --> 42:14.080
BUT WHAT IF I'M RIGHT?

42:14.120 --> 42:15.800
COME ON, CHELS.

DON'T YOU?

42:21.840 --> 42:24.160
I'M OK WITH THAT.

42:24.160 --> 42:26.160
[WOLF HOWLING]

42:29.360 --> 42:31.120

THANK YOU.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.040
THERE'S MORE?

42:35.080 --> 42:37.600
WELL, OF COURSE.
IT JUST GETS BETTER.

42:37.640 --> 42:39.800
OK. WHERE TO?

42:39.840 --> 42:41.200

MAYBE WE'D FIND

JUST WALK A LITTLE?

NO, I'M NOT
MAKING THIS UP!

YES, I KNOW
IT'S CRAZY.

REALLY HAVE TO GO TO BED.

PROBABLY JUST
STAY OUT HERE.

44:21.760 --> 44:23.920
IT'S OK. I ASKED HIM
TO COME OVER.

GOTTA GO TO BED NOW.

44:35.480 --> 44:37.680
I'M GONNA
SAVE IT FOR LATER,

NOW, THIS GUY

YOUR MOTHER
LAST NIGHT

IN A SUPERMARKET?

YEAH, BUT DIMITRI'S
NOT A VAMPIRE.

THE SPOON TEST.

THEY WENT
AFTER THE VAMPIRE.

WHY WOULD
THEY WANNA DO
A THING LIKE THAT?

45:02.000 --> 45:03.960
