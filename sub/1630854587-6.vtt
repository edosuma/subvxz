00:14.000 --> 00:16.541
Hello, everyone.
I've got an announcement to make.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.000
Finally.

00:22.958 --> 00:25.041
What? I'm not gay.

00:25.125 --> 00:26.125
That's a relief.

00:26.208 --> 00:31.250
As a family-valued Republican,
I don't condone that lifestyle.

00:32.208 --> 00:35.625
What I was trying to announce
is that I am boycotting Lovely Corp.

00:35.708 --> 00:37.833
I am done using their products!

00:41.041 --> 00:41.875
Damn it!

00:41.958 --> 00:45.166
Ah, you're just jealous
'cause Charles Lovely stole Gina,

00:45.250 --> 00:48.166
your quote-unquote girlfriend, AFKAK.

00:48.250 --> 00:50.250
I love Lovely Corp products.

00:50.333 --> 00:53.541
I just bought a pair
of Lovely Corp horse detector glasses.

00:53.625 --> 00:55.583
Why would you need horse detector glasses?

00:55.666 --> 00:59.666
Because 98% of Americans
suffer from horse blindness.

01:00.791 --> 01:03.083
Holy shit.

01:03.166 --> 01:06.083
And look at my cool Lovely Corp product.

01:06.166 --> 01:08.000
The Snuggle Me Lovely Doll.

01:08.083 --> 01:09.500
It even talks to me.

01:10.083 --> 01:14.125
<i>You are</i>
<i>a collection of cells. Nothing more.</i>

01:14.208 --> 01:17.208
I got me a new Lovely Corp insulin pump

01:17.291 --> 01:19.750
slash soft-serve machine.

01:22.375 --> 01:23.666
Can I have a cone?

01:23.750 --> 01:25.666
Get your own damn diabetes!

01:27.500 --> 01:31.541
Oh yeah, I'd love to buy useless crap too,
but I can't, on account that I'm a dog.

01:31.625 --> 01:32.708
Also, I'm broke,

01:32.791 --> 01:35.500
because the only job for dogs
in this town is being an art model.

01:36.583 --> 01:38.625
Hey! Think you can hurry up?

01:40.375 --> 01:41.541
Almost done.

01:43.291 --> 01:47.083
What? You all thought
it was funny when Dusty did it!

01:47.166 --> 01:48.750
Man, being a dog sucks.

01:48.833 --> 01:51.000
I can't even buy booze
because I'm only seven,

01:51.083 --> 01:53.250
and by the time I turn 21, I'll be dead.

01:53.333 --> 01:56.208
And really, there's not even,
like, a single difference between me

01:56.291 --> 01:57.625
and anyone else in this…

01:57.708 --> 02:00.958
Fuck you! Fuck you, vacuum cleaner!
Suck my dick! I fucking hate you!

02:01.041 --> 02:03.583
…room. Not a single thing different.

02:04.250 --> 02:06.250
Hey, check this out, AFKAK.

02:06.333 --> 02:09.541
It's the Lovely Corp Glory Wormhole.

02:09.625 --> 02:10.958
For when you hate to travel,

02:11.041 --> 02:15.041
but still got a hankering
for some good ol' alien cock.

02:15.125 --> 02:17.250
Step one, find a wall.

02:17.958 --> 02:20.083
Step two, remove your teeth.

02:21.458 --> 02:22.333
-Step--

02:22.416 --> 02:25.500
And I got the Lovely Corp
Old People Mute Button.

02:25.583 --> 02:26.708
It also works on grandmas

02:26.791 --> 02:29.125
who won't shut the fuck up
about me finding a church.

02:29.208 --> 02:31.916
One minute, I'm threatening
to smother Hopson in his sleep,

02:32.000 --> 02:36.583
and like magic, an ad for the Old People
Mute Button popped up on my phone.

02:36.666 --> 02:39.250
That's because the Lovely Phones
are listening to everything you say

02:39.333 --> 02:41.416
and serving you targeted ads.

02:41.500 --> 02:44.750
You sound like one of those
conspiracy wackjobs. Phones don't do that.

02:48.416 --> 02:53.250
<i>Are you a dog who needs a job</i>
<i>where you get paid to take drugs?</i>

02:53.333 --> 02:55.208
Hello, C story.

02:56.083 --> 02:58.041
Hey, you diaper dickhead.

02:58.125 --> 03:00.416
Where the hell do you think
you're taking that mattress?

03:00.500 --> 03:04.583
Oh, I'm just moving into your office.
You know, 'cause you'll be dead tomorrow.

03:04.666 --> 03:07.541
Oh, what do you mean
I'll be dead tomorrow?

03:07.625 --> 03:11.125
You don't know about the Crawford curse?

03:12.083 --> 03:15.750
Two hundred years ago, on this very day,

03:15.833 --> 03:20.958
your ancestor Claudius Crawford
burned 100 witches at the stake.

03:21.041 --> 03:24.750
But not before they cast
the Crawford curse.

03:24.833 --> 03:29.291
At the age of 50,
every Crawford drops dead.

03:29.375 --> 03:31.333
Hey, we do all die at 50.

03:31.416 --> 03:34.583
I thought it was because
we push down the feels and we're all fat.

03:34.666 --> 03:38.500
No. It's the Crawford curse.

03:38.583 --> 03:39.416
Look.

03:41.750 --> 03:45.666
Whoa! They all died
on the same date, and it's tomorrow!

03:45.750 --> 03:48.333
Oh shit. I gotta reverse that curse!

03:48.416 --> 03:51.833
Well, you could try talking
to the last living witch in town.

03:51.916 --> 03:56.583
She can be found at the edge
of Paradise, in the Bewitched Caves.

03:56.666 --> 03:58.958
I better get there quick. Thanks, Hopson.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.125
-Hyah!

04:15.750 --> 04:16.583
Oh yeah.

04:17.083 --> 04:19.833
The Macho Man took a look at the books,

04:19.916 --> 04:23.833
and he is concerned
about the amount of money, yeah,

04:23.916 --> 04:26.083
Lovely Corp has wasted.

04:26.166 --> 04:30.750
I for one only spend money
on bare necessities.

04:30.833 --> 04:34.125
Like this $300,000 levitating levi-table.

04:34.208 --> 04:36.083
It's just a regular table.

04:36.166 --> 04:39.208
Ah. It <i>looks</i> like a regular table.

04:39.291 --> 04:42.958
I had them add legs!
It looked weird without the legs.

04:43.041 --> 04:47.458
Yeah. Macho Man was up
all night making slides,

04:47.541 --> 04:50.708
and Mr. Lovely
isn't even paying attention.

04:51.833 --> 04:53.750
He's got no pulse!

04:53.833 --> 04:55.208
So at least that's normal.

05:01.375 --> 05:06.375
Pardon me. I was on a conference call
in the ethereal plane.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.791
I have learned
that before this day is done,

05:09.875 --> 05:13.666
someone in my company will betray me.

05:14.208 --> 05:15.916
I'll bet it's Gary!

05:16.000 --> 05:17.833
What? What are you basing that on?

05:17.916 --> 05:20.541
Yesterday, when we were pissing
next to each other,

05:20.625 --> 05:24.250
you got all "nervous"
'cause I kept looking at your tallywacker.

05:24.833 --> 05:27.083
What are you hiding, Gary?
Let's see that dick!

05:27.166 --> 05:29.875
Let's not jump to conclusions.

05:29.958 --> 05:32.166
Thester, Gina.

05:32.250 --> 05:37.291
I want you to root out this mole
and bring him before me.

05:37.375 --> 05:40.458
Mind if we get back to business?

05:40.541 --> 05:42.833
Starting over. Oh yeah.

05:42.916 --> 05:46.958
They say wrestling is fake,
but this guy is real

05:47.041 --> 05:47.875
boring!

05:47.958 --> 05:49.625
Ah!

05:49.708 --> 05:53.791
I've been given a seat
at the table, and I plan to use it.

05:57.708 --> 05:59.333
Good thing wrestling is fake,

05:59.416 --> 06:01.541
or that could have caused
a lot of brain dar--

06:01.625 --> 06:04.041
Dar, dar, dar…

06:08.833 --> 06:10.083
Is your name The Witch?

06:10.166 --> 06:11.208
Yes.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.958
Ha ha! Melt, cunt!

06:15.500 --> 06:18.958
Okay. I-I feel like we got off
on the wrong foot.

06:19.041 --> 06:20.416
Anyway, I need a favor.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.958
I need you to lift that Crawford curse.

06:23.041 --> 06:25.875
-No.
-Please! I don't wanna die!

06:25.958 --> 06:28.875
Just lift the curse! I'll do anything!

06:28.958 --> 06:30.583
I will lift the curse

06:30.666 --> 06:36.083
if you bring me
the single thing that I desire.

06:36.166 --> 06:40.500
But it is the rarest of the rare.

06:41.083 --> 06:45.166
Are you familiar with the movie…

06:45.250 --> 06:46.208
<i>Cats</i>?

06:46.291 --> 06:47.916
Uh, yeah.

06:48.000 --> 06:53.208
Well, legend has it
that a version of the movie exists

06:53.291 --> 06:57.708
where all the cats have exposed buttholes!

06:59.041 --> 07:01.583
It must be mine.

07:01.666 --> 07:04.458
You want the Butt Cut of <i>Cats</i>. All right.

07:04.541 --> 07:06.916
I thought it was gonna be
something weird and random.

07:07.000 --> 07:09.791
Don't worry, lady. I won't let you down.

07:11.666 --> 07:13.125
Ha ha! Melt, cunt!

07:15.875 --> 07:17.166
Well, nice meetin' ya.

07:20.375 --> 07:23.291
Bullet, welcome to your new job.

07:23.375 --> 07:26.083
Animal testing experimental drugs.

07:26.166 --> 07:29.000
You'll take a series of different drugs
over the next two weeks

07:29.083 --> 07:30.791
to check for side effects.

07:30.875 --> 07:33.583
Two weeks? Pfft. Just do them all today.

07:33.666 --> 07:36.708
You can handle 14 drugs in one day?

07:36.791 --> 07:39.083
I got 14 drugs up my ass right now, buddy.

07:39.166 --> 07:42.250
You know,
that's my favorite Miley Cyrus song.

07:42.333 --> 07:43.541
Let's get started.

07:43.625 --> 07:45.666
This pill clears up dandruff.

07:45.750 --> 07:49.208
Rate the side effect severity
on a scale of one to ten.

07:53.083 --> 07:53.916
I'ma say two.

07:59.541 --> 08:02.125
Wow! My restless legs have cleared up.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.458
I'll give that a check mark.

08:08.666 --> 08:10.625
This one? This one didn't do anything.

08:10.708 --> 08:12.791
I've got a bit of dry mouth.

08:21.958 --> 08:24.500
All right, enough dicking around.
Where's the good shit?

08:24.583 --> 08:27.625
We do have one more drug,
but it's never been tested before, and--

08:27.708 --> 08:29.916
Yeah, whatever.
I'll call you if anything happens.

08:30.416 --> 08:31.750
I gotta go score some drugs.

08:31.833 --> 08:34.791
Hey! Can we stop for boba?

08:50.375 --> 08:54.750
Time to get some dirt on Charles Lovely.

08:54.833 --> 08:55.875
No results?

08:55.958 --> 08:59.250
All right. Let's try Chuck Lovely.

08:59.333 --> 09:01.833
Oh my God. This guy's a monster!

09:01.916 --> 09:03.833
Hey, Kevin. You typed "Chuck Lorre."

09:05.375 --> 09:07.291
It's a text from a blocked number.

09:07.375 --> 09:11.500
"I just heard through your phone
that you want dirt on Charles Lovely."

09:11.583 --> 09:14.916
"Meet me on the roof
of Lovely Corp at midnight."

09:15.000 --> 09:15.833
Yes!

09:15.916 --> 09:17.958
I guess privacy is overrated.

09:18.041 --> 09:21.125
Maybe they were too hard on Zuckerberg
at the congressional hearings.

09:21.208 --> 09:22.583
Mr. Zuckerberg,

09:22.666 --> 09:27.083
how do you respond to the accusations
that your website spreads disinformation

09:27.166 --> 09:29.500
and is actively destroying our democracy?

09:35.500 --> 09:36.750
Higher hair, please.

09:37.375 --> 09:38.458
I see.

09:38.541 --> 09:40.208
Well, I for one

09:40.291 --> 09:42.125
am satisfied with that answer.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.833
Good morning, <i>mi broz-a-mundos</i>.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.750
These are getting hard to come up with.

09:47.833 --> 09:48.666
Where's Bullet?

09:48.750 --> 09:50.291
I think he's still sleeping.

09:50.375 --> 09:52.791
Bullet! Get your drug-filled ass out here.

09:54.208 --> 09:55.625
Cold in here.

09:57.250 --> 09:59.750
It's a leprechaun! Kill that motherfucker!

10:00.333 --> 10:01.750
Ha ha! Melt, cunt!

10:02.750 --> 10:04.333
Hey, man! What's your problem?

10:04.416 --> 10:06.166
Bullet? Is that you?

10:07.791 --> 10:11.666
Holy shit! That pill turned me human!
This is awesome!

10:11.750 --> 10:14.791
What's awesome about it?
You're a creepy little man.

10:14.875 --> 10:17.583
You look like the voice
of Comedy Central or some shit.

10:17.666 --> 10:19.375
Hey. Cut it out with that shit.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.833
At least I'll finally get some respect
around here now.

10:21.916 --> 10:23.666
Nope. You're out of the Brozone.

10:23.750 --> 10:27.458
We need a party dog, not a guy
that looks like he believes in ghosts.

10:27.541 --> 10:30.208
Fine. I'll leave right after breakfast.

10:30.291 --> 10:31.708
You can't do that!

10:31.791 --> 10:33.958
Why not? I can finally see my veins.

10:34.041 --> 10:37.208
Nobody wants to see
a scumbag munchkin do heroin.

10:37.291 --> 10:40.250
Yeah, we like to see a cute dog do heroin.

10:40.333 --> 10:43.208
Sometimes you'd have
a adorable little seizure

10:43.291 --> 10:45.583
with little puppy foam
coming out of your mouth.

10:45.666 --> 10:49.750
Get outta here! Go bake cookies
in a tree or something, you fucking elf.

10:49.833 --> 10:51.958
Yeah! And you better not come back.

10:52.041 --> 10:53.625
Without them fucking cookies.

10:53.708 --> 10:57.750
Huh. I feel like there was something
I was supposed to do today.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.875
Remember? You're supposed
to get the Butt Cut of <i>Cats</i>,

11:00.958 --> 11:02.708
or you gonna die in seven hours!

11:02.791 --> 11:05.750
Oh! Shit, right!
H-How do I keep getting distracted?

11:07.375 --> 11:08.958
There's gotta be answers online.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.166
Google! Uh, what was I looking up again?

11:11.250 --> 11:14.541
Oh yeah. "How much does Joe Pesci weigh?"

11:14.625 --> 11:15.833
Randall, focus.

11:15.916 --> 11:17.750
I can help you find that Butt Cut.

11:17.833 --> 11:21.000
I happen to have Hollywood connections.

11:21.083 --> 11:23.416
Shut up, Dusty.
I'm looking up something important.

11:23.500 --> 11:27.000
"Do ladybugs have clits?"

11:27.083 --> 11:29.041
Nope. They do not. Okay.

11:29.125 --> 11:31.916
"Do tarantulas have clits?"

11:32.000 --> 11:33.958
Chief, come on! You're gonna die!

11:34.041 --> 11:38.833
I need to know!
I need to know if tarantulas have clits!

11:43.416 --> 11:44.916
-Are you the mole?

11:45.000 --> 11:46.708
No.

11:46.791 --> 11:48.083
Are you the mole?

11:48.166 --> 11:50.083
Okay, okay. I'll admit it.

11:50.166 --> 11:52.208
I'm a small subterranean mammal.

11:52.291 --> 11:55.541
I dug up your garden,
and I'll do it again!

11:57.541 --> 11:59.541
Shit. I think I hit him too hard.

11:59.625 --> 12:01.166
Ugh. This is going nowhere.

12:01.250 --> 12:04.625
Tell me about it.
I didn't find a thing in the men's room.

12:05.333 --> 12:06.291
But don't worry.

12:06.375 --> 12:11.250
I'll have the low-level employees
spilling their guts in no time.

12:11.333 --> 12:15.708
I'm gonna go undercover
as one of them and earn their trust.

12:15.791 --> 12:20.375
I just need to look the part
of the modern working man.

12:21.375 --> 12:24.583
'Ello, guvnahs. I'm Nigel Steamwhistle.

12:24.666 --> 12:29.583
I work here at Lovely Corp,
and I'm a poor, just like you.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.250
I make 100 grand a year.

13:03.375 --> 13:05.708
Wait.
Do you think we're chimney sweeps?

13:05.791 --> 13:09.166
Uh…

13:09.250 --> 13:10.083
Yes?

13:10.166 --> 13:12.041
Where do you think
you are, buddy?

13:12.125 --> 13:13.625
Chimney sweeps are on the third floor.

13:24.333 --> 13:27.375
Dusty! Good to see you,
you old fat person, you.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.958
Did you know
this guy lost Disney $14 million

13:30.041 --> 13:31.666
on a mindless, idiotic reboot?

13:31.750 --> 13:32.750
Wow.

13:32.833 --> 13:33.791
I know, right?

13:33.875 --> 13:36.208
Best damn TV exec Disney ever had.

13:36.291 --> 13:38.750
Lucky for me,
I just landed this job at NBC Streaming

13:38.833 --> 13:40.458
after I got fired from the Mouse

13:40.541 --> 13:44.000
for accidentally saying the word "gay"
in Florida. Whoops.

13:44.083 --> 13:46.541
Listen, we gotta tell you
about a witch's curse

13:46.625 --> 13:50.833
that can only be broken
by <i>Cats</i> with exposed buttholes.

13:50.916 --> 13:54.208
I'll buy it. Can Zendaya play the witch?

13:54.291 --> 13:56.375
We're not pitching a show, asshole!

13:56.458 --> 13:59.541
This is life or death!
We need the Butt Cut of <i>Cats</i>!

13:59.625 --> 14:01.166
The Butt Cut of <i>Cats</i>?

14:01.250 --> 14:04.458
That's an urban legend.
It doesn't exist.

14:04.541 --> 14:08.666
Now excuse me. We're relaunching Peacock
because nobody noticed the first time.

14:08.750 --> 14:10.958
Three, two, one…

14:11.041 --> 14:12.291
We're live!

14:12.375 --> 14:13.250
And we folded.

14:16.625 --> 14:19.583
Why, yes. I am available to fail upwards.

14:19.666 --> 14:21.750
Head of Warner Brothers? Sounds great.

14:21.833 --> 14:23.833
Since I no longer work here,
I'll shoot you straight.

14:23.916 --> 14:27.708
The Butt Cut <i>does</i> exist,
but to find it, you'll have to see--

14:33.333 --> 14:35.583
Find the fat, annoying one.

14:37.125 --> 14:38.791
James Corden?!

14:38.875 --> 14:41.916
Well, I'm off to my job
as head of Warner Brothers.

14:42.000 --> 14:43.541
Hey, you forgot your brain.

14:43.625 --> 14:46.375
I won't be needing that.

14:52.375 --> 14:54.541
Hey! What the hell are you doing?

14:54.625 --> 14:57.666
I do this every day.
Don't worry. Calm down.

14:57.750 --> 14:58.625
I'm gonna eat it.

14:58.708 --> 15:00.041
Get him, boy. Sic him.

15:02.083 --> 15:05.458
Phil! No, no! It's me! It's Bullet!
I sniffed your ass yesterday!

15:07.208 --> 15:08.375
That'll be ten bucks.

15:08.458 --> 15:10.208
Well, I don't have ten bucks.

15:10.291 --> 15:12.083
But I do have these.

15:14.083 --> 15:17.416
This leprechaun refused to pay,
and he tried to give me a blow job.

15:17.500 --> 15:19.625
What? I didn't try to give you a blow job!

15:19.708 --> 15:21.000
Yes, you did.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.958
You gave me those blow-job eyes.
I've seen them before.

15:24.041 --> 15:25.958
Hey, Hopson. Meet me in the alley in five.

15:28.458 --> 15:32.541
Yeah! They never let me
in this porno theater when I was a dog.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.166
Ooh, this is getting hot.

15:36.208 --> 15:38.666
Aw, what the hell?
I can't even lick my own crank!

15:40.500 --> 15:41.916
No, Hopson. No!

15:43.916 --> 15:46.541
Hello! I'm James Corden!

15:46.625 --> 15:47.750
Please love me.

15:47.833 --> 15:49.333
I'll sing! I'll dance!

15:49.416 --> 15:53.125
You can even put cigarettes out on me,
as long as you love me!

15:53.208 --> 15:56.083
Anyway, tonight's guests
are Chris Hemsworth

15:56.166 --> 15:58.208
and Liam Hemsworth.

16:01.750 --> 16:03.916
How are you guys doing?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.833
I'm just over here being the hot one.

16:06.916 --> 16:09.125
No, the hot one is me!

16:09.208 --> 16:10.375
Bro fight!

16:10.458 --> 16:12.416
Who wants to see us make out?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.166
No! No!

16:14.250 --> 16:18.000
So, what are you two here promoting?

16:18.083 --> 16:20.833
I got a new, uh… <i>Thor</i> movie.

16:20.916 --> 16:23.500
And I've got herpes from Hannah Montana.

16:43.375 --> 16:44.375
Enough of this shit!

16:44.458 --> 16:47.458
Corden, tell me
where the Butt Cut is, or I'll kill ya!

16:47.541 --> 16:49.125
You think I fear death?

16:49.208 --> 16:52.666
If I die, I won't have
to be James Corden anymore.

16:52.750 --> 16:56.791
Maybe I'll come back as a tampon.
Something someone needs!

16:56.875 --> 16:58.166
Fine. How's about this?

16:58.250 --> 16:59.583
You tell me where it is,

16:59.666 --> 17:02.791
and I'll give you a hug
and tell you you're a good singer.

17:02.875 --> 17:06.500
D-Daddy needs it! Daddy must have it!
Piggie wanna suckle!

17:06.583 --> 17:08.875
Okay, the Butt Cut is hidden.
It's in Peru.

17:08.958 --> 17:11.458
Where in Peru? Is there a map?

17:11.541 --> 17:15.333
Yes. But they hid it in the one place
no one would dare to look.

17:16.625 --> 17:17.791
It's there.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.291
Put it away! Put it away!

17:19.375 --> 17:23.083
Well, if you wanna find the Butt Cut,
you'll have to take me with you.

17:39.541 --> 17:42.208
Even this map
feels like it's trying too hard.

17:45.041 --> 17:48.083
I can't believe that being a human
is even worse than being a dog.

17:48.166 --> 17:49.500
Being a human is great.

17:49.583 --> 17:52.291
I'll teach you all the cool stuff
about being a human.

17:52.375 --> 17:55.208
Humans get to spend
a lot of time here at the gym.

17:55.291 --> 17:56.625
Because when a human gets fat,

17:56.708 --> 17:59.208
people hate you
and think you're disgusting.

17:59.291 --> 18:02.541
Humans get to do this thing called taxes.

18:02.625 --> 18:04.916
It's a fun game
we play with the government.

18:05.000 --> 18:08.375
They know how much you owe them,
but they want you to guess.

18:08.458 --> 18:09.833
What do you get if you guess right?

18:09.916 --> 18:12.541
You get to give them
a third of your salary.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.000
And if you guess wrong?

18:14.083 --> 18:16.708
They put your human ass in prison.

18:16.791 --> 18:21.083
All humans have a little friend
inside of them. It's called guilt.

18:21.166 --> 18:24.458
That little friend will have you attending
a lot of shitty one-act plays,

18:24.541 --> 18:25.541
escape rooms,

18:25.625 --> 18:28.083
and weddings for people you can't stand.

18:28.166 --> 18:29.958
And after spending half your paycheck

18:30.041 --> 18:32.666
flying to Des Moines
and buying an expensive gift,

18:32.750 --> 18:34.125
you still get asked…

18:34.208 --> 18:35.958
Why aren't you dancing?

18:36.041 --> 18:40.666
Humans get to spend a lot of time
acting like they're reading a cereal box,

18:40.750 --> 18:44.708
but they're really thinking
about the sweet release of death.

18:44.791 --> 18:46.250
Fitz, you-- you feeling okay?

18:46.333 --> 18:48.166
Oh, that's right.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.083
Humans are supposed to feel!

18:50.166 --> 18:54.250
But be careful. If you don't feel enough,
they'll send you to a special school.

18:54.333 --> 18:56.916
If you feel too much,
they'll lock you up forever…

18:57.000 --> 19:00.291
…in a padded room.

19:00.375 --> 19:02.375
And with that,
I think I'm gonna go to the lab

19:02.458 --> 19:05.208
and try to get an antidote
to turn me back into a dog.

19:06.083 --> 19:10.000
You sure? I was about to show you
how humans get to watch James Corden.

19:10.083 --> 19:12.208
Look. Somebody cut his tits off.

19:12.291 --> 19:16.291
That's a fun new bit.

19:18.958 --> 19:22.708
We went up the treasure trail,
took a left at the hairy cancer mole,

19:22.791 --> 19:27.125
crossed the hive-covered bitch tit,
across the river of dried gravy.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.250
We almost up to the nipple temple.

19:35.333 --> 19:36.708
We need to be careful.

19:36.791 --> 19:41.208
These places are usually rigged
with booby traps. So don't touch anything!

19:41.291 --> 19:42.458
Wonder what this does.

19:42.541 --> 19:43.708
No! Dusty, don't!

19:45.583 --> 19:47.375
Maybe it goes this way.

19:48.250 --> 19:49.083
Ow!

19:50.833 --> 19:54.500
I'ma pull it again. 'Cause I'm bad.

19:58.500 --> 20:01.583
Quit messing around!
I'm trying to save your damn life!

20:04.250 --> 20:05.333
Leave this to me.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.208
Huh? Since when do you carry a whip?

20:11.291 --> 20:13.375
Whip? That's Fruit by the Foot.

20:17.041 --> 20:17.875
Tarantulas.

20:17.958 --> 20:21.333
Why'd you pull me off Google before
I could find out if they have clits?

20:21.416 --> 20:23.166
What the hell good would that do?

20:23.250 --> 20:26.583
I could pleasure them all orally,
and they'd be so relaxed

20:26.666 --> 20:28.625
that we could crawl outta here.

20:28.708 --> 20:30.541
Screw it. I'm just gonna do it anyway.

20:37.250 --> 20:38.666
I think one of them liked it.

20:38.750 --> 20:41.166
You're not getting that movie!

20:42.416 --> 20:45.875
It's Rebel Wilson! Run for your life!

20:49.041 --> 20:51.250
We ain't gonna make it!

20:51.333 --> 20:52.750
Oh, the hell we're not.

21:05.625 --> 21:08.458
No! Oh, my poor horse is getting crushed!

21:08.541 --> 21:13.125
Oh God, it's terrible!
There's horse guts everywhere!

21:15.375 --> 21:16.750
Oh. That's better.

21:18.958 --> 21:20.541
What the hell?

21:26.208 --> 21:27.166
Hey, Doc.

21:27.250 --> 21:28.916
Leprechaun!

21:29.000 --> 21:30.000
Melt, cunt!

21:30.500 --> 21:32.291
It's me, Bullet!

21:32.375 --> 21:34.916
Listen, that pill you gave me
had a pretty big side effect.

21:35.000 --> 21:37.875
It turned me human!
I need an antidote to switch back.

21:37.958 --> 21:41.041
Oh, Bullet. That's no side effect.

21:41.125 --> 21:44.458
The drug did exactly
what it was supposed to do.

21:44.541 --> 21:49.291
Rid the world of dogs
by turning them all human!

21:49.375 --> 21:52.166
That sounds like a plan
that a cat would come up with.

21:52.250 --> 21:53.458
Wait a second.

21:53.541 --> 21:55.166
Is that your saucer of milk?

21:56.708 --> 21:58.333
You got me.

21:58.416 --> 22:01.583
I tested that drug on myself first.

22:01.666 --> 22:05.833
When all you dogs are living out
your miserable human lives,

22:05.916 --> 22:09.791
I'll safely turn myself
back into a cat with this!

22:09.875 --> 22:13.791
Once there are no more barking assholes
to chase me into the street.

22:13.875 --> 22:16.666
Well, this is dumb.
But I'll bet it's about to get dumber.

22:16.750 --> 22:23.000
The war between cats and dogs
has been going on since the dawn of time.

22:23.083 --> 22:24.208
Uh-huh.

22:24.291 --> 22:28.041
But it was a clean fight
until the dogs did the unthinkable!

22:28.125 --> 22:29.208
Oh, did they now?

22:29.291 --> 22:34.875
Something that would turn
every creature on earth against our kind.

22:34.958 --> 22:39.000
They made the movie <i>Cats</i>!

22:44.500 --> 22:46.291
Looking for this?

22:47.666 --> 22:51.125
Yeah, but it's been a long day.
So please don't bother explaining--

22:51.208 --> 22:52.833
When we produced this film…

22:52.916 --> 22:53.875
Fuck me.

22:53.958 --> 22:56.958
…we thought the buttholes
would be more embarrassing for the cats.

22:57.041 --> 22:58.958
But it actually made the movie better!

22:59.041 --> 23:01.750
So we hid it away. Here.

23:01.833 --> 23:03.791
Ha! I'll be taking that.

23:04.875 --> 23:06.625
Not so fast, Randall.

23:06.708 --> 23:08.416
I'll be taking that.

23:08.500 --> 23:10.083
I'm working for the cats.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.333
What cats?

23:12.500 --> 23:13.875
Not so fast.

23:13.958 --> 23:16.541
I'll be taking that.

23:16.625 --> 23:18.416
What the hell are you doing here?

23:18.500 --> 23:20.291
And why does a witch need a gun?

23:20.375 --> 23:23.083
Looks like we all gonna die today.

23:23.166 --> 23:27.666
Or we could just release the movie
so everyone gets to enjoy it.

23:28.750 --> 23:30.208
Well, that works for me.

23:30.291 --> 23:35.500
I made up the curse 'cause I wanted
to see Ian McKellen's asshole. Again.

23:35.583 --> 23:38.208
Hopson! I'm gonna kill you!

23:40.041 --> 23:41.250
-What the--

23:42.875 --> 23:45.458
Fuck! I killed another horse!

23:48.125 --> 23:51.375
Excellent, Dusty.
You retrieved the Butt Cut.

23:51.458 --> 23:54.833
Now people finally
will be able to enjoy that movie!

23:54.916 --> 23:57.625
What a great victory for cats everywhere!

24:20.250 --> 24:21.125
Who are you?

24:21.208 --> 24:24.083
Let's just say
I'm definitely not the skeleton

24:24.166 --> 24:27.291
of the "Macho Man" Randy Savage. Oh yeah.

24:27.375 --> 24:30.458
I've been looking
into Lovely Corp's finances

24:30.541 --> 24:33.166
and discovered something very disturbing.

24:33.250 --> 24:34.125
It's all here.

24:34.750 --> 24:40.750
Charles Lovely is planning something
called "The Eternal Reckoning." Oh yeah.

24:40.833 --> 24:43.000
What's "The Eternal Reckoning Oh Yeah"?

24:43.083 --> 24:46.791
No. It's not "The Eternal Reckoning
Oh Yeah." Oh yeah.

24:46.875 --> 24:49.500
It's just "The Eternal Reckoning."
Oh yeah!

24:49.583 --> 24:50.833
That's what I said.

24:50.916 --> 24:53.208
It's a verbal tic. Oh yeah.

24:53.291 --> 24:54.958
Moving on. Oh yeah.

24:55.041 --> 24:59.208
Not sure what it is, but I know
it has something to do with this.

25:11.875 --> 25:17.208
Kevin AFKAK knows too much.
He must be dealt with.

25:17.291 --> 25:19.500
And who is our mole?

25:19.583 --> 25:22.583
I could recognize that voice anywhere.

25:22.666 --> 25:24.458
It's definitely…

25:24.541 --> 25:26.083
Gary! Get him!

25:26.166 --> 25:27.916
It wasn't me! I swear!

25:33.833 --> 25:35.666
I know what Charles Lovely is planning.

25:35.750 --> 25:38.791
We do too.
He's planning to buy the whole town!

25:38.875 --> 25:41.208
Actually, I just did,

25:41.291 --> 25:45.583
and you will want to hear
my first act as new owner.

25:45.666 --> 25:50.333
Kevin AFKAK,
you are banished from Paradise

25:50.416 --> 25:53.083
and may never return.

25:53.166 --> 25:55.041
What?! You can't do that!

25:55.125 --> 25:56.875
Uh, this sounds like a whole thing,

25:56.958 --> 25:59.583
so, if you'll excuse me,
I got a premiere to go to.

26:03.291 --> 26:06.208
I don't know what it is
about those exposed buttholes,

26:06.291 --> 26:12.333
but they turn this stupid, dog-shit film
into a goddamn masterpiece!
