[ LAUGHTER ]

18:02.900 --> 18:04.600
INSIDE ALL OF US IS A BURNING

18:04.600 --> 18:05.133
FLAME.

18:05.133 --> 18:06.800
SO, THAT'S WHAT IT COMES DOWN

MOMENT.

18:19.433 --> 18:20.867
>> I THINK SINCE I WAS BORN.

18:20.867 --> 18:21.900
>> DO YOU REALIZE WHAT'S GONNA

18:21.900 --> 18:22.900
HAPPEN WHEN THIS CURTAIN GETS

18:22.900 --> 18:23.633

18:51.633 --> 18:53.333
ON THE BACK OVER HERE --

18:53.333 --> 18:54.800
LET ME ADJUST THE SCULPTURE

18:54.800 --> 18:55.767
A LITTLE BIT.

18:55.767 --> 18:56.933
OKAY, I'LL JUST LEAVE HIM.

ANYWAY.

19:20.067 --> 19:21.833
[ LAUGHTER ]

19:21.833 --> 19:24.500
I APOLOGIZE IF I'VE COME ACROSS

19:24.500 --> 19:29.067
NOT AS ELOQUENT AS I HAD HOPED.
