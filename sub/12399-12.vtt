15:05.071 --> 15:07.027
It's the only way they'll learn.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.777
They need to scream so loud they can't hear.

15:10.201 --> 15:11.611
Saalim...

15:12.620 --> 15:15.157
...I know where you're coming from.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.823
It's why I'm assisting you.

15:20.253 --> 15:22.585
You're not laughing anymore.

15:22.797 --> 15:25.584
What does Amanda get
out of helping a bunch of terrorists?

15:25.758 --> 15:28.249
Why does Amanda do anything these days?

15:28.469 --> 15:29.549
You.

15:30.179 --> 15:31.794
She's trying to frame Division.

15:31.973 --> 15:35.306
You armed the Crimson Resistance
to create a panic.

15:36.352 --> 15:41.346
Their weapons are the last few I purchased
from Cyrus, your former arms dealer...

15:41.524 --> 15:44.436
...who I assure you the trail will lead
to Division's door...

15:44.652 --> 15:46.267
...unleSS you end it now.

15:48.781 --> 15:50.157
For a price.

15:52.577 --> 15:54.818
What are you gonna do with $50 million?

15:54.996 --> 15:56.827
You can't spend it from a prison cell.

15:56.998 --> 16:00.206
The real question is how much
are those innocent lives worth to you?

16:00.418 --> 16:04.707
-I don't put a price on human life.
-Then 50 million is a bargain.

16:04.922 --> 16:07.880
-Then that would be for your life as well?
-My life?

16:08.092 --> 16:13.462
Yeah. Or whatever you wanna call the rest
of your existence in a 7-by-12—foot box.

16:13.639 --> 16:17.382
Because no matter what,
you are never getting out of here.

16:32.825 --> 16:36.909
The attacker worked hiS way through the lobby.
Security cameras were scrambled.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.366
Division tech?

16:41.209 --> 16:42.915
Courtesy of Amanda.

16:45.338 --> 16:46.953
They didn't ask for this.

16:48.174 --> 16:50.290
Just got caught up in somebody else's war.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.629
Think that was the idea.

16:59.310 --> 17:00.720
It's a good kill.

17:02.188 --> 17:04.804
Simple. Still a little bit dirty.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.098
Just like Division.

17:07.401 --> 17:10.609
-Amanda's teaching them well.
-Just like Amanda taught us.

17:13.449 --> 17:15.440
Me, she just stuck with a needle.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.859
You still don't remember any of it?

17:21.123 --> 17:23.159
Part of me'S not sure I really want to.

17:24.585 --> 17:28.874
Only thing I do remember iS
Amanda said I used to be a soldier.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.168
My name was Sam.

17:35.513 --> 17:37.344
And I killed all my friends.

17:40.560 --> 17:44.803
Owen, don't let her define you.
Don't let anyone.

17:53.698 --> 17:56.485
-...and she taught them. Birkhoff.
-How'S that help us?

17:56.659 --> 17:58.820
Ari said Amanda gave the terrorists
equipment.

17:58.995 --> 18:00.986
-Maybe she gave them ghost phones.
-Yeah. 80?

18:01.163 --> 18:04.906
You said the video streaming used our
encryption Signature. Don't the phones?

18:05.084 --> 18:08.167
-YeS. We can't trace them. That's the point.
ALEX: Just go with me.

18:08.337 --> 18:12.330
Can we find any evidence of the encryption
on the cell towers around here?

18:17.555 --> 18:21.013
Okay. The call logging in the towers
at the time of the attack...

18:21.225 --> 18:23.841
...does show evidence of the encryption,
but again....

18:24.020 --> 18:28.514
We can't trace it. If they were to use the phones
and talk before the next attack...

18:28.691 --> 18:30.852
...we might trace where they'll hit next.

18:31.068 --> 18:33.605
If we jacked into every cellular
network nationwide.

18:33.821 --> 18:36.608
Are you telling me that ShadowBot
is not up to the task?

18:37.783 --> 18:39.398
Bite your tongue, princess.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.243
We do agree on one thing.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.996
What's that?

18:46.459 --> 18:48.950
You are a spy, not a terrorist.

18:50.463 --> 18:53.500
I like to get things done
without firing a shot.

18:58.054 --> 19:00.045
I had a chance to kill you once.

19:00.765 --> 19:02.221
In '06.

19:05.811 --> 19:10.100
At a basketball game. But you brought your son,
or have you forgotten?

19:10.524 --> 19:13.687
I lied to Division.
I told them that my rifle jammed.

19:14.487 --> 19:15.693
You owe me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.738
l spared your life. I took care of you.

19:22.036 --> 19:25.153
You Simply behaved exactly the way
Amanda thought you would.

19:26.666 --> 19:29.874
She called me.
She told me to bring my son to the game.

19:30.878 --> 19:35.793
She knew you'd figure out a way
to not murder me in front of him.

19:37.009 --> 19:38.795
Killer with a conscience.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.796
She told you to use your son as a prop.

19:44.141 --> 19:46.223
Was there no place she would draw the line?

19:46.852 --> 19:49.844
We both used the relationship
to our mutual benefit.

19:50.064 --> 19:52.100
She's been playing you from the jump, Ari.

19:52.274 --> 19:56.062
Every one of your plans has been derailed
by her obsession with hurting me.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.439
-Lately, yes.
-Then what are you waiting for?

19:59.156 --> 20:00.737
She ruined you.

20:01.367 --> 20:03.073
Let's bury her.

20:03.744 --> 20:07.032
All you have to do is give me the name
and we can end this now.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.198

He's not budging.
How did Alex and Owen make out?

20:22.555 --> 20:25.843
-Nothing concrete.
-Just a plan to isolate the terrorist's phones...

20:26.016 --> 20:29.554
...which is a long shot.
Our other option is to pay the son of a bitch.

20:29.770 --> 20:30.930
Let's say we did.

20:31.105 --> 20:32.891
-We ran that.
-Well, run it for me.

20:33.107 --> 20:36.224
The account Ari mentioned is on a secure VPN.
You put money in...

20:36.402 --> 20:40.065
...it gets walled off, only accessible
through a dedicated satellite uplink.

20:40.239 --> 20:43.777
We drop in the money and track it.
Birkhoff can find it through satellite.

20:43.951 --> 20:46.693
-We'll know where it's going and what it's for.
-Too risky.

20:46.871 --> 20:49.954
It's the Federal Government. It's 50 mil.
A drop in the bucket.

20:50.124 --> 20:52.866
It would be if we were actually funded
by the government.

20:54.086 --> 20:55.417
What are you talking about?

20:55.588 --> 20:58.921

earmarks for Division.

flowing into this place.

21:04.555 --> 21:06.216
How do we have an operating budget?

21:06.432 --> 21:08.263
We received some seed money...

21:08.434 --> 21:11.926
...which I grew into a sizable pile of cash
with Birkhoff's help.

21:12.563 --> 21:14.053
Nothing illegal.

21:14.523 --> 21:17.936
The point is, our operating budget
is currently 53.6 million.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.387
I'm sorry.

30:12.853 --> 30:17.096
Guys, listen up. I think I just caught a whiff
of our encryption on a local cell network.

30:17.316 --> 30:19.056
[OVER COMM]
You Should be right on top of it.

30:27.367 --> 30:31.736
Ops, we may have something.

30:40.881 --> 30:42.587
I'm gonna get out. Keep driving past.

30:42.841 --> 30:44.502
The target is in sight.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.929
-Where are they?
WOMAN: They are inside. I go now.

31:00.567 --> 31:02.774
Drop your weapon.

31:08.575 --> 31:09.781
Something's wrong.

31:10.452 --> 31:13.034
Where is he?
Where is the man who gives you orders?

31:15.332 --> 31:17.618
Where is the man who gives you orders?

31:20.796 --> 31:23.287
The attacks will keep coming
if we don't break him.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.376
He should have broken by now.

31:25.550 --> 31:28.883
-Maybe he's greedier than we thought.
-He's not gonna take this abuse.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.761
Doesn't matter how much money
he thinks he's gonna make.

31:32.349 --> 31:36.217
What is he holding out for?
What would you hold out for?

31:36.978 --> 31:38.138
You.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.474
-Seriously.
-I am serious.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.808
The only reason to hold out
is for someone you love.

31:43.985 --> 31:48.103
Say he loved Amanda is a stretch.
And she left him anyway...

31:48.281 --> 31:50.442
...so who does he have that....

31:53.370 --> 31:54.780
What?

31:59.668 --> 32:02.751
It's for Stefan. That's who the money's for.

32:10.095 --> 32:11.835
You're holding out for your son.

32:22.190 --> 32:24.772
I'm trying to give my son a life.

32:25.068 --> 32:27.775
A real life, away from all of this.

32:27.946 --> 32:29.857
Fifty million.

32:30.031 --> 32:31.441
That's quite a golden ticket.

32:31.616 --> 32:36.076
The money is for a trust,
and for his caretaker.

32:36.455 --> 32:42.246
An elite operative who will protect him
from the likes of you or Amanda.

32:42.419 --> 32:43.829
You should have told us.

32:44.045 --> 32:45.376
We would have protected him.

32:45.547 --> 32:47.287
So you could use him against me?

32:47.507 --> 32:50.044
Or use us both as a lure to catch Amanda?

32:50.260 --> 32:51.670
I wouldn't have done that.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.673
You're my sworn enemy, Nikita.

32:54.890 --> 32:57.597
Forgive me if I didn't give you
the benefit of the doubt.

32:57.767 --> 33:01.806
Right, so instead you traded on innocent lives,
like your son's--

33:01.980 --> 33:06.019
He didn't ask for any of this.
He certainly didn't choose his birthright.

33:09.696 --> 33:12.187
You didn't have a plan to get out of here,
did you?

33:15.076 --> 33:19.570
You ask me what I call my future existence
in a 7-by-12-foot box?

33:19.748 --> 33:23.206
I call it my fate. And I accept it.

33:26.087 --> 33:29.250
All right. Then accept this.

33:30.467 --> 33:33.254
We are not funded
by the government anymore.

33:34.596 --> 33:36.587
I don't have that kind of money.

33:38.183 --> 33:42.096
And if your caretaker is not paid,
the only thing standing between your son...

33:42.270 --> 33:45.808
...and Amanda's retribution is me.

33:54.366 --> 33:55.697
[CHUCKLES]

34:06.753 --> 34:08.618
The terrorist's name...

34:10.131 --> 34:11.746
...is Saalim Nassar.

34:14.135 --> 34:15.875
A Yemeni-born American citizen...

34:16.054 --> 34:18.841
...he was visiting his home country
when a stray bullet...

34:19.015 --> 34:22.303
...from an American raid
struck and killed his only daughter.

34:22.477 --> 34:25.890
I don't have his location,
but I have his personal phone number.

34:26.356 --> 34:28.642
Division should be able to trace it.

34:40.245 --> 34:44.079
You said they wouldn't find us
and I hear one of my people killed on the line!

34:44.249 --> 34:46.490
-Something's happened.
-You heard them.

34:46.710 --> 34:48.200
Who could they have been?

34:48.712 --> 34:50.418
One of your people made a mistake.

34:50.630 --> 34:53.121
We didn't do anything different.
This is your fault.

34:53.300 --> 34:54.710
The equipment is sound.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.542
Then someone's helping them.

34:57.971 --> 35:01.759
It can't be on my side.
I don't pick the target until the last minute.

35:03.059 --> 35:05.596
Someone on your side is helping them.

35:06.980 --> 35:08.140
Am I wrong?

35:08.315 --> 35:10.476
Saalim, there are no sides here.

35:10.692 --> 35:12.398
My cause is your cause.

35:12.569 --> 35:15.561
And the world knows exactly who
the Crimson Resistance is.

35:18.992 --> 35:23.702
It's not enough.
There needs to be at least three.

35:28.501 --> 35:29.627
You're right.

35:30.837 --> 35:33.704
We'll broadcast sooner before
the next attack.

35:34.299 --> 35:38.087
Keep them terrified, off balance,
the way they should be.

35:42.932 --> 35:46.060
We got him. Birkhoff tracked his phone.
In an apartment on the Upper West Side.

35:46.269 --> 35:47.304
Grab team?

35:49.606 --> 35:51.142
-Good.
BIRKHOFF: Not good.

35:51.358 --> 35:52.643
What is it?

35:52.817 --> 35:56.401
News outlets are receiving
another live broadcast.

35:56.780 --> 36:00.614
SAALIM: Some people say we Should stop.
We will not.

36:00.825 --> 36:04.943
-Birkhoff, now that we know where he is--
-I know. I know. Tapping the local Wi-Fi.

36:05.747 --> 36:08.409
As I speak, another attack is being prepared.

36:09.334 --> 36:13.077
When I am finished,
I will signal them to continue.

36:13.296 --> 36:15.878
-Owen and Alex won't make it.
-Can we shut him off?

36:16.091 --> 36:19.879
I got a better idea. Birkhoff.
Let's hack into this guy's software.

36:20.095 --> 36:25.055
Copy that. Time for Toto
to pull the curtain back on the wizard.

36:25.225 --> 36:28.342
SAALIM: Only then will your voice
be the one your leaders hear.

36:28.812 --> 36:32.225
We will not stop until this
policy is changed...

36:32.399 --> 36:34.606
...until we put an end to random,
indiscriminate murder.

This is the frame-up Ari was talking about.

36:53.586 --> 36:56.828
Hello. Is this the counter-terrorism section?

36:57.966 --> 36:59.957
l have a very important tip for you.

37:12.480 --> 37:14.311
AGENT 1:
Clear.

37:16.109 --> 37:18.475
AGENT 2: All clear.
-Ops, we're clear.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.894
BIRKHOFF: You'd better get cracking.
FBI's on the way.

37:25.994 --> 37:29.077
Are you sure this is gonna erase
every trace of Division off this computer?

37:29.247 --> 37:32.489
Super clean, baby. Just like you like it.

37:32.959 --> 37:34.039
I'll clean the rest.

37:39.758 --> 37:42.420
Nikki. Nikki.

37:42.635 --> 37:45.342
We've got an encrypted phone call. It's her.

37:46.347 --> 37:48.008
We got it upstairs.

37:49.684 --> 37:51.015
Yeah.

37:51.186 --> 37:54.929
Word on the street is Ari Tasarov's
been picked up by Federal Agents.

37:55.148 --> 37:56.763
Don't believe everything you hear.

and I know he's helping you.

NIKITA: Is that why you called,
to conﬁrm a rumor?

38:02.739 --> 38:04.855
| just have one question. Why the delay?

38:05.033 --> 38:07.194
You couldn't get Saalim's name out of him?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.025
I didn't need to. You did that.

38:09.662 --> 38:11.789
I'm a hero. Just like you.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.250
Oh, Amanda. You are gonna pay
for the lives you took.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.536
AMANDA:
You had a chance to kill me before...

38:19.756 --> 38:22.873
-...but for some reason you didn't.
NIKITA: That was a mistake.

38:23.301 --> 38:25.633
I guess I have a target on my back now...

38:26.721 --> 38:28.302

...just like Stefan.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.766

38:35.897 --> 38:37.728
You leave that boy out of this.

38:39.108 --> 38:40.689
Ari betrayed me.

38:41.694 --> 38:43.195
The boy is fair game.

39:01.089 --> 39:03.455
Something has to be done.

39:03.675 --> 39:04.664
It Will.

39:04.843 --> 39:08.506
You're gonna sit down and give us
all the details of Amanda's operation.

39:08.847 --> 39:11.008
Names, dates, everything.

39:11.599 --> 39:14.511
And if this protector of yours
is as good as you say he is...

39:14.727 --> 39:18.185
...then Stefan will be fine
until the current deposit runs out.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.567
Shortly after Amanda's betrayal...

39:25.864 --> 39:28.776
...I found myself alone, riding the subways.

39:29.492 --> 39:32.029
I ran through every possible scenario...

39:32.495 --> 39:35.612
...and I realized I was in a place
I had never been.

39:38.126 --> 39:40.242

39:42.380 --> 39:46.293
I've been there.
It tends to change your priorities.

39:47.343 --> 39:50.380
Yes, well, it suddenly became
very clear to me...

39:51.556 --> 39:54.673
...the only thing worth fighting for
was my son.

39:56.394 --> 39:59.306
Which is why I did what I had to do,
and no...

40:01.024 --> 40:03.390
...I don't expect you to understand.

40:04.819 --> 40:06.025
But I do.

The difference is I'm not gonna lose myself
in the process because if] do...

40:23.880 --> 40:25.791
And I am not gonna let that happen.

40:28.676 --> 40:30.587

40:30.803 --> 40:33.840
FBI thinks Saalim was killed by
one of his comrades, so...

40:34.057 --> 40:36.343
...we are safely back in the shadows.

40:36.726 --> 40:37.715
You all right?

40:39.354 --> 40:41.686
They were together for 20 years.

40:42.357 --> 40:43.938
It was all a charade.

40:45.360 --> 40:47.225
But it was Amanda. How could it not be?
