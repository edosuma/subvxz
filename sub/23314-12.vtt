00:00.001 --> 00:02.127
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:03.699 --> 00:06.800
Black Lightning's the reason
you're lying here paralyzed.

00:06.803 --> 00:09.804
If you'd like, I can show
you how to kill your pain.

00:09.807 --> 00:12.273
- Maybe we should take a break.
- Until what?

00:12.276 --> 00:13.351
I walk?

00:13.354 --> 00:14.664
You slippin', Lala.

00:14.667 --> 00:16.683
You walking around here
talking to yourself.

00:16.686 --> 00:18.286
Man, we all see you.

00:19.921 --> 00:22.023
Anybody else think I
ain't built for this?

00:22.026 --> 00:24.167
Uncle Gambi discovered the
bodies of a bunch of kids

00:24.170 --> 00:25.469
who disappeared 30 years ago.

00:25.472 --> 00:27.161
He thought they were
dead, but they're alive,

00:27.163 --> 00:28.963
and they're kept in some
kind of suspended state.

00:28.965 --> 00:30.968
No, they were here.

00:30.971 --> 00:34.562
Some large objects were
dragged out the door.

00:34.565 --> 00:36.312
Are they all stable after the move?

00:36.315 --> 00:39.328
Thank you for my latest addition.

00:39.331 --> 00:41.911
I don't wanna have powers.
I don't wanna save the world.

00:44.254 --> 00:45.687
You're just like Dad.

00:46.577 --> 00:48.376
You gotta be kidding me.

00:49.782 --> 00:51.048
Tobias!

00:53.432 --> 00:55.265
Tori!

00:55.268 --> 00:56.508
Stay with me.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:38.046 --> 01:41.180
We're glad to have you back, Mr. Whale.

01:43.952 --> 01:45.690
How are you feeling?

01:45.693 --> 01:50.433
Recovered from your injuries,
I see. They were pretty bad.

01:50.436 --> 01:53.052
Black Lightning really
tried to barbecue you, huh?

01:54.963 --> 01:56.429
You people.

01:56.432 --> 01:59.612
I appreciate the excellent
medical care you provided.

01:59.623 --> 02:04.011
You're important to us, especially
now that Lady Eve is gone.

02:04.014 --> 02:06.472
Her death is a tragedy to everyone.

02:06.474 --> 02:08.007
Yes.

02:09.043 --> 02:11.878
And now there's a vacancy.

02:12.918 --> 02:15.885
How much do you know
about her operations?

02:15.888 --> 02:18.089
Well, let's just say she
helped the citizens of Freeland

02:18.092 --> 02:21.420
find happiness by muting the
pain of their deprivation.

02:21.422 --> 02:24.724
Is that what drug
dealers tell themselves?

02:25.927 --> 02:27.881
You and I have never
worked together directly,

02:27.884 --> 02:32.364
so being cautious with
my words seemed wise.

02:35.336 --> 02:38.871
Years ago, in a very

02:38.873 --> 02:43.342
racially and
politically-charged environment,

02:43.344 --> 02:45.211
we developed a chemical
we hoped would make

02:45.213 --> 02:48.214
the citizens of Freeland docile,

02:48.216 --> 02:52.862
so we could, for lack of a
better word, control them.

02:52.865 --> 02:54.187
It didn't work.

02:55.290 --> 03:02.261
Instead, it gave some of
them meta-human abilities.

03:03.563 --> 03:06.364
- A side effect with strategic implications.
- Hmm.

03:06.367 --> 03:08.167
Yeah. Meaning in a dangerous situation,

03:08.170 --> 03:11.870
a few local folks fight and die,

03:11.873 --> 03:14.840
saving the lives of
some fancy white boys.

03:14.842 --> 03:17.343
Only, it turns out,

03:17.345 --> 03:21.881
all our subjects began dying
before they were fully operational.

03:21.883 --> 03:24.684
Some flaw in the syrup.

03:25.653 --> 03:28.087
We kept working at it and...

03:28.089 --> 03:29.522
You created Green Light.

03:30.835 --> 03:34.237
The users I saw had super
strength, high pain tolerance,

03:34.240 --> 03:35.939
no flight instinct.

03:36.664 --> 03:38.898
And if that doesn't say Marine...

03:40.108 --> 03:43.011
Our yields are higher now than
they were with the vaccine,

03:43.014 --> 03:45.271
but the survival rate is no better.

03:45.274 --> 03:49.875
So I need you to find Black Lightning.

03:51.045 --> 03:52.612
Excuse me?

03:52.615 --> 03:56.983
I have come to believe he
is a product of the vaccine.

03:56.985 --> 04:00.418
And yet, he lives,

04:00.421 --> 04:01.581
has lived.

04:01.584 --> 04:04.191
I need him for research purposes,

04:04.194 --> 04:07.928
before all of my subjects
die and the experiment fails.

04:09.731 --> 04:13.032
So bring him to me.

04:14.802 --> 04:16.880
- Alive.
- Hmm.

04:16.884 --> 04:20.473
And you're going to need some help.

04:21.809 --> 04:25.711
I finished the project you were
working on before you got hurt.

04:39.761 --> 04:41.394
Hello, Khalil.

04:42.264 --> 04:43.529
Mr. Whale.

04:55.831 --> 04:58.665
Alive, Mr. Whale!

04:59.480 --> 05:03.249
I need Black Lightning alive!

05:07.413 --> 05:09.534
- Hey. Yeah.
- Jeff?

05:09.537 --> 05:11.223
I need your help.

05:11.225 --> 05:12.458
Everything okay?

05:12.460 --> 05:15.779
- Yeah. Just come over, please.
- Okay.

05:22.070 --> 05:24.175
Hello?

05:24.178 --> 05:28.240
Everything... okay?

05:28.242 --> 05:29.542
Yeah.

05:29.544 --> 05:34.613
I just came out of the
shower, and there was a spider.

05:37.552 --> 05:39.051
Ah.

05:39.053 --> 05:40.353
A spider?

05:40.855 --> 05:44.123
Yeah. Somewhere.

06:11.378 --> 06:12.644
Mmm.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.522
Damn.

06:16.524 --> 06:18.557
I like it when you do that.

06:18.559 --> 06:20.292
Yeah?

06:20.294 --> 06:21.394
Yeah.

06:27.262 --> 06:32.287
- <font color="#D81D1D">Synced and corrected by VitoSilans</font> -
-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

06:39.747 --> 06:41.220
What happened?

06:43.017 --> 06:46.185
After everything we've been
through these last few months,

06:47.321 --> 06:49.553
you returning to the suit,

06:50.491 --> 06:53.325
Anissa's powers, Jennifer's powers,

06:54.095 --> 06:55.728
Gambi's confession...

06:55.730 --> 06:58.659
Is this supposed to be sexy?

06:58.662 --> 07:01.967
'Cause, if so, I have some notes.

07:02.804 --> 07:06.573
No. I... I realized that if my issue

07:06.576 --> 07:08.761
with Black Lightning was the stress,

07:08.764 --> 07:11.276
everything that's happened
should have sent me running

07:11.279 --> 07:13.712
as far away from you as possible.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.552
I feel closer to you than ever.

07:20.054 --> 07:21.153
Hmm.

07:22.831 --> 07:27.567
Who'd have thought I just needed to
make things worse to get you back?

07:30.364 --> 07:31.630
I love you.

07:33.501 --> 07:35.475
I've loved you a long time.

07:37.638 --> 07:39.405
Ignoring that seems stupid.

07:40.842 --> 07:42.475
I love you, too.

07:45.213 --> 07:47.112
- But...
- Oh.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.849
No, uh...

07:51.153 --> 07:53.253
I don't think we should
say anything to the girls.

07:53.256 --> 07:54.854
They're dealing with so much.

07:56.324 --> 07:59.158
I want us to be sure
before we tell them.

08:02.210 --> 08:05.512
We just keep it a secret.

08:05.515 --> 08:07.782
Like we're having an affair.

08:11.621 --> 08:14.455
I'm in.

08:26.521 --> 08:27.987
Dwayne.

08:27.989 --> 08:29.522
Mr. Whale.

08:32.226 --> 08:35.006
I just wanted to thank
you for savin' my life.

08:36.364 --> 08:37.663
Mmm.

08:38.566 --> 08:40.099
In the chaos of the night,

08:40.101 --> 08:42.368
you were brave enough
to pull me to safety.

08:42.371 --> 08:43.967
And I can appreciate that.

08:43.971 --> 08:45.404
You're welcome, sir.

08:48.676 --> 08:50.381
But you left my sister.

08:54.448 --> 08:56.682
And left Tori to die.

08:57.685 --> 08:59.818
If I went back, they
would've gotten you, too.

08:59.820 --> 09:00.853
Look, and...

09:00.855 --> 09:03.956
You left her to die.

09:14.335 --> 09:15.990
You're so impulsive.

09:23.885 --> 09:26.772
It feels good to be back.

09:34.956 --> 09:36.655
Khalil?

09:42.063 --> 09:43.128
You're...

09:43.130 --> 09:44.296
Walking.

09:45.199 --> 09:47.132
Yeah, I know.

09:47.134 --> 09:48.858
It's amazing.

09:50.504 --> 09:52.037
A miracle, actually.

09:53.850 --> 09:56.050
- Really happy for you.
- Ah.

09:56.053 --> 09:59.545
It seems like you have
yourself a new look.

10:01.015 --> 10:05.584
So, uh, I guess this means you'll
be coming back to school soon, right?

10:06.787 --> 10:08.451
Nah, man.

10:08.454 --> 10:11.223
Nah, snakes treated me like dirt
when I was in that chair, so...

10:11.225 --> 10:13.692
I don't think so.

10:14.444 --> 10:16.326
Okay, look. I know
you've had a hard time,

10:17.412 --> 10:20.366
but that doesn't mean you
should abandon your education.

10:20.368 --> 10:22.635
Man, are you, uh...

10:22.637 --> 10:26.073
You're really gonna do the
whole education pitch right now?

10:26.076 --> 10:27.229
Really?

10:29.276 --> 10:30.909
Good talk, Mr. P.

10:30.911 --> 10:32.878
- I hope you change your mind.
- I won't.

10:32.880 --> 10:34.803
Look, let me ask you something.

10:34.806 --> 10:36.139
Um...

10:37.418 --> 10:41.086
What kind of procedure
got you back on your feet?

10:42.490 --> 10:43.856
Why you wanna know?

10:43.858 --> 10:48.594
Well, because while I'm very
happy that you're walking,

10:49.904 --> 10:53.659
we both know that someone pulled
the strings to make that happen.

10:53.662 --> 10:56.635
And I wanna make sure you're
not being taken advantage of.

11:04.912 --> 11:07.946
Man, you really are in
your own little world, huh?

11:10.092 --> 11:11.769
I'm walking, bruh.

11:11.772 --> 11:14.019
How is that takin' advantage of me?

11:15.089 --> 11:16.722
And you know what? Stop.

11:17.558 --> 11:20.325
Stop with that surrogate daddy act.

11:20.987 --> 11:22.687
You don't care about me.

11:24.015 --> 11:26.448
I was just another little,
poor kid from Freeland

11:26.451 --> 11:28.500
for you to parade around
in front of everybody

11:28.502 --> 11:30.536
to make you and Garfield look good.

11:30.538 --> 11:32.805
- That is so not true.
- Yes, it is!

11:35.142 --> 11:38.243
As soon as my black ass
couldn't run no more,

11:41.148 --> 11:42.347
where were you?

11:44.886 --> 11:47.373
You wouldn't even let
your daughter near me.

11:53.794 --> 11:55.615
Where is the future, Mr. P?

11:57.765 --> 11:59.272
It's right here.

12:06.543 --> 12:08.513
- Walking?
- Yes.

12:08.515 --> 12:12.184
With no kind of assistance.
No cane, no braces.

12:12.186 --> 12:14.786
I've read about implants
in rats with severed spines,

12:14.788 --> 12:17.956
but I thought we were a long way
from putting those in a human being,

12:17.958 --> 12:20.725
let alone a poor teenager from Feland.

12:20.727 --> 12:22.360
It's a billion-dollar technology, right?

12:22.362 --> 12:23.995
At least.

12:23.997 --> 12:26.198
It stinks of Proctor and the ASA.

12:26.200 --> 12:30.168
Just another experiment being
run on some young black kid.

12:30.170 --> 12:32.838
I found one more in
the newspaper archive.

12:33.907 --> 12:36.341
Okay, that's a total of 42 kids missing.

12:36.344 --> 12:38.076
Plus Neema.

12:38.078 --> 12:40.745
Wait, you only saw
three dozen pods, right?

12:40.747 --> 12:43.582
Does that mean seven are dead?

12:44.348 --> 12:46.618
I have no way to know that, Jefferson.

12:46.620 --> 12:48.453
It can't be easy keeping them stable,

12:48.455 --> 12:50.021
especially if they have to move them.

12:50.023 --> 12:52.123
We need to find these
kids before the ASA

12:52.125 --> 12:54.292
- decides to relocate them again.
- Yeah.

12:54.294 --> 12:58.196
Catching Proctor is the best
way for us to shut this down.

13:00.262 --> 13:02.500
Well, if we're right about Khalil,

13:02.502 --> 13:04.102
he might lead me to Proctor.

13:04.104 --> 13:06.520
- I mean, he might not know enough not to.
- Hmm.

13:06.523 --> 13:08.871
And I've got one more
lead to follow up on.

13:08.874 --> 13:10.908
Hidalgo, the weapons maker.

13:10.911 --> 13:12.444
What? The guy who lied to you?

13:12.446 --> 13:15.614
My mistake. I won't make it again.

13:15.616 --> 13:19.251
Now, Proctor won't have given
up on finding Black Lightning.

13:19.253 --> 13:22.621
And even if he thinks you're not
him, I bet he thinks you know him.

13:22.623 --> 13:24.489
He'll be watching.

13:24.491 --> 13:27.887
And he'll be looking for Thunder,
too, Anissa, so be careful.

13:29.730 --> 13:30.929
Oh, Gambi?

13:32.766 --> 13:35.528
- Proctor'll be looking for you, too.
- Yeah.

13:35.531 --> 13:37.435
But this old man's not
gonna save the world,

13:37.437 --> 13:40.739
so if he catches me,
it's not as big a deal.

13:44.744 --> 13:47.918
Having enhanced abilities
doesn't have to change anything.

13:47.921 --> 13:49.281
Oh, really?

13:49.283 --> 13:51.483
So I should join a team
but not try too hard,

13:51.485 --> 13:54.219
because the competition
might set me on fire.

13:54.222 --> 13:56.778
Okay, maybe not a team.

13:56.781 --> 13:58.329
Well, what about Debate?

13:58.332 --> 14:00.525
'Cause nothing is more
calming than alternative views

14:00.527 --> 14:02.762
on abortion and social services.

14:02.765 --> 14:06.426
Well, there's always needlepoint.

14:06.429 --> 14:09.433
Hey, you're right. I can make a
pillow that says, "My parents had sex,

14:09.436 --> 14:11.670
and all I got was superpowers."

14:11.672 --> 14:14.012
- It's not funny.
- It's a little bit funny.

14:14.015 --> 14:17.475
Look, we just need to figure out
how to help you to control them.

14:17.478 --> 14:20.379
And if it makes you feel any
better, I have made a little progress

14:20.382 --> 14:22.537
in isolating the gene
that I think is responsible

14:22.540 --> 14:24.397
for your enhanced abilities.

14:24.400 --> 14:26.433
Suppressing it is the first step.

14:28.980 --> 14:31.723
Thank God I was born
to such a smart woman

14:31.725 --> 14:33.558
and not some slacker who would just...

14:33.560 --> 14:35.760
try and make me feel
better by making me a cake.

14:35.763 --> 14:37.496
Do you want me to bake you a cake?

14:37.499 --> 14:39.715
Yes, please. Chocolate
with cream cheese frosting.

14:40.550 --> 14:41.916
Chocolate it is.

14:47.823 --> 14:48.856
Mrs. Payne.

14:48.859 --> 14:51.508
- Mr. Jefferson. How are you?
- I'm good.

14:51.511 --> 14:53.311
I'm good. Is Khalil home?

14:53.314 --> 14:55.410
No. He's in California.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.416
What?

14:59.419 --> 15:01.319
I saw him this morning.

15:02.378 --> 15:03.744
Oh.

15:03.747 --> 15:05.113
I didn't know.

15:05.859 --> 15:07.558
How was he?

15:08.650 --> 15:10.016
Walking.

15:12.887 --> 15:14.287
Come in.

15:16.069 --> 15:18.176
I'm sorry.

15:18.179 --> 15:21.305
Uh, do you mind me
asking how it happened?

15:21.308 --> 15:23.074
The spinal implant?

15:23.076 --> 15:24.776
Uh, yeah. Yes.

15:25.746 --> 15:28.611
A hospital administrator came by.

15:28.614 --> 15:32.650
He said Khalil was chosen,
uh, for a pilot program.

15:34.109 --> 15:35.408
Do you remember his name?

15:36.387 --> 15:38.023
A Mr. Martin.

15:38.809 --> 15:40.340
He said there was a risk of infection,

15:40.343 --> 15:43.926
and I couldn't be with Khalil
while he was being treated.

15:44.996 --> 15:47.798
And that I should stay in Freeland.

15:47.801 --> 15:50.556
I didn't want my boy to go by himself,

15:50.559 --> 15:52.470
but our doctor signed off and I...

15:52.472 --> 15:55.006
- Khalil wanted to.
- Yeah.

15:56.676 --> 15:59.978
He hasn't talked to me
since he's been there.

15:59.980 --> 16:02.251
And now he's back?

16:02.254 --> 16:05.517
Well, I think the injury was
a lot for him to deal with.

16:05.527 --> 16:08.895
But he never would've gotten
through it without you.

16:11.391 --> 16:13.512
Can I have Mr. Martin's number?

16:13.515 --> 16:16.153
Of course. I'll get it.

16:30.677 --> 16:33.545
Hey, Tommy. Come on in.

16:35.348 --> 16:36.848
That's far enough.

16:36.851 --> 16:38.239
I like this.

16:38.242 --> 16:41.151
It's got a retro feel you don't
usually get in a high-capacity weapon.

16:41.154 --> 16:42.676
I'm impressed you got in.

16:42.679 --> 16:45.626
I had to beef up the security
system after our last meeting.

16:45.629 --> 16:47.359
All right, so you're smart
enough to know I'd be back,

16:47.361 --> 16:48.983
but you're not smart enough
to know how to stop me.

16:48.985 --> 16:51.119
Look, I didn't lie to you last time.

16:51.122 --> 16:53.197
True. But you didn't tell
me what I wanted to know.

16:53.200 --> 16:54.473
I still can't.

16:54.476 --> 16:56.133
So, if you want to
kill me, just kill me.

16:56.136 --> 16:58.301
Talking about it doesn't make it easier.

17:00.740 --> 17:02.507
I'm not gonna kill you, Tommy.

17:02.510 --> 17:05.242
But I am gonna put a
target on your back,

17:05.246 --> 17:08.114
so every person you've ever
double-crossed can find you.

17:08.117 --> 17:09.751
I'll let one of them torture you in ways

17:09.753 --> 17:11.281
I just don't have the
stomach for anymore.

17:11.284 --> 17:12.714
Come on, Gambi.

17:12.718 --> 17:15.586
Honestly, I don't know who bought
the weapon that killed Lady Eve.

17:15.589 --> 17:17.637
I want Proctor.

17:17.640 --> 17:19.073
Don't play dumb.

17:19.076 --> 17:22.727
You work for the government all the
time. I wanna know how to find him.

17:22.729 --> 17:24.729
You want to get to him
before he gets to you?

17:24.731 --> 17:26.631
I heard you were on the outs.

17:28.535 --> 17:30.001
You got 48 hours.

17:30.003 --> 17:31.202
Move.

17:41.199 --> 17:43.520
The music helps me study, I swear.

17:50.925 --> 17:52.725
I saw Khalil today.

17:55.089 --> 17:57.055
And he's walking again.

17:58.406 --> 17:59.405
What?

17:59.408 --> 18:01.132
Dad, the doctors said
it wasn't possible.

18:01.134 --> 18:02.467
Yeah, I know.

18:02.470 --> 18:03.670
Oh, my God.

18:03.673 --> 18:05.702
Oh, my God, I gotta
find him and talk to him.

18:05.705 --> 18:07.305
No. No, no, no.

18:07.307 --> 18:09.541
No. You need to stay away.

18:10.348 --> 18:13.044
From Khalil? Why?

18:13.046 --> 18:15.513
He is not the same person.

18:17.077 --> 18:19.771
Dad, look. I understand you're mad
because of the way he treated me.

18:19.774 --> 18:22.475
No, no, no. He looks different.

18:22.478 --> 18:24.344
He acts different.

18:25.395 --> 18:28.463
And I think he's gotten
himself involved with...

18:30.597 --> 18:34.165
With people who are
looking for kids like you.

18:34.168 --> 18:35.739
Why do you think that?

18:37.311 --> 18:39.545
The medical technology he's gotten,

18:39.548 --> 18:41.978
it's not easy to come by.

18:41.981 --> 18:44.184
- Does it matter?
- Yes. It matters.

18:44.187 --> 18:46.598
Dad, I get what you're sayin',
but Khalil wouldn't hurt me.

18:46.601 --> 18:48.668
Okay, look. This is
not just about Khalil.

18:48.671 --> 18:50.181
It's about the decisions he's made

18:50.183 --> 18:54.219
and the people he is
possibly involved with.

18:57.903 --> 18:59.503
Stay away.

19:06.207 --> 19:09.075
I can't wait until Mom
figures out how to fix me.

19:10.310 --> 19:12.777
I'm sick of this powers' drama.

19:15.332 --> 19:17.332
Your mother... what?

19:18.845 --> 19:22.447
She's isolating this
meta-gene so she can stop it.

19:22.450 --> 19:24.951
I can finally be me again.

19:38.116 --> 19:39.549
Khalil?

19:49.221 --> 19:52.832
Are you trying to isolate
Jennifer's meta-gene?

19:53.645 --> 19:57.382
I've done some preliminary research
to understand what's happening.

19:57.385 --> 20:00.332
So you could suppress the mutation?

20:00.335 --> 20:02.452
She's conflicted about her powers.

20:02.455 --> 20:04.889
I don't see any reason not
to explore all the options.

20:04.891 --> 20:06.524
It's who she is!

20:06.527 --> 20:08.306
Jeff, I'm not the enemy.

20:08.309 --> 20:10.056
You're trying to change her

20:10.059 --> 20:12.103
and treating her like she's sick.

20:12.106 --> 20:14.235
Okay, so is Anissa sick?

20:14.238 --> 20:15.360
Am I?

20:15.363 --> 20:16.900
No. That's not what I...

20:16.903 --> 20:19.978
I mean, how could you do
this without talking to me?

20:25.407 --> 20:27.381
You know, I think it's really good

20:27.384 --> 20:30.148
that we didn't tell the girls
that we're getting back together.

20:58.167 --> 21:01.135
You know, I've been
waiting about an hour...

21:01.137 --> 21:02.703
thinking that you'd come home.

21:04.040 --> 21:05.439
Girl, where've you been?

21:06.876 --> 21:09.089
We've actually been
staying someplace else.

21:12.248 --> 21:13.714
Vermin.

21:15.117 --> 21:16.951
Gross.

21:16.953 --> 21:19.153
Well, look. I wanted you to be first...

21:21.490 --> 21:23.557
to see that I'm finally walking again.

21:23.559 --> 21:25.459
Oh, my God!

21:26.963 --> 21:28.550
This is crazy.

21:30.399 --> 21:32.266
I'm... I'm happy for you.

21:35.503 --> 21:39.205
Look. I've been feelin' really bad

21:39.208 --> 21:41.609
about the way things ended between us.

21:43.079 --> 21:44.412
Yeah. Me, too.

21:45.152 --> 21:47.363
J, I know it's not an excuse,

21:47.366 --> 21:52.472
but when I couldn't walk or run
no more, I didn't know who I was.

21:54.891 --> 21:56.357
But look...

22:02.098 --> 22:03.836
Cool, isn't it?

22:03.839 --> 22:08.563
I mean... And look, I'm the
first person to ever get this.

22:08.566 --> 22:10.471
Wow.

22:10.473 --> 22:12.306
- Really the first?
- Yeah.

22:12.309 --> 22:14.975
You know, it hurt like
hell in the beginning.

22:14.984 --> 22:18.914
I mean, it felt like my
legs were, like, electrified.

22:18.917 --> 22:20.246
You weren't scared?

22:20.249 --> 22:23.050
Like, yeah. I mean, at the beginning.

22:23.052 --> 22:25.252
I mean, I had doctors poking at me,

22:25.254 --> 22:26.820
making all these scrunched up faces.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.657
Hell, I didn't know if it
was working or not. But...

22:31.260 --> 22:32.493
But it worked.

22:32.495 --> 22:34.370
It worked, man. It really did.

22:35.019 --> 22:38.465
And the dreads, was
this part of the deal?

22:38.467 --> 22:42.636
Oh. Nah. Nah, they gave me some pills

22:42.638 --> 22:46.907
uh, to help with the regeneration.

22:46.909 --> 22:51.111
And, uh, it just made
my hair grow really fast.

22:51.113 --> 22:53.180
I figured I'd just do something new.

22:54.483 --> 22:56.283
Well, um...

22:56.285 --> 22:58.519
it looks very mature.

23:04.727 --> 23:05.902
Um...

23:07.930 --> 23:10.731
So, how'd they pick
you for the procedure?

23:12.702 --> 23:14.435
Uh...

23:16.340 --> 23:18.058
Does that really matter?

23:18.941 --> 23:20.658
Oh, I don't know.

23:20.661 --> 23:22.094
It might.

23:29.418 --> 23:30.651
Oh.

23:32.154 --> 23:34.021
Okay.

23:34.757 --> 23:36.290
I get it.

23:36.292 --> 23:38.092
Now this is coming from your pops, huh?

23:38.094 --> 23:39.860
Oh. No. Hey, Khalil.

23:39.863 --> 23:41.695
Damn it, man.

23:41.697 --> 23:45.165
J, I came here first to see
if we could get back together

23:45.167 --> 23:47.134
now that I got everything straight.

23:47.137 --> 23:49.203
But all I'm getting is shade from you

23:49.205 --> 23:51.238
about who did what and why.

23:53.876 --> 23:55.269
Forget it.

23:55.272 --> 23:57.105
You know what?

23:57.108 --> 23:58.672
I'm better without your ass anyway.

23:58.675 --> 24:00.080
Khalil.

24:08.357 --> 24:11.358
Okay, look, why the hell would
I wanna go back to Garfield High?

24:11.360 --> 24:14.962
I know you got a lot of feelings
about Garfield, but this is business,

24:14.965 --> 24:18.097
and you need to put your
feelings aside for the moment.

24:19.135 --> 24:21.602
Our job is to catch Black Lightning.

24:22.872 --> 24:26.006
Not kill him, catch him.

24:27.276 --> 24:29.410
Okay, but why Garfield?

24:30.642 --> 24:32.175
Think, Khalil.

24:32.940 --> 24:34.973
What does Black Lightning do?

24:37.119 --> 24:39.753
- Beats people's asses.
- Hmm.

24:39.756 --> 24:41.308
Whose asses?

24:41.311 --> 24:43.190
Bad guys' asses.

24:43.192 --> 24:44.925
Okay, and why?

24:44.928 --> 24:46.928
To stop them...

24:53.201 --> 24:55.435
To stop them from hurting people.

24:55.438 --> 24:57.604
Exactly.

24:57.606 --> 24:59.339
So danger at Garfield,

24:59.341 --> 25:02.743
the crown jewel of
Freeland, is like catnip.

25:03.986 --> 25:06.486
You're gonna go in there and
draw Black Lightning out. Got it?

25:07.550 --> 25:08.949
Got it.

25:08.952 --> 25:13.367
There's a part of you, I know,
that wants his old life back.

25:13.370 --> 25:16.183
I even heard you tried to
get your old girlfriend back.

25:18.686 --> 25:20.034
But you made a deal, son.

25:22.064 --> 25:24.098
Legs for loyalty.

25:24.733 --> 25:26.784
So, Garfield,

25:26.787 --> 25:28.620
that girl...

25:29.839 --> 25:31.872
They belong to the past now.

25:32.908 --> 25:35.442
I want you to remember
what they did to you.

25:35.444 --> 25:39.480
Hold on to that anger,
then go do what I need.

25:41.684 --> 25:43.250
All right, yeah.

25:44.570 --> 25:46.270
What was that?

25:48.100 --> 25:49.700
Yes, sir.

25:52.528 --> 25:53.861
Screw up...

25:54.839 --> 25:57.998
and I'll rip that spinal implant
out and shove it down your throat.

26:13.415 --> 26:15.048
Would you buy drugs from him?

26:19.989 --> 26:21.455
No.

26:22.209 --> 26:23.775
Me either,

26:25.161 --> 26:27.794
which means you can't
put him on the corner,

26:29.300 --> 26:31.698
which means you one man down.

26:33.502 --> 26:37.538
No disrespect, Lala, but he
should've kept his damn mouth shut.

26:43.846 --> 26:45.279
Okay.

26:47.816 --> 26:49.769
Maybe moving him to a less lucrative

26:49.772 --> 26:51.940
spot would have delivered the message.

26:59.028 --> 27:00.862
I get to beat people up.

27:03.185 --> 27:04.901
But when you do it,

27:06.702 --> 27:08.628
it destroys the morale.

27:11.607 --> 27:13.740
And it endangers loyalty.

27:14.610 --> 27:16.376
And that's...

27:16.925 --> 27:18.045
What?

27:18.047 --> 27:20.514
The Devil deals the cards.

27:24.910 --> 27:26.977
Endangers loyal what?

27:33.900 --> 27:35.633
Hey, Lala, you all right?

27:40.436 --> 27:42.436
Endangers loyalty, how?

27:52.982 --> 27:56.083
Peter, it's Thomas. I've
got what we discussed.

27:56.885 --> 27:59.019
Use the door this time.

27:59.021 --> 28:02.456
And when we're done, I'd
like to never see you again.

28:20.982 --> 28:25.052
Does the force of the closure indicate
that you're ready for your exam?

28:25.055 --> 28:27.454
No. That's just enough precalc.

28:27.456 --> 28:31.841
I swear, I hate to sound like
a cliche, but it's useless.

28:31.844 --> 28:34.778
So tell me about this
procedure you're developing.

28:37.265 --> 28:40.291
Did you tell your father
I was tryin' to fix you?

28:40.294 --> 28:43.436
- Isn't that what you're tryin' to do?
- No.

28:43.438 --> 28:45.772
Because there's nothing wrong with you.

28:45.774 --> 28:50.176
I just wanna understand what's
happening and give you the options.

28:50.179 --> 28:53.079
The procedures and the treatments
I've been talking about,

28:53.081 --> 28:55.181
they're all theory and hypothesis.

28:55.183 --> 28:58.096
There's no telling how long it
would take to develop them or

28:58.099 --> 28:59.855
even if they'd be safe.

29:00.902 --> 29:02.568
Mom, you can stop frosting.

29:03.581 --> 29:05.225
Could you please just cut me a piece?

29:05.227 --> 29:07.527
'Cause all my options are horrible.

29:07.530 --> 29:10.030
Okay.

29:10.714 --> 29:13.233
So, our conversation
earlier got me thinking.

29:13.235 --> 29:15.206
These pods need a lot of electricity.

29:15.209 --> 29:17.937
And if this isn't the first time
the ASA's tried to move them,

29:17.939 --> 29:20.540
we might be able to track the
electrical spikes in the facilities

29:20.542 --> 29:21.975
where they'd been and then left,

29:21.977 --> 29:23.810
which means we might
be able to find them.

29:26.406 --> 29:27.772
So it turns out, Marcus Roberts,

29:27.775 --> 29:30.761
who graduated at Garfield a
year ahead of me, works at FGE.

29:30.764 --> 29:33.752
I called him up, said I
was into energy efficiency

29:33.755 --> 29:35.822
and new economic development, and he...

29:35.824 --> 29:37.323
Didn't he have a crush on you?

29:38.393 --> 29:41.542
Dad! I did not flirt with him, okay?

29:41.545 --> 29:43.972
Look, he's just interested in
helping the community, guys.

29:43.975 --> 29:45.008
Okay.

29:45.011 --> 29:47.700
Anyway. So he found
these up and down spikes

29:47.703 --> 29:51.401
at various locations until
about three years ago.

29:51.404 --> 29:53.973
And then, nothing.

29:53.975 --> 29:57.226
That coincides with the development
of high-output mobile solar power.

29:57.229 --> 30:00.213
Could be they realized that being
on the grid was a vulnerability.

30:00.215 --> 30:03.149
I got a call from Hidalgo. He
must know Proctor's location.

30:03.151 --> 30:06.753
I'll show you guys how to search the
satellites for rooftop solar panels.

30:07.889 --> 30:09.448
And then I'll go find

30:09.451 --> 30:10.409
that guy.

30:10.420 --> 30:11.628
Wait, uh, turn that up.

30:11.631 --> 30:14.059
All units in the vicinity,
the facility is under assault.

30:14.062 --> 30:17.197
This is a tactical operation,
and SWAT is en route.

30:17.206 --> 30:21.241
Do not attempt to enter the
building. Repeat, do not.

30:22.789 --> 30:24.088
Exams are starting.

30:24.091 --> 30:26.101
Everyone will be in their
classrooms. I need to go.

30:26.104 --> 30:28.975
Black Lightning hasn't been totally
cleared in Lady Eve's murder yet.

30:28.978 --> 30:30.378
You'll still be a police target.

30:30.381 --> 30:33.095
But I'm not gonna lay in the shadows
and watch my students get attacked.

30:33.097 --> 30:34.981
Anissa, if you want...

30:34.983 --> 30:37.751
Gambi, tap into the cameras,
see what you can find.

31:03.410 --> 31:06.263
I never could stand your ass.

31:06.266 --> 31:08.156
What're you doing, Khalil?

31:34.771 --> 31:36.274
Hey, hey, stop! Stop.

31:36.276 --> 31:39.005
- I'm just getting started.
- This is not you.

31:39.008 --> 31:40.812
This is not the Khalil
I was friends with.

31:40.814 --> 31:41.846
Please, you don't have to do this.

31:41.848 --> 31:43.104
Jennifer, this is me.

31:43.107 --> 31:45.650
And, yes, I do have to do this.

31:46.279 --> 31:49.520
Now, look. I won't hurt her,
but you need to get out of here.

31:50.490 --> 31:52.757
Girl, did I stutter? I said go!

31:55.595 --> 31:57.674
Come on, slow down. Let's go, let's go.

31:57.677 --> 31:59.979
Exit the classroom. Slow down.

31:59.982 --> 32:02.633
Come on. I know, I know. Just go.

32:06.239 --> 32:07.705
Get these kids outta here.

32:09.843 --> 32:11.275
- Hey.
- That way.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.844
- Wait.
- Go.

32:14.481 --> 32:17.081
I'm blind inside the school,
but I'm working on it.

32:17.083 --> 32:19.383
And SWAT's about five
minutes from coming in.

32:19.385 --> 32:20.752
We should split up.

32:21.254 --> 32:23.187
Come on. Go, go, go.

32:23.189 --> 32:25.289
Slow down.

32:40.607 --> 32:41.906
Go.

33:40.934 --> 33:42.233
Oh, yeah.

33:43.702 --> 33:47.610
I thought you'd run off after
I kicked your ass at the club.

33:47.613 --> 33:51.475
It's gonna take more than a clown
in a shiny suit to take me down.

33:59.919 --> 34:01.394
Is that all you've got?

34:02.255 --> 34:04.255
You think I'd come unprepared?

34:04.257 --> 34:06.224
I've waited a long time for this.

34:06.226 --> 34:09.060
Looks like he's wearing
some kind of undersuit.

34:09.062 --> 34:13.418
You gonna have to fight me like
a man. Not a little lightning bug.

34:13.420 --> 34:14.820
Don't do it, Jeff.

34:14.822 --> 34:17.567
Tactically, hand-to-hand
combat makes no sense.

35:24.237 --> 35:27.137
Anissa, your dad needs your
help. Get over there, quick.

35:56.502 --> 35:57.601
Like I said,

35:57.603 --> 35:59.380
I didn't come unprepared.

35:59.383 --> 36:00.816
Zap the kid hard.

36:00.819 --> 36:03.352
It'll short-out his implant.
He'll be paralyzed again.

36:03.355 --> 36:06.676
Look, Jeff, I know how you feel about
the kid, but this is not the time.

36:06.681 --> 36:09.348
SWAT's about to come in, the
bullets are gonna start flying.

36:16.622 --> 36:19.256
What was that?

36:20.226 --> 36:21.726
What was that?

36:38.144 --> 36:41.045
Now! Move. Now!

36:45.887 --> 36:47.752
I'm not looking to go backwards.

36:47.754 --> 36:49.520
I pray that's true.

36:50.890 --> 36:53.624
'Cause I don't ever wanna
see you like that again, ever.

36:53.626 --> 36:55.292
What happened, Dad?

36:59.622 --> 37:01.355
Jeff?

37:04.337 --> 37:06.769
We took this super-negro out.

37:09.776 --> 37:11.243
Oh, no!

37:12.145 --> 37:14.078
He's dead, you idiot.

37:14.080 --> 37:16.714
What about "alive"
didn't you understand?

37:20.953 --> 37:23.187
Not so hot, now, huh?

37:25.658 --> 37:29.460
At least I can finally
see who this clown is.

37:47.580 --> 37:49.013
Go, go.

37:51.488 --> 37:53.784
All right, come on,
Dad. We gotta get up.

37:53.786 --> 37:55.052
Dad.

37:57.256 --> 38:03.884
Dad. Dad, wake up.

38:03.887 --> 38:05.629
No, Dad, wake up!

38:07.200 --> 38:08.699
Dad, wake up.

38:11.121 --> 38:14.032
Do something! Dad, wake up!

38:17.477 --> 38:19.343
What was that?

38:19.345 --> 38:20.544
It was Jennifer.

38:20.546 --> 38:23.087
Whatever Jennifer did,
tell her to do it again.

38:23.090 --> 38:24.248
Hard.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.716
Come on, Jen. One more time.

38:25.718 --> 38:27.718
Shock him. Shock him one more time.

38:38.164 --> 38:39.997
Oh, thank God.

38:41.433 --> 38:43.967
You did it, Jen. He's back.

38:56.449 --> 38:58.769
Anissa, take your dad through
there to the back room.

38:58.772 --> 39:02.307
Lynn, let me have your
phone. Jen, you too.

39:02.310 --> 39:03.948
- Watch out, watch out.
- Listen.

39:03.951 --> 39:05.207
There's a hammer under the sink in there

39:05.209 --> 39:06.723
I wa you to use it to smash these phones

39:06.725 --> 39:08.314
and then run them under the water. Okay?

39:08.316 --> 39:10.264
The ASA can track us
through those phones.

39:10.267 --> 39:11.347
Put him down gently.

39:12.264 --> 39:13.730
Where are the medical supplies?

39:13.732 --> 39:15.866
- They're in the closet.
- Okay.

39:15.868 --> 39:20.370
I'm gonna cloak this place against all
surveillance, satellite, you name it.

39:21.347 --> 39:23.941
We're safe inside the house for
now. We just need to stay inside.

39:23.943 --> 39:26.677
- All right, phones are toast.
- All right, cool. What's next?

39:26.679 --> 39:29.012
Just help me get your father
out of this suit, right now.

39:34.887 --> 39:36.386
Dead?

39:36.388 --> 39:39.156
Some of the students heard
someone say he was dead.

39:39.158 --> 39:42.359
Another student claimed to
have seen the other meta,

39:42.361 --> 39:45.295
Thunder, carrying his
body from the school.

39:53.572 --> 39:56.039
Find Black Lightning's body.

39:56.041 --> 39:58.842
Bring me Thunder, dead or alive.

39:58.844 --> 40:04.114
I don't care if you have to
burn down Freeland to do it.

40:05.384 --> 40:07.518
This experiment...

40:10.523 --> 40:13.657
cannot fail!

40:42.321 --> 40:43.954
Latavious.

40:45.565 --> 40:47.948
Now do you believe in the Resurrection?

40:49.895 --> 40:51.862
I will blow your head off, you mother...

40:51.864 --> 40:54.765
The Devil deals the cards.

40:57.691 --> 40:59.712
Sit your ass down.

41:05.344 --> 41:06.527
I really hate loose ends,

41:06.530 --> 41:08.855
so I wanna thank you for taking
care of the weapons maker.

41:10.950 --> 41:12.449
You're welcome.

41:16.422 --> 41:18.255
We killed Lady Eve to get a seat.

41:20.159 --> 41:24.376
Now we just have to take care of Proctor
and we'll own the whole damn table.

41:26.310 --> 41:28.577
So, Latavious...

41:29.731 --> 41:31.464
shall we begin?

41:33.377 --> 41:34.977
Yes, sir.
