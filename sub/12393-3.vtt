WEBVTT

00:09.540 --> 00:14.534
- SHAWN, WHY IS THERE
A GIANT HOLE IN MY FRONT YARD?

00:14.580 --> 00:16.571
- IT'S SIMPLE, DAD.

00:16.610 --> 00:18.202
DON'T GET UPSET.

00:18.250 --> 00:19.615
THE HOLE WAS MY GRAVE.

00:19.650 --> 00:20.776
- WHAT?

00:20.820 --> 00:23.584
- GUS MADE ME DIG
MY OWN GRAVE,

00:23.620 --> 00:25.747
THEN SHOT ME
AND STOLE MY BOOTS.

00:25.790 --> 00:26.859
ONLY HE DIDN'T BURY ME
FAR ENOUGH,

00:26.890 --> 00:28.255
AND THE BUZZARDS ATE
MY ENTRAILS.

00:28.290 --> 00:34.126
- OH. SO YOU--YOU WERE PLAYING
COWBOYS AND INDIANS, HUH?

00:34.160 --> 00:36.663
- JUST COWBOYS.
PLAYING INDIANS IS OFFENSIVE.

00:36.700 --> 00:38.895
- AND THEN THE BUZZARDS ATE
YOUR ENTRAILS.

00:38.930 --> 00:40.136
THAT'S AWFUL.

00:40.170 --> 00:42.764
- YEAH. IT WAS A TRAGIC END
TO OUR ADVENTURE.

00:42.810 --> 00:44.334
BUT IT'S THE REALISM
THAT MAKES IT FUN.

00:44.370 --> 00:46.577
IF IT HELPS,
GUS ENDED UP GETTING HUNG

00:46.610 --> 00:48.805
BY A ONE-EYED, CROOKED SHERIFF.

00:50.780 --> 00:53.419
- WELL, DID THE BUZZARDS EAT
HIS ENTRAILS TOO?

00:53.450 --> 00:54.542
- OF COURSE THEY DID.

00:54.580 --> 00:56.741
- MM. HEY, SHAWN,
I GOT A GAME FOR YA.

00:56.790 --> 00:58.815
IT'S CALLED "GET YOUR BUTI'
IN MY YARD

00:58.850 --> 01:00.579
AND FILL IN THAT HOLE NOW."

01:00.620 --> 01:03.828
IT'S THE REALISM
THAT MAKES THAT FUN TOO.

01:12.170 --> 01:15.059
- HE'S GOING TO KILL US.
- WHAT?

01:15.100 --> 01:17.432
- HE HASN'T SAID A WORD THE
WHOLE TIME HE'S BEEN DRIVING.

01:17.470 --> 01:19.609
FACE IT, SHAWN.
HE'S FINALLY SNAPPED.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.369
- HE ASKED US FOR A FAVOR.
THAT'S ALL.

01:21.410 --> 01:23.549
WE CAN LEAVE ANYTIME WE WANT.

01:23.580 --> 01:26.708
CASE IN POINT.
[tries to open the door]

01:26.750 --> 01:30.948
[jostling handles]

01:30.990 --> 01:32.389
- THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

01:32.420 --> 01:34.183
YOU AND ALL YOUR PRACTICAL JOKES
YOU PLAY ON HIM.

01:34.220 --> 01:35.756
- THOSE WERE
TEAM-BUILDING EXERCISES

01:35.790 --> 01:36.779
TO BUILD CAMARADERIE.

01:36.830 --> 01:37.979
- HOW DO YOU BUILD CAMARADERIE

01:38.030 --> 01:39.258
BY CHANGING
SOMEONE'S BANK ACCOUNT NUMBERS?

01:39.300 --> 01:42.394
[jostling door handles]

01:42.430 --> 01:43.795
- WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON
BACK THERE?

01:43.830 --> 01:45.695
- LOOK, LASSIE, I KNOW I'VE BEEN

01:45.730 --> 01:47.038
A TAD ANNOYING IN THE PAST.

01:47.070 --> 01:49.368
BUT SHOOTING GUS AND DISPOSING
HIS BODY IN THE AQUIFER

01:49.410 --> 01:50.638
IS NOT THE ANSWER.
[Gus hIts Shawn]

01:50.670 --> 01:52.206
OW.
- DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.673
I'M NOT GONNA SHOOT ANYONE.

01:54.880 --> 01:55.869
- HE DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING

01:55.910 --> 01:57.002
ABOUT KNIFING ANYBODY.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.699
- DO YOU REALLY NEED
THAT CLARIFICATION?

01:58.750 --> 02:00.047
- IT WOULD BE NICE, YES.

02:01.780 --> 02:03.042
- SO WHAT'S
WITH ALL THE SECRECY,

02:03.090 --> 02:06.116
YOU HANDSOME, PASTY DEVIL?

02:06.160 --> 02:07.752
- WHAT WE'RE DOING ISN'T EXACTLY

02:07.790 --> 02:09.758
OFFICIAL SANTA BARBARA POLICE
BUSINESS,

02:09.790 --> 02:11.223
AND IT ISN'T EXACTLY
IN MY JURISDICTION.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.455
WE'RE GOING TO A SMALL TOWN
A FEW MILES UP NORTH.

02:13.500 --> 02:15.252
THE SHERIFF'S AN OLD FRIEND
OF MINE.

02:15.300 --> 02:17.564
SOME UNEXPLAINED THINGS
HAVE BEEN HAPPENING AT NIGHT.

02:17.600 --> 02:22.606
YOU TWO HAVE A PROPENSITY FOR
FINDING SOMETHING FROM NOTHING,

02:22.640 --> 02:23.800
AND I NEED THAT GIFI'.

02:40.090 --> 02:42.479
- WHERE'S THE TOWN?

02:42.530 --> 02:45.090
- THIS IS THE BACK.

02:45.130 --> 02:46.256
- THE BACK?

02:49.500 --> 02:53.391
- WOW. JUST HOW OLD
IS OLD SONORA?

02:53.440 --> 02:55.237
- I WILL ASK YOU TO STIFLE
YOUR URGE

02:55.270 --> 02:57.204
TO MAKE FUN OF EVERYTHING
THAT IS DECENT.

02:57.240 --> 02:59.936
SHERIFF HANK IS A GOOD MAN WHO
DESERVES NOT ONLY YOUR RESPECT,

02:59.980 --> 03:01.504
BUT YOUR ADMIRATION.

03:03.580 --> 03:04.706
- OKAY.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.142
- SHERIFF!

03:11.650 --> 03:13.356
- WELL, LOOK AT YOU.

03:13.390 --> 03:16.848
AIN'T YOU A SIGHT
FOR SORE EYES?

03:16.890 --> 03:17.857
THANKS FOR COMING.

03:17.890 --> 03:19.221
- HOW YOU DOING, SHERIFF?

03:19.260 --> 03:22.559
SO THESE ARE THE MEN
I WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT.

03:22.600 --> 03:24.522
THIS IS BURTON GUSTER
AND SHAWN SPENCER.

03:24.570 --> 03:29.234
- WELL, PARDON ME, BUT WE HAD A
MESS OF TROUBLE HERE LAST NIGHT.

03:29.270 --> 03:31.033
SHERIFF HANK MENDEL.

03:31.070 --> 03:33.504
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
WELCOME TO OLD SONORA.

03:33.540 --> 03:35.007
- THANK YOU, SHERIFF.

03:35.040 --> 03:38.271
I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD
ABOUT WHAT I DO, HOW COOL IT IS.

03:38.310 --> 03:40.449
YOU'VE NOW SEEN MY HAIR, WHICH
MEANS YOU'RE DOUBLY IMPRESSED,

03:40.480 --> 03:42.983
BUT LET'S NOT GET WRAPPED UP
IN GUSHY COMPLIMENTS.

03:43.020 --> 03:45.113
I GET A LITTLE SELF-CONSCIOUS.

03:45.150 --> 03:46.981
- HELL, I WASN'T GONNA
EVEN CALL YOU OUT HERE,

03:47.020 --> 03:48.681
BUT BINKY INSISTED.

03:48.720 --> 03:50.028
- BINKY?

03:50.060 --> 03:52.051
- OH, YOU DON'T CALL HIM BINKY?

03:52.090 --> 03:53.853
- WE DO NOW.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.629
- SHERIFF HANK, WHY DON'T YOU
TELL THE BOYS

03:55.660 --> 03:56.797
WHAT THE PROBLEM'S BEEN HERE?

03:56.830 --> 04:01.290
- WELL, IT STARTED OUT
AS SIMPLE VANDALISM.

04:01.340 --> 04:03.900
SOMEBODY'S BEEN STEALING
OUR WOOD FROM SIDEWALKS,

04:03.940 --> 04:07.501
BUILDINGS, FENCE POSTS.

04:07.540 --> 04:08.507
- WOOD THIEVES.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.371
MY FIRST INSTINCT IS BEAVERS,

04:10.410 --> 04:13.117
BUT I'M NOT WILLING TO RULE OUT
THOSE PESKY KEEBLER ELVES.

04:13.150 --> 04:14.242
WHAT ELSE DO YOU GOT?

04:14.280 --> 04:19.718
- WELL, OUR WATER'S BEEN
POISONED, AND CHECK THIS OUT.

04:19.760 --> 04:23.252
THERE'S BEEN A STENCH IN THE AIR
THAT WASN'T THERE BEFORE.

04:23.290 --> 04:25.588
- THAT'S FUNNY.
I DON'T SMELL ANYTHING.

04:25.630 --> 04:27.359
- OH, GOSH. CAT URINE.

04:27.400 --> 04:28.958
- AH. DON'T MIND HIM.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.467
CAT PEE IS GUS'S KRYPTONITE.

04:30.500 --> 04:32.263
AS A CHILD,
HE WAS LOCKED IN A CLOSET

04:32.300 --> 04:35.667
WITH THE FAMILY'S
INCONTINENT TABBY, MR. B.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.837
IT'S A VERY LONG STORY.

04:36.870 --> 04:38.406
- NO, IT'S NOT.
THAT'S THE STORY.

04:38.440 --> 04:39.805
- JUST BREATHE
THROUGH YOUR MOUTH, ALL RIGHT?

04:39.840 --> 04:42.274
- SINCE THEN, THINGS HAVE GOTI'EN
MORE AGGRESSIVE.

04:42.310 --> 04:47.373
STUFF HAS BEEN STOLEN,
MISPLACED, DESTROYED.

04:47.420 --> 04:50.082
AND FOLKS ARE STARTING
TO GET NERVOUS.

04:50.120 --> 04:51.940
AND IT'S MY JOB
TO PROTECT THEM.

04:51.990 --> 04:53.014
HEY!

04:53.060 --> 04:55.255
[bird caws]

04:55.290 --> 04:58.259
DROP YOUR WEAPON
AND COME PEACEABLY.

04:58.290 --> 05:02.499
- WELL, SHERIFF, I AIN'T EXACTLY
A PEACEFUL MAN.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.164
[gunshot]

05:13.780 --> 05:14.974
- HE SHOT THAT GUY.

05:15.010 --> 05:17.001
- I KNOW.
ISN'T IT GREAT?

05:17.050 --> 05:20.577
[applause]

05:27.090 --> 05:31.322
- THIS IS NOT A REAL TOWN.

05:31.360 --> 05:32.827
- IT'S A TOURIST TRAP.

05:34.360 --> 05:37.329
[The Friendly Indians'
I Know You Know]

05:37.370 --> 05:41.636
*

05:41.670 --> 05:44.537
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES
THERE'S A LOT OF OBSCURITY *

05:44.570 --> 05:48.108
* I'M NOT INCLINED
TO RESIGN TO MATURITY *

05:48.140 --> 05:51.678
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG *

05:51.710 --> 05:55.339
* BUT WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

05:55.380 --> 05:56.688
*

05:56.720 --> 06:00.178
* YOU'D RATHER RUN
WHEN YOU CAN CRAWL *

THAT I'M NOT TELLING THE TRUTH *

06:05.960 --> 06:09.327
* I KNOW YOU KNOW
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE ANY PROOF *

06:09.360 --> 06:10.429

06:26.820 --> 06:29.448
- LISTEN CLOSELY 'CAUSE
I'M GONNA ONLY SAY THIS ONCE.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.811
OLD SONORA IS
AN OLD HISTORIC MINING TOWN

06:31.850 --> 06:33.249
WITH BUILDINGS RECREATED

06:33.290 --> 06:35.212
TO CAPTURE THE SPIRIT
OF THE OLD WEST.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.956
I SPENT EVERY WEEKEND OF MY
CHILDHOOD IN THIS BELOVED PLACE,

06:37.990 --> 06:40.356
AND I AM NOT ABOUT TO LET
SOME FACELESS COWARD

06:40.400 --> 06:42.823
WHO ONLY COMES OUT AT NIGHT
TEAR IT DOWN.

06:42.870 --> 06:44.223
I NEED YOU TWO TO FIND OUT

06:44.270 --> 06:45.862
WHO'S DOING THIS
AND FAST.

06:49.240 --> 06:51.959
- ALL RIGHT.
COUNT ON US.

06:52.010 --> 06:53.568
- I KNEW I COULD.

06:55.010 --> 06:56.773
HERE'S YOUR BEDROLLS.
GOOD LUCK.

06:56.810 --> 06:58.402
- WE'RE SLEEPING HERE?

- WELL, IT HAPPENS AT NIGHT,

07:00.320 --> 07:01.446
SO YOU HAVE TO STAY HERE
AT NIGHT.

07:01.480 --> 07:02.515
- WHAT ABOUT YOU?

07:02.550 --> 07:03.949
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

07:03.990 --> 07:05.184
I CAN'T BE CAUGHT
INVESTIGATING HERE.

07:05.220 --> 07:07.609
DO YOU KNOW HOW FAR OUT
OF MY JURISDICTION WE ARE?

07:09.290 --> 07:10.257
SEE YOU LATER, HANK.

07:10.290 --> 07:11.723
- THANKS FOR YOUR HELP, BINKY.

07:11.760 --> 07:12.920
- YOU GOT IT.

07:12.960 --> 07:14.291
I'LL CHECK BACK WITH YOU
IN THE MORNING.

07:14.330 --> 07:17.128
- WAIT, SO YOU EXPECT ME
TO STAY HERE THE ENTIRE NIGHT?

07:17.170 --> 07:19.058
- BINKY!
COME BACK.

- HMM.

PULL THAT.
- STOP.

07:37.890 --> 07:39.710
- TELL ME, HANK...
[clears throat]

07:39.760 --> 07:44.288
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
THIS VANDAL?

07:44.330 --> 07:45.820
- I'VE FELT 'EM.

07:45.860 --> 07:48.658
- WAS THAT
IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY?

07:48.700 --> 07:50.190
- I FELT THEIR PRESENCE.

07:50.230 --> 07:52.767
- I SEE.

07:52.800 --> 07:55.064
CAN YOU THINK
OF ANY OTHER EXPLANATION

07:55.100 --> 07:58.069
FOR WHY THIS TOWN
IS FALLING APART?

07:58.110 --> 08:00.101
- ARE YOU TALKING
ABOUT THE GHOST RIDER?

08:00.140 --> 08:03.200
- UH...

08:03.250 --> 08:04.205
NO.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.275
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN
BY GHOST RIDER?

08:06.310 --> 08:08.642
- ACCORDING TO THE LEGENDS,
HE WAS A HORSE THIEF

08:08.680 --> 08:10.614
THAT MET HIS FATE
AT THE END OF A ROPE.

08:10.650 --> 08:13.813
THEY SAY HIS SPIRIT
STILL HAUNTS THESE PARTS.

08:13.860 --> 08:15.487
NOW I, MYSELF, DON'T CATER

08:15.520 --> 08:19.229
TO THIS TALE, NO MATTER HOW MANY
PEOPLE OUT HERE SEE HIM.

08:19.260 --> 08:20.659
[fly buzzes]
- NOPE.

08:20.700 --> 08:21.928
I'M OUT OF HERE.
I'M CALLING A CAB.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.564
- WELL, THOSE THINGS
DON'T WORK OUT HERE.

08:23.600 --> 08:27.832
WE GOT NO TVS, NO RADIO,
NO REFRIGERATORS.

08:27.870 --> 08:31.101
- SOUNDS LIKE PRISON, EXCEPT
THEY HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS.

08:31.140 --> 08:32.630
- WOULD YOU STOP IT?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.636
- HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN BINKY,
HANK?

08:34.680 --> 08:36.875
- OH, 30 YEARS OR SO.

08:36.910 --> 08:38.502
USED TO COME HERE
EVERY WEEKEND.

08:38.550 --> 08:40.677
HIS PAPA
WASN'T AROUND THAT MUCH,

08:40.720 --> 08:41.914
AND HIS MAMA WORKED DAYS,

08:41.950 --> 08:43.315
SO SHE DROPPED HIM OFF
SATURDAYS.

08:43.350 --> 08:46.012
I GUESS HE NEEDED SOMEBODY.
I SUPPOSE I DID TOO.

08:46.050 --> 08:47.915
WE'VE BEEN CLOSE EVER SINCE.

08:47.960 --> 08:53.648
IN FACT, HE'S ABOUT THE
NEAREST THING I GOT TO FAMILY.

08:53.700 --> 08:57.818
- WOW. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
ABOUT LASSIE'S PAPA.

08:57.870 --> 08:59.519
HIS PAPA WASN'T AROUND MUCH,
GUS.

08:59.570 --> 09:01.390
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

[horse whinnies]

09:03.810 --> 09:05.209
- YOU HEAR THAT?

09:05.240 --> 09:07.629
SOMETHING'S SPOOKING THE HORSES.
[horses whinny]

09:11.350 --> 09:14.069
- WHAT THE HELL ARE WE DOING?
- I DON'T KNOW, GUS.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.913
I THINK I'M STARTING TO GET
WHY LASSIE LOVES

09:16.950 --> 09:18.542
THIS PLACE SO MUCH.

09:18.590 --> 09:19.852
IT REPRESENTS A SIMPLER TIME

09:19.890 --> 09:21.551
WHEN PEOPLE WEREN'T
SO PREOCCUPIED

09:21.590 --> 09:23.148
WITH THE DISTRACT IONS
OF MODERN LIFE.

09:23.190 --> 09:24.726
- LIKE LIVING PAST AGE 40.

09:24.760 --> 09:26.694
- ALL RIGHT,
YOU BE YOUR CYNICAL SELF.

09:26.730 --> 09:28.095
I'M JUST SAYING.

09:28.130 --> 09:29.768
TECHNOLOGY IS WAY OVERRATED.

09:29.800 --> 09:31.529
- THAT'S INTERESTING.

09:31.570 --> 09:32.867
JUST YESTERDAY
YOU TOLD ME YOU INTEND

09:32.900 --> 09:34.060
ON HAVING
YOUR WEDDING IN SPACE.

09:34.100 --> 09:36.364
- AND THAT HASN'T CHANGED.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.709
I'M JUST SAYING I THINK THE PAST
IS ALSO WORTH PRESERVING.

09:38.740 --> 09:41.402
- YEAH, WELL, YOUR PEOPLE HAVE
A MUCH MORE AFFECT IONATE MEMORY

09:41.440 --> 09:43.305
OF THIS PERIOD OF HISTORY
THAN MY PEOPLE DO.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.749
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:44.780 --> 09:47.943
WE SAW POSSE TOGETHER
IN THEATERS.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.948
[wind gusts]

09:53.760 --> 09:55.387
- I WANT TO GO HOME.

09:55.420 --> 09:56.853
- YEAH, THAT'S FAIR.

09:56.890 --> 09:59.757
HANK!
[distant howling]

09:59.800 --> 10:02.394
HANK!

10:02.430 --> 10:04.022
- HERE'S HOW IT'S GONNA GO.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.493
WE'RE GONNA TELL HANK
HIS TOWN'S OLD AND DECREPIT,

10:06.530 --> 10:08.998
AND HE SHOULD BE GLAD IT
DIDN'T FALL DOWN TEN YEARS AGO.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.099
THERE IS NO SABOTEUR,
NO VAN DAL,

10:11.140 --> 10:12.334
NO BAD GUY.

10:12.370 --> 10:14.235
AT THE WORST,
HE HAS A TERRIBLE CAT PROBLEM.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.429
[trips over something]

10:15.480 --> 10:17.641
- GUS.
- WATCH YOUR FEET!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.568
- WATCH MY FEET?
I'M LEADING THE WAY.

10:19.610 --> 10:21.248
- YOUR STRIDE IS TOO LONG,
SHAWN.

10:21.280 --> 10:23.612
- IT'S YOUR RIDICULOUS GAIT.
THAT'S THE PROBLEM.

10:23.650 --> 10:24.742
- NO, YOUR SHOES ARE TOO LARGE.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.008
- [sighs]

10:27.060 --> 10:29.051
- GUS.
- WHAT?

10:29.090 --> 10:32.696
- DON'T PANIC.

10:37.430 --> 10:40.593
[grunt]

10:40.640 --> 10:43.302
HANK! HANK!

10:45.310 --> 10:46.971
THERE'S NO HANK.
- NO HORSES.

10:47.010 --> 10:49.433
- [sniffs]

10:54.320 --> 10:56.174
[galloping]
- WHAT IS THAT SOUND?

10:56.220 --> 10:57.619
[galloping approaches]

10:57.650 --> 10:58.685
[whinnying]

10:58.720 --> 11:00.210
- LOOK OUT!

11:00.260 --> 11:02.785
- AHH!

11:02.830 --> 11:06.049
[whinnying]

11:10.430 --> 11:12.421
- [coughs]

11:16.370 --> 11:17.359
HANK!

11:21.510 --> 11:23.239
OH, NO.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.241
- EASY.
- BRING HIM IN. BRING HIM IN.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.747
- I DON'T BELIEVE THIS.

11:29.790 --> 11:31.348
I SENT YOU TWO OUT THERE TO FIND
OUT WHAT THE HECK'S GOING ON,

11:31.390 --> 11:33.278
AND YOU GET SHERIFF HANK
RUN OVER BY HORSES?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.719
- LOOK, LASSIE, FIRST OF ALL,
I DON'T EVEN KNOW

11:34.760 --> 11:35.988
HOW TO GET SOMEONE RUN OVER.

11:36.020 --> 11:37.282
AND AS LONG
AS WE'RE ASSIGNING BLAME,

11:37.330 --> 11:38.479
THE HORSES SHOULDN'T GET OFF
SCOT-FREE.

11:38.530 --> 11:39.895
- WE FEEL TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS,

11:39.930 --> 11:42.228
EVEN THOUGH IT WAS HANK
WHO LEFI' US THERE ALL ALONE.

11:42.260 --> 11:43.591
- YOU'RE LUCKY
HE DIDN'T GET KILLED.

11:43.630 --> 11:45.598
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.564
I DON'T WANT HIM BLEEDING
ALL OVER MY COUCH.

11:47.600 --> 11:49.067
THERE YOU GO.
- OKAY.

11:49.100 --> 11:50.306
- EASY.

11:50.340 --> 11:51.568
[grunting]
- THAT'S BETTER.

11:51.610 --> 11:52.929
- HE SHOULD REALLY BE
IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

11:52.980 --> 11:55.631
- NO HOSPITALS.
- HE DOESN'T BELIEVE IN 'EM.

11:55.680 --> 11:58.046
SAYS THE ONLY WAY HE'S EVER
GONNA GO IN ONE IS FEET-FIRST.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.843
- COME HERE.
LET'S PUT IT UP HERE.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.643
LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- OH!

12:01.680 --> 12:03.238
- OOH, OOH, GUYS,
THIS IS DEEP.

12:03.290 --> 12:04.643
THIS MAN HAS GOT
TO SEE A DOCTOR.

12:04.690 --> 12:05.782
I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANYTHING

12:05.820 --> 12:07.378
TO NUMB THE PAIN.
- THAT'S OKAY.

12:07.420 --> 12:09.479
I DON'T BELIEVE
IN ANESTHETICS.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.556
GUS, JUST BITE DOWN
ON MY BIG TOE.

12:11.590 --> 12:13.899
IT'LL MAKE ME FORGET
ABOUT THE PAIN IN MY LEG.

12:13.930 --> 12:15.295
- I'M NOT BITING DOWN
ON YOUR TOE.

12:15.330 --> 12:17.423
- DAMN IT, GUS, WHEN A MAN
ASKS YOU TO BITE HIS TOE,

12:17.470 --> 12:19.097
YOU BITE HIS TOE.
- YOU DO IT.

12:19.130 --> 12:22.429
- DRINK THIS.
- OH, MUCH OBLIGED.

12:22.470 --> 12:25.030
- UH, HANK, I JUST WANT TO SAY
ON BEHALF OF GUS AND I,

12:25.070 --> 12:28.039
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR SAVING OUR LIVES.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.640
- I'M THE SHERIFF.
THAT'S WHAT I'M PAID FOR.

12:30.680 --> 12:32.307
- WELL, TECHNICALLY,
YOU'RE NOT A REAL SHERIFF,

12:32.350 --> 12:33.908
AND WHEN YOU SAY "THEY,"
YOU ACTUALLY MEAN YOU,

12:33.950 --> 12:36.111
BEING THAT YOU OWN THE TOWN,
WHICH ISN'T REALLY A TOWN.

12:36.150 --> 12:38.084
- WHY?
- JUST HURRY UP

12:38.120 --> 12:39.109
AND DO THIS, WILL YA?

12:39.150 --> 12:40.856
I GOT TO OPEN THEM GATES
BY 9:00.

12:40.890 --> 12:44.348
- PAL, YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE
FOR QUITE A WHILE

12:44.390 --> 12:46.153
EVEN IF I DO GET THIS SEWN UP.

12:46.190 --> 12:49.057
- OLD SONORA HASN'T CLOSED
IN 45 YEARS

12:49.100 --> 12:50.522
AND IT AIN'T
GONNA CLOSE TODAY.

12:50.570 --> 12:51.923
- SPENCER, COME HERE.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.106
LOOK, WITH EVERYTHING
THAT'S BEEN GOING ON OUT THERE

12:57.140 --> 12:58.459
AND NOW FINDING THIS DEAD BODY,

12:58.510 --> 12:59.829
THE COUNTY WANTS TO SHUT DOWN
OLD SONORA,

12:59.880 --> 13:01.006
WHICH MEANS NOT ONLY
WILL A PLACE

13:01.040 --> 13:02.473
THAT TEACHES CHILDREN
IMPORTANT LESSONS

13:02.510 --> 13:04.102
FROM A SIMPLER TIME
BE LOST FOREVER,

13:04.150 --> 13:05.674
BUT SHERIFF HANK
WILL BE LEFI' DESTITUTE,

13:05.710 --> 13:07.109
AND I WILL NOT LET THAT HAPPEN.

13:08.620 --> 13:09.985
- DON'T WORRY, BINKY.

13:10.020 --> 13:11.385
I ALREADY HAVE A PLAN.

13:30.870 --> 13:33.771
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY,
TAKE A GOOD LOOK.

13:33.810 --> 13:35.129
KEEP LOOKING.

13:35.180 --> 13:38.104
DRINK IT IN.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.072
LIKE A...

13:40.120 --> 13:42.111
BOTI'LE OF LAUDANUM.

13:42.150 --> 13:44.186
- THERE A POINT TO THIS?

13:44.220 --> 13:45.778
- THERE'S A POINT.
THIS.

13:45.820 --> 13:48.755
THERE'S A NEW SHERIFF
IN TOWN, GUYS.

13:48.790 --> 13:50.951
IT'S ME.

13:50.990 --> 13:51.979
IT'S JUST FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

13:52.030 --> 13:54.999
WE ALL KNOW HOW WE FEEL
ABOUT OLD HANK.

13:55.030 --> 13:56.520
- THE MAN LOVES BEANS.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.824
- SO I'LL BE HELPING OUT
AFTER THE ACCIDENT LAST NIGHT.

13:58.870 --> 14:01.031
AND DON'T WORRY. I'M NOT
GONNA GO CHANGING TOO MUCH

14:01.070 --> 14:03.436
ABOUT THE WAY THINGS WORK
AROUND HERE.

14:03.470 --> 14:08.430
AT LEAST NOT RIGHT AWAY.
- MAYBE AFTER LUNCH.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.675
- I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY
TO SIT DOWN WITH EACH OF YOU,

14:10.710 --> 14:12.701
ASK A FEW PROBING QUESTIONS,

14:12.750 --> 14:14.377
AND...

14:15.350 --> 14:16.647
GET TO KNOW YOU
A LITTLE BETTER.

14:19.490 --> 14:20.457
WE CAN DO THAT LATER.

14:20.490 --> 14:21.855
YEAH.

14:24.030 --> 14:25.258
THEY'RE NOT VERY HELPFUL,
ARE THEY?

14:25.290 --> 14:26.723
- HOW ABOUT I WEAR THE SPURS?

14:26.760 --> 14:28.296
- HOW ABOUT THE SHERIFF
WEARS THE SPURS?

14:28.330 --> 14:31.367
- HOW ABOUT YOU KISS
MY BLACKSMITH ASS?

14:39.670 --> 14:41.137
- CARLTON!
[hangs up phone]

14:41.180 --> 14:42.499
THAT WAS COUNTY.

14:42.540 --> 14:43.700
THEY GOT AN I.D. ON THE BODY
OUTSIDE OF OLD SONORA.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.899
HE'S A SANTA BARBARA RESIDENT.

14:44.950 --> 14:46.508
- YES, THAT IS AWESOME!

14:46.550 --> 14:48.279
- WOW. OKAY.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.514
- THAT'S GONNA AT LEAST GET US

14:49.550 --> 14:50.881
SOME SORT OF ACCESS
TO THIS CASE.

14:50.920 --> 14:51.944
I'M CALLING
THE COUNTY SHERIFF.

14:51.990 --> 14:54.311
- IT GETS
A LITTLE MORE STRANGE.

14:54.360 --> 14:57.124
- WHAT, HE'S A HOBO,
A DRIFTER,

14:57.160 --> 14:58.422
SOME SORT OF PSYCHO
WITH A LONGSTANDING GRUDGE

14:58.460 --> 15:00.121
AGAINST BELOVED
CHILDHOOD INSTITUTIONS?

15:00.160 --> 15:02.958
- HE'S A MULTIMILLIONAIRE
BUSINESSMAN. FRANK MCBAIN.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.888
GOT A BIG HOUSE UP ON THE HILL.
BEEN MISSING FOR A FEW DAYS.

15:04.930 --> 15:06.466
WIFE THOUGHT HE WAS
ON A BUSINESS TRIP.

15:06.500 --> 15:10.106
- ALL RIGHT,
SO LET'S FIGURE OUT

15:10.140 --> 15:11.869
WHAT HE WAS DOING
WANDERING ALONE

15:11.910 --> 15:13.798
IN THE HILLS OF OLD SONORA
IN SNEAKERS AND SHORTS.

15:13.840 --> 15:15.535
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'M GONNA CALL A BUDDY OF MINE

15:15.580 --> 15:18.276
WHO'S A COUNTY JUDGE, GET
A WARRANT FOR MCBAIN'S OFFICE.

15:20.480 --> 15:24.018
- CARLTON, THE MCBAIN HOMICIDE
IS A COUNTY CASE.

15:24.050 --> 15:26.848
THE CHIEF MADE IT VERY CLEAR
YOU ARE NOT TO GET INVOLVED.

15:26.890 --> 15:28.187
- DAMN IT, O'HARA,
WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON?

15:28.220 --> 15:30.120
- I AM JUST FOLLOWING
JURISDICTIONAL PROTOCOL

15:30.160 --> 15:31.388
LIKE YOU TAUGHT ME TO DO.

15:32.830 --> 15:36.220
- WELL, SOMETIMES
THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS.

15:45.670 --> 15:47.274
- LOOK AT THIS.

15:47.310 --> 15:49.505
ALL OF THE ACREAGE
AROUND OLD SONORA

15:49.540 --> 15:51.405
HAS BEEN PURCHASED
BY MCBAIN, WHICH MEANS

15:51.450 --> 15:53.816
THE ONLY LAND
THAT HE DOESN'T OWN IS HANK'S.

15:53.850 --> 15:55.772
- AND HANK WILL NEVER SELL.

15:55.820 --> 15:57.185
- WHAT'S THIS?
- THAT'S THE NEW TOLL ROAD.

15:57.220 --> 15:59.780
- THIS ROAD'S SUPPOSED TO RUN
TEN MILES SOUTH OF HERE.

15:59.820 --> 16:01.708
- NOT NECESSARILY. THE COUNCIL
HASN'T MADE ITS FINAL VOTE YET.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.887
- SO WHAT DID MCBAIN KNOW
THAT WE DON'T?

16:05.560 --> 16:07.425
- MCBAIN WANTED OLD SONORA.

16:07.460 --> 16:08.552
- AND HE WOULD DO ANYTHING
TO GET IT,

16:08.600 --> 16:09.726
INCLUDING WRECKING THE TOWN,

16:09.760 --> 16:11.125
TRYING TO GET THE COUNTY
TO SHUT IT DOWN,

16:11.170 --> 16:12.421
AND NOW GETTING HANK
RUN OVER BY HORSES.

16:12.470 --> 16:13.869
- WE SOLVED IT!

16:13.900 --> 16:15.197
OW.

16:15.240 --> 16:17.162
- DETECTIVE LASSITER AND O'HARA,

16:17.210 --> 16:19.861
YOU REMEMBER SHERIFF BECKER FROM
THE COUNTY SHERIFF'S OFFICE.

16:19.910 --> 16:21.207
- UH...

16:21.240 --> 16:22.502
- SHERIFF BECKER
JUST INFORMED ME THAT YOU TWO

16:22.540 --> 16:24.405
HAVE BEEN STICKING YOUR NOSES
INTO HIS INVESTIGATION,

16:24.450 --> 16:27.214
WHICH I RECALL SPECIFICALLY
TELLING YOU NOT TO DO.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.070
- WE HAVE CAUSE, CHIEF.

16:29.120 --> 16:31.008
WE BELIEVE MCBAIN
WAS USING VANDALISM

16:31.050 --> 16:33.416
TO RUN A CHERISHED LOCAL
INSTITUTION OUT OF BUSINESS.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.815
- THE NAME OF
THIS CHERISHED LOCAL INSTITUTION

16:35.860 --> 16:37.418
WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE OLD SONORA?

16:37.460 --> 16:39.428
- THAT'S REALLY NEITHER HERE
NOR THERE, CHIEF.

16:39.460 --> 16:41.928
THE FACT IS WE HAVE BLOWN
THIS CASE WIDE OPEN.

16:41.960 --> 16:44.269
- WELL, I HOPE YOU HAVE
SOME SOLID EVIDENCE

16:44.300 --> 16:45.767
TO SUPPORT THOSE ACCUSATIONS.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.392
- OF COURSE I DO.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.238
IT'S OBVIOUS
WHY MCBAIN WANTED THE LAND.

16:50.270 --> 16:52.807
HE'S BUILDING
A MASS TRANSIT SYSTEM

16:52.840 --> 16:54.478
IN ASSOCIATION
WITH THE NEW TOLL ROAD.

16:54.510 --> 16:57.445
PROBABLY AT TAXPAYERS' EXPENSE,
THE HEARTLESS BASTARD.

16:57.480 --> 16:58.845
- THAT'S A KIDDIE RAILROAD.

17:02.980 --> 17:07.019
IT'S A FREE PARK THAT MCBAIN
IS DONATING TO THE COUNTY.

17:07.060 --> 17:10.382
HERE'S THE PERMIT.

17:10.430 --> 17:12.386
- HE'S CALLING IT
THE ASHLEY BAIRD PARK.

17:12.430 --> 17:14.227
HE'S NOT EVEN NAMING IT
AFTER HIS WIFE.

17:14.260 --> 17:15.420
THIS WOMAN IS PROBABLY
HIS MISTRESS,

17:15.460 --> 17:17.189
WHICH MAKES HIM A TWO-TIMER.

17:17.230 --> 17:19.369
- ASHLEY BAIRD.

17:19.400 --> 17:21.095
WASN'T SHE THE LITTLE GIRL
WHO HAD LEUKEMIA?

17:21.140 --> 17:22.789
- SHE WAS SO BRAVE.

17:24.570 --> 17:27.004
- OKAY, CHIEF, MAYBE I JUMPED
THE GUN A LITTLE BIT HERE,

17:27.040 --> 17:29.907
BUT THIS MCBAIN IS ONE BAD
HOMBRE, YOU GOT TO BELIEVE ME.

17:29.940 --> 17:31.476
AND WE CAN CONSIDER
THIS VANDALISM CASE

17:31.510 --> 17:32.704
COMPLETELY CLOSED.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.217
THERE'S JUST A FEW LOOSE ENDS
TO TIE UP.

17:34.250 --> 17:36.468
- VANDALIS--WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT MURDER!

17:36.520 --> 17:39.887
- AND NOW WE GOT
A PRIME SUSPECT.

17:39.920 --> 17:41.581
- YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SUSPECTS.
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:41.620 --> 17:44.418
- THE PERSON WHO OWNS OLD SONORA
WHO WOULDN'T SELL.

17:46.460 --> 17:49.452
- NO, NO,
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.

17:51.970 --> 17:55.337
DANG IT, HANK, WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME ABOUT FRANK MCBAIN?

17:55.370 --> 17:57.258
- YOU WATCH YOUR LANGUAGE,
BINKY,

17:57.310 --> 17:58.937
AND WHO THE HELL
IS FRANK MCBAIN?

17:58.970 --> 18:00.506
- HE'S BEEN TRYING
TO BUY YOUR LAND

18:00.540 --> 18:01.939
FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS.

18:01.980 --> 18:04.278
HANK, YOU CANNOT KEEP THIS KIND
OF INFORMATION FROM US.

18:04.310 --> 18:05.607
WE ARE KILLING OURSELVES

18:05.650 --> 18:07.117
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHO MAY WANT TO HURT YOU,

18:07.150 --> 18:09.118
AND YOU LEAVE A PRIME SUSPECT
OFF THE TABLE?

18:09.150 --> 18:11.482
- NO, THE ONLY FOLKS TRYING
TO BUY MY LAND

18:11.520 --> 18:13.249
IS THE SWEETWATER LAND CORP.

18:15.290 --> 18:16.450
- I'LL BET MCBAIN USED

18:16.490 --> 18:18.458
DUMMY CORPORATIONS TO MAKE
THE PURCHASES.

18:18.490 --> 18:20.321
IT KEEPS PRICES
FROM SKYROCKETING

18:20.360 --> 18:23.466
WHEN INVESTORS SEE
WHAT'S GOING ON.

18:24.370 --> 18:26.827
- WELL, IT'S A GOOD THING
SHE'S PRETTY.

18:26.870 --> 18:29.065
NOW SWEETWATER LAND
DON'T WANT TO HURT ME.

18:29.100 --> 18:30.135
THEY SENT ME TWO LETTERS

18:30.170 --> 18:31.432
SIX MONTHS AGO.

18:31.470 --> 18:32.801
I POLITELY DECLINED,

18:32.840 --> 18:34.603
AND I NEVER HEARD FROM 'EM
AGAIN.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.629
- ARE YOU SURE?

18:35.680 --> 18:36.931
'CAUSE MCBAIN'S SECRETARY SAID

18:36.980 --> 18:38.277
HE'D ALREADY BEEN OUT
TO OLD SONORA

18:38.310 --> 18:39.971
THREE TIMES THIS MONTH ALONE.

18:40.010 --> 18:42.069
- I NEVER SPOKE
TO THE MAN.

18:42.120 --> 18:44.748
- THEN WHO DID?

18:44.790 --> 18:47.782
[harmonica plays
Oh! Susanna]

18:53.830 --> 18:55.718
- WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?

18:55.760 --> 18:56.897
[door slams]

18:56.930 --> 18:59.364
- THIS IS CALLED 19-CARD STUD.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.560
- REGULAR POKER'S
TOO COMPLICATED.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.693
IT MAKES IT EASIER
TO GET PAIRS.

19:02.740 --> 19:05.334
- PLUS, ANYTHING
WITH A PICTURE'S WILD.

19:05.370 --> 19:08.533
- WHY AREN'T YOU TWO OUT
INTERVIEWING SUSPECT S

19:08.580 --> 19:10.548
OR FEELING THE WALLS OR WHATEVER
THE HELL IT IS YOU DO?

19:10.580 --> 19:11.569
AT LEAST DO SOMETHING.

19:11.610 --> 19:13.043
- MAN, I TRIED.

19:13.080 --> 19:15.810
I DID.
THESE PEOPLE ARE KIND OF MEAN.

19:15.850 --> 19:17.943
IT'S A TOUGH RACKET
BEING SHERIFF, LASSIE.

19:17.990 --> 19:21.289
BESIDES, I GOT TO GO GUN DOWN

19:21.320 --> 19:22.878
THAT STINKY FEET FELLOW
IN ABOUT 20 MINUTES.

19:22.920 --> 19:24.854
- STINKY PETE.
- YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

19:24.890 --> 19:26.858
YOU'VE NEVER KILLED A MAN.
- YES, I HAVE.

19:26.890 --> 19:29.597
- YEAH, BUT YOU'VE
NEVER PRETEND-KILLED ONE.

19:29.630 --> 19:32.190
REPEATEDLY.
STRUGGLE WITH IT EVERY TIME.

19:32.230 --> 19:33.333
- TWO TIMES NOW.

19:33.900 --> 19:35.697
- YUP. BOTH TIMES.

19:35.740 --> 19:37.537
- WELL, WHILE YOU TWO WERE
SITTING HERE PLAYING COWBOYS

19:37.570 --> 19:40.437
AND INDIANS...
- UTT-UTT. JUST COWBOYS, LASSIE.

19:40.480 --> 19:41.799
- INJUNS IS OFFENSIVE.

19:41.840 --> 19:43.478
- I DIDN'T SAY INJUNS,
GUSTER.

19:43.510 --> 19:44.807
- THAT'S WHAT I HEARD.
- ME TOO.

19:44.850 --> 19:46.044
- WOULD YOU JUST SHUT UP?

19:46.080 --> 19:48.241
HANK HAS MANAGED TO BECOME
OUR NUMBER ONE SUSPECT.

19:48.280 --> 19:49.747
MCBAIN WANTED HIS LAND,

19:49.780 --> 19:50.849
AND HE WAS TALKING
TO SOMEBODY HERE.

19:50.890 --> 19:53.984
YOU TWO NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO IT WAS.

19:54.020 --> 19:55.612
- YOU WERE THINKING TODAY?

19:55.660 --> 19:57.252
- A MAN'S LIFE
IS ON THE LINE.

19:57.290 --> 19:58.587
GET OUT THERE,
AND GET ME A LEAD.

20:01.960 --> 20:04.099
- MAN'S ALL HOPPED UP
ON CACTUS JUICE.

20:04.130 --> 20:05.768
- [sighs]

20:05.800 --> 20:08.928
[plays harmonica]

20:10.100 --> 20:11.135
LET'S START AT THE SALOON.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.865
- YEP.
LITTLE LADY.

20:17.710 --> 20:19.143
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:19.180 --> 20:21.774
- EXACTLY WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.310
H EE-YAW!

20:23.720 --> 20:26.587
HEE-YAW NOW.

20:29.320 --> 20:31.151
WHOA.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.098
- REALLY?

20:45.170 --> 20:47.434
- GUS!
IT'S STINKY FEET!

20:48.740 --> 20:50.037
HE'S TRYING
TO BUSHWHACK US!

20:50.080 --> 20:51.274
- BUSHWHACK US?

20:51.810 --> 20:55.473
[gunfire]

20:57.790 --> 20:58.814
SHAWN! THAT'S NOT STINKY PETE.

20:58.850 --> 21:00.818
HE'S A TOURIST.

21:02.960 --> 21:05.019
- OH, YEAH.

21:05.060 --> 21:07.528
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

21:08.600 --> 21:10.659
SORRY ABOUT THAT, FRIEND.

21:10.700 --> 21:13.168
MAN IN MY LINE OF WORK
CAN'T AFFORD TO BE TOO CAREFUL.

21:13.200 --> 21:14.394
I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND.

21:16.170 --> 21:21.369
WELL, HELLO, MISS ANNIE.
- YEAH, HI, SHAWN.

21:21.410 --> 21:24.470
- YOU KNOW, I'D APPRECIATE IT
IF YOU'D REFER TO ME

21:24.510 --> 21:27.911
AS SHERIFF SPENCER...
OR HICKORY POT.

21:27.950 --> 21:29.577
OR DRY GULCH SLIM.

21:29.620 --> 21:31.212
ANY OF THOSE WOULD DO ME
JUST FINE.

21:31.250 --> 21:32.842
- YEAH, WELL,
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

21:32.890 --> 21:34.016
- FAIR ENOUGH.

21:34.060 --> 21:35.152
- HOW LONG
HAVE YOU BEEN DOING THIS?

21:36.620 --> 21:39.350
FIVE YEARS HERE.
BEFORE THAT AT DISNEYLAND.

21:39.390 --> 21:41.620
- THEY HAVE MADAMS
AT DISNEYLAND?

21:41.660 --> 21:43.298
- NO, I WORKED THE TEACUPS.

21:43.330 --> 21:45.491
- I'LL BET YOU DID.

21:45.530 --> 21:47.464
WELL, I'M GONNA HAVE TO ASK YOU

21:47.500 --> 21:50.833
A COUPLE OF UNCOMFORTABLE-TYPE
QUESTIONS ABOUT HANK.

21:50.870 --> 21:52.030
- OH, YOU MEAN
THAT WE WERE LOVERS?

21:52.070 --> 21:55.801
- YOU--NO.
NOT--NOT THAT UNCOMFORTABLE, NO.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.705
- HE BROKE MY HEART.

21:59.680 --> 22:01.819
BUT THAT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.

22:01.850 --> 22:03.841
ANCIENT HISTORY.

22:09.290 --> 22:10.951
[footsteps]

22:10.990 --> 22:12.685
- HEY, THERE.

22:12.730 --> 22:13.958
YOU THE ONE THAT PLAYS

22:14.000 --> 22:15.991
DEPUTY SHERIFF TRIPSY,
IS THAT RIGHT?

22:16.030 --> 22:20.399
- THAT'S WHAT IT SAYS ON MY
PAYCHECK IF I STILL GET ONE.

22:20.440 --> 22:23.329
- SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE NOT TOO
HAPPY WITH YOUR JOB RIGHT NOW.

22:23.370 --> 22:26.601
- MAYBE YOU'RE ANGRY ENOUGH TO
TAKE IT OUT ON YOUR BOSS HANK.

22:26.640 --> 22:28.198
MAYBE YOU POISONED THE WATER

22:28.240 --> 22:30.003
SO THAT YOU COULD HAVE
OLD SONORA

22:30.040 --> 22:31.405
ALL TO YOURSELF.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.668
- MAYBE EVEN ENOUGH
TO KILL FOR IT?

22:33.720 --> 22:37.440
- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

22:37.490 --> 22:40.880
AND AS FAR AS HANK GOES,
I LOVE THE MAN LIKE A BROTHER.

22:40.920 --> 22:42.911
- [scoffs]
PLEASE.

22:42.960 --> 22:44.086
THAT'S WHAT EVERYONE SAYS.

22:44.130 --> 22:46.451
- WHO'S EVERYONE?
- MISS ANNIE.

22:46.490 --> 22:48.594
- NO, DUDE, SHE DOESN'T LOVE HIM
LIKE A BROTHER.

22:48.630 --> 22:50.495
DEFINITELY NOT LIKE A BROTHER.

22:50.530 --> 22:52.464
UNLESS THEY HAVE
A REALLY WEIRD FAMILY.

22:52.500 --> 22:54.058
THEY GOT SOME SERIOUS FLOWERS
UP IN THAT ATTIC.

22:54.100 --> 22:55.431
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

22:55.470 --> 22:57.609
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

23:01.610 --> 23:05.979
DUDE, HE WAS THERE
BEFORE THE HORSES TRAMPLED HANK.

23:06.010 --> 23:07.511
- LET'S GET HIM.
- WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

23:07.550 --> 23:10.747
NOT SO FAST THERE, TRIPSY.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.714
YOU SEE, WE KNOW THAT YOU WERE
AT THE CORRAL THE OTHER NIGHT.

23:13.760 --> 23:15.057
AND JUST FOR THE RECORD,

23:15.090 --> 23:16.978
YOUR NICKNAME
IS EXTREMELY OFFENSIVE.

23:17.020 --> 23:19.079
- SO I WAS UP THERE.

23:19.130 --> 23:21.155
SOMETHING SPOOKED THE HORSES,
AND I WENT UP TO CHECK ON 'EM.

23:21.200 --> 23:24.397
AND I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE
OF WHOEVER IT WAS TOO.

23:24.430 --> 23:26.398
AND THEN HE VANISHED.

23:26.430 --> 23:29.297
- OOH.

23:29.340 --> 23:31.433
YOU'RE TRYING TO TELL US

23:31.470 --> 23:33.609
IT WAS THE GHOST RIDER
WHO TRIED TO KILL HANK?

23:33.640 --> 23:34.675
PLEASE.

23:34.710 --> 23:35.677
- I DON'T LIKE YOUR TONE,
MISTER.

23:35.710 --> 23:37.075
- IS THAT RIGHT?

23:37.110 --> 23:38.748
'CAUSE I'VE BEEN TOLD
IT'S QUITE SOOTHING.

23:38.780 --> 23:41.169
- SHAWN, TRY TO STAY ON POINT.

23:41.220 --> 23:42.642
- I THINK YOU'RE LYING,
TRIPSY.

23:42.680 --> 23:44.409
I THINK IT WAS YOU
WHO SPOOKED THE HORSES

23:44.450 --> 23:46.281
BECAUSE YOU KNEW DAG GUM WELL

23:46.320 --> 23:47.344
THAT HANK WOULD COME RUNNING.

23:47.390 --> 23:49.210
- THAT'S A LIE!

23:49.260 --> 23:50.579
I LOVE HANK MENDEL.

23:50.630 --> 23:54.999
- GUS, GET THE COUNTY SHERIFF
OFFICE ON THE PHONE.

23:55.030 --> 23:57.328
YOU TELL 'EM WE FOUND OURSELVES
THE VANDAL

23:57.360 --> 24:00.022
AND THAT HE MIGHT HAVE
JUST KILLED MCBAIN TOO.

24:00.070 --> 24:02.231
- OKAY, OKAY, BOYS.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.500
I DIDN'T SEE NOBODY.

24:04.540 --> 24:06.167
BUT SOMETHING
SPOOKED THE HORSES,

24:06.210 --> 24:07.529
AND IT WASN'T ME, I SWEAR.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.229
YEAH, I WAS UP THERE.

24:09.280 --> 24:12.147
IT WAS FOR A DIFFERENT REASON.

24:12.180 --> 24:13.647
I WAS WORKING FOR MCBAIN.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.342
- MM-HMM.
GO ON.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.817
- HE WAS PAYING ME
TO MAKE A LIST

24:20.860 --> 24:22.452
OF ALL THE SAFETY VIOLATIONS

24:22.490 --> 24:23.457
WE GOT AROUND THIS PLACE.

24:23.490 --> 24:25.151
AND HE WAS GONNA USE 'EM

24:25.190 --> 24:26.748
TO FORCE THE COUNTY
TO SHUT US DOWN.

24:26.790 --> 24:29.725
AI-TER THAT, WELL,
HANK WOULD HAVE NO CHOICE

24:29.760 --> 24:31.489
BUT TO SELL TO MCBAIN.

24:31.530 --> 24:34.033
- AND YOU SAY HE WAS LIKE
A BROTHER TO YOU.

24:34.070 --> 24:37.096
- HEY, I AIN'T PROUD
OF WHAT I DONE, MISTER.

24:40.270 --> 24:42.101
[sighs]

24:47.180 --> 24:49.045
- HEY, ARE THERE ANY OTHER
EMPLOYEES STILL HERE?

24:49.080 --> 24:50.069
- UH, NO.

24:50.120 --> 24:51.246
WHEN HANK'S NOT AROUND,

24:51.290 --> 24:52.643
I'M ALWAYS THE LAST ONE
TO LEAVE.

24:52.690 --> 24:55.215
- SHAWN.

24:57.860 --> 24:59.782
[horse neighs]

24:59.830 --> 25:01.195
IS THAT THE...

25:01.230 --> 25:02.299
- GHOST RIDER.

25:02.330 --> 25:03.763
[horse neighs]

25:13.940 --> 25:16.909
- HE MUST HAVE GONE IN THERE.

25:23.150 --> 25:24.686
THAT'S COMPLETELY SEALED.

25:24.720 --> 25:26.278
THERE'S NO WAY
HE GOT THROUGH THERE.

25:26.320 --> 25:27.651
- UNLESS HE CAN
MOVE THROUGH SOLIDS,

25:27.690 --> 25:29.157
WHICH, BY DEFINITION,
HE CAN.

25:29.190 --> 25:31.021
- REALLY? WE HAVE TO HAVE
THAT CONVERSATION?

25:31.060 --> 25:31.958
- FINE.

25:34.160 --> 25:35.388
[bubbles]

25:35.430 --> 25:37.398
MAYBE THE GUY ON THE HORSE

25:37.430 --> 25:38.567
IS NOT A GHOST.

25:38.600 --> 25:40.192
AND LET'S SAY HE IS THE VANDAL,

25:40.230 --> 25:41.538
WHICH DOESN'T EVEN MAKE SENSE,

25:41.570 --> 25:43.231
BECAUSE THE GUY WHO WANTED
THE LAND IS DEAD.

25:43.270 --> 25:44.498
EVEN SO,
THERE'S STILL SOMETHING

25:44.540 --> 25:45.666
WE HAVEN'T TAKEN
INTO ACCOUNT YET.

25:45.710 --> 25:47.302
- YEAH, WHAT'S THAT?

25:47.340 --> 25:49.535
- WHAT IF MCBAIN'S MURDER
IS RELATED TO SOMETHING ELSE?

25:49.580 --> 25:51.047
OR JUST A RANDOM ACT
OF VIOLENCE?

25:51.080 --> 25:52.445
I'LL GO EVEN FURTHER.

25:52.480 --> 25:54.948
WHAT IF THE GUY ON THE HORSE
IS NOT VANDALIZING THE TOWN?

25:54.980 --> 25:55.969
WHAT IF NO ONE IS?

25:56.020 --> 25:57.373
YOU SAID IT YOURSELF, SHAWN.

25:57.420 --> 25:59.843
WHAT IF THIS PLACE IS SO RUNDOWN
FROM NEGLECT AND OLD AGE

25:59.890 --> 26:04.088
THAT IT'S FALLING APART, HUH?

26:04.130 --> 26:05.552
[creaking]

26:13.840 --> 26:16.092
- I SEE YOUR POINT.

26:20.680 --> 26:21.977
- A GHOST?

26:22.010 --> 26:23.170
- MAYBE A GHOST.

26:23.210 --> 26:24.575
- DEFINITELY NOT A GHOST.

26:24.610 --> 26:25.804
BUT A GHOST-LIKE FELLA.

26:25.850 --> 26:27.579
AN ETHEREAL MOONLIGHT FIGURE.

26:27.620 --> 26:29.247
- WHO MIGHT BE ABLE
TO GO THROUGH ROCKS.

26:29.280 --> 26:30.884
- BUT PROBABLY NOT.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.138
- I SENT YOU OUT THERE
TO INVESTIGATE FOR TWO DAYS,

26:33.190 --> 26:35.055
AND ALL YOU COME BACK WITH
IS CAMPFIRE STORIES?

26:35.090 --> 26:36.114
- GUS GOT THE CONSUMPTION.

26:36.160 --> 26:39.459
- I DID--
[coughs]

26:39.490 --> 26:41.321
- WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

26:41.360 --> 26:42.725
- COSTUME PARTY.

26:42.760 --> 26:44.864
- AND THIS WOULDN'T
HAVE ANYTHING TO DO

26:44.900 --> 26:46.629
WITH THE OLD SONORA,
WOULD IT?

26:46.670 --> 26:49.230
- SORRY, WHICH ONE'S OLD SONORA
AGAIN?

26:49.270 --> 26:51.261
- YOU KNOW, I DON'T WANT
TO HEAR IT, DETECTIVE.

26:51.310 --> 26:53.562
AND IF I FIND OUT THAT YOU HIRED
SPENCER AND GUSTER

26:53.610 --> 26:55.703
ON YOUR OWN, THEN THAT
CONSTITUTES A CONFLICT

26:55.740 --> 26:57.605
OF INTEREST AND THERE WILL BE
DISCIPLINARY MEASURES.

26:57.650 --> 27:01.347
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU
STICK TO YOUR ASSIGNED CASES.

27:03.620 --> 27:05.315
- GEE, THANKS
FOR HOPPING IN THERE

27:05.350 --> 27:07.181
AND TAKING SOME OF THE HEAT
FROM THE CHIEF, SPENCER.

27:07.220 --> 27:08.289
- WELL, YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

27:08.320 --> 27:09.548
- I WAS BEING FACETIOUS.

27:09.590 --> 27:11.126
- YEAH, YOU WIMPED OUT.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.425
- IF YOU BELIEVE
THE SHORT-SIDED PUNDITS ON CNN,

27:14.460 --> 27:16.496
BUT I TAKE A LONGER VIEW
OF HISTORY.

27:16.530 --> 27:19.067
- THAT DOESN'T EVEN MAKE
ANY SENSE.

27:19.100 --> 27:21.694
CORONER'S REPORT SAID
MCBAIN'S BEEN DEAD
FOR FIVE DAYS.

27:21.740 --> 27:23.867
YET THE VAN DALISM
HASN'T STOPPED SINCE THEN.

27:23.910 --> 27:26.367
THEREFORE, WE CAN EFFECT IVELY
ELIMINATE MCBAIN.

27:26.410 --> 27:29.800
I'M NOW SENSING THAT
SOMEONE ELSE WANTS THAT LAND.

27:29.840 --> 27:32.240
MCBAIN'S GOT THE KIND OF MONEY
THAT'S TOUGH TO BEAT.

27:32.280 --> 27:36.239
AS A RESULT, HE OR SHE...
- OR EVEN A HE-SHE.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.214
- HAD TO KILL MCBAIN
BEFORE HE GOT IT.

27:38.250 --> 27:39.911
- HE WAS ELIMINATING
THE COMPETITION.

27:39.950 --> 27:41.588
- PRECISELY.

27:41.620 --> 27:43.019
- OKAY.

27:43.060 --> 27:45.051
YEAH, MAYBE.

27:45.090 --> 27:47.354
AND WHEN I FIND
THIS MURDERING SCUM,

27:47.390 --> 27:48.721
I'M GONNA SHOOT HIM
IN THE FACE.

27:50.130 --> 27:52.519
NOT ENTIRELY. THAT'S
ALL JUST WISHFUL THINKING.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.333
WE DON'T HAVE THE VAGUEST CLUE
WHO THIS BASTARD IS.

27:54.370 --> 27:57.635
NO THANKS TO YOU SPENCER.
SO FAR YOU'VE GIVEN ME BUBKES.

27:57.670 --> 28:01.379
GET BACK OUT THERE,
AND GET TO WORK.

28:03.950 --> 28:04.905
- HE JUST SAID...

28:04.950 --> 28:05.974
- BUBKES.
- YEAH.

28:12.590 --> 28:14.057
THE THING IS,
YOU NEVER HAVE TO WONDER

28:14.090 --> 28:15.648
WHY LASSIE DOESN'T HAVE
MORE FRIENDS.

28:15.690 --> 28:18.488
[laughs]
HANK?

28:18.530 --> 28:19.724
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE, MAN?

28:19.760 --> 28:21.398
YOU SHOULD BE RESTING.

28:21.430 --> 28:23.648
YOU DIDN'T COME BACK
FOR THE SPURS, DID YOU?

28:23.700 --> 28:24.769
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

28:24.800 --> 28:25.789
- I'M LEAVING TOWN.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.229
- WHY?

28:27.270 --> 28:28.669
- WELL, I BEEN LICKED.

28:28.700 --> 28:30.588
WHOLE BUILDINGS
ARE STARTING TO FALL.

28:30.640 --> 28:31.629
BETTER I JUST MOVE ON

28:31.670 --> 28:33.206
AND FORGET THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

28:33.240 --> 28:35.777
- LOOK, HANK, I ADMIT,
IT'S A LONG SHOT,

28:35.810 --> 28:38.278
BUT THERE'S STILL A CHANCE
THAT WE COULD SAVE OLD SONORA.

28:38.310 --> 28:40.505
- I'VE SEEN THE PARK
THEY WANT TO BUILD.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.040
IT'S A NICE PLACE.

28:42.080 --> 28:44.640
AND I BELIEVE THAT FOLKS
ARE GONNA WANT TO GO THERE.

28:44.690 --> 28:45.782
I'M AN OLD RELIC.

28:45.820 --> 28:48.311
I'VE KNOWN THAT
FOR A LONG TIME.

28:48.360 --> 28:50.920
- LOOK, HANK, WE CAN--I MEAN,
WE CAN FIX THE BUILDINGS.

28:50.960 --> 28:52.450
WE'LL JUST GET SOME NAILS.

28:52.490 --> 28:54.048
- AND FEBREZE.

28:54.100 --> 28:55.829
- OH, FELLAS,
THAT SOUNDS AWFUL GOOD,

28:55.860 --> 28:57.964
BUT, NO, IT'S TOO LATE,
BOYS.

28:58.000 --> 28:59.729
I'VE ALREADY CONTACTED
THE FOLKS

28:59.770 --> 29:02.261
OVER AT SWEETWATER LAND
AND ACCEPTED THEIR OFFER.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.837
OLD TRIPSY, HE'S GONNA HANDLE
THE LAST SHOW.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.132
ME, I'M DONE.

29:09.010 --> 29:10.875
- I GUESS THAT'S THAT.

29:13.010 --> 29:16.878
- THIS LIST OF POSSIBLE SUSPECT S
IS GARBAGE.

29:16.920 --> 29:18.512
- DETECTIVES, A MOMENT.

29:18.550 --> 29:19.983
NOW.

29:22.990 --> 29:25.720
- LOOK, CHIEF,
IF THIS IS ABOUT THE...

29:26.960 --> 29:28.552
ALL RIGHT, CHIEF,
I JUST WANT TO SAY

29:28.600 --> 29:31.068
THAT I AM 100% SURE
THAT YOU HAVE NO PROOF

29:31.100 --> 29:32.624
WHATSOEVER THAT
I HAVE DONE ANYTHING

29:32.670 --> 29:35.639
EVEN REMOTELY OLD SONORA-RELATED
IN THE LAST TWO HOURS.

29:35.670 --> 29:38.036
- SHERIFF BECKER WOULD LIKE
TO FORMALLY INVITE YOU

29:38.070 --> 29:39.537
INTO THE MCBAIN CASE.

29:39.570 --> 29:41.902
- OH, THANK GOD, 'CAUSE I WAS
TOTALLY LYING JUST THEN.

29:43.480 --> 29:44.947
SHERIFF, WHAT CAN I DO FOR YA?

29:44.980 --> 29:47.676
- JUST RECEIVED
THE BALLISTICS REPORT.

29:47.710 --> 29:49.712
THE GUYS IN OUR LAB SAID
THEY'VE NEVER SEEN A SLUG

29:49.750 --> 29:52.514
LIKE THE ONE THEY PULLED OUT
OF MCBAIN, AND...

29:52.550 --> 29:54.552
WELL, I THOUGHT...

29:55.720 --> 29:59.850
BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPERTISE
WITH FIREARMS...

30:01.930 --> 30:04.364
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP
IDENTIFY IT.

30:10.740 --> 30:13.732
- THEY'VE NEVER SEEN
A BULLET LIKE THIS

30:13.770 --> 30:14.873
'CAUSE IT'S OVER 100 YEARS OLD.

30:17.610 --> 30:19.544
- WHAT KIND OF A GUN
USES A SLUG LIKE THAT?

30:20.650 --> 30:24.746
- AN ORIGINAL
1873 COLT PEACEMAKER.

30:30.720 --> 30:34.224
- YOU SURE--YOU SURE
THIS IS ALL YOU GOT, HANK?

30:34.260 --> 30:35.921
I MEAN, WE'RE GOOD ON SPACE.

30:35.960 --> 30:38.064
WE CAN GRAB YOU
A WAGON WHEEL.

30:38.100 --> 30:40.068
- OR THAT BARREL.

30:41.400 --> 30:45.530
- HANK, I NEED
TO SEE YOUR PISTOL.

30:45.570 --> 30:46.901
- WHY DO YOU NEED
TO SEE THAT?

30:46.940 --> 30:48.305
- YOU DON'T THINK
HANK HAD ANYTHING

30:48.340 --> 30:49.568
TO DO WITH MCBAIN'S DEATH?

30:49.610 --> 30:51.168
DON'T BE CRAZY.
COME ON.

30:51.210 --> 30:53.576
- SHAWN, STAY OUT OF THIS.

30:53.610 --> 30:54.975
- YOUR GUN, HANK.

30:57.220 --> 30:59.518
SLOWLY.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.465
WHY YOU BEEN FIRING
LIVE ROUNDS, HANK?

31:12.500 --> 31:15.037
- I SAW A RAT,
AND I SHOT IT.

31:16.570 --> 31:20.802
HANK MENDEL, YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER OF FRANK MCBAIN.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.137
- COME ON.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.672
- READ HIM HIS RIGHTS,
O'HARA.

31:25.710 --> 31:28.679
- YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO REMAIN SILENT...

31:40.660 --> 31:42.321
- WHY DO PEOPLE
THAT I TRY TO HELP

31:42.360 --> 31:44.191
USUALLY END UP
GETTING ARRESTED?

31:44.230 --> 31:46.061
- SHAWN, SOMETIMES PEOPLE
YOU THINK ARE INNOCENT

31:46.100 --> 31:47.624
TURN OUT TO BE GUILTY
AND VICE VERSA.

31:49.670 --> 31:51.604
THE IMPORTANT THING IS,

31:51.640 --> 31:53.699
HOW ARE YOU GONNA HELP ME GET
HANK'S BLOOD OUT OF MY COUCH?

31:53.740 --> 31:54.900
- HANK IS INNOCENT.

31:54.940 --> 31:57.238
- YEAH, CAN YOU PROVE IT?
- NOT YET.

31:57.280 --> 31:58.542
- YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT I THINK?

31:58.580 --> 32:01.549
- NO, I JUST CAME BY
FOR ONE OF YOUR INEDIBLE,

32:01.580 --> 32:03.741
FAT-FREE GRILLED CHEESE
SANDWICHES.

32:03.780 --> 32:05.281
YES, I'D LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT YOU THINK.

32:05.320 --> 32:07.641
- LASSITER IS SO EMOTIONALLY
INVESTED IN TRYING

32:07.690 --> 32:08.850
TO SAVE THIS TOWN,
YOU,

32:08.890 --> 32:10.881
IN TRYING TO HELP HIM,
HAVE DEVELOPED SOME

32:10.920 --> 32:12.387
OF THE SAME FEELINGS
AND DESIRES.

32:12.430 --> 32:14.990
IT'S A SIMPLE CASE
OF TRANSFERENCE.

32:15.030 --> 32:17.965
- YOU DON'T USE WORDS
LIKE TRANSFERENCE.

32:18.000 --> 32:19.661
HAVE YOU BEEN
SECRETLY HANGING OUT WITH MOM?

32:19.700 --> 32:23.090
- WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DINED
TOGETHER LAST WEEK.

32:23.140 --> 32:25.938
THE POINT IS, YOUR JUDGMENT
IN THIS CASE IS BEING CLOUDED

32:25.970 --> 32:27.039
BY YOUR EMOTIONS.

32:27.070 --> 32:28.469
- DINED TOGETHER?

32:28.510 --> 32:30.330
YOU'RE DAVID NIVEN NOW?
THAT'S YOUR NEW THING?

32:30.380 --> 32:31.677
- WAIT, SHAWN, LOOK.

32:31.710 --> 32:33.200
YOU THINK HANK IS INNOCENT,
GO BACK TO OLD SONORA

32:33.250 --> 32:34.877
AND GET YOURSELF SOME PROOF,
BUT THIS TIME,

32:34.920 --> 32:36.410
DON'T LOOK AT THE TOWN
AS THIS MAGICAL PLACE

32:36.450 --> 32:38.509
THAT MEANS SO MUCH
TO LASSITER.

32:38.550 --> 32:40.211
INSTEAD, LOOK AT IT
FOR WHAT IT REALLY IS--

32:40.250 --> 32:42.957
A DUMP THAT PROBABLY
ISN'T WORTH SAVING.

32:44.490 --> 32:46.549
- WE'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR OVER AN HOUR, SHAWN.

32:46.590 --> 32:47.784
I NEED A BREAK.

32:47.830 --> 32:49.354
- THERE'S GOT TO BE
A LOGICAL EXPLANATION

32:49.400 --> 32:50.992
FOR WHERE THAT HORSE
AND RIDER DISAPPEARED TO.

32:51.030 --> 32:52.224
- I'VE GOT ONE FOR YOU.

32:52.270 --> 32:53.225
THE NEXT DIMENSION.

32:53.270 --> 32:54.931
- REALLY, WINSTON ZEDDMORE?

32:54.970 --> 32:56.267
THAT'S WHAT YOU BELIEVE, HUH?

32:56.300 --> 32:57.892
- I HAVEN'T SLEPT
IN TWO DAYS, SHAWN.

32:57.940 --> 32:59.305
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE.

32:59.340 --> 33:01.399
[bubbles]

33:01.440 --> 33:02.509
WHAT?

33:02.540 --> 33:04.349
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

33:04.380 --> 33:05.870
- I'M NOT SURE.

33:05.910 --> 33:09.175
[cracking]

33:09.220 --> 33:10.710
[screams]

33:15.190 --> 33:18.182
[pained whimpering
and groaning]

33:21.830 --> 33:23.798
I THINK I BROKE MY BACK.

33:23.830 --> 33:24.819
AND MY NECK.

33:24.870 --> 33:26.724
AND MY ARM.

33:26.770 --> 33:30.262
- THAT'S NOTHING.
I JUST BRUISED MY COCCYX.

33:30.300 --> 33:31.858
- SAY WHAT?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN.

33:31.910 --> 33:33.468
- I MOST CERTAINLY DO NOT.

33:33.510 --> 33:35.774
- WHEN I GET HOME, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO RUB OIL ON MY COCCYX.

33:35.810 --> 33:37.778
- OH, GUS, PLEASE.
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

33:37.810 --> 33:40.779
- WHAT? A DEEP-TISSUE MASSAGE IS
DEFINITELY WHAT MY COCCYX NEEDS.

33:40.810 --> 33:42.175
- WOULD YOU STOP SAYING
THAT WORD?

33:42.220 --> 33:45.348
- COCCYX?
THAT'S WHAT IT'S CALLED, SHAWN.

33:45.390 --> 33:47.688
[groans]

33:47.720 --> 33:49.187
- DUDE...

33:49.220 --> 33:53.919
THIS MUST BE A PART
OF THE OLD MINE SHAFT.

33:53.960 --> 33:55.496
IT'S NO WONDER
IT'S NOT ON THE TOUR.

33:55.530 --> 33:58.192
IT'S COMPLETELY UNAUTHENTIC.

33:58.230 --> 34:00.061
LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT TH ESE TOOLS.

34:00.100 --> 34:01.397
THEY'RE ALL MODERN.

34:01.440 --> 34:03.590
- IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE BEING USED.

34:03.640 --> 34:06.131
LET ME SEE THE LIGHT.

34:10.910 --> 34:12.343
DUDE.

34:12.380 --> 34:14.177
- WHA?

34:14.220 --> 34:16.211
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

34:16.250 --> 34:17.740
THAT'S WHAT THIS WHOLE THING
IS ABOUT?

34:17.780 --> 34:19.281
COPPER?

34:19.320 --> 34:21.618
- THAT'S GOLD, SHAWN.

34:21.660 --> 34:23.753
- OH, I GUESS
THAT WOULD MAKE MORE SENSE.

34:23.790 --> 34:25.087
- SO I WAS RIGHT.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.280
OLD SONORA
WAS NEVER BEING VANDALIZED.

34:27.330 --> 34:28.524
AT LEAST NOT DELIBERATELY.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.222
- CLEARLY, I AGREE WITH YOU.

34:31.270 --> 34:32.692
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHY.

34:32.730 --> 34:34.493
- THE THEFT AND DAMAGE
ON THE SURFACE

34:34.540 --> 34:35.495
CAN BE EXPLAINED BY THE FACT

34:35.540 --> 34:37.394
THAT MINING IS GOING ON
UNDERGROUND.

34:37.440 --> 34:40.068
THE STOLEN WOOD POSTS ARE BEING
USED TO PROP UP THE SHAFT.

34:40.110 --> 34:41.577
THE CONTAMINATED WATER
AND THE SINKHOLES

34:41.610 --> 34:43.874
ARE COMMON SIDE EFFECTS
OF SHAFT MINING.

34:43.910 --> 34:48.040
THE FOUL ODOR IN THE AIR IS FROM
THE EXPOSED SULFUR DEPOSITS.

34:48.080 --> 34:50.071
THE ONLY THING
I DON'T UNDERSTAND IS,

34:50.120 --> 34:52.042
WHY WOULD A GHOST
BE MINING FOR GOLD?

34:52.090 --> 34:54.581
- IT WASN'T A GHOST, GUS.

34:54.620 --> 34:56.759
- THEN WHO IS IT?

35:04.100 --> 35:08.696
- DUDE, IT WAS
THE OTHER GUNFIGHTER.

35:10.600 --> 35:13.034
THAT STINKY FEET GUY.
[thwack]

35:16.240 --> 35:18.549
- THE NAME IS STINKY PETE.

35:22.580 --> 35:26.482
- HOLD UP!
HOLD UP! HANK.

35:27.550 --> 35:28.881
WE TESTED YOUR GUN, HANK.

35:28.920 --> 35:31.787
IT DOESN'T MATCH THE SLUG.

35:31.830 --> 35:33.650
- I TOLD YOU
IT WASN'T ME, BINKY,

35:33.690 --> 35:35.328
BUT YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN
NO MORE.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.427
- HANK, I'M SO SORRY.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.665
I NEVER SHOULD HAVE...

35:43.470 --> 35:47.065
THE MURDER WEAPON'S MOST LIKELY
AN IDENTICAL TWIN TO YOURS.

35:47.110 --> 35:52.047
- WELL, ACTUALLY, I THINK MY GUN
MIGHT HAVE BEEN PART OF A SET.

35:52.080 --> 35:53.502
IT WAS SO LONG AGO,

35:53.550 --> 35:55.017
I'D FORGOTTEN.

35:55.050 --> 35:58.679
- DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA
WHO MAY HAVE THE OTHER ONE?

35:59.890 --> 36:02.279
- AS A MATTER OF FACT,
I DO.

36:04.960 --> 36:06.325
- HOW YOU DOING OVER THERE?
- [sighs]

36:06.360 --> 36:10.194
NOW I HAVE A THROBBING HEADACHE
AND A THROBBING COCCYX.

36:10.230 --> 36:12.061
WHAT?

36:12.100 --> 36:13.863
- WHO ARE YOU REALLY?

36:13.900 --> 36:15.936
- I'M A PSYCHIC.

36:15.970 --> 36:18.837
AND I CAN SEE EVERYTHING
VERY CLEARLY NOW.

36:18.870 --> 36:21.805
JUST LIKE TRIPSY,
YOU WERE ON MCBAIN'S PAYROLL.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.899
AND WHEN YOU WENT LOOKING
FOR SAFETY VIOLATIONS,

36:23.940 --> 36:26.044
YOU DECIDED TO CHECK OUT
THE OLD MINE SHAFT,

36:26.080 --> 36:27.775
AND, AS DUMB LUCK WOULD HAVE IT,

36:27.810 --> 36:31.280
YOU FOUND YOURSELF A PREVIOUSLY
UNDISCOVERED VEIN OF GOLD.

36:31.320 --> 36:35.450
WHAT'S MORE, YOU WERE THE RIDER
THAT WE SAW LAST NIGHT.

36:35.490 --> 36:36.787
[whinnying]

36:36.820 --> 36:38.583
PULLING WOOD INTO THE ENTRANCE
OF THE MINE,

36:38.630 --> 36:40.257
WHICH ONLY APPEARED
TO BE SEALED.

36:40.290 --> 36:43.088
'CAUSE NEITHER HANK
NOR ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT TO CHECK

36:43.130 --> 36:44.688
IF THE ROCKS WERE ACTUALLY REAL.

36:44.730 --> 36:47.028
I GOT TO HAND IT TO YOU,
PETE.

36:47.070 --> 36:49.766
IT WAS QUITE A NIFTY OPERATION
YOU HAD GOING HERE.

36:49.800 --> 36:51.233
- STILL DO.

36:51.270 --> 36:55.536
- OOH-OOH. UNFORTUNATELY,
MCBAIN GOT WHAT HE NEEDED

36:55.580 --> 36:58.299
TO ENSURE THAT HANK WOULD FAIL
THE UPCOMING SAFETY INSPECTION

36:58.350 --> 37:00.409
SO OLD SONORA HAD TO CLOSE DOWN.

37:00.450 --> 37:03.374
WHEN MCBAIN TOOK OWNERSHIP
OUT OF FORECLOSURE,

37:03.420 --> 37:05.479
IT WOULDN'T TAKE LONG
FOR HIS LITTLE CONSTRUCTION CREW

37:05.520 --> 37:06.714
TO DISCOVER YOUR GOLD STRIKE,

37:06.750 --> 37:08.012
SO TO SLOW THINGS DOWN

37:08.050 --> 37:09.085
AND GIVE YOURSELF MORE TIME

37:09.120 --> 37:12.021
TO MINE, WELL,

37:12.060 --> 37:13.789
YOU WENT AHEAD
AND KILLED MCBAIN.

37:13.830 --> 37:15.991
- I COULD DENY IT,

37:16.030 --> 37:19.591
BUT THEN THERE AIN'T MUCH POINT,
IS THERE?

37:19.630 --> 37:22.030
THERE'S MORE THAN A MILLION
DOLLARS' GOLD IN HERE.

37:22.070 --> 37:24.868
- NOT ONLY ARE YOU A MURDERER,
BUT YOU'RE A THIEF.

37:24.910 --> 37:26.730
THIS GOLD BELONGS TO HANK,

37:26.770 --> 37:28.635
A MAN WHO'S BEEN MORE
THAN FAIR AND GENEROUS

37:28.680 --> 37:29.908
WITH ALL OF HIS EMPLOYEES,

37:29.940 --> 37:31.805
INCLUDING YOURSELF.

37:31.850 --> 37:34.876
- WELL, I GUESS AFTER PLAYING
A BAD GUY ALL THESE YEARS,

37:34.920 --> 37:39.812
THE LINE BETWEEN ACTOR
AND ROLE GOT KIND OF BLURRED.

37:39.850 --> 37:43.183
- HMM. THEY SAY THE SAME THING
HAPPENED TO YUL BRYNNER.

37:47.230 --> 37:50.552
HEY! HEY!

37:50.600 --> 37:52.329
NO!

37:52.370 --> 37:54.190
- [coughs]

37:56.040 --> 37:59.009
[sirens wail]

38:05.780 --> 38:06.804
- THIS IS NOT GOOD.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.548
DUDE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

38:15.590 --> 38:18.718
- IT WORKED FOR TIM ROBBINS
IN SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, SHAWN.

38:18.760 --> 38:20.648
GET BUSY LIVING
OR GET BUSY DYING.

38:20.690 --> 38:23.022
- GUS, WE DON'T HAVE YEARS
TO DIG A TUNNEL.

38:23.060 --> 38:25.290
BESIDES, IT MAKES ME
MORGAN FREEMAN.

38:25.330 --> 38:27.059
THAT'S WEIRD.

38:32.670 --> 38:34.570
WAIT A MINUTE.

38:34.610 --> 38:36.578
THAT'S WATER.

38:36.610 --> 38:37.907
DUDE, GIVE ME THE PICKAXE.

38:41.450 --> 38:43.042
WATCH YOURSELF.

38:47.950 --> 38:50.180
HYAH!

38:51.860 --> 38:54.078
YOU SEE WHAT I SEE?

38:55.630 --> 38:57.222
- STOP PUSHING, SHAWN.

38:57.260 --> 39:00.661
- DUDE, THIS TUNNEL'S
ONLY BIG ENOUGH FOR ONE PERSON.

39:13.410 --> 39:15.719
- PETE DILLINGHAM!

39:17.250 --> 39:18.683
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST
FOR THE MURDER

39:18.720 --> 39:20.312
OF FRANK MCBAIN.

39:20.350 --> 39:23.513
TH ROW YOUR WEAPON DOWN
AND COME PEACEFULLY.

39:41.040 --> 39:43.201
- HOW CAN YOU TELL
WHICH ONE'S THE BAD GUY

39:43.240 --> 39:45.674
IF THEY'RE BOTH WEARING BLACK?

40:15.680 --> 40:18.672
- BOO.
- BOO!

40:18.710 --> 40:19.847
BOO!

40:19.880 --> 40:21.006
- I'M THE GOOD GUY,

40:21.050 --> 40:22.449
YOU TOOTHLESS HILLBILLIES.

40:23.520 --> 40:27.047
- [groans]

40:27.090 --> 40:29.251
- THOUGH I DID JUST SHOOT
THAT MAN FOR REAL,

40:29.290 --> 40:30.484
SO CLEAR ON OUT.

40:34.500 --> 40:35.558
- WELL, THE GREAT NEWS IS,

40:35.600 --> 40:36.692
WITH ALL THE MONEY YOU'LL MAKE

40:36.730 --> 40:37.697
FROM SELLING GOLD,

40:37.730 --> 40:39.061
YOU CAN FIX UP OLD SONORA,

40:39.100 --> 40:40.727
RESTORE IT
TO ITS FORMER GLORY.

40:40.770 --> 40:42.499
- I DON'T KNOW, BINKY.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.065
I'VE BEEN THINKING
MAYBE IT'S TIME

40:45.110 --> 40:48.477
THIS OLD COWBOY
HUNG UP HIS SPURS.

40:48.510 --> 40:50.398
I GUESS I COULD TAKE COMFORT

40:50.440 --> 40:53.978
IN THE FACT THAT
I'VE LASTED THIS LONG.

40:54.010 --> 40:57.116
- WELL, AND THAT YOU'RE
ABOUT TO BE FILTHY RICH.

40:57.150 --> 40:59.141
- WELL, THAT TOO.

40:59.190 --> 41:00.748
- I'M GONNA MISS THIS PLACE.

41:00.790 --> 41:04.248
HANK, YOU BEEN
A DAMN GOOD FRIEND TO ME.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.952
YOU'VE BEEN
MORE THAN A FRIEND.

41:09.430 --> 41:10.454
- YEAH, THEM ARE HARD

41:10.500 --> 41:12.695
TO COME BY THESE DAYS.

41:12.730 --> 41:14.368
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,

41:14.400 --> 41:18.837
I GOT MYSELF
A WAYWARD AND WILD WOMAN

41:18.870 --> 41:20.667
TO ASK TO MARRY ME.

41:20.710 --> 41:22.473
- WHAT?
- [whistles]

41:27.150 --> 41:28.879
LOOK AT THAT.

41:28.920 --> 41:33.641
SHE'S ABOUT TO GIVE UP
THE WORLD'S OLDEST PROFESSION.

41:33.690 --> 41:35.385
- SHE WAS NEVER
A REAL MADAM, SHAWN.

41:35.420 --> 41:36.409
YOU DO KNOW THAT.

41:36.460 --> 41:40.055
- MM, AGREE TO DISAGREE.

41:40.090 --> 41:41.591
- BY THE WAY, SPENCER,

41:41.630 --> 41:43.120
YOU EVER CALL ME BINKY AGAIN,
I'LL SHOOT YOU.

41:43.160 --> 41:44.525
- UNDERSTOOD.

41:44.570 --> 41:47.061
HOW ABOUT ONCE MORE,
JUST FOR OLD TIMES' SAKE?

41:47.100 --> 41:49.261
- NOPE.
- OKAY.
