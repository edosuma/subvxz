00:29.379 --> 00:31.750
Some sucker will think he's getting beer,

00:32.000 --> 00:34.650
but he's really gonna get a face full of melon!

00:35.803 --> 00:37.203
Seedless melon!

00:39.600 --> 00:40.950
Don't ruin the moment.

00:43.218 --> 00:44.568
Oh, boy, free beer!

00:45.153 --> 00:46.403
Oh, man.

00:46.917 --> 00:49.017
Easy, Barney. Easy.

00:49.556 --> 00:51.606
Remember the 12 steps.

00:52.600 --> 00:53.829
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:54.079 --> 00:55.529
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.

00:59.401 --> 01:00.809
Nice try, boys.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.551
Now, as the roadrunner said
to the coyote, "meep meep"!

01:05.808 --> 01:07.365
Oh... everyone in town is wise to us.

01:07.618 --> 01:09.618
We need someone new we can prank.

01:16.753 --> 01:18.803
Sweet. Fresh meat.

01:19.117 --> 01:20.206
Meat's not sweet.

01:20.456 --> 01:22.050
It's savory.

01:22.300 --> 01:23.829
Hey, bean sprouts.

01:24.079 --> 01:26.950
The name's Howell Huser. I travel the country

01:27.200 --> 01:30.653
gawkin' and talkin', and I was
hopin' to take in your town.

01:30.903 --> 01:35.450
We can show you around if you don't
mind a heapin' helpin' of local color.

01:35.700 --> 01:37.750
Why my favorite color is local.

01:39.283 --> 01:40.203
Ooh! Watermelon.

01:40.453 --> 01:41.967
Want to plant the seeds?

01:42.217 --> 01:43.517
It's seedless.

01:46.956 --> 01:48.606
Radioactivity?

01:49.000 --> 01:51.000
That means it's a place where we do radio....

01:51.779 --> 01:52.829
activities.

01:57.603 --> 02:02.553
I'm happy to be exposed to that
kind of radioactivity.

02:03.700 --> 02:08.699
You know, the fish here are so friendly,
you can walk right up and feed them.

02:12.618 --> 02:14.218
Well, Howdy, little feller.

02:18.453 --> 02:20.503
I can't wait till this is over!

02:23.817 --> 02:27.517
I was thinking maybe we could
visit the hospital now?

02:27.956 --> 02:30.629
Perhaps a stick of gum will lighten your mood.

02:30.879 --> 02:33.229
It always has in the past.

02:36.300 --> 02:36.853
Finger pain?

02:37.103 --> 02:39.050
I thought I had gum comin'!

02:39.300 --> 02:47.068
That tears it! I've been smilin' for
47 years, and you two broke my streak!

02:47.318 --> 02:49.968
Shame on you, and shame on you.

02:50.253 --> 02:53.253
And shame on your whole ill-mannered town!

02:54.317 --> 02:56.106
Hey, that guy's shaming us.

02:56.356 --> 02:58.356
My self-esteem sure didn't need that!

03:00.400 --> 03:01.400
Loser!

03:04.879 --> 03:06.379
Get out, shamey.

03:07.300 --> 03:10.150
I don't think we'll be hearing from him again.

03:12.703 --> 03:16.050
So, Kitchen Wizard, I understand
you have a book coming out.

03:16.300 --> 03:19.300
Yes, it's about Winston Churchill's
life between the wars.

03:19.318 --> 03:21.103
Up next on the soft news network,

03:21.353 --> 03:26.403
let's hear from our own wide-eyed
wanderer Howell Huser.

03:26.917 --> 03:31.006
I've ambled and rambled across
this country, and never found

03:31.256 --> 03:34.256
a town I didn't like... till now,

03:34.557 --> 03:38.957
and the  name of that town,
is Springfield.

03:39.400 --> 03:43.550
I was attacked, humiliated, and fed misleading gum.

03:43.979 --> 03:47.650
I give Springfield the lowest
rating I've ever given a city--

03:47.900 --> 03:50.000
a six out of ten.

03:51.303 --> 03:54.003
I hope this bad publicity doesn't affect tourism.

03:54.600 --> 03:55.568
Who needs tourists?

03:55.818 --> 03:58.518
They never buy my maps to stars' homes, anyway.

04:04.953 --> 04:05.667
Have you read them all?

04:05.917 --> 04:06.667
Okay, good.

04:14.156 --> 04:16.850
We need to bring tourism back to Springfield.

04:17.100 --> 04:22.179
As usual, I will open the floor to all
crazy ideas that jump to people's minds.

04:22.379 --> 04:22.950
Stronger beer!

04:23.200 --> 04:23.953
Gladiator fights!

04:24.203 --> 04:24.850
Poetry slam!

04:25.100 --> 04:25.900
Giant rats!

04:27.118 --> 04:29.018
I have a real suggestion.

04:32.453 --> 04:34.667
Why don't we legalize same-sex marriage?

04:34.917 --> 04:37.447
We can attract a growing segment of the marriage market

04:37.697 --> 04:40.206
and strike a blow for civil rights.

04:40.456 --> 04:42.929
Yeah, them gay guys got lots of disposable income.

04:43.179 --> 04:47.450
I can serve fancy drinks and charge
ten bucks a pop. What's in a martini?

04:47.700 --> 04:49.253
Gin and vermouth.

04:49.503 --> 04:50.650
And that makes a what?

04:50.900 --> 04:51.968
A martini.

04:52.218 --> 04:55.503
Never heard of it, but I'm still in
favor of that same-sex marriage deal.

04:55.753 --> 04:56.367
Then it's settled.

04:56.617 --> 04:58.306
We'll legalize gay money--

04:58.556 --> 05:00.656
I mean, uh, gay marriage.

05:02.400 --> 05:04.929
I propose we also legalize gay funerals--

05:05.179 --> 05:06.479
starting with this guy.

05:06.900 --> 05:07.453
I'm not gay.

05:07.703 --> 05:09.203
I'm nothing yet!

05:09.900 --> 05:14.168
Okay, now let's say I put a lean cuisine
in a blender and I pour some beer on it.

05:14.418 --> 05:15.103
What do you call that?

05:15.353 --> 05:17.167
A lean cuisini?

05:17.417 --> 05:18.467
Wrong.

05:18.717 --> 05:21.506
When my man and I shop for wedding downs

05:21.756 --> 05:24.950
We were mocked and shunned and pushed around

05:25.200 --> 05:28.229
but yesterday, we found a place to be gay

05:28.479 --> 05:32.050
I'm  going to marry my Harry in Springfield town

05:32.200 --> 05:40.253
Gay-o, it's okay-o. Tie the knot and
spend all your dough gay-o,

05:40.503 --> 05:45.703
come stay-o visit our web site for further info.

05:45.900 --> 05:48.718
Springfield-- a place where everyone can marry.

05:49.018 --> 05:50.003
Even dudes.

05:50.253 --> 05:51.667
We're just off route 202.

05:51.917 --> 05:53.906
Do not take the Jefferson avenue exit.

05:54.156 --> 05:56.506
For god's sake, do not take that exit.

06:05.000 --> 06:09.329
while I have no opinion for or
against your sinful lifestyles,

06:09.779 --> 06:11.701
I cannot marry two people of the same sex

06:11.951 --> 06:15.950
anymore than I can put a hamburger on a hot dog bun.

06:16.700 --> 06:21.353
Now, go back to working behind the
scenes in every facet of entertainment!

06:21.703 --> 06:22.903
Excuse me, reverend.

06:23.400 --> 06:27.468
As long as two people love each other,
I don't think god cares

06:27.718 --> 06:30.368
whether they both have the same hoo-hoo or ha-ha.

06:31.453 --> 06:34.717
The bible forbids same-sex relations.

06:35.717 --> 06:36.906
Which book?

06:37.156 --> 06:38.456
Which book? The bible!

06:38.779 --> 06:40.050
But, reverend...

06:40.300 --> 06:43.100
scriptural scholars disagree
on the significance...

06:54.603 --> 06:55.650
Lovejoy's an idiot.

06:55.900 --> 06:58.468
His church is giving up hot gobs of gay green.

06:58.718 --> 07:01.768
He could get 200 bucks a couple.

07:02.253 --> 07:04.003
200 bucks a couple, eh?

07:09.117 --> 07:10.306
Hey, I got to get in on this!

07:10.556 --> 07:11.750
These people have rights!

07:12.000 --> 07:14.350
The right to buy me a 62-inch tv!

07:21.879 --> 07:27.350
Now begins the long and spiritual
journey to becoming an ordained minister.

07:27.600 --> 07:28.853
" Name."

07:29.103 --> 07:31.453
Ho-mer Simp-son.

07:31.900 --> 07:34.600
You are now an ordained minister.

07:39.518 --> 07:40.703
Now to answer all the pop-ups.

07:40.953 --> 07:43.367
Ooh, a talking moose wants
my credit card number.

07:43.617 --> 07:44.767
That's only fair.

08:02.156 --> 08:06.050
And  you, Julio, take thad to be
your lawful wedded life partner,

08:06.300 --> 08:09.829
in Massachusetts and Vermont, maybe Canada--

08:10.079 --> 08:11.050
Stay out of Texas--

08:11.300 --> 08:13.300
as long as you both are gay?

08:13.303 --> 08:14.650
I do.

08:14.900 --> 08:18.368
It brings me great joy to
unite two such loving people.

08:18.618 --> 08:21.118
Photo mouse pads for sale out back.

08:25.053 --> 08:27.967
Okay, what's next, Adam and Steve or Madam and Eve?

08:27.968 --> 08:30.006
Homie, you married every gay couple in town.

08:30.256 --> 08:31.450
Eh, what can I say?

08:31.700 --> 08:32.328
I love love.

08:32.578 --> 08:35.900
Well, all you can do now is wait
for some other guys to turn.

08:36.200 --> 08:37.753
Hmm, where's Lenny and Carl?

08:38.003 --> 08:39.049
Don't you push them!

08:39.299 --> 08:41.568
They've got to work that out for themselves.

08:41.818 --> 08:45.803
Oh! But I'm only $200 short of $14,800!

08:46.053 --> 08:49.167
Well, what about people of the
opposite sex who want to get married?

08:49.417 --> 08:51.117
Opposite? Yechh!

08:51.456 --> 08:53.506
I mean, a man and a woman.

08:54.071 --> 08:56.859
Well, maybe marriage isn't just for gays.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.451
What's that thing called when
a guy is gay for a girl?

08:59.708 --> 09:00.805
Straight.

09:01.500 --> 09:02.268
Ooh, look at me!

09:02.518 --> 09:04.518
I'm as straight as a one dollar bill.

09:17.253 --> 09:19.603
Do you, Cletus, take Brandine to be...

09:20.117 --> 09:22.506
wait a minute-- are you two brother and sister?

09:22.756 --> 09:24.856
We's all kinda things!

09:28.500 --> 09:30.829
A new epidemic is raging through Springfield,

09:31.079 --> 09:34.250
and this one didn't start with
krustyburger's whatchamacarcass sandwich.

09:34.500 --> 09:37.253
I'm talking about an outbreak of marriage fever.

09:37.503 --> 09:38.150
Reverend Simpson...

09:38.400 --> 09:40.768
Please, Kent, call me your Holiness.

09:41.018 --> 09:42.803
I-I can't. I just can't.

09:43.053 --> 09:45.967
Homer, have we started down a
slippery slope, where marriage becomes

09:46.217 --> 09:49.306
so meaningless that anyone could marry anything?

09:49.556 --> 09:52.856
Oh, Kent, not anything. It has to exist.

09:53.200 --> 09:54.829
Or does it?

09:55.079 --> 09:59.050
Well, call me old-fashioned, but I believe
that marriage described in the bible...

09:59.300 --> 10:01.253
if you love the bible so much, why don't you marry it?

10:01.503 --> 10:04.150
In fact, I now pronounce you and the bible man and wife.

10:04.400 --> 10:06.600
And you're the wife!

10:08.018 --> 10:09.103
Hey, you owe me 200 bucks.

10:09.453 --> 10:13.167
Homer, your impulsive marriages are
gonna lead to a lot of divorces.

10:13.417 --> 10:18.006
Which will lead to a lot more impulsive marriages,
which will put more green in the blue.

10:18.256 --> 10:20.306
The blue being my pants.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.829
I'm sorry, Homer, but I'm gonna have
to leave you hanging there.

10:25.079 --> 10:26.250
If I may say a word?

10:26.500 --> 10:29.453
Why, we're joined live now by Krusty the clown. Krusty?

10:29.703 --> 10:33.450
I want to clear up a misconception
about the whatchamacarcass sandwich.

10:33.700 --> 10:37.868
I used non-diseased meat from diseased animals.

10:38.118 --> 10:40.418
Everyone does it.

10:43.317 --> 10:45.006
Homie, I'm so proud of you.

10:45.256 --> 10:48.029
You stood up for people's right
to express love in

10:48.279 --> 10:52.279
its most perfect form, a binding legal contract.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.353
Hey, saturated fats, i came to ask you a favor.

10:58.603 --> 10:59.450
Let me get my belt sander.

10:59.700 --> 11:01.368
Maybe I can grind the ugly off your face.

11:01.618 --> 11:02.403
Very funny.

11:02.653 --> 11:04.603
I wasn't joking.

11:05.517 --> 11:07.867
I'm getting married, and I need
you to perform the ceremony.

11:08.356 --> 11:09.850
You're getting married?!

11:10.100 --> 11:11.829
Patty, that's wonderful!

11:12.079 --> 11:14.450
So, tell, tell, who's the lucky man?

11:14.700 --> 11:15.653
What does he do?

11:15.903 --> 11:17.350
Let me guess.

11:17.700 --> 11:19.168
Does he work in customer support?

11:19.418 --> 11:21.618
You can guess all night and never get it.

11:23.253 --> 11:24.867
Her name's Veronica.

11:25.117 --> 11:26.906
But Veronica's a girl's name.

11:27.156 --> 11:28.850
Did you know that?

11:29.100 --> 11:30.629
I'm marrying a woman.

11:31.079 --> 11:33.029
I'm... I'm gay.

11:35.300 --> 11:36.853
You're not disappointed, are you?

11:37.103 --> 11:38.750
Oh, no. No, no.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.350
No,  I'm just... surprised.

11:42.318 --> 11:43.903
Yeah, big surprise.

11:44.153 --> 11:46.267
Hey,  Marge, here's another bomb:

11:46.517 --> 11:48.567
I like beer.

11:50.756 --> 11:54.650
So Patty, you're a woman who likes women.

11:54.900 --> 11:57.750
I guess that fear I always had of you
stealing Homer away is unfounded.

12:00.079 --> 12:02.750
Marge, I'd be a lot more worried about me leaving you

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
for a sausage Patty than your sister Patty.

12:07.103 --> 12:09.050
Next time it'll be your eye.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.268
Marge, did you really think I was straight?

12:11.518 --> 12:13.818
Well, I guess I should have seen the signs.

12:14.853 --> 12:21.367
# Que sera, sera whatever will be will be

12:21.617 --> 12:25.306
# the future's not ours to see

12:25.556 --> 12:28.206
# que sera, sera

12:29.779 --> 12:31.800
# what will be will be.

12:32.100 --> 12:34.053
You could see it from space, Marge.

12:34.303 --> 12:36.750
This  isn't a problem for you, is it?

12:37.000 --> 12:38.068
Oh, no. No, no.

12:38.318 --> 12:39.203
Why would it be?

12:39.453 --> 12:43.567
I love you, I love gay marriage,
so I'd be a super-hypocrite

12:43.817 --> 12:46.306
if I didn't love your gay marriage, right?

12:46.556 --> 12:49.606
Now Patty, here's a veil
I picked out just for you.

12:52.500 --> 12:53.829
Smells like cheeseburgers.

12:54.079 --> 12:55.079
Give it back!

12:56.500 --> 13:00.053
Why are we dressed as sunday best
Simpsons for dinner with aunt Patty?

13:00.303 --> 13:04.650
Because she's bringing over someone very special.

13:04.900 --> 13:06.268
Her fiancée.

13:06.500 --> 13:08.968
Is this one of those
reality deals where a guy

13:09.218 --> 13:11.203
gets a million bucks for marrying aunt Patty,

13:10.953 --> 13:12.967
but they have to honeymoon in a box full of snakes?

13:13.217 --> 13:15.706
Son, that's the stupidest idea I ever heard.

13:15.956 --> 13:19.256
And I know exactly who would pay top dollar for it.

13:20.700 --> 13:21.829
You've reached FOX.

13:22.079 --> 13:24.750
If you're pitching a show where gold-digging skanks

13:25.000 --> 13:26.853
get what's coming to them, press one.

13:27.103 --> 13:31.150
If you're pitching a rip-off of another
network's reality show, press two.

13:31.400 --> 13:32.468
Please stay on the line.

13:32.718 --> 13:35.153
Your half-baked ideas are all we've got.

13:35.453 --> 13:39.903
Actually your aunt is marrying a very lucky...

13:41.117 --> 13:42.067
woman.

13:42.068 --> 13:44.550
I thought you said aunt Patty was
just waiting for the right man.

13:44.800 --> 13:48.329
As opposed to you, who grabbed
the first blimp that floated by.

13:48.579 --> 13:51.550
Correction. The first blimp who got her pregnant.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.253
Seriously dad, I'm worried.

13:53.503 --> 13:54.750
You should go on a diet.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.450
Why you little...

13:58.718 --> 13:59.718
save my place.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.953
This is my fiancée, Veronica.

14:09.217 --> 14:10.406
It's a pleasure to meet you all.

14:10.656 --> 14:12.929
So Veronica, what do you do?

14:13.279 --> 14:14.050
I'm a pro golfer.

14:14.300 --> 14:16.600
No surprises there.

14:17.003 --> 14:18.850
Aunt Patty, where did you two meet?

14:19.100 --> 14:20.168
Alternative book store?

14:20.418 --> 14:21.603
Ethiopian restaurant?

14:21.853 --> 14:23.667
It was so romantic--

14:23.917 --> 14:26.006
like a scene from a Hollywood movie.

14:26.256 --> 14:28.556
Yeah, Bride of the Monster.

14:30.800 --> 14:34.129
I was at the LPGA ritz bitz celebrity pro-am.

14:34.379 --> 14:35.550
Lady golfers?

14:35.800 --> 14:38.753
I thought we played this stupid
game to get away from the women.

14:39.003 --> 14:41.350
With the yak, yak, yak and the spend, spend, spend.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.150
Am I right?

14:44.018 --> 14:45.003
Hey, clown.

14:45.253 --> 14:47.503
Watch out for this lady driver.

14:51.017 --> 14:52.706
Are you all right?

14:52.956 --> 14:55.006
Never better.

15:00.700 --> 15:03.300
I'll bet that's how angels cough.

15:04.279 --> 15:07.179
I've been wearing that three wood ever since.

15:09.900 --> 15:11.753
Save something for your wedding night.

15:12.003 --> 15:15.003
Oh, we're saving everything
for our wedding night.

15:15.500 --> 15:16.968
That's what mom would want.

15:17.218 --> 15:19.703
I don't think it's exactly
what mom would want.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.367
Marge, are you sure you're okay with this?

15:22.617 --> 15:25.306
Of course. Everyone should do whatever they want.

15:25.556 --> 15:26.650
Take a bear to church.

15:26.900 --> 15:28.029
Read a book with your feet.

15:28.279 --> 15:30.550
Change your name to Gooble-Glop.

15:30.551 --> 15:31.653
Oh, I get it.

15:31.903 --> 15:37.953
You act all liberal, but you can't handle it when
your sister finds love in her own locker room.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.368
Marge, if you can find it in your heart

15:41.618 --> 15:43.303
to accept me for who I am,

15:43.553 --> 15:45.967
I would love to see you at the ceremony.

15:46.217 --> 15:49.217
If not, I'll see you at Homer's funeral.

15:52.079 --> 15:53.650
Which should be pretty soon.

15:53.900 --> 15:55.300
Got him!

15:59.403 --> 16:01.650
What am I not invited to this time?

16:01.900 --> 16:02.768
Gay wedding.

16:03.018 --> 16:04.003
But I can get you in.

16:04.253 --> 16:04.867
You can?

16:05.117 --> 16:06.106
Is there an open bar?

16:06.356 --> 16:06.950
No, cash.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.250
Well, I say this whole thing is against nature.

16:12.179 --> 16:14.250
So, wanna do a jigsaw puzzle tonight?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.853
Selma, I'm getting married in an hour.

16:17.103 --> 16:17.850
I know, I know.

16:18.100 --> 16:21.868
I'm just having trouble getting
used to the idea of being alone.

16:22.118 --> 16:23.303
Don't lay that on me.

16:23.553 --> 16:25.667
You got married three times.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.106
Actually, four.

16:27.356 --> 16:29.150
You see, last week...

16:29.400 --> 16:32.829
Disco Stu just got an annulment
from John Paul Two.

16:33.079 --> 16:34.429
Boogie down!

16:35.500 --> 16:38.453
Selma, we'll always be there for each other.

16:38.703 --> 16:40.450
I don't know about Marge, though.

16:40.700 --> 16:47.100
If she doesn't show up today,
I have no non-identical sister.

16:49.718 --> 16:52.703
Oh Lord, please help me say the
right words this afternoon,

16:52.953 --> 16:56.503
as I consecrate another gay
union that angers you so.

16:56.817 --> 16:59.806
And please let thy holy spirit
open the heart of my wife.

17:00.056 --> 17:00.650
Amen.

17:00.900 --> 17:03.929
I just can't believe my sister
would keep me in the dark

17:04.179 --> 17:07.179
all these years then expect complete
acceptance on the day she gets married.

17:12.700 --> 17:14.252
You handsome devil.

17:14.403 --> 17:16.450
Someday they'll let you and me get married.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.750
Can you imagine the children?

17:22.117 --> 17:23.718
I love you, Homer.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.203
I love you, too, Homer

17:37.779 --> 17:39.050
The toilet seat's up.

17:39.300 --> 17:41.650
But that wouldn't happen unless...

17:42.903 --> 17:47.903
Yeah, dude looks like a lady
dude looks like a lady

17:49.600 --> 17:51.850
She's a man.

17:52.518 --> 17:55.868
Looks like Patty's gonna get something
she didn't register for.

18:08.353 --> 18:12.967
Queerly beloved, we're here to join
Veronica and Patty in matrimony.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.906
But the news isn't all good.

18:15.156 --> 18:16.950
They've written their own vows.

18:17.200 --> 18:18.029
Patty?

18:18.279 --> 18:24.050
Veronica, in you I have found a soul mate.
You are the perfect woman for me--

18:24.300 --> 18:26.653
truthful, honest, hiding nothing.

18:26.903 --> 18:30.203
At last I have found the yin to my yin.

18:32.400 --> 18:35.068
If anyone knows a reason why
these two should not be joined,

18:35.318 --> 18:38.303
let them speak now or forever hold their peace.

18:38.553 --> 18:38.967
No!

18:39.217 --> 18:40.406
I can't let this happen!

18:40.656 --> 18:41.350
I knew it!

18:41.600 --> 18:45.729
You think everyone in the world
should have a big dumb man like you!

18:45.979 --> 18:47.450
People please, can we wrap this up?

18:47.700 --> 18:49.753
It's gonna rain and I gotta get the bikes in here.

18:50.003 --> 18:52.353
Patty, it's not what you think.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.450
Veronica is a man!

18:58.718 --> 19:01.703
Look at the size of that adam's apple!

19:01.953 --> 19:04.367
Veronica, how could you?

19:04.617 --> 19:08.306
Patty, I love you, but long
before we met, I disguised myself

19:08.556 --> 19:11.550
as a woman and lied my way onto the LPGA tour.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.429
I can see why you lied to other golfers, caddies, fans

19:14.679 --> 19:19.750
and officials, but how could you
lie to me and the sponsors?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.453
Because you fell in love with me as a woman,
and I didn't want to lose you.

19:23.703 --> 19:27.750
But now I'm asking you, not as
Veronica, but as the man I am--

19:28.000 --> 19:29.368
Leslie Robin Swisher.

19:29.618 --> 19:32.718
Patty, will you marry the real me?

19:37.353 --> 19:39.603
Hell no, I like girls!

19:45.917 --> 19:49.006
Marge, thank you for accepting me for who I am.

19:49.256 --> 19:50.429
Well, I learned a lesson.

19:50.679 --> 19:54.929
Just because you're a lesbian,
it doesn't make you less of a bein'.

19:56.600 --> 19:58.053
Patty, I admire your decision.

19:58.303 --> 20:00.150
It takes courage to follow your heart and

20:00.400 --> 20:02.668
walk out on a non-refundable wedding ceremony.

20:02.918 --> 20:08.803
So I'm gonna waive the rose petal removal
fee and prorate the cake-handling surcharge.

20:09.053 --> 20:10.503
Oh, thanks.

20:10.817 --> 20:13.306
Well, that's the end of dad's wedding business.

20:13.556 --> 20:14.750
Why?

20:15.000 --> 20:18.379
Hey, twisted sister, you still
have that jigsaw puzzle?

20:18.879 --> 20:20.750
There never was a jigsaw puzzle.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.253
I was trying to make you jealous.

20:22.503 --> 20:25.850
Hey, wanna go to the airport
and leave a bag unattended?

20:26.100 --> 20:28.568
It is a good way to meet security personnel.

20:28.818 --> 20:30.168
Let's go.

20:45.853 --> 20:46.367
Next.

20:46.617 --> 20:49.267
Hurry, before she changes her mind.
