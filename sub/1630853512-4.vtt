Wait.

35:30.302 --> 35:32.130
He went in there
to steal the pills...

35:33.653 --> 35:35.307
...because he was
working for you?

35:37.047 --> 35:39.702
Look, o-obviously we still have
some kinks to work out.

35:43.184 --> 35:45.752

You're good to go.

36:04.379 --> 36:06.033
I took the pills out of evidence
for you and put 'em in there.

36:07.339 --> 36:08.688
Figured you might need 'em
if you're gonna get in

36:08.731 --> 36:10.777
with the Task Champ guys.

36:12.039 --> 36:14.128
Look, Sarah told me
why you're doing this.

36:14.172 --> 36:15.695
To go after
the big guys.

a bunch of kids

36:24.486 --> 36:26.271
who had no choice.

36:27.837 --> 36:28.882
And to be honest
with you, dude...

themselves in any way.

a pill on him.

above the corner stall.

38:13.639 --> 38:14.988
I made sure it was open.

38:15.031 --> 38:16.685
And I checked the schedule.

38:16.729 --> 38:18.252
I made sure you have
a male guard,

38:18.296 --> 38:20.298
so he can't go in with you.

38:22.256 --> 38:23.605
