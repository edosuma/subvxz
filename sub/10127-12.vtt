NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
NEW SEASON STARTS TOMORROW.

00:54.033 --> 00:55.500
DON'T GET FAT
IN THE OFF-SEASON.

00:55.500 --> 00:56.700
I GOTTA HIT THE SHOWERS.

00:56.700 --> 00:57.767
WHOO!

00:57.767 --> 01:00.800
ALL RIGHT, DAD.
COME ON. LET'S GO.

01:00.800 --> 01:02.133
OH, NO, CORY.
NO. I'M WIPED.

01:02.133 --> 01:05.200
I PLAYED 2 HOURS
OF RACQUETBALL
WITH ERIC THIS MORNING.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.834
YOU WERE JUST GONNA
PLAY ERIC. COME ON.

01:06.834 --> 01:08.667
WELL, THAT WAS
FOR THE CHAMPIONSHIP.

01:08.667 --> 01:10.200
ALL RIGHT, FINE. THIS
WILL BE FOR OUR CHAMPIONSHIP.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.233

01:17.734 --> 01:19.700
WHAT? IF ERIC'S
NOT AROUND? COME ON.

01:19.700 --> 01:21.900
WHAT?

01:21.900 --> 01:24.834
NEVER MIND, DAD.
GIVE ME THE BALL.

01:24.834 --> 01:26.233
WHAT? SO YOU CAN
THROW IT AT ME AGAIN?

01:26.233 --> 01:27.233
FORGET IT.

01:27.233 --> 01:28.400
KNOCK IT OFF.

01:28.400 --> 01:29.600
GIVE ME THE--
JUST GIVE ME
THE BALL.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.100
AH!

01:31.100 --> 01:34.900
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

01:34.900 --> 01:36.934
DAD, I'M--

01:36.934 --> 01:38.734
ALAN, WHAT HAPPENED?

01:40.800 --> 01:42.400
ASK YOUR SON.

01:45.934 --> 01:48.900
I SWEAR.
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.000
COR?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.133
I JUST WANTED TO PLAY.

02:01.667 --> 02:03.233
AAH! OH! OH!

02:05.767 --> 02:07.300
OH, YEAH.

02:07.300 --> 02:10.033
HEY, THE SUPER
TOLD ME TO TELL YOU

02:10.033 --> 02:12.200
THAT THE PEOPLE ABOVE US
LET THEIR BATHTUB OVERFLOW,

02:12.200 --> 02:13.500
AND WHATEVER
YOU DO, DON'T...

02:13.500 --> 02:16.734
POKE AT THE BIG BUBBLE
ON MY CEILING?

02:16.734 --> 02:19.100
YEAH. YOU GOT THE MESSAGE?

02:19.100 --> 02:20.200
YEAH. JUST NOW.

02:20.200 --> 02:21.900
MY WHOLE ROOM'S FLOODED,
AND THERE'S

02:21.900 --> 02:24.600
A HALF A BATHTUB
HANGING OVER MY BED.

02:24.600 --> 02:27.100
SO STAY IN MY ROOM.

02:29.767 --> 02:31.900
SO WHEN PEOPLE THROW
GARBAGE DOWN THE CHUTE,

02:31.900 --> 02:33.200
THIS IS WHERE
IT WINDS UP, HUH?

02:33.200 --> 02:35.567
ARE YOU
CALLING ME A PIG?

02:35.567 --> 02:37.700
A PIG WOULD
NEVER LIVE IN HERE.

02:37.700 --> 02:39.000
OH, YEAH?

02:46.600 --> 02:48.567
I'M SLEEPING OUT
ON THE COUCH, MAN.

02:48.567 --> 02:50.367
SHAWN, I NEED TO SLEEP
ON YOUR COUCH.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.400
I GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH MY DAD.

02:52.400 --> 02:53.667
EVERYBODY
GETS INTO A FIGHT
WITH THEIR DAD.

02:53.667 --> 02:54.967
YEAH. I KNOCKED HIM DOWN.

02:54.967 --> 02:57.900
THAT'S NOT
QUITE AS COMMON.

02:57.900 --> 03:00.133
I WANTED TO PLAY
BASKETBALL WITH HIM,

03:00.133 --> 03:01.867
LIKE HE DOES WITH ERIC.

03:01.867 --> 03:04.033
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU HIT YOUR DAD.

03:04.033 --> 03:05.934
NOW, DOES HE HAVE TO
LEAVE THE HOUSE IN SHAME?

03:05.934 --> 03:07.600
DO YOU GET HIS WOMAN?

03:07.600 --> 03:09.400
WELL, I DIDN'T
ACTUALLY HIT HIM.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.800
I SHOVED HIM,
AND HE WENT DOWN.

03:11.800 --> 03:13.500
HE DOES ALL THESE THINGS
WITH ERIC.

03:13.500 --> 03:15.133
WHY WON'T HE DO THINGS
WITH ME?

03:15.133 --> 03:17.200
WELL, HE'S AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA HIT HIM AGAIN.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.200
ERIC HAS A GOOD
RELATIONSHIP WITH HIM,
YOU KNOW THAT?

03:19.200 --> 03:20.600
THEY SKI TOGETHER.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.033
THEY GO CAMPING
TOGETHER.

03:22.033 --> 03:24.934
I EVEN HEARD THEM
PLANNING ON JUMPING OUT
OF A PLANE TOGETHER.

03:24.934 --> 03:26.600
ALL WE DO IS TALK.

03:26.600 --> 03:28.300
CORY, YOU HAVE
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR DAD.

03:28.300 --> 03:30.000
I'M NOT
GONNA GO THROUGH
THE REST OF MY LIFE

03:30.000 --> 03:31.400
AS THE GUY
MY FATHER TALKED TO.

03:31.400 --> 03:35.600
GREAT CONVERSATIONS
ARE NOT MEMORIES
YOU LOOK BACK ON.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.967
YOU HAVE TONS OF MEMORIES
WITH YOUR DAD.

03:37.967 --> 03:38.800
LIKE WHAT?

03:38.800 --> 03:41.834
LIKE THE TIME
YOU BEAT HIM UP.

03:41.834 --> 03:43.867
YOU'RE GONNA TALK
ABOUT THAT FOR YEARS.

03:51.600 --> 03:52.767
GEORGE...

03:52.767 --> 03:55.700
IT'S 2:00 IN THE MORNING.

03:55.700 --> 03:57.000
IS EVERYTHING OK?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.967
NO, ALAN.
EVERYTHING'S NOT OK.

03:58.967 --> 04:01.500
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THIS AFTERNOON

04:01.500 --> 04:02.934
BETWEEN YOU AND CORY.

04:02.934 --> 04:05.000
YEAH?

04:05.000 --> 04:07.367
I'VE WAITED FOR YOU.
I'VE WAITED FOR CORY.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.467
NOTHING.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.967
NOBODY CAME OVER.

04:10.967 --> 04:12.934
SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS,

04:12.934 --> 04:16.467
SOMEBODY
SHOULD COME OVER.

04:16.467 --> 04:20.133
I MEAN, HE KNOCKED YOU
ON YOUR KEISTER, MAN.

04:20.133 --> 04:21.900
YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY UPSET,

04:21.900 --> 04:24.767
SO, PLEASE,
CAN WE TALK ABOUT IT
SO I CAN GET SOME SLEEP?

04:24.767 --> 04:25.867
YOU WANT TO COME IN,
GEORGE?

04:25.867 --> 04:27.100
WELL, YES.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.700
I'M MAKIN'
A LITTLE SNACK.

04:28.700 --> 04:29.667
HELP YOURSELF.

04:29.667 --> 04:31.600
DON'T MIND IF I DO.

04:31.600 --> 04:33.600
YOU KNOW, GEORGE,
I MEAN, IT'S ONE THING

04:33.600 --> 04:34.900
FOR THE BOYS TO ASK
FOR YOUR HELP,

04:34.900 --> 04:36.700
BUT I AM A CAPABLE ADULT.

04:36.700 --> 04:38.834
I CAN HANDLE THIS
ON MY OWN.

04:38.834 --> 04:41.200
YOU ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT,

04:41.200 --> 04:45.300
AND I AM SORRY
THAT I INTRUDED
ON YOUR PRIVACY.

04:45.300 --> 04:46.900
HE PUSHED ME DOWN,
GEORGE.

04:46.900 --> 04:50.934
MY OWN SON
PUSHED ME DOWN.

04:50.934 --> 04:53.000
DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE CORY.

04:53.000 --> 04:54.200
NO, IT DOESN'T.

04:54.200 --> 04:56.734
I MEAN,
HE KNOWS IF ANYTHING
IS BOTHERING HIM,

04:56.734 --> 04:58.500
HE CAN COME
AND TALK TO ME.

04:58.500 --> 05:02.100
I MEAN,
TALKING IS THE BASIS
OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

05:02.100 --> 05:05.500
MAYBE THAT'S
WHAT'S BOTHERING HIM.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.100
YOU NEVER STOP TEACHING,
DO YOU, GEORGE?

05:11.100 --> 05:14.000
NEXT TIME,
DON'T KEEP ME UP
ALL NIGHT, HMM?

05:29.200 --> 05:30.800
ARE YOU INSANE?

05:30.800 --> 05:33.100
WHAT? WHO SLEEPS
WITH THE LIGHT ON?

05:33.100 --> 05:34.600
ME, OK?
WHEN I WAS A KID,

05:34.600 --> 05:36.967
OUR TRAILER PARK WAS
RIGHT NEXT TO AN OFF RAMP.

05:36.967 --> 05:39.600
ALL NIGHT LONG,
TRUCK HEADLIGHTS
SHONE THROUGH THE WINDOW.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.033
THE LIGHT COMFORTS ME.

05:41.033 --> 05:44.567
YOU KNOW,
WHEN THE TEAMSTERS
WENT ON STRIKE IN '82,

05:44.567 --> 05:47.934
I DIDN'T SLEEP TILL
THERE WAS A SETTLEMENT.

05:47.934 --> 05:49.200
THAT'S A REALLY
LOVELY STORY.

05:49.200 --> 05:50.700
IT'D MAKE A GREAT
CHILDREN'S BOOK.

05:50.700 --> 05:52.467
HERE'S ANOTHER
GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOK:

05:52.467 --> 05:54.934
<i>GOOD NIGHT, LIGHT. </i>

05:54.934 --> 05:57.767
GOOD NIGHT, SHAWN.
GOOD NIGHT, PIG.

05:57.767 --> 06:00.200
HEY! HEY, JACK,
YOU'RE A GUEST IN MY ROOM.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.133
WHY DON'T YOU START
BEHAVING LIKE ONE?

06:02.133 --> 06:05.200
THE PIG HAS A NAME.
IT'S LITTLE CORY.

06:07.300 --> 06:08.400
FINE.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.100
GOOD NIGHT,
LITTLE CORY.

06:10.100 --> 06:11.600
GOOD NIGHT, PIG.

06:12.934 --> 06:14.100
GOOD NIGHT.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.033
<i>[CRICKETS CHIRPING] </i>

06:19.734 --> 06:21.600
CRICKETS?

06:21.600 --> 06:24.600
IT'S A TAPE: <i>SOUNDS </i>
<i>OF THE TRAILER PARK. </i>

06:24.600 --> 06:26.867
IT HELPS ME SLEEP.

06:28.500 --> 06:30.300
IT'S ACTUALLY
KIND OF SOOTHING.

06:33.233 --> 06:34.567
<i>[HORN BLASTS, </i>
<i>TRUCK PASSES] </i>

06:34.567 --> 06:37.800

06:39.600 --> 06:41.934

06:41.934 --> 06:43.767
<i>[GUNSHOT] </i>

06:46.967 --> 06:48.934

GET UP. GET UP.

06:51.400 --> 06:52.867
HEY!

06:52.867 --> 06:54.133
HEY.

06:54.133 --> 06:55.500
GOD, I WOULDN'T HAVE
ASKED YOU TO STAY HERE

06:55.500 --> 06:58.700
IF I KNEW YOU WERE
GONNA BE SO WEIRD.

06:58.700 --> 07:01.500
OH! OH! I'M WEIRD?

07:01.500 --> 07:03.100
YOU KNOW WHAT
PUTS ME TO SLEEP?

07:03.100 --> 07:04.400
A GLASS OF MILK,

07:04.400 --> 07:06.467
NOT THE TRUCK THAT
DELIVERS THE MILK,

07:06.467 --> 07:08.100
BUT YOU'LL
HAVE TO EXCUSE ME.

07:08.100 --> 07:09.834
I WAS RAISED
IN AN ACTUAL HOUSE.

07:12.133 --> 07:13.900
OH...

07:13.900 --> 07:15.200
I SEE.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.934
WELL, AS LONG
AS YOU PUT IT THAT WAY,

07:16.934 --> 07:19.500
I WOULD BE HAPPY
TO TURN OUT YOUR LIGHTS.

07:19.500 --> 07:20.900
OH! OH,
I WOULDN'T, MAN.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.200
PIEDMONT PREP

07:23.200 --> 07:24.867
COME ON. LET'S GO.

07:24.867 --> 07:28.600
YOU KNOW, IF I REALLY
WANTED TO HIT YOU,
I WOULD HAVE.

07:28.600 --> 07:31.033
WELL, WHEN YOU WANT TO,
I'LL BE RIGHT HERE,

07:31.033 --> 07:33.200
ASLEEP IN THE DARK...

07:33.200 --> 07:36.133
LIKE NORMAL PEOPLE.

07:44.467 --> 07:45.467
CORY.

07:45.467 --> 07:46.500
CORY.

07:46.500 --> 07:47.467
WHAT?

07:47.467 --> 07:48.467
CORY, GET UP.

07:48.467 --> 07:49.600
NO. I DON'T
WANT TO GET UP.

07:49.600 --> 07:51.000
I HIT MY FATHER.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.500
THAT'S GOTTA
BE A BAD SIN.

07:52.500 --> 07:56.200
IF THIS WERE THE BIBLE,
I'D BE A FATHER SMITER.

07:56.200 --> 08:00.467
I'D BE CORY,
SON OF ALAN THE BRUISED.

08:00.467 --> 08:02.967
CORY, YOU'VE GOT
A GREAT RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR FATHER.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.100
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

08:04.100 --> 08:05.500
IF THEY FIND YOU HERE
WITH ME,

08:05.500 --> 08:07.100
THEY'LL STONE YOU.

08:07.100 --> 08:08.900
SAVE YOURSELF, TOPANGA,

08:08.900 --> 08:11.200
DAUGHTER OF MIRIAM.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.800
CORY, GO HOME AND
TALK THIS OUT WITH HIM.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.500
NO. THAT'S
THE WHOLE POINT,
TOPANGA.

08:15.500 --> 08:16.834
ALL WE DO IS TALK.

08:16.834 --> 08:19.500
YOU KNOW, THAT'S
ALL OUR RELATIONSHIP IS.

08:19.500 --> 08:21.033
THAT'S NOT
LIKE HIM AND ERIC.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.300
THEY DO STUFF TOGETHER.

08:22.300 --> 08:23.867
I WANNA DO STUFF, TOO.

08:23.867 --> 08:26.000
I NEVER WANT
TO TALK TO HIM AGAIN!

08:26.000 --> 08:28.133
YOU'RE COMIN' WITH US.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.000
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS?

08:33.400 --> 08:34.667
[SHOUTING] OK!

08:34.667 --> 08:37.200
YOU'VE SUCCESSFULLY
COMPLETED
THE GROUND COURSE!

08:37.200 --> 08:38.934
WELCOME
TO YOUR FIRST JUMP!

08:38.934 --> 08:40.467
OOH!

08:40.467 --> 08:42.300
[INSTRUCTOR
LAUGHS] YEAH?!

08:42.300 --> 08:45.000
[SHOUTING] I--ACTUALLY,
I WASN'T PAYING ATTENTION

08:45.000 --> 08:46.734
ON THE--ON THE GROUND,

08:46.734 --> 08:49.734
AND I FEEL I SHOULDN'T
BE ALLOWED UP HERE!

08:49.734 --> 08:51.767
YOU KNOW
WHAT I LOVE?
IT'S THE DRAMA!

08:51.767 --> 08:54.467
YOU KNOW, LIKE,
WILL THE CHUTE OPEN
OR WILL IT NOT?!

08:54.467 --> 08:56.500
THIS ISN'T FAIR!

08:56.500 --> 09:00.500
WHEN YOU HIT THE GROUND,
YOU WERE NOT 10,000 FEET
ABOVE IT!

09:00.500 --> 09:01.834
[SHOUTING] NOW, CORY,
THIS IS SOMETHING

09:01.834 --> 09:03.934
ERIC AND I HAVE BEEN
TALKING ABOUT DOING.

09:03.934 --> 09:06.033
THERE'S NO REASON YOU
SHOULDN'T BE A PART OF IT!

09:06.033 --> 09:08.567
SO THIS
ISN'T BECAUSE I
PUSHED YOU DOWN?

09:08.567 --> 09:10.600
WELL, YES, IT IS BECAUSE
YOU PUSHED ME DOWN.

09:10.600 --> 09:12.834
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU'RE THAT UPSET

18:46.000 --> 18:48.900
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ARTIST
IS TRYING TO SAY, ERIC?

18:55.100 --> 18:56.800
IT'S ABSTRACT.

18:56.800 --> 19:00.133
IT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS.
THERE'S NO RIGHT OR WRONG.

19:00.133 --> 19:01.834
A MONKEY.

19:04.400 --> 19:05.500
2 MONKEYS,

19:05.500 --> 19:08.367
AND THEY'RE FIGHTING
OVER A COCONUT,

19:08.367 --> 19:11.700
WHICH SYMBOLIZES
THE FATHER MONKEY'S
ATTENTION.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.367
UH, THIS MAY NOT
HAVE BEEN A GOOD IDEA.

19:16.367 --> 19:19.867
WELL, DAD, IT IS OPEN
TO INTERPRETATION,
YOU KNOW?

19:19.867 --> 19:22.100
MY INTERPRETATION
IS THAT THE ARTIST

19:22.100 --> 19:25.100
IS ILLUSTRATING
A VERY PAINFUL SITUATION,

19:25.100 --> 19:29.000
WHERE THE FATHER MONKEY
HAS 2 SONS,
BUT ONLY ONE COCONUT,

19:29.000 --> 19:31.900
SO HE--HE SPLITS
THE COCONUT IN HALF,

19:31.900 --> 19:35.700
BUT ONLY A HALF A COCONUT
ISN'T ENOUGH
FOR EITHER SON.

19:39.200 --> 19:40.400
UH-HUH.

19:42.400 --> 19:45.467
AHEM. SO, WHAT KIND OF ART
YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT NOW?

19:45.467 --> 19:47.834
NEOCLASSICISM?
IMPRESSIONISM?

19:47.834 --> 19:49.300
UM...PHOTOGRAPHIC ART?

19:49.300 --> 19:51.600
ANSEL ADAMS,
AMERICAN LANDSCAPE?

19:51.600 --> 19:52.967
HE'S PROBABLY
MY FAVORITE,

19:52.967 --> 19:54.867
BUT YOU
DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

19:57.033 --> 19:58.967
UH, NO, I--

19:58.967 --> 20:00.500
I DIDN'T.

20:02.033 --> 20:04.367
HOW DO YOU KNOW
ABOUT ALL THIS?

20:04.367 --> 20:06.133
I LEARNED ABOUT IT
AT SCHOOL.

20:06.133 --> 20:09.400
WE JUST, YOU KNOW,
NEVER TALKED ABOUT IT.

20:09.400 --> 20:12.033
DIDN'T THINK YOU'D
WANT TO HEAR IT FROM ME.

20:14.000 --> 20:16.233
I JUST ALWAYS
TRIED TO BE THE PERSON

20:16.233 --> 20:19.200
I THOUGHT
YOU WANTED ME TO BE.

20:25.000 --> 20:26.867
UM...

20:26.867 --> 20:29.000
YOU KNOW, UM...

20:29.000 --> 20:33.000
I'D REALLY LOVE TO HEAR
WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY
ABOUT THIS PIECE.

20:33.000 --> 20:36.967
I WOULD LOVE TO TELL YOU.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.000
WHAT YOU DOIN', DAD?

21:03.000 --> 21:05.000
OH, TAKING DOWN
THIS HOOP.

21:05.000 --> 21:08.967
NO GOOD
CAN COME FROM IT.

21:08.967 --> 21:10.400
HEY, MORGAN.

21:10.400 --> 21:11.767
UH...

21:11.767 --> 21:14.867
WE HAVE A PRETTY GOOD
RELATIONSHIP, RIGHT?

21:14.867 --> 21:16.400
WELL, I GUESS SO.

21:16.400 --> 21:19.000
YEAH. WE TALK, RIGHT?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.233
YEAH.

21:20.233 --> 21:22.500
AND WE HAVE FUN, RIGHT?

21:22.500 --> 21:24.133
YEAH.

21:25.600 --> 21:27.600
I SHOULDA HAD ALL GIRLS.
