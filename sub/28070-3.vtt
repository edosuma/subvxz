00:06.325 --> 00:09.365
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:23.405 --> 02:24.845
Where is everyone?

02:24.925 --> 02:28.045
They left, Aureliano.
Eight of them came while you were gone.

02:28.125 --> 02:30.005
The Gravonis and the other family bosses.

02:30.485 --> 02:33.525
I was on my own. I had to tell them
where the weapons were.

02:33.605 --> 02:34.685
They took them all.

02:43.165 --> 02:45.445
All right, let's go get our stuff back.
Come on.

02:56.925 --> 02:59.605
I'm sorry. About Livia. About everything.

02:59.685 --> 03:01.285
But this time I'm not coming.

03:02.645 --> 03:03.965
Look around you.

03:04.045 --> 03:05.685
Nothing more can be done here.

03:06.805 --> 03:08.365
You're the last Adami left.

03:08.765 --> 03:10.405
Watch out you don't get shot.

03:34.485 --> 03:36.565
You're putting me on the spot here...

03:36.645 --> 03:39.845
But if you really want to know,
I'm a proud AS Roma supporter.

03:39.925 --> 03:42.965
Oh! Obviously we're pleased to hear that!

03:43.045 --> 03:46.165
-Have you ever played soccer?
-Well, I played as a kid.

03:46.245 --> 03:48.485
And where did you prefer to play?
What position?

03:48.805 --> 03:50.125
Right wing.

03:50.205 --> 03:52.605
I never had much technique,
but I could run.

03:52.685 --> 03:55.125
Ah, then politically speaking,
we could say

03:55.205 --> 03:58.325
you're coming back to play
in your old position?

03:58.405 --> 03:59.405
On the Right.

03:59.485 --> 04:03.365
You've got this hoard of votes
that should go to the Left.

04:03.445 --> 04:05.965
However, this declaration of love
for the Left hasn't arrived.

04:06.045 --> 04:07.045
That's true.

04:07.125 --> 04:09.925
But it's because my old political party
has fallen behind on many issues

04:10.005 --> 04:11.325
that were previously ours:

04:11.405 --> 04:13.925
the outer boroughs,
the safety of citizens...

04:14.005 --> 04:17.325
It's very simple. I'm with whoever has
Rome's best interests at heart.

04:17.405 --> 04:18.965
Yes, and on that subject,

04:19.045 --> 04:22.325
can you explain what's happening
in our city with this migrant problem?

04:22.404 --> 04:24.165
Well, they've managed to transfer

04:24.245 --> 04:26.645
hundreds of migrants
into the heart of Ostia.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.165
In fact, it seems there are 500 migrants.

04:29.245 --> 04:31.245
It's a veritable invasion!

04:31.325 --> 04:33.365
More than that,
we're also talking about land

04:33.445 --> 04:35.765
that many important interests
have been after lately.

04:35.845 --> 04:38.845
Yes, yes, and in addition to this,
and what's worse in my view,

04:38.925 --> 04:43.325
is that something like this cannot happen
in secret, without informing the citizens.

04:43.405 --> 04:44.805
-Right.
-It's unacceptable.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.885
Right.
In fact, now the citizens have rebelled.

04:47.965 --> 04:49.965
Okay, Mr. Cinaglia, thank you very much.

04:50.045 --> 04:52.005
-Thank you for your time.
-Thank you.

04:52.085 --> 04:53.925
Thank you for this very interesting chat.

04:54.005 --> 04:56.085
Now we're going for a short break

04:56.165 --> 04:58.765
and then we'll be back
to talk about our beloved team.

04:58.845 --> 04:59.845
Stay tuned.

05:05.285 --> 05:08.365
If you don't do something soon,
it'll lose the hoof.

05:08.445 --> 05:09.805
Do you know about horses now, too?

05:09.885 --> 05:11.525
Horses, dogs,

05:11.605 --> 05:13.645
sheep, people...

05:13.725 --> 05:15.365
Whatever makes money.

05:15.965 --> 05:17.365
All right, thanks.

05:18.845 --> 05:21.645
-What are you doing here?
-Collecting.

05:22.165 --> 05:23.125
You got Livia.

05:23.205 --> 05:25.085
All the dealing in Ostia, huh?

05:25.165 --> 05:26.605
And no problems.

05:27.685 --> 05:29.245
Ostia's bigger than Venice.

05:30.085 --> 05:34.445
Have you got the capital to invest?
If not, the problems start right away.

05:44.205 --> 05:45.325
This is it?

05:45.885 --> 05:48.445
It's enough to grease a few palms
and cover the first few months.

05:48.525 --> 05:51.045
-Maybe.
-How much are we talking about to be okay?

05:51.125 --> 05:52.965
At least triple that.

05:53.605 --> 05:56.165
-We'll find the money.
-Fine, first find it.

05:56.245 --> 05:57.525
And then we'll talk.

05:57.605 --> 05:59.885
I heard what happened with the Adamis.

06:01.605 --> 06:05.445
-How are you going to handle him now?
-The Adamis aren't my problem anymore.

06:09.685 --> 06:12.045
Hey, I heard you on the radio.
You were really good.

06:12.125 --> 06:13.325
-Really?
-Yes.

06:13.405 --> 06:15.525
Now they'll have understood
what you want to do.

06:17.285 --> 06:19.405
-You've spoken to the Right, haven't you?
-No.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.965
They're the ones that have to call me.
I've said what I had to say.

06:23.045 --> 06:26.525
They clearly don't have your cell number,
because they've already called here twice.

06:27.405 --> 06:28.365
Who?

06:28.445 --> 06:30.925
Hello? Yes, he just came in.

06:31.685 --> 06:34.325
-Of course, I'll put him on the phone.
-And this is the third.

06:34.405 --> 06:38.045
Yes, certainly.
Enrico Barzacci of the Center-Right.

06:39.445 --> 06:40.525
Yes?

07:10.725 --> 07:12.365
Samurai took everything I had.

07:16.085 --> 07:17.485
I've got nothing left.

07:20.485 --> 07:22.645
I want to kill him, Spadino.

07:24.085 --> 07:25.805
I want to kill him with my own hands.

07:27.525 --> 07:29.325
Spadino told me what you did.

07:29.405 --> 07:31.325
-I did what I could.
-I know.

07:38.005 --> 07:39.485
Everyone has left me.

07:40.285 --> 07:42.125
But you're still here.

07:43.445 --> 07:46.765
Before, the problem was my father,
your father, your brother...

07:47.885 --> 07:50.325
Now they're gone
and we've still got a problem.

07:50.405 --> 07:52.405
As long as Samurai's around we're fucked.

07:52.485 --> 07:54.485
Right. We have to take everything.

07:55.205 --> 07:57.565
It's time for this city to change hands.

07:57.885 --> 08:00.125
I knew I was an idiot
to get back with you two.

08:01.725 --> 08:03.005
All right.

08:03.085 --> 08:04.565
When are we going to do it?

08:05.685 --> 08:06.685
Today.

08:09.245 --> 08:10.245
Today.

08:13.685 --> 08:14.685
Today.

08:23.085 --> 08:24.605
What am I supposed to do with this?

08:26.045 --> 08:28.005
The Adami land is now ours.

08:28.325 --> 08:29.405
Yes.

08:29.485 --> 08:31.685
But there are hundreds of refugees camped

08:31.765 --> 08:33.765
on the land that
you bought from the Vatican.

08:33.845 --> 08:36.245
And to build the port we need both lots.

08:36.325 --> 08:38.525
Those starving refugees aren't
the problem, though.

08:38.804 --> 08:39.965
No.

08:40.044 --> 08:41.885
I'll tell you what the problem is.

08:41.965 --> 08:43.924
Soon there'll be a new city council,

08:44.005 --> 08:45.765
and on those lands

08:45.845 --> 08:47.845
we still haven't built a thing.

08:47.924 --> 08:50.125
Not a house, not a lamp-post, nothing!

08:50.205 --> 08:52.165
If someone at city hall wakes up
and decides

08:52.245 --> 08:54.405
we can't so much as drive a nail there,
what do we do?

08:54.485 --> 08:56.125
We control the politicians.

08:56.765 --> 08:58.085
Are you sure of that?

09:00.205 --> 09:03.085
I've got to start
making money on those lands.

09:04.045 --> 09:05.485
As things stand now,

09:05.565 --> 09:07.285
I only trust concrete.

09:19.445 --> 09:20.685
Cristiana?

09:25.605 --> 09:27.765
The Adami house report, is it ready?

09:28.365 --> 09:30.925
-Almost, I'm working on it.
-Can you get it finished by tonight?

09:31.005 --> 09:32.285
Yes.

09:32.365 --> 09:33.405
Good. Thank you.

09:33.885 --> 09:34.925
Lele.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.085
That source you told me about,
is he trustworthy?

09:40.165 --> 09:41.845
Of course he is.

09:41.925 --> 09:43.765
He was my father's, I told you.

09:44.565 --> 09:46.725
-Why?
-I'm just curious.

09:48.005 --> 09:50.845
-Hey, don't write anything about that.
-No, no, I know.

09:50.925 --> 09:53.165
As soon as you're finished,
put it on my desk.

10:20.485 --> 10:21.565
Get out!

10:21.645 --> 10:23.085
You have to go!

10:23.165 --> 10:24.685
We don't want you here!

10:24.765 --> 10:26.045
Get out!

10:31.245 --> 10:32.805
Get out!

10:36.365 --> 10:37.845
Mrs. Monaschi!

10:38.925 --> 10:40.125
Ma'am!

10:51.045 --> 10:52.325
Good morning.

10:52.405 --> 10:56.165
I see you've gotten out of real estate
and into the charity business.

10:56.245 --> 10:59.285
I'm here
because all of these people need help.

10:59.365 --> 11:01.125
And who are you doing business with?

11:01.205 --> 11:04.205
-I'm not a businessman, I'm a politician.
-Sure.

11:04.285 --> 11:06.845
So you came here to figure out
how to throw them back into the sea.

11:08.045 --> 11:09.845
These people don't bother me at all.

11:09.925 --> 11:12.445
Ah, I would never have guessed.

11:12.525 --> 11:14.805
At least going by
what you've been saying publicly.

11:17.445 --> 11:18.845
Do you hear these people?

11:19.645 --> 11:22.165
Lots of people are pissed off like them.

11:22.245 --> 11:23.485
They're my voters.

11:24.045 --> 11:27.365
-I'm here to listen to them.
-A nice way of doing politics.

11:28.205 --> 11:30.245
I recall you being different, though.

11:30.925 --> 11:33.525
Anyway, I've decided to stay
on the side of the most needy.

11:33.605 --> 11:35.765
And how much are
the most needy worth, ma'am?

11:36.365 --> 11:38.805
-What do you want, Cinaglia?
-I don't want anything.

11:38.885 --> 11:40.885
I told you, I'm here as a politician.

11:40.965 --> 11:43.525
If you're refugees stay here,
that's absolutely fine by me.

11:43.605 --> 11:45.685
For me, they're worth more
than a thousand TV ads.

11:46.365 --> 11:47.365
Congratulations!

11:48.325 --> 11:51.485
I see you've really figured out
how to get ahead in this city:

11:52.365 --> 11:53.885
say one thing and do another.

11:53.965 --> 11:55.765
Then it seems we have something in common.

11:58.405 --> 11:59.725
I'm going back to work.

12:00.765 --> 12:01.765
Take care.

12:02.925 --> 12:05.285
Free Ostia!

12:15.645 --> 12:16.965
Eleonora?

12:17.045 --> 12:18.045
Yes, Sara?

12:18.845 --> 12:20.925
So, we're short ten beds

12:21.005 --> 12:22.365
and about 60 blankets.

12:22.445 --> 12:24.285
Yes, they should have arrived
this morning.

12:24.365 --> 12:27.365
-Then call them.
-I'll call them again and let you know.

12:27.445 --> 12:29.445
-Ask for more than 60.
-Okay.

12:30.245 --> 12:31.805
What is this circus?

12:31.885 --> 12:34.365
-An emergency assistance operation.
-Are these your people?

12:34.445 --> 12:36.605
-No, I only run the camp.
-They have to disappear!

12:36.685 --> 12:38.565
-Today!
-I don't make the decisions.

12:38.645 --> 12:40.085
The police and the authorities do.

12:40.565 --> 12:43.965
-The Vatican made this land available.
-This is my land.

12:44.045 --> 12:45.525
Get rid of them, understand?

12:45.605 --> 12:48.725
-It's only a temporary solution.
-You're a very enterprising woman.

12:48.805 --> 12:51.885
And you're even quite attractive,
but you get easily distracted.

12:52.645 --> 12:55.245
You should remember
that I don't just make threats!

13:11.805 --> 13:12.805
Cristiana?

13:14.245 --> 13:15.245
Yes.

13:16.165 --> 13:17.645
Thanks for coming.

13:18.365 --> 13:20.125
I've heard great things about you.

13:20.645 --> 13:21.765
I do my duty.

13:22.365 --> 13:23.605
You're modest, too.

13:24.045 --> 13:27.405
So, what did you want to talk to me about?

13:27.725 --> 13:29.405
You were friends with Franco Marchilli,

13:29.485 --> 13:32.445
Deputy Inspector Gabriele Marchilli's
father, isn't that right?

13:32.525 --> 13:33.885
Yes.

13:33.965 --> 13:35.645
We were colleagues.

13:35.725 --> 13:36.885
And very close.

13:39.365 --> 13:41.765
-How did you know that?
-I asked around.

13:41.845 --> 13:44.325
I needed to speak to someone
from outside my station.

13:45.485 --> 13:47.365
-About what?
-About Gabriele.

13:50.325 --> 13:51.325
Go on.

13:53.005 --> 13:55.885
I don't know, he's acting strangely.

13:57.005 --> 13:58.565
But maybe I'm imagining things.

14:00.165 --> 14:01.965
You can speak to me freely about it.

14:03.325 --> 14:05.885
In three months,
he's gotten one promotion after another.

14:06.405 --> 14:07.565
It's not normal.

14:08.485 --> 14:11.165
Not even for the son of a policeman
who died in the line of duty.

14:14.365 --> 14:15.525
What has he done?

14:15.605 --> 14:18.045
We did an identity check
at the Adami villa.

14:18.685 --> 14:21.205
He had information
from one of his father's informants.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.285
But we didn't find anything.

14:25.445 --> 14:27.165
Franco didn't have informants.

14:29.965 --> 14:31.205
That's not all.

14:31.285 --> 14:34.085
During the check, he disappeared.

14:34.165 --> 14:37.925
And when we were about to go inside
he came back and told us to leave.

14:40.845 --> 14:43.605
His father told me
that Lele was keeping bad company.

14:46.565 --> 14:48.525
And that he'd seen him
together with Samurai.

14:49.285 --> 14:50.285
Samurai.

14:51.885 --> 14:54.565
I've been looking for something
on him for three months.

14:54.645 --> 14:57.485
I'm certain he had something to do
with the death of Lele's father.

14:59.045 --> 15:00.205
What should I do?

15:02.885 --> 15:04.165
Keep an eye on him.

15:04.645 --> 15:06.485
Track all his movements

15:06.565 --> 15:08.045
and keep me informed.

15:19.045 --> 15:21.485
Why am I seeing Sara Monaschi again?

15:21.565 --> 15:25.085
-How did she get involved in this?
-She's working with a cardinal.

15:25.165 --> 15:27.525
-Fiorenzo Nascari.
-You've got to get him out of my way.

15:27.605 --> 15:30.805
Right now, I can't do anything
that could compromise me.

15:30.885 --> 15:33.165
I'm expecting an important post.

15:33.245 --> 15:36.205
-I need to lie low.
-I couldn't give a shit about your post.

15:36.285 --> 15:39.085
I gotta start construction work
before the new city council takes power.

15:39.165 --> 15:41.525
-Why?
-Important people want it that way.

15:41.605 --> 15:43.245
I can't do anything this time.

15:43.325 --> 15:46.645
And Nascari's not the sort
to be swayed easily.

15:46.725 --> 15:48.125
What does that mean?

15:48.445 --> 15:49.725
That he's not like me.

15:55.165 --> 15:56.885
He'll just cost more.

16:02.085 --> 16:04.125
-Where's Alberto?
-I don't know.

16:05.165 --> 16:08.645
When you speak to him,
because I know that you speak to him,

16:08.725 --> 16:11.365
tell him that what he did
has put him against the family.

16:12.045 --> 16:13.565
He was right to run.

16:14.245 --> 16:16.405
Starting today,
you and he can't stay here anymore.

16:17.085 --> 16:18.885
-This is our home.
-No!

16:19.525 --> 16:21.405
This is my house!

16:22.365 --> 16:24.885
And now you're leaving it. Alone.

16:25.405 --> 16:28.245
Seeing that your husband
doesn't even want to be by your side.

16:28.325 --> 16:30.405
You'll go to our relatives in Abruzzo.

16:30.965 --> 16:33.485
How do you think my father will take
you kicking me out?

16:33.845 --> 16:36.405
Your father
is not in charge of you anymore.

16:37.085 --> 16:40.325
You married Spadino
and now you've got to do what I say.

16:45.045 --> 16:46.725
During the day he's at the stables.

16:46.805 --> 16:49.005
-Just wait till he leaves.
-Then I'll follow him.

16:49.085 --> 16:51.645
We've got to get him
when none of his people are around.

16:51.725 --> 16:53.885
So we can finally get him
out of the fucking way!

16:53.965 --> 16:57.365
Hey, if you go in this car,
they'll spot you in five minutes.

16:57.445 --> 16:59.325
Relax, I'll get another one.

17:00.525 --> 17:01.725
I'll get myself a gun.

17:07.005 --> 17:08.165
Angelica?

17:10.285 --> 17:11.645
What does she want to do?

17:15.205 --> 17:17.005
No, Angelica, you have to stay calm.

17:17.084 --> 17:21.565
Yes. For now do whatever my mother says.
When I get back I'll sort everything out.

17:23.084 --> 17:24.604
No, I'm not dumping you.

17:25.565 --> 17:27.364
I've got something important to do now.

17:28.285 --> 17:30.925
Everything's going to change,
I promise you. Trust me.

17:31.005 --> 17:32.005
Bye.

17:44.205 --> 17:45.685
How are things with Angelica?

17:49.445 --> 17:50.565
I care for her.

17:51.805 --> 17:53.885
What does "care for" mean? Care for!

17:57.005 --> 17:58.165
What does it mean?

18:00.325 --> 18:01.925
It means we're having a baby.

18:05.765 --> 18:07.565
And that I am seeing this guy.

18:11.245 --> 18:12.725
What can I say, Aureliano?

18:12.805 --> 18:16.765
Marriage is serious business.
You've got to find a way to make it work.

18:23.765 --> 18:25.085
Turn right here.

18:39.885 --> 18:42.285
You're going to be a father.
Don't get yourself shot!

18:48.125 --> 18:49.565
CHILDREN'S PARADISE

18:57.165 --> 18:58.525
What do you want now?

19:00.925 --> 19:02.725
I need two guns.

19:03.765 --> 19:04.845
And you're asking me?

19:07.965 --> 19:10.325
Your guys bolted, right? What happened?

19:10.405 --> 19:12.525
Nothing happened.
Are you going to help me out or not?

19:12.605 --> 19:16.005
I'm sorry, but I can't help you.
My cousins took everything.

19:16.085 --> 19:18.365
-They're in charge now.
-Imagine that.

19:18.445 --> 19:19.725
I told you, didn't I?

19:21.725 --> 19:23.405
Where are those two dipshits?

19:25.925 --> 19:27.845
What do you need the guns for?

19:30.125 --> 19:32.605
-Look, if you want my help, tell me.
-Okay.

19:35.845 --> 19:37.125
[in Sinti] [Attention!]

19:37.965 --> 19:40.085
[Attention! Quiet!]

19:40.525 --> 19:41.525
[Quiet!]

19:45.685 --> 19:48.125
[Today, we need to make
an important decision.]

19:48.205 --> 19:50.885
[And we need to make it together.]

19:51.925 --> 19:54.605
[Our family has a chance
to take over Ostia.]

19:54.685 --> 19:57.125
[It's all set up, but we need more money.]

19:57.525 --> 20:00.205
[And we Anacletis
have got to come up with it.]

20:01.245 --> 20:03.125
[And when would this money come back?]

20:03.685 --> 20:07.405
[It isn't the time to think about that.
Think about what we'll earn.]

20:08.845 --> 20:11.325
-[We need money for dowries, weddings...]
-[Christenings...]

20:11.405 --> 20:12.685
Come with me.

20:12.765 --> 20:14.525
[But when do we want to be bosses?]

20:25.805 --> 20:27.605
The old lady's furious.

20:28.805 --> 20:31.245
She wants to run things,
but she wastes time talking.

20:31.325 --> 20:33.645
We would have had these discussions
with Manfredi, too.

20:33.725 --> 20:35.325
-I really don't think so.
-No?

20:36.165 --> 20:39.045
When it comes to coughing up cash,
everyone's deaf.

20:40.325 --> 20:42.285
And no one ponies up a lira.

20:42.365 --> 20:44.365
It all depends on how you ask.

20:45.165 --> 20:47.245
Our problem is that we never think big.

20:51.885 --> 20:53.205
Where are you taking me?

20:57.565 --> 20:59.005
To some relatives in Sulmona.

21:08.285 --> 21:11.845
-Okay, but I've got to go somewhere first.
-Don't make trouble for me, Angelica.

21:11.925 --> 21:15.845
I don't want to make trouble for you,
but maybe I know how to fix Adelaide's.

21:17.605 --> 21:20.005
If you help me and I'm right,
you'll make her happy, too.

21:21.805 --> 21:22.805
Well?

21:24.205 --> 21:25.885
I'm not playing around here.

21:30.085 --> 21:31.085
Where?

21:31.925 --> 21:32.925
Drive.

21:48.525 --> 21:49.885
Get a move on.

21:50.885 --> 21:52.685
Go get everything ready at the warehouse.

22:06.005 --> 22:07.325
-Hey, Aureliano.
- Hi.

22:07.405 --> 22:08.525
They're on the move.

22:08.605 --> 22:11.365
There's more than ten of them.
They loaded gasoline and other stuff.

22:12.085 --> 22:15.565
- They're up to something. Is he there?
-No.

22:15.645 --> 22:17.845
Maybe I should go inside
and see if I discover anything.

22:17.925 --> 22:20.205
No, don't do anything stupid.
Wait until I get the guns.

22:20.285 --> 22:22.205
Okay, I'll wait here. Sure.

22:22.805 --> 22:24.165
Bye.

22:41.205 --> 22:43.645
-What's going on?
-I need to talk to you, Dad.

22:46.445 --> 22:47.525
Let's go inside.

22:54.485 --> 22:55.885
Tell me where the guns are.

22:55.965 --> 22:58.165
As soon as you go inside,
there's a white van.

22:58.245 --> 22:59.605
They're inside it.

23:02.125 --> 23:04.325
If you notice anything strange,
let me know.

24:18.165 --> 24:19.565
What the fuck--

24:19.645 --> 24:21.005
Piece of shit!

24:38.125 --> 24:40.365
I keep it close to see straight

24:40.445 --> 24:43.805
To remember that if it all goes bust
I can carry the weight

24:43.885 --> 24:45.885
To remember that it really was great

24:45.965 --> 24:49.605
If my friends have left me to my fate
And you can still see it on my face

24:49.685 --> 24:52.325
Even if it burns
I won't renounce the faith I have in me

24:52.405 --> 24:55.085
Live with pain and a new you you'll see

24:55.165 --> 24:57.565
And I'm sorry if everything I ever sold

24:57.645 --> 25:00.605
Is like a punch in the gut
And I feel cold

25:00.685 --> 25:02.845
And they told me
No one gets out of this shit

25:02.925 --> 25:06.245
That's not true
There's someone I admire who's doing it

25:06.325 --> 25:09.125
The told me people don't change
But I don't believe 'em

25:09.205 --> 25:11.645
I look at Marco and grin

25:11.725 --> 25:15.005
And I see the place where I play
Going to hell and I pray

25:15.085 --> 25:17.365
You ask me for everything
But not to stay

25:17.445 --> 25:20.405
I don't know my destiny
Love is my priority

25:20.485 --> 25:22.965
I live in defeat like a refugee

25:23.045 --> 25:25.805
I want to be next to you
Stand by me

25:25.885 --> 25:28.565
It's by holding close that we'll fly high

25:28.645 --> 25:31.245
It's with the proper distance, we now see

25:31.325 --> 25:34.245
That it all ends very, very badly

25:34.325 --> 25:37.045
I want to be next to you
Stand by me

25:37.125 --> 25:39.765
It's by holding close that we'll fly high

25:39.845 --> 25:42.285
It's with the proper distance, we now see

25:42.365 --> 25:45.605
That it all ends very, very badly

25:46.685 --> 25:48.925
Thanks for coming at this hour.

25:49.005 --> 25:50.845
Not at all, it's my job.

25:59.245 --> 26:00.965
You see how he's...

26:02.445 --> 26:04.805
Something spooked him,
but I've got no idea what.

26:07.445 --> 26:10.405
Ah, Doctor, there's this mare
we need to check out, too.

26:15.725 --> 26:16.925
I told you!

26:17.005 --> 26:18.005
I know him.

26:18.085 --> 26:20.205
He's not a man whose toes you can step on.

26:20.285 --> 26:21.645
Try to calm down.

26:22.325 --> 26:26.645
-Did he threaten you?
-Of course! Why do you think he came here?

26:28.085 --> 26:30.325
We're up against powerful people.

26:31.245 --> 26:32.565
We knew it.

26:33.605 --> 26:37.445
But we're protecting those refugees,
and that takes courage.

26:37.525 --> 26:40.085
And I'm sure you're not short of that.

26:40.165 --> 26:41.645
That's why I chose you.

26:41.725 --> 26:43.605
I'm not short of it.

26:43.685 --> 26:47.965
But on my own, against that man,
there's nothing I can do.

26:48.045 --> 26:50.725
Sara, you're not on your own.

26:52.925 --> 26:55.925
You can't come here and bust my balls.
Do you understand?

26:56.005 --> 26:57.765
Hey, relax.

26:57.845 --> 26:59.525
It'll only take a minute.

27:00.045 --> 27:02.605
You're watching the land
with the refugees on it, right?

27:04.525 --> 27:07.805
Tonight, see to it
that when one patrol comes off duty,

27:07.885 --> 27:09.885
the next one starts half an hour later.

27:09.965 --> 27:11.765
And tell us when the coast is clear.

27:11.845 --> 27:12.925
-A piece of cake.
-No.

27:13.005 --> 27:14.245
It's impossible.

27:14.325 --> 27:15.845
I don't oversee the patrols.

27:15.925 --> 27:17.205
So what?

27:17.285 --> 27:20.245
You're a deputy inspector, don't tell me
you don't count for shit, Lele.

27:22.205 --> 27:23.245
Now you can go.

27:25.205 --> 27:26.205
Get out!

27:42.005 --> 27:44.005
[in Sinti] [I can find the money for you.]

27:45.165 --> 27:46.405
[But on one condition.]

27:47.165 --> 27:48.125
[What condition?]

27:48.565 --> 27:50.165
[That my daughter

27:50.245 --> 27:51.365
oversees the deal.]

27:51.965 --> 27:52.765
What?

27:53.365 --> 27:56.165
I think it's better
if Angelica manages this whole business.

27:56.245 --> 27:58.205
And therefore, she stays in Rome,

27:58.285 --> 27:59.285
inside this house,

27:59.725 --> 28:01.685
where she married your son.

28:01.765 --> 28:03.805
[The mother-in-law decides
for the daughter-in-law.]

28:03.885 --> 28:04.885
[Not the father.]

28:04.965 --> 28:06.685
But you're asking the father for money.

28:14.405 --> 28:15.205
Well?

28:15.285 --> 28:18.245
-The hour is late.
-All right.

28:19.725 --> 28:21.325
We'll do as you say.

28:57.685 --> 28:59.685
PATROL VEHICLE ROSTER

29:32.005 --> 29:33.725
I've done what I could.

29:34.405 --> 29:36.405
I'll come by in a couple of days to see...

31:03.165 --> 31:04.165
Let's go.

31:10.885 --> 31:12.085
Close the door.

31:23.685 --> 31:25.925
-What is this place?
-A hotel.

31:27.005 --> 31:29.525
It was ours, but no one's been in here
for twenty years.

31:31.525 --> 31:32.725
I'm staying here now.

31:32.805 --> 31:35.725
Your cousins will be looking for you,
so you'll sleep here tonight.

31:36.605 --> 31:38.805
-Who says so?
-I say so.

31:46.805 --> 31:48.085
-Hey, Spadino.
-Aureliano.

31:48.165 --> 31:50.685
The rat's finally come out into the open.

31:50.765 --> 31:53.685
-Why are you talking funny? Where are you?
-In the stables.

31:53.765 --> 31:55.445
What do you mean, "inside the stables"?

31:55.525 --> 31:58.565
Yes, I managed to sneak in.
Leave it to me.

31:59.085 --> 32:00.885
-Where is he?
-He's here.

32:01.725 --> 32:03.285
What are you going to do now, Spadino?

32:03.965 --> 32:05.165
-I just heard from them.
- Hey!

32:05.245 --> 32:06.445
The guys are ready.

32:06.525 --> 32:07.685
Got to go. Call you back.

32:07.765 --> 32:09.485
Make sure you do it right.

32:09.565 --> 32:11.205
Wait, Spadino...

32:11.285 --> 32:12.285
Spadino?

32:13.525 --> 32:16.285
You have to look angry, like people
who are fed up with the situation.

32:16.365 --> 32:19.605
There can't be any deaths,
otherwise they'll confiscate the land,

32:19.685 --> 32:20.765
and that'll be that.

32:21.525 --> 32:22.525
Okay?

32:39.845 --> 32:41.565
-Samurai.
-What is it?

32:46.565 --> 32:48.965
-Well?
-Someone's here to see you.

32:51.005 --> 32:53.205
Listen, get rid of these fucking flyers.

32:54.245 --> 32:58.325
With everything I spent on this campaign,
you could have at least handed them out!

33:22.165 --> 33:23.725
MORE SECURITY
IN THE OUTER BOROUGHS

33:27.285 --> 33:30.525
Samurai asked me to send the patrol cars
away from the refugee camp.

33:31.525 --> 33:33.045
No, I don't know why.

33:34.565 --> 33:35.605
So, what do we do?

33:36.085 --> 33:38.045
We wait until Spadino calls us back.

33:40.245 --> 33:41.845
Meanwhile, you come here.

33:42.605 --> 33:44.645
-Where?
-To the hotel.

33:44.725 --> 33:46.445
Okay, I'm on my way.

33:49.445 --> 33:52.925
-Why did you decide to come and see me?
-I wanted to look you in the face.

33:54.605 --> 33:56.285
To see how much you've changed.

33:56.365 --> 33:58.445
I would have liked to have you by my side.

33:58.965 --> 34:00.725
You're the one who decided to leave.

34:00.805 --> 34:03.085
-There must have been a reason, right?
-Oh!

34:04.085 --> 34:05.525
Still a hardass, huh?

34:05.605 --> 34:07.165
I'm still the same.

34:08.285 --> 34:10.925
-I haven't betrayed my ideals.
-Me neither.

34:11.005 --> 34:12.405
I'm just older than you.

34:13.485 --> 34:14.485
Wiser.

34:15.724 --> 34:19.164
Once it made sense to get into fights
over ideals, but not now.

34:21.204 --> 34:23.365
Come on, let's not create bad blood.

34:23.445 --> 34:25.365
We haven't seen each other for years.
Come on.

34:28.805 --> 34:30.885
I remember you as a kid.

34:30.965 --> 34:34.325
-Look at you, you've become a man.
-And you've gotten old.

34:42.244 --> 34:43.805
I spoke to the cop. It's all set.

34:43.885 --> 34:46.125
I'll join the guys
at the warehouse and we'll go.

34:46.204 --> 34:47.765
I'm coming too.

34:47.845 --> 34:49.925
I want to make sure you don't fuck up.

34:53.045 --> 34:55.244
You and me still think the same way.

34:55.724 --> 34:58.805
And tonight I'm going to prove it to you.
Come with me.

34:59.365 --> 35:01.005
I'll show you I haven't changed.

35:22.645 --> 35:24.285
You had me worried. What's going on?

35:24.365 --> 35:27.965
Samurai's men are organizing something.
But I'm not sure where they're going.

35:28.045 --> 35:29.965
-Is he there?
-He just left.

35:34.165 --> 35:36.085
-Aureliano...
-Wait.

35:38.885 --> 35:41.005
What time did Samurai ask you
to move the cops?

35:42.165 --> 35:43.365
In an hour.

35:44.365 --> 35:47.085
Spadino, I know where they're going.

35:47.165 --> 35:48.885
-Go to the refugee camp. Quickly.
-Okay.

36:05.285 --> 36:06.285
A gin and tonic.

36:07.285 --> 36:08.605
I'm good, thanks.

36:10.325 --> 36:11.645
Well?

36:11.725 --> 36:14.245
You haven't even started
and you already want to swap teams?

36:14.805 --> 36:16.885
-No. Look, it's absolutely not--
-What are you doing?

36:16.965 --> 36:18.045
Justifying yourself?

36:19.885 --> 36:21.125
How many votes did you get?

36:22.125 --> 36:23.645
Why, don't you know?

36:23.725 --> 36:26.965
Yes, but I bet someone as meticulous
as you remembers the exact number.

36:29.725 --> 36:31.885
I got 230,423.

36:31.965 --> 36:33.045
There. See?

36:33.885 --> 36:35.285
You didn't expect it, did you?

36:35.365 --> 36:37.765
Well, I ran a very long campaign.

36:38.925 --> 36:40.325
I didn't stop for one second.

36:40.405 --> 36:43.525
It's clear that you're driven,
a hard worker.

36:44.085 --> 36:45.565
What do you want in exchange?

36:46.445 --> 36:48.725
-To partner with your coalition.
-I know that.

36:50.565 --> 36:52.685
But what do you want in exchange
for yourself?

36:54.005 --> 36:56.245
Shouldn't we be talking about policies?

36:56.325 --> 36:58.525
-About programs?
-Really?

36:58.605 --> 37:02.285
-Cross-party agreements.
-How to improve social programs?

37:07.445 --> 37:09.965
The right-wing coalition
is a very practical one.

37:10.045 --> 37:12.085
We talk straight. Tell me what you want.

37:14.365 --> 37:17.845
A commissionership and one of my men
as head of the mayor's cabinet.

37:20.765 --> 37:23.125
The smaller you are,
the more you want to eat.

37:28.005 --> 37:31.525
-Well?
-Well, I'm not the one who decides.

37:31.605 --> 37:33.565
I'll speak to my party and let you know.

37:35.205 --> 37:38.565
Barzacci, I didn't come here
to be dicked around.

37:38.645 --> 37:40.405
These are things that you decide.

37:40.485 --> 37:43.005
But that aren't decided
while sitting at a bar.

37:51.485 --> 37:52.965
I'll let you know.

38:18.445 --> 38:21.085
-Well?
-Haven't seen anyone yet.

38:24.045 --> 38:25.445
They're leaving now.

38:47.525 --> 38:49.645
-Hi, baby.
-Why aren't you at home?

38:49.725 --> 38:52.005
The meeting ran late. I just got back now.

38:52.085 --> 38:55.005
-So, how did it go with Barzacci?
-He's taking his time.

38:55.845 --> 38:57.885
He said he's not the one who decides.

38:58.765 --> 39:01.925
As if I didn't know his party called him
to Rome for that purpose.

39:02.005 --> 39:03.805
-And so?
-And so nothing.

39:03.885 --> 39:06.805
Alice, it's impossible
to know what these guys are thinking.

39:06.885 --> 39:10.005
-Sure, but did he seem positive to you--
-My compliments, madam.

39:10.085 --> 39:11.965
Good evening, Mr. Cinaglia.

39:12.045 --> 39:14.605
Come with us.
There's someone who wants to talk to you.

39:24.485 --> 39:26.245
-When you're ready.
-Yes. Of course.

39:27.245 --> 39:28.725
-After you.
-Go on, sweetheart.

39:28.805 --> 39:31.005
The babysitter needs to go home.
It's late.

39:32.565 --> 39:33.565
Goodbye.

39:35.645 --> 39:36.925
I'll talk to you later.

39:43.885 --> 39:45.005
Here they are.

40:01.205 --> 40:02.845
I don't see Samurai.

40:03.885 --> 40:05.245
He's got to be there. For sure.

40:07.245 --> 40:08.245
Let's go.

40:25.725 --> 40:28.045
They're all asleep. Go in quietly.

40:28.805 --> 40:32.005
And make sure you don't aim
at the tents where they're sleeping!

40:33.925 --> 40:38.125
They've taken Ostia for a dump
and now they'll learn their lesson.

41:29.965 --> 41:31.405
Let's split up.

41:36.485 --> 41:38.245
What the fuck's going on?

41:38.325 --> 41:39.685
Wait here.

41:39.765 --> 41:41.045
There's a tent on fire.

41:53.485 --> 41:54.765
Are you lost?

42:07.365 --> 42:11.965
Come here! What the fuck are you doing?
I said not the tents!

42:12.165 --> 42:13.525
-Where's Saverio?
-I don't know!

42:13.605 --> 42:15.085
Go and find him! Go!

42:21.925 --> 42:23.805
Come on! Come with me!

42:30.165 --> 42:32.285
-Come on, Aureliano! Let's go.
-Where the fuck is he?

42:41.685 --> 42:42.725
Help!

42:47.005 --> 42:50.005
Help!

43:02.565 --> 43:03.605
Come on, get in.

43:05.605 --> 43:08.445
-Adriano, we've got to go!
-This has nothing to do with ideals.

43:10.125 --> 43:11.925
What's your angle with this land?

43:12.005 --> 43:13.765
Why are they trying to kill you?

43:14.605 --> 43:17.085
What do we do now?
All hell is breaking loose here!

43:18.445 --> 43:19.525
Let's go.

43:40.445 --> 43:42.885
Sara!

43:42.965 --> 43:44.565
Wake up, Sara!

43:45.285 --> 43:46.685
Wake up, come on.

44:49.125 --> 44:50.365
Cinaglia.

44:50.885 --> 44:52.325
What have you done?

45:02.005 --> 45:04.325
