we only sang the last two words?

00:06.391 --> 00:08.325
What happened
to the happy birthday part?

00:08.392 --> 00:10.026
- Well, you know troy's
a jehovah's witness.

00:10.094 --> 00:11.027
- He doesn't celebrate
birthdays.

00:11.095 --> 00:12.228

00:12.296 --> 00:13.797
To keep the language
on the cake compliant.

Happy expulsion, troy,

But after cake,
we cram for realsies.

00:28.014 --> 00:29.581
Guys, finals are coming up.

00:29.648 --> 00:31.348
- Yeah. This group is starting
to use special occasions

00:31.416 --> 00:32.815
To avoid studying.

00:32.883 --> 00:35.050
Last week we had fondue
and played boggle

00:35.118 --> 00:36.885
Because shirley's niece
took her first bath.

00:36.953 --> 00:39.254
- With bubbles.
- Thank you. It's a milestone.

00:39.322 --> 00:41.056

was my birthday,

00:41.124 --> 00:43.225
And nobody noticed
and nobody cared.

00:45.228 --> 00:47.063

You don't remember
the huge party we threw?

00:50.164 --> 00:51.898
We need to talk about
those pain killers you're taking

00:51.965 --> 00:54.367
Because don't think
you're remembering anything.

00:54.434 --> 00:55.601

01:45.646 --> 01:46.779
I got a cousin in detroit.

01:46.847 --> 01:48.280
They're not crazy about it

02:08.633 --> 02:11.434
And french cinematographer
claude renoir.

02:11.502 --> 02:12.902
- [whispers]
yes! Jackpot!

02:12.970 --> 02:14.603
- On the chinese calendar,
troy is a horse.

02:16.539 --> 02:18.774
"purposeful, self-possessed,
and gregarious."

02:18.841 --> 02:20.942
- No. I'm pretty sure
I'm a snake.

02:21.010 --> 02:22.911
I remember because
I'm determined, self-possessed,

02:22.979 --> 02:24.145
And mendacious.

02:24.213 --> 02:25.813
- Pierce, what is this?
What are you doing?

02:25.881 --> 02:27.181
Explain yourself.

02:27.249 --> 02:29.150
- Who made this
crappy cake anyway?

02:29.218 --> 02:30.485
- A cake maker.
At a cake store.

02:30.552 --> 02:31.652
- They did it wrong.

02:31.720 --> 02:33.787
- Troy, we're 1990.
We're horses.

02:33.855 --> 02:34.855
- I was born in '89.

02:34.923 --> 02:36.156
- Then...

02:36.224 --> 02:38.191
You were born 21 years ago.

02:38.259 --> 02:39.659
- Which would make me 20,

02:39.727 --> 02:42.662
Because everyone
is 10 for two years.

02:42.729 --> 02:45.764
Because fifth grade
is really hard for every...One.

[yelling] mom, how many lies

02:50.703 --> 02:53.170
As in
"the legal drinking age"?

02:53.238 --> 02:55.205

02:55.273 --> 02:57.474
- This party just became
unacceptable--we're going out.

02:57.542 --> 02:58.942

- But you guys were just

02:59.010 --> 03:00.277
Complaining about us having
too many parties.

- Too many lame ones.
This is real.

- Well, what makes it real?
- Well, shirley, think of it

03:03.981 --> 03:05.481
As troy
taking his first bath,

03:05.549 --> 03:07.149
Only the bubbles
are his manhood.

03:07.217 --> 03:09.151
- Yes. I wanna bathe
in manhood.

03:09.219 --> 03:10.952
Together: Oh!

03:11.020 --> 03:12.620
- I'm taking you to l street.

03:12.687 --> 03:14.454

douche street.

03:14.521 --> 03:16.188

you hate cool bars.

03:16.255 --> 03:18.756
I don't suppose you've
ever even been to l street.

03:18.824 --> 03:21.458
- No. But I also haven't been
to beirut.

03:21.526 --> 03:24.527
But I'm sure
I will go one day,

03:24.595 --> 03:27.564

03:29.866 --> 03:32.100

your great suggestions.

03:34.102 --> 03:36.170
- The red door.
- Oh, yeah, the red door!

03:36.238 --> 03:38.006
The red hipster.
- Not hipster.

03:38.074 --> 03:39.141
Hipsters haven't
discovered it yet.

03:39.209 --> 03:40.643
It's underound.

03:40.711 --> 03:43.645

03:43.713 --> 03:44.846
They serve virgin mudslides.

03:44.914 --> 03:46.247
- Those are milk shakes,
shirley.

03:46.315 --> 03:48.215
- You guys! All you
think about is yourselves.

03:48.283 --> 03:51.151
Think about me. I'm 19.
I can't get into bars.

03:51.219 --> 03:52.219
- Well...
- [fakes crying]

03:52.286 --> 03:55.388

- Okay, well...

03:55.456 --> 03:56.422
Have fun.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.924

03:58.992 --> 04:00.693
Fine.
I'll get annie an I.D.

It just won't be yours.

04:03.497 --> 04:05.164
I will see you
at the red door.

04:05.232 --> 04:06.833
- Nice try. We're not going
to red poet's society.

04:06.900 --> 04:08.567
- Well, we're not going
to douche street either.

04:08.635 --> 04:10.635
- Fine. Count of three,
name the least offensive bar

04:10.703 --> 04:12.236
You've ever been to.

04:12.304 --> 04:13.404
One, two, three.

Flannahan's hole.

04:15.039 --> 04:16.673
Done.
Troy, you ride with me?

04:16.740 --> 04:17.940
- Do you even have to ask?

04:18.007 --> 04:20.009
- Pierce, do you wanna
ride in my van?

04:20.077 --> 04:21.209
- I'm not a disabled.

04:21.278 --> 04:23.111
I don't need people
helping me

04:23.179 --> 04:24.813
Do normal things
and doting over me...

04:24.881 --> 04:26.747
Why don't you just leave--

04:28.250 --> 04:30.251
Okay!
I'll beat you there.

04:30.318 --> 04:32.887
- I don't think this girl
looks very much like me.

04:32.954 --> 04:34.788
- Come on.
She's a white brunette.

04:34.856 --> 04:37.257
- So is anne hathaway.
- Go on?

04:37.324 --> 04:38.524
- What's your friend doing

04:38.592 --> 04:39.992
With a stack
of other people's I.D.S?

04:40.060 --> 04:42.094
- I don't know--
sometimes people sell their I.D.

04:42.161 --> 04:43.895
When they're leaving the state
and need cash.

04:43.963 --> 04:45.763
- So she's a drifter.

04:45.831 --> 04:46.931
A floater.

04:46.999 --> 04:49.034
An urchin.

04:49.101 --> 04:51.669
Caroline decker
from corpus christi, texas.

04:51.737 --> 04:53.537
Texas?
Do I need an accent?

04:53.605 --> 04:55.272
- You don't need an accent.

04:55.340 --> 04:57.974
- Howdy, y'all.
I'm caroline decker.

04:58.042 --> 04:59.409

05:02.212 --> 05:04.046

corpus christi.

05:04.114 --> 05:05.080
- Annie, relax.

05:05.148 --> 05:07.015
I'm not a relaxed person,
britta.

05:07.082 --> 05:08.349

I don't improvise my life
like...Caroline decker,

05:11.352 --> 05:12.686
Who probably has
really bad credit

05:12.754 --> 05:14.587
And an unfinished
mermaid tattoo.

05:14.655 --> 05:15.755
[cell phone rings]

05:15.823 --> 05:17.923
- What?
- Flannahan's hole is closed.

05:17.991 --> 05:20.258
That's not a--
I-I'm not being clever.

05:20.326 --> 05:21.960
I mean it's out of business.

05:22.027 --> 05:24.295
- Well, that's what they get
for trying to please everyone.

05:24.363 --> 05:26.297
So now what?
- Well, there's a place

05:26.365 --> 05:27.632
At third and water.

05:27.699 --> 05:30.300
It's fun, divey,
but not staph infection divey.

05:30.368 --> 05:34.237
It's either got a gross name
or an ironically fancy one.

05:34.305 --> 05:36.572
Possibly both.
- Oh. The ballroom. Good.

05:36.640 --> 05:38.940
- Go to third and water.
- Wait--what?

05:39.008 --> 05:41.143
That wasn't the deal!
- Shirley's pushing back.

05:41.211 --> 05:43.145
- Why, because they don't have
plastic menus and milk shakes?

05:43.213 --> 05:45.414
- Why, because they don't--
- don't repeat that, you goon!

05:45.481 --> 05:48.583
Jeez. Look, just--
the women are your problem,

05:48.651 --> 05:50.318
And the men
are going to the ballroom.

05:50.385 --> 05:52.119
And now I guess I am
being clever.

05:52.186 --> 05:54.788
[muzak playing]

05:54.855 --> 05:56.522
- So...Plastic menus
are bad?

05:56.590 --> 05:59.258
See, this is the kinda stuff
I need to learn.

05:59.326 --> 06:00.993
Plastic menus seems like
a great idea to me

06:01.060 --> 06:02.928
For when you spill
something on them,

06:02.995 --> 06:04.329
And then your mom says,
"hey, troy,

06:04.397 --> 06:06.130
You're ruining fuddruckers
for everyone."

06:06.198 --> 06:08.332
- Troy...You're entering
the next chapter of your life.

06:08.400 --> 06:10.334
Sadly, it's the final chapter,

06:10.401 --> 06:11.969
But it's also the longest.

06:12.036 --> 06:13.837
And if you play it right,
the best.

06:13.905 --> 06:16.139
You and I...
We're just two guys now.

06:16.206 --> 06:18.374
Peers. Equals.

06:18.442 --> 06:19.942
- So awesome.

06:20.010 --> 06:21.943
Maybe later
you'll let me drive your car.

06:22.011 --> 06:24.178

06:24.246 --> 06:26.847
[both laughing]

06:26.915 --> 06:31.251

06:33.420 --> 06:36.388
- Hello, former enemy.

06:36.456 --> 06:38.023
- He's 21 at midnight.
Cool?

06:38.091 --> 06:39.024
- Yeah. Happy birthday.

06:39.091 --> 06:40.558
- Thanks.

06:40.626 --> 06:42.393
- Uh, I-I don't like
this place.

06:42.461 --> 06:44.395
- Ugh. You made that clear,
shirley. Oy vey.

06:44.463 --> 06:46.897
- Caroline decker
from corpus christi.

06:46.965 --> 06:48.232
- Annie,
you don't need an accent.

06:48.299 --> 06:50.367
- If my I.D. Says texas,
they'll be suspicious.

06:50.434 --> 06:51.901
- They're not gonna question
your I.D.

06:51.969 --> 06:53.102
Because you're a hot girl.

06:53.170 --> 06:54.403
We're good for business.

06:54.471 --> 06:55.504
The hotter you are,

06:55.572 --> 06:57.139
The more they'll risk the fine.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.143
- Howdy?

07:02.211 --> 07:03.978
- Go ahead.

07:05.947 --> 07:07.247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:13.387 --> 07:14.921
Can't be too careful.

07:14.989 --> 07:18.190
- I understand.

07:18.258 --> 07:20.259
Hey, hey, shirley!

07:20.327 --> 07:21.827
Welcome back!

07:22.962 --> 07:25.263
- You don't know me.
Hmm?

07:25.330 --> 07:26.597
Okay?

07:26.665 --> 07:27.665
- [quietly]
yeah.

07:27.732 --> 07:29.466
- You don't...Know me.

07:35.799 --> 07:36.898
- This place is all right!

07:36.966 --> 07:38.299
- Yeah. It's okay.

07:38.367 --> 07:40.300
- These pictures must be
of all the regulars.

07:40.367 --> 07:42.235
You think someday I can
make it up to this wall?

07:42.302 --> 07:44.570
- I don't say this often,
troy, but...

07:44.638 --> 07:46.472
Dream a little smaller.

07:48.708 --> 07:50.242
- Can I get you guys anything?
- Oh!

07:50.309 --> 07:52.843
I-I'm okay!
- Another macallan. Neat.

07:52.911 --> 07:55.345
- Vodka. Neat. Four olives.
- I'm waiting till midnight.

07:55.413 --> 07:56.813
All: Aw!

07:56.881 --> 07:58.648
- Sweetie?

07:58.716 --> 08:00.183
- Water!

08:00.251 --> 08:01.250
- Oh, where's that
accent from?

08:01.318 --> 08:03.486
- Corpus christi.
Texas.

08:03.553 --> 08:05.020
78418.

08:05.088 --> 08:06.188
- What are you doin'
here in town?

08:06.256 --> 08:07.889
- Not much, I reckon...

08:07.957 --> 08:09.757
Just driftin', floatin',

08:09.825 --> 08:12.059
Spittin' in the wind.

08:12.127 --> 08:13.760
General waywardness.

08:13.828 --> 08:15.595
- All righty.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.531
- Annie, you're in the bar.

08:17.598 --> 08:20.166
You don't have to be
from texas anymore.

08:20.234 --> 08:22.234
- I don't know how it works.
I'm not a barfly, britta.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.002
- They have asteroids.
Slide out.

08:24.070 --> 08:25.504
- O-okay.
Oh! Oh! Okay.

08:25.571 --> 08:28.272
I-I'm gonna go take
a little look around.

08:28.340 --> 08:29.607
- Me too.
- Annie.

08:29.674 --> 08:31.408
Don't accept any drinks.

08:31.475 --> 08:34.443
- Or invitations
to the bathroom.

08:34.510 --> 08:37.111
- So what are you gonna order
for your first legal drink?

08:37.179 --> 08:38.947
- What should I get?
- Whatever you want.

08:39.015 --> 08:40.914
- No wrong answers.
- I like beer.

08:40.982 --> 08:42.517
- Don't order beer.
- You've had beer.

08:42.583 --> 08:44.551
- W-what should I get?

08:44.619 --> 08:46.753
- Well, what do you think
you might like?

08:46.820 --> 08:47.921
I mean,
it's your world now.

08:47.989 --> 08:50.090
- Follow your heart.
- My uncle carl

08:50.158 --> 08:51.959
Played a big role in my life.

08:52.027 --> 08:53.260
He taught me
how to throw a football.

08:53.328 --> 08:55.762
He...He passed away
this year.

08:55.830 --> 08:59.031
His favorite drink
was a seven and seven.

08:59.099 --> 09:00.866
- Don't order that.
- That's an awful drink.

09:00.933 --> 09:02.067
- You're better than that.

09:02.134 --> 09:03.468
- That's a high school drink
for girls.

09:03.536 --> 09:04.769
- Actually,
I'll have a root beer

09:04.836 --> 09:06.403
Instead of that water.

09:06.471 --> 09:08.939
- Sure thing.
- Thank you kindly.

09:09.007 --> 09:12.042
Y'all are so nice
in this town.

09:12.109 --> 09:14.977
I'm caroline.
From corpus christi.

09:15.044 --> 09:18.180

♪ doo doo doo doo ♪

You score any higher
on this thing,

09:25.186 --> 09:26.419
The rylans
are gonna recruit you

09:26.487 --> 09:28.121
To fight against
the ko-dan empire.

09:28.189 --> 09:29.556
<i>- The last starfighter.</i>

09:29.624 --> 09:31.658
Did you get
the 25th anniversary blu-ray?

09:31.726 --> 09:34.494
- Was scorpius half-scarran,
half-peacekeeper?

09:34.562 --> 09:37.029
<i>Frell, yes, I got starfighter
on blu-ray.</i>

09:38.732 --> 09:42.000
<i>- You're a fan of the sci-fi
original series farscape.</i>

09:42.068 --> 09:43.634
- Can I buy you a drink?

09:50.575 --> 09:52.742
- You got some id?

09:52.809 --> 09:54.643
- Very funny, punk.

09:54.711 --> 09:56.011
Get outta my way!

09:56.079 --> 09:57.479
[muttering]
people trying to--

09:57.546 --> 10:00.314
I don't know how people like you
even get jobs today.

10:00.382 --> 10:01.749
- Hey, do you need help, man?
- Oh...

10:01.816 --> 10:03.484
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
Ha ha!

10:03.552 --> 10:05.452
A little turning
of the tables.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.719
Ha.

10:07.787 --> 10:09.454
- The turning
of what tables?

10:09.522 --> 10:10.654
- I don't know!
Leave me alone!

10:10.722 --> 10:11.822
[blows into tube]
pffttt!

10:11.889 --> 10:12.823
[bang]

10:12.890 --> 10:15.458
[crash, bang]

10:15.526 --> 10:16.993
- [exaggerated accent
so I punched her

10:17.060 --> 10:17.994
Right in the face.

10:18.061 --> 10:20.195
- Your probation officer?

10:20.263 --> 10:21.496
Didn't you get in trouble?

10:21.564 --> 10:23.465
- Hell, yes,
I got in trouble!

10:23.532 --> 10:26.167
Wasn't the first time.
Won't be the last.

10:26.234 --> 10:28.536
I'm not exactly known for
my sound judgment.

10:28.604 --> 10:32.373
Back in corpus christi, they
call me capricious caroline.

10:32.441 --> 10:34.942
- What's capricious mean?

10:35.010 --> 10:37.178
- Probably means I'm...

10:37.245 --> 10:40.848
Too busy livin' life
to be learnin' $5-words.

10:40.916 --> 10:43.651
Ha ha!
Hot damn!

10:43.719 --> 10:45.520
- With an aged scotch,
never use ice.

10:45.587 --> 10:46.888
- Never use ice.
Got it.

10:46.956 --> 10:48.956
Why?
- Destroys it.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.857
At most, what you want--
two drops of spring water.

10:51.925 --> 10:53.292
Activates the flavor.
- Good lord.

10:53.359 --> 10:56.194
Do they have the rules to
high-maintenance poser drinker

10:56.262 --> 10:57.829
On the wall at l street?

10:57.897 --> 10:59.731
- Do they?
- Poser drinking?

10:59.798 --> 11:01.932
Hey, miss vodka,
need four olives.

11:02.000 --> 11:04.001
What's that called,
the too-cool-to-care-tini?

11:04.068 --> 11:05.368
- Is it?

11:05.436 --> 11:07.570
- I bet the forced
starkness of that drink order

11:07.638 --> 11:09.872
Turns a lotta horn-rimmed heads
at the red door.

11:09.939 --> 11:12.206
- I can't wait to understand
these arguments!

11:12.274 --> 11:13.507
- Hey, y'all,
'nother round for ya.

11:13.574 --> 11:14.840
Everybody holdin' up?

11:14.908 --> 11:18.042
I'll be back in two shakes
of a rabbit's ass.

11:18.110 --> 11:19.641
- Who the hell was that?

11:21.074 --> 11:22.208
- I gotta go see a woman

11:22.275 --> 11:24.142
About the female equivalent
of a horse.

11:24.210 --> 11:26.311
- Classy.
Way to show troy the ropes.

11:26.378 --> 11:28.278
- Shut up, l street.

11:30.314 --> 11:32.215
- That woman is a hurricane.

11:32.282 --> 11:34.217
- Yeah.

11:34.285 --> 11:36.053
- Hurricanes are bad, troy.

11:36.121 --> 11:37.555
- I know.

11:41.227 --> 11:42.894
- I always thought it's possible

11:42.962 --> 11:44.695
That the wormhole
crichton fell through

11:44.763 --> 11:46.664
Moved him across not only space
but also time,

11:46.731 --> 11:48.866
Which would suggest that the
sebaceans are our future selves

11:48.933 --> 11:51.067
And crichton is longing for
a planet that no longer exists.

11:51.135 --> 11:54.470
- Ha. Hey, you're really
nursing that beer.

11:57.006 --> 11:58.340
- Ahh. Which would make sense,

11:58.408 --> 11:59.974
Because what kind of
wormhole would it be

12:00.042 --> 12:01.743
If it could only move
from one place to another

12:01.810 --> 12:03.344
Within the same galaxy
on the same day?

12:03.412 --> 12:04.745
- You know,
speaking of wormholes,

12:04.813 --> 12:07.080
Uh, whaddaya say
we use one to...

12:07.148 --> 12:10.517
Teleport this conversation
someplace a little more private?

12:10.584 --> 12:11.918
- That doesn't make any sense.

12:11.985 --> 12:14.119
Wormholes and teleportation
are two different things.

12:14.187 --> 12:16.088
That's what I've been talking
about this whole time.

12:16.155 --> 12:18.056
- I noticed.
- Cheers.

12:18.124 --> 12:20.625
- I followed that band phish--
spells it with "ph".

12:20.692 --> 12:22.793
I just lived in parking lots
wherever they played.

12:22.861 --> 12:24.028
I don't even like their music.

12:24.095 --> 12:25.362
Just did it to see
if I could do it.

12:25.430 --> 12:26.897
And guess what.
I could!

12:26.964 --> 12:28.265
- So what now?
- I dunno!

12:28.333 --> 12:30.533
Even if I planned it,
plans just fall off me

12:30.601 --> 12:33.269
Like chicken crap
off an armadilla.

12:33.337 --> 12:35.804
[chuckles] annie's the one
that plans things, not me.

12:35.872 --> 12:38.740
Annie's my friend.
She goes to school here.

12:38.808 --> 12:41.275
Thinks she's got it
all figured out.

12:41.343 --> 12:43.210
She wants to major
in healthcare management.

12:43.278 --> 12:45.245
What does that even mean?

12:45.313 --> 12:46.780
- No idea.

12:46.847 --> 12:48.281
- I'll tell you what it means.

12:48.348 --> 12:50.649
It means a master's degree
followed by an internship.

12:50.717 --> 12:52.784
She's got the next
15 years of her life

12:52.852 --> 12:54.386
All mapped out,
and all she gotta do now

12:54.453 --> 12:57.288
Is just follow it
or screw it up.

12:57.356 --> 12:58.289
- Another soda?

12:58.357 --> 13:00.491
- Actually,
gimme a screwdriver.

13:00.558 --> 13:02.492
I got no place to be.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.161
What am I...Annie?

13:05.229 --> 13:07.296
- The first season, when you
watch it the second time,

13:07.364 --> 13:09.164
Is better than the third season,
and the fourth season,

13:09.232 --> 13:10.532
When you watch it
the fifth time--

13:10.600 --> 13:12.267
- Okay. Um...
What's your name?

13:12.335 --> 13:13.268
- Abed.
- Abed, I'm robert.

13:13.336 --> 13:14.436
- Hey, robert.

13:14.504 --> 13:17.105
- Abed, would you
like to have...

13:17.173 --> 13:19.841
Gay sex...With me?

13:19.909 --> 13:22.276
- No, thank you.
- Wow.

13:22.344 --> 13:24.545
Okay, so...
What is wrong with you

13:24.612 --> 13:26.814
That you can sit here
this whole time

13:26.881 --> 13:30.283
And never pick up on the fact
that a man is hitting on you?

13:30.350 --> 13:32.117
- Oh, I actually did pick up
on it after a while.

13:32.185 --> 13:33.118
- You actually--

13:33.186 --> 13:34.353
And?

13:34.421 --> 13:36.488
<i>- I really, really like
talking about farscape.</i>

13:40.559 --> 13:42.460
It's a really good show.

13:42.528 --> 13:43.827
<i>- Stargate's better.</i>

13:46.497 --> 13:47.830

13:47.898 --> 13:49.565
Electronic voice:
Battery depleted.

13:49.632 --> 13:51.667
- Oh, man.

13:51.734 --> 13:53.835
Aw...

13:55.338 --> 13:57.072
[laughter]
- that is wrong!

13:59.074 --> 14:00.140
Wait.

14:00.208 --> 14:01.141
- Oh!

14:01.209 --> 14:02.609
- Hey, there!

14:02.676 --> 14:04.244
What you been up to?

14:04.312 --> 14:05.579
- I was just, uh,

14:05.647 --> 14:08.348
Praying for these poor souls
in these photographs.

14:08.416 --> 14:09.949
- Oh, that's nice, but, uh...

14:10.017 --> 14:11.850
You missed one.

14:11.918 --> 14:14.852
I found it
in the ladies room.

14:14.920 --> 14:16.521
- Uh...Give that to me?

14:16.588 --> 14:18.522
- No, no, come on!
Don't feel bad.

14:18.590 --> 14:21.291
This makes us like you
way more.

14:21.359 --> 14:22.759
- You think
this is really funny.

14:22.826 --> 14:23.760
- Yeah.
- Yeah, a little.

14:23.827 --> 14:26.329
- I had some bad years.

14:26.396 --> 14:27.963
With a chaser.

14:28.031 --> 14:29.331
- Come on.
It's a funny picture,

14:29.399 --> 14:31.333
Because you act so perfect
all the time.

14:31.400 --> 14:33.334
And because
you look like a zombie,

14:33.402 --> 14:35.302
But it's not funny
when you're sad.

14:35.370 --> 14:36.636
We're on your team.
Relax.

14:36.704 --> 14:38.138
Sit down.
It's my birthday.

14:38.205 --> 14:39.805
- Give it to me.

14:39.873 --> 14:40.940
Give it to me.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.442
See you all on Monday.

14:45.444 --> 14:46.877
- Sheesh.
- Oh...

14:46.945 --> 14:49.346
Britta: Blue town.

14:49.414 --> 14:51.615
Jeff: Shirley. Wait.

14:52.617 --> 14:54.017

14:54.085 --> 14:55.385
- Nothing.
Get out of my way!

14:55.453 --> 14:57.354
- I can't get out
of your way.

14:57.421 --> 14:59.789
I'm stuck in this pl--
the chair broke--

14:59.857 --> 15:02.325
I mean, I can't get--

15:02.392 --> 15:05.227
Could you p-please help me?

15:05.295 --> 15:07.963
Pretty please?

15:08.030 --> 15:09.798
Thank you, shirley.

15:09.865 --> 15:11.933
- You're welcome, jackass.

15:14.103 --> 15:16.270
- Hey, um, it's my birthday,

15:16.338 --> 15:18.171
And technically,
I'm not allowed to drink

15:18.239 --> 15:20.509
For another 45 seconds.

15:20.576 --> 15:21.910
Well, actually,
it'll be 30 seconds

15:21.978 --> 15:23.878
By the time I'm done
saying this.

15:23.946 --> 15:25.380
But can I have
a seven and seven?

15:25.447 --> 15:28.149
- It's on the house.
Happy birthday, kid.

15:32.953 --> 15:35.221
<i>Britta:
I prefer that to avatar.</i>

15:35.289 --> 15:37.823
I'd rather have my eyes

<i>Jeff: Imagine the hurt locker

15:39.725 --> 15:41.559

Jeff: Go see the other play!

15:47.399 --> 15:49.733

Big, big boy.

16:16.084 --> 16:18.520
I think I owe you
a birthday.

16:18.587 --> 16:20.154
- I'm cool.

16:20.222 --> 16:22.023
I actually always wanted
to drive this thing.

16:22.090 --> 16:24.491
- What?
Oh.

16:24.559 --> 16:26.193
This is my car?

16:26.260 --> 16:28.194
Don't crash it.
- I'm not gonna crash it!

16:28.262 --> 16:29.595
- [slurring]
crash it, troy.

16:29.663 --> 16:30.930
- Go to sleep, britta.
Go to sleep.

16:30.998 --> 16:32.598
- Crash his car, troy!

16:32.666 --> 16:35.200
- Seems like a really dark
chapter in our group story.

16:35.268 --> 16:37.635
- Go to sleep, abed.
- Cool.

16:37.703 --> 16:39.170

hey, that's the place

16:39.238 --> 16:41.172
That we shoulda
gone to tonight!

16:41.239 --> 16:42.506
- Yeah, l street.
Exactly.

16:42.574 --> 16:45.142
- It's the red door, stupid!

16:45.209 --> 16:47.477
You see a sign
that says l street?

16:47.545 --> 16:48.878
- L street is too cool
to have a sign.

16:48.946 --> 16:51.348
It's called l street
after the street it's on.

16:51.415 --> 16:52.849
- [laughs]

16:52.916 --> 16:55.184
The red door's on l street.

16:55.252 --> 16:57.553
- L street has a red door.
[both laughing]

16:57.620 --> 16:58.887
[brakes screech]

16:58.955 --> 17:00.155
- Aah!
- Hey!

17:00.223 --> 17:02.390
- It's the same bar?

17:02.458 --> 17:05.025
You two have been saying
one bar is lame

17:05.093 --> 17:08.594
And the other one is awesome
all night...

17:08.662 --> 17:11.730
<i>And it's the same bar?</i>

17:13.900 --> 17:15.935
- Well, he probably was
around Friday nights,

17:16.002 --> 17:17.203
Which was lame.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.237
- You wish!

17:18.305 --> 17:19.570
- Stop. Just stop.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.739
I just spent the last two years

17:21.807 --> 17:24.208
Thinking that you guys
knew more than me about life,

17:24.276 --> 17:27.711
And I just found out that you
guys are just as dumb as me.

17:29.280 --> 17:30.213
- Duh-doy.

17:30.281 --> 17:33.549
- Yeah. Duh-doy.

17:33.617 --> 17:35.217
- Got it.

17:35.285 --> 17:38.486
Duh-doy.

17:38.554 --> 17:39.854
Duh-doy.

17:39.922 --> 17:41.221
- You can take me home first.

17:41.289 --> 17:43.089
I only live
a few blocks from here.

17:43.157 --> 17:44.424
- You do?

17:44.491 --> 17:46.859
- Hey, this is a really
terrible neighborhood.

17:46.927 --> 17:48.227
- Yeah.

17:50.729 --> 17:53.562
- This is my apartment.

17:53.630 --> 17:55.764
Weird night, huh?

17:55.832 --> 17:58.232
- Yeah. Alcohol
makes people sad.

17:58.300 --> 18:00.701
It's like the lifetime movies
of beverages.

18:00.768 --> 18:02.903
- I pretended to be
a different person tonight.

18:02.971 --> 18:04.873
- Abed does that
like three times a week.

18:04.941 --> 18:07.343
- But I did it because
I didn't wanna be me.

18:07.411 --> 18:10.278
I-I did it because

18:10.345 --> 18:11.612
I'm not sure who I am.

18:11.680 --> 18:13.614
Admit it--we went to school
together for four years,

18:13.682 --> 18:15.716
And you didn't even
know me.

18:15.784 --> 18:18.252
- Yeah, but...
I know you now.

18:18.320 --> 18:19.720
You're annie.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.521
You like puzzles and...

18:21.589 --> 18:23.122
Little monsters
on your pencil

18:23.190 --> 18:25.157
And some guy
named mark ruffalo.

18:25.225 --> 18:28.259
You're a fierce competitor
and a sore loser.

18:28.327 --> 18:32.129
And you expect everybody
to be better than who they are

18:32.196 --> 18:35.433
And you expect yourself
to be better than everyone.

18:35.501 --> 18:37.468
Which is cool.

18:37.536 --> 18:39.336
[laughs]

18:44.875 --> 18:46.308
Good night.

18:48.611 --> 18:50.279
- Guess everyone's gonna be
pretty embarrassed

18:50.346 --> 18:51.480
On Monday, huh?

18:51.548 --> 18:54.415
- Naw. Everybody
just got a little bit drunk.

18:54.483 --> 18:56.450
Nobody did anything
that bad, right?

19:02.355 --> 19:04.289
- [slurring]
no, wait, wait, wait.

19:04.357 --> 19:06.757
What are we doing?

19:06.825 --> 19:08.726
- Yeah. What are we doing?

19:08.794 --> 19:10.895
- This is a bad idea,
right?

19:10.963 --> 19:12.730
- Yeah.

19:19.370 --> 19:21.371
- Okay.

19:23.307 --> 19:26.208
I flew off the handle
earlier.

19:26.276 --> 19:28.810
I apologize.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.013
- They were making out.

19:33.081 --> 19:34.914
- Abed!
- Abed, why would you say that?

19:34.982 --> 19:36.415
- Why would you do it
in front of me?

19:36.483 --> 19:37.850
I'm not a coat rack.

19:37.918 --> 19:39.285
- Abed.
- Mm-hmm.

19:39.352 --> 19:40.920
- No one likes a tattle tail.

19:43.156 --> 19:46.258
- Happy birthday, troy.

19:46.325 --> 19:47.826
- Thanks.

19:49.394 --> 19:51.362
- You're a man now.

20:03.489 --> 20:05.857
- I don't think
this is gonna be big enough.

20:05.925 --> 20:07.726
- Just try it--we're so close!
- All right. Breathe in.

20:07.793 --> 20:08.726
- [inhales]

20:08.794 --> 20:10.727
- All right.

20:10.795 --> 20:12.062
- [gasps]

20:12.129 --> 20:13.430
- Arms.

20:13.497 --> 20:15.164
There we go.
There we go, yeah.

20:15.232 --> 20:19.501
- Ah!
[panting]

20:19.569 --> 20:21.203
- 157!
- We did it!

20:21.271 --> 20:23.739
- Yes.
[cell phone rings]

20:23.806 --> 20:26.207
That you?
- Yeah.

20:26.275 --> 20:28.242
[ringing]
little help?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.744
Hurry.
I think it's a girl!

20:29.811 --> 20:31.745
- Left side or right side?
- Left side.

20:31.813 --> 20:33.447
- Got it.
Tell me when I'm clo.

20:33.515 --> 20:34.414
- Okay.
