00:01.555 --> 00:02.889
Previously on Angel from Hell:

00:02.891 --> 00:05.040
- Oh!
- I'm so sorry.

00:05.079 --> 00:07.150
No worries. Accidents happen.

00:07.177 --> 00:10.132
I'll bet you're a very
sweet person, Dr. Allison.

00:10.264 --> 00:11.397
How did you know my name?

00:11.399 --> 00:13.399
It's me, Amy,
from the farmers' market.

00:13.401 --> 00:14.600
Who's this Bit-O-Honey?

00:14.602 --> 00:15.934
I'm Brad. I'm the brother.

00:15.936 --> 00:18.103
Your mother died 412 days ago,

00:18.105 --> 00:19.437
and since then,
you've buried yourself

00:19.439 --> 00:20.838
<i>in work,</i>

00:20.840 --> 00:22.173
<i>buried yourself
in a relationship.</i>

00:22.175 --> 00:23.841
How do you know all that stuff?

00:23.843 --> 00:27.205
Honey, I'm your guardian angel.

00:27.414 --> 00:30.014
<i>He's working on boning
your best friend.</i>

00:30.016 --> 00:32.249
- Evan and I hooked up.
- Ugh.

00:32.250 --> 00:35.285
It's not that I believe
you're an angel.

00:35.287 --> 00:37.521
- But?
- I could use a weird friend.

00:37.523 --> 00:38.922
Do they come any weirder?

00:38.924 --> 00:40.524
(chuckling)

00:42.860 --> 00:46.396
To Allison... third anniversary
of joining my practice.

00:46.398 --> 00:48.131
You make Fuller Dermatology

00:48.133 --> 00:49.533
- a little fuller.
- I wrote that.

00:49.535 --> 00:50.800
His idea. I made it sing.

00:50.802 --> 00:51.967
Well, thank you both.

00:51.969 --> 00:53.302
This is really sweet.

00:53.304 --> 00:54.870
And I have the perfect way
to celebrate this.

00:54.872 --> 00:57.105
Come with me on a two-night,

00:57.107 --> 01:00.643
all-inclusive stay at one
of L.A.'s finest beach hotels.

01:00.645 --> 01:02.645
Classic bro-sis resort getaway.

01:02.647 --> 01:05.047
- Sounds a little romantic.
- It was supposed to be.

01:05.049 --> 01:06.782
I booked it about a year ago
with the ex-wife.

01:06.784 --> 01:08.650
And much like her, they won't
give me my money back.

01:08.652 --> 01:11.085
Well, shoot, I'm busy...
not dating my brother.

01:11.087 --> 01:12.887
I'm also swamped at the office.

01:12.889 --> 01:14.556
Don't even ask me, Bradley.

01:14.558 --> 01:17.492
You and me and a beach hotel?

01:17.494 --> 01:19.627
Not enough water in the ocean
to put out that fire.

01:19.629 --> 01:21.596
And the surface of the earth
is 75% water.

01:21.598 --> 01:24.231
Oh, now I'm just stating facts
with a sexy voice.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.566
- Hello, Amy.
- Hey, Allison.

01:25.568 --> 01:27.233
Marvin.

01:27.235 --> 01:29.235
- Not touching me also an option.
- Okay.

01:29.237 --> 01:30.571
So, what brings you
to our private

01:30.573 --> 01:32.573
- family lunch?
- Relax. I'm not crashing.

01:32.575 --> 01:34.975
Allison told me all about
your little celebration

01:34.977 --> 01:37.243
for Fuller Face Fixers, DDS...

01:37.245 --> 01:38.912
None of that's right.

01:38.914 --> 01:41.614
And I wanted to, uh, give
this gift to you in person.

01:41.616 --> 01:42.782
Oh.

01:42.784 --> 01:44.183
Oh. Wow.

01:44.185 --> 01:46.586
- Thank you so much...
- Mmm.

01:46.588 --> 01:49.321
For this... piece of paper.

01:49.323 --> 01:50.823
It's a tracking number.

01:50.825 --> 01:52.324
Well, a gift
really wasn't necessary.

01:52.326 --> 01:54.760
Nor does it seem
like an actual gift.

01:54.762 --> 01:58.763
Especially considering the
tracking number is "867-5309,"

01:58.765 --> 02:01.432
which everyone knows
is Jenny's number.

02:01.434 --> 02:02.934
I ordered you
a little something online,

02:02.936 --> 02:05.436
but the package is being
held up in New Orleans.

02:05.438 --> 02:07.205
Oh, is this a picture

02:07.207 --> 02:09.273
- of little Allison?
- Allison: Yep. That's me

02:09.275 --> 02:11.376
as a little kid,
dressed up like a doctor.

02:11.378 --> 02:13.177
Oh, and in Marv's lab coat

02:13.179 --> 02:15.480
that almost fits your tiny
eight-year-old body.

02:15.482 --> 02:17.147
(chuckles) Sorry, Dad.

02:17.149 --> 02:18.616
It's okay.

02:18.618 --> 02:20.183
- We're about to have some cake.
- Great.

02:20.185 --> 02:21.952
- Exactly three slices.
- Oh.

02:21.954 --> 02:23.821
Hint received, Cranky Pants.

02:23.823 --> 02:26.690
Well, Allison, I will, uh,
check you out back at the casa.

02:26.692 --> 02:28.458
Amy out.

02:28.460 --> 02:30.160
So we didn't really get a chance

02:30.162 --> 02:31.662
to talk about
work stuff at lunch.

02:31.664 --> 02:33.029
I'm all ears.

02:33.031 --> 02:34.831
Well, what do you think
about my proposal

02:34.833 --> 02:36.232
for updating
the computer office system?

02:36.234 --> 02:37.400
I'll have to think
about that one.

02:37.402 --> 02:38.467
That's what you said last time.

02:38.469 --> 02:39.836
Is this still about the MP3s?

02:39.838 --> 02:41.671
I lost all my
Dave Matthews albums

02:41.673 --> 02:43.172
when I digitized from CD.

02:43.174 --> 02:45.141
Dad, Dave Matthews
was popular 20 years ago.

02:45.143 --> 02:46.743
It's time to find a new band

02:46.745 --> 02:48.578
you're too old
to be listening to.

02:48.580 --> 02:49.645
(bell dings)

02:49.647 --> 02:51.179
And did you get my memo

02:51.181 --> 02:52.414
about the Nancy
and Dave situation?

02:52.416 --> 02:53.582
It's harmless.

02:53.584 --> 02:54.750
Our receptionist is calling

02:54.752 --> 02:56.151
our male nurse
Sergeant Bubble Butt.

02:56.153 --> 02:57.819
Hey, he served our country.

02:57.821 --> 03:00.989
And apparently was decorated
for his killer caboose.

03:00.991 --> 03:02.691
Okay, we don't want a lawsuit.

03:02.693 --> 03:04.526
Maybe we should
bring in a lawyer

03:04.528 --> 03:06.261
to conduct a sexual
harassment seminar?

03:06.263 --> 03:07.728
Let me think about that one.

03:07.730 --> 03:09.764
Okay, one last thing...
The office parties.

03:09.766 --> 03:12.232
- You don't like ice cream cake?
- No, I think you like them

03:12.234 --> 03:14.101
and you look for every
little excuse to have one.

03:14.103 --> 03:15.670
Ice cream cakes
are good for morale.

03:15.672 --> 03:17.104
Yeah, but they take up
a lot of time

03:17.106 --> 03:18.439
and they keep
the patients waiting.

03:18.441 --> 03:19.941
You can't change
everything at once.

03:19.943 --> 03:21.075
Okay, well, maybe we can just

03:21.077 --> 03:22.342
limit the parties
to once a week?

03:22.344 --> 03:23.777
That's gonna be a problem,

03:23.779 --> 03:25.612
because...

03:26.681 --> 03:29.182
All: Happy third anniversary.

03:29.184 --> 03:31.284
Thank you.
We're doing this again?

03:31.286 --> 03:34.353
I know I am.
Dave, cut me a slice.

03:34.355 --> 03:37.256
You sure something that hot
should be so close to ice cream?

03:37.258 --> 03:38.792
Oh, Nancy, stop.

03:44.097 --> 03:45.564
Amy: Hey there.

03:45.566 --> 03:47.299
I saw your kitchen light was on.

03:47.301 --> 03:48.767
(sighs)

03:48.769 --> 03:51.303
Sorry about barging in
on your lunch today.

03:51.305 --> 03:53.038
Yeah, that would feel
more sincere

03:53.040 --> 03:55.207
if you didn't say it
while barging in.

03:55.209 --> 03:57.233
Can we talk about boundaries?

03:57.299 --> 03:58.442
Yes, please.

03:58.444 --> 04:00.612
- I need to be around you more.
- You can't keep showing up everywhere.

04:00.614 --> 04:04.248
I'm finding it very hard to
guardian-angel you from afar.

04:04.250 --> 04:05.717
I know what the problem is.

04:05.719 --> 04:07.652
You're not an angel.

04:07.654 --> 04:09.988
Said the woman who believes
in the theory of relativity.

04:09.990 --> 04:11.555
Listen, I'm gonna...

04:11.557 --> 04:14.258
I'm gonna talk some hard science
with you, okay?

04:14.260 --> 04:17.094
Angeling is like
an FM radio station.

04:17.096 --> 04:18.728
I get messages

04:18.731 --> 04:20.497
loud and clear when I'm near you

04:20.499 --> 04:22.666
but not so much
when I'm far away.

04:22.668 --> 04:24.234
Does it have an off button?

04:24.236 --> 04:26.970
And I got a big old message
at that lunch today.

04:26.972 --> 04:28.972
Segue way alert. How are
things in the office

04:28.974 --> 04:30.607
- with your dad?
- Make your point.

04:30.609 --> 04:32.642
Your father treats you
like a daughter there,

04:32.644 --> 04:34.243
not like a partner.

04:34.245 --> 04:35.778
That's a pretty intense theory
for someone

04:35.780 --> 04:37.513
who's been there once
to use the bathroom.

04:37.515 --> 04:39.115
Does he listen to your ideas?

04:39.117 --> 04:40.683
You mentioned to me
that you've been trying

04:40.685 --> 04:42.251
to get him to update the
computer systems for months.

04:42.253 --> 04:44.153
Well, he said he was
thinking about it.

04:44.155 --> 04:45.755
Classic dad deflection.

04:45.757 --> 04:47.489
"Can we have a pony"

04:47.491 --> 04:49.423
"Well, let me think about that one"

04:49.425 --> 04:51.526
And how is that pony, huh?
I haven't seen it.

04:51.528 --> 04:53.261
Where is it?
You keep it off-site?

04:53.263 --> 04:55.263
He will never treat
you like a partner

04:55.265 --> 04:57.699
unless you take action.

04:57.701 --> 04:59.868
And your first step...

04:59.870 --> 05:01.870
Hire me to update your
computer systems.

05:01.872 --> 05:04.105
- No.
- Why not? It's a nobrainer.

05:04.107 --> 05:05.540
I think you are a lovely person.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.507
- And I think you're amazing.
- But... that said,

05:07.509 --> 05:09.877
you don't strike me
as the office type.

05:09.879 --> 05:12.345
And I'm not just
saying that because

05:12.347 --> 05:14.715
you're three fingers deep
into my peanut butter.

05:14.717 --> 05:17.651
Plus, you know, there's the
whole no-qualifications thing.

05:17.653 --> 05:19.953
Hmm. What you need
is a column-oriented

05:19.955 --> 05:22.355
DBMS database...

05:22.357 --> 05:24.390
Properly hashed and
salted, of course...

05:24.392 --> 05:26.125
Secured with
a 256-bit encryption...

05:26.127 --> 05:29.880
Oh, I'm sorry. Am I overwhelming
your tiny human brain?

05:29.946 --> 05:30.396
My...

05:30.398 --> 05:32.531
Here, let me show you
a Web site I built

05:32.533 --> 05:34.366
for my massage practice,

05:34.368 --> 05:35.868
Touched by an Angel.

05:35.870 --> 05:37.469
(chuckles) Here you go.

05:38.538 --> 05:39.971
Wow.

05:40.574 --> 05:42.674
This is exactly
what I'm looking for.

05:42.676 --> 05:44.743
Uh, without the
adult banner ads.

05:44.745 --> 05:46.244
Yeah, be careful
where you click.

05:46.246 --> 05:47.645
Okay.

05:47.647 --> 05:49.915
So, we have a deal?

05:49.917 --> 05:51.216
I'll talk to my dad about it.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.517
Look, I'll come into the office,

05:52.519 --> 05:54.886
and I'll set up a
demo... for free.

05:54.888 --> 05:57.254
It'll only take a day.
There's literally no downside.

05:57.256 --> 05:59.389
(groans)
Oh, come on.

05:59.391 --> 06:01.592
What's your dad gonna do,
send you to your room?

06:04.563 --> 06:06.430
Good morning, Dr. Fuller.

06:06.432 --> 06:08.365
Amy Cass reporting for duty.

06:08.367 --> 06:09.666
(laughing)

06:09.668 --> 06:12.103
Where are the cameras? Huh?

06:12.657 --> 06:14.938
Sweet Lord,
let there be cameras.

06:14.940 --> 06:16.773
Dad, we should talk.

06:16.775 --> 06:19.609
Nancy, I'm gonna need a coffee
and a Klonopin.

06:19.611 --> 06:20.944
Ooh. Sounds good.

06:20.946 --> 06:23.012
Make that two, Nance.

06:23.014 --> 06:24.754
S01E04
Family Business

06:24.755 --> 06:27.392
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:29.274 --> 06:31.548
You two are showing
a lot of faith,

06:31.653 --> 06:33.777
letting me do this, and
just know I will never be

06:33.879 --> 06:35.912
anything less than
professional here at the...

06:35.914 --> 06:38.546
Fuller Family Skin House.

06:38.559 --> 06:41.356
(laughing): Not even close.
It's Fuller Dermatology.

06:41.485 --> 06:42.992
You can check the
sign on your way out.

06:43.032 --> 06:43.929
Amy, can you give us a second?

06:44.021 --> 06:46.026
Yeah, oh, absolutely.
Yeah, I'll just set stuff up.

06:46.079 --> 06:48.085
Yeah. Don't back down.

06:48.592 --> 06:50.257
I thought we decided to table

06:50.259 --> 06:51.884
- a discussion of a new system.
- No, you decided that.

06:51.928 --> 06:53.661
I've been trying
to change it for forever.

06:53.663 --> 06:54.984
The system is 15 years old.

06:55.076 --> 06:57.832
I know.
Had a cake for it last week.

06:57.834 --> 06:59.533
Your answer is bringing in

06:59.535 --> 07:01.092
the vested giraffe
from the wild?

07:01.119 --> 07:03.070
She's actually really qualified.

07:03.072 --> 07:04.338
(heavy metal blasting
over speakers)

07:04.340 --> 07:05.506
(snaps fingers)

07:05.508 --> 07:07.040
Oh.

07:08.009 --> 07:09.009
(music stops)

07:09.011 --> 07:10.344
- My bad.
- (sighs) Dad.

07:10.423 --> 07:12.146
Give me a sec. I'm just
letting my heart settle.

07:12.148 --> 07:13.180
There's literally no downside.

07:13.182 --> 07:14.515
She's doing it for free.

07:14.517 --> 07:16.382
Still seems expensive.
I'm sorry.

07:16.384 --> 07:19.452
Putting in a whole new system
is not something you jump into.

07:19.454 --> 07:20.954
So we give her the day
to set up the demo.

07:20.956 --> 07:22.188
If we like what she does,
we hire her

07:22.190 --> 07:23.189
to finish the project.

07:23.191 --> 07:24.390
Okay.

07:24.392 --> 07:25.859
- Okay.
- Sure.

07:25.861 --> 07:27.127
Great!

07:28.362 --> 07:29.562
You're in.

07:29.564 --> 07:31.397
I will do you proud.

07:31.399 --> 07:34.967
Quick question: When do I get
my employee prescription pad?

07:34.969 --> 07:36.736
(heavy metal blasting
over headphones)

07:36.738 --> 07:38.004
Sorry I'm late.

07:38.006 --> 07:39.204
One of those days.

07:39.206 --> 07:40.806
You know what your sister did?

07:40.808 --> 07:42.474
She hired that crazy
friend of hers, Amy,

07:42.476 --> 07:43.709
to work at the office.

07:43.711 --> 07:45.044
That woman
is suddenly everywhere.

07:45.046 --> 07:46.345
She just sort of dropped
into her life

07:46.347 --> 07:47.479
like a sexual Mary Poppins.

07:47.481 --> 07:49.413
It's going to be a disaster.

07:49.415 --> 07:51.149
Eh, maybe some good

07:51.151 --> 07:52.651
will come from it,
like your sister

07:52.653 --> 07:53.885
will finally learn
there's a reason

07:53.887 --> 07:55.386
that I make most
of the decisions.

07:55.388 --> 07:56.655
Right, 'cause you're the dad.

07:56.657 --> 07:57.856
Father knows best.

07:57.858 --> 07:59.190
You got to be in charge.

07:59.192 --> 08:01.192
- It's not about that.
- Dad...

08:01.194 --> 08:02.894
I grew up with you.
It's not easy

08:02.896 --> 08:04.763
being around a dad
who has to control everything.

08:04.765 --> 08:06.664
I wrote your college essay
about that.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.565
Why don't you try stepping back,
letting Allison have a voice.

08:08.567 --> 08:10.200
Maybe take some time off.

08:10.202 --> 08:12.069
I don't know, maybe starting
tomorrow or something.

08:12.071 --> 08:13.904
- I'm not going to the hotel with you.
- Come on, please, Dad.

08:13.906 --> 08:15.773
It's two days.
I'm not dating anyone.

08:15.775 --> 08:17.841
None of my buddies are free.
I don't want to be that weirdo

08:17.843 --> 08:19.276
at the hotel restaurant
reading a book by himself.

08:19.278 --> 08:21.679
You've always had
an issue about being alone.

08:21.681 --> 08:23.680
Yeah. Ever since
we went snorkeling.

08:23.682 --> 08:24.914
I still feel bad about that.

08:24.916 --> 08:26.215
You drove the boat away.

08:26.217 --> 08:28.051
(laughing): That joke got away from me.

08:29.920 --> 08:32.955
I just didn't think
I'd lose you on the horizon.

08:32.957 --> 08:34.756
More tea.

08:34.759 --> 08:36.759
And, finally, let's say
that Marv is a patient

08:36.760 --> 08:38.260
and he has an appointment.

08:38.261 --> 08:39.760
(cell phone chimes)

08:39.763 --> 08:42.030
"Reminder. You have
a 10:15 a.m. appointment

08:42.032 --> 08:44.198
on Friday
for a shin lengthening."

08:44.201 --> 08:46.467
Amy (laughing):
Just a crowd pleaser.

08:46.469 --> 08:47.769
And you would text "Y"

08:47.771 --> 08:49.771
to confirm. (phone chimes)

08:49.773 --> 08:51.807
Marv: Huh.

08:51.809 --> 08:54.710
It also automatically sends
a reminder to doctors

08:54.712 --> 08:57.277
15 minutes before
each appointment.

08:57.279 --> 08:59.814
Welcome to 2016, people.

08:59.816 --> 09:01.315
Nancy, better for you?

09:01.317 --> 09:03.217
Will this give me more
time to look at Dave?

09:03.219 --> 09:05.720
Yeah, we should all have
more time to look at Dave.

09:05.722 --> 09:07.988
I like her. (Amy chuckles)

09:07.990 --> 09:12.727
I could set the whole thing up
in a week for, say, $35,000.

09:12.729 --> 09:14.127
- Nope.
- 800 bucks?

09:14.129 --> 09:15.394
So there's some

09:15.396 --> 09:16.996
wiggle room there in the price?

09:16.998 --> 09:19.799
Dad, can we let Amy convert
everything to the new system?

09:19.801 --> 09:21.334
- I'll think about that one.
- Dad!

09:21.336 --> 09:23.569
It's a no-brainer.
This is exactly what we need.

09:23.571 --> 09:25.504
I said I'll think about it.

09:25.506 --> 09:27.640
I-I'm tired of thinking
about it.

09:27.642 --> 09:29.609
We've been thinking
about it for six months.

09:29.611 --> 09:31.009
Let's just do it.

09:31.011 --> 09:33.345
- Amy, you're hired.
- Hey-o!

09:33.347 --> 09:35.147
- No, you're not.
- Standing by.

09:35.149 --> 09:37.182
You can't make
hiring decisions without me.

09:37.184 --> 09:39.084
Why not? You make them
without me all the time.

09:39.086 --> 09:40.753
That's because I know
what's best around here.

09:40.755 --> 09:43.155
I've been running the practice
for 25 years.

09:43.157 --> 09:44.823
Yeah, and it shows.
In three years,

09:44.825 --> 09:46.691
you haven't listened
to a single one of my ideas.

09:46.693 --> 09:48.492
All right, let's not do this
in front of the staff.

09:48.494 --> 09:50.294
I'll tell you what...
Why don't you go to your office

09:50.296 --> 09:52.496
- and relax a little bit?
- What?

09:52.498 --> 09:55.266
Are you actually
sending me to my room?

09:56.769 --> 09:58.936
You really do see me
as a daughter around here

09:58.938 --> 10:00.204
and not a partner.

10:00.206 --> 10:02.039
I could make
so many great changes

10:02.041 --> 10:03.775
if you would just step back.

10:03.777 --> 10:05.308
(chuckling):
All right, you know what?

10:05.310 --> 10:07.543
I'm gonna go
to the hotel with Brad.

10:07.545 --> 10:09.045
I'm gonna leave the
office in your hands

10:09.047 --> 10:10.713
- for the rest of the week.
- Mmm.

10:10.715 --> 10:12.816
You should make as many
changes as you'd like.

10:12.818 --> 10:14.417
Oh, there's gonna be changes.

10:17.121 --> 10:18.388
Hey, do you mind?

10:18.390 --> 10:20.290
Personal finances.

10:20.292 --> 10:22.958
NASDAQ's going crazy.

10:25.295 --> 10:27.129
- Not the time.
- Okay.

10:32.917 --> 10:33.874
Day one.

10:33.940 --> 10:36.249
The reign of Allison...
I am so excited.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.070
Me, too. My dad is gonna see

10:38.191 --> 10:39.957
some serious changes
when he gets back.

10:39.959 --> 10:42.025
Well, it's a big day
and I'd get you a present,

10:42.027 --> 10:44.127
but I already got you that thing
for the third anniversary.

10:44.129 --> 10:45.963
Right, the piece of paper.

10:45.965 --> 10:47.130
Yeah, tracking number.

10:47.132 --> 10:48.865
What's with all the stuff?

10:48.867 --> 10:51.134
It's for my work area. Too much?

10:51.136 --> 10:53.203
So, what's the day one agenda?

10:53.205 --> 10:54.805
Chair races? B-day party?
Strippergrams?

10:54.807 --> 10:56.739
There's always strippergrams,
right?

10:56.741 --> 10:59.308
I am so regretting asking you
this after I've hired you,

10:59.310 --> 11:01.711
but have you ever worked
in an office before?

11:01.713 --> 11:03.212
Nope, but in preparation,

11:03.214 --> 11:04.947
I did watch <i>Wolf of Wall Street.</i>

11:04.949 --> 11:07.249
And I am super psyched.

11:07.251 --> 11:08.751
And a little baked.

11:08.753 --> 11:10.720
We're not pee-testing today,
are we?

11:13.555 --> 11:15.123
I'm so glad
you reconsidered, Dad.

11:15.125 --> 11:17.225
We've never done
an actual dudes' trip before.

11:17.227 --> 11:20.161
And the streak will continue.

11:20.163 --> 11:22.764
Looks like they did not get my
note to de-romanticize the room.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.265
All right, we need to get
rid of these rose petals,

11:24.267 --> 11:27.102
and our beach towels
shouldn't be kissing.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.770
I'm just gonna check
with Nancy at the office.

11:28.772 --> 11:30.170
Put that phone away.

11:30.172 --> 11:32.205
You are on vacation.
Allison is covering.

11:32.270 --> 11:33.941
Let her do her thing.
Let us do ours.

11:33.943 --> 11:34.975
Ow!
(chuckles)

11:35.978 --> 11:37.144
Why?

11:37.146 --> 11:38.245
Locker room high jinks.

11:38.247 --> 11:40.014
It started.

11:40.016 --> 11:41.581
Oh, that's right,
we get a bunch of, uh,

11:41.583 --> 11:42.983
activities with our package...
Let's see here.

11:42.985 --> 11:44.652
Shall we start bro-ing out

11:44.654 --> 11:46.753
with a little bit of (grunts)
mixed doubles tennis?

11:46.755 --> 11:49.488
Lovers' wine and cheese tasting
in the botanical garden?

11:49.490 --> 11:51.090
These are all pretty much
couples-oriented.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.792
Although the yoga
looks relaxing.

11:52.794 --> 11:54.794
Hey, why don't we just start
with a couple of drinks?

11:54.796 --> 11:56.863
I want to toast my boy
getting me out of the office.

11:56.865 --> 11:58.931
I like where your head's at.

11:58.933 --> 12:00.266
See what they got here.

12:00.268 --> 12:01.534
Get this party started

12:01.536 --> 12:04.870
with some raspberry
champagne-skis.

12:04.872 --> 12:06.838
Let me go get
some whiskey and a cot.

12:06.840 --> 12:09.440
They didn't listen
to anything I told them!

12:10.222 --> 12:12.778
Wow, you've really decked out
your workspace with a lot of...

12:12.780 --> 12:15.213
dolphin pictures.

12:15.215 --> 12:17.448
I just love them.
I don't know why.

12:17.450 --> 12:20.603
I was a dolphin angel
in my last life.

12:20.683 --> 12:22.687
All right, carry on.
Also I need you to transfer

12:22.689 --> 12:24.188
all of my appointments
into the calendar

12:24.190 --> 12:25.222
before the end of the day.

12:25.224 --> 12:26.390
By the end of today?

12:26.392 --> 12:27.958
Well, that would take a miracle.

12:27.960 --> 12:29.459
Isn't that
what you claim you do?

12:29.461 --> 12:31.128
Touché. You know you don't have

12:31.130 --> 12:32.963
to make all these
changes at once?

12:32.965 --> 12:34.331
Thanks for the input,

12:34.333 --> 12:36.000
- but Mama Bear's got a plan.
- Yeah.

12:36.002 --> 12:37.834
All right, everybody,
gather around, yep.

12:37.836 --> 12:39.468
I've got a little surprise.

12:39.470 --> 12:41.004
Great, what are we celebrating?

12:41.006 --> 12:43.573
Well, we are celebrating
our increased awareness

12:43.575 --> 12:46.497
of liability
and responsibility to each other

12:46.629 --> 12:48.644
with a sexual harassment
seminar.

12:48.646 --> 12:51.915
Yeah, a lawyer is going
to come here from a local firm,

12:51.917 --> 12:54.317
and he's gonna go over what is
and is not appropriate

12:54.319 --> 12:56.018
in the workplace.

12:56.020 --> 12:57.686
Oh, I know what this is.

12:57.688 --> 13:00.555
This is a surprise for me
for my first day of work.

13:00.557 --> 13:04.226
Now, would this lawyer's name
happen to be S. Tripper?

13:04.228 --> 13:05.828
Stripper?

13:05.830 --> 13:07.162
A little morale boost
for the troops?

13:07.164 --> 13:08.563
Oh, so <i>Wolf of Wall Street.</i>

13:08.565 --> 13:09.698
I love that movie.
(coworkers clamoring)

13:09.700 --> 13:10.699
Guys, no.

13:10.701 --> 13:12.266
He's a real lawyer.

13:12.268 --> 13:15.169
And his area of expertise
is sexual harassment.

13:15.171 --> 13:16.704
Is exactly the kind
of thing you'd say

13:16.706 --> 13:18.405
before he starts stripping.

13:18.407 --> 13:19.673
Enough! Robert.

13:19.675 --> 13:21.242
Hi. Thank you for coming.

13:21.244 --> 13:23.010
Floor is yours.

13:23.012 --> 13:24.779
Hello, everyone.
Uh, I'm just gonna get started.

13:24.781 --> 13:27.581
Uh, I'm gonna give a little
presentation today on how

13:27.583 --> 13:30.350
to make the workplace a safe
and comfortable environment.

13:30.352 --> 13:32.385
It's a little warm in here, huh?

13:32.387 --> 13:34.121
It's happening.

13:34.123 --> 13:35.521
What's happening?

13:35.523 --> 13:36.957
Nothing. Nothing is happening.

13:36.959 --> 13:38.959
I'm sorry, Robert.
Please continue.

13:38.961 --> 13:41.527
All right, well,
let's get this party started.

13:41.529 --> 13:43.296
Nancy: Is just the kind of thing

13:43.298 --> 13:46.531
every stripper says
before he takes it off!

13:46.533 --> 13:48.234
It's an unfortunate
turn of phrase.

13:48.236 --> 13:51.137
Yeah! Take it off!

13:51.139 --> 13:53.005
(coworkers clamoring)

13:54.875 --> 13:56.408
Are you kidding me with this?

13:56.410 --> 13:57.877
Is everything in this hotel
covered in rose petals?

13:57.879 --> 13:59.245
That's just bougainvillea.

13:59.247 --> 14:00.712
Hey, there, you two.

14:00.714 --> 14:02.148
We're scheduled to
play against you.

14:02.150 --> 14:03.614
We're the Fullers.

14:03.616 --> 14:05.083
Well, go easy on us.

14:05.085 --> 14:07.618
This is my first time
playing with the new knee.

14:07.620 --> 14:08.887
The new knee. (chuckles)

14:08.889 --> 14:11.579
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

14:15.996 --> 14:18.496
(melodic harmonizing)

14:20.064 --> 14:22.465
Let's call a switch-out.

14:22.467 --> 14:23.600
Can we be communicating, please?

14:23.602 --> 14:24.768
Really?

14:24.770 --> 14:27.905
(melodic harmonizing)

14:27.907 --> 14:30.274
Oh, come on!

14:30.276 --> 14:32.276
Where were you
on that one, buddy?

14:33.007 --> 14:35.578
I need you. I need you here.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.013
♪ She said, "My boy,
it's Dagger" ♪

14:37.015 --> 14:39.682
♪ Oh, yeah, whoa!

14:39.684 --> 14:41.617
♪ I was good, she was hot...

14:41.619 --> 14:43.519
My God, have you been
working all night?

14:43.521 --> 14:44.620
How many bottles of...?

14:44.622 --> 14:46.155
I drank 85 hours of energy.

14:46.157 --> 14:47.423
Why?

14:47.425 --> 14:49.425
You told me you wanted
this done.

14:49.427 --> 14:51.327
And I wanted to pull off
a miracle for you.

14:51.329 --> 14:52.661
And now I can say...

14:52.663 --> 14:53.995
And I don't think this phrase

14:53.997 --> 14:55.297
has ever backfired before...

14:55.299 --> 14:56.464
Mission accomplished.

14:56.466 --> 14:57.532
(gasps)

15:00.049 --> 15:01.669
Changes are happening, people.

15:01.671 --> 15:03.604
Okay, Amy,

15:04.310 --> 15:05.941
show us the magic.

15:07.265 --> 15:08.310
Amy?

15:08.312 --> 15:10.045
- Yes, Allison?
- I have no patients.

15:10.047 --> 15:11.846
I know, and it's
a character flaw.

15:11.848 --> 15:14.648
That's why I had to stay
all night to get this done.

15:14.650 --> 15:16.350
No, I have no <i>patients...</i>
People coming in.

15:16.352 --> 15:18.352
I have nothing
on my calendar today.

15:18.354 --> 15:20.620
In fact, oh, our
entire month is clear.

15:20.622 --> 15:22.556
- What?
- What have you done?

15:22.558 --> 15:24.124
Well, I'm sorry, I don't,
I don't know what happened.

15:24.126 --> 15:25.659
Maybe, uh, I lost
all the appointments

15:25.661 --> 15:27.061
when I migrated the system...

15:27.063 --> 15:29.329
I thought you said you knew
what you were doing.

15:29.331 --> 15:31.564
It looks like there's
one appointment

15:31.566 --> 15:34.067
on the calendar at 10:15.

15:34.069 --> 15:35.201
Let's see who it is.

15:35.203 --> 15:37.036
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

15:37.038 --> 15:38.239
What the hell?

15:38.292 --> 15:39.901
Well, I didn't erase
the appointments,

15:39.954 --> 15:41.841
I just accidentally
moved them all

15:41.843 --> 15:43.910
to Friday at 10:15.

15:43.912 --> 15:45.510
In six minutes.

15:45.512 --> 15:47.079
It's a super appointment.

15:47.081 --> 15:48.981
(door handle jiggling)

15:50.000 --> 15:56.074

15:58.091 --> 16:00.058
See you guys on the other side.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.593
Of the partition.

16:01.595 --> 16:03.127
I'll be up front.

16:07.652 --> 16:09.186
Great win, guys, great win.

16:09.188 --> 16:11.853
And happy 40th anniversary.
(chuckles)

16:13.909 --> 16:14.754
I don't know what
happened out there.

16:14.859 --> 16:16.915
Oh, I have an idea...
Maybe it's because you

16:16.959 --> 16:18.592
stole every shot of mine.
I'm supposed to do one side

16:18.594 --> 16:19.960
and you're supposed
to do the other.

16:19.962 --> 16:20.995
Don't you know
how doubles works?

16:20.997 --> 16:22.729
I normally play singles.

16:22.731 --> 16:24.896
Yeah, I can tell.
You're a terrible partner.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.968
I'm a terrible partner.

16:27.970 --> 16:29.335
I mean, it's okay.
It's just tennis.

16:29.337 --> 16:30.736
- But, yeah.
- No, no.

16:30.738 --> 16:32.238
It's 100% true.

16:35.186 --> 16:37.110
This cannot be right.

16:37.112 --> 16:38.511
Hey, listen up, folks.

16:38.513 --> 16:40.579
I just want to apologize
for the wait

16:40.581 --> 16:43.349
on behalf of Fuller Brothers
Hematology.

16:43.351 --> 16:45.018
And that is not
the name of this office.

16:45.020 --> 16:46.751
Why can't I get that right?

16:46.753 --> 16:48.753
Okay, who likes magic, huh?

16:48.755 --> 16:50.255
Can you make my rash disappear?

16:50.257 --> 16:52.757
No, but I do see a quarter be...

16:52.759 --> 16:55.660
Wow, that looks super infected.

16:55.662 --> 16:57.329
Allison, this dude
needs to go next.

16:57.331 --> 16:58.830
No, Amy, I have
to go alphabetically.

16:58.832 --> 16:59.964
Oh, oh, God!

16:59.966 --> 17:01.433
Jeremy, come with me.

17:01.435 --> 17:03.467
(patients clamoring
in frustration)

17:03.469 --> 17:05.202
This is a disaster.

17:05.204 --> 17:07.771
Don't worry, your
angel's got a plan.

17:07.772 --> 17:09.006
Don't touch the fire alarm.

17:09.008 --> 17:11.075
Your angel does not have a plan.

17:11.077 --> 17:12.542
Holy crap.

17:12.545 --> 17:14.645
Oh, I am so glad
you're here, Dad.

17:14.646 --> 17:15.811
This is all my fault.

17:15.814 --> 17:17.647
We'll talk about that later.

17:17.650 --> 17:19.416
Right now, we just need to get
through these patients, okay?

17:19.419 --> 17:20.816
What do you think... you take
this half of the waiting room

17:20.818 --> 17:22.585
and I'll take the other.

17:22.587 --> 17:23.653
Sounds like a plan.

17:23.655 --> 17:24.654
Paul Bunyan's sister,

17:24.656 --> 17:26.021
go to the freezer,

17:26.023 --> 17:27.757
get me the emergency
ice cream cake, stat!

17:27.759 --> 17:29.806
Everybody gets a piece.

17:30.428 --> 17:32.228
Is there just the one emergency,

17:32.230 --> 17:33.829
uh, ice cream cake?

17:33.831 --> 17:36.299
Because someone might've
eaten it last night.

17:40.201 --> 17:41.002
Hey.

17:41.004 --> 17:42.538
Sorry to bother you.

17:42.540 --> 17:43.939
I just wanted to say
I love that book.

17:43.941 --> 17:45.374
Good to know.

17:45.376 --> 17:47.176
Uh, to be honest,
I felt so weird

17:47.178 --> 17:49.178
about reading alone, I just
sort of opened it to the middle.

17:49.180 --> 17:51.180
But I'm piecing
some things together.

17:51.182 --> 17:52.881
And I got to tell you,

17:52.883 --> 17:54.508
I'm kind of enjoying
being alone.

17:54.666 --> 17:56.684
Okay, cool.

17:56.686 --> 17:58.119
Cool. (chuckles)

18:00.789 --> 18:03.591
She was totally flirting
with me, wasn't she?

18:03.593 --> 18:05.859
- Big-time.
- Yeah.

18:06.424 --> 18:08.696
I've been out of the game
for a little while, so...

18:08.698 --> 18:10.198
I haven't whacked
that many moles

18:10.200 --> 18:12.299
since your ninth birthday party
at Chuck E. Cheese.

18:12.301 --> 18:13.866
How long you been working
on that one?

18:13.868 --> 18:15.768
Since Mrs. Nussbaum.

18:15.770 --> 18:17.137
(groans) Dad, I'm sorry.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.539
I was trying
to change things too fast.

18:19.541 --> 18:22.542
No, I was holding on too tightly
to hear any of your ideas.

18:22.544 --> 18:23.943
That stops today.

18:23.945 --> 18:25.778
Because this is still
a dream come true for me.

18:25.780 --> 18:26.813
For me, too.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.314
Ever since I was a kid,

18:28.316 --> 18:30.149
I wanted to work
at Fuller Dermatology.

18:30.151 --> 18:31.817
You know what,
since we're a partnership,

18:31.819 --> 18:34.086
I think we should have
a name that reflects that.

18:34.088 --> 18:37.490
What do you think
of Fuller & Fuller Dermatology?

18:37.492 --> 18:39.057
Oh, well, let me think
about that one.

18:39.059 --> 18:42.060
Okay, yes, I've thought
about it and I love it!

18:42.062 --> 18:43.662
- (laughs): Good!
- Thanks, Dad.

18:43.664 --> 18:45.230
I'll always be the first
Fuller on the sign, yeah?

18:45.232 --> 18:46.331
- Yeah, of course, Dad.
- Okay.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.932
Okay, well,

18:47.934 --> 18:50.268
I'm gonna go crack open
a bottle of anything

18:50.270 --> 18:53.070
but raspberry champagne
and watch the game.

18:53.072 --> 18:54.972
See you tomorrow, partner.

18:54.974 --> 18:56.441
(quiet laugh)

18:56.443 --> 18:57.908
Dr. Allison Fuller?

18:57.910 --> 18:59.777
- Yep, that's me.
- Sorry about the delay.

18:59.779 --> 19:02.335
Looks like the package
got held up in New Orleans.

19:02.401 --> 19:04.248
Thank you.

19:18.363 --> 19:19.795
Huh.

19:19.797 --> 19:21.464
Well, I'm all packed up.

19:21.466 --> 19:24.267
System's fixed and
I'm officially retired.

19:24.269 --> 19:26.636
Oh, I see you got my gift.

19:26.638 --> 19:28.804
How do you like that logo?

19:28.806 --> 19:30.173
Yeah, you ordered this
a couple of days ago.

19:30.175 --> 19:31.274
How did you...?

19:31.276 --> 19:33.676
I have no logical explanation.

19:33.678 --> 19:36.121
Other than... (whooshing)

19:37.097 --> 19:39.013
(chuckles)
No.

19:39.015 --> 19:42.598
No, you've been getting our
practice name wrong for days.

19:42.651 --> 19:44.553
I'm sure you just gave them
the wrong name and got lucky.

19:44.555 --> 19:47.689
Look at you... your heart
wants so much to believe,

19:47.691 --> 19:50.329
but your limited medical mind

19:50.421 --> 19:52.327
just won't let it.

19:52.329 --> 19:54.328
How do you not believe?

19:54.330 --> 19:57.464
Especially after that miracle
I pulled off today.

19:57.466 --> 19:59.800
Your angeling seems
to follow a pattern

19:59.802 --> 20:01.835
of you massively screwing up

20:01.837 --> 20:03.970
and then saying it's celestial.

20:03.972 --> 20:06.973
Well, I work in
all sorts of ways.

20:10.817 --> 20:12.043
Seriously?

20:12.254 --> 20:13.479
A prescription pad?

20:13.481 --> 20:15.348
We never talked
severance package.
