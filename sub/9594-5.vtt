WEBVTT

00:30.264 --> 00:32.300
Titans, crime is afoot!

00:32.400 --> 00:35.503
I always thought
crime was a leg, bro. What!

00:35.603 --> 00:39.373
No, man.
If crime was anything
it would be a hand.

00:39.473 --> 00:41.375
-Oh!

00:44.178 --> 00:46.547
Not another word from you two.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.816
Crime is a leg.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.451
-Good one.
-Pay attention!

00:50.551 --> 00:53.654
There has been a rash
of crimes in and around
Jump City.

00:53.754 --> 00:57.458
And the only possible way
to stop them is...

01:00.261 --> 01:01.262
A stakeout.

01:03.331 --> 01:05.799
Ooh, what is the stakeout?

01:05.899 --> 01:08.669
Only the best way
to fight crime, Star!

01:08.769 --> 01:10.771
* Stakeout!
* Hidin' out in cars

01:10.871 --> 01:13.341
* Stakeout!
* Pizza, chocolate bars

01:13.441 --> 01:15.476
* Stakeout!
* Stayin' up real late

01:15.576 --> 01:17.678
* Stakeout!
* Puke up what you ate

01:17.778 --> 01:19.813
* Stakeout!
* It's just what we do

01:19.913 --> 01:22.350
* Stakeout!
* Shaggy, Scooby doo

01:22.450 --> 01:24.518
* Stakeout!
* Spot a creepin' dude

01:24.618 --> 01:26.687
* Stakeout!
* Bust the creepin' dude

01:26.787 --> 01:29.089
Stop! It is none of
those things, Star.

01:29.190 --> 01:32.860
Criminals have secrets
and it's our job
to ferret them out,

01:32.960 --> 01:35.095
through surveillance.

01:35.196 --> 01:37.698
Secrets

01:37.798 --> 01:40.234
This is going to be
a two man operation.

01:40.334 --> 01:41.502
Minus one man, plus one woman.

01:41.602 --> 01:44.138
The man, handsome, strong,

01:44.238 --> 01:45.773
intense, great hair.

01:45.873 --> 01:48.242
The woman,
innocent, beautiful,

01:48.342 --> 01:50.110
and in need of guidance.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.245
BOTH: We're in!

01:52.513 --> 01:54.448
No, no, no! You are not in.

01:54.548 --> 01:56.517
You two are terrible
at stakeouts.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.621
I see you.

02:03.591 --> 02:06.260
I see you, too.

02:09.697 --> 02:12.666
BEAST BOY: I still see you.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.836
Also, there is no stakeout.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.172
What?

02:18.272 --> 02:21.775
The "stakeout" is just
a way for me to be
alone with Starfire.

02:21.875 --> 02:25.213
The only crime tonight
will be the theft of a kiss,

02:25.313 --> 02:26.314
stolen by me,

02:26.414 --> 02:28.349
from Starfire, on my face,

02:28.449 --> 02:29.550
right here.

02:30.418 --> 02:31.785
Okie dokie.

02:31.885 --> 02:33.821
Why don't you just
ask her out,

02:33.921 --> 02:34.522
on a date?

02:34.622 --> 02:37.425
I have explored that option.

02:37.525 --> 02:39.827
Hey, Starfire,
you want to go on a date?

02:39.927 --> 02:40.894
No, thank you.

02:42.296 --> 02:43.831
A stakeout will be perfect.

02:43.931 --> 02:47.635
By the end of the evening,
lips on lips
will be happening.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.438
Congratulations, Starfire.

02:50.538 --> 02:53.474
You have been
selected for your keen
observational skill

02:53.574 --> 02:54.842
and strawberry scent.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.744
-Let's go.
-Hurray!

02:59.447 --> 03:00.681
Dude, is it true?

03:00.781 --> 03:02.450
Are we bad at stakeouts?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.718
Yes and everything else.

03:04.818 --> 03:08.422
-None of your business.

03:08.522 --> 03:11.325
Man, girl has so many secrets.

03:17.431 --> 03:18.599
Stakeout!

03:20.468 --> 03:21.635
Okay, Star,

03:21.735 --> 03:24.605
there are three rules
to a classic stakeout.

03:24.705 --> 03:27.841
Rule one, locate a den
of criminal activity.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.979
What crimes would
occur here, Robin?

03:32.079 --> 03:34.315
Crimes of passion.

03:35.716 --> 03:38.218
Rule two,
indirect observation.

03:38.319 --> 03:41.622
Use a reflective surface
to observe your surroundings.

03:41.722 --> 03:43.391
A mirror, a car window,

03:43.491 --> 03:44.858
my eyes.

03:45.626 --> 03:47.361
Rule three, I love you.

03:47.461 --> 03:48.862
What was the rule three?

03:48.962 --> 03:49.763
Concealment.

03:50.498 --> 03:51.599
Observe without
being observed.

03:52.400 --> 03:54.735
Now, keep looking
into my eyes.

04:01.775 --> 04:04.545
I see something
in the eyes.

04:04.645 --> 04:06.514
ROBIN: Is it a house,
picket fence,

04:06.614 --> 04:09.249
two point five kids,
a yard, cocker spaniel,

04:09.350 --> 04:10.651
dinner parties on the weekend
with friends?

04:10.751 --> 04:13.721
STARFIRE: No! It's shiny!

04:16.056 --> 04:19.427
Could this be the clue?

04:19.527 --> 04:22.262
-Mmm, not likely,
back to rule two.

04:22.363 --> 04:23.531
The eyes.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.878
No, it's happening again.

04:37.978 --> 04:39.713
If the others
knew my secret...

04:48.689 --> 04:50.324
Ooh, did you hear that?

04:50.424 --> 04:52.893
Her secret must be
so embarrassing.

04:52.993 --> 04:55.563
Then it can only be
one thing, bro.

04:55.663 --> 04:57.030
A secret crush.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.299
And it's probably you.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.701
No doubt.

05:00.801 --> 05:02.703
That's what she was
writing in that diary.

05:06.874 --> 05:09.710
Dear diary,
Beast Boy is so handsome,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.679
I wanna kiss his pretty face.

05:13.914 --> 05:16.717
I can't wait to read
the juicy details.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.388
Hmm, the words are moving.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.755
Oh!

05:26.394 --> 05:28.061
You're holding it
upside down, dummy.

05:40.541 --> 05:44.011
I never knew the Steak House
was made for stakeouts.

05:44.111 --> 05:45.045
And for make outs.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.514
-Nothing.

05:46.614 --> 05:48.882
I am learning
so much from you, Robin.

05:48.982 --> 05:51.419
But are we not
breaking rule three?

05:51.519 --> 05:52.620
The concealment.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.488
It's called,
hiding in plain sight.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.891
But I get it,
you want to go somewhere
we can be alone.

05:57.991 --> 05:59.393
I do.

06:00.561 --> 06:02.763
But first, you must excuse me
while I put on my face.

06:03.464 --> 06:04.765
Oh, yes!

06:04.865 --> 06:07.501
Lips to lips
is finally happening!

06:07.601 --> 06:09.369
-STARFIRE: I am ready!
What?

06:09.470 --> 06:11.138
Why, hello.

06:11.238 --> 06:13.373
I am The Jeff.

06:13.941 --> 06:15.375
Ta-da!

06:15.476 --> 06:16.910
Nice to meet you.

06:19.112 --> 06:22.783
Rule three, the concealment.

06:24.585 --> 06:27.655
Look what The Jeff has found.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.389
Pom, pom, pom!

06:29.490 --> 06:30.558
Come, Robin.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.726
Crime is the foot.

06:34.928 --> 06:37.431
Man, we spend all that
time in her room

06:37.531 --> 06:39.900
and we didn't find out
if I was her secret crush.

06:40.000 --> 06:43.504
-It is because
we went in cold.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.038
Then let's warm it up, bro.

06:50.578 --> 06:52.012
Stakeout, uh!

06:54.181 --> 06:56.850
-Double stakeout, uh-uh!

06:58.552 --> 07:00.954
BOTH: Stakeout, stakeout,
uh-uh-uh!

07:01.054 --> 07:03.123
We're ready to go back in.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.197
Another one.

07:11.264 --> 07:13.867
It was buried under
the discarded corn chowder.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.940
What have I done?

07:20.040 --> 07:22.843
Your strawberry scent
is gone forever.

07:24.645 --> 07:29.617
The trail of these
unnatural crystals
is no coincidence.

07:29.717 --> 07:32.586
I have to come clean.

07:32.686 --> 07:34.522
-Starfire...
Robin.

07:34.622 --> 07:37.124
The concealment.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.926
I am The Jeff.

07:39.026 --> 07:42.696
Indirect observation.

07:45.198 --> 07:47.868
Jeff, you have corn
in your mustache.

07:49.970 --> 07:51.805
The crime's afoot-ing.

07:51.905 --> 07:53.240
Listen, Star.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.009
The only crime
is I haven't been honest...

07:57.578 --> 07:58.712
Dr. Light?

07:58.812 --> 08:01.615
Robin, welcome,
come in, come in.

08:01.715 --> 08:04.117
What evilness are you
up to this time, Dr. Light?

08:04.217 --> 08:05.919
Evilness, no!

08:06.019 --> 08:08.656
Crystal chandeliers.
It's a passion of mine.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.490
One can't be evil
all the time.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.693
Chandeliers of death.

08:12.793 --> 08:14.027
What? No, no, no.

08:14.127 --> 08:16.764
It's the art of light.
Come, let me show you.

08:16.864 --> 08:19.199
I call this one,
The Pain of Defeat.

08:19.299 --> 08:21.669
And here we have,
Foiled Again.

08:21.769 --> 08:25.172
And this is one
of my personal favorites,
I'll Get You Next Time.

08:25.272 --> 08:28.041
And this one,
I just call, Titans.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.112
You see the colors,
they match your outfits.

08:33.313 --> 08:35.048
Crystals of crime.

08:37.017 --> 08:39.587
Who's the new guy?
Seems a little unhinged.

08:39.687 --> 08:42.756
I am The Jeff.

08:42.856 --> 08:45.025
ROBIN: Chandelier death rays!

08:45.793 --> 08:46.927
Ha!

08:52.299 --> 08:55.669
Ooh, crushed by
The Pain of Defeat.

08:55.769 --> 08:57.805
You'll pay for this, Jeff.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.676
The world can never
see this part of me.

09:02.776 --> 09:06.246
Man, why doesn't she
want anyone to know
she likes me?

09:08.682 --> 09:12.219
Because it sounds
like she's got it bad
for you, bro.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.957
I must cleanse myself
of darkness.

09:19.927 --> 09:22.062
Azarath Metrion Zinthos.

09:24.865 --> 09:26.700
I can't see anything.

09:26.800 --> 09:30.838
And I can't hear anything
over the cries from these
lost souls.

09:37.845 --> 09:40.180
Bro, our stakeout's
on the line.

09:52.392 --> 09:53.794
Dude, we missed it?

09:53.894 --> 09:57.197
Na-uh, I snapped a photo.

09:57.297 --> 10:00.100
We'll know exactly
what her secret is.

10:02.402 --> 10:04.604
That's a picture of me, Cy.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.140
You know what that means.

10:07.240 --> 10:10.844
-Bro, she is crushing
so hard on you, bro!

10:10.944 --> 10:12.913
BOTH: We are stakeout kings!

10:17.017 --> 10:18.852
STARFIRE:
What a thrilling adventure.

10:18.952 --> 10:21.989
My first stakeout
was a great success.

10:22.089 --> 10:25.325
You know it's funny, I brought
you out here tonight
to trick you into kissing me.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.662
-But instead,
I learned a lesson.

10:28.762 --> 10:30.130
It took your Jeff disguise,

10:30.230 --> 10:32.866
and the smell of rancid
corn chowder for me
to realize it,

10:32.966 --> 10:34.902
but besides being kind,

10:35.002 --> 10:36.770
sweet and the love of my life,

10:36.870 --> 10:38.271
you are a great detective.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.173
You tracked Dr. Light
to his lair

10:40.273 --> 10:42.910
using all three rules
to a classic stakeout.

10:43.010 --> 10:44.344
I'm proud of you.

10:44.444 --> 10:47.681
I could not have
done it without
your guidance, partner.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.317
New rule!

10:50.417 --> 10:53.320
-You do not mess with
The Jeff!
