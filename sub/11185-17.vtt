WEBVTT

00:00.934 --> 00:04.143
You don't talk, you don't
move, you don't even twitch.

00:04.271 --> 00:06.342
Back up! Get back there!

00:09.910 --> 00:11.218
Caitlin is on this ship.

00:11.278 --> 00:12.450
We've just gotta wait it out.

00:12.513 --> 00:13.753
How long are you gonna wait, Michael?

00:13.814 --> 00:15.623
Until they start throwing
bodies off that bridge?

00:15.682 --> 00:18.128
If anybody gets killed on the
outside, it's because of you.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.186
Just take it easy.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.425
You take it easy!

00:20.487 --> 00:22.125
Oh, my God, we're all gonna be killed.

00:22.189 --> 00:23.668
Just be calm.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.099
- Hawke!
- They're coming in the door.

00:27.661 --> 00:28.867
Shut up!

00:30.000 --> 00:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:05.959 --> 02:07.199
That's her.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.639
Classy looking lady.

02:10.697 --> 02:12.404
Rich lady.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.877
Good, she's alone.

02:16.370 --> 02:19.579
Look, are you guys sure you
wanna go through with this?

02:20.974 --> 02:23.318
I'm just checking, all right?

02:24.144 --> 02:26.750
I'm ready. I'm ready.

02:33.020 --> 02:34.021
Okay.

03:21.835 --> 03:22.939
Surprise.

03:23.270 --> 03:24.271
Barbara!

03:25.405 --> 03:26.884
I didn't think you were gonna make it.

03:26.940 --> 03:28.078
Neither did I.

03:28.141 --> 03:29.279
When did you get into town?

03:29.342 --> 03:32.585
Last night. I hitched a ride on Daddy's jet.

03:32.646 --> 03:34.125
Must be nice.

03:36.817 --> 03:40.321
Ellie, oh my God, look at you.

03:41.655 --> 03:42.895
I missed you.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.330
I missed you, too.

03:46.626 --> 03:50.802
How am I… no, no, no, it's wrong.
It's "How am I doing?"

03:51.298 --> 03:53.835
Good. You should call me up sometime.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.573
You could use the practice.

03:56.369 --> 03:57.370
Okay.

03:59.406 --> 04:02.785
Barbara, I'm so glad you could
make it. You look fabulous.

04:02.843 --> 04:04.083
Thank you.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.282
Don't I…

04:05.345 --> 04:06.551
Always.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.918
Well, I'm glad to see that
you haven't changed, Alicia.

04:12.819 --> 04:15.823
Nothing's changed. We're still
the same old rowdy crew, huh?

04:15.889 --> 04:19.336
Well, I'll have you know
I am not just a secretary.

04:19.860 --> 04:22.534
Ta-da! You're now looking at a boss.

04:22.829 --> 04:25.070
That's great.

04:25.132 --> 04:28.204
It's nice to see that you've finally
gotten what you always wanted.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.111
Well, somebody had to take charge.

04:30.704 --> 04:32.547
That's what we had Cate for.

04:32.606 --> 04:34.085
We sure did.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.650
Ellie's gonna have a baby next month.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.485
Yes, I can see that.

04:39.179 --> 04:41.591
Well, we all know what she's
been up to, don't we, girls?

04:52.993 --> 04:55.303
So, Cate, tell us how things are with you.

04:55.829 --> 04:57.706
Oh, I don't know.

04:58.198 --> 05:00.769
I guess I'm a little baffled
at being so content.

05:00.834 --> 05:02.142
Does that make sense?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.674
How about you, Ellie?

05:08.341 --> 05:11.379
Well, I don't run a data processing unit,

05:11.444 --> 05:13.583
or fly helicopters around a movie set,

05:13.647 --> 05:17.561
or jet hop around Europe, hot-tubbing
it with Princes and playboys,

05:18.785 --> 05:20.628
but John and I are very happy.

05:20.687 --> 05:22.758
Good for you, Ellie.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.995
A toast.

05:27.360 --> 05:33.038
Here's to enough. May we all be successful
enough, rich enough, thin enough,

05:33.133 --> 05:36.706
and may we all be wise enough to know
that even when we've got all that,

05:36.770 --> 05:37.771
it's still not enough.

05:37.838 --> 05:41.513
Oh, hear, hear. I'll drink to that.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.604
Ever since Lorenzo was
killed in Monte Carlo,

06:04.664 --> 06:07.838
I mean, Daddy's been
obsessed with protecting me.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.045
He's has bodyguards on me 24 hours a day.

06:11.171 --> 06:12.172
Well,

06:13.006 --> 06:16.783
first your Mother to cancer, then
Lorenzo in the racing accident.

06:16.877 --> 06:20.825
Don't you think your Father has a right
to be concerned about losing you?

06:21.915 --> 06:25.761
Sure, sure. Not to the extent
that he ends up smothering me.

06:26.219 --> 06:30.224
I mean, you don't understand Cate,
it's like… sometimes I feel like…

06:35.495 --> 06:39.568
You never would fall for one of my poor
little rich girl stories, would you?

06:41.902 --> 06:44.849
Barbara, just try to think
about how your Father feels.

06:44.905 --> 06:46.043
Yeah.

06:47.741 --> 06:52.121
But sometimes I feel like these guys are
in the shower with me. It's impossible.

06:52.178 --> 06:56.149
Okay, if these guys follow you
everywhere, where are they now?

06:57.817 --> 06:59.353
I gave them the slip.

07:00.654 --> 07:03.635
It's okay. It's a little game
we play. They'll find me.

07:04.624 --> 07:06.126
They always do.

07:27.814 --> 07:32.126
Paging Miss Scarelli.
Flowers for Miss Scarelli.

07:34.054 --> 07:35.260
Right here.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.334
Miss Scarelli?

07:42.395 --> 07:43.430
Yes.

07:43.496 --> 07:45.305
Flowers ma'am, it's a big box.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.244
Why don't you place them over
there on the chair for me?

07:48.301 --> 07:50.281
Well, I can't leave them here with you.

07:50.337 --> 07:51.372
What?

07:51.438 --> 07:53.247
I mean, the man who sent
me down here to find you

07:53.306 --> 07:57.220
told me that you had to meet him
in the Oyster Bar on the 2nd level.

07:58.111 --> 07:59.146
It's Robert.

07:59.212 --> 08:01.385
Oh I see, a romantic, huh?

08:02.082 --> 08:04.756
Miss Scarelli, if you'd
just follow me, ma'am.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.962
- Come on, Cate.
- No, no.

08:09.089 --> 08:12.866
His orders were alone. I mean,
that's what he said. He said alone.

08:13.393 --> 08:17.136
Hey look, I don't know, lady, I mean,
it's worth an extra $10 to me, okay?

08:17.197 --> 08:18.574
It's okay.

08:19.566 --> 08:21.011
All right, I'll bring him right back.

08:21.067 --> 08:22.740
- Okay.
- Come on.

08:22.802 --> 08:23.906
I'll follow you.

08:44.457 --> 08:45.765
Ellie, what are you do’n?

08:45.825 --> 08:48.601
Oh, I have to take home a souvenir to John.

08:49.896 --> 08:51.102
Don't say noth’n. Just keep walk’n.

08:52.298 --> 08:53.538
Zach, I'm getting real bad vibes.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.079
Cate! Cate!

08:55.135 --> 08:57.137
- Ellie, get back.
- Cate!

08:57.203 --> 08:58.978
What's happening? Barbara?

09:04.577 --> 09:07.751
Idiot, what did you do that for?
Now look what you've done!

09:14.988 --> 09:16.433
He's dead!

09:16.489 --> 09:17.900
I told you!

09:20.060 --> 09:21.539
Robert?

09:21.594 --> 09:24.700
Get everyone down below. Let's go.
We gotta get back to the hall.

09:24.764 --> 09:27.142
J.J., move it. Come on, come on.

10:16.182 --> 10:17.559
Is that land-line set up yet?

10:17.617 --> 10:18.652
Couple of minutes, Sergeant.

10:18.718 --> 10:20.095
So what's it look like?

10:20.153 --> 10:24.033
3 suspects have 15, maybe 20
hostages aboard the Queen Mary.

10:25.158 --> 10:26.569
Barbara Scarelli?

10:26.626 --> 10:28.264
That's why you're here.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.707
As far as we know, she's okay.

10:30.763 --> 10:32.401
How did it go down?

10:32.465 --> 10:34.843
Well, 1 of the suspects
cut loose with an Uzi.

10:34.901 --> 10:38.314
He killed 1 of Scarelli's
bodyguards and wounded another one.

10:38.438 --> 10:39.644
But where are they now?

10:39.706 --> 10:43.779
Well, they took Scarelli and the rest
of the hostages back to the Main Salon.

10:44.010 --> 10:45.717
Now what about Scarelli?

10:46.179 --> 10:48.489
Well, Mr. Scarelli, her Father,

10:48.548 --> 10:51.324
is a very rich, very powerful
Italian industrialist.

10:51.384 --> 10:54.194
He's also a good friend
of the United States,

10:54.254 --> 10:56.757
and he's got a lot of influence
with the majority members

10:56.823 --> 10:59.030
of the new government
recently seated in Italy.

10:59.092 --> 11:00.503
Otherwise, you wouldn't be here.

11:00.560 --> 11:01.664
Precisely.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.572
So what do you think?
Terrorist, Red Brigade, what?

11:04.631 --> 11:07.339
We don't have any
intelligence to support that.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.571
I think this is a kidnap for ransom.

11:09.636 --> 11:13.914
Now, I'd go along with that. The thing is,
we don't want to be wrong here, Lenny.

11:14.974 --> 11:17.386
What if we have to take some people out?

11:19.479 --> 11:21.288
You do what you have to do.

11:24.450 --> 11:25.986
Zach, get the lights.

11:36.563 --> 11:40.511
Damn it J.J., quit jump’n around.
You're start’n to scare me.

11:50.910 --> 11:54.084
You said everything was gonna be okay,
everything was gonna be all right.

11:54.147 --> 11:58.289
We're just gonna walk in, take
the lady, and walk off the boat.

11:58.718 --> 12:00.459
- You said it was gonna be easy.
- Shut up, J.J.

12:00.520 --> 12:02.625
Easy, that's what you said.

12:03.890 --> 12:05.494
They're gonna kill us.

12:06.359 --> 12:08.134
I mean, the SWAT team is gonna walk in here,

12:08.194 --> 12:09.730
they're gonna blow our
brains all over the walls!

12:09.796 --> 12:11.400
Shut up, J.J.!

12:16.002 --> 12:18.414
Bobby, listen to me a minute.

12:19.872 --> 12:23.513
Why don't we just give it up
right now, okay? I mean,
while we're still ahead, okay?

12:23.576 --> 12:24.919
What do you think?

12:24.978 --> 12:26.355
Knock it off, kid.

12:26.913 --> 12:28.688
He's right, you know.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.887
You could just give it all up right now.

12:30.950 --> 12:33.226
Now, you see, now you've got them doing it.

12:34.420 --> 12:36.627
Why, Robert? Why?

12:38.157 --> 12:39.864
Right now, I don't know.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.734
You don't know.

12:42.328 --> 12:44.171
You just did this on a whim.

12:44.364 --> 12:46.344
You didn't think anything
would go wrong here.

12:46.399 --> 12:47.901
No, we had a plan.

12:49.969 --> 12:52.848
This started out to be
just a simple kidnapping.

12:53.339 --> 12:54.750
Now it's a comedy.

12:56.909 --> 12:58.445
Comedy. A guy's dead.

12:59.045 --> 13:01.150
This isn't the Robert
you were telling me about.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.921
Yes, it is.

13:04.183 --> 13:07.096
But it isn't the same Robert
I was telling you about.

13:11.024 --> 13:12.435
Please.

13:13.860 --> 13:15.771
I thought we had something.

13:15.828 --> 13:16.966
We did.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.800
Your Father's money.

13:30.243 --> 13:31.950
Michael?

13:34.714 --> 13:35.886
What are you doing here?

13:35.948 --> 13:37.985
Are you kidding? It's in all the news.

13:38.051 --> 13:40.088
Caitlin is on this ship.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.154
Cate?

13:41.220 --> 13:42.597
Yeah. Now what are we gonna do about it?

13:42.655 --> 13:46.262
Well, right now there are no moves we
can make. We've just gotta wait it out.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.499
How long are you gonna wait, Michael?

13:48.795 --> 13:51.674
Until they start throwing
bodies off that bridge?

13:51.731 --> 13:53.472
By God, I'm not gonna wait that long.

13:53.533 --> 13:55.638
Dominic, this is a tactical situation.

13:55.702 --> 13:59.013
You both know what that
means. So, stay in control.

13:59.272 --> 14:00.876
Come here, and I'll brief you.

14:14.787 --> 14:16.232
Man, they're gonna blow our brains out!

14:16.289 --> 14:17.825
Will you shut up?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.631
Oh my God, we're all gonna be killed.

14:19.692 --> 14:21.399
No! No.

14:21.661 --> 14:23.834
Listen, we're their ticket
outta here. We'll be fine. Just…

14:23.896 --> 14:26.069
Everybody take it easy and just be calm.

14:26.132 --> 14:28.772
Now look, lady, let's get
someth’n straight right now.

14:28.835 --> 14:31.145
We don't need no leaders in this group!

14:31.871 --> 14:33.111
You got that?

14:46.753 --> 14:49.734
This is Sergeant Colvetti.
You're really stupid, you know?

14:49.789 --> 14:51.268
Where do you think you're gonna go?

14:51.324 --> 14:54.271
You think you're gonna pick up the
anchor and sail away on the Queen Mary?

14:59.265 --> 15:01.302
Is everybody all right up there?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.568
Yes.

15:03.369 --> 15:06.839
But they're not going to be unless
we get some cooperation in here

15:06.906 --> 15:08.180
and out there.

15:09.609 --> 15:12.089
I'm listening. Who's talking anyway?

15:13.946 --> 15:15.892
Bob. You call me Bob.

15:16.416 --> 15:19.158
Hey Bob, that's short for Robert, right?

15:19.652 --> 15:21.325
Look, just say what you're gonna say.

15:21.387 --> 15:22.661
Now we're on a roll, Robert.

15:22.722 --> 15:25.566
Now, why don't you let those nice
people go up there, huh, Bob?

15:26.025 --> 15:27.129
No way.

15:27.193 --> 15:28.501
No, they're keeping me alive.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.303
All right, listen, I'm just
trying to be reasonable.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.569
Tell me what you want.

15:35.134 --> 15:37.375
I want a helicopter to
take us out of this place.

15:37.437 --> 15:39.815
I want a jet fueled and ready at LAX.

15:41.174 --> 15:43.586
You might as well ask for the money.

15:47.613 --> 15:54.087
And I want Mr. Scarelli to transfer
$10 million into a Swiss bank account,

15:55.588 --> 15:59.661
or you can tell him that his little
girl will be the next one to die.

16:02.128 --> 16:03.607
And one more thing.

16:03.696 --> 16:07.405
Next time you people call back up here,
I wanna talk to somebody with clout.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.208
Somebody from Washington.

16:09.402 --> 16:11.177
You get me anybody with more authority

16:11.237 --> 16:14.548
than some slick-talking street
cop who's trained to talk,

16:15.107 --> 16:17.018
or I promise you there'll be
more people dying in here.

16:17.076 --> 16:18.350
All right, now take it easy.

16:18.411 --> 16:21.654
Just calm down. Nobody
wants anybody killed here.

16:22.248 --> 16:25.695
Then by God, you better get me
somebody with more authority

16:25.751 --> 16:28.527
than some flunky Police Sergeant!

16:35.127 --> 16:37.073
Looks like you got the ball.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.806
All right.

16:40.967 --> 16:42.640
The first thing we need
is a good scouting report.

16:42.702 --> 16:46.149
I want you to get me a layout. We need
to know exactly what we're up against.

16:46.205 --> 16:47.206
You got it.

16:47.440 --> 16:49.920
Listen, everything is gonna be all right.

16:51.844 --> 16:54.051
Look, if you just cooperate,

16:54.180 --> 16:55.352
do as I say,

16:56.048 --> 16:57.459
you'll be all right.

17:03.689 --> 17:06.897
What I'm saying is, I don't
want to have to hurt anybody.

17:08.294 --> 17:09.397
Let us go.

17:13.065 --> 17:14.601
This one's gonna give us trouble.

17:14.666 --> 17:15.667
Now…

17:21.874 --> 17:24.252
I'm not gonna have any trouble with you.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.378
Am I?

17:28.414 --> 17:29.916
Please let Ellie go.

17:30.917 --> 17:34.330
Robert, she is going to have a baby.

17:34.387 --> 17:35.525
I can see that.

17:35.588 --> 17:36.828
No, she stays.

17:38.524 --> 17:40.731
Cops don't like Mothers getting dead.

17:41.894 --> 17:42.929
You understand?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.895
Why haven't they called?

18:13.960 --> 18:15.030
They'll call.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.539
Relax, J.J.

18:16.929 --> 18:18.465
It's been at least a half an hour already.

18:18.531 --> 18:19.669
What do you think they're do’n out there?

18:19.732 --> 18:22.110
Takes time to organize all these things.

18:25.104 --> 18:28.381
They want to get everybody out of
here safely, including you, J.J.

18:28.541 --> 18:30.680
Right, I killed a man.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.748
And those cops out there,
they all wanna bury me.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.350
Not if you cooperate.

18:39.318 --> 18:40.490
Please! No!

18:40.553 --> 18:41.827
Robert!

18:44.657 --> 18:46.068
Now sit!

18:47.660 --> 18:51.005
You don't talk, you don't
move, you don't even twitch.

18:51.731 --> 18:54.075
If you're lucky, when they come
blowing through this door,

18:54.133 --> 18:56.079
they'll kill you before I will.

19:25.765 --> 19:26.800
Code?

19:30.970 --> 19:31.971
Cate?

19:33.372 --> 19:34.510
Be careful.

20:00.733 --> 20:02.906
Bobby, Bobby, they're coming in the door.

20:02.968 --> 20:04.106
Finally they're coming in.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.878
Back, back up! Get back there! Get go’n!

20:16.415 --> 20:18.019
Hawke.

20:23.823 --> 20:25.734
- Come on, hurry up!
- All right, all right.

20:25.791 --> 20:27.771
Get out of here!

20:27.827 --> 20:29.602
- Get moving!
- We are!

20:29.662 --> 20:31.369
Hawke, come in.

20:32.865 --> 20:33.900
Hawke!

20:35.434 --> 20:36.504
Hawke?

20:36.569 --> 20:38.242
Yeah Michael, Hawke here.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.317
We're okay, Michael.

20:41.040 --> 20:42.576
I don't know about inside, though.

20:44.143 --> 20:46.885
Come on! Come on!

20:50.583 --> 20:52.460
You stay there. Come on.

20:53.285 --> 20:55.788
You… you heard me, come on.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.235
The suspect's on the horn.
He's on a different extension.

21:06.298 --> 21:09.438
All right, clear that line. I don't want
anybody from the outside tap’n in.

21:09.502 --> 21:11.311
And find out where
that extension is located.

21:11.370 --> 21:12.747
What part of the ship.

21:19.879 --> 21:21.324
What's going on out there?

21:21.380 --> 21:23.519
What do you mean out here?
What about in there?

21:23.582 --> 21:24.720
You started that.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.230
Now look friend, I had
nothing to do with that.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.324
If anybody gets killed on the
outside, it's because of you, not me.

21:30.389 --> 21:32.665
Now look, friend, you just
take it easy. There's a way…

21:32.725 --> 21:34.329
You take it easy!

21:34.960 --> 21:36.906
You wanna kill us? You wanna kill them?

21:36.962 --> 21:38.236
No, I certainly don't.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.039
Because we'll do it if we
have to. We'll kill them.

21:41.100 --> 21:42.443
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.640
You wanted to talk to
someone from Washington.

21:44.703 --> 21:45.943
That's right. Who are you?

21:46.005 --> 21:49.782
I'm the man who can make it all happen
for you. You call me Archangel.

21:51.143 --> 21:52.747
I like it. Talk to me.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.990
Okay. Okay.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.524
Now, first of all, all those
things you asked for,

22:00.586 --> 22:01.997
that's gonna take some time.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.261
No, now you're starting
to sound like that cop.

22:04.824 --> 22:06.167
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

22:06.458 --> 22:09.337
You call me back when you
have something to tell me.

22:16.302 --> 22:18.782
I think we're gonna need all our resources.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.215
Get the Lady, Hawke.

22:20.272 --> 22:21.808
Now you're talk’n.

22:53.072 --> 22:56.315
Afternoon, sir. Looks like we really
have ourselves one this time.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.820
I'll fill you in as I can. Right now,

22:57.877 --> 23:01.586
I want you to set up shop and get me
an evaluation as soon as possible.

23:01.647 --> 23:04.184
What it would cost to go in
and get the hostages out.

23:04.783 --> 23:06.694
I'll get started on it right away, sir.

23:31.343 --> 23:32.947
How are you hold’n up?

23:35.481 --> 23:38.462
I want you to know how sorry
I am about all of this.

23:39.285 --> 23:40.992
You're blaming yourself?

23:41.520 --> 23:45.764
Now you know if it was not for me, you and
the others would not be in this mess.

23:46.358 --> 23:48.668
And those are the guys to lay this on.

23:51.130 --> 23:52.734
I'm scared, Cate.

23:54.934 --> 23:55.935
I know.

23:59.805 --> 24:01.250
I am, too.

24:04.944 --> 24:07.584
Do you remember when
we were in school together?

24:10.182 --> 24:12.628
I always wanted so much to be like you.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.153
What?

24:15.421 --> 24:18.868
I wanted to be like you because
you were the one who cared.

24:18.924 --> 24:21.564
You were the one who honestly,
really cared about people,

24:21.627 --> 24:23.732
- about things, about life…
- Barbara,

24:24.063 --> 24:25.633
you cared.

24:26.031 --> 24:29.638
You wanted to do something with
your life. You wanted to help people.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.079
I know you cared.

24:31.136 --> 24:32.638
Well, if I did,

24:32.705 --> 24:36.016
then why is it now, the only
person I can think of is myself,

24:36.508 --> 24:39.887
how I can get out of here,
how I can escape, run away?

24:41.146 --> 24:43.717
Because you've been running
all your life, Barbara.

24:46.752 --> 24:48.493
It's not easy growing up.

24:51.256 --> 24:52.826
Who's afraid of growing up?

24:52.891 --> 24:54.234
Who isn't?

24:54.927 --> 24:57.203
See, the thing about growing up

24:57.262 --> 25:01.472
is that you have to face something you
really don't want to and that is,

25:02.101 --> 25:04.547
a lot of the time, we have to go it alone.

25:06.338 --> 25:07.908
When I was a kid,

25:08.374 --> 25:12.447
I used to dream that there were wild
animals running around underneath my bed.

25:12.511 --> 25:15.458
So I went to my Dad and I
told him I was so scared.

25:16.081 --> 25:19.528
And he did probably the best
thing he's ever done for me.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.960
What was that?

25:22.187 --> 25:24.758
He told me I had to
solve the problem myself.

25:25.090 --> 25:26.467
What did you do?

25:28.227 --> 25:30.764
Got a saw and cut the legs off my bed.

25:31.530 --> 25:32.770
You…

25:59.391 --> 26:01.735
You, take the forward. You 2, cover.

26:21.513 --> 26:24.084
Coming up behind you, buddy.

26:27.786 --> 26:29.925
I'm not so sure about this, String.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.968
This is not altogether our decision.

26:37.996 --> 26:39.737
Let's just hope that Archangel's team

26:39.798 --> 26:41.368
takes care of those people at the airport.

26:41.433 --> 26:42.969
If they can't?

26:43.035 --> 26:44.776
Then I guess it'll be up to us.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.316
Watch yourself, kid.

26:47.873 --> 26:50.410
If you get a chance,
tell Cate I'm out here, huh?

26:50.476 --> 26:52.683
She knows that, partner.

27:10.562 --> 27:12.166
You've made a mistake.

27:14.299 --> 27:16.506
Don't you think I realize that?

27:25.043 --> 27:27.489
Then why don't you just give this up?

27:28.080 --> 27:31.061
At least let the others go.
You still have me.

27:31.116 --> 27:32.754
I can't do that.

27:33.886 --> 27:35.126
Not yet, anyway.

27:35.187 --> 27:38.225
I can't help wondering
what brought you to this.

27:40.859 --> 27:43.465
A few years ago, Zach and I hooked up

27:44.062 --> 27:46.565
flying a load of dope out of Colombia.

27:49.168 --> 27:51.614
We were overloaded taking off and crashed,

27:52.671 --> 27:55.845
and were caught, sent to a Bogota prison.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.057
That was a real hellhole.

28:03.815 --> 28:06.386
But I promised myself a lot of things there.

28:07.886 --> 28:10.423
And we were lucky. We managed to escape.

28:12.157 --> 28:15.297
Barbara, sometimes people
start off playing roles,

28:15.360 --> 28:17.897
and in the end, they've got to play them out.

28:25.404 --> 28:26.747
Scarelli.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.224
You okay?

28:41.386 --> 28:42.956
It's like a dream.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.698
It's like a bad dream.

28:46.892 --> 28:49.099
I think maybe if I close my eyes,

28:51.363 --> 28:53.400
this whole mess will go away.

28:54.466 --> 28:56.241
One way or the other.

28:57.269 --> 28:58.509
You can't give up hope, Alicia.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.174
Is she all right?

29:02.307 --> 29:04.378
Yeah, she's gonna be fine.

29:06.078 --> 29:07.785
Sure we will. We all will, Alicia.

29:11.016 --> 29:13.053
I am not all right.

29:14.386 --> 29:15.694
And it is because of you.

29:15.754 --> 29:16.994
Alicia.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.732
I am dying here!

29:21.493 --> 29:22.904
I am dying!

29:22.961 --> 29:26.204
Do you understand that? Does
that mean anything to you?

29:26.632 --> 29:28.305
Of course it does.
We've always been friends.

29:28.367 --> 29:29.539
No.

29:30.435 --> 29:33.973
You are nothing but a spoiled rich kid

29:34.039 --> 29:37.248
who never had to pay
for anything in her life

29:37.342 --> 29:38.685
until now.

29:39.478 --> 29:41.890
And now, we have to pay with you.

29:42.848 --> 29:44.418
It's not fair.

29:44.950 --> 29:48.397
You had it all. It's just not fair.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.128
I wish…

29:51.890 --> 29:53.665
I wish to God

29:55.093 --> 29:56.766
I'd never known you.

29:57.963 --> 30:00.341
Just go away. Just leave me alone.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.940
Just leave me alone.

30:08.907 --> 30:10.352
It's okay.

30:11.777 --> 30:13.552
It's all right.

30:23.422 --> 30:24.594
You okay?

30:24.656 --> 30:25.930
Yeah.

30:26.825 --> 30:28.805
Are you still mad at me?

30:30.462 --> 30:31.964
We're past that.

30:32.631 --> 30:35.237
Look, I'm really sorry… you know, I'm…

30:35.567 --> 30:37.103
I'm real sorry.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.849
I'm sorry I got you involved in this thing.

30:45.644 --> 30:47.851
You got noth’n to be sorry for.

30:56.154 --> 30:57.861
You gotta do me a favor.

31:00.192 --> 31:03.230
You remember that pact we
made in the bar, you and me?

31:07.499 --> 31:08.773
I can't do it.

31:09.234 --> 31:10.474
J.J., you promised.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.843
I know I promised.

31:11.903 --> 31:15.646
Look, I've been think’n about
it, you know, and I can't do it.

31:15.874 --> 31:17.512
You gotta do it for me, Bobby.

31:17.576 --> 31:18.748
I can't do that.

31:18.810 --> 31:20.551
Look, Bobby. Bobby!

31:22.080 --> 31:23.855
I can't go to prison.

31:24.082 --> 31:25.584
I'd never make it on the
inside and you know it.

31:25.650 --> 31:26.788
I made it.

31:26.852 --> 31:28.456
No, but I'm not as tough as you are.

31:29.454 --> 31:30.797
I never was.

31:31.323 --> 31:33.030
You gotta promise me, right now,

31:33.091 --> 31:34.798
if it looks like we're gonna get caught,

31:34.860 --> 31:37.670
if we're not gonna get out of this thing,

31:39.431 --> 31:41.172
Bobby, you gotta kill me.

31:47.439 --> 31:49.350
What are brothers for?

31:52.811 --> 31:53.949
Thanks.

32:39.424 --> 32:41.233
Okay, Robert?

32:41.293 --> 32:43.136
The money transfer has been arranged.

32:43.195 --> 32:46.142
The plane is fueled and waiting at the
airport, and I have a helicopter here

32:46.198 --> 32:49.611
standing by to transport you.
I want the hostages.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.012
Whoa, whoa. You're moving too fast.

32:53.238 --> 32:54.945
I'm trying to work this out.

32:55.006 --> 32:56.417
And I'm trying to stay alive.

32:56.475 --> 32:59.479
Then don't fight me, Robert.
When do I get them?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.652
After I check out that chopper.

33:04.416 --> 33:05.793
You get all but 4.

33:05.851 --> 33:07.228
I want them all.

33:07.285 --> 33:08.457
We get to the airport,

33:08.520 --> 33:12.058
get on the plane, everything checks
out okay, you get the others.

33:14.226 --> 33:15.728
Except for 1.

33:16.728 --> 33:17.866
Scarelli.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.272
That's right.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.402
You get her when we're safe.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.349
All right.

33:29.908 --> 33:32.650
I'll need 5 minutes to
get everything set up.

33:33.111 --> 33:34.488
You got it.

35:00.599 --> 35:02.010
Are you the pilot?

35:15.580 --> 35:16.854
You're a cop.

35:17.549 --> 35:18.721
I'm a pilot.

35:20.585 --> 35:22.121
So why you flying this one?

35:22.187 --> 35:23.825
I'm get’n paid for it.

35:25.357 --> 35:26.734
It's not enough.

35:29.394 --> 35:30.896
I figured you're make’n so much money,

35:30.962 --> 35:33.272
I might get a nice, large tip.

35:44.809 --> 35:46.413
You must be Archangel.

35:50.215 --> 35:51.523
All right, this will work for me.

35:51.583 --> 35:53.085
Fine.

35:53.952 --> 35:57.195
We'll get everybody out here
now and we'll be on our way.

35:58.490 --> 35:59.628
You carrying a weapon?

35:59.691 --> 36:01.637
We're playing by your rules.

36:02.227 --> 36:05.470
You play it smart and you'll
keep some people alive.

36:33.491 --> 36:34.834
Get ready.

36:38.496 --> 36:40.498
We're getting outta here.

37:08.793 --> 37:09.863
Move it!

37:09.928 --> 37:11.930
Come on! Come on!

37:11.996 --> 37:14.636
Hold your fire. We don't want anybody hurt.

37:14.699 --> 37:16.838
Stay away. Get down.

37:16.901 --> 37:19.541
Put your gun down! Get it down.

37:20.038 --> 37:21.073
Get in the chopper!

37:21.139 --> 37:23.050
- No, I can't, I can't.
- What?

37:23.108 --> 37:24.815
I'm afraid to fly!

37:48.199 --> 37:49.405
You got ‘em, Dom?

37:49.467 --> 37:51.174
I got ‘em, Michael.

37:51.236 --> 37:53.307
All right, just tail ‘em to the airport.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.215
If the snipers can't do the
job, then it's up to you.

38:17.695 --> 38:18.867
All right.

38:18.930 --> 38:21.809
Turn off your transponder
and hang a right turn.

38:24.369 --> 38:26.781
Our orders are to take you to LAX.

38:27.105 --> 38:29.142
So you do it now, friend.

38:29.707 --> 38:31.653
I'm not a chopper pilot,
but I'm good enough

38:31.709 --> 38:34.656
to get this thing down on the
ground in a controlled crash,

38:34.712 --> 38:37.659
and I guarantee you, you
won't walk away from it.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.080
Hey, airport's coming up, guys.

39:07.178 --> 39:10.182
You don't think Mr. Scarelli will mind
that we borrowed his personal jet

39:10.248 --> 39:12.057
to get outta the country, do you?

39:16.120 --> 39:17.656
Oh God, no, no. I told you…

39:17.722 --> 39:18.996
Alicia, no.

39:19.057 --> 39:23.028
No, I told you I can't fly.
I told you. Oh, God, no.

39:25.530 --> 39:27.271
Hawke!

39:28.399 --> 39:30.743
Mayday! Mayday!

39:30.802 --> 39:32.748
Dom, we're going down. Dom?

39:33.271 --> 39:34.944
Mayday! Mayday!

40:08.640 --> 40:11.052
Come on. Come on, run! Run!

40:17.282 --> 40:18.283
Come on!

40:23.221 --> 40:24.222
Now, J.J., you check the back.

40:24.289 --> 40:26.394
See if there's a way outta here. Careful!

40:31.696 --> 40:32.834
J.J.!

40:32.897 --> 40:33.967
Nothing!

40:39.470 --> 40:41.177
Stay here. You'll be okay.

40:54.252 --> 40:57.028
Dom, stop that plane.

40:57.388 --> 40:59.163
Don't let it get off the ground.

41:07.298 --> 41:08.709
Move! Move!

41:15.073 --> 41:16.245
Bobby!

42:54.739 --> 42:56.309
You hear that?

42:58.142 --> 42:59.883
Give it up, it's over.

43:31.542 --> 43:33.112
He's my brother.

43:40.051 --> 43:41.655
He's my brother.

43:49.293 --> 43:51.705
You'd never make it in prison. Would you?

44:01.772 --> 44:03.274
You understand?

44:04.675 --> 44:06.018
I understand.

44:10.548 --> 44:12.186
He's your brother.
