Well, it was written
by William Shakespeare.

40:43.542 --> 40:46.333
So? We're here.
We're listenin'.

40:48.500 --> 40:50.166
(CLEARS THROAT)

40:54.417 --> 40:56.041
Sit down.

41:00.500 --> 41:02.208
Okay, okay.

41:02.917 --> 41:05.375
All right,
here's the deal. Um...

41:08.542 --> 41:10.208
Hamlet is, uh...

41:13.250 --> 41:15.041
Uh, he's a prince.

41:15.375 --> 41:17.750
All right? And, uh...

41:17.750 --> 41:20.875
And he's away at college.
MONTGOMERY: Ah, rich kid.

41:20.875 --> 41:23.917
Right? And he...
He gets word that
his father died.

41:23.917 --> 41:26.875
Oh, no, Davis, please,
don't start cryin',
please.

41:26.875 --> 41:29.250
Leave me alone, Benitez!
(CHUCKLING)

41:29.250 --> 41:30.000
Forget about it.

41:30.000 --> 41:32.250
Benitez, shut up, all right?

41:33.208 --> 41:34.208
Chill.

41:34.417 --> 41:36.083
Go ahead.

41:37.041 --> 41:41.708
All right, so he comes home
from college for the funeral.

41:41.708 --> 41:45.750
And when he gets back,
everything's fishy.
All right?

41:45.750 --> 41:47.750
I mean, you ever hear
of the term,

41:47.750 --> 41:50.875
"Something is rotten
in the state of Denmark?"

41:50.875 --> 41:54.250
No, but in Apartment 3C,
my building, Ms. Leary,

41:54.250 --> 41:57.583
every Thursday,
she always cooks the
corned beef and cabbage.

41:57.583 --> 41:58.917
Mmm-hmm.
I tell you,

41:58.917 --> 42:02.750
something sure
does smell rotten
in the state of New York.

42:02.750 --> 42:04.750
All right.
It's the same kind of thing.
Oh, man.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.625
That was dumb.
That was real dumb.

42:06.625 --> 42:07.959
Leave him alone, man.

42:07.959 --> 42:11.625
All right. So, anyway,
he gets back
and he's in mourning.

42:11.625 --> 42:14.625
And less than a month
goes by,

42:14.625 --> 42:17.375
and his mother
gets remarried.

42:17.583 --> 42:19.333
Damn.

42:19.333 --> 42:20.458
To his uncle.

42:20.458 --> 42:21.667
What?
Uncle?

42:21.667 --> 42:24.083
That's the incest part, okay?

42:24.083 --> 42:26.959
So now, Hamlet spends
the rest of the play
trying to decide

42:26.959 --> 42:31.625
whether he's got
the guts to go after
his uncle, the king,

42:31.625 --> 42:32.959
and avenge
his father's death,

42:32.959 --> 42:36.667
or if he wants to just
go with the flow

42:36.667 --> 42:38.291
and do what his mother
is tellin' him to do.

42:38.291 --> 42:41.000
Oh, no.
Don't go out like
that, Hamlet. Uh-uh.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.333
So, well,
where I am in the play...
(CLEARS THROAT)

42:45.959 --> 42:47.834
He's with his mother
and the king,

42:47.834 --> 42:50.417
and she's trying
to cheer him up.

42:50.417 --> 42:52.250
And she says,

42:52.750 --> 42:55.792
"Good Hamlet,
cast thy nighted color off,

42:55.792 --> 42:58.708
"And let thine eye
look like a friend on Denmark.

42:58.708 --> 43:00.917
"Do not forever
with thy vailed lids

43:00.917 --> 43:04.500
"Seek for thy noble father
in the dust."

43:04.500 --> 43:05.625
What? Huh?

43:05.625 --> 43:07.542
Hey, you want
to lay that down
one more time?

43:07.542 --> 43:08.750
Yeah, please.

43:08.750 --> 43:10.834
Well, it's...
It's really easy.

43:10.834 --> 43:14.333
You just gotta listen to it,
all right?

43:14.333 --> 43:19.208
"Cast thy nighted color off."
Well, what color do we wear
at a funeral?

43:19.500 --> 43:20.458
Black.

43:20.708 --> 43:22.458
Black!

43:22.458 --> 43:23.750
A nighted color.

43:23.750 --> 43:26.000
She's tellin' him
not to wear black,
to stop mourning.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.667
HOBBS: Right. Right.
BILL: Right?

43:27.667 --> 43:28.917
Uh...

43:28.917 --> 43:32.333
It says,
"Let thine eye look like
a friend on Denmark."

43:32.333 --> 43:36.000
Which means she's sayin'
don't glare at me
as though you hate me.

43:36.000 --> 43:39.166
Why should he?
His father's body's
not even cold yet

43:39.166 --> 43:41.583
and she's given
the punani to Uncle Joe.

43:41.583 --> 43:43.000
MONTGOMERY: Right, right.

43:43.000 --> 43:46.208
Something like that.
Only it's Uncle Claudius.

43:46.625 --> 43:48.000
What the hell is a punani?

43:48.000 --> 43:50.208
MONTGOMERY: Cave boy
never heard of punani!
(ALL LAUGHING)

43:50.208 --> 43:53.208
Hey, Mr. Bill,
when my daddy
split on my mama,

43:53.208 --> 43:57.041
he moved in with, uh,
with her sister, who is,
of course, my auntie.

43:57.041 --> 44:00.208
And I got a baby cousin
who's also my baby sister.

44:00.208 --> 44:03.208
That's sort of the same
thing that we're talking
about, ain't it?

44:03.875 --> 44:05.875
Mel speaks. (CHUCKLES)

44:05.875 --> 44:07.750
(APPLAUSE)

44:07.750 --> 44:09.875
(WHISTLING)
Glad to have you, Mel.

44:09.875 --> 44:11.708
All right, all right.
I got a question.

44:11.708 --> 44:12.875
Yes?

44:12.875 --> 44:16.041
Now, if "look like a friend"
means "don't hate me,"

44:16.041 --> 44:18.542
why don't she just say,
"Don't hate me?"
Hoo-ah!

44:18.542 --> 44:19.917
Because it's poetry.

44:19.917 --> 44:22.667
Yeah, but it don't
even rhyme, yo.

44:22.667 --> 44:25.208
Yeah, but it's like,
you know, uh...

44:25.750 --> 44:26.917
It's language.

44:26.917 --> 44:31.250
It's trying to put things
together that evoke a...

44:31.583 --> 44:33.250
A certain...

44:33.792 --> 44:35.250
It sounds better.

44:35.250 --> 44:38.792
Uh, what do you mean?
I mean, it doesn't sound
like anything to me.

44:38.792 --> 44:39.917
I... I don't get it.

44:39.917 --> 44:42.792
Yeah. Come on, Teach.
Teach us.

44:42.792 --> 44:46.417
It's... All right.
It's a simile.

44:46.417 --> 44:47.750
A what?

44:47.750 --> 44:49.667
A simile. All right, here.

44:49.667 --> 44:51.166
BENITEZ: A simile.
BILL: Yeah.

44:51.166 --> 44:53.000
MONTGOMERY: That's easy.
That's the little yellow
face with a smile on it.

44:53.000 --> 44:54.417
I know that.
HOBBS: No, it's not.

44:56.917 --> 44:59.291
MONTGOMERY: "Simile."
"Simile."

45:00.625 --> 45:04.625
It's, uh,
when you take two things

45:04.625 --> 45:08.417
that, um, don't seem alike,

45:09.583 --> 45:11.583
but in a way, they are.

45:11.583 --> 45:12.583
Huh?
Hmm?

45:14.166 --> 45:17.458
All right.
All right, we're lookin'
for a simile. Haywood.

45:17.667 --> 45:19.291
Um...

45:19.625 --> 45:21.291
You're, uh...

45:21.708 --> 45:24.291
You're workin' in
the mill and, uh,

45:25.125 --> 45:27.125
you come home,
or you're on your way home.

45:27.125 --> 45:29.166
You go to a bar,
you stop for a brew.

45:29.166 --> 45:31.959
And in the bar,
down at the end of the bar
is a beautiful woman.

45:31.959 --> 45:34.375
And she winks at you.

45:34.375 --> 45:38.333
All right?
You go to her, like...
Fill in the blank.

You gotta love
those barnyard similes.

45:53.125 --> 45:55.000
All right, that was a simile.
Way to go.

45:55.000 --> 45:58.333
BILL: Now, here's somethin'
else, a metaphor.

45:58.583 --> 46:00.041
All men are...

46:00.041 --> 46:02.166
Dogs.
Dogs.

46:02.166 --> 46:04.041
Oh.
BILL: Okay, you got it?

46:04.041 --> 46:06.166
Simile, "Like dogs."

46:06.166 --> 46:11.500
Well, here's metaphor.
We just plain are dogs.

46:11.500 --> 46:16.333
Okay? All right.
Now, this is a good one here.
All right, let's see.

46:19.667 --> 46:21.000
"Oxymoron."

46:21.000 --> 46:22.875
Hey, hold up, hold up,
hold up, hold up.

46:22.875 --> 46:24.041
You can't do that.
That is a diss.

46:24.041 --> 46:26.333
I ain't no ox-moron.
All right?

46:26.333 --> 46:31.041
No, no, no, no.
Not ox-moron, schmuck.
Oxymoron.

46:31.041 --> 46:34.333
It's when you take two
words that are totally
the opposite,

46:34.333 --> 46:39.667
and you jam 'em together.
All right? Like, uh,
"Military intelligence."

46:40.750 --> 46:42.417
"Dark victory."

46:42.875 --> 46:44.667
"Thunderous silence."

46:47.750 --> 46:48.708
Hmm?

"Girly man."

about you, Benitez.

46:55.083 --> 46:57.417
All right. Okay, so...
BENITEZ: You're killin' me.

46:57.417 --> 47:02.041
Let's end the class
with, uh, an oxymoron
from Shakespeare himself.

47:02.041 --> 47:04.917
"Parting is such
sweet sorrow."

That was neat.

the same, Bill?

if you'd employ

a bit more discipline
in your classroom.

too much to ask?

You got a bug up
your ass or something?
You know what I think, Bill?

48:49.166 --> 48:51.166
I think your
whole class thing
is a bunch of bullshit.

wastin' my time.

in the class,

is my time, Bill.

they're gonna learn that

out here with me!

certain of that.

we have to do something,

we might as well
do something that I love...

01:01:06.834 --> 01:01:08.542
It's the food,
I'm tellin' you.

01:01:08.542 --> 01:01:09.500
Oh, Jesus!

01:01:10.708 --> 01:01:11.959
Junior, where you goin'?

01:01:11.959 --> 01:01:15.417
DAVIS: I gotta go back!
We're gonna be late! Junior!

01:01:18.792 --> 01:01:20.208
Oh, no! Oh, no! Oh, no!
No, no, no!

01:01:20.208 --> 01:01:22.750
Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop! Wait, wait, wait!
What?

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.083
MAN: Come on, guys.
Oh, Jesus.

01:01:24.083 --> 01:01:25.959
What's your freakin'
problem, Davis?

01:01:25.959 --> 01:01:28.458
My bag!
My daddy's bracelet!

01:01:28.458 --> 01:01:29.625
His what?

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:31.792
It's a Montagnard bracelet.
He got it in Vietnam.

01:01:31.792 --> 01:01:32.959
He wore a bracelet?

01:01:32.959 --> 01:01:34.917
Lots of soldiers
wore 'em over there.

01:01:34.917 --> 01:01:36.000
I left it in
my shirt pocket.

01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.083
So good.
Now it'll be clean.
Come on. Let's go.

01:01:38.083 --> 01:01:40.125
Come on, man!
What if it gets lost?

01:01:40.125 --> 01:01:43.417
Please, you gotta
help me, man.
It's all I got.

01:01:44.250 --> 01:01:47.083
We gotta get this
to the quartermaster's
laundry on time.

01:01:47.083 --> 01:01:48.792
(IMITATES AL PACINO)
I don't care what
you gotta do.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:50.875
Just look for
the bracelet, okay?

01:01:50.875 --> 01:01:51.917
All right.
What's his name?

01:01:51.917 --> 01:01:54.125
His name
is Brian Davis, Jr.

01:01:54.125 --> 01:01:55.708
Come on, man.
This is stupid.

01:01:55.708 --> 01:01:56.959
Shut up, you!

01:01:56.959 --> 01:01:59.792
I kill you, you cockroach!
Shut up!

01:01:59.792 --> 01:02:01.125
Now look.

01:02:01.125 --> 01:02:03.875
I gotta touch
the dirty clothes, man?
You kiddin' me.

01:02:03.875 --> 01:02:05.667
Oh, shit.
Please, please.

01:02:05.667 --> 01:02:07.792
Yes! Yes! Here it is.

01:02:07.792 --> 01:02:09.959
Oh, man, thank you.
Thank you!

01:02:09.959 --> 01:02:12.291
CASS: Prepare to uncover!

01:02:12.291 --> 01:02:17.792
ALL: Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six, five, four,
three, two, one!

01:02:17.792 --> 01:02:19.959
Freeze! I said freeze!

01:02:19.959 --> 01:02:22.291
What was that again?
What time is it?

01:02:22.291 --> 01:02:26.625
ALL: Drill Sergeant!
Breakfast is at 0600,
Drill Sergeant!

01:02:26.625 --> 01:02:28.291
0600. That's correct.

01:02:28.291 --> 01:02:32.125
Which, by my reckoning,
has come and gone,
has it not?

01:02:32.125 --> 01:02:34.166
RECRUITS: Drill Sergeant!
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

01:02:34.166 --> 01:02:37.000
Hi, Miranda.
CASS: I don't know.
Maybe it's me this morning.

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.333
I just can't seem to hear ya.
I don't hear that...

01:02:45.125 --> 01:02:48.625
Benitez! Davis!
Front and center!

01:02:56.333 --> 01:02:58.333
You wouldn't happen
to have the time,
would you, Private?

01:02:58.333 --> 01:03:00.333
Sorry, Drill Sergeant.
Slight problem with the
laundry, Drill Sergeant.

01:03:00.333 --> 01:03:03.667
So does this building look
like a Denny's to you,
New York?

01:03:03.667 --> 01:03:04.834
Mmm-mmm.
Huh?

01:03:04.834 --> 01:03:06.834
Show me where it says,
"Breakfast served anytime."

01:03:06.834 --> 01:03:08.041
Um...

01:03:08.041 --> 01:03:10.000
Get on down there
and push 10. Push 10!

01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:11.583
Drill Sergeant,
it was my fault,
Drill Sergeant!

01:03:11.583 --> 01:03:14.291
Now, who was I talkin' to?
Was I talkin' to you?
One, two, three, four...

01:03:14.291 --> 01:03:17.250
Drill Sergeant,
I asked him to help me
find my daddy's bracelet.

01:03:17.250 --> 01:03:19.041
"My daddy. My daddy."
My daddy sent it home
to me before...

01:03:19.041 --> 01:03:20.125
CASS: Your daddy
ain't here, son,

01:03:20.125 --> 01:03:22.375
and your daddy
can't help you!

01:03:22.375 --> 01:03:24.917
I don't know if anybody
can help you, high-speed.

01:03:24.917 --> 01:03:26.041
But I'm sure...
BILL: Lou!

01:03:26.041 --> 01:03:28.708
Lou, go easy on the kid.

01:03:28.708 --> 01:03:30.250
What?

01:03:30.250 --> 01:03:34.041
He's five minutes late.
I mean, talk about anal.

01:03:34.041 --> 01:03:36.041
You must've been
toilet-trained at gunpoint.

01:03:36.041 --> 01:03:37.542
(STIFLES CHUCKLE)

01:03:40.917 --> 01:03:43.583
Come over here.
Come over here.

01:03:43.583 --> 01:03:47.333
What? What, Lou?
Take it easy.
Come over here. Right here!

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:49.333
Don't you ever interrupt me
when I'm talkin'
to my soldiers.

01:03:49.333 --> 01:03:51.417
He was five minutes late.
You understand me? Man!

01:03:51.417 --> 01:03:54.208
You been on my bad side
ever since the day
I laid eyes on you.

01:03:54.208 --> 01:03:55.875
Oh, yeah?
Now, you better
comprehend this, Bill.

01:03:55.875 --> 01:03:57.208
You better get this down.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:04:00.417
'Cause I have had it
with your smug
college-boy attitude.

01:04:00.417 --> 01:04:03.250
Yeah?
Now you listen to me.
Stay away from me.

01:04:03.250 --> 01:04:06.959
And don't you ever,
ever impugn my authority
in front of my soldiers.

01:04:06.959 --> 01:04:08.917
Now, you got that, man?
Yeah, I got that.

01:04:08.917 --> 01:04:10.959
You got it?
Yeah, I got it.

01:04:10.959 --> 01:04:12.583
Now, that's point blank
and period.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.583
(MUTTERING)

01:04:15.625 --> 01:04:16.708
(CHUCKLES)

01:04:22.125 --> 01:04:23.125
For the rest
of the week, Private,

01:04:23.125 --> 01:04:25.083
you'll show up here
nine minutes early.

01:04:25.083 --> 01:04:27.417
You will report here...
BILL: Davis.

01:04:27.417 --> 01:04:31.792
Just show up to my class
nine minutes late is all,
you see? No problemo.

01:04:31.792 --> 01:04:33.750
Oh, that's it! That is it!
What?

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:35.083
Drill Sergeant!

01:04:35.083 --> 01:04:36.959
What? What? What?
Who do you think you are?

01:04:36.959 --> 01:04:38.291
You gonna tell me
what to do, huh?

01:04:38.291 --> 01:04:40.291
You're nothing!
You're nothing!
I'm nothing?

01:04:40.291 --> 01:04:42.500
Did you hear what he said?
I'm nothin'!

01:04:42.500 --> 01:04:45.625
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. I'm right here.
Just let me...

01:04:47.041 --> 01:04:48.667
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

01:04:48.667 --> 01:04:49.625
Sir?

01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:56.917
So they finally sent you
to the principal's
office, huh?

01:04:56.917 --> 01:04:59.000
Yeah.

01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.750
Man could've killed you,
Mr. Rago.

01:05:02.125 --> 01:05:04.834
He would've been
court-martialed,
but he could've killed you.

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:05.959
He started it.

01:05:05.959 --> 01:05:08.208
I don't know what happened,
and I don't care.

01:05:08.208 --> 01:05:09.875
All I care about
is this program.

01:05:09.875 --> 01:05:15.625
And I will not let you,
Sergeant Cass, or anybody
curtail its chances, okay?

01:05:17.834 --> 01:05:19.458
Okay.

01:05:20.542 --> 01:05:22.834
You never served
in the military,
did you, Mr. Rago?

01:05:24.083 --> 01:05:27.041
No. My military experience
is limited to the day

01:05:27.041 --> 01:05:29.125
that I walked for hours
in the rain

01:05:29.125 --> 01:05:31.834
from Arlington Cemetery
to the White House

01:05:31.834 --> 01:05:33.208
carrying the name
of a soldier

01:05:33.208 --> 01:05:35.667
who died needlessly
in Vietnam.

01:05:37.166 --> 01:05:38.792
Do you remember
the soldier's name?

01:05:43.000 --> 01:05:44.500
No.

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:47.834
Do me a favor, Bill.

01:05:49.041 --> 01:05:51.375
Whatever your
personal views are,
while you're here,

01:05:51.375 --> 01:05:55.708
remember you are a guest
of the United States Army,
okay?

01:05:58.708 --> 01:06:00.166
Okay.

01:06:00.166 --> 01:06:02.625
From now on,
by the book.

01:06:03.917 --> 01:06:04.875
Dismissed.

01:06:07.875 --> 01:06:09.208
"By the book."

01:06:09.208 --> 01:06:10.708
What am I doin' here?

01:06:13.375 --> 01:06:17.875
"Spud Duds, Spud Duds.
Potato topping
for the whole family."

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.542
Hmm.

01:06:32.041 --> 01:06:33.250
HOBBS: How late is he now?

01:06:33.250 --> 01:06:34.917
MYERS: He's very late.
What difference does it make?

01:06:34.917 --> 01:06:36.208
(EXHALES)
HOBBS: Damn.

01:06:36.208 --> 01:06:37.291
MYERS: Why would he do this?

01:06:37.291 --> 01:06:38.417
MONTGOMERY:
Hey, check it out.

01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:40.542
We got us
a substitute teacher.
(ALL LAUGHING)

01:06:40.542 --> 01:06:42.375
BENITEZ:
He looks just like Mel.
Bring it here, bring it here.

01:06:42.375 --> 01:06:44.375
MONTGOMERY: Which
one is the dummy?

01:06:44.375 --> 01:06:47.583
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Melvin. Wake up, Mel.

01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:49.750
Time for school, Mel.

01:06:56.417 --> 01:06:57.583
MONTGOMERY: So how long
are we supposed
to hang around?

01:06:57.583 --> 01:06:59.417
Your war stuff looks good.
LEROY: He's just late.

01:06:59.417 --> 01:07:01.125
BENITEZ: Maybe he got
sick or something.

01:07:01.125 --> 01:07:03.166
MONTGOMERY: Yeah, sick of us.

01:07:03.166 --> 01:07:05.250
Oh. Sorry I'm late.
HOBBS: Here comes the excuse.

01:07:05.250 --> 01:07:07.417
The traffic really stunk.

01:07:07.417 --> 01:07:09.417
MONTGOMERY:
Traffic? Whoo! See?

01:07:09.417 --> 01:07:11.542
(LAUGHS) You ever notice
when you're in a hurry,

01:07:11.542 --> 01:07:14.792
they radio-dispatch
all people to drive
in front of you?

01:07:15.959 --> 01:07:16.792
It's ridiculous.
What?

01:07:17.875 --> 01:07:18.875
Okay.

01:07:19.792 --> 01:07:21.583
So where were we?

01:07:22.083 --> 01:07:24.083
Where were we?
We were here.

01:07:24.083 --> 01:07:26.291
ALL: Hoo-ah.

01:07:26.291 --> 01:07:28.750
Give me a break, will ya?
I had something important.

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.333
That's all right, Bill.
We're used to it.

01:07:31.333 --> 01:07:32.375
BENITEZ: That's for sure.

01:07:32.375 --> 01:07:35.166
It was a job interview,
for cripes' sake.

01:07:35.166 --> 01:07:37.291
HOBBS: A what?
MYERS: Job interview?

01:07:37.291 --> 01:07:39.291
MYERS: I thought
this was your job.
Mmm-mmm.

01:07:39.291 --> 01:07:41.333
We're part-time,
like a paper route.

01:07:41.333 --> 01:07:44.667
Oh, come on.
Hey, what do you want
from me?

01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:46.792
Not much, I guess.

01:07:48.291 --> 01:07:50.667
Let's get out of here.
Who needs him?

01:07:50.959 --> 01:07:52.125
Huh?

01:07:52.125 --> 01:07:54.333
Yeah, look,
we got Victory Tower
at 1700, sir.

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:55.625
Yeah. Everybody,
fall in outside.

01:07:55.625 --> 01:07:57.458
BILL: I don't
believe you guys!
You stay and listen.

01:07:57.458 --> 01:07:59.500
Yeah. We ain't nothin'
but a hobby to you.

01:07:59.500 --> 01:08:01.792
BENITEZ: Hey, Davis,
we'd better go.

01:08:02.458 --> 01:08:05.166
We might get stuck
behind some old people.

01:08:05.166 --> 01:08:07.291
You guys are never late,
right, Benitez?

01:08:07.291 --> 01:08:09.166
HAYWOOD: Last time I come
to this damn class.

01:08:09.166 --> 01:08:11.000
I got 15 minutes left!

01:08:13.041 --> 01:08:15.041
I stood up for you, Davis.

01:08:15.041 --> 01:08:16.667
Oh, sure.

01:08:17.166 --> 01:08:18.834
Go ahead, go.

01:08:26.125 --> 01:08:27.834
Oh, to hell with 'em.

01:08:35.250 --> 01:08:38.667
If I lose 'em now,
I'll never get 'em back. Damn!

01:08:43.332 --> 01:08:47.500
Victory Tower, Victory Tower,
Victory Tower, Victory Tower.

01:08:47.500 --> 01:08:50.707
(ALL CHEERING)
CASS: Come on.
Let's go! Let's go!

01:08:53.291 --> 01:08:55.250
Come on!

01:08:55.250 --> 01:08:57.207
That's it, Leroy!
That's it!

01:08:57.207 --> 01:08:59.125
Hand over hand!
Hand over hand!

01:08:59.125 --> 01:09:00.707
CASS: That's good, Leroy!

01:09:01.041 --> 01:09:02.291
Yes!

01:09:02.291 --> 01:09:04.000
All right.
Outstanding!

01:09:12.041 --> 01:09:13.875
Hey, look! Billy boy!

01:09:17.457 --> 01:09:21.041
Oh, you are lookin'
at one puffin' and
reckless libertine!

01:09:22.041 --> 01:09:23.375
Check that. Whoop!

01:09:23.375 --> 01:09:25.041
Fish in the net!

01:09:26.707 --> 01:09:30.375
Montgomery, Leroy,
you hold it!
Don't go anywhere!

01:09:30.375 --> 01:09:32.959
I got 15 minutes
and I want 'em now!

01:09:33.625 --> 01:09:36.082
Shakespeare,
what are you doin' here?

01:09:36.082 --> 01:09:37.250
Hold on a second, Lou.

01:09:37.250 --> 01:09:39.291
All right, I was late.
Big deal.

01:09:39.291 --> 01:09:41.166
You guys gotta
give me a break.
Rago.

01:09:41.166 --> 01:09:42.500
This is important, Lou.

01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:45.582
No. No, Bill.
This is important. This.
This is why we're here.

01:09:45.582 --> 01:09:49.125
This is what
we're here to do. Go!
Hold on a second.

01:09:49.125 --> 01:09:51.041
Hobbs, hold on one second!

01:09:51.375 --> 01:09:52.959
Come down from there!

01:09:53.917 --> 01:09:55.333

01:09:55.333 --> 01:09:58.458
Hobbs, I got 15 minutes
left, and I want 'em!

01:09:58.458 --> 01:10:00.250
I don't think they want

01:10:00.250 --> 01:10:01.417
Montgomery!

01:10:01.417 --> 01:10:03.458
Montgomery, get down here!

01:10:03.458 --> 01:10:04.917
I don't even think
they can hear you.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:08.291
RECRUIT: Come on, Davis.
Do this one for Daddy!
Make him proud!

01:10:08.291 --> 01:10:10.750
You know, from down here.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:14.667
Hey, wait a minute!
Just hold up, Drill Sergeant.

01:10:14.667 --> 01:10:19.625
You can't just quit. Whoa!
That's what you been

Don't go nowhere.
Hold it. Whoa.

01:10:25.291 --> 01:10:27.834
Okay, you guys got problems.

Well, so do I, goddamn it!

01:10:30.291 --> 01:10:32.625
Move! Move, Davis!
Keep moving!

01:10:32.625 --> 01:10:34.333
Mr. Rago, you're gonna
make me fall!

01:10:34.333 --> 01:10:35.291
What the hell

01:10:35.291 --> 01:10:36.792
Ahhh!

CASS: Great, Oswald!
Whoa!

01:10:38.625 --> 01:10:39.583

01:10:39.583 --> 01:10:41.792
MONTGOMERY: Rago,

01:10:41.792 --> 01:10:44.458
CASS: Hey, Montgomery,

01:10:44.458 --> 01:10:46.834
Montgomery, where ya goin'?

01:10:46.834 --> 01:10:50.333
I can't talk to you
right now, Mr. Rago!
Can't talk to you now!

01:10:50.333 --> 01:10:51.792
CASS: That's it!

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:53.000
Hold it!
Get over there.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:55.000

Hold it. (GRUNTS)
CASS: Keep movin'!
Keep movin'!

01:10:59.708 --> 01:11:02.417
You've gone
far enough, Mr. Rago.
All right? Now go down.

01:11:02.417 --> 01:11:04.834
Do any of you have
the slightest idea

01:11:04.834 --> 01:11:07.834
what it's like
to have mortgages...

01:11:07.834 --> 01:11:12.000
RECRUIT: Get him. Get him.
...doctor bills,
alimony payments...

01:11:12.542 --> 01:11:14.375
Wait till you have
your kids.

01:11:14.375 --> 01:11:15.750
Then you talk to me
about priorities.

01:11:15.750 --> 01:11:18.417
Then you tell me
what it's like to have
a little cash flow.

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.500
Davis, what the hell
are you doing?

01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:22.834
You got up here.
Now you gotta get down.

01:11:25.417 --> 01:11:27.333
Get on your knees
for safety, sir.

01:11:27.333 --> 01:11:29.834
Huh? Jeez.

01:11:32.333 --> 01:11:33.875
Whoa!

01:11:37.208 --> 01:11:39.500
Oh, that's far.

01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.708
CASS: Baby Huey!
HUEY: Hoo-ah?

01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:44.375
Show Shakespeare

01:11:44.375 --> 01:11:46.041
Yes, Drill Sergeant!

01:11:48.542 --> 01:11:50.417
Lane one on rappel!

01:11:50.417 --> 01:11:52.041

Holy shit.

Too easy, huh?

01:12:15.375 --> 01:12:17.166
Too easy, Drill Sergeant.

01:12:18.417 --> 01:12:19.959
Your turn, Rago!

01:12:21.250 --> 01:12:22.500

CASS: To be or not to be,
Shakespeare! What'll it be?

01:12:26.250 --> 01:12:29.792
All right. Okay.
Come on.

01:12:29.792 --> 01:12:32.250
Let's go! Let's go!
Mr. Rago, you do
not want to do this.

01:12:32.250 --> 01:12:33.291
I'm doin' it. Let's go.

01:12:33.291 --> 01:12:34.792
No! You do not want
to do this, sir.

01:12:34.792 --> 01:12:36.625
What are you doin'?
You're clippin' him?

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.750
Watch the jewels. Ooh.
Clippin' him.
He wants to do it.

01:12:38.750 --> 01:12:40.625
All right. Okay.
All right.

01:12:40.625 --> 01:12:43.583
Put on the gloves,
Mr. Rago.

01:12:43.583 --> 01:12:45.792
All right. Get down.
Get down.

01:12:45.792 --> 01:12:48.625
You're gonna swing
your legs over the edge
of the platform here.

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:50.583
There's a ledge
right on the wood.

01:12:50.583 --> 01:12:52.333
You got to get your feet
on the ledge.

01:12:52.333 --> 01:12:53.750
(WHISPERING) Ledge, ledge.

01:12:53.750 --> 01:12:55.417
Put your foot down
and find that ledge.
What ledge?

01:12:55.417 --> 01:12:56.750
CASS: Come on, Rago!
The ledge.

01:12:56.750 --> 01:12:58.583
There's a ledge.
No ledge! No ledge!

01:12:58.583 --> 01:13:00.458
There's a ledge.
CASS: Let's go.

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:02.041
The ledge, right there.
Okay.

01:13:02.041 --> 01:13:05.583
Come on. Get your foot on it.
Get both those feet on there.
All right.

01:13:05.583 --> 01:13:08.083
All right,
now just lean back.

01:13:08.291 --> 01:13:09.750

01:13:09.750 --> 01:13:13.000
Okay, first thing,
don't look down.

CASS: What the hell
you doin'?

01:13:15.291 --> 01:13:17.458
Whoa! Ah!

01:13:17.458 --> 01:13:19.792
I told ya
not to look down!

01:13:19.792 --> 01:13:22.333
Everybody looks down
when you tell 'em not
to look down, you know that!

01:13:22.333 --> 01:13:23.625
All right.

01:13:23.625 --> 01:13:26.792
All right. Look, look.
Just lean back, relax.

01:13:26.792 --> 01:13:29.959
Okay? Everything's
gonna be all right.
I got the rope up here,

01:13:29.959 --> 01:13:33.458
and there's a guy down
there with the other end
of the rope.

01:13:33.458 --> 01:13:35.458
Come on. Relax.
Just lean back.

01:13:35.458 --> 01:13:36.959
Get the rope.
There you go.

01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.417
All right You all right
down there, man?

01:13:39.417 --> 01:13:40.834
Come on, Mr. Bill.
No sweat.

01:13:40.834 --> 01:13:44.166
Melvin? He'll be asleep
before I reach the ground!

01:13:44.166 --> 01:13:48.041
He's not gonna be asleep.
He's gonna be all right.
Just trust me, man.

01:13:49.708 --> 01:13:52.542
All right.
The Victory Tower is yours.

01:13:52.542 --> 01:13:54.542
Just let the rope slide.

Turn around! Right around!
That's the wrong way.

01:14:28.083 --> 01:14:29.875

College scouts must've
been tossin' hookers
through your bedroom window.

01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.500
Yeah, yeah. Just about.
I busted my knee
my senior year.

it blew my shot.

else you can do?

No, there's nothin' else
for me to do.

I was black and I played ball.
That's all anybody
ever cared about.

I'm keepin' that kid as far
away from the playin' field
as I can.

01:17:34.250 --> 01:17:38.375
Runnin' a football
never helped nobody pass
a civil service exam.

it never helped me.

Nah. He played for the 1400s.
The Renaissance.

01:18:01.583 --> 01:18:02.917
The what?

01:18:02.917 --> 01:18:05.083
He's what you'd call
a Renaissance man.

01:18:05.083 --> 01:18:09.917
The guy was an architect,
a writer, a painter,
a musician, a scholar...

01:18:09.917 --> 01:18:11.959
God knows what else.

01:18:11.959 --> 01:18:13.583
But you know what I remember
most about him?

01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:18.917
They say that he could
stand with his feet
together like this

01:18:18.917 --> 01:18:21.291
and spring straight over
a man's head.

01:18:22.917 --> 01:18:24.083
Really?
Yeah.

01:18:24.083 --> 01:18:27.125
If Leon Battista Alberti
couldn't have done that,

01:18:27.125 --> 01:18:29.291

a thing about him.

a smart jock, then, right?

That's right. You got it.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:39.000
Now, ain't that
an oxymoron?

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.959
That is. That is.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

01:18:52.792 --> 01:18:54.458

01:18:54.834 --> 01:18:56.583

01:19:09.959 --> 01:19:13.166
Well, it's like he says.
Denmark's a prison.

01:19:13.166 --> 01:19:16.875
Everybody's watchin' him
all the time, spyin' on him.

01:19:16.875 --> 01:19:18.041
If he thinks
Denmark's a prison,

01:19:18.041 --> 01:19:21.041
all he gotta do is
move to a trailer park.

01:19:21.041 --> 01:19:23.333

(WITH CUBAN ACCENT)
Okay, Tony,
shut the hell up, okay?

01:38:54.375 --> 01:38:56.000
Okay.
You're drivin' me
crazy, okay?

01:38:56.000 --> 01:38:57.208
Okay, okay. I said okay.

01:38:57.208 --> 01:39:00.041
Quiet, now.
One time you gotta
tell me. One time.

01:39:00.041 --> 01:39:01.458
Shut the hell up.

01:39:01.458 --> 01:39:04.834
Where'd you get that?
At the theater.
Relax, I paid for it.

01:39:27.708 --> 01:39:31.417
See, I need some information
about a soldier who served
in Vietnam.

01:39:31.417 --> 01:39:35.208
His name is
Brian Davis, Sr.
Okay.

01:39:35.208 --> 01:39:39.041
No, wait. It would be,
actually, Brian Davis.

01:39:39.041 --> 01:39:40.834
Grand Forks,
North Dakota.

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:43.583
Okay. Are you CID?

01:39:45.250 --> 01:39:48.542
Of course I'm CID.
Why else would I
be here, right?

01:39:48.875 --> 01:39:49.875
Right.

01:39:52.041 --> 01:39:53.750
Excuse me one second.

01:39:55.250 --> 01:39:57.208
Excuse me, Sergeant.
He needs some records...

01:39:57.208 --> 01:39:59.875
SERGEANT: Oh, he does, huh?
Okay, I'll handle it, then.

01:40:03.875 --> 01:40:04.834
Hi. No.

01:40:05.750 --> 01:40:06.792
What?

01:40:06.792 --> 01:40:08.375
She's not allowed
to access those files

01:40:08.375 --> 01:40:11.125
without prior authorization
from her supervisor.

01:40:11.125 --> 01:40:12.792
I'm her supervisor.

01:40:14.250 --> 01:40:16.875
(CHUCKLES)
But I just told her
I was CIP.

01:40:20.750 --> 01:40:21.708
CIT?

01:40:23.792 --> 01:40:24.750
CIG?

01:40:27.125 --> 01:40:29.208
"D."
"D."

01:40:29.208 --> 01:40:32.083
I'm CID. So, can I
get the records?

01:40:32.083 --> 01:40:34.250
(CHUCKLES) No.

01:40:34.250 --> 01:40:36.583
Aw, come on.
Is that all you ever say?

01:40:37.959 --> 01:40:38.875
No.

01:40:42.291 --> 01:40:44.708
Hmm.
A window of opportunity.

01:40:48.834 --> 01:40:49.792
Huh?

01:40:50.875 --> 01:40:51.792
No?

01:40:53.041 --> 01:40:54.667
(MOUTHING) No.

01:40:54.667 --> 01:40:58.125
Mr. Bill, why do we
need to know every
Tom, Dick, and Orsic

01:40:58.125 --> 01:40:59.625
in this play anyhow?

01:41:00.375 --> 01:41:04.625
A-ha. Melvin,
I'm glad you asked.

01:41:05.291 --> 01:41:08.625
Where you goin'?
No, no, no.

01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:10.959

01:41:13.166 --> 01:41:15.250
In four days,

01:41:15.250 --> 01:41:17.750
will be up in front
of the class,

facin' the firing squad.

01:41:20.333 --> 01:41:22.625
Who's doin' the shootin'?
Me.

01:41:22.625 --> 01:41:25.250
Hey, Bill, you ain't
never said nothin'
'bout no damn test.

01:41:25.250 --> 01:41:27.125
Nobody asked me.
I'm the teacher.

01:41:27.125 --> 01:41:28.417
My hands are
sweatin' already.

01:41:28.417 --> 01:41:31.500
Well, I thought
you was my boy, man.
Give us a ride here.

01:41:31.500 --> 01:41:34.542
No more rides, Montgomery.
No more free passes.

01:41:34.542 --> 01:41:37.875
Look, um, Mr. Rago,
we talked about this.
I'm not good at tests.

01:41:38.333 --> 01:41:40.875
(RECRUITS CHATTERING)

01:41:40.875 --> 01:41:41.834
Look!

01:41:43.041 --> 01:41:44.834
You are not dumb.

01:41:46.166 --> 01:41:47.959
But I need you
to know that.

01:41:49.166 --> 01:41:50.458
When you walk out that door,

01:41:50.458 --> 01:41:53.959
I want you to realize
that nobody gave you
anything.

01:41:55.875 --> 01:41:58.959
I want you to know
what it feels like
to make the grade

01:41:58.959 --> 01:42:00.667
all on your own.

01:42:02.166 --> 01:42:03.834
You can do it.

01:42:06.041 --> 01:42:07.667
I know it.

01:42:12.041 --> 01:42:14.708

Look, I need you
to fill these in

01:42:20.375 --> 01:42:21.708
and return 'em with
your attendance sheets
ASAP.

01:42:21.708 --> 01:42:25.166
I need 'em
for the boys' records.
They graduate next week.

01:42:25.166 --> 01:42:26.417
What is this?

01:42:26.417 --> 01:42:29.083
It's a certificate.
It says they've
completed the course.

01:42:29.083 --> 01:42:30.708
Oh!

01:42:31.208 --> 01:42:32.542
Well, they haven't. Not yet.

01:42:32.542 --> 01:42:34.750
I'll sign 'em
when they pass the test.

01:42:35.083 --> 01:42:36.417
Test? What test?

01:42:36.417 --> 01:42:38.208
I'm giving 'em a test
this Friday.

01:42:38.208 --> 01:42:41.542
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, no, you're not.
Oh, yes, I am.

01:42:41.542 --> 01:42:44.250
Bill, look, you don't
kid around with tests
in the army.

01:42:44.250 --> 01:42:45.458
Tests are
real things here.

01:42:45.458 --> 01:42:47.708
That's right,
including mine.

01:42:47.708 --> 01:42:51.250
Look, you've done your job.
The drill sergeants are
happy with your guys.

01:42:51.250 --> 01:42:53.291
They're makin' it
as soldiers.

01:42:53.291 --> 01:42:54.959
They don't need your test.

01:42:56.083 --> 01:42:57.375
You're wrong, Tom.

01:42:57.375 --> 01:42:59.417
If they pass it,
they'll know they
earned something.

01:42:59.417 --> 01:43:00.917
And if they flunk it,
they're gone.

01:43:00.917 --> 01:43:04.792
This isn't Princeton, Rago.
We don't have summer school.
You got it?

01:43:07.125 --> 01:43:08.917

you mean well.

01:43:16.458 --> 01:43:18.750

listen to me.

They're almost there.

01:43:22.542 --> 01:43:24.792
Don't do to them
what you did to Hobbs.

at the end of the play.
Now, that was good.

Yo, yo, yo.
Hey, Billy, my boy,
bust it.

have a last name or what?

I know you know.
You the man.

01:45:06.583 --> 01:45:10.000
Yup, yup, yup. We're gonna
go over everything.

01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:14.917
But, uh... But first
I have to talk to you
about something.

01:45:15.542 --> 01:45:18.041
Um, according to the army,

01:45:18.875 --> 01:45:23.875
(EXHALES) you're not
required to take a test
to pass this class.

01:45:24.291 --> 01:45:25.625
Hallelujah! Hey, yo!

01:45:25.625 --> 01:45:28.333

MELVIN: Thank you.
Well, you get an A+, too.
Now, hold on, Mr. Bill.

01:45:32.875 --> 01:45:36.708
What are you sayin' here,
that if we fail,
we still pass?

01:45:36.708 --> 01:45:42.083
No, no. If you take a test,
and you fail, you're out.

01:45:42.750 --> 01:45:45.208
You're out of the army.
Is that clear?

01:45:46.417 --> 01:45:47.959
What?

01:45:50.417 --> 01:45:51.625
What?

01:45:51.625 --> 01:45:55.125
Um, you said if
we take the test.

01:45:56.625 --> 01:45:58.917
Yeah, Davis.
The choice is yours.

01:45:58.917 --> 01:46:03.750
Hold on. Hold on, Billy.
How 'bout if we take
the test, pass the test?

01:46:03.750 --> 01:46:07.750
We get a bonus, we get,
like, keys to a car,
cash, a prize maybe?

01:46:07.750 --> 01:46:09.250
A little somethin'?
Some incentive?

01:46:11.250 --> 01:46:12.959
You get a prize.

01:46:14.208 --> 01:46:15.417
Yeah.

01:46:15.417 --> 01:46:17.208
But you can't drive it,

01:46:18.250 --> 01:46:20.041
or spend it,

01:46:20.458 --> 01:46:22.000
or even see it.

01:46:24.291 --> 01:46:26.125
All you can do is feel it.

01:46:28.667 --> 01:46:30.792

kind of prize is that?

01:46:30.792 --> 01:46:33.792

all right?
I need this job.

If you get any sadder,
you're gonna trip
over your lip.

01:46:52.667 --> 01:46:55.959
I'm sorry. I'm just not
a fun date tonight.

01:46:56.458 --> 01:46:58.667
Aw, just lighten up
a little bit.

Ah.
I have a lovely set
of 16 at home.

but maybe if I get
a bigger footlocker.

You're right, you know.

He probably will come out
wearin' a helmet.

01:47:51.542 --> 01:47:54.041
(CHUCKLES) Little joke.

01:47:54.583 --> 01:47:56.250
Yeah?
(CHUCKLES)

01:47:57.583 --> 01:48:00.208
These are for you.
Mr. Davis' records.

01:48:07.583 --> 01:48:10.041
Mr. Rago,
can you put it...

01:48:14.750 --> 01:48:18.166
MARIE: I would show it
to Sergeant Cass first.

Uh, I'm gonna...
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

01:48:36.750 --> 01:48:38.959
Looks like
things went well.
Yeah.

01:48:38.959 --> 01:48:41.542
Nice kiss?
Yes, it was. Thanks.

01:48:41.542 --> 01:48:42.417
Mmm-hmm.

01:48:47.250 --> 01:48:48.125
Oh.

CASS: Said weapon was found
approximately 50 yards
to my left,

01:48:58.792 --> 01:49:01.583
in a large puddle of water.

HAYWOOD: It's my rifle,
Drill Sergeant!

01:49:02.708 --> 01:49:05.250
CASS: Now, men, this is
totally unacceptable!

HAYWOOD:
Drill Sergeant, yes,
Drill Sergeant!

01:49:08.583 --> 01:49:10.667
Fall back in!
BILL: Lou!

01:49:10.667 --> 01:49:12.625

He ain't never stopped
to think about what type
of person Hamlet was.

01:56:34.208 --> 01:56:36.417
All he does is do what
the king tells him to do.

01:56:36.417 --> 01:56:39.542
When he fights Hamlet,
all they do is end up
killin' each other.

01:56:39.542 --> 01:56:43.250
That's his problem.
He don't stop and think
before he acts.

Well, maybe it means
something, maybe it don't,
but, um...

01:57:02.583 --> 01:57:05.041
Well, I can see why
the gravedigger say
he went to work

01:57:05.041 --> 01:57:07.375
the very day Hamlet was born.

01:57:07.375 --> 01:57:10.583
I mean...
Well, it's kinda funny
when you think about it.

01:57:11.250 --> 01:57:13.875
The day you're born,
you start to die.

01:57:17.417 --> 01:57:20.750
You see, when Hamlet
see that skull
in the graveyard,

01:57:21.125 --> 01:57:22.625
he see the light.

01:57:23.291 --> 01:57:25.458
Skull ain't got
no tongue, you see?

01:57:25.458 --> 01:57:28.291
That's why, later,
when Hamlet's
lyin' there, dyin',

01:57:28.291 --> 01:57:30.291
he won't let his man Horatio
kill himself.

01:57:30.291 --> 01:57:32.792
Say, "Nah, man.
I'm already gone.

01:57:33.458 --> 01:57:35.667
"Don't fall
on your sword for me.

Two times, baby.
Three times, my boy.

out of this play?

01:58:01.125 --> 01:58:02.625

all the people in the play,
the kings and the queens
and the princes,

01:58:07.125 --> 01:58:08.625
they all die.

01:58:08.625 --> 01:58:11.834
And in the end,
all that's left
is the two guys,

01:58:12.250 --> 01:58:14.667
Fortinbras and Horatio.

01:58:16.250 --> 01:58:18.708

That is something,
Melvin.

01:58:30.458 --> 01:58:32.542
Some eight or nine weeks ago,
a young man or woman

01:58:32.542 --> 01:58:36.667
apprehensively boarded
a train, plane,
or got into a car,

01:58:36.667 --> 01:58:40.291
and began a journey
to become a part
of something

01:58:40.291 --> 01:58:44.834
they only knew vaguely
as the army.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.583
That's Marie over there.

01:58:47.583 --> 01:58:50.125

go away to do something.
BILL: See?

01:58:50.125 --> 01:58:52.500
This is Emily.
My daughter.

01:58:52.500 --> 01:58:55.500
EMILY: Hi.
I met her here.

01:58:55.500 --> 01:58:57.375
Well, you could tell.
She's cute.

01:58:57.375 --> 01:58:59.583
Thank you.
Well, she's very nice.

01:58:59.583 --> 01:59:02.542
Today, we see them
on this graduation field.

01:59:02.542 --> 01:59:06.000
They are somehow
stronger, prouder,

01:59:07.041 --> 01:59:09.041
more mature, changed.

01:59:10.542 --> 01:59:13.375
Today, you fine
young men and women

01:59:13.375 --> 01:59:17.250
assume your positions as
guardians of America's future,

01:59:17.250 --> 01:59:19.291
and that future
looks bright indeed,

01:59:19.291 --> 01:59:22.000
for both you and your country.

01:59:22.708 --> 01:59:26.875
But we must never forget our
debt of gratitude to the past,

01:59:27.542 --> 01:59:30.875
and those who have served
the army so bravely

01:59:32.083 --> 01:59:33.708
and so well.

01:59:34.583 --> 01:59:38.083
That is why
I am especially proud

01:59:40.125 --> 01:59:41.917
to dedicate this ceremony

01:59:43.625 --> 01:59:47.792
to a fallen,
but not forgotten,
American hero.

01:59:49.583 --> 01:59:52.792
A young radio operator
serving in Vietnam,

01:59:52.792 --> 01:59:56.917
whose platoon came
under mortar attack near
the outpost at Soc Trang.

01:59:58.417 --> 02:00:01.750
This soldier held his post
under fire

02:00:02.417 --> 02:00:05.291
to relay coordinates,

02:00:05.291 --> 02:00:09.792
which facilitated
an artillery response.

02:00:10.417 --> 02:00:13.917
This soldier gave his own life

02:00:15.417 --> 02:00:17.834
in order to prevent the loss

02:00:18.458 --> 02:00:20.125
of so many others.

02:00:21.458 --> 02:00:24.291
I want to thank
a civilian instructor

02:00:24.291 --> 02:00:26.291
for pointing out
this oversight,

02:00:26.291 --> 02:00:28.792
Mr. William Rago,

02:00:30.667 --> 02:00:34.500
for his efforts
in seeing that the family
of this fallen soldier

02:00:34.500 --> 02:00:38.959
receives the honor
he so richly deserves.

02:00:43.417 --> 02:00:46.125
Company, attention!

02:01:06.333 --> 02:01:08.875

to present to you

02:01:09.500 --> 02:01:12.166
