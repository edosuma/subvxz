to this afternoon.

04:18.526 --> 04:20.328
Maggie, I already rescheduled
that patient twice.

04:20.361 --> 04:21.729
I double-checked
his labs.

04:21.762 --> 04:22.963
A few hours will not
change his status.

04:24.532 --> 04:26.266
Okay, uh, yeah,
I will get it all done.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.568

Uh--

04:36.276 --> 04:37.478
Uh...

put in a chest tube.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.748

in the room?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.683

watching you?

04:45.152 --> 04:47.287
One specifically has been
barking at me 24/7,

04:47.321 --> 04:49.790

she was still here.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.291

04:54.962 --> 04:56.330
I'm his intern today.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.768
You know, you might
want to find a new service.

05:00.801 --> 05:03.003
Yeah, Dr. Hunt used to be
chief of trauma,

05:03.036 --> 05:05.005
and then he lost his mind,
so now I'm chief of trauma.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.007
Yeah, also, she's my lovely wife
and mother of my children.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.876
Her favorite color
is blue.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.010
Did she really need
to know that?

05:10.043 --> 05:12.380
Yes.
To humanize you!

05:12.413 --> 05:14.615
According to the Washington
Medical Commission,

05:14.648 --> 05:17.050
if he attempts to do anything
on his own,

05:17.084 --> 05:19.687
he will be reported
and lose his medical license.

05:19.720 --> 05:21.789
Understood?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.290
Oh, so I'm supposed to...

05:23.323 --> 05:24.992
Call an additional attending
for the following--

05:25.025 --> 05:27.194
intubations,
chest tubes,

05:27.227 --> 05:30.297
surgical consults,
I&Ds, NG tubes,

05:30.330 --> 05:33.200
lap repairs, washouts...

05:33.233 --> 05:35.403

this isn't surgical.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.371

give up hope yet.

05:37.405 --> 05:39.573
So, when did the, uh--
the vomiting start?

05:39.607 --> 05:40.841
I can't remember.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.076
Any alcohol last night?
Drugs?

05:43.110 --> 05:45.746
We shared a few drinks
while playing "Barn Finders"

05:45.779 --> 05:47.748
at a friend's apartment. Oh.

05:47.781 --> 05:49.883
It's a video game.

05:49.917 --> 05:50.751
You play?
Sometimes.

05:50.784 --> 05:52.319
Not at all.

05:52.352 --> 05:54.187
Yeah, we got back
at like 3:00 a.m.,

05:54.221 --> 05:56.490
and, uh, we split
some leftover fried rice

05:56.524 --> 05:58.392
I had in my fridge.
It's from that place

05:58.426 --> 06:00.227
across the street
from the student union.

06:00.260 --> 06:02.596
We are never ordering
from there again.

06:04.465 --> 06:06.033
Any blood
in your vomit?

06:06.066 --> 06:08.702
I-I don't know. Here.

06:08.736 --> 06:11.672
Okay, well, we'll get you both
started on some IV fluids,

06:11.705 --> 06:13.240
and then we'll give you
another run--

06:13.273 --> 06:15.409
Okay, just-- Just stay calm.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.711
Okay? Take a deep breath

06:17.745 --> 06:19.447
Uh, Dr. Griffith,

06:19.480 --> 06:21.348

06:21.381 --> 06:22.850

06:22.883 --> 06:24.485

06:27.087 --> 06:28.522
Uh, hold on.
Hold on.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.693

I don't know.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.462

06:49.643 --> 06:50.010

06:53.947 --> 06:56.049

06:56.083 --> 06:58.719

06:58.752 --> 07:00.721
Uh, sanitizer, check.

07:00.754 --> 07:02.623
This is my kind of mom group.

07:02.656 --> 07:06.627

no power walking in full makeup

07:06.660 --> 07:09.129

07:09.162 --> 07:12.232
Alright, waters,
uh, baby wipes, yes,

07:12.265 --> 07:14.001
and, uh, sunscreen.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.736

07:15.769 --> 07:17.505
Not my first rodeo.

07:17.538 --> 07:20.407
Thank you so much for calling.
All I do is work

07:20.440 --> 07:23.611
and watch Link bring home
half the women in Seattle,

07:23.644 --> 07:26.013
which, you know, I'm not one
to judge a choice, but it--

07:26.046 --> 07:27.915
Uh-huh. Okay.
Look, if we hurry,

07:27.948 --> 07:29.950
the girls can go down the slide
while it's still in the shade.

07:29.983 --> 07:31.785
Oh. Uh, are we late?

07:31.819 --> 07:34.822
Yes. Let's power-walk.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.490
Okay.

07:42.162 --> 07:44.031
Did you page both of us?

07:44.064 --> 07:46.534
Uh, I paged Chief Grey.
I paged Dr. Webber.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.201
Did you happen to talk to
each other before doing that?

07:50.303 --> 07:52.339
Uh, never mind. Never mind.
Uh, what do you got?

07:52.372 --> 07:55.442
Um, 19-year-old male
with abdominal pain,
vomiting, and chills.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.210
He recently was
experiencing chest pain,

07:57.244 --> 07:59.379
shortness of breath, and a rash
on his abdomen and chest.

08:00.748 --> 08:01.715
Okay.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.285
What about him?

08:05.318 --> 08:06.353
College roommate.

08:06.386 --> 08:07.688
They ate the same thing

08:07.721 --> 08:09.289
four hours before
both presenting with

08:09.322 --> 08:10.991
food poisoning symptoms,

08:11.024 --> 08:14.227
but he hasn't developed a rash
or shortness of breath.

08:14.261 --> 08:17.998
It's on his legs
and his arms, also.

08:18.031 --> 08:20.534
Let's get blood cultures,
get a chest X-ray.

08:20.568 --> 08:23.637
Put him on high-flow oxygen.
Admit him to the ICU.

08:23.671 --> 08:26.840
Call internal medicine
and page us when you're done.

08:26.874 --> 08:28.676
<i>One</i> of us.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.581
Excuse me. Hi.

08:33.614 --> 08:36.416
Do I need
all that stuff, too?

08:36.449 --> 08:38.919
So, your intake form says that
you're experiencing

08:38.952 --> 08:40.220
abdominal discomfort,
Mr. Peters?

08:40.253 --> 08:41.822
Harold, please.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.724
But I may know what
the discomfort is from--

08:43.757 --> 08:46.727
There you are!
This hospital's a maze.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.328
Sharon, I told you
to wait in the car.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.197
And I told you I thought
that was a stupid idea.

08:50.230 --> 08:51.765
I still can't find my phone.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.567
What if the kids call
and need something?

08:53.601 --> 08:55.836
You won't be able to help
if you're on an operating table.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.537
What's wrong with him?
I'm fine.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.206
Probably an ulcer
or something.
He says that

08:59.239 --> 09:00.373
every time we're supposed
to go to my mother's.

09:00.407 --> 09:01.842
Your abdomen is distended,

09:01.875 --> 09:03.210
so I'm gonna have
to do an ultrasound

09:03.243 --> 09:05.779
to figure out
how to proceed, okay?

09:05.813 --> 09:07.347
I have three minutes.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.549
And I'm not sure
I'm gonna survive them.

09:09.583 --> 09:12.419
Do I need to remind you
why I'm here, Dr. Hunt?

09:12.452 --> 09:13.887
Well, it's been about 10 minutes
since the last time,

09:13.921 --> 09:15.923
so, sure,
knock yourself out.

09:15.956 --> 09:17.791
Are you <i>all</i> doctors?
Teddy, this is
just an ultrasound.

09:17.825 --> 09:20.227
So then it should go quick.
Hi, I'm Dr. Altman.

09:20.260 --> 09:22.562
Yes, we are all doctors.
And you're all necessary?

09:22.596 --> 09:24.364
No. You know what? Why don't
you just do this yourself?

09:24.397 --> 09:25.766
Well, if I were to do
everything myself,

09:25.799 --> 09:29.469
then no one would learn.
Would they?

09:29.502 --> 09:31.104
We're a teaching hospital.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.606
We should have gone
to Seattle Pres.

09:32.640 --> 09:35.042
Oh, geez.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.143
I'll be right back.

09:39.279 --> 09:40.914
Dr. Schmitt.

09:40.948 --> 09:42.716
I was supposed
to remove the drains

09:42.750 --> 09:45.218
from Dr. Ndugu's patient
an hour ago.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.387
I have to go round
on Webber's post-ops,

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
and the nurses keep
texting me angry emojis.

09:49.422 --> 09:50.958
I can't work for Dr. Hunt
because it means

09:50.991 --> 09:52.592
you're also working
for Dr. Altman,

09:52.626 --> 09:54.561
which means you're working
for velociraptors.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.329
They're vicious,
can snap in an instant,

09:56.363 --> 09:57.931
but there is
a mind-game component

09:57.965 --> 09:59.599
going on between those two
that is so deep,

09:59.633 --> 10:01.134
it might destroy
all of civilization.

10:01.168 --> 10:05.138
Short, succinct,
clear sentences.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.607
What?
I don't have time to pee,

10:07.641 --> 10:10.110
and you just said
so many words.

10:10.143 --> 10:11.845
Can I be on your service
instead of Dr. Hunt's?

10:11.879 --> 10:13.246
No.

10:13.280 --> 10:16.349
Now get back in there
and do your job.

10:19.352 --> 10:22.289
Thank you.
Hey. I just asked Winston

10:22.322 --> 10:24.925
if he could help on an anterior
approach for a spinal fusion,

10:24.958 --> 10:26.359
and he said
to check with you?

10:26.393 --> 10:27.995
He's monitoring
a few patients for me,

10:28.028 --> 10:29.930
and I may need an assist
on a TAVR.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.064
Well, I can assist
on the TAVR.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.001
Out.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.941
Is everything okay
with Winston?

10:40.974 --> 10:43.476
He seemed a little--
Was he doing his scissors talk?

10:43.510 --> 10:45.312
I don't know
what you mean.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.315
When Winston gets irritated,
he talks like scissors--

10:48.348 --> 10:50.517
Like, every word,
it sounds like snip, snip, snip.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.352
He wants to yell,
but he holds back,

10:52.385 --> 10:55.188
so he just cuts the air
with his words.

10:55.222 --> 10:56.223
I thought
he was mad at me.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.959
No, he's mad at me.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.294
I pushed his surgery
because I'm a perfectionist

11:01.328 --> 11:04.164
and I want perfection
for my patients.

11:04.197 --> 11:06.834
And there's no such thing
as perfection in interns,

11:06.867 --> 11:08.535
and there are still
no senior residents,

11:08.568 --> 11:10.804
so I ask perfect Winston.

11:10.838 --> 11:12.873
Yeah, well, I still need someone
to help on my spinal fusion,

11:12.906 --> 11:14.374
so you need to work
on all that.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.649
We do have
one senior resident.

11:22.682 --> 11:24.551
Dr. Schmitt.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.586
Page him.

11:26.619 --> 11:29.056
And don't eavesdrop on
my conversations.

11:32.125 --> 11:34.394
What happened?
He became completely unresponsive,

11:34.427 --> 11:37.064
and his pressure tanked.
The rash is now everywhere.

11:37.097 --> 11:41.034
Let's start him on pressors.
Push sux, etomidate.

11:41.068 --> 11:43.036
Get me an intubation tray.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.675
Two of you, come around here.
Stand behind me.

11:48.708 --> 11:51.178
Watch exactly what I'm doing.
You want to make sure

11:51.211 --> 11:53.781
you have full visualization
of the vocal cords.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.022
Griffith, come around
and listen for breath sounds.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
Bilateral breath sounds.
Okay, great job.

12:10.163 --> 12:11.631
Thank you.

12:14.768 --> 12:15.903
Uh, Chief Grey?!

12:31.584 --> 12:33.053
<i>♪ Well, your touch
holds me captive ♪</i>

12:33.086 --> 12:35.755
Hey, I need you
to come back to work now.

12:35.789 --> 12:36.723
I make more money here.

12:36.756 --> 12:38.625
You do not.

12:38.658 --> 12:42.662
Uh, as a resident, I made
around 55K a year, before taxes,

12:42.695 --> 12:45.065
when I regularly worked
80-hour weeks,

12:45.098 --> 12:46.466
and weekends
and holidays.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.435
The math sucks, Levi.
Not to mention

12:48.468 --> 12:50.570
I didn't love the stress
that came with it.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.573
If I make a mistake here,
nobody dies.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.843
Taryn,
you are a surgeon.

12:55.876 --> 12:57.510
I <i>was</i> a surgeon.

12:57.544 --> 12:59.813
Now I'm a bartender

12:59.847 --> 13:01.815
and you're on
the vagina squad.

13:01.849 --> 13:04.684
Was!
I <i>was</i> on the vagina squad.

13:04.717 --> 13:07.287
Now I am chief resident,
general surgery.

13:07.320 --> 13:09.356
Only because
I'm not coming back.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.158
Disagree.

13:11.191 --> 13:13.360
So come back
and prove me wrong.

13:13.393 --> 13:14.461
No.

13:16.830 --> 13:17.931
Grey wants you back.

13:17.965 --> 13:19.967
Did she say that?

13:21.534 --> 13:23.036
Meredith is straight,

13:23.070 --> 13:25.172
and I have enough
self-esteem now to know

13:25.205 --> 13:27.975
to only fall for women
who might love me back.

13:28.008 --> 13:30.377
So, thanks,
but no thanks.

13:30.410 --> 13:32.345
Wow.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.147
Bartending really is
good for you, huh?

13:34.181 --> 13:35.548
Right?

13:35.582 --> 13:37.317
Please come back anyway.

13:37.350 --> 13:38.718
No!
Oh!

13:40.220 --> 13:41.788
Ugh!

13:41.821 --> 13:43.690
I'm coming, Dr. Pierce.

13:43.723 --> 13:44.858
Bye.

13:48.495 --> 13:52.232
Initially presented
like textbook food poisoning,

13:52.265 --> 13:54.401
and then evolved into
septic shock within hours.

13:54.434 --> 13:55.802
Do we have the source
of infection?

13:55.835 --> 13:57.504
Uh, no. Not yet.

13:57.537 --> 14:00.073
His chest X-ray shows
bilateral pleural effusions,

14:00.107 --> 14:01.975
and he's exhibiting
signs of DIC.

14:02.009 --> 14:05.312
The rash is non-blanching.
It could be petechiae.

14:05.345 --> 14:07.080
I initially thought it was
Steven Johnson Syndrome,

14:07.114 --> 14:08.815
but the rash
doesn't peel with pressure.

14:08.848 --> 14:11.051
Any case reports
of <i>Bacillus cereus</i>

14:11.084 --> 14:13.320
and sepsis after eating rice?
It's not <i>Bacillus cereus.</i>

14:13.353 --> 14:14.754
It's not food poisoning
at all.

14:16.756 --> 14:19.092
Have any of you ever seen a
patient bleed from every orifice

14:19.126 --> 14:20.928
after eating
bad leftover rice?

14:20.961 --> 14:22.595
Well, then solve it.
What?

14:22.629 --> 14:24.397
You and Millin
and the rest of the interns,

14:24.431 --> 14:27.034
hit the research
and figure it out.

14:27.067 --> 14:28.268
Before it's too late.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.075
Hello, Altman.

14:35.108 --> 14:38.078
Well, I'm glad you and Hunt
decided to come back.

14:38.111 --> 14:41.448
I imagine it's hard
with everything he has
to go through right now.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.883
Let me guess. Owen thinks that
I'm drinking too much,

14:43.917 --> 14:45.852
so he asked you
to intervene.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.454
Thanks. I'm good.

14:47.487 --> 14:50.357
I was just asking
how you were doing.

14:50.390 --> 14:53.260
Well, I have spent the last
six months on my feet

14:53.293 --> 14:55.295
working locum tenens
in L.A.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.630
while Owen developed
an artistic penchant

14:57.664 --> 14:59.866
for building sand castles,
which was fun for the kids,

14:59.899 --> 15:02.702
but, honestly, the sand castles
were pretty basic.

15:02.735 --> 15:05.205
And since his legal team
bankrupted us,

15:05.238 --> 15:08.408
Owen and I now have lengthy
arguments about important topics

15:08.441 --> 15:11.945
like whether to buy name-brand
or store-brand shampoo.

15:11.979 --> 15:14.747
Every time I look at his face,
I am filled with such annoyance

15:14.781 --> 15:17.550
that I have to go outside
and pretend to garden

15:17.584 --> 15:20.220
when, really, my kids are
just seeing me rip up plants.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.788
The worst part
of all of it is--

15:21.821 --> 15:24.324
is that I still
don't want to leave him

15:24.357 --> 15:26.126
because he's the father
of my kids,

15:26.159 --> 15:29.329
and somewhere really deep down
inside, I still love him.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.098
And wine helps me
remember that,

15:31.131 --> 15:33.400
so I drink three glasses
a night.

15:33.433 --> 15:34.734
But never at work.

15:34.767 --> 15:36.103
And the kids are in bed
by 8:00,

15:36.136 --> 15:37.504
and I don't get
behind the wheel.

15:37.537 --> 15:39.006
I mean, the riskiest thing
that I may do

15:39.039 --> 15:41.008
is watch too many
puppy videos at night.

15:41.041 --> 15:42.175
Is that a problem
for you, sir?

15:46.213 --> 15:47.947
Always good
to see you, Altman.

15:51.384 --> 15:53.653
Hey! Adams.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.155
Dr. Shepherd.

15:55.188 --> 15:57.924
I wanted
to run something by you.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.659
About a patient.

15:59.692 --> 16:00.660
I'll catch up.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.368
I found you
some apartments to see.

16:08.401 --> 16:09.636
Mom always said
you were the best liar.

16:09.669 --> 16:10.837
That was bad lying.

16:10.870 --> 16:12.872
Wait, is that a loft?
Eh, kinda.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.641
I think there's some creative
license with the advertising,

16:14.674 --> 16:16.209
but it's near Meredith's.

16:16.243 --> 16:17.977
Uh, great,
send it to me.

16:18.011 --> 16:20.813
You can visit, see the kids,
eat for free.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.450
You won't see <i>me</i> cook,
but Meredith's pretty good,

16:23.483 --> 16:24.817
and Maggie makes dinner
on Sundays.

16:24.851 --> 16:26.819
Hey, can you not
walk so close?

16:26.853 --> 16:27.887
What's wrong with you?

16:27.920 --> 16:30.657
You're hovering.
I'm helping.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.225
The more people see us together,
the easier it's gonna be

16:32.259 --> 16:33.960
for them to figure out
we're related.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.362
I've already been designated
the screw-up.

16:35.395 --> 16:37.997
Please don't make it worse. Bye.

16:38.031 --> 16:39.732
You know, it could be
toxic shock syndrome.

16:39.766 --> 16:41.368
That would explain
the rash.

16:41.401 --> 16:44.337
But there's no liver
or renal dysfunction.

16:44.371 --> 16:46.373
Have you considered
erythema multiforme?

16:46.406 --> 16:49.376
No one asked you.
<i>I</i> asked him.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.710
What?
Chief Grey told us to.

16:50.743 --> 16:52.579
I will ask everyone

16:52.612 --> 16:54.381
if it prevents my name
going on a death certificate.

16:54.414 --> 16:57.250
So, who's dying?
How can we help?

16:57.284 --> 16:59.919
It's a 19-year-old male,
ate leftover fried rice,

16:59.952 --> 17:01.854
vomited for six hours,

17:01.888 --> 17:03.990
a generalized, purple,
star-shaped rash

17:04.023 --> 17:06.259
all over his body, and is now
in full-blown septic shock.

17:06.293 --> 17:07.260
Ah, he looks
pretty dead already.

17:07.294 --> 17:08.695
That's from bad rice?

17:08.728 --> 17:11.231
I've never seen
so much vomit,

17:11.264 --> 17:13.166
and my parents did
a lot of hallucinogens.

17:13.200 --> 17:16.903
And it was like a--
like a rainbow of vomit.

17:16.936 --> 17:19.106
Like red-brown,
yellow-green, bilious.

17:19.139 --> 17:20.907
I'm done.
DRESS syndrome?

17:20.940 --> 17:22.275
No. He doesn't take
any meds,

17:22.309 --> 17:24.344
and his eosinophil count
is normal.

17:24.377 --> 17:26.113
- Kawasaki disease?
- No.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.450
Ugh. I have to go
find an attending

17:30.483 --> 17:32.619
to supervise my attending
so they can supervise

17:32.652 --> 17:34.521
me learning nothing.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.888
Have fun.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.424
Rickettsial disease?
No.

17:37.457 --> 17:39.058
It's not even your case.

17:39.092 --> 17:40.227
Well, that should tell you
how wrong you are.

17:42.162 --> 17:45.265
Harold, so, your ultrasound
didn't show any abnormalities,

17:45.298 --> 17:48.268
so we're gonna do a CT scan
to get a better look, okay?

17:48.301 --> 17:50.370
Is it possible
to get some privacy?

17:50.403 --> 17:53.140
You and I? Without--
Oh, um, Dr. Yasuda,

17:53.173 --> 17:54.807
can you take Mrs. Peters
to grab a coffee?

17:54.841 --> 17:57.110
Yeah. Mrs. Peters,
if you would just follow me--

17:57.144 --> 17:59.446
Oh! It's here.

17:59.479 --> 18:02.048
I used the app to locate
my phone. It's in here.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.150
Let me call it.
Sharon, please--

18:03.183 --> 18:04.551
Ah, Harold,
give me two seconds,

18:04.584 --> 18:06.253
and you can be alone
all you want.

18:06.286 --> 18:07.787
I really need you to leave.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.888
Sharon!

18:08.921 --> 18:10.490
Shh-shh-shh-shh.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.561
Oh, for God's sake,
are you sitting on it?

18:14.594 --> 18:16.996
It sounds like it's coming
directly from yo--

18:17.029 --> 18:18.498
Mm.
Harold,

18:18.531 --> 18:20.767
did you stick my phone
up your ass?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.235
Please say no.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.171
You're always
on the damn thing!

18:24.204 --> 18:25.405
Oh, my God.
We don't even know

18:25.438 --> 18:26.806
what your face
looks like anymore

18:26.839 --> 18:28.608
'cause you're glued
to social media!

18:28.641 --> 18:30.009
Unbelievable.

18:30.042 --> 18:31.644
Ow!
Oh, my God!

18:31.678 --> 18:34.113
Page Dr. Altman
so I can retrieve

18:34.147 --> 18:35.114
the
phone.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.116
Hang it up!
Yeah. Oh, oh, God.

18:45.592 --> 18:46.659
So, are things at least
improving at Grey-Sloan?

18:49.996 --> 18:52.765
How are you doing it?
Doing what?

18:52.799 --> 18:55.202
Not breaking things

18:55.235 --> 18:58.338
and sobbing uncontrollably
and screaming in public

18:58.371 --> 19:00.173
every time
you look at Pru's face

19:00.207 --> 19:02.008
and think about the world
that she's growing up in?

19:05.678 --> 19:08.548
I try to remember
she's already lost one parent,

19:08.581 --> 19:12.219
and if I did something
to get myself arrested,

19:12.252 --> 19:15.455
no one would be there

19:15.488 --> 19:18.558
to read her
"The Pout-Pout Fish" at bedtime.

19:18.591 --> 19:20.827
I mean, Ben,
he just reads the words.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.495
I do it with the rhythm.

19:26.533 --> 19:29.402
Carina and I
did extend our clinic hours

19:29.436 --> 19:31.571
to accommodate the patients
from out of state.

19:31.604 --> 19:36.042
Oh. Are you having to pick up
more hours in surgery,

19:36.075 --> 19:39.246
or has that calmed down
now that the interns are back?

19:39.279 --> 19:40.880
No!

19:40.913 --> 19:42.882
What?
I thought you wanted

19:42.915 --> 19:44.917
to be my mom friend.

19:44.951 --> 19:47.153
I'm just making conversation.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.856
You are using me for
information about the hospital.

19:49.889 --> 19:53.393
You want me to be
your Deep Throat!

19:53.426 --> 19:55.595
I prefer Delta Source...

19:55.628 --> 19:57.397
...an Imperial
intelligence source

19:57.430 --> 20:00.199
during the early years
of the New Republic.

20:02.535 --> 20:04.070
Well, you gonna talk
or not?

20:09.642 --> 20:11.010
Alright, Harold,
let me know

20:11.043 --> 20:12.412
if you feel
any discomfort, okay?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.613
Physical or emotional?

20:13.646 --> 20:15.114
Uh, we're gonna be fast.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.250
Okay, Yasuda,
I need you to press hard

20:17.284 --> 20:18.585
on the lower left
quadrant, okay?

20:18.618 --> 20:20.453
Don't forget gloves.

20:20.487 --> 20:22.054
I'm beginning to understand
why you did this, Harold.

20:22.088 --> 20:24.424
What?
Okay, ready here.

20:24.457 --> 20:26.793
Okay, here we go.
Now, Harold,

20:26.826 --> 20:28.628
I'm gonna need you
to bear down.

20:28.661 --> 20:30.530
No one should ever say that
to another human being.

20:30.563 --> 20:31.898
And push.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.868
Alright, try forceps
or a balloon catheter.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.304
Push harder, Harold.

20:40.807 --> 20:42.409
Owen, if you can't grasp it,

20:42.442 --> 20:43.543
he's gonna have to go
to the operating room.

20:45.478 --> 20:47.280
You wanna take that
to his wife?

20:47.314 --> 20:48.548
Hmm?

20:52.519 --> 20:55.221
I'm the guy who killed
his college roommate.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.756
They're gonna make
podcasts about me.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.291
He is not dead.

20:58.325 --> 20:59.992
And I believe
we can save him

21:00.026 --> 21:02.228
once we know exactly
how to treat him.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.564
Can you tell me
anything you know about him?

21:04.597 --> 21:07.500
Um, he's from Massachusetts.
Parents are divorced,

21:07.534 --> 21:09.969
and I don't ask about it
'cause my parents are divorced

21:10.002 --> 21:11.404
and I don't like
talking about it.

21:11.438 --> 21:13.239
Uh, he's a history major,

21:13.272 --> 21:15.608
loves sports documentaries,
hates coffee, I mean--

21:15.642 --> 21:17.677
Anything you know
about his health.

21:17.710 --> 21:20.112
Oh. Um...

21:20.146 --> 21:21.981
He had syphilis once.

21:29.522 --> 21:30.323
Hello.

21:32.492 --> 21:34.361
Hey.
Hi.

21:34.394 --> 21:36.929
How was the, uh,
kidney transplant?

21:36.963 --> 21:38.331
Uh, well,
it's making urine already,

21:38.365 --> 21:40.299
so, you know, on par. Good.

21:40.333 --> 21:42.469
Yeah.
Good.

21:42.502 --> 21:44.537
And you're liking
the, um, new position?

21:44.571 --> 21:46.272
I saw all the changes
that you made.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.508
Yeah. Uh,
is there an issue?

21:48.541 --> 21:49.542
Not at all.

21:49.576 --> 21:52.512
Okay, good.

21:52.545 --> 21:53.680
Where are you staying?

21:53.713 --> 21:55.281
You know,
same place on Union.

21:55.314 --> 21:57.384
Oh.
I like that place.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.284
Yeah, you're acting
a little weird.

21:58.317 --> 22:00.653
Excuse me. Chief Grey?
Yes.

22:00.687 --> 22:02.889
Um, it's Chase.

22:02.922 --> 22:04.557
Oh. Okay. Sorry.

22:04.591 --> 22:06.859
Good luck. Sorry.

22:06.893 --> 22:09.295
His foot's cold,
and I can't get a Doppler signal

22:09.328 --> 22:11.163
anywhere below the knee.
We don't make a move,

22:11.197 --> 22:13.132
this leg could
turn gangrenous.

22:13.165 --> 22:15.735
Any family around?

22:15.768 --> 22:18.805
His mother is on a plane
as we speak.

22:18.838 --> 22:21.908
Well, if she wants
to see her son alive,

22:21.941 --> 22:23.810
that leg's gotta go.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.978
You have to amputate?

22:26.012 --> 22:28.014
<i>You</i> do.

22:28.047 --> 22:30.082
I'm sorry, what?
Cutting something off

22:30.116 --> 22:32.084
is way easier
than reattaching it.

22:32.118 --> 22:33.586
Get him prepped
and upstairs.

22:40.460 --> 22:43.496
Advance the guide wire
carefully to the aortic annulus.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.097
It's very angulated here.

22:45.131 --> 22:46.098
I don't want
to injure anything.

22:46.132 --> 22:48.200
It's okay. Just go slowly.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.368
There. Good.

22:49.402 --> 22:50.937
Schmitt,
why aren't you in O.R. 4?

22:50.970 --> 22:53.239
Because I am trying really hard
not to injure

22:53.272 --> 22:55.842
this man's vasculature
in <i>thi</i> O.R.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.777
You prepped and studied
for my VATS lobectomy.

22:57.810 --> 23:00.246
And if I remember correctly,
you begged to be my assist.

23:00.279 --> 23:01.781
If you were supposed
to be his assist,

23:01.814 --> 23:03.249
then why are you
in here being mine?

23:03.282 --> 23:05.117
The schedule
changed so much.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.953
And you are
chief of cardio.

23:06.986 --> 23:11.290
And I play Dungeons & Dragons,
so I follow hierarchy.

23:11.323 --> 23:13.693
And for the record,
I'm very tired.

23:13.726 --> 23:16.062
Please don't say that
with your hands in my patient.

23:16.095 --> 23:17.363
I thought
I was helping you.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.065
By taking my assist
to be yours?

23:19.098 --> 23:20.266
Winston--
Alright, you know what?

23:20.299 --> 23:22.702
I'll reschedule
the lobectomy again.

23:32.178 --> 23:32.344
Hi.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.048
Oh, uh, Marsh. Yeah.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.051
What exactly is
"mini Grand Rounds,"

23:39.085 --> 23:40.887
and why was I invited?

23:40.920 --> 23:42.589
Uh, we did them
in Minnesota.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.891
Interns take turns presenting
on cases to their class.

23:44.924 --> 23:47.426
It helps their skills for rounds
and future lecture capabilities.

23:47.460 --> 23:48.828
So it's good.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.229
Well, what am <i>I</i>
supposed to do?

23:50.262 --> 23:51.498
Well, I thought
you could be there

23:51.531 --> 23:52.899
to help me
provide feedback.

23:52.932 --> 23:55.134
Look,
is this gonna be a thing?

23:55.167 --> 23:57.436
Someone questions me every time
I make a change to the program?

23:57.470 --> 23:59.806
Because I kinda thought
that's why I was hired here.

24:02.542 --> 24:05.478
Look, um, six months ago,

24:05.512 --> 24:08.815
I was trying everything I could
to save this place.

24:08.848 --> 24:10.449
My wife wasn't doing well.

24:10.483 --> 24:13.085
I blamed you for Meredith
going to Minnesota.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.754
I wasn't my best self.

24:14.787 --> 24:16.989
I've already apologized
to Meredith about it.

24:17.023 --> 24:21.193
And, um, well,
you deserve the same.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.695
I'm sorry.

24:22.729 --> 24:26.365
I appreciate that,
Dr. Webber, I do, but...

24:26.398 --> 24:28.167
it does kinda feel like
there's more here.

24:28.200 --> 24:30.703
Oh, no. N--

24:30.737 --> 24:32.438
Well, okay, yes.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.941
Um,
it's none of my business,

24:34.974 --> 24:38.377
and I'm not exactly sure what
happened between the two of you,

24:38.410 --> 24:42.048
but, um, she's worth
taking a job for.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.783
If that's why you did it.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.386
And I'd be honored
to join you for feedback.

24:48.521 --> 24:50.356
Okay.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.692
Oh, and, uh, Marsh, uh,

24:52.725 --> 24:54.360

Ah, do they back-seat-drive

25:20.052 --> 25:22.855
What is that
a euphemism for?

25:22.889 --> 25:26.325
Nothing. I literally just
experienced that with
Dr. Altman and Dr. Hunt.

25:26.358 --> 25:27.694
Why is everyone married
to each other?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.596
Because doctors
have no lives

That is not me flirting.

He just started breathing
really hard,

26:35.628 --> 26:37.329
then he made
this choking sound.

26:37.363 --> 26:38.765
Is he dead?
He's in cardiac arrest.

26:38.798 --> 26:40.466
He needs to be intubated.
Should I get Dr. Altman?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.001
No, there's no time.
Mrs. Peters,

26:42.034 --> 26:44.170
I need you to step outside.
But Harold--

26:44.203 --> 26:45.137
We're gonna take care
of him, okay?

26:45.171 --> 26:46.572
Wait, you're gonna do it?
Nope.

26:46.605 --> 26:47.640
I'm gonna walk you
through it now.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.108
Switch with me.

26:51.978 --> 26:53.913
Okay, don't over-think this, Yasuda.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.748
Make sure you have everything
ready that you need.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.249
Test the tube.

26:57.283 --> 27:00.653
Tube looks good. Stylet.

27:00.687 --> 27:02.621
Okay, grab the scope.

27:02.655 --> 27:04.256
Okay. Other way.

27:04.290 --> 27:05.692
Ah, sorry.
Visualize the cords.

27:05.725 --> 27:07.593
Okay.
Ready?

27:07.626 --> 27:09.762
Okay. I can see them.
Take the tube. Insert it.

27:09.796 --> 27:12.665
We don't have much time here,
so one fluid motion.

27:12.699 --> 27:13.800
Trust your instincts
on the angle.

27:13.833 --> 27:15.601
I got it through.

27:17.536 --> 27:18.637
Cuffs up.

27:18.671 --> 27:19.806
Let's start bagging.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.073
Well?

27:23.409 --> 27:25.177
Breath sounds
on both sides.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.146
Breath sounds on both sides.
Nice work, Yasuda.

27:27.179 --> 27:29.048
Airway is secured.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.017
All we need to do now is, uh,
get his circulation back.

27:31.050 --> 27:32.618
Good job.

27:32.651 --> 27:34.353
I requested a single room.

27:34.386 --> 27:35.688
Grew up an only child

27:35.722 --> 27:39.458
and have-- or had--
social anxiety.

27:39.491 --> 27:42.795
Dreaded meeting new people,
large parties.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.997
Anytime I got an e-mail
during orientation

27:45.031 --> 27:49.068
with the word "mixer" in
the subject line, I-I panicked.

27:49.101 --> 27:51.670
Then Student Services
assigned me a roommate.

27:51.704 --> 27:54.040
And I almost dropped out.

27:54.073 --> 27:56.208
Till I met Chase.

27:56.242 --> 27:57.744
I know this is gonna sound
really weird,

27:57.777 --> 28:00.379
but you know those
emotional support animals

28:00.412 --> 28:02.414
for people who can't handle
crowded places?

28:02.448 --> 28:04.917
You're comparing him
to... a dog.

28:04.951 --> 28:06.986
He fixed all my issues!

28:07.019 --> 28:09.922
I mean, he-- he showed me how
to walk up to a group of people

28:09.956 --> 28:11.891
and actually talk to them.

28:11.924 --> 28:13.359
We haven't gotten into
a single fight,

28:13.392 --> 28:15.061
and we basically live
on top of each other

28:15.094 --> 28:16.495
inside of
a crowded dorm.

28:16.528 --> 28:20.833
I mean, we've had colds
together, flu, athlete's foot,

28:20.867 --> 28:21.901
which I don't know
if you've had, but--

28:21.934 --> 28:24.737
Crowded dorm.

28:24.771 --> 28:25.905
Do you know
if Chase received

28:25.938 --> 28:28.040
all of his childhood
vaccinations?

28:28.074 --> 28:31.077
I don't know. Why?

28:31.110 --> 28:32.611
I-Is he gonna be okay?

28:32.644 --> 28:34.513
I hope so!

28:34.546 --> 28:37.116
I know this goes against
everything you've been taught,

28:37.149 --> 28:38.918
but you need
to cut harder.

28:38.951 --> 28:42.354
All the way through the joint,
layer by layer.

28:44.123 --> 28:45.291
Griffith?
The food poisoning

28:45.324 --> 28:47.293
was a distractor.
Chase has meningococcus.

28:47.326 --> 28:49.195
His cultures came back?
Not finalized,

28:49.228 --> 28:51.530
but I checked his records.
He was never vaccinated for it,

28:51.563 --> 28:53.532
and his gram stain is showing
gram-negative diplococci.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.768
Meningococcus would explain
the septic shock.

28:55.802 --> 28:57.770
Not to mention,
it's common in college--
College dorms.

28:57.804 --> 28:59.738
There's too much blood.
I-I can't control the bleeding.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.074
Oh, God. He's not clotting
properly due to the DIC.

29:02.108 --> 29:03.910
Damn it.
I did everything you told me to!

29:03.943 --> 29:05.945
Clamp.
Elevate the leg.

29:05.978 --> 29:07.413
Turn up the tourniquet.

29:07.446 --> 29:08.414
Clamp.

29:17.456 --> 29:18.224
So residents now get
free weekly lunch...

29:20.793 --> 29:22.394
Mm-hmm.
...attending mentors,

29:22.428 --> 29:24.296
and an extra hour
of sleep?

29:24.330 --> 29:26.165
Mm-hmm.
And let me guess,

29:26.198 --> 29:28.400
there's a pinball machine
in the locker room now, too?

29:28.434 --> 29:30.837
No.
Oh, but I did hear a rumor

29:30.870 --> 29:33.405
about monthly passes
to a yoga studio.

29:35.107 --> 29:36.775
You think the program's
gone soft.

29:36.809 --> 29:40.146
No. I think it's finally headed
in the right direction.

29:40.179 --> 29:43.149
I'm angry because
I tried

29:43.182 --> 29:46.318
to implement similar changes
at various times

29:46.352 --> 29:48.287
and was always met
with resistance.

29:48.320 --> 29:50.356
You're allowed
to change your mind.

29:50.389 --> 29:51.958
If you miss it,
you can come back.

29:55.995 --> 29:59.198
I started a garden
at Pru's preschool.

29:59.231 --> 30:02.368
We planted daffodils
and sunflowers

30:02.401 --> 30:04.136
and talked about
plant life cycles

30:04.170 --> 30:06.605
and how when you
plant a seed,

30:06.638 --> 30:09.475
the roots have to grow first,
before anything else.

30:12.744 --> 30:16.782
I wrote a sex education program
with a community clinic.

30:16.815 --> 30:21.187
I'm answering phones
for a women's organization.

30:21.220 --> 30:23.555
I am planting seeds.

30:23.589 --> 30:25.958
Growing roots.

30:25.992 --> 30:28.394
I-I think I'm following,
but--

30:28.427 --> 30:30.362
I'm still not ready.

30:30.396 --> 30:32.498
You're still not ready. No.

30:32.531 --> 30:34.466
Okay.

30:36.735 --> 30:39.171
But, Wilson...

30:39.205 --> 30:42.174
I do count you
as a mom friend.

30:50.883 --> 30:52.384
Altman paged me.
What do you got?

30:52.418 --> 30:54.653
A central line.
I can't do it on my own.

30:54.686 --> 30:56.522
Alright, okay.
You go ahead, Hunt.

30:56.555 --> 30:59.225
Okay. Thank you.

30:59.258 --> 31:01.193
I'm sure she loves
every moment of this.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.495
You know,
she considers this payback

31:03.529 --> 31:06.598
for the past six months
when I wasn't able to work.

31:06.632 --> 31:08.667
I mean,
I was miserable, Richard.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.602
I'm a trauma surgeon
who was trained in the military.

31:10.636 --> 31:12.704
I am wired to work.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.907
So instead of
sitting around drinking

31:14.941 --> 31:16.575
and looking at people
with hate,

31:16.608 --> 31:19.378
I surfed
to distract myself.

31:19.411 --> 31:23.015
I built sand castles
to entertain my kids.

31:23.049 --> 31:26.685
I wrote letters to Congress in
support of burn pit legislation.

31:26.718 --> 31:28.687
And I maybe chose

31:28.720 --> 31:30.422
the most expensive attorney
that I could find

31:30.456 --> 31:32.791
to get my career back.
And you know what's hilarious?

31:32.824 --> 31:34.393
She's the one who said
that we should run.

31:34.426 --> 31:37.096
And I listened 'cause
she's my wife and I love her.

31:37.129 --> 31:38.464
I love her
despite the fact

31:38.497 --> 31:41.400
that she highlights
our credit-card bill balance

31:41.433 --> 31:43.635
and posts it on the fridge
just so I don't forget

31:43.669 --> 31:44.636
that we're broke.

31:44.670 --> 31:46.438
So now, not only am I

31:46.472 --> 31:48.307
living with someone
who resents me at home,

31:48.340 --> 31:51.110
she stands over me
every second here at work.

31:53.645 --> 31:55.314
Line's in.

31:55.347 --> 31:57.116
Um...

31:57.149 --> 32:02.054
I-I suggest you find
some physical space.

32:02.088 --> 32:04.523
Yeah.
You got any ideas?

32:06.025 --> 32:10.362
<i>Dr. Gear to the E.R., stat.
Dr. Gear to the E.R., stat.</i>

32:11.998 --> 32:15.734
I'm sorry
I messed up your schedule.

32:15.767 --> 32:17.836
Today,
or the past six months?

32:20.806 --> 32:23.409
I know I've leaned on you,
and I-I'm sorry,

32:23.442 --> 32:27.413
but you are so talented,
and I needed that in my O.R.

32:27.446 --> 32:30.749
I needed to be able
to trust the person
standing next to me.

32:30.782 --> 32:32.084
And we didn't have
any residents.

32:32.118 --> 32:33.952
Now we do.
We have <i>interns.</i>

32:33.986 --> 32:35.454
Okay. That makes it okay
to treat me

32:35.487 --> 32:37.656
the way you used to treat me
back when we were at Tufts?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.491
As your resident?

32:39.525 --> 32:41.493
Of course not.

32:41.527 --> 32:44.196
Why do you think
I'm so talented, Maggie?

32:44.230 --> 32:46.332
Because you-- you are.

32:46.365 --> 32:47.933
I mean, you've studied.

32:47.966 --> 32:50.136
You've practiced.
You work really hard.

32:50.169 --> 32:53.139
I had a good teacher.
That's why.

32:53.172 --> 32:55.674
And you can't expect everyone
to be as good as you and me

32:55.707 --> 32:56.942
unless you teach them.

32:56.975 --> 32:58.177
Unless <i>we</i> teach them.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.611
And I can't do that

32:59.645 --> 33:01.513
if you're constantly
pulling me off my cases.

33:01.547 --> 33:03.615
It's not fair to me.
It's not fair to my patients.

33:03.649 --> 33:05.351
It's not fair
to this next class.

33:05.384 --> 33:06.985
Okay.

33:07.019 --> 33:09.021
Okay?

33:09.055 --> 33:11.523
I really am
a good teacher, aren't I?

33:14.826 --> 33:17.329
Just don't let them
fall in love with you.

33:17.363 --> 33:19.665
Because--

33:27.873 --> 33:29.741
He looks awful.
* Stony roads uphill

33:29.775 --> 33:32.044
But he's alive.

33:32.078 --> 33:34.646
And he doesn't have a leg?
From the knee down.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.183
But you can live without a leg.
And he has that option now.

33:37.216 --> 33:39.885
Due to Dr. Griffith's
quick thinking.

33:39.918 --> 33:42.388
The culture came back
for meningococcus.

33:42.421 --> 33:45.424
His mom should be here soon,
but you can go and sit with him

33:45.457 --> 33:48.026
so long as we get you
gowned and gloved.

33:48.060 --> 33:49.595

for the, um,
"Lunch & Learns."

35:18.384 --> 35:20.686
What is a Lunch & Learn?
Well, the department

35:20.719 --> 35:23.955
provides the interns protected
time for lunch once a week,

35:23.989 --> 35:27.459

will lecture.

Wha-- You thought what?

I-I kind of need you
to say it here, Meredith.

35:44.743 --> 35:46.845
You need me to say what?

35:46.878 --> 35:48.380
Great, you're both here.

35:48.414 --> 35:49.515
We're in the middle
of something right now.

35:49.548 --> 35:50.849
I can't work for Teddy.

35:50.882 --> 35:52.784
It's been a day.
It's been a week.

35:52.818 --> 35:55.354
But anyway, I talked an intern
through an intubation today,

35:55.387 --> 35:56.822
and I was
pretty damn good at it,

35:56.855 --> 35:58.824
so let me be a teacher
for these next six months.

35:58.857 --> 36:00.459
That's how
I can be helpful.

36:00.492 --> 36:02.394
I won't keep attendings away
from their own services,

36:02.428 --> 36:04.062
and Schmitt won't be
run into the ground.

36:04.095 --> 36:06.298
Let me work for you.
I'll teach labs,

36:06.332 --> 36:08.900
skills, sutures, anything.
I'm your guy to teach.

36:08.934 --> 36:10.836

Please, save me.

36:19.611 --> 36:22.013
Okay?

36:22.047 --> 36:24.583
Oh. Sure.
Okay. Thank you.

36:24.616 --> 36:25.851
Thank you for your time.

36:25.884 --> 36:27.219
Thank you. Yeah.

36:29.521 --> 36:31.690
If you disagree with
any of the changes, let me know.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.759
Nick. Nick!

36:33.792 --> 36:36.061
Look, I don't have time for all
this back and forth, Meredith.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.863
And based on the way
people just walk on in here,

36:37.896 --> 36:38.897
neither do you.

36:38.930 --> 36:40.666
Good night.

36:40.699 --> 36:42.234
I went numb.

36:42.268 --> 36:44.836
The program shut down,
and we lost a patient.

36:44.870 --> 36:47.273
And you didn't have my back.

36:47.306 --> 36:50.175
You know how many people
I've lost in my life.

36:50.208 --> 36:51.677
And when I watched you
walk away,

36:51.710 --> 36:55.447
and I thought I lost you,
then I went numb.

36:55.481 --> 36:58.784
That's why I didn't call you
for six months.

36:58.817 --> 37:01.287
An then when I saw you
in the surgical corridor, I...

37:05.624 --> 37:08.594
I could feel again.

37:08.627 --> 37:11.730
I know I'm still
in love with you.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.099
I know my life is crazy.

37:14.132 --> 37:15.734
And I know
I can't stop people

37:15.767 --> 37:18.236
from coming in the door
every five minutes

37:18.270 --> 37:21.106

absolutely everything I do.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.978

that I love you.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.114
So if that's
what you need to hear,

37:29.147 --> 37:32.150
I'll say it, as many times
as you need to hear it.

37:36.322 --> 37:39.057
Can I take you to dinner?

37:39.090 --> 37:41.293

to dinner.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.594
