38:22.764 --> 38:25.064
Life is unpredictable.

38:25.066 --> 38:27.066
Yeah. I'll say.

38:27.936 --> 38:29.568
So are you ready to come inside?

38:29.570 --> 38:32.305
Are we really gonna do this, Maura?

38:32.307 --> 38:35.641
It's been a long time. I
don't think we have a choice.

38:35.643 --> 38:37.643
[Laughs]

38:37.645 --> 38:40.079
All right.

38:40.081 --> 38:42.181
- Hi.
- Hi!

38:42.183 --> 38:45.318
- Hey!
- The happy couple!

38:45.320 --> 38:46.953
[Laughter]

38:46.955 --> 38:49.021
Oh, gosh! Look at this cake!

38:49.023 --> 38:51.023
Jane: I know. Ma went all out.

38:51.025 --> 38:52.358
Thank you.

38:52.360 --> 38:53.225
Oh, sure.

38:53.227 --> 38:54.260
So what do we do now?

38:54.262 --> 38:55.861
Well, we can't have cake

38:55.863 --> 38:58.531
until you sign the divorce papers,
and... and I want cake.

38:58.533 --> 38:59.665
- Yeah.
- Cake.

38:59.667 --> 39:01.667
All: Cake, cake, cake, cake, cake, cake!

39:01.669 --> 39:03.002
Sign 'em, Maura. Ladies first.

39:03.004 --> 39:05.438
[Laughs] Okay.

39:05.440 --> 39:06.772
Frankie: All right.

39:06.774 --> 39:09.508
And by the powers not vested in me,

39:09.510 --> 39:11.644
I pronounce you happily divorced.

39:11.646 --> 39:14.347
[All cheering]

39:14.349 --> 39:16.916
Who knew a divorce
party could be so much fun?

39:16.918 --> 39:17.984
[Laughs]

39:17.986 --> 39:19.919
Let's never have one, okay?

39:19.921 --> 39:21.287
Okay.

39:21.289 --> 39:23.289
Mmm. Ooh.

39:23.291 --> 39:25.424
All right, you have to tell
us all about Maura's wild years.

39:25.426 --> 39:26.726
- Come on.
- Ooh.

39:26.728 --> 39:28.961
Did she ever tell you about
the time she tried out

39:28.963 --> 39:30.763
to be a professional female wrestler?

39:30.765 --> 39:31.697
You're kidding me.

39:31.699 --> 39:33.232
WWF was in town.

39:33.234 --> 39:36.268
It was her opportunity to
protest gender inequality

39:36.270 --> 39:37.636
in popular culture.

39:37.638 --> 39:38.771
I have to take notes.

39:38.773 --> 39:40.606
No, seriously. She came up with a name.

39:40.608 --> 39:41.607
Oh?

39:41.609 --> 39:43.275
Maura the Mauler. She had a costume.

39:43.277 --> 39:45.511
What?!

39:45.513 --> 39:47.513
You're so right.

39:47.515 --> 39:50.116
This is the best way to
celebrate a divorce.

39:50.118 --> 39:52.551
Well, you know, I
figure a divorce should be

39:52.553 --> 39:54.420
as much fun as the wedding.

39:54.422 --> 39:55.421
Thank you for throwing the party.

39:55.423 --> 39:56.689
Yeah, sure.

39:56.691 --> 40:00.760
It's not every day that your
best friend gets divorced.

40:00.762 --> 40:03.829
[Sighs] Um...

40:03.831 --> 40:06.065
You've decided to
take the job, haven't you?

40:07.068 --> 40:09.502
Yes, I have.

40:09.504 --> 40:11.303
I think it's the right thing to do.

40:11.305 --> 40:13.873
I'm proud of you.

40:13.875 --> 40:15.374
Really?

40:15.376 --> 40:17.176
Yeah, I know change is hard.

40:17.178 --> 40:19.845
And it's scary to face the unknown,

40:19.847 --> 40:22.782
but we have more to do in our lives.

40:23.584 --> 40:26.285
Yeah.

40:26.287 --> 40:28.487
Thanks for supporting me.

40:28.489 --> 40:31.424
That's what best friends do.

40:31.426 --> 40:33.059
Here's to change.

40:33.061 --> 40:34.827
To change.

40:34.829 --> 40:36.829
And maybe collared shirts.

40:36.831 --> 40:38.164
No! No, God, no!

40:38.166 --> 40:40.433
That is never gonna happen
...not even at the Bureau.

40:40.435 --> 40:42.134
Oh, but here's some good news.

40:42.136 --> 40:45.504
Uh, the employee discount at
the FBI in the gift shop...

40:45.506 --> 40:46.639
25% off.

40:46.641 --> 40:47.673
[Gasps]

40:47.675 --> 40:48.707
[Laughs]

40:48.709 --> 40:50.443
You know I can't resist a sale.

40:50.445 --> 40:51.251
Mm-hmm.
