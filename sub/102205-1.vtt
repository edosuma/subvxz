17:51.269 --> 17:54.186
(foreboding music)

18:01.448 --> 18:03.367
- Who's there?

18:03.367 --> 18:05.950
(somber music)

18:21.605 --> 18:24.150
- Look, I didn't see nothing.

18:24.150 --> 18:24.983
All I know

18:24.983 --> 18:26.330
is they started shooting.

18:26.330 --> 18:28.160
He run out into the road.

18:29.605 --> 18:32.188
(somber music)

18:36.128 --> 18:37.393
- I'm sorry about your boy.

18:44.880 --> 18:47.008
Let me go see if I can figure this out.

18:47.008 --> 18:49.591
(somber music)

18:53.940 --> 18:55.760
- You had one job.

18:55.760 --> 18:56.873
- I tried to sir.

18:58.160 --> 18:59.423
I swear to God almighty.

19:00.967 --> 19:03.550
(somber music)

19:13.930 --> 19:15.872
- You couldn't protect him,

19:15.872 --> 19:18.749
how are you gonna protect yourself?

19:18.749 --> 19:21.332
(somber music)

19:33.470 --> 19:36.387
- Well, that oughta do you for now.

19:39.450 --> 19:41.030
- What I tell you about that nigger?

19:41.030 --> 19:42.193
Now look what happened.

19:46.960 --> 19:49.470
- What I tell you about
waiting on the law?

19:49.470 --> 19:52.669
- Looks like you're the one waiting now.

19:52.669 --> 19:54.580
You gonna go get him or what?

19:54.580 --> 19:58.352
- What was holding you back
from getting him last night

19:58.352 --> 20:00.570
while they were still here?

20:00.570 --> 20:03.193
- We had wounded to tend to.

20:04.910 --> 20:06.260
- We got us a prisoner too.

20:10.360 --> 20:11.950
She cut me with this,

20:11.950 --> 20:13.883
about took off my goddamn head.

20:20.860 --> 20:24.450
- I suspect you asked her
where he might could be?

20:24.450 --> 20:25.300
- More than once.

20:29.260 --> 20:30.263
- He ain't gone far.

20:45.412 --> 20:49.245
- I expect we should get
her down to the jail.

20:50.890 --> 20:52.840
- They say Red and the Kid left together,

20:52.840 --> 20:54.223
or they go separate ways.

20:56.420 --> 20:57.483
- That's the story.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.560
- I guess I'd better go saddle up,

21:02.560 --> 21:04.040
try to get on the trail

21:04.040 --> 21:04.873
before they do.

21:07.340 --> 21:08.840
- There's going to be a posse.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.173
No stopping it.

21:13.750 --> 21:15.100
- Unless we get them first.

Come on and go to town with me.

You ain't guilty of nothing yet.

22:57.396 --> 22:59.003
Work this out, Red,

just me and you.

23:05.174 --> 23:07.924
(dramatic music)

23:14.480 --> 23:15.692
Red!

23:15.692 --> 23:17.687
They'll get you soon enough.

23:41.468 --> 23:44.135
(group chatter)

23:45.431 --> 23:47.220
- I ain't waiting on that
damn sheriff, no sir.

23:47.220 --> 23:48.892
- What the hell are they waiting on?

23:48.892 --> 23:50.120
Let's get on with it.

23:50.120 --> 23:51.612
- I heard that nigger robbed over $1,000!

23:51.612 --> 23:54.279
(group chatter)

23:55.260 --> 23:56.567
- He's got himself a pack.

23:56.567 --> 23:57.780
And every one of them big bad bull's

23:57.780 --> 23:58.997
got killing on their mind.

23:58.997 --> 24:00.972
- It ain't right, y'all.

24:00.972 --> 24:04.472
(dramatic drumming music)

24:09.730 --> 24:11.320
- If you told me where he was,

24:11.320 --> 24:13.527
it would save a whole lot of heartache.

24:20.210 --> 24:21.403
I might could save him.

24:22.730 --> 24:23.623
They find him,

24:24.490 --> 24:26.483
they will string him up on the spot.

24:31.550 --> 24:32.953
- They'd have done that anyhow.

24:34.179 --> 24:36.846
(group chatter)

24:55.190 --> 24:56.023
- Seen him.

24:56.023 --> 24:57.824
South to Crosby.

24:57.824 --> 25:00.342
(group chatter)

25:00.342 --> 25:01.175
- [Sheriff] What else did you see?

25:01.175 --> 25:02.902
- Found blood.

25:02.902 --> 25:03.905
He's wounded too.

25:03.905 --> 25:04.738
(group chatter)

25:04.738 --> 25:05.833
- Now look here, men,

25:05.833 --> 25:08.750
make sure we do this the right way.

25:10.669 --> 25:11.752
Listen to me.

25:12.652 --> 25:14.652
We gotta follow the law!

25:21.760 --> 25:22.950
- I'd better go with 'em,

25:22.950 --> 25:24.250
make sure it's done right.

25:26.150 --> 25:27.600
- I'd go with you if I could.

25:28.940 --> 25:29.990
- You're needed here.

25:32.711 --> 25:34.810
- You be looking after yourself, son.

25:34.810 --> 25:35.643
- Yes, sir.

25:49.532 --> 25:52.282
(dramatic music)

28:00.791 --> 28:02.871
- Best to catch him tomorrow.

28:02.871 --> 28:06.780
- He's going to cry for
his mama when we do,

28:06.780 --> 28:07.893
that's for sure.

28:09.815 --> 28:12.070
- Best to be worth it.

28:12.070 --> 28:13.823
Catch a death out here myself.

28:15.031 --> 28:19.320
- You hear about that
nigger in Jeff Davis County?

28:19.320 --> 28:20.750
Killed himself, his deputy,

28:20.750 --> 28:23.250
didn't have the sense to shoot him first.

28:23.250 --> 28:25.300
Nigger ran nearly 60 miles

28:25.300 --> 28:26.350
before we caught him.

28:27.389 --> 28:28.739
He ain't gonna run no more.

28:35.400 --> 28:36.720
Come warm yourself up.

28:36.720 --> 28:37.770
- Don't mind if I do.

28:38.720 --> 28:40.135
- [Graham] Where are you from?

28:40.135 --> 28:42.171
- Rosetta.

28:42.171 --> 28:44.091
Them's from Perrytown.

28:44.091 --> 28:47.091
(soft bluesy music)

29:26.360 --> 29:27.193
- See that?

29:30.070 --> 29:31.993
- He sure is in a hurry.

29:33.160 --> 29:35.510
- Might be one of them
niggers they be chasing.

29:36.490 --> 29:37.323
- Which one?

29:37.323 --> 29:39.196
- You know them outlaws.

29:39.196 --> 29:41.170
- Might be.

29:41.170 --> 29:42.787
- Reckon we oughta go after him?

29:52.537 --> 29:54.609
(gun shot fires)

29:54.609 --> 29:57.609
(soft bluesy music)

30:35.991 --> 30:38.658
(water flowing)

31:14.975 --> 31:17.808
(bridge clanking)

31:47.904 --> 31:50.571
(water flowing)

31:57.507 --> 32:00.060
- I think I got a pretty good shot on him.

32:00.060 --> 32:01.303
- He was heading west.

32:03.670 --> 32:05.320
- Natchez way?

32:05.320 --> 32:06.552
- [Man] To the river maybe.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.740
- When did this happen?

32:08.740 --> 32:12.083
- Oh, five hours or so.

32:13.380 --> 32:14.213
- [Old Man] Thank you kindly.

32:14.213 --> 32:15.110
Let's ride, posse.

32:18.470 --> 32:20.227
- [Man] Mind I we come along?

32:21.374 --> 32:24.624
- [Old Man] If you ain't doing nothing.

32:32.190 --> 32:33.523
- He ain't here.

32:46.146 --> 32:48.146
- [Woman] Come on, boys.

32:52.510 --> 32:55.510
(suspenseful music)

33:00.408 --> 33:01.241
- Mama.

33:02.110 --> 33:05.110
(suspenseful music)

33:08.746 --> 33:10.080
- My boy Luke saw him
hiding in the tunnels

33:10.080 --> 33:11.550
and he ran off.

33:11.550 --> 33:13.163
I'm not sure which way he went.

33:15.251 --> 33:16.851
- [Man] I'll take five and go this way,

33:16.851 --> 33:18.072
and you take the rest that way.

33:18.072 --> 33:19.448
- I wanna go.

33:19.448 --> 33:20.281
I wanna catch him, please.

33:20.281 --> 33:21.907
I wanna catch him.

33:21.907 --> 33:23.646
- Y'all come with me.

33:23.646 --> 33:25.840
Ma'am, you need to get them youngins home.

33:25.840 --> 33:27.053
You go with her.

33:29.027 --> 33:31.944
(foreboding music)

33:52.230 --> 33:53.463
- Is he one of ours?

33:56.559 --> 33:58.381
Son of a bitch.

33:58.381 --> 34:01.298
(foreboding music)

34:09.360 --> 34:10.193
- [Man] Have you seen
anybody come through here?

34:10.193 --> 34:11.026
- [Maid] No sir.

34:11.026 --> 34:11.859
- [Man] Are you sure?

34:11.859 --> 34:13.384
- [Maid] Yes, sir.

34:13.384 --> 34:14.217
- [Man] You don't know this
man that we're looking for?

34:14.217 --> 34:15.215
- [Maid] No sir.

34:15.215 --> 34:16.048
- [Man] I believe you do.

34:16.048 --> 34:16.881
I believe you're lying to me.

34:16.881 --> 34:17.714
- No sir.

34:17.714 --> 34:18.547
- I think you are.

34:18.547 --> 34:19.459
I think you're trying to protect him.

34:19.459 --> 34:20.292
- [Maid] No sir, I don't.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.330
- That ain't possible.

34:21.330 --> 34:24.973
He was seen down by Forest
plantation noontime.

34:26.070 --> 34:29.400
- He came through my
property right yonder.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.173
- Let's go.

34:32.440 --> 34:35.326
- Nigger can't be in two
places at the same time.

34:35.326 --> 34:36.260
(man muttering)

34:36.260 --> 34:37.440
- Was he tall or short?

34:37.440 --> 34:38.981
- Hell, I don't know.

34:38.981 --> 34:41.022
You're looking for a nigger, ain't you?

34:41.022 --> 34:43.703
- Mister, there's two we're looking for.

34:44.581 --> 34:46.142

37:17.974 --> 37:18.923
We'll see you again.

37:56.732 --> 38:00.065
(Red and Kid chuckling)

38:02.134 --> 38:04.214
Oh, come on now Red.

38:04.214 --> 38:05.070
You gonna get dirt on my new suit.

38:05.070 --> 38:06.100
Come on, now.

38:08.676 --> 38:11.077
- Good to see you, man.

38:11.077 --> 38:12.627
- Good to see you too, brother.

38:14.598 --> 38:15.850
- [Red] Where you been, man?

38:15.850 --> 38:17.550
- [Kid] On the run, just like you.

38:21.610 --> 38:23.750
- [Red] So this is where you been?

38:23.750 --> 38:25.300
- [Kid] Since last night, yeah.

38:26.820 --> 38:27.830
Having a roof over your head

38:27.830 --> 38:29.480
sure is better than nothing, huh?

38:31.077 --> 38:32.393
- [Red] Yeah.

38:33.956 --> 38:35.320
You sure we're safe here?

38:35.320 --> 38:36.873
- Woman lives upstairs says so.

38:38.619 --> 38:40.440
I might go see her in a while.

38:40.440 --> 38:42.695
Already went walking with her last night.

38:42.695 --> 38:45.278
(Kid chuckles)

38:46.140 --> 38:47.463
- Even after all this,

38:48.320 --> 38:49.773
still the same old Kid.

38:52.200 --> 38:53.333
- Rest those dogs.

39:03.560 --> 39:04.393
- Hey,

39:05.440 --> 39:06.840
how did you get ahead of me?

39:08.120 --> 39:09.970
I've been running day in and day out.

39:12.219 --> 39:14.303
- I hitched a ride.

39:16.459 --> 39:18.774
(Red scoffs)

39:18.774 --> 39:19.977
- You mean you stole one?

39:20.980 --> 39:22.399
- Musters college, he's still gonna eat--

39:22.399 --> 39:25.066
(siren blaring)

39:27.530 --> 39:28.730
- We can't be here long,

39:30.190 --> 39:31.033
either of us.

39:32.170 --> 39:34.513
- Oh, I was planning on getting
out before the sun wakes up.

39:35.460 --> 39:36.891
- [Red] Where?

39:36.891 --> 39:37.724
- Across the river.

39:40.300 --> 39:42.350
Figure the days might be kinder out west.

39:45.334 --> 39:50.334
- I don't think there's a kind
of place out there anywhere,

39:50.390 --> 39:51.473
for us, that is.

39:54.170 --> 39:56.620
- Well, maybe it's time
for the Oklahoma Kid

39:56.620 --> 39:57.920
to become an Oklahoma man.

40:01.851 --> 40:02.913
Why don't you come with me?

40:09.808 --> 40:11.463
- I ain't going.

40:13.564 --> 40:17.083
This is much my state as it is theirs.

40:20.910 --> 40:23.980
Anyhow, how you planning on
getting across that bridge

40:23.980 --> 40:25.080
without them catching?

40:28.352 --> 40:29.933
- I ain't planning on going that way.

40:36.870 --> 40:39.453
(bluesy music)

40:41.010 --> 40:43.290
- [Red] Might as well be dead.

40:43.290 --> 40:44.403
Gulf of Mexico.

40:47.190 --> 40:49.873
- [Kid] It's another side to everything.

40:49.873 --> 40:51.373
- I've been meaning to ask ya,

40:53.254 --> 40:56.192
they've been chasing us hard

40:56.192 --> 40:58.210
and all over

40:59.830 --> 41:00.880
robbing a few stores?

41:05.720 --> 41:07.170
- I probably killed that boy.

41:14.940 --> 41:15.790
- You listen Kid,

41:17.280 --> 41:18.530
it was either you or him.

41:20.850 --> 41:23.400
It ain't like they need a
reason to kill us anyway.

41:25.610 --> 41:26.443
Huh?

41:29.880 --> 41:31.140
- Sure don't, Red.

41:34.971 --> 41:36.891
They sure don't.

41:36.891 --> 41:39.474
(bluesy music)

41:43.940 --> 41:46.710
Hey, why don't you take these?

41:46.710 --> 41:47.923
I don't need 'em in there.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.750
- You will once you get over there.

41:53.840 --> 41:54.763
Besides,

41:56.390 --> 41:57.677
they, won't fit no how.

41:59.014 --> 42:01.597
(Red chuckles)

42:03.254 --> 42:05.671
- What you saying there, Red?

42:12.580 --> 42:14.530
- Take care of yourself out there, Kid.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.143
- You too, brother.

43:04.208 --> 43:06.053
You brought him this far.

We can take him from here.

46:00.090 --> 46:01.547
- [Man] He swam the Sip?

46:01.547 --> 46:03.354
- [Man] No living man ever did.

46:03.354 --> 46:05.695
- [Man] That's just conjecture,

46:05.695 --> 46:08.191
pure speculation.

46:08.191 --> 46:10.280
- [Man] The black bugger's probably back

46:11.135 --> 46:11.968
sitting on his front porch

46:11.968 --> 46:13.310
chewing on the plug,

46:13.310 --> 46:16.370
while we got more than a
hundred men out looking.

46:16.370 --> 46:17.203
- 300.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.573
Apparently you hadn't read
this morning's edition.

46:28.050 --> 46:30.230
- He's brought in the guard?

46:30.230 --> 46:31.130
- Let me see that.

46:33.010 --> 46:34.493
All this fuss over one man.

46:35.730 --> 46:38.130
- New governor's trying
to prove something.

46:38.130 --> 46:41.104
- Well, we just can't have
that kind running loose.

46:41.104 --> 46:44.185
- Ain't no telling what
a man like that would do.

46:44.185 --> 46:46.185
- Yeah, he can't be far.

46:47.292 --> 46:49.683
- Yeah, and he can't run forever.

46:51.266 --> 46:54.016
(train rumbling)

47:12.630 --> 47:13.628
- [Man] You see anything up there?

47:13.628 --> 47:14.988
- No, he ain't up here.

47:14.988 --> 47:16.150
- [Man] I'll meet you at (mumbles).

47:16.150 --> 47:17.650
- [Man] All right.

47:18.940 --> 47:20.985
- Who the hell knows where we
gonna find that nigger now.

47:20.985 --> 47:24.860
- Well, we've got a
whole platoon of troops

47:24.860 --> 47:26.332
just sitting on their asses right now.

47:26.332 --> 47:28.572
- Good evening.

47:28.572 --> 47:31.570
Agent Ballard, Jackson office.

47:31.570 --> 47:32.588
- Railroad agent?

47:32.588 --> 47:33.493
- Federal.

47:36.020 --> 47:37.734
- [Officer] Talking about the FBI?

47:37.734 --> 47:39.500
- [Ballard] We got word

47:39.500 --> 47:41.010
he might be headed northeast from here

47:41.010 --> 47:42.260
towards Jefferson County.

47:43.110 --> 47:45.633
- We're in Jefferson
County right now, agent.

47:45.633 --> 47:47.629
- Yeah?

47:47.629 --> 47:50.492
Well, now you must be the
law around here, yeah?

47:50.492 --> 47:51.325
- Yeah.

47:52.774 --> 47:55.774
(crickets chirping)

49:57.414 --> 49:58.247
- Sidney!

50:22.972 --> 50:23.974
- What's this all about?

50:23.974 --> 50:25.557
What you done here?

50:29.400 --> 50:30.520
- [Man] Sidney.

50:30.520 --> 50:31.903
We gotta stop the fire.

50:35.793 --> 50:36.626
- Mama!

50:36.626 --> 50:41.626
(somber music)
(woman harmonizing)

51:41.121 --> 51:43.871
(glass breaking)

52:03.630 --> 52:04.463
- Red?

52:06.172 --> 52:07.840
Hold, hold.

52:07.840 --> 52:09.340
You don't gots to do that now.

52:10.180 --> 52:11.233
- I don't know you.

52:12.660 --> 52:13.803
- But I know you.

52:14.860 --> 52:16.370
I seen't you the other night

52:16.370 --> 52:17.320
at the Rhythm Club,

52:18.300 --> 52:19.317
so I know you.

52:21.927 --> 52:25.373
And so does every man south of Vicksburg.

52:26.609 --> 52:29.192
(bluesy music)

52:32.250 --> 52:33.350
So where's you headed?

52:34.972 --> 52:36.683
- Not sure yet.

52:38.060 --> 52:39.310
Come in through Stoneham.

52:40.892 --> 52:43.745
- Yeah, I knows it.

52:43.745 --> 52:47.533
Briggler's barn burned to the ground.

52:49.186 --> 52:51.533
The gin and the dairy too.

52:53.329 --> 52:55.912
(bluesy music)

52:56.850 --> 52:57.683
Red,

52:59.880 --> 53:02.790
they ain't speculating
about laying that on you?

53:02.790 --> 53:03.980
People's gonna help.

53:05.886 --> 53:08.550
Don't you know that?

53:13.527 --> 53:15.503
I see you need some shoes.

53:23.476 --> 53:26.226
(Red whimpering)

53:31.609 --> 53:34.192
(bluesy music)

53:43.290 --> 53:44.833
- I suppose there's a lot
of things in this world

53:44.833 --> 53:46.277
that don't wear 'em.

53:49.311 --> 53:52.540
(bluesy music)

53:52.540 --> 53:54.093
- Most of God's creatures.

53:56.352 --> 53:58.935
(bluesy music)

54:06.996 --> 54:09.496
(phone rings)

54:25.874 --> 54:27.170
- Yeah?

54:27.170 --> 54:28.600
- [Woman] Sheriff Johnson.

54:28.600 --> 54:30.692
I have the governor on the line for you.

54:30.692 --> 54:32.123
- Oh, okay.

54:36.050 --> 54:37.100
- [Governor] Sheriff?

54:37.100 --> 54:38.223
- Yes. Mr. Governor.

54:40.290 --> 54:41.123
- [Governor] I've been told

54:41.123 --> 54:42.783
he's moved into your jurisdiction.

54:44.777 --> 54:47.510
- Yes, Mr. Governor,

54:47.510 --> 54:48.510
that's what we hear.

54:50.280 --> 54:51.113
- [Governor] Well, sheriff,

54:51.113 --> 54:52.960
I don't know what the hell are you doing,

54:52.960 --> 54:54.510
but you oughta be out chasing him

54:54.510 --> 54:56.473
rather than talking on the telephone.

54:58.820 --> 55:02.983
- I understand Mr. Governor,

55:04.340 --> 55:07.003
but I got my best deputy tracking them.

55:08.319 --> 55:11.297
We got volunteers from every community

55:11.297 --> 55:13.460
keeping an eye out for them.

55:15.330 --> 55:16.190
We got hounds--

55:16.190 --> 55:17.697
- [Governor] I don't care what you got.

55:17.697 --> 55:19.700
This is embarrassing.

55:19.700 --> 55:22.763
He had better not make it
out of Jefferson County.

55:45.190 --> 55:47.140
- How do you know he's coming this way?

55:48.530 --> 55:49.880
- How you think I knows it?

55:51.120 --> 55:52.083
Cause I feels it.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.333
Just the other day,

55:55.250 --> 55:56.557
they almost caught him.

55:58.516 --> 56:03.516
(cows mooing)
(drumming music)

56:17.070 --> 56:18.775
- But they didn't, right?

56:18.775 --> 56:20.873
- [Girl] Can't catch Red.

56:20.873 --> 56:23.873
- Yeah, that deputy sure came close.

56:26.095 --> 56:28.845
(drumming music)

56:32.309 --> 56:33.313
- Red shot him?

56:33.313 --> 56:34.813
- Sure enough did.

56:35.876 --> 56:37.716
Knocked that hat clean off his head.

56:37.716 --> 56:40.466
(gun shot fires)

56:41.775 --> 56:45.950
(cows mooing)
(drumming music)

56:45.950 --> 56:46.990
- With a pistol?

56:46.990 --> 56:48.460
- No, it was a shotgun.

56:50.355 --> 56:51.847
(gun shot fires)

56:51.847 --> 56:55.420
(drumming music)

56:55.420 --> 56:57.420
- Why we putting rabbits up in the tree?

56:58.308 --> 57:00.642
- Y'all wanna help Red, don't you?

57:00.642 --> 57:02.746
Y'all heard grandmamma.

57:02.746 --> 57:03.579
He coming.

57:04.644 --> 57:07.394
(drumming music)

57:28.788 --> 57:31.205
(soft music)

57:48.164 --> 57:48.997
- Red.

57:52.586 --> 57:53.988
Red.

57:53.988 --> 57:56.405
(soft music)

58:01.967 --> 58:02.800
Red.

58:03.920 --> 58:05.604
(soft music)

58:05.604 --> 58:07.187
Where are you, Red?

58:08.964 --> 58:10.244
Where are you?

58:10.244 --> 58:12.661
(soft music)

58:22.060 --> 58:23.380
Come find me, Red.

58:26.660 --> 58:27.493
Red.

58:30.386 --> 58:31.553
Where are you?

58:33.540 --> 58:36.330
Gotta make it to the other side, Red.

58:37.348 --> 58:39.247
Gotta make it with all our pride,

58:39.247 --> 58:41.497
make it with all our pride.

58:42.826 --> 58:45.300
Got to make it to the
other side, the other side.

58:45.300 --> 58:48.261
Gotta make it with all our pride.

58:48.261 --> 58:49.617
(soft music)

58:49.617 --> 58:52.418
Gotta make it to the other side, Red.

58:52.418 --> 58:55.117
Gotta make it with all our pride.

58:55.117 --> 58:57.534
(soft music)

59:08.135 --> 59:09.385
Come home, Red.

59:35.911 --> 59:39.078
(car engine rumbling)

1:00:19.715 --> 1:00:20.548
- Coochie.

1:00:22.715 --> 1:00:23.798
You in there?

1:00:24.695 --> 1:00:27.862
(car engine rumbling)

1:00:50.690 --> 1:00:52.823
This has gotten way out of hand, Coochie.

1:00:54.260 --> 1:00:56.403
Governor's up my ass.

1:00:57.720 --> 1:00:59.230
Would you believe he's made it now

1:00:59.230 --> 1:01:00.823
as far as Claiborne County?

1:01:03.240 --> 1:01:04.483
Means he's coming here.

1:01:12.260 --> 1:01:14.593
Goddamn Coochie, say something.

1:01:17.240 --> 1:01:18.693
You know why I came here?

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:22.370
You're the best tracker in these parts.

1:01:24.381 --> 1:01:26.933
Maybe in the whole southeast.

1:01:30.760 --> 1:01:32.723
- I don't hunt just anybody,

1:01:35.720 --> 1:01:37.803
as I'm sure you are aware of.

1:01:42.020 --> 1:01:43.673
What did this man do?

1:01:48.300 --> 1:01:49.810
- Well,

1:01:49.810 --> 1:01:51.143
he's a thief for one.

1:01:53.180 --> 1:01:54.880
At least that's what they tell me.

1:01:56.740 --> 1:01:57.943
I know he's a killer.

1:01:58.970 --> 1:02:01.393
He shot a boy dead,

1:02:02.900 --> 1:02:04.700
probably not more than 15 years old.

1:02:11.840 --> 1:02:12.673
Coochie,

1:02:14.861 --> 1:02:17.540
if we don't stop him,

1:02:17.540 --> 1:02:19.890
who knows how many more
are gonna act like him.

1:02:22.160 --> 1:02:23.378
Once they get the notion,

1:02:23.378 --> 1:02:25.763
there'll be a ruckus.

1:02:29.260 --> 1:02:30.223
- If I go,

1:02:33.210 --> 1:02:36.963
I don't want it to be the
part of no fucking posse.

1:02:39.341 --> 1:02:41.390
Do you understand?

1:02:42.642 --> 1:02:45.725
(soft country music)

1:05:16.118 --> 1:05:18.812
(dog barking)

1:05:18.812 --> 1:05:21.895
(soft country music)

1:05:24.408 --> 1:05:25.741
- How you doing?

1:05:37.050 --> 1:05:39.467
(soft music)

1:06:27.851 --> 1:06:28.684
- What have I been telling you

1:06:28.684 --> 1:06:29.748
about leaving the house?

1:06:29.748 --> 1:06:30.581
Come on.

1:06:33.761 --> 1:06:35.670
- We got men lining the trace.

1:06:35.670 --> 1:06:36.503
He's not going to get through there.

1:06:36.503 --> 1:06:38.650
We got more men at Paterson's,

1:06:38.650 --> 1:06:39.728
from the east to the west

1:06:39.728 --> 1:06:43.280
in case he decides to
turn back to the south.

1:06:43.280 --> 1:06:45.725
The guard has run the
interference in the northeast,

1:06:45.725 --> 1:06:48.230
just in case this nigger's dumb enough

1:06:48.230 --> 1:06:50.242
to head straight to Jackson.

1:06:50.242 --> 1:06:53.680
(Graham chuckles)

1:06:53.680 --> 1:06:54.530
They leave us alone,

1:06:54.530 --> 1:06:56.073
we gonna catch this coon.

1:06:57.260 --> 1:06:58.093
At any rate,

1:06:58.960 --> 1:07:01.728
he's not getting out of Claiborne County.

1:07:01.728 --> 1:07:04.210
(crickets chirping)

1:07:04.210 --> 1:07:06.040
- I wouldn't be so sure.

1:07:06.040 --> 1:07:08.070
- Oh, he better not.

1:07:08.070 --> 1:07:10.848
I ain't seen my wife in three weeks.

1:07:10.848 --> 1:07:13.080
I'm about tired of this business.

1:07:13.080 --> 1:07:14.930
- Thought that would be a good thing.

1:07:18.300 --> 1:07:19.890
- Well, what about your man?

1:07:19.890 --> 1:07:20.723
This loner?

1:07:22.550 --> 1:07:23.383
- He's coming.

1:07:24.400 --> 1:07:25.760
(Graham chuckles)

1:07:25.760 --> 1:07:26.743
Remember y'all,

1:07:27.590 --> 1:07:31.700
this is the man who
caught Bonnie and Clyde

1:07:31.700 --> 1:07:32.963
just a few years ago.

1:07:35.510 --> 1:07:37.360
- But he's not the one that shot 'em.

1:07:52.827 --> 1:07:53.793
- You up there?

1:07:59.620 --> 1:08:02.463
(birds chirping)

1:08:02.463 --> 1:08:03.713
If you up there

1:08:06.270 --> 1:08:07.103
all I ask is

1:08:10.340 --> 1:08:11.440
you take care of Dolly

1:08:14.150 --> 1:08:15.413
cause she's a good woman.

1:08:21.020 --> 1:08:21.933
And the Kid,

1:08:24.920 --> 1:08:26.123
if he crossed the river,

1:08:28.300 --> 1:08:29.803
keep the patrol off him.

1:08:36.210 --> 1:08:38.910
I got a feeling it's not
going to be much more longer.

1:08:41.870 --> 1:08:43.113
And if you up there,

1:08:52.970 --> 1:08:54.260
I'll be seeing you soon.

1:09:27.899 --> 1:09:30.566
(water flowing)

1:11:03.054 --> 1:11:04.276
(gun shot fires)

1:11:04.276 --> 1:11:06.859
(somber music)

1:11:36.679 --> 1:11:39.262
(Red coughing)

1:11:43.615 --> 1:11:46.198
(somber music)

1:12:04.150 --> 1:12:05.313
- Give up, Red.

1:12:08.340 --> 1:12:09.173
It's over.

1:12:11.875 --> 1:12:13.725
You ain't gonna go nowhere like that.

1:12:18.138 --> 1:12:19.305
- I ain't ever

1:12:20.436 --> 1:12:21.603
going give up.

1:12:27.450 --> 1:12:28.393
- You got a gun?

1:12:29.850 --> 1:12:31.720
They told me you were armed.

1:12:33.240 --> 1:12:34.290
- I ain't got no gun.

1:12:36.810 --> 1:12:37.643
- Shit.

1:12:39.935 --> 1:12:42.518
(somber music)

1:12:49.150 --> 1:12:51.333
Posse is coming to get you.

1:12:57.375 --> 1:12:59.208
- I won't be the last.

1:13:03.578 --> 1:13:06.245
There'll be more coming like me.

1:13:07.514 --> 1:13:10.097
(somber music)

1:13:32.196 --> 1:13:33.594
- Well?

1:13:33.594 --> 1:13:36.314
- He's hold up in one of them
bushes on the other side.

1:13:36.314 --> 1:13:38.207
- Well you just left him there

1:13:38.207 --> 1:13:40.058
so he could get away?

1:13:40.058 --> 1:13:41.178
- I don't my job.

1:13:41.178 --> 1:13:43.876
He ain't going nowhere.

1:13:43.876 --> 1:13:46.459
(somber music)

1:13:51.258 --> 1:13:53.091
- Massa, much obliged.

1:13:57.370 --> 1:13:59.391
- I just pulled the trigger.

1:13:59.391 --> 1:14:01.974
(somber music)

1:14:18.010 --> 1:14:20.593
(guns cocking)

1:15:01.210 --> 1:15:04.127
(gun shots firing)

1:15:10.271 --> 1:15:12.938
(water flowing)

1:15:24.511 --> 1:15:27.290
- [Man On Radio] It was in
the neutral Norwegian waters

1:15:27.290 --> 1:15:29.530
that Germany claimed the
right to destroy neutral ships

1:15:29.530 --> 1:15:31.194
and murder non-competent seamen,

1:15:31.194 --> 1:15:32.771
against all international law.

1:15:32.771 --> 1:15:34.874
When the allies answered force with force,

1:15:34.874 --> 1:15:37.210
once again Germany marched to aggression.

1:15:37.210 --> 1:15:40.377
(car engine rumbling)

1:16:12.954 --> 1:16:15.371
(soft music)

1:19:10.330 --> 1:19:13.080
(birds chirping)

1:19:19.810 --> 1:19:20.643
- Today,

1:19:22.010 --> 1:19:23.960
we're gonna learn about the revolution,

1:19:25.160 --> 1:19:27.000
how America got its freedom.

1:19:35.540 --> 1:19:36.563
But first,

1:19:39.830 --> 1:19:41.330
y'all wanna hear a real story,

1:19:43.194 --> 1:19:45.233
the kind they don't write about in books?

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:49.313
Well,

1:19:52.080 --> 1:19:52.913
well?

1:19:52.913 --> 1:19:53.820
- [Class] Yes sir.

1:19:53.820 --> 1:19:54.683
- [Kid] Yes sir?

1:19:55.524 --> 1:19:56.511
- [Class] Yes sir.

1:19:56.511 --> 1:19:59.243
- It's about a good friend of mine,

1:20:04.370 --> 1:20:05.423
called him Texas Red.

1:20:13.114 --> 1:20:15.354
Now he was a true rebel.

1:20:15.354 --> 1:20:17.191
- [Man] Hey, play that thing, Red.
