WEBVTT

00:31.198 --> 00:32.731
This is gonna be tough.

00:32.732 --> 00:37.636
Um... my sister
means a lot to me.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.141
I feel incredibly lucky
and blessed to have you

00:42.143 --> 00:44.777
not only as my daughter
but as my very best friend.

00:44.779 --> 00:46.445
Oh.

00:46.447 --> 00:48.614
While Devery
was growing up, many doubted

00:48.616 --> 00:50.382
that the words "Devery"
and "wedding"...

00:51.685 --> 00:54.453
...would ever be used
simultaneously.

00:56.223 --> 00:59.124
If there's one important lesson
my parents have taught me

00:59.126 --> 01:01.493
to a great life
and a happy marriage,

01:01.495 --> 01:03.762
it's to always have a drink
in your hand.

01:05.465 --> 01:08.067
And since Seth is
one of my best friends

01:08.069 --> 01:10.235
and you just embarrassed Seth,

01:10.237 --> 01:12.738
I got his back, and I'm about to
embarrass Jillian.

01:12.740 --> 01:16.375
And I saw Camille laugh,
then I knew you were the one.

01:16.377 --> 01:19.078
God bless you both.
I love you.

01:19.080 --> 01:21.080
I would like to propose a toast.

01:21.082 --> 01:23.315
- Raise your glasses.
- Cheers.

01:23.317 --> 01:24.416
Cheers.

01:24.418 --> 01:25.451
Cheers.

01:30.458 --> 01:32.224
So...

01:32.226 --> 01:35.260
here you are... getting married.

01:35.262 --> 01:36.462
Ugh.

01:38.499 --> 01:40.365
You always said
I'd be the first to go,

01:40.367 --> 01:43.669
but... I guess this makes sense.

01:43.671 --> 01:47.106
It's just like the sleepovers
we used to have.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.674
We were young...

01:48.676 --> 01:50.509
- but we were kings.
- Ben.

01:50.511 --> 01:52.778
A group of guys trying to
stay up as late as we could.

01:52.780 --> 01:55.280
Nothing could make us surrender
our freedom.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.315
- Ben.
- Yes. Alice.

01:56.317 --> 01:58.117
Sorry, but I have a question.

01:58.119 --> 02:00.119
Why is this whole thing
about sleeping children?

02:00.121 --> 02:01.787
It's an allegory.
Can you just let me finish?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.790
Oh! Okay. Well, as an allegory,
then this is amazing.

02:04.792 --> 02:06.191
You promised
you'd be supportive.

02:06.193 --> 02:07.726
I am! I just told you it's
amazing.

02:07.728 --> 02:09.495
Keep going.

02:09.497 --> 02:12.865
See, there are a couple
of phases to every sleepover.

02:12.867 --> 02:14.833
First there's the beginning
of the night,

02:14.835 --> 02:16.435
when everything's perfect

02:16.437 --> 02:18.437
and it seems like no one's
ever going to bed.

02:18.439 --> 02:21.707
Then a few guys pass out,
and everyone makes fun of them

02:21.709 --> 02:23.275
for being weak and soft.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.877
- Soft?
- Okay.

02:24.879 --> 02:29.214
But slowly, the rest pass out,
and before you know it,

02:29.216 --> 02:32.885
it's down to you
and one other person.

02:32.887 --> 02:35.687
That was always me and Matt.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.723
Brothers in arms.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.259
Well, that was fuckin' weird.

02:40.261 --> 02:41.693
All right.
The speech is good.

02:41.695 --> 02:44.663
- You're just being a dick.
- Um, I'm sorry, Ben.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.299
Do you know
what a best-man's speech is?

02:47.301 --> 02:50.903
It is one man's heartfelt truth
spoken publicly to another man

02:50.905 --> 02:52.704
who happens to be
getting married

02:52.706 --> 02:54.606
and leaving me behind forever.

02:54.608 --> 02:56.308
- Eesh.
- I'm fine.

02:56.310 --> 02:57.809
- Yeah?
- I know how that sounded.

02:57.811 --> 02:59.444
I'm fine.
I'm happy for Matt.

02:59.446 --> 03:01.446
- Clearly.
- No, I-I really am.

03:01.448 --> 03:04.183
And plus, I got someone
to look forward to.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.517
Jess Ramsey's in the house
tonight.

03:05.519 --> 03:06.785
Who?

03:06.787 --> 03:09.555
Jess Ramsey.
You know who she is.

03:09.557 --> 03:11.723
Remember she came to visit
our dorm freshman year?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.625
She almost spent the night
in my room.

03:13.627 --> 03:15.527
We did that play in high school
where we had to kiss,

03:15.529 --> 03:17.696
but then, at the after-party,
we actually kissed.

03:17.698 --> 03:19.198
I'm really sorry, Ben.

03:19.200 --> 03:20.666
I must have cleared out
the memory of her

03:20.668 --> 03:22.201
to make space
for something else.

03:22.203 --> 03:24.603
- Okay. This has been great.
- I agree.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.772
But I think it's time for you
to go back to your room.

03:26.774 --> 03:28.207
I don't like my room.

03:28.209 --> 03:29.508
I got to get
to my best-man duties.

03:29.510 --> 03:31.276
- Come on.
- Duties? What duties?

03:31.278 --> 03:33.278
Pictures, mingling.
There's a lot of mingling.

03:33.280 --> 03:35.314
- Well, I've got zero duties.
- Come on.

03:35.316 --> 03:36.648
Ben, I'm trying to help you,
okay?

03:36.650 --> 03:39.384
A wedding speech
is just making people laugh.

03:39.386 --> 03:40.886
This Ramsey girl
doesn't want to hear

03:40.888 --> 03:43.255
your weird, jealous sendoff
for Matt.

03:43.257 --> 03:44.890
I'm not jealous.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.892
You're a little jelly.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.727
You're a little jellybean.
Boop-boop-beep.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.462
Okay.
Bye, Alice.

03:50.464 --> 03:51.630
Okay. Bye.

03:51.632 --> 03:52.998
Your speech sucked.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.434
Just tell them a funny story.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.769
You'll thank me later.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.638
Fuck.

03:59.640 --> 04:03.909
But somehow Amanda still thought
Matt was attractive after that.

04:06.580 --> 04:10.449
So I'd like to raise a glass...

04:11.952 --> 04:13.885
...to Matt and Amanda.

04:13.887 --> 04:15.887
I love you guys so much.
Congratulations.

04:19.593 --> 04:21.994
- Great speech.
- Thank you. Appreciate it.

04:21.995 --> 04:24.863
Dude, get over here.
That was amazing.

04:24.865 --> 04:26.665
- Thank you so much!
- You liked it? You liked it?

04:26.667 --> 04:28.333
- Loved it.
- Oh, good.

04:28.335 --> 04:29.601
That was so good, Ben!

04:29.603 --> 04:30.936
- Thank you.
- Oh, my God. Of course.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.437
Oh, it was so good.

04:32.439 --> 04:34.406
I can't believe you told
the hot dog story.

04:34.408 --> 04:35.707
I had to tell it.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.609
I'm sure Bubbe loved
the hot dog story.

04:37.611 --> 04:39.311
- I think she kind of did.
- She had to hear it.

04:39.313 --> 04:40.879
- Maybe?
- All right.

04:40.881 --> 04:42.948
Let's get that bride and groom
out on the dance floor.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.816
We'll see you in a second.

04:44.818 --> 04:47.519
Yes. Go. Go.
Have fun.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.894
- Oh. Thanks, guy.
- Dude, great speech.

04:55.896 --> 04:58.563
Thank you.
Thank you.

04:58.565 --> 05:01.366
There he is.
Best speech of the night.

05:01.368 --> 05:02.901
Yeah.
Thanks, guys, really.

05:02.903 --> 05:04.569
Oh!

05:04.571 --> 05:06.805
Looks like it wasn't
such a bad speech after all.

05:06.807 --> 05:09.941
You changed the whole thing
'cause of me.

05:09.943 --> 05:11.610
I saved the speech.

05:11.612 --> 05:13.879
I'm a hero.
Mm.

05:13.881 --> 05:16.782
Did you get blackout
while I was up there?

05:16.784 --> 05:18.984
Did you get blackout
when <i> you</i> were up there?

05:18.986 --> 05:19.985
Fucking hell.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.087
Ben, that was so good.

05:22.089 --> 05:23.422
Oh, my God.
Thanks, Kelly.

05:23.424 --> 05:25.490
- It was so sweet.
- Really? It was?

05:25.492 --> 05:26.858
Okay.

05:36.603 --> 05:38.704
Whoo. Watch out.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.107
Alice.

05:42.109 --> 05:44.109
You're dancing all alone
over here.

05:44.111 --> 05:47.412
That's the name of my new book.

05:47.414 --> 05:48.613
Hey. Hey.
I know.

05:48.615 --> 05:50.415
I have been so completely
wrapped up

05:50.417 --> 05:52.050
in all this wedding shit.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.618
I was meaning to call you.
But I heard about you and Nate.

05:53.620 --> 05:55.487
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, fine.

05:55.489 --> 05:57.522
Let's not talk about it here.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.858
Oh, my God.
Anne! My God!

05:59.860 --> 06:01.693
Congratulations!

06:01.695 --> 06:02.961
Ben King!

06:02.963 --> 06:04.496
Jess Ramsey.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.465
I have been trying
to talk to you all night.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.733
Here's the thing.

06:07.735 --> 06:09.368
I'm the best man,
so I'm a little busy.

06:09.370 --> 06:12.137
- I have a lot going on.
- I noticed. I did.

06:12.139 --> 06:14.806
- And the speech was so good.
- Oh, my God. Thank you so much.

06:14.808 --> 06:16.942
Yeah, thanks.
Took us forever to write it.

06:16.944 --> 06:18.577
- Oh, you helped with the speech?
- Yeah.

06:18.579 --> 06:20.379
- No.
- Just the good parts, though.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.848
The pedophilia shit
was all this guy.

06:22.850 --> 06:25.751
Alice, I think there's another
dance floor in the basement.

06:25.753 --> 06:27.085
What?

06:27.087 --> 06:28.620
There's another dance floor
in the basement.

06:28.622 --> 06:29.988
You should go find it.

06:29.990 --> 06:32.124
You're a bad person.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.827
Is that your girlfriend?

06:35.829 --> 06:37.662
Her? N-No.
No. That's just Alice.

06:37.664 --> 06:39.664
She's my friend from college.

06:39.666 --> 06:41.700
We're gonna
slow things down here.

06:41.702 --> 06:43.602
Uh, shall we?

06:43.604 --> 06:45.504
Oh.
Sure.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.006
I got to warn you,
I got some pretty great moves.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.910
- How you been?
- Good. I've been good.

06:51.912 --> 06:53.812
You know, it's wedding season,
so I've been kind of --

06:53.814 --> 06:55.614
Depressed?
Totally.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.149
I was gonna say busy.

06:57.151 --> 06:59.050
Yes. Busy. Busy is the word.

06:59.052 --> 07:00.719
- Yeah.
- Ben!

07:00.721 --> 07:02.888
Ben!

07:02.890 --> 07:04.156
Oh.

07:04.158 --> 07:06.591
Looks like Alice found
a new boyfriend.

07:06.593 --> 07:09.661
Ben, come touch this kid's arm.
He's so soft.

07:09.663 --> 07:12.497
She's not usually like this.
She's going through a breakup.

07:12.499 --> 07:15.467
Is she okay?
I mean, should you go help her?

07:15.469 --> 07:17.436
Um, I-I think she's fine.

07:17.438 --> 07:18.970
Ben, come touch him!

07:18.972 --> 07:21.039
Oh, my God.
It's gorgeous out here.

07:21.041 --> 07:23.008
- Yeah.
- I thought the <i> inside</i> was great.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.976
Then I saw the outside
and I'm like,

07:24.978 --> 07:26.678
"What have I been doing inside?"

07:26.680 --> 07:27.946
It's fantastic.

07:27.948 --> 07:30.482
Are you sure
Alice is gonna be okay?

07:30.484 --> 07:32.818
Yeah, yeah. She got in
the shuttle back to the hotel.

07:32.820 --> 07:35.821
As long as she can make her way
to her room, she <i> should</i> be fine.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.823
I feel like that might be
a challenge for her.

07:37.825 --> 07:40.792
Oh, it's definitely
up for grabs. Yes.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.594
You totally could have stayed
with her.

07:42.596 --> 07:44.463
I'm just gonna get a car
and head home.

07:44.465 --> 07:46.965
No, no, no. I mean, I feel like
I so rarely get to see you.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.700
This was so great
to just catch up.

07:48.702 --> 07:50.135
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.870
Alice and I, we're not even
really that close.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.905
She just needs a shoulder
to cry on right now.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.607
And you get to be
the lucky shoulder.

07:55.609 --> 07:59.845
Yeah. I feel really, um,
blessed and honored.

07:59.847 --> 08:02.481
That's one of the many gifts
of being at the singles' table.

08:02.483 --> 08:05.484
You get all the singles
that come with it.

08:05.486 --> 08:07.252
Yeah. It sounds like you need
a new table.

08:07.254 --> 08:09.521
Well, you got to be
in a relationship for that.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.889
That can't be a problem for you.

08:10.891 --> 08:13.158
You're cute and charming
and funny.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.160
- Go on.
- Oh, stop.

08:17.164 --> 08:18.964
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, God. Oh, uh...

08:18.966 --> 08:20.565
I'm s-- Was that --

08:20.567 --> 08:21.800
Did I--
What just happened?

08:21.802 --> 08:23.034
Did I just do something
horrible?

08:23.036 --> 08:24.970
It's okay.
Just, um, I'm engaged.

08:24.972 --> 08:28.840
Jesus. I... Okay.
Was that there the whole time?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.242
- Yeah.
- Okay.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.977
I guess I got to start
looking out for those.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.611
Um, I'm so sorry.

08:33.614 --> 08:34.779
- I had no idea.
- It's okay.

08:34.780 --> 08:36.280
Uh, I should get a car, though,

08:36.283 --> 08:38.650
'cause I have this crazy day
tomorrow and I need to...

08:38.652 --> 08:40.885
Yeah. Yeah.
For sure.

08:42.990 --> 08:44.723
It was so nice seeing you,
though.

08:44.725 --> 08:47.192
Yeah! Yeah. This, um, this --
this was great.

08:47.194 --> 08:48.226
- Yep.
- Yeah.

08:48.228 --> 08:50.529
- Oh.
- Okay.

08:50.531 --> 08:52.831
Well...

08:52.833 --> 08:55.267
- Yeah. Bye, Jess. See ya.
- Bye, Ben.

09:00.974 --> 09:04.242
Oh, fuck, yeah.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.981
Oh, God. Oh.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.816
What are you doing?

09:11.818 --> 09:14.319
I'm catching up
on old episodes of "Bones."

09:14.321 --> 09:17.122
- Oh, fuck!
- How did you get in here?

09:17.124 --> 09:19.758
I stole one of your key cards
this morning.

09:19.760 --> 09:22.127
Well, that's just
a huge violation of privacy.

09:22.129 --> 09:23.695
I'm sorry!

09:23.697 --> 09:25.096
Yeah.

09:25.098 --> 09:27.332
How'd it go with blondie?

09:27.334 --> 09:28.767
I ate shit.

09:28.769 --> 09:31.970
Went in for the kiss.
Did not go well.

09:31.972 --> 09:35.206
Apparently, she's engaged,
because of course she is.

09:35.208 --> 09:37.709
Though I feel a little led on

09:37.711 --> 09:40.879
'cause she touches me a lot
for someone with a fiancé.

09:42.215 --> 09:44.249
Whoa, whoa.
Hey, hey.

09:44.251 --> 09:45.283
Hey.

09:46.753 --> 09:48.119
All right?

09:48.121 --> 09:49.321
What's wrong?

09:52.159 --> 09:53.325
Is this a Nate thing?

09:53.327 --> 09:55.760
No, it's not a Nate thing!
God!

09:55.762 --> 09:57.629
Okay, okay.

09:57.631 --> 10:01.266
It's just why does everyone
have to get married <i> now?</i>

10:01.268 --> 10:03.134
So it <i> is</i> a Nate thing.

10:03.136 --> 10:06.371
My little sister's
getting married before me.

10:06.373 --> 10:08.673
And I have four more to do
this year.

10:08.675 --> 10:09.874
Four!

10:09.876 --> 10:10.976
Yeah.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.811
I got you beat.

10:12.813 --> 10:14.613
Six.

10:15.816 --> 10:18.016
I feel like once everybody
saw 30 on the horizon,

10:18.018 --> 10:19.951
they were like, "Hey, guys.

10:19.953 --> 10:23.188
Um, you know what?
I <i> would</i> like to get engaged."

10:23.190 --> 10:25.390
- Hey, Ben?
- Here.

10:25.392 --> 10:27.759
Will you come to Jason
and Sarah's wedding with me

10:27.761 --> 10:29.127
next weekend?

10:29.129 --> 10:31.830
Alice, I'm not looking to go
to more of these.

10:31.832 --> 10:33.898
I already told them
I was bringing someone

10:33.900 --> 10:35.266
when Nate and I
were still together,

10:35.268 --> 10:38.203
and I really don't want to go
alone.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.807
There's gonna be
a lot of cute girls there.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.009
You might meet someone,

10:44.011 --> 10:46.144
someone even better
than Jen Rimbly.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.813
Jess Ramsey, but yeah,
I hear you.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.348
Please.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.283
Please, Ben.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.955
I promise you're gonna meet
someone,

10:56.957 --> 10:58.423
and if you don't,

10:58.425 --> 11:00.959
I will pay someone
to take care of you.

11:00.961 --> 11:02.394
No.
No deal.

11:02.396 --> 11:03.995
So we have a deal.

11:09.336 --> 11:10.935
Oh.

11:10.937 --> 11:13.104
Oh, shit. Um, okay.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.139
Here. Here. Here.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.210
Okay.
Okay.

11:23.350 --> 11:25.150
You're okay.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.251
Hey.

12:00.253 --> 12:02.387
Alice.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.955
Aah!

12:03.957 --> 12:06.091

No, it's Ben. You know Ben.

14:28.034 --> 14:29.200
- Hi, Ben.
- Hi, Gina.

14:29.202 --> 14:30.635
Come here, sweetie.
Come on.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.937
Sorry. We had a little
sleepover last night.

14:32.939 --> 14:34.873
Chuck!
You know what?

14:34.875 --> 14:36.241
Your dad should be down
in a minute.

14:36.243 --> 14:38.243
- He's a stranger.
- He is not a stranger.

14:38.245 --> 14:40.311
Come on, boys.
We're gonna get some naps today.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.913
Um, Ben, it was good to see you.

14:41.915 --> 14:43.481
- Good to see you, too, Gina.
- Guys, come on.

14:43.483 --> 14:45.049
Let's not hit Mommy
with the duck, okay?

14:45.051 --> 14:46.517
Dad?

14:46.519 --> 14:49.487
All right.
Get ready for the magic.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.160
Am I on the green?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.028
No.

14:57.030 --> 14:58.429
Are you lying?

14:58.431 --> 15:00.598
Yeah, Dad, I'm lying.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.668
Oh, drat.

15:04.271 --> 15:05.637
Don't say "drat."
You're not 100.

15:05.639 --> 15:08.406
I like "drat."
It feels classic.

15:08.408 --> 15:10.041
Oh.

15:10.043 --> 15:11.409
- My God.
- How's work?

15:11.411 --> 15:14.512
Yeah. It's, uh, it's fine.
It's not great.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.514
Honestly, I'm thinking
of moving on to something else,

15:16.516 --> 15:19.050
maybe getting into teaching,
maybe writing.

15:19.052 --> 15:21.419
- Maybe astronaut?
- Okay.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.388
I just don't think my heart's
in this anymore, you know?

15:23.390 --> 15:25.690
I miss the days when we were
just a scrappy start-up.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.392
It's a job.

15:27.394 --> 15:30.228
What is it with you young people
having to love your work?

15:30.230 --> 15:32.664
I don't have to love my work.
It's just -- I don't know.

15:32.666 --> 15:35.233
It'd be great if I wasn't
miserable while I was there.

15:35.235 --> 15:38.002
Sometimes I wonder how you got
so picky.

15:38.004 --> 15:39.704
You spoiled me?

15:40.407 --> 15:42.974
So it seems like Gina's
been staying over a lot lately.

15:42.976 --> 15:45.310
Yeah.
That's getting pretty serious.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.678
Oh.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.347
- We are horrible today.
- Yeah.

15:49.349 --> 15:51.416
What's uh,
what's "pretty serious" mean?

15:51.418 --> 15:53.618
Well, I just proposed to her.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.586
What?

15:55.588 --> 15:57.288
Yeah. We're getting married
end of October.

15:57.290 --> 15:59.023
Jesus Christ!

15:59.025 --> 16:00.625
When were you gonna tell me?

16:00.627 --> 16:02.293
Now.
This is it -- me telling you.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.128
Dad, Gina's like half your age.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.630
So?
She makes me happy, Ben.

16:05.632 --> 16:07.465
Yeah.
So did Mom once.

16:08.201 --> 16:11.502
Yeah, and we gave it
our best shot for 16 years.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.339
Dad, I-I just feel like
maybe marriage...

16:14.341 --> 16:16.007
isn't your thing, you know?

16:16.009 --> 16:18.643
I mean, you've already had two
that have failed.

16:18.645 --> 16:20.645
I don't view either of them
as failures.

16:20.647 --> 16:24.182
I'm just asking you...
to pace yourself

16:24.184 --> 16:26.284
so you don't make the
same mistakes you have before.

16:26.286 --> 16:29.287
Gina would like to get to know
you over dinner this weekend.

16:29.289 --> 16:32.256
All of us.
I'd like you to come by.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.993
You know what?
I-I actually can't.

16:34.995 --> 16:37.261
I told a friend
I'd go to a wedding with her.

16:37.263 --> 16:38.997
Maybe next weekend?

16:38.999 --> 16:40.765
Yeah.
We'll see.

16:43.036 --> 16:45.370
I know. It's -- I know.
I got it. I got it.

16:45.372 --> 16:48.039
So Sarah may not know
how to jet ski...

16:49.376 --> 16:52.677
...but she's a pretty good
little sister.

16:52.679 --> 16:56.047
Anyway, the question
will always remain --

16:56.049 --> 16:57.415
Which came first,

16:57.417 --> 17:01.152
Jason's proposal...
or Sarah's pregnancy?

17:01.154 --> 17:03.621
Real chicken-or-the-egg
situation there.

17:05.692 --> 17:07.458
But we're all, uh, super excited

17:07.460 --> 17:09.193
to have a ba--
new baby in the family.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.130
So... congrats, you guys.

meet each other

17:58.111 --> 17:59.710
and they instantly fall in love,

17:59.712 --> 18:02.847
like when you reach for the same
cereal at the grocery store

18:02.849 --> 18:04.482
and it's adorable,
and you're like, "Oh, my God.

18:04.484 --> 18:06.150

to take on the love marathon
together --

19:18.358 --> 19:20.491
just like gang-bang it.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.326
That's 10 weddings between us.

19:22.328 --> 19:24.195
And I got some rough ones
coming up.

19:24.197 --> 19:27.398
Come on. How else are you gonna
find single girls like that?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.400
You know,
I actually do just fine

19:46.319 --> 19:47.852
I'll be your wingman.

19:47.854 --> 19:51.255

20:01.301 --> 20:02.900
...as enticing as that sounds,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.403
I'm not really looking to go
around just banging bridesmaids.

20:05.405 --> 20:07.205
I know.
I'm not saying that.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.974
This is about exposure
to relationship opportunities.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.576
Move.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.344
Your wingmen are gone.

20:13.346 --> 20:14.712
W-What are you gonna do?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.581
You gonna hit the club solo

20:16.583 --> 20:20.384
after pounding vodka Red Bulls
in your apartment by yourself?

20:20.386 --> 20:23.321
Ooh.
That is bleak, man.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.722
Why do you want this so much?

20:24.724 --> 20:27.225
'Cause...

20:27.227 --> 20:29.994
Ben, this is gonna be so much
worse if we do it on our own.

20:29.996 --> 20:32.363
We'll be stuck
at singles' tables

20:32.365 --> 20:37.735
and shelling out for hotel rooms
to sleep in -- alone.

20:38.938 --> 20:40.571
At least I'd have a bed
to myself.

20:40.573 --> 20:42.673
- Oh, my God. Come on.
- I'd rather not share.

20:42.675 --> 20:44.976
I share beds with my girlfriends
all the time.

20:44.978 --> 20:47.745
Well, I'm not a girl, Alice.
I'm a full-blown man.

20:49.515 --> 20:50.915
A full-blown --

20:50.917 --> 20:52.617
I'm not going
to any more weddings with you.

20:52.619 --> 20:54.919
- No!
- Go to bed.

20:56.256 --> 20:58.322
I'm not tired.

21:07.300 --> 21:09.967
What are you doing?
You're on my side.

21:09.969 --> 21:11.602
- I just want to cuddle.
- No.

21:11.604 --> 21:12.803
No cuddling.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.705
What?
You don't like cuddling?

21:14.707 --> 21:15.940
I love cuddling.

21:15.942 --> 21:18.042
I just don't want to cuddle
with you.

21:19.345 --> 21:21.846
No. Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Line.

21:21.848 --> 21:23.481
Line of demarcation right here,

21:23.483 --> 21:25.016
right down the middle
of the bed.

21:25.018 --> 21:27.451
You cross this line,
you're entering foreign airspace

21:27.453 --> 21:28.719
and you'll be shot
out of the sky.

21:28.721 --> 21:30.388
It's just cuddling.

21:30.390 --> 21:31.789
No.

21:31.791 --> 21:32.990
No way. No.

21:32.992 --> 21:34.792
- Not fair.
- Not fair?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.594
If I get a boner, you'll think
I think you're attractive,

21:36.596 --> 21:37.795
and you'll never let me
live that down.

21:37.797 --> 21:39.497
Oh, my God.
Okay.

21:39.499 --> 21:41.799
I promise I won't read
any subtext into your boner.

21:41.801 --> 21:43.534
- You're gonna read the boner.
- I'm not.

21:43.536 --> 21:45.069
Well, let's say I don't get
a boner

21:45.071 --> 21:46.904
and you can't fall asleep

21:46.906 --> 21:48.773
because my flaccid penis
is making you feel ugly.

21:48.775 --> 21:52.076
Jesus. Are you always
this big of a spaz in bed?

21:52.078 --> 21:56.380
No. I just -- I just don't
want to cuddle with you, okay?

21:56.382 --> 21:58.482
Cuddling doesn't have to be
sexual.

21:58.484 --> 22:00.384
It can be about feeling close
to someone.

22:00.386 --> 22:03.754
I feel close enough to you
over here.

22:07.860 --> 22:09.360
What if I'm big spoon?

22:09.362 --> 22:10.828
No. No.
No.

22:10.830 --> 22:13.597
You're not cradling my body.
That's horrifying.

22:15.435 --> 22:16.734
What about tickle scratching?

22:16.736 --> 22:19.036
What the fuck
is tickle scratching?

22:19.038 --> 22:23.007
We, like -- We scratch each
other's backs in a gentle way,

22:23.009 --> 22:24.408
but it's not weird.

22:24.410 --> 22:25.710
It's like...

22:26.713 --> 22:27.712
What?

22:27.714 --> 22:30.381
Oh, God damn it.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.459
Alice.

22:41.461 --> 22:42.927
What?

22:42.929 --> 22:45.596
I'll do the wedding thing
with you.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.532
Really?

22:49.001 --> 22:50.534
Yeah.

22:51.137 --> 22:52.703
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

22:52.705 --> 22:55.005
Oh.
Okay.

22:56.075 --> 22:57.541
Ben?

22:57.543 --> 22:58.676
Yeah.

22:58.678 --> 23:00.911
- Can you feel my boner?
- No.

23:00.913 --> 23:03.781
Um, Paul...

23:03.783 --> 23:05.783
Oh, God.
Great times.

23:05.785 --> 23:08.953
Paul, remember the late-night
taco trips in college?

23:08.955 --> 23:11.922
We used to --
I don't know if you guys know.

23:11.924 --> 23:15.659
We used to go -- We used to walk
through the drive-through

23:15.661 --> 23:21.699
and, like, uh, and order...
all of these tacos.

23:21.701 --> 23:24.802
Uh... you know?

23:24.804 --> 23:27.805
Uh... Sorry.

23:28.141 --> 23:30.741
I lost my place.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.711
Oh, one second.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.692
Ugh.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.027
What is that smell?

23:50.029 --> 23:51.929
I tried to warn you.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.064
And look at this.
It's got two beds.

23:54.066 --> 23:56.434
My dear, look at this.

23:56.436 --> 24:00.438
Two whole beds
for two human adults.

24:00.440 --> 24:04.575
Yeah.
Yeah, this chateau is marvelous.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.444
- Benjy --
- What is this voice?

24:06.446 --> 24:07.578
- What is it?
- It's Australian.

24:07.580 --> 24:09.013
- Is it?
- Yeah.

24:09.015 --> 24:13.484
Do you join me for some caviar
on the veranda.

24:13.486 --> 24:14.718
Whatever.

24:14.720 --> 24:15.920
This place is fucking
disgusting.

24:15.922 --> 24:17.455
I'm gonna change
and go to the pool.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.023
Okay.

24:24.697 --> 24:25.896
Hey, man.

24:27.133 --> 24:28.532
Okay.

24:28.534 --> 24:30.034
Joshua.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.969
Joshua, will you not do that,
please?

24:31.971 --> 24:34.138
You freak people out
when you do that.

24:34.140 --> 24:36.073
That little fucker's
gonna kill someone someday.

24:36.075 --> 24:37.608
I just know it.

24:37.610 --> 24:39.710
You know, the other day,
he asked me for my teeth

24:39.712 --> 24:41.011
so that he could eat them.

24:44.116 --> 24:46.116
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to laugh.

24:46.118 --> 24:47.852
No.
It's fine.

24:47.854 --> 24:49.820
I do.
I have a demon child.

24:51.157 --> 24:52.890
- I'm Ellie, by the way.
- Hi.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.525
- This is, uh, Maggie.
- Hey.

24:54.527 --> 24:55.726
I'm Alice.

24:55.728 --> 24:56.961
- You here for the wedding?
- Yeah.

24:56.963 --> 24:58.162
You friends with Paul
or Marissa?

24:58.164 --> 24:59.530
Uh, neither.

24:59.532 --> 25:02.800
I'm, uh,
I'm that guy's plus one.

25:03.169 --> 25:04.902
- Oh.
- Hm.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.071
- So you're one of <i> those</i> girls.
- One of what?

25:07.073 --> 25:09.006
One of those Asian girls
that only dates white guys.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.709
- Oh, my God.
- No, I'm not. That's insane.

25:11.711 --> 25:13.777
I -- My ex was Asian.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.579
"Was"?
Did he die?

25:15.581 --> 25:17.615
Yeah.
I'd like to think that he did.

25:17.617 --> 25:19.783
Seems to me like you're due
for a white guy.

25:19.785 --> 25:21.852
- Am I?
- It's the Ping-Pong Effect.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.855
You always date the opposite
of the person you just dated.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.992
Are Asians and whites opposite?

25:27.994 --> 25:29.593
Oh, my God.
You'll have to excuse my sister.

25:29.595 --> 25:31.662
She has a tendency to be racist.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.931
I just want to know
if she's smashing that hot guy

25:33.933 --> 25:34.932
in the pool.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.233
What, Ben?

25:36.235 --> 25:38.235
- God, no.
- Why not?

25:38.237 --> 25:41.238
'Cause Ben doesn't date people.
He dates ideas.

25:41.240 --> 25:44.575
And trust me,
I'm not his type of idea. Blah.

25:44.577 --> 25:46.944
Well, what is his type of idea?

25:46.946 --> 25:48.178
Why?
Are you interested?

25:48.180 --> 25:50.714
I haven't talked to him,
but he's cute.

25:50.716 --> 25:52.616
Well, I can totally
hook that shit up.

25:52.618 --> 25:55.286
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah, for sure.

25:57.590 --> 26:01.091
It has not been an easy ride.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.793
And I know that.

26:02.795 --> 26:04.895
And I know
what I've put you through.

26:05.264 --> 26:07.665
And I know how I can be.

26:07.667 --> 26:09.199
I can be tough.

26:10.036 --> 26:11.702
But you're always there...

26:11.704 --> 26:13.137
It's so fucking hot.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.773
...always ready
to catch me when I fall.

26:15.775 --> 26:18.208
Always my best friend.

26:18.210 --> 26:20.044
- I need to pee.
- If we can just sit on the couch

26:20.046 --> 26:22.146
and eat Chinese food and watch
"The Great British Bake Off"

26:22.148 --> 26:24.248
- for the rest of our lives...
- I'm gonna make a run for it.

26:24.250 --> 26:26.584
No. Wait. Wait. Wait.
I think we're nearing the end.

26:26.586 --> 26:28.686
...because we're gonna raise
beautiful babies!

26:28.688 --> 26:29.954
He's fucking talking
about babies.

26:29.956 --> 26:31.288
I'm literally gonna piss myself.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.791
Can you tell your girlfriend
to keep it down?

26:33.793 --> 26:35.926
I'm sorry, but she's
literally gonna piss herself.

26:35.928 --> 26:37.161
And I'm not his girlfriend.

26:37.163 --> 26:39.196
That's disgusting
and presumptuous.

26:39.198 --> 26:41.765
May the blessings of life
and the joy of love

26:41.767 --> 26:43.367
be your constant companion.

26:43.369 --> 26:45.603
You may now seal your union
with a kiss.

26:46.872 --> 26:48.172
Let's go.

26:48.174 --> 26:49.640
Yes!

26:49.642 --> 26:51.842
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Excuse me.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.111
Ah! Ben, this is Maggie.
She's into you, okay?

26:54.113 --> 26:57.081
Have fun. Don't fuck it up.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

26:57.083 --> 26:58.949
That was... unexpected.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.884
Yeah.
She does that.

27:00.886 --> 27:03.120
Uh, do you want to get a beer?

27:03.689 --> 27:05.122
Yeah.
I'd love to.

27:05.124 --> 27:06.824
Maybe just let them finish up
first.

27:06.826 --> 27:08.392
Of course.
Yeah.

27:08.394 --> 27:10.894
Great job, guys.

27:11.197 --> 27:13.631
All right.

27:13.633 --> 27:15.032
Everybody --
Everybody, on your cups!

27:15.034 --> 27:16.367
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

27:54.206 --> 27:55.272
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

27:55.274 --> 27:57.007
Like, you think I'd win?

27:57.009 --> 28:00.144
You're good-looking enough
to get far

28:00.146 --> 28:02.379
but not good-looking enough
to win.

28:02.381 --> 28:04.314
What does good-looking
have to do with "Survivor"?

28:04.316 --> 28:06.283
You got to be built.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.986
You got to be fuckin'...

28:08.988 --> 28:10.154
and survive.

28:10.156 --> 28:13.357
The question was
how are you <i> so</i> bad?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.292
- It was -- Okay.
- How are you <i> so</i> bad?

28:15.294 --> 28:17.194
I -- Look. Okay.
I'm bad at flip cup.

28:17.196 --> 28:19.063
I'm -- I'm saying it.
I'm admitting it.

28:19.065 --> 28:20.464
I'm bad at flip cup!

28:20.466 --> 28:22.399
- He's bad at flip cup.
- I'm bad at flip cup.

28:23.969 --> 28:26.904
Uh, hey, truth or dare.

28:26.906 --> 28:28.439
Truth.

28:28.441 --> 28:32.376
Okay. I truth you
to close your eyes.

28:52.264 --> 28:54.231
- This is bad.
- Oh, really?

28:54.233 --> 28:57.201
The diner tilapia
wasn't a winner?

28:57.203 --> 28:59.069
That's a shocker.

28:59.071 --> 29:00.771
How was Maggie?

29:00.773 --> 29:03.407
Um... she was good.

29:03.409 --> 29:06.143
Yeah, you know, she was...
she was really --

29:06.145 --> 29:08.078
Yeah.
She was cool.

29:08.914 --> 29:11.014
Wow.
You must really like her.

29:11.016 --> 29:12.850
I don't -- I don't know.
I just, um...

29:12.852 --> 29:14.918
I don't think we have
that long-term potential,

29:14.920 --> 29:16.386
but I had a fun time with her.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.088
You spent one night with her.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.190
How can you possibly know
what kind of potential you have?

29:20.192 --> 29:22.960
Alice, when you've been single
as long as I have,

29:22.962 --> 29:24.828
you know what you want.

29:24.830 --> 29:27.331
And when you know what you want,
you can cut bait way quicker.

29:27.333 --> 29:29.066
Yeah, but you <i> don't</i> know
what you want.

29:29.068 --> 29:30.934
You have the worst standards.

29:30.936 --> 29:32.870
I have realistic standards.

29:32.872 --> 29:34.438
I do.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.206
What about Jess Ramsey?

29:36.208 --> 29:37.975
I would date her,
but she's engaged.

29:37.977 --> 29:39.510
Why do you always say
her first and last name

29:39.512 --> 29:41.311
like some sort of serial killer?

29:41.313 --> 29:42.880
'Cause she's a firsty-lasty.

29:42.882 --> 29:44.448
It's the same thing with me.
I'm Ben King.

29:44.450 --> 29:47.151
You're just jealous 'cause
you're not a firsty-lasty --

29:47.153 --> 29:48.552
- Alice Mori.
- All right. Fine.

29:48.554 --> 29:51.221
Let's pretend,
for the sake of this argument,

29:51.223 --> 29:53.023
Jess Ramsey gets divorced
tomorrow.

29:53.025 --> 29:55.292
She shows up on your doorstep,
and she's like,

29:55.294 --> 30:00.264
"Oh, my God, Ben King!
Let's be together! Unh!"

30:00.266 --> 30:02.232
That's not an impression
of anything.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.934
You wouldn't last two weeks.

30:03.936 --> 30:05.536
You would find something wrong
with her,

30:05.538 --> 30:07.571
- and then you would bail.
- That is not true.

30:07.573 --> 30:09.873
- Yes, it is. It's so true!
- You don't know that.

30:09.875 --> 30:13.010
I'm just trying to make sure the
person I end up with is right.

30:13.012 --> 30:14.578
I'm trying to find, you know...

30:14.580 --> 30:16.013
- Do not say "the one."
- ...the one.

30:16.015 --> 30:17.447
Oh, my God.

30:17.449 --> 30:21.018
You're just... so stupid.

30:21.020 --> 30:22.486
I don't think I am.

30:22.488 --> 30:25.455
Someone as grotesquely tall
and gangly as you

30:25.457 --> 30:27.124
doesn't have the right
to be picky.

30:27.126 --> 30:29.259
Wow.
Thank you so much, Alice.

30:29.261 --> 30:31.528
And what about you?
How was Trevor?

30:31.530 --> 30:34.331
Oh, yeah. Nothing happened.
I just got his number.

30:34.333 --> 30:36.066
- Okay.
- But I just...

30:36.068 --> 30:38.135
I got to do a little
personal maintenance first.

30:38.137 --> 30:39.837
- Yeah. Sure.
- You know what I'm saying?

30:39.839 --> 30:43.841
Got to run the raccoons...
out of the trash cans.

30:43.843 --> 30:45.142
I know --
Alice, I know.

30:45.144 --> 30:47.177
- I got to mow the back lawn.
- I got it.

30:47.179 --> 30:49.012
I've got a hairy ass and vagina.

30:49.014 --> 30:50.914
I heard you.

30:50.916 --> 30:52.449
Alice, these are just excuses.

30:52.451 --> 30:54.218
- You know that.
- They're not excuses.

30:54.220 --> 30:57.588
I'm not in the mood to go
on dates right now. That's it.

30:57.590 --> 31:00.457
Are you gonna spend the rest
of your life moping about Nate?

31:00.459 --> 31:03.193
I'm not moping about Nate.

31:03.195 --> 31:05.495
Fuck! What the --
It's just I...

31:07.399 --> 31:09.533
It takes me a while
to open up to people,

31:09.535 --> 31:12.169
and I just don't want to give
anyone that time right now.

31:12.171 --> 31:14.004
Okay?

31:14.006 --> 31:16.907
How do you <i> not</i> think
that you're moping about Nate?

31:16.909 --> 31:20.244
Every time I've seen you,
you've just been like "Nate!"

31:20.546 --> 31:22.045
- "Nate!"
- I hate when you do my voice.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.580
I literally hate it.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.515
- "Nate!"
- Stop saying it so loud.

31:25.517 --> 31:27.384
Someone here can know
who you're talking about.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.052
- Can you not say --
- Does anyone here know Nate?

31:29.054 --> 31:30.988
Shut the fuck up.

31:56.682 --> 31:58.582
Do you happen to have
a reservation?

31:58.584 --> 32:00.217
No, we don't, actually,
because someone

32:00.219 --> 32:01.618
forgot to book the hotel room
this weekend.

32:01.620 --> 32:03.153
I didn't forget.

32:03.155 --> 32:04.588
I was distracted
when I made the reservation.

32:04.590 --> 32:05.622
Why were you distracted?

32:05.624 --> 32:08.525
Do you have any rooms available?

32:08.527 --> 32:10.560
Yes.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.562
Ah! See? It works out.
It all works out.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.932
We've got one of our, uh,
Brown Bear rooms...

32:14.934 --> 32:16.400
- Cool.
- ...which have two twin beds,

32:16.402 --> 32:20.170
or the Grizzly Suite,
which is completely orange

32:20.172 --> 32:22.940
and has a vibrating
king-size bed.

32:24.677 --> 32:26.977
- I think Brown Bear. Yeah.
- The Brown Bear Room...

32:26.979 --> 32:28.378
- ...sounds good. Yeah.
- That's the... Yeah.

32:28.380 --> 32:32.416
Okay. That'll be $83.50
plus resort tax.

32:32.985 --> 32:35.285
Ooh.
She's got it.

32:35.287 --> 32:36.486
- I got it.
- Yeah.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.989
So what brings you guys
out here?

32:38.991 --> 32:41.358
- We're just here for a wedding.
- God, I love weddings.

32:41.360 --> 32:42.693
I'm trying to get married
myself.

32:42.695 --> 32:44.061
- Oh.
- Oh.

32:44.063 --> 32:45.495
Have you asked your girlfriend?

32:45.497 --> 32:47.664
I don't have a girlfriend.

32:47.666 --> 32:49.499
- Okay. Yeah, okay. Yeah.
- All right.

32:49.501 --> 32:51.034
- Yeah.
- There you go.

32:51.036 --> 32:52.302
Just take a right, a left,
a right,

32:52.304 --> 32:54.271
another right,
you'll be right there.

32:54.273 --> 32:55.572
- Did you get that?
- It says 304.

32:55.574 --> 32:56.707
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

32:56.709 --> 32:57.708
- Thank you.
- Thanks, Steve.

32:57.710 --> 32:59.242
Have a great stay.

33:01.347 --> 33:03.313
I still can't believe
you took the Communion.

33:03.315 --> 33:05.215
What? Why?
I wanted the cracker.

33:05.217 --> 33:07.217
- Oh, my God. Look at this.
- Mm.

33:07.219 --> 33:09.753
- Here we go.
- Oh, baby.

33:09.755 --> 33:11.655
"Mm. Bully."

33:11.657 --> 33:14.391
"Yes, Johnson, I'm very happy we
could sign this merger today."

33:14.393 --> 33:16.326
"Me too, Mr. Phillips.

33:16.328 --> 33:18.261
I'm very excited
to commit fraud with you!"

33:18.263 --> 33:20.397
- Here we go.
- Yes. Yes, yes, yes.

33:20.399 --> 33:22.699
"Hi. We are Umlaut.

33:22.701 --> 33:26.036
We are the new
Swedish boy-band sensation."

33:26.038 --> 33:28.772
"Yes, our new hit single,
'My Stepdad's House, '

33:28.774 --> 33:30.574
is climbing the charts."

33:30.576 --> 33:32.576
What is this?

33:32.578 --> 33:34.244
What is this?

33:34.246 --> 33:36.013
- Okay, guys.
- What...

33:36.015 --> 33:37.280
Here we go.

33:37.282 --> 33:38.582
- Whoo!
- What?

33:38.584 --> 33:40.183
I have no idea what's going on.

33:45.257 --> 33:47.057
All right.
What have we got?

33:47.059 --> 33:49.693
I see cuties, cuties everywhere.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.228
Yeah.
Let's see.

33:51.230 --> 33:52.229
Mm.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.364
Red dress with the boots.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.133
Mm, no.
No, she looks mean.

33:56.135 --> 33:58.769
What? She just looks serious.
That doesn't mean mean.

33:58.771 --> 34:01.371
It means mean.
Um, let's see.

34:01.373 --> 34:05.242
Okay. What about, um,
green with the glasses?

34:05.244 --> 34:07.277
- Where? Rotate.
- Okay.

34:09.447 --> 34:10.647
Her?

34:10.649 --> 34:13.550
Geez. God, you like them
fresh and young.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.485
What --
She's normal age.

34:15.487 --> 34:17.721
Ben, I can hear the sirens
coming for you.

34:17.723 --> 34:19.589
Fuck off. Mnh-mnh.

34:19.591 --> 34:21.291
Okay. All right.
Let's see.

34:21.293 --> 34:23.427
Um... okay.

34:23.429 --> 34:25.094
Bridesmaid with the braid.

34:25.097 --> 34:26.496
You're gonna have to
spin me out.

34:26.498 --> 34:28.331
- Okay.
- Ready? One, two, three.

34:30.668 --> 34:32.636
- Yeah. Yeah, she'll do.
- Cool.

34:32.638 --> 34:35.338
I'm gonna spill a drink on her
when the song ends,

34:35.340 --> 34:36.572
and you're gonna go up to her

34:36.574 --> 34:38.175
with some napkins
and a good opening line.

34:38.177 --> 34:40.077
Can you maybe not assault
this one?

34:40.079 --> 34:41.545
It's not assault.
I just --

34:41.547 --> 34:44.281
I have a very physical style
of breaking the ice.

34:44.283 --> 34:46.583
That's one of the definitions
of assault.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.851
Whatever.
It's been working, has it not?

34:48.853 --> 34:50.454
Yeah.

34:50.456 --> 34:52.355
Yeah.
Yeah, it has.

34:52.357 --> 34:54.257
- Somehow it has.
- Thank you.

34:54.259 --> 34:57.727
Oh, this is hot.

34:57.729 --> 34:59.696
Oh, you guys better stop,
drop, and roll.

34:59.698 --> 35:02.132
Oh, oh, oh!

35:02.134 --> 35:05.268
Too hot. Too hot.

35:05.270 --> 35:06.770
Oh.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.772
Please stop.

35:09.508 --> 35:12.242
Uh, this has been
kind of a tough year for me.

35:12.244 --> 35:15.545
Um, you guys know that.
But, um, this is not about me.

35:15.547 --> 35:18.415
Today's about Barb and Kyle.

35:18.417 --> 35:21.151
I'm so proud of you guys.
I love you.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.687
♪ When I'm alone ♪

35:23.689 --> 35:28.225
♪ I find it hard to breathe ♪

35:28.227 --> 35:33.897
♪ She walked out
and she took half of me ♪

35:48.413 --> 35:50.180
What a ceremony, huh?

35:50.182 --> 35:51.748
- Mm.
- Loved the vows.

35:51.750 --> 35:53.783
Cried.
Cried like a baby.

35:53.785 --> 35:55.152
Anybody else cry?

35:56.155 --> 35:57.621
Yeah.
I cried.

35:57.623 --> 36:01.191
but I cry every day,
so it doesn't mean anything.

36:01.193 --> 36:03.493
Crying can be very therapeutic.

36:03.495 --> 36:05.395
Not the way I do it.

36:06.598 --> 36:08.398
So you two met in college?

36:08.400 --> 36:09.633
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.568
Ben, you know,
he basically used me

36:11.570 --> 36:13.603
to get close to my roommate
so they could date.

36:13.605 --> 36:15.572
- This is not true.
- Uh-oh. Intrigue.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.907
It's a little true.

36:16.909 --> 36:18.642
- Go on. Go.
- I'm just kidding.

36:18.644 --> 36:20.377
It's fine.
It's fine. No.

36:20.379 --> 36:21.945
They only dated
for a couple of months.

36:21.947 --> 36:25.215
But our friendship,
that lasts a lifetime.

36:25.217 --> 36:27.384
- Aw.
- Aw.

36:27.386 --> 36:29.586
- She should come to the wedding.
- Of course.

36:29.588 --> 36:32.589
Alice, you should come
to our wedding.

36:32.591 --> 36:33.957
Oh.

36:33.959 --> 36:36.860
Uh, I didn't know you guys...
When is it?

36:36.862 --> 36:38.195
October 21st.

36:38.197 --> 36:39.829
- It's on a Sunday.
- Cool.

36:39.831 --> 36:41.264
You're getting an invite,
young lady,

36:41.266 --> 36:42.866
and that's the end of it.

36:42.868 --> 36:44.701
Okay.
Great.

36:44.703 --> 36:47.404
Um, you know what?
I'm gonna grab a drink.

36:47.406 --> 36:49.339
- Do you guys want anything?
- Mnh-mnh.

36:49.341 --> 36:50.974
Shots? Shots?
Shots all around?

36:50.976 --> 36:52.342
Shots for Gina?

36:52.344 --> 36:54.277
- No.
- I'm fine with my wine.

36:54.279 --> 36:55.712
- Okay.
- Thanks!

36:56.982 --> 36:58.582
She's adorable.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.784
Ben, I see
a lot of potential there.

37:00.786 --> 37:02.652
No. It's not --
It's not like that.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.754
We're just --
We're just friends.

37:05.757 --> 37:06.890
Ben.

37:06.892 --> 37:08.491
Oh, you're coming over.
Awesome.

37:08.493 --> 37:11.294
Sorry we got off
on such a bad foot last month.

37:11.730 --> 37:15.432
Yeah. Um...
can we not talk about this here?

37:15.434 --> 37:16.967
Well, you won't return my texts.

37:16.969 --> 37:18.635
You only text me
at like 5:00 in the morning.

37:18.637 --> 37:20.570
- I'm an early riser.
- Okay.

37:20.572 --> 37:24.407
Ben... I want you to be
my best man.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.378
- Dad.
- No.

37:28.380 --> 37:31.314
Buddy, there's nobody else
I would want to do this.

37:31.316 --> 37:32.949
- What about Hanon?
- What about him?

37:32.951 --> 37:34.718
Make your best friend
your best man.

37:34.720 --> 37:36.586
Hanon?
That's ridiculous.

37:36.588 --> 37:38.989
He was Joe's best man,
and his entire speech was about

37:38.991 --> 37:41.725
how there wasn't enough cheese
at the wedding.

37:41.727 --> 37:45.428
Ben... you're my son.

37:48.433 --> 37:50.734
Uh, I'll -- I'll think about it.

37:56.775 --> 37:57.841
What can I get you?

37:57.843 --> 37:59.943
Can I get a tequila straight up?

37:59.945 --> 38:02.445
Fill it up like a gas tank.

38:02.447 --> 38:04.447
- That's a first.
- Yeah.

38:05.917 --> 38:07.751
Oh, my God. Alice.

38:07.753 --> 38:09.986
- Oh, my God. Hi, Jenna!
- Hi!

38:09.988 --> 38:11.621
- Hey.
- How are you?

38:11.623 --> 38:13.690
- Good. How are you?
- So good.

38:13.692 --> 38:15.525
I had no idea
that you were gonna be here.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.428
Yeah. I didn't know
<i>you</i> were gonna be here.

38:18.430 --> 38:20.864
Yeah. This is Alice.
This is Nate Lam's girlfriend.

38:20.866 --> 38:22.966
- Oh.
- Oh, my God. I love Nate.

38:22.968 --> 38:24.968
We, uh, we interned at Merrill
together.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.503
How is that stupid bastard?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.471
Um, he's g--
You know, I don't know.

38:28.473 --> 38:29.539
We -- We broke up.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.707
- No.
- Yeah.

38:30.709 --> 38:31.975
Shit.

38:31.977 --> 38:33.677
- No.
- Yeah.

38:33.679 --> 38:35.512
- Are you kidding?
- No.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.048
What happened?
I loved you guys together.

38:38.050 --> 38:40.817
You guys were like yin and yang.

38:40.819 --> 38:42.652
- I loved them together.
- Yeah.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.954
Yeah.
I bet I-I would have.

38:44.956 --> 38:46.756
Alice?

38:46.758 --> 38:49.592
Okay.
What the fuck was that?

39:10.048 --> 39:11.581
Wait, wait.

39:11.583 --> 39:14.084
That shadow looks
just like Jay Leno's face.

39:14.086 --> 39:15.952
You're absolutely right.

39:15.954 --> 39:18.121
That's his nose.
That's his chin.

39:18.123 --> 39:20.357
- His nose and his chin.
- And the chin.

39:20.359 --> 39:21.825
Benjamin!

39:21.827 --> 39:23.560
- Uncle Davis.
- Ben!

39:23.562 --> 39:25.061
- Hi. Hey, guys.
- Come on, Ben.

39:25.063 --> 39:26.963
Get in on this doobie, buddy.

39:26.965 --> 39:29.933
Yeah, Ben.
Get in on this doobie.

39:29.935 --> 39:32.836
Uh, no, thanks. I'm all good
on doobies for the night.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.372
Where's your dad?
He used to love this stuff.

39:35.374 --> 39:36.973
- He's inside.
- Ah.

39:36.975 --> 39:39.876
Here you go, Jimmy.
Your turn.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.480
Oh, okay.
All right, guys.

39:43.482 --> 39:44.814
I'm gonna --
I have to take off.

39:44.816 --> 39:46.549
- Oh.
- I know!

39:46.551 --> 39:48.118
It's a tragedy.
I know.

39:48.120 --> 39:54.124
Oh! Ben's got to run off
with his little girlfriend.

39:54.126 --> 39:55.992
- All right.
- You guys got to --

39:55.994 --> 39:57.894
You got to take it down a notch,
Uncle Davis.

39:57.896 --> 39:59.662
You having fun, huh?

40:00.966 --> 40:02.632
Everything okay?

40:02.634 --> 40:05.869
Yeah. Yeah.
Um, can we go get fucked up?

40:05.871 --> 40:07.771
Oh, Ben, I want you
to know something.

40:07.773 --> 40:09.739
I'm never gonna say no to that.

40:09.741 --> 40:12.709
Come on. Let's go find
some people our own age.

40:12.711 --> 40:14.010
Whoo!

40:28.794 --> 40:31.594
♪ In no solid state ♪

40:32.731 --> 40:35.165
♪ You know we can't cop to ♪

40:35.167 --> 40:40.904
♪ The frequency
of your inner debate ♪

40:42.073 --> 40:45.175
♪ You're all out of tune ♪

40:55.587 --> 40:57.587
Aah!

40:57.589 --> 40:59.122
What was that?

40:59.124 --> 41:02.025
- That was 12 seconds.
- What? That was five minutes.

41:02.027 --> 41:03.960
You think you can hold
your breath for five minutes?

41:03.962 --> 41:05.728
I know I can.

41:05.730 --> 41:10.533
I feel like you vastly
overestimate your abilities.

41:10.535 --> 41:14.170
I think I perfectly estimate
my everything, Ben.

41:14.172 --> 41:16.606
Okay. Fine.

41:16.608 --> 41:18.041
Can I ask you something?

41:18.043 --> 41:19.642
Yeah.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.878
Why didn't you tell me
your dad got engaged?

41:23.482 --> 41:25.949
I don't know.
I don't know.

41:25.951 --> 41:27.684
I really didn't want to
tell you something

41:27.686 --> 41:30.553
that I don't really want to
think about.

41:30.555 --> 41:32.055
Okay.

41:32.057 --> 41:35.225
He, uh, he asked me
to be his best man tonight.

41:35.227 --> 41:36.893
Oh.

41:36.895 --> 41:38.962
Yeah.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.197
What'd you tell him?

41:41.199 --> 41:43.266
I just kind of ran off.

41:43.268 --> 41:44.968
Classic Ben move.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.970
I don't know. I panicked.
I don't know.

41:46.972 --> 41:48.571
What am I supposed to do,
you know?

41:48.573 --> 41:50.573
Like, plan his bachelor party?

41:50.575 --> 41:52.242
Hire him a stripper?

41:52.244 --> 41:54.043
- That's insane.
- It <i> is</i> insane.

41:54.045 --> 41:56.079
- Yeah.
- No, I get it.

41:56.081 --> 41:57.580
I was bugged out at first

41:57.582 --> 41:59.249
when Lily asked me to be
her maid of honor.

41:59.251 --> 42:00.950
Yeah, but that's your sister.

42:00.952 --> 42:04.020
It's perfectly normal for you
to be her maid of honor.

42:04.022 --> 42:06.222
- Yeah.
- It's just...

42:06.224 --> 42:10.126
I feel like he's trying to
start over with this new family

42:10.128 --> 42:12.128
'cause he fucked ours up.

42:14.232 --> 42:15.765
Well, at least he's happy.

42:15.767 --> 42:18.701
Yeah.
For now.

42:21.573 --> 42:24.207
Ben, my parents
don't like each other.

42:25.176 --> 42:30.046
I mean, my mom, she's just --
she's always yelling at my dad.

42:30.048 --> 42:32.715
And he's kind of checked out,
you know?

42:32.717 --> 42:34.317
He just takes it.

42:34.319 --> 42:37.186
They didn't want my sister and I
to have to go through a divorce,

42:37.188 --> 42:39.222
so they just stuck it out.

42:39.224 --> 42:43.560
And it's just --
It's made them so sad.

42:45.130 --> 42:48.831
I think about the two of them
sometimes in that house,

42:48.833 --> 42:53.002
just having dinner in silence,
white-knuckling it.

42:58.843 --> 43:01.177
I'm sure it broke your heart
when your parents split up,

43:01.179 --> 43:03.880
but at least
they're not miserable.

43:03.882 --> 43:06.883
I can guarantee
you would like that a lot less.

43:10.121 --> 43:12.155
- Hey.
- Hmm?

43:12.791 --> 43:14.023
Come here.

43:14.025 --> 43:16.326
Come here.

43:22.200 --> 43:24.233
- Hey, Ben?
- Yeah.

43:24.235 --> 43:27.070
I'm totally reading your boner
right now.

43:27.072 --> 43:30.039
- God damn -- No.
- Relax.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.948
Where -- Where'd everybody go?

43:38.950 --> 43:41.250
I don't -- I don't know.

43:42.754 --> 43:44.787
- Shit.
- Should we --

43:44.789 --> 43:47.123
- We should get out, right?
- Yeah.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.792
Yeah.
Let's go.

43:49.794 --> 43:52.061
Fuck.
It's cold.

43:54.065 --> 43:55.331
Are they out here?

43:55.333 --> 43:57.066
No.
We must have missed the shuttle.

43:57.068 --> 43:58.768
Oh, shit.

43:58.770 --> 44:00.003
Let's call a car.

44:00.005 --> 44:01.771
My phone's dead.

44:01.773 --> 44:02.772
Mine too.

44:02.774 --> 44:04.674
Oh, fuck.

44:04.676 --> 44:05.908
Where's our hotel?

44:05.910 --> 44:09.178
Uh, it's about 10,000 miles
that way.

44:09.180 --> 44:10.980
Only 10,000 miles?

44:10.982 --> 44:12.782
We're gonna die out here.

44:12.784 --> 44:15.118
Let's just walk.
Come on.

44:16.054 --> 44:18.388
Come on, grumps.
Let's do it.

44:18.390 --> 44:20.423
Forward ho!

44:20.425 --> 44:21.891
Are you serious?

44:21.893 --> 44:23.760
I'm not saying I always do it.

44:23.762 --> 44:25.094
That is <i> so</i> gross.

44:25.096 --> 44:27.430
Ben, don't pretend
like you don't let

44:27.432 --> 44:29.666
a little dribble
come out of that 'nanner

44:29.668 --> 44:31.134
when you're in the shower.

44:31.136 --> 44:32.902
I don't let a little dribble

44:32.904 --> 44:35.304
come out the 'nanner
when I'm showering --

44:35.306 --> 44:39.208
If you pee in a shower, it,
by definition, becomes a toilet.

44:39.210 --> 44:41.344
Oh, look at these.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.979
So pretty.

44:42.981 --> 44:45.214
I never understood flowers.

44:45.216 --> 44:48.051
I'm sorry.
You don't understand them?

44:48.053 --> 44:49.986
They just --
They don't make sense to me

44:49.988 --> 44:51.721
as, like, a symbol of love,
you know?

44:51.723 --> 44:52.722
Why not?

44:52.724 --> 44:54.023
Because as soon as you get them,

44:54.025 --> 44:56.025
they're on this withering,
downward spiral.

44:56.027 --> 44:57.960
It's not about
how long they last.

44:57.962 --> 45:00.997
It's about how it feels to get
a big fuckin' sack of tulips.

45:00.999 --> 45:02.365
Yeah.
Gifts shouldn't die on you.

45:02.367 --> 45:04.834
- That's all I'm saying.
- Okay. Wh--

45:04.836 --> 45:06.936
You said you knew
where our hotel was.

45:06.938 --> 45:08.271
And I do.

45:08.273 --> 45:10.440
- Where are we?
- Um...

45:10.442 --> 45:12.041
You don't know
where we're going.

45:12.043 --> 45:13.976
Let's -- Let's go this way.

45:17.348 --> 45:19.415
Oh, we're so lost.

45:19.417 --> 45:21.384
I think we might need to
start hitchhiking.

45:21.386 --> 45:23.119
My feet hurt.

45:23.121 --> 45:25.455
I'm carrying you.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.492
I can see the whole world
from up here.

45:29.494 --> 45:31.160
- Wait. Hold on.
- Oy.

45:31.162 --> 45:33.396
Look. Look.

45:36.167 --> 45:38.201
Spooky.

45:38.203 --> 45:39.802
- Wait. Wait.
- What?

45:39.804 --> 45:41.804
I can hear the highway
over there. Let's go.

45:41.806 --> 45:43.473
- Oh. Hold on.
- What?

45:43.475 --> 45:45.842
You got to hold your breath
when you go through a cemetery.

45:45.844 --> 45:47.376
Oh, yeah, yeah. Right.
'Cause we're 6.

45:47.378 --> 45:49.145
No. Ben.
I'm not fucking around here.

45:49.147 --> 45:51.080
I'm serious.

45:51.082 --> 45:52.415
Oh, my God.

45:52.417 --> 45:53.783
What?

45:53.785 --> 45:55.518
You actually believe in ghosts.

45:55.520 --> 45:56.853
No.

46:10.902 --> 46:12.235
Ah.

46:12.771 --> 46:14.871
- Aah! Fuck.
- Oh, shit. Shit.

46:14.873 --> 46:16.806
You okay?

46:16.808 --> 46:18.474
Oh, my God.
You really ate shit.

46:18.476 --> 46:19.876
- You all right?
- Yeah.

46:19.878 --> 46:21.778
- You good?
- Aah.

46:21.780 --> 46:23.112
Look at that.

46:23.114 --> 46:25.982
Oh, you are <i> bleeding.</i>
You are bleeding.

46:25.984 --> 46:28.451
You are not gonna make it.
Hold on, hold, on, hold on.

46:28.453 --> 46:29.919
- No, it's fine. I'm fine.
- I got it.

46:29.921 --> 46:31.354
- Let me just get the scrape.
- Ow. Ow.

46:31.356 --> 46:34.023
It stings.

47:01.419 --> 47:02.852
Ow. Okay.
Hold on.

47:02.854 --> 47:04.153
- Ah. Sorry.
- You're good. Yeah.

47:04.155 --> 47:05.822
- Here. Take it.
- What?

47:05.824 --> 47:08.224
- Underwear.
- Oh. Okay. Yeah.

47:09.327 --> 47:11.160
Oh. Oh, don't --

47:11.162 --> 47:13.229
What are you doing?

47:13.231 --> 47:14.864
Fuck.

47:14.866 --> 47:16.866
- Okay. Okay, okay. I got it.
- Okay.

47:16.868 --> 47:18.134
- Mm.
- Mm.

47:18.136 --> 47:19.502
- I want to be on top.
- Okay.

47:19.504 --> 47:21.470
Ow. Okay. You good?

47:21.472 --> 47:22.905
- Yeah.
- Hold on. Hold on.

47:22.907 --> 47:24.540
- Okay. All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

47:26.611 --> 47:28.010
Oh.

47:34.853 --> 47:36.919
Ow! My hair. My hair.
My hair. My hair. Ow.

47:40.225 --> 47:42.225
Cooter's out.

47:45.396 --> 47:46.896
Uh, what?

47:46.898 --> 47:48.497
Cooter's out.

47:48.499 --> 47:49.899
What are you talking about?

47:49.901 --> 47:50.967
Cooter.

47:50.969 --> 47:53.002
Oh, fucking hell!
God!

47:53.004 --> 47:55.004
- It's out.
- Huh.

47:55.006 --> 47:57.006
- Sorry.
- Thank you.

47:57.008 --> 47:58.875
Uh-huh.

47:58.877 --> 48:01.077
- He was talking about my vagina.
- Yeah.

48:01.079 --> 48:03.112
Yeah, I put that together
after the third "cooter."

48:03.114 --> 48:04.280
Jesus.

48:36.581 --> 48:40.016
Oh.
Thank you.

48:41.953 --> 48:43.619
Um...

48:43.621 --> 48:45.087
You good?

48:45.089 --> 48:47.423
Yeah.
You?

48:47.425 --> 48:48.958
Yeah.
You?

48:49.427 --> 48:50.927
You just asked me that.

48:50.929 --> 48:52.194
Yeah.
You?

48:55.366 --> 48:56.565
Okay.

48:56.567 --> 48:59.201
Well, I'll see you
at the next one.

48:59.203 --> 49:01.103
Hey, so, about last night.

49:01.105 --> 49:03.339
No. No.

49:03.341 --> 49:05.441
We don't need to talk about it.
Let's just --

49:05.443 --> 49:08.244
Let's just chalk it up
as a whoopsie-daisy.

49:08.680 --> 49:10.246
Wow.

49:10.248 --> 49:11.614
Okay.

49:12.283 --> 49:14.317
- All right.
- All right.

49:16.387 --> 49:19.255
It was, uh, cool...
cool sex.

49:19.257 --> 49:22.258
You got -- Sorry. All right.
Bring it in.

49:23.294 --> 49:24.560
That was weird.

49:24.562 --> 49:27.029
- You made it weird.
- No. You did.

49:35.740 --> 49:41.277
For those of you who aren't sure
if you've ever seen true love,

49:41.279 --> 49:45.481
take a good look
at Dave and Julia.

49:46.417 --> 49:48.150
Congratulations, you guys.

50:00.198 --> 50:02.164
- Hey. What's up?
- Uh, I was just calling

50:02.166 --> 50:04.734
'cause I forgot when your flight
was getting in.

50:04.736 --> 50:07.503
Uh, like 3:00.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.238
Cool. Thursday?

50:09.240 --> 50:11.207
- Friday.
- Right.

50:11.776 --> 50:13.743
- I'll see you there.
- Have a good one.

50:13.745 --> 50:17.013
You know what? Actua--
Okay, you're gone.

50:37.568 --> 50:39.502
Ben?!

50:39.504 --> 50:41.070
Ben King?!

50:41.072 --> 50:42.505
Oh, my God!

50:42.507 --> 50:44.206
Alice?
Alice Mori?

50:44.208 --> 50:46.642
- Ha! God, this is crazy!
- Is that you?

50:46.644 --> 50:48.611
- How long has it been?
- It has been forever.

50:48.613 --> 50:50.813
Oh, my God. I love what you've
done with your hair.

50:50.815 --> 50:54.183
Oh, thank you. Yes.
Your face-lift is horrifying.

50:54.185 --> 50:55.751
Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.

50:55.753 --> 50:57.753
I cannot move my face.

50:57.755 --> 50:59.688
You know,
the last time I saw Ben here,

50:59.690 --> 51:02.058
he was putting his little
penisaurus inside me

51:02.060 --> 51:04.126
in a graveyard.

51:04.128 --> 51:05.761
Isn't that right?

51:07.331 --> 51:08.664
All right.

51:08.666 --> 51:10.566
Thank you.

51:12.503 --> 51:15.504
Holy shit!

51:15.506 --> 51:18.841
This is a fucking --
It's huge!

51:18.843 --> 51:22.445
Look at this big room.
God!

51:24.148 --> 51:26.415
So comfy!

51:27.452 --> 51:29.318
You can't afford this.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.120
- Oh, we're splitting it.
- Okay. Yeah.

51:31.122 --> 51:33.456
We'll see about that.

51:35.393 --> 51:36.625
Did you do this?

51:38.563 --> 51:41.764
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

51:41.766 --> 51:43.532
Wow!

51:43.534 --> 51:47.136
Oh, my God!
This is fuck--

51:47.138 --> 51:49.338
This is incredible!

51:49.340 --> 51:50.706
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

51:53.644 --> 51:54.810
So, how you been?

51:54.812 --> 51:57.513
So fuckin' awesome.
You?

51:57.515 --> 52:00.182
Good.
I've been crazy busy.

52:00.184 --> 52:02.118
Oh, yeah.
Totally.

52:02.120 --> 52:03.385
Totally.

52:03.387 --> 52:04.854
Hey, so,
I told a couple of my friends

52:04.856 --> 52:06.655
I'd meet them by the pool
in a little bit.

52:06.657 --> 52:08.624
You're welcome to come
if you want,

52:08.626 --> 52:11.360
or, uh, you can just stay here
and get yourself situated.

52:11.362 --> 52:12.895
I know you had a long flight.

52:12.897 --> 52:14.530
Mm. Yeah.

52:14.532 --> 52:17.166
Yeah, I think I'll
just hang back and situate.

52:17.168 --> 52:18.601
Well, fuck you.
I'm coming.

52:18.603 --> 52:19.902
God!

52:19.904 --> 52:23.672
No. It was just really simple.
It was kind of out of nowhere.

52:23.674 --> 52:25.141
And he was like,
"Do you want to get married?"

52:25.143 --> 52:28.177
Costco?
Like, the warehouse place?

52:28.179 --> 52:29.578
- Yes!
- That is amazing.

52:29.580 --> 52:31.380
Are you guys talking shit
about me again?

52:31.382 --> 52:33.616
No. We're talking about
your proposal to me.

52:33.618 --> 52:35.384
Yeah. Uh, Costco, Brett?

52:35.386 --> 52:36.719
Hell yeah, Costco.

52:36.721 --> 52:37.786
Real romantic, dude.

52:37.788 --> 52:39.488
Who gives a fuck?

52:39.490 --> 52:41.924
When did we all decide
that this was necessary?

52:41.926 --> 52:43.826
I mean, I love Dave and Julia,

52:43.828 --> 52:47.396
but why did we all have to fly
the fuck out to Hawaii for this?

52:47.398 --> 52:49.498
I mean, it's ver--
It's nice here.

52:49.500 --> 52:51.267
- It's nice.
- No, but Brett has a point.

52:51.269 --> 52:54.303
This is way less special
than a-a grocery... emporium?

52:54.305 --> 52:56.939
- What do you call Costco?
- Oh, my God. I-- Who cares?

52:56.941 --> 53:00.676
Straight people
o-ver-think-ing it.

53:00.678 --> 53:02.711
Yes. That's true.
That's true.

53:02.713 --> 53:04.914
- Especially... this little man.
- That one.

53:04.916 --> 53:07.383
Oh, he's the worst of the worst.
Wait.

53:07.385 --> 53:10.252
- Nick, remember, uh, Sally Klum?
- Klumshot.

53:10.254 --> 53:11.687
- Klumshot?
- We're not telling this story.

53:11.689 --> 53:13.322
No, we <i> are</i> telling this story.

53:13.324 --> 53:14.757
It's a Ben King classic.
We have to tell it.

53:14.759 --> 53:17.226
- There was this girl Sally Klum.
- Klumshot.

53:17.228 --> 53:18.861
Nick called her Klumshot
for no reason.

53:18.863 --> 53:20.296
- 'Cause it's funny.
- It <i> is</i> funny.

53:20.298 --> 53:22.531
Anyway, she was wonderful.
So fun.

53:22.533 --> 53:25.334
And then Ben dumped her
after three weeks because,

53:25.336 --> 53:27.703
and I quote,
he couldn't make her laugh.

53:27.705 --> 53:29.505
"She wasn't responding
to my humor."

53:29.507 --> 53:30.706
Wow.

53:30.708 --> 53:32.608
I don't have
a tiny little mouth.

53:32.610 --> 53:34.677
It's the only way
I can do your voice.

53:34.679 --> 53:36.312
Like I talk like this.

53:36.314 --> 53:37.479
"She wasn't engaging with my..."

53:37.481 --> 53:39.215
- "Err! Err!"
- Guys. Okay, okay.

53:39.217 --> 53:40.616
- Hold on.
- "No one makes me laugh."

53:40.618 --> 53:41.650
- That's kind of close.
- Yeah.

53:41.652 --> 53:42.985
Can I clarify?

53:42.987 --> 53:44.853
She didn't have
a sense of humor.

53:44.855 --> 53:47.523
We couldn't laugh together.

53:47.525 --> 53:48.991
Straight people...

53:48.993 --> 53:50.626
- ...o-ver-think-ing it.
- ...o-ver-think-ing it.

53:50.628 --> 53:51.860
You're doing it now?

53:51.862 --> 53:53.429
Yeah.
I'm part of them now.

53:53.431 --> 53:55.231
- O-ver-think-ing it.
- O-ver-think-ing it.

53:55.233 --> 53:56.799
I love her.
She's great.

53:56.801 --> 53:59.468
So, like, what is this?
What's going on with you two?

53:59.470 --> 54:01.270
- What?
- What -- What about us?

54:01.272 --> 54:02.805
You have ridiculous vibes
coming off of you,

54:02.807 --> 54:04.406
and you're acting weird
about it.

54:04.408 --> 54:05.741
Don't -- Don't do this.

54:05.743 --> 54:06.976
- Do what?
- I'm sorry. What?

54:06.978 --> 54:08.244
- What are we doing?
- Do what?

54:08.246 --> 54:09.478
Yeah.

54:09.480 --> 54:11.380
We're -- We're friends.
That's it.

54:13.451 --> 54:14.483
What?

54:14.485 --> 54:16.018
- Y-You've fucked.
- You fucked?

54:16.020 --> 54:17.653
- Oh, right here?
- They fucked.

54:17.655 --> 54:18.988
They fucked.

54:18.990 --> 54:20.589
- They really, really fucked.
- Oh, my God.

54:20.591 --> 54:21.991
They fucked.
They really, really fucked.

54:21.993 --> 54:23.559
Hey, they fucked.

54:25.496 --> 54:28.664
- It's so nice here.
- I know.

54:28.666 --> 54:30.266
I think we can safely say

54:30.268 --> 54:31.900
that my friends' weddings
are better than yours.

54:31.902 --> 54:34.336
You know,
it's not a competition, Ben.

54:37.675 --> 54:39.642
- Yeah.
- Everything okay?

54:39.644 --> 54:41.877
Yeah, yeah.
Just my dad.

54:41.879 --> 54:43.946
Are you still mad at him?

54:43.948 --> 54:46.048
I'm not mad. I just...
I don't know.

54:46.050 --> 54:49.518
I-I don't know what to tell him
about this best-man thing.

54:49.520 --> 54:52.421
Why don't you just be like,
"Yeah, Dad. Sounds great.

54:52.423 --> 54:53.455
Let's hug now"?

54:53.457 --> 54:55.457
Okay.

54:57.628 --> 54:59.428
Uh, hey.

54:59.430 --> 55:04.533
So I have been thinking a lot
about the last wedding.

55:05.836 --> 55:09.738
You know, what, um...
what ha-- what happened.

55:09.740 --> 55:13.776
And, um, you know,
like, the, uh, the activities

55:13.778 --> 55:16.312
that we engaged in and --

55:16.314 --> 55:18.714
Okay.

55:18.716 --> 55:19.782
- What?
- No.

55:19.784 --> 55:21.383
I'm sorry.
I...

55:21.385 --> 55:22.751
- What?
- I -- No.

55:22.753 --> 55:26.889
I-I have been thinking a lot
about it, too.

55:29.794 --> 55:31.994
In a good way?

55:31.996 --> 55:34.396
Yes.

55:35.499 --> 55:37.900
You too -- in a good way?

55:39.704 --> 55:42.037
- Ben! You?
- Yeah.

55:43.874 --> 55:45.741
Okay.

55:45.743 --> 55:47.776
- All right.
- All right.

55:50.648 --> 55:52.981
Oh, I missed you.

55:52.983 --> 55:54.783
Did you?

55:54.785 --> 55:56.985
Wait, wait.
Why haven't we hung out?

55:56.987 --> 55:59.121
- You didn't ask me.
- You didn't ask <i> me.</i>

55:59.123 --> 56:00.923
- I told you I was busy.
- No, you weren't.

56:00.925 --> 56:02.391
- What?
- You were scared.

56:02.393 --> 56:04.993
Yeah, you were,
you scared little bitch.

56:04.995 --> 56:06.795
- What is this outfit?
- It's a romper.

56:06.797 --> 56:08.564
- How does it work?
- Get -- Just get it off!

56:08.566 --> 56:10.699
- Tell me where!
- Get it off!

56:15.373 --> 56:17.573
- Hey, Alice.
- What?

56:17.575 --> 56:20.376
- I don't want to alarm you...
- What?

56:20.378 --> 56:22.711
- ...but I think I'm a robe guy.
- Oh, wow.

56:22.713 --> 56:25.781
Can't believe that fits
your lanky body.

56:25.783 --> 56:27.516
I mean, it only kind of does,

56:27.518 --> 56:29.718
but I feel like I'm showing
just enough leg.

56:29.720 --> 56:31.420
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Right?

56:31.422 --> 56:33.455
And the rest is just breezy,
and I feel beautiful.

56:33.457 --> 56:35.791
Okay, but, um,
are you gonna get dressed?

56:35.793 --> 56:37.526
'Cause it's in 15 minutes.

56:37.528 --> 56:38.827
Oh, no, no, no.
This is me now.

56:38.829 --> 56:40.696
- This is me for all time.
- Forever?

56:40.698 --> 56:42.131
- Okay. I like it.
- Oh, you like it?

56:42.133 --> 56:44.032
- Yeah.
- That's good.

56:44.034 --> 56:45.801
- Hey.
- Hi.

56:46.504 --> 56:47.803
You know, everyone has a point.

56:47.805 --> 56:49.705
I don't think we look bad
together.

56:49.707 --> 56:51.607
Oh, it's everyone
that thinks that?

56:51.609 --> 56:52.941
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

56:52.943 --> 56:54.610
I mean, they say it to me a lot.

56:54.612 --> 56:56.712
- Don't you get the same thing?
- No.

56:56.714 --> 56:59.047
I mostly get,
"Why do you spend so much time

56:59.049 --> 57:01.150
with that Radio Shack employee?"

57:01.152 --> 57:03.519
Radio Shack is --
is not a thing anymore.

57:03.521 --> 57:05.554
Well, it still looks
like you work there.

57:05.556 --> 57:07.756
- That makes it sadder, you know?
- Mm. Yeah.

57:07.758 --> 57:09.825
Okay.
I see it.

57:15.666 --> 57:18.033
Hey, what if we stayed
for longer?

57:18.035 --> 57:20.035
- Really?
- Yeah.

57:20.037 --> 57:23.806
You know, just, uh,
just a day or two.

57:24.809 --> 57:26.842
Seriously?

57:26.844 --> 57:28.744
Yeah.

57:28.746 --> 57:30.179
Okay.

57:30.181 --> 57:33.048
Yeah. Yeah, I could get down
with that.

57:33.951 --> 57:35.651
- You could?
- I could.

57:35.653 --> 57:36.552
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

57:36.554 --> 57:38.020
- Really?
- Yes!

57:38.022 --> 57:39.588
Well, then I'll change
our reservation.

57:39.590 --> 57:41.156
- Okay! Boom-shakalaka!
- No.

57:41.158 --> 57:42.791
- What?
- No.

57:42.793 --> 57:44.059
We put boom-shakalaka away,
remember?

57:44.061 --> 57:46.228
No, you said only
on special occasions,

57:46.230 --> 57:48.063
and this is
pretty fucking special.

57:48.065 --> 57:50.499
I-I don't know if it qualifies.

57:50.501 --> 57:52.534
Boom-shakalaka, baby!

58:04.615 --> 58:05.914
Do you guys want to get
a picture?

58:05.916 --> 58:07.516
- Do you have one yet?
- No.

58:07.518 --> 58:09.218
- We have -- We have a few.
- We have pictures.

58:09.220 --> 58:11.787
- You don't have them with this.
- You don't have that background.

58:11.789 --> 58:13.055
Give me your phones.
Don't be weird about it.

58:13.057 --> 58:16.024
- All right. Fine.
- You go up -- There.

58:16.026 --> 58:18.627

So, Lily was always
the better sister.

59:41.879 --> 59:44.713
I mean, she did everything
perfectly.

59:44.715 --> 59:47.983
She got a 4.0 GPA.

59:47.985 --> 59:51.153
Uh, she was the captain
of the soccer team.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.790
She graduated with honors
from Harvard.

59:54.792 --> 59:58.193
And then... she decided
to marry Jordan.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:00.829
Thanks, Dad.

01:00:00.831 --> 01:00:02.631
Um, but yeah. No.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.834
I'm -- I'm very happy that
the two of them are together,

01:00:05.836 --> 01:00:10.339
and if I can just give one word
or two words of advice,

01:00:10.341 --> 01:00:15.010
uh, to Jordan,
it would be buckle up.

01:00:15.346 --> 01:00:17.245
Yeah.
And -- Yeah.

01:00:17.247 --> 01:00:19.982
Thanks, guy--
That's the end of the speech.

01:00:21.652 --> 01:00:23.251
Well, it's about damn time.

01:00:23.253 --> 01:00:25.287
- That's what I say.
- Okay. Relax, Mom.

01:00:25.289 --> 01:00:27.889
You guys have known each other
what, 10 years?

01:00:27.891 --> 01:00:29.858
But it's not like we were
hanging out the entire time.

01:00:29.860 --> 01:00:32.227
But Lily and Jordan just met
two years ago,

01:00:32.229 --> 01:00:33.695
and they're getting married
tomorrow.

01:00:33.697 --> 01:00:34.830
Mom, leave me out of it.

01:00:34.832 --> 01:00:37.065
Well, come on.
Ben, I get it.

01:00:37.067 --> 01:00:39.034
You were probably heartbroken
when she was with Nate.

01:00:39.036 --> 01:00:40.702
Mom, God!

01:00:40.704 --> 01:00:42.237
- I bet you hated Nate.
- I didn't really know him.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:45.374
Hey, hon, how much longer
before the potatoes are ready?

01:00:45.376 --> 01:00:46.842
They're done.
Why?

01:00:46.844 --> 01:00:48.210
I'm just trying to gauge
how much longer

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.978
before I put the branzino
on the grill.

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:51.813
Fifteen minutes ago!

01:00:51.815 --> 01:00:54.983
- Whoops. Sorry. I got it.
- Oh, it never gets any easier.

01:00:54.985 --> 01:00:56.752
So what's the problem?

01:00:56.754 --> 01:00:58.387
Are you afraid
of strong women?

01:00:58.389 --> 01:01:01.156
What? No. No. N-No.
I-I love strong women.

01:01:01.158 --> 01:01:02.758
Okay.
So what took you so long?

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.292
- Well, I --
- You don't have to answer that.

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.894
- I can answer that.
- No.

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.229
You have to stop asking
so many questions --

01:01:07.231 --> 01:01:09.031
Because you're asking
so many questions!

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.365
- Stop!
- Let him answer it!

01:01:10.367 --> 01:01:11.400
So?

01:01:11.402 --> 01:01:12.801
We were just friends.

01:01:12.803 --> 01:01:14.770
Friends?
Friends grow on trees.

01:01:14.772 --> 01:01:17.172
But let me tell you what doesn't
grow on trees. Wives.

01:01:17.174 --> 01:01:18.974
Now, this fine piece
right here --

01:01:18.976 --> 01:01:20.442
Mom, don't find me
a fine piece.

01:01:20.444 --> 01:01:21.810
- What?
- That's weird.

01:01:21.812 --> 01:01:23.145
You're my daughter.

01:01:23.147 --> 01:01:24.980
It's okay if I think
you're a fine slice.

01:01:24.982 --> 01:01:26.948
Look.
He obviously agrees.

01:01:26.950 --> 01:01:28.383
Or he wouldn't be
throwing it into you.

01:01:28.385 --> 01:01:29.985
- Okay! That's enough.
- Right?

01:01:29.987 --> 01:01:32.187
Ben, go see if my dad needs help
with the grill.

01:01:32.189 --> 01:01:34.156
- Yep.
- Great.

01:01:34.158 --> 01:01:36.058
It's crazy.
You two have nothing in common.

01:01:36.060 --> 01:01:38.060
Fuck off.

01:01:38.062 --> 01:01:40.128
- Hey, Mr. Mori.
- Hey. How's it going?

01:01:40.130 --> 01:01:41.430
Doing good.
You need any help?

01:01:41.432 --> 01:01:43.098
Um...

01:01:44.001 --> 01:01:46.034
...no.

01:01:47.905 --> 01:01:49.404
I didn't know you were in band.

01:01:49.406 --> 01:01:51.940
Hell yeah. Clarinet.

01:01:51.942 --> 01:01:54.409
Third chair, baby.

01:01:54.411 --> 01:01:57.179
Hey, this Jonathan Weiss kid
had a crush on you.

01:01:57.181 --> 01:01:58.480
How do you know that?

01:01:58.482 --> 01:02:00.849
'Cause you wrote,
"He has a crush on me."

01:02:00.851 --> 01:02:04.152
Oh, Jesus.

01:02:06.423 --> 01:02:10.225
Hey.
You ready for ultimate hotness?

01:02:10.227 --> 01:02:11.827
What?

01:02:14.765 --> 01:02:16.298
Sexy, sexy.

01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:18.400
Oh, yes.

01:02:18.402 --> 01:02:21.369
This is the full seventh-grade
Alice experience.

01:02:21.371 --> 01:02:23.772
Yes, it is, young man.

01:02:23.774 --> 01:02:24.773
Oh, my God.

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:26.775
I've never done this before.

01:02:26.777 --> 01:02:29.010
- Mm.
- Mm.

01:02:29.012 --> 01:02:30.512
Mm.

01:02:30.514 --> 01:02:32.347
Mm.
You got to...

01:02:32.349 --> 01:02:33.749
- What?
- You got to take it out.

01:02:33.751 --> 01:02:35.350
- Is it too much?
- I can feel it.

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:39.821
Hey, um, Nate texted you.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:42.858
- Like, just now?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.861 --> 01:02:46.194
Do you want to --
Do you want to check it or...

01:02:46.196 --> 01:02:48.396
No.
I'm good.

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:50.165
Really?

01:02:50.167 --> 01:02:51.399
Yeah.

01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:53.502
- Check it.
- You <i> want</i> me to check it?

01:02:53.504 --> 01:02:56.238
No.
I mean, you can. I would.

01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:58.440
No. I know what it says.
I don't need to check that.

01:02:58.442 --> 01:02:59.941
What does it say?

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.310
Probably like...
"Oh, Alice.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:03.779
I miss you.

01:03:03.781 --> 01:03:07.115
I made a mistake."

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:09.084
That doesn't mess with you,
like, at all?

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:12.420
No, dude.
I'm with you.

01:03:13.023 --> 01:03:15.791
You know.
I'm with <i> you.</i>

01:03:15.793 --> 01:03:16.992
- Mm.
- This guy.

01:03:16.994 --> 01:03:20.128
Mm.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:23.098
Mm.

01:03:26.336 --> 01:03:29.504
Uh... w-wait.
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

01:03:29.506 --> 01:03:31.206
- I think...
- What?

01:03:31.208 --> 01:03:35.210
Maybe we wait till we're
back home to do this.

01:03:37.181 --> 01:03:39.347
- Are you being serious?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:43.251
I don't want your mom to come in
and, like, bop me on the head.

01:03:43.253 --> 01:03:44.886
Bop you?

01:03:44.888 --> 01:03:46.521
Yeah.
Bop me.

01:03:47.257 --> 01:03:48.957
Um, cool.

01:03:48.959 --> 01:03:50.058
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:03:50.060 --> 01:03:51.860
- No. It's fine.
- No, I...

01:03:51.862 --> 01:03:54.429
I just figured maybe the walls
are kind of thin,

01:03:54.431 --> 01:03:55.864
maybe your parents can hear us.

01:03:55.866 --> 01:03:57.532
I mean, they can't, but yeah.

01:03:57.534 --> 01:04:01.102
It's okay.
We have to wake up early anyway.

01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:04.873
Hey, you know what we're
gonna do when we get back home?

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:05.874
What?

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:08.343
Just sex.

01:04:08.345 --> 01:04:10.912
Just hardcore fucking.

01:04:10.914 --> 01:04:13.048
Okay.

01:04:13.050 --> 01:04:15.517
Go to bed.

01:04:17.487 --> 01:04:19.921
Hey, I'm totally cool
if you want to check that text.

01:04:19.923 --> 01:04:21.990
Oh, my God. Shut up.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:23.358
Where are the caterers?!

01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.261
They were supposed to be here
an hour ago!

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:29.497
Dolores, please put down
those flowers.

01:04:29.499 --> 01:04:31.366
Mitchell,
why aren't you dressed?

01:04:31.368 --> 01:04:33.368
I need a little help
with the collage.

01:04:33.370 --> 01:04:35.904
- It's taking forever.
- Are you kidding?

01:04:35.906 --> 01:04:38.139
- Oh, my God!
- Uh, I can help.

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:40.308
Go! Go! Go!

01:04:40.310 --> 01:04:42.010
I hope you're better
with a glue stick

01:04:42.012 --> 01:04:43.511
than you are with a helium tank.

01:04:43.513 --> 01:04:45.146
Hey, Mr. Mori,
How's it going?

01:04:45.148 --> 01:04:46.915
- What -- What can I do?
- Uh, we're collaging.

01:04:46.917 --> 01:04:48.917
Start with that pile.
Cut around heads.

01:04:48.919 --> 01:04:50.252
- Okay.
- Leave the ears, though.

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:51.353
Yeah.

01:04:53.090 --> 01:04:54.489
What am I supposed to do
with this?

01:04:54.491 --> 01:04:57.025
Just zhush.

01:04:57.027 --> 01:04:58.526
What is zhushing?

01:04:58.528 --> 01:04:59.961
It's, like, something.

01:04:59.963 --> 01:05:00.996
- Like that?
- Yeah.

01:05:00.998 --> 01:05:02.564
Okay.

01:05:03.500 --> 01:05:05.433
Are you nervous?

01:05:06.103 --> 01:05:07.235
No.

01:05:09.573 --> 01:05:11.339
Are you jealous?

01:05:12.509 --> 01:05:15.210
Jesus Christ.

01:05:15.212 --> 01:05:17.045
You are a monster in this dress.

01:05:17.047 --> 01:05:19.047
Hey, you're not allowed
to say mean things.

01:05:19.049 --> 01:05:21.182
I'm just kidding.
I am. I love you.

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:23.118
I love you.

01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:25.620
I can't believe you made me wear
this stupid dress.

01:05:28.258 --> 01:05:30.125
You look pretty.

01:05:30.127 --> 01:05:32.193
Okay.

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:36.932
You can put that one, uh,

01:05:36.934 --> 01:05:38.967
next to the engagement picture
right there.

01:05:38.969 --> 01:05:40.669
No problem.

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.606
Oh, my God.

01:05:47.644 --> 01:05:49.311
- Is this Alice?
- Ah. Yeah.

01:05:49.313 --> 01:05:50.445
Oh.
Look at that hat.

01:05:50.447 --> 01:05:52.614
I know.
Isn't she cute?

01:05:57.721 --> 01:06:00.522
Whoops. I don't know
how Nate got in there.

01:06:00.524 --> 01:06:02.257
Probably should have
thrown that one out.

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:03.258
I'm sorry.

01:06:03.260 --> 01:06:04.626
Oh, no.
Hey, it happens.

01:06:04.628 --> 01:06:06.227
- Yeah.
- Right?

01:06:08.465 --> 01:06:11.132
I'm really glad
you came along, Ben.

01:06:12.369 --> 01:06:15.737
Haven't seen my daughter
this happy in a long time.

01:06:21.678 --> 01:06:23.611
Everybody's moving so slowly.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.413
- Come on.
- Dad.

01:06:26.483 --> 01:06:28.350
- Oh.
- This is not good here.

01:06:28.352 --> 01:06:30.085
Why aren't the flowers
already here?

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:31.753
- For God's sakes.
- It's okay.

01:06:31.755 --> 01:06:34.990
It's all right. It's beautiful.
You've done an amazing job.

01:06:34.992 --> 01:06:36.591
I love you.
Okay. I love you, too.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:38.493
All right.

01:06:38.495 --> 01:06:40.428
Okay.
Go to work.

01:06:40.430 --> 01:06:42.097
Hi!

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.032
Oh, my God.
How are you?

01:06:44.034 --> 01:06:45.567
Hi. Ben.

01:06:45.569 --> 01:06:47.035
- Ben.
- This is Ben. Sorry.

01:06:47.037 --> 01:06:48.470
I didn't introduce you.
This is Darlene.

01:06:48.472 --> 01:06:50.305
How's it going?
Nice to meet you. Ben.

01:06:50.307 --> 01:06:51.706
Look at you. Oh.

01:06:51.708 --> 01:06:53.208
Hello.

01:06:53.210 --> 01:06:56.578
- Thanks, Uncle Peter.
- Thank you, Uncle Peter.

01:06:56.580 --> 01:06:58.013
Ben. Ben.

01:06:58.015 --> 01:06:59.447
The assistant grill master.
Come on.

01:06:59.449 --> 01:07:00.715
No, no, no, no, no.
It's okay.

01:07:00.717 --> 01:07:02.417
It's fine.
Just come into the shot.

01:07:02.419 --> 01:07:04.252
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Now I need to recheck the --

01:07:04.254 --> 01:07:06.554
- All right. All right.
- I need to look.

01:07:06.556 --> 01:07:08.156
How tall are you?
You're too tall.

01:07:08.158 --> 01:07:09.190
- Six foot.
- Stand in back.

01:07:09.192 --> 01:07:10.191
- Okay.
- Right here.

01:07:10.193 --> 01:07:11.593
- Here?
- Yes. Perfect.

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:13.561
Okay.
Ready.

01:07:13.563 --> 01:07:18.400
So, um, to wrap it all up,
uh, Jordan, don't get drunk

01:07:18.402 --> 01:07:21.369
because, um, you're gonna
have to perform tonight, right?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:28.610
Thanks to Kit and Kate
for the wonderful flowers.

01:07:28.612 --> 01:07:30.045
They were amazing.

01:07:30.047 --> 01:07:32.414
And, um, a round of applause
for Ben,

01:07:32.416 --> 01:07:34.716
Alice's new boyfriend.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:36.751
We like him 'cause he's cute.

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:38.420
Okay. No.

01:07:38.422 --> 01:07:40.088
- Yeah, Ben.
- Thank you.

01:07:40.090 --> 01:07:42.557
So, uh, you know,
enjoy the food.

01:07:42.559 --> 01:07:44.626
Celebrate.
Congratulations, Lily.

01:07:44.628 --> 01:07:46.161
Okay. Okay. That's...

01:07:46.163 --> 01:07:49.764
- Yeah, Mom, yeah.
- Whoo!

01:07:51.268 --> 01:07:53.334
- She -- She's on fire tonight.
- She is freaking...

01:07:53.336 --> 01:07:55.070
- She's killing it.
- ...a bullet.

01:07:55.072 --> 01:07:57.105
- Wow.
- Um, are you doing okay?

01:07:57.107 --> 01:07:58.840
Yeah. Yeah.
No, I'm good.

01:07:58.842 --> 01:08:00.308
Okay.

01:08:00.310 --> 01:08:03.311
It's more than you could have
possibly imagined, right?

01:08:03.313 --> 01:08:05.346
No, no, no. No, no.
It's great.

01:08:05.348 --> 01:08:06.714
- Alice.
- All right.

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:08.149
- Get over here.
- Okay.

01:08:08.151 --> 01:08:10.185
- Say hi to your cousins.
- Okay!

01:08:10.187 --> 01:08:11.853
- You're doing great.
- Oh.

01:08:12.756 --> 01:08:14.422
Hurry.

01:08:14.424 --> 01:08:15.757
I'm coming.

01:08:22.765 --> 01:08:26.301
As Nick's best man, I could
tell you all the stories

01:08:26.303 --> 01:08:28.303
about his past boyfriends.

01:08:28.305 --> 01:08:30.438
And as Brett's best man,
I could tell you

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:32.640
all the stories
about his ex-girlfriends.

01:08:32.642 --> 01:08:34.576
- But we're not gonna do that.
- No, we are not.

01:08:34.578 --> 01:08:36.377
- Mnh-mnh.
- Because we love each other.

01:08:36.379 --> 01:08:39.247
Yes.
And because my ex is here.

01:08:39.249 --> 01:08:40.715
- Hi, Chloe.
- Hi, Brett.

01:08:40.716 --> 01:08:42.550
Oh, don't you talk to him,
bitch!

01:08:50.327 --> 01:08:51.826
Ben, let's go.

01:08:51.828 --> 01:08:53.560
What are you doing?

01:08:53.563 --> 01:08:55.395
Writing a card
for Brett and Nick.

01:08:55.398 --> 01:08:56.831
Okay.

01:08:57.868 --> 01:08:59.533
Ohh.

01:09:00.670 --> 01:09:03.238
Oh, God, what are these pillows?

01:09:03.240 --> 01:09:04.639
I think it was a gift.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.307
Okay, I'm gonna
buy you new ones.

01:09:06.309 --> 01:09:08.209
- You don't have to do that.
- Yes, I do.

01:09:08.211 --> 01:09:10.444
- They're burning my eyes.
- Well, I like them.

01:09:10.447 --> 01:09:12.279
How much longer?

01:09:12.282 --> 01:09:16.283
Love, Alice and Ben.
There we go.

01:09:16.286 --> 01:09:17.519
All right.

01:09:17.520 --> 01:09:18.819
Okay. You ready?

01:09:18.822 --> 01:09:20.522
Yeah. Been ready.

01:09:20.524 --> 01:09:23.457
Do you have the gift
in your car?

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:28.529
- Oh.
- Alice.

01:09:28.532 --> 01:09:29.564
- I'm so sorry.
- Seriously?

01:09:29.566 --> 01:09:31.466
I left it at my house.

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:32.767
We can swing by and pick it up.

01:09:32.769 --> 01:09:35.270
No, no.
We don't have time for that.

01:09:35.272 --> 01:09:37.238
Fuck. Okay. Come on. We --
All right, let's go.

01:09:37.240 --> 01:09:38.773
Okay.

01:09:41.411 --> 01:09:43.411
Oh, I hate this.

01:09:43.412 --> 01:09:44.845
I hate showing up empty-handed.

01:09:44.848 --> 01:09:47.482
It's fine. I promise you
they don't give a shit.

01:09:47.484 --> 01:09:49.250
I give a shit.

01:09:49.252 --> 01:09:51.685
Hand-delivering a gift.
It's a -- It's a classic move.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:53.587
Okay, well, I never give a gift.

01:09:53.590 --> 01:09:55.690
You never give a gift?
What does that mean?

01:09:55.692 --> 01:09:58.693
No. They should give me a gift
for coming to this shit.

01:09:58.695 --> 01:10:00.595
- Do you hear yourself right now?
- Yeah.

01:10:00.597 --> 01:10:01.863
That's the most selfish thing
I've ever heard

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:04.199
in my entire life --
my entire life.

01:10:04.201 --> 01:10:05.466
Shouldn't it be refrigerated?

01:10:05.468 --> 01:10:06.768
No, we're already going
to the roof.

01:10:06.770 --> 01:10:08.503
Oh. Are you friends
of Brett and Nick?

01:10:08.505 --> 01:10:10.338
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.973
Uh, I'm Ben.
This is Alice.

01:10:11.975 --> 01:10:14.576
I can introduce myself.
I'm Alice. This is Ben.

01:10:14.578 --> 01:10:16.644
Oh. Pleased to meet you guys.
I'm Jackie.

01:10:16.646 --> 01:10:18.713
- Greg.
- We're the downstairs neighbors.

01:10:18.715 --> 01:10:20.548
You guys know if there's gonna
be food at this thing?

01:10:20.550 --> 01:10:21.950
I already told you
that there isn't food.

01:10:21.952 --> 01:10:23.418
- I don't know.
- Never been wrong.

01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.686
Never, ever been wrong
in your life?

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:26.888
See? They have a gift.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.323
Okay. You know what?

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:29.757
Can you just --
Can you let it go?

01:10:29.759 --> 01:10:30.925
I really don't want to go
through the whole party

01:10:30.927 --> 01:10:31.859
in a fight.

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:33.728
I'm not doing anything.

01:10:33.730 --> 01:10:35.763
You're being a little shitty.

01:10:35.765 --> 01:10:36.864
Don't do that.

01:10:36.866 --> 01:10:38.433
- Do what?
- Don't do that.

01:10:38.435 --> 01:10:39.901
Don't make me feel crazy
because you messed up.

01:10:39.903 --> 01:10:42.804
I'm not. I literally
left a present at home.

01:10:42.806 --> 01:10:44.806
It should not be
this big of a deal.

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:46.674
Are you kidding me?
It's a big deal.

01:10:46.676 --> 01:10:48.543
I asked you to pick it up
like, what, three times?

01:10:48.545 --> 01:10:51.613
Who cares that you're
literally the only person

01:10:51.615 --> 01:10:53.815
who doesn't use
gift registration.

01:10:53.817 --> 01:10:55.483
Yeah, that's what's special

01:10:55.485 --> 01:10:56.985
about actually
hand-delivering a gift.

01:10:56.987 --> 01:10:58.486
You get to see their reaction.

01:10:58.488 --> 01:10:59.654
You get to see the joy.
It's amazing.

01:10:59.656 --> 01:11:00.788
Well, we got them a Keurig.

01:11:00.790 --> 01:11:01.889
I don't think the two of them

01:11:01.891 --> 01:11:03.458
will exactly come
with enthusiasm.

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.692
Well, we're never gonna
know now, are we?

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:07.562
- Okay. Hey!
- Hi.

01:11:07.564 --> 01:11:10.298
Oh, my God.
Hi, buddy.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:13.434
Hey, congratulations, dude.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:15.670
You guys, I am so sorry
we don't come bearing gifts.

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:16.871
Bozo here left it at home.

01:11:16.873 --> 01:11:18.806
- Seriously?
- I'm joking.

01:11:18.808 --> 01:11:20.675
I'm joking! It was me.

01:11:20.677 --> 01:11:22.410
I'm the monster
who left your Keurig at home.

01:11:22.412 --> 01:11:23.845
- I'm sorry.
- A Keurig?

01:11:23.847 --> 01:11:25.446
It's a little coffee thing
with the pods.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:26.781
Oh! Nice!

01:11:26.783 --> 01:11:28.416
It's nice.
Thank you so much.

01:11:28.418 --> 01:11:29.917
Yeah. See, you get to see
the excitement.

01:11:29.919 --> 01:11:31.586
Yeah, yeah.
Well, you blew the surprise.

01:11:31.588 --> 01:11:34.355
Okay? She blew the surprise.
I'm sorry.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:35.823
Well, for the record,
I don't give a shit

01:11:35.825 --> 01:11:36.824
that you left it at home.

01:11:36.826 --> 01:11:38.026
Okay, well, forget it.

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:39.694
Congratulations, you guys.

01:11:39.696 --> 01:11:42.297
- Oh.
- I'm so happy to see you.

01:11:42.299 --> 01:11:43.765
- Let's get shitfaced. Yeah?
- Please, yes.

01:11:43.767 --> 01:11:46.401
Please, please, please.

01:11:56.646 --> 01:11:58.746
Okay.
So they ran out of beer,

01:11:58.748 --> 01:12:01.983
so I had to settle for whatever
was in the plastic jug.

01:12:01.985 --> 01:12:03.651
Oh.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:06.521
Ugh. That's awful.

01:12:06.523 --> 01:12:08.423
- Will you hold this?
- Yeah.

01:12:10.026 --> 01:12:11.826
Hey, for Jacob
and Anna's wedding,

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:13.461
I was thinking
that we just do the same thing

01:12:13.463 --> 01:12:14.662
that we did at the beach

01:12:14.664 --> 01:12:16.597
and stick around
a couple extra days.

01:12:16.599 --> 01:12:19.033
Um, yeah. I --
I don't know.

01:12:19.035 --> 01:12:20.635
I-I don't know if I can make it
to that one.

01:12:20.637 --> 01:12:22.437
What? Why?

01:12:22.439 --> 01:12:24.439
I just -- I have a thing.

01:12:24.441 --> 01:12:26.441
- A thing.
- Yeah. It's a work thing.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:28.976
- I can't move it.
- No. You're not making me go

01:12:28.978 --> 01:12:31.379
to Jacob Cartelli's wedding
by myself.

01:12:31.381 --> 01:12:32.980
I'm...

01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.682
pretty sure you can handle it.

01:12:34.684 --> 01:12:36.784
Ben, you're coming
to the wedding.

01:12:36.786 --> 01:12:38.920
You don't get to just bail
'cause you're in a mood.

01:12:38.922 --> 01:12:41.022
- I'm not in a mood.
- Yes, you are.

01:12:41.024 --> 01:12:42.924
You're in a little bitch mood
'cause of the coffeemaker.

01:12:42.926 --> 01:12:44.859
It's not the coffeemaker!

01:12:50.934 --> 01:12:52.934
Sorry. I just --
I-I need a second.

01:13:03.947 --> 01:13:06.080
There you are.

01:13:06.082 --> 01:13:07.382
Jesus.

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:09.917
Hey.

01:13:09.919 --> 01:13:11.652
Are you smoking?

01:13:11.654 --> 01:13:13.988
Yeah.
Bummed it off of somebody.

01:13:14.724 --> 01:13:16.958
You look like a fucking idiot
smoking that thing.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.559
Yeah.

01:13:20.497 --> 01:13:21.963
What's going on with you?

01:13:22.632 --> 01:13:24.532
Nothing.
I'm just thinking.

01:13:25.668 --> 01:13:27.001
About?

01:13:27.003 --> 01:13:28.136
I don't know.
Stuff.

01:13:28.138 --> 01:13:29.570
Oh. Stuff. Okay.

01:13:29.572 --> 01:13:30.838
In that case, I'll leave you be.

01:13:30.840 --> 01:13:33.040
Hey. Stop. Talk to me.

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:35.810
I just -- I don't --

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:38.179
I've been thinking
about us, you know?

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.647
About what this is.

01:13:39.649 --> 01:13:41.149
We were dating.

01:13:41.151 --> 01:13:42.683
It's not a huge fucking mystery.

01:13:42.685 --> 01:13:45.153
It's not weird to you,

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:47.155
you know, that we're all of
a sudden, like, this couple?

01:13:47.157 --> 01:13:48.923
No.

01:13:48.925 --> 01:13:50.158
Ben, this isn't sudden.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.627
We've been doing this
for a while.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:54.962
I mean, Jesus, you came
to my sister's wedding with me.

01:13:54.964 --> 01:13:57.498
Yeah. Yeah. Because that's --
that was the deal.

01:13:57.500 --> 01:13:59.434
That's what we do.

01:14:00.537 --> 01:14:02.036
Are you fucking serious
right now?

01:14:02.038 --> 01:14:05.907
I just -- I-I never --
I never saw us as -- as a thing.

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:07.608
So? Neither did I.

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.811
Quite frankly, I was repulsed
by the idea of you.

01:14:09.813 --> 01:14:11.012
- Thanks.
- But it changed,

01:14:11.014 --> 01:14:13.548
and it just -- it happened.

01:14:15.151 --> 01:14:19.687
I can just --
I can feel you settling in.

01:14:19.689 --> 01:14:22.056
- And I'm having doubts.
- Okay.

01:14:23.493 --> 01:14:24.826
That's okay.

01:14:24.828 --> 01:14:26.227
I-I mean, you're allowed
to have doubts.

01:14:26.229 --> 01:14:28.663
It's just
I don't think we have...

01:14:29.499 --> 01:14:31.532
...you know, what, like,
Brett and Nick have.

01:14:32.235 --> 01:14:34.869
- What, two dicks?
- No. Just...

01:14:35.872 --> 01:14:37.538
Alice, I look
at some of these couples,

01:14:37.540 --> 01:14:39.640
and they're not like us.

01:14:39.642 --> 01:14:42.577
They just --
They -- They have this...

01:14:42.579 --> 01:14:44.545
- this...
- Love?

01:14:44.547 --> 01:14:45.580
Yeah.

01:14:45.582 --> 01:14:47.615
Yeah, well, I love you, dumbass.

01:14:55.091 --> 01:14:56.624
Do you love me?

01:14:56.626 --> 01:14:57.892
Uh...

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:00.695
I don't know.

01:15:06.503 --> 01:15:08.202
- So that's a no.
- It's an I don't know.

01:15:08.204 --> 01:15:09.904
- Okay.
- Alice, I just need to be...

01:15:09.906 --> 01:15:11.506
- That's fucking great.
- ...100% certain with you.

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:12.807
And I'm not.
I'm not right now.

01:15:12.809 --> 01:15:13.774
Oh, my God.

01:15:13.776 --> 01:15:15.576
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:15:15.578 --> 01:15:17.078
I-I-I should have stopped this
a long time ago.

01:15:17.080 --> 01:15:19.814
Ben, don't do this.
Stop, stop doing this.

01:15:19.816 --> 01:15:22.016
I'm serious.
We have a good thing, okay?

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:24.552
I-I'm not -- I'm not asking you
to marry me.

01:15:24.554 --> 01:15:26.554
I'm not asking you to move in.

01:15:26.556 --> 01:15:29.190
I mean, what?
What do you need? What --

01:15:29.192 --> 01:15:31.526
This is good. You just
have to give it a chance.

01:15:31.528 --> 01:15:33.794
- Just -- Just try it for me.
- I can't. I can't.

01:15:33.796 --> 01:15:36.063
- Why can't --
- I can't just say "Fuck it"

01:15:36.065 --> 01:15:37.832
and then hurt you
the way that Nate did.

01:15:37.834 --> 01:15:40.067
I'm sorry, but that would
kill me if I did that to you.

01:15:40.069 --> 01:15:42.069
Don't say that to me.

01:15:42.071 --> 01:15:47.174
You are hurting me way more
than Nate ever hurt me.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:50.845
God, Ben, you talk
about how you want love.

01:15:50.847 --> 01:15:53.681
You're always looking for love,
and I'm here.

01:15:53.683 --> 01:15:56.617
It's standing right in front
of you, and you can't --

01:16:00.023 --> 01:16:02.156
- Alice, I'm so sorry.
- Don't --

01:16:02.158 --> 01:16:05.660
Don't fucking say you're sorry.

01:16:05.662 --> 01:16:07.628
You are not sorry, Ben.

01:16:07.630 --> 01:16:10.998
You think you're this good guy,
and you're not.

01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.767
You are not.

01:16:14.771 --> 01:16:16.571
- You're a fucking asshole.
- Alice.

01:16:16.573 --> 01:16:19.674
I don't fucking give a shit.
Honestly.

01:16:19.676 --> 01:16:21.008
I'm cool.

01:16:34.958 --> 01:16:38.359
Before the wedding, I sat down
with Josh and Allison

01:16:38.361 --> 01:16:41.596
and had them each tell me what
they thought about one another,

01:16:41.598 --> 01:16:43.598
what makes up their love,

01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:47.268
what makes them soul mates
and there for one another.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:50.371
I am always very impressed
with your love.

01:16:50.373 --> 01:16:53.140
You may now kiss the bride.

01:16:53.142 --> 01:16:56.711
- Mazel tov!
- Mazel tov!

01:17:03.119 --> 01:17:06.687
The first time
that Allison met Josh,

01:17:06.689 --> 01:17:08.289
she just straight-up farted.

01:17:08.291 --> 01:17:10.992
And then she blamed me for it.

01:17:12.161 --> 01:17:14.128
Didn't you, Allison?

01:17:21.738 --> 01:17:25.172
Yeah, I'm -- I'm a VP
at a start-up.

01:17:25.174 --> 01:17:26.407
That doesn't sound
very interesting.

01:17:26.409 --> 01:17:28.042
It's not. It's not.
That's the thing.

01:17:28.044 --> 01:17:30.378
- Excuse me.
- My God. Hi.

01:17:30.380 --> 01:17:32.013
Oh, my God.
So good to see you.

I'm just dancing.

01:18:39.315 --> 01:18:41.048
No, you're being that idiot
at the wedding.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:43.250

- Being that guy.

I'm having a good time.

01:18:52.929 --> 01:18:54.795
No, you aren't.
That's not fun.

01:18:54.797 --> 01:18:56.063
That did not look
like you're having fun.

01:18:56.065 --> 01:18:57.898
I'm having -- I'm having a ball.

01:18:57.900 --> 01:18:59.400
I'm having a regular
old ball of a time.

01:18:59.402 --> 01:19:00.935
I'm flying solo, buddy.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:02.403
Uh, sure.

01:19:02.405 --> 01:19:03.738
- It's great.
- Where's Alice?

01:19:03.740 --> 01:19:05.005
I mean, I thought you guys

01:19:05.007 --> 01:19:06.273
were doing all these weddings
together.

01:19:06.275 --> 01:19:08.209
We sort of, um...

01:19:08.211 --> 01:19:10.411
W-We sort of imploded.

01:19:13.049 --> 01:19:14.315
I imploded it.

01:19:14.317 --> 01:19:16.183
Mm-hmm. Why?

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:17.852
'Cause, man, I don't know.

01:19:17.854 --> 01:19:20.521
I don't know if I can be
with her, you know, forever.

01:19:20.523 --> 01:19:21.922
Ohh.

01:19:21.924 --> 01:19:22.823
What?

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.460
- You know how you're a dumb guy?
- Yeah.

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:28.863
I think these weddings
are making you dumber.

01:19:30.967 --> 01:19:32.933
Yeah. Maybe.
No more weddings.

01:19:32.935 --> 01:19:34.301
They're bad for me.

01:19:34.303 --> 01:19:36.270
If I get invited to another one,

01:19:36.272 --> 01:19:37.938
I'm gonna be like,
"Hey, no, thank you," okay?

01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:40.040
I can't go.
I can't do it.

01:19:40.042 --> 01:19:42.943
It's just like,
why is everybody so in love

01:19:42.945 --> 01:19:46.213
and just so -- just sure?

01:19:46.215 --> 01:19:47.915
Dude, they're not.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:49.450
What are you talk--
What are you talking about?

01:19:49.452 --> 01:19:51.152
You have never had doubts
about Amanda.

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:52.520
Why would you say that?

01:19:52.522 --> 01:19:54.255
How do you know?

01:19:54.257 --> 01:19:55.923
Do you, like, watch us,
like, all the time?

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:57.091
Do you have a camera
set up in our house?

01:19:57.093 --> 01:19:58.425
Jesus.

01:19:58.427 --> 01:20:00.394
I have doubts about Amanda
all the time.

01:20:00.396 --> 01:20:02.263
We're not perfect.

01:20:02.265 --> 01:20:05.900
Me and Amanda getting married,
we're just going for it.

01:20:05.902 --> 01:20:07.434
We don't know.

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:10.070
So what's the point?

01:20:10.072 --> 01:20:11.071
Because it's fun.

01:20:11.073 --> 01:20:12.239
You know?

01:20:12.241 --> 01:20:14.575
It is.
It's a really fun party.

01:20:14.577 --> 01:20:19.246
And it's nice to tell someone
that you're in

01:20:19.248 --> 01:20:21.182
and to say it to their face

01:20:21.184 --> 01:20:23.384
in front of this room
full of people.

01:20:24.821 --> 01:20:27.154
And it's nice to hear it back.

01:20:28.558 --> 01:20:31.192
Look, man, I love you.

01:20:31.194 --> 01:20:32.560
You're the best.

01:20:32.562 --> 01:20:35.262
But you're not that great.

01:20:35.264 --> 01:20:37.898
Right now you're kind of
like that guy

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.201
in an ice cream store who, like,
samples every single flavor

01:20:40.203 --> 01:20:41.368
before he picks one.

01:20:41.370 --> 01:20:42.970
That guy sucks.

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:45.906
But how can I know
what's best, though?

01:20:45.908 --> 01:20:48.142
You won't.

01:20:52.181 --> 01:20:53.948
Shit.

01:20:53.950 --> 01:20:55.883
I fucked up.

01:20:57.320 --> 01:20:59.286
Yes, you did.

01:21:02.291 --> 01:21:04.925
And it's -- it's not --

01:21:04.927 --> 01:21:06.126
it's not easy, you know,
because...

01:21:06.128 --> 01:21:08.229
- Louder!
- ...I'm the older brother

01:21:08.231 --> 01:21:10.297
and I don't even
have a girlfriend.

01:21:10.299 --> 01:21:11.432
Louder!

01:21:33.923 --> 01:21:36.056
Ben. How are you?

01:21:36.058 --> 01:21:37.992
Hey, Mr. Ricciardi,
how are you?

01:21:37.994 --> 01:21:39.660
I saw your dad yesterday.

01:21:39.662 --> 01:21:42.396
He said you might be looking
for a new line of work.

01:21:42.398 --> 01:21:43.597
Is that true?

01:21:43.599 --> 01:21:45.332
Yeah, yeah.
I don't really know.

01:21:45.334 --> 01:21:48.035
I really think you should
consider the flavor business.

01:21:48.037 --> 01:21:49.937
We could use smart people
like yourself.

01:21:49.939 --> 01:21:51.538
- Yeah.
- Just yesterday,

01:21:51.540 --> 01:21:56.510
my associate perfected a new
jalapeño pomegranate flavor.

01:21:56.512 --> 01:21:58.012
Have you ever heard
of such a thing?

01:21:58.014 --> 01:21:59.513
No, no, no.
I haven't.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.615
Hey, Mr. Ricciardi, have you
seen Alice Mori today?

01:22:01.617 --> 01:22:06.053
No. We also found a way
to make barbecue sprinkles.

01:22:06.055 --> 01:22:07.321
Not very good.

01:22:07.323 --> 01:22:08.555
- Ben?
- Alice.

01:22:10.660 --> 01:22:12.626
- Nate.
- Ben.

01:22:12.628 --> 01:22:14.595
How you doing, dude?

01:22:19.068 --> 01:22:20.534
I'm good. Yeah.

01:22:20.536 --> 01:22:22.937
- Harry Ricciardi.
- Nate Lam.

01:22:23.673 --> 01:22:25.606
I thought you couldn't come
to this one.

01:22:26.575 --> 01:22:30.077
Yeah. I, uh, moved my thing.

01:22:30.079 --> 01:22:34.682
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I have to go find the missus.

01:22:37.019 --> 01:22:39.453
So those flowers for me,
big guy?

01:22:39.455 --> 01:22:41.956
Oh. Uh, no. No.

01:22:41.958 --> 01:22:44.258
Th-They're -- They're for, um...

01:22:44.260 --> 01:22:46.093
uh, they're -- they're for her.

01:22:48.164 --> 01:22:49.363
Cartelli's stepmom?

01:22:49.365 --> 01:22:50.531
Yeah, she -- she loves flowers.

01:22:50.533 --> 01:22:52.633
Here you go.

01:22:52.635 --> 01:22:54.101
All right.

01:22:54.103 --> 01:22:56.070
What -- What's this?

01:23:11.187 --> 01:23:13.320
Oh-ho-ho-ho.

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:15.622
Oh, take care.
Come here, come here.

01:23:18.094 --> 01:23:22.563
Oh! Yes.
This guy. King Ben.

01:23:22.565 --> 01:23:24.198
The B-Zone!

01:23:24.200 --> 01:23:26.266
Mm! Bensanity.

01:23:26.268 --> 01:23:27.668
Hey, Cartelli, how are you?

01:23:27.670 --> 01:23:30.104
I'm great, man.
This is...

01:23:33.743 --> 01:23:36.110
Man, my little brother
just got married.

01:23:36.112 --> 01:23:40.047
I mean, it is -- Faah!
It's the best.

01:23:45.755 --> 01:23:48.522
Do you think
it'll ever happen for us?

01:23:50.192 --> 01:23:51.759
This?

01:23:54.230 --> 01:23:56.463
- I don't know.
- I don't know, either.

01:24:00.336 --> 01:24:02.269
Is this crazy?
You and me should go out

01:24:02.271 --> 01:24:03.570
one of these nights, you know?

01:24:03.572 --> 01:24:05.506
Because I need a wingman,
you know?

01:24:05.508 --> 01:24:10.044
'Cause I haven't had sex
in, like, six y-- six years.

01:24:11.647 --> 01:24:13.180
Uh...

01:24:13.182 --> 01:24:15.115
Hi.

01:24:16.519 --> 01:24:18.052
Hey, Cartelli,
I'll be right back.

01:24:18.054 --> 01:24:20.054
- Yeah. Yeah, man.
- Yeah.

01:24:20.056 --> 01:24:22.823
Hey, I'm here for you whenever,
so just hit me up.

01:24:22.825 --> 01:24:24.558
Throw up the Bat Signal!

01:24:30.466 --> 01:24:32.666
Let's go fucking party.

01:24:40.142 --> 01:24:41.608
Hey.

01:24:42.578 --> 01:24:44.311
Hey.

01:24:44.313 --> 01:24:45.712
Hi.

01:24:45.714 --> 01:24:48.515
Do you need
to use the girls' room?

01:24:49.318 --> 01:24:51.151
No.

01:24:52.855 --> 01:24:54.822
Those flowers were for you,
by the way.

01:24:54.824 --> 01:24:57.291
- Yeah. I know.
- Yeah.

01:24:57.293 --> 01:24:58.725
I was surprised.

01:24:58.727 --> 01:25:01.128
I thought you didn't like
the concept of flowers.

01:25:01.130 --> 01:25:02.830
Yeah, but I know you do.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.101
Uh, does he --
does he know about me?

01:25:07.103 --> 01:25:08.702
- Yeah.
- Huh.

01:25:08.704 --> 01:25:11.572
Mm. He doesn't love it.

01:25:11.574 --> 01:25:13.774
But, you know, the whole
Shaina from accounting thing

01:25:13.776 --> 01:25:14.808
kind of cancels out.

01:25:14.810 --> 01:25:17.544
Right. Yeah.

01:25:17.546 --> 01:25:21.315
Um, hey, can I --
can I say something?

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:22.749
Uh, no.

01:25:22.751 --> 01:25:24.551
Just -- I just need
to say one thing,

01:25:24.553 --> 01:25:26.553
and I'll -- I'll leave you
alone, I swear.

01:25:26.555 --> 01:25:27.888
I really can't handle
a big speech right now, Ben.

01:25:27.890 --> 01:25:30.591
It's not a big speech.

01:25:30.593 --> 01:25:33.293
It's a medium -- medium speech.

01:25:34.296 --> 01:25:36.430
Alice, you were right.

01:25:36.432 --> 01:25:38.298
You were right about me.

01:25:42.471 --> 01:25:43.637
I'm an asshole.

01:25:43.638 --> 01:25:44.804
And you were right
about these weddings.

01:25:44.807 --> 01:25:47.274
I-I can't do them on my own.
It's impossible.

01:25:47.276 --> 01:25:48.375
It's 'cause you're lonely.

01:25:48.377 --> 01:25:51.211
No. It's because
you're not there.

01:25:51.213 --> 01:25:55.149
You're not there to -- to insult
everything that I do.

01:25:55.151 --> 01:25:57.885
You're not there to make fun
of groomsmen photos

01:25:57.887 --> 01:26:00.754
and -- and -- and vows
and all the other bullshit.

01:26:02.525 --> 01:26:05.359
You're not there to order fish
at a fucking diner.

01:26:06.862 --> 01:26:08.395
And the worst part
about all this

01:26:08.397 --> 01:26:12.366
is that you're not there
because I hurt you.

01:26:13.335 --> 01:26:16.170
I hurt the one person
that never deserved it.

01:26:16.172 --> 01:26:18.572
And I pushed you away

01:26:18.574 --> 01:26:21.208
because I'm dumb
and I'm selfish,

01:26:21.210 --> 01:26:24.611
and fuck me for being too late,
but I love you, Alice.

01:26:27.950 --> 01:26:29.283
You love me?

01:26:29.285 --> 01:26:31.318
Of course.

01:26:33.589 --> 01:26:35.622
Ben, I really...

01:26:35.624 --> 01:26:36.924
Everything okay over here?

01:26:37.726 --> 01:26:39.293
Uh, yeah.

01:26:39.295 --> 01:26:42.262
Sorry. Nate, can we
just get five minutes?

01:26:42.264 --> 01:26:45.432
Um, I should really
go back inside.

01:26:46.769 --> 01:26:48.402
Bye, Ben.

01:27:04.653 --> 01:27:05.719
Alice?

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:07.221
Ben! Help!

01:27:07.223 --> 01:27:08.755
Dad? What's wrong?

01:27:08.757 --> 01:27:10.457
I'm fucking high.

01:27:10.459 --> 01:27:12.826
Jesus.
Where are you, Dad?

01:27:12.828 --> 01:27:13.927
Golf course!

01:27:13.929 --> 01:27:15.462
What? Golf course?

01:27:15.464 --> 01:27:17.497
It's so goddamn wet over here.

01:27:17.499 --> 01:27:18.665
I love you, Chuck.

01:27:18.667 --> 01:27:19.700
What are you doing
at a golf course

01:27:19.702 --> 01:27:20.734
at 1:00 in the morning?

01:27:20.736 --> 01:27:21.735
Help me, Ben.

01:27:21.737 --> 01:27:23.670
Okay, okay. I'm coming.

01:27:23.672 --> 01:27:25.639
What the fuck?

01:27:32.381 --> 01:27:35.415
Ah! Ben.
Thank God you're here.

01:27:35.417 --> 01:27:36.817
Dad, what the hell happened?

01:27:36.819 --> 01:27:38.418
It's a whole big thing, Ben.

01:27:38.420 --> 01:27:40.454
We ate all this acid,
and we went nuts.

01:27:40.456 --> 01:27:41.989
Why?
Why'd you do any of that?

01:27:41.991 --> 01:27:43.657
It's my bachelor party, Ben.

01:27:43.659 --> 01:27:45.826
It's his bachelor party, Ben.

01:27:45.828 --> 01:27:47.928
It's his bachelor party, Ben.

01:27:47.930 --> 01:27:50.697
Can I interest you gentlemen
in a quick trip to the diner?

01:27:50.699 --> 01:27:52.766
- Yeah.
- No, no.

01:27:52.768 --> 01:27:54.301
I'm dropping everyone off
at home.

01:27:54.303 --> 01:27:56.637
- Aw.
- Aw, Benjamin bummer.

01:27:56.639 --> 01:27:57.771
Bummer.

01:27:59.475 --> 01:28:00.941
Guys, where am I going?

01:28:00.943 --> 01:28:02.709
Drop them at Hanon's.

01:28:02.711 --> 01:28:04.611
You got it, man.
You know where to go.

01:28:04.613 --> 01:28:06.813
- I-I don't know where to go.
- Follow your heart.

01:28:06.815 --> 01:28:08.649
- I don't know where to go.
- Just trust for one second.

01:28:08.651 --> 01:28:11.351
- Hanon.
- Don't get into maps.

01:28:11.353 --> 01:28:13.420
And I need to hear
from some expert...

01:28:13.422 --> 01:28:14.955
- Dad.
- Just do it yourself.

01:28:14.957 --> 01:28:16.657
- Dad.
- Yes. Do it yourself, Ben.

01:28:16.659 --> 01:28:19.326
- Do it yourself.
- I'm doing this by myself.

01:28:19.328 --> 01:28:22.529
- Do it yourself.
- Dad, what is Hanon's address?

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:25.332
- Thanks, Ben.
- You're the best.

01:28:25.334 --> 01:28:27.301
- Thank you.
- Whoo!

01:28:27.303 --> 01:28:28.835
- No, this way.
- Hey. Hey. Hey.

01:28:28.837 --> 01:28:29.936
- Follow the light.
- Just --

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:31.071
- Uh, here.
- Come on, guys.

01:28:31.073 --> 01:28:32.439
Get in the house.
Get in the house.

01:28:32.441 --> 01:28:33.707
Whew.

01:28:34.877 --> 01:28:36.943
Time to lie down.

01:28:36.945 --> 01:28:38.712
Dad, I'm -- Dad, I'm driving.

01:28:38.714 --> 01:28:40.714
- Bad energy from the seat.
- Okay, just -- just --

01:28:40.716 --> 01:28:42.416
- I got to get back here.
- Can you tuck --

01:28:42.418 --> 01:28:43.884
tuck back there?

01:28:45.621 --> 01:28:49.990
Ben, I'm so glad
you're my best man.

01:28:49.992 --> 01:28:51.825
I'm not your best man, Dad.

01:28:51.827 --> 01:28:53.994
You're so cool.

01:28:53.996 --> 01:28:56.530
You are the best, man.

01:28:58.100 --> 01:29:00.067
Best man.

01:29:00.703 --> 01:29:03.503
Now I get why it's called that.

01:29:03.505 --> 01:29:05.605
Whew.

01:29:05.607 --> 01:29:07.774
I can't wait for <i> your</i> wife.

01:29:07.776 --> 01:29:09.009
Yeah, here we go.

01:29:09.011 --> 01:29:11.478
You think it's gonna be Alice?

01:29:12.614 --> 01:29:14.047
- No, Dad.
- Why?

01:29:14.049 --> 01:29:16.116
She's so wacky.

01:29:16.118 --> 01:29:17.984
We broke up.

01:29:17.986 --> 01:29:20.420
Oh, no.
That's too bad.

01:29:21.724 --> 01:29:24.791
- Hey. Hey, Ben.
- Yeah.

01:29:24.793 --> 01:29:26.727
- Ben.
- Yeah, Dad.

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:30.464
Do you hate Gina?

01:29:30.466 --> 01:29:32.466
- No. No, Dad.
- Tell me the fucking truth.

01:29:32.468 --> 01:29:34.000
- Do you hate Gina?
- I don't hate Gina.

01:29:34.002 --> 01:29:36.570
Then why are you so mad
about us?

01:29:37.606 --> 01:29:39.840
I'm not mad, Dad.
I just --

01:29:40.943 --> 01:29:44.611
Dad, you're a little bit hard
to root for sometimes.

01:29:46.415 --> 01:29:50.384
When you and Mom split,
it really messed me up.

01:29:50.386 --> 01:29:52.119
And I just decided I didn't
want to be like you guys.

01:29:52.121 --> 01:29:53.754
I just wanted to find the one

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:57.124
and -- and hang on to her
forever.

01:29:58.694 --> 01:30:00.761
And now I'm completely alone.

01:30:00.763 --> 01:30:02.863
So...

01:30:02.865 --> 01:30:05.599
And you're just moving on
to your next family.

01:30:05.601 --> 01:30:06.933
Ben.

01:30:06.935 --> 01:30:09.936
I'm sorry that your mother and I
splitting up

01:30:09.938 --> 01:30:12.105
hurt you so much.

01:30:12.107 --> 01:30:14.608
What she and I had was great.

01:30:15.411 --> 01:30:17.043
I'd be nothing
if I hadn't met her,

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:19.045
and I wouldn't have you.

01:30:20.449 --> 01:30:21.715
And, buddy...

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:27.421
...as long as I'm alive,
you will never be alone.

01:30:34.463 --> 01:30:35.962
Hey, Ben?

01:30:35.964 --> 01:30:37.664
Yeah, Dad.

01:30:37.666 --> 01:30:39.800
Can we do drive-through?

01:30:39.802 --> 01:30:42.068
Sure. Is there somewhere
you want to go?

01:30:42.070 --> 01:30:43.737
Zapburger.

01:30:44.673 --> 01:30:47.174
Where is -- What --
What is Zapburger?

01:30:47.176 --> 01:30:52.546
They get a patty
made with organic soy meat,

01:30:52.548 --> 01:30:54.748
and they cook it with lasers.

01:30:56.018 --> 01:30:58.051
It's a perfect burger.

01:30:59.488 --> 01:31:01.021
Okay, Dad.

01:31:03.692 --> 01:31:06.827
Don't take the freeway.
Take surface streets.

01:31:09.798 --> 01:31:11.998
Holy shit.

01:31:14.236 --> 01:31:15.635
Hey, everyone.

01:31:15.637 --> 01:31:17.471
Thanks for coming.

01:31:17.473 --> 01:31:19.139
I'm Ben,

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:22.209
and most of you here
probably know me as Chuck's son.

01:31:22.211 --> 01:31:24.244
And if you're wondering
why <i> I'm</i> up here

01:31:24.246 --> 01:31:28.014
giving <i> his</i> best man speech,
so am I.

01:31:30.819 --> 01:31:35.555
Truth is, I put up
a pretty big stink

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:36.857
about all this.

01:31:36.859 --> 01:31:39.826
I-I just didn't want to do it.

01:31:40.729 --> 01:31:44.798
To me, a third marriage
was ill-advised.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:48.034
I mean, hell, even a second one
was hard to swallow.

01:31:49.738 --> 01:31:53.540
But also, I just didn't get it.

01:31:53.542 --> 01:31:54.808
- Ah.
- Thank you.

01:31:54.810 --> 01:31:57.010
I believed
in things like fate

01:31:57.012 --> 01:31:58.678
and love at first sight,

01:31:58.680 --> 01:32:00.514
that once you found the one...

01:32:00.516 --> 01:32:01.948
Yay.

01:32:01.950 --> 01:32:03.650
...that was the ballgame.

01:32:03.652 --> 01:32:05.085
Chuck.

01:32:05.087 --> 01:32:07.988
But the truth is,

01:32:07.990 --> 01:32:11.591
if you spend your whole life
looking for perfect...

01:32:15.931 --> 01:32:17.998
...you wind up with nothing.

01:32:25.607 --> 01:32:28.775
See, there are many innings
to this ballgame.

01:32:29.311 --> 01:32:32.112
And I don't think
love is about chance run-ins

01:32:32.114 --> 01:32:33.179
or cute accidents.

01:32:34.550 --> 01:32:36.783
It's simpler than that.

01:32:36.785 --> 01:32:40.887
It's about finding someone
you want to hang out with

01:32:40.889 --> 01:32:44.090
as long as humanly possible
and just...

01:32:46.261 --> 01:32:48.328
...just trying
not to screw it up.

01:32:52.067 --> 01:32:54.067
Keep going.

01:32:55.737 --> 01:32:57.270
But you will mess up.

01:32:59.708 --> 01:33:03.176
No matter how hard you try,
you'll get in your own way.

01:33:07.115 --> 01:33:09.783
But if you can learn
from your mistakes...

01:33:12.187 --> 01:33:15.622
You know you don't deserve
a second chance, right?

01:33:15.624 --> 01:33:17.090
Oh, yeah.

01:33:19.027 --> 01:33:20.961
...you might
just build something...

01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:25.065
...even better.

01:33:26.368 --> 01:33:28.335
So I'd like to raise a glass.

01:33:30.205 --> 01:33:35.308
Gina, Dad, congratulations.

01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:46.319
- You, get in here.
- Yeah.

01:33:46.321 --> 01:33:47.887
Come on, come on, come on.

01:33:47.889 --> 01:33:50.924
- Hoo.
- All right. I'm in. I'm in.

01:33:54.696 --> 01:33:57.397
Oh, my God. I have heard
so much about you.

01:34:09.378 --> 01:34:10.944
That's it?

01:34:10.946 --> 01:34:13.046
What do you --
What do you mean, that's it?

01:34:13.048 --> 01:34:15.248
You cannot shout out
your dad's divorces.

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.217
That's insane.
Gina's gonna kill you.

01:34:17.219 --> 01:34:18.385
I'm just trying to be honest.

01:34:18.387 --> 01:34:19.986
Then be honest.

01:34:19.988 --> 01:34:22.022
Say, "I learned about love

01:34:22.024 --> 01:34:25.892
after I hurt Alice
and then came crawling back."

01:34:25.894 --> 01:34:27.994
I did not come
crawling back to you.

01:34:27.996 --> 01:34:31.865
Oh, you fucking crawled.
You crawled, Benjamin.

01:34:31.867 --> 01:34:33.366
If anything,<i> you</i> crawled back.

01:34:33.368 --> 01:34:35.402
Don't you fucking dare.

01:34:35.404 --> 01:34:37.270
You did. You literally
waited for me to come home,

01:34:37.272 --> 01:34:38.838
and then you kissed me
real good.

01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.707
That's not how I remember it.

01:34:40.709 --> 01:34:42.275
Alice, are you actually
gonna help me with this speech?

01:34:42.277 --> 01:34:43.877
Yes. Okay, Ben.
Why don't you end it

01:34:43.879 --> 01:34:45.679
with "boom-shakalaka"?

01:34:45.681 --> 01:34:47.347
Hell, yes.

01:34:47.349 --> 01:34:49.149
