00:29.920 --> 00:32.950
In 1963, it seemed

00:33.000 --> 00:35.750
humanity knew no bounds.

00:35.800 --> 00:39.430
Our horizon stretched into
infinity as we tour through

00:39.480 --> 00:43.480
the atmosphere venturing
into the galaxy itself.

00:45.240 --> 00:50.230
The universe felt so vast, it dwarfed us.

00:50.280 --> 00:53.840
There were times the wait
was more than we could bare.

00:55.000 --> 00:57.070
- Nurse Franklin,
what's the matter? - Uh!

00:58.120 --> 01:02.350
My chain's come off, my brakes are
slack and my bell's stopped ringing.

01:02.400 --> 01:04.440
But the bike's all right though!

01:13.500 --> 01:16.510
Rosie, keep your hand
away from the needle.

01:16.560 --> 01:20.030
I don't want you hurt, or a
machine put out of action.

01:20.080 --> 01:21.390
And neither does Mr Gani.

01:21.440 --> 01:23.590
Where is the boss today?

01:23.640 --> 01:26.590
One boss is away attending
to a family matter.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.040
And the other one is standing
right in front of you.

01:31.440 --> 01:37.190
Strawberries again. The torments of
Prometheus are summoned to my mind.

01:37.240 --> 01:40.990
You'll have to pretend
you're at Wimbledon, Sister.

01:41.040 --> 01:43.830
Do you have any plans, Nurse Anderson?

01:43.880 --> 01:45.910
They have a gospel choir at my church,

01:45.960 --> 01:47.910
and I'm going with my friend Sybil.

01:47.960 --> 01:51.270
I'm meeting with my Spanish
class for an evening of sangria

01:51.320 --> 01:53.390
and Iberian snacks.

01:53.440 --> 01:56.230
I had to concede failure in
my pursuit of chorizo sausage

01:56.280 --> 02:01.240
for them, but I've made shift
with some spicy luncheon meat.

02:02.840 --> 02:07.160
Nurse Franklin? Do you have
you any plans this evening?

02:09.960 --> 02:13.430
I thought I might sort
out my nylons drawer.

02:13.480 --> 02:15.110
Or my manicure tray.

02:15.160 --> 02:17.750
Or I might even get out my Keep Fit manual

02:17.800 --> 02:22.120
and finally master the
half-clam scissor lift.

02:23.200 --> 02:26.750
There really is no end of
things one can do with a whole,

02:26.800 --> 02:28.320
free Friday night.

02:36.000 --> 02:37.310
Salaam begum.

02:37.360 --> 02:38.990
- Where is she?
- She's resting.

02:39.040 --> 02:40.080
Come. Sit down.

02:43.040 --> 02:45.550
I need to talk to you.

02:45.600 --> 02:48.310
Parveen? Cousin, let me see you!

02:48.360 --> 02:53.550
- Wait.
- Saddiq? What is it? Is she ill?

02:53.600 --> 02:56.160
No.

02:57.800 --> 02:59.950
It is quite unexpected.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.110
We are blessed.

03:02.160 --> 03:04.430
Mumtaz.

03:04.480 --> 03:07.350
What is this? Have you brought a husband?

03:07.400 --> 03:11.070
Mere abbe ne palaey, sari gal mithi ho si?

03:11.120 --> 03:13.960
What is she saying? Arranged it?

03:15.200 --> 03:17.760
When I went home for my father's funeral.

03:20.680 --> 03:23.270
My mother had already decided.

03:23.320 --> 03:25.280
Your family agreed.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.120
You have taken another wife?

03:36.560 --> 03:38.160
I am so sorry.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.480
You are the father?

03:44.520 --> 03:46.360
Do not be sad.

03:48.320 --> 03:50.270
I feel sick.

03:50.320 --> 03:52.560
- Mumtaz, please...
- Leave me.

04:49.760 --> 04:52.350
There's a busy district list this week,

04:52.400 --> 04:55.110
which I am handing on to Sister Winifred.

04:55.160 --> 04:57.990
And if you'd take the post-natal patients,

04:58.040 --> 05:01.830
Nurse Anderson, I'd like you
to spend some extra time with

05:01.880 --> 05:04.510
Mrs Diller, one of those twins
isn't gaining as she ought.

05:04.560 --> 05:08.110
Meanwhile, just two bookings-in
for you, Nurse Franklin.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.230
You can have a bit of an
easy wicket for a change.

05:10.280 --> 05:13.040
Phyllis! I, I don't want an easy wicket!

05:18.160 --> 05:19.990
Maybe not.

05:20.040 --> 05:22.870
But in my view, you need it.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.790
You've had a bit of a setback
in the romantic stakes,

05:25.840 --> 05:28.230
and I dare say poor Mr Dockerill
is drilling and filling

05:28.280 --> 05:30.880
at the dental department
with a face as long as yours.

05:33.200 --> 05:37.430
I need to keep busy! Work
will be the perfect cure.

05:37.480 --> 05:40.070
Nursing is about curing patients, Trixie.

05:40.120 --> 05:42.120
Not our own broken hearts.

05:43.680 --> 05:46.030
And I am not going to overstretch you

05:46.080 --> 05:48.680
until you can give of your best, again.

05:54.120 --> 05:55.910
Thank you, Mrs Gani.

05:55.960 --> 05:59.920
Sister will help you to dress,
and then take a blood sample.

06:01.240 --> 06:03.320
This won't hurt, Parveen.

06:04.520 --> 06:06.950
I promise you.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.390
Please.

06:08.440 --> 06:09.480
Is she ill?

06:11.320 --> 06:13.400
Or is something the matter with the baby?

06:14.440 --> 06:18.670
There is nothing to suppose the
baby is anything other than healthy.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.720
And your wife seems well.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.280
It says here that she is 15 years old.

06:25.800 --> 06:28.390
I wouldn't say anything that is untrue.

06:28.440 --> 06:29.750
She is 15.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.710
That's below the legal
age of marriage here,

06:32.760 --> 06:35.390
but that is none of my concern.

06:35.440 --> 06:39.080
The fact that she is a very
young first-time mother is.

06:40.600 --> 06:44.150
Just think how grateful the
knees of the faithful will be!

06:44.200 --> 06:46.990
If the fingers of the faithful
were doing their share,

06:47.040 --> 06:48.950
we wouldn't have got roped into this.

06:49.000 --> 06:51.230
Valerie and I are benighted heathen

06:51.280 --> 06:53.110
and Lucille doesn't
even go to this church!

06:53.160 --> 06:55.920
We are all one congregation under God.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.400
Would you pass the Penguin
biscuits, please, Trixie?

07:06.040 --> 07:08.750
Just look at this poor lady astronaut.

07:08.800 --> 07:12.590
The moment she puts on her helmet,
her bouffant will be ruined.

07:12.640 --> 07:17.440
Where immortality is concerned,
the coiffure is an irrelevance.

07:18.520 --> 07:24.870
Valentina Tereshkova's name is
destined to echo down the centuries.

07:24.920 --> 07:28.070
Ooh, I get this little
shiver every time they say

07:28.120 --> 07:30.510
"first woman in space".

07:30.560 --> 07:33.430
Just the idea that there'll be
other girls, going all that way.

07:33.480 --> 07:35.390
Doing all those things.

07:35.440 --> 07:39.000
My gran can remember people throwing
stones at a female bus conductor.

07:43.400 --> 07:47.510
Have you mislaid something,
Sister Monica Joan?

07:47.560 --> 07:52.640
I have parted company with my
bodkin, and sought to retrieve it.

07:55.400 --> 07:59.190
There are needles aplenty in my chamber,

07:59.240 --> 08:04.760
I shall take this hassock
there and sew until Compline.

08:11.560 --> 08:13.230
Mrs Loretta Campbell?

08:13.280 --> 08:15.150
That's me.

08:15.200 --> 08:17.680
Would you like to wait in
here? I won't be a moment.

08:32.679 --> 08:34.559
Sorry for the delay.

08:37.799 --> 08:40.720
What do you have in there?
A sneaky piece of cake?

08:42.440 --> 08:45.480
Something like that. I, I get peckish.

08:46.600 --> 08:47.830
I don't know what that is.

08:47.880 --> 08:50.030
But it doesn't look like cake.

08:50.080 --> 08:51.120
No.

08:53.200 --> 08:55.670
It's coal.

08:55.720 --> 08:57.040
Coal?

08:58.360 --> 09:03.160
I can't help myself. And I'm so ashamed.

09:08.800 --> 09:11.280
Oi! You're on private property!

09:12.680 --> 09:17.590
When I find a device that belongs to
me secreted in your outhouse amongst

09:17.640 --> 09:21.910
your dibbers and your trowels and
your long toms, it would appear

09:21.960 --> 09:26.270
to me that it is not I who requires
a reminder of proprietary rights!

09:26.320 --> 09:29.630
Look, I'm sorry, Sister Monica Joan!
I didn't realise it belonged to you!

09:29.680 --> 09:31.510
Must I have everything monogrammed,

09:31.560 --> 09:34.750
like garments going to the laundry?

09:34.800 --> 09:38.960
Marked, like the possessions of an infant?

09:55.160 --> 09:58.230
You could have started a grass fire.

09:58.280 --> 09:59.760
Oh...

10:01.520 --> 10:03.840
It upsets me when you
upset yourself, Sister.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.550
I require this.

10:07.600 --> 10:09.790
And I require that it is not moved,

10:09.840 --> 10:12.800
when I place it somewhere
for safe keeping.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.760
Perhaps we can attach it to a
piece of elastic around your wrist.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.950
When I took the veil,

10:27.000 --> 10:31.240
I vowed to surrender
the world of the senses.

10:33.400 --> 10:35.110
But some senses, it seems,

10:35.160 --> 10:38.640
are harder to relinquish
than their counterparts.

10:40.280 --> 10:42.440
We'll sort something out.

10:43.600 --> 10:45.360
I promise.

10:48.040 --> 10:51.430
Lots of women crave different
foods when they are pregnant.

10:51.480 --> 10:55.830
Pilchards, gherkins, sherbert lemons.

10:55.880 --> 10:58.030
Believe me, I've seen it all!

10:58.080 --> 11:01.230
It was marmalade sandwiches
when I had my first.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.710
Apart from the fact that
I can't stand marmalade,

11:03.760 --> 11:06.390
it never seemed so strange that
I had to eat them in secret.

11:06.440 --> 11:09.190
The good news is that
in every single case,

11:09.240 --> 11:12.470
the urge goes away as soon
as the mother gives birth.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.150
What if it hurts the baby?

11:14.200 --> 11:17.990
My sister-in-law couldn't
stay away from strawberries,

11:18.040 --> 11:20.470
and her poor little girl
came out with a bright red

11:20.520 --> 11:22.350
mark right down one side of her face!

11:22.400 --> 11:24.950
That would just have been a coincidence.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.710
When an expectant mother feels
compelled to keep eating

11:28.760 --> 11:31.630
certain things, it's called "pica".

11:31.680 --> 11:34.030
- There's a name for it?
- Oh, yes.

11:34.080 --> 11:36.990
And whole chapters in
obstetric text books.

11:37.040 --> 11:39.070
You're almost ready to have
this baby so you won't...

11:39.120 --> 11:42.790
I'd give anything to just
want a marmalade sandwich!

11:42.840 --> 11:45.240
.. so you won't be
suffering for much longer.

11:48.640 --> 11:51.080
- I did not choose this.
- No.

11:52.200 --> 11:54.630
Our families did. I cannot blame you.

11:54.680 --> 11:59.990
I cannot blame her. What
can I feel? What can I do?

12:00.040 --> 12:01.670
I don't know.

12:01.720 --> 12:05.270
What we had wasn't everything we wanted.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.800
But the business became our child.

12:09.240 --> 12:12.550
It grew, it cost us sleep,

12:12.600 --> 12:14.510
it made us proud.

12:14.560 --> 12:16.150
For me.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.920
It showed me what love is.

12:18.920 --> 12:21.360
What it means to be husband and wife.

12:22.680 --> 12:25.950
When we met, when we were married,

12:26.000 --> 12:27.960
we did not know what those words meant.

12:30.040 --> 12:32.280
And we learned to share everything.

12:33.760 --> 12:35.920
But we cannot share this.

12:42.040 --> 12:46.230
Bit more tightening, and you
shouldn't have any more trouble.

12:46.280 --> 12:49.390
You look after us so well, I
wasn't aware there was any trouble.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.710
Well...

12:50.760 --> 12:53.670
that's the way of the
world, isn't it, Sister?

12:53.720 --> 12:57.030
Full of pickles and predicaments,
we don't always notice them.

12:57.080 --> 13:00.150
Are you in a... a pickle,
or a predicament, Fred?

13:00.200 --> 13:03.030
Not me. Sister Monica Joan.

13:03.080 --> 13:05.670
Or more particularly, her eyes.

13:05.720 --> 13:08.350
I wondered if her sight was deteriorating.

13:08.400 --> 13:10.670
It is so very common with age.

13:10.720 --> 13:13.670
I reckon it's a lot worse
than she's letting on.

13:13.720 --> 13:17.670
She's using a very strong
magnifying glass, only in secret,

13:17.720 --> 13:21.750
and without it, it's
like she's almost blind.

13:21.800 --> 13:23.830
Why isn't she admitting it?

13:23.880 --> 13:25.720
I don't know, Sister. Pride?

13:27.200 --> 13:30.590
And perhaps she fears nothing can be done.

13:30.640 --> 13:33.470
Or -- begging your
pardon, Sister Julienne --

13:33.520 --> 13:35.950
the fear that something can be.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.510
Well, she never was too
keen on medical intervention.

13:39.560 --> 13:42.110
Remember the carry-on
with the Mass X-ray van?

13:42.160 --> 13:44.710
She locked herself in the bathroom,
I had to get my ladders out!

13:44.760 --> 13:47.030
Quite.

13:47.080 --> 13:52.510
Your care for her then did you
credit, and does you credit now.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.510
And I must match it with my own,

13:54.560 --> 13:58.360
and make sure that we give
her the help she that needs.

14:07.800 --> 14:10.030
Midwife's here, Loretta.

14:10.080 --> 14:12.390
Hello, Mrs Campbell.

14:12.440 --> 14:16.110
You seem to be doing nicely.
Looks like I'm just in time.

14:16.160 --> 14:18.190
I don't know about nicely.

14:18.240 --> 14:21.630
I've got an ironing pile
the size of Ben bloody Nevis

14:21.680 --> 14:24.360
and five pounds of potatoes
still to peel for the tea.

14:24.960 --> 14:28.030
Well, I'm going to look
you over, get you settled

14:28.080 --> 14:30.310
and then we'll see about
bringing a neighbour to help.

14:30.360 --> 14:33.030
Nutty slack on the chest of
drawers is never a good sign.

14:33.080 --> 14:36.030
I feel sick at the thought of it.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.950
Smuggling it round in my
hankie, or my handbag,

14:40.000 --> 14:42.080
running into the toilets with it.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.150
Eating it behind closed doors.

14:45.200 --> 14:49.400
I try not to give in,
Nurse, I, I really do.

14:51.200 --> 14:54.320
And when you do give
in, do you feel better?

14:55.320 --> 14:58.070
I feel bloody brilliant, Nurse.

14:58.120 --> 15:00.190
For a minute.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.840
And then it all begins again...

15:05.520 --> 15:07.270
No...

15:07.320 --> 15:08.430
No...

15:08.480 --> 15:09.960
Shush.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.470
I think it is a wonderful
achievement and I think we might be

15:13.520 --> 15:15.950
able to persuade the wife, it
would be a good idea if I could,

15:16.000 --> 15:17.790
to get her to go up
there for a little while.

15:17.840 --> 15:19.750
You're blocking the view, Sister.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.910
There she is!

15:21.960 --> 15:24.270
Isn't this marvellous?

15:24.320 --> 15:27.230
I'd give anything to see my
family on a screen like this.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.750
I wonder if she felt
lonely up there by herself?

15:29.800 --> 15:32.150
She would have had no time to feel lonely.

15:32.200 --> 15:36.720
She is a fearless adventurer,
fulfilling her destiny!

15:40.480 --> 15:45.270
A perfectly formed, and might I
add, angelic looking, baby girl.

15:45.320 --> 15:46.360
She's all right.

15:47.960 --> 15:52.110
Look at her. I didn't hurt her after all.

15:52.160 --> 15:55.110
See, nothing to feel guilty about.

15:55.160 --> 15:57.110
You must feel proud of her, Mr Campbell?

15:57.160 --> 16:00.430
Oh, I do. You're a trooper
all right, Loretta.

16:00.480 --> 16:03.630
A baby sister! What do
you reckon to her, Robert?

16:03.680 --> 16:05.840
Do you like her?

16:07.000 --> 16:09.110
She's absolutely picture perfect.

16:09.160 --> 16:11.910
She's definitely all right?
She didn't come to no harm?

16:11.960 --> 16:13.430
Not remotely!

16:13.480 --> 16:17.870
And you'll probably find the
cravings will vanish now she's here.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.430
You don't want a bit of coal
to munch on with your sherry?

16:20.480 --> 16:24.350
I do not! You can throw
every last lump in the fire.

16:24.400 --> 16:26.430
Now that's worth toasting!

16:26.480 --> 16:28.470
Isn't it? Oh.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.190
I'm on duty, I'm afraid.

16:30.240 --> 16:33.070
What's the harm? It's
only a granny's tipple.

16:33.120 --> 16:34.600
Hardly a drink at all.

16:46.520 --> 16:48.550
Come in.

16:48.600 --> 16:50.230
You have a visitor, Sister.

16:50.280 --> 16:52.070
It is not convenient.

16:52.120 --> 16:55.150
I am engaged in my spiritual
reading for the day.

16:55.200 --> 16:56.600
It's Doctor Turner.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.110
I won't detain you long, Sister.

17:00.160 --> 17:03.270
But it would be good to
have a chat for five minutes.

17:03.320 --> 17:07.390
I am a stranger to the artifice
of "chatting", Doctor Turner.

17:07.440 --> 17:09.589
And so are you.

17:09.640 --> 17:14.589
If you invade my chamber, I
must presume that your purpose is

17:14.640 --> 17:20.109
malignant, and I insist that you retreat.

17:20.160 --> 17:25.200
Just five minutes, and then you'll
have all day to do your reading.

17:26.359 --> 17:30.430
With the magnifying glass a
little bird told me about.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.720
There's no need for you to keep
it a secret any more, Sister.

17:47.040 --> 17:51.270
This must be one of the strongest
lenses available, Sister.

17:51.320 --> 17:53.350
But it won't brighten colours,

17:53.400 --> 17:56.590
or take away blurring of
things in the middle distance.

17:56.640 --> 17:59.590
You know nothing of my visual acuity.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.430
No. I'm just guessing.

18:02.480 --> 18:05.320
But I am guessing that you have cataracts.

18:06.400 --> 18:09.480
And I know that there is plenty we can do.

18:12.000 --> 18:14.200
May I sit down, Parveen?

18:22.720 --> 18:24.870
You are a nurse.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.630
Midwives are special nurses
who help the baby to be born,

18:28.680 --> 18:31.670
and make sure the mother
has all the help she needs.

18:31.720 --> 18:33.440
My mother is in Pakistan.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.830
Is that her? Oh, she looks beautiful.

18:38.880 --> 18:40.950
Mumtaz my cousin.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.990
This her house.

18:43.040 --> 18:46.110
Could Mumtaz bring you
to clinic next Tuesday?

18:46.160 --> 18:47.710
I can check you over now,

18:47.760 --> 18:50.710
but if you come to clinic you
can meet some other mums.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.350
Mumtaz work in factory.

18:54.400 --> 18:55.950
Where's your husband?

18:56.000 --> 18:59.280
In photograph? Here.

19:00.480 --> 19:03.070
No, no. I meant your husband.

19:03.120 --> 19:06.150
- Not your cousin's.
- He is my husband.

19:06.200 --> 19:07.390
He marry me.

19:07.440 --> 19:09.160
But he marry her first.

19:12.480 --> 19:15.030
I shall submit neither to the knife,

19:15.080 --> 19:18.070
nor Doctor Turner's
mountebank mould pills.

19:18.120 --> 19:21.670
I care not what remedies he suggests.

19:21.720 --> 19:23.750
Penicillin has not even been suggested,

19:23.800 --> 19:25.590
because your eyes are not infected.

19:25.640 --> 19:29.750
The lenses have simply
clouded over with age

19:29.800 --> 19:31.950
and an operation will restore them.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.510
Milton lost his sight at 43,

19:34.560 --> 19:39.110
and the verse he wrote upon
the topic is pitiful indeed.

19:39.160 --> 19:42.430
"Blind among enemies, O worse
than chains, dungeons, beggary,

19:42.480 --> 19:48.630
"or decrepit age."

19:48.680 --> 19:52.830
And I don't doubt that he would
have leapt at the chance of surgery.

19:52.880 --> 19:57.470
I am a far greater age than he.

19:57.520 --> 20:02.030
I have curated and collated in my mind

20:02.080 --> 20:05.470
an entire library of books,

20:05.520 --> 20:10.840
into which I can retreat
when the light deserts me.

20:16.240 --> 20:18.790
And if you could rely upon your mind,

20:18.840 --> 20:21.110
I would willingly let you go there.

20:21.160 --> 20:22.710
But you cannot.

20:22.760 --> 20:25.960
And I will not abandon you to darkness.

20:46.520 --> 20:49.630
Sister Julienne won't say
Grace till you come down,

20:49.680 --> 20:51.030
and the flan is going cold.

20:51.080 --> 20:55.470
Cold flan? I can't possibly
have that on my conscience.

20:55.520 --> 20:59.390
I couldn't believe what
I was hearing at first.

20:59.440 --> 21:02.790
Two wives. That is bigamy!

21:02.840 --> 21:05.360
Not according to the law in Pakistan.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.630
A man can take up to
four if he has a mind to.

21:09.680 --> 21:13.190
But this is a Christian country.
And this is where they live now.

21:13.240 --> 21:15.110
There was a bigamist lived down our street

21:15.160 --> 21:17.310
when I was growing up in Leeds.

21:17.360 --> 21:20.470
He was a commercial
traveller in women's hosiery

21:20.520 --> 21:24.070
and he had a second wife and
family on the go in Fleetwood,

21:24.120 --> 21:28.030
plus a mistress in Nuneaton he
was trying to get engaged to.

21:28.080 --> 21:30.590
I feel sorry for the first Mrs Gani.

21:30.640 --> 21:33.470
First wives are often
stronger than you think.

21:33.520 --> 21:36.830
The world would be a far
more harmonious place were

21:36.880 --> 21:42.070
we less concerned with the imagined
strengths and frailty of others.

21:42.120 --> 21:45.390
If we weren't alert to
the frailties of others,

21:45.440 --> 21:48.800
there's a great deal of
caring that wouldn't get done.

21:50.360 --> 21:53.400
I will go and see Parveen
Gani, and her family.

21:56.640 --> 21:59.710
Here's Sister Monica
Joan's referral letter.

21:59.760 --> 22:02.550
Mr Greswell doesn't have
a very long waiting list.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.590
The sooner the better, I think.

22:04.640 --> 22:09.310
Before she decides to flee Nonnatus
House disguised as a washer woman.

22:09.360 --> 22:13.510
She needs to be accompanied to
hospital by someone she can trust.

22:13.560 --> 22:17.430
And it sounds as though Sister
Julienne is in her bad books.

22:17.480 --> 22:19.230
Let's see when they can fit her in.

22:19.280 --> 22:22.320
I'll take her myself, if she
hasn't come round to the notion.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.270
Why don't you go and lie down?

22:33.320 --> 22:36.750
So that you are resting when
the midwife comes? Go on!

22:36.800 --> 22:40.270
I don't want rest. And I don't want this.

22:40.320 --> 22:41.470
Don't want what?

22:41.520 --> 22:45.990
You hating me. Your
husband to be my husband.

22:46.040 --> 22:49.870
And this. I don't want this.

22:49.920 --> 22:52.390
The midwife has come to see Parveen.

22:52.440 --> 22:55.040
Obviously she has come to see Parveen.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.590
If your blood pressure is raised,

22:58.640 --> 23:03.110
it means we need to look out for
other signs of complications.

23:03.160 --> 23:05.800
But this is a very healthy reading.

23:07.920 --> 23:10.390
Have you discussed where you
want the baby to be born?

23:10.440 --> 23:11.670
There is a choice?

23:11.720 --> 23:13.910
Hospital delivery is available,

23:13.960 --> 23:17.430
but we encourage home
birth where possible.

23:17.480 --> 23:21.190
Do you have any children
of your own, Mrs Gani?

23:21.240 --> 23:23.430
No.

23:23.480 --> 23:24.520
Thakkeh maar da.

23:26.160 --> 23:28.160
She says it's kicking.

23:31.560 --> 23:32.800
I think that's an elbow.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.720
- Morning, Nurse.
- Oh, good morning.

23:40.760 --> 23:44.390
Your ankles are looking lovely
and slender, Mrs Campbell --

23:44.440 --> 23:47.240
you're already losing that puffiness.

23:48.720 --> 23:52.190
And Baby's latching on
like a professional.

23:52.240 --> 23:54.710
Have you got any Anadin?

23:54.760 --> 23:58.590
I don't carry proprietary
medications, Mr Campbell.

23:58.640 --> 24:01.590
Might I surmise you've been
wetting the baby's head?

24:01.640 --> 24:03.590
Half-drowning it, more like.

24:03.640 --> 24:06.310
He was down the Black Sail till all hours,

24:06.360 --> 24:10.990
and he kicked it all off with that
sherry he had with Nurse Franklin.

24:11.040 --> 24:13.430
Did he indeed?

24:13.480 --> 24:17.310
I reckon Nurse Franklin would
rather have had some Tio Pepe,

24:17.360 --> 24:19.510
you see it on the adverts.

24:19.560 --> 24:22.880
But she didn't seem to mind
that it was only Bristol Cream.

24:24.200 --> 24:27.230
We'll try Baby on the
other breast in a moment.

24:27.280 --> 24:29.760
When Mr Campbell has repaired elsewhere.

24:34.520 --> 24:35.450
Entrez!

24:37.000 --> 24:38.670
Oh, hello Phyllis!

24:38.720 --> 24:42.310
I was offered a box of Milk Tray by
a grateful patient this afternoon.

24:42.360 --> 24:44.830
Slightly shop soiled,
but I couldn't resist.

24:44.880 --> 24:47.990
Help yourself -- though I'm afraid
I beat you to the lime barrel.

24:48.040 --> 24:51.990
A box of Milk Tray isn't the only
thing you were offered, is it?

24:52.040 --> 24:54.550
- Or the only thing you
couldn't resist? - I'm sorry.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.230
I don't know what you mean.

24:56.280 --> 24:59.350
You drank sherry at the Campbell's house.

24:59.400 --> 25:01.960
Yesterday, after the baby was born.

25:03.600 --> 25:06.150
They put me on the spot.

25:06.200 --> 25:09.150
I want you to tell me it
was an isolated incident.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.830
A one-off.

25:10.880 --> 25:12.830
A momentary slip.

25:12.880 --> 25:15.910
But I don't think you can, can you?

25:15.960 --> 25:19.510
A little brightener now and
again isn't the end of the world.

25:19.560 --> 25:22.550
It's the end of your being
in control of things.

25:22.600 --> 25:24.960
However much you might
try to argue otherwise.

25:26.440 --> 25:32.870
And I do try. Lately, I've almost
managed to convince myself...

25:32.920 --> 25:35.990
- Trixie, have you stopped
going to your meetings? - No.

25:36.040 --> 25:38.070
- Are you sure?
- Phyllis.

25:38.120 --> 25:41.030
- I'm not a child!
- No.

25:41.080 --> 25:43.910
You're a nurse, and a midwife, Trixie.

25:43.960 --> 25:45.750
And there are rules.

25:45.800 --> 25:47.800
Rules you've broken.

25:49.440 --> 25:51.880
As well as the promises
you've made to yourself.

25:54.200 --> 25:56.110
Are you...

25:56.160 --> 25:58.160
are you going to report me?

25:59.560 --> 26:01.710
Not this time.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.750
But you must keep attending
your meetings, Trixie.

26:04.800 --> 26:06.870
I'll go back. I promise

26:06.920 --> 26:08.840
You did stop going, then?

26:23.400 --> 26:24.760
Mrs Gani.

26:26.040 --> 26:27.910
I am afraid Parveen is not here.

26:27.960 --> 26:29.070
I'm glad.

26:29.120 --> 26:31.160
Because I wanted to see you.

26:32.360 --> 26:33.950
There.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.590
One handkerchief, neatly
pressed and ready for action.

26:37.640 --> 26:41.230
I know not why you insist
on my taking such a thing.

26:41.280 --> 26:45.790
Do you envisage tears, in addition
to the gnashing of my teeth?

26:45.840 --> 26:49.190
No, I envisage us putting
our best feet forward

26:49.240 --> 26:53.870
and approaching this appointment
in a positive and optimistic manner.

26:53.920 --> 26:57.670
I suggest you wear your black
veil, in case we want to pop

26:57.720 --> 27:02.760
into a nice little cafe I know of
on our way back from the hospital.

27:04.120 --> 27:06.430
It's called the Black Kettle Cafe

27:06.480 --> 27:09.320
and has quite the reputation
for its custard slices.

27:10.760 --> 27:12.590
Spit spot, Sister.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.800
Let's not keep Fred waiting.

27:18.160 --> 27:22.390
I am familiar with the strain

27:22.440 --> 27:25.240
that a baby can bring within a family.

27:26.760 --> 27:30.630
Not every baby is welcome or wanted.

27:30.680 --> 27:36.920
I have seen confusion, and distress
and heartbreak, in my time.

27:38.720 --> 27:40.760
I feel many things.

27:43.000 --> 27:46.310
But it is best that I do not discuss them.

27:46.360 --> 27:49.710
Parveen's child is not my child.

27:49.760 --> 27:52.640
And her pregnancy is not your pregnancy.

28:01.200 --> 28:03.880
I knew nothing of it, until she arrived.

28:06.840 --> 28:10.560
I knew nothing of the
wedding, until she arrived.

28:12.800 --> 28:17.350
Everything was decided by
others, and done by them.

28:17.400 --> 28:18.470
I am forced to accept,

28:18.520 --> 28:22.560
and accept, and accept.

28:24.520 --> 28:28.310
Just as I had to accept that
I would never have a baby.

28:28.360 --> 28:32.800
I am so very sorry that
you are in this situation.

28:41.480 --> 28:45.230
Oh, good morning, Mr Dockerill.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.990
Good morning, Nurse Crane.

28:48.040 --> 28:50.510
As nobody on these premises has expressed

28:50.560 --> 28:54.150
a desire for emergency
dental attention, might

28:54.200 --> 28:57.270
I presume that you've called because
you'd like to see Nurse Franklin?

28:57.320 --> 28:59.990
Yes. But I don't know
if she'd like to see me.

29:00.040 --> 29:02.400
She's on her rounds, as it happens.

29:03.560 --> 29:07.430
But please be advised that
what that young lass doesn't

29:07.480 --> 29:11.430
need at this precise moment in
time is a romance with a man who

29:11.480 --> 29:13.950
is effectively married.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.590
Trixie meant the world to me, Nurse Crane.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.550
And she still does.

29:18.600 --> 29:21.910
I will not do anything that
would distress, or hurt her.

29:21.960 --> 29:23.710
Good.

29:23.760 --> 29:26.360
Because what she does need is a friend.

29:29.680 --> 29:30.720
She is 15.

29:33.760 --> 29:35.960
I was 15 when I married
Saddiq, in Pakistan,

29:37.040 --> 29:40.040
and I can still recall
the terror that I felt.

29:41.640 --> 29:44.350
But he was hardly older than I was.

29:44.400 --> 29:47.230
You were children together.

29:47.280 --> 29:48.920
And we grew together.

29:50.360 --> 29:51.840
Grew up together.

29:53.760 --> 29:56.720
She has been forced to lie with
a man more than twice her age.

30:01.600 --> 30:06.960
Saddiq is a good man, and gentle.

30:08.640 --> 30:09.680
I know him.

30:12.280 --> 30:13.840
But she does not.

30:15.640 --> 30:16.800
I feel rage, and grief.

30:19.520 --> 30:21.870
For myself.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.440
And my marriage.

30:25.160 --> 30:30.070
And I do not see the child in front
of me, with an infant in her belly.

30:30.120 --> 30:31.790
I...

30:31.840 --> 30:34.400
.. think only of the children
that I can never have.

30:40.760 --> 30:43.720
And I despise myself!

30:46.040 --> 30:48.120
I do not.

30:50.920 --> 30:55.470
I will book Parveen into the
maternity home to have her baby.

30:55.520 --> 30:58.670
She will get excellent
care, and it will give you

30:58.720 --> 31:02.910
the chance to come to terms
with what is happening.

31:02.960 --> 31:05.240
I will never come to terms with it.

31:07.120 --> 31:08.680
And yet I must try.

31:11.560 --> 31:14.880
If you could remain as motionless
as possible it will assist me...

31:27.000 --> 31:30.510
Yes. You have bilateral cataracts
-- that is to say, one in each eye.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.750
They both require surgery.

31:33.800 --> 31:36.070
You must put me under the knife?

31:36.120 --> 31:38.550
Not the knife, Sister. The scalpel.

31:38.600 --> 31:43.150
It's a delicate surgery,
thoroughly tried and tested.

31:43.200 --> 31:45.510
And my understanding, Mr Greswell,

31:45.560 --> 31:48.070
is that general anaesthesia
would be deployed?

31:48.120 --> 31:49.310
Mmm-hmm. Of course.

31:49.360 --> 31:52.510
I can promise you, Sister, you
won't know a thing about it.

31:52.560 --> 31:54.830
One small scratch on
the back of your hand,

31:54.880 --> 31:56.070
you'll be away in fairyland.

31:56.120 --> 32:01.670
If you assume that an enforced
visit to an imaginary realm will

32:01.720 --> 32:07.030
reconcile me to your butchery,
sir, you are mistaken.

32:07.080 --> 32:09.990
Sister Monica Joan, I'm sure
Mr Greswell will be more than...

32:10.040 --> 32:12.390
It... It is not necessary for Mr Greswell

32:12.440 --> 32:15.920
and I to waste any more
of one another's time.

32:27.760 --> 32:32.230
Mr Greswell was remarkably
courteous, all things considered,

32:32.280 --> 32:35.390
and said he would leave Sister
Monica Joan on his waiting list.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.430
- But she remains intransigent?
- Yes.

32:38.480 --> 32:41.630
And she went straight to her
bedroom and slammed the door.

32:41.680 --> 32:44.870
I suspect I shall be leaving
this tea on the landing.

32:44.920 --> 32:48.070
But if she doesn't have the
operation, she will go blind.

32:48.120 --> 32:49.670
Quite.

32:49.720 --> 32:53.110
Will she have to go back to the Mother
House -- the one thing she's dreaded?

32:53.160 --> 32:54.870
If she is to lose her sight,

32:54.920 --> 32:58.510
it's best that she remains
somewhere familiar.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.320
And that we help to prepare her.

33:13.080 --> 33:16.590
You were right to bring Parveen
in -- her waters have broken,

33:16.640 --> 33:18.830
but her contractions are yet to start.

33:18.880 --> 33:20.670
She must come home?

33:20.720 --> 33:23.110
Given the situation, I think
it's best for us to keep

33:23.160 --> 33:25.030
her on the ward to monitor her progress.

33:25.080 --> 33:28.310
We can give her caster oil
to encourage the labour

33:28.360 --> 33:30.070
and hopefully we won't
have to wait too long.

33:30.120 --> 33:33.280
We will contact you as
soon as there is any news.

33:37.520 --> 33:40.560
I'm not convinced this
is fully showerproof.

33:41.560 --> 33:44.390
My offer of chauffeur
service still stands.

33:44.440 --> 33:45.430
Thank you, Phyllis.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.910
But taking the bus is part of my routine.

33:47.960 --> 33:50.310
If I can bag the top deck, front seat,

33:50.360 --> 33:52.630
left-hand side then it sets
me up for my entire evening.

33:52.680 --> 33:55.430
I can understand that.

33:55.480 --> 33:57.310
Off you pop.

33:57.360 --> 33:59.760
Get yourself back in the swing of it.

34:04.560 --> 34:06.990
Mr Gani, hello, It's Sister Julienne...

34:07.040 --> 34:08.909
from the Maternity Home.

34:08.960 --> 34:11.310
Parveen's contractions have begun.

34:11.360 --> 34:15.070
Young mothers often labour
very quickly, so if you...

34:15.120 --> 34:16.840
and Mrs Gani would like to come in?

34:18.880 --> 34:21.790
Thank you.

34:21.840 --> 34:23.760
The baby's coming.

34:33.000 --> 34:35.320
Shall we gather round,
ladies and gentlemen?

34:40.960 --> 34:43.510
Are you joining us?

34:43.560 --> 34:45.710
Not this evening.

34:45.760 --> 34:48.150
You're doing really well.

34:48.199 --> 34:50.320
Good girl, good girl...

34:56.639 --> 34:58.510
Parveen,

34:58.560 --> 35:01.160
Parveen. Mumtaz is here...

35:03.120 --> 35:06.870
You timed it perfectly
-- Baby's almost here.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.790
What do I...

35:08.840 --> 35:10.590
What can I do?

35:10.640 --> 35:13.080
Help her by talking in Punjabi.

35:18.680 --> 35:20.990
The head's about to be born.

35:21.040 --> 35:24.390
We need to take this slowly, Parveen...

35:24.440 --> 35:26.470
Parveen very slow...

35:26.520 --> 35:30.030
Sirr aavnda peya, tu aistaa kar.

35:30.080 --> 35:32.510
Don't push too hard.

35:32.560 --> 35:33.680
Zyaadaa zorr naa laa.

35:37.520 --> 35:40.040
Encourage her. She's doing really well.

35:41.440 --> 35:45.510
Haa edhaa! Tu acha karr ree hai, Parveen.

35:45.560 --> 35:46.600
Tu karr sakh ni a!

35:47.840 --> 35:49.230
The head is coming.

35:49.280 --> 35:50.790
Tu karr sakh ni a, shabash!

35:50.840 --> 35:53.950
You're doing so well.

35:54.000 --> 35:56.110
Sirf mohnday 'un.

35:56.160 --> 35:58.000
Fair thoo zoor lagaa.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.120
Well done! Well done!

36:06.520 --> 36:08.120
You have a little boy, Parveen!

36:10.520 --> 36:12.560
You have a son!

36:17.800 --> 36:20.040
You have a boy?

36:23.360 --> 36:24.960
He's so beautiful...

36:27.560 --> 36:30.360
And you are very, very clever.

36:38.000 --> 36:39.040
Look at his fingers!

36:41.600 --> 36:43.240
And his hair...

36:45.240 --> 36:47.630
Look at what you have done.

36:47.680 --> 36:48.720
You did it also.

36:50.640 --> 36:52.840
You helped me.

37:00.880 --> 37:03.830
Looks like you dodged the
worst of the rain, then?

37:03.880 --> 37:06.160
Yes. I got off very lightly.

38:17.200 --> 38:20.670
Salaam mera beta.

38:20.720 --> 38:22.800
A son.

38:24.120 --> 38:25.160
My son.

38:29.440 --> 38:31.440
Our son.

38:47.440 --> 38:50.510
I telephoned the Royal
Institute for the Blind

38:50.560 --> 38:53.110
and spoke to an
exceptionally helpful lady.

38:53.160 --> 38:56.510
There are a great many things
on offer to people whose sight

38:56.560 --> 38:57.670
is failing.

38:57.720 --> 39:01.320
In due course, you may wish
to consider a white stick.

39:03.960 --> 39:07.240
We can put that notion to
one side for the time being.

39:08.600 --> 39:11.830
But without the surgery,
you are going to have to

39:11.880 --> 39:15.120
prepare for a future where
things are very different.

39:18.320 --> 39:21.870
The lady suggested you might
start learning Braille.

39:21.920 --> 39:26.640
I managed to pick up some books
for beginners, from the library.

39:32.160 --> 39:35.280
You love books so much,
Sister Monica Joan.

39:36.320 --> 39:39.630
And many of the great works
are printed in Braille,

39:39.680 --> 39:42.760
so once you've mastered it, you
can read them in translation.

39:44.960 --> 39:48.200
It seems that I am in translation now.

39:49.400 --> 39:50.920
Transmuted.

39:52.320 --> 39:53.360
Altered.

39:55.600 --> 39:56.640
Metamorphosed.

39:58.600 --> 40:00.520
Oh, Sister...

40:02.640 --> 40:05.320
There are other words for my condition.

40:08.440 --> 40:10.760
But I can't recall them now.

40:19.920 --> 40:21.070
Christopher.

40:21.120 --> 40:24.350
What an unexpected pleasure.

40:24.400 --> 40:27.590
Sorry. Would you have preferred
it if I'd called first?

40:27.640 --> 40:28.840
Not really.

40:35.280 --> 40:40.910
I was about to remind you there are rules
about kissing in the vicinity of this doorstep.

40:40.960 --> 40:43.360
Well, it can't matter,
surely, if we're just friends.

40:44.800 --> 40:47.190
No. I don't suppose it can.

40:47.240 --> 40:49.070
How's Alexandra?

40:49.120 --> 40:51.110
Doing better.

40:51.160 --> 40:52.750
I'm seeing a bit more of the old sparkle.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.360
Oh, I'm so glad.

40:58.280 --> 41:02.550
She got a gold star in her essay
entitled "My Rabbit", and wants me

41:02.600 --> 41:05.630
to show it to you when she's allowed
to bring her exercise book home.

41:05.680 --> 41:07.950
I'd love to see it.

41:08.000 --> 41:10.000
Even if it means seeing me too?

41:17.560 --> 41:21.910
I don't want to do anything that
adds to your unhappiness, Trixie.

41:21.960 --> 41:25.470
- Who told you I was unhappy?
- A little bird. Well...

41:25.520 --> 41:26.750
Phyllis?

41:26.800 --> 41:28.190
A slightly bigger bird, admittedly.

41:28.240 --> 41:30.870
But a very concerned, and caring one.

41:30.920 --> 41:34.030
She had no right discussing my
personal business with anyone.

41:34.080 --> 41:35.120
Trixie.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.040
I care too.

41:49.600 --> 41:52.150
Oh, sorry, Sister.

41:52.200 --> 41:54.950
I didn't mean to interrupt you.

41:55.000 --> 41:58.550
These flowers were going
spare from the allotment,

41:58.600 --> 42:02.790
Sister Winifred said to leave
them in here for the altar.

42:02.840 --> 42:05.560
Not much scent, for a hybrid tea.

42:06.600 --> 42:08.470
They are roses?

42:08.520 --> 42:09.840
Yeah.

42:13.160 --> 42:18.240
My mother was intensely
fond of her rose garden.

42:21.160 --> 42:24.000
She taught me the name of every bloom.

42:25.520 --> 42:26.560
Zephyrine Drouet.

42:30.600 --> 42:34.080
Souvenir de Malmaison.

42:36.680 --> 42:38.120
La Reine.

42:40.560 --> 42:41.750
I don't know what these are.

42:41.800 --> 42:47.630
Other than prone to mildew
and a bit on the thorny side.

42:47.680 --> 42:50.910
If I were in a more jocular cast of mind,

42:50.960 --> 42:54.630
I might say the same about myself.

42:54.680 --> 42:57.960
But you're feeling a little bit
out of sorts, aren't you, Sister?

42:59.560 --> 43:02.960
I can scarcely see that
they are flowers at all.

43:11.240 --> 43:13.270
I don't drink all the time.

43:13.320 --> 43:18.360
I have rules, and -- by and
large -- I stick to them.

43:19.600 --> 43:21.440
You know how self-disciplined I am.

43:23.680 --> 43:27.430
And I know how brave you are,

43:27.480 --> 43:30.520
and how fragile, how proud.

43:32.080 --> 43:36.030
And I know you'll do everything you
possibly can alone, before you ask for help.

43:36.080 --> 43:37.600
I'm not asking for help.

43:40.840 --> 43:42.520
But you need it.

43:46.280 --> 43:47.950
Yes.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.720
I do.

43:55.600 --> 43:58.360
Thank you for allowing me to say that.

44:03.760 --> 44:08.200
When I first took the veil, I fought it.

44:09.320 --> 44:12.390
I performed the tasks required,

44:12.440 --> 44:16.270
but inside I resisted every rule

44:16.320 --> 44:20.510
and questioned every regulation.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.550
Well, that's human nature, isn't it?

44:23.600 --> 44:24.640
It was my nature.

44:27.240 --> 44:29.080
And still is.

44:30.200 --> 44:33.470
I could always hear God's voice,

44:33.520 --> 44:37.240
I was merely reluctant to
let Him have the final word.

44:39.120 --> 44:44.950
Sister Monica Joan, if you
don't have this operation,

44:45.000 --> 44:47.320
He will have the last word.

44:48.480 --> 44:51.790
And you will lose your
eyesight altogether.

44:51.840 --> 44:53.840
But if that is what He intends?

44:59.320 --> 45:06.150
The greatest lesson I learned from
the religious life was acceptance.

45:06.200 --> 45:11.640
It was hard but supremely worthwhile.

45:13.640 --> 45:16.190
I should perhaps not abnegate it now --

45:16.240 --> 45:17.280
but instead...

45:21.840 --> 45:26.720
.. surrender to blindness.

45:28.120 --> 45:33.670
If you submit to blindness then
you'll be throwing all sorts

45:33.720 --> 45:36.350
back in to God's face!

45:36.400 --> 45:38.760
Will you e... explain
your meaning. If you can.

45:39.960 --> 45:41.950
Well...

45:42.000 --> 45:44.510
People trying to help
you. You're rejecting that.

45:44.560 --> 45:48.240
Medical science can help you.
You're rejecting that, too! And...

45:49.480 --> 45:54.190
And if you believe that
God created the world then

45:54.240 --> 45:57.590
He made all of those things possible

45:57.640 --> 46:02.560
and I would be a little bit fed up
with you, if I was the man upstairs.

46:03.680 --> 46:07.280
"The man upstairs" knows my reasoning.

46:08.880 --> 46:13.400
In which case, he also
knows you're scared.

46:28.280 --> 46:30.440
We all get scared, Sister.

46:32.000 --> 46:34.360
I was scared at El Alamein.

46:36.680 --> 46:39.310
I bet that lady astronaut was scared,

46:39.360 --> 46:41.480
when they put her in her rocket.

46:42.520 --> 46:46.000
Think of all the things
that she's seeing now.

47:05.120 --> 47:08.430
I have decided to suffer
the surgeon's knife.

47:08.480 --> 47:10.270
Really?

47:10.320 --> 47:12.800
If an ingenue of 26 can
travel through the earth's

47:14.160 --> 47:16.350
atmosphere at orbital velocity,

47:16.400 --> 47:20.990
then a woman as ancient as myself

47:21.040 --> 47:24.270
can face her fear of the scalpel.

47:24.320 --> 47:25.990
Sister Monica Joan.

47:26.040 --> 47:29.750
Having a cataract operation
really isn't comparable to

47:29.800 --> 47:31.030
going into space.

47:31.080 --> 47:35.710
I look upon the astronaut, and
myself, as Brides of Science.

47:35.760 --> 47:39.840
And courteously invite you to do likewise.

47:56.480 --> 47:58.630
I'd come in with you if it were allowed.

47:58.680 --> 48:03.110
But instead I'll sit tight
here until you're finished.

48:03.160 --> 48:04.800
All right.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.230
I managed to pull some
strings and lo and behold

48:27.280 --> 48:30.870
Sister Monica Joan's name is
on the cancellations list!

48:30.920 --> 48:32.590
Thank you.

48:32.640 --> 48:36.310
Time is of the essence, lest she
should change her mind again.

48:36.360 --> 48:38.720
She has changed it once already...

48:39.760 --> 48:41.920
How did you get her to agree?

48:43.120 --> 48:46.080
It would appear that the
credit should go to Fred.

48:52.640 --> 48:54.390
Is that Baby Gani?

48:54.440 --> 48:55.950
Yes.

48:56.000 --> 49:00.030
Sadly Mother still isn't
interested in feeding him herself.

49:00.080 --> 49:03.070
I almost wish I'd encouraged a home birth.

49:03.120 --> 49:04.830
With less support from us,

49:04.880 --> 49:08.310
Parveen might have been more
inclined to engage with him.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.350
What about the other Mrs Gani?

49:10.400 --> 49:13.040
It's such a very delicate situation.

49:31.160 --> 49:33.590
Mrs Gani. Hello.

49:33.640 --> 49:35.190
What are you doing here?

49:35.240 --> 49:37.670
I just came to speak
to you about the baby.

49:37.720 --> 49:39.350
Please go.

49:39.400 --> 49:41.200
It is not my child.

49:44.040 --> 49:45.870
I know how hard this is for you Mrs Gani

49:45.920 --> 49:48.670
but he's so little.

49:48.720 --> 49:50.630
He needs all the love he can get.

49:50.680 --> 49:54.200
I said go. Please.

50:01.080 --> 50:03.310
Mrs Gani? Oh, goodness.

50:03.360 --> 50:05.760
- Leave me.
- Let me take a look.

50:07.640 --> 50:09.840
I'll call Doctor Turner.

50:26.800 --> 50:29.310
I know what's said in there is private,

50:29.360 --> 50:33.040
but did anything help tonight?

50:34.280 --> 50:35.510
In a way.

50:35.560 --> 50:37.670
Then why do you look so sad?

50:37.720 --> 50:39.880
Because I realised something.

50:41.720 --> 50:44.960
We can't keep seeing
each other, Christopher.

50:48.040 --> 50:50.030
But I want to help.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.350
I don't think you can.

50:52.400 --> 50:56.200
Just because we're not together,
doesn't mean I don't care any more.

50:58.760 --> 51:01.510
- I still...
- I know.

51:01.560 --> 51:02.840
And I still do too.

51:04.120 --> 51:08.150
But that's precisely why this can't go on.

51:08.200 --> 51:09.920
You have to look to your future.

51:11.000 --> 51:13.430
And I have to look to mine.

51:13.480 --> 51:16.800
God willing, there's a lot of
life left to live for both of us.

51:22.560 --> 51:24.280
Goodnight.

51:25.320 --> 51:26.920
Take care of yourself, Trixie.

51:34.760 --> 51:36.990
You should make a full recovery,

51:37.040 --> 51:41.550
although I'd keep up the
painkillers for a day or two.

51:41.600 --> 51:43.550
Drink this.

51:43.600 --> 51:46.040
- It's been well sugared.
- Thank you.

51:47.400 --> 51:49.840
You have taken care of me very well.

51:51.800 --> 51:54.110
I heard you speak of the baby.

51:54.160 --> 51:56.110
Is he unwell?

51:56.160 --> 51:57.510
Not unwell.

51:57.560 --> 51:59.400
Just a little unsettled.

52:00.520 --> 52:04.590
Perhaps because motherhood
isn't proving easy for Parveen.

52:04.640 --> 52:07.710
How can motherhood be
hard? She's given birth.

52:07.760 --> 52:10.990
Her body has prepared her.

52:11.040 --> 52:14.510
Motherhood is about so much more
than a physical process, Mrs Gani.

52:14.560 --> 52:15.830
Well,

52:15.880 --> 52:18.840
I don't know any more
about that than you do.

52:19.920 --> 52:23.840
I think we all know more about
love than we might realise.

52:24.920 --> 52:28.440
I'm a doctor, but I'm a father too.

52:29.640 --> 52:34.310
I have a son to my late first
wife, an adopted daughter,

52:34.360 --> 52:37.510
and a little boy who was
born after my second wife

52:37.560 --> 52:41.390
and I had given up all hope of
ever having a baby of our own.

52:41.440 --> 52:43.550
For you, the miracle happened.

52:43.600 --> 52:44.630
Yes.

52:44.680 --> 52:48.310
But the miracle wasn't
that a child was born.

52:48.360 --> 52:52.880
It was that my wife and I had found
ways to embrace what we were given.

52:53.960 --> 52:57.430
We built a family out of
several disparate elements,

52:57.480 --> 53:01.520
and at least one major surprise.

53:04.320 --> 53:06.120
Is it a happy family?

53:07.120 --> 53:08.430
Yes.

53:08.480 --> 53:09.520
It is.

53:11.080 --> 53:14.070
Not necessarily average.

53:14.120 --> 53:16.080
And a bit chaotic sometimes.

53:17.360 --> 53:19.280
But it works very nicely.

53:21.880 --> 53:27.550
So you are saying that I must
embrace what I am given...?

53:27.600 --> 53:30.280
We are saying if you can
open your heart to Parveen...

53:33.120 --> 53:37.710
.. then maybe you can find
a way you can all thrive.

53:37.760 --> 53:39.920
The baby most especially.

53:46.240 --> 53:48.310
Phyllis?

53:48.360 --> 53:50.120
Yes, lass?

53:51.400 --> 53:53.150
I'm sorry.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.990
Oh, lass! What for?

53:56.040 --> 54:00.670
For putting you in such a difficult
position with Sister Julienne.

54:00.720 --> 54:03.070
For being less than honest with you,

54:03.120 --> 54:06.150
when you deserve nothing
less than the truth.

54:06.200 --> 54:08.280
And for not turning up for duty tomorrow.

54:11.160 --> 54:15.430
Because I'm going to have to turn my
attention to something very pressing,

54:15.480 --> 54:17.480
that means going away for a while.

54:21.600 --> 54:26.430
I'm not one for biblical
quotations and well you know it.

54:26.480 --> 54:30.350
But my mother always used to
say, "Sufficient unto the day is

54:30.400 --> 54:32.950
"the evil thereof".

54:33.000 --> 54:38.750
Which is just another way of saying
you can start afresh in the morning.

54:38.800 --> 54:40.950
And you can.

54:41.000 --> 54:42.640
I promise you.

55:08.640 --> 55:10.790
Oh, Mrs Gani!

55:10.840 --> 55:14.430
I was about to take Baby through
to the Nursery for his bottle.

55:14.480 --> 55:16.760
You aren't feeding him yourself?

55:17.800 --> 55:19.400
It's too hard...

55:21.760 --> 55:25.630
I can remember my grandmother
telling me "To feed the baby,

55:25.680 --> 55:29.710
"one must feed the mother."

55:29.760 --> 55:32.000
Let's get you something to eat, hm?

55:40.120 --> 55:42.470
You asked to see me, Nurse Franklin.

55:42.520 --> 55:44.800
- Yes, I did.
- And I'm glad.

55:46.320 --> 55:50.680
Because if you hadn't, I would
have been forced to ask to see you.

55:52.280 --> 55:55.510
I can do better than
this, Sister Julienne.

55:55.560 --> 55:57.350
I believe you can.

55:57.400 --> 55:59.400
And we both know that you must.

56:02.560 --> 56:05.990
I'm granting you leave
of absence for six months,

56:06.040 --> 56:09.070
to enable you to seek
help for your problems.

56:09.120 --> 56:13.240
Once you are yourself again,
you may return to your position.

56:14.400 --> 56:16.990
You go with our love.

56:17.040 --> 56:18.760
And our prayers.

56:37.400 --> 56:40.990
Sometimes one small gesture...

56:41.040 --> 56:44.400
can give us the strength
to do enormous things.

56:45.760 --> 56:50.190
A little generosity can
unleash great tenderness

56:50.240 --> 56:53.400
leading in time to deep real love.

57:04.400 --> 57:08.800
And a single conversation can
change your mind, a life.

57:09.880 --> 57:13.640
The world is no bigger than
the people who inhabit it.

57:15.400 --> 57:20.520
And together or alone we
are closer than we know.

57:24.760 --> 57:28.150
It seems he may have been
suffering from smallpox.

57:28.200 --> 57:30.950
I need help. But you
must keep it a secret.

57:31.000 --> 57:33.990
You said you didn't want any
balloons or a welcoming committee.

57:34.040 --> 57:36.470
That's why we didn't tell
them we were coming home.

57:36.520 --> 57:38.550
She's suffering such anguish --

57:38.600 --> 57:40.750
so terrified of another
forceps delivery that

57:40.800 --> 57:42.510
she doesn't want to give birth.

57:42.560 --> 57:45.360
- Eunice! - I'm not doing
it, Kenny. I can't...
