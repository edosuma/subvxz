01:12:50.117 --> 01:12:51.368
not even when I was nine.

01:12:52.077 --> 01:12:52.911
But then you started to sing

01:12:53.078 --> 01:12:54.288
and they all loved you.

01:12:54.538 --> 01:12:55.956
[Selena laughs]

01:12:58.041 --> 01:13:01.003
[sentimental music]

01:13:01.503 --> 01:13:03.046
You know, sometimes I think about

01:13:03.547 --> 01:13:04.965
the things I never had.

01:13:07.384 --> 01:13:09.761
Like, I guess I never had
a normal childhood.

01:13:10.178 --> 01:13:12.264
You know,
'cause I finished high school by mail.

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:16.226
I've spent more time in Big Bertha

01:13:16.393 --> 01:13:17.853
than I have anywhere else.

01:13:19.938 --> 01:13:21.648
But when I was on that stage...

01:13:24.276 --> 01:13:26.236
that was like nothing I ever felt before.

01:13:28.530 --> 01:13:31.116
It's hard to describe,
I just had this feeling, like...

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:35.704
my dreams were the same as the dreams

01:13:35.871 --> 01:13:38.290
of all those people who were out
there in the audience.

01:13:39.541 --> 01:13:41.543
[Selena] Like all their hopes
were centered on me.

01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.757
And I just felt lucky.

01:13:50.052 --> 01:13:51.428
I felt really lucky.

01:13:54.890 --> 01:13:56.475
I know why they all love you so much.

01:13:56.892 --> 01:13:58.310
Oh, yeah? Why?

01:14:01.939 --> 01:14:03.231
Because I love you, too.

01:14:05.817 --> 01:14:06.693
I mean it.

01:14:07.444 --> 01:14:08.654
You're the best friend
that I've ever had.

01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:09.821
I can talk to you about anything

01:14:09.988 --> 01:14:11.198
and you always understand.

01:14:12.866 --> 01:14:14.451
I thought a lot about
what you said to me

01:14:14.618 --> 01:14:16.453
that night in LA,
out by the dumpsters.

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:19.957
And I don't want to be that dumb.

01:14:20.374 --> 01:14:21.750
I don't want to lose you.

01:14:24.252 --> 01:14:25.504
I don't want to lose you, either.

01:14:27.839 --> 01:14:30.008
When I was five years old
and my parents split up...

01:14:32.344 --> 01:14:33.553
not a day has gone by

01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:35.764
that I haven't remembered
the feeling that I had that day

01:14:35.931 --> 01:14:37.599
I knew my father
wasn't coming back.

01:14:39.101 --> 01:14:41.103
- Chris.
- Until I met you.

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:43.897
And I don't feel like that anymore.

01:14:44.064 --> 01:14:46.775
[romantic music]

01:14:47.651 --> 01:14:48.568
I love you.

01:14:49.695 --> 01:14:50.737
I love you, too.

01:15:18.515 --> 01:15:21.393
[indistinct chatter]

01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:30.193
Hey, you know,
I got a surprise for you in the back.

01:15:30.694 --> 01:15:31.987
- You do?
- Yeah. You want to go see it?

01:15:32.154 --> 01:15:33.113
- Yeah.
- Okay. Come on.

01:15:34.698 --> 01:15:36.491
Hold on. Wait for me!

01:15:40.370 --> 01:15:41.163
Ta-da!

01:15:41.329 --> 01:15:43.373
Oh, look. How cute!

01:15:43.540 --> 01:15:45.208
- [Chris laughs]
- Thank you.

01:15:56.511 --> 01:15:57.304
[brakes hiss]

01:15:57.804 --> 01:15:59.806
All right.
Everybody off the bus.

01:16:00.348 --> 01:16:01.975
- What's going on?
- Get off the bus.

01:16:02.601 --> 01:16:04.770
Get off. Everyone.
You stay in. You stay in.

01:16:04.936 --> 01:16:05.771
Get off.

01:16:08.273 --> 01:16:10.400
- This is over right now.
- What do you mean, Dad?

01:16:10.567 --> 01:16:12.402
This. You and him. It's over.

01:16:12.569 --> 01:16:14.654
Abraham, you can't tell us what to do.

01:16:14.821 --> 01:16:16.281
I can tell you anything
I want to tell you!

01:16:16.448 --> 01:16:17.491
You don't think
I know who you are?

01:16:17.657 --> 01:16:18.867
I come from the streets.

01:16:19.409 --> 01:16:20.786
I know what a bum musician is!

01:16:20.952 --> 01:16:22.245
Dad, don't talk to him like that!

01:16:22.412 --> 01:16:24.456
I can say anything
I want to say to him!

01:16:25.540 --> 01:16:27.667
I'm not gonna have this in my family.

01:16:28.126 --> 01:16:29.628
Now let's just get one thing straight.

01:16:30.045 --> 01:16:31.713
You're not to see
each other like this again.

01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:33.340
I'm not agreeing to anything.

01:16:33.715 --> 01:16:35.467
Okay, you can't tell me
who I can and can't see.

01:16:35.634 --> 01:16:36.843
Selena! You wait!

01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:39.679
You're gonna ruin your career!
You're gonna ruin your life!

01:16:39.846 --> 01:16:41.890
You're only 20 years old.
Give yourself some time.

01:16:42.057 --> 01:16:43.517
Dad, I don't care what you say.

01:16:43.683 --> 01:16:46.311
It doesn't matter, okay?
I love him, and that's it!

01:16:46.478 --> 01:16:47.395
What did you say?

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:50.273
I said, I love him.

01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:52.484
And he loves me, too.

01:16:52.734 --> 01:16:53.902
Of course, he does.

01:16:54.277 --> 01:16:56.113
You're young, you're beautiful,
and you're rich!

01:16:56.571 --> 01:16:57.781
Yeah, you would say that!

01:16:58.782 --> 01:16:59.991
It's not like that.

01:17:01.118 --> 01:17:02.577
He cares about me.

01:17:03.787 --> 01:17:04.830
The real me...

01:17:05.330 --> 01:17:06.373
inside.

01:17:07.541 --> 01:17:08.792
And there is no way

01:17:09.543 --> 01:17:11.128
I'm gonna let you take that away.

01:17:12.295 --> 01:17:14.506
Abraham, we're not gonna
stop seeing each other.

01:17:14.673 --> 01:17:15.882
Now you listen to me!

01:17:16.883 --> 01:17:19.344
If you think I'm gonna allow you
to come in and mess up my family,

01:17:19.594 --> 01:17:21.930
ruin everything that we've worked for,
you're wrong!

01:17:22.180 --> 01:17:24.474
I respect your family and
I don't wanna ruin anything.

01:17:24.975 --> 01:17:26.726
I love Selena and
we wanna get married.

01:17:32.941 --> 01:17:34.609
That's right, Dad.
We wanna get married.

01:17:38.155 --> 01:17:41.908
That's it!
You're fired! Do you hear me?

01:17:42.367 --> 01:17:44.077
You can ride back to Corpus Christi,

01:17:44.244 --> 01:17:45.453
but after that, you're fired!

01:17:45.620 --> 01:17:47.205
That's okay.
I can make my own way.

01:17:47.539 --> 01:17:49.708
- You cannot do this, Dad!
- Selena!

01:17:49.875 --> 01:17:51.459
[Selena]
Dad, I'm not gonna let you do this!

01:17:51.626 --> 01:17:52.544
Let me go!

01:17:53.879 --> 01:17:54.963
You listen to me.

01:17:55.505 --> 01:17:56.631
You all listen to me.

01:17:57.883 --> 01:17:59.134
If you follow that man,

01:17:59.718 --> 01:18:00.844
I will disband the group.

01:18:01.011 --> 01:18:03.388
[Abraham]
There will be no more <i>Selena y Los Dinos.</i>

01:18:03.638 --> 01:18:05.182
Do you understand me?

01:18:05.682 --> 01:18:07.142
Do you all understand me?

01:18:09.019 --> 01:18:09.895
It's over!

01:18:16.443 --> 01:18:19.321
[crying]

01:18:20.822 --> 01:18:22.866
<i>Mija,</i> your father is right.

01:18:23.575 --> 01:18:25.327
You're too young to get married.

01:18:25.827 --> 01:18:27.162
You and Dad were just as young

01:18:27.329 --> 01:18:28.413
when you got married.

01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:29.372
Younger.

01:18:30.957 --> 01:18:32.834
[Marcela]
It was different back then, Selena.

01:18:33.501 --> 01:18:34.836
What was so different?

01:18:35.253 --> 01:18:37.172
I was the daughter
of poor farm workers.

01:18:37.339 --> 01:18:39.090
We didn't have any choices.

01:18:39.591 --> 01:18:41.676
In those days,
there was no other way.

01:18:41.927 --> 01:18:42.510
Yeah.

01:18:44.554 --> 01:18:46.306
But you and Dad
have been happy, right?

01:18:46.473 --> 01:18:48.350
Yes. Yes.

01:18:48.683 --> 01:18:50.435
I love your father very much.

01:18:51.645 --> 01:18:54.189
But I wanted something different
for my daughters.

01:18:55.315 --> 01:18:56.983
A chance to see things,

01:18:57.692 --> 01:18:59.027
to live, <i>mija.</i>

01:18:59.611 --> 01:19:02.030
Look, <i>mija,</i> just wait a few years.

01:19:02.197 --> 01:19:03.490
- [sniffs]
- Okay?

01:19:04.282 --> 01:19:06.409
I know it seems like forever to you now,

01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.579
but believe me, it's the right thing.

01:19:11.289 --> 01:19:12.624
But I love him, Mom.

01:19:16.002 --> 01:19:17.128
I love him.

01:19:21.299 --> 01:19:22.259
[Marcela]
It's okay.

01:19:30.642 --> 01:19:33.520
[accordion music]

01:19:38.692 --> 01:19:40.360
- Selena!
- Selena!

01:19:40.527 --> 01:19:42.737
- Selena! Selena!
- Selena!

01:19:42.904 --> 01:19:46.825
[all]
Selena! Selena! Selena!

01:19:46.992 --> 01:19:48.410
Selena!

01:19:48.576 --> 01:19:51.288
[seagulls squawking]

01:19:54.165 --> 01:19:55.208
[Selena]
I hate this.

01:19:55.750 --> 01:19:57.460
Can't even go
into a burger joint with you

01:19:57.627 --> 01:19:59.087
without worrying about
somebody seeing us

01:19:59.254 --> 01:20:00.505
and it getting back to Dad.

01:20:01.715 --> 01:20:03.925
Can you pass me the hot sauce?
It's in the glove compartment.

01:20:05.677 --> 01:20:07.220
Don't worry about it.
Just give it some time.

01:20:07.887 --> 01:20:09.097
Where are you guys heading next?

01:20:09.514 --> 01:20:10.307
I don't know.

01:20:11.474 --> 01:20:13.852
El Paso tomorrow. Some big gig.

01:20:15.061 --> 01:20:17.063
And they keep me busy between gigs, too.

01:20:17.230 --> 01:20:19.357
Like today, I have to go to
the water park with Sara.

01:20:20.108 --> 01:20:22.068
I mean, I have to talk fast
just to go shopping alone.

01:20:22.235 --> 01:20:23.862
[chuckles]
And you're here with me.

01:20:24.362 --> 01:20:25.572
[Selena laughs]

01:20:26.990 --> 01:20:28.575
You know, he keeps saying
he'll break up the band

01:20:28.742 --> 01:20:30.577
if we keep seeing each other.

01:20:31.453 --> 01:20:33.330
But so what?
I mean, I can do other things.

01:20:34.831 --> 01:20:35.832
You know, I could design clothes.

01:20:35.999 --> 01:20:37.083
I've always wanted to do that.

01:20:38.335 --> 01:20:39.878
Sel, you don't want to quit music.

01:20:41.713 --> 01:20:42.422
No.

01:20:43.256 --> 01:20:45.633
And making it to the big time,
that's really important to you.

01:20:46.301 --> 01:20:47.385
[sighs]

01:20:48.136 --> 01:20:50.513
I mean, being big in Mexico
and doing that whole

01:20:50.930 --> 01:20:52.265
English crossover thing.

01:20:53.391 --> 01:20:54.726
[Chris] Remember when you told me
that you felt like

01:20:54.893 --> 01:20:56.853
everybody's hopes
and dreams were centered on you?

01:20:57.604 --> 01:20:58.772
That means a lot to you, doesn't it?

01:21:00.065 --> 01:21:00.732
It does.

01:21:03.109 --> 01:21:04.235
And what if they're right?

01:21:05.236 --> 01:21:06.613
You know,
about us getting married?

01:21:06.946 --> 01:21:09.324
I mean, they feel like
it's gonna hurt the act,

01:21:09.491 --> 01:21:10.492
not just Abraham.

01:21:10.742 --> 01:21:12.911
Abie, Ricky, Pete, Joe, Suzy...

01:21:13.828 --> 01:21:15.080
they all think like that.

01:21:26.257 --> 01:21:27.550
[kids screaming]

01:21:29.886 --> 01:21:32.222
Let's go do that Velcro
thing over there.

01:21:32.389 --> 01:21:35.058
- Yeah, looks good.
- What, the spider web thing?

01:21:35.809 --> 01:21:37.894
- That one over there.
- Oh, yeah. That's cool!

01:21:38.061 --> 01:21:39.813
- [overlapping chatter]
- We could all do it together.

01:21:39.979 --> 01:21:40.688
How 'bout that?

01:21:43.233 --> 01:21:45.068
[man]
Oh, Sel, you're so full of it.

01:21:45.235 --> 01:21:47.862
- [Selena] Right. Come on, dare me.
- [man] You wouldn't do that, no way.

01:21:48.029 --> 01:21:49.948
- I double-dog dare you.
- Don't dare her.

01:21:50.698 --> 01:21:53.201
Sel, I'm just kidding.
Sel! Sel!

01:21:53.910 --> 01:21:55.370
Selena, what are you doing?

01:21:55.537 --> 01:21:56.746
You shouldn't have dared me.

01:21:58.623 --> 01:22:01.501
- [woman] You can still get off.
- Selena, come on.

01:22:02.335 --> 01:22:03.711
[Suzette]
This isn't funny.

01:22:04.379 --> 01:22:05.797
Come on down right now.

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:07.966
- What are you doing?
- This is not funny!

01:22:08.383 --> 01:22:10.301
Selena, nobody's laughing!

01:22:10.468 --> 01:22:11.970
- [man] Get down here!
- [Suzette] Ha-ha!

01:22:12.137 --> 01:22:14.556
Selena!

01:22:15.223 --> 01:22:16.766
Selena!

01:22:17.475 --> 01:22:20.687
[instrumental music]

01:22:27.235 --> 01:22:29.070
[man] You know, if you look down,
you're not gonna do it.

01:22:29.863 --> 01:22:31.614
- Step back.
- [gate creaking open]

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:34.659
Right hand on this side,
left hand on the other side.

01:22:38.413 --> 01:22:40.373
Come on, the hardest part is letting go.

01:23:05.857 --> 01:23:07.442
[knock on door]

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:12.906
- What are you doing here?
- I've had it, Chris.

01:23:13.490 --> 01:23:15.283
I've had it.
I can't take it anymore. That's it.

01:23:15.450 --> 01:23:17.035
- I've made up my mind.
- El Paso is 12 hours away.

01:23:17.202 --> 01:23:18.244
You're supposed to be
getting on that bus.

01:23:18.411 --> 01:23:19.579
I don't care about El Paso.

01:23:19.746 --> 01:23:21.873
You mean more to me
than any gig in El Paso.

If you're not in El Paso,

01:23:23.041 --> 01:23:24.167
your father's gonna know
that you're here.

01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:26.961
Let him know! Let him, okay?

01:23:27.212 --> 01:23:29.464
- I'm tired of hiding from him!
- I'm tired, too.

01:23:29.631 --> 01:23:31.341
But everything's gonna get messed up
this way.

01:23:31.508 --> 01:23:32.884

Forever. You're it for me.

01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.861
So let's just do it.
Let's just get married right now.

01:23:52.862 --> 01:23:53.738
Married?

01:23:54.531 --> 01:23:55.740
That's, that's--that's crazy.

You don't want to marry me?

01:23:57.325 --> 01:23:58.785
Of course I want to marry you

01:23:59.494 --> 01:24:00.828

a beautiful white dress

01:24:12.131 --> 01:24:14.592
Yeah, bridesmaids,
and lots of flowers

01:24:14.759 --> 01:24:15.927

01:24:17.804 --> 01:24:19.222
It's not the important thing.

No matter what you say,
I know how important it is to you

01:24:21.891 --> 01:24:23.685
to have your family there
when you're getting married.

01:24:24.686 --> 01:24:26.104
And it's important to me, too,

01:24:26.437 --> 01:24:27.689

And he will never accept us.

01:25:12.275 --> 01:25:13.901
Never! All right?

01:25:14.402 --> 01:25:16.279
He's dug his heels in,
and that's it!

The whole world,
all of Corpus Christi

could come tumbling down
on his head

01:25:20.325 --> 01:25:21.743
and he would not budge!

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:24.746
The only way he will know

01:25:24.912 --> 01:25:26.873
that I am not gonna give you up...

01:25:28.166 --> 01:25:30.418
is if we go out
and get married right now.

01:25:33.671 --> 01:25:35.173
Then he'll have to accept us.

01:25:36.966 --> 01:25:38.259
But what if he doesn't?

01:25:39.302 --> 01:25:40.887
Well, I'll still have you.

01:25:43.514 --> 01:25:44.807

[Selena]
Uh, probably about another month.

01:44:25.343 --> 01:44:27.763
<i>Tú sabes.</i>
And she's been so great.

01:44:28.263 --> 01:44:30.807
Everybody's chipped in,
and we're gonna get her a present.

01:44:31.057 --> 01:44:32.434
A ring from all of us.

01:44:32.642 --> 01:44:34.311
Would you like to chip in, too, Yolanda?

01:44:34.478 --> 01:44:36.438
That's great,
I was just thinking

01:44:36.605 --> 01:44:38.315
we should do something like that.

01:44:38.482 --> 01:44:40.108
Yes. I think I know
this place where--

01:44:40.275 --> 01:44:43.904
Listen, I know the perfect ring
that she would love.

01:44:44.654 --> 01:44:46.448
- [reporter] <i>Any men's fashions, Selena?
- Um, no.</i>

01:44:46.615 --> 01:44:48.408
No, I think I better stick to women's
for a while.

01:44:48.575 --> 01:44:50.202
I don't know how
they'd look in my bustiers.

01:44:50.368 --> 01:44:51.495
[laughter]

01:44:51.661 --> 01:44:53.038
Here, give me the money,

01:44:53.288 --> 01:44:55.123
and I'll go shopping
in the next few days,

01:44:55.415 --> 01:44:57.959
and it'll be ready by the time
she comes back from Nashville.

01:44:58.126 --> 01:44:59.628
Oh, that's wonderful, Yolanda.

01:44:59.795 --> 01:45:02.422
- Thank you.
- Don't worry about anything.

01:45:02.589 --> 01:45:04.299
I'm sure she's gonna love it.

01:45:04.466 --> 01:45:05.842
[laughter]

01:45:06.134 --> 01:45:07.969
[reporter]
<i>Chris, how's married life treating you?</i>

01:45:08.386 --> 01:45:10.680
- It's good.
- He better say that.

01:45:11.556 --> 01:45:14.476
[reporter] <i>Selena, are there any plans
for a Selena boutique in Mexico?</i>

01:45:14.726 --> 01:45:16.520

Okay. That's it.
We got that one down.

That's a hit,
and I always knew it.

01:47:27.275 --> 01:47:28.401

We got gold, gentlemen.

What did I tell you, girl?
It's a hit. It's a hit.

01:47:39.663 --> 01:47:41.539
You did it.
Oh, man.

01:47:41.706 --> 01:47:42.707
I bet everybody's gonna wonder

01:47:42.874 --> 01:47:44.042
how I learned English so fast.

01:47:44.209 --> 01:47:45.001
[laughter]

01:47:45.460 --> 01:47:47.170
I'm starving.
Hey, Dad!

01:47:48.004 --> 01:47:48.713
Pizza!

01:47:49.631 --> 01:47:50.715
[Abraham]
I'm so proud of you.

01:47:51.633 --> 01:47:53.218
Watching you cut that record in there.

01:47:54.260 --> 01:47:58.974
Boy, you broke the Tejano
music scene wide open.

01:48:01.851 --> 01:48:03.478
No woman's ever been able to make it.

01:48:05.522 --> 01:48:06.731
Now you're number one.

01:48:08.108 --> 01:48:09.734
[touching music]

01:48:09.901 --> 01:48:11.403
You walk into Mexico and...

01:48:12.320 --> 01:48:14.030
they don't even
accept Mexican-Americans

01:48:14.197 --> 01:48:15.031
and they love you.

01:48:17.283 --> 01:48:18.660
And now, whew!

01:48:20.078 --> 01:48:21.997
And now gringos.

01:48:22.163 --> 01:48:23.707
[chuckles]

01:48:23.873 --> 01:48:25.125
Disney World!

01:48:26.001 --> 01:48:28.169
- [Abraham chuckles] You remember.
- Yeah.

01:48:32.590 --> 01:48:34.009
Boy, all those barriers

01:48:34.175 --> 01:48:35.969
that people have been
trying to get past...

01:48:38.388 --> 01:48:40.598
you went right through them
as if they didn't exist.

01:48:42.517 --> 01:48:44.185
Maybe for you they don't exist.

01:48:48.023 --> 01:48:48.982
I love you...

01:48:50.275 --> 01:48:51.943
and I'm very proud of you.

01:48:55.321 --> 01:48:55.947
Thanks.

01:48:57.949 --> 01:48:58.950
I'm tired.

01:49:03.163 --> 01:49:05.123
- What about this blue?
- Mm-mm.

01:49:05.415 --> 01:49:06.332
Blue out.

01:49:06.666 --> 01:49:07.625
[chuckles]

01:49:08.460 --> 01:49:09.711
- Okay.
- That's pretty.

01:49:09.878 --> 01:49:11.046
- This is nice, isn't it?
- Yes.

01:49:11.212 --> 01:49:12.505
I think you should
go with that one.

01:49:13.923 --> 01:49:16.926
You know, Selena,
I am so proud of you...

01:49:18.178 --> 01:49:19.846
for the opening of the boutique

01:49:20.013 --> 01:49:21.097
and the new record.

01:49:22.182 --> 01:49:23.475
You mean so much to me.

01:49:23.683 --> 01:49:24.976
I bought you a little present.

01:49:26.019 --> 01:49:27.145
Yolanda.

01:49:30.356 --> 01:49:32.525
Oh. You shouldn't have done that.

01:49:34.861 --> 01:49:36.404
[Selena]
Oh, my gosh.

01:49:36.905 --> 01:49:38.990
That is so beautiful.

01:49:39.991 --> 01:49:41.451
A ring with an egg.

01:49:41.618 --> 01:49:43.745
[both laugh]

01:49:43.912 --> 01:49:45.330
Oh, I love it.

01:49:47.373 --> 01:49:48.875
[Yolanda]
You're such a good friend.

01:49:55.173 --> 01:49:57.133
- [Chris] Hey!
- [Selena] What'd you get?

01:49:57.634 --> 01:49:58.635
Junk food.

01:50:01.096 --> 01:50:01.888
Good.

01:50:03.973 --> 01:50:05.850
- [Chris] How's the grass going?
- Good.

01:50:08.895 --> 01:50:10.688
You know what? I want a farm.

01:50:11.439 --> 01:50:12.816
- A farm?
- Mm-hmm.

01:50:13.399 --> 01:50:15.318
Not a big farm,
just a little farm.

01:50:15.652 --> 01:50:16.986
About ten acres or so.

01:50:17.278 --> 01:50:18.655
What, you want me getting up
early in the morning

01:50:18.822 --> 01:50:20.281
and riding around in a tractor?

01:50:21.032 --> 01:50:22.826
Yeah.
And I want to see you feeding the pigs.

01:50:23.076 --> 01:50:25.995
Oh, okay. Feed the pigs.
I don't think so.

01:50:26.162 --> 01:50:27.080
[laughs]

01:50:27.247 --> 01:50:28.748
And I want lots of animals too.

01:50:29.165 --> 01:50:31.292
Just, like, we'll put up
a wood fence in the front

01:50:31.459 --> 01:50:33.628
and just have all the cows
and chickens and horses

01:50:33.795 --> 01:50:35.296
and goats and pigs.

01:50:35.463 --> 01:50:36.422
Wait, wait, wait,

01:50:37.006 --> 01:50:39.092
if you're going to have a lot of different
animals, you have to keep them apart.

01:50:39.259 --> 01:50:40.593
'Cause if you don't,
they'll eat each other up.

01:50:41.761 --> 01:50:43.888
Not my animals.
My animals are gonna get along great.

01:50:44.722 --> 01:50:45.932
Whatever you say.

01:50:49.269 --> 01:50:50.520
You know, I've been thinking.

01:50:52.856 --> 01:50:55.066
About maybe having some
little animals of our own.

01:50:59.612 --> 01:51:00.196
Kids?

01:51:02.490 --> 01:51:03.199
Why not?

01:51:04.742 --> 01:51:07.370
Yeah, but what about
the singing and the touring?

01:51:08.288 --> 01:51:09.831
I mean, you want to give it up?

01:51:10.456 --> 01:51:11.416
No, of course not.

01:51:13.293 --> 01:51:15.170
We could just take the kids along with us.

01:51:15.336 --> 01:51:16.963
I mean,
it's a family act, right?

01:51:21.843 --> 01:51:25.221
So--so, you're talking kids, the career,

01:51:26.139 --> 01:51:27.599
and a farm with lots of animals?

01:51:27.765 --> 01:51:29.058
[chuckles]
Yeah.

01:51:30.727 --> 01:51:32.270
Why not?
Anything's possible.

01:51:34.981 --> 01:51:35.648
Kids, huh?

01:51:42.530 --> 01:51:43.198
Okay.

01:51:44.407 --> 01:51:45.116
Let's do it.

01:51:46.284 --> 01:51:47.243
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:51:47.493 --> 01:51:49.120
[laughs]

01:51:51.915 --> 01:51:53.291
- Let's get started.
- [laughs]

01:51:55.084 --> 01:51:56.461
- Ay!
- Go! Go! Go! Go!

01:51:56.628 --> 01:51:58.213
You forgot the food!

01:52:09.933 --> 01:52:13.603
Hey, Dad, what is so important
you had to drag me out over here?

01:52:16.147 --> 01:52:18.524
[sighs]
Selena, we got a problem

01:52:18.691 --> 01:52:19.901
and I don't even know where to start.

01:52:20.568 --> 01:52:22.779
- [Abraham] It's Yolanda.
- What?

01:52:23.029 --> 01:52:24.656
We started to get
complaints from fans

01:52:24.822 --> 01:52:26.282
who had sent their money
to the fan club

01:52:26.449 --> 01:52:28.743
and had received nothing,
not a picture, <i>nada.</i>

01:52:29.619 --> 01:52:31.204
Then we found out that
she had had a problem

01:52:31.371 --> 01:52:32.622
with a previous employer.

01:52:33.289 --> 01:52:35.124
What kind of problem?
Because you know Yolanda.

01:52:35.291 --> 01:52:37.418
- She wouldn't do that.
- Money problems.

01:52:38.253 --> 01:52:39.170
[Abraham]
Now, we didn't find out about it

01:52:39.337 --> 01:52:40.672
because they had
settled it out of court,

01:52:41.339 --> 01:52:42.715
but I went through the records
of some of the fan clubs

01:52:42.882 --> 01:52:44.092
and came up with these checks.

01:52:45.176 --> 01:52:46.594
[Abraham]
They're very suspicious to me.

01:52:50.598 --> 01:52:51.474
And what's worse...

01:52:52.725 --> 01:52:54.143
is a lot of the records are missing.

01:52:58.856 --> 01:52:59.691
Selena...

01:53:01.526 --> 01:53:02.318
I'm worried.

01:53:03.319 --> 01:53:05.113
She's been handling all
the business of the boutiques.

01:53:05.405 --> 01:53:06.155
I know.

01:53:17.875 --> 01:53:20.044
I don't know what to tell you,
Mr. Quintanilla.

01:53:21.337 --> 01:53:24.173
It's true,
I did have a problem

01:53:24.340 --> 01:53:25.800
with a doctor I worked with...

01:53:26.926 --> 01:53:30.513
but I would never take
anything from Selena. Never.

01:53:31.764 --> 01:53:33.141
I love Selena.

01:53:35.351 --> 01:53:38.271
I-I-I--I don't remember these checks.

01:53:43.735 --> 01:53:45.320
[Abraham]
What about the missing records?

01:53:46.529 --> 01:53:49.532
I don't know where they are,
but I'll find them.

01:53:51.242 --> 01:53:53.119
I will, and I'll show you.

01:53:55.330 --> 01:53:58.124
We'll need an accounting
of all the money, Yolanda.

01:54:04.130 --> 01:54:07.008
[tense music]

01:54:21.189 --> 01:54:22.065
[Selena]
Yolanda!

01:54:24.734 --> 01:54:25.985
How could you do this to me?

01:54:26.152 --> 01:54:28.112
I never took anything
from you, Selena.

01:54:28.279 --> 01:54:31.282
I trusted you. I trusted you
with everything I have.

01:54:31.449 --> 01:54:32.367
[Yolanda]
Never.

01:54:33.451 --> 01:54:34.994
How could you do this to my fans?

01:54:35.328 --> 01:54:36.579
You know what they mean to me.

01:54:36.746 --> 01:54:39.665
Please, give me a chance
to prove it to you.

01:54:40.041 --> 01:54:40.666
Please.

01:54:46.631 --> 01:54:47.965
[crowd cheering]

01:54:49.342 --> 01:54:51.302
