WEBVTT

00:00.701 --> 00:02.669
REFRESH MY MEMORY:
WHO TOLD YOU ABOUT
THE GREAT

00:02.736 --> 00:04.471
- NEW YOGURT PLACE
IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD?
- YOU DID.

00:04.538 --> 00:06.974
AND WHO WAS LIKE, "OH,
IT'S ONLY FROZEN YOGURT.
HOW GOOD COULD IT BE?"

00:07.040 --> 00:10.344
- I DID.
- AND WHO WAS--

00:10.410 --> 00:14.014
OOOH, YOU WERE SAYING?

00:14.081 --> 00:18.418
IF THEY SERVE YOGURT
IN HEAVEN, I BET YOU
IT TASTES LIKE THAT.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.922
MMM, AND IT'D BE SERVED
BY A CHISELED ANGEL.

00:21.989 --> 00:25.359
OOOF, THAT IS SOMETHING.

00:25.425 --> 00:28.462
YEAH, IT'S FREEZING
BACK THERE AND HE'S NOT
WEARING A JACKET.

00:30.297 --> 00:32.366
BUT IT LOOKS LIKE
HE'S WORKING UP A SWEAT,

00:32.432 --> 00:34.134
SO I'M GONNA GO
SAMPLE THAT.

00:34.201 --> 00:36.170
OH NO NO.
YOU'RE NOT DOING
THIS TO ME AGAIN.

00:36.236 --> 00:38.906
- NOT DOING WHAT?
- BACK HOME, EVERY TIME
WE FOUND A PLACE WE LIKED,

00:38.972 --> 00:41.508
YOU'D ALWAYS END UP LIKING
A GUY THAT WORKED THERE
AND DATING HIM.

00:41.575 --> 00:44.011
REALLY, JO?
EVERY TIME?

00:44.077 --> 00:47.014
ARE YOU
FORGETTING THE DONUT HUT?
THE BARBECUE HUT?

00:47.080 --> 00:49.249
WAFFLE HUT?

00:49.316 --> 00:52.119
NO,<i>BUT</i>I DID FORGET

00:52.186 --> 00:53.587
HOW BADLY PEOPLE NAMED
THINGS BACK HOME.

00:53.654 --> 00:55.389
EVEN THE CHURCHES.

00:55.455 --> 00:58.091
DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT
MY JESUS HUT.

00:59.927 --> 01:02.229
SO I DATED A FEW GUYS.
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WITH THAT?

01:02.296 --> 01:05.232
THAT YOU ALWAYS
BREAK UP WITH THEM
AND FOR THE WORST REASONS.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.401
"I DIDN'T LIKE HIS EARLOBES"?
"HE DROVE FUNNY"?

01:07.467 --> 01:09.670
"HE BLINKS TOO MUCH."
"HE DOESN'T BLINK ENOUGH."

01:09.736 --> 01:12.172
I'M PICKY.
STILL DON'T SEE
THE PROBLEM.

01:12.239 --> 01:13.907
THE PROBLEM IS THEY END UP
WRECKED

01:13.974 --> 01:15.943
AND THEN WE CAN'T GO
ANYWHERE NEAR THEM

01:16.009 --> 01:19.346
OR THEIR RESTAURANTS.
I HAVE LOST SO MUCH GOOD FOOD.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.348
CAN I JUST--
CAN I KEEP THE YOGURT?

01:21.415 --> 01:23.684
LADIES, SOME TOPPINGS
ON THE HOUSE.

01:23.750 --> 01:27.254
MAY I RECOMMEND THE FAIR-TRADE
SALTED CHOCOLATE SAUCE?

01:27.321 --> 01:29.756
WE SOURCE IT FROM AN ORGANIC
CACAO FARM IN BRAZIL.

01:29.823 --> 01:33.427
- ( SNORTS )
- WELL,<i>GRACIAS.</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:38.966
- DID HE JUST WINK AT YOU?
-<i>SI.</i>

01:39.032 --> 01:40.767
- ( GROANS )
- ( LAUGHS )

01:40.834 --> 01:45.005
THIS IS THE ONLY DESSERT
THAT MY FRAGILE DIGESTIVE
SYSTEM CAN HANDLE.

01:45.072 --> 01:48.842
CAN YOU JUST PLEASE THIS ONCE
SEE THE WINK AND LET IT GO?

01:50.410 --> 01:52.279
OKAY FINE, JO,
YOU'RE MY BEST FRIEND.

01:52.346 --> 01:54.748
- I WON'T GO FULL-GEORGIA
ON THAT MAN.
- REALLY?

01:54.815 --> 01:56.750
- MM-HMM.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.

01:56.817 --> 01:59.386
ALL RIGHT, YOU'RE GONNA BE
LATE FOR SCHOOL AND I HAVE
THAT AUDITION TO GET TO.

01:59.453 --> 02:02.256
WHAT IS IT AGAIN?
"WOMAN WITH P.M.S."?
YOU WANT TO RUN LINES?

02:02.322 --> 02:06.827
I DON'T THINK IT'S THE LINES.
IT'S ABOUT REALLY TAPPING
INTO THAT HONEST PLACE.

02:06.894 --> 02:09.363
YOU KNOW, WHERE--
THAT PLACE THAT--

02:09.429 --> 02:11.899
( TEARFULLY )
YOU NEVER UNDERSTAND

02:11.965 --> 02:16.069
BECAUSE YOU<i>NEVER</i>EVER
UNDERSTAND ME.

02:20.007 --> 02:22.075
I THINK I GOT IT.

02:24.011 --> 02:26.046
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

02:38.425 --> 02:40.127
GOOD MORNING, EVERYONE.

02:40.194 --> 02:44.998
I'M JO PYE, BUT YOU CAN
CALL ME JO 3.1415.

02:46.533 --> 02:48.101
NO? OKAY.

02:48.168 --> 02:51.772
SO PROFESSOR FARBER ASKED ME
TO BE GROUP LEADER

02:51.839 --> 02:54.508
ON THE NEXT-GENERATION
SHUTTLE DESIGN PROJECT.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.977
UM, FARBER SHOULD HAVE
ASKED ME TO BE THE LEADER.

02:57.044 --> 03:01.682
- WHY, LEWIS?
NATURALLY TAKE OVER A ROOM.

03:03.784 --> 03:06.486
ALSO MY MOM
WROTE HIM A NOTE.

03:08.155 --> 03:09.923
YEAH, SHE WROTE ME ONE TOO.

03:09.990 --> 03:12.826
APPARENTLY I HAVE TO GIVE YOU
SOME MEDICATION AFTER LUNCH.

03:12.893 --> 03:15.095
-<i>( LAUGHING )</i>
- FACE!

03:17.698 --> 03:21.435
SO WHERE ARE WE ON THE SPECS
WITH THE HEAT SHIELDS?

03:21.502 --> 03:23.937
SETH AND I DEVELOPED
A NEW TECHNOLOGY

03:24.004 --> 03:26.807
FOR INJECTING
INTO THE TILES' INNER CORE.

03:26.874 --> 03:29.776
WE BELIEVE THIS WILL ALLOW
HEAT RESISTANCEOVIDE

03:29.843 --> 03:31.979
UP TO 1300Â° CELSIUS.

03:32.045 --> 03:34.147
TERRIFIC.
OKAY, NOW WE JUST NEED TO TEST

03:34.214 --> 03:36.183
THE TILES IN A REAL-WORLD
ENVIRONMENT.

03:36.250 --> 03:37.718
SO DO YOU GUYS
HAVE ANY IDEAS?

03:37.784 --> 03:41.455
- SETH HAS A THEORY.
- NO, I DON'T.

03:43.724 --> 03:46.527
HE THINKS WE SHOULD TEST
NEXT TO YOU. PUTTING THEM

03:46.593 --> 03:48.829
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.931
'CAUSE YOU'RE SMOKIN' HOT.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.736
I'VE SEEN HOTTER.

03:57.538 --> 04:00.174
NOT IN PERSON.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.849
WHOO-HOO.
WHOO.

04:08.916 --> 04:12.085
WHOO, YOU TASTE
LIKE WAFFLE CONE TOO.

04:13.654 --> 04:16.790
OH, THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
ALL THE BITING.

04:18.258 --> 04:20.294
I DIDN'T EAT LUNCH.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.063
- OH...
-<i>( KEYS JANGLE )</i>

04:23.130 --> 04:25.766
( GRUNTS )

04:36.009 --> 04:38.378
YOU GOTTA GO.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.247
UH, WHY?

04:40.314 --> 04:42.049
BECAUSE I'M LATE
FOR ACTING CLASS.

04:42.115 --> 04:45.185
BUT WE WILL FINISH
ALL OF THIS TOMORROW.

04:45.252 --> 04:47.354
OKAY, COOL.

04:47.421 --> 04:49.590
ONE FOR THE ROAD?

04:49.656 --> 04:51.725
- SURE.
- SEE YA.

04:55.429 --> 04:57.965
YOU REALLY THINK
I WOULDN'T HAVE SEEN HIM?

04:59.333 --> 05:02.269
AND THE COUNTDOWN TO ME
LOSING MY YOGURT BEGINS...

05:02.336 --> 05:04.104
NOW.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.639
STOP IT, OKAY?
HE'S CUTE.

05:05.706 --> 05:07.441
WHO KNOWS
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

05:07.508 --> 05:09.176
OH, I KNOW!
PICK ME, RIGHT HERE!

05:10.344 --> 05:12.212
THIS THING--
ONE FOR THE ROAD?

05:13.947 --> 05:16.383
- THE FIST BUMP IS CUTE.
- OH, IT'S CUTE NOW.

05:16.450 --> 05:18.318
WAIT TILL FRIDAY WHEN
YOU'RE LIKE, "YUCK!

05:18.385 --> 05:20.754
I CAN'T BELIEVE THE FIST-BUMP
GUY KEEPS CALLING ME."

05:22.489 --> 05:25.592
JO, PLEASE.
I WOULDN'T HAVE SNUCK
BACK INTO THE STORE,

05:25.659 --> 05:27.895
GIVEN BRAD MY NUMBER,
THEN INVITED HIM OVER

05:27.961 --> 05:31.832
IF I DIDN'T THINK THERE
WAS A CHANCE OF SOMETHING
REAL BETWEEN US.

05:35.435 --> 05:38.605
THAT FIST-BUMP THING
IS GONNA DRIVE ME CRAZY.

05:38.672 --> 05:42.643
- I KNEW IT!
- LADIES, LADIES, PLEASE.

05:42.709 --> 05:45.712
WHAT IS ALL OF THIS RUCKUS?
I'M TRYING TO GET SOME SLEEP.

05:45.779 --> 05:48.482
YOU KNOW HOW EXHAUSTING
IT IS WHEN GEORGE CLOONEY

05:48.549 --> 05:50.250
IS IN TOWN.

05:53.253 --> 05:54.755
DIFFERENT ONE!

05:54.821 --> 05:57.324
BUT ALSO LOOKS GREAT
IN THE BATMAN SUIT.

05:59.826 --> 06:03.130
GEORGIA IS DATING THE GUY
FROM OUR NEW FAVORITE
YOGURT STORE.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.933
MMM, SAY GOODBYE
TO THAT YOGURT.

06:05.999 --> 06:08.435
EVERYTHING WAS FINE
UNTIL THIS ONE

06:08.502 --> 06:10.771
POINTED OUT EXACTLY
WHAT HE'S GONNA DO

06:10.838 --> 06:12.940
- TO MAKE ME GO CRAZY.
- OH, SAY NO MORE.

06:13.006 --> 06:16.009
I ONCE TRAVELED THAT ROAD
WITH A YOUNG WOLFGANG PUCK.

06:16.076 --> 06:19.046
OOH, THAT ACCENT.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.949
SEXY AT FIRST,
BUT AFTER A WHILE YOU'RE LIKE,

06:22.015 --> 06:24.484
"HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN
LIVING HERE?"

06:26.620 --> 06:28.522
SO WHAT
ARE WE GONNA DO?

06:28.589 --> 06:30.757
I DON'T THINK YOU
SHOULD BE ASKING ME.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.693
I THINK YOU SHOULD BE
ASKING YOURSELF.

06:32.759 --> 06:35.262
"WHO AM I?
WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?"

06:35.329 --> 06:37.364
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- BUH-BUH-BUH!

06:37.431 --> 06:40.267
WHO AM I?
WHAT DO<i>I</i>NEED TO DO?

06:40.334 --> 06:42.903
OH OH, OKAY,
I GET WHERE YOU'RE
GOING WITH THIS.

06:42.970 --> 06:45.906
UH, I AM AN ACTRESS.

06:45.973 --> 06:48.275
-<i>MMM.</i>
- I AM A SCIENTIST.

06:48.342 --> 06:51.011
- AND WE NEED TO?
- AND YOU NEED TO...

06:51.078 --> 06:52.679
COMBINE OUR TALENTS.
LIKE I CAN USE

06:52.746 --> 06:55.449
MY SCIENTIFIC TRAINING
TO RECREATE THE YOGURT RECIPE.

06:55.516 --> 06:58.552
WHILE I USE MY SKILLS
AS AN ACTRESS TO...

06:58.619 --> 07:00.420
STRING BRAD ALONG
TILL YOU CRACK IT.

07:00.487 --> 07:02.756
OOOH, AUNT HONEY,
YOU'RE A GENIUS.

07:02.823 --> 07:05.492
THAT'S WHAT DENZEL SAYS.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.496
YES, THAT ONE.
( LAUGHS )

07:20.741 --> 07:24.878
SO WE'RE GONNA PUT
THE SPACE-SHUTTLE DESIGN
PROJECT ASIDE

07:24.945 --> 07:27.181
FOR A FEW DAYS AND INSTEAD
WORK ON ONE OF THE GREAT

07:27.247 --> 07:29.183
SCIENTIFIC MYSTERIES
OF OUR TIME.

07:29.249 --> 07:31.185
- DARK MATTER?
- QUANTUM MECHANICS?

07:31.251 --> 07:32.986
WHY SETH TAKES
SUCH LONG SHOWERS?

07:33.987 --> 07:36.423
- SHUT UP.
- YOU DO.

07:37.824 --> 07:39.393
EW, NO.

07:39.459 --> 07:41.128
YOGURT.

07:41.195 --> 07:44.464
WE ARE GONNA TRY TO FIGURE OUT
HOW TO MAKE<i>THIS.</i>

07:44.531 --> 07:46.400
WHAT?
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

07:46.466 --> 07:50.003
HOW CAN YOGURT
BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN
AMERICA'S SPACE PROGRAM?

07:50.070 --> 07:52.840
OKAY, IF YOU WERE GROUP LEADER,
I WOULD HAVE TO ANSWER
THAT, LEWIS,

07:52.906 --> 07:55.042
BUT YOU'RE NOT,
SO LET'S GET TO WORK.

07:55.108 --> 07:57.010
I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH THIS.

07:57.077 --> 07:58.979
YOU GONNA
CALL YOUR MOM?

07:59.046 --> 08:02.850
( LAUGHS )
FACE!

08:02.916 --> 08:05.986
WATCH IT, SETH.
I WILL CONTROL-ALT-DELETE YOU.

08:09.990 --> 08:12.593
THE STAKES ARE HIGH,
THE CLOCK IS TICKING

08:12.659 --> 08:16.864
AND I HOPE YOU ALL BROUGHT
YOUR BIG-BOY JAMMIES.

08:16.930 --> 08:18.999
SETH SLEEPS IN THE NUDE.

08:20.367 --> 08:21.869
SHUT UP!

08:31.411 --> 08:34.147
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?
- THAT IS DELICIOUS.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.316
YOU KNOW WHAT I CALL IT?
GEORGIA PEACH.

08:38.118 --> 08:40.354
( FORCED LAUGH )

08:40.420 --> 08:42.856
RANDOM QUESTION, BRAD,

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
HOW WOULD YOU MAKE THIS?
LIKE EXACTLY?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.027
- LIKE, WALK ME THROUGH IT.
- ( LAUGHS )

08:47.094 --> 08:49.963
- THAT'S A GOOD ONE, JO.
- I'M NOT KIDDING.

08:50.030 --> 08:53.267
UH, YOU KNOW I CAN'T
SHARE THE RECIPE.

08:53.333 --> 08:55.669
BUT I CAN TELL YOU
THE SECRET INGREDIENT:

08:55.736 --> 08:56.803
PASSION.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.674
DON'T YOU THINK
WE FIST BUMP TOO MUCH?

09:00.741 --> 09:02.342
NO.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.378
OH.

09:07.281 --> 09:10.017
( CLEARS THROAT )
IF THERE WAS A FORK
IN THIS PLACE,

09:10.083 --> 09:12.686
I WOULD STICK IT
IN MY EYE.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.721
IT'S ONLY BEEN THREE DAYS.

09:14.788 --> 09:17.457
AND HE IS COMPLETELY
IN LOVE WITH ME.

09:17.524 --> 09:20.027
DO YOU KNOW THAT HE FORCED ME
TO MAKE HIM #1 ON MY SPEED DIAL?

09:20.093 --> 09:22.196
- HE TOOK MY SPOT?
- YES!

09:22.262 --> 09:26.366
YOU WERE #1,
NOT MY GUY DALE AT ZAPPOS

09:26.433 --> 09:28.001
WHO HOOKS ME UP
WITH THE FAST SHIPPING.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.337
( BEEPS )

09:30.404 --> 09:33.040
"THINKING OF YOU."

09:36.476 --> 09:38.612
WATCH THIS MOMENT, JO.
WATCH THIS MOMENT.

09:38.679 --> 09:41.014
THIS IS ACTUALLY
HAPPENING.

09:41.081 --> 09:44.318
HE JUST BLEW ME A FIST BUMP
AND NOW I HAVE TO CATCH IT.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.256
PLEASE HURRY UP AND FIND
THAT RECIPE, OKAY?

09:49.323 --> 09:51.258
I'M TRYING.
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING NOW?

09:51.325 --> 09:54.194
OH, THIS IS CALLED
ROCKING THE FIST BABY.

09:55.195 --> 09:58.165
OH, THIS IS NEW.
HE'S BURPING IT.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.836
PLEASE HELP ME.

10:11.578 --> 10:16.850
OKAY, I'M TASTING THE COCONUT,
BUT I'M NOT TASTING THE ISLAND.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.186
( GROANS )

10:19.253 --> 10:22.723
THAT FORMULA COST US
TWO LAB RATS

10:22.789 --> 10:25.659
AND A PINKIE NAIL.

10:25.726 --> 10:27.461
I SAID, "LOOK OUT, SETH.

10:27.528 --> 10:30.464
I'M POURING THE LIQUID
NITROGEN NOW."

10:30.531 --> 10:34.401
DID YOU SAY IT, LEO,
OR DID YOU JUST THINK IT?

10:34.468 --> 10:36.670
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS,
I'M SORRY, BUT WE'RE GONNA

10:36.737 --> 10:38.639
HAVE TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS
UNTIL WE GET IT.

10:38.705 --> 10:40.440
NO WE'RE NOT!

10:40.507 --> 10:42.309
I CHECKED
WITH PROFESSOR FARBER

10:42.376 --> 10:45.045
- AND HE KNEW NOTHING
OF PROJECT YOGURT.
- ( GASPS )

10:45.112 --> 10:48.148
THAT'S RIGHT, GASP.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.984
THE FEMALE HAS BEEN
WASTING OUR TIME.

10:51.051 --> 10:55.489
FINE!
PROFESSOR FARBER DIDN'T
KNOW ABOUT PROJECT YOGURT.

10:55.556 --> 10:57.257
BUT I HAVE NOT BEEN
WASTING YOUR TIME.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.194
DO YOU KNOW
WHAT AN ICE CREAM TRUCK
SOUNDS LIKE?

11:02.095 --> 11:04.731
FOR MOST KIDS
IT'S THE SOUND OF HAPPINESS.

11:04.798 --> 11:07.367
BUT NOT ME.
NO, I WAS DIFFERENT.

11:07.434 --> 11:09.870
I COULDN'T DIGEST
MILK-BASED FOOD PRODUCTS.

11:09.937 --> 11:12.172
DID YOU TRY SOY?

11:12.239 --> 11:14.875
SOY?!
SOY SUCKS.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.345
WHEN I FOUND THIS YOGURT
IT'S LIKE SOMEONE

11:18.412 --> 11:20.214
HAD FINALLY GIVEN ME
MY CHILDHOOD.

11:20.280 --> 11:24.685
SO, FINE.
YOU GUYS CAN GO BACK

11:24.751 --> 11:27.321
TO WORKING ON THE SHUTTLE

11:27.387 --> 11:29.156
AND MAYBE YOU'LL HELP
A FEW ASTRONAUTS

11:29.223 --> 11:32.025
AND SOME PILOTS
THAT HAVE BEEN WINNERS
THEIR WHOLE LIFE,

11:32.092 --> 11:35.963
OR YOU COULD CHANGE
THE LIFE OF ONE GIRL

11:36.029 --> 11:39.199
WHO WAS BORN
WITH THE WRONG STUFF.

11:42.669 --> 11:45.405
ALL:
ASTRONAUTS.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.641
LOOKS LIKE WE NEED
A NEW LEADER.

11:47.708 --> 11:49.843
AND THAT IS WHAT YOU GET
FOR TRYING TO KEEP

11:49.910 --> 11:51.778
AN ALPHA MALE DOWN.

11:54.314 --> 11:55.949
OKAY, I HAVE AN IDEA!

11:56.016 --> 11:58.685
THE FIRST PERSON TO FIGURE OUT
THIS YOGURT RECIPE

11:58.752 --> 12:00.153
GETS A KISS.

12:00.220 --> 12:01.355
TONGUE?

12:01.421 --> 12:02.823
- CHEEK.
- LIPS?

12:02.890 --> 12:04.658
- CLOSED.
- DEAL!

12:05.759 --> 12:07.027
DAMN!

12:09.263 --> 12:11.198
THANKS FOR LETTING ME
PICK THE MOVIE.

12:11.265 --> 12:13.467
THANKS FOR THINKING
I LET YOU PICK
THE MOVIE.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.537
GREAT TEAM.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.007
YOU--

12:21.909 --> 12:25.145
Y-YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK THAT I'M DONE
WITH THE FIST BUMP.

12:25.212 --> 12:27.347
UH, WHAT?

12:27.414 --> 12:31.318
OH-OH.
YOU WANT TO TAKE IT
TO THE NEXT LEVEL.

12:31.385 --> 12:33.487
AH... YES.

12:34.588 --> 12:38.926
YES, ANY OTHER LEVEL
WOULD JUST BE GREAT.

12:38.992 --> 12:40.861
RIGHT OKAY,
YEAH YEAH, I HEAR YOU.

12:40.928 --> 12:44.198
UM, SO FIST BUMP...

12:44.264 --> 12:45.499
- YEAH?
- MM-HMM.

12:45.566 --> 12:48.168
...AND EXPLODE!

12:48.235 --> 12:50.637
OH OH, SO--
OH, I'LL BE BACK.

12:50.704 --> 12:51.972
NO NO NO, JO!

12:52.039 --> 12:54.508
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?
WHY DON'T YOU COME ON IN

12:54.575 --> 12:57.945
AND JOIN US
RIGHT NOW, RIGHT HERE?
SERIOUSLY, PLEASE.

12:58.011 --> 12:59.146
- HEY, JO.
- HEY.

12:59.213 --> 13:01.181
I BROUGHT YOU A PINT
OF SALTED CARAMEL.

13:01.248 --> 13:03.450
THANKS, PAL!

13:05.586 --> 13:08.021
UH-OH.
SOMEBODY'S JEALOUS.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.958
I WAS GONNA SAVE THIS
FOR THE WEEKEND, BUT...

13:11.024 --> 13:12.926
DOUBLE TAP.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.362
RIGHT THERE.

13:15.429 --> 13:17.364
LET ME JUST TAKE OFF
MY JEWELRY REAL QUICK.

13:17.431 --> 13:18.899
- CONSIDERATE.
- YEAH YEAH.

13:18.966 --> 13:22.269
OWIE.

13:22.336 --> 13:23.537
- FEISTY.
- HEY.

13:23.604 --> 13:27.341
I LIKE THAT. I'LL--
I WILL TEXT YOU LATER.

13:27.407 --> 13:29.710
OKAY, I'M SURE YOU WILL.

13:31.712 --> 13:35.215
OH MY...
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?!

13:35.282 --> 13:37.518
YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO RESCUE ME AN HOUR AGO.

13:37.584 --> 13:39.686
I'M SORRY.
I WAS STUCK AT THE LAB.

13:39.753 --> 13:42.556
- ARE YOU MAKING ANY PROGRESS?
- ON THE YOGURT, NO.

13:42.623 --> 13:45.392
BUT I HAVE MANAGED
TO MAKE MY LOVE LIFE
EVEN MORE HUMILIATING.

13:45.459 --> 13:47.828
- YAY.
- WELL, JO, YOU ARE
ALMOST OUT OF TIME.

13:47.895 --> 13:49.997
HONESTLY, I CANNOT LIE
TO BRAD ANYMORE.

13:50.063 --> 13:51.932
HE'S VERY NICE, YES, BUT--

13:51.999 --> 13:56.103
IT IS NOT HIS FAULT THAT
HE IS BRINGING ME TO HELL
ONE FIST BUMP AT A TIME.

13:56.170 --> 13:58.172
- ( SIGHS )
-<i>( BEEPS )</i>

13:58.238 --> 14:01.909
OH, I GOT A TEXT.
GUESS WHO MISSES ME ALREADY.

14:01.975 --> 14:05.946
"YOU JUST POCKET DIALED ME.
I HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID."

14:06.013 --> 14:08.549
OH MY GOD!

14:08.615 --> 14:12.019
DO YOU THINK HE KNOWS NOW THAT
WE'RE JUST STRINGING HIM ALONG
UNTIL I GET THE RECIPE?

14:12.085 --> 14:14.321
OH NO, I AM TOO GOOD
OF AN ACTRESS.

14:14.388 --> 14:16.857
- HE'LL NEVER FIGURE THIS OUT.
- ( BEEPS )

14:16.924 --> 14:19.927
"YOUR PHONE IS STILL ON
AND I FIGURED IT OUT."

14:19.993 --> 14:22.396
- WHAT AM I GONNA DO?
- TURN IT OFF, TURN IT OFF.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.498
OH, I'M TRYING.
IT'S NOT WORKING.

14:24.565 --> 14:26.567
- ( BEEPS )
- "HOLD DOWN THE POWER BUTTON."

14:26.633 --> 14:28.802
BRAD, I AM HOLDING DOWN
THE POWER BUTTON!

14:28.869 --> 14:31.138
- OH, IT'S TERRIBLE.
- I KNOW, JO.

14:31.205 --> 14:33.807
I JUST TOOK
A PICTURE OF MYSELF.

14:33.874 --> 14:36.510
WHAT IS GOING ON?
SERIO-- WELL, AT LEAST
IT'S CUTE.

14:36.577 --> 14:38.478
DO YOU SEE THAT?
THAT WAS THE JAW STRUCTURE.

14:38.545 --> 14:40.614
I MEAN WITH BRAD.
DO YOU THINK THAT HE'S GONNA

14:40.681 --> 14:42.616
EVER LET US INTO
THE YOGURT STORE AGAIN?

14:42.683 --> 14:45.252
- ( BEEPS )
- "YEAH, THAT'S A NO WAY."

14:55.929 --> 14:58.265
DON'T MIND ME, GEORGIA.
I'M JUST LOOKING

14:58.332 --> 15:01.068
FOR A DOG COLLAR
I USED TO KEEP DOWN HERE.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.537
- YOU HAD A DOG, AUNT HONEY?
- OH LORD, NO.

15:03.604 --> 15:05.472
WHATEVER GAVE YOU
THAT IDEA?

15:07.107 --> 15:09.610
SO WHERE'S
YOUR GENTLEMAN CALLER?

15:09.676 --> 15:12.112
THAT KIND OF EXPLODED
IN MY FACE.

15:13.614 --> 15:15.616
IT TURNS OUT THAT ME
STRINGING HIM ALONG

15:15.682 --> 15:17.718
WHILE JO
REVERSE-ENGINEERS YOGURT

15:17.784 --> 15:21.822
- NOT SUCH A GREAT IDEA.
- WHO ON EARTH CAME UP
WITH THAT MESS?

15:23.390 --> 15:26.260
- YOU DID.
- OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

15:26.326 --> 15:29.129
THAT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE
SOMETHING I WOULD SUGGEST.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.801
YOU SAID,
"ASK YOURSELF, 'WHO AM I

15:34.868 --> 15:36.770
AND WHAT DO I NEED TO DO?'"

15:36.837 --> 15:38.939
MM-HMM, IT SOUNDS LIKE
I JUST ASKED YOU

15:39.006 --> 15:40.440
A COUPLE
OF VAGUE QUESTIONS

15:40.507 --> 15:43.510
AND LET YOU DRAW
YOUR OWN CONCLUSIONS.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.348
- BUT YOU SOUNDED SO SMART.
- OF COURSE I DID.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.350
WHEN YOU'RE A BLACK WOMAN
OF A CERTAIN AGE,

15:50.417 --> 15:53.320
PEOPLE JUST ASSUME
YOU'RE FULL OF WISDOM.

15:53.387 --> 15:55.989
THAT'S HOW I GOT
ON "CHARLIE ROSE."

15:56.056 --> 15:58.392
GREAT.
SO WHAT AM I SUPPOSED
TO DO NOW?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.694
WELL, GEORGIA, IT DEPENDS.

16:00.761 --> 16:02.596
WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU SHOULD DO?

16:02.663 --> 16:04.798
I SHOULD PROBABLY EXAMINE
MY OWN BEHAVIOR.

16:04.865 --> 16:07.067
I MEAN THIS IS CLEARLY
A PATTERN--

16:07.134 --> 16:08.836
HEY!
YOU ARE DOING IT AGAIN.

16:10.003 --> 16:12.306
FINE, I'LL LET YOU SOLVE
YOUR OWN PROBLEMS.

16:12.372 --> 16:14.608
THANK YOU.

16:14.675 --> 16:17.110
ALL RIGHT, SO MY PROBLEM
IS THAT

16:17.177 --> 16:19.279
WHEN A GUY LIKES ME,

16:19.346 --> 16:21.548
I ENJOY IT BECAUSE I REALLY
LIKE THE ATTENTION.

16:21.615 --> 16:24.151
- MMM.
- BUT THEN

16:24.218 --> 16:28.555
WHEN I DUMP HIM
I END UP HURTING JO.

16:28.622 --> 16:31.258
- UH-HUH.
- SO MAYBE

16:31.325 --> 16:33.627
IT'S ABOUT HOW
I BREAK UP WITH HIM?

16:33.694 --> 16:37.431
- UH?
- MAYBE

16:37.497 --> 16:40.601
INSTEAD OF JUST BLOWING
BRAD OFF, I SHOULD HAVE
SAT DOWN WITH HIM

16:40.667 --> 16:43.136
AND HAD A NICE
ADULT CONVERSATION,

16:43.203 --> 16:46.273
BECAUSE THEN WE WOULD STILL
BE WELCOME IN HIS STORE.

16:46.340 --> 16:50.811
SEE, I FIGURED IT OUT
ALL BY MYSELF.

16:50.878 --> 16:53.547
MMM.

16:53.614 --> 16:55.415
DAG, YOU'RE GOOD!

17:00.120 --> 17:02.923
( MOANING )

17:02.990 --> 17:06.093
YOU DID IT.
YOU GUYS, YOU DID IT,
YOU DID IT!

17:06.159 --> 17:08.595
- OH MY GOSH.
- YES YES!

17:08.662 --> 17:10.998
OW, MY BURSITIS.

17:12.666 --> 17:15.502
WHO IS THE GENIUS
THAT FIGURED THIS OUT?

17:17.004 --> 17:21.508
NO, THEY'RE NOT BOOING.
THEY'RE SAYING LEWWWW-IS!

17:22.776 --> 17:25.112
REALLY?
OKAY.

17:25.179 --> 17:27.114
I GUESS I OWE YOU A KISS.

17:27.181 --> 17:28.815
YES, I BELIEVE
THOSE WERE THE TERMS.

17:31.051 --> 17:33.754
OH, WHAT THE HECK?
YOU GET A HUG TOO!

17:33.820 --> 17:36.390
- I HELPED.
- I LOST A FINGERNAIL.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.159
GROUP HUG.

17:40.994 --> 17:43.797
OKAY, I'M FEELING A LOT
OF EXCITEMENT HERE.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.367
HUG'S OVER.

17:49.369 --> 17:51.605
BUT I WAS STILL REALLY
PROUD OF YOU GUYS.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.109
WAIT A MINUTE,
I RECOGNIZE THIS SPOON.

17:57.611 --> 17:59.947
DID YOU GUYS JUST
GO OUT AND BUY THIS?

18:00.013 --> 18:02.950
IT WAS ALL
LEWIS'S IDEA.

18:03.016 --> 18:05.519
WE'RE PHYSICS STUDENTS,
NOT YOGURTMAKERS.

18:05.586 --> 18:08.522
BUT AT LEAST NOW WE'RE
BOYFRIEND-GIRLFRIEND,
RIGHT?

18:08.589 --> 18:09.823
- WHAT?
- WHAT?

18:12.326 --> 18:14.194
I THINK
THEY'RE BREAKING UP.

18:14.261 --> 18:15.896
I CALL NEXT.

18:26.673 --> 18:29.476
ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT
IT'S NOT REALLY ABOUT YOU.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.945
I JUST--
I'M JUST NOT READY
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS,

18:32.012 --> 18:35.315
AND I'M SORRY I HURT YOU
AND IT WAS RUDE

18:35.382 --> 18:38.252
AND IMMATURE
AND YOU DON'T DESERVE THAT.

18:40.153 --> 18:42.155
YEAH, THAT'S COOL.
I GET IT.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.158
AND I APPRECIATE YOU
COMING DOWN TO TALK
ABOUT IT.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.927
REALLY?
OH WELL,

18:46.994 --> 18:49.596
HOW ABOUT A LITTLE
NO-HARD-FEELINGS BUMP?

18:51.064 --> 18:54.334
I'M SORRY, GEORGIA,
I DON'T DO THAT
WITH JUST ANYONE.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.405
NOW I MISS IT.

19:02.075 --> 19:04.978
JO, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EAT SO FAST.
EVERYTHING'S FINE WITH BRAD.

19:05.045 --> 19:08.448
I KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING
TO GET THE TASTE OF LEWIS
OFF MY LIPS.

19:08.515 --> 19:11.418
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I HAVE TURNED A CORNER, JO.

19:11.485 --> 19:14.821
I LEARNED HOW TO HAVE
A RESPONSIBLE AND MATURE
BREAK-UP

19:14.888 --> 19:17.191
WITH SOMEONE SO THAT
MY BEST FRIEND DOESN'T GET HURT.

19:17.257 --> 19:20.494
I'VE CHANGED.
I'VE GROWN.

19:21.895 --> 19:25.165
AND I WOULD LIKE TO BE
HELD IN THOSE-- OOOH.

19:26.166 --> 19:28.068
( GROANS )
NO.

19:29.336 --> 19:32.272
I'M GONNA MISS YOU.
NO NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

19:32.339 --> 19:36.043
AND IT'S NOT ME.
IT'S HER.

19:41.215 --> 19:45.118
HURRY UP! YOU'RE GOING
TO MISS "THE BACHELOR"'S MOST
DRAMATIC ROSE CEREMONY EVER.

19:45.185 --> 19:47.654
HMM-MM.
I'M NOT FALLING
FOR THAT AGAIN.

19:47.721 --> 19:51.024
UNLESS HE PROPOSES TO BOTH GIRLS
AND THEY ALL RUN OFF TO UTAH,

19:51.091 --> 19:52.926
I'VE SEEN IT ALL.

19:52.993 --> 19:55.729
YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD GO
GREAT WITH THIS FOR DESSERT?

19:55.796 --> 19:57.664
DON'T.

19:58.699 --> 20:01.301
- YOGURT.
- I SAID DON'T.

20:02.436 --> 20:04.271
KINDA LIKE I SAID DON'T.

20:04.338 --> 20:07.107
"DON'T DATE THE<i>OTHER</i>GUY
AT THE YOGURT STORE, GEORGIA.

20:07.174 --> 20:09.443
IT WILL ONLY END BADLY."
AND WHAT HAPPENED?

20:09.510 --> 20:13.714
HE WAS SO CUTE,
EXCEPT FOR THAT ONE

20:13.780 --> 20:17.150
CRAZY NOSE HAIR JUST

20:17.217 --> 20:21.622
HANGING OUT, DARING ME
TO BREAK UP WITH IT.

20:24.224 --> 20:27.661
THEY HAVE OUR PHOTOS
BY THE CASH REGISTER NOW.

20:29.630 --> 20:31.965
- ( SIGHS )
- WELL, AT LEAST YOU FOUND
THIS AMAZING PIZZA.

20:32.032 --> 20:35.702
- WHERE'S IT FROM?
- THE GAYEST PIZZA PLACE
I COULD FIND.

20:40.207 --> 20:42.976
I LOVE A CHALLENGE.

20:52.252 --> 20:55.556
AUNT HONEY, WHAT'S
THE MEANING OF LIFE?

20:55.622 --> 20:58.225
ISN'T THE ANSWER
IN THE QUESTION?

21:00.794 --> 21:02.763
WHAT'S THE SECRET
OF HAPPINESS?

21:02.829 --> 21:05.265
WHY DOES HAPPINESS
HAVE TO BE A SECRET?

21:08.168 --> 21:11.104
- IT'S AMAZING.
- EVERY ANSWER SOUNDS SO DEEP.

21:11.171 --> 21:14.341
BUT IT'S ALL
TOTALLY MEANINGLESS.

21:15.375 --> 21:17.878
IT MAY BE,
BUT IT STILL GETS ME

21:17.945 --> 21:19.947
ON "TAVIS SMILEY"
EVERY YEAR.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.682
WHEN WERE YOU
ON HIS SHOW?

21:21.748 --> 21:23.984
HE HAS A SHOW?

21:30.524 --> 21:32.526
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>
