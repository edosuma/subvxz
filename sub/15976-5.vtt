WEBVTT

00:09.270 --> 00:10.704
Helena's here.
How do I look?

00:10.706 --> 00:11.938
Oh, you look great.

00:11.940 --> 00:13.757
You're five pounds of heaven
in a six-inch heel.

00:13.759 --> 00:14.741
I just got these shoes.

00:14.743 --> 00:15.792
Do you think she'll like them?

00:15.794 --> 00:17.160
Why am I asking you?

00:17.162 --> 00:18.778
You don't know what's chic.

00:18.780 --> 00:20.047
She does.
Look at you.

00:20.049 --> 00:23.667
You got a girl crush on Helena.
That's adorable.

00:23.669 --> 00:25.669
I do not have a crush on Helena.
It's business.

00:25.671 --> 00:27.454
You know, she's here to show us

00:27.456 --> 00:28.722
her new e-date site for seniors.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.425
I'm just glad my dad
is taking lead on this account

00:31.427 --> 00:32.426
because elderly romance falls

00:32.427 --> 00:33.727
slightly outside
my comfort zone.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.262
Wait... your dad's handling
the e-date thing?

00:35.264 --> 00:37.180
He's supposed to be running
the voice-over session for Musk.

00:37.182 --> 00:39.282
But I need him.
Helena's waiting.

00:39.284 --> 00:40.600
Well, I need him more.

00:41.602 --> 00:43.470
What the...?!

00:43.472 --> 00:44.571
What do you got?

00:44.573 --> 00:45.638
See, uh, stacked.
Uh-huh.

00:45.640 --> 00:46.973
Nice can. Stacked.
Yeah.

00:46.975 --> 00:48.775
Nice can. Something
about boobs and butts.

00:48.777 --> 00:50.143
Who could think in this heat?

00:50.145 --> 00:52.529
(sighs) Yeah, when are they
gonna fix your air conditioner?

00:52.531 --> 00:53.747
I do declare,
it's hotter in here

00:53.749 --> 00:55.248
than the devil's scrotum
in a hot tub in hell.

00:55.250 --> 00:58.168
I don't know whether to check
my ass or scratch my watch.

00:58.170 --> 00:59.419
(laughs) Lord, yes!

00:59.421 --> 01:00.871
Dad, I need your help with...

01:00.873 --> 01:02.172
God, it is hot in here.

01:02.174 --> 01:04.123
I need you for the
e-date meeting.

01:04.126 --> 01:05.876
But you promised to run
the voice-over session.

01:05.878 --> 01:07.544
Oh, sweet Lord,
two attractive suitors.

01:07.546 --> 01:09.596
I am positively swooning.

01:09.598 --> 01:10.630
Ooh, my menagerie!

01:10.632 --> 01:11.598
Dad, e-date meeting now!

01:11.600 --> 01:12.933
Voice-over session.
You promised.

01:12.935 --> 01:13.967
I did promise Andrew.

01:13.969 --> 01:15.552
Fine. I'll just go tell Helena

01:15.554 --> 01:16.803
that you made other plans.

01:16.805 --> 01:18.138
Whoa. Helena's here?

01:18.140 --> 01:19.439
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa.

01:19.441 --> 01:21.942
Andrew, you'll have to do
the session by yourself.

01:21.944 --> 01:23.393
You've done it
a thousand times with me.

01:23.395 --> 01:24.811
Yeah, but I've never been
in charge.

01:24.813 --> 01:27.064
I'm just the guy who nods at you
and sometimes shrugs.

01:27.066 --> 01:29.316
It's your moment to shine.
Are you ready?

01:30.151 --> 01:31.118
Really?

01:31.120 --> 01:32.903
Good enough for me.
Helena awaits.

01:32.905 --> 01:34.121
Now, Zachary,

01:34.123 --> 01:36.073
does this shirt
make my eyes pop?

01:36.075 --> 01:38.208
Oh, bluer than a Yankee boy's
uniform.

01:38.210 --> 01:40.544
Dear God, you could charm
the stripes off a baby zebra.

01:40.546 --> 01:42.879
Come on, now! Come sashay with me.
Be my pleasure.

01:42.881 --> 01:44.481
Please help me. I'm starting
to get the vapors.

01:44.483 --> 01:46.133
Oh, I got you. Support
me through this moment.

01:46.135 --> 01:47.134
Don't worry, now.

01:47.136 --> 01:48.835
Here we are,
like bees to honey.

01:48.837 --> 01:50.137
Like moth to a flame.

01:50.139 --> 01:52.756

02:07.055 --> 02:08.721
SIMON: You know, we did
a hell of a job on your

02:08.723 --> 02:10.107
other dating sites.
We'll do it again on this one.

02:10.109 --> 02:12.058
As you know, we're
a soup-to-nuts agency.

02:12.060 --> 02:14.411
Yeah, I provide the nuts.
And I really enjoy soup.

02:14.413 --> 02:16.229
(laughs)
Is it any wonder I always love

02:16.231 --> 02:17.414
coming to see you two?

02:17.416 --> 02:19.583
Oh, we love it when you do!

02:19.585 --> 02:21.368
So, what are you calling
this new site, huh?

02:21.370 --> 02:22.836
We're still looking
for a name that connects

02:22.838 --> 02:23.870
with our mature customers.

02:23.872 --> 02:25.789
Really? How about
"Gray Down There"?

02:25.791 --> 02:27.240
"It's Just Dinner
at Lunchtime."

02:27.242 --> 02:28.425
"Prostate Players."

02:28.427 --> 02:29.793
You are both so naughty.

02:29.795 --> 02:32.379
I love being naughty!
Yeah, spank me, spank me!

02:32.381 --> 02:34.080
But don't worry,
we'll nail the name.

02:34.082 --> 02:35.549
How does this site work?

02:35.551 --> 02:37.083
Well, our customer
creates a profile...

02:37.085 --> 02:38.718
Mm-hmm.
Ooh, make one for Simon!

02:38.720 --> 02:40.520
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes!

02:40.522 --> 02:42.389
Simon Roberts.
Male.

02:42.391 --> 02:44.024
Original hair,
mostly original parts.

02:44.026 --> 02:45.559
Six-foot-two.
Actually, I'm five-eight.

02:45.561 --> 02:47.527
Everyone lies. Six-two
is Internet for five-eight.

02:47.529 --> 02:49.362
You save five-eight, you're
Peter Dinklage. Ooh.

02:49.364 --> 02:50.930
So which parts aren't original?

02:50.932 --> 02:52.649
Wouldn't you like to know?

02:54.202 --> 02:57.270
It's my knee.

02:57.272 --> 02:58.321
So who's this
voice-over guy?

02:58.323 --> 02:59.823
Fred Melamed.
He's a legend.

02:59.825 --> 03:02.292
You might not know his name,
but you know his voice.

03:02.294 --> 03:03.276
CBS News, CBS Sports,

03:03.278 --> 03:04.611
Boar's Head meats and cheeses.

03:04.613 --> 03:05.829
He's the Boar's Head guy?

03:05.831 --> 03:07.280
He made me quit being vegan.

03:07.282 --> 03:08.665
Ah!

03:08.667 --> 03:10.000
Mr. Melamed,
it is such an honor.

03:10.002 --> 03:12.018
My name is Andrew,
and I'll be handling...

03:12.020 --> 03:14.171
I don't really need to
know your name, hippie.

03:14.173 --> 03:15.922
Hippie? That's, uh...

03:15.924 --> 03:18.625
By the way, listen,
that's Corinthian leather.

03:18.627 --> 03:19.976
Try not to ruin it with your

03:19.978 --> 03:20.977
doobie-stained fingers,
all right?

03:20.979 --> 03:22.962
Oh, I don't dabble
in the doobie.

03:22.964 --> 03:24.297
Oh, I'm sure you don't.

03:24.299 --> 03:25.982
Let's just see if we
can't get through today

03:25.984 --> 03:28.151
without you having to huff
on a hookah, okay, Bob Marley?

03:28.153 --> 03:29.436
Just follow me.

03:31.022 --> 03:32.572
Bob Marley.

03:32.574 --> 03:35.025
First question, on
scale of one to ten,

03:35.027 --> 03:37.744
how sexually adventurous are you?
Ten.

03:37.746 --> 03:40.113
With ten including bondage
and light-to-medium spanking.

03:40.115 --> 03:41.648
Four. Maybe a lazy five.

03:41.650 --> 03:43.083
Hell, when
the moon's full, six.

03:43.085 --> 03:44.951
With you, seven.
Let's just round it off

03:44.953 --> 03:47.204
to a racy 8.5
and be done with it.

03:47.206 --> 03:49.089
(both laugh)

03:49.091 --> 03:51.174
Ten.
We'll get to your profile later.

03:51.176 --> 03:52.325
Second question.
Mm-hmm.

03:52.327 --> 03:54.594
What weather system best
describes your sex life?

03:54.596 --> 03:56.463
If we're talking last summer,
I'd say hurricane.

03:56.465 --> 03:57.997
Ironically, with a woman
named Katrina.

03:57.999 --> 03:59.549
(laughs)

03:59.551 --> 04:01.101
At the moment,
bit of a drought.

04:01.103 --> 04:02.435
Fields are dry,
crops are withering.

04:02.437 --> 04:05.055
It Is He Who Sits With His Fist
is my tribal name.

04:05.057 --> 04:06.439
A handsome man like you

04:06.441 --> 04:07.857
should never have a dry spell.

04:07.859 --> 04:09.109
It's a crime.

04:09.111 --> 04:10.977
Felony or misdemeanor?
I don't mind being cuffed.

04:10.979 --> 04:12.596
(laughing) Hey, sorry I'm late.

04:12.598 --> 04:14.180
So, who's getting cuffed?

04:14.182 --> 04:15.982
No, nothing. Your dad
in some weird sex act.

04:15.984 --> 04:17.701
No, no, can we not talk
about this in front of...?

04:17.702 --> 04:19.236
Heavens, why not? She's an adult.
Uh-huh.

04:19.238 --> 04:20.853
Sydney's not some
prudish American, are you?

04:20.855 --> 04:23.957
Moi? No, I'm <i>très</i> cool.

04:23.959 --> 04:26.493
I love hearing my dad talk
about his sex life.

04:26.495 --> 04:28.328
What could possibly
be uncomfortable about that?

04:28.330 --> 04:29.496
Besides, our Web site's designed

04:29.498 --> 04:31.364
to help older people
end their long dry spells.

04:31.366 --> 04:32.666
Hasn't been that long.
It's only been

04:32.668 --> 04:34.084
a month or so. ZACH: A month?

04:34.086 --> 04:35.218
Mm-hmm.
Can you imagine?

04:35.220 --> 04:36.836
I mean, what even happens
to the human body?

04:36.838 --> 04:40.173
Well, I could sit here and talk
about sex all day with my dad,

04:40.175 --> 04:41.591
um, but we have another meeting.

04:41.593 --> 04:44.010
Sydney, I'm only in town a week.
You will make time for me, yes?

04:44.012 --> 04:46.813
Yes! It's a date.
I mean, not a date-date.

04:46.815 --> 04:49.599
It's a lady-female date.
It's more fun than a date.

04:49.601 --> 04:51.818
Oh! We'll have fun, like always.

04:51.820 --> 04:53.520
(both laugh)

04:53.522 --> 04:54.487
Uh, next question.
Okay.

04:54.489 --> 04:55.739
What do you say to a woman

04:55.741 --> 04:57.157
when you want to
make love to her?

04:57.159 --> 04:58.742
"Do you accept checks?"

04:58.744 --> 05:00.577
(laughing)

05:00.579 --> 05:02.061
Sorry, muffin.

05:02.063 --> 05:04.531
We've all been there.
So cool with this!

05:04.533 --> 05:05.699
(all laugh)

05:05.701 --> 05:08.368
I'm glad she's cool with it.

05:08.370 --> 05:09.736
Okay!

05:11.000 --> 05:17.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:18.743 --> 05:20.476
And whenever you are ready...

05:20.478 --> 05:21.895
sir.

05:21.897 --> 05:27.384
All right, laying it down
in three, two...

05:27.386 --> 05:31.171
"Men today are afraid of women.

05:31.173 --> 05:33.540
"Well, I'm not scared
to be sexy.

05:33.542 --> 05:35.926
"I unbutton the second button
on my shirt.

05:35.928 --> 05:37.327
"You know the one.

05:37.329 --> 05:42.883
And then I slap on some Musk,
because women smell fear."

05:44.268 --> 05:46.720
Well, I think that was golden.
Now on to the tag.

05:46.722 --> 05:48.671
He's so commanding.
Very alpha.

05:48.673 --> 05:51.141
Don't you think he could be
a touch less serial killer-y?

05:51.143 --> 05:53.343
I gotta tell him.
I wouldn't do that.

05:53.345 --> 05:54.945
Hey, uh, that was great, Fred.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.512
I just wondered if we could do

05:56.514 --> 05:57.697
one more, and this time, um...

05:57.699 --> 06:00.033
I can't hear a word
you're saying.

06:00.035 --> 06:02.652
Spit out the bong water
and hold down that damn button!

06:02.654 --> 06:05.822
Sorry. Uh, that was great,

06:05.824 --> 06:09.125
but, uh, could we try one more,
just a little more up?

06:09.127 --> 06:11.027
Up?

06:11.029 --> 06:12.762
Uh, yeah, you know,

06:12.764 --> 06:14.214
just happier, brighter, chirpy.

06:14.216 --> 06:15.415
You want me to be chirpy?

06:15.417 --> 06:17.300
Don't say yes.
Yes! Here's a little trick

06:17.302 --> 06:18.301
that I learned:

06:18.303 --> 06:20.036
Smile when you talk.

06:20.038 --> 06:21.371
Because when you do that,

06:21.373 --> 06:23.039
people can actually
hear the smile.

06:23.041 --> 06:24.507
Go ahead, uh, try it.

06:28.095 --> 06:29.712
Yeah, you know,
that is very good.

06:29.714 --> 06:31.648
That is a really valuable
suggestion.

06:31.650 --> 06:35.051
I'm so surprised I've never
heard that once before

06:35.053 --> 06:36.719
in my over three decades
riding this mic

06:36.721 --> 06:38.888
for the likes
of Sony Consumer Products,

06:38.890 --> 06:42.225
the Nagano Olympics, MCI,
Mercedes-Benz,

06:42.227 --> 06:43.610
the NFL on CBS,

06:43.612 --> 06:44.894
all before you huffed

06:44.896 --> 06:46.746
your first can
of paint thinner, Spicoli!

06:46.748 --> 06:49.032
SYDNEY:
<i>You know, honestly,</i>

06:49.034 --> 06:50.417
we shouldn't feel
uncomfortable speaking

06:50.419 --> 06:52.118
about adult stuff
in front of each other.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.403
You know, when we're at work,

06:53.405 --> 06:55.538
we're not father/daughter;
we're colleagues.

06:55.540 --> 06:56.756
It's true.
I've discussed

06:56.758 --> 06:58.241
my sexual peccadilloes
with many a coll.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.709
See? There you go.
I mean, you know,

06:59.711 --> 07:01.744
the daughter in me says, "Ew,
gross, that's disgusting."

07:01.746 --> 07:03.680
- Mm-hmm. - But, you know, the
colleague in me says,

07:03.682 --> 07:06.416
"You go get yourself some
lady business, Simon."

07:06.418 --> 07:08.468
Oh, how I wish the colleague
in you hadn't just said that.

07:08.470 --> 07:10.086
Me, too. It really creeped
me out. I'm sorry.

07:10.088 --> 07:11.187
ANDREW:
But we're not finished!

07:11.189 --> 07:12.922
No, but you're finished.
What's wrong?

07:12.924 --> 07:15.692
The boy can't pry his lips
off the bong long enough

07:15.694 --> 07:17.611
- to get the job done.
- Sayonara.

07:17.613 --> 07:18.812
Don't leave!

07:20.698 --> 07:22.249
(sighs)

07:27.188 --> 07:30.874
No, I think Sean Connery
was definitely the best 007

07:30.876 --> 07:32.292
I ever had sex with.

07:32.294 --> 07:34.544
When I grow up,
I want to be you.

07:34.546 --> 07:37.080
Modeling in Paris,
building schools in Kenya.

07:37.082 --> 07:39.165
Well, you had that story
about the dress you bought

07:39.167 --> 07:41.001
that was on sale,
but you also had a coupon.

07:41.003 --> 07:42.285
It was against store policy,

07:42.287 --> 07:44.004
but I was not going
to be denied.

07:44.006 --> 07:45.171
See? You're a rebel.

07:45.173 --> 07:46.456
I am kind of.

07:46.458 --> 07:47.757
Mm-hmm. What'd you
do last night?

07:47.759 --> 07:50.427
I bet it was
something fabulous.

07:50.429 --> 07:51.928
Last night? Let's see.

07:51.930 --> 07:53.513
Ah, made love with Zachary.

07:53.515 --> 07:56.632
Zachary? My... my-my Zachary?

07:56.634 --> 07:58.601
But-but, what, Zachary?
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

07:58.603 --> 07:59.769
He's delightful.

07:59.771 --> 08:01.688
He's like a naughty pool boy.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.740
I've taken him as a lover.

08:03.742 --> 08:07.077
Wow. You take lovers like I take
extra mints at the Sizzler.

08:07.079 --> 08:08.828
No, Zachary is quite different
from the others.

08:08.830 --> 08:11.781
He has the most charming
sex face.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.316
I'm-I'm sorry. The what?
Sex face.

08:13.318 --> 08:14.984
You know,
orgasm face. It's...

08:16.537 --> 08:18.872
Oh, my God, he does not do that!
Do it again! Do it again!

08:18.874 --> 08:20.373
It's more dreamy.

08:20.375 --> 08:21.591
Oh, my God!
Yeah.

08:21.593 --> 08:22.592
Sadly, I must run.

08:22.594 --> 08:23.710
Oh, this was so much fun!

08:23.712 --> 08:24.994
We should plan to do it again.

08:24.996 --> 08:26.763
I never plan.
I'm more of a "drop by" girl.

08:26.765 --> 08:27.764
So drop by sometime.

08:27.766 --> 08:29.599
Au revoir.

08:33.154 --> 08:34.337
SYDNEY:
The design looks great.

08:34.339 --> 08:35.804
They look so happy.

08:35.807 --> 08:37.140
Maybe a little less denture.

08:37.142 --> 08:39.308
Hey. How'd it go
with Helena last night?

08:39.311 --> 08:40.860
You guys talk about me?

08:40.861 --> 08:42.511
Arrogant much?
No, we didn't, actually.

08:42.514 --> 08:43.730
This might surprise you,

08:43.732 --> 08:46.066
but Zach Cropper is not
the center of the universe.

08:46.068 --> 08:47.951
The late Nana Gert
would disagree.

08:47.953 --> 08:49.235
(chuckles)

08:49.237 --> 08:50.620
Don't do that!

08:50.622 --> 08:51.621
Do what?

08:51.623 --> 08:53.456
The face! Don't make that face!

08:53.458 --> 08:56.126
(gasps) You know
it's my "O" face, don't you?

08:56.128 --> 08:57.293
Oh, don't call it that.

08:57.295 --> 08:59.028
At least Helena called
it your "sex face""

08:59.030 --> 09:00.246
which is way less revolting.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.364
So you did talk about me.

09:01.366 --> 09:02.499
Ne, yes. We did.

09:02.501 --> 09:03.550
We talked about you.

09:03.552 --> 09:04.667
We're friends.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.252
Helena has taken me as a friend,

09:06.254 --> 09:07.703
and friends talk about things.

09:07.705 --> 09:09.589
Like your "O" face.

09:09.591 --> 09:10.890
It's pretty great, isn't it?

09:10.892 --> 09:12.509
But it didn't start out
that way.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.561
My earlier one was, mmm,
something less than a triumph.

09:14.563 --> 09:16.846
Oh, confirmed.
It was not a triumph.

09:16.848 --> 09:19.432
It was, like...
(grunting)

09:19.434 --> 09:21.985
Oh, that's it.
It's come a long way.

09:21.987 --> 09:24.437
Say, does anyone have a
cyanide capsule I could borrow?

09:24.439 --> 09:25.855
Oh, I might.

09:25.857 --> 09:27.857
So, when are you
seeing Helena again?

09:27.859 --> 09:30.110
Soon. When are you
seeing Helena again?

09:30.112 --> 09:32.245
Sooner.
I'm on "drop by" stat".

09:32.247 --> 09:33.947
So am I.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.167
(knocking at door)

09:38.035 --> 09:39.035
Sydney.

09:39.037 --> 09:40.787
Hi, girlfriend. I was
not expecting you.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.905
Well, you know,
you said to just drop by,

09:42.907 --> 09:44.958
so I thought I would
just drop by and...

09:44.960 --> 09:45.959
(toilet flushes)

09:45.961 --> 09:48.011
Oh, Zach's here.

09:48.013 --> 09:49.212
God, I'm so sorry.

09:49.214 --> 09:51.965
Did he... did he make the face?

09:51.967 --> 09:54.717
Not quite. This one's a grunter,
not a smiler.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.852
A grunter? Someone new?

09:55.854 --> 09:58.638
Darling, shall we get
breakfast or...?

09:58.640 --> 10:01.808
Or a very uncomfortable brunch
for three?

10:02.610 --> 10:04.727
Hi, piglet.

10:08.513 --> 10:10.831
These images hope to capture
the romance and tenderness

10:10.833 --> 10:13.016
of couples finding love
in their golden years.

10:14.852 --> 10:16.252
Oh...
Gross!

10:17.438 --> 10:18.555
ALL:
Aw...

10:18.557 --> 10:20.190
Kids are gonna see this!

10:21.376 --> 10:23.043
Are we watching
The Walking Dead?!

10:23.045 --> 10:24.711
Okay, is this about me screwing
up the voice-over session?

10:24.713 --> 10:25.829
It's not about you, Andrew.

10:25.831 --> 10:27.230
By the way, I talked to Fred.

10:27.232 --> 10:28.599
He's willing to give
you another shot.

10:28.601 --> 10:31.201
I have jury duty that day
and diarrhea.

10:31.203 --> 10:32.486
That's the spirit.

10:32.488 --> 10:34.321
This is about us.

10:36.324 --> 10:37.440
Look, I understand it might be

10:37.442 --> 10:38.742
awkward for you
if I date Helena,

10:38.744 --> 10:39.876
so I'll never see her again

10:39.878 --> 10:41.078
- if that's what you want.
- Good.

10:41.080 --> 10:42.796
That's what I want.
Oh, come on! Really?

10:42.798 --> 10:44.915
Listen, you told me I should be
out there pursuing people.

10:44.917 --> 10:45.916
She's a person.

10:45.918 --> 10:47.467
(sighs)

10:47.469 --> 10:49.252
Never mind. Forget it.

10:49.254 --> 10:50.954
I'll end it with us.

10:53.257 --> 10:54.424
You really like her, don't you?

10:54.426 --> 10:56.893
Yeah, I do.
I really do.

10:56.895 --> 10:59.930
Even more, I like me
when I'm with her.

11:01.015 --> 11:02.316
You're right.

11:02.318 --> 11:04.234
I'm... I'm happy
for you, honestly.

11:04.236 --> 11:06.219
Cross your heart, hope to die,

11:06.221 --> 11:07.437
stick a finger in your eye?

11:07.439 --> 11:09.040
Been watching a lot
of the Stooges again.

11:09.041 --> 11:11.024
(mimics Curly's
high-pitched whoop)

11:11.026 --> 11:13.076
You know there's something
truly wrong with you, right?

11:13.078 --> 11:14.477
(laughing):
Yeah, big time.

11:14.479 --> 11:15.445
Okay.

11:15.447 --> 11:16.530
Then it's settled.

11:16.532 --> 11:17.981
Away from work, Helena
is your girlfriend

11:17.983 --> 11:18.982
and my friend...
Mm-hmm.

11:18.984 --> 11:19.983
...but at work...

11:19.985 --> 11:21.585
Colleagues.
Just business.

11:21.587 --> 11:23.086
Yeah, we're partners
who don't let

11:23.088 --> 11:24.254
our personal lives intrude.

11:24.256 --> 11:26.239
I'm just glad
you're okay with this.

11:26.241 --> 11:27.591
Helena makes me feel young.

11:27.593 --> 11:29.426
Like my old self, when I could

11:29.428 --> 11:31.595
out-Zach Zach.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.264
Oh, God. Zach.

11:34.266 --> 11:36.350
ZACH: <i>See, this is why the
lover thing is so confusing.</i>

11:36.352 --> 11:37.768
Right? I mean, how many
are you allowed to take?

11:37.770 --> 11:38.802
What are the rules?

11:38.804 --> 11:39.970
It's not about the number, Zach.

11:39.972 --> 11:41.504
It's that one of them
is my father.

11:41.506 --> 11:42.556
Your boss.

11:42.558 --> 11:44.141
A fact that has not escaped me.

11:44.143 --> 11:46.443
Everyone know a pride
can't have two lion kings.

11:46.445 --> 11:48.645
Do you think I should let
him be sexually dominant?

11:48.647 --> 11:50.147
I think this is a conversation

11:50.149 --> 11:51.948
I never wanted to have
about my father.

11:51.950 --> 11:53.349
And thank you, by the way,

11:53.351 --> 11:54.484
for ruining the memory

11:54.486 --> 11:55.736
of my favorite childhood movie.

11:55.738 --> 11:57.070
Oh, hakuna matata.

11:57.072 --> 11:59.122
Look, I just don't want
this little comedy of errors

11:59.124 --> 12:00.323
to hurt us at work, okay?

12:00.325 --> 12:01.325
Or worse, hurt my father.

12:01.326 --> 12:02.876
I do not want
to see him get hurt.

12:02.878 --> 12:04.711
Yeah, he does have
that new knee.

12:04.713 --> 12:05.829
Emotionally, you jerk.

12:05.831 --> 12:06.797
Don't worry.

12:06.799 --> 12:08.799
I'll take care of it.
Thank you.

12:08.801 --> 12:10.050
Although it's not
going to be easy.

12:10.052 --> 12:11.868
I'll never forget the
things Helena showed me.

12:11.870 --> 12:13.003
Big Ben...

12:13.005 --> 12:14.004
Tower of London...

12:14.006 --> 12:15.005
Beefeaters.

12:15.007 --> 12:16.506
Please tell me
you went to England.

12:16.508 --> 12:17.758
No, they're sex acts.

12:17.760 --> 12:19.309
Ew.

12:19.311 --> 12:21.595
(Simon whistling)

12:23.881 --> 12:25.315
Hey, boss.
Hey.

12:25.317 --> 12:27.651
Hey...

12:27.653 --> 12:28.652
Nice sandwich.

12:28.654 --> 12:29.653
Thank you.

12:29.655 --> 12:30.821
You know, making
a great sandwich

12:30.823 --> 12:31.988
is a lot like making love.

12:31.990 --> 12:34.224
It takes care, patience

12:34.226 --> 12:36.276
and a delicate blend
of ingredients.

12:36.278 --> 12:37.894
More than one pickle,
the whole thing's ruined.

12:37.896 --> 12:38.895
(laughs)

12:38.897 --> 12:40.230
Funnu should say that.

12:40.232 --> 12:42.165
Um, I-I wanted to talk
to you about Helena.

12:42.167 --> 12:43.250
Oh, Helena.

12:43.252 --> 12:44.701
As lovely as a poem.

12:44.703 --> 12:46.369
I believe it was
Robert Frost who said,

12:46.371 --> 12:47.954
"Two roads diverging

12:47.956 --> 12:49.790
"in a yellow wood, and I...

12:49.792 --> 12:51.407
I took the one
less traveled by."

12:51.409 --> 12:52.626
Yeah.

12:52.628 --> 12:53.910
Turns out it's actually
been traveled before.

12:53.912 --> 12:56.096
Quite recently, in fact. Really?

12:56.098 --> 12:57.881
We have something in
common, you and I.

12:57.883 --> 12:58.882
Besides great hair?

12:58.884 --> 13:00.300
(laughing)

13:00.302 --> 13:01.918
Uh, Fred's here,
and he looks angry, so...

13:01.920 --> 13:03.520
Helena has taken
us both as lovers.

13:04.472 --> 13:06.556
So I was thinking, I
will deal with that. Oh.

13:06.558 --> 13:07.891
I see.

13:07.893 --> 13:09.359
Yeah.
So you and

13:09.361 --> 13:10.777
Helena are...
Yeah.

13:10.779 --> 13:12.729
Was it...? Transcendent?
Oh, yeah.

13:12.731 --> 13:15.115
Mmm. Oh, I'm sorry. What
were you gonna say?

13:15.117 --> 13:16.233
Well, not "transcendent"!

13:16.235 --> 13:18.535
Holy hell, how can I
compete with that?

13:18.537 --> 13:21.121
I was feeling like a stud
when my knee didn't give out.

13:21.123 --> 13:22.372
Transcendent?!

13:22.374 --> 13:24.774
I've got pretty good game,
but give a guy a break.

13:24.776 --> 13:26.126
Look, the good news is that

13:26.128 --> 13:28.545
there is an adorable term
for men in our position.

13:28.547 --> 13:29.913
Yeah. Bloody rivals.

13:29.915 --> 13:31.214
Eskimo brothers.

13:31.216 --> 13:32.382
Ha ha ha!
I'm not ready

13:32.384 --> 13:33.783
to be adorable
with you just yet.

13:33.785 --> 13:35.451
Look, S-Simon, I-I get

13:35.453 --> 13:37.420
that this comes as
a bit of a shock,

13:37.422 --> 13:39.089
so I just want you to know that

13:39.091 --> 13:40.623
as my boss and as my friend,

13:40.625 --> 13:42.759
I promise not to steal
her away from you.

13:42.761 --> 13:44.294
Oh.

13:44.296 --> 13:45.729
Well, just out of curiosity,

13:45.731 --> 13:47.297
what makes you think you could?

13:47.299 --> 13:49.933
Hey, you guys,
Helena's here for...

13:49.935 --> 13:50.934
Oh.

13:50.936 --> 13:52.135
So this is happening now.

13:52.137 --> 13:53.186
My transcendent friend Zach here

13:53.188 --> 13:54.154
thinks he can steal

13:54.156 --> 13:55.739
my little mermaid from me.
Oh! Great.

13:55.741 --> 13:57.607
There goes my second
favorite childhood movie.

13:57.609 --> 13:58.608
Just forget it.

13:58.610 --> 13:59.659
I'm gonna finish my sandwich,

13:59.661 --> 14:01.077
and I'm not sharing!

14:01.079 --> 14:02.279
(grunts) Boss, boss,
let me just...

14:02.281 --> 14:04.314
No, I got it. I-I can
help you with that.

14:04.316 --> 14:06.816
Geez.

14:06.818 --> 14:08.168
Oh, God, don't make that face!

14:08.170 --> 14:10.370
I got it, I got it.
(grunting)

14:10.372 --> 14:11.838
Oh! Oh, God.
No grunting, Dad. I...

14:11.840 --> 14:13.673
(grunting) Oh, God, please!

14:13.675 --> 14:14.958
For God's sake,
I'm your daughter!

14:14.960 --> 14:16.376
No, no grunting! I got it,
I got it, I got it...

14:16.378 --> 14:18.595
Ah!

14:18.597 --> 14:19.763
Let her be!

14:19.765 --> 14:21.348
This is exactly what I was
afraid would happen.

14:21.350 --> 14:22.498
Look, we need to settle this.

14:22.500 --> 14:23.800
Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah.

14:23.802 --> 14:24.834
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:24.836 --> 14:25.886
Yeah.
Yeah.

14:25.888 --> 14:27.003
(laughs)

14:27.005 --> 14:28.171
I don't know why
everyone is so upset.

14:28.173 --> 14:29.505
I enjoy you both,

14:29.507 --> 14:31.024
but we're just lovers.
Uh-huh.

14:31.026 --> 14:32.526
I love having sex with you...
Thank you.

14:32.528 --> 14:34.344
...I love having sex with you...
Bless you.

14:34.346 --> 14:36.012
...and I love talking about it with you.
What's the problem?

14:36.014 --> 14:38.064
I think you just summed
it up pretty well.

14:38.066 --> 14:39.783
Really this just crosses
way too many boundaries.

14:39.785 --> 14:41.952
Like a clown car
of complications.

14:41.954 --> 14:43.119
Not to mention it violates

14:43.121 --> 14:44.354
all the rules
of client service.

14:44.356 --> 14:45.855
I thought that I serviced
the client pretty well.

14:45.857 --> 14:47.290
So did I, right?
You both did

14:47.292 --> 14:48.375
a lovely job. SYDNEY: Oh, God.

14:48.377 --> 14:49.709
Look, Helena.

14:49.711 --> 14:51.527
I love our friendship...
I really do...

14:51.529 --> 14:52.629
but because of it,

14:52.631 --> 14:54.530
I know way too many
gross things about them.

14:54.532 --> 14:55.916
You know too much about us?

14:55.918 --> 14:57.884
Uh, what about Cheryl and
your "college lesbian" phase?

14:57.886 --> 14:59.719
SIMON: How about the year
you grew pot in Mendocino?

14:59.721 --> 15:01.137
That month that
you spent stripping

15:01.139 --> 15:02.722
at that little place in Reno.

15:02.724 --> 15:03.924
I told you those things
in confidence.

15:03.926 --> 15:05.091
And at least two of them

15:05.093 --> 15:06.726
aren't even true.
HELENA: You lied to me?

15:06.728 --> 15:08.812
I-I thought
everyone knew.

15:08.814 --> 15:11.348
I just wanted to seem...
European, you know?

15:11.350 --> 15:13.733
I wanted you to like me.
I do like you.

15:13.735 --> 15:15.518
But you like me, too, right?
Of course.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.020
More than me? I already
told you that I'm not

15:17.022 --> 15:18.271
gonna steal her... Will
you stop saying that!

15:18.273 --> 15:19.239
Guys, enough!

15:19.241 --> 15:20.273
Okay, this cannot continue.

15:20.275 --> 15:21.557
No, clearly not.

15:21.559 --> 15:23.243
You're making this
all so awkward.

15:26.781 --> 15:28.164
Helena, wait.

15:28.166 --> 15:29.399
Did she show you the Beefeater?

15:29.401 --> 15:30.867
Oh, I love it so much.

15:36.980 --> 15:39.565
LAUREN:
You can do this.

15:39.567 --> 15:41.067
Is he a monster?
Yes.

15:41.069 --> 15:42.869
Are you a professional
monster slayer?

15:42.871 --> 15:44.770
No, because that's not a thing.

15:44.772 --> 15:45.955
But I believe in you.

15:45.957 --> 15:47.890
(laughs weakly)

15:47.892 --> 15:48.925
Uh, so...

15:48.927 --> 15:50.076
we got everything
from last time.

15:50.078 --> 15:51.043
It was terrific.

15:51.045 --> 15:52.829
All we need right now
is the tag,

15:52.831 --> 15:54.747
"Musk, do not be afraid"

15:54.749 --> 15:55.948
and then we're good.

15:55.950 --> 15:57.967
Any way you want to do it.

15:57.969 --> 16:00.136
Fine.

16:00.138 --> 16:03.122
Laying it down in three, two...

16:04.224 --> 16:05.424
Musk.

16:05.426 --> 16:06.476
Donut be afraid.

16:06.478 --> 16:08.845
All right,
that's a wrap on Fred.

16:08.847 --> 16:10.563
Did he just say,
"Donut be afraid?"

16:10.565 --> 16:12.014
Yeah.

16:12.016 --> 16:13.232
Yeah, uh, that was terrific.

16:13.234 --> 16:14.600
We just need one
more for safety.

16:14.602 --> 16:17.019
Again, it's,
"Musk, do not be afraid."

16:17.021 --> 16:18.855
Any way you want to do it.

16:18.857 --> 16:19.739
All right, fine.

16:19.741 --> 16:20.973
- "Do not be afraid"
- Fine.

16:20.975 --> 16:22.992
(sighs) Take number two.

16:22.994 --> 16:25.328
In three, two...

16:26.663 --> 16:27.813
Muskdonot...

16:27.815 --> 16:28.831
be afraid.

16:28.833 --> 16:31.083
All right, then,

16:31.085 --> 16:32.168
tail lights on Fred.

16:32.170 --> 16:33.369
Well?
Do something.

16:33.371 --> 16:34.486
Uh, yeah, we just
need one more,

16:34.488 --> 16:35.588
and then we're gonna be good.

16:35.590 --> 16:36.822
FRED:
No, that was my last take.

16:36.824 --> 16:38.791
There's a black and tan
with my name on it.

16:38.793 --> 16:39.709
Good night, rookie.

16:39.711 --> 16:40.960
Oh, no.
He's leaving.

16:40.962 --> 16:43.012
(deep voice): Put those
headphones back on.

16:43.881 --> 16:45.798
What was that?
You heard me.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.300
No, I didn't.
You forgot to push down

16:47.302 --> 16:49.168
the damn button
again, you moron.

16:49.170 --> 16:50.669
Oh.

16:51.522 --> 16:53.222
I said, put those
headphones back on.

16:53.224 --> 16:55.841
We're not done
until say we're done.

16:55.843 --> 16:57.693
Well, look at you.

16:57.695 --> 17:00.679
Tough guy with three inches
of soundproof glass between us.

17:00.681 --> 17:01.898
I'd really like to hear you

17:01.900 --> 17:03.015
come in this room

17:03.017 --> 17:04.317
and say that to my face.

17:06.185 --> 17:08.186
To my face.

17:12.125 --> 17:13.376
Tell my sisters
that I love them.

17:13.377 --> 17:14.710
Okay.

17:18.832 --> 17:20.531
Closer.

17:23.136 --> 17:24.502
Now...

17:24.505 --> 17:25.471
say it.

17:25.473 --> 17:27.223
Well, so much has happened,

17:27.224 --> 17:29.541
I forgot what it was
that we were gonna...

17:29.543 --> 17:32.094
No. Wait.

17:32.096 --> 17:34.096
You put those
headphones back on.

17:34.098 --> 17:36.015
You're not done until
I say you're done.

17:39.719 --> 17:42.238
Erase my browser history!

17:42.240 --> 17:43.739
FRED:
You're shaking.

17:43.741 --> 17:46.192
Like a young Chihuahua.

17:46.194 --> 17:47.159
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

17:47.161 --> 17:48.778
You followed your fear

17:48.780 --> 17:50.229
and it brought you here,

17:50.231 --> 17:52.064
right into my arms.

17:52.066 --> 17:54.083
That's right.

17:54.085 --> 17:55.734
You passed the test.

17:55.736 --> 17:58.037
You earned my respect.

17:58.039 --> 18:01.740
So all this was just
a teachable moment?

18:01.742 --> 18:03.409
I was grasping a boy,

18:03.411 --> 18:04.961
and now I release...

18:04.963 --> 18:07.346
a man.

18:07.348 --> 18:09.415
I have only one more thing
left to say to you.

18:12.219 --> 18:13.219
Musk.

18:13.221 --> 18:15.888
Do not be afraid.

18:15.890 --> 18:17.089
I'm not anymore.

18:17.091 --> 18:19.591
Then get the hell out of here...

18:19.593 --> 18:20.559
Mandrew.

18:20.561 --> 18:22.561
Mandrew...

18:23.730 --> 18:25.898
I-I can't even begin to
tell you how sorry I am

18:25.900 --> 18:27.450
that everything
got so complicated.

18:27.452 --> 18:29.435
How about from now on we just
respect each other's boundaries

18:29.437 --> 18:30.769
and we will refocus
on your account?

18:30.771 --> 18:32.771
Are you sure I'm not
complicating things

18:32.773 --> 18:34.440
just by standing
here in the lobby?

18:34.442 --> 18:36.709
Will I be crossing a boundary
when I get in the lift?

18:36.711 --> 18:38.461
(French accent):
It's not you. It is us, huh?

18:38.463 --> 18:40.413
You know, in Europe,
sex is a good thing, you know?

18:40.415 --> 18:42.999
<i>Fraternité, egalité,</i>
<i>sexualité,</i> ah? (Chuckles)

18:43.001 --> 18:44.450
(Texan twang):
But this is America.

18:44.452 --> 18:46.952
We like our sex shameful,
the way God intended it to be.

18:46.954 --> 18:48.387
That's why Mormons
make love standing up...

18:48.389 --> 18:49.922
so the Big Guy
thinks they're dancing.

18:49.924 --> 18:51.123
I now know things

18:51.125 --> 18:53.059
about my daughter
I wish I didn't,

18:53.061 --> 18:54.176
whether they're true or not.

18:54.178 --> 18:55.227
Mostly not.
It's okay.

18:55.229 --> 18:56.679
But at the end of the day,

18:56.681 --> 18:57.847
even though she's my colleague,

18:57.849 --> 18:59.682
she'll always be
my little girl first.

18:59.684 --> 19:00.683
And I'm her dad.

19:00.685 --> 19:02.101
I like that.

19:02.103 --> 19:03.152
My sexually neutered dad.

19:03.154 --> 19:04.136
No offense.

19:04.138 --> 19:06.022
Some taken.
Not neutered.

19:06.024 --> 19:07.306
And we really hope
that you don't,

19:07.308 --> 19:09.525
but if you choose to take
your accounts elsewhere,

19:09.527 --> 19:10.743
we will understand.

19:11.828 --> 19:13.996
And miss all this
delicious complication?

19:13.998 --> 19:14.997
Not a chance.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.482
(chuckling)

19:16.484 --> 19:17.483
You three...

19:17.485 --> 19:18.501
so delightful.

19:18.503 --> 19:20.036
And so American.

19:20.038 --> 19:21.587
FRED: The recording is
completely finished.

19:21.589 --> 19:24.707
And your toad-licking
lad there grew a pair.

19:24.709 --> 19:26.792
A magnificent pair.
Indeed they are.

19:26.794 --> 19:27.760
Well, hello.

19:27.762 --> 19:28.994
Hello.

19:28.996 --> 19:32.164
In a world where love is blind

19:32.166 --> 19:33.849
but only the blind can see,

19:33.851 --> 19:34.833
one beautiful woman

19:34.835 --> 19:36.969
and one powerful man will unite

19:36.971 --> 19:39.772
to change the fate
of all mankind.

19:39.774 --> 19:41.440
Really?

19:41.442 --> 19:42.992
Tell me more.

19:43.977 --> 19:46.345
What just happened?

19:46.347 --> 19:50.449
I've taken her for a lover.

19:50.451 --> 19:52.485
Is it me, or is she
actually just a psycho?

19:52.487 --> 19:54.286
I wonder if we'll
ever see her again...

19:54.288 --> 19:56.122
or if she's disappeared
from our lives

19:56.124 --> 19:58.741
like a sexually
omnivorous Mary Poppins.

19:58.743 --> 20:00.376
Ruined.

20:00.378 --> 20:01.377
Good job, Stretch.

20:01.379 --> 20:02.461
Mmm.
Wish I could say

20:02.463 --> 20:04.163
I always knew you
had it in you,

20:04.165 --> 20:05.331
but if honesty's
the best policy,

20:05.333 --> 20:07.717
let's just call this
a delightful surprise.

20:07.719 --> 20:10.052
I think that's the nicest thing
you almost ever said to me.

20:10.054 --> 20:12.505
Syd, just to satisfy
my own curiosity,

20:12.507 --> 20:14.840
out of the naughty things
you told Helena you didn't do,

20:14.842 --> 20:16.342
which is the one that you did?

20:16.344 --> 20:17.843
Not answering.

20:17.845 --> 20:19.395
Stripping in Reno.
Can't hear you.

20:19.397 --> 20:20.513
My money's on the pot.

20:20.515 --> 20:21.731
Going to my happy place.

20:21.733 --> 20:23.215
College lesbian phase.

20:23.217 --> 20:24.216
I was young.

20:24.218 --> 20:25.234
Yes!

20:25.236 --> 20:26.652
- BOTH: Don't make the face.
- Sorry.

20:26.654 --> 20:30.835
<font color="#40bfff">Sync & corrections by</font> <font color="#FFA500">wilson0804</font>
<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

20:32.493 --> 20:34.860
Ah! Mr. Melamed, it
is such an honor.

20:34.862 --> 20:36.362
My name is Andrew,
and I'll be...

20:36.364 --> 20:37.747
You don't really need to.

20:37.749 --> 20:39.532
Oh, sorry.

20:39.534 --> 20:41.283
(laughing)

20:41.285 --> 20:42.752
Oh...

20:42.754 --> 20:44.086
(laughing)

20:45.122 --> 20:46.455
(high-pitched voice):
Such an honor!

20:46.457 --> 20:48.624
Confirmed, it was not a triumph.

20:48.626 --> 20:49.625
It was, like...

20:49.627 --> 20:51.794
(imitates evil laugh):
Oh ho ho ho ho!

20:51.796 --> 20:53.579
Ee hee hee hee!

20:53.581 --> 20:55.264
(growling)

20:55.266 --> 20:56.915
(whinnies)

20:56.917 --> 20:58.684
(high-pitched grunting)

20:58.686 --> 21:00.553
Oh ha ha ha ha ha!

21:00.555 --> 21:02.471
(whispering):
What's wrong with you?

21:03.356 --> 21:05.024
MAN: Once more, from the top.
(laughing)
