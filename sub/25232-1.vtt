Ladies and gentle critters,

subjects of
the forest kingdom,

01:45.188 --> 01:48.108
we are the Dukes

01:48.191 --> 01:50.068
My brother, Duke Runt,

01:50.151 --> 01:53.113
is here to make
an important announcement.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.489
Take it away!

01:54.572 --> 01:56.074
Thank you, Duke Stinky.

01:56.491 --> 01:58.910
Princess Claudette
will soon arrive.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.371
Please bow respectfully
when she does.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.838
Claudette, just pretend
the caribou are bowing.

02:11.714 --> 02:13.800
Greetings,
my kind subjects.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.511
Hark! Where
is my Prince Fleet?

02:16.970 --> 02:19.347
[Fleet] I am here,
my fair princess.

02:21.474 --> 02:24.227
[Claudette]
Fleet, the prince
of nobility,

02:24.477 --> 02:25.645
of awesomeness,

02:26.563 --> 02:28.064
of fleetness!

02:30.692 --> 02:33.069
We're ready to receive
the visiting bear royalty.

02:33.278 --> 02:35.947
Lady Agnes, please make

Lady Agnes, stop!

02:54.799 --> 02:57.010
[fanfare ends]

02:57.969 --> 02:59.095
Introduce the Bear King.

02:59.178 --> 03:01.347
Sorry, I was just
getting into it.

03:01.598 --> 03:02.807
[clears throat]

03:03.266 --> 03:05.101
Ladies and gentle critters,

03:17.906 --> 03:20.408
Hey, sorry,
I was napping.

03:21.618 --> 03:23.536
[scoffs] Brent!
We can't play
Animal Kingdom

03:23.620 --> 03:24.996
if you don't play
the role correctly.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.874
True royalty inspires
and leads!

03:28.416 --> 03:30.668
[Stinky] Fearless,
active, courageous!

03:30.752 --> 03:32.420

And awake!

03:36.382 --> 03:40.303

-Game over.

03:40.595 --> 03:43.348
So much for practicing
for the Queen Bear's arrival.

03:43.681 --> 03:45.266
Speaking of the Queen,
where is she?

03:45.558 --> 03:46.976
Hopefully she gets
here soon,

03:47.227 --> 03:48.895
so we can see her
and get back home.

03:49.187 --> 03:52.899
Yeah, 'cause if Mom and Dad
find out we came all the way
to the Eastern Forest,

03:53.149 --> 03:55.193
we'll get
a royal punishment!

03:55.526 --> 03:58.529
Speaking of royal, look!
The royal messengers.

03:58.613 --> 04:01.616
[birds chirping]

04:08.706 --> 04:10.959
Oh, no! My bird phobia!

04:24.138 --> 04:26.724
Donna, if those
two gents don't hurry up
and ask us out--

04:26.808 --> 04:28.685
Seriously, Marge,
what are they
waiting for?

04:28.935 --> 04:30.603
Don't they know glamour
when they see it?

04:30.979 --> 04:32.438
[belches]

04:33.606 --> 04:36.359
Ohhhh, look, hold on.
Royal birdie alert.

04:40.905 --> 04:43.950
[birds chirping]

04:44.534 --> 04:45.994
Marge, did you hear that?

04:46.244 --> 04:49.414
Yes! The Bear Queen
and Princess Canue
are coming!

04:50.331 --> 04:51.499
We need to clean up!

05:08.141 --> 05:09.392
[Beast]
WHAT!

05:11.894 --> 05:15.440
All I ask for is five
solid hours of sleep.

05:16.149 --> 05:18.526
and leave the morning
calls to the roosters,
would ya?

05:18.735 --> 05:20.903
Alright, I'm coming.
Don't get your feathers

05:21.195 --> 05:23.823
in a twist,
you bunch of squeaky--

05:24.240 --> 05:26.284
Oh, royal birds.

05:26.617 --> 05:29.037
[chirping]

05:29.120 --> 05:31.956
The Bear Queen
and Princess Canue
are coming?

05:32.540 --> 05:34.125
I gotta get
this place fixed up.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.669
Oy, okay, you Nutters!

05:38.796 --> 05:41.883
Spiff this forest up.
Royalty's on the way!

06:04.072 --> 06:06.157
Canue, where is your crown?

06:06.407 --> 06:08.451
Magpie brought it
ahead of time for me.

06:08.534 --> 06:12.288
Are you not excited for
your first state visit
to the Eastern Forest?

06:12.705 --> 06:13.831
So excited, Mother.

06:14.290 --> 06:15.958
I sure wish Father
could have come.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.002
You know the rules, Canue.

06:18.294 --> 06:21.047
One royal must always
guard the kingdom.

06:22.256 --> 06:24.884
Your Majesty, we've
almost reached our
destination.

06:25.384 --> 06:26.552
I'll secure the area.

06:26.886 --> 06:29.889
-Claw will
stay here with you.
-Thank you, Strom.

06:30.431 --> 06:34.352
It is a shame this
region has fallen into
the paws of Rogue Wolves.

06:34.811 --> 06:37.688
But it is safe
now, right?

06:38.106 --> 06:41.275
Yes, Your Majesty.
I visited just
two weeks ago.

06:41.734 --> 06:42.819
There was no
sign of them.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.987
Well, they do tend
to move on.

06:46.989 --> 06:48.741
[overlapping chatter]

06:48.825 --> 06:52.245
Greetings, everyone,
I'm Magpie,
Head of Protocol.

06:52.537 --> 06:55.081
When you see Queen Bear
and Princess Canue,

06:55.206 --> 06:56.791
bow until they pass.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.711
So, which one is Vernon?

07:01.337 --> 07:02.338
It is I.

07:02.547 --> 07:04.173
Did you get
the royal tune?

07:04.298 --> 07:06.217
Ah, si.  We are ready.

07:07.176 --> 07:09.512
[bagpipe music playing]

07:09.720 --> 07:12.223
How's the pitch?
You like? Eh?

07:12.348 --> 07:13.558
Perfect.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.898
Your Highness,
the Eastern Forest

07:20.982 --> 07:22.650
has been prepared
for your entrance.

07:22.942 --> 07:23.985
Thank you, Magpie.

07:24.193 --> 07:27.613
I'm just waiting for Strom
to confirm the safety
of the area.

07:27.947 --> 07:29.323
[Strom] All's well,
Your Majesty.

07:29.657 --> 07:32.452
Canue, I'll go out first
and introduce you.

07:32.869 --> 07:34.287
Now, get your crown on.

07:34.871 --> 07:37.874
[overlapping chatter]

07:42.879 --> 07:45.298
Ladies and gentle critters,

07:45.715 --> 07:48.968
I am proud to present
the sovereign matriarch

07:49.051 --> 07:52.346
of the Sovereign Bear Kingdom
and her territories,

07:52.722 --> 07:56.142
Her Royal Majesty
Queen Bear.

07:56.225 --> 07:58.644
[cheers and applause]

08:04.025 --> 08:07.028
[chittering]

08:14.452 --> 08:15.411
Greetings.

08:15.661 --> 08:18.789
Queen Bear,
you're so beautiful.

08:19.207 --> 08:20.500
Oh, thank you.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.126
And that crown kills it!

08:25.046 --> 08:27.006
Hello. Nice to meet you.

08:27.381 --> 08:28.758
Beast is my name.

08:29.217 --> 08:31.511
The Nutters of
the Eastern Forest

08:31.636 --> 08:35.681
proudly present... nuts!

08:36.140 --> 08:38.683
Thank you, Beast.
Thank you, Nutters.

08:40.061 --> 08:41.187
Did you hear that, boys?

08:41.437 --> 08:43.438
She said my name-- Beast!

08:43.523 --> 08:45.441
Ach! Gets me
right in the ticker.

08:47.818 --> 08:49.237
Hello, young wolves.

08:49.779 --> 08:51.072
Hello, Your Highness.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.783
We don't live in
the Eastern Forest.

08:54.116 --> 08:55.618
We're from
the Western Forest.

08:55.868 --> 08:57.537
Our grandfather's
the leader out there.

08:57.745 --> 09:01.082
You must be
the grandpups
of Winston and Eve,

09:01.499 --> 09:04.210
and your parents
are Kate and Humphrey.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.255
I met them once.
Lovely wolves.

09:07.755 --> 09:09.173
Give them my best.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.385
Well, we can't,
Your Majesty,

09:12.468 --> 09:14.971
because we
snuck over here.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.807
If they found out we went
to the Eastern Forest,

09:17.890 --> 09:19.642
we'd be in
a lot of trouble.

09:20.101 --> 09:21.602
Naughty, naughty.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.605
Hello, there.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.482
Ooh!

09:26.566 --> 09:29.110
[sings grating fanfare]

09:38.995 --> 09:41.706
I've been practicing
all week for this moment.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.332
All right, thank you.

09:43.749 --> 09:47.044
That was a very
committed performance.

09:47.503 --> 09:50.006
And it's so nice
to meet you, young bear.

09:50.548 --> 09:53.926
[snoring]

09:54.969 --> 09:56.304
Ohh! Uhh!

09:56.887 --> 09:58.931
What an honor,
Your Highness.

10:02.518 --> 10:04.895
Ladies and gentle critters,

10:04.979 --> 10:08.024
I present Princess Canue.

10:10.443 --> 10:14.280
[up-tempo music playing]

10:17.491 --> 10:18.909
Whoa!

10:19.160 --> 10:22.038
[pleased reactions]

10:24.498 --> 10:26.834
[music continuing]

10:30.212 --> 10:33.966
We're here at the welcoming
ceremony of Queen Bear
and Princess Canue.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.801
Don't they look great,
Marge?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.637
Donna, the Queen's
looking very stately

10:37.720 --> 10:39.138
in a traditional
regal crown,

10:39.430 --> 10:41.098
and, oh, the Princess's
head piece,

10:41.682 --> 10:42.767
Pippa couldn't top it.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.275
[humming]

10:51.400 --> 10:53.402
[awestruck reactions]

10:54.278 --> 10:56.113
A bit over the top,
is it not?

10:56.322 --> 10:57.698
[Magpie]
The young ones love it.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.869
Wow! She's hot!

11:03.037 --> 11:05.206
She's beautiful, huh?

11:05.498 --> 11:06.916
-Huh?
-[bear grunts]

11:07.333 --> 11:09.669
My name is Brent.
Do you tweet?

11:10.211 --> 11:13.297
No, but I chirp.
[giggles]

11:16.342 --> 11:18.344
Sorry, Mother,
couldn't resist.

11:18.844 --> 11:19.929
Clearly.

11:20.429 --> 11:22.932
Denizens of
the Eastern Forest,

11:23.099 --> 11:26.727
meet my modern daughter,
Princess Canue.

11:26.811 --> 11:29.063
[cheers and applause]

11:32.358 --> 11:34.735
[menacing growling]

11:37.696 --> 11:39.365
[howling]

11:39.990 --> 11:41.367
[gasps]
Rogue wolves!

11:42.243 --> 11:45.788
[howling]

11:48.290 --> 11:50.501
[panicked cries]

11:51.043 --> 11:54.004
If those rogues think
they're gonna touch
those crowns,

11:54.255 --> 11:56.298
they'll feel the wrath
of our antlers!

11:58.050 --> 12:00.344
[roar]

12:01.554 --> 12:04.473
Magpie, get Canue
out of here now. Now!

12:04.682 --> 12:06.267
Come this way,
Princess Canue!

12:06.392 --> 12:10.938
No, Mother. You said a Queen
never fears, and always leads.

12:11.021 --> 12:13.023
As your mother
and your Queen,

12:13.107 --> 12:15.025
I order you to go-- now!

12:22.533 --> 12:26.662
[panicked cries]

12:30.708 --> 12:33.085
[roars]

12:34.253 --> 12:36.297
[howling]

12:37.548 --> 12:39.049
Okay, Nutters.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.929
Ready... aim... fire!

12:46.223 --> 12:47.224
[wolves yelp]

12:47.933 --> 12:50.352
You young critters,
please leave now.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.687
Go to your homes.

12:52.271 --> 12:53.772
We want to help you,
Queen Bear.

12:53.981 --> 12:56.525
We know this forest.
We can take you
to a safe spot.

12:58.569 --> 13:00.321
Then please help Canue.

13:00.571 --> 13:01.655
But go now!

13:05.326 --> 13:09.038
Rogue wolves,
as Sovereign Queen
of the Bear Kingdom,

13:09.246 --> 13:10.873
I command you to halt!

13:13.584 --> 13:16.295
This is our forest.
You're not my queen.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.381
The forest belongs
to all of its inhabitants.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.218
Shouldn't you be
at Bear Lake?

13:22.801 --> 13:24.011
Get me the Princess!

13:26.639 --> 13:28.265
[yelp]

13:31.435 --> 13:34.313
[wolves snarling]

13:44.949 --> 13:46.033
Princess Canue!

13:47.284 --> 13:48.452
Princess Canue!

13:50.079 --> 13:51.789
Princess Canue!
Princess Canue!

13:52.831 --> 13:55.376
The Queen sent us to help you.
Let's find a place to hide.

13:59.255 --> 14:01.131
Alert the kingdom
we have been attacked.

14:14.979 --> 14:17.815
[screaming roar]

14:20.442 --> 14:23.487
Sire! Sire!
You can't go
to the Eastern Forest.

14:24.280 --> 14:27.783
Remember, one leader
must always stay
to guard the capital.

14:28.826 --> 14:30.202
Then you stay here, Louis.

14:31.245 --> 14:34.331
I'm not royalty, Sir.
I'm just your chief advisor.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.834
My Queen and my daughter.

14:38.711 --> 14:39.920
I shouldn't have
let them go.

14:40.796 --> 14:42.381
Strom told me
it was safe.

14:44.091 --> 14:45.467
What is your
counsel, Louis?

14:45.759 --> 14:48.262
They want to lure you
into the Eastern Forest,

14:48.596 --> 14:50.222
capture you
and take over
the kingdom.

14:50.806 --> 14:52.516
I shall send
troops instead.

14:52.766 --> 14:54.643
What do the Rogue Wolves
want of us bears?

14:54.935 --> 14:57.479
We can't help them create
an alpha wolf race.

14:57.855 --> 15:00.357
[Louis] Oh, indeed
you can, sire.

15:01.108 --> 15:04.945
He who controls the water
controls the valley.

15:06.530 --> 15:09.033
Send a message to our allies,
the Western Wolves.

15:09.450 --> 15:10.534
Ask for Winston.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.956
[wolves snarling]

15:17.249 --> 15:19.084
[gripping music playing]

15:25.758 --> 15:27.134
[snarling]

15:29.762 --> 15:30.721
This way.

15:44.568 --> 15:46.737
[grunts, yelps]

15:48.656 --> 15:49.990
Very smart, Stinky.

15:50.074 --> 15:52.201
An obstacle course
will slow them down.

15:52.284 --> 15:53.994
We've got to break
these wolves up.

15:54.078 --> 15:54.995
Agnes!

15:55.996 --> 15:58.791
Excuse me, I've got
to make some road kill!

16:00.876 --> 16:02.044
What is she doing?

16:02.127 --> 16:03.504
Being underestimated.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.174
Oh, look, a porcupine!

16:07.508 --> 16:08.759
We're so afraid!

16:09.760 --> 16:12.221
[singing fanfare]

16:12.304 --> 16:13.597
[grunt, yelp]

16:16.058 --> 16:17.559
[Stinky]
One down, one to go.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.688
And the one is gaining
on us very quickly!

16:20.771 --> 16:22.314
[snarl, yelp]

16:22.398 --> 16:24.775
[Canue] Is there a way
we can use his speed
against him?

16:24.984 --> 16:26.235
My mother
taught me that.

16:27.027 --> 16:27.945
Good idea.

16:28.112 --> 16:30.364
I've learned a lot of things
from my mother too,

16:30.489 --> 16:32.449
like a spinout.
It's simple.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.660
You plant your
front paws in the dirt

16:34.743 --> 16:36.036
and shift
your weight backward,

16:36.537 --> 16:37.830
right before that!

16:40.582 --> 16:41.458
Got it!

16:41.542 --> 16:43.460
But first,
we need a dust-up.

16:43.544 --> 16:45.796
Make 'em eat dirt--
literally.

16:48.632 --> 16:51.802
When I say "now,"
everyone spin to the left!

16:53.470 --> 16:54.513
Now!

16:57.808 --> 16:59.893
[screams]

16:59.977 --> 17:01.603
[hard landing, yelp]

17:02.646 --> 17:05.232
Oh, yeah, another one
bites the dust.

17:14.450 --> 17:15.867
[birds chirping]

17:17.578 --> 17:20.329
Oh. Royal messengers
of the Bear King?

17:20.414 --> 17:22.790
-[chirping]
-Mm-hmm? Mm-hmm? I see.

17:25.252 --> 17:27.212
Winston,
come out here, please.

17:27.628 --> 17:30.424
[Winston]
What is it, Eve?
I'm doing my business.

17:30.674 --> 17:33.135
Winston, royal birdies
from the King Bear are here.

17:33.343 --> 17:34.553
They need to talk to you.

17:38.724 --> 17:40.934
Hello. I'm Winston.

17:41.101 --> 17:43.020
[chirping]

17:43.562 --> 17:46.607
The Queen Bear was
attacked by Rogue Wolves,

17:47.107 --> 17:49.193
and Princess Canue
is missing,

17:49.777 --> 17:52.112
but was last seen
with our grandpups?

17:53.697 --> 17:56.033
Tell the Bear King
that help's on the way.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.581
[howling]

18:02.664 --> 18:05.918
[howling echoes]

18:10.464 --> 18:11.799
Now, that's refreshing.

18:12.174 --> 18:13.300
Mm-hmm.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.969
Cool mountain water
sure hits the spot.
[chuckles]

18:16.345 --> 18:19.598
[resounding howl]

18:20.224 --> 18:22.184
That's my father.
Let's go, Humphrey.

18:22.476 --> 18:24.603
Wow, Kate, I haven't
heard a howl like that

18:24.686 --> 18:26.897
since I was late
getting you home
after our first date!

18:28.649 --> 18:30.275
The pups were supposed
to be out scouting,

18:30.359 --> 18:32.444
and they went all the way
to the Eastern Forest?

18:32.945 --> 18:33.987
Wait a minute.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.865
There they are with...

18:37.241 --> 18:38.492
Princess Canue?

18:44.039 --> 18:45.290
You guys better go home.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.167
We're in a
heap of trouble.

18:49.419 --> 18:52.548
Oh, please, come in.
Make yourself comfortable.

18:52.756 --> 18:54.216
What a day you've had.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.135
Oh, where are
my manners?

18:59.179 --> 19:01.265
Eve, what are you doing?

19:01.598 --> 19:02.724
It's called a curtsy!

19:05.811 --> 19:07.729
A very low curtsy.

19:09.231 --> 19:10.315
Thank you, Eve.

19:10.607 --> 19:13.735
Princess Canue,
we're sorry to hear
about your mother.

19:14.027 --> 19:15.112
Are you hungry?

19:15.362 --> 19:16.655
He only chewed one side.

19:16.905 --> 19:18.365
The other side's clean.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.160
Oh, where are my manners?
This is royalty.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.953
Fillets are in order.

19:23.245 --> 19:25.706
Caribou or moose?
I'll go make a quick kill.

19:26.415 --> 19:27.875
I'm fine, thank you.

19:28.417 --> 19:30.085
So, our pups saved you?

19:30.502 --> 19:33.505
[chuckles] I hope
they didn't go to
the Eastern Forest,

19:33.755 --> 19:35.507
where the
Rogue Wolves are.

19:35.674 --> 19:37.801
They'd be very
grounded if they did.

19:37.885 --> 19:39.845
Uh, we did, Dad.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.597
You are so grounded.

19:41.805 --> 19:45.559
Well, actually,
the pups saved my life.

19:46.185 --> 19:49.271
They were kind, brave
and selfless.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.857
You have
wonderful children.

19:54.651 --> 19:56.278
So, are we
still grounded?

20:01.366 --> 20:05.204
Sorry to barge in, but we
came to borrow a cup
of caribou broth.

20:05.287 --> 20:08.040
Ah, for once
the gossip is true.

20:08.498 --> 20:10.250
Princess Canue is here.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.836
Well, don't just
stand there, bird. Bow.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.882
It's tragic that
the Queen was attacked.

20:17.758 --> 20:19.009
Nice to meet you both.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.180
Oh, this is Magpie,
Head of Protocol.

20:23.305 --> 20:24.223
Hello.

20:24.932 --> 20:28.435
[romantic music playing]

20:32.564 --> 20:33.482
I saw her first.

20:33.565 --> 20:35.442
I'm sure Magpie would
like to meet something

20:35.525 --> 20:37.903
more than
a peasant-class goose.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.823
I am Paddy,
of royal lineage.

20:42.449 --> 20:47.079
Many flocks ago,
my ancestors swam
in St. James Park...

20:48.080 --> 20:49.289
just outside Buckingham.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.584
Yeah, sure, Paddy--
with pigeons, no less.

20:53.043 --> 20:55.379
I'm Marcel,
of French origin.

20:55.587 --> 20:59.091
Yeah, he's French
if you count Montreal.
[scoffs]

20:59.466 --> 21:01.134
Thank you all
for helping us.

21:01.843 --> 21:04.554
I'm most worried
about my mother,
the Queen.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.223
We'll send support.

21:06.848 --> 21:09.268
Kate and Humphrey will
go to the Eastern Forest.

21:09.768 --> 21:12.312
We will always
be there for our friends.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.153
My thanks to all of you.

21:20.654 --> 21:22.447
[Beast] Oh, it was
nothing, Your Majesty.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.450
The Nutters may be small,
but we're tough.

21:25.742 --> 21:26.785
And we're not gonna let

21:26.868 --> 21:28.996
a bunch of
fashion-challenged
Rogue Wolves

21:29.079 --> 21:30.872
take down the Queen,
right Donna?

21:31.206 --> 21:34.001
Right, Marge.
And let's give it up
for the other caribou.

21:36.795 --> 21:37.921
[snarling]

21:38.005 --> 21:39.339
[soft whimper]

21:40.382 --> 21:41.717
[growl]

21:45.470 --> 21:46.930
[growling]

21:47.306 --> 21:49.099
[dramatic music playing]

22:04.990 --> 22:07.242
Strom and Claw were
a part of this ambush.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.119
I must return
to the King.

22:09.536 --> 22:11.330
There are traitors
working against us.

22:11.538 --> 22:12.831
[Beast]
Okay, my Queen,

22:13.165 --> 22:15.375
let's hatch a plan
to get you back.

22:17.753 --> 22:19.046
How could she
have vanished?

22:19.129 --> 22:20.964
She must be getting help
from the locals.

22:26.470 --> 22:27.429
She's in there!

22:28.013 --> 22:30.432
[wolves howling]

22:30.891 --> 22:32.726
[dramatic music playing]

22:39.524 --> 22:41.860
[chittering]

22:50.077 --> 22:52.579
[Beast] Okay, Nutters,
bite hard!

22:53.622 --> 22:57.209
-[Nutters chomping]
-[wolves yelping in pain]

23:00.170 --> 23:01.505
For the Queen!

23:03.048 --> 23:05.634
Well done, my knights
with furry tails!

23:06.301 --> 23:08.678
[dramatic music playing]

23:23.527 --> 23:25.237
Well done, Lady Donna!

23:43.421 --> 23:44.798
[low growl]

23:47.300 --> 23:49.594
[wolves snarling]

23:54.474 --> 23:56.226
[combat grunts]

24:01.565 --> 24:03.275
She is definitely
the Queen.

24:04.025 --> 24:05.235
Flank them!

24:06.444 --> 24:09.447
[wolves snarling]

24:13.827 --> 24:16.037
[chittering]

24:22.085 --> 24:24.671
Our options are growing
more limited, Your Majesty.

24:25.922 --> 24:27.632
Queen Bear,
we're here to help.

24:28.383 --> 24:29.885
We have
your daughter, Canue.

24:30.177 --> 24:31.928
-She's safe.
-Thank goodness!

24:32.929 --> 24:34.973
We outnumber you!

24:35.640 --> 24:37.809
You think we came
unprepared?

24:37.976 --> 24:41.104
[howling]

24:45.025 --> 24:46.943
Meet the Western pack.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.863
Rogues, back
to the forest!

24:53.116 --> 24:54.576
Oh! That was easy.

24:55.118 --> 24:58.205
Thank you, Kate and Humphrey,
and many thanks to your pups.

24:58.622 --> 24:59.915
They are amazing.

25:00.874 --> 25:02.334
I need to get
to the king.

25:02.751 --> 25:04.252
There are traitors
among the bears.

25:04.502 --> 25:05.587
We'll take you.

25:19.434 --> 25:20.894
The army's ready, sire.

25:28.443 --> 25:30.445
The Rogue Wolves
want our lake.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.823
Its water feeds the valley,
and they want control of it

25:34.199 --> 25:36.701
to extort
the wolf packs
downstream.

25:37.244 --> 25:40.580
This cannot
and will not happen.

25:40.914 --> 25:44.584
[distant howling]

25:45.252 --> 25:47.545
Sire! Strom and Claw!

25:50.799 --> 25:51.841
Your Majesty.

25:52.425 --> 25:53.635
Strom, what happened?

25:53.927 --> 25:56.763
I was wrong.
The area wasn't safe.

25:57.472 --> 25:59.099
It's overrun
with rogues.

25:59.724 --> 26:01.977
I'm afraid they
captured the Queen.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.688
There are 40 rogues,
maybe more.

26:04.896 --> 26:06.815
Then we'll need
the entire army.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.651
[Louis] My Lord,
some should remain
to protect the kingdom.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.821
Louis, if we don't send
adequate reinforcements,

26:12.988 --> 26:14.781
they'll overrun
our entire army.

26:15.365 --> 26:17.158
Claw and I will
protect the King.

26:17.367 --> 26:19.661
Like you protected
the Queen and Canue?

26:19.828 --> 26:20.912
Stop this, now!

26:21.496 --> 26:22.497
Send everyone!

26:23.123 --> 26:26.751
[all roaring]

26:30.380 --> 26:33.091
Traitors! You're
both traitors!

26:33.383 --> 26:35.343
What are you
talking about, Louis?

26:35.468 --> 26:39.139
You fought rogue wolves
while protecting the Queen?

26:39.639 --> 26:42.475
Mm, interesting
not a single injury.

26:42.767 --> 26:46.938
Combat with 40 wolves
would have caused
some injury,

26:47.022 --> 26:48.898
if not fatality.

26:49.024 --> 26:50.775
[laughter]

26:51.359 --> 26:55.113
Very good, Louis.
What a smart advisor.

26:55.697 --> 26:57.615
[impact grunt]

27:07.042 --> 27:08.752
[roars]

27:09.502 --> 27:12.630
[screaming]

27:17.135 --> 27:19.929
Poor King. Poor Louis.

27:20.221 --> 27:24.392
King Strom--
I like the roar of that!

27:25.268 --> 27:28.063
[roaring]

27:34.361 --> 27:35.779
Where are my subjects?

27:36.112 --> 27:38.531
Uh, we just sent them
to the Eastern Forest.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.158
[chuckling]
Uh, hello!

27:40.408 --> 27:43.286
Oh, right. Well, the Rogues
should be here soon

27:43.370 --> 27:44.871
for their first state visit.

27:52.379 --> 27:54.923
[snoring]

27:57.384 --> 27:58.551
[whispering]
I have to go.

27:59.052 --> 28:01.054
I have a feeling
Mother survived,

28:01.638 --> 28:04.015
but I also have a feeling
my father's in trouble.

28:04.307 --> 28:07.060
It's very dangerous there,
Princess Canue.

28:07.143 --> 28:11.564
A queen always leads,
inspires, and is fearless.

28:12.399 --> 28:13.900
Spoken like your mother.

28:14.734 --> 28:16.820
[all snoring]

28:20.240 --> 28:22.700
You guys wake up.
Canue's gone.

28:29.707 --> 28:31.418
Princess Canue!
Princess Canue!

28:32.293 --> 28:33.670
Oh, hello.

28:33.878 --> 28:35.130
We noticed
you were gone.

28:35.213 --> 28:36.714
I have to go back
to the kingdom.

28:37.632 --> 28:40.927
Strom and Claw
are traitors.
I can feel it.

28:41.761 --> 28:44.931
They told us the area was
safe, then we got attacked.

28:45.265 --> 28:46.599
Then let us escort you.

28:46.766 --> 28:49.227
Yeah, 'cause we know
every shortcut in the valley.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.271
We can lead you there
in half the time.

28:51.688 --> 28:53.356
Clearly. Let's go.

28:58.653 --> 29:01.906
The King sent the bear army
into the Eastern Forest
to find me.

29:02.115 --> 29:05.744
I am confident that Beast,
Marge and Donna will
steer them right.

29:06.244 --> 29:08.121
The bear army's
very loyal.

29:08.413 --> 29:10.707
But now Strom
has the Rogues
on his side.

29:10.915 --> 29:12.542
The Rogue Wolves
and the traitors

29:12.625 --> 29:14.210
will never
cooperate well.

29:15.462 --> 29:18.006
We must divide
and conquer.

29:19.007 --> 29:21.593
Yes, the Rogue Wolves
will soon be arriving.

29:22.010 --> 29:23.386
Wow, strong women.

29:24.137 --> 29:26.097
Well, when
the Rogue Wolves arrive,

29:26.556 --> 29:30.226
why don't I go and divide
and then you two can conquer.

29:30.685 --> 29:31.728
Got an idea?

29:31.895 --> 29:33.480
Ever heard
of a Trojan wolf?

29:36.191 --> 29:37.275
[geese honking]

29:37.484 --> 29:38.902
Hey, you four!

29:40.028 --> 29:41.321
Where's the royal music?

29:41.654 --> 29:42.697
Ah, si.

29:44.991 --> 29:48.328
[bagpipe music playing]

29:49.037 --> 29:51.748
Oh, look, the Rogue
Wolves are arriving.

30:01.549 --> 30:04.093
[chittering]

30:04.803 --> 30:05.887
Hey!

30:08.139 --> 30:09.432
I am Sir Evin,

30:09.891 --> 30:11.768
Sergeant-at-Arms
of the royal family.

30:12.101 --> 30:14.229
-I'm Donna.
-And I'm Marge.

30:14.896 --> 30:16.105
And I'm Beast.

30:16.189 --> 30:17.857
