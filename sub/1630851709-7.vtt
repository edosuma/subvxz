█

00:01.034 --> 00:07.607
reads words on screen

00:10.076 --> 00:13.313
<i>Tonight, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

00:15.081 --> 00:18.585
The first ever Camp Paradise
Twisted Talent Show.

00:18.651 --> 00:19.786
Either I'm gonna
realize we have some

00:19.853 --> 00:21.354
very talented people here...

00:21.421 --> 00:22.856
Oh!

00:22.922 --> 00:25.358
Or, cringe fest 2021.

00:25.425 --> 00:29.028
How does it feel to be Vay's
second pick after me?

00:29.095 --> 00:31.998
- Oh!
-

00:32.065 --> 00:34.467
Iva is coming in hot.

00:34.534 --> 00:36.636
I like you.
I don't like any other guys.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.405
I think you are smoking hot.

00:38.471 --> 00:39.439
Thank you.

00:39.506 --> 00:41.574
This is honestly the only
connection I have had.

00:41.641 --> 00:45.045
Are we gonna kiss to see
if we combine?

00:45.111 --> 00:47.480
I was upset to see you
like walk away

00:47.547 --> 00:48.815
hand in hand with
another girl.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.450
I think it's only right for
me to, you know,

00:50.517 --> 00:51.618
pursue other options.

00:51.684 --> 00:53.086
If I can't trust you
then I'm out.

00:53.153 --> 00:54.888
If you want to get to
know me, like, I'm here.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.089
Love to get to know you.

00:56.156 --> 01:00.527
I'm upset that I wasted
my date card.

01:00.593 --> 01:03.830
I really wanna go home.
This is so dumb.

01:03.897 --> 01:05.598
-
- [Beep]!

01:07.000 --> 01:08.401
No matter what I do tonight,

01:08.468 --> 01:10.737
a lot of people are
gonna get hurt.

01:10.804 --> 01:12.572
Maria...

01:12.639 --> 01:14.841
Don't keep mentioning
the same girl.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.342
It makes me feel shit.

01:16.409 --> 01:18.411
He's definitely
prioritizing Maria.

01:18.478 --> 01:20.380
I just don't like
repeating myself.

01:20.447 --> 01:23.082
I just want to know where
your priority's at. Pick.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.119
If I am wrong, put me in
my place right now.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.121
I, I don't even know
what to say.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.856
Cluster

02:49.936 --> 02:51.070
Did you talk
to Brendan M.?

02:51.137 --> 02:53.506
Apparently he said to Maria,

02:53.573 --> 02:55.208
"I really want to kiss you
right now, but I can't.

02:55.275 --> 02:57.443
I have to talk to someone."

02:57.510 --> 02:58.811
Oh...

02:58.878 --> 03:00.713
Last night was weird.
Brendan M. and Maria

03:00.780 --> 03:03.783
come back from their date,
and it is awkward.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.451
It's our date couple.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.819
- Hey, what's up guys?
- Hi!

03:06.886 --> 03:09.956
- Hi, guys.
- Did you kiss?

03:10.023 --> 03:13.126
-
- I feel like they kissed.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.694
I honestly have no idea
what's going on with

03:14.761 --> 03:15.828
Brendan M. and Angela.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.830
I thought they were the
tightest couple in Paradise so,

03:17.897 --> 03:19.832
seeing him go on a date
really shocked me.

03:19.899 --> 03:21.868
- Hey, Brendan.
- What's up?

03:21.935 --> 03:22.936
Yo, what's good, bro?

03:23.002 --> 03:25.071
The look on his face last
night when he got back,

03:25.138 --> 03:27.840
I just know that Brendan M.
is not as into Angela

03:27.907 --> 03:29.175
as she is into him.

03:29.242 --> 03:32.478
And that is a deadly situation
waiting to explode.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.581
When you rolled in,
the energy was off.

03:34.647 --> 03:35.582
It shifted.

03:35.648 --> 03:37.250
And then everyone asked
if you guys kissed...

03:37.317 --> 03:38.952
And you didn't say anything.

03:39.018 --> 03:40.853
We both have that right
to not, you know,

03:40.920 --> 03:42.555
disclose what we did
on our date.

03:42.622 --> 03:44.757
Yeah, it was just- I don't know,
the energy was just weird.

03:44.824 --> 03:47.827
If Angela wasn't here,
is Maria like your type?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.028
Yeah, she's...

03:49.095 --> 03:50.797
honestly, like, our
conversation was just,

03:50.863 --> 03:53.233
it was smooth. It was just,
the date was great.

03:53.299 --> 03:54.767
I love what Ange and I have.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.536
You know, I don't, I don't
want to ruin that.

03:56.603 --> 03:58.938
But like, if someone were to
come into Paradise and we both

03:59.005 --> 04:02.508
agree that we want to make sure
that we're not closing any

04:02.575 --> 04:05.945
other options off, I, I still
want to be open, you know.

04:06.012 --> 04:07.647
I don't know, we'll see
what happens.

04:07.714 --> 04:09.148
What do you think of Brendan?
Do you like him?

04:09.215 --> 04:12.018
He's cute, but I think
he's just like...

04:12.085 --> 04:13.820
It's gonna be kind of hard
in any situation

04:13.886 --> 04:14.887
you're in right now.

04:14.988 --> 04:17.690
I am very interested in
getting to know Brendan M.

04:17.757 --> 04:21.995
However, he mentioned
having something else.

04:22.061 --> 04:25.098
So, at this moment,
I don't know...

04:25.164 --> 04:29.035
if it's something that I
should continue or not.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.805
If, if it's something that
like, is actually...

04:32.872 --> 04:35.675
like working, I don't want
to get in between.

04:35.742 --> 04:36.843
Well, that's not your
fault though.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.044
No one told you.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.646
I'm really happy
you're here.

04:39.712 --> 04:42.548
But at the same time,
it's like, [beep],

04:42.615 --> 04:45.251
I have one less person that
like would be interested in me.

04:45.318 --> 04:47.186
Yeah, that's true.

04:47.253 --> 04:49.889
- Hey, hey!
- Does he have a date card?

04:49.956 --> 04:51.724
- Oh, goodness gracious.
- Oh, my God.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.127
- Check it out!
- Oh!

04:54.193 --> 04:55.862
- Woo!
- Oh, baby.

04:55.928 --> 04:57.830
Stuff's getting c-razy!

04:57.897 --> 05:00.033
-
- Wow!

05:00.099 --> 05:02.635
We got a Twisted Tea card here.

05:02.702 --> 05:04.103
"Campers...

05:04.170 --> 05:07.106
It's...

05:07.173 --> 05:08.641
show time!"

05:08.708 --> 05:10.276
- Oh, God...
- Oh, God!

05:10.343 --> 05:11.978
Ho-ho, put me in, coach.

05:12.045 --> 05:14.714
"Meet us at the theatre".

05:14.781 --> 05:16.049
- No...
- No.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.984
"Kevin and Astrid".

05:18.051 --> 05:20.820
- Theatre?
- Theatrical performances.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.156
My anxiety is immediately
going through the roof.

05:23.222 --> 05:24.724
I don't want to perform.

05:24.791 --> 05:26.893
I don't want to
perform anything.

05:26.959 --> 05:28.327
No...

05:28.394 --> 05:31.030
So, are you excited?
Drama queen.

05:31.097 --> 05:34.300
Drama queen!
No, I don't have any drama.

05:34.367 --> 05:37.270
I think there are a handful of
people that are excited.

05:37.336 --> 05:40.173
And a handful of people
that are terrified.

05:41.174 --> 05:42.341
Oh, no.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.210
It better not be a
talent competition.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.813
It's some sort of talent show,
I'm not down.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.682
It looks like the whole group
is performing today.

05:49.749 --> 05:52.018
And I'm like instantly...

05:52.085 --> 05:54.387
freaking the 'F' out.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.056
- Let's do it, man.
- Astrid's here.

05:57.123 --> 05:58.658
Oh, wait,
Kevin and Astrid?

05:58.725 --> 06:00.326
Yeah, I just said it's from
Kevin and Astrid.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.829
Oh, oh, Astrid!

06:02.895 --> 06:04.831
I'm so pumped up to see Astrid.

06:04.897 --> 06:06.833
I consider her a
really good friend.

06:06.899 --> 06:08.868
And literally, seeing Astrid...

06:08.935 --> 06:10.970
could not come at a better time.

06:11.037 --> 06:13.005
Oh, I might cry.

06:18.411 --> 06:19.746
Okay, hey guys,
good to see ya.

06:19.812 --> 06:21.380
- Guys!
- Hey!

06:21.447 --> 06:23.216
So, I decided today
to take the day off

06:23.282 --> 06:24.817
from pouring you
guys drinks...

06:24.884 --> 06:27.186
and I thought instead we
could have a little fun.

06:27.253 --> 06:28.688
So, I brought the
queen of fun with me.

06:30.923 --> 06:32.892
This is my fiancée and
mother-to-be...

06:32.959 --> 06:34.227
- Astrid.
- Aw!

06:34.293 --> 06:37.063
I respect Kev and Astrid for...

06:37.130 --> 06:39.732
taking the leap into Paradise.

06:39.799 --> 06:41.834
And coming out the
other end with...

06:41.901 --> 06:43.703
a family on the way...

06:43.770 --> 06:45.271
and a beautiful life together.

06:45.338 --> 06:46.406
As most of you know,
Astrid and I met

06:46.472 --> 06:47.540
on the beach of Paradise,
ourselves.

06:47.607 --> 06:50.076
And one of the first one on one
conversations we had...

06:50.143 --> 06:52.812
she told me how passionate
she is about volunteering

06:52.879 --> 06:54.914
as a camp councillor
every summer in LA.

06:54.981 --> 06:56.949
So, there's lots of things
I love about

06:57.016 --> 06:58.050
being a camp councillor.

06:58.117 --> 07:01.354
But my absolute favourite thing
is the talent show.

07:03.322 --> 07:05.691
The talent show kind of lets
the campers show

07:05.758 --> 07:07.059
a different side
of themselves.

07:07.126 --> 07:09.362
One that you typically
wouldn't get to see.

07:09.428 --> 07:11.164
So, good news, ha.

07:11.230 --> 07:13.466
- I hope.
-

07:13.533 --> 07:15.101
You guys are all gonna
get the shot...

07:15.168 --> 07:16.969
to show your
fellow campers...

07:17.036 --> 07:19.272
what you got,
in the first ever...

07:19.338 --> 07:22.241
Camp Paradise Twisted
Talent Show.

07:25.545 --> 07:28.714
Yay...

07:28.781 --> 07:31.717
So, we'll be judging you
guys on talent.

07:31.784 --> 07:33.853
But we're also looking
for creativity.

07:33.920 --> 07:36.088
Some personality,
lots of energy.

07:36.155 --> 07:38.191
And there'll be a great
reward for the camper

07:38.257 --> 07:39.258
we deem the winner.

07:39.325 --> 07:41.093
So, leave it all out there
and give it all you got.

07:41.160 --> 07:45.064
I think the Twisted Tea
Talent Show reveals...

07:45.131 --> 07:46.899
insecurities in our campers.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.968
We're looking for if people
are too scared to make

07:49.035 --> 07:50.236
a bit of a fool
of themselves.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.004
So, I'm looking for a
few people that I...

07:52.071 --> 07:54.106
I have in mind to really step
out of their shell and,

07:54.173 --> 07:55.475
and perform.

07:55.541 --> 07:58.144
We'll give you guys some
time to practice your act.

07:58.211 --> 08:00.847
And, have fun. And we'll
see you guys onstage.

08:00.913 --> 08:02.482
Thanks, guys, thank you!

08:02.548 --> 08:03.449
Alright!

08:03.516 --> 08:05.218
All I know coming into
this talent show is

08:05.284 --> 08:07.086
what Kevin's kind of
been telling me.

08:07.153 --> 08:09.422
So, I'm excited to see them
kind of reveal a different side

08:09.488 --> 08:12.058
about themselves by
showcasing their talents.

08:12.124 --> 08:13.860
- I'm so stressed out.
- Me too.

08:13.926 --> 08:15.161
We look like idiots.

08:17.063 --> 08:19.765
What can we do that- what
can you do that's good?

08:19.832 --> 08:21.100
Nothing.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.835
Kamil and I, we didn't
really have too much talent.

08:22.902 --> 08:24.237
But you know, we'll,
we'll make it work.

08:24.303 --> 08:25.972
We'll figure it out and
just keep it simple.

08:28.040 --> 08:28.808
Do you know
what you're doing?

08:28.875 --> 08:30.276
Is looking beautiful
not a talent?

08:32.278 --> 08:33.946
- Are we doing our group dance?
- I don't know.

08:34.013 --> 08:35.248
Like...

08:35.314 --> 08:38.317
I haven't done any sort of
talent show since

08:38.384 --> 08:40.853
I was at summer
camp as a kid.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.456
I'm just hoping that me and
my girls in cabin 24

08:43.523 --> 08:46.092
can do something fun
and lighthearted.

08:46.158 --> 08:47.059
I feel like everyone here-

08:47.126 --> 08:48.861
like a lot of people are
talented musically.

08:48.928 --> 08:50.396
A lot of people can like
play instruments.

08:50.463 --> 08:53.933
I'm a little worried because
I cannot sing, dance,

08:54.000 --> 08:55.968
act, create anything.

08:56.035 --> 08:57.937
I'm just really
good at talking.

08:58.004 --> 09:00.373
My talent is being
an audience member.

09:10.316 --> 09:11.384
I've known Angela for years.

09:11.450 --> 09:14.520
She was actually on my original
season of The Bachelor.

09:14.587 --> 09:16.088
We did Paradise together.

09:16.155 --> 09:18.391
Kevin's kind of been telling
me what's been going on.

09:18.457 --> 09:20.526
I want to talk to my girl
a little bit and

09:20.593 --> 09:22.161
see if she's okay.

09:22.228 --> 09:24.030
You honestly couldn't have
come at a better time.

09:24.096 --> 09:26.198
Yesterday was such an emotional
rollercoaster for me.

09:26.265 --> 09:28.401
Like honestly, I was
all over the place.

09:28.467 --> 09:30.136
I wanna hear
what's going on.

09:30.202 --> 09:32.405
Brendan M. and I,
we've been like talking about

09:32.471 --> 09:34.373
the future outside
of here already.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.242
And then, a new girl came
in yesterday

09:36.309 --> 09:38.511
and asked him on a
date, and he went.

09:38.577 --> 09:39.979
So, it kinda like...

09:40.046 --> 09:41.247
shook me to my core.

09:41.314 --> 09:42.515
- I don't like that.
- Yeah.

09:42.581 --> 09:44.250
Did he kiss her on the date,
or...?

09:44.317 --> 09:46.552
So, I haven't got to
ask him that yet

09:46.619 --> 09:48.287
because we haven't had time.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.855
Would that be a deal breaker?

09:49.922 --> 09:52.258
I mean, I did kiss Josh
on my date.

09:52.325 --> 09:54.460
However, that was like...

09:54.527 --> 09:57.263
forever ago, and our
relationship was not

09:57.330 --> 09:58.965
as escalated then.

09:59.031 --> 10:00.866
Right, well, you obviously
wanna like,

10:00.933 --> 10:02.501
believe in the new relationship.

10:02.568 --> 10:04.503
But you also have to
protect yourself.

10:04.570 --> 10:07.440
Like, you don't wanna
ignore a red flag.

10:07.506 --> 10:08.641
Am I being an idiot?

10:08.708 --> 10:10.543
No, I just think like, yeah,

10:10.610 --> 10:12.111
you wanna have the
Paradise experience.

10:12.178 --> 10:13.879
But at the end of the day,
in order for the

10:13.946 --> 10:15.481
relationship to work
in the real world,

10:15.548 --> 10:18.250
you have to treat it like
real life a little bit.

10:18.317 --> 10:20.987
And, if you're kind of
starting out with doubt,

10:21.053 --> 10:22.521
like how do you build
on that, you know?

10:22.588 --> 10:25.224
The Paradise experience to
me is meeting someone

10:25.291 --> 10:27.426
that you're gonna build
a life with after this.

10:27.493 --> 10:29.595
Not dating a bunch
of random girls.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.331
I think he was upset
with me a little bit, too,

10:32.398 --> 10:35.167
that like I didn't handle it
how he wanted maybe.

10:35.234 --> 10:36.569
I'm not sure, but he
just said like,

10:36.635 --> 10:38.938
"You should trust me
and like,

10:39.005 --> 10:41.107
you should believe in
what you and I have".

10:41.173 --> 10:43.476
I don't like that he like
tried to turn it around on you

10:43.542 --> 10:45.578
a little bit because your
feelings were valid.

10:45.644 --> 10:48.080
That's what I mean, my mind
is just like everywhere.

10:48.147 --> 10:52.084
Well, don't like hold back in
letting him know...

10:52.151 --> 10:53.352
how it hurt you either.

10:53.419 --> 10:55.488
Because, if you don't
completely tell him

10:55.554 --> 10:57.957
how it made you feel, then
you're just gonna keep that

10:58.024 --> 11:01.093
kind of stuff pent up and it's
not gonna get better, so...

11:01.160 --> 11:03.029
It's like I don't want
to be an idiot,

11:03.095 --> 11:05.331
but I also can't ignore
my heart. And like,

11:05.398 --> 11:07.566
so I just don't know what's...

11:07.633 --> 11:09.068
gonna happen from here.

11:09.135 --> 11:10.069
For sure.

11:10.136 --> 11:11.470
Angela is a really smart girl.

11:11.537 --> 11:15.041
I think she kind of knows
what her gut is telling her.

11:15.107 --> 11:17.410
And I just hope she
gets some time to

11:17.476 --> 11:19.278
figure those things
out with him.

11:19.345 --> 11:21.280
I just don't want you to end
up in the same situation

11:21.347 --> 11:22.715
you've ended up in before.

11:25.785 --> 11:26.652
<i>Coming up...</i>

11:26.719 --> 11:28.954
Iva is coming in hot.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.556
Are you flirting
with other girls?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.458
Are you still into me?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.627
Should I like pursue
other things?

11:34.693 --> 11:36.062
She's hammering me.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.363
So, if you like me tonight,

11:37.430 --> 11:38.697
rather than the
girl you're with...

11:38.764 --> 11:40.700
I could sense a desperation.

11:40.766 --> 11:44.637
Pull me aside and
give me a kiss.

11:44.703 --> 11:47.473
I don't wanna be looking over my
shoulder at every moment.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.008
Did you kiss her though?

11:49.075 --> 11:50.710
It, it's kind of strange,
you know?

11:50.776 --> 11:52.445
- Um...

12:14.366 --> 12:15.768

Sexy Bob Ross,
you know?

15:57.323 --> 15:59.358
Now, let's make those
bigger, oh, okay.

16:01.360 --> 16:06.065
- Ah!
- Vay?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.000
I like to call myself Boob Ross.

- Stacy?
- It's Vay!

Whoever said Stacy,
you're canceled.

16:12.237 --> 16:15.140

she really nailed it...

16:15.207 --> 16:18.377
with all of Vay's personalities.

16:18.444 --> 16:20.245
That was good.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.014

16:22.081 --> 16:25.317
So far my early favourite, Lisa.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.529

16:37.596 --> 16:39.131
I want to see my girl
move her body.

16:39.198 --> 16:41.433
I mean, that's kind of sexy
to see a girl dancing.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.309
Whoa!

16:50.376 --> 16:53.479
Yes!

16:53.545 --> 16:54.613
Adorable.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.315
I'd want to date them
if I was a guy.

16:56.382 --> 16:57.750
Maybe not winning
the talent show.

16:57.816 --> 16:59.318
But I love the effort.

17:05.724 --> 17:07.493
Everyone was
giving their best.

17:07.559 --> 17:09.261
It's really interesting to
kind of see the

17:09.328 --> 17:11.130
personalities come out.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.298
You know, I am no comedian.

17:13.365 --> 17:16.068
But I've heard I can
make y'all laugh.

17:16.135 --> 17:19.038
I've heard that I have
like a very loud...

17:19.104 --> 17:20.773
laugh.

17:20.839 --> 17:25.344
Once upon a time, there was a
beautiful girl named Bianka.

17:25.411 --> 17:29.048
Who had high hopes of falling
in love in Paradise.

17:29.114 --> 17:31.250
I want you guys to
repeat after me.

17:31.316 --> 17:33.619
We are all amazing people.

17:33.685 --> 17:35.621
And we deserve amazing things.

17:35.687 --> 17:38.057
We are all
amazing people.

17:38.123 --> 17:40.526
And we deserve amazing things.

17:40.592 --> 17:42.261

17:42.327 --> 17:45.364
Allow me then to
reintroduce myself.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.733
Voila, in view...

17:47.800 --> 17:50.335
a humble,

17:53.505 --> 17:55.107
Okay.

17:55.174 --> 17:56.742
That's why it works,
that's why it works.

17:56.809 --> 17:59.711
I didn't really understand
Stacy's performance.

17:59.778 --> 18:01.246
Ha-haah!

18:02.848 --> 18:04.483
Is that a talent, like...?

18:04.550 --> 18:06.718
I love the girl, but I...

18:06.785 --> 18:07.719
I have no idea.

18:07.786 --> 18:09.488
Josh!

18:11.590 --> 18:13.459
- Wow... okay.
- Wow.

18:24.670 --> 18:29.107
It is so attractive to see
somebody with talent.

18:29.174 --> 18:31.143
Damn, didn't know a piano
could get me going.

18:49.328 --> 18:50.762
There you go, guys,
thanks a lot.

18:50.829 --> 18:52.431
That was amazing.

19:01.240 --> 19:02.808
Brendan S. is a
confident guy.

19:02.875 --> 19:06.245
And I'm kind of awkward
funny sometimes.

19:06.311 --> 19:08.814
So, maybe like him and I
together could, you know,

19:08.881 --> 19:10.749
possibly be the winner
of the talent show.

19:10.816 --> 19:12.651
We're, we're doing a little...

19:12.718 --> 19:13.886
little roast tonight.

19:13.952 --> 19:15.387
Oh-ho...

19:15.454 --> 19:16.655
Alright, guys, you ready?

19:16.722 --> 19:18.757
- Alright.
- Have, have fun.

19:18.824 --> 19:22.794
After being poked on a lot here
in Paradise, I, I feel like...

19:22.861 --> 19:24.630
One guy has it coming for him.

19:24.696 --> 19:25.797
Oh, I feel the same way.

19:27.466 --> 19:28.767
Space cowboy Joey.

19:28.834 --> 19:29.902
Oh!

19:29.968 --> 19:31.570
- Hey, Joey?
- What's up, buddy?

19:31.637 --> 19:33.172
How does it feel...

19:33.238 --> 19:35.607
to be Vay's second
pick after me?

19:35.674 --> 19:37.543
Oh!

19:37.609 --> 19:40.212
Feels like I'm with her.

19:40.279 --> 19:41.547
I'm gonna throw this
one out here.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.582
Mike...

19:43.649 --> 19:44.716
Are you really here for Stacy?

19:44.783 --> 19:45.884
'Cause if you didn't have the
rose power this week,

19:45.951 --> 19:49.621
would you really be bouncing
around from girl to girl?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.424
- Hilarious!
-

19:52.491 --> 19:53.692
Just a little jab.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.495
This is not a roast,
it's just...

19:56.562 --> 20:00.365
a spew of crappy insults.

20:00.432 --> 20:04.303
It's hurting me to
watch this train wreck.

20:04.369 --> 20:05.771
- Caitlin, my girl.
- This is a good one.

20:05.837 --> 20:07.205
Oh... what?

20:07.272 --> 20:09.808
Caitlin, if frog leg Adam
walked in...

20:09.875 --> 20:12.844
what did you think kissing
him would it take, ah-

20:12.911 --> 20:15.247
sorry, do over,
do over, do over.

20:15.314 --> 20:17.716
-
- Do over, do over!

20:17.783 --> 20:21.553
If frog-leg Adam walked in,
did you think kissing a frog

20:21.620 --> 20:23.622
would turn him
into a prince?

20:23.689 --> 20:25.624
-
- Oh God.

20:25.691 --> 20:27.292
The only two clowns
I'm seeing right now

20:27.359 --> 20:29.494
are those two
in front of me.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.863
I don't think they quite
understand the definition of

20:31.930 --> 20:34.266
a roast ́cause one,
it's supposed to be funny.

20:34.333 --> 20:37.803
And two, they really gotta
work on their delivery.

20:37.869 --> 20:41.340
Stacy, I think you're
mistaking Camp Paradise for,

20:41.406 --> 20:42.975
for band camp
with that laugh.

20:43.041 --> 20:44.910
- What?
- I don't get it.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.345
Hoo-hoo!

20:47.846 --> 20:50.282
- Ah...
- What?!

20:50.349 --> 20:53.719
Iva, we all know you're here
for the wrong reasons.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.287
I know you want that blue
check mark for that

20:55.354 --> 20:56.822
music career
that you...

20:56.888 --> 20:58.257
you think you have, so...

20:58.323 --> 20:59.658
it's not, it's not looking
too good for you.

20:59.725 --> 21:00.993
I think it is.

21:02.427 --> 21:04.663
It's not funny.
You guys suck.

21:04.730 --> 21:05.864
Right on.

21:05.931 --> 21:08.634
There's a better chance of
Chris coming back to Paradise...

21:09.568 --> 21:11.336
Than these two with
a comedy career.

21:11.403 --> 21:12.871
Yeah, there's a couple more.
We'll keep it simple though.

21:12.938 --> 21:14.339
But thanks, guys,
we love you all.

21:14.406 --> 21:16.508
Yeah, no hard feelings, guys.

21:16.575 --> 21:17.943
I don't get it.

21:20.445 --> 21:24.483
It was like,
hard to watch so...

21:25.450 --> 21:27.619
-
- Woof.

21:27.686 --> 21:29.354
-
- It's a roast.

21:29.421 --> 21:30.922
Uh-huh.

21:34.426 --> 21:35.761
Okay, so, my name is Iva.

21:35.827 --> 21:38.330
I'm here to get the blue
checkmark next to my name.

21:38.397 --> 21:40.365
-
- Let's hope it works.

21:40.432 --> 21:42.434
And I'm gonna do a song
that's an original.

21:42.501 --> 21:43.535
It's called ́Lola'.

21:43.602 --> 21:46.305
And it's about
a boss ass girl.

21:51.510 --> 21:53.712

21:53.779 --> 21:56.481

anybody's
musical talent.

I'm seeing a
different side to Iva

22:44.930 --> 22:46.331
when I see her
play that guitar.

22:46.398 --> 22:49.367
She's incredibly talented
and I'm blown away.

22:49.434 --> 22:51.436
♪ AT THE END

22:54.639 --> 22:55.907
Thank you.

22:55.974 --> 22:58.944
Real good.

22:59.010 --> 23:02.647
This performance is entitled
"The Onion Man".

23:02.714 --> 23:03.715
The Onion Man?

23:03.782 --> 23:05.884
And the first layer we're
removing is this one.

23:05.951 --> 23:08.720
- Oh!
- Oh-ho-ho!

23:08.787 --> 23:12.457
Brendan M's performance
is interesting.

23:12.524 --> 23:14.726
- Oh!
- Woo!

23:14.793 --> 23:16.461
- Okay, okay.
- Alright!

23:16.528 --> 23:17.996
- Oh!
- Yeah!

23:18.063 --> 23:18.964
Woo!

23:19.030 --> 23:20.432
I did not know
he could juggle.

23:20.499 --> 23:22.000
That's fascinating,
probably doesn't hurt that

23:22.067 --> 23:23.969
he took his shirt off.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.075
There's more.

23:30.142 --> 23:34.980
I'm gonna introduce you to a
posture known as Locus Pose.

23:35.046 --> 23:37.549
- Whoa, whoa!
- Ooh!

23:37.616 --> 23:39.551
Oh, my God.

23:39.618 --> 23:41.119
I don't know too much
about yoga...

23:41.186 --> 23:43.789
But seeing Brendan, almost
looks like a mating call.

23:43.855 --> 23:46.892
It's like, "Come to me, Angela,"
as he lifts his legs up.

23:50.662 --> 23:51.963
-
- Woo!

23:54.800 --> 23:56.835
We obviously have a really,
really tough decision here.

23:56.902 --> 23:58.703
A lot of people were
actually like talented.

23:58.770 --> 24:00.572
I was impressed.

24:00.639 --> 24:01.873
Okay, first of all,
I have to say

24:01.940 --> 24:03.175
you guys did an
incredible job.

24:03.241 --> 24:05.443
But ultimately we can
only pick one winner.

24:05.510 --> 24:08.413
If I'm going strictly on who
I thought actually was

24:08.480 --> 24:09.948
the most talented,
Brendan M., man.

24:10.015 --> 24:11.149
That juggling and the...

24:11.216 --> 24:12.951
"bleh" thing that he did.

24:13.018 --> 24:14.186
I don't know,
it's some talent.

24:14.252 --> 24:16.521
It's just- Lisa's gotta be
a hard second.

24:16.588 --> 24:17.722
Drawing was really good.

24:17.789 --> 24:20.025
We took a bunch of stuff
into consideration.

24:20.091 --> 24:22.694
Including kind of someone
that needs that time.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.696
I'm kind of in the
doghouse right now.

24:24.763 --> 24:27.599
And, I think this would be a
great opportunity for me to,

24:27.666 --> 24:30.068
you know, just dig myself
out of that hole.

24:30.135 --> 24:34.172
The winner of Camp Paradise
Twisted Talent Show is...

24:46.751 --> 24:48.587
We took a bunch of stuff
into consideration.

24:48.653 --> 24:51.556
Including kind of someone
that needs that time.

24:51.623 --> 24:54.659
Ultimately, we can only
pick one winner.

24:54.726 --> 24:58.563
The winner of Camp Paradise
Twisted Talent Show is...

25:04.502 --> 25:06.137
Brendan M.

25:09.341 --> 25:11.376
Your boy wins.

25:13.812 --> 25:16.748
So, as I said before, there's a
special reward for the winner.

25:16.815 --> 25:19.084
A crazy nice,
super special

25:19.150 --> 25:20.485
one-on-one date
with for tonight.

25:20.552 --> 25:22.087
Who are you choosing?

25:22.153 --> 25:23.755
I am choosing...

25:26.658 --> 25:30.328
- Angela.
- Angela, alright!

25:30.395 --> 25:32.097
Brendan M. definitely
earned the win.

25:32.163 --> 25:34.432
But we're a little biased
́cause we love Angela.

25:34.499 --> 25:35.700
I know he's been through
a lot the last day

25:35.767 --> 25:37.435
or so with the Maria stuff.

25:37.502 --> 25:39.371
And I think they just
need some alone time

25:39.437 --> 25:40.572
to be away from
everyone else.

25:40.639 --> 25:43.708
You two can go get ready.
The rest of you head to camp.

25:43.775 --> 25:45.443
And, thanks for
an amazing show.

25:45.510 --> 25:47.212
- The bar's open!
- Woo!

26:03.461 --> 26:04.896
Thanks for, for coming out.
I wanted to pull you aside

26:04.963 --> 26:06.264
'cause I really didn't
get a chance...

26:06.331 --> 26:07.399
- I know!
- To even meet you.

26:07.465 --> 26:08.233
- At all.
- When you first came in.

26:08.300 --> 26:10.702
I've heard great things
about Josh.

26:10.769 --> 26:12.904
And then I, I saw him earlier
at the talent show and

26:12.971 --> 26:14.506
he was really talented.

26:14.573 --> 26:18.476
So, I'm excited to finally
like sit down with him and

26:18.543 --> 26:19.577
get to know him.

26:19.644 --> 26:22.547
So, I was sitting with Bianka
at the talent show.

26:22.614 --> 26:25.250
And we thought you
were so talented.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.885
We loved it, we loved
your performance.

26:26.952 --> 26:28.486
I really appreciate that.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.255
It's a super personal thing
for me, to be honest,

26:30.322 --> 26:31.189
like playing piano.

26:31.256 --> 26:32.757
So, playing for people
sometimes is like

26:32.824 --> 26:33.992
a bit weird for me.

26:34.059 --> 26:36.227
It felt like there was a lot of
emotion, which was- like,

26:36.294 --> 26:38.330
I feel like that's what
moves people, right?

26:38.396 --> 26:40.365
Josh is super creative.

26:40.432 --> 26:42.634
It feels like I can
relate to someone.

26:42.701 --> 26:44.402
You've been in Paradise
for a little bit.

26:44.469 --> 26:45.503
Yeah.

26:45.570 --> 26:48.673
I'm curious to know just how
that's going for you.

26:48.740 --> 26:50.575
So, yeah, I started spending
a lot of time with Lisa.

26:50.642 --> 26:52.310
Like, we kind of built
this connection.

26:52.377 --> 26:53.945
It was very natural.

26:54.012 --> 26:55.747
To be honest, I don't
know where we're at.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.916
Like, I'm really overdue
for a conversation...

26:57.983 --> 26:59.284
on that.

26:59.351 --> 27:00.652
I think it's something
we're figuring.

27:00.719 --> 27:04.289
- Okay, that's fair.
- Mhm. It's not like you're...

27:04.356 --> 27:07.559
- Locked down, like.
- No, I wouldn't say so. No.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.295
I'm confused about Lisa.
I really care for her.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.330
I definitely have
feelings for her.

27:12.397 --> 27:15.634
I just don't know what kind
of feelings those are.

27:15.700 --> 27:18.603
How do you feel about
this connection?

27:18.670 --> 27:21.539
This, even just this
conversation that we've had?

27:21.606 --> 27:23.842
Honestly, it's probably
been the most

27:23.908 --> 27:26.678
comfortable conversation
that I've had.

27:26.745 --> 27:27.979
- Really?
- Since I got here.

27:28.046 --> 27:28.913
- Yeah.
- Okay.

27:28.980 --> 27:30.882
It's just kind of
flowing better, like...

27:30.949 --> 27:33.451
I don't know, I'm attracted
to you, yeah.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.520
If Lisa wasn't in the picture,

27:35.587 --> 27:38.256
I 100% would be vying
for Maria right now.

27:38.323 --> 27:39.691
I think there's
potential here.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.226
I'm super glad that we
had this conversation.

27:41.292 --> 27:42.961
- Me too, yeah.
- Mhm.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.863
- Finally.
- Yeah, finally.

27:44.929 --> 27:46.898
I need to talk with Lisa,
you know...

27:46.965 --> 27:49.601
Where are at?
Where should we be at?

27:49.667 --> 27:50.702
How do we want to look at this?

27:50.769 --> 27:53.371
I think it's something that
we should definitely...

27:53.438 --> 27:54.973
- Yeah.
- Definitely explore.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.941
I agree, it would be nice.

28:11.890 --> 28:13.491
Oh, my God, wait!

28:13.558 --> 28:14.726
This is so cute.

28:14.793 --> 28:16.828
Going into this date,
I'm excited.

28:16.895 --> 28:19.764
But also, you know, a little
nervous because

28:19.831 --> 28:22.867
there is a lot of pressure
on this conversation.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.370
I've invested a lot
in Brendan M.

28:25.437 --> 28:27.705
And I have true,
genuine feelings for him.

28:27.772 --> 28:30.875
And, if this doesn't go the
way that I'm hoping,

28:30.942 --> 28:33.445
that means Paradise
didn't work for me.

28:33.511 --> 28:34.646
Well, tell me, what's on...

28:34.712 --> 28:36.848
what's on your mind, like,
where's your head at right now?

28:36.915 --> 28:38.717
I was upset.

28:38.783 --> 28:41.052
It was just very strange to
see you like walk away

28:41.119 --> 28:42.620
hand-in-hand with
another girl.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.856
You know, this is my first
time doing this.

28:44.923 --> 28:46.324
You've done this before so,

28:46.391 --> 28:47.492
you have a different
perspective.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.528
I wanted you to trust me and
trust that me going on it,

28:50.595 --> 28:51.596
my intentions were good.

28:51.663 --> 28:54.466
Like what, like what were your
intentions though?

28:54.532 --> 28:57.569
Me going on the date was to
give myself a fair opportunity

28:57.635 --> 29:00.405
to see if there was a
connection there.

29:00.472 --> 29:02.040
For me to get the
most out of this,

29:02.107 --> 29:03.708
I think it's only right for
me to, you know,

29:03.775 --> 29:06.044
pursue other options.
At the same time,

29:06.111 --> 29:08.646
it doesn't take away from
what you and I have.

29:08.713 --> 29:11.549
I was a bit upset at the
fact that you kind of

29:11.616 --> 29:12.851
looked at it that way.

29:12.917 --> 29:14.786
Yeah, okay.

29:14.853 --> 29:18.423
I've tried to be as honest
and vocal about how I feel.

29:18.490 --> 29:20.058
I think when it
comes down to it,

29:20.125 --> 29:22.927
she really just needs to
trust in what we have.

29:22.994 --> 29:25.497
You know, the same way I
trust in what we have.

29:25.563 --> 29:27.632
I feel like in the past,
people have always like

29:27.699 --> 29:28.833
taken me for granted.

29:28.900 --> 29:33.805
That whole situation yesterday
kind of like brought stuff

29:33.872 --> 29:35.874
back to the surface for me.

29:35.940 --> 29:38.676
I think that's part of the
reason why I reacted ́cause

29:38.743 --> 29:40.712
it just seems like this shit
always happens to me.

29:40.778 --> 29:43.548
I don't want to be looking over
my shoulder at every moment.

29:43.615 --> 29:44.949
If I can't trust you,
then I'm out.

29:45.016 --> 29:47.952
I'm frustrated because
I haven't had the

29:48.019 --> 29:50.455
most success in the past.

29:50.522 --> 29:53.658
I get where you're coming from.
But I would've hoped that

29:53.725 --> 29:56.394
you would've trusted that I
would've done the right thing

29:56.461 --> 29:59.430
and acted in a way you know,
that reflected...

29:59.497 --> 30:01.132
you know, how I feel for
you and, you know,

30:01.199 --> 30:02.300
the things that I say to you.

30:02.367 --> 30:05.103
Do you think you're done
exploring relationships here,

30:05.170 --> 30:06.938
or...? Or no?

30:07.005 --> 30:09.874
I feel as though I am, but I
also feel like I deserve

30:09.941 --> 30:13.478
the freedom to be able to
explore something.

30:13.545 --> 30:16.080
I know, like, I don't want to
go on a date with anybody.

30:16.147 --> 30:18.149
And I feel like if we are
out in the real world,

30:18.216 --> 30:20.919
are you always gonna be like,
"Hey, I want to," you know,

30:20.985 --> 30:22.887
"I see a hot girl," like,
you know what I mean?

30:22.954 --> 30:24.923
This is like a whole
dating process.

30:24.989 --> 30:28.126
I want to make sure that I'm
not leaving any unanswered

30:28.193 --> 30:30.795
questions or wondering,
you know, what if?

30:30.862 --> 30:32.063
Okay.

30:32.130 --> 30:34.566
Brendan M. has not done
Paradise before.

30:34.632 --> 30:37.869
And, I don't want him to,
you know,

30:37.936 --> 30:39.904
feel like he's missed out
on this experience.

30:39.971 --> 30:41.139
But like, at the
end of the day,

30:41.206 --> 30:42.807
I know what I bring
to the table.

30:42.874 --> 30:47.145
And, I need him to see this
from my point of view as well.

30:47.212 --> 30:50.782
Did you kiss on your
date last night?

30:50.848 --> 30:52.750
Um...

30:54.819 --> 30:57.422
There was definitely an
opportunity to kiss her.

30:57.488 --> 30:59.123
I explained to her that,
you know,

30:59.190 --> 31:00.692
I have this
connection with you.

31:00.758 --> 31:03.862
And, I wanted to be
respectful of that.

31:03.928 --> 31:05.697
Did you want to
kiss her though?

31:17.308 --> 31:18.610
You know, at this point,
my head

31:18.676 --> 31:20.745
is just kind
of scrambled.

31:20.812 --> 31:23.681
What happened on the date?
Did they kiss?

31:23.748 --> 31:26.150
Is he now
interested in her?

31:26.217 --> 31:27.785
And I just need to
know these things.

31:27.852 --> 31:29.721
Did you kiss her though?

31:29.787 --> 31:33.191
I mean, when you're placed
in a certain setting...

31:33.258 --> 31:35.894
it's kind of strange,
you know, um...

31:39.564 --> 31:42.267
I wouldn't have been opposed
to a kiss, but ultimately,

31:42.333 --> 31:44.502
I wouldn't have wanted to
put myself in that position.

31:44.569 --> 31:45.837
I wouldn't have wanted to,

31:45.903 --> 31:48.539
to do anything to,
to offend you.

31:48.606 --> 31:50.441
That makes me
feel a lot better.

31:52.310 --> 31:54.746
Do you see, like, you and I
working in the real world?

31:54.812 --> 31:56.281
I definitely do.

31:56.347 --> 31:58.216
Like, you see us like
translating out?

31:58.283 --> 31:59.550
- Yeah.
- After this.

31:59.617 --> 32:02.854
Yeah, because I don't want
to leave here in this

32:02.921 --> 32:05.590
beautiful space where
everything is catered to

32:05.657 --> 32:07.525
making a relationship
perfect...

32:07.592 --> 32:10.194
And then go into a world where,
you know,

32:10.261 --> 32:11.562
you have so much
coming at you.

32:11.629 --> 32:12.864
I think we could work too.

32:12.931 --> 32:15.967
So, I'm glad to hear that
you feel the same.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.236
It feels great to talk this
out with Angela.

32:18.303 --> 32:19.871
It just goes to show that,
you know,

32:19.938 --> 32:22.807
our communication is on
point and we're really,

32:22.874 --> 32:24.876
we're really growing in
our relationship.

32:24.942 --> 32:27.211
To moving forward and...

32:27.278 --> 32:29.480
leaving the past
in the past.

32:29.547 --> 32:30.682
- Okay.
- And...

32:30.748 --> 32:32.283
Yeah, looking forward
to the future.

32:32.350 --> 32:34.952
- Okay, cheers.
- Cheers.

32:35.019 --> 32:37.255
I feel like he understands
where I'm coming from.

32:37.322 --> 32:39.824
I'm understanding where
he is coming from.

32:39.891 --> 32:43.261
And I feel like we've come
to like a resolution.

32:43.328 --> 32:45.830
We do want to move forward
with each other and

32:45.897 --> 32:47.832
see what happens
in the future.

32:47.899 --> 32:49.867
So, I feel good.

32:57.842 --> 33:01.946
♪ I CAN'T TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU ♪

33:02.013 --> 33:05.783
♪ I CAN'T SAY
I THINK OF YOU ♪

33:05.850 --> 33:11.489
♪ BUT I KNOW,
YES, I KNOW ♪

33:11.556 --> 33:14.592
♪ WE GOT SOMETHING

33:14.659 --> 33:19.998
♪ GO-OH-OH-ING ON.

33:27.805 --> 33:30.608
It just feels right being in
Brendan M's arms.

33:30.675 --> 33:33.845
In life, people go
through challenges.

33:33.911 --> 33:36.614
And you come out stronger.

33:36.681 --> 33:39.884
Our connection is astronomical.

33:39.951 --> 33:42.353
I see us working, 100%.

33:52.130 --> 33:54.632
Look how well you just fit in
this lap of mine, eh?

33:54.699 --> 33:55.933
A perfect fit.

33:58.503 --> 34:00.705
- What's up?

34:00.772 --> 34:03.074
- Love and bullshit.
- Love and bullshit.

34:03.141 --> 34:05.476
- Okay.
- Um...

34:05.543 --> 34:09.013
So, like, I'm pretty happy
that I found you.

34:09.080 --> 34:10.715
It's crazy.

34:10.782 --> 34:13.684
I've never felt like this and...

34:13.751 --> 34:15.753
I don't know,
I'm done looking.

34:15.820 --> 34:18.022
I don't know if I've ever
felt this way before.

34:18.089 --> 34:20.091
This is a completely
different feeling.

34:20.158 --> 34:23.728
I think I'm finally falling
for someone that

34:23.795 --> 34:26.364
I'm meant to be with and it,
it feels good.

34:26.431 --> 34:28.466
I can spend the rest of my life
with you, I already know.

34:28.533 --> 34:30.835
- How do you know that?
- I don't know, I just know.

34:30.902 --> 34:32.837
Plain and simple.

34:32.904 --> 34:33.938
Same.

34:34.005 --> 34:35.673
He's my favourite person.

34:38.109 --> 34:39.577
I'm falling in
love with you.

34:50.621 --> 34:54.092
I am too, 1000%.

34:54.158 --> 34:57.962
This is getting real real.
And it's a great feeling.

34:58.029 --> 35:01.032
That this isn't just a
Paradise fling.

35:01.099 --> 35:04.001
And that she genuinely
means a lot to me.

35:04.068 --> 35:05.470
All this love and bullshit.

35:05.536 --> 35:06.971
Love and bullshit, babe.

35:08.706 --> 35:11.843
We- I'm, yeah, I'm kind of
in love with her.

35:11.909 --> 35:14.645
I guess all the bullshit's
worth it for love.

35:14.712 --> 35:16.614
That was cute.

35:29.927 --> 35:31.496
Another day in Paradise,
isn't it?

35:31.562 --> 35:32.797
YOLO, see there you go.

35:32.864 --> 35:33.931
No one saw you had
nothing there.

35:33.998 --> 35:35.666
- Still works.
-

35:35.733 --> 35:38.903
- Sit on down.
- And you guys match.

35:38.970 --> 35:42.573
Yeah, happy colours,
happy vibes.

35:42.640 --> 35:43.975
Happy sunshine.

35:44.041 --> 35:45.510
It's almost too
much happiness.

35:45.576 --> 35:47.945
Yeah, we gotta
knock it down.

35:48.012 --> 35:51.048
Anybody excited for tonight?
Nervous for tonight?

35:51.115 --> 35:52.717
Unknown?

35:52.783 --> 35:55.486
Rose ceremony coming up.
Gents in the power this week.

35:55.553 --> 35:57.922
Let's do a little recap.
Me and Vay, power couple.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.957
Ain't nothing breaking us apart.
Brendan M., Ange,

36:00.024 --> 36:01.626
seems like they
solidified things.

36:04.495 --> 36:06.097
Wild card, Josh-Lisa.

36:06.164 --> 36:08.699
I just don't see much of a
spark going there.

36:08.766 --> 36:10.835
Josh had a nice date with
Maria and is gonna have to

36:10.902 --> 36:12.436
see how that kind
of plays out.

36:12.503 --> 36:14.639
But I think the new girls need
to be a touch worried.

36:14.705 --> 36:16.073
They came in at kind of
a tough time.

36:16.140 --> 36:17.775
Not really finding
connections to anybody.

36:17.842 --> 36:19.577
I'm not nervous.

36:19.644 --> 36:20.845
It is what it is, you know,
at this point.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.213
Like whatever
happens, happens.

36:22.280 --> 36:25.216
Like, I feel like my experience
here has been like...

36:25.283 --> 36:27.685
I learned a lot, it was very
knowledgeable.

36:27.752 --> 36:29.554
And I'm grateful for this
experience so,

36:29.620 --> 36:30.655
I have nothing to
be nervous about.

36:30.721 --> 36:31.455
Like, it is what it is.

36:31.556 --> 36:32.657
That's the attitude
I like to see.

36:32.723 --> 36:35.693
That's the GD
attitude I like.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.229
I was kind of misguided.

36:38.296 --> 36:40.598
Don't say yes to a date
if you already have

36:40.665 --> 36:41.732
something going on.

36:41.799 --> 36:45.603
Right now, I feel frustrated in
my experience so far.

36:45.670 --> 36:49.574
Getting like a fair shot
from Brendan M.,

36:49.640 --> 36:51.609
I felt like my time
was just wasted.

36:51.676 --> 36:54.211
I don't blame you.
This is a crazy world.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.181
Like, and it's, it tough.
Honestly, it's not easy.

36:57.248 --> 36:58.349
It can be stressful.

36:58.416 --> 37:01.819
I feel like Josh understands
like where I'm coming from

37:01.886 --> 37:03.120
and what I'm saying.

37:03.187 --> 37:06.624
I feel like
we're connecting.

37:06.691 --> 37:09.493
It's funny because
I'm very shy.

37:09.560 --> 37:11.062
You don't come
across as shy.

37:11.128 --> 37:12.597
You come across as
very confident.

37:12.663 --> 37:13.631
I am confident.

37:13.698 --> 37:15.933
You can be shy and confident
at the same time.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.969
More introverted,
but also like...

37:18.035 --> 37:19.203
know what you're worth.

37:19.270 --> 37:21.639
Yeah, I feel you. I'm kind of
a quiet person too, like...

37:21.706 --> 37:23.040
depending on circumstances.

37:23.107 --> 37:27.778
I feel like we had a really
good like banter going on.

37:27.845 --> 37:32.016
And I feel like I'm getting
to know more about him.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.985
It's been pretty easy for
the most part to know

37:34.051 --> 37:35.920
who I don't vibe with and
who I do vibe with.

37:35.987 --> 37:38.189
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:38.255 --> 37:41.225
Are you usually really
good at like telling...

37:41.292 --> 37:42.360
right away?

37:42.460 --> 37:44.195
I definitely know if I would
have chemistry someone-

37:44.262 --> 37:45.596
with someone right away.

37:45.663 --> 37:46.597
I like it.

37:46.664 --> 37:48.232
It's exciting to find
someone that's like...

37:48.299 --> 37:52.103
refreshing and authentic here.

37:52.169 --> 37:54.305
Everyone has
personality archetypes.

37:54.372 --> 37:59.644
Like really like energetic like
loud people really tire me out.

37:59.710 --> 38:02.913
Hey, Josh...
Can I steal you?

38:02.980 --> 38:05.016
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Hey, girlfriend.

38:05.082 --> 38:06.117
- Go for it.
- Okay, I'm gonna...

38:06.183 --> 38:07.652
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.

38:07.718 --> 38:08.519
It was nice talking to you.

38:08.619 --> 38:10.821
Yeah, it was really nice
talking to you.

38:10.888 --> 38:12.790
- How are you, stud?
- I'm good.

38:12.857 --> 38:14.692
- How are you, Iva?
- Jealous.

38:14.759 --> 38:15.993
- Jealous?
- Yeah.

38:16.060 --> 38:18.763
- What?
- You flirting with other girls.

38:18.829 --> 38:19.797
How do you know
I'm flirting?

38:19.864 --> 38:22.700
I am looking.

38:22.767 --> 38:25.069
I've been waiting like dying
to talk to you again.

38:25.136 --> 38:28.105
Especially ́cause I was trying
so hard to talk to you after.

38:28.172 --> 38:30.875
I, I like you.
Like I actually like you.

38:30.941 --> 38:32.643
I don't like any other guys.

38:32.710 --> 38:34.779
Are you still into me after
our date and stuff?

38:34.845 --> 38:35.780
Um...

38:35.846 --> 38:37.782
Iva is coming in hot.

38:37.848 --> 38:39.850
She asked me the
hard questions.

38:39.917 --> 38:41.652
- You're like a lot of fun.
- Yeah.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.120
I guess like some of the
things there's like,

38:43.187 --> 38:45.956
you are like a ball of energy.

38:46.023 --> 38:47.625
How that like contrasts
with me is like

38:47.692 --> 38:49.360
I'm like a relatively
calm person.

38:49.427 --> 38:51.128
But so am I, to be honest,
normally.

38:51.195 --> 38:54.065
But if you bring me in and
I have tequila shots

38:54.131 --> 38:56.133
and then I go on a
first date with you...

38:56.200 --> 38:58.636
but obviously, I'm going to
be a little bit more,

38:58.703 --> 38:59.704
you know what I mean?

38:59.770 --> 39:00.838
Yeah, I totally get that.

39:00.905 --> 39:03.240
Iva, I...

39:03.307 --> 39:04.975
Iva.

39:05.042 --> 39:05.776
Can you tell me a
little bit like

39:05.843 --> 39:08.045
where you're at
with other girls?

39:08.112 --> 39:11.282
Coming off of last week,
Lisa and I had...

39:11.349 --> 39:12.750
yeah, we had something.

39:12.817 --> 39:15.052
And I also had some time
with Maria last night.

39:15.119 --> 39:18.723
Really just trying to take that
time to think about...

39:18.789 --> 39:20.124
I don't know, like what's
in my heart.

39:20.191 --> 39:22.026
That's really hard to
know right now.

39:22.093 --> 39:25.096
But it's definitely something
I'm figuring out.

39:25.162 --> 39:27.031
So, let's talk
about you and I.

39:27.098 --> 39:28.265
Okay.

39:28.332 --> 39:31.736
Where are you at with us?

39:31.802 --> 39:35.806
Yeah, well, I mean, we are
here- Like, we're here to...

39:35.873 --> 39:36.974
She's hammering me.

39:37.041 --> 39:38.309
I mean, like, she's not
really giving me

39:38.376 --> 39:40.244
an opportunity to float
around subjects.

39:40.311 --> 39:41.912
She wants the answers.

39:41.979 --> 39:43.180
We had our date.

39:43.247 --> 39:44.448
I feel like I've gotten
to know you.

39:44.515 --> 39:48.152
I don't want you to feel like
you need to spend this day...

39:48.219 --> 39:49.420
pursuing me.

39:49.487 --> 39:51.122
Well, I'm just feeling like
this is honestly

39:51.188 --> 39:53.224
the only connection I
have had so far.

39:53.290 --> 39:55.159
But like, tonight's the rose
ceremony, right,

39:55.226 --> 39:57.228
so I'm nervous. Like I
might be going home.

39:57.294 --> 39:59.063
I definitely cannot sit here
and guarantee you that

39:59.130 --> 40:00.398
I'm gonna give
you my rose.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.800
At this point, I cannot just
lie to somebody.

40:02.867 --> 40:04.969
If you want to just straight
up ask me that,

40:05.035 --> 40:07.071
no, it's not gonna happen.

40:07.138 --> 40:08.806
Should I like pursue
other things?

40:08.873 --> 40:11.075
́Cause if so,
please tell me.

40:11.142 --> 40:13.077
I think that you should
pursue other things.

40:13.144 --> 40:14.278
- Yeah?
- Mhm.

40:14.345 --> 40:15.413
Oh, that sucks.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.248
It's just not where I'm at
in this moment right now.

40:17.314 --> 40:18.883
- No, that's fair.
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:18.949 --> 40:20.451
This has been like really
tough, to be honest.

40:20.518 --> 40:22.887
At this point I'm pretty
clear that things with Josh

40:22.953 --> 40:25.222
are not going anywhere so,
I want to see if there's

40:25.289 --> 40:26.924
something with another guy
that's kind of

40:26.991 --> 40:28.192
on the fence with
another girl.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.427
- Okay, well cheers.
- Cheers.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.928
Good luck to you and...

40:30.995 --> 40:32.696
- Thank you.
- Whoever.

40:36.066 --> 40:37.134
<i>Coming up...</i>

40:37.201 --> 40:40.171
Josh has a super difficult
decision to make tonight.

40:40.237 --> 40:41.372
Do whatever you...

40:41.438 --> 40:42.807
like, you want.

40:42.873 --> 40:43.908
I definitely like you.

40:43.974 --> 40:45.876
Don't entertain
me for nothing.

40:45.943 --> 40:47.711
I feel like I genuinely
know you.

40:47.778 --> 40:51.182
I don't know where I'm at.
I'm confused about Lisa.

40:51.248 --> 40:52.483
I definitely have
feelings for her.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.919
I'm really not
sure what to do.

40:54.985 --> 40:56.287
I don't know, what am I
supposed to do, man?

40:56.353 --> 40:58.022
You seem to have
your priorities

40:58.088 --> 40:59.290
a little mixed up right now.

40:59.356 --> 41:01.792
Don't keep mentioning
the same girl.

41:01.859 --> 41:03.027
It makes me feel like shit.

41:13.637 --> 41:14.705
- Hi.
- Hi.

41:14.772 --> 41:16.874
- How are you?
- I'm good.

41:16.941 --> 41:19.176
Well, you were the first one to
welcome me into Paradise,

41:19.243 --> 41:20.578
which was really nice.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.813
It's, I feel like I'm a
welcoming guy.

41:22.880 --> 41:25.115
I'm open to exploring a new
connection with Mike

41:25.182 --> 41:27.685
who is in a relationship,
but is still kind of

41:27.751 --> 41:29.019
open to new connections.

41:29.086 --> 41:30.788
So, I want to see
where that gets me.

41:30.855 --> 41:33.023
I'm trying to find that
someone for me.

41:33.090 --> 41:34.992
- I haven't been able to yet.
- Okay.

41:35.059 --> 41:38.062
So, if you are open to it,
I would like us to

41:38.128 --> 41:39.897
get to know each other
a little bit better.

41:39.964 --> 41:43.067
Mhm.

41:43.133 --> 41:45.870
Why, why did you come
to Paradise?

41:45.936 --> 41:48.806
I was stuck on the same guy
for the past 3 years.

41:48.873 --> 41:51.742
And this could be my
fresh start. Like,

41:51.809 --> 41:53.344
you're gonna put this behind
you and you're gonna meet

41:53.410 --> 41:54.845
someone and you're gonna
fall in love here and

41:54.912 --> 41:55.913
it's gonna be great.

41:55.980 --> 41:57.114
- Okay.
- Yeah.

41:57.181 --> 42:00.017
But I, I feel it was
getting emotional.

42:00.084 --> 42:02.253
I'm always emotional because
of 3 years of your life

42:02.319 --> 42:04.121
in your 20s is a long time.

42:04.188 --> 42:07.625
Do you think that after coming
out of something like that,

42:07.691 --> 42:08.959
that you're ready for
something,

42:09.026 --> 42:10.961
to jump into something
more serious?

42:11.028 --> 42:14.064
No, but trust me, like I have
been craving something stable

42:14.131 --> 42:16.066
and something normal
and healthy.

42:16.133 --> 42:17.134
What about you?

42:17.201 --> 42:18.369
I was on a previous season.

42:18.435 --> 42:20.871
I was on
The Bachelorette Canada.

42:20.938 --> 42:22.773
It didn't, didn't end up
working out,

42:22.840 --> 42:25.809
but I gave it my shot.
I worked on myself a lot.

42:25.876 --> 42:28.345
I'm now open to

42:28.412 --> 42:31.815
dating all sorts of people
and trying new things.

42:31.882 --> 42:32.816
Seeing what I really like.

42:32.883 --> 42:35.786
So, were you interested in me
when I came in?

42:35.853 --> 42:37.888
I, I loved your energy.

42:37.955 --> 42:41.025
And I definitely did
notice some...

42:41.091 --> 42:43.193
some very, very cool
things about you.

42:43.260 --> 42:45.663
I feel super comfortable
around Mike.

42:45.729 --> 42:47.031
He's a chill dude.

42:47.097 --> 42:48.399
What do you see
in your future?

42:48.465 --> 42:50.334
I haven't had a partner
in a minute.

42:50.401 --> 42:53.037
And I, I struggle with
establishing connections.

42:53.103 --> 42:55.940
Like, I think some people
find me too intense or

42:56.006 --> 42:57.708
just maybe a
little bit blunt.

42:57.775 --> 42:59.877
Or I'm not sure, but I'm
missing something.

42:59.944 --> 43:02.880
Ideally, I want a nice life.
I want a couple of kids.

43:02.947 --> 43:05.349
And I want a nice big house
and a nice big yard.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.550
So, that's kind
of what I want.

43:06.617 --> 43:09.787
What I like about Mike is he's
definitely a genuine guy.

43:09.853 --> 43:12.423
And I feel like he's open to me
and he's listening to me,

43:12.489 --> 43:14.391
and he is appreciating what
we're talking about.

43:14.458 --> 43:16.827
I feel like we're having
like a true moment.

43:16.894 --> 43:20.064
If I'm gone, then we can never
have that opportunity again.

43:20.130 --> 43:22.800
Is there a way for me
to convince you that

43:22.866 --> 43:26.136
you should like explore this,
like, with me?

43:26.203 --> 43:29.239
I think you're really cool.
I'll be straight up with you.

43:29.306 --> 43:31.709
It's honestly, it's not an
answer I can...

43:31.775 --> 43:33.811
just give you right now.

43:33.877 --> 43:36.380
I want, like I want, I want
to spend my time being

43:36.447 --> 43:38.749
by the water and connecting
with a handsome man.

43:39.883 --> 43:41.785
Okay, but, no, no, no,
but listen.

43:41.852 --> 43:44.254
I'm telling you, I think you
are smoking hot.

43:44.321 --> 43:45.756
Thank you.

43:45.823 --> 43:49.827
I could sense a desperation
in Iva's voice.

43:49.893 --> 43:51.195
Like, so you know that
it's physical too.

43:51.261 --> 43:52.963
Like I'm not just saying
that you're deep and

43:53.030 --> 43:54.465
we're having deep
conversations.

43:54.531 --> 43:55.599
Body language...

43:55.699 --> 43:59.803
Like I am interested in
pursuing this past this point.

43:59.870 --> 44:01.372
Wanting to stay in Paradise.

44:01.438 --> 44:03.474
You can only give us that.
I can't give us that.

44:03.540 --> 44:06.477
Well...

44:06.543 --> 44:10.147
She's a very
aggressive person.

44:10.214 --> 44:12.983
Are we gonna kiss
to see if we vibe?

44:13.050 --> 44:15.052
You have to respect the
way that I have to...

44:15.119 --> 44:17.788
- Yeah.
- Have to deal with this.

44:17.855 --> 44:19.923
You have to understand that
I've been here a while.

44:19.990 --> 44:21.825
We should just, I think
we'll leave it, like,

44:21.892 --> 44:23.260
you're super cool.

44:23.327 --> 44:24.795
And I really appreciate
you opening up.

44:24.862 --> 44:26.797
Yeah, man, of course, that's
what we're here to do.

44:26.864 --> 44:30.167
Whether she legitimately wanted
to get to know me or she

44:30.234 --> 44:33.771
wanted to buy some time,
I can't fault her for that.

44:33.837 --> 44:36.040
But at the same time, ah...

44:40.144 --> 44:43.414
I felt- [Laughing I just
don't want to like...

44:43.480 --> 44:44.581
rip her a new one here.

44:44.648 --> 44:48.285
If you like me tonight and
you decide that I'm the girl

44:48.352 --> 44:50.954
to go rather than the
girl you're with...

44:51.021 --> 44:53.257
Just pull me aside and give
me a kiss and I'll be like,

44:53.323 --> 44:54.525
'kay, we're good to go.

44:54.591 --> 44:58.896
Yeah, I just, ah, there's just
so much in my brain right now.

45:10.140 --> 45:11.075
Hi, bro, what up?

45:11.141 --> 45:13.277
I've been trying for the
last couple days to just

45:13.343 --> 45:15.379
have some alone
time with Lisa.

45:15.446 --> 45:16.880
Let's go have a chat.

45:16.947 --> 45:19.817
I'm confused about Lisa.
I really care for her.

45:19.883 --> 45:21.552
I definitely have
feelings for her.

45:21.618 --> 45:24.822
I just don't know what kind
of feelings those are.

45:24.888 --> 45:27.124
I want to talk about like
where we're at.

45:27.191 --> 45:30.961
In all transparency, what are
we doing here, like you and I?

45:31.028 --> 45:32.396
'Cause I know that we
get along really well,

45:32.463 --> 45:34.965
but that doesn't
mean that like...

45:35.032 --> 45:38.001
we're guaranteed to be
like a great match.

45:38.068 --> 45:42.539
There's a level of connection,
but there's no fire.

45:42.606 --> 45:44.408
I definitely like you
and right now

45:44.475 --> 45:46.243
I can say I only have
eyes for you.

45:46.310 --> 45:49.012
I feel like I genuinely know
you and I know a lot about you.

45:49.079 --> 45:50.948
Yeah, you too, which has
been really dope.

45:51.014 --> 45:52.049
It's been really cool
getting to know you.

45:52.116 --> 45:54.384
But I feel like me and you need
more time together,

45:54.451 --> 45:58.555
to be honest. I want to shoot
my shot and see where it goes.

45:58.622 --> 46:01.125
- Let me ask you something.
- Yeah.

46:01.191 --> 46:03.494
Was there any new girl that
came in that you felt

46:03.560 --> 46:07.297
you vibed with at all?

46:07.364 --> 46:10.267
Ah, nobody but Maria.

46:10.334 --> 46:13.203
Right now, I'm between a
rock and Colombian place.

46:13.270 --> 46:15.873
You were like open to getting
to know her kind of thing?

46:15.939 --> 46:18.242
Yeah, exactly, let me
put it this way.

46:18.308 --> 46:19.877
No matter where this goes,

46:19.943 --> 46:21.612
I've really enjoyed like
hanging out with you.

46:21.678 --> 46:25.282
I honestly think that at
this point with how things

46:25.349 --> 46:27.317
have gone with me and Lisa,
I feel like I do have

46:27.384 --> 46:28.952
the freedom to choose Maria.

46:29.019 --> 46:30.988
We'll see where it goes.

46:44.301 --> 46:46.904
- Hey!
- There's my man! Woo!

46:46.970 --> 46:48.338
What's up, everyone?
How you feeling?

46:48.405 --> 46:50.107
- Great!
- Feeling great!

46:50.174 --> 46:52.976
Good, good, well at this point,
it's pretty clear there's

46:53.043 --> 46:56.346
some really strong relationships
being built so far.

46:56.413 --> 46:59.883
Tonight, you're gonna
see if that's real.

46:59.950 --> 47:02.486
Now on the flip side,
if you came into Paradise

47:02.553 --> 47:04.388
a little bit later,
you might be finding it

47:04.454 --> 47:07.257
hard to cut through
those relationships and

47:07.324 --> 47:09.893
establish some
connections of your own.

47:09.960 --> 47:13.530
For our ladies who haven't
been able to find that bond,

47:13.597 --> 47:16.300
tonight you have one last
chance at the cocktail party

47:16.366 --> 47:18.569
to make some sparks fly
with our gentlemen.

47:18.635 --> 47:21.538
And, hopefully, make some
sort of a connection

47:21.605 --> 47:25.142
before the rose ceremony.
So, lead with your heart.

47:25.209 --> 47:27.110
The next time we
see each other

47:27.177 --> 47:29.179
will be over at the
rose ceremony.

47:29.246 --> 47:31.248
Enjoy the cocktail party,
everybody.

47:31.315 --> 47:33.650
- Thank you.
-

47:33.717 --> 47:35.452
Cocktail party's gonna
be so stressful.

47:35.519 --> 47:37.221
And all eyes are
gonna be on me.

47:37.287 --> 47:40.090
I saw the stress on Lisa's
face last rose ceremony and

47:40.157 --> 47:42.059
I hope I don't have to feel
that way tonight.

47:42.125 --> 47:43.627
I think that every
other rose is

47:43.694 --> 47:45.996
pretty predictable
except for mine.

47:46.063 --> 47:47.965
- Hey, Josh.
- How you doing, Iva?

47:48.031 --> 47:49.933
Still hoping for that
rose from you.

47:51.168 --> 47:53.337
He told me he's
not giving me a rose.

47:53.403 --> 47:57.107
I was like, "That's fine".

47:57.174 --> 47:59.042
Ladies, how about you two?

47:59.109 --> 48:00.577
I feel good, I mean,
I feel content.

48:00.644 --> 48:03.013
Like, I'm grateful for my
experience here so,

48:03.080 --> 48:04.648
no matter what happens,
I feel good.

48:04.715 --> 48:08.051
You know, I'm not gonna wish
for anything else to happen.

48:08.118 --> 48:09.686
Like, I'm here, I came,
I experienced it.

48:09.753 --> 48:10.687
It is what it is.

48:10.754 --> 48:12.322
I came, I saw, I conquered.

48:12.389 --> 48:14.391
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

48:14.458 --> 48:16.660
Yeah, so, it is what it is.

48:16.727 --> 48:20.464
I don't think I am going to
get a rose and I knew,

48:20.530 --> 48:22.299
why waste my time?

48:22.366 --> 48:24.668
Okay, guys, so I have like an
announcement to make,

48:24.735 --> 48:27.037
if everyone could gather around.

48:27.104 --> 48:28.972
I had fun, I met amazing people.

48:29.039 --> 48:32.676
However, the men just
were not on my level.

48:32.743 --> 48:35.612
So, I've been here for
a few days,

48:35.679 --> 48:38.649
and this has been a very
interesting experience for me.

48:38.715 --> 48:42.019
I feel like I've learned a
lot about myself and

48:42.085 --> 48:44.388
I'm like super grateful
for this experience.

48:44.454 --> 48:47.591
And I'm just like happy to have
been here and met everyone,

48:47.658 --> 48:49.660
well, most of you, at least.

48:51.361 --> 48:54.698
But you know, my ship has
sailed, my time here has come.

48:54.765 --> 48:56.533
And I'm definitely over it.

48:58.168 --> 49:00.470
I'm leaving, I'm done.

49:00.537 --> 49:02.639
Hopefully we'll see
each other soon.

49:02.706 --> 49:04.274
If not, it's okay.

49:05.742 --> 49:08.378
I'm leaving on my own merit
and there are so many

49:08.445 --> 49:12.516
men in this world who are
waiting for my time.

49:12.582 --> 49:13.450
Spilled.

49:13.517 --> 49:16.086
Okay, one last affirmation,
just 'cause.

49:16.153 --> 49:19.456
I know everyone here eventually
whether they find it here or

49:19.523 --> 49:22.459
in the future is going to
have love, happiness,

49:22.526 --> 49:23.393
whether they
deserve it or not

49:23.460 --> 49:25.629
we're all going to be
very happy people.

49:25.696 --> 49:28.432
And to wealth,
luxury, glamour.

49:28.498 --> 49:30.801
And we're gonna have
wonderful lives, so...

49:30.867 --> 49:33.337
I'm done, I'm done.

49:33.403 --> 49:34.438
-
- Sasa!

49:34.504 --> 49:35.772
Woo!

49:35.839 --> 49:37.674
I will never give up on love.

49:37.741 --> 49:39.643
I know my true love is coming.

49:39.710 --> 49:42.512
When I was younger, I visited
a psychic and she told me that

49:42.579 --> 49:44.181
I was gonna have 3
divorces so that means

49:44.247 --> 49:48.485
I'm gonna have 3 husbands.
Like, love is coming my way.

49:48.552 --> 49:51.355
- Goodbye.
-

49:51.421 --> 49:53.657
Cheers to that.

49:59.296 --> 50:00.464
<i>Coming up...</i>

50:00.530 --> 50:01.531
Are they looking for
a friendship or

50:01.598 --> 50:02.532
are they looking for love?

50:02.599 --> 50:05.502
As much as I love Lisa,
I wouldn't be surprised

50:05.569 --> 50:07.671
if he swayed a
different direction.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.339
It's hard because you
have different reasons

50:09.406 --> 50:10.707
for choosing
different people.

50:10.774 --> 50:13.477
No, I wanna go home.

50:13.543 --> 50:14.811
Maria...

50:14.878 --> 50:17.781
What other direction is
this going other than

50:17.848 --> 50:20.083
you care about that girl?

50:20.150 --> 50:22.853
If I am wrong, put me in
my place right now.

50:22.919 --> 50:24.688
This is ridiculous.

50:32.896 --> 50:34.698
Hey, Maria.

50:34.765 --> 50:36.032
You mentioned you
wanted to chat.

50:36.099 --> 50:37.034
I was gonna see if you
want to talk?

50:37.100 --> 50:40.971
- Sure, let's go.
- Alright.

50:41.038 --> 50:44.708
I've hung out with Maria for
probably about an hour

50:44.775 --> 50:46.710
coming into this
rose ceremony.

50:46.777 --> 50:49.079
And, I just need to take
every moment that

50:49.146 --> 50:52.115
I have to get to
know Maria more.

50:52.182 --> 50:54.084
It's been very hard.

50:54.151 --> 50:57.421
Yeah, I know.

50:57.487 --> 50:59.589
- You okay?
- No.

50:59.656 --> 51:00.924
How come?

51:00.991 --> 51:06.530
I'm upset that I wasted
my date card...

51:06.596 --> 51:10.133
on something that wasn't
even like a possibility.

51:10.200 --> 51:12.035
Having this conversation
with you, like I want to,

51:12.102 --> 51:13.403
but it's like,
at the same time

51:13.470 --> 51:14.638
I already know
what you're doing.

51:14.704 --> 51:16.173
How do you know?
We haven't even sat down.

51:16.239 --> 51:18.442
The last thing I would want to
do is try and toy with you.

51:18.508 --> 51:20.444
For real. Listen, like,
obviously I've really

51:20.510 --> 51:21.278
enjoyed getting
to know you.

51:21.344 --> 51:23.513
Well, we-
like, I know, me too.

51:23.580 --> 51:24.614
It's like it's in your hands.

51:24.681 --> 51:28.652
Like we could, so like, it's,
it's on you, like...

51:28.718 --> 51:30.921
Do whatever like, you want.

51:30.987 --> 51:32.856
But don't entertain me
for nothing 'cause

51:32.923 --> 51:34.658
I've already gone
through that once.

51:34.724 --> 51:36.460
And I don't want
to do that again.

51:36.526 --> 51:37.527
I really don't want you
to feel that way.

51:37.594 --> 51:39.729
You're easily one of the
most beautiful girls here.

51:39.796 --> 51:41.498
You have an amazing
personality.

51:41.565 --> 51:44.101
And this, this is really hard.

51:44.167 --> 51:46.870
But like you really have to
think about like,

51:46.937 --> 51:50.740
we still have like,
more time.

51:50.807 --> 51:53.009
So, like if you want to get to
know me, like, that's on you.

51:53.076 --> 51:54.211
If you don't, then like,
it's fine.

51:54.277 --> 51:56.079
I do, obviously, I do.

51:58.982 --> 52:00.117
Do we think he's still
picking Lisa?

52:00.183 --> 52:03.887
Josh has a super difficult
decision to make tonight and,

52:03.954 --> 52:06.123
I don't think anyone is
going to know exactly

52:06.189 --> 52:08.825
where his head's at until
he hands out that rose.

52:08.892 --> 52:10.193
They've both been super
honest with each other about

52:10.260 --> 52:12.562
the fact that it's not
necessarily like super romantic.

52:12.629 --> 52:15.799
But they're both like not,
like, crossing that off.

52:15.866 --> 52:17.467
But are they looking
for a friendship or

52:17.534 --> 52:18.602
are they looking for love?

52:18.668 --> 52:20.070
Josh genuinely loves
her humour and

52:20.137 --> 52:21.771
loves spending
time with her.

52:21.838 --> 52:23.807
Josh does like her more
than Lisa likes him.

52:23.874 --> 52:25.542
Obviously, I love Lisa
so much and

52:25.609 --> 52:27.577
I love what they have
like made together.

52:27.644 --> 52:29.713
But I also want him
to be happy too.

52:29.779 --> 52:32.949
And I feel like he should have
the opportunity for romance.

52:33.016 --> 52:35.685
I feel like they owe it to
themselves to like really like

52:35.752 --> 52:37.554
take this experience into like

52:37.621 --> 52:39.055
what it's actually
supposed to be for.

52:39.122 --> 52:41.825
As much as I love Lisa and I
don't want her to go home,

52:41.892 --> 52:44.694
I just know she's
just not there yet.

52:44.761 --> 52:50.066
I wouldn't be surprised if he's
trying to see if he should sway

52:50.133 --> 52:52.736
a different direction because
of how slowly him and

52:52.802 --> 52:54.771
Lisa's relationship
is progressing.

52:54.838 --> 52:58.108
I just want both of them
to be happy.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.977
Like, for me it's like, if you
want to get to know me,

53:01.044 --> 53:02.646
like I'm here.

53:02.712 --> 53:05.582
And I'm like willing and I'm
open and I'm being authentic.

53:05.649 --> 53:07.284
And like, love to get
to know you.

53:07.350 --> 53:09.286
But like, if you're not...

53:09.352 --> 53:10.787
down for it, then like...

53:10.854 --> 53:13.023
- Of course, I'm down for it.
- It's, it's...

53:13.089 --> 53:14.190
Agh!

53:14.257 --> 53:15.325
I'm putting
myself out there.

53:15.392 --> 53:18.061
Like I really do want to get to
know people and like,

53:18.128 --> 53:21.298
this is the chance.
That's it.

53:21.364 --> 53:25.869
- Yeah, I respect that.
- Okay.

53:25.936 --> 53:27.270
Sorry that ended up like this.

53:27.337 --> 53:28.972
This is like a nightmare time
to come here.

53:29.039 --> 53:31.608
- It's awful!
- I know.

53:31.675 --> 53:32.776
Hey...

53:32.842 --> 53:36.112
- No, I want to go home.
- Okay.

53:36.179 --> 53:38.615
No... I really
want to go home.

53:38.682 --> 53:41.618
This is so dumb.

53:41.685 --> 53:44.688
That was a really tough
conversation and...

53:44.754 --> 53:48.124
I, she didn't really give me
a lot of room to say a lot.

53:49.292 --> 53:52.829
I feel like I'm still kind of
lost in this and...

53:52.896 --> 53:56.266
now, I just feel like I'm
in a mix of like...

53:56.333 --> 53:59.202
emotions and not really
knowing where I'm at.

54:03.406 --> 54:04.841
[Beep]!

54:10.213 --> 54:11.147
At this point,
I'm just like

54:11.214 --> 54:13.216
not feeling
anything anymore.

54:13.283 --> 54:14.651
I'm just not.

54:18.755 --> 54:21.324
I feel hurt with like the
entire experience, like...

54:25.061 --> 54:27.564
It's like too much for me.

54:37.507 --> 54:38.942
I just want to go home.

54:46.549 --> 54:50.420
- Maria...
- That was awful.

54:50.487 --> 54:52.355
I just want to go home.

54:52.422 --> 54:53.923
I feel like you shouldn't
come in here ́cause

54:53.990 --> 54:55.625
you're just gonna
make me cry more.

54:55.692 --> 54:57.661
Oh, that's fine, you can
cry in front of me.

54:57.727 --> 55:00.864
If you can cry in front
of anyone, it's me.

55:00.930 --> 55:03.099
This is not good.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.801
What's the matter?
Talk to me.

55:04.868 --> 55:07.537
Like, I can't, I don't want to
do this anymore.

55:07.604 --> 55:09.873
No, I just don't feel like
people are authentic at all.

55:09.939 --> 55:13.376
And I can't put my
heart out on like...

55:13.443 --> 55:16.346
and then just like...

55:16.413 --> 55:21.017
Maria is having a meltdown.
She is not doing well right now.

55:21.084 --> 55:22.986
Not seeing the rest of
the night through,

55:23.053 --> 55:25.755
then you're just giving in
to what you're believing

55:25.822 --> 55:26.856
these people are doing.

55:26.923 --> 55:29.893
I don't know if she's staying
for this rose ceremony

55:29.959 --> 55:31.561
or if she's leaving.

55:31.628 --> 55:33.396
What's the worst that
happens if you stay?

55:33.463 --> 55:36.499
I don't care about the
rejection. It's just like, it'--

55:36.566 --> 55:39.536
I don't even understand why
people like entertain it.

55:39.602 --> 55:41.404
No one's even willing to like
get to know you.

55:41.471 --> 55:42.939
And they're like,
"Oh, you're so cool,

55:43.006 --> 55:45.475
I like you so much,
but like...

55:45.542 --> 55:47.544
I'm already kind of hanging
out with this girl that I met

55:47.610 --> 55:49.646
two days ago." So,
what's the point?

55:49.713 --> 55:50.880
Well, it's tough,
and I'm telling you

55:50.947 --> 55:52.515
things happen
very quickly here.

55:52.582 --> 55:56.052
It feels like she's kind of
convincing herself that

55:56.119 --> 55:58.888
everyone is out to get her
and no one's being genuine,

55:58.955 --> 56:01.491
which is not the case at all.

56:01.558 --> 56:03.827
I don't feel like
looking like a fool.

56:03.893 --> 56:05.762
Like I don't feel like
entertaining people that

56:05.829 --> 56:07.464
aren't even willing
to talk to me.

56:11.568 --> 56:13.136
Like, it's taking away
from my time with him.

56:13.203 --> 56:15.071
Like, I want to spend
time with him.

56:15.138 --> 56:16.940
Yes, I'm a little jealous...

56:17.006 --> 56:19.809
of the fact that he's spending
time with her because I know

56:19.876 --> 56:22.645
Joey and Maria have a history,
but I don't think the focus

56:22.712 --> 56:24.581
should be on Maria
and her feelings.

56:24.647 --> 56:27.717
I think maybe it should be on
his girlfriend and her feelings.

56:28.785 --> 56:31.087
I think it's just...

56:34.124 --> 56:35.759
Don't worry, like,
if anything-

56:35.825 --> 56:37.560
I don't know what the, what
the headspace is there.

56:43.533 --> 56:44.434
It sucks.

56:44.501 --> 56:45.535
Like, I understand that
you're upset about,

56:45.602 --> 56:47.470
you know, feeling like your
time has been wasted.

56:47.537 --> 56:48.705
It does suck.

56:48.772 --> 56:50.707
But now we gotta deal with the
things that are in front of us.

56:50.774 --> 56:52.075
And we gotta make
the best of ́em.

56:52.142 --> 56:55.712
I like wanted this to be like
a positive experience.

56:55.779 --> 56:57.714
And like, it just sucked.

56:57.781 --> 56:59.482
It was awful.

56:59.549 --> 57:01.050
At the end of the day,
I think you should do

57:01.117 --> 57:03.119
what's best for you.
I do, and I...

57:03.186 --> 57:05.488
I think you deserve all the
happiness in the world.

57:05.555 --> 57:10.627
And I think that that could
happen here if you...

57:10.693 --> 57:12.228
open yourself to
allow it to happen.

57:12.295 --> 57:14.831
Like I literally just had
the conversation with the-

57:14.898 --> 57:16.466
with Josh, who is like the,

57:16.533 --> 57:18.468
the last person that
I got to know.

57:18.535 --> 57:19.869
Like the only person that
was actually willing

57:19.936 --> 57:21.471
to like talk to me.

57:21.538 --> 57:22.672
Did he tell you
what he's doing?

57:22.739 --> 57:25.241
No, Lisa did.

57:25.308 --> 57:27.610
Is it Lisa's rose to give?

57:27.677 --> 57:28.578
At the end of the day,

57:28.645 --> 57:30.513
it's Josh's decision of
what he's gonna do.

57:30.580 --> 57:31.748
It's not Lisa's decision.

57:31.815 --> 57:35.518
I just want her to try to enjoy
this moment for what it is and

57:35.585 --> 57:37.854
not get caught up in
all the bullshit.

57:37.921 --> 57:40.156
It seems like maybe Josh could
be open because...

57:40.223 --> 57:42.826
it's hard to see a really
strong connection

57:42.892 --> 57:44.027
between him and Lisa.

57:44.093 --> 57:45.929
Yeah, but I'm not like
begging for a rose.

57:45.995 --> 57:49.032
I, no one said you had to.
Things change real quick here.

57:49.098 --> 57:51.234
Don't worry about the rose.
If it happens, it happens.

57:51.301 --> 57:53.236
If it doesn't... whatever.

57:53.303 --> 57:55.872
You got to come here and like
I said, worst case scenario,

57:55.939 --> 57:57.173
you get to hang out with me.

57:57.240 --> 57:58.241
That's true.

57:58.308 --> 58:01.244
I can think of a much worse
worst-case scenario.

58:01.311 --> 58:03.746
That's the best
I could have.

58:03.813 --> 58:05.081
- There you go.
- Thanks, Joey.

58:05.148 --> 58:06.282
You're very welcome.

58:06.349 --> 58:07.817
Thank you for coming
to talk to me.

58:07.884 --> 58:09.552
- That was very nice.
- Of course.

58:09.619 --> 58:12.121
Okay, be well.

58:12.188 --> 58:13.723
You look really good still,
by the way.

58:13.790 --> 58:14.657
I look awful.

58:14.724 --> 58:16.059
Come get a drink with me
when you're ready.

58:16.125 --> 58:17.527
- Alright?
- Yeah.

58:17.594 --> 58:18.928
Okay.

58:22.165 --> 58:23.233
What's shaking?

58:23.299 --> 58:24.133
I don't know, everybody's
asks you for advice, man,

58:24.200 --> 58:27.036
so I figured I, I'd bring
you into this.

58:27.103 --> 58:28.972
I thought I knew and then
I thought I didn't know.

58:29.038 --> 58:29.973
And then I thought
I knew again.

58:30.039 --> 58:33.042
And then I thought
something else. And now...

58:33.109 --> 58:35.612
honestly, no matter
what I do tonight,

58:35.678 --> 58:39.048
a lot of people are
gonna get hurt.

58:39.115 --> 58:41.117
I don't know like

58:41.184 --> 58:44.687
where down the line this
happened, but like...

58:44.754 --> 58:47.891
Maria felt like she was,
she's convinced that

58:47.957 --> 58:49.692
I'm gonna choose Lisa.

58:49.759 --> 58:52.695
And when I took her aside, man,
she just like- before we could

58:52.762 --> 58:55.198
even sit down, she just started
crying and like-

58:55.265 --> 58:57.233
- Maria did?
- Yeah, she was like angry.

58:57.300 --> 58:58.902
She's like...

58:58.968 --> 58:59.903
She was crying
almost immediately

58:59.969 --> 59:00.970
when she spoke with you?

59:01.037 --> 59:03.339
- Oh, man.
- What was that about?

59:03.406 --> 59:05.341
I don't blame it.
I think between, you know,

59:05.408 --> 59:06.476
the date that she had
with Brendan M.,

59:06.543 --> 59:10.947
she just feels like she's
been toyed with, I guess.

59:11.014 --> 59:13.850
Watching her go through
that was really tough.

59:13.917 --> 59:15.852
It's hard, like, it's hard
to process all of it.

59:15.919 --> 59:17.954
And like, I thought-

59:18.021 --> 59:20.223
I don't think she realizes
that like I can't...

59:20.290 --> 59:23.126
I don't, I don't really
know where I'm at.

59:23.192 --> 59:27.196
What, in all of this, what is
your heart telling you?

59:27.263 --> 59:29.832
It's hard because like you
have different reasons

59:29.899 --> 59:31.701
for choosing
different people.

59:31.768 --> 59:34.070
And, I guess I'm just
trying to root out...

59:34.137 --> 59:36.806
reasons of like fear or...

59:36.873 --> 59:39.642
concern and just focus
on following my heart.

59:39.709 --> 59:42.712
I can't, I can't tell you how
to go about doing this.

59:42.779 --> 59:44.847
That's a Josh thing, but...

59:44.914 --> 59:49.152
I would say, take the time you
need before this rose ceremony

59:49.218 --> 59:53.823
and really turn your eyes
inward and see what you want.

59:53.890 --> 59:57.093
And see what makes you happy.

59:57.160 --> 59:58.895
Appreciate you, man.

1:00:01.197 --> 1:00:03.166
- You're my buddy.
- Man hug.

1:00:03.232 --> 1:00:06.002
Yeah, man hug,
you're a good man, Josh.

1:00:06.069 --> 1:00:09.872
Just number one,
be happy, man.

1:00:09.939 --> 1:00:12.141
I could give Maria that chance.

1:00:12.208 --> 1:00:15.244
And, it could turn out to be
something incredible.

1:00:15.311 --> 1:00:18.881
Or, I could stick to my
guns with Lisa and

1:00:18.948 --> 1:00:20.917
keep working on
what we have.

1:00:22.785 --> 1:00:24.654
I'm really not
sure what to do.

1:00:35.932 --> 1:00:38.701
Sorry, Joey, I stole
your place.

1:00:38.768 --> 1:00:39.502
Do you want to switch?

1:00:39.569 --> 1:00:41.471
No, you can stay there,
it's fine.

1:00:41.537 --> 1:00:42.672
I'm a little annoyed.

1:00:42.739 --> 1:00:45.842
He's definitely prioritizing
Maria's feelings over mine.

1:00:45.908 --> 1:00:47.744
Because she's upset.

1:00:47.810 --> 1:00:49.579
But I don't think he
understands that

1:00:49.646 --> 1:00:52.048
it's upsetting me as well.

1:00:52.115 --> 1:00:55.518
No, I'm catching
shit from Vay.

1:00:55.585 --> 1:00:58.488
Why?

1:00:58.554 --> 1:01:00.723
I'm having conversations
with both Vay and Joey.

1:01:00.790 --> 1:01:05.061
And you could feel the
energy is a little strange.

1:01:05.128 --> 1:01:07.997
Let me just explain
why I'm upset.

1:01:08.064 --> 1:01:11.000
He talks about this girl a lot.
Too much.

1:01:11.067 --> 1:01:12.869
He talked about her
all day yesterday.

1:01:12.935 --> 1:01:14.937
How amazing she is,
how beautiful she is.

1:01:15.004 --> 1:01:16.172
He was pumping her up.

1:01:16.239 --> 1:01:19.509
I think Vay is justified in
feeling the way that she feels.

1:01:19.575 --> 1:01:21.844
Joey should have been a little
more conscious of that.

1:01:21.911 --> 1:01:23.880
I mean, he was in
a weird position.

1:01:23.946 --> 1:01:26.682
After a full day of hearing how
amazing she was, I'm like...

1:01:26.749 --> 1:01:28.551
just stop.

1:01:28.618 --> 1:01:29.786
What do you want me
to do, Vay?

1:01:29.852 --> 1:01:31.821
I'm sorry that I'm friends with
somebody that came in here.

1:01:31.888 --> 1:01:36.492
My man, Joey, yeah, he was
talking a lot about Maria.

1:01:36.559 --> 1:01:40.063
Like I didn't want any of this
to play out the way it did.

1:01:40.129 --> 1:01:40.997
I feel bad.

1:01:41.064 --> 1:01:42.265
And that's exactly
where I'm coming from.

1:01:42.331 --> 1:01:44.100
I feel bad for
the poor girl.

1:01:44.167 --> 1:01:46.536
I'm the only person
she knows here.

1:01:46.602 --> 1:01:49.706
Don't keep mentioning the
same girl over and over and

1:01:49.772 --> 1:01:51.507
over and over
and over again.

1:01:51.574 --> 1:01:53.543
It makes me feel like shit,
not gonna lie.

1:01:53.609 --> 1:01:56.813
I just want to know where
your priority- priority's at.

1:01:56.879 --> 1:01:58.081
Pick.

1:01:58.147 --> 1:02:01.584
I clearly don't give a
about Maria in a romantic way.

1:02:01.651 --> 1:02:03.019
Platonically, yes.

1:02:03.086 --> 1:02:04.687
I don't know, what am I
supposed to do, man?

1:02:04.754 --> 1:02:06.722
I think he can have both,
you know?

1:02:06.789 --> 1:02:08.291
But can he?
Because at this point,

1:02:08.357 --> 1:02:12.728
he has a girlfriend and all
I'm hearing is about a girl.

1:02:12.795 --> 1:02:14.797
His priority is 100% with you.

1:02:14.864 --> 1:02:18.701
I'm just trying to be there
for the people that I know.

1:02:18.768 --> 1:02:23.172
I understand that Joey and
I are in a relationship.

1:02:23.239 --> 1:02:24.774
But we don't always
have to agree and

1:02:24.841 --> 1:02:26.776
I don't agree on
this right now.

1:02:26.843 --> 1:02:28.711
Cluster

1:02:28.778 --> 1:02:31.180
Oh, man, yeah.

1:02:31.247 --> 1:02:33.282
If we didn't have the
conversation yesterday,

1:02:33.349 --> 1:02:34.717
maybe I would feel different.

1:02:34.784 --> 1:02:36.652
I just don't like
repeating myself.

1:02:36.719 --> 1:02:38.154
You seem to have
your priorities

1:02:38.221 --> 1:02:39.622
a little mixed up right now.

1:02:39.689 --> 1:02:43.893
- No, I don't.
- That's not how I see it.

1:02:43.960 --> 1:02:45.128
Well, it's how you
should be seeing it

1:02:45.194 --> 1:02:46.229
because that's how it is.

1:02:46.295 --> 1:02:48.698
Okay, fair enough.

1:02:48.764 --> 1:02:51.067
I don't care about Maria.
I care about her as a friend.

1:02:51.134 --> 1:02:52.902
- Yeah, you do.
- No, I don't.

1:02:52.969 --> 1:02:53.970
Yeah, you do.

1:02:54.036 --> 1:02:55.905
I mean, I'm trying to talk
to her and understand

1:02:55.972 --> 1:02:57.773
where she's coming from.
But at the same time,

1:02:57.840 --> 1:02:59.675
she's coming at me
pretty strong.

1:02:59.742 --> 1:03:01.944
I just...

1:03:02.011 --> 1:03:03.713
I don't even know what to say.

1:03:03.780 --> 1:03:07.316
Please tell me what other
direction this is going

1:03:07.383 --> 1:03:10.086
other than you care
about that girl?

1:03:10.153 --> 1:03:13.022
Vay has no reason to be
threatened by Maria.

1:03:13.089 --> 1:03:14.757
Even in the slightest.

1:03:14.824 --> 1:03:16.659
You wouldn't have came here
and sat and been like,

1:03:16.726 --> 1:03:18.861
Maria this, Maria that,
Maria this, Maria that.

1:03:18.928 --> 1:03:20.263
Because you care about Maria.

1:03:20.329 --> 1:03:22.598
- No!
- Like, like...

1:03:22.665 --> 1:03:27.336
Seriously, like, if I am wrong,
put me in my place right now.

1:03:27.403 --> 1:03:29.839
It's hard for me to justify
where I'm coming from

1:03:29.906 --> 1:03:32.375
at this point,
with how she's feeling.

1:03:32.441 --> 1:03:34.143
Go.

1:03:36.779 --> 1:03:39.949
Put your priorities in order.
That's all I'm trying to say.

1:03:40.016 --> 1:03:42.652
- They are in order.
- That's anyway...

1:03:42.718 --> 1:03:44.320
Okay, I'm not having this
conversation right now.

1:03:44.387 --> 1:03:46.122
I can't believe we're
actually having it either.

1:03:46.189 --> 1:03:48.658
Okay, then squash it then.

1:03:50.793 --> 1:03:52.361
Let's just stop
talking right now.

1:03:55.298 --> 1:03:57.133
I am so confused.

1:03:57.200 --> 1:03:58.768
Like, I can't be
here right now.

1:03:58.835 --> 1:04:03.072
I need to go to the washroom.
Do you wanna go, Kit?

1:04:03.139 --> 1:04:04.941
ridiculous.

1:04:07.443 --> 1:04:10.413
<i>Next time, on Bachelor in
Paradise Canada.</i>

1:04:10.479 --> 1:04:13.082
We're just less than a week
away from the final rose.

1:04:13.149 --> 1:04:13.950
There's certain
conversations that

1:04:14.016 --> 1:04:15.985
have to be talked
about around here.

1:04:16.052 --> 1:04:17.720
- Are you nervous?
- For the end?

1:04:17.787 --> 1:04:19.755
Engagement.

1:04:19.822 --> 1:04:22.692
I want to make things work and
I want to see it through.

1:04:22.758 --> 1:04:25.127
I've been looking for Kamil
to kind of step up.

1:04:25.194 --> 1:04:27.129
I'm just hoping that
he's as serious

1:04:27.196 --> 1:04:29.031
about this
relationship as I am.

1:04:29.098 --> 1:04:31.934
Normally like, this is the time
where I hit the panic button.

1:04:35.037 --> 1:04:37.306
Right when things are
settling down a bit,

1:04:37.373 --> 1:04:38.975
we're gonna mix it up.

1:04:39.041 --> 1:04:41.410
- Woohoo!
- Holy shit!

1:04:41.477 --> 1:04:43.312
I'm sure there's a couple
smooches going on.

1:04:43.379 --> 1:04:44.280
Honestly, you seem
like a nice guy and

1:04:44.347 --> 1:04:47.450
I don't want to hurt you so,
don't ask Vay.

1:04:47.516 --> 1:04:48.951
You took her on the date,
didn't you?

1:04:49.018 --> 1:04:49.919
- I did.
- How was that?

1:04:49.986 --> 1:04:50.820
Fantastic.

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:53.823
Josh, he's not really
competition, no.

1:04:53.889 --> 1:04:56.092
I'm on the chopping block.
"Cha-cha"!

1:04:56.158 --> 1:04:58.127
You just kept feeding me,
like,

1:04:58.194 --> 1:05:00.763
all these like amazing
things about her.

1:05:00.830 --> 1:05:02.365
I think any girl would feel
like shit hearing that.

1:05:02.431 --> 1:05:03.766
Yeah, absolutely.

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:05.401
I'm not feeling too
good right now.

1:05:07.336 --> 1:05:09.005
I was just...

1:05:09.071 --> 1:05:12.875
Vay is getting in my head
more than I already was.

1:05:12.942 --> 1:05:14.744
I wasn't trying to side
with someone else.

1:05:14.810 --> 1:05:16.913
I was just trying to help
someone who had

1:05:16.979 --> 1:05:18.281
no one at the time.

1:05:18.347 --> 1:05:21.017
I'm scared of losing her.

1:05:23.986 --> 1:05:25.922
But wait, there is more.

1:05:26.856 --> 1:05:28.324
I'll ask you all to
close your eyes.

1:05:28.391 --> 1:05:31.260
It feels like my entire
30-year existence has

1:05:31.327 --> 1:05:33.129
culminated up
until this point.

1:05:33.195 --> 1:05:35.231
Alright, everyone,
open your eyes.

1:05:40.436 --> 1:05:42.038
Who would've known
that there's so many

1:05:42.104 --> 1:05:44.206
amazing piano
players in one group?

1:05:47.810 --> 1:05:49.345
What?

1:05:55.851 --> 1:05:57.954
Get it together, Vay.
Alright.

1:05:58.020 --> 1:05:59.422
- Oh!
- Woo!

1:05:59.488 --> 1:06:01.757
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

1:06:03.125 --> 1:06:05.227
- Woo!
-
