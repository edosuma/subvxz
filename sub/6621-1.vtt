00:34.287 --> 00:37.757
Dwarfed by the vast expanse
of the open ocean,

00:37.927 --> 00:41.476
the biggest animal
that has ever lived on our planet.

00:48.287 --> 00:53.077
A blue whale, 30 metres long
and weighing over 200 tonnes.

00:53.247 --> 00:56.796
It's far bigger
than even the biggest dinosaur.

00:58.447 --> 01:01.598
Its tongue weighs
as much as an elephant.

01:01.767 --> 01:03.758
Its heart is the size of a car,

01:03.927 --> 01:07.124
and some of its blood vessels
are so wide

01:07.287 --> 01:09.278
that you could swim down them.

01:10.887 --> 01:12.605
Its tail alone

01:12.767 --> 01:16.077
is the width
of a small aircraft's wings.

01:33.327 --> 01:36.558
Its streamlining,
close to perfection,

01:36.727 --> 01:38.843
enables it to cruise at 20 knots.

01:39.007 --> 01:42.204
It's one of the fastest animals
in the sea.

01:46.247 --> 01:48.442
The ocean's largest inhabitant

01:48.607 --> 01:51.997
feeds almost exclusively
on one of the smallest -

01:52.167 --> 01:55.603
krill, a crustacean
just a few centimetres long.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.198
Gathered in a shoal,

02:01.447 --> 02:03.438
krill stain the sea red,

02:03.607 --> 02:07.600
and a single blue whale in a day
can consume 40 million of them.

02:16.247 --> 02:19.239
Despite the enormous size
of blue whales,

02:19.407 --> 02:21.398
we know very little about them.

02:21.567 --> 02:24.559
Their migration routes
are still a mystery,

02:24.727 --> 02:27.844
and we have absolutely no idea
where they go to breed.

02:31.527 --> 02:33.518
They are a dramatic reminder

02:33.687 --> 02:35.678
of how much we still have to learn

02:35.847 --> 02:39.237
about the ocean and the creatures
that live there.

02:42.367 --> 02:44.562
Our planet is a blue planet.

02:44.727 --> 02:47.958
Over 70 per cent of it
is covered by the sea.

02:50.287 --> 02:53.802
The Pacific Ocean alone
covers half the globe.

02:53.967 --> 02:57.164
You can fly across it non-stop
for 12 hours

02:57.327 --> 03:00.478
and still see nothing more
than a speck of land.

03:01.687 --> 03:03.279
This series will reveal

03:03.447 --> 03:06.644
the complete natural history
of our ocean planet

03:06.807 --> 03:11.039
from its familiar shores to
the mysteries of its deepest seas.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.278
By volume, the ocean makes up

03:24.447 --> 03:27.519
97 per cent of the earth's
inhabitable space,

03:27.687 --> 03:30.326
and the sheer quantity
of its marine life

03:30.487 --> 03:33.160
far exceeds that
which inhabits the land.

03:55.527 --> 03:59.884
But life in the ocean is not
evenly spread. It's regulated

04:00.047 --> 04:03.039
by the path of currents
carrying nutrients,

04:03.207 --> 04:05.277
and the varying power of the sun.

04:06.207 --> 04:11.156
In this first programme, we will
see how these two forces interact

04:11.327 --> 04:13.318
to control the distribution of life

04:13.487 --> 04:16.877
from the coral seas
to the polar wastes.

05:11.327 --> 05:14.285
The sheer physical power
of the ocean

05:14.447 --> 05:16.244
dominates our planet.

05:32.047 --> 05:35.676
It profoundly influences
the weather of all the world.

05:35.847 --> 05:40.477
Water vapour rising from it forms
the clouds and generates the storms

05:40.647 --> 05:43.115
that ultimately
will drench the land.

06:02.287 --> 06:05.279
The great waves that roar in
towards the shores

06:05.447 --> 06:08.439
are dramatic demonstrations
of its power.

06:23.247 --> 06:25.966
Waves originate far out at sea.

06:26.127 --> 06:29.563
There, even gentle breezes
can cause ripples,

06:29.727 --> 06:32.002
and ripples grow into swells.

06:41.927 --> 06:44.521
Out in the open ocean,
unimpeded by land,

06:44.687 --> 06:47.406
such swells can become gigantic.

07:09.487 --> 07:13.480
It's only when an ocean swell
eventually reaches shallow water

07:13.647 --> 07:15.638
that it starts to break.

07:22.647 --> 07:26.640
As it approaches the coast,
the water at the bottom of the swell

07:26.807 --> 07:29.367
is slowed by contact
with the seabed.

07:29.527 --> 07:32.519
The top of the swell,
still travelling fast,

07:32.687 --> 07:35.485
starts to roll over
and so the wave breaks.

08:07.287 --> 08:11.200
The ocean never rests. Huge currents,
such as the Gulf Stream,

08:11.367 --> 08:15.121
keep its waters constantly
on the move all round the globe.

08:15.287 --> 08:18.279
It's these currents
more than any other factor

08:18.447 --> 08:22.599
that control the distribution
of nutrients and life in the seas.

08:25.087 --> 08:28.602
A tiny island lost
in the midst of the Pacific.

08:28.767 --> 08:30.758
It's the tip of a huge mountain

08:30.927 --> 08:34.602
that rises from the sea floor
thousands of metres below.

08:39.847 --> 08:43.044
The nearest land is 300 miles away.

08:47.087 --> 08:49.760
Isolated sea mounts like this one

08:49.927 --> 08:52.566
create oases
where life can flourish

08:52.727 --> 08:56.276
in the comparatively empty expanses
of the open ocean.

09:04.887 --> 09:08.675
But all the creatures that swim
beside it would not be here

09:08.847 --> 09:10.997
were it not for one key factor -

09:12.167 --> 09:13.964
the deep ocean currents.

09:19.087 --> 09:23.080
Far below the surface,
they collide with the island's flanks

09:23.247 --> 09:25.397
and are deflected upwards,

09:25.567 --> 09:29.526
bringing with them from the depths
a rich soup of nutrients.

09:31.287 --> 09:35.599
Such up-wellings attract
great concentrations of life.

09:43.527 --> 09:46.519
Most of the fish here
are permanent residents

09:46.687 --> 09:50.475
feeding on plankton -
tiny floating plants and animals

09:50.647 --> 09:54.117
nourished by the richness
brought up from the depths,

09:54.287 --> 09:57.165
and they attract visitors
from the open ocean.

09:58.447 --> 09:59.766
Tuna.

10:25.607 --> 10:28.599
The plankton feeders
are easy targets.

10:39.287 --> 10:42.962
All this action attracts
even larger predators.

10:45.727 --> 10:47.080
Sharks.

10:51.687 --> 10:53.484
Hundreds of sharks.

10:55.967 --> 10:59.642
These silky sharks
are normally ocean-going species,

10:59.807 --> 11:02.605
but the sea mounts
in the eastern Pacific

11:02.767 --> 11:05.201
like Cocos, Mapelo
and the Galapagos,

11:05.367 --> 11:09.519
attract silkies in huge groups
up to 500 strong.

11:13.527 --> 11:16.883
Silkies seem to specialise
in taking injured fish

11:17.047 --> 11:19.197
and constantly circle sea mounts

11:19.367 --> 11:22.086
on the look out for the chance
to do so.

11:27.007 --> 11:29.475
But silkies are not
the only visitors.

11:33.287 --> 11:37.326
Hammerheads gather
in some of the largest shark shoals

11:37.487 --> 11:39.637
to be found anywhere in the ocean.

11:39.807 --> 11:43.641
Sometimes, thousands will circle
over a single sea mount.

11:48.447 --> 11:51.086
But these sharks are not here
for food.

11:51.247 --> 11:53.397
They have come for another reason.

11:56.287 --> 12:00.326
Some of the locals
provide a cleaning service.

12:03.687 --> 12:05.962
Following the last El NiÃ±o year,

12:06.127 --> 12:10.678
when a rise in water temperatures
gave many sharks fungal infections,

12:10.847 --> 12:13.884
the number of hammerheads
visiting the sea mounts

12:14.047 --> 12:15.844
reached record levels.

12:26.287 --> 12:29.040
Nutrients also well up
to the surface

12:29.207 --> 12:31.516
along the coasts of the continents.

12:33.087 --> 12:36.921
This is Natal
on South Africa's eastern seaboard.

12:37.087 --> 12:38.566
It's June,

12:38.727 --> 12:42.402
and just off-shore,
strange black patches have appeared.

12:45.927 --> 12:49.363
They look like immense oil slicks
up to a mile long.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.081
But this is a living slick:

12:54.247 --> 12:58.399
millions and millions of sardines
on a marine migration

12:58.567 --> 13:00.558
that in terms of sheer biomass,

13:00.727 --> 13:04.481
rivals that of the wildebeest
on the grasslands of Africa.

13:07.967 --> 13:11.755
These fish live mostly
in the cold waters south of the Cape,

13:11.927 --> 13:14.999
but each year
the coastal currents reverse.

13:15.167 --> 13:19.126
The warm Agulhas current
that flows down from the north

13:19.287 --> 13:22.359
has been displaced
by cold water from the south,

13:22.527 --> 13:24.995
and that has brought up
rich nutrients.

13:25.167 --> 13:28.477
They in turn have created
a bloom of plankton,

13:29.287 --> 13:31.926
and the sardines
are now feasting on it.

13:40.927 --> 13:42.918
As the sardines travel north,

13:43.087 --> 13:45.920
a whole caravan of predators
follow them.

13:49.367 --> 13:52.404
Thousands of Cape gannets
track the sardines.

13:52.567 --> 13:55.639
They nested off the Cape
and timed their breeding

13:55.807 --> 13:58.082
so that their newly-fledged chicks

13:58.247 --> 14:00.715
can join them
in pursuing the shoals.

14:07.287 --> 14:11.838
Below water, hundreds of sharks
have also joined the caravan.

14:14.687 --> 14:17.520
These are bronze whaler sharks,

14:17.687 --> 14:21.600
a cold water species that
normally lives much further south.

14:26.647 --> 14:28.922
These three-metre sharks

14:29.087 --> 14:32.318
cut such great swathes
through the sardine shoals

14:32.487 --> 14:35.160
that their tracks
are visible from the air.

14:35.327 --> 14:37.318
Harried by packs of predators

14:37.487 --> 14:40.479
and swept in
by the action of the waves,

14:40.647 --> 14:43.798
the sardine shoals are penned
close to the shore.

15:00.807 --> 15:05.801
Common dolphin are coming in
from the open ocean to join the feast.

15:20.327 --> 15:22.318
There are over a thousand of them

15:22.487 --> 15:24.478
in this one school.

15:31.807 --> 15:36.642
When they catch up with the sardines,
the action really begins.

15:40.687 --> 15:44.646
Working together, they drive
the shoal towards the surface.

15:52.687 --> 15:56.805
It's easier for the dolphins
to snatch fish up here.

16:10.767 --> 16:13.600
Now the sardines have no escape.

16:24.647 --> 16:26.638
Thanks to the dolphins,

16:26.807 --> 16:30.880
the sardines have come within
the diving range of the gannets.

16:42.087 --> 16:44.885
Hundreds of white arrows
shoot into the sea,

16:45.047 --> 16:48.517
leaving long trails of bubbles
behind each dive.

17:00.727 --> 17:03.321
Next to join the frenzy
are the sharks.

17:15.446 --> 17:19.076
Sharks get very excited
when dolphins are around.

17:19.247 --> 17:21.317
They can feed particularly well

17:21.487 --> 17:24.240
once the dolphins
have driven the sardines

17:24.406 --> 17:27.160
into more compact groups
near the surface.

17:30.687 --> 17:34.475
As the frenzy continues,
walls of bubbles drift upwards.

17:37.207 --> 17:39.767
They are being released
by the dolphins

17:39.927 --> 17:41.918
working together in teams.

17:44.287 --> 17:46.005
They use the bubbles

17:46.167 --> 17:49.284
to corral the sardines
into ever tighter groups.

17:52.607 --> 17:55.519
The sardines seldom cross
the wall of bubbles

17:55.687 --> 17:57.678
and crowd closer together.

18:01.047 --> 18:02.844
Bubble netting in this way,

18:03.007 --> 18:07.046
enables the dolphins to grab
every last trapped sardine.

18:18.487 --> 18:21.479
Just when the feasting
seems to be almost over,

18:21.647 --> 18:23.444
a Bryde's whale.

18:27.767 --> 18:30.076
The survivors head on northwards,

18:30.247 --> 18:33.045
and the caravan of predators
follows them.

18:41.127 --> 18:44.836
Nutrients can also be brought up,
though less predictably,

18:45.007 --> 18:46.998
by rough weather.

18:51.687 --> 18:55.316
Particularly near the poles,
huge storms stir the depths

18:55.487 --> 18:57.796
and enrich the surface waters,

18:57.967 --> 18:59.958
and here, in the South Atlantic,

19:00.127 --> 19:02.766
the seas are the roughest
on the planet.

19:06.327 --> 19:08.318
And very rich seas they are, too,

19:08.487 --> 19:11.797
for here, the cold Falklands
current from the south

19:11.967 --> 19:14.879
meets the warm Brazil current
from the north,

19:15.047 --> 19:17.720
and at their junction
is food in abundance.

19:19.487 --> 19:23.116
These black-browed albatross
are duck-diving for krill

19:23.287 --> 19:25.960
that has been driven up
to the surface.

19:29.047 --> 19:30.844
Like all albatross,

19:31.007 --> 19:34.920
black-brows are wanderers
across the face of the open ocean.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.124
A feeding assembly on this scale
is a rare sight.

19:53.287 --> 19:57.360
Most of the time, the birds
of the open sea are widely dispersed,

19:57.527 --> 20:01.998
but these feeding grounds are close
to an albatross breeding colony,

20:02.167 --> 20:03.998
and a very special one.

20:13.087 --> 20:15.078
This is Steeple Jason,

20:15.247 --> 20:18.319
a remote island
in the far west of the Falklands.

20:18.487 --> 20:21.559
It has the largest albatross colony
in the world.

20:30.087 --> 20:33.204
There are almost
half a million albatross here,

20:33.367 --> 20:37.360
an astonishing demonstration
of how fertile the ocean can be

20:37.527 --> 20:39.518
and how much food it can give

20:39.687 --> 20:42.838
even to creatures
that do not actually live in it.

21:08.367 --> 21:10.358
Nutrients by themselves

21:10.527 --> 21:13.758
are not enough to generate
these vast assemblies.

21:13.927 --> 21:16.999
The heat and light from the sun
is also essential

21:17.167 --> 21:20.477
for the growth of the microscopic
floating plants -

21:20.647 --> 21:22.797
the phytoplankton.

21:26.527 --> 21:31.282
And it's the phytoplankton that is
the basis of all life in the ocean.

21:37.687 --> 21:41.680
Every evening, the disappearance
of the sun below the horizon

21:41.847 --> 21:44.645
triggers the largest
migration of life

21:44.807 --> 21:46.798
that takes place on our planet.

21:53.967 --> 21:57.277
One thousand million tonnes
of sea creatures

21:57.447 --> 22:01.440
ascend from the deep ocean to
search for food near the surface.

22:08.407 --> 22:12.400
They graze on the phytoplankton
under cover of darkness.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.161
Even so, they are far from safe.

22:15.327 --> 22:17.557
Other marine hunters follow them,

22:17.727 --> 22:20.958
some travelling up
from hundreds of metres below.

23:19.807 --> 23:21.320
At dawn,

23:21.487 --> 23:25.526
the whole procession returns
to the safety of the dark depths.

23:31.687 --> 23:36.317
The moon, too, has a great
influence on life in the oceans.

23:37.687 --> 23:39.882
Its gravitational pull

23:40.047 --> 23:43.483
creates the daily advances
and retreats of the tide.

23:55.167 --> 23:58.159
But the moon has more
than a daily cycle.

23:58.327 --> 24:02.559
Each month, it waxes and wanes
as it travels round the earth,

24:02.727 --> 24:06.561
and this monthly cycle
also triggers events in the ocean.

24:09.807 --> 24:12.321
The Pacific coast of Costa Rica

24:12.487 --> 24:14.478
on a very special night.

24:14.647 --> 24:18.845
It's just after midnight
and the tide is coming in.

24:23.047 --> 24:25.561
The moon is in its last quarter,

24:25.727 --> 24:28.799
exactly half way
between full and new.

24:31.207 --> 24:33.880
For weeks,
the beach has been empty,

24:34.047 --> 24:36.038
but that is about to change.

24:36.207 --> 24:40.280
At high tide, turtles
start to emerge from the surf.

24:45.487 --> 24:48.479
At first, they come
in ones and twos,

24:48.647 --> 24:50.558
but within an hour,

24:50.727 --> 24:53.719
they are appearing
all along the beach.

24:59.007 --> 25:01.965
They are all female
Ridley's turtles,

25:02.127 --> 25:04.118
and over the next six days or so,

25:04.287 --> 25:07.643
400,000 will visit this one beach

25:07.807 --> 25:09.798
to lay their eggs in the sand.

25:17.647 --> 25:22.163
At the peak time, 5,000
are coming and going every hour.

25:22.327 --> 25:25.080
The top of the beach
gets so crowded

25:25.247 --> 25:28.842
that they have to clamber
over one another to find a patch

25:29.007 --> 25:30.998
where they can dig a nest hole.

25:36.087 --> 25:39.762
A quarter of the world's population
of Ridley's turtles

25:39.927 --> 25:43.476
come to this one beach
on a few key nights each year.

25:43.647 --> 25:45.638
The rest of the time,

25:45.807 --> 25:48.879
they are widely distributed
through the ocean,

25:49.487 --> 25:51.478
most, hundreds of miles away.

25:51.647 --> 25:56.323
This mass nesting is called
an arribada. How it's co-ordinated

25:56.487 --> 25:58.478
is a mystery,

25:58.647 --> 26:00.877
but we do know that arribadas start

26:01.047 --> 26:04.437
when the moon is either
in its first or last quarter.

26:11.807 --> 26:15.720
Forty million eggs are laid
in just a few days.

26:15.887 --> 26:19.516
By synchronising their nesting,
the females ensure

26:19.687 --> 26:22.884
that six weeks later,
their hatchlings will emerge

26:23.047 --> 26:25.038
in such enormous numbers

26:25.207 --> 26:27.596
that predators are overwhelmed,

26:27.767 --> 26:32.682
and a significant proportion of baby
turtles will make it to the water.

26:34.887 --> 26:38.436
But why do the females
use a cue from the moon

26:38.607 --> 26:40.916
to help synchronise their nesting?

26:41.087 --> 26:43.078
Part of the answer to that

26:43.247 --> 26:46.444
becomes clear at dawn
on the following morning.

27:07.007 --> 27:11.319
The day shift of predators
are arriving for their first meals.

27:16.487 --> 27:18.478
Vultures have learnt

27:18.647 --> 27:22.879
that the returning tide can wash
freshly laid eggs out of the sand.

27:25.287 --> 27:28.324
The risk of eggs being exposed
by the surf

27:28.487 --> 27:31.559
may be partly why
turtle arribadas tend to occur

27:31.727 --> 27:34.719
around the last or first quarter
of the moon.

27:38.287 --> 27:43.042
It's on such days as this when
the moon is neither full nor new,

27:43.207 --> 27:47.041
that the tides are weakest
and the sea is likely to be calmer.

28:01.687 --> 28:06.636
So it's easier for the female turtles
to make their way through the surf,

28:06.807 --> 28:09.799
and harder for eggs
to be washed out of the sand

28:09.967 --> 28:11.798
and taken by vultures.

28:23.327 --> 28:27.320
The moon's monthly cycle
and its influence on the tides

28:27.487 --> 28:29.717
triggers many events in the ocean,

28:29.887 --> 28:33.482
from the spawning of the corals
on the Great Barrier reef

28:33.647 --> 28:35.638
to the breeding cycles of fish,

28:35.807 --> 28:37.957
but there's an even longer rhythm

28:38.127 --> 28:40.721
that has the most profound effect
of all -

28:40.887 --> 28:42.878
the annual cycle of the sun.

28:45.007 --> 28:47.601
The sun's position
relative to the earth

28:47.767 --> 28:49.758
changes through the year,

28:49.927 --> 28:52.521
and it's this
that produces the seasons.

28:52.687 --> 28:54.484
In the north, spring comes

28:54.647 --> 28:57.480
as the sun begins to rise
higher in the sky.

28:58.287 --> 29:00.721
Off the coast
of north west America,

29:00.887 --> 29:05.165
the seas are transformed by
the increasing strength of the sun.

29:10.087 --> 29:13.443
Here in Alaska,
the coastal waters turn green

29:13.607 --> 29:16.075
with a sudden bloom
of phytoplankton.

29:19.087 --> 29:22.159
Herring that have spent the winter
far out to sea

29:22.327 --> 29:26.878
time their return to the shallow
waters to coincide with this bloom.

29:27.047 --> 29:29.083
They come in vast numbers

29:29.247 --> 29:33.365
and initiate one of the most productive
food chains in all the oceans.

29:48.287 --> 29:51.836
Humpback whales
are at the top of that food chain.

29:52.007 --> 29:53.998
They have spent the winter

29:54.167 --> 29:57.477
breeding in the warmer
tropical waters off Hawaii,

29:57.647 --> 29:59.638
but there was little food there.

29:59.807 --> 30:01.798
This herring bonanza

30:01.967 --> 30:05.243
provides the majority of their food
for the year.

30:25.087 --> 30:27.476
Stellar and Californian sea lions

30:27.647 --> 30:32.163
also return from the open ocean
each year to feast off the herring.

30:42.527 --> 30:46.281
The herring, however,
have not come here for food.

30:46.447 --> 30:49.484
They are about to breed.
Nothing deters them

30:49.647 --> 30:52.798
as they head
for even shallower waters.

30:54.447 --> 30:56.438
Now the waters are so shallow

30:56.607 --> 30:58.484
that glaucous-winged gulls

30:58.647 --> 31:01.684
can snatch live fish
from just below the surface.

31:13.287 --> 31:16.085
In spite of these attacks,
the herring swim on

31:16.247 --> 31:18.363
until they reach the vegetation

31:18.527 --> 31:21.166
that the females need
if they are to lay.

31:27.287 --> 31:30.438
Each female produces
around 20,000 eggs,

31:30.607 --> 31:32.916
and they're very sticky.

31:36.807 --> 31:40.880
After the females have spawned,
the males release their sperm

31:41.047 --> 31:43.038
in vast, milky clouds.

31:47.967 --> 31:52.006
Soon, the excesses
of the herrings' sexual spree

31:52.167 --> 31:55.637
creates a thick white scum
on the surface.

31:57.047 --> 31:59.038
Through the season,

31:59.207 --> 32:02.597
curds of sperm clog the shores
for hundreds of miles

32:02.767 --> 32:06.442
from British Columbia in the south
to Alaska in the north.

32:12.607 --> 32:16.885
After a few days, this gigantic
spawning comes to an end,

32:17.047 --> 32:20.039
and the herring
head back out to deeper waters,

32:20.207 --> 32:22.596
leaving behind them fertilised eggs

32:22.767 --> 32:25.998
plastered on every rock
and strand of vegetation.

32:36.607 --> 32:41.806
They time the spawning so that two
weeks later, when the eggs hatch,

32:41.967 --> 32:46.085
the annual plankton bloom will be
at its height, and the fish fry

32:46.247 --> 32:48.238
will have plenty to eat.

32:48.407 --> 32:50.716
In the meantime,
these eggs provide food

32:50.887 --> 32:54.197
for armies of different animals
below and above the surface.

33:02.127 --> 33:06.518
Millions of birds arrive to collect
a share of the herrings' bounty.

33:06.687 --> 33:08.678
Some of it is easily gathered,

33:08.847 --> 33:12.396
for millions of eggs have been
washed up onto the shore.

33:13.287 --> 33:15.278
This encapsulated energy

33:15.447 --> 33:19.076
is particularly valuable
to migrating birds.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.317
These surfbirds are on their way

33:21.487 --> 33:25.958
to their breeding grounds in
the Arctic and come down to refuel.

33:26.127 --> 33:29.199
Stranded herring eggs
are just what they need.

33:31.247 --> 33:33.283
Bonaparte gulls collect the eggs

33:33.447 --> 33:35.642
just below the surface
of the water.

33:38.367 --> 33:42.155
Further out in the bay,
huge flocks of ducks have gathered.

33:42.327 --> 33:44.283
They're mostly surf scoters -

33:44.447 --> 33:48.440
diving ducks that can feed
off the bottom several metres down.

33:52.287 --> 33:55.279
There are such huge quantities
of eggs,

33:55.447 --> 33:57.438
that even a big animal like a bear

33:57.607 --> 33:59.962
finds it worthwhile
to collect them.

34:03.287 --> 34:06.597
The spawning of the herring
is a crucial event

34:06.767 --> 34:09.839
in the lives of many animals
all along the coast.

34:10.007 --> 34:13.317
The whole event coincides
with the plankton bloom,

34:13.487 --> 34:16.239
and within three short weeks,
it's all over.

34:21.286 --> 34:25.565
The migratory birds leave
to continue their journey north.

34:33.087 --> 34:37.080
They will not come back until
the herring also return next year.

34:43.286 --> 34:45.516
As the herring spawning finishes,

34:45.687 --> 34:48.884
other migrants
are starting to arrive offshore.

34:51.286 --> 34:53.083
Grey whales.

34:57.807 --> 34:59.957
They have followed the sun north,

35:00.127 --> 35:02.357
and they too are seeking the food

35:02.527 --> 35:05.519
generated by the bloom
of the phytoplankton.

35:08.207 --> 35:12.519
Krill are feeding off it, and these
whales are feeding on the krill,

35:12.687 --> 35:16.600
skimming it from the surface
with the filter plates of baleen

35:16.767 --> 35:18.837
that hang from their upper jaws.

35:20.287 --> 35:23.279
Grey whales make
one of the longest migrations

35:23.447 --> 35:25.403
of any marine mammal -

35:25.567 --> 35:28.127
a round trip of 12,000 miles or so

35:28.287 --> 35:31.279
from their breeding grounds
off Mexico

35:31.447 --> 35:35.599
along the entire coast of North
America up to the Arctic Ocean.

35:38.327 --> 35:40.318
They travel close to the coast,

35:40.487 --> 35:44.162
with the males and non-breeding
females leading the way.

35:44.327 --> 35:48.923
The last to start are cows
that have just given birth.

35:49.087 --> 35:53.080
They have to wait until their calves
are sufficiently strong

35:53.247 --> 35:55.283
to tackle such an immense journey.

35:56.487 --> 35:59.285
Their progress is necessarily slow.

35:59.447 --> 36:01.517
The mothers stay with their young,

36:01.687 --> 36:05.157
and even a strong calf
only travels at a couple of knots.

36:06.967 --> 36:09.276
They stick even closer
to the shore,

36:09.447 --> 36:11.438
often within just 200 metres.

36:15.287 --> 36:17.005
Killer whales.

36:17.167 --> 36:21.160
They have learnt that grey whales
follow traditional routes.

36:21.327 --> 36:23.318
The killers have no trouble

36:23.487 --> 36:27.082
in overtaking the calf
and its devoted mother.

36:30.967 --> 36:34.118
Normally, they continually call
to one another,

36:34.287 --> 36:36.562
but now they have fallen silent.

36:36.727 --> 36:38.718
The grey whale and her calf

36:38.887 --> 36:41.879
have no idea
that they've been targeted.

37:01.847 --> 37:06.318
Catching up with the grey whales
is the easy part for the killers.

37:06.487 --> 37:08.079
They have to be cautious

37:08.247 --> 37:11.444
for they are only
about half the size of the mother.

37:14.927 --> 37:18.124
She can inflict real damage
with her tail.

37:27.327 --> 37:29.557
But the killers are after her calf.

37:29.727 --> 37:33.606
As long as the mother can keep it
on the move, it will be safe,

37:33.767 --> 37:36.884
and she does her best
to hurry it along.

37:39.287 --> 37:44.122
At first, the killers avoid getting
too close but just stay alongside.

37:44.287 --> 37:49.077
They know that the calf, going at
this speed, will eventually tire.

37:59.087 --> 38:01.282
After three hours of being harried,

38:01.447 --> 38:04.757
the calf becomes too exhausted
to swim any further.

38:04.927 --> 38:06.918
The mother has to stop.

38:07.087 --> 38:10.477
This is the moment the killers
have been waiting for.

38:10.887 --> 38:14.960
They start to try and force
themselves between mother and calf.

38:35.727 --> 38:39.959
A calf separated from its mother
will not be able to defend itself.

38:40.127 --> 38:43.119
Time and again,
the black fins of the killers

38:43.287 --> 38:45.482
appear between the grey whales.

38:56.487 --> 38:58.478
At last the killers succeed,

38:58.647 --> 39:01.639
and now they've got the calf
on its own,

39:01.807 --> 39:03.798
they change their tactics.

39:03.967 --> 39:07.357
They leap right onto the calf,
and try to push it under.

39:18.287 --> 39:20.278
They are trying to drown it.

39:30.447 --> 39:33.439
The calf snatches
a desperate breath.

39:46.007 --> 39:48.999
The mother becomes
increasingly agitated.

39:49.167 --> 39:52.921
Frantically, she tries to push
her calf back to the surface

39:53.087 --> 39:55.078
so that it can breathe.

39:57.407 --> 39:59.318
But now it's so exhausted

39:59.487 --> 40:02.559
that it has to be supported
by its mother's body.

40:19.407 --> 40:21.398
The killers won't give up.

40:21.567 --> 40:25.560
Like a pack of wolves, they take
turns in harassing the whales.

40:46.287 --> 40:48.847
Now, the whole pod is involved.

40:59.007 --> 41:01.646
One of them takes a bite.

41:14.447 --> 41:17.723
Soon, the sea is reddened
with the calf's blood,

41:17.887 --> 41:20.879
and the killers close in
for the final act.

41:42.207 --> 41:44.004
The calf is dead.

41:48.287 --> 41:50.278
After a six-hour hunt,

41:50.447 --> 41:53.644
the killer whales
have finally won their prize.

41:59.087 --> 42:01.078
The mother, bereft,

42:01.247 --> 42:04.284
has to continue her migration north
on her own.

42:08.687 --> 42:11.679
She leaves behind
the carcass of a calf

42:11.847 --> 42:15.476
that she cherished for 13 months
in her womb,

42:15.647 --> 42:19.037
for which she delayed
her own journey to find food.

42:21.967 --> 42:26.119
The 15 killer whales spent over
six hours trying to kill the calf,

42:26.287 --> 42:28.403
but having succeeded,

42:28.567 --> 42:33.322
they've eaten nothing more
than its lower jaw and its tongue.

42:41.287 --> 42:45.360
Valuable food like this
will not go to waste in the ocean.

42:45.527 --> 42:48.917
Before long, the carcass
will sink to the very bottom

42:49.087 --> 42:50.759
of this deep sea,

42:50.927 --> 42:53.919
but even there its flesh
will not be wasted.

42:56.727 --> 43:00.561
Over a mile down, in the total
darkness of the deep ocean,

43:00.727 --> 43:02.922
the body of another grey whale,

43:03.087 --> 43:04.566
a 30-tonne adult.

43:04.727 --> 43:07.764
It settled here
only a few weeks ago.

43:09.927 --> 43:13.124
Already, it has attracted
hundreds of hagfish.

43:19.207 --> 43:23.359
These scavengers, over half a metre
long and as thick as your arm,

43:23.527 --> 43:26.041
are only found in the deep sea.

43:26.207 --> 43:29.643
They have been attracted
by the faint whiff of decay

43:29.807 --> 43:33.004
suffusing through the water
for miles around.

43:36.287 --> 43:39.404
With their heads buried
in the whale's flesh,

43:39.567 --> 43:43.242
they breathe through gill openings
along their sides.

43:43.407 --> 43:45.716
They're very primitive creatures -

43:45.887 --> 43:48.879
not even true fish
for they lack jaws.

43:49.047 --> 43:51.038
They feed, not by biting,

43:51.207 --> 43:54.802
but by rasping off flesh
with two rows of horny teeth.

43:56.647 --> 43:58.558
In just a few hours,

43:58.727 --> 44:02.800
a hagfish can eat several times
its own weight of rotting flesh.

44:05.887 --> 44:07.878
Next to arrive,

44:08.047 --> 44:10.038
a sleeper shark.

44:16.207 --> 44:19.404
It moves so slowly
to conserve energy -

44:19.567 --> 44:22.718
an important strategy
for so large an animal

44:22.887 --> 44:25.037
surviving in such a poor habitat.

44:31.527 --> 44:34.325
Sleeper sharks live
over a mile down,

44:34.487 --> 44:36.842
and grow to over seven metres long.

44:39.607 --> 44:43.441
They can go for months
without food, slowly cruising along,

44:43.607 --> 44:45.518
waiting for rare bonanzas

44:45.687 --> 44:47.484
such as this one

44:47.647 --> 44:49.444
to arrive from above.

44:56.087 --> 44:59.284
A whole range of different
deep-sea scavengers

44:59.447 --> 45:02.439
will feast on this carcass
for a long time

45:02.607 --> 45:05.804
before all its nutriment
has been consumed.

45:07.087 --> 45:08.679
18 months later,

45:08.847 --> 45:12.999
all that is left is a perfect
skeleton stripped bare.

45:15.687 --> 45:19.839
The sun's energy, that was captured
and turned into living tissue

45:20.007 --> 45:21.998
by the floating phytoplankton,

45:22.167 --> 45:25.716
has been transferred
to another link in the food chain,

45:25.887 --> 45:29.800
and has ended up as far away from
the sun as it is possible to be -

45:29.967 --> 45:31.958
at the bottom of the deep sea.

45:32.127 --> 45:36.040
But some energy
also returns from the deep.

45:42.087 --> 45:46.239
Millions of opalescent squid
are on their way to the shallows.

45:46.407 --> 45:48.841
They've come up here to mate.

45:49.007 --> 45:53.205
As the males grab the females,
their tentacles flush red.

45:55.687 --> 45:57.325
For most of the year,

45:57.487 --> 46:00.604
these squid live
at a depth of around 500 metres.

46:00.767 --> 46:04.476
They are part of these breeding
schools for a few weeks.

46:04.647 --> 46:07.844
Just one school was estimated
to contain animals

46:08.007 --> 46:10.316
that weigh around 4,000 tonnes.

46:21.127 --> 46:24.244
Wave after wave
rise from the depths,

46:24.407 --> 46:26.637
and soon the seabed
in the shallows

46:26.807 --> 46:31.198
is strewn with dense patches of
egg capsules several metres across.

46:36.527 --> 46:39.599
As each female
adds another capsule to the pile,

46:39.767 --> 46:42.964
the males fight
to fertilise its contents.

46:58.287 --> 47:01.438
The squid make their huge journey
into the shallows

47:01.607 --> 47:05.839
because their eggs will develop
faster in the warmer water here,

47:06.007 --> 47:09.238
and when the young emerge,
they will find more food

47:09.407 --> 47:12.604
more easily than they would
in the ocean depths.

47:16.687 --> 47:18.678
Dawn the next morning,

47:18.847 --> 47:22.635
and the seabed for miles around
is covered in egg capsules.

47:22.807 --> 47:26.083
The squid have all gone.
Many have died,

47:26.247 --> 47:29.637
but some will have returned
to their home in the deep.

47:29.807 --> 47:32.799
They will not return
to the light of the sun

47:32.967 --> 47:36.926
until the next time they are
driven up by the urge to spawn.
