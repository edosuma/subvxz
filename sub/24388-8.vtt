I am a Lowly Apprentice Do-Good Trooper,

to Lofty Squire Do-Good Trooper.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.687
To accomplish this dream,
I need just one more sticker

for my achievement helmet,
the Neighborhood Service sticker.

It requires me to help out
every single neighbor on my block.

how can I do good for you today?"

Yes! One last neighbor to...

Well, I am out of the Do-Good Troopers!

02:08.044 --> 02:10.213
-Whoa, buddy. Everything okay?
-What happened?

02:10.296 --> 02:14.259
Nothing. I'm just never gonna be
a Lofty Squire Do-Good Trooper ever!

02:36.614 --> 02:40.368
Jimbo and I were doing our morning patrol
of the neighborhood when...

-I saw a fire truck!
-[cat growling]

02:42.495 --> 02:45.707

by one of Bootsy's kittens. Oh!

They're getting bolder.

Miss McCrackin's house? Tim, honey,
there's nothing there to be afraid of.

02:59.721 --> 03:02.557
But it's old and dark
and creepy and gross.

03:02.640 --> 03:04.809
I can feel my breakfast coming up
just thinking about--

03:04.893 --> 03:05.977
-[Mom] Bucket.
-[Dad] Clear!

03:06.060 --> 03:08.938
-I'm not actually throwing up.
-Oh, good.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.565
Honey, Wendi's a nice lady.

03:10.648 --> 03:14.193
She goes to Book Club,
she knits me a sweater every Christmas.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.738
She-- I don't know.
She probably pays her taxes.

03:16.821 --> 03:19.866
-Danny Petrosky told me--
-Ugh, that kid.

03:19.949 --> 03:23.953
Danny said Miss McCrackin
turns kids into robots.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.204
[snorts, laughs]

03:25.288 --> 03:28.499
Robots? Oh, man,
that Danny sure cracks me up.

03:28.583 --> 03:33.046
Tim, no one is able to turn a kid
into a robot. I know you know that.

03:33.129 --> 03:35.506
Do you really want me to take that chance?

03:35.590 --> 03:37.967
No chance, sport. We promise.

03:38.259 --> 03:40.345
-[Tim] Um...
-[cat yowls]

03:40.428 --> 03:43.973
Did I ever tell you that when I was
your age, I wasn't even allowed

03:44.057 --> 03:46.392
-to be a Do-Good Trooper?
-Because you were a girl?

03:46.809 --> 03:49.646
No. It was because
they thought I had a big head,

03:49.729 --> 03:53.441
and it wouldn't fit into the helmet,
which is obviously not the case.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.860
Girls' heads just grow faster than boys'.

03:55.944 --> 03:58.029
-That's science.
-That's not science.

03:58.112 --> 04:01.199
-Uh, agree to disagree.
-I don't agree to that.

04:02.450 --> 04:05.036
The point is,
your mother's head is lovely.

04:05.119 --> 04:09.666
Thank you, Ted. But the other point is,
you can't judge a book by its cover.

04:09.749 --> 04:13.503
The Troopers judged me, and now
that's what you're doing with Wendi,

04:13.586 --> 04:14.837
and it's wrong.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.632
Timothy Leslie Templeton.

04:17.715 --> 04:20.718
Are you listening to me?
What are you even looking at out--?

-Let's mail it to the ocean.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.943
Not how the postal system works. Staci.

04:37.026 --> 04:40.280
We could take it to the junkyard
and see if they'll strip it for parts.

04:40.363 --> 04:43.074
-Tempting, but no.
-[Tim] I don't wanna be a robot!

04:43.157 --> 04:47.704
Timothy Templeton,
we are going to help Wendi.

04:47.912 --> 04:51.082
You can't bail on neighborhood service
just because a nice lady chooses to live

04:51.165 --> 04:53.084
in a weird old house
with a bunch of cats.

04:53.167 --> 04:55.378
[gasps] House full of cats?

04:55.461 --> 04:58.798
We are going to march over there
and do our Do-Good duty!

04:58.881 --> 05:02.260
"Our"? Sounds like you're really
holding onto something, Janice.

05:02.343 --> 05:03.344
[slurps]

05:04.804 --> 05:06.597
Listen to your mother, Tim!

05:07.181 --> 05:10.018
I have an outside-the-box idea.
Let's roll.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.311
-Yeah!
-[Jimbo chuckles]

05:12.645 --> 05:15.023
Suit up, Trooper.
Let me put the baby down,

05:15.106 --> 05:17.859
and then we are going earn you
that helmet sticker.

05:18.276 --> 05:20.903
Oh, I guess your dad got him.

05:24.407 --> 05:29.329
[cats yowling]

05:29.412 --> 05:31.164
Why so many cats?

05:32.832 --> 05:35.668
Who cares? It's the perfect cat prison.

05:37.545 --> 05:41.924
Shove this killer kitty in there,
and Wendi, as unhinged as she is,

05:42.008 --> 05:44.302
will be thrilled to gain another fleabag.

05:44.385 --> 05:47.972
You know, because she's... [meows]
Now, hit it, Big J!

-[Mom] Come on, Tim.
-[gasps]

06:24.884 --> 06:29.597
-What do we do, sir? What do we do?
-Mom and Tim. Cats.

06:30.181 --> 06:32.767
But Mom and Tim! But cats.

06:34.310 --> 06:36.562
Come on, what's it gonna be, Boss?

06:36.646 --> 06:39.440
Staci, I guess we've got to go...

06:39.524 --> 06:43.277
into the belly of the den
of the house of the nest of cats!

06:45.738 --> 06:46.739
Huh?

06:48.825 --> 06:51.160
Don't hate me for being prepared.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.997
Cats are evil but dumb.
If we act just like them,

06:55.081 --> 06:58.626
we can go in there,
stay off their radar, and save Jimbo!

06:58.709 --> 07:00.753
[sighs] My shame is complete.

07:05.007 --> 07:08.594
[Boss] It's pitch black in here.
Can cats see in the dark?

07:08.970 --> 07:12.723
[Staci] Uh, I think that's dogs. Cats are
the ones that can smell your fear.

07:12.807 --> 07:14.183
[Boss] No, that's dogs.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.686
[Staci] Um, sir, I'm happy
to sit here in the dark,

07:16.769 --> 07:19.647
arguing about which animals
have which lame superpower,

07:19.730 --> 07:21.983
but if we're gonna find Jimbo...

[cats meowing]

07:24.152 --> 07:25.361
[hissing]

07:29.031 --> 07:32.452
Oh, aren't you little fur babies
the cutest?

07:34.245 --> 07:37.957
I bet you two strays are dying
for a dish of milk.

07:38.040 --> 07:41.210
[cats yowling, hissing]

07:45.089 --> 07:47.550
-[whispers] Where's Jimbo?
-Back there?

07:49.093 --> 07:50.303
[doorbell rings]

07:50.511 --> 07:52.847
Ugh! It's probably people.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.185
Now's our chance.
Let's go check that back room for Jim--

07:59.103 --> 08:03.608
I don't know if I can do this. Ahh!
Scratch that. I can, but I don't want to.

08:03.691 --> 08:07.195
Just pull yourself together
and don't make any sudden movements.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.280
Sudden movements?
But you just slapped me--

08:09.363 --> 08:11.157
Forget about it. Just blend in.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.784
Meow?

08:15.745 --> 08:20.833
Good morning, sir or... ma'am.
Ma'am. So, um, never mind. Bye!

08:20.917 --> 08:23.961
Wendi, always a pleasure.
Here's the lowdown.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.631
My son needs to help you
with something around the house

08:26.714 --> 08:29.342
to earn his last
Do-Good Trooper helmet sticker.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.721
It's very important to me.
But to him as well.

08:33.804 --> 08:35.890
I'm busy, Janice. I've got cats.

08:35.973 --> 08:40.645
And I respect that, but you know kids,
how they just won't let go of that thing

08:40.728 --> 08:44.065
they want more than anything,
which is my Timmy here.

08:44.649 --> 08:45.733
Ugh!

08:45.816 --> 08:48.152
The sooner we start, the sooner we leave.

08:48.903 --> 08:52.907
Fine. Got a lot of stuff in the backyard
I've been meaning to haul away.

08:53.491 --> 08:58.079
Would that be good enough for you?
I mean, for your son Tim?

08:58.162 --> 09:00.998
Uh, the "outside-ier," the better.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.254
Have at it.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.717
[robot beeping, whirring]

09:22.979 --> 09:26.190
-[screams]
-Well, this was unexpected,

09:26.274 --> 09:29.902
but can't wait
to get "McCrackin" on this, Wendi!

09:29.986 --> 09:33.197
House is off-limits.
That's non-negotiable.

09:33.281 --> 09:37.868
Ring the bell when you're done.
Or you could just leave. [chuckles]

09:37.952 --> 09:40.997
-Do that one.
-You've got yourself a deal!

09:41.080 --> 09:44.542
Ugh! My fur babies don't like
smelling other people.

09:47.336 --> 09:52.425
This'll be fun! Just think of it as one
of your Dekker Moonboots adventures.

09:52.508 --> 09:57.179
Don't you get it, Mom? This is the metal
she uses to turn kids into robots!

09:57.263 --> 10:01.017
This evil is everything
Dekker Moonboots stands against!

10:01.100 --> 10:03.728
Tim, if you're trying
to get out of doing some work,

10:03.811 --> 10:05.730
the scope of which I did not anticipate--

10:05.813 --> 10:09.108
I'm not, I swear!
I just love my body the way it is.

10:09.191 --> 10:13.237
And that's a beautiful thing, Tim,
but it's not an excuse.

10:13.321 --> 10:15.197
Grab some metal.
You're building character.

10:16.115 --> 10:16.949
[sighs]

10:19.910 --> 10:21.162
[cats meowing]

10:21.245 --> 10:23.873
I'm getting the sense
they don't believe we're cats.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.751
This is the only way
we're gonna find and rescue Jimbo.

10:26.834 --> 10:30.546
We gotta make them believe. [grunting]

10:30.630 --> 10:35.259

[giggling]

11:10.002 --> 11:13.255

-[mimics explosion]
-I don't know what you think you saw,

11:16.509 --> 11:20.179
but I went in there strictly for show.

We did it! We're in!

11:34.693 --> 11:38.572
Let's go get Jimbo! And never speak
of that litter incident again.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.037
Too big. Safe from being robotomized.

11:45.121 --> 11:48.207
[grunts] Tim, that doesn't go on your arm.

11:48.499 --> 11:49.917
And it never will!

Come on, back to work.

a hernia working for this sticker.

12:46.765 --> 12:48.934
Help me move... whatever this is.

12:49.018 --> 12:51.020
I think you mean "whoever."

12:51.395 --> 12:55.775
I think you mean "whomever," and I think
you're not learning your lesson.

12:58.152 --> 13:01.030
Timmy, I know you have
a powerful imagination,

13:01.113 --> 13:03.532
but I need you to remember
why we're doing this.

13:03.616 --> 13:05.826
Because judging a book
by its cover is wrong,

13:05.910 --> 13:09.079
because Mommy's head
was and is of regulation size,
