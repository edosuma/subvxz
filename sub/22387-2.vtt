>> I'm mark shortland.
I'm 42,

northampton.

03:08.822 --> 03:09.888
Northampton.
I'd count myself as a lucky

03:09.890 --> 03:10.789
I'd count myself as a lucky
person.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.391
Person.
I'm the sort of person that

03:12.393 --> 03:13.659
I'm the sort of person that
never seems to have a really

03:13.661 --> 03:14.793
never seems to have a really
bad round of golf,

03:14.795 --> 03:15.928
bad round of golf,
or if I need a few quid,

03:15.930 --> 03:17.930
or if I need a few quid,
then it just appears from

03:17.932 --> 03:19.298
then it just appears from
nowhere.

03:19.300 --> 03:20.899
Nowhere.
I was 26 when I came into

16 years now.
The trick that I'm going to

03:27.241 --> 03:29.441
the trick that I'm going to
do is going to rely solely

03:29.443 --> 03:30.943
do is going to rely solely
on chance.

03:30.945 --> 03:31.910
On chance.
The reason why I think it's

03:31.912 --> 03:33.445
the reason why I think it's
going to fool penn and teller

03:33.447 --> 03:34.646
going to fool penn and teller
this evening is because

03:34.648 --> 03:35.464
this evening is because
they're going to be looking

03:35.465 --> 03:36.281
they're going to be looking
for some kind of

03:36.283 --> 03:37.783
for some kind of
logical explanation,

03:37.785 --> 03:38.584
logical explanation,
but actually,

03:38.586 --> 03:39.918
but actually,
there isn't really one.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.587
There isn't really one.

It's fine.
While you're doing that,

04:52.693 --> 04:53.558
while you're doing that,
I'll entertain the audience

04:53.560 --> 04:54.926
I'll entertain the audience
with a couple of jokes.

04:54.928 --> 04:56.528
With a couple of jokes.

>> I'm not going to go that far.

16:38.665 --> 16:39.514
>> I'm not going to go that far.
I'm not that desperate.

16:39.515 --> 16:40.364
I'm not that desperate.
Okay.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.566
Okay.
Although it's coming.

16:41.568 --> 16:42.433
Although it's coming.
>> Oh, boy,

16:42.435 --> 16:43.368
>> oh, boy,
that's a good trick.

16:43.370 --> 16:45.003
That's a good trick.
That's an astonishing trick.

16:45.005 --> 16:47.271
That's an astonishing trick.
And first thing we're going to

16:47.273 --> 16:49.340
and first thing we're going to
look at is if there was any sort

16:49.342 --> 16:51.376
look at is if there was any sort
of force of the card.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.410
Of force of the card.
Once there's a force of the

16:52.412 --> 16:53.378
once there's a force of the
card,

16:53.380 --> 16:55.313
card,
that trick becomes trivial.

16:55.315 --> 16:56.614
That trick becomes trivial.
The most important part of

16:56.616 --> 16:58.449
the most important part of
this trick is for you to

16:58.451 --> 17:00.218
this trick is for you to
convince the audience that

17:00.220 --> 17:01.586
convince the audience that
that was a free choice of

17:01.588 --> 17:02.387
that was a free choice of
the card.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.388
The card.
The throwing the ball around

17:04.391 --> 17:06.391
the throwing the ball around
absolutely did that.

17:06.393 --> 17:08.026
Absolutely did that.
You did not know what card

17:08.028 --> 17:09.193
you did not know what card
was going to be picked when

17:09.194 --> 17:11.162
was going to be picked when
this trick started.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.030
This trick started.
Yeah.

17:12.031 --> 17:12.530
Yeah.
Okay.

17:12.531 --> 17:15.633
Okay.
Usually, magicians, even things

17:15.635 --> 17:17.068
usually, magicians, even things
they don't care about,

17:17.069 --> 17:19.170
they don't care about,
they actually do care about.

17:19.172 --> 17:21.339
They actually do care about.
You didn't care at all that

17:21.340 --> 17:22.740
you didn't care at all that
your cards were in that box

17:22.742 --> 17:23.741
your cards were in that box
to start.

17:23.742 --> 17:25.143
To start.
That was just nice.

17:25.145 --> 17:26.511
That was just nice.
That was just fancy.

17:26.512 --> 17:28.413
That was just fancy.
That was just beautiful.

17:28.415 --> 17:29.714
That was just beautiful.
The box doesn't matter.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.749
The box doesn't matter.
Well, we think the box does

17:31.751 --> 17:34.719
well, we think the box does
matter, and we think the box has

17:34.721 --> 17:36.087
matter, and we think the box has
more than one deck in it.

17:36.089 --> 17:37.155
More than one deck in it.
Let's put it that way.

17:37.157 --> 17:39.057
Let's put it that way.
And we also think that one

17:39.059 --> 17:40.691
and we also think that one
of the big secrets is how

17:40.693 --> 17:42.560
of the big secrets is how
good you are at sleight of hand.

17:42.562 --> 17:43.528
Good you are at sleight of hand.
>> I'm going to ask you this

17:43.530 --> 17:44.395
>> I'm going to ask you this
question, then, 'cause if I've

17:44.397 --> 17:45.096
question, then, 'cause if I've
understood correctly,

17:45.098 --> 17:46.164
understood correctly,
you're saying that he's using

17:46.166 --> 17:47.532
you're saying that he's using
more than one deck out here.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.500
More than one deck out here.
>> There's other stuff in

17:49.502 --> 17:50.501
>> there's other stuff in
the box besides the one deck

17:50.503 --> 17:51.369
the box besides the one deck
of cards.

17:51.371 --> 17:52.604
Of cards.
>> Okay, I can tell you--

17:52.605 --> 17:53.838
>> okay, I can tell you--
>> can I show?

17:59.812 --> 18:05.083
[Laughter]

18:06.418 --> 18:08.820

He was ready for that,

18:08.822 --> 18:09.620
he was ready for that,
wasn't he?

18:09.622 --> 18:10.488
Wasn't he?
Hold on.

18:10.490 --> 18:11.522
Hold on.
He wants to know more.

18:11.524 --> 18:14.525
He wants to know more.
>> There is one other

18:14.527 --> 18:15.560
>> there is one other
possibility:

18:15.562 --> 18:18.096
Possibility:
You fooled us.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.831
You fooled us.
>> Yeah! Come on!

illusion, and it's pretty
special 'cause Sam built it

20:31.231 --> 20:31.829
To be here this evening.
But first of all,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.364
but first of all,
I should explain, the problem

20:33.366 --> 20:34.865
I should explain, the problem
with our act is that we are,

20:34.867 --> 20:36.901
with our act is that we are,
of course, two guys,

20:36.903 --> 20:38.369
of course, two guys,
and any great illusion act

20:38.371 --> 20:39.904
and any great illusion act
should contain a glamorous

20:39.906 --> 20:41.639
should contain a glamorous
magic assistant.

20:41.641 --> 20:42.640
Magic assistant.
No offense intended,

20:42.642 --> 20:44.242
no offense intended,
penn and teller.

20:44.244 --> 20:45.810
Penn and teller.
So Richard and I flipped

20:45.812 --> 20:47.745
so Richard and I flipped
this coin backstage and,

20:47.747 --> 20:48.846
this coin backstage and,
unfortunately, Richard lost,

20:48.848 --> 20:49.981
unfortunately, Richard lost,
so...

20:49.983 --> 20:50.748
So...
>> Could I have a look

20:50.749 --> 20:51.514
>> could I have a look
at that coin?

20:51.517 --> 20:52.483
At that coin?
>> Sadly, there isn't time,

20:52.485 --> 20:53.651
>> sadly, there isn't time,
Richard, 'cause you now have

20:53.653 --> 20:54.552
Richard, 'cause you now have
to talk the audience

20:54.554 --> 20:56.587
to talk the audience
through the spectacular mystery

20:56.589 --> 20:58.489
through the spectacular mystery
trunk illusion.

20:58.491 --> 20:59.523
Trunk illusion.
>> The spectacular mystery

20:59.525 --> 21:01.559
>> the spectacular mystery
trunk illusion is a box,

21:01.561 --> 21:02.827
trunk illusion is a box,
which Sam built earlier this

21:02.829 --> 21:03.494
which Sam built earlier this
week.

21:03.496 --> 21:04.662
Week.
>> It is crafted out of the

21:04.664 --> 21:06.330
>> it is crafted out of the
finest English oak...

21:06.332 --> 21:07.398
Finest English oak...
>> Which makes it ridiculously

21:07.400 --> 21:07.865
>> which makes it ridiculously
heavy.

21:07.867 --> 21:09.500
Heavy.
>> It has a domed lid...

21:09.502 --> 21:10.401
>> It has a domed lid...
>> Which was time-consuming

21:10.403 --> 21:11.569
>> which was time-consuming
and unnecessary.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.504
And unnecessary.
>> And also, two coats

21:13.506 --> 21:16.307
>> and also, two coats
of high-quality gloss.

21:16.309 --> 21:17.475
Of high-quality gloss.
>> Yeah.

21:17.477 --> 21:19.510
>> Yeah.
Clearly, two coats of gloss.

21:19.512 --> 21:20.444
Clearly, two coats of gloss.
Now, what you're about to

21:20.446 --> 21:22.480
now, what you're about to
witness is a feat of escapology.

21:22.482 --> 21:23.614
Witness is a feat of escapology.
I've been training hard,

21:23.616 --> 21:24.649
I've been training hard,
and to be a world-class

21:24.651 --> 21:25.449
and to be a world-class
escapologist,

21:25.451 --> 21:26.450
escapologist,
you need a few things:

21:26.452 --> 21:29.487
You need a few things:
Strength, determination, focus,

21:29.489 --> 21:30.721
strength, determination, focus,
and most importantly--

21:30.723 --> 21:31.455
and most importantly--
>> you need a box!

21:31.457 --> 21:32.790
>> You need a box!
You need a box,

21:32.792 --> 21:35.426
you need a box,
and we have a box.

21:35.428 --> 21:36.460
And we have a box.
Now, historically,

21:36.462 --> 21:37.495
now, historically,
escapologists would place

21:37.497 --> 21:39.730
escapologists would place
the box on top of a roll of

21:39.732 --> 21:41.365
the box on top of a roll of
carpet.

21:41.367 --> 21:42.300
Carpet.
>> So tonight we will put

21:42.302 --> 21:44.001
>> so tonight we will put
Sam's brand-new box on top

21:44.003 --> 21:47.505
Sam's brand-new box on top
of a brand-new roll of carpet.

21:47.507 --> 21:48.306
Of a brand-new roll of carpet.
>> Lino!

21:48.308 --> 21:49.774
>> Lino!
A roll of lino,

21:49.776 --> 21:51.075
a roll of lino,
because we couldn't afford

21:51.077 --> 21:52.576
because we couldn't afford
the carpet today, so...

21:52.578 --> 21:54.512
The carpet today, so...
>> Why can't we afford carpet?

21:54.514 --> 21:56.881
>> Why can't we afford carpet?
>> Well, that's solid oak.

21:56.883 --> 21:57.782
>> Well, that's solid oak.
>> Brilliant.

21:57.784 --> 21:58.449
>> Brilliant.
Lino.

21:58.451 --> 21:59.350
Lino.
We'll put it on top of a

21:59.352 --> 22:00.084
we'll put it on top of a
roll of lino then.

22:00.086 --> 22:04.055
Roll of lino then.
Now, also, inside of this box,

22:04.057 --> 22:05.556
now, also, inside of this box,
there is a bag.

22:05.558 --> 22:06.857
There is a bag.
The bag will make my escape

22:06.859 --> 22:08.326
the bag will make my escape
even more difficult because,

22:08.328 --> 22:09.460
even more difficult because,
when I'm tied inside of it,

22:09.462 --> 22:10.561
when I'm tied inside of it,
I will have no access to the

22:10.563 --> 22:12.096
I will have no access to the
lid, to the lock,

22:12.098 --> 22:12.930
lid, to the lock,
or to the hinges.

22:12.932 --> 22:13.798
Or to the hinges.
So this is it:

22:13.800 --> 22:14.965
So this is it:
My big moment, live,

22:14.967 --> 22:16.500
my big moment, live,
in this studio,

22:16.502 --> 22:18.069
in this studio,
in high definition...

22:18.071 --> 22:19.437
In high definition...
>> In a tutu.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.339
>> In a tutu.
[Laughter]

22:21.341 --> 22:22.106
[Laughter]
So, Mr. young,

22:22.108 --> 22:22.973
so, Mr. young,
if you could climb into the bag

22:22.975 --> 22:23.641
if you could climb into the bag
now, please,

22:23.643 --> 22:27.478
now, please,
with style and panache.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.779
With style and panache.
[Laughter]

22:28.781 --> 22:29.547
[Laughter]
Okay, then,

22:29.549 --> 22:31.482
okay, then,
just climb into the bag.

22:31.484 --> 22:33.050
Just climb into the bag.
I will now tie Richard young

22:33.052 --> 22:34.418
I will now tie Richard young
inside of the bag,

22:34.420 --> 22:35.519
inside of the bag,
and I will secure the bag in

22:35.521 --> 22:37.788
and I will secure the bag in
place with the lid.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.924
Place with the lid.
I will secure the lid shut

22:39.926 --> 22:41.926
I will secure the lid shut
with this padlock.

22:44.429 --> 22:46.797
Everything is now in place
for Richard to try and

22:46.799 --> 22:47.965
for Richard to try and
escape from the trunk,

22:47.967 --> 22:49.133
escape from the trunk,
beating his own personal

22:49.135 --> 22:50.668
beating his own personal
best record live in front of

22:50.670 --> 22:52.036
best record live in front of
you, which is just under

22:52.038 --> 22:53.137
you, which is just under
three hours, I think.

22:53.139 --> 22:54.004
Three hours, I think.
[Laughter]

22:54.006 --> 22:55.639
[Laughter]
>> 2:51!

22:55.641 --> 22:56.741
>> 2:51!
>> I'm sorry.

22:56.743 --> 22:58.075
>> I'm sorry.
It's two hours and 51.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.710
It's two hours and 51.
So all I need now is a flag

22:59.712 --> 23:00.745
so all I need now is a flag
and some cheesy music,

23:00.747 --> 23:01.612
and some cheesy music,
please.

23:01.614 --> 23:02.146
Please.
Thank you.

24:27.232 --> 24:29.233
Thank you.

24:31.102 --> 24:33.971

I tell you, I miss it.

24:33.973 --> 24:34.772
I tell you, I miss it.
That was great, Mr. young.

24:34.773 --> 24:35.572
That was great, Mr. young.
Which one's young?

24:35.575 --> 24:36.106
Which one's young?
Which one's strange?

24:36.108 --> 24:36.774
Which one's strange?
>> Young.

24:36.776 --> 24:37.808
>> Young.
>> Young and strange.

24:37.810 --> 24:38.676
>> Young and strange.
Penn and teller,

24:38.678 --> 24:39.610
penn and teller,
who are kind of old and weird,

24:39.612 --> 24:40.578
who are kind of old and weird,
I guess.

24:40.580 --> 24:42.046
I guess.
[Laughter]

24:42.048 --> 24:43.047
[Laughter]
I've got a vantage point

24:43.049 --> 24:43.714
I've got a vantage point
over there,

24:43.716 --> 24:44.682
over there,
so I can see the act,

24:44.684 --> 24:45.650
so I can see the act,
but I can also see their faces,

24:45.651 --> 24:46.617
but I can also see their faces,
and they did look genuinely

24:46.619 --> 24:48.252
and they did look genuinely
baffled at one stage there,

24:48.254 --> 24:49.587
baffled at one stage there,
so I think you've had more

24:49.589 --> 24:50.588
so I think you've had more
than enough time.

24:50.590 --> 24:51.622
Than enough time.
It was a great act to start

24:51.624 --> 24:52.089
it was a great act to start
with.

24:52.091 --> 24:52.923
With.
I think you'll agree.

24:52.924 --> 24:53.756
I think you'll agree.
>> It's a great act,

24:53.759 --> 24:55.860
>> it's a great act,
and I will pay you back for

24:55.862 --> 24:57.127
and I will pay you back for
the old and weird comment.

24:57.129 --> 24:58.762
The old and weird comment.
[Laughter]

24:58.764 --> 25:00.731
[Laughter]
You know that we have a soft

25:00.733 --> 25:02.733
you know that we have a soft
spot in our heart for double

25:02.735 --> 25:04.768
spot in our heart for double
acts, and this was great.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.637
Acts, and this was great.
I think it was about the time

25:06.639 --> 25:08.239
I think it was about the time
you pulled out the flag,

25:08.241 --> 25:09.840
you pulled out the flag,
teller said,

25:09.842 --> 25:11.809
teller said,
"real girl in the box.

25:11.811 --> 25:14.178
"Real girl in the box.
He'll be in the back."

25:14.180 --> 25:15.813
He'll be in the back."
So once we heard that,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.682
so once we heard that,
all we have to check, really--

25:18.684 --> 25:20.184
all we have to check, really--
you do not have trapdoors.

25:20.186 --> 25:22.286
You do not have trapdoors.
I will tell everybody here.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.687
I will tell everybody here.
And I will say it's a brilliant

25:23.689 --> 25:25.789
and I will say it's a brilliant
use of the choreography

25:25.791 --> 25:28.993
use of the choreography
of your ampersand screen here.

25:28.995 --> 25:30.227
Of your ampersand screen here.
Let me just ask you:

25:30.229 --> 25:31.562
Let me just ask you:
You're a team.

25:31.564 --> 25:32.096
You're a team.
We're a team.

25:32.098 --> 25:35.032
We're a team.
If we knew every single move

25:35.034 --> 25:36.100
if we knew every single move
that you made

25:36.102 --> 25:38.202
that you made
and every single prop,

25:38.204 --> 25:39.703
and every single prop,
would we--

25:39.705 --> 25:40.905
would we--
if we knew everything--

25:40.907 --> 25:43.173
if we knew everything--
would we be able to do that act?

25:43.175 --> 25:43.958
Would we be able to do that act?
>> Thanks for your time.

25:43.959 --> 25:44.742
>> Thanks for your time.
>> Yeah, thanks very much

25:44.744 --> 25:45.209
>> yeah, thanks very much
for your time.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.277
For your time.
[Laughter]

25:46.279 --> 25:47.056
[Laughter]
>> Okay, that's great.

25:47.057 --> 25:47.834
>> Okay, that's great.
I don't think we need to know

25:47.835 --> 25:48.612
I don't think we need to know
any more.

25:48.614 --> 25:50.581
Any more.
>> You two are such fabulous

25:50.583 --> 25:52.783

and welcome back to <i> fool us,</i>
and it's time for us to meet

26:22.715 --> 26:24.715
and it's time for us to meet
our next magician.

26:29.254 --> 26:32.356
>> My name is Daniel Madison.
The style of sleight of hand

26:32.358 --> 26:33.657
the style of sleight of hand
that I do is based on card

26:33.659 --> 26:34.925
that I do is based on card
cheating.

26:34.927 --> 26:36.293
Cheating.
I'm more interested in the

26:36.295 --> 26:38.062
I'm more interested in the
techniques and the methods

26:38.064 --> 26:39.163
techniques and the methods
and the psychology behind

26:39.165 --> 26:40.230
and the psychology behind
the deception,

26:40.232 --> 26:41.365
the deception,
whereas the magician is usually

26:41.367 --> 26:42.666
whereas the magician is usually
more interested in trying to

26:42.668 --> 26:44.168
more interested in trying to
fool somebody.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.736
Fool somebody.
The thing I love most about

26:45.738 --> 26:46.937
the thing I love most about
handling a deck of cards is

26:46.939 --> 26:47.805
handling a deck of cards is
the control.

26:47.807 --> 26:50.274
The control.
It's something of an obsession.

26:50.276 --> 26:51.609
It's something of an obsession.
If I did manage to fool

26:51.611 --> 26:52.343
if I did manage to fool
penn and teller,

26:52.345 --> 26:53.811
penn and teller,
although I'd be taken to Vegas,

26:53.813 --> 26:55.245
although I'd be taken to Vegas,
I might have to spend my whole

26:55.247 --> 26:56.347
I might have to spend my whole
time in the hotel room,

26:56.349 --> 26:57.181
time in the hotel room,
'cause I don't think the

26:57.183 --> 26:59.183
'cause I don't think the
casinos would let me in.

27:00.952 --> 27:03.988
[Cheers and applause]
>> Will you please welcome

27:03.990 --> 27:06.156

Daniel Madison?

27:06.158 --> 27:09.159
Daniel Madison?
[Cheers and applause]

27:14.199 --> 27:18.302
>> June 14, 1930.
There was a card cheat

27:18.304 --> 27:20.204
there was a card cheat
called Walter Irving Scott.

27:20.206 --> 27:21.305
Called Walter Irving Scott.
He managed to fool some of

27:21.307 --> 27:22.239
he managed to fool some of
the world's most amazing

27:22.241 --> 27:24.308
the world's most amazing
magicians by demonstrating

27:24.310 --> 27:26.777
magicians by demonstrating
an ability to deal winning

27:26.779 --> 27:28.045
an ability to deal winning
poker hands from a shuffled

27:28.047 --> 27:29.380
poker hands from a shuffled
deck of cards.

27:29.382 --> 27:32.349
Deck of cards.
And he did this blindfolded.

27:32.351 --> 27:33.684
And he did this blindfolded.
A lot of speculation

27:33.686 --> 27:34.918
a lot of speculation
followed these stories

27:34.920 --> 27:36.086
followed these stories
as to whether the deck that he

27:36.088 --> 27:38.856
as to whether the deck that he
used was borrowed or his own.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.991
Used was borrowed or his own.
Any magician can deal aces

27:40.993 --> 27:42.026
any magician can deal aces
or a winning poker hand from

27:42.028 --> 27:43.894
or a winning poker hand from
his own deck.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.996
His own deck.
Tonight, I'm going to attempt

27:45.998 --> 27:47.798
tonight, I'm going to attempt
to deal a winning poker hand

27:47.800 --> 27:49.166
to deal a winning poker hand
from a deck of cards

27:49.168 --> 27:50.968
from a deck of cards
that I've never handled before,

27:50.970 --> 27:52.169
that I've never handled before,
and in honor of

27:52.171 --> 27:54.805
and in honor of
Walter Irving Scott,

27:54.807 --> 27:56.006
Walter Irving Scott,
I'm going to attempt to do it

27:56.008 --> 27:58.809
I'm going to attempt to do it
wearing a blindfold.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.678
Wearing a blindfold.
At this point, penn and teller,

28:00.680 --> 28:02.012
at this point, penn and teller,
can I invite you to join me

28:02.014 --> 28:03.380
can I invite you to join me
at the card table, please?

28:03.382 --> 28:05.082
At the card table, please?
Thank you very much.

28:05.084 --> 28:08.085
Thank you very much.
[Cheers and applause]

28:09.387 --> 28:12.823
Nice to meet you.
Nice to meet you.

28:15.093 --> 28:17.261
Can you please inspect
the blindfold,

28:17.263 --> 28:19.263
the blindfold,
make sure it's not see-through?

28:19.265 --> 28:20.164
Make sure it's not see-through?
I asked you to bring along

28:20.166 --> 28:20.931
I asked you to bring along
a deck of cards that I

28:20.933 --> 28:21.899
a deck of cards that I
can use.

28:21.901 --> 28:23.100
Can use.
Can you take the cards out

28:23.102 --> 28:24.468
can you take the cards out
of the box for me?

28:24.470 --> 28:28.205
Of the box for me?
Give them a thorough shuffle.

28:28.207 --> 28:31.875
Give them a thorough shuffle.
I'm going to put the, um--

28:31.877 --> 28:32.910
I'm going to put the, um--
the blindfold on.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.244
The blindfold on.
Are you satisfied that

28:34.246 --> 28:37.047
are you satisfied that
there's no peeking going on or--

28:38.783 --> 28:41.085
are you happy with that?
>> I'm pretty happy, yeah.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.352
>> I'm pretty happy, yeah.
>> Okay, um...

28:42.354 --> 28:45.889
>> Okay, um...
[Laughter]

28:45.891 --> 28:47.091
[Laughter]
Once you're satisfied with

28:47.093 --> 28:48.325
once you're satisfied with
the shuffled deck,

28:48.327 --> 28:49.359
the shuffled deck,
if you can put it in my hand

28:49.361 --> 28:50.761
if you can put it in my hand
facedown, please.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.763
Facedown, please.
>> Feel good about that?

28:55.200 --> 28:57.801
>> Is the deck now--
is it facedown?

28:57.803 --> 28:58.268
Is it facedown?
>> Yeah, it is.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.037
>> Yeah, it is.
>> So you can see the back

29:00.039 --> 29:01.338
>> so you can see the back
of the cards there?

29:01.340 --> 29:02.239
Of the cards there?
>> Yep.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.507
>> Yep.
>> Okay.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.409
>> Okay.
This next part I have to perform

29:05.411 --> 29:06.276
this next part I have to perform
in silence,

29:06.278 --> 29:08.278
in silence,
if you don't mind.

29:57.061 --> 30:00.330
If I've done this correctly,
the five cards that I've

30:00.332 --> 30:03.367
the five cards that I've
dealt to the table will be a

30:03.369 --> 30:05.969
dealt to the table will be a
royal flush, all diamonds,

30:05.971 --> 30:08.238
royal flush, all diamonds,
so the 10, the Jack,

30:08.240 --> 30:09.306
so the 10, the Jack,
the queen, the king,

30:09.308 --> 30:10.374
the queen, the king,
and the ace of diamonds.

30:10.376 --> 30:11.341
And the ace of diamonds.
If you can turn those cards

30:11.343 --> 30:14.178
if you can turn those cards
over for me, please.

30:14.180 --> 30:17.181
Over for me, please.
>> That is the king of diamonds.

30:17.183 --> 30:19.249
>> That is the king of diamonds.
That's the 10 of diamonds.

30:19.251 --> 30:21.952
That's the 10 of diamonds.
That's the queen of diamonds.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.021
That's the queen of diamonds.
That's the Jack of diamonds.

30:24.023 --> 30:25.522
That's the Jack of diamonds.
I think it's really,

30:25.524 --> 30:27.891
I think it's really,
really likely that that's

30:27.893 --> 30:28.826
really likely that that's
the ace of diamonds.

30:28.828 --> 30:31.829
The ace of diamonds.

[Cheers and applause]
Come on over with me.

Come on over with me.
We'll let the guys chat

30:46.378 --> 30:47.044

Over there.
You come over here.

30:48.547 --> 30:50.447
You come over here.
I want to see--

30:50.449 --> 30:52.015
I want to see--
'cause I'm now feeling--

30:52.017 --> 30:52.850
'cause I'm now feeling--
'cause I'm been watching penn

30:52.852 --> 30:53.450
'cause I'm been watching penn
and teller--I'm feeling now

30:53.452 --> 30:54.384
and teller--I'm feeling now
I know how to bust people.

30:54.386 --> 30:55.853
I know how to bust people.
I'm looking all over the place.

30:55.855 --> 30:57.020
I'm looking all over the place.
I couldn't see anything.

30:57.022 --> 30:57.955
I couldn't see anything.
I'm assuming it was something

30:57.957 --> 30:58.422
I'm assuming it was something
to do with this,

30:58.424 --> 31:00.290
to do with this,
but you can't see anything

31:00.292 --> 31:00.958
but you can't see anything
with that,

31:00.960 --> 31:01.642
with that,
so that's completely--

31:01.643 --> 31:02.325
so that's completely--
you're completely blind

31:02.328 --> 31:02.993
you're completely blind
with this.

31:02.995 --> 31:03.594
With this.

Obviously...
>> Of course.

31:06.632 --> 31:07.531
>> Of course.
>> 'Cause I can't see anything

31:07.533 --> 31:08.398
>> 'cause I can't see anything
so--

31:08.400 --> 31:09.466
so--
>> have you ever, in the past,

31:09.467 --> 31:10.533
>> have you ever, in the past,
been tempted, shall we say,

31:10.536 --> 31:11.568
been tempted, shall we say,
to use these kind of skills

31:11.570 --> 31:13.403
to use these kind of skills
in an actual poker game?

31:13.405 --> 31:14.571
In an actual poker game?
>> Not something I can really

31:14.573 --> 31:15.939
>> not something I can really
talk about.

31:15.941 --> 31:18.008
Talk about.
[Laughter]

or do you think they might

31:19.378 --> 31:20.577
or do you think they might
know what's going on?

31:20.579 --> 31:22.412
Know what's going on?
>> I won't be surprised if I

31:22.414 --> 31:23.413
>> I won't be surprised if I
haven't fooled them,

31:23.415 --> 31:24.448
haven't fooled them,
'cause I know how

31:24.450 --> 31:26.383
'cause I know how
intelligent they are.

31:26.385 --> 31:27.351
Intelligent they are.
[Laughter]

31:27.353 --> 31:29.419
[Laughter]
So, you know--

31:29.421 --> 31:30.487
so, you know--
>> despite the way they look.

31:30.489 --> 31:31.488
>> Despite the way they look.
>> You know, now that I think

31:31.490 --> 31:32.155

about it,

31:32.157 --> 31:33.523
about it,
maybe he did fool us.

Take it away.
>> Uh...Wow.

31:41.133 --> 31:42.532
>> Uh...Wow.
I think we might be more

31:42.534 --> 31:44.034
I think we might be more
impressed 'cause we know

31:44.036 --> 31:45.535
impressed 'cause we know
what you did,

31:45.537 --> 31:46.470
what you did,
but I'm just going to say to

31:46.472 --> 31:48.438
but I'm just going to say to
you that a dear friend of mine,

31:48.440 --> 31:50.173
you that a dear friend of mine,
Jerry Camaro,

31:50.175 --> 31:53.577
Jerry Camaro,
did the move that you did

31:53.579 --> 31:54.544
did the move that you did
when you were dealing out

31:54.546 --> 31:55.612
when you were dealing out
the cards,

31:55.614 --> 31:56.647
the cards,

31:56.649 --> 31:58.215
and he used to go around
teaching it to people,

31:58.217 --> 32:00.450
teaching it to people,
and his move was so perfect,

32:00.452 --> 32:02.119
and his move was so perfect,
he would teach it to magicians,

32:02.121 --> 32:03.553
he would teach it to magicians,
and they could never learn it,

32:03.555 --> 32:04.588
and they could never learn it,
and the reason they could

32:04.590 --> 32:06.056
and the reason they could
never learn it was, he had

32:06.058 --> 32:09.226
never learn it was, he had
spent 14 years in prison for

32:09.228 --> 32:10.160

murder one

32:10.162 --> 32:12.129

and practiced every day.

32:12.131 --> 32:13.130
And practiced every day.
>> Right.

32:13.132 --> 32:15.399
>> Right.
>> I have never seen anyone

32:15.401 --> 32:17.401
>> I have never seen anyone
who did not do hard time in

32:17.403 --> 32:19.503

prison do that move you did

32:19.505 --> 32:21.538

to pull those out that well.

32:21.540 --> 32:23.440
To pull those out that well.

flush of diamonds from the
shuffled deck onto the table

to that move,

32:29.982 --> 32:31.148
to that move,
but I've never seen someone

32:31.150 --> 32:31.615
but I've never seen someone
do it better.

card tricks,
and that is, card tricks seem

33:44.256 --> 33:48.792
and that is, card tricks seem
to us to be intrinsically wimpy.

33:48.794 --> 33:50.027
To us to be intrinsically wimpy.
We got a card trick that

33:50.029 --> 33:51.528
we got a card trick that
changes that up a little bit,

33:51.530 --> 33:52.729
changes that up a little bit,
and it starts like every other

33:52.731 --> 33:53.463
and it starts like every other
card trick:

33:53.465 --> 33:56.700
Card trick:
With a card being selected.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.102
With a card being selected.
And how about you,

33:59.104 --> 34:02.039

34:05.544 --> 34:06.810
down the deck,
and while he's riffling,

34:06.812 --> 34:08.745
and while he's riffling,
you just yell, "yo" or "stop"

34:08.746 --> 34:10.380

or whatever people say in

34:10.382 --> 34:11.681
or whatever people say in
england.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.616
England.
So you're just gonna riffle

34:12.618 --> 34:13.283
so you're just gonna riffle
right out there.

34:13.284 --> 34:14.684
Right out there.
Just yell it out.

34:14.686 --> 34:15.351
Just yell it out.

34:15.353 --> 34:16.219
>> Stop.
>> Okay.

34:16.221 --> 34:16.820

now, that's the card you
selected.

34:17.422 --> 34:18.221
Selected.
Would you all look at it?

34:18.223 --> 34:20.123
Would you all look at it?
And now teller will lose that

34:20.125 --> 34:22.559
and now teller will lose that
card--lose that card

34:22.561 --> 34:23.592
card--lose that card
in the deck.

34:23.594 --> 34:24.428
In the deck.
Nicely done.

American silver dollars,
not worth very much,

34:32.603 --> 34:34.838
not worth very much,
but they are still totally

34:34.840 --> 34:36.106
but they are still totally
opaque.

34:36.108 --> 34:37.107
Opaque.
I'm going to put this--

34:37.109 --> 34:37.741
I'm going to put this--

Adhesive tape there.
Your elbow was out

34:43.181 --> 34:44.547
your elbow was out
like a foot.

34:44.550 --> 34:46.216
Like a foot.

Wish I were sitting there

34:51.672 --> 34:52.255

34:52.257 --> 34:53.723
When you did that.
[Clucks like a chicken]

34:53.725 --> 34:54.391
[Clucks like a chicken]

That.
I think everybody saw it.

35:01.266 --> 35:02.766
I think everybody saw it.
What?

35:02.768 --> 35:04.267
What?
Well?

35:04.269 --> 35:05.368
Well?
Excuse me, ma'am,

35:05.370 --> 35:06.403
excuse me, ma'am,
who picked the card.

35:06.405 --> 35:07.604
Who picked the card.
Do you think the card you've

35:07.606 --> 35:09.172
do you think the card you've
selected now is lost in the

35:09.174 --> 35:10.640
selected now is lost in the
deck?

35:10.642 --> 35:12.375
Deck?
>> Yes.

35:12.377 --> 35:15.378

what I'm wearing right now,

35:20.185 --> 35:21.785
what I'm wearing right now,
it's a costume.

35:21.787 --> 35:23.253
It's a costume.
It's wardrobe, okay?

35:23.255 --> 35:23.854
It's wardrobe, okay?
So I've got nothing in the

35:23.856 --> 35:25.222
so I've got nothing in the
pockets except stuff to make

35:25.224 --> 35:26.123
pockets except stuff to make
the tricks work,

35:26.125 --> 35:27.390
the tricks work,
but backstage

35:27.392 --> 35:28.658
but backstage
in my dressing room,

35:28.660 --> 35:30.127
in my dressing room,
I'm sure I have,

35:30.129 --> 35:31.495
I'm sure I have,
in my street clothes,

35:31.497 --> 35:33.463
in my street clothes,
have at least 100 bucks--

35:33.465 --> 35:36.299
have at least 100 bucks--
100 pounds--in cash.

35:36.301 --> 35:37.300
100 pounds--in cash.
Would you be willing right

35:37.302 --> 35:41.638
would you be willing right
now to bet me 100 pounds of

35:41.640 --> 35:43.874
now to bet me 100 pounds of
your own money that teller

35:43.876 --> 35:45.475
your own money that teller
has no idea where that card

35:45.477 --> 35:46.409
has no idea where that card
is in the deck?

35:46.411 --> 35:47.144
Is in the deck?
>> No.

35:47.146 --> 35:48.178
>> No.
>> Beg pardon?

35:48.180 --> 35:49.146
>> Beg pardon?
>> No.

35:49.148 --> 35:52.582
>> No.
[Laughter]

35:52.584 --> 35:55.252
[Laughter]
>> In other words, ma'am,

35:55.254 --> 35:59.322
>> in other words, ma'am,
this...

35:59.324 --> 36:00.157
This...
Isn't going to surprise

36:00.159 --> 36:01.925
isn't going to surprise
you very much, is it?

36:01.927 --> 36:02.626
You very much, is it?
No.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.194
No.
So the instant that teller

36:04.196 --> 36:06.596
so the instant that teller
did that horrendous move,

36:06.598 --> 36:08.165
did that horrendous move,
you knew the card wasn't

36:08.167 --> 36:09.799
you knew the card wasn't
lost in the deck, right?

36:09.801 --> 36:11.368
Lost in the deck, right?
And yet, when I looked you

36:11.370 --> 36:14.271
and yet, when I looked you
in the eye and asked you,

36:14.273 --> 36:16.373
in the eye and asked you,
human being to human being,

36:16.375 --> 36:19.743
human being to human being,
"is the card lost in the deck?"

36:19.745 --> 36:22.579
"Is the card lost in the deck?"
You responded, "yes."

36:22.581 --> 36:24.314
You responded, "yes."
And it really wasn't until

36:24.316 --> 36:26.550
and it really wasn't until
hard, cold cash entered

36:26.552 --> 36:28.518
hard, cold cash entered
the picture that you backed down

36:28.520 --> 36:29.953
the picture that you backed down
at all, is that right?

36:29.955 --> 36:32.222
At all, is that right?
Now, a lot of people wonder

36:32.224 --> 36:35.392
now, a lot of people wonder
why magic works.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.893
Why magic works.
And the answer?

36:36.895 --> 36:39.262
And the answer?
Sitting right there wearing red!

36:39.264 --> 36:40.530
Sitting right there wearing red!
[Laughter]

36:40.532 --> 36:43.266
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]

36:43.268 --> 36:44.067
[Cheers and applause]
Now, I want to stick up for

36:44.068 --> 36:44.867
now, I want to stick up for
her a little bit, okay?

36:44.870 --> 36:46.836
Her a little bit, okay?
This is not a moral issue.

36:46.838 --> 36:49.206
This is not a moral issue.
I feel certain that if teller

36:49.208 --> 36:49.806
I feel certain that if teller
had been, you know,

36:49.808 --> 36:51.942
had been, you know,
chain sawing a puppy,

36:51.944 --> 36:53.110
chain sawing a puppy,
you would have at least

36:53.111 --> 36:54.277
you would have at least
raised your hand and maybe

36:54.279 --> 36:55.679
raised your hand and maybe
cleared your throat, right?

36:55.681 --> 36:56.546
Cleared your throat, right?
[Laughter]

36:56.548 --> 36:57.647
[Laughter]
It's just a card trick.

36:57.649 --> 36:58.615
It's just a card trick.
You don't care at all.

36:58.617 --> 36:59.482
You don't care at all.
So I'm going to take that

36:59.484 --> 37:00.850
so I'm going to take that
card you selected,

37:00.852 --> 37:02.752
card you selected,
now I'll cut it into the deck,

37:02.754 --> 37:03.787
now I'll cut it into the deck,
then I'll give the cards

37:03.789 --> 37:04.654
then I'll give the cards
a shuffle,

37:04.656 --> 37:06.389
a shuffle,
and now that card is lost in

37:06.391 --> 37:07.591
and now that card is lost in
the deck, right?

37:07.593 --> 37:08.658
The deck, right?
Of course not!

37:08.660 --> 37:10.427
Of course not!
Use your head!

37:10.429 --> 37:11.394
Use your head!
[Laughter]

37:11.396 --> 37:13.997
[Laughter]
No matter how nice and sincere

37:13.999 --> 37:15.865
no matter how nice and sincere
I pretend to be to you

37:15.867 --> 37:17.434
I pretend to be to you
and how mean I pretend to be

37:17.436 --> 37:19.402
and how mean I pretend to be
to this--pretend to be to this

37:19.404 --> 37:21.738
to this--pretend to be to this
man here, my first allegiance in

37:21.740 --> 37:24.274
man here, my first allegiance in
the world is to my partner,

37:24.276 --> 37:25.642
the world is to my partner,
and if he wants the card on

37:25.644 --> 37:29.946
and if he wants the card on
top, that card stays on top.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.381
Top, that card stays on top.
We could do this whole thing

37:31.383 --> 37:33.383
we could do this whole thing
again smooth, huh?

37:33.385 --> 37:35.285
Again smooth, huh?
Do this whole thing again.

37:35.287 --> 37:35.986
Do this whole thing again.
I'm just going to riffle

37:35.988 --> 37:36.653
I'm just going to riffle
down the deck,

37:36.655 --> 37:37.587
down the deck,
and once again, you just say,

37:37.589 --> 37:39.256
and once again, you just say,
"stop."

37:39.258 --> 37:39.723
"Stop."
>> Stop.

37:39.725 --> 37:40.390
>> Stop.
>> Okay, right there

37:40.392 --> 37:41.258
>> okay, right there
near the middle?

37:41.260 --> 37:41.858
Near the middle?
That's the card we're going

37:41.860 --> 37:42.559
that's the card we're going
to use.

37:42.561 --> 37:43.660
To use.
Now that's the card we should

37:43.662 --> 37:44.461
now that's the card we should
really remember.

37:44.463 --> 37:45.762
Really remember.
Forget about that other one.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.797
Forget about that other one.
Now I'll do another false cut

37:47.799 --> 37:49.699
now I'll do another false cut
and a false shuffle,

37:49.701 --> 37:51.401
and a false shuffle,
and the card is ostensibly

37:51.403 --> 37:53.403
and the card is ostensibly
lost in the deck, right?

37:53.405 --> 37:55.038
Lost in the deck, right?
And now I'm just going to--

37:55.040 --> 37:56.840
and now I'm just going to--
I'm going to take the coins

37:56.842 --> 37:57.507
I'm going to take the coins
here.

37:57.509 --> 38:01.311
Here.
I put one on his upstage eye

38:01.313 --> 38:05.448
I put one on his upstage eye
and one on his downstage eye

38:05.450 --> 38:07.317
and one on his downstage eye
and one more right across

38:07.319 --> 38:09.919
and one more right across
the middle to stick it

38:09.921 --> 38:12.322
the middle to stick it
to his greasy, little head.

38:12.324 --> 38:13.823
To his greasy, little head.
There we go.

38:13.825 --> 38:14.724
There we go.
Now, ma'am,

38:14.726 --> 38:15.725
now, ma'am,
do you know about shuffling

38:15.727 --> 38:17.060
do you know about shuffling
a deck of cards and everything?

38:17.062 --> 38:18.028
A deck of cards and everything?
Just take the cards,

38:18.030 --> 38:19.029
just take the cards,
find the card that was

38:19.030 --> 38:20.029
find the card that was
selected, look through,

38:20.032 --> 38:20.731
selected, look through,
and then just lose it

38:20.732 --> 38:21.431
and then just lose it
in the deck.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.299
In the deck.
Just look through,

38:22.301 --> 38:23.033
just look through,
shuffle it.

38:23.035 --> 38:23.933
Shuffle it.
Make sure it's lost in the

38:23.935 --> 38:24.618
make sure it's lost in the
deck, would you, please,

38:24.619 --> 38:25.302
deck, would you, please,
ma'am?

38:25.304 --> 38:26.403
Ma'am?
Just shuffle it right in there.

38:26.405 --> 38:28.038
Just shuffle it right in there.
Make sure it's lost there.

38:28.040 --> 38:29.673
Make sure it's lost there.
[Laughter]

38:29.675 --> 38:30.640
[Laughter]
Excuse me, ma'am?

38:30.642 --> 38:31.308
Excuse me, ma'am?
Yo, ma'am? Ma'am!

38:31.310 --> 38:31.975
Yo, ma'am? Ma'am!
>> Yeah?

38:31.977 --> 38:32.676
>> Yeah?
>> Yo, yeah.

38:32.678 --> 38:34.811
>> Yo, yeah.
[Laughter]

38:34.813 --> 38:37.814
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]

38:39.684 --> 38:42.385
Let me explain something
to you, ma'am:

38:42.387 --> 38:43.920
To you, ma'am:
Your only sin,

38:43.922 --> 38:45.388
your only sin,
if it can be called a sin,

38:45.390 --> 38:46.323
if it can be called a sin,
is you're a very nice,

38:46.325 --> 38:47.390
is you're a very nice,
polite woman.

38:47.392 --> 38:48.325
Polite woman.
So I'm talking to you--

38:48.327 --> 38:48.825
so I'm talking to you--
see what you're doing?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.060
See what you're doing?
You're looking me right in

38:50.062 --> 38:50.994
you're looking me right in
the eyes,

38:50.996 --> 38:52.529
the eyes,
and that's the way you should

38:52.531 --> 38:54.431
and that's the way you should
always deal with another

38:54.433 --> 38:55.031
always deal with another
human being.

38:55.033 --> 38:56.499
Human being.
But when you're dealing with

38:56.501 --> 38:58.468
but when you're dealing with
a scum ball like me...

38:58.470 --> 38:58.935
A scum ball like me...
[Laughter]

38:58.937 --> 39:00.470
[Laughter]
Keep your eyes on my hands.

39:00.472 --> 39:01.138
Keep your eyes on my hands.
All I did was, while you were

39:01.139 --> 39:01.805
all I did was, while you were
looking in my eyes,

39:01.807 --> 39:03.373
looking in my eyes,
I just levered the top card

39:03.375 --> 39:05.041
I just levered the top card
off, pushed it in my palm,

39:05.043 --> 39:06.676
off, pushed it in my palm,
then I handed you the deck

39:06.678 --> 39:08.945
then I handed you the deck
with the same hand.

39:08.947 --> 39:10.880
With the same hand.
Now, you were checking out

39:10.882 --> 39:11.948
now, you were checking out
this hand,

39:11.950 --> 39:14.551
this hand,
and that's why only a putz

39:14.553 --> 39:16.486
and that's why only a putz
would palm with this hand.

39:16.488 --> 39:17.520
Would palm with this hand.
I hand you the deck with

39:17.522 --> 39:18.621
I hand you the deck with
the same hand.

39:18.623 --> 39:19.356
The same hand.
Take it.

39:19.358 --> 39:20.090
Take it.
Now watch this.

39:20.092 --> 39:20.757
Now watch this.
Watch this.

39:20.759 --> 39:21.958
Watch this.
I bring this hand out

39:21.960 --> 39:23.760
I bring this hand out
and show you that hand empty,

39:23.762 --> 39:25.628
and show you that hand empty,
because this hand looks like

39:25.630 --> 39:26.996
because this hand looks like
the seal boy.

39:26.998 --> 39:28.898
The seal boy.
I could park a buick behind

39:28.900 --> 39:30.033
I could park a buick behind
that hand, okay?

39:30.035 --> 39:31.434
That hand, okay?
So I'm just going to actually

39:31.436 --> 39:33.103
so I'm just going to actually
give you this card right here,

39:33.105 --> 39:34.437
give you this card right here,
the one that was selected,

39:34.439 --> 39:35.538
the one that was selected,
and now, really do--

39:35.540 --> 39:36.973
and now, really do--
really do lose it in the deck.

39:36.975 --> 39:37.874
Really do lose it in the deck.
Shuffle it right in there.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.676
Shuffle it right in there.
>> Penn!

39:39.678 --> 39:40.744
>> Penn!
[Laughter]

39:40.746 --> 39:41.778
[Laughter]
>> Yeah, now it's lost it in the

39:41.780 --> 39:42.545
>> yeah, now it's lost it in the
deck.

39:42.547 --> 39:43.947
Deck.
>> Shut up!

39:43.949 --> 39:45.815
>> Shut up!
[Murmurs]

39:45.817 --> 39:47.817
[Murmurs]
>> Cool.

39:53.891 --> 39:56.393
Here's your cards, Mr. teller.

39:57.862 --> 39:59.963
[Laughter]
Where'd they go?

39:59.965 --> 40:00.930
Where'd they go?
Where'd they go?

40:00.932 --> 40:02.432
Where'd they go?
[Laughter]

40:02.434 --> 40:03.066
[Laughter]
Oh, you want them?

40:03.068 --> 40:04.434
Oh, you want them?
You want them?

40:04.436 --> 40:06.436
You want them?
[Laughter]

40:08.439 --> 40:11.841
A blindfold,
opaque silver dollars,

40:11.843 --> 40:12.609
opaque silver dollars,
adhesive tape.

40:12.611 --> 40:15.478
Adhesive tape.
Teller cannot see at all.

40:15.480 --> 40:16.546
Teller cannot see at all.
[Laughs]

40:16.548 --> 40:17.514
[Laughs]
Right down here, you're peeking.

40:17.516 --> 40:18.715
Right down here, you're peeking.
Right down here by your nose,

40:18.717 --> 40:19.582
right down here by your nose,
you can see?

40:19.584 --> 40:20.450
You can see?
Hello! Hello!

40:20.452 --> 40:21.451
Hello! Hello!
[Laughs]

40:21.453 --> 40:22.552
[Laughs]
Just move these around--

40:22.554 --> 40:24.087
just move these around--
[Shouts]

40:24.089 --> 40:26.156
[Shouts]
Okay, way not cool, man.

40:26.158 --> 40:27.590
Okay, way not cool, man.
Way not cool.

40:27.592 --> 40:28.925
Way not cool.
Wait till I get it all set up.

40:28.927 --> 40:29.592
Wait till I get it all set up.
Now you go.

40:29.594 --> 40:30.460
Now you go.
Now you go.

40:30.462 --> 40:30.927
Now you go.
Now you're set.

40:30.929 --> 40:32.529
Now you're set.
Go. Pick it up. Pick it up.

40:32.530 --> 40:34.130
Go. Pick it up. Pick it up.
Is that your card?

40:34.132 --> 40:35.165
Is that your card?
The queen of hearts.

40:35.167 --> 40:36.433
The queen of hearts.
That's your card?

40:36.435 --> 40:37.434
That's your card?
[Audience murmurs]

40:37.436 --> 40:38.134
[Audience murmurs]
It really isn't?

40:38.136 --> 40:38.802
It really isn't?
No, seriously,

40:38.804 --> 40:39.803
no, seriously,
is this your card?

40:39.805 --> 40:41.471
Is this your card?
[Laughs] It really isn't?

[Laughs] It really isn't?
[Laughs]

40:42.507 --> 40:43.039
[Laughs]
Are you even going to

40:43.041 --> 40:44.574
are you even going to
remember your card--

40:44.576 --> 40:47.577
remember your card--
[Screams]

40:47.579 --> 40:50.180
[Screams]
[Cheers and applause]

40:52.149 --> 40:54.784

The 6 of clubs?

40:54.786 --> 40:55.985
The 6 of clubs?
Is that your card right there?

40:55.987 --> 40:58.154

The 6 of clubs.

The 6 of clubs.
There it is right there,

there it is right there,
the 6 of clubs right there.

41:04.930 --> 41:07.163
The 6 of clubs right there.
I just got to say one thing,

41:07.165 --> 41:08.531
I just got to say one thing,
ma'am:

41:08.533 --> 41:10.533
Ma'am:
I had to be fairly rude to you,

41:10.535 --> 41:11.868
I had to be fairly rude to you,
and I had to be kind of--

41:11.870 --> 41:12.802
and I had to be kind of--
kind of embarrass you a

41:12.804 --> 41:13.470
kind of embarrass you a
little bit,

41:13.472 --> 41:14.471
little bit,
stick the card to my forehead

41:14.473 --> 41:15.772
stick the card to my forehead
and stuff, and I have to do that

41:15.774 --> 41:18.541
and stuff, and I have to do that
to get the audience on your side

41:18.543 --> 41:19.542
to get the audience on your side
and against me,

41:19.544 --> 41:21.177
and against me,
so they'll not only accept

41:21.179 --> 41:22.779
so they'll not only accept
the knife going through my hand,

41:22.781 --> 41:23.646
the knife going through my hand,
but indeed,

41:23.648 --> 41:24.747
but indeed,
have them praying for it.

41:24.749 --> 41:27.750
Have them praying for it.
And since you were such a good

41:27.752 --> 41:28.985
and since you were such a good
sport and so pleasant--

41:28.987 --> 41:30.487
sport and so pleasant--
you can call me a sentimental

41:30.489 --> 41:31.020
you can call me a sentimental
old fool--

41:31.022 --> 41:32.822
old fool--
but I'd like you to have this.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.123
But I'd like you to have this.
[Laughter]

41:34.125 --> 41:36.726
[Laughter]
[Cheers and applause]

41:36.728 --> 41:38.495
[Cheers and applause]

41:38.497 --> 41:41.130
>> Gentlemen.
[Cheers and applause]

41:41.132 --> 41:42.265
[Cheers and applause]
I just got to say:

41:42.267 --> 41:43.933
I just got to say:
No hands or handkerchieves

41:43.935 --> 41:44.834
no hands or handkerchieves
were harmed in the making of

41:44.836 --> 41:45.502
