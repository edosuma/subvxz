- Get down!

00:05.563 --> 00:07.763
A specialist escort
agency for the very rich.

00:07.814 --> 00:09.348
Alex didn't use escorts.

00:09.400 --> 00:12.393
I have to buy a battery for my laptop.

00:12.445 --> 00:15.146
'I stole something... from the attic.'

00:15.197 --> 00:17.439
It's a locked cylinder.

00:17.491 --> 00:21.026
- It needs a code. - Which
you don't know? - No.

00:21.078 --> 00:24.238
I've gone over every
conversation, every word.

00:24.290 --> 00:28.044
Danny, you've got to figure it
out, you're the only one who can.

00:30.004 --> 00:32.705
Did you know that I
suffer from depression?!

00:32.756 --> 00:35.249
Did you know that in the past I drank?!

00:35.301 --> 00:37.584
I didn't know Alex well personally.

00:37.637 --> 00:40.879
There are not many students
who start their degree at 15.

00:40.931 --> 00:42.881
He was murdered.

00:44.060 --> 00:46.468
So I take it you want to
speak to his professor?

00:46.520 --> 00:48.011
Marcus Shore.

00:48.064 --> 00:50.305
Why did they murder him?

00:50.358 --> 00:51.974
I don't know.

00:52.026 --> 00:53.434
Whatever Alex discovered,

00:53.486 --> 00:57.563
whatever it was, whatever it
is, no-one wants in the open.

00:57.615 --> 01:00.274
We're not up against
one intelligence agency,

01:00.326 --> 01:02.901
we're up against them all.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.696
I need information.

01:05.748 --> 01:09.324
What does it mean? It
means we are quite alone.

01:09.377 --> 01:11.326
Get in the car.

01:12.129 --> 01:13.944
It's for you.

01:15.758 --> 01:17.364

06:27.820 --> 06:30.531
Well... this is weird.

06:43.711 --> 06:46.036
Never done anything like this before.

06:46.088 --> 06:47.694
Like this?

06:49.925 --> 06:51.740
What is this?

06:53.387 --> 06:55.170
Being paid

06:55.222 --> 06:57.808
to tell someone how I...

07:01.020 --> 07:03.178
.. their boyfriend.

07:07.443 --> 07:10.436
They said you wouldn't believe me.

07:10.947 --> 07:12.438
Who are they?

07:12.490 --> 07:14.304
Who are they?

07:16.786 --> 07:19.914
They are the people pulling my strings.

07:20.498 --> 07:24.043
I have no control over
what I'm about to do.

07:25.586 --> 07:27.327
Like this...

07:46.816 --> 07:48.484
No control.

07:51.821 --> 07:54.532
Alex... ate breakfast here...

07:55.992 --> 07:57.399
.. almost every morning.

07:57.451 --> 07:59.902
You can even tell me
what he liked to order?

07:59.954 --> 08:01.195
What?

08:01.247 --> 08:03.238
Oh, to be convincing, you mean?

08:03.291 --> 08:06.075
- You watched him?
- Serving.

08:06.711 --> 08:09.119
- A waiter?
- Me? No.

08:09.171 --> 08:12.216
Please. I was pretending.

08:23.644 --> 08:25.521
The service...

08:26.022 --> 08:29.400
.. it's very expensive
because the people, we...

08:31.110 --> 08:34.322
.. don't know that we are... escorts.

08:37.408 --> 08:39.702
How is that possible?

08:40.494 --> 08:42.027
We pretend.

08:42.078 --> 08:44.613
We pretend to meet them by chance,

08:44.665 --> 08:48.044
we pretend to be won
over by their charms...

08:49.712 --> 08:51.870
.. we pretend to...

08:51.922 --> 08:53.872
for pleasure...

08:53.924 --> 08:57.084
- which takes some serious pretending.
- Who pays you?

08:57.136 --> 09:00.202
Our clients aren't the people we...

09:02.016 --> 09:03.674
We report back.

09:03.726 --> 09:05.467
So and so...

09:07.229 --> 09:09.523
.. likes it like this.

09:09.982 --> 09:11.682
So and so...

09:11.734 --> 09:13.767
likes a little of this.

09:21.285 --> 09:22.891
Blackmail?

09:23.579 --> 09:25.237
But that's not my business.

09:25.289 --> 09:27.729
You just do the fucking.

09:28.626 --> 09:30.920
I just do the fucking.

09:42.932 --> 09:44.923
'They told me to meet him...

09:44.976 --> 09:46.884
'in the way you met him.'

09:46.936 --> 09:49.522
I'm sorry... 'An accident.

09:52.441 --> 09:55.152
'They told me to be like you.

09:56.612 --> 09:59.469
'They told me to act like you.'

10:00.992 --> 10:04.161
In the end, Alex wasn't so tricky.

10:05.454 --> 10:08.103
He just needed to believe...

10:08.666 --> 10:10.866
.. he was being good

10:10.918 --> 10:14.036
.. all the way up until he was being...

10:14.088 --> 10:16.111
a little bit bad.

10:18.217 --> 10:20.928
How do you seduce a good man?

10:21.804 --> 10:23.879
'My approach was simple.

10:23.931 --> 10:26.215
'I told him a sad story.'

10:26.267 --> 10:31.136
I tell him it's the will and
last testament of my mother.

10:31.188 --> 10:34.473
And my mother, she never loved me, bitch.

10:34.525 --> 10:38.143
In her will, the bitch leaves
just three things to me.

10:38.195 --> 10:41.105
Just three paintings. That's all.

10:41.157 --> 10:44.817
And Alex, listening like a puppy dog.

10:44.869 --> 10:47.653
And I tell him, heartbroken...

10:48.247 --> 10:51.573
.. they are the three
paintings I painted for her.

10:51.626 --> 10:53.742
I'm an artist, I say...

10:53.794 --> 10:57.287
No, not yet an artist,

10:57.340 --> 11:00.572
- aspiring to be.
- Pretending to be.

11:01.469 --> 11:03.419
That's a true story.

11:03.471 --> 11:05.045
I am an artist.

11:05.097 --> 11:06.422
What?

11:08.601 --> 11:12.876
What do you think? I grew
up wanting to be an escort?

11:13.856 --> 11:15.514
Enough, Danny.

11:15.566 --> 11:18.142
Enough with not believing.

11:19.028 --> 11:20.602
What do you need?

11:20.655 --> 11:22.896
I'll give it to you? Hmm?

11:22.949 --> 11:25.524
You need those little details?

11:25.576 --> 11:28.704
A birthmark on the inside of his thigh?

11:29.705 --> 11:31.947
Something whispered?

11:31.999 --> 11:34.022
Something moaned?

11:34.794 --> 11:38.026
He had a thirst, I can tell you that.

11:38.506 --> 11:41.749
Like a man crawling out of the desert.

11:41.801 --> 11:43.584
Yeah?

11:43.636 --> 11:45.169
Throat dry.

11:45.221 --> 11:46.827
Lips dry.

11:47.473 --> 11:50.466
Gulping up all those missed years.

11:54.605 --> 11:56.513
Where?

11:56.565 --> 11:58.171
My place.

11:59.777 --> 12:01.226
Your place?

12:01.279 --> 12:02.686
My fake place.

12:02.738 --> 12:05.032
Why did he come round?

12:05.700 --> 12:08.557
To see my paintings, of course.

12:13.666 --> 12:15.616
What did you do?

12:16.419 --> 12:18.452
'You hate yourself for asking.'

12:18.504 --> 12:20.496
So... 'But you had to know.'

12:20.548 --> 12:22.539
I'll be right back, OK? Give me a second.

12:22.591 --> 12:24.291
'You had to ask...

12:24.343 --> 12:26.366
'what did we do?'

12:27.722 --> 12:29.744
We played a game.

12:30.016 --> 12:33.092
How long can we talk without mentioning

12:33.144 --> 12:36.585
the only thing we were
both thinking about?

12:38.733 --> 12:41.517
The first game lasted an hour.

12:42.737 --> 12:44.822
The second game...

12:45.781 --> 12:49.222
.. lasted a little longer...

13:02.131 --> 13:04.957
I rang him afterwards,

13:05.009 --> 13:07.334
but he didn't answer.

13:07.386 --> 13:09.920
The client wanted more.

13:09.972 --> 13:13.006
But Alex wasn't interested.

13:13.059 --> 13:16.009
Why wouldn't you tell me
that he kept coming back?

13:16.062 --> 13:19.722
Because I can see you're
good at sniffing a lie.

13:19.774 --> 13:22.141
So, I told you the truth.

13:22.193 --> 13:24.476
Why did they hire you?

13:24.528 --> 13:26.520
I don't know, I don't care.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.522
It's just a job.

13:30.034 --> 13:31.640
He's dead.

13:32.578 --> 13:35.164
Your job. He was murdered.

13:36.332 --> 13:38.073
You think you're not involved?

13:38.125 --> 13:41.253
Because you seem like a loose end to me.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.250
I was told to pay for our dinner.

13:50.054 --> 13:51.389
Hey?

13:52.890 --> 13:56.300
How else are you going to let
them know what a great job you did?

13:56.352 --> 13:59.063
I can see strings on you too.

14:19.542 --> 14:21.836
What are you thinking?

14:29.051 --> 14:30.866
Say it again.

14:33.222 --> 14:35.516
What are you thinking?

14:54.076 --> 14:55.620
Nothing.

15:00.249 --> 15:02.991
You were Alex's first experience of love.

15:03.044 --> 15:06.255
If he enjoyed a second, would
you seem less important?

15:08.299 --> 15:13.054
Could the thrill of the new
replace the comfort of the old?

15:15.848 --> 15:19.007
Watergate wasn't just about
bugging the opposition.

15:19.060 --> 15:22.469
They used prostitutes to collect
information on rival candidates

15:22.521 --> 15:27.015
to shame them, manipulate
them, destroy them.

15:27.068 --> 15:30.196
Sex has always been a means of control.

15:31.113 --> 15:34.773
In the end, your
relationship became a threat

15:34.825 --> 15:37.735
to their relationship with him.

15:37.787 --> 15:40.070
He changed you, you changed him,

15:40.122 --> 15:43.073
priorities altered, loyalties altered.

15:43.125 --> 15:45.982
I noticed it in our friendship.

15:47.797 --> 15:50.508
The two of you were besotted.

15:51.175 --> 15:53.375
The rest of the world ceased to exist,

15:53.427 --> 15:56.597
but Alex was one of their
most important minds.

15:57.807 --> 16:00.935
Did you imagine they'd just
allow him to drift away?

16:02.311 --> 16:04.053
I didn't think about it.

16:04.105 --> 16:06.263
It's all THEY would've thought about.

16:06.315 --> 16:09.892
What binds this brilliant young man to us?

16:09.944 --> 16:13.072
The Queen? Our history? His parents?

16:17.285 --> 16:20.652
I accept that I didn't know
anything about his... work.

16:20.705 --> 16:22.373
His job.

16:23.916 --> 16:27.712
The truth is, I didn't really
know him as a person either.

16:30.172 --> 16:32.258
I didn't know him.

16:34.593 --> 16:38.295
Of all the attacks they've
used, including your health,

16:38.347 --> 16:42.049
the one that has proved
most effective is smut.

16:42.101 --> 16:44.468
For you, of all people.

16:46.147 --> 16:49.139
He made a mistake, that's not it.

16:49.775 --> 16:52.351
But why didn't he tell me?

16:53.029 --> 16:55.323
Some of it? Any of it?

16:56.157 --> 16:57.981
Because you wanted him to be perfect.

16:58.034 --> 17:01.026
He saw that more clearly than you.

17:03.831 --> 17:06.615
It was his funeral last week.

17:06.666 --> 17:09.492
Do you know how I found out?

17:09.545 --> 17:12.256
I heard about it on the news.

17:13.340 --> 17:18.054
He was buried at a private ceremony
for... close friends and family.

17:19.262 --> 17:21.505
I can't count how many men I've comforted

17:21.557 --> 17:23.965
when their partners were dying

17:24.018 --> 17:27.761
and the family wouldn't
allow them into the hospital,

17:27.813 --> 17:30.879
or the church where they're buried.

17:31.192 --> 17:33.225
I'm tired of it...

17:33.277 --> 17:35.853
tired of hearing about it.

17:36.697 --> 17:39.773
He wasn't close to his
parents, he was close to you.

17:39.825 --> 17:43.371
Hold your own funeral,
say your own goodbye.

17:45.373 --> 17:48.157
That's what I should be doing.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.284
Saying goodbye.

17:59.887 --> 18:02.296
What am I doing all this other stuff for?

18:02.348 --> 18:05.851
Because Alex discovered some
government secret? So what?

18:08.312 --> 18:10.637
Cos they lied about a war?

18:10.690 --> 18:14.360
They spy on us? Who..?
What's it got to do with me?

18:24.203 --> 18:27.665
And you know, I don't
know any code. I don't.

18:34.630 --> 18:36.924
'So, I don't know...'

18:37.591 --> 18:42.138
Maybe, whatever those secrets are,
maybe they weren't meant for me.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.642
Then, that's that.

19:53.334 --> 19:56.045
Do you believe in soul mates?

19:59.423 --> 20:00.675
No.

20:04.762 --> 20:07.890
Not only do I not believe in them...

20:08.307 --> 20:11.018
.. it's not even a nice idea.

20:11.602 --> 20:13.385
Not a nice idea?

20:13.437 --> 20:17.723
That there's only just one
other person out there for you.

20:17.775 --> 20:21.060
What are the odds this person
would be in the same country?

20:21.112 --> 20:22.811
Or the same city?

20:22.863 --> 20:24.521
That their paths would even cross?

20:24.573 --> 20:28.577
It would mean almost everyone in
the world is with the wrong person.

20:30.496 --> 20:33.947
If it's a way of saying, "we're
good together", why not just say...

20:34.000 --> 20:36.294
"we're good together"?

20:37.003 --> 20:38.660
But if you mean it literally...

20:38.713 --> 20:43.707
- You think there are better people
out there for you? - There might be.

20:43.759 --> 20:45.709
For both of us.

20:48.431 --> 20:51.642
But since we don't know them,
it's just a theoretical.

20:53.269 --> 20:55.010
Yes. It's...

20:55.062 --> 20:57.221
a sentimental idea.

21:00.026 --> 21:02.434
The maths doesn't add up.

21:02.486 --> 21:05.104
But...

21:05.156 --> 21:08.899
we're by the fire, we're
under a night sky.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.944
Couldn't you just have said "yes"?

21:12.121 --> 21:15.458
Is that what your soul mate would've done?

23:48.444 --> 23:50.185
Can it be opened?

23:50.237 --> 23:52.531
If you know the code.

24:10.007 --> 24:11.676
This is us.

25:04.687 --> 25:08.931
Oh, I've done a lot of things with
a lot of different people and...

25:08.983 --> 25:11.809
that's part of the reason I'm sure...

25:11.861 --> 25:14.572
that we're something special.

25:15.781 --> 25:17.940
But, for you, it...

25:21.621 --> 25:26.407
I don't want you to stay with
me just because I'm the first.

25:26.459 --> 25:28.909
So, you should see other people.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.630
You should.

25:31.881 --> 25:35.926
- I don't want to. - I only
meant... - I don't need to.

25:44.393 --> 25:48.189
.. that there's only just one
other person out there for you.

27:44.680 --> 27:46.432
Scottie?

27:51.187 --> 27:52.793
Scottie?!

27:56.651 --> 27:58.277
Scottie?

28:04.992 --> 28:07.276
Scottie?!

28:07.328 --> 28:08.861
Scottie?

28:15.211 --> 28:18.203
- I was just remembering.
- Huh?

28:22.218 --> 28:24.178
A place.

28:31.727 --> 28:33.959
I was remembering...

28:34.188 --> 28:35.856
.. a place.

28:38.234 --> 28:40.309
Right, we need to get you to the hospital.

28:40.361 --> 28:43.572
Will you just listen
to me, for once, Danny?!

28:49.787 --> 28:52.707
You were remembering... a place.

29:09.765 --> 29:12.414
A place where no-one cares.

29:31.912 --> 29:33.518
Pathetic.

29:37.960 --> 29:39.566
Thank you.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.128
My parents used to chide me.

29:49.180 --> 29:51.964
"You were such a happy child."

29:54.101 --> 29:55.707
How long?

29:57.021 --> 29:58.627
Like this?

30:00.608 --> 30:02.349
Three weeks.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.740
Worse and worse each day.

30:09.951 --> 30:12.662
Now as bad as it's ever been.

30:16.374 --> 30:18.532
It can't be coincidence, can it?

30:18.584 --> 30:21.963
30 years I've been OK and, now, like this?

30:25.925 --> 30:29.668
Why might someone who's managed
depression for 30 years

30:29.720 --> 30:32.296
suddenly suffer a relapse?

30:32.974 --> 30:34.850
For no reason?

30:37.979 --> 30:40.012
This is what we're going to do.

30:40.064 --> 30:41.805
We'll get new pills.

30:41.857 --> 30:45.517
Real pills from a different doctor.

30:45.569 --> 30:48.687
You can keep them on you at all...

30:48.739 --> 30:51.909
Unless they switch them
before they give them to you.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.559
I'll get them illegally.

30:55.871 --> 30:59.000
I know someone. He can get anything.

31:05.631 --> 31:07.508
On your shell.

31:09.719 --> 31:12.159
Until they find a crack.

31:14.098 --> 31:15.704
A frailty.

31:17.351 --> 31:19.301
A vulnerability.

31:21.022 --> 31:23.253
No matter how small.

31:25.985 --> 31:28.425
And then they pick away.

31:35.786 --> 31:38.497
How do you kill an alcoholic?

31:38.998 --> 31:40.864
With alcohol.

31:40.916 --> 31:43.701
How do you kill a drug addict?

31:43.836 --> 31:45.786
With drugs.

31:45.838 --> 31:48.549
How do you kill a depressive?

31:50.968 --> 31:52.626
Where'd you get them?

31:52.678 --> 31:55.629
People tell the doctor whatever story,

31:55.681 --> 31:58.298
collect a prescription, sell it to me.

31:58.351 --> 32:01.771
They're good. It's all
good. Always good from me.

32:02.897 --> 32:04.930
Do you want something else?

32:04.982 --> 32:06.807
No.

32:06.859 --> 32:08.673
Nothing else.

32:18.245 --> 32:19.851
Thank you.

32:59.954 --> 33:02.811
Have you examined the contents?

33:03.124 --> 33:05.626
We're going to need help.

33:07.003 --> 33:09.297
With help comes risk.

33:09.922 --> 33:13.290
The more people you involve...

33:13.342 --> 33:16.053
Look what they've done to us.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.849
That was before they knew we had this.

33:24.812 --> 33:27.043
I can do this alone.

33:34.572 --> 33:36.657
There are rumours.

33:37.700 --> 33:40.192
About how the... Kremlin

33:40.244 --> 33:43.789
guarantees the loyalty of
its most important citizens.

33:45.916 --> 33:50.285
Under the pretext of celebrating
an election to the State Duma,

33:50.338 --> 33:56.542
the individual is treated to the
finest meal Moscow has to offer.

33:56.594 --> 33:59.639
At some point during that night...

34:00.973 --> 34:04.101
.. this prized individual blacks out...

34:04.602 --> 34:06.593
.. waking in a hotel suite,

34:06.646 --> 34:10.315
on a bed, beside a terrified naked child.

34:12.025 --> 34:16.228
Before he can say anything, the
FSB storm the room, arrest him,

34:16.280 --> 34:21.315
and take him to an interrogation
cell in Moscow's Butyrka prison,

34:21.369 --> 34:24.069
where the individual swears
he is not a paedophile.

34:24.121 --> 34:27.197
"My drink must have been spiked!"

34:27.248 --> 34:30.492
"I, I've been framed by my
enemies!" He doesn't know.

34:30.543 --> 34:33.672
He can't explain. "But it is a mistake!"

34:33.922 --> 34:36.415
And, to his surprise...

34:36.467 --> 34:39.501
the FSB officer agrees
that it is a mistake,

34:39.553 --> 34:43.714
but it is a mistake they
will hold on record forever,

34:43.766 --> 34:46.925
a mistake no-one will ever see, unless...

34:46.978 --> 34:51.138
the individual makes a
mistake of a political kind.

34:51.190 --> 34:53.974
And, with that, the
man's choice is clear --

34:54.025 --> 34:56.351
privilege or disgrace.

34:56.404 --> 34:58.437
Destruction or survival.

34:58.489 --> 35:01.607
The FSB officer believes he's won.

35:01.659 --> 35:03.692
The individual believes he's lost.

35:03.744 --> 35:06.737
But those systems of oppression...

35:07.748 --> 35:10.532
.. as ruthless as they appear,

35:10.584 --> 35:13.535
as unbeatable as they seem, never hold,

35:13.587 --> 35:16.121
never last, never survive,

35:16.173 --> 35:18.884
for we will not live in fear.

35:22.555 --> 35:25.631
I would like to finish this
particular adventure with you,

35:25.683 --> 35:27.841
Daniel Edward Holt.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.979
If you'll have me.

35:35.484 --> 35:37.716
We're being watched.

35:38.154 --> 35:40.385
We will be followed.

35:41.324 --> 35:43.357
So we separate.

35:43.409 --> 35:45.609
Shake them off.

35:45.661 --> 35:47.986
And meet up at a place...

35:48.039 --> 35:51.542
where no-one can follow us
without revealing themselves.

36:26.869 --> 36:29.580
The place where no-one cares?

36:31.332 --> 36:35.576
I've always taken comfort from
the idea that people don't care.

36:35.628 --> 36:37.661
That they have better
things to think about,

36:37.713 --> 36:41.331
that there are more important
matters to worry about.

36:41.384 --> 36:43.250
I like it when people walk past me

36:43.302 --> 36:47.838
and couldn't care less what I'm
wearing, or whose hand I'm holding.

36:47.890 --> 36:50.632
The place where no-one cares.

36:50.685 --> 36:54.053
When I was young, I spent a
lot of time searching for it,

36:54.105 --> 36:57.473
and I promised myself, if I ever found it,

36:57.525 --> 37:00.778
if it ever existed, that's
where I'd make my home.

37:36.856 --> 37:38.941
What do you think?

37:40.901 --> 37:43.102
Ambition.

37:43.154 --> 37:45.239
But no conviction.

37:46.240 --> 37:50.317
You skip from short stories to lyrics,

37:50.369 --> 37:52.903
from poems to sketches,

37:52.955 --> 37:55.072
hoping the world will
tell you who you are.

37:55.124 --> 37:57.564
You must tell the world.

38:13.017 --> 38:14.883
There you are.

38:14.935 --> 38:16.927
Well done.

38:16.979 --> 38:18.387
You weren't followed?

38:18.439 --> 38:20.180
Well, I hope not.

38:20.232 --> 38:22.672
So, will Marcus help us?

38:23.986 --> 38:25.863
He didn't say.

38:30.242 --> 38:31.525
Keep back,

38:31.577 --> 38:35.414
and then that gives you
your 'B' for 'Baritone'.

38:36.791 --> 38:40.127
- Oh, I see -- no,
four, of course. - Yes.

38:40.544 --> 38:43.328
- And that's got...
- Where did you two meet?

38:43.381 --> 38:45.289
Cambridge.

38:45.341 --> 38:47.364
We shared a flat.

38:50.388 --> 38:54.673
I was the first person he shared
the secret of his sexuality with.

38:54.725 --> 38:57.217
At that time, it was illegal.

38:57.270 --> 38:59.678
And there were rumours.

38:59.730 --> 39:03.734
So, then, I... agreed to play
the part of... his lover.

39:05.027 --> 39:08.479
And we walked around arm in arm, and we...

39:08.531 --> 39:11.867
had picnics in the scholar's garden and...

39:14.078 --> 39:16.987
.. it was supposed to last
about two months or so.

39:17.039 --> 39:19.271
It lasted two years.

39:20.668 --> 39:22.409
Are you gay?

39:23.296 --> 39:24.630
No.

39:26.882 --> 39:29.041
Did you see other people?

39:29.093 --> 39:31.210
No.

39:31.262 --> 39:35.224
I tried to become the man
I was pretending to be.

39:38.769 --> 39:42.627
You know, I prayed for
the right kind of desire?

39:45.484 --> 39:48.717
- A sham romance, you might say. - No.

39:50.197 --> 39:51.657
No, no.

39:54.285 --> 39:57.986
We're friends. We have been ever since.

39:58.039 --> 40:01.156
We can't be sad about that. I
refuse to be sad about that.

40:01.208 --> 40:03.575
It's all very touching.

40:06.172 --> 40:07.871
Marcus...

40:07.923 --> 40:11.500
This is Danny, Alex's
partner. And Scottie.

40:11.552 --> 40:13.293
Where is it?

41:32.216 --> 41:33.676
Cheers.

41:49.734 --> 41:52.987
You didn't know, did
you? How smart he was?

41:54.071 --> 41:55.646
I knew.

41:55.698 --> 41:57.648
But not really.

42:00.661 --> 42:03.310
Not in the way you did, no.

42:05.750 --> 42:08.117
His partner...

42:08.169 --> 42:11.203
without any appreciation of his intellect.

42:11.255 --> 42:15.551
Beyond some generalised idea
that he was good with numbers.

42:16.719 --> 42:19.086
Love without knowledge.

42:19.597 --> 42:23.768
Popular culture might depict that
as a romantic notion, I suppose.

42:25.603 --> 42:28.470
He never spoke about his work.

42:28.522 --> 42:29.972
What did you talk about?

42:30.024 --> 42:31.974
Everything else.

42:32.652 --> 42:35.519
I see.

42:35.571 --> 42:38.491
No, I don't. I don't see at all.

42:42.244 --> 42:44.528
Well, what did you two talk about?

42:44.580 --> 42:47.541
- Outside of work?
- We didn't.

42:48.918 --> 42:51.285
Look, try to understand,

42:51.337 --> 42:52.995
I was sure,

42:53.047 --> 42:58.208
absolutely certain that he was going
to change the world in some way.

42:58.260 --> 43:02.004
Not my world. THE world.

43:02.056 --> 43:05.090
Can you imagine the
enormity of that feeling?

43:05.142 --> 43:08.771
Being in the company of someone like that?

43:14.443 --> 43:16.946
We knew different people.

43:17.113 --> 43:18.645
Hmm.

43:18.698 --> 43:21.555
The man I knew was exceptional.

43:21.617 --> 43:24.401
- The man you knew was not. - The...
- Unless you're going to tell me

43:24.453 --> 43:27.915
how many sugars he took in his
tea, or how he liked to be fucked.

43:30.918 --> 43:33.660
Are these the details that define us?

43:33.713 --> 43:35.662
I think that...

43:36.132 --> 43:38.999
.. being admired is lonely.

43:39.051 --> 43:40.667
You're right, I'm sure.

43:40.720 --> 43:43.587
But that was the price he had to pay.

43:43.639 --> 43:46.298
The ordinary world wasn't for him.

43:46.350 --> 43:49.301
And his flirtation with it...

43:49.353 --> 43:52.137
was always going to end badly.

43:57.153 --> 43:58.758
Professor?

44:01.073 --> 44:03.023
I miss him, too.

44:38.444 --> 44:40.185
He did it.

44:40.237 --> 44:43.897
The 9/11 attackers sent e-mails

44:43.950 --> 44:46.025
using pre-arranged code words.

44:46.077 --> 44:49.194
"The Faculty Of Urban Planning"
was the World Trade Center.

44:49.246 --> 44:52.614
The, uh, The Pentagon was
"The Faculty Of Fine Arts".

44:52.667 --> 44:57.077
Mohammed Atta's final message
to the other terrorists

44:57.129 --> 44:59.580
referred to their semesters beginning

44:59.632 --> 45:03.886
in three weeks at the faculties
of Urban Planning and Fine Arts.

45:15.398 --> 45:17.139
Two e-mails.

45:20.319 --> 45:21.935
In this one,

45:21.988 --> 45:24.104
"zoo" means zoo.

45:24.156 --> 45:26.774
In this one, it means airport.

45:26.826 --> 45:29.474
How do you tell them apart?

45:30.579 --> 45:32.071
When...

45:32.123 --> 45:34.114
people...

45:34.166 --> 45:36.492
who go to the zoo

45:36.544 --> 45:38.421
also visit...

45:39.630 --> 45:41.299
.. museums.

45:42.633 --> 45:45.167
They watch animated movies.

45:45.219 --> 45:47.961
Buy children's clothes.

45:48.014 --> 45:52.132
And donate... to animal charities.

45:52.184 --> 45:57.262
Convert our entire online
history into numbers,

45:57.315 --> 45:59.765
and a visit to the zoo...

45:59.817 --> 46:02.434
looks...

46:02.486 --> 46:04.092
like this.

46:06.032 --> 46:08.743
A coded message looks...

46:12.705 --> 46:14.519
.. like this.

46:18.794 --> 46:22.621
The 9/11 terrorists used innocent words,

46:22.673 --> 46:25.040
but they didn't use
them like the rest of us.

46:25.092 --> 46:29.221
We like to think of
ourselves as individuals.

46:31.474 --> 46:33.173
But we're not.

46:33.225 --> 46:34.633
We're a pattern.

46:34.685 --> 46:36.468
We are...

46:36.520 --> 46:38.522
married, gay...

46:39.941 --> 46:42.307
.. straight, professional,

46:42.360 --> 46:44.278
rich, poor.

46:47.239 --> 46:49.732
Our online DNA,

46:49.784 --> 46:52.641
revealing... our true nature...

46:53.579 --> 46:55.487
.. even...

46:55.539 --> 46:57.281
when we lie.

47:00.294 --> 47:03.527
I told him he would change the world.

47:04.840 --> 47:08.803
I just didn't tell him
how dangerous it would be.

47:12.098 --> 47:15.643
Alex decided to apply
his concept to speech.

47:17.186 --> 47:19.803
Words don't occur in isolation.

47:19.855 --> 47:22.222
They're part of a series of actions.

47:22.275 --> 47:24.058
Your intake of breath,

47:24.110 --> 47:28.520
facial gestures, pupil
dilation, hand movements.

47:28.572 --> 47:31.523
Alex theorised they formed patterns,

47:31.575 --> 47:33.901
and these patterns would be different

47:33.953 --> 47:36.570
if we were telling the
truth or telling a lie.

47:36.622 --> 47:38.697
A lie detector?

47:38.749 --> 47:40.991
Important lies are told
by important people.

47:41.043 --> 47:43.911
They'd never consent
to a test of any kind.

47:43.963 --> 47:45.537
Alex didn't need their consent.

47:45.589 --> 47:48.040
They've already provided
all the information.

47:48.092 --> 47:52.127
The most important people in the
world are also the most documented.

47:52.179 --> 47:55.631
Study every word they've ever spoken.

47:55.683 --> 47:58.801
Mundane, profound -- it doesn't matter.

47:58.853 --> 48:01.595
Analyse every variable possible.

48:01.647 --> 48:03.806
Translate that information into numbers,

48:03.858 --> 48:06.100
and identify the patterns.

48:06.152 --> 48:07.893
A fingerprint...

48:07.945 --> 48:11.063
for our truths and our lies.

48:11.115 --> 48:13.565
We'd be able to analyse every statement.

48:13.618 --> 48:15.734
Every political claim.

48:15.786 --> 48:17.986
Er, every case for war.

48:18.039 --> 48:19.988
Every court case verdict.

48:20.041 --> 48:21.990
The end of lies.

48:31.886 --> 48:34.545
If the four of us survive a week,

48:34.597 --> 48:36.891
I'd be very surprised.

48:52.865 --> 48:56.723
You're a thoroughly nice
guy, aren't you, Danny?

48:57.453 --> 48:59.570
So was Alex.

48:59.622 --> 49:03.063
For all his intellect,
an innocent, really.

49:05.002 --> 49:09.038
When he told me he was going to work
for GCHQ, I knew it was a mistake.

49:09.090 --> 49:11.165
He didn't belong in that world.

49:11.217 --> 49:14.971
And I could feel him
wanting me to tell him so.

49:17.139 --> 49:19.840
Why didn't you say something?

49:19.892 --> 49:23.552
We didn't have that
kind of a relationship.

49:23.604 --> 49:26.972
I take it you have some kind of plan?

49:27.024 --> 49:29.391
We must prove it works.

49:39.412 --> 49:40.903
You don't have a plan, do you?

49:40.955 --> 49:42.529
No.

49:42.581 --> 49:46.127
He needed to believe I
did. And we need him.

49:46.752 --> 49:47.951
You see?

49:48.004 --> 49:50.954
Proof -- the orderly
functioning of society

49:51.007 --> 49:53.415
depends on our ability to lie.

49:53.467 --> 49:56.960
Given the choice of no lies,
or lies, every organization,

49:57.013 --> 50:01.225
every person of power, without
exception, will choose lies.

50:02.435 --> 50:06.397
Maybe Alex imagined a
better way of doing things.

50:08.065 --> 50:11.611
I wonder when he began
work on this project.

50:12.278 --> 50:13.977
Why does that matter?

50:14.030 --> 50:17.690
Maybe he was ashamed of
the lies he'd told you.

50:17.742 --> 50:21.443
Ashamed that your
relationship was built on lies.

50:21.495 --> 50:23.404
Maybe on some level,

50:23.456 --> 50:25.739
he thought he was making amends.

50:25.791 --> 50:28.023
- To who?
- To you.

50:35.968 --> 50:37.637
Danny!

50:49.857 --> 50:52.568
- I'm to blame.
- I'm sorry.

50:54.070 --> 50:55.561
I'm to blame.

50:55.613 --> 50:58.053
I never said "to blame".

50:59.367 --> 51:01.389
He did it for me?

51:02.370 --> 51:04.246
It's possible.

51:05.873 --> 51:07.656
I never asked for it.

51:07.708 --> 51:12.494
He knew you'd find out that
he'd lied about much of his life.

51:12.546 --> 51:15.039
He must have worried that
you'd end up hating him.

51:15.091 --> 51:18.000
He must have worried about
that moment every day.

51:18.052 --> 51:19.793
Would you still love him if you knew?

51:19.845 --> 51:22.921
Could you still love him if you knew?

51:22.974 --> 51:27.561
Would you re-examine your love
story -- Alex's only love story...

51:28.771 --> 51:33.599
.. and decide, in the end,
it was nothing but a lie?

51:33.651 --> 51:35.736
He was never sure.

51:36.279 --> 51:38.228
How could he be?

51:42.410 --> 51:45.069
I wish I could've told him.

51:45.121 --> 51:47.613
That none of it mattered.

51:47.665 --> 51:50.032
The lies, the mistakes.

51:51.711 --> 51:54.630
That I loved him, just the same.

51:55.548 --> 51:59.176
That I, I love him. Still.
Now. Knowing it all.

52:02.388 --> 52:05.422
I wish he could've heard me say it.

52:05.474 --> 52:06.851
Yes.

52:11.314 --> 52:13.336
He'll never know.

52:13.774 --> 52:15.026
No.

53:05.117 --> 53:08.110
This is going to sound a, a bit...

53:09.038 --> 53:12.792
But... it occurred to me I'd
never said it out loud before.

53:15.378 --> 53:17.046
I love you.

53:18.255 --> 53:19.861
Very much.

54:06.429 --> 54:09.286
You're not going to be charged.

54:16.564 --> 54:18.232
Is that it?

54:19.984 --> 54:22.069
You're free to go.

54:24.905 --> 54:28.659
You brought me here like
this to tell me that?

54:32.538 --> 54:34.905
Will anyone be charged?

54:39.879 --> 54:41.412
Danny...

54:43.007 --> 54:44.821
.. for you...

54:45.760 --> 54:47.710
.. this is over.

54:48.554 --> 54:50.504
This isn't over.

55:01.943 --> 55:03.892
This isn't over.

56:46.631 --> 56:48.862
- Scottie?
- Danny.

56:57.391 --> 56:59.842
- Danny...
- Scottie?

56:59.894 --> 57:02.188
There will be a note.
