01:34.681 --> 01:36.649
- Ah.
- Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

01:36.650 --> 01:39.151
Yeah! - Whoo!

01:44.858 --> 01:46.992
Oh, nice move.

01:46.993 --> 01:49.228
Oh, you're too fast, annie.

01:49.229 --> 01:52.865
Sometimes I think you're
letting me get through.

01:52.866 --> 01:56.602
This week my team's buying the beers,
so you have to come.

01:56.603 --> 01:58.070
You certainly take
the direct approach.

01:58.071 --> 01:59.472
Ah, well, sometimes in soccer,

01:59.473 --> 02:01.140
You have to score goals.

02:01.141 --> 02:03.943
You know who said that?
Thierry henry.

02:03.944 --> 02:07.513
Ay, you've just become
the ultimate woman.

02:07.514 --> 02:09.914
Maybe we skip the drinks, huh? -

02:09.916 --> 02:12.485
You know, I'd forgotten how
forward latin men can be.

02:12.486 --> 02:14.253
No, annie, wait.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

02:16.556 --> 02:18.023
Give me a reason to stay.

02:18.024 --> 02:20.125
Uh...

02:21.761 --> 02:23.862
I'll do anything you ask me.

02:38.178 --> 02:39.945
Of course I do.
You work for the smithsonian.

02:39.946 --> 02:41.981
You play midfield like juan arango.

02:41.982 --> 02:45.017
And now-now you're bilingual-
very impressive.

02:45.018 --> 02:46.519
Do you know enough to trust me?

02:46.520 --> 02:50.289
- Is there a reason not to?
- I need you to do me a favor.

02:50.290 --> 02:51.924
I told you...

02:51.925 --> 02:54.260
Anything you ask me.

02:54.261 --> 02:57.830
I need you to help me
get to your sister julia.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.872
Transcript by Addic7ed.com

04:03.870 --> 04:05.637
My sister?

04:05.638 --> 04:07.940
What-what do you know about julia?

04:07.941 --> 04:09.908
Actually quite a lot.

04:09.909 --> 04:12.878
She raised you like a mother,
pays your tuition.

04:12.879 --> 04:15.314
She still lives in the house
where you grew up in la dorita.

04:15.315 --> 04:17.916
Uh, it's a favela-a slum.

04:17.916 --> 04:19.885
Which is why she homeschooled you

04:19.886 --> 04:22.454
And wants you to be a doctor.
Pediatric surgeon.

04:22.455 --> 04:23.889
She lights a candle
every Sunday at mass

04:23.890 --> 04:25.991
To be sure you do.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

04:25.992 --> 04:27.192
How-how do you know this?

04:27.193 --> 04:28.794
I have friends in caracas.

04:31.064 --> 04:34.466
Who? Is this a joke?

04:34.467 --> 04:36.068
My friends also tell
me she's the manager

04:36.069 --> 04:37.736
At banco nacional.

04:37.737 --> 04:39.271
In fact, she's the personal banker

04:39.272 --> 04:40.873
Of victor ponces.

04:40.874 --> 04:43.409
Oh, she handles the accounts
of many government officials.

04:43.410 --> 04:46.445
She's also his mistress.

04:48.581 --> 04:52.084
Who, uh, gives you
this kind of information?

04:52.085 --> 04:53.952
For the past three years,

04:53.953 --> 04:58.090
Julia's helped ponces skim
over a hundred million dollars

04:58.091 --> 04:59.958
To profits owed u.S. Oil companies

04:59.959 --> 05:03.429
Producing venezuelan oil.

05:03.430 --> 05:04.930
They transfer the money
from a secure terminal

05:04.931 --> 05:09.501
In her bank to a secret
offshore account in the caymans.

05:09.502 --> 05:11.737
There isn't a government official

05:11.738 --> 05:14.139
In caracas who doesn't
line his pockets.

05:14.140 --> 05:15.808
Not that much, diego.

05:15.809 --> 05:17.676
These are large dollars
that my friends believe

05:17.677 --> 05:19.545
Are funding organizations

05:19.546 --> 05:21.280
That want to
destabilize the region.

05:21.281 --> 05:23.749
We need to look into that account

05:23.750 --> 05:26.118
And see exactly where
the money's going.

05:26.119 --> 05:28.020
And in order to do that,
you need julia.

05:28.021 --> 05:30.656
Yeah.

05:30.657 --> 05:32.124
Hmm.

05:32.125 --> 05:35.093
And now I know who you are.

05:35.094 --> 05:36.295
It was time, diego.

05:36.296 --> 05:41.200
You can still trust me.

05:41.201 --> 05:42.968
And what if the
money's going somewhere

05:42.969 --> 05:44.369
Your friends don't like, huh?

05:44.370 --> 05:46.705
That's above my pay grade.

05:46.706 --> 05:48.707
But I am authorized to tell you

05:48.708 --> 05:50.843
That we'll protect both
you and your sister.

05:50.844 --> 05:55.113
We'll give you new lives here
and pay for your education.

05:55.114 --> 05:58.450
What if she doesn't
want to do it?

05:58.451 --> 06:01.954
you don't know julia.

06:01.955 --> 06:04.990
That's why I'm talking
to the brother she adores.

06:04.991 --> 06:06.391
You do know her.

06:06.392 --> 06:08.527
You can introduce us to her,

06:08.528 --> 06:10.429
Help her understand that this
is the right thing to do,

06:10.430 --> 06:11.530
The smart thing.

06:11.531 --> 06:14.399
Look, I know this is...

06:14.400 --> 06:17.469
a lot to take in.

06:17.470 --> 06:20.572
But if you help us,
you will be protected.

06:23.042 --> 06:27.012
If not, my guess is julia's
gonna get pulled into this

06:27.013 --> 06:28.580
Whether she wants to or not,

06:28.581 --> 06:30.849
And you'll be on the
first flight home,

06:30.850 --> 06:32.718
With a canceled student visa

06:32.719 --> 06:35.220
And no chance of getting back in.

06:41.194 --> 06:44.930
I'm gonna need your
answer by tonight, diego.

06:44.931 --> 06:47.933
And if it's yes,
next time I'll buy the beers.

06:56.809 --> 06:59.845
He sat there for 20
minutes after she left.

06:59.846 --> 07:01.346
No phone calls,
no texts- I would've heard.

07:01.347 --> 07:03.181
Didn't say anything to anyone.

07:03.182 --> 07:05.250
- We think he's clean.
- Or very careful.

07:05.251 --> 07:06.885
And that still doesn't explain

07:06.886 --> 07:08.420
What you were doing out
in the field with annie.

07:08.421 --> 07:09.821
I ran into her at the game.

07:09.822 --> 07:12.291
Suddenly you're a fan
of intramural soccer?

07:12.292 --> 07:14.393
Only on sundays and just
for the past few weeks.

07:14.394 --> 07:16.228
How many times do we have
to go through this, auggie?

07:16.229 --> 07:19.598
You are not sanctioned for
field duty, not anymore.

07:19.599 --> 07:21.199
I can't afford to lose you, okay?

07:21.200 --> 07:22.968
I need you here.

07:22.969 --> 07:24.937
Time to move on.

07:24.938 --> 07:26.638
Annie.

07:28.241 --> 07:30.309
Is your smithsonian cover in place?

07:30.310 --> 07:33.378
Uh, yeah. Got my I.D. Yesterday.

07:33.379 --> 07:35.314
Too bad about the photo.

07:35.315 --> 07:37.015
Have travel book you and
the brother to caracas.

07:37.016 --> 07:39.117
I'm sure you can come up
with something museum-worthy

07:39.118 --> 07:40.252
To acquire there.

07:40.253 --> 07:41.420
You're sending me?

07:41.421 --> 07:43.322
Just to hold his
hand on the plane.

07:43.323 --> 07:45.324
Our station agent will
meet you at the airport.

07:45.325 --> 07:48.594
You'll make the introductions,
and he'll take diego from there.

07:48.595 --> 07:49.962
The kid knows you. He trusts you.

07:49.963 --> 07:52.030
That's what these past three
weeks have been about.

07:52.031 --> 07:53.732
He hasn't agreed to do it yet.

07:53.733 --> 07:55.667
He's a 20-year-old
kid with a crush.

07:55.668 --> 07:57.502
He'll come around.

08:01.040 --> 08:04.343
Jai, you're hovering.

08:04.344 --> 08:06.011
The caracas station agent.

08:06.012 --> 08:08.280
Mm-hmm, lopez-
have we heard from him?

08:08.281 --> 08:09.715
Not yet. But the chief down there

08:09.716 --> 08:11.183
Says he's been dropping
out for two or three days

08:11.184 --> 08:12.618
While working this job.

08:12.619 --> 08:14.886
So we have a day or two
before we need to worry.

08:23.463 --> 08:25.530
You might get a little
rain this time of year.

08:25.531 --> 08:27.699
If you're talking caracas,
I still haven't closed the deal.

08:27.700 --> 08:30.135
Well, his hormones
will close it for you.

08:31.571 --> 08:33.705
Why does everyone assume
diego has a crush on me?

08:33.706 --> 08:35.039
Maybe it has to do
with that little move

08:35.041 --> 08:36.942
He made towards your knee-

08:36.943 --> 08:38.909
Smooth.

08:38.910 --> 08:40.212
You didn't think auggie

08:40.212 --> 08:42.813
Was the only one covering
you today, did you?

08:46.686 --> 08:50.422
Looks like it's your
smithsonian line.

08:50.423 --> 08:54.026
Acquisitions, annie walker.

08:54.027 --> 08:55.527
<i>Hola, diego.</i>

08:55.528 --> 08:58.296
Well, I'm really glad you called.

08:58.297 --> 09:00.565
Yeah.

09:03.636 --> 09:05.470
"jupiter, king of the planets.

09:05.471 --> 09:08.173
Jupiter is the fifth
planet from our sun."

09:08.174 --> 09:09.641
Here you go, cuties. Eat up.

09:09.642 --> 09:11.209
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

09:11.210 --> 09:12.711
"1,300 earths could fit inside.

09:12.712 --> 09:14.413
What is it like on jupiter?"

09:14.414 --> 09:16.548
Chloe, that juice box
is for your lunch bag,

09:16.549 --> 09:18.183
Not your cereal.
Is this half-decaf?

09:18.184 --> 09:19.551
First pot, nitro.

09:19.552 --> 09:21.219
You want decaf?
Find a barista on the way.

09:21.220 --> 09:23.321
"jupiter's atmosphere
can crush..."

09:23.322 --> 09:26.024
That was for the lunch bag.

09:26.025 --> 09:28.493
Chloe, I'm serious.
Do not poke that straw

09:28.494 --> 09:31.263
Into that hole.

09:31.264 --> 09:33.532
Hey!

09:33.533 --> 09:35.133
Thank you.

09:35.134 --> 09:36.935
Oh, there's eggs on the stove.

09:36.936 --> 09:41.206
girls, the bus leaves in
ten minutes. Hurry up.

09:58.057 --> 10:00.258
Not gonna join us for breakfast?

10:00.259 --> 10:02.227
it's like a love
twister in there,

10:02.228 --> 10:03.962
Like being caught in a "momsoon."

10:03.963 --> 10:05.831
Put down roots,
you'll get through the weather.

10:05.832 --> 10:07.833
Put down roots,
you can't run from the storm.

10:07.834 --> 10:11.136
Stop quoting mom.
Let him go, annie.

10:11.137 --> 10:14.439
You were always the one telling
me to let go when we moved.

10:14.440 --> 10:16.675
Well, if you want to
survive as an army brat...

10:16.676 --> 10:19.044
Well, take your own advice now.

10:19.045 --> 10:22.447
You're right. It's stupid.
It's time to move on.

10:22.448 --> 10:24.182
Simobolivar and james monroe-

10:24.183 --> 10:25.784
<i>Partners in liberty...</i>

10:25.785 --> 10:27.352
And in boredom, I'm sure.

10:27.353 --> 10:28.887
It's more interesting
than you think.

10:28.888 --> 10:30.322
I'm studying it for the museum.

10:30.323 --> 10:31.823
More interesting
than cleveland anyway.

10:31.824 --> 10:33.058
Why are they sending you?

10:33.059 --> 10:34.459
We're thinking
about doing something

10:34.460 --> 10:36.461
With the, um,
rock and roll hall of fame.

10:36.462 --> 10:38.630
And you'll be cage
dancing in a bikini?

10:38.631 --> 10:40.932
It's for the hotel pool.

10:47.974 --> 10:50.742
Okay, first of all,
get your hand off my ass.

10:50.743 --> 10:52.911
I'm being your boyfriend.
It's my cover.

10:52.912 --> 10:57.883
Okay, be my boyfriend
without your hand on my ass.

10:57.884 --> 11:00.752
Thank you.

11:00.753 --> 11:02.921
We're looking for a
driver named lopez.

11:02.922 --> 11:06.691
He's wearing a gold 20
bolivar coin around his neck.

11:06.692 --> 11:08.960
- You know him?
- No.

11:08.961 --> 11:10.929
And, uh, how can you trust him?

11:10.930 --> 11:12.531
He's a cpany man.

11:12.532 --> 11:14.366
He'll be the one
talking to julia.

11:14.367 --> 11:16.168
With your help.

11:16.169 --> 11:18.236
She'd like you better.

11:18.237 --> 11:20.472
That's not an option.

11:20.473 --> 11:22.541
<i>Con permiso.</i>

11:22.542 --> 11:24.810
hello?

11:24.811 --> 11:26.044
Wheels down?

11:26.045 --> 11:27.445
Wheels down and
looking for my ride.

11:27.446 --> 11:29.481
I'm guessing he's gonna
be pretty hard to find.

11:29.482 --> 11:31.716
That's maria who gave you
the hip check and the phone.

11:31.717 --> 11:33.585
And rodriguez is
the man by the door

11:33.586 --> 11:35.387
With the questionable
taste in hats.

11:35.388 --> 11:36.922
Got him.

11:36.923 --> 11:39.157
He'll be keeping an eye on
you if we decide to go ahead.

11:39.158 --> 11:41.326
I- if we decide to go ahead?

11:41.327 --> 11:43.995
Lopez has been out of
contact for 72 hours.

11:43.996 --> 11:45.297
The station chief's worried.

11:45.298 --> 11:46.698
What does that mean?

11:46.699 --> 11:48.400
Well, it could
mean several things.

11:48.401 --> 11:50.335
He's sick. He's been compromised.

11:50.336 --> 11:53.171
He's being followed.
Or he's dead.

11:53.172 --> 11:55.774
It could mean he's dead.

11:55.775 --> 11:57.475
Yeah, well, we're trying
not to go there yet.

11:57.476 --> 11:59.444
But the bottom line is

11:59.445 --> 12:02.714
You just might be doing
this on your own.

12:08.646 --> 12:12.448
- He's been delayed?
- Maybe indefinitely.

12:12.449 --> 12:14.751
Our people are trying
to decide what to do.

12:14.752 --> 12:16.486
- Options?
- Cut our losses.

12:16.487 --> 12:17.821
We bail and bring them home.

12:17.822 --> 12:19.689
It's the syrian arms
thing all over again.

12:19.690 --> 12:21.224
Ponces will have time
to move his accounts,

12:21.225 --> 12:22.726
And we'll be back to square one.

12:22.727 --> 12:24.528
Agreed. If lopez
has been compromised,

12:24.529 --> 12:26.129
We don't have much time.

12:26.130 --> 12:27.597
Have one of the other
station agents handle it.

12:27.598 --> 12:29.166
Did lopez read them in?

12:29.167 --> 12:30.634
Just the bullet points.
Annie knows at least as much.

12:30.635 --> 12:31.768
More.

12:31.769 --> 12:33.403
She's fluent. She knows caracas.

12:33.404 --> 12:34.805
And she has a
relationship with diego.

12:34.806 --> 12:36.173
But she's green.

12:36.174 --> 12:37.774
It's her inexperience
versus a closing window.

12:37.775 --> 12:39.743
Might be a good idea
to notify the d.N.I.

12:39.744 --> 12:41.211
Bring the bureau into the loop.

12:41.212 --> 12:42.479
Have they got justice
to approve the tap

12:42.480 --> 12:43.814
On diego's phone yet?

12:43.815 --> 12:45.148
Not until we brief
them on the mission.

12:45.149 --> 12:46.616
<i>They're looking for quid pro quo.</i>

12:46.617 --> 12:47.984
Well, they're not gonna get it.

12:47.985 --> 12:51.421
Who else is at the airport?
Maria and rodriguez.

12:51.422 --> 12:54.524
Keep them close.
Let's make this annie's show.

12:54.525 --> 12:56.092
And tap the kid's phone.

13:00.131 --> 13:01.798
Will you settle down?

13:01.799 --> 13:03.433
I think you're
losing your watchdogs.

13:03.434 --> 13:05.836
They'll keep up.

13:05.837 --> 13:07.704
How long have you
been doing this?

13:07.705 --> 13:10.340
Long enough.

13:10.341 --> 13:11.441
So not very long.

13:11.442 --> 13:13.743
But long enough.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.918
Don't overdo it.

13:21.919 --> 13:25.788
And keep your hands
where they belong.

13:32.597 --> 13:34.231
- Diego?
- Julia.

13:38.936 --> 13:42.038
This is the girl I was
telling you about. Annie.

13:46.777 --> 13:48.778
You're the,
uh- the football player,

13:48.779 --> 13:51.348
The smithsonian museum girl. - Yes.

13:51.349 --> 13:52.949
I have some business here tomorrow,

13:52.950 --> 13:54.985
And I used my mileage
to bring diego along.

13:54.986 --> 13:57.053
Ah, she wanted to meet you.

13:57.054 --> 13:59.089
Business in caracas?

13:59.090 --> 14:01.258
Mm. I'm looking at a letter
that james monroe wrote

14:01.259 --> 14:04.427
To simon bolivar.

14:04.428 --> 14:07.664
Well, you must
need to freshen up.

14:07.665 --> 14:09.899
Come. Let me show you.

14:11.235 --> 14:14.938
So how old are you- 26, 27?

14:14.939 --> 14:17.307
- 28.
- Even worse.

14:17.308 --> 14:19.075
How dare you date
a 20-year-old boy.

14:19.076 --> 14:21.378
Oh, I-

14:21.379 --> 14:23.046
He needs to study, to learn.

14:23.047 --> 14:25.415
You american women are all
cougars with hot tubs.

14:25.416 --> 14:26.816
Julia, I'm not-

14:26.817 --> 14:28.852
He's there to get an education.

14:28.853 --> 14:30.754
- I understand.
- A book education.

14:30.755 --> 14:35.558
I'm not sleeping
with your brother.

14:35.559 --> 14:38.461
So then what?

14:38.462 --> 14:40.363
You're not here to look
at a letter to bolivar.

14:40.364 --> 14:42.165
Actually, I am.

14:42.166 --> 14:45.668
But my real business
here is with you.

14:50.841 --> 14:52.275
You didn't know
cougars like hot tubs?

14:52.276 --> 14:55.011
Well, I guess I do now.
Still no sign of lopez?

14:55.012 --> 14:56.479
At this point,
that might be a good thing.

14:56.480 --> 14:58.348
We don't want to throw
too many people at her.

14:58.349 --> 14:59.683
Keep it calm and simple, annie.

14:59.684 --> 15:00.884
Don't give her any wiggle room.

15:00.885 --> 15:02.419
She means wiggle-free.

15:02.420 --> 15:05.622
"wiggleless"- got it.

15:07.892 --> 15:09.592
Was that you as a kid?

15:09.593 --> 15:11.361
Ah, that was me.

15:12.863 --> 15:14.497
Your sister looks
like a popular girl.

15:14.498 --> 15:16.833
Yeah. It takes her an hour
to walk a couple of blocks.

15:16.834 --> 15:19.703
<i>Everyone wants to talk to la
madre de la favela.</i>

15:19.704 --> 15:21.404
"the mother of the neighborhood."

15:21.405 --> 15:24.074
She loves it here.

15:24.075 --> 15:26.009
I couldn't wait to get out.

15:26.010 --> 15:28.244
The other kids, they would
tag all this hate graffiti

15:28.245 --> 15:29.579
About the u.S.

15:29.580 --> 15:32.915
Me, I used to dream about it.

15:48.799 --> 15:51.501
Everyone in the government
takes a little cream.

15:51.502 --> 15:53.870
Victor takes more than a little.

15:53.871 --> 15:55.972
Our interest is in what
he's doing with it.

15:55.973 --> 15:57.407
He likes cars.

15:57.408 --> 16:00.877
This goes way beyond cars.
You know that.

16:00.878 --> 16:05.615
What I know is that
victor is a good man,

16:05.616 --> 16:07.083
A loving man.

16:07.084 --> 16:10.020
He's a criminal
with many enemies.

16:10.021 --> 16:11.488
I don't believe that.

16:11.489 --> 16:15.358
And he's married
with many mistresses.

16:17.461 --> 16:21.431
We see what we want
in the people we love.

16:21.432 --> 16:23.933
Romance can be blinding.

16:23.934 --> 16:26.102
You don't have to go
down with him, julia,

16:26.103 --> 16:27.904
But he will go down.

16:27.905 --> 16:29.506
All you'll be doing
is giving us a look

16:29.507 --> 16:31.174
At where his money's going.

16:31.175 --> 16:33.510
You put an electronic tag on
the account in the caymans

16:33.511 --> 16:34.778
So we can get access to it.

16:34.779 --> 16:36.780
It's a simple
three-digit identifier

16:36.781 --> 16:38.915
That you type in after
the account number.

16:38.916 --> 16:41.217
He'll find out.

16:41.218 --> 16:43.253
Eventually.

16:43.254 --> 16:45.655
But by then, you'll be
safely out of the country

16:45.656 --> 16:46.956
And resettled.

16:58.436 --> 17:01.938
You say that so easily.

17:01.939 --> 17:05.775
Leave victor and my country,
leave la dorita.

17:05.776 --> 17:09.979
You saw those kids.
They need me here.

17:14.852 --> 17:15.952
When I was growing up,

17:15.953 --> 17:18.488
We moved every three or four years.

17:18.489 --> 17:19.989
It's what you do in the military.

17:19.990 --> 17:21.391
It's hard at first.

17:21.392 --> 17:24.426
But I learned to build a
wall around those emotions.

17:24.428 --> 17:25.829
How?

17:25.829 --> 17:27.630
I took the pictures
of all the friends

17:27.631 --> 17:30.100
That I had made,
put them in a shoe box,

17:30.101 --> 17:31.835
And buried them in the backyard.

17:31.836 --> 17:35.138
my sister thought I was crazy.

17:35.139 --> 17:37.874
But it was something I
had to do to let go.

17:37.875 --> 17:41.878
Staying wasn't an option.
I had no choice.

17:41.879 --> 17:44.414
And ither do you.

17:44.415 --> 17:47.283
So I put victor in a shoe box?

17:47.284 --> 17:50.687
There's no future with him.

17:50.688 --> 17:54.023
Don't try to reason with love.

17:54.024 --> 17:56.226
Then don't get burned by it.

17:56.227 --> 17:58.261
Because it happened to you.

18:00.764 --> 18:04.901
I see. And now you are
a woman with walls.

18:14.345 --> 18:16.312
How long's it been?

18:16.313 --> 18:19.048
About three hours.

18:19.049 --> 18:21.217
It's the toughest thing we do...

18:21.218 --> 18:25.188
Convincing people to let
go of their lives...

18:25.189 --> 18:27.824
Even when they don't have a choice.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.405
They call you the
mother of the favela.

18:42.406 --> 18:45.108
They are all my children.

18:45.109 --> 18:47.610
And diego...

18:47.611 --> 18:49.646
Isn't he as much a
son as a brother?

18:49.647 --> 18:52.916
You raised him, homeschooled him.

18:52.917 --> 18:56.085
Doesn't he count?

18:56.086 --> 18:58.655
Doing this guarantees his dream...

18:58.656 --> 19:01.758
A medical degree from the u.S.
, citizenship for you both.

19:01.759 --> 19:04.194
His dream is to come back,

19:04.195 --> 19:06.563
To practice here.

19:06.564 --> 19:08.965
You sure about that?

19:08.966 --> 19:10.900
Why don't you ask him?

19:14.538 --> 19:19.042
This is the door to
his future, to yours.

19:19.043 --> 19:20.810
Walk through it.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.079
You have to think of victor
and all this as your past.

19:23.080 --> 19:24.948
- No.
- Julia.

19:24.949 --> 19:28.184
No. I will not do this
to prove victor's guilt.

19:28.185 --> 19:31.521
Then do it to
prove his innocence.

19:31.522 --> 19:33.523
Prove us wrong.

19:33.524 --> 19:36.292
We will go away.

19:40.531 --> 19:41.931
Julia's in.

19:41.932 --> 19:43.833
There's only one problem.

19:43.834 --> 19:47.036
Ponces needs a password to
access the cayman account,

19:47.037 --> 19:51.808
And the password changes
every minute for security.

19:51.809 --> 19:54.277
- So he carries a coded fob.
- You know about the fob?

19:54.278 --> 19:56.446
Yeah, yeah. They're-they're
pretty common.

19:56.447 --> 19:59.082
It's, uh-it's about the
size of a jump drive

19:59.083 --> 20:00.850
With a small screen.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.119
When the fob gets close
to the bank terminal,

20:03.120 --> 20:06.422
The terminal sends the correct
account password to the fob.

20:06.423 --> 20:08.992
Ponces reads it. -

20:08.993 --> 20:11.294
Julia types it into the terminal,
and they're in.

20:11.295 --> 20:13.529
Bottom line-we need it.

20:13.530 --> 20:15.031
And I'm betting
he's never without it,

20:15.032 --> 20:16.499
Probably showers with it.

20:16.500 --> 20:17.834
This is one of those jobs

20:17.835 --> 20:19.569
Where nothing's ever easy,
isn't it?

20:19.570 --> 20:21.771
Yeah, but look at the
pension and the medical.

20:21.772 --> 20:23.806
And the chance to
spend tropical nights

20:23.807 --> 20:25.208
With 20-year-old men.

20:27.044 --> 20:29.045
<i>He's sleeping on the couch.</i>

20:29.046 --> 20:31.047
The fob, please.

20:31.048 --> 20:32.582
Uh, right.

20:32.583 --> 20:34.384
We're switching his for
julia's after lunch tomorrow.

20:34.385 --> 20:36.152
Julia has one too?

20:36.153 --> 20:37.453
All the bank managers have them

20:37.454 --> 20:38.821
For their other
restricted accounts.

20:38.822 --> 20:40.757
They're coded differently,
but they look the same.

20:40.758 --> 20:42.091
Where are you gonna do it?

20:42.092 --> 20:44.294
Julia and victor have
a standing lunch date

20:44.295 --> 20:45.895
At his beach club,

20:45.896 --> 20:48.298
Followed by a siesta
after in a private room.

20:48.299 --> 20:50.500
Diego and I are invited
along for the lunch part,

20:50.501 --> 20:53.903
And julia will pull the switch after,
when he's sleeping.

20:56.740 --> 20:59.208
Diego...

20:59.209 --> 21:02.478
Look at you now.

21:02.479 --> 21:05.448
Ah, you leave here a boy,
and you return a man,

21:05.449 --> 21:07.383
With a woman you don't deserve.
Victor ponces.

21:07.384 --> 21:10.420
Annie walker. Pleasure.

21:10.421 --> 21:11.821
Julia tells me you're in caracas

21:11.822 --> 21:13.823
To look at a bolivar
letter for the smithsonian.

21:13.824 --> 21:16.659
Actually, it's a
letter james monroe wrote

21:16.660 --> 21:19.162
To simon bolivar,
thanking him for the statue

21:19.163 --> 21:20.763
Of the harpy eagle he sent

21:20.764 --> 21:22.765
After the signing of
the monroe ctrine.

21:22.766 --> 21:24.567
We have the statue
at the smithsonian,

21:24.568 --> 21:26.035
And we'd like to display
the thank-you letter

21:26.036 --> 21:27.437
Along with it.

21:27.438 --> 21:30.340
Well, I would love it if
you would do me the honor

21:30.341 --> 21:32.909
Of accompanying you this afternoon.

21:32.910 --> 21:36.946
Diego can drive julia
back in your rental car.

21:36.947 --> 21:38.348
I would gladly skip a siesta

21:38.349 --> 21:40.783
To look at a letter from
the last american president

21:40.784 --> 21:43.519
To care about anything
south of his own border.

21:51.428 --> 21:54.097
Is rodriquez sure
it's lopez's necklace?

21:54.098 --> 21:55.932
Well, they minted half
a million of those coins.

21:55.933 --> 21:57.433
There must be thousands like it.

21:57.434 --> 21:59.669
- He recognizes the chain.
- From across the room?

21:59.670 --> 22:01.738
Apparently from across the room.

22:01.739 --> 22:04.540
Caracas p.D. Found lopez's
body 20 minutes ago

22:04.541 --> 22:07.410
In several pieces.

22:13.704 --> 22:15.104
We should call it.

22:15.105 --> 22:17.206
If lopez has been compromised,
she's been compromised.

22:17.207 --> 22:18.608
No, you can't make that jump.

22:18.609 --> 22:20.576
Julia called ponces last night?

22:20.577 --> 22:23.479
Just to make the lunch date.
Analysts say it was clean.

22:23.480 --> 22:25.248
No calls outut from the kid either.

22:25.249 --> 22:27.183
So we have no reason
to believe he's made her.

22:27.184 --> 22:29.185
Ponces has to be suspicious.

22:29.186 --> 22:31.054
Why? She's 28 and looks
like a cheerleader.

22:31.055 --> 22:33.456
So you hear.

22:33.457 --> 22:35.525
Point taken.

22:35.526 --> 22:37.660
Annie doesn't look
like a foreign op.

22:37.661 --> 22:39.629
He'll test her.
He'll try to draw her out.

22:39.630 --> 22:41.197
But we've got people
all around her.

22:41.198 --> 22:42.732
There's no reason
to call it off now.

22:48.539 --> 22:50.907
They were both
opposed to imperialism-

22:50.908 --> 22:52.742
Great allies in the fight.

22:52.743 --> 22:54.344
Not exactly.

22:54.345 --> 22:56.846
Bolivar greatly admired
monroe for the doctrine.

22:56.847 --> 22:59.282
But in later years,
he considered the United States

22:59.283 --> 23:01.250
Just as bad as Spain.

23:01.251 --> 23:03.252
Yes.

23:03.253 --> 23:07.023
What was his quote?

23:07.024 --> 23:10.993
"the United States appear
to be destined by providen

23:10.994 --> 23:14.764
To plague america with misery
in the name of liberty."

23:14.765 --> 23:17.834
<i>Exactamente.</i>

23:17.835 --> 23:21.637
So nice to be with a yankee who
can quote more than lincoln.

23:21.638 --> 23:24.407
Shall we? I want to leave
time for the drive.

23:24.408 --> 23:26.809
I should probably use
the powder room first.

23:26.810 --> 23:28.811
I'll join you.

23:41.692 --> 23:43.159
Hmm.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.496
He likes blonds.

23:46.497 --> 23:48.297
Maybe you'll have an opportunity.

23:48.298 --> 23:52.168
The ride back isn't
about sex, julia.

23:52.169 --> 23:53.636
The gold piece around your neck,

23:53.637 --> 23:55.905
Is that a recent gift from victor?

23:55.906 --> 23:57.807
He gave it to me Sunday.

23:57.808 --> 24:00.143
Pretty sure it belonged
to a colleague of mine.

24:00.144 --> 24:02.345
And what's that supposed to mean-

24:02.346 --> 24:03.980
victor stole it from him?

24:03.981 --> 24:05.381
No.

24:05.382 --> 24:08.251
I think it means he killed him.

24:08.252 --> 24:10.353
Have you said anything to him
that could compromise me?

24:10.354 --> 24:11.654
I need you to tell me the truth.

24:11.655 --> 24:13.356
No. Nothing.

24:13.357 --> 24:14.690
I need you and diego
to go back to the bank

24:14.691 --> 24:16.225
And wait for me there.

24:16.226 --> 24:17.760
What if victor drives you back?

24:17.761 --> 24:21.030
I'll make sure he doesn't.

24:21.031 --> 24:23.866
Our flight's at 5:30.

24:23.867 --> 24:27.403
Your flight, annie.

24:27.404 --> 24:30.106
In my heart, I know you're wrong.

24:30.107 --> 24:32.808
But in your head,
I think you know I'm right.

24:45.556 --> 24:48.057
I can come by tonight.

24:48.058 --> 24:50.726
The door will be open.

24:50.727 --> 24:52.828
Annie.

25:07.244 --> 25:10.112
Carroll shelby used to
do this to his passengers

25:10.113 --> 25:12.849
When he gave them a
ride in his cobra.

25:12.850 --> 25:15.651
If you can take those bills
in the next ten seconds,

25:15.652 --> 25:17.887
They're yours.

25:24.094 --> 25:30.967
* *

25:30.968 --> 25:33.736
You must tell me, annie,

25:33.737 --> 25:36.906
What does a worldly,
educated woman like you

25:36.907 --> 25:38.674
See in someone like diego?

25:38.675 --> 25:42.311
You must have many men
at your beck and call.

25:42.312 --> 25:44.380
I like how ambitious he is,

25:44.381 --> 25:46.816
That he wants to do
something with his life.

25:57.294 --> 25:59.629
A doctor of some kind, isn't it?

25:59.630 --> 26:02.598
- Pediatric surgeon.
- That's right.

26:02.599 --> 26:04.200
It's admirable.

26:04.201 --> 26:07.236
Still, young men...

26:07.237 --> 26:09.272
Make such bad lovers.

26:09.273 --> 26:12.575
I think you should be dating
someone closer to your own age,

26:12.576 --> 26:15.377
Maybe older.

26:23.420 --> 26:25.354
Your turn. - My turn?

26:25.355 --> 26:28.291
Mm-hmm. To drive.

26:28.292 --> 26:30.092
Oh...

26:30.093 --> 26:31.627
I couldn't. I- I'd ruin it.

26:31.628 --> 26:34.130
Somehow I doubt that.

26:34.131 --> 26:37.700
Please. These roads
were meant for this car.

26:44.174 --> 26:46.008
Sure you want to do this?

26:46.009 --> 26:48.477
Positive.

26:48.478 --> 26:51.447
That way I can keep my eye on you

26:51.448 --> 26:55.084
Instead of the road.

26:55.085 --> 26:58.387
It's your car.

27:07.030 --> 27:09.999
Ooh. My bad.

27:14.871 --> 27:16.672
Ah.

27:16.673 --> 27:18.841
So, so sorry.

27:18.842 --> 27:20.776
Third gear.

27:24.014 --> 27:26.182
Faster. - Please. I-I can't.

27:26.183 --> 27:29.318
I think you can, annie.

27:29.319 --> 27:31.954
I had my men search
your car at lunch.

27:31.955 --> 27:33.823
Strange how many of your answers

27:33.824 --> 27:37.293
Seem to come straight
from this book.

27:37.294 --> 27:39.028
You even highlighted
the bolivar quote.

27:43.100 --> 27:45.134
Smithsonian employees
have to bone up.

27:45.135 --> 27:46.569
It's part of the job.

27:46.570 --> 27:49.972
Particularly new employees,
I'm sure.

27:49.973 --> 27:51.974
This looks like it
was made yesterday.

27:51.975 --> 27:54.377
Faster-fourth gear now.

27:54.378 --> 27:56.312
Please, I can't.

27:56.313 --> 27:58.414
I just don't think you're trying.

28:21.838 --> 28:23.572
Yes.

28:23.573 --> 28:25.341
Damn.

28:25.342 --> 28:27.176
You see, no one can do that

28:27.177 --> 28:30.713
Without considerable training.

28:35.886 --> 28:40.056
Now, please, get out of the car.

28:40.057 --> 28:41.957
My associates will take
you back into town.

28:41.958 --> 28:44.226
They'll be right here.

28:56.206 --> 28:58.073
Ow! Ooh!

29:22.886 --> 29:24.987
I think we better skip
the whole museum thing.

29:24.988 --> 29:27.122
I don't want to bleed
on the bolivar letter.

29:27.123 --> 29:29.358
Yeah, we'll send your regrets.
How bad is it?

29:29.359 --> 29:32.061
It's a surface wound, but messy.

29:32.062 --> 29:34.163
I'm ruining the inside of his car.

29:34.164 --> 29:35.464
Sweet.

29:35.465 --> 29:37.599
Where are julia and diego?

29:37.600 --> 29:39.168
In the bank.

29:39.169 --> 29:41.270
We have a guy outside-
a cabbie with a beard.

29:41.271 --> 29:43.005
He'll take you to the airport.

29:43.006 --> 29:45.207
Does he have an extra dress?

30:09.899 --> 30:11.066
- Annie.
- I'm okay.

30:11.067 --> 30:12.868
Let's do it.

30:12.869 --> 30:14.770
Julia, we have to hurry.

30:14.771 --> 30:17.439
- What did you do to him?
- It's not the time.

30:17.440 --> 30:20.142
- Is he alive?
- Yes.

30:20.143 --> 30:22.578
That's why we have to hurry.

30:22.579 --> 30:24.780
There's a first-aid
kit around the corner.

30:24.781 --> 30:27.082
Wait by the ladies' room.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.183
Bring your purse.

30:28.184 --> 30:30.385
We're not coming back.

30:39.562 --> 30:42.898
<i>"entonces." - entonces.</i>

31:11.327 --> 31:15.531
All right, our cabbie reports
that elvis is in the building.

31:15.532 --> 31:18.400
Damn. Give me the
tag digits again.

31:18.401 --> 31:19.768
9 bravo 7.

31:19.769 --> 31:23.205
<i>Nueve be siete.</i>

31:28.945 --> 31:30.746
- We're in.
- We got it, annie. We're in.

31:30.747 --> 31:32.448
Thank you, julia.

31:32.449 --> 31:34.116
Victor's here, isn't he?

31:34.117 --> 31:36.585
Please tell me there's
a side way out of here.

31:36.586 --> 31:38.220
It trigger's the alarm.

31:54.471 --> 31:56.171
They're coming
back for you, annie.

31:56.172 --> 31:58.841
- Julia, we have to go.
- Is it bad?

31:58.842 --> 32:00.776
Is victor what you say he is?

32:00.777 --> 32:03.212
He shot me, julia.

32:03.213 --> 32:05.414
The red hits are
the flagged accounts

32:05.415 --> 32:07.616
Of known organizations.

32:07.617 --> 32:09.518
That one's farc.

32:09.519 --> 32:11.153
This account's tied to
the hezbollah in asuncion.

32:11.154 --> 32:12.421
It's all actionable.

32:14.124 --> 32:15.591
<i>Puerta.</i>

32:18.261 --> 32:20.129
He's coming back here.

32:20.130 --> 32:21.396
You have to get out, annie.

32:21.397 --> 32:22.864
We have to go.

32:30.073 --> 32:31.740
<i>Por favor, mantengan la calma.</i>

32:31.741 --> 32:33.308
<i>Calma, por favor.</i>

32:34.944 --> 32:36.945
- Your car.
- We leave it.

32:39.215 --> 32:41.483
what about diego?

32:41.484 --> 32:43.018
We have a man out front.
He'll get him.

32:43.019 --> 32:45.954
Get in! Get in!

32:45.955 --> 32:48.991
Julia, don't do this. - No.

32:48.992 --> 32:51.326
He's your enemy. It-it's over.

32:56.933 --> 32:58.900
It's over, julia.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.878
Annie, we just texted diego.

33:09.879 --> 33:11.947
He's on his way to
our guy out front.

33:11.948 --> 33:13.615
Thanks, auggie.

33:13.616 --> 33:15.317
Don't want to leave
the boyfriend behind.

33:17.987 --> 33:20.255
Confiscate their phones
before they get on the plane.

33:20.256 --> 33:22.791
We need this intel analyzed
before ponces shuts it down.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.327
No one goes home tonight.

33:40.777 --> 33:43.779
- Go, go, go.
- You gonna miss it?

33:43.780 --> 33:46.915
I'm sure there's a pickup
game where we're going.

33:46.916 --> 33:48.584
I'll adjust.

33:48.585 --> 33:51.119
And julia?

33:51.120 --> 33:54.823
It's been a tough couple of days.

33:54.824 --> 33:58.460
She doesn't let go easily.

33:58.461 --> 34:01.563
All roots, no walls.

34:01.564 --> 34:04.166
She loved it back there, annie.

34:04.167 --> 34:08.070
And I keep asking myself if, uh...

34:08.071 --> 34:09.705
I did the right thing.

34:09.706 --> 34:12.139
They tell you where
you're going yet?

34:12.141 --> 34:15.811
Mm. Only that we're
going tomorrow.

34:15.812 --> 34:18.547
We should probably get back
to the safe house, huh?

34:31.393 --> 34:34.696
was that a sigh?

34:34.697 --> 34:36.565
It sounded like a sigh,

34:36.565 --> 34:40.302
Like a troubled, guilty sigh.

34:40.303 --> 34:42.871
This is the business, annie.
It's what we do.

34:42.871 --> 34:44.840
Fact is, you should be
feeling pretty good.

34:44.841 --> 34:47.141
Yeah, well,
my shoulder's still sore.

34:47.143 --> 34:49.011
And my sister can't
understand how a car accident

34:49.012 --> 34:50.846
Would cause me to
lose the $300 carry-on

34:50.847 --> 34:53.447
She gave me for my birthday.

34:53.449 --> 34:55.117
And I've got a 20-year-old lothario

34:55.118 --> 34:58.186
Bragging that he spent the
night with me in caracas.

34:58.187 --> 35:00.722
- Oh, aside from that...
- Aside from that, I'm fine.

35:00.723 --> 35:03.025
And you shouldn't be here.

35:03.026 --> 35:06.361
Oh, Sunday's I'm drawn to the
sound of a thundering herd.

35:06.362 --> 35:08.163
Sue me.

35:08.164 --> 35:10.899
Still, if joan found out...

35:10.900 --> 35:13.735
She knows what it's like
to jones to fieldwork.

35:13.736 --> 35:15.704
I think she envies you.

35:15.705 --> 35:19.141
- I bet she was pretty good.
- One of the best.

35:19.142 --> 35:21.543
I bet you were pretty good.

35:21.544 --> 35:25.080
Still am.

35:25.081 --> 35:28.083
And I envy you too.

35:28.084 --> 35:31.086
All that "time to move
on" crap joan preaches,

35:31.087 --> 35:33.355
I don't buy into it for a second.

35:33.356 --> 35:36.325
Every step forward begins
with a firmly planted foot

35:36.326 --> 35:38.960
In the past.

35:41.531 --> 35:44.199
Auggie?

35:44.200 --> 35:46.601
Were you able to trace all
of victor's skim money?

35:46.602 --> 35:48.103
Mm-mm. There were a
couple of personal accounts

35:48.104 --> 35:49.771
In the caymans we
couldn't get into.

35:49.772 --> 35:52.307
Small change-we figure victor
was taking a cut for himself.

35:52.308 --> 35:55.877
And where does diego's
tuition money come from?

35:55.878 --> 35:57.379
From julia's
account in venezuela.

35:57.380 --> 36:00.882
I can bring it up.

36:00.883 --> 36:04.619
What funds that account,
anything besides her job?

36:06.122 --> 36:08.323
Money from one of the
cayman accounts...

36:08.324 --> 36:09.725
From ponces.

36:09.726 --> 36:12.728
- Can I get you guys anything?
- I'm not hungry.

36:12.729 --> 36:14.796
I'll be in the shower.

36:27.110 --> 36:29.378
So ponces was giving her a cut?

36:29.379 --> 36:30.746
Yeah, she's using
the funds to pay

36:30.747 --> 36:32.881
For neighborhood kids'
education-ten in all.

36:32.882 --> 36:34.649
Also a food bank
and a free clinic.

36:34.650 --> 36:36.752
<i>They call her la madre
de la favela.</i>

36:36.753 --> 36:38.587
"the mother of
the favela"- sweet.

36:38.588 --> 36:40.288
You going somewhere with this?

36:40.289 --> 36:41.890
Part of the reason she
didn't want to leave

36:41.891 --> 36:43.125
Is she didn't want to give it up.

36:43.126 --> 36:44.626
It's more than just loving ponces.

36:44.627 --> 36:46.027
She doesn't want to
stop funding the kids.

36:46.028 --> 36:47.295
And she hasn't.

36:47.296 --> 36:48.697
There were payments
made out of her account

36:48.698 --> 36:49.898
As recent as yesterday.

36:49.899 --> 36:51.366
- By her?
- Looks that way.

36:51.367 --> 36:53.935
How? She doesn't have access
to a phone or a computer.

36:53.936 --> 36:56.805
But she could've
borrowed one or stole one.

36:56.806 --> 36:58.874
She wouldn't try to
contact ponces, would she?

36:58.875 --> 37:00.976
The station in caracas
said he went underground.

37:00.977 --> 37:03.745
We're betting she already did.
I'll be at the safe house.

37:03.746 --> 37:07.182
Let's get her backup.
And alert the airports.

37:22.899 --> 37:25.133
I'm going downstairs

37:25.134 --> 37:26.835
For some coffee.

37:26.836 --> 37:29.704
Would you like me to, uh,
bring you back a latte?

37:29.705 --> 37:31.473
- I'll come with you.
- No. No.

37:31.474 --> 37:33.708
It's in the building, mr. Hughes.

37:33.709 --> 37:35.643
I'll be gone five minutes.

37:39.674 --> 37:41.241
She wasn't at the coffee shop.

37:41.242 --> 37:44.177
We ran a four-block grid.
Texts on my phone are deleted.

37:44.178 --> 37:45.412
I never should've done this.

37:45.413 --> 37:47.047
I never should've made her come.

37:47.048 --> 37:49.616
We'll find her.

37:49.617 --> 37:50.950
No, you stay, diego.

37:50.951 --> 37:52.852
No, no, not now.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.689
We might need him to talk to her.

37:55.690 --> 37:58.291
did you contact
the cab companies?

38:10.538 --> 38:12.305
Excellent call on the taxis-
we got a hit.

38:12.306 --> 38:14.040
Where was the pickup?

38:14.041 --> 38:16.409
Fairfax and wessling.

38:16.410 --> 38:18.078
The fare was wearing a purple shirt

38:18.079 --> 38:20.547
And a tan trench coat.
That's her.

38:20.548 --> 38:22.515
Well, drop-off was
about five minutes ago

38:22.516 --> 38:24.484
Near the band shell
at east potomac park.

38:24.485 --> 38:26.720
P.D.'s got to have a unit close.

38:26.721 --> 38:29.055
Park rangers, fbi. - On it.

38:29.056 --> 38:31.157
Annie, stand down.
Units are on the way.

38:31.158 --> 38:33.760
- I'm less than five away.
- Let somebody else do it.

38:33.761 --> 38:36.996
- I have hughes in the car.
- Then let him do it.

38:36.997 --> 38:38.932
Good luck with that.

38:38.933 --> 38:41.468
You might want to
hold on to your gun.

38:46.907 --> 38:48.608
<i>Oh, mi victor.</i>

38:53.347 --> 38:55.948
- How much further?
- Just past the tidal basin.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.521
I knew you'd forgive me.

39:01.522 --> 39:03.556
You had no choice.

39:05.693 --> 39:08.495
- Do you have my passport?
- It's in the car.

39:08.496 --> 39:11.531
we should go.
