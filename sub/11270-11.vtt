WEBVTT

00:11.400 --> 00:13.359
- Excuse me.
- Yes, sir?

00:13.488 --> 00:16.064
Can you see if the table's ready
for Phillips?

00:16.367 --> 00:18.659
Sure. Be glad to.

00:20.000 --> 00:26.074

01:01.084 --> 01:02.877
What was the name again?

01:05.300 --> 01:07.924
- Phillips.
- Phillips!

02:38.990 --> 02:40.651
Lock up your daughters!

02:44.208 --> 02:47.711
The fightin' Double Deuce
is on the loose!

02:49.636 --> 02:51.880
- Can l help you?
- You should help me.

02:52.016 --> 02:56.018
l helped you. l fought the Kaiser
when your daddy was in diapers.

02:56.525 --> 03:00.657
- Where's the rest of my outfit?
- What you got on looks silly enough.

03:02.370 --> 03:06.835
l mean the other boys from the 22nd
Brigade. l'm meeting them here.

03:06.963 --> 03:10.086
l hope you're not expecting
a whole brigade? l'm low on lemons.

03:10.219 --> 03:15.646
No, just the guys from my squad.
What's left of 'em. l'm Buzz Crowder.

03:15.772 --> 03:21.532
Sam, l got this one. Buzz, l'm
the fella you talked to this morning.

03:21.659 --> 03:24.235
l didn't recognise the uniform
on the telephone.

03:24.373 --> 03:28.327
Come on. Let me show you
the back room. lt's in the back.

03:29.091 --> 03:31.335
Sorry about that.
Can l get you a drink?

03:31.470 --> 03:36.767
l don't drink. But keep plenty for
the others. Lotta catching up to do.

03:36.898 --> 03:40.734
We meet in this bar
every ten years to reminisce.

03:40.864 --> 03:42.859
What war were you in?

03:42.994 --> 03:45.321
The First World War, of course.

03:45.457 --> 03:49.079
ls that the one
with Clark Gable or Gary Cooper?

03:50.175 --> 03:53.262
Wow! l'm 85. What's your excuse?

03:54.141 --> 03:55.934
Baseball!

03:56.438 --> 03:59.525
- What you writing, Slats?
- My thoughts.

03:59.652 --> 04:02.442
That would explain
all the blank pages.

04:04.579 --> 04:10.920
l'm writing during the odd moments
of the job, much as Jack London did.

04:11.050 --> 04:13.294
Was he a bad waitress, too?

04:14.182 --> 04:17.221
Ladies, please. Enough girl talk.

04:21.071 --> 04:22.697
Any sex in it?

04:24.369 --> 04:28.585
l've started writing down bits
of conversation l hear in the bar.

04:28.711 --> 04:34.257
Sometimes people say things that
strike me as snippets of Americana.

04:35.349 --> 04:39.398
You mean things said by
customers, employees?

04:39.524 --> 04:41.769
- Yeah.
- The owner?

04:42.781 --> 04:45.109
l'm afraid you're not represented.

04:46.413 --> 04:49.833
Just my luck.
She doesn't like my snippets.

04:51.632 --> 04:54.553
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

04:55.724 --> 04:58.396
- What you up to, Norm?
- My ears.

05:01.945 --> 05:05.483
- Want a beer, Norm?
- Does a rag doll have cloth knobs?

05:07.999 --> 05:10.492
There's a lady present, Norm.

05:11.798 --> 05:14.173
Sorry, Diane.

05:14.303 --> 05:16.214
Shot of bourbon.

05:16.808 --> 05:20.512
Sir? Save your quarter.
That piano hasn't worked in 20 years.

05:20.649 --> 05:25.150
Use the jukebox. lt doesn't work
either, but it's only a dime.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.742
Sammy,
why keep something that doesn't work?

05:27.872 --> 05:30.544
Cos no-one else'll give her a job!

05:31.713 --> 05:33.458
Ladies!

05:35.638 --> 05:38.048
- Got something good there?
- Yes.

05:38.185 --> 05:41.687
A remark a customer dropped
just a moment ago.

05:41.817 --> 05:44.310
Yeah? A quotable remark?

05:44.447 --> 05:49.447
Well, it occurs to me that sometimes
we find truth comes in a glass.

05:50.835 --> 05:52.877
Or a mug.

05:53.966 --> 05:56.008
Or your face.

05:59.185 --> 06:01.144
Pinky!

06:01.273 --> 06:03.101
You old grunt!

06:03.235 --> 06:05.907
Sammy...? Tinkerbell here, or what?

06:06.909 --> 06:10.246
Buzz? lsn't he a bit young
to be one of your guys?

06:11.711 --> 06:14.169
Of course! l'm sorry.

06:15.134 --> 06:18.637
From behind you look like
the young Pinky Peterson.

06:18.766 --> 06:21.723
You shouldn't grab people like that.

06:22.775 --> 06:25.149
lf l buy you a beer,
will you forget it?

06:25.280 --> 06:28.237
Buy me a pitcher,
you can kiss me on the lips!

06:31.333 --> 06:34.456
You're alright. l'll be in the back.

06:34.590 --> 06:36.169
Everything alright back there?

06:36.302 --> 06:38.926
Well, that room is kinda small.

06:39.057 --> 06:41.765
One grenade'll get us all!

06:46.990 --> 06:49.032
This looks like a nice saloon.

06:49.161 --> 06:51.452
We aspire to saloon.

06:51.583 --> 06:53.209
Can l just sit anywhere?

06:53.336 --> 06:57.172
Try the bar. lt makes good cover
during the gunfights.

07:00.434 --> 07:03.224
Hi. What'll you have?

07:04.317 --> 07:07.190
l'll have a carafe
of your house whisky.

07:10.162 --> 07:13.082
- Excuse me?
- ls that a bad order?

07:13.210 --> 07:15.750
Not if you're a party of twenty.

07:16.424 --> 07:19.631
- This is my first time in a bar.
- No kidding.

07:20.808 --> 07:24.893
Really. l was just passing
and dropped in to see what it's like.

07:25.025 --> 07:28.148
Does it live up to your expectations?

07:28.282 --> 07:32.747
l expected to see more lost,
desperate souls sitting around.

07:32.874 --> 07:35.083
Desperate souls night is Thursday.

07:35.212 --> 07:38.002
All the beer you can cry into
for a buck.

07:38.761 --> 07:41.551
- That's very amusing.
- Thank you.

07:41.684 --> 07:43.595
Where's Diane?

07:43.730 --> 07:46.983
l've never had hard liquor
in my life.

07:47.111 --> 07:49.901
You see, it's my last day
in the secular world.

07:50.034 --> 07:52.872
Tomorrow, l'm going into a monastery.

07:54.418 --> 07:57.125
So this is kind of your last fling?

07:57.257 --> 07:59.584
First and last.

08:00.472 --> 08:04.805
l'll give you a drink. But
take it easy, it sneaks up on you.

08:05.482 --> 08:08.985
- l once thought of being a priest.
- You're religious?

08:09.114 --> 08:12.071
No, l just thought
it'd be a nice, peaceful life.

08:12.997 --> 08:15.917
Allow me to dispel
your misconceptions.

08:16.045 --> 08:18.170
Thank you, Father.

08:26.357 --> 08:28.186
Can l get you something, Buzz?

08:28.320 --> 08:31.988
Not yet, Sam. l came out
to warn you about something.

08:32.119 --> 08:35.705
Me and the boys have got
a little joke we play on each other.

08:36.879 --> 08:40.417
First man here
always goes in the back room,

08:40.553 --> 08:43.640
strips down to his altogether,
yeah?

08:46.189 --> 08:48.683
Then he stands on the table,

08:48.819 --> 08:52.108
and when the others walk in,
he yells out,

08:52.243 --> 08:54.284
''Lafayette, we are here!''

08:57.253 --> 09:01.801
- Well, tonight it's my turn.
- Thanks for the warning, Buzz.

09:03.098 --> 09:07.182
Sam,... could you turn the heat up
just a little bit?

09:10.279 --> 09:12.440
A monk?

09:13.118 --> 09:15.992
Does that mean
you have to give up...?

09:16.124 --> 09:19.960
Well, as the French
so delicately put it, the old...?

09:22.930 --> 09:27.146
l have to take a vow of chastity.
l also have to take a vow of silence.

09:27.272 --> 09:30.810
Yep, give up sex,
you might as well give up talkin'.

09:31.697 --> 09:34.867
What fun is messing around
if you can't tell the guys.

09:36.290 --> 09:40.339
lt's no big deal. l never had
much luck with girls, anyway.

09:40.465 --> 09:42.507
They don't find me attractive.

09:43.388 --> 09:46.178
Kev, you're an attractive guy.

09:46.310 --> 09:48.352
- Diane?
- Yeah?

09:49.316 --> 09:51.857
Don't you think he's a specimen?

09:53.742 --> 09:56.829
Yes. He's a very attractive fellow.

10:01.132 --> 10:04.219
Come on,
l know l don't have any sex appeal.

10:04.347 --> 10:09.013
l'm shy, l'm serious-minded...
The search goes on for my chin.

10:14.492 --> 10:16.950
Kevin, speaking as a woman,

10:17.081 --> 10:21.628
l'm glad you're going in a monastery.
You could be a real heartbreaker.

10:22.508 --> 10:24.717
You're not a... bambo, are you?

10:25.974 --> 10:28.015
No... A bimbo.

10:30.149 --> 10:34.067
No, it's bimbo, not bambo,

10:34.199 --> 10:36.989
and l'm not one. But you are.

10:37.121 --> 10:39.911
Attractive. Yeah, attractive.

10:40.587 --> 10:42.415
What a great girl!

10:43.384 --> 10:45.960
Sam, is she taken?

10:46.098 --> 10:48.176
Only with herself.

10:49.354 --> 10:52.561
One drink in four hours.
ls that called nursing it?

10:52.694 --> 10:56.197
No, that's called
bringing it back from the dead.

10:57.412 --> 11:00.202
l hate to admit it
but Carla just got in the book.

11:00.335 --> 11:04.206
l always say, ''Nurse a drink,
starve a bartender.''

11:04.343 --> 11:06.171
Excuse me, Sam.

11:09.395 --> 11:11.686
Smite me again, barkeep!

11:11.816 --> 11:16.150
- Sure you want another one?
- Yes, l'm rather enjoying myself.

11:16.284 --> 11:20.831
OK, l'll make this one weaker.
No charge for the water.

11:20.960 --> 11:22.206
You needn't worry.

11:22.337 --> 11:26.505
l know l'm a novice drinker, but l've
only had one since l got here.

11:26.638 --> 11:29.214
l'm not ready for the lampshade yet.

11:32.149 --> 11:34.310
Excuse me.

11:34.445 --> 11:39.658
You know, Sam, that Kevin'll make a
great monk. He's got a good attitude.

11:39.789 --> 11:42.033
- Diane?
- Yes?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.879
l want you!

11:49.977 --> 11:51.936
Diane, are you OK?

11:52.607 --> 11:56.311
l'm OK. l'm fine.
l'd like to go freshen up a bit.

11:56.448 --> 11:58.407
Absolutely. You OK?

11:59.997 --> 12:02.371
Lafayette, we are here!

12:18.492 --> 12:21.995
Here's a little-known fact.
Most of you probably assume

12:22.125 --> 12:24.618
basketball was invented in the US,
right?

12:24.755 --> 12:26.797
James Naismith, Springfield College.

12:26.926 --> 12:29.634
Good thing l showed up tonight.

12:29.765 --> 12:32.555
Basketball was invented
thousands of years ago

12:32.688 --> 12:35.098
by the Mayans.
They played it for centuries.

12:35.235 --> 12:37.146
- ls that true?
- Sure.

12:37.280 --> 12:39.240
Watch me get the Coach on it.

12:39.368 --> 12:44.118
Coach. Got a question for you.
Who invented basketball?

12:44.253 --> 12:48.005
- The Mayans.
- Where did you hear that?

12:48.136 --> 12:51.722
How do l know? Must've been
a Mayan in here bragging about it.

12:53.146 --> 12:55.818
Buy 'em, Sammy.
Comeback time, let's go.

12:57.530 --> 13:00.368
Can l have your attention?

13:00.494 --> 13:04.496
l've been drinking all evening.
Now l have something to say.

13:04.627 --> 13:07.299
lt's down the hall to the left.

13:08.594 --> 13:11.467
First, l'd like to make
a public apology

13:11.600 --> 13:15.648
to the young lady l insulted earlier.
l lost my head.

13:15.775 --> 13:19.397
- Don't worry about it.
- Apology accepted, Kevin.

13:20.159 --> 13:23.578
Second, may l thank you all
for helping me see the light.

13:23.707 --> 13:27.044
lt is clear now
l am not fit for the monastery.

13:27.173 --> 13:30.177
l succumb too easily
to the pleasures of the flesh.

13:30.304 --> 13:32.465
That's OK. Don't worry about it.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.511
Tonight...

13:35.523 --> 13:38.978
Tonight has proven
that l belong here, in a bar,

13:39.113 --> 13:42.153
drinking booze
with seedy degenerates,

13:42.287 --> 13:45.125
and getting slapped around
by cheap dames.

13:45.251 --> 13:47.162
Kevin, it's our pleasure.

13:49.092 --> 13:51.800
l'm gonna give you
a real man's drink. Coffee.

13:51.931 --> 13:55.767
- Coffee? Men drink that?
- Men who've had too much to drink.

13:58.695 --> 14:00.855
- OK, Norm, pay up.
- Whaddaya say?

14:00.991 --> 14:03.401
Double or nothing on the highlights?

14:05.667 --> 14:09.669
- Sam, any of my squad check in?
- Not yet, Buzz.

14:09.800 --> 14:12.009
Maybe l won't wait for 'em.

14:13.308 --> 14:15.017
Send me back a ginger ale.

14:15.145 --> 14:20.607
Sam, l want a drink only men drink,
something that makes women sick.

14:20.739 --> 14:22.615
l'll give you some more coffee.

14:22.743 --> 14:25.201
No, l want something stronger.

14:25.332 --> 14:27.410
l'll give you yesterday's coffee.

14:28.755 --> 14:29.955
Kevin...

14:30.091 --> 14:36.017
lt's a big day ahead. How will you
feel, entering a monastery hungover?

14:36.145 --> 14:38.520
l'm serious, Sam. l'm not going.

14:38.650 --> 14:42.272
- Kevin, you're drunk.
- l am?

14:42.408 --> 14:44.486
Believe me,
l know what l'm talkin' about.

14:44.621 --> 14:47.114
What about your calling, Kevin?

14:47.251 --> 14:50.706
l never had a calling.
l talked myself into believing that.

14:51.384 --> 14:55.552
l've always been an ordinary person.
l thought it'd make me special.

14:55.685 --> 14:59.639
He's discovered forever is
a long time to go between hayrides.

15:01.321 --> 15:04.740
You're gonna turn your back on God
because of sex?

15:04.870 --> 15:08.408
Believe me, sex
is not that important.

15:12.176 --> 15:14.551
Well, it's not!

15:14.681 --> 15:16.427
Can sex make stars,

15:16.560 --> 15:19.849
or a tree or a rainbow?

15:20.944 --> 15:24.862
Can sex make an ocean
or a newborn baby?

15:24.994 --> 15:26.823
Forget that one.

15:29.920 --> 15:33.423
l know just what she means.
l once had a religious experience

15:33.553 --> 15:37.424
just watching a hummingbird,
hovering next to a flower.

15:38.062 --> 15:43.857
lt's almost impossible to imagine
something hanging in mid-air so long.

15:43.991 --> 15:46.781
l guess you never saw
one of my curve balls.

15:48.500 --> 15:54.010
You all think a man can't change
his life in one evening. But l have.

15:54.136 --> 15:56.594
l wanna be a regular guy.

15:56.725 --> 15:59.812
l wanna arm wrestle
and tell crude jokes

15:59.939 --> 16:02.018
and spit on the floor.

16:02.945 --> 16:05.783
And l wanna dance with cheap women.

16:05.910 --> 16:08.284
Carla, let's dance.

16:10.628 --> 16:13.252
Put that in your notebook,
l break your fingers.

16:13.968 --> 16:15.713
Kevin, sit down for a second.

16:15.846 --> 16:19.979
l wanna dance. l'm having the time
of my life. l don't want it to end.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.898
That doesn't even work.

16:22.026 --> 16:23.937
lt doesn't? Well, then...

16:32.797 --> 16:37.797
- l thought you said it was broken.
- lt it. lt was. For twenty years.

16:37.933 --> 16:39.309
My God!

16:40.563 --> 16:42.772
Kevin, you realise what this means?

16:42.901 --> 16:45.359
l've healed a piano?

16:47.744 --> 16:49.537
lt's a miracle or something.

16:49.665 --> 16:53.714
Wait, miracles don't happen.
Are you sure it was broken?

16:53.840 --> 16:56.298
Yes. The motor was rusted solid.

16:56.428 --> 16:58.507
How could this happen?

16:58.641 --> 17:01.016
Maybe something or somebody's

17:01.146 --> 17:03.355
trying to tell you
what to do with your life.

17:03.484 --> 17:05.693
Get into piano repair.

17:07.952 --> 17:11.324
No, wait a minute.
What are you trying to say?

17:13.253 --> 17:16.424
Kevin, you said
you're an ordinary person.

17:16.551 --> 17:20.174
Maybe you're not.
Maybe you have a direction.

17:21.395 --> 17:24.815
- You might as well try and find out.
- You're right.

17:24.944 --> 17:29.527
l've come too far to let one night
in a fleshpot change my whole life.

17:29.662 --> 17:31.990
- Yes.
- Thank you.

17:33.086 --> 17:35.544
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:36.509 --> 17:38.670
- Thank you.
- Hey, kid, alright!

17:41.018 --> 17:42.645
Thank you.

17:44.358 --> 17:46.187
You're welcome!

17:50.204 --> 17:51.830
Good night, Kev!

17:51.957 --> 17:54.451
- Bye, Kevin.
- See you in church!

17:54.587 --> 17:56.915
Good night.

17:59.973 --> 18:02.015
Boy, that was inspiring!

18:02.144 --> 18:06.098
- Sam, did you get that piano fixed?
- No, l didn't... Did you?

18:06.236 --> 18:08.564
Yeah, a couple of days ago.

18:10.035 --> 18:13.408
l meant to tell you about it
but it slipped my mind.

18:13.793 --> 18:17.664
Coach, why did you find it inspiring
if you got the piano fixed?

18:17.801 --> 18:22.931
Gee, Diane, that piano's been busted
for what, twenty years?

18:23.062 --> 18:25.555
Why did l suddenly decide
to get it fixed?

18:25.692 --> 18:27.936
This would make a great bar story.

18:28.614 --> 18:30.443
Too bad we're all here.

18:39.261 --> 18:43.726
- Poor Buzz. He's breaking my heart.
- None of his buddies showed?

18:43.854 --> 18:46.526
No. He's back there alone,
throwing darts.

18:46.651 --> 18:50.487
- He's been at it an hour and a half.
- Poor guy.

18:50.617 --> 18:56.127
They'll never make a pack big enough
to carry the loneliness of a soldier.

19:02.850 --> 19:05.094
Nah!

19:06.399 --> 19:07.811
Sam...

19:09.113 --> 19:11.072
What do l owe ya, Sam?

19:12.035 --> 19:15.205
Nothing, Buzz. The room's on us.
Forget it.

19:15.334 --> 19:17.209
Why, thanks.

19:23.517 --> 19:25.476
Hey, Buzz?

19:25.604 --> 19:28.442
l was in the army myself. Fort Dix.

19:28.569 --> 19:32.238
Yeah, l served in the navy, Buzz.
ln Pensacola.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.245
l was in the reserves.

19:36.251 --> 19:41.167
l was never in the Army, but l did
serve in uniform. l was a Brownie.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.891
l won merit badges.

19:45.854 --> 19:50.604
l was in Saint Cletus's Correctional
lnstitute for Wayward Girls.

19:52.116 --> 19:54.574
We used Brownies for firewood!

19:57.502 --> 20:03.962
You know? Every reunion we've had
has... thinned out a little more.

20:06.103 --> 20:08.775
l guess this is the last one.

20:12.574 --> 20:14.616
l guess l'm the last one.

20:17.793 --> 20:22.507
Or maybe they just forgot. People
get busy, make other commitments.

20:22.636 --> 20:24.180
Yeah.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.889
Maybe their lives aren't going well,
so they don't wanna come see you.

20:29.024 --> 20:31.315
Maybe they never liked you.

20:36.539 --> 20:39.876
Those guys would never just forget.

20:41.174 --> 20:45.507
No, not after the things
we went through together.

20:48.480 --> 20:50.522
No, sir.

20:59.544 --> 21:02.002
l'm gonna miss these reunions.

21:03.510 --> 21:09.103
Wait. lf you want some buddies
to get together with, we're here.

21:09.940 --> 21:13.894
We're not old coots like you,
but we feel like we know ya.

21:14.032 --> 21:15.777
lntimately!

21:16.453 --> 21:22.295
Look, Buzz, maybe we could have
a reunion every ten years.

21:22.424 --> 21:26.010
Why ten?
What's wrong with every year?

21:27.308 --> 21:29.350
How's about every week?

21:47.140 --> 21:49.384
Every ten years will be fine.

21:51.733 --> 21:54.523
Come on, Pinky,
l'll beat ya at darts!

21:54.655 --> 21:57.944
Yeah? We'll see about that.
Come on, everybody.

21:59.457 --> 22:03.375
You don't need me now, do you?
l've got an early class tomorrow.

22:03.506 --> 22:06.296
- No, that's alright. You can go.
- Thanks.

22:06.930 --> 22:11.727
You know something? Loneliness is
a good thing to share with someone.

22:12.942 --> 22:15.067
Wow...

22:16.867 --> 22:18.612
Wow?

22:19.372 --> 22:21.117
''...someone.''

22:22.002 --> 22:26.585
Would you get my purse for me?
This has been a great day.

22:26.720 --> 22:28.845
How could l have known when l woke up

22:28.975 --> 22:32.596
that l would meet a monk
and a doughboy?

22:33.692 --> 22:37.397
Two men with one foot in heaven.
That's good!

22:41.416 --> 22:43.874
Wait. Wait a second...

22:44.548 --> 22:48.217
lt's not like this is important to me
or anything,

22:48.347 --> 22:52.930
but are you aware l'm the only person
in this bar who's not in that book?

22:54.359 --> 22:55.771
Really?

22:55.904 --> 22:58.908
When l played baseball,
l was quoted all the time.

22:59.035 --> 23:02.954
Reporters hung around, waiting
for me to say something intelligent.

23:03.085 --> 23:05.376
l know the feeling!

23:06.258 --> 23:09.013
Sam, come on, that was a joke!

23:09.139 --> 23:12.511
No, it's not. You think
l'm too dumb to be in that book.

23:12.646 --> 23:17.194
Sam, there are a lot of people in
this book just as dumb as you are.

23:19.618 --> 23:21.245
Now, look.

23:21.372 --> 23:23.616
l want natural poetry, OK?

23:23.752 --> 23:27.290
l want spontaneous statements.
You've been trying too hard.

23:27.426 --> 23:32.093
Fine! l don't want to be in that
stupid, pretentious book, anyway.

23:32.227 --> 23:35.647
You've been writing
some pretty stupid stuff in it.

23:35.776 --> 23:38.566
l've heard some of that stuff.
lt's stupid.

23:38.699 --> 23:42.118
What does a stuffed shirt know
about blue-collar poetry?

23:42.247 --> 23:44.575
That's good, that's really good.
