Oh, this dinner party is
going to be so much fun.

00:36.003 --> 00:38.003
I get to be
with my drinking buddies

00:38.005 --> 00:39.638
and you get to be
with their wives.

00:39.640 --> 00:42.741
I can't believe you've never
been to Tim's pad before.

00:42.743 --> 00:46.645
Arianna was pretty judgmental
about me being a single mother.

00:46.647 --> 00:47.479
She always used to ask me

00:47.481 --> 00:51.583
how it felt to tear apart
the fabric of American society.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.851
How <i>did</i> it feel?

00:52.853 --> 00:53.685
(laughs)

00:53.687 --> 00:54.353
I'm just kidding.

00:54.355 --> 00:58.490
In her defense,
you <i>were driving down</i>
<i>real estate values</i> .

00:58.492 --> 00:59.792
But not anymore.

00:59.794 --> 01:02.461
Prince Charming has arrived.

01:02.463 --> 01:03.462
(doorbell rings)

01:03.464 --> 01:04.563
Last looks.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.697
Any chives?

01:06.466 --> 01:07.699
They're all over.

01:07.701 --> 01:09.268
What were you eating?

01:09.270 --> 01:09.735
Chives.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.638
Hey, everybody.
Who's your friend, Holt?

01:12.640 --> 01:14.706
Name's Fabrizia.
Doesn't speak English.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.575
But check out
those front air bags, huh?

01:16.577 --> 01:18.444
I'm gonna get in a wreck
tonight, right?

01:18.446 --> 01:19.945
(screeches, warbles)

01:19.947 --> 01:20.579
(laughs)

01:20.581 --> 01:21.680
Don't worry.
I'll be all right.

01:21.682 --> 01:23.515
Cleveland knows
what I'm talking about.

01:23.517 --> 01:26.852
Uh, her, uh... (humming)s?

01:26.854 --> 01:28.020
HOLT:
Count it.

01:28.022 --> 01:30.722
Hey, Lester,
where's your gross wife?

01:30.724 --> 01:31.890
KENDRA:
I'm out here.

01:31.892 --> 01:34.893
The Bears ain't got
no Rascal ramp.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.396
So you're just going
to sit outside?

01:37.398 --> 01:38.197
I don't mind.

01:38.199 --> 01:42.668
This way, I don't got to be
so conscious about my gas.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.602
(farts)

01:43.604 --> 01:45.437
There it is.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.773
Well, that was... food.

01:47.775 --> 01:50.275
I wish we could
stay longer, but...

01:50.277 --> 01:51.577
Okay, Celebrity!

01:51.579 --> 01:54.179
Only clue you can't give
is their name.

01:54.181 --> 01:55.180
Males against females.

01:55.182 --> 01:57.316
<i>Vorresti scopare o no?</i>

01:57.318 --> 01:59.485
Yeah, you're attractive, too.

01:59.487 --> 02:00.085
<i>Che cos'e?</i>

02:00.087 --> 02:01.854
(sputtering):
Whoa! You speak Italian?

02:01.856 --> 02:04.456
Don't ask her anything
about our relationship.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.357
She's a liar!

02:05.359 --> 02:08.594
<i>Lui mi deve settanta-cinque</i>
<i>dollari per un'ora.</i>

02:08.596 --> 02:12.598
She says you owe her $75
for one more hour.

02:12.600 --> 02:15.467
We had a bet that Tim would
want to play Celebrity.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.502
(chuckles):
You were right.

02:16.504 --> 02:21.840
<i>Non so che cosa ti ha detto,</i>
<i>ma io sono prostituta.</i>

02:21.842 --> 02:23.475
There was no bet.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.210
She is a prostitute.

02:25.212 --> 02:25.711
Huh.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.547
Come on, fellas, let's wipe
the floor with our wives

02:28.549 --> 02:30.849
and this woman Holt
pays to have sex with.

02:30.851 --> 02:31.817
Let's go, Cleveland.

02:31.819 --> 02:35.521
Ooh, somebody's afraid
her team's going to lose.

02:35.523 --> 02:37.222
"Oh, I'm a girl.

02:37.224 --> 02:39.258
"I'm bad at games and math.

02:39.260 --> 02:40.626
And comedy."

02:41.661 --> 02:42.528
Here we go.

02:42.530 --> 02:45.297
He was in the TV show <i>Combat</i>
<i>with Vic Morrow.</i>

02:45.299 --> 02:45.931
Rick Jason. Next.

02:45.933 --> 02:47.799
He had a band...
Dave Brubeck. Next.

02:47.801 --> 02:49.735
He was the shortest man
in the...
Michu, next.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.270
He played shortstop
for the Minnesota T...

02:51.272 --> 02:52.704
Roy Smalley!
Roy Smalley.
Roy Smalley.

02:52.706 --> 02:54.439
Time's up.
Ha, ha.

02:54.441 --> 02:56.275
Your turn, ladies.

02:56.277 --> 02:57.709
(sighs)

02:57.711 --> 02:59.711
He's married to Katie Holmes.

03:01.414 --> 03:03.282
He was in <i>Risky Business,</i>

03:03.284 --> 03:06.185
Top Gun, Jerry Maguire
and <i>Rain Man.</i>

03:07.487 --> 03:09.955
Jumped
on Oprah's couch!

03:09.957 --> 03:11.790
You gotta be kidding me.

03:11.792 --> 03:12.958
He's a Scientologist.

03:12.960 --> 03:13.992
KENDRA:
<i>My Name Is Earl?</i>

03:13.994 --> 03:16.028
What the...?
<i>My Name is Earl.</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:17.062
Time's up.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.397
You ladies suck.

03:18.399 --> 03:19.464
"Suck"?

03:19.466 --> 03:20.499
ALL:
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

03:20.501 --> 03:21.033
Whoa-hoa!

03:21.035 --> 03:27.506
[ Speaking Italian ]
"Suck," in this context means,
"to be bad" at the game.

03:27.508 --> 03:28.173
Oh!

03:28.175 --> 03:32.444
Well, I think we've all had
about enough of this game.

03:32.446 --> 03:32.978
Word!

03:32.980 --> 03:34.079
So what do you say, Tim?

03:34.081 --> 03:36.448
How about the boys go
downstairs to the den

03:36.450 --> 03:40.686
while you ladies have a tickle
fight and talk about cupcakes?

03:41.854 --> 03:44.556
I figure you can never
have enough confetti.

03:44.558 --> 03:47.993
So I make my own,
and whenever there's a parade,

03:47.995 --> 03:49.494
I grab a couple of handfuls.

03:49.496 --> 03:51.763
Open that drawer over there.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.332
Take a handful.

03:53.334 --> 03:54.933
Take it home with you.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.703
KENDRA:
Happy New Year's!

04:01.574 --> 04:04.509
That sure was a fun party.

04:04.511 --> 04:05.844
We have good friends.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.779
You have good friends.

04:07.781 --> 04:10.015
What? Is there
something wrong?

04:10.017 --> 04:10.882
(erotic moan)

04:10.884 --> 04:12.150
No, Cleveland.
I'm just tired.

04:12.152 --> 04:15.654
And you can quit jabbing me
'cause I'm going to sleep.

04:15.656 --> 04:17.022
Fine.

04:35.842 --> 04:38.176
Good night, madam.

04:38.178 --> 04:41.013
Oh! Hello, madam!

04:44.450 --> 04:50.088
All right, traps and yappers,
shut 'em down.

04:50.090 --> 04:51.757
Before today's assembly,

04:51.759 --> 04:53.725
I have a few short
announcements.

04:53.727 --> 04:57.562
Despite the best efforts of our
Amnesty International Club,

04:57.564 --> 05:02.067
political prisoner Lopsang Dao
was beheaded last night.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.602
You win some, you lose some.

05:03.604 --> 05:07.806
Also, your nominees for
student council president are...

05:07.808 --> 05:10.208
(warbling,
imitating drumroll)

05:10.210 --> 05:12.744
cool deaf kid
Oliver Wilkerson...

05:12.746 --> 05:14.913
(cheering and applause)
Yeah! I'm gonna win!

05:14.915 --> 05:17.149
And Cleveland Brown, Jr.

05:17.151 --> 05:18.150
(cheering and applause stops)

05:18.152 --> 05:20.652
Huh. Guess I must
be getting popular.

05:20.654 --> 05:24.222
Dude, I nominated
your brother as a joke.

05:24.224 --> 05:25.390
Aw, that's mean.

05:25.392 --> 05:28.060
Can you imagine him
running for president?

05:28.062 --> 05:29.861
I can't imagine
him running.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.897
(guttural laughter)

05:35.435 --> 05:36.968
(doorbell ringing)

05:36.970 --> 05:39.104
I answered it last time.

05:39.106 --> 05:40.172
No, I did.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.440
I don't think so.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.574
Cleveland, remember?

05:42.576 --> 05:43.709
(doorbell ringing)

05:43.711 --> 05:45.544
I'll get it.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.979
(gunshot)

05:47.981 --> 05:49.915
Oh, yeah, you got shot.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.850
I'll get this one.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.185
Hello, Cleveland.

05:53.187 --> 05:57.189
Oh, Donna, a group of us
girls always get together

05:57.191 --> 05:58.190
to watch <i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

05:58.192 --> 06:01.827
and eat Chinese food,
just like Sandra Oh.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.862
Are you free
Thursday night?

06:03.864 --> 06:05.764
Yeah, she's free
Thursday night.

06:05.766 --> 06:06.998
Actually, Cleveland,
I have to...

06:07.000 --> 06:08.033
Oh, I'll put
Rallo to bed.

06:08.035 --> 06:10.469
You go have a great time
with my friends' wives.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.837
Just leave my dinner
in the oven

06:11.839 --> 06:15.640
and my clothes laid out
for the next day before you go.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.809
Good girl.

06:19.011 --> 06:20.979
She is a good girl.

06:28.488 --> 06:30.122
(speed dialing)

06:30.124 --> 06:31.490
Hey, it's me.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.691
I need to see you.

06:32.693 --> 06:34.826
Call me as soon as you can.

06:34.828 --> 06:36.695
I miss you.

06:38.231 --> 06:42.768
Mmm, nobody needs
to see Delta Burke's anus.

06:42.770 --> 06:47.139
But I guess I did look up what
page it was on and turn to it.

06:50.176 --> 06:52.210
Where are you goin'?

06:52.212 --> 06:53.044
It's Thursday.

06:53.046 --> 06:54.813
<i>I'm off to watch</i>
<i>Grey's Anatomy</i>

06:54.815 --> 06:56.314
with Arianna and
the girls, remember?

06:56.316 --> 06:58.617
Oh, that sounds dreadful.

06:58.619 --> 07:00.619
But have fun.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.633
(doorbell rings)

07:19.172 --> 07:23.275
So, now, Donna will be friends
with my friends' wives,

07:23.277 --> 07:25.043
which means
I don't have to choose

07:25.045 --> 07:26.111
between my friends and my wife.

07:26.113 --> 07:29.014
CLEVELAND (falsetto):
Oh. So you're not going
to leave her?

07:29.016 --> 07:31.149
I never said
I was going to leave her.

07:31.151 --> 07:33.718
Well, maybe I'll
tell her about us.

07:33.720 --> 07:34.920
Maybe I'll kill you!

07:34.922 --> 07:39.591
Go ahead. If I can't have you,
I'd rather be dead.

07:39.593 --> 07:41.660
Oh, now don't say th...

07:42.862 --> 07:46.898
Rallo, you are having
a dream.

07:51.571 --> 07:53.338
Hey, Yvette.

07:53.340 --> 07:54.973
There's my girl.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.208
Get your ass in here.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.243
Hey, y'all, it's Donna.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.911
Donna Tubbs?

07:59.913 --> 08:01.213
We haven't seen you in so long,

08:01.215 --> 08:04.082
we thought you'd run off
and found yourself a man.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.017
Do I look like
I've got a husband

08:06.019 --> 08:07.919
and an overweight stepson?
Uh-uh.

08:07.921 --> 08:10.755
Now give me a drink.
It's ladies' night.

08:10.757 --> 08:11.857
(all whooping)

08:11.859 --> 08:13.525
She's back.

08:14.861 --> 08:17.028
Ugh, enough about Robert.

08:17.030 --> 08:17.896
How's your ex?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.866
Girl, we're still fighting
over custody of the kids.

08:20.868 --> 08:23.735
Really?
Yeah, he still wants
me to take 'em.

08:23.737 --> 08:25.804
Ah!
Ah!

08:25.806 --> 08:28.373
(guttural laugh)

08:28.375 --> 08:29.174
Men.

08:29.176 --> 08:31.209
They're only good
for one thing...

08:31.211 --> 08:33.712
Opening jars.
Opening jars.

08:33.846 --> 08:37.582
I haven't had
a pearl onion in years.

08:39.051 --> 08:41.753
Now we don't
need men at all.

08:41.755 --> 08:43.655
(all whooping)

08:43.657 --> 08:45.123
Yes!

08:55.067 --> 08:57.335
Junior, boys
shouldn't be rubbin'

08:57.337 --> 08:59.137
on their dad's butt like...

08:59.139 --> 09:01.106
Ooh, baby, is that you?

09:01.108 --> 09:03.041
(sultrily):
Mm-hmm.

09:03.043 --> 09:03.975
You're in a good mood.

09:03.977 --> 09:06.878
Hey, how was tonight's
episode of <i>Grey's Anatom...</i>

09:06.880 --> 09:10.282
(à la Fletch):
♪ Moon river!

09:12.752 --> 09:14.753
And... go!

09:20.960 --> 09:21.326
8.35.

09:21.328 --> 09:24.195
Aah! I'll never make it
out of the ghetto.

09:24.197 --> 09:27.032
Hey fellas, check out
my new campaign poster.

09:27.034 --> 09:30.468
My slogan is,
"What can Brown do for you?"

09:30.470 --> 09:35.173
You should change that slogan
to "Yes, we canned ham."

09:35.175 --> 09:36.408
(laughing)

09:36.410 --> 09:39.177
I wouldn't be laughing
if I was you.

09:39.179 --> 09:40.278
As far as anyone's concerned,

09:40.280 --> 09:42.147
you're just Junior's
little brother.

09:42.149 --> 09:45.016
If he's a big loser,
you're a big loser.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.152
Aw, Jiminy Christmas,
you're right.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.888
I'm gonna be judged
by what my brother does.

09:49.890 --> 09:52.791
Just like those brothers
who made <i>The Matrix.</i>

09:52.793 --> 09:55.660
So, you have a vagina?

09:55.662 --> 09:58.763
No, that's my brother.

09:59.732 --> 10:00.732
Chins up, Tubby.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.133
I'm your new
campaign manager.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.803
Thanks, but I don't need
a campaign manager.

10:04.805 --> 10:08.006
The school newspaper
begs to differ.

10:08.741 --> 10:09.941
Listen up...

10:09.943 --> 10:11.676
<i>...first,</i>
<i>let's talk demographics.</i>

10:11.678 --> 10:14.279
<i>Oliver's got the "cool kid"</i>
<i>vote locked up.</i>

10:14.281 --> 10:16.314
<i>But that's only three</i>
<i>percent of the school.</i>

10:16.316 --> 10:19.317
<i>We're gonna target</i>
<i>your base: the losers.</i>

10:19.319 --> 10:21.319
<i>I'm talking about the nerds...</i>

10:21.321 --> 10:22.487
<i>the band geeks...</i>

10:22.489 --> 10:24.155
<i>the exchange students...</i>

10:24.157 --> 10:25.223
<i>the special ed kids...</i>

10:25.225 --> 10:27.459
<i>...and the teen moms.</i>
<i>(baby crying)</i>

10:27.461 --> 10:30.695
(baby laughing and cooing)

10:31.831 --> 10:34.132
Now we gotta put you
on the attack.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.368
I don't want to do
anything hurtful.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.236
Well, okay, John Kerry.

10:38.238 --> 10:39.871
Tell me what I gotta do.

10:39.873 --> 10:41.072
All right, first thing:

10:41.074 --> 10:42.941
what are Oliver's
greatest strengths?

10:42.943 --> 10:44.943
He's captain
of the football team.

10:44.945 --> 10:46.311
Otherwise known as...

10:46.313 --> 10:48.980
He's also very handsome.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.749
Therefore...

10:50.751 --> 10:53.051
But he does well
with the ladies.

10:53.053 --> 10:57.055
Oh, so we turn his strengths
into weaknesses.

10:57.057 --> 10:58.323
Now you're getting it.

10:58.325 --> 10:59.891
Wow, you're smart.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.292
Say it as a weakness.

11:01.294 --> 11:02.260
I'm a...

11:02.262 --> 11:04.863
- Nerd.
- Jew... nerd.

11:07.299 --> 11:10.368
Who had the fried chicken
in the bread bucket?

11:10.370 --> 11:12.470
I'll give you one guess.

11:12.472 --> 11:13.805
Right here, dude.

11:13.807 --> 11:14.873
You know who would enjoy this?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.510
Donna. But there was a flood
at the school library.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.813
She sure came home happy
after your TV night.

11:21.815 --> 11:23.448
So happy that she tickled my--

11:23.450 --> 11:27.452
what the Native Americans call--
"maize hole."

11:27.454 --> 11:28.920
She didn't come to our TV night.

11:28.922 --> 11:32.190
She called and said she was
feeling under the weather.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.091
Wait a minute.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.459
That don't add up.
That's queer.

11:34.461 --> 11:36.961
If she wasn't with you,
where'd she go that night?

11:36.963 --> 11:41.266
That, my friend,
is the $25,000 Pyramid.

11:41.268 --> 11:45.970
(mysteriously):
Where is she tonight?

11:45.972 --> 11:49.407
I haven't worked up an
under-boob sweat like this

11:49.409 --> 11:50.075
in a long time!

11:50.077 --> 11:53.011
I hope you're not going to miss
the big cookout on Saturday.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.979
Oh, I'll be there.

11:54.981 --> 11:57.415
Uh-oh, Oreo alert.

11:57.417 --> 11:59.284
Cream filling, anyone?

11:59.286 --> 12:01.453
(slaps bottoms)

12:02.822 --> 12:04.189
(screaming)

12:04.191 --> 12:05.156
Yvette, what did you--

12:05.158 --> 12:06.291
Oh, you didn't mean

12:06.293 --> 12:07.292
the stab-in-the-hand thing?

12:07.294 --> 12:08.860
Well, you got to say
"drink-in-the-face"

12:08.862 --> 12:11.329
if you mean "drink-in-the-face"!

12:11.331 --> 12:13.164
(women laughing)

12:13.166 --> 12:14.332
Oh...

12:14.334 --> 12:15.300
Are you okay, sir?

12:15.302 --> 12:17.669
Hell, yeah!
Now I can just do my hand.

12:17.671 --> 12:23.108

12:26.645 --> 12:28.246

12:30.417 --> 12:32.550
Oh. Hello, Mrs. Brown.

12:32.552 --> 12:34.419
How was your evening?

12:34.421 --> 12:36.121
(slowly):
Fun.

12:36.123 --> 12:36.788
(chuckles softly)

12:36.790 --> 12:41.025
Restocking the water-damaged
books at the library was fun?

12:41.027 --> 12:42.060
What?

12:42.062 --> 12:44.195
(gasps)
Oh, yeah!

12:44.197 --> 12:45.497
Ha! Busted.

12:45.499 --> 12:46.698
Where were you the other night

12:46.700 --> 12:49.267

We've made up a lot of ground,
but we've hit a wall.

13:00.580 --> 13:01.980
But if we go
any more negative,

13:01.982 --> 13:05.250
it's just going to look like
we're picking on the deaf kid.

13:05.252 --> 13:07.218
Well, then what
are we going to do to him?

13:07.220 --> 13:11.623
It's not what we do to him,

13:11.625 --> 13:13.324
it's what we do to you.

13:13.326 --> 13:16.761
We're going to fight fire
with fire.

13:18.898 --> 13:20.532
Blind man walking!

13:20.534 --> 13:21.399
He went blind?

13:21.401 --> 13:23.701
It's called
"macular degeneration."

13:23.703 --> 13:25.069
Look it up. It's a thing.

13:25.071 --> 13:28.106
Oh, my God! Is there
anything we can do to help?

13:28.108 --> 13:29.374
A vote would help.

13:29.376 --> 13:30.975
You've got it.

13:32.378 --> 13:34.579
Kind of puts it all in
perspective, doesn't it?

13:34.581 --> 13:37.582
I know.
Can you imagine being blind?

13:37.584 --> 13:39.017
GUY:
And black.

It's a beautiful morning.

13:46.560 --> 13:48.126
And you know
what that means?

13:48.128 --> 13:50.295
(singsongy):
It's river time!

Tubin'?

Tubin'?!

13:54.100 --> 13:57.402
Tubin' down the river!
Where's your mother?

13:57.404 --> 13:58.703
Oh, she left you a note.

13:58.705 --> 14:00.705
DONNA:
<i>Dearest Cleveland,</i>

14:00.707 --> 14:02.207
<i>if you are reading this,</i>

14:02.209 --> 14:03.341

14:03.343 --> 14:04.676
<i>to read the note</i>
<i>on the refrigerator.</i>

14:04.678 --> 14:06.978

14:09.049 --> 14:09.647
<i>XOXO.</i>

14:09.649 --> 14:11.349
I don't know
what's going on with her.

14:11.351 --> 14:14.352
She's acting more suspicious
than my podiatrist.

14:14.354 --> 14:18.556
Are you sure this is
a necessary part of the exam?

14:18.558 --> 14:19.524
(sucking)

14:19.526 --> 14:20.491
Nope.

14:20.493 --> 14:22.026
(sucking)

14:24.997 --> 14:26.731
Junior, give me a beer.

14:26.733 --> 14:28.099
What?

14:28.101 --> 14:29.133
(wailing)

14:29.135 --> 14:31.469
Did that wash the crap
out of your ears?

14:31.471 --> 14:33.338
I said, "Get me a beer"!

14:33.340 --> 14:35.540
(laughing)

14:37.409 --> 14:39.544
Ah, we're tubin'.

What? What are
you looking at?

14:50.122 --> 14:52.090
What the...?!
Donna!

14:52.092 --> 14:53.091
Cleveland!

14:53.093 --> 14:54.359
Who's Cleveland?

14:54.361 --> 14:55.660
Her husband!

Husband?!

15:06.639 --> 15:10.108
You really saved our skin,
Mr. Flippers.

15:10.110 --> 15:11.075
Sure did!

15:11.077 --> 15:12.744
See you later, peoples!

15:12.746 --> 15:15.079
Stay dry!

15:18.217 --> 15:20.652
ALL:
Thank you, Mr. Flippers!

15:20.654 --> 15:24.956
Hmm. "Emergency
at school," huh?

15:29.728 --> 15:31.362
You've been lying
to me, Donna.

15:31.364 --> 15:33.698
Who were those women
you were with at the river?!

15:33.700 --> 15:35.066
They're my single friends.

15:35.068 --> 15:37.869
They have this group
where they talk trash about men

15:37.871 --> 15:39.737
while desperately trying
to find one.

15:39.739 --> 15:42.073
And if they found out
I got married,

15:42.075 --> 15:43.374
they wouldn't want me around.

15:43.376 --> 15:45.710
Oh, God forbid
you get kicked out

15:45.712 --> 15:47.412
of the man-hating bitch group.

15:47.414 --> 15:49.380
How dare you
call them bitches!

15:49.382 --> 15:51.683
You're the one
acting like a bitch.

15:51.685 --> 15:53.518
Un-uh! I'm serious.

15:53.520 --> 15:55.987
Well, you have fun
with your single friends.

15:55.989 --> 15:57.355
I'll have fun with mine.

15:57.357 --> 16:01.059
Girl, you will not believe
what she just said to me.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.093
I wish she would!

16:02.095 --> 16:03.428
(snaps fingers)

16:06.298 --> 16:08.466

16:10.569 --> 16:13.071

16:14.807 --> 16:17.175

16:20.145 --> 16:22.380

16:25.384 --> 16:27.418
Do you still love me?

16:27.420 --> 16:29.253
'Course I do.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.388
What is that smell?!

16:30.390 --> 16:34.692
Holt's vomit, Terry's
vomit, my vomit.

16:34.694 --> 16:36.094
Vomit.

16:36.096 --> 16:37.829
Single life makes me sick.

16:37.831 --> 16:41.332
Oh, honey, I'm so sorry
I lied to you.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.701
But Yvette and the girls
were there for me

16:43.703 --> 16:44.669
when Robert and I split.

16:44.671 --> 16:47.372
They made me feel strong
when I was weak.

16:47.374 --> 16:50.274
Listen, I'm the one
who should be sorry.

16:50.276 --> 16:54.679
I have my friends, and you
should be free to choose yours.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.681
Well,
now they don't want me back

16:56.683 --> 16:59.317
because I lied to them
about being married,

16:59.319 --> 17:01.519
and because I am married.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.156
CLEVELAND:
<i>I wish I could help Donna.</i>

17:05.158 --> 17:08.159
<i>Oh, oh, it feels good to pee.</i>

17:08.161 --> 17:09.160
<i>Mm.</i>

17:09.162 --> 17:10.261

17:10.263 --> 17:11.095
All right.

17:11.097 --> 17:13.698
He's deaf. He's blind.

17:13.700 --> 17:15.666
And for the next 40 minutes,

17:15.668 --> 17:18.336
I need you all to be mute.

17:18.338 --> 17:21.606
Each candidate
gets one minute to respond.

17:21.608 --> 17:23.374
When I ring this bell--

17:23.376 --> 17:25.743
and for you, Oliver,
when I do this:

17:25.745 --> 17:28.613
"Hey, Oliver!"--

17:28.615 --> 17:31.649
it means your time is almost up.

17:31.651 --> 17:32.383
Cleveland Jr.,

17:32.385 --> 17:34.685
you may start
with your opening statement.

17:34.687 --> 17:35.720
Good afternoon.

17:35.722 --> 17:37.588
At least I think it's afternoon.

17:37.590 --> 17:40.391
I-I'm not sure
because I'm blind.

17:40.393 --> 17:42.493
But though I may
have lost my sight,

17:42.495 --> 17:44.429
I still see a
better future.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.330
I've spent
the last several weeks

17:46.332 --> 17:48.466
walking these halls
and hearing your stories.

17:48.468 --> 17:52.203
From the exchange student
who can't understand anything

17:52.205 --> 17:54.205
because he "no speaky English,"

17:54.207 --> 17:55.907
to the special needs kids,

17:55.909 --> 17:58.543
whose lunchtime antics
entertain us all,

17:58.545 --> 18:03.014
to Ryan Sanderson, who told me
that he was too afraid

18:03.016 --> 18:05.483
to tell everyone
that he was gay...

18:05.485 --> 18:06.217
Oh, please.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.186
These are the colors
of the quilt

18:08.188 --> 18:10.154
that is Stoolbend High.

18:10.156 --> 18:11.189
(scattered applause)

18:11.191 --> 18:15.259
(over-enunciating):
Oliver, you're up!

18:15.261 --> 18:17.628
Read... my... lips.

18:17.630 --> 18:21.232
I am captain
of the football team,

18:21.234 --> 18:23.701
(creaking)
3.8 GPA...

18:23.703 --> 18:27.338
...future Deaf Businessman
of America,

wink, wink...

Whoa!

18:32.278 --> 18:34.412
(all gasping)

18:34.414 --> 18:35.947
Hey! He can see!

18:35.949 --> 18:38.316
Uh... It's a miracle!

18:38.318 --> 18:40.585
(all murmuring happily)

18:40.587 --> 18:42.954
You saved my life!

18:42.956 --> 18:45.556
I can't run
against you.

18:45.558 --> 18:47.859
I'm dropping
out of the race!

18:47.861 --> 18:50.628
(tauntingly):
Quitter, quitter, quitter!

18:50.630 --> 18:52.130
Ah, he can't hear me.

18:52.132 --> 18:52.663
Ladies and gentlemen,

18:52.665 --> 18:56.300
I present your new
student council president,

19:09.581 --> 19:12.850
Congratulations,
Mr. President.

19:12.852 --> 19:13.718
Thanks, Rallo.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.187
I couldn't have
done it without you.

19:16.189 --> 19:16.787
So, what now?

19:16.789 --> 19:19.624
That's for you
to decide. Me?

19:19.626 --> 19:21.592
I'm getting out of the game.

19:21.594 --> 19:25.463
But we did something here,
didn't we?

19:27.399 --> 19:29.667
We did something.

19:37.609 --> 19:40.311
Thank you for taking me
out to dinner, Cleveland.

19:40.313 --> 19:41.679
What a nice surprise.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.615
This night's going
to be full of surprises.

19:44.617 --> 19:45.449
Now, you head
to the table.

19:45.451 --> 19:48.586
I'm gonna go publicly brush
my teeth in the men's room

19:48.588 --> 19:50.421
and make everyone
uncomfortable.

19:50.423 --> 19:53.858
And I said, "I don't even want
to know whose hair this is.

19:53.860 --> 19:56.561
Just weave it
into my damn head."

19:56.563 --> 19:58.396
(laughing)

19:58.398 --> 19:59.797
Well, well, well.

19:59.799 --> 20:02.800
If it isn't Miss
"I'm gonna raise my kids

20:02.802 --> 20:04.835
in a stable,
two-parent household."

20:04.837 --> 20:06.504
Yvette,
I'm sorry I lied to...

20:06.506 --> 20:09.006
Here I am
with my two favorite hos.

20:09.008 --> 20:12.710
I sure hope my wife
doesn't find out about...

20:12.712 --> 20:13.945
Uh-oh!

20:13.947 --> 20:14.779
Cleveland?!

20:14.781 --> 20:16.414
(woodenly):
My wife, Donna.

20:16.416 --> 20:17.748
What are you doing here?

20:17.750 --> 20:20.084
What am I?
What are <i>you</i> doing?

20:20.086 --> 20:21.485
I'll tell you what I'm doing.

20:21.487 --> 20:26.457
I'm leaving you high and dry,
you stupid female.

20:26.459 --> 20:28.359
Who are you calling stupid?

20:28.361 --> 20:28.926
Dummy over here.

20:28.928 --> 20:31.829
As a matter of fact,
all of y'all are stupid.

20:31.831 --> 20:34.498
You're stupid.
You're stupid.

20:34.500 --> 20:38.002
You're probably good at math,
but stupid in other areas.

20:38.004 --> 20:43.307
And you, like the first two,
are also stupid, too.

20:43.309 --> 20:44.242
Stupid.

20:44.244 --> 20:44.875
Come on, Donna.

20:44.877 --> 20:47.712
This piece of trash
doesn't deserve you.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.613
How am I doing?

20:48.615 --> 20:50.014
You got your friends
back, right?

20:50.016 --> 20:52.049
Cleveland, you didn't
have to do this.

20:52.051 --> 20:54.652
I don't need them
when I've got you.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.020
You can have both.

20:56.022 --> 20:57.688
See you at home later.

20:57.690 --> 20:58.723
Don't forget a doggie bag.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.626
And don't worry,
I'll use a condom.

21:01.628 --> 21:03.928
- What?
- I love you.
