BARNUM:
McLanahan, I told you
to get rid of him.

43:44.350 --> 43:46.580
Wasn't my fault.
He didn't respect
my authority.

43:46.780 --> 43:47.850
Why'd you call off
the search?

43:48.050 --> 43:49.980
'Cause I didn't find
a damn thing.So?

43:50.180 --> 43:51.850
Keep looking.I did.

43:52.050 --> 43:54.680
Okay, I had five helicopters
in the air all afternoon.

43:54.880 --> 43:56.070
Do you know
how much that cost me?

43:56.270 --> 43:58.680
Half my budget
for the year.So what?

43:58.880 --> 44:00.030
You think I made it up.

gonna listen
to him?

44:21.120 --> 44:23.530
You think I'd shoot myself
in the leg with an arrow?

44:23.730 --> 44:25.060
An arrow makes
a clean wound.

44:25.260 --> 44:27.670
Even the doctor
said your leg
was all messed up.

I told you.Right.

McLANAHAN:
You know, Pickett,

44:34.920 --> 44:38.770
maybe you were just
thrown from your horse
like a jackass

44:38.970 --> 44:41.420
and landed
on a real sharp stick.

44:41.620 --> 44:44.730
Then maybe you were just
too embarrassed to admit
that you messed up,

44:44.930 --> 44:46.640
and concocted
this whole thing

44:46.840 --> 44:49.420
so that you sounded
like a hero.

So why don't you
just go home
and get some rest.
