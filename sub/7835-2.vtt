01:23.709 --> 01:26.252
Won't you marry me, Bill?

01:26.587 --> 01:29.213
I got the wedding gown bill

01:29.923 --> 01:32.258
Because weddings are nice

01:33.469 --> 01:35.261
Let's never miss the school bus again.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.556
That was The 5th Dimension
with Weddings are Nice.

01:38.640 --> 01:39.724
You know what else is nice, Marty?

01:39.808 --> 01:40.850
What's that, Bill?

01:40.934 --> 01:43.561
The KBBL Prize Posse!

01:43.854 --> 01:45.354
Damn dirty ape!

01:45.939 --> 01:49.984
If our Wampum Wagon spots
your KBBL Party Penguin,

01:50.068 --> 01:52.528
you'll win $40!

01:53.489 --> 01:56.365
Did you hear that, Pengy? $40!

01:56.784 --> 01:58.993
Hey! There's the Wampum Wagon!

02:01.205 --> 02:03.080
End of the line, boys!

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
Look out, because it's zooming!

02:07.336 --> 02:10.838
If we're late for school, we'll
miss our free federal breakfast!

02:10.923 --> 02:13.466
Big deal. It's just
saltines and fig paste.

02:13.550 --> 02:15.927
Ew! Saltines!

02:24.102 --> 02:27.647
Hey, Cora. I heard science
is working on a donut

02:27.731 --> 02:30.274
that actually burns off calories.

02:30.359 --> 02:32.318
How's that going? What?

02:32.653 --> 02:35.863
Never mind. Just refill
this with jelly, will you?

02:38.408 --> 02:39.450
Thanks. You're an angel.

02:39.535 --> 02:40.535
What?

02:41.119 --> 02:43.663
Hey, check it out. Wiggum's cruiser.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.834
Wow! Tear gas, riot club, police hat.

02:47.918 --> 02:49.585
With rain baggy!

02:49.670 --> 02:52.672
Oh, man. That would
really keep your head dry.

02:53.715 --> 02:55.508
Have you ever been in a police car?

02:55.592 --> 02:56.676
Not in the front.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.804
Hey, I just had this crazy idea!

02:59.888 --> 03:01.389
Really? What?

03:02.558 --> 03:06.018
What's this thing? "Miranda
Rights Teleprompter. "

03:08.605 --> 03:09.856
Check this out!

03:09.940 --> 03:11.649
You there! Put your hands up!

03:11.733 --> 03:13.401
Me? Okay.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.444
Now, drop your pants.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.697
Yeah, but... But my hands are up.

03:17.781 --> 03:19.282
Hula out of them.

03:19.366 --> 03:20.783
All right, Officer.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.252
What the heck is going on out there?

03:31.712 --> 03:34.964
Officer Sniffy? Come in,
Sniffy. Do you read me?

03:35.299 --> 03:36.424
It's me, Clancy.

03:37.634 --> 03:38.801
No! Get away!

03:40.095 --> 03:41.137
Uh-oh.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.890
Hey, somebody's stealing my car! What?

03:45.893 --> 03:46.934
Look out!

03:48.103 --> 03:49.520
Soup! Soup!

03:55.152 --> 03:58.237
That's why you young
athletes are so promising.

03:59.114 --> 04:01.324
Now, who'd like to buy a trophy?

04:09.791 --> 04:11.834
Finally, some recognition.

04:14.338 --> 04:16.964
All right. You two are
under arrest for joyriding.

04:17.048 --> 04:19.341
You have the right to remain, um...

04:19.927 --> 04:21.135
Uh...

04:21.219 --> 04:23.638
Silent? That doesn't sound right.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.976
I love our court days.

04:29.144 --> 04:31.854
It's about the only thing
we do as a family anymore.

04:32.147 --> 04:34.023
Hey, Karie. Hey, Lisa.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.569
Your Honor, please don't
send my son to juvie.

04:38.654 --> 04:40.821
He's basically a good
kid. He's just weak.

04:41.156 --> 04:43.324
Morally and in the upper body.

04:43.408 --> 04:44.492
Hmm.

04:44.576 --> 04:47.203
Please let me slip through the cracks.

04:47.579 --> 04:51.123
Well, you look like a good
student, what with those glasses,

04:51.208 --> 04:54.877
and I suppose boys will
be boys. Case dismissed.

04:56.421 --> 04:58.547
Good old Judge Snyder.

04:58.799 --> 05:01.467
Next defendant, Bartholomew J. Simpson.

05:01.551 --> 05:03.344
Well, show time.

05:06.431 --> 05:10.101
Why, hello, Bart. Say,
are those new shoes?

05:10.519 --> 05:11.978
Yes, they are, Roy.

05:12.062 --> 05:13.813
Judge Snyder? While we're young?

05:13.939 --> 05:16.482
Oh. Sorry. Oh, my.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.027
Looks like you were the
ringleader in this car theft!

05:20.112 --> 05:21.404
And that's a felony!

05:21.488 --> 05:22.738
Yes, sir.

05:23.782 --> 05:26.993
On the other hand, I was young once.

05:27.077 --> 05:28.327
I'll bring the car around.

05:28.412 --> 05:30.079
And I suppose boys will be...

05:30.163 --> 05:33.499
Oops. My vacation just started.

05:36.962 --> 05:40.089
All rise for the Honorable
Judge Constance Harm.

05:45.220 --> 05:46.387
Uh-oh.

05:46.805 --> 05:48.389
Silence in my courtroom!

05:50.434 --> 05:52.059
Grand theft auto?

05:52.144 --> 05:53.728
It was an accident, ma'am.

05:54.104 --> 05:56.772
Don't spit on my cupcake
and tell me it's frosting.

05:57.607 --> 05:59.984
What did she say about cupcakes?

06:00.110 --> 06:03.696
According to this, your father
was driving you to school?

06:03.822 --> 06:06.365
Then where was he when
you stole the police car?

06:06.450 --> 06:10.619
Your Honor, I was chasing the
KBBL Party Penguin Prize Patrol.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.372
You abandoned your son to win $40?

06:13.457 --> 06:17.626
And a Blue Oyster Cult medallion. Cool.

06:17.919 --> 06:20.171
And that was more important than
keeping your son out of trouble?

06:20.255 --> 06:23.758
Your Honor, if I may sing a little
bit of Don't Fear the Reaper,

06:23.842 --> 06:24.967
I think you'll agree that...

06:25.052 --> 06:26.802
I'm familiar with B.O.C.

06:26.887 --> 06:31.140
But you have got a boy here who is
crying out for adult supervision!

06:31.391 --> 06:32.808
I couldn't agree more.

06:32.893 --> 06:36.228
Perhaps some sort of court-appointed
babysitter or "au pair. "

06:36.313 --> 06:38.314
Sorry, bub. That crow won't caw.

06:38.398 --> 06:39.607
It won't?

06:39.691 --> 06:42.276
I hereby order you to
be tethered to your son!

06:42.360 --> 06:43.861
Tethered? Tethered.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.237
Report to room five.

06:45.322 --> 06:46.405
Room five?

06:51.703 --> 06:53.662
There we go. How's that?

06:54.331 --> 06:55.748
It's a little tight.

06:55.832 --> 06:58.584
Sir, you are not a size four.

06:58.668 --> 07:00.169
I used to be.

07:12.265 --> 07:14.266
This punishment is so cruel.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.851
And unusual.

07:16.186 --> 07:17.937
Can that judge do this to us?

07:18.021 --> 07:20.314
Creative sentencing
is common these days.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.691
That's why Bill Clinton
is our new mailman.

07:24.528 --> 07:26.070
Dang magazines.

07:26.530 --> 07:30.533
Well, maybe it'll be fun. You'll
get to spend more time together.

07:30.700 --> 07:33.577
Make sure your father
takes his mood medication.

07:33.662 --> 07:38.541
I'll medicate you... Honey.
You know, this could be fun.

07:38.959 --> 07:40.876
Race you to the kitchen,
my little tether ball.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.461
You're on,
Rope-a-Dope!

07:45.674 --> 07:49.301
Today we're going to talk about
predicates and predicate nominatives.

07:49.386 --> 07:50.553
Boring!

07:50.637 --> 07:53.764
Mr. Simpson, I'm trying to teach.

07:53.849 --> 07:56.142
Come on. These kids are
never gonna use that stuff.

07:56.226 --> 07:57.977
Will you please just go back to sleep?

07:58.061 --> 07:59.478
Fine.

08:05.360 --> 08:06.485
All right, now, who can pick out

08:06.570 --> 08:08.154
the predicate in this sentence?

08:10.782 --> 08:12.950
What's wrong with him now, Bart?

08:13.034 --> 08:14.410
Night terrors, ma'am.

08:15.287 --> 08:16.287
Cobras!

08:17.747 --> 08:19.748
Okay, Son, concentrate.

08:19.833 --> 08:23.210
Shut out everything but
the sound of my criticism.

08:24.838 --> 08:26.005
Swing!

08:28.300 --> 08:31.594
Hey, hey! Run, Bart! Pump your thighs!

08:32.095 --> 08:33.554
Pump them!

08:33.638 --> 08:35.014
Hurry up, Dad!

08:35.849 --> 08:37.474
I'm with you, Son.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.152
Safe! Wow. My first home run.

08:49.112 --> 08:50.738
That's my boy.

08:52.073 --> 08:53.782
Come on, hug me.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.206
Cobras! Cobras!

09:05.295 --> 09:08.797
I thought I would hate working
nights, but it's so peaceful.

09:08.882 --> 09:12.343
And there's no one here to
squeal on me for shooting mice.

09:12.469 --> 09:14.470
Can I ask you something, Dad? Sure, boy.

09:14.554 --> 09:15.888
The town keeps getting bigger.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.224
Will there always be enough electricity?

09:20.727 --> 09:23.604
Oh, Son, you know that's
none of your business.

09:24.314 --> 09:26.273
Say, is that our house?

09:26.358 --> 09:28.525
Uh, I don't think our
house has a steeple.

09:28.777 --> 09:32.988
Yeah. I forget things sometimes.

09:36.159 --> 09:38.577
Really? You like skateboards?

09:38.662 --> 09:41.205
Mmm-hmm. We're sure learning
a lot about each other.

09:41.456 --> 09:43.165
Yeah. This tether has some pluses.

09:45.669 --> 09:48.879
My head! I need a beer.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.425
I hit my head, Moe.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.677
One beer, coming up.

09:56.846 --> 09:58.430
Hey, hey, no kids in the bar!

09:58.515 --> 09:59.515
Since when?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.309
The heat's been on since
them Bush girls were in here.

10:02.602 --> 10:05.437
All right, all right. Come on, Bart.

10:09.359 --> 10:11.068
I'm cold and scared.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.028
That's my little slugger.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.364
Come on, Dad. Let's go.

10:16.032 --> 10:19.868
Hey, knock it off!
These pants cost $600.

10:19.953 --> 10:20.953
Really?

10:21.037 --> 10:22.162
Yeah. They're Italian.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.415
All right, hand them over.

10:24.499 --> 10:25.708
Moe, what the...

10:25.792 --> 10:26.959
Yeah, I rob now.

10:27.502 --> 10:28.961
There's a new judge in town

10:29.045 --> 10:31.797
with a hard-nosed
approach to juvenile crime.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.882
Punish the parents.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.636
It's about time. Oh.

10:37.721 --> 10:39.722
Kids are running wild, Kent.

10:39.806 --> 10:42.016
And I blame Mr. and Mrs. Neverspank.

10:42.100 --> 10:44.518
Uh-oh. We'll have to bleep their names.

10:44.602 --> 10:48.272
You'll bleep nothing. Parents,
it's time to take control.

10:48.690 --> 10:51.400
If you can't cope, you'll wear the rope.

10:52.068 --> 10:54.403
Well, you can tell she's never had kids.

10:54.529 --> 10:56.989
Look how high and firm her breasts are.

10:57.198 --> 10:58.657
Granted. But you gotta admit,

10:58.742 --> 11:01.118
constant supervision
has been good for Bart.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.745
He might even make the honor roll,

11:02.829 --> 11:05.205
if Dad can control his night terrors.

11:05.290 --> 11:07.374
Well, that's a pretty big if, honey.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.793
Come on, Dad. I gotta
go to the bathroom.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.338
I just got comfortable. Use the bottle.

11:12.505 --> 11:16.592
No! I don't want you going in
a bottle. That's what hobos do.

11:16.968 --> 11:18.177
Come on, Homer.

11:18.261 --> 11:19.303
No.

11:19.387 --> 11:20.429
Mom!

11:20.555 --> 11:23.599
Oh, geez. Homer, just
take him to the bathroom.

11:23.725 --> 11:26.643
Fine! I don't know why
we even have a bottle!

11:26.978 --> 11:28.437
Somebody tell me!

11:34.611 --> 11:37.529
Would you mind? I'm
trying to do my homework.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.782
Son, it's a little chilly.

11:39.908 --> 11:42.618
Maybe you should wrap a
blanket around your head.

11:43.161 --> 11:44.995
Homie, no. We can't.

11:45.080 --> 11:47.539
What's the... What's the big deal?

11:47.624 --> 11:50.542
He sees a thousand times
worse on that Animal Channel!

11:50.627 --> 11:55.172
I don't want him to see
us... Expressing our love.

11:55.673 --> 11:58.175
Why not? Kids are
very visual these days!

11:58.259 --> 11:59.426
No! But...

11:59.511 --> 12:01.053
The lady said no.

12:01.137 --> 12:02.304
Hey, shut up.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.680
You shut up.

12:03.765 --> 12:04.765
Ow!

12:05.058 --> 12:06.600
Why, you...

12:06.684 --> 12:07.810
What'd you do that for?

12:07.894 --> 12:09.103
Because I... Ow!

12:09.187 --> 12:10.604
You... Ow!

12:10.688 --> 12:11.980
Ah! Ow!

12:12.315 --> 12:13.565
Oh, yeah?

12:14.567 --> 12:16.693
I'm sleeping in the bathtub.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.196
Why, you little...

12:22.033 --> 12:24.368
Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:24.994 --> 12:27.538
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

12:28.456 --> 12:29.623
That really hurt.

12:30.583 --> 12:32.626
I can't take it anymore!

12:36.256 --> 12:38.590
Mom, you cut the tether.

12:38.675 --> 12:41.510
We're free! Your mother set us free!

12:43.304 --> 12:44.680
Woo-hoo!

12:44.764 --> 12:46.265
Don't celebrate too much.

12:46.349 --> 12:47.683
Hey, what...

12:47.767 --> 12:49.268
Who said that?

12:50.562 --> 12:52.938
That's right. It's me, Judge Harm,

12:53.022 --> 12:55.107
through the magic of fiber optics.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.276
Hey, how about that?

12:57.360 --> 13:00.737
Quiet, Tubsy! You violated my order.

13:00.822 --> 13:03.115
But Constance, it only
happened because...

13:03.199 --> 13:07.119
Hey, hey, if I want a cock and
bull story, I'll read Hemingway.

13:08.121 --> 13:11.290
Don't be mad at Homer. I
was the one who cut the rope.

13:11.374 --> 13:13.000
Are you threatening me with that knife?

13:13.084 --> 13:14.084
No!

13:14.169 --> 13:16.211
Wait. I'm to blame, Judge.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.755
You see, I was pressuring my wife

13:18.840 --> 13:20.632
to make love in front of our son,

13:20.717 --> 13:23.427
you're gonna laugh when you
hear this, when suddenly...

13:25.722 --> 13:27.306
Well, I thought Dad was the problem,

13:27.390 --> 13:30.184
but apparently Mom is
no prize pig herself.

13:30.768 --> 13:32.478
It's a miracle poor Bartholomew isn't

13:32.562 --> 13:34.813
robbing banks and chasing sweet Lady H.

13:34.898 --> 13:36.482
I'm a latchkey kid.

13:36.566 --> 13:37.774
You are not!

13:37.942 --> 13:39.067
Quiet, little girl!

13:40.278 --> 13:42.654
You two need to wake
up and smell the java,

13:42.739 --> 13:45.616
and the first step is to
admit that you're bad parents.

13:45.700 --> 13:48.410
I admit it. Homer, no.
We're not bad parents.

13:48.495 --> 13:50.704
Yes, you are! Just say it!

13:50.788 --> 13:54.416
No, I won't! And frankly,
Judge, I think you're a bully!

13:54.709 --> 13:56.084
You do, huh?

13:57.295 --> 14:00.756
You're so busy thinking up
crazy ways to punish people,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.800
you can't see how much I love my kids.

14:04.594 --> 14:06.553
Your Honor, I'd like
to be tried separately.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.598
I don't mean to be
disrespectful, Judge Harm,

14:09.724 --> 14:12.100
but we are not bad parents,

14:12.227 --> 14:14.019
and there isn't a tether in this world

14:14.103 --> 14:17.147
with enough fiber optics
to make me say we are.

14:17.857 --> 14:18.982
Hmm.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.320
She's such a butthole.

14:29.911 --> 14:32.287
Sorry! Just... Just let me get...

14:32.372 --> 14:33.580
Ow!

14:41.005 --> 14:42.506
Damn it!

14:42.590 --> 14:44.049
Poor Mom and Dad.

14:44.926 --> 14:47.386
Do you think it's fair that
you're always getting into trouble

14:47.470 --> 14:49.388
yet Mom and Dad are being punished?

14:49.472 --> 14:51.265
No, it's terrible.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.851
Well, why don't you
do something about it?

14:54.936 --> 14:55.978
After wrestling.

14:56.062 --> 14:59.106
Ladies and gentlemen, I don't
believe what I am seeing.

14:59.190 --> 15:02.025
Doctor Bonebreak just
married Rumble-lina,

15:02.151 --> 15:04.736
and they're already
whaling on each other!

15:04.821 --> 15:08.782
When are you gonna start taking
responsibility for your actions?

15:09.117 --> 15:10.242
'Cause I felt like it.

15:10.326 --> 15:11.910
You're not even listening.

15:11.995 --> 15:14.204
I know you are, but what am I?

15:16.874 --> 15:19.167
Haven't we been humiliated enough?

15:19.252 --> 15:20.586
Not yet, no.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.254
Today the judge wants you to bend over

15:22.338 --> 15:24.423
so people can spank you from their cars.

15:24.507 --> 15:26.008
Well, that explains the sign.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.427
Yeah! Ooh! Here comes a car.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.971
Yarr, ye scurvy dogs!

15:31.055 --> 15:32.055
Ow! Ow!

15:32.140 --> 15:33.849
Worst parents ever!

15:34.350 --> 15:35.350
Ha-ha!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.061
Hey! No extension cords!

15:40.231 --> 15:41.940
You know, we could get
out of these stupid things

15:42.025 --> 15:44.276
if you'd just tell the
judge you're a bad mother.

15:44.360 --> 15:46.028
And you don't even have to say "bad. "

15:46.112 --> 15:49.948
It could be "negligent" or
"unfit" or "drugged up. "

15:50.033 --> 15:52.492
I just can't do that, Homer.

15:52.910 --> 15:57.372
It's a matter of principle, and
I need you to support me in this.

16:02.545 --> 16:06.214
You're right. It's time to stand
up to that firm-breasted judge.

16:06.341 --> 16:09.426
But first, we've gotta
break out of these stocks.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.722
Easy. Easy.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.307
I want goggles, too!

16:15.391 --> 16:17.726
Shh! You'll wake up Flanders.

16:19.437 --> 16:20.812
What the...

16:23.191 --> 16:25.192
Hey, Marge, surf's up!

16:25.693 --> 16:28.278
You're using my table saw
to violate a court order?

16:28.404 --> 16:30.530
Well, we tried all those other tools.

16:33.409 --> 16:35.327
Gee, I always like to help you, Homer,

16:35.411 --> 16:38.872
but I don't want to be an accessory
to some sort of shady doings.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.248
And it does raise a whole host

16:40.333 --> 16:42.084
of ethical questions, such as...

16:42.168 --> 16:43.418
Woo-hoo!

16:50.093 --> 16:53.261
Now, time for "Operation
Judge-Get-Back-At. "

16:53.346 --> 16:55.180
If that costume shop knew we were using

16:55.264 --> 16:57.224
these burglar outfits for real,

16:57.308 --> 16:58.892
they'd be furious.

16:58.976 --> 17:02.145
Okay. She lives at 1 Ocean View Drive.

17:02.647 --> 17:04.439
Let's start skulking.

17:13.491 --> 17:15.659
Oh. It's only the milkman.

17:15.742 --> 17:19.829
Hey, maybe I should be a milkman!

17:19.914 --> 17:21.455
Concentrate, Homer.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.296
This address must be wrong.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.340
No! No, there it is!

17:32.218 --> 17:36.638
She lives in a houseboat?
Wow! She is so cool!

17:37.140 --> 17:38.890
We hate her, Homer.

17:38.975 --> 17:40.642
I know. I know. Fight the power.

17:40.727 --> 17:42.477
Let's do this thing.

17:47.024 --> 17:48.150
Cops!

17:52.655 --> 17:54.239
Ain't that sweet, Chief?

17:54.323 --> 17:55.741
It sure is, Lou.

17:55.825 --> 17:58.201
Those two longshoremen found love.

18:00.830 --> 18:02.080
Let's go.

18:12.341 --> 18:15.093
Look at her in there, washing her body.

18:15.178 --> 18:18.638
Get away from that window
and help me with this banner.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.603
I hate to call a judge dirty names,

18:24.687 --> 18:28.482
but there's only one way to describe
a nasty super witch like her.

18:29.358 --> 18:31.193
Let's get out of here!

18:36.199 --> 18:38.408
It's just a friendly seal.

18:40.411 --> 18:41.453
Shh.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.371
No, we can't play now.

18:45.875 --> 18:47.417
Shut up!

18:50.338 --> 18:52.422
What is it, Pancho?
Is someone out there?

18:58.221 --> 18:59.721
You can't hide from me.

18:59.806 --> 19:01.723
She's gonna find us!

19:01.808 --> 19:04.100
Oh, Lord, guide this cinder block.

19:04.185 --> 19:05.352
Homer, no!

19:07.605 --> 19:08.647
Oh-oh.

19:08.731 --> 19:09.981
My house!

19:16.572 --> 19:18.365
Hey, how you doing?

19:25.498 --> 19:28.750
That quilt was made by my grandmother!

19:29.335 --> 19:32.712
So... It cost you nothing.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.840
Shut up!

19:34.924 --> 19:38.927
You two are not only horrible
parents, you're violent criminals,

19:39.095 --> 19:42.305
and I'm gonna lock you up
till frogs do fractions.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.310
Your Honor, may I say something?

19:47.395 --> 19:50.021
Well, it is highly unorthodox.

19:50.523 --> 19:51.565
So, no!

19:51.649 --> 19:52.691
Please, Your Honor?

19:53.109 --> 19:55.068
Oh, I can't resist that look.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.821
You remind me of me
when I was a little boy.

19:59.031 --> 20:01.908
Your Honor, it's not
easy being my parents.

20:02.368 --> 20:04.286
I'm always screwing up in school

20:04.370 --> 20:06.413
and getting in trouble with the law.

20:06.706 --> 20:09.583
But if I grow up to be
a halfway-decent person,

20:09.667 --> 20:12.460
I know it'll be because
of my mom and dad.

20:13.379 --> 20:17.173
Everyone else might give up on
me, but my parents never will.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.218
That's my brother.

20:20.303 --> 20:23.471
Um... Did she say she used to be a dude?

20:23.723 --> 20:25.515
So, Your Honor, if
you're going to punish

20:25.600 --> 20:27.684
anyone in this courtroom today,

20:27.768 --> 20:30.312
I ask that you punish me.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.023
Okay, I will!

20:33.357 --> 20:37.652
Bartholomew Simpson, I hereby sentence
you to five years in juvenile hall!

20:39.655 --> 20:41.031
Well, I'm back from vacation.

20:41.115 --> 20:44.367
But I was just about to bang my
gavel, making the sentence official.

20:44.452 --> 20:47.078
Sorry, I've already put my clown down.

20:47.997 --> 20:49.205
But I was just going to...

20:49.290 --> 20:51.166
The clown is down.

20:53.711 --> 20:57.964
Judge Snyder, motion to declare
a writ of boys will be boys.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.425
Motion granted. Case dismissed!

21:00.509 --> 21:02.177
Woo-hoo!
Woo-hoo!

21:04.847 --> 21:07.182
All right, we got lucky that time,

21:07.266 --> 21:10.518
but I want everyone in this
family to raise your hand

21:10.603 --> 21:14.356
and promise not to break
the law for one full year.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.608
We promise. We promise.

21:19.487 --> 21:21.780
That was close.

21:21.864 --> 21:24.366
Please drive off me.

21:25.910 --> 21:27.243
What's that noise?

21:27.328 --> 21:29.913
Uh... Just the radio, dear.

21:30.164 --> 21:34.584
Dang me, dang me They ought
to take a rope and hang me

21:34.961 --> 21:37.629
High from the highest tree

21:38.214 --> 21:41.007
Woman, would you weep for me

21:59.902 --> 22:04.197
All our times have come

22:06.742 --> 22:11.079
Here but now they're gone

22:13.499 --> 22:16.167
Seasons don't fear the reaper

22:16.252 --> 22:19.004
Nor do the wind, the sun or the rain

22:19.088 --> 22:21.131
We can be like they are

22:21.215 --> 22:22.424
Come on, baby

22:22.508 --> 22:24.092
Don't fear the reaper

22:24.176 --> 22:25.760
Baby, take my hand

22:25.845 --> 22:27.387
Don't fear the reaper

22:27.888 --> 22:28.930
Cobras!
