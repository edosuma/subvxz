WEBVTT

00:01.402 --> 00:04.135
PREVIOUSLY ON "REVENGE"...

00:04.135 --> 00:05.476
TYLER WAS SHOT THREE TIMES.

00:05.476 --> 00:08.509
WE CAN FLOAT THE THEORY THERE
WAS A THIRD PERSON ON THE BEACH.

00:08.509 --> 00:11.042
CHARLOTTE TOLD THE COPS THAT
SHE SAW SOME GUY IN A HOODIE.

00:11.042 --> 00:12.443
WERE YOU HIGH LAST NIGHT?

00:12.443 --> 00:14.185
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
ON MY SIDE.

00:14.185 --> 00:15.316
I DON'T CARE WHO
YOU'RE PROTECTING OR WHY,

00:15.316 --> 00:17.618
BUT AS OF NOW, I'M GONNA
START PROTECTING YOU.

00:17.618 --> 00:19.190
(Nolan) WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
WITH THE TAPES?

00:19.190 --> 00:20.651
ONE OF THEM IS
GONNA BE FOUND ON AMANDA.

00:20.651 --> 00:22.293
TO FRAME HER...

00:22.293 --> 00:24.095
NO!
 FOR TORCHING CASA TREADWELL?

00:24.095 --> 00:25.226
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

00:25.226 --> 00:26.657
(grunts)

00:26.657 --> 00:28.729
(Victoria) MASON THINKS HIS
TAPES WERE DESTROYED IN A FIRE.

00:28.729 --> 00:30.101
YOU KNOW WHAT THIS IS?

00:30.101 --> 00:31.502
A WIRE RECEIPT
FOR $5 MILLION.

00:31.502 --> 00:32.803
IT WAS IN AMANDA'S JACKET.

00:32.803 --> 00:34.405
LET AMANDA GO.
 I CAN'T DO THAT.

00:34.405 --> 00:36.036
(judge) I ORDER DANIEL GRAYSON

00:36.036 --> 00:37.708
TO THE MAXIMUM SECURITY

00:37.708 --> 00:40.741
CORRECTIONAL FACILITY
ON RIKERS ISLAND.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.113
(buzzer sounds)

00:42.113 --> 00:45.176
(people speaking indistinctly)

00:48.519 --> 00:50.681
(Emily) DOUBT IS A DISEASE.

00:50.681 --> 00:52.523
IT INFECTS THE MIND,

00:52.523 --> 00:54.525
CREATING A MISTRUST
OF PEOPLE'S MOTIVES

00:54.525 --> 00:57.658
AND OF ONE'S OWN PERCEPTIONS.

00:57.658 --> 01:00.731
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

01:15.406 --> 01:18.349
DOUBT HAS THE ABILITY
TO CALL INTO QUESTION

01:18.349 --> 01:21.852
EVERYTHING YOU'VE EVER
BELIEVED ABOUT SOMEONE...

01:26.817 --> 01:29.260
AND REINFORCE
THE DARKEST SUSPICIONS

01:29.260 --> 01:31.662
OF OUR INNER CIRCLES.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.126
(Daniel's voice) "EMILY,
I NEED YOU TO KNOW

01:35.126 --> 01:38.129
"THAT I'M NOT GUILTY
OF WHAT THEY'RE ACCUSING ME.

01:38.129 --> 01:40.631
"SOMETHING HAPPENED
ON THE BEACH THAT NIGHT

01:40.631 --> 01:44.205
"THAT I DON'T YET
FULLY UNDERSTAND.

01:44.205 --> 01:45.606
"I ONLY HOPE YOU'LL STILL BE
BY MY SIDE

01:45.606 --> 01:48.509
WHEN THE TRUTH
FINALLY COMES TO LIGHT."

01:51.382 --> 01:52.713
(knock on door)

01:56.247 --> 01:57.688
(sighs)
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

01:57.688 --> 01:59.220
WELL, WORLD PEACE,

01:59.220 --> 02:01.422
BUT I'LL START SMALL.

02:01.422 --> 02:04.295
CROISSAN'WICH?

02:04.295 --> 02:05.726
LOOK, WHEN WAS
THE LAST TIME YOU ATE

02:05.726 --> 02:07.728
OR SLEPT
FOR THAT MATTER?

02:07.728 --> 02:09.300
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO SLEEP.

02:09.300 --> 02:10.631
DANIEL'S ABOUT TO STAND TRIAL
FOR MURDER

02:10.631 --> 02:14.565
AND VICTORIA'S CIRCLING
AMANDA AS A PATSY.

02:14.565 --> 02:17.668
WELL, YOU GOTTA GIVE HER
POINTS FOR CONSISTENCY.

02:17.668 --> 02:19.410
AND IF AMANDA RESURFACES,

02:19.410 --> 02:21.412
THE SECOND THEY PICK HER UP,
SHE GETS ARRESTED,

02:21.412 --> 02:22.913
IT'LL ALL COME OUT.

02:22.913 --> 02:24.375
IT'S GONNA BE OVER FOR YOU.

02:24.375 --> 02:26.146
TAKEDA HAS HER.
SHE'S SECURE.

02:26.146 --> 02:27.478
FOR NOW,

02:27.478 --> 02:29.149
BUT IF HE FINDS OUT
YOU'RE GOING AGAINST HIM

02:29.149 --> 02:31.782
BY TRYING TO GET DANIEL SPRUNG,
WELL...

02:31.782 --> 02:33.324
TAKEDA JUST MIGHT
RELEASE THE KRAKEN.

02:33.324 --> 02:35.386
THEN I'LL DEAL WITH IT.

02:35.386 --> 02:37.258
(chuckles) WOW.

02:37.258 --> 02:38.789
DEJA VU.

02:38.789 --> 02:43.334
I WONDER WHAT KIND OF BOX
HE'LL MAKE YOU IN WOODSHOP.

02:43.334 --> 02:45.596
TAKEDA WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

02:46.737 --> 02:48.269
I LOST FOCUS.

02:48.269 --> 02:51.342
I BECAME EMOTIONALLY INVOLVED.

02:51.342 --> 02:52.673
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.844
(cell phone beeps)

02:53.844 --> 02:55.206
(chuckles)

02:55.206 --> 02:56.247
(beep)

02:58.178 --> 03:00.211
(sighs)

03:06.287 --> 03:08.188
ENJOY.

03:13.494 --> 03:16.267
THAT'S THE GUY.
YOU NAILED IT.

03:16.267 --> 03:17.598
YOUR BROTHER
COULD GO TO PRISON

03:17.598 --> 03:19.330
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE
FOR THIS.

03:19.330 --> 03:20.601
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?
 (doorbell rings)

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
YEAH, MOM.
THAT'S TOTALLY WHAT I WANT.

03:22.303 --> 03:23.674
THEN HELP US HELP HIM.

03:23.674 --> 03:25.376
HOW MANY TIMES
CAN I SAY THIS?

03:25.376 --> 03:28.279
IT WAS DARK. I COULDN'T SEE
THE GUY'S FACE.

03:28.279 --> 03:31.312
SO YOU'RE NOT CERTAIN
IT WAS A GUY, HMM?
 (door opens)

03:31.312 --> 03:32.283
COULD IT HAVE BEEN A WOMAN...
 (door closes)

03:32.283 --> 03:33.444
WHOSE HAIR WAS TUCKED UP
INTO THE HOOD?

03:33.444 --> 03:35.846
SOMEONE LIKE MY HALF SISTER?

03:35.846 --> 03:37.388
I HAVE NO IDEA.

03:37.388 --> 03:39.390
AMANDA AND I WEREN'T
EXACTLY CLOSE GROWING UP.

03:39.390 --> 03:41.922
HEY, CHARLOTTE.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.394
MRS. GRAYSON, HI.

03:43.394 --> 03:44.725
HI, DECLAN.

03:44.725 --> 03:46.357
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

03:46.357 --> 03:47.858
IT'S ORIENTATION DAY,
RIGHT?

03:47.858 --> 03:50.301
I MEAN... I-IF YOU'RE STILL
COOL WITH ME

03:50.301 --> 03:51.932
GOING TO COLLINS WITH YOU.

03:51.932 --> 03:53.304
OF COURSE I AM.

03:53.304 --> 03:54.635
DECLAN,

03:54.635 --> 03:56.337
I NEED YOU TO THINK
REALLY HARD

03:56.337 --> 03:58.309
ABOUT THE HOODED PERSON
YOU SAW ON THE BEACH.

03:58.309 --> 04:00.341
CHARLOTTE'S STARTING TO THINK
THAT IT WAS A WOMAN

04:00.341 --> 04:02.242
YOU BOTH SAW IN THE BLACKNESS.

04:04.014 --> 04:06.817
IT'S LIKE YOU SAID,
IT WAS BLACKNESS.

04:06.817 --> 04:09.950
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST,
I DON'T THINK I'D BE MUCH HELP.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.452
ENOUGH, MOM.
WE'VE GOT ORIENTATION.

04:11.452 --> 04:14.355
DECLAN NEEDS TO MAKE
A GOOD FIRST IMPRESSION.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.430
A WORD?

04:19.430 --> 04:21.362
YES, MA'AM.

04:21.362 --> 04:24.365
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE, HUH?

04:24.365 --> 04:25.496
MY THOUGHTS
EXACTLY,

04:25.496 --> 04:27.598
EXCEPT I'M REALLY
NOT FEELING ORIENTATION.

04:27.598 --> 04:30.701
IT SEEMS LIKE
MORE OF A BEACH DAY.

04:30.701 --> 04:31.872
(people speaking indistinctly)

04:31.872 --> 04:33.043
ANY LUCK WITH THE SKETCH?

04:33.043 --> 04:34.605
WE'RE STILL
WORKING ON IT.

04:34.605 --> 04:37.448
ANY LEADS ON AMANDA CLARKE'S
WHEREABOUTS YET?

04:37.448 --> 04:39.950
MY INVESTIGATORS ARE
FORMER FBI, CIA, RESPECTIVELY.

04:39.950 --> 04:41.452
THEY'LL FIND HER.

04:41.452 --> 04:44.014
BUT FOR NOW, SHE APPEARS TO
HAVE VANISHED WITHOUT A TRACE.

04:44.014 --> 04:46.387
WELL, THAT MUST HAVE
TAKEN SOME DOING ON HER PART.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.759
WHICH IS WHY I'D LIKE
TO EXPLORE OTHER AVENUES

04:48.759 --> 04:49.920
OF REASONABLE DOUBT.

04:49.920 --> 04:51.061
I WON'T BE SATISFIED

04:51.061 --> 04:52.563
UNTIL YOU EXHAUST
EVERY EFFORT

04:52.563 --> 04:54.064
TO FIND OUT WHERE SHE'S BEEN

04:54.064 --> 04:56.697
AND WHAT SHE'S BEEN DOING
FOR THE PAST 18 YEARS.

04:56.697 --> 04:58.599
THAT GIRL IS INVOLVED,
AND I AM DEAD CERTAIN OF IT.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.300
VICTORIA, WE CAN'T PUT
ALL OUR EGGS

05:00.300 --> 05:01.972
INTO ONE PARTICULAR BASKET.

05:01.972 --> 05:04.304
IF WE CAN'T PROVE THAT AMANDA
WAS ON THE BEACH THAT NIGHT,

05:04.304 --> 05:07.307
THE PROSECUTION WINS,
AND DANIEL STAYS IN PRISON.

05:07.307 --> 05:08.439
WHICH IS WHY WE'LL NEED
TO PRESENT THE JURY

05:08.439 --> 05:10.411
WITH AT LEAST ONE OTHER
VIABLE SUSPECT.

05:10.411 --> 05:12.312
WELL, WHAT ABOUT JACK PORTER?

05:12.312 --> 05:14.445
HE WAS DATING AMANDA,

05:14.445 --> 05:16.847
AND SHE HAD HIM CONVINCED
THAT OUR FAMILY

05:16.847 --> 05:18.018
WAS SOMEHOW INVOLVED

05:18.018 --> 05:19.420
IN THE TERRIBLE THINGS
THAT HER FATHER DID.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.091
YOU THINK THEY'RE ALIGNED
IN SOME SORT OF VENDETTA?

05:21.091 --> 05:22.853
WHAT WE THINK IS NOT
THE RELEVANT POINT.

05:22.853 --> 05:24.425
IT'S WHAT THE JURY THINKS.

05:24.425 --> 05:29.430
MAYBE CHARLOTTE DID SEE
A MAN ON THE BEACH AFTER ALL.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.601
(door closes)

05:30.601 --> 05:32.533
OKAY, SO WHAT'S UP
WITH THIS URGENT TEXT?

05:32.533 --> 05:34.505
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT
THAT WIRE RECEIPT.

05:34.505 --> 05:37.067
LOOK, THE GRAYSONS
BOUGHT OFF YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

05:37.067 --> 05:38.539
WHAT ELSE IS THERE
TO THINK ABOUT?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.710
I CALLED THE BANK.

05:39.710 --> 05:40.871
THEY WOULDN'T TELL ME

05:40.871 --> 05:42.042
IF THE ACCOUNT
WAS EVEN IN AMANDA'S NAME.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.774
OBVIOUSLY.
WHO ELSE'S WOULD IT BE?

05:43.774 --> 05:45.816
THAT'S WHAT I WANT YOU
TO FIND OUT.

05:45.816 --> 05:48.379
DO YOUR HACKING THING.
GET INTO THE BANK RECORDS.

05:48.379 --> 05:50.521
OKAY, JACK... HEY.

05:50.521 --> 05:52.483
THIS IS NOT YOU.

05:52.483 --> 05:54.525
YOU NEED TO JUST
PUT THIS BEHIND YOU.

05:54.525 --> 05:56.557
HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO DO THAT?

05:56.557 --> 05:58.529
OKAY, HEY,
I'M ON YOUR SIDE, MAN.

05:58.529 --> 06:00.391
OKAY, THEN TELL ME
WHAT SIDE I'M ON,

06:00.391 --> 06:01.692
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
ANYMORE.

06:01.692 --> 06:03.394
I THOUGHT AMANDA HAD SOMETHING
TO DO WITH TYLER'S MURDER,

06:03.394 --> 06:04.695
BUT NOW
ALL SIGNS POINT TO DANIEL,

06:04.695 --> 06:07.438
SO WHERE THE HELL
DID SHE GO?

06:07.438 --> 06:08.939
AND WHY HASN'T SHE
CONTACTED ME?

06:08.939 --> 06:11.141
AND WHAT'S THE DEAL WITH
ALL THIS MONEY AND THE BLOOD--

06:11.141 --> 06:12.503
THE BLOOD I FOUND
ON HER JACKET?

06:12.503 --> 06:14.545
IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE.

06:14.545 --> 06:17.648
SO I'M SORRY, NOLAN,
IF I CAN'T JUST...

06:17.648 --> 06:20.050
PUT IT ALL BEHIND ME.

06:23.454 --> 06:25.786
(people speaking indistinctly,
footsteps approaching)

06:25.786 --> 06:27.988
(sighs)
WHAT'S GOING ON?

06:27.988 --> 06:30.521
WE'RE WAITING
FOR A TRIAL DATE.

06:30.521 --> 06:31.662
CONRAD, VICTORIA.

06:31.662 --> 06:33.424
I'LL TALK TO YOU THEN.
 (cell phone beeps)

06:33.424 --> 06:35.596
THE PEOPLE vs. DANIEL GRAYSON

06:35.596 --> 06:37.928
WILL COMMENCE
THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER.

06:37.928 --> 06:40.000
WELL, IT'S AS SPEEDY A TRIAL
AS WE COULD'VE HOPED FOR,

06:40.000 --> 06:41.532
I IMAGINE.

06:41.532 --> 06:42.903
(people continue
speaking indistinctly)

06:42.903 --> 06:44.435
WHAT ABOUT REVISITING BAIL?

06:44.435 --> 06:46.937
UNFORTUNATELY, WE'RE DEALING
WITH A HARD-LINE JUDGE.

06:46.937 --> 06:49.480
BARRING
A LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION,

06:49.480 --> 06:51.742
RIKERS WILL BE DANIEL'S HOME

06:51.742 --> 06:53.544
FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

06:53.544 --> 06:55.686
I THINK THE BEST THING THAT WE
CAN DO FOR DANIEL RIGHT NOW

06:55.686 --> 06:57.588
IS TO TRACK DOWN
AMANDA CLARKE.

06:57.588 --> 06:58.749
(cell phone beeps)
 EXCUSE ME.

06:58.749 --> 07:00.491
AS OF THIS MORNING,
AMANDA CLARKE IS NO LONGER

07:00.491 --> 07:01.652
OUR SOLE FOCUS.

07:01.652 --> 07:03.554
(notebook and pen clatter)

07:03.554 --> 07:04.525
THE SKETCH ARTIST
HAS COME UP WITH

07:04.525 --> 07:06.627
AN EQUALLY COMPELLING SUSPECT.

07:08.699 --> 07:11.862
THIS LOOKS LIKE
JACK PORTER.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.447
♪♪♪

07:35.486 --> 07:36.657
YOU'RE FRIENDLY
WITH JACK PORTER.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.858
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HIM,
EXACTLY?

07:37.858 --> 07:39.189
WELL, HOW WELL I KNOW HIM
IS GONNA BE FAR LESS IMPORTANT

07:39.189 --> 07:41.832
THAN HOW HE'S KNOWN
AROUND TOWN.

07:41.832 --> 07:43.163
DO WE REALLY WANT TO SUGGEST

07:43.163 --> 07:44.695
TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GONNA
MAKE UP THE JURY POOL

07:44.695 --> 07:47.197
THAT MONTAUK'S FAVORITE SON
COULD BE THE KILLER?

07:47.197 --> 07:48.769
WELL, UNLESS
AMANDA CLARKE SURFACES,

07:48.769 --> 07:51.471
WE MAY NEVER KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT.

07:51.471 --> 07:55.646
AND THE DEFENSE COULD PAINT JACK
AS A TYPICALLY SENSIBLE MAN

07:55.646 --> 07:57.848
DRIVEN TO ILLOGIC
BY A CONNIVING TEMPTRESS.

07:57.848 --> 07:59.179
WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME.

08:01.151 --> 08:03.714
I THINK EMILY'S GOT A POINT,
THOUGH.

08:03.714 --> 08:06.086
THESE DAYS, A BARTENDER MAKES
A FAR LESS COMPELLING TARGET

08:06.086 --> 08:07.688
THAN A MEMBER OF THE 1%.

08:07.688 --> 08:11.091
WHAT WE NEED IS A SPIN DOCTOR
ON OUR SIDE, A GOOD ONE.

08:11.091 --> 08:13.564
MM. SOMEBODY WHO CAN HELP
SHAPE THE PUBLIC OPINION

08:13.564 --> 08:15.526
BEFORE ARGUMENTS EVEN START.

08:15.526 --> 08:16.697
MM-HMM.

08:16.697 --> 08:18.498
WHAT ABOUT MASON TREADWELL?

08:18.498 --> 08:19.670
WELL, HE HASN'T RETURNED
ANY OF MY CALLS

08:19.670 --> 08:20.631
SINCE THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE.

08:20.631 --> 08:23.103
HE SEEMS TO HAVE VANISHED
AS WELL.

08:23.103 --> 08:24.635
I'M SURE
ANOTHER TRIAL OF THE DECADE

08:24.635 --> 08:26.707
COULD HELP LURE HIM
OUT OF HIDING.

08:26.707 --> 08:28.639
I'M GONNA LOOK INTO IT.

08:28.639 --> 08:29.810
EXCUSE ME.

08:29.810 --> 08:31.982
YEAH.

08:31.982 --> 08:35.645
THAT GIRL JUST MIGHT BE
GRAYSON MATERIAL AFTER ALL.

08:37.116 --> 08:39.820
(cell phone rings)

08:39.820 --> 08:41.552
(ring)
 (man) MRS. GRAYSON.

08:41.552 --> 08:43.023
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

08:43.023 --> 08:46.126
I NEED TO GET A MESSAGE
TO AN INMATE AT RIKERS.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.829
Is that something
you know how to do?

08:48.829 --> 08:51.832
YEAH.
TRY THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE.

08:51.832 --> 08:54.735
IT'S NOT THAT KIND
OF MESSAGE.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.307
(Nolan) SO BASICALLY,
HER PLAN IS TO FRAME JACK

08:57.307 --> 08:59.770

08:59.770 --> 09:01.842
DON'T YOU FIND THAT
THE LEAST BIT IRONIC,

09:01.842 --> 09:04.214
AND HOW COULD YOU LET HER PUT
JACK AT RISK LIKE THAT?

09:04.214 --> 09:05.916
THE PROSECUTORS ALREADY
HAVE THEIR SUSPECT.

09:05.916 --> 09:07.718
THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO AFTER JACK,
AND IF THEY DO,

09:07.718 --> 09:10.951
WELL, I ALWAYS HAVE
MY ONE TRUMP CARD TO PLAY.

09:10.951 --> 09:12.723
'CAUSE...

09:12.723 --> 09:15.726
YOU'D COME CLEAN FOR JACK?

09:15.726 --> 09:16.887
ALL RIGHT.

09:16.887 --> 09:18.829
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME
TO DO?

09:18.829 --> 09:20.130
FIND MASON TREADWELL.

09:20.130 --> 09:21.662
OH, GOD.

09:21.662 --> 09:24.665
HE IS THE PERFECT PERSON
TO RUN WITH THIS STORY.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.166
HE HAS IT OUT FOR AMANDA.
WE CAN USE THAT.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.338
UGH.

09:28.338 --> 09:29.740
ALL RIGHT, FINE.

09:29.740 --> 09:31.742
YOU KNOW,
SPEAKING OF AMANDA,

09:31.742 --> 09:35.075
JACK IS LIKE
A HANGDOG WITH A BONE

09:35.075 --> 09:36.877
ABOUT THIS
WIRE TRANSFER THING.

09:36.877 --> 09:39.309
HE WANTS ME TO HACK INTO
THE BANK IN CANADA TO MAKE SURE

09:39.309 --> 09:41.311
IT'S AMANDA ON
THE RECEIVING END OF THE $5 MIL.

09:41.311 --> 09:42.953
SO THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE GONNA DO.

09:42.953 --> 09:44.114
WHAT?

09:44.114 --> 09:45.816
GET HIM OUT OF TOWN
AND AWAY FROM THE GRAYSONS.

09:45.816 --> 09:47.718
BECAUSE THAT WON'T MAKE THEM
ALL THE MORE SUSPICIOUS?

09:47.718 --> 09:49.720
AMANDA WAS HIS GIRLFRIEND.
HE WENT TO FIND HER.

09:49.720 --> 09:51.892
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE
AND IT'S THE TRUTH.

09:51.892 --> 09:53.023
FOR ONCE.

09:53.023 --> 09:55.065
BUT, UH...

09:55.065 --> 09:56.827
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
HE'LL GO?

09:56.827 --> 10:00.030
BECAUSE HE LOVES HER.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.104
(buzzer sounds)

10:04.104 --> 10:06.136
(door clatters)

10:07.908 --> 10:10.911
(indistinct conversations)

10:14.745 --> 10:16.987
God, I miss you.

10:16.987 --> 10:19.119
Are you okay?
You look tired.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.221
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

10:21.221 --> 10:23.854
It's just like camp,

10:23.854 --> 10:25.756
only instead of people

10:25.756 --> 10:27.297
telling ghost stories
around a fire,

10:27.297 --> 10:28.829
they just kind of

10:28.829 --> 10:31.201
SCREAM ALL NIGHT
FROM THEIR CELLS.

10:31.201 --> 10:32.903
(sighs)

10:32.903 --> 10:35.305
I'll get you some earplugs.
 DON'T BOTHER.

10:35.305 --> 10:37.808
Someone might think
I'm getting special treatment.

10:37.808 --> 10:39.639
I don't want to draw
any more attention to myself

10:39.639 --> 10:41.712
than I'm already getting.

10:41.712 --> 10:43.774
There are ways
to stay safe, you know?

10:43.774 --> 10:46.046
KEEP YOUR HEAD UP,
DON'T LOOK DOWN,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.748
but don't stare either.

10:47.748 --> 10:50.751
And don't gamble. You don't
want to owe anybody anything.

10:50.751 --> 10:53.754
You can take the girl
out of juvie... (chuckles)

10:53.754 --> 10:55.956

10:55.956 --> 11:00.130

11:00.130 --> 11:02.432
Thank you for your letter.

11:02.432 --> 11:03.934
BUT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY.

11:03.934 --> 11:06.336
I'M ALWAYS GONNA BE HERE
BY YOUR SIDE

11:06.336 --> 11:09.169
and so is your family.

11:09.169 --> 11:13.844
Well, at least one good thing
has come out of this.

11:13.844 --> 11:16.977
My fiancée and mother have
finally found common ground.

11:16.977 --> 11:19.109
(indistinct conversations

11:20.410 --> 11:23.253
(Nolan) SO, MASON,

11:23.253 --> 11:26.156
THIS IS HOW YOU'VE BEEN
SPENDING YOUR DAYS?

11:26.156 --> 11:28.088
MOST OF THEM.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.920
WINE COOLERS?

11:29.920 --> 11:32.893
OH, I'VE NEVER BEEN
MUCH OF A DRUNKARD.

11:32.893 --> 11:35.025
FITZGERALD, FAULKNER,
HEMINGWAY, OF COURSE--

11:35.025 --> 11:36.827
THESE WERE PILLARS
OF CIRRHOSIS.

11:36.827 --> 11:38.328
ME? I'VE ALWAYS BEEN
A LIGHTWEIGHT.

11:38.328 --> 11:40.330
SO DOES THIS MEAN

11:40.330 --> 11:44.875
YOU'VE DECIDED AGAINST
WRITING MY BIOGRAPHY?

11:44.875 --> 11:48.278
THAT DECISION
WAS MADE FOR ME.

11:48.278 --> 11:50.180
MY TYPEWRITER IS NOW
BUT A...

11:50.180 --> 11:53.944
AN UNSIGHTLY HEAP
OF MOLTEN DREAMS.

11:53.944 --> 11:55.886
I'LL NEVER WRITE AGAIN.

11:55.886 --> 11:58.088
POETIC JUSTICE
HAS BEEN SERVED.

11:58.088 --> 12:00.090
I CAN'T HELP FEELING
LIKE I BEAR

12:00.090 --> 12:03.854
SOME RESPONSIBILITY
FOR WHAT HAPPENED.

12:03.854 --> 12:05.355
WELL, IF WE HADN'T BEEN
OUT TO DINNER

12:05.355 --> 12:07.157
THE NIGHT THE FIRE STARTED--

12:07.157 --> 12:09.359
UNBURDEN YOURSELF,
NOLAN.

12:09.359 --> 12:11.862
THIS WAS THE WORK
OF A SINGULAR FORCE,

12:11.862 --> 12:14.364
ONE WHICH BEARS THE NAME
AMANDA CLARKE.

12:14.364 --> 12:16.206
(chuckles)

12:16.206 --> 12:18.038
WELL, IF DANIEL HADN'T BEEN
ARRESTED THE OTHER NIGHT,

12:18.038 --> 12:20.941
I'D SAY,
YOU SOUNDED PARANOID.

12:20.941 --> 12:23.013
WHAT DID HE DO THIS TIME?

12:23.013 --> 12:24.214
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW?

12:25.946 --> 12:29.149
WELL... THE NIGHT
OF HIS ENGAGEMENT PARTY,

12:29.149 --> 12:32.222
A MAN WAS FOUND SHOT TO DEATH
ON THE BEACH.

12:32.222 --> 12:34.885
THE GRAYSONS
ARE WORKING OFF A THEORY

12:34.885 --> 12:40.791
THAT SOMEHOW AMANDA
SET UP DANIEL TO TAKE THE FALL.

12:40.791 --> 12:42.993
I BET THEY ARE.

12:42.993 --> 12:45.165
YOU KNOW...

12:46.436 --> 12:49.299
THAT COULD MAKE FOR
A... THRILLING CONCLUSION

12:49.299 --> 12:51.771
TO YOUR DAVID CLARKE SAGA.

12:57.978 --> 13:00.050
SO IT'S YOUR BELIEF
THAT AMANDA

13:00.050 --> 13:02.082
AND HER CHILDHOOD PARAMOUR
WORKED TOGETHER

13:02.082 --> 13:04.084
TO MURDER TYLER
AND FRAME DANIEL?

13:04.084 --> 13:05.916
CORRECT.

13:05.916 --> 13:07.387
WELL, AS MUCH AS I'D LIKE
TO NAIL AMANDA CLARKE,

13:07.387 --> 13:09.059
IT SOUNDS LIKE A REACH.

13:09.059 --> 13:11.791
WELL, HAVE YOU SEEN
THE SKETCH?

13:11.791 --> 13:13.163
THE SKETCH
DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

13:13.163 --> 13:15.025
IT DOES IF YOU SAY IT DOES.

13:15.025 --> 13:17.067
PEOPLE HANG ON YOUR EVERY WORD.

13:17.067 --> 13:19.099
(Emily) LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
TELLING YOU WHAT TO REPORT.

13:19.099 --> 13:21.801
WE'RE JUST ASKING THAT YOU DO
WHAT YOU DO BEST.

13:21.801 --> 13:23.103
(chuckles)

13:23.103 --> 13:24.504
I'LL GIVE YOU EXCLUSIVE ACCESS,

13:24.504 --> 13:28.038
AND WE CAN SET UP A WORKSPACE
IN CONRAD'S OLD DEN.

13:28.038 --> 13:30.941
IT WOULD MAKE A RATHER BRILLIANT
MULTI-ISSUE SERIES.

13:30.941 --> 13:33.383
"HARPER'S," PERHAPS
OR "VANITY FAIR."

13:33.383 --> 13:35.085
I COULD SEE
GRAYDON CARTER BITING.

13:35.085 --> 13:36.546
ACTUALLY, DANIEL'S TRIAL
IS IN THREE MONTHS,

13:36.546 --> 13:38.048
AND THINGS ARE CHANGING
SO QUICKLY,

13:38.048 --> 13:40.450
THIS KIND OF SITUATION
CALLS FOR

13:40.450 --> 13:42.923
REAL-TIME, ONLINE BLOGGING.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.595

THE SLIGHTEST THING ABOUT BLOGS.

13:45.595 --> 13:46.957
YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

13:46.957 --> 13:48.528

THE DOMAIN NAME

13:48.528 --> 13:51.001
"THE TREADWELL REPORT,"

13:51.001 --> 13:54.064
AND I'M PREPARED TO FINALIZE
THE WEB SITE DESIGN

13:54.064 --> 13:55.465
AS SOON
AS THIS MEETING'S DONE.

13:57.237 --> 13:58.869

IS WRITE.

13:58.869 --> 14:02.472
I'LL HAVE A ROOM MADE UP

HOW IS HE?

15:11.681 --> 15:13.213
(people speaking indistinctly)

15:13.213 --> 15:15.986
HE SUSTAINED A CONCUSSION,
TWO CRACKED RIBS,

15:15.986 --> 15:18.448
AND A SMALL FRACTURE
TO HIS LEFT ORBITAL BONE.

15:18.448 --> 15:20.490
(gasps) MY GOD.

15:20.490 --> 15:24.424
YOU SAID THAT IF HE FACED
A LIFE-THREATENING CONDITION

15:24.424 --> 15:26.296
THAT THE JUDGE
WOULD RECONSIDER BAIL.

15:26.296 --> 15:28.999
CLEARLY, THE CONDITIONS
IN THIS GODFORSAKEN PLACE

15:28.999 --> 15:30.330
ARE EXACTLY THAT.

15:30.330 --> 15:31.701
HE COULD'VE BEEN KILLED HERE.

15:31.701 --> 15:33.403
I'VE ALREADY SPOKEN
TO THE JUDGE.

15:33.403 --> 15:36.306
IN LIGHT OF THE ATTACK
AND DANIEL'S GROWING CELEBRITY,

15:36.306 --> 15:39.169
SHE'S AGREED TO REVISIT
MY ARGUMENT ON HOUSE ARREST.

15:39.169 --> 15:41.311
WITH ANY LUCK,
HE SHOULD BE BACK HOME

15:41.311 --> 15:43.073
AS SOON AS TOMORROW.

15:43.073 --> 15:44.344
THE SOONER, THE BETTER.

THE FACT
THAT EITHER OF OUR CHILDREN

40:36.505 --> 40:38.006
FIND THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY

40:38.006 --> 40:40.739
RESTS SQUARELY
ON YOUR SHOULDERS,

40:40.739 --> 40:42.571
NOT MINE.

40:44.172 --> 40:49.017
IN SOCIETY, WOMEN ARE REFERRED
TO AS "THE FAIRER SEX"...

40:52.180 --> 40:55.824
(motor whirring)

40:57.926 --> 40:59.187
(elevator clanks)

41:16.775 --> 41:18.977
BUT IN THE WILD,
THE FEMALE SPECIES

41:18.977 --> 41:23.512
CAN BE FAR MORE FEROCIOUS
THAN THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS.

41:23.512 --> 41:24.853
AFTER YOU.

41:24.853 --> 41:26.915
ACTUALLY...

41:26.915 --> 41:28.817
BEFORE WE GO...

41:28.817 --> 41:31.259
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANT TO GIVE YOU.

41:31.259 --> 41:33.261
OH, YEAH?

41:33.261 --> 41:34.893
RIGHT HERE IN THE ALLEY?

41:34.893 --> 41:36.965
MM-HMM.

41:38.967 --> 41:40.869
(whispers)
THIS IS FOR JACK.

41:40.869 --> 41:42.270
WHO?

41:42.270 --> 41:46.004
(both grunting)

41:52.911 --> 41:56.114
(both continue grunting)

41:59.517 --> 42:00.689
(panting)

42:00.689 --> 42:02.020
DEFENDING THE NEST

42:02.020 --> 42:05.924
IS BOTH OUR OLDEST
AND STRONGEST INSTINCT.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.996
(continues panting)
AND THAT WAS FOR DANIEL.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.207
AND SOMETIMES

42:19.207 --> 42:21.870
IT CAN ALSO BE
THE MOST GRATIFYING.
