Excuse me?

02:46.033 --> 02:47.835
ANNOUNCER (V.O.): What's up,
Savannah?

02:47.868 --> 02:50.271
It's Captain Mack with your
8:00 o'clock six pack.

02:50.304 --> 02:53.807
Put it in the Christmas spirit
with some Christmas jams.
What's up? What's up?

02:56.610 --> 02:57.645
Ian?

02:57.678 --> 02:58.646
(DOOR CLOSES)

02:58.679 --> 02:59.647
Oy!

02:59.680 --> 03:01.081
Oy!

03:01.114 --> 03:05.653
Something smells delicious!

03:05.686 --> 03:08.256
Where's my big, beautiful baby?

03:08.289 --> 03:10.591
How is my little baby?

03:10.624 --> 03:11.925
Ravenously hungry.

03:11.959 --> 03:15.763
My, god, that makes three of
us. Babe, did you get any beer?

03:15.796 --> 03:19.199
Yup, bottom shelf. And your
mail is on the table.

03:19.233 --> 03:21.034
Mm, okay.

03:21.068 --> 03:24.372
By the way, there was something
addressed to you as
Cillian Wood.

03:24.405 --> 03:28.208
Wow, I haven't been called that
since I was a kid.

03:28.242 --> 03:31.178
You know, I always thought it
sounded like a lame
70's rock band.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.781
I think it's distinguished.

03:36.817 --> 03:44.492
So... there's been a
development. Read it.

03:48.296 --> 03:50.498
They found my father's will.

03:50.531 --> 03:53.934
The old man came through and
left everything to me and Zach.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.269
All of it.

03:55.303 --> 03:57.305
Baby, that's amazing!

04:00.474 --> 04:02.109
I mean, look at us,
living like this.

04:02.142 --> 04:05.245
You know, he could have helped
at any time, but he never did.

04:05.279 --> 04:06.380
Selfish prick.

04:06.414 --> 04:08.248
But he came through now.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.383
Yes, he did.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.952
So, now what happens?

04:11.985 --> 04:17.558
Now... go through probate,
which, I don't know, hopefully
shouldn't take too long.

04:17.591 --> 04:18.759
Yeah?

04:18.791 --> 04:19.726
Mm.

04:21.795 --> 04:25.733
Hey.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.167
What's the matter?

04:27.200 --> 04:28.201
I just...

04:28.235 --> 04:30.003
I thought you'd be happy?

04:30.037 --> 04:34.274
I am happy, I just... I don't
want anything to go wrong.

04:34.308 --> 04:39.347
Baby, nothing's gonna go wrong.
Okay?

04:39.380 --> 04:45.052
You're right. She's right.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.855
We'll be in a house of our own
before the baby's born.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.129
You get these pains only
in the morning?

04:56.163 --> 05:00.067
No, I'll get them all the time.
It's like I'm being stabbed.

05:00.100 --> 05:02.770
Have you noticed any blood?

05:02.803 --> 05:05.205
No.

05:05.238 --> 05:07.475
Is everything okay, Doctor?

05:07.508 --> 05:10.544
The baby looks healthy.

05:10.578 --> 05:12.780
Good heart rate, good
position in the uterus.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.182
You and the baby seem
to be just fine.

05:15.215 --> 05:16.650
You're absolutely sure?

05:16.684 --> 05:17.918
Do you want to take a look?

05:17.951 --> 05:19.487
Yeah.

05:19.520 --> 05:23.190
No. You might peek between its
legs. Spoil the surprise.

05:23.223 --> 05:24.758
What's the matter, babe?

05:24.792 --> 05:29.062
Ian, could I speak with your
wife alone for a moment,
please?

05:31.331 --> 05:34.067
Sure. It's okay.

05:34.101 --> 05:35.068
I love you.

05:35.102 --> 05:41.208
I love you, too.

05:41.241 --> 05:43.811
Here you go.

05:43.844 --> 05:49.450
So, talk to me.

05:49.483 --> 05:52.586
I'm so scared something's
gonna go wrong again.

05:52.620 --> 05:58.592
It's normal to have these
feelings after a miscarriage
and Althea subsequent...
problems.

05:58.626 --> 06:01.328
That's a nice way
of putting it.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.997
Are you still taking
the lithium?

06:04.031 --> 06:08.035
Yes, but I want to stop. You
said there could be some risk.

06:08.068 --> 06:11.672
I have a feeling it's what's
causing the pain and could be
hurting the baby.

06:11.705 --> 06:13.741
We went through this when you
first got pregnant.

06:13.774 --> 06:16.410
The risk is very, very slight.

06:16.444 --> 06:23.551
As long as the levels of
lithium remain normal in your
blood, you and the baby
should be safe.

06:23.584 --> 06:26.086
But it is important that you
stay on the medication.

06:26.119 --> 06:30.424
But I don't need it any more.
My mind is fine, it's my
body that's in pain.

06:30.458 --> 06:32.526
I understand that you
feel that way...

06:32.560 --> 06:36.897
But coming off of it could
trigger hallucinations and
night terrors again
and I don't...

06:36.930 --> 06:40.834
I don't care about myself. It's
my baby that's important.

06:40.868 --> 06:44.371
Its health is only as
good as yours.

06:44.404 --> 06:51.879
I want you to promise me that
you're gonna keep taking
the pills, okay?

06:54.314 --> 06:56.083
Okay.

06:56.116 --> 06:57.618
Good girl.

07:18.772 --> 07:21.141
B, you okay?

07:21.174 --> 07:22.910
Yeah.

07:24.211 --> 07:25.946
Just morning sickness?

07:25.979 --> 07:28.348
No, just pain.

07:28.381 --> 07:29.917
Pain...

07:29.950 --> 07:32.553
Little boy, little girl a
little restless in there?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.354
It's a little different
than last time, huh?

07:34.387 --> 07:36.790
Yeah, it is.

07:43.497 --> 07:45.365
You still okay to have lunch
with my brother?

07:45.398 --> 07:47.735
Mm-hm. I'll be fine.

07:47.768 --> 07:51.972
And besides, I haven't seen
Zach in ages and I haven't even
met his girlfriend.

07:52.005 --> 07:52.973
Oh.

07:53.006 --> 07:54.808
What's she like?

07:54.842 --> 07:59.913
She's a little trashy, but he
likes her. I'll give a minute.

08:14.962 --> 08:19.099
Such an interesting dish.
What's it called again?

08:19.132 --> 08:20.267
Feijoada.

08:20.300 --> 08:22.135
I love it. It's delicious.

08:22.169 --> 08:25.773
It's Brazilian, very popular in
the area I come from.

08:25.806 --> 08:29.610
It's made with pork ears
and knees, sausage.

08:29.643 --> 08:33.780
Very strong food. Not too
spicy for you, I hope.

08:33.813 --> 08:38.785
Honey, spicy is what I
specialize in.

08:38.818 --> 08:43.890
Well, we never had it this good
when we were kids, did we?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.093
Well, this is nice,
it's real nice.

08:46.126 --> 08:52.299
When our old man moved us down
here, Mom didn't
really cook much.

08:52.332 --> 08:57.237
She seemed to only have time
for pedicures and
tennis lessons.

08:57.270 --> 09:00.240
So, were your parents good
together or did they
fight a lot?

09:00.273 --> 09:04.878
God, you ask the stupidest
questions. Just get me
another beer.

09:08.882 --> 09:11.518
Can we have a nice lunch,
please?

09:11.551 --> 09:13.086
Here, have some more.

09:13.120 --> 09:14.955
No more pork ears for me.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.489
What about you, Lorena? Would
you like some more?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.191
I better not.

09:18.225 --> 09:21.028
Yeah, she better not, because
she's getting a little fat.

09:21.061 --> 09:25.098
He's crazy. You've got a
terrific figure.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.433
Babe, you want some more?

09:26.466 --> 09:28.435
Yes, well, I'm eating for two.

09:28.468 --> 09:30.370
Yes, you are eating for two.

09:30.403 --> 09:33.006
So, do you guys know if you're
having a boy or a girl yet?

09:33.040 --> 09:35.976
No, we wanted to keep
it a surprise.

09:36.009 --> 09:38.612
Surprise.

09:38.646 --> 09:40.047
No, no, no, babe. You
shouldn't, you shouldn't.

09:40.080 --> 09:43.416
I'm not drinking, I just want
to propose a toast.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.953
Okay. What are we toasting to?

09:45.986 --> 09:49.156
Family, friends, the baby.
All the usual stuff.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.490
Mm-hm.

09:50.523 --> 09:53.661
And of course, to great news.
Cheers.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.462
What great news?

09:55.495 --> 09:57.765
Oh, didn't you hear? They
found the will.

09:57.798 --> 10:00.233
The money's coming through,
their dad left it all to them.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.469
Zach, you never told me that.

10:02.502 --> 10:08.075
Because it's none of your
fucking business, and it's
not official yet.

10:08.108 --> 10:09.342
It's not official.

10:13.280 --> 10:17.550
You okay? B, you okay?

10:17.584 --> 10:21.288
Yeah, I'm fine. Excuse me.

11:11.604 --> 11:13.573
She's my wife.

11:13.606 --> 11:15.608
(CLEARS THROAT) (GASPS)

11:15.642 --> 11:18.478
Zach said there's a pool. I
brought my suit. Mind if
I go for a swim?

11:18.511 --> 11:22.215
IAN (O.S.): All you do is
antagonize her. Please,
just lay off.

11:22.249 --> 11:26.019
No, I'll go with you.

11:26.053 --> 11:28.421
Hm.

11:36.363 --> 11:40.233
Sounds like Zach and Ian had a
pretty lousy childhood.

11:40.267 --> 11:43.170
Yeah, their parents split up
when they were teenagers.

11:43.203 --> 11:46.206
They never spoke to
their father again.

11:46.239 --> 11:50.811
But he left them the money
anyways? Weird.

11:50.844 --> 11:57.450
I don't know. In the end, it's
family that counts. That's
what Ian always says.

11:57.484 --> 12:01.789
Ian sure got all that charm.

12:01.822 --> 12:06.126
Zach acts all moody and angry
bear most of the time.

12:06.159 --> 12:09.897
Yeah, I just heard him fighting
with Ian upstairs.

12:09.930 --> 12:15.035
He was furious that Ian told me
about the will, but why
shouldn't I know they found it?

12:15.068 --> 12:18.271
It doesn't make sense.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.974
Beats me.

12:21.008 --> 12:25.378
Zach hates it when people ask
him anything about his family.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.982
But I'm family, Lorena.

12:42.629 --> 12:45.765
Babe, we gotta call the
plumber. The water's
coming out all foggy.

12:45.799 --> 12:48.368
I know, babe. I keep meaning
to call the plumber.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.570
Call the plumber, call the
electrician, call everybody.

12:50.603 --> 12:53.740
Nothing works in this
lousy place.

12:53.773 --> 12:55.208
So... Hm?

12:55.242 --> 12:57.277
Do you think Lorena is
prettier than me?

12:57.310 --> 12:59.012
What?

12:59.046 --> 13:04.451
Baby, on a scale of like one to
ten, you're like an eleven.

13:04.484 --> 13:05.819
She's like a two.

13:05.853 --> 13:07.821
Well, you said she had a
terrific figure.

13:07.855 --> 13:12.325
My brother was being a jerk to
her. I was trying to say
something nice.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.527
Yeah, it was nice to have
somebody to swim with.

13:14.561 --> 13:15.628
Yeah?

13:15.662 --> 13:17.664
Maybe she'll come over again?

13:17.697 --> 13:19.699
I think I'll ask her.

13:19.732 --> 13:24.204
Sure. You spend too much time
alone. It'll be good to
have a friend.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.512
Hey.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.314
Hm?

15:14.347 --> 15:18.085
Have you noticed a strange girl
hanging under our
building recently?

15:18.118 --> 15:19.686
What... what are you
talking about?

15:19.719 --> 15:22.255
This girl, she
keeps showing up.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
Something about her
really creeps me out.

15:24.591 --> 15:25.792
Like she lives here?

15:25.825 --> 15:27.260
I don't know.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.363
What, like a kid?

15:30.397 --> 15:35.668
No, more like 20. Small, thin,
kind of dark and
dressed in black.

15:35.702 --> 15:38.205
Always wearing this
weird make-up.

15:38.238 --> 15:39.939
Baby, this is that new TL I was
telling you about.

15:39.973 --> 15:41.174
So we're safe, I want to
get one of these.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.976

I'm listening.

20's, always dressed in black,
super thin, crazy make-up.

15:52.385 --> 15:54.487
Well, she doesn't sound
that terrifying.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.656
I'm just asking if
you've seen her.

15:56.689 --> 15:58.525
I haven't seen her.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.920
Hey.

16:27.954 --> 16:32.859
Hey, baby, listen, I hate to
hit you with this, but it's
gonna be a late one over here.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.227
I'm not getting out of
here any time soon.

16:34.261 --> 16:37.030

more late nights.

16:37.064 --> 16:38.698

16:38.731 --> 16:40.333
I get so lonely here.

I know, but I'll make it up to
you, okay? You can count on it.

love you. Bye.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.987
Come on.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.892
Come on, it's okay.

20:53.353 --> 20:56.389
I know what I saw, Ian.

20:56.423 --> 20:59.426
I think it was that girl who's
been following me.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.829
So, what would she be doing in
our house, Bianca?

21:02.862 --> 21:06.466
Look, look.

21:08.768 --> 21:11.738
There were footprints.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.406
They were here.

21:15.575 --> 21:18.878
So, do you want to
call the cops?

21:18.911 --> 21:22.281
I guess there is no point.

21:56.416 --> 21:58.217
I'm worried about you.

21:58.250 --> 22:00.453
I'm fine.

22:04.691 --> 22:06.693
What is it?

22:10.296 --> 22:13.900
It's just with this baby.

22:13.933 --> 22:17.537
Things just haven't been the
same between us since
you got pregnant.

22:17.570 --> 22:23.410
Ssh. You want this... and god
knows, I do, too.

22:23.443 --> 22:28.214
Look, babe, I do, I'm just
worried about you.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.383
I'm concerned for your health.

22:30.417 --> 22:36.723
You mean my mental health,
don't you? I want this child
more than anything.

22:36.756 --> 22:41.794
Losing one was hard enough, I'm
not gonna lose a second.

22:41.828 --> 22:44.764
You just gotta keep taking
your pills, okay?

22:46.365 --> 22:48.968
Okay.

23:24.003 --> 23:26.172
DOCTOR (V.O.) If you continue
to refuse the medication...

23:26.205 --> 23:28.908
We'll have no choice but to
keep you institutionalized.

24:47.353 --> 24:49.021
What do you want?

24:53.993 --> 24:59.231
Why are you after me? Why
are you after me?!

25:01.367 --> 25:03.903
Get away from me!

25:03.936 --> 25:07.940
CREATURE GIRL (V.O.):
Your baby is dying.

25:20.352 --> 25:22.655
B?

25:27.526 --> 25:32.431
You're okay? B?

25:32.464 --> 25:36.135
Do you worry that I might
go crazy again?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.208
Come here.

25:45.311 --> 25:50.950
You're gonna be fine. Just
gotta keep taking them... your
medication, okay?

29:25.031 --> 29:29.635
Are you doing okay in there?

29:29.668 --> 29:31.337
Yeah.

29:32.839 --> 29:35.507
Yeah, I'm almost done.

30:16.682 --> 30:17.649
Ian?

30:17.683 --> 30:18.650
He's that way.

30:18.684 --> 30:19.585
Thank you.

30:29.128 --> 30:33.232
Bianca? Bianca, wait! I was
comforting her.

30:33.265 --> 30:35.101
That's what it's called now,
comforting?

30:35.134 --> 30:38.037
She came into my office and she
was sobbing, okay?

30:38.070 --> 30:40.339
She was going on and on about
Zach, she was making a scene.

30:40.372 --> 30:41.573
The entire dealership,
they were staring...

30:41.607 --> 30:43.175
You had your arms around her.

30:43.209 --> 30:46.913
Yes, I did. I had my arms
around her, because she
was hysterical.

30:46.946 --> 30:51.317
Look, he hit her, Bianca.
He hit her.

30:51.350 --> 30:55.922
She was scared. I was trying
to calm her down.

30:55.955 --> 30:58.424
What was I supposed to do?

31:01.493 --> 31:03.495
What was I supposed to do?

31:07.599 --> 31:09.936
Baby.

31:09.969 --> 31:15.241
Everything seems so... I
just... I need you.

31:15.274 --> 31:18.044
You're always gonna have me.

31:18.077 --> 31:21.547
You're always gonna have me.
Okay?

31:21.580 --> 31:23.382
Okay.

31:27.419 --> 31:30.689
I promise.

31:30.722 --> 31:33.359
ANNOUNCER (V.O.): We begin
tonight with an update in a
missing persons case...

31:33.392 --> 31:36.228
That we've been following for
several days now.

31:36.262 --> 31:39.531
Police still desperately
looking for 21-year-old
Sara Randolph.

31:39.565 --> 31:42.834
ANNOUNCER #2 (V.O.): Randolph
was last seen four days ago
leaving her job...

31:42.868 --> 31:44.770
Ian! Ian!

31:44.803 --> 31:45.938
Yeah!

31:45.972 --> 31:47.539
BIANCA (O.S.): It's her. Who?

31:47.573 --> 31:49.875
The girl, she's on TV. Ian!

31:49.908 --> 31:52.178
What? What? What?

31:52.211 --> 31:56.082
The girl that's been following
me, her picture was just on the
news. She's missing.

31:56.115 --> 31:58.184
Why would a missing girl
be following you?

31:58.217 --> 32:01.053
That's what I don't know, but
it was her, I'm sure.

32:01.087 --> 32:02.989
Okay, so what do you want
to do about it?

32:03.022 --> 32:06.092
I don't know, call the cops?

32:06.125 --> 32:08.360
You really want to
call the cops?

32:08.394 --> 32:12.864
Well, if she's missing, isn't
it my, what do you call it?
Civic duty?

32:12.898 --> 32:14.900
Civic duty? Yeah, to report it.

32:14.933 --> 32:20.973
Um, yeah, it would be, but do
you... do you really want
to call the cops?

32:21.007 --> 32:24.010
I mean, does she ask you for
help or anything?

32:24.043 --> 32:25.277
No, she didn't say anything.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.579
Okay, so why do you want
to call the cops?

32:27.613 --> 32:31.583
What are they gonna send a
bunch of detectives down here
to help you deliver the baby?

32:31.617 --> 32:32.951
They may be good at Lamaze?

32:32.985 --> 32:36.122
No, they are not good
with Lamaze.

32:36.155 --> 32:40.326
Well, but, if she keeps
stalking me, then screw it,
we're gonna call the cops.

32:40.359 --> 32:44.396
We're gonna call the cops.
Okay.

33:26.138 --> 33:28.207
(DOOR CLOSES)

33:34.813 --> 33:37.549
You looking for the girl?

33:37.583 --> 33:40.252
Yeah. I wanted to see if
she's come back yet.

33:40.286 --> 33:43.989
Where are you from, girl? The
islands? Nicaragua?

33:44.022 --> 33:45.257
Brazil.

33:45.291 --> 33:48.760
Brazil? Like Rio de Janeiro,
huh?

33:48.794 --> 33:50.296
Yeah, near Rio.

33:50.329 --> 33:54.866
Okay, Ms. Rio de Janeiro, you
a friend of Sara's?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.268
Yes, I am.

33:56.302 --> 34:00.739
I don't think so.
You're not the type.

34:00.772 --> 34:04.543
Wait! Do you live here?

34:04.576 --> 34:09.547
I own the place. Four above
and a shop below.

34:09.581 --> 34:12.118
Please, please.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.453
Please, it's really important
that I find Sara.

34:14.485 --> 34:18.290
I already told the cops
everything I know.

34:20.025 --> 34:22.428
Please, sir, I...

34:32.638 --> 34:36.041
Hey, you like cats?

34:36.074 --> 34:37.509
No, not really.

34:37.543 --> 34:39.978
Well, me, neither, but your
friend gave it to me.

34:40.011 --> 34:44.815
She's messed up, but she loves
cats. She gave me this just
before she disappeared.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.485
Why? Was she worried that
something bad might
happen to her?

34:47.518 --> 34:51.290
Take this cat off my hands
here. Hold it. See?

34:51.322 --> 34:55.893
You take this cat off my hands
and I'll tell you everything
I told the cops.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.497
I can't bring home a cat.

34:58.530 --> 35:03.101
Well, that's too bad. Probably
have to put the
little sucker down.

35:26.225 --> 35:28.294
Okay, you've got a deal.

35:28.327 --> 35:33.765
Oh, what a lovely
pussycat you are.

35:33.799 --> 35:39.371
Okay, the last time I saw Sara,
she was looking for a lawyer.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.673
I thought she'd gotten into
trouble again, she said...

35:41.707 --> 35:47.946
"No, man, not that kind of
lawyer. I'm movin' up
in the world."

35:47.979 --> 35:49.915
Then she gave me that cat
to take care of.

35:49.948 --> 35:54.686
I don't know what she was
thinking? She was always,
you know...

35:57.189 --> 35:58.224
That's it?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.292
That's it. That's it.

36:00.326 --> 36:04.095
But, you know what? I'm gonna
give you one of these to
go with your cat.

36:04.129 --> 36:05.997
Merry Christmas.

36:06.031 --> 36:08.300
Take it, it's look
good on the tree.

36:08.334 --> 36:09.901
Thank you. How much is it?

36:09.935 --> 36:10.902
Nothing.

36:10.936 --> 36:11.903
Thank you.

36:11.937 --> 36:16.508
You're welcome. Bye.

36:16.542 --> 36:21.680
We're gonna go home now, okay?
Just let me get the key.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.785
Baby.

36:36.094 --> 36:37.763
Kitty! What's wrong?

36:37.796 --> 36:41.433
Excuse me, is this yours?

36:42.268 --> 36:44.503
Why are you following me?

36:44.536 --> 36:47.306
Detective Williams,
Savannah Police.

36:47.339 --> 36:52.478
Why don't you and I grab a cup
of coffee? Let's go.

36:52.511 --> 36:55.381
Does the name Sara Randolph
mean anything to you?

36:55.414 --> 36:57.883
Yes. Yes, it does.

36:57.916 --> 36:59.785
Did she give you the earring?

36:59.818 --> 37:01.353
No.

37:01.387 --> 37:03.422
Did you visit her the night
she disappeared?

37:03.455 --> 37:04.490
No.

37:04.523 --> 37:06.525
So you can tell me why your
car was seen...

37:06.558 --> 37:08.960
In front of her apartment
building the night
she disappeared?

37:08.994 --> 37:10.329
I have no idea.

37:10.362 --> 37:11.830
You didn't drive to her
apartment that night?

37:11.863 --> 37:13.332
No, I did not.

37:14.900 --> 37:20.706
Here we go. I'll be back.

37:26.177 --> 37:31.450
How do you describe the
relationship between you and
your husband and Miss Randolph?

37:31.483 --> 37:34.486
There is no relationship.
We don't know her.

37:36.988 --> 37:39.325
You recognize this place?

37:39.358 --> 37:47.299
Yes, it's Ian's family's house
in Hilton Head. This is Ian,
Zach, their parents.

37:47.333 --> 37:49.735
And do you know who
these people are?

37:49.768 --> 37:51.202
No, I don't.

37:51.236 --> 37:54.606
Sara Randolph and her mother
Elsa, the housekeeper.

37:56.141 --> 37:59.845
Elsa was the housekeeper for
the family for over 20 years.

37:59.878 --> 38:04.616
She was fired. She moved to
Atlanta and died soon after.

38:04.650 --> 38:06.652
Your husband never told
you about this?

38:06.685 --> 38:09.521
No, Ian doesn't talk
about his childhood.

38:09.555 --> 38:12.624
His mother is dead and he was
estranged from his father.

38:12.658 --> 38:16.294
They never talked, not even
before his dad died.

38:16.328 --> 38:17.696
You know nothing about Sara?

38:17.729 --> 38:18.864
No.

38:18.897 --> 38:21.500
Yet, when I mentioned her name,
you recognized it.

38:21.533 --> 38:25.671
I saw her picture on the news.
I felt... bad for her.

38:25.704 --> 38:26.472
That's it?

38:26.505 --> 38:28.139
Yes. That's it.

38:28.173 --> 38:30.509
And the earring? You know she
had one just like that, right?

38:34.946 --> 38:39.451
I saw it in a store yesterday.
It attracted me.

38:39.485 --> 38:42.153
I don't know, maybe I remember
seeing it on her?

38:42.187 --> 38:44.055
On her?

38:44.089 --> 38:48.460
On a picture on the news. I'm
tired, I want to go home now.

38:50.362 --> 38:52.931
I'll drive you back.

39:04.976 --> 39:09.347
Mrs. Wood, what are you so
afraid of? You can tell me.

39:09.381 --> 39:12.117
I don't know what you're
talking about.

39:12.150 --> 39:13.952
You sure?

39:13.985 --> 39:15.721
Yes, I'm sure.

39:18.690 --> 39:23.862
Mrs. Wood, most people in this
city wouldn't care about
someone like Sara Randolph.

39:23.895 --> 39:28.333
Poor, daughter of a maid, she
might as well not exist.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.603
Well, maybe we're not
most people.

39:33.672 --> 39:37.943
Good luck with the baby.
It's a blessing.

39:49.220 --> 39:54.560
Hey! There you are. Kitty!
Come back here!

39:55.661 --> 39:56.562
Kitty!

40:24.089 --> 40:27.726
Wait! I know who you are!

40:27.759 --> 40:29.595
BIANCA (O.S.): Please, I
want to talk to you.

41:00.225 --> 41:01.593
Hey!

41:09.467 --> 41:11.169
Wait, please!

41:14.806 --> 41:16.575
CAPTAIN (O.S.): All aboard!

42:02.588 --> 42:06.124
Wait! Please wait!

42:10.061 --> 42:13.765
Wait, please! I just want
to talk to you.

42:58.910 --> 43:02.313
CREATURE GIRL (V.O.):
Come to me.

43:20.131 --> 43:23.168
Come closer. Closer.

43:45.490 --> 43:47.325
Let there be light.

43:47.358 --> 43:49.828
Hey! So, good news on
the probate.

43:49.861 --> 43:52.831
Got a court order to
evict the tenants.

43:52.864 --> 43:55.400
What the hell is going on?

43:55.433 --> 43:56.735
What are you talking about?

43:56.768 --> 43:58.804
I'm your wife, about to have
a child together.

43:58.837 --> 44:02.240
If something is wrong, you have
to trust me enough to tell me.

44:02.273 --> 44:04.609
Okay, what do you mean?

44:04.642 --> 44:07.445
Sara Randolph?

44:07.478 --> 44:08.446
What?

44:08.479 --> 44:10.215
Don't.

44:10.248 --> 44:16.287
The police showed me a photo of
you, Zach and Sara.

44:16.321 --> 44:21.092
Sorry, I haven't heard Sara
Randolph's name in years. She
was the maid's kid.

44:21.126 --> 44:23.161
Why are the police showing
you a photo of her?

44:23.194 --> 44:27.265
She's the missing girl, the one
who's been following me.

44:27.298 --> 44:28.734
What?

44:28.767 --> 44:32.103
Yeah, and I think she's dead.

44:32.137 --> 44:33.939
How can she be following
you if she's dead?

44:33.972 --> 44:36.341
She led me to this terrible
place, it was awful.

44:36.374 --> 44:39.544
She's dead. How can she lead
you anywhere, Bianca?

44:39.577 --> 44:41.579
It was her ghost. I saw her.

44:41.612 --> 44:43.348
She wants something from me.

44:43.381 --> 44:45.583
I don't know what. I don't know
why she's chosen me.

44:45.616 --> 44:48.754
Maybe because you knew her when
you were kids, she feels
she can trust me.

44:48.787 --> 44:50.321
Okay, Bianca.

44:51.656 --> 44:52.924
Bianca, you taking
your medication?

44:52.958 --> 44:54.459
This has nothing to
do with that.

44:54.492 --> 44:55.560
When did you stop taking it?

44:55.593 --> 44:56.561
It doesn't matter!

44:56.594 --> 44:58.563
When!?

44:58.596 --> 45:02.300
I started getting the pains, I
thought the meds were
hurting the baby.

45:04.135 --> 45:06.337
Oh, my god.

45:14.545 --> 45:18.850
You are imagining these things.
Okay?

45:18.884 --> 45:21.519
You're having
hallucinations again.

45:21.552 --> 45:23.789
I know what I saw. It was real.

45:23.822 --> 45:27.959
You think it seems real, but
what you saw does not exist.

45:27.993 --> 45:29.861
It's just like after
the miscarriage.

45:29.895 --> 45:32.163
That's why they put you on the
meds in the first place.

45:32.197 --> 45:34.499
Now you gotta start
taking them.

45:34.532 --> 45:37.903
Right away, or they're gonna
put you back in the psych ward.

45:37.936 --> 45:40.105
I've started taking them again.

45:40.138 --> 45:44.375
Good, because we don't want the
police to take you away
from our baby.

45:44.409 --> 45:47.212
They can't do that. You
don't let them.

45:47.245 --> 45:51.616
I may not have a choice, if
you're talking like this.

45:51.649 --> 45:54.786
Because ghosts do not exist.

45:54.820 --> 45:56.855
You gotta stop talking
like this, okay?

45:56.888 --> 46:00.058
You gotta knock this shit off,
for all of our sakes.

46:00.091 --> 46:04.062
Ian, I'm so scared.
What's wrong with me?

46:04.095 --> 46:11.036
It's okay. It's gonna be okay.
Come on. Come on.

46:20.511 --> 46:22.881
I'll go make you some tea.

46:53.344 --> 46:55.180
Drink this.

47:02.954 --> 47:05.823
Just take a little more.

47:05.857 --> 47:08.426
Come on, take a bit more.

47:19.905 --> 47:28.479
Ian... our car was outside
Sara's apartment the night
she disappeared.

47:34.652 --> 47:38.589
Our car...

48:08.286 --> 48:09.720
Ian?

48:09.754 --> 48:10.788
What? What's wrong?

48:10.821 --> 48:13.524
Where am I?

48:13.558 --> 48:16.661
That's very funny.

48:16.694 --> 48:17.662
Stop!

48:19.764 --> 48:21.366
What? What? What?
You're hurting me.

48:21.399 --> 48:22.567
What?

48:24.835 --> 48:30.175
Oh, my god, I just had the
strangest dream.

48:30.208 --> 48:33.578
I was pregnant with our child...

48:33.611 --> 48:40.551
Don't get any ideas, babe. I
don't need any more pregnant
women in my life, all right?

48:40.585 --> 48:41.586
I don't feel very well.

48:41.619 --> 48:42.620
What?

48:42.653 --> 48:44.189
I don't feel well.

48:46.491 --> 48:48.960
Hey! Where you going?

48:52.630 --> 48:56.367
IAN (O.S.): What are you doing?
Come back to bed.

48:56.401 --> 48:58.703
IAN (O.S.): Lorena!

49:08.813 --> 49:11.282
Ian?

49:18.656 --> 49:20.625
Ian, you son of a bitch!

49:20.658 --> 49:21.659
What?

49:21.692 --> 49:22.860
You've been screwing her!

49:22.893 --> 49:24.029
What? What? Stop! Stop!

49:24.062 --> 49:25.263
How could you? Stop!

49:25.296 --> 49:27.232
I saw you having sex
with Lorena!

49:27.265 --> 49:28.899
Stop! I've been
sleeping on the couch.

49:28.933 --> 49:30.068
Stop! Stop! You had
a bad dream.

49:30.101 --> 49:34.372
You had a bad dream. Stop.

49:34.405 --> 49:38.876
You had a bad dream. You're
okay. Come on, let's
go back to bed.

49:38.909 --> 49:39.910
Okay.

49:39.944 --> 49:42.280
Let's go back to bed.

49:42.313 --> 49:46.251
CREATURE GIRL (V.O.): You
must do what I say.

49:51.422 --> 49:58.529
CREATURE GIRL (V.O.): Do what I
say, then you won't die.

50:25.390 --> 50:28.726
I let all my tenants store
their stuff down here.

50:28.759 --> 50:32.197
This was hers.

50:32.230 --> 50:34.365
Let's see if her key fits.

50:34.399 --> 50:38.236
Are you sure this is okay? I
don't want to get
you in trouble.

50:38.269 --> 50:43.074
Well, the police made me keep
everybody out of her apartment.

50:43.108 --> 50:45.710
They should have been
more specific.

51:00.225 --> 51:01.726
What are you looking for?

51:01.759 --> 51:03.228
I'm not sure.

51:26.984 --> 51:34.159
Hey. What's this?

51:54.445 --> 51:59.350
My daughter, Sara
Marie Randolph.

51:59.384 --> 52:04.789
Not what you expected, huh?

52:14.031 --> 52:16.501
IAN (O.S.): If you didn't tell
her, how the fuck
does she know?

52:16.534 --> 52:20.505
Beats me, maybe you talk
in your sleep.

52:23.274 --> 52:25.743
I'm just glad she
finally knows.

52:25.776 --> 52:27.478
She doesn't.

52:27.512 --> 52:30.581
I convinced her she was
imagining things.

52:30.615 --> 52:32.650
Well, you gotta tell
her sometime.

52:32.683 --> 52:35.052
I'm not gonna wait
around much longer.

52:35.085 --> 52:40.425
No. No. This was a mistake,
Lorena.

52:40.458 --> 52:46.163
Oh, hm, it didn't seem
like a mistake.

52:46.197 --> 52:53.438
Not from the way you were
screaming with joy.

52:53.471 --> 52:56.641
You never had it like that
before, did you, honey?

52:56.674 --> 53:03.414
You know, you can have some of
that every night for the
rest of your life.

53:06.884 --> 53:10.788
You know, I can't stand another
minute with your
bastard brother.

53:10.821 --> 53:14.659
And you can't tell me you want
to go back to that
foreign nut job.

53:16.494 --> 53:19.697
Well, if you don't tell her
about us, I will.

53:19.730 --> 53:20.731
Ow!

53:20.765 --> 53:23.468
Shut your fucking mouth!

53:33.177 --> 53:34.412
What's going on?

53:34.445 --> 53:38.549
Zach! What are you doing home,
honey?

53:38.583 --> 53:41.151
Got some things I need to talk
to my brother about.

53:41.185 --> 53:43.421
What kind of things?

53:43.454 --> 53:47.224
Just shut up, you fucking
whore! Get in the bedroom.

53:47.258 --> 53:49.327
Fuck you!

54:14.184 --> 54:15.453
Get in the fucking room!

54:15.486 --> 54:17.755
Hey!

54:17.788 --> 54:21.826
Get the fuck in the bedroom,
you goddamn...

54:34.705 --> 54:40.345
So what's going on between you
two? You fucking her? Huh?

54:42.647 --> 54:45.350
Nothing.

54:45.383 --> 54:49.186
You're always getting worked
up over nothing.

54:49.219 --> 54:50.588
Just like you are
with these cops.

54:50.621 --> 54:54.325
Nothing? The cops got
us tied to Sara.

54:54.359 --> 54:56.661
So what? What's the matter,
huh?

54:56.694 --> 54:59.296
Because your fucking wife is
shouting her big,
fucking mouth off!

54:59.330 --> 55:02.633
She's seeing ghosts. You think
anybody's gonna listen to what
she says right now?

55:02.667 --> 55:06.537
Yeah. If the lawyer walks off
the deal, we're fucked!

55:06.571 --> 55:10.174
So you either shut her
up or I will!

55:10.207 --> 55:11.942
Don't you threaten my wife.

55:11.976 --> 55:15.145
Fuck you, Ian.

55:15.179 --> 55:16.847
We're not kids any more, Zach.

55:16.881 --> 55:23.253
Yeah, we're not. I'll bash
your fucking head in!

55:23.287 --> 55:27.358
Then you keep all the money,
brother?

55:42.172 --> 55:43.974
Hello?

55:44.008 --> 55:48.946
Bianca, we've gotta meet
somewhere. I've got
lots to tell you.

55:48.979 --> 55:54.118
It's okay, you don't have to
talk, just listen.

55:54.151 --> 55:57.121
Ian's leaving you for me.

55:57.154 --> 56:01.992
(SPEAKING PORTUGUESE)

56:02.026 --> 56:04.495
Speak English, I can't
understand a word...

56:04.529 --> 56:06.731
I said you are a tramp.

56:06.764 --> 56:10.367
Oh, Ian and I are out of here
just as soon as the money
comes through.

56:10.401 --> 56:12.703
There is no money! They've
been lying all along.

56:12.737 --> 56:13.504
(LOUD CRASH)

56:13.538 --> 56:15.640
I found the real will.

56:15.673 --> 56:18.876
Everything was left to Sara,
their half-sister.

56:18.909 --> 56:21.479
They forged the new one.

56:21.512 --> 56:23.614
What Ian said about you...

56:30.154 --> 56:31.456
Lorena?

56:32.122 --> 56:34.091
Lorena? Lorena?

56:57.882 --> 57:00.918
Lorena?

57:22.106 --> 57:25.976
I could be wrong about your
husband. The story he's telling
is very convincing.

57:26.010 --> 57:27.444
He's here?

57:27.478 --> 57:29.446
Next room down. He's being
very cooperative.

57:29.480 --> 57:32.116
According to him, you were
jealous of Lorena.

57:32.149 --> 57:37.021
You accused him of having an
affair. Made a few threats.
Not threats...

57:37.054 --> 57:41.626
He says you've gone off your
meds and that's made you
imagine things.

57:41.659 --> 57:44.361
Are you on lithium
right now or not?

57:44.394 --> 57:45.896
Yes.

57:45.930 --> 57:47.331
Yes, you are?

57:47.364 --> 57:50.635
Yes. No.

57:50.668 --> 57:53.738
No, you're not.

57:57.307 --> 57:59.644
Are you okay?

57:59.677 --> 58:01.646
I get these pains, that's why.

58:01.679 --> 58:05.149
That's why what?

58:05.182 --> 58:07.685
It's nothing.

58:07.718 --> 58:10.921
Okay. According to your
phone records...

58:10.955 --> 58:14.491
You were in the Savannah
Gardens area when you got a
call from Lorena.

58:14.525 --> 58:16.927
Now that's Sara
Randolph's neighborhood.

58:16.961 --> 58:18.696
Is it?

58:18.729 --> 58:24.869
Look, I told you I had nothing
to do with Sara. Am
I a suspect?

58:24.902 --> 58:31.175
Do I need a lawyer? Because if
not, I'd like to go.

58:31.208 --> 58:34.645
Look, I don't know what kind of
games you and your
husband are up to.

58:34.679 --> 58:36.747
But if I were you, I'd
be very careful.

58:36.781 --> 58:41.351
I got two people dead and don't
want another and I still got a
pregnant girl missing.

58:41.385 --> 58:43.253
Pregnant?

58:43.287 --> 58:48.693
Yeah, Sara Randolph was three
months pregnant when
she disappeared.

59:27.131 --> 59:30.267
Please.

59:37.341 --> 59:39.677
Leave my baby alone.

59:39.710 --> 59:40.978
Okay, come on.

59:41.011 --> 59:45.883
Have mercy! Don't you touch me!

59:59.964 --> 01:00:02.332
I'm gonna make you disappear.

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.406
I'm gonna make you go
away forever.

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:10.607
Yeah, right.

01:00:21.952 --> 01:00:26.190
Kill Ian Wood. Kill Ian Wood.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:32.196
Just Bianca... kill Ian Wood or
your baby will die.

01:00:41.538 --> 01:00:46.310
Ecclesiastes: For who can say
what is good for a person
in his life...

01:00:46.343 --> 01:00:51.248
During the few and meaningless
days he passes through
like a shadow?

01:00:51.281 --> 01:00:56.020
All go to the same place; all
come from dust...

01:00:56.053 --> 01:01:00.590
And it is to dust that we
shall all return.

01:01:00.624 --> 01:01:05.930
Naked comes a man from his
mother's womb, and as he so
comes, so he will depart.

01:01:10.901 --> 01:01:13.337
Who will tell him
what is to come?

01:01:13.370 --> 01:01:17.407
Not one of us has power over
the wind to contain it.

01:01:17.441 --> 01:01:23.680
And so not one of us has power
over the day of his death.

01:01:37.694 --> 01:01:42.432
Of the son of the Holy Spirit.
Amen.

01:01:54.278 --> 01:01:59.850
CREATURE GIRL (V.O.): Listen to
me. This is your last chance.
Kill Ian Wood.

01:01:59.884 --> 01:02:05.289
It's time to go, Bianca.
Let's go.

01:02:05.322 --> 01:02:07.624
No. I won't go with you.

01:02:07.657 --> 01:02:10.727
Excuse me?

01:02:10.761 --> 01:02:16.166
I'm afraid of what I
might do to you.

01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:17.567
Get in the car.

01:02:17.601 --> 01:02:20.871
No, I have to go somewhere
safe for my baby.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:22.672
Far away from all of you.

01:02:22.706 --> 01:02:25.075
Get in the fucking car.

01:02:25.109 --> 01:02:30.380
I know everything. I saw
the real will.

01:02:30.414 --> 01:02:34.584
Sara was your half-sister. Your
father left her everything.

01:02:34.618 --> 01:02:37.822
And you killed her
for the money.

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.090
You killed your brother, too.

01:02:40.124 --> 01:02:41.859
Where is it?

01:02:44.761 --> 01:02:48.032
Where's the fucking will?

01:03:46.690 --> 01:03:51.528
(GIRL LAUGHING)

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:56.833
You're such a fool. I'll never
let you get away.

01:04:01.571 --> 01:04:05.842
It hurts, huh? Why should you
get a baby when I can't?

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:12.349
This is your last warning.
Your baby is dying.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.505
Relax.

01:04:38.642 --> 01:04:40.244
She's gonna take my baby.

01:04:40.277 --> 01:04:42.646
No one's trying to
get your baby.

01:04:46.483 --> 01:04:48.953
Breathe, Bianca. Breathe.

01:04:50.854 --> 01:04:53.924
Try to relax.

01:04:57.827 --> 01:04:58.929
(EKG BEEPING)

01:04:58.963 --> 01:05:00.931
We're dropping.

01:05:00.965 --> 01:05:03.867
We have to turn it around.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.071
(SCREAMING)

01:05:07.104 --> 01:05:08.305
She's hemorrhaging.

01:05:10.774 --> 01:05:13.243
Relax, Bianca. Just breathe.

01:05:25.889 --> 01:05:27.191
Bianca, wake up!

01:05:37.767 --> 01:05:39.269
I was bleeding.

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:43.407
We stopped it.
You're very lucky.

01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:44.841
The baby?

01:05:44.874 --> 01:05:49.446
She's fine.

01:05:49.479 --> 01:05:51.948
She?

01:05:51.982 --> 01:05:54.284
Oh, Bianca, I'm so sorry. I
completely forgot.

01:05:54.318 --> 01:05:58.122
Don't worry... I knew it
would be a girl.

01:05:58.155 --> 01:06:02.226
You kept saying someone was
trying to take her from you.

01:06:02.259 --> 01:06:04.561
Who do you think that is?

01:06:04.594 --> 01:06:10.334
You can't tell Ian that I'm
here. My life depends on it.

01:06:13.070 --> 01:06:15.605
This is gonna sound crazy.

01:06:15.639 --> 01:06:20.944
I know I've had my problems in
the past, but you have
to believe me.

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:23.013
It's true.

01:06:32.889 --> 01:06:34.591
You're gonna be okay.

01:06:40.364 --> 01:06:42.399
I brought you a
change of clothes.

01:07:33.917 --> 01:07:35.785
Ian?

01:07:40.257 --> 01:07:43.193
We're going to release her into
your care for now...

01:07:43.227 --> 01:07:45.629
But you have to make sure she
takes the lithium.

01:07:45.662 --> 01:07:49.699
Otherwise, she won't stop
having hallucinations
and terrors.

01:07:49.733 --> 01:07:52.369
And then god knows what could
happen to her, and the baby.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:08:00.210
I understand. I'll make sure
she keeps taking it. Thank you.

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.383
Open the fucking door!

01:09:33.237 --> 01:09:39.309
I can't take this any more.
Please forgive me.

01:09:50.654 --> 01:09:55.825
Please help me. I'll do
whatever you want.

01:09:55.859 --> 01:09:58.262
Please?

01:10:01.398 --> 01:10:05.201
SARA (V.O.): I'll make
it better now.

01:10:05.235 --> 01:10:07.304
But see what they did to me.

01:10:09.339 --> 01:10:11.475
They were so cold.

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:16.212
My baby woke me.

01:10:16.813 --> 01:10:20.317
Oh, jeez!

01:10:20.350 --> 01:10:22.919
How the fuck is she alive?
She's still alive.

01:10:22.952 --> 01:10:26.890
SARA (V.O.): They were my
brothers. I begged them.

01:10:26.923 --> 01:10:29.125
Stand back.

01:10:29.158 --> 01:10:33.430
SARA (V.O.): I begged them for
my baby, not for me. I begged
them not to kill my baby.

01:10:33.463 --> 01:10:38.302
But they didn't listen.
They didn't listen!

01:10:49.613 --> 01:10:51.915
You have to make it right.

01:10:54.584 --> 01:10:57.621
You have to avenge my baby.

01:11:03.827 --> 01:11:07.597
(PHONE RINGS)

01:11:23.447 --> 01:11:27.551
Bianca? Where are you?

01:11:27.584 --> 01:11:31.287
I'm here, where you
killed Sara.

01:11:31.321 --> 01:11:33.256
I have the will with me.

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:37.794
If you don't come, I'll
go to the police.

01:11:37.827 --> 01:11:39.329
I'm coming.

01:14:47.050 --> 01:14:51.120
Jesus Christ! You're out of
your goddamn mind.

01:14:52.989 --> 01:14:59.596
She said I have to do to you
the same thing you did to her.

01:14:59.629 --> 01:15:01.898
Don't do this, Bianca.

01:15:09.573 --> 01:15:11.641
Don't do this.

01:15:11.675 --> 01:15:14.878
Don't do this, Bianca, please,
I goddamn beg you, please
do not do this.

01:15:14.911 --> 01:15:18.815
If I don't do it, she wants
to take my baby.

01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:21.184
Please don't, I goddamn beg
you, don't do this!

01:15:23.186 --> 01:15:27.090
Don't do this! Just please,
stop! I'm begging you, stop!

01:15:27.123 --> 01:15:29.458
Just stop okay?

01:15:29.492 --> 01:15:32.696
I didn't have a choice. I
did this for us.

01:15:32.729 --> 01:15:35.264
I did it for the baby.

01:15:36.499 --> 01:15:40.604
No, you didn't. I loved you.

01:15:40.637 --> 01:15:43.106
I gave up everything for you.

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:49.679
I didn't need any money. I
thought we were happy.

01:15:49.713 --> 01:15:52.649
I just wanted us to
have a family.

01:15:52.682 --> 01:15:56.152
And you came and
ruined everything.

01:15:56.185 --> 01:15:58.822
I'm sorry.

01:16:20.644 --> 01:16:25.148
You stupid, fucking bitch!

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:33.489
Do you think I wanted any of
this? Do you think I
wanted to kill her?

01:16:33.522 --> 01:16:39.062
I tried to talk to her. I tried
to get her to understand
what they did to us.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:45.134
That the money belonged to us.
She didn't understand.

01:16:45.168 --> 01:16:51.207
You... had to go digging.

01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:54.177
You couldn't just let the
broad stay dead?

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:08.792
Where's the will?

01:17:15.631 --> 01:17:18.367
Where's the fucking will?!

01:17:21.437 --> 01:17:27.376
Help me! Help me!

01:17:27.410 --> 01:17:31.180
There's no one here to help
you! There's nothing there!

01:17:33.316 --> 01:17:35.184
Where's the will?

01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.322
You promised!

01:17:39.355 --> 01:17:41.691
IAN (O.S.): The fucking will!

01:17:55.538 --> 01:18:01.110
You killed my baby.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:07.516
No, Bianca, don't!

01:18:07.550 --> 01:18:08.684
No!

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:46.555
The gruesome story
continues to unfold...

01:18:46.589 --> 01:18:49.658
Since last night's discovery
under the pier by the
Savannah River.

01:18:49.692 --> 01:18:54.964
31-year-old Ian Wood was killed
during a confrontation
involving his wife
Bianca and police.

01:18:54.998 --> 01:19:00.904
Ian was a prime suspect in
three murders, including that
of his half-sister
Sara Randolph.

01:19:00.937 --> 01:19:03.406
His wife, Bianca Wood, five
months pregnant...

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:08.778
Was also wounded and remains in
critical condition, though is
expected to survive.

01:19:08.812 --> 01:19:12.215
Police tell WTOC they found
body parts under the pier...

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:15.885
And have confirmed that they
are in fact Sara Randolph's.

01:19:15.919 --> 01:19:19.388
A spokesman for the police
department says they think...

01:19:19.422 --> 01:19:23.492
We have a gunshot wound to her
left shoulder, a 24-year-old,
contusions to the face.

01:19:23.526 --> 01:19:28.497
Officers believe that she was
assaulted... possibly assaulted
by her husband. Baby is stable.

01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:30.834
All his vitals look good.

01:19:33.903 --> 01:19:41.044
Bianca? Do you know where you
are right now? Bianca?

01:19:42.979 --> 01:19:51.020
SARA (V.O.): Bianca, see
what I can see.

01:19:51.054 --> 01:19:54.090
DOCTOR MAUER (O.S.): Hi,
Bianca, I'm Dr. Mauer.

01:19:54.123 --> 01:19:59.528
We're gonna take care of you
now. Everything is gonna be all
right. The baby is fine.
