WEBVTT

00:01.430 --> 00:03.830
DOMINIC:
You're lying again.
Just admit it.

00:04.030 --> 00:06.360
You're paranoid. And crazy.
I've done nothing wrong.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.930
It was Josh from Accounting
this time, right?

00:09.130 --> 00:10.450
My God, I made
one mistake in college,

00:10.650 --> 00:11.970
and you still think
the worst of me.

00:12.170 --> 00:13.580
Because you keep
proving me right.

00:13.780 --> 00:17.670
If we can just focus on
the terms of the divorce.

00:17.870 --> 00:19.940
I want half
of Dixie's company.

00:20.140 --> 00:21.330
As payback.

00:21.530 --> 00:22.940
Wha... Half?

00:23.140 --> 00:24.070
At least half.

00:24.270 --> 00:25.290
Dominic was there
from the beginning.

00:25.490 --> 00:26.810
You have got
to be kidding me.

00:27.010 --> 00:28.030
DOMINIC:
That is what you
get for lying...

00:28.230 --> 00:29.690
Are you...
This is my company!

00:29.890 --> 00:32.040
[overlapping shouting]

00:32.240 --> 00:33.560
MARAGARET:
Please, let's
just calm down.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.470
Now if we could all
just agree on a settlement,

00:35.670 --> 00:38.290
we can move on
with our lives, okay?

00:39.470 --> 00:41.650
You said you could
secure something fair.

00:41.850 --> 00:43.790
Half is not fair.

00:43.990 --> 00:45.180
I built Solafide
from the ground up.

00:45.380 --> 00:47.050
Me. And I sure
as hell am not

00:47.250 --> 00:48.790
gonna give him half
of everything I built.

00:48.990 --> 00:51.010
WOMAN:
Margaret.

00:51.210 --> 00:53.530
Do you have a moment?

00:55.050 --> 00:56.710
Beverly.

00:56.910 --> 00:59.890
Yes. Uh, everyone,
this is Beverly Crest

01:00.090 --> 01:01.540
of Crest,
Folding & Song.

01:01.740 --> 01:03.070
Um, we'll just take ten,

01:03.270 --> 01:06.110
and I'll be... right back.

01:06.310 --> 01:08.160
Uh, Beverly,

01:08.360 --> 01:10.860
I didn't realize that
you were back from Carnevale.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.080
Dixie Kimble brought
us her divorce.

01:13.280 --> 01:14.430
And I have it
under control.

01:14.630 --> 01:15.560
With the expectation

01:15.760 --> 01:17.040
that if we satisfied her,

01:17.240 --> 01:18.870
we could expect
Solafide's business,

01:19.060 --> 01:22.300
her $70 million sporting
goods corporation.

01:22.500 --> 01:24.440
Beverly, you yourself told me

01:24.640 --> 01:26.050
that every acrimonious divorce

01:26.250 --> 01:27.660
has a day in the middle
of negotiations

01:27.860 --> 01:30.830
when things fall apart.
[chuckles]

01:31.030 --> 01:32.400
Today is that day.Then you need to

01:32.600 --> 01:33.920
move through it quicker,
before she gets fed up

01:34.120 --> 01:35.440
and walks her high-maintenance
butt out that door.

01:37.350 --> 01:39.630
A named partner
wouldn't let this feather

01:39.820 --> 01:41.370
slip from her cap.

01:41.570 --> 01:44.330
That's what you want,
isn't it?

01:44.530 --> 01:46.940
To be a named partner here?

01:47.140 --> 01:50.020
Crest, Folding, Song & Wright?

01:51.060 --> 01:53.250
I do want that, yes.

01:53.450 --> 01:56.030
You know I do.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.690
And while you were abroad,

01:57.890 --> 02:01.170
I added the mayor and
the governor to my client list.

02:01.370 --> 02:02.600
This hiccup today...

02:02.800 --> 02:04.870
This hiccup tells me
that you are not a killer.

02:05.070 --> 02:06.520
You're good,

02:06.720 --> 02:09.090
but that client needs you
to go for the jugular.

02:09.290 --> 02:11.180
That's what

02:11.380 --> 02:12.220
puts your name
on the letterhead,

02:12.420 --> 02:14.180
not holding people's hands

02:14.380 --> 02:15.880
and letting them
cry on your shoulder.

02:16.080 --> 02:17.920
That puts you
out in Siberia.

02:18.120 --> 02:19.360
Are we clear?

02:19.560 --> 02:20.660
Yes.

02:24.310 --> 02:27.410
[watch beeps]Okay, there are 16, 17,

02:27.610 --> 02:29.280
18 cupcakes here in--

02:29.480 --> 02:30.940
and I want to be
very clear about this--

02:31.140 --> 02:33.200
an unmarked box
with no name, no date,

02:33.400 --> 02:35.030
so this recording
will serve as testimony

02:35.230 --> 02:36.290
to the fact that I, in fact,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.420
did consider
the moral consequences

02:38.620 --> 02:41.120
of me liberating one of these
delicious-looking cupcakes

02:41.320 --> 02:44.120
from this box with my mouth.

02:44.320 --> 02:46.040
MARGARET:
Todd.

02:46.240 --> 02:47.210
I need your help.

02:47.410 --> 02:48.430
Uh, what? Help with what?

02:48.630 --> 02:50.520
What is going on?
You look... Are you okay?

02:50.720 --> 02:52.350
I need to know that
someone isn't cheating.

02:52.550 --> 02:54.400
Isn't cheating?
You know, typically,

02:54.600 --> 02:56.180
investigators are asked to
find out if someone is...

02:56.380 --> 02:57.660
Todd.
Okay, you want me

02:57.860 --> 02:59.310
to prove a negative.

02:59.510 --> 03:00.400
I want you to do what I ask.

03:00.600 --> 03:03.100
Get proof
that a woman

03:03.300 --> 03:05.750
is not sleeping
with her employees.

03:05.950 --> 03:07.150
And...

03:07.350 --> 03:09.540
and look into
her husband.
Mm-hmm.

03:09.740 --> 03:11.200
And go for the jugular.

03:11.390 --> 03:12.630
I want dirt.

03:12.830 --> 03:14.940
I want all the dirt.
I want lots of dirt.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.160
Okay, so you want me
to kill him.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.160
Yes. No! I want dirt, not death.

03:18.360 --> 03:20.070
Well, typically,
the dead are buried in dirt.

03:20.270 --> 03:21.940
Oh, Todd, stop fooling around.

03:22.140 --> 03:23.030
Just go get
the information

03:23.230 --> 03:24.560
on Dominic and Dixie Kimble

03:24.760 --> 03:27.070
from Francey, and get to work.

03:28.330 --> 03:29.210
Todd,

03:29.410 --> 03:30.430
you did not

03:30.630 --> 03:32.170
eat one of those
cupcakes, did you?

03:32.370 --> 03:33.610
It's Bob's birthday.

03:33.810 --> 03:34.780
No, I did not eat one.

03:34.980 --> 03:36.310
I could have,
but I did not,

03:36.510 --> 03:37.400
and I have
recorded testimony

03:37.590 --> 03:38.660
supporting that fact.

03:38.860 --> 03:39.790
Just go.

03:39.990 --> 03:41.180
Work. Sleuth. Now.

03:41.380 --> 03:42.650
Okay.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.410
Todd.

03:47.600 --> 03:48.450
Veronica?

03:48.650 --> 03:50.020
What are you...
You're in jail.

03:50.220 --> 03:51.020
No, not anymore.

03:51.220 --> 03:52.280
You have
eight more years...

03:52.480 --> 03:53.800
They let me out.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.330
You have eight more years
left in jail.

03:55.530 --> 03:56.410
Todd, I need your help.

03:56.610 --> 03:58.330
Uh, yeah, okay, no.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.630
How did you even get out?

03:59.830 --> 04:01.330
[sighs]
Do you remember Luke Anten?

04:01.530 --> 04:03.250
The corrupt cop?
The case that...

04:03.450 --> 04:04.290
That I helped you solve.

04:04.490 --> 04:05.600
Yeah.Right, the D.A.

04:05.800 --> 04:07.210
came to me,
asking for information.

04:07.410 --> 04:08.210
I was able to trade
for time served.

04:08.410 --> 04:09.780
I helped
put him away.

04:09.970 --> 04:10.950
You have got to be kidding me.

04:11.150 --> 04:12.870
Todd...No, don't-don't
you touch me.

04:13.060 --> 04:14.070
Please.

04:15.380 --> 04:16.350
You can't be seen here,

04:16.550 --> 04:17.700
and I can't be seen with you.

04:17.900 --> 04:18.700
This... Okay, you know what?

04:18.900 --> 04:19.700
We got to get you out of here.

04:19.900 --> 04:21.480
Don't.

04:21.680 --> 04:22.880
Todd, this
is serious.

04:23.070 --> 04:24.090
No, this is serious.

04:24.290 --> 04:25.230
If my mother sees you,
she would kill me.

04:25.430 --> 04:26.750
Get down. Okay.

04:26.950 --> 04:28.840
Why do you have to be
wearing zebra print?

04:29.040 --> 04:30.540
Uh, not there. Come on.

04:30.730 --> 04:32.970
Todd...No, not in
the conference room.

04:33.170 --> 04:34.890
God, why does this entire place
have to be made of glass?

04:35.090 --> 04:36.010
Oh, here...

04:40.190 --> 04:41.500
Todd...
[exhales]

04:41.700 --> 04:43.160
someone is trying to kill me.

04:43.360 --> 04:45.770
Good. I mean, no,
that's-that's awful.

04:45.970 --> 04:48.020
I'm-I'm sorry,
but that's not my problem.

04:50.940 --> 04:52.250
Hey...

04:52.450 --> 04:54.040
when did you get
all these tattoos?

04:54.240 --> 04:55.860
You don't care if I die?

04:56.060 --> 04:57.340
Look, you tried
to put me in jail,

04:57.540 --> 04:58.740
and then you went instead,

04:58.940 --> 05:00.520
and now, somehow,
you lied your way out, and...

05:00.720 --> 05:03.180
And now the Miller Brothers
are trying to kill me.

05:03.380 --> 05:05.040
Well...[footsteps approaching]

05:06.650 --> 05:08.300
[shushing]

05:22.400 --> 05:23.460
Wait,

05:23.660 --> 05:25.240
who did this to you?

05:25.440 --> 05:26.850
The Millers?

05:27.050 --> 05:28.030
It doesn't--
It doesn't matter...No, no, no.

05:28.230 --> 05:29.680
Why did you come here?

05:29.880 --> 05:31.290
What do you
want from me?

05:31.490 --> 05:32.900
Hmm.

05:33.100 --> 05:34.990
Life on the outside

05:35.190 --> 05:37.910
is a lot harder
than I imagined.

05:38.110 --> 05:41.340
Old enemies, old problems.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.830
So I am...

05:45.030 --> 05:46.340
going away.

05:48.390 --> 05:49.610
This is my boarding pass

05:49.810 --> 05:51.830
for a one-way ticket
to Rio tonight.

05:52.030 --> 05:54.780
8:00 p.m. You'll never
have to see me again.

05:55.830 --> 05:57.530
Okay.
But...

05:59.090 --> 06:00.190
I need money.

06:00.390 --> 06:01.320
What?

06:01.520 --> 06:03.930
I don't have any money
because of you.

06:04.130 --> 06:05.020
I'm not just gonna give you m...

06:05.220 --> 06:06.890
I hid a box of cash.

06:07.090 --> 06:09.590
Large bills, enough
to live on for years.

06:09.790 --> 06:11.200
The Millers think
I stole it from them,

06:11.400 --> 06:12.330
that's why
they're trying to kill me,

06:12.530 --> 06:13.990
but I didn't. It is mine.

06:14.190 --> 06:15.940
But I can't go to the location

06:16.140 --> 06:17.420
'cause they're watching it.

06:17.620 --> 06:18.900
The Millers are the most
dangerous criminals

06:19.100 --> 06:20.250
in the entire Pacific Northwest.Mm-hmm.

06:20.450 --> 06:23.340
Yes, and they have no idea
what you look like.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.870
I mean, you never
actually met them, right?

06:26.070 --> 06:28.390
So, you could go,
get my money,

06:28.590 --> 06:30.350
and then I'm gone.

06:30.550 --> 06:32.220
Todd,

06:32.420 --> 06:35.270
Flight 277 to Rio.
Tonight.

06:35.470 --> 06:38.140
This is my life
we're talking about.

06:38.340 --> 06:39.400
Why do I have to get it?

06:39.600 --> 06:41.450
Why can't you just
use someone else?

06:41.650 --> 06:43.230
I mean, why me?Because...

06:43.430 --> 06:45.100
the money is hidden

06:45.300 --> 06:47.930
in the heating duct
of our old office.

06:48.130 --> 06:49.710
On Klickitat Street.

06:51.190 --> 06:52.290
Todd...

06:52.490 --> 06:54.760
they will kill me.

07:02.850 --> 07:04.770
[sighs]

07:19.430 --> 07:21.650
[sighs]

07:32.010 --> 07:33.580
[vent clatters]

07:40.370 --> 07:41.540
Hey, what are you...

07:42.810 --> 07:43.850
Hey!

07:48.680 --> 07:49.940
[door closes]

07:55.690 --> 07:57.000
[watch beeps]On the case,

07:57.200 --> 07:58.480
or on a case.

07:58.680 --> 08:01.490
Money was gone,
but I don't think she took it.

08:01.680 --> 08:03.660
"She" being the woman
in our old office.

08:03.860 --> 08:04.840
Does she work
for the Millers?

08:05.040 --> 08:06.320
Is she a Miller?

08:06.520 --> 08:07.930
Maybe she's just a random

08:08.130 --> 08:09.320
clever thief.

08:09.520 --> 08:11.270
Either way, she's very elusive.

08:17.840 --> 08:20.360
[phone ringing][hisses, sighs]

08:21.540 --> 08:23.550
Mom, I can't talk right now.

08:23.750 --> 08:25.730
MARGARET:
Just tell me what you've found.

08:25.930 --> 08:27.160
She's not cheating?
He's a monster?

08:27.360 --> 08:29.030
Uh, wait a minute.
Who are "she" and "he?"

08:29.230 --> 08:31.040
Todd, I asked you...

08:31.240 --> 08:33.340
Right, right, right. Mom,
it's barely been an hour, okay?

08:33.540 --> 08:35.520
Gimme a sec. Geez.

08:35.720 --> 08:37.170
I don't have a "sec," Todd.

08:37.370 --> 08:39.250
Did you not understand
how important this is?

08:40.380 --> 08:42.560
I need dirt and info now.

08:44.520 --> 08:45.490
Password?

08:45.690 --> 08:46.830
No starch.

08:47.030 --> 08:48.130
Todd?

08:53.010 --> 08:54.490
Hey.

08:54.690 --> 08:55.880
No starch.

08:56.920 --> 08:57.850
[racing announcer
chatters indistinctly]

08:58.050 --> 08:58.850
MAN:
Hey, put 20on Dixon

08:59.050 --> 08:59.980
in the next
race for me.

09:00.180 --> 09:01.270
What the hell?

09:02.410 --> 09:03.890
Hey!

09:05.890 --> 09:07.550
Police! Don't move,
don't move!

09:07.750 --> 09:09.070
Everybody, hands up.

09:09.270 --> 09:10.950
You're all under arrest
for illegal gambling.

09:11.150 --> 09:12.380
MARGARET:
Todd? What is happening?

09:12.580 --> 09:13.560
Todd, this is your mother.

09:13.760 --> 09:14.560
I demand you tell me what is...

09:14.760 --> 09:16.040
Hi, Todd's Mom.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.390
He's gonna need this phone
to call his lawyer.

09:18.590 --> 09:20.290
That was my lawyer.

09:21.430 --> 09:23.430
♪

09:32.040 --> 09:33.660
Arrested. For illegal gambling?

09:33.860 --> 09:35.060
I wasn't, I...

09:35.260 --> 09:37.150
Mom. I was just
following this woman...

09:37.350 --> 09:38.150
What woman?

09:38.350 --> 09:39.760
I don't know.

09:39.960 --> 09:42.060
I don't know who she is, but
I was looking for something...

09:42.260 --> 09:43.720
Looking for what?
Where?

09:43.920 --> 09:46.410
In an office. On...

09:47.580 --> 09:49.280
On Klickitat Street.

09:50.800 --> 09:53.420
Tell me this is not
about Veronica.

09:53.620 --> 09:55.150
No, no, no, it's not.
It is not about her.

09:56.810 --> 09:59.040
It's about her money.
But she's not...[groans] Good Lord, Todd.

09:59.240 --> 10:00.820
No, she's going away.

10:01.020 --> 10:02.910
Mom, she's moving to Brazil.

10:03.110 --> 10:04.610
She-she-she got
out of jail...

10:04.810 --> 10:08.480
What? [laughs]
Wonderful.

10:08.680 --> 10:10.090
And she came
straight after you.

10:10.290 --> 10:11.790
No, she just asked
me to pick up...
Okay.

10:11.990 --> 10:13.570
I don't want to hear it.
Are you listening to yourself?

10:13.770 --> 10:16.790
You are falling again
for some stupid ploy

10:16.990 --> 10:18.320
from some hideous
snake woman...

10:18.520 --> 10:19.410
Thank you so
much, Jill.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.580
...whose primary
goal in life

10:21.780 --> 10:22.800
is to destroy you.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.450
Someone is trying
to kill her,

10:24.650 --> 10:25.630
and I only agreed...

10:25.830 --> 10:27.500
To be an idiot
and a fool.

10:27.700 --> 10:29.070
That is unkind.

10:29.270 --> 10:31.290
But "snake woman"
is probably fair.

10:31.490 --> 10:33.850
You are aware of the conditions

10:34.050 --> 10:35.460
of the deal I made
two years ago?

10:35.660 --> 10:36.770
Yes.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.860
To keep you
out of jail?

10:39.060 --> 10:43.040
That you not
get into trouble again.

10:43.240 --> 10:45.950
And if you are convicted
of a felony,

10:46.150 --> 10:48.130
all charges are
right back on the table.

10:48.330 --> 10:50.040
Look, I will fix this.

10:50.240 --> 10:51.520
Oh, no, no,
no, no, no.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.220
I'll handle it now.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.350
You have dumped
the mess of your life

10:55.550 --> 10:56.620
right back into my hands.

10:56.820 --> 10:58.180
Because no matter

10:58.380 --> 10:59.920
how much progress
you've made,

11:00.120 --> 11:03.280
you short-circuit every
time Veronica appears.

11:03.470 --> 11:04.540
And for crying
in the night,

11:04.740 --> 11:06.450
I have to go back in there
and beg the D.A.

11:06.650 --> 11:08.450
to drop your new
misdemeanor charge.

11:08.650 --> 11:10.020
Thank God
it's not a felony.

11:10.220 --> 11:12.280
Uh, no, no, no. No, no.
You sit here

11:12.480 --> 11:14.370
and don't go anywhere.

11:14.570 --> 11:16.760
Sit. And stay.

11:18.410 --> 11:20.510
Todd... [chuckles]

11:20.710 --> 11:23.210
...did you even do
a shred of investigating

11:23.410 --> 11:24.640
on Dominic and Dixie
like I asked you to?

11:24.840 --> 11:26.820
I was about to...

11:27.020 --> 11:30.120
Thank you. I can't keep
the D.A. waiting any longer.

11:33.120 --> 11:34.390
He was tailing a criminal,

11:34.590 --> 11:35.870
and he simply walked into...

11:36.070 --> 11:37.400
An illegal
gambling operation.

11:37.600 --> 11:39.010
After an assailant.

11:39.210 --> 11:40.880
So, I'm gonna need
the name of that person.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.660
I don't have it.

11:42.860 --> 11:44.530
The name of the case
you're working on.

11:44.730 --> 11:46.320
Well, i-it's not a case

11:46.520 --> 11:47.710
yet. Um...

11:47.910 --> 11:50.930
He was led astray
by a convicted felon.

11:51.130 --> 11:53.530
He got involved with
Veronica Caron again?

11:54.800 --> 11:57.850
Five minutes after
she was released?

11:58.050 --> 11:59.680
It is not what it sounds like.

11:59.880 --> 12:01.540
Ah, it sounds like
two years ago.

12:02.930 --> 12:04.680
People make mistakes.

12:04.880 --> 12:07.820
Listen, we've known each other
for a long time, Deanna.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.380
Yeah, and you traded on that

12:09.580 --> 12:11.650
back when I was
happy to help, Mags,

12:11.850 --> 12:14.780
but this is what we call
a pattern of behavior,

12:14.980 --> 12:18.440
and I-I... I thought he wanted
his PI license restored.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.700
He does.

12:20.900 --> 12:22.480
Please, can you just...

12:22.680 --> 12:23.490
No.

12:23.690 --> 12:25.520
I'm sorry.

12:27.610 --> 12:29.570
Get your kid in order.

12:31.090 --> 12:33.320
I thought I had.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.180
All right, Todd.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.330
SUSAN:
Margaret. Hey.

12:38.530 --> 12:40.150
Hi. I just ran into Todd.

12:40.350 --> 12:43.060
He gave me your bags,
your coat and this note.

12:50.810 --> 12:51.990
Everything all right?

12:52.190 --> 12:53.910
It's a good thing
you dumped him when you did.

12:54.110 --> 12:55.470
He's a child,

12:55.670 --> 12:57.350
a mess, and he always will be.

12:57.550 --> 12:59.130
Peter is much
better for you.

12:59.330 --> 13:02.610
He's a man who will
never misbehave,

13:02.810 --> 13:05.270
never turn your
life upside down,

13:05.470 --> 13:06.910
and never surprise you.

13:12.350 --> 13:13.880
Surprise.

13:14.080 --> 13:16.020
This is so nice
of Margaret.

13:16.220 --> 13:17.500
Dixie will really
appreciate it.

13:17.700 --> 13:19.630
She's counting on your
mom to save her butt.

13:19.830 --> 13:21.670
Ah, that's my mom.
Big butt-saver.

13:21.870 --> 13:23.550
That's a lot
caffeine, huh?

13:23.750 --> 13:24.980
You must work
a lot of late nights.

13:25.180 --> 13:27.510
Oh, and we get up early.
Vendors in Tokyo,

13:27.710 --> 13:28.810
manufacturing in Beijing.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.290
It's non-stop around the clock.

13:30.490 --> 13:33.030
Gosh, how do you
keep track of it all?

13:33.230 --> 13:34.470
I can barely keep my
mom's schedule straight

13:34.670 --> 13:35.950
in one time zone.

13:36.150 --> 13:38.430
Oh, yeah. We have a good,
uh, tracking software thing.

13:38.630 --> 13:40.780
You know, with call log apps
on Dixie's phones.

13:40.980 --> 13:44.220
Phones? Like phones, plural?

13:44.420 --> 13:46.090
Uh-huh.

13:46.290 --> 13:48.750
One, uh, business,
one "personal."

13:48.940 --> 13:50.790
Anyway, it's
not so bad.

13:50.990 --> 13:52.360
It's all synchronized.
You get used to it.

13:52.560 --> 13:54.230
Hmm. I bet you do.

13:54.430 --> 13:57.410
Mom, got some dirt.
Maybe not what you wanted,

13:57.610 --> 13:59.230
but your client, Dixie,
has two phones,

13:59.430 --> 14:01.880
so I highly suggest you get
records for both of them.

14:07.450 --> 14:08.580
[watch beeps]

14:11.890 --> 14:13.500
Hello?

14:24.640 --> 14:26.740
How are you? Uh, no starch.

14:26.940 --> 14:28.220
No?

14:28.420 --> 14:30.740
Oh, uh, all right. Uh...

14:30.940 --> 14:33.140
Maple bacon.
Chocolate frosted.

14:33.340 --> 14:34.880
Old fashioned.
Pink with sprinkles.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.320
Do I look like
I serve doughnuts?

14:37.510 --> 14:38.800
Uh, cruller.
Jelly filled. Bear claw.

14:38.990 --> 14:40.140
Can I help you, sir?

14:40.340 --> 14:41.230
Yeah, I'm just trying
to guess the password.

14:41.430 --> 14:42.760
To the bathrooms?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.710
Do bathrooms
need a bouncer?

14:44.910 --> 14:45.710
Do I look like a bouncer?

14:45.910 --> 14:46.850
Do I look like an idiot?

14:47.050 --> 14:48.930
Do you want me
to answer that?

14:49.970 --> 14:51.370
Uh, no. Look...

14:51.570 --> 14:53.160
That's not a
bathroom back there.

14:53.360 --> 14:54.990
Okay.

14:55.180 --> 14:56.380
I just... There's
gambling back there,

14:56.580 --> 14:57.550
and I need to
speak to the woman

14:57.750 --> 14:58.550
who I suspect
just went inside.

14:58.750 --> 14:59.900
Then I guess you
need a password.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.170
But you just...

15:01.360 --> 15:03.300
Okay, uh, glazed.

15:03.500 --> 15:05.910
Uh, unglazed.
Strawberry... surprise?

15:06.110 --> 15:07.520
Banana cream.
Banana non-cream.

15:07.720 --> 15:08.870
Maple twist.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.220
Is it doughnut-related?

15:10.420 --> 15:11.780
Order for Veronica.

15:14.600 --> 15:15.880
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

15:16.080 --> 15:17.300
Hey!

15:29.360 --> 15:31.200
TODD:
<i>Mom, it's a setup.</i>

15:31.390 --> 15:32.590
The whole thing.

15:32.790 --> 15:34.420
The-the doughnuts,
the black eye,

15:34.620 --> 15:36.900
the dry-cleaning.
She-she-she wants revenge.

15:37.100 --> 15:39.070
I mean, she got me arrested
for illegal gambling,

15:39.270 --> 15:40.810
and now she's got me
on camera

15:41.010 --> 15:41.810
with a big box
of cash

15:42.010 --> 15:43.560
like I'm laundering money

15:43.750 --> 15:44.900
for the illegal gambling,

15:45.100 --> 15:46.470
which bumps me up
to a felony,

15:46.670 --> 15:47.910
and then all my charges

15:48.110 --> 15:50.600
are back on the table
and I'm off to the slammer.

15:51.730 --> 15:52.990
Mom?

15:54.820 --> 15:56.090
Mom, what's going on?

15:56.290 --> 16:00.790
Beverly Crest took me off
the Dixie Kimble divorce.

16:00.990 --> 16:05.100
I am in Siberia now,

16:05.300 --> 16:07.960
and it's all your fault.

16:13.710 --> 16:15.150
Mom, got some dirt.
Maybe not what you wanted,

16:15.350 --> 16:16.590
but your client, Dixie,
has two phones,

16:16.790 --> 16:18.160
and I highly suggest
you get the records

16:18.350 --> 16:19.160
for both of them.

16:19.360 --> 16:20.810
You played that
aloud in the room?

16:21.010 --> 16:22.940
How was I supposed to know
what you were going to say?

16:23.140 --> 16:25.030
How was I supposed to know
you were with your client?

16:25.230 --> 16:27.820
Todd, Dixie Kimble tried
to fire me on the spot.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.250
It looked like we were
investigating her.

16:29.450 --> 16:30.600
I was try...Huh? No.

16:30.800 --> 16:31.950
She would have walked out

16:32.150 --> 16:33.340
with her $70 million
worth of business

16:33.540 --> 16:35.130
if-if Beverly hadn't taken
the case away from me.

16:35.330 --> 16:37.260
Did you miss the part
where I just said

16:37.460 --> 16:39.610
that Veronica is setting me up
to go to jail?

16:39.810 --> 16:40.830
That is where
you deserve to go

16:41.030 --> 16:42.050
if you continue to get involved

16:42.250 --> 16:43.400
with this monster woman.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.790
Which is it,
monster woman or snake lady?

16:44.990 --> 16:46.100
Pick one, Mom.Todd,

16:46.300 --> 16:47.450
I have been trying

16:47.640 --> 16:49.930
to make named partner for years.I...

16:50.130 --> 16:51.620
This is a very
important client to me,

16:51.820 --> 16:52.800
and now I am ruined.

16:53.000 --> 16:54.370
You're not ruined.Yes, I am.

16:54.560 --> 16:55.980
Ruined? Really?Yes. Yes, I am.

16:56.180 --> 16:57.320
You're wearing
an $800 belt

16:57.520 --> 16:58.720
and green shoes.
Oh.

16:58.920 --> 16:59.980
How do you know how
much my belt cost?

17:00.180 --> 17:01.980
And these shoes
are pistachio.

17:02.180 --> 17:03.640
You know, you're gonna have
plenty of other clients, Mom.

17:03.830 --> 17:06.370
Meanwhile, I am being framed
and sent up the river.

17:12.900 --> 17:13.990
I will have you know

17:14.190 --> 17:16.130
that the prison
that you would be sent to

17:16.330 --> 17:17.690
is downriver...

17:17.890 --> 17:19.000
Oh, it's a figure
of speech, Mom.

17:19.200 --> 17:21.220
...and I am not going
to let that happen.

17:21.420 --> 17:23.910
Wait, you're not going
to let that happen?

17:25.470 --> 17:27.270
No, of course not.

17:27.470 --> 17:28.560
You're my son.

17:31.390 --> 17:34.610
Why does Veronica have
such a hold on you?

17:36.180 --> 17:37.750
I don't know.

17:39.530 --> 17:41.590
She was exciting.

17:41.790 --> 17:44.070
I mean, we did all of these

17:44.270 --> 17:45.980
risky and dangerous
things together,

17:46.180 --> 17:49.330
and it was like...
this big adventure.

17:49.530 --> 17:52.760
And even if it did
end badly, it's...

17:54.200 --> 17:56.120
...it was really good.

17:56.320 --> 17:58.390
Most of the time.

17:58.590 --> 18:00.640
It was. It was really good.

18:01.860 --> 18:04.040
You know, that's how
I feel about Harry.

18:04.240 --> 18:06.310
The bad ending

18:06.510 --> 18:08.820
doesn't negate the good times.

18:12.390 --> 18:14.050
I did love him.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.000
Once.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.960
I'm going to jail, aren't I?

18:20.010 --> 18:21.490
No.

18:23.710 --> 18:27.200
She could have had you arrested
at that doughnut shop

18:27.400 --> 18:29.070
and you'd be up on
felony charges already

18:29.270 --> 18:31.850
and gone tomorrow,
which makes me think...

18:32.050 --> 18:33.380
There's a bigger plan.

18:33.580 --> 18:34.810
Yes, but what is it?

18:35.010 --> 18:36.160
You know, if only
I could find that woman

18:36.360 --> 18:37.290
and get her to talk...

18:37.490 --> 18:39.690
Todd, do you hear yourself?

18:39.890 --> 18:41.170
No, I'm just...No, no.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.730
Right back into
the jaws of danger.

18:42.930 --> 18:44.080

Yes, you did. When you first
started working with Veronica,

you signed an NDA

read those forms

still has that agreement,

28:31.620 --> 28:32.760
I'm so sorry
about this, Margaret.

28:32.960 --> 28:34.150
Oh, no, no, no.
You're just doing your job.

28:34.350 --> 28:35.890
I still can't believe
you got arrested.

28:36.090 --> 28:37.330
You and me both.

28:37.530 --> 28:39.290
Oh, it's the craziest story.

28:39.490 --> 28:40.720
The next time I see you, I'll...

28:40.920 --> 28:43.070
[gasps] Dolly.

28:43.270 --> 28:45.210
Is that a ring?
Did he finally propose?

28:45.410 --> 28:47.510
[giggles] We're
planning a June wedding.

28:47.710 --> 28:50.250
[laughs]:
Oh, wonderful.

28:51.420 --> 28:53.080
I'm actually gonna need to
take your jewelry, too.

28:53.280 --> 28:54.390
Oh, yes, of course.
Of course.

28:54.590 --> 28:55.390
Earrings, too?

28:55.590 --> 28:56.830
Uh, yes, ma'am.
Okay.

28:57.030 --> 28:58.520
Oh, a June bride.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.570
Oh, they're my favorite.
[laughs]

29:00.770 --> 29:01.960
Good?

29:02.160 --> 29:03.180
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Um...

29:03.380 --> 29:05.100
just pat the top down.

29:05.290 --> 29:07.100
Okay.
There.

29:07.300 --> 29:08.840
Beautiful as ever.Okay.

29:09.040 --> 29:09.930
What happened again?

29:10.130 --> 29:11.840
Oh, you'll never believe it.

29:12.040 --> 29:14.270
It is the craziest story.

29:16.790 --> 29:17.800
<i>[Margaret chuckles]</i>

29:18.000 --> 29:20.890
It was a total case
of mistaken identity.

29:21.090 --> 29:23.330
Oh. How many more weeks
do you have?

29:23.530 --> 29:24.550
Four.

29:24.750 --> 29:26.550
Four? Oh, my God.

29:26.750 --> 29:28.120
That last month is the worst.

29:28.320 --> 29:29.990
I mean, the ankles.

29:30.190 --> 29:32.820
Uh, non-aerosol hairspray
takes the ink off fastest.

29:33.020 --> 29:33.950
Or lemon juice.

29:34.150 --> 29:36.910
Thank you. You are the best.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.690
I'm off to
the arraignment.

29:38.890 --> 29:40.480
Let's just hope
I don't get a hanging judge.

29:40.680 --> 29:42.340
[laughs]
And good luck.

29:45.600 --> 29:47.690
I'm so sorry, Mom.

29:48.870 --> 29:50.570
Just get me out of here.

30:13.890 --> 30:15.820
It's late, Susan.Go home.

30:16.020 --> 30:17.160
[soft chuckle]

30:27.040 --> 30:28.270
Margaret?

30:28.460 --> 30:29.790
Hey.
Hi.

30:29.990 --> 30:31.490
I came back to get
the Koenig motion.

30:31.690 --> 30:32.570
What are you doing?

30:32.770 --> 30:35.050
[sighs] Isn't that the question?

30:35.250 --> 30:36.840
What am I doing?

30:37.040 --> 30:39.410
I mean, I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep,

30:39.610 --> 30:41.790
and it felt better
just to be working.

30:44.190 --> 30:45.760
Am I a terrible mother?

30:45.960 --> 30:46.760
What?

30:46.960 --> 30:49.460
[sighs] No.

30:49.660 --> 30:50.980
No, you're not.

30:51.180 --> 30:52.120
When your child

30:52.310 --> 30:53.810
makes a mistake,
they're supposed to

30:54.010 --> 30:55.770
learn a lesson. Right?

30:55.970 --> 30:59.170
When Todd got in
trouble two years ago,

30:59.370 --> 31:01.300
I... I rescued him,

31:01.500 --> 31:03.600
but I asked him to pay me back.

31:03.800 --> 31:04.950
A-And shouldn't I have?

31:05.150 --> 31:06.690
Otherwise, how
will he learn?

31:06.890 --> 31:08.610
How much money does
he still owe you?

31:08.810 --> 31:10.470
Oh, around $6,000.

31:11.910 --> 31:12.830
No, I don't really care
about that,

31:13.030 --> 31:14.660
but I want him to understand

31:14.860 --> 31:17.750
that there are consequences
to our actions.

31:17.950 --> 31:19.320
That we have to be accountable.

31:19.520 --> 31:20.880
Uh-huh.

31:21.080 --> 31:23.580
Or maybe you're just worried
that once he's paid you back,

31:23.780 --> 31:25.320
once he's free and clear,

31:25.520 --> 31:27.060
you'll lose your hold on him

31:27.260 --> 31:29.060
and he'll leave.

31:32.670 --> 31:34.330
Well, I mean...

31:34.530 --> 31:36.460
maybe that's part of it.

31:36.660 --> 31:38.760
But not all of it.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.600
I will get the rubbing alcohol
from the break room.

31:42.800 --> 31:44.650
No, no, no.
I-I'll get it.

31:44.850 --> 31:45.860
It'll get the ink off.

31:46.060 --> 31:47.730
No, no, it's late.

31:48.770 --> 31:49.900
[sighs]

31:54.300 --> 31:55.960
Oh.Dixie.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.700
Margaret. Hello.

31:57.900 --> 31:59.050
I, uh...

31:59.250 --> 32:01.310
Beverly and I are working late.

32:02.310 --> 32:04.620
As am I.
[chuckles]

32:04.820 --> 32:06.930
Um...

32:07.130 --> 32:08.890
Dixie, I owe you an apology.

32:09.090 --> 32:11.970
For inadvertently
revealing your indiscretion.

32:13.230 --> 32:15.720
No, it's my fault.

32:15.920 --> 32:17.160
I'm the one
who lied,

32:17.360 --> 32:19.200
and actually did
the indiscretion.

32:19.400 --> 32:20.810
I screwed everything up.

32:21.010 --> 32:22.680
Well, you're human.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.250
You made a mistake. A big one.

32:25.450 --> 32:26.990
But you'll be okay.

32:27.190 --> 32:29.690
Beverly will
work everything out.

32:29.890 --> 32:32.130
You're a lot different from her.

32:32.330 --> 32:33.350
Softer.

32:33.550 --> 32:35.080
More human.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.440
I'm just sick

32:37.640 --> 32:38.920
that I'm about to lose

32:39.120 --> 32:40.610
half of everything I've built

32:40.810 --> 32:41.780
because I was an idiot.

32:44.090 --> 32:46.010
I know you're not
my attorney anymore, but...

32:46.210 --> 32:48.930
Oh, no, no, no,
I-I cannot advise you.

32:49.130 --> 32:51.100
Just woman to woman, then.

32:51.300 --> 32:53.440
What do you think I should do?

32:55.450 --> 32:58.020
Well, I think

32:58.220 --> 33:00.330
that you and Dominic
probably loved each other

33:00.530 --> 33:02.640
very much
at one time,

33:02.840 --> 33:04.160
and that even though
mistakes were made,

33:04.360 --> 33:07.500
you can still go to him
and tell him the truth.

33:08.850 --> 33:11.080
About what
happened,

33:11.280 --> 33:13.210
and why it
happened.

33:13.410 --> 33:15.690
It won't fix everything,

33:15.890 --> 33:17.960
but coming clean
will go a long way

33:18.160 --> 33:20.080
toward you feeling better
about yourself.

33:21.690 --> 33:24.960
A full confession
is truly the only way

33:25.160 --> 33:29.320
to release the power
anyone has over you.

33:29.520 --> 33:31.620
Why are your fingertips black?

33:31.820 --> 33:33.490
Oh, uh, I'm an ex-con. Ha!

33:33.690 --> 33:34.710
[chuckling]:
Oh, no.

33:34.910 --> 33:36.890
Excuse me,
I really do have to go. Uh...

33:37.090 --> 33:38.150
Good luck.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.630
Um, it was a pleasure
representing you,

33:40.830 --> 33:42.670
however briefly.

33:43.840 --> 33:45.290
[phone chimes]Text Todd.

33:45.490 --> 33:46.720
Todd, period.

33:46.920 --> 33:48.030
I know how we're going
to get you out

33:48.230 --> 33:49.810
from under Veronica, period.
Call me, period.

33:50.010 --> 33:51.110
Immediately, exclamation point.

33:56.770 --> 33:58.170
Your Honor,
my client Todd Wright

33:58.370 --> 34:00.860
is here today to confess
his criminal behavior.

34:03.430 --> 34:06.780
In 2018, I signed an agreement
without reading it.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.790
That document, along with
my personal information

34:10.990 --> 34:12.490
that I willingly gave,

34:12.690 --> 34:15.710
was used in setting up an
illegal gambling organization.

34:15.910 --> 34:18.670
I visited
one of their locations,

34:18.870 --> 34:21.620
and I had my hands
on some of their money.

34:22.750 --> 34:25.010
Uh, I did all of this
of my own volition.

34:26.450 --> 34:28.900
Mr. Wright's actions
have brought about

34:29.100 --> 34:30.720
a misdemeanor charge,
and we are here today

34:30.920 --> 34:32.290
to get ahead of
the felony charge

34:32.490 --> 34:33.900
which will
likely follow.

34:34.100 --> 34:36.510
TODD:
And I am deeply

34:36.710 --> 34:40.910
ashamed and embarrassed

34:41.110 --> 34:43.380
at getting caught up
in this criminal enterprise.

34:47.170 --> 34:50.090
And we hope that you may show
some mercy in his sentencing.

34:50.290 --> 34:51.750
JUDGE:
Thank you, Mr. Wright.

34:51.950 --> 34:53.270
I'll review
the file

34:53.470 --> 34:56.490
and hold the sentencing
hearing after lunch.

34:56.690 --> 34:58.490
At that time, the prosecution

34:58.690 --> 35:00.750
can put forward
any witnesses,

35:00.950 --> 35:02.970
and Mr. Wright
can offer mitigation.

35:03.170 --> 35:04.370
Recess.

35:04.570 --> 35:06.450
Thank you, Your Honor.

35:12.890 --> 35:13.990
Of course you're here.

35:14.190 --> 35:16.640
Oh, D.A. Corrigan
called me personally.

35:16.840 --> 35:18.640
I'm testifying against you.

35:18.840 --> 35:20.770
And I promised to do the same
for Mommy Dearest.

35:20.970 --> 35:22.780
Well, it doesn't matter.

35:22.980 --> 35:24.770
I've made peace with
everything that's happened.

35:26.120 --> 35:27.170
And I'm done with you.

35:27.370 --> 35:28.340
Come on, sweetheart,
let's not talk to her.

35:33.080 --> 35:35.090
Won't be so easy this time, huh?

35:35.290 --> 35:38.750
Protecting your son,
once you've been disbarred?

35:38.950 --> 35:41.230
Oh, yes, that was your endgame
all along, wasn't it?

35:41.430 --> 35:42.840
Mmm. You're the reason
I was in jail.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.800
You defended him and gave
the D.A. every scrap of evidence

35:46.000 --> 35:47.370
to put me away
in the first place.

35:47.570 --> 35:49.110
I spent two

35:49.310 --> 35:52.330
long years in that hellhole

35:52.530 --> 35:55.510
dreaming of this moment.
[laughs]

35:55.700 --> 35:57.250
Well, I have to hand it to you.

35:57.450 --> 35:59.860
Luring Todd into that
illegal gambling site,

36:00.060 --> 36:01.340
knowing that I would
come to his rescue

36:01.540 --> 36:02.950
as soon as he was in jeopardy.

36:03.150 --> 36:04.600
You're good.

36:04.800 --> 36:06.730
Smart.

36:06.930 --> 36:09.610
Tell me, how did you do it?

36:09.810 --> 36:11.130
Mmm, thank you.

36:11.330 --> 36:13.520
I'm smart enough to know
that you're wearing

36:13.720 --> 36:15.000
the earrings from poker night

36:15.200 --> 36:16.960
which have
cameras in them,

36:17.160 --> 36:18.530
and a mic.

36:18.730 --> 36:20.660
Who do you think
trained your little boy

36:20.860 --> 36:22.650
to get a solid confession?

36:23.870 --> 36:25.350
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

36:26.530 --> 36:28.890
Ah, there we go.[groans]

36:29.090 --> 36:30.110
I'm not saying another word

36:30.300 --> 36:31.110
until you hand over
the earrings,

36:31.310 --> 36:32.920
the mic, and your phones.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.460
Okay?

36:35.660 --> 36:38.160
Thank you. Todd?
What?

36:38.360 --> 36:41.120
The burner phone recording
in your back pocket. Come on.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.810
Thank you.

36:43.010 --> 36:44.460
[sighs]

36:46.110 --> 36:48.120
Mm, let's see.

36:48.320 --> 36:50.910
I will always

36:51.110 --> 36:53.740
be one step ahead of you.

36:53.940 --> 36:55.510
Always.

36:59.040 --> 37:01.830
So, that agreement
that you had him sign?

37:02.030 --> 37:04.310
Oh, yeah, standard
boilerplate for suckers.

37:04.510 --> 37:07.360
I just got his okay
to ensnare him

37:07.560 --> 37:09.490
in any criminal
enterprise I chose.

37:09.690 --> 37:12.060
Gambling just felt
the most poetic.

37:12.260 --> 37:14.630
And what about Lindy?

37:14.830 --> 37:17.460
Oh, my God, you do love
a helpless woman.

37:17.660 --> 37:19.150
She was paying off
a favor to me,

37:19.350 --> 37:20.420
luring you into trouble,

37:20.620 --> 37:22.200
knowing full well this one

37:22.400 --> 37:24.070
would comerunning.

37:24.270 --> 37:25.640
You are both
just so easy.

37:25.840 --> 37:27.160
[laughs]
I orchestrated

37:27.360 --> 37:29.210
every part of this,

37:29.410 --> 37:31.290
every step of the way.

37:32.510 --> 37:36.250
Speaking of orchestrating
every step of the way...

37:37.640 --> 37:38.990
You missed a few
recording devices.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.000
Thanks, Lyle.
These earrings are cool.

37:43.200 --> 37:45.130
I think I got every word.

37:47.610 --> 37:49.710
I haven't been on
the bench in eight years,

37:49.910 --> 37:51.580
and that was fun.

37:51.780 --> 37:53.230
[chuckles]

37:53.430 --> 37:57.540
Veronica, meet my friend,
retired Judge Myles Friedman.

37:57.740 --> 37:59.240
And that entire

37:59.440 --> 38:01.500
confession
in there? Fake.

38:01.700 --> 38:04.020
Sorry, but smile,
you're on camera.

38:04.220 --> 38:05.810
Mm, okay.

38:06.010 --> 38:07.850
Now that we have
your confession

38:08.050 --> 38:09.510
on audio and video...

38:09.710 --> 38:10.990
We're taking
the appropriate steps

38:11.190 --> 38:12.560
to put you back
behind bars again.

38:12.750 --> 38:14.770
When we make
deals with felons,

38:14.970 --> 38:15.860
one of the
conditions is

38:16.060 --> 38:17.260
not to break the law again.

38:17.460 --> 38:20.650
And especially not
within weeks of your release.

38:20.850 --> 38:23.040
Okay, this is...
This is ridiculous.

38:23.240 --> 38:25.390
You can't do this.
You set me up.

38:25.590 --> 38:28.220
And quite well, I might add.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.620
[laughs]

38:29.820 --> 38:31.230
We did it![laughter]

38:31.430 --> 38:32.310
Thank you, everyone, for all...

38:32.510 --> 38:34.270
Whoa! Okay.

38:34.470 --> 38:36.360
Oh-ho-ho, that was fun.

38:36.560 --> 38:37.970
Yeah, Veronica's
not the only one

38:38.170 --> 38:39.760
who knows how to set up
an elaborate sting.

38:39.960 --> 38:41.850
Yes, I think we pulled that off.

38:42.040 --> 38:43.280
Mm-hmm.
Now, Todd,

38:43.480 --> 38:45.500
I'd like to talk to you
about something.

38:45.700 --> 38:47.500
Okay.

38:47.700 --> 38:49.810
This debt,
the money you owe me...

38:50.010 --> 38:51.460
I know, I know.
I'm gonna repay it.

38:51.660 --> 38:52.600
We could just
take a larger chunk

38:52.790 --> 38:54.160
out of my paycheck
every week.

38:54.360 --> 38:56.380
No. I'd like to
take no chunks

38:56.580 --> 38:59.080
out of your paycheck
from now on.

38:59.280 --> 39:00.820
You are right.

39:01.020 --> 39:02.690
You are never
going to get ahead

39:02.890 --> 39:04.610
or get out
of your sister's garage

39:04.810 --> 39:06.570
if you have to keep
tithing to me.

39:06.770 --> 39:08.740
Wait, really?
Are you serious?

39:08.940 --> 39:10.350
Debt cleared?
Wiped away?

39:10.550 --> 39:12.310
Wiped clean.

39:12.510 --> 39:13.400
Starting now.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.620
But I am no longer
paying for lunches.

39:15.820 --> 39:17.580
Not any lunch,
anymore, forever.

39:17.780 --> 39:19.010
What? Not even
your favorite,

39:19.210 --> 39:21.230
the shrimp salad in
the downstairs cafeteria?

39:21.430 --> 39:22.320
Nope, not even that.

39:22.520 --> 39:24.370
In fact...

39:24.570 --> 39:25.980
you are treating me.

39:26.180 --> 39:27.280
Let's go.

39:27.480 --> 39:29.280
Uh, this feels like
another trap.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.890
Oh, it is, it is.

39:31.090 --> 39:33.330
Trapped into a lifetime
of lunches with your mother.

39:33.530 --> 39:36.020
A fate worse
than death.

39:40.940 --> 39:42.160
Mmm.

39:43.550 --> 39:45.200
BEVERLY:
Celebrating
today's triumph?

39:46.640 --> 39:47.560
Mmm.

39:47.760 --> 39:48.960
Yes. [clears throat] Yes.

39:49.160 --> 39:50.170
[chuckles]
Good news travels fast.

39:50.370 --> 39:51.830
I also heard

39:52.030 --> 39:53.130
you spoke
to Dixie Kimble last night.

39:53.330 --> 39:54.920
[coughs] Yes...

39:55.120 --> 39:56.010
[coughs] Yes, I'm sorry.

39:56.210 --> 39:57.400
I ran into her
in the break room,

39:57.600 --> 39:58.970
but I didn't say anything
that would, in any way...

39:59.170 --> 40:00.010
She spoke to Dominic.

40:00.210 --> 40:01.270
Confessed her sins.

40:01.470 --> 40:02.530
And it worked.

40:02.730 --> 40:04.970
The marriage is over,
but he's backed down

40:05.170 --> 40:07.280
and agreed
to a healthy settlement.

40:07.480 --> 40:08.450
And Dixie is interested

40:08.650 --> 40:09.890
in our firm continuing
to represent her.

40:10.090 --> 40:12.240
Oh. Well, that's wonderful news.

40:12.440 --> 40:14.060
With you as lead counsel.

40:19.980 --> 40:21.810
Maybe I was wrong about you.

40:24.290 --> 40:27.820
Maybe I'm just a different
kind of killer.

40:28.020 --> 40:29.810
Hmm.

40:35.690 --> 40:36.960
[whispering]:
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

40:37.160 --> 40:38.210
[exhales sharply]

40:41.390 --> 40:42.620
Indeed.

40:42.820 --> 40:43.920
Mmm.

40:44.120 --> 40:45.750
LYLE:Stealing more
cupcakes?

40:45.950 --> 40:47.410
What? I did not.

40:47.610 --> 40:48.800
Birthday cupcakes
for Bob's birthday

40:49.000 --> 40:50.100
were missing from
this refrigerator.

40:50.300 --> 40:51.890
I know nothing
about that.
And we all know

40:52.090 --> 40:53.500
you have a sweet tooth.And I have audio proof
that I resisted.

40:53.700 --> 40:55.940
You won't get away with
your criminal behavior for long.

40:56.140 --> 40:57.070
What?

40:57.270 --> 40:58.240
Oh, no.

40:58.440 --> 41:01.240
Not... for... long.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.940
Okay, that is spying.
Plus, it's illegal.

41:13.640 --> 41:14.900
And I'm innocent.

41:16.210 --> 41:17.820
I'm innocent.

Huh.

your deal with
