I love that restaurant!
I heard Madonna went into labor there.

03:11.400 --> 03:14.609
Oh, gosh, I have to go shopping.
OK. I'll see you tonight.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.330
OK. Bye!

03:16.600 --> 03:18.762
Bruiser, what's this?

03:22.800 --> 03:25.724
"Good luck tonight.
Elle and Warner forever."

03:25.880 --> 03:27.962
That's so cute.

03:42.520 --> 03:45.808
Oh, my gosh! You guys are so sweet.

03:46.520 --> 03:48.807
But I'm not positive
it's gonna happen tonight.

03:48.960 --> 03:51.531
Hello! He just had lunch
with his grandmother.

03:51.680 --> 03:52.841
You know he got the rock.

03:53.040 --> 03:55.202
Why else would she have
flown in from Newport?

03:55.360 --> 03:57.601
It's not like she'd
FedEx a six-carat diamond.

03:57.760 --> 03:59.000
Do you really think?

03:59.160 --> 04:01.162
I can't believe
you're getting engaged!

04:02.320 --> 04:06.041
Oh, my gosh. You guys have
to help me pick out the perfect outfit.

04:06.200 --> 04:07.486
Come on.

04:08.240 --> 04:11.323
I think you should go with
the red. It's the color of confidence.

04:11.520 --> 04:14.808
I don't understand why you're completely
disregarding your signature color?

04:14.960 --> 04:17.964
He's proposing. I can't look
like I would on any other date.

04:18.120 --> 04:21.567
This is the date.
The night I'll always remember.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.484
I wanna look special.

04:24.640 --> 04:27.689
Bridal. But not like I expect anything.

04:27.840 --> 04:31.561
There's nothing I love more than
a dumb blonde with Daddy's plastic.

04:31.720 --> 04:32.721
You know how he gets excited...

04:32.880 --> 04:35.451
Did you see this one?
We just got it in yesterday.

04:35.600 --> 04:38.683
Oh! Is this low-viscosity rayon?

04:39.440 --> 04:41.363
Yes, of course.

04:41.520 --> 04:43.045
With a half-loop top stitching
on the hem?

04:43.200 --> 04:46.010
Absolutely. it's one of a kind.

04:47.520 --> 04:50.922
It's impossible to use a half-loop
top stitching on low-viscosity rayon.

04:51.080 --> 04:54.243
It would snag the fabric.
And you didn't just get it in.

04:54.400 --> 04:55.890
I saw it in Teen Vogue a year ago.

04:56.040 --> 04:58.441
So if you're trying
to sell it to me for full price,

04:58.600 --> 05:00.170
you picked the wrong girl.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.051
OW.

05:05.240 --> 05:07.641
Girls, this is it.

05:08.720 --> 05:13.044
In a few hours, I'll be the future
Mrs. Warner Huntington III.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.251
Hello.

05:45.280 --> 05:46.770
Wow.

05:46.920 --> 05:48.809
You look so beautiful.

05:48.960 --> 05:50.291
So do you.

06:00.320 --> 06:01.685
Let's get out of here.

06:05.880 --> 06:07.120
OK.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.643
It must be strange
having such perfect eyes.

06:23.040 --> 06:25.850
God, you're so wonderful.
Elle, thank you.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.886
- Here's to us.
- To us.

06:35.880 --> 06:37.769
Mmm!

06:40.080 --> 06:41.969
- Elle...
- Yes.

06:43.000 --> 06:47.005
One of the reasons I wanted to come
here tonight was to discuss our future.

06:47.160 --> 06:50.084
I am fully amenable to that discussion.

06:50.240 --> 06:51.321
Good.

06:51.480 --> 06:53.801
You know how we've been having
all kinds of fun lately?

06:53.960 --> 06:57.328
Yeah.
- Well, Harvard is gonna be different.

06:58.040 --> 07:02.250
Law school is a completely different
world, and I need to be serious.

07:02.440 --> 07:03.726
Of course.

07:04.680 --> 07:06.842
I mean, my family
expects a lot from me.

07:07.480 --> 07:09.289
- Right.
- I expect a lot from me.

07:10.040 --> 07:12.168
I plan on running for office some day.

07:12.320 --> 07:14.322
And I fully support that, Warner.
You know that, right?

07:14.480 --> 07:15.481
Absolutely.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.929
But the thing is, if I'm gonna
be a senator by the time I'm 30,

07:20.120 --> 07:22.168
I need to stop dicking around.

07:22.320 --> 07:26.041
Oh, Warner... I completely agree.

07:27.840 --> 07:30.650
Well, that's why I think
it's time for us...

07:30.840 --> 07:32.365
...Elle...

07:32.520 --> 07:35.046
- ...Pooh Bear...
- Yes?

07:36.720 --> 07:39.041
- I do.
- I think we should break up.

07:42.720 --> 07:43.881
What'?!

07:44.040 --> 07:46.725
I've been thinking about it,
and I think it's the right thing to do.

07:47.320 --> 07:49.163
You're breaking up with me?

07:50.040 --> 07:53.726
- I thought you were proposing.
- Proposing?

07:53.880 --> 07:57.043
Elle! If I'm gonna be a senator,

07:57.240 --> 08:00.687
well, I need to marry a Jackie,
not a Marilyn.

08:00.840 --> 08:04.287
So you're breaking up with me
because I'm too... blonde?

08:04.440 --> 08:06.727
No. That's not entirely true.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.241
Then what? My boobs are too big?

08:11.080 --> 08:12.411
Your boobs are fine.

08:12.560 --> 08:16.201
So when you said you would always love
me, you were just dicking around?

08:16.360 --> 08:18.840
Elle, I... I do love you. I...

08:19.000 --> 08:21.606
...I just can't marry you.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.445
You have no idea the pressure
that I am under.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.602
My family has five
generations of senators.

08:26.760 --> 08:29.206
My brother's
in the top three at Yale Law,

08:29.400 --> 08:32.051
and he just got engaged
to a Vanderbilt, for Christ's sake!

08:44.080 --> 08:45.491
Bad salad.

08:47.000 --> 08:49.765
Sweetie... Pooh Bear?

08:53.000 --> 08:55.606
It's not like I have
a choice here, sweetheart.

08:57.640 --> 09:00.246
OK, you get the car.
I'll get the check.

09:00.400 --> 09:02.243
I won't be having salad.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.768
Come on, let me take you home.

09:11.920 --> 09:12.967
No.

09:13.120 --> 09:15.441
Elle, believe me,
I never expected to do this.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.690
But I think it's the right thing.

09:17.840 --> 09:21.003
How can it be the right thing
when we're not together?

09:21.200 --> 09:24.921
I have to think of my future
and what my family expects of me.

09:25.120 --> 09:28.806
So you're breaking up with me because
you're afraid your family won't like me?

09:29.000 --> 09:32.846
- Everybody likes me.
- Well, East Coast people are different.

09:33.320 --> 09:36.005
Just because I'm not a Vanderbilt,
suddenly I'm white trash?

09:36.160 --> 09:39.164
I grew up in Bel Air, Warner,
across the street from Aaron Spelling.

09:39.320 --> 09:41.448
I think most people
would agree that's a lot better

09:41.640 --> 09:43.563
than some stinky old Vanderbilt.

09:43.720 --> 09:47.167
I told you, I need someone serious.

09:48.680 --> 09:51.001
Well, I'm seriously in love with you.

09:52.040 --> 09:55.806
Isn't that enough?

09:55.960 --> 09:58.691
Pooh Bear, just get in the car.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.844
No.

10:04.200 --> 10:05.770
You're gonna ruin your shoes.

10:11.960 --> 10:13.086
OK.

11:02.040 --> 11:04.088
Morning, Amy.

11:09.480 --> 11:13.530
Elle, it's Amy. I'm having trouble
with this whole lip-liner thing.

11:13.680 --> 11:15.603
Sweetie, didn't you hear?

11:15.760 --> 11:19.162
- Hear what?
- Oh... It's terrible. He dumped her.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.762
Why me?

11:22.920 --> 11:26.129
Because you're not gonna remember
anything after tonight.

11:28.320 --> 11:30.004
Oh, you're wrong.

11:31.240 --> 11:34.005
I will remember; no matter what.

11:35.160 --> 11:37.481
And I’m never gonna lose you again.

11:38.320 --> 11:42.291
You couldn't.
You're a pad of me.

11:44.080 --> 11:45.445
I love you.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.124
Liar!

11:48.440 --> 11:50.807
Honey, you have to leave this room.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.644
It's been, like, a week.

11:53.480 --> 11:56.006
- So?
- Drink this.

11:56.160 --> 12:00.404
What's the one thing that always
makes us feel better, no matter what?

12:03.800 --> 12:06.770
She had eight grilled-cheese sandwiches.

12:06.920 --> 12:10.481
She just stuffed 'em in her mouth,
all at once. It was so sad.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.768
We thought she'd be
the first to walk down the aisle,

12:12.960 --> 12:15.281
and now she's totally adrift.

12:15.920 --> 12:17.001
Totally!

12:18.960 --> 12:20.928
She hasn't conditioned
her hair in a week.

12:21.080 --> 12:23.048
Maybe she's
going for the grunge look.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.521
And, like, her nails
are full-on chipped.

12:25.720 --> 12:26.960
So trailer park.

12:38.680 --> 12:40.330
Oh, my God!

12:40.480 --> 12:42.528
- Do you know who this is?
- No.

12:42.680 --> 12:45.684
- That's Warner's older brother.
- Who?

12:45.840 --> 12:49.049
"Third-year Yale Law student,
Putnam Bowes Huntington III

12:49.240 --> 12:52.562
and his fiancee,
Layne Walker Vanderbilt,

12:52.720 --> 12:55.929
first year, Yale Law."

12:57.000 --> 13:00.607
This is the type of girl
Warner wants to marry.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.371
This is what I need
to become to be serious.

13:03.520 --> 13:06.205
What? Practically deformed?

13:06.360 --> 13:07.566
No!

13:08.640 --> 13:10.404
A law student.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.560
Elle?

13:17.560 --> 13:18.561
Law school?

13:18.720 --> 13:21.041
It's a perfectly
respectable place, Daddy.

13:21.200 --> 13:24.044
Honey, you were first runner-up

13:24.240 --> 13:26.402
at the Miss Hawaiian Tropics contest.

13:26.560 --> 13:28.562
Why are you gonna throw that all away?

13:28.720 --> 13:31.883
Going to Harvard is the only way
I'm gonna get the love of my life back.

13:32.080 --> 13:34.287
Sweetheart, you don't need law school.

13:34.440 --> 13:40.049
Law school's for people
who are boring and ugly and serious.

13:40.200 --> 13:42.601
And you, button,
are none of those things.

13:47.040 --> 13:50.522
- Harvard Law School?
- That's right.

13:52.120 --> 13:56.045
- But that's a top-three school.
- I have a 4.0.

13:56.200 --> 14:00.046
Yes. But your major
is fashion merchandising.

14:01.920 --> 14:05.766
Harvard won’t be impressed
that you aced History of Polka Dots.

14:09.840 --> 14:10.807
What are your backups?

14:10.960 --> 14:13.770
I don't need backups.
I'm going to Harvard.

14:15.120 --> 14:19.842
Well, then. You'll need excellent
recommendations from your professors.

14:20.040 --> 14:21.405
OK.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.928
- And a heck of an admissions essay.
- Right.

14:25.080 --> 14:30.120
And at least a 175 on your LSATs.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.448
I once had to judge a tighty-Whitey
contest for Lambda Kappa Pi.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.881
Trust me. I can handle anything.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.843
- Thanks.
- Welcome.

14:47.920 --> 14:52.164
Because I have a metrabolism.
I have a really high metrabolism.

14:52.320 --> 14:53.810
It's metabol...

14:57.800 --> 15:01.168
Oh, my God. What are you doing?

15:02.280 --> 15:04.123
Reading about the LSATs.

15:05.280 --> 15:08.887
My cousin had that.
You get a really bad rash on your...

15:11.560 --> 15:15.360
The LSATs are an exam.
Girls, I'm going to Harvard.

15:15.520 --> 15:17.727
- You mean, like, on vacay?
- Let's all go!

15:17.880 --> 15:19.370
Road trip!

15:21.080 --> 15:23.731
No. I'm going to Harvard Law School.

15:25.760 --> 15:27.000
Why?

15:27.840 --> 15:29.604
Elle. Elle...

15:29.760 --> 15:33.162
I know you're upset about all this,
but can't you just take a Percocet?

15:34.240 --> 15:38.848
OK. Once Warner sees me as a serious
law student, he'll totally want me back.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.202
It's a completely brilliant plan.

15:41.680 --> 15:44.286
But isn't it hard
to get into law school?

15:44.440 --> 15:46.647
I have the highest GPA in Delta Nu.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.209
Oh, well. Here.
You're gonna need this.

15:53.320 --> 15:56.642
- Your scrunchie?
- My lucky scrunchie.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.768
It helped me pass Spanish!

15:58.920 --> 16:01.605
You passed Spanish because
you gave Professor Montoya

16:01.760 --> 16:03.330
a lap dance after the final.

16:03.520 --> 16:06.729
Yeah. Luckily.

16:13.560 --> 16:15.722
Oh, hi.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.566
My name is Elle Woods,
and for my admissions essay,

16:19.720 --> 16:24.760
I’m gonna tell all of you at Harvard
why I’m gonna make an amazing lawyer.

16:24.960 --> 16:26.689
As president of my sorority,

16:26.880 --> 16:29.201
I’m skilled at commanding the
attention of a room,

16:29.360 --> 16:31.089
and discussing very important issues.

16:31.240 --> 16:33.208
It has come to my attention
that the maintenance staff

16:33.360 --> 16:38.241
is switching our toilet paper
from Charmin to generic.

16:38.400 --> 16:40.607
All those opposed to chafing, say “aye“.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.250
Aye!

16:43.040 --> 16:46.647
"A: Neither type of opera
or neither type of rap is on sale.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.168
B: Neither type of jazz
and neither type of opera is on sale.

16:50.360 --> 16:53.603
- C: Neither type of opera..."
- (men hollering)

16:54.440 --> 16:57.967
- Party!
- Delta Nu, we love you!

16:58.160 --> 17:00.811
Hey. Mm-mm.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.610
OK.

17:02.760 --> 17:06.401
I'm able to recall hundreds of
important details at the drop of a hat.

17:06.560 --> 17:10.609
Hey, Elle, do you know what happened
on Days of Our Lives yesterday?

17:10.760 --> 17:12.603
Why yes, Margot, I do.

17:12.800 --> 17:15.804
Once again, we joined Hope
in the search for her identity.

17:15.960 --> 17:18.849
She's been brainwashed
by the evil Stefano.

17:20.319 --> 17:22.971
- Three...
- Get set, and go!

17:33.040 --> 17:35.122
143.

17:39.200 --> 17:42.841
I feel comfortable
using legal jargon in everyday life.

17:43.040 --> 17:46.010
I object!

18:02.280 --> 18:04.601
Elle! It's here.

18:04.760 --> 18:06.250
The LSAT scores!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.650
179!

18:30.200 --> 18:32.965
179! 179!

18:41.520 --> 18:44.410
And that’s why
you should vote for me, Elle Woods,

18:44.600 --> 18:47.809
future lawyer;
for the class of 2004.

18:54.040 --> 18:56.930
She does have a 4.0 from CULA,

18:57.080 --> 19:00.050
and she got a 179 on her LSATs.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.210
A fashion major?

19:02.720 --> 19:04.563
Well, sir, we've never had one before,

19:04.720 --> 19:06.563
and aren't we always
looking for diversity?

19:06.720 --> 19:10.247
Her list of extracurricular
activities is impressive.

19:10.400 --> 19:14.644
- She was in a Ricky Martin video.
- Clearly, she's interested in music.

19:15.560 --> 19:17.927
She also designed a line of...

19:18.080 --> 19:22.404
...faux-fur panties
for her sorority's charity project.

19:22.560 --> 19:26.281
She's a friend to the animals,
as well as a philanthropist.

19:27.880 --> 19:29.245
Elle Woods.

19:32.080 --> 19:34.162
Welcome to Harvard.

19:37.000 --> 19:38.684
(Lisa Loeb
"We Could Still Belong Together")

19:38.840 --> 19:42.287
♫ We could still belong together

19:42.440 --> 19:45.683
♫ And together is much better

19:45.840 --> 19:49.765
♫ We're OK so, hey, don't worry now

19:49.920 --> 19:52.526
♫ Oh, wow

19:52.680 --> 19:56.082
♫ We could still belong together

19:56.240 --> 19:59.642
♫ And together's so much better

19:59.840 --> 20:03.925
♫ We're OK so, hey, don't worry now

20:04.080 --> 20:06.162
♫ Oh, wow

20:35.600 --> 20:38.843
Oh, Bruiser, it's so exciting.
Look! Harvard.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.162
Are you excited?

20:51.800 --> 20:54.167
This is our new house
for the next three years.

20:54.320 --> 20:55.685
Oh, are you thirsty?

20:55.840 --> 20:57.729
OK, let's get you some water.

20:58.760 --> 21:01.206
Sweetheart, you just look perched.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.448
Hey, Brad,
check out Malibu Barbie.

21:04.480 --> 21:06.209
Where's the beach, honey?

21:07.320 --> 21:09.971
There you go. Good boy.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.322
Warner's gonna be so excited to see you.

21:13.080 --> 21:14.411
Guys, this way.

21:14.560 --> 21:16.562
- This ain't LA!
- Come on, Bruiser.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.681
Check it out. Look at the way she walks.

21:22.440 --> 21:26.081
It's gonna be so exciting.
Don't be soared, everyone will love you.

21:31.040 --> 21:33.361
Hi. Woods comma Elle.

21:38.320 --> 21:40.448
Class schedule, map, book list.

21:44.440 --> 21:47.649
Wait a second.
My social events calendar is missing.

21:48.240 --> 21:49.571
Your what?

21:49.720 --> 21:52.485
Social events.
You know, mixers, formals,

21:52.640 --> 21:54.881
clambakes, trips to the Cape.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.647
OK. Has Warner Huntington III
checked in yet?

22:04.040 --> 22:05.326
No.

22:05.480 --> 22:08.404
Maybe you should check with
the cruise director on the lido deck.

22:11.320 --> 22:13.607
OK. Welcome to law school.

22:14.080 --> 22:16.401
This is the pan where we
go around in a circle

22:16.600 --> 22:19.968
and everyone says
a little bit about themselves.

22:20.400 --> 22:21.765
Let's start with you.

22:22.840 --> 22:24.569
My name is David Kidney.

22:24.720 --> 22:27.724
I have a Master's
in Russian literature,

22:27.880 --> 22:30.611
a PhD in biochemistry, and...

22:30.760 --> 22:35.448
...for the last 18 months,
I've been deworming orphans in Somalia.

22:37.400 --> 22:41.610
- Awesome. What about you?
- Hey. How you doin'? I'm Enid Wexler.

22:41.760 --> 22:43.603
Got a PhD from Berkeley
in women's studies,

22:43.760 --> 22:46.081
emphasis in the history of combat.

22:46.680 --> 22:48.808
Last year, I single-handedly organized

22:48.960 --> 22:50.962
the march for Lesbians
Against Drunk Driving.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.805
- Killer.
- Thanks. Good times.

22:54.680 --> 22:57.650
Aaron Mitchell. I graduated
first in my class from Princeton.

22:57.800 --> 23:00.246
I have an IQ of 187.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.570
It's been suggested that Stephen Hawking
stole his Brief History of Time...

23:05.960 --> 23:07.962
...from my fourth-grade paper.

23:08.120 --> 23:10.043
Cool.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.368
- Me?
- Yeah.

23:12.520 --> 23:16.844
OK. Hi. I'm Elle Woods
and this is Bruiser Woods.

23:17.040 --> 23:19.122
We're both Gemini vegetarians.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.365
I have a bachelor's degree
in fashion merchandising from CULA.

23:23.520 --> 23:25.648
And I was a Zeta Lambda Nu Sweetheart,

23:25.840 --> 23:27.649
president of my sorority, Delta Nu,

23:27.840 --> 23:30.161
and last year I was Homecoming Queen.

23:31.240 --> 23:34.449
Oh! Two weeks ago
I saw Cameron Diaz at Fred Segal,

23:34.640 --> 23:37.371
and I talked her out of buying
this truly heinous angora sweater.

23:37.560 --> 23:40.962
Whoever said orange was
the new pink was seriously disturbed.

23:46.240 --> 23:47.526
Wish me luck, Bruiser.

23:47.680 --> 23:50.365
This is my first class
as a serious law student.

23:56.760 --> 23:59.286
I totally look the part.

24:08.040 --> 24:09.087
Hi.

24:10.760 --> 24:11.886
Hey.

24:30.840 --> 24:32.649
Elle?

24:33.800 --> 24:37.361
Warner?
I totally forgot you go here.

24:37.720 --> 24:40.166
What are you talking about?

24:40.320 --> 24:42.402
I'm sorry. Are you here to see me?

24:42.560 --> 24:45.325
No, silly. I go here.

24:45.760 --> 24:49.970
- You go where?
- Harvard. Law School.

24:50.120 --> 24:52.851
You got into Harvard Law?

24:53.440 --> 24:55.044
What, like it's hard?

24:55.200 --> 24:57.089
Oh, my gosh. It's gonna be so great.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.607
I'm planning this great mixer.
You totally have to help me.

24:59.760 --> 25:02.411
I’m thinking, like,
a luau or maybe a casino night.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.490
This is gonna be just
like senior year, except for funner.

25:06.440 --> 25:07.487
Uh-huh.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.048
Oh, time to go. I have to go to class,

25:10.200 --> 25:13.283
but meet me after,
on the benches, OK? Bye!

25:30.160 --> 25:32.606
A legal education...

25:32.800 --> 25:36.600
...means you will
learn to speak in a new language.

25:38.000 --> 25:43.006
You will be taught to achieve
insight into the world around you,

25:43.160 --> 25:46.801
and to sharply question what you know.

25:49.080 --> 25:51.924
The seat you have picked will be yours

25:52.080 --> 25:55.129
for the next nine months of your life!

25:56.280 --> 25:58.009
And those of you in the front row...

26:00.200 --> 26:01.281
.. beware.

26:03.800 --> 26:07.486
"The law is reason free from passion."

26:07.640 --> 26:11.008
Does anyone know
who spoke those immortal words?

26:13.640 --> 26:15.165
Yes?

26:15.320 --> 26:16.810
Aristotle.

26:22.360 --> 26:24.840
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

26:25.000 --> 26:28.322
Would you be willing
to stake your life on it?

26:30.160 --> 26:31.286
I think so.

26:34.480 --> 26:35.925
What about...

26:36.760 --> 26:38.171
- OW!
- ...his life?

26:42.800 --> 26:45.610
- I don't know.
- Well...

26:45.760 --> 26:49.082
...I recommend
knowing before speaking.

26:49.720 --> 26:54.009
The law leaves much room
for interpretation...

26:54.160 --> 26:57.289
...but very little for self-doubt.

26:58.720 --> 27:00.085
And you were right.

27:01.760 --> 27:05.048
- It was Aristotle.
- Good job.

27:06.360 --> 27:09.887
Now, I assume all of you
have read pages one through 48,

27:10.040 --> 27:13.203
and are now well-versed
in subject matter jurisdiction.

27:13.400 --> 27:17.041
Who can tell us
about Gordon v. Steele?

27:17.200 --> 27:19.885
Let's call on someone from the hot zone.

27:37.440 --> 27:39.010
Elle Woods?

27:40.320 --> 27:42.129
Oh...

27:43.400 --> 27:47.007
Actually, I wasn't aware
that we had an assignment.

27:51.000 --> 27:52.923
Oh.

27:59.560 --> 28:01.085
Vivian Kensington.

28:01.680 --> 28:05.002
Do you think it's acceptable
that Ms. Woods is not prepared?

28:06.280 --> 28:07.611
No.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.971
I don't.

28:12.560 --> 28:15.962
Would you support my decision
to ask her to leave class,

28:16.120 --> 28:19.124
and to return only
when she is prepared?

28:19.840 --> 28:21.126
Absolutely.

28:40.000 --> 28:41.365
Now, Ms. Kensington...

28:41.520 --> 28:44.683
Did diversity jurisdiction
exist in this case?

28:44.840 --> 28:46.968
No, it did not.

28:48.280 --> 28:50.442
Good. However, in the case of...

29:05.000 --> 29:07.367
Excuse me. Are you OK?

29:08.680 --> 29:10.011
Yeah.

29:10.160 --> 29:13.721
But do they put you on the spot
like that, like, all the time?

29:13.880 --> 29:17.851
The professors? Yeah, they tend
to do that. Socratic method.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.327
So, if you don't know the answer,
they're just gonna kick you out?

29:22.480 --> 29:26.246
- So you have Stromwell, huh?
- Yes! Did she do that to you too?

29:26.400 --> 29:28.607
No. But she did make me cry once.

29:28.760 --> 29:30.728
Not in class, I waited till
I got back to my room.

29:30.880 --> 29:33.201
But she'll kick you right in the ball...

29:33.360 --> 29:34.771
Or wherever, you know.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.207
But, yeah, she's tough. Really tough.

29:38.120 --> 29:39.167
Great.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.891
Don't worry, though. It gets better.
Who else do you have?

29:42.440 --> 29:46.047
I have Callahan, Royalton,
and Levinthal.

29:46.200 --> 29:49.204
Yeah. Let's see.
Speak up in Callahan's class.

29:49.360 --> 29:51.010
He really likes people
that are opinionated.

29:51.160 --> 29:53.925
And in Royalton's class...

29:55.600 --> 29:57.204
...try to get a seat in the back.

29:57.360 --> 30:00.489
He tends to spit when
he talks about products liability.

30:00.640 --> 30:04.406
And... for Levinthal,
make sure you read the footnotes,

30:04.560 --> 30:07.325
'cause that's where he gets
a lot of his exam questions from.

30:07.800 --> 30:08.881
Right.

30:10.880 --> 30:13.645
Wow. I'm really glad I met you.

30:15.160 --> 30:18.687
- Hey.
- Are you a third-year?

30:18.840 --> 30:21.127
- Well, I'm a...
- Hey, Elle.

30:21.280 --> 30:22.566
Hi.

30:22.720 --> 30:25.007
- Thanks for all your help.
- Good luck.

30:27.560 --> 30:29.961
- Hi, Warner.
- Hi...

30:31.080 --> 30:33.048
So...

30:33.200 --> 30:35.521
- How was your first class?
- It was good,

30:35.680 --> 30:36.966
except for this horrible preppy girl

30:37.120 --> 30:40.567
who tried to make me look bad in front
of the professor, but no biggie.

30:40.720 --> 30:43.041
You're here now.
So how was your summer?

30:43.200 --> 30:44.929
Good. It was good.

30:45.080 --> 30:46.570
Did you do anything exciting?

30:49.280 --> 30:50.884
Hey!

30:51.040 --> 30:54.601
Have... Have you met Viv... ian?

30:54.760 --> 30:57.286
Oh, hi. Vivian Kensington.

30:59.840 --> 31:02.207
- Do you know her?
- She's...

31:02.360 --> 31:04.442
I'm his fiancée.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.088
I'm sorry. I just hallucinated.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.810
What?

31:15.960 --> 31:17.928
Yeah... She...

31:18.080 --> 31:20.924
She was my girlfriend in prep school.

31:21.080 --> 31:25.404
Well, we got back together this summer
at my grandmother's birthday party.

31:26.040 --> 31:27.690
Warner told me all about you.

31:28.200 --> 31:30.680
You're famous at our club.

31:31.480 --> 31:33.403
But he didn't tell me you'd be here.

31:34.240 --> 31:36.561
Pooh Bear, I didn't know
she would be here.

31:40.320 --> 31:41.560
Excuse me.

31:53.480 --> 31:55.881
Hey, watch out!

31:58.880 --> 32:00.211
Thank God!

32:17.080 --> 32:19.401
Are you free?
It's an emergency.

32:20.160 --> 32:24.210
- Bad day?
- You can't even imagine.

32:27.200 --> 32:28.201
Spin.

32:28.360 --> 32:31.364
I worked
so hard to get into law school.

32:32.000 --> 32:34.321
I blew off Greek Week
to study for the LSATS.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.086
I even hired a Coppola
to direct my admissions video.

32:37.240 --> 32:39.049
All to get my boyfriend Warner back,

32:39.200 --> 32:41.726
and now he's engaged
to this awful girl, Vivian.

32:41.880 --> 32:45.282
So it was all for nothing, and I...
I just wish...

32:46.520 --> 32:49.649
...I just wish I had
never gone to Harvard.

32:50.440 --> 32:54.047
- After you went to all that trouble.
- He's engaged.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.768
She's got the six-carat Harry Winston
on her bony, unpolished finger.

33:01.920 --> 33:03.888
What am I supposed to do?

33:04.080 --> 33:06.401
You're askin' the wrong girl.

33:06.560 --> 33:10.645
I mean, I'm with my guy eight years,
and then one day it's,

33:10.840 --> 33:13.286
"I met someone else. Move out."

33:13.440 --> 33:16.922
Oh, no. That's awful.

33:17.080 --> 33:20.323
Dewey kept the trailer
and my precious baby, Rufus.

33:23.760 --> 33:25.762
I didn't even get to throw him
a birthday party.

33:25.920 --> 33:27.888
No!

33:28.040 --> 33:30.088
I mean, what's a girl to do?

33:30.240 --> 33:34.086
He's a guy who followed
his pecker to greener pastures,

33:34.280 --> 33:37.090
and I'm a middle-aged
high school dropout...

33:37.840 --> 33:40.366
...who's got stretch marks
and a fat ass.

33:41.120 --> 33:45.364
- That's terrible.
- Yeah. Happens every day.

33:47.480 --> 33:50.450
So what's this Vivian got
that you don't have?

33:50.600 --> 33:51.761
Three tits?

33:51.960 --> 33:55.965
She's from Connecticut.
She belongs to his stupid country club.

33:56.120 --> 33:57.849
Is she as pretty as you?

33:59.240 --> 34:02.642
She could use some mascara
and some serious highlights, but...

34:02.800 --> 34:05.485
...she's not completely
unfortunate-looking.

34:07.880 --> 34:09.962
Hello, ladies. How ya doin'?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.884
Sign here.

34:20.639 --> 34:22.449
Oh, look what I did.

34:22.600 --> 34:24.489
- See you later.
- Bye, sugar.

34:26.639 --> 34:28.130
Oh, shit.

34:28.600 --> 34:31.331
Could I have been
any more goddamn spastic?

34:32.000 --> 34:33.161
It's OK.

34:34.520 --> 34:38.002
Are you sure this Warner guy
is, like, the one?

34:38.159 --> 34:41.130
Definitely. I love him.

34:41.800 --> 34:43.370
Mmm...

34:44.320 --> 34:47.688
If a girl like you
can't hold on to her man,

34:47.840 --> 34:51.639
then there sure as hell
isn't any hope for the rest of us.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.650
What are you waitin' for?

34:56.719 --> 34:58.961
Steal the bastard back.

35:04.160 --> 35:06.367
I should warn you, that in addition
to competing against each other

35:06.520 --> 35:09.091
for the top grade in this class,

35:09.240 --> 35:11.481
you will also be competing
for one of my firm's

35:11.640 --> 35:15.440
highly-coveted four internship
spots next year,

35:15.600 --> 35:19.047
where you will get
to assist on actual cases.

35:19.200 --> 35:21.601
Let the bloodbath begin.

35:23.360 --> 35:26.364
Now, let's commence
with our usual torture.

35:27.960 --> 35:29.724
Ms. Woods.

35:30.600 --> 35:34.127
Would you rather have a client
who committed a crime malum in se,

35:34.280 --> 35:36.203
or malum prohibitum?

35:40.800 --> 35:43.485
- Neither.
- Why is that?

35:44.360 --> 35:46.761
I would rather have
a client who's innocent.

35:49.160 --> 35:51.401
Dare to dream, Ms. Woods.

35:54.600 --> 35:57.171
Ms. Kensington, which would you prefer?

35:58.320 --> 35:59.765
Malum prohibitum.

36:01.520 --> 36:04.763
Because then the client would've
committed a regulatory infraction,

36:04.920 --> 36:07.241
as opposed to a dangerous crime.

36:07.400 --> 36:09.607
Well done, Ms. Kensington.

36:09.760 --> 36:12.047
You've obviously done your homework.

36:12.880 --> 36:16.930
Now, let us look at malum prohibitum
a little more closely.

36:17.080 --> 36:18.570
It has been said...

36:18.720 --> 36:19.926
Yes, Ms. Woods?

36:21.160 --> 36:23.925
I changed my mind.
I'd pick the dangerous one,

36:24.080 --> 36:26.287
'cause I'm not afraid of a challenge.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.161
Hike!

36:40.120 --> 36:41.121
Who is that?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.206
Guys...

36:50.720 --> 36:54.770
- Hi!
- Warner, do you know her?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.126
Hi.

37:04.960 --> 37:07.361
- Hi, everybody.
- Elle. What are you doing here?

37:07.520 --> 37:10.444
I've come to join your study group.
And look, I brought sustenance.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.524
- Who's first?
- Mm-mm. Mm-mm. Our group is full.

37:15.760 --> 37:20.163
- Oh, is this like an RSVP thing?
- No, it's like a smart-people thing.

37:20.320 --> 37:22.561
And, as Viv said, we're full.

37:22.760 --> 37:25.366
Come on, guys.
We can make room for one more.

37:25.520 --> 37:28.205
- OW!
- We've already assigned the outlines.

37:29.920 --> 37:31.729
The answer is no.

37:39.680 --> 37:42.524
OK. I'll just leave, then.

37:44.000 --> 37:45.286
Bye.

37:50.680 --> 37:54.401
Hey, maybe there's, like, a sorority
you could, like, join instead, like...

37:54.560 --> 37:57.040
You know, if you had come
to a rush party,

37:57.200 --> 37:58.531
I would have at least been nice to you.

37:58.680 --> 38:00.921
Oh, is that before
you voted against me,

38:01.080 --> 38:02.844
then called me a dyke behind my back?

38:03.360 --> 38:05.567
I don't use that word.

38:05.760 --> 38:07.364
You must have heard it from Vivian.

38:34.080 --> 38:36.367
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

38:36.520 --> 38:37.726
It's Elle!

38:37.880 --> 38:40.167
Guess what I'm doing right this second?

38:40.320 --> 38:42.243
I don’t know. What?

38:42.400 --> 38:44.721
I'm picking out my wedding dress!

38:44.920 --> 38:47.526
- What?
- Josh proposed.

38:48.920 --> 38:50.410
Did you get the rock yet?

38:52.360 --> 38:53.646
Almost.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.963
Well, hurry up, so you can come home.
We miss you.

38:57.120 --> 39:00.283
I miss you guys too.
The people here are so vile.

39:00.480 --> 39:02.926
- Hardly anybody speaks to me, unless...
- Oh, my God.

39:03.080 --> 39:04.684
I almost forgot to tell you.

39:05.240 --> 39:07.766
- What?
- I got bangs.

39:07.920 --> 39:09.922
- My hair is so ”now. ”
- Really?

39:10.440 --> 39:13.603
OK, so just listen to me.
Keep June 1st open.

39:13.760 --> 39:17.765
You're one of my bridesmaids.
And give Warner our love.

39:17.920 --> 39:20.400
Because I'm getting married!
I'm getting...

39:29.960 --> 39:33.681
So don't forget.
Eight o'clock at 45 Dunstan Street.

39:33.840 --> 39:35.649
It'll be a really nice party.

39:36.120 --> 39:39.408
Oh, and don't forget
to bring your own merlot.

39:39.600 --> 39:42.968
No way! Is somebody at this school
actually... having a party?

39:43.800 --> 39:45.484
YES.

39:47.120 --> 39:50.010
But it's a costume party.
You probably wouldn't wanna come.

39:51.960 --> 39:53.769
I love costume parties.

39:53.920 --> 39:57.925
Oh. Well, then,
I guess we'll see you there.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.326
OK.

40:01.560 --> 40:05.326
Oh. At 45 Dunstan Street. OK.

40:23.640 --> 40:25.290
Oh, my God!

40:32.000 --> 40:33.331
Hey.

40:43.360 --> 40:46.682
Thanks for inviting me, girls.
This party is super fun.

40:48.080 --> 40:51.209
- Nice outfit.
- Oh, I like your outfit, too.

40:51.360 --> 40:53.442
Except when I dress up
as a frigid bitch,

40:53.600 --> 40:55.887
I try not to look so constipated.

40:59.840 --> 41:02.002
She's horrible.

41:02.600 --> 41:04.045
You've got the ring, sweetie.

41:09.080 --> 41:10.047
How you doin'?

41:10.200 --> 41:14.728
Warner! The English language
is all about subliminal domination.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.565
Take the word, "semester," OK?
This is a perfect example

41:17.720 --> 41:20.246
of this school's discriminatory
preference of semen to ovaries.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.767
That's why I'm petitioning
to have next term be referred to

41:22.920 --> 41:24.410
as the winter "ovester."

41:24.560 --> 41:26.722
Excuse me. Hey, Warner.

41:26.920 --> 41:30.163
Wow. Well, don't you look
like a walking felony?

41:30.320 --> 41:32.971
- Thank you. You're so sweet.
- Ugh!

41:33.120 --> 41:35.930
- Are you having fun?
- I am now.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.401
What... What's with the costume?

41:38.560 --> 41:40.801
Oh. I just decided to dress up.

41:40.960 --> 41:41.961
Really?

41:42.120 --> 41:45.010
You know, I feel like we barely get to
see each other since we've been here.

41:45.160 --> 41:48.289
I know. I'm so busy
with these case studies and hypos.

41:48.480 --> 41:50.687
I know you mean.
I can't imagine doing all this

41:50.840 --> 41:53.081
and Callahan's internship next year.

41:53.280 --> 41:55.044
This is gonna be so much.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.287
Oh, Elle...

41:56.440 --> 41:58.169
Come on, you're never
gonna get the grades

41:58.320 --> 41:59.970
to qualify for one of those spots.

42:00.600 --> 42:02.921
You're not smart enough, sweetie.

42:04.520 --> 42:08.241
Wait. Am I on glue, or did we not
get into the same law school, Warner?

42:08.400 --> 42:10.607
- Well, yeah, but...
- But what?

42:10.760 --> 42:14.287
We took the same LSATs,
and we’re taking the same classes.

42:14.440 --> 42:18.445
I know. But come on, Elle, be serious.

42:18.600 --> 42:20.967
You can do something
more valuable with your time.

42:25.080 --> 42:27.367
I'm never gonna be
good enough for you, am I?

42:33.200 --> 42:35.089
- Elle, come on.
- Just forget it.

42:38.600 --> 42:41.331
I'll show you how valuable
Elle Woods can be.

42:53.520 --> 42:56.330
- Don't ask.
- Wasn't gonna.

43:07.360 --> 43:09.840
I love that sweater. It's Chanel.

43:11.520 --> 43:14.967
- Look.
- Is she carrying books?

43:24.040 --> 43:25.405
Thanks.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.285
So, you've filed a claim.

43:30.840 --> 43:32.046
What next?

43:33.680 --> 43:35.170
Ms. Woods?

43:37.520 --> 43:40.763
- Don't you need to have evidence?
- Meaning?

43:41.720 --> 43:44.610
Meaning you need reasonable belief

43:44.760 --> 43:49.971
that your claim should have, like,
evidentiary support?

43:52.360 --> 43:56.888
And what kind of evidentiary support
does this case require?

43:57.880 --> 43:59.405
Yo quiero Taco Bell.

44:06.240 --> 44:08.208
Welcome back...

44:10.280 --> 44:13.124
In the article, you talk
about all sorts of things:

44:13.280 --> 44:14.725
corrupt cops. .. ..

44:26.480 --> 44:28.881
And the purpose
of diminished capacity is?

44:31.280 --> 44:33.089
To negate mens rea?

44:52.960 --> 44:54.121
Are you ready?

44:54.280 --> 44:57.170
No.

44:57.320 --> 44:59.322
Yes. Yes, you are.

44:59.480 --> 45:01.562
Go. You can do this.

45:04.520 --> 45:07.285
"Listen to me, Dewey.
You shut your mouth."

45:07.920 --> 45:10.127
No. "You shut your big mouth."

45:11.840 --> 45:13.888
"I'm doing all the talking."

45:24.520 --> 45:27.888
What the hell do you want?
We're eatin' lunch.

45:28.040 --> 45:30.520
I just thought that...

45:30.680 --> 45:34.810
You just thought you could come and
show me what I'm definitely not missin'?

45:37.640 --> 45:39.847
That's not why I came by.

45:40.000 --> 45:43.368
Paulette, how many times you gonna
come here beggin' me to take you back?

45:43.960 --> 45:46.930
I was... I...

45:47.080 --> 45:49.924
- Dewey Newcombe?
- Who's askin'?

45:51.040 --> 45:54.487
I'm Elle Woods,
Ms. Bonifante's attorney.

45:54.840 --> 45:57.207
And I'm here to discuss
the legal situation at hand.

45:58.200 --> 45:59.531
Come again?

45:59.680 --> 46:02.968
Do you understand
what subject matter jurisdiction is?

46:03.120 --> 46:05.168
- No.
- I didn't think so.

46:05.360 --> 46:08.842
Well, due to... habeas corpus,

46:09.000 --> 46:12.368
you and Ms. Bonifante
had a common law marriage,

46:12.520 --> 46:16.969
which, heretofore, entitles her
to what is legally referred to

46:17.120 --> 46:20.203
as "equitable division of the assets."

46:21.360 --> 46:22.361
Come again?

46:22.920 --> 46:27.323
Due to the fact that you've retained...
this residence...

46:27.480 --> 46:30.882
...Ms. Bonifante is entitled
to full canine property ownership,

46:31.040 --> 46:32.929
and will be enforcing said ownership...

46:34.040 --> 46:35.041
...right now.

46:36.120 --> 46:38.930
- Huh?
- Tell him, Paulette.

46:44.480 --> 46:47.802
I'm takin' the dog... dumbass!

46:49.360 --> 46:52.170
We did it!

46:55.520 --> 46:57.648
Come here.

46:57.800 --> 47:00.929
Oh, my gosh, did you see him?
He's probably still scratching his head.

47:01.080 --> 47:03.890
Which must be
a nice vacation for his balls.

47:06.280 --> 47:08.248
Oh...

47:13.760 --> 47:15.171
Thank you.

47:20.960 --> 47:22.849
According to
Swinney vs. Neubert...

47:23.000 --> 47:25.241
Swinney, who was also
a private sperm donor,

47:25.440 --> 47:27.886
was allowed visitation rights
as long as he came to terms

47:28.040 --> 47:30.042
with the hours set forth by the parents.

47:30.240 --> 47:35.167
So, if we're sticking to past precedent,
I mean, Mr. Latimer wasn't stalking.

47:35.880 --> 47:38.724
He was clearly within his rights
to ask for visitation.

47:38.880 --> 47:42.123
But Swinney was
a one-time sperm donor.

47:42.280 --> 47:45.682
And, in our case, the defendant
was an habitual sperm donor,

47:45.880 --> 47:49.885
who also happens to be harassing
the parents in his quest for visitation.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.407
Well, yeah, but I mean,
without this man's sperm...

47:53.120 --> 47:55.885
...the child in question wouldn't exist.

47:56.040 --> 47:58.008
Now you're thinking like a lawyer.

48:03.000 --> 48:04.490
Yes, Ms. Woods?

48:05.480 --> 48:07.767
Although Mr. Huntington
makes an excellent point,

48:07.920 --> 48:10.810
I have to wonder
if the defendant kept a thorough record

48:10.960 --> 48:13.804
of every sperm emission
made throughout his life.

48:16.720 --> 48:18.484
Interesting. Why do you ask?

48:18.640 --> 48:21.803
Well, unless the defendant attempted

48:22.000 --> 48:24.002
to Contact every single
one-night stand

48:24.160 --> 48:26.527
to determine if a child
resulted in those unions,

48:26.680 --> 48:29.524
he has no parental claim
over this child, whatsoever.

48:29.680 --> 48:31.603
Why now? Why this sperm?

48:33.120 --> 48:36.090
- I see your point.
- And for that matter,

48:36.240 --> 48:40.006
all masturbatory emissions where his
sperm was clearly not seeking an egg,

48:40.160 --> 48:41.810
could be termed reckless abandonment.

48:43.280 --> 48:46.090
I believe you've just won your case.

48:50.800 --> 48:54.009
- Ms. Woods, you did well today.
- Really?

48:55.200 --> 48:56.645
You're applying
for my internship, aren't you?

48:57.840 --> 48:59.604
- I don't know.
- Well, you should.

48:59.760 --> 49:02.809
- Do you have a résumé?
- Yes, I do.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.646
Here it is.

49:10.360 --> 49:12.522
- it's pink.
- Oh, and it's scented.

49:12.680 --> 49:15.251
I think it gives it a little
something extra, don't you think?

49:18.000 --> 49:19.490
OK. Well, see you next class.

49:24.360 --> 49:26.249
Do you think she woke up
one morning and said,

49:26.440 --> 49:28.681
"I think I'll go to law school today?"

49:28.840 --> 49:32.731
Well, that lapse in judgment aside,
I think she's got a lot of potential.

49:33.440 --> 49:35.522
Here's the Windham file.

49:35.960 --> 49:37.485
Smell this.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.640
- What's that?
- It's her résumé.

49:43.440 --> 49:44.885
It smells good.

50:09.080 --> 50:10.650
What's going on?

50:10.800 --> 50:13.201
Callahan's firm
is defending a murder trial.

50:13.400 --> 50:16.768
His case load is so big,
he's taking on first-year interns.

50:16.920 --> 50:20.481
- He picked 'em already?
- I can't believe it, Warner!

50:21.280 --> 50:23.123
- We got it!
- Yes.

50:24.640 --> 50:26.881
That only leaves one for...

50:32.360 --> 50:33.486
Me!

50:34.480 --> 50:35.811
Yes!

50:40.480 --> 50:41.766
Oh, Warner.

50:46.480 --> 50:49.689
Do you remember when
we spent those four amazing hours

50:49.840 --> 50:51.808
in the hot tub after Winter Formal?

50:51.960 --> 50:54.201
Yeah... No.

50:55.040 --> 50:57.771
This is so much better than that!

50:58.760 --> 51:00.603
Excuse me. I have some shopping to do.

51:02.640 --> 51:04.768
Four hours?

51:25.640 --> 51:28.120
You look very nice today, Vivian.

51:28.960 --> 51:31.566
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

51:42.520 --> 51:46.002
We're defending Brooke Windham,
whose very wealthy husband

51:46.200 --> 51:48.771
was found shot dead
in their Beacon Hill mansion.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.809
- Gold-digger?
- You'd think so,

51:51.000 --> 51:54.209
since the stiff was 60,
but she was rich on her own.

51:54.360 --> 51:55.691
Some kind of fitness empire.

51:55.880 --> 51:58.281
You can buy her exercise tapes
on infomercials.

51:58.440 --> 52:01.011
Wait, are you
talking about Brooke Taylor?

52:02.920 --> 52:06.242
Maiden name, Taylor. You know her?

52:06.400 --> 52:09.131
She's a Delta Nu.
She wasn't in my pledge class.

52:09.280 --> 52:11.282
She graduated four years before me.

52:11.480 --> 52:14.165
But I used to take her class
at the Los Angeles Sports Club.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.731
She's amazing.

52:16.400 --> 52:17.526
"Amazing?" How?

52:17.680 --> 52:19.967
She can make you lose
three pounds in one class.

52:20.120 --> 52:22.202
She's completely gifted.

52:22.360 --> 52:25.045
Well, in all likelihood,
she's completely guilty as well.

52:25.560 --> 52:27.927
She was seen standing
over her husbands body.

52:28.120 --> 52:29.565
By who?

52:29.720 --> 52:32.246
His 26-year-old daughter
and the pool boy.

52:33.200 --> 52:37.489
- Sorry I'm late. Excuse me.
- This is Emmett Richmond, an associate.

52:37.640 --> 52:41.201
Top three in his class
and former editor of Harvard Law Review.

52:41.760 --> 52:44.764
You've probably seen him lurking
around campus doing my research.

52:44.920 --> 52:46.763
Thanks for the introduction.

52:46.920 --> 52:48.570
So, what about
the murder weapon?

52:48.720 --> 52:50.324
The gun is missing.

52:50.520 --> 52:53.091
Coroner said he'd been dead
30 minutes when the cops arrived,

52:53.240 --> 52:55.129
giving Brooke
plenty of time to stash it.

52:55.600 --> 52:57.204
I just don't think Brooke
could have done this.

52:58.160 --> 53:01.607
Exercise gives you endorphins.
Endorphins make you happy.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.649
Happy people just don't
shoot their husbands.

53:06.160 --> 53:07.571
They just don't.

53:08.320 --> 53:09.765
I didn't do it.

53:10.480 --> 53:13.450
I walked in. I saw my husband
lying on the floor.

53:14.280 --> 53:16.362
I bent down to check his heart,
screamed my head off,

53:16.520 --> 53:17.965
and then Enrique
and Chutney ran inside.

53:18.120 --> 53:20.646
OK, your stepdaughter
and the pool boy came in,

53:20.840 --> 53:24.242
where they saw you standing
over the body, covered in his blood.

53:27.280 --> 53:28.964
Why would I kill my husband?

53:29.120 --> 53:32.408
Insurance? A love affair?
Pure unadulterated hatred?

53:32.600 --> 53:34.887
Believe me, the DA will
come up with plenty of reasons.

53:35.640 --> 53:36.846
I loved him.

53:38.160 --> 53:40.891
He was 34 years older than you.

53:41.040 --> 53:43.771
That doesn't look so good to a jury.

53:43.920 --> 53:45.490
Then show them a picture of his dick.

53:46.560 --> 53:48.403
That might clear a few things up.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.408
Brooke, I believe you.

53:53.560 --> 53:56.450
But a jury is gonna want an alibi.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.602
Well, I can't give you that.

53:58.760 --> 54:01.491
And if you put me
on the stand, I'll lie.

54:02.640 --> 54:05.530
Well, then,
I guess we're done for today.

54:14.560 --> 54:16.767
- Hey. I know you.
- Hi.

54:16.920 --> 54:20.083
I'm a Delta Nu.
And I'm a huge fan of yours.

54:20.840 --> 54:22.968
- You took my class in LA.
- Uh-huh.

54:23.120 --> 54:25.487
You had the best high kick
I've ever seen.

54:26.360 --> 54:29.204
- Are you one of my lawyers?
- Yeah, sort of.

54:30.000 --> 54:32.401
Well, thank God one of you has a brain.

54:32.560 --> 54:33.561
Let's go.

54:37.960 --> 54:38.847
(KC & The Sunshine Band
"That's The Way I Like it")

54:39.040 --> 54:41.327
I'm the only one that believes her.
Callahan totally thinks she's guilty.

54:41.480 --> 54:44.211
That's 'cause men
are big fat retards who don't...

54:45.520 --> 54:48.888
- Afternoon, ladies.
- it's him.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.967
Paulette Bonifante.

54:52.480 --> 54:53.766
Oh, my God.

54:56.240 --> 54:57.685
He's coming over here.

55:01.560 --> 55:02.971
I've got a package.

55:06.440 --> 55:07.566
He's got a package.

55:20.720 --> 55:24.167
- How you doin' today?
- Fine.

55:30.600 --> 55:32.090
Take it easy.

55:33.480 --> 55:35.448
- See you later.
- Take it easy.

55:36.760 --> 55:38.125
That's great, Paulette.

55:38.280 --> 55:40.203
Is this the only interaction
you two have ever had?

55:40.360 --> 55:41.930
No!

55:42.080 --> 55:44.526
Sometimes I say, "OK,"
instead of "fine."

55:46.360 --> 55:50.490
Why don't you offer him a cold beverage,
or a neck massage, or something?

55:50.640 --> 55:55.009
- Oh, come on, what's the point?
- Trust me. You have all the equipment.

55:55.200 --> 55:56.611
You just need to read the manual.

55:57.960 --> 55:59.291
Do you know what I'm saying?

56:00.800 --> 56:04.043
I'm gonna show a little maneuver
that my mother taught me in junior high.

56:04.200 --> 56:07.329
In my experience,
it has a 98 percent success rate

56:07.480 --> 56:10.324
of getting a man's attention and,
when used appropriately,

56:10.480 --> 56:13.848
it has an 83 percent rate
of return on a dinner invitation.

56:14.000 --> 56:15.206
Wow.

56:15.680 --> 56:19.287
It's called the "bend and snap."
Watch this.

56:22.320 --> 56:25.961
I think I dropped something
that I need to pick up.

56:26.120 --> 56:28.521
So you bend...

56:28.680 --> 56:31.331
...and snap. See?

56:31.480 --> 56:32.811
Come on. You try.

56:37.320 --> 56:39.800
Bend... and snap.

56:40.280 --> 56:41.327
OK...

56:41.480 --> 56:44.290
Yeah. A little less bend,
a little more snap.

56:45.000 --> 56:46.240
Like this?

56:47.440 --> 56:49.329
Good snap! Come on.

56:51.280 --> 56:54.443
You! Come on. You can do it.

56:54.600 --> 56:57.001
Bend... and snap.

56:59.880 --> 57:02.770
We can all do it. Come on, guys!

57:04.160 --> 57:07.369
You're gonna bend... and snap.

57:07.520 --> 57:08.760
Now put your head into it.

57:08.920 --> 57:11.082
Bend... and snap.

57:11.960 --> 57:14.088
Bend... and snap.

57:14.280 --> 57:17.523
Good job!
A little attitude, please.

57:18.160 --> 57:20.367
Now, everybody, smile.
That's very important.

57:21.360 --> 57:23.044
Pump! Pump, pump!

57:23.200 --> 57:25.567
Bend... and snap.

57:25.720 --> 57:27.563
Good job, everybody.

57:28.720 --> 57:30.882
Work it out! Work it out!

57:32.800 --> 57:34.450
Wow!

57:35.560 --> 57:36.846
Come on, Paulette.

57:38.480 --> 57:40.847
Bend... and snap.

57:41.000 --> 57:45.210
Oh, my God. The bend and snap.
Works every time.

57:46.880 --> 57:49.645
Well, if Brooke didn't kill the guy,
then who did?

57:49.800 --> 57:52.531
My money is on
the angry daughter or the ex-wife.

57:52.680 --> 57:53.886
Chutney has a trust fund.

57:54.040 --> 57:56.361
She didn't need the insurance payoff
or the inheritance.

57:56.520 --> 57:59.000
- What about the mother?
- Covered. She was in Aspen.

57:59.200 --> 58:00.929
Vivian, get me some plum sauce.

58:01.120 --> 58:04.761
Ten people saw her downing
cosmopolitans at the Caribou Club.

58:04.920 --> 58:09.403
- All I know is that it's not Brooke.
- That's touching. But we need an alibi.

58:12.880 --> 58:17.249
I brought you some necessities.
Some Calvin Klein 720-count sheets,

58:17.400 --> 58:19.562
the entire Clinique skincare line,

58:19.760 --> 58:22.809
some aromatherapy candles, a loofah....

58:22.960 --> 58:24.564
Oh!

58:24.720 --> 58:26.927
And... the bible.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.927
You're an angel.

58:30.080 --> 58:32.321
So how are you? Are you all right?

58:32.480 --> 58:35.245
You look so... orange.

58:35.400 --> 58:38.563
I'm just glad that it's you
and not Callahan.

58:39.320 --> 58:41.322
He means well. He's very brilliant.

58:41.480 --> 58:43.767
He better be,
for what I'm paying for him.

58:45.400 --> 58:47.641
I have to tell you
the real reason I came here.

58:47.800 --> 58:50.804
Professor Callahan says
we really, really need your alibi.

58:51.440 --> 58:54.489
Elle, I can't.

58:55.400 --> 58:59.325
- I mean, you don't understand.
- Who could understand better than me?

59:00.880 --> 59:02.848
It's so shameful.

59:03.000 --> 59:05.162
Whatever it is, Brooke,
it could save you.

59:05.320 --> 59:07.971
No, that's just it.
It would ruin me.

59:08.600 --> 59:09.601
How?

59:12.960 --> 59:16.328
I've made my fortune on the ability
to perfect women's bodies

59:16.480 --> 59:17.970
with Brooke's butt-buster workout.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.408
- You helped me go from a six to a four.
- That's great!

59:25.760 --> 59:27.808
On the day of Heyworth's murder...

59:36.480 --> 59:37.845
What?

59:38.000 --> 59:39.206
I was getting...

59:41.160 --> 59:42.844
- Huh?
- Liposuction!

59:43.000 --> 59:44.650
Oh, God!

59:44.800 --> 59:47.451
- No!
- I know! I'm a fraud!

59:47.640 --> 59:49.961
But it's not like normal women
can have this ass!

59:50.680 --> 59:53.843
If my fans knew that I bought it,
I would lose everything.

59:55.800 --> 59:57.802
I've already lost my husband.

01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:04.051
I'd rather go to jail
than lose my reputation.

01:00:05.480 --> 01:00:06.845
Brooke...

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:09.528
...your secret's safe with me.

01:00:12.840 --> 01:00:14.683
Thank you.

01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:18.045
Vivian, grab me some coffee.

01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:21.890
We got two interviews tomorrow
that Gerard and Bobby are gonna handle,

01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:23.087
and the ex-wife in an hour.

01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:25.891
According to this Communiqué
from the prison,

01:00:26.040 --> 01:00:28.566
our client apparently
had a visit from her sister.

01:00:29.840 --> 01:00:32.571
A Miss Delta Nu.

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:37.760
- Anyone you know?
- Yes. I went to visit her.

01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:39.845
What the hell do you mean,
you "went to visit her"?

01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:41.240
I went to get her alibi.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:44.961
- Did you get it?
- Mm-hmm. It's really good.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.448
Well, great. What is it?

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.207
- Oh, I can't tell you.
- Why the hell not?

01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.567
Because I promised her
I'd keep it a secret.

01:00:53.720 --> 01:00:55.404
And I can't break
the bonds of Sisterhood.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:56.971
Screw Sisterhood!

01:00:57.120 --> 01:01:00.090
This is a murder trial,
not some scandal at the sorority house.

01:01:00.240 --> 01:01:02.163
I want the alibi.

01:01:02.320 --> 01:01:06.450
I can't give it to you.
But I can tell you she is innocent.

01:01:07.320 --> 01:01:10.244
Mr. Callahan, Mrs. Windham
Vandermark is on line two for you.

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:13.609
Someone reason with her
while I take this.

01:01:15.320 --> 01:01:17.482
Are you crazy?
Just tell him the alibi.

01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:19.881
- No!
- We'll lose the case if you don't.

01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:21.769
Then we're not very good lawyers.

01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:24.890
If you tell him, he'll probably
hire you as a summer associate.

01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:28.010
Who cares about Brooke?
Think about yourself.

01:01:30.440 --> 01:01:33.603
- I gave her my word, Warner.
- So what?

01:01:37.800 --> 01:01:39.564
The ex-wife seems to be unconcerned

01:01:39.720 --> 01:01:41.484
with the fact that
her interview is today.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:44.041
- She's at a spa in the Berkshires.
- A spa.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:46.885
Isn't that kind of like
your mother ship?

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.010
I could go if you want me to.

01:01:49.160 --> 01:01:50.366
- Emmett.
- Yeah?

01:01:50.560 --> 01:01:53.131
- Go with her.
- OK.

01:02:03.800 --> 01:02:07.327
- She seems completely untrustworthy.
- Why?

01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.725
This is a person who's made her
living by telling women they're too fat.

01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:14.247
Brooke would never
tell a woman that she was too fat.

01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:17.210
And she seems to me
like she's hiding something.

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.681
- Maybe it's not what you think.
- Maybe it's exactly what I think.

01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.803
You know,
you're really being a butthead.

01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:28.080
A butthead?
Why would you call me that?

01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.245
You just need to have a little more
faith in people. You might be surprised.

01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:36.165
I can't believe you just
called me a butthead.

01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:38.721
No one's called me that
since about the ninth grade.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:42.043
Maybe not to your face.

01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:48.366
So this is what a spa looks like.
Wow. How do we find her?

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:52.844
- I called ahead. She's in the mud room.
- She's not... naked, is she?

01:02:55.680 --> 01:02:57.170
Mrs. Windham Vandermark?

01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.002
So, you found me.

01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:05.529
Yes. We're from Austen,
Platt, Jaret & Callahan.

01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:07.728
We're here to ask you a few questions.

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:12.805
So, I hear that that little tart
from California shot poor Heyworth.

01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:15.971
Well, that's what we're trying
to prove didn't happen.

01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:18.043
Do you have any reason
to believe that it did?

01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:21.086
Well, I've never actually met the woman.

01:03:21.240 --> 01:03:24.164
But my daughter tells me
she can be quite the little bitch.

01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:27.402
Now, did your daughter
ever mention anything to you

01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.370
about the relationship
between Brooke and Heyworth?

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:34.487
Well, she did say that
they humped like gorillas.

01:03:35.680 --> 01:03:38.889
I guess it wasn't enough,
though, for Brooke.

01:03:39.600 --> 01:03:42.729
- Why do you say that?
- Well...

01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:44.763
Haven't you seen the cabana boy?

01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:50.243
- She's lying.
- And you know this for a fact?

01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.562
Did you see the icky brown
color of her hair?

01:03:52.760 --> 01:03:55.889
So? Now you discriminate
against brunettes?

01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.407
Why shouldn't I?
I'm discriminated against as a blonde.

01:03:58.600 --> 01:04:00.887
You know, being a blonde
is actually a pretty powerful thing.

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.769
You hold more cards
than you think you do.

01:04:02.920 --> 01:04:05.810
I personally would like
to see you take that power

01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:08.930
and channel it
towards the greater good.

01:04:09.920 --> 01:04:12.810
- Thanks. I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right.

01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.008
- Hey.
- Yeah?

01:04:16.200 --> 01:04:18.089
How do you think I'd look as a blond?

01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:20.561
Hmm... I'm not sure you could handle it.

01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:23.290
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.125
So I called
your room last night.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:35.361
I heard.

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.648
I was thinking maybe
we could go out sometime.

01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:39.962
No. You're a dork.

01:04:40.520 --> 01:04:42.682
I'm in... law school.

01:04:42.840 --> 01:04:44.649
Look, I'm not gonna go out with you.

01:04:44.800 --> 01:04:46.802
I can't believe you'd even ask.

01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.281
Girls like me don't go out
with losers like you.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:51.805
Let's get out of here.

01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:53.485
Excuse me.

01:04:57.480 --> 01:04:59.801
- Why didn't you call me?
- What?

01:04:59.960 --> 01:05:03.089
We spent a beautiful night together,
and I never hear from you again?

01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.481
I'm sorry?

01:05:08.640 --> 01:05:10.324
Sorry for what? For breaking my heart?

01:05:10.480 --> 01:05:12.847
Or for giving me the greatest
pleasure I've ever known

01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.048
and then just taking it away?

01:05:17.480 --> 01:05:18.811
Both?

01:05:19.280 --> 01:05:22.363
Well, forget it. I've already spent
too many hours crying over you.

01:05:26.800 --> 01:05:29.644
So... when did you wanna go out?

01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:37.488
Come in.

01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:44.842
Are you done with that deposition yet?

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:48.761
Oh, yeah. Here, take it.
I've read it, like, 20 times.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.203
OK.

01:05:58.520 --> 01:05:59.726
You know, Elle...

01:06:01.240 --> 01:06:04.767
I still can't believe you
didn't tell Callahan the alibi.

01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:07.889
It's not my alibi to tell.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.403
I know. And I thought
that was very...

01:06:12.440 --> 01:06:13.930
...classy of you.

01:06:15.640 --> 01:06:18.564
- Really?
- Sure.

01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:21.006
Thanks.

01:06:29.040 --> 01:06:33.204
Did you ever notice how Callahan never
asks Warner to bring him his coffee?

01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:36.807
I mean, he's asked me
at least ten times.

01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:39.329
Well, men are helpless. You know that.

01:06:40.720 --> 01:06:42.802
I know.
Warner doesn't do his own laundry.

01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:46.521
- I know. He has to have it sent out.
- I know.

01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:51.368
Did you know, when he first applied...

01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:54.842
- ...he got wait-listed?
- What?

01:06:56.840 --> 01:06:58.808
His father had to make a call.

01:06:59.600 --> 01:07:01.762
- You're kidding.
- Mm-mm!

01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:04.927
No way!

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:12.287
Oh, God.
That is such a precious dog. Hi.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.568
His name is Bruiser.
Do you wanna hold him?

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:17.363
- He's very friendly.
- Sure.

01:07:21.920 --> 01:07:23.888
Look, he likes you.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:26.042
Oh, he's giving me kisses.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:30.161
Thanks, Jeff.

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:32.971
We're here today covering
the trial of Brooke Windham.

01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:35.600
You may remember, she's charged
with the murder of her husband,

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:38.286
Boston millionaire Heyworth Windham.

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:41.649
First to testify are the victim's
daughter and ex-wife.

01:07:41.800 --> 01:07:44.326
Superior Court
of Suffolk County is now in session.

01:07:44.480 --> 01:07:46.642
The Honorable Judge
Marina R. Bickford presiding.

01:07:46.800 --> 01:07:48.245
You may be seated.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.843
And where was she exactly?

01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.480
Standing over my father's dead body.

01:08:03.360 --> 01:08:05.283
And what was the defendant doing?

01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.324
She was sitting
next to the pool, topless...

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.648
...while the Latin boy
handed her a drink.

01:08:14.720 --> 01:08:18.087
Mr. Salvatore,
can you tell us what this is?

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:20.881
My uniform.

01:08:22.240 --> 01:08:24.242
This is the uniform

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:28.450
that Mrs. Windham asked you
to wear while cleaning her pool?

01:08:31.520 --> 01:08:32.520
YES.

01:08:33.600 --> 01:08:36.763
And are you, or are you not,
having an affair with Brooke Windham?

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:41.520
Define "affair."

01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:45.725
Have you and Mrs. Windham
had sexual relations?

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.724
Yes. OK? Yes.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:59.201
Ladies and gentlemen, court will
reconvene tomorrow morning at 9 am.

01:08:59.399 --> 01:09:00.890
We're adjourned.

01:09:04.399 --> 01:09:06.050
You know a Delta Nu
would never sleep with a man

01:09:06.240 --> 01:09:07.729
- who wears a thong.
- Never!

01:09:07.880 --> 01:09:09.723
I just liked watching him
clean the filter.

01:09:10.359 --> 01:09:12.362
I know. I believe you, Brooke.

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.966
- Take care of me, Elle.
- I will.

01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.569
I got a big one for you.

01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:45.091
Can you sign?

01:10:21.640 --> 01:10:22.641
I got it.

01:10:27.320 --> 01:10:30.164
- You broke his nose?
- Oh, I blew it, Elle.

01:10:30.320 --> 01:10:32.402
My snap was all over the place.

01:10:32.560 --> 01:10:35.962
I'll be there when court is out.
We have to cross-examine Enrique.

01:10:36.120 --> 01:10:37.804
But my girlfriend, Serena,
once barfed on a guy

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.526
during The Blair Witch Project, and
they ended up dating for three months.

01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.889
- Really? All right. Bye-bye.
- OK, bye.

01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:59.771
Don't stomp your little
last-season Prada shoes at me, honey.

01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:02.725
They're not last season.

01:11:09.520 --> 01:11:10.851
Emmett.

01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.162
He's gay. Enrique is gay.

01:11:13.320 --> 01:11:14.481
What?

01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:16.927
Warner, what kind of shoes are these?

01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:19.441
- Black ones.
- See?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.888
- What are you talking about?
- He's gay. He isn't Brooke's lover.

01:11:23.040 --> 01:11:25.202
- He's making it up.
- Wait. Back up.

01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:28.011
- How do you know that he's gay?
- Gay men know designers.

01:11:28.160 --> 01:11:30.561
- Straight men don't.
- You know what?

01:11:30.760 --> 01:11:32.922
He did leave a Cher tape
in the pool house one time.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.401
While I appreciate
your masterful legal theory,

01:11:37.600 --> 01:11:39.523
I have a murder trial to attend to.

01:11:41.040 --> 01:11:42.769
- Emmett.
- OK.

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:47.888
- I'll take care of it. Thanks.
- OK.

01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:49.610
Court will come to order.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:58.731
Mr. Salvatore, do you have any proof

01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:02.885
that you and Mrs. Windham
were having an affair?

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:05.124
Only the love in my heart.

01:12:06.080 --> 01:12:10.768
Well, if that's all the proof that he
has, Your Honor, I think I'm done here.

01:12:11.840 --> 01:12:14.320
- You may step down.
- I'd like to ask a couple of questions.

01:12:16.240 --> 01:12:18.322
Just give me a couple of minutes.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:22.802
Did you ever take
Mrs. Windham on a date?

01:12:23.320 --> 01:12:24.890
- Yes.
- Where?

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:27.691
A restaurant in Concord,
where no one could recognize us.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.763
How long have you been
sleeping with Mrs. Windham?

01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:31.490
- Three months.
- And your boyfriend's name is?

01:12:31.640 --> 01:12:32.971
- Chuck.
- Right.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:39.371
Silence! Silence!

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:41.761
- Pardon... Pardon me.
- Yes, Mr. Salvatore?

01:12:41.960 --> 01:12:43.086
I was confused.

01:12:43.240 --> 01:12:46.164
I thought you said "friend,"
Chuck is just a friend.

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.800
- Oh, OK.
- You bitch!

01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:51.566
Chuck, wait!

01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.726
Silence in my court.
Sit down, Mr. Salvatore.

01:12:57.800 --> 01:13:00.087
Silence in my courtroom!

01:13:00.800 --> 01:13:02.290
How did I miss that?

01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.849
Silence in my courtroom.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:10.171
- Thanks.
- Wow.

01:13:13.080 --> 01:13:14.730
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:13:18.480 --> 01:13:21.529
Oh, Elle. Callahan asked
to see you before you leave.

01:13:21.680 --> 01:13:23.489
- Really?
- Yeah, you know, he has his coffee,

01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:25.130
but maybe he needs a donut.

01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.209
- Do you need help?
- No, I'm fine.

01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:29.805
OK. Bye.

01:13:34.880 --> 01:13:36.211
Come on in.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:39.161
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:13:39.320 --> 01:13:41.448
- Sit down.
- OK.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:50.686
Is everything all right?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:55.968
You followed your intuition today,
and you were right on target.

01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.928
- I should have listened.
- Thank you.

01:14:02.480 --> 01:14:04.482
- About the alibi.
- I'm sorry...

01:14:04.640 --> 01:14:07.689
I'm impressed that you took
the initiative to go there and get it.

01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:09.725
That's what makes a good lawyer.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:13.530
On top of that, you gained
the client's trust and kept it.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.409
That's what makes a great lawyer.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:18.050
You're smart, Elle.

01:14:18.880 --> 01:14:21.087
Smarter than most
of the guys on my payroll.

01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:23.086
Wow.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.647
I think it's time
to discuss your career path.

01:14:26.800 --> 01:14:30.486
Have you thought about
where you might be a summer associate?

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:35.320
Oh... not really.
I know it's very competitive.

01:14:35.480 --> 01:14:38.563
Well, you know what
competition’s really about, don’t you?

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:44.161
It's about ferocity. Carnage.

01:14:44.800 --> 01:14:49.488
Balancing human intelligence
with animal diligence.

01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:53.085
Knowing exactly what you want...

01:14:53.520 --> 01:14:56.205
...and how far you'll go to get it.

01:14:57.480 --> 01:15:00.768
How far will Elle go?

01:15:04.080 --> 01:15:07.243
- Are you hitting on me?
- You're a beautiful girl.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.846
- So everything you just said...
- I'm a man who knows what he wants.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:18.050
And I'm a law student who just realized
her professor is a pathetic asshole.

01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:22.642
Too bad. I thought you were
a law student who wanted to be a lawyer.

01:15:40.120 --> 01:15:43.408
- You almost had me fooled.
- What?

01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:45.723
Maybe you should sleep
with the jury too.

01:15:45.880 --> 01:15:47.564
Then we can win the case.

01:16:03.320 --> 01:16:05.402
- Hey.
- I'm quitting.

01:16:06.000 --> 01:16:08.321
- Why?
- Law school was a mistake.

01:16:08.480 --> 01:16:09.891
This whole internship was a mistake!

01:16:10.080 --> 01:16:11.730
What are you talking about?
You earned it.

01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:14.400
I didn't earn anything, Emmett.

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:18.167
Callahan only gave me that internship
because he liked the way I looked.

01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.607
Which he made clear tonight
when he tried to feel me up.

01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:24.088
Callahan did what?

01:16:26.160 --> 01:16:28.208
Just forget it.
I'm going back to LA.

01:16:28.360 --> 01:16:30.169
No more boring suits,
no more pantyhose.

01:16:30.320 --> 01:16:32.607
No more trying
to be something that I'm just...

01:16:33.600 --> 01:16:34.806
....I'm just not.

01:16:36.200 --> 01:16:38.521
What if you're trying
to be somebody you are?

01:16:39.880 --> 01:16:42.042
I mean, the hell with Callahan.

01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:45.205
Stay.

01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:51.127
Call me if you're
ever in California, OK?

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.571
What's the point
in staying, Paulette? I mean...

01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:16.046
All people see when they look at me
is blonde hair and big boobs.

01:17:16.200 --> 01:17:18.089
No one's ever gonna take me seriously.

01:17:18.240 --> 01:17:21.289
People at law school don't.
And Warner doesn't.

01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:25.285
I don't even think
my own parents take me seriously.

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:32.609
It just felt like, for the first time,
that someone expected me to...

01:17:34.000 --> 01:17:35.604
...to do something more with my life

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:38.730
than just become
a Victoria's Secret model.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.050
But I was just kidding myself.

01:17:43.800 --> 01:17:46.963
Callahan never saw me as a lawyer,
he just saw me as a piece of ass.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:49.449
Just like everybody else.

01:17:51.920 --> 01:17:53.763
Turns out I am a joke.

01:17:55.760 --> 01:17:57.410
No, you're not a joke.

01:18:05.840 --> 01:18:09.162
The hell with law school.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:15.365
If you're going to let
one stupid prick ruin your life...

01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:23.961
....you're not the girl
I thought you were.

01:18:41.720 --> 01:18:42.482
Did you go in there knowing how

01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:44.369
you were going
to discredit Mr. Salvatore?

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:49.242
Absolutely. it's a little thing
I like to call "strategy. ”

01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:51.482
You know, I had a feeling...

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.731
Is he always such an ass?

01:18:53.880 --> 01:18:56.087
He's the top defense attorney
in the state.

01:18:56.240 --> 01:18:57.287
Of course he's an ass.

01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:59.886
Fine, but is he an ass
that's gonna win my case?

01:19:00.960 --> 01:19:02.883
Well, he's an ass that's gonna try.

01:19:03.040 --> 01:19:06.283
- He thinks I'm guilty, doesn't he?
- That's not what's important.

01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:09.046
If he doesn't trust me,
why should I trust him?

01:19:09.200 --> 01:19:12.329
Ask Elle. She looked pretty cozy
with him last night.

01:19:12.480 --> 01:19:14.881
No. You don't even know what
the hell you're talking about.

01:19:17.320 --> 01:19:18.651
What's going on here?

01:19:19.920 --> 01:19:21.729
- Elle quit.
- What?

01:19:21.880 --> 01:19:24.531
Yeah. Callahan hit on her, so she quit.

01:19:25.280 --> 01:19:28.443
Oh, my God. Scumbag.

01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:31.480
- Oh, God.
- What?

01:19:32.880 --> 01:19:36.805
I feel terrible. I made a huge mistake.

01:19:43.040 --> 01:19:46.567
Well, maybe there's something
we can do about it.

01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:51.366
Thank you.

01:19:56.360 --> 01:19:58.966
What are you so happy about?
You're on trial for murder.

01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:00.451
Get up.

01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:04.201
- What?
- You're fired.

01:20:04.400 --> 01:20:06.164
I have new representation.

01:20:07.200 --> 01:20:08.247
Who?

01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:35.809
- Excuse you. You're in my way.
- She's a student. She can't defend you.

01:20:35.960 --> 01:20:40.568
Massachusetts Supreme
Judicial Court Ruling 3.03.

01:20:40.880 --> 01:20:41.881
See?

01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.600
- Thank you, David.
- Counselors, approach the bench.

01:20:47.440 --> 01:20:49.727
- You're not going up there.
- Oh, yes, I am.

01:20:49.880 --> 01:20:52.724
I'm sorry. Maybe you
didn't hear me. You're fired.

01:20:53.080 --> 01:20:56.527
Counselors, now! All of you.

01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:02.485
Elle Woods, Your Honor.

01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:06.326
Rule 3.03 of Supreme Judicial Court
states that a law student

01:21:06.480 --> 01:21:08.881
may appear on behalf
of a defendant in criminal proceedings

01:21:09.040 --> 01:21:11.407
Your Honor,
I have no problem with this.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.882
- I do. I'm not allowing it.
- But you agreed last night.

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:17.247
In your office,
when we were discussing my career?

01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:23.845
The ruling also states that you need
a licensed attorney to supervise you.

01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.049
- Mr. Callahan?
- That I won't agree to.

01:21:27.200 --> 01:21:29.567
I'll supervise, Your Honor.

01:21:30.600 --> 01:21:33.080
Well, then, Ms. Woods, proceed.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.204
Thank you, Your Honor.

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:43.291
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:50.731
Enjoy prison.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:55.680
Mrs. Windham,
you do realize what you're doing?

01:21:55.840 --> 01:21:57.171
Absolutely.

01:21:59.880 --> 01:22:04.522
- Oh, my God. There she is. Elle!
- Elle, we came to see your trial.

01:22:04.680 --> 01:22:09.527
Oh, look, how cute! There's, like,
a judge and everything. And jury people.

01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:13.211
- Vote for Elle!
- Ladies, take a seat.

01:22:14.160 --> 01:22:16.288
Go, girl.

01:22:20.360 --> 01:22:23.523
Do you swear to tell the whole truth and
nothing but the truth, so help you God?

01:22:23.680 --> 01:22:25.364
- I do.
- Be seated.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:29.801
Ms. Woods, you may
begin your questioning.

01:22:34.920 --> 01:22:37.491
First of all, I would like
to point out that,

01:22:37.680 --> 01:22:39.523
not only is there
no proof in this case,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:43.930
but there's a complete
lack of mens rea,

01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.801
which, by definition,
tells us that there can be no crime

01:22:47.960 --> 01:22:50.167
without a... vicious will.

01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:53.925
I am aware of the meaning of mens rea.

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:57.562
What I'm unaware of is why
you're giving me a vocabulary lesson

01:22:57.720 --> 01:23:00.166
when you should be
questioning your witness.

01:23:02.360 --> 01:23:03.930
Yes, Your Honor.

01:23:07.360 --> 01:23:08.566
Ms. Windham...

01:23:09.280 --> 01:23:11.408
When you arrived back at the house...

01:23:12.840 --> 01:23:13.966
...was your father there?

01:23:14.680 --> 01:23:16.762
Not that I saw. But like I said,

01:23:16.920 --> 01:23:19.127
I went straight upstairs
to take a shower.

01:23:20.400 --> 01:23:24.803
And... when you came downstairs,
what happened?

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.443
I saw Brooke standing over his body...

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:31.042
...drenched in his blood.

01:23:36.680 --> 01:23:41.322
- But Mrs. Windham didn't have a gun?
- No, she'd stashed it by then.

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:43.289
Move to strike that
from the record, Your Honor.

01:23:43.440 --> 01:23:45.442
- It's speculation.
- So stricken.

01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.241
Go ahead.

01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:57.410
Ms. Windham, did you hear a shot fired?

01:23:57.960 --> 01:23:59.883
No. I was in the shower.

01:24:01.280 --> 01:24:02.361
OK.

01:24:02.520 --> 01:24:06.127
So... sometime in the 20 minutes

01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:07.964
that you were in the shower...

01:24:08.800 --> 01:24:09.961
...your father was shot?

01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:11.801
I guess.

01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:15.930
Your father was shot
while you were in the shower...

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.683
...but you didn't
hear the shot because...

01:24:23.520 --> 01:24:25.443
...because you were in the shower?

01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:30.480
Yes. I was washing my hair.

01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.246
- Where is she going with this?
- Have a little faith, Gerard.

01:24:45.720 --> 01:24:49.566
Ms. Windham,
what had you done earlier that day?

01:24:50.560 --> 01:24:53.006
I got up, got a latte,

01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.289
went to the gym,
got a perm and came home.

01:24:58.680 --> 01:25:00.887
Where you got in the shower?

01:25:01.600 --> 01:25:05.764
I believe the witness has made it
clear that she was "in the shower."

01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:13.689
Yes, Your Honor.

01:25:13.840 --> 01:25:17.447
Ms. Windham,
had you ever gotten a perm before?

01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.850
- Yes.
- How many, would you say?

01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:24.201
Two a year since I was 12.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.411
You do the math.

01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:30.409
You know, a girl in my sorority,
Tracy Marcinko, got a perm once.

01:25:30.600 --> 01:25:33.809
We all tried to talk her out of it.
Curls weren't a good look for her.

01:25:34.360 --> 01:25:35.930
She didn't have your bone structure.

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:37.081
Aww.

01:25:37.240 --> 01:25:39.561
But thankfully, that same day,

01:25:39.720 --> 01:25:41.722
she entered the Beta Delta Pi
wet T-shirt contest,

01:25:41.880 --> 01:25:43.723
where she was completely
hosed down from head to toe.

01:25:43.880 --> 01:25:46.850
Objection! Why is this relevant?

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:50.129
- I have a point. I promise.
- Then make it.

01:25:50.920 --> 01:25:52.570
Yes, ma'am.

01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:57.006
Chutney, why were Tracy Marcinko's
curls ruined when she got hosed down?

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:00.649
- Because they got wet.
- Exactly.

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.411
Because isn't it the first cardinal
rule of perm maintenance

01:26:03.560 --> 01:26:05.767
that you're forbidden
to wet your hair for at least 24 hours

01:26:05.920 --> 01:26:07.888
after getting a perm
at the risk of deactivating

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:12.170
- the ammonium thioglycolate?
- Yes...

01:26:12.320 --> 01:26:15.449
And wouldn't somebody who's had,
say 30 perms before in their life

01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:17.602
be well aware of this rule?

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.650
And if you weren't washing your hair,
as I suspect you weren't,

01:26:20.800 --> 01:26:24.009
because your curls are still intact,
wouldn't you have heard the gunshot?

01:26:24.160 --> 01:26:26.811
And if, in fact, you had heard the
gunshot, Brooke Windham

01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:29.964
wouldn't have had time to hide
the gun before you got downstairs,

01:26:30.160 --> 01:26:32.845
which would mean that you would've
had to have found Mrs. Windham

01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:36.522
with a gun in her hand to make
your story plausible. Isn't that right?

01:26:36.680 --> 01:26:39.047
She's my age, did she tell you that?

01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:41.521
How would you feel if your father
married someone your age?

01:26:41.680 --> 01:26:44.206
You, however, had time to hide the gun,
didn't you, Chutney?

01:26:44.360 --> 01:26:46.840
- After you shot your father.
- I didn't mean to shoot him!

01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.207
I thought it was you
walking through the door!

01:26:52.560 --> 01:26:55.882
Order! Order! Order.

01:26:57.600 --> 01:26:59.841
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:01.809
Oh, my God.

01:27:03.560 --> 01:27:05.688
Bailiff, take the witness into custody,

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.969
where she will be charged
for the murder of Heyworth Windham.

01:27:09.800 --> 01:27:12.406
In the matter of
The State v. Brooke Windham,

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:14.244
this case is dismissed.

01:27:14.400 --> 01:27:16.482
Mrs. Windham, you are free to go.

01:27:16.640 --> 01:27:17.641
Yes!

01:27:34.120 --> 01:27:37.408
- How did you know Chutney was lying?
- Because she's brilliant, of course.

01:27:37.600 --> 01:27:39.602
The rules of hair care
are simple and finite.

01:27:39.760 --> 01:27:41.489
Any Cosmo girl would've known.

01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:46.600
Elle! Elle. Elle. Elle.

01:27:47.360 --> 01:27:48.521
What?

01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:51.160
I just wanted to say that you were...

01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:52.810
...so brilliant in there.

01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:56.644
And that... I was wrong.

01:27:57.480 --> 01:28:01.166
And... you are the girl for me.

01:28:02.320 --> 01:28:03.845
- Really?
- Yes.

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:05.446
Pooh Bear...

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:08.005
...I love you.

01:28:09.160 --> 01:28:10.525
Oh, Warner.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:13.885
I've waited so long
to hear you say that.

01:28:16.160 --> 01:28:18.766
But if I'm gonna be a partner in
a law firm by the time I'm 30,

01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.571
I need a boyfriend who's
not such a complete bonehead.

01:28:26.360 --> 01:28:28.442
Thank you, boys.

01:28:34.440 --> 01:28:36.568
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present the graduates

01:28:37.840 --> 01:28:42.129
of Harvard Law School. Class of 2004.

01:28:44.520 --> 01:28:46.921
I am personally very honored

01:28:47.080 --> 01:28:50.801
to introduce this year's
class-elected speaker.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:55.489
After getting off to a quite
interesting start here at Harvard,

01:28:55.680 --> 01:28:59.127
she graduates today
with an invitation to join

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:02.841
one of Boston's
most prestigious law firms.

01:29:03.480 --> 01:29:07.530
I am sure we are going
to see great things from her.

01:29:07.680 --> 01:29:11.605
Ladies and gentlemen, Elle Woods.

01:29:33.080 --> 01:29:37.847
On our very first day at Harvard,
a very wise professor quoted Aristotle.

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:42.164
"The law is reason free from passion."

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:47.283
Well, no offense to Aristotle,
but in my three years at Harvard,

01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.927
I have come to find
that passion is a key ingredient

01:29:51.080 --> 01:29:55.130
to the study and practice
of law... and of life.

01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:00.642
It is with passion, courage of
conviction, and strong sense of self

01:30:00.800 --> 01:30:03.724
that we take our next
steps into the world,

01:30:03.880 --> 01:30:07.168
remembering that first
impressions are not always correct.

01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:11.287
You must always have faith in people...

01:30:12.080 --> 01:30:14.162
...and most importantly...

01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.731
...you must always
have faith in yourself.

01:30:21.640 --> 01:30:24.484
Congratulations, class of 2004.

01:30:25.280 --> 01:30:26.611
We did it!
