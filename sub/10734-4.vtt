<b>1x24 - Vilgax Must Croak</b>

00:06.566 --> 00:11.286
We're in position for final
approach, warden K'dak.

00:11.321 --> 00:13.955
<i>Hold on, Plumber.
We've been evacuating this</i>

00:13.990 --> 00:17.614
<i>prison for a week.
Last convoy's leaving now ...</i>

00:17.649 --> 00:20.488
<i>then Incarcecon is all yours.</i>

00:20.523 --> 00:24.079
I don't see why we have to empty
out a whole prison for just one guy.

00:24.115 --> 00:27.140
<i>Ben, you of all people
should know that we can't trust</i>

00:27.176 --> 00:31.202
your guest around anybody else.
- He has been quite resourceful.

00:31.237 --> 00:34.768
Yeah, except for the
hundred times I've beaten him.

00:34.804 --> 00:37.501
<i>After you and your
security team lock him up and</i>

00:37.536 --> 00:41.166
<i>leave, the whole sector will be
off-limits to space traffic.</i>

00:41.201 --> 00:44.501
<i>Everything will be automated,
down to the food synthesizers.</i>

00:44.537 --> 00:47.046
<i>He'll be in total
solitary confinement ...</i>

00:47.047 --> 00:50.810
<i>no one around for him to
bribe, blackmail, or beat up.</i>

00:50.846 --> 00:54.283
<i>Am I supposed to be
flattered by all this?</i>

00:54.318 --> 00:57.552
Believe me, Vilgax,
I don't like it any more than you do.

00:57.588 --> 01:01.591
And believe me,
Tennyson, once I am free of this

01:01.626 --> 01:05.794
encumbrance, you'll like it even less.

All hail Lord emperor
Milleous, light of the Incursian empire,

02:16.765 --> 02:20.934
destroyer of entire galaxies, all
living creatures tremble in your ...

02:20.969 --> 02:24.971
<i>Daughter of mine, you
cannot hail me every time you're bored.</i>

02:25.007 --> 02:26.806
What'cha doing, daddy?

02:26.842 --> 02:30.511
<i>You know
exactly what I'm doing.</i>

02:30.546 --> 02:34.981
<i>I just surrounded Vilgaxia and
demanded their surrender.</i>

02:35.016 --> 02:36.716
<i>Can we talk later?</i>

02:36.751 --> 02:41.320
Boiling oceans, razing
cities, laying waste to billions.

02:41.355 --> 02:44.957
I wish I could be there.
- Kids today.

02:44.993 --> 02:48.194
<i>You don't think strategical.
These Vilgaxians are tough ...</i>

02:48.230 --> 02:52.650
<i>nearly as tough as us Incursians
... which means, as long as</i>

02:52.651 --> 02:57.071
<i>their leader's around, he poses
a disincentive to giving up.</i>

02:57.106 --> 02:58.472
So?

02:58.508 --> 03:02.209
<i>So, first thing we
do is demoralize 'em.</i>

03:05.347 --> 03:07.682
<i>And how do we do that?</i>

03:07.717 --> 03:11.719
By getting rid of Vilgax,
which is why you sent me to Incarcecon.

03:11.755 --> 03:15.756
<i>And with him out of the
picture, their whole system falls apart.</i>

03:15.792 --> 03:20.795
<i>Now, if you don't mind, I have
to broadcast another ultimatum.</i>

03:21.698 --> 03:26.334
<i>Attention Vilgaxian scum...</i>

03:26.369 --> 03:30.672
Sixsix, Sevenseven,
Eighteight ... you heard the man.

03:30.707 --> 03:33.841
Bring me the head of
Vilgax the conqueror!

03:38.414 --> 03:39.780
Don't be familiar.

03:39.815 --> 03:43.283
You will address me as General
or highest Commander.

03:52.460 --> 03:53.660
Whoa!

03:55.932 --> 04:02.136
Charging deflectors!
- Will that take long?!

04:02.171 --> 04:04.138
Unfortunately, yes.

04:32.301 --> 04:35.368
Rook, you okay?
- Yes.

04:35.404 --> 04:38.005
But I damaged the transport
during the landing.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.474
Yeah. Not our priority.

04:44.378 --> 04:45.711
Everybody in one piece?

04:45.747 --> 04:50.182
Well, since you asked,
I may have bruised my ...

04:50.217 --> 04:56.821
Good. Now we all have to
get off this ship, Vilgax included.

04:59.659 --> 05:02.093
I'm free! I'm ...

05:04.364 --> 05:06.965
Not.
And if you do try to escape,

05:07.000 --> 05:10.468
those shock manacles will
give you a little reminder.

05:16.142 --> 05:20.512
Now, everybody, hold
your breath. And then...

05:20.548 --> 05:22.514
jump.

05:47.242 --> 05:50.477
<i>Get off of me, you insect!</i>

05:52.548 --> 05:55.816
I am tired of you!

06:00.923 --> 06:03.123
Ben!
Calm down, Ben!

06:03.158 --> 06:07.227
Why should I ?!
He set us up!

06:08.297 --> 06:10.398
I had nothing to do with that attack.

06:10.433 --> 06:13.100
Yeah, right!
Pull the other tentacle!

06:13.136 --> 06:17.472
Look, use your
tiny brain. If they'd destroyed

06:17.473 --> 06:21.809
the ship, I would have
perished with the rest of you!

06:21.844 --> 06:27.547
He has a point.
- Hobble, do not help.

06:27.583 --> 06:29.549
Not buying it, Vilgax.

06:29.584 --> 06:32.619
You took a chance that you'd
make it out alive and we wouldn't.

06:32.654 --> 06:35.188
You'd do anything to get free.

06:59.514 --> 07:01.480
Hobble!
Are you in pain?

07:02.517 --> 07:08.554
Actually, it only hurts when I ...
Aah! ... breathe.

07:08.590 --> 07:12.091
This is all working out
just like you planned, isn't it?

07:12.126 --> 07:14.159
You don't care who gets hurt,
you rotten ...

07:14.195 --> 07:16.895
<i>Hey! Vilgax!
Ready to give up?</i>

07:16.930 --> 07:18.329
Not that it matters.

07:18.365 --> 07:20.832
You're toast anyway!
Shrimp toast!

07:20.867 --> 07:25.270
Ben, I do not believe
that they are trying to free Vilgax.

07:25.305 --> 07:27.238
What did I tell you?

07:30.863 --> 07:33.998
How shall we proceed, Ben?

07:34.034 --> 07:36.864
I'll distract Attea
while you do something ...

07:36.929 --> 07:41.573
I don't know ... techie.
- Understood.

07:44.811 --> 07:45.978
Hey, Attea ...

07:46.014 --> 07:48.982
Ben Tennyson!

07:50.051 --> 07:52.439
Why am I not surprised?

07:53.440 --> 07:56.022
I got a question.

07:56.057 --> 08:00.592
If a guy kisses you, do you
change into a Princess?

08:00.628 --> 08:04.963
I am a Princess!
Obliterate them!

08:12.237 --> 08:14.472
That certainly helped.

08:15.375 --> 08:17.676
We can't keep this up!

08:17.711 --> 08:19.411
What do you got for me, Rook?

08:19.446 --> 08:23.682
According to the prison database,
there is one escape pod left here.

08:23.717 --> 08:26.651
Plus, there is an auxiliary
communications room down there.

08:26.686 --> 08:29.221
Good. You take the
Plumbers to the comm room,

08:29.222 --> 08:31.756
shut off the blackout field,
and call Max for backup.

08:31.792 --> 08:33.991
Very well.
What will you do?

08:34.027 --> 08:37.395
I'll head for the hangar
with Vilgax and try to keep him alive.

08:37.431 --> 08:40.865
<i>I'm getting bored here!</i>

08:52.546 --> 08:55.515
Hope this doesn't bore you!

09:43.299 --> 09:45.903
Oh, ribbit.

09:50.874 --> 09:54.009
Okay, fellas, show's over.

09:55.613 --> 10:00.015
Huh?
Where's Vilgax?

10:02.086 --> 10:04.920
I know.
We were all knocked out.

10:04.956 --> 10:06.689
Use your tracker thingees!

10:12.229 --> 10:14.896
I have eyes,
Sevenseven. They split up.

10:14.932 --> 10:20.602
You two, find those Plumbers,
while I catch Tennyson and Vilgax.

10:20.637 --> 10:24.339
Eighteight, with me.

10:29.147 --> 10:31.714
Keep moving, Vilgax.
I want to make sure you spend

10:31.749 --> 10:35.117
the rest of your life nice and
safe and locked away.

10:36.287 --> 10:37.620
This is the thanks I get?

10:37.655 --> 10:42.492
After all, I'm the reason you have
the Omnitrix in the first place!

10:42.527 --> 10:44.694
Which you then tried to
steal, which began a long

10:44.729 --> 10:46.763
tradition of me whipping your butt.

10:46.798 --> 10:50.066
No, it didn't.
- Yeah, you're right.

10:50.101 --> 10:52.835
Oh, except for that time I
kicked you out into space, and

10:52.870 --> 10:56.271
that other time I kicked you out
into space, and in that arena.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.474
Oh! And when you got
blown up in the ocean.

10:58.509 --> 11:01.110
You see how there's a pattern
forming here?

11:01.146 --> 11:02.912
Oh, yes, I do.

11:02.947 --> 11:10.152
You've never truly defeated me
because you don't have the guts!

11:10.187 --> 11:13.022
Maybe I will let the
frogs get you.

11:13.057 --> 11:18.493
Yes, most tempting,
I'm sure, but terribly shortsighted.

11:18.529 --> 11:21.863
You've got that right!
Wait. Why?

11:21.899 --> 11:24.633
Do you think the
Incursians will be satisfied

11:24.668 --> 11:27.670
once they're rid of me and
they've conquered my homeworld?

11:27.705 --> 11:31.707
Other worlds have fallen.
More will fall.

11:31.743 --> 11:36.377
You want that on your
conscience, Ben Tennyson?

11:40.248 --> 11:42.683
It seems that there are
two ways down to the

11:42.718 --> 11:45.919
communications annex.
We can either descend dozens of

11:45.954 --> 11:49.923
ramps and staircases to reach it
or use the central express tube.

11:49.959 --> 11:53.426
The stairs are slow but safe.
The express tube is fast,

11:53.462 --> 11:57.897
<i>but to reach it, we must
cross the catwalk, exposed.</i>

11:57.932 --> 12:00.099
Okay. So what'll it be?

12:00.134 --> 12:03.703
Why do you ask me?
- Because you're in charge.

12:03.738 --> 12:08.107
I wonder what Ben would do?
- The catwalk?

12:08.143 --> 12:12.612
Then perhaps we should
take the stairs.

12:19.087 --> 12:23.823
He is right. Lower your
weapons or you will shoot Hobble!

12:23.858 --> 12:27.861
You understood that?
- Perfectly.

12:34.835 --> 12:38.738
Catwalk?
- Catwalk!

13:03.529 --> 13:06.597
Keep going!
We are almost there!

13:18.009 --> 13:22.644
Huh?

13:26.450 --> 13:29.217
<i>Bye-Bye.</i>

13:39.429 --> 13:41.061
What was that?

13:41.097 --> 13:44.298
The sound of your
friends getting blown to bits!

13:47.869 --> 13:53.140
Shut off the manacles.
We can fight them together.

13:55.611 --> 13:58.479
That's better.

13:58.514 --> 14:00.315
Hey!

14:11.794 --> 14:14.194
We'll catch up with Vilgax.

14:14.229 --> 14:18.832
First, I've got a score to
settle with Tennyson.

14:21.829 --> 14:24.897
I don't think we've met.
I'm Ben.

14:24.933 --> 14:27.567
Ow! Ow! Okay, okay!
Not friendly, got that.

14:27.602 --> 14:29.302
This is Eighteight.

14:29.337 --> 14:32.171
Any relation to Sixsix
or Sevenseven?

14:33.774 --> 14:36.441
'Cause there is a resemblance.

14:36.477 --> 14:37.742
No, no, no, no!
In a good way.

14:39.113 --> 14:42.948
Look, Attea, you don't
like Vilgax, I don't like Vilgax.

14:42.984 --> 14:45.784
Can't we work something out?

14:45.820 --> 14:50.173
I had to spend seventh grade

14:50.174 --> 14:54.527
in stasis jail because of you, so...

14:54.562 --> 14:57.063
Okay, okay.

15:02.236 --> 15:05.705
But that was only because
you tried to take over your father's empire.

15:05.741 --> 15:09.776
Ha! If you're trying to run,
you turned into the wrong species.

15:09.811 --> 15:13.279
Who said anything about running?

15:19.653 --> 15:22.855
Hey!
Whoa!

15:43.312 --> 15:47.114
Gee. That was close.

15:49.785 --> 15:50.818
Release me at once!

15:50.853 --> 15:54.555
Why? So you can throw me at
Attea and the bounty hunters again?

15:54.590 --> 15:58.092
No way.
- That was a diversion, fool.

15:58.127 --> 16:02.296
I knew you would defeat them
easily and rendezvous with me later.

16:02.331 --> 16:06.033
Comedy isn't real big on
your planet, is it?

16:06.068 --> 16:08.502
No.
What are you going to do?

16:08.537 --> 16:12.857
Hand me over to that arrogant Incursian?
- Like you said, tempting.

16:12.858 --> 16:16.535
But we're stuck with each
other till I can get you off

16:16.536 --> 16:20.213
of this rat trap and behind
bars someplace else. Let's go.

16:24.551 --> 16:26.819
Nobody here.
Guess we got lucky.

16:28.289 --> 16:31.657
<i>Guess again!</i>

16:33.527 --> 16:35.661
You four are in big trouble.

16:35.697 --> 16:37.863
Who do you think
you're talking to?

16:37.899 --> 16:41.267
The blackout field's still on, so
I know you didn't call for help.

16:41.302 --> 16:45.571
And, as I mentioned, Sixsix and
Sevenseven polished off your squad.

16:45.607 --> 16:47.740
<i>I beg to differ.</i>

16:54.381 --> 16:58.252
I hate you.
You said you saw them fry!

16:58.287 --> 17:02.456
Alas, appearances can
be deceiving.

17:13.336 --> 17:15.570
I will now swing us to safety.

17:16.874 --> 17:19.008
Hurry!

17:39.629 --> 17:42.464
Amateurs!
- Don't have an episode, Attea.

17:42.500 --> 17:45.367
You can hug it out after you're
all in the clink.

17:47.204 --> 17:50.539
Don't flatter yourself.

17:50.574 --> 17:53.375
Techadon dissipater.
- Is that dangerous?

17:53.410 --> 17:57.045
Only if it goes off.
- Insolent ape.

18:02.551 --> 18:07.788
N-o-o-o-o-o-o-o!

18:10.893 --> 18:13.694
Did you just do what
I think you just did?

18:14.797 --> 18:17.364
I don't know what came over me.

18:17.400 --> 18:22.070
That was the most glorious
act of heroism I've ever seen.

18:23.273 --> 18:25.407
Mutilate them!

18:29.212 --> 18:34.717
Rath. Give me Rath.
Please Rath!

18:34.752 --> 18:37.320
Gravattack?
I guess.

18:37.355 --> 18:42.091
<i>Hit the dirt!</i>

18:43.494 --> 18:46.896
How about we take this gravity
power of mine for a little spin?

19:18.761 --> 19:21.229
Dude!
Or dudette, I guess.

19:21.264 --> 19:27.576
Do you have any idea how many
G's I'm throwing at you?

19:35.611 --> 19:37.611
<i>Like, that many!</i>

19:37.646 --> 19:40.047
Now you can find the
communications room, shut

19:40.048 --> 19:42.449
down the blackout field,
and call Grandpa Max.

19:42.484 --> 19:45.886
Gladly.
Follow me, Plumbers.

19:45.921 --> 19:47.454
Wow. Nice work.

19:53.095 --> 19:55.228
You hang on to that.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.967
What do you know, Vilgax?

20:01.002 --> 20:02.735
First, you saved me,
and then I saved you.

20:02.771 --> 20:04.371
That isn't something you see every...

20:08.210 --> 20:14.314
And you won't see it again.

20:14.349 --> 20:16.984
Take it easy, son.
You're okay.

20:18.287 --> 20:19.687
I don't feel okay.

20:19.722 --> 20:21.656
Well, look at it like this.

20:21.691 --> 20:25.427
Rook got through to us, and you
didn't lose any members of your team.

20:25.462 --> 20:26.828
Yeah, but what about ...

20:26.863 --> 20:29.598
Attea and her bounty
hunters are missing.

20:29.633 --> 20:32.434
So is Vilgax.
- She got him?

20:32.470 --> 20:37.939
No.

20:45.648 --> 20:49.951
By the time Attea and
her pals came to, he was gone.

20:49.986 --> 20:52.788
No, wait, wait.
So they all got away?

20:52.823 --> 20:55.456
I can't believe how
bad I messed this up!

20:55.492 --> 20:58.560
It's okay, Ben.
You didn't "mess up."

20:58.595 --> 21:00.930
You did your best.

21:00.931 --> 21:03.265
<i>I really did!</i>

21:03.300 --> 21:07.491
That's too bad.
I would think the highest Commander

21:07.526 --> 21:10.972
of my celebrated Calaveras
legion would not choke in the field!

21:11.008 --> 21:14.143
Once word got out that Vilgax
got away from you, his home

21:14.178 --> 21:17.779
planet put up such a fight,
I had to retreat, which, as you

21:17.814 --> 21:22.550
might imagine, really
deleteriates my game plan.

21:22.585 --> 21:25.219
<i>I promise,
I'll make it up to you!</i>

21:25.255 --> 21:31.325
<i>You'd better,
or there will be real trouble.</i>

21:31.361 --> 21:35.729
You have no idea, old man.

21:46.810 --> 21:50.421
