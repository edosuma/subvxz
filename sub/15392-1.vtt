03:22.194 --> 03:23.153
How ya doin'?

03:29.201 --> 03:30.160
That's for you.

03:35.207 --> 03:37.167
- You sure you're up for this?
- Yeah.

03:40.212 --> 03:42.172
- So, see you tonight, right?
- Yeah.

03:46.218 --> 03:48.178
- Everything all right?
- Yeah.

03:50.180 --> 03:52.140
- So I'll see you tonight.
- OK.

04:02.192 --> 04:05.153
- What happened to you?
-What does it look like?

04:06.196 --> 04:07.155
I don't know.

04:09.199 --> 04:12.160
I had this pit bull, right?
Joe. Joe the dog.

04:14.204 --> 04:17.165
I go to feed the fuck, right?
I put his bowl down, he goes nuts.

04:18.208 --> 04:20.168
Bites my fucking thumb off.
19 stitches.

04:21.211 --> 04:23.171
I'm in the hospital three days.

04:25.215 --> 04:27.175
I get out. I get my gun.

04:28.218 --> 04:31.179
I go to him "You like to bite things?"
Bite this." I put the gun in his mouth.

04:33.181 --> 04:35.142
Bam! I blow him
all over the apartment.

04:35.183 --> 04:37.144
- Ever see a dog explode?
- They're here.

04:49.197 --> 04:52.159
This neighbourhood's a real shit hole.
I don't know why you had to meet here.

04:54.202 --> 04:57.164
We'll do the next meeting at
Tavern on the Green, all right?

05:00.208 --> 05:03.170
- How you doin', Noonan?
- I'm cold. Let's get this over with.

05:04.212 --> 05:06.173
- Fine. Let's see the stuff.
- Show 'em.

05:11.219 --> 05:14.181
- Let's see the money.
- We'll take this at a little discount.

05:15.182 --> 05:18.143
- I knew this shit was gonna happen.
- This is fucking bullshit.

05:19.186 --> 05:22.147
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me?

05:22.189 --> 05:24.149
- I'll shoot him.
- Don't point that at me.

05:24.191 --> 05:26.151
We'll walk away. This is bullshit.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.153
Give me the bag.
I want to shoot you.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.156
Shoot him.
I'll take this and get the fuck...

05:31.198 --> 05:34.159
Did you hear what I said?
I said give me the fucking bag.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.163
Don't be a fool.
Give me the bag. You want to die?

05:38.205 --> 05:40.165
- Shut up.
- Want me to shoot him?

05:40.207 --> 05:42.167
- I don't give a fuck.
- I'll shoot you now.

05:42.209 --> 05:44.169
Give me the fucking bag!

05:44.211 --> 05:46.171
- Let's go.
- Want to fucking get shot?

05:47.214 --> 05:49.174
Give me that fucking bag!

06:02.187 --> 06:05.148
- Jesus Christ...
- What happened back there?

06:05.190 --> 06:07.150
- What?
- Nothing, right?

06:07.192 --> 06:08.151
I don't... No! No!

06:09.194 --> 06:11.154
- Do you know me?
- No, I don't know ya!

06:11.196 --> 06:14.157
All right, put me
in a subway station. Go!

07:53.215 --> 07:56.176
He's wearing a silk suit.
He's got crocodile shoes.

07:56.218 --> 07:59.179
I said "I don't care what fucking shoes
you wear. You're still a crack dealer."

08:01.181 --> 08:04.142
The guy says "I didn't know
I was in your neighbourhood, man."

08:05.185 --> 08:07.145
Like his balls were in his throat.

08:07.187 --> 08:10.148
"Don't go to pieces" I tell him.
Then he gets the joke.

08:14.194 --> 08:17.155
- Who the fuck is this?
- What do you want?

08:17.197 --> 08:19.157
- Whatever you're having.
- Fuck you.

08:26.206 --> 08:29.167
Trying to hurt my feelings?
Won't introduce me to your friends?

08:31.211 --> 08:34.172
- Terry?
- That took you fucking long enough.

08:34.214 --> 08:35.173
Terry Noonan. Terry.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.176
- Terry Noonan.
- Hey, motherfucker.

08:39.219 --> 08:41.179
You fuckin'... Come here, come here.

08:43.181 --> 08:45.142
Where you fuckin' been, man? Oh, man.

08:50.188 --> 08:52.149
- It's great to fucking see ya.
- Hey.

08:53.191 --> 08:56.153
This is my best fucking friend.
See, I love this fucking guy.

08:58.196 --> 09:01.158
Where you been, fucking Mars?
You're looking good.

09:01.199 --> 09:03.160
I gotta take my lord here for a stroll.

09:03.201 --> 09:06.163
- I gotta talk to you.
- Wanna go somewhere?

09:06.204 --> 09:07.164
- Yeah.
- OK.

09:07.205 --> 09:09.166
Hey, catch you guys later, all right?

09:10.208 --> 09:12.169
Give me this, give me this.

09:13.211 --> 09:15.172
You're a fucking prick.

09:17.215 --> 09:20.177
Where'd our fucking neighbourhood go?
I don't even recognise the place.

09:23.180 --> 09:26.141
A bunch of yuppie condos.
They could've left ten blocks for the Irish.

09:27.184 --> 09:30.145
They don't even want to call it
Hell's Kitchen no more.

09:30.187 --> 09:33.148
Renamed it Clinton.
Sounds like a fucking steamboat.

09:41.198 --> 09:43.158
These guys you dropped.

09:45.202 --> 09:48.163
- The guy you were with, this...
- My partner? DeMarco.

09:50.207 --> 09:52.167
DeMarco? Can you trust him?

09:53.210 --> 09:56.171
He might as well have done it himself,
Jack. Who's he gonna tell?

09:57.214 --> 10:00.175
Who's he gonna tell?
Anybody he fucking wants.

10:01.218 --> 10:03.178
Terry, this guy, this DeMarco,

10:05.180 --> 10:08.141
he gets into a little trouble
with the cops, right?

10:08.183 --> 10:11.144
He'd trade everything he knows
about you for a slice of pizza.

10:12.187 --> 10:13.146
Wake up.

10:20.195 --> 10:23.156
Would you ask Mikey
if he'd throw me something?

10:24.199 --> 10:26.159
Mikey met with a little accident.

10:26.201 --> 10:29.162
So did Flynn.
Frankie's running the show now.

10:30.205 --> 10:33.166
- Frankie's the boss?
- My big brother is the boss.

10:33.208 --> 10:35.168
- Frank's the boss?
- Yeah.

10:37.212 --> 10:40.173
He's trying to put this deal together
with the Italians. This guy Borelli.

10:42.217 --> 10:44.177
- Joe Borelli?
- You heard of him?

10:45.220 --> 10:46.179
We're like that.

10:48.181 --> 10:51.143
- Hey, you want another beer?
- I'd love one.

11:01.194 --> 11:02.154
Cheers.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.159
Is your sister still around?

11:08.201 --> 11:10.162
No, Kate moved way the fuck uptown.

11:11.204 --> 11:13.165
- You wouldn't recognise her.
- Yeah?

11:16.209 --> 11:17.169
Terry.

11:19.212 --> 11:20.172
Check this out.

11:30.182 --> 11:32.142
- What the fuck is that?
- It's...

11:34.186 --> 11:37.147
It's Frankie's idea.
You got your favourite gun, right?

11:39.191 --> 11:42.152
He got tired of tossing away
a perfectly good piece after every job.

11:44.196 --> 11:45.155
You take your hands,

11:47.199 --> 11:49.159
and you take your gun.

11:50.202 --> 11:53.163
You put the prints on the gun,
you stash it.

11:55.207 --> 11:58.168
The cops find the gun.
They're lookin' for a dead man.

12:00.212 --> 12:02.172
- This is somebody's hands?!
- Yeah.

12:02.214 --> 12:05.175
- What are you touching 'em for?!
- Terry, meet Flynn.

12:06.218 --> 12:09.179
Don't fuck with me.
No, don't fuck with me.

12:10.180 --> 12:13.141
-- Don't! Don't! You're gonna get... Fuck!

12:14.184 --> 12:17.145
- That's somebody's hands!
- Are you scared?

12:20.190 --> 12:22.150
- Get the fuck...!
- All right, hands up.

12:22.192 --> 12:24.152
- Put 'em back.
- They're in. They're in.

12:26.196 --> 12:29.157
- They're in. All right?
- You're a sick pup.

12:29.199 --> 12:31.159
- I know.
- You're a very sick pup.

12:31.201 --> 12:33.161
What's this? Come here.

12:36.206 --> 12:37.165
Sweet.

12:38.208 --> 12:41.169
See this gun I got here?
I love this fucking gun.

12:44.214 --> 12:47.175
- I usually shoot straight when I'm drunk.
- You mean you were aiming?

12:52.180 --> 12:55.142
Thank God you're back. I was feeling like
the last fucking Irishman in the Kitchen.

12:59.187 --> 13:02.149
Terry, you've been away
too long. You gotta wake up.

13:02.190 --> 13:05.152
Never do business with a greaser.
The cops get him, they got an eyewitness.

13:07.195 --> 13:10.157
And an eyewitness puts you away.
Unless it's around here.

13:10.198 --> 13:12.159
The cops can't do shit around here.

13:14.202 --> 13:17.164
Now, me and Frankie took
this union guy out last year.

13:17.205 --> 13:20.167
Went up to him on the street,
popped his button.

13:20.208 --> 13:22.169
There must've been 50 witnesses.

13:23.211 --> 13:26.173
Cops were all over the Kitchen
asking questions.

13:26.214 --> 13:28.175
This one asshole raised his hand.

13:31.219 --> 13:34.181
Cops found his head spinning
inside a washer- dryer over on 47th.

13:36.183 --> 13:38.143
Haven't heard from the cops in a year.

13:38.185 --> 13:39.144
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:47.194 --> 13:49.154
- Jackie, where the hell were you?
- Kate.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.156
I waited for you. You said you'd come by.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.159
- When?
- You don't remember?

13:54.201 --> 13:57.162
- At my apartment.
- You shouldn't have moved so far away.

13:57.204 --> 14:00.165
She moved all the fucking way
uptown. Who can get there?

14:00.207 --> 14:03.168
Oh, right. You get above the 50s,
you get disoriented.

14:04.211 --> 14:05.170
Hello, Kathleen.

14:07.214 --> 14:10.175
- Well.
- It's Terry Noonan. He showed up.

14:12.219 --> 14:15.180
- Look what the cat dragged in.
- How are you?

14:16.181 --> 14:18.141
I thought you were...
Where did we think he was?

14:18.183 --> 14:19.142
Nobody knew.

14:22.187 --> 14:24.147
So, you got nostalgic for mayhem?

14:24.189 --> 14:25.148
Yeah, he just appeared.

14:25.190 --> 14:28.151
It's like angels were flying by,
so they dropped him off.

14:38.203 --> 14:40.163
- What?
- What do you mean, what?

14:41.206 --> 14:43.166
You've got this look. What's this look?

14:43.208 --> 14:45.168
Trying to remember how I feel about you.

14:45.210 --> 14:47.170
- That hard?
- Yeah, right.

14:48.213 --> 14:51.174
- I think I'm pissed.
- Yeah, you guys were, you know.

14:52.217 --> 14:53.176
Young. Very young.

14:56.179 --> 14:59.141
She cried a lot when you went away.
My poor little sister.

14:59.182 --> 15:02.144
She cried every night, praying
to the rosary you'd come back.

15:02.185 --> 15:05.147
- You broke her heart, Terry.
- You're an asshole, Jackie.

15:06.189 --> 15:08.150
- What did I do?
- I gotta go.

15:09.192 --> 15:11.153
Stay. Have some coffee.

15:11.194 --> 15:13.155
- You just got here.
- I gotta go to work.

15:13.196 --> 15:16.158
Come on. I never see you.
Just for a minute.

15:16.199 --> 15:19.161
- Terry asked about you.
- What did he want to know?

15:19.202 --> 15:21.163
She works up at the Regent Hotel.

15:22.205 --> 15:25.167
Ashtray in the lobby
costs more than my car.

15:25.208 --> 15:28.170
It's a supernatural event for her
to come down here amongst us.

15:30.213 --> 15:32.174
So, what was it I forgot?

15:32.215 --> 15:35.177
You said it would be no trouble
doing that favour I asked you.

15:36.219 --> 15:39.181
My car got hit by a cab.
I used up all my money to pay for it.

15:39.181 --> 15:42.142
- I have nothing to live on till payday.
- I can loan you right now.

15:44.186 --> 15:47.147
She likes our money,
but not the way we get it.

15:47.189 --> 15:49.149
Why don't you keep it?
Keep your money.

15:50.192 --> 15:53.153
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have said that.

15:54.196 --> 15:57.157
Sometimes my feelings get hurt too,
you know? The way you snub us.

15:59.201 --> 16:01.161
Take the money, Kathleen.

16:02.204 --> 16:05.165
- Come on, take it.
- All right. Thank you, Jackie.

16:05.207 --> 16:06.166
You're welcome.

16:11.213 --> 16:12.172
So, Terry.

16:15.217 --> 16:18.178
- You just passin' through?
- No. He's coming home.

16:21.181 --> 16:23.141
We're trying to work something out.

16:25.185 --> 16:28.146
If you get above the 40s,
maybe you'll run into me.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.149
It could happen. Right?

16:33.193 --> 16:36.154
- Be up to the angels, I guess.
- Them fucks.

16:37.197 --> 16:40.158
- Well, nice to see you... I guess.
- Same.

16:52.212 --> 16:55.173
My mother-in-law's got
a foot thing I gotta pay for.

16:55.215 --> 16:58.176
- She's got a foot thing.
- She's in the hospital.

16:58.218 --> 17:00.178
It isn't up to me, all right?

17:02.180 --> 17:04.141
Hey, Stevie! I got a surprise for you!

17:05.183 --> 17:07.144
Don't bother me. I'm negotiatin'.

17:08.185 --> 17:11.147
- Hey, negotiator!
- I don't believe this!

17:11.189 --> 17:12.148
Terry fuckin' Noonan!

17:14.192 --> 17:17.154
- Where the fuck have you been?
- Fuck, look at you.

17:17.194 --> 17:19.156
Scary Terry. What the fuck is this?

17:19.196 --> 17:22.159
- You go to the seminary? You don't write.
- He's bigger than me now.

17:24.202 --> 17:26.163
- It's been a long time.
- Ten years.

17:26.204 --> 17:28.165
- 12 years.
- We're doin' business.

17:28.205 --> 17:31.168
Hey, Stevie. 300 bucks here, Stevie.
It ain't even gonna cut it.

17:32.210 --> 17:35.172
- Where'd you find these two idiots?
- They come lookin' for me.

17:37.215 --> 17:40.177
They take my money. I work
my ass off for it and they take it.

17:40.218 --> 17:43.180
Listen. This punk owes
Jimmy Cavello eight grand.

17:43.180 --> 17:46.141
Cavello's got cuff links
cost more than that.

17:46.183 --> 17:49.144
Eight grand buys Jimmy
a Broadway ticket. Let's talk business.

17:50.187 --> 17:53.148
They're out of spumone,
you blame the waiter?

17:53.190 --> 17:56.151
What do we have, another mick
to contend with? What's going on?

17:56.193 --> 17:59.154
- You heard what I said.
- Where you fuckin' been?

17:59.196 --> 18:02.157
The last guinea around here was
Columbus. He only lasted a week.

18:03.200 --> 18:06.161
Are you some kind of fuckin' asshole,
or just taking lessons?

18:09.206 --> 18:10.165
Hey, I'll kill you!

18:25.180 --> 18:28.141
You want to fuck with me?
You want to do that?!

18:28.183 --> 18:31.144
What do you want to do, asshole?
Play it out? Let's straighten this out here.

18:32.187 --> 18:34.147
Tommy! Tommy, it's over!

18:36.191 --> 18:37.150
It's over, man!

18:42.197 --> 18:45.158
Cocksucker. Who do you think
you're fuckin' with, eh?

18:47.202 --> 18:50.163
You'll be hearing from
Jimmy Cavello, Stevie.

18:53.208 --> 18:56.169
Hope that was your favourite gun.
I hope you loved that gun.

18:57.212 --> 18:59.172
You don't know who you fucked with!

18:59.214 --> 19:00.173
You motherfucker.

19:02.217 --> 19:03.176
Fuck 'em.

19:04.219 --> 19:06.179
- You fuckin' guys.
- You got it all?

19:06.179 --> 19:09.141
You're better than the cavalry.
You saved me from the guineas.

19:10.183 --> 19:13.145
- They was gonna burn you at the stake.
- I'm glad you're back. I missed you.

19:15.188 --> 19:18.150
We'll take this town apart
on St Patty's Day.

19:18.191 --> 19:21.153
Stevie, there's a horse runnin'
called Old Friend Arrives.

19:23.196 --> 19:25.157
No shit. Look at this.

19:25.198 --> 19:27.159
You saved my ass,
now you'll win me money.

19:27.200 --> 19:30.162
I love ya. I gotta go.
OTB opens in ten minutes.

19:30.203 --> 19:33.165
- Hey, today's my lucky day.
- See ya later.

19:33.206 --> 19:36.168
Luckiest day he ever had,
his dog got run over.

19:36.209 --> 19:39.171
- Is he fucked up or is he fucked up?
- I wouldn't let him operate on me.

19:40.213 --> 19:42.174
You'd have to be dead two years first.

19:46.219 --> 19:49.181
I'm gonna call Frankie
about taking you on.

19:50.182 --> 19:53.143
We'll probably have to
go to Jersey to see him.

19:53.185 --> 19:55.145
Jersey? Frankie lives in Jersey?

19:56.188 --> 19:58.148
Yeah. What's the fuckin' world coming to?

20:19.211 --> 20:22.172
I want to have kids. I just gotta
find the right broad, like Frankie did.

20:23.215 --> 20:26.176
She'd let me fuck around on weekends,
and make pancakes before Sunday Mass.

20:28.220 --> 20:30.180
- Like Irene, maybe.
- Who's Irene?

20:30.180 --> 20:33.141
I spend one night with her, my eyes
are crossed for days. I walk into walls.

20:34.184 --> 20:36.144
- I'd like to meet her.
- She's mine.

20:36.186 --> 20:38.146
- Uncle Jackie!
- Hey.

20:39.189 --> 20:41.149
Hey, hey. Lola, come here.

20:42.192 --> 20:44.152
Look what the fuckin' cat dragged in.

20:45.195 --> 20:47.155
Nice to see you, Terry.
You remember Maureen?

20:47.197 --> 20:50.158
- How you doin'?
- Come on inside. We should talk.

20:51.201 --> 20:53.161
- I'm Pat.
- How you doin'?

20:53.203 --> 20:56.164
Play with the kids, OK, Jackie?
Teach 'em how to kneel or something.

20:57.207 --> 20:59.167
 You want to see my gun, hm?

21:11.179 --> 21:14.141
Before you began exploiting these
pathetic skanks' addictive personalities,

21:15.183 --> 21:18.145
- Where were you?
- A lot of different places.

21:20.188 --> 21:21.148
Tell me about one.

21:23.191 --> 21:24.151
- Texas.
- No shit?

21:26.194 --> 21:29.156
I did my bit with the Corps.
Worked an oiI rig for a while.

21:30.198 --> 21:33.160
Spent a couple of years driving
heavy machinery in Oklahoma.

21:35.203 --> 21:37.164
Even rode a jackhammer in Milwaukee.

21:41.209 --> 21:43.170
You picked some very odd fuckin' places.

21:47.215 --> 21:49.176
- No time in the slam, huh?
- No.

21:51.219 --> 21:52.179
You're lucky.

21:57.184 --> 22:00.145
I gotta say, when you was a kid,
I never took you for a shooter.

22:04.191 --> 22:07.152
You weren't somebody I'd expect to drop
two guys, like I hear you did in the Bronx.

22:09.196 --> 22:11.156
I'll do a good job for you. Take me on.

22:12.199 --> 22:13.158
We'll see.

22:15.202 --> 22:17.162
You wouldn't regret it.

22:25.212 --> 22:28.173
- What do I have to do?
- It's gonna be a hoot, man.

22:34.221 --> 22:35.180
Check him out, Pat.

22:36.181 --> 22:39.142
Find this DeMarco guy
Jackie says is the hit.

22:40.185 --> 22:43.146
If things check out,
relocate DeMarco in a dumpster.

22:44.189 --> 22:47.150
Noonan's with us, I don't want the cops to
look at us for drug bullshit from the Bronx.

23:16.179 --> 23:19.141
This is how me and Frankie deal with
guys tearing apart the neighbourhood.

23:20.183 --> 23:23.145
Easier than sending a telegram.
Don't cost as much.

23:29.192 --> 23:32.154
These guys get rich evicting
the real people who live here.

23:32.195 --> 23:35.157
They kick out the Irish
to build yuppie nests.

23:39.202 --> 23:42.164
Yuppies gotta be thicker
than the rats and the roaches.

23:44.207 --> 23:46.168
Assholes can't live without their dogs.

23:47.210 --> 23:50.172
Got dog shit all over the sidewalk.
It never used to be that way.

23:51.214 --> 23:54.176
Used to be, you dropped a cone,
you could pick it up and finish it.

23:56.219 --> 23:59.181
People wander the streets homeless
cos of these assholes.

24:03.185 --> 24:06.146
- So we're like Robin Hood here.
- Yeah. And I'm Friar Fuck.

24:09.191 --> 24:12.152
- What the fuck you doin'?
- 100-yard dash.

24:13.195 --> 24:15.155
- 100-yard dash?
- Yeah.

24:16.198 --> 24:19.159
Are you fuckin' crazy?
You'll blow up the whole place.

24:22.204 --> 24:25.165
I'll only do it if you really want to, Terry.

24:30.212 --> 24:33.173
All right. All right, you fuckin' asshole.

24:33.215 --> 24:34.174
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:34.216 --> 24:35.175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:36.218 --> 24:37.177
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.179
OK.

24:41.181 --> 24:42.140
One.

24:45.185 --> 24:46.144
Two.

24:47.187 --> 24:48.146
Three!

25:12.212 --> 25:14.172
Neighbourhood, one! Yuppies, zero!

25:19.219 --> 25:20.178
Come on.

26:09.186 --> 26:10.145
Bartender. Guinness.

26:13.190 --> 26:15.150
I want you to meet Irene, man.

26:17.194 --> 26:20.155
- Irene.
- Pleased to meet ya, Terry Noonan.

26:21.198 --> 26:24.159
What you two boys been doin'?
Playing with matches?

26:24.201 --> 26:27.162
- Tell you later, OK?
- You can tell me all night.

26:27.204 --> 26:28.163
It's a long story.

26:29.206 --> 26:30.165
What you gonna do?

26:33.210 --> 26:36.171
- Maybe I'll come back.
- Yeah, the hell you will.

26:37.214 --> 26:39.174
Jackie, what the fuck are you doin'?

26:39.216 --> 26:41.176
- Get the fuck off me!
- Rock 'n' roll!

26:42.219 --> 26:45.180
- Look what you did.
- See you later, Terry.

27:23.218 --> 27:26.179
- Have a good flight.
- Thank you very much.

27:27.180 --> 27:28.140
Hi.

27:29.182 --> 27:30.142
You mind I'm here?

27:33.186 --> 27:35.147
No. No, but it's busy.

27:36.189 --> 27:37.149
What possessed you?

27:39.192 --> 27:41.153
Listen, I have a break in an hour.

27:43.196 --> 27:45.157
- Meet you here?
- Sure.

27:46.199 --> 27:47.159
- Or outside?
- Here's OK.

27:47.200 --> 27:49.161
- Outside's better.
- OK.

27:53.206 --> 27:54.166
I love your uniform.

28:00.213 --> 28:03.175
Is this your dinner break?
You wanna go eat?

28:03.216 --> 28:05.177
Yeah, we could.
I'm not hungry, really.

28:07.220 --> 28:09.181
Frankie's kids are cute.

28:09.181 --> 28:12.142
His wife looks great next to him in court.

28:12.184 --> 28:15.145
They're some Laura Ashley
suburban mutation.

28:15.187 --> 28:17.147
He commutes,
she drives a station wagon.

28:26.198 --> 28:27.157
So what are we doin'?

28:31.203 --> 28:32.162
I wanted to see you.

28:33.205 --> 28:34.164
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

28:35.207 --> 28:37.167
Where's Jackie? Did he stand you up?

28:38.210 --> 28:39.169
He ran into Irene.

28:41.213 --> 28:42.172
What a slut.

28:45.217 --> 28:47.177
So how come you don't have a boyfriend?

28:48.220 --> 28:50.180
I do have a boyfriend. He's out of town.

28:51.181 --> 28:53.141
I met him at the hotel. He travels a lot.

28:58.188 --> 29:00.148
I'm lying. I recently broke up.

29:07.197 --> 29:09.157
- I'm divorced.
- Divorced? Really?

29:12.202 --> 29:13.161
Any kids? I hope not.

29:14.204 --> 29:16.164
Six months ago. Yeah, no kids.

29:23.213 --> 29:26.174
- Let's go dancing.
- Don't you want dinner?

29:26.216 --> 29:29.177
- Don't you have to go back?
- I got somebody.

29:29.219 --> 29:32.180
I called the girl who works the other shift.
I begged her. We can do that.

29:38.186 --> 29:40.147
You want to go dancing with me?

29:43.191 --> 29:46.153
Come on, Terry. No one forgets
their first love. You know that.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.160
Just the slow ones?

29:57.205 --> 29:58.165
Just the slow ones.

29:58.206 --> 30:00.167
 Well, you tell us that we're wrong

30:06.214 --> 30:08.175
You tell us not to sing our song

30:14.181 --> 30:16.141
Nothing we can say will make you see

30:21.188 --> 30:24.149
You got a heart of stone
you can never feel

30:28.195 --> 30:31.156
You say: oh, I'm not afraid,
it can't happen to me

31:04.189 --> 31:06.149
- Yeah?
- DeMarco. Buick's out front.

31:08.193 --> 31:11.154
- Point him out.
- You gotta be kidding me, man.

31:20.205 --> 31:22.165
In the corner. At the table.

31:23.208 --> 31:24.167
Just wanted change.

31:35.220 --> 31:37.180
I understand you knew a Terry Noonan.

31:39.182 --> 31:41.143
Get out of my face. I don't know no one.

31:41.184 --> 31:44.146
- What's this?
- We're gonna go for a little walk.

31:45.188 --> 31:47.149
- What are you, a cop?
- Yeah.

31:47.190 --> 31:49.151
- Let's go.
- I don't know no one.

31:50.193 --> 31:51.153
- Come on.
- I don't!

31:57.200 --> 32:00.162
- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. Terry, it's me, Jackie.

32:01.204 --> 32:03.165
Frankie wants us on the job.

32:09.212 --> 32:11.173
Now? It's two in the morning, man.

32:12.215 --> 32:14.176
This is one of Frankie's peak hours.

32:50.212 --> 32:53.173
- How are you, Mr Raferty?
- I'm fine, Stevie.

32:57.219 --> 32:59.179
I got you five cases of Bushmills.

33:01.181 --> 33:04.142
Nobody drinks it, Flannery.
It costs too much.

33:04.184 --> 33:07.145
I'm selling it cheap. 900 bucks for
all five cases. I'm doing you a favour.

33:09.189 --> 33:12.150
Mikey McDonnell ran
the same scam on me for 500.

33:12.192 --> 33:15.153
Might be the reason
Mikey didn't leave nothing in his will.

33:20.200 --> 33:23.161
I ain't paying for any
goddamn Bushmills I don't need.

33:24.204 --> 33:26.164
Jackie, check out the bar.

33:26.206 --> 33:29.167
- See what this gentleman needs.
- Sure thing, Frank.

34:01.199 --> 34:04.161
Stevie, what are you doing
with these bums?

34:05.203 --> 34:08.165
Stevie, are you gonna let
this dickhead insult us like that?

34:09.206 --> 34:12.168
Looks like they're low. Bar got crowded
tomorrow, it'd go dry in an hour.

34:20.217 --> 34:23.179
Ain't givin' you a fuckin' cent, Flannery.

34:32.188 --> 34:35.150
What are you doing?
It's like beating up your grandfather.

34:35.192 --> 34:37.152
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut the fuck up.

34:37.194 --> 34:40.155
- Don't tell me to shut up.
- Fuck you. You shut the fuck up.

34:41.197 --> 34:44.159
- I won't tell you again! Shut up!
- The man's 50 years old!

34:44.201 --> 34:46.161
- Shut up!
- You shut up!

34:46.203 --> 34:48.163
- Fuck you!
- Stevie, shut up!

34:48.205 --> 34:51.166
- You ain't my fuckin' father!
- Hey, Stevie!

34:52.208 --> 34:54.168
Hey, Pat! Fuck you! Shut up!

34:55.212 --> 34:58.173
- I want your opinion, I'll dial your asshole.
- Nicholson's the asshole.

35:01.218 --> 35:03.178
What the fuck is goin' on here?!

35:04.221 --> 35:07.182
- Terry! Get outta here!
- What's the matter, tough guy?

35:11.186 --> 35:12.145
Get outta here!

35:15.190 --> 35:16.149
Get outta here!

35:18.193 --> 35:21.154
Pat, you do what I'm telling you!
Get outta here!

35:23.198 --> 35:26.159
The bunch of you,
get the fuck outta here!

35:26.201 --> 35:27.160
Get outta here!

35:38.213 --> 35:40.173
I want the balance in two days, Raferty,

35:40.215 --> 35:43.176
or you can scratch your name
out of the Yellow Pages.

35:46.179 --> 35:49.141
- What the fuck were you doin'?
- He hit Stevie.

35:49.182 --> 35:52.144
I know he hit him. He was supposed to.
He acted like an asshole.

35:52.185 --> 35:55.147
Why do we have to
beat the shit out of an old man?

35:55.188 --> 35:57.149
To scare him, you clown.

35:57.190 --> 35:59.151
He was scared. He was already scared.

35:59.192 --> 36:01.153
We're trying to intimidate this dickhead.

36:02.195 --> 36:05.157
Then we're in a self-inflicted brawl
acting like a bunch of cowboys.

36:05.198 --> 36:07.159
The one thing Borelli don't want!

36:09.202 --> 36:11.163
He'll piss on us if he thinks
we lost our manners.

36:11.204 --> 36:13.165
Frankie, I was fuckin' proud of ya.

36:14.207 --> 36:17.169
Acting like yourself for a change,
jumping in there. Not like a greaseball.

36:18.211 --> 36:21.173
You check with Borelli before you shit.
I don't know who you are half the time.

36:22.215 --> 36:24.176
- Fuck you.
- I'm sorry if I love you.

36:25.218 --> 36:27.179
- You're my brother.
- You're a curse.

36:27.220 --> 36:30.182
- I've taken care of you my whole life.
- You were doin' a good job of it, too.

36:38.190 --> 36:40.150
You fuck me up again,
the whip comes down.

36:40.192 --> 36:43.153
- You got that? You understand me?
- Yeah.

37:04.216 --> 37:05.175
- Who is it?
- Terry.

37:19.189 --> 37:20.148
What's the matter?

37:37.207 --> 37:38.166
Terry, what is it?

39:46.211 --> 39:49.172
Now, Frankie, if we're gonna work
together, I got a little problem.

39:51.216 --> 39:53.176
Somehow I got to solve it.

39:53.218 --> 39:55.178
Is it something I could
help you with, Mr Borelli?

39:55.220 --> 39:58.181
Stevie McGuire.
Lives in your neighbourhood.

39:58.181 --> 40:00.142
- You know him?
- Yeah, I know him.

40:01.184 --> 40:03.145
It's true. He runs some errands for me.

40:04.187 --> 40:07.149
It's also true he owes
Jimmy here eight grand.

40:08.191 --> 40:11.153
Now, eight grand's not a lot of money.
I got guys out there owe me 80.

40:12.195 --> 40:15.157
Except I know I'm gonna
get it back from them.

40:15.198 --> 40:18.160
It's really not the eight grand
that's got Jimmy and me upset here.

40:19.202 --> 40:21.163
It's this McGuire kid's attitude.

40:23.206 --> 40:25.167
Jimmy here goes asking for our money,

40:25.208 --> 40:28.170
and this McGuire kid, he spills
a drink on Jimmy's new cashmere.

40:30.213 --> 40:31.173
Did it deliberately.

40:33.216 --> 40:35.177
This is what Jimmy tells me.

40:35.218 --> 40:37.179
Now Jimmy can't get the stain out.

40:37.220 --> 40:40.182
He's been to six fucking cleaners,
and the best they could do was fade it.

40:43.185 --> 40:46.146
This kid just doesn't have
any respect for Jimmy here.

40:46.188 --> 40:49.149
And if he's got no respect for Jimmy,
he's got no respect for me.

40:52.194 --> 40:55.155
Frankie, the most important thing
in doing business is good manners.

40:57.199 --> 41:00.160
And I really don't think it would be proper

41:00.202 --> 41:03.163
for us to have to go into your
neighbourhood to solve our problem.

41:05.207 --> 41:06.166
Understand?

41:19.221 --> 41:21.181
Frankie, don't make a mess.

41:25.185 --> 41:27.145
You kids from the Westside.

41:33.193 --> 41:36.154
(Stevie) I'm not a connoisseur,
but I know my wine.

41:37.197 --> 41:40.158
I know my way around if I'm at a table.
Not just by the names.

41:42.202 --> 41:44.162
- How you doin', Stevie?
- Hi, Pat.

41:46.206 --> 41:49.167
- We gotta talk.
- Not tonight, Pat, all right?

41:49.209 --> 41:52.170
I'm right in the middle of
telling her my life story.

41:52.212 --> 41:55.173
Yeah, well, it won't take long. I promise.

41:56.216 --> 41:58.176
I gotta step outside. I'll be right back.

41:58.218 --> 42:00.178
Cindy, right? Sandy. I'm sorry.

42:14.192 --> 42:15.152
What's goin' on, Pat?

42:16.194 --> 42:19.156
The eight grand you owe Jimmy Cavello.
Should have quit at two.

42:19.197 --> 42:22.159
Cavello? What have you
got to do with Cavello?

42:23.201 --> 42:25.162
How you doin', Stevie?

42:25.203 --> 42:28.165
You won't cut me over eight grand
don't even belong to you.

42:28.206 --> 42:30.167
It ain't my habit to cut people up.

42:33.211 --> 42:35.172
I've been working on the eight grand.

42:35.213 --> 42:38.175
I've been chipping away at it. Let me
make a phone call. I'll check on it.

42:39.217 --> 42:42.179
You should've made it yesterday,
Stevie. Rent's overdue.

42:45.182 --> 42:47.142
Frankie, it's me, all right?

42:48.185 --> 42:50.145
We grew up together. We're friends.

42:50.187 --> 42:53.148
Don't give me that bullshit.
My friends don't owe money.

42:58.195 --> 43:01.156
You fuck! Fuck you, Frankie,
you motherfucker!

43:02.199 --> 43:04.159
 Fuck you. You son of a bitch!

43:07.204 --> 43:09.164
Get the fuck off me!
Get the fuck off me!

43:11.208 --> 43:14.169
- Give me the knife. Got the knife?
- Yeah. Here.

43:14.211 --> 43:17.172
You shouldn't have fuckin' said that,
Stevie. I was gonna let Pat do this.

43:19.216 --> 43:22.177
Pat's the expert.
Me, I'm just an amateur.

43:41.196 --> 43:43.156
You did better than
you thought you would.

43:43.198 --> 43:44.157
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

44:03.218 --> 44:06.179
Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.

44:06.179 --> 44:09.141
 Where the fuck are you?
Terry. Kathleen. Stevie's dead.

44:11.184 --> 44:14.146
- Stevie's fuckin' dead.
- Jack? Jack, where are you?

44:38.211 --> 44:40.172
Aw, look what they fuckin' did!

44:49.181 --> 44:51.141
- Kate.
- Hello, Frankie.

44:51.183 --> 44:53.143
- What are you doin'?
- Frankie! Frank!

44:54.186 --> 44:55.145
You see this, man?!

44:57.189 --> 45:00.150
- You see this?
- What are you doin' here, Kathleen?

45:00.192 --> 45:03.153
Oh, Jesus! They cut his throat, the fucks!

45:04.196 --> 45:07.157
- You shouldn't have brought Kathleen.
- I want to go.

45:07.199 --> 45:10.160
- Kathleen, I'd like to buy you breakfast.
- I gotta go.

45:11.203 --> 45:14.164
Whoever did it, the fucker doesn't
get his cappuccino in the morning.

45:15.207 --> 45:17.167
And I do it. I fuckin' whack him out!

45:18.210 --> 45:21.171
- Don't you jump to conclusions.
- Hey! Hey, Terry!

45:21.213 --> 45:22.172
I'll be right back.

45:25.217 --> 45:28.178
- What did Frankie say?
- Stevie never hurt nobody.

45:30.180 --> 45:33.141
I hurt people. Frankie hurts people.
Stevie borrowed money, that's all.

45:34.184 --> 45:36.144
Who'd kill him over fuckin' money?!

45:36.186 --> 45:39.147
You act surprised? Are you serious?
This surprises you?

45:40.190 --> 45:43.151
Every time you turn around
somebody's dead.

45:43.193 --> 45:45.153
- What?
- How many wakes did we go to as kids

45:45.195 --> 45:47.155
because somebody forgot to pay money?

45:47.197 --> 45:50.158
Every time we turn around
somebody's dead, huh? Bullshit!

45:52.202 --> 45:53.161
Hey! See?

45:54.204 --> 45:55.163
Hey! See?

45:59.209 --> 46:01.169
Stevie never hurt nobody!
Fuck you!

46:03.213 --> 46:06.174
You'll hunt him down. You three
will conduct an investigation

46:07.217 --> 46:10.178
untiI you find somebody
who maybe did this.

46:10.220 --> 46:13.181
I'm glad I saw this. I was forgetting
how you are, how you think.

46:13.181 --> 46:16.143
- It's crazy of me to be near any of you.
- Let me straighten it out.

46:17.185 --> 46:20.147
I shouldn't be seeing you.
Can we stop? Let's just stop.

46:20.188 --> 46:23.150
- Don't do this.
- I'm not gonna get caught... No!

46:23.191 --> 46:26.153
I won't get caught in this any more.
I'm not falling back.

46:27.195 --> 46:28.155
What about me? Huh?

46:30.198 --> 46:32.159
What about me? Hold on.

46:32.200 --> 46:34.161
- Let's go.
- No, hold on!

46:34.202 --> 46:35.162
Here.

46:35.203 --> 46:36.163
What about me?

46:37.205 --> 46:40.167
All right, fuck it. I'll call you.
I'll fuckin' call.

46:48.216 --> 46:51.178
- Let's go. I gotta go somewhere.
- Where?

46:51.219 --> 46:54.181
Remember Mickey Cassidy? His sister
didn't wear panties to dance class?

46:55.182 --> 46:58.143
He's dead too. He was
dumb enough to become a cop.

46:59.186 --> 47:01.146
I gotta go to the funeral.
It's over in Queens.

47:01.188 --> 47:04.149
- I can't stand driving in Queens.
- You want me to drive?

47:05.192 --> 47:07.152
No. Then I'd have to look out the window.

47:30.217 --> 47:32.177
Ain't gonna be like this when we go.

47:33.220 --> 47:36.181
Probably paste shamrocks on our
foreheads, drop us next to an expressway.

47:38.183 --> 47:41.144
And two years later,
build a fuckin' mall on top of us.

47:41.186 --> 47:44.147
People walking all over us
to get a fuckin' milkshake.

48:14.219 --> 48:17.180
I'm feeling squirrelly, man.
All this fuckin' marching music.

48:21.184 --> 48:22.144
I want a drink.

48:32.195 --> 48:34.156
- What do you want?
- Heineken.

48:34.197 --> 48:35.157
Two Heineken.

48:44.207 --> 48:45.167
Cassidy's old man.

48:51.214 --> 48:53.175
Better go pay my respects. You coming?

48:54.217 --> 48:55.177
Go ahead.

48:59.181 --> 49:00.140
A couple of Buds.

49:03.185 --> 49:05.145
I'm Jackie Flannery. I knew Mickey.

49:09.191 --> 49:12.152
Ain't smart, marching in a parade.
You're supposed to be dead.

49:13.195 --> 49:16.156
If DeMarco were here,
he'd think he was seeing ghosts.

49:16.198 --> 49:17.157
DeMarco is a ghost.

49:18.200 --> 49:21.161
Somebody left him in a dumpster
in his favourite neighbourhood.

49:22.204 --> 49:23.163
Call me.

49:31.213 --> 49:33.173
I gotta get outta here.

49:35.217 --> 49:37.177
I feel like I'm on Mars.

49:38.220 --> 49:39.179
I feel surrounded.

49:52.192 --> 49:55.153
- The guineas did Stevie, didn't they?
- Stevie owed everybody.

50:01.201 --> 50:02.160
-
- Hey.

50:10.210 --> 50:12.170
- All right. You ready?
- Yeah.

50:25.183 --> 50:28.145
This Stevie McGuire they found floating
in the East River, he's part of this?

50:30.188 --> 50:33.150
-Cavello did it.
- Could Flannery have been involved?

50:37.195 --> 50:40.157
He didn't hit one of his own
for no reason.

50:40.198 --> 50:43.160
- Money's always a reason.
- He didn't owe Frankie money.

50:44.202 --> 50:47.164
As a favour, to impress Borelli.
Stevie ain't wrapped in a ribbon,

50:48.206 --> 50:51.168
but Borelli's sense of
self- importance is soothed

50:52.210 --> 50:55.172
that this goofball ain't
walking the streets no more.

50:56.214 --> 50:59.176
You gotta get me outta this.
I'm gonna get caught up in this shit.

51:00.218 --> 51:03.180
- What?
- I don't know what I'm doing here.

51:03.180 --> 51:05.140
- You're a cop.
- These guys are my pals.

51:06.183 --> 51:09.144
You smell like a distillery. You drink
too much. How much are you drinking?

51:10.187 --> 51:13.148
Just listen to me.
Please fuckin' listen to me.

51:15.192 --> 51:18.153
- You gotta get me outta this.
- I gotta get you outta this?

51:18.195 --> 51:20.155
- You're talking like my grandma.
- Fuck!

51:24.201 --> 51:27.162
I'm drinking too much. You're right.
Jackie's my friend. My best fuckin' friend.

51:30.207 --> 51:33.168
I thought I could walk in
and do this, but I can't.

51:34.211 --> 51:37.172
- It'll get outta control.
- It's a bullshit attack of feelings.

51:37.214 --> 51:39.174
Just surgically remove the fuckers.

51:39.216 --> 51:42.177
Get on with putting these
scumbags off the street.

51:42.219 --> 51:45.180
You think I went to Boston to be a cop
cos I hated Boston crooks so much?

51:46.181 --> 51:49.142
No, to get away. To get as far away as
I could so that this could never happen.

51:52.187 --> 51:55.148
I'd never be in such circumstances
where I'd have to arrest my own friends!

51:56.191 --> 51:58.151
These animals are your friends?

51:59.194 --> 52:02.155
Hey, what do you know about it?
I don't know you.

52:02.197 --> 52:05.158
Where are you from?
Poughkeepsie? White Plains?

52:05.200 --> 52:08.161
- Stop drinking, Noonan.
- That's what I'm saying, you fuckin' idiot!

52:11.206 --> 52:14.167
That's all they do is drink.
I'm Irish muscle in these circumstances.

52:16.211 --> 52:18.171
We drink, we shoot people,
and I'll get caught in it.

52:18.213 --> 52:21.174
I'm warning you,
I gotta go back to Boston.

52:21.216 --> 52:23.176
You're talking like an asshole.

52:23.218 --> 52:26.179
I'll run the fuck away,
where none of you can find me.

52:26.179 --> 52:29.141
Jesus Christ, I thought you
Kitchen guys were tough guys.

52:29.182 --> 52:31.143
We're not tough, Nick!

52:34.187 --> 52:36.148
- Just crazy.
- You ain't either.

52:36.189 --> 52:38.150
You're a fuckin' crybaby.

52:50.203 --> 52:51.163
Oh, God.

52:54.207 --> 52:56.168
You gotta get something on Flannery.

52:57.210 --> 52:58.170
Hey. Come on.

52:59.212 --> 53:01.173
You gotta get something on Flannery.

53:02.215 --> 53:05.177
You gotta see something
we can accuse him of.

53:07.220 --> 53:10.182
You can get on the witness stand and say
"Him. Fuck him. Put him away."

53:14.186 --> 53:15.145
It ain't gonna work.

53:17.189 --> 53:20.150
Borelli and Flannery make that deal,
people will drop dead all over the city.

53:23.195 --> 53:25.155
If that happens, Noonan,

53:27.199 --> 53:29.159
the blood's on your hands.

53:38.210 --> 53:41.171
It's a difficult situation.
We're here, they're there in their world.

53:42.214 --> 53:45.175
Looks like Borelli's
gonna let us in. Now this.

53:45.217 --> 53:48.178
- How'd you find out?
- People saw him take Stevie to the car.

53:48.220 --> 53:50.180
Cavello was there. They all drove away.

53:50.180 --> 53:53.141
- They think they can do this to us.
- I know that.

53:54.184 --> 53:57.145
They don't respect us.
Cavello's head has gotta roll.

53:57.187 --> 54:00.148
Yes, but first we're gonna show some
maturity. Can you show me maturity?

54:02.192 --> 54:05.153
- I'm talking about the neighbourhood.
- I'm talking about I am your boss.

54:08.198 --> 54:11.159
Borelli says nobody gets hit.
We don't have his permission.

54:14.204 --> 54:17.165
The neighbourhood's disappearing
in a tide of yuppies and dog shit.

54:19.209 --> 54:22.170
Borelli's our ticket
so we can retire to Phoenix.

54:24.214 --> 54:27.175
Cavello keeps gettin' up in the morning
till I say different. You got that?

54:29.219 --> 54:32.180
Or you want me to put it
in writing on your forehead?

54:34.182 --> 54:35.142
Jack?

54:38.186 --> 54:39.146
Jack?

54:40.188 --> 54:42.149
You listening to me, Jackie?

54:58.206 --> 55:00.167
- Stop it!
- Terry, Terry, wait. Hold it.

55:03.211 --> 55:05.172
Jackie, stop it!
He wasn't doin' nothing!

55:06.214 --> 55:08.175
Hey, whoa, Jack. Jackie!

55:09.217 --> 55:11.178
You fuckin' maniac! Fuckin' maniac!

55:16.183 --> 55:18.143
You're crazy, you know that?

55:23.190 --> 55:25.150
It's all right. Let him go.

55:27.194 --> 55:29.154
- You OK, huh?
- You all right?

55:32.199 --> 55:33.158
Broads, huh?

55:34.201 --> 55:37.162
They put a wire around your dick
and lead you around like Dodo the dog.

55:38.205 --> 55:40.165
You gotta marry 'em to forget 'em.

55:40.207 --> 55:42.167
Don't worry about Jackie.

55:42.209 --> 55:45.170
Sit down. Sit down a minute, Terry.
I want to talk to you.

55:50.217 --> 55:52.177
So, you like Kate, huh?

55:52.219 --> 55:54.179
- You've been seeing her.
- Yeah.

55:57.182 --> 55:59.142
You gotta trust me on this one.

56:00.185 --> 56:03.146
It's a crime, but she holds people
like you and me in nothin' but contempt.

56:05.190 --> 56:08.151
You heard of ice queens? My sister Kate
has moved a Frigidaire inside herself.

56:13.198 --> 56:16.159
I'm just tryin' to let you
learn from my experience.

56:16.201 --> 56:19.162
If she thinks I'm shit,
what will she make of you?

56:19.204 --> 56:22.165
Don't you think we ought to
be worried about Jackie?

56:23.208 --> 56:26.169
Yeah, you're right. Keep an eye on Jackie.

56:26.211 --> 56:28.171
Keep him out of trouble.

56:29.214 --> 56:31.174
I'm countin' on you, Terry.

56:36.179 --> 56:37.139
Pat.

56:40.183 --> 56:42.144
- Something wrong?
- I don't know.

56:43.186 --> 56:46.148
When you're not too busy,
keep an eye on Noonan for me.

56:46.189 --> 56:47.149
Love to.

57:06.209 --> 57:08.170
- Who is it?
- Kate, it's Terry.

57:10.213 --> 57:13.175
I'm sorry I'm here,
but Jackie's disappeared.

57:13.216 --> 57:16.178
I looked everywhere. I can't find him.
You got any idea where he might be?

57:41.203 --> 57:42.162
Jack.

57:46.208 --> 57:49.169
I'd offer you a beer, Kate,
except I drank all of it.

57:53.215 --> 57:54.174
You know...

57:55.217 --> 57:56.176
we'd come here...

57:59.221 --> 58:00.180
But not now.

58:01.181 --> 58:04.142
I thought about Stevie
as hard as I could.

58:07.187 --> 58:09.147
I hope that he's praying.

58:11.191 --> 58:13.151
I should've known to look for you here.

58:18.198 --> 58:21.159
Do you remember Stevie used to
come here... and hide with us?

58:23.203 --> 58:26.164
Nobody'd ever think we'd come in here
without a nun dragging us in by the ear.

58:30.210 --> 58:32.170
Like Father whatshisface.
Remember him?

58:33.213 --> 58:36.174
He had too much spit, so he foamed
at the mouth when he gave the sermon.

58:49.187 --> 58:50.147
 We were kids.

59:02.200 --> 59:04.161
 It's peaceful here, right.

59:10.208 --> 59:12.169
Look at all the saints.

59:13.211 --> 59:16.173
There's St Anthony and St Francis.
Who's that one over there?

59:20.218 --> 59:21.178
Hey.

59:26.183 --> 59:28.143
Let's go see St Anthony.

59:29.186 --> 59:31.146
Maybe he wants a drink.

59:50.207 --> 59:51.166
 Jackie!

59:55.212 --> 59:57.172
I don't think he wants a drink, Jack.

59:58.215 --> 59:59.174
No.

01:00:01.218 --> 01:00:02.177
- He's a teetotaller.

01:00:04.221 --> 01:00:05.180
I'm sorry.

01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:27.160
- Jackie.
- Jack, come on.

01:00:28.203 --> 01:00:30.163
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

01:00:33.208 --> 01:00:35.168
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint!

01:00:38.213 --> 01:00:40.173
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

01:00:54.187 --> 01:00:57.149
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.
I'm gonna make Stevie a saint.

01:02:58.186 --> 01:03:00.147
- Come on. What...?
- You want some?

01:03:01.189 --> 01:03:04.151
No, I don't want some.
Terry, stop it! What are you doin'?!

01:03:05.193 --> 01:03:07.154
What are you doin'? Terry, stop it!

01:03:13.201 --> 01:03:14.161
What are you doin'?

01:03:17.205 --> 01:03:19.166
- Come here.
- I'm a cop!

01:03:22.210 --> 01:03:24.171
I'm a cop. I'm a fuckin' Judas cop!

01:03:51.198 --> 01:03:53.158
- Terry...
- I gotta go.

01:04:00.207 --> 01:04:02.167
- Terry...
- I gotta go.

01:04:03.210 --> 01:04:05.170
- What are you sayin'?
- I don't know.

01:04:05.212 --> 01:04:07.172
What are you talking about?

01:04:10.217 --> 01:04:12.177
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:04:33.198 --> 01:04:34.157
Uh-uh.

01:04:35.200 --> 01:04:38.161
- What's wrong? Your stomach upset?
- It's hard to get up in the morning.

01:04:39.204 --> 01:04:41.164
It's like pulling my socks over my shoes.

01:04:41.206 --> 01:04:43.166
- Yeah?
- Like I'm in this fuckin' fog.

01:04:47.212 --> 01:04:49.172
Terry, you're missing the point here.

01:04:50.215 --> 01:04:53.176
I can't remember shit.
That's the way I like it.

01:04:53.218 --> 01:04:55.178
Only hint of a problem is,
I need a little Maalox.

01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:56.179
But I can buy Maalox.

01:05:00.183 --> 01:05:03.145
- You always were tougher than me.
- I always thought I was just crazier.

01:05:26.168 --> 01:05:28.128
You take Finn. He's easy.

01:05:29.129 --> 01:05:30.088
What's his marker?

01:05:31.131 --> 01:05:34.092
700 and change,
which he ain't gonna have.

01:05:34.134 --> 01:05:37.095
Just look him in the eye.
Scare the fuck out of him.

01:05:37.137 --> 01:05:39.097
My guy, however, is in the upper bracket.

01:05:41.141 --> 01:05:44.102
He got righteous last time.
Refused to open the door.

01:06:07.167 --> 01:06:09.127
 Hey. I got no money today.

01:06:12.130 --> 01:06:14.091
You still gotta open up.

01:06:15.133 --> 01:06:18.095
I'm an old man, and I'm eatin'
stewed tomatoes out of a can.

01:06:20.138 --> 01:06:22.099
-- Do you hear my axe? That's my axe.

01:06:24.142 --> 01:06:27.104
Don't break that door. I gotta have a door.

01:06:27.145 --> 01:06:29.106
- Then open it.
- All right. Wait.

01:06:44.162 --> 01:06:47.124
You got anything at all? Five, ten dollars?
They'd think better of you.

01:06:48.166 --> 01:06:51.128
You're Terry Noonan.
You're Eddie Noonan's boy.

01:06:52.170 --> 01:06:54.131
Oh, my God. I played cards with your dad.

01:06:57.134 --> 01:07:00.095
And he showed me pictures
of you all the time.

01:07:01.138 --> 01:07:02.097
Lord God.

01:07:03.140 --> 01:07:06.101
If he had lived to see that
you was workin' for the Flannerys,

01:07:07.144 --> 01:07:09.104
he'd have whipped your ass.

01:07:09.146 --> 01:07:11.106
Oh, he was a great man. A great...

01:07:11.148 --> 01:07:14.109
When he wasn't drunk or daydreaming
about some bullshit history he never had,

01:07:16.153 --> 01:07:19.114
he was beating me or pissing
out the window thinking it was a can.

01:07:25.162 --> 01:07:28.123
You want to give a history lesson,
get your facts straight.

01:07:30.167 --> 01:07:33.128
I'll tell 'em you're eatin'
stewed tomatoes, OK?

01:07:33.170 --> 01:07:36.131
You're cocky, but can I
tell you something?

01:07:36.131 --> 01:07:39.092
Them Flannerys are black snakes,
and they move in the dark of the night,

01:07:41.136 --> 01:07:43.096
and they always turn on everybody.

01:07:46.141 --> 01:07:47.100
I ain't worried.

01:07:48.143 --> 01:07:51.104
That McGuire boy, you know,
he wasn't worried neither,

01:07:52.147 --> 01:07:55.108
untiI they led him out of
Matty's Bar like a prize pig.

01:08:01.156 --> 01:08:03.116
I'm old, but I can still see.

01:08:04.159 --> 01:08:06.119
You saw Stevie led out of Matty's Bar?

01:08:07.162 --> 01:08:10.123
- Clear as the nose on your face.
- Who led him out?

01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:13.126
It's, uh...

01:08:14.169 --> 01:08:17.130
- You know, your people.
- It was a Flannery.

01:08:17.130 --> 01:08:19.091
Was it Frankie? Huh? Was it Frankie?

01:08:20.133 --> 01:08:22.094
If you hit me, you'll fry in hell,
cos your dad...

01:08:22.135 --> 01:08:25.096
Who did you see?
Was it Frank? Who'd you see?

01:08:26.139 --> 01:08:28.100
I swear I didn't see nothin'.

01:08:28.140 --> 01:08:30.102
I saw nothin', I did nothin'. I'm just...

01:08:30.143 --> 01:08:33.104
I'm here eating stewed tomatoes
out of a can.

01:08:44.157 --> 01:08:47.118
Ain't nobody gonna hit you
for your money. OK?

01:08:52.165 --> 01:08:53.125
Oh, God.

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:03.093
How'd it go?

01:09:05.136 --> 01:09:08.098
I didn't even knock.
I just took down the door.

01:09:08.140 --> 01:09:10.100
It was a beautiful door. A McAndrews.

01:09:12.144 --> 01:09:15.104
I caught him off guard by the element
of surprise. Decides he wants to tumble.

01:09:17.149 --> 01:09:20.109
So we're throwing punches.
You should have seen it.

01:09:20.152 --> 01:09:23.113
We're rolling around on the fuckin'
linoleum. His old lady hollering.

01:09:26.158 --> 01:09:28.118
He's a big fuck, so he thinks he's got me.

01:09:28.160 --> 01:09:31.121
I think he's got me.
Then I bite into his fuckin' ear.

01:09:32.163 --> 01:09:35.125
That stopped the whole thing
in 0.2 seconds.

01:09:36.167 --> 01:09:39.129
- So, what are you up for?
- I feel like goin' home.

01:09:41.131 --> 01:09:42.090
Yeah? Where's that?

01:09:53.143 --> 01:09:55.103
-  Call ya later.
- Yeah.

01:10:25.133 --> 01:10:26.093
I'm closed.

01:10:28.136 --> 01:10:30.097
Who led Stevie McGuire
out of here that night?

01:10:30.138 --> 01:10:32.099
- I don't know him.
- You don't know him?

01:10:34.142 --> 01:10:36.103
Red-haired guy? Everybody knows Stevie.

01:10:37.145 --> 01:10:38.105
I told ya, I don't know him.

01:10:38.146 --> 01:10:40.107
-  What's he doin'?
- I don't know.

01:10:41.149 --> 01:10:44.111
He could be tryin' to find out
about Stevie. He liked that kid.

01:10:45.153 --> 01:10:47.114
He could just be havin' a drink.

01:10:48.156 --> 01:10:51.118
This fucker's gettin' too complicated.
Let's simplify things.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:55.122
Take care of the bartender, then
we take a close look at Noonan.

01:10:55.163 --> 01:10:56.123
Right.

01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:04.131
- Can I use your men's room?
- It's in the back.

01:11:10.137 --> 01:11:13.098
Somebody slit my pal's throat
the other night.

01:11:15.142 --> 01:11:18.103
- You gonna tell me who that was?
- Big guy.

01:11:18.145 --> 01:11:21.106
- What's his name?
- Jesus, don't do this.

01:11:21.148 --> 01:11:24.109
Nobody's doin' nothin' to nobody.
It's all just happening, see?

01:11:25.152 --> 01:11:28.113
Guy who hangs out with Frankie
Flannery. He walked him out.

01:11:37.164 --> 01:11:38.123
- Nicholson.
- I don't know him.

01:11:38.165 --> 01:11:40.125
Well, that's his name.

01:12:30.133 --> 01:12:32.094
- Ten minutes.
- Fine. Thank you.

01:12:52.155 --> 01:12:55.117
- Hi, Kathleen.
- Frankie, what are you doing?

01:12:55.158 --> 01:12:57.119
I gotta talk to you.
Can you find me a minute?

01:12:57.160 --> 01:12:59.121
Yeah. Give me five minutes.

01:13:00.163 --> 01:13:03.125
Tell you what. Meet you in the bar
over there. Straight ahead.

01:13:03.166 --> 01:13:06.128
- Where's the bar?
- Right through there and to your right.

01:13:07.170 --> 01:13:09.131
- Don't keep me waiting.
- I won't.

01:13:24.146 --> 01:13:25.105
Sit down.

01:13:31.153 --> 01:13:33.113
I ordered you a white wine.

01:13:37.159 --> 01:13:39.119
What is it you want, Frankie?

01:13:39.161 --> 01:13:42.122
I don't gotta want something
all the time, do I?

01:13:42.164 --> 01:13:44.124
I never knew you when you didn't.

01:13:46.168 --> 01:13:48.128
Who took care of you
when you was a kid?

01:13:48.170 --> 01:13:51.131
When guys hit on you, who took care
of you? Who went looking for them?

01:13:53.133 --> 01:13:56.094
That's why I moved up here-so nice men
could hit on me and not fear for their life.

01:13:57.137 --> 01:14:00.098
They fly to Europe.
That don't make 'em nice.

01:14:03.143 --> 01:14:05.103
I don't know what happened between us.

01:14:06.146 --> 01:14:09.107
It's kind of like you never
even wanted to know me.

01:14:10.150 --> 01:14:13.111
If you feel rejected, Frankie,
it's because I do. I reject you.

01:14:16.156 --> 01:14:17.115
You're so cold.

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:21.119
What happened to you?

01:14:22.162 --> 01:14:25.123
What happened to that sweet little girl,
her heart was shining through her skin?

01:14:28.168 --> 01:14:31.129
People say that when they can't make you
do what they want - "You're so cold."

01:14:33.131 --> 01:14:36.093
The way you treat me,
I ought to box your ears.

01:14:36.134 --> 01:14:38.095
- I have to go back to work.
- Sit down.

01:14:39.137 --> 01:14:42.099
Sit down for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

01:14:43.141 --> 01:14:45.102
I want to talk to you
about Terry Noonan.

01:14:46.144 --> 01:14:49.106
He's coming to work for me in my
organisation. I think he'll do very well.

01:14:51.149 --> 01:14:54.111
But, in the Bronx two weeks ago, you'd
be so surprised to know what he did.

01:14:56.154 --> 01:14:59.116
He got tangled up in this drug deal
with these lowlifes.

01:14:59.157 --> 01:15:02.119
He killed both of 'em.
He shot 'em point-blank.

01:15:04.162 --> 01:15:07.124
So he ain't what
you're looking for, is he, Kate?

01:15:14.131 --> 01:15:17.092
You came all the way
across town to tell me that?

01:15:17.134 --> 01:15:20.095
I thought that you should know it,
that's all.

01:15:52.169 --> 01:15:54.129
- Yeah?
- It's Kathleen.

01:15:59.134 --> 01:16:01.094
I have to talk to you.

01:16:01.136 --> 01:16:04.097
You should've called.
These halls are dangerous.

01:16:04.139 --> 01:16:07.100
It was hopeless. I had to see you.
My mind set its own agenda. So here I am.

01:16:09.144 --> 01:16:12.105
- What time is it?
- It was three when I left the house.

01:16:14.149 --> 01:16:17.110
- You want a drink?
- I've had two Valium already.

01:16:18.153 --> 01:16:21.114
My mind's just... spinning
with everything, you know?

01:16:22.157 --> 01:16:23.116
Sit down.

01:16:27.162 --> 01:16:30.123
I mean... Frankie told me
you're working for him.

01:16:30.165 --> 01:16:32.125
- Why'd he do that?
- What do you mean, why?!

01:16:32.167 --> 01:16:33.126
Because I got away!

01:16:35.170 --> 01:16:38.131
You tell me you're a cop and he tells me
you killed two drug dealers in the Bronx.

01:16:39.132 --> 01:16:41.093
No, that was a setup. They were cops.

01:16:42.135 --> 01:16:44.096
- You killed two cops?
- It wasn't real. I had blanks.

01:16:44.137 --> 01:16:46.098
They went down, gave me credentials...

01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:50.102
- I don't know about this.
- You're asking me.

01:16:50.143 --> 01:16:52.104
- I thought you were different.
- I am. I'm a cop!

01:16:52.145 --> 01:16:55.107
They're my brothers
and you're gonna put 'em in jaiI!

01:16:55.148 --> 01:16:58.110
- You're jumping all over the place.
- I'm not jumping all over the place.

01:17:00.153 --> 01:17:03.115
My brother comes to me and he...
he's telling me he trusts you,

01:17:04.157 --> 01:17:07.119
and I have this knowledge that you're a...

01:17:08.161 --> 01:17:11.123
- When I told Linda everything...
- Who's Linda?

01:17:11.164 --> 01:17:13.125
My shrink. I had a double session today.

01:17:14.167 --> 01:17:17.129
You told your shrink?
You told your shrink about me?

01:17:18.130 --> 01:17:20.090
- Of course I told her!
- Wait a minute.

01:17:20.132 --> 01:17:23.093
There's some shrink out there
who knows I'm a cop?

01:17:23.135 --> 01:17:26.096
- That's right. I have a shrink.
- Fuck me!

01:17:26.138 --> 01:17:29.099
I tell her what happens in my life. I have
a right to try and straighten out my life!

01:17:31.143 --> 01:17:33.103
- You could get me killed!
- Oh, shit.

01:17:35.147 --> 01:17:37.107
I thought I was out of this.

01:17:37.149 --> 01:17:40.110
I thought I'd gotten away.
It's like some trick.

01:17:40.152 --> 01:17:43.113
I don't know how I ended up here
but you gotta help me.

01:17:44.156 --> 01:17:45.115
I can't leave town. I have a job.

01:17:45.157 --> 01:17:48.118
And I can't move any further uptown...
or I'll be in fucking Harlem!

01:17:50.162 --> 01:17:53.123
That's what I came here to tell you.
Just stay away from me.

01:17:54.166 --> 01:17:57.127
- That's not why you're here.
- Yeah, it is.

01:17:57.169 --> 01:17:58.128
- No.
- Yes, it is.

01:17:59.129 --> 01:18:02.090
People don't come to a place like this
in the night to tell someone to stay away.

01:18:03.133 --> 01:18:05.093
- Terry, don't.
- Kathleen, it's OK.

01:18:06.136 --> 01:18:07.095
- Don't.
- It's OK.

01:18:10.140 --> 01:18:11.099
It's OK.

01:18:27.157 --> 01:18:29.117
No. Get off of me. Get off of me!

01:18:31.161 --> 01:18:34.122
I don't want anything to do with you!
Stay away from me!

01:18:35.165 --> 01:18:38.126
You're just like my fuckin' brothers!
You are!

01:18:38.168 --> 01:18:41.129
You think you can come to me
whenever you fuckin' want,

01:18:41.129 --> 01:18:44.091
and you just reach inside me
and you just... you just pull!

01:18:45.133 --> 01:18:47.094
- You can't!
- I love you.

01:18:47.135 --> 01:18:50.097
You're a liar. I've met you before.
You're a fuckin' liar! You shut up!

01:19:13.161 --> 01:19:16.123
You ask these fucks for a cappuccino
or a cannoli, their eyes cross.

01:19:19.167 --> 01:19:22.129
Corned beef and cabbage.
Give us a green pitcher of beer.

01:19:28.135 --> 01:19:29.094
Give me a pitcher.

01:19:32.139 --> 01:19:35.100
- These fucks come here often?
- I don't know.

01:19:40.147 --> 01:19:43.108
How many times I gotta tell you?
That's Frankie.

01:19:43.150 --> 01:19:46.111
I'm trying to tell you something.
This is Jackie.

01:19:46.153 --> 01:19:49.114
I see this kid all the time
on Tenth Avenue. It's Frankie.

01:19:49.156 --> 01:19:52.117
I'll go down. I'll settle it. I'll talk to him.

01:19:52.159 --> 01:19:55.120
Yeah, ask him to come over here
and have a drink.

01:20:02.169 --> 01:20:05.130
We're arguing whether
you're a Flannery or not.

01:20:05.130 --> 01:20:08.091
You are, right? You're not Frankie,
you're the other one, right?

01:20:10.135 --> 01:20:11.094
No, I'm not Frankie.

01:20:12.137 --> 01:20:14.097
You see that guy over there?

01:20:15.140 --> 01:20:16.099
That's Jimmy Cavello.

01:20:17.142 --> 01:20:19.102
Jimmy says let bygones be bygones.

01:20:19.144 --> 01:20:22.105
He wants you to come over
and join us for a drink.

01:20:24.149 --> 01:20:26.109
Get him a pitcher of anything he wants.

01:20:26.151 --> 01:20:29.112
Come on, join us. You hungry?
You want something to eat?

01:20:30.155 --> 01:20:31.114
No.

01:20:38.163 --> 01:20:39.122
Pull up a chair, kid.

01:20:59.142 --> 01:21:00.102
Fuck it.

01:21:41.143 --> 01:21:44.104
- Everybody get the fuck out.
- What's up?

01:21:44.146 --> 01:21:45.105
Get out!

01:21:47.149 --> 01:21:49.109
You're a piece of work, Jackie.

01:21:50.152 --> 01:21:53.113
- They come into our neighbourhood...
- Who am I? Who the fuck am I?!

01:21:54.156 --> 01:21:57.117
I am your boss! But you hurt me.
You try to help me, you fuckin' hurt me!

01:21:58.160 --> 01:22:01.121
He whacks out Stevie
and thinks I would drink with him.

01:22:01.163 --> 01:22:04.124
We're talking about discipline,
maturity. This is what I get?!

01:22:05.167 --> 01:22:08.128
- He shouldn't have sent his goon to me.
- Tell me one thing! Am I a joke to you?

01:22:10.130 --> 01:22:12.090
Is that how you see me?

01:22:13.133 --> 01:22:16.094
I don't want this shithead sittin' in
our neighbourhood like the fuckin' pope!

01:22:18.138 --> 01:22:21.099
- You know what you did?
- Paid Stevie back.

01:22:21.141 --> 01:22:23.101
No, you maybe started a fuckin' war.

01:22:23.143 --> 01:22:26.104
Two steps away from a deal and money
like the lottery, you fuck it up. For what?

01:22:28.148 --> 01:22:31.109
Stevie! A jerk-off kid who insults
the world by not paying what he owes.

01:22:33.153 --> 01:22:36.114
- Frankie!
- Can't you see I'm busy here?!

01:22:36.156 --> 01:22:39.117
- Want me to rip the phone off the wall?
- It's Borelli. Somebody for Borelli.

01:22:42.162 --> 01:22:44.122
- What's he want?
- Shut up.

01:22:48.168 --> 01:22:49.127
Yeah. Yeah.

01:22:58.136 --> 01:22:59.096
Yeah.

01:23:01.139 --> 01:23:02.099
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:23:05.143 --> 01:23:07.104
He wants a sit-down. Me and him.

01:23:10.148 --> 01:23:11.108
When?

01:23:13.151 --> 01:23:16.113
- Get me a pot of coffee.
- How many cups?

01:23:16.154 --> 01:23:17.114
One.

01:23:23.161 --> 01:23:25.122
You send everybody home.

01:23:25.163 --> 01:23:27.124
But they are by their phones.

01:23:28.166 --> 01:23:31.128
They don't leave their phones
to go to the can

01:23:31.169 --> 01:23:33.130
they can't hear the phone ringing.

01:23:37.134 --> 01:23:40.095
I want you outside the door.
See that I am not disturbed.

01:23:41.138 --> 01:23:42.097
Right.

01:23:52.149 --> 01:23:54.109
- What about me?
- You go home.

01:23:56.153 --> 01:23:57.112
You sit by the phone.

01:23:59.156 --> 01:24:00.115
Can you do that?

01:24:03.160 --> 01:24:06.121
- What are you gonna do?
- I got some thinkin' to do.

01:24:06.163 --> 01:24:08.123
I gotta figure this thing out.

01:24:10.167 --> 01:24:12.127
I gotta have some privacy
to sit and think

01:24:12.169 --> 01:24:15.130
and figure how I'm gonna
handle this thing.

01:24:50.165 --> 01:24:52.125
- Yeah?
- Hey, Terry. It's me, Jackie.

01:24:54.169 --> 01:24:56.129
- Yeah, Jackie.
- Got a little job.

01:24:57.130 --> 01:25:00.092
Meet me at 43rd and Broadway.
About 11 o'clock, all right?

01:25:03.136 --> 01:25:05.097
- Can you get there?
- I'll be there.

01:25:05.138 --> 01:25:06.098
All right. See ya.

01:25:31.164 --> 01:25:32.124
(phone rings)

01:25:35.168 --> 01:25:38.130
Hi. Please
leave a message after the beep.

01:25:38.130 --> 01:25:40.090
 Hey, it's me. You there?

01:25:41.133 --> 01:25:42.092
Hello? Hello?

01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:50.100
Will you pick up if you're there?

01:25:53.145 --> 01:25:56.106
Look, we're in the middle of this thing.
You gotta understand.

01:25:56.148 --> 01:25:59.109
And I'm sorry. If I hurt you,
I'm sorry, all right?

01:26:01.153 --> 01:26:03.113
I'll get back. Good night.

01:26:25.135 --> 01:26:26.094
Hey, Terry.

01:26:34.144 --> 01:26:36.104
Where are we going? Beirut?

01:26:36.146 --> 01:26:39.107
Borelli's phoned Frankie.
We gotta come to this meeting.

01:26:41.151 --> 01:26:44.112
Cavello got wasted in the Kitchen
in the wee hours of the morning.

01:26:45.155 --> 01:26:46.114
- Cavello?
- Yeah.

01:26:47.157 --> 01:26:48.116
Is nobody safe?

01:27:01.129 --> 01:27:04.091
- You got the address?
- Yeah, right here.

01:27:04.132 --> 01:27:06.093
Get on down there now, OK? Get situated.

01:27:06.134 --> 01:27:09.096
It's just up from the restaurant.
Everything arranged.

01:27:09.137 --> 01:27:12.099
I arrive at noon. I don't call you
by two o'clock or Pat don't call you,

01:27:14.142 --> 01:27:17.104
you come in, tear 'em apart,
the spaghetti still on their spoons.

01:27:20.148 --> 01:27:22.109
You OK, Noonan?
Everything OK with you?

01:27:23.151 --> 01:27:26.113
- It'll be all right, Frankie.
- Yeah, either we're dead or we ain't.

01:27:34.162 --> 01:27:36.123
Anybody know how to get to Mott Street?

01:27:38.166 --> 01:27:39.126
Damn.

01:28:24.129 --> 01:28:25.088
Terry.

01:29:07.130 --> 01:29:10.092
...fold like a futon,
and the fuckin' frame's bent, right?

01:29:11.134 --> 01:29:14.096
So I bring it home. It looks easy.
I can't put the fuckin' thing together.

01:29:15.138 --> 01:29:18.100
So we called in a neighbour,
a guy with a very nice fuckin'...

01:29:20.143 --> 01:29:22.104
Let's get down to business.

01:29:22.145 --> 01:29:25.107
First of all, this problem we got here.
This is your responsibility.

01:29:28.151 --> 01:29:31.113
Either you get the respect
of your own people, or you got nothin'.

01:29:32.155 --> 01:29:35.117
My people, I let them go
at this thing on their own,

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:40.122
your brother, he'd be in so many
fuckin' pieces right now,

01:29:40.163 --> 01:29:43.125
you couldn't put him back together
again even if you had directions.

01:29:45.168 --> 01:29:46.128
But I said no.

01:29:47.170 --> 01:29:50.132
I said Frankie Flannery is a man who
knows when things have to be set right,

01:29:51.133 --> 01:29:54.094
and that you'd never let your feelings
get in the way of a big business decision.

01:29:56.138 --> 01:29:59.099
Now, what I told my people,
Frankie... was wrong?

01:30:14.156 --> 01:30:17.117
Of course, this is
a matter of some complexity.

01:30:17.159 --> 01:30:20.120
But if you won't solve this problem,
I'm gonna have it solved for you.

01:30:23.165 --> 01:30:25.125
You understand that? Huh?

01:30:31.131 --> 01:30:34.092
You don't have to
worry about Frankie, man.

01:30:34.134 --> 01:30:37.095
And if he ain't OK, there'll be
a dumpster full of dead guineas,

01:30:38.138 --> 01:30:40.098
spaghetti still on their forks.

01:30:56.156 --> 01:30:57.115
Look...

01:30:59.159 --> 01:31:01.119
I could straighten the kid out.

01:31:02.162 --> 01:31:05.123
Jimmy Cavello was a great guy.
We all know this.

01:31:07.167 --> 01:31:08.126
But the kid...

01:31:12.130 --> 01:31:13.090
The kid...

01:31:15.133 --> 01:31:18.095
You should've been there
when I reamed him out over this.

01:31:18.136 --> 01:31:21.098
He'd have crawled in a hole
and brought the hole in with him,

01:31:21.139 --> 01:31:23.100
if he could find a hole to go into.

01:31:23.141 --> 01:31:26.103
Don't embarrass yourself, Frankie.
I know you don't want to insult me.

01:31:29.147 --> 01:31:30.107
No.

01:31:30.148 --> 01:31:33.110
But to be frivolous on a matter
of such importance is an insult.

01:31:35.153 --> 01:31:37.114
This fuckin' bum is your brother.

01:31:37.155 --> 01:31:40.117
So I understand your need to pursue
some hopeless course to try to save him.

01:31:42.160 --> 01:31:45.122
But everybody knows
what's gotta happen here.

01:31:46.164 --> 01:31:49.126
With every heartbeat, his miserable
fuckin' douche-bag life insults me.

01:31:55.132 --> 01:31:57.092
He's a thorn in my side, Frankie.

01:31:59.136 --> 01:32:02.097
Since we're together,
he's a thorn in your side.

01:32:04.141 --> 01:32:05.100
Now look, Frankie.

01:32:07.144 --> 01:32:09.104
I gotta know, and I gotta know now.

01:32:13.150 --> 01:32:16.111
Are you gonna be able to
pull this thorn out of our side?

01:32:26.163 --> 01:32:27.122
All right.

01:32:28.165 --> 01:32:30.125
This is your brother, Frank.

01:32:32.169 --> 01:32:35.130
So, for the sake of family and blood,
I'm gonna give you this opportunity.

01:33:18.131 --> 01:33:21.093
Looks like it's time
to kick some guinea ass.

01:33:22.135 --> 01:33:24.096
But he didn't call yet, Jackie.

01:33:25.138 --> 01:33:28.100
He said we don't go
untiI he called or Pat called.

01:33:29.142 --> 01:33:32.104
- That ain't what he said.
- Course it was. I was right there.

01:33:33.146 --> 01:33:35.107
- Richie, what'd he say?
- Who?

01:33:36.149 --> 01:33:38.110
- Frankie!
- About what?

01:33:38.151 --> 01:33:41.113
What are you askin' him for?
He's fuckin' stupid.

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:49.121
Now, let's have some dessert.

01:33:53.166 --> 01:33:56.128
- I gotta make a call.
- Let the business wait.

01:33:57.170 --> 01:33:59.131
- Enjoy your dessert.
- It's my wife.

01:33:59.131 --> 01:34:01.091
Don't offend me, Frankie.

01:34:01.133 --> 01:34:04.094
You're gonna get up from my table
to call your wife?

01:34:06.138 --> 01:34:07.097
Let her wait.

01:34:12.144 --> 01:34:14.104
Don't fuck him up again.

01:34:14.146 --> 01:34:16.106
- That ain't what he said.
- It is what he said.

01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:19.109
- He said if he didn't call.
- No, if he did call.

01:34:20.152 --> 01:34:22.112
If we said... He said if we didn't call.

01:34:23.155 --> 01:34:25.115
- If he did.
- If he didn't.

01:34:25.157 --> 01:34:26.116
Did. Jack...

01:34:26.158 --> 01:34:29.119
I was in the truck.
He said if he didn't call.

01:34:29.161 --> 01:34:31.121
- No.
- If we didn't fuckin' call.

01:34:31.163 --> 01:34:34.124
- Where was I?!
- You were there too! You're fuckin' deaf!

01:34:35.167 --> 01:34:38.128
- He said if he didn't call.
- He said if he did call.

01:34:38.170 --> 01:34:39.129
- Relax.
- Richie.

01:34:41.131 --> 01:34:43.091
- I didn't hear him.
- He's fuckin' retarded!

01:34:43.133 --> 01:34:45.093
Nothing personal, Richard. You're stupid.

01:34:46.136 --> 01:34:48.096
That's not what he said.

01:34:50.140 --> 01:34:52.100
Jack, he said if he did call.

01:34:53.143 --> 01:34:55.103
If he called, we go. Otherwise no.

01:34:59.149 --> 01:35:01.109
Have a piece of cheesecake.

01:35:11.161 --> 01:35:13.121
Fuck me, man. This don't feel right.

01:35:14.164 --> 01:35:15.123
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

01:35:24.132 --> 01:35:25.092
Jack, calm down.

01:35:30.138 --> 01:35:33.100
-  Whoo!
- Jackie, Jackie, Jackie. Listen.

01:35:33.141 --> 01:35:36.103
He said if he did call...
Relax. Will you relax?

01:35:36.144 --> 01:35:39.106
- Terry, I love you, but you're wrong.
- I love you too, and I'm right.

01:35:40.148 --> 01:35:42.109
- He could be dying. Let's go.
- Jack...

01:35:43.151 --> 01:35:44.111
Let's go, huh?!

01:35:46.154 --> 01:35:49.116
You want me to make that call
for you, Mr Flannery?

01:35:49.157 --> 01:35:52.119
Tell your boy to stop
movin' around so much.

01:35:53.161 --> 01:35:55.122
He's interfering with my digestion.

01:36:01.169 --> 01:36:03.130
Have a cannoli. Some anisette.

01:36:08.135 --> 01:36:09.094
Just fucking go!

01:36:18.145 --> 01:36:19.104
 Let's go. Come on.

01:36:22.149 --> 01:36:24.109
I'm coming. I'm ready. All right.

01:36:30.157 --> 01:36:32.117
- You want your clock?
- No.

01:36:33.160 --> 01:36:35.120
Big mistake. Big mistake.

01:36:44.129 --> 01:36:47.090
Mr Borelli, I really do
gotta make a phone call.

01:36:47.132 --> 01:36:50.093
I must make it.
My wife's not been feeling well.

01:36:55.140 --> 01:36:56.099
With your permission.

01:36:59.144 --> 01:37:00.103
Go. Make your call.

01:37:01.146 --> 01:37:02.105
Thank you.

01:37:52.155 --> 01:37:54.116
See? She ain't even home.

01:38:08.130 --> 01:38:11.091
Either they forgot about us or
this entire neighbourhood better duck.

01:38:31.153 --> 01:38:34.114
All right. I want you to
drop me off at 39th Street.

01:38:36.158 --> 01:38:38.118
He ain't there! Frankie ain't there!

01:38:48.170 --> 01:38:50.130
Frank! It ain't a hit! It ain't a hit!

01:38:53.133 --> 01:38:55.093
- Let's get out of here!
- Move it!

01:38:57.137 --> 01:39:00.098
- It's all right.
- He was talking to him.

01:39:00.140 --> 01:39:01.099
I know. Turn around.

01:39:02.142 --> 01:39:03.101
What's this?

01:39:04.144 --> 01:39:07.105
Frankie, I hope you're not
lookin' to start a war here.

01:39:08.148 --> 01:39:10.108
In a war, we would crush you.

01:39:10.150 --> 01:39:11.109
You understand?

01:39:16.156 --> 01:39:19.117
Hey. Dumb fucks.
Don't know how close they came.

01:39:20.160 --> 01:39:21.119
It's your brother.

01:39:22.162 --> 01:39:24.122
My heart goes out to you.

01:39:40.138 --> 01:39:43.100
 What happened, apparently,
is that Borelli's got this beef with Cavello.

01:39:45.143 --> 01:39:48.105
Cavello failed to get permission
from Borelli to take out Stevie,

01:39:49.147 --> 01:39:51.108
which pissed Borelli off
cos of this thing with us.

01:39:51.149 --> 01:39:54.111
And there was probably some
other secretive guinea bullshit too.

01:39:56.154 --> 01:39:58.115
So... he don't give a shit about Cavello.

01:39:59.157 --> 01:40:00.117
No.

01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:05.122
And as a kind of bonus
he's sendin' over 25 grand.

01:40:05.163 --> 01:40:08.125
All we gotta do is drop a couple of
Haitians who are on his drug turf.

01:40:10.168 --> 01:40:12.129
He's sendin' over
the first instalment tonight.

01:40:12.170 --> 01:40:14.131
- You wanna pick it up?
- Sure.

01:40:16.133 --> 01:40:17.092
Good.

01:40:20.137 --> 01:40:22.097
It's unbelievable, huh?

01:40:23.140 --> 01:40:25.100
The way things turn out.

01:40:28.145 --> 01:40:29.104
Yeah.

01:40:33.150 --> 01:40:36.111
I gotta catch a shower, and some fresh
clothes. I've been in this shit for days.

01:40:39.156 --> 01:40:42.117
The pick-up's at 11.
I'll let you know where.

01:40:43.160 --> 01:40:46.121
I want to keep this hush-hush, OK?
Just you and me. It's a lot of money.

01:40:47.164 --> 01:40:50.125
St Patty's is coming up, so we'll have
a little loose change to celebrate with.

01:40:54.129 --> 01:40:55.088
Hey, Jack.

01:40:59.134 --> 01:41:00.093
Come here.

01:41:14.149 --> 01:41:16.109
- You ain't done that for years.
- Yeah.

01:41:42.135 --> 01:41:43.095
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:41:47.140 --> 01:41:50.102
I missed you at the club. What's goin' on?

01:41:51.144 --> 01:41:53.105
Gotta work untiI 11 or so.

01:41:55.148 --> 01:41:57.109
We can hoot and holler after that.

01:41:57.150 --> 01:42:00.112
Like, I can meet you at the club about 12.

01:42:03.156 --> 01:42:05.117
- Want a beer?
- Sure.

01:42:10.163 --> 01:42:12.124
- You OK?
- I'm feeling fucked up.

01:42:15.168 --> 01:42:17.129
I gotta make a pick-up.

01:42:17.170 --> 01:42:20.132
25 grand. Borelli's got some
bullshit Haitian problems.

01:42:26.138 --> 01:42:28.098
Pick-up's at Battery Park.

01:42:34.146 --> 01:42:36.106
I'm fuckin' beat, man.

01:42:37.149 --> 01:42:40.110
I'm gonna ask Frankie
for a little time off.

01:42:40.152 --> 01:42:42.112
I've been working hard.

01:42:45.157 --> 01:42:47.117
So, the parade's coming up.

01:42:49.161 --> 01:42:51.121
Wouldn't that be nice?

01:42:51.163 --> 01:42:54.124
You, me and Kate can go celebrate
St Patty's Day together.

01:42:58.170 --> 01:43:00.130
Go see the parade. Wanna?

01:43:01.131 --> 01:43:03.091
Listen, Jackie. I heard something.

01:43:09.139 --> 01:43:12.100
- I hear Frankie put the hit on Stevie.
- What?

01:43:14.144 --> 01:43:16.104
Hey, hey, hey! Get out!

01:43:16.146 --> 01:43:19.107
That is my fuckin' brother
you're talking about, huh?!

01:43:20.150 --> 01:43:22.110
- I heard it.
- Yeah, you heard it!

01:43:22.152 --> 01:43:25.113
Don't mean you gotta repeat it!
You repeat everything you hear?!

01:43:27.157 --> 01:43:29.117
I'm sorry. I heard it.

01:43:38.168 --> 01:43:41.129
- I oughta shoot your fuckin' eyes out.
- I thought you should know.

01:44:00.148 --> 01:44:02.109
Get out. Get outta here!

01:44:02.150 --> 01:44:03.110
Come on!

01:44:06.154 --> 01:44:08.115
I should wash your mouth out with soap.

01:44:08.156 --> 01:44:11.118
You go somewhere and you think
about what you're saying. Yeah?

01:44:29.136 --> 01:44:32.097
- Battery Park at 11.
- If you're not there, I think he's dead.

01:44:32.139 --> 01:44:35.100
If we see 'em whack each other,
we can get 'em for that.

01:44:35.142 --> 01:44:38.103
You hole up in the hotel
so I can find you if I need you.

01:44:38.145 --> 01:44:40.105
Just be there. I think Jack's goin' down.

01:44:54.161 --> 01:44:56.121
Jackie. How you doin', man?

01:44:59.166 --> 01:45:02.127
- You said you were workin' tonight.
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:45:02.169 --> 01:45:05.130
- Look, I'm sorry I yelled at you.
- Forget it.

01:45:06.131 --> 01:45:09.092
You heard something like that on the
street, but you know it's fuckin' bullshit.

01:45:12.137 --> 01:45:15.098
Whoever told you, we'll talk
with him after the pick-up.

01:45:17.142 --> 01:45:19.102
I want you to back me up, OK?

01:45:20.145 --> 01:45:21.104
Hey, I'm there.

01:45:36.161 --> 01:45:38.121
Why are we here? I thought Battery Park.

01:45:38.163 --> 01:45:40.123
The meeting's been changed to Pier 84.

01:45:41.166 --> 01:45:44.127
Frankie figured it'd be safer.
Guineas won't try jack shit here.

01:46:22.165 --> 01:46:24.126
Listen, you ain't supposed to be here.

01:46:27.170 --> 01:46:29.131
OK, go and wait for me over there.

01:46:31.133 --> 01:46:33.093
- Behind there?
- Yeah. I won't be long.

01:46:33.135 --> 01:46:35.095
- Watch my fuckin' back.
- Yeah.

01:46:41.143 --> 01:46:42.102
Hey.

01:46:46.148 --> 01:46:49.109
I love the noises
Irene makes in bed, man.

01:46:51.153 --> 01:46:52.112
Me, too.

01:47:28.148 --> 01:47:31.109
This is Officer Noonan.
I'm lookin' for Sgt Richardson.

01:47:32.152 --> 01:47:35.113
He's on a stakeout.
That's what I'm calling about.

01:48:01.139 --> 01:48:04.101
Look, I got a change
of 20 for him, all right?

01:48:04.142 --> 01:48:07.104
Tell him it's not Battery Park,
it's Pier 84.

01:48:07.145 --> 01:48:08.105
Hey, Frankie.

01:48:11.149 --> 01:48:12.109
Hi, Jackie.

01:48:14.152 --> 01:48:17.114
- I thought you were the guineas.
- The guineas ain't coming.

01:48:18.156 --> 01:48:21.118
- It's just you and me.
- It's just you and me?

01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:23.120
Yeah.

01:48:38.135 --> 01:48:40.095
Just tell him to get down here!

01:48:46.143 --> 01:48:47.102
Jack!

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:48.121
What the hell is going on?
You tell us one place

01:49:48.163 --> 01:49:51.124
but the shooters are all
at some other goddamn place!

01:49:51.166 --> 01:49:54.127
You know what they'd do
if they knew I was doin' what I been?

01:49:58.131 --> 01:50:01.093
I'd be strung up on some billboard,
my eyes cut out of my head.

01:50:01.134 --> 01:50:03.095
And I'd fuckin' deserve it.

01:50:04.137 --> 01:50:06.098
I ain't your goddamn social worker.

01:50:06.139 --> 01:50:09.101
Now you just tell me
who whacked out Jack Flannery.

01:50:11.144 --> 01:50:14.106
- I don't know.
- What do you mean, you don't know?

01:50:14.147 --> 01:50:16.108
- You were here.
- I wasn't fuckin' here.

01:50:16.149 --> 01:50:19.111
I was over at that phone booth calling you.

01:50:19.152 --> 01:50:22.114
I should have backed up Jack,
but I was over there doin' my rat job.

01:50:23.156 --> 01:50:26.118
Was Flannery here, or his boy?
Who did you see?

01:50:26.159 --> 01:50:29.121
I don't want to do this
any more, all right?!

01:50:29.162 --> 01:50:32.124
I ain't cut out for this undercover shit!
Get yourself an Italian, cos I quit.

01:50:34.167 --> 01:50:37.129
We're on these suckers!
It's just a matter of timing!

01:50:37.170 --> 01:50:38.130
- Timing?
- Yeah!

01:50:38.130 --> 01:50:41.091
These guys don't know what century it is.
And you talk about fucking timing?

01:50:44.136 --> 01:50:45.095
You know what I did?

01:50:47.139 --> 01:50:50.100
I got my best friend killed.
I got Jack killed. That's what I did.

01:50:51.143 --> 01:50:53.103
But it's fucking over.

01:50:53.145 --> 01:50:55.105
Look at me. See? I quit. Good night.

01:50:58.150 --> 01:50:59.109
- Terry.
- Fuck you.

01:51:07.159 --> 01:51:08.118
Hey, Noonan!

01:51:16.168 --> 01:51:17.127
Fucked up, man.

01:51:33.143 --> 01:51:34.102
Kathleen.

01:51:36.146 --> 01:51:37.105
Hi.

01:51:43.153 --> 01:51:46.114
Nobody even knows
what he was doing out there.

01:52:15.143 --> 01:52:16.103
I'm sorry.

01:52:23.151 --> 01:52:25.112
I couldn't have saved Jackie, could I?

01:52:31.159 --> 01:52:34.121
Even though I know it's not true,
I feel I could have.

01:52:40.168 --> 01:52:42.129
But I should have told him what you were.

01:53:17.164 --> 01:53:18.123
Here, Jack.

01:53:21.168 --> 01:53:23.128
You're bound to get thirsty.

01:53:41.146 --> 01:53:42.105
Hey, Terry.

01:53:48.153 --> 01:53:49.112
How's Kathleen?

01:53:51.156 --> 01:53:54.117
She's holding up pretty good.
She's strong. But it's hard.

01:53:57.162 --> 01:53:59.122
It's you I'm worried about.

01:54:00.165 --> 01:54:01.124
What do you mean?

01:54:05.170 --> 01:54:08.131
Do you know where I was
the night this happened?

01:54:11.134 --> 01:54:12.094
I was on Pier 84.

01:54:27.150 --> 01:54:30.112
Noonan, if you and me
are on a collision course,

01:54:32.155 --> 01:54:34.116
that would not be very smart of you.

01:54:38.161 --> 01:54:40.122
You know how smart you are?

01:54:46.169 --> 01:54:48.130
That's how smart you are.

01:55:05.147 --> 01:55:06.106
He's dead.

01:55:07.149 --> 01:55:09.109
The fuck's dead. Do you see that?

01:55:10.152 --> 01:55:11.111
Motherfucker.

01:55:26.168 --> 01:55:27.127
Who is it?

01:55:29.129 --> 01:55:30.088
 Kate?

01:55:34.134 --> 01:55:37.095
Kate, I feel awful
about the things I was.

01:55:40.140 --> 01:55:43.101
Kate, you just gotta give me
a minute on this, all right?

01:55:48.148 --> 01:55:51.109
If you don't want me here, just tell me.
But let me see your face so I believe it.

01:55:53.153 --> 01:55:56.114
Terry, I'm telling you the truth.
I'm telling you the God's truth.

01:55:59.159 --> 01:56:02.120
Bastard! You're dragging me in,
making me part of it!

01:56:02.162 --> 01:56:04.122
You want me to drown?
I gotta save my life!

01:56:04.164 --> 01:56:07.125
I know, but I need to explain.
I need you to understand.

01:56:07.167 --> 01:56:09.127
- I understand.
- You're not listening.

01:56:10.170 --> 01:56:12.130
Would you just fuckin' listen?

01:56:23.141 --> 01:56:25.102
I thought some things.
I could come back.

01:56:30.148 --> 01:56:32.109
I always hated that I'd run away.

01:56:33.151 --> 01:56:36.113
Had nothing to do with you, except I knew
if I tried to tell you, I'd never get away.

01:56:45.163 --> 01:56:48.125
So I was in Boston. I just ended up there.

01:56:55.132 --> 01:56:57.092
It seemed far enough away.

01:57:02.139 --> 01:57:05.100
It come to me then. It just happened.
These things happen.

01:57:06.143 --> 01:57:08.103
Other things happen. It's your life.

01:57:15.152 --> 01:57:18.113
They were looking for somebody to go
undercover who knew the Kitchen,

01:57:19.156 --> 01:57:20.115
who was known.

01:57:23.160 --> 01:57:26.121
I could've said no,
but I thought I could do it.

01:57:28.165 --> 01:57:31.126
It was like this opportunity.
I could look the entire thing in the eye.

01:57:32.169 --> 01:57:35.130
You'd be married, forgotten about me.
And Jack, I would leave him out of it.

01:57:40.135 --> 01:57:42.095
But it was only an idea.

01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:48.101
Nothing to do with the truth. It was just...

01:57:50.145 --> 01:57:52.105
a fuckin' idea, like...

01:57:56.151 --> 01:57:58.111
you believe... in angels or the saints

01:58:01.156 --> 01:58:04.117
or that there's such a thing
as a state of grace,

01:58:06.161 --> 01:58:07.120
and you believe it.

01:58:11.166 --> 01:58:13.126
But it's got nothing to do with reality.

01:58:15.170 --> 01:58:18.131
It's just an idea. You got
your ideas and you got reality.

01:58:23.136 --> 01:58:24.096
They're all...

01:58:31.144 --> 01:58:33.105
They're all fucked up.

01:58:53.166 --> 01:58:54.126
I was going out.

01:58:56.169 --> 01:58:58.130
I gotta go. I gotta get ready.

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:05.095
He's someone I met at work.
He's taking me out for a drink.

01:59:10.142 --> 01:59:12.102
- Frank killed Jack.
- Did he?

01:59:20.152 --> 01:59:22.112
I gotta go down now. He's waiting.

01:59:27.159 --> 01:59:29.119
- You're cold, Kate.
- Yes, I am.

01:59:31.163 --> 01:59:34.124
I don't mind you got a date.
I really don't.

01:59:34.166 --> 01:59:36.126
I ain't jealous. I got a date, too.

01:59:41.131 --> 01:59:44.092
Is there something you want me
to tell Frankie for you when I see him?

01:59:47.137 --> 01:59:49.097
Make sure, when you leave,
the button's pushed in

01:59:49.139 --> 01:59:52.100
and the door's pulled tight before you go.

02:00:09.159 --> 02:00:11.119
- What did you find out, Pat?
- Nobody knows him.

02:00:11.161 --> 02:00:14.122
- They must've brought him from Boston.
- From Boston, to rat us out.

02:00:15.165 --> 02:00:18.126
Don't matter where
the cocksucker's from. He's dead.

02:00:19.169 --> 02:00:22.130
It's 15,000 when he takes his last breath.
You bring me his rat head, it's 30,000.

02:00:34.142 --> 02:00:36.103
- Where the fuck is he?
- Check it out.

02:00:41.149 --> 02:00:43.110
What the fuck are you doin'?

02:01:35.162 --> 02:01:38.123
"After all these years,
a perfect St Patrick's Day"

02:01:41.168 --> 02:01:44.129
"Warm sun shining down,
temperature in the sixties"
