00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.600 --> 00:13.267
The Geordies are back!
Hello!

00:13.333 --> 00:14.933
Doing the things we love.

00:15.000 --> 00:18.100
(cheering)
(Scott) But this time...

00:18.167 --> 00:20.167
...man's gonna mix things right
up.

00:24.400 --> 00:26.200
(knocking)
(gasps)

00:26.267 --> 00:28.500
With four newbies!
Oh, my God!

00:28.567 --> 00:30.167
It's gonna be fuckin' mint.

00:31.800 --> 00:34.933
Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.

00:35.000 --> 00:36.700
I love a bit of change, me.

00:37.967 --> 00:40.067
But some things never change.

00:42.667 --> 00:44.533
I love this family.

00:46.267 --> 00:48.800
(bell rings)
Ding-fucking-ding, dicks.

00:48.867 --> 00:50.100
(cheering)

00:50.167 --> 00:52.200
Take it all in, bitch.
Take it all in.

00:52.267 --> 00:55.633
I want yous to see
what Belfast has to offer.

00:55.700 --> 00:57.633
Buzzing off my little man tits
to go.

00:57.700 --> 00:59.667
Let's have a fucking wicked
night!

00:59.733 --> 01:00.733
(cheering)

01:00.800 --> 01:03.900
I'm sure I can hear
Bethan and Beau...

01:03.967 --> 01:06.633
Beau, you not already been
smashing oysters?

01:06.700 --> 01:10.233
Since I seen Jay at the party, I
feel so far away from my
boyfriend.

01:10.300 --> 01:12.200
I feel a little bit lost.

01:12.267 --> 01:14.033
Tahlia...

01:14.100 --> 01:15.533
That barman is really fit.

01:15.600 --> 01:17.233
Wanna come out with us?
Yeah.

01:17.300 --> 01:18.667
(laughter)

01:18.733 --> 01:23.567
I wish that Sam was all over me
the way Beau is all over Bethan.

01:23.633 --> 01:26.600
Making me feel shit.
I didn't wanna fucking be with
you!

01:26.667 --> 01:28.067
What's gotten into Chloe?

01:28.133 --> 01:30.533
I just think we should
go on a bit of a break.

01:30.600 --> 01:32.600
(cries) Embarrassing, isn't it?

01:32.667 --> 01:36.400
Tell someone you're insecure,
like especially not your
partner.

01:36.467 --> 01:37.500
(cries)

01:39.200 --> 01:40.867
I'm preened to perfection.

01:40.933 --> 01:43.067
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:43.133 --> 01:46.033
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:46.100 --> 01:49.633
Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy.
I'm all over the place.

01:49.700 --> 01:52.433
I'm that good-looking,
I'd even neck on myself.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.233
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:55.300 --> 01:58.100
I might dance like a granddad,
but I'm proper radge.

01:58.167 --> 02:00.833
I'm fake, I'm flirty
and I've got double-Fs.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.400
I might look rough and ready,
but I'm a massive softie.

02:04.467 --> 02:07.700
I cannot believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:07.767 --> 02:09.967
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:18.667 --> 02:22.200
I put me and Sam on a break
earlier
and I feel like I could vom.

02:22.267 --> 02:25.467
I shouldn't be out but I need
to get through this somehow.

02:27.700 --> 02:29.367
I'm so over this.

02:29.433 --> 02:34.300
I'm confused, pissed off and
angry.
Some trip this has turned out to
be.

02:37.300 --> 02:39.800
(Bethan) Since it all kicked off
at the pub,

02:39.867 --> 02:41.867
Sam and Chloe still haven't
spoke.

02:41.933 --> 02:45.833
I've never seen Chloe this low,
so
I need to be there for her
tonight.

02:53.500 --> 02:55.400
(club music)

03:00.067 --> 03:04.367
The tension between Sam and
Chloe
is absolutely unbearable.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.433
(Nat) This is our last night
in Belfast.

03:14.500 --> 03:17.500
The tension is sucking the life
out
of what fun was left.

03:23.767 --> 03:27.433
Chloe and Sam's fight has
completely
split the family in half.

03:27.500 --> 03:30.600
I hate seeing my friends like
this.

03:36.833 --> 03:40.300
A lot of shit going down but I'm
not
gonna let that ruin my night.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.933
Especially with Bethan
looking that fit.

04:01.833 --> 04:06.000
The fact that Beau is
understanding
that I've gotta be there for
Chloe

04:06.067 --> 04:08.233
is making us like him so much
more.

04:22.533 --> 04:25.233
Right now, Chloe and Sam
are blanking each other.

04:25.300 --> 04:28.167
I'm gonna step in
and find out what's going on.

04:31.767 --> 04:35.367
Me and Sam are a mess. To be
honest,
I just don't know how to fix it.

05:01.867 --> 05:04.567
Chloe shouldn't compare
what she has with others.

05:04.633 --> 05:06.933
She's in a long-term
loving relationship.

05:07.000 --> 05:09.400
That's worth more than a bum
squeeze
in a club.

05:17.233 --> 05:21.167
Nathan's right. I just can't
bring
meself to face him yet.

05:21.233 --> 05:23.133
Everything is still so raw.

05:30.733 --> 05:32.533
Hello.

05:41.767 --> 05:42.900
(yells)

05:44.533 --> 05:47.933
Thank God the hot guy from the
pub
earlier actually showed up.

05:48.000 --> 05:50.367
He's just what I needed
to make my night.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.067
Stu, man, come here,
I wanna slurp you up.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.400
Stu-stu! At least Tahlia's got
a one-way ticket out of this.

06:09.033 --> 06:13.200
I thought they spoke English
here.
Maybe he'll understand this...

06:17.800 --> 06:22.067
(Sophie) Fair play to Tahlia.
A little fun is what she needs.

06:22.133 --> 06:24.600
That's how I got over my ex
Joel,

06:24.667 --> 06:27.833
by hooking up with Aussie Alex
in Australia.

06:27.900 --> 06:30.067
Oh, my God!

06:32.133 --> 06:34.200
Well, that's lightened the mood.

06:43.767 --> 06:46.733
(Nat) I'm not gonna let
these muppets ruin my night.

06:46.800 --> 06:48.800
I'm gonna get my grind on.

07:06.400 --> 07:09.867
I'm pissed off with what Chloe's
doing. She doesn't wanna hurt
me,

07:09.933 --> 07:12.900
yet she's put me on a break.
I am hurt and I'm pissed off.

07:16.767 --> 07:21.233
Enough is enough. We need to
leave
the club and go somewhere quiet.

07:21.300 --> 07:23.367
These two aren't gonna talk in
here.

07:28.200 --> 07:32.233
We've gotta leave early. Chloe
was
upset and family does come
first.

07:37.100 --> 07:40.867
(Bethan) Chloe has had a shit
night.
I don't know who's right or
wrong.

07:40.933 --> 07:43.967
But she's my best mate
and I'll always have her back.

07:46.167 --> 07:49.900
The tension between Chloe and
Sam
is still ruining everyone's
night.

07:49.967 --> 07:52.200
We need to get this sorted
pronto.

07:52.267 --> 07:54.767
Can I just say one thing now?
Me and Chloe spoke.

07:54.833 --> 07:57.267
Me and Chloe...
She explained the reason.

07:57.333 --> 08:03.000
You should speak when you get
home
cos what we think...

08:03.067 --> 08:07.033
I'm not gonna speak about...
Whatever she's...

08:07.100 --> 08:08.600
(overlapping chatter)

08:08.667 --> 08:11.700
Chloe needs to go home for a
bit.
Of course she does.

08:11.767 --> 08:14.033
She's dealing with stuff
personally.

08:14.100 --> 08:17.300
Listen, you don't know nothing.
Been here two minutes. Hey!

08:17.367 --> 08:20.633
I'm only trying to help!
You don't need to be rude.

08:20.700 --> 08:22.567
I'm not being fucking rude!

08:22.633 --> 08:25.300
I mean... you are being a bit
rude.

08:25.367 --> 08:27.833
I'm not being fucking rude!

08:27.900 --> 08:28.933
Fucking rude?!

08:29.000 --> 08:32.267
They're rude, sticking noses
into
mine and Chloe's business.

08:32.332 --> 08:34.533
Who's being fucking rude?!

08:34.600 --> 08:38.967
Because you can't fucking handle
what's in the fucking group
chat!

08:39.033 --> 08:42.767
To be honest, Sam and Chloe's
relationship problems make me
think,

08:42.832 --> 08:46.500
"Do I really wanna be here when
I
could be at home with me
boyfriend?"

08:46.567 --> 08:50.467
What the fuck was that? I get...
I tell you what it's coming
from.

08:50.533 --> 08:52.633
Frustration.
Yes.

08:56.967 --> 09:00.100
Chloe Ferry said to me, she
went,
"I want the break."

09:00.167 --> 09:02.533
Have it. Cos you know what?
I am done.

09:02.600 --> 09:06.133
I know I've been here two
minutes.
We were trying to have your
back.

09:09.333 --> 09:12.433
I think it's best that me and
Sam
just go back to the bus

09:12.500 --> 09:14.333
and let these lot calm down.

09:19.500 --> 09:23.000
We're going, but no chance
I'm leaving these bad boys
behind.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.467
Chloe should not have to put up
with this. Sam has lost his
head.

09:30.533 --> 09:33.767
I'm taking us to the hotel.
These two need some space.

09:45.867 --> 09:49.000
(Nat) Our last night in Belfast
has been an utter disaster.

09:49.067 --> 09:50.933
I hate seeing my friends fight.

09:51.000 --> 09:54.400
I really hope Chloe and Sam
can fix things in the morning.

09:55.767 --> 10:00.033
It started in the pizza shop
and then it just went, "Whoa".

10:00.100 --> 10:03.700
I physically don't know what
more
I can say to make her happy.

10:03.767 --> 10:08.967
I've tried so much. And whatever
I do
is not good enough for her.

10:09.033 --> 10:12.133
This is the worst place
Chloe and me have ever been in.

10:12.200 --> 10:15.200
Right now, I'm not even sure
whether we're together.

10:15.267 --> 10:17.367
This is a fucking disaster.

10:25.367 --> 10:27.533
Tonight has gone from bad to
worse.

10:27.600 --> 10:30.433
I never thought things
would get this low between us.

10:30.500 --> 10:32.300
What are your thoughts right
now?

10:32.367 --> 10:35.867
Do you, at the minute,
think is Sam the one for ya?

10:35.933 --> 10:38.900
I don't know.
My head's fucking battered,
mate.

10:38.967 --> 10:41.833
Me head is fucking battered.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.433
I have been fucked over
my whole life.

10:50.500 --> 10:52.567
I'm really upset.

10:52.633 --> 10:53.967
What the fuck?!

10:54.033 --> 10:56.133
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:58.967 --> 10:59.167
.

11:01.700 --> 11:01.900
.

11:17.467 --> 11:19.000
Good morning.

11:19.067 --> 11:21.200
Sam.
Yeah?

11:21.267 --> 11:23.400
Have the girls come back or not?

11:24.567 --> 11:25.600
Nah.

11:25.667 --> 11:30.033
I've woken up feeling broken.
Chloe's not even back on the
bus.

11:30.100 --> 11:32.267
I don't even have a clue
whether she's OK,

11:32.333 --> 11:33.933
whether we're even together.

11:34.000 --> 11:37.133
No, I think they stayed in a
hotel
last night, you know?

11:37.200 --> 11:39.100
I fucking wish I did.

11:39.167 --> 11:41.400
I'm going for a fucking shit.

11:47.800 --> 11:48.867
(sighs) Right.

11:51.000 --> 11:54.500
The sooner we get up... then
the quicker we'll get to
Newcastle.

11:55.467 --> 11:58.867
I've woken up in a hotel and
regret
putting me and Sam on a break.

11:58.933 --> 11:59.967
Why did I do it?

12:01.133 --> 12:04.467
How are you feeling?
What do you wanna do, Chloe?

12:04.533 --> 12:09.233
I don't know. Like, I don't
know.
Like, obviously, I love Sam so
much.

12:09.300 --> 12:11.533
I want to spend the rest of my
life
with him.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.767
But I just need to... I think
I need to work on myself for a
bit.

12:14.833 --> 12:18.033
I'm so happy I've got Bethan
here
for support.

12:18.100 --> 12:21.133
We need to get back to the bus
and literally face reality.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.367
I'll get me lashes.

12:26.667 --> 12:28.833
Has anyone seen my hairspray?

12:28.900 --> 12:31.400
It's in there.
It's strong, that one, though.

12:31.467 --> 12:34.100
Speaking of strong,
last night was a bit strong.

12:34.167 --> 12:36.033
Last night was very strong.
Woo!

12:36.100 --> 12:38.500
The last two days
have been really weird.

12:38.567 --> 12:42.300
One minute, me and Chloe are
sound.
The next, she's pushing me away.

12:42.367 --> 12:44.533
I do wanna be with her.
I love her to bits.

12:44.600 --> 12:47.433
But I'm so frustrated
and so out of the loop,

12:47.500 --> 12:49.533
because I don't know what's
going on.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.100
I don't know what's going on
cos she won't talk.

12:52.167 --> 12:53.833
I really feel bad for Sam.

12:53.900 --> 12:57.967
Chloe thinks he can't handle her
insecurities cos of
ex-boyfriends.

12:58.033 --> 13:00.433
But she's not giving him a
chance.

13:00.500 --> 13:03.300
It's just fucking hard, isn't
it,
like. (groans)

13:04.867 --> 13:05.967
(exhales)

13:07.100 --> 13:08.300
(rain pouring)

13:09.633 --> 13:10.900
(sizzling)

13:12.867 --> 13:14.200
This is grim.

13:14.267 --> 13:18.567
After all the kick-offs last
night,
I didn't get any food. I'm
starving.

13:18.633 --> 13:21.333
How are you feeling?
Shattered. Same.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.533
I wonder how Chloe and Bethan
are.
I know.

13:24.600 --> 13:27.200
I don't understand
what the fuck was going on.

13:27.267 --> 13:29.767
Is that Rhubarb and Custard?

13:29.833 --> 13:31.167
Rhubarb and Custard!

13:31.233 --> 13:33.800
Thank God Sam isn't with the
girls.

13:33.867 --> 13:36.633
I just don't think Chloe
is ready to face him yet.

13:36.700 --> 13:39.000
It looks like we had
a dirty stop-out.

13:39.067 --> 13:42.667
Feel a little bit better, like
I went back to the hotel last
night.

13:42.733 --> 13:44.600
Rather than come back.
Yeah.

13:44.667 --> 13:48.133
What's your plan of action,
Chlo?
So, I think this morning...

13:48.200 --> 13:49.900
I feel like I need to chat to
him.

13:49.967 --> 13:52.267
My head is literally about
to explode.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.867
I need to tell my boyfriend
what's going on,

13:54.933 --> 13:57.133
but I'm so scared
and so embarrassed too.

13:57.200 --> 14:01.200
Obviously, I do want to be with
him
but honestly, it's me.

14:01.267 --> 14:03.167
I wish I could fix Chloe.

14:03.233 --> 14:06.333
And I do wish that I can stop
her
feeling insecure.

14:06.400 --> 14:09.000
But the only way that Sam
is gonna love her more

14:09.067 --> 14:10.833
is if she loves herself.

14:10.900 --> 14:14.200
Right... get back on the party
bus.

14:14.267 --> 14:17.300
Chloe can't put off seeing Sam
for any longer.

14:17.367 --> 14:21.000
The ferry won't wait for
nae-one.
I'm not gonna get stuck in
Belfast.

14:37.533 --> 14:40.967
I'm glad Chloe's OK.
But am I not even worth a hello?

14:41.033 --> 14:43.133
I can't wait
to get back to town now.

14:43.200 --> 14:47.033
Honestly, I'm really, really
buzzing
to get back to Newcastle.

14:48.033 --> 14:51.267
This is gonna be
one long journey back.

15:03.033 --> 15:05.100
I'm not ready to speak to Sam,

15:05.167 --> 15:08.633
but I've put it off way too long
now
and it's not fair on him.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.633
(clears throat)

15:13.233 --> 15:15.167
Can I speak to Sam, please?

15:15.233 --> 15:17.833
At last, Chloe has come to
talk to Sam.

15:17.900 --> 15:21.833
Hopefully now, they can finally
get
their relationship back on
track.

15:24.533 --> 15:26.067
How are you feeling?

15:27.567 --> 15:31.333
Really... weird cos I don't
understand what's going on.

15:31.400 --> 15:34.167
Cos, obviously, yesterday
in the, erm, pub...

15:34.233 --> 15:37.133
...like, you said some things
and then you just left.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.100
Told the girls but didn't tell
me.

15:39.167 --> 15:40.667
So, obviously, like...

15:41.833 --> 15:44.533
...with me past and stuff,

15:44.600 --> 15:47.267
I'm so scarred from it, right?
I'm honestly...

15:47.333 --> 15:50.733
I'm really, really an insecure
person. Like, very insecure.

15:51.900 --> 15:57.367
Like, it's not fair on you
that I keep taking it out on
you.

15:57.433 --> 15:58.833
It's just not fair on you.

15:58.900 --> 16:02.467
I have been fucked over by lads
my whole life.

16:02.533 --> 16:04.533
And now that I've got a good
boy,

16:04.600 --> 16:07.200
my insecurities won't
let us enjoy it.

16:11.433 --> 16:14.133
As you said yesterday,
you wanted to go on a break.

16:14.200 --> 16:17.100
Done everything,
I've changed to make you
happier.

16:17.167 --> 16:19.333
I don't know what more
you want me to do.

16:19.400 --> 16:22.200
I think you want something else,
by the sounds of it.

16:22.267 --> 16:24.700
You are perfect.
Like, you are, honestly.

16:24.767 --> 16:26.633
What you on about then?

16:26.700 --> 16:28.867
I'm telling you how I'm feeling.

16:30.433 --> 16:33.567
Well, OK, erm...
Where do we go from here?

16:36.500 --> 16:39.733
Do you think you can give us
more?
More what?

16:39.800 --> 16:43.000
More affection? More attention?
As in what, though, Chloe?

16:43.067 --> 16:44.967
I want you to be all over us.

16:45.033 --> 16:48.400
I want you... Like the way that
they go on, the couples
upstairs.

16:53.533 --> 16:56.733
Go back, first night in Belfast,
we were all over each other.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.800
Me, you, Bethan, Beau
having a dance off, necking on.

16:59.867 --> 17:02.167
I know we were. Yeah, we were.

17:02.233 --> 17:05.233
OK, so what more do you want me
to do? Shagging in the club?

17:05.300 --> 17:08.333
No, I don't. I want you to be
like that every fucking night.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.633
Well, in that case, no.

17:10.700 --> 17:14.099
I can't give physically give you
any more attention that that.

17:15.032 --> 17:17.700
Chloe, Beau and Bethan are
just starting out

17:17.767 --> 17:20.000
in the honeymoon period.

17:20.067 --> 17:22.032
What we have is so much more
than that.

17:22.099 --> 17:24.000
I just wish you could see it.

17:27.433 --> 17:29.067
I'm really upset.

17:32.433 --> 17:36.833
It's hard to say. It's not nice
telling me boyfriend I'm
insecure.

17:36.900 --> 17:40.100
That's why I go to the girls.
I'm not gonna go, "I'm
insecure."

17:40.167 --> 17:41.867
You can tell me anything.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.733
You can tell me anything.

17:45.800 --> 17:49.300
The first person I come to
if I had a problem is you.

17:49.367 --> 17:51.833
Yeah, cos you're confident. I'm
not.

17:57.200 --> 17:59.400
You are.
You're such a good boyfriend.

17:59.467 --> 18:02.767
I just can't accept, like,
I'm so used to getting fucked
over.

18:02.833 --> 18:04.367
I would hate to lose you

18:04.433 --> 18:07.500
and that's why I always kick off
cos I get scared.

18:08.700 --> 18:13.200
So what do you want me to do?
Just keep being you.

18:13.267 --> 18:16.900
The last thing I wanna do is
to lose Chloe cos she is my
world.

18:16.967 --> 18:20.033
So I'm gonna do whatever it
takes.
I just hope it's enough.

18:22.167 --> 18:24.000
Obviously, I need to work on
myself

18:24.067 --> 18:26.233
and I need to learn
to love myself again.

18:26.300 --> 18:30.100
So I just need you...
just a little bit more
affection.

18:30.167 --> 18:33.533
Just a little bit. Just try.
Mm-hmm.

18:33.600 --> 18:35.000
Feel like that would help.

18:35.067 --> 18:38.100
I feel like a huge weight has
been
lifted off my shoulders.

18:38.167 --> 18:41.333
Being honest with Sam is
the best thing I've ever done.

18:47.533 --> 18:49.000
(seagulls caw)

18:52.200 --> 18:55.267
(ferry horn blares)

19:04.600 --> 19:06.333
(Nathan) It's good to be back.

19:06.400 --> 19:10.933
Let's hope that being home
brings
the fun back into the family.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.667
(cheering)

19:13.933 --> 19:15.000
Let's unpack!

19:15.067 --> 19:17.000
In Belfast, everything kicked
off.

19:17.067 --> 19:20.333
I'm so glad Sam and Chloe have
started speaking again.

19:23.300 --> 19:26.300
You just appreciate the house
a lot more when you go away.

19:26.367 --> 19:29.733
I need to get out of these
clothes.
I feel minging.

19:32.367 --> 19:33.933
(phone ringing)

19:34.000 --> 19:35.200
I'll get it!

19:35.267 --> 19:38.800
We've barely unpacked
and the phone is going.

19:38.867 --> 19:42.133
I bet it's Anna.
Howay, man! Give us a break.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.200
(phone ringing)

19:43.267 --> 19:45.367
Hello.
"Hi, Sam. It's Anna."

19:45.433 --> 19:47.667
Hiya, you all right?
"Right, listen."

19:47.733 --> 19:50.467
"No rest for you lot today.
You've got work."

19:50.533 --> 19:53.333
"Yous are all going
and it's Disco Dodgeball."

19:53.400 --> 19:55.333
Disco Dodgeball?

19:55.400 --> 19:56.867
What the fuck's that?

19:56.933 --> 19:59.833
"Scott'll meet you there."
Right. I'll let them know.

19:59.900 --> 20:01.033
What?

20:02.600 --> 20:06.100
Today we're going to do
Disco Dodgeball.

20:06.167 --> 20:08.433
That sounds interesting,
but I'm puzzled.

20:08.500 --> 20:13.200
Why would anyone wanna dodge
balls?
Howay, let's get ready.

20:23.300 --> 20:24.433
(groans)

20:24.500 --> 20:27.633
Don't be scared of it. Get in
there.
I am getting in there!

20:27.700 --> 20:31.033
Wearing short shorts requires
a smooth bum.

20:31.100 --> 20:34.233
I need to trim this fucker.
Right now it looks like King
Kong.

20:35.233 --> 20:38.600
Right, I'm not being funny
but that is perfect.

20:38.667 --> 20:40.033
I do love dressing up

20:40.100 --> 20:43.567
but these costumes look like
I'm off on a fucking hen night.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.000
What the fuck?!

21:02.067 --> 21:04.567
I am in shock.
I don't know what to do right
now.

21:04.633 --> 21:06.633
Suck my dick!

21:07.767 --> 21:09.767
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:13.467 --> 21:13.667
.

21:16.200 --> 21:16.400
.

21:25.267 --> 21:27.300
(knocking)
I...

21:28.733 --> 21:31.533
Howdy, howdy!
Let's get fucking rowdy!

21:31.600 --> 21:33.667
What the fuck?!

21:33.733 --> 21:36.700
I'm back, people.
I'm here for work and a good
time.

21:36.767 --> 21:40.900
I'm not gonna lie, I've missed
my
Geordie family. Especially
Sophie.

21:40.967 --> 21:42.533
How are you going? Gnarly.

21:42.600 --> 21:44.467
Who is this? He's not a Geordie!

21:44.533 --> 21:47.600
Oh, my God. Is that a joke?

21:47.667 --> 21:50.233
I'd recognise that Aussie accent
anywhere.

21:50.300 --> 21:53.033
You have got to be kidding us.

21:53.100 --> 21:55.367
Mate! I didn't expect that!

21:55.433 --> 21:58.600
Alex is like a boomerang.
He's back again.

21:58.667 --> 21:59.900
What the hell?!

21:59.967 --> 22:03.467
I can't believe that Alex, my
Aussie
brother from another mother,

22:03.533 --> 22:04.733
is back!

22:04.800 --> 22:07.267
But Sophie is not gonna like
this.

22:09.267 --> 22:11.833
Alex and Sophie used to have a
thing
a while back.

22:11.900 --> 22:15.067
Doesn't he know Sophie's got
a boyfriend? What's he doing?

22:15.133 --> 22:17.700
Why are you always in Newcastle,
Alex! Why?!

22:17.767 --> 22:19.733
I can't leave you alone! Come
here!

22:19.800 --> 22:22.433
Keep me warm... (muffled speech)

22:22.500 --> 22:25.067
I never thought in a million
years

22:25.133 --> 22:28.200
Alex would be returning
to this house.

22:28.267 --> 22:32.167
Right now, I'm genuinely in...
shock.

22:34.133 --> 22:36.033
How's it been?
Yeah, good. Good.

22:36.100 --> 22:37.667
(giggles)

22:37.733 --> 22:39.433
Last time me and Sophie got
close

22:39.500 --> 22:43.033
and if we can pick up where we
left
off, I'll be one happy Aussie.

22:43.100 --> 22:46.100
What's been going on?
Not much. What's been with you?

22:46.167 --> 22:48.300
I've got a boyfriend now,
what can I say?

22:48.367 --> 22:52.700
She's got a boyfriend? Ah, mate.
Maybe I should have called
first.

22:52.767 --> 22:55.767
I got traded in, didn't I?
(laughter)

22:55.833 --> 22:59.000
We've got Tahlia...
This is Tahlia, Bethan, best
friend.

22:59.067 --> 23:01.767
This is Natalie. And this is
Beau.
She's a lesbian!

23:01.833 --> 23:03.967
You a single lad
or what's happening?

23:04.033 --> 23:05.467
I'm single, kind of.

23:05.533 --> 23:07.967
Bethan, is he single?
No.

23:08.033 --> 23:10.300
I'm single cos
she hasn't asked me out yet.

23:10.367 --> 23:11.900
Unless that's what that was.

23:11.967 --> 23:15.233
Er, Tahlia's single.
Oi-oi!

23:15.300 --> 23:18.933
Alex isn't my usual type.
But he seems nice enough.

23:19.000 --> 23:22.800
Although Sophie looks
really shocked to see him.

23:25.567 --> 23:28.200
It's not like me and Alex
ever had a relationship.

23:28.267 --> 23:30.733
It was just like
a little bit of a romance.

23:30.800 --> 23:34.167
But now he's just walked in,
I'm in such a different
headspace.

23:34.233 --> 23:36.400
Already, I don't know
whether to be here.

23:36.467 --> 23:38.200
And he's just fucking walked in.

23:38.267 --> 23:41.267
Imagine my boyfriend sitting
at home now thinking...

23:41.333 --> 23:43.567
Knowing he's here,
who I've slept with.

23:43.633 --> 23:46.800
Like, I'm not even fucking going
to work today. No way am I.

23:46.867 --> 23:50.867
Seeing Alex has made me miss Jay
more than I've already been
feeling.

23:50.933 --> 23:53.700
And I just know that Jay
is much more important

23:53.767 --> 23:55.467
than anybody in this house.

23:57.367 --> 24:00.233
Was that a bit awkward,
walking in and seeing Soph?

24:00.300 --> 24:04.200
I came with the intentions of
getting
with Soph and now it's
different.

24:04.267 --> 24:07.533
To be honest, I'm pretty
disappointed
Sophie's got a fella.

24:07.600 --> 24:10.400
But I understand the situation
and I am happy for her.

24:10.467 --> 24:12.067
I get where she's coming from

24:12.133 --> 24:14.633
cos she's sort of at the time
now
where she's...

24:14.700 --> 24:17.000
Ready to settle down.
You weren't that man?

24:17.067 --> 24:18.467
I don't think I was.

24:18.533 --> 24:19.833
Alex seems nice enough.

24:19.900 --> 24:23.000
Let's hope his arrival
doesn't cause any more problems

24:23.067 --> 24:25.533
cos this house can't handle
any more drama.

24:25.600 --> 24:26.967
Well...

24:27.033 --> 24:29.733
So, I'm just gonna stay behind.
Oh, why?

24:29.800 --> 24:31.600
Don't just kick back cos I'm
here.

24:31.667 --> 24:33.533
I get why Sophie's staying at
home.

24:33.600 --> 24:35.967
I wouldn't wanna go to work
with my ex either.

24:36.033 --> 24:38.833
Bye-bye.
Love you. Love ya, right?

24:48.300 --> 24:50.900
Welcome to work, Alex.
The first day back.

24:50.967 --> 24:54.467
Anna sent us to Disco Dodgeball?
Apparently this is work.

24:56.967 --> 25:00.267
First rule, always be prepared!
Oh, my God, yeah!

25:00.333 --> 25:01.633
Whoa!

25:01.700 --> 25:03.567
How are you?
(Alex) Good.

25:03.633 --> 25:05.800
These lot have rocked up
in daft outfits.

25:05.867 --> 25:08.000
That Australian kid Alex
is here again.

25:08.067 --> 25:12.033
(Australian accent) Well, hello.
You cannot help come back for
more.

25:12.100 --> 25:16.067
Where's Sophie, by the way?
Is that cos you rocked up?
(laughs)

25:16.133 --> 25:19.367
Scotty, what the fuck do you
think?
Of course it is.

25:19.433 --> 25:21.800
Yous know you're playing
dodgeball today.

25:21.867 --> 25:24.700
Dodge-duck-dick. Fucking dive
dodge.
That shit?

25:24.767 --> 25:29.633
I'm gonna be the referee, as
well.
So that means whatever I say,
goes.

25:29.700 --> 25:31.867
Fuck off. (laughs)

25:31.933 --> 25:34.633
I haven't played dodgeball
since I was about four.

25:34.700 --> 25:36.533
But this should be a frisk.

25:36.600 --> 25:37.767
Two teams.

25:38.800 --> 25:42.733
Bethan, Sam, Chloe, Alex, you're
one.
Orange bibs, whack 'em on.

25:42.800 --> 25:45.733
Rest of you, green bibs.
Fucking let's go!

25:46.533 --> 25:49.167
Has Scott got a height
restriction
for our team?

25:49.233 --> 25:50.767
We're all under four foot!

25:50.833 --> 25:53.767
Suck my dick!

25:53.833 --> 25:56.367
Bitches!
(cheering)

25:56.433 --> 25:57.600
(yells)

25:57.667 --> 25:59.467
Oh, shit!

25:59.533 --> 26:02.433
Go, Tahlia! That girl's
got some serious moves!

26:02.500 --> 26:04.000
Defo my type of Sheila.

26:04.067 --> 26:06.133
Let's play some fucking
dodgeball!

26:06.200 --> 26:08.367
Three, two, one, go!
(blows whistle)

26:08.433 --> 26:11.133
(yelling)

26:11.200 --> 26:13.700
Not here to take part!
Here to fucking win!

26:13.767 --> 26:15.033
Now throw some balls!

26:17.400 --> 26:19.667
Happy we weren't playing this
in Belfast.

26:19.733 --> 26:22.333
I'd have taken Sam's head clean
off.

26:28.067 --> 26:31.033
Alex, this is for Sophie not
being
at work

26:31.100 --> 26:33.200
cos of your Australian ugly
head.

26:34.767 --> 26:35.800
(Alex) Oh!

26:42.733 --> 26:43.967
My brain is fried.

26:44.033 --> 26:46.967
All I keep thinking is if the
shoe
was on the other foot,

26:47.033 --> 26:50.800
and I'd imagine how I'd feel if
Jay
was living in the house with
someone

26:50.867 --> 26:53.667
that he'd been with,
it would be horrendous.

26:56.000 --> 26:58.000
I don't know what to do right
now.

26:58.067 --> 27:01.800
I've struggled this time round.
Especially being away from Jay.

27:01.867 --> 27:04.933
But Alex being here is
a whole new added pressure.

27:05.000 --> 27:08.600
This could be an absolute
disaster
for my relationship.

27:28.133 --> 27:29.300
(yelling)

27:30.900 --> 27:32.500
(whistle blows)
So, yeah.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.900
Green team fucking clearly won
that,
like.

27:34.967 --> 27:36.067
(cheering)

27:36.133 --> 27:38.167
To be honest, I don't know who
won.

27:38.233 --> 27:41.833
Gonna pick the green team. They
were less shitter than the
orange.

27:41.900 --> 27:45.100
Right, fuck off! Get yourselves
away!

27:47.733 --> 27:50.500
(laughs)

27:50.567 --> 27:52.333
A lot's changed since I was
here.

27:52.400 --> 27:56.233
I can always get the low-down
from
Nathan when it comes to the
family.

27:56.300 --> 27:58.467
Why don't you think
Sophie came today?

27:58.533 --> 28:00.633
Do you think, generally,
she's...?

28:00.700 --> 28:03.000
I think...
Is she not happy that I'm here?

28:03.067 --> 28:04.667
She gonna tell her boyfriend?

28:04.733 --> 28:07.667
I don't think she's not happy.
Yous were good friends.

28:07.733 --> 28:10.233
More out of respect
for her boyfriend.

28:10.300 --> 28:12.800
How I feel about
the whole situation is, erm,

28:12.867 --> 28:17.233
it was mutual and I don't have
any grudges about it, you know?

28:17.300 --> 28:20.933
And she lives on the other side.
She's at a different time from
mine.

28:21.000 --> 28:23.467
She's ready to move on
and I'm happy for her.

28:23.533 --> 28:25.733
Genuinely happy.
Know what that shows?

28:25.800 --> 28:28.533
That shows how much you've
matured.

28:28.600 --> 28:32.200
What Sophie and I had was fun.
She's
at a different stage in her
life.

28:32.267 --> 28:34.867
Happy she's found someone
to settle down with.

28:34.933 --> 28:37.800
I think once you've had a chat,
and say those things,

28:37.867 --> 28:39.867
I don't think there'll be a
problem

28:39.933 --> 28:42.600
cos I can tell that's genuine
and that's nice.

28:42.667 --> 28:44.833
I'm glad to hear Alex saying
these things

28:44.900 --> 28:47.467
cos it goes to show
he's not a little boy any more.

28:47.533 --> 28:49.633
He might have come back to this
a man.

28:49.700 --> 28:51.700
(grunting)

28:57.367 --> 29:00.400
(Sam) Come on then, ladies.
Hey, Beau!

29:01.400 --> 29:02.833
Sophie!

29:02.900 --> 29:06.967
We've got back from work. All I
wanna do is make sure Sophie's
OK.

29:07.033 --> 29:08.400
What you been up to?

29:08.467 --> 29:10.000
Erm...

29:10.067 --> 29:14.200
I mean, I'm not gonna lie, I've
had
a bit of an emotional
experience.

29:14.267 --> 29:17.433
My relationship is much more
important than...

29:17.500 --> 29:20.467
...than anything in this house.
I've found someone...

29:20.533 --> 29:24.233
You said, I'll find someone
that'll make us happy and I
have.

29:24.300 --> 29:25.700
I've finally found that.

29:25.767 --> 29:30.100
You know, it's Alex's first
night
back, I'm gonna come out
tonight.

29:30.167 --> 29:33.733
Thank fuck. For a minute,
I thought Sophie was gonna walk
out.

29:33.800 --> 29:35.433
I am so ready to get ready.

29:35.500 --> 29:37.733
Right, let's get ready for
tonight.

29:37.800 --> 29:39.267
(cheering)

29:39.333 --> 29:41.033
Alex is part of the family.

29:41.100 --> 29:43.800
We need to celebrate
his first night in the Toon.

29:43.867 --> 29:45.633
Not looking forward to it.

29:51.433 --> 29:54.300
You need to show Beau exactly
what Aussie Alex is like.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.100
Don't worry, you'll get...

29:56.167 --> 29:59.167
I haven't got high expectations,
mate. (laughs)

30:02.200 --> 30:05.100
Oh, Chloe, honestly, I just...

30:05.167 --> 30:08.333
My head was just so fried
when Alex walked through the
door.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.433
I'm not surprised.

30:09.500 --> 30:12.000
I do feel bad cos
I don't wanna be angry at Alex.

30:12.067 --> 30:14.467
I've got nothing to be angry
about.

30:14.533 --> 30:17.967
But it's still obviously
uncomfortable being in the
house...

30:18.033 --> 30:20.000
Which is obviously normal.

30:20.067 --> 30:21.167
I do feel for Sophie.

30:21.233 --> 30:24.900
Even before Alex arrived, she's
been
struggling without her lad.

30:24.967 --> 30:28.867
Me and Sam do have our problems.
I
couldn't imagine him not being
here.

30:30.133 --> 30:32.700
I just need to accept that Sam
isn't gonna hurt us

30:32.767 --> 30:36.000
and he's a very good boyfriend.
Good. Good on you, cos he is.

30:36.067 --> 30:38.167
To start fixing her
relationship,

30:38.233 --> 30:41.367
Chloe needs to put all the bad
stuff
with Sam behind her.

30:41.433 --> 30:44.333
He has changed so much this
time.
He's really matured.

30:44.400 --> 30:47.433
I always think that
I'm waiting for him to fuck up,
man.

30:47.500 --> 30:50.800
I need to stop doing it cos
it's making us fucking
depressed.

30:50.867 --> 30:52.067
It's pushing us away.

30:52.133 --> 30:55.000
Sam could do with being
a little bit more like Beau

30:55.067 --> 30:57.967
cos he's all over me
and I am loving the attention.

30:58.033 --> 31:01.100
Is he boyfriend material,
Bethan?
Yeah.

31:01.167 --> 31:02.400
Is he?! Why?

31:02.467 --> 31:04.200
I just... Oh, God.

31:04.267 --> 31:06.667
Oh, shit! I'm falling, aren't I?

31:06.733 --> 31:09.467
Oh, shit! Someone pick her up.
Someone pick her up.

31:09.533 --> 31:12.200
Fuck that. Can't be arsed.

31:14.233 --> 31:16.200
(spraying)

31:17.267 --> 31:18.267
(Nathan) Girls!

31:19.600 --> 31:21.967
Bring your fine asses
down the stairs!

31:22.033 --> 31:23.700
Gather round! Gather round!

31:28.833 --> 31:31.233
So, listen, ladies,
you're on a night out.

31:31.300 --> 31:34.233
Er, excuse me! I'm a boy!
Listen, ladies and Nathan.

31:34.300 --> 31:36.467
I'm head of security
and this is my team.

31:36.533 --> 31:38.133
(laughter)

31:38.200 --> 31:41.133
Youse! Cheers to Alex being
back!

31:41.200 --> 31:43.300
(cheering)

31:43.367 --> 31:46.033
Let's go to the fucking club!
(bangs table)

31:46.100 --> 31:48.400
I actually have to put myself
first.

31:48.467 --> 31:49.900
"I am so sorry..."

31:49.967 --> 31:52.267
This house is never gonna be
the same again.

31:52.333 --> 31:54.833
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:57.933 --> 31:58.133
.

32:00.667 --> 32:00.867
.

32:13.500 --> 32:17.533
We've all arrived at Tup Tup
and everyone's in such good
spirits.

32:17.600 --> 32:19.200
Nothing can ruin tonight.

32:28.433 --> 32:31.167
(all yelling)

32:31.233 --> 32:34.233
Tonight is our first night out
after Belfast,

32:34.300 --> 32:36.400
the perfect opportunity
to give Chloe

32:36.467 --> 32:38.733
the love and affection
she's asked for.

32:43.467 --> 32:45.567
(laughter)

32:45.633 --> 32:48.733
Still getting to know Alex,
but he does seem a bit of a
laugh.

32:48.800 --> 32:51.833
And it's just what we need
after the past couple of days.

32:53.467 --> 32:56.600
(club music)

33:00.433 --> 33:02.267
Oi-oi-oi!

33:08.500 --> 33:12.400
Alex seems nice but Beau is the
only lad that I'm thinking
about.

33:15.867 --> 33:17.467
(laughs)

33:21.433 --> 33:22.900
(laughs)

33:31.700 --> 33:34.067
I'll be honest,
I am starting to like Bethan.

33:34.133 --> 33:35.633
And I'm happy where it's at.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.833
But I am worried about it
going too fast.

33:52.333 --> 33:55.667
I'm so happy Sam is taking
everything on board since
Belfast.

33:55.733 --> 33:59.867
He is trying very hard and we
are
slowly getting back on track.

34:14.132 --> 34:17.632
I'm so glad that Chloe was
honest cos she means the world
to me

34:17.699 --> 34:19.800
and I'd do anything not to lose
her.

34:23.667 --> 34:25.333
(yelling)

34:27.533 --> 34:30.533
Alex isn't my usual type
but he does seem quite funny

34:30.600 --> 34:32.433
so I'm gonna have a little
flirt.

34:46.833 --> 34:49.233
I did really think
I could handle this.

34:49.300 --> 34:53.333
But every time I look at Alex,
all I can think about is Jay.

34:55.567 --> 34:57.900
(club music)

35:05.867 --> 35:08.567
Sophie and I have been
avoiding each other.

35:08.633 --> 35:11.967
So we need to have a chat
and see if everything's OK.

35:30.133 --> 35:32.433
Alex is taking this really well.

35:32.500 --> 35:36.100
But I can't help but imagine
how Jay would feel,

35:36.167 --> 35:39.567
knowing that I'm living
in the house with Alex.

35:45.667 --> 35:47.200
I hear what Sophie's saying

35:47.267 --> 35:49.867
but not my intention
to wreck her relationship.

35:49.933 --> 35:53.333
I'm just here to see the family
and live my best Newcastle life.

36:11.333 --> 36:14.633
Having a chat with Alex
has really helped clear my mind.

36:14.700 --> 36:18.233
He's not here to stir things up
and it's not his fault.

36:18.300 --> 36:22.700
But I just need to look after
number one... which is me.

36:24.233 --> 36:25.867
(club music)

36:47.600 --> 36:49.900
It must be difficult
being out with your ex.

36:49.967 --> 36:54.067
And I know Sophie. All she needs
to
do is go home and clear her
head.

36:54.133 --> 36:55.700
Tomorrow she'll be fine.

37:00.900 --> 37:04.033
I've just told the rest of the
guys
that I'm going home.

37:04.100 --> 37:07.200
But I'm not going back
to the house.

37:07.267 --> 37:09.833
I'm actually going home-home.
(sniffs)

37:09.900 --> 37:11.800
Home to Jay.

37:20.567 --> 37:23.767
I absolutely love the friends
I've made in this house...

37:24.667 --> 37:27.733
(sniffs)
...cos they're like my family.

37:27.800 --> 37:33.400
But for the first time in ages,
I actually have to put meself
first.

37:33.467 --> 37:37.100
Like, my relationship
is so important.

37:37.167 --> 37:38.200
(sniffs)

37:38.267 --> 37:41.733
And I just think the way
I've been feeling this time
round,

37:41.800 --> 37:45.500
I just think it's the right time
to pack me things up...

37:45.567 --> 37:46.600
...and walk away.

37:50.000 --> 37:52.833
I always find goodbyes so hard.

37:52.900 --> 37:55.700
So the only way I can say
goodbye
right now

37:55.767 --> 37:57.833
is through this pen and paper.

38:13.533 --> 38:15.333
We've all had a great night

38:15.400 --> 38:18.300
but it's time to go home
and see how Sophie's doing.

38:33.000 --> 38:38.067
I cannot put into words how
special
that house is to me. (sniffs)

38:38.133 --> 38:41.433
Like, all the friends
that I've made... the memories.

38:41.500 --> 38:45.300
The laughter, the tears. The
drama.

38:45.367 --> 38:49.100
It has just been
the most amazing time.

38:49.167 --> 38:54.467
But I just know deep in my
heart,
I am actually doing the right
thing.

38:54.533 --> 38:55.600
(groans)

39:18.300 --> 39:20.467
We've just got back to the house

39:20.533 --> 39:23.267
and all I wanna do is
check that Sophie's OK.

39:35.000 --> 39:36.033
Oh...

39:39.467 --> 39:40.933
What does it say?
Wait...

39:41.000 --> 39:42.367
What does it say?

39:42.433 --> 39:46.667
Oh, my God. I hope this doesn't
say
what I think it does.

39:46.733 --> 39:49.233
Yous, get round the table now.

39:51.267 --> 39:54.300
I've just come in...
and I've found this.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.667
What is it?

40:04.233 --> 40:05.767
"Hi, guys."

40:06.667 --> 40:09.233
"I'm so sorry, I couldn't..."

40:11.067 --> 40:13.100
"I couldn't say goodbye in
person."

40:14.033 --> 40:18.867
"I just knew it would be too
painful
to decide to leave this house."

40:18.933 --> 40:23.267
Is this actually happening?
I can't believe what I'm
hearing.

40:26.133 --> 40:30.033
"I never thought I would have
had
to choose between

40:30.100 --> 40:32.200
the two loves in my life."

40:32.267 --> 40:34.833
"My family and my relationship."

40:37.600 --> 40:42.833
"And I hope you all have
learned...
everything I taught you."

40:42.900 --> 40:46.133
"Cos I have learned from
everything
you have taught me."

40:48.033 --> 40:49.400
"Goodbye for now."

40:51.033 --> 40:52.467
"I love you all."

40:52.533 --> 40:55.533
"Love... Sophie."

40:58.433 --> 41:01.200
The very thought of Sophie
leaving this house

41:01.267 --> 41:03.700
makes me feel physically sick.

41:03.767 --> 41:07.500
Cos I can't bear to be here
without her. She is my rock.

41:07.567 --> 41:11.900
Mate, that is the best decision
she could have possibly made for
her.

41:11.967 --> 41:15.400
It's upsetting for you,
because you not got to see her
but...

41:15.467 --> 41:17.533
...for Sophie's sake.
Her interests.

41:17.600 --> 41:20.367
It might be hard for everybody
in the house to accept

41:20.433 --> 41:23.233
but Sophie has done
what is right for her.

41:23.300 --> 41:25.200
Give me five minutes.
OK.

41:25.267 --> 41:26.633
Give him a minute, Beau.

41:29.267 --> 41:30.500
(sniffs)

41:33.367 --> 41:34.900
(breathes deeply)

41:34.967 --> 41:37.267
(Nat) Sophie's been
going through hell.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.633
To be honest,
I don't blame her for leaving.

41:39.700 --> 41:41.400
But we are gonna really miss
her.

41:46.567 --> 41:50.600
Everyone's taken Sophie leaving
really badly.

41:50.667 --> 41:53.800
And it doesn't look great either
when I've just come back.

41:53.867 --> 41:55.733
So before people start blaming
me,

41:55.800 --> 41:57.733
I'm gonna go to bed,
keep my head down.

42:04.633 --> 42:07.500
I can't believe Sophie
has left the house forever.

42:13.233 --> 42:14.733
Emotions are high right now

42:14.800 --> 42:17.767
so me and Bethan are going off
for a cheeky cuddle.

42:27.533 --> 42:29.733
Sophie is my best friend.

42:29.800 --> 42:32.467
And me and her have been through
so much together.

42:32.533 --> 42:34.600
It hasn't even sank in
that she's gone.

42:34.667 --> 42:37.433
This house is never gonna
be the same again.

42:46.033 --> 42:50.300
It's time for me to go see
Sophie.
I need to find out what's going
on.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.533
I just think it was me time.

42:52.600 --> 42:54.967
I've been thinking
what I can do for Chloe...

42:55.033 --> 42:57.700
"You honestly make me so proud."
(cries)

42:57.767 --> 42:59.567
This is a fucking singles event.

42:59.633 --> 43:01.467
So would you like to give me a
kiss?

43:01.533 --> 43:03.567
Oh, my God! I'm necking on!

43:03.633 --> 43:05.767
Fancy us a little bit?
A little bit.

43:05.833 --> 43:08.467
Tahlia said her type
was tall, dark and handsome.

43:08.533 --> 43:11.767
Adam's small, orange and ginger.
Great. Abbie's here.

43:11.833 --> 43:14.600
Shame we're not necking on
this time. Shame.

43:14.667 --> 43:16.400
Bethan isn't gonna wanna hear.
