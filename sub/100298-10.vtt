<i>Previously on</i>
Party Of Five...

00:02.127 --> 00:04.046
‐You have kids at home too?
‐Not tonight.

00:04.046 --> 00:06.215
‐I'll show you mine
if you show me yours?
‐Deal.

00:06.215 --> 00:07.716
Valentina:
<i>How are we gonna</i>
<i>explain to them</i>

00:07.716 --> 00:09.134
<i>why we came all of a sudden?</i>

00:09.134 --> 00:11.845
I don't want Mami to know about
any of the Amanda stuff.

00:12.179 --> 00:15.224
Amanda, I can't.
Because I'm with my family.

00:15.224 --> 00:17.017
Yes, <i>mi amor.</i> I promise.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.852
I sent all these
voice messages and texts

00:18.852 --> 00:20.479
and I still haven't
heard anything back.

00:20.479 --> 00:21.855
She's playing games with you.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.815
If you don't already know
how I feel about you,

00:23.815 --> 00:24.900
<i>that's on you, Ella.</i>

00:24.900 --> 00:26.443
<i>I loved you</i>
<i>the best way I knew how.</i>

00:26.443 --> 00:28.570
Let me see the rules
for this songwriting contest.

00:28.570 --> 00:29.863
I told you,
I'm not interested.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.323
Not because we're gonna enter.

00:31.323 --> 00:32.658
It has to be a love song?

00:32.658 --> 00:34.701
<i>I've, uh, never</i>
<i>actually been in love.</i>

00:34.701 --> 00:36.703
Natalia:
<i>How can you write about</i>
<i>something you never felt?</i>

00:36.954 --> 00:38.997
You look sad.
Is it a boy?

00:41.583 --> 00:43.627
Yes... it's a boy.

00:43.627 --> 00:46.004
The way he looked at me
made me feel like...

00:46.004 --> 00:48.340
feel like I just...
she was just the key
that unlocked me

00:48.340 --> 00:50.384
like I‐I just opened up
somehow. I‐‐

00:50.384 --> 00:51.260
She?

00:51.260 --> 00:52.469
I‐I meant he.

00:54.429 --> 00:56.014
I meant he, Mami.

00:56.014 --> 00:57.140
I'm not going to church.

00:57.140 --> 00:59.643
(speaking Spanish)

01:02.771 --> 01:04.064
Are you and Mami okay?

01:04.064 --> 01:07.776
Your mother is the only woman
in this world for me.

01:08.944 --> 01:11.029
(speaking Spanish)

01:22.541 --> 01:23.917
It's just that
it's a new watch.

01:23.917 --> 01:26.086
And I didn't know
how to reach you
without turning up

01:26.086 --> 01:27.379
because we didn't
exchange numbers.

01:27.379 --> 01:28.714
Yeah. I'd offer you coffee

01:28.714 --> 01:30.048
but, uh, I have
an early appointment,

01:30.048 --> 01:32.134
It's okay. I got
what I came for.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.344
Uh, that came out wrong.

01:36.138 --> 01:38.473
I had a really nice time
with you the other night.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.475
‐Uh, yeah.
‐And thank you
for not appropriating

01:40.475 --> 01:41.810
my fancy‐schmancy watch.

01:41.810 --> 01:42.811
Mm...

01:43.395 --> 01:44.396
Bye.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.149
♪♪

01:48.525 --> 01:49.484
Hi.

01:49.818 --> 01:50.819
Hi.

01:51.236 --> 01:52.070
Hi.

01:54.197 --> 01:56.366
‐Well, uh, bye.
‐Yeah, bye.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.451
Bye.

02:01.997 --> 02:04.374
Well I, for one, did
my homework last night.

02:05.167 --> 02:06.251
Did you?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.672
Uh, I didn't sleep
with that woman last night.

02:11.423 --> 02:13.091
Look, it's okay if you did.

02:13.091 --> 02:14.635
No, no, no. But I‐I didn't.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.221
I slept with her
a couple nights ago.

02:18.805 --> 02:19.848
But not last night.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.808
What difference does it make?

02:21.808 --> 02:23.810
Well, I just don't
want you to think that

02:23.810 --> 02:26.146
after you and I
had that moment and...

02:26.605 --> 02:27.981
Well, that I went out
and hooked up.

02:28.607 --> 02:30.275
Emilio. We're not a couple.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.735
You're allowed to have
a private life.

02:33.445 --> 02:34.529
Right. Yeah.

02:34.529 --> 02:36.531
So you need a few more
minutes or what?

02:36.531 --> 02:37.658
'Cause I'm ready to get started.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.166
Beto:
She's never not wanted
to go to church.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.001
Is it that she feels guilty?

02:48.001 --> 02:49.753
What does she have
to feel guilty for?

02:50.212 --> 02:52.381
That girl she takes care of.

02:52.381 --> 02:53.215
Javier:
No.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.593
No, it's not that,
my love. No.

02:56.593 --> 02:58.261
I'd be glad...

02:58.261 --> 03:00.514
if Amanda was the reason.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.142
I'd be glad if she realized
what she's done.

03:04.142 --> 03:05.644
She replaced me.

03:06.269 --> 03:08.897
What? Oh no, Val.
She didn't.

03:09.314 --> 03:11.817
You see, your mother,
she's struggling.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.528
She's lost the most
important things in her life.

03:15.904 --> 03:17.406
But doesn't she have you?

03:22.994 --> 03:24.663
Lucia:
Why can't you go to church?

03:26.081 --> 03:27.290
Is it because of me?

03:29.543 --> 03:31.378
Because I haven't sinned,
I want you to know

03:31.378 --> 03:32.921
that I haven't been
with anyone ever.

03:33.338 --> 03:35.340
It's not because of you.
It's...

03:38.135 --> 03:39.261
I‐I can't.

03:39.261 --> 03:40.470
I...

03:41.763 --> 03:42.639
I can't...

03:43.598 --> 03:45.225
face God after what I've done.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.477
What you've done?

03:48.728 --> 03:49.688
I failed you.

03:53.483 --> 03:54.568
You needed me.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.319
Your sister needed me.
Rafa...

03:57.154 --> 04:00.657
I didn't realize how much
you were drifting away.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.993
‐Maybe if I had‐‐
‐Then what?

04:04.995 --> 04:06.580
I wouldn't be this way?

04:08.832 --> 04:10.959
I'm not any way, Mami.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.754
I‐I haven't done anything.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.965
Don't say it's your fault
when nothing has happened.

04:17.757 --> 04:19.551
Nothing has happened?

04:20.093 --> 04:21.761
Everything feels so different.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.808
None of us is who
we were before...

04:27.392 --> 04:30.437
and I didn't stop that
from happening.
That was my job.

04:33.648 --> 04:35.233
And now I think it's too late.

04:35.859 --> 04:37.652
It's too late
to make things right.

04:38.820 --> 04:40.155
It's not too late.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.327
It's not too late, Mami.

I told you, pal.

07:09.512 --> 07:11.348
'Til the kids come back,
you're off the clock.

07:11.348 --> 07:13.350
‐I got your take‐out, man.
‐Thanks.

07:14.643 --> 07:16.895
See? I came back
for provisions.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.481
I've been holed up,
workin' on some new music.

07:19.481 --> 07:20.857
So you're a solo act now?

07:20.857 --> 07:22.942
Actually, no, I've been
collaborating with Natalia.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.236
Don't give me
that look, alright?

07:25.236 --> 07:26.321
It's entirely professional.

07:27.322 --> 07:29.366
I'm serious, man.
I've learned my lesson.

07:29.908 --> 07:30.950
Boundaries.

07:30.950 --> 07:32.202
Plus, she's great with Rafa.

07:32.202 --> 07:33.995
You know, and I don't
wanna mess that up
by messing around.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.206
So, you're not her type, huh?

07:36.623 --> 07:37.957
I can't tell, man.

07:37.957 --> 07:38.833
(laughter)

Emilio.

Ah, Mr. Nichols.

07:41.961 --> 07:44.339
Um, I dropped by your house,
but there was no answer.

07:44.881 --> 07:46.466
You must have just missed me.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.010
We received a report your sister
Valentina was apprehended

07:49.010 --> 07:50.887
by border authorities
two days ago.

07:50.887 --> 07:52.055
Trying to cross into Mexico.

07:52.055 --> 07:54.182
Apprehended? That makes it sound
so much worse than it was.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.975
Well, the report indicates
she ran away from home.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.729
No. No, no, look.
Her and I got into
a little argument.

07:59.729 --> 08:01.189
‐And yeah‐‐
‐I'd like to speak to her.

08:02.107 --> 08:05.318
Okay. Uh, well, she's with
my parents right now.

08:07.779 --> 08:09.572
‐In Mexico.
‐Unaccompanied?

08:09.572 --> 08:11.741
Of course not.
Beto and Lucia are with her.

08:13.243 --> 08:14.369
Rafa too...

08:15.912 --> 08:17.288
You expect them back when?

08:18.331 --> 08:20.208
Soon?
In the next couple of days.

08:20.834 --> 08:22.919
Uh, we just haven't booked
their return ticket yet.

08:24.796 --> 08:25.964
Well, perhaps you better.

♪♪

08:34.180 --> 08:36.099
Hey, sorry to bother you.

08:36.099 --> 08:38.268
Um, there's just something
wrong with our TV.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.103
(speaking Spanish)

08:41.354 --> 08:43.940
Yeah...
<i>televisor es malo.</i>

08:43.940 --> 08:45.442
And it just keeps
cutting in and out.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.943
It's like...
(imitating static)

08:46.943 --> 08:48.319
And we're just trying
to watch a movie.

08:48.319 --> 08:50.155
(speaking Spanish)

08:56.202 --> 08:57.037
Ella?

08:58.747 --> 09:02.083
‐What are you‐‐
‐Well, well you turned off
your phone. Remember?

09:02.083 --> 09:04.419
(stammers)
And I had to make sure
that you were okay.

09:04.419 --> 09:06.629
That‐‐ that we were okay.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.466
Because that was a pretty
horrible goodbye.

09:09.466 --> 09:12.927
And, yes, I was trying to
punish you when I should
have been happy for you.

09:12.927 --> 09:14.637
That you finally get
to see your parents.

09:17.307 --> 09:19.434
You came all this way
just to say that?

09:19.976 --> 09:22.395
It felt like something
I needed to prove to you.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.566
That's...

09:28.151 --> 09:29.235
I mean...

09:33.656 --> 09:37.077
Okay... So, uh,
if we're good

09:37.077 --> 09:38.995
then I'll see you
back at home.

09:40.038 --> 09:43.333
Whoa, whoa, wait.
That's... that's really it?

09:44.459 --> 09:45.627
Just gonna turn around
and take another

09:45.627 --> 09:47.879
12 hour bus ride
back to Los Angeles?

09:48.505 --> 09:49.339
Wow.

09:50.799 --> 09:52.383
So we're gonna be
100 percent honest

09:52.383 --> 09:54.260
with each other
from now on, right?

09:56.471 --> 09:58.473
It's not as much
of a wow as you think.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.808
For a couple of hundred bucks,

09:59.808 --> 10:02.310
you can get a direct flight
from LAX.

10:02.310 --> 10:05.271
But I so would have been
willing to take a bus.

10:06.815 --> 10:08.233
That totally counts.

10:09.984 --> 10:11.194
I missed you.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.572
The last flight back
leaves in 90 minutes, so...

10:15.990 --> 10:16.991
Um...

10:18.660 --> 10:20.161
What if you got
a room tonight?

10:20.995 --> 10:21.871
And left in the morning?

10:23.081 --> 10:24.749
We're all watching
a movie together,

10:24.749 --> 10:26.668
but I'm sure I can
sneak away at some point.

10:32.340 --> 10:34.717
Well, definitely
it's not the TV set.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.845
Lucia:
Well the sign outside
says free cable

10:36.845 --> 10:38.555
so they should
give us a discount.

10:39.472 --> 10:41.724
Well, maybe we should
call it a night, <i>chiquita.</i>

10:41.724 --> 10:43.768
But Mami promised me
a movie.

10:43.768 --> 10:45.770
Yeah, let's not give up
so quickly.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.022
I'm sure Beto will find
someone to fix it.

10:48.022 --> 10:51.317
Do you really need
to see the <i>Wizard of Oz</i>
for the 1000th time?

10:52.026 --> 10:53.069
(mouthing)

10:53.653 --> 10:55.238
Besides, it's getting late.

10:55.238 --> 10:56.156
(phone ringing)

10:56.156 --> 10:59.701
Oh. Probably is Beto
from the lobby. Yes?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.828
No, it's me, Papi.

11:02.829 --> 11:03.663
I tried your cell.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.081
Eh, it's Emilio.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.834
There's no Wi‐Fi in the rooms.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.961
And no TV!

11:09.961 --> 11:12.338
We were hoping to have
a movie night, but...

11:12.797 --> 11:14.132
So far it's not working out.

11:14.299 --> 11:16.050
What about you?
What are you doing tonight?

11:16.050 --> 11:17.886
I went ahead and booked
their bus tickets back.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.638
For the day after tomorrow.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.056
No, so soon.

11:22.056 --> 11:23.224
What's so soon?

11:23.224 --> 11:24.392
Gloria:
The day after tomorrow.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.269
I was hoping for
more days than that.

11:26.269 --> 11:27.937
Javier:
At least until the weekend.

11:27.937 --> 11:30.273
Honestly, I don't know
how much more school
they can miss.

11:30.273 --> 11:33.401
Why does Emilio get to say
how long we can stay?

11:33.401 --> 11:35.361
<i>Mi amor</i> , he's worried
about your school.

11:35.361 --> 11:38.072
Tell him I can easily make up
any work I'm missing.

11:38.072 --> 11:40.533
Gloria:
<i>Mi amor</i> , are you
absolutely sure

11:40.533 --> 11:41.701
they can't have
an extra day?

11:41.701 --> 11:44.037
The guy at the front desk
said that, um,

11:44.037 --> 11:46.664
it's definitely
a cable issue.

11:47.123 --> 11:48.416
And it happens a lot.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.710
Hopefully they have
the system up by
tomorrow morning

11:50.710 --> 11:53.463
but no point in waiting
to see if it fixes itself, so...

11:54.255 --> 11:56.966
I thought that guy
didn't speak English.
How'd you get all that?

11:58.134 --> 12:00.136
Oh, well,
mostly hand gestures.

12:02.347 --> 12:04.766
So I guess we should
call it a night, huh?

12:07.310 --> 12:08.686
‐Gloria: Mm‐hmm.
‐What'd I miss?

12:08.686 --> 12:10.647
Emilio booked us
tickets back home.

12:10.647 --> 12:12.357
‐Beto: For when?
‐Day after tomorrow.

12:12.357 --> 12:13.816
‐Gloria: Couldn't you
talk to the school?
‐Beto: Why?

12:13.816 --> 12:15.860
<i>Mi amor</i> , no. Wait.
Where are you going?

12:15.860 --> 12:17.320
We can still find
something fun to do.

12:17.320 --> 12:18.321
I'm going to bed.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.824
Well then, I'm gonna
get some air.

12:21.824 --> 12:22.700
No, but‐‐

12:22.700 --> 12:24.077
Then, Imma go for a walk.

12:25.954 --> 12:26.996
(door slams)

12:28.831 --> 12:29.874
The kids are comin' home?

12:30.541 --> 12:31.501
Already?

12:32.835 --> 12:34.128
It never occurred to me

12:34.128 --> 12:35.296
that I should have
cleared the trip

12:35.296 --> 12:36.506
with social services.

12:37.131 --> 12:39.467
Now our case worker says
he has to make another report.

12:39.968 --> 12:42.095
And there can be truancy
issues with the kids and...

12:42.679 --> 12:43.972
who knows?

12:43.972 --> 12:45.848
Maybe the fight
at the fundraiser's
gonna come up.

12:45.848 --> 12:48.059
Why would it?
No one filed any charges.

12:48.059 --> 12:50.603
Doesn't matter, Oscar.
There's an incident report.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.273
Now this guy says
that I have to attend
a parenting class

12:53.273 --> 12:55.066
because I have to
demonstrate a willingness

12:55.066 --> 12:56.693
to work on my shortcomings.

12:58.653 --> 12:59.821
A parenting class.

13:01.823 --> 13:03.992
I had two days to myself.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.869
Two days where I didn't
have to worry about them.

13:09.831 --> 13:11.082
Guess I don't even
get that, huh?

13:18.298 --> 13:19.799
Ella:
<i>Disappointing how?</i>

13:21.551 --> 13:23.303
I feel terrible
even saying it.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.305
It's like we're all acting.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.725
As if everything is the way
it was before, and it's not.

13:30.560 --> 13:32.770

There's no way
you can stay, is there?

15:58.249 --> 15:59.709
I mean, what are you
missing at home?

16:01.085 --> 16:03.754
Just the sound of my parents
raging at each other.

16:04.422 --> 16:06.340
They're so busy
fighting over custody

16:06.340 --> 16:09.010

noticed I was even gone.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.013

16:17.310 --> 16:18.394
Probably not.

Unless...

16:24.692 --> 16:25.735

19:22.244 --> 19:24.038
We didn't have one
for Luce.

19:24.038 --> 19:26.374
She says that <i>quinces</i>
are sexist rituals

19:26.374 --> 19:28.876
and that wearing dresses
make her feel claustrophobic.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.960

19:29.960 --> 19:31.295
Hoping Val feels the same way

have to learn to waltz.

19:34.298 --> 19:35.299
Let's check it out.

19:36.300 --> 19:37.343
Really?

19:39.428 --> 19:41.180
Look, wedding gowns.

19:41.931 --> 19:44.058
Can't really see you
in that many sequins.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.269
Doesn't everyone look back
at their wedding pictures
and think,

19:47.269 --> 19:49.689
"Oh my God, WTF?"

19:50.147 --> 19:51.857
So why not like...

19:51.857 --> 19:54.527
lean into wearing something
freaky to begin with.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.781
So you're saying I should
go with the top hat?

20:00.032 --> 20:01.409
Definitely.

20:02.993 --> 20:05.830
My parents actually
looked like themselves
in their wedding picture.

20:05.830 --> 20:08.457
‐Picture? Just one?
‐That's all they got.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.293
My dad carries it in his wallet
all creased and banged up.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.796
My mom was, God, so young.

20:13.796 --> 20:14.964
How young?

20:14.964 --> 20:17.091
You know, our age basically.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.137
Seems way too young
to be so sure about
something that important.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.181
Maybe she wasn't sure. Maybe...

20:24.807 --> 20:26.600
She was doing what
felt right in the moment

20:26.600 --> 20:28.269
and then those moments
started adding up

20:28.269 --> 20:30.563
until she couldn't remember
a time she wasn't certain.

20:32.606 --> 20:36.360
I think deciding who
you're gonna marry is basically

20:36.360 --> 20:39.488
just picking someone
you feel good about
jumping off a cliff with.

20:40.322 --> 20:43.033
I mean, there's a reason
they call it taking the plunge.

20:43.826 --> 20:46.662
Hey, isn't it bad luck
to see the bride
before the ceremony?

20:48.497 --> 20:50.166
I don't believe in bad luck.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.045
(dog barking)

20:59.300 --> 21:00.468
Oh...

21:02.261 --> 21:04.805
You maybe wanna help
with the sunscreen?

21:05.598 --> 21:08.517
Do you want to tell me
how your passport

21:08.517 --> 21:11.145
ended up in a dumpster
in the parking lot?

21:14.064 --> 21:15.149
Huh?

21:15.149 --> 21:17.151
One of the housekeepers
found it.

21:17.151 --> 21:19.820
We couldn't send you back
without your passport.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.989
You'd have to stay with us

21:21.989 --> 21:24.658
while we apply
for a replacement.

21:25.159 --> 21:26.911
Is that what you were thinking?

21:27.286 --> 21:30.289
The day after tomorrow
is not enough time.

21:30.790 --> 21:32.374
I'm mad at Mami.

21:32.374 --> 21:34.418
And there's not enough time
to get over that

21:34.418 --> 21:36.045
before I have to
get on that bus.

21:36.420 --> 21:38.798
What good was this visit
if I have to go back

21:38.798 --> 21:41.634
feeling just as bad
as I was when I got here?

21:43.636 --> 21:45.638
Why do I have to go
back at all, Papi?

21:47.264 --> 21:48.974
You know why, Valentina.

21:49.850 --> 21:52.812
Because if we stay any longer,
we're gonna get in trouble

21:52.812 --> 21:55.773
in the country
that's made the worst
kind of trouble for us.

21:56.232 --> 21:58.442
That said we don't
belong together.

21:59.109 --> 22:01.862
Well, no one in Mexico
is saying that.

22:01.862 --> 22:04.240
We could be together. Here.

22:05.157 --> 22:08.035
If not all of us,
then Rafa and me.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.579
Maybe not forever, but for now.

22:12.498 --> 22:13.833
Why can't we, Papi?

22:18.963 --> 22:21.048
Fred:
<i>The truth is, I knew.</i>

22:21.048 --> 22:23.259
Even before my daughter
got in the car, that I...

22:24.009 --> 22:26.720
that I shouldn't be
behind the wheel
after that many beers.

22:26.720 --> 22:27.721
So...

22:29.598 --> 22:31.767

we hope to work on in here?

22:31.767 --> 22:32.768
Mm‐hmm.

‐Emilio‐‐
‐What do you want me to do?!

25:39.621 --> 25:41.790
I think now, your best option

25:41.790 --> 25:43.417
is to simply let
the process play out.

25:44.126 --> 25:46.628
There will be another
evaluation of your fitness.

25:46.628 --> 25:47.838
Right.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.006
By you?

25:50.174 --> 25:51.383
No.

25:51.383 --> 25:52.468
It's gone up the ladder.

25:52.468 --> 25:54.219
To the juvenile
dependency court.

25:55.345 --> 25:57.931
Who will determine
whether or not
any kind of...

25:58.724 --> 26:00.100
intervention is warranted.

26:00.434 --> 26:01.268
Intervention?

26:02.728 --> 26:04.354
I'm sorry, what are we
talking about here?

26:04.938 --> 26:07.357
That little girl has already
lost her parents, okay?

26:07.357 --> 26:08.567
And some court's gonna decide

26:08.567 --> 26:10.736
because she's upset about that,
she might lose me too?!

26:12.529 --> 26:14.156
I mean, how is that
determined exactly?

26:15.908 --> 26:18.327
They'll wanna interview
your siblings when they return.

26:18.327 --> 26:19.828
Okay, fine. Yeah.

26:19.828 --> 26:21.330
Beto and Lucia
can talk to them‐‐

26:21.330 --> 26:22.623
Valentina, too.

26:23.415 --> 26:26.460
Obviously her testimony
will carry the most weight.

26:30.130 --> 26:32.091
I don't want that.
No. No. Mm‐mm.

26:32.966 --> 26:34.426
You worried about
what she'd say?

26:34.426 --> 26:36.178
You don't think
she'd defend you?

26:37.805 --> 26:39.139
No, of course she would.

26:39.807 --> 26:42.309
Then I‐I don't understand.
What's the problem?

26:44.978 --> 26:47.314
‐Beto: I can't believe
you asked them.
‐Lucia: What did she say?

26:47.314 --> 26:49.817
She said she needed
to talk it over with Papi.

26:49.817 --> 26:51.068
Which means
she's gonna say no.

26:51.068 --> 26:52.569
How do you know?

26:52.569 --> 26:53.987
You don't say you need
to think about something

26:53.987 --> 26:55.572
you're gonna say yes to.

26:55.572 --> 26:56.657
You just say yes.

26:57.491 --> 26:59.827
I don't understand what
she needs to think about.

27:00.619 --> 27:01.620

27:51.753 --> 27:53.797
You could help convince her.

27:53.797 --> 27:55.424
Tell her that it'd be
easier for all of us.

27:55.424 --> 27:56.508
I'm not sure that's true.

27:56.508 --> 27:57.634
Of course it is.

27:57.968 --> 28:00.095
Think about how much easier
your lives could be

28:00.095 --> 28:01.638
if you didn't have to
take care of Rafa and me.

28:01.638 --> 28:04.933
It's not about us, Val.
You have to think about
what it means for them.

28:04.933 --> 28:06.435
Uh, I mean, right?!

28:06.435 --> 28:08.437
Yeah, they'd have
to find a bigger place

28:08.437 --> 28:10.314
which is gonna cost more.

28:10.314 --> 28:11.857
(exhales)
And Mami would have
to quit her job

28:11.857 --> 28:13.859
so she can stay home
and take care of
you and Rafa.

28:14.151 --> 28:16.695
I guess we all know why
you'd find that appealing.

28:16.987 --> 28:19.740
Hey! Both of you guys
had parents

28:19.740 --> 28:21.575
four years longer
than I did.

28:21.992 --> 28:24.411
And Rafa had them
for less than a year.

28:24.411 --> 28:26.496
It's only fair that we
should get to catch up.

28:26.496 --> 28:29.499
No matter how big the sacrifice
you're asking them to make?

28:29.499 --> 28:32.711
I don't think they consider
being with their children
a sacrifice.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.463
Then why didn't Mami
say yes right away?

28:34.463 --> 28:35.422
Well, listen, you two‐‐

28:35.422 --> 28:36.715
Lucia doesn't understand

28:36.715 --> 28:38.258
because she doesn't
need a mother
the same way I do.

28:38.258 --> 28:40.260
What does that mean?!
Of course I do!

28:40.260 --> 28:42.220
No, not to show you
how to be.

28:42.220 --> 28:43.889
Because you're not like Mami.

28:44.556 --> 28:45.849
You never have been.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.851
I'm not saying
it's your fault.

28:47.851 --> 28:50.020
Maybe something got
mixed up in the womb

28:50.020 --> 28:51.563
and Beto got all
the girl qualities

28:51.563 --> 28:52.981
and you got all the boy ones.

28:52.981 --> 28:54.816
Okay. Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I have boy qualities.

28:54.816 --> 28:56.360
I have plenty of boy qualities.

28:56.860 --> 28:59.821
That is‐‐ God,
a terrible thing to say.

28:59.821 --> 29:01.073
But it's true.

29:01.490 --> 29:03.533
Beto's the one
who will snuggle.

29:03.533 --> 29:06.161
Braid my hair.
Buy me a bra.

29:06.536 --> 29:08.872
And you never wanted
to play dolls with me.

29:08.872 --> 29:11.875
Or cook.
Or talk about makeup
or anything.

29:13.126 --> 29:14.753
So maybe that's why
you can't understand

29:14.753 --> 29:16.421
why it's so important
to me to be with someone

29:16.421 --> 29:18.882
who's gonna teach me
how to be a woman.

29:48.495 --> 29:51.832

at home, because it serves me?

save our marriage.

39:26.030 --> 39:29.158
I tried, but I couldn't do it.

39:29.325 --> 39:30.827
Right. No, yeah. Of course.

39:34.831 --> 39:35.748
<i>Are you mad?</i>

39:38.751 --> 39:39.752
I'm not mad.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.547
I don't want you to think
it's because of something

39:42.547 --> 39:44.007
you did or didn't do.

39:47.343 --> 39:48.970
Well, maybe that's
a little true, isn't it?

39:48.970 --> 39:52.473
<i>No. Don't say that.</i>
<i>It's not your fault.</i>

39:53.725 --> 39:56.853
I know how much you did for us
and how much you gave up.

40:00.982 --> 40:01.816
I don't mind.

40:02.191 --> 40:04.402
<i>You should be a father</i>
<i>when it's your choice.</i>

40:04.402 --> 40:07.196
<i>And you're gonna be</i>
<i>great at it.</i>

40:07.697 --> 40:09.324
I just know
in your whole life

40:09.324 --> 40:11.367
it's gonna be the thing
that you're best at.

40:13.494 --> 40:14.704
<i>But when the time's right.</i>

40:17.790 --> 40:18.833
Now, um...

40:20.084 --> 40:21.586
What'd you wanna say to me?

40:26.466 --> 40:28.927
It was quite a surprise
to realize that

40:28.927 --> 40:31.387
you were sitting
behind us in that diner.

40:31.387 --> 40:33.389
I guess you didn't understand
a word that we were saying

40:33.389 --> 40:35.141
because we were
speaking Spanish.

40:35.141 --> 40:36.643
Beto:
Uh, she didn't hear
a word, Mami.

40:36.643 --> 40:37.602
Not a word.

40:38.144 --> 40:40.855
You didn't need
to hide her way, Beto.

40:40.855 --> 40:42.315
You could have said something.

40:42.315 --> 40:45.234
Ella:
I didn't want you to think
less of me for intruding, sir.

40:46.402 --> 40:49.989
Mm. I, for one, believe in,
how do you say it?

40:49.989 --> 40:51.741
Mm...
(speaking Spanish)

40:51.741 --> 40:52.992
A grand gesture.

40:52.992 --> 40:54.744
Valentina:
Papi proposed to Mami
by threatening

40:54.744 --> 40:56.663
to jump off a bridge
if she didn't say yes.

40:56.663 --> 40:57.997
(laughter)

40:57.997 --> 41:00.917
Actually it was a scaffolding.
Like 20 feet high.

41:00.917 --> 41:03.461
I don't know how
is that a bridge now.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.339
People in love do crazy
things, don't they?

41:07.006 --> 41:08.549
Well, case in point.

41:09.550 --> 41:11.636
Let's toast, shall we?

41:12.929 --> 41:14.055
Welcome.

41:14.764 --> 41:15.848
What, my love?

41:17.600 --> 41:19.852
Uh, nothing. It's just warm.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.402
You don't like her
very much, do you?

41:28.486 --> 41:29.320
Ella?

41:30.822 --> 41:31.656
She's okay.

41:32.657 --> 41:34.158
Uh, she loves him.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.869
And she needs to be
taken care of which is...

41:36.869 --> 41:39.080
exactly what
he's good at doing.

41:39.080 --> 41:42.709
So... guess that makes them
a perfect match.

41:43.251 --> 41:44.168
She has Beto.

41:44.961 --> 41:46.254
Who's gonna take care of you?

41:46.963 --> 41:49.465
I don't need anyone.
I'm gonna be okay.

41:51.676 --> 41:54.595
You know, I've been
thinking about that woman.

41:54.595 --> 41:56.764
The one from
the organization of yours...

41:58.182 --> 42:00.768
who you've spoken of
with such affection.

42:02.687 --> 42:05.273
Sully? What about her?

42:07.316 --> 42:09.444
Sounds like someone
who's on your corner.

42:09.444 --> 42:11.529
Someone you can turn to
if you're struggling.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.241
Someone who's
been in the world
more than... me.

42:15.241 --> 42:16.993
That can give you advice.

42:16.993 --> 42:17.994
Right.

42:19.203 --> 42:22.040
Good idea.
Uh, I'll keep that in mind.

42:22.874 --> 42:24.000
Look.

42:27.712 --> 42:29.714
Would you be okay
if I went home tonight?

42:30.214 --> 42:32.842
Tonight?
You wanna leave early?

42:33.426 --> 42:35.595
That way I can sleep
on the bus.

42:36.888 --> 42:40.016
Otherwise, it's a 12‐hour
ride back with Beto and Ella.

42:40.016 --> 42:43.269
And she talks a lot.
Like a lot, a lot.

42:43.269 --> 42:46.314
It's just that I don't wanna
lose time with you. I hate it.

42:46.814 --> 42:48.149
It's so little as it is.

42:49.150 --> 42:49.984
Please?

42:54.405 --> 42:56.991
As long as you're going home
and not running away?

42:59.952 --> 43:02.663
Lucia, I'm not a very
sophisticated woman.

43:02.663 --> 43:03.998
I know.

43:03.998 --> 43:07.627
I‐I I want to be
open minded about ce‐‐

43:08.044 --> 43:08.878
Certain things.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.339
But it's not easy
when you've been taught

43:11.339 --> 43:12.924
to believe something
your whole life.

43:12.924 --> 43:15.343
Please don't explain, Mami.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.595
No, but I want you
to know this.

43:18.429 --> 43:19.764
Hey. Look at me.

43:20.348 --> 43:21.516
Look at me.

43:25.353 --> 43:27.188
There's nothing
you could ever do...

43:28.856 --> 43:30.525
No way you could ever be...

43:32.276 --> 43:34.403
No one you could...
ever love

43:34.403 --> 43:36.280
that would make me
love you any less.

43:37.824 --> 43:41.369
You will always,
always be my child.

43:43.454 --> 43:44.705
<i>Mi</i> Lucia.

43:52.547 --> 43:54.632
Totally ridiculous
Oscar calling you.

43:55.133 --> 43:57.635
I would have taken an Uber.
What does he think?

43:57.635 --> 43:58.803
You know the kids are gone,

43:58.803 --> 43:59.929
all of a sudden
I've got a death wish?

43:59.929 --> 44:02.140
He doesn't think that.
He's concerned is all.

44:03.099 --> 44:04.225
Do I need to take your keys

44:04.225 --> 44:05.518
to make sure
you don't go anywhere?

44:05.518 --> 44:06.394
Mm‐mm.

44:06.394 --> 44:08.062
Do you need help upstairs?

44:08.062 --> 44:09.564
No. I'll be fine.

44:09.981 --> 44:11.065
In that case...

44:17.113 --> 44:19.490
What do I do now, Natalia?

44:21.617 --> 44:24.662
I would hydrate
and take some aspirin.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.125
Oh, you mean that.

44:30.710 --> 44:34.130
Why don't you ask yourself
that tomorrow morning?

44:35.131 --> 44:36.048
That's my plan.

44:36.883 --> 44:38.467
Out of a job
now, remember?

44:38.467 --> 44:40.136
Why even get up tomorrow?

44:40.136 --> 44:43.222
To open up a restaurant
I was running to support kids
I don't have?

44:43.222 --> 44:44.974
The other kids still need you.

44:44.974 --> 44:45.808
No, not the same way.

44:46.267 --> 44:48.728
What can I do for them
they can't already do
for themselves?

44:50.605 --> 44:52.148
But Rafa and Val...

44:56.402 --> 44:58.613
You know, I used to complain

44:58.613 --> 45:01.490
that the deportation totally
derailed my life.

45:04.577 --> 45:06.287
And what if the truth is...

45:08.039 --> 45:12.084
taking care of those kids
actually gave me... a life.

45:15.838 --> 45:17.757
Your life is not over, Emilio.
