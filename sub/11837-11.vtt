00:22.122 --> 00:23.123
What's his name?
Get off of me!

00:23.156 --> 00:23.924
I didn't do anything!

00:23.957 --> 00:26.593

00:27.894 --> 00:29.095
Get the hell off me!
OFFICER: Where's your buddy?

00:29.129 --> 00:30.496

01:14.147 --> 01:15.816
We got one in custody

01:15.849 --> 01:18.752

01:18.785 --> 01:20.420

01:29.095 --> 01:30.163
Go look for it!

01:30.196 --> 01:31.732
Right. You guys heard him.
Split up.

01:31.765 --> 01:33.600
Martinez,
you and Davis take the alley.

01:33.634 --> 01:34.367
OFFICER: Let's go.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.669
Now, look everywhere.

01:38.505 --> 01:41.441
(music playing)

02:18.985 --> 02:20.954
How late are you
going to stay?

02:20.987 --> 02:22.589
I can't study at home.

02:22.623 --> 02:24.357
STRINGER:
How about sleeping at home?

02:24.390 --> 02:26.326
It's almost 11:00.
Uh-huh.

02:26.359 --> 02:27.628
I--I'm almost done.

02:28.695 --> 02:30.330
(telephone rings)

02:34.034 --> 02:35.235
Hello.
MORAN: Hello. Yes,

02:35.268 --> 02:37.203
I need to speak
with Jimmy Berluti.

02:37.237 --> 02:38.471
Mr. Berluti isn't here
at the moment.

02:38.505 --> 02:40.340
Our office hours--
You have to find him.

02:40.373 --> 02:41.107
This is an emergency.
Page him.

02:41.141 --> 02:42.108
Who are you, sir?

02:42.142 --> 02:44.044
My name is Joe Moran.
He knows me.

02:44.077 --> 02:45.411
The police are torturing
a friend of mine,

02:45.445 --> 02:47.147
I--and I need to get a lawyer
down here right now.

02:47.180 --> 02:48.549
Hold on.
No. No. I can't hold on.

02:48.582 --> 02:50.751
They got him in a room
and he's been shot.

02:50.784 --> 02:52.085
Who--who's been shot?

02:52.118 --> 02:53.086
MORAN (over phone): My friend.

02:53.119 --> 02:54.855
The police think
that he shot a cop.

02:54.888 --> 02:55.889
Now they got him in a room.

02:55.922 --> 02:57.190
We're at Brookridge Hospital.

02:57.223 --> 02:58.825
They threw the doctors out
and now he's screaming.

02:58.859 --> 02:59.960
All right, wait--
MORAN: No. No. No.

02:59.993 --> 03:01.101
Find Jimmy Berluti.

03:01.134 --> 03:01.835
I'm gonna put you on

03:01.868 --> 03:03.069
with Jamie Stringer.

03:03.103 --> 03:04.705
She is a fine lawyer
and she's very anxious

03:04.738 --> 03:05.839
to speak with you.
MORAN (over phone): No.

03:05.872 --> 03:06.840
I want Jimmy.
WILSON: Hold on, sir.

03:08.842 --> 03:11.778
BECK: (screaming)

03:13.013 --> 03:14.915
Jamie Stringer.
How can I help you?

03:16.216 --> 03:17.483
You just had
to fob it off on me.

03:17.518 --> 03:19.653
I'm not a member of the bar.
Oh, midnight.

03:19.686 --> 03:20.954
You were a member
of the bar last week

03:20.987 --> 03:22.689
to laugh at that Chinese guy.

03:22.723 --> 03:24.224
Keep paging Jimmy.

03:24.257 --> 03:26.627
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. McJoe to neonatology.

03:26.660 --> 03:28.261
Dr. McJoe to neonatology.

03:28.294 --> 03:29.730
MORAN: Excuse me,
are you Ms. Stringer?

03:29.763 --> 03:30.664
STRINGER: Joe?
Yeah.

03:30.697 --> 03:31.431
They have him back here.

03:31.464 --> 03:32.298
(elevator bell dings)

03:33.433 --> 03:34.635
They're gonna kill him.
I swear to God.

03:34.668 --> 03:36.236
STRINGER: Wait, before--
They think he shot a cop,

03:36.269 --> 03:37.170
but he didn't.

03:37.203 --> 03:38.739
BECK: (screams)

03:38.772 --> 03:39.640
That's him screaming.

03:39.673 --> 03:40.406
They got him back there.

03:40.440 --> 03:41.241
Are doctors with him?

03:41.274 --> 03:42.475
No, it's just the police.

03:42.509 --> 03:43.810
BECK: (screaming continues)

03:50.183 --> 03:51.117
OFFICER: You can't go in there.

03:51.151 --> 03:52.252
Yes, I can.
I'm his lawyer.

03:52.285 --> 03:53.319
I don't care who you are.

03:55.622 --> 03:58.324
BECK: (screaming)

03:58.358 --> 03:59.259
OFFICER: You can make it easier

03:59.292 --> 04:00.767
for yourself.
Hey!

04:00.801 --> 04:01.902
You don't.

04:01.935 --> 04:03.570
This man is now
represented by counsel.

04:03.604 --> 04:05.038
OFFICER: You need to leave.
No, I'm not. No--

04:05.071 --> 04:07.207
OFFICER: Let's go!
Get her out of here!

04:07.240 --> 04:09.843
OFFICER: Get her out now. Move!
Get your hands off of me!

04:09.876 --> 04:11.411
Get your hands off me!

04:14.480 --> 04:16.617
BECK: (screams)

04:16.649 --> 04:18.351
STRINGER: Ow!

04:18.384 --> 04:20.420
Take these off of me!

04:20.452 --> 04:22.556
Shut up!

04:22.589 --> 04:25.859
BECK: (groaning)

04:25.892 --> 04:27.861
Move that chair.
I don't wanna hear her.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.433
Eugene.

04:35.569 --> 04:36.836
we have a situation.

04:38.638 --> 04:41.708
MAN (over PA):
Ambulatory director, call 7790.

04:42.976 --> 04:44.144
WILSON: She's right
through there.

04:44.177 --> 04:45.712
They handcuffed her?
Yes.

04:47.147 --> 04:49.415
WOMAN (over PA):
Dr. Gamble to pediatrics.

04:49.449 --> 04:51.317
Dr. Gamble...

04:53.620 --> 04:54.921
Get the cuffs off now.

04:54.955 --> 04:56.823
She's interfering
with an investigation.

04:56.857 --> 04:58.692
Get those handcuffs off
that woman now

04:58.725 --> 04:59.993
or I will make it
my mission in life

05:00.026 --> 05:02.202
to bring down
your entire department.

05:02.235 --> 05:03.236
Eugene.

05:03.269 --> 05:04.337
What the hell's
going on here?

05:04.370 --> 05:05.672
McGUIRE: What's going on
is your client

05:05.706 --> 05:07.941
shot a police officer
who's now in surgery.

05:07.974 --> 05:09.776
That's a brutality claim.

05:09.810 --> 05:11.612
That's a civil rights
criminal violation.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.015
Take the handcuffs off.

05:16.482 --> 05:18.251
Keep her away from us.

05:18.885 --> 05:19.586
We wanna see our client.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.021
McGUIRE: That's not possible.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.123
Your client's currently
being questioned.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.092
He asked for his lawyer.

05:26.126 --> 05:27.728
Fine. File your motion
to suppress,

05:27.761 --> 05:29.062
but you're not going
in that room.

05:29.095 --> 05:30.363
YOUNG: If he's being denied
medical treatment--

05:30.396 --> 05:31.832
The doctor said his injury
isn't life-threatening.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.600
STRINGER: He's been shot
and those thugs in there

05:33.634 --> 05:36.269
are sticking a flashlight
into an open wound.

05:36.302 --> 05:38.004
McGUIRE: The next lawyer
that goes into that room

05:38.038 --> 05:40.173
will be arrested
for obstruction of justice.

05:40.206 --> 05:41.307
We have a right
to see our client.

05:41.341 --> 05:42.408
No, you don't.

05:42.442 --> 05:44.177
We have a right
to hold him for 48 hours.

05:44.210 --> 05:47.180
We are--
Who's the D. A. on call?

05:47.213 --> 05:49.115
Don't know.

05:49.149 --> 05:50.483
Mike.

05:50.517 --> 05:52.519
Eugene, your guy shot a cop.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.220
I am not helping you out here.

05:57.357 --> 05:58.959
Hey!

05:58.992 --> 06:01.034
Hey! I wanna see
your chief of staff.

06:01.067 --> 06:02.268
I'm the chief of the E. R.

06:02.302 --> 06:03.369
YOUNG: Your hospital
is looking at a lawsuit.

06:03.403 --> 06:05.606
Don't lecture me
on liability, please.

06:05.639 --> 06:07.173
Police have taken over.

06:11.044 --> 06:13.313
MORAN: Jimmy!
What the hell's going on?

06:13.346 --> 06:14.981
Wait.

06:15.015 --> 06:16.550
YOUNG: Look, everybody
over here now.

06:19.119 --> 06:21.387
Jimmy, talk to this, uh...

06:21.421 --> 06:22.188
Moran.

06:22.222 --> 06:22.923
Moran.

06:22.956 --> 06:24.224
Find out what happened.

06:24.257 --> 06:25.425
Tara, borrow a computer.

06:25.458 --> 06:27.561
Draft a habeas petition
down and dirty.

06:27.594 --> 06:28.328
What good will that do?

06:28.361 --> 06:29.462
We haven't got a judge.

06:29.495 --> 06:31.197
Mike!

06:31.231 --> 06:32.398
Who's the duty judge?

06:33.099 --> 06:34.100
Don't know.

06:35.936 --> 06:37.771
Does anybody here know
a judge we can call?

06:37.804 --> 06:39.005
Roberta Kittleson.

06:39.039 --> 06:39.840
You got her home number?

06:39.873 --> 06:41.307
BERLUTI: Yeah.
Call her up.

06:41.341 --> 06:43.243
Ellenor,
go to the FBI office.

06:43.276 --> 06:44.444
Report what's going on here.

06:44.477 --> 06:46.346
Tell them a civil rights
crime is being committed

06:46.379 --> 06:47.648
and is ongoing.

06:47.681 --> 06:48.715
BECK: Help!

06:50.216 --> 06:51.718
OPERATOR (over phone):
We're sorry, you have reached

06:51.752 --> 06:53.620
a number
that has been disconnected

06:53.654 --> 06:55.421
or is no longer in service.

06:55.455 --> 06:57.624
We haven't actually
stayed current.

06:58.158 --> 07:00.934
Anybody else know a judge?

07:00.967 --> 07:02.468
How can none of us
be friendly

07:02.503 --> 07:03.770
with a single judge?

07:03.804 --> 07:05.271
They all know our work.

07:06.472 --> 07:08.141
Look, call Alan.

07:08.174 --> 07:10.243
Maybe he's bribed some judge
along the way.

07:10.276 --> 07:11.778
Jimmy, get his story.

07:11.812 --> 07:12.813
Ellenor, FBI.

07:12.846 --> 07:13.614
Let's go.

07:13.647 --> 07:15.516

07:15.549 --> 07:16.717

MAN: Net pulse, IV push.

07:24.257 --> 07:25.892

Get another P. T.,

07:33.266 --> 07:34.234
What do we know?

07:35.435 --> 07:37.738
I can't tell.

07:37.771 --> 07:39.372
It seems like it's taking
a long time

07:39.405 --> 07:40.340
just to get a bullet.

07:40.373 --> 07:41.975
MAN: Suction.
WOMAN: Suction.

07:42.008 --> 07:43.109

07:53.520 --> 07:56.156
What the charges
are gonna be?

07:56.189 --> 07:56.890
Mike.

07:56.923 --> 07:58.291
(machine beeps)

07:58.324 --> 08:00.133
WOMAN:
Doctor, pressure's dropping.

08:00.166 --> 08:01.835
MAN: He's bleeding out.

08:01.868 --> 08:03.103
More suction.

08:03.136 --> 08:04.137
Get me the sternal saw.

08:04.170 --> 08:05.238
We've got to crack his chest.

08:05.271 --> 08:07.173
(indistinct)

08:07.207 --> 08:08.709
MAN: Put more tension
on that retractor.

08:08.742 --> 08:10.476
I need to get in
and massage the heart.

08:10.511 --> 08:11.745
Let's push another
five milligrams.

08:11.778 --> 08:13.379
WOMAN: Here we go.
Five milligrams pushed.

08:13.413 --> 08:15.949

MAN: Yeah.

08:18.318 --> 08:19.586
MAN: Get a clip.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.487
Continuing massage.

08:21.522 --> 08:22.756
Hold massage.
Let me check the rhythm.

08:22.789 --> 08:23.924
MAN: All right.
Still nothing.

08:23.957 --> 08:25.526
No spontaneous respiration.

08:25.559 --> 08:26.793
Nothing?

08:26.827 --> 08:27.994
WOMAN: No.

08:28.028 --> 08:29.663
MAN: Okay.
No (indistinct)

08:31.297 --> 08:32.633

08:38.404 --> 08:40.373
CARROLL: (sobs)

08:40.405 --> 08:41.707
No.

08:44.545 --> 08:45.646
No.

08:46.913 --> 08:47.681
Annie.

08:47.714 --> 08:49.349
No.
Hey.

09:03.136 --> 09:04.170
MORAN: Todd came out first

09:04.204 --> 09:05.839
'cause he was gonna
get the car.

09:05.872 --> 09:07.007
Came out from--

09:07.040 --> 09:08.074
The bar.

09:08.108 --> 09:10.744
Um, so, as I come out,

09:10.777 --> 09:12.345
I hear shots.

09:12.378 --> 09:13.780
I hear shots real close,

09:13.814 --> 09:15.949
and I see Todd take off to,

09:15.982 --> 09:17.684
you know, run for cover.

09:17.718 --> 09:19.219
How far away were you?

09:19.252 --> 09:20.921
I don't know. Um...

09:20.954 --> 09:23.123
25 yards or something
like that.

09:23.156 --> 09:25.559
So then I see the cops
suddenly chasing him,

09:25.592 --> 09:28.094
and, you know,
I think they see him running.

09:28.128 --> 09:29.162
They must figure
that he's, you know,

09:29.195 --> 09:30.631
the shooter or something.
BERLUTI: Well,

09:30.664 --> 09:32.999
if he's innocent,
why did he run from the police?

09:33.033 --> 09:34.167
MORAN: I don't know.

09:37.470 --> 09:38.539
It's a parole violation

09:38.572 --> 09:40.306
for him to be out past 10:00.

09:40.340 --> 09:43.309
Plus, he may have
had some drugs on him.

09:43.343 --> 09:44.578
So, I--

09:46.112 --> 09:47.981
Jimmy, he didn't shoot anybody.

09:48.014 --> 09:48.815
I'm telling you.

09:48.849 --> 09:49.916
Look, Joe,

09:49.950 --> 09:51.685
I know this guy is your friend,

09:51.718 --> 09:53.486
but as your lawyer,

09:53.520 --> 09:56.523
if you can help yourself
here at all,

09:56.557 --> 09:58.058
a police officer is dead.

09:58.091 --> 09:58.892
MORAN: Well,
Todd didn't shoot him!

09:58.925 --> 10:00.400
BERLUTI: Listen to me.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.135
If they make your buddy,

10:02.168 --> 10:04.204
you could be going up
on conspiracy.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.574
There's a window of opportunity

10:07.608 --> 10:08.341
to help yourself.
MORAN: No, no,

10:08.374 --> 10:09.309
he's innocent, man.

10:09.342 --> 10:11.311
I swear I'm telling
the truth.

10:13.046 --> 10:14.881
We got nothing
to do with this.

10:16.717 --> 10:17.884
WOMAN (over PA):
Hospital receptionist

10:17.918 --> 10:19.152
page surgical pre-op.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.386
What's going on?

10:20.420 --> 10:21.855
YOUNG: We need to get
a court order

10:21.888 --> 10:23.590
to get a client out
of police custody.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.058
Tara is drafting a habeas,

10:25.091 --> 10:26.960
but we don't have a judge.

10:26.993 --> 10:28.294
Would you be able to find one?

10:28.328 --> 10:29.696
At 2:00 in the morning?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.698
BECK: (screams)

10:31.732 --> 10:33.867
Well, it's a little urgent.

10:36.336 --> 10:37.370
WALSH: Eugene.

10:39.740 --> 10:42.576
I'm told you're looking
for the D. A. on call.

10:42.609 --> 10:44.110
You?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.278
Is there a problem?

10:45.311 --> 10:46.947
YOUNG: Yes, there's a problem.

10:46.980 --> 10:49.550
The police are back there
coercing a wounded suspect.

10:49.583 --> 10:51.284
A suspect who has
a Fifth Amendment right

10:51.317 --> 10:52.418
to remain silent.

10:52.452 --> 10:55.088
A suspect who has a Sixth
Amendment right to counsel.

10:55.121 --> 10:57.057
A suspect
who has a civil right

10:57.090 --> 10:58.358
not to be tortured.

10:58.391 --> 10:59.425
All of those rights

10:59.459 --> 11:00.934
are currently being trampled on.

11:02.335 --> 11:04.738
Well, certainly,
any and all evidence obtained

11:04.771 --> 11:06.940
in violation of your client's
constitutional rights

11:06.973 --> 11:08.308
would not be admissible.

11:08.341 --> 11:09.976
I'll be sure not
to introduce it.

11:12.178 --> 11:13.046
Anything else?

11:14.515 --> 11:15.549
I wanna see him.

11:17.450 --> 11:18.484
When we're ready.

11:21.922 --> 11:24.190
As I said...

11:24.224 --> 11:25.425
it's urgent.

11:25.458 --> 11:26.960
I don't understand.

11:26.993 --> 11:28.428
They're only screwing up
their own case.

11:28.461 --> 11:30.096
Why are they doing this?

11:30.130 --> 11:32.733
Maybe they're afraid
they don't have a case.

11:32.766 --> 11:34.434
(screaming continues)

11:34.467 --> 11:36.570
WALSH: Did you see him
fire the gun?

11:36.603 --> 11:37.904
No, I heard the shot

11:37.938 --> 11:39.205
and looked up,

11:39.239 --> 11:40.541
but he was the only one there,

11:40.574 --> 11:42.108
the only one around.

11:43.844 --> 11:45.679
I need you to look
at his face again

11:45.712 --> 11:47.981
and confirm that.

11:48.014 --> 11:50.483
Can you do that for me?

11:50.517 --> 11:52.218
Yes.

11:52.252 --> 11:55.188
(music playing)

12:00.333 --> 12:01.768
(coughs)

12:06.807 --> 12:08.008
That's him.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.142
You're sure?

12:10.911 --> 12:12.345
That's him.

12:20.854 --> 12:22.756
Were you able to get photos?

12:22.789 --> 12:24.057
Photos?

12:24.090 --> 12:26.560
No, the police just yanked her
right out of the room.

12:26.593 --> 12:29.395
We--we're not even being
allowed access.

12:29.429 --> 12:31.064
Okay.

12:31.097 --> 12:32.899
Thank you.

12:32.933 --> 12:34.134
Okay? What "okay"?

12:34.167 --> 12:35.035
Aren't you gonna
go down there?

12:35.068 --> 12:35.836
DENKE: No, ma'am.

12:35.869 --> 12:36.637
The procedure between us

12:36.670 --> 12:37.437
and local law enforcement

12:37.470 --> 12:38.572
is we don't get involved

12:38.605 --> 12:40.040
until either they've
charged your client

12:40.073 --> 12:41.274
or released him.

12:41.307 --> 12:42.876
I don't think you understand.

12:42.909 --> 12:45.411
Local law enforcement
is committing the crime.

12:45.445 --> 12:48.314
The torture is ongoing
as we speak.

12:48.348 --> 12:50.183
Until they've completed
their investigation,

12:50.216 --> 12:52.018
we can't get involved.

12:52.052 --> 12:53.787
You're the FBI.

12:53.820 --> 12:56.122
A man is being tortured.

13:01.835 --> 13:03.469
I can be your friend,
Mr. Beck.

13:06.039 --> 13:08.108
I can make these people stop

13:08.141 --> 13:10.476
and I can get you
proper treatment.

13:10.511 --> 13:12.278
But for me to help you,

13:12.312 --> 13:14.380
you need to help me.

13:14.414 --> 13:16.750
I didn't do it.
WALSH: Todd,

13:16.783 --> 13:19.319
we already know you did it.

13:19.352 --> 13:21.154
What we need
is to find the gun

13:21.187 --> 13:23.389
so it doesn't fall
into the wrong hands.

13:25.692 --> 13:27.127
A little cooperation here

13:27.160 --> 13:29.495
go a very long way.

13:29.530 --> 13:30.564
I promise you.

13:32.666 --> 13:35.502
Where's the gun?

13:35.536 --> 13:37.538
I don't know!

13:38.705 --> 13:40.607
I don't know!

13:44.477 --> 13:45.779
YOUNG: You don't have any
recording devices

13:45.812 --> 13:47.113
in this entire hospital?

13:47.147 --> 13:48.949
Believe it or not,
we don't bug the rooms.

13:50.316 --> 13:53.119
Tara, keep dialing our office.

13:53.153 --> 13:54.454
Get as much of this
as you can

13:54.487 --> 13:55.722
on our answering machine.

13:55.756 --> 13:58.625
Jimmy, I need you to find us

13:58.659 --> 14:00.166
a tape recorder
or something.

14:04.070 --> 14:05.005
What happened?

14:05.038 --> 14:06.406
They won't intervene.

14:06.439 --> 14:08.074
He wrote up a 302,
he filed it,

14:08.108 --> 14:09.142
and thanked me for reporting it.

14:09.175 --> 14:10.611
STRINGER:
This is unbelievable.

14:17.818 --> 14:19.485
Here's the deal.

14:19.520 --> 14:21.588
You give us
a statement from Moran

14:21.622 --> 14:23.790
that he saw Beck
shoot the officer.

14:23.824 --> 14:26.560
We'll then let you see Mr. Beck.

14:26.593 --> 14:29.229
Moran didn't see
Beck shoot anybody

14:29.262 --> 14:32.132
because Beck
didn't shoot anybody.

14:32.165 --> 14:34.735
WALSH: Eugene, I'm trying
to play nice here.

14:34.768 --> 14:37.638
Let me tell you something.
WALSH: No, let me share.

14:37.671 --> 14:40.373
I knew that officer personally.

14:40.406 --> 14:42.075
I know his widow.

14:42.108 --> 14:43.877
I know his two children.

14:45.045 --> 14:46.980
Now, what have you got to say?

14:54.988 --> 14:55.922
Marcia!

15:13.514 --> 15:14.615
Marcia,

15:14.648 --> 15:15.949
I need to speak with you.

15:17.150 --> 15:20.053
(screams)
Shh! Shh! Shh! Shh!

15:20.086 --> 15:21.054
Good heavens.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.222
You've woken up
whoever he is.

15:22.255 --> 15:23.857
What are you doing here?

15:23.890 --> 15:24.858
SHORE: You don't
pick up your phone

15:24.891 --> 15:26.026
or answer your bell.

15:26.059 --> 15:28.529
Luckily, I remembered
where you hide your key.

15:28.562 --> 15:29.796
Alan!

15:29.830 --> 15:31.431
I have an emergency.

15:31.464 --> 15:33.166
POLLACK:
What the hell's going on?

15:33.199 --> 15:34.535
I'm very sorry, sir.

15:36.202 --> 15:37.070
Judge Pollack?

15:38.438 --> 15:39.139
Hello, sir.

15:39.172 --> 15:40.240
I didn't recognize you

15:40.273 --> 15:43.376
without your robe.

15:45.211 --> 15:46.580
Alan Shore.
I appeared before you

15:46.613 --> 15:48.348
in an antitrust matter once.

15:48.381 --> 15:49.616
You were terrific,
by the way.

15:49.650 --> 15:51.885
Alan, what in God's name--

15:51.918 --> 15:53.019
I'm not here for sex

15:53.053 --> 15:53.954
you'll be relieved to know.

15:53.987 --> 15:56.456
I'm sure you're relieved.

15:56.489 --> 15:57.824
We have a client.

15:57.858 --> 15:59.192
The police are currently trying

15:59.225 --> 16:00.466
to beat a confession out of him.

16:00.500 --> 16:02.636
The man is wounded,
in need of medical attention.

16:02.669 --> 16:04.037
It's extremely exigent.

16:04.070 --> 16:05.639
I have a habeas petition.

16:05.672 --> 16:08.575
I just need a signature
from either of you actually.

16:08.609 --> 16:10.811
Are you out of your mind?

16:10.844 --> 16:12.679
Marcia,
he's 20 years old,

16:12.713 --> 16:14.848
bleeding, and the police
won't let the doctor

16:14.881 --> 16:16.116
remove the bullet.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.083
(sighs)

16:17.117 --> 16:19.119
Please.

16:19.152 --> 16:19.953
(sighs)

16:21.187 --> 16:22.889
She said no?
SHORE: As soon as I mentioned

16:22.923 --> 16:24.324
his alleged crime.

16:24.357 --> 16:26.126
I don't know how much more
he'll be able to take,

16:26.159 --> 16:28.294
but they are gonna keep him
in there until he confesses.

16:28.328 --> 16:30.230
He's gonna break.

16:30.263 --> 16:31.798
Does he even know
anybody's out here

16:31.832 --> 16:32.933
trying to help him?

16:32.966 --> 16:34.601
I said I was counsel
before I was hauled out,

16:34.635 --> 16:36.336
but I don't know
if it registered.

16:36.369 --> 16:37.838
Were you able to talk to him?

16:37.871 --> 16:39.540
No.

16:39.573 --> 16:40.440
(door opens)

16:50.116 --> 16:51.885
Mr. Beck is going
into surgery

16:51.918 --> 16:53.119
to have
his shoulder repaired.

16:53.153 --> 16:55.856
You people can speak
to him when he comes out

16:55.889 --> 16:56.823
if you'd like.

16:56.857 --> 16:59.125
What did you do to him?

16:59.159 --> 17:01.735
I'm surprised
at that question, Ellenor.

17:01.768 --> 17:03.904
Where is Joe Moran?

17:03.937 --> 17:05.305
He's right there.

17:11.144 --> 17:13.079
Joe Moran?

17:13.113 --> 17:14.114
MORAN: Yes?

17:14.146 --> 17:15.549
You're under arrest
for the murder

17:15.582 --> 17:16.617
of Officer Peter White.

17:16.650 --> 17:17.917
What the hell's going on?

17:17.951 --> 17:19.319
Mr. Beck gave us a statement

17:19.352 --> 17:22.122
that Mr. Moran here
is the shooter.

17:22.155 --> 17:23.056
What are you talking about?

17:23.089 --> 17:24.257
That's crazy!
Be quiet, Joe.

17:24.290 --> 17:25.491
Jimmy, I didn't shoot anybody!

17:25.526 --> 17:27.993
Do not say a word.

17:28.028 --> 17:29.830
I'll see you in custody.

17:29.863 --> 17:31.732
McGUIRE: You have the right
to remain silent.

17:31.765 --> 17:33.767
Anything you say can
and will be used against you

17:33.800 --> 17:34.968
in a court of law.

17:35.001 --> 17:36.402
You have the right
to an attorney.

17:36.436 --> 17:38.004
If you cannot afford
an attorney,

17:38.038 --> 17:40.040
one will be appointed to you.

17:40.073 --> 17:42.108
Do you understand these rights
as I told them to you?

17:46.046 --> 17:48.048
STRINGER: Can't we just
suppress the statement?

17:48.081 --> 17:49.650
Obviously it was coerced.

17:49.683 --> 17:50.884
The guy was tortured.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.318
But he's not the one
being charged.

17:52.352 --> 17:54.621
We can't assert Beck's
constitutional rights

17:54.655 --> 17:57.157
to suppress evidence
against Moran.

17:57.190 --> 17:59.259
Tara, when will Beck
come out of recovery?

17:59.292 --> 18:00.567
WILSON: Oh, they said 7:00 AM.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.868
YOUNG: Good.
Ellenor, Jamie.

18:01.902 --> 18:03.003
You need to be there.

18:03.036 --> 18:04.871
The police know they got
reliability problems

18:04.905 --> 18:06.306
on the statement,
and they'll probably try

18:06.339 --> 18:08.575
to get another one under
less coercive circumstances.

18:08.609 --> 18:11.512
STRINGER: Look, regardless
of whose constitutional rights

18:11.545 --> 18:14.214
have been violated,
can't a statement be quashed

18:14.247 --> 18:16.249
if it's given involuntarily?

18:16.282 --> 18:17.250
Good question.

18:17.283 --> 18:18.018
Research that.

18:19.520 --> 18:21.254
(yawns)

18:23.456 --> 18:24.625
We keeping you up?

18:24.658 --> 18:27.027
Yes, actually.
It's 4:00 in the morning.

18:27.060 --> 18:29.630
FRUTT: Eugene, we probably
should try to get some sleep.

18:29.663 --> 18:31.898
We have other cases that we need
to be awake for tomorrow.

18:31.932 --> 18:33.900
This is the most
important case, Ellenor.

18:35.435 --> 18:37.738
I mean, we all went
to law school.

18:37.771 --> 18:39.806
The idea that
a government agency--

18:41.608 --> 18:43.777
they just tortured a man
in front of us.

18:43.810 --> 18:46.513
This is our most
important case!

19:00.867 --> 19:01.668
(sighs)

19:06.172 --> 19:08.809
Why are they making us
just sit here like this?

19:08.842 --> 19:10.577
Probably to play
with your head a little,

19:12.412 --> 19:15.281
which seems to be working
from the looks of you.

19:15.315 --> 19:16.216
MORAN: (sighs)

19:17.718 --> 19:19.185
My God, man.
I still can't believe

19:19.219 --> 19:20.153
this is happening.

19:20.186 --> 19:22.122
BERLUTI:
Look, it's a good sign

19:22.155 --> 19:24.290
that they haven't hauled you off
to arraignment yet.

19:24.324 --> 19:26.727
It could mean
they know their case wobbles.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.529
What do they wanna talk about?

19:28.562 --> 19:30.797
I don't know.

19:30.831 --> 19:32.733
But whatever goes down here,

19:32.766 --> 19:34.568
you say nothing.

19:38.271 --> 19:40.206
You hear me, Joe?

19:40.240 --> 19:42.008
I will do all the talking.

19:42.042 --> 19:43.544
You don't open your mouth.

19:43.577 --> 19:44.711
If you need to breathe,

19:44.745 --> 19:45.646
do it through your nose.

19:49.683 --> 19:52.986
(vomiting)

19:53.019 --> 19:53.754
Great.

19:55.021 --> 19:56.422
BECK: That's my signature,

19:56.456 --> 19:59.325
but I don't remember
saying all that.

19:59.359 --> 20:00.767
You don't remember?

20:00.801 --> 20:03.303
BECK: They were sticking stuff
into my wound.

20:03.336 --> 20:05.739
I know that's what
they were asking me to say.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.708
Whether I said it or not,

20:07.741 --> 20:09.009
I don't remember.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.545
I was practically blacking
out the whole time.

20:11.578 --> 20:13.647
FRUTT: Okay, well,
let's get to the heart of it.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.015
Is this statement true?

20:15.048 --> 20:17.483
No, Joe didn't shoot anybody.

20:20.320 --> 20:22.488
What happened last night?

20:22.523 --> 20:25.626
We came out of a bar

20:25.659 --> 20:27.728
and we heard gunfire.

20:27.761 --> 20:29.129
I got a little freaked,

20:29.162 --> 20:31.231
so I started running to my car.

20:31.264 --> 20:34.200
I then saw two cops
coming at me.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.302
I had been drinking

20:36.336 --> 20:38.338
and I was out past 10:00.

20:38.371 --> 20:40.373
I'm on parole, you know?

20:40.406 --> 20:42.375
So I just took off.

20:42.408 --> 20:45.211
I went down a dead end alley.

20:45.245 --> 20:47.447
I couldn't go nowhere else,
so I put my hands up,

20:47.480 --> 20:50.183
you know, to surrender,

20:50.216 --> 20:51.217
and they shot me.

20:53.219 --> 20:55.055
What's gonna happen to Joe?

20:55.088 --> 20:56.590
I don't know,

20:56.623 --> 20:58.525
but obviously he's in
a little bit of trouble.

21:00.534 --> 21:03.036
He didn't do anything, okay?

21:03.069 --> 21:05.438
I'm sorry if I said he did.

21:06.640 --> 21:07.874
I was out of it.

21:07.908 --> 21:08.842
I swear.

21:11.612 --> 21:12.946
Look, we probably need

21:12.979 --> 21:14.648
to get you a new counsel.

21:14.681 --> 21:16.082
Why?

21:16.116 --> 21:17.684
Joe Moran is a firm client

21:17.718 --> 21:19.385
and we can't represent
both of you.

21:19.419 --> 21:20.521
Joe and I are together.

21:20.554 --> 21:21.955
FRUTT: Yeah. Well,
you signed a statement

21:21.988 --> 21:23.223
saying that he was the shooter.

21:23.256 --> 21:26.259
And even if you--
I'll take it back!

21:26.292 --> 21:28.228
Ms. Frutt, you people
were there last night.

21:28.261 --> 21:29.796
You saw what happened to me.

21:29.830 --> 21:31.565
Which could make us witnesses

21:31.598 --> 21:33.066
in any civil claim.

21:33.099 --> 21:35.201
No lawyer who comes in now
is gonna believe me.

21:37.037 --> 21:38.371
I got a record.

21:38.404 --> 21:40.006
A cop is dead.

21:40.040 --> 21:41.508
My friend is charged.

21:42.776 --> 21:44.845
Look, you saw what went down

21:44.878 --> 21:46.680
or, at least, you heard.

21:48.549 --> 21:50.216
You know we didn't do this.

22:04.104 --> 22:05.105
WALSH: (clears throat)

22:05.138 --> 22:06.072
Okay, then.

22:08.141 --> 22:10.410
This is my favorite
kind of meeting,

22:10.443 --> 22:13.346
the one where I
and only I, talk.

22:15.949 --> 22:17.450
Your job here, Mr. Moran,

22:17.483 --> 22:20.220
is to listen closely.

22:20.253 --> 22:22.155
Pretend as if the rest
of your life

22:22.188 --> 22:24.090
might turn on what I say.

22:27.828 --> 22:29.563
You already know
your job, counsel.

22:33.534 --> 22:36.469
A police officer is dead.

22:36.503 --> 22:39.540
Somebody must, of course,
go to prison.

22:39.573 --> 22:41.708
At the moment, it appears
as if that person

22:41.742 --> 22:42.809
will be you.

22:45.646 --> 22:47.514
If, however,

22:47.548 --> 22:48.915
you were to sign a statement

22:48.949 --> 22:51.618
saying Mr. Beck is the shooter,

22:51.652 --> 22:53.720
if you agreed
to provide testimony

22:53.754 --> 22:57.057
against Mr. Beck,
of course, truthful,

22:57.090 --> 22:58.391
then we would give you use

22:58.424 --> 22:59.993
in transactional immunity.

23:00.026 --> 23:01.868
Your counsel can explain that.

23:01.902 --> 23:04.137
In layman's terms,

23:04.170 --> 23:05.305
you go free.

23:07.508 --> 23:09.543
Anything short...

23:09.576 --> 23:11.712
of a statement and testimony,

23:12.779 --> 23:14.981
we prosecute you for murder.

23:20.954 --> 23:21.922
I'm gonna give you some time

23:21.955 --> 23:23.690
to discuss this
with Mr. Berluti.

23:31.798 --> 23:34.601
There will be an arraignment
at 1:00.

23:34.635 --> 23:37.470
It'll either be Mr. Beck's

23:37.504 --> 23:38.438
or yours.

23:40.206 --> 23:42.142
(sighs)

23:47.113 --> 23:49.182
I should've seen it.

23:49.215 --> 23:50.684
Seen what?
What the hell is going on?

23:53.053 --> 23:55.221
Here's a crash course
in criminal procedure.

23:56.590 --> 23:59.059
If they coerce a confession
from Beck,

23:59.092 --> 24:00.701
they can't use it against him.

24:00.734 --> 24:02.836
It's unconstitutional.

24:02.869 --> 24:05.138
So what they were doing
in the room

24:05.171 --> 24:06.472
with their torture

24:06.507 --> 24:08.809
was forcing him
to give a statement

24:08.842 --> 24:10.243
against you,

24:10.276 --> 24:12.613
which they can use against you.

24:14.047 --> 24:16.149
Now, they come back to you

24:16.182 --> 24:18.218
with his statement as leverage

24:18.251 --> 24:21.555
to get you to make a statement
against Beck,

24:21.588 --> 24:24.725
which they can legally use
against Beck.

24:26.092 --> 24:27.694
They're doing an end run

24:27.728 --> 24:30.463
around the constitution.

24:30.496 --> 24:31.665
Is this legal?

24:31.698 --> 24:33.466
Legal? No.

24:33.499 --> 24:35.468
Torture's against the law,

24:35.502 --> 24:38.304
but is Beck's statement
admissible against you?

24:38.338 --> 24:40.006
Yes.

24:40.040 --> 24:43.276
Would your statement
be admissible against Beck?

24:43.309 --> 24:44.611
Probably, yes.

24:46.179 --> 24:49.282
Look, I'm gonna go discuss this
with my partners.

24:49.315 --> 24:51.151
We'll formulate a plan
of attack.

24:51.184 --> 24:54.087
I'll be back in an hour.

24:54.120 --> 24:55.121
Make the deal.

24:56.923 --> 24:57.858
I'm sorry?

24:57.891 --> 24:59.125
If they guarantee
that I go free,

24:59.159 --> 25:00.534
I'll give them
whatever they want.

25:00.567 --> 25:01.868
First of all,

25:01.902 --> 25:03.069
that isn't necessary.

25:03.103 --> 25:05.005
They got no real case
against you.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.940
They have enough to arraign me
in two hours,

25:06.973 --> 25:08.709
possibly enough to put me
on trial.

25:08.742 --> 25:10.677
I mean, that alone screws me!
BERLUTI: And second,

25:10.711 --> 25:11.812
I can't commit fraud.

25:13.780 --> 25:15.916
You didn't see Beck
shoot anybody.

25:15.949 --> 25:18.519
You're his alibi
that he didn't shoot the guy.

25:21.522 --> 25:22.689
I was mistaken.

25:25.458 --> 25:26.760
Now that I think back,

25:26.793 --> 25:28.194
he did kill that cop.

25:31.064 --> 25:33.734
Joe, you can't do this.

25:33.767 --> 25:34.668
Come on.

25:34.701 --> 25:35.501
I've done prison.

25:35.536 --> 25:37.037
I can't go back, I can't.

25:37.070 --> 25:38.939
Beck is the guy
they're really after.

25:38.972 --> 25:40.406
They're just using you.

25:40.440 --> 25:41.942
We don't know that for sure!

25:41.975 --> 25:43.009
Even if that's true,

25:43.043 --> 25:44.377
they're still gonna try
to get me

25:44.410 --> 25:45.746
on conspiracy
or something else!

25:45.779 --> 25:47.614
Listen--
MORAN: No! No. I can't risk it.

25:47.648 --> 25:49.583
They're offering me a chance
to go free here, I'm sorry.

25:49.616 --> 25:51.084
Todd Beck is your friend.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.185
Who tried to flip me!

25:52.218 --> 25:53.486
Because he was tortured!

25:53.520 --> 25:56.022
For God's sake, Joe,
don't do this.

25:56.056 --> 25:58.091
What do I have to--
what do I have to bank on, huh?

25:58.124 --> 26:00.601
A fair trial or justice?

26:00.634 --> 26:02.569
I got a glimpse of justice
in that hospital room.

26:02.603 --> 26:04.337
Five lawyers,
you guys couldn't do anything.

26:06.940 --> 26:08.809
I don't wanna hurt Todd, but...

26:08.842 --> 26:10.210
I got to save myself.

26:12.078 --> 26:15.115
(sighs) Make the deal.

26:15.148 --> 26:16.850
I won't.

26:16.883 --> 26:19.019
I'm telling you as my attorney--
Then I'm withdrawing

26:19.052 --> 26:20.120
as your attorney.

26:22.255 --> 26:24.157
I will not commit fraud,

26:24.190 --> 26:26.760
especially to help convict
an innocent man.

26:29.663 --> 26:30.864
I'm done here.

26:35.602 --> 26:36.537
Jimmy?

26:39.105 --> 26:41.141
I expect our privileged
conversations

26:41.174 --> 26:42.408
to stay privileged.

26:52.352 --> 26:53.620
Wait just a second.

26:53.654 --> 26:54.821
They take a statement

26:54.855 --> 26:57.157
that they get as a result
of torture,

26:57.190 --> 26:58.792
use it to get another statement

26:58.825 --> 27:00.266
that they then use
against the guy

27:00.300 --> 27:01.234
who was tortured?

27:01.267 --> 27:02.969
How is that not
poisonous fruits?

27:03.003 --> 27:04.237
YOUNG: Because it isn't.

27:04.270 --> 27:05.972
No court has said so.

27:06.006 --> 27:07.173
And Moran?

27:07.207 --> 27:08.909
BERLUTI: He's already hired
a new attorney.

27:08.942 --> 27:12.579
They're supposedly cutting
a deal as we speak.

27:12.613 --> 27:14.480
SHORE: Sometimes the only
legitimate thing to do

27:14.515 --> 27:17.250
is fight fire with fire.

27:17.283 --> 27:18.484
Meaning?

27:18.519 --> 27:20.687
Well, I have several
professional lady friends.

27:20.721 --> 27:23.223
I say we catch this guy Walsh
on camera

27:23.256 --> 27:24.758
in the act of getting fellatio,

27:24.791 --> 27:26.860
blackmail him into dropping
the charges.

27:28.194 --> 27:29.429
Trust me, it works.

27:29.462 --> 27:33.099
I've settled at least three
cases this way.

27:33.133 --> 27:34.334
WILSON: They've got him.
MAN (over TV): Information

27:34.367 --> 27:35.702
is still coming in.

27:35.736 --> 27:37.170
Mr. Beck was arrested

27:37.203 --> 27:40.106
in the hospital and was,
in fact, released to police

27:40.140 --> 27:41.542
by hospital officials.

27:41.575 --> 27:42.909
He'll be arraigned shortly

27:42.943 --> 27:44.978
at Suffolk Superior Court.

27:45.011 --> 27:47.480
Beck was apprehended--
Well, gee, that's good to know.

27:47.514 --> 27:48.915
I guess I better get down there.

27:48.949 --> 27:50.250
YOUNG: Hold on.

27:50.283 --> 27:51.718
I'm representing Beck.

27:51.752 --> 27:53.019
MAN (over TV):
Police tell us at that time

27:53.053 --> 27:55.656
Beck resisted arrest,
he himself was shot,

27:55.689 --> 27:57.791
although not seriously wounded.

28:14.480 --> 28:15.516
WALSH: Mrs. White.

28:18.318 --> 28:19.920
I'm Kenneth Walsh,

28:19.953 --> 28:20.854
the district attorney.

28:23.624 --> 28:25.959
We've actually met before.

28:25.992 --> 28:26.993
Yes.

28:29.095 --> 28:31.297
Please accept my sincere
condolences.

28:33.333 --> 28:36.102
Your husband
was an exceptional man,

28:36.136 --> 28:37.904
an outstanding police officer.

28:37.938 --> 28:39.673
Why was he killed?

28:39.706 --> 28:42.375
Nobody is telling me
what happened.

28:42.408 --> 28:45.178
We don't exactly know why yet.

28:47.113 --> 28:48.048
Look,

28:49.282 --> 28:50.851
we've got the guy.

28:50.884 --> 28:52.285
We're about to arraign him,

28:52.318 --> 28:54.120
but you don't need
to be here for this.

28:54.154 --> 28:55.221
Go be with your family.

28:55.255 --> 28:56.857
Let me take care of things
on this end.

28:56.890 --> 28:58.124
I wanna see him.

29:00.026 --> 29:01.935
I wanna see the face
of the man

29:01.968 --> 29:03.504
who killed--
I really...

29:03.537 --> 29:05.839
don't recommend that today.

29:09.610 --> 29:12.713
Look, he's not getting out.

29:12.746 --> 29:15.181
There'll be plenty of time
later at his trial.

29:19.319 --> 29:21.988
Let me handle things,

29:22.022 --> 29:22.956
okay?

29:24.290 --> 29:27.227
(music playing)

29:40.874 --> 29:43.777
WOMAN: Case number 72334,

29:43.810 --> 29:46.580
Commonwealth versus Todd Beck,

29:46.613 --> 29:49.349
charge of murder
in the first degree.

29:49.382 --> 29:51.317
Eugene Young for the defendant,
Your Honor.

29:51.351 --> 29:52.719
Waive reading, follow motion

29:52.753 --> 29:53.920
to dismiss the charges.

29:53.954 --> 29:54.988
And we ask, Your Honor,

29:55.021 --> 29:57.090
given the illegal
and outrageous conduct

29:57.123 --> 29:59.059
of the police
and district attorney,

29:59.092 --> 30:01.802
we ask that this motion
be heard now.

30:01.835 --> 30:03.036
Now?

30:03.069 --> 30:04.738
Isn't that jumping the gun
slightly?

30:04.771 --> 30:05.972
YOUNG: There is no gun,
Your Honor.

30:06.006 --> 30:06.973
There is no case.

30:07.007 --> 30:08.575
These charges are being
fabricated.

30:08.609 --> 30:10.977
They were done so by means--
Did we fabricate

30:11.011 --> 30:13.079
the death of Officer
Peter White?

30:13.113 --> 30:14.447
Did we--
YOUNG: There is no witness.

30:14.480 --> 30:15.549
There is no evidence.

30:15.582 --> 30:17.684
There is no trace metal
or powder residue

30:17.718 --> 30:19.052
to indicate that my client

30:19.085 --> 30:20.754
ever fired
or even touched a gun.

30:20.787 --> 30:22.222
We have a signed statement.

30:22.255 --> 30:23.657
YOUNG: Which is the product
of torture,

30:23.690 --> 30:25.091
the product of--
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

30:28.228 --> 30:31.097
Mr. Young, you seem a little
on the amped side here.

30:38.404 --> 30:41.642
Todd Beck was shot
by the police.

30:41.675 --> 30:43.209
He was then put in a room,

30:43.243 --> 30:45.746
denied counsel,
denied medical treatment

30:45.779 --> 30:48.214
while police officers
stuck a flashlight

30:48.248 --> 30:51.251
and other foreign objects
into the wound.

30:51.284 --> 30:53.253
They did so for three hours

30:53.286 --> 30:54.454
until they coerced him

30:54.487 --> 30:56.723
into giving a statement
against Joe Moran.

30:56.757 --> 30:58.358
They then used the statement

30:58.391 --> 31:00.767
to leverage Mr. Moran
against Todd Beck.

31:00.801 --> 31:02.536
Mr. Moran was, in fact,

31:02.569 --> 31:04.170
arrested for this murder

31:04.204 --> 31:05.572
at 3:00 this morning.

31:05.606 --> 31:07.273
And represented by you,
by the way.

31:07.307 --> 31:09.042
Not anymore.
We now represent Mr. Beck.

31:09.075 --> 31:10.310
There's a conflict of interest.

31:10.343 --> 31:11.712
Which pales in the face
of torture.

31:11.745 --> 31:12.646
TEMPLE: All right.

31:15.115 --> 31:16.316
Mr. Walsh,

31:16.349 --> 31:18.585
did you coerce a statement
from Mr. Beck?

31:18.619 --> 31:19.953
I wasn't in the room,
Your Honor,

31:19.986 --> 31:20.887
when the statement was given.

31:20.921 --> 31:23.524
You heard the screaming.

31:23.557 --> 31:25.959
He'd been shot.

31:25.992 --> 31:27.160
TEMPLE: Mr. Walsh,

31:27.193 --> 31:28.328
if you get cute with me,

31:28.361 --> 31:29.429
you will not like my finding.

31:31.898 --> 31:33.834
What happened?

31:33.867 --> 31:37.170
Let's assume it happened exactly
as Mr. Young says.

31:37.203 --> 31:38.972
So what?

31:39.005 --> 31:41.007
If the police coerced
a statement from Mr. Beck,

31:41.041 --> 31:42.643
it's not being used here.

31:42.676 --> 31:44.377
We're relying
on Mr. Moran's statement.

31:44.410 --> 31:45.512
Which you only got

31:45.546 --> 31:47.047
by threatening him
with prosecution.

31:47.080 --> 31:48.682
Which we do all the time.

31:48.715 --> 31:50.817
Forsaking criminal
charges is a...

31:50.851 --> 31:51.885
negotiating tactic

31:51.918 --> 31:53.353
used by every
law enforcement agency

31:53.386 --> 31:55.321
in the country.
Not every agency

31:55.355 --> 31:57.591
commits acts of torture,
Mr. Walsh.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.992
I don't know for a fact
that torture

31:59.025 --> 32:01.201
was committed,
Your Honor.

32:01.234 --> 32:02.703
But once again,

32:02.736 --> 32:04.370
any statements obtained

32:04.404 --> 32:06.139
through that kind of coercion,

32:06.172 --> 32:08.341
we would never seek
to introduce.

32:08.374 --> 32:09.643
But they are using it.

32:09.676 --> 32:10.977
They used a coerced statement

32:11.011 --> 32:12.979
to ultimately get evidence
against my client.

32:13.013 --> 32:15.115
That's poisonous fruits.
According to who?

32:15.148 --> 32:17.050
There's no case law
supporting that.

32:17.083 --> 32:18.251
TEMPLE: What evidence

32:18.284 --> 32:20.854
does the Commonwealth have
against the defendant?

32:20.887 --> 32:22.288
The surviving police officer

32:22.322 --> 32:24.691
will testify
about being shot at.

32:24.725 --> 32:28.161
She'll testify that she saw
Mr. Beck flee the scene.

32:28.194 --> 32:30.496
He ran from the police.

32:30.531 --> 32:32.165
Mr. Moran will testify

32:32.198 --> 32:34.735
that his friend was the shooter.

32:34.768 --> 32:37.137
Call me crazy,
but that's a case.

32:37.170 --> 32:38.939
Mr. Moran's statement is a lie.

32:38.972 --> 32:41.307
WALSH: That's for a jury
to decide, not you.

32:41.341 --> 32:42.275
Your Honor...

32:45.946 --> 32:48.549
I realize we live
in different times.

32:48.582 --> 32:51.417
The Supreme Court has eroded
the exclusionary rule,

32:51.451 --> 32:53.687
we have laws called
the patriot act.

32:53.720 --> 32:56.122
We detain suspects for months,
even years,

32:56.156 --> 32:57.457
without even giving them
a hearing.

32:57.490 --> 32:59.159
We declare persons
of interest--

32:59.192 --> 33:00.100
You're getting off track.

33:00.133 --> 33:00.934
I'm on the track!

33:06.773 --> 33:08.709
I'm on the track.

33:13.547 --> 33:14.748
With each passing day,

33:14.781 --> 33:17.183
we're becoming more
and more a police state.

33:17.217 --> 33:19.520
We no longer hold dear
civil rights.

33:19.553 --> 33:22.723
We no longer lay claim
to expectations of privacy.

33:22.756 --> 33:23.957
In our new world,

33:23.990 --> 33:25.892
we even embrace
this loss of freedoms,

33:25.926 --> 33:27.594
so long as it makes us
feel safe.

33:29.129 --> 33:32.032
But when police officers
commit acts of torture,

33:32.065 --> 33:34.167
there comes a point
where we as lawyers,

33:34.200 --> 33:36.903
as judges,
as guardians of democracy,

33:36.937 --> 33:38.304
where we have to say,
"enough,"

33:38.338 --> 33:40.473
they locked a wounded man
in a room--

33:49.449 --> 33:50.984
Your Honor?

33:51.952 --> 33:53.053
Enough.

33:58.925 --> 34:01.868
(music playing)

34:26.226 --> 34:28.261
The fact that he even took it
under advisement

34:28.293 --> 34:29.929
is a good sign.

34:29.963 --> 34:32.465
For him to consider kicking it
at the arraignment stage,

34:32.498 --> 34:34.400
obviously,
their case looks weak.

34:34.434 --> 34:36.002
I still like my hooker idea.

34:38.204 --> 34:39.239
STRINGER: Ellenor's right.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.007
Even if we go to trial,

34:41.041 --> 34:43.176
all they have
is Moran's statement,

34:43.208 --> 34:45.110
which we can easily attack.

34:45.145 --> 34:47.413
I still don't even know
why they're bringing this case

34:47.447 --> 34:48.949
and with such a rush.

34:48.982 --> 34:50.817
A cop is dead.

34:50.851 --> 34:53.485
STRINGER: Jimmy, there still
needs to be evidence,

34:53.520 --> 34:55.288
for God sakes.

34:55.321 --> 34:56.723
I mean, this just doesn't make
sense.

35:01.401 --> 35:02.435
(sighs)

35:02.468 --> 35:03.537
The judge is back.

35:03.570 --> 35:06.507
(music playing)

35:08.374 --> 35:09.309
MAN: All rise.

35:15.549 --> 35:16.482
Be seated.

35:24.625 --> 35:26.993
I have a 10-year-old son.

35:27.027 --> 35:28.995
Sometimes, I help him
with his homework,

35:29.029 --> 35:30.296
and with math,

35:30.330 --> 35:33.433
he's required to show the work.

35:33.466 --> 35:37.303
It's too bad we don't require
the same of law enforcement.

35:37.337 --> 35:39.239
The police don't have to show
their methodology,

35:39.272 --> 35:42.308
only the evidence that they
actually introduce,

35:42.342 --> 35:46.312
and if anyone needs proof
of the potential for abuse,

35:46.346 --> 35:47.948
we need only look at this case.

35:49.683 --> 35:50.617
Mr. Walsh,

35:51.818 --> 35:52.753
I'm disgusted.

35:54.420 --> 35:56.757
I wish that you had the guts
to prosecute

35:56.790 --> 35:58.759
the officers involved here.

35:58.792 --> 36:01.201
Clearly, you don't,

36:01.234 --> 36:04.304
perhaps because of your own
culpability.

36:04.337 --> 36:06.439
To think that my son

36:06.472 --> 36:09.009
might grow up in your legacy,

36:09.042 --> 36:10.276
it horrifies me.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.380
But Mr. Young,

36:14.414 --> 36:17.618
the evidence being introduced
here against your client,

36:17.651 --> 36:19.686
however reprehensibly obtained,

36:21.321 --> 36:24.290
is technically admissible.

36:24.324 --> 36:26.927
Mr. Moran was not tortured.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.494
His statement,

36:28.529 --> 36:31.698
though made under the threat
of criminal prosecution,

36:31.732 --> 36:34.334
was voluntary.

36:34.367 --> 36:35.401
It stands.

36:38.939 --> 36:41.241
Your motion for dismissal
is denied.

36:41.274 --> 36:42.909
Trial date is set
for June the 6th.

36:42.943 --> 36:45.912
The defendant is held
without bail.

36:45.946 --> 36:47.380
We're adjourned.

37:23.657 --> 37:25.158
Hard fought, Eugene.

37:26.459 --> 37:27.794
I thought you argued well.

37:31.732 --> 37:32.833
For the record,

37:32.866 --> 37:35.468
I consider your guy guilty.

37:35.501 --> 37:36.570
For the record,

37:36.603 --> 37:38.004
you tortured him.

37:38.038 --> 37:39.906
Look, Eugene,

37:39.940 --> 37:41.975
I don't know exactly
what happened on the street

37:42.008 --> 37:43.910
the other night
and neither do you.

37:49.215 --> 37:50.250
Six months.

37:56.389 --> 37:57.691
Six months?

37:57.724 --> 37:58.925
For a cop killer?

37:58.959 --> 38:00.333
We drop the murder charges.

38:00.366 --> 38:02.268
He pleads guilty
to unlawful discharge

38:02.302 --> 38:04.337
of a firearm
within city limits.

38:09.610 --> 38:11.111
I need a response now.

38:13.780 --> 38:15.516
My response is
you'd never offer this

38:15.549 --> 38:17.417
if you really thought
he was guilty.

38:17.450 --> 38:19.385
You can't find the gun,
you have no evidence,

38:19.419 --> 38:20.787
you know you'll lose.
WALSH: You wanna run

38:20.821 --> 38:22.355
the risk of a trial, Eugene?

38:22.388 --> 38:23.824
Fine.

38:23.857 --> 38:25.792
But I'd certainly get
your client's input

38:25.826 --> 38:27.728
before exposing him
to a life sentence

38:27.761 --> 38:29.696
with no parole.

38:29.730 --> 38:30.964
You got a bad shoot

38:30.997 --> 38:32.432
and then you torture
an innocent kid

38:32.465 --> 38:33.499
to cover your--
WALSH: We maintain

38:33.534 --> 38:35.268
the shoot was justified.

38:38.772 --> 38:41.474
I'm offering an out, Eugene.

38:41.508 --> 38:42.643
For who?

38:44.945 --> 38:46.880
I've offered your client
six months

38:46.913 --> 38:48.715
for a class B misdemeanor.

38:48.749 --> 38:50.584
If you feel the need
to reject that,

38:50.617 --> 38:52.018
then please do,

38:52.052 --> 38:54.187
but again,

38:54.220 --> 38:56.557
you might wanna run it
by the client.

38:56.590 --> 38:59.526
(music playing)

39:20.253 --> 39:22.188
(knocks on door)

39:39.139 --> 39:40.340
Beck took the deal.

39:43.644 --> 39:45.145
He had to, Eugene.

39:45.178 --> 39:47.681
He couldn't risk a murder trial.

39:47.714 --> 39:49.616
And as weak
as their case was...

39:51.217 --> 39:52.318
he had to.

39:54.755 --> 39:55.822
No argument.

39:58.959 --> 39:59.760
You okay?

40:02.368 --> 40:03.236
Fine.

40:06.907 --> 40:08.842
(sighs deeply)

40:11.812 --> 40:15.582
Of everything that happened
in the last 24 hours,

40:15.616 --> 40:17.651
the most frightening to me

40:19.720 --> 40:22.022
is the look of futility
in your eyes.

40:24.490 --> 40:26.359
Eugene,

40:26.392 --> 40:28.394
people like you,

40:28.428 --> 40:30.496
they can't give up.

40:32.833 --> 40:34.901
Most people don't wanna live
in a police state.

40:34.935 --> 40:36.603
Most people still believe

40:36.637 --> 40:38.739
that civil liberties
and human rights

40:38.772 --> 40:41.474
are more important than just
rounding up bad guys.

40:43.243 --> 40:46.813
And with the erosion
of our basic human rights

40:46.847 --> 40:48.314
and everything else
that is going on

40:48.348 --> 40:49.449
in this country,

40:51.552 --> 40:53.419
what most people need right now,

40:53.453 --> 40:55.522
desperately need,

40:57.758 --> 41:00.060
is for men like you

41:00.093 --> 41:03.069
not to give up.

41:03.103 --> 41:06.039
(music playing)

41:41.041 --> 41:43.977
(music playing)

42:07.107 --> 42:08.474
WOMAN: You stinker!

42:09.009 --> 42:11.477
(music playing)
