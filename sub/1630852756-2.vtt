WEBVTT

00:19.228 --> 00:21.855
That's cute.
Oh, wait. Oh, she's here.

00:23.565 --> 00:24.566
Hey, girl.

00:24.650 --> 00:27.110
-You made it, finally.
-I did.

00:27.194 --> 00:28.362
Hey.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.781
-Oh, you look so cute.
-Oh, come meet my sister.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.993
-Hey.
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

00:35.077 --> 00:36.912
So lovely to meet you.

00:38.789 --> 00:39.957
I hope it wasn't--

00:53.720 --> 00:55.430
-There you go.
-Thanks.

02:41.745 --> 02:45.499
Mr. Chopra, you've been arrested
on suspicion of conspiracy to abduct.

02:45.582 --> 02:48.252
This interview will be recorded
with both video and audio.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.380
I have to remind you
that you don't have to say anything,

02:51.463 --> 02:53.799
but it may harm your defense
if you do not mention when questioned

02:53.882 --> 02:55.968
something
which you later rely on in court.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.845
Anything you do say
may be given in evidence.

02:58.345 --> 03:01.056
I know you've already been asked,
but for the sake of the camera,

03:01.139 --> 03:02.808
are you sure
you don't want legal representation?

03:05.561 --> 03:09.147
I don't need it. There's obviously been
some sort of misunderstanding.

03:09.648 --> 03:10.649
Well, we'll see.

03:11.817 --> 03:14.236
I'm gonna be honest with you
in the hope that you'll reciprocate.

03:14.736 --> 03:15.737
No time for games.

03:15.821 --> 03:18.156
We have reason to believe
a young man's life is at risk.

03:18.949 --> 03:20.909
Answer my questions honestly,
and I'll help you.

03:21.410 --> 03:23.871
Lie to me, and I won't be able to.

03:25.122 --> 03:26.540
Where is Leo Newman?

03:28.375 --> 03:31.170
-I have absolutely no idea.
-Is this for real?

03:31.253 --> 03:32.963
Is he here in the UK?

03:33.046 --> 03:34.673
This isn't Shiv winding me up?

03:37.718 --> 03:40.220
Yeah, I mean, no comment.

03:40.304 --> 03:41.471
Leo who?

03:42.055 --> 03:43.473
Do you recognize this?

03:47.352 --> 03:50.272
Leo hasn't been seen or heard of
since being bundled into that suitcase.

03:53.233 --> 03:54.776
What's the significance of the masks?

03:59.072 --> 04:02.367
I don't know.
I've never even heard of Leo Newton.

04:03.827 --> 04:04.912
Newman.

04:05.662 --> 04:07.497
Can't seriously think I kidnapped him.

04:07.581 --> 04:10.042
Abduction is only classified as kidnap
once a ransom demand

04:10.125 --> 04:12.002
or proof of life has been received.

04:12.085 --> 04:13.670
Until we know what the people
in the masks want,

04:13.754 --> 04:16.632
we can't be certain
whether this is terrorist-related,

04:16.714 --> 04:19.134
politically motivated or simple extortion.

04:22.513 --> 04:24.473
-Are you asking me?
-Do you know?

04:24.556 --> 04:27.184
Do you think I'd be stupid enough
to do this without a solicitor

04:27.267 --> 04:28.477
if I was involved?

04:28.560 --> 04:30.562
Well, it could equally be construed
as very smart.

04:34.358 --> 04:35.734
When can I get out of here?

04:36.610 --> 04:39.238
My mum is gonna be in a right state.

04:39.321 --> 04:40.906
Answer the questions, help convince

04:40.989 --> 04:43.242
our American friends you're nothing more
than a finance manager

04:43.325 --> 04:44.326
having a really bad day,

04:45.118 --> 04:47.663
and we'll get you out of here
in a matter of hours, okay?

04:48.455 --> 04:49.540
"Okay"?

04:49.623 --> 04:52.668
Today took two years to plan.

04:53.168 --> 04:56.463
People came from all over the world,
spent money they haven't got.

04:56.547 --> 05:01.385
So, no. Actually, I'm about as far from
"okay" as I could possibly be right now.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.847
Come on.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.098
Ask your questions,

05:06.849 --> 05:10.352
and then I'll consult my fiancé,
who happens to be a lawyer,

05:10.435 --> 05:15.607
about exactly how much it's gonna cost you
to make this anything like "okay."

05:19.403 --> 05:20.612
Do you know this man?

05:23.448 --> 05:25.242
Never seen him before.

05:28.328 --> 05:29.329
No comment.

05:30.789 --> 05:31.790
Who is he?

05:33.250 --> 05:35.210
Do you have any idea
where he might be now?

06:43.529 --> 06:44.530
Seany?

06:44.613 --> 06:45.822
Hello, Granda.

06:51.954 --> 06:52.955
Son.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.629
Give me a full account
from the time you arrived in America.

07:01.171 --> 07:03.882
I got a cab from the airport
and met my sister at the hotel.

07:04.466 --> 07:06.343
-Monique?
-She's at NYU.

07:07.135 --> 07:10.889
I've never been over,
so the plan was to have a night out,

07:10.973 --> 07:13.392
sort of hen party,
and then bring her back.

07:15.519 --> 07:17.437
-Is she here too?
-Keep going, please.

07:18.856 --> 07:22.192
The room wasn't ready yet,
so we went and saw some sights.

07:22.276 --> 07:25.445
Did some shopping,
and then Mon went back to her place.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.989
I went back to the hotel.

07:27.072 --> 07:28.073
What time was this?

07:28.949 --> 07:29.950
5:00-ish?

07:30.993 --> 07:31.994
And then?

07:32.661 --> 07:35.581
I'd arranged to meet Mon at a bar at 7:30,

07:35.664 --> 07:39.293
so I unpacked and chilled for a bit.

07:39.376 --> 07:40.502
And did you leave again

07:40.586 --> 07:42.546
between arriving back
and going to the bar?

07:42.629 --> 07:44.423
I think I went to the spa.

07:45.924 --> 07:47.009
Yeah, I did.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.845
But when I got to the changing room,

07:50.429 --> 07:53.724
Mon texted and said
we should get a cocktail at the hotel

07:53.807 --> 07:55.017
before her friends turned up.

07:56.768 --> 07:59.146
-So you left without using the spa?
-Yes.

08:02.191 --> 08:04.860
And did you meet anyone else
as you moved around the hotel?

08:06.236 --> 08:07.905
I got ready and met Mon.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.115
And you'll have to speak to Monique
and her friends

08:10.199 --> 08:11.617
about where we went after that.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.827
All I know is, there were a lot of bars,

08:14.494 --> 08:16.538
a club, dancing, champagne,

08:16.622 --> 08:20.751
some seriously expensive sliders paid for
by some guys who thought they'd pulled.

08:22.044 --> 08:24.379
Were you away from your party
at any point in the evening?

08:24.880 --> 08:27.758
No. Well, I mean, I went to the loo, but…

08:27.841 --> 08:30.761
-Phone calls?
-I probably texted Joe.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.429
You have my phone. You can check it.

08:33.222 --> 08:34.847
What time did you return to the hotel?

08:34.932 --> 08:36.265
I have no idea.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.308
I drank way too much.

08:38.393 --> 08:41.480
I left Mon and her friends at the club,
and she went straight to the airport.

08:42.356 --> 08:43.357
Estimate.

08:44.149 --> 08:45.609
I can't even remember getting back.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.445
I know I got a cab,
made it back to my room,

08:48.529 --> 08:50.697
but the next thing I remember
is my alarm going off,

08:50.781 --> 08:52.533
saying it was time to go to the airport.

08:53.575 --> 08:55.827
There's no CCTV of you
returning to the hotel.

08:57.329 --> 08:59.498
There was a side door, I think.

08:59.581 --> 09:01.124
A side door not covered by a camera?

09:03.544 --> 09:04.545
So you don't believe me.

09:04.628 --> 09:07.172
New York is a long way to go
for such a short trip.

09:07.881 --> 09:09.424
You must see how odd that looks.

09:09.508 --> 09:12.928
My sister is the only person
I wanted to spend my hen night with.

09:13.011 --> 09:15.055
What's so odd about that?
She's my best friend.

09:35.284 --> 09:37.744
-Hey, Joe.
-Hey. The police are here.

09:38.829 --> 09:41.039
-What's going on?
-Well, I don't know yet.

09:41.123 --> 09:43.125
I'm calling people who might,
but the world's asleep.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.252
My lot are at the hotel.
I'm heading there now.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.004
You can just keep in touch.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.923
Call me if you hear anything, okay?
I'll do the same.

09:50.007 --> 09:51.383
Thanks, Mon.

09:51.466 --> 09:52.551
Okay.

09:57.806 --> 09:59.016
Do you know what she's done?

09:59.516 --> 10:00.642
She hasn't done anything.

10:01.143 --> 10:02.895
Should I tell you what I think she's done?

10:03.437 --> 10:05.939
-No. Excuse me.
-Yeah.

10:40.182 --> 10:41.391
Monique!

10:41.475 --> 10:42.976
I'm coming, Mum! Wait!

10:59.159 --> 11:00.494
I don't have long.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.120
That makes two of us.

11:02.829 --> 11:06.041
What have I told you about leaving candles
burning when you go to sleep, Granda?

11:06.124 --> 11:07.292
It's a fire risk.

11:07.376 --> 11:12.422
The sight's almost completely gone now.
What's the point in spending on lights?

11:12.506 --> 11:14.466
If you can't see,
what's the point of a candle?

11:15.300 --> 11:17.052
I'll give up totally then, will I?

11:17.928 --> 11:18.971
It's freezing.

11:20.222 --> 11:21.557
You need to look after yourself.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.602
Is there no food at all?
These are almost a year out of date.

11:25.686 --> 11:27.771
I won't eat tinned tomatoes.

11:27.855 --> 11:30.274
I said that when you bought all that stuff
the last time.

11:31.692 --> 11:33.026
I'm sorry I haven't been around.

11:36.280 --> 11:39.908
Has anybody been asking about me?
Nobody's been to the house?

11:39.992 --> 11:41.785
Only those nosy parkers you sent.

11:44.913 --> 11:47.165
-They're still bringing you meals?
-If I let them in.

11:49.084 --> 11:52.838
And I don't need me eyes to know that
you're shaking your head. So, stop it.

11:58.594 --> 12:00.804
Okay. Good.

12:03.015 --> 12:06.310
You'd be amazed
what a hungry soldier can do

12:06.935 --> 12:10.189
with a tin of beans
and a bit of imagination.

12:10.272 --> 12:11.398
You're a good boy.

12:11.982 --> 12:12.983
I wish I could stay.

12:14.860 --> 12:18.822
Well, at least this time, I'd be telling
whoever comes looking the truth

12:18.906 --> 12:21.241
when I say that I haven't seen you.

12:25.454 --> 12:28.790
They are coming, Seany, aren't they?

12:44.556 --> 12:45.557
Monique!

12:59.780 --> 13:00.906
What's going on, Mum?

13:00.989 --> 13:02.449
They're throwing us out now.

13:02.533 --> 13:04.368
It's okay. Don't worry.
You're doing a search, yeah?

13:05.118 --> 13:06.954
-And you are?
-Monique Thompson. You?

13:07.037 --> 13:09.915
Searching for what, exactly?
Where's my Natalie?

13:09.998 --> 13:13.627
We're here to execute a search warrant.
I can't tell you anything more than that.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.045
Where are you going?

13:15.128 --> 13:16.672
My uncle's not feeling well.
He's wandered off.

13:16.755 --> 13:17.756
-Who has?
-Don't worry.

13:17.840 --> 13:20.467
-Tell Terry to get everyone to the hotel.
-Don't you think you should get changed?

13:20.551 --> 13:21.718
-I'm fine.
-Put a coat on.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.136
I said I'm fine, Mum.

13:28.225 --> 13:29.226
What are you hiding?

13:30.769 --> 13:31.854
No comment.

13:34.106 --> 13:36.692
What did you do
after you checked into the hotel at 10:16

13:36.775 --> 13:37.943
last Monday morning?

13:38.026 --> 13:40.863
-No comment.
-You asked if there was somewhere

13:40.946 --> 13:43.740
you could work until your room was ready.
What work, Aadesh?

13:44.241 --> 13:45.242
No comment.

13:45.325 --> 13:48.203
Was it for the meeting you had
with representatives of Cooper Newman?

13:50.038 --> 13:52.499
To pitch yourself
as a cybersecurity consultant?

13:55.919 --> 13:57.045
No comment.

13:58.964 --> 14:01.300
Why did you lie to your family
about where you were going?

14:03.010 --> 14:04.052
No comment.

14:05.012 --> 14:07.097
Do you know
who runs Cooper Newman PR, Aadesh?

14:07.181 --> 14:09.766
Obviously. She's just
been named ambassador to the UK.

14:09.850 --> 14:12.352
-Mr. Chopra.
-She's also Leo Newman's mother.

14:15.564 --> 14:17.024
What did you do after the meeting?

14:18.859 --> 14:20.736
What were you doing at 2:00
the following morning?

14:20.819 --> 14:22.905
I'll tell you what I wasn't doing.
A bloody kidnapping!

14:22.988 --> 14:23.989
Mr. Chopra.

15:04.780 --> 15:06.657
You didn't check in
till after three o'clock.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.951
I was running late. Bad habit.

15:09.535 --> 15:11.370
What time were you scheduled to speak?

15:11.453 --> 15:15.082
The conference started at 3:00.
I was due onstage at 4:30.

15:15.165 --> 15:17.709
-Didn't want to hear other presentations?
-Not really.

15:19.378 --> 15:21.213
What was the exact nature
of the conference?

15:21.922 --> 15:23.382
I'm sure you already know that.

15:24.925 --> 15:26.927
The Cooper Newman Foundation

15:27.010 --> 15:29.054
gives money to institutions
all over the world.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.764
Speakers from some of the beneficiaries

15:30.848 --> 15:33.392
talked about projects
the donations made possible.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.810
It's basically corporate PR.

15:34.893 --> 15:38.313
And Katherine Newman was there throughout,
with her son, Leo?

15:38.814 --> 15:41.608
I imagine so.
As I said, I missed the opening.

15:41.692 --> 15:43.026
Why were you there, Tara?

15:43.110 --> 15:45.737
Because their donation helped the college
build a research library.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.406
Sure. But why choose you?

15:49.658 --> 15:50.659
Why not me?

15:52.035 --> 15:53.704
Were you asked or did you volunteer?

15:53.787 --> 15:57.082
All my colleagues had commitments,
whereas my domestic situation is more…

15:58.166 --> 15:59.168
complicated.

15:59.960 --> 16:01.128
So, you volunteered?

16:02.754 --> 16:03.881
Yes.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.593
With the same reluctance
you showed delivering your speech?

16:09.011 --> 16:10.095
I was jet-lagged.

16:10.721 --> 16:11.763
Still am.

16:13.098 --> 16:15.058
Why didn't you attend
the drinks and gala dinner?

16:16.226 --> 16:19.646
Same answer. I had a quick drink
at the bar to help me sleep.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.065
Talk to anyone at the bar?

16:22.608 --> 16:26.111
Passed the time of day with the barman.
Apart from that, not that I recall.

16:26.612 --> 16:27.905
Then I went to bed.

16:28.530 --> 16:29.531
What time?

16:30.532 --> 16:31.783
9:30, 10:00?

16:32.534 --> 16:34.077
Did you leave your room again after that?

16:37.372 --> 16:38.415
Actually, yeah.

16:38.498 --> 16:39.958
I couldn't sleep,

16:40.042 --> 16:43.128
so I thought I'd do what I do at home,
and I got up and walked.

16:44.046 --> 16:45.589
You often have trouble sleeping?

16:45.672 --> 16:46.798
Sometimes.

16:46.882 --> 16:48.675
But walking
seems to help calm my thoughts.

16:48.759 --> 16:50.886
It's when I work things out.

16:50.969 --> 16:52.054
That and then Diazepam?

16:54.097 --> 16:55.390
You've been in my house?

17:44.439 --> 17:45.482
Nicola.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.029
I was hoping you'd be here.

17:51.780 --> 17:52.906
Sean, is that you?

17:53.407 --> 17:54.408
Permission to mount?

17:57.035 --> 17:58.036
Well…

17:59.037 --> 18:01.081
correct term is "board."

18:03.959 --> 18:04.960
"Board."

18:15.637 --> 18:16.638
Wait.

18:18.682 --> 18:19.683
You're alone, right?

18:20.851 --> 18:22.019
Why do you think I'm here?

18:22.519 --> 18:23.520
Come on.

18:28.734 --> 18:30.152
Let's get out on the water.

18:44.416 --> 18:45.834
Am I gonna be here all night?

18:47.628 --> 18:49.505
Meant to be going
to the Maldives tomorrow.

18:51.089 --> 18:52.508
Or today. Look…

18:53.133 --> 18:54.218
What time is it?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.388
What are we waiting for?

18:58.889 --> 19:02.017
In a world
in which it seems harder and harder

19:02.100 --> 19:05.354
to recognize what the objective truth is
about anything,

19:06.772 --> 19:09.566
scientific research,
and the buildings housing it,

19:09.650 --> 19:11.860
become ever more sacred

19:12.486 --> 19:14.488
as certainties become ever more scarce.

19:16.532 --> 19:19.159
On behalf of the university,
I'd like to thank the foundation.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.702
That doesn't look like jet lag.

19:20.786 --> 19:23.997
That looks like someone having to say
thanks for a present they actually hate.

19:24.790 --> 19:25.707
Something funny?

19:27.334 --> 19:28.710
Just thinking about my daughter.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.631
Not funny. No.

19:34.591 --> 19:35.884
Do you know Leo Newman, Tara?

19:37.845 --> 19:38.846
No, I don't.

19:38.929 --> 19:39.930
Never met him?

19:40.013 --> 19:41.014
No.

19:41.974 --> 19:44.184
But you knew he was studying
at the university, didn't you?

19:44.935 --> 19:45.936
Didn't you?

19:47.104 --> 19:48.814
-Yes.
-Because you protested

19:48.897 --> 19:50.357
against his admission.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.776
I'm not sure if "protested"
is the right word.

19:52.860 --> 19:55.821
I questioned whether there was a link
between the money from the foundation

19:55.904 --> 19:57.114
and Leo being awarded a place.

19:57.197 --> 19:59.449
Looks like you kicked up
quite a fuss on campus.

19:59.533 --> 20:00.909
And you leaked it to the media.

20:00.993 --> 20:03.161
These things have to be transparent,
or everyone suffers.

20:04.162 --> 20:05.914
Still, you must have annoyed
a lot of people.

20:06.832 --> 20:08.417
Including your bosses.

20:08.500 --> 20:09.710
It's a place of learning.

20:09.793 --> 20:12.129
People see the importance
of standing up for what you believe in.

20:12.212 --> 20:13.881
Which is what, in your case?

20:15.465 --> 20:16.550
Meritocracy.

20:18.260 --> 20:19.261
So, what happened?

20:20.012 --> 20:22.890
There was a college investigation.
They found no evidence of wrongdoing.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.142
So, Leo was there on merit?

20:25.225 --> 20:26.226
Yes.

20:28.103 --> 20:29.938
-And you definitely don't know him?
-No.

20:32.024 --> 20:34.151
That is strange,
because he seems to know you.

20:36.320 --> 20:38.655
Our colleagues in America
recovered a laptop of Leo's

20:38.739 --> 20:41.867
on which your name appears regularly
in his lecture notes.

20:43.452 --> 20:46.121
I have no control
over who sits in on my lectures.

20:46.205 --> 20:47.706
Okay. Why didn't you tell me

20:47.789 --> 20:49.917
about your connection with Leo
when I first mentioned his name?

20:50.000 --> 20:52.002
There is no "connection."
I raised concerns.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.837
They were investigated. I was wrong.

20:54.630 --> 20:58.967
And you don't think it looks odd that you
should go and pay homage to Cooper Newman?

21:00.093 --> 21:01.220
It's old news.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.555
I have more important things
to worry about.

21:29.039 --> 21:30.415
Blue Robin Holdings.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.711
What?

21:34.795 --> 21:35.838
Recognize the name?

21:36.922 --> 21:38.423
-No.
-We're looking at computers

21:38.507 --> 21:39.716
from your home and your workplace.

21:39.800 --> 21:43.929
You have Blue Robin Holdings bank details
saved on your personal laptop.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.430
It seems they make regular deposits

21:45.514 --> 21:47.850
to an account registered
at a public building in Vauxhall.

21:47.933 --> 21:50.853
Don't know anything
about that. I'll--

21:51.854 --> 21:53.230
I'll have to look into it.

21:53.313 --> 21:54.648
Yeah, so will we.

22:03.574 --> 22:04.575
Hey.

22:04.658 --> 22:06.660
I'm not seeing updates from you, Scott.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.621
There's not a lot to say yet.
The suspects are still being questioned.

22:09.705 --> 22:10.956
Well, obviously not by you.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.625
No.
There are some issues around jurisdiction.

22:13.709 --> 22:14.710
Really?

22:15.627 --> 22:18.881
There's a bigger issue around a kid
that was snatched 48 hours ago,

22:18.964 --> 22:21.341
and we still have no idea
who took him or why,

22:21.425 --> 22:24.344
let alone where he is right now.
I don't have a lot of time here.

22:24.428 --> 22:25.762
Yeah, I understand that.

22:26.430 --> 22:27.264
Do you?

22:28.891 --> 22:29.892
How long do you think

22:29.975 --> 22:32.644
the head of the biggest
communications agency on the planet

22:33.228 --> 22:35.314
is going to agree
to keep her son's abduction quiet?

22:36.148 --> 22:39.610
The Internet just named Leo Newman
as the kid in the suitcase, Scott.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.153
This thing's gonna break.

22:41.236 --> 22:43.197
It could be any minute now,
and when it does,

22:43.280 --> 22:44.990
the fact that we have nothing

22:45.073 --> 22:47.576
stops being our problem
and becomes global news.

22:47.659 --> 22:49.411
Listen, are we working on extradition?

22:49.494 --> 22:50.537
Of course.

22:50.621 --> 22:51.622
Good.

22:51.705 --> 22:53.165
These guys look good to you, right?

22:55.417 --> 22:56.793
It's still kind of hard to tell.

22:59.129 --> 23:03.050
Well, get in that room and do whatever
it takes to make telling easier. Okay?

23:03.133 --> 23:04.593
Okay. Will do.

23:23.779 --> 23:24.780
I've missed this.

23:25.489 --> 23:26.532
Did you now?

23:31.370 --> 23:32.371
Oh, fu--

23:34.164 --> 23:35.165
Wait.

23:36.834 --> 23:37.918
You know what I like.

23:52.057 --> 23:53.058
How's that?

23:58.438 --> 23:59.481
Make sure it's tight.

24:17.457 --> 24:18.458
That's it.

24:28.760 --> 24:29.887
What are you doing?

24:32.723 --> 24:33.724
Sean.

24:40.147 --> 24:41.481
Sean!

24:45.194 --> 24:46.320
Absolutely not.

24:46.403 --> 24:48.822
Well, we're running out of time here,
and so is Leo.

24:51.116 --> 24:52.576
Nice to meet you. Scott Anderson.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.578
Thank you for assisting us,
Agent Anderson.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.623
Your liaison should help communication
all around. Where are we?

24:58.248 --> 25:01.418
Well, Natalie Thompson's financial
arrangements need further scrutiny.

25:01.502 --> 25:04.004
Tara McAllister had a grudge against
Cooper Newman and Aadesh Chopra--

25:04.087 --> 25:07.007
Has elected to go "no comment."
All of which I saw.

25:07.090 --> 25:08.967
What I'm not seeing is evidence.

25:09.051 --> 25:10.719
Do we have enough to hold them?

25:10.802 --> 25:11.803
Not yet, sir.

25:12.346 --> 25:14.598
Excuse me, but four British citizens

25:14.681 --> 25:16.517
living in pretty close proximity
to each other

25:16.600 --> 25:19.728
spent one night at that hotel
before flying out the next day.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.772
At least two of them
have links to Cooper Newman.

25:21.855 --> 25:24.274
Who were holding a conference.
Half the guests had links to Cooper.

25:24.358 --> 25:25.984
-They're lying.
-How do you know that?

25:26.068 --> 25:27.069
Can you prove it?

25:27.152 --> 25:29.947
Given some time, pushing them harder,
I think so.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.698
I don't need advice
on running an interrogation.

25:32.407 --> 25:34.952
Meanwhile, Sean Tilson
is leaving a trail of destruction

25:35.035 --> 25:37.037
on his way to wherever it is he's heading.

25:37.120 --> 25:39.748
He's the link between the gang
in the masks and whoever has Leo.

25:39.831 --> 25:41.458
That's why he stayed in New York.

25:41.542 --> 25:44.378
The only way I'm stopping this
escalating to a linked series crime

25:44.461 --> 25:46.213
and a world of pain for all of us

25:46.296 --> 25:48.799
is my assurance
that we're close to apprehending Tilson.

25:48.882 --> 25:51.218
Let me sit in.
I'll put them under some pressure.

25:51.301 --> 25:53.262
What makes you think
their answers will be any different?

25:55.722 --> 25:56.723
Experience.

25:57.349 --> 26:00.102
Sit in.
But leave the questions to Vanessa.

26:00.602 --> 26:02.354
Work together on this. We need results.

26:05.816 --> 26:06.817
Who's this?

26:06.900 --> 26:10.404
FBI Special Agent
Scott Anderson enters the interview room.

26:10.487 --> 26:12.030
You're still under UK jurisdiction,

26:12.114 --> 26:15.075
and Agent Anderson
will not be asking questions.

26:19.580 --> 26:21.373
Why the Park Madison?

26:22.958 --> 26:25.752
I-- I wanted everything to be special.

26:25.836 --> 26:27.337
You're still renting, aren't you?

26:27.421 --> 26:30.048
Nobody under the age of 40
can afford to buy in London.

26:30.132 --> 26:33.677
But not everybody stays in luxury hotels,
yet also uses loan sharks.

26:35.596 --> 26:39.975
If you know about him, then you must also
know it wasn't me who borrowed that money.

26:40.058 --> 26:42.227
Where'd you get the cash
to pay him, Natalie?

26:42.311 --> 26:43.312
Well, I…

26:43.395 --> 26:46.190
-…put it aside for the trip for ages.
-In cash?

26:47.107 --> 26:50.235
In cash. That's why it was in dollars.

26:50.736 --> 26:53.155
Once you say you're getting married,
you hardly buy a drink,

26:53.238 --> 26:57.284
and Mon said it was best to shop
on my credit cards, so…

26:57.367 --> 26:59.745
Still, it's a lot of money for one day.

27:00.412 --> 27:02.623
Like I said, I wanted it to be special.

27:02.706 --> 27:04.499
Where did you change the money?

27:09.129 --> 27:11.381
-Can't remember.
-You must have a receipt.

27:12.633 --> 27:15.802
I would have thought someone in
your job always kept scrupulous records.

27:15.886 --> 27:18.889
And I would have thought someone
in yours would only arrest criminals.

27:25.270 --> 27:27.648
You couldn't afford to go
to America, could you?

27:27.731 --> 27:31.193
Actually, your bank records suggest you
could barely afford to go to Birmingham.

27:31.735 --> 27:33.445
Where you told your wife you were.

27:34.488 --> 27:36.573
Why such an expensive hotel, Aadesh?

27:37.658 --> 27:38.659
No comment.

27:40.869 --> 27:42.704
What is that? Can he not do that?

27:42.788 --> 27:45.249
-What?
-The… That.

27:45.332 --> 27:46.834
You heard it right?

27:46.917 --> 27:49.211
We've been looking at the CV
you gave to Cooper Newman,

27:49.294 --> 27:51.880
on which you lie
about your academic achievements,

27:51.964 --> 27:54.132
your employment history,
your involvement in charity work

27:54.216 --> 27:55.843
and your living arrangements.

27:55.926 --> 27:58.762
He did it again. Is he allowed to do that?

27:58.846 --> 28:00.597
You're a liar. Aren't you, Aadesh?

28:05.644 --> 28:09.565
This is the man
whose photograph we showed you earlier.

28:10.691 --> 28:13.277
Interpol issued a Red Notice
for his arrest two years ago.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.028
He's a very dangerous individual.

28:15.112 --> 28:18.949
He also checked into the Park Madison
last Monday, under a pseudonym.

28:19.032 --> 28:21.660
Here he is in the lobby at 17:15.

28:23.912 --> 28:27.332
Here he is in the hotel bar at 19:22.

28:28.250 --> 28:31.003
And here's you.

28:33.172 --> 28:35.340
Going into the men's room,
right after him.

28:36.884 --> 28:39.845
-Only you said, "Never seen him before."
-I didn't see him.

28:39.928 --> 28:40.929
-Please, Mr. Chopra--
-No!

28:41.013 --> 28:43.098
Saying nothing
is making me look guilty.

28:43.182 --> 28:44.516
I didn't see him.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.102
-Did you talk to him?
-Talk to him? What, in the gents?

28:47.186 --> 28:49.813
You don't talk in the gents. You keep
your eyes on the ceiling while you wazz.

28:49.897 --> 28:52.357
You look down to shake
and keep your eyes in your lane.

28:52.441 --> 28:53.692
Innit?

28:53.775 --> 28:55.402
You didn't speak at all?

28:55.485 --> 28:57.154
-No.
-As I'm sure you're aware,

28:57.237 --> 29:00.574
there's no CCTV in public bathrooms,
so we only have your word for that.

29:00.657 --> 29:02.951
And at this point, Aadesh,
that seems less than reliable.

29:03.035 --> 29:04.286
I'm not lying.

29:04.369 --> 29:05.871
-Bullshit.
-Agent Anderson.

29:05.954 --> 29:09.249
He spent the whole day scoping the place,
and then they debriefed in the men's room.

29:09.333 --> 29:11.210
What happened to him
not asking any questions?

29:11.293 --> 29:13.295
That was an accusation.

29:16.715 --> 29:18.425
What did Cooper Newman
say about the meeting?

29:18.509 --> 29:21.178
Why? What do you think they told us?

29:21.261 --> 29:23.514
Just wondered how they thought it went.

29:24.681 --> 29:27.392
Don't suppose they're gonna call me now,
are they?

29:34.191 --> 29:38.195
No one does this to me, Sean!
Do you hear me?

29:38.820 --> 29:42.241
I don't care if he finds out about us.

29:42.908 --> 29:46.370
I don't care if he divorces me.
It'll be worth it.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.793
This is bloody kidnap!

29:55.170 --> 29:56.922
What did you do after the meeting?

29:57.881 --> 29:59.758
Nothing.
I got room service. I went to bed.

29:59.842 --> 30:02.052
His first trip
to one of the greatest cities on Earth,

30:02.135 --> 30:03.512
and he doesn't leave the hotel.

30:03.595 --> 30:06.098
I live with five adults in a house
the size of this room.

30:06.181 --> 30:08.809
-Nothing beats sleep.
-What were you doing at 2:00 a.m.?

30:11.228 --> 30:13.105
What? N-Nothing.

30:13.814 --> 30:18.193
Hotel records show you selected
an on-demand movie at 1:43 a.m.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.862
Miami Spice.

30:22.364 --> 30:24.116
You know what I'd do
if I was gonna slip out,

30:24.199 --> 30:27.160
knowing I'd have to convince people
sometime later that I was actually there?

30:27.244 --> 30:29.288
Right before I left, I'd start a movie.

30:29.371 --> 30:31.456
I'd figure there'd be
some record of me watching.

30:31.540 --> 30:34.751
-You wouldn't hire porn though, would you?
-If I looked like you, that's what I'd do.

30:34.835 --> 30:36.253
What is that supposed to mean?

30:36.336 --> 30:38.255
Do you remember the plot of Miami Spice?

30:38.338 --> 30:39.715
Yeah. I think you were in it.

30:39.798 --> 30:41.508
-Oh, you know, it's funny--
-Okay!

30:45.929 --> 30:47.306
I am not a liar.

30:48.515 --> 30:50.267
All right? I am not a liar.

30:50.350 --> 30:54.021
I pretended to be
more successful than I am

30:54.104 --> 30:56.899
because I was meeting the world's
top strategic communications agency,

30:56.982 --> 30:58.442
and I needed them to take me serious.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.027
That's why I stayed at that hotel.

31:00.110 --> 31:03.071
Is that why you also didn't mention
you have a criminal record?

31:08.076 --> 31:09.786
How is that not a question?

31:09.870 --> 31:11.455
I thought you weren't asking questions.

31:11.538 --> 31:14.249
Well, I just keep wondering
about this bag.

31:16.502 --> 31:17.503
What bag?

31:18.003 --> 31:20.464
The one you left in a locker at the spa.

31:21.173 --> 31:23.842
Then picked up at reception when they
reminded you about it at checkout.

31:24.635 --> 31:25.719
What was in it?

31:26.512 --> 31:28.347
Toiletries. Obviously.

31:28.430 --> 31:29.431
Not cash?

31:30.641 --> 31:32.518
-Not what?
-You weren't leaving a bag

31:32.601 --> 31:35.479
full of cash for someone to pick up later?

31:36.188 --> 31:37.189
Are you mad?

31:40.234 --> 31:41.610
You know what I think?

31:42.611 --> 31:44.154
I think you're the money.

31:45.614 --> 31:47.741
Operation like this takes three things.

31:47.824 --> 31:52.913
Planning, tech savvy
and a certain amount of untraceable cash.

31:54.414 --> 31:55.916
You're the money.

31:58.877 --> 32:00.379
And you're full of shit.

32:03.173 --> 32:05.926
I was a kid. It was a caution.

32:06.009 --> 32:08.262
I thought it was spent once I was 18.

32:08.345 --> 32:10.848
You hacked the main examining board
for England and Wales

32:10.931 --> 32:14.142
and gave two upcoming A-level exam papers
to all your mates,

32:14.226 --> 32:15.477
making them completely unusable.

32:15.561 --> 32:18.313
But I came clean then,
and I'm coming clean now.

32:18.397 --> 32:20.357
You came clean because you got caught.

32:20.440 --> 32:24.111
Our problem, Aadesh, is that someone
at the Park Madison last Monday night

32:24.194 --> 32:27.197
had the expertise to disable
and then override CCTV

32:27.281 --> 32:29.199
on the 15th floor for 11 minutes.

32:29.283 --> 32:32.327
They recorded the abduction
and then released it simultaneously

32:32.411 --> 32:35.581
from a batch of seemingly
untraceable proxy email accounts.

32:35.664 --> 32:38.208
Not everybody
has the know-how to make that happen.

32:38.292 --> 32:39.918
-But plenty do.
-Yeah, including you.

32:40.002 --> 32:41.670
Yeah, but I didn't!

32:43.130 --> 32:47.259
I-- I lied 'cause I need a break.

32:49.845 --> 32:51.096
Just…

32:52.014 --> 32:53.307
I wanna be a dad.

32:54.057 --> 32:56.560
I wanna build a business of my own.
Take care of my family.

32:56.643 --> 32:59.104
That is all I care about.

33:01.440 --> 33:03.942
Oh, pack it in.

33:46.860 --> 33:48.946
-We spoke to Steve.
-Is Daisy okay?

33:49.029 --> 33:51.281
-Does she know what's going on?
-He says in your years together,

33:51.365 --> 33:54.409
he never once knew you to get up
and walk during a sleepless night.

33:55.494 --> 33:56.495
He's lying.

33:58.121 --> 34:02.000
We're going through a divorce, and Steve
will do and say anything to damage me.

34:02.084 --> 34:04.795
-But he's already got custody.
-No, he got temporary custody.

34:04.878 --> 34:07.130
Where I'm from, it's unusual
for the father to get the kid.

34:07.214 --> 34:08.382
Maybe where you're from

34:08.465 --> 34:11.009
they have a more enlightened view
of women who want careers.

34:11.092 --> 34:12.261
In Maryland?

34:13.178 --> 34:14.179
Not so much.

34:14.263 --> 34:15.514
Steve has a career too.

34:15.597 --> 34:17.474
-Steve has a job.
-He earns more than you.

34:17.558 --> 34:21.311
Most people earn more than me, but money
was never the source of his insecurity.

34:21.395 --> 34:22.771
That's intellectual.

34:23.605 --> 34:26.315
Lots of men aren't comfortable
with women who know what they think.

34:26.400 --> 34:29.987
In the divorce petition,
Steve cites "long hours,

34:30.070 --> 34:32.614
binge drinking,
text messages from other men,

34:32.697 --> 34:35.909
an accumulation of erratic behavior
which proved deleterious to the marriage

34:35.993 --> 34:38.161
and her responsibilities as a parent."

34:38.996 --> 34:40.455
He wants to hurt me.

34:40.539 --> 34:43.083
And he knows Daisy
is his most effective weapon.

34:50.424 --> 34:53.760
I'd never neglect her.
Everything I do is for her.

35:13.864 --> 35:15.115
Hey, things change, you know?

35:16.074 --> 35:18.493
You and Steve
must have been almost kids yourselves.

35:19.369 --> 35:21.205
You make one mistake.
Suddenly, you're a parent.

35:21.288 --> 35:24.166
Don't you ever refer to my child
as a mistake.

35:32.090 --> 35:34.468
Have you been seeing anyone
since your marriage broke down?

35:34.551 --> 35:36.136
Nobody serious.
I don't see what that's got--

35:36.220 --> 35:38.138
Where do you go to find
"nobody serious"?

35:39.473 --> 35:42.351
-You've got my phone. I use an app.
-Quite regularly.

35:42.434 --> 35:44.394
Would we be having this conversation
if I was a man?

35:44.478 --> 35:46.939
When was the last time you used it?

35:47.022 --> 35:48.774
Did you use it at the Park Madison?

35:49.733 --> 35:51.235
You said you had no time to waste.

35:51.318 --> 35:53.362
-Did you, Tara?
-That a life is at risk.

35:53.445 --> 35:55.280
-Did you use it?
-I might have checked it.

35:58.200 --> 36:00.827
I did. But no, I didn't use it.

36:00.911 --> 36:03.830
You didn't use it for sex? Or you didn't
use it to communicate with another party?

36:05.332 --> 36:06.875
I-- I don't understand.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.503
End-to-end encryption
makes that particular platform

36:09.586 --> 36:13.799
an effective way to disguise communication
that actually has nothing to do with sex.

36:13.882 --> 36:15.050
Doesn't it?

36:18.262 --> 36:19.429
I have no idea.

36:20.138 --> 36:21.598
I'm all about the sex.

37:17.905 --> 37:18.906
You all right, mate?

38:16.672 --> 38:18.131
You're leaving in 30 minutes.

38:20.008 --> 38:22.761
I'm not going anywhere
until you tell me where you're taking me.

38:23.554 --> 38:24.638
What-- For real?

38:27.182 --> 38:29.935
Your phone and anything
taken in the searches will stay with us.

38:30.477 --> 38:31.478
Any questions?

38:39.319 --> 38:40.320
Okay.

39:29.203 --> 39:30.537
You're really gonna do this?

39:31.830 --> 39:33.040
It's my decision.

39:33.582 --> 39:34.666
You're setting 'em free?

39:35.292 --> 39:36.293
No.

39:53.060 --> 39:54.061
Taxi!

39:54.811 --> 39:55.938
They're not free.

39:57.648 --> 40:00.776
If any or all of them are involved,
they'll trip up.

40:00.859 --> 40:03.612
And when they do, we'll be watching.

41:10.304 --> 41:13.056
He's right, you know.
You really do need to stop doing that.

42:04.691 --> 42:07.194
Thank you.
We also have confirmation hearings

42:07.277 --> 42:11.323
on the president's nominations
for several ambassadorial positions.

42:11.406 --> 42:14.076
Before we go through
the list of the nominees,

42:14.159 --> 42:17.829
I should confirm
that we have postponed the hearing

42:17.913 --> 42:22.292
on the UK placement of Katherine Newman
for the time being.

42:22.376 --> 42:24.503
Okay, I'm going to hand over
to the committee member

42:24.586 --> 42:26.296
from California right now.

42:26.380 --> 42:28.423
Thank you, Senator. And good evening.

42:29.091 --> 42:31.969
I'd like to thank… the…

42:36.390 --> 42:38.559
Tell the truth, Katherine,

42:38.642 --> 42:42.521
or your son dies
with the whole world watching.

42:43.146 --> 42:44.648
Tell the truth.
