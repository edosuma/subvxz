WEBVTT

00:07.074 --> 00:09.875
KALEB: We keep this up for a
few more minutes and I think

00:09.877 --> 00:12.344
we'll be starting to see fish.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.681
Let's just hope we don't
get stuck along the way.

00:20.154 --> 00:22.821
This is Alaska.

00:22.823 --> 00:26.458
This place is
filled with resources.

00:27.695 --> 00:30.696
There's everything you
could want to go after.

00:32.232 --> 00:35.367
And sometimes you have to be
willing to travel a little bit.

00:41.842 --> 00:43.308
Boy, this sure is a nice creek.

00:43.310 --> 00:44.443
Isn't it, Gilbert?

00:44.445 --> 00:45.310
GILBERT: Yeah.

00:45.312 --> 00:47.646
KALEB: It's looking promising.

00:48.115 --> 00:50.649
Kind of been a long, bumpy ride.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.187
Gilbert and I have travelled
hundreds of miles today.

00:55.189 --> 00:56.922
We're a long ways from home.

00:56.990 --> 00:59.258
In search of the
elusive silver salmon.

01:01.929 --> 01:05.130
Oh, I just saw a fin.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.598
GILBERT: Go get that fish.

01:06.667 --> 01:09.068
Go get that fish!

01:10.003 --> 01:11.403
Can I go catch it?

01:11.405 --> 01:14.540
KALEB: Um, they're
half-dead in the creek here.

01:14.608 --> 01:16.075
GILBERT: Why?

01:16.143 --> 01:19.545
KALEB: Because when salmon
hit fresh water, they start

01:19.613 --> 01:21.547
rotting from the inside out.

01:22.082 --> 01:26.218
And they keep rotting until
they spawn and then they die.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.687
There's a dead one right there.

01:28.706 --> 01:30.288
GILBERT: Yeah, I saw that.

01:30.291 --> 01:32.424
KALEB: It's no
longer good to eat.

01:32.493 --> 01:34.893
Unless you're a
bear or a seagull.

01:34.962 --> 01:36.095
So let's keep going.

01:36.163 --> 01:38.564
GILBERT: Okay.

01:38.833 --> 01:42.534
KALEB: The salmon that we get
at home, they are disgusting.

01:43.237 --> 01:45.037
We're getting close, Gilbert.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.838
I call them zombie fish.

01:46.841 --> 01:49.308
GILBERT: Hey,
fishy, fishy, fish.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.843
KALEB: I'm hoping they're a
lot better here than by the

01:50.911 --> 01:53.245
time they make it to McCarthy.

01:53.247 --> 01:55.881
GILBERT: Hey,
fishy, fishy, fish.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.985
KALEB: Let it fly.

02:00.053 --> 02:04.623
And when it hits the
water, it's game on.

02:06.660 --> 02:09.995
It's one of my jobs as a
father to make sure that when

02:10.063 --> 02:12.063
my children are adults.

02:12.066 --> 02:14.333
Come to papa little fishy.

02:14.401 --> 02:19.037
They are able to go out into the
world and provide for themselves.

02:20.207 --> 02:22.340
This is a humpy.

02:22.343 --> 02:24.676
I am uninterested in humpies.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.144
All rotten.

02:26.147 --> 02:28.747
But, this is new to me.

02:29.150 --> 02:30.215
GILBERT: Whoa.

02:30.217 --> 02:32.951
KALEB: I have not fished
the ocean from the shore

02:33.020 --> 02:34.820
ever in my life.

02:34.888 --> 02:38.623
So this fish is gonna
live to spawn another day.

02:39.360 --> 02:42.427
In other words, he's
gonna live to die.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.496
Let's try this again.

02:44.498 --> 02:46.732
Maybe there's silver in
this stream somewhere.

02:48.101 --> 02:52.070
I brought Gilbert with me so
that him and I can learn together.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.672
You got one?

02:53.707 --> 02:54.573
GILBERT: Yeah.

02:54.575 --> 02:56.375
KALEB: Your tip's
bouncing around.

02:56.443 --> 02:58.777
Usually a good sign.

02:58.779 --> 03:01.547
GILBERT: You come here, fishy.

03:02.917 --> 03:04.950
I lost my fish.

03:07.321 --> 03:08.920
Caught one?

03:08.923 --> 03:10.188
KALEB: No.

03:10.191 --> 03:12.724
Aw, sh. Nice!

03:12.793 --> 03:15.160
Try tossing it
downstream, not at me.

03:20.467 --> 03:22.267
RJ: All right.

03:22.336 --> 03:23.202
You ready, dad?

03:23.270 --> 03:24.402
ROBERT: Rock and roll.

03:24.405 --> 03:25.270
See the buoy.

03:25.272 --> 03:27.839
RJ: Yep.
Coming in starboard side.

03:28.943 --> 03:31.643
ROBERT: My name's Robert Miller.
I'm from Sitka, Alaska.

03:32.746 --> 03:35.414
From the Koosk'eidí Clan,
Tlingit Tribe.

03:35.883 --> 03:38.984
My family's been here
for probably 10,000 years.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.353
We're good.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.488
My son RJ and I've been
hunting together since he was

03:43.490 --> 03:45.557
seven years old.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.292
RJ: Let's get rolling.

03:47.294 --> 03:51.530
ROBERT: We're gonna head up
to Appleton Cove, look for a deer.

03:52.833 --> 03:54.165
How long was this soak?

03:54.168 --> 03:55.033
It was just three days?

03:55.035 --> 03:56.167
RJ: Three days, yeah.
ROBERT: Damn.

03:56.170 --> 03:58.837
That's gonna be good, I think.
I hope it's good.

03:59.640 --> 04:02.841
First, along the way we're
gonna check the shrimp pots.

04:04.511 --> 04:07.712
Doesn't look spectacular,
but we got some dinner, bud.

04:07.715 --> 04:09.047
RJ: Hey, there's
a few in there.

04:09.049 --> 04:09.981
ROBERT: All right.
RJ: It's nice.

04:09.984 --> 04:11.449
ROBERT: It's a good start.

04:11.452 --> 04:13.785
Okay. Keep on going.

04:14.188 --> 04:16.721
We use boats out of Sitka
because if you have a boat,

04:16.724 --> 04:20.058
you can access hundreds and
hundreds of miles of beach and

04:20.060 --> 04:22.861
coastline and
different mountains and bays.

04:22.929 --> 04:25.130
RJ: Ho, ho, oh, man.

04:25.132 --> 04:27.266
ROBERT: We got a
freaking giant octopus.

04:27.334 --> 04:30.202
And harvest deer and get shrimp.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.003
A healthy little haul.

04:32.006 --> 04:33.271
I'm pretty happy.

04:33.274 --> 04:34.806
RJ: Oh, yeah.
That's gonna be nice.

04:34.875 --> 04:36.875
ROBERT: It's
gonna be delicious.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.677
RJ: I was born
and raised here.

04:38.679 --> 04:42.481
I left when I graduated high
school and within five years

04:42.549 --> 04:46.318
just couldn't help
but come back here.

04:46.887 --> 04:47.952
Nice work.

04:47.955 --> 04:49.955
ROBERT: It's actually a
really good haul, man.

04:50.023 --> 04:51.890
Hit the road, jack.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.291
RJ: You know, there's
something about this place

04:53.294 --> 04:57.362
that just lures you in and you
can't help but wanna come back.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.701
Looking forward to anchoring
up for the night and

05:02.769 --> 05:04.102
get ready for the hike.

05:04.171 --> 05:05.970
ROBERT: You better not kick
my butt up that mountain.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.372
RJ: I'll try to take my time.

05:07.441 --> 05:08.907
ROBERT: Take care
of your old man.

05:08.975 --> 05:11.543
RJ: See when we get there.

05:17.117 --> 05:20.519
JOHNNY: No matter the time
of year, all along this path of life,

05:20.587 --> 05:24.222
I'm gathering new experiences
and new challenges.

05:26.259 --> 05:29.261
And that's a big reason why
I chose to live in Alaska.

05:30.597 --> 05:34.399
Gonna try to head out...

05:34.401 --> 05:37.736
and do a little bit
of octopus fishing.

05:40.341 --> 05:43.141
Octopus are in
abundance out here.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.811
They have a lot of protein.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.679
So I'm gonna make
some octopus pots.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.147
Just a simple bucket.

05:49.149 --> 05:51.483
One hole in the
top, the entrance.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.953
It doesn't have to be that
big 'cause octopus can squeeze

05:55.021 --> 05:56.955
into very small places.

05:59.159 --> 06:01.426
The reason why I have holes
in the bottom of the bucket is

06:01.428 --> 06:04.029
because it'll be a lot
easier to pull this up.

06:04.097 --> 06:06.832
'Cause these things are
gonna be 100, 200 feet deep.

06:06.900 --> 06:11.302
But I don't want the octopus
to escape out of the bottom.

06:11.305 --> 06:14.773
So I'm gonna put down mesh wire.

06:15.843 --> 06:20.178
You cannot legally trap them,
so this is essentially just a lair.

06:20.247 --> 06:22.314
A place for the octopus
to kinda hunker down,

06:22.382 --> 06:25.717
to hide, eat its meals.

06:25.719 --> 06:27.719
You just gotta hope when you
pull it up off the bottom of

06:27.721 --> 06:30.255
the seafloor that
it's still in there.

06:34.528 --> 06:36.327
(laughing).

06:36.330 --> 06:38.330
You gotta be kidding me, Java.

06:38.398 --> 06:41.099
What do you think you're doing?

06:45.472 --> 06:47.539
So the area I'm picking, it's
about six and a half miles

06:47.607 --> 06:52.610
from home and it's full of
rocks, underwater little cliffs.

06:53.347 --> 06:56.014
They like to sneak
up on their food.

06:57.217 --> 07:00.819
And the food that they eat
also likes the same environment.

07:00.821 --> 07:02.220
Now, they like the deep water.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.791
So I got about 250
foot of line here.

07:06.893 --> 07:10.162
Send that sucker down and
hopefully bag a couple.

07:12.833 --> 07:15.700
What the octopus is gonna do
is just come across this and

07:15.702 --> 07:19.037
make a home out of it.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.275
And that's it.

07:26.246 --> 07:29.180
I gotta build a second one.

07:29.183 --> 07:32.117
I think I'm gonna space
it out, but not too far.

07:32.853 --> 07:35.654
I'm just try to space 'em out.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.794
Send that down to the bottom.

07:42.863 --> 07:46.631
Just a little, little hangout,
for the octopus to go in.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.802
Java, you wanna give
it some luck or what?

07:50.804 --> 07:52.604
Huh?

07:52.672 --> 07:54.272
Come here.

07:54.274 --> 07:55.807
Wanna give it luck?

07:55.809 --> 07:57.509
You already chewed it
up enough, didn't you?

07:59.946 --> 08:00.745
You stay.

08:00.747 --> 08:02.147
You don't go get that.

08:02.215 --> 08:02.947
No, no, no.

08:02.950 --> 08:04.216
You stay. You stay.

08:04.284 --> 08:05.917
You can get that later, huh?

08:08.622 --> 08:12.156
SONTA: This time a year you
get moose crossing the river,

08:12.559 --> 08:16.561
you get mink in the slough,
grouse are still in the woods.

08:18.164 --> 08:22.267
As long as you know how to
trap and hunt, there'll be food.

08:32.579 --> 08:35.446
CHEVIE: That was a nice little
young cow moose that just crossed.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.383
Probably standing
just right up here.

08:38.652 --> 08:41.353
Let's see if something
comes out behind it.

08:44.324 --> 08:46.658
Be in big, deep
(bleep) if you shoot a cow.

08:46.726 --> 08:50.362
But sometimes when there's a
cow there'll be a bull close by.

08:52.533 --> 08:54.799
This is a great opportunity
to, uh, get a bunch of meat

08:54.868 --> 08:57.735
for our family.

08:58.204 --> 09:00.739
What I like to do if I can, if I got
a good enough, close enough,

09:00.807 --> 09:03.341
steady enough shot, is I like
to shoot 'em in the neck.

09:03.343 --> 09:06.678
Right behind the head, right
here, is where I like to hit 'em.

09:06.746 --> 09:10.815
And the thing I like about
that is if you miss 'em,

09:10.817 --> 09:12.751
you usually (bleep) miss 'em.

09:12.819 --> 09:14.219
It's a clean miss.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.687
It ain't stumbling around.

09:15.689 --> 09:18.456
If you hit 'em, they go down.

09:21.962 --> 09:24.963
Well, I don't hear anything.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.298
It's okay.
It's just a good habit.

09:27.301 --> 09:30.101
Stop, wait, listen.

09:30.971 --> 09:33.905
We're just gonna keep on
moseying up this slough here.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.509
Secret location
somewhere outside of Shageluk.

09:41.848 --> 09:43.715
This is the first year I've
had to untie my own boat

09:43.783 --> 09:45.583
in a long time.

09:45.586 --> 09:47.719
Usually my first mate,
my partner, my buddy,

09:47.721 --> 09:49.053
Sonta's here with me.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.189
I, she's home with a
little baby right now.

09:51.191 --> 09:54.726
But I miss her
being out here with me.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.328
We have a really good time.

09:56.396 --> 09:59.698
This is where we
really have fun together.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.511
Dark spot.

10:18.351 --> 10:23.021
(imitating moose call).

10:25.091 --> 10:29.461
(imitating moose call).

10:35.301 --> 10:38.570
(imitating moose call).

10:39.840 --> 10:43.541
(imitating moose call).

10:46.446 --> 10:49.781
Once they're spooked, they
usually won't come to a call.

10:49.783 --> 10:51.983
But it's our only option right
now to get him to come back

10:51.985 --> 10:54.319
out of the brush.

10:55.855 --> 10:59.290
You're not gonna chase a
moose on foot and catch him.

11:01.061 --> 11:03.461
You can see where it's
bedded down in here.

11:03.530 --> 11:05.196
(bleep) all over the place.

11:05.198 --> 11:07.999
He's here.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.068
I'm gonna wrap back
around like this.

11:10.136 --> 11:12.070
If he's in that cottonwood.

11:12.072 --> 11:14.873
I'm gonna wait and
see if I see him.

11:25.485 --> 11:28.086
You can see right here, this
is where our big bull moose

11:28.088 --> 11:30.621
was kicking the
(bleep) outta this tree.

11:30.624 --> 11:32.357
He's busted this off.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.692
There's moose
hair stuck in here.

11:34.695 --> 11:36.828
This is green leaves on here.

11:36.896 --> 11:39.364
So I know it's fresh.

11:41.634 --> 11:45.103
This is the tree line
he was heading for.

11:45.171 --> 11:47.806
Came right through here.

11:48.642 --> 11:50.275
There he is.

11:54.715 --> 11:56.915
♪ ♪

12:03.857 --> 12:06.057
CHEVIE: I'm not gonna shoot.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.827
That's a cow.

12:11.331 --> 12:14.999
There must be a bull with it.

12:18.738 --> 12:22.674
(imitating moose call).

12:22.742 --> 12:24.676
Oh, oh, oh!

12:24.744 --> 12:26.944
There's our moose right there.

12:26.947 --> 12:31.449
(imitating moose call).

12:33.353 --> 12:35.353
Not enough time to
get a good shot.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.555
You wanna make sure
that you have a good shot.

12:37.557 --> 12:39.624
Can't just start flinging
lead all over the place

12:39.692 --> 12:42.193
'cause you're excited.

12:45.698 --> 12:46.764
We can't cross this.

12:46.767 --> 12:48.366
That's all wet out there.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.535
Knee-deep (bleep).

12:52.172 --> 12:53.638
We're seeing moose, man.

12:53.706 --> 12:55.373
It's all good.

12:55.375 --> 12:57.308
I just gotta be on it.

12:57.377 --> 12:59.744
Click, clack, boom.

13:02.983 --> 13:03.915
JOHNNY: There's one.

13:03.983 --> 13:05.917
I think that's one right there.

13:05.985 --> 13:08.052
I always love
being out in nature.

13:08.054 --> 13:11.055
I think that my
mind is the most free.

13:11.457 --> 13:14.993
If I'm stuck indoors, I
don't generally do well.

13:15.662 --> 13:18.329
(Java whining).

13:18.331 --> 13:20.264
What's wrong, girl?

13:20.267 --> 13:22.667
You want to get
that buoy, don't you?

13:22.735 --> 13:24.836
Okay, go get it.

13:29.876 --> 13:32.009
That's a big ass buoy, girl.

13:32.012 --> 13:36.581
Good girl, Java.
Good girl!

13:37.818 --> 13:39.951
That's a good girl. Okay.

13:40.954 --> 13:45.256
Good girl. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

13:48.161 --> 13:50.195
Hold on. Hold on.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.432
Whatever it takes to
keep her happy, I guess.

13:54.500 --> 13:56.767
She always wants to be
a part of everything.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.236
Good girl.

13:58.238 --> 14:00.438
All right, Java.

14:01.507 --> 14:04.075
This is 250 foot of line.

14:06.246 --> 14:07.045
There we go.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.414
50 more feet.

14:15.388 --> 14:17.455
There was an octopus in here.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.857
It's full of shells.

14:19.860 --> 14:22.927
No freaking way.

14:22.929 --> 14:26.197
The top is very
sticky and slimy.

14:26.266 --> 14:29.667
You can see the ink too of the
octopus all along the sides,

14:30.136 --> 14:33.071
the black ring.

14:34.474 --> 14:36.341
That's freaking awesome.

14:36.409 --> 14:40.411
It's just, you gotta be able
to come at the right time and

14:40.413 --> 14:42.981
pull this up when
they're in there.

14:44.150 --> 14:46.684
Set these back down.

14:46.686 --> 14:49.120
Let 'em do their thing
a little bit longer.

14:50.823 --> 14:53.424
All right, I'm gonna go
check out this one down here.

14:53.493 --> 14:55.593
Hopefully, I got some good luck.

14:56.296 --> 14:57.428
You wanna go get the buoy?

14:57.430 --> 14:58.696
You ready?

14:58.765 --> 15:02.901
Go get it.
Go get it.

15:10.577 --> 15:11.910
There's nothing
even in this one.

15:11.978 --> 15:14.579
There's no shells, no nothing.

15:14.647 --> 15:19.117
I might move it, a
little shallower.

15:19.185 --> 15:20.718
(Java whining).

15:20.787 --> 15:23.321
Java, hush, would you?

15:23.790 --> 15:28.126
Never seen a dog so upset that
a buoy's floating away from 'em.

15:30.196 --> 15:33.998
BRITTANY: Anywhere you live
you always have to decide,

15:34.000 --> 15:37.068
is your focus your children, or
is your focus the things that

15:37.070 --> 15:39.470
have to get done?

15:39.472 --> 15:41.872
But in our lifestyle, we get
to bring the kids along for

15:41.875 --> 15:44.275
the things that
need to get done.

15:45.011 --> 15:47.745
KALEB: So, so far in this
spot I've caught weeds.

15:47.747 --> 15:50.348
I've caught water in my boots.

15:50.350 --> 15:53.351
And I've flung my hook
around like an absolute moron.

15:53.353 --> 15:56.087
But I haven't caught any fish.

15:56.823 --> 16:01.893
And I see a dead one floating
around right in front of me.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.032
This is not my specialty.

16:08.034 --> 16:11.302
And just like that,
I catch the bottom.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.906
So, yesterday, Gilbert, we
caught a lot of humpies.

16:15.909 --> 16:19.243
But we're not really after
humpies 'cause they're kinda gross.

16:19.846 --> 16:22.580
GILBERT: I see silver jumping.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.850
KALEB: But, hey, we're
at a new spot today.

16:25.918 --> 16:27.985
My hope is...

16:27.988 --> 16:30.989
oh, oh, I got one.

16:31.992 --> 16:33.657
Gilbert, I got a fish.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.260
GILBERT: Man.

16:36.262 --> 16:37.595
KALEB: He's jumping
all over the place.

16:37.663 --> 16:39.664
Oh, and he's coming in.
I gotta get him.

16:39.732 --> 16:42.266
Nice silver.

16:42.668 --> 16:46.070
I was starting to think that...

16:46.072 --> 16:49.140
Oh, no, don't you dare go
back in the water.

16:49.876 --> 16:52.010
The ocean had bested me.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.278
But here we go.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.581
Time to get the pole
back in the water.

17:00.820 --> 17:04.255
Oh, hey, there's, woo-hoo,
woo-hoo, that's a good one!

17:05.558 --> 17:06.758
Gilbert!

17:06.826 --> 17:08.559
GILBERT: What you got?

17:08.628 --> 17:09.494
KALEB: Pull 'em in slow.

17:09.562 --> 17:12.296
We don't wanna lose our fish.

17:14.034 --> 17:17.668
Aw! He got loose!

17:20.640 --> 17:23.841
Well, Gilbert, I think
it's about time to go.

17:23.910 --> 17:25.976
We did manage to pull some
food out of the ocean,

17:25.979 --> 17:27.712
which is exciting.

17:27.780 --> 17:30.981
But the tide's coming in.

17:30.984 --> 17:32.867
GILBERT: What's that mean?

17:32.919 --> 17:34.652
KALEB: It means this is all
gonna be full of water in a

17:34.720 --> 17:36.788
few minutes.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.457
Let's get back to camp
and let's cook up our fish.

17:41.861 --> 17:44.929
For me, life is about adventure.

17:44.931 --> 17:46.798
Life is about getting out.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.066
C'mon, Gil!

17:48.134 --> 17:49.600
The education.

17:49.669 --> 17:52.470
The, uh, thrill of
seeing a new valley.

17:52.472 --> 17:57.241
And learning what is out there.

17:58.611 --> 18:00.344
Whoa!

18:00.346 --> 18:03.581
GILBERT: What? What?

18:04.684 --> 18:06.851
KALEB: Gilbert, get up to me.

♪ ♪

18:24.053 --> 18:25.586
KALEB: Apparently, I'm not
the only one interested in

18:25.655 --> 18:28.656
catching some fish.

18:28.724 --> 18:32.126
I mean, I'm just standing,
I'm 60 feet away and

18:32.128 --> 18:34.762
he just doesn't even care.

Oh, he just saw me.

18:38.334 --> 18:40.468
He's gone.

18:40.536 --> 18:43.638
He's headed off
through the brush.

18:44.941 --> 18:48.542
Behaving like a good bear.

18:49.012 --> 18:52.079
That's a good reason
why I carry this pistol.

18:52.081 --> 18:54.816
This pistol is for
threats like those.

18:54.884 --> 18:58.752
Because a bear is gonna be
territorial over his food source.

18:59.689 --> 19:01.889
This is just something I
have to be aware of, is the

19:01.891 --> 19:06.494
ever-present threat of bigger,
stronger, meaner wildlife than

19:06.562 --> 19:09.397
me when I'm out with
Gilbert in the woods.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.835
All right, Gilbert,
let's keep going.

19:13.903 --> 19:15.503
Bear's gone.

19:15.505 --> 19:17.772
No need to worry now.

19:20.243 --> 19:23.711
RJ: I grew up
always following my dad.

19:24.180 --> 19:27.381
He taught me a lot of what
I know, if not all of what

19:27.450 --> 19:30.050
I know about deer hunting.

19:30.053 --> 19:34.622
And today we are going up the
mountain in a different style.

19:37.193 --> 19:38.960
I am now taking the lead.

19:41.998 --> 19:44.198
You'd think that you'd
take a bunch of weight off by

19:44.267 --> 19:46.534
leaving a whole camp behind,
but this thing seems

19:46.536 --> 19:49.504
heavier and heavier every
time you put it on.

19:50.740 --> 19:52.339
Something pop outta the brush?

19:52.342 --> 19:53.541
ROBERT: Deer.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.543
RJ: What's that?

19:55.611 --> 19:58.346
ROBERT: Look to that
big clump of trees.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.566
Can't really tell what they are.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.618
RJ: It's a fallen tree.

20:03.686 --> 20:06.153
ROBERT: Well, let's follow
this ridgeline up behind us

20:06.222 --> 20:07.688
and see where it
takes us up there.

20:07.757 --> 20:08.789
It looks pretty easy.

20:08.825 --> 20:11.058
RJ: Yeah.
ROBERT: Relatively speaking.

20:15.364 --> 20:16.964
Thanks, bud.

20:16.966 --> 20:19.500
RJ: All right.

20:20.169 --> 20:22.837
Hopefully we see something.

20:22.905 --> 20:26.707
Sun's not out, so deer
should be out in the open.

20:29.178 --> 20:32.280
ROBERT: We got about 700
feet in elevation to go.

20:33.182 --> 20:35.916
RJ: Deer (bleep).

20:36.586 --> 20:38.986
You see all the
cabbage is chewed up.

20:38.988 --> 20:41.989
This is good sign
of a buck around.

20:42.458 --> 20:45.393
I bet you as soon as we get
up there we see a ton of deer.

20:46.195 --> 20:48.529
ROBERT: Nice deer bed here.

20:48.598 --> 20:51.499
So they're
definitely in the area.

20:52.735 --> 20:55.036
I'll find 'em.

20:59.208 --> 21:02.076
JOHNNY: All I have out
here to rely on is myself.

21:03.946 --> 21:08.115
That's all I really want to rely on
because I'm bound to learn a lot more.

21:12.622 --> 21:14.555
C'mon, Java.

21:14.757 --> 21:17.224
And handoff.

21:17.293 --> 21:19.894
Good girl. Shake.

21:22.031 --> 21:24.699
You make it awfully messy, man.

21:32.041 --> 21:34.775
No shells.

21:34.777 --> 21:38.179
No nothing.

21:38.781 --> 21:41.983
Toss it back in.
Hope for the best.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.852
I still got
another one to check.

21:49.659 --> 21:51.992
No octopus.

21:51.995 --> 21:53.060
Oh, well.

21:53.062 --> 21:55.730
Send this one back out.

21:58.200 --> 22:01.402
So while those octopus buckets
are soaking, I'm gonna make

22:01.404 --> 22:04.805
use of my time and jig
around on the bottom.

22:05.475 --> 22:08.208
You know, you never really
know what you're gonna catch.

22:08.211 --> 22:10.678
Uh, but it is a
possibility to catch octopus.

22:10.680 --> 22:15.549
It's common to
catch them as by-catch.

22:16.419 --> 22:19.854
Why not try do a little jigging?

22:24.293 --> 22:28.295
That sun is, uh, with the
different changes of the

22:28.297 --> 22:32.166
weather, I think the sun
and the shade and the clouds,

22:32.234 --> 22:34.168
these fluctuate a lot.

22:34.236 --> 22:36.237
I gotta put some
more air in these.

22:36.305 --> 22:38.272
But not usually this much.

22:39.909 --> 22:43.377
Feeling little, a
little, little doughy.

22:53.989 --> 22:57.124
I think I'm gonna head
to shore real quick.

22:57.193 --> 23:03.064
'Cause this side of the
boat's not really taking air.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.467
And, um, I just want to
make sure I don't have a hole.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.669
'Cause I'm about six miles away.

23:08.738 --> 23:11.071
A little bit more
than six miles.

23:11.340 --> 23:14.208
I shouldn't be out here.

23:16.679 --> 23:19.146
It's, this thing's leaking.

23:25.671 --> 23:28.639
JOHNNY: Man! (bleep)!

23:29.809 --> 23:34.745
You can see the back of my
boat here is just dragging ass.

23:36.081 --> 23:39.717
Everything just wants to tilt
over, I'm getting water in my boat.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.153
All right, come on,
you can go out.

23:43.156 --> 23:45.489
Go on.

23:51.030 --> 23:55.566
It's very unsafe to be
traveling around out here

23:55.634 --> 23:58.369
in this right now.

23:59.038 --> 24:01.739
Let it drain out real quick.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.311
I'm trying to just listen to
see if I can hear air seeping.

24:11.517 --> 24:13.984
I think I found it.

24:15.388 --> 24:18.889
It sounds like the hole is
underneath this black part.

24:19.792 --> 24:21.725
I bet you this is from Java.

24:21.727 --> 24:24.128
You know, she's using her, her
paws and her claws to try to

24:24.196 --> 24:27.798
get into the boat, and we've
done it 100 times, but I think

24:27.867 --> 24:30.934
it was maybe the straw
that broke the camel's back.

24:30.937 --> 24:32.803
It, it was never like that.

24:35.140 --> 24:39.477
Past the middle of the day,
so I gotta see what I got

24:39.545 --> 24:42.145
and see if I can fix this.

24:42.148 --> 24:44.948
You gotta be kidding me.

bull moose rakin' its horns kinda.

25:20.386 --> 25:23.621
The best thing to use for
this is a shoulder blade.

25:24.991 --> 25:28.392
No shoulder blade in my
back pocket right now.

25:28.460 --> 25:30.727
I got stuff in my boat, but
you could always just use a

25:30.730 --> 25:34.331
stick or a paddle,
or any (bleep) thing.

25:37.536 --> 25:40.203
I don't see any moose out
here right now, but that means

25:40.206 --> 25:43.206
absolutely nothing.

25:43.209 --> 25:45.676
There's bull moose
in here for sure.

26:04.563 --> 26:08.966
I covered a lot of country,

26:09.568 --> 26:12.636

up, might have to change the

style of hunting
that you're doin'.

26:15.307 --> 26:17.040
It's the way it is.

I'm gonna go climb up on that
tree fort and see what I could

All right, this uh, tree
house is payin' big dividends.

26:59.752 --> 27:02.486
The kids love it and I got
to see a moose from there.

27:02.488 --> 27:05.789
I'm gonna jump in my mote
and see if I can get on it.

27:10.029 --> 27:14.431
It takes a long time to figure
out the land, but once you

27:14.500 --> 27:17.167
know the country
it doesn't change.

27:17.236 --> 27:20.537
That's the cool thing, is once you
get that map imprinted in your head,

27:23.308 --> 27:25.876
you really
could start playing the game.

27:28.447 --> 27:32.316
I think we're in the right area.

27:32.384 --> 27:35.385
I think I was lookin' at
these trees right here.

27:35.388 --> 27:38.088
He was straight out from there.

27:40.259 --> 27:43.260
Oh there he is, right there.
He's lookin' right at us.

27:44.530 --> 27:47.331
He's way the (bleep) over there.

27:47.399 --> 27:50.934
He's probably about
650 yards right now.

27:53.338 --> 27:56.206
He's laying down right now.

27:56.208 --> 27:58.542
You can't shoot an animal when
they're laying down, you won't

27:58.610 --> 28:01.612
hit him in the vitals, you gotta
wait for him to stand up.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.292
There's our moose.

28:15.961 --> 28:18.295
There's two bulls.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.297
There's one in the brush and
there's one walkin' away with

28:20.299 --> 28:23.434
one, so I've gotta be very
careful of what the (bleep)

28:23.502 --> 28:25.736
Going on here.

28:27.172 --> 28:29.973
It's not the best shot.

28:33.713 --> 28:36.046
I think they're winded on us,

28:36.048 --> 28:37.981
I don't think
they're gonna come.

28:37.983 --> 28:41.185
They're both behind that tree.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.954
I came in a little bit too hot.

28:46.926 --> 28:51.795
ROBERT: In my Tlingit culture,
10,000 years of lineage,

28:51.864 --> 28:55.833
if you don't hunt and gather,
you're gonna die,

28:57.069 --> 28:59.703
so we gotta prepare for
that best you can.

29:02.808 --> 29:04.074
While we're getting higher,

29:04.076 --> 29:06.343
I think we're start see
some real nice buck rub.

29:06.345 --> 29:08.879
So, we know there's
some nice bucks up here.

29:09.548 --> 29:11.749
We got about three hours left
to hunt once we get up here so

29:11.817 --> 29:15.352
we can get to the beach in time,
so we're crossin' our fingers

29:15.354 --> 29:17.755
and we're gonna see
what can happen.

29:20.092 --> 29:21.291
RJ's up ahead of me.

29:21.360 --> 29:24.027
He's young and half billy
goat, and I'm old and just

29:24.029 --> 29:26.029
a little bit billy goat.

29:26.098 --> 29:29.499
RJ: You can tell that the deer's
been using these little ways,

29:29.502 --> 29:31.635
little walkways for a long time.

29:31.637 --> 29:33.904
It's just, just looks
like a gravel trail,

29:33.972 --> 29:36.907
something you'd see in a park.

29:37.710 --> 29:40.778
It's almost like the forest service
came up here and dug it out.

29:41.246 --> 29:43.881
Probably out feeding
all night last night.

29:44.583 --> 29:47.084
Pretty clear and calm.

29:55.060 --> 29:58.061
We got a little doe over here.

30:02.267 --> 30:06.703
Hopefully the next one is a
buck, get some dinner on the table.

30:12.945 --> 30:16.413
ROBERT: 427 yards.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.216
Staring right at me.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.418
It's just layin' down
in its bed over there.

30:21.420 --> 30:25.489
It's a doe, not legal
till the September 15th.

30:29.428 --> 30:32.663
RJ's up on the ridge.

30:45.978 --> 30:48.979
RJ: I saw a
little tail flicker.

30:50.382 --> 30:52.416

deer on top of the hill.

31:36.578 --> 31:39.046
Felt like a good shot.

the brush that's staring at us.

There's two bucks there, so
if I can get a better view.

You let either of them stop

And it's living

33:33.362 --> 33:35.495
All right, that might
be enough right there.

33:35.531 --> 33:36.763
So, that's the spruce pitch.

you can't just sit,
you gotta try.

33:50.579 --> 33:52.512
Come on, Java.

33:52.581 --> 33:56.450
I don't have my repair kit so
I just kinda have to improvise.

Here goes nothin'.

33:59.855 --> 34:01.455
This'll be my patch.

34:01.523 --> 34:04.991
I got these bibs, kind of a
similar material as the dinghy.

34:05.060 --> 34:08.128
So, I think I'm just
gonna have to sacrifice,

34:08.130 --> 34:12.265
melt this pitch, and get
on with fixing this boat.

34:13.201 --> 34:15.836
All right.

34:20.675 --> 34:23.343
I can't win today.

34:23.345 --> 34:26.613
I think I got my lighter wet
when I was doing the whole

34:26.615 --> 34:29.949
dance with the
boat and the motor.

34:29.952 --> 34:32.719
Nothin'.
There's no spark.

34:36.825 --> 34:40.093
I have a hole on my boat, a
tide that's gonna comin' in,

34:40.162 --> 34:43.830
a lighter that doesn't work,

34:43.899 --> 34:46.967
but I got fuel.

34:47.035 --> 34:49.035
That's one part of the equation.

34:50.105 --> 34:51.972
The only thing missin' is
spark, but I know there's a

34:52.040 --> 34:54.841
spark in this engine
every time I pull start it.

34:54.910 --> 34:57.310
Guarantee I get a fire going.

34:58.246 --> 34:59.712
I know it can happen.

34:59.715 --> 35:02.315
I know it can work, because I
remember when I was like eight years old

35:02.317 --> 35:05.051
I had a mini bike and I was
messing around with

35:05.053 --> 35:07.053
the spark plug and there
was a gas leak and

35:07.122 --> 35:09.322
the mini bike caught on fire.

35:09.324 --> 35:14.794
All right.

35:14.797 --> 35:16.796
Ow, (bleep).

35:16.799 --> 35:18.532
Shocked me.

35:18.600 --> 35:21.835
See if this'll work.

35:34.283 --> 35:37.016
There it is.

35:37.019 --> 35:38.218
Yeah!

35:38.286 --> 35:40.620
That's what I'm talking about.

35:42.624 --> 35:45.625
Yes! Fire!

35:45.694 --> 35:48.094
Aw, yeah!

35:48.096 --> 35:50.263
Look at that.

35:55.036 --> 35:58.838
Oh, and you can see it boilin'.

35:58.841 --> 36:01.241

36:01.243 --> 36:03.176

36:08.383 --> 36:10.183
That's funny 'cause the boat's
not even fixed, you know.

36:10.185 --> 36:14.754
But it's like a, a relief to
continue trying to fix the boat.

36:15.724 --> 36:18.725
It's hardening really,
really, really fast.

36:18.793 --> 36:21.461
God.

36:21.530 --> 36:24.130
I think it's gonna
work pretty good.

That's it right there,
that's what I'm after.

36:27.002 --> 36:30.670
I just need to let that dry
and come back, fill it up with

36:30.739 --> 36:33.440
air, and see if it holds up.

been starvation times, and

36:40.949 --> 36:44.884

38:03.431 --> 38:06.833
We stood right here, and it
would come out of the brush,

38:06.835 --> 38:10.370
and it'd look at us
then go back in,

38:10.372 --> 38:13.473

then go back in.

38:14.843 --> 38:17.844

I thought I'd missed him.

41:50.041 --> 41:52.575
I couldn't believe it,
got really nervous.

41:53.645 --> 41:55.177
ROBERT: Did you get
a buck fever, bud?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.179
RJ: Oh, yeah.

41:56.247 --> 41:59.181
I had to sit there
for like a minute.

41:59.184 --> 42:00.783
ROBERT: Nice.

42:00.785 --> 42:02.719
That's a nice big heart.

42:02.787 --> 42:04.921
Heart of gold.

42:04.989 --> 42:07.457
All we gotta do is get it
five miles to the boat.

42:07.525 --> 42:10.293
RJ: Aren't you glad you're
not packing the deer out?

42:12.730 --> 42:15.798
CHEVIE: We measure our riches
in a totally different way.

42:15.867 --> 42:19.435
You got this kind of meat,
freezer's full, boy it's hard to beat.

42:21.339 --> 42:24.974
I might keep a little bit of
this hide, Sonta sews with it.

42:26.678 --> 42:30.479
It's a, another resource
that we use from this animal.

42:31.215 --> 42:34.150
I know I reap the benefits of
her sewing, I got a nice hats

42:34.218 --> 42:38.721
and gloves and stuff like
that keeps me warm all winter.

42:40.158 --> 42:42.358
It's a nice fat moose.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.226
Some people want to spit out
all the fat, they don't' like

42:44.229 --> 42:48.031
the fat but they never
lived off of it probably.

42:50.969 --> 42:52.835
KALEB: Is this one ready?

42:52.837 --> 42:54.503
Oh, yeah.

42:54.506 --> 42:55.638
Want some?

42:55.707 --> 42:58.308
GILBERT: Yep.

42:58.376 --> 43:02.378
KALEB: This is an amazing
place, and I hope one day we

43:02.380 --> 43:06.049
can return and try to
catch the silver salmon again.

43:07.252 --> 43:10.052
RJ: There's so few places on
the planet that you can really

43:10.055 --> 43:12.121
just get out and do this.

43:12.190 --> 43:13.656
There you go.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.324
Check this out.

43:15.327 --> 43:16.859
ROBERT: Holy cow,
you found the bullet?

43:16.861 --> 43:18.995
RJ: Yeah.

43:18.997 --> 43:21.597
ROBERT: It's emotional to
think about how we can be here

43:21.600 --> 43:23.866
in a land of plenty.

43:23.868 --> 43:27.069
JOHNNY: It's a long trip man,
going through this crap.

43:27.072 --> 43:30.406
ROBERT: Couldn't really ask
for much more than that in life.

43:31.409 --> 43:33.342
CHEVIE: It's the
reason why we live here.

43:33.345 --> 43:35.411
For the quality of life.

43:35.413 --> 43:38.147
JOHNNY: That was a pounding
out there, but Java and I made

43:38.216 --> 43:41.350
it back and that's all that
really matters at this point.

43:42.287 --> 43:43.953
CHEVIE: We're not out here
trying to find ourselves to

43:44.022 --> 43:45.821
figure out who we
are going to be.

43:45.824 --> 43:47.089
RJ: Piece of cake.

43:47.092 --> 43:52.094
CHEVIE: Questioning society or
questioning what the world is.

43:52.097 --> 43:54.130
Whoo.

43:56.234 --> 43:57.833
JOHNNY: Java.

43:57.836 --> 44:00.970
CHEVIE: How you treat the
land is how it treats you.

44:01.039 --> 44:02.905
We start not too big.

44:02.974 --> 44:04.574
SONTA: Not too small.
EMRY: Not too small.

44:04.642 --> 44:06.109
CHEVIE: Hmm?
Just right.

44:06.177 --> 44:08.978
EMRY: It's just right.

44:09.648 --> 44:12.982
CHEVIE: I look at myself as an
equal with animals and

44:12.984 --> 44:17.587
it's a blessing
to be able to know

44:17.655 --> 44:18.921
I'm where I need to be,

44:18.990 --> 44:21.657
where I'm meant to be,
and I enjoy it.
