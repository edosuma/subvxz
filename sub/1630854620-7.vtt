07:33.306 --> 07:34.743
- Meow.

07:34.776 --> 07:36.680
- Well, thank you,
diggity dogs,

07:36.713 --> 07:39.018
for coming to this
pooch park pow wow.

07:39.118 --> 07:42.457
Now, I like to get my fun on
as much as the next dog,

07:42.491 --> 07:44.629
but we all have
to ask ourselves

07:44.696 --> 07:46.332
when should the fun be done?

07:46.399 --> 07:47.669
- Uh, never.

07:47.702 --> 07:49.706
- That's where you're wrong.
But don't worry.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.144
I've come up with a few
cool rules that will--

07:52.177 --> 07:52.979
- We're out of here.

07:53.079 --> 07:55.250
- Hey, get your ass
back on the grass!

07:55.317 --> 07:57.387
- Well, that wasn't
very groovy.

07:57.421 --> 07:58.456
- That's right, Cuddles.

07:58.524 --> 08:00.327
You drove groovy stepmom away,

08:00.393 --> 08:02.230
so say hello
to single working mom.

08:02.297 --> 08:03.667
- And she has had it
up to here.

08:03.734 --> 08:05.203
- That's right she has.

08:05.270 --> 08:06.640
This situation is unacceptable.

08:06.707 --> 08:09.078
[grunts]
- [laughs]

08:09.078 --> 08:10.413
My bad. Oh, hey, Honey.

08:10.480 --> 08:11.717
- Damn it, Chief.

08:11.750 --> 08:13.954
I'm trying to discipline here.
- Ooh. Got to go.

08:13.987 --> 08:17.394
Jill is really fetching
my brains out today.

08:17.461 --> 08:19.031
[laughs]

08:19.131 --> 08:22.572
- As I was saying, the rules
are here to keep us safe.

08:22.605 --> 08:25.243
So repeat after me.
- Number one.

08:25.310 --> 08:27.047
- No recreational barking.

08:27.080 --> 08:28.717
- She can't hear you.

08:28.784 --> 08:31.355
all: No recreational barking.

08:31.389 --> 08:33.527
- Number two.
- No digging holes.

08:33.594 --> 08:35.030
That's how snakes get in.

08:35.063 --> 08:38.403
A hole near the fence
makes us defenseless.

08:38.469 --> 08:40.641
- Laugh at her witty wordplay.

08:40.741 --> 08:42.244
- [fake laugh]
- So?

08:42.244 --> 08:44.481
all: No digging holes.

08:44.549 --> 08:46.787
- How long is she going
to make us do this?

08:46.820 --> 08:48.657
- Somebody's got to have
the jujubes

08:48.690 --> 08:50.126
to stand up to her.

08:50.895 --> 08:53.132
[rhythmic clanking]
- Oh.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.036
- Boy-yo-yoing.

08:55.070 --> 08:58.042
[clanking]

09:00.514 --> 09:02.150
[dog barks]

09:02.217 --> 09:05.123
[squirrel chitters]

09:05.190 --> 09:07.962
[clanking]

09:09.231 --> 09:10.701
- What's up, guys?

09:10.768 --> 09:13.540
Notice any two things
different about me?

09:13.607 --> 09:15.210
[melodic clanking]

09:15.276 --> 09:16.278
- Two bits.

09:16.479 --> 09:19.384
- Diablo, I see you've had a
productive visit to the vet.

09:19.451 --> 09:20.988
- [laughs] You could say that.

09:21.055 --> 09:23.627
You could also say
he pimped my junk.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.998
Ba-bam.
[laughter]

09:26.031 --> 09:26.967
- OK. OK.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.504
We were just going
over the rules.

09:28.604 --> 09:30.373
- Well, that doesn't
sound very fun.

09:30.440 --> 09:32.144
- You said it, Big D.

09:32.210 --> 09:33.279
- All right. All right.

09:33.346 --> 09:36.018
Elsa, what number are we on?

09:36.085 --> 09:37.421
Elsa?

09:37.454 --> 09:38.690
Elsa?

09:38.724 --> 09:41.162
- The only number I
can think of is two.

09:41.228 --> 09:42.865
- OK. Well, we're on three.

09:42.932 --> 09:45.704
Big dogs stay out
of the little dog area.

09:45.771 --> 09:47.909
- Actually, you were
going over the rules,

09:47.942 --> 09:49.579
but I'd kind
of like to know

09:49.646 --> 09:51.315
what Diablo thinks
we should do.

09:51.382 --> 09:52.417
- You do?
- Uh-huh.

09:52.451 --> 09:53.520
- Mhm.
- Yeah.

09:53.554 --> 09:54.722
- Oh yeah.
- I hear that.

09:54.789 --> 09:56.793
- Well, my opinion
is we ditch this bitch

09:56.827 --> 09:58.463
and get out there and play.

09:58.530 --> 09:59.766
- You heard the dog.

09:59.866 --> 10:01.368
Get out there and play.
[clanking]

10:01.402 --> 10:02.538
- Woo-hoo!
- All right.

10:02.605 --> 10:03.907
- Elsa, what the hell?

10:03.974 --> 10:06.078
- I--I don't know
what happened.

10:06.112 --> 10:09.519
It's like Diablo's balls
completely took over my balls.

10:09.552 --> 10:11.923
I mean balls--balls!

10:11.957 --> 10:13.961
- Well, Honey,
nobody said being a dog

10:14.027 --> 10:16.733
pretending to be a working mom
was going to be easy.

10:16.766 --> 10:18.469
How's this pressure for you?

10:18.504 --> 10:20.473
- Just keep doing
what you're doing.

10:20.508 --> 10:22.244
Oh, yes.

10:25.784 --> 10:28.657
- A night in disgusting
lady's house most definitely

10:28.690 --> 10:30.460
will have scared
Kit Kat straight.

10:30.493 --> 10:31.730
[inhales]

10:31.796 --> 10:33.567
I love the smell of vengeance
in the morning.

10:33.600 --> 10:35.036
- Oh, that's mostly urine.

10:35.069 --> 10:39.746
- Oh, Kit Kat, time for you
to beg me to take you home.

10:39.846 --> 10:41.215
- [gasps]
- Oh, God.

10:41.282 --> 10:42.585
[can hisses]

10:42.652 --> 10:45.323
- Ah, ha-ha!

10:45.390 --> 10:47.829
Time to fly.

10:50.233 --> 10:51.035
[gulps]

10:51.101 --> 10:53.339
- Oh, my God.
She's slamming strips.

10:53.406 --> 10:55.476
- [burps]
[fly buzzing]

10:55.544 --> 10:56.880
- Oh, she's crazy.

10:56.913 --> 10:58.784
- Kit Stain.
- OK.

10:58.817 --> 11:01.455
You are coming home with me
right now.

11:01.523 --> 11:03.059
- Is this old cat
bothering you?

11:03.125 --> 11:05.230
- She just thinks
I still live with her,

11:05.296 --> 11:07.234
but this is my home now.

11:07.267 --> 11:08.402
OK.

11:08.469 --> 11:10.139
Now, catch me!

11:10.173 --> 11:12.612
All: [chanting]
Kit Stain! Kit Stain!

11:12.678 --> 11:15.283
Kit Stain!
- Whee!

11:16.720 --> 11:19.491
- I cannot believe
she turned tables on me.

11:19.526 --> 11:20.761
- Just leave her there.

11:20.794 --> 11:23.634
Turn that catio
into a grow room.

11:23.667 --> 11:26.071
- And let her win?
I don't think so.

11:26.138 --> 11:30.748
- Big D in the house,
and I'm not sorry I'm late.

11:30.814 --> 11:33.386
We just wanted
to make an entrance.

11:33.452 --> 11:34.622
- We?
- Yep.

11:34.689 --> 11:36.425
Me and--[grunts]

11:36.492 --> 11:38.462
My jawbreakers.

11:38.564 --> 11:39.732
all: Ooh.
- Wow.

11:39.799 --> 11:41.268
- Those nuts are nuts.

11:41.302 --> 11:42.437
- Are they waterproof?

11:42.505 --> 11:43.907
Should we find out?
- Whoa.

11:43.974 --> 11:45.978
Look who finally grew a pair.

11:46.045 --> 11:47.715
- Bought a pair.
They're fake.

11:47.782 --> 11:49.484
- Yeah. And there's no reason
that testicles

11:49.484 --> 11:53.426
artificial or not should confer
power or affect our behavior.

11:53.492 --> 11:54.796
And now I'm presenting.

11:54.862 --> 11:57.167
- Guess who's cuckoo
for my scratch and sniffs?

11:57.234 --> 11:58.971
- Hey, Chi Chi,
give me the love seat

11:59.004 --> 12:01.710
'cause I need some room
to dog spread.

12:01.776 --> 12:02.812
- Absolutely.

12:02.878 --> 12:04.314
- Then give him the damn seat!

12:04.381 --> 12:05.918
- [yowls]

12:07.788 --> 12:09.091
- It's like they're
following me.

12:09.124 --> 12:10.728
- Yeah, they are, sweet cakes.
[clicks tongue]

12:10.794 --> 12:12.497
- Diablo,
before you interrupted,

12:12.565 --> 12:14.502
we were discussing
how insecurities

12:14.569 --> 12:16.038
can lead to terrible life
decisions.

12:16.071 --> 12:17.808
Something you're obviously
familiar with.

12:17.842 --> 12:19.679
- Insecure? Ha!

12:19.712 --> 12:21.148
Thunder and Joseph
beg to differ.

12:21.215 --> 12:23.854
That's right.
I named my doppelbangers.

12:23.921 --> 12:26.726
But I'm open to suggestions.

12:26.793 --> 12:28.964
- Julie and Julia.
- The Kids in the Hall.

12:28.997 --> 12:31.636
- Your two-ton tortellini.
- The Floperty Brothers.

12:31.703 --> 12:33.573
- Indiana Jones
and the Temple of Boom.

12:33.607 --> 12:34.609
- Back to Kit Kat.

12:34.642 --> 12:36.813
Maybe you need to appeal
to her reasonable side.

12:36.846 --> 12:38.817
- Ha! I have no idea

12:38.850 --> 12:40.253
what the hell
you guys are talking about,

12:40.286 --> 12:42.725
but Tabitha,
if you're having a problem,

12:42.792 --> 12:44.696
look downstairs
because my besticles

12:44.729 --> 12:46.666
would be happy to help.

12:46.733 --> 12:47.902
- OK, Diablo.

12:47.935 --> 12:49.706
That's not entirely
constructive.

12:49.772 --> 12:51.041
- Well, it's better
than the nonsense

12:51.108 --> 12:53.045
you've been spouting lately,
so someone has

12:53.079 --> 12:55.751
to pick up the sack.
- Ba-bam!

12:55.818 --> 12:57.487
- The lesson here
is never skip group.

12:57.555 --> 12:58.690
- All right.

12:58.757 --> 13:00.628
We've all enjoyed
the verbal fireworks,

13:00.661 --> 13:02.698
but now, let's give Honey
the respect

13:02.765 --> 13:05.537
we've arbitrarily decided
she deserves.

13:05.604 --> 13:07.140
- That was yesterday, old man.

13:07.173 --> 13:09.779
- So how'd you get
the name Thunder?

13:09.812 --> 13:11.716
- Back off, ho.
Thunder's mine.

13:11.750 --> 13:12.785
- You can have Joseph.

13:12.852 --> 13:14.989
- No one wants Joseph.
- See?

13:15.023 --> 13:16.960
You already have
so much in common.

13:17.027 --> 13:18.730
- Oh, you want to go?
- She's not worth it.

13:18.764 --> 13:19.932
- You want to go?
- She's not worth it.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.003
- All right, Diablo,
I think you should go.

13:22.070 --> 13:24.842
- Well, guess what.
I don't need therapy anymore,

13:24.909 --> 13:27.581
so I'm just going to take
my everlasting knobknockers

13:27.615 --> 13:28.750
and go home!

13:28.850 --> 13:30.420
- That weasel
with the implants

13:30.486 --> 13:31.790
just gave me an idea.

13:31.856 --> 13:34.494
Kit Kat is going down.

13:35.163 --> 13:38.704
- OK, funky felines,
it's cat-surfing time.

13:38.770 --> 13:40.273
Catch me!

13:40.340 --> 13:41.509
[thud]

13:41.543 --> 13:43.479
Where the hell did everyone go?

13:43.513 --> 13:44.782
- Come on!

13:44.816 --> 13:47.955
There's a bigger, better party
down the street.

13:50.761 --> 13:52.698
- This guy is awesome.

13:52.765 --> 13:54.434
How did you hear about him?

13:54.468 --> 13:55.537
- Flyer at the vape shop.

13:55.604 --> 13:56.773
- Oh, no.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.543
You're vaping again?

14:00.313 --> 14:03.352
- Let's crank this up
to "Sanitize."

14:05.289 --> 14:06.893
Yeah!

14:07.828 --> 14:10.500
- Punch clock,
this bitch has come to work.

14:10.534 --> 14:11.970
Ha. Oh yeah.

14:12.037 --> 14:14.675
all: (chanting) Tabs! Tabs!
Tabs! Tabs!

14:14.776 --> 14:16.613
- Work it out.

14:16.679 --> 14:18.550
- Now, who's life of party?

14:18.617 --> 14:21.021
- Yeah. Woo-hoo!

14:21.088 --> 14:22.725
You played right into my paws.

14:22.758 --> 14:23.960
- What?

14:23.994 --> 14:26.566
- I wanted a party
on the catio all along,

14:26.599 --> 14:28.302
and you just gave it to me.

14:28.369 --> 14:30.406
You got got, gato.

14:30.507 --> 14:31.743
- Liar. [yowls]

14:31.810 --> 14:33.847
- Cat fight!
- Claw her face!

14:49.912 --> 14:51.583
And Waffles,
you were a little pitchy.

14:51.616 --> 14:52.585
Work on that.

No, no, no, no, no,

Oh, my fetch ball.

Damn holes.

15:00.032 --> 15:01.703
- Hey, kid,
you know what's more fun

15:01.770 --> 15:03.139
than chasing a ball all day?

riding me like a horse?

15:05.944 --> 15:07.915
[explosion booms]

15:07.982 --> 15:10.988
- No, canine testicular
implants are real,

15:11.054 --> 15:12.858
not just something
the writers made up.

15:12.925 --> 15:14.762
- Well, I hope you're
enjoying it now, Diablo,

15:14.796 --> 15:16.766
because all
of this lawlessness

15:16.833 --> 15:18.369
is eventually going
to lead to trouble.

15:18.436 --> 15:20.841
- A little word
of advice, Honey bun,

15:20.874 --> 15:22.343
you should learn to lighten up.

Thanks for asking.

16:05.931 --> 16:07.233
Next question.

16:07.300 --> 16:09.471
- Hey, Big D, a rattlesnake
was spotted in the park.

16:09.539 --> 16:11.843
- All the dogs are terrified.
What are you going to do?

16:11.943 --> 16:13.914
- Well, what do you think
I'm going to do?

16:13.947 --> 16:15.717
I am going to handle it.

16:15.784 --> 16:17.655
Chief, shall we?

16:17.721 --> 16:18.857
- And away we go.

16:18.924 --> 16:21.094
- Chiefy Chief, where are you?

16:21.128 --> 16:23.600
I got us a new fetch ball.

16:23.667 --> 16:24.802
- All right!
[panting]

16:24.836 --> 16:26.004
- Ahh!
[clank]

16:26.038 --> 16:28.944
I'm all good.
My bonbons broke my fall.

16:28.977 --> 16:31.583
And now, it's time
to let Thunder and Joseph

16:31.649 --> 16:32.852
do the talking.

16:32.918 --> 16:34.421
What? Oh, no.

16:34.522 --> 16:35.657
Ahh!

16:35.724 --> 16:37.293
[screaming]

16:37.327 --> 16:39.130
[thwack]

16:40.901 --> 16:42.538
- No. Chief, no!

16:42.571 --> 16:44.341
My poor babies. Why?

16:44.407 --> 16:45.878
Why?

16:45.944 --> 16:47.982
- [whines]

16:48.082 --> 16:50.988
- Oh, hey, Diablo.
[laughs]

16:51.021 --> 16:53.693
How did you get here?
[laughs]

16:53.760 --> 16:54.996
Where's my ball?

16:55.062 --> 16:57.467
- [groans]

17:00.006 --> 17:01.943
[cats yowling]
- Fight! Fight! Fight!

17:02.010 --> 17:04.047
- Ooh. Ow.

17:04.114 --> 17:07.020
- So is this like
a weekly thing or what?

17:07.086 --> 17:10.026
- You're going down, Menopaws.

17:10.026 --> 17:11.261
- You got that right.

17:11.328 --> 17:13.032
You're the one who's
going to start bleeding.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.835
That's right.
I'm claiming my age.

17:14.902 --> 17:16.706
I am 15 and fabulous.

17:16.739 --> 17:18.810
[yowls]

17:18.843 --> 17:20.112
[glass shatters]
[gasps]

17:20.146 --> 17:22.718
You broke my
"Cat Fancy" Magazine

17:22.751 --> 17:24.922
Sexiest Cat Alive trophy.

17:24.989 --> 17:29.164
- (crying)
I--I didn't mean to.

17:29.197 --> 17:31.970
- Why must you be this way?

17:32.036 --> 17:34.809
After I've been such
an amazing role model.

17:34.875 --> 17:35.944
- I'm sorry.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.148
I guess just--[inhales]

17:38.182 --> 17:41.723
I just want some attention.

17:41.756 --> 17:43.058
- Attention?

17:43.125 --> 17:46.098
All you do is get attention.

17:46.131 --> 17:48.904
- But not from you.

17:48.970 --> 17:51.008
- Why do you care?

17:51.008 --> 17:52.912
You hate me!

17:52.945 --> 17:55.984
Or--or you don't.

17:56.018 --> 17:57.287
You worship me.

17:57.387 --> 18:00.092
I mean now that I say it
out loud, it makes sense.

18:00.159 --> 18:03.332
- And I wouldn't be so mad
at you if I hated you.

18:03.365 --> 18:07.373
So obviously,
I little bit don't hate you.

18:07.440 --> 18:10.914
- Worship's a little strong,
but...

18:10.948 --> 18:13.653
that means a lot, Tabitha.

18:16.191 --> 18:17.193
You're fat!

18:17.226 --> 18:18.630
- Oh, really, well, you're--

18:18.663 --> 18:19.966
- Tabs, let it go.

18:19.999 --> 18:21.335
- Ugh. Fine.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.607
- I'm proud of you
for being the bigger cat.

18:23.640 --> 18:26.044
- The much bigger cat.

18:26.078 --> 18:28.115
- Tabitha.
- OK, fine.

18:28.182 --> 18:29.819
But I am coffee-mugging
her tonight.

18:29.852 --> 18:30.821
- That's my girl.

18:30.887 --> 18:32.891
[dogs barking]

18:32.958 --> 18:34.227
- Ugh. Look at those animals.

18:34.294 --> 18:35.631
There's a snake
loose at the park,

18:35.664 --> 18:38.002
and all they can think
about is their spicy frozen

18:38.068 --> 18:39.939
meaty sprinkle-covered--

18:39.972 --> 18:41.876
I really want some.
- Hey, Honey.

18:41.909 --> 18:43.112
- Diablo, you're
back from the vet.

18:43.178 --> 18:44.782
You look humbled.

18:44.849 --> 18:47.554
- Well, Chief punctured
Joseph and swallowed Thunder.

18:47.588 --> 18:49.090
And my dad couldn't
write off another pair

18:49.190 --> 18:50.192
as a business expense.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.665
I--I miss them so much.

18:52.698 --> 18:53.700
- Yeah.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.238
They were two of a kind.

18:56.271 --> 18:58.242
- Oh. That means a lot to me.
Thank you.

18:58.275 --> 19:00.112
And I'm sorry
for how I acted, Honey.

19:00.179 --> 19:01.983
It's just the dog pile
happened.

19:02.050 --> 19:03.352
And then even made fun of me.

19:03.385 --> 19:05.791
My man marbles made
me feel powerful

19:05.857 --> 19:07.093
for the first time in my life.

19:07.126 --> 19:09.264
- But Diablo, your bravery
and confidence

19:09.331 --> 19:11.101
didn't come from your Fauxnads.

19:11.134 --> 19:12.136
They came from you.

19:12.170 --> 19:15.142
Your real testicles
aren't between your legs.

19:15.209 --> 19:17.815
Your real testicles
are in your heart.

19:17.881 --> 19:19.117
[inspiring music]]

19:19.184 --> 19:20.954
- Rattlesnake! Help!

19:20.987 --> 19:22.925
Rattlesnake!

19:22.991 --> 19:24.060
- I know what to do.

19:24.127 --> 19:25.597
I'm on my way, Elsa.

19:25.664 --> 19:29.037
It is time to take care of
that snake once and for all!

19:29.104 --> 19:30.741
- Atta boy.

19:30.741 --> 19:32.143
Wait. What? Diablo, no.

19:32.176 --> 19:33.680
You're puny and weak.

19:33.713 --> 19:35.717
[rattling]

19:35.784 --> 19:36.953
[snake hisses]

19:36.986 --> 19:38.723
- Leave my friend alone!

19:38.790 --> 19:40.059
- Oh yeah?

19:40.126 --> 19:41.729
And what are you going to do?

19:41.796 --> 19:42.931
- [hisses]

19:42.998 --> 19:44.367
- Oh my god, a weasel!

19:44.401 --> 19:47.975
- That's right,
and pop pop goes the me.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.244
- [whimpers]

19:49.277 --> 19:51.214
- And stay out!

19:51.281 --> 19:53.820
And that, my friends,
is what I call

19:53.887 --> 19:55.322
the empty sack attack.

19:55.389 --> 19:57.260
[cheering]
- That's right, Big D.

19:57.293 --> 20:00.032
- Diablo, look what you
just did, making me right.

20:00.099 --> 20:01.134
- It's funny, isn't it?

20:01.168 --> 20:02.470
I lost my nads.

20:02.504 --> 20:04.340
And then I was put
to the testes.

20:04.407 --> 20:05.877
Now, come on, everyone.

20:05.944 --> 20:07.380
Let's fill these holes!

20:07.447 --> 20:09.184
- Shut up, Diablo.
- OK.

20:09.284 --> 20:11.455
- Oh.
- Honey, what's the plan?

20:11.488 --> 20:13.793
- Well, I think we probably
should fill these holes.

20:13.860 --> 20:15.262
- Did she stutter?

20:15.329 --> 20:17.701
Fill the damn holes!

20:17.768 --> 20:20.206
[upbeat music]

20:20.272 --> 20:22.043
- Whoa. Wait a minute.

20:22.076 --> 20:23.345
This is disgusting.

20:23.345 --> 20:26.919
- Did I just pay $12
for frozen meat?

20:26.953 --> 20:29.424
- They're on to us! Drive!

20:30.727 --> 20:32.731
- Finally, now,
they'll fix everything.

20:32.765 --> 20:35.035
- And you don't have
to be groovy stepmom anymore.

20:35.102 --> 20:37.240
- Nope. Now, I can be fun aunt.

20:37.306 --> 20:38.877
Hey, Popcorn, wait up.

20:38.943 --> 20:41.682
Aren't you going to introduce
me to your cute friend?

20:41.749 --> 20:43.352
[laughs]

20:47.059 --> 20:48.830
- He's still out cold.
- [grunts]

20:48.863 --> 20:50.499
- This should do the job.

20:50.534 --> 20:53.439
- I must admit,
I like the way you think.

20:54.374 --> 20:55.577
- What the--
- Oh, my god.

20:55.610 --> 20:57.548
How did a raccoon get in here?
- Oh.

20:57.614 --> 20:59.685
- Whoa. Hey--hey.
- Oh, my god. It's alive.

20:59.752 --> 21:01.288
It's alive.
Do something. Do something.

21:01.354 --> 21:03.192
- Oh, man. Party's over.

21:03.258 --> 21:04.929
All right. [laughs]

21:04.995 --> 21:06.131
Wow.

21:06.164 --> 21:08.202
Looks like humans
aren't really fans.

21:08.268 --> 21:09.672
Here comes my ride.

21:09.738 --> 21:11.609
[screams]

21:11.676 --> 21:12.744
Yeah.

21:12.845 --> 21:13.813
- Wait, Mom.

21:13.847 --> 21:15.082
You're breaking up.

21:15.116 --> 21:16.853
Grandpa dropped Ed?

21:16.886 --> 21:17.855
Who's Ed?

21:17.921 --> 21:18.890
W-- wait, Mom.

21:18.957 --> 21:20.259
Can you hear me now?

21:20.326 --> 21:22.063
Can you hear me now?

21:22.096 --> 21:24.334
Now? Now?

21:24.400 --> 21:25.971
- This is nuts.

21:26.037 --> 21:27.875
[explosion booms]
