WEBVTT

00:03.525 --> 00:04.743
Mistress: <i>Previously on
"The Outpost"...</i>

00:04.787 --> 00:05.657
Talon, you will love
being part of the United.

00:05.701 --> 00:06.745
- United?
- [ screaming ]

00:08.617 --> 00:10.314
Talon,
you should be joining us,
not fighting us.

00:13.361 --> 00:15.406
You've killed her!

00:15.450 --> 00:17.321
No, it's not possible.

00:17.365 --> 00:18.975
[ grunts ]

00:21.238 --> 00:23.197
And what brings you
all this way?

00:23.240 --> 00:25.634
We've come to bring peace
to your village.

00:28.811 --> 00:32.119
We'll find a way to stop
Yavalla from turning us
all into her puppets,

00:32.162 --> 00:33.642
but we need
to do it together.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.732
[ chanting ]
Talon! Talon! Talon!

01:00.321 --> 01:01.452
Keep your distance.

01:05.717 --> 01:07.850
Greetings, friends.

01:07.893 --> 01:09.808
We're looking for
Queen Rosmund.

01:09.852 --> 01:12.072
We believe she
and Baron Aegisford
may have passed this way.

01:12.115 --> 01:15.292
Queen Rosmund
shared her message
of peace with us.

01:15.336 --> 01:18.513
- We were joined with her.
- Well, that confirms it then.

01:18.556 --> 01:20.471
This thing has already
spread throughout the Realm.

01:22.647 --> 01:24.388
You are the traitors.

01:24.432 --> 01:27.043
The traitors
from the Outpost.

01:27.087 --> 01:28.697
We were warned about you.

01:28.740 --> 01:30.916
Should I send in the Lu-Qiri
to kill them all?

01:30.960 --> 01:33.484
Why would we do that?
They haven't done
anything wrong.

01:33.528 --> 01:36.139
- They're possessed.
- They're people.

01:36.183 --> 01:38.794
- We can't just massacre them.
- No, she's right.

01:38.837 --> 01:41.188
None of them chose
to be infected by a kinj.

01:41.231 --> 01:43.146
If we don't do something soon,
they're just gonna spread it
even further.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.669
So we should just go around
killing everyone

01:44.713 --> 01:46.149
unlucky enough to come
in contact with a kinj?

01:46.193 --> 01:48.978
By the looks of things,
you'd have to kill hundreds,

01:49.021 --> 01:52.068
if not thousands
to keep it from spreading.

01:52.112 --> 01:53.722
Greetings, Talon.

01:53.765 --> 01:57.204
Glad to see
you're in good health.

01:57.247 --> 01:59.858
- I don't know you.
- If you could only experience

01:59.902 --> 02:05.081
what it's like
to be united with so many
in complete harmony.

02:05.125 --> 02:08.171
- I tried to share it with you.
- Yavalla.

02:08.215 --> 02:10.478
Wonder how far away she can be
and still talk through them.

02:10.521 --> 02:14.612
There's no distance
I can travel and not be
connected to the United.

02:14.656 --> 02:17.833
Why are you doing this?
These people are innocent.

02:17.876 --> 02:19.965
Their lives were
without meaning.

02:20.009 --> 02:23.099
A never-ending cycle
of poverty,

02:23.143 --> 02:24.753
violence,
and suffering.

02:24.796 --> 02:30.106
Now, they only know
unity and peace.

02:30.150 --> 02:34.850
- This is not peace.
- There's no enmity
between them

02:34.893 --> 02:36.678
and they're happy.

02:36.721 --> 02:40.247
Is that not
the very definition of peace?

02:40.290 --> 02:44.033
I've been watching
Janzo and Wren.

02:44.076 --> 02:46.775
- Janzo was right.
- [ chuckles ]

02:46.818 --> 02:48.603
Would you pass Wren a message,
please?

02:48.646 --> 02:53.477
Tell her I approve
her choice in mate

02:53.521 --> 02:56.959
and I expect them both
to come and join me soon.

02:59.483 --> 03:01.311
We're too late to stop it
from spreading.

03:01.355 --> 03:03.139
This is already out of hand.

03:03.183 --> 03:05.097
We should get back
to the Outpost,

03:05.141 --> 03:06.664
set up a sanctuary
for the uninfected

03:06.708 --> 03:08.231
until Janzo and Wren
can come up with something.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.537
That's a bad idea, Talon.

03:09.580 --> 03:11.278
Do you want
to take charge, Zed?

03:11.321 --> 03:12.583
Because I didn't ask
for the job.

03:12.627 --> 03:15.325
No, no.
People picked you to lead.

03:15.369 --> 03:16.587
Then let me lead.

03:20.939 --> 03:23.942
<i>[ theme music playing ]</i>

03:29.861 --> 03:32.342
<i>[ music playing ]</i>

03:40.045 --> 03:41.090
Postmaster!

03:43.440 --> 03:45.877
- No one got infected out there?
- We had eyes on all.

03:45.921 --> 03:48.924
Seems just a little risky
to let anyone back in
except for Talon and Zed.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.275
How are you feeling today,
Garret?

03:52.319 --> 03:53.755
- Pretty bad.
- Good.

03:53.798 --> 03:57.149
It means you're
not infected... yet.

03:57.193 --> 03:59.108
Send word to Gertrusha
in Aegisford.

03:59.151 --> 04:00.283
Tell them to shut their gates.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.764
They need to go into
complete lockdown.

04:02.807 --> 04:04.287
Should I tell them why?

04:06.898 --> 04:08.987
Tell them there's
a new plague.

04:09.031 --> 04:11.555
And put out word to anyone
who can't lock down their town.

04:11.599 --> 04:13.035
Tell them they can seek refuge
at the Outpost.

04:15.037 --> 04:17.344
Talon, are you sure
that's wise?

04:17.387 --> 04:20.303
Shouldn't we lock our own gates,
not let more people in?

04:20.347 --> 04:23.306
Do we even know if everyone
who's already her is free
of the infection?

04:23.350 --> 04:26.266
- No. No, we don't, do we?
- You both sound like Zed.

04:26.309 --> 04:28.920
We need all the manpower
we can get.

04:28.964 --> 04:31.358
We need to protect as many
uninfected people as we can.

04:31.401 --> 04:33.360
Right, well,
if we're going to allow people
to take refuge here,

04:33.403 --> 04:35.492
we need to figure out
a better way to detect
who's infected.

04:35.536 --> 04:38.016
- So, get on that.
- Sure.

04:38.060 --> 04:40.062
I mean, Wren and I were busy
trying to find a cure,

04:40.105 --> 04:42.064
but I guess we can do
two things at once.

04:42.107 --> 04:44.284
It's not like
there's just two people
down there in the labs

04:44.327 --> 04:46.590
working morning, noon,
and night without any sleep.

04:46.634 --> 04:49.811
I know you'll come through,
Janzo. You always do.

04:52.857 --> 04:56.687
Speaking of which,
Yavalla says she's
been watching you.

04:56.731 --> 05:00.082
Oh, yes. Wren and I think
she's still spying on us
through the rats.

05:00.125 --> 05:03.607
Rats?

05:03.651 --> 05:06.828
[ squeaking ]

05:09.091 --> 05:11.354
Your mother's definitely
watching us through
the rats we caught.

05:11.398 --> 05:13.661
Let her.
Look. See? There!

05:13.704 --> 05:15.358
That's the mechanism
right there.

05:15.402 --> 05:17.708
It reproduces itself.

05:17.752 --> 05:20.581
And now, I bet the rat
is ready to pass it.

05:20.624 --> 05:24.236
It's desperate for contact.

05:24.280 --> 05:25.412
The kinj must be
compelling it,

05:25.455 --> 05:26.978
almost like a person
addicted to drink.

05:27.022 --> 05:28.589
Mm-hmm.
Let's see what happens.

05:40.470 --> 05:42.472
- Amazing.
- That's it.

05:42.516 --> 05:44.387
Start an hourglass.
I need to know exactly how long

05:44.431 --> 05:47.738
this whole reproductive
process takes.

05:47.782 --> 05:49.044
All right.

06:03.014 --> 06:05.147
She was an amazing woman.

06:05.190 --> 06:07.802
- Yeah.
- But I was frightened of her.

06:07.845 --> 06:11.414
Oh, yeah. Me, too.
Never wanted to disappoint her.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.198
Still don't,
just in case she's watching.

06:13.242 --> 06:15.984
Don't need her ghost showing up
to give me a thick ear.

06:19.683 --> 06:23.295
Mm. I'm feeling pretty useless.

06:23.339 --> 06:28.518
- Not much to do
since her Majesty left.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.088
- Hey, do you want a job here?
- Really?

06:33.131 --> 06:36.091
We sure could use the help
since Janzo's so busy sciencing.

06:36.134 --> 06:38.136
Are you allowed
to offer me a job?

06:38.180 --> 06:40.312
Sure. Mum left the place
to Janzo and me.

06:40.356 --> 06:43.359
It's half mine.
I can do--

06:43.403 --> 06:45.709
I can do whatever I want.

06:45.753 --> 06:48.146
All right, I accept.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.800
Welcome to the Nightshade.

06:49.844 --> 06:52.020
We'll have to get you one
of Mum's barmaid outfits

06:52.063 --> 06:54.152
so you look right for the part.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.154
Mum used to say
dresses like that

06:56.198 --> 06:59.157
have a way
of making for bigger tips.

06:59.201 --> 07:00.594
- Never quite understood why.
- [ door opens ]

07:00.637 --> 07:03.118
- I do.
- Janzo: Munt?

07:03.161 --> 07:05.773
There you are.
What's going--

07:05.816 --> 07:07.122
Right. Look, Munt,
I need your help, please.

07:07.165 --> 07:09.690
I need you to go
and catch me some rats.

07:09.733 --> 07:12.475
- Lots and lots of rats.
- Janzo... [ grunts ]

07:12.519 --> 07:15.435
It's for science.
Chop, chop.

07:15.478 --> 07:18.307
[ groans ]
I hate science.

07:18.350 --> 07:20.744
Hey, you want to help me
come catch some rats?

07:20.788 --> 07:23.268
Yeah, you do.
Come on. There.

07:23.312 --> 07:26.446
Oh, yeah.
This will be fun.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.667
I'm telling you, Talon.
You're making a big mistake.

07:30.711 --> 07:34.105
You can't bring more people
in here until we know
they don't have kinjes.

07:34.149 --> 07:37.544
Well, if they aren't acting
all happy and peaceful,
it's a pretty good tip off.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.763
- You can sort of tell,
don't you think?
- Oh.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.548
So you're gonna risk the safety
of everyone in this Outpost

07:41.591 --> 07:43.767
because you can sort of tell.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.987
Well, that's why
we're quarantining them,

07:46.030 --> 07:48.337
to buy us a little time
so Wren and Janzo can come up

07:48.380 --> 07:51.035
with a better way to detect
kinjes or find a cure.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.475
Who are you?
Where are you from?

07:55.518 --> 07:57.651
We are from Landers Mill.

07:57.694 --> 08:01.393
We heard that Outpost
is the only safe place.

08:01.437 --> 08:06.790
Come in.
There's food, water,
and blankets.

08:06.834 --> 08:10.533
Take them to quarantine.

08:10.577 --> 08:13.493
See? Not so hard to spot.

08:18.106 --> 08:19.586
I'm immune to your kinj.

08:19.629 --> 08:22.719
I bring a message
of peace and love.

08:22.763 --> 08:27.855
Not to my Outpost, you don't.
Now leave.

08:27.898 --> 08:30.553
If you won't let me kill him,
we should at least lock him up.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.816
We're going to have a hard
enough time feeding the people
who aren't infected.

08:32.860 --> 08:34.601
He'll just go out there
and infect more people.

08:34.644 --> 08:37.778
Probably,
but at least this way
no one dies.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.782
Now go on, clear off.

08:41.825 --> 08:44.741
And if you go near
any of these people,
I'll cut you down myself.

08:45.829 --> 08:47.744
Go.

08:47.788 --> 08:48.919
No one let him near you.

08:55.317 --> 08:56.797
[ crowd gasping ]

09:13.814 --> 09:15.337
Are you all right?

09:17.905 --> 09:19.907
Any of these people
your parents?

09:19.950 --> 09:23.650
Here. Come with me
to the front of the line.

09:23.693 --> 09:26.870
Talon. This is crazy.

09:26.914 --> 09:30.091
Yes. But I didn't ask to be
making these decisions, okay?

09:30.134 --> 09:32.572
You pushed me into it.
So if you have a better plan,
I'm listening.

09:35.923 --> 09:39.666
There are no good choices, Zed,
just bad and worse.

09:39.709 --> 09:41.798
So until Janzo comes up
with a better solution,

09:41.842 --> 09:44.322
we're saving as many
uninfected people as we can.

09:44.366 --> 09:46.890
If you'd have let me kill
the first batch like I said
when we had the chance,

09:46.934 --> 09:48.675
then we wouldn't be
in this mess.

09:48.718 --> 09:51.547
You're the one who forced me
to summon Yavalla to this world,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.810
so don't be so quick
to judge my decisions now.

09:57.901 --> 10:02.340
Ooh. Yeah, this is nice.
This is gonna be good.

10:02.384 --> 10:05.648
I'll let you have a turn
with the net after this one.

10:05.692 --> 10:08.216
I don't want to hog
all the fun myself.

10:08.259 --> 10:09.870
It's all right.
You go ahead.

10:09.913 --> 10:11.959
Take as many turns
as you like.

10:12.002 --> 10:14.962
Oh, right.

10:15.005 --> 10:17.660
Rats is too low an occupation
for a lady like you.

10:17.704 --> 10:20.184
Have you tried
cleaning chamber pots?

10:20.228 --> 10:21.708
No.

10:23.361 --> 10:25.973
Ooh. There's another one.

10:27.714 --> 10:29.759
Ooh, lots of rats
over here!

10:42.032 --> 10:43.947
[ screaming ]

11:05.447 --> 11:08.102
Looks like a female hand.

11:08.145 --> 11:11.105
Do you think it was murder?

11:11.148 --> 11:13.542
If you see someone walking
around with one hand

11:13.585 --> 11:16.327
and no blood, let me know.

11:16.371 --> 11:20.723
But otherwise, yes.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.072
Yes, I think it was murder.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.205
Well, what happened
to the rest of her?

11:24.248 --> 11:27.774
- It was taken by animals?
- Could be.

11:27.817 --> 11:29.166
You ever seen
that symbol before?

11:29.210 --> 11:33.431
- Yes.
- What is it, Talon?

11:33.475 --> 11:35.651
It was burnt onto a wall
in our village.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.827
Every time they removed it,
it would reappear.

11:37.871 --> 11:39.786
What's it a symbol for?

11:39.829 --> 11:42.571
I don't know.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.660
Every time
I asked my mother about it,

11:44.704 --> 11:47.141
she'd get nervous
and change the subject.

11:47.184 --> 11:50.144
Wonder if whoever
put it on that wall

11:50.187 --> 11:52.973
also put it on this one?

12:00.850 --> 12:05.463
There's at least three sets
of boot prints,

12:05.507 --> 12:09.032
and one,
a crack in the heel.

12:10.512 --> 12:14.951
It looks like
they were stood here

12:14.995 --> 12:17.519
and facing this way.

12:18.650 --> 12:20.478
You're smart with this stuff.

12:20.522 --> 12:22.132
You learned that
from your dad the Marshal?

12:22.176 --> 12:25.222
No. No, I'm no Wythers.

12:25.266 --> 12:27.355
He was a great detective.

12:27.398 --> 12:31.533
You seem to have picked up
a thing or two from him,

12:31.576 --> 12:34.884
which is why I'm putting you
in charge of finding out
who did this.

12:34.928 --> 12:38.148
What? No.
You-- you need my help
with the infection.

12:38.192 --> 12:40.455
How exactly can you help
with that?

12:43.240 --> 12:44.807
All right, point taken.

12:44.851 --> 12:47.984
Munt, do me a favor.
Take that hand to Janzo.

12:48.028 --> 12:50.378
Maybe he can come up
with some ideas.

12:50.421 --> 12:52.815
That is just what Marshal
would have had me done.

12:56.863 --> 12:59.866
I wish he were alive today
to figure this one out.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.651
Something I said?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.830
I don't think he likes
to be reminded of Wythers.

13:07.874 --> 13:09.136
Brings back all his guilt.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.762
Should we maybe
cover up this cage?

13:26.806 --> 13:29.547
- Your mother could be watching.
- Let her.

13:32.420 --> 13:36.554
- Hey, Mother, watch this.
- Hm? Hm?

13:40.776 --> 13:43.387
Yeah, I don't think
she's watching us.

13:43.431 --> 13:47.174
Um, by now there are thousands
that are infected.

13:47.217 --> 13:49.698
I mean,
even the most brilliant mind,
mine for example,

13:49.741 --> 13:51.874
wouldn't be able to sort
the vision from that many eyes

13:51.918 --> 13:54.181
or even the sound
from that many ears.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.574
She must limit
her exposure somehow.

13:56.618 --> 13:59.099
Well, maybe she just tries
to connect to one or two members
of the hive at a time,

13:59.142 --> 14:01.405
just the ones she needs
in that moment.

14:04.887 --> 14:07.629
- How long has it been?
- Almost ten turns of the glass.

14:07.672 --> 14:09.326
That's just over twice a day.

14:09.370 --> 14:11.415
My mathematical predictions
are almost perfect.

14:16.072 --> 14:17.769
Garret wants me
to give you a hand.

14:17.813 --> 14:19.380
Thanks, Munt, but I don't
need a hand right now.

14:19.423 --> 14:22.731
So, even if we say that
four people come into the t--

14:22.774 --> 14:24.820
- [ muttering ]
- No, Munt.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.127
Four of the infected
come into a town.

14:27.170 --> 14:30.521
And then they then pass on
their kinj every time one
becomes infected.

14:30.565 --> 14:32.175
- And that's 16 after a day.
- No, look.

14:32.219 --> 14:35.526
Not now, Munt.
And then after two days, 64.

14:35.570 --> 14:38.268
- No, the thing is--
- And after three days, well,
that's more than 250.

14:38.312 --> 14:40.705
That's more than we can handle.
I mean, 'cause after one week--

14:40.749 --> 14:44.753
65,536. Gods above.

14:44.796 --> 14:46.973
That's more people than even
live in the Capital.

14:47.016 --> 14:48.670
- [ clears throat ]
- Both: What?

14:48.713 --> 14:51.891
- Oh!
- Someone's been murdered.

14:51.934 --> 14:54.023
That's the victim's hand.
Garret says have a look,

14:54.067 --> 14:56.330
- see if you can
find any clues.
- Murdered?

14:56.373 --> 14:59.202
- Who was killed?
- I think that's what Garret
wants you to find out.

14:59.246 --> 15:00.769
- All that's left is that hand.
- No.

15:00.812 --> 15:02.379
No, I don't have time for this.

15:02.423 --> 15:03.946
I'm trying to save
the bloody world!

15:03.990 --> 15:05.905
Well, you tell that
to Garret then.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.385
Right.
You deal with this.

15:08.429 --> 15:09.996
I'll go back to finding a way
to kill the kinj.

15:10.039 --> 15:11.911
Just infect some more rats.

15:11.954 --> 15:15.349
I'll be finished by then
and then we can run
some experiments.

15:18.482 --> 15:19.962
I never thought infecting rats

15:20.006 --> 15:22.965
would be the less disgusting
thing to work on.

15:23.009 --> 15:24.924
[ squeaking ]

15:24.967 --> 15:27.100
Gods, look how eager it is

15:27.143 --> 15:28.318
to pass the kinj on
to the others.

15:28.362 --> 15:29.929
What?

15:32.844 --> 15:36.109
- That's it.
- What's it?

15:38.502 --> 15:40.200
We need a box
with a window on one side.

15:42.724 --> 15:47.207
Wren? You are a genius.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.949
That's what I've been trying
to tell you since we met.

15:54.170 --> 15:55.911
This is ridiculous.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.478
A rat doesn't know
who's infected or not.

15:57.521 --> 15:59.654
It's actually
really quite simple.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.743
The infected rat's
biological imperative is
to keep spreading kinjes.

16:01.786 --> 16:04.050
And this one
is particularly ripe.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.921
So the longer
he doesn't pass it on,
the more pain he's in.

16:05.965 --> 16:07.923
So he's desperate to spread
the kinjes to someone

16:07.967 --> 16:09.533
apart from those
who are already infected.

16:09.577 --> 16:11.318
So the people he ignores
already have a kinj?

16:11.361 --> 16:12.362
Exactly.

16:24.635 --> 16:26.637
[ squeaking ]

16:42.479 --> 16:44.090
[ squeaking stops ]

16:48.137 --> 16:49.138
What's your name?

16:51.445 --> 16:52.446
Lutza.

16:55.275 --> 16:58.191
Get up. Get up now.

16:58.234 --> 17:00.976
You're going to love
being United.

17:01.020 --> 17:02.847
[ crowd screaming ]

17:25.609 --> 17:28.003
Good work, you two.
From now on we use this device

17:28.047 --> 17:29.787
to check every person
before letting them in.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.528
We should check the Outpost
at least once a day.

17:31.572 --> 17:33.400
That's how we stop it
from spreading inside.

17:33.443 --> 17:35.837
Guess we make a few more
of these, then.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.926
Teach the soldiers
how to use them and get them
to check these people again.

17:37.969 --> 17:39.014
- And, Janzo?
- Hm?

17:39.058 --> 17:40.320
Find me a cure.

17:44.150 --> 17:46.195
Easy for her to say.

17:49.198 --> 17:51.026
You know, if you think about it,
maybe it's not so bad.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.594
- What?
- Having one of
Yavalla's kinjes.

17:53.637 --> 17:56.031
I mean, the infected
seem happy and content.

17:56.075 --> 17:59.165
What are you talking about?
They're worse than slaves.

17:59.208 --> 18:01.602
If she wants
to make them do something,
they have no choice.

18:01.645 --> 18:03.169
- Maybe they don't mind it.
- Well, so first you want

18:03.212 --> 18:04.779
to kill them all,
now you want to be one of them.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.650
I guess I'm just struggling
to understand it all, Talon.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.870
Well, I don't want
to understand.

18:08.913 --> 18:11.090
I want to stop her.

18:16.269 --> 18:18.140
Hey, barmaid, more ale.

18:19.315 --> 18:21.361
It's all right.

18:21.404 --> 18:25.147
Oh, I like this world.

18:25.191 --> 18:26.670
I really do.

18:28.194 --> 18:31.414
- Since when does she work here?
- Since I hired her.

18:31.458 --> 18:33.112
I'm boss, too, you know?

18:33.155 --> 18:35.244
Good idea, Munt.
Could use the help around here.

18:39.596 --> 18:41.946
- You were a good idea.
- I was?

18:41.990 --> 18:44.949
- Yeah.
- Wren, quick question for you.

18:44.993 --> 18:46.473
- Janzo?
- Hmm?

18:46.516 --> 18:49.302
Have, um,
have either of you ever seen

18:49.345 --> 18:52.653
this symbol anywhere
in the Outpost before?

18:52.696 --> 18:56.135
No. Why? Does this have
something to do with that
murder you're investigating?

18:56.178 --> 18:59.094
- Yeah. It was all around
the place where it happened.
- I know this symbol.

18:59.138 --> 19:02.141
It belonged to that old cult
that the humans had
before the banishment.

19:02.184 --> 19:03.968
They worshipped
Lu-Qiri as gods.

19:04.012 --> 19:06.145
- Talon said
she recognized it, too.
- Makes sense.

19:06.188 --> 19:07.885
Someone doesn't
understand something,

19:07.929 --> 19:11.454
they just explain it away
with superstitious drivel.

19:11.498 --> 19:13.891
I mean, that's how half
of our religions are explained.

19:13.935 --> 19:17.199
Prime Order,
worshipping The Three?
Perfect example.

19:17.243 --> 19:19.114
They think that
they're these gods.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.768
We know they're just people
with kinjes in their heads.

19:20.811 --> 19:23.771
Yeah, but how would a belief
about Lu-Qiri even exist

19:23.814 --> 19:26.208
when they've been
gone from the Realm for,
what, hundreds of years?

19:26.252 --> 19:28.254
Who knows?
Someone reads an old text,

19:28.297 --> 19:30.865
then meets one of your
lovely little pets.

19:30.908 --> 19:32.997
Mm, not pets.
More like your beasts of burden.

19:33.041 --> 19:36.262
Oh, I do stand corrected.
Either way, wouldn't take much

19:36.305 --> 19:38.655
to rekindle those kinds
of beliefs, would it?

19:38.699 --> 19:42.311
I mean, speaking as a human,
Lu-Qiri? Pretty scary.

19:42.355 --> 19:45.401
- No more than your horses are.
- A lot more than horses.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.750
- All right?
- All right.

19:50.319 --> 19:52.321
Janzo, have you
had a chance to examine--

19:52.365 --> 19:55.498
Gods, scary.
So what is this? Is this--

19:55.542 --> 19:57.935
Have you had a chance to examine
that hand that I brought you?

19:57.979 --> 20:00.808
Oh, yes. Um, sorry.
Probably not going to be
much help, though.

20:00.851 --> 20:03.941
She was a younger woman.
Definitely severed
from the body.

20:03.985 --> 20:07.902
A sharp object, heavy blade.
Maybe an axe.

20:07.945 --> 20:11.732
Oh, also,
there was a little bit
of blue dye on her wrist,

20:11.775 --> 20:13.429
maybe from a bit of clothing.

20:13.473 --> 20:15.692
Could that be of any help?

20:17.651 --> 20:20.131
Maybe, actually.

20:28.227 --> 20:29.924
I thought Janzo proved these
people aren't infected.

20:29.967 --> 20:31.665
Why are they still quarantined?

20:31.708 --> 20:35.451
They're not.
They just have
nowhere else to go.

20:35.495 --> 20:39.977
Great. They're free to come
and go as they please.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.328
Maybe do
a little blood sacrifice,
be back in time for dinner.

20:42.371 --> 20:45.505
- Show me your wrist, please.
- So you agree with Zed?

20:45.548 --> 20:48.159
You think I should've
just let these people
out there to be infected?

20:48.203 --> 20:52.555
No, I-- I'm not sure, Talon.
Right? Show me your wrist.

20:55.515 --> 20:58.300
- What are you looking for?
- Blue dye. Let me see
your wrist.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.998
It's all we have to go on.
It was on the wrist
of the hand that we found.

21:01.042 --> 21:06.221
- Show me your wrist.
- Look, can I just say
I hate being in charge?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.398
I'd much rather someone else
be making the hard decisions.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.623
I think you're doing
a damn good job.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.485
[ gasping ]

21:56.010 --> 21:58.491
[ grunting ]

21:58.534 --> 22:01.102
[ muffled screaming ]

22:02.538 --> 22:04.410
I've searched for any remnants,
attach points,

22:04.453 --> 22:06.629
anything like that
inside this poor man's head

22:06.673 --> 22:09.153
to seen if we can even find
an avenue to attack the kinjes.

22:09.197 --> 22:12.331
But there's not even
the slightest sign there was
ever even a kinj in there.

22:12.374 --> 22:14.289
Which is consistent with what
we've been finding in the rats.

22:14.333 --> 22:17.248
We've tried several times
to cut a kinj
out of a living rat.

22:17.292 --> 22:19.294
Just like Reb tried
to do to you, actually.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.253
And just like yours did,
the kinj, it keeps
moving and hiding.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.691
We end up just cutting
the whole rat apart
just to dig it out.

22:24.734 --> 22:27.258
Which then kills it.
Once the rat dies,

22:27.302 --> 22:30.087
the kinj expels itself and,
um, instantly dissolves.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.438
It's like kill the rats,
kill the kinj.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.962
Just like we've seen
in humans so far.

22:35.005 --> 22:37.399
So the only way to stop it
is to still kill the infected.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.271
- So far.
- Well, that's not
an acceptable solution.

22:40.315 --> 22:43.579
I'm not killing Gwynn,
much less thousands
of innocent people.

22:43.623 --> 22:47.409
We've already proven
that we can't remove the kinj
from a living host.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.760
Now we just need to find out
how to kill it while
it's still in the host.

22:50.804 --> 22:52.153
Without killing the host,
of course.

22:52.196 --> 22:54.111
- Mm.
- So do that.

22:54.155 --> 22:56.026
Whatever she said.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.107
Warlita never showed up
for work last night.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.199
I found this
in the back alley.

23:38.242 --> 23:41.158
It's her brooch.

23:41.202 --> 23:44.379
I'm starting to get worried.

23:44.423 --> 23:46.773
Well, I'm sure she's fine.

23:49.732 --> 23:52.474
Captain Spears,
a body has been found.

23:52.518 --> 23:54.824
Oh, no.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.576
What a relief.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.666
Munt, a woman has died.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.713
Yeah, but it's not Warlita.

24:13.756 --> 24:16.106
No, it's Dunlee Page.

24:16.150 --> 24:18.500
I'm sure she's not as happy
about this as you are.

24:18.544 --> 24:22.765
- You knew her?
- I only met her once.

24:22.809 --> 24:25.028
She's the stableman's
oldest daughter.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.816
And there's our symbol again.

24:33.602 --> 24:35.648
Why weren't there men
posted out here already?

24:35.691 --> 24:40.783
How was I supposed to know
that they would do this again
in the same place?

24:40.827 --> 24:43.786
Marshal Wythers
would have known that.

24:43.830 --> 24:46.267
Yes, he would, Munt!

24:46.310 --> 24:49.400
Yes, he would,
but my father didn't teach me
his trade before I--

24:49.444 --> 24:51.794
It's all right.

24:51.838 --> 24:53.970
You're doing your best.

24:54.014 --> 24:56.973
Next time you'll have
a man here.

24:57.017 --> 24:58.322
I'm sorry.

25:17.733 --> 25:19.692
It's the same crack
in the heel.

25:19.735 --> 25:21.955
He was here watching.

25:28.657 --> 25:30.311
Garret.

25:36.883 --> 25:39.625
These are Lu-Qiri tracks.

25:39.668 --> 25:41.757
They stop here
and then turn back.

25:41.801 --> 25:44.630
Garret: Talon, you said
that demons can smell blood

25:44.673 --> 25:48.068
from miles away.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.070
It was coming to feed
on this woman

25:50.113 --> 25:52.899
while crack heel
stood there and watched.

25:55.815 --> 26:00.254
They're not just
sacrificing these women.

26:00.297 --> 26:02.691
They're feeding them
to Lu-Qiri.

26:07.957 --> 26:11.657
Well, it can't be a Lu-Qiri
under Blackblood control.

26:11.700 --> 26:14.964
They eat meat,
but they would never eat
humans or Blackbloods.

26:15.008 --> 26:18.402
There must be a masterless
Lu-Qiri on the loose.

26:18.446 --> 26:20.579
Do you think they have
Warlita?

26:25.627 --> 26:28.587
<i>[ music playing ]</i>

26:36.638 --> 26:39.293
- What are you doing?
- I don't know.

26:39.336 --> 26:42.165
That's really the problem,
isn't it?

26:42.209 --> 26:46.126
I mean, like you said,
I was the one that brought
Yavalla into this world.

26:46.169 --> 26:49.477
I did it to save our people,
but now even if you agreed
to open that portal,

26:49.520 --> 26:51.218
I wouldn't bring
the rest of them through.

26:51.261 --> 26:54.525
- Better off where they are.
- Are you finished whining?

26:57.572 --> 27:00.401
I need your help.
A Lu-Qiri is eating humans.

27:00.444 --> 27:01.445
We need to find it.

27:03.317 --> 27:04.884
Xaba.

27:04.927 --> 27:08.017
Xaba?
Is that Yobahn's Lu-Qiri?

27:08.061 --> 27:10.890
Since Yobahn died,
she's masterless.

27:10.933 --> 27:13.153
Does that mean anyone
can claim her?

27:13.196 --> 27:16.199
Yes, but no one wants to.

27:16.243 --> 27:18.898
The best thing you could do
is line up a few ballistas
and take her down.

27:18.941 --> 27:22.031
She's a rotten Lu-Qiri.

27:22.075 --> 27:23.990
Her master was bad,
but she's always been vicious.

27:24.033 --> 27:26.601
Dangerous.

27:26.645 --> 27:28.995
She killed a child
in the Plane of Ashes.

27:29.038 --> 27:33.173
Yobahn denied it, of course,
but we all knew who it was.

27:33.216 --> 27:35.958
Xaba's a lost cause.

27:36.002 --> 27:38.265
Isn't that what you told me
about that first demon I met?

27:38.308 --> 27:40.746
Baphnoro? I tamed him.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.965
He was wild.

27:43.009 --> 27:45.446
Xaba was trained
to be malicious.

27:46.969 --> 27:48.971
You can't save her, Talon.

27:49.015 --> 27:52.583
I'm going to try.
So are you going to
help me or not?

27:52.627 --> 27:54.455
Of course,
by talking you out of it.

27:54.498 --> 27:55.891
I'm going with or without you.

27:58.459 --> 28:02.245
Look, if you want
to tame that beast,

28:02.289 --> 28:04.683
you're going to have
to be meaner and tougher
than Yobahn ever was.

28:04.726 --> 28:07.816
- You think you can manage that?
- I'm alive and he's dead.

28:07.860 --> 28:10.427
What do you think?

28:10.471 --> 28:13.126
All right.
Let's go see Orrin.

28:15.302 --> 28:16.825
Who's Orrin?

28:16.869 --> 28:19.567
The Blackfist
who has Yobahn's ring,

28:19.610 --> 28:22.309
the whistle
that will summon Xaba.

28:26.095 --> 28:27.662
You're wanted for murder.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.708
Hey, I never murdered anyone.

28:32.362 --> 28:34.887
You've been feeding people
to Yobahn's Lu-Qiri.

28:34.930 --> 28:37.803
What?
You must be drunker than I am.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.283
- [ chuckles ]
- Where's the ring?

28:40.327 --> 28:42.677
Where's the ring
that summons Yobahn's demon?

28:42.721 --> 28:44.461
I sold it.

28:44.505 --> 28:45.767
For a good price, I might add.

28:45.811 --> 28:48.727
- Sold it to who?
- Don't know.

28:48.770 --> 28:52.426
He covered his face.
It was at nighttime.
No idea who he was.

28:56.212 --> 29:00.477
Is he really
feeding humans to Xaba?

29:00.521 --> 29:01.783
I thought
he'd blow that whistle

29:01.827 --> 29:04.264
and be dead before
he knew what hit him.

29:04.307 --> 29:08.355
Guess he's more clever
than I took him for.

29:12.054 --> 29:14.056
I'm going after Xaba.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.885
And how do we even find her?

29:16.929 --> 29:19.148
I'm going to track her.

29:29.332 --> 29:31.204
You're right.
Lots of dye here.

29:31.247 --> 29:34.033
Garret:
Look for blue dye.

29:43.564 --> 29:46.654
Sorry, sorry.
We're looking for a woman
who was brought into here.

29:46.697 --> 29:49.439
She's young, blonde hair.
She's the Queen's handmaiden.

they're Xaba's?

31:12.174 --> 31:14.524
Dried blood,

31:14.568 --> 31:16.962
probably from that
poor girl's missing hand.

31:24.491 --> 31:26.972
I like this.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.756
You and I together again,

odds stacked against us,

31:30.801 --> 31:31.977
off on an adventure.

31:32.020 --> 31:34.196
We're not together again.

She had her chance
and she didn't.

32:41.742 --> 32:44.745
She won't kill me.

32:46.225 --> 32:49.750
So what now?

32:49.793 --> 32:53.797
Next time I try something
that she's probably
never seen from a master.

Good luck with that.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.400

You know how hard
that is for a Lu-Qiri?

38:37.445 --> 38:40.056

No, beautiful girl like that

41:00.240 --> 41:02.068
Why are we looking
at a dead rat?

41:02.111 --> 41:04.592
This rat?
A couple of days ago,
perfectly fit and healthy.

41:04.636 --> 41:08.204
The whole first generation
is rapidly aging and dying.

41:08.248 --> 41:09.989
And you think
the kinjes caused this?

41:10.032 --> 41:12.426
Each time a kinj multiplies,
it takes life out of the host.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.994
Rats are smaller than humans,
so the effect is more
pronounced and rapid.

41:15.037 --> 41:18.301
What are you saying?
That this is happening
to people, too?

41:18.345 --> 41:20.782
- Afraid so.
- The first person
to get one of these

41:20.826 --> 41:23.785
- from Yavalla was Gwynn.
- Unfortunately.

41:23.829 --> 41:27.223
And every time
she passes a kinj,

41:27.267 --> 41:28.616
she loses a little more
of herself.

41:28.660 --> 41:30.879
How long does she have
before she's like this?

41:30.923 --> 41:33.142
She has a body mass of what?
I don't know, 100 rats?

41:33.186 --> 41:37.364
- How long?
- The first 20 or 30 days,
she'll be wasting away.

41:37.407 --> 41:40.802
Um, and a couple more?

41:40.846 --> 41:42.412
She'll be dead.

41:44.632 --> 41:46.460
Janzo, are you
any closer to a cure?

41:46.504 --> 41:50.072
- We've been trying for days.
- We need more time, Talon.

41:50.116 --> 41:52.466
You have three more days.
