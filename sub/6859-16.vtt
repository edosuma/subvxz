Fugitives on the run.

00:19.121 --> 00:21.722
Disguised as Jedi
killer Rako Hardeen,

00:21.822 --> 00:23.758
Obi-Wan Kenobi works undercover

00:23.858 --> 00:25.260
to solve a separatist plot

00:25.360 --> 00:27.361
against chancellor Palpatine.

00:27.461 --> 00:29.197
Obi-Wan meets the plot's mastermind,

00:29.297 --> 00:32.167
Moralo Eval, breaking him out of jail

00:32.267 --> 00:33.768
to gain his trust.

00:33.868 --> 00:36.469
But now Kenobi faces
another obstacle,

00:36.569 --> 00:39.006
bounty hunter Cad Bane.

00:39.106 --> 00:42.542
Can Obi-Wan Kenobi
overcome Bane's suspicions

00:42.642 --> 00:44.178
or will the ruthless criminal

00:44.278 --> 00:47.147
see through his disguise
and expose the Jedi?

00:47.247 --> 00:49.049
Only time will tell.

00:50.650 --> 00:52.885
You're coming in too fast, Hardeen.

00:52.985 --> 00:54.287
Are you trying to kill us?

00:54.387 --> 00:56.722
They'll be waiting for
us in every space port.

00:56.822 --> 00:58.424
We have to ditch the ship.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.028
You mean you're going to
intentionally crash us

01:02.128 --> 01:03.529
into the swamp?

01:03.629 --> 01:06.665
Yeah, that is exactly
what I'm gonna do.

01:06.765 --> 01:07.666
He's right.

01:07.766 --> 01:09.267
We have no choice.

01:09.367 --> 01:11.618
Get ready for a fast exit.

01:53.142 --> 01:54.577
Nobody can trace us here.

01:54.677 --> 01:56.478
The swamp will swallow up the ship.

01:56.578 --> 02:00.115
So we leave no trace of our crash.

02:00.215 --> 02:03.884
Moralo Eval likes a
man who plans ahead.

02:08.223 --> 02:11.226
You do have a plan?

02:11.326 --> 02:13.861
Yeah, I know Nal Hutta.

02:13.961 --> 02:16.697
We can get a new ship
at Bilbousa bazaar.

02:16.797 --> 02:18.699
But this time, we buy one.

02:18.799 --> 02:20.368
Otherwise, we'll have the authorities

02:20.468 --> 02:21.668
back on our tail.

02:21.768 --> 02:23.237
Not so fast.

02:23.337 --> 02:26.140
We need to ditch these
prison fatigues.

02:26.240 --> 02:28.975
We'll have a bounty on
our heads for escaping.

02:29.075 --> 02:31.943
And I don't like to stand out.

02:51.030 --> 02:53.399
That's local security.

02:53.499 --> 02:55.433
Keeping moving.

03:03.408 --> 03:05.977
We'll get some new
gear and equipment.

03:06.077 --> 03:09.314
Pablo's pawn shop has everything

03:09.414 --> 03:12.061
a bounty hunter needs and more.

03:26.296 --> 03:28.230
Now all I need's a new hat.

03:34.103 --> 03:36.405
For trying to blend in,
your hat sure makes you

03:36.505 --> 03:39.475
stand out.

03:39.575 --> 03:42.711
I don't like to hide under a helmet.

03:42.811 --> 03:45.848
Is there anything
else you desire, huh?

03:45.948 --> 03:47.283
A new ship?

03:47.383 --> 03:50.418
Your choice of weapons
is lousy, Pablo.

03:50.518 --> 03:53.388
Where can I get some
quality blasters?

03:53.488 --> 03:55.023
I wouldn't be too picky,

03:55.123 --> 03:58.098
being on the run like
you obviously are.

04:00.861 --> 04:04.264
I'd keep my mouth shut
if I were you, Pablo.

04:04.364 --> 04:06.783
We'll get our weapons elsewhere.

04:09.069 --> 04:12.106
Thanks for the hat.

04:12.206 --> 04:13.140
For your trouble.

04:19.678 --> 04:22.348
That trader's heard worse
threats than yours, Bane.

04:22.448 --> 04:23.449
Probably calling the Hutts

04:23.549 --> 04:24.717
right now, seeing what kind of

04:24.817 --> 04:26.010
bounty there is on us.

04:31.424 --> 04:32.625
Relax.

04:32.725 --> 04:36.028
In this slime pool,
everybody's an outlaw.

04:36.128 --> 04:39.031
Besides, they'll be
looking for three of us,

04:39.131 --> 04:40.332
so we're splitting up.

04:40.432 --> 04:41.933
You find a ship.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.598
We'll get weapons.

04:44.402 --> 04:45.937
Not so fast.

04:46.037 --> 04:47.939
If it's all the same to you,

04:48.039 --> 04:49.641
I'll get the weapons.

04:49.741 --> 04:51.709
It's not the same to me.

04:51.809 --> 04:53.610
You crashed the ship.

04:53.710 --> 04:55.498
You get us a new one.

04:59.283 --> 05:01.751
It does seem fair.

05:06.089 --> 05:09.659
Soon as we have a ship,
we ditch Hardeen.

05:09.759 --> 05:11.361
Really?

05:11.461 --> 05:12.795
We'll throw him to the Hutts.

05:12.895 --> 05:15.932
While they interrogate
him, we'll be long gone.

05:16.032 --> 05:21.492
Tell me, is this
business or personal?

05:23.072 --> 05:25.006
Both.

05:36.351 --> 05:38.487
No. That's my final offer.

05:49.798 --> 05:52.000
All right, then.
It's a deal.

05:52.100 --> 05:53.468
Oh, good timing.

05:53.568 --> 05:55.670
As soon as you pay for the ship,
we can get moving.

05:55.770 --> 05:57.416
With pleasure.

05:58.839 --> 06:00.674
Hey, where's my weapon?

06:00.774 --> 06:02.242
Won't need it.

06:02.342 --> 06:03.677
You're not coming.

06:03.777 --> 06:06.113
Says who?

06:06.213 --> 06:07.214
He doesn't want to split

06:07.314 --> 06:10.751
his fee for breaking
me out of prison.

06:10.851 --> 06:13.785
And also, he despises you.

06:14.386 --> 06:16.589
All I know is, I'm not going anywhere

06:16.689 --> 06:18.324
without my reward.

06:18.424 --> 06:21.728
I'm sorry.
This is between you two.

06:21.828 --> 06:24.396
What's it gonna be, Bane?

06:31.069 --> 06:33.071
Here's your reward:

06:33.171 --> 06:34.740
I'm not killing you.

06:34.840 --> 06:35.407
Ah!

06:35.507 --> 06:36.208
Ah.

06:36.308 --> 06:36.875
Ugh.

06:36.975 --> 06:38.177
Ugh!

06:58.205 --> 07:00.307
Where am I?

07:00.407 --> 07:02.975
You are a guest of the Hutts.

07:03.075 --> 07:05.578
If you do not answer
my questions about

07:05.678 --> 07:08.747
your two partners...

07:08.847 --> 07:11.850
We will not be so hospitable.

07:11.950 --> 07:14.052
Ugh!

07:16.488 --> 07:18.615
You call this "hospitable"?

07:20.024 --> 07:20.925
Wait.

07:21.025 --> 07:22.393
Torture won't be necessary.

07:22.493 --> 07:23.828
My partners double-crossed me,

07:23.928 --> 07:27.198
but I put a tracking
device on their ship.

07:27.298 --> 07:30.934
Let me down and I'll
tell you the frequency.

07:33.237 --> 07:35.172
Ugh!

07:35.272 --> 07:38.729
Now tell us the tracking frequency.

07:44.414 --> 07:45.982
Yes, Count Dooku.

07:46.082 --> 07:48.285
I'm sorry I was delayed.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.285
I'm free now.

07:49.385 --> 07:52.355
I'll try to reach Serenno
as soon as possible.

07:52.455 --> 07:55.057
No more excuses, Eval.

07:55.157 --> 07:57.293
Time is running short.

07:57.393 --> 07:58.761
Yes, Count Dooku.

07:58.861 --> 08:01.121
No more excuses.

08:02.197 --> 08:04.534
You said it yourself, Eval.

08:04.634 --> 08:06.334
You're free now.

08:06.434 --> 08:08.069
I want my money.

08:08.169 --> 08:10.472
After the weapons and the ship.

08:10.572 --> 08:12.674
I have very few credits left.

08:12.774 --> 08:15.143
You will be paid when
we reach Serenno.

08:20.315 --> 08:21.215
What is this?

08:21.315 --> 08:22.550
Who's attacking us?

08:22.650 --> 08:24.017
The Hutts.

08:24.117 --> 08:25.919
How did they find us so quickly?

08:26.019 --> 08:29.190
Hardeen trying to even the score.

08:32.393 --> 08:33.227
The engines are fried.

08:33.327 --> 08:35.395
We'll have to turn back.

08:41.866 --> 08:44.203
Their ship will crash
soon on Nal Hutta.

08:44.304 --> 08:46.206
Be there to capture the fugitives.

08:50.009 --> 08:51.002
You found the ship like I said.

08:52.978 --> 08:55.747
Our deal was, you'll let me go now.

08:55.847 --> 08:58.883
The deal has changed.

09:15.666 --> 09:17.600
Ugh!

09:43.325 --> 09:44.393
This is Ben.

09:44.493 --> 09:46.428
I apologize for being
out of communication,

09:46.528 --> 09:49.632
but the situation was rather tenuous.

09:49.732 --> 09:51.767
Although, it now appears

09:51.867 --> 09:53.736
things may be on track soon.

09:53.836 --> 09:55.036
Here is what I need.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.037
Have the bounty hunters removed.

09:56.137 --> 09:59.440
If I can win over Cad
Bane, I can learn more

09:59.540 --> 10:01.142
about Eval's plot.

10:01.242 --> 10:03.844
But there can be no
more complications.

10:03.944 --> 10:05.280
So no matter what reports

10:05.380 --> 10:08.436
you hear, do not contact
me or send help.

10:10.351 --> 10:12.453
Oh, and one more thing.

10:12.553 --> 10:14.942
I shall need enough credits
to buy a new ship.

10:18.892 --> 10:20.594
Why are you removing the bounty

10:20.694 --> 10:22.496
on the three fugitives?

10:22.596 --> 10:23.463
If they're free to move,

10:23.563 --> 10:25.899
they could lead us back
to Eval's operation.

10:25.999 --> 10:26.900
Very well.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.050
Keep me apprised.

10:31.036 --> 10:32.612
You looked troubled, Anakin.

10:33.539 --> 10:35.608
How can they expect me

10:35.708 --> 10:37.443
to just sit here and do nothing

10:37.543 --> 10:39.779
with Obi-Wan's murderer on the loose?

10:39.879 --> 10:42.381
It is possible that
they do not trust you

10:42.481 --> 10:44.602
to control your feelings.

10:46.117 --> 10:49.631
Hardeen Killed my
master, my best friend.

10:50.354 --> 10:52.990
And now he's escaping
with Cad Bane and Moralo Eval,

10:53.090 --> 10:55.987
and the Jedi council
won't do anything about it.

10:56.795 --> 10:58.863
I have it from a reliable source

10:58.963 --> 11:01.465
that the fugitives were last headed

11:01.565 --> 11:04.668
towards Nal Hutta.

11:04.768 --> 11:07.805
You cannot deny your
feelings, Anakin.

11:07.905 --> 11:10.334
They are what make you special.

11:11.107 --> 11:12.543
If you believe you can

11:12.643 --> 11:16.463
stop this plot against
me, I trust you.

11:17.480 --> 11:19.349
Thank you, chancellor.

11:19.449 --> 11:20.758
You won't regret this.

11:22.985 --> 11:25.420
No, I won't.

11:29.024 --> 11:31.760
Ah, back so soon?

11:38.433 --> 11:39.668
Let me guess;

11:39.768 --> 11:41.036
you missed me.

11:44.198 --> 11:45.240
Watch it!

11:45.340 --> 11:48.710
Kill me and you won't
get off Nal Hutta.

11:48.810 --> 11:51.645
Moralo Eval is running out of time

11:51.745 --> 11:53.381
and patience.

11:53.481 --> 11:56.584
Let the man talk.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.703
Look, I've got a ship.

12:00.823 --> 12:02.290
You've got the Hutts on your tail,

12:02.390 --> 12:05.860
so you make me a
partner in everything.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.048
Your deal is accepted.

12:10.563 --> 12:11.531
No.

12:11.631 --> 12:14.567
First, I want to know
where you got the credits

12:14.667 --> 12:16.270
to buy a ship.

12:16.370 --> 12:18.705
You thought you left me for dead.

12:18.805 --> 12:20.673
But the Hutts owed me a favor.

12:20.773 --> 12:23.542
So you had them shoot us down?

12:23.642 --> 12:25.644
You would've done the
same thing, Bane.

12:25.744 --> 12:28.347
The way I see it, we're even now.

12:28.447 --> 12:31.650
Now that we're all
friends, get me off

12:31.750 --> 12:34.146
this festering stink-hole.

12:37.956 --> 12:40.325
Wait, who's going to
pay for this mess?

12:40.425 --> 12:41.337
Gah!

12:44.962 --> 12:47.065
So about your fee from Eval:

12:47.165 --> 12:50.335
A 50/50 split sounds fair to me.

12:50.435 --> 12:53.171
Over my dead corpse.

12:53.271 --> 12:54.894
Don't tempt me.

13:05.182 --> 13:06.817
What makes you think
Obi-Wan's murderer

13:06.917 --> 13:08.052
is on Nal Hutta?

13:08.152 --> 13:11.086
I got a tip from the
chancellor himself.

13:13.423 --> 13:15.191
How are we gonna find them?

13:15.291 --> 13:16.625
Ahsoka, you should know

13:16.725 --> 13:19.528
by now, if you want
to find a lowlife...

13:19.628 --> 13:21.563
You start at the saloon.

13:30.405 --> 13:34.443
Hey, ladies, where are we going next?

13:34.543 --> 13:37.445
I love you guys.

13:55.229 --> 13:57.764
The fugitives are already gone.

13:57.864 --> 13:59.366
All three of them were here?

13:59.466 --> 14:01.634
Two came in, met the third.

14:01.734 --> 14:03.169
When did they leave?

14:03.269 --> 14:05.605
Nothing's free on Nal Hutta,

14:05.705 --> 14:07.273
especially information.

14:07.373 --> 14:10.243
I don't have time for games.

14:11.010 --> 14:12.912
You just missed them.

14:13.012 --> 14:14.413
Keep talking.

14:14.513 --> 14:15.747
I heard one of them say

14:15.847 --> 14:17.149
they just bought a ship.

14:20.352 --> 14:22.286
Let's go, snips.

14:30.839 --> 14:32.307
Captain Rex, I need to speak

14:32.407 --> 14:33.441
with General Skywalker.

14:33.541 --> 14:35.376
He's not responding to my calls.

14:35.476 --> 14:38.779
Sir, General Skywalker
is unavailable.

14:38.879 --> 14:40.615
Where is he, captain?

14:40.715 --> 14:42.483
I can't say, sir.

14:42.583 --> 14:45.253
You can't or you won't?

14:45.353 --> 14:47.387
Anakin is on Nal Hutta.

14:48.622 --> 14:49.771
Nal Hutta?

14:49.891 --> 14:52.326
Protecting me is only
postponing the problem,

14:52.426 --> 14:53.893
not solving it.

14:53.993 --> 14:56.363
With all due respect, chancellor,

14:56.463 --> 14:57.997
the council has a plan in place.

14:58.097 --> 15:01.335
Yes, and so does Moralo
Eval, who appears to be

15:01.435 --> 15:03.336
several steps ahead of you.

15:03.436 --> 15:06.372
For that reason, I asked
Anakin to take action.

15:06.472 --> 15:08.441
He is confident he can
find the fugitives

15:08.541 --> 15:11.143
and stop this plot against me.

15:11.243 --> 15:14.658
I suggest you have more faith
in young Skywalker.

15:15.881 --> 15:17.783
Captain, if you must escort me

15:17.883 --> 15:20.084
home, I'm leaving now.

15:20.184 --> 15:20.674
Yes, sir.

15:21.886 --> 15:25.123
This is exactly what Obi-Wan
didn't want to happen.

15:25.223 --> 15:28.025
If I warn him, it
could blow his cover,

15:28.125 --> 15:29.294
get him killed.

15:29.394 --> 15:30.595
Hmm.

15:30.695 --> 15:33.030
Kill Hardeen, Skywalker might.

15:33.130 --> 15:35.179
Or die trying he may.

15:36.166 --> 15:37.735
Warn them both, you must.

15:37.835 --> 15:40.056
Overdue the truth is.

15:51.181 --> 15:53.082
How do you know they couldn't
have gotten very far?

15:54.717 --> 15:56.619
So you only gave them
enough fuel to reach

15:56.719 --> 15:58.388
the nearest filling
station, on Orondia,

15:58.488 --> 16:00.189
which is owned by your brother?

16:01.391 --> 16:03.993
Well, that's a nice,
little money-making scam.

16:04.093 --> 16:05.161
We'd better get going.

16:05.261 --> 16:07.029
Orondia's pretty deserted.

16:07.129 --> 16:09.985
They may steal a ship there
to throw us off their trail.

16:10.432 --> 16:12.366
I like your thinking.

16:27.481 --> 16:28.849
Here, take it.

16:28.949 --> 16:30.855
I just want to get out of here.

16:32.219 --> 16:33.220
We're being swindled.

16:33.320 --> 16:35.423
Who sells a ship with
only enough fuel

16:35.523 --> 16:37.591
to get to this lousy rock?

16:37.691 --> 16:41.928
The way I see it, you keep paying off
everybody but me.

16:42.028 --> 16:43.962
Yeah, why is that?

16:58.343 --> 16:59.845
Look, it's Cad Bane.

16:59.945 --> 17:00.679
Are you sure?

17:00.779 --> 17:03.248
Ugh, who else wears a hat like that?

17:03.348 --> 17:05.281
Good point.

17:14.459 --> 17:15.992
Now what?

17:16.093 --> 17:18.027
Jedi.

17:38.715 --> 17:39.516
Take over!

17:39.616 --> 17:41.617
I'll bring 'em down.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.726
Ah!

17:53.428 --> 17:55.531
I'll take care of him.

17:55.631 --> 17:58.565
No, it's my turn to kill a Jedi.

18:12.647 --> 18:14.416
Ugh!

18:14.516 --> 18:16.448
Wha!

18:22.455 --> 18:24.390
Ugh-uh.

18:28.862 --> 18:30.796
Ugh.

18:34.166 --> 18:36.100
Ha!

18:39.071 --> 18:41.072
Uh!

18:44.877 --> 18:46.811
Huh-uh!

19:02.360 --> 19:03.562
Ah!

19:03.662 --> 19:04.795
Ugh!

19:07.198 --> 19:09.132
Oh-uh!

19:10.801 --> 19:12.735
Uh-oh!

19:16.407 --> 19:18.609
Ugh.

19:18.709 --> 19:20.642
Anakin.

19:46.034 --> 19:47.969
Ugh!

19:49.771 --> 19:52.374
You're going to pay for what you did.

19:52.474 --> 19:53.041
Ruh!

19:53.141 --> 19:54.675
You shouldn't have gotten involved.

19:54.775 --> 19:55.977
Ah!

19:56.077 --> 19:57.524
Ah!

19:58.713 --> 20:00.215
This is for Obi-Wan.

20:02.317 --> 20:05.120
You can thank me later, Hardeen.

20:07.021 --> 20:09.656
You had your chance to kill him.

20:09.756 --> 20:11.258
Now it's my turn.

20:11.358 --> 20:13.292
Yah!

20:28.807 --> 20:30.809
Uh!

20:30.909 --> 20:32.512
Rah!

20:32.612 --> 20:35.048
Ugh!

20:35.148 --> 20:38.284
Ugh.

20:41.319 --> 20:44.255
Anakin, don't follow me.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.053
Ah-ah!

21:02.239 --> 21:04.508
Ship is still operational.

21:04.608 --> 21:05.509
I got it working.

21:05.609 --> 21:07.445
Now let's get out of here.

21:07.545 --> 21:10.565
You're lucky we're in
a hurry, little lady.

21:11.982 --> 21:15.350
We'll have to dance another time.

21:20.404 --> 21:21.567
Master.

21:21.791 --> 21:23.694
Master, are you all right?

21:25.562 --> 21:26.936
Mm.

21:35.604 --> 21:36.405
What is it?

21:36.505 --> 21:37.839
What's wrong?

21:37.939 --> 21:40.976
That's why I felt a connection.

21:41.076 --> 21:43.312
Obi-Wan is still alive.

21:43.412 --> 21:45.179
I-I-I don't understand.

21:45.279 --> 21:46.447
I don't either.

21:46.547 --> 21:48.249
But we're gonna get to
the bottom of this,

21:48.349 --> 21:50.283
believe me.
