01:15.114 --> 01:27.018
During the nation's early years, powers compete to conquer China,
each furthering their own military reach and empire.
Warlords big and small side with foreigners at the expense of the people.
Endless battles turn the land into hell on earth.

01:32.024 --> 01:36.519
Dengfeng, Henan.

01:45.279 --> 01:46.280
Amitabha.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.098
Amitabha.

02:50.603 --> 02:52.104
Brother, we have a live one here.

03:01.794 --> 03:02.625
Wake up!

03:03.125 --> 03:03.926
Wake up!

03:09.812 --> 03:11.143
Quickly! Don't let them escape!

03:21.253 --> 03:22.164
After them!

03:37.869 --> 03:39.671
Kill! Leave not one!

04:14.936 --> 04:16.677
Sir, eat it slowly.

04:28.799 --> 04:29.870
Eat it while it's hot.

04:29.941 --> 04:30.701
Thank you.

04:32.243 --> 04:33.704
Brother, yet another two hundred arrive.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.476
Jingkong, winter will come soon.

04:36.377 --> 04:38.489
Before the blizzards reach the mountain,
we must build more shelters.

04:38.949 --> 04:40.451
We've already run out of wood and straw.

04:40.491 --> 04:41.962
What else do you want me to build with?

04:42.122 --> 04:44.225
Then take what we can out of our rooms
and give it to these people.

04:45.266 --> 04:46.737
No way, I am deathly afraid of the cold.

04:48.909 --> 04:51.532
Look at these mantou,
each day it gets smaller and smaller.

04:53.143 --> 04:54.355
So we needn't worry about freezing to death.

04:55.155 --> 04:56.356
Even before winter arrives,

04:57.788 --> 04:58.989
You will have already starved to death.

05:14.254 --> 05:15.054
After him!

05:29.219 --> 05:29.993
Search!

05:39.169 --> 05:39.909
Come out!

05:46.085 --> 05:47.287
Out of the way! Bring him out!

06:01.682 --> 06:04.150
- Stop!
- Don't move!

06:04.281 --> 06:07.229
- You! Over here!
- Stop! Don't move!

06:08.265 --> 06:09.628
- Don't move!
- Don't move!

06:20.778 --> 06:21.611
Out of the way!

06:21.710 --> 06:22.613
Out of the way!

06:29.138 --> 06:30.009
You can't enter!

06:30.039 --> 06:31.040
Stop!

06:33.182 --> 06:34.043
You can't enter!

06:34.143 --> 06:34.943
Off the horse!

06:40.048 --> 06:40.849
Off the horse!

06:50.218 --> 06:52.150
Abbot, save me.

06:52.581 --> 06:53.422
Stinkin' monks!

06:53.822 --> 06:56.925
Commander Hou wants this man's head!
Those who harbour him will share in his crime!

06:57.095 --> 06:59.668
I don't care who you are!
You will not disturb these grounds!

07:55.813 --> 07:56.544
Come then.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.188
Hey! Hey!

08:02.219 --> 08:03.961
Save him and I'll send you
to meet the Buddha.

08:04.061 --> 08:04.962
He's lost a lot of blood.

08:06.333 --> 08:07.464
Quickly, get the haemostatic powder.

08:07.484 --> 08:08.285
Yes, Abbot.

08:10.978 --> 08:12.079
Commander Hou arrives!

08:30.747 --> 08:32.279
These people have welcomed you
with a display of their Shaolin kungfu.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.491
And you reply with guns?
You are without manners.

08:38.225 --> 08:38.765
Commander Hou.

08:58.665 --> 08:59.806
Sir, please don't move.

08:59.836 --> 09:00.907
Abbot, you also don't move.

09:01.838 --> 09:02.839
He's nearing death.

09:03.339 --> 09:05.682
Help him, send him off.

09:06.052 --> 09:07.253
Amitabha.

09:09.425 --> 09:10.687
Buddha sends the fated.

09:11.627 --> 09:14.360
He has arrived,
even if it is on his last breath,

09:15.101 --> 09:16.332
I must still help him.

09:17.703 --> 09:19.575
I ask sir to show compassion.

09:21.617 --> 09:23.849
No more meaningless deaths.

09:25.491 --> 09:27.353
If he doesn't die,
I will not sleep easy.

09:27.623 --> 09:31.097
When the heart is removed from dread,
dreams will no longer be troubled.

09:32.138 --> 09:35.241
With a benevolent heart,
everywhere you go will be the Pure Land.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.642
The Pure Land?

09:38.013 --> 09:40.486
Abbot, you've stayed at Shaolin temple
for far too long, you're confused.

09:42.658 --> 09:44.890
If I don't kill him,
the fighting will continue.

09:46.392 --> 09:47.563
This will mean more killing.

09:48.664 --> 09:49.635
How will we reach the Pure Land then?

09:53.679 --> 09:54.510
Hou Jie.

09:56.151 --> 09:57.182
I admit defeat.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.956
Dengfeng City is already yours.

10:01.857 --> 10:03.158
If you spare me...

10:04.700 --> 10:07.803
I will give all my wealth and money to you.

10:10.000 --> 10:10.681
This...

10:11.586 --> 10:12.745
Is the gold I buried.

10:15.105 --> 10:16.234
Take it.

10:16.591 --> 10:19.162
If you don't kill me, I promise...

10:20.095 --> 10:21.836
I will never return.

10:57.902 --> 10:59.129
Thank you, Abbot.

10:59.442 --> 11:00.613
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

11:02.046 --> 11:03.147
Sir!

11:03.487 --> 11:04.868
Sir!

11:13.395 --> 11:14.592
Defend the temple!

11:17.081 --> 11:19.713
Jingneng, Jingkong, stand down.

11:36.910 --> 11:39.983
A joyous arrival to a sad departure...

11:41.295 --> 11:43.797
The void in our world is once again felt.

11:44.898 --> 11:47.300
Would it not have been better
to have not come and gone...

11:47.941 --> 11:51.174
To be free from happiness and sadness?

11:51.645 --> 11:53.447
Amitabha.

11:55.779 --> 11:56.580
Go.

12:04.862 --> 12:09.080
[ PLAQUE: The Source of All Martial Arts ]
[ GRAFFITI : Empty words. ]

13:00.082 --> 13:02.554
Big brother,
we are meeting with the foreigners tomorrow.

13:03.585 --> 13:04.456
What for?

13:05.087 --> 13:08.030
With proper funding,
we can buy many machine guns and cannons.

13:08.961 --> 13:10.202
With it, we can take Zhengzhou.

13:11.303 --> 13:13.535
More guns is good, but useless if you dont fire them.

13:15.978 --> 13:18.550
Tell me, back at Shaolin, why didn't you fire?

13:22.154 --> 13:22.824
Compassion?

13:24.826 --> 13:28.070
Remember this, when you gain the upper hand...

13:28.140 --> 13:31.373
And you hesitate a moment too long...

13:32.344 --> 13:33.515
The one dead will be you.

13:33.955 --> 13:34.756
Next time...

13:35.787 --> 13:37.949
The next time I come across someone
standing in Brother's way...

13:38.720 --> 13:40.021
I will definitely kill him.

13:42.514 --> 13:43.315
Then you've learned.

13:47.038 --> 13:48.039
Song Hu has already arrived.

13:48.910 --> 13:50.582
That's "Commander Song".

13:52.413 --> 13:52.654
Commander Song.

13:53.825 --> 13:56.427
The bastard, we fight without
seeing any of his men.

13:56.828 --> 13:58.930
But come time to divide the spoils,
he's here ever so quickly.

14:06.908 --> 14:10.351
Brother Hu, Dengfeng City has been taken.

14:10.952 --> 14:11.953
Huo Long is dead.

14:12.854 --> 14:15.826
For a nobody such as Huo Long...

14:16.067 --> 14:17.468
Why such a commotion?

14:18.199 --> 14:19.700
I would think you were still
seeing the coffin off.

14:22.573 --> 14:24.215
We are in rememberance of the
hundreds of brothers lost.

14:25.216 --> 14:26.117
Is that so?

14:27.118 --> 14:28.689
I am in your debt then.

14:29.720 --> 14:32.733
Against Huo Long,
I didn't come, not to take advantage of you...

14:32.993 --> 14:35.406
If it weren't for these two bum legs...

14:35.466 --> 14:37.738
My horse and gun alone would
have been enough to sort him out.

14:39.009 --> 14:40.210
Isn't that right, brother?

14:40.441 --> 14:41.111
Of course...

14:42.853 --> 14:46.156
What is a little loss on my part?
I do not fret.

14:46.527 --> 14:50.260
I know that.
You fret because of DengFeng City.

14:59.449 --> 15:01.051
Sister-in-law, it's been too long.

15:01.892 --> 15:02.622
Big brother.

15:02.693 --> 15:04.755
Shengnan, my darling girl.

15:05.465 --> 15:06.426
Greet your Uncle Song.

15:06.526 --> 15:07.768
Hello, Uncle Song.

15:07.838 --> 15:08.939
Hello, Nan-Nan.

15:10.200 --> 15:13.773
Sister, your Nan-nan is
growing up to be very polite.

15:14.214 --> 15:15.315
More beautiful with age.

15:15.585 --> 15:18.088
With a daughter like her,
be careful someone doesn't steal her away.

15:19.719 --> 15:21.321
It's decided,
this child will be one of the family.

15:23.063 --> 15:23.863
My future daughter-in-law.

15:25.865 --> 15:27.107
When was this arranged?

15:27.507 --> 15:29.739
It doesn't matter, now is all the same.

15:30.510 --> 15:31.781
What? You disagree?

15:33.453 --> 15:35.124
If you disagree then let's fight.

16:15.164 --> 16:15.834
Good.

16:17.436 --> 16:18.407
Good gun.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.779
This is a fully automatic weapon.

16:21.350 --> 16:23.512
You can't buy it anywhere else.

16:24.653 --> 16:25.624
We want eighty units.

16:27.226 --> 16:28.026
How shall we do this?

16:29.658 --> 16:32.271
I wonâ€™t take a penny if...

16:35.544 --> 16:39.147
General Hou supports our railway into Dengfeng.

16:51.069 --> 16:52.971
What did you say?
I didn't hear properly.

16:54.843 --> 16:57.986
I said, I won't take a penny...

16:58.586 --> 17:01.830
If you support the building of our railway.

17:02.861 --> 17:03.962
I don't want the guns anymore.

17:04.963 --> 17:05.532
General.

17:05.763 --> 17:07.005
I don't want the guns anymore!

17:14.622 --> 17:17.986
Go, we head to the city's east.

17:19.396 --> 17:24.402
I believe, General Song Hu
will show more interest.

17:26.404 --> 17:28.146
Mr Peter, please wait.

17:30.918 --> 17:34.151
Brother, this gun is truly marvellous.

17:35.463 --> 17:36.664
If Song Hu takes them...

17:42.440 --> 17:43.270
Show them out!

17:43.471 --> 17:44.672
Yes!

17:44.712 --> 17:45.513
Please.

17:51.559 --> 17:53.460
Next time, choose your words carefully
when you speak to me.

17:54.501 --> 17:56.221
I don't take orders from you.

17:57.474 --> 17:58.936
Maybe when you're in my position, then we'll talk.

18:00.848 --> 18:01.809
You hear what I'm saying?

18:04.381 --> 18:05.722
Am I being clear enough?

18:26.623 --> 18:29.536
To use the lives of our countrymen
and take the wealth of the people.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.041
Agreeing to build their railway...

18:37.283 --> 18:41.518
Is like opening the doors for them to take our land.

18:43.830 --> 18:45.902
The land of the Chinese
belongs to the people of China.

18:46.663 --> 18:48.064
The foreigners' hands reach to take it...

18:49.806 --> 18:51.307
I will chop them all off.

18:54.450 --> 18:56.052
I hope Song Hu feels the same.

18:59.595 --> 19:01.557
I don't think you've listened to what I've said.

19:03.599 --> 19:06.342
These twenty years, I've called him brother.

19:08.114 --> 19:09.215
Do not badmouth him.

19:17.163 --> 19:19.265
And even if he is bad,
it is not for you to say!

19:46.341 --> 19:47.072
I'm dizzy.

19:51.156 --> 19:52.017
What the hell are you doing?

19:52.417 --> 19:53.218
Eating biscuits.

19:53.428 --> 19:54.229
Biscuits?

19:56.361 --> 19:57.492
I'm eating noodles now.

20:00.165 --> 20:01.136
You've gone mad from hunger.

20:02.277 --> 20:04.739
What do you know?
This is called having an idea.

20:05.881 --> 20:07.752
Idea? Having an idea?
All you know is having ideas.

20:08.153 --> 20:10.425
You might be able to do that,
But how about the people out there?

20:10.825 --> 20:11.626
What can they do?

20:13.398 --> 20:16.431
In times of famine, Judge Bao
would feed the people with his own stores.

20:17.072 --> 20:19.144
What if we became masked avengers?

20:19.544 --> 20:21.576
We'll hit back at the warlords' armies.

20:23.678 --> 20:25.790
Brother,
why don't we become masked avengers?

20:27.322 --> 20:28.152
Masked avengers?

20:30.425 --> 20:32.597
That's right,
we'll become avengers that save people.

20:33.197 --> 20:34.999
Brother, that's against the rules.

20:35.340 --> 20:36.341
What are you afraid of?

20:36.441 --> 20:38.443
When the sky falls,
Second Brother will hold it up.

20:39.083 --> 20:40.945
Brother is most generous, am I right?

20:42.757 --> 20:43.618
Of course.

20:43.718 --> 20:45.119
Of course! Of course!

20:48.603 --> 20:50.334
Little Miss, please don't run.

20:53.587 --> 20:54.789
- Quickly get up
- Shengnan!

20:56.610 --> 20:57.611
Are you injured?

20:58.753 --> 21:00.524
What the hell are you doing?
Did I not tell you to hold her hand!?

21:00.594 --> 21:01.695
- I'm sorry.
- Why didn't you watch her!?

21:01.896 --> 21:02.797
- I'm sorry, Master.
- You want to die!?

21:02.997 --> 21:04.198
- I'm sorry.
- Papa.

21:04.899 --> 21:07.501
It doesn't hurt anymore,
please don't be angry with her.

21:09.403 --> 21:11.875
I'm sorry, Master. I'm sorry.

21:12.076 --> 21:13.177
Leave us.

21:15.379 --> 21:16.580
- Does it hurt?
- How does it feel?

21:16.690 --> 21:17.691
I'm not hurt

21:17.791 --> 21:18.692
Are there any injuries?

21:18.892 --> 21:20.094
- Let Papa see.
- Papa.

21:20.524 --> 21:21.795
I made a drawing for you.

21:25.719 --> 21:26.920
[My daddy likes fighting]

21:32.025 --> 21:32.626
Is this Papa?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.191
Here, Papa will carry you.

21:38.231 --> 21:39.733
Hold on.

21:39.803 --> 21:40.834
Is Papa this mean?

21:42.375 --> 21:42.906
Big brother.

21:46.980 --> 21:49.082
Hold it for now, give it to me later.

22:01.514 --> 22:04.117
Ive personally delivered the
marriage contract to Commander Song.

22:05.618 --> 22:06.649
He was very happy.

22:08.391 --> 22:10.293
Tomorrow night, Zhongyue Restaurant.

22:11.264 --> 22:13.796
Commander Song and wife, their son.

22:14.937 --> 22:16.009
Eating begins on the dot.

22:30.833 --> 22:32.204
I want to ask you a question.

22:36.609 --> 22:40.683
Since Song Hu already knows
that I have Huo Long's gold...

22:40.753 --> 22:41.854
Why does he not ask me about it?

22:47.600 --> 22:48.731
He wants it all.

22:50.873 --> 22:52.214
Including DengFeng City.

22:58.490 --> 23:01.463
The one who strikes first wins.

23:03.295 --> 23:05.267
Then this is a good opportunity.

23:08.810 --> 23:09.381
Correct.

23:10.812 --> 23:14.616
Pick thirty of your finest and
make preparations at the Zhongyue Restaurant.

23:27.048 --> 23:29.651
If he's not dead, I can't sleep.

23:35.867 --> 23:36.828
Big brother is wise.

23:48.960 --> 23:50.061
You want to kill Brother Song?

23:56.137 --> 23:57.739
It would be better if you didn't know.

24:00.641 --> 24:02.013
Be he is your brother.

24:03.654 --> 24:04.485
Please think again.

24:07.929 --> 24:09.260
Song Hu wants to take me down.

24:13.174 --> 24:14.275
Do you have any other solution?

24:15.506 --> 24:17.108
Spit it out now, it's not too late.

24:18.179 --> 24:20.781
Don't ask me, I don't know.

24:25.165 --> 24:26.297
I only have just one request...

24:30.170 --> 24:31.642
Don't let your daughter see it.

24:33.574 --> 24:34.314
Okay?

25:19.939 --> 25:20.870
A mouse?

25:22.772 --> 25:25.415
Brother, once we've stolen the rice,
how about noodles next?

25:27.417 --> 25:30.259
Could you not call it "stealing"?
We are "taking".

25:31.531 --> 25:32.792
Then how much are we "taking"?

25:33.593 --> 25:35.465
A bag we'll take,
two bags we'll also take.

25:36.105 --> 25:37.336
Take however much we can.

25:37.437 --> 25:38.437
Jinghai.

25:38.978 --> 25:41.581
As masked avengers, we should leave a calling card.

25:41.811 --> 25:42.782
What should we use?

25:44.353 --> 25:45.414
How about your shiny head?

25:45.615 --> 25:46.415
You!

26:06.295 --> 26:07.096
Rice.

26:08.237 --> 26:09.838
Son, we have rice.

26:12.541 --> 26:13.772
Brother, its rice!

26:15.184 --> 26:17.015
The gods have opened their eyes.

26:17.546 --> 26:19.057
Thank you! Thank you!

26:20.719 --> 26:21.490
There's rice!

27:17.165 --> 27:18.606
Wait until I knock on the table...

27:19.737 --> 27:21.639
You take our daughter to the toilets.

27:22.179 --> 27:25.613
Papa, we are here to eat.
Why do we need to go to the toilets?

27:26.253 --> 27:27.284
Listen to Papa now...

27:27.355 --> 27:28.786
And Papa will listen to you one day.
Don't argue.

27:45.192 --> 27:45.623
Please.

27:46.794 --> 27:47.865
This way.

28:10.517 --> 28:11.318
Big Brother.

28:12.319 --> 28:13.120
Sister.

28:13.350 --> 28:15.822
Brother, you're late again.

28:16.183 --> 28:17.083
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

28:17.284 --> 28:18.084
Say hello.

28:18.094 --> 28:20.096
Hello, Uncle Song.
Hello, Auntie.

28:20.197 --> 28:22.229
Wanshan, greet Uncle and Auntie.

28:22.829 --> 28:23.570
Uncle.

28:23.970 --> 28:24.771
Auntie.

28:25.432 --> 28:26.232
Well behaved.

28:27.434 --> 28:28.234
Really well behaved.

28:30.276 --> 28:31.117
Sirs.

28:33.790 --> 28:35.522
The Song family's Young Master
was born in the year of the rabbit.

28:35.622 --> 28:37.093
The Hou family's Little Miss
was born in the year of the sheep.

28:37.163 --> 28:38.595
A great match.

28:38.795 --> 28:42.869
Moreover, their dates of birth
are very auspicious.

28:43.139 --> 28:46.112
Their five elements complimenting,
fortunes will equally flourish.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.784
A match made in heaven.

28:47.884 --> 28:52.288
I dare say, this match will bring
wealth and fortune to both families.

28:52.528 --> 28:54.931
Together till their hair turns grey.

28:55.031 --> 28:57.403
Thereafter, a hundred children and
a thousand grandchildren.

28:58.404 --> 28:59.405
Great, great.

29:00.306 --> 29:04.650
Actually, as Buddhists we talk about
fate being the cause of all things.

29:04.920 --> 29:06.722
Without fate, things do not converge.

29:07.283 --> 29:09.525
With fate, I believe...

29:09.595 --> 29:11.527
They would have come together sooner or later.

29:11.727 --> 29:12.828
So what are we waiting for?

29:13.068 --> 29:14.670
Quick, quick, quick!
On with the wedding invitations!

29:15.871 --> 29:16.842
What are you so anxious about?

29:17.072 --> 29:18.043
How can I not be?

29:19.215 --> 29:21.447
If I were to lose such a
wonderful daughter-in-law...

29:21.487 --> 29:22.988
Where would I find another one?

29:23.889 --> 29:26.362
Sirs, please exchange invitations.

29:26.692 --> 29:28.864
This betrothal is finalised.

29:30.736 --> 29:31.467
Agreed!

29:31.667 --> 29:32.367
Here.

29:33.268 --> 29:34.470
Congratulations! Congratulations!

29:35.841 --> 29:37.713
Big brother,
I'll go settle the marriage rites.

29:59.024 --> 30:02.297
Brother, now that we are one family...

30:03.969 --> 30:06.301
I can speak my mind.

30:07.532 --> 30:08.733
Speak.

30:10.815 --> 30:12.787
How are we going to split Dengfeng City...

30:14.319 --> 30:16.821
Between the two of us?

30:17.922 --> 30:18.963
You tell me.

30:28.853 --> 30:30.985
Didn't we already settle this?
One man, one half.

30:33.728 --> 30:35.189
It's all yours.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.374
From today on, Dengfeng City
is not split between you and me.

30:41.105 --> 30:42.847
Only one person will have all the say.

30:43.407 --> 30:45.379
This is the most peaceful solution.

30:49.153 --> 30:50.995
What do you mean by this?

30:51.665 --> 30:54.528
Brother, I am getting old.

30:54.939 --> 30:56.240
I can't fight any more.

30:57.401 --> 30:59.443
Look at this leg, acting up again.

31:00.274 --> 31:02.046
It's time for me to retire.

31:03.787 --> 31:06.060
What's more, we're family now.

31:07.021 --> 31:08.892
Even if I give it to you today...

31:09.293 --> 31:12.466
In the future, will it not be left to my son?

31:13.167 --> 31:16.940
I've thought it through, I don't lose out.

31:18.212 --> 31:21.555
I've held this wine for many years
but could never bring myself to open it.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.627
But today I will.
Here, drink!

31:24.328 --> 31:26.099
Drink up and this matter is settled.

31:30.504 --> 31:31.805
Commander, we've received a secret message.

31:52.385 --> 31:54.988
Son, do you need to go pee?

31:56.019 --> 31:56.789
No need.

31:57.060 --> 32:00.193
Listen to me, ask your mother
to take you to the toilets.

32:01.904 --> 32:04.167
Sister, take Shengnan as well.

32:07.780 --> 32:08.541
Let's go.

32:15.057 --> 32:15.788
Run.

32:24.667 --> 32:25.868
- Vice Wang.
- Here!

32:25.978 --> 32:27.049
Leave us.

32:27.249 --> 32:28.050
Yes.

32:53.795 --> 32:57.605
[ NOTE: General, be careful. ]
[ Hou Jie has an ambush ]

33:02.843 --> 33:03.655
You!

33:04.026 --> 33:05.387
You bastard!

33:07.399 --> 33:09.401
I've always treated you as my own brother.

33:10.031 --> 33:11.503
We conquered the world together.

33:11.573 --> 33:13.505
I would never have thought,
today you wanted to kill me.

33:13.705 --> 33:14.906
- Is this true!?
- Enough!

33:41.132 --> 33:41.963
Shengnan!

33:42.603 --> 33:43.464
Mama!

33:45.977 --> 33:47.378
Mama come quickly!

34:10.150 --> 34:11.051
Go already.

34:36.877 --> 34:38.338
Mama, save me!

34:45.625 --> 34:46.857
Mama.

34:57.377 --> 34:58.918
Mama! Mama.

34:59.789 --> 35:00.690
Mama.

35:01.321 --> 35:03.893
Shengnan!
Get out of here, Shengnan!

35:04.094 --> 35:05.295
- Mama.
- Run quickly!

35:06.196 --> 35:08.298
Shengnan! Run quickly!

35:10.069 --> 35:12.572
Run away, Shengnan! Don't look back!

35:43.602 --> 35:44.503
Shengnan...

36:45.263 --> 36:45.964
General!

36:51.169 --> 36:53.241
Papa! Papa!

36:53.942 --> 36:54.512
Shengnan!

36:56.284 --> 36:57.255
Stop!

37:06.319 --> 37:07.595
Commander! Run!

37:07.910 --> 37:08.814
Run!

37:19.827 --> 37:20.828
Shengnan!

37:39.915 --> 37:40.876
- Shengnan.
- Papa.

37:42.593 --> 37:43.693
Over there!

38:55.401 --> 38:56.586
Kill!

39:00.433 --> 39:01.381
Shengnan, don't be afraid!

39:54.163 --> 39:56.291
Papa... Papa...

40:02.305 --> 40:03.762
Papa...

40:05.733 --> 40:07.265
Shengnan!

42:23.986 --> 42:25.187
Abbot!

42:25.958 --> 42:27.229
Sir! Sir!

42:28.100 --> 42:28.931
Please slow down!

42:29.772 --> 42:32.074
Save her!
Abbot! Save her!

42:32.705 --> 42:33.706
Save her.

42:36.218 --> 42:37.719
Save her! Save her!

42:37.780 --> 42:38.580
Quick! Save her!

42:39.221 --> 42:40.722
Make way! Quickly!

42:45.297 --> 42:46.628
Silver needles! Guanyin paste! Hot water!

42:46.828 --> 42:47.669
Yes!

42:47.669 --> 42:48.470
Hurry!

42:55.887 --> 42:58.420
Shengnan, it'll be alright, it'll be alright.

42:59.561 --> 43:01.133
Shengnan, don't fall asleep.
Wake up.

43:01.463 --> 43:02.294
Madam!

43:03.905 --> 43:07.008
Madam! You are not yet healed! You mustn't run!

43:07.279 --> 43:08.009
Please be careful.

43:10.181 --> 43:11.012
Shengnan

43:12.183 --> 43:13.525
Shengnan, be good.

43:36.968 --> 43:37.839
Shengnan.

43:39.841 --> 43:42.513
Say something to Papa,
Say something to Papa.

43:42.844 --> 43:45.846
Shengnan, say something to Papa.

43:46.117 --> 43:47.618
Shengnan, say something.

43:51.292 --> 43:53.534
Why did you stop? You can't stop!

43:54.105 --> 43:55.236
Hurry up and save her!

43:56.006 --> 43:57.108
Do you want me to beg?

43:58.639 --> 44:01.552
Then I'll beg!
Save her! Save her!

44:04.255 --> 44:04.585
Papa...

44:05.055 --> 44:07.628
Papa, don't scold them.

44:07.898 --> 44:10.631
And don't be angry with them.

44:11.031 --> 44:11.772
Papa will listen.

44:12.202 --> 44:13.774
Papa will listen! Papa will listen!

44:14.675 --> 44:15.546
I beg of you.

44:15.576 --> 44:16.276
Shengnan!

44:16.477 --> 44:17.127
- I beg of you.
- Shengnan.

44:17.217 --> 44:18.318
Mama...

44:19.049 --> 44:20.150
Shengnan!

44:20.220 --> 44:21.291
She's going to be okay.

44:21.492 --> 44:24.995
- Mama, I missed you.
- She's alright!

44:25.495 --> 44:31.611
Mama, let's go home together.

44:32.442 --> 44:33.984
Shengnan, wake up.

44:34.084 --> 44:35.585
Save her.

44:36.716 --> 44:37.687
I'm begging all of you.

44:39.389 --> 44:40.861
Only you can save her.

44:42.032 --> 44:43.193
Shengnan, wake up.

44:43.733 --> 44:45.635
Say something to Mama, Shengnan.

44:45.906 --> 44:46.836
Shengnan.

44:47.237 --> 44:48.008
Shengnan!

44:50.310 --> 44:53.683
Shengnan!

44:56.256 --> 44:57.897
She's alright.

45:00.270 --> 45:01.871
Say something to Papa, say something to Papa.

45:02.071 --> 45:02.932
- She's fine.
- Shengnan!

45:02.942 --> 45:04.274
She can't be dead.

45:05.645 --> 45:08.047
Shengnan! Shengnan!

45:10.450 --> 45:12.552
Please wake up, you can't die.

45:13.092 --> 45:14.263
Shengnan can't die.

45:14.323 --> 45:16.896
Mama is here, look at Mama.

45:16.966 --> 45:19.438
Jinghai, receive the body.

45:19.939 --> 45:21.140
- Yes.
- She can't be dead!

45:21.711 --> 45:24.283
I beg you! Save her!

45:24.343 --> 45:25.214
I beg you.

45:26.856 --> 45:29.088
I beg you. Save her.

45:31.961 --> 45:35.004
Quickly save her.
Abbot have compassion, save her!

45:37.736 --> 45:39.808
If you can't save her, I'll tell you now!

45:41.250 --> 45:42.481
Don't none of you ever think of living!

45:43.882 --> 45:45.824
I will burn Shaolin temple to the ground!

45:46.025 --> 45:47.226
- Abbot, save her!
- Enough!

45:48.657 --> 45:49.758
Amitabha.

45:50.099 --> 45:52.271
Have the gods not yet punished you enough!?

45:53.772 --> 45:54.773
It's your fault!

45:55.744 --> 45:56.645
She's not dead!

45:57.276 --> 45:58.517
I am full of regret!

45:59.288 --> 46:00.919
She is not dead.

46:01.119 --> 46:02.321
- If it wasn't for you...
- She is fine.

46:02.451 --> 46:04.363
How can my daughter be dead!?

46:04.423 --> 46:05.264
She's not dead.

46:05.294 --> 46:07.436
Look! She's dead!

46:07.536 --> 46:08.367
She's not dead.

46:08.567 --> 46:09.768
- She can't see anything anymore!
- She's not dead!

46:09.868 --> 46:11.370
She's not dead, you understand!?

46:11.440 --> 46:12.541
The one who should be dead is you!

46:17.816 --> 46:19.057
Shengnan.

46:23.231 --> 46:25.403
Mama is sorry.

46:26.474 --> 46:27.706
She can't be dead.

46:29.077 --> 46:29.838
She's not dead.

46:31.449 --> 46:31.850
Save her!

46:32.480 --> 46:35.353
You speak of compassion!
How could you just watch her die!?

46:36.124 --> 46:37.595
Fine! Don't save her!

46:38.496 --> 46:40.869
I will kill each and every last one of you.

46:41.699 --> 46:43.101
I'll start with this damned old man.

46:48.116 --> 46:49.317
- Sir!
- I'll kill you all!

46:49.487 --> 46:52.120
I'll kill you all!

46:52.890 --> 46:53.961
Sir!

46:55.723 --> 46:56.194
Kill you all!

46:58.536 --> 46:59.267
Sir!

47:00.037 --> 47:00.908
Restrain him!

47:14.762 --> 47:16.003
I'll kill you all!

47:26.854 --> 47:28.425
I'm going to kill you all...

48:59.875 --> 49:02.348
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:02.748 --> 49:05.651
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:05.721 --> 49:08.524
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:09.765 --> 49:11.797
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:12.428 --> 49:14.900
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:16.672 --> 49:17.873
Leave Shaolin...

49:20.786 --> 49:21.747
This one doesn't count.

49:23.318 --> 49:26.061
Leave Shaolin, stay at Shaolin...

49:26.431 --> 49:27.332
Leave Shaolin...

49:28.794 --> 49:30.395
Is anyone there!?

49:41.326 --> 49:43.258
I set a trap for pigs, how come a man is here?

49:43.798 --> 49:45.030
What are you up to, covered in blood?

49:47.902 --> 49:50.275
I know you, you are that Hou Jie.

49:50.345 --> 49:51.406
You still want to kill people?

49:52.547 --> 49:54.649
When a man is without common sense
is when they are worse than pigs.

49:55.220 --> 49:57.992
Given you're in this situation, best lie still.

49:58.553 --> 49:59.324
Don't howl.

49:59.924 --> 50:02.066
Relax a bit,  I'll be back later.

50:05.199 --> 50:06.300
Amitabha.

50:52.996 --> 50:54.067
Hey, something to eat.

50:55.168 --> 50:56.169
Careful, it's hot.

50:58.812 --> 51:00.274
Cool on the outside, hot on the inside.

51:14.508 --> 51:15.979
Why has it come to this?

51:17.711 --> 51:18.481
Why?

51:31.875 --> 51:33.506
Your wife has left Shaolin.

51:33.776 --> 51:35.748
Your daughter's funeral has been left to you.

52:02.304 --> 52:03.806
Will it be a burial or cremation?

52:07.950 --> 52:09.311
The Abbot asked me to ask you.

52:10.322 --> 52:14.226
With burials, you can see them on holidays.

52:15.698 --> 52:17.329
But who can really see them?

52:17.870 --> 52:19.571
I guess you can dig them out but that's not easy either.

52:20.472 --> 52:22.945
I think cremation is more convenient.

52:24.216 --> 52:27.079
You can see them anytime and take them with you if you move.

52:27.519 --> 52:28.720
To where ever you go.

52:29.621 --> 52:32.264
I think cremation is better.
What do you think?

52:41.913 --> 52:44.186
If its cremation...

52:44.516 --> 52:46.758
Then after you've finished your noodles,
we'll go light the fire.

53:09.070 --> 53:10.532
Take all this and burn it!

53:23.234 --> 53:24.365
So you'd rather die than submit?

53:25.096 --> 53:28.739
At least I'll see Brother in the afterlife.

53:30.011 --> 53:30.842
Fire!

53:32.884 --> 53:34.255
When you were being hunted...

53:35.256 --> 53:36.587
It was Big Brother who saved you.

53:38.029 --> 53:39.260
Who would have thought...

53:40.361 --> 53:42.733
You'd repay his kindness with hatred!

53:44.375 --> 53:45.106
What is kindness?

53:49.650 --> 53:52.523
He didn't save me, he used me.

53:54.154 --> 53:56.757
I've known that for a long time now,
he needed me.

53:58.299 --> 54:00.531
In battle, it was I that killed the most people.

54:01.802 --> 54:04.044
Was there a bit of land I didn't help him conquer?

54:05.345 --> 54:06.647
Then why did I betray Hou Jie?

54:09.319 --> 54:10.320
Answer correctly and I will spare you.

54:12.062 --> 54:13.163
Because...

54:14.835 --> 54:16.436
You are a dog!

54:23.153 --> 54:23.683
Wrong answer.

54:32.863 --> 54:35.875
I betrayed him, because he was afraid.

54:37.747 --> 54:40.350
With fear, comes defeat.

54:41.481 --> 54:42.982
He deserved this.

54:44.894 --> 54:46.526
Now begins my reign.

54:47.627 --> 54:48.728
You understand?

55:15.084 --> 55:18.788
The streets are filled with them,
everywhere with wanted posters.

55:20.700 --> 55:22.962
Actually, it's the same whoever captures you.

55:23.702 --> 55:25.174
Anyway, I've to make rice for you again.

55:25.905 --> 55:29.814
Otherwise, I'll have made fifty thousand silvers now.

55:30.077 --> 55:31.371
[ WANTED: Hou Jie ]
[ REWARD: Ten thousand silvers ]

55:31.820 --> 55:33.953
Eh? It's now a hundred thousand.

55:36.996 --> 55:37.966
Just kidding.

55:38.497 --> 55:40.839
Shaolin temple preaches compassion,
I wouldn't do that to you.

55:43.612 --> 55:44.513
So what now?

55:47.886 --> 55:48.847
I don't want to leave.

55:50.018 --> 55:52.761
You can't treat this place as your home.

56:20.678 --> 56:21.479
What's this?

56:22.851 --> 56:23.822
Throwing a tantrum?

56:24.452 --> 56:25.693
Made up your mind?

57:24.625 --> 57:25.856
Want some help?

57:29.711 --> 57:30.778
- Brother.
- Brother.

57:37.044 --> 57:38.645
There is suddenly a lot more rice in the kitchens.

57:40.016 --> 57:40.817
How did this happen?

57:42.189 --> 57:43.660
A lot more rice?

57:47.534 --> 57:49.536
Oh! Our prayers have been answered!

57:51.578 --> 57:53.540
Amitabha, amitabha, amitabha.

57:55.852 --> 57:57.354
Then you better ask Buddha...

57:58.184 --> 58:01.227
Why there are shadow men jumping
about on the rooftops at night?

58:01.998 --> 58:02.729
Shadow men?

58:04.731 --> 58:06.472
How can there be shadow men
at the temple?

58:07.073 --> 58:08.474
They came to steal the rice.

58:09.646 --> 58:11.578
It's to steal the rice back here,
not steal the rice.

58:19.165 --> 58:21.768
All involved present to the training grounds
after morning lessons for your punishment!

58:22.238 --> 58:23.499
Yes, Elder Brother.

58:38.034 --> 58:38.804
You again!

58:41.707 --> 58:42.508
What the hell do you want?

58:43.549 --> 58:45.080
Amitabha.

58:45.211 --> 58:46.682
Master.

58:51.327 --> 58:53.959
Abbot, I want to stay at Shaolin.

58:54.570 --> 58:55.471
That's not for you to decide.

58:55.971 --> 58:57.072
You are now wanted.

58:57.172 --> 58:59.344
Isn't so you can avoid capture?

59:02.317 --> 59:03.479
I've decided to become a monk.

59:04.249 --> 59:07.352
Shaolin will not become your battlefield,
The decision is not yours to make.

59:08.994 --> 59:10.365
Return to whence you came.

59:11.136 --> 59:14.710
Did the Abbot not say once,
"Buddha sends the fated"?

59:15.370 --> 59:16.712
Who says you are fated?

59:17.983 --> 59:18.744
Master.

59:21.356 --> 59:24.389
You'll only receive his body,
you won't receive his heart.

59:25.290 --> 59:27.732
His sins are great.
He is a warlord, Master.

59:28.003 --> 59:30.135
Master, a person like him will
sully the name of Shaolin Temple.

59:32.407 --> 59:34.239
There is the essence of Buddha in all.

59:36.051 --> 59:38.383
We should not discriminate.

59:40.255 --> 59:42.397
Everything is empty,
only fate is with substance.

59:43.728 --> 59:46.971
His heart is full of hatred and revenge,
it will not receive the enlightenment.

59:48.373 --> 59:49.404
Well said.

59:50.074 --> 59:54.078
But we cannot deny the teachings
of Buddha by closing the way.

59:55.149 --> 59:56.421
Nor can we, if we tried.

59:57.422 --> 01:00:00.795
Troublesome is the Bodhi,
since understanding is confusing.

01:00:01.736 --> 01:00:04.609
The old ways are dying.

01:00:05.109 --> 01:00:08.613
I think, we should let him stay for now.

01:00:14.458 --> 01:00:16.761
The Abbot has dumped you on me again?

01:00:17.962 --> 01:00:19.133
But being in Shaolin is alright.

01:00:19.463 --> 01:00:22.636
Out there, it's a dog eat dog world.

01:00:22.676 --> 01:00:23.477
Wait outside.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:27.351
New Baldy, it's cold, wear this.

01:00:27.922 --> 01:00:28.983
Off to work!

01:00:36.110 --> 01:00:37.311
- Amitabha!
- Morning.

01:00:40.639 --> 01:00:44.847
[ Asiatorrents Wan Sui! ]
[ Malvinh Wan Sui! ]

01:00:54.638 --> 01:00:56.540
Make way! Mantous are here!

Line up! Line up!

01:01:09.402 --> 01:01:10.163
Thank you.

01:01:12.275 --> 01:01:13.076
Not so hard, eh?

01:01:15.769 --> 01:01:16.770
Not hard.

01:01:17.450 --> 01:01:19.082
Don't push, don't push.
Plenty, plenty.

01:01:28.942 --> 01:01:30.943
Strike without the fist being seen.
Not the way if it is.

01:01:36.619 --> 01:01:37.120
Practice to the Way.

01:01:39.091 --> 01:01:40.062
Actions are fluid.

01:01:40.633 --> 01:01:41.123
Move with feeling.

01:01:42.735 --> 01:01:43.696
Know the fine.

01:01:44.407 --> 01:01:45.468
Awaken to the Zen.

01:02:53.274 --> 01:02:54.776
Quickly bring the wooden container
to hold the food!

01:02:55.044 --> 01:02:56.076
Okay.

01:03:17.718 --> 01:03:18.759
Hey.

01:03:19.821 --> 01:03:20.822
Have you practised before?

01:03:20.892 --> 01:03:21.692
What?

01:03:21.893 --> 01:03:23.094
- Kungfu
- Kungfu?

01:03:24.535 --> 01:03:28.179
Truth is, when I was younger I trained for two years.

01:03:28.609 --> 01:03:31.352
But like you, my heart was not focused.

01:03:32.683 --> 01:03:33.684
So I worked in the kitchen.

01:03:36.327 --> 01:03:39.360
You want to learn,
learn the Dharma.

01:03:40.201 --> 01:03:41.061
Dharma.

01:03:43.003 --> 01:03:44.235
Faced the wall for nine years.

01:03:44.705 --> 01:03:46.947
What was he refining?
The heart.

01:03:47.217 --> 01:03:49.750
Without conflict, gained wisdom
from every inch of his body.

01:03:50.991 --> 01:03:53.494
The thoughts from his hair
is as the hair on our head.

01:03:54.725 --> 01:03:57.728
This level is called the Zen Wu.

01:05:25.174 --> 01:05:25.945
Let's practise together.

01:05:30.119 --> 01:05:30.849
Fists and heart as one.

01:05:33.552 --> 01:05:34.693
Elbows and knees as one.

01:05:37.566 --> 01:05:38.797
Shoulders and hips as one.

01:05:40.469 --> 01:05:42.040
Heart and mind as one.

01:05:43.009 --> 01:05:44.409
Mind and breath as one.

01:05:45.484 --> 01:05:46.815
Breath and strength as one.

01:05:47.786 --> 01:05:48.957
Practise to the Way.

01:05:50.258 --> 01:05:51.119
Actions are fluid.

01:05:52.330 --> 01:05:53.191
Move with feeling.

01:05:54.963 --> 01:05:55.834
Know the fine.

01:05:57.636 --> 01:05:58.507
Awaken to the Zen.

01:06:02.410 --> 01:06:03.481
Stay strong!

01:06:04.753 --> 01:06:08.096
They're hopping down, we're squatting down.
Both ways build strength.

01:06:08.156 --> 01:06:09.027
Straighten up!

01:06:23.791 --> 01:06:25.063
Hold down this meridian.

01:06:27.465 --> 01:06:28.396
It'll be alright.

01:06:42.189 --> 01:06:43.461
You go now, go.

01:06:45.323 --> 01:06:46.123
For you.

01:07:52.729 --> 01:07:55.602
The weather is cold,
why are you not inside resting?

01:07:55.672 --> 01:07:57.874
Precisely because it is cold,
I am here practising.

01:07:59.015 --> 01:07:59.816
Are you cold?

01:08:01.467 --> 01:08:02.268
A little.

01:08:02.889 --> 01:08:04.120
Then practice with me.

01:08:06.763 --> 01:08:07.593
Okay.

01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:06.581
Abbot, his form is a bit off.

01:09:08.712 --> 01:09:12.127
From the heart it follows,
from thoughts give rise.

01:09:14.529 --> 01:09:15.600
He is fine as he is.

01:09:18.303 --> 01:09:23.148
In practising martial arts,
the vengeance in his heart is released.

01:09:23.808 --> 01:09:25.620
I do not practise martial arts,
this I do not understand.

01:09:27.152 --> 01:09:31.156
Practising martial arts is Zen,
cooking is also Zen.

01:09:31.926 --> 01:09:33.627
The principles are roughly the same.

01:09:35.439 --> 01:09:40.174
Wudao, the most important things in
life are experience and practise.

01:09:41.215 --> 01:09:42.587
I've said it many times.

01:09:43.348 --> 01:09:46.661
Leave Shaolin Temple,
go see the world outside.

01:09:47.220 --> 01:09:48.533
All I know is how to cook.

01:09:48.593 --> 01:09:50.595
Out there, I'm of no use.

01:09:50.795 --> 01:09:51.996
I'm not going.

01:09:52.305 --> 01:09:55.680
A piece of gold and a pile of dirt.

01:09:56.040 --> 01:09:57.241
Which has more use?

01:09:57.852 --> 01:09:59.113
I guess the piece of gold.

01:09:59.213 --> 01:10:00.354
And if I gave you a seed?

01:10:02.626 --> 01:10:04.689
Don't sell yourself short.

01:10:06.130 --> 01:10:09.003
Everyone is useful in their own way.

01:10:43.937 --> 01:10:47.310
Cao Man, you want us to help the foreigners build the railway.

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:51.585
But you mustn't forget,
Mangshan is the resting place of our ancestors.

01:10:52.586 --> 01:10:55.498
Disturb the soil and you break the Feng Shui.

01:10:56.229 --> 01:10:57.961
The ancestors will never agree to this!

01:11:00.744 --> 01:11:03.306
If you are really going to do it, I have nothing to say.

01:11:04.247 --> 01:11:06.980
I'm just worried that the foreigners are playing us...

01:11:07.390 --> 01:11:09.252
And making deals under the table.

01:11:13.366 --> 01:11:17.540
Cao Man, your betrayal of Hou...

01:11:18.641 --> 01:11:19.342
We don't care.

01:11:19.912 --> 01:11:22.845
He previously said,
building the railway is just a cover.

01:11:23.116 --> 01:11:25.158
It's true intent is to take our land.

01:11:25.758 --> 01:11:27.520
Okay, okay, okay.
Say no more.

01:11:28.030 --> 01:11:30.663
Henan Province's interests are not for one man to decide.

01:11:31.904 --> 01:11:35.037
But looking at Cao Man's attitude, it seems
he's already made an agreement with the foreigners.

01:11:35.808 --> 01:11:37.440
There was no intention to hear us out.

01:11:40.252 --> 01:11:41.053
Go.

01:12:10.642 --> 01:12:13.745
Listen well.
Standing in my way...

01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:16.218
Is not in your best interests.

01:12:18.330 --> 01:12:19.931
They are fortunate.

01:12:20.562 --> 01:12:21.463
But their families...

01:12:23.004 --> 01:12:24.166
Will die much more horrible deaths.

01:12:25.437 --> 01:12:27.008
Whether to become my friend or my enemy...

01:12:29.711 --> 01:12:30.952
Is for you to decide.

01:12:36.398 --> 01:12:37.459
Have a think.

01:12:38.229 --> 01:12:40.972
If there is money to be made, noone loses out.

01:12:52.063 --> 01:12:56.497
What do we do now?
He hasn't returned yet.

01:12:59.310 --> 01:13:01.372
Don't cry, Aunt.
Okay?

01:13:04.916 --> 01:13:07.658
Crying won't bring him back any sooner.

01:13:07.929 --> 01:13:08.659
What has happened?

01:13:09.790 --> 01:13:14.035

for over twenty days now.

01:13:14.606 --> 01:13:15.755

01:14:18.428 --> 01:14:19.669
Why did you kill so many people?

01:14:21.071 --> 01:14:22.702
It was...
It was Commander Cao's orders.

01:14:24.304 --> 01:14:25.505
Leave.

01:14:27.247 --> 01:14:28.448
Leave!

01:14:28.688 --> 01:14:30.920
Hou Jie still lives!
Hou Jie still lives!

01:14:43.483 --> 01:14:44.243
Let's go.

01:14:50.389 --> 01:14:51.731
Cao Man lied to us about building the railway.

01:14:52.732 --> 01:14:55.234
Who knew he was really digging for
artifacts for the foreigners.

01:14:56.235 --> 01:14:58.878
Each one we found, we gave to them.

01:15:00.049 --> 01:15:01.781
In exchange for guns and cannons.

01:15:03.022 --> 01:15:05.624
He was worried it might leak it out,
so he had them silenced.

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:21.790
The Cao Villa still holds many of our brothers.

01:15:22.191 --> 01:15:24.323
At the end of tomorrow's work,
they will all be killed.

01:15:29.208 --> 01:15:30.038
I am sorry.

01:15:32.711 --> 01:15:33.582
Go home.

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:35.554
Quick! We're going.

01:16:23.899 --> 01:16:26.911
Daniel! Daniel! Daniel!

01:16:29.827 --> 01:16:30.588
Go have a look.

01:16:33.060 --> 01:16:35.002
How could this be!?

01:17:18.285 --> 01:17:21.528
In life till now, committed terrible crimes...

01:17:22.659 --> 01:17:26.673
All stemming from the greed of man.

01:17:28.475 --> 01:17:30.577
The actions of one...

01:17:32.319 --> 01:17:35.622
Today begs for the Buddha's forgiveness.

01:17:37.053 --> 01:17:39.626
Evil came to trouble the mind...

01:17:39.931 --> 01:17:41.345
Enough!

01:17:44.100 --> 01:17:46.643
Hereon will trouble no more.

01:17:49.586 --> 01:17:50.446
Shengnan!

01:17:51.217 --> 01:17:53.219
Corruption is without value...

01:17:53.990 --> 01:17:55.962
How can my daughter be dead!?

01:17:57.363 --> 01:18:00.506
Purity without excess.

01:18:08.024 --> 01:18:12.398
Forget bygones with one cut,
one cut to sever all.

01:18:14.430 --> 01:18:15.931
Then will you understand all
that is before you.

01:18:17.773 --> 01:18:21.447
From today on,
this rite bestows the Three Jewels.

01:18:22.218 --> 01:18:23.819
The Buddha is realised.

01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.322
The Way is straightened.

01:18:27.423 --> 01:18:29.194
The monk is at peace.

01:18:31.337 --> 01:18:36.712
Hereon, you will be known
by this order as Jingjue.

01:18:37.673 --> 01:18:40.446
Amitabha.

01:18:40.986 --> 01:18:42.958
Amitabha.

01:18:57.370 --> 01:18:58.822
Capture Hou Jie alive!

01:18:59.194 --> 01:19:00.229
Capture Hou Jie alive!

01:19:00.825 --> 01:19:02.412
Capture Hou Jie alive!

01:19:18.129 --> 01:19:19.442
Sir!

01:19:37.472 --> 01:19:39.474
It's Cao Man! I'm going to stop him!

01:19:40.475 --> 01:19:41.345
Get back here!

01:19:42.276 --> 01:19:42.707
Sit down!

01:19:43.748 --> 01:19:44.519
Calm down.

01:19:47.992 --> 01:19:49.023
He's come at a good time.

01:19:51.425 --> 01:19:53.027
Seize the moment, I will take him back.

01:19:54.298 --> 01:19:56.500
After sunset, go to Cao Villa.

01:19:57.471 --> 01:19:58.272
Rescue the people.

01:19:58.412 --> 01:19:59.213
You'll go?

01:20:00.244 --> 01:20:01.315
You are walking to your own death.

01:20:02.216 --> 01:20:03.988
If my life can be exchanged for countless others...

01:20:05.729 --> 01:20:07.131
What is death?

01:20:08.892 --> 01:20:11.235
Jingjue, you must be careful.

01:20:35.789 --> 01:20:36.550
Nobody move!

01:20:57.734 --> 01:20:59.941
- Nobody move!
- Nobody move!

01:21:07.450 --> 01:21:09.452
Amitabha.

01:21:27.550 --> 01:21:29.652
Please Sir, release the meat cleaver.

01:21:30.863 --> 01:21:33.996
Continue committing sins
and suffer disastrous consequences.

01:21:46.158 --> 01:21:47.429
That was for my daughter.

01:21:48.831 --> 01:21:50.102
Amitabha.

01:21:51.033 --> 01:21:52.204
That sure is my Big Brother.

01:21:54.476 --> 01:21:56.338
I knew you wouldn't die that easily.

01:21:58.851 --> 01:22:01.453
Brother, I thought of you terribly.

01:22:01.653 --> 01:22:02.855
Thought of me?

01:22:07.069 --> 01:22:08.570
If I don't die, you can't sleep, right?

01:22:09.371 --> 01:22:10.502
Don't be ridiculous.

01:22:12.003 --> 01:22:12.874
Nothing of the sort.

01:22:17.078 --> 01:22:18.079
Don't pretend.

01:22:19.761 --> 01:22:22.093
You're afraid I will take you down.

01:22:34.285 --> 01:22:36.828
Jingjue's actions are to
give us an opportunity...

01:22:37.088 --> 01:22:38.389
So we can save lives.

01:22:38.429 --> 01:22:39.961
Your impulsiveness will ruin the plan.

01:22:40.131 --> 01:22:41.462
You understand!?

01:22:53.254 --> 01:22:54.225
You once taught me...

01:22:55.396 --> 01:22:59.500
Gain the upper hand and you hesitate a moment too long,
the one dead will be you.

01:23:01.172 --> 01:23:02.003
I remembered.

01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:12.393
Pull back your men, I'll go with you.

01:23:30.961 --> 01:23:31.962
String the Abbot up.

01:23:32.703 --> 01:23:35.706
Do anything rash and I'll send him to the gods.

01:23:35.976 --> 01:23:38.749
No objections, everyone stand down.

01:23:48.969 --> 01:23:49.870
Come then.

01:24:10.310 --> 01:24:13.283
You promised to have these at Zhengzhou before dawn.

01:24:13.553 --> 01:24:14.384
Relax.

01:24:14.454 --> 01:24:17.026
With Cao's troops, noone will dare block our way.

01:24:19.299 --> 01:24:20.029
Remain vigilant.

01:24:22.802 --> 01:24:24.804
Make way! Make way!

01:24:43.072 --> 01:24:44.714
Get down! I'm talking to you!

01:24:47.552 --> 01:24:48.523
Get down!

01:24:49.719 --> 01:24:50.589
Quickly!

01:24:52.731 --> 01:24:53.592
Get in quickly!

01:24:57.736 --> 01:25:00.880
Big brother, isn't this place more beautiful than before?

01:25:03.512 --> 01:25:04.383
You bring me here...

01:25:06.655 --> 01:25:08.387
Wasn't just for me to praise you, was it?

01:25:10.829 --> 01:25:11.900
Of course not.

01:25:12.831 --> 01:25:15.003
I was wrong. Please forgive me.

01:25:16.905 --> 01:25:19.778
I hope that Brother will once again take me in.

01:25:21.179 --> 01:25:24.453
Conquering the world and
achieving great things.

01:25:25.554 --> 01:25:26.525
Brother, look...

01:25:27.966 --> 01:25:29.698
This was all for your sake.

01:25:30.569 --> 01:25:31.540
This throne is yours.

01:25:32.200 --> 01:25:33.472
This imperial robe is also yours.

01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:42.560
Brother.

01:25:45.093 --> 01:25:47.565
Is money and power really that important to you?

01:25:53.251 --> 01:25:54.252
Listen to me.

01:25:55.783 --> 01:25:57.255
Don't become like me.

01:26:02.130 --> 01:26:03.161
Faking compassion?

01:26:06.004 --> 01:26:07.505
I was messing with you...

01:26:09.777 --> 01:26:11.179
To see how you would play along!

01:26:12.650 --> 01:26:14.051
I have a gift for you.

01:26:14.622 --> 01:26:15.793
Bring her out here!

01:26:52.729 --> 01:26:54.331
I found him for you, Sister.

01:26:54.601 --> 01:26:57.975
I spared her, so man and wife can be reunited.

01:27:15.841 --> 01:27:16.697
Get down!

01:27:24.223 --> 01:27:25.370
About face!

01:27:54.941 --> 01:27:56.142
You've suffered.

01:28:01.137 --> 01:28:03.239
I used to think I was powerful.

01:28:04.910 --> 01:28:06.252
I could take care of both of you.

01:28:09.155 --> 01:28:10.756
But instead, I destroyed us.

01:28:32.437 --> 01:28:33.198
Ready guns!

01:28:36.041 --> 01:28:37.272
Don't shoot!

01:28:41.186 --> 01:28:41.887
Raise arms!

01:28:47.532 --> 01:28:48.433
Fire!

01:28:50.505 --> 01:28:51.706
Fire!

01:28:52.707 --> 01:28:54.439
Guards stay! The rest follow me!

01:28:54.499 --> 01:28:55.300
Yes!

01:29:10.405 --> 01:29:12.917
Master, save us! Save us!

01:29:18.663 --> 01:29:20.565
You men! Go see what's happening!

01:29:20.625 --> 01:29:21.426
Yes!

01:29:38.292 --> 01:29:40.835
The artifacts are being stolen!
After them!

01:29:51.956 --> 01:29:53.157
Out of my way!

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:38.151
Hou Jie!

01:30:38.852 --> 01:30:39.653
Let go of her!

01:30:41.925 --> 01:30:42.826
Let go of her!

01:30:43.426 --> 01:30:43.697
Big brother...

01:30:44.557 --> 01:30:45.698
You're crying!

01:30:47.370 --> 01:30:48.171
Let her go!

01:30:48.872 --> 01:30:50.073
Your death alone...

01:30:51.604 --> 01:30:53.046
Won't satisfy me.

01:30:54.717 --> 01:30:56.489
You watched your daughter die...

01:30:56.719 --> 01:30:59.492
Now I want you to watch your wife die.

01:31:00.493 --> 01:31:01.864
Then I can be happy.

01:31:09.212 --> 01:31:10.913
You animal! Let her go!

01:31:10.943 --> 01:31:12.014
Let her go!

01:31:19.932 --> 01:31:22.405
Sister is very pretty.
What a shame...

01:31:23.406 --> 01:31:24.777
You are a monk.

01:31:36.068 --> 01:31:38.130
Cao Man! Stop it!

01:31:45.077 --> 01:31:47.850
Commander!
Shaolin monks have stolen the artifacts!

01:31:48.090 --> 01:31:49.962
Attacked the prison and released the prisoners!

01:32:03.385 --> 01:32:04.986
You deceived me.

01:32:06.678 --> 01:32:07.530
Kill him.

01:32:38.660 --> 01:32:39.691
Jingjue! Go!

01:32:44.435 --> 01:32:45.196
Go quickly.

01:33:21.773 --> 01:33:22.517
Go!

01:33:30.861 --> 01:33:31.892
Eldest brother!

01:33:53.514 --> 01:33:54.644
Go!

01:33:59.949 --> 01:34:00.920
Go!

01:34:01.326 --> 01:34:02.216
Go!

01:34:10.900 --> 01:34:11.941
Eldest brother!

01:34:11.947 --> 01:34:12.688
Go!

01:34:14.444 --> 01:34:15.445
Go!

01:34:16.546 --> 01:34:17.687
Eldest brother!

01:34:27.106 --> 01:34:31.210
Eldest brother! Eldest brother! Eldest brother!

01:34:31.480 --> 01:34:33.212
You won't listen to my orders!?

01:34:35.484 --> 01:34:36.455
Go!

01:34:39.502 --> 01:34:40.907
Go!

01:34:41.260 --> 01:34:42.832
Go! We'll escort the villagers first!

01:36:30.019 --> 01:36:31.057
What do you want?

01:36:31.298 --> 01:36:32.129
Back inside!

01:36:36.273 --> 01:36:37.174
Abbot.

01:36:38.075 --> 01:36:39.246
Get back inside.

01:36:46.599 --> 01:36:47.265
Hey!

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:49.036
Little monk, don't force me.

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:50.697
I warn you to go back inside now.

01:36:51.538 --> 01:36:52.569
I don't want to kill children.

01:37:11.978 --> 01:37:13.950
Sir, please show compassion.

01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:15.582
Let us save the Abbot.

01:37:15.982 --> 01:37:18.324
You will attain wealth and happiness.

01:37:24.771 --> 01:37:26.973
Sir, Abbot always said...

01:37:27.043 --> 01:37:29.145
A brave man is one who knows to return
after having lost his way.

01:37:29.746 --> 01:37:31.618
Put it down and go home.

01:37:32.118 --> 01:37:34.350
I'm sure your family is waiting for you.

01:37:50.316 --> 01:37:51.387
Insolence!

01:37:51.727 --> 01:37:53.329
Want to rebel? Catch them!

01:38:11.367 --> 01:38:12.598
Amitabha.

01:38:20.476 --> 01:38:22.387
I don't want to fight!
I don't know kungfu!

01:38:22.618 --> 01:38:23.649
Amitabha.

01:38:41.056 --> 01:38:42.888
Stop fighting!

01:38:43.028 --> 01:38:44.759
Don't want to fight anymore!

01:38:59.194 --> 01:39:00.325
I'll fight you with my life!

01:39:17.592 --> 01:39:18.463
Abbot!

01:39:19.063 --> 01:39:19.864
Are you hurt?

01:39:28.983 --> 01:39:31.215
Uncle! Toss them like you were frying vegetables!

01:39:49.393 --> 01:39:51.455
Uncle! Beat them like you were kneading dough!

01:40:17.751 --> 01:40:18.982
Uncle! Great!

01:40:19.888 --> 01:40:21.474
- Abbot!
- Abbot!

01:40:21.885 --> 01:40:22.986
Are you alright?

01:40:24.958 --> 01:40:26.129
We must get inside quickly.

01:40:26.343 --> 01:40:27.565
- Okay.
- Go.

01:40:49.172 --> 01:40:50.173
It's them!

01:40:56.438 --> 01:40:57.509
Huzi!

01:41:02.465 --> 01:41:03.566
Mother!

01:41:10.111 --> 01:41:11.206
Father!

01:41:29.752 --> 01:41:32.494
Jingneng's sacrifice was not in vain.

01:41:33.495 --> 01:41:36.839
Don't be too attached.

01:41:55.407 --> 01:41:58.550
Sirs and Madams, please ready and pack your things.

01:42:00.312 --> 01:42:02.684
We are leaving Shaolin Temple.

01:42:19.951 --> 01:42:21.092
I know you are scared.

01:42:23.324 --> 01:42:24.565
But I am not.

01:42:26.137 --> 01:42:28.870
Because my loved ones are gone,
my family is already lost.

01:42:31.512 --> 01:42:32.383
Who wouldn't be scared?

01:42:38.629 --> 01:42:39.630
These few days...

01:42:41.632 --> 01:42:45.136
I felt just like you...

01:42:46.877 --> 01:42:48.409
Shaolin Temple is a happy place.

01:42:50.151 --> 01:42:51.282
It has become our home.

01:42:53.754 --> 01:42:54.925
Shaolin Temple might...

01:42:56.827 --> 01:42:57.998
Meet its end today.

01:43:00.671 --> 01:43:01.942
But the spirit of Shaolin...

01:43:03.544 --> 01:43:04.915
Every flower and blade of grass...

01:43:06.527 --> 01:43:07.728
Its beams and columns,
its bricks and tiles...

01:43:09.089 --> 01:43:11.522
Will forever stay in our hearts.

01:43:12.563 --> 01:43:13.524
The spirit of Shaolin...

01:43:16.096 --> 01:43:19.840
Taught me to persevere and show courage.

01:43:21.385 --> 01:43:22.792
To never abandon hope.

01:43:27.237 --> 01:43:29.337
I ask you all to live your lives as best you can.

01:44:15.705 --> 01:44:16.806
I have a favour to ask of you.

01:44:17.076 --> 01:44:17.947
What?

01:44:21.350 --> 01:44:22.652
You lead them out of here.

01:44:23.492 --> 01:44:23.953
No, no, no.

01:44:24.864 --> 01:44:26.325
I have never left Shaolin Temple.

01:44:26.726 --> 01:44:28.637
No, no, no.
I'm scared.

01:44:30.399 --> 01:44:31.100
You're scared?

01:44:32.011 --> 01:44:33.112
Look at them.

01:44:34.183 --> 01:44:35.014
They need you.

01:44:37.216 --> 01:44:38.417
They are more scared than you.

01:44:42.431 --> 01:44:43.932
I...
Let me think...

01:44:51.308 --> 01:44:52.184
Fine.

01:44:53.952 --> 01:44:54.823
I'll go.

01:45:30.959 --> 01:45:31.930
We must distract them.

01:45:32.160 --> 01:45:34.532
We must escort the villagers up the mountain.

01:45:35.203 --> 01:45:37.135
Jinghai, take the Abbot first.

01:45:37.675 --> 01:45:39.407
Jingkong, you lead.
I'll catch up.

01:45:39.477 --> 01:45:41.139
- Move quickly!
- I'll fight them with my life!

01:45:42.532 --> 01:45:43.300
Quickly!

01:45:44.422 --> 01:45:45.423
Move quickly!

01:47:04.581 --> 01:47:05.582
Go quickly!

01:47:30.056 --> 01:47:33.299
You bastards! Want to destroy Shaolin!?

01:47:33.399 --> 01:47:34.530
I'll destroy you!

01:48:42.117 --> 01:48:44.959
Cao Man, wake up already.

01:48:47.162 --> 01:48:51.466
You must know, you've always had more than you need.

01:48:53.037 --> 01:48:56.611
Put it down, discontinue this path.

01:49:00.154 --> 01:49:03.398
We are in a war, it has always been like this.

01:49:04.399 --> 01:49:05.400
Don't be like me.

01:49:07.842 --> 01:49:09.904
I've come to realise my past crimes.

01:49:14.689 --> 01:49:15.519
It's time to stop.

01:49:16.290 --> 01:49:17.421
Could we not fight?

01:49:18.562 --> 01:49:19.523
What do you think?

01:50:32.335 --> 01:50:33.176
I yield.

01:52:00.241 --> 01:52:01.743
Shaolin Temple?

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.342
Shaolin Temple will not be dishonoured.

01:52:44.765 --> 01:52:48.609
Buddha is compassionate.

01:53:10.681 --> 01:53:12.552
Madam! You can't leave! It's dangerous outside!

01:53:12.593 --> 01:53:14.424
Abbot! My child is missing!

01:53:14.494 --> 01:53:16.266
My child is missing!

01:53:17.397 --> 01:53:18.428
Mama!

01:53:33.913 --> 01:53:34.458
Brother.

01:53:34.459 --> 01:53:35.268
- Brother!
- Brother!

01:53:37.707 --> 01:53:38.538
Quick! Quick!

01:53:38.702 --> 01:53:39.473
Brother...

01:53:41.451 --> 01:53:42.212
Brother!

01:53:50.941 --> 01:53:52.589
- Brother!
- Jinghai...

01:53:53.473 --> 01:53:54.233
Brother!

01:54:00.520 --> 01:54:04.353
Amitabha.

01:54:06.507 --> 01:54:07.817
- Brother!
- Brother!

01:54:08.137 --> 01:54:09.038
Brother!

01:54:09.614 --> 01:54:11.218
- Brother!
- Brother!

01:54:12.371 --> 01:54:14.674
I will stay behind!
You all must deliver the villagers safely!

01:54:14.944 --> 01:54:15.474
Abbot!

01:55:41.979 --> 01:55:44.212
It's time you woke up...

01:56:15.272 --> 01:56:16.313
Hold onto me!

01:56:51.878 --> 01:56:54.351
Amitabha.

01:57:00.867 --> 01:57:01.968
Evil is borne from the heart.

01:57:04.370 --> 01:57:05.642
Repent.

01:58:13.508 --> 01:58:14.609
Why?

02:02:44.759 --> 02:02:45.879
Uncle...

02:02:47.168 --> 02:02:48.174
The temple is gone.

02:02:51.375 --> 02:02:54.582
It's okay.
Shaolin Temple is in our hearts.

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:56.234
It will never be burnt down.

02:03:25.285 --> 02:03:26.533
Life follows fate.

02:03:28.708 --> 02:03:32.810
Fate follows life.
From which we can live at ease.

02:03:35.075 --> 02:03:35.999
Here.

02:03:37.253 --> 02:03:38.836
Hereon, she will keep you company.

02:03:55.136 --> 02:03:56.222
You won't go?

02:04:00.708 --> 02:04:01.979
Cao Man is here.

02:04:04.766 --> 02:04:06.091
His mistakes are also mine.

02:04:07.825 --> 02:04:09.181
Only I can help him.

02:04:14.183 --> 02:04:15.717
You've really changed.

02:04:20.573 --> 02:04:21.611
I know...

02:04:26.020 --> 02:04:28.067
We can't be together again.

02:04:31.853 --> 02:04:32.801
But...

02:04:36.678 --> 02:04:39.494
I am really happy for you.
