00:00.609 --> 00:02.609
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.610 --> 00:05.998
Let's do something fun,
like go to Raging Waters.

00:06.023 --> 00:08.106
- I have a deposition today.
- (groans)

00:08.132 --> 00:09.406
Oh,
Nathan-ay-El.

00:09.446 --> 00:12.527
I'm using the exact tools
that we have all learned here,

00:12.529 --> 00:14.646
in group therapy with my friends,

00:14.648 --> 00:18.066
Lana and Clarice and Bert

00:18.068 --> 00:20.078
and Jo... illson.

00:20.103 --> 00:22.621
Doesn't it feel like you're
repeating some old patterns?

00:22.623 --> 00:24.539
Your patterns with Josh, perhaps?

00:24.541 --> 00:26.158
Are you breaking up with me right now?

00:26.160 --> 00:27.743
I'm just saying that
we can't be together

00:27.745 --> 00:30.462
or go out or have sex.

00:30.464 --> 00:31.830
Rebecca, wait, you can't just...

00:31.832 --> 00:33.465
WHITE JOSH: Who are we kidding, dude?

00:33.467 --> 00:36.301
- We got dumped.
- Yeah.

00:36.303 --> 00:37.669
We did.

00:39.623 --> 00:42.641
- What the hell are you doing?
- Can I have my cash back now?

00:42.643 --> 00:44.059
I already bought a hot tub.

00:44.061 --> 00:46.728
You tried a lot of different
things, and we supported you

00:46.730 --> 00:48.847
every time you wanted to quit something.

00:48.849 --> 00:52.317
I am an aimless cynic who
has no plans for my future.

00:52.319 --> 00:53.518
No, I don't live with my mom.

00:53.520 --> 00:54.751
I live with my best friend.

00:54.776 --> 00:56.488
DARRYL: I'll find someone great

00:56.490 --> 00:57.406
to donate an egg.

00:57.408 --> 00:59.691
I'd do anything for you.
You know that, right?

00:59.693 --> 01:01.076
PAULA: You're donating an egg

01:01.078 --> 01:02.828
- to Darryl?
- I have thought this through.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.024
- Have you, though?
- No, not at all.

01:08.899 --> 01:12.371
HEATHER: So... then I finished my
continuing education archery class,

01:12.373 --> 01:14.593
and now I'm, like, a
champion-level bowman,

01:14.618 --> 01:18.173
but it turns out, the Ren fair
only comes, like, once a year.

01:18.198 --> 01:19.782
Well, continuing ed. That's fun.

01:19.853 --> 01:21.461
Yeah, now you can say
you're a student again.

01:21.486 --> 01:22.985
Yeah, but continuing ed

01:22.987 --> 01:24.337
doesn't really count.

01:25.017 --> 01:27.990
It's like... I don't know,
if I'm not a student anymore,

01:27.992 --> 01:29.563
then it's just, like,

01:29.961 --> 01:31.377
who am I?

01:31.379 --> 01:33.106
- (phone beeps)
- Oh! Hold on.

01:33.131 --> 01:34.296
- Hormone time.
- _

01:34.298 --> 01:36.632
- (moaning, groaning)
- Can you just...

01:36.634 --> 01:38.584
go to the bathroom and do that, please?

01:38.586 --> 01:40.002
If women can breastfeed in public,

01:40.004 --> 01:42.251
then I can inject myself with hormones

01:42.798 --> 01:44.473
at this open-air donuteria.

01:44.475 --> 01:45.470
I'm not ashamed of it.

01:45.495 --> 01:48.978
I am helping my good
friend Darryl make a baby,

01:48.980 --> 01:51.347
and I do not care if
people think it's gross.

01:51.349 --> 01:53.349
I am people, and I think it's gross.

01:53.351 --> 01:55.901
Guys, look at all of
my subcutaneous tissue.

01:55.903 --> 01:58.900
I'm, like, the sub-Q queen.
Thanks, donuts.

01:58.925 --> 02:01.524
Well, now you're actively
ruining donuts for people.

02:01.526 --> 02:03.859
- Ah...
- Oh, my goodness. Ugh...

02:03.861 --> 02:04.944
MAN: Ew!

02:04.946 --> 02:06.362
MAN 2: Take it to the alley, junkie!

02:06.364 --> 02:07.913
I'm making a miracle.

02:08.728 --> 02:09.865
- People.
- HEATHER: Wait.

02:09.866 --> 02:12.084
What did Dr. Shin say
about this whole thing?

02:12.360 --> 02:14.453
- Hmm?
- I don't know, maybe just seems like

02:14.455 --> 02:16.672
someone in therapy for
a personality disorder

02:16.674 --> 02:20.040
may not want to take tons of hormones?

02:21.938 --> 02:23.796
He said it was fine.

02:23.798 --> 02:24.930
- Really?
- Yeah.

02:24.932 --> 02:26.960
As long as I'm present and aware,

02:26.985 --> 02:30.476
and I monitor my mental
state, it's all good.

02:30.501 --> 02:31.854
And if I feel stuff start to come up,

02:31.856 --> 02:34.056
I can just use the acronyms
that I've learned in group.

02:34.058 --> 02:35.618
Like, ooh, there's SASSY.

02:35.643 --> 02:40.863
It's "Separate, Assess,
Step Away, Soothe Yourself."

02:40.865 --> 02:42.064
(Paula gasps)

02:42.066 --> 02:43.353
Oh, that's catchy.

02:43.378 --> 02:45.901
Also, you know how Robert
Downey Jr. kind of went through

02:45.903 --> 02:47.570
that spiral, and he
broke into someone's house

02:47.572 --> 02:48.737
and slept in a child's bed?

02:48.739 --> 02:50.739
But then, he had that
guest star in Ally McBeal,

02:50.741 --> 02:51.957
and now he's Iron Man?

02:51.959 --> 02:52.958
That's me.

02:53.470 --> 02:55.411
Someone translate, please?

02:55.413 --> 02:56.712
Oh, she's going back to work.

02:56.714 --> 02:57.746
That's what I meant.
I'm going back to work!

02:57.748 --> 03:00.466
Wow, you got your job
back from Nathaniel?

03:00.468 --> 03:01.500
I mean, that resignation didn't count.

03:01.502 --> 03:02.635
And he knew that I would feel like

03:02.637 --> 03:04.299
coming back to work at some point.

03:04.324 --> 03:06.839
Yeah, are you sure he
wants to work with you,

03:06.841 --> 03:08.090
since you dumped him?

03:08.092 --> 03:09.558
Oh, no, I didn't dump him.

03:09.856 --> 03:12.479
I just put us on an
indefinite permanent break.

03:19.171 --> 03:22.447
HEATHER: I don't know what
my identity is right now.

03:22.472 --> 03:25.658
Should I say I am a bartender?

03:26.057 --> 03:28.134
A lover of cheese?

03:28.279 --> 03:29.945
A chewer of gum?

03:29.947 --> 03:35.034
Like, I'm all of those
things, but none define me.

03:35.036 --> 03:36.669
Honey, that's all very interesting,

03:36.671 --> 03:39.955
but this is a podcast
about relationships.

03:40.249 --> 03:43.019
We want to know about your relationship.

03:43.044 --> 03:45.294
Yeah, well, it's just awkward,

03:45.296 --> 03:47.513
because Hector's sitting right there,

03:47.515 --> 03:49.398
and he's your son, so...

03:49.717 --> 03:51.016
Oh, it's okay.

03:51.018 --> 03:53.405
Whatever you want to say
to me, you can say to me,

03:53.430 --> 03:57.547
my mom and our 334 subscribers

03:57.572 --> 03:59.775
to Dating For All Ages,
which is brought to you

03:59.777 --> 04:02.194
by Merv's Diner, on
4th and East Cameron.

04:02.196 --> 04:05.202
Mention the podcast, and you
get a free ham and cheese.

04:05.227 --> 04:07.316
I guess what I would like to know

04:07.318 --> 04:08.817
is where do you two stand?

04:08.819 --> 04:10.750
How serious are you?

04:11.372 --> 04:15.574
Well, I really like Hector, and...

04:15.576 --> 04:17.326
our names definitely go well together.

04:17.327 --> 04:18.961
Our couple name is "Heactor,"

04:18.963 --> 04:21.284
like "Hector," but with an extra A.

04:21.596 --> 04:24.717
But I can't really make any decisions

04:24.719 --> 04:29.034
about our relationship
until I sort out who I am.

04:29.363 --> 04:31.840
Heather, I just want to take our
relationship to the next level,

04:31.842 --> 04:33.870
become more officially a couple.

04:33.895 --> 04:37.346
Well, another challenge is that
you live here with your mom,

04:37.348 --> 04:39.932
who's your best friend,
so there's also that...

04:40.507 --> 04:43.269
(crunching)

04:45.838 --> 04:47.823
Oh. Sorry.

04:47.825 --> 04:49.191
Dude, we're recording.

04:49.193 --> 04:50.359
When I said you could stay here,

04:50.361 --> 04:52.828
I said we needed it quiet
during pod-casting hours.

04:52.830 --> 04:54.330
Yeah, totally. I just...

04:54.332 --> 04:56.949
I-I just want to get the
tasty scragglers at the bottom.

04:56.951 --> 04:58.834
Um, but... you guys keep going.

04:58.836 --> 05:00.119
I-I'm loving this.

05:00.121 --> 05:02.004
I-I'll just scrag more quietly.

05:02.006 --> 05:03.255
(chuckles)

05:03.257 --> 05:05.457
(crunching)

05:07.795 --> 05:09.011
Oh, yeah, no, no.

05:09.013 --> 05:10.963
This is just gonna be too loud.

05:10.965 --> 05:14.767
I'll-I'll just put them away.

05:14.769 --> 05:16.135
Do you have a chip clip?

05:16.137 --> 05:17.769
No?

05:21.769 --> 05:24.109
Hi. There you are. Uh...

05:24.111 --> 05:25.778
Of all the law firms in all the towns,

05:25.780 --> 05:27.386
I had to walk into this one.

05:27.878 --> 05:29.152
What are you doing here?

05:29.207 --> 05:33.232
Um, I am here to tell you
that I have amazing news.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.285
You're leaving town again?

05:37.541 --> 05:40.626
No. I'm ready to come back to work.

05:41.386 --> 05:43.078
- Where?
- Here.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.747
- How?
- What?

05:44.749 --> 05:46.548
You don't work here anymore, Rebecca.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.050
You resigned, remember?

05:48.052 --> 05:49.385
What... no, I didn't resign.

05:49.387 --> 05:51.920
My mother resigned for me
while she was drugging me,

05:51.922 --> 05:53.222
so that's not legal.

05:53.224 --> 05:54.506
Oh, I see your point.

05:54.508 --> 05:55.611
- Yes.
- You didn't resign.

05:55.636 --> 05:56.508
No.

05:56.510 --> 05:57.676
- You still work here.
- Yes.

05:58.154 --> 05:59.706
And now, you're fired.

06:06.637 --> 06:08.353
Oh, hey, boss.

06:10.441 --> 06:11.824
Kevin, can I...

06:11.826 --> 06:13.105
help you with something?

06:13.130 --> 06:15.027
Oh, I just wanted to, uh...

06:15.029 --> 06:17.613
I have a good reason for
asking this, I swear...

06:17.792 --> 06:19.748
Uh, if someone asked...

06:19.750 --> 06:23.839
Not me, but someone...
What would you say you are?

06:25.261 --> 06:27.089
(inhales) S... what?

06:27.091 --> 06:29.508
Well, you know, like,
uh, where are you from?

06:29.510 --> 06:32.711
Oh, um, I was born in Arizona,

06:32.713 --> 06:35.514
and then my dad, his job transferred

06:35.516 --> 06:36.965
- from there to here...
- Yeah... I-I'm sorry.

06:36.967 --> 06:39.151
I-I meant, where are your parents from?

06:39.557 --> 06:42.888
Yeah, um, well, my mom is from Michigan,

06:42.890 --> 06:45.107
and my dad is from Michigan.

06:45.666 --> 06:47.609
They met at University of Michigan.

06:47.611 --> 06:49.361
So, crazy story, huh?

06:49.363 --> 06:50.979
(nervous chuckle)

06:52.502 --> 06:55.544
Kevin, are you trying to ask
me what my ethnic background is?

06:55.569 --> 06:56.785
- No.
- No?

06:56.787 --> 06:57.903
I mean, yes.

06:57.905 --> 06:59.988
Yeah. I-I mean, not because

06:59.990 --> 07:01.957
I-I care about what you are,

07:01.959 --> 07:03.792
I mean, you can be anything you want.

07:03.794 --> 07:05.160
Oh... Oh, thank you.

07:05.162 --> 07:06.912
I mean, you're obviously something!

07:06.914 --> 07:09.164
(laughs) Uh, I mean, we...

07:09.166 --> 07:11.500
we have never talked about...

07:11.502 --> 07:14.670
I mean, I've wondered...
Though, for no reason.

07:14.672 --> 07:16.171
Oh, God,

07:16.173 --> 07:18.006
this is a disaster, isn't it?

07:18.008 --> 07:19.842
And I'm so hot.

07:19.844 --> 07:21.009
(grunts)

07:21.011 --> 07:22.177
Okay, well...

07:22.179 --> 07:23.312
Oh!

07:23.314 --> 07:24.980
You took it off.

07:24.982 --> 07:26.982
Oh. The point is,

07:26.984 --> 07:31.270
it doesn't matter what race
you are, you are my equal.

07:31.272 --> 07:32.604
- (panting)
- Oh, okay.

07:32.606 --> 07:35.524
Kevin, did you, um,
did you have a point,

07:35.526 --> 07:37.659
- or is this just for fun?
- Yes!

07:37.661 --> 07:38.901
Yes.

07:38.926 --> 07:42.831
There's a training program

07:42.833 --> 07:44.750
at Home Base corporate,

07:44.752 --> 07:48.862
and they are encouraging
people who are...

07:50.536 --> 07:51.799
who are...

07:53.594 --> 07:55.627
(breathless): S-Say it...

07:55.629 --> 07:57.880
Dear God in Heaven, please.

07:57.882 --> 07:59.181
Diverse?

07:59.183 --> 08:02.050
(panting): Yes. Yes.

08:02.052 --> 08:03.526
Oh...

08:04.271 --> 08:06.472
Kevin, all you had to say was, like,

08:06.474 --> 08:09.057
"Hey, there's a corporate
management training program,

08:09.059 --> 08:10.559
here's a form."

08:10.561 --> 08:12.448
Right. Here's a form.

08:12.863 --> 08:14.784
REBECCA: Wait. I'm fired?

08:14.809 --> 08:16.532
Um, are... are you angry at me

08:16.534 --> 08:17.733
because of what happened between us?

08:17.735 --> 08:19.034
Because I told you,

08:19.036 --> 08:21.370
that had nothing to do with
you, that-that was all me.

08:21.372 --> 08:22.905
Oh, really? You're gonna hit me with

08:22.907 --> 08:24.156
the "it's not you, it's me"?

08:24.158 --> 08:25.657
Next thing I know, you're gonna hit me

08:25.659 --> 08:27.409
with the "I was going through a thing."

08:27.411 --> 08:30.078
I... was going through a thing.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.080
I'm... still going through a thing,

08:32.082 --> 08:33.549
I'm trying to get healthy in my life.

08:33.551 --> 08:34.633
Oh, "get healthy"?

08:34.635 --> 08:37.219
Really, Miss Personal Pan Pizza? Okay.

08:37.221 --> 08:39.587
- Good luck with that.
- Wow.

08:39.590 --> 08:40.672
So you're just gonna be

08:40.674 --> 08:42.090
a petulant little child
about this? Really?

08:42.092 --> 08:43.926
I am not being a child, okay?

08:43.928 --> 08:45.060
Now get out of my room.

08:45.062 --> 08:46.144
I mean, my office.

08:46.146 --> 08:47.346
Get out of my-my office.

08:48.053 --> 08:49.064
What is wrong with you?

08:49.066 --> 08:51.266
Why are you sweating like
Mickey Rourke after a meal

08:51.268 --> 08:53.569
- at Fogo de Chao?
- Nothing. Okay? I'm fine. (moans)

08:53.571 --> 08:55.020
SASSY. SASSY.

08:55.022 --> 08:56.688
"Sassy"? What are you
talking... I don't even know

08:56.690 --> 08:58.440
what you're talking about.
Just get out of my office.

08:58.442 --> 09:00.108
Okay, fine, it's too
hot in here, anyway.

09:00.110 --> 09:01.493
Good!

09:01.495 --> 09:03.362
Fine, I'm sweaty?

09:03.364 --> 09:04.947
I'll show you how sweaty I am.

09:04.949 --> 09:07.616
Okay, real professional.

09:07.618 --> 09:09.918
That was disgusting!

09:09.920 --> 09:11.286
I'm not a child!

09:11.288 --> 09:12.955
I'm not a... where's my ball?

09:17.030 --> 09:18.176
(exhales)

09:18.178 --> 09:20.178
What happened in there? Are you okay?

09:20.180 --> 09:21.463
(panting): Yeah. I'm fine.

09:21.465 --> 09:22.798
(sniffles) I just think

09:22.800 --> 09:24.967
the, uh, I think it's just
the hormones kicking in.

09:24.969 --> 09:27.853
And also, Nathaniel was
really horrible to me in there.

09:27.855 --> 09:28.971
Uh, he fired me.

09:29.223 --> 09:31.139
Yeah, and, like, in a really mean way.

09:31.141 --> 09:34.049
He insulted my... personal
pan pizzas... anyway,

09:34.074 --> 09:35.777
uh, I don't have to tell
you guys this, though.

09:35.779 --> 09:37.446
You know what a monster he can be.

09:37.448 --> 09:38.564
Actually, he's been okay lately.

09:38.566 --> 09:39.815
MAYA: Yeah. Yesterday,

09:39.817 --> 09:41.283
he patted me on the head, although,

09:41.285 --> 09:43.318
he might've been trying to stand up.

09:43.320 --> 09:45.821
He's been taking your
bust-up pretty well, actually.

09:45.823 --> 09:48.312
Clearly not. He's clearly
devastated and lashing out.

09:48.337 --> 09:51.000
Mm, I don't know if
he's that devastated.

09:51.289 --> 09:52.961
He's got this new gal pal.

09:52.963 --> 09:54.796
Darryl. That was an office secret.

09:54.798 --> 09:56.999
It was on the group
text chain called, "Shh!"

09:57.001 --> 09:58.467
Hold up. New gal pal?

09:58.469 --> 10:01.303
Yeah, this new girlfriend
is all over his Instagram.

10:01.305 --> 10:02.961
He is flaunting her everywhere.

10:02.986 --> 10:04.306
He's even tagging her in photos

10:04.308 --> 10:06.391
that she's not in: sunsets,

10:06.393 --> 10:07.342
rescue dogs,

10:07.344 --> 10:08.677
farmers' market.

10:08.679 --> 10:09.645
Can someone give me their phone?

10:09.647 --> 10:10.679
Honey, no, no, no.

10:10.681 --> 10:11.680
That's not a good idea.

10:11.682 --> 10:12.848
You're off social media, remember?

10:12.850 --> 10:14.807
REBECCA: It's fine. Okay.

10:15.185 --> 10:16.401
I'm s... I'm sorry, Tim,

10:16.403 --> 10:18.737
why is your phone background
a picture of Shania Twain?

10:18.739 --> 10:21.323
She's beautiful, she is from Canada

10:21.325 --> 10:24.370
and she raised her brothers
and sisters all on her own.

10:24.395 --> 10:26.662
- That doesn't impress me much.
- REBECCA: Okay.

10:26.664 --> 10:28.330
Ha... oh, there she is.

10:28.332 --> 10:29.831
Okay, well...

10:29.833 --> 10:31.533
You know what? She's beautiful.

10:31.535 --> 10:34.838
She also went to Stanford.

10:35.214 --> 10:36.747
And she works in a mutual fund.

10:36.874 --> 10:38.292
She's perfect for him.

10:38.876 --> 10:41.710
There. See? I'm fine.

10:43.177 --> 10:44.627
(gasps) No.

10:44.715 --> 10:47.516
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. This can't be.

10:47.518 --> 10:49.718
Did he take her home to meet his family?

10:49.720 --> 10:51.053
Did he propose?

10:51.055 --> 10:52.723
Way worse.

10:53.797 --> 10:54.996
The worsest.

10:57.061 --> 10:58.727
REBECCA: He took her to Raging Waters!

11:00.564 --> 11:02.230
That's her Paris.

11:02.232 --> 11:04.316
- (gasps)
- REBECCA: No.

11:04.318 --> 11:06.864
I mean, he can't be
allowed to do this to me...

11:07.237 --> 11:08.737
you, all of us.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.038
I mean, guys,

11:10.040 --> 11:11.406
have you forgotten what he was like

11:11.408 --> 11:12.928
the first week he came here?

11:12.953 --> 11:14.743
He instantly wanted to fire all of you.

11:14.745 --> 11:17.746
And, Darryl, um, hello...
He stole your firm.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.298
He scooped up your
ex-wife Stacey's shares

11:20.300 --> 11:21.383
behind your back.

11:21.385 --> 11:22.751
Oh, that's true.

11:22.753 --> 11:24.386
REBECCA: Oh, no, no, no, no.

11:24.757 --> 11:27.889
He cannot do this. I say we fight back,

11:27.891 --> 11:29.675
and we take this firm back.

11:29.677 --> 11:30.592
(all groaning)

11:30.594 --> 11:32.644
That sounds a little aggressive

11:32.646 --> 11:33.895
I don't know how I feel about that.

11:33.897 --> 11:35.097
Maybe we could just write him a letter.

11:35.099 --> 11:36.515
Oh, guys, guys!

11:36.517 --> 11:37.849
- What?
- Huh?

Honey, nice to meet you.

(high, feminine voice):
Oh, hello, Chocolate.

13:30.546 --> 13:32.276
Ooh, do you want to make
love in Rebecca's mouth?

13:32.301 --> 13:33.450
Yeah!

13:33.971 --> 13:36.823
Mmm. Hungry hormone feast.

13:36.848 --> 13:38.737
Hey, Hector, have you heard
about the cool thing I'm doing?

13:38.777 --> 13:40.362
I'm taking my firm back.

13:40.795 --> 13:43.096
Nathaniel hoodwinked and
bamboozled Darryl to get it,

13:43.098 --> 13:45.314
and now I'm gonna
hornswoggle him right back.

13:45.316 --> 13:47.517
- She talks like an old lady.
- Mm-hmm.

13:47.519 --> 13:49.519
I prefer '40s detective, but thank you.

13:49.521 --> 13:51.437
Wait, how are you gonna
take back the firm?

13:51.439 --> 13:52.772
That's what I'm trying to suss out now,

13:52.774 --> 13:54.073
my bird-boned friend.

13:54.075 --> 13:56.409
I have to find some
way to undermine him.

13:56.434 --> 13:58.077
Oh, you know what you could do...

13:58.079 --> 13:59.362
Try the dark Internet.

13:59.364 --> 14:01.781
People do all kinds of
creepy stuff on there.

14:01.783 --> 14:03.583
My friend met someone on the dark web

14:03.846 --> 14:07.370
that made her stepdad disappear.

14:07.372 --> 14:08.871
I don't know about that, Hector.

14:08.873 --> 14:10.339
I mean, that seems a little bit extreme.

14:10.341 --> 14:11.674
Ah! Damn it!

14:11.676 --> 14:13.042
Oh, man...

14:13.044 --> 14:14.223
Ahh.

14:14.879 --> 14:16.379
Hey, Heather, wait, what are you doing

14:16.381 --> 14:17.885
dressed all Good Wife?

14:17.910 --> 14:20.516
I mean, usually you have your
entire midriff hanging out.

14:20.518 --> 14:22.051
Like, we get it, you're skinny.

14:22.053 --> 14:23.936
I'm sorry. Um, that was rude.

14:23.938 --> 14:25.207
I'm very hormonal.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.723
Well, I applied for that Home Base

14:27.725 --> 14:29.308
management training program.

14:29.310 --> 14:30.526
I don't know, I'm a little worried

14:30.528 --> 14:31.561
it's gonna be too uptight for me.

14:31.563 --> 14:33.396
Their dress code is so conservative.

14:33.398 --> 14:36.232
It's like, no tattoos, no
body drawing, no hair dye.

14:36.234 --> 14:37.490
It's, like, my whole look.

14:37.819 --> 14:40.203
I guess I'll just have to
express my colorful personality

14:40.205 --> 14:41.959
with my animated vocal inflections.

14:42.157 --> 14:44.040
Ah! I found it! Sorry.

14:44.042 --> 14:45.408
I found the loophole.

14:45.410 --> 14:46.576
I know how to get the firm back.

14:46.578 --> 14:49.045
I gotta go... assemble the team.

14:49.047 --> 14:50.377
Congratulations.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.251
MAN: Well, trainees, on behalf of

14:55.253 --> 14:58.470
Home Base Industries and
Three Strikes You're In, LLC,

14:58.556 --> 15:00.931
welcome to the orientation

15:00.956 --> 15:02.592
for the management training program.

15:02.594 --> 15:04.727
You guys have been
selected from Home Bases

15:04.729 --> 15:05.978
across the land...

15:05.980 --> 15:08.097
By "across the land" I mean the northern

15:08.099 --> 15:09.890
southwestern region of California...

15:09.915 --> 15:12.318
To begin your new careers.

15:12.681 --> 15:14.384
Congratulations, folks.

15:14.906 --> 15:17.273
You've gotten to first base. (chuckles)

15:17.275 --> 15:19.609
- (forced chuckles)
- That's so Du...

15:19.611 --> 15:20.693
Okay, so,

15:20.695 --> 15:22.195
any questions at all?

15:22.197 --> 15:24.280
Uh, yeah, I have a few.

15:24.282 --> 15:25.581
- Mm-hmm.
- First,

15:25.583 --> 15:27.333
are there going to be
constant baseball puns?

15:27.335 --> 15:28.751
Because that's strike one.

15:28.753 --> 15:30.703
Get it? Be... Um...

15:30.705 --> 15:32.726
Also, we're supposed to wear pantyhose,

15:32.751 --> 15:34.624
but pantyhose are actually not sanitary.

15:34.626 --> 15:36.898
They trap all the juices.

15:37.295 --> 15:38.961
Like, scientifically.

15:38.963 --> 15:40.463
You know.

15:41.549 --> 15:46.385
Oh, yep, this is super
uptight. (clears throat)

15:46.387 --> 15:48.837
I know how we can obliterate Nathaniel.

15:49.057 --> 15:51.023
I mean, take the firm back.

15:51.025 --> 15:53.359
So, here's what happened. When Nathaniel

15:53.361 --> 15:54.977
bought Stacey's shares,

15:54.979 --> 15:56.646
the transaction was not executed

15:56.648 --> 15:59.115
in the correct county, because
Stacey lives in Orange County.

15:59.117 --> 16:00.233
Of course she does.

16:00.235 --> 16:02.318
So the transfer of the shares needed

16:02.320 --> 16:04.654
to be notarized in
the local jurisdiction.

16:04.656 --> 16:06.539
(yawning): This is boring.
What are you saying?

16:06.541 --> 16:08.124
(exhales) I'm saying

16:08.126 --> 16:10.159
that if we can get those shares voided,

16:10.161 --> 16:12.995
buy them back, we will
control 60% of the firm,

16:12.997 --> 16:15.831
making us all the controlling entity.

16:15.833 --> 16:17.967
(snaps fingers) Any questions?

16:17.969 --> 16:20.169
Yeah, I have one. Instead
of doing all of this,

16:20.171 --> 16:22.004
why don't you just get
a job somewhere else?

16:22.006 --> 16:23.306
You could go anywhere.

16:23.308 --> 16:25.057
Yeah, you could probably
take all of us with you, too.

16:25.059 --> 16:27.343
- Might be fun.
- I personally would like to work

16:27.345 --> 16:29.395
at a firm where I could
be outside all day.

16:29.397 --> 16:30.980
You know, like Google or SpaceX.

16:30.982 --> 16:32.398
Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys. This is...

16:32.400 --> 16:34.850
this is not about having a job

16:34.852 --> 16:37.687
or getting health
insurance or being happier

16:37.689 --> 16:39.787
or being in fresh air. No, no, no.

16:39.812 --> 16:43.409
This is about justice for all of us.

16:43.411 --> 16:45.695
It's about... it's
about good versus evil.

16:45.697 --> 16:47.697
You guys know that. Come on.

16:47.699 --> 16:48.864
Head back in the game.

16:48.866 --> 16:50.950
I am going to get Stacey
to file with the court

16:50.952 --> 16:53.119
to get us a hearing to void
the transfer of the shares.

16:53.121 --> 16:54.670
Mm, how are you gonna do that?

16:54.672 --> 16:57.873
My ex-wife can be one tough nut.

16:58.358 --> 16:59.842
REBECCA: This is nice, but...

17:00.186 --> 17:02.128
this was really $10,000?

17:02.130 --> 17:03.379
Sure was.

17:03.381 --> 17:05.097
Wait until you feel these jets.

17:05.545 --> 17:07.550
- Oh!
- Right?

17:07.551 --> 17:10.303
- Mmm.
- (whoops)

17:10.305 --> 17:13.888
(chuckles): Wow, I would really
love five minutes alone in here

17:13.891 --> 17:15.775
with my phone browser set to private.

17:15.777 --> 17:19.194
Sorry. I'm, uh... very horny right now.

17:19.196 --> 17:20.896
- My body's making an egg.
- Oh.

17:20.897 --> 17:23.115
That's right, you're making
a baby with my ex-husband.

17:23.117 --> 17:24.733
That's kind of weird.

17:24.736 --> 17:28.371
Yeah, so my sex drive is
just... it's off the charts.

17:28.664 --> 17:30.873
Okay, what is it that you want?

17:31.179 --> 17:33.492
I mean, you invited yourself over here.

17:33.494 --> 17:36.329
You showed up with a bottle
of wine and your bathing suit,

17:36.331 --> 17:37.747
said you had an offer I couldn't refuse,

17:37.749 --> 17:40.499
and now you're talking about
your sex drive? (chuckles)

17:40.501 --> 17:42.251
I'm not bi. Sorry.

17:42.253 --> 17:44.197
- Darryl's the bi one.
- Hey, you know what?

17:44.222 --> 17:45.221
I'm not bi, either.

17:45.223 --> 17:47.089
I mean, I have certain bi tendencies.

17:47.091 --> 17:49.058
Mm-hmm. Honestly, Kinsey
scale, I'm probably a 1.8.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.760
But anyway, Stacey,
this is about business.

17:50.762 --> 17:52.762
So, all right, those shares

17:52.764 --> 17:54.480
in the Whitefeather firm
that you sold to Nathaniel...

17:54.946 --> 17:56.399
Which, by the way, I mean,

17:56.401 --> 17:58.601
was just not the nicest
thing to do to Darryl.

17:58.603 --> 18:01.070
(scoffs) I'm an incredibly nice person.

18:01.072 --> 18:02.238
(baby crying)

18:02.240 --> 18:05.408
Would you turn that baby off?!

18:05.410 --> 18:07.777
- (baby whimpers)
- I'm sorry, just, ugh, these neighbors.

18:07.779 --> 18:09.198
Am I right?

18:09.223 --> 18:10.780
Look, I got those Whitefeather shares

18:10.782 --> 18:12.164
fair and square in my divorce.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.582
- So...
- Okay, you did,

18:13.584 --> 18:15.368
but when you sold them to Nathaniel,

18:15.370 --> 18:16.702
you put that firm in the hands

18:16.704 --> 18:19.622
of someone who is
systematically exploiting people

18:19.624 --> 18:21.123
and taking some other people

18:21.125 --> 18:22.591
to water parks for no apparent reason.

18:22.593 --> 18:23.676
Wait, what?

18:23.678 --> 18:25.094
Nothing. Okay, Stacey,

18:25.096 --> 18:27.430
what if I told you that
I could void that sale

18:27.432 --> 18:28.547
and then buy those shares back?

18:28.549 --> 18:30.182
- (baby cries)
- I heard that,

18:30.184 --> 18:32.351
- you stupid baby!
- Okay, I want to...

18:32.353 --> 18:32.913
(crying continues)

18:32.938 --> 18:34.677
I want to take that
evil Nathaniel to court

18:34.702 --> 18:37.940
and void the sale and then
get the shares back, so, huh?

18:37.942 --> 18:39.475
And why would I do that?

18:39.477 --> 18:41.777
Come on, Stacey, there
must be something you want.

18:41.779 --> 18:43.446
Shut up, baby!

18:43.448 --> 18:45.614
Just shut it down!

18:48.920 --> 18:51.287
(sighs) Your Honor, we are here today

18:51.289 --> 18:52.988
to establish that Mr. Plimpton

18:52.990 --> 18:55.074
acquired the shares of
the Whitefeather firm

18:55.309 --> 18:58.341
- through fraudulent manipulation and...
- (knocking at door)

19:01.082 --> 19:02.381
You're suing me?

looking out for the-the
people of Whitfeather.

19:24.898 --> 19:26.815
Just tell me, how did
you convince Stacey

19:26.817 --> 19:28.149
to contest the sale of the shares?

19:28.151 --> 19:30.201
I volunteered to represent her for free

19:30.203 --> 19:32.654
in her noise complaint lawsuit
against the baby next door.

19:32.656 --> 19:33.939
Not the parents. The baby.

19:33.941 --> 19:35.740
She was very specific about that.

19:35.742 --> 19:37.609
Stacey's not a nice person, actually.

19:37.611 --> 19:38.753
I know what this is.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.839
You're trying to get back
at me for not rehiring you

19:40.864 --> 19:42.163
and for the Raging Waters...

19:42.165 --> 19:44.643
Oh! Oh, so you admit it.

19:44.870 --> 19:46.534
Raging Waters was just

19:46.536 --> 19:48.203
to rub your new relationship in my face.

19:48.205 --> 19:49.921
Oh, my God. It's so
transparent. (chuckles)

19:49.923 --> 19:51.745
Look, it's not my fault
that you can't get over me.

19:51.770 --> 19:54.175
Oh. (scoffs) I am over you.

19:54.177 --> 19:56.378
I am totally over you.

19:56.380 --> 19:58.380
- Mm-hmm. Sure. Uh-huh.
- Yeah. I am dating someone

19:58.382 --> 20:01.766
who's funny, intelligent, not crazy.

20:01.768 --> 20:02.717
- "Not crazy"?
- Yeah.

20:02.719 --> 20:04.970
- Oh, oh, oh, nice word. Screw you.
- Screw you.

20:04.972 --> 20:06.471
- Screw you.
- Screw you.

20:06.473 --> 20:07.853
I don't think about you at all anymore.

20:07.900 --> 20:09.891
- I don't think about you, either.
- I never think about you

20:09.893 --> 20:11.943
when I'm home alone in bed
under the covers, warm at night.

20:11.945 --> 20:13.445
I don't think about you
when I'm in a hot tub

20:13.447 --> 20:15.063
- with high-powered jets.
- What?

20:15.065 --> 20:16.398
Nothing. So, we agree.

20:16.400 --> 20:18.366
This conflict is just about
the legalities of the case.

20:18.368 --> 20:19.901
Yeah, we agree.

20:20.126 --> 20:21.736
- Fine, I'll see you in court!
- Oh, yeah.

20:21.738 --> 20:25.240
- I'll see you in court.
- Aah, wear a suit! What?

20:25.242 --> 20:27.626
(sighs, panting)

20:27.628 --> 20:29.577
Heather, just don't disturb me!

20:29.579 --> 20:31.579
I'll be in my room for
eight to ten minutes!

20:31.899 --> 20:33.548
Oh, right, she's at work.

20:33.550 --> 20:35.289
I'm gonna borrow her vibrator.

20:44.201 --> 20:46.785
Heather, we need to talk.

20:47.196 --> 20:48.847
Oh, what, I'm fired

20:48.849 --> 20:51.099
because Linda saw my butt piercing?

20:51.101 --> 20:53.935
That thing is really hard
to get out. You try it.

20:53.937 --> 20:55.103
No, not that.

20:55.105 --> 20:56.938
No, I have great news.

20:56.940 --> 21:00.645
Your idea to add dessert
tapas to the menu,

21:01.598 --> 21:04.114
I pitched it to menu technologies

21:04.139 --> 21:07.225
and they came back with
a good deal of enthusiasm.

21:07.250 --> 21:08.616
Oh, yeah.

21:08.618 --> 21:11.119
They are gonna run it up
the ladder, circle back

21:11.121 --> 21:13.788
and send it down the chain. (laughs)

21:13.790 --> 21:16.877
Is that, like, corporate talk
for saying I had a good idea?

21:16.902 --> 21:19.400
Uh, yeah. A good idea.

21:19.596 --> 21:20.572
Cool.

21:20.597 --> 21:22.464
Um, I have another one.

21:23.025 --> 21:25.967
We should institute a rideshare
service at all locations

21:25.969 --> 21:27.802
because we're basically
putting drunk parents

21:27.804 --> 21:28.970
into cars with their children.

21:28.972 --> 21:32.428
My God, you are a visionary. Yeah.

21:32.453 --> 21:35.553
Yeah. I also don't want kids to die,

21:35.578 --> 21:37.694
but, uh, yeah.

21:38.921 --> 21:40.115
Okay, guys.

21:40.117 --> 21:41.483
I got this.

21:41.485 --> 21:42.734
I'm gonna knock it out of the park.

21:42.736 --> 21:44.486
- Okay.
- (door opens)

21:50.411 --> 21:52.567
This court is in session.

21:52.592 --> 21:55.878
Ms. Bunch, Mr. Plimpton,
your arguments may begin.

21:55.903 --> 22:00.168
Your Honor, we are here
today to establish that

22:00.170 --> 22:02.317
Mr. Plimpton's acquisition of the shares

22:02.342 --> 22:04.216
in the Whitefeather firm was fraudulent.

22:04.241 --> 22:07.759
That argument should be
rejected on a prima facie basis.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.005
It is absurd.

22:09.030 --> 22:11.179
Manipulating a transaction

22:11.181 --> 22:13.348
to gain a jurisdictional advantage

22:13.350 --> 22:14.723
is dishonest and cannot be abided.

22:14.748 --> 22:16.651
Your claims are overstated

22:16.653 --> 22:19.237
and stretch the legal limits
of local arbitration laws.

22:19.239 --> 22:20.528
Can you guys look at me?

22:20.553 --> 22:22.690
I can barely hear what you're saying.

22:23.614 --> 22:25.731
- Of course, Your Honor.
- Sorry, Your Honor.

24:29.548 --> 24:30.931

it again from the top?

- Oh.

24:35.304 --> 24:36.520

24:36.522 --> 24:38.522
Ms. Bunch, I rule in your favor.

24:38.524 --> 24:40.307
The transaction is void.

Stacey Whitefeather.

24:42.216 --> 24:44.644
Who is selling them to us.

24:45.814 --> 24:47.030
Oh, my God.

24:47.032 --> 24:48.865
Ah, you're so sweaty.

24:48.867 --> 24:50.534
I know, it's just... it's a whole...

24:50.536 --> 24:52.452
- it's a whole thing.
- Aah.

24:54.237 --> 24:57.157
This is amazing, but now
we have to buy the shares.

24:57.159 --> 24:59.159
I mean, how are we gonna do
that? None of us have any money.

24:59.161 --> 25:00.996
Don't worry. I got it covered.

25:08.337 --> 25:10.337
It's been in my family for generations.

25:10.566 --> 25:14.257
Legend has it that the stone
was mined from the same mountain

25:14.259 --> 25:15.972
as Chaim Potok's wife's wedding ring.

25:16.729 --> 25:17.677
It's fake.

25:17.679 --> 25:19.229
What?

25:19.231 --> 25:20.680
Oh, it's completely fake.

25:21.023 --> 25:22.232
What? No, no. No.

25:22.234 --> 25:24.538
How-how can the Garfinkel
ring not be real?

25:25.604 --> 25:26.686
I sold this.

25:26.688 --> 25:28.989
I sold this to a pawn
shop on East Cameron.

25:28.991 --> 25:30.440
Oh, that place went out of business.

25:30.465 --> 25:32.715
Poor sap was buying fake jewelry.

25:33.668 --> 25:35.355
Oh, my God.

25:42.587 --> 25:43.837
Paula, we need money.

25:43.862 --> 25:45.445
We don't have money.
What are we gonna do?

25:45.618 --> 25:47.282
We don't have any cabbage, scratch,

25:47.307 --> 25:48.623
no clams, no grilled cheese.

25:48.843 --> 25:50.893
Is grilled cheese
old-timey slang for money?

25:50.895 --> 25:52.945
No, I just really want a grilled cheese.

25:52.947 --> 25:55.204
Oh, with marshmallows.
God, I'm so hormonal.

25:55.220 --> 25:57.720
Okay, you got to know
somebody with money.

25:57.722 --> 26:00.006
I mean, you grew up in Richistan.

26:00.008 --> 26:01.507
Don't you all have cocktail parties

26:01.509 --> 26:02.675
where you just stand around

26:02.677 --> 26:04.510
and talk about how to
get more tax breaks or...

26:04.512 --> 26:05.511
Paula, you bring up a point.

26:05.513 --> 26:07.182
I do know some rich people.

26:07.682 --> 26:10.016
Look, Audra and I have
been friends a long time,

26:10.018 --> 26:12.235
and you and I shared that
magical night together,

26:12.237 --> 26:13.853
and I just thought,
you're always talking about

26:13.855 --> 26:15.658
how rich you are, so, you
know, it's no skin off your...

26:15.686 --> 26:18.958
Yeah, I-I'm rich because I don't
give money to idiots like you.

26:18.983 --> 26:20.084
And will you please

26:20.109 --> 26:22.131
stop telling people
that I'm a terrible lay

26:22.156 --> 26:23.989
and that I have a small hmm?

26:24.014 --> 26:25.630
It's sufficient.

26:26.139 --> 26:27.561
You must be so proud.

26:29.484 --> 26:31.117
BJ NOVAK: What don't
you understand, Rebecca?

26:31.119 --> 26:33.570
My ecstasy factory is losing money.

26:33.572 --> 26:34.704
Everything's about opioids now.

26:34.706 --> 26:37.824
No one wants good, artisanal ecstasy.

26:37.826 --> 26:39.876
God, BJ, you went to Harvard.

26:39.878 --> 26:42.462
It's called being a hyphenate, Rebecca.

26:42.464 --> 26:44.146
Look it up.

26:45.667 --> 26:47.967
Come on, buddy, help me out.

26:47.969 --> 26:49.135
I don't know you.

26:49.137 --> 26:52.889
You keep saying you met
me at some boba stand.

26:52.891 --> 26:55.642
Listen, I don't remember
individual bobas.

26:55.644 --> 26:57.654
I boba three or four times a week.

26:57.679 --> 27:00.229
Now stop pestering my assistant.

27:00.231 --> 27:01.898
No, no, no, Dr. Phil, please don't go.

27:01.900 --> 27:03.316
(Skype call ends)

27:03.318 --> 27:05.568
(Rebecca exhales)

27:12.028 --> 27:12.992
Hey.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.578
I have a lot of feelings about my job

27:15.580 --> 27:16.946
and I want to talk about them.

27:16.948 --> 27:18.948
Okay, so, I like having a real job.

27:18.950 --> 27:20.366
I feel like I have a lot to contribute.

27:20.368 --> 27:22.335
Also, what am I saying? I'm crushing it.

27:22.337 --> 27:23.953
I'm doing better than any other trainee.

27:23.955 --> 27:25.755
Also, having dental insurance is nice.

27:25.757 --> 27:27.206
My wisdom teeth are on the move.

27:27.546 --> 27:29.626
But I really don't like
the corporate environment

27:29.628 --> 27:32.548
and sports wordplay and
I miss my side hobbies,

27:32.573 --> 27:35.437
so, um, what do I do?

27:38.874 --> 27:42.472
Well, do you have a lot
of money I could use?

27:42.607 --> 27:43.781
Me?

27:43.975 --> 27:46.007
You pay my rent, so...

27:46.749 --> 27:48.171
Oh, God.

27:48.897 --> 27:52.398
Oh, God, I-I really, I really messed up.

27:52.400 --> 27:55.034
Um, so, I told a bunch of people
that they could have something

27:55.036 --> 27:57.070
and they can't and I got their hopes up.

27:57.765 --> 27:58.871
And, oh, God.

27:58.873 --> 28:00.740
Oh, my hormones are out of control.

28:00.742 --> 28:02.375
It's like a hundred periods,

28:02.377 --> 28:03.960
plus what I imagine
cocaine would be like

28:03.962 --> 28:05.161
if I weren't too chicken to try it.

28:05.163 --> 28:07.246
- I...
- And here's the thing.

28:07.248 --> 28:08.851
The girl Nathaniel's dating,
it's killing me, okay?

28:09.281 --> 28:10.843
I say it's not, but it is.

28:11.419 --> 28:13.252
Every time I see a
picture of them, it just,

28:13.254 --> 28:15.838
it-it breaks my heart,
especially because she kind of

28:15.840 --> 28:17.256
looks like me, but she has, like,

28:17.258 --> 28:19.559
better eyebrows and
thick, lustrous hair.

28:19.561 --> 28:21.678
It's like if you put me in
a Disney princess machine.

28:21.680 --> 28:23.312
Oh, my God, I missed a shot.

28:23.314 --> 28:24.430
I got to go.

28:24.432 --> 28:25.848
Also, you should wash your vibrator.

28:28.486 --> 28:31.688
Wait... wait, what?

28:31.924 --> 28:33.473
What?

28:39.531 --> 28:41.698
(groans)

28:42.544 --> 28:44.760
(computer chimes)

28:48.416 --> 28:50.767
- (takes deep breath)
- _

28:51.258 --> 28:53.793
All right.

28:54.068 --> 28:58.219
Let's see who this whore is who
gets to go to my water parks.

28:58.243 --> 29:01.985
_

29:04.332 --> 29:06.332
_

29:07.344 --> 29:08.641
HECTOR: Try the dark Internet.

29:08.643 --> 29:10.476
(echoing): Dark Internet, dark Internet,

29:10.478 --> 29:13.646
- dark Internet, dark Internet...
- _

29:13.648 --> 29:16.616
(scoffs)

29:16.647 --> 29:18.647
_

29:19.266 --> 29:23.008
_

29:23.172 --> 29:25.321
_

29:25.390 --> 29:29.556
_

29:29.587 --> 29:31.798
(panting)

29:37.505 --> 29:39.388
REBECCA: So, it's possible, not certain,

29:39.390 --> 29:43.281
but possible that in a,
uh, hormone-fueled romp

29:43.306 --> 29:44.805
through the dark Internet last night,

29:44.807 --> 29:47.525
I may have ordered a hit on
Nathaniel's girlfriend, Mona.

29:47.527 --> 29:49.693
So, I, but it's okay. It's okay.

29:49.695 --> 29:50.728
I undid it this morning.

29:50.730 --> 29:51.812
I mean, at least I tried to.

29:51.814 --> 29:53.147
Hope I did. I think
I did. I probably did.

29:53.149 --> 29:54.482
But, um, yeah, so I'm starting to think

29:54.484 --> 29:57.368
that maybe the hormones, like,
were not the best idea for me.

29:57.370 --> 29:58.652
But I'm-I'm not ragging on hormones

29:58.654 --> 30:00.488
and egg donation, in general.

30:00.490 --> 30:01.455
Like, it's a wonderful thing.

30:01.457 --> 30:02.449
But, like, for me, in particular.

30:02.474 --> 30:04.802
Uh, that should've been obvious.

30:04.827 --> 30:06.794
We shouldn't be
discussing anything major

30:06.796 --> 30:08.074
until Dr. Shin gets here.

30:08.137 --> 30:09.604
Actually, guys, so,
don't-don't tell Dr. Shin

30:09.606 --> 30:11.305
anything that I just told you

30:11.307 --> 30:12.773
because I didn't check with him

30:12.775 --> 30:14.518
about this whole egg donation thing.

30:14.543 --> 30:16.460
I knew he would say it was a bad idea

30:16.462 --> 30:17.628
and I thought I could just

30:17.630 --> 30:19.011
SASSY my way through it.

30:19.036 --> 30:22.049
Is GASSY a thing?
Because I sit next to you

30:22.051 --> 30:24.371
and it seems like you eat a
lot of cruciferous veggies.

30:25.113 --> 30:29.856
Guys, look, I know I'm
super hormonal and irrational

30:29.858 --> 30:32.886
and rage-fueled right now,
but I... you know what?

30:32.911 --> 30:35.316
This takeover was a good
idea. It's a worthy cause.

30:35.341 --> 30:37.124
Yes, I know I was partly
doing it because of Nathaniel

30:37.149 --> 30:38.542
and his Insta-whore,

30:38.567 --> 30:41.285
but I really care about these people.

30:41.310 --> 30:44.011
You know, I-I care about all
those yutzes and-and he doesn't.

30:44.036 --> 30:46.543
I would be so much better of a boss,

30:46.568 --> 30:49.824
and now I don't have the
money to buy the shares,

30:49.849 --> 30:51.066
and I've had such a tough year

30:51.091 --> 30:52.511
and I just want to
fight for the little guy.

30:52.543 --> 30:54.961
You know? I want to, I want to
battle the corporate machine.

30:54.963 --> 30:57.747
- Yeah!
- Guys, guys, shut up.

30:57.749 --> 30:59.488
(chuckles) Dr. Shin is coming.

30:59.513 --> 31:01.667
Oh, guys, please, please,
don't tell him anything.

31:01.669 --> 31:02.969
Okay? Don't tell him anything. Right?

31:02.971 --> 31:07.222
Borderlines... go!

31:07.302 --> 31:08.785
Ew.

31:13.696 --> 31:15.079
(sighs)

31:19.027 --> 31:22.707
- Hey, Heather.
- Hey.

31:24.308 --> 31:25.574
It's good to see you.

31:26.019 --> 31:27.387
How's the program going?

31:27.699 --> 31:30.863
Ah, I miss this place.

31:31.215 --> 31:33.249
The smell of the fries,

31:33.251 --> 31:35.251
the sound of the fries,

31:35.253 --> 31:37.370
the heat from the fries.

31:37.372 --> 31:39.171
You want some fries?

31:39.173 --> 31:41.965
Yeah. Thanks.

31:43.177 --> 31:44.260
Gross.

31:44.262 --> 31:46.929
This place used to be my playground.

31:46.931 --> 31:48.347
It's still a playground.

31:48.349 --> 31:49.932
I mean, it's literally a playground.

31:49.934 --> 31:53.636
Chris, I don't know what to do.

31:53.638 --> 31:54.770
Me, neither.

31:54.772 --> 31:56.055
Both of my parents are drunk

31:56.057 --> 31:57.440
and I don't have a ride home.

31:58.148 --> 32:00.893
That's what I said.

32:00.895 --> 32:02.979
(sighs)

32:02.981 --> 32:05.064
- BERT: Have a good week.
- RICK: Yeah, next week.

32:05.066 --> 32:07.066
See you next week.

32:07.068 --> 32:08.451
(sighs) Rebecca. Oh, my God, Bert,

32:08.453 --> 32:09.485
I can't thank you enough

32:09.487 --> 32:11.237
for covering for me. I mean, God,

32:11.239 --> 32:12.989
you spent that whole session
talking about chemtrails.

32:12.991 --> 32:15.658
Governments use aircraft fumes
to spray us with sedatives.

32:15.660 --> 32:17.326
- Okay.
- That's why Americans

32:17.328 --> 32:18.521
are all so sleepy.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.663
Anyway, I wanted to tell you this.

32:20.665 --> 32:25.584
Few people know this about me,
but I am a Bitcoin thousandaire.

32:26.374 --> 32:28.041
Okay, wow. Uh, what?

32:28.043 --> 32:30.857
Yeah, so I have all this money
and nothing to spend it on.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.037
These fishing vests last a lifetime,

32:33.062 --> 32:34.538
especially if you never fish.

32:34.563 --> 32:36.697
What are you saying?

32:36.722 --> 32:39.556
I'm saying I'll give you
the money for your firm.

32:39.581 --> 32:41.721
- (gasps)
- I'll be a silent partner,

32:41.723 --> 32:43.115
and you can control the shares;
you can do whatever you want.

32:43.140 --> 32:45.600
Oh, my God,
Bert, Bert, you...

32:45.625 --> 32:47.819
you have no idea what this means to me.

32:47.875 --> 32:49.427
I mean, why would you even do this?

32:49.444 --> 32:51.661
Well, I like how you look
out for the little guy.

32:51.663 --> 32:54.113
And to tell you the truth,
I also need a tax break.

32:54.115 --> 32:55.581
Oh, God, Bert, thank
you, thank you so much.

32:55.583 --> 32:56.666
Oh, you're welcome.

32:56.668 --> 32:57.950
Oh, just don't squeeze too hard. Ooh.

32:57.952 --> 32:59.285
Just, oh, just my boobs.

32:59.287 --> 33:01.120
- They're giant melons of pain.
- I'm sorry.

33:01.122 --> 33:03.461
You've also got a pretty
big zit on your chin.

33:03.485 --> 33:05.375
I'm aware.

33:17.743 --> 33:19.443
What?

33:21.469 --> 33:24.024
Oh, of course. Okay.
What is going on?

33:24.079 --> 33:25.579
What's going on is that

33:25.581 --> 33:27.915
you are no longer the
senior partner at this firm.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.889
I found a semi-wealthy

33:29.891 --> 33:32.453
semi-friend to buy the voided shares,

33:32.478 --> 33:35.445
and he and Darryl have designated me

33:35.470 --> 33:37.386
as the proxy to make all the decisions.

33:37.411 --> 33:40.930
- So, I am now your superior.
- Superior?

33:41.407 --> 33:43.110
- You're not a man.
- Ah,

33:43.135 --> 33:45.086
things are gonna be a lot different

33:45.111 --> 33:46.994
around here, Nathaniel. Mm-mm-mm.

33:46.996 --> 33:49.280
30-hour workweeks,
mandatory nap breaks,

33:49.282 --> 33:51.665
- two-hour lunches.
- Oh, what's going on?

33:51.667 --> 33:52.866
Here, no, no, no, no, no, no.

33:52.868 --> 33:54.418
Get this garbage out of my office.

33:54.420 --> 33:56.253
Excuse me, that's not
garbage. That's Gloria.

33:56.255 --> 33:57.254
Estefan?

33:57.256 --> 33:59.924
No, Gloria Steinem and you knew that.
And this is our office now.

33:59.926 --> 34:01.875
See, Darryl is about to have a baby,

34:01.877 --> 34:03.928
courtesy of me and my powerful ovaries.

34:03.930 --> 34:06.078
So, get comfy.

34:06.103 --> 34:08.187
'Cause I'm moving in with you.

34:11.020 --> 34:13.804
FRANK: So, in the next four
years, we will have five

34:13.806 --> 34:15.973
new sites and 16 new menu items...

34:15.975 --> 34:16.940
Hey, Frank.

34:16.943 --> 34:18.442
Heather. Hi. Sorry to bother you

34:18.444 --> 34:21.110
during... whatever this boring
thing is that you're doing.

34:21.112 --> 34:23.569
Is this the refreshing
person you told us about?

34:23.594 --> 34:25.149
Dessert tapas.

34:25.150 --> 34:26.817
- (murmuring)
- HEATHER: Yes, that's me.

34:26.819 --> 34:28.569
Dessert tapas.

34:28.571 --> 34:30.621
So, I came here to quit, because I hate

34:30.623 --> 34:34.291
offices and conference rooms
and undergarments, but...

34:34.293 --> 34:35.960
no, I don't want to quit,

34:35.962 --> 34:37.828
because you guys
definitely need diversity.

34:37.830 --> 34:39.713
And I don't just mean people of color,

34:39.715 --> 34:41.498
which you also desperately
need. It's, like,

34:41.500 --> 34:43.467
creepily homogenous in this place.

34:43.469 --> 34:44.996
But I also mean, like,

34:45.021 --> 34:48.339
people who have good,
out-of-the-box ideas.

34:48.341 --> 34:50.152
I want to go where I'm needed.

34:50.178 --> 34:53.393
I actually love the
Home Bases, like, a lot,

34:53.396 --> 34:55.813
and I want to make them all better.

34:55.815 --> 34:58.015
Like, from top to bottom, not just

34:58.017 --> 34:59.474
in one area.

34:59.499 --> 35:02.987
So... I'd like to be transferred

35:02.989 --> 35:04.989
to the store management trainee program

35:04.991 --> 35:08.099
where I can start to
manage stores on site.

35:08.527 --> 35:10.444
We don't have that program.

35:11.401 --> 35:13.664
But we should.

35:13.666 --> 35:16.011
I make a motion to start one.

35:16.335 --> 35:18.202
You can just do that?

35:18.370 --> 35:20.537
Of course. I just need
someone to second it.

35:20.539 --> 35:23.841
- Second it. And third.
- (member chuckles)

35:23.843 --> 35:25.592
What a board meeting.

35:25.594 --> 35:28.262
I might make love to my wife tonight.

35:28.264 --> 35:29.346
Lucky woman.

35:29.348 --> 35:30.681
Yeah. She's really lucky.

35:30.683 --> 35:33.183
- Sure is.
- (sighs): Wow.

35:35.264 --> 35:36.720
HEATHER: So, now,

35:36.722 --> 35:39.303
at long last, I know who I am.

35:39.496 --> 35:41.446
I'm not a student.

35:41.495 --> 35:43.495
I'm a regional manager.

35:43.913 --> 35:45.312
I get to boss people around

35:45.314 --> 35:47.948
at three San Gabriel Valley Home Bases.

35:47.950 --> 35:49.950
- Wow. (chuckles)
- (chuckles) Yeah.

35:49.952 --> 35:51.235
Of course, the West Covina Home Base

35:51.237 --> 35:52.702
will be my home base Home Base.

35:52.727 --> 35:55.456
So you're basically Kevin's boss now?

35:55.458 --> 35:56.907
(chuckles): Yeah.

35:56.909 --> 35:58.749
Yeah. That's weird.

35:59.593 --> 36:01.578
God, I just feel like...

36:01.580 --> 36:04.715
everything's come together in
this cool and unexpected way.

36:04.717 --> 36:07.521
And so now...

36:08.052 --> 36:10.254
I don't know... I feel
ready to take our thing

36:10.256 --> 36:11.685
to the next level, too.

36:12.685 --> 36:13.841
Really?

36:13.843 --> 36:15.976
Yeah. I was thinking

36:15.978 --> 36:19.193
maybe you could... move in?

36:19.756 --> 36:21.565
But I know you're happy here

36:21.567 --> 36:23.934
being besties with your mom.

36:23.936 --> 36:25.402
(laughing) I can't believe
this thing's, like, a large.

36:25.404 --> 36:26.570
But it looks so good.

36:26.572 --> 36:28.655
I'm so happy to do
that for you. No. I...

36:28.657 --> 36:29.773
- So sweet of you.
- Aw.

36:29.775 --> 36:31.408
We're gonna go see Metallica.

36:31.410 --> 36:33.444
- Uh, we might be home late.
- Mm.

36:33.714 --> 36:36.280
- S... Bye.
- Bye!

36:36.282 --> 36:38.749
- (chuckles) I'm so excited.
- JOSH: I know. Bye.

36:38.751 --> 36:40.951
- (door shuts)
- Yeah, about my mom...

36:40.953 --> 36:43.754
(sighs) For the last
few days, I've seen Josh

36:43.756 --> 36:45.456
become her best friend, and...

36:45.458 --> 36:47.424
it's not a good look for him.

36:47.426 --> 36:48.780
Or me.

36:49.788 --> 36:51.553
It's time for me to move out.

36:51.964 --> 36:54.217
Good job, baby.

37:02.796 --> 37:05.180
KEVIN: Welcome home, Regional Manager.

37:05.182 --> 37:07.716
I was so happy when I
heard the news, I went out

37:07.718 --> 37:09.734
- and got you a little present.
- What?

37:09.736 --> 37:11.436
Kevin, you didn't have
to get me anything.

37:11.438 --> 37:12.520
Yes, I did.

37:12.522 --> 37:15.340
When last we spoke, I
was being insensitive.

37:15.342 --> 37:18.310
Since then, I've gone through
extensive online training

37:18.312 --> 37:19.694
in racial sensitivity.

37:19.696 --> 37:21.780
- What?
- I got you this gift

37:21.782 --> 37:23.198
to say congrats on the new job

37:23.479 --> 37:25.283
and also to say

37:25.285 --> 37:27.776
I'm... "sari."

37:28.071 --> 37:30.071
Kevin, I'm not Indian.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.823
I get that a lot, but...

37:31.825 --> 37:33.742
my mom's white, my dad's black.

37:33.744 --> 37:35.911
That's what I am. I'm
half-black, half-white.

37:35.913 --> 37:37.495
100% Michigan.

37:37.497 --> 37:39.464
No. What have I done?

37:39.466 --> 37:41.750
I don't know, but even if I were Indian,

37:41.752 --> 37:44.386
like, not the right move at all here.

37:44.388 --> 37:46.137
I'm so ashamed!

37:46.139 --> 37:47.505
And so hot!

37:47.507 --> 37:49.808
- No... Oh, it's happening.
- (grunting)

37:49.810 --> 37:51.977
- Okay, no. Uh...
- (panting, sniffs)

37:51.979 --> 37:53.178
(exhales)

37:53.920 --> 37:56.051
Oh. Your new rule

37:56.076 --> 37:58.683
about mandated
undershirts is a good idea.

37:58.685 --> 38:00.485
(sighs)

38:01.481 --> 38:03.481
_

38:03.506 --> 38:04.906
(Darryl sighs)

38:04.908 --> 38:07.242
Any minute, they're
gonna call and tell us

38:07.244 --> 38:09.244
how the surrogate implantation is going.

38:10.045 --> 38:11.696
Oh, my God. Can you imagine,
carrying someone else's baby?

38:11.698 --> 38:12.948
What an angel. It's
amazing. I know. I can't...

38:12.950 --> 38:15.000
- (phone ringing)
- Oh! Oh. Oh! Oh!

38:15.002 --> 38:16.368
- (mutters)
- (beeps)

38:16.370 --> 38:17.369
Hello?

38:17.371 --> 38:19.654
Yes, this is Darryl Whitefeather.

38:21.162 --> 38:24.376
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

38:24.378 --> 38:25.631
What? Hey, what's happening?
What's wrong?

38:25.656 --> 38:26.795
Mm, mm, mm.

38:26.797 --> 38:28.680
Yes.

38:28.947 --> 38:31.615
No, thank you. I und... I understand.

38:33.804 --> 38:36.604
The doctor was gonna put
our embryo in the surrogate,

38:36.606 --> 38:39.891
and he realized that
she was already pregnant

38:39.893 --> 38:41.059
- and she didn't know.
- What?

38:41.061 --> 38:42.978
(sighs) Oh, God.

38:42.980 --> 38:44.980
I'm gonna have to find a
surrogate in the next 24 hours

38:44.982 --> 38:46.481
or they're gonna freeze the embryo,

38:46.483 --> 38:48.867
which makes it way less viable.

38:49.111 --> 38:50.894
I'll do it.

38:51.455 --> 38:53.405
- Wait, what did she just say?
- Sorry,

38:53.407 --> 38:55.407
hey, Heather? Can you... can you come...

38:55.409 --> 38:57.075
can you come back here for a second?

38:57.077 --> 38:59.294
What w... What did...
what-what did you say?

38:59.296 --> 39:00.745
Oh.

39:00.747 --> 39:02.580
Yeah, I'm feeling good about my future.

39:02.582 --> 39:03.798
I can do a quick favor.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.383
It's still just nine months, right?

39:05.385 --> 39:07.502
They haven't changed that, have they?

39:07.504 --> 39:08.636
'Cause you know I love my hobbies.

39:08.638 --> 39:12.590
Did you just say that
you would carry our baby?

39:12.592 --> 39:14.142
Yeah, it's fine.

39:14.144 --> 39:15.593
- Oh, my God. Heather.
- (laughing)

39:15.595 --> 39:18.596
- Okay. Moved in my beanbag chair.
- (chuckles)

39:18.598 --> 39:20.265
What-What's happening?

39:20.267 --> 39:22.934
Oh. The three of us are just
gonna have a baby together.

39:22.936 --> 39:24.402
It's no big deal.

39:24.404 --> 39:26.855
Cool. Cool.

39:26.857 --> 39:27.989
What?

39:27.991 --> 39:31.109
- Heather! Oh, my God!
- (laughs) Yay!

39:31.134 --> 39:32.934
(insects trilling)

39:42.158 --> 39:43.755
Hey. Um...

39:44.165 --> 39:46.298
I've been thinking about how I've acted

39:46.323 --> 39:48.960
over the past couple weeks, and, um...

39:49.228 --> 39:50.628
now that I'm off the hormones,

39:50.630 --> 39:53.681
I realize that my behavior has been,

39:53.683 --> 39:55.717
shall we say, heightened.

39:56.743 --> 39:58.923
So, I, uh...

40:00.415 --> 40:01.973
I apologize.

40:03.142 --> 40:04.692
I know I wasn't the nicest person

40:04.694 --> 40:07.033
when you asked for your job back.

40:07.772 --> 40:10.158
And the Raging Waters thing...

40:12.595 --> 40:14.402
I was trying to get under your skin.

40:14.404 --> 40:15.987
- (chuckles)
- I'm sorry.

40:15.989 --> 40:17.655
Honestly, we went in
there for ten minutes,

40:17.657 --> 40:19.040
took a picture, and left.

40:19.042 --> 40:22.072
You know I can't stand
direct sunlight and people.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.379
(chuckling): Right. Right.

40:25.465 --> 40:26.831
Nathaniel, I know that you think

40:26.833 --> 40:28.228
that I ditched you,

40:29.595 --> 40:31.275
but I really am just...

40:31.300 --> 40:34.301
I'm not ready to be in a
real relationship right now.

40:37.806 --> 40:39.144
I really care about you.

40:39.146 --> 40:40.478
I hope you know that.

40:41.259 --> 40:43.181
And breaking things off with you was,

40:43.183 --> 40:45.600
honestly, one of the hardest
things I've ever done.

40:47.751 --> 40:48.770
Wow.

40:48.772 --> 40:50.009
Yeah.

40:50.490 --> 40:51.606
Okay.

40:52.155 --> 40:53.955
And, um...

40:55.439 --> 40:57.853
I'm happy that you found someone else.

40:59.533 --> 41:02.062
- Mona seems lovely.
- Yeah.

41:02.502 --> 41:03.884
Yeah, she really is.

41:03.909 --> 41:06.421
Great. So I'm glad that
we can just be adults now.

41:06.423 --> 41:08.373
- Yes, exactly.
- Okay, good.

41:08.759 --> 41:10.361
Um...

41:10.962 --> 41:12.377
Uh... Ah.

41:12.379 --> 41:14.179
- Friends? Friends.
- (chuckles)

41:14.181 --> 41:15.681
Yeah. (chuckles)

41:16.266 --> 41:18.433
(both chuckle)

41:21.221 --> 41:23.438
(moaning)

41:26.651 --> 41:28.193
This is a terrible idea.

41:28.195 --> 41:31.120
This is the worst idea.
This is the worst idea.

41:33.295 --> 41:35.659
(moaning)
