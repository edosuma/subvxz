WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:02.267
<i> Previously on</i> Reign...
(Bash gasps)

00:02.269 --> 00:05.304
You have magic in you.

00:05.306 --> 00:07.072
Trust no one.

00:07.074 --> 00:09.775
Especially not the likes
of Martel de Guise.

00:09.777 --> 00:11.410
If I'd have known
you were a Guise,

00:11.412 --> 00:13.345
I would have never let you
take me to bed that night.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.215
Should we halt our military
advances in Scotland?

00:16.217 --> 00:17.549
I don't think that's wise.

00:17.551 --> 00:18.617
But Mary's alive.

00:18.619 --> 00:19.718
We don't know that for sure.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.353
Several Scottish lords

00:21.355 --> 00:22.421
have already agreed to back me

00:22.423 --> 00:23.655
as their ruler.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.557
We received word from Edinburgh.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.259
What does Mary ask of you?

00:27.261 --> 00:28.660
To kill Queen Elizabeth.

00:28.662 --> 00:30.229
CATHERINE:
This is your fault.

00:30.231 --> 00:33.465
Following after Charles
on some misguided plot

00:33.467 --> 00:34.767
to take down the Red Knights,

00:34.769 --> 00:37.336
and lose the king of France.

00:37.338 --> 00:39.371
You were right
about the Red Knights.

00:39.373 --> 00:40.856
We have to escape.

00:40.857 --> 00:42.340
PAGE:
Your lordships. John Knox.

00:42.343 --> 00:45.244
Don't pretend you care
that my sister is dead.

00:45.246 --> 00:46.645
James, you and I
and the other lords

00:46.647 --> 00:48.180
can rule Scotland together

00:48.182 --> 00:49.648
as a Protestant government.

00:49.650 --> 00:51.250
Call a meeting tomorrow

00:51.252 --> 00:52.451
and dissolve the throne.

00:52.453 --> 00:54.486
JAMES:
Mary, you're alive.

00:54.488 --> 00:57.589
I am Mary, Queen of Scots,
and I have come for my throne.

01:02.530 --> 01:05.297
<i>I am a stranger in my own home.</i>

01:05.299 --> 01:06.432
My own land.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.635
Scotland is a feudal place
in many ways.

01:11.272 --> 01:13.238
People look to their regional
nobles for leadership

01:13.240 --> 01:14.740
more than their monarch
or regent.

01:14.742 --> 01:17.409
And the nobles, they bow

01:17.411 --> 01:19.545
to a select few who
have risen to prominence.

01:19.547 --> 01:22.347
Your Protestant friends,

01:22.349 --> 01:24.400
the Lords of the Congregation.

01:24.401 --> 01:26.452
BASH: What do you make of
this threat from England?

01:26.454 --> 01:29.288
I trust the intelligence
we've received,

01:29.290 --> 01:31.423
that Elizabeth means
to unite the two countries.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.859
She means to take mine.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.461
And where do
the nobles stand?

01:35.463 --> 01:37.763
JAMES:
None will speak openly.

01:37.765 --> 01:39.398
But, as many follow John Knox,

01:39.400 --> 01:41.100
I would listen carefully
to what he preaches.

01:41.102 --> 01:43.535
He states he would rather be
ruled by a Protestant

01:43.537 --> 01:45.437
from afar than
a Catholic at home.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.272
A Protestant woman, no less.

01:47.274 --> 01:49.241
Yes, it's saying something
that he would support her,

01:49.243 --> 01:50.876
given his hatred of all women.

01:50.878 --> 01:51.877
What is his issue?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.479
They disgust him.

01:53.481 --> 01:54.880
Now, I've never met his mother,
but my guess is,

01:54.882 --> 01:55.881
it starts there.

01:55.883 --> 01:56.782
(scoffs)

01:56.784 --> 01:58.617
Mary,

01:58.619 --> 02:01.820
he's a master orator
and people listen to him.

02:01.822 --> 02:04.990
You-you can't
attack him directly

02:04.991 --> 02:08.159
or arrest him without seeming
to crush the Protestant faith.

02:08.162 --> 02:09.528
You would, however,

02:09.530 --> 02:11.630
beat Elizabeth at her own game

02:11.632 --> 02:15.834
and appease Knox
if you do as he's asked.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.469
Convert to the religion
of the land.

02:17.471 --> 02:18.737
He didn't ask,

02:18.739 --> 02:20.339
he demanded

02:20.341 --> 02:22.374
and then ordered me
to step down from my throne

02:22.376 --> 02:23.408
if I didn't obey.

02:23.410 --> 02:25.377
Where are you going?

02:25.379 --> 02:27.529
To show John Knox

02:27.530 --> 02:29.680
that queens do not bow
to their subjects.

02:29.683 --> 02:32.184
It is, in fact,
quite the other way around.

02:36.290 --> 02:39.358
¶ ¶

02:39.360 --> 02:41.193
(horses neighing)

02:41.195 --> 02:43.896
GUARD:
Stand up for Her Majesty!

02:43.898 --> 02:46.265
Did they come willingly?

02:46.267 --> 02:47.750
Of course.

02:47.751 --> 02:49.234
They were told it was at the
queen regent's invitation.

02:49.236 --> 02:52.204
Welcome.

02:52.206 --> 02:53.839
Two nights ago,
I dined on onion soup

02:53.841 --> 02:55.507
and the broth was sweet,

02:55.509 --> 02:57.576
having none of the bite
common to that vegetable.

02:57.578 --> 02:59.878
When I learned that
the morsels were grown

02:59.880 --> 03:04.716
in your town of Vouvant, I
wanted to thank you personally.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.687
What's the real meaning of this?

03:08.689 --> 03:10.622
I interrogated
the captured Red Knight

03:10.624 --> 03:12.524
and he refuses to speak.

03:12.526 --> 03:13.926
If I'm to glean any information

03:13.928 --> 03:16.461
on Charles' whereabouts,

03:16.463 --> 03:18.530
I'm going to have to
change my strategy.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.966
You will take over
the questioning.

03:20.968 --> 03:23.435
And if he still won't talk?

03:23.437 --> 03:25.337
The prisoner knows
these individuals,

03:25.339 --> 03:27.506
and if he still refuses

03:27.508 --> 03:28.874
to answer your questions,

03:28.876 --> 03:31.577
he can watch while the torturer
chops off their fingers.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.781
Francis was a good king.

03:35.783 --> 03:38.684
He and his nation,
followers of the true faith.

03:38.686 --> 03:41.320
And I'm glad to see
you are as well.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.988
I am in mourning
in God's house only.

03:42.990 --> 03:46.458
Otherwise I am
moving forward with my life.

03:46.460 --> 03:47.893
And I would like
to take Scotland

03:47.895 --> 03:49.494
into the future as well.

03:49.496 --> 03:50.562
Bishop Hamilton.

03:56.503 --> 03:57.803
Could you not
do this in private?

03:57.805 --> 04:01.540
In your own chambers...

04:01.542 --> 04:04.376
Reverend Knox.
Your Majesty.

04:04.378 --> 04:06.912
If your intention is to take
Mass, I must remind you

04:06.914 --> 04:09.514
that it is forbidden by the
Lords of the Congregation.

04:09.516 --> 04:10.849
But I am your queen.

04:10.851 --> 04:12.684
I have returned
and I will practice

04:12.686 --> 04:15.454
my faith.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.289
But you can tell the nobles
who alerted you to my activities

04:17.291 --> 04:19.591
this afternoon
that I have no desire

04:19.593 --> 04:21.460
to impose my religion
on anyone else

04:21.462 --> 04:24.696
or to impede
the worship of theirs.

04:24.698 --> 04:26.298
We can live together in peace.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.599
Scots united.

04:27.601 --> 04:30.969
Or do you not stand with us?

04:30.971 --> 04:32.471
Do you stand with Elizabeth,

04:32.473 --> 04:34.539
who plans to absorb Scotland,

04:34.541 --> 04:35.741
to erase its very existence?

04:35.743 --> 04:37.042
It will never happen.

04:37.044 --> 04:38.477
JAMES:
How can you be so dismissive?

04:38.479 --> 04:40.579
Our intelligence
has been vetted.

04:40.581 --> 04:42.481
Elizabeth is planning
some sort of aggression.

04:42.483 --> 04:44.716
Women say such things
in anger for effect.

04:46.820 --> 04:48.387
For attention.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.492
You, your faith, and the Vatican
are the real threat to peace.

04:53.494 --> 04:58.363
I have returned home to lead
this country to greatness.

04:58.365 --> 05:00.999
Help me bring all
of my people together,

05:01.001 --> 05:02.801
or may God

05:02.803 --> 05:05.604
and your queen
have mercy on your soul.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.884
(mouthing)

05:20.721 --> 05:22.587
(knocking on door)

05:24.992 --> 05:27.592
(sighs)
Your son is fine.

05:27.594 --> 05:29.728
Sleeping like a lamb.
(sighs)

05:29.730 --> 05:32.597
I'm more worried about you.

05:32.599 --> 05:35.334
I have read this letter
over and over,

05:35.336 --> 05:37.436
praying I'm misinterpreting
Mary's code.

05:37.438 --> 05:39.371
Asking you to slay her rival.

05:41.108 --> 05:43.642
Elizabeth plans
to take Scotland,

05:43.644 --> 05:47.346
and once she does, she cannot
allow Mary to survive.

05:47.348 --> 05:50.782
But, Lady Lola,
you are a mother, a wife,

05:50.784 --> 05:52.417
not an assassin.

05:52.419 --> 05:56.855
In two days there is a summit
of Elizabeth's advisors.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.357
The event will allow

05:58.359 --> 06:01.026
Mary's agent to blend in
and then strike.

06:01.028 --> 06:02.561
All the assassin needs

06:02.563 --> 06:03.929
is someone on the inside,

06:03.931 --> 06:05.530
someone that Elizabeth
can trust.

06:05.532 --> 06:07.032
If you're caught...

06:07.034 --> 06:08.700
Mary has sent coin enough
to plan my escape,

06:08.702 --> 06:11.370
but I won't risk John's life.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.838
Arrange another meeting
with my husband.

06:12.840 --> 06:14.539
My queen,

06:14.541 --> 06:16.975
my friend needs me.

06:18.912 --> 06:20.746
Elizabeth must die.

06:31.125 --> 06:32.824
JAMES:
I know you were planning
on holding court,

06:32.826 --> 06:34.726
but I wouldn't just yet.

06:34.728 --> 06:35.861
What is it?
What's happened?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.396
There was a slaughter
of Protestants

06:37.398 --> 06:38.797
in a small village
near St. Andrews.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.432
Houses burned,

06:40.434 --> 06:43.435
mothers and fathers gutted
in front of their children.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.870
The few Catholics
who were left fled.

06:44.872 --> 06:45.904
We must find them.
They're probably

06:45.906 --> 06:47.072
halfway to Ireland by now.

06:47.074 --> 06:49.441
They did round up
the village priest

06:49.443 --> 06:51.042
who seems to have
incited the violence.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.444
BASH:
Mary.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.613
I was meeting with
your military leaders

06:54.615 --> 06:56.615
when news came in that a group
of Englishmen have been sighted

06:56.617 --> 06:57.883
traveling from town to town.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.886
A delegation of noblemen
sent by Elizabeth.

07:00.888 --> 07:02.587
They seem to be meeting
with various lords

07:02.589 --> 07:03.955
who hold sway in their regions,

07:03.957 --> 07:05.791
particularly Protestants.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.993
She's trying to turn them.

07:07.995 --> 07:10.162
Seeing who's willing to ally
themselves with her against me.

07:10.164 --> 07:12.130
JAMES: The timing of this
could not be worse.

07:12.132 --> 07:13.765
Coming on the heels of
the Catholic slaughter

07:13.767 --> 07:14.800
of Protestants.

07:14.802 --> 07:16.468
Bring me this Catholic priest.

07:16.470 --> 07:17.936
If he is guilty, he will hang.

07:17.938 --> 07:20.439
Now you and I are going to go

07:20.441 --> 07:21.973
and meet these English nobles
and tell them that

07:21.975 --> 07:23.942
Scotland is not for sale.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.611
I will assemble a team
of queensguard to accompany us.

07:31.885 --> 07:34.186
BASH:
I thought I recognized you.

07:34.188 --> 07:36.655
You were among the Druids
attacked by Clan Macfie.

07:36.657 --> 07:38.657
Your wounds were grave, and yet,

07:38.659 --> 07:40.792
your neck,
there's not a mark on you.

07:40.794 --> 07:42.027
I remember you, too.

07:42.029 --> 07:44.129
Touched by magic you are.

07:44.131 --> 07:45.864
You don't belong here.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.666
You can't protect her.

07:47.668 --> 07:48.900
Mary, you mean.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.469
You're not doing
all that you can do.

07:50.471 --> 07:52.938
All that you're capable of.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.474
Bash?

07:55.476 --> 07:56.875
I'm sorry.

07:56.877 --> 07:58.009
A moment.

08:07.020 --> 08:09.654
(indistinct conversations)

08:13.560 --> 08:14.826
Lord Dudley.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.595
Thank you for
making the journey.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.730
I think I speak for
the entire council when I say

08:18.732 --> 08:19.965
the potential acquisition
of Scotland

08:19.967 --> 08:21.733
is an exciting prospect.

08:21.735 --> 08:24.569
But I need to speak
with you in private.

08:24.571 --> 08:27.639
Not now-- my attentions
are needed here.

08:29.776 --> 08:31.243
Get word to our spies
in Scottish court

08:31.245 --> 08:35.914
that our delegation
is heading to Edinburgh.

08:35.916 --> 08:37.549
NARCISSE:
Is that all you brought?

08:37.551 --> 08:38.550
(baby cooing)

08:38.552 --> 08:40.018
Stephan, I can't go with you.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.254
What?

08:42.256 --> 08:44.256
(Baby John fusses)

08:44.258 --> 08:46.658
You said we would
get on Gideon's boat

08:46.660 --> 08:48.827
and we would never look back.

08:48.829 --> 08:50.896
So what's changed?
There's an event

08:50.898 --> 08:52.898
Elizabeth wants me here for.
An event?

08:52.900 --> 08:54.165
Some sort of reception
for her advisors.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.835
We had a plan.

08:56.837 --> 08:57.869
And now Elizabeth
is back at court,

08:57.871 --> 08:59.671
she'll be watching
your every move.

08:59.673 --> 09:01.907
To leave, you need money,
coin to bribe them...

09:01.909 --> 09:03.008
It's been taken care of.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.109
Go.

09:04.111 --> 09:05.577
Take John with you.

09:05.579 --> 09:07.045
There's an inn in London--

09:07.047 --> 09:09.548
The Anchor-- I'll meet you
both there in two days.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.216
Wha-- two days?

09:11.218 --> 09:12.751
Why can't you leave now?

09:12.753 --> 09:16.688
(sighs)
This marriage...

09:17.858 --> 09:19.724
...it's been a challenge
like no other.

09:21.028 --> 09:25.864
I feel like I was a child
before I knew you.

09:25.866 --> 09:29.234
I was able to judge you
and the things you did

09:29.236 --> 09:32.771
because I never understood the
darkest truths of this world.

09:32.773 --> 09:35.106
I don't want you

09:35.108 --> 09:36.775
to dwell in darkness.

09:36.777 --> 09:38.843
I want to protect you from it.

09:38.845 --> 09:41.613
I know.

09:41.615 --> 09:43.014
And I love you.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.695
Oh, please go,

09:56.697 --> 09:58.630
while I still have
the courage to say good-bye.

09:58.632 --> 10:01.933
What do you mean "good-bye"?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.769
(Baby John coos)

10:04.771 --> 10:05.870
For now.

10:07.841 --> 10:12.844
I'm your wife again, Stephan.

10:12.846 --> 10:14.012
We're a family.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.722
BABY JOHN:
Mama.

10:23.724 --> 10:26.057
Please take care of him.

10:30.631 --> 10:33.632
(indistinct conversation)

10:33.634 --> 10:35.734
My private soldiers

10:35.736 --> 10:37.202
visited each of the nobles

10:37.204 --> 10:39.004
who are providing safe haven
to the royal children.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.839
Here are their reports.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.007
Good afternoon, Princess.

10:42.009 --> 10:44.843
Tell me first, how is Henry?

10:44.845 --> 10:46.111
He's quite homesick

10:46.113 --> 10:47.646
in Orleans.

10:47.648 --> 10:49.648
Well, he may get his wish
to return soon enough,

10:49.650 --> 10:50.849
oblivious to the fact

10:50.851 --> 10:52.651
that he may already be king.

10:52.653 --> 10:53.652
If Charles is...

10:53.654 --> 10:54.853
Queen Regent,

10:54.854 --> 10:56.053
rumors are afoot that
the Red Knights are mounting

10:56.056 --> 10:57.322
an assault on the castle.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.124
We are to escort you
and the princess

10:59.126 --> 11:00.925
to your chambers until
the privy council can gather.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.661
Put your men on notice,

11:02.663 --> 11:03.995
I may need their services.

11:05.132 --> 11:07.799
(man groans, people shouting)

11:07.801 --> 11:08.933
(groans)

11:10.771 --> 11:12.370
No! Wait, Martel,
he's one of us!

11:12.372 --> 11:14.873
CATHERINE:
What is happening?

11:14.875 --> 11:18.009
Your interrogation methods
paid off.

11:18.011 --> 11:19.744
Our prisoner gave up the names
of the last Red Knights

11:19.746 --> 11:20.979
to infiltrate the kingsguard.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.914
Here they are.

11:22.916 --> 11:24.315
They were going to kill us.

11:24.317 --> 11:27.085
You saved our lives.

11:27.087 --> 11:28.386
Leith Bayard.

11:28.388 --> 11:30.121
It's a good thing
you moved when you did.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.890
Duke Martel de Guise.

11:31.892 --> 11:34.759
Yes, you're quite a hero.

11:34.761 --> 11:35.994
Is there word of the king?

11:35.996 --> 11:37.079
I believe

11:37.080 --> 11:38.163
the captive
genuinely didn't know

11:38.165 --> 11:39.297
where King Charles
was being hidden.

11:39.299 --> 11:41.466
Is Charles already slain?

11:41.468 --> 11:43.001
O-Or he escaped

11:43.003 --> 11:44.436
and the Red Knights
are scrambling.

11:44.438 --> 11:46.838
CATHERINE: Well, that is a hope
I shall cling to.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.408
Leith, protect my daughter.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.444
Cling to each other.

11:52.446 --> 11:54.879
May you have
a long and happy life.

11:54.881 --> 11:58.049
I give you my blessing to wed.

12:03.023 --> 12:04.322
I love you.

12:04.324 --> 12:07.158
God, I love you.

12:13.066 --> 12:15.734
Bash, you've been quiet
this journey.

12:15.736 --> 12:16.968
Is something troubling you?

12:16.970 --> 12:18.453
You needn't worry about me.

12:18.454 --> 12:19.937
But I do.
It was my choice to come here

12:19.940 --> 12:22.874
to serve you, to protect
you, and I will.

12:22.876 --> 12:24.342
You're not responsible for me
or my happiness.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.351
So, my maids' gossip is true.

12:33.353 --> 12:34.753
And I thought Melaniee
came along

12:34.755 --> 12:36.387
because she could cook.
She did.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.056
And she can tell
a great joke as well.

12:39.826 --> 12:43.128
(indistinct conversations)

12:43.130 --> 12:45.196
(animal bleating)

12:53.006 --> 12:54.072
That's them.

12:54.074 --> 12:57.108
The English, plain as day.

12:57.110 --> 12:59.778
You there.

12:59.780 --> 13:01.980
I am Mary, Queen of Scots.

13:01.982 --> 13:04.115
I want to talk to
the leader of your delegation.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.519
Gideon.

13:11.191 --> 13:12.423
Your Majesty.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.046
We can't do this.

13:35.048 --> 13:36.514
You're right.

13:36.516 --> 13:39.384
Our hosts or their servants
could come in at any moment.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.052
No, I mean that we can't do this

13:41.054 --> 13:42.353
if we are enemies.

13:42.355 --> 13:43.822
Are we, Gideon?

13:43.824 --> 13:46.825
I am here in service
of my queen.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.393
Can you share anything with me?

13:48.395 --> 13:50.061
They say your delegation

13:50.063 --> 13:52.530
is making progress
with my nation's Protestants.

13:52.532 --> 13:54.532
Which ones and
how powerful are they?

13:54.534 --> 13:57.468
Mary, it's worse than that.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.838
We've also made headway
with Catholic nobles.

14:02.108 --> 14:05.043
Elizabeth is proposing

14:05.045 --> 14:07.111
a bloodless coup after so much
blood has been spilt.

14:07.113 --> 14:09.881
You can understand

14:09.883 --> 14:12.250
that the known is, is more
appealing than the unknown.

14:12.252 --> 14:13.484
Your people are so tired

14:13.486 --> 14:15.620
of foreigners, of fighting.

14:15.622 --> 14:19.524
Fighting and unrest incited
by England for centuries.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.159
And now
I'm the potential tyrant?

14:21.161 --> 14:24.028
I'm the one to fear?

14:24.030 --> 14:25.563
Gideon, I need time.

14:25.564 --> 14:27.097
It will take years
for your people to trust you.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.366
Days.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.335
Something has happened
and I need to fix it

14:30.337 --> 14:33.037
to show my Protestant nobles
that I am Scotland's queen

14:33.039 --> 14:34.339
and not a Catholic despot.

14:34.341 --> 14:38.176
You are moving north
towards my most powerful lords.

14:38.178 --> 14:39.510
The Lords of the Congregation,

14:39.512 --> 14:40.945
if they turn to Elizabeth...

14:40.947 --> 14:43.248
Then I am finished.

14:43.250 --> 14:46.117
If you truly care for me,
you will delay your travels.

14:46.119 --> 14:48.219
I'm not here alone.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.487
My choices will be noted.

14:49.489 --> 14:50.922
One day.

14:50.924 --> 14:52.190
Just stall.

14:52.192 --> 14:54.225
Somehow, please.

14:54.227 --> 14:57.228
All right.

14:57.230 --> 14:58.329
I'll do it.

15:02.602 --> 15:06.037
(bell tolling in distance)

15:09.276 --> 15:10.942
(trumpet blows)

15:16.283 --> 15:18.283
Oh, my son.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.418
You have returned to me.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.021
Oh, the king is alive!
Long live the king!

15:23.023 --> 15:24.289
GUARDS:
Long live the king!

15:24.291 --> 15:25.323
And Thierry is dead.

15:25.325 --> 15:27.292
I can't, I can't do it.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.660
I don't want it.

15:28.662 --> 15:30.295
You don't want what?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.363
To be king.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.472
God save Mary,
Queen of Scots.

15:41.474 --> 15:42.707
God save her.

15:42.709 --> 15:44.075
And you are?

15:44.077 --> 15:47.011
Better you don't know.

15:47.013 --> 15:49.380
There's a mechanical clock
in the corridor

15:49.382 --> 15:51.015
leading to the Great Hall.

15:51.017 --> 15:52.684
Hide the pistol inside
and I'll retrieve it

15:52.686 --> 15:54.218
when the time is right.

15:54.220 --> 15:57.021
The pistol requires close
range to be effective.

15:57.023 --> 15:58.156
I'll need you to stall Elizabeth

15:58.158 --> 15:59.390
as she makes her way
to the library.

15:59.392 --> 16:02.060
You'll get your shot.

16:02.062 --> 16:04.429
But how do you have any hope
of escaping with your life?

16:04.431 --> 16:06.264
I don't.

16:06.266 --> 16:11.002
I shall die in the service of
Queen Mary and the true faith.

16:11.004 --> 16:13.037
Until tomorrow.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.712
Information has come from our
spies that the Red Knights

16:20.714 --> 16:23.014
are hiding in one of three
potential towns.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.983
What does that
have to do with you?

16:24.985 --> 16:27.251
I have been assigned the
mountain village of La Clusaz,

16:27.253 --> 16:29.020
where I will question the locals

16:29.022 --> 16:30.722
and help track down
the last of these betrayers.

16:30.724 --> 16:33.992
You can stop trying to prove
yourself to my family.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.593
Charles is out of danger

16:35.595 --> 16:37.628
and my mother has
given us her blessing.

16:37.630 --> 16:42.033
But none of that matters unless
I can keep the Valois safe.

16:42.035 --> 16:44.002
Most importantly, you.

16:44.004 --> 16:46.637
¶ What if we run away,
what if we left today? ¶

16:46.639 --> 16:47.739
If you go on this mission,

16:47.741 --> 16:49.474
I'll stop loving you.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.476
You can do that?
Just like that?

16:51.478 --> 16:54.212
Yes.
Ask anyone.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.780
I'm as fickle as they come.

16:55.782 --> 16:58.016
I suppose that does
change things.

16:58.018 --> 17:01.085
Before, I had reason
to return home

17:01.087 --> 17:02.754
quickly and all in one piece.

17:02.756 --> 17:04.255
For our wedding.

17:04.257 --> 17:06.124
Your mother may have
given her blessing,

17:06.126 --> 17:08.359
but I still must do the asking.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.228
¶ And the stars exploding ¶

17:10.230 --> 17:13.264
Claude...

17:13.266 --> 17:14.599
will you marry me?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.067
¶ My youth ¶

17:16.069 --> 17:17.769
¶ My youth is yours ¶
Yes!

17:17.771 --> 17:20.605
Yes, yes, yes!

17:20.607 --> 17:22.607
¶ My youth is yours ¶

17:22.609 --> 17:24.275
¶ Run away now and forever ¶

17:24.277 --> 17:25.543
¶ My youth ¶

17:25.545 --> 17:26.778
¶ My youth is yours ¶

17:26.780 --> 17:28.046
¶ The truth's so loud ¶

17:28.048 --> 17:29.280
¶ You can't ignore ¶

17:29.282 --> 17:31.249
¶ My youth ¶

17:31.251 --> 17:33.718
¶ My youth, my youth ¶

17:33.720 --> 17:35.153
¶ My youth is yours. ¶

17:35.155 --> 17:37.422
(door creaking open)

17:37.424 --> 17:39.057
(chains rattling)

17:39.059 --> 17:41.259
Father Ashby,

17:41.261 --> 17:44.095
you have been brought before us
because you have been accused

17:44.097 --> 17:45.129
of inciting a massacre.

17:45.131 --> 17:46.497
I know what happened,

17:46.499 --> 17:48.499
and I have spoken
against Protestants,

17:48.501 --> 17:50.601
but I have urged Catholics

17:50.603 --> 17:51.836
to use the same tactics

17:51.838 --> 17:53.738
Protestants have
adopted of late:

17:53.740 --> 17:55.173
protest.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.774
Then why are you still blamed?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.509
Because I'm the only one
left standing.

17:58.511 --> 17:59.844
It's a small village.

17:59.846 --> 18:01.646
The Catholics
who lived there fled.

18:01.648 --> 18:03.381
The Catholics who
murdered their neighbors?

18:03.383 --> 18:06.250
I don't even know
if locals from my parish did it,

18:06.252 --> 18:08.319
because I wasn't there.

18:08.321 --> 18:09.754
I'd taken a retreat,

18:09.756 --> 18:11.422
seeking silence and prayer.

18:11.424 --> 18:14.692
Please tell me that this retreat
was at a monastery

18:14.694 --> 18:16.127
where people saw you.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.829
Well, I wanted
to be with nature.

18:17.831 --> 18:19.330
I took shelter

18:19.332 --> 18:21.566
in an abandoned abbey
near Loch Leven.

18:24.270 --> 18:27.705
They say you are clever,

18:27.707 --> 18:29.774
skilled by Catherine de Medici
in the ways of the French.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.442
And what ways are those?

18:31.444 --> 18:33.211
Politically expedient.

18:33.213 --> 18:35.146
Mercenary.

18:35.148 --> 18:37.415
You cannot blame me for
something I didn't do.

18:37.417 --> 18:39.617
God knows the truth,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.853
and if you trade my life
for your gain,

18:41.855 --> 18:44.188
it will forever
mark your soul.

18:44.190 --> 18:45.590
Take him back to the dungeon.

18:50.763 --> 18:52.363
(door creaks shut)

18:52.365 --> 18:53.631
I can't win.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.733
Protestants hate me
because I am Catholic,

18:55.735 --> 18:57.902
and everyone else mistrusts me
because I am French.

18:57.904 --> 19:00.538
What a fearful, angry man.

19:00.540 --> 19:04.509
But there is no proof
that he is to blame.

19:04.511 --> 19:07.645
Mary, you rushed back to court,
ahead of the English contingent,

19:07.647 --> 19:09.347
to win over your
Protestant lords.

19:09.349 --> 19:11.182
If you don't give them justice

19:11.184 --> 19:13.284
for their dead,
they will turn to Elizabeth.

19:13.286 --> 19:15.253
How is murdering him justice?

19:15.255 --> 19:17.188
I can't do it, James.

19:17.190 --> 19:20.491
I can't.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.726
(sighs)

19:21.728 --> 19:24.262
(indistinct conversations)

19:32.205 --> 19:33.304
GUARD:
Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth.

19:36.943 --> 19:38.709
Your Majesty.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.845
As your Scottish advisor,
I-I was hoping to sit in.

19:40.847 --> 19:44.515
The summit is for
official advisors.

19:44.517 --> 19:46.751
It would be best if our
arrangement stayed between us.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.587
Elizabeth?

19:52.225 --> 19:54.258
Lola, is something wrong?

19:54.260 --> 19:56.360
DUDLEY:
Elizabeth!
Look out!

19:57.597 --> 19:59.230
(woman screaming)

19:59.232 --> 20:00.198
Seize the assassin.

20:00.200 --> 20:01.499
Seize Lady Lola as well.

20:01.501 --> 20:02.833
They were working in concert,
I'm sure.

20:02.835 --> 20:05.369
(Elizabeth and Lola panting)

20:05.371 --> 20:06.737
Arrest her.

20:24.390 --> 20:27.325
It seems my would-be assassin
is a Catholic radical.

20:27.327 --> 20:29.293
He confessed the two of you

20:29.295 --> 20:32.230
worked together to plan
the details of my murder.

20:32.232 --> 20:35.700
And it was all by
the order of Mary,

20:35.702 --> 20:37.435
Queen of Scots.

20:40.306 --> 20:41.405
Was that the plan all along?

20:41.407 --> 20:44.308
Oh, no.

20:44.310 --> 20:46.377
You are at war with my country.

20:46.379 --> 20:47.778
I'm not!

20:47.780 --> 20:50.581
I explained that to you
and I meant every word.

20:50.583 --> 20:54.285
This idea of yours,
a bloodless offensive,

20:54.287 --> 20:58.256
it is a delusion you have talked
yourself into when once you knew

20:58.258 --> 21:01.592
there can only be one queen.

21:01.594 --> 21:02.960
And I had to choose mine.

21:02.962 --> 21:04.996
I welcomed you into my court.

21:04.998 --> 21:07.365
I confided in you.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.633
I trusted you.

21:08.635 --> 21:10.835
Oh, you don't trust anyone.

21:10.837 --> 21:12.637
You have more power

21:12.639 --> 21:15.840
than anyone around you,
and people will want it.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.909
And because you value power
above all else,

21:18.911 --> 21:21.979
you will always be alone.

21:23.650 --> 21:27.351
It's incredible, really.

21:27.353 --> 21:31.022
I march to my execution
very soon,

21:31.024 --> 21:34.492
and yet you are the one
to be pitied.

21:41.367 --> 21:43.334
(sighs)

21:43.336 --> 21:44.869
I told the privy council

21:44.871 --> 21:46.504
that you outmaneuvered
the Red Knights

21:46.506 --> 21:48.072
and they loved every word of it.

21:48.074 --> 21:49.540
You're a hero, Charles.

21:49.542 --> 21:51.575
Never has a king
been in such favor.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.344
What do you want from me,
Mother?

21:53.346 --> 21:55.613
(sighs)
You survived.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.415
You are fine.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.084
Am I?

22:00.086 --> 22:02.053
(exhales sharply)

22:02.055 --> 22:03.921
Thierry and I were separated.

22:03.923 --> 22:06.324
(men shouting)

22:06.326 --> 22:07.591
Thierry, no.

22:07.593 --> 22:09.026
The Red Knights caught him.

22:10.596 --> 22:13.364
(grunts)

22:13.366 --> 22:15.666
CHARLES:<i> I watched as my friend</i>
<i> was strung up</i>

22:15.668 --> 22:16.934
<i> like a pig on a spit.</i>

22:16.936 --> 22:18.469
(indistinct shouting echoing)

22:18.471 --> 22:21.706
He could see, hear, and
smell his flesh burn.

22:21.708 --> 22:25.109
<i> As could I from my coward's</i>
<i> hiding place in the treetops.</i>

22:25.111 --> 22:26.977
He screamed for hours

22:26.979 --> 22:30.114
but never gave me up.

22:30.116 --> 22:33.617
He sacrificed himself
so you could live.

22:33.619 --> 22:36.387
He knew the value
of a king's life.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.489
I told you, I don't
want to be king.

22:38.491 --> 22:40.424
This isn't a job
you get to choose,

22:40.426 --> 22:41.892
and you can't just
walk away from it.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.395
Where are you going?
To tell the council my decision.

22:44.397 --> 22:47.131
You have a responsibility to
this nation and to your family.

22:47.133 --> 22:49.633
No, I don't.
I can't do it.

22:49.635 --> 22:51.569
I feel nothing,
I am nothing!

22:53.373 --> 22:54.739
You never say such things.

22:54.741 --> 22:58.075
You foolish boy,
you need to grow up.

22:58.077 --> 22:59.677
I didn't work this
hard for nothing.

22:59.679 --> 23:02.146
(breathing shakily):
Charles, look at me.

23:02.148 --> 23:04.415
You show your enemies
such weakness,

23:04.417 --> 23:06.150
and they will keep coming.

23:06.152 --> 23:08.486
And this nightmare
will never end.

23:11.457 --> 23:14.458
(door shuts)

23:14.460 --> 23:16.427
Father Ashby is dead? How?

23:16.429 --> 23:17.962
Hanged himself in the night.

23:17.964 --> 23:20.598
A mortal sin,
perhaps his second.

23:20.600 --> 23:21.899
He could have been
lying to you, Mary,

23:21.901 --> 23:24.502
about his role
in the Protestant massacre.

23:24.504 --> 23:27.805
No.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.173
I think the poor man
killed himself

23:29.175 --> 23:30.508
because he thought
I would torture him

23:30.510 --> 23:32.977
until I got the answer I wanted.

23:32.979 --> 23:35.179
Being trained as I am
by Catherine de Medici.

23:36.849 --> 23:38.849
Maybe he was right after all.

23:38.851 --> 23:41.485
As much as it sickens
me to do this...

23:44.957 --> 23:48.459
...whether he was a liar
or a victim,

23:48.461 --> 23:51.529
his death will not be in vain.

23:51.531 --> 23:55.166
MARY: This is
Father Simon Xavier Ashby.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.802
You may see a Catholic priest,

23:57.804 --> 24:00.771
but I see a man guilty

24:00.773 --> 24:03.073
of committing atrocities
against his countrymen,

24:03.075 --> 24:05.676
sentenced to hang by his queen.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.078
I have invited you here

24:08.080 --> 24:11.215
so that you may know
that under my rule,

24:11.217 --> 24:14.218
all men will be judged
not by their faith

24:14.220 --> 24:17.054
but by their actions.

24:17.056 --> 24:19.557
Because, regardless of my faith,

24:19.559 --> 24:21.525
I am not a Catholic queen,

24:21.527 --> 24:23.561
I am not a Protestant queen,

24:23.563 --> 24:25.863
I am not a French queen,

24:25.865 --> 24:27.198
I am<i> your</i> queen.

24:27.200 --> 24:28.566
(all murmuring)

24:28.568 --> 24:30.468
I was born on this soil.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.137
Crowned after the English

24:33.139 --> 24:35.706
murdered my father
when I was six days old.

24:35.708 --> 24:38.976
I was raised to fight
for this nation.

24:42.615 --> 24:44.915
I am Scottish.
(all murmuring in agreement)

24:44.917 --> 24:49.620
This country is in my blood
as I know it is in yours.

24:49.622 --> 24:51.589
I believe in a Scotland
that is independent,

24:51.591 --> 24:53.224
prosperous, and peaceful.

24:53.226 --> 24:55.360
A Scotland that cannot

24:55.361 --> 24:57.495
be frightened, bullied,
or bought by anyone.

24:57.497 --> 24:59.663
If you agree,

24:59.665 --> 25:01.966
then you will stand with me

25:01.968 --> 25:04.001
and tell this English
delegation,

25:04.003 --> 25:06.003
who would urge you
to bow to their queen,

25:06.005 --> 25:09.740
what we have told countless
invaders before them...

25:09.742 --> 25:10.908
(all murmuring in agreement)

25:10.910 --> 25:13.244
...that this is<i> our</i> land.

25:13.246 --> 25:15.579
And that, though they
may spill our blood,

25:15.581 --> 25:17.147
they will never
take the Scotland

25:17.149 --> 25:18.549
that pounds in our veins!

25:18.551 --> 25:21.819
(cheering and applause)

25:23.222 --> 25:24.655
MAN:
Long live the queen!

25:24.657 --> 25:26.290
(people shouting indistinctly)

25:39.539 --> 25:41.939
CATHERINE:
Lord Beljour? Count DuFrey?

25:41.941 --> 25:43.274
Your Grace.
Your Majesty.

25:45.645 --> 25:47.077
Was there an
unannounced meeting?

25:47.079 --> 25:48.579
Mother, come in.

25:48.581 --> 25:52.049
I'm glad to see you back
on your feet, recovered.

25:52.051 --> 25:53.584
Why is the privy council
meeting without me?

25:53.586 --> 25:56.587
It's what you wanted,
me to be king,

25:56.589 --> 25:58.055
And thanks to your
verbal embellishments,

25:58.057 --> 26:01.225
I'm not only king but a hero.

26:01.227 --> 26:02.760
I asked them
to declare me of age.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.828
No.
My request was granted.

26:04.830 --> 26:06.664
Charles, you've made
a terrible mistake.

26:06.666 --> 26:09.166
Which means I no longer
need you as regent.

26:09.168 --> 26:11.001
You can't use your children

26:11.003 --> 26:13.203
as pawns in your schemes
to gain power.

26:13.205 --> 26:14.805
You have no power

26:14.807 --> 26:16.674
'cause I've taken it all away.

26:16.676 --> 26:18.108
You said yourself
you are not well.

26:18.110 --> 26:20.311
The throne is
a dangerous place.

26:20.313 --> 26:21.645
You need experienced guidance.

26:21.647 --> 26:22.947
But not yours.

26:22.949 --> 26:25.049
Do you know...
Now leave.

26:25.051 --> 26:27.685
Not another word,
do you hear me?

26:42.201 --> 26:43.767
Summon my military advisors.

26:50.076 --> 26:51.942
Lady Lola's husband's
arrived at court.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.210
He's insisting
that she's innocent,

26:53.212 --> 26:56.080
demands a chance
to plea for her release.

26:56.082 --> 26:58.048
He is the chancellor of France.

26:58.050 --> 27:03.854
This can't turn into
an international incident.

27:03.856 --> 27:05.689
Summon the executioner.

27:05.691 --> 27:08.959
Lady Lola will lose
her head today.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.261
Tell Chancellor Narcisse

27:11.263 --> 27:13.130
I will extend a diplomatic
courtesy to France

27:13.131 --> 27:14.998
by permitting him to attend
his wife's execution.

27:15.001 --> 27:17.668
I'm sorry, Elizabeth.

27:17.670 --> 27:19.703
I know that you've grown
very fond of her.

27:19.705 --> 27:23.307
I let her get close
because I was lonely.

27:23.309 --> 27:26.844
Lady Lola said I
would always be alone,

27:26.846 --> 27:28.746
but I don't want to be.

27:28.748 --> 27:30.147
Elizabeth...

27:30.149 --> 27:31.715
It has been months

27:31.717 --> 27:33.784
since your wife's death,

27:33.786 --> 27:35.719
and since the assassination
attempt on my life,

27:35.721 --> 27:37.855
the nation's sympathies
will be with me.

27:37.857 --> 27:39.189
Marry me.

27:39.191 --> 27:40.724
Elizabeth, we can't.

27:40.726 --> 27:42.793
This time I won't delay,
I won't pull away.

27:42.795 --> 27:45.329
I don't care if it diminishes
me on the world stage,

27:45.331 --> 27:47.898
I want to share
my power with you.

27:47.900 --> 27:49.833
More than share-- you
will be England's king,

27:49.835 --> 27:51.769
instantly risen
in station above me.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.937
Do you hear yourself, Elizabeth?

27:53.939 --> 27:55.773
This isn't talk of love.
It is.

27:55.775 --> 27:57.074
What is love
if not sacrifice?

27:57.076 --> 27:58.342
Stop, just stop.

27:58.344 --> 27:59.777
I can't marry you

27:59.779 --> 28:00.978
because I'm already
wed to another.

28:03.816 --> 28:08.118
I tried to tell you, but you
wouldn't give me any time.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.854
How could you?

28:10.856 --> 28:13.691
Because you promised me

28:13.693 --> 28:15.259
that it would be years before
we had any possibility,

28:15.261 --> 28:17.161
and I've lost faith.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.329
Who is she?

28:19.331 --> 28:21.331
Lettice Knollys.

28:21.333 --> 28:22.433
(sighs)

28:22.435 --> 28:25.102
It's an advantageous match.

28:25.104 --> 28:27.204
(grunts)

28:27.206 --> 28:29.106
Get out.
Elizabeth...

28:29.108 --> 28:31.709
You are dismissed, Robert.

28:31.711 --> 28:35.412
Leave me and my court.

28:40.019 --> 28:41.752
(door opens)

28:41.754 --> 28:42.820
(panting)

28:42.822 --> 28:44.121
(door shuts)

28:44.123 --> 28:45.789
One of my kingsguard
has confirmed

28:45.791 --> 28:47.958
that the Red Knights
are holed up in a farm

28:47.960 --> 28:49.860
on the outskirts of La Clusaz.

28:49.862 --> 28:50.894
Then you must move quickly.

28:50.896 --> 28:52.496
If you can trust your source.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.465
Leith Bayard has
served my family

28:54.467 --> 28:56.767
loyally for years, Martel.

28:56.769 --> 28:58.302
Now, he recommends an attack
as soon as possible

28:58.304 --> 29:01.205
to prevent the Knights
from fleeing to Switzerland.

29:01.207 --> 29:03.741
But I need extra forces
for the siege.

29:03.743 --> 29:06.076
MARTEL:
Count on my help, Majesty.

29:06.078 --> 29:09.313
My soldiers are expert
on missions like this.

29:09.315 --> 29:10.380
Will your source,

29:10.382 --> 29:12.382
this Leith,
be waiting at La Clusaz?

29:12.384 --> 29:13.484
He will.

29:13.486 --> 29:15.219
France thanks you
for your advice

29:15.221 --> 29:17.254
and assistance.

29:17.256 --> 29:18.756
Your Majesty.
Your Majesty.

29:38.244 --> 29:41.078
¶ Walking in my sleep ¶

29:41.080 --> 29:43.981
¶ Like the naked trees ¶

29:43.983 --> 29:47.017
¶ Will they wake up again? ¶

29:47.019 --> 29:48.285
¶ Do they sleep? ¶

29:48.287 --> 29:51.288
¶ Do they dream? ¶

29:51.290 --> 29:54.424
¶ Feel it as the wind ¶

29:54.426 --> 29:56.860
¶ Strokes my skin ¶

29:56.862 --> 29:59.930
¶ I am moved by the chill... ¶

29:59.932 --> 30:02.166
When will I see you again?

30:02.168 --> 30:05.803
I've already sent word that
my mission technically failed.

30:05.805 --> 30:07.805
Elizabeth might blame me.

30:07.807 --> 30:11.175
Of course, when she hears
of your rousing speech,

30:11.177 --> 30:13.477
she may realize you're
unbeatable by any man.

30:13.479 --> 30:17.447
I used that priest's suicide
for my own gain.

30:17.449 --> 30:18.982
He said it would leave
a mark on my soul.

30:18.984 --> 30:21.218
You did what you had to do.

30:21.219 --> 30:23.453
I was covered in blood before
I even walked into this castle.

30:23.455 --> 30:26.490
You murdered the man
who took Francis from you.

30:26.492 --> 30:29.326
¶ Where the boats
have passed me by ¶

30:29.328 --> 30:30.961
It was just.

30:30.963 --> 30:32.830
You're becoming
a stronger ruler.

30:32.832 --> 30:34.164
It's what Scotland needs.

30:34.166 --> 30:35.399
It's what Elizabeth needs

30:35.401 --> 30:37.067
to know that
it's time to back down.

30:37.069 --> 30:38.468
Do you think that she will?

30:38.470 --> 30:43.307
She perceived a power vacuum
and moved to fill it.

30:43.309 --> 30:45.042
Sure you wouldn't have
done the same thing?

30:45.044 --> 30:47.544
Are you playing
the diplomat now?

30:47.546 --> 30:49.880
Cajoling me to look
past her aggressions?

30:49.882 --> 30:52.916
I just want the animosity
between our nations to end.

30:52.918 --> 30:54.852
As do I.

30:54.854 --> 30:56.520
¶ I need to remember ¶

30:56.522 --> 30:57.988
¶ How it was ¶

31:07.066 --> 31:09.132
(singer vocalizing)

31:17.576 --> 31:18.876
NARCISSE:
Lola.

31:33.092 --> 31:35.626
You are guilty of
conspiring to assassinate

31:35.628 --> 31:37.895
Her Majesty,
Queen Elizabeth of England.

31:37.897 --> 31:39.429
NARCISSE:
Lola!

31:39.431 --> 31:41.198
GUARD:
Do you have any last words

31:41.200 --> 31:43.166
as you stand before
your queen and your God?

31:43.168 --> 31:44.635
(sobbing)

31:44.637 --> 31:45.669
(crying):
Stephan, go.

31:45.671 --> 31:47.537
I don't want you to see this.

31:48.908 --> 31:49.673
(crying)

31:49.675 --> 31:51.942
(panting):
Protect my son.

31:51.944 --> 31:53.143
Tell John I love him.

31:53.145 --> 31:55.078
Tell him every day.

31:56.448 --> 31:57.681
(crying, gasping)

31:59.551 --> 32:00.617
No!

32:00.619 --> 32:03.353
(Narcisse grunts, crowd yells)

32:03.355 --> 32:04.621
(groans)

32:05.524 --> 32:06.590

Stop him!

32:12.564 --> 32:14.598
(grunting)

32:16.201 --> 32:17.935
Stephan,

32:17.937 --> 32:20.437
let me go.

32:20.439 --> 32:22.005
(sobs)

32:26.111 --> 32:28.211

32:28.213 --> 32:29.379

No!

(slicing sound)

32:32.952 --> 32:36.620
¶ ¶

32:56.342 --> 32:57.574
LEITH:
No one admitted to helping them,

32:57.576 --> 32:58.675
but I've seen people
sneaking food and provisions

32:58.677 --> 33:00.243
into the barn.

33:00.245 --> 33:02.379
Once we have it surrounded,
we set it on fire.

33:02.381 --> 33:04.314
The smoke will
drive out the Red Knights,

33:04.316 --> 33:06.283
and our archers
will pick them off.

33:06.285 --> 33:07.351
As for the village
sympathizers...

33:07.353 --> 33:08.585
Not to be spared.

33:08.587 --> 33:10.654
Per the king.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.223
Everyone clear?

33:13.225 --> 33:14.358
Then let's move.

33:14.360 --> 33:17.260
I have a message
from King Charles.

33:17.262 --> 33:18.528
He wanted it
delivered in private.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.230
Yes, what is it?

33:20.232 --> 33:24.301
(grunts, gasps)

33:27.573 --> 33:29.506
VILLAGER:
What's all this?

33:31.543 --> 33:33.243
(grunts)
(groans)

33:33.245 --> 33:35.312
King's men.

33:35.314 --> 33:37.748
They must have come
for the Knights.

33:37.750 --> 33:40.217
Smoke. They've set
fire to the barn.

33:40.219 --> 33:43.487
(villagers shouting
indistinctly)

33:46.058 --> 33:49.693
Claude.

33:49.695 --> 33:51.194
(grunting loudly)

33:59.138 --> 34:01.738
JAMES: Word has spread
of your fairness.

34:01.740 --> 34:03.306
The justice you delivered,

34:03.308 --> 34:05.175
even to those who
do not share your faith.

34:05.177 --> 34:07.144
Requests are pouring in

34:07.146 --> 34:09.346
from burgs all around, begging
for a visit from the queen.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.717
What's wrong?

34:13.719 --> 34:17.554
There was an assassination
attempt on Elizabeth.

34:17.556 --> 34:18.822
Is she all right?

34:18.824 --> 34:20.290
She is, but, Mary,

34:20.292 --> 34:22.559
Lola was said to be involved.

34:22.561 --> 34:23.660
No.

34:23.662 --> 34:25.562
She was beheaded.

34:25.564 --> 34:28.632
I'm so sorry.

34:28.634 --> 34:31.301
I don't understand.

34:31.303 --> 34:33.070
Lola would never.

34:33.072 --> 34:35.172
There-there must be
some kind of mistake.

34:35.174 --> 34:37.340
Her punishment was
carried out very quickly.

34:37.342 --> 34:39.743
Or is this whole thing some lie

34:39.745 --> 34:41.244
that Elizabeth manufactured

34:41.246 --> 34:43.280
because she lost
her bid for Scotland?

34:43.282 --> 34:45.515
And did she kill
my friend to punish me?

34:45.517 --> 34:47.217
Where was Narcisse?

34:47.219 --> 34:48.685
He tried to intercede.

34:48.687 --> 34:50.120
He's in prison.

34:50.122 --> 34:51.321
And our spies confirmed

34:51.323 --> 34:53.423
there was an
assassination attempt.

34:53.425 --> 34:56.326
Lola would never...

34:56.328 --> 35:00.363
be involved with
something like this.

35:00.365 --> 35:01.465
Who would implicate her?

35:03.368 --> 35:06.169
Who?

35:06.171 --> 35:07.771
It was you, wasn't it?

35:07.773 --> 35:10.407
That's why you ignored the
threat that Elizabeth posed,

35:10.409 --> 35:12.442
because you hoped
she'd be dead soon,

35:12.444 --> 35:14.111
assassinated.

35:14.113 --> 35:16.379
You don't think,
based on one small bit of logic,

35:16.381 --> 35:18.648
that I would confess to trying
to kill a queen?

35:18.650 --> 35:24.187
I also know that you set up a
presence near Elizabeth's court.

35:24.189 --> 35:27.657
My sister, who is heartbroken,

35:27.659 --> 35:29.626
admitted that she and Lola
traded information

35:29.628 --> 35:31.361
using coded letters.

35:31.363 --> 35:32.629
Did you have Lady Lola watched?

35:32.631 --> 35:35.198
Your spy reading her letters,

35:35.200 --> 35:38.435
learning their code,
forging a letter from Mary.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.671
Your comprehension
of espionage is impressive.

35:41.673 --> 35:45.609
You used Lola so that Mary
would be tied to the attempt.

35:45.611 --> 35:48.311
So that even if it failed,

35:48.313 --> 35:51.414
it would become personal
between Mary and Elizabeth.

35:51.416 --> 35:54.351
(sighs)

35:54.353 --> 35:57.220
They're like
two spiders in a jar.

35:57.222 --> 35:59.656
They can't coexist, they can't
let the other survive.

35:59.658 --> 36:04.194
Still, sometimes someone needs
to give the jar a good shake.

36:09.168 --> 36:11.168
I could tell Mary
what you've done.

36:11.170 --> 36:12.536
With what proof?

36:12.538 --> 36:14.471
Only your speculation,

36:14.473 --> 36:15.705
which, yes,

36:15.707 --> 36:17.407
she might believe,

36:17.409 --> 36:19.242
causing her to come after me.

36:19.244 --> 36:20.577
Is that what you want her doing?

36:20.579 --> 36:23.246
Attacking the religious leader
of the country

36:23.248 --> 36:25.582
when she has sworn tolerance?

36:25.584 --> 36:26.883
Who's shaking the jar then?

36:30.556 --> 36:34.257
If you care about your sister,

36:34.259 --> 36:36.193
you won't give her
reason to misstep.

36:36.195 --> 36:37.661
And if I care about my sister,

36:37.663 --> 36:39.796
what do I do about you?

36:39.798 --> 36:42.532
Play all sides
as you have always done,

36:42.534 --> 36:44.334
but be sure to stay on mine,

36:44.336 --> 36:47.504
because Mary's rule
will not last.

36:47.506 --> 36:50.974
Scotland could be the first true
democracy since the Greeks,

36:50.976 --> 36:52.976
and you could be

36:52.978 --> 36:55.278
its first leader.

37:01.853 --> 37:03.386
Sorry I'm late.

37:03.388 --> 37:06.489
I had to deliver
some terrible news.

37:08.493 --> 37:10.360
Melaniee.

37:11.863 --> 37:14.497
Who are you really?

37:14.499 --> 37:17.867
For a moment, I was
Melaniee, wasn't I?

37:17.869 --> 37:21.004
People see what
they want to see.

37:21.006 --> 37:24.741
Catholics, Protestants,
they see evil in each other

37:24.743 --> 37:27.577
when fear is the real evil.

37:27.579 --> 37:28.878
But you were raised

37:28.880 --> 37:30.947
in an older faith, weren't you?

37:30.949 --> 37:32.582
How do you know that?

37:32.584 --> 37:33.850
Pagan, Druid--

37:33.852 --> 37:36.386
both respect this earth
and its powers.

37:36.388 --> 37:38.255
We can teach them to you.

37:38.257 --> 37:39.489
You'll need them,

37:39.491 --> 37:41.258
if you want to help Mary.

37:41.260 --> 37:43.627
But first you have to admit

37:43.629 --> 37:46.463
you have seen things
that others have not.

37:46.465 --> 37:49.466
You have to believe.

37:49.468 --> 37:53.036
Do you, Sebastian?

37:53.972 --> 37:57.340
(bell tolls)

37:59.611 --> 38:01.778
Charles!

38:01.780 --> 38:03.947
My dearest son,

38:03.949 --> 38:06.483
you can't hug your big brother
whenever you'd like;

38:06.485 --> 38:08.551
he's king at the moment.

38:09.988 --> 38:11.488
Give us a minute, darling.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.994
(sighs)

38:17.996 --> 38:19.562
What is he doing here, Mother?

38:19.564 --> 38:22.032
Well, I brought him back
to keep him safe.

38:22.034 --> 38:26.536
And to serve as a reminder
to you and to everyone, really,

38:26.538 --> 38:27.837
just how many sons I have

38:27.839 --> 38:30.440
and how replaceable you are.

38:30.442 --> 38:31.508
Are you threatening me?

38:31.510 --> 38:32.842
I don't have to,

38:32.844 --> 38:35.545
because the monarchy
is a system that works.

38:35.547 --> 38:36.846
Someone must rule,

38:36.848 --> 38:38.515
and if you,

38:38.517 --> 38:40.517
the king, should suddenly die,

38:40.519 --> 38:42.636
your little brothers

38:42.637 --> 38:44.754
come with a very wise and
seasoned regent at their side.

38:48.060 --> 38:49.543
Your talk of family.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.027
You said it mattered
more than anything.

38:51.029 --> 38:52.762
You taught me otherwise.

38:53.765 --> 38:55.665
Come.

38:59.538 --> 39:01.471
You say that I'm in danger,
and yet you're leaving me.

39:01.473 --> 39:02.639
I don't understand.

39:02.641 --> 39:04.074
I'm not sure I do either,

39:04.076 --> 39:05.775
but if you were harmed
and I could have saved you...

39:05.777 --> 39:07.010
Save me how?

39:07.012 --> 39:08.845
By joining a band of Druids?

39:09.948 --> 39:12.615
Bash, you've seen how they live,

39:12.617 --> 39:14.784
hand to mouth,
how they are persecuted.

39:14.786 --> 39:16.619
I've seen other things, too.

39:16.621 --> 39:18.088
Mary, I've seen the dead.

39:18.090 --> 39:20.657
I've seen them walk the halls
of the castle.

39:20.659 --> 39:23.593
A girl during the plague.

39:23.595 --> 39:25.929
Others, too, in the shadows.

39:25.931 --> 39:29.599
Well, that was
just exhaustion and...

39:29.601 --> 39:30.767
And what?

39:30.769 --> 39:32.001
It wasn't grief.

39:32.003 --> 39:33.636
I've seen souls I barely knew.

39:33.638 --> 39:35.939
Have you seen others?

39:35.941 --> 39:37.374
Francis?

39:37.376 --> 39:39.376
No.

39:39.378 --> 39:41.678
But these people,
they can teach me.

39:41.680 --> 39:44.047
They say that what I am
is a "seer."

39:44.049 --> 39:45.715
That, in time, I can help you.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.016
By talking to the dead?

39:47.018 --> 39:48.785
By looking into the future.

39:48.787 --> 39:51.054
Did you ever speak with
Nostradamus about his gift?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.522
It evolved,

39:52.524 --> 39:53.790
it took time.

39:53.792 --> 39:55.725
I have to go.

39:57.396 --> 39:59.763
Not just for you but for myself.

40:01.666 --> 40:03.967
But I will come to you

40:03.969 --> 40:05.835
when you need me the most.

40:05.837 --> 40:08.037
Of this I am sure.

40:28.527 --> 40:29.759
GIDEON:
I got your message.

40:29.761 --> 40:31.528
Your scout was very discreet,

40:31.530 --> 40:34.597
but should you be here
so close to the border?

40:34.599 --> 40:37.066
I had to see you before
you returned home.

40:37.068 --> 40:38.902
(exhales)

40:43.475 --> 40:44.841
I'm glad.

40:44.843 --> 40:47.076
But there is something
I need to ask of you.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.747
Get close to Elizabeth

40:50.749 --> 40:52.782
the way she asked you
to get close to me.

40:52.784 --> 40:55.218
The way you have
gotten close to me.

40:55.220 --> 40:56.753
Mary, no.

40:56.755 --> 40:57.954
Bring me her secrets.

40:57.956 --> 40:59.722
You are angry because of Lola.

40:59.724 --> 41:03.092
Lola died because she got caught
between Elizabeth and me.

41:03.094 --> 41:04.828
Too many people I love

41:04.830 --> 41:07.664
have died trying to bring peace,

41:07.666 --> 41:08.998
trying to save me.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.700
I need to end this

41:10.702 --> 41:12.168
before anyone else
who has the misfortune

41:12.170 --> 41:14.003
of being in my life dies.

41:14.005 --> 41:15.538
Do not kill Elizabeth.

41:15.540 --> 41:16.706
There will be much retaliation.

41:16.708 --> 41:18.174
I have no intention
of killing her.

41:18.176 --> 41:22.045
I will dismantle her power
bit by bit.

41:22.047 --> 41:24.147
Every choice I make,

41:24.149 --> 41:28.685
who I fight, who I support,
who I am marrying,

41:28.687 --> 41:31.087
will be in service
of taking her throne.

41:37.762 --> 41:42.065
Her nation, England,

41:42.067 --> 41:44.701
someday it will be mine.
