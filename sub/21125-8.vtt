00:07.075 --> 00:09.377
- Okay, this is
making it worse.

00:09.677 --> 00:11.045
[sighs]

00:11.145 --> 00:14.115
Mags, this is not working.

00:14.215 --> 00:17.251
[sighs] I'll try the crimper.
Hello, old friend.

00:17.351 --> 00:19.019
- Hey, that's too many
hot tools.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.454
- Nope.
- Put down the crimper.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.390
- I got it--no.
- Step away from the crimper.

00:22.490 --> 00:23.791
- I need it.
- Nobody needs a crimper.

00:23.891 --> 00:26.160
- No, look at what chemo
has done to my hair.

00:26.260 --> 00:27.795
I look like
Dog the Bounty Hunter.

00:27.895 --> 00:30.098
- You may feel like
Dog the Bounty Hunter inside,

00:30.198 --> 00:31.799
but you don't look like him--
that's crazy.

00:31.899 --> 00:33.267
- Yes, I do. It's like...

00:33.367 --> 00:34.568
[pounds on table]
Hey! Ronny Trevin!

00:34.668 --> 00:36.304
You get on out here
and make those payments

00:36.404 --> 00:37.305
on your Mazda Miata!

00:37.405 --> 00:39.207
- Who's Ronny Trevin?

00:39.307 --> 00:41.142
- He's the scumbag that the Dog
is trying to take down.

00:41.242 --> 00:42.443
- Why do you have
a Southern accent?

00:42.543 --> 00:44.145
He lives in Hawaii.
- I don't know.

00:44.245 --> 00:45.546
I've never seen it.
[sighs]

00:45.646 --> 00:47.415
- Okay,
you just finished chemo,

00:47.515 --> 00:49.183
and we're going to dinner
to celebrate

00:49.283 --> 00:52.086
with our new boyfriends, okay?

00:52.186 --> 00:54.188
* Our boyfriends
- What is that?

00:54.288 --> 00:55.556
- * Oh, yeah, the boyfriends
- Oh, my God.

00:55.656 --> 00:58.058
- Oh, yeah. So go put on that
dress that we bought you

00:58.159 --> 01:00.294
that shows off your new tit-ays,
and let's hit the road.

01:00.394 --> 01:02.563
- No, these are not ready
for public consumption.

01:02.663 --> 01:04.665
- All right, I'll just call
Dr. E and tell him

01:04.765 --> 01:06.467
to cancel our reservation...
- Okay, thank you.

01:06.567 --> 01:08.636
- At Simon.
- Simon?

01:08.736 --> 01:10.204
- That's right, friend.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.572
- How did he get
a reservation at Simon?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.441
- Because he's
Dr. Clive Ericson...

01:13.541 --> 01:15.075
* Uh, my boyfriend
- Oh, God, don't do that.

01:15.176 --> 01:16.577
- * My boyfriend
- No, please. No.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.379
- * My boyfriend
- Please, never let him

01:18.479 --> 01:20.448
see you do this.
- It's too late.

01:20.548 --> 01:23.584
And he's sticking around, which
is good news for everybody.

01:23.684 --> 01:25.553
- All right, fine.
I will go.

01:25.653 --> 01:27.555
But can you please try and do
something with this hair?

01:27.655 --> 01:29.523
- Yes, I'll straight up
Truvy that wig.

01:29.623 --> 01:31.325
"Steely Mags" style.
- Okay.

01:31.425 --> 01:34.662
- Step into my salon.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.497
Just gonna segment it,
and then we're gonna

01:36.597 --> 01:38.599
get a lot of hot air
right at the root.

01:38.699 --> 01:40.534
[hair dryer whirring loudly]

01:40.634 --> 01:42.470
[whirring stops]
- Oh.

01:42.570 --> 01:45.339
I guess that was
too many hot tools.

01:45.439 --> 01:47.408
- Dog, you did it again.

01:47.508 --> 01:49.343
[Say Hi's "Back before
We Were Brittle" playing]

01:49.443 --> 01:52.213
- * Hey, remember when

01:52.313 --> 01:55.115
* All of time stood still

01:55.216 --> 01:59.487
* Ooh, do do do do

01:59.587 --> 02:03.391
* Back before we were brittle

02:03.491 --> 02:07.361
* Back before
we were brittle *

02:07.461 --> 02:09.330
- Hey, will you text the guys

02:09.430 --> 02:10.898
and tell them that we're just
gonna quick get our hair done

02:10.998 --> 02:12.433
and then we'll be right there?

02:12.533 --> 02:14.302
- I'm gonna text them
that we're not coming,

02:14.402 --> 02:16.437
'cause let's face it--
we're never gonna get there.

02:16.537 --> 02:18.606
- What are you talking about?
- It's happening.

02:18.706 --> 02:21.242
I can feel it in my,
until very recently,

02:21.342 --> 02:22.610
cancer-filled bones--

02:22.710 --> 02:24.645
the Crawford Curse.
- Oh, my God.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.447
Not this old thing again.
- Listen to me.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.516
- That is not what's happening.
- Since the 1800s,

02:28.616 --> 02:31.285
whenever something is going well
for the Crawfords,

02:31.385 --> 02:33.654
boom, something bad happens.
- You just had cancer,

02:33.754 --> 02:35.223
so I think you're good
for a while.

02:35.323 --> 02:36.490
- All right.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.692
- Hey, tonight
we are celebrating, okay?

02:38.792 --> 02:40.694
Also, there is no curse.

02:40.794 --> 02:42.463
[thud, tires screech]
Oh, my God. Are you kidding me?

02:42.563 --> 02:44.265
[flat tire flopping]
- My bones always know.

02:44.365 --> 02:45.666
- [sighs] Okay, I'll find
a place to pull over.

02:45.766 --> 02:47.235
There's a spare in the back.
- No, no, no.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.402
You can't change it
in this dress.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.637
You're gonna get grease
all over it.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.405
- Who you think
you're talking to?

02:51.505 --> 02:53.274
You know I come prepared.

02:53.374 --> 02:55.543
All right.
- Why is this taking so long?

02:55.643 --> 02:58.279
- Excuse me?
Do you want to do this?

02:58.379 --> 02:59.680
Or am I the tire expert?

02:59.780 --> 03:02.283
You need to say "thank you"
to your old pal Bocephus.

03:02.383 --> 03:04.585
- This is ridiculous.
- No, it's not.

03:04.685 --> 03:07.221
This is exactly why I keep
this getup in the trunk--

03:07.321 --> 03:08.522
for scrapes like this one.

03:08.622 --> 03:10.658
- I thought I got rid
of that stupid hat.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.226
- Oh, you know Bocephus

03:12.326 --> 03:14.194
always gonna rise
from the ashes.

03:14.295 --> 03:16.597
- [sighs]
- Ooh, Jandana Banana.

03:16.697 --> 03:18.499
What you got
on the top bits, here?

03:18.599 --> 03:20.701
You got some new merchandise?
- All right, don't touch.

03:20.801 --> 03:22.570
- Let me get a feel.
- Don't you touch my boobs.

03:22.670 --> 03:23.637
- Ooh.
- Don't.

03:23.737 --> 03:24.772
- Ooh, they feel like
a waterbeds.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.507
- Okay.
- Oh, no.

03:26.607 --> 03:28.208
More like Jelly Bellies.
- Please give me a tender touch.

03:28.309 --> 03:30.311
What is this?
- That's my crab grabbing.

03:30.411 --> 03:32.280
- [laughing] Crab grabbing.

03:32.380 --> 03:33.714
- Text the guys and tell them
we're on our way.

03:33.814 --> 03:35.483
- Got it.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.585
Hey, can you toss me the keys?
I got to open the car.

03:37.685 --> 03:39.587
- No, no, no. You have the keys.
- No, I don't.

03:39.687 --> 03:41.455
- Well, I--
I left them in the ignition.

03:41.555 --> 03:43.223
- Well, then
they're locked in the car.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.758
- No, no, no, no.
- [sighs]

03:44.858 --> 03:46.494
- No!
- Told you.

03:46.594 --> 03:47.661
It's the Crawford Curse.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.430
- It's not the curse.
It's you!

03:49.530 --> 03:53.467
- The only thing to do now
is to give in.

03:53.567 --> 03:56.470
- [shouting goofily]

04:01.775 --> 04:03.744
- Clive.
Oh, good to see you.

04:03.844 --> 04:05.546
- How are you?
- Oh, good. Yeah.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.015
Wow, this place is--
- Yeah, it's pretty fancy, huh?

04:08.115 --> 04:09.650
- Yeah.
- Not quite my speed.

04:09.750 --> 04:11.685
- Yeah, I'm more of
a DiGiorno's Pizza type of guy.

04:11.785 --> 04:14.322
- It's not delivery.
- No. It's DiGiorno.

04:14.422 --> 04:16.324
- DiGiorno.
- Right? [laughs]

04:16.424 --> 04:18.258
All right, well,
the girls just texted.

04:18.359 --> 04:20.528
They're running a little late,
blow-drying their hair.

04:20.628 --> 04:22.463
- Women.
[laughs]

04:22.563 --> 04:24.632
Sorry, no, I shouldn't--that--
It's 2017.

04:24.732 --> 04:25.766
I probably shouldn't
say things like that.

04:25.866 --> 04:27.568
- Yeah. It's fine. It's fine.

04:27.668 --> 04:30.404
- [faux German accent]
An amuse-bouche from the chef.

04:30.504 --> 04:32.373
- Oh, actually, our dates
a running a little bit late.

04:32.473 --> 04:35.275
So we should probably hold off
on any amuses of the bouche.

04:35.376 --> 04:37.745
- Once Chef Simon begins
your culinary adventure...

04:37.845 --> 04:39.613
- Did he just say "semen"?
- That can't be right.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.715
- There is no stopping.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.685
Tonight's adventure
is called "Lift Off."

04:44.785 --> 04:47.588
We begin with an exploration
of the forest floor.

04:47.688 --> 04:49.890
Amidst the grubs
and the mealworms,

04:49.990 --> 04:53.427
we discover our inspiration.

04:53.527 --> 04:55.429
- Okay.

04:55.529 --> 04:57.565
- The beginning of life!

04:57.665 --> 04:59.733
- What the--

04:59.833 --> 05:02.503
It's a bowl of dirt.
- Yeah, I--

05:02.603 --> 05:04.572
I think it's--
I think it's a salad.

05:04.672 --> 05:06.306
- Okay. Well, here goes nothing.
- Yeah.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.542
- You gonna do it?
We'll do it at the same time.

05:08.642 --> 05:11.812
- Yeah, yeah.
- This feels like dirt.

05:11.912 --> 05:13.547
- Mmm.
- Well, shit, Simon.

05:13.647 --> 05:15.783
That's delicious.
- It's "Semen."

05:20.153 --> 05:21.789
- Are you sure
you don't have any snacks?

05:21.889 --> 05:24.558
- No. I gave you
the beef jerky I had.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.560
- I don't want--
that was not beef jerky.

05:26.660 --> 05:28.328
- It was too--
it was an old Omaha Steak

05:28.429 --> 05:30.364
that had dried in my trunk.

05:30.464 --> 05:32.833
- So what's your big plan?
We're just gonna sit here

05:32.933 --> 05:34.535
for the rest of our lives?
- Yes.

05:34.635 --> 05:36.370
'Cause in
an emergency situation,

05:36.470 --> 05:38.939
you're supposed to stay put.

05:39.039 --> 05:41.341
Oh, interesting.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.543
Hey.

05:42.643 --> 05:44.845
- Maggie, Emma.
- Mr. Nanjiani?

05:44.945 --> 05:46.880
- Look at me.
I'm a Lyft driver.

05:46.980 --> 05:49.483
You need a lift?
- Yes, we do. Thank you.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.719
- Too bad. I already got
somebody in the back.

05:51.819 --> 05:53.621
- What?
Then why did you ask?

05:53.721 --> 05:57.725
- Unless what happens
in the back seat

05:57.825 --> 05:59.827
stays in the back seat.

05:59.927 --> 06:06.834
*

06:09.169 --> 06:12.473
- Hey, um, thank you so much
for letting us tag along.

06:12.573 --> 06:15.142
- Oh, my pleasure. You look like
you needed a helping hand.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.610
[both chuckle]
Where y'all going?

06:16.710 --> 06:18.746
I assume you didn't
leave your house

06:18.846 --> 06:21.148
intending to look like this.

06:21.248 --> 06:23.617
- We were supposed to
have dinner with our boyfriends.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.753
- Yeah, it was to celebrate
this one finishing chemo

06:25.853 --> 06:27.755
'cause she just
kicked breast cancer's ass.

06:27.855 --> 06:29.490
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.892
But we're not gonna get there
because I'm cursed.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.694
- Oh, my God.
- And I just want to apologize

06:33.794 --> 06:35.896
because it's most likely
gonna rub off on you as well.

06:35.996 --> 06:38.632
- Nothing rubs off on me
unless I want it to.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.501
Plus, if you were cursed,
you'd be dead.

06:40.601 --> 06:42.169
Curse people
don't survive cancer.

06:42.269 --> 06:43.904
- Thank you. Exactly.

06:44.004 --> 06:47.508
- What is this, "Sixth Sense"?
Am I seeing dead people here?

06:47.608 --> 06:49.777
You know what?
I'm trying to break myself

06:49.877 --> 06:51.712
of this habit
of taking in stray dogs.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.614
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm.

06:53.714 --> 06:55.916
But I can't in good conscious
let you got meet your men

06:56.016 --> 06:58.652
looking the way you look, so...

06:58.752 --> 07:00.954
Look, I have a question.
Give me your hands.

07:02.690 --> 07:05.192
Do you trust me?

07:05.292 --> 07:06.794
- Well, we just met, but--
- Yes.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.797
- Wise. Wise.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.832
All right, girls,
right this way.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.835
[upbeat club music]

07:14.935 --> 07:16.570
*

07:16.670 --> 07:18.839
- Holy shit.

07:18.939 --> 07:21.675
This is like every dream
I've ever had coming true.

07:21.775 --> 07:25.779
- We're about to change
your lives.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.919
- I mean, I can't go
back to Tijuana,

07:32.653 --> 07:33.621
but at least I got
a good story.

07:34.287 --> 07:35.455
[laughter]
- Oh, my God.

07:36.657 --> 07:37.491
- You guys, this is literally
a dream come true for me.

07:38.626 --> 07:39.159
I've seen every episode
of "RuPaul's Drag Race."

07:39.893 --> 07:40.961
both: Twice.
- That's right.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.230
This one can lip-synch for her
life with the best of 'em.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.732
- Yes.
- Oh, can she?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.067
- What is going on
with all this kinky, curly hair

07:47.167 --> 07:48.536
at the root, girl?

07:48.636 --> 07:50.203
You look like, um--
- Dog the Bounty Hunter?

07:50.303 --> 07:51.739
- Yes! Yes.
- Yeah!

07:51.839 --> 07:53.574
- She just finished chemo
for breast cancer,

07:53.674 --> 07:55.475
so we should maybe
go easy on her.

07:55.576 --> 07:57.077
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.145
- Oh, no, thank you.
No, no. I'm fine.

07:58.245 --> 08:00.247
- You know, my mom and my
grandmother both had it.

08:00.347 --> 08:02.215
- Oh, I'm so sorry.
Are they--are they--

08:02.315 --> 08:04.518
- No! My grandma's 103,

08:04.618 --> 08:06.219
and my mom is asking
for grandchildren.

08:06.319 --> 08:08.155
That's a bigger conversation.

08:08.255 --> 08:09.590
- We're all survivors
of something.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.791
- Can I get an amen?

08:10.891 --> 08:12.259
- Amen.
- Hallelu!

08:12.359 --> 08:14.528
- And that is worth celebrating.
- That's right.

08:14.628 --> 08:16.697
- Yeah, and so are these
new boobs, mama.

08:16.797 --> 08:19.232
You got to put these double Ds
in the window, girl.

08:19.332 --> 08:21.168
- Yeah, girl, you need to
let the dogs out.

08:21.268 --> 08:23.637
- I know. I just don't feel
like they're mine, you know?

08:23.737 --> 08:25.038
- Did you pay for 'em?
- You got the receipts?

08:25.138 --> 08:26.106
- Yeah.
- They're yours.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.675
- Okay.

08:27.775 --> 08:29.109
- A wise woman once told me,

08:29.209 --> 08:33.080
"We're all born naked,
and the rest is drag!"

08:33.180 --> 08:34.648
What about you?

08:34.748 --> 08:36.717
- Who? Me?
- Yeah, you.

08:36.817 --> 08:38.118
I mean, you're the caretaker.

08:38.218 --> 08:39.753
- Oh, no, no. I'm good.
- Oh, no, no.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.254
You guys don't understand.

08:41.354 --> 08:43.691
She was with me
at every single chemo.

08:43.791 --> 08:45.826
She packed me in ice
from head to toe.

08:45.926 --> 08:47.561
- Like a choice piece
of holiday meat.

08:47.661 --> 08:49.997
- Yes. This is all
while going to nursing school

08:50.097 --> 08:52.132
and taking care of the cutest
baby in the entire world.

08:52.232 --> 08:53.734
- It's just life.
It's just being a woman.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.268
Am I right? Am I right?
- Oh, give me a break, man.

08:55.368 --> 08:57.605
- Maggie, you got to get crazy.
- What does that mean?

08:57.705 --> 09:00.273
- I'm talking,
you got to get crazy, girl.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
I'm talking "Britney Spears,
shaved head,

09:02.643 --> 09:04.745
attacks car
with an umbrella" crazy.

09:04.845 --> 09:09.049
Listen, my great-uncle, PeeWee--
he used to always say,

09:09.149 --> 09:12.219
"Sometimes you got to
let the rough end drag."

09:12.319 --> 09:13.721
- I'd love to know
what that means.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.155
- Girls? Girls, girls,
girls, girls, girls!

09:15.255 --> 09:16.790
Oh, God!
- Oh, my God.

09:16.890 --> 09:18.726
- We have an emergency.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.628
- Bitch, if you're gonna
come in here that excited,

09:20.728 --> 09:22.329
you better have
something real dramatic to say.

09:22.429 --> 09:24.632
- Ms. Chi Chi Royale
and Banana Daiquiri

09:24.732 --> 09:27.668
are over there on a cruise,
whale watching in P Town,

09:27.768 --> 09:29.069
and the ship ran ashore!

09:29.169 --> 09:31.038
How's that for dramatics?
Damn!

09:31.138 --> 09:33.306
- That is, like,
the second time this week.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.308
Like, why do people love
watching whales so much?

09:35.408 --> 09:36.777
- They come here
every week for her.

09:36.877 --> 09:38.879
both: Oh!
- Truth. Through.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.347
Now who's gonna
do "Proud Mary"?

09:40.447 --> 09:42.182
- Not us.
- Oh, no, no, no.

09:42.282 --> 09:43.784
- Katya?
- I'm not in the mood.

09:43.884 --> 09:45.118
I'm not in the mood.
I don't have the body for it.

09:45.218 --> 09:46.186
No, no, no.
- We'll do it.

09:46.286 --> 09:47.788
We'll do "Proud Mary."

09:47.888 --> 09:50.157
- What are you talking about?
We're not drag queens.

09:50.257 --> 09:52.660
- We're just, like, one set
of false eyelashes away from it.

09:52.760 --> 09:55.763
- Wait, do you guys really think
you can do this?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.130
- Well, I mean,
I don't know.

09:57.230 --> 09:59.299
We never, ever do
nothing nice...

09:59.399 --> 10:01.368
- Ooh, ooh!
- And easy.

10:01.468 --> 10:04.137
- We always do it
nice and rough.

10:04.237 --> 10:05.639
[all shouting happily]
- All right!

10:05.739 --> 10:08.275
[laughter]
- Whoo!

10:08.375 --> 10:09.910
- Should we be worried
about the girls?

10:10.010 --> 10:12.379
- As far as we know,
they might be in jail.

10:12.479 --> 10:14.181
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

10:14.281 --> 10:16.316
Yeah, I've arrested them
multiple times.

10:16.416 --> 10:17.918
[chuckles]

10:18.018 --> 10:19.619
No, no, no, the charges
have always been dropped.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.822
- What sort of other things
have they gotten into?

10:21.922 --> 10:22.823
- Oh, gosh, let me think.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.324
Nothing huge.
- Right.

10:24.424 --> 10:26.794
- A lot of chicanery,
tomfoolery, and shenanigans.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.361
- "Shenanigans"?
- Yeah.

10:28.461 --> 10:30.898
For instance, I assumed
that it was just gonna be

10:30.998 --> 10:34.134
the two of us
at least for an hour and a half.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.369
- Okay.
- And I'm not having a bad time.

10:36.469 --> 10:38.105
- Me neither.
It's quite enjoyable.

10:38.205 --> 10:39.372
- [chuckles]

10:39.472 --> 10:41.108
- What was enjoyable--
your forest floor?

10:41.208 --> 10:42.642
- Yes, it was delicious.
Thank you.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.844
- Did you eat the rocks?

10:43.944 --> 10:46.814
- Oh, yeah.
- You should not have.

10:46.914 --> 10:50.684
Our next course--we raise up to
the canopy of the rain forest.

10:50.784 --> 10:54.254
As water gives life,
so sun...

10:54.354 --> 10:56.724
grows roots.
- Mm.

10:56.824 --> 10:58.425
- What--what--uh, what is this?

10:58.525 --> 10:59.727
- It's a tree.

10:59.827 --> 11:00.961
- What are we supposed
to do with it?

11:01.061 --> 11:02.696
- Cut it down.

11:04.732 --> 11:06.734
["Proud Mary" playing]

11:06.834 --> 11:10.137
- You know, sometimes you take
in a stray dog off the streets.

11:10.237 --> 11:11.304
- Yeah!

11:11.404 --> 11:13.807
- And they just look nasty

11:13.907 --> 11:16.710
'cause it's been
on the street, surviving!

11:16.810 --> 11:20.247
But then you wash it up,
clean it behind the ears,

11:20.347 --> 11:21.681
and damn it if you don't have

11:21.782 --> 11:23.751
a pure-bred Shih Tzu
on your hands.

11:23.851 --> 11:27.387
[cheers from crowd]
- I have two survivors

11:27.487 --> 11:31.424
doing a tribute to the greatest
survivor of all time--

11:31.524 --> 11:34.962
Miss Tina Turner!

11:35.062 --> 11:37.364
[cheers and applause]
- * Rolling on the river

11:37.464 --> 11:41.434
- * Rolling on the river

11:41.534 --> 11:43.236
[cheers and applause]

11:43.336 --> 11:49.910
*

11:53.814 --> 11:56.850
- * Oh, I left a good job
in the city *

11:56.950 --> 11:59.853
* Working for the man,
every night and day *

11:59.953 --> 12:02.189
* And I never lost
one minute of sleep *

12:02.289 --> 12:05.292
* And worrying about the way
things might have been *

12:05.392 --> 12:07.460
* Big wheel keep on turning
- * Turning

12:07.560 --> 12:09.429
- * Proud Mary
keep on burning *

12:09.529 --> 12:10.931
- * Burning

12:11.031 --> 12:12.465
- * Rolling
- * Yeah

12:12.565 --> 12:13.901
- * Rolling *
- * All right

12:14.001 --> 12:15.468
- * Rolling on the river

12:15.568 --> 12:17.237
- * All good now
- * Rolling

12:17.337 --> 12:18.772
* Said, "Rolling"
- * Yeah

12:18.872 --> 12:21.274
* Rolling on the river

12:21.374 --> 12:23.043
* Come on, doo, doo, doo, doo

12:23.143 --> 12:25.813
* Doo, doo, doo, doo,
doo, doo, doo *

12:25.913 --> 12:31.284
*

12:31.384 --> 12:33.486
[cheers and applause]

12:33.586 --> 12:35.923
* All right

12:36.023 --> 12:37.891
* I said, "Rolling"

12:37.991 --> 12:39.259
* Rolling

12:39.359 --> 12:41.494
* Rolling on the river...

12:41.594 --> 12:44.264
[cheers and applause fade]

12:44.364 --> 12:45.498
- Oh, there, I got it.
- There we are.

12:45.598 --> 12:47.968
- Yep.
- Timber. [chuckles]

12:48.068 --> 12:51.771
Hey, so, um,
I just wanted to say

12:51.872 --> 12:54.341
thank you for everything
you've done for Emma.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.443
- No, come on.
- No, you went above and beyond.

12:56.543 --> 12:58.311
Those doctors you found
saved her life.

12:58.411 --> 13:00.413
And I know you've been answering
her crazy questions

13:00.513 --> 13:02.315
late at night,
which I'm sure is a lot.

13:02.415 --> 13:03.951
- I had to upgrade
my data package.

13:04.051 --> 13:05.085
- [chuckles]

13:05.185 --> 13:06.920
- So how are you doing
in all of this?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.856
- Um, yeah, no.
I'm doing--I'm doing okay.

13:08.956 --> 13:10.457
- Yeah? You good?

13:10.557 --> 13:12.459
- Yeah, I mean, I hate
that I can't fix it for her.

13:12.559 --> 13:14.828
- Yeah.
- It's--it's terrifying,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.529
'cause it's--'cause it's
the woman that is the woman

13:16.629 --> 13:18.031
I want to spend
the rest of my life with.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.867
- I didn't realize
you guys were so serious.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.970
- Just--I guess we just
haven't said it out loud.

13:23.070 --> 13:26.373
And here I am saying it
to a man I hardly know

13:26.473 --> 13:28.075
while sawing down a tiny tree.

13:28.175 --> 13:31.078
- Hey, what happens at Simon
stays at Simon.

13:31.178 --> 13:34.447
- It's "Semen"!

13:34.547 --> 13:36.416
[both muttering]

13:39.052 --> 13:42.089
Oh, my God. It's fish.
- It's extremely moist fish.

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
- It's a fish tree.

13:43.623 --> 13:45.959
- There is nothing like
a drag audience.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.394
They can either cut
like a knife

13:47.494 --> 13:49.863
or lift you up
like a choir of angels.

13:49.963 --> 13:52.866
- Oh, God, I've never felt
more feminine or more loved.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.534
- Right?
- You know?

13:54.634 --> 13:55.535
- That's 'cause we're reversing
the curse, bitch.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.938
- Yeah, bitch!
- Whoo!

13:58.038 --> 13:59.940
- Hey, should we start
calling each other "bitch"?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.408
Are you on board for that?
- I don't know.

14:01.508 --> 14:02.542
I mean, it felt really good

14:02.642 --> 14:04.011
when I just said it
right there, but--

14:04.111 --> 14:05.445
- We wouldn't want
to do it at home.

14:05.545 --> 14:06.613
- No, no.
Not in front of Charlotte.

14:06.713 --> 14:07.981
- No, I wouldn't want
to be like,

14:08.081 --> 14:09.082
"Drink your bottle, bitch!"

14:09.182 --> 14:10.583
That doesn't sound right.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.419
- She's a baby.
- She's a baby, you dummy.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.022
- Hey, Tinas!
Roll on down the river.

14:15.122 --> 14:16.556
You're blocking my truck.

14:16.656 --> 14:19.559
- Rod Rockemoor!
As I live and breathe!

14:19.659 --> 14:21.929
- Maggie Caruso?
- Yes!

14:22.029 --> 14:23.496
- What are you doing here?

14:23.596 --> 14:26.066
I thought you were just some
old queen who wanted a chipwich.

14:26.166 --> 14:27.901
- No, Emma and I--
our car broke down,

14:28.001 --> 14:29.536
and one thing lead to another,
and we're doing drag.

14:29.636 --> 14:32.505
- We actually need a ride.
- Back away, you nasty queen.

14:32.605 --> 14:34.074
We got nothing frozen
for you here.

14:34.174 --> 14:36.643
- Oh, no. Rod, it's me, Emma.

14:36.743 --> 14:38.611
- I know,
and I don't like you.

14:38.711 --> 14:40.981
- [sighs]
- Please, Rod.

14:41.081 --> 14:43.083
I know this is crazy,
but will you give us a ride?

14:43.183 --> 14:44.918
I have a boyfriend.

14:45.018 --> 14:46.519
Ooh, ooh, ooh.
- No, no, no. Please don't.

14:46.619 --> 14:48.621
- What?
Girl, get in here.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.557
That's all you had to say.

14:50.657 --> 14:52.425
- Whoo!
- Not you!

14:59.466 --> 15:02.069
- So, Rod, how'd you end up
driving a truck.

15:02.669 --> 15:03.937
called "Yas Dairy Queens"?

15:05.205 --> 15:06.639
- You know, Maggie, after you
friendship broke up with me...

15:06.739 --> 15:09.076
- Sorry about that.
- It really opened my eyes

15:09.176 --> 15:12.679
that my UPS job was just
feeding my gossip obsession.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.949
- Can I have another King Cone?
- No!

15:16.049 --> 15:19.352
Anywho, what I realized
was that what I really loved

15:19.452 --> 15:22.222
about my job was trucks.
- Wow.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.224
- Yeah. I love driving trucks,
packing up trucks,

15:24.324 --> 15:25.625
taking stuff off trucks,

15:25.725 --> 15:27.360
wearing an outfit
that matches my truck.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.162
- Oh, my God.
This is so boring.

15:29.262 --> 15:31.231
- Oh, I'm sorry.

15:31.331 --> 15:34.134
What's going on in your life
that's so interesting?

15:34.234 --> 15:37.270
- I had cancer.
- Guh, talk about boring.

15:37.370 --> 15:38.972
- What?
- Hey.

15:39.072 --> 15:41.208
Y'all settle down, okay?
- [sighs]

15:41.308 --> 15:44.244
You know, I have to say,
it is nice to see

15:44.344 --> 15:46.980
you two connecting over
something other than gossip.

15:47.080 --> 15:49.016
- Ooh, which reminds me.
You're never gonna believe

15:49.116 --> 15:51.084
who came in the ER last week.
- No.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.253
- Yep.
both: Shirley Lambert!

15:53.353 --> 15:55.955
- She had four ingrown toenails.
- Maggie, you're not supposed

15:56.056 --> 15:57.690
to share private
medical information!

15:57.790 --> 15:59.426
- It's just her toes.
- It's because she's wearing

15:59.526 --> 16:01.028
those dirty flip-flops
all the time.

16:01.128 --> 16:03.130
And then putting them up
on a wreath.

16:03.230 --> 16:04.397
- Oh, God.
- You know, that abomination

16:04.497 --> 16:05.999
is still up on her door.

16:06.099 --> 16:07.667
- Wait, nine months after
the summer season?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.202
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh, my God.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.138
She lives around the corner.
We should do a drive-by.

16:11.238 --> 16:12.139
- A drive-by?
- Yeah.

16:12.239 --> 16:13.973
- What about Simon?

16:14.074 --> 16:15.742
I thought this whole night
has been about getting to Simon.

16:15.842 --> 16:18.745
- Come on, it's Shirley Lambert.
- And as Miley Cyrus says,

16:18.845 --> 16:22.149
it's not the destination...
both: It's the ride.

16:22.249 --> 16:25.052
- Ooh, are those Laffy Taffys?
- No, ma'am!

16:25.152 --> 16:26.453
- Ow.
- You got to cut

16:26.553 --> 16:28.288
this dead weight.
- You shouldn't say "dead."

16:28.388 --> 16:31.258
I had cancer.
- Oh, let it go!

16:38.298 --> 16:40.033
- There it is in all its glory.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.434
- "Better Homes and Gardens"
called.

16:41.534 --> 16:43.036
They want their idea back.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.072
- From 1982.

16:45.172 --> 16:46.773
- Okay, guys, this was fun,
but can we get a move on

16:46.873 --> 16:48.175
before someone sees us?

16:48.275 --> 16:49.276
I know we're reversing
the curse,

16:49.376 --> 16:51.144
but I don't want to push it.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.313
- I got to have that wreath.
- What are you talking about?

16:53.413 --> 16:55.148
- I don't know why,
but I got to have it.

16:55.248 --> 16:58.318
- Hey. Don't--
You are a mother

16:58.418 --> 17:00.753
and an upstanding member
of this community.

17:00.853 --> 17:03.090
What are you doing?
- I am getting crazy.

17:03.190 --> 17:05.325
I'm letting the rough end drag.
- We just performed

17:05.425 --> 17:06.493
as twin Tina Turners.

17:06.593 --> 17:08.195
Isn't that crazy enough?

17:08.295 --> 17:11.398
Oh, my God. It's hideous.
- I told you.

17:11.498 --> 17:13.333
- Please don't tell me
she wore those flip-flops.

17:13.433 --> 17:14.767
- Every last pair of 'em.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.269
- Oh, I'm gonna be sick.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.105
- Help me steal it.

17:18.205 --> 17:21.341
- [sighs] Fine.
Shh, shh, shh.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.144
[laughing quietly]

17:24.244 --> 17:25.545
- How does she
have this thing affixed?

17:25.645 --> 17:27.747
- Um, Shirley Lambert,
you ever heard of a wreath hook?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.048
[both laughing]

17:29.149 --> 17:30.350
Oh, God. Her toe jam's on me.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.818
Ew! Uh!
- Help me. Help me.

17:31.918 --> 17:33.453
[both yelp]

17:33.553 --> 17:35.222
[both laughing]

17:35.322 --> 17:37.557
- Oh, no! Toe jam!

17:37.657 --> 17:39.392
It's all over me.

17:39.492 --> 17:42.395
[snorting]
[both laughing]

17:44.431 --> 17:46.366
- I love you so much.

17:46.466 --> 17:47.500
- Oh, my God.
What's happening?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.102
Are you crying?

17:49.202 --> 17:50.370
Why? What?

17:50.470 --> 17:53.373
- I just--I'm having
a really good night,

17:53.473 --> 17:55.442
and I'm really glad
that you're alive

17:55.542 --> 17:57.544
so that we can do these
dumb adventures together,

17:57.644 --> 18:00.280
'cause I didn't know if we would
get to have anymore, you know?

18:00.380 --> 18:03.116
- Wait, were you really worried
I was gonna die?

18:03.216 --> 18:07.154
- Yeah, dummy. You had cancer.
Of course. I was terrified.

18:07.254 --> 18:11.224
- Get over here, you old queen
and give me some love.

18:11.324 --> 18:13.092
I love you so much.
- I love you.

18:13.193 --> 18:14.327
[ice cream truck music playing]
[gasps]

18:14.427 --> 18:15.862
Rod! Shut it off!

18:15.962 --> 18:17.864
- Rod, no!
- I don't know how!

18:17.964 --> 18:19.532
This is a new truck!

18:19.632 --> 18:21.100
Why is this happening?

18:21.201 --> 18:23.636
- Oh, God!
- [gasps] Go, go, go!

18:23.736 --> 18:25.505
Shirley alert.
- I got to get out of here.

18:25.605 --> 18:27.407
I can't go back to prison!

18:27.507 --> 18:30.810
- No, no, don't!
- Rod! Aah!

18:30.910 --> 18:32.812
Rod!
- No!

18:40.187 --> 18:43.856
[electronic music]

18:44.857 --> 18:46.726
- Congratulations.
You have reached Lift Off.

18:46.826 --> 18:48.795
- So, wait,
the last course is air, is it?

18:48.895 --> 18:53.700
- [chuckles] No, sillies.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.603
- Oh, cotton candy.
- It's "Semen"!

18:56.703 --> 18:58.638
- Ooh.
- He's got to stop saying that.

19:01.708 --> 19:04.544
- Enjoy.
- "Danyoy"?

19:04.644 --> 19:06.313
- Why is he so cross
all the time?

19:06.413 --> 19:07.580
- I don't know.
- He's just angry with us.

19:07.680 --> 19:08.681
What have we done?
[cell phone rings]

19:08.781 --> 19:10.550
- Oh. Hold on.
This is work.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.285
Oh, wait, wait. This is weird.
Check this out.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.555
I just got an APB saying
that two drag queens

19:15.655 --> 19:17.424
in an ice cream truck
just stole a wreath

19:17.524 --> 19:20.427
from Shirley Lambert's door.
- That is very specific.

19:20.527 --> 19:22.529
- [clears throat] Hello.
- Hello, friends.

19:22.629 --> 19:25.565
- Oh, no. Oh, no. Maggie.
- Yeah.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.600
- Are you all right?
- Feel--feeling great.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.402
- Sorry we're late.
- [clears throat]

19:29.502 --> 19:33.306
Did I just get
an APB on you two?

19:33.406 --> 19:34.741
- We're not speaking to anyone

19:34.841 --> 19:36.409
until we have
our lawyer present.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.910
- Okay.
- Also, you should know,

19:38.010 --> 19:41.714
a gentleman offered us $45...
- For the use of our bodies.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.883
- Wait a minute.
Were you soliciting sex, guys?

19:43.983 --> 19:45.718
- Come on.

19:45.818 --> 19:47.854
When have you ever gotten
offered money for your body?

19:47.954 --> 19:50.857
- That is not a lot of money.
- Can we leave?

19:50.957 --> 19:52.759
all:
Let's get out of here.

19:52.859 --> 19:54.461
- Wonderful.

19:54.561 --> 19:57.330
- [whispering] Aw, look at that
little peanut.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.932
- [whispering] Oh, my God.
You know, if she wakes up

20:00.032 --> 20:02.769
and sees us in these wigs,
she's gonna be scarred for life.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.537
- Terrified.

20:04.637 --> 20:06.906
- Oh, I just love her so much.
- Me too.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.676
Hey, when we tell her
the story about tonight,

20:09.776 --> 20:11.644
can we leave out the part--
- Oh, I'm absolutely telling her

20:11.744 --> 20:13.580
that you broke the law.
- Hey.

20:13.680 --> 20:15.415
- Don't try to censor me.
- Why don't we just tell her

20:15.515 --> 20:17.617
about how I fixed a flat tire
dressed as a man?

20:17.717 --> 20:19.386
- Don't tell me
how to tell my stories.

20:19.486 --> 20:20.887
- Okay, well, I know
you're gonna embellish it.

20:20.987 --> 20:21.988
- You know what?
This is the one time

20:22.088 --> 20:23.656
I don't have to embellish it

20:23.756 --> 20:25.558
'cause you're actually
that crazy.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.626
- You're the crazy one.
- No, you're the crazy one.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.760
- You are--
- No, no, hey!

20:27.860 --> 20:28.761
Don't drop a nail in that crib.

20:28.861 --> 20:31.864
- Shh. Shut up.
- Shut up.

20:31.964 --> 20:33.466
- I love you, baby girl.

20:33.566 --> 20:34.934
- Okay.
Night, night, Char-Bar.

20:35.034 --> 20:37.904
Your two crazy mamas love you.

20:38.004 --> 20:40.373
[smooches]
Okay.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.408
["Proud Mary" playing]

20:41.508 --> 20:42.642
- 'Cause we're rolling.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.377
- * Said we're rolling *

20:44.477 --> 20:46.646
- * Rolling
- * Rolling

20:46.746 --> 20:51.518
- * Rolling
- * Rolling on the river

20:51.618 --> 20:56.489
- * Rolling on the river
