- When you wake up Christmas
- morning, we'll be there.

17:31.259 --> 17:33.283
And meantime, Jessie

17:33.284 --> 17:35.305
and Bertram are gonna

17:31.259 --> 17:35.305
make this

17:35.430 --> 17:36.932
the best Christmas

17:36.933 --> 17:38.433
ever, right guys?

17:38.558 --> 17:40.853
Right! Ho, ho, ho!

17:40.854 --> 17:43.146
Right! The best ever.

17:43.271 --> 17:45.462
Kids, gather by the fire,

17:45.463 --> 17:47.651
and Daddy and I will read you

17:43.271 --> 17:47.651
The Night Before Christmas.

17:47.776 --> 17:48.776
Yeah, let's go.

17:49.987 --> 17:51.239
I hope the evil Santa

17:51.240 --> 17:52.489
is not in that story.

17:55.867 --> 17:57.349
We're lucky Morgan and

17:57.350 --> 17:58.829
Christina had these presents

17:55.867 --> 17:58.829
in their regifting closet.

17:58.954 --> 18:00.014
- That bike will be
- perfect for Ravi.

18:00.038 --> 18:01.373
Only if he likes

18:01.374 --> 18:02.707
peddling in place.

18:02.833 --> 18:05.168
This is a stationary bike!

18:05.209 --> 18:06.353
- He just came - all the way
- From India.

18:06.377 --> 18:07.442
He doesn't need

18:07.443 --> 18:08.505
to go anywhere else.

18:08.630 --> 18:11.591
Meanwhile, this mushroom

18:11.592 --> 18:14.552
extract will be perfect

18:08.630 --> 18:14.552
for Zuri's laugh lines.

18:14.678 --> 18:16.097
You can't put anti-aging

18:16.098 --> 18:17.514
make-up on a 7-year-old.

18:14.678 --> 18:17.514
She'll disappear!

18:18.890 --> 18:20.622
Fine, then we will give

18:20.623 --> 18:22.352
Zuri the canned ham,

18:22.477 --> 18:24.117
- Luke the laser hair
- removal session...

18:24.187 --> 18:25.918
You really want to put Luke

18:25.919 --> 18:27.649
in the same room with a laser?

18:27.774 --> 18:29.235
Good lookin' out.

18:29.236 --> 18:30.694
Yeah, we'll give

18:27.774 --> 18:30.694
this to Emma.

18:30.819 --> 18:32.154
She's starting

18:32.155 --> 18:33.488
to get a unibrow.

18:33.613 --> 18:35.933
- Okay, grab your beard, - and
let's go take - Some photos.

18:38.201 --> 18:40.328
Why do I have

18:40.329 --> 18:42.455
to do this?

18:42.580 --> 18:43.999
So Ravi sees that

18:44.000 --> 18:45.416
Santa is a good guy,

18:42.580 --> 18:45.416
and not a creepy stalker.

18:47.251 --> 18:48.836
Now smile!

18:48.837 --> 18:50.421
Ho, ho, ho.

18:50.547 --> 18:51.882
Oh, come on.

18:51.883 --> 18:53.216
Show me the jolly!

18:53.257 --> 18:55.009
I'm trying, but this beard

18:55.010 --> 18:56.761
is itchy and these pants

18:53.257 --> 18:56.761
smell like reindeer pee.

19:00.223 --> 19:00.891
Ow! Ow! My hair!

19:01.016 --> 19:02.767
Oh! Oh! Oh!

19:03.643 --> 19:04.936
- Ow!
- Hey!

19:05.062 --> 19:06.813
- Don't move! - That hurts!
- Stop!

19:06.938 --> 19:08.169
Don't move!

19:08.170 --> 19:09.399
Stop! Stop! Stop!

19:09.524 --> 19:10.734
- Don't move!
- Hey!

19:10.859 --> 19:12.173
Let her go,

19:12.174 --> 19:13.486
you bearded brute!

19:10.859 --> 19:13.486
(SCREAMS)

19:15.864 --> 19:16.864
(BOTH SCREAMING)

19:18.658 --> 19:19.367
- This is how
- we do it in Calcutta!

19:19.492 --> 19:21.411
- Ravi! Ravi!
- Stop! Quit!

19:23.246 --> 19:24.247
Stop it!

19:25.790 --> 19:27.334
Ravi! You're

19:27.335 --> 19:28.877
beating Santa!

19:29.002 --> 19:30.803
- With something that
- says "peace on Earth."

19:31.922 --> 19:34.759
Yes, keep crawling like

19:34.760 --> 19:37.594
the insect you are!

19:37.719 --> 19:39.993
Ravi, thank you

19:39.994 --> 19:42.265
so much, but Santa

19:37.719 --> 19:42.265
wasn't hurting me.

19:42.306 --> 19:43.641
- An innocent man
- does not run.

19:45.435 --> 19:46.916
What is all

19:46.917 --> 19:48.396
the racket?

19:48.521 --> 19:50.148
- Are Mom
- and Dad here?

19:50.314 --> 19:51.899
(SIGHS) No, guys,

19:51.900 --> 19:53.484
you know they wish

19:50.314 --> 19:53.484
they could be here,

19:53.610 --> 19:55.130
- but they can't
- control the weather.

19:55.278 --> 19:57.343
All we wanted was

19:57.344 --> 19:59.407
to have Mommy

19:55.278 --> 19:59.407
and Daddy home.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.243
I wouldn't say "all,"

20:01.244 --> 20:02.953
because Mortal Terror 5

19:59.532 --> 20:02.953
just came out,

20:03.078 --> 20:04.163
but it was still

20:04.164 --> 20:05.246
really important!

20:05.371 --> 20:08.332
(ALL CRYING)

20:08.458 --> 20:10.210
Guys, guys, please don't cry!

20:10.211 --> 20:11.962
We can still have

20:08.458 --> 20:11.962
a fun Christmas.

20:12.087 --> 20:13.254
Look, Zuri!

20:14.756 --> 20:16.466
A ham!

20:18.509 --> 20:19.553
Can you put

20:19.554 --> 20:20.595
sprinkles on it?

20:20.720 --> 20:21.910
Of course. I can do

20:21.911 --> 20:23.098
anything you want.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.579
Can you make Mommy

20:24.580 --> 20:25.934
and Daddy appear?

20:26.059 --> 20:27.853
Oh, trust me, guys,

20:27.854 --> 20:29.646
if I could, they'd walk out

20:26.059 --> 20:29.646
of that elevator right now.

20:31.439 --> 20:32.899
BOTH: Merry Christmas!

20:34.651 --> 20:36.111
Thanks, Jessie!

20:36.112 --> 20:37.570
Now turn Luke

20:34.651 --> 20:37.570
into a pony!

20:39.739 --> 20:41.408
Guys, I thought

20:41.409 --> 20:43.076
the trains were stopped.

20:39.739 --> 20:43.076
How did you make it home?

20:43.201 --> 20:44.974
Mommy and Daddy ran into

20:44.975 --> 20:46.746
Santa Claus, and he gave us

20:43.201 --> 20:46.746
a ride home in his sleigh.

20:46.871 --> 20:47.956
He did?

20:47.957 --> 20:49.040
CHRISTINA: Absolutely.

20:49.166 --> 20:50.750
- And he even
- let me steer!

20:50.875 --> 20:53.419
CHRISTINA: He was so nice!

20:53.544 --> 20:55.693
Well, now I feel terrible,

20:55.694 --> 20:57.841
because I just beat

20:53.544 --> 20:57.841
the curry out of him.

21:03.054 --> 21:04.931
- (PIANO PLAYING
- CHRISTMAS MUSIC)

21:07.851 --> 21:09.603
RAVI: Mr. Kipling loves

21:09.604 --> 21:11.354
his new antlers.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.557
- You are a cute - little rein-lizard.
- Yes, you are.

21:15.483 --> 21:17.735
Ooh, a new phone!

21:18.820 --> 21:20.404
Cut! Love it!

21:20.530 --> 21:21.841
- Okay, sweetheart,
- that was great.

21:21.865 --> 21:23.785
- Let's try one more
- with a little more energy.

21:26.619 --> 21:28.747
Ooh! A new phone!

21:28.748 --> 21:30.874
(SHRIEKING) I love it!

21:30.999 --> 21:32.563
We'll go with

21:32.564 --> 21:34.127
the first one.

21:30.999 --> 21:34.127
I'll fix it in post.

21:36.171 --> 21:38.131
You're my new best friend.

21:39.674 --> 21:40.674
Next to Hammy.

21:43.427 --> 21:45.055
Okay, guys, I want to take

21:45.056 --> 21:46.681
a picture by the tree.

21:46.806 --> 21:48.162
Oh, and by the way,

21:48.163 --> 21:49.517
I love that the strings

21:49.642 --> 21:50.956
are popcorn, popcorn,

21:50.957 --> 21:52.270
cranberry, popcorn.

21:52.395 --> 21:54.043
I told you! I'm so glad

21:54.044 --> 21:55.690
someone appreciates

21:52.395 --> 21:55.690
my popcorn pattern.

21:59.861 --> 22:01.051
Wait a minute.

22:01.052 --> 22:02.239
Where is Jessie?

22:02.405 --> 22:04.175
- Yeah, she needs - to be in the family
- Picture, too.

22:04.199 --> 22:05.408
(JESSIE SNORING)

22:05.533 --> 22:06.534
ZURI: Yeah.

22:09.412 --> 22:10.705
All right, everybody

22:10.706 --> 22:11.998
gather around Jessie.

22:12.123 --> 22:13.417
Aw, she looks

22:13.418 --> 22:14.709
so cute.

22:14.834 --> 22:16.294
Aw, she's drooling.

22:17.545 --> 22:18.546
That makes two of us.

22:20.924 --> 22:22.633
- Everybody, say
- "Jessie."

22:22.759 --> 22:24.219
ALL: Jessie!

22:24.427 --> 22:25.428
Huh?
