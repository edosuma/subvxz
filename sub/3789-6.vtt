01:11.280 --> 01:13.865
Okay, wait for it, wait.

01:13.949 --> 01:15.450
Bam!

01:16.368 --> 01:19.996
Get two peas and a biscuit and bang!

01:20.080 --> 01:21.247
Left hook, bitch.

01:21.331 --> 01:22.915
Don't even think about getting up.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.668
Why don't you go home
with your mind intact, brother?

01:25.753 --> 01:28.087
If you can't handle the trash talk,
learn how to jab.

01:28.172 --> 01:29.213
Then you won't have to hear it.

01:29.631 --> 01:32.341
You know what?
Go cry to your trainer. We're done.

01:32.468 --> 01:34.093
Who are you talking to?

01:34.178 --> 01:36.345
Just some tool in Iowa
who clearly can't handle my skills.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.181
Oh, Jesus, what? You've been up all night?

01:38.265 --> 01:40.850
You know it. Gotta train.
Somebody's got to earn us some money.

01:40.976 --> 01:42.518
Oh, yeah, that's right. The Xbox tournament.

01:42.603 --> 01:45.021
That 10 grand should really
keep us in diamonds and furs.

01:45.105 --> 01:47.690
Yo, Vince, he's messing up my training.

01:47.775 --> 01:49.442
What are you doing, E?

01:49.526 --> 01:51.861
Don't mess with his head.
Guy's my top earner.

01:51.945 --> 01:55.198
Hey, I'm gonna be contributing
to the pot, too. Vince, tell these guys.

01:55.282 --> 01:57.408
All right, you tell them your plan, Johnny.

01:57.493 --> 01:59.702
I measured my room. It's 600 square feet.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.412
That's 10% of the home.

02:01.497 --> 02:03.873
Now the mortgage costs $24,000 a month.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.167
I'm gonna pay $2,400 a month

02:06.251 --> 02:08.252
and I'm gonna own 10% of the house.

02:08.336 --> 02:10.045
Where are you gonna get
$2,400 a month, Johnny?

02:10.130 --> 02:12.298
What, do you think I cook for free?

02:12.716 --> 02:15.510
Okay, so Johnny's got his plan.

02:15.594 --> 02:19.305
Turtle's got a plan.
What's your plan, Manager?

02:19.389 --> 02:21.098
I'm working on some things, Vince.

02:21.183 --> 02:23.976
You may wanna work on calling Emily back.
She left three messages.

02:24.061 --> 02:25.603
What am I gonna say, "I'm an idiot"?

02:25.687 --> 02:28.147
"I shouldn't have promised you
the print of a movie I can't get"?

02:28.232 --> 02:29.649
I like the idiot part.

02:29.733 --> 02:31.901
Why don't you call Walsh?

02:31.985 --> 02:34.654
Ah, see, here's the thing
you don't seem to be grasping.

02:34.738 --> 02:37.448
- I don't make the calls.
- He don't make the calls.

02:37.533 --> 02:39.242
- I make the movies.
- He's the movie star.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.495
And I make the money, or at least I used to.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.288
Till he hired this guy.

02:44.373 --> 02:47.375
- You wanted to hire me yesterday.
- That was yesterday, bro.

02:48.544 --> 02:49.836
I'll make some calls.

02:49.920 --> 02:52.630
Hey, the manager's working.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.175
Go get 'em!

02:56.260 --> 02:57.802
Eric, do not fear.

02:57.886 --> 03:00.179
I got my top lieutenants meeting me
in the war room in 10 minutes.

03:00.264 --> 03:02.306
Ari, I'm getting killed over here.
Vince isn't happy.

03:02.391 --> 03:05.268
Course he's not happy. Nobody's happy
in this town except for the losers.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.144
Look at me, I'm miserable, that's why I'm rich.

03:07.229 --> 03:09.355
Cut the bullshit, Ari. I'm serious.
Vince needs a job.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.233
Sounds like you might, too.
I tell you what, Domino's is hiring.

03:12.317 --> 03:14.527
Why don't you put that little pizza sign
on top of your Maserati?

03:14.611 --> 03:15.778
Now that is comedy.

03:15.863 --> 03:18.531
Getting dragged through your office
in front of your entire staff

03:18.615 --> 03:21.367
by a guy half your size, now that's tragedy.

03:28.917 --> 03:31.460
Okay, people, cancel your lunches.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.629
We are going to close The Ivy today,

03:33.714 --> 03:36.799
'cause no one is leaving this room
until we score a big payday

03:36.884 --> 03:39.802
for my boy Vinnie Chase.
Who wants to be a hero?

03:39.887 --> 03:41.220
Liz?

03:41.305 --> 03:43.139
David E. Kelley's got a terrific new pilot.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.682
Television?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.768
Lots of movie stars are doing TV now, Ari.
Gary Sinise...

03:47.853 --> 03:50.897
Well, when Vince looks like Gary Sinise,
he'll do television.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.565
Peter Gallagher, Anthony LaPaglia...

03:52.649 --> 03:53.774
Get out.

03:55.986 --> 03:58.571
Seriously, get the fuck out.

03:58.655 --> 04:02.074
Don't even grab a bagel. Next!

04:10.000 --> 04:12.585
- Davies, what've you got?
- Tobey just fell out of something.

04:12.669 --> 04:14.962
Could probably get Vince
half what they were gonna give him.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.882
All right, that is what I'm talking about.

04:17.966 --> 04:21.385
You, my friend,
deserve some very expensive lox.

04:21.470 --> 04:24.513
Would you tell Mr. Wick
that Eric Murphy called again?

04:24.598 --> 04:27.016
Murphy, M-U-R-P-H-Y.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.310
Yeah, I'm Vincent Chase's manager.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.395
Look how puffy his eyes are.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.940
Damn, I'm telling him
to get more power on my hooks.

04:34.024 --> 04:35.191
Check this out.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.943
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

04:37.027 --> 04:39.111
Oh, I think you knocked his molar out.
Look at this.

04:39.196 --> 04:41.280
If only life came with a joystick, huh, Turtle?

04:41.365 --> 04:42.615
Yeah, I know.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.117
- Anything?
- They won't call me back.

04:45.202 --> 04:47.453
It's like they don't believe I'm your manager.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.996
We don't believe it. Why should they?

04:50.582 --> 04:52.959
I do like the action
you're gettin' off this thing.

04:53.043 --> 04:55.002
I know, it's like I'm superhuman.

04:55.087 --> 04:58.506
I know 250 bucks is a lot to spend
on a controller, but you know what?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.299
Fuck it, it's a tax deduction, right?

05:00.384 --> 05:02.218
You have to have an income
to have a tax deduction.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.928
Where's Vince's income, player?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.763
This controller, a bag of crip weed

05:05.847 --> 05:07.890
and I'm walking away with the belt.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.935
Turtle, about the weed,
I forgot to tell you.

05:11.019 --> 05:12.770
I spoke to Scott over at EA.

05:12.854 --> 05:15.564
He says this year at the tournament
they're drug-testing people.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.066
- That's funny.
I'm dead serious.

05:17.234 --> 05:18.943
And don't embarrass me.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.987
I don't want them taking me
off the players' club list.

05:21.071 --> 05:22.697
Are you fucking with me?

05:22.781 --> 05:24.573
Turtle, I got no money, I got no job,

05:24.658 --> 05:26.659
I don't have the energy
to be fucking with you.

05:28.745 --> 05:31.664
Don't fuck around.

05:31.748 --> 05:32.999
Hey, Ari.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.084
Eric, I got the cash you wanted.

05:35.168 --> 05:38.212
Yeah? Did you dust off your tranny gear
and hit Santa Monica Blvd?

05:38.296 --> 05:40.506
That's not bad.
Meet me at Urth Cafe in 20 minutes.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.508
- I'm with Vince.
- Perfect, he'll love this.

05:42.592 --> 05:44.927
- Mike Hyer's on line three!
- Does it look like I'm here?

05:45.012 --> 05:48.264
- We got a gig.
- What kind of gig?

05:48.348 --> 05:50.599
Chaing Chung.

05:52.060 --> 05:55.521
- What?
- Chaing Chung.

05:55.605 --> 05:58.024
Do you know what he's talking about?

05:58.108 --> 05:59.859
No. What the fuck are you saying, Ari?

05:59.943 --> 06:02.361
Chaing Chung is the hottest
director in Hong Kong.

06:02.446 --> 06:05.865
Tarantino has already decided he's
the next guy he wants to steal from.

06:05.949 --> 06:08.617
Cool, the guy must be good.
Tarantino only steals from the best.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.411
- That's right, baby.
- So what's the movie?

06:10.495 --> 06:12.246
Not a movie.

06:12.330 --> 06:15.041
- What is it? Is it a TV show?
- No.

06:15.125 --> 06:18.586
Let me guess. Does it rhyme with...
What the fuck is it, Ari?

06:18.670 --> 06:20.504
- Tell us.
- It's a commercial.

06:21.131 --> 06:23.507
If you can't protect yourself,

06:23.633 --> 06:25.217
the referee has to do it for you.

06:25.302 --> 06:27.720
You're dropping your guard.
You're dropping your guard.

06:27.804 --> 06:29.555
I can't play when I'm not stoned.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.891
Well, smoke a joint then,
'cause you can't win like this.

06:31.975 --> 06:33.851
You heard Vince, I gotta be drug-tested.

06:33.977 --> 06:36.562
Weed stays in your system for 30 days.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.523
Nobody says you've got to quit smoking.

06:39.608 --> 06:42.526
You just got to find
yourself some clean urine.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.904
It's the Chinese motherfucking Red Bull.

06:44.988 --> 06:47.448
They guzzle it over there. It's on every corner.

06:47.532 --> 06:49.617
I can't believe you want me
to do a commercial.

06:49.701 --> 06:52.411
Ari, I started in this
business peddling Mentos.

06:52.496 --> 06:54.080
I don't wanna go back.

06:54.164 --> 06:57.458
Vinnie, all the big shots, all of them,
do foreign commercials.

06:57.542 --> 07:01.212
You think L. Ron pays
for Travolta's planes? Please!

07:01.296 --> 07:05.591
Big John has been pumping
the Japs full of Sanka for years.

07:05.675 --> 07:08.094
Ari, come on, my grandfather is Japanese.

07:08.178 --> 07:09.929
What I say, Japs? Is that derogatory?

07:10.013 --> 07:11.680
If you call Wick, set up a screening...

07:11.765 --> 07:13.557
Are you kidding me? I'm not gonna call Wick

07:13.642 --> 07:15.351
because I do not want
James Cameron to see the movie.

07:15.477 --> 07:18.729
I'm still working on getting
the meeting back that you fucked up.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.689
You let Rumpelstiltskin run your career.

07:20.774 --> 07:22.525
Oh, like you're doing so fucking great, Ari?

07:22.609 --> 07:25.778
I mean, you promised the guy a statue,
I guess you meant the CLIO, right?

07:25.862 --> 07:27.822
Ari, I don't want to do a commercial.

07:27.906 --> 07:30.908
Vinnie, it will never appear
on U.S. Soil, all right?

07:30.992 --> 07:32.952
It is one day's work.

07:33.036 --> 07:34.370
He said he doesn't wanna do a commercial.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.746
For half a million dollars.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.167
What was the director's name again?

07:40.252 --> 07:43.504
Cha-ching! I'm sorry, Chaing Chung, boom!

07:43.588 --> 07:46.173
Five hundred grand a day?

07:46.258 --> 07:48.717
We should do 100 of these a year.
That's 50 million.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.636
Take the other 265 days off.

07:50.720 --> 07:52.805
That's better than a teacher's schedule.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.182
What do you think, E?
No more movies, no more critics.

07:55.267 --> 07:58.310
Why be a movie star when you can be
an international spokesperson?

07:58.395 --> 08:01.564
Yeah, I remember
my first national commercial.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.190
Oh, what was that, Valtrex?

08:03.275 --> 08:05.651
Yeah, it was, so fucking what?

08:05.735 --> 08:07.361
It got me my Fiat.

08:07.445 --> 08:10.614
Plus I got a blow job from
the makeup girl putting my sores on.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.117
- That's nice.
- I wanna live in China.

08:13.201 --> 08:16.453
Hey, Vince, why don't we replace Olga
with one of these hot geisha girls?

08:16.538 --> 08:19.165
Geisha girls are from Japan, jackass.

08:19.249 --> 08:22.168
My point is we should have
a hot cleaning lady who fucks.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.587
- Then she'd be a hooker.
- Yeah, a hooker who cleans.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.509
Oh, fuck, it's Emily again.

08:30.594 --> 08:32.219
You can run, but you can't hide.

08:32.304 --> 08:34.096
I'm stalling till Wick calls me back.

08:34.181 --> 08:37.015
No, I hate it when people tell me
they can't get my agent on the phone.

08:37.100 --> 08:40.352
Don't let me start hearing about
my manager, too. Answer the phone.

08:40.437 --> 08:42.270
No, you know what? I'll take it.

08:42.355 --> 08:45.107
Come on, I'll tell her
you're immersed in meetings.

08:46.651 --> 08:48.986
- Emily.
- Vince, hi.

08:49.070 --> 08:51.197
- Hi, how are you?
- Good.

08:51.281 --> 08:53.032
Oh, my God, wait... No, stop!

08:53.116 --> 08:56.619
Stop! He's trying to rip the phone
from my hands, can you believe it?

08:56.703 --> 09:00.414
Oh, Jesus, relax! God! Oh, take it.

09:00.498 --> 09:02.541
Hey, Emily.

09:02.626 --> 09:05.544
Eric, do not make like you haven't
got my last 20 messages.

09:05.629 --> 09:08.505
Well, I'm having a hard time getting the print.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.799
What you mean?
How hard can it be to get a print of a movie?

09:10.884 --> 09:12.468
The director is a bit of an egomaniac.

09:12.552 --> 09:14.887
Does he know James Cameron
wants to see his movie?

09:14.971 --> 09:16.555
Yeah, that didn't really impress him.

09:16.640 --> 09:19.099
Eric, I cleared James' whole schedule for this.

09:19.184 --> 09:21.018
Don't make me look like an asshole.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.520
If you can't get it to me,
let me know as soon as possible.

09:23.605 --> 09:25.564
Okay.

09:25.649 --> 09:27.191
Mr. Chase?

09:27.275 --> 09:30.778
I'm Li Lei, Mr. Chung's technical advisor.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.821
Yeah, Li Lei, you did all the fight sequences

09:32.906 --> 09:35.908
in Lau and Mak's Infernal Affairs.
Those scenes were amazing.

09:35.992 --> 09:38.369
Wait till you see what Mr. Chung
has in store for you,

09:38.453 --> 09:41.247
even more amazing. Follow me this way.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.500
Trying to tell me you wouldn't want her

09:44.584 --> 09:47.127
technically advising us
on how to clean the house?

10:00.016 --> 10:02.726
Chung's vision is based firmly in wu xia pian.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.311
But he will incorporate kung fu

10:04.396 --> 10:07.564
as an homage to Chinese new wave cinema.
A sort of wire fu.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.237
He will draw from Chinese mythology

10:13.321 --> 10:15.823
and esoteric aspects of the martial art.

10:21.329 --> 10:24.039
Chung sees you as an heroic knight

10:24.124 --> 10:26.875
fighting to uphold justice in a mystical realm

10:26.960 --> 10:30.296
where you fight powerful clans
of villains who dominate society

10:30.380 --> 10:32.131
and vie for control of the martial world.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.633
It will include swordplay, flying,

10:34.718 --> 10:36.802
magic and weapons.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.764
Chung wants to know if you've ever seen

10:40.849 --> 10:42.308
Chinese Ghost Story or Swordsman.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.060
Yeah, tell him Tsui Hark
is one of my favorites.

10:51.026 --> 10:54.069
Now imagine Tsui Hark
on three bottles of Red Bull.

10:55.947 --> 10:58.532
Very exciting stuff.

10:58.616 --> 11:01.535
Now we drink. Cheers!

11:01.619 --> 11:04.496
As long as the interpreter
wasn't making up her own stuff,

11:04.581 --> 11:07.541
- this guy's got an interesting vision.
- I think it sounds amazing.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.002
Maybe we should hook up
with this guy after and do a movie.

11:10.086 --> 11:11.670
Now you're talking. That's a good idea.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.841
Does his vision include any roles
for anyone else who might need a role?

11:15.925 --> 11:18.260
Johnny, you know I always take care of you.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.220
- Yeah, our man.
- Yeah!

11:20.305 --> 11:22.139
Hey, Vince, Chaing loved you.

11:22.223 --> 11:24.016
- He's very excited.
- Oh, great.

11:24.100 --> 11:26.685
He wants you and I
to get together immediately

11:26.770 --> 11:28.520
so I can work you through some moves.

11:28.605 --> 11:29.897
Yeah, I taught him a few things.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.815
Brandon Lee and I used to train together.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.442
In fact, I had a small part in The Crow.

11:33.526 --> 11:35.027
Yeah, he was the bird.

11:35.111 --> 11:38.364
The Lee clan practically adopted me.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.033
Me and Brandon used to go
to Mandarette twice a week.

11:41.117 --> 11:44.703
Why don't you meet me at gym today?

11:44.788 --> 11:47.706
Bring your friends. I show them moves, too.

11:47.791 --> 11:50.417
Sounds good.

11:52.128 --> 11:56.006
- She's very dominating.
- I know, I like it.

11:56.341 --> 11:59.259
You really gonna wear that color
like you earned it, huh?

11:59.344 --> 12:01.428
What are you talking about? I earned this belt.

12:01.513 --> 12:03.055
In fact, I went as high as a green.

12:03.139 --> 12:05.808
I just like to wear the yellow
cause it makes my eyes pop.

12:05.892 --> 12:07.393
Any luck with Wick?

12:07.477 --> 12:09.269
I finally got his secretary
to tell me he's at home.

12:09.354 --> 12:12.064
- Headed over there right now.
- Aggressive, I like that.

12:12.148 --> 12:13.982
Hey, if you were as hot as Li
I might go with you.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.734
Come on, Turtle, let's go.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.612
Vince, if you don't mind, as much
as I'd like to see Li Lei sweating,

12:18.696 --> 12:21.990
I gotta pass on the gym.
Hack's got me a lead on some clean urine.

12:22.075 --> 12:25.702
I'll explain it later, bro. You're gonna love it.

12:25.787 --> 12:27.621
Looks like it's just you and me, bro,

12:27.705 --> 12:30.624
just like the old days
before these jerkoffs were around.

12:30.708 --> 12:33.252
He's dropping bombs on his opponent.

12:33.336 --> 12:35.671
I see you in 'em hot-ass shorts
you've got on.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.549
Oh, shit, oh!

12:38.633 --> 12:40.926
You're getting kind of good at this shit, huh?

12:41.010 --> 12:42.928
Good? You're a heavyweight,

12:43.012 --> 12:45.639
I'm beating your ass
with a 110-Ib. Filipino, bitch.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.434
Don't get cocky, motherfucker,
I'll beat your ass in real life.

12:48.518 --> 12:51.145
I got the high score in that shit.

12:51.229 --> 12:54.773
Hey, yo, Brandon, watch
your little fleshy pisser, motherfucker.

12:54.858 --> 12:58.026
I don't want you to get a drop of piss
on my imported Italian marble.

12:58.111 --> 13:00.112
Oh, you're down, baby.

13:00.196 --> 13:02.739
It's over! Don't even bother getting up.

13:07.704 --> 13:11.373
Hi, Eric Murphy. Is your dad home?

13:11.458 --> 13:13.584
My dad?

13:13.668 --> 13:16.003
My dad lives in Tennessee.

13:16.087 --> 13:19.923
You must be looking for my daddy.
Come in, he's at the pool.

13:29.559 --> 13:33.270
Yo! Nunchucks, bro! It's been a while.

13:33.354 --> 13:35.939
See if I still got it.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.825
I see you have had some training.

13:46.910 --> 13:48.785
Yeah, I wasn't bullshitting you.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.997
- How 'bout you, Vince?
- I'm a blank canvas.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.790
I'm a little more athletic than Vince,

13:53.875 --> 13:56.835
so you might wanna
demonstrate stuff on me first.

13:56.920 --> 14:00.214
So you're the athlete
in the family, huh, Johnny?

14:00.298 --> 14:03.467
Athlete with a nice yellow belt.

14:03.551 --> 14:06.428
I see so many Americans wearing these belts

14:06.513 --> 14:08.430
and yet they do not earn the level.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.184
What are you saying?

14:12.268 --> 14:14.436
Nothing.

14:14.521 --> 14:18.857
It is just in true kung fu,
we never show duan wei with belt.

14:18.942 --> 14:20.734
It is not Chinese way.

14:20.818 --> 14:23.320
So what is the Chinese way?

14:26.658 --> 14:29.618
This golden dragon stands forjinlong,

14:29.702 --> 14:31.870
ninth level, the highest level.

14:31.955 --> 14:35.958
Well look, little Lei Lu, I earned this level.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.710
And for your information, we're in America.

14:38.795 --> 14:42.381
Okay, so do you want we spar a little?

14:42.465 --> 14:45.217
Warm up? Show Vince your moves?

14:47.762 --> 14:49.096
No.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.223
Oh, come on, I wanna see your athleticism.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.725
No, Vince, I'm not beating up a girl.

14:53.810 --> 14:56.853
Only girl in the room is
the one wearing pretty yellow belt.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.564
You calling me a girl?

14:58.648 --> 15:00.732
If the belt fits.

15:00.817 --> 15:04.027
Don't say I didn't warn you.

15:07.657 --> 15:09.575
Oh, you want some of that?

15:09.659 --> 15:13.412
What if I was to do
a little something like this, huh?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.332
What if I was to do a little
something like that?

15:20.295 --> 15:23.171
Okay, you wanna play hardball, huh?

15:24.882 --> 15:27.426
You want some of this, huh?

15:27.510 --> 15:30.804
Go get her, Johnny, come on.

15:42.525 --> 15:44.484
Good athleticism, Johnny.

15:44.569 --> 15:46.903
I work with Vince now.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.781
You go next door, get dim sum.

15:51.034 --> 15:53.869
Yeah, dim sum, that's a good idea.

15:53.953 --> 15:56.246
My blood sugar is kind of low.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.291
You know, I didn't have any breakfast
this morning, right?

15:59.375 --> 16:01.501
- Take it easy.
- I'll see you later.

16:04.881 --> 16:07.591
You think you can do that to me?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.480
No, you do it to me.

16:21.564 --> 16:24.024
We need you to look like the expert.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.834
If you want to be hard as iron,

16:42.919 --> 16:47.381
you must first master laying horse stance.

16:47.465 --> 16:50.217
Yes, ma'am.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.843
Sorry about the son comment.

16:51.928 --> 16:54.054
Oh, don't worry about that.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.723
You know, he still might be my son yet.

16:56.808 --> 16:59.685
I can adopt him, I just can't marry him.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.605
Great country, right?

17:03.690 --> 17:05.482
So, Eric, what's up?

17:05.566 --> 17:07.526
You know Vince is up for Aquaman, right?

17:07.609 --> 17:09.277
Mmm. It's a great script.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.530
I passed on it
the first time around, you know?

17:11.614 --> 17:13.740
And now that Cameron's doing it,

17:13.825 --> 17:15.659
don't I look like the fool?

17:15.742 --> 17:17.577
Anyway I promised him
a print of Queens Boulevard,

17:17.662 --> 17:19.121
but Walsh won't give me one.

17:19.204 --> 17:21.790
Oh, that Walsh, he's such a brazen bastard.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.041
He's a very tough guy to talk to.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.795
Will you talk to him for me? For Vince?

17:28.923 --> 17:31.383
Vince isn't here.

17:31.467 --> 17:32.801
But you are.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.887
So if I do this for you,

17:35.972 --> 17:39.641
my scrumptious little Irishman,

17:39.726 --> 17:41.768
what're you gonna do for me?

17:44.439 --> 17:48.108
I am fucking with you.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.819
God, you should've seen yourself.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.448
Anyway, yes, I will call. I will call.

17:57.368 --> 18:01.788
- What position is this?
- I just invented it.

18:01.873 --> 18:04.708
Do you think Chaing will let us
use this in the commercial?

18:04.792 --> 18:07.502
He may. He's very creative.

18:10.465 --> 18:12.174
No problem.

18:21.184 --> 18:23.018
All right, let's get this over with.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.519
Where do I take the piss test?

18:24.604 --> 18:26.271
- The what?
- The drug test.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.107
I drank three bottles of water
in the car for this,

18:29.192 --> 18:31.234
so could we just get this over with, please?

18:31.319 --> 18:33.653
This is Xbox, loser, not the Olympics.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.448
We don't give drug tests.
If we did, we'd be out of business, idiot.

18:36.532 --> 18:38.700
- Sucker!
- They got you, Turtle.

18:40.995 --> 18:43.538
- What the fuck do I do with this now?
- Drink it.

18:47.418 --> 18:50.504
You're not so tough now, huh?

18:50.588 --> 18:52.255
Those games are fucking bullshit.

18:52.340 --> 18:54.633
Calm down, Li.

18:56.177 --> 18:58.553
I can't believe they put me up
against a little kid.

18:58.638 --> 19:01.056
- I don't know, he looks pretty tough.
He's right.

19:01.140 --> 19:04.100
Don't get overconfident.
You've got to respect your opponent.

19:04.185 --> 19:07.312
I want you to go over there, look
the kid in the eyes and say good luck.

19:07.396 --> 19:09.815
- It'll shake 'em.
- All right.

19:09.899 --> 19:11.900
Good luck, Turtle.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.826
It looks like it's me and you
in the first round, kid.

19:20.910 --> 19:22.911
I just wanna wish you good luck.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.621
Yeah, you, too, fat boy.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.459
Little wise-ass.

19:32.797 --> 19:34.172
Hey.

19:34.257 --> 19:37.175
Eric, I tried. I tried, but...

19:37.260 --> 19:39.553
Walsh is a Neanderthal.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.180
- You look very nice.
- What'd he say?

19:42.265 --> 19:44.599
He said that I should go fuck my mother.

19:44.684 --> 19:47.811
He says it's his movie.
His movie! Can you believe that?

19:47.895 --> 19:50.689
Oh, I swear to Christ,

19:50.773 --> 19:53.900
if this movie isn't genius,
I'm gonna have him killed.

19:53.985 --> 19:56.570
What are you talking about?
You can't get the print of your own movie.

19:56.654 --> 19:59.531
- You're not having anyone killed.
- You're right, I know.

19:59.615 --> 20:02.909
But I do have a guy who could
seriously destroy his credit.

20:02.994 --> 20:05.787
Oh, well, then, thanks for trying.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.296
- Okay, now duck. You have to duck.
- Duck?

20:14.380 --> 20:16.339
Yeah, you gotta learn how to defend yourself.

20:16.424 --> 20:18.216
Vince, can I talk to you for a second?

20:18.301 --> 20:20.010
This is important, come on.

20:20.094 --> 20:21.970
Okay, just keep practicing that

20:22.054 --> 20:24.556
and you'll be a champ before you know it.

20:24.640 --> 20:27.100
Duck.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.810
- Duck.
- Rematch?

20:29.854 --> 20:31.771
All right, look, I spoke to Wick.

20:31.856 --> 20:34.649
Walsh says no go. I'm sorry.

20:35.526 --> 20:36.610
What are you sorry for?

20:36.694 --> 20:39.738
'Cause I fucked up.
If you don't get this movie it's my fault.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.073
You don't really believe that, do you?

20:42.158 --> 20:44.910
Ari got you the meeting.
I told him to postpone it.

20:44.994 --> 20:47.704
Ah, E...

20:47.788 --> 20:50.248
I mean,

20:50.333 --> 20:52.918
the truth is, I fucked up.

20:53.002 --> 20:55.003
I shouldn't have bought the house
before I had the money.

20:55.087 --> 20:58.924
Ari fucked up because he shouldn't have
told me we had a deal when we didn't.

20:59.008 --> 21:01.384
I mean, you thought
the script was great, and it is.

21:01.469 --> 21:03.428
James Cameron's doing it.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.263
Yeah, you're right.

21:05.348 --> 21:08.224
I didn't fuck up at all.
What are you giving me such a hard time for?

21:08.309 --> 21:09.643
It's my job.

21:09.727 --> 21:11.937
Look, if James Cameron
wants me for the movie,

21:12.021 --> 21:15.315
he'll set the meeting.
Or he'll see something I've done.

21:15.399 --> 21:17.901
There's nothing we can do.
It's out of our hands.

21:17.985 --> 21:21.237
- Lf he sees Queens Boulevard, though...
- We're gonna make $500,000.

21:21.322 --> 21:24.908
Half a mil for the day's work tomorrow.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.826
I'm not getting myself down.

21:27.370 --> 21:29.621
You know, my father didn't make that
in his whole life.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.123
No, mine either. He owed it, though.

21:32.208 --> 21:35.502
Yeah, so forget about Aquaman.

21:35.586 --> 21:39.506
If it's meant to be,
then it's meant to be, otherwise fuck it.

21:39.590 --> 21:42.634
Hey, besides, worse comes to worst,
we always have Turtle.

21:42.718 --> 21:45.053
Yeah, we always have Turtle.

21:45.137 --> 21:46.680
- Come on.
- All right, I'll call Emily.

21:46.764 --> 21:49.265
- I'll meet you in there.
- All right, man.

21:50.768 --> 21:54.854
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to the Hollywood Circuit

21:54.939 --> 21:59.693
and the Xbox and EA's
Fight Night championship.

21:59.777 --> 22:01.653
And now,

22:01.737 --> 22:04.906
let's get ready to rumble.

22:09.078 --> 22:12.205
In the red corner, from Queens, New York,

22:12.289 --> 22:13.957
height unknown,

22:14.041 --> 22:16.251
weight unknown,

22:16.335 --> 22:18.878
fighting as Rocky Marciano,

22:18.963 --> 22:24.134
introducing Turtle!

22:25.261 --> 22:27.554
Turtle! Yeah!

22:27.638 --> 22:30.807
Turtle! Turtle! Turtle!

22:30.891 --> 22:33.810
In the blue corner, from the Sunshine State,

22:33.894 --> 22:38.273
two-time Xbox
Southeast Conference Champion,

22:38.357 --> 22:42.527
Herby Green!

22:45.072 --> 22:46.322
You're a bum!

22:48.075 --> 22:51.202
We go to first-round action.

22:51.287 --> 22:52.954
Come on, Turtle!

22:55.332 --> 22:57.208
One and two, kid! Can't take it like a man!

22:59.628 --> 23:01.004
- Oh!
- He's getting killed.

23:05.634 --> 23:08.053
Yeah! Yeah!

23:08.137 --> 23:11.222
It's all over in the very first round!

23:11.307 --> 23:13.224
The winner by a knockout,

23:13.309 --> 23:16.936
Herby Green!

23:26.989 --> 23:29.074
You guys think I smoke too much pot?

23:29.158 --> 23:31.743
Turtle, relax.
You lost a video game tournament.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.162
Yeah, Turtle, in our eyes,
you're still the champ.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.581
The kid obviously had
some kind of a cheat code, bro.

23:36.665 --> 23:40.168
I heard he was a beta tester for that game.
Knew every in and out.

23:42.046 --> 23:44.339
- I'm working.
- I'm working.

23:44.423 --> 23:47.092
- Drama, smoke?
- What, am I not working?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.345
We're ready for you guys.

23:53.516 --> 23:56.226
Go get 'em.
- All right.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.403
Guess who Cameron wants
to play Aquaman's mother?

24:07.488 --> 24:08.780
I don't know, Ari. Cloris Leachman?

24:08.864 --> 24:10.365
Uh-uh. Sharon Stone.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.575
Guess who represents Sharon Stone?

24:12.660 --> 24:14.160
- You do.
- Uh-huh.

24:14.245 --> 24:17.038
Take a guess who Sharon Stone
is absolutely in love with.

24:17.123 --> 24:19.249
It ain't you, you little bitch.

24:19.333 --> 24:21.126
- It's you.
- Really, like love love?

24:21.210 --> 24:23.461
Well, she told Cameron last night at dinner

24:23.546 --> 24:26.464
her favorite actor in this town is you.

24:26.549 --> 24:28.716
- Sharon Stone said that?
- Absolutely.

24:28.801 --> 24:31.261
- She's still good looking.
- Yeah, in the right light.

24:31.345 --> 24:33.680
- So what do we do now?
- We bundle up and hit the slopes

24:33.764 --> 24:35.306
'cause James Cameron
is coming to Sundance.

24:35.391 --> 24:36.766
What, just to see me?

24:36.851 --> 24:40.145
And to see the prick director that won't
show him a print of the goddamn movie.

24:40.229 --> 24:41.896
- It better kill.
- Chung's ready for you.

24:41.981 --> 24:43.648
He says we're losing light.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.359
Okay. Good stuff, Ari.

24:46.443 --> 24:48.653
- Good stuff, Ari.
- ARl: You see that?

24:48.737 --> 24:50.405
Go get 'em, baby.

25:00.082 --> 25:02.417
I've been looking for you.

25:04.753 --> 25:06.796
I haven't been hiding.

25:09.425 --> 25:11.467
It's too bad you came alone.

25:14.221 --> 25:17.265
I am not alone.

25:40.414 --> 25:42.165
Hey, bro!

25:43.167 --> 25:46.044
Drink this!

25:57.640 --> 25:59.515
Like I said,

25:59.600 --> 26:01.476
too bad you came alone.

26:37.554 --> 26:41.057
The Energy Drink. Good till your heart pops!
