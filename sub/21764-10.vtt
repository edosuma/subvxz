Calm down, everyone.

01:05.690 --> 01:08.985
I'm sure this is perfectly normal.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.737
This is normal, right, Mo

01:10.820 --> 01:12.697
Like, the world's not ending, is it?

01:15.158 --> 01:16.785
-Aah!

01:19.079 --> 01:21.956
<i>Good evening, Madagascar.</i>

01:22.040 --> 01:24.709
<i>-Yes, it is I,</i>

01:24.793 --> 01:26.961
<i>the great and powerful Karl...</i>

01:27.045 --> 01:29.422
-<i>...here to announce my biggest,</i>

01:29.506 --> 01:32.717
<i>most exuberant plan of all time:</i>

01:32.801 --> 01:34.761
<i>I'm retiring!</i>

01:34.844 --> 01:36.095
What? Oh!

01:36.179 --> 01:38.932
<i>Chauncey and I are moving</i>

01:39.015 --> 01:41.643
<i>-to Florida!</i>

01:41.726 --> 01:44.521
<i>We hear it's quite nice all year-round.</i>

01:44.604 --> 01:47.524
Uh, sweet. Nice knowing you, pal.

01:47.607 --> 01:51.319
<i>Oh, but that's why I'm here, Julien.</i>

01:51.402 --> 01:55.073
<i>I am searching for my replacement!</i>

01:55.156 --> 01:56.616
The basement

01:56.699 --> 01:58.701
<i>Listen up: there are five golden mangoes</i>

01:58.785 --> 02:00.411
<i>hidden in the jungle,</i>
<i>and the five citizens</i>

02:00.495 --> 02:03.456
<i>who claim them will win</i>
<i>a private tour of my lair,</i>

02:03.540 --> 02:06.167
<i>-with a guest of their choice...</i>
-Oh!

02:06.251 --> 02:09.379
<i>...and a chance to compete and become</i>

02:09.462 --> 02:12.841
<i>King Julien's next evil nemesis.</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:15.593
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

02:15.677 --> 02:18.471
<i>I bring you Karl-Con!</i>

02:18.555 --> 02:21.558
<i>-Let the games begin.</i>

02:27.021 --> 02:30.817
Get me that golden mango, Dad!

02:40.910 --> 02:42.203
Todd!

02:45.039 --> 02:46.207
Aah!

02:56.217 --> 02:58.011
-Hoo-ah!

02:58.094 --> 03:00.763
Hmm, if I'm my own nemesis,

03:00.847 --> 03:03.182
then can't nobody take me down.

03:03.266 --> 03:04.893
I'm invincible, baby.

03:04.976 --> 03:08.313
I hate to say it, but that's
actually not a bad idea.

03:08.396 --> 03:09.981
No enemies, no threat. Wow.

03:10.064 --> 03:13.568
Can't believe this, but I think
all three of us are on the same page.

03:13.651 --> 03:15.612
-On it! Rah!

03:15.695 --> 03:18.531
Stupid golden mango.

03:18.615 --> 03:21.367
Why would I ever win anything to--ow!

03:23.995 --> 03:25.914
Huh?

03:29.250 --> 03:30.126
Huh? Ah!

03:30.960 --> 03:33.296
Huh? I got the last one!

03:33.379 --> 03:35.131
-Ha!

03:35.215 --> 03:36.341
-Yah!

03:36.424 --> 03:38.092
What the heck, man
Aah!

03:39.928 --> 03:43.556
Clover!

03:43.640 --> 03:46.059
Booyakit! Evil nemesis right here!

03:46.142 --> 03:47.477
Your Majesty, if I may.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.312
You're going to need a fierce competitor in there with you--as your partner.

03:51.231 --> 03:52.815
Hmm...

03:52.899 --> 03:56.194
Someone who can, uh, you know,
keep her king safe.

03:56.277 --> 03:57.695
-Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

03:57.779 --> 03:59.364
Oh, for--me!

03:59.447 --> 04:02.242
You should bring me, Your Majesty.

04:02.325 --> 04:03.576
Duh! You know what?

04:03.660 --> 04:06.496
Just say what you mean next time, Clover.

04:06.579 --> 04:08.915
It would save us all a lot of time.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.293
And while I'm off becoming my own villain,

04:12.377 --> 04:15.296
Mo-Mo, I've got a job for you.

04:16.506 --> 04:19.217
All right, everyone,
don't forget to cheer

04:19.300 --> 04:22.804
for your favorite players
with the provided poster boards.

04:22.887 --> 04:25.265
<i>Well, Ted, Karl's looking</i>
<i>for his replacement,</i>

04:25.348 --> 04:28.518
<i>and also, I'm thrilled</i>
<i>with how things are going in my life.</i>

04:28.601 --> 04:30.770
<i>We're doing good.</i>

04:33.481 --> 04:36.109
<i>Uh, how's it looking down there, Maurice?</i>

04:36.192 --> 04:39.237
Who's everybody rooting for?

04:39.320 --> 04:41.614
Make some noise, people!
And use the posters!

04:41.698 --> 04:44.492
King Julien!

04:50.248 --> 04:52.417
Go away! I'm not decent!

04:52.500 --> 04:55.128
-I said go a--

04:55.211 --> 04:57.088
Who are you?

04:57.171 --> 04:59.882
The name's Grandpa, Grandpa Mort.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.261
That's me there with you... baby Mort.

05:06.556 --> 05:07.724
-Hmm! Hmm.

05:09.058 --> 05:11.019
-Oh...
-Oh.

05:11.102 --> 05:13.604
Uh...hmm?

05:16.316 --> 05:18.735
Sorry, old guy. I don't see it.

05:18.818 --> 05:22.238
Think, Mort. Think very hard.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.199
Just like that bum to miss presents.

05:25.283 --> 05:27.410
-Happy Hanukkah, kids.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.081
Ah...

05:32.165 --> 05:35.001
Oh, Pop-Pop! I missed you!

05:35.084 --> 05:38.671
I know I missed a few Hanukkahs,

05:38.755 --> 05:40.256
so I brought you a little something.

05:40.339 --> 05:43.926
Oh, I hope it's a pencil!

05:44.010 --> 05:47.555
But

05:47.638 --> 05:49.682
Anything is possible if you don't mind

05:49.766 --> 05:52.477
breaking a few rules... and parole.

05:52.560 --> 05:56.314
Pack your bags, kid.
We are going to Karl-Con.

06:04.572 --> 06:07.658
Everyone, stay alert.
This could all be a ruse.

06:13.164 --> 06:14.707
Uh...

06:22.548 --> 06:25.051
Am I right, guys

06:29.639 --> 06:33.101
So glad you all could make it.

06:35.728 --> 06:40.108
Are we ready? Yes. In we go.

06:46.614 --> 06:48.449
Welcome to my laboratory.

06:48.533 --> 06:53.329
The first and only rule
at this stage of Karl-Con

06:53.412 --> 06:55.748
is no touching.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.418
Look around you: my fabulous
team of cockroach henchmen

06:59.502 --> 07:01.504
spent countless hours helping me construct

07:01.587 --> 07:04.340
some of the world's most deadly weaponry.

07:04.423 --> 07:08.261
-Aah!
Young buck in the back?

07:08.344 --> 07:10.805
Thanks for having me. Big fan.

07:10.888 --> 07:15.059
Question: once given the title
of King Julien's evil nemesis,

07:15.143 --> 07:17.395
does one have a license to kill?

07:17.478 --> 07:20.773
Great question.
The answer, of course, is

07:24.235 --> 07:25.445
No!

07:25.528 --> 07:27.238
Uh, my bad, y'all.

07:27.321 --> 07:29.991
I was told there'd be a snack situation.

07:30.074 --> 07:33.911
What have you done, you bloated pork rind?

07:33.995 --> 07:36.205
Oh, he didn't mean any harm, Karl.

07:36.289 --> 07:39.333
Butterfish is a big boy, ain't you, baby?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.502
Belly full of grits and love.

07:43.254 --> 07:44.589
Aah...

07:44.672 --> 07:46.424
No!

07:46.507 --> 07:49.385
I'm being sucked up, y'all.

07:49.469 --> 07:50.636
Aah!

07:50.720 --> 07:54.015
Aah!
Whoa! Butterfish!

07:54.098 --> 07:57.560
I did say no touching, didn't I?

07:59.729 --> 08:02.190
Ah, I can't wait to be my own nemesis

08:02.273 --> 08:03.983
so I can eat like this all the time.

08:04.066 --> 08:07.528
Hold it! In order to be
a true evil villain,

08:07.612 --> 08:11.032
you must learn to savor the moment!

08:11.115 --> 08:13.451
Come on, man! We're all starving!

08:13.534 --> 08:15.786
Savor it, Pancho!

08:15.870 --> 08:17.788
Now a little test.

08:17.872 --> 08:20.333
The first contestant
to buckle down and eat...

08:20.416 --> 08:22.335
-Mmm.
-...loses.

08:22.418 --> 08:25.505
-Ah!

08:25.588 --> 08:27.924
You'll just have to wait and see.

08:28.007 --> 08:31.636
Savor it.

08:31.719 --> 08:32.887
All right, kids.

08:32.970 --> 08:34.722
This is a pretty simple test.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.433
We all pick up our food
and eat it at the same time.

08:37.517 --> 08:40.102
-That way, nobody--
No, Amy!

08:40.186 --> 08:42.355
-The bad man said to wait!

08:42.438 --> 08:45.691
Leave me alone, Dad. I'm starving.

08:45.775 --> 08:48.152
What are you all looking at?

08:48.236 --> 08:50.947
-Stop judging me!

08:52.240 --> 08:54.909
Oh, Daddy, what's happening?

08:54.992 --> 08:57.286
I don't know, dearest.

08:59.622 --> 09:02.041
-No!
-Dad!

09:02.124 --> 09:06.128
Don't just sit there
on your stupid butt, Dad!

09:06.212 --> 09:10.299
Ooh, you're the worst #Dad ever!

09:10.383 --> 09:13.719
-Ah! Dad!

09:13.803 --> 09:17.056
Mort, you're gonna make
a great evil villain,

09:17.139 --> 09:19.308
unlike your old fart of a grandpa,

09:19.392 --> 09:21.269
who spent his whole dang life in prison.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.145
Uh, I'm not sure, Pop-Pop.

09:23.229 --> 09:25.106
Aren't evil villains mean?

09:25.189 --> 09:27.942
I'm only mean when the voices
in my head accuse me

09:28.025 --> 09:30.194
of crimes I don't remember committing.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.197
-Oh, boy.
-Yeah.

09:33.281 --> 09:35.032
It's inside you, Mort,

09:35.116 --> 09:36.742
just like it's inside me.

09:36.826 --> 09:39.745
Now, think about it:
if you win, you'll be able to have

09:39.829 --> 09:42.373
more one-on-one time with the royal feet

09:42.456 --> 09:44.041
than you could ever imagine!

09:44.125 --> 09:47.753
Yeah, DJ Glitterbunz turning it down

09:47.837 --> 09:51.757
a notch with a smooth summer jam.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.051
You're right, Grandpa.

09:54.135 --> 09:56.554
This is totally worth it. Night-night.

09:56.637 --> 10:00.600
Nighty-night, my sweet little grandchild.

10:03.185 --> 10:04.979
I should have known Karl
was up to something.

10:05.062 --> 10:07.148
Four contestants gone already.

10:07.231 --> 10:09.150
He's picking us off one by one.

10:09.233 --> 10:12.445
Clover, I need you to relax.

10:12.528 --> 10:15.406
I say that because
you're freaking me out, man!

10:15.489 --> 10:18.034
-We escape, Your Majesty,

10:18.117 --> 10:20.620
before we are cockroach kibble.

10:22.788 --> 10:25.291
Hurry up, Fairfax.
I can feel it tingling in my bones.

10:25.374 --> 10:27.460
-We're next.
-You don't gotta tell me twice.

10:29.003 --> 10:29.837
Uh...

10:29.920 --> 10:31.797
Freeze! Hold it right there!

10:32.715 --> 10:34.925
-See you, pal!
-Oh, that's just great.

10:37.011 --> 10:38.888
Oh, no! Mother!

10:41.223 --> 10:44.393
Ooh.  That can't smell good.

10:44.477 --> 10:45.645
Aah... aah...

10:45.728 --> 10:48.147
Oh, that smarts!

10:48.230 --> 10:51.525
So we're gonna escape
a different way, right?

10:51.609 --> 10:52.860
Right, Clover?

10:56.364 --> 10:59.200
Oh, would you look at that?

10:59.283 --> 11:00.868
It's morning already.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.338
-Aah.

11:12.421 --> 11:13.506
Uh...

11:13.589 --> 11:15.299
<i>Good morning, friends.</i>

11:15.383 --> 11:16.717
<i>Congratulations</i>

11:16.801 --> 11:20.388
on becoming Karl-Con's
final four contestants.

11:20.471 --> 11:22.264
Just a quick FYI.

11:22.348 --> 11:24.892
<i>The only way to win Karl-Con</i>

11:24.975 --> 11:28.604
<i>is to survive the Karl-Brynth.</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:32.566
"Karl

11:32.650 --> 11:35.236
Look at this place.
It's actually kind of nice.

11:35.319 --> 11:38.572
Yeah, I don't know. Something seems off.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.868
-There it is.

11:45.579 --> 11:47.289
Aah!

11:52.336 --> 11:54.713
Here we go, kid. Time to shine.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.632
Now, you get this gig, you'll get all

11:56.715 --> 11:58.467
the Hanukkah pencils you ever dreamed of!

11:58.551 --> 12:02.263
Yay! I hope I get some of those
erasers you used to give us

12:02.346 --> 12:05.099
that make the paper all pink and smudgy.

12:05.182 --> 12:06.851
I don't know any other kind.

12:15.943 --> 12:17.611
Time for round two.

12:17.695 --> 12:19.113
<i>Aah!</i>

12:21.699 --> 12:24.410
-Oh, gosh.

12:34.712 --> 12:37.047
Oh, Chauncey.

12:37.131 --> 12:40.843
We've got Julien right where we want him.

12:40.926 --> 12:45.306
All I have to do is get rid
of that stumpy little mouse lemur

12:45.389 --> 12:46.599
and his Pop-Pop.

12:46.682 --> 12:50.686
It's perfect.

12:50.769 --> 12:53.981
Um, is the field trip almost over yet?

12:54.064 --> 12:56.567
This is all Karl's world. It's fake.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.652
Which means the ocean's fake.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.155
We just need to find a way out.

13:01.238 --> 13:03.282
We could just drink it.

13:03.365 --> 13:05.743
Dr. S says extra sodium might help

13:05.826 --> 13:07.995
my near-fatal levels of water retention.

13:08.078 --> 13:10.080
-That's it, kid!

13:10.164 --> 13:12.249
-Start drinking.
-Okay.

13:13.876 --> 13:15.628
Yes, keep drinking. It's working.

13:19.465 --> 13:20.508
Ah...

-There has got to be a way out.

Karl built everything in here in his lab.
It's all mechanical.

13:51.497 --> 13:52.915
-It's death, Clover.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.544
Just accept it. Karl was always gonna win.

No, we just have to find a way to...
