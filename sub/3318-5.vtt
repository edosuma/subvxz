I couldn't
identify it.
I think I can.

09:44.350 --> 09:45.717
Olivia...

09:45.719 --> 09:47.852
You're wondering
why I'm here.

09:47.854 --> 09:49.588
When you left
to marry another,

09:49.590 --> 09:51.856
You gave me
the distinct impression

09:51.858 --> 09:53.024
That you would
not return.

09:53.026 --> 09:55.093
I know.

09:56.862 --> 09:58.930
But things have
changed since then.

10:00.733 --> 10:03.635
It was discovered...

10:03.637 --> 10:04.869
That you and I
were intimate.

10:04.871 --> 10:06.871
How?

10:06.873 --> 10:08.106
I don't know.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.276
Perhaps a servant
whispered to another.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.378
But the source
hardly matters.

10:13.380 --> 10:15.280
Once it got
in the air,

10:15.282 --> 10:16.915
I was ruined.

10:16.917 --> 10:19.384
I'm so ashamed

10:19.386 --> 10:21.653
To come here
this way...

10:23.756 --> 10:25.690
...But I had
nowhere else to go.

10:28.027 --> 10:30.662
Please don't blame bash
for telling me about olivia.

10:30.664 --> 10:32.731
I pressed him
unmercifully.

10:33.799 --> 10:36.768
So, why did she leave?

10:36.770 --> 10:39.771
An offer of marriage.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.172
Not to mention the fact

10:41.174 --> 10:42.340
That my mother made her life

10:42.342 --> 10:43.942
Absolutely miserable.

10:43.944 --> 10:46.311
Honing her skills
on your first love.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.213
What didn't she like about her?

10:48.215 --> 10:50.048
There was an incident.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.217
In the boathouse.

10:52.219 --> 10:55.086
An incident where we were...

10:55.088 --> 10:58.156
Found in the boathouse.

10:58.158 --> 11:01.059
I see.

11:01.061 --> 11:04.329
And, um, olivia is married now?

11:04.331 --> 11:05.397
No.

11:05.399 --> 11:06.998
No, the offer fell through

11:07.000 --> 11:09.367
Once people learned of our...

11:09.369 --> 11:11.269
Relationship.

11:11.271 --> 11:12.404
Oh.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.172
Mary, I'm-I'm sorry

11:14.174 --> 11:17.175
That my-my past has come back.

11:17.177 --> 11:20.311
But know that it is in the past.

11:20.313 --> 11:23.448
What I feel for olivia now is
a sense of responsibility.

11:23.450 --> 11:25.016
She would've known
what she was entering into.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.017
We've been engaged

11:26.019 --> 11:27.419
Since you were a child.

11:27.421 --> 11:29.888
Obviously you couldn't
offer marriage.

11:29.890 --> 11:32.223
Which is...

11:32.225 --> 11:34.059
N-not to say
that I don't understand

11:34.061 --> 11:35.160
Why you want to help her.

11:35.162 --> 11:37.028
Of-of course, I do.

11:37.030 --> 11:38.396
Thank you.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.732
It might take some time,
but with my support,

11:40.734 --> 11:42.233
Olivia will regain
her credibility.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.002
And find a match.

11:44.004 --> 11:46.905
One that ensures her
happiness and her well-being.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.307
So we can all move on.

11:50.409 --> 11:52.310
It's a talent really.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.913
No matter what the topic,
he can wind it back to pepper.

11:54.915 --> 11:56.014
(laughs)

11:56.016 --> 11:58.883
Sorry, sorry, go on.

11:58.885 --> 12:01.019
Et vacet annalis.

12:01.021 --> 12:02.954
I bring up politics.

12:02.956 --> 12:04.389
"pepper transactions are
a political minefield."

12:04.391 --> 12:06.257
(both laugh)
history?

12:06.259 --> 12:08.193
"the peppercorn has
a storied past."

12:08.195 --> 12:10.862
I doubt he'd wind
virgil back to pepper.

12:10.864 --> 12:12.864
Oh, stop.
We know what happens.

12:12.866 --> 12:15.800
He wanders around troy
for another 100 stanzas.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.137
Shh, it's olivia.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.905
She looks mortified.

12:29.982 --> 12:32.851
You and I find ourselves
strangely aligned for once.

12:32.853 --> 12:35.019
Are people leaving?

12:35.021 --> 12:37.822
She dislikes olivia
more than you?

12:37.824 --> 12:38.890
Apparently.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.759
Why would olivia return here?

12:40.761 --> 12:42.894
Kenna: With the prince's
favor, she can find a match.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.763
If need be,
francis could force the issue.

12:44.765 --> 12:46.030
Who would willingly take
used property?

12:46.032 --> 12:47.532
Even a royal's.

12:47.534 --> 12:49.300
Well, it sounds like
there were real feelings there.

12:49.302 --> 12:51.136
Should she be punished forever?

12:51.138 --> 12:52.170
Her station's fallen.

12:52.172 --> 12:53.772
She doesn't belong at court.

12:53.774 --> 12:54.906
Well, some might say
the same of you.

12:54.908 --> 12:55.974
Because I don't have a title.

12:55.976 --> 12:57.442
How dare you.

12:57.444 --> 12:58.910
Mary:
Stop, please.

12:58.912 --> 12:59.911
There's enough ill will

12:59.913 --> 13:01.446
At court today.

13:03.949 --> 13:06.251
(women murmuring)

13:06.253 --> 13:09.053
Hello, olivia.

13:09.055 --> 13:10.121
I'm mary.

13:10.123 --> 13:11.823
I'm honored.

13:11.825 --> 13:13.191
Oh, it's all right.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.360
Come, sit with me
and my friends.

13:15.362 --> 13:17.362
I'm afraid there's not
going to be much virgil.

13:17.364 --> 13:19.998
Everybody's too excited
about the harvest festival.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.200
And the beginning
of the blood month.

13:22.202 --> 13:23.802
They've been slaughtering
in the kitchens all week.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.504
Out with the old,
in with the new.

13:26.506 --> 13:29.207
I heard that your things
were still missing.

13:29.209 --> 13:33.211
Perhaps I could lend you a dress
for the festival if you'd like.

13:33.213 --> 13:35.146
Thank you.

13:35.148 --> 13:37.549
I appreciate it.

13:40.152 --> 13:42.287
Well, hello there!

13:42.289 --> 13:44.289
What exactly did you tell
mary about olivia?

13:44.291 --> 13:47.358
Just that she was your first.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.127
I never said of how many.

13:49.129 --> 13:50.361
Don't be an ass.

13:50.363 --> 13:53.498
And keep your opinions
to yourself.

13:53.500 --> 13:55.500
Well, forgive me
if I overstepped.

13:55.502 --> 13:56.968
Is that all?

13:56.970 --> 13:58.837
No. No, I have
reason to believe

13:58.839 --> 13:59.871
That olivia's carriage

13:59.873 --> 14:01.573
Was attacked by pagans.

14:01.575 --> 14:02.941
I recognized the
words she heard

14:02.943 --> 14:04.409
From when you said them.

14:04.411 --> 14:05.410
Well, what were they even doing

14:05.412 --> 14:06.611
Driving through the blood wood?

14:06.613 --> 14:08.313
Olivia's driver was told

14:08.315 --> 14:09.480
That the kingsroad was flooded.

14:09.482 --> 14:11.015
Which it isn't.

14:12.518 --> 14:14.152
Bash, they're luring people in.

14:25.030 --> 14:26.231
Oh, no.

14:31.570 --> 14:33.571
This is mary's ring.

14:33.573 --> 14:34.639
It has her crest on it.

14:34.641 --> 14:36.274
Why do you have it?

14:36.276 --> 14:39.043
I was taking it to her.
Yet her room is that way.

14:39.045 --> 14:40.311
Then I remembered
she lent it to me.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.479
So I was taking it back.

14:41.481 --> 14:43.982
Where?
You're confusing me.

14:43.984 --> 14:45.650
Let's return it together.
No.

14:45.652 --> 14:48.219
Wait.

14:48.221 --> 14:49.487
I took it.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.055
Why?

14:51.057 --> 14:53.024
I don't know.

14:53.026 --> 14:54.993
I take things sometimes.

14:56.428 --> 14:57.662
It makes me feel better.

14:57.664 --> 15:00.064
(chuckles)

15:00.066 --> 15:01.666
Well, you're a troubled,
jealous little girl.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.668
Aren't you?
Please, your majesty.

15:03.670 --> 15:06.304
If mary knew,
I'd be sent home disgraced.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.039
Perhaps with one hand.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.208
Though your softhearted friend

15:10.210 --> 15:12.076
Would probably spare you that.

15:14.046 --> 15:16.114
I'll think on this.

15:26.191 --> 15:27.325
Looks like a trap.

15:27.327 --> 15:29.060
What the hell?

15:29.062 --> 15:30.428
Your first is it?

15:30.430 --> 15:34.399
It's the heretics
making sacrifice.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.173
(horse neighing)

15:54.453 --> 15:55.954
He's still breathing.

15:55.956 --> 15:57.055
We should get out of here.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.089
They're still bleeding them out.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.624
Surely the devils are nearby.

15:59.626 --> 16:00.625
He's breathing.

16:00.627 --> 16:02.093
Now get over here and catch him.

16:02.095 --> 16:04.128
You're interrupting the ritual.

16:04.130 --> 16:05.430
He's all but dead,
don't do this.

16:05.432 --> 16:07.131
They might see you
and come after you.

16:11.070 --> 16:13.438
Let them.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.545
Blues, I think.

16:20.547 --> 16:22.580
To compliment your complexion.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.682
I'm sorry, your warmth.

16:24.684 --> 16:28.119
It's... Unexpected.

16:28.121 --> 16:29.721
I always knew
francis had a past.

16:29.723 --> 16:31.222
Men are allowed to have them,

16:31.224 --> 16:34.192
Whereas we have
our reputations ruined.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.728
Hardly seems fair.

16:36.730 --> 16:38.396
I don't need your pity.

16:38.398 --> 16:40.465
Stop.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.334
I can see it all over your face.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.770
You look at me
and you see

16:45.772 --> 16:47.405
A girl who threw away
her virginity

16:47.407 --> 16:50.375
On a man she knew
she could never have.

16:50.377 --> 16:52.610
Well, you're wrong.

16:52.612 --> 16:55.446
I thought I could have him.

16:55.448 --> 16:58.116
Because francis spoke
of marrying me.

16:58.118 --> 17:00.251
That's not possible.

17:00.253 --> 17:02.653
Is your wedding assured?

17:02.655 --> 17:04.088
Was it always?

17:04.090 --> 17:05.289
It might not be assured.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.791
But it is desired.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.092
By both of us.

17:08.094 --> 17:10.094
Though arguably,

17:10.096 --> 17:11.562
You know much less
about francis's desires

17:11.564 --> 17:13.164
Than I do.

17:14.266 --> 17:17.268
What we had was true.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.037
Passion.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.538
Love.

17:20.540 --> 17:23.374
Intimacy.

17:23.376 --> 17:25.243
It was not manufactured

17:25.245 --> 17:27.045
Out of a perceived
political need.

17:27.047 --> 17:29.180
You've been gone
a very long time.

17:29.182 --> 17:31.182
Things have changed.

17:31.184 --> 17:33.651
Perhaps.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.320
Or perhaps now that I'm here,

17:36.322 --> 17:40.058
Offering myself as an option,

17:40.060 --> 17:42.060
He'll choose to be with me.

17:42.062 --> 17:44.495
Once again.

17:53.806 --> 17:56.074
Could you hear them?
Were they close?

17:56.076 --> 17:57.475
I had no sense of them.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.210
Some would say you had no sense.

17:59.212 --> 18:02.380
That you defiled their faith.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.482
A faith riddled
with human sacrifice.

18:04.484 --> 18:05.783
When did that start?

18:05.785 --> 18:08.753
They've made blood sacrifices
for centuries.

18:08.755 --> 18:10.354
Animal sacrifices.

18:10.356 --> 18:11.622
Not always.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.791
It was simply more hidden.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.626
Less bold.

18:15.628 --> 18:18.296
I thought these murders,
these bodies hanging,

18:18.298 --> 18:20.431
Their true purpose was
to scare people away.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.634
Civilized people from land
that they believe is theirs.

18:23.636 --> 18:25.636
Or claimed for hunting.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.372
And instead they're hunting
civilized people.

18:28.374 --> 18:31.175
Travelers. Luring them in.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.377
Why? What's changed?

18:33.379 --> 18:34.645
I don't know.

18:34.647 --> 18:37.248
But I do know this.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.250
You have interrupted
a sacrifice,

18:39.252 --> 18:40.852
Which they will not
take kindly to.

18:40.854 --> 18:44.388
Stay close to the castle
in the coming days.

18:44.390 --> 18:46.591
You could be in grave danger.

18:58.537 --> 18:59.737
Excuse me.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.139
I'm looking for
the wine cellar.

19:01.141 --> 19:02.140
Can you direct me?

19:02.142 --> 19:03.474
Sure can, ma'am.

19:03.476 --> 19:04.509
It's just through there.

19:04.511 --> 19:05.610
Ain't likely to miss it.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.312
Have we met?

19:09.781 --> 19:13.184
Don't think so.

19:13.186 --> 19:15.319
It's just... Your voice,
it sounds so familiar.

19:17.222 --> 19:19.223
Anyway.

19:19.225 --> 19:22.627
Thank you for your help.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.230
Hey.

19:26.232 --> 19:27.632
Who-who's the lady?

19:27.634 --> 19:30.601
Oh, that's a guest
of the court.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.304
It's the girl who escaped
from the road bandits.

19:33.306 --> 19:35.173
Didn't you hear?

19:35.175 --> 19:37.575
A carriage was overrun.

19:37.577 --> 19:39.277
I-I did hear.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.811
Just didn't know
anyone escaped.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.548
Hmm.

19:43.550 --> 19:45.316
We did discuss marriage once.

19:45.318 --> 19:47.652
A moment of weakness.

19:47.654 --> 19:49.820
Lovers, dreaming of
a future together.

19:49.822 --> 19:52.423
I was...

19:52.425 --> 19:53.925
Caught up.

19:53.927 --> 19:57.195
And not sure that the scottish
alliance was a good one.

19:57.197 --> 19:58.496
Caught up with a noble girl.

19:58.498 --> 20:01.799
And a very rich one.

20:01.801 --> 20:04.635
Not one with a country in need,

20:04.637 --> 20:05.770
Hanging around her neck.

20:05.772 --> 20:07.939
It's ironic,
isn't it?

20:07.941 --> 20:10.374
That the very alliance
that forged our engagement has

20:10.376 --> 20:12.276
Always complicated it terribly.

20:12.278 --> 20:15.913
It has. But that is beyond
our control.

20:15.915 --> 20:19.584
And the fact of the matter is,
I am committed to you now.

20:21.286 --> 20:24.555
I am glad to hear you say it.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.290
And towards that end,

20:26.292 --> 20:27.925
The viscountess demarchelier
has offered

20:27.927 --> 20:29.594
To house olivia in paris.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.829
She has a very
lavish estate.

20:31.831 --> 20:33.264
In paris?

20:33.266 --> 20:34.966
I thought it best
she go.

20:34.968 --> 20:37.401
Olivia still has feelings
for you.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.937
She only confided in me
to stake a claim.

20:39.939 --> 20:43.474
I-I know that you feel
responsible for her...

20:43.476 --> 20:46.911
But I wanted to help you
find a comfortable arrangement.

20:48.013 --> 20:49.647
I'll let olivia know.

20:51.984 --> 20:54.652
Mary strikes me
as a most dutiful daughter.

20:54.654 --> 20:56.754
She writes so often
to her mother, doesn't she?

20:56.756 --> 20:59.357
They've been separated
a long while.

20:59.359 --> 21:00.725
Well, yes, they have.

21:00.727 --> 21:03.027
Have you made
a decision about
my wrongdoing?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.495
Not yet, dear.

21:04.497 --> 21:07.398
I met marie de guise only once.

21:07.400 --> 21:10.534
After the engagement
to francis was negotiated,

21:10.536 --> 21:14.805
She delivered her six-year-old
daughter to me.

21:14.807 --> 21:19.343
Personally,
I found her quite cold.

21:20.712 --> 21:23.414
And poor mary,
she was so scared.

21:23.416 --> 21:25.549
I had to take her under my wing.

21:25.551 --> 21:27.451
We were quite close
when she was young,

21:27.453 --> 21:28.786
Did you know that?

21:28.788 --> 21:29.920
I didn't.

21:29.922 --> 21:31.656
You know, it's true.

21:31.658 --> 21:32.957
And then her life was
threatened,

21:32.959 --> 21:34.959
And I had to send her away
to the convent.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.061
And that was very difficult.

21:37.063 --> 21:39.430
I'd grown quite attached.

21:39.432 --> 21:42.933
You could say I associate her
with loss,

21:42.935 --> 21:44.568
And it pains me.

21:44.570 --> 21:47.538
That's why
I push her away.

21:47.540 --> 21:48.973
Upon reflection,
I have made

21:48.975 --> 21:50.975
A few missteps
since her return.

21:50.977 --> 21:52.977
I'm afraid she's not honest
with me

21:52.979 --> 21:55.446
When I ask her if she's happy
here in France.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.481
I assume she's more

21:57.483 --> 21:58.716
Honest with her mother.

21:58.718 --> 22:00.851
Here's an idea.

22:00.853 --> 22:03.054
Before mary's letters
to her mother are posted,

22:03.056 --> 22:04.889
Why don't you
bring them to me?

22:04.891 --> 22:08.392
And that way, I can improve
upon her stay at court.

22:08.394 --> 22:09.727
Your grace...

22:09.729 --> 22:11.462
Those are my terms.
Reject them,

22:11.464 --> 22:13.497
And you'll be sent home
disgraced, labeled a thief,

22:13.499 --> 22:16.934
And your future
destroyed.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.836
Well, do think it over.

22:18.838 --> 22:20.905
The decision's yours.

22:31.917 --> 22:35.886
Lady olivia d'amencourt requests
an audience, my lord.

22:38.790 --> 22:40.091
Olivia.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.561
I was coming
to find you, actually.

22:43.563 --> 22:45.629
I couldn't resist.
(giggles)

22:45.631 --> 22:48.666
We've been old enough
to drink for a while now.

22:48.668 --> 22:50.368
Yes, I know,
but smuggling it in

22:50.370 --> 22:51.769
Was always half the fun.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.671
Have a drink with me.

22:53.673 --> 22:55.740
All right. Just one.

22:55.742 --> 22:57.942
Ah, but that's what
you said last year.

22:57.944 --> 22:59.977
Do you remember?

22:59.979 --> 23:01.879
I remember nothing
of last year.

23:01.881 --> 23:03.748
You were spongy
with liquor.

23:03.750 --> 23:06.984
I had to keep you hidden
from your mother all day.

23:06.986 --> 23:08.953
God, how she hated me.

23:14.626 --> 23:17.795
I should tell you my news
while I have the chance.

23:17.797 --> 23:19.930
I've arranged for
a very well-regarded family

23:19.932 --> 23:22.933
In paris to host you
for as long as you need.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.535
What?

23:24.537 --> 23:28.639
Surely your problems
of reputation have not reached

23:28.641 --> 23:30.741
As far as paris.

23:30.743 --> 23:33.744
It's far away from here,
far from your home.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.546
The demarcheliers will make
valuable introductions

23:35.548 --> 23:36.947
To society,
and from there...

23:36.949 --> 23:38.749
But you said I could stay here.

23:38.751 --> 23:40.785
Why are you changing your mind?

23:40.787 --> 23:43.087
I think you know.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.956
This is best...

23:45.958 --> 23:47.892
For all parties involved.

23:53.432 --> 23:57.568
Unfortunately,
the stain removal
was unsuccessful...

23:57.570 --> 23:59.437
To my great
displeasure.

23:59.439 --> 24:01.105
Don't speak to me
of your pleasure.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.474
You managed to get me out
of my dress.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.776
True. That was a success.

24:05.778 --> 24:07.711
I'm laughable to you,
is that it?

24:07.713 --> 24:09.580
No, of course not.

24:09.582 --> 24:12.783
I must be, for you to behave
in this fashion.

24:12.785 --> 24:15.986
You don't understand
what's at stake.

24:15.988 --> 24:19.590
I have two younger sisters
who cannot marry until I do.

24:19.592 --> 24:21.725
My family has spent a fortune,

24:21.727 --> 24:23.994
All to see me land
the right man.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.997
It's all they care about,
it's all I've been raised to do.

24:26.999 --> 24:29.467
And if I'm linked to you,
that will never happen.

24:29.469 --> 24:31.035
Look, I <i>do</i> care

24:31.037 --> 24:33.003
Because I care
for you.

24:33.005 --> 24:34.738
It doesn't have
to stop your goals,

24:34.740 --> 24:36.674
Your marriage,
your mission here.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.944
And if people find out?

24:39.946 --> 24:42.480
There's a girl here whose
reputation was ruined

24:42.482 --> 24:44.014
Over the love for a royal.

24:44.016 --> 24:46.150
Imagine if that had been
a kitchen boy.

24:46.152 --> 24:47.751
I'm sorry, but the shame.

24:50.155 --> 24:52.523
I understand.

24:52.525 --> 24:56.093
I'll leave you be.

24:56.095 --> 25:00.831
I don't see why I can't just
stay here, for a time, anyway.

25:00.833 --> 25:05.803
Mary's under the impression
that you still care for me,

25:05.805 --> 25:09.006
Which makes her uncomfortable,
understandably.

25:10.575 --> 25:12.176
She's right.

25:13.845 --> 25:17.515
I made such a mistake leaving.

25:19.217 --> 25:21.085
Olivia...

25:21.087 --> 25:23.287
We both knew that you would.

25:24.256 --> 25:25.656
I've always been engaged.

25:25.658 --> 25:27.291
Engagements break.

25:27.293 --> 25:28.993
Alliances end.

25:28.995 --> 25:33.063
The only thing that's changed
are my feelings for mary.

25:33.065 --> 25:36.967
The man I knew put
his country first...

25:36.969 --> 25:40.938
Above all else.

25:40.940 --> 25:43.707
I so admired that about you.

25:43.709 --> 25:45.776
Your sense of duty.

25:45.778 --> 25:48.946
That's the man
I fell in love with.

25:48.948 --> 25:50.681
It's the man I love still.

25:50.683 --> 25:53.584
Olivia, you shouldn't say
these things.

25:53.586 --> 25:55.019
I have to.

25:55.021 --> 25:59.957
Francis, this year has
been torture.

25:59.959 --> 26:01.759
And not because of the scandal,

26:01.761 --> 26:04.194
But because I had
to endure it without you.

26:04.196 --> 26:07.097
Do you know
how many nights

26:07.099 --> 26:08.832
I would lay
in bed...

26:08.834 --> 26:12.636
And remember how you used
to touch me.

26:14.673 --> 26:17.007
I want to stay.

26:19.344 --> 26:21.812
If not as your wife...

26:21.814 --> 26:24.081
Then as your mistress.

26:24.083 --> 26:29.820
Because I would rather have
some small part of you,

26:29.822 --> 26:31.655
Than none of you at all.

26:39.364 --> 26:42.766
You want me...

26:42.768 --> 26:44.902
And I want you.

26:44.904 --> 26:47.605
And I'm telling you...

26:47.607 --> 26:50.608
You can have me...

26:50.610 --> 26:52.242
Any way you want.

27:04.656 --> 27:07.391
Mary, what happened?
Why is olivia staying?

27:07.393 --> 27:10.294
But her belongings
were recovered from the wood,

27:10.296 --> 27:11.895
And they're being unpacked
in the east wing.

27:11.897 --> 27:13.263
You must be mistaken.

27:13.265 --> 27:14.965
Maybe she's packing for paris.

27:14.967 --> 27:16.066
A servant told me.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.335
Well, the servant
must be wrong!

27:19.371 --> 27:20.904
Sorry.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.140
I'll inquire again.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.942
Discreetly.

27:30.048 --> 27:32.683
Looks like your lady has
a new necklace.

27:32.685 --> 27:34.418
So blatantly
disrespectful.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.153
I'm not sure what you mean.

27:37.956 --> 27:40.791
I mean that kenna wears
a necklace...

27:40.793 --> 27:43.861
Given to me
as a first anniversary gift

27:43.863 --> 27:45.429
From my husband the king;

27:45.431 --> 27:47.698
Her lover.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.066
You must be mistaken.

27:49.068 --> 27:51.869
I'm not.

27:51.871 --> 27:54.238
You didn't know?

27:56.441 --> 27:58.842
Well, it won't last.

27:58.844 --> 28:01.178
You learn the signs
after a while:

28:01.180 --> 28:04.348
Which girl is serious,
which is not.

28:04.350 --> 28:07.918
Sounds like a terrible
way to live.

28:07.920 --> 28:11.288
I've forgotten
the alternative.

28:11.290 --> 28:14.358
We were wed when
we were 14, you know?

28:14.360 --> 28:17.928
And we were happy,
for a time.

28:17.930 --> 28:19.229
I didn't realize.

28:19.231 --> 28:22.366
That we loved each other
or that love can turn?

28:22.368 --> 28:24.234
Especially the love
of a king

28:24.236 --> 28:28.072
Who's loved by so many.

28:28.074 --> 28:30.374
Kings are offered
every opportunity.

28:30.376 --> 28:33.210
No one dares see
his indiscretions.

28:33.212 --> 28:37.081
He'd known her first--

28:37.083 --> 28:41.085
Diane.

28:41.087 --> 28:43.721
I found out she was there...

28:43.723 --> 28:47.124
In his heart... All along.

28:47.126 --> 28:52.129
He's always very kind
and noble to them afterwards.

28:52.131 --> 28:53.864
He feels responsible
for them.

28:53.866 --> 28:57.367
It makes him feel
even better about himself.

28:57.369 --> 28:59.737
I don't know how
it feels for them.

28:59.739 --> 29:02.406
But we all go on.

29:10.415 --> 29:12.883
Greer:
And we're supposed to just sit
there, discussing virgil.

29:12.885 --> 29:14.184
Ugh! Virgil's a bore.

29:14.186 --> 29:16.353
What a relief
to hear someone else say it.

29:16.355 --> 29:18.021
Do you know which roman I like?

29:18.023 --> 29:19.790
Alaric the visigoth.

29:19.792 --> 29:21.358
Hmm.
Ever heard of him?
Mm-mm.

29:21.360 --> 29:25.496
He included 3,000 pounds
of pepper

29:25.498 --> 29:28.465
As part of the ransom
he demanded from rome
when he sacked the city.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.467
Instead of payment,
pepper!

29:30.469 --> 29:32.169
True story.

29:36.441 --> 29:37.808
(quietly):
My lord.

29:37.810 --> 29:40.978
May I have a word?

29:40.980 --> 29:42.513
Excuse me.

29:43.915 --> 29:46.350
The driver has died,
unfortunately.

29:46.352 --> 29:48.318
Yet, in light of our
previous conversation,

29:48.320 --> 29:50.087
I thought you might be
interested

29:50.089 --> 29:53.257
In what he talked about
before he passed over.

29:53.259 --> 29:57.928
He spoke of the pagans need
for the fresh blood sacrifice.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.930
Their god is more
like the devil.

29:59.932 --> 30:01.999
A devil on this earth.

30:02.001 --> 30:03.834
He heard them talk
of a creature.

30:03.836 --> 30:04.868
A creature?

30:04.870 --> 30:06.370
A bargain they've struck
with a being

30:06.372 --> 30:09.206
Who resides in the woods,
in the dark.

30:09.208 --> 30:12.342
In a cave somewhere
only a chosen few know of.

30:12.344 --> 30:16.079
They give it blood,
or it drains them of life.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.524
I spoke with the servant,

30:27.526 --> 30:29.493
And olivia is moving
into the east wing.

30:29.495 --> 30:31.094
So everyone lies to me.

30:31.096 --> 30:32.563
Francis, you.

30:32.565 --> 30:33.997
What?

30:33.999 --> 30:35.499
Mary, have you
not eaten?

30:35.501 --> 30:36.967
You seem a little unsteady.

30:36.969 --> 30:38.836
Where did you get the necklace?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.239
Is it true?

30:42.241 --> 30:44.274
Are you having an affair
with the king?

30:44.276 --> 30:46.577
It's not an affair; it's more.

30:46.579 --> 30:49.847
He's in paris
breaking off with diane.

30:49.849 --> 30:51.181
And what of his wife?

30:51.183 --> 30:53.116
Their marriage is nothing more

30:53.118 --> 30:54.918
Than a political alliance--
she doesn't care.

30:54.920 --> 30:56.854
So says the man
who's trying to bed you.

30:56.856 --> 30:58.288
Since when do you care
about the queen?

30:58.290 --> 30:59.523
I don't.

30:59.525 --> 31:01.258
I care about you.

31:01.260 --> 31:02.993
I know you feel protected,

31:02.995 --> 31:05.095
But you don't want
catherine de medici

31:05.097 --> 31:06.396
As an enemy.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.898
End it now, kenna.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.267
Is that a command...
Given by my queen?

31:10.269 --> 31:12.369
No. Given by a friend.

31:13.872 --> 31:16.006
But given nonetheless.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.275
Whatever you think this is,
that it's love...

31:18.277 --> 31:19.643
What I think
is that he's asked me

31:19.645 --> 31:21.111
To be his official mistress.

31:23.314 --> 31:26.450
Which means I follow
your commands no longer.

31:26.452 --> 31:28.418
I answer to the king.

31:32.891 --> 31:34.958
Mary, there you are.

31:36.127 --> 31:37.628
Have you moved olivia
into the castle?

31:37.630 --> 31:39.096
Tell me it isn't true.

31:39.098 --> 31:40.430
I was coming
to tell you.

31:40.432 --> 31:41.932
I've had word that the home

31:41.934 --> 31:43.467
Of the viscountess
is no longer an option.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.003
She's learned
of olivia's reputation.

31:46.005 --> 31:47.271
But perhaps you could insist.

31:47.273 --> 31:48.605
I don't want to make olivia live

31:48.607 --> 31:50.040
With people
that will resent having her.

31:50.042 --> 31:52.209
But I resent having her.
I know.

31:52.211 --> 31:53.944
And I'll find her
somewhere else to stay.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.379
It just might take
a little time.

31:57.515 --> 31:59.616
Has something happened
between you two?

32:01.119 --> 32:02.519
(chuckles softly)

32:02.521 --> 32:06.523
Francis, tell me
or I'll imagine the worst.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.927
I stopped it.

32:09.929 --> 32:11.929
You stopped?

32:11.931 --> 32:13.997
What did you start?

32:14.966 --> 32:16.066
I want her gone.

32:16.068 --> 32:17.567
I'm working on it.
Now.

32:17.569 --> 32:19.236
I want her gone now.
You can't just
say that.

32:19.238 --> 32:21.171
You just told me
something happened.

32:21.173 --> 32:23.040
It won't happen again.
It's already
happened again.

32:23.042 --> 32:24.408
Mary, enough.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.645
She's staying,
and that's final.

32:28.647 --> 32:30.080
That's it, then?

32:30.082 --> 32:31.581
You can just decide?

32:31.583 --> 32:33.517
Yes, I can, actually.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.385
Because this is my court,
not yours.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.220
And I'm the future
king of France.

32:37.222 --> 32:38.956
And I'm your future queen.
Then you'll learn

32:38.958 --> 32:40.090
To respect my decisions.

32:40.092 --> 32:41.992
Respect goes both ways.

32:41.994 --> 32:44.494
I will not have a relationship
like your mother and father.

32:44.496 --> 32:46.630
I am nothing like my father,

32:46.632 --> 32:48.365
And for you
to suggest otherwise...

32:48.367 --> 32:50.100
Then why are you acting
like him?

32:50.102 --> 32:51.501
I'm not.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.136
If I was acting like my father,

32:53.138 --> 32:54.638
I would take olivia
as my mistress.

32:54.640 --> 32:57.107
Which is certainly
an option.

32:57.109 --> 33:00.143
Then don't let me stop you.

33:08.219 --> 33:10.354
I could use some of that.

33:11.222 --> 33:12.522
Everything all right?

33:12.524 --> 33:14.391
No, it isn't.

33:21.065 --> 33:22.499
(groans)

33:23.768 --> 33:25.736
(chuckling)

33:25.738 --> 33:28.538
I should probably
tell you to slow down.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.540
But you won't.

33:41.319 --> 33:43.020
Lola.

33:43.022 --> 33:44.254
Have you seen mary?

33:44.256 --> 33:45.655
No, I haven't.

33:45.657 --> 33:47.057
Is everything all right?

33:47.059 --> 33:48.358
I hope so.

33:48.360 --> 33:50.660
I lost my temper,
and I wish I hadn't.

33:51.729 --> 33:53.663
She irritates me
like no other.

33:53.665 --> 33:55.399
There's hope in that.

33:55.401 --> 33:57.434
Go and find her.

34:00.271 --> 34:02.806
It was so foolish of me

34:02.808 --> 34:07.411
To think that we could ever be
just a boy and just a girl.

34:07.413 --> 34:09.413
(sighs)
I mean, that implies

34:09.415 --> 34:12.049
That-that one is free to leave
if one is unhappy.

34:12.051 --> 34:15.318
And while I
am stuck here

34:15.320 --> 34:18.555
With-with no recourse, he's free
to do whatever he wants

34:18.557 --> 34:20.624
With whoever he wants.

34:22.326 --> 34:25.328
(gulps)
do you think I'm overreacting?

34:25.330 --> 34:26.830
Am I boring you?

34:26.832 --> 34:28.198
No.

34:28.200 --> 34:31.201
No, it's...
Unfathomable.

34:31.203 --> 34:32.469
What is?

34:32.471 --> 34:34.738
Francis has you.

34:34.740 --> 34:37.240
Why would
he ever look elsewhere?

34:40.078 --> 34:43.080
♪ going on

34:43.082 --> 34:47.084
♪ I'm in all the way

34:47.086 --> 34:50.420
♪ o-o-over

34:50.422 --> 34:53.457
I'm sorry.
I shouldn't have done that.

34:53.459 --> 34:54.724
You're right.

34:54.726 --> 34:56.326
I should have.

34:56.328 --> 35:02.299
♪ you're the first
to come around ♪

35:04.268 --> 35:07.137
♪ and say the way

35:07.139 --> 35:10.807
♪ I feel

35:10.809 --> 35:12.609
♪ oh.

35:18.149 --> 35:19.783
We... Shouldn't have done that.

35:19.785 --> 35:22.452
I was angry and-and you...

35:22.454 --> 35:23.653
(horns blowing in distance)

35:23.655 --> 35:26.656
They must be
launching the ships.

35:26.658 --> 35:28.658
Um, I should go.

35:28.660 --> 35:31.128
I'm sorry. That
was a mistake.

35:32.130 --> 35:34.297
(sighs)

35:34.299 --> 35:36.533
(indistinct chatter)

35:42.306 --> 35:45.375
My regrets are not hard
to summon.

35:47.211 --> 35:50.480
I'm sorry we fought.

35:50.482 --> 35:54.284
I'm sorry I didn't eat more
and drink less.

35:54.286 --> 35:57.821
I'm sorry I overreacted.

35:57.823 --> 36:00.557
Perhaps after this we can talk?

36:00.559 --> 36:02.292
No need.

36:02.294 --> 36:05.328
You've expressed your feelings
quite clearly.

36:08.866 --> 36:11.201
(chuckles)
your majesty.
Your majesty.

36:11.203 --> 36:14.538
You did well, delivering
mary's letters to me.

36:14.540 --> 36:17.541
Let's make it a
permanent arrangement.

36:17.543 --> 36:19.409
Oh, look.

36:19.411 --> 36:21.878
Oh, they're launching
their boats.

36:21.880 --> 36:24.881
(applause)

36:25.850 --> 36:28.585
Regrets are everywhere.

36:28.587 --> 36:30.320
How apt.

36:30.322 --> 36:31.721
(chuckles)

36:54.245 --> 36:56.580
Are you all right, mary?

36:56.582 --> 36:58.448
No.

36:58.450 --> 37:02.552
Regret is a terrible feeling.

37:02.554 --> 37:05.956
And though I've sent my ship
off, I am still filled with it.

37:10.628 --> 37:11.995
(sighs)
what now?

37:11.997 --> 37:13.363
Look, I've done
what you've asked.

37:13.365 --> 37:14.664
I've kept
my distance.

37:18.636 --> 37:20.904
I'll be married someday.

37:20.906 --> 37:23.607
Titled. And I don't want
to regret

37:23.609 --> 37:26.543
What I could have done
with my time here. My youth.

37:28.679 --> 37:30.847
No one can know about us.

37:39.790 --> 37:41.791
Oh, the attack on your carriage,

37:41.793 --> 37:43.793
Unfortunate though it was,

37:43.795 --> 37:46.896
Certainly lent your arrival
some drama.

37:46.898 --> 37:50.267
I had no idea, dear.

37:50.269 --> 37:53.436
Mm. Come...

37:53.438 --> 37:56.339
Where I can see you
and be sure of your recovery.

37:57.275 --> 37:58.808
Tell me.

37:58.810 --> 38:00.410
How's it going?

38:00.412 --> 38:01.678
(door shuts)

38:01.680 --> 38:03.913
It's horrible.

38:03.915 --> 38:05.915
I miss him

38:05.917 --> 38:08.585
And he's right
there. With mary.

38:08.587 --> 38:11.721
And I know I'm causing
her so much pain.

38:11.723 --> 38:13.890
I can make your family's life
very difficult

38:13.892 --> 38:15.425
Should you have second thoughts.

38:15.427 --> 38:17.494
Were you aggressive
with mary?

38:19.797 --> 38:21.665
I followed your guidance

38:21.667 --> 38:24.000
And she reacted as
you said she would.

38:24.002 --> 38:26.002
(chuckles)
she has a short temper.

38:26.004 --> 38:27.671
I like that about her.

38:27.673 --> 38:29.806
Francis won't.
He didn't.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.508
Oh.
(chuckles)

38:31.510 --> 38:33.510
Though he still speaks
of sending me off.

38:33.512 --> 38:35.512
Well, I'll take care of it,

38:35.514 --> 38:37.714
Just as I took care
of the paris problem.

38:37.716 --> 38:40.050
And once I break them up,
then what?

38:40.052 --> 38:41.985
I just go back home?

38:41.987 --> 38:44.354
I try to forget him again?

38:44.356 --> 38:46.556
My dear, you're not going home.

38:47.825 --> 38:50.827
Oh, don't
expect the worst.

38:50.829 --> 38:53.330
You're going to be
the next queen of France.

38:53.332 --> 38:56.599
You want me to marry francis?

38:56.601 --> 38:58.068
But you don't
even like me.

38:58.070 --> 39:00.737
I like you more than a queen
I can't control.

39:00.739 --> 39:03.406
My dear,

39:03.408 --> 39:05.475
I wasn't titled
when I married henry.

39:05.477 --> 39:07.477
I was just a rich
girl, like you.

39:07.479 --> 39:13.016
We are going to accomplish
so much together.

39:13.018 --> 39:16.419
So hurry along now
and get pregnant.

39:16.421 --> 39:21.091
I'm assuming you don't need
my guidance in that arena.

39:23.594 --> 39:25.595
I'm in.

39:25.597 --> 39:28.898
The queen wants me to continue
to give her your letters.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.601
Then I will keep
writing them.

39:31.603 --> 39:33.770
Stay close.

39:33.772 --> 39:37.040
I might have fallen
for her sad story,

39:37.042 --> 39:40.777
The pitiful truth
of her life.

39:40.779 --> 39:44.647
She is never, ever
on my side.

39:44.649 --> 39:48.418
She's behind olivia's return,
I'm sure of it.

39:53.724 --> 39:56.726
You've taken what
doesn't belong to you.

39:56.728 --> 39:59.996
Who are you?
Adding to a debt
you already owe.

40:00.931 --> 40:03.166
The blood in the wood.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.768
The blood.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.636
So you're aware.

40:06.638 --> 40:09.072
You took from its source
once before.

40:09.074 --> 40:12.041
I found the body of a scottish
boy hanging in the wood.

40:12.043 --> 40:13.643
I cut it down.

40:13.645 --> 40:15.879
And you were allowed
to go on your way.

40:16.814 --> 40:19.549
You're one of them.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.818
You're a monster, you know.

40:21.820 --> 40:23.486
Get down from there.

40:23.488 --> 40:25.722
He wasn't yours
to save, sebastian.

40:27.958 --> 40:29.058
How do you know my name?

40:29.060 --> 40:30.160
We all do now.

40:30.162 --> 40:31.528
Go ahead.

40:31.530 --> 40:33.897
My life is worth nothing.

40:33.899 --> 40:36.065
I've been seen.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.536
You owe a debt,
and you will pay.

40:39.538 --> 40:42.071
Choose someone to sacrifice.

40:42.073 --> 40:43.540
And if I refuse?

40:43.542 --> 40:45.475
Then we will choose for you.

40:46.677 --> 40:47.677
Do not be afraid.

40:47.679 --> 40:49.546
There is no fear.

40:49.548 --> 40:51.047
It is a privilege
to die in service

40:51.049 --> 40:53.817
Of something so much greater.
