00:04.330 --> 00:06.855
Mom, open the door! Please!

00:09.882 --> 00:13.151
Mom, open the door!

00:13.219 --> 00:15.971
Please don't, mom!
Please don't!

00:20.910 --> 00:22.861
Please don't. Please!

00:24.730 --> 00:27.916
Open the door! Please!

00:28.000 --> 00:30.168
Please don't, mom!

00:38.824 --> 00:40.724
Mom? Open the door.

00:44.363 --> 00:45.329
Mom!

00:48.233 --> 00:50.401
Open it!

00:52.737 --> 00:54.738
Mom, please.

00:56.291 --> 00:58.209

Come on.

01:12.974 --> 01:15.926
Come on, Bobby!

01:15.977 --> 01:17.428
Let's go.

01:18.763 --> 01:20.931
Let me stay with you.

01:20.982 --> 01:22.400
Oh, don't cry, sweetheart.

01:22.451 --> 01:23.617
Come on, please?

01:23.702 --> 01:25.870
I don't want
to do this again.

01:26.938 --> 01:32.159
I know, and I'm
so, so, so sorry.

01:32.244 --> 01:34.328
Everything's gonna be ok.

01:35.964 --> 01:37.631
It's ok.

01:41.636 --> 01:43.220
Go on.

02:00.822 --> 02:02.806
What are you doing here?

02:06.912 --> 02:09.747
Thank you.

02:09.814 --> 02:12.500
I am really sorry.
I had to take that.

02:12.584 --> 02:13.984
It's ok.

02:15.370 --> 02:17.654
Fruit plate, huh?

02:17.706 --> 02:20.218
Whatever happened to
the usual bacon and eggs,

02:20.243 --> 02:21.783
extra grease on the side?

02:22.094 --> 02:24.044
Well, I've changed.

02:25.497 --> 02:27.965
Ok, the cantaloupe
is for your benefit.

02:28.016 --> 02:30.196
When we were married,
you were always warning me

02:30.221 --> 02:31.786
about clogged arteries.

02:31.937 --> 02:34.138
And you would always
say to me...

02:34.189 --> 02:37.674
Nobody lives forever.

02:37.726 --> 02:38.859
So how's San Francisco?

02:38.944 --> 02:40.311
Well, you know.

02:40.362 --> 02:42.480
Fog, cable cars,
the usual.

02:42.531 --> 02:44.865
You know, I'm really glad
you called me.

02:44.950 --> 02:46.867
It would be nice
if we saw each other

02:46.952 --> 02:49.737
more than once
every 3 or 4 years.

02:50.872 --> 02:52.990
Maybe we can.

02:56.378 --> 02:58.329
So, give me the updates.

02:58.380 --> 03:00.164
Anybody serious
in your life?

03:00.215 --> 03:02.331
Well, there are all those 
serial killers.

03:02.356 --> 03:03.556
They're pretty serious.

03:03.919 --> 03:05.586
I meant
in your personal life.

03:05.670 --> 03:08.372
No, there isn't.

03:09.874 --> 03:10.975
How about you?

03:11.042 --> 03:13.060
Mm-mmm.

03:15.680 --> 03:18.432
You know, David...

03:19.684 --> 03:21.152
I've been wanting--

03:25.273 --> 03:26.407
Damn it, I--

03:26.491 --> 03:27.825
You gotta go.

03:27.892 --> 03:29.660
I know.

03:29.727 --> 03:31.779
It's ok.
It's comforting to know

03:31.863 --> 03:34.031
that some things
never change.

03:34.082 --> 03:36.167
Look, how much longer
are you gonna be in town?

03:36.234 --> 03:38.619
About a week or so,
probably.

03:38.703 --> 03:40.421
Why don't you come over
to my place for dinner

03:40.505 --> 03:42.039
before you head back?

03:42.090 --> 03:45.176
I still make
a monster cioppino.

03:46.595 --> 03:49.046
I would like that
very much.

03:49.097 --> 03:50.598
Great.

03:54.436 --> 03:56.353
Ciao.
Ciao.

04:00.692 --> 04:02.276
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late.

04:02.360 --> 04:04.278
I got hung up
with something.

04:04.362 --> 04:05.446
What do we got?

04:05.513 --> 04:06.897
A child abduction
in St. Louis.

04:06.948 --> 04:08.883
Yeah. Bobby Smith,
9 years old,

04:08.950 --> 04:10.934
vanished 48 hours ago
from a residential area,

04:10.986 --> 04:12.369
where his mother,
Marlene Smith,

04:12.437 --> 04:13.954
claims to have
dropped him off.

04:14.039 --> 04:15.906
48 hours and we're
just learning about it now?

04:15.957 --> 04:19.076
Yeah. That's 'cause mom didn't
know her son was gone.

04:19.127 --> 04:21.411
She assumed that he was
with the grandmother

04:21.463 --> 04:23.214
and just left him there.

04:23.281 --> 04:25.216
So, she's not exactly on the short
list for mother of the year.

04:25.283 --> 04:26.783
What about the father?

04:26.835 --> 04:29.786
Uh, he was convicted of embezzling
from his workplace 2 years ago.

04:29.838 --> 04:31.889
Currently cooling his heels
in state prison.

04:31.956 --> 04:34.791
If it's a stranger abduction,
the first 24 hours are critical.

04:34.843 --> 04:36.894
This kid's already been
missing twice that long.

04:36.961 --> 04:39.530
Which is why we shouldn't
waste any more time. Let's go.

04:46.321 --> 04:47.971
I brought you something
to eat, Bobby.

04:48.023 --> 04:49.306
Gotta go to work now.

04:49.357 --> 04:51.775
When can I see my mom?

04:53.945 --> 04:56.080
I already told you.

04:56.147 --> 04:58.749
We'll talk about
your mom later.

04:58.816 --> 05:00.701
No! Don't go!

Edgar Allan Poe.

05:44.471 --> 05:45.387
St. Louis.

05:45.455 --> 05:47.055
Oh, probably a couple days.

05:47.140 --> 05:49.308
I'll let you know.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.642
Can't wait.

05:50.710 --> 05:52.227
Bye.

05:55.315 --> 05:56.431
What?

05:56.516 --> 05:58.233
Nothing. Just somebody's
got a lot of extra pep

05:58.318 --> 05:59.768
in their step this
morning, that's all.

05:59.853 --> 06:01.854
Probably doubled up
on his vitamins.

06:01.905 --> 06:03.438
Oh, he doubled up
on something.

06:04.524 --> 06:06.275
Garcia, what have you
got on the mother?

06:06.359 --> 06:07.943
Oh, I have so much
on the mother,

06:08.027 --> 06:09.862
and try as I might,
none of it is good.

06:09.913 --> 06:12.197
Marlene Smith has a history
of erratic behavior,

06:12.248 --> 06:14.032
seriously clinically depressed,

06:14.083 --> 06:16.051
two suicide attempts
in the last 5 years.

06:16.119 --> 06:18.403
Was she being treated
for her depression?

06:18.454 --> 06:19.738
Oh, my gosh, yes.

06:19.789 --> 06:21.840
Like more pill-popping
than Elvis. Yes.

06:21.908 --> 06:23.709
Depression is
one of the few things

06:23.760 --> 06:25.627
that can overwhelm
the maternal instinct.

06:25.712 --> 06:27.095
What about the grandmother?

06:27.180 --> 06:28.580
I don't have anything
on her yet,

06:28.631 --> 06:30.265
but don't reach
for your remote.

06:30.350 --> 06:32.034
I'll be ba-a-ck.

06:32.101 --> 06:33.268
Two suicide attempts.

06:33.353 --> 06:35.086
Why hasn't child services
intervened?

06:35.138 --> 06:36.889
Probably talked
her way out of it.

06:36.940 --> 06:38.891
Most social service
organizations

06:38.942 --> 06:41.393
are overworked and underfunded.
Things slip through the cracks.

06:41.444 --> 06:43.445
If this boy's mother
tried to commit suicide

06:43.530 --> 06:45.447
and he's from a chronically
unhappy household.

06:45.532 --> 06:47.282
Maybe this wasn't
an abduction at all.

06:47.367 --> 06:48.450
What if Bobby
simply ran away?

06:48.535 --> 06:49.952
When 9-year-olds run away,

06:50.036 --> 06:51.870
they're usually home
for supper.

06:51.938 --> 06:54.373
JJ, you and I
will talk to the mother.

06:54.440 --> 06:55.874
Morgan and Reid,
go to the boy's house.

06:55.942 --> 06:57.776
Prentiss, you and Dave
assess the site

06:57.827 --> 06:59.828
where the mother claims
to have dropped him off.

07:09.455 --> 07:11.890
Detective Woods.
Glad to have you here.

07:11.958 --> 07:13.225
This is Agent Jareau.

07:13.292 --> 07:14.259
Agent.

07:14.310 --> 07:15.561
How's the mother doing?

07:15.628 --> 07:16.762
She's a wreck.

07:16.813 --> 07:18.680
Can't get much from her
till she calms down.

07:18.765 --> 07:21.099
I think you should
talk to her alone.

07:21.150 --> 07:22.351
Ok.

07:22.435 --> 07:23.435
I'll leave you to it.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.136
I'll watch from here.

07:27.190 --> 07:29.307
Mrs. Smith?

07:29.359 --> 07:31.276
I'm Agent Jareau.

07:31.327 --> 07:32.744
Jennifer.

07:32.812 --> 07:34.947
I'm with the FBI.

07:34.998 --> 07:37.816
Did you hear any more
about my Bobby?

07:37.867 --> 07:40.285
No, ma'am.

07:40.336 --> 07:41.920
But our entire team
is here

07:41.988 --> 07:44.089
and we're the best
at what we do.

07:44.156 --> 07:46.875
We're gonna need
your help, ok?

07:46.960 --> 07:50.245
Ok.

07:50.313 --> 07:52.297
I have a boy of my own.

07:52.348 --> 07:53.799
He's almost 3.

07:53.850 --> 07:58.720
I can't even imagine
what you are going through.

07:58.788 --> 08:00.839
He's so little.

08:00.890 --> 08:02.173
I know.

08:03.643 --> 08:05.727
Can you tell me
what happened

08:05.812 --> 08:08.397
the morning
you dropped him off?

08:08.481 --> 08:10.849
I was having
one of my bad days.

08:10.900 --> 08:13.118
And what does one of
your bad days look like?

08:13.185 --> 08:15.520
I wanted to hurt myself.

08:17.023 --> 08:19.625
I can't control it.

08:19.692 --> 08:22.127
Is that why you took him
to his grandmother?

08:22.194 --> 08:25.631
Yeah. See,
I have to protect him.

08:25.698 --> 08:27.532
And you had done this
in the past?

08:27.583 --> 08:29.718
Yeah.

08:31.754 --> 08:33.705
I just had to get him
out of the house.

08:33.756 --> 08:35.941
You know? I just had to
get him out of the house.

08:36.009 --> 08:37.926
It's all I kept thinking about
was just get him out.

08:38.010 --> 08:40.429
Get him out!

08:46.185 --> 08:48.103
Cheerful.

08:50.857 --> 08:52.441
Depression
is a vicious cycle.

08:52.525 --> 08:54.943
It frequently manifests itself
in the degradation

08:55.028 --> 08:56.662
of one's personal
living environment,

08:56.729 --> 08:58.664
which in turn fuels
the depression,

08:58.731 --> 09:00.231
which then worsens
the living environment.

09:00.283 --> 09:01.566
All right, I'll take a look
around in here.

09:01.617 --> 09:03.001
Why don't you check out
the kitchen?

09:03.069 --> 09:04.736
Ah, the kitchen.

09:04.787 --> 09:06.071
Is that a problem?

09:06.122 --> 09:07.572
Frankly, I'm not
too anxious to see

09:07.623 --> 09:11.126
the perishable food
version of this room.

09:24.307 --> 09:26.191
So when I was
feeling better,

09:26.258 --> 09:28.426
I went to my mother's
to pick him up,

09:28.478 --> 09:32.731
and...that's when they told me
he wasn't there.

09:32.782 --> 09:36.535
You didn't call ahead
before you dropped him off?

09:36.602 --> 09:38.103
Yeah. She didn't answer.

09:38.154 --> 09:40.572
She didn't have
an answering machine?

09:40.623 --> 09:43.658
Yeah, she has, but there wasn't
time for that.

09:43.743 --> 09:48.380
Please help me understand,
Mrs. Smith.

09:48.447 --> 09:51.717
It takes 10 seconds
to leave a message.

09:53.953 --> 09:58.473
Look, these bad days
you have I understand.

09:58.558 --> 10:01.259
There--there must be
times when--

10:01.310 --> 10:03.128
Look!

10:05.231 --> 10:07.465
Bobby saw me do this before.

10:07.517 --> 10:10.301
Twice.

10:10.353 --> 10:12.904
I had to get him
out of the house.

10:12.972 --> 10:15.306
Don't you understand?

10:15.358 --> 10:17.526
Ok.

10:26.202 --> 10:27.953
Four pair of shoes.

10:28.004 --> 10:29.654
Why exactly
is that relevant?

10:29.705 --> 10:31.156
Come on, Reid,
how many women you know

10:31.207 --> 10:32.824
only have 4 pairs of shoes
in their closet?

10:32.875 --> 10:34.993
My experience in and around
women's closets

10:35.044 --> 10:37.495
isn't exactly extensive enough
to really formulate an opinion.

10:37.547 --> 10:40.382
The answer is none.
You can take my word for it.

10:41.884 --> 10:43.335
Well...

10:43.402 --> 10:46.337
She even set up a separate area
so he could do his homework.

10:48.057 --> 10:50.793
Mom has serious financial
issues, denies herself

10:50.818 --> 10:52.717
even the smallest luxury,
and yet...

10:52.728 --> 10:55.013
Splurges to take her son
to an expensive theme park

10:55.064 --> 10:56.347
and then buys
a pricey picture frame

10:56.399 --> 10:59.484
so he can remember
the experience.

11:02.038 --> 11:03.121
Hey, buddy.

11:03.189 --> 11:06.324
After work I stopped
and got you something.

11:07.526 --> 11:09.127
120 colors.

11:09.195 --> 11:13.131
The biggest box they had.

11:13.199 --> 11:16.084
I want to go home now.

11:25.678 --> 11:29.147
I need to ask you
something, Bobby.

11:29.215 --> 11:33.518
Your mother,
she's unhappy a lot.

11:33.569 --> 11:36.188
Would you like it
if her pain could stop?

11:36.239 --> 11:38.106
'Cause I can
make that happen.

11:41.277 --> 11:44.162
Do you want me
to help your mom?

11:49.335 --> 11:51.586
That's good, Bobby.

11:51.671 --> 11:54.072
That means you're strong,

11:54.123 --> 11:55.757
like me.

11:55.842 --> 11:59.094
You made the right decision.

12:00.096 --> 12:01.963
Wait, where are you going?

12:03.015 --> 12:04.415
To help your mom.

12:06.152 --> 12:08.603
Why don't you draw a picture
while I'm gone.

12:17.914 --> 12:19.915
Mother's not a suspect
anymore?

12:19.982 --> 12:23.068
Based on our assessment,
we need to reprioritize.

12:23.119 --> 12:25.320
The concern for her son
was genuine.

12:25.404 --> 12:27.038
Her tone of voice,
body language.

12:27.106 --> 12:28.439
She didn't once ask
if she was in trouble,

12:28.491 --> 12:31.076
under arrest, where's my lawyer?
None of that.

12:31.127 --> 12:33.211
Home environment points
the same direction.

12:33.279 --> 12:35.280
The money's tight, but mom
did whatever she could

12:35.331 --> 12:37.382
to create a nice world
for her son.

12:37.449 --> 12:38.800
Whatever cash she had
she spent on him.

12:38.885 --> 12:40.835
Only 4 pairs of shoes
in her closet.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.305
And she taught her son
to be self-sufficient.

12:43.389 --> 12:45.323
The kitchen was scaled down
to a 9-year-old's level

12:45.391 --> 12:47.616
so he could microwave
his own meals, get food

12:47.641 --> 12:49.241
and utensils from the pantry.

12:49.295 --> 12:50.365
He even had his own little
key ring so he could

12:50.390 --> 12:51.590
come and go as he pleased.

12:52.431 --> 12:53.398
How'd it go.

12:53.465 --> 12:54.482
It took a while,

12:54.567 --> 12:55.934
but grandma's
alibi checked out.

12:55.985 --> 12:57.435
She was with two
lady friends in Seneca,

12:57.486 --> 12:58.687
other side of the state.

12:58.771 --> 13:00.789
Acquaintances, relatives,
teachers.

13:00.856 --> 13:02.407
So far they've all
checked out.

13:02.474 --> 13:04.270
This is starting to look
more and more like

13:04.295 --> 13:05.495
a stranger abduction.

13:05.611 --> 13:07.862
Yeah, except the area
Bobby disappeared from

13:07.947 --> 13:09.698
has a decent amount
of foot traffic.

13:09.782 --> 13:12.267
If he'd put up a struggle, chances
are someone would have noticed.

13:12.335 --> 13:14.286
My guess is Bobby
knew his abductor

13:14.337 --> 13:15.820
or trusted him.

13:15.871 --> 13:18.957
The trip to grandma's house was
a spur-of-the-moment decision.

13:19.008 --> 13:21.304
The unsub must have been
staking out the mother's house,

13:21.329 --> 13:22.427
saw them leaving, and followed.

13:22.428 --> 13:24.512
Self-sufficient kids learn
to trust their own judgment.

13:24.597 --> 13:26.798
How did the unsub
get into Bobby's life?

13:26.849 --> 13:29.851
And what's he trying
to accomplish?

13:31.854 --> 13:34.356
[Humming "Pop Goes
the Weasel"]

13:44.200 --> 13:46.851
Excuse me, ma'am.

13:46.902 --> 13:47.852
Mrs. Smith?

13:47.903 --> 13:50.488
I know where
your son is.

13:50.539 --> 13:51.489
What?

13:51.540 --> 13:52.991
Where?

13:53.042 --> 13:55.043
I can take you to him.

14:00.750 --> 14:04.719
[Humming "Pop Goes
the Weasel"]

14:53.268 --> 14:55.480
There's something strange
about the body.

14:55.481 --> 14:57.432
She was slaughtered by someone
completely out of control,

14:57.483 --> 14:59.634
yet on her wrists
there are precise wounds

14:59.685 --> 15:02.403
on top of where she already
cut herself, only deeper.

15:02.471 --> 15:03.488
Like he was trying
to replicate

15:03.572 --> 15:06.241
her suicide attempts
but then lost control.

15:06.308 --> 15:08.409
Maybe this was never about the
kid at all, but about the mother.

15:08.477 --> 15:11.579
Make her suffer for a few days
by taking the child, then kill her?

15:11.647 --> 15:13.364
It means he knew
her personal history.

15:13.449 --> 15:15.149
I'll call Garcia.

15:19.488 --> 15:22.290
Hey, baby girl, whatever
you're doing, drop it.

15:22.341 --> 15:24.542
Oh, yes, and with pleasure.

15:24.627 --> 15:26.160
Let me tell you something,
sweetheart.

15:26.212 --> 15:28.557
This is a Lamborghini
you are talking to.

15:28.582 --> 15:29.714
You have to drive me.

15:29.715 --> 15:32.100
You can't just leave me
parked in the garage

15:32.167 --> 15:34.001
collecting dust
or I will wilt.

15:34.053 --> 15:35.770
Please forgive my neglect.

15:35.838 --> 15:38.294
I need you to rev up
that fine-tuned Italian

15:38.319 --> 15:39.307
engine of yours, then.

15:39.308 --> 15:40.508
Revving.

15:40.559 --> 15:42.610
Our unsub had personal
details about Marlene Smith,

15:42.678 --> 15:44.813
so I need you to figure out who might
have been in her house recently.

15:44.864 --> 15:46.848
Cable guy, plumber,
people like that.

15:46.899 --> 15:48.316
Yeah, I always wonder
about plumbers.

15:48.367 --> 15:50.846
You know they peek in
your medicine cabinet.

15:50.872 --> 15:51.703
You just know it.

15:51.704 --> 15:54.021
Maybe try a phone repairman
or a babysitter.

15:54.073 --> 15:55.790
Check computers
in the house.

15:55.858 --> 15:58.111
Maybe she used of of those
techie fix-it type dweebs

15:58.136 --> 15:59.043
who makes house calls.

15:59.044 --> 16:00.411
Hey, watch it. Language.

16:00.496 --> 16:01.996
You know I'm just
playing with you,

16:02.047 --> 16:03.798
but come on, put a rush on it.
Clock's ticking, ok?

16:03.866 --> 16:05.667
Rush is the only speed
a Lamborghini has.

16:05.718 --> 16:07.752
Proud techie dweeb over and out.
Beep beep ya.

16:09.037 --> 16:11.639
Agent Hotchner.

16:11.707 --> 16:13.474
We had another
child abduction.

16:13.542 --> 16:16.344
A 4-year-old boy taken from a
park about a half an hour ago.

16:16.395 --> 16:18.313
Just a couple miles
from here.

16:18.380 --> 16:20.765
Morgan and Reid,
head over there.

16:20.850 --> 16:23.985
I was sitting on the bench,

16:24.052 --> 16:26.988
and he was playing
right there.

16:27.055 --> 16:28.823
I looked away for two seconds.

16:28.891 --> 16:31.576
Were you by yourself?

16:31.660 --> 16:33.745
You told the police you live
in McKinley Heights.

16:33.829 --> 16:35.530
That's almost an hour away.

16:35.581 --> 16:38.199
You drove your son all
the way out here to play?

16:38.250 --> 16:41.336
I was doing things.

16:41.403 --> 16:43.004
Shopping.

16:44.456 --> 16:45.907
Why are they looking here?

16:45.958 --> 16:48.576
My son isn't here.

16:48.627 --> 16:50.929
Mrs. Tanner, please don't
take this the wrong way,

16:51.013 --> 16:54.632
but exactly what drug
are you addicted to?

16:54.717 --> 16:56.718
You're displaying
symptoms of withdrawal.

16:56.769 --> 16:58.269
Are you crazy?

16:58.354 --> 17:00.663
Ma'am, we saw two deals
going down on the other

17:00.688 --> 17:01.982
side of the park
when we arrived.

17:01.983 --> 17:03.110
You were here to buy,
weren't you?

17:03.111 --> 17:04.444
That's what
had you distracted.

17:04.526 --> 17:07.428
I can't believe that you
actually think I would--

17:07.479 --> 17:10.431
Your child is missing,
Ms. Tanner.

17:10.482 --> 17:12.650
Every minute,
every half-minute counts.

17:12.734 --> 17:15.435
You need to tell us the truth
and you need to tell us now.

17:16.939 --> 17:19.958
This will be your bed
up here, Timmy.

17:21.542 --> 17:25.163
Bunk beds are cool.
This'll be the boys only room.

17:25.247 --> 17:28.215
Look, I got you some
new pajamas.

17:28.282 --> 17:29.667
I want my mommy!

17:29.752 --> 17:32.387
I want my mommy!

17:32.454 --> 17:34.472
Fine!

17:37.393 --> 17:39.477
- You want to be a baby?
- I want my mommy!

17:39.561 --> 17:43.064
You sit there and cry
like a baby for your mommy!

17:43.131 --> 17:46.067
I want my mommy.

17:46.134 --> 17:48.102
Mommy!

17:48.153 --> 17:49.821
Yeah, Hotch, the mother's
addicted to Oxy.

17:49.905 --> 17:51.439
She was out here to buy.

17:51.490 --> 17:52.941
All right, let's put her
in protective custody.

17:52.992 --> 17:55.576
So we got one mom suicidal and
the other one addicted to drugs.

17:55.644 --> 17:56.911
At least we got a pattern
developing.

17:56.979 --> 17:58.780
And if the unsub
holds to pattern,

17:58.831 --> 18:01.199
he's gonna circle back
and try to kill her.

18:04.753 --> 18:06.287
I want my mommy!

18:06.338 --> 18:07.822
I shouldn't have gotten mad
in there like that with Timmy.

18:07.873 --> 18:09.290
Let me out!

18:09.341 --> 18:11.626
That was wrong.

18:11.677 --> 18:13.995
But he's got a mommy
like yours.

18:14.046 --> 18:15.630
Weak.

18:15.681 --> 18:17.632
Help! Mommy!

18:17.683 --> 18:19.350
When can I go home?

18:20.853 --> 18:22.303
This is your home now.

18:22.354 --> 18:24.772
You'll be safe and happy here.

18:25.941 --> 18:29.227
I want my mommy!

18:35.200 --> 18:38.453
Where is my mom?

18:38.520 --> 18:42.657
I took your mom to a place
where she'll be happier.

18:42.708 --> 18:46.160
That's what you said
you wanted.

18:46.211 --> 18:47.628
No.

18:52.251 --> 18:53.885
Do you think wolves are bad?

18:57.840 --> 18:59.507
People say they are,
but they're not.

18:59.558 --> 19:02.010
They kill other animals
for a reason--

19:02.061 --> 19:04.312
to get rid of the sick
and the weak.

19:04.379 --> 19:05.480
Let me out!

19:05.547 --> 19:06.814
Thin the herd.

19:06.882 --> 19:08.149
I want my mommy!

19:08.216 --> 19:09.767
So the herd can be stronger.

19:09.852 --> 19:11.719
It's the way of nature.

19:11.770 --> 19:15.523
And they--they even kill
other wolves sometimes,

19:15.574 --> 19:17.525
when they're weak or sick.

19:17.576 --> 19:20.528
But the nice thing is,

19:20.579 --> 19:22.246
wolves always take care
of any cubs

19:22.331 --> 19:24.248
who don't have moms
or dads.

19:24.333 --> 19:27.118
Let me out!

19:27.202 --> 19:28.119
Help!

19:28.187 --> 19:30.121
When I was bringing
Timothy over,

19:30.205 --> 19:31.906
I asked him the same thing
I asked you.

19:31.957 --> 19:35.409
Did he want me to make
things better with his mommy?

19:36.845 --> 19:38.746
And he said yes.

19:38.797 --> 19:40.882
As little as he is,

19:40.933 --> 19:42.633
he said yes.

19:42.718 --> 19:45.386
I want my mommy!

19:45.437 --> 19:47.688
It's an instinct.

19:47.756 --> 19:49.807
He knows.

19:56.482 --> 19:58.432
Here's a snack for you guys.

19:58.484 --> 20:00.101
I just gotta go out

20:00.152 --> 20:02.737
for a little while.

20:07.743 --> 20:09.660
We're looking for
a male unsub

20:09.745 --> 20:11.329
in his mid- to late 20s,

20:11.413 --> 20:13.247
physically fit enough
to subdue Marlene Smith

20:13.298 --> 20:15.616
and carry out a vicious
and sustained attack.

20:15.667 --> 20:18.336
We believe he sees
himself as a rescuer,

20:18.420 --> 20:20.555
taking children away
from unfit parents.

20:20.622 --> 20:22.637
He may very well have
abandonment issues

20:22.663 --> 20:23.508
from his own childhood.

20:23.509 --> 20:26.511
The impulsive nature of committing
the murder out in the open

20:26.595 --> 20:28.062
suggests that
he's inexperienced.

20:28.130 --> 20:30.631
The violence on Marlene Smith
went from precision to frenzy,

20:30.682 --> 20:33.651
which points to someone with
classic psychopathic traits,

20:33.735 --> 20:35.269
quick to rage
and quick to recover.

20:35.320 --> 20:38.022
He also appears
to have insider knowledge

20:38.107 --> 20:40.074
of the families in these cases,

20:40.142 --> 20:42.143
so we need to look for someone
who is privy

20:42.194 --> 20:43.778
to what went on
behind those closed doors.

20:43.829 --> 20:46.313
Emergency personnel
were called to the Smith house

20:46.365 --> 20:48.866
after both suicide attempts
and once to the Tanner house

20:48.951 --> 20:51.819
after the mother overdosed
on prescription drugs.

20:51.870 --> 20:54.388
That means first responders,
child service workers,

20:54.413 --> 20:55.489
ambulance personnel.

20:55.490 --> 20:58.101
Both missing children
apparently went without

20:58.126 --> 20:59.093
struggle or protest.

20:59.094 --> 21:01.162
That makes us think
that they had prior contact

21:01.213 --> 21:02.680
with the person
we're looking for.

21:02.764 --> 21:06.684
Or they inherently trust who
he is by virtue of his job,

21:06.768 --> 21:09.336
the uniform he wears--
doctor, mailman, policeman.

21:09.388 --> 21:11.839
So far the violence has been
directed to the offending parent,

21:11.890 --> 21:14.108
but we don't know
what the unsub's end game is.

21:17.563 --> 21:19.346
We have written up
a media release

21:19.398 --> 21:21.699
on precautions
the public needs to take.

21:21.783 --> 21:24.018
And we've taken the second
mother into protective custody,

21:24.069 --> 21:26.520
Mommy!
Thus depriving him of his target.

21:26.572 --> 21:28.623
This will increase
his volatility.

21:28.690 --> 21:30.575
That's why it's critical
we find these kids.

21:30.659 --> 21:33.327
If they are alive,
he may turn his violence

21:33.378 --> 21:34.662
against the children themselves.

21:34.713 --> 21:36.530
I want my mommy!

21:36.582 --> 21:38.833
I want to go home!

21:38.884 --> 21:41.085
I want my mommy!

21:41.170 --> 21:42.870
I want my mommy!

21:42.921 --> 21:44.639
Don't hurt him!

22:03.225 --> 22:05.243
Thank God you found him.

22:05.327 --> 22:06.494
We got lucky.

22:06.561 --> 22:08.362
Whoever took him
let him go.

22:08.413 --> 22:09.497
Is he ok?

22:09.564 --> 22:11.232
Your son was checked out
by a pediatrician.

22:11.283 --> 22:14.252
There was no sexual
or physical abuse.

22:14.336 --> 22:16.370
I can't believe
my wife let this happen.

22:16.421 --> 22:18.289
I need a drink.

22:22.461 --> 22:24.745
Did you see another
little boy there?

22:24.796 --> 22:26.047
Uh-huh.

22:26.098 --> 22:27.181
His name was Bobby.

22:27.249 --> 22:28.182
Is he ok?

22:28.250 --> 22:29.433
Mm-hmm.

22:29.518 --> 22:31.686
Good.

22:31.753 --> 22:34.939
Were you in a dark place
or did it have windows?

22:35.023 --> 22:36.257
It was a house.

22:36.308 --> 22:38.092
Ok.

22:38.143 --> 22:39.927
So when he took you,

22:39.978 --> 22:43.114
did you drive in the car
for a long time

22:43.198 --> 22:44.448
or a short time?

22:44.533 --> 22:45.900
I don't know.

22:45.951 --> 22:49.453
Can you tell us
what the man looked like?

22:49.538 --> 22:51.989
I don't know.

22:52.074 --> 22:53.157
Timothy.

22:53.242 --> 22:56.877
When this man came
to the park to get you,

22:56.945 --> 22:58.045
were you afraid?

22:58.113 --> 22:59.046
No.

22:59.114 --> 23:00.047
Why not?

23:00.115 --> 23:01.832
He said he would come,

23:01.917 --> 23:03.334
on the phone.

23:03.418 --> 23:06.220
The phone. You talked to him
on the telephone?

23:06.288 --> 23:08.139
He's a superhero.

23:11.626 --> 23:15.146
Can you show us?

23:31.997 --> 23:35.283
911 operator.
Please state your emergency.

23:36.318 --> 23:37.251
911 operator.

23:44.593 --> 23:47.511
911 operator.
State your emergency.

23:47.596 --> 23:48.846
You've gotta
send somebody.

23:48.930 --> 23:50.181
He tried to attack me.

23:50.265 --> 23:51.182
Who did?

23:51.266 --> 23:52.183
My mom's boyfriend.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.801
What's your name?

23:53.852 --> 23:54.802
Shannon.

23:54.853 --> 23:56.003
Shannon Barton.

23:56.054 --> 23:57.138
How old are you?

23:57.189 --> 23:59.206
13. Please,

23:59.274 --> 24:00.641
please send somebody.

24:00.692 --> 24:03.144
He's drunk and my mom
won't do anything about it.

24:03.195 --> 24:05.863
Are you still at 788
4th Avenue, apartment C?

24:05.947 --> 24:07.948
Yes. Hurry.

24:08.016 --> 24:10.017
Help is on the way, Shannon.

24:40.240 --> 24:43.167
Garcia, any progress
with the 911 dispatcher?

24:43.348 --> 24:45.233
I'm going as fast as I can,
which is super fast.

24:45.317 --> 24:47.936
There are literally hundreds
in the great St. Louis area.

24:48.003 --> 24:49.404
Can you help me
narrow this down?

24:49.488 --> 24:53.241
Refine your search to males
between 25 and 30 years of age.

24:53.325 --> 24:55.693
And our unsub probably
has abandonment issues,

24:55.745 --> 24:57.695
so look for backgrounds
that reflect that.

24:57.747 --> 24:59.748
A history of foster care

24:59.832 --> 25:01.916
or someone who was farmed out
to other relatives

25:01.984 --> 25:03.251
by his own parents.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.587
Can you trace individual
911 dispatchers

25:05.671 --> 25:07.705
based on calls they
would have received?

25:07.757 --> 25:09.591
Ok, look, let me
make this clear.

25:09.675 --> 25:11.926
There are a quarter
of a billion 911 calls annually.

25:12.011 --> 25:14.929
That's like 10 calls
every second of every day.

25:15.014 --> 25:16.848
And non-emergent calls
are disposed of quickly.

25:16.899 --> 25:19.651
Well, this operator would have been
on duty when both calls came in

25:19.718 --> 25:21.385
from the Smith
and Tanner families.

25:21.437 --> 25:24.406
And he would have been off duty
at the times of the two abductions

25:24.490 --> 25:26.524
and Marlene Smith's murder.

25:26.575 --> 25:29.110
Oh, my God. This brings needle in a
haystack to a whole other dimension,

25:29.195 --> 25:31.490
but I will go to that dimension
and I will cross-reference

25:31.515 --> 25:32.715
and I will call you back.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.836
A mother who wants
to kill herself.

25:37.903 --> 25:40.171
What does that say
to a child?

25:40.239 --> 25:42.674
That you're not worth
sticking around for?

25:42.741 --> 25:44.626
A 911 operator

25:44.710 --> 25:47.411
would be why
the kids trusted him.

25:47.463 --> 25:49.413
The unsub must have gone
back to the house

25:49.465 --> 25:51.415
to do some sort
of follow-up on his own

25:51.467 --> 25:53.017
and they remembered
his face.

25:54.804 --> 25:56.354
Rossi?

25:56.422 --> 25:58.440
Did you hear me?

25:58.524 --> 26:00.424
Oh. Sorry.

26:00.476 --> 26:04.479
Uh...Morgan and I were
joking around on the jet,

26:04.563 --> 26:07.198
but something
is definitely up.

26:07.266 --> 26:09.701
Is there anything
you want to share?

26:09.768 --> 26:12.120
It's nothing that...

26:15.491 --> 26:19.277
I had breakfast with Carolyn
the other morning.

26:19.328 --> 26:21.112
Carolyn.

26:21.163 --> 26:24.299
Oh! Is that wife
number 4 or 5?

26:24.383 --> 26:26.167
Look, let's get
our facts straight.

26:26.252 --> 26:28.419
I only had 3 wives.

26:28.471 --> 26:31.756
I mean, that's within
the realm of reasonable.

26:31.807 --> 26:32.957
Ok. I'm sorry.

26:33.008 --> 26:34.792
Which one was Carolyn?

26:34.844 --> 26:36.678
Numero uno.

26:36.762 --> 26:38.897
Mmm, ah.

26:38.964 --> 26:42.133
Use your words, Emily.

26:42.184 --> 26:46.304
Uh...there's always
something about the first,

26:46.355 --> 26:47.939
in anything.

26:47.990 --> 26:50.942
I don't know, I might be
way off here,

26:50.993 --> 26:53.528
but I think she's putting
some feelers out

26:53.612 --> 26:57.081
to see if that old spark
is still there.

26:57.149 --> 26:59.033
Is it?

27:01.170 --> 27:06.324
I'm having her over to my house
for dinner when I get back.

27:06.375 --> 27:08.376
I'm crazy, right?

27:10.162 --> 27:13.882
We don't always get
second chances in life, Rossi.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.550
I say take the plunge,

27:15.634 --> 27:16.935
see where it goes.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.275
Come with me, sir.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.277
Don't take him, don't take him.
He didn't do anything.

27:26.345 --> 27:27.779
He said
he didn't do anything.

27:27.846 --> 27:30.848
She--she makes stuff up.
Shannon, tell them you made a mistake.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.852
Uh, I'll take my own car.

27:44.630 --> 27:45.630
Come on, let's go.

27:45.697 --> 27:46.631
Don't touch me.

27:46.698 --> 27:47.715
Why did you call the police?

27:47.800 --> 27:49.050
He said he didn't do anything.

27:49.134 --> 27:50.552
He came into my bedroom
and grabbed me.

27:50.636 --> 27:52.420
Honey, he was in there
for another reason.

27:52.504 --> 27:53.671
He has me. Why--

27:53.722 --> 27:54.923
I hate you!

27:56.141 --> 27:57.508
Shannon.

28:09.554 --> 28:11.105
Talk to me, mama.

28:11.190 --> 28:14.192
First off, you are on restriction
from my inner Lamborghini.

28:14.243 --> 28:15.410
Garcia--

28:15.494 --> 28:18.029
I mean it.
This high-performance engine

28:18.080 --> 28:19.447
may purr like a puma
on the prowl,

28:19.531 --> 28:20.924
but this time, Derek,
you have seriously

28:20.949 --> 28:22.149
overheated my engines

28:22.534 --> 28:24.936
and I will require some
cool-down laps upon your return,

28:25.004 --> 28:26.254
if you know
what I mean by that.

28:26.338 --> 28:28.006
Baby girl,
you're on speaker.

28:28.073 --> 28:30.375
I knew that.

28:30.426 --> 28:33.461
I'm calling to tell you, sir,

28:33.545 --> 28:35.513
there are 11
911 dispatchers

28:35.580 --> 28:38.700
in the greater St. Louis area
that were on duty

28:38.767 --> 28:40.385
when the calls were placed

28:40.436 --> 28:42.770
but not working during
the murder and abduction.

28:42.855 --> 28:44.772
Of those 11, there's one
that fits your profile--

28:44.857 --> 28:47.892
George Kelling, age 27,
1181 Clay Street,

28:47.943 --> 28:50.094
apartment 8.
Sending his picture right now.

28:50.162 --> 28:51.696
Do you know
where he is now?

28:51.763 --> 28:53.231
He was scheduled to work today.
His supervisor said

28:53.282 --> 28:55.116
he showed up for his shift,
but then he left early.

28:55.200 --> 28:58.036
Can you get the log of all
the calls he took tonight?

28:58.103 --> 28:59.770
Yeah, of course.
But there are a lot.

28:59.822 --> 29:01.072
Skip to the last one.

29:01.123 --> 29:04.859
Last one is a domestic
disturbance

29:04.927 --> 29:08.746
at 788 4th Avenue, number C.

29:08.797 --> 29:10.081
Attempted sexual assault
of a young girl.

29:10.132 --> 29:11.949
Kelling dispatched the police
and then he took off.

29:12.001 --> 29:13.885
Let's go.

29:13.952 --> 29:15.920
Don't walk away from me
when I'm talking to you.

29:15.971 --> 29:16.862
You're not my boss.

29:16.887 --> 29:19.016
You know what? Just go
be with your boyfriend.

29:19.174 --> 29:20.591
The police said you had to
come to the station,

29:20.643 --> 29:24.062
so go get your stuff
so we can go. Now!

29:24.129 --> 29:26.064
What do you want?

29:26.131 --> 29:28.766
I'm here to do some follow-up,
make sure everything's ok.

29:28.817 --> 29:29.829
Everything's fine.
We just need to be

29:29.854 --> 29:31.054
left alone right now.

29:34.156 --> 29:35.590
Ohh!

29:35.658 --> 29:37.275
Everything's not fine,
Mrs. Barton.

29:37.326 --> 29:39.027
Mom!
Oh, my God.

29:46.651 --> 29:48.953
Clear!

29:49.004 --> 29:50.421
It's clear.

29:50.489 --> 29:52.290
The door's open
and the lights are on.

29:52.341 --> 29:53.958
The unsub beat us here.
What have you got?

29:54.009 --> 29:55.993
Nothing.
The place is empty.

29:56.045 --> 29:57.328
If the unsub's
keeping the kids,

29:57.379 --> 29:59.681
he's holding them
someplace else.

30:13.028 --> 30:14.678
You need to get away.

30:15.680 --> 30:17.732
I know you.

30:17.816 --> 30:19.617
You're the kid on the news
that was kidnapped.

30:19.684 --> 30:21.486
Who hurt you?

30:21.537 --> 30:25.073
Who is he?
What does he want?

30:26.709 --> 30:29.160
I know this is a lot
to absorb right now.

30:29.211 --> 30:30.328
Where's my mom?

30:30.379 --> 30:31.629
I'm helping you.

30:31.697 --> 30:32.997
You called for help.

30:33.048 --> 30:35.967
The police already came.
They took him away.

30:36.034 --> 30:41.222
Shannon, the problem
isn't the boyfriend.

30:41.306 --> 30:43.741
There'll be another
boyfriend after him

30:43.809 --> 30:46.511
and another after that.

30:46.562 --> 30:48.730
The problem is your mother.

30:52.234 --> 30:53.351
What have you got, Garcia?

30:53.402 --> 30:54.819
Sir, you said to check
backgrounds.

30:54.886 --> 30:56.490
At 10 years of age,
George Kelling entered

30:56.515 --> 30:58.888
the foster care system
and I don't know why.

30:59.191 --> 31:00.608
His father abandoned
the family when he was a baby.

31:00.692 --> 31:02.910
I can't figure out
what happened to mom yet.

31:02.995 --> 31:04.112
All right,
we need the address

31:04.196 --> 31:05.613
of the foster family
he was placed with.

31:05.697 --> 31:06.948
Yeah, yeah, I know.
He bounced around a lot.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.566
Give me a second.
I'll call you back.

31:08.617 --> 31:09.567
Ok.

31:09.618 --> 31:11.235
Ok, what I don't understand

31:11.286 --> 31:14.172
is why would he keep Bobby
but release Timothy?

31:14.239 --> 31:16.457
If he wants to get rid of the
parent, why not kill them first

31:16.542 --> 31:18.626
and then take the child.
It's so much riskier to wait.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.744
Unless the children are a crucial
part of his killing ritual.

31:20.796 --> 31:22.180
How?

31:22.247 --> 31:24.799
He needs something from them
before he can murder the parents.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.517
What could they possibly
give him?

31:26.585 --> 31:28.469
Their approval.

31:28.554 --> 31:30.388
That's what
he wants her to say.

31:30.439 --> 31:33.891
My daughter will never
tell him to get rid of me.

31:33.942 --> 31:36.144
Never.

31:36.228 --> 31:39.230
We fight sometimes,
but we love each other.

31:39.281 --> 31:42.200
She's my whole world.
She means so much to me.

31:42.267 --> 31:44.485
He'll hurt her
if she doesn't,

31:44.570 --> 31:47.622
because that means
she's weak, too.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.493
Deja vu all over again.

31:53.796 --> 31:54.945
So, get this.

31:54.997 --> 31:56.581
George Kelling's mom
committed suicide

31:56.632 --> 31:58.616
when he was 10.
She jumped off a bridge.

31:58.667 --> 32:01.452
Before that, the attempted
to kill herself multiple times,

32:01.503 --> 32:03.888
cutting her wrists.
This sounds really familiar, huh?

32:03.956 --> 32:05.623
Did you find
the foster home address?

32:05.674 --> 32:06.584
Those records are still sealed.

32:06.609 --> 32:08.067
I got my crowbar out,
I'm working on it.

32:09.895 --> 32:11.979
You're crazy.

32:12.064 --> 32:14.465
I'm going to
tell you something

32:14.516 --> 32:18.152
I've never told anyone
before, Shannon.

32:18.237 --> 32:19.987
Nobody.

32:21.824 --> 32:23.941
My mother,

32:23.992 --> 32:25.643
she was troubled, too.

32:28.297 --> 32:30.248
She either
stayed in bed crying

32:30.315 --> 32:32.983
or she went on long walks.

32:33.035 --> 32:37.321
I never knew where
she went on those walks.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.541
Then one day I decided
to follow her.

32:40.626 --> 32:43.261
She didn't know
I was there.

32:43.328 --> 32:47.998
At first it just...
seemed like she was wandering.

32:51.019 --> 32:55.056
But then I saw
where she was going.

32:55.140 --> 32:57.841
It was a bridge.

33:00.679 --> 33:03.614
She climbed up
onto the ledge

33:03.682 --> 33:06.484
and sat there
looking down.

33:08.737 --> 33:12.356
It seemed like she was
there for hours.

33:15.860 --> 33:20.498
My mother,
she wanted to die.

33:23.085 --> 33:24.635
But it was like--

33:24.703 --> 33:27.722
it was like she couldn't
make herself do it.

33:30.809 --> 33:32.810
And then it happened.

33:34.763 --> 33:37.398
She was gone.

33:39.685 --> 33:41.885
For that moment,

33:41.937 --> 33:45.222
I don't think I ever
saw her more content.

33:45.274 --> 33:48.743
It was like
a kind of peacefulness.

33:57.169 --> 33:58.920
Finally,

33:59.004 --> 34:01.005
she was free.

34:03.508 --> 34:06.243
As bad as it seemed,

34:06.295 --> 34:09.429
my mother was right
to kill herself.

34:11.600 --> 34:15.252
From one moment
to the next...

34:15.304 --> 34:17.688
her pain ended...

34:17.755 --> 34:21.592
and my life changed.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.226
Now...

34:25.614 --> 34:27.782
now it's your moment,
Shannon.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.105
The foster family
lived on a farm

34:35.157 --> 34:37.440
10 miles northwest of
the city on Parkhill Road.

34:37.492 --> 34:40.444
The rest of the team
is gonna meet us there.

34:43.748 --> 34:45.716
Hurry.

34:45.784 --> 34:47.385
No, no.
I didn't mean it!

34:47.452 --> 34:48.886
Don't hurt him.
Don't hurt him!

34:48.953 --> 34:50.254
Let go of me!

34:50.304 --> 34:51.672
Stop!
It was me!

34:51.757 --> 34:53.341
Let me out!

34:53.425 --> 34:55.125
Why are you doing this?
What did we do?

34:55.177 --> 34:56.427
Shut up!

34:56.478 --> 34:57.678
Just shut up!

34:57.763 --> 34:59.530
So what happened
to the foster parents?

34:59.585 --> 35:00.588
The father died years ago.

35:00.589 --> 35:02.149
The mother just died
last month--heart attack.

35:02.150 --> 35:04.101
That must have been
the trigger.

35:04.152 --> 35:05.321
The last person who rescued
the unsub was gone.

35:05.346 --> 35:06.546
He assumed the mantle.

35:06.638 --> 35:09.106
And now he suddenly has a
house to take these kids to.

35:09.157 --> 35:12.142
Wait. Garcia said the mother
jumped off of a bridge, right?

35:12.194 --> 35:13.411
Yeah. Why?
What are you thinking?

35:13.478 --> 35:14.978
Suicidology
is an imperfect science,

35:15.030 --> 35:18.148
but it's uncommon for women
to kill themselves so violently.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.921
For lack of a better word,
they tend to choose

35:19.946 --> 35:21.146
more feminine ways to die.

35:21.169 --> 35:22.701
Men shoot themselves,

35:22.726 --> 35:24.329
jump off of buildings
onto pavement.

35:24.539 --> 35:26.340
Women are less messy.

35:26.425 --> 35:28.843
They take pills
and drown themselves.

35:35.500 --> 35:37.968
And now it's your turn
to do the right thing.

35:41.857 --> 35:43.891
I know you will.

35:50.772 --> 35:53.090
This is about making
a decision, Shannon.

35:53.783 --> 35:56.168
Your mother has caused
nothing but pain.

35:56.235 --> 35:59.905
One word from you now
and this will all end.

36:03.593 --> 36:05.911
I love my mom.

36:14.086 --> 36:15.554
That's crap.

36:15.605 --> 36:16.555
What?

36:16.606 --> 36:17.890
If you loved me,

36:17.941 --> 36:19.925
you never would have
called 911.

36:19.976 --> 36:21.927
We're here now
because of you.

36:21.978 --> 36:25.931
Because you were jealous.
Jealous that I had a man in my life.

36:25.982 --> 36:27.532
He was gonna rape me.

36:27.600 --> 36:28.533
According to you.

36:28.601 --> 36:29.985
He came into my room,

36:30.069 --> 36:31.102
he grabbed my blouse

36:31.154 --> 36:33.271
and pushed me onto the bed.

36:36.075 --> 36:38.493
Well, you shouldn't have
been dressing like that

36:38.578 --> 36:39.878
in the first place.

36:39.946 --> 36:41.246
It was like
you were telling him

36:41.297 --> 36:42.664
that you wanted him
to do something.

36:42.749 --> 36:45.217
Why are you saying
these things?

36:45.284 --> 36:47.836
You want to know
the truth?

36:53.843 --> 36:56.979
I told Gary
he could have you.

37:03.519 --> 37:06.071
He was gonna leave me.

37:06.138 --> 37:07.322
You didn't tell him that.

37:07.407 --> 37:08.991
You couldn't.

37:13.646 --> 37:16.081
Reid and JJ and I
will take the front.

37:16.148 --> 37:17.699
The rest of you
take the perimeter.

37:29.161 --> 37:32.097
It's time to end this,
Shannon.

37:32.164 --> 37:34.549
Do you agree?

37:37.387 --> 37:40.439
I think she's made
her decision.

37:40.506 --> 37:43.174
FBI. Put the gun down.

37:43.226 --> 37:45.110
Drop the gun.
Do it.

37:45.177 --> 37:46.728
You have to let me finish.

37:46.813 --> 37:48.563
Nobody else can do it.
Nobody's strong enough.

37:48.648 --> 37:50.065
Like you were strong
with your mother?

37:50.149 --> 37:51.984
Don't talk about her.

37:52.035 --> 37:56.288
She was weak. She killed herself
and left me alone.

37:56.355 --> 37:57.906
I don't think so.

38:05.197 --> 38:07.466
Because she tried
to kill herself before,

38:07.533 --> 38:09.301
nobody would question it.

38:09.368 --> 38:11.003
But you did it. You pushed her
off the bridge.

38:11.054 --> 38:12.504
You killed her.

38:25.568 --> 38:28.386
No. I helped her!

38:28.438 --> 38:29.388
Aah!

38:29.455 --> 38:30.822
The boy's in the closet!

38:30.890 --> 38:32.607
We need medical.
He's down in a back bedroom.

38:32.692 --> 38:34.242
Let me go!
They need me!

38:36.729 --> 38:38.663
Oh, baby, I'm so sorry.

38:38.731 --> 38:41.333
I didn't mean to say those things.
He was gonna kill you.

38:41.400 --> 38:43.902
I know. I know, Mom.

38:48.991 --> 38:50.926
"All things
truly wicked

38:51.010 --> 38:52.761
start from an innocence."

38:52.845 --> 38:54.379
Ernest Hemingway.

38:54.430 --> 38:56.715
We got all the kids
back safe.

38:56.766 --> 38:59.434
Think about it, Aaron.
How often does that happen?

38:59.519 --> 39:00.719
Not often enough.

39:00.770 --> 39:02.220
How about 10 pairs of shoes?

39:02.271 --> 39:03.755
I mean, that has to be
enough, right? 10?

39:03.806 --> 39:06.091
Ah, Spence, it's different
with the ladies.

39:06.142 --> 39:09.945
We need them to match our belts,
our handbags, our skirts,

39:10.029 --> 39:11.947
and the fashions change
with the seasons.

39:12.031 --> 39:14.265
Yes. Boys are so boring.

39:14.317 --> 39:15.784
Pants, shoes,
out the door.

39:15.868 --> 39:18.286
Although it's not like
men don't have their things.

39:18.371 --> 39:19.955
I dated a golfer once.

39:20.039 --> 39:22.074
He had 12 putters
in his closet.

39:22.125 --> 39:24.876
But this conversation
is reminding me I need new boots.

39:24.944 --> 39:28.046
They're having a sale at DeMille's
on those tall-shaft kitty heels.

39:28.114 --> 39:29.464
- You like those. Do you want to go?- Yeah.

39:29.549 --> 39:30.966
You getting
all this, kid?

39:31.050 --> 39:32.334
No.

39:44.480 --> 39:46.348
Sure you don't
need any help?

39:46.432 --> 39:48.233
Done. Sit down, relax.

39:48.300 --> 39:49.818
Hmm.

39:49.902 --> 39:51.136
The cioppino

39:51.187 --> 39:52.654
was delicious.

39:52.738 --> 39:54.322
You gotta love any dish

39:54.407 --> 39:56.808
that recommends
the wearing of a bib.

39:56.859 --> 39:58.143
Yeah.

39:58.194 --> 40:00.195
Top me off, would you?

40:00.279 --> 40:03.982
You know, I don't remember you
as being a big wine drinker.

40:04.033 --> 40:07.002
Well, I'm not.

40:07.086 --> 40:08.837
I guess I just

40:08.921 --> 40:11.656
need a little
fortification tonight.

40:11.707 --> 40:15.127
When did you ever
need that with me?

40:15.178 --> 40:16.995
You know,
who would have thought

40:17.046 --> 40:19.998
that we'd find ourselves
on a date again

40:20.049 --> 40:21.600
after all these years?

40:25.771 --> 40:27.355
David...

40:29.442 --> 40:32.861
Do you remember
during our divorce

40:32.945 --> 40:36.882
the pledge we made
to one another?

40:36.949 --> 40:40.097
That no matter what,
we'd always be there

40:40.122 --> 40:41.286
for the other one.

40:41.287 --> 40:44.573
Future spouses
and significant others

40:44.657 --> 40:47.159
would just have to understand.

40:47.210 --> 40:48.994
We joked
we were the only couple

40:49.045 --> 40:52.697
that had both marriage
and divorce vows.

40:54.533 --> 40:57.219
Hey, what's going on
with you?

40:59.589 --> 41:02.007
Um...

41:02.058 --> 41:05.177
You know, I...

41:05.228 --> 41:07.012
I don't know
how to say this,

41:07.063 --> 41:11.700
except--except
to just say it.

41:13.236 --> 41:18.406
Last year I was diagnosed
with ALS, Lou Gehrig's disease.

41:18.491 --> 41:19.524
Carolyn--

41:19.575 --> 41:21.059
Look, like you always said,

41:21.110 --> 41:22.944
nobody lives forever.

41:23.029 --> 41:24.946
Why didn't you call me earlier?
I could have--

41:25.031 --> 41:27.365
Please--
please let me finish.

41:27.416 --> 41:30.035
Because if I don't
get this out now,

41:30.086 --> 41:33.038
I don't know
that I ever will.

41:34.573 --> 41:38.877
I've had this disease
for over a year.

41:38.928 --> 41:41.630
To live 18 months
is a gift.

41:41.714 --> 41:46.017
The last few weeks I've started
noticing the signs.

41:47.553 --> 41:49.771
It won't be long now.

41:52.058 --> 41:55.060
I came to ask you...

41:55.111 --> 41:59.314
When the disease
reaches the point

41:59.398 --> 42:06.821
and I'm too weak
or too afraid...

42:06.906 --> 42:09.774
I--I want you to help me

42:09.825 --> 42:13.495
leave this world
on my own terms.

42:15.248 --> 42:19.467
When it's time, will you
help me end my life?
