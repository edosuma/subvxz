01:35.209 --> 01:38.713
I am Gunnery Sergeant Hartman,
your senior drill instructor.

01:38.879 --> 01:41.950
From now on,
you will speak only when spoken to...

01:42.116 --> 01:45.722
...and the first and last words
out of your filthy sewers will be "sir."

01:45.886 --> 01:47.763
Do you maggots understand that?

01:47.922 --> 01:49.162
Sir, yes, sir.

01:49.323 --> 01:52.633
Bullshit. I can't hear you.
Sound off like you got a pair.

01:52.793 --> 01:54.169
Sir, yes, sir.

01:54.328 --> 01:58.708
If you ladies leave my island,
if you survive recruit training...

01:58.866 --> 02:00.208
...you will be a weapon.

02:00.367 --> 02:03.404
You will be a minister of death
praying for war.

02:03.571 --> 02:06.381
But until that day, you are pukes.

02:06.540 --> 02:08.917
You are the lowest form of life on Earth.

02:09.076 --> 02:11.453
You are not even human-fucking-beings.

02:11.612 --> 02:16.527
You are nothing but unorganized,
grabasstic pieces of amphibian shit.

02:16.717 --> 02:19.561
Because I am hard, you will not like me.

02:19.720 --> 02:22.427
But the more you hate me,
the more you will learn.

02:22.590 --> 02:24.694
I am hard but I am fair.

02:24.859 --> 02:27.134
There is no racial bigotry here.

02:27.294 --> 02:31.435
I do not look down on niggers,
kikes, wops or greasers.

02:31.599 --> 02:34.079
Here, you are all equally worthless.

02:34.235 --> 02:37.238
And my orders are to weed out
all non-hackers...

02:37.404 --> 02:40.248
...who do not pack the gear
to serve in my beloved Corps.

02:40.407 --> 02:42.409
Do you maggots understand that?

02:42.576 --> 02:43.816
Sir, yes, sir.

02:43.978 --> 02:45.718
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

02:45.880 --> 02:47.882
Sir, yes, sir!

02:48.048 --> 02:51.324
- What's your name, scumbag?
- Sir, Private Brown, sir!

02:51.652 --> 02:54.064
Bullshit. From now on
you're Private Snowball.

02:54.221 --> 02:56.564
- Do you like that name?
- Sir, yes, sir!

02:56.724 --> 02:59.431
Well, there's one thing
that you won't like, Snowball:

02:59.593 --> 03:01.766
They don't serve fried chicken
and watermelon...

03:01.929 --> 03:04.033
...on a daily basis in my mess hall.

03:04.198 --> 03:05.677
Sir, yes, sir!

03:05.833 --> 03:09.439
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

03:09.603 --> 03:11.309
Who said that?

03:11.472 --> 03:13.451
Who the fuck said that?

03:13.607 --> 03:17.077
Who's the slimy little communist-shit,
twinkle-toed cocksucker down here...

03:17.244 --> 03:19.883
...who just signed
his own death warrant?

03:20.214 --> 03:22.250
Nobody, huh?

03:22.416 --> 03:26.125
The fairy-fucking-godmother said it.
Out-fucking-standing.

03:26.287 --> 03:28.892
I will P.T. You all until you fucking die.

03:29.056 --> 03:31.832
I'll P.T. You until your assholes
are sucking buttermilk.

03:31.992 --> 03:34.870
- Was it you, you scroungy little fuck?
- Sir, no, sir.

03:35.029 --> 03:38.237
You piece of shit. You look
like a fucking worm. I'll bet it was you.

03:38.399 --> 03:41.778
- Sir, no, sir.
- Sir, I said it, sir.

03:43.203 --> 03:45.649
Well, no shit.

03:45.806 --> 03:49.151
What have we got here?
A fucking comedian. Private Joker.

03:49.310 --> 03:51.221
I admire your honesty.

03:51.378 --> 03:54.848
Hell, I like you. You can come over
to my house and fuck my sister.

03:56.483 --> 04:00.726
You little scumbag.
I've got your name. I've got your ass.

04:00.888 --> 04:02.924
You will not laugh. You will not cry.

04:03.090 --> 04:05.331
You will learn by the numbers.
I will teach you.

04:05.759 --> 04:08.068
Now get up. Get on your feet.

04:08.228 --> 04:12.972
You best unfuck yourself or I will unscrew
your head and shit down your neck.

04:13.133 --> 04:16.512
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Private Joker, why did you join my Corps?

04:16.670 --> 04:18.740
- Sir, to kill, sir.
- So you're a killer?

04:18.906 --> 04:21.784
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Let me see your war face.

04:21.942 --> 04:24.354
- Sir?
- You've got a war face?

04:25.612 --> 04:29.355
That's a war face.
Now let me see your war face.

04:29.516 --> 04:34.055
Bullshit. You didn't convince me.
Let me see your real war face.

04:34.855 --> 04:36.834
You don't scare me. Work on it.

04:36.991 --> 04:38.595
Sir, yes, sir!

04:38.759 --> 04:40.033
What's your excuse?

04:40.194 --> 04:41.570
Sir, excuse for what, sir?

04:41.729 --> 04:44.573
I'm asking the fucking questions, private.
Do you understand?

04:44.732 --> 04:46.768
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Well, thank you very much.

04:46.934 --> 04:49.505
- Can I be in charge for a while?
- Sir, yes, sir.

04:49.670 --> 04:52.810
- Are you shook-up? Are you nervous?
- Sir, I am, sir.

04:52.973 --> 04:55.043
- Do I make you nervous?
- Sir...

04:55.209 --> 04:57.916
Sir what?
Were you about to call me an asshole?

04:58.078 --> 05:00.421
- Sir, no, sir.
- How tall are you, private?

05:00.581 --> 05:02.060
Sir, 5'9", sir.

05:02.216 --> 05:05.026
Five-foot-9. I didn't know
they stacked shit that high.

05:05.185 --> 05:07.494
You trying to squeeze an inch
in on me somewhere?

05:07.654 --> 05:08.951
Sir, no, sir.

05:08.986 --> 05:10.657
Bullshit. It looks like
the best part of you...

05:10.824 --> 05:14.567
...ran down the crack of your mama's ass
and ended up as a stain on the mattress.

05:14.762 --> 05:16.070
I think you've been cheated.

05:16.530 --> 05:18.339
Where the hell are you from, private?

05:18.499 --> 05:21.002
- Sir, Texas, sir.
- Holy dogshit. Texas?

05:21.168 --> 05:24.239
Only steers and queers
come from Texas, Private Cowboy.

05:24.405 --> 05:27.909
And you don't much look like a steer to me,
so that kind of narrows it down.

05:28.075 --> 05:30.077
- Do you suck dicks?
- Sir, no, sir.

05:30.244 --> 05:32.553
- Are you a peter puffer?
- Sir, no, sir.

05:32.713 --> 05:35.159
I'll bet you would fuck
a person in the ass...

05:35.315 --> 05:38.955
...and not even have the goddamn common
courtesy to give him a reach around.

05:39.119 --> 05:41.223
I'll be watching you.

05:42.890 --> 05:44.994
Did your parents have any children
that lived?

05:45.159 --> 05:47.400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I'll bet they regret that.

05:47.561 --> 05:50.507
You're so ugly you could be
a modern-art masterpiece.

05:50.664 --> 05:53.269
- What's your name, fat-body?
- Sir, Leonard Lawrence, sir.

05:53.434 --> 05:55.140
Lawrence? Lawrence what, of Arabia?

05:55.302 --> 05:58.942
- Sir, no, sir.
- That name sounds like royalty. You royalty?

05:59.106 --> 06:01.085
- Sir, no, sir.
- Do you suck dicks?

06:01.241 --> 06:04.187
- Sir, no, sir.
- Bullshit. I'll bet you could suck a golf ball...

06:04.344 --> 06:06.323
...through a garden hose.
- Sir, no, sir.

06:06.480 --> 06:07.924
I don't like the name Lawrence.

06:08.082 --> 06:10.221
Only faggots and sailors
are called Lawrence.

06:10.384 --> 06:13.023
- From now on you're Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

06:13.187 --> 06:15.860
Do you think I'm cute, Private Pyle?
You think I'm funny?

06:16.023 --> 06:19.129
- Sir, no, sir.
- Wipe that disgusting grin off your face.

06:19.293 --> 06:21.204
Sir, yes, sir.

06:21.361 --> 06:23.500
Well, any-fucking-time, sweetheart.

06:23.964 --> 06:27.377
- Sir, I'm trying, sir.
- Private Pyle, I'll give you three seconds...

06:27.534 --> 06:29.638
...exactly three fucking seconds...

06:29.803 --> 06:32.374
...to wipe that stupid-looking grin
off your face...

06:32.539 --> 06:36.543
...or I will gouge out your eyeballs
and skull-fuck you.

06:36.710 --> 06:39.247
One. Two. Three.

06:39.413 --> 06:44.055
- Sir, I can't help it, sir.
- Bullshit. Get on your knees, scumbag.

06:45.519 --> 06:47.760
Now choke yourself.

06:48.956 --> 06:51.993
Goddamn it, with my hand, numb-nuts.

06:52.626 --> 06:56.198
Don't pull my fucking hand over there.
I said, choke yourself.

06:56.363 --> 06:59.207
Now lean forward and choke yourself.

07:02.136 --> 07:05.207
- Are you through grinning?
- Sir, yes, sir.

07:05.372 --> 07:06.942
Bullshit. I can't hear you.

07:07.975 --> 07:09.317
Sir, yes, sir.

07:09.476 --> 07:13.321
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.
Sound off like you've got a pair.

07:13.480 --> 07:15.289
Sir, yes, sir.

07:15.449 --> 07:18.361
That's enough. Get on your feet.

07:21.321 --> 07:25.928
Pyle, you had best square your ass away
and start shitting me Tiffany cuff links...

07:26.093 --> 07:28.698
...or I will definitely fuck you up.

07:28.862 --> 07:30.841
Sir, yes, sir.

07:31.932 --> 07:35.436
Left, right, left, right
left, right, left.

07:35.602 --> 07:37.945
Left, right, left, right, left.

07:38.105 --> 07:39.743
Left, right, left, right, left...

07:39.907 --> 07:42.546
Parris Island, South Carolina...

07:42.709 --> 07:45.951
...the United States Marine Corps
Recruit Depot.

07:46.113 --> 07:49.753
An eight-week college
for the phony-tough and the crazy-brave.

07:49.917 --> 07:52.761
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

07:52.920 --> 07:55.696
Mama and Papa were laying in bed

07:55.856 --> 07:58.700
Mama rolled over
And this is what she said

07:58.859 --> 08:01.236
Mama rolled over, this is what she said

08:01.395 --> 08:04.341
- Oh, give me some, give me some
- Oh, give me some, give me some

08:04.498 --> 08:05.806
- P.T.
- P.T.

08:05.966 --> 08:07.308
- P.T.
- P.T.

08:07.467 --> 08:08.809
- Good for you
- Good for you

08:08.969 --> 08:10.448
- And good for me
- And good for me

08:10.604 --> 08:11.912
- Good
- Good

08:12.072 --> 08:14.814
Up in the morning to the rising sun

08:14.975 --> 08:17.478
Up in the morning to the rising sun

08:17.644 --> 08:20.420
Gonna run all day till the running's done

08:20.581 --> 08:23.721
Gonna run all day till the running's done

08:23.884 --> 08:26.728
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

08:26.887 --> 08:29.333
Ho Chi Minh is a son of a bitch

08:29.489 --> 08:32.400
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

08:32.558 --> 08:35.630
Got the blue balls, crabs
And the seven-year itch

08:35.796 --> 08:39.333
Left, right, left, right, left.

08:39.499 --> 08:42.445
Your left shoulder.

08:43.337 --> 08:46.477
Left, right, left. Port.

08:48.141 --> 08:51.451
Left, right. Attack. Halt.

08:53.113 --> 08:55.320
Left shoulder.

08:58.385 --> 09:01.161
Private Pyle, what are you trying to do
to my beloved Corps?

09:01.321 --> 09:03.858
- Sir, I don't know, sir.
- You are dumb, Private Pyle...

09:04.024 --> 09:07.300
...but do you expect me to believe
that you don't know left from right?

09:07.461 --> 09:09.838
- Sir, no, sir.
- Then you did that on purpose.

09:09.997 --> 09:12.909
- You wanna be different.
- Sir, no, sir.

09:13.066 --> 09:15.978
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, left side, sir.

09:16.136 --> 09:19.674
- Are you sure, Private Pyle?
- Sir, yes, sir.

09:19.840 --> 09:23.412
- What side was that, Private Pyle?
- Sir, right side, sir.

09:23.577 --> 09:25.954
Don't fuck with me again, Pyle.

09:26.113 --> 09:27.751
Pick up your fucking cover.

09:27.914 --> 09:29.154
Sir, yes, sir.

09:29.316 --> 09:32.160
Your left shoulder.

09:33.120 --> 09:36.396
Left, right, left. Port.

09:37.858 --> 09:40.429
Left shoulder.

09:41.995 --> 09:44.941
Your right shoulder.

09:46.300 --> 09:51.112
Left, right, left, right.
Your left shoulder.

09:52.372 --> 09:55.011
Left, two, three, four.

09:55.175 --> 09:57.712
Your right shoulder.

10:00.480 --> 10:04.484
Tonight you pukes will sleep
with your rifles.

10:04.651 --> 10:08.155
You will give your rifle a girl's name.

10:08.322 --> 10:13.533
Because this is the only pussy
you people are going to get.

10:13.694 --> 10:18.165
Your days of finger-banging
old Mary Jane Rottencrotch...

10:18.332 --> 10:22.507
...through her purty pink panties
are over.

10:22.669 --> 10:24.739
You're married to this piece.

10:24.905 --> 10:27.578
This weapon of iron and wood.

10:27.741 --> 10:30.949
And you will be faithful.

10:31.712 --> 10:33.486
Arms.

10:35.582 --> 10:37.857
Prepare to mount.

10:41.822 --> 10:43.392
Mount.

10:48.695 --> 10:49.764
Port.

10:54.601 --> 10:55.841
Pray.

10:56.536 --> 10:58.572
This is my rifle.

10:58.739 --> 11:02.243
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

11:02.409 --> 11:05.082
My rifle is my best friend.

11:05.245 --> 11:06.917
It is my life.

11:07.080 --> 11:11.392
I must master it
as I must master my life.

11:11.551 --> 11:14.531
Without me, my rifle is useless.

11:14.688 --> 11:17.566
Without my rifle, I am useless.

11:17.824 --> 11:20.600
I must fire my rifle true.

11:20.761 --> 11:24.800
I must shoot straighter than my enemy,
who is trying to kill me.

11:24.965 --> 11:27.945
I must shoot him before he shoots me.

11:28.101 --> 11:29.636
I will.

11:29.803 --> 11:32.476
Before God, I swear this creed.

11:32.639 --> 11:36.348
My rifle and myself are defenders
of my country.

11:36.510 --> 11:38.785
We are the masters of our enemy.

11:38.945 --> 11:41.425
We are the saviors of my life.

11:41.581 --> 11:45.824
So be it until there is no enemy,
but peace.

11:45.986 --> 11:47.692
Amen.

11:47.854 --> 11:50.027
Arm.

11:53.827 --> 11:55.499
At ease.

11:56.396 --> 11:57.875
Good night, ladies.

11:58.031 --> 12:00.704
Good night, sir.

12:01.101 --> 12:03.672
- Hit it, sweetheart.
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.

12:04.137 --> 12:07.015
Right shoulder.

12:10.977 --> 12:14.788
That is not
your daddy's shotgun, Cowboy.

12:16.383 --> 12:19.159
Left shoulder.

12:21.388 --> 12:26.837
Move the rifle around your head,
not your head around the rifle.

12:28.728 --> 12:30.502
Port.

12:32.766 --> 12:37.339
Four inches from your chest, Pyle.
Four inches.

12:37.904 --> 12:40.475
This is my rifle, this is my gun

12:40.640 --> 12:43.143
This is for fighting, this is for fun

12:43.310 --> 12:45.756
This is my rifle, this is my gun

12:45.912 --> 12:48.324
This is for fighting, this is for fun

12:48.482 --> 12:50.985
This is my rifle, this is my gun

12:51.151 --> 12:53.597
This is for fighting, this is for fun

12:53.753 --> 12:56.199
This is my rifle, this is my gun

12:56.356 --> 12:58.802
This is for fighting, this is for fun

12:58.959 --> 13:01.336
This is my rifle, this is my gun

13:01.495 --> 13:04.271
This is for fighting, this is for fun

13:09.436 --> 13:11.176
You're bouncing.

13:26.953 --> 13:28.227
Ten fucking seconds.

13:28.388 --> 13:33.269
It should take you no less than 10
fucking seconds to negotiate this obstacle.

13:33.426 --> 13:34.927
Quickly, move it out.

13:35.128 --> 13:38.734
There ain't one swinging-dick private
in this platoon's gonna graduate...

13:38.899 --> 13:43.177
...until they can get this obstacle down
to less than 10 fucking seconds.

14:06.660 --> 14:08.662
Next two privates. Quickly.

14:08.828 --> 14:11.604
Get over that goddamn obstacle. Move it.

14:11.765 --> 14:13.835
Next two privates. Quickly.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.376
Hurry up. Get up there.

14:15.535 --> 14:18.242
- Private Joker, are you a killer?
- Sir, yes, sir.

14:18.405 --> 14:20.282
Let me hear your war cry.

14:21.441 --> 14:24.183
Next two privates, go. Quickly.

14:24.344 --> 14:26.483
Get your fat ass over there, Private Pyle.

14:26.646 --> 14:28.386
Oh, that's right, Private Pyle.

14:28.548 --> 14:32.461
Don't make any fucking effort
to get up to the top of the fucking obstacle.

14:32.619 --> 14:37.124
If God wanted you up there, he would have
miracled your ass up by now, wouldn't he?

14:37.290 --> 14:40.032
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Get your fat ass up there, Pyle.

14:40.193 --> 14:42.400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- What is the matter with you?

14:42.562 --> 14:46.771
I'll bet if there was some pussy up there on
top of that obstacle, you could get up there.

14:46.933 --> 14:48.639
- Couldn't you?
- Sir, yes, sir.

14:48.802 --> 14:53.011
Your ass looks like about 150 pounds
of chewed bubble gum. Do you know that?

14:53.173 --> 14:54.617
Sir, yes, sir.

14:57.010 --> 14:59.353
One for the commandant.

15:00.447 --> 15:02.551
One for the Corps.

15:03.249 --> 15:06.491
Get up there. Pull.

15:07.087 --> 15:10.363
I guess the Corps don't get theirs.
Get up there, Pyle.

15:10.523 --> 15:13.560
Pull. Pull, Pyle, pull.

15:13.727 --> 15:16.264
One pull-up, Pyle. Come on, pull.

15:16.429 --> 15:20.035
You gotta be shitting me, Pyle.
Get your ass up there.

15:20.200 --> 15:23.875
Do you mean to tell me that you cannot
do one single pull-up?

15:24.037 --> 15:28.417
You are a worthless piece of shit, Pyle.
Get out of my face.

15:28.575 --> 15:30.577
Get up there, Snowball.

15:31.678 --> 15:33.384
Get up here, fat-boy.

15:33.546 --> 15:36.822
Quickly. Move it up.
Move it up, Pyle. Move it up.

15:36.983 --> 15:41.192
You climb obstacles like old people fuck.
Do you know that, Private Pyle?

15:41.354 --> 15:44.664
Get up here. You're too slow.
Move it. Move it.

15:44.824 --> 15:48.362
Private Pyle, whatever you do,
don't fall down.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.735
That would break my fucking heart.

15:50.897 --> 15:54.367
Quickly. Up and over. Up and over.

15:54.534 --> 15:58.072
Well, what in the fuck are you waiting for,
Private Pyle?

15:58.238 --> 16:01.981
Get up and over.
Move it, move it, move it.

16:02.142 --> 16:04.679
Are you quitting on me?

16:04.844 --> 16:06.880
Well, are you?

16:07.047 --> 16:11.359
Then quit, you slimy fucking
walrus-looking piece of shit.

16:11.518 --> 16:14.021
Get the fuck off of my obstacle.

16:14.187 --> 16:16.929
Get the fuck down off of my obstacle.

16:17.090 --> 16:19.297
Now. Move it.

16:19.459 --> 16:24.840
I'm gonna rip your balls off so you
cannot contaminate the rest of the world.

16:24.998 --> 16:27.637
I will motivate you, Private Pyle...

16:27.801 --> 16:32.408
...if it short-dicks every cannibal
on the Congo.

16:33.406 --> 16:36.011
Pick them up and set them down, Pyle.

16:36.176 --> 16:38.246
Quickly. Move it out.

16:38.411 --> 16:43.018
Were you born a fat, slimy,
scumbag puke piece of shit, Private Pyle?

16:43.183 --> 16:45.526
Or did you have to work on it?

16:45.685 --> 16:49.291
Move it up. Quickly. Hustle up.

16:49.456 --> 16:54.029
The fucking war will be over by the time
we get out there, won't it, Private Pyle?

16:54.194 --> 16:55.764
Move it.

16:55.929 --> 17:00.104
Are you going to fucking die, Pyle?
Are you going to die on me?

17:00.266 --> 17:02.302
Do it now.

17:02.469 --> 17:05.939
Move it up. Hustle it up.
Quickly, quickly, quickly.

17:07.006 --> 17:09.577
Do you feel dizzy?

17:09.742 --> 17:12.086
Do you feel faint?

17:12.811 --> 17:17.784
Jesus H. Christ,
I think you've got a hard-on.

17:19.452 --> 17:23.422
Quickly, ladies. Assholes and elbows.
Move it out.

17:23.589 --> 17:25.125
Get up here.

17:25.290 --> 17:28.966
Move it. Move it, move it, move it.

17:29.562 --> 17:31.097
Quickly.

17:31.264 --> 17:35.075
Quickly. Get up here.
Hurry up. Move it out.

17:48.948 --> 17:51.325
Reveille. Reveille. Reveille.

17:51.484 --> 17:53.361
Drop your cocks and grab your socks.

17:53.520 --> 17:56.432
Today is Sunday.
Divine worship at 0800.

17:56.589 --> 17:59.001
Get your bunks made
and get your uniforms on.

17:59.159 --> 18:02.105
Police call will commence
in two minutes.

18:02.262 --> 18:03.672
Private Cowboy, Private Joker.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.400
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

18:05.565 --> 18:09.137
As soon as you finish your bunks,
I want you two turds to clean the head.

18:09.302 --> 18:12.373
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- I want that head so sanitary...

18:12.539 --> 18:16.612
...that the Virgin Mary herself would be
proud to go in there and take a dump.

18:16.776 --> 18:18.152
- Sir, yes, sir.
- Sir, yes, sir.

18:18.311 --> 18:20.552
Private Joker, do you believe
in the Virgin Mary?

18:20.713 --> 18:22.522
Sir, no, sir.

18:25.718 --> 18:29.393
Well, Private Joker,
I don't believe I heard you correctly.

18:29.556 --> 18:31.763
Sir, the private said, "No, sir," sir.

18:31.925 --> 18:35.099
Why, you little maggot.
You make me wanna vomit.

18:35.261 --> 18:39.436
You goddamn communist heathen.
Sound off that you love the Virgin Mary...

18:39.599 --> 18:41.806
...or I'm gonna stomp your guts out.

18:41.968 --> 18:44.311
Now, you do love the Virgin Mary,
don't you?

18:44.470 --> 18:45.744
Sir, negative, sir.

18:45.905 --> 18:48.408
Private Joker,
are you trying to offend me?

18:48.575 --> 18:49.917
Sir, negative, sir.

18:50.076 --> 18:53.147
Sir, the private believes that
any answer he gives will be wrong...

18:53.313 --> 18:57.226
...and the senior drill instructor will
beat him harder if he reverses himself, sir.

18:57.383 --> 18:58.953
Who's your squad leader, scumbag?

18:59.118 --> 19:01.962
Sir, the private's squad leader
is Private Snowball, sir.

19:02.121 --> 19:04.032
Private Snowball.

19:04.190 --> 19:06.829
Sir, Private Snowball
reporting as ordered, sir.

19:06.993 --> 19:10.702
Private Snowball, you're fired.
Private Joker is promoted to squad leader.

19:10.864 --> 19:13.310
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Disappear, scumbag.

19:13.466 --> 19:16.208
- Sir, aye, aye, sir.
- Private Pyle.

19:16.369 --> 19:19.315
- Sir, Private Pyle reporting as ordered, sir.
- From now on...

19:19.472 --> 19:22.782
...Private Joker is your new squad leader
and you will bunk with him.

19:22.942 --> 19:24.250
He'll teach you everything.

19:24.410 --> 19:26.617
- He'll teach you how to pee.
- Sir, yes, sir.

19:26.779 --> 19:30.886
Private Joker is silly and he's ignorant,
but he's got guts and guts is enough.

19:31.050 --> 19:32.790
Now, you ladies, carry on.

19:32.952 --> 19:35.159
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

19:41.628 --> 19:45.132
The bolt. The bolt goes in the receiver.

19:48.635 --> 19:50.876
Operating-rod handle.

19:51.037 --> 19:53.517
Operating-rod guide.

19:53.940 --> 19:57.182
And the left one over the right.

19:57.343 --> 19:59.447
Right one over the left.

20:01.814 --> 20:04.123
Left one over the right.

20:04.284 --> 20:06.559
The right one over the left.

20:10.089 --> 20:12.364
Just throw your other leg over.

20:17.230 --> 20:18.868
Attaboy.

20:20.033 --> 20:24.948
That's it. Now just pull the next one over
and you're home free.

20:25.872 --> 20:27.442
Ready?

20:32.512 --> 20:34.457
Just throw it over.

20:41.854 --> 20:43.094
Attaboy.

20:43.389 --> 20:45.232
Set it down.

20:48.061 --> 20:49.562
All right?

20:50.697 --> 20:52.608
There you go.

20:54.200 --> 20:56.407
Congratulations, Leonard.

20:56.569 --> 20:58.173
You did it.

20:59.005 --> 21:01.985
Fold the blanket
and the sheet back together.

21:02.141 --> 21:04.484
Make a four-inch fold.

21:05.178 --> 21:07.351
Okay? Got it?

21:07.513 --> 21:09.424
You do it.

21:11.250 --> 21:13.286
Right shoulder.

21:13.453 --> 21:15.557
Your left shoulder.

21:19.025 --> 21:20.731
Port.

21:25.231 --> 21:27.040
Order.

21:49.589 --> 21:52.569
Your right shoulder.

21:56.963 --> 21:58.567
Square these weapons away.

21:58.731 --> 22:01.609
My Corps' arms should be
parallel to the...

22:04.370 --> 22:07.043
The deadliest weapon in the world...

22:07.206 --> 22:11.085
...is a Marine and his rifle.

22:11.244 --> 22:14.748
It is your killer instinct
which must be harnessed...

22:14.914 --> 22:18.987
...if you expect to survive in combat.

22:19.152 --> 22:22.690
Your rifle is only a tool.

22:22.855 --> 22:25.426
It is a hard heart that kills.

22:26.225 --> 22:31.071
If your killer instincts
are not clean and strong...

22:31.230 --> 22:34.267
...you will hesitate
at the moment of truth.

22:34.434 --> 22:36.436
You will not kill.

22:36.602 --> 22:38.979
You will become dead-Marine.

22:39.138 --> 22:42.483
And then you will be in a world of shit.

22:42.642 --> 22:44.382
Because Marines...

22:44.544 --> 22:48.150
...are not allowed to die
without permission.

22:48.314 --> 22:49.986
Do you maggots understand?

22:50.149 --> 22:51.684
Sir, yes, sir.

22:53.252 --> 22:56.062
I love working for Uncle Sam

22:56.222 --> 22:58.998
I love working for Uncle Sam

22:59.158 --> 23:01.934
Lets me know just who I am

23:02.095 --> 23:04.905
Lets me know just who I am

23:05.064 --> 23:07.908
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

23:08.067 --> 23:10.911
One, two, three, four
United States Marine Corps

23:11.070 --> 23:13.914
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

23:14.073 --> 23:16.917
One, two, three, four
I love the Marine Corps

23:17.076 --> 23:18.418
- My Corps
- My Corps

23:18.578 --> 23:19.920
- Your Corps
- Your Corps

23:20.079 --> 23:21.387

- Our Corps

23:21.547 --> 23:22.991
- Marine Corps
- Marine Corps

23:23.149 --> 23:25.993
I don't know, but I've been told

23:26.152 --> 23:29.030
I don't know, but I've been told

23:29.188 --> 23:31.964
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

23:32.125 --> 23:34.935
Eskimo pussy is mighty cold

23:35.094 --> 23:36.436
- Good
- Good

23:36.596 --> 23:37.972
- Feels good
- Feels good

23:38.131 --> 23:39.439
- Is good
- Is good

23:39.599 --> 23:40.941
- Real good
- Real good

23:41.100 --> 23:42.442
- Tastes good
- Tastes good

23:42.602 --> 23:43.978
- Mighty good

23:44.137 --> 23:45.479
- Good for you
- Good for you

23:45.638 --> 23:47.048
- Good for me
- Good for me

23:49.642 --> 23:51.143
Trim them.

23:54.113 --> 23:55.887
Toe jam.

23:58.751 --> 24:00.628
Pop that blister.

24:09.295 --> 24:12.207
Jesus H. Christ.

24:13.132 --> 24:16.374
Private Pyle,
why is your footlocker unlocked?

24:16.536 --> 24:17.707
Sir, I don't know, sir.

24:17.870 --> 24:21.340
Private Pyle, if there is one thing
in this world that I hate...

24:21.507 --> 24:24.817
...it is an unlocked footlocker.
You know that, don't you?

24:24.977 --> 24:27.548
- Sir, yes, sir.
- If it wasn't for dickheads like you...

24:27.713 --> 24:30.284
...there wouldn't be thievery
in the world, would there?

24:30.449 --> 24:32.428
- Sir, no, sir.
- Get down.

24:36.789 --> 24:40.634
Well, now, let's just see
if there's anything missing.

24:43.229 --> 24:45.402
Holy Jesus.

24:45.565 --> 24:47.374
What is that?

24:47.533 --> 24:50.138
What the fuck is that?

24:50.303 --> 24:52.009
What is that, Private Pyle?

24:52.171 --> 24:53.445
Sir, a jelly doughnut, sir.

24:53.606 --> 24:55.983
- A jelly doughnut?
- Sir, yes, sir.

24:56.142 --> 24:59.213
- How did it get here?
- Sir, I took it from the mess hall, sir.

24:59.378 --> 25:01.517
Is chow allowed in the barracks,
Private Pyle?

25:01.681 --> 25:05.424
- Sir, no, sir.
- Are you allowed to eat jelly doughnuts?

25:05.585 --> 25:07.962
- Sir, no, sir.
- And why not, Private Pyle?

25:08.120 --> 25:09.792
Sir, because I'm too heavy, sir.

25:09.956 --> 25:14.996
- Because you are a disgusting fat-body.
- Sir, yes, sir.

25:15.161 --> 25:18.733
Then why did you hide a jelly doughnut
in your footlocker, Private Pyle?

25:18.898 --> 25:20.877
Sir, because I was hungry, sir.

25:21.033 --> 25:24.139
Because you were hungry.

25:27.540 --> 25:31.351
Private Pyle has dishonored himself...

25:31.510 --> 25:34.149
...and dishonored the platoon.

25:34.313 --> 25:38.283
I have tried to help him,
but I have failed.

25:38.451 --> 25:43.366
I have failed
because you have not helped me.

25:43.522 --> 25:47.595
You people have not given Private Pyle...

25:47.760 --> 25:49.967
...the proper motivation.

25:50.663 --> 25:55.635
So from now on,
whenever Private Pyle fucks up...

25:55.801 --> 25:58.076
...I will not punish him.

25:58.237 --> 26:00.717
I will punish all of you.

26:00.873 --> 26:02.977
And the way I see it, ladies...

26:03.142 --> 26:06.213
...you owe me for one jelly doughnut.

26:06.379 --> 26:09.086
Now get on your faces.

26:10.483 --> 26:12.223
Open your mouth.

26:12.385 --> 26:14.888
They're paying for it, you eat it.

26:15.054 --> 26:17.431
Ready, exercise.

26:17.590 --> 26:20.229
One, two, three, four

26:20.393 --> 26:22.896
I love the Marine Corps

26:23.062 --> 26:25.439
One, two, three, four

26:25.598 --> 26:28.010
I love the Marine Corps

26:28.167 --> 26:30.613
One, two, three, four

26:30.770 --> 26:33.113
I love the Marine Corps

26:33.272 --> 26:35.775
One, two, three, four

26:35.941 --> 26:38.284
I love the Marine Corps

26:38.444 --> 26:40.821
One, two, three, four...

26:42.081 --> 26:45.027
You really look like shit today, Leonard.

26:51.357 --> 26:53.097
Joker.

26:55.494 --> 26:58.270
Everybody hates me now.

27:00.800 --> 27:02.677
Even you.

27:05.705 --> 27:08.048
Nobody hates you, Leonard.

27:08.507 --> 27:10.714
You just keep making mistakes.

27:10.876 --> 27:13.185
Getting everybody in trouble.

27:16.082 --> 27:18.653
I can't do anything right.

27:21.153 --> 27:23.098
I need help.

27:26.659 --> 27:28.968
I'm trying to help you, Leonard.

27:30.696 --> 27:32.835
I'm really trying.

27:35.000 --> 27:37.139
Tuck your shirt in.

27:41.574 --> 27:43.553
One, two, three, 19.

27:43.709 --> 27:45.745
One, two, three, 20.

27:45.911 --> 27:47.981
One, two, three, 21.

27:48.147 --> 27:50.183
One, two, three, 22.

27:50.349 --> 27:52.294
One, two, three, 23.

27:52.451 --> 27:54.487
One, two, three, 24.

27:54.653 --> 27:56.655
One, two, three, 25.

27:56.822 --> 27:58.733
One, two, three, 26.

27:58.891 --> 28:00.927
One, two, three, 27.

28:01.093 --> 28:03.095
One, two, three, 28.

28:03.262 --> 28:05.207
One, two, three, 29.

28:05.364 --> 28:07.844
One, two, three, 30.

29:33.652 --> 29:35.131
Do it.

29:35.287 --> 29:36.527
Do it.

29:45.831 --> 29:49.005
Remember, it's just a bad dream, fat-boy.

30:17.296 --> 30:19.139
Port.

30:20.866 --> 30:23.346
Left shoulder.

30:25.604 --> 30:28.380
Right shoulder.

30:31.977 --> 30:33.547
Port.

30:36.615 --> 30:39.527
Do we love our beloved Corps, ladies?

30:39.685 --> 30:44.031
Semper fi, do or die.
Gung ho. Gung ho. Gung ho.

30:44.189 --> 30:46.328
What makes the grass grow?

30:46.592 --> 30:48.469
Blood, blood, blood.

30:48.627 --> 30:51.369
What do we do for a living, ladies?

30:51.530 --> 30:53.236
Kill, kill, kill.

30:53.399 --> 30:55.003
I can't hear you.

30:55.167 --> 30:56.873
Kill, kill, kill.

30:57.036 --> 31:00.107
Bullshit. I still can't hear you.

31:00.272 --> 31:01.910
Kill, kill, kill.

31:02.841 --> 31:06.618
Do any of you people know
who Charles Whitman was?

31:08.113 --> 31:10.616
None of you dumb-asses knows?

31:11.283 --> 31:12.955
Private Cowboy.

31:13.118 --> 31:17.498
Sir, he was that guy who shot all those
people from that tower in Austin, Texas, sir.

31:17.656 --> 31:20.500
That's affirmative.
Charles Whitman killed 12 people...

31:20.659 --> 31:24.868
...from a 28-story observation tower
at the University of Texas.

31:25.030 --> 31:27.942
From distances of up to 400 yards.

31:28.667 --> 31:31.943
Anybody know
who Lee Harvey Oswald was?

31:32.104 --> 31:33.173
Private Snowball.

31:33.939 --> 31:35.679
Sir, he shot Kennedy, sir.

31:35.841 --> 31:38.685
That's right.
And do you know how far away he was?

31:38.844 --> 31:43.190
Sir, he was pretty far.
From that book-suppository building, sir.

31:43.349 --> 31:45.328
All right, knock it off.

31:45.484 --> 31:47.395
Two hundred and fifty feet.

31:47.553 --> 31:51.762
He was 250 feet away
and shooting at a moving target.

31:51.924 --> 31:57.533
Oswald got off three rounds with an old
Italian bolt-action rifle in only six seconds...

31:57.696 --> 32:01.166
...and scored two hits,
including a head shot.

32:01.333 --> 32:05.508
Do any of you people know where
these individuals learned how to shoot?

32:06.372 --> 32:08.044
Private Joker.

32:08.207 --> 32:10.152
Sir, in the Marines, sir.

32:10.309 --> 32:12.846
In the Marines. Outstanding.

32:13.012 --> 32:17.984
Those individuals showed what one
motivated Marine and his rifle can do.

32:18.150 --> 32:20.721
And before you ladies leave my island...

32:20.886 --> 32:24.231
...you will all be able
to do the same thing.

32:44.276 --> 32:45.982
Today...

32:46.145 --> 32:48.318
...is Christmas.

32:48.480 --> 32:53.691
There will be a magic show at 0930.

32:54.053 --> 32:57.625
Chaplain Charlie will tell you...

32:57.790 --> 33:02.363
...about how the free world
will conquer communism...

33:02.528 --> 33:07.170
...with the aid of God and a few Marines.

33:07.700 --> 33:11.648
God has a hard-on for Marines...

33:11.804 --> 33:16.480
...because we kill everything we see.

33:16.642 --> 33:19.054
He plays his games...

33:19.211 --> 33:21.918
...we play ours.

33:22.081 --> 33:26.962
To show our appreciation
for so much power...

33:27.119 --> 33:32.500
...we keep heaven packed
with fresh souls.

33:33.258 --> 33:37.228
God was here before the Marine Corps.

33:37.396 --> 33:40.399
So you can give your heart to Jesus...

33:40.566 --> 33:44.275
...but your ass belongs to the Corps.

33:44.436 --> 33:46.415
Do you ladies understand?

33:46.572 --> 33:49.575
- Sir, yes, sir.
- I can't hear you.

33:49.742 --> 33:51.585
Sir, yes, sir.

33:57.349 --> 34:00.659
It's been swabbed and brushed.

34:02.020 --> 34:03.829
Everything...

34:04.723 --> 34:06.566
...is clean.

34:10.462 --> 34:12.235
Beautiful.

34:13.831 --> 34:16.471
So that it slides perfect.

34:18.837 --> 34:20.077
Nice.

34:22.373 --> 34:24.547
Everything clean.

34:25.377 --> 34:26.981
Oiled.

34:29.348 --> 34:32.226
So that your action is beautiful.

34:36.188 --> 34:38.429
Smooth Charlene.

35:00.646 --> 35:03.183
Leonard talks to his rifle.

35:05.417 --> 35:07.055
Yeah.

35:14.426 --> 35:17.497
I don't think Leonard
can hack it anymore.

35:18.764 --> 35:21.437
I think Leonard's a Section Eight.

35:25.037 --> 35:26.982
It don't surprise me.

35:37.549 --> 35:40.859
I wanna slip my tube steak
into your sister.

35:43.922 --> 35:46.129
What will you take in trade?

35:48.327 --> 35:50.272
What do you got?

36:04.877 --> 36:06.515
Outstanding, Private Pyle.

36:06.678 --> 36:09.385
I think we finally found
something that you do well.

36:09.548 --> 36:11.425
Sir, yes, sir.

36:14.786 --> 36:16.595
What's your sixth general order?

36:16.755 --> 36:19.235
Sir, the sixth general order
is to receive and obey...

36:19.391 --> 36:21.837
...and pass on to the sentry
who relieves me...

36:21.994 --> 36:23.768
...all orders...

36:23.929 --> 36:25.703
Sir, the private's sixth general...

36:25.898 --> 36:28.310
The private has been instructed
but does not know.

36:28.467 --> 36:31.743
You slimy scumbag,
get on your face and give me 25.

36:31.904 --> 36:34.008
Sir, aye, aye, sir.

36:38.243 --> 36:40.586
How many counts in that movement
you just executed?

36:40.746 --> 36:43.920
- Sir, four counts, sir.
- What's the idea of looking in the chamber?

36:44.082 --> 36:48.360
Sir, to guarantee the private is not giving
the inspecting officer a loaded weapon, sir.

36:48.520 --> 36:50.021
What's your fifth general order?

36:50.188 --> 36:54.227
Sir, the fifth general order is to quit my post
only when properly relieved, sir.

36:54.393 --> 36:56.202
What's this weapon's name,
Private Pyle?

36:56.361 --> 36:59.205
Sir, the private's weapon's name
is Charlene, sir.

36:59.364 --> 37:02.140
Private Pyle, you are definitely
born-again hard.

37:02.301 --> 37:05.907
Hell, I may even allow you to serve
as a rifleman in my beloved Corps.

37:06.071 --> 37:08.175
Sir, yes, sir.

37:10.609 --> 37:13.282
I don't want no teenage queen

37:13.445 --> 37:16.050
I don't want no teenage queen

37:16.214 --> 37:18.887
I just want my M14

37:19.051 --> 37:21.656
I just want my M14

37:21.820 --> 37:24.527
If I die in a combat zone

37:24.690 --> 37:27.261
If I die in a combat zone

37:27.426 --> 37:29.997
Box me up and ship me home

37:30.162 --> 37:32.801
Box me up and ship me home

37:32.965 --> 37:35.604
Pin my medals upon my chest

37:35.767 --> 37:38.372
Pin my medals upon my chest

37:38.537 --> 37:41.142
Tell my mom I done my best

37:41.306 --> 37:43.786
Tell my mom I done my best

37:45.310 --> 37:48.916
Graduation is only a few days away...

37:49.081 --> 37:53.654
...and the recruits of Platoon 3092
are salty.

37:53.819 --> 37:57.789
They are ready to eat their own guts
and ask for seconds.

37:58.357 --> 38:03.806
The drill instructors are proud to see
that we are growing beyond their control.

38:04.162 --> 38:07.575
The Marine Corps does not want robots.

38:07.733 --> 38:10.713
The Marine Corps wants killers.

38:10.869 --> 38:14.646
The Marine Corps wants to build
indestructible men.

38:14.806 --> 38:17.616
Men without fear.

38:19.678 --> 38:24.149
Today, you people are
no longer maggots.

38:25.684 --> 38:29.290
Today, you are Marines.

38:29.855 --> 38:32.699
You're part of a brotherhood.

38:32.858 --> 38:36.965
From now on, until the day you die...

38:37.129 --> 38:39.438
...wherever you are...

38:39.598 --> 38:43.102
...every Marine is your brother.

38:44.202 --> 38:47.308
Most of you will go to Vietnam.

38:47.472 --> 38:50.714
Some of you will not come back.

38:50.876 --> 38:53.083
But always remember this:

38:53.245 --> 38:55.122
Marines die.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.817
That's what we're here for.

38:57.983 --> 39:01.089
But the Marine Corps lives forever...

39:01.253 --> 39:05.997
...and that means you live forever.

39:09.861 --> 39:11.533
- Peckett.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:11.696 --> 39:13.368
0300, Infantry.

39:13.532 --> 39:15.136
- Toe Jam.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:15.300 --> 39:17.177
0300, Infantry.

39:17.335 --> 39:19.041
- Adams.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:19.204 --> 39:20.910
1800, Engineers.

39:21.073 --> 39:22.608
You go out and find mines.

39:22.774 --> 39:24.583
- Cowboy.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:24.743 --> 39:26.620
0300, Infantry.

39:26.778 --> 39:28.188
- Taylor.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:28.346 --> 39:30.155
0300, Infantry.

39:30.315 --> 39:31.919
- Joker.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:32.084 --> 39:35.224
4212, Basic Military Journalism.

39:35.387 --> 39:37.457
You gotta be shitting me, Joker.

39:37.622 --> 39:39.157
You think you're Mickey Spillane?

39:39.324 --> 39:41.360
You think you're some kind
of fucking writer?

39:41.526 --> 39:43.972
Sir, I wrote for
my high school newspaper, sir.

39:44.129 --> 39:47.804
Jesus H. Christ.
You're not a writer, you're a killer.

39:47.966 --> 39:49.206
A killer, yes, sir.

39:49.367 --> 39:50.937
Gomer Pyle.

39:51.103 --> 39:53.708
- Gomer Pyle.
- Sir, yes, sir.

39:53.872 --> 39:57.820
You forget your fucking name?
0300, Infantry. You made it.

39:57.976 --> 40:00.115
- Perkins.
- Sir, yes, sir.

40:04.282 --> 40:07.126
Our last night on the island.

40:07.285 --> 40:09.822
I draw fire watch.

41:12.617 --> 41:15.757
Hi, Joker.

41:37.742 --> 41:41.280
Are those live rounds?

41:47.285 --> 41:51.130
Seven-six-two millimeter.

41:52.757 --> 41:56.170
Full metal jacket.

42:04.736 --> 42:06.681
Leonard...

42:06.838 --> 42:10.717
...if Hartman comes in here
and catches us...

42:11.876 --> 42:14.947
...we'll both be in a world of shit.

42:18.216 --> 42:20.525
I am...

42:21.853 --> 42:24.265
...in a world...

42:25.790 --> 42:28.327
...of shit.

42:31.563 --> 42:32.803
Left shoulder.

42:35.367 --> 42:36.777
Right shoulder.

42:39.871 --> 42:41.145
Lock and load.

42:45.944 --> 42:47.320
Order.

42:50.148 --> 42:51.957
This is my rifle.

42:52.117 --> 42:54.893
There are many like it,
but this one is mine.

42:56.154 --> 42:59.464
My rifle is my best friend.
It is my life.

42:59.624 --> 43:02.127
Get back in your bunks.

43:02.294 --> 43:04.467
What is this Mickey Mouse shit?

43:04.629 --> 43:09.510
What in the name of Jesus H. Christ
are you animals doing in my head?

43:09.668 --> 43:13.013
Why is Private Pyle out of his bunk
after lights out?

43:13.171 --> 43:16.015
Why is Private Pyle
holding that weapon?

43:16.174 --> 43:19.553
Why aren't you stomping
Private Pyle's guts out?

43:19.711 --> 43:22.919
Sir, it is the private's duty
to inform the senior drill instructor...

43:23.081 --> 43:27.825
...that Private Pyle has a full magazine
and has locked and loaded, sir.

43:35.393 --> 43:39.136
Now you listen to me, Private Pyle...

43:39.297 --> 43:42.073
...and you listen good.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.775
I want that weapon...

43:44.936 --> 43:47.575
...and I want it now.

43:48.073 --> 43:52.351
You will place that rifle
on the deck at your feet...

43:52.510 --> 43:55.354
...and step back away from it.

44:02.787 --> 44:06.291
What is your major malfunction,
numb-nuts?

44:06.458 --> 44:10.736
Didn't Mommy and Daddy show you
enough attention when you were a child?

44:36.287 --> 44:38.357
Easy, Leonard.

44:41.826 --> 44:43.896
Go easy, man.

45:09.587 --> 45:10.827
No!

46:11.316 --> 46:12.988
Hey, baby.

46:13.151 --> 46:16.188
You got girlfriend Vietnam?

46:16.354 --> 46:18.993
Not just this minute.

46:19.157 --> 46:22.467
Well, baby, me so horny.

46:22.627 --> 46:24.800
Me so horny.

46:24.963 --> 46:27.534
Me love you long time.

46:28.066 --> 46:29.306
You party?

46:29.467 --> 46:31.606
Yeah, we might party.

46:31.769 --> 46:34.579
- How much?
- Fifteen dollar.

46:34.739 --> 46:38.778
- Fifteen dollars for both of us.
- No. Each you $15.

46:38.943 --> 46:40.888
Me love you long time.

46:41.045 --> 46:43.684
Me so horny.

46:43.848 --> 46:46.157
Fifteen dollar too beaucoup.

46:46.317 --> 46:49.593
- Five dollars each.
- Me sucky-sucky.

46:49.754 --> 46:52.359
Me love you too much.

46:53.758 --> 46:57.068
Five dollars is all my mom
allows me to spend.

46:57.228 --> 47:00.174
Okay. Ten dollar each.

47:00.331 --> 47:02.834
What do we get for $10?

47:03.001 --> 47:05.811
Everything you want.

47:05.970 --> 47:09.144
- Everything?
- Everything.

47:10.174 --> 47:14.281
Well, old buddy, feel like spending
some of your hard-earned money?

47:14.445 --> 47:16.356
Just a minute.

47:16.681 --> 47:20.822
You know, half these gook whores
are serving officers in the Vietcong.

47:20.985 --> 47:22.759
The other half have got TB.

47:23.588 --> 47:26.466
Be sure you only fuck
the ones that cough.

48:14.839 --> 48:18.115
That little sucker really had
some moves on him, didn't he?

48:18.276 --> 48:19.948
Yeah.

48:21.746 --> 48:24.351
You know what really pisses me off
about these people?

48:24.515 --> 48:25.857
What?

48:26.050 --> 48:29.895
We're supposed to be helping them, and
they shit all over us every chance they get.

48:30.054 --> 48:32.033
I just can't feature that.

48:32.190 --> 48:35.660
Don't take it too hard, Rafterman.
It's just business.

48:37.462 --> 48:40.841
I hate Da Nang, Joker.
I wanna go out into the field.

48:40.999 --> 48:42.978
I've been in country
almost three months...

48:43.134 --> 48:45.910
...and all I do is take handshake shots
at award ceremonies.

48:46.070 --> 48:49.107
You'd get wasted your first day in the field
and it'd be my fault.

48:49.273 --> 48:51.582
A high school girl could do my job.

48:51.743 --> 48:53.552
I wanna get out into the shit.

48:53.711 --> 48:56.316
I wanna get some trigger time.

48:57.215 --> 49:00.719
If you get killed, your mom will find me
after I rotate back to the world...

49:00.885 --> 49:02.659
...and she'll beat the shit out of me.

49:02.820 --> 49:05.300
That's a negative, Rafterman.

49:08.059 --> 49:12.029
Okay, guys. Let's keep it short and sweet
today. Anybody got anything new?

49:14.365 --> 49:18.040
There's a rumor going around that
the Tet ceasefire is gonna be canceled.

49:18.469 --> 49:19.970
Rear-echelon paranoia.

49:20.304 --> 49:24.445
A bro in intelligence says Charlie might try
to pull off something big during Tet.

49:24.609 --> 49:27.089
They say the same thing every year.

49:27.245 --> 49:29.054
There's a lot of talk about it, sir.

49:29.213 --> 49:31.022
I wouldn't lose any sleep over it.

49:31.182 --> 49:35.357
The Tet holiday is like the Fourth of July,
Christmas and New Year all rolled into one.

49:35.520 --> 49:38.899
Every zipperhead in Nam,
North and South, will be banging gongs...

49:39.057 --> 49:41.935
...barking at the moon
and visiting his dead relatives.

49:42.326 --> 49:45.705
Right. Ann-Margret
and entourage are due here next week.

49:45.863 --> 49:49.139
I want someone on the airfield
and stick with her for a couple of days.

49:49.300 --> 49:51.780
- Rafterman, you take it.
- Aye, aye, sir.

49:51.936 --> 49:53.642
And get some good low-angle stuff.

49:53.805 --> 49:57.878
Don't make it too obvious,
but I wanna see fur and early-morning dew.

49:58.042 --> 50:00.317
- Yes, sir.
- "Diplomats in dungarees.

50:00.478 --> 50:04.187
Marine engineers lend a helping hand
rebuilding Dong Phuc village recently..."

50:04.348 --> 50:07.658
Chili, if we move Vietnamese,
they are evacuees...

50:07.819 --> 50:10.925
...if they come to us to be evacuated,
they are refugees.

50:11.089 --> 50:12.863
I'll make a note of it, sir.

50:13.524 --> 50:16.061
"NVA soldier deserts
after reading pamphlets.

50:16.227 --> 50:20.266
A young North Vietnamese Army regular,
who realized his side could not win...

50:20.431 --> 50:23.241
...deserted from his unit after reading
Open Arms pamphlets."

50:23.401 --> 50:26.507
That's good, Dave. But why say
North Vietnamese Army regular?

50:26.671 --> 50:30.414
Is there an irregular?
How about North Vietnamese Army soldier?

50:30.575 --> 50:31.644
I'll fix it up, sir.

50:32.076 --> 50:34.112
Lawrence Welk Show
is out on TV in two weeks.

50:34.278 --> 50:35.449
Dave, do 100 words on it.

50:35.613 --> 50:38.150
- AFTV will give you some background stuff.
- Sir.

50:38.316 --> 50:40.090
"Not while we're eating.

50:40.251 --> 50:42.788
NVA learned Marines
on a search-and-destroy mission...

50:42.954 --> 50:45.297
...don't like to be interrupted
while eating chow."

50:45.456 --> 50:49.369
Search-and-destroy. We have a new
directive from MAF on this.

50:49.627 --> 50:54.132
In future, in place of search-and-destroy,
substitute the phrase sweep-and-clear.

50:54.298 --> 50:57.608
- Sweep-and-clear, got it?
- Got it. Very catchy.

50:58.436 --> 51:00.711
And, Joker, where's the weenie?

51:01.272 --> 51:02.842
Sir?

51:03.007 --> 51:06.955
The kill, Joker. The kill. I mean, all that fire,
the grunts must have hit something.

51:07.111 --> 51:08.385
Didn't see them.

51:09.413 --> 51:12.826
Joker, I've told you,
we run two basic stories here.

51:12.984 --> 51:16.454
Grunts who give half their pay to buy
gooks toothbrushes and deodorants.

51:16.621 --> 51:18.896
Winning of hearts and minds. Okay?

51:19.056 --> 51:22.662
And combat action that results in a kill.
Winning the war.

51:22.827 --> 51:26.536
Now, you must have seen blood trails.
Drag marks?

51:26.697 --> 51:28.369
It was raining, sir.

51:28.866 --> 51:31.710
Well, that's why God passed
the law of probability.

51:31.869 --> 51:34.975
Now rewrite it and give it
a happy ending. Say, one killed.

51:35.139 --> 51:37.516
Make it a sapper or an officer. Which?

51:38.009 --> 51:39.351
Whichever you say.

51:39.510 --> 51:41.990
Grunts like reading about dead officers.

51:42.146 --> 51:45.388
Okay, an officer. How about a general?

51:45.850 --> 51:47.158
Joker...

51:47.318 --> 51:50.731
...maybe you'd like our guys
to read the paper and feel bad.

51:50.888 --> 51:54.028
I mean, in case you didn't know it,
this is not a very popular war.

51:54.192 --> 51:56.331
Now, it is our job to report the news...

51:56.494 --> 51:59.565
...that these why-are-we-here
civilian newsmen ignore.

52:00.331 --> 52:03.937
Sir, maybe you should go out
on some ops yourself.

52:04.101 --> 52:07.844
I'm sure you could find a lot more
blood trails and drag marks.

52:08.439 --> 52:10.441
Joker, I've had my ass in the grass.

52:10.608 --> 52:12.587
Can't say I liked it much.

52:12.743 --> 52:15.746
Lots of bugs and too dangerous.

52:15.913 --> 52:18.950
As it happens, my present duties
keep me where I belong...

52:19.116 --> 52:21.323
...in the rear with the gear.

52:29.026 --> 52:31.836
Tet. The year of the monkey.

52:31.996 --> 52:35.136
Vietnamese Lunar New Year's Eve.

52:35.299 --> 52:40.407
Down in Dogpatch, the gooks are
shooting off fireworks to celebrate.

52:49.113 --> 52:52.788
I am fucking bored to death, man.

52:53.384 --> 52:55.864
I gotta get back in the shit.

52:56.020 --> 52:59.126
I ain't heard a shot fired
in anger in weeks.

52:59.924 --> 53:01.300
Joker's so tough...

53:01.525 --> 53:04.938
...he'd eat the boogers
out of a dead man's nose...

53:05.096 --> 53:07.007
...then ask for seconds.

53:07.498 --> 53:09.568
Listen up, pilgrim.

53:09.734 --> 53:14.239
A day without blood is
like a day without sunshine.

53:14.705 --> 53:16.013
Shit.

53:16.173 --> 53:20.086
Joker thinks the bad bush is between
an old mama-san's legs.

53:20.244 --> 53:22.189
He's never been in the shit.

53:22.346 --> 53:25.088
It's hard to talk about it, man.
It's like on Hastings.

53:25.249 --> 53:27.786
You weren't on
Operation Hastings, Payback.

53:27.952 --> 53:30.625
- You weren't even in country.
- Eat shit and die...

53:30.788 --> 53:33.666
...you fucking Spanish-American.
You fucking pogue.

53:33.824 --> 53:35.234
I was there, man.

53:35.393 --> 53:37.133
I was in the shit with the grunts.

53:37.295 --> 53:41.106
Don't listen to
any of Payback's bullshit, Rafterman.

53:41.265 --> 53:44.678
Sometimes he thinks he's John Wayne.

53:45.369 --> 53:46.848
You listen to Joker, new guy.

53:47.004 --> 53:48.642
He knows tí ti.

53:48.806 --> 53:50.341
Very little.

53:50.508 --> 53:53.318
You know he's never been in the shit.
He ain't got the stare.

53:53.477 --> 53:57.015
- The stare?
- The thousand-yard stare.

53:57.181 --> 54:00.184
A Marine gets it after he's been
in the shit for too long.

54:00.351 --> 54:01.886
It's like...

54:02.286 --> 54:04.197
It's like you're really seeing beyond.

54:04.922 --> 54:06.162
I got it.

54:06.324 --> 54:08.167
All field Marines got it.

54:08.326 --> 54:09.827
And you'll have it too.

54:09.994 --> 54:11.302
I will?

54:11.462 --> 54:13.032
Hey, Payback...

54:13.197 --> 54:16.303
...how do you stop five black dudes
from raping a white chick?

54:16.901 --> 54:19.813
- Fuck you, Stork.
- Throw them a basketball.

54:24.809 --> 54:26.913
- Incoming.
- Oh, shit.

54:28.579 --> 54:30.490
Them are outgoing.

54:32.416 --> 54:34.657
- That ain't outgoing.
- That ain't outgoing.

54:34.819 --> 54:36.457
Now, what did I just say?

55:14.558 --> 55:17.800
Hey, I hope they're just fucking with us.

55:17.962 --> 55:21.238
- I ain't ready for this shit.
- Amen.

56:14.151 --> 56:16.062
Cease fire.

56:20.124 --> 56:22.263
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

56:25.896 --> 56:27.898
Cease fire.

56:38.876 --> 56:40.878
The enemy...

56:41.045 --> 56:43.548
...has very deceitfully...

56:43.714 --> 56:46.592
...taken advantage
of the Tet ceasefire...

56:46.750 --> 56:50.095
...to launch an offensive
all over the country.

56:50.421 --> 56:54.096
So far, we've had it pretty easy here.

56:54.258 --> 56:56.465
But we seem to be the exception.

56:57.194 --> 57:01.972
Charlie has hit every major military target
in Vietnam and hit them hard.

57:02.133 --> 57:08.015
In Saigon the United States Embassy
has been overrun by suicide squads.

57:08.172 --> 57:10.117
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ, man.

57:10.274 --> 57:13.812
Khe Sanh is standing by to be overrun.

57:15.079 --> 57:17.650
We also have reports
that a division of NVA...

57:17.815 --> 57:22.764
...has occupied all of the city of Hue
south of the Perfume River.

57:22.920 --> 57:25.991
In strategic terms,
Charlie's cut the country in half...

57:26.157 --> 57:28.933
...the civilian press
are about to wet their pants...

57:29.093 --> 57:34.042
...and we've heard even Cronkite's
gonna say the war is now unwinnable.

57:34.632 --> 57:36.372
In other words...

57:36.534 --> 57:41.380
...it's a huge shit sandwich
and we're all gonna have to take a bite.

57:44.241 --> 57:46.015
Sir.

57:46.310 --> 57:49.188
Does this mean that Ann-Margret's
not coming?

57:53.984 --> 57:58.364
Joker, I want you
to get straight up to Phú Bai.

57:58.822 --> 58:02.030
Captain January will need all his people.

58:02.193 --> 58:04.468
- Yes, sir.
- And, Joker...

58:04.628 --> 58:07.631
...you will take off that damn button.

58:07.798 --> 58:11.245
How's it gonna look if you get killed
wearing a peace symbol?

58:11.402 --> 58:12.881
Sir.

58:13.037 --> 58:15.244
Permission to go with Joker?

58:15.940 --> 58:17.919
- Permission granted.
- Thank you, sir.

58:18.075 --> 58:21.021
Sir, permission not to take
Rafterman with me?

58:21.178 --> 58:23.282
You still here?

58:23.447 --> 58:27.087
Vanish, Joker, most ricky-tick,
and take Rafterman with you.

58:27.251 --> 58:29.594
You're responsible for him.

59:05.422 --> 59:07.060
Get some.

59:07.891 --> 59:09.631
Get some.

59:12.229 --> 59:15.141
Get some. Get some. Yeah. Yeah.

59:16.133 --> 59:19.876
Get some. Get some.
Come on. Come on.

59:23.907 --> 59:25.511
Get some.

59:33.017 --> 59:35.190
Get some, baby.

59:35.519 --> 59:37.931
Get some. Get some. Get some.

59:38.922 --> 59:41.561
Get some. Get some, come on.
Get it, come on.

59:41.725 --> 59:44.228
Get some. Get some. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

59:44.395 --> 59:46.602
I've got you, mother.

59:51.435 --> 59:54.575
Anyone who runs is a VC.

59:55.139 --> 59:57.676
Anyone who stands still...

59:57.841 --> 01:00:00.787
...is a well-disciplined VC.

01:00:02.713 --> 01:00:06.353
You guys ought to do a story
about me sometime.

01:00:07.518 --> 01:00:10.589
Why should we do a story about you?

01:00:10.954 --> 01:00:13.058
Because I'm so fucking good.

01:00:13.223 --> 01:00:15.362
That ain't no shit neither.

01:00:15.526 --> 01:00:19.997
I've done got me 157 dead gooks killed.

01:00:20.164 --> 01:00:22.940
And 50 water buffaloes too.

01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:25.910
Them are all certified.

01:00:26.070 --> 01:00:28.948
Any women or children?

01:00:29.440 --> 01:00:31.078
Sometimes.

01:00:32.209 --> 01:00:35.918
How can you shoot women and children?

01:00:36.513 --> 01:00:37.821
Easy.

01:00:37.981 --> 01:00:40.393
You just don't lead them so much.

01:00:41.919 --> 01:00:43.898
Ain't war hell?

01:01:20.457 --> 01:01:22.596
Top, we wanna get in the shit.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:24.261
Down the road. Two-Five.

01:01:24.428 --> 01:01:27.204
Two-Five. Outstanding. Thanks, Top.

01:01:51.955 --> 01:01:53.593
Excuse me.

01:01:53.757 --> 01:01:55.133
Sir.

01:01:55.292 --> 01:01:58.398
We're looking for 1st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

01:01:58.562 --> 01:02:00.006
I got a bro named Cowboy there.

01:02:00.164 --> 01:02:01.574
You people one-one?

01:02:01.732 --> 01:02:04.041
No, sir.
We're reporters from Stars and Stripes.

01:02:04.201 --> 01:02:06.044
- Stars and Stripes?
- Yes, sir.

01:02:06.203 --> 01:02:08.239
I'm Cowboy's platoon commander.

01:02:08.405 --> 01:02:11.215
Cowboy's just down the road
in the platoon area.

01:02:11.375 --> 01:02:15.050
- You mind if we tag along, sir?
- No problem. Welcome aboard.

01:02:15.212 --> 01:02:18.454
By the way, my name's Schinoski.
Walter J. Schinoski.

01:02:18.615 --> 01:02:20.856
My people call me Mr. Touchdown.

01:02:21.018 --> 01:02:22.519
I played ball for Notre Dame.

01:02:22.686 --> 01:02:23.994
- Notre Dame?
- Yeah.

01:02:24.154 --> 01:02:26.861
- All right.
- You here to make Cowboy famous?

01:02:27.024 --> 01:02:28.628
Never happen, sir.

01:02:28.792 --> 01:02:33.070
Well, if you people came looking for a story,
this is your lucky day.

01:02:33.230 --> 01:02:36.404
We got Condition Red
and we're definitely expecting rain.

01:02:36.567 --> 01:02:39.343
Outstanding, sir.
We taking care of business?

01:02:39.503 --> 01:02:41.004
Well, the NVA are dug in deep.

01:02:41.171 --> 01:02:43.708
Hotel Company's still working
this side of the river...

01:02:43.874 --> 01:02:46.081
...street by street and house by house.

01:02:46.243 --> 01:02:48.245
Charles definitely
got his shit together...

01:02:48.412 --> 01:02:50.687
...but we're still getting
some decent kills here.

01:02:50.848 --> 01:02:55.057
We heard some scuttlebutt, sir, about
the NVA executing a lot of gook civilians.

01:02:55.219 --> 01:02:56.663
That's affirmative.

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.460
I saw some bodies about a half a klick
this side of Phu Cam Canal.

01:03:00.624 --> 01:03:02.797
Will you show me where, sir?

01:03:05.162 --> 01:03:06.732
Here's the canal.

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:32.894
The dead have been covered with lime.

01:03:34.091 --> 01:03:36.969
The dead know only one thing:

01:03:37.628 --> 01:03:40.165
It is better to be alive.

01:03:46.470 --> 01:03:48.074
Excuse me?

01:03:48.238 --> 01:03:50.513
- Good morning, lieutenant.
- Morning.

01:03:50.674 --> 01:03:54.246
I make it 20.
Is that the official body count, sir?

01:03:54.411 --> 01:03:55.855
What outfit are you men with?

01:03:56.013 --> 01:03:58.152
Sir, we're reporters
from Stars and Stripes.

01:03:58.415 --> 01:03:59.950
- Oh, I see.
- I'm Sergeant Joker...

01:04:00.117 --> 01:04:02.426
...and this photographer is Rafterman.

01:04:02.586 --> 01:04:05.191
I'm Lieutenant Cleves
and I'm from Hartford, Connecticut.

01:04:05.355 --> 01:04:08.301
- Have you got a body count, sir?
- We think it's 20.

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:10.562
Do you know how it happened, sir?

01:04:10.928 --> 01:04:14.705
Well, it seems the NVA came in
with a list of gook names.

01:04:14.865 --> 01:04:19.438
Government officials, policemen,
ARVIN officers, school teachers.

01:04:19.603 --> 01:04:21.605
They went around
to their houses real polite...

01:04:21.772 --> 01:04:25.117
...and asked them to report
the next day for political reeducation.

01:04:25.609 --> 01:04:27.884
Everybody who turned up got shot.

01:04:28.045 --> 01:04:29.683
Some they buried alive.

01:04:29.913 --> 01:04:31.221
Ready.

01:04:32.816 --> 01:04:34.260
Colonel.

01:04:35.786 --> 01:04:38.493
Marine, what is that button
on your body armor?

01:04:38.655 --> 01:04:39.929
A peace symbol, sir.

01:04:40.090 --> 01:04:42.695
- Where did you get it?
- I don't remember, sir.

01:04:43.126 --> 01:04:45.003
What is that written on your helmet?

01:04:45.162 --> 01:04:46.641
Born to kill, sir.

01:04:46.863 --> 01:04:49.843
You write born to kill on your helmet
and wear a peace button.

01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.343
What's that supposed to be,
some kind of sick joke?

01:04:52.502 --> 01:04:55.073
- No, sir.
- What is it supposed to mean?

01:04:55.238 --> 01:04:56.614
I don't know, sir.

01:04:56.773 --> 01:04:58.252
- You don't know much.
- No, sir.

01:04:58.408 --> 01:05:01.684
Get your head and your ass wired together
or I will take a shit on you.

01:05:01.845 --> 01:05:03.585
- Yes, sir.
- Now answer my question...

01:05:03.747 --> 01:05:06.124
...or you'll be standing tall
before the man.

01:05:06.283 --> 01:05:09.263
I was trying to suggest something
about the duality of man, sir.

01:05:09.419 --> 01:05:13.025
- The what?
- The duality of man. The Jungian thing, sir.

01:05:14.224 --> 01:05:16.465
- Whose side are you on, son?
- Our side, sir.

01:05:16.627 --> 01:05:18.265
- You love your country?
- Yes, sir.

01:05:18.428 --> 01:05:20.032
How about getting with the program.

01:05:20.197 --> 01:05:22.643
Jump on the team and come on in
for the big win.

01:05:22.799 --> 01:05:23.834
Yes, sir.

01:05:24.001 --> 01:05:28.472
All I've asked of my Marines is for them to
obey my orders as they would God's word.

01:05:28.639 --> 01:05:30.379
We are here to help the Vietnamese...

01:05:30.540 --> 01:05:34.488
...because inside every gook
there is an American trying to get out.

01:05:34.645 --> 01:05:36.317
It's a hardball world, son.

01:05:36.480 --> 01:05:40.120
We've gotta try to keep our heads
until this peace craze blows over.

01:05:40.283 --> 01:05:41.318
Aye, aye, sir.

01:05:51.762 --> 01:05:55.505
Hey, bro. We're looking for 1st Platoon,
Hotel Two-Five.

01:05:55.666 --> 01:05:57.475
Around the back.

01:06:06.076 --> 01:06:09.182
- First Platoon?
- Yeah, through there.

01:06:32.869 --> 01:06:34.939
Hey, Lone Ranger.

01:06:38.975 --> 01:06:42.650
- Holy shit. It's the Joker.
- You old motherfucker.

01:06:47.718 --> 01:06:48.719
What's happening?

01:06:48.885 --> 01:06:52.730
Thought I hoped I'd never see you again,
you piece of shit.

01:06:53.223 --> 01:06:54.758
What's happening, man?

01:06:54.925 --> 01:06:58.338
Oh, just waiting to get back
to the land of the big PX.

01:06:58.495 --> 01:07:00.474
Yeah? Well, why go back?

01:07:00.630 --> 01:07:02.165
Here or there, samey-same.

01:07:02.332 --> 01:07:04.038
- Been getting any?
- Only your sister.

01:07:04.201 --> 01:07:08.308
Well, better my sister than my mom,
though my mom's not bad.

01:07:08.905 --> 01:07:11.510
Hey, you Hogs, listen up.

01:07:11.675 --> 01:07:14.849
This is my bro, Joker, from the Island,
and this is...?

01:07:15.011 --> 01:07:16.990
- Rafterman.
- Rafterman.

01:07:17.147 --> 01:07:19.991
They're from Stars and Stripes.
They'll make you famous.

01:07:20.150 --> 01:07:21.458
- Fucking A.
- Yeah.

01:07:21.618 --> 01:07:23.563
We're the Lusthog Squad.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.291
We're life-takers and heartbreakers.

01:07:26.456 --> 01:07:29.960
We shoot them full of holes
and fill them full of lead.

01:07:34.397 --> 01:07:37.104
You a photographer?

01:07:38.535 --> 01:07:41.106
No, I'm a combat correspondent.

01:07:42.105 --> 01:07:44.585
Oh, you seen much combat?

01:07:47.344 --> 01:07:49.721
Well, I've seen a little on TV.

01:07:54.050 --> 01:07:56.826
You're a real comedian.

01:07:58.088 --> 01:08:00.830
Well, they call me the Joker.

01:08:02.092 --> 01:08:04.572
Well, I got a joke for you.

01:08:04.728 --> 01:08:08.004
I'm gonna tear you a new asshole.

01:08:11.201 --> 01:08:13.078
Well, pilgrim...

01:08:13.236 --> 01:08:18.377
...only after you eat the peanuts
out of my shit.

01:08:23.779 --> 01:08:25.884
You talk the talk.

01:08:27.082 --> 01:08:29.926
Do you walk the walk?

01:08:34.323 --> 01:08:35.825
Now, you might not believe it...

01:08:36.225 --> 01:08:41.265
...but under fire, Animal Mother's one of
the finest human beings in the world.

01:08:41.430 --> 01:08:45.572
All he needs is somebody to throw
hand grenades at him the rest of his life.

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:49.910
That's a roger, come on.
Sit down. Come on, new guy.

01:08:52.642 --> 01:08:54.917
Hey, jungle-bunny.

01:08:55.078 --> 01:08:57.888
Thank God for the sickle cell, huh?

01:08:58.048 --> 01:08:59.890
Yeah, Mother.

01:09:01.151 --> 01:09:02.960
Hey, photographer.

01:09:04.354 --> 01:09:06.390
You wanna take a good picture?

01:09:07.657 --> 01:09:09.100
Here, man.

01:09:09.426 --> 01:09:10.904
Take this.

01:09:19.769 --> 01:09:22.647
This is my bro.

01:09:32.215 --> 01:09:34.319
This is his party.

01:09:34.484 --> 01:09:36.657
He's the guest of honor.

01:09:37.587 --> 01:09:40.260
Today is his birthday.

01:09:40.857 --> 01:09:43.667
Happy birthday, zipperhead.

01:09:44.661 --> 01:09:47.073
I will never forget this day.

01:09:47.229 --> 01:09:52.542
The day I came to Hue City
and fought 1 million NVA gooks.

01:09:53.002 --> 01:09:56.313
I love the little commie bastards, man,
I really do.

01:09:56.773 --> 01:10:00.015
These enemy grunts are as hard
as slant-eyed drill instructors.

01:10:01.978 --> 01:10:04.958
These are great days we're living, bros.

01:10:06.082 --> 01:10:10.121
We are jolly green giants,
walking the earth with guns.

01:10:10.854 --> 01:10:13.266
These people we wasted here today...

01:10:13.423 --> 01:10:16.665
...are the finest human beings
we will ever know.

01:10:18.461 --> 01:10:20.133
After we rotate back to the world...

01:10:20.297 --> 01:10:23.607
...we're gonna miss not having
anyone around who's worth shooting.

01:11:30.066 --> 01:11:32.739
- Stay put, keep your heads down.
- Stay put.

01:11:32.902 --> 01:11:34.540
Stay put.

01:11:49.686 --> 01:11:51.756
Shit.

01:11:59.629 --> 01:12:03.133
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

01:12:04.834 --> 01:12:08.509
Delta Six Actual, this is Murphy. Over.

01:12:09.639 --> 01:12:11.015
Delta Six.

01:12:11.174 --> 01:12:14.314
Delta Six, we are receiving incoming fire
from the vill.

01:12:14.778 --> 01:12:16.382
The lieutenant is down.

01:12:16.546 --> 01:12:19.549
We're going to stop here
and check out what's in front of us. Over.

01:12:25.155 --> 01:12:27.635
Okay, Lusthog Squad, listen up.

01:12:28.324 --> 01:12:30.428
Gonna move up these roads
and check the vill.

01:12:30.593 --> 01:12:32.970
I want the third team up this road here.

01:12:33.129 --> 01:12:37.042
First and second fire team behind me
up this other road, okay?

01:12:37.500 --> 01:12:40.378
Let's go. Let's get it done.

01:17:07.570 --> 01:17:10.277
Is that you, John Wayne? Is this me?

01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:13.614
Hey, start the cameras.
This is Vietnam: The Movie.

01:17:13.776 --> 01:17:16.153
Yeah, Joker can be John Wayne,
I'll be a horse.

01:17:16.312 --> 01:17:18.985
- T.H.E. Rock can be a rock.
- I'll be Ann-Margret.

01:17:19.148 --> 01:17:21.093
Animal Mother can be a rabid buffalo.

01:17:21.250 --> 01:17:23.753
- I'll be General Custer.
- Who'll be the Indian?

01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:26.957
Hey, we'll let the gooks play the Indians.

01:18:05.128 --> 01:18:07.130
You're going home now.

01:18:11.134 --> 01:18:12.977
Semper fi.

01:18:15.938 --> 01:18:18.543
We're mean Marines, sir.

01:18:21.911 --> 01:18:24.050
Go easy, bros.

01:18:28.184 --> 01:18:30.254
Better you than me.

01:18:33.956 --> 01:18:36.629
Well, at least they died
for a good cause.

01:18:37.427 --> 01:18:39.668
What cause was that?

01:18:41.164 --> 01:18:42.734
Freedom.

01:18:43.533 --> 01:18:46.479
Flush out your headgear, new guy.

01:18:48.171 --> 01:18:51.049
You think we waste gooks for freedom?

01:18:52.175 --> 01:18:54.382
This is a slaughter.

01:18:55.611 --> 01:18:59.149
If I'm gonna get my balls
blown off for a word...

01:19:00.216 --> 01:19:03.128
...my word is poon tang.

01:19:05.855 --> 01:19:08.597
Tough break for Hand Job.

01:19:09.492 --> 01:19:12.962
He was all set
to get shipped out on a medical.

01:19:14.497 --> 01:19:16.476
What was the matter with him?

01:19:18.801 --> 01:19:22.009
He was jerking off 10 times a day.

01:19:23.105 --> 01:19:26.711
It's no shit. At least 10 times a day.

01:19:28.644 --> 01:19:33.991
Last week he was sent down to Da Nang
to see the Navy head shrinker.

01:19:34.383 --> 01:19:38.456
The crazy fucker starts jerking off
in the waiting room.

01:19:38.988 --> 01:19:41.559
Instant Section Eight.

01:19:42.225 --> 01:19:45.672
He was just waiting
for his papers to clear Division.

01:19:48.164 --> 01:19:51.042
You ready? Turn over.

01:19:52.568 --> 01:19:54.877
Hue City interviews, roll 34.

01:19:56.973 --> 01:20:00.977
Well, like... Like you see, you know,
it's a major city...

01:20:01.143 --> 01:20:04.681
...so we have to assault with tanks,
we roll in the streets.

01:20:04.847 --> 01:20:07.259
So they send us in first to squat...

01:20:07.416 --> 01:20:11.159
...make sure that there are no little...

01:20:12.288 --> 01:20:15.530
No Vietnamese waiting with B-40 rockets
to blow the tanks away.

01:20:15.691 --> 01:20:18.194
So we clear it out
and we roll the tanks in...

01:20:18.361 --> 01:20:20.704
...and basically blow the place to hell.

01:20:21.297 --> 01:20:24.903
When we're in Hue,
when we're in Hue City...

01:20:25.067 --> 01:20:27.046
...it's like a war, you know...

01:20:27.203 --> 01:20:29.114
...like what... What...

01:20:29.272 --> 01:20:32.275
What I thought about a war,
what I thought a war was...

01:20:32.441 --> 01:20:34.921
You know, was supposed to be.

01:20:36.112 --> 01:20:38.319
There's the enemy, you kill them.

01:20:38.915 --> 01:20:42.055
I don't think there's any question about it.
I mean, we're the best.

01:20:42.218 --> 01:20:44.357
I mean, all that bullshit
about the Air Cav...

01:20:44.520 --> 01:20:46.659
When the shit hits the fan,
who do they call?

01:20:46.822 --> 01:20:50.167
They call Mother Green
and her killing machine.

01:20:50.326 --> 01:20:53.329
Do I think America belongs in Vietnam?

01:20:53.996 --> 01:20:57.944
I don't know.
I belong in Vietnam, I'll tell you that.

01:20:58.100 --> 01:21:00.341
Can I quote LBJ?

01:21:01.871 --> 01:21:05.375
"I will not send American boys...

01:21:05.541 --> 01:21:07.816
...8 or 10,000 miles
around the world...

01:21:07.977 --> 01:21:12.186
...to do a job that Asian boys
ought to be doing for themselves."

01:21:14.083 --> 01:21:18.429
Personally think they don't really
want to be involved in this war...

01:21:18.588 --> 01:21:22.365
...you know, I mean, like they...
It's sort of like...

01:21:22.892 --> 01:21:26.305
...they took away our freedom
and gave it to the gookers, you know.

01:21:26.462 --> 01:21:28.032
But they don't want it.

01:21:28.197 --> 01:21:30.643
They'd rather be alive than free, I guess,
you know.

01:21:30.800 --> 01:21:32.802
Poor, dumb bastards.

01:21:33.669 --> 01:21:38.413
Well, the ones I'm fighting at
are some pretty... Pretty bad boys.

01:21:38.574 --> 01:21:40.348
I'm not real...

01:21:41.510 --> 01:21:44.354
I'm not real keen
on some of these fellas...

01:21:44.513 --> 01:21:47.960
...that are supposedly on our side.

01:21:48.117 --> 01:21:50.961
I keep meeting them
coming the other way.

01:21:53.022 --> 01:21:54.057
Yeah.

01:21:54.624 --> 01:21:56.831
I mean, we're getting killed
for these people...

01:21:56.993 --> 01:21:59.166
...and they don't even appreciate it.

01:21:59.829 --> 01:22:01.774
They think it's a big joke.

01:22:02.398 --> 01:22:04.400
Well, if you ask me...

01:22:04.867 --> 01:22:06.903
...we're shooting the wrong gooks.

01:22:07.370 --> 01:22:10.908
Well, it depends on the situation.
I mean, I'm here to take combat photos.

01:22:11.073 --> 01:22:14.645
But if the shit gets too thick,
I mean, I'll go to the rifle.

01:22:15.645 --> 01:22:18.421
What do I think about
America's involvement in the war?

01:22:18.581 --> 01:22:20.355
Well, I think we should win.

01:22:20.983 --> 01:22:22.985
I hate Vietnam.

01:22:23.152 --> 01:22:25.188
There's not one horse
in this whole country.

01:22:25.354 --> 01:22:27.493
They don't have one horse in Vietnam.

01:22:27.657 --> 01:22:30.262
There's something
basically wrong with that.

01:22:31.661 --> 01:22:33.640
Well, if they'd send us
more guys, maybe...

01:22:33.796 --> 01:22:37.835
...and bomb the hell out of the North,
they might give up.

01:22:38.601 --> 01:22:44.141
I wanted to see exotic Vietnam,
the jewel of Southeast Asia.

01:22:44.740 --> 01:22:49.120
I wanted to meet interesting and
stimulating people of an ancient culture...

01:22:49.278 --> 01:22:50.586
...and kill them.

01:22:51.013 --> 01:22:55.859
I wanted to be the first kid on my block
to get a confirmed kill.

01:23:14.537 --> 01:23:16.710
Ten-hut.

01:23:18.507 --> 01:23:20.042
- All right.
- My, oh, my.

01:23:20.209 --> 01:23:23.121
- Good morning, little schoolgirl.
- Look at this lady.

01:23:23.279 --> 01:23:25.383
I'm a little schoolboy too.

01:23:25.748 --> 01:23:27.056
My, my, my.

01:23:27.616 --> 01:23:30.926
- What you got there, chief?
- Do you want number one fucky?

01:23:32.088 --> 01:23:34.932
Hey, any of you boys
want number one fucky?

01:23:35.091 --> 01:23:37.503
I'm so horny,
I can't even get a piece of hand.

01:23:37.660 --> 01:23:40.868
- Me want sucky.
- Sucky, fucky, smoke cigarette in her pussy.

01:23:41.030 --> 01:23:43.601
She give you everything you want,
long time.

01:23:43.799 --> 01:23:47.747
Everything you want.
Hey, how much there, chief?

01:23:47.903 --> 01:23:50.178
- Fifteen dollars each.
- No.

01:23:52.508 --> 01:23:55.181
Fifteen dollar beaucoup money.

01:23:55.344 --> 01:23:56.618
Five dollar each.

01:23:56.779 --> 01:23:58.588
Come on, she love you good.

01:23:58.748 --> 01:24:00.283
Boom-boom long time.

01:24:00.449 --> 01:24:02.155
- Ten dollars.
- Five dollars.

01:24:02.318 --> 01:24:03.797
No. Ten dollars.

01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:06.160
Be glad to trade you some ARVIN rifles.

01:24:06.322 --> 01:24:09.166
Ain't never been fired
and only dropped once.

01:24:10.059 --> 01:24:11.833
Okay, $5. You give me.

01:24:11.994 --> 01:24:14.337
- Okay, okay.
- All right.

01:24:15.598 --> 01:24:16.974
Let's get mounted.

01:24:22.371 --> 01:24:23.941
Something wrong there, chief?

01:24:24.106 --> 01:24:26.085
She says no boom-boom
with soul brother.

01:24:26.242 --> 01:24:27.812
What the motherfuck?

01:24:27.977 --> 01:24:30.514
She says soul brother too beaucoup,
too beaucoup.

01:24:30.679 --> 01:24:32.021
What is this, man?

01:24:32.181 --> 01:24:37.255
I think what he's trying to tell you
is you black boys pack too much meat.

01:24:38.254 --> 01:24:40.961
Too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

01:24:41.123 --> 01:24:42.795
Oh, shit.

01:24:42.958 --> 01:24:46.667
This baby-san looks like she could
suck the chrome off a trailer hitch.

01:24:46.829 --> 01:24:49.900
She say too beaucoup, too beaucoup.

01:24:50.065 --> 01:24:52.010
Excuse me, ma'am.

01:24:52.701 --> 01:24:54.703
What we have here, little yellow sister...

01:24:54.870 --> 01:24:59.318
...is a magnificent specimen
of pure Alabama blacksnake.

01:24:59.508 --> 01:25:02.079
But it ain't too goddamn beaucoup.

01:25:03.112 --> 01:25:05.057
Okay, okay.

01:25:05.748 --> 01:25:07.727
Okay, okay.

01:25:09.051 --> 01:25:11.326
All right. Yeah. This is my boogie.

01:25:11.487 --> 01:25:13.694
- Hey, we need a batting order.
- I'm going first.

01:25:13.856 --> 01:25:17.269
Back off, white bread.
Don't get between a dog and his meat.

01:25:17.426 --> 01:25:20.736
All fucking niggers must fucking hang.

01:25:20.896 --> 01:25:24.036
- Hey, Animal, man.
- You son of a...

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:28.341
Hey, hey, I won't be long.
I'll skip the foreplay.

01:25:28.504 --> 01:25:30.813
- I don't want it after you, man.
- Fuck you.

01:26:04.006 --> 01:26:06.315
Intelligence passed the word down...

01:26:06.475 --> 01:26:10.047
...that during the night
the NVA had pulled out of our area...

01:26:10.212 --> 01:26:13.192
...to positions across the Perfume River.

01:26:13.349 --> 01:26:17.763
Our squad is sent on patrol
to check out the report.

01:26:49.218 --> 01:26:51.994
Face outboard and take cover. Do it.

01:27:05.467 --> 01:27:07.002
Shit.

01:27:15.577 --> 01:27:17.488
He ain't gonna make it.

01:27:20.382 --> 01:27:22.020
Shit.

01:27:28.524 --> 01:27:31.800
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

01:27:33.228 --> 01:27:36.732
Hotel One Actual, this is Cowboy.

01:27:37.599 --> 01:27:39.100
Hotel One. Over.

01:27:39.268 --> 01:27:41.304
Murph, this is Cowboy.

01:27:41.470 --> 01:27:44.815
Crazy's hit. Booby trap.

01:27:46.008 --> 01:27:47.714
Wait, One.

01:27:48.877 --> 01:27:53.348
Okay. You're senior NCO, Cowboy.
You're in charge.

01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:55.253
- Continue with the patrol...
- Shit.

01:27:55.417 --> 01:27:57.726
...and call in at the next checkpoint.
- Shit.

01:27:57.886 --> 01:28:00.628
Roger. Out.

01:28:07.029 --> 01:28:08.906
I'm squad leader.

01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:14.312
Follow you anywhere, scumbag.

01:28:15.404 --> 01:28:16.974
All right.

01:28:17.773 --> 01:28:19.343
He's dead.

01:29:00.449 --> 01:29:01.984
Cowboy.

01:29:08.791 --> 01:29:10.065
What's up?

01:29:10.325 --> 01:29:13.567
I think we made a mistake
at the last checkpoint.

01:29:13.729 --> 01:29:16.141
Here, see what you think.

01:29:18.233 --> 01:29:21.270
I think we're here...

01:29:21.804 --> 01:29:24.750
...and we should be here.

01:29:26.341 --> 01:29:28.480
- We're here?
- Yeah.

01:29:28.644 --> 01:29:31.920
- We should be here?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's right.

01:29:38.053 --> 01:29:39.793
Fuck.

01:29:45.127 --> 01:29:46.765
What do you think?

01:29:48.397 --> 01:29:51.173
Well, I think we should change direction.

01:30:05.114 --> 01:30:06.684
Okay.

01:30:07.316 --> 01:30:09.352
We'll change direction.

01:30:19.995 --> 01:30:21.565
What's up?

01:30:21.730 --> 01:30:23.675
Changing direction.

01:30:24.366 --> 01:30:25.606
What are we, lost?

01:30:25.767 --> 01:30:28.873
Joker, shut the fuck up.

01:30:29.171 --> 01:30:31.310
Okay, listen up.

01:30:31.473 --> 01:30:33.577
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

01:30:33.742 --> 01:30:35.585
Okay, we're changing direction.

01:30:35.744 --> 01:30:37.484
We're heading over that way.

01:30:37.646 --> 01:30:40.854
Eightball's gonna go over there
and see can he find a way through.

01:30:41.350 --> 01:30:43.762
- Got it?
- Got it.

01:30:44.453 --> 01:30:47.456
Eightball, let's dance.

01:30:48.023 --> 01:30:50.332
Put a nigger behind the trigger.

01:31:51.420 --> 01:31:52.955
Fuck.

01:32:08.670 --> 01:32:10.080
Cease fire.

01:32:10.239 --> 01:32:12.150
Cease fire, goddamn it.

01:32:12.307 --> 01:32:14.844
Cool it, goddamn it. Cool it. Cease fire.

01:32:15.010 --> 01:32:16.545
- Hold it.
- Cease fire.

01:32:16.712 --> 01:32:17.952
- Cease fire.
- Cease fire.

01:32:18.113 --> 01:32:21.651
Okay, listen up. Did anybody see a sniper?
Did anybody see anything?

01:32:21.817 --> 01:32:23.489
Anybody see a sniper?

01:32:23.652 --> 01:32:25.153
- Nothing.
- Negative.

01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:29.233
Okay, then save your ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you.

01:32:30.158 --> 01:32:31.329
Eightball.

01:32:31.493 --> 01:32:34.098
No, no. Cease fire. Cease fire.

01:32:34.263 --> 01:32:35.969
Animal, cease fire.

01:32:36.131 --> 01:32:38.270
Cowboy, it's Sergeant Murphy.

01:32:38.433 --> 01:32:39.912
This is Cowboy. Over.

01:32:40.068 --> 01:32:43.538
This is Murphy.
What is your present position? Over.

01:32:43.705 --> 01:32:46.014
Murph, we're receiving enemy sniper fire.

01:32:46.174 --> 01:32:47.448
Eightball is down.

01:32:47.609 --> 01:32:50.521
Our position is about half a klick
north of Checkpoint Four.

01:32:50.679 --> 01:32:54.388
Believe possible strong enemy forces
occupying buildings in front of us.

01:32:54.549 --> 01:32:58.053
Request immediate tank support. Over.

01:32:58.553 --> 01:32:59.963
Roger. Understand.

01:33:00.122 --> 01:33:02.625
I'll see what I can do. Over.

01:33:02.791 --> 01:33:05.168
Roger. Over and out.

01:33:05.327 --> 01:33:07.636
- Stay close.
- Got it.

01:33:08.263 --> 01:33:12.302
Okay, listen up.
I think we're being set up for an ambush.

01:33:12.467 --> 01:33:16.039
I think there may be strong enemy forces
in those buildings over there.

01:33:16.204 --> 01:33:18.081
I've requested tank support.

01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:21.516
We're gonna sit tight till it comes,
but keep your eyes open.

01:33:21.677 --> 01:33:25.716
If they decide to hit us,
we'll have to pull back fast.

01:33:26.748 --> 01:33:29.490
Goddamn it. Halt.
Cease your fire, Mother.

01:33:29.651 --> 01:33:31.562
- Cease your fucking fire.
- Cowboy.

01:33:31.720 --> 01:33:33.494
- What?
- We can't leave him out there.

01:33:33.655 --> 01:33:36.431
We're not leaving him,
we'll get him when the tank comes up.

01:33:36.591 --> 01:33:39.264
He's hit three fucking times.
He can't wait that long.

01:33:39.428 --> 01:33:41.464
I seen this before.

01:33:41.630 --> 01:33:44.872
That sniper's just trying to suck us in,
one at a time.

01:33:46.735 --> 01:33:49.909
Goddamn it. No.

01:33:50.072 --> 01:33:53.018
- Goddamn it, cease fire. Cease fire.
- Man, fuck this...

01:33:53.175 --> 01:33:55.279
Fuck this shit.
I'm going in to bring him out.

01:33:55.444 --> 01:33:59.016
- No, you sit the fuck down, goddamn it.
- Cover me.

01:34:14.930 --> 01:34:19.435
Cease fire, he's there.
Cease fire, he's there.

01:34:19.601 --> 01:34:21.876
Cease fire.

01:34:33.248 --> 01:34:34.556
Hold your fire.

01:34:34.716 --> 01:34:36.752
Hold your fire.

01:34:36.918 --> 01:34:39.421
Cease fire, you can't see the sniper.

01:34:39.588 --> 01:34:43.968
Save the ammo.
Nobody fire till I tell you. Nobody.

01:34:49.398 --> 01:34:51.207
Hold your fire.

01:34:51.900 --> 01:34:54.380
What the fuck do we do now, Cowboy?

01:34:55.637 --> 01:34:57.639
Give me that fucking radio.

01:35:01.843 --> 01:35:04.448
Murph? This is Cowboy. Over.

01:35:04.613 --> 01:35:06.092
This is Murphy. Over.

01:35:06.248 --> 01:35:08.625
Murph, we're in some deep shit.
I got two men down.

01:35:08.817 --> 01:35:11.729
What's the story
on that fucking tank? Over.

01:35:12.788 --> 01:35:16.258
Sorry, Cowboy.
No luck so far with the tank.

01:35:16.425 --> 01:35:18.700
Will advise. Over.

01:35:19.694 --> 01:35:21.673
Roger. Out.

01:35:22.063 --> 01:35:24.372
Numb-nut bastards.

01:35:24.533 --> 01:35:27.639
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

01:35:28.503 --> 01:35:30.573
Can't afford to wait for the tank.

01:35:30.739 --> 01:35:32.684
I think they're gonna hit us any minute.

01:35:32.841 --> 01:35:35.048
When they do,
we won't have time to pull out.

01:35:35.210 --> 01:35:38.190
We gotta do it now.
Let's get ready to move.

01:35:38.346 --> 01:35:40.621
- Ready to pull out.
- Wait a minute. Hold it.

01:35:40.949 --> 01:35:44.828
Hold it, nobody's pulling out.
There's only one sniper there.

01:35:44.986 --> 01:35:46.260
Back off, Mother.

01:35:46.421 --> 01:35:49.401
I'm calling the plays.
I say we're pulling out.

01:35:49.558 --> 01:35:51.367
Well, what about Doc Jay and Eightball?

01:35:51.526 --> 01:35:55.337
I know it's a shitty thing to do,
but we can't refuse to accept the situation.

01:35:55.497 --> 01:35:57.772
We're not leaving
Doc Jay and Eightball out there.

01:35:57.933 --> 01:35:59.776
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

01:35:59.935 --> 01:36:02.677
- You know that.
- Bullshit. Come on, you guys.

01:36:02.838 --> 01:36:05.318
We gotta bring them back.
Let's get them, let's do it.

01:36:05.474 --> 01:36:07.851
Stand down, Mother.
That's a direct order.

01:36:12.047 --> 01:36:16.188
Fuck you, Cowboy.
Fuck all you assholes.

01:36:18.286 --> 01:36:21.323
- Goddamn it.
- Fucking son of a bitch.

01:36:21.490 --> 01:36:24.197
You motherfucker.

01:36:39.841 --> 01:36:42.583
Doc. Doc. Doc.

01:36:44.412 --> 01:36:46.357
Where's the sniper?

01:36:49.317 --> 01:36:52.491
Doc, where's the sniper?

01:37:01.196 --> 01:37:02.936
Shit.

01:37:04.533 --> 01:37:07.070
Shit. Fuck.

01:37:21.383 --> 01:37:22.987
Fuck.

01:37:54.649 --> 01:37:56.788
Hey, Cowboy.

01:37:57.118 --> 01:37:58.892
Yeah?

01:37:59.754 --> 01:38:03.258
Doc Jay and Eightball are wasted.

01:38:03.858 --> 01:38:07.362
There's only one sniper, nothing else.

01:38:07.729 --> 01:38:11.608
Move up the squad,
you're clear up to here.

01:38:12.434 --> 01:38:13.913
Come on.

01:38:16.538 --> 01:38:18.745
Son of a bitch.

01:38:22.510 --> 01:38:25.081
- Okay, listen up.
- Listen up.

01:38:26.114 --> 01:38:30.357
No-Doze, Stutten, Donlon, Rock,
you come with me, we'll take a look.

01:38:30.785 --> 01:38:33.197
The rest of you all stay put
and cover our ass.

01:38:33.355 --> 01:38:36.165
We may be coming back in a big hurry.

01:38:37.025 --> 01:38:39.368
- I'm going with you.
- I'm coming too.

01:38:39.527 --> 01:38:41.370
Okay.

01:38:41.529 --> 01:38:43.201
- You all set?
- Yeah.

01:38:43.365 --> 01:38:44.400
Let's move out.

01:38:44.666 --> 01:38:45.837
Let's do it.

01:39:24.039 --> 01:39:25.381
Hey, Cowboy.

01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.043
Top of the black building,
around the corner.

01:39:47.796 --> 01:39:50.503
Donlon, give me that radio.

01:39:53.034 --> 01:39:54.774
Murphy, this is Cowboy. Over.

01:40:05.280 --> 01:40:07.692
- Cowboy.
- Holy shit. That sniper's got a clean shot.

01:40:07.849 --> 01:40:09.760
Get him the fuck out of here.

01:40:16.458 --> 01:40:19.165
- I ain't got a first aid.
- I don't believe this shit.

01:40:19.327 --> 01:40:21.466
- Give me your hand.
- Shut up.

01:40:21.629 --> 01:40:23.233
- Take it easy, Cowboy.
- Don't move.

01:40:23.398 --> 01:40:24.706
- Shit.
- That son of a bitch.

01:40:24.866 --> 01:40:26.743
- You'll be all right.
- You're going home.

01:40:26.901 --> 01:40:29.745
- Shut up.
- Don't shit me.

01:40:29.904 --> 01:40:33.544
You know I'm not gonna shit you, man.
You're my favorite turd.

01:40:34.175 --> 01:40:35.381
Come on. Easy.

01:40:35.777 --> 01:40:36.914
Here you go.

01:40:38.613 --> 01:40:42.526
- Cowboy.
- Hang on, man. Hang on.

01:40:46.354 --> 01:40:49.391
I can hack it. I can hack it.

01:40:55.463 --> 01:40:58.910
- I can hack it.
- You can hack it, man.

01:41:54.956 --> 01:41:57.527
Let's go get some payback.

01:42:03.431 --> 01:42:05.035
Okay.

01:42:11.172 --> 01:42:12.912
Okay.

01:42:20.348 --> 01:42:22.452
Watch that fucking hole.

01:42:23.718 --> 01:42:24.958
Throw some smoke.

01:42:41.469 --> 01:42:43.278
Okay, ready?

01:43:24.279 --> 01:43:28.022
Donlon, Rock, that way.
You two, with me.

01:43:33.087 --> 01:43:35.760
Joker, in there. New guy.

01:45:39.747 --> 01:45:42.693
We got the sniper.

01:46:16.384 --> 01:46:17.919
Joker?

01:46:18.453 --> 01:46:19.954
Yo.

01:46:20.288 --> 01:46:21.858
What's up?

01:46:23.324 --> 01:46:25.497
We got the sniper.

01:46:38.039 --> 01:46:40.018
I saved Joker's ass.

01:46:40.174 --> 01:46:41.983
I got the sniper.

01:46:42.143 --> 01:46:44.816
I fucking blew her away.

01:46:45.646 --> 01:46:47.625
Am I bad?

01:46:48.216 --> 01:46:52.220
Am I a life-taker? Am I a heartbreaker?

01:47:09.770 --> 01:47:11.943
What's she saying?

01:47:15.576 --> 01:47:17.419
She's praying.

01:47:21.282 --> 01:47:24.592
No more boom-boom for this baby-san.

01:47:27.488 --> 01:47:29.934
There's nothing we can do for her.

01:47:31.492 --> 01:47:33.596
She's dead meat.

01:47:38.065 --> 01:47:39.509
Okay.

01:47:40.801 --> 01:47:42.974
Let's get the fuck out of here.

01:47:47.475 --> 01:47:49.352
What about her?

01:47:53.114 --> 01:47:54.786
Fuck her.

01:47:56.117 --> 01:47:57.823
Let her rot.

01:48:14.135 --> 01:48:16.478
We can't just leave her here.

01:48:19.674 --> 01:48:21.585
Hey, asshole.

01:48:22.043 --> 01:48:24.284
Cowboy's wasted.

01:48:24.745 --> 01:48:27.316
You're fresh out of friends.

01:48:28.416 --> 01:48:30.259
I'm running this squad now...

01:48:30.418 --> 01:48:34.696
...and I say we leave the gook
for the mother-loving rats.

01:48:38.526 --> 01:48:41.597
I'm not trying to run this squad.

01:48:43.431 --> 01:48:47.401
I'm just saying
we can't leave her like this.

01:48:56.911 --> 01:48:59.891
Shoot me.

01:49:01.816 --> 01:49:03.852
Shoot...

01:49:04.352 --> 01:49:05.956
...me.

01:49:06.520 --> 01:49:08.624
Shoot...

01:49:09.123 --> 01:49:10.727
...me.

01:49:11.192 --> 01:49:13.194
Shoot.

01:49:14.862 --> 01:49:16.568
Shoot.

01:49:17.765 --> 01:49:21.075
If you wanna waste her, go on...

01:49:22.937 --> 01:49:25.041
...waste her.

01:49:25.206 --> 01:49:26.844
Shoot...

01:49:29.010 --> 01:49:30.454
...me.

01:49:34.548 --> 01:49:37.324
Shoot me.

01:49:39.253 --> 01:49:40.493
Shoot...

01:49:41.756 --> 01:49:43.496
...me.

01:49:43.858 --> 01:49:45.962
Shoot...

01:49:46.661 --> 01:49:48.105
...me.

01:49:48.696 --> 01:49:50.903
Shoot.

01:49:52.533 --> 01:49:54.569
Shoot.

01:49:58.205 --> 01:49:59.740
Shoot.

01:50:00.741 --> 01:50:02.345
Shoot.

01:50:39.647 --> 01:50:41.490
Joker...

01:50:41.649 --> 01:50:46.427
...we're gonna have to put you up
for the Congressional Medal of Ugly.

01:50:50.191 --> 01:50:52.330
Hard-core, man.

01:50:54.328 --> 01:50:56.865
Fucking hard-core.

01:51:13.848 --> 01:51:18.922
We have nailed our names
in the pages of history enough for today.

01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:24.196
We hump down to the Perfume River
to set in for the night.

01:52:02.730 --> 01:52:06.939
My thoughts drift back
to erect-nipple wet dreams...

01:52:07.101 --> 01:52:13.244
...about Mary Jane Rottencrotch
and the great homecoming-fuck fantasy.

01:52:13.874 --> 01:52:16.581
I am so happy that I am alive...

01:52:16.744 --> 01:52:20.282
...in one piece and short.

01:52:20.948 --> 01:52:24.258
I am in a world of shit, yes...

01:52:24.418 --> 01:52:26.397
...but I am alive.

01:52:26.787 --> 01:52:28.789
And I am not afraid.
