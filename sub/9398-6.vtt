00:00.055 --> 00:01.456
<i>Previously, on One Tree Hill...</i>

00:01.466 --> 00:02.675
I guess I was wrong.

00:02.685 --> 00:04.550
I'm not the guy for you, Brooke Davis.

00:04.560 --> 00:07.715
I traded the car for the bike and I made 200 bucks.

00:07.786 --> 00:09.588
Your Mum wants you back in the team.

00:09.598 --> 00:11.670
You have to stay on your medication

00:11.680 --> 00:13.341
and we limit you to 15 minutes a night.

00:13.351 --> 00:14.438
A full scolarship.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.193
Tell coach K, I won't let him down.

00:16.206 --> 00:17.790
Haley! I'm going to Duke.

00:17.803 --> 00:19.243
I'm pregnant.

00:19.418 --> 00:20.589
You're gonna be okay.

00:20.591 --> 00:23.020
I think my dead uncle saved my life.

00:23.039 --> 00:25.103
I killed my brother.

00:25.348 --> 00:28.460
He's a part-time model.
You're a 22 years old fashion designer.

00:28.476 --> 00:30.070
- Named Peyton.
- Very funny.

00:30.085 --> 00:32.110
- Hi.
- Hi, I'm...

00:32.125 --> 00:33.392
Peyton.

00:33.765 --> 00:36.212
Look, I just have a very bad
feeling about this guy.

00:36.225 --> 00:37.651
Leave me alone!

00:37.668 --> 00:38.421
My God!

00:38.435 --> 00:40.922
Don't you know we're supposed
to be together?

00:43.035 --> 00:45.513
- Who the hell are you?
- I'm her brother, bitch.

00:49.496 --> 00:52.603
<i>Life comes at us from
out of the darkness...</i>

00:54.998 --> 00:56.273
Peyton!

00:57.568 --> 00:58.863
Peyton!

01:00.000 --> 01:06.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:09.678 --> 01:13.322
<i>And at times, we can struggle to find
the courage to face it.</i>

01:15.357 --> 01:17.681
Thanks for almost braining me with the keys.

01:17.696 --> 01:21.272
Wow... It's bright.

01:21.636 --> 01:24.620
Yeah, well...
With psycho Derek still out there,

01:24.637 --> 01:27.670
I really haven't been
able to sleep for 48 hours.

01:27.965 --> 01:31.112
I thought maybe I'd try to
paint the shadows away...

01:33.177 --> 01:35.133
Can't you talk to your mom?

01:35.158 --> 01:36.150
Maybe she can help.

01:36.168 --> 01:37.361
Come on, Hales, you see my mom.

01:37.375 --> 01:39.693
She can't even help herself right now.

01:40.016 --> 01:42.360
I hate to say it,
but what about your Dad?

01:42.378 --> 01:44.620
Hales, I know that we're in trouble
financially right now,

01:44.637 --> 01:46.391
but, I'm gonna take care of it,
I promise.

01:46.408 --> 01:48.243
As soon as the basketball season ends,
I'm gonna get a job,

01:48.256 --> 01:50.280
but I'm not gonna go to my Dad for this.

01:50.297 --> 01:53.492
Okay, I'm sorry, it's just...
We're gonna have a family soon,

01:53.507 --> 01:55.962
and I guess I just need
that guy from the press conference

01:55.976 --> 01:58.161
to tell me everything's
gonna be okay again.

01:58.177 --> 01:59.252
It will.

01:59.265 --> 02:02.323
Oh, and I know that we're eventually
(hit*) to get a car,

02:02.338 --> 02:04.343
so I figured until then...

02:04.478 --> 02:05.601
You could ride with me.

02:05.617 --> 02:07.643
I know you don't expect me to wear this.

02:07.657 --> 02:09.461
Come on, it's so "Garden State".

02:09.475 --> 02:12.342
Besides, you were the one that needed
a helmet to ride the motorcycle...

02:13.617 --> 02:15.393
Hey! Hey!

02:15.425 --> 02:16.853
No...

02:20.345 --> 02:22.011
- Hey.
- Hey, girl.

02:22.026 --> 02:25.213
You are a full-on genius

02:25.226 --> 02:26.791
I don't know why you even doubt me.

02:26.808 --> 02:28.322
Just bow down to the master.

02:28.338 --> 02:32.220
Oh, I'm bowing.
I am so crushed out on model boy,

02:32.236 --> 02:34.140
or should I say model man?

02:34.155 --> 02:35.750
You like?

02:35.767 --> 02:38.802
Real cultured Tiffany's.
Courtesy of Nick.

02:38.815 --> 02:41.980
So, I'm thinking you might be over Lucas,
right about now.

02:41.995 --> 02:45.293
Well, let's see the last thing Lucas
gave me was a mix-tape.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.942
Mix-tape, earings,
mix-tape, earings.

02:47.958 --> 02:50.173
I totally owe you one.

02:52.207 --> 02:55.551
Well, take your seats,
I'm your new english teacher, Mr Chavez.

02:57.328 --> 02:58.580
Nick?

02:58.598 --> 02:59.911
Peyton?

02:59.926 --> 03:01.522
Here.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.533
I have to go to the nurse,
I'm gonna be sick.

03:48.998 --> 03:51.540
This is all your fault!

03:51.555 --> 03:53.761
Well? You skanked me into this,

03:53.776 --> 03:54.892
how about you help me out?

03:54.908 --> 03:57.173
Hey, I am not the one
that ditch my boyfriend

03:57.186 --> 03:59.541
to have my (horn trimmed)
by her highschool english teacher.

03:59.755 --> 04:01.832
Although, I am kind of jealous.

04:01.845 --> 04:04.092
Thank you.  That is very constructive.

04:04.105 --> 04:05.861
What am I supposed to do about it now, genius?

04:05.876 --> 04:07.750
I have to see him every day
until I'm graduate.

04:07.766 --> 04:09.643
- This is so embarrassing.
- Look...

04:09.655 --> 04:12.801
He's probably just as embarassed
about the situation as you are.

04:13.968 --> 04:17.161
Okay, maybe not that embarassed, but,
bottom line Brooke, you have to deal with him.

04:17.176 --> 04:18.553
Deal with him? Deal with him how?

04:18.565 --> 04:19.861
Car crash? Drowning?
What do you suggest?

04:19.875 --> 04:21.753
Look, why don't you just wait
until school is over

04:21.766 --> 04:23.520
that way you can talk
to him alone.

04:23.538 --> 04:25.092
I mean, you can't skip school forever.

04:25.108 --> 04:26.473
Oh really? Says who?

04:26.485 --> 04:30.363
Why do I need stupid english
for... any...how..?

04:35.165 --> 04:36.521
Okay.

04:36.675 --> 04:38.903
Would you do me a favor
and check the hallway

04:38.917 --> 04:40.971
to make sure the coast is clear?

04:49.048 --> 04:52.150
Actually...
You might wanna wait a second.

04:52.165 --> 04:55.513
Are we expecting an outbreak
of stalkers and photographers

04:55.527 --> 04:57.910
or you're just ashamed
of being seen with me?

04:57.928 --> 05:00.470
No... Everybody knows.

05:00.486 --> 05:03.032
I guess bad news travel fast.

05:03.046 --> 05:05.152
Are you gonna be okay?

05:05.166 --> 05:08.022
Every time I close my eyes,
I see him there, watching me,

05:08.038 --> 05:09.542
and now, I gotta come to school
and deal with

05:09.558 --> 05:11.243
all of them watching me?

05:11.556 --> 05:12.932
Did you try calling your Dad?

05:12.945 --> 05:14.413
No!

05:14.856 --> 05:17.230
Look, I know he will come home
the minute I call

05:17.247 --> 05:19.330
but what's the point, okay?
It's over.

05:19.345 --> 05:21.050
And there's probably like hundred
Police officers

05:21.067 --> 05:22.553
out there looking for psycho Derek,

05:22.566 --> 05:25.092
so, what's my Dad gonna do?

05:25.108 --> 05:26.903
Protect you.

05:27.337 --> 05:30.103
- I can take care of myself.
- Eh, I know that.

05:30.116 --> 05:32.072
But it's okay to be afraid
from time to time.

05:32.085 --> 05:33.512
Really?

05:33.527 --> 05:35.492
What are you afraid of?

05:36.538 --> 05:39.953
This morning, I ask Withey
if I could play again.

05:40.066 --> 05:42.460
- That's great, Luke.
- Yeah.

05:42.477 --> 05:46.463
But with my heart condition, it still doesn't
change the fact that it's scary.

05:46.478 --> 05:48.572
Well, then, why are you playing?

05:48.586 --> 05:50.553
Because it's who I am.

05:50.738 --> 05:54.573
And you need to be who you are.

06:01.297 --> 06:02.773
I'm out of here.

06:03.735 --> 06:07.552
Wait! Peyton...
If you let this change you...

06:08.346 --> 06:10.333
He wins.

06:10.528 --> 06:12.771
Maybe he wins.

06:18.588 --> 06:20.080
- Gigi.
- Mouth!

06:20.096 --> 06:21.552
- I was just thinking about you.
- Good.

06:21.568 --> 06:22.791
You know, now that
we're in the playhouse,

06:22.805 --> 06:25.193
we got to step up our game
for the webcast.

06:25.206 --> 06:27.330
I'm gonna ask you out.

06:27.507 --> 06:29.860
Did you just ask me out?

06:29.875 --> 06:31.081
Like on a date?

06:31.096 --> 06:34.272
No, not yet, but...
I'm going to.

06:34.288 --> 06:36.340
I just wanted to let you know.

06:45.976 --> 06:47.920
What do we got here?

06:47.935 --> 06:50.711
The Ravens star riding the bus.

06:50.728 --> 06:52.862
Someone wants to talk to you.

06:56.785 --> 06:58.373
You know me?

06:59.168 --> 07:00.942
I know you.

07:00.956 --> 07:05.502
Nathan Scott. Tree Hill's best
power forward in 15 years.

07:05.515 --> 07:07.170
You have at least 28 points a game.

07:07.188 --> 07:09.870
You just recording your fourteenth
triple-double this year.

07:09.871 --> 07:13.071
That, plus a *** jumpshot who
put your old man ashamed.

07:13.695 --> 07:15.761
How am I doing so far?

07:15.775 --> 07:17.490
Pretty good.

07:17.503 --> 07:18.923
Daunte Jones.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.609
Hey.

07:21.431 --> 07:23.400
How come you're not signing with Duke?

07:23.419 --> 07:25.251
I never say I wasn't.

07:25.265 --> 07:27.071
Good answer.

07:27.086 --> 07:30.751
More important question is...
Are we going to state?

07:31.316 --> 07:33.313
You can bet on it.

07:35.005 --> 07:36.991
I just might.

07:39.405 --> 07:42.592
- You want a ride?
- No, i'm good, thanks.

07:42.605 --> 07:44.713
All right, suit yourself.

07:44.725 --> 07:47.292
Let me give you some advice.

07:47.855 --> 07:50.110
Win State and go to Duke.

07:50.128 --> 07:53.423
This town has been waiting
a long time for a state title.

07:53.558 --> 07:55.771
Too long.

07:58.706 --> 08:00.900
Take care of that knee.

08:21.286 --> 08:24.691
If you're not gonna coach, at least
you could mentor the kid a little.

08:24.706 --> 08:28.802
It's a full ride to Duke. It's something
he's been working for all his life.

08:29.255 --> 08:31.781
I made that mistake with you.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.691
I'm not gonna make it with Nathan.

08:34.707 --> 08:37.210
Now, if you'll excuse me...

08:37.227 --> 08:40.753
I have a state championship to win.

08:43.817 --> 08:47.173
What do you know
about the art on my office wall?

08:48.837 --> 08:52.850
"And he said, what hast thou done?

08:52.865 --> 08:58.650
The voice of thy brother's blood
crieth unto me from the ground".

08:58.706 --> 09:01.001
Ca?n and Abel, Danny.

09:01.015 --> 09:03.420
I know my Bible.

09:04.205 --> 09:06.412
The question is...

09:06.425 --> 09:09.283
What's it doing on your wall?

09:09.295 --> 09:11.213
Probably a prank.

09:11.226 --> 09:13.040
It seems someone thinks I mistreated Keith

09:13.057 --> 09:14.391
while he was alive.

09:14.407 --> 09:17.571
We all have to tone for our sins.

09:17.586 --> 09:19.371
What that's supposed to mean?

09:19.387 --> 09:23.702
It means Judgement Day
is waiting for us all.

09:28.025 --> 09:30.640
It's a good thing you pray, Whitey.

09:38.438 --> 09:40.170
What are you doing?

09:40.186 --> 09:42.231
Just praying he won't kill me.

09:42.246 --> 09:44.641
How does he look?
Does he look mad?

09:46.776 --> 09:49.433
Yes. But in a hot way.

09:49.446 --> 09:50.812
Maybe I should talk to him for you.

09:50.828 --> 09:52.392
Would you? Thanks.

09:53.775 --> 09:55.853
Not so fast.

09:55.975 --> 09:59.591
All right, look, I sort of have
a lot of experience in this.

09:59.658 --> 10:01.471
He's gonna say you should
have never lied to him,

10:01.486 --> 10:03.590
and that it can't work
cause of the age difference,

10:03.606 --> 10:06.683
then he's gonna say there's no way you two
can be together because he's your teacher.

10:06.686 --> 10:09.752
And then he's gonna yell a lot.
But then it will be over.

10:09.766 --> 10:12.811
Just remember,
if he gets really mad, start crying.

10:12.828 --> 10:14.541
It works every time.

10:14.556 --> 10:16.570
See you in the quad.
Good luck.

10:19.118 --> 10:20.741
Hi.

10:21.156 --> 10:22.871
Brooke Davis...

10:23.238 --> 10:25.582
18, highschool student.

10:31.696 --> 10:35.520
Okay... I know, I'm sorry.

10:35.976 --> 10:40.232
I should have told you the truth
about how old I am and who I am but...

10:40.245 --> 10:42.351
We met and we went out and I liked you.

10:42.365 --> 10:43.703
I just didn't know...

10:48.067 --> 10:49.881
You shouldn't have lied.

10:49.896 --> 10:51.360
I know.

10:51.635 --> 10:54.083
We really can't do this, right?

10:54.848 --> 10:56.311
Right.

11:06.007 --> 11:07.740
You said you were 23.

11:07.858 --> 11:10.140
- You said you were a model.
- Part-time, but full-time,

11:10.156 --> 11:12.710
I'm your teacher so, we really can't do this.

11:14.018 --> 11:15.881
Absolutely not.

11:16.635 --> 11:19.410
But, if we were to do this...

11:19.648 --> 11:21.702
We'll have to make sure
that no one knows.

11:21.728 --> 11:22.752
No one.

11:22.766 --> 11:24.531
Not a soul.

11:24.548 --> 11:27.261
If, we were to do this.

11:29.145 --> 11:31.071
I won't tell if you want.

11:31.086 --> 11:32.512
Done.

11:40.196 --> 11:42.382
Look who are all up in my house, dog.

11:42.397 --> 11:45.820
Oh my God, you have one decent game
and all of a sudden it's your house.

11:45.835 --> 11:48.420
I heard a rumor you might
be coming of the banch into playoff.

11:48.437 --> 11:49.791
Eh, is that true, Luke?

11:49.807 --> 11:51.371
It's true my friends.

11:51.385 --> 11:52.951
I'm back.

11:53.466 --> 11:54.782
Okay.

11:54.797 --> 11:56.922
Me and my boy back together again.

11:56.935 --> 11:58.972
40 minutes a night,
in the big time.

11:58.986 --> 12:00.880
Actually, Whitey only give me 15 minutes
a game, you know,

12:00.897 --> 12:02.793
due to my heart condition.

12:05.497 --> 12:07.133
So...

12:07.636 --> 12:10.052
I guess you'll be
wanting this back.

12:14.817 --> 12:16.890
Since you started this year
with it, you keep it.

12:16.906 --> 12:18.871
- You're sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

12:18.887 --> 12:20.381
Cool.

12:20.528 --> 12:23.301
All right, look, game in 21.

12:23.315 --> 12:24.953
Make it, take it.

12:25.205 --> 12:28.003
In your case,
Mr 15 minutes man,

12:28.425 --> 12:30.341
we're going to make
the game 11.

12:30.358 --> 12:31.871
All right.

12:51.796 --> 12:53.382
Mouth, what are you doing?

12:54.636 --> 12:56.312
Gigi wants to go out with me.

12:56.326 --> 12:57.910
Gigi's cute.

12:58.048 --> 12:59.960
Well, I don't really think about
her in that way.

12:59.978 --> 13:02.250
I mean, I really
don't even know her, but...

13:02.267 --> 13:04.261
I don't want to heart her feelings.

13:04.296 --> 13:06.121
What should I do?

13:06.288 --> 13:09.301
Oh, I'm not the relationship
expert this days, trust me.

13:09.318 --> 13:12.713
But, you're smart, Mouth,
you'll figure it out.

13:12.726 --> 13:15.193
And 'ever you do, just be nice.

13:24.317 --> 13:25.572
So?

13:26.885 --> 13:29.030
You were right, it was...

13:29.165 --> 13:31.483
Really intense.

13:31.685 --> 13:33.391
So it's over?

13:35.088 --> 13:36.973
Yeah, it's over.

13:42.896 --> 13:44.910
It's over the limit?

13:45.898 --> 13:48.242
Are you sure?
Can you just check again?

13:50.106 --> 13:51.402
Yeah.

13:51.546 --> 13:52.712
Okay.

13:52.726 --> 13:55.340
No, yeah. thanks.

13:55.645 --> 13:57.001
Everything okay?

13:57.015 --> 13:59.591
I tried to use our credit card
this morning and it was denied.

13:59.605 --> 14:02.593
And now the card compagny's telling
me we're over our limit.

14:02.606 --> 14:04.600
Have you talked about this with Nathan?

14:04.616 --> 14:08.272
Sort of, but he, he just says
everything is gonna be okay.

14:08.285 --> 14:10.362
Karen,
If we can't make ends meet now,

14:10.376 --> 14:12.100
what are we gonna
do when the baby comes?

14:12.118 --> 14:14.143
Okay, all right, let's not panic.

14:14.155 --> 14:16.993
You know, if it's more else working,
I can help you out with that.

14:17.005 --> 14:19.960
You know, mornings before school
or nights, whatever.

14:19.977 --> 14:21.763
Yeah, okay.

14:22.218 --> 14:24.830
If you need a short lean on or someone to talk to,

14:24.846 --> 14:26.990
I can help you with that too.

14:27.146 --> 14:31.280
After all, I am the expert
on teenage pregnancy.

14:42.578 --> 14:44.922
Pretty dark, don't you think?

14:45.086 --> 14:46.530
I love you, Luke.

14:46.545 --> 14:48.611
But I've chosen darkness.

14:48.805 --> 14:52.121
Well, I just want to
come check up on you, girly.

14:52.225 --> 14:53.952
How's your head?

14:54.197 --> 14:56.211
Is that me...

14:56.516 --> 14:59.213
Or I'm the reason people always leave?

14:59.695 --> 15:03.760
Or I'm the reason all
this things keep hapening to me?

15:03.895 --> 15:06.603
Maybe I'm just destined to be alone.

15:06.616 --> 15:08.152
It's not you.

15:08.167 --> 15:10.242
And you're not alone.

15:11.735 --> 15:14.380
But eventually you gonna have to be.

15:15.555 --> 15:17.302
No, you're right, I can do it.

15:17.315 --> 15:18.300
All right.

15:18.316 --> 15:21.722
But just in case,
you have a key to my place,

15:21.935 --> 15:24.523
and I'm just a phone call away.

15:28.607 --> 15:30.080
Thanks.

15:47.875 --> 15:49.531
Where are you going?

15:52.486 --> 15:55.621
I just need to get a workout
so I'm going for a run.

15:55.636 --> 15:58.652
You're gonna have to run
a marathon to take care of that ass.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.392
- Hey.
- Hi.

16:32.247 --> 16:34.551
I'm sorry. I tried.

16:41.397 --> 16:43.601
Have you talked to your brother?

16:46.077 --> 16:48.770
He won't call me back.

16:48.835 --> 16:51.580
He's like a Marine or something.

16:54.145 --> 16:56.242
Can I stay?

16:59.888 --> 17:01.533
Sure.

17:24.247 --> 17:26.272
Good thing to deal with an old friend.

17:26.285 --> 17:29.383
Seems he wasn't aware that our star
forward had a pregnant wife.

17:29.397 --> 17:30.793
Yeah, when he heard
about your situation,

17:30.805 --> 17:32.692
he was happy to take
your bike back in trade.

17:32.705 --> 17:35.033
Thanks, but I can't
accept this from you.

17:35.045 --> 17:36.221
NCAA rules.

17:36.236 --> 17:37.561
Nathan, it's your car.

17:37.578 --> 17:39.701
There's no money
changing hands here.

17:39.715 --> 17:42.603
Just consider this the Tree Hill
alumni lending an helping hand.

17:42.616 --> 17:45.601
It's what you're calling yourself
these days, alumni?

17:46.226 --> 17:49.970
Why do you go ruin a perfectly
good gesture by making me feel bad?

17:50.146 --> 17:51.932
Just take the car.

17:52.327 --> 17:54.552
What am I gonna do
with that piece of crap?

17:55.338 --> 17:59.021
You know, Nate... as Ravens guys,
stick together.

18:01.957 --> 18:03.643
Daunte...

18:07.057 --> 18:08.452
Thanks.

18:26.877 --> 18:29.713
I love working for Uncle Sam!

18:29.727 --> 18:32.893
I love working for Uncle Sam!

18:32.906 --> 18:36.121
Let's my know just who I am.

18:36.136 --> 18:39.293
Let's my know just who I am.

18:39.307 --> 18:40.672
One, two, three, four...

18:40.685 --> 18:42.400
One, two, three...

18:50.745 --> 18:52.582
Left face!

18:53.295 --> 18:55.971
Strauss, continue the run please!

18:58.495 --> 18:59.723
I tried to call you.

18:59.737 --> 19:01.181
I know.

19:01.196 --> 19:04.312
Look, it's Peyton.
She's not doing well.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.342
And remind me why this is my concern?

19:06.356 --> 19:07.460
She's your sister.

19:07.475 --> 19:08.733
I don't even know her.

19:08.745 --> 19:11.351
And to be honest,
if this introduction was any indication

19:11.368 --> 19:13.242
of what her side of
the family might be like,

19:13.256 --> 19:14.803
I'll pass.

19:14.965 --> 19:17.150
Look, with Ellie gone, you're the only
family she's got.

19:17.168 --> 19:19.000
Look around you, Scott.

19:19.016 --> 19:21.942
We deal with some pretty
serious situations here.

19:21.958 --> 19:23.920
Life threatening type situations, so...

19:23.938 --> 19:26.602
You'll have to excuse me if I don't have time

19:26.616 --> 19:28.330
for your highschool dramas.

19:28.347 --> 19:29.951
Come on, man!

19:29.967 --> 19:31.973
She needs your help.

19:32.275 --> 19:33.901
I need your help.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.983
When I started my first tour overseas,

19:35.997 --> 19:38.633
I made it a point to get to know
all the guys in my unit

19:38.646 --> 19:41.071
because they also needed help.

19:41.086 --> 19:43.312
But, it's a war

19:43.325 --> 19:45.290
and people die.

19:45.715 --> 19:49.901
So, after a while, I learned to
stop getting to know the new guys.

19:49.917 --> 19:51.883
It was just easier that way.

19:51.898 --> 19:53.823
Sorry you made the trip...

19:53.836 --> 19:55.253
But I can't help you.

19:55.266 --> 19:59.000
You travel half way around the world
to fight for a complete stranger...

19:59.728 --> 20:03.742
but you don't have it in your heart
to fight for your own flesh and blood.

20:16.255 --> 20:17.710
Hey, sorry.

20:17.727 --> 20:19.493
Haley, you're late.
And where is Peyton?

20:19.508 --> 20:21.411
I know, I'm sorry
I had to close up the cafe.

20:21.428 --> 20:22.753
Peyton didn't even come to school today.

20:22.765 --> 20:24.190
I think cheerleading
is out of question.

20:24.207 --> 20:27.342
Well, she lets one little stalker into her
life, and we all get screwed, that's nice.

20:27.356 --> 20:29.951
Brooke, some of us actually
have real problems.

20:29.966 --> 20:31.432
Fine.

20:32.485 --> 20:34.062
How is she doing?

20:34.078 --> 20:35.552
Honestly, I don't think,
she's doing that well,

20:35.565 --> 20:37.750
and it would kind of
be nice if you knew that.

20:37.895 --> 20:41.390
Correct me if I'm wrong, but didn't you
guys used to be like best friends?

20:41.408 --> 20:43.630
- What are you gonna do with this?
- Don't ask me, okay?

20:43.647 --> 20:45.573
I'm not the bitch who started it.

20:45.588 --> 20:47.392
Okay well, while we're
dealing with all things Brooke,

20:47.405 --> 20:48.981
somebody left a message for you
at the apartment

20:48.997 --> 20:52.020
about styling
a fashion show or something...

20:52.036 --> 20:53.263
What?

20:53.576 --> 20:55.172
Why didn't they just call me?

20:55.188 --> 20:57.453
I don't know. Maybe because
you move from house to house

20:57.468 --> 20:59.861
like a little nomady camel.
I saved the message.

20:59.876 --> 21:02.203
Thank you. Oh, Haley...

21:02.835 --> 21:05.730
Just don't tell Peyton
I asked about her, okay?

21:05.878 --> 21:07.460
Okay.

21:15.276 --> 21:17.161
Uh, you wanted to see me, coach?

21:17.178 --> 21:18.910
Yeah, come on in, son.

21:28.956 --> 21:30.621
This is Keith's number.

21:30.635 --> 21:33.153
I'm pretty sure
he'd want you to have it.

21:33.575 --> 21:36.501
- You're taking your medications?
- Yes, sir.

21:36.557 --> 21:37.962
Good.

21:38.246 --> 21:39.793
You know...

21:39.808 --> 21:44.091
It took every ounce of strength
your mother has to come in here

21:44.107 --> 21:46.772
and ask me to take you back.

21:47.035 --> 21:48.840
She loves you that much.

21:48.856 --> 21:52.292
Enough to put your dreams
ahead of her fears.

21:52.575 --> 21:56.401
You've got 15 minutes
a game to make her proud.

21:57.626 --> 22:02.212
And a lifetime
to make them both proud.

22:05.976 --> 22:08.560
All right, fans,
the close season is on the way.

22:08.577 --> 22:10.500
If the Ravens can win
the next five games,

22:10.518 --> 22:12.050
they'll be state champions.

22:12.068 --> 22:14.620
But lose one, and the season is over.

22:15.146 --> 22:17.613
Nathan Scott, ***!

22:19.325 --> 22:25.460
The triple threat of Antoine Skills Taylor and
Scott brothers, Nathan and Lucas, are unstoppable.

22:26.075 --> 22:28.290
Ravens by 10.

22:35.555 --> 22:39.140
Lucas Scott has become the Ravens
secret weapon of the 'Vens.

22:39.156 --> 22:41.780
They swing it over to Skills Taylor.

22:43.295 --> 22:47.363
Skills, with the sweet
River Court move for 2.

22:47.375 --> 22:49.103
Smell like **** baby.
bar white toast

22:49.117 --> 22:51.750
Ravens 84,
Bear Creek 62.

22:51.765 --> 22:53.701
The Ravens win in advance.

22:53.715 --> 22:55.831
Bear Creek season is over.

23:09.688 --> 23:12.950
The Ravens ***** dominate
force on this playoff since

23:12.968 --> 23:15.161
the Scott brothers
are on their own.

23:15.186 --> 23:17.470
Luke works the ball to Skills.

23:18.115 --> 23:20.022
Skills gives the alley-oop to Nathan,

23:20.035 --> 23:22.273
and Nathan drives it home.

23:33.018 --> 23:35.570
Long range from Lucas Scott.

23:35.588 --> 23:37.133
Ravens are up by 15 now,

23:37.145 --> 23:41.201
and that is the magic number as Coach
Durham calls it a night for number 22.

23:41.218 --> 23:43.493
That also looks like the end of the road
for the Cove City Cougars

23:43.506 --> 23:45.491
as the Ravens Coast to an easy win.

23:45.508 --> 23:46.450
Gigi?

23:46.466 --> 23:48.811
Dinner or... a movie?

23:48.828 --> 23:50.972
When I ask you out.

23:53.578 --> 23:57.023
And the Ravens advance
to the state quarter-finals.

24:17.675 --> 24:20.571
Skills Taylor brings
the ball up-court,

24:20.585 --> 24:23.233
he finds Nathan Scott
with a no look pass.

24:23.247 --> 24:26.453
Nathan lays it in and
the Ravens have a huge (meet?)

24:27.945 --> 24:31.072
Whitey Durham can feel it,
this is over.

24:34.908 --> 24:38.351
Don't look now folks, but if
Tree Hill can win one more game,

24:38.367 --> 24:41.233
they'll be playing for
the state championship.

24:41.388 --> 24:43.833
The fans are on their feet,
and they should be.

24:43.845 --> 24:46.671
I'll tell you what,
this could be the best Ravens'...

24:54.665 --> 24:55.671
- Yes!
- Yes!

24:55.687 --> 24:58.503
One more game and we are
in the state championship.

24:58.977 --> 25:02.381
Not so fast Hales, I mean, we still got
Verona, and they're pretty tough.

25:02.397 --> 25:04.620
Oh yeah, but between
you, Lucas, and Skills,

25:04.635 --> 25:06.953
nothing's gonna stop us now.

25:09.028 --> 25:11.720
Oh, maybe I spoke too soon.

25:14.738 --> 25:17.821
Nathan, it's just our lights,
what's going on?

25:17.837 --> 25:19.451
I guess that was
our third notice.

25:19.465 --> 25:21.631
Oh God, Nathan, we...

25:22.217 --> 25:24.273
As much as I hate
to say this, I really think

25:24.286 --> 25:26.441
it's time you talk
to your Dad.

25:41.037 --> 25:43.893
I hope you're here to tell me
you're signing with Duke.

25:43.918 --> 25:46.561
I'm not here to
talk about basketball.

25:48.407 --> 25:51.130
I'm having money problems, Dad.

25:51.146 --> 25:54.101
It's serious and...
I need your help.

25:54.117 --> 25:55.943
You know, Nathan...

25:56.087 --> 25:59.770
It broke my heart when you emancipated
yourself and turned away from me as a father.

25:59.788 --> 26:01.851
God knows I tried to be there for you.

26:01.866 --> 26:04.663
But you're married,
and you're a man now.

26:04.755 --> 26:07.472
My sole wish for you
is that you find your way.

26:07.486 --> 26:09.653
But you're gonna have
to do that on you're own.

26:09.667 --> 26:11.273
So you're saying
you're not gonna help me,

26:11.288 --> 26:12.232
not at all.

26:12.245 --> 26:15.012
No, what I'm saying is,
whenever I invest money,

26:15.026 --> 26:17.971
I look on the potential
for return on that money.

26:17.987 --> 26:20.551
Right now, you're not
an investement I'm interested in.

26:20.565 --> 26:21.850
But I'm your son.

26:21.868 --> 26:24.983
Really?
I thought you were emancipated.

26:33.628 --> 26:36.672
Thanks for nothing... Dad.

26:49.068 --> 26:50.502
Haley.

26:51.216 --> 26:54.451
I don't know if
I can have this baby, Karen.

26:58.396 --> 26:59.960
What do you mean?

27:01.156 --> 27:04.292
They shut the power
off last night, and...

27:05.448 --> 27:08.102
I'm the only one
of us with a job,

27:08.118 --> 27:10.850
and I'm pregnant,
and I'm in high school.

27:10.985 --> 27:13.880
And Nathan is this close
to getting his basketball scolarship,

27:13.897 --> 27:16.460
but he can't do that
and have time for a job,

27:16.477 --> 27:20.483
and I really have no idea
how this is gonna work out, Karen.

27:22.615 --> 27:26.610
Haley, when I was your age,
and I was pregnant with Lucas,

27:26.628 --> 27:29.091
I didn't have two pennies
(stripped?) together,

27:29.108 --> 27:31.612
I didn't have any friends,
I didn't have college,

27:31.626 --> 27:34.402
matter of fact, I didn't
even have a family.

27:35.257 --> 27:38.673
That doesn't really make
me feel better, Karen.

27:38.685 --> 27:40.673
Look at you!

27:41.057 --> 27:45.100
You have a great support system,
and friends, and family...

27:45.115 --> 27:46.892
You have a future
ahead of you in college,

27:46.906 --> 27:51.051
but most of all, you have Nathan.

27:53.865 --> 27:56.622
It's sure it's not
gonna be easy,

27:56.725 --> 27:58.991
but you gotta have faith.

28:02.398 --> 28:04.340
Trust me.

28:05.008 --> 28:06.851
You can do this.

28:10.477 --> 28:12.141
You can do this.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.002
So let me get this straight.

28:17.016 --> 28:19.230
You and Peyton are just friends,
right?

28:21.525 --> 28:23.983
I wish I had friends like that.

28:29.616 --> 28:31.292
Derek, hey.

28:31.668 --> 28:34.720
Skills, this is
Peyton's brother, Derek.

28:35.395 --> 28:36.712
Hey.

28:36.727 --> 28:40.263
Who would have guessed
Peyton's brother... was a brother.

28:40.465 --> 28:41.980
Caporal Sommers.

28:41.996 --> 28:43.663
Big Daddy Skills.

28:44.625 --> 28:47.161
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Luke...

28:48.117 --> 28:49.641
Peyton.

28:49.656 --> 28:51.180
I'll leave you to it.

28:51.197 --> 28:52.540
Thank you.

28:59.615 --> 29:01.632
I tried calling you.

29:01.957 --> 29:04.590
I wasn't sure
I wanted to see you.

29:04.656 --> 29:06.112
Like the first time
I called you

29:06.125 --> 29:07.751
and you hanged up on me...

29:07.767 --> 29:10.310
A simple thank you
would suffice.

29:10.937 --> 29:13.760
I was the victim, okay?
It wasn't my fault.

29:13.775 --> 29:16.633
Well, there's your first problem,
right there. Thinking like a victim.

29:16.648 --> 29:18.033
Don't.

29:18.225 --> 29:21.643
Don't judge me, 'cause
you don't know the first thing about me.

29:21.786 --> 29:23.463
You're right.

29:24.357 --> 29:25.963
Let's change that.

29:25.978 --> 29:27.421
Take a ride with me.

29:27.437 --> 29:29.380
Give me one good reason
why I should.

29:29.395 --> 29:32.051
Because right now,
I'm the only family you got.

29:35.327 --> 29:38.440
And if you don't mind me criticizing
your personal apparence,

29:38.455 --> 29:41.081
one of these days
you're gonna have to sleep.

29:56.126 --> 29:58.053
You're not really what
I expected.

29:58.065 --> 29:59.761
What do you mean?

29:59.937 --> 30:03.491
Well, I don't know,
I just expected someone...

30:03.507 --> 30:04.661
I thought you'd be more like...

30:04.676 --> 30:05.951
More white.

30:06.076 --> 30:09.300
No! That's not
what I meant.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.462
Maybe it's the Marine part.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.483
My mother is african-american.

30:13.606 --> 30:16.683
And as far as the Marines goes,
this place saved my life.

30:16.697 --> 30:18.833
When I was just
a little younger than you,

30:19.467 --> 30:23.633
my dad... our dad,
he left me and my mum.

30:24.346 --> 30:27.361
Well, it figures, looks like
the boy was right about one thing,

30:27.376 --> 30:28.951
we got a dead-beat dad.

30:28.965 --> 30:30.610
This is tough.

30:30.626 --> 30:34.241
She worked two jobs,
and that left me pretty much on my own.

30:34.258 --> 30:36.273
I started getting into trouble.

30:36.288 --> 30:39.490
Nothing horrible, but
nothing I'm proud of either.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.332
What I didn't know at the time
was that mostly, I was just scared.

30:43.347 --> 30:46.833
This place showed me
how to not be scared.

30:47.488 --> 30:51.021
Fear is like a disease, so if you
don't treat it, it'll eat you up.

30:51.038 --> 30:51.990
All right. But guess what?

30:52.008 --> 30:54.720
The last Derek I trusted...
Tried to kill me.

30:54.737 --> 30:56.471
I didn't say it would be easy.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.482
Do you think this is easy for me?

30:58.496 --> 31:00.131
I didn't asked for anyone
new in my life.

31:00.147 --> 31:01.740
- Then why are you helping me?
- Because your friend Lucas

31:01.758 --> 31:03.781
cared enough to convince me.

31:04.137 --> 31:06.790
I'm looking at you,
I see that fear.

31:06.806 --> 31:08.972
But I also see strength.

31:10.386 --> 31:11.790
Come on.

31:19.775 --> 31:21.682
Hold it up, okay?

31:21.905 --> 31:23.463
Remind me why I'm
doing this again.

31:23.478 --> 31:25.382
Because it's one of my dresses for TART.

31:25.397 --> 31:26.402
TART?

31:26.415 --> 31:30.543
Textile Art Rude Tour. It's a touring
fashion show to showcase new designers.

31:30.555 --> 31:34.090
And a designer dropped out, and now
I'm in, but I'm running out of time...

31:34.107 --> 31:35.203
so chop chop.

31:35.218 --> 31:36.610
What do I get in return?

31:36.626 --> 31:40.222
Well, you're helping me with my work,
so I could help you with yours.

31:40.236 --> 31:44.101
I could grade your important
papers, give Peyton an F...

31:44.116 --> 31:46.542
I was thinking something
a little more...

31:46.647 --> 31:48.342
Physical...

31:49.946 --> 31:53.090
So that's all this is about
for you? Sex?

31:53.108 --> 31:54.932
Of course not.

31:55.557 --> 31:57.603
Well, what is it then?

31:57.617 --> 32:01.590
I mean, nobody knows we're together,
all we do is sneak around,

32:01.606 --> 32:04.872
not that there's anything wrong
with sneaking around, but...

32:05.706 --> 32:08.161
What's it about if
it's not just sex?

32:08.177 --> 32:09.952
I know it's not fair to you Brooke.

32:09.967 --> 32:13.580
Maybe you're right,
maybe we should stop this.

32:14.305 --> 32:15.851
You could do that?

32:15.867 --> 32:17.950
I don't want to hurt you.

32:18.657 --> 32:20.022
Ouch!

32:20.318 --> 32:22.322
Care to revise that answer?

32:22.336 --> 32:23.961
How about this...

32:24.167 --> 32:26.470
In 3 months,
you'll be done with school...

32:26.487 --> 32:28.421
and then it doesn't matter
what anyone thinks.

32:28.438 --> 32:31.170
And the world can know,
and it will be just about us.

32:31.185 --> 32:32.361
You and me.

32:32.375 --> 32:35.371
Yeah, that's a good answer.
You get an A.

32:35.476 --> 32:37.183
Now old this.

32:38.548 --> 32:41.032
Looks like we're a little
early for smack-down.

32:41.385 --> 32:44.031
We have a boxing team on base.

32:44.728 --> 32:47.671
Well, you better watch out
for my right hook.

32:47.685 --> 32:49.532
You think so?

32:49.926 --> 32:51.153
Thanks.

32:53.118 --> 32:54.623
Okay.

32:55.248 --> 32:56.813
Let's see it.

32:57.127 --> 32:58.471
Right.

32:58.567 --> 33:00.992
I'm serious. Hit me.

33:01.008 --> 33:02.823
Forget it. This is weird.

33:02.836 --> 33:05.320
The first step in learning
how not to be scared,

33:05.335 --> 33:07.382
is knowing how to defend yourself.

33:07.437 --> 33:10.920
- Come on. Hit me.
- I'm not gonna hit you, okay?

33:16.698 --> 33:18.181
Derek...

33:18.648 --> 33:20.051
Stop!

33:20.708 --> 33:22.663
Is that all you got?

33:22.927 --> 33:25.780
Punch me like you mean it, Sawyer.

33:27.097 --> 33:28.321
You hit like a girl.

33:28.337 --> 33:29.541
I am a girl.

33:29.556 --> 33:33.590
A weak, scared,
defenseless little girl.

33:36.305 --> 33:37.790
Okay, Sawyer,

33:37.805 --> 33:40.320
so there's actually
a real person in there.

33:40.338 --> 33:41.703
Again.

33:42.765 --> 33:44.501
Hands up.

33:46.238 --> 33:47.433
Yeah!

33:47.445 --> 33:49.341
You're scared, uh?

33:49.357 --> 33:50.940
You wanna act like
a little baby, and cry,

33:50.956 --> 33:52.280
and stay in the house
all the time?

33:52.298 --> 33:53.591
No.

33:53.605 --> 33:54.813
Shut up.

33:55.098 --> 33:56.451
Picture, Peyton...

33:56.465 --> 33:58.303
Picture everything that hurts
you, and fight it back.

33:58.315 --> 34:00.300
Yeah, fight back! Yeah!

34:00.317 --> 34:03.212
Yeah, fight back, yeah!

34:04.828 --> 34:05.980
Yeah, yeah.

34:09.827 --> 34:11.632
Yeah, yeah, fight back.

34:20.288 --> 34:22.243
Yeah, fight back!

34:26.695 --> 34:27.969
Shut up!

34:53.047 --> 34:55.449
Okay, this Gigi thing
is a DEFCON 5.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.291
- You gotta help me for this.
- Okay.

34:57.306 --> 34:59.172
The blow-off 101,
let's review.

34:59.187 --> 35:01.010
One, you can't date her right now,

35:01.026 --> 35:02.372
but it's not her, it's you.

35:02.388 --> 35:03.941
Two, you're so messed up right now,

35:03.956 --> 35:05.181
she'd be miserable dating you.

35:05.196 --> 35:08.562
Three, there are way better guys
she could have in her life,

35:08.577 --> 35:11.331
and forth, are you ready for this?

35:11.348 --> 35:15.212
Dating would ruin
your really special friendship.

35:15.225 --> 35:17.652
But listen Mouth, if she gets bummed when
you tell her you wanna be good friends,

35:17.665 --> 35:19.773
then tell her you wanna be
great friends, okay?

35:19.787 --> 35:22.561
Mouth, are you listening?

35:22.577 --> 35:24.043
It's okay.

35:24.058 --> 35:26.352
I've already heard this speech.

35:31.168 --> 35:32.630
Hey, Mouth.

35:32.646 --> 35:34.981
Gigi, I know you wanna
ask me out,

35:34.997 --> 35:37.381
but I don't want you to.

35:38.028 --> 35:39.761
Because...

35:39.776 --> 35:42.370
I wanna ask you out.

35:44.706 --> 35:47.202
Uh... I'll have to think about it,

35:47.218 --> 35:49.572
and get back to you.

35:52.575 --> 35:57.573
Okay, I've thought about it and...
I'd love to go out with you Mouth.

36:01.635 --> 36:05.801
<i>When life comes rushing at you
from out of the darkness,</i>

36:05.816 --> 36:08.673
<i>who will you chose
to face it with?</i>

36:08.975 --> 36:11.032
<i>Will it be someone you trust?</i>

36:11.045 --> 36:13.900
What are we gonna do Nathan,
if we...

36:15.395 --> 36:17.662
I took care of it.

36:20.398 --> 36:23.712
I know that must have been really
difficult for you to talk to your father,

36:23.725 --> 36:26.093
thank you for doing that for me.

36:31.557 --> 36:35.232
Thank you for doing that for us.

36:39.736 --> 36:41.803
<i>Burning the midnight oil, killer?</i>

36:47.987 --> 36:49.422
<i>Who is this?</i>

36:51.857 --> 36:53.683
<i>I know what you did.</i>

37:01.848 --> 37:04.002
<i>Will they be wise?</i>

37:04.066 --> 37:05.731
Oh, what's that for?

37:05.747 --> 37:07.381
Because you were right.

37:07.398 --> 37:11.403
I have a great future
and I have great friends,

37:11.418 --> 37:13.700
and I have the best husband.

37:13.945 --> 37:16.633
You know what I'm
really thankful for?

37:16.647 --> 37:18.782
I have you.

37:32.106 --> 37:34.010
How's our star player doing?

37:34.026 --> 37:34.923
Good.

37:34.937 --> 37:37.192
And thanks man,
I know that was a lot of money,

37:37.205 --> 37:39.650
but I'm gonna pay you back.
Every cent.

37:39.668 --> 37:41.482
Take your time.

37:41.498 --> 37:44.163
Just don't disappoint me
out there, Nate.

37:48.098 --> 37:49.681
<i>And will their love for you</i>

37:49.697 --> 37:52.280
<i>help them to guide
you to the light?</i>

37:53.165 --> 37:56.682
<i>Or will they lose their
way in the darkness?</i>

38:43.325 --> 38:45.621
<i>Will they make noble choices?</i>

38:47.785 --> 38:51.112
<i>Or will that person be
someone untested?</i>

38:51.285 --> 38:53.452
<i>Someone new...</i>

38:57.836 --> 38:59.463
So you're living?

38:59.477 --> 39:02.472
I know we're related Peyton,
and maybe in another life

39:02.473 --> 39:03.473
we'd be closer, but...

39:04.174 --> 39:05.174
I'm a Marine,

39:04.185 --> 39:06.821
and you've got your own life.

39:06.836 --> 39:08.901
I can't be that guy for you.

39:09.717 --> 39:11.702
Why not?

39:12.947 --> 39:15.080
I guess what I'm saying is I...

39:15.095 --> 39:17.241
I don't wanna be that guy.

39:17.735 --> 39:19.600
I'm sorry.

39:54.546 --> 39:57.513
You can take a pass on tonight,
she's gonna be fine.

39:58.057 --> 40:00.142
- You sure?
- No.

40:00.157 --> 40:03.171
But if you keep babying her,
you'll never find out.

40:03.228 --> 40:05.603
Look, you know you should
really get to know her.

40:05.616 --> 40:07.642
She needs someone special
in her life, you know...

40:07.657 --> 40:10.172
She's already got someone
special in her life.

40:10.185 --> 40:11.890
She has you.

40:12.386 --> 40:14.263
Thanks, Scott.

40:17.187 --> 40:20.270
So what?
You're just gonna leave her?

40:20.286 --> 40:22.110
I didn't say that.

40:22.127 --> 40:24.991
I've got some experience with
late night guard duty.

40:25.005 --> 40:27.033
But she doesn't need to know that.

40:27.047 --> 40:30.063
She just needs to know
that she can do it alone.

41:00.898 --> 41:05.111
<i>Life comes rushing at you
from out of the darkness,</i>

41:05.367 --> 41:07.611
<i>and when it does,</i>

41:07.628 --> 41:10.531
<i>is there someone in your life
you can count on?</i>

41:10.547 --> 41:12.982
Come on Peyton, you can do this.

41:16.287 --> 41:20.242
<i>Someone who'll watch over you
when you stumble and fall,</i>

41:25.265 --> 41:27.222
<i>and in that moment...</i>

41:27.665 --> 41:30.600
<i>give you the strength
to face you fears alone.</i>
