00:18.727 --> 00:20.603
[Tawny] Today on Tawny.

00:20.687 --> 00:23.064
Ratcatcher has spent
most of his life in the sewers
catching rats.

00:23.148 --> 00:26.443
But the last thing he expected
to catch there was feelings.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.611
Our exclusive interview
with Gotham's

00:28.695 --> 00:31.239
controversial couple
right after this break.

00:31.322 --> 00:32.991
Wait, is he screwin' a rat?

00:33.074 --> 00:33.908
Sick!

00:36.828 --> 00:37.787
[Frank] No!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.247
Let me out!

00:40.707 --> 00:42.417
[screams] Ah! Frank!

00:42.500 --> 00:44.335
Are you okay?
Maybe you should chill

00:44.419 --> 00:45.962
on going that deep
into the Green.

00:46.045 --> 00:47.881
You know, Swamp Thing did say
it's gonna take some time

00:47.964 --> 00:49.632
for your body
to get used to it.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.634
I gotta assume, at some point,
your boobs will stop sweatin'.

00:51.718 --> 00:53.052
I don't care how sick I get.

00:53.136 --> 00:54.721
I have to find out
where Frank is.

00:54.804 --> 00:56.139
Bruce Wayne's got him.

00:56.222 --> 00:58.767
He... It's just too dark to see
where he is.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.310
I mean,
it's like all that money

01:00.393 --> 01:01.728
and he can't buy a light bulb,
for Christ's sake.

01:01.811 --> 01:03.438
If only we knew someone

01:03.521 --> 01:05.648
who could help us draw him out.

01:05.732 --> 01:06.775
Don't look at me.

01:06.858 --> 01:07.984
We broke up.

01:08.067 --> 01:09.486
Bruce is so clingy.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.988
Even for
an eccentric billionaire,
he's got baggage.

01:12.071 --> 01:15.784
Workaholic, obsessed
with clean eating,

01:15.867 --> 01:17.994
and, you know, those
major abandonment issues

01:18.077 --> 01:20.830
from seeing his parents
murdered as a child.

01:20.914 --> 01:22.457
Well, congrats
on freeing yourself

01:22.540 --> 01:23.958
from the chains of hetero hell.

01:24.042 --> 01:25.794
But can't you just pretend
you want to see him?

01:25.877 --> 01:27.796
You know, maybe lure him
over here and we'll handle
the rest?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.965
No. When I break up
with someone,
I cut them off completely.

01:31.049 --> 01:33.092
[sighs] He's determined
to get me back.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.887
Won't stop
sending me gifts, flowers,

01:35.970 --> 01:38.765
this canary diamond
encrusted tiara.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.683
That is one sparkly meatball.

01:40.767 --> 01:42.143
Oh, that looks
incredible on you.

01:42.227 --> 01:43.770
It's all right.

01:43.853 --> 01:46.898
Mm. He wants me to wear it
to a gala he's hosting tonight.

01:46.981 --> 01:48.233
[Harley]
It's a clunky name.

01:48.316 --> 01:49.526
Did your RSVP?

01:49.609 --> 01:51.027
I'm not going anywhere
near that mess.

01:51.110 --> 01:52.987
Didn't you hear my whole
no-communication thing?

01:53.071 --> 01:54.864
-Yeah, Harls, pay attention.
-Okay.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.200
My point is, if Bruce thinks
there's a chance
you might come,

01:57.283 --> 01:58.451
he will definitely be there.

01:58.535 --> 02:01.079
True, he is
desperate to see me.

02:01.162 --> 02:02.372
[doorbell rings]

02:02.455 --> 02:04.123
Ugh. That better not be
more flowers.

02:04.207 --> 02:06.042
Okay. We're gonna go
to that gala,

02:06.125 --> 02:08.044
grab Bruce, and we're going
to torture him

02:08.127 --> 02:09.879
until he tells us where
Frank is.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.339
[groaning]

02:11.422 --> 02:12.841
No-- Yeah, it's happening.

02:12.924 --> 02:14.342
-[vomits]
-Or, I have an idea.

02:14.425 --> 02:16.386
You'll stay here, rest,
read some mags,

02:16.469 --> 02:19.389
hydrate, get your strength
back up to torture levels.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.891
And I will go kidnap
Bruce Wayne.

02:21.975 --> 02:22.725
[giggles]

02:22.809 --> 02:24.894
[theme music playing]

02:28.231 --> 02:29.482
[Bruce grumbles]

02:31.067 --> 02:33.695
-So, I know it's been
a tough week.
-Mm.

02:33.778 --> 02:36.072
Respectfully,
Selina's being a total B.

02:36.155 --> 02:38.449
Appreciate the solidarity,
but don't talk about her
like that.

02:38.533 --> 02:40.702
You know what always makes me
feel better?

02:40.785 --> 02:41.619
A hug.

02:43.371 --> 02:44.414
But that's not
really our thing,

02:44.497 --> 02:47.375
so, how about focusing on work?

02:47.458 --> 02:49.419
Are you looking at Selina's
Waynestagram stories?

02:49.502 --> 02:50.545
She can tell If you are.

02:50.628 --> 02:52.255
She can? I mean, I'm not.

02:53.089 --> 02:54.173
Obviously.

02:54.257 --> 02:56.259
If no one else
has any new leads,

02:56.342 --> 02:57.844
I'd like to discuss

02:57.927 --> 02:59.304
the CowNews BoyBoy Hat.

02:59.387 --> 03:01.264
By now, I'm sure you've seen
the ads.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.724
According to my source
at the docks,

03:02.807 --> 03:04.726
there's a shipment
coming in tonight.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.311
I'm thinking we intercept it

03:06.394 --> 03:08.438
and see what's really going on
with these hats.

03:08.521 --> 03:10.773
A new hat fad doesn't equal
criminal activity.

03:10.857 --> 03:12.734
Lots of people wear hats.

03:12.817 --> 03:14.444
Am I a criminal?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.697
No, but you look like
you're ready to steal
some kisses.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.656
No? All right.

03:18.740 --> 03:20.158
They're not just hats.

03:20.241 --> 03:21.659
They've got a smart device
that can read your mind

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
and become your own
personal assistant.

03:23.828 --> 03:26.164
-Cool.
-That doesn't sound fishy
to you?

03:26.247 --> 03:27.749
Hats and neurotech?

03:27.832 --> 03:29.959
That can only be the work
of one man.

03:30.043 --> 03:31.502
-Mad Hatter.
-Mad Hatter.

03:31.586 --> 03:34.213
Impossible. I ran Mad Hatter
out of town years ago.

03:34.297 --> 03:36.633
You're making connections
that just aren't there.

03:36.716 --> 03:39.302
Now, if that's all,
I have a gala to get to.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.470
Selina, it's Bruce.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.971
Uh, Bruce Wayne,
your boyfriend.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.973
Ex-boyfriend, lover.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.975
Hey, is this a two rolls
of duct tape kidnapping?

03:46.059 --> 03:48.561
Harley, honey, I don't want you
to go alone, okay?

03:48.645 --> 03:50.688
I'll be fine. Yes, each time
I go into the Green,

03:50.772 --> 03:52.982
it feels like every one
of my cells
is being ripped apart,

03:53.066 --> 03:54.442
but maybe this tea will help.

03:54.525 --> 03:55.526
It's lemon ginger.

03:55.610 --> 03:57.236
Oh, King Shark will come
with me.

03:57.320 --> 03:58.613
What do you say, buddy?

03:58.696 --> 04:00.323
You up for a classic
Shark-Ley adventure?

04:00.406 --> 04:02.283
Kidnap a sad billionaire?
Huh? Huh?

04:02.367 --> 04:03.826
Rain check.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.954
I have to return home
due to the death of my father.

04:06.037 --> 04:07.288
-Sorry, dude.
-Fucking fuck.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.123
Thank you.
This is actually a relief.

04:09.207 --> 04:12.335
He was a terrible shark
and an even worse man.

04:12.418 --> 04:14.045
Oh, so... Congrats?

04:14.128 --> 04:15.838
Not quite there yet.

04:15.922 --> 04:18.508
The good news is
I get to see my little brother,
Prince Shark.

04:18.591 --> 04:19.676
I mean, we're pretty tight.

04:19.759 --> 04:21.177
He's the brother I didn't eat.

04:21.260 --> 04:23.554
So, does this mean you're like
an actual king now?

04:23.638 --> 04:25.139
No, Prince will be King

04:25.223 --> 04:27.558
once I officially pass
on the position at the funeral.

04:27.642 --> 04:30.228
We have confusing
traditions under the sea.

04:33.231 --> 04:35.400
No worries,
I'll just go with...

04:36.234 --> 04:37.568
[gasps] Clayface!

04:37.652 --> 04:38.569
Oh, ho, ho!

04:38.653 --> 04:40.863
Clayface would love to, but...

04:40.947 --> 04:43.700
[singsong] Billy Bob Thornton

04:43.783 --> 04:45.493
is manning the dunk tank

04:45.576 --> 04:49.163
at the glorious St. Louis
Professional Baseballer's
Charity Circus.

04:49.247 --> 04:52.250
Go, team! I'll look up the name
on the way...

04:52.333 --> 04:54.168
Well, I should get going, too.

04:54.252 --> 04:56.254
Have fun storming
the castle, Harley!

04:56.337 --> 04:58.548
[sighs] Okay, screw it,
I'm going with you.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.383
I'm gonna... Oh, wow.
[sighs wearily]

05:00.466 --> 05:03.678
Okay, no more going
into the Green for now.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.764
You've gotta rest.
I got this, NBD.

05:06.848 --> 05:08.433
Okay, Bruce Wayne is just
some dude, okay?

05:08.516 --> 05:10.059
It's not like he's Superman
or something.

05:10.143 --> 05:12.311
I know, it's just...
It's been a while

05:12.395 --> 05:14.063
since you've done a job alone.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.025
She's trying to say
that you're extremely
codependent.

05:17.108 --> 05:19.402
-[cell phone dinging]
-For the love of nuts,

05:19.485 --> 05:21.154
-who is texting you?
-Ugh.

05:21.237 --> 05:22.739
It's that nerd, Batgirl.

05:22.822 --> 05:25.908
Since the escape room,
I've thrown her a couple LOLs

05:25.992 --> 05:27.410
but she just keeps texting.

05:27.493 --> 05:28.870
Babe, you don't
have to be defensive.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.080
It's sweet,
you like to take in strays.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.749
Listen, I'm locked
and loaded, baby.

05:32.832 --> 05:35.251
I got rope, double duct tape,
binoculars, glass cutter,

05:35.334 --> 05:37.795
person cutter and a granola bar
in case I get peckish.

05:37.879 --> 05:40.506
Now, call me
if there are any problems.
Swearsies?

05:40.590 --> 05:43.009
When has anything
I've attempted to do
gone wrong?

05:43.092 --> 05:45.887
But... You're sick,
you save your energy.

05:45.970 --> 05:48.222
Listen, while I'm gone,
you take care of Ivy.

05:48.306 --> 05:51.517
That means you sit with her,
you stream that lubed-up dildo

05:51.601 --> 05:53.144
disguised as a TV show,
Bridgerton,

05:53.227 --> 05:54.812
or whatever people
are horny for
these days,

05:54.896 --> 05:56.272
and make sure
she wants for nothing.

05:56.355 --> 05:58.107
And why would I do that?

05:58.191 --> 05:59.776
Because if you don't,
when I kidnap Bruce,
I'm gonna tell him

05:59.859 --> 06:01.778
you've been saying his name
in your sleep.

06:01.861 --> 06:03.696
[sighs] Be quick, will you?

06:03.780 --> 06:05.656
And try not to
make a spectacle.

06:05.740 --> 06:08.076
I don't need the hotel
tightening up security.

06:08.159 --> 06:10.787
It's one of my favorite
places to steal from.

06:10.870 --> 06:12.622
It's where I got my Picasso.

06:14.082 --> 06:15.958
-[indistinct chatter]
-[man] Hey, Bruce! Bruce!

06:16.042 --> 06:18.878
Hey. Where's Selina
tonight, huh?

06:18.961 --> 06:19.962
Has she arrived yet?

06:34.560 --> 06:36.354
[Harley] Hi-yah! Come here,
you little old--

06:36.437 --> 06:39.273
-[crashing]
-[screaming]

06:40.066 --> 06:42.735
[breathing heavily]

06:42.819 --> 06:44.320
Still takes her vitamins.

06:44.862 --> 06:45.738
[exhales]

06:53.955 --> 06:55.748
[organ music playing]

06:55.832 --> 06:56.749
[low chatter, sobbing]

07:03.714 --> 07:04.590
[door opens]

07:12.265 --> 07:14.392
[bawling]

07:23.693 --> 07:26.612
Where are all the octopuses
and finned aquatic dignitaries?

07:26.696 --> 07:28.072
Shark ceremony only.

07:28.156 --> 07:29.699
It was in Dad's will.

07:29.782 --> 07:31.117
You know how he was.

07:31.200 --> 07:32.869
A snob to the bitter end.

07:32.952 --> 07:34.328
Your father was a great shark.

07:34.412 --> 07:36.539
-So kind of you to say.
-Wasn't he?

07:36.622 --> 07:39.834
Hey. That "great shark"
had relations with his wife.

07:39.917 --> 07:41.043
And his sister.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.420
[giggles]

07:42.503 --> 07:44.755
Dad looks good on you,
by the way.

07:44.839 --> 07:46.799
Thanks, man.
That means a lot.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.720
We're gathered here today

07:50.803 --> 07:53.014
to coronate your new king

07:53.097 --> 07:55.933
and celebrate the legacy
of King Daddy,

07:56.017 --> 07:59.729
who most famously saved us
from our arch enemies,

07:59.812 --> 08:01.731
the sinful Atlanteans.

08:01.814 --> 08:03.941
If they only knew,
during that battle,

08:04.025 --> 08:07.320
Dad was turnt up
on bunk abalone venom.

08:07.403 --> 08:08.905
I'm glad you're here.

08:08.988 --> 08:10.156
Me too.

08:10.239 --> 08:13.576
Now, King Daddy's
firstborn son, Nanaue,

08:13.659 --> 08:15.536
and his brother Kamea

08:15.620 --> 08:17.413
will join me at the altar

08:17.496 --> 08:20.041
for the official passing
of duty.

08:20.124 --> 08:22.501
Your father's royal scepter

08:22.585 --> 08:25.755
is only to be touched by kings.

08:26.505 --> 08:28.132
Whoo! Powerful.

08:29.008 --> 08:30.343
I kinda like it.

08:32.720 --> 08:34.305
Oh, I'm just kidding.

08:34.388 --> 08:37.391
Ah, the Prince is become King.

08:37.475 --> 08:39.352
[cheers and applause]

08:41.312 --> 08:43.481
Are you sure
you don't want to be king?

08:43.564 --> 08:45.733
You are the oldest.
It's your right.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
No, you deserve this.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.445
You stayed here and took care
of the kingdom

08:49.528 --> 08:50.446
and the family.

08:50.529 --> 08:52.156
Even for Dad's diaper stuff.

08:54.700 --> 08:56.160
[cheers and applause]

09:04.043 --> 09:06.837
Yeah, man. Soon enough,
the kingdom will be no more

09:06.921 --> 09:09.090
and I'll be free
of all this bullshit.

09:09.173 --> 09:10.341
I am psyched.

09:10.424 --> 09:11.634
Totally. Yeah.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.636
I mean, wait. What?

09:13.719 --> 09:15.596
[upbeat music playing]

09:19.934 --> 09:20.977
[grunts]

09:21.060 --> 09:22.395
-[crashes]
-[harp glissandos]

09:22.478 --> 09:24.647
Oh, damn. That was
actually beautiful.

09:26.440 --> 09:27.316
[beeps]

09:30.319 --> 09:31.487
[Batgirl]
Freeze, scumbag!

09:32.947 --> 09:35.616
Oh. Hey, girl. 'Sup?

09:35.700 --> 09:37.535
Harley? What the hell?

09:37.618 --> 09:40.037
I thought you were just
staying in tonight.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.330
Eh. Changed my mind.

09:41.414 --> 09:42.665
Are you stalking me?

09:42.748 --> 09:43.666
Ugh, as if.

09:43.749 --> 09:45.126
I'm working gala security.

09:45.209 --> 09:46.335
Cool story. Outta my way.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.586
Not unless
you have an invite.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.504
Ugh.

09:50.756 --> 09:51.591
Ow.

09:52.842 --> 09:54.051
God, you are so clingy.

09:55.511 --> 09:56.929
I don't want to fight you.

09:57.013 --> 09:57.847
Oh, you don't?

09:57.930 --> 09:59.056
Of course not.

09:59.140 --> 10:00.266
We're friends.

10:00.349 --> 10:01.225
Ow.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.601
[cell phone vibrating]

10:02.685 --> 10:04.854
Hey, how's my prickly
little pear feeling?

10:04.937 --> 10:05.980
Do you miss me?

10:06.063 --> 10:07.523
Did you take my tiara?

10:07.606 --> 10:09.567
Screw your tiara. How's Ivy?

10:09.650 --> 10:10.651
She's fine.

10:16.073 --> 10:17.158
[meowing]

10:17.241 --> 10:18.451
Ugh. Gotta go.

10:19.952 --> 10:20.870
[shrieking]

10:20.953 --> 10:23.289
So you do answer your phone.

10:25.541 --> 10:27.126
Ow! Shit, that hurts.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.878
Did I do something wrong?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.629
I thought we were
becoming friends.

10:30.713 --> 10:32.548
-[Batgirl groans]
-I have enough friends!

10:32.631 --> 10:37.261
Oh, really? Let's see,
there's Ivy... end of list!

10:37.345 --> 10:39.680
Oh! So the kitty
does have claws.

10:39.764 --> 10:41.766
I knew you weren't as
"I'm so innocent,

10:41.849 --> 10:44.518
I follow the rules.
I'm Gotham's hall monitor"

10:44.602 --> 10:45.811
as you pretend to be.

10:45.895 --> 10:47.063
[groans]

10:47.146 --> 10:51.067
I don't sound like that,
you stupid... clown!

10:51.150 --> 10:53.069
-Oh! Good one.
-[Batgirl grunts]

10:53.152 --> 10:55.404
You know what?
Maybe I do want
people to like me,

10:55.488 --> 10:57.782
but at least I'm honest
about who I am.

10:57.865 --> 11:01.035
You want a merit badge
for admittin'
you're a fuckin' dork?

11:01.118 --> 11:03.037
-[elevator dings]
-[breathing heavily]

11:03.120 --> 11:04.663
Maybe take the next one.

11:04.747 --> 11:05.790
[both grunting]

11:05.873 --> 11:07.792
-[elevator dings]
-[grunts]

11:07.875 --> 11:09.877
Can you please get the next--
What the...

11:11.045 --> 11:12.129
[Harley and Batgirl groan] Ugh!

11:12.213 --> 11:14.006
[peaceful music playing]

11:15.257 --> 11:17.301
I miss these heart-to-hearts.

11:17.385 --> 11:19.470
Yeah, me too.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.764
Hey, while we're chatting,
sipping 'gria,

11:21.847 --> 11:23.766
can we circle back
to that thing you said

11:23.849 --> 11:25.309
about "the kingdom
will be no more?"

11:25.393 --> 11:27.937
Oh, yeah, that.
I mean, I'm selling it.

11:28.020 --> 11:29.939
An offer came in.
The numbers are right.

11:30.022 --> 11:31.023
Gonna cash out.

11:31.107 --> 11:33.275
Focus on me for a change.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.486
Ah, maybe do
some print modeling work.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.695
Well, who's the buyer?

11:36.779 --> 11:39.365
Would you believe
it's Ocean Master?

11:39.448 --> 11:40.783
[chuckling] Isn't that a trip?

11:40.866 --> 11:42.743
Look, I know
I'm coming to this late,

11:42.827 --> 11:45.538
so no disrespect,
but Ocean Master is,

11:45.621 --> 11:47.123
like, a longstanding enemy

11:47.206 --> 11:49.083
who famously hates
the shark kingdom.

11:49.166 --> 11:50.709
Well, his money
spends as good

11:50.793 --> 11:53.963
as the next guy-slash-fish-
slash-bivalve. [chuckles]

11:54.046 --> 11:55.631
Did you run this by anyone?

11:55.714 --> 11:57.967
Nope. That's the great thing
about being a king,

11:58.050 --> 11:59.760
I don't have to answer
to no one.

11:59.844 --> 12:01.637
He's going to
develop an outlet mall

12:01.721 --> 12:03.764
and a multiplex theater,
food court.

12:03.848 --> 12:05.266
Hey, what's "fast casual?"

12:05.349 --> 12:06.809
'Cause he said that a lot.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.144
Have you considered

12:08.227 --> 12:11.480
maybe not selling
our ancestral homeland?

12:11.564 --> 12:13.774
"Our"? Oh, oh, that's rich.

12:13.858 --> 12:15.151
Now Dad's dead,

12:15.234 --> 12:16.986
you show up swinging
your double dick around

12:17.069 --> 12:18.154
like you have a say.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.905
You chose to go live on land

12:19.989 --> 12:22.158
and I was stuck here
to deal with Dad.

12:22.241 --> 12:26.036
I had to be the good son,
the one who followed the rules,

12:26.120 --> 12:28.038
the one dealing
with those diapers, ugh!

12:28.122 --> 12:31.250
[choking up] And you know
we all just shit in the water.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.836
So if you got to wear
a diaper down here,

12:33.919 --> 12:35.379
you know things are messed up.

12:35.463 --> 12:37.339
You're right. I should have
been here to help more.

12:37.423 --> 12:39.008
Yeah, well, you weren't.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.968
But now it's my time
to be selfish.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.720
And if you have a problem,

12:42.803 --> 12:45.764
why don't you do
what you're good at and leave?

12:49.643 --> 12:50.853
[Harley] Where are we?

12:50.936 --> 12:53.606
Oh, God! Is this
immersive theater? Ugh!

12:53.689 --> 12:55.816
We demand to know
who you're working for!

12:55.900 --> 12:59.445
The name's Tetch. Jervis Tetch.

12:59.528 --> 13:01.906
More lamely known as
the Mad Hatter.

13:01.989 --> 13:04.700
Well, I didn't take you
for a "mad hater,"

13:04.783 --> 13:07.369
considering how much
you've been snooping
around my shipments.

13:07.453 --> 13:09.288
You won't get away with this.

13:09.371 --> 13:11.874
It's only a matter of time
until people know
the truth about your hats.

13:11.957 --> 13:14.126
Wait, so you're the guy
behind those weird hats?

13:14.210 --> 13:15.878
They aren't "weird hats"!

13:15.961 --> 13:19.590
You see, there's a reason
for the unconventional design.

13:19.673 --> 13:20.883
The newsboy brim

13:20.966 --> 13:23.260
focuses the mind control
of the frontal lobe,

13:23.344 --> 13:25.846
while the cowboy crown
provides ample room

13:25.930 --> 13:27.556
for the processor
and transmitter.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.809
And soon,
I will have an army of puppets!

13:30.893 --> 13:32.478
-[laughs maniacally]
-[Batgirl groans]

13:32.561 --> 13:34.772
You fooled around
with my plans,

13:34.855 --> 13:38.108
and now I'm going to
fool around with you!
[chuckles]

13:38.192 --> 13:41.362
Ugh! Great! Like we need
another run-of-the-mill perv
in Gotham.

13:41.445 --> 13:42.613
I'm not a perv.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.073
I... I torture and murder.

13:44.156 --> 13:45.533
Nothing gross. Is it the hat?

13:45.616 --> 13:46.784
It's the hat, isn't it?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.081
Ew!

13:52.164 --> 13:53.999
Oh, okay,
so now you have a problem

13:54.083 --> 13:56.001
with my incredibly long
pinky nail.

13:56.085 --> 13:58.546
Look, I don't have time to list
all the reasons why
you're pervy.

13:58.629 --> 13:59.672
So I'll leave ya
to your business

13:59.755 --> 14:01.006
and just be on my merry way.

14:01.090 --> 14:02.591
What you two aren't together?

14:02.675 --> 14:04.885
Us? She wishes.
She screwed up my plans too.

14:04.969 --> 14:07.179
Oh, well, now,
you seemed like friends.

14:09.390 --> 14:10.432
Nope. Nope. Nope.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.893
I am not like her!

14:12.977 --> 14:16.230
I am like you. In the...
In the broadest of senses.

14:16.313 --> 14:18.023
I am Harley Quinn.

14:18.107 --> 14:19.567
The Harley Quinn?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.360
Get the heck out of here!

14:21.443 --> 14:24.321
I should have recognized
that beautiful hair.

14:24.405 --> 14:25.739
[inhales deeply]

14:25.823 --> 14:27.700
Okay, it wasn't pervy,

14:27.783 --> 14:30.578
but I could see
how it would seem pervy.

14:30.661 --> 14:32.663
Rabbits, rabbits,
untie this one.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.124
'Kay. Cool. Great.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.625
Harley!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.752
You're just gonna, like,
mind control her
for a bit, right?

14:38.836 --> 14:40.296
Have her do your evil bidding
or something?

14:40.379 --> 14:43.048
I was actually thinking
more along the lines

14:43.132 --> 14:45.050
of Chapter 6 of
Through the Looking Glass.

14:45.134 --> 14:48.137
-That's the one where--
-[shushing] I haven't seen
the movie yet.

14:49.388 --> 14:52.057
Uh, just text me later?

14:52.141 --> 14:53.058
Huh?

14:53.934 --> 14:55.269
[Mad Hatter giggles]

14:55.352 --> 14:56.562
[beeps]

14:56.645 --> 14:58.981
-[Mad Hatter cackling]
-[Batgirl screams]

15:02.234 --> 15:03.944
Guilt makes you look very old.

15:04.028 --> 15:05.988
I look great,
and I am in a hurry, okay?

15:06.071 --> 15:07.489
I have to kidnap Bruce Wayne.

15:07.573 --> 15:09.325
For our girlfriend.

15:09.408 --> 15:11.827
It doesn't matter
how many times you push it,

15:11.910 --> 15:13.329
it won't go any faster.

15:13.412 --> 15:15.623
Ugh! Leave it to Batgirl
to make a simple kidnappin'

15:15.706 --> 15:17.166
so much harder
than it needs to be!

15:17.249 --> 15:19.001
So does she deserve
to be tortured

15:19.084 --> 15:21.211
by a creepy asshole
like Jervis?

15:21.295 --> 15:22.379
Yes!

15:22.463 --> 15:23.922
Maybe? Ugh. I don't know.

15:24.006 --> 15:26.008
And who names
their kid Jervis anyway?

15:26.091 --> 15:27.384
-Right?
-Jervis.

15:27.468 --> 15:28.677
Jervis.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.554
Would it be so bad
to help Batgirl out?

15:30.638 --> 15:33.432
[groans] She's a member
of the Bat Family.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.225
Hello? I shouldn't have to
explain this to you!

15:35.309 --> 15:38.687
All right, jeez. All I'm saying
is it would be a lot easier

15:38.771 --> 15:40.522
if she had a friend there
to help her.

15:40.606 --> 15:41.940
I am not her friend!

15:42.024 --> 15:44.193
Who are you trying to convince?

15:44.276 --> 15:46.236
[sighs] I should go
back there, huh?

15:46.320 --> 15:47.863
I'm not telling you what to do.

15:47.946 --> 15:50.032
I am simply talking it through
with you.

15:50.115 --> 15:51.700
Helping you
track your feelings.

15:51.784 --> 15:53.327
You know, this is why
people hate therapy.

15:55.412 --> 15:57.873
[Ocean Master] Let's get this
show on the road.

15:57.956 --> 15:59.750
Just sign pages two, three
and nine.

15:59.833 --> 16:01.919
The lawyers will do the rest.

16:02.002 --> 16:04.046
Limited edish.
Feather-bound tip.

16:04.129 --> 16:05.964
-[sparkles]
-Platinum-embossed barrel.

16:06.048 --> 16:07.299
She drives real nice.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.842
Damn!

16:08.926 --> 16:10.886
I might have to get myself
one of these after this deal.

16:10.969 --> 16:13.097
[laughs] I like where
your head's at.

16:15.224 --> 16:17.893
God. The hell?
Should I call security?

16:17.976 --> 16:19.937
No, it's just
my dumbass brother.

16:20.020 --> 16:23.565
[chuckles] I get it.
My brother's a dick too.

16:23.649 --> 16:25.526
-It's Aquaman.
-Yeah, I know.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.403
Total dick.

16:27.486 --> 16:30.114
-[King Shark roaring]
-There's a door, like,
three feet away from you.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.573
Why are you always so dramatic?

16:31.657 --> 16:32.908
You can't sell!

16:32.991 --> 16:34.618
This kingdom has been
our family home

16:34.702 --> 16:36.537
for thousands of years.

16:36.620 --> 16:38.455
Oh, wait, hold on a minute.
We talkin' shark years
or human years?

16:39.581 --> 16:40.874
Hah! Just doing the math.

16:40.958 --> 16:42.459
Sure, the kingdom
has drawbacks,

16:42.543 --> 16:43.919
but think about the good times.

16:44.002 --> 16:46.296
Think about all the hijinks,
the games,

16:46.380 --> 16:48.465
the blood-crazed
feeding frenzies.

16:48.549 --> 16:50.426
We'll always have
those memories.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.511
Sharks don't get
Alzheimer's, baby!

16:52.594 --> 16:54.805
I mean, that's actually
the only thing they got right
in Deep Blue Sea.

16:54.888 --> 16:57.599
I don't get why they deviated
so much from the novel.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.435
Wait, stop. I know
what you're doing

16:59.518 --> 17:00.728
and it won't work.

17:00.811 --> 17:02.438
I am selling
and I'm moving up-current.

17:02.521 --> 17:04.356
Now, fuck off back to land.

17:04.440 --> 17:06.233
Now, I can't let this sale
go through.

17:06.316 --> 17:09.069
And how do you plan to stop it?

17:12.197 --> 17:13.782
I just need your signature,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.075
and one initial here before--

17:15.159 --> 17:17.453
[both shouting menacingly]

17:17.536 --> 17:20.289
[inhales]
This evening's entertainment!

17:20.372 --> 17:22.624
Each of you
has a cup filled with tea,

17:22.708 --> 17:24.585
but some of you,
or maybe all of you,

17:24.668 --> 17:26.962
have a spoonful of cyanide.

17:27.045 --> 17:28.547
I'll give the pot a spin

17:28.630 --> 17:31.842
and whomever the spout lands on
must drink.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.386
[slurps tea, clears throat]

17:34.470 --> 17:36.096
[rabbit] No, that's good.

17:36.180 --> 17:37.765
Yeah, for a moment there
I thought you were
gonna kill me

17:37.848 --> 17:39.308
because, you know,
that's what you do.

17:39.391 --> 17:41.059
But, yeah, this is regular tea.

17:41.143 --> 17:44.104
I mean, you know,
got a bit of a kick to it,
but, uh...

17:44.188 --> 17:47.399
[gasps] Oh, God!
That burns so bad...
[sizzling]

17:47.483 --> 17:49.109
-"Earl Grey," she said.
-[rabbit choking and gasping]

17:49.193 --> 17:53.197
She said, "Earl Grey
will make you dead."

17:53.280 --> 17:54.740
[villains cackle]

17:54.823 --> 17:57.951
-This is going to be fun,
don't you think?
-[Batgirl wails]

17:58.035 --> 17:59.953
[shushes] This isn't creepy.

18:00.037 --> 18:01.330
My mom used to do this to me

18:01.413 --> 18:03.040
all the time
while I was tied up.

18:03.123 --> 18:04.792
[Mad Hatter exclaims]

18:04.875 --> 18:07.753
Round and round,
I spin the wheel.

18:07.836 --> 18:11.381
When it stops,
what pain you'll feel.

18:13.383 --> 18:14.885
Your turn. Drink up.

18:14.968 --> 18:17.054
No way!
I'm not one of your goons.

18:17.137 --> 18:18.680
You can't make me do anything.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.516
Are you sure? [snaps fingers]

18:20.599 --> 18:21.850
[grunting]

18:29.942 --> 18:30.943
[groans]

18:31.026 --> 18:32.110
Ouch!

18:32.194 --> 18:34.029
Hey, hat humper...
We're not done!

18:34.112 --> 18:37.574
Well, well, well. Tea for two!

18:37.658 --> 18:40.494
Take her down! Kill the clown!

18:40.577 --> 18:44.623
And bring me their heads!

18:44.706 --> 18:45.791
[both shouting]

18:48.585 --> 18:49.795
[rabbits groaning]

18:54.800 --> 18:56.051
[grunting]

18:57.636 --> 18:58.720
[dishware breaking]

18:58.804 --> 19:00.556
Harley, please!

19:00.639 --> 19:03.517
Where is the honor
amongst villains?

19:03.600 --> 19:04.560
Hey, don't look at me.

19:04.643 --> 19:05.561
Look at her.

19:05.644 --> 19:08.105
[Mad Hatter groaning in pain]

19:08.188 --> 19:09.481
Why are you smiling?

19:09.565 --> 19:11.149
You were seconds away
from being puppeted

19:11.233 --> 19:12.985
by a leprechaun in a funky hat.

19:13.068 --> 19:14.236
I knew you'd come back.

19:14.319 --> 19:15.904
You may not be
a bona fide hero,

19:15.988 --> 19:17.865
but you're not
as ruthless as you think.

19:17.948 --> 19:20.242
[Mad Hatter whimpering]

19:22.035 --> 19:23.412
-You were sayin'?
-Yeesh.

19:23.495 --> 19:25.414
Did you really just kill him
to contradict me?

19:25.497 --> 19:27.374
I like killing assholes.
Don't read into it.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.042
Whatever you say... friend.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.461
[sighs] We are
in the area of friendship.

19:31.545 --> 19:33.046
We're not making bracelets yet.

19:34.047 --> 19:35.299
We're not!

19:35.382 --> 19:38.051
Oh, and FYI,
when someone texts LOL period,

19:38.135 --> 19:39.553
the conversation is over!

19:39.636 --> 19:42.139
Got it. Where you goin'?
Off to do another good deed?

19:42.222 --> 19:43.390
LOL period!

19:44.391 --> 19:46.393
[ballroom music playing]

19:51.023 --> 19:52.441
Ugh!

19:52.524 --> 19:56.403
[singsong] Bruce!
Oh, Bruce.

19:56.486 --> 19:57.362
Selena!

19:58.363 --> 19:59.573
Hiya, Brucey!

20:00.073 --> 20:00.949
[grunts]

20:01.033 --> 20:02.242
[Bruce groans]

20:06.163 --> 20:08.790
Ah! I knew it was two-roll job.

20:08.874 --> 20:10.459
[shouting, blows landing]

20:21.386 --> 20:22.804
[grunting]

20:31.313 --> 20:32.940
[screaming] Ow! Oh!

20:38.862 --> 20:39.988
[both shouting]

20:40.072 --> 20:41.198
[both screaming]

20:45.744 --> 20:48.080
[Ocean Master exclaiming] Whoa!

21:02.219 --> 21:03.762
[both grunting]

21:03.845 --> 21:05.138
What are you gonna do, huh?

21:05.222 --> 21:08.225
Eat me like you did
our other brothers?

21:08.308 --> 21:10.060
Oh, you know
that was a mistake.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.063
I suffer from
hypoglycemic-induced blackouts!

21:13.146 --> 21:15.649
All 13 times?

21:15.732 --> 21:17.859
[exclaims]
My beautiful helmet!

21:19.444 --> 21:20.529
[Prince Shark growling]

21:20.612 --> 21:21.989
You don't have to
do this alone.

21:22.072 --> 21:23.865
We could work this out,
make our own rules.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.201
Maybe figure out a system
where we alternate duties,

21:26.284 --> 21:28.495
you know, give us both time
to pursue our passions.

21:28.578 --> 21:30.747
There's a lot of great
scheduling apps out there.

21:32.624 --> 21:35.168
-[gasps]
-[Prince Shark grunting]

21:35.252 --> 21:36.169
[both grunting]

21:36.253 --> 21:38.880
Oh, God, Jesus!

21:38.964 --> 21:41.842
-[Prince Shark choking]
-I don't want the helmet back.

21:43.343 --> 21:44.636
[gasps]

21:47.014 --> 21:48.307
I didn't want this.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.769
So, did we leave room
for dessert?

21:59.443 --> 22:00.652
[drilling]

22:00.736 --> 22:03.030
Shit, I just did this
then minutes ago.

22:03.113 --> 22:04.239
[Harley shouts]

22:04.322 --> 22:06.742
Ah! Harls?

22:06.825 --> 22:08.201
Who has two thumbs to break

22:08.285 --> 22:10.203
and a full set of
teeth to yank out...

22:10.287 --> 22:11.913
This guy!

22:11.997 --> 22:15.417
[muffled] Mommy, come back.
I'll be a good boy.

22:15.500 --> 22:18.879
Oh, shit. Okay,
so there's that baggage
you were talking about.

22:18.962 --> 22:21.256
I cannot be here
when he wakes up.

22:26.261 --> 22:28.346
[theme music playing]
