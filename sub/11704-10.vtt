03:21.200 --> 03:22.577
{\an8}MIKE, I HAVE TO ASK YOU.

03:22.660 --> 03:24.120
{\an8}DID YOU ANOINT YOURSELF
MAN OF THE HOUSE,

03:24.203 --> 03:25.955
{\an8}OR WAS THAT TITLE
GIVEN TO YOU?

{\an8}- UH, YOU KNOW WHAT,
I MAY HAVE, UH...

{\an8}POSSIBLY SELF-APPOINTED MYSELF
IN THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION,

{\an8}BUT...I HAD
NO PROBLEM CLAIMING THAT.

03:35.340 --> 03:35.924
{\an8}BETWEEN THE COOKING
AND THE CLEANING

03:36.007 --> 03:38.801
{\an8}AND THE SHOPPING FOR FOOD,

03:38.885 --> 03:40.803

IN THAT EQUATION.

{\an8}- WHEREVER I GO,
I JUST TRY TO HAVE FUN,

03:54.484 --> 03:56.277
{\an8}AND MY PERSONALITY SHOWS.

03:56.361 --> 03:57.028
{\an8}I MEAN, RONNIE'S GOT
NO PERSONALITY...

03:57.111 --> 03:58.863

04:15.922 --> 04:17.173
{\an8}- YOU KNOW I'M READY
FOR THAT, RON.

13:58.796 --> 14:01.757
{\an8}- WHENEVER WE GO OUT,
SHE HAS TO, LIKE,

14:01.840 --> 14:03.259
{\an8}BE WITH SOMEBODY AT ALL TIMES.

14:03.342 --> 14:05.427
{\an8}FROM WHAT I SEE,
I SEE THAT JENNI

14:05.511 --> 14:08.264
{\an8}CHEATS ON TOM
ALL THE TIME.

14:08.347 --> 14:10.099
{\an8}- I WANT THAT.
I'M A SHOPAHOLIC

14:10.182 --> 14:11.433
{\an8}AND IF I SEE SOMETHING
I WANT,

14:11.517 --> 14:12.351
{\an8}IT JUST SO HAPPENS
I HAVE A BOYFRIEND

14:12.434 --> 14:14.645
{\an8}THAT'LL GET IT FOR ME.

14:14.728 --> 14:18.315
{\an8}- THAT'S IT.
I'M GOING TO THE REGISTER.

14:18.399 --> 14:19.525
{\an8}- OH!

14:19.608 --> 14:20.359
{\an8}- THROW ME OUT OF THE
[bleep] CLUB?

14:20.442 --> 14:23.571
{\an8}- JWOWW IS HEADSTRONG,
DEMANDING,

14:23.654 --> 14:24.655
{\an8}AND JWOWW'S CRAZY.

14:24.738 --> 14:25.948
{\an8}- YOUR FACE?

14:26.031 --> 14:27.366
{\an8}- OH!
- YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING?

14:27.449 --> 14:28.284
{\an8}- GOOD NIGHT.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.410
{\an8}- HOR-RI-BLE.

14:29.493 --> 14:33.038
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

14:33.122 --> 14:34.373
{\an8}- WHERE DO WE BEGIN
WITH THAT?

14:34.456 --> 14:35.874
{\an8}[chuckles]

14:35.958 --> 14:36.709
{\an8}- SO, JWOWW,
HOW DID IT FEEL?

14:36.792 --> 14:38.794
{\an8}- PRETTY GOOD.
PRETTY GOOD.

14:38.877 --> 14:41.547
{\an8}HE HAS THIS "MANTALITY"
WHERE IT'S LIKE

14:41.630 --> 14:42.881
{\an8}HIM, HIM, HIM, HIM, HIM.

14:42.965 --> 14:44.883
{\an8}HE'S GOT TO HOOK UP.
HE'S GOT TO GET A GIRL.

14:44.967 --> 14:46.468
{\an8}I'M NOT GONNA LEAVE ONE
OF MY ROOMMATES STRANDED

14:46.552 --> 14:47.136
{\an8}FOR SOME PIG.

14:47.219 --> 14:48.971
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.
ALL RIGHT.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.472
{\an8}ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.682
{\an8}- SITUATION, DID YOU LEARN
YOUR LESSON?

14:51.765 --> 14:52.933
{\an8}NEXT TIME JWOWW TELLS YOU,
"YOU BETTER COME

14:53.017 --> 14:54.268
{\an8}WITH ME TO THE ROOM."

14:54.351 --> 14:55.311
{\an8}- OH, HELL YEAH.
HELL YEAH.

14:55.394 --> 14:57.605
{\an8}NAH, FROM NOW ON IF SHE SAYS,
"MIKE, YOU NEED

14:57.688 --> 14:59.148
{\an8}TO COME THIS WAY,"
I'MA BE LIKE,

14:59.231 --> 15:00.816
{\an8}"HONEY, I'LL BE RIGHT THERE."

15:00.899 --> 15:01.942
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, NOW DO YOU GUYS
THINK THAT JWOWW'S BOYFRIEND

15:02.026 --> 15:05.863
{\an8}TOM PAID MORE FOR JWOWW'S
ACTIONS EMOTIONALLY

15:05.946 --> 15:07.823
{\an8}OR WITH HIS CREDIT CARD?

15:07.906 --> 15:08.866
{\an8}- CREDIT CARD.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.284
{\an8}- NO, WE WEREN'T
ACTUALLY TOGETHER.

15:10.367 --> 15:11.660
{\an8}WE WERE BREAKING UP CONSTANTLY
DURING THE SHOW.

15:11.744 --> 15:13.787
{\an8}- SO WHEN YOU'RE
FIGHTING WITH TOM,

15:13.871 --> 15:14.913
{\an8}YOU CAN GO HOOK UP
WITH SOMEBODY ELSE

15:14.997 --> 15:16.040
{\an8}AND THEN MAKE UP--
- I NEVER HOOK UP.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.082
{\an8}I DANCE.

15:17.166 --> 15:19.168
{\an8}- SO THAT'S NOT CONSIDERED--
- NO.

15:19.251 --> 15:21.879
{\an8}- I'M GONNA HAVE
TO QUOTE TOM ON HERE.

15:21.962 --> 15:23.756
{\an8}IT LOOKED LIKE YOU WERE,
"GRINDING THE TOOLBAG

15:23.839 --> 15:24.173
{\an8}WITH THE BLOWOUT."

15:24.256 --> 15:27.676
{\an8}[laughter]

15:27.760 --> 15:30.512
{\an8}- ME AND HIM WEREN'T
GRINDING AT ALL.

15:30.596 --> 15:31.847
{\an8}WE WERE UP ON THE STAGE.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.515
{\an8}- WHAT SHOW WERE YOU ON?

15:33.599 --> 15:34.975
{\an8}- WE WERE MAKING LOVE
IN THE CLUB.

15:35.059 --> 15:36.518
{\an8}[laughter]

15:36.602 --> 15:37.269
{\an8}- YOU WERE, LIKE,
STRADDLING [bleep] HIM

15:37.353 --> 15:37.895
{\an8}AND HE WAS, LIKE,
LIKE THIS.

15:37.978 --> 15:39.855
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:39.938 --> 15:41.857
{\an8}I REMEMBER AND IT WAS LIKE
SLOW-MOTION TOO.

15:41.940 --> 15:42.441
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW IF ANYBODY SAW IT.

15:42.524 --> 15:43.651
{\an8}- I HAD FUN, SO--

15:43.734 --> 15:45.736
{\an8}- I HAD A GREAT TIME THOUGH.

15:45.819 --> 15:47.655
{\an8}- BOYFRIEND OR NOT,
I DON'T CARE.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.156
{\an8}HE'S A SUCKER.
KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

15:49.239 --> 15:50.282
{\an8}[laughter]

15:50.366 --> 15:53.160
{\an8}- WELL, I DEFINITELY SAW YOU
MAKING OUT WITH PAULY,

15:53.243 --> 15:56.872
{\an8}SO GIVE US YOUR CONCRETE
DEFINITION OF CHEATING.

15:56.955 --> 15:59.583
{\an8}- UM, YOU KNOW, THAT'S
CONSIDERED CHEATING IN MY BOOK.

15:59.667 --> 16:00.751
{\an8}LIKE, MAKING OUT, HOOKING UP,
LIKE, IN THAT LEVEL.

16:00.834 --> 16:02.378
{\an8}GOING IN THE BED, YOU KNOW?

16:02.461 --> 16:04.713
{\an8}FURTHERING IT.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.341
{\an8}- IT WASN'T WORTH
WHAT YOU AND TOM HAVE.

16:07.424 --> 16:09.093
{\an8}ARE YOU GUYS--SO YOU'RE CLEARLY
STILL TOGETHER.

16:09.176 --> 16:09.593
{\an8}- YEAH, WE'RE TOGETHER
RIGHT NOW.

16:09.677 --> 16:12.388
{\an8}[clears throat]

16:12.471 --> 16:14.306
{\an8}[laughter]

16:14.390 --> 16:15.516
{\an8}- SAMMI, YOU HAD A LOT
TO SAY ABOUT JWOWW

16:15.599 --> 16:17.893
{\an8}AND TOM'S SITUATION.

16:17.976 --> 16:19.269
{\an8}- IT'S REALLY NONE
OF MY BUSINESS

16:19.353 --> 16:20.521
{\an8}WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO
IN HER RELATIONSHIPS.

16:20.604 --> 16:23.148
{\an8}BUT EVERY TIME WE WENT OUT,
I WOULD SEE HER WITH A GUY.

16:23.232 --> 16:25.401
{\an8}SO THAT'S LIKE--
MY MENTALITY IS TO THINK LIKE,

16:25.484 --> 16:27.236
{\an8}"OH, WHAT IS SHE DOING?
SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND."

16:27.319 --> 16:28.612
{\an8}SO.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.322
{\an8}- I DON'T GET
IN NOBODY'S BUSINESS

16:30.406 --> 16:31.407
{\an8}AND IT'S A DAMN SHAME WHEN OTHER
PEOPLE GET IN MINE.

16:31.490 --> 16:33.909
{\an8}- THAT'S TRUE.

16:33.992 --> 16:35.077
{\an8}- SO IF PEOPLE WANT
TO SPEND THEIR NIGHT

16:35.160 --> 16:37.037
{\an8}AT THE CLUB STARING AT
WHAT THE [bleep] I'M DOING,

16:37.121 --> 16:40.416
{\an8}THEN, YOU KNOW, OBVIOUSLY
THEY DON'T HAVE A LIFE.

16:40.499 --> 16:42.710
{\an8}THAT'S IT.

16:42.793 --> 16:44.461
{\an8}[applause]

16:44.545 --> 16:46.296
{\an8}- WELL, OUR NEXT GUEST
COMMITTED ROBBERY,

16:46.380 --> 16:47.047
{\an8}BUT NEVER WENT TO JAIL.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.550
{\an8}WHAT'S UP, VINNY?

16:49.633 --> 16:50.467

16:50.551 --> 16:52.344
{\an8}- VINNY, YOUR TIME

{\an8}STEALING WOMEN,
LOSING WOMEN,

16:55.347 --> 16:57.891
{\an8}AND SLEEPING
WITH STINK BOMBS.

16:57.975 --> 16:59.518
{\an8}LET'S TAKE A LOOK.

16:59.601 --> 17:00.811
{\an8}- BYE, MA.

{\an8}THIS IS MY FIRST 21 SUMMER
AT THE JERSEY SHORE.

17:08.736 --> 17:09.737
{\an8}- VINNY'S REAL FUNNY.

17:09.819 --> 17:11.655
{\an8}WHEN HE GETS A FEW DRINKS
IN HIM, HE GOES WILD.

17:11.739 --> 17:12.698
{\an8}HE STARTS DOING HIS DANCE.

17:12.781 --> 17:14.992
{\an8}HE WAS, LIKE, PLAYING
WITH JWOWW'S [bleep].

17:15.075 --> 17:16.326
{\an8}HE TURNS INTO ANOTHER PERSON
WHEN HE'S DRUNK.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.662
{\an8}WE CALL IT "VINCE BITCH."

17:18.746 --> 17:20.580
{\an8}- THIS IS VINNY.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.623
{\an8}THAT'S ONE OF
THE OTHER ROOMMATES.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.708
{\an8}- HI, NICE TO FINALLY MEET YOU.

17:22.790 --> 17:24.041
{\an8}- NICE TO MEET YOU.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.377
{\an8}- MELISSA DEFINITELY LIKES ME.

17:25.461 --> 17:26.962
{\an8}THE FACT THAT
SHE'S MIKE'S SISTER

17:27.045 --> 17:28.589
{\an8}JUST MAKES IT SO MUCH BETTER.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.590
{\an8}STOP!

{\an8}VINNY KNOWS THAT
I'M THE MAN OF THE HOUSE

17:35.929 --> 17:37.806
{\an8}AND THAT NOT
TO PUSH IT TOO FAR.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.058
{\an8}YO, STAY IN YOUR OWN ROOM
TONIGHT, DUDE.

17:40.142 --> 17:44.730

{\an8}THE SITUATION'S SISTER MELISSA
KIND OF TO GET BACK

18:00.412 --> 18:01.705
{\an8}AT MIKE A LITTLE BIT.
IS THAT TRUE?

18:01.789 --> 18:04.041
{\an8}- IT'S NOT THAT I USED HER
TO GET BACK AT MIKE,

18:04.124 --> 18:05.876
{\an8}BUT, LIKE, THE FACT THAT I DID
HAVE A LITTLE TENSION WITH HIM--

18:05.959 --> 18:07.836
{\an8}- JUST MADE IT
A LITTLE BIT BETTER?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.338
{\an8}- A LITTLE SWEETER.

18:09.421 --> 18:10.380
{\an8}- YEAH, IT DID.

18:10.464 --> 18:11.840
{\an8}IT MADE IT A LITTLE BIT
RIGHT FOR THE GUT.

18:11.924 --> 18:13.509
{\an8}A LITTLE SWEETER.
THAT'S IT.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.261

{\an8}- OF COURSE.
DID YOU SEE MY MOTHER?

18:33.695 --> 18:34.696
{\an8}I HAVE TO BE A MAMA'S BOY.

{\an8}- OH, WE SAW YOUR MOM.

18:37.115 --> 18:38.283
{\an8}IS SHE STILL CUTTING YOUR FOOD?

18:38.367 --> 18:40.202
{\an8}- ACTUALLY, I STEPPED UP
TO THE CUTTING THE FOOD GAME.

18:40.285 --> 18:43.705
{\an8}SHE STILL DOES MY LAUNDRY,
BUT I CUT THE FOOD.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.040
{\an8}BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
ACTUALLY IT'S LIKE

18:45.124 --> 18:46.250
{\an8}THAT TRADITIONAL
ITALIAN WAY.

18:46.333 --> 18:47.876
{\an8}LOT OF PEOPLE, LIKE,

18:47.960 --> 18:49.253
{\an8}THEY LIVE IN THEIR MOTHER'S
HOUSE A LONG TIME.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.255
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

18:53.799 --> 18:56.093
{\an8}THEN SHE COULD.

{\an8}- WHEN YOU HAVE A MAMA LIKE
THAT, RIGHT,

18:57.302 --> 18:58.512
{\an8}YOU CAN'T HELP IT, VINNY?

18:58.595 --> 18:59.888
{\an8}- AM I GONNA FIND
A WIFE TO DO THAT?

18:59.972 --> 19:01.056
{\an8}PROBABLY NOT,
SO.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.266
{\an8}- GOOD LUCK.
- YEAH.

{\an8}- I WOULD LOVE
FOR THAT [bleep] TO HAPPEN.

20:09.541 --> 20:11.710
{\an8}- YO!

20:11.793 --> 20:12.961
{\an8}- ANGELINA'S THIS TYPICAL
STATEN ISLAND GIRL.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.963
{\an8}I KNOW THE WAY THEY TALK.

20:15.047 --> 20:15.839
{\an8}THEY GET [bleep] MAD AND
THEY ALWAYS WANT

20:15.923 --> 20:17.299
{\an8}TO POINT THEIR [bleep]
FINGERS AND--

20:17.382 --> 20:18.675
{\an8}- I THOUGHT I HAD MORE
RESPECT FOR YOU.

20:18.759 --> 20:19.301
{\an8}- DID I EVER SAY ONE WORD
TO YOU?

20:19.384 --> 20:20.969
{\an8}- BUT I HAVE NOTHING.

20:21.053 --> 20:22.596
{\an8}- THEY GET UP,
THEY CAUSE A [bleep] HISSY FIT,

20:22.679 --> 20:24.056
{\an8}AND THEY TURN
INTO THE [bleep] BIGGEST

20:24.139 --> 20:25.474
{\an8}STUPID BITCHES EVER.

20:25.557 --> 20:27.559
{\an8}- WHY ARE YOU SUCH A HATER?

20:27.643 --> 20:28.852
{\an8}- SORRY.
LOOK AT ME.

20:28.936 --> 20:30.312
{\an8}I'M NOT A HATER.

20:30.395 --> 20:31.230
{\an8}[buzzer]

20:31.313 --> 20:31.897
{\an8}BYE, GUYS.
LOVE YOU GUYS.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.815
{\an8}- BE CAREFUL.
- I WILL.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.693
{\an8}- THANKS FOR COMING.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.612
{\an8}[laughter]

20:38.695 --> 20:40.238
{\an8}- GLAD SHE LEFT THE SHORE HOUSE,

20:40.322 --> 20:42.032
{\an8}BECAUSE I WAS ABOUT
TO JERRY SPRINGER HER ASS.

20:42.115 --> 20:47.120
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

20:47.204 --> 20:48.956
{\an8}- ANGELINA, WHY DO YOU
THINK EVERYBODY

20:49.039 --> 20:50.624
{\an8}WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE YOU LEAVE?

20:50.707 --> 20:52.000
{\an8}- I HAVE A MOUTH ON ME
AND I'M GONNA USE IT

20:52.084 --> 20:53.126
{\an8}AND IF PEOPLE DON'T LIKE IT,

20:53.210 --> 20:54.628
{\an8}THEN THEY CAN GO [bleep]
THEMSELVES.

20:54.711 --> 20:56.713
{\an8}- IT SEEMS AS THOUGH YOU'RE ONE
OF THE BIGGEST HATERS AROUND.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.132
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.092
{\an8}I JUST DON'T LIKE WHEN
DIRTY GIRLS COME IN THE HOUSE.

21:00.175 --> 21:01.677
{\an8}HE DIDN'T HAVE RESPECT
FOR US GIRLS

21:01.760 --> 21:03.512
{\an8}IN THE HOUSE, BECAUSE HE WAS
BRINGING TRASH HOME.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.931
{\an8}- SHE'S LIKE, "IF I'M NOT
GETTING [bleep], NOBODY IS."

21:06.014 --> 21:07.516
{\an8}- NO, NO!

21:07.599 --> 21:08.850
{\an8}IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH JEALOUSY

21:08.934 --> 21:10.852
{\an8}OF ME AND YOU OR WHATEVER,
HOW WE USED TO HOOK UP

21:10.936 --> 21:12.020
{\an8}OR WHATEVER.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.105
{\an8}- MAYBE THAT WAS THE DRAMA?

21:13.188 --> 21:14.523
{\an8}YOU SECRETLY WANTED
THE SITUATION.

21:14.606 --> 21:15.691
{\an8}- SHE DOES.
- YEAH, I LOVE HIM SO MUCH.

21:15.774 --> 21:17.609
{\an8}I SWEAR, I JUST WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH HIM EVERY DAY.

21:17.693 --> 21:18.777
{\an8}- OH, PLEASE,
NOT LIKE YOU'RE NOT

21:18.860 --> 21:19.903
{\an8}GON' BE IN MY
HOTEL ROOM TONIGHT.

21:19.987 --> 21:22.364
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

21:22.447 --> 21:23.657
{\an8}- WE KNOW THAT WAS--

21:23.740 --> 21:26.076
{\an8}IT WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST TIME,
RIGHT, ANGELINA?

21:26.159 --> 21:28.286
{\an8}WE ALREADY KNOW THAT YOU GUYS
DID HOOK UP ONE TIME.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.414
{\an8}THERE'S A LOT OF SEXUAL
FRUSTRATION GOING ON THERE.

21:30.497 --> 21:33.709
{\an8}- THEY NEED TO SMUSH
AND GET IT OVER WITH ALREADY.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.293
{\an8}[laughter and applause]

21:35.377 --> 21:37.671
{\an8}- I'M NOT AGAINST
GETTING ANY TONIGHT.

21:37.754 --> 21:38.714
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK SO.

21:38.797 --> 21:40.257
{\an8}- WELL, WE'LL SEE WHAT
HAPPENS TONIGHT.

21:40.340 --> 21:41.675
{\an8}NOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN THE SHOW,
ANGELINA,

21:41.758 --> 21:43.385
{\an8}DO YOU REGRET LEAVING?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.428
{\an8}- I DO REGRET LEAVING.

21:44.511 --> 21:45.846
{\an8}I MEAN, IF I WOULD HAVE
BEEN THERE SINGLE,

21:45.929 --> 21:47.723
{\an8}I WOULD HAVE DONE THINGS
DIFFERENTLY.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.182
{\an8}- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ANYONE
IN THE HOUSE

21:49.266 --> 21:50.851
{\an8}THAT YOU WERE DATING
A MARRIED MAN?

21:50.934 --> 21:52.644
{\an8}- TO ME, DATING A MARRIED MAN,

21:52.728 --> 21:54.396
{\an8}THAT'S NOT THE RIGHT TERM
FOR IT.

21:54.479 --> 21:57.524
{\an8}I WAS GOING OUT WITH A GUY THAT
WAS IN A WRONG RELATIONSHIP.

21:57.607 --> 22:00.527
{\an8}- SO, LIKE, DID YOU HAVE
WEEKENDS OR WEEKDAYS?

22:00.610 --> 22:01.778
{\an8}- EVERY DAY, HONEY.

22:01.862 --> 22:02.738
{\an8}- I'M JUST ASKING
WHAT THE SCHEDULE IS.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.031
{\an8}- DON'T TRY TO PLAY
YOURSELF RIGHT NOW.

22:04.114 --> 22:05.115
{\an8}YOU KNOW YOU WANT ME.
SHUT UP.

22:05.198 --> 22:06.616
{\an8}- I ALREADY HAD YOU,
SO I'M GOOD.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.453
{\an8}[laughter and applause]

22:09.536 --> 22:12.414
{\an8}- HE BROKE HIS NUMBER ONE RULE
AND SHE BROKE

22:12.497 --> 22:13.749
{\an8}THE SITUATION'S HEART.

22:13.832 --> 22:15.417
{\an8}COME ON UP, RONNIE AND SAMMI.

22:15.500 --> 22:20.589
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

22:20.672 --> 22:23.216
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, SO YOU GUYS ARE STILL
TOGETHER AND HAPPY?

22:23.300 --> 22:24.926
{\an8}- YEAH, EVERY DAY.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.178
{\an8}- WELL, FROM THE VERY START
OF YOUR RELATIONSHIP,

22:26.261 --> 22:29.014
{\an8}YOU GUYS ARGUED
MORE THAN TRIAL LAWYERS.

22:29.097 --> 22:29.931
{\an8}LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT SOME OF THESE

22:30.015 --> 22:34.936
{\an8}AWARD-WINNING ARGUMENTS.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.563
{\an8}- I, LIKE, WAS LOOKING AROUND
FOR, LIKE, RONNIE

22:36.646 --> 22:38.899
{\an8}AND THEN I SEE HIM ON THE DANCE
FLOOR WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

22:38.982 --> 22:42.903
{\an8}FORGET YOU.

22:42.986 --> 22:45.113
{\an8}YOU WERE DANCING
WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

22:45.197 --> 22:46.573
{\an8}YOU THINK THIS
IS A [bleep] GAME.

22:46.656 --> 22:48.492
{\an8}THIS IS NOT
A [bleep] GAME, RONNIE.

22:48.575 --> 22:49.951
{\an8}- I WAS GETTING READY
TO PUT YOU IN THE EQUATION.

22:50.035 --> 22:53.330
{\an8}LIKE, YOU IN THE EQUATION.

22:53.413 --> 22:56.208
{\an8}- THEY FIGHT, THEY BREAK UP,
THEY SEPARATE

22:56.291 --> 22:59.252
{\an8}FOR ABOUT AN HOUR OR TWO,
AND THEY'RE RIGHT BACK TOGETHER.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.630
{\an8}- I DIDN'T LEAVE YOU
FOR NO GIRL.

23:01.713 --> 23:03.632
{\an8}I WOULD NEVER LEAVE YOU
FOR A GIRL.

23:03.715 --> 23:04.508
{\an8}BELIEVE ME.

23:04.591 --> 23:06.968
{\an8}THERE'S NO GIRLS
THAT COMPARE TO YOU.

23:07.052 --> 23:09.137
{\an8}- RONNIE AND SAM
IS JUST BOUND FOR FAILURE.

23:14.392 --> 23:16.978
{\an8}- YOU WALK AWAY FROM ME
RIGHT NOW, SAM,

23:17.062 --> 23:18.980
{\an8}THAT'LL BE STRIKE
[bleep] THREE.

23:19.064 --> 23:20.232
{\an8}DO YOU GET THAT?
YOU'RE WALKING AWAY?

23:20.315 --> 23:22.192
{\an8}ALL RIGHT--
- 'CAUSE YOU WON'T EVEN--

23:22.275 --> 23:23.693
{\an8}- [bleep] WALK AWAY THEN.

23:23.777 --> 23:26.488
{\an8}- THEY SHOULDN'T BE FIGHTING AS
MUCH AS THEY DO THIS EARLY ON.

23:26.571 --> 23:27.614
{\an8}- THAT'S IT.
STOP.

23:27.697 --> 23:29.491
{\an8}WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU DOING, YO?

23:29.574 --> 23:30.283
{\an8}- THAT'S IT.
WE'RE DONE.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.161
{\an8}YOU JUST [bleep]
TRAUMATIZED ME.

23:33.245 --> 23:36.623
{\an8}DO YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

23:36.706 --> 23:38.333
{\an8}[bleep] TRAUMATIZED ME.

23:38.416 --> 23:39.835
{\an8}LIKE, STOP.

23:39.918 --> 23:41.503
{\an8}- BUT YOU DON'T GET IT.

23:41.586 --> 23:43.630
{\an8}I WAS SO SORRY I PUSHED YOU.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.673
{\an8}WE'RE KIND OF THE SAME PERSON.

23:44.756 --> 23:45.966
{\an8}LIKE, WE'RE VERY STUBBORN.

23:46.049 --> 23:46.716
{\an8}WE SAY WHAT'S ON OUR MINDS.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.678
{\an8}WE JUST LASH OUT
AT EACH OTHER.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.054
{\an8}I'M SORRY.

23:51.138 --> 23:54.057
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

23:54.141 --> 23:56.351
{\an8}- SAMMI!

23:56.434 --> 23:57.435
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY.

23:57.519 --> 23:59.020
{\an8}WE ALL KNOW, YOU KNOW,
ARGUMENTS

23:59.104 --> 24:00.021
{\an8}CAN BE HEALTHY
FOR A RELATIONSHIP

24:00.105 --> 24:01.481
{\an8}EVERY NOW AND THEN,
BUT YOU GUYS

24:01.565 --> 24:02.732
{\an8}TOOK IT TO A WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

24:02.816 --> 24:03.859
{\an8}WHY ALL THE FIGHTING?

24:03.942 --> 24:04.901
{\an8}- WE KIND OF WENT BACKWARDS.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.111
{\an8}USUALLY YOU GET
TO KNOW SOMEBODY

24:06.194 --> 24:07.529
{\an8}BEFORE YOU MOVE IN WITH THEM.

24:07.612 --> 24:11.158
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE WENT FROM THIRD
TO FIRST ON THAT ONE.

24:11.241 --> 24:13.118
{\an8}- WAS IT HARD FOR YOU TO LIVE
WITH SOMEONE SO SOON

24:13.201 --> 24:15.162
{\an8}RIGHT WHEN YOU STARTED DATING?

24:15.245 --> 24:17.414
{\an8}- UM, NORMALLY I HAVE, LIKE--

24:17.497 --> 24:19.040
{\an8}I GET, LIKE,
VERY "EWW" ABOUT PEOPLE.

24:19.124 --> 24:20.375
{\an8}LIKE, IF I LIVE WITH THEM I FIND
THINGS THAT ARE WRONG

24:20.458 --> 24:23.503
{\an8}THAT THEY DO OR I, LIKE,
GET, LIKE, "EWW."

24:23.587 --> 24:25.213
{\an8}BUT THERE WAS, LIKE,
NOTHING THERE THAT WAS

24:25.297 --> 24:26.798
{\an8}MAKING ME TURNED OFF
FROM RONNIE.

24:26.882 --> 24:29.050
{\an8}LIKE, IT JUST FELT,
LIKE, RIGHT.

24:29.134 --> 24:30.552
{\an8}- I MEAN, WE'RE FINE NOW.

24:30.635 --> 24:31.678
{\an8}WE DON'T FIGHT.

24:31.761 --> 24:33.221
{\an8}WE GO OUT.
WE HAVE A GOOD TIME.

24:33.305 --> 24:36.057
{\an8}I WATCH THIS DISGUSTINGNESS
THAT I HAVE TO SEE.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.934
{\an8}- YOU'RE DISGUSTED BY IT?
- DISGUSTED WITH MYSELF.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.686
{\an8}- I HAVE A QUESTION.
- WHAT DO YOU THINK, JWOWW?

24:39.769 --> 24:40.729
{\an8}THEY SPEND MORE TIME
FIGHTING THAN--

24:40.812 --> 24:45.150
{\an8}- IF HE WAS TALKING TO A GIRL,
I DON'T GET THAT.

24:45.233 --> 24:46.526
{\an8}'CAUSE IT'S LIKE IF I SEE TOM
TALKING TO ANOTHER GIRL

24:46.610 --> 24:49.237
{\an8}AT THE CLUB, I DON'T
AUTOMATICALLY ASSUME HE'S,

24:49.321 --> 24:50.363
{\an8}LIKE, TRYING TO HOOK UP
WITH SOMEONE.

24:50.447 --> 24:51.865
{\an8}I DON'T GET, LIKE, WHY--

24:51.948 --> 24:52.741
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT THAT'S, LIKE, YOUR
OWN BUSINESS LIKE YOU SAID.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.284
{\an8}LIKE, YOU STICK
TO YOUR OWN BUSINESS

24:54.367 --> 24:55.327
{\an8}AND, LIKE,
THIS IS MY BUSINESS.

24:55.410 --> 24:57.412
{\an8}- I DO STICK
TO MY OWN BUSINESS,

24:57.495 --> 24:58.330
{\an8}BUT, LIKE, WHY ARE YOU
GONNA CRY OVER--

24:58.413 --> 25:01.082
{\an8}- WELL, LIKE,
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

25:01.166 --> 25:02.209
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T WANT
TO LOOK LIKE A FOOL,

25:02.292 --> 25:03.835
{\an8}SO IF HE'S TALKING
TO ANOTHER GIRL

25:03.919 --> 25:05.420
{\an8}AND SOMETHING'S GOING ON,
LIKE--

25:05.503 --> 25:07.297
{\an8}- WELL, EVERYONE SAYS THAT YOU
GUYS WASTED YOUR TIME.

25:07.380 --> 25:10.342
{\an8}LOOKING BACK AT THE SUMMER,
WOULD YOU SAY IT WAS A WASTE?

25:10.425 --> 25:11.259
{\an8}- I DON'T REGRET IT.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.761
{\an8}LIKE EVERYONE ELSE HERE,
YOU GO OUT,

25:12.844 --> 25:14.763
{\an8}YOU GO CLUBBING,
YOU BUY DRINKS FOR GIRLS,

25:14.846 --> 25:17.057
{\an8}YOU GO ON DATES,
EVENTUALLY YOU MEET SOMEBODY,

25:17.140 --> 25:17.766
{\an8}AND I DID.

25:17.849 --> 25:19.643
{\an8}- THAT'S A SWEET THING TO SAY.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.604
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

25:22.687 --> 25:24.773
{\an8}WELL, WE'RE ABOUT
TO TAKE A LOOK AT SOME

25:24.856 --> 25:26.608
{\an8}NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN FOOTAGE.

25:26.691 --> 25:28.526
{\an8}- RONNIE CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE THE HIDDEN FOOTAGE.

25:28.610 --> 25:31.780
{\an8}[laughter]

25:31.863 --> 25:33.114
{\an8}IF I WAS RONNIE,
I'D BE, LIKE--

25:33.198 --> 25:33.782
{\an8}- I'M LIKE A KID ON CHRISTMAS.

25:33.865 --> 25:34.783
{\an8}I WANT TO SEE THESE CLIPS.

25:34.866 --> 25:37.869
{\an8}- SAMMI, YOU LOOK A LITTLE
UNEASY RIGHT NOW.

25:37.953 --> 25:39.120
{\an8}WHAT'S GOING THROUGH YOUR MIND?

25:39.204 --> 25:41.957
{\an8}- NOTHING.
JUST HANGING OUT.

25:42.040 --> 25:44.000
{\an8}- [laughs]

25:46.628 --> 25:48.004
{\an8}- YOU SEEM LIKE YOU'RE
KIND OF BORDERLINE

25:48.088 --> 25:48.964
{\an8}ABOUT TO CRY.

25:49.047 --> 25:51.299
{\an8}SEEING THAT REALLY HURT
YOUR FEELINGS?

25:54.177 --> 25:56.554
{\an8}IS THAT WHAT IT IS?

26:03.019 --> 26:04.938
{\an8}- THIS IS AWKWARD.

26:18.702 --> 26:18.994
{\an8}STOP.
STOP. STOP.

26:19.077 --> 26:21.329
{\an8}SAM, STOP.

26:21.413 --> 26:23.290
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, SO WHILE SAMMI'S
GETTING HERSELF TOGETHER,

26:23.373 --> 26:24.582
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA TAKE
A QUICK BREAK,

26:24.666 --> 26:26.418
{\an8}BUT MAKE SURE YOU GUYS
STICK AROUND.

26:26.501 --> 26:28.837
{\an8}WE HAVE LOT MORE <i> JERSEY SHORE:</i>
<i>THE REUNION</i> WHEN WE GET BACK.

26:34.718 --> 26:37.053
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN THINK
I CAN TALK RIGHT NOW.

26:37.137 --> 26:39.973
{\an8}LIKE, I'M SO, LIKE,
SHAKEN, LIKE--

26:40.056 --> 26:41.850
{\an8}I'M JUST, LIKE,
VERY EMBARRASSED RIGHT NOW.

26:41.933 --> 26:43.685
{\an8}LIKE, THAT WAS EMBARRASSING
FOR ME.

26:43.768 --> 26:45.937
{\an8}- OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

26:46.021 --> 26:48.148
{\an8}- JUST, LIKE, EVERYTHING.
- YEAH.

26:48.231 --> 26:49.190
{\an8}- I'LL TRY AND GET OUT THERE.

26:49.274 --> 26:50.358
{\an8}- NO, IT'S OKAY.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.693
{\an8}TAKE A COUPLE OF DEEP BREATHS.

26:51.776 --> 26:56.072
{\an8}LIKE, IT'S OKAY.

26:56.156 --> 26:58.158
{\an8}- I JUST NEED, LIKE,
ONE MORE MINUTE, LIKE,

26:58.241 --> 26:59.659
{\an8}TO BE HONEST AND THEN
I'LL COME OUT THERE.

26:59.743 --> 27:01.453
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.163
{\an8}- DO YOU THINK MAYBE SHE'S A
LITTLE FREAKED OUT

27:03.246 --> 27:04.539
{\an8}ABOUT OUR NEVER-BEFORE-SEEN
FOOTAGE?

27:04.622 --> 27:06.124
{\an8}- YEAH, MAYBE.
IT'S A GOOD POSSIBILITY.

27:06.207 --> 27:06.875
{\an8}- SEEMS LIKE IT HAS YOU
A LITTLE NERVOUS.

27:06.958 --> 27:08.251
{\an8}ARE YOU FREAKED OUT RIGHT NOW?

27:08.335 --> 27:09.336
{\an8}- UH--

27:09.419 --> 27:10.628
{\an8}- MAYBE SHE KISSED THE COP.

27:10.712 --> 27:12.213
{\an8}- JOHN.
- 'CAUSE I DIDN'T DO IT.

27:12.297 --> 27:13.048
{\an8}- THAT'S THE ONLY THING
I CAN THINK OF.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.507
{\an8}- I DIDN'T DO IT.
- JOHN THE COP.

27:14.591 --> 27:16.092
{\an8}- [bleep]

27:16.176 --> 27:17.802
{\an8}- LET'S SEE IF SHE'S MAKING
HER WAY OUT.

27:23.391 --> 27:26.561
{\an8}OKAY, HERE SHE COMES.

27:26.644 --> 27:29.397
{\an8}EVERYBODY, LET'S WELCOME
SAMMI BACK.

27:29.481 --> 27:34.611
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

27:39.449 --> 27:40.784
{\an8}HEY, SAMMI.

27:40.867 --> 27:41.910
{\an8}ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

27:41.993 --> 27:43.119
{\an8}- YEAH, I'M GOOD.
- OKAY.

27:43.203 --> 27:46.039
{\an8}DO YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

27:46.122 --> 27:48.249
{\an8}- I JUST THINK IT WAS, LIKE,
AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN,

27:48.333 --> 27:50.543
{\an8}LIKE, I'M SURE, YOU KNOW,
ANYBODY ELSE HAS HAD BEFORE.

27:50.627 --> 27:52.587
{\an8}SO IT WAS JUST
AN EMOTIONAL BREAKDOWN.

27:52.670 --> 27:53.797
{\an8}- ARE YOU GOOD NOW?
- YEAH, I'M GOOD.

27:53.880 --> 27:55.757
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT.

27:55.840 --> 27:58.093
{\an8}NOW RONNIE AND SAMMI BECAME
A COUPLE RIGHT OFF THE BAT,

27:58.176 --> 27:59.677
{\an8}BUT AS YOU KNOW, THERE ARE
TWO SIDES TO EVERY STORY.

27:59.761 --> 28:02.472
{\an8}LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE SIDE OF THE STORY

28:02.555 --> 28:03.848
{\an8}YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.940
{\an8}- YOU KNOW, IF I HAVE
A BETTER BOND, YOU KNOW,

28:12.023 --> 28:15.402
{\an8}WITH YOUR GIRL THAN YOU DO,
I MEAN, THAT'S YOUR FAULT.

28:15.485 --> 28:15.693
{\an8}IT'S NOT MY FAULT.

28:20.407 --> 28:21.866
{\an8}- HE WAS HOT.

28:21.950 --> 28:23.284
{\an8}[laughter]

28:23.368 --> 28:23.827
{\an8}I LIKE TO DO WHAT I WANT.

28:54.607 --> 28:56.276
{\an8}- YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?
- OH, MY GOD.

28:56.359 --> 28:57.152
{\an8}- THE RELATIONSHIP
THAT WE HAVE--

28:57.235 --> 28:58.736
{\an8}LIKE, THE LITTLE BOND
THAT WE HAVE

28:58.820 --> 28:59.779
{\an8}IS PROBABLY BETTER THAN
WHAT SHE HAS WITH RONNIE.

29:09.873 --> 29:11.166
{\an8}- YOU'RE SO IMMATURE.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.625
{\an8}- I THOUGHT HE WAS.

29:12.709 --> 29:16.838
{\an8}[applause]

29:16.921 --> 29:19.799
{\an8}- SO HOW DOES IT FEEL LOOKING
BACK AT THAT FOOTAGE

29:19.883 --> 29:21.509
{\an8}NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME?

29:21.593 --> 29:23.011
{\an8}- I MEAN, I DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT THAT.

29:23.094 --> 29:24.012
{\an8}YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.388
{\an8}SAM LIKES TO LEAVE OUT
CERTAIN THINGS

29:25.472 --> 29:27.307
{\an8}WHEN WE HAVE CONVERSATIONS,
I CAN SEE.

29:27.390 --> 29:28.892
{\an8}IT REALLY MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE TO ME.

29:28.975 --> 29:29.642
{\an8}I CUT GIRLS QUICKER
THAN BARBERS DO,

29:29.726 --> 29:31.519
{\an8}TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
SO.

29:31.603 --> 29:32.770
{\an8}- OOH.

29:32.854 --> 29:33.813
{\an8}- I MEAN, SHE COULD BE RIGHT
DOWN THE LIST IF SHE WANTS.

29:33.897 --> 29:37.442
{\an8}I REALLY DON'T CARE,
TO BE HONEST WITH YOU.

29:37.525 --> 29:38.985
{\an8}- WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.280
{\an8}SO, SAMMI?

29:42.363 --> 29:43.698
{\an8}- THERE IS NOTHING I CAN SAY.

29:43.781 --> 29:45.366
{\an8}LIKE, THAT WAS EARLY ON.

29:45.450 --> 29:47.160
{\an8}- YOU COULD GO IN THE BATHROOM
AND CRY NOW IF YOU WANT.

29:47.243 --> 29:49.078
{\an8}- I'M NOT CRYING.
- OKAY.

29:49.162 --> 29:50.205
{\an8}- RONNIE, SO WHY ARE
YOU SO MAD?

29:50.288 --> 29:53.374
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU JUST SAID SOME
PRETTY HURTFUL THINGS.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.544
{\an8}- UH, I'M JUST GETTING STARTED.

29:56.628 --> 29:58.296
{\an8}SHE THOUGHT I WAS ATTRACTED
TO JWOWW.

29:58.379 --> 30:01.132
{\an8}I DEALT WITH A LOT OF [bleep]
FROM HER ABOUT ME AND JWOWW

30:01.216 --> 30:03.051
{\an8}AND THERE WAS NO CONNECTION
WHATSOEVER.

30:03.134 --> 30:04.385
{\an8}WE NEVER FLIRTED
WITH EACH OTHER.

30:04.469 --> 30:05.595
{\an8}WE NEVER GOT WITH EACH OTHER.
WE NEVER HELD HANDS.

30:05.678 --> 30:07.847
{\an8}BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
SHE COULD BE FRIENDS WITH MIKE.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.890
{\an8}SO WHO'S THE [bleep]?
ME.

30:08.973 --> 30:12.894
{\an8}- SO TELL SAMMI WHAT
YOU THINK SHE DID WRONG.

30:12.977 --> 30:13.478
{\an8}- SHE'S A [bleep] LIAR.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.773
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT SHE IS.

30:16.856 --> 30:18.608
{\an8}- I DISAGREE.

30:18.691 --> 30:21.277
{\an8}YOU ALREADY KNEW ABOUT THE COP.

30:21.361 --> 30:21.861
{\an8}YOU KNOW EVERYTHING
ABOUT THE COP,

30:21.945 --> 30:22.862
{\an8}THE WHOLE SITUATION.

30:22.946 --> 30:26.449
{\an8}- WELL, NOW I KNOW ABOUT
THE SITUATION, YEAH.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.408
{\an8}- MIKE?

30:27.492 --> 30:29.285
{\an8}THERE WAS NOTHING THERE
WITH ME AND MIKE.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.537
{\an8}MIKE CAN SAY THAT.
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.

30:30.620 --> 30:31.412
{\an8}I NEVER HOOKED UP WITH HIM.

30:31.496 --> 30:33.122
{\an8}I NEVER EVEN GOT
TO THAT BOUNDARY AT ALL.

30:33.206 --> 30:34.874
{\an8}THERE WAS NO ATTRACTION.
THERE WAS NOTHING THERE.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.125
{\an8}- I'LL STICK UP FOR HER.

30:36.209 --> 30:37.585
{\an8}I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
WE HAD, LIKE,

30:37.669 --> 30:40.797
{\an8}A SOMEWHAT OF A FRIENDLY
RELATIONSHIP.

30:40.880 --> 30:42.382
{\an8}WE DID HOOK UP
IN THE BEGINNING

30:42.465 --> 30:44.300
{\an8}AND I KIND OF UNDERSTAND WHERE
HE'S COMING FROM RIGHT NOW.

30:44.384 --> 30:45.593
{\an8}MAYBE SHE--

30:45.677 --> 30:46.761
{\an8}- YEAH, BUT AS A WOMAN,
SHE COULD STEP UP

30:46.844 --> 30:48.263
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN,
SET YOU STRAIGHT.

30:48.346 --> 30:49.764
{\an8}YOU KNOW?

30:49.847 --> 30:50.932
{\an8}SHE'S SUPPOSED TO BE THIS BIG
[bleep] TOUGH GIRL.

30:51.015 --> 30:51.558
{\an8}- HE WAS MY FRIEND THOUGH.
- DOESN'T MATTER.

30:51.641 --> 30:53.726
{\an8}- LIKE, WE HAD A BOND.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.144
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GO
FIND SOME FRIENDS--

30:55.228 --> 30:56.521
{\an8}- WHAT I'M TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND RIGHT HERE

30:56.604 --> 30:58.064
{\an8}IS WHAT EXACTLY DID SAMMI
DO WRONG?

30:58.147 --> 30:59.190
{\an8}IT SEEMS AS THOUGH--

30:59.274 --> 31:00.817
{\an8}- SHE TALKED MAD [bleep]
ABOUT MIKE.

31:00.900 --> 31:02.235
{\an8}HOW MUCH SHE HATED MIKE--
- HE KNOWS IT.

31:02.318 --> 31:03.528
{\an8}I TOLD IT TO HIS FACE.

31:03.611 --> 31:04.612
{\an8}- BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
SHE'LL [bleep] GO BACK

31:04.696 --> 31:07.740
{\an8}AND, YOU KNOW, HAVE LITTLE
CONVERSATIONS LIKE THAT.

31:07.824 --> 31:09.450
{\an8}- AND YOU'RE GONNA RUIN IT?
LIKE, HONESTLY?

31:09.534 --> 31:10.326
{\an8}- NO, YOU.

31:10.410 --> 31:11.619
{\an8}- YOU'RE GONNA RUIN THIS
BECAUSE OF THAT?

31:11.703 --> 31:13.329
{\an8}- YOU. YOU.
- ME?

31:13.413 --> 31:14.747
{\an8}'CAUSE, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU,
THAT MEANT NOTHING.

31:14.831 --> 31:15.915
{\an8}THAT WAS NOTHING.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.126
{\an8}- THAT'S FINE
TILL IT'S DONE TO YOU.

31:18.209 --> 31:20.295
{\an8}YOU THINK A CERTAIN WAY BECAUSE
IT'S NEVER DONE TO YOU.

31:20.378 --> 31:21.337
{\an8}- OKAY, 'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO ME.

31:21.421 --> 31:22.422
{\an8}- THERE YOU GO.

31:22.505 --> 31:24.382
{\an8}NEVER DID ANYTHING TO YOU.

31:24.465 --> 31:26.301
{\an8}NO SECRET FOOTAGE.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.386
{\an8}NO [bleep] BONUS CLIPS ONLINE.
NOTHING.

31:28.469 --> 31:32.015
{\an8}- TO SEE YOU SO UPSET OVER
THIS FOOTAGE, DOES--

31:32.098 --> 31:33.182
{\an8}ARE YOU THREATENED
BY THE RELATIONSHIP

31:33.266 --> 31:36.311
{\an8}THAT SHE HAS WITH MIKE OR HAD
OR EVEN CONVERSATIONS?

31:36.394 --> 31:38.605
{\an8}- NOT AT ALL.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.564
{\an8}HE CARES FOR HER SO MUCH
AND HE'S BEEN STRAIGHT UP

31:39.647 --> 31:41.065
{\an8}FROM THE BEGINNING.

31:41.149 --> 31:42.984
{\an8}- BUT THAT'S WHY HE'S MAD,
'CAUSE HE DOES CARE.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.402
{\an8}IF HE DIDN'T CARE,
THAT MEANS

31:44.485 --> 31:45.528
{\an8}HE WOULDN'T BE GETTING MAD.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.863
{\an8}- BUT, LIKE,
I WANT TO ASK YOU.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.156
{\an8}LIKE, WAS THAT REALLY THAT BAD?

31:48.239 --> 31:50.617
{\an8}- BUT IF I WAS LAYING IN BED
AND JWOWW [bleep] ME--

31:50.700 --> 31:52.952
{\an8}BUT I'M NOT--NO.
YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT.

31:53.036 --> 31:54.537
{\an8}"IT'S NOT THAT BAD."

31:54.621 --> 31:57.165
{\an8}PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES.

31:57.248 --> 31:58.166
{\an8}DID I [bleep]--

31:58.249 --> 31:59.751
{\an8}DID ANY COP WALK AWAY
WITH MY NUMBER?

31:59.834 --> 32:00.668
{\an8}NO.

32:00.752 --> 32:02.003
{\an8}SO WHAT THE [bleep]
ARE YOU TALK--

32:02.086 --> 32:02.920
{\an8}I DIDN'T HOOK UP WITH ANYBODY
ELSE IN THE HOUSE.

32:03.004 --> 32:04.881
{\an8}SO DON'T [bleep]
SIT HERE AND BE LIKE,

32:04.964 --> 32:06.132
{\an8}"THIS AND THAT."

32:06.215 --> 32:07.383
{\an8}PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES
WITH ALL THE [bleep]

32:07.467 --> 32:09.677
{\an8}YOU DID TO ME AND THEN
[bleep] COME TALK TO ME.

32:09.761 --> 32:14.182
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

32:14.265 --> 32:16.893
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE YOU GUYS, LIKE,
ALWAYS, LIKE, FIGHT,

32:16.976 --> 32:18.770
{\an8}BUT YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
GET BACK TOGETHER, SO.

32:18.853 --> 32:19.812
{\an8}- NO, THIS IS IT.

32:19.896 --> 32:20.980
{\an8}- THIS IS JUST GONNA
BLOW OVER ANYWAY.

32:21.064 --> 32:22.065
{\an8}- GO FOR IT.

32:22.148 --> 32:24.442
{\an8}- NO, THIS IS--
WE'RE, LIKE, DONE.

32:24.525 --> 32:26.110
{\an8}- YOU JUST SAID
YOU GUYS ARE DONE?

32:26.194 --> 32:27.820
{\an8}- I GUESS SO.

32:27.904 --> 32:29.822
{\an8}- I MEAN, IF HE'S GONNA RUIN,
LIKE, SOMETHING THAT'S SO GOOD,

32:29.906 --> 32:34.827
{\an8}LIKE, OVER THAT,
THEN THAT'S HIS OWN PROBLEM.

32:34.911 --> 32:35.453
{\an8}- AND HOW DO YOU THINK YOU'RE
GONNA DEAL WITH THAT?

32:35.536 --> 32:37.372
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW.

32:37.455 --> 32:38.456
{\an8}I'M IN L.A. TONIGHT.

32:38.539 --> 32:42.877
{\an8}- [bleep]

32:42.960 --> 32:44.712
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
WHEN WE COME BACK,

32:44.796 --> 32:47.006
{\an8}THIS SHOW WILL GET
A LITTLE JOLT OF ENERGY

32:47.090 --> 32:49.801
{\an8}FROM THE PRINCESS
OF POUGHKEEPSIE HERSELF.

32:49.884 --> 32:52.178
{\an8}AND LATER, WE'LL TAKE
A LOOK AT EVEN MORE

33:11.072 --> 33:14.909
{\an8}- LIKE, CAN YOU GET ME
A FLIGHT HOME TONIGHT?

{\an8}ARE YOU GUYS READY TO TALK TO
THE PRINCESS OF POUGHKEEPSIE?

33:31.884 --> 33:34.137
{\an8}- DON'T EVER SAY THAT AGAIN.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.264
{\an8}- SHE NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION,
BUT JUST GOT ONE.

33:36.347 --> 33:38.307
{\an8}PLEASE WELCOME SNOOKI.

33:38.391 --> 33:39.434

33:40.685 --> 33:43.438

33:43.521 --> 33:44.814
{\an8}- HOW ARE YOU, GIRL?

33:44.897 --> 33:47.817
{\an8}I HEAR SO MANY PEOPLE USING
SO MANY NAMES FOR YOU THERE.

33:47.900 --> 33:51.446
{\an8}SNOOKI, SNOOKER, SNOOKS, SNICKS,
SNICKERS, SNICKIES.

33:51.529 --> 33:52.613
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE [bleep] IT IS.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.198
{\an8}PAULY.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.992
{\an8}- WHAT IS YOUR
OFFICIAL NICKNAME?

33:56.075 --> 33:57.702
{\an8}- UM, WHATEVER.

33:57.785 --> 34:00.538
{\an8}I GO BY SNICKERS, SNOOKI.
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

34:00.621 --> 34:02.206
{\an8}- FROM LONELY OUTCAST
TO LIFE OF THE PARTY

34:02.290 --> 34:04.459
{\an8}TO VICTIM OF BAR ROOM
VIOLENCE,

34:04.542 --> 34:06.544
{\an8}SNOOKI, YOU WERE ALWAYS
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION

34:06.627 --> 34:08.670
{\an8}FOR BETTER OR WORSE.

34:08.755 --> 34:10.797
{\an8}LET'S TAKE A LOOK.
- AH.

34:10.882 --> 34:11.757
{\an8}YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANYTHING UNTIL
YOU'VE SEEN ME

34:11.841 --> 34:14.342

34:14.427 --> 34:15.469
{\an8}OOH!

34:15.553 --> 34:17.972
{\an8}MY CAR'S DEAD!

{\an8}INTO THE HOT TUB.

34:30.610 --> 34:31.527
{\an8}WHAT IS SHE THINKING?

34:31.610 --> 34:34.489
{\an8}- WHY IS EVERYONE ACTING WEIRD
