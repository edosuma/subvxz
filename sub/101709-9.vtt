when to go and when to stay!

12:04.208 --> 12:05.917
I don't want you here anymore!

12:07.291 --> 12:09.083
[crying]

12:10.083 --> 12:13.250
Yeah, the snow wasn't for the soldiers.
It was for you.

12:13.333 --> 12:14.125
-I'm done, Owen.
-[door click echoes]

12:14.208 --> 12:15.125
We're done.

12:15.959 --> 12:17.542
[door closes]

12:17.625 --> 12:20.208
[DeLuca] Owen flew halfway across
the planet and you just kicked him out.

12:20.291 --> 12:22.417
Well, Meredith was right.
I need to go back further.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.291
Pretty sure this is not
what she meant by that.

12:24.709 --> 12:26.750
But if we are re-writing history,

12:26.834 --> 12:29.542
maybe you could, uh,
not kill me this time?

12:29.625 --> 12:31.041
I'm so sorry.

12:32.792 --> 12:36.500
But if I never meet you, I can't hurt you.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.709
Owen, wait!

12:50.667 --> 12:51.542
[bag thump echoes]

12:53.250 --> 12:54.709
Oh.

12:54.792 --> 12:55.875
[sighs]

12:56.583 --> 12:58.250
[laughs]

12:58.333 --> 13:00.125
[sighs]

13:00.208 --> 13:01.834
[sighs]

13:01.917 --> 13:03.917
Oh, I got to go to work.

13:03.959 --> 13:05.500
New boss is a real nutcracker.

13:05.583 --> 13:06.500
[laughs]

13:06.583 --> 13:08.625
Stop it.

13:09.417 --> 13:10.792
[sighs]

13:10.875 --> 13:12.500
Teddy, there's something
I need to tell you.

13:13.542 --> 13:15.083
You can tell me anything.

13:15.709 --> 13:17.458
I love living with you.

13:17.542 --> 13:19.750
I love working with you but...

13:21.333 --> 13:22.625
but it's not enough.

13:23.542 --> 13:25.125
Wait, what?

13:25.208 --> 13:26.375
I want to marry you.

13:26.458 --> 13:27.458
Right here.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.291
Right here, in bed?

13:29.375 --> 13:30.917
Mm, I'd be happy to go with living room.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.625
[both laugh]

13:42.041 --> 13:43.166
What?

13:43.250 --> 13:44.458
Teddy?

13:44.792 --> 13:45.750
Wait, what is it? [sighs]

13:45.834 --> 13:47.417
I just-- I don't know.

13:48.125 --> 13:50.625
I don't want there to be
any secrets between us.

13:51.834 --> 13:53.083
Okay.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.041
So, Allison.

13:57.500 --> 13:59.000
Um...

14:00.875 --> 14:04.000
She wasn't-- She wasn't just my friend.
She was...

14:04.375 --> 14:06.166
She was the love of my life.

14:07.959 --> 14:09.542
Wait, New York Allison?

14:09.625 --> 14:11.000
Yeah.

14:14.083 --> 14:15.458
Wow.

14:15.667 --> 14:18.208
-Owen, I-- I-- I'm--
-Wow.

14:18.792 --> 14:20.208
I'm so sorry.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.000
I'm so sorry that you lost her.

14:24.583 --> 14:27.500
[voice breaking] Yeah. Me too.

14:27.750 --> 14:30.291
Hey, I want to take all that pain and...

14:31.458 --> 14:33.166
[sighs] I can't erase it

14:33.250 --> 14:35.291
but I can spend every day trying.

14:36.667 --> 14:38.458
Please, marry me.

14:38.542 --> 14:40.542
[laughing] Okay.

14:41.959 --> 14:44.083
Alright, okay. You look great.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.583
Do you, Theodora Grace Altman, take--

14:47.667 --> 14:48.500
[cellphone chimes]

14:48.583 --> 14:50.417
Text message, sorry.

14:50.500 --> 14:53.583
-Do you, Theodora Grace Altman, take--
-[cellphone chimes]

14:53.667 --> 14:55.333
-Could you--
-Yeah, of course.

14:55.417 --> 14:56.458
Amelia.

14:56.542 --> 14:59.542
"Yay wedding, yay joy. Xoxo."

14:59.625 --> 15:01.458
[laughs]

15:01.542 --> 15:03.291
-We good?
-Yeah. Why wouldn't I be?

15:03.375 --> 15:04.792
-Okay.
-Okay, sorry.

15:04.875 --> 15:06.458
[cellphone chimes]

15:06.542 --> 15:07.667
[scoffs]

15:07.750 --> 15:10.500
Beth. "Happy you're so happy." [chuckles]

15:10.583 --> 15:12.542
As in your ex-fiancée Beth?

15:12.625 --> 15:14.500
Yeah. I didn't-- I didn't know
that you still talked to <i>Beth.</i>

15:14.583 --> 15:16.750
Why are you saying it like that?
"Beth." What's...?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.375
Well, I-I just didn't think
that you still talked to her.

15:18.458 --> 15:19.709
Yeah. Mondays at 11:00,

15:19.792 --> 15:20.875
but we had to change it today

15:20.959 --> 15:22.458
'cause she had
her parent/teacher conference,

15:22.542 --> 15:23.875
but look. She's so happy for us.

15:23.959 --> 15:24.875
The wedding we all dream of...

15:24.959 --> 15:26.458
-[cellphone chimes]
-Stop it!

15:26.542 --> 15:27.834
[chuckling] Oh, my God, oh, my God.

15:27.917 --> 15:28.917
Cristina?

15:30.041 --> 15:31.667
Cristina's bought us tickets
to Switzerland

15:31.750 --> 15:33.709
as our wedding present.

15:33.792 --> 15:36.875
Wow. We can-- We can go stay with her

15:36.959 --> 15:40.083
and maybe teach a trauma class
at her hospital.

15:40.166 --> 15:41.959
Owen, put your phone away.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.750
-Yeah, anything for you.
-Okay.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.250
Okay, as I was saying...

15:46.875 --> 15:49.500
-[door opens]
-Hey, I'm home.

15:49.583 --> 15:51.458
[Owen] So, uh, Leo will do
Thanksgiving with me,

15:51.542 --> 15:52.792
and Christmas with you...?

15:52.875 --> 15:54.083
Wow.

15:54.166 --> 15:56.208
I didn't know we had bone china.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.583
Are you really sure?

15:57.667 --> 16:01.959
You, me, Teddy, our kids,
all of us, together?

16:02.041 --> 16:03.000
Really?

16:03.083 --> 16:04.917
Wow!

16:05.000 --> 16:07.792
[laughs] You're amazing, Amelia.

16:07.875 --> 16:08.750
Bye.

16:08.834 --> 16:10.875
Hey. So, come, sit, sit.

16:10.959 --> 16:12.166
Come on.

16:12.250 --> 16:14.834
So, uh...

16:15.792 --> 16:18.500
-You were-- You were talking to Amelia?
-Yeah, we talk every day.

16:18.583 --> 16:22.375
She is bringing Leo here
so we can have the holidays all together.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.458
You don't think that's something
that you should've asked?

16:25.375 --> 16:26.667
It's true love, Teddy.

16:26.750 --> 16:28.542
You really want to ask permission?

16:28.625 --> 16:31.166
-True-- You love her?
-How can you not love Amelia?

16:31.250 --> 16:32.542
It's Amelia.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.250
So she comes first?

16:34.333 --> 16:35.542
No, no, God, no.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.208
Cristina comes first.

16:37.291 --> 16:38.709
Wait.

16:38.792 --> 16:41.583
But you-- you married me.
You-- You chose me.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.041
Oh, this is good.

16:43.125 --> 16:44.291
Listen.

16:44.375 --> 16:45.834
It's not your fault that
you don't know how to love.

16:45.917 --> 16:46.750
What did you just say to me?

16:46.834 --> 16:47.917
-I said I love you.
-Oh.

16:48.000 --> 16:50.041
And pass the gravy. But I also love you.

16:50.125 --> 16:51.750
This-- This doesn't feel right.

16:51.834 --> 16:52.792
Because it's not.

16:52.875 --> 16:53.959
The only reason that I came here,

16:54.041 --> 16:56.291
the only reason
that we have a baby together

16:56.375 --> 16:59.166
-is because of Amelia.
-[sighs]

16:59.250 --> 17:00.125
You know what?

17:00.208 --> 17:01.875
We really should be thanking her.

17:01.959 --> 17:03.041
Do you want to call her back or should I?

17:03.125 --> 17:04.250
Get out of my house.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.125
You know, you say that a lot,
but you never really mean it.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.625
That's why I keep coming back.
It's sort of our thing.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.083
I don't want it to be our thing.

17:10.166 --> 17:12.709
Well, then the only alternative
is you realize

17:12.792 --> 17:14.041
one of these days...

17:14.125 --> 17:15.333
One of these days what?

17:15.417 --> 17:17.083
-[timer dings]
-Dessert.

17:17.375 --> 17:19.583
-Ah, yes.
-You'll burn yourself.

17:20.458 --> 17:21.458
I've got it, Amelia. [chuckles]

17:21.542 --> 17:23.166
Teddy. It's Teddy.

17:23.250 --> 17:24.250
What's wrong with Teddy?

17:25.041 --> 17:27.625
You keep looking past me,
like you always do.

17:27.709 --> 17:29.333
Even though I'm right here.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.250
Yeah, I'm done.

17:32.333 --> 17:35.125
I'm done. I am done waiting for you
and feeling like this every time.

17:35.208 --> 17:36.375
I'm done.

17:36.458 --> 17:39.041
-[snapping fingers] It's Teddy!
-I know, right?

17:39.834 --> 17:40.917
I love Teddy.

17:41.000 --> 17:44.792
But... she's no you, Amelia.

17:45.041 --> 17:46.417
-Here.
-[silverware clinks]

17:46.500 --> 17:48.041
Eat.

17:48.125 --> 17:49.583
It's your favorite.

17:56.208 --> 17:57.500
So you guys haven't talked since--

17:57.583 --> 17:59.709
Since she humiliated me at work
and destroyed our family?

17:59.792 --> 18:01.917
No. I was gonna say
since you brought her home.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.208
I just want to make sure that she's okay,

18:03.291 --> 18:04.458
and I'm gonna head back to the hotel.

18:04.542 --> 18:05.875
-Owen.
-Amelia, I don't want to talk to her

18:05.959 --> 18:08.250
because every time I do,
it just makes me angrier.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.417
Okay? And I'm exhausted by it.

18:11.125 --> 18:12.709
So I'm done.

18:12.792 --> 18:14.250
Can you pass me the side part, please?

18:14.333 --> 18:15.625
What about therapy?

18:15.709 --> 18:17.375
I go to therapy. With Teddy?

18:17.458 --> 18:18.959
I don't need to pay
some stranger to sit there

18:19.041 --> 18:20.041
and listen to Teddy lie to me.

18:20.125 --> 18:22.083
Would you cut her some slack?
She just lost DeLuca.

18:22.166 --> 18:24.208
We all lost DeLuca.

18:24.667 --> 18:27.750
I was standing right across from her
the day that he died.

18:27.834 --> 18:30.667
But we don't all have the luxury
of just shutting down completely.

18:32.792 --> 18:34.125
[sighs]

18:34.208 --> 18:35.458
I want her to be well.

18:35.542 --> 18:37.083
Obviously I do.

18:38.041 --> 18:41.792
[sighs] You know, Leo's been
asking to see his Mama all day

18:41.875 --> 18:43.750
and I had to lie to him
and say that she's working

18:43.834 --> 18:45.417
because I don't want him
to see her like this.

18:45.500 --> 18:48.500
He needs her, you know? Allison needs her.

18:48.583 --> 18:50.166
But honestly...

18:50.542 --> 18:52.041
Honestly, I don't.

18:52.125 --> 18:53.500
-Owen--
-All she's ever done is lie to me.

18:53.583 --> 18:54.709
That's all she's ever done.

18:54.792 --> 18:57.000
She didn't tell me
she was pregnant for months,

18:57.083 --> 19:00.875
she cheated on me for weeks
before our wedding night, and...

19:00.959 --> 19:02.667
[exhales sharply]
And you remember Allison?

19:02.750 --> 19:05.250
Teddy's best friend who died?
The one we named our daughter after?

19:05.333 --> 19:06.834
Well, it turns out that
she's not just her best friend.

19:06.917 --> 19:08.667
She's the love of Teddy's life.

19:08.917 --> 19:11.000
And she didn't mention it to me once

19:11.625 --> 19:13.166
in all the decades
that we've known each other.

19:13.250 --> 19:14.458
Not once.

19:14.542 --> 19:16.208
She just mentioned it
as some kind of excuse

19:16.291 --> 19:17.834
for all the horrible things
that she's done.

19:17.917 --> 19:21.250
And there's nothing I can do about it
and talking doesn't help.

19:21.333 --> 19:22.750
Okay?

19:23.208 --> 19:25.083
So can we please just build this bed?

19:26.333 --> 19:27.750
[sighs]

19:27.834 --> 19:29.208
[Baby Allison crying]

19:47.625 --> 19:49.125
I'm never gonna be enough for you.

19:49.208 --> 19:50.375
You sound ridiculous.

19:50.458 --> 19:52.959
[heart beating]

19:56.375 --> 19:59.417
[alarm blaring]

19:59.500 --> 20:02.500
[Teddy] More lap pads. So much bleeding.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.291
Suction.

20:04.375 --> 20:06.583
[beating continues]

20:09.917 --> 20:11.333
[Allison] [echoing] <i>I'll make pancakes.</i>

20:11.417 --> 20:13.166
[beating continues]

20:15.750 --> 20:17.500
Turn that monitor off!

20:17.583 --> 20:18.583
[beating continues]

20:18.667 --> 20:19.792
[DeLuca] Hey.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.458
[beating stops]

20:21.542 --> 20:23.041
It's not gonna make any difference.

20:30.375 --> 20:31.834
Did you always love her?

20:32.333 --> 20:33.792
Allison?

20:33.875 --> 20:35.542
Can we talk about this somewhere else?

20:35.625 --> 20:38.875
Teddy, this OR is very familiar
with your private life.

20:40.542 --> 20:42.166
Was it love at first sight?

20:45.041 --> 20:47.333
I was always drawn to her.

20:48.166 --> 20:51.625
She was the most alive person
I've ever known.

20:53.333 --> 20:55.041
She was good.

20:56.458 --> 20:57.917
And she was kind.

21:06.125 --> 21:07.500
[Allison] 9-1-1!

21:09.250 --> 21:11.333
He was stuck in a bush by the bike path.

21:11.417 --> 21:12.875
I think he broke his leg.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.166
Allison, what?
No, you're gonna get psittacosis.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.667
First off, that sounds fake.

21:16.750 --> 21:18.542
And second, don't you have
a medical kit in your bag?

21:19.625 --> 21:20.875
Okay, okay.

21:21.792 --> 21:25.000
[children laughing]

21:25.083 --> 21:28.041
Both my parents died that same year.

21:29.000 --> 21:30.250
She carried me through that.

21:30.333 --> 21:31.250
Yeah, that's my mom.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.208
What?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.333
[glass shatters]

21:41.375 --> 21:43.166
I will. I will talk to her again.

21:44.041 --> 21:45.500
Thank you.

21:45.583 --> 21:47.000
[receiver clicks]

21:50.500 --> 21:53.291
That was the maintenance manager
at your mom's building again.

21:54.458 --> 21:57.625
Teddy, you're gonna have to go
through your mom's stuff

21:58.041 --> 22:00.375
or they're gonna auction it off

22:00.458 --> 22:02.291
or-- or throw it away.

22:04.333 --> 22:07.792
I would do it for you,
but I-I don't know what to keep.

22:11.875 --> 22:13.500
We played Scrabble.

22:14.375 --> 22:17.750
-You mean when you were a kid?
-Yes, but also when my dad was dying.

22:17.834 --> 22:19.875
We played for almost...

22:20.792 --> 22:22.125
Almost a year.

22:22.458 --> 22:27.417
He was sick, so we would
put the board out on the bed, and...

22:28.291 --> 22:30.709
And me and my dad and my mom.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.375
We played every weekend.

22:33.458 --> 22:35.667
[chuckles] My dad always won.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.291
Until he started to lose.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.125
When he started to lose...

22:41.500 --> 22:43.500
We had time.

22:43.959 --> 22:45.417
We had time to...

22:45.500 --> 22:47.792
-To say goodbye?
-But we didn't say goodbye.

22:47.875 --> 22:50.458
We cheated so that he could win
until he couldn't play anymore.

22:50.542 --> 22:51.625
And then my mom and I, we just--

22:51.709 --> 22:53.375
uh, we put the board away.

22:54.834 --> 22:57.542
But even with-- with all that time...

22:59.208 --> 23:01.917
it just-- it-- it was unimaginable

23:02.000 --> 23:04.083
that he could leave us.

23:04.166 --> 23:07.166
He would never-- He would--
He would never leave us.

23:11.250 --> 23:12.917
I always wanted a pet.

23:13.000 --> 23:16.208
-You mean after he-- he died?
-No, when I was young.

23:16.291 --> 23:18.083
I wanted a pet, and my dad said no.

23:18.166 --> 23:20.542
He said, "When you get a pet,
best-case scenario

23:20.625 --> 23:23.458
is that you love that pet
with all your heart

23:23.542 --> 23:26.166
and then it leaves you
'cause, you know, life span.

23:27.375 --> 23:30.166
So for sure a pet means heartbreak."

23:33.875 --> 23:37.208
He just-- I-- I guess
he just wanted to protect me.

23:37.291 --> 23:39.166
But he wouldn't even let me get a gerbil

23:39.250 --> 23:41.083
because he didn't want me to suffer

23:41.166 --> 23:44.375
and then he just up and dies at age 58.

23:44.458 --> 23:46.417
But at least we got to play Scrabble.

23:46.500 --> 23:48.208
My mom just...

23:48.375 --> 23:52.125
You can't pack up her stuff
because that would mean she died.

23:52.917 --> 23:55.583
And she can't have died
because she was too young.

23:55.667 --> 23:58.458
And she wasn't even sick.

23:58.542 --> 24:02.417
And there wasn't even time
for another game.

24:03.250 --> 24:06.917
Okay, I get it.

24:18.667 --> 24:20.375
and I'm gonna go over there
and I'm gonna find it

24:20.458 --> 24:21.792
and I'm gonna get one of her scarves

24:21.875 --> 24:24.041

24:24.125 --> 24:26.250

24:30.000 --> 24:31.208
You're gonna want some of the stuff

And just the fact that
she was in love with Allison--

For decades.

28:24.667 --> 28:26.458
-She did.
-Ask yourself why, Owen!
