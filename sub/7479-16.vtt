WEBVTT

00:32.499 --> 00:35.559
Outran the cartel.
That's what I'm talking about.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.760
Thought I was done there
for a minute, huh?

00:37.938 --> 00:41.271
California State Taxi Service
ain't no joke.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.902
Protect, serve and get paid, huh?

00:44.111 --> 00:46.238
Better all be in there.

00:46.447 --> 00:47.607
Of course it's there.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.283
Are you guys
looking for another gig, huh?

00:50.517 --> 00:52.815
Police escort,
it's my new way to floss, man.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.111
What do you thi...? Unh!

00:55.623 --> 00:57.420
You're a grand short.

00:57.591 --> 01:00.719
Make this right, or I'll skin those tattoos
off and hang them on the wall.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.290
Ouch.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.760
Last punch I took was
on the playground in second grade.

01:04.932 --> 01:07.423
And what was the name
of this bully?

01:07.635 --> 01:08.897
Stephanie Petersmark.

01:11.772 --> 01:13.763
- Girls punch boys they like.
- I didn't.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.818
"I'll skin those tattoos off you
and hang them on my wall."

01:31.058 --> 01:34.755
You must not recognize
Scarface level game when you hear it.

01:36.697 --> 01:39.791
Ever realize how much easier
the bad guys have it than we do?

01:39.967 --> 01:42.765
All the time. No rules, no loyalty.

01:42.970 --> 01:44.062
No Hetty.

01:46.073 --> 01:50.169
Okay, Mr. Yakuza is tagged
and ready for arrest at a later date.

01:50.344 --> 01:53.711
A mere guppy in the sea of crime
compared to the sharks we're after.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.714
So if you weren't a boy puncher,
what was your strategy?

01:58.952 --> 02:00.715
I ignored them.

02:12.499 --> 02:14.364
Paul, are you here?

02:24.645 --> 02:27.637
Yo, Paul, we got your cut
of the Yakuza deal.

02:27.815 --> 02:29.339
Paul.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.144
Paul.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.853
Hang in there, buddy. Hang in there.

02:37.024 --> 02:38.548
Paul...

02:39.426 --> 02:42.554
- Who did this?
- I turned down a new job.

02:42.730 --> 02:45.858
Going too far this time.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.057
You stop them.

02:48.001 --> 02:49.025
Stop who?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.535
- Stop who, Paul?
- Paul.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.737
He's gone.

03:29.543 --> 03:31.238
Is that an actual red alert?

03:31.412 --> 03:34.210
I mean, are there battle stations now
that need to be manned?

03:34.915 --> 03:35.939
It's a text message.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.608
It's a text message.

03:38.819 --> 03:39.877
What was that look for?

03:40.087 --> 03:41.952
You just... You're very, um...

03:42.189 --> 03:45.454
- Very what?
- You're very tightly wound.

03:45.692 --> 03:47.557
- That's not true.
- It's true.

03:47.761 --> 03:50.127
Your personal electronics
are filled with intensity.

03:50.330 --> 03:52.890
- Something on your mind, Deeks?
- No.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.090
- Is there?
- No.

03:55.436 --> 03:58.599
- Didn't think so.
- You always need to drive.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.740
You set your clocks 15 minutes fast.

04:00.908 --> 04:04.309
You set my clocks 15 minutes fast.
Everything is a competition.

04:04.478 --> 04:06.639
You have to have separate checks
at Starbucks.

04:06.814 --> 04:08.907
You make fun of guys
that order non-fat lattes.

04:09.082 --> 04:13.143
Do you have any idea how exhausting
it is being your partner?

04:13.353 --> 04:15.287
Do you have any idea
how exhausting it is

04:15.456 --> 04:18.687
to hear you ramble on about the
2012 apocalypse earlier this morning?

04:18.858 --> 04:21.851
Not the apocalypse, okay?
It's the galactic realignment.

04:22.029 --> 04:23.462
Geomagnetic reversal.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.859
Timewave Zero, all right?
The Nibiru Collision.

04:26.033 --> 04:28.593
You may know it as baktun 13.

04:28.802 --> 04:30.326
I think you mean, "baktun" 13.

04:30.537 --> 04:34.735
"Baktun"? Really? "Baktun"?
Your Mayan accent is terrible.

04:35.809 --> 04:37.367
That's right.
You know why I know that?

04:37.544 --> 04:40.172
Because astronomers were talking
about it last night at the bar.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.513
Astronomers were at the bar
that you go to?

04:46.954 --> 04:48.954
That sells flavored condoms
at the vending machine?

04:49.022 --> 04:50.990
Why is that so hard for you
to believe?

04:53.627 --> 04:55.959
Okay, the bartender
changed it to the Discovery Channel

04:56.129 --> 04:59.121
after the Lakers game,
but it felt very real to me.

04:59.333 --> 05:00.391
Good morning.

05:00.567 --> 05:02.501
Okay, Hetty, glad you showed up.

05:02.703 --> 05:05.297
It's very difficult to take anything
that guy says seriously.

05:05.506 --> 05:10.307
Says the most serious person
I've ever met in my entire life.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.808
Okay, Deeks is a nice guy.

05:11.979 --> 05:14.470
And Kensi is a nice girl, all right?
It's not her.

05:14.681 --> 05:16.672
- It's not him.
- It's...

05:16.884 --> 05:18.283
It's us.

05:20.187 --> 05:22.485
Well, I don't believe it's a problem.

05:22.689 --> 05:27.023
I'm hearing two people who are
beginning to sound like partners.

05:29.897 --> 05:33.424
Hi. Uh, Callen and Sam are waiting
for you guys in the Ops Center.

05:33.667 --> 05:39.230
And it's pronounced "baktun" 13.

05:42.809 --> 05:44.333
Of course it is.

05:45.546 --> 05:47.241
So nice of you to join us.

05:47.414 --> 05:50.349
Sorry, got held up. Deeks thinks
the world's gonna end in 2012.

05:50.551 --> 05:54.681
Let me guess. Jenkins' theory
on Sagittarius A black hole?

05:54.855 --> 05:56.880
As a matter of fact, yes.

05:58.358 --> 06:00.451
- He's mocking you.
- He's not mo...

06:02.429 --> 06:04.056
An MP from Camp Pendleton

06:04.231 --> 06:06.859
suspected Marines of working
on something with some dirty cops.

06:07.067 --> 06:08.261
It's a CHP crew.

06:08.435 --> 06:11.893
They take bribes from criminals
for armed escorts and smuggling.

06:12.072 --> 06:15.041
They call themselves
the California Gold Taxi Service.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.698
L.A.P.D.
Calls them an urban legend.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.571
L.A.P.D. Is wrong. They're real.

06:19.079 --> 06:21.570
Six months ago, we opened
an undercover investigation.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.808
Sam and I infiltrated the group
going in as corrupt cops.

06:24.985 --> 06:27.476
We got inside, but we still have not
been able to make a link

06:27.654 --> 06:28.916
between them and Pendleton.

06:29.089 --> 06:31.455
Then the ringleader
turned up dead this morning.

06:32.726 --> 06:33.886
His name's Paul Beane.

06:34.094 --> 06:38.428
He left the CHP after surviving
a motorcycle accident while on duty.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.396
Left him paralyzed
from the waist down.

06:40.601 --> 06:43.968
He has a wife,
but they maintain separate residences.

06:44.137 --> 06:46.332
She's not considered a suspect.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.736
Beane turned down a job.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.934
Somebody wanted to make sure
he didn't talk.

06:51.144 --> 06:55.103
Tight grouping. Low caliber.
No exit wounds. Pros.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.510
He's a retired cop.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.275
He must've had somebody
in the field, a point man.

06:59.486 --> 07:00.919
Try point woman.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.287
Officer Jennifer Grear.

07:03.457 --> 07:05.652
She was Beane's partner
until his accident.

07:05.892 --> 07:07.154
He'd find the jobs.

07:07.327 --> 07:10.922
She'd pass on the orders to
the California Gold Taxi Service cops.

07:11.098 --> 07:12.827
They might have had a falling-out.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.298
If Grear didn't shoot Beane,
she might know who did.

07:15.502 --> 07:18.130
So this op just shifted gears.
Something is about to go down.

07:18.338 --> 07:20.636
It may or may not involve Marines
at Pendleton,

07:20.807 --> 07:23.640
but we need to figure out
what it is and fast.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.972
Grear's shift is coming up, so Sam
and I are gonna hit CHP headquarters.

07:27.147 --> 07:28.614
- You two search her house.
- Done.

07:28.815 --> 07:30.180
Got it.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.026
You're giving me a look.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.030
Us riding bikes means
we don't get to talk like we normally do.

07:50.237 --> 07:51.727
Whereas, normally,
we ride in your car

07:51.938 --> 07:53.963
and spend the whole time
talking about nothing?

07:54.141 --> 07:55.506
You calling our banter nothing?

07:55.676 --> 07:58.839
Well, not nothing, but wouldn't say
that it qualifies as something.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.673
Banter is the crux
of our partnership, G.

08:00.847 --> 08:03.873
Without it, we'd be two guys with guns
drifting from one case to the next.

08:04.084 --> 08:06.552
We are guys with guns
drifting from one case to the next.

08:06.720 --> 08:09.689
- Some seek a higher meaning.
- Others play the hand they're dealt.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.653
When did the glass
become half-empty?

08:11.825 --> 08:13.486
Was it ever half-full?

08:14.227 --> 08:15.660
- That's better.
- Mm-hm.

08:15.862 --> 08:18.456
But I still want my car back,
and these boots are killing me.

08:21.368 --> 08:24.235
- Exley, Powell.
- Hey, did you see Grear inside?

08:24.471 --> 08:27.201
Never clocked in. Guess who's stuck
pulling a double shift.

08:27.374 --> 08:31.333
Tell her I'm only accepting apologies
in the form of bourbon and cigars.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.408
Am I really the most serious person
you've ever met?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.777
It's a tie between you
and this nun back at school

08:37.984 --> 08:39.542
who used to whack my hand
with a ruler.

08:39.720 --> 08:43.212
All right, well, I'll have you know
that I can be a very funny individual.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.880
- According to whom?
- People.

08:45.092 --> 08:46.753
- Anyone I know?
- Nell.

08:46.927 --> 08:49.225
- I'm sorry, what?
- Nell thinks I'm hilarious.

08:49.396 --> 08:51.057
Okay.

08:51.798 --> 08:53.561
It's forced entry.

08:53.734 --> 08:55.497
One, two, three.

09:05.645 --> 09:07.579
- Clear.
- Clear.

09:07.748 --> 09:10.148
This looks like a shootout
at the O.K. Corral.

09:11.251 --> 09:12.878
Your instincts telling you anything?

09:13.820 --> 09:17.449
Multiple shooters. Blood trail.

09:19.326 --> 09:20.588
Come here. Come this way.

09:20.794 --> 09:23.957
Someone got hit about here.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.564
And then they ran.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.564
Impossible to say
how far they made it.

09:30.971 --> 09:32.836
If they made it.

09:38.678 --> 09:39.804
So was it Grear?

09:43.891 --> 09:45.620
Or somebody else?

09:55.594 --> 09:58.529
We analyzed spending patterns for
both Paul Beane and Jennifer Grear

09:58.697 --> 10:00.597
over the past 24 hours.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.064
And tried to establish a time line.

10:03.269 --> 10:06.534
Turns out Beane frequented a club
in Hollywood called Bare Elegance.

10:06.705 --> 10:08.798
Credit-card charges show
he was there last night.

10:09.008 --> 10:10.669
Bare Elegance.
Must be a strip club.

10:10.876 --> 10:12.969
Bikini bar. Big difference.

10:13.179 --> 10:14.510
What do we know about Grear?

10:14.713 --> 10:16.681
She's got four credit cards
all maxed out

10:16.882 --> 10:19.442
and two bank accounts
in overdraft status.

10:19.618 --> 10:22.212
Officer Grear's mother
is suffering from Alzheimer's.

10:22.454 --> 10:25.321
Put her in a nursing home last year.
Wiped out her savings.

10:25.491 --> 10:27.482
No one's seen Grear
since Paul Beane's murder.

10:27.660 --> 10:29.719
Well, she's either in hiding
or she's dead.

10:29.895 --> 10:34.161
Okay, Kensi and I volunteer to go
check out the bikini bar in Hollywood.

10:35.534 --> 10:37.798
Where did Grear's mother live
before the nursing home?

10:37.970 --> 10:39.232
House in Van Nuys.

10:39.405 --> 10:41.896
Well, if she's tapped out,
it's probably still on the market.

10:42.107 --> 10:44.337
- Correct.
- I'll drive, you banter.

10:46.512 --> 10:50.312
Are you aware of the difference
between bikini bars and strip clubs?

10:50.482 --> 10:51.744
Yeah, of course. There's...

10:53.352 --> 10:54.410
No.

10:54.620 --> 10:56.611
Is there...? Is there a difference? I...

11:01.994 --> 11:03.689
So let me get this straight.

11:03.896 --> 11:09.766
Strip club, no clothes, no booze.
Bikini bar, clothes, booze.

11:09.935 --> 11:11.766
- Correct.
- Now, which do you prefer?

11:11.937 --> 11:15.737
- They both possess unique charms.
- No, no. The apocalypse is tomorrow.

11:15.908 --> 11:17.034
You got one last night.

11:18.911 --> 11:22.005
That's a dilemma worthy
of King Solomon.

11:30.856 --> 11:33.791
Bikini bar. Yeah.

11:34.760 --> 11:38.025
Bikini bar's definitely
my pre-apocalyptic choice.

11:38.230 --> 11:41.859
Ha-ha-ha. I don't know whether that
makes me respect you more or less.

11:42.067 --> 11:43.796
First date?

11:44.036 --> 11:48.405
Oh, hi. Well, a girl can only do dinner
and a movie so many times.

11:48.607 --> 11:51.804
Yeah. She's cute,
but her sense of humor needs work.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.443
You have no idea.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.738
So a buddy of mine,
he's always talking about this place.

11:56.916 --> 11:58.474
Paul Beane. Yeah? You know him?

11:58.717 --> 12:00.742
Yeah, he's an ex-cop
in a wheelchair.

12:01.320 --> 12:04.812
We get CHP guys in here all the time.
Half-off drinks if you show your badge.

12:05.057 --> 12:07.321
He kept trying to get us
to come meet him last night.

12:07.559 --> 12:10.255
- Do you remember who he was with?
- Ask him yourself.

12:16.302 --> 12:17.599
I wish that I could.

12:19.571 --> 12:22.563
Some guy came in here
looking for him, and they got into it.

12:22.741 --> 12:25.141
- We tossed the other dude out.
- What does he look like?

12:25.311 --> 12:30.943
Forties, gold watch,
kind of a frat-boy look with a bully vibe.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.811
We're gonna need access
to these cameras.

12:33.018 --> 12:34.144
Oh, those don't work.

12:34.320 --> 12:36.720
I just put those in for show.
Deterrence.

12:36.922 --> 12:40.119
What were Beane
and this other guy arguing about?

12:40.292 --> 12:41.589
Is Paul okay?

12:43.262 --> 12:44.752
He was found dead this morning.

12:49.034 --> 12:51.298
Oh, man.

12:54.039 --> 12:55.836
You know, I...

12:56.008 --> 12:57.737
I didn't hear any details.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.878
Just one thing.
The overgrown frat boy told Paul

13:01.113 --> 13:06.949
that this was his last chance,
and if he said no, that he'd kill him.

13:10.489 --> 13:11.649
Thanks, Kensi.

13:11.824 --> 13:13.655
Last night,
Paul Beane's life was threatened.

13:14.193 --> 13:17.060
Bar manager described him
as an overgrown frat boy.

13:17.262 --> 13:19.822
- He was wearing a gold watch.
- Grear still ran, though.

13:19.999 --> 13:22.559
She pulled the trigger or she's hiding
from the people who did.

13:22.768 --> 13:25.066
Could be here at her mom's house.

13:40.819 --> 13:42.081
Nothing.

13:42.554 --> 13:43.646
All right. I'll check...

14:02.441 --> 14:05.604
Pull the trigger, Exley.
Isn't that what they're paying you for?

14:05.844 --> 14:07.436
Easy.

14:08.947 --> 14:12.178
Easy, Grear. Easy. Struggling's only
gonna make it hurt worse.

14:12.384 --> 14:13.681
Easy.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.083
Don't move.

14:20.926 --> 14:24.623
- You're arresting me?
- It's good to see you again, Grear.

14:24.830 --> 14:26.525
Turn around.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.095
You're not really CHP.

14:32.438 --> 14:34.429
Always thought
the boots looked funny on you.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.198
Yeah.

14:36.842 --> 14:38.901
Whoever killed Paul Beane
came after you next.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.875
You were wounded,
but you managed to escape.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.037
I'm not answering questions
until I see a lawyer.

14:43.215 --> 14:46.275
We should kick you out on the street.
Give them a chance to finish the job.

14:46.452 --> 14:48.249
Or work with us,
figure out who killed Paul.

14:48.420 --> 14:51.116
- What makes you think I care?
- You were partners.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.457
That doesn't mean anything.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.356
Just a man and a woman with guns
drifting from case to case.

14:57.896 --> 14:59.261
That it?

14:59.998 --> 15:01.932
Most partners
seek a higher meaning.

15:02.101 --> 15:03.898
It helps them get through
each day together.

15:06.772 --> 15:08.740
I don't know who killed Paul.

15:09.808 --> 15:11.867
And I don't know
who came after me.

15:12.077 --> 15:14.375
- You get a look at the shooters?
- It happened fast.

15:14.580 --> 15:16.775
They wore hockey masks.
Black ones.

15:16.982 --> 15:18.279
Why would they want you dead?

15:20.886 --> 15:22.183
Paul turned down a job.

15:23.822 --> 15:26.916
Payoff was too big.
It made him nervous.

15:27.493 --> 15:30.121
He said it involved military hardware.
Something serious.

15:30.596 --> 15:33.588
So I told the rest of the guys
to walk away from it.

15:33.765 --> 15:37.098
Military hardware's gotta be
the connection to Camp Pendleton.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.798
Maybe that's where they started
in the first place.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.635
How long were you two
seeing each other?

15:51.116 --> 15:52.845
How did you know?

16:00.526 --> 16:01.788
Wedding ring.

16:03.695 --> 16:06.823
Sometimes Paul wore it,
sometimes he didn't.

16:07.933 --> 16:11.300
I figured he was seeing someone
who wasn't his wife.

16:14.573 --> 16:17.633
Paul's marriage was falling apart.

16:17.843 --> 16:20.505
None of the guys I dated got what I did
for a living like he did.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.079
- Anyone else know?
- No.

16:24.216 --> 16:28.209
After the accident, it changed him.

16:30.155 --> 16:32.180
He went to this dark place.

16:32.391 --> 16:35.326
He used his connections to start
the California Gold Taxi Service.

16:37.829 --> 16:38.989
And you helped him.

16:42.000 --> 16:44.161
I couldn't sell the house.

16:47.973 --> 16:50.874
My mom's medical bills
were adding up, and...

17:00.118 --> 17:01.244
I wanna help you.

17:06.992 --> 17:11.088
Call your California Gold crew,
put out the word.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.395
You got scared into taking the job.

17:14.566 --> 17:16.396
Officers Exley and Powell
are gonna handle it.

17:37.089 --> 17:38.454
How are you boys tonight?

17:38.657 --> 17:43.720
As far as I'm concerned,
any night off-duty is a good night.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.055
Half-off drinks.

17:45.964 --> 17:47.522
But not tips.

17:49.735 --> 17:50.759
He's buying.

18:03.048 --> 18:04.538
You bummed
you're stuck here with me?

18:05.117 --> 18:07.642
No, it's for the best.

18:07.819 --> 18:10.253
I can't go undercover in places
like this anymore.

18:10.422 --> 18:13.152
All the dancers know and love me.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.657
Must be your dashing personality.

18:15.827 --> 18:17.351
Well, it's not my money.

18:17.562 --> 18:19.689
- Right.
- I have mystique.

18:20.766 --> 18:23.326
By "mystique," I don't mean
the brunette dancer inside the bar,

18:23.502 --> 18:24.560
real name Kimberly.

18:24.770 --> 18:27.295
Yay, congratulations. A go-go dancer
told you her real name.

18:27.472 --> 18:29.599
Patience, Kensi.

18:30.575 --> 18:32.372
And by "patience,"
I don't mean the redhead

18:32.577 --> 18:35.546
that goes on at 10:00 tonight,
real name Jessica.

18:37.149 --> 18:39.344
- What?
- That might be our guy right there,

18:39.518 --> 18:42.351
chatting up the bouncer.
Frat-boy looks.

18:42.587 --> 18:44.111
Flashy gold watch.

18:44.289 --> 18:46.655
Sam, Callen,
I think we got eyes on our man.

18:47.159 --> 18:49.525
He's on his way in.

18:49.728 --> 18:51.821
Got him, Deeks.

18:57.302 --> 18:59.634
He's got an entourage.

19:10.482 --> 19:11.847
I'm Steve Brenner.

19:13.518 --> 19:15.850
- Exley.
- Powell.

19:16.054 --> 19:18.921
California Gold Taxi Service
speaks very highly of you two.

19:20.125 --> 19:21.251
Never heard of it.

19:23.628 --> 19:25.653
Heard you were asking
about Jennifer Grear

19:25.831 --> 19:28.391
at the CHP motor pool earlier today.

19:28.633 --> 19:31.193
Her old partner
was murdered this morning.

19:31.370 --> 19:33.770
- Paul Beane.
- Never heard of him.

19:34.005 --> 19:36.565
Sounds like we're running out of things
to talk about.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.266
Maybe you should leave
before things get awkward.

19:39.444 --> 19:41.207
We're in a bikini bar.

19:43.048 --> 19:44.572
No such thing as awkward.

19:54.393 --> 19:55.417
Hear me out.

19:55.961 --> 19:57.258
You got ten seconds.

19:58.864 --> 20:03.631
Nine, eight, seven, six...

20:03.802 --> 20:06.737
I need a couple of CHP cops
to pull off a job.

20:06.905 --> 20:09.931
- Word is you two don't scare easily.
- What's the pay?

20:10.175 --> 20:12.575
Fifty grand. Each.

20:15.680 --> 20:16.772
What do we gotta do?

20:16.982 --> 20:19.815
Black Range Rover driving
to Los Angeles from Vegas tomorrow.

20:19.985 --> 20:22.613
Fire up some flares.
Create a roadblock. Pull the driver out.

20:22.788 --> 20:26.781
Give him a ticket.
Take him in for resisting arrest.

20:26.992 --> 20:28.983
Once he's locked up, you get paid.

20:29.227 --> 20:31.889
- What's his name?
- Not important.

20:32.097 --> 20:35.692
You want us to arrest the right guy,
we're gonna need a name.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.837
Phil Crombie. Ex-con.

20:40.005 --> 20:41.063
Business rival of mine.

20:41.239 --> 20:43.764
I need him off the street
so I can complete a deal.

20:46.611 --> 20:48.636
What if we say no?

20:49.581 --> 20:52.778
Ask Paul Beane and Jennifer Grear
how that worked out for them.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.514
We're in.

21:02.360 --> 21:04.294
Be in touch, gentlemen.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.961
He didn't mention
military hardware or Pendleton.

21:12.871 --> 21:14.338
What's this really about?

21:14.539 --> 21:17.269
Sounds like we're about to find out.

21:27.685 --> 21:29.949
Took these at the club
last night. Recognize them?

21:30.154 --> 21:33.385
- None of these guys are CHP.
- They the ones that came after you?

21:33.624 --> 21:35.251
They wore hockey masks.
Could be them.

21:35.459 --> 21:36.551
Could be someone else.

21:36.961 --> 21:38.690
You regret getting involved now?

21:38.863 --> 21:41.855
The State's running out of money.
CHP's broke.

21:42.032 --> 21:44.398
You got good cops being forced
into early retirement.

21:44.568 --> 21:46.365
There's no such thing
as overtime anymore.

21:46.537 --> 21:48.698
- We didn't think it would come to this.
- But it did.

21:48.873 --> 21:53.242
Look, I'm not proud
of the California Gold Taxi Service,

21:53.410 --> 21:56.004
but guys were losing their houses.

22:00.784 --> 22:02.274
Yeah.

22:02.853 --> 22:04.582
I regret it.

22:05.289 --> 22:06.847
I think Paul regretted it too.

22:08.926 --> 22:11.190
Tell us more about the guys
that tried to kill you.

22:11.395 --> 22:14.228
They're good. Trained.

22:14.398 --> 22:16.332
- Like cops?
- Like military.

22:18.002 --> 22:21.870
So "Steve Brenner" is an alias.
His real name is Justin Marchetti.

22:22.072 --> 22:24.336
Did nine years in prison
for running a Ponzi scheme.

22:24.542 --> 22:26.669
Some people thought
he was Wall Street's savant

22:26.844 --> 22:29.813
until $20 million
of his clients' money disappeared.

22:30.014 --> 22:32.346
Mostly retirement funds
and life savings.

22:32.516 --> 22:35.041
His buddies are all
former French military.

22:35.252 --> 22:38.050
- GIGN.
- It's an elite counter-terrorist unit.

22:38.255 --> 22:40.189
Their services don't come cheap.

22:40.624 --> 22:43.593
What do we have on Phil Crombie,
the guy Marchetti wants us to stop?

22:43.761 --> 22:46.753
He did a dime in Folsom
for drug trafficking.

22:46.931 --> 22:48.091
Released last year.

22:48.332 --> 22:50.459
Currently employed by a restaurant
in Santa Monica.

22:50.634 --> 22:53.432
What, he graduated from narcotics
to military hardware?

22:55.539 --> 22:56.597
It's gotta be Marchetti.

22:58.108 --> 22:59.439
Ready to start the trace.

23:00.711 --> 23:01.735
Peter Exley.

23:01.912 --> 23:04.312
The Range Rover
will be passing Marker 447

23:04.481 --> 23:06.949
on Route 138 at exactly 4 p.m.

23:07.151 --> 23:10.882
- You sure Crombie's onboard?
- He's driving. Don't screw it up.

23:11.789 --> 23:15.555
No. He's using an encrypted satphone.
Not even close.

23:15.726 --> 23:18.854
We need to figure out if we're dealing
with narcotics or military hardware.

23:19.063 --> 23:21.122
Go back to Paul's garage,
see if anything turns up.

23:21.298 --> 23:24.096
- We're on it.
- I queried officials at Camp Pendleton

23:24.268 --> 23:26.361
and numerous agencies.

23:26.570 --> 23:30.666
There is no other operation in play
at this time.

23:30.908 --> 23:33.001
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna.

23:34.812 --> 23:38.771
We still don't know
what we're getting ourselves into here.

23:39.483 --> 23:40.950
Please be careful.

23:51.595 --> 23:54.587
Hopefully this guy Crombie
can fill in some of the blanks.

23:57.801 --> 23:59.894
Black Range Rover. Here we go.

24:16.787 --> 24:18.118
License and registration.

24:30.034 --> 24:31.797
Got off the phone
with Phil Crombie's boss.

24:31.969 --> 24:33.231
He showed up at the restaurant.

24:33.470 --> 24:36.633
Callen, Sam, Crombie is not the one
in that Range Rover.

24:36.807 --> 24:38.741
- Sam.
- What's the problem, officer?

24:42.479 --> 24:44.071
Nothing personal.

25:21.819 --> 25:23.184
They're wearing body armor.

25:45.642 --> 25:47.940
- You okay?
- Vest took the hit.

25:48.112 --> 25:49.204
They're Marchetti's guys.

25:50.714 --> 25:53.148
- Don't you say it.
- You're welcome.

26:08.932 --> 26:10.797
Go, go, go!

26:11.568 --> 26:13.900
Let's go, let's go!

26:21.812 --> 26:23.336
- Move it!
- Go!

27:20.337 --> 27:22.931
ID card from
the Department of Energy.

27:23.874 --> 27:27.071
Shooters used plastic explosives
to level your bikes.

27:27.244 --> 27:29.178
Probably think the blast
finished you guys off.

27:29.379 --> 27:32.348
- Where's the trailer?
- Tracked it with satellite imagery.

27:32.549 --> 27:34.813
Range Rover and trailer
were dumped a half-mile away.

27:35.018 --> 27:36.576
Found three more bodies.

27:36.753 --> 27:40.450
Department of Energy security detail
riding in back with the cargo.

27:40.690 --> 27:41.782
Department of Energy?

27:41.958 --> 27:44.756
Took all of ten minutes
for these guys to become ghosts.

27:44.928 --> 27:47.863
Found these scattered on the floor
of the Range Rover they left behind.

27:48.065 --> 27:49.123
Some kind of fruit.

27:51.268 --> 27:53.031
Candy-coated figs
from the Middle East.

27:53.236 --> 27:56.535
Doesn't track. Marchetti's guys
are French. They're not Arab.

27:56.740 --> 27:59.903
Counter-terrorist operatives
don't become Jihadists overnight.

28:03.713 --> 28:06.978
Hey. Uh, so Beane's garage
was a dead end.

28:07.484 --> 28:08.849
- You guys okay?
- Yeah.

28:09.052 --> 28:11.418
- Could you repeat that?
- Empty Quiver.

28:12.355 --> 28:14.152
Empty Quiver.

28:14.324 --> 28:15.484
- That's correct.
- Indeed.

28:17.160 --> 28:19.856
Empty Quiver,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:23.633 --> 28:26.830
- What does "Empty Quiver" mean?
- "Empty Quiver" is a Pentagon term.

28:27.003 --> 28:30.632
It refers to the loss or theft
of a functioning nuclear weapon.

28:30.874 --> 28:32.307
They stole a nuke?

28:34.411 --> 28:36.777
What, DOE just decided
to take it on a road trip?

28:36.947 --> 28:39.609
They ship trailers like this across
the highways every day.

28:39.783 --> 28:41.114
The idea is to be low profile.

28:41.284 --> 28:44.412
They're unmarked and manned
by former Special Forces operators.

28:44.621 --> 28:47.681
No one's been any the wiser
until today.

28:47.924 --> 28:51.826
The trailer contains a warhead
en route to refurbishment.

28:51.995 --> 28:53.485
We were not informed

28:53.663 --> 28:56.291
because of the sensitive nature
of the cargo.

28:56.800 --> 28:59.530
- What's the yield?
- A hundred kilotons.

29:00.604 --> 29:04.335
Five times the power
of the one that leveled Hiroshima.

29:04.508 --> 29:06.669
And how is the Department of Energy
handling this?

29:06.843 --> 29:08.003
Discretely.

29:08.211 --> 29:10.338
If the media discovered,
it would be panic.

29:10.547 --> 29:13.846
Nuclear Emergency Support Teams
have been deployed

29:14.017 --> 29:17.282
to scour the area
for its radioactive signature.

29:17.454 --> 29:20.287
If these guys wanted to set off a nuke,
why haven't they done it?

29:20.457 --> 29:23.290
You need a nuclear physicist to arm it
and trigger the detonation.

29:23.994 --> 29:27.225
Mr. Callen, Mr. Hanna, a word.

29:30.634 --> 29:32.158
The blame game has begun.

29:32.802 --> 29:36.329
High-level officials interested
in covering their own asses.

29:36.506 --> 29:41.534
They're demanding to know
why the two NCIS agents on the scene

29:41.711 --> 29:44.373
weren't able to prevent the incident.

29:44.548 --> 29:48.143
The word "investigation"
has already been bandied about.

29:48.351 --> 29:50.376
It's pretty meaningless
given what's at stake.

29:50.587 --> 29:52.248
And politicking isn't our job.

29:52.489 --> 29:55.049
Oh, no, Mr. Hanna, it's mine.

29:55.258 --> 29:57.886
- You don't have to protect us.
- Oh, yes, I do.

29:58.061 --> 30:00.325
And I've feared for years
that a day would come

30:00.497 --> 30:04.331
when I wouldn't be able to.
I hope this isn't it.

30:04.534 --> 30:05.967
There is only one solution:

30:06.169 --> 30:09.161
Recover the warhead
before it can be used.

30:12.375 --> 30:15.003
We just received a video.

30:22.586 --> 30:24.349
White House received this
five minutes ago.

30:24.521 --> 30:26.853
They're keeping it under wraps.
Don't wanna create panic.

30:27.023 --> 30:28.081
There's the warhead.

30:28.258 --> 30:30.192
Says "Pan-Islamic Brotherhood"
in Arabic.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.555
- Never heard of them.
- Neither have I.

30:33.129 --> 30:36.621
I'm Dr. Delia Richards.

30:36.800 --> 30:39.132
I'm a nuclear physicist.

30:40.403 --> 30:44.567
These men have a nuclear warhead
in their possession.

30:45.875 --> 30:47.934
They're forcing me to arm it.

30:58.455 --> 31:01.822
"Judgment Day has arrived.

31:02.058 --> 31:05.255
In three hours, the American people

31:05.428 --> 31:10.229
will feel the fear of not knowing
who will die or when."

31:10.433 --> 31:12.333
Three hours from now is 6:30 a.m.

31:13.169 --> 31:15.137
Video doesn't specify a target.

31:15.338 --> 31:18.136
- Nell. Dr. Delia Richards?
- Mm-hm.

31:19.609 --> 31:22.043
Okay.

31:22.245 --> 31:23.769
Employed by Golden State Tech.

31:23.947 --> 31:26.677
Formerly employed
by Trecdel Electronics.

31:26.916 --> 31:28.281
The weapons manufacturer.

31:28.485 --> 31:30.350
Worked in R&D
at their Maryland plant.

31:30.553 --> 31:31.577
Cutting-edge tech.

31:31.755 --> 31:34.656
She was originally recruited by the
Department of Energy out of school,

31:34.824 --> 31:36.985
but went private sector instead.

31:37.193 --> 31:40.822
Specialises in applied physics,
not theoretical. Which means...

31:41.064 --> 31:43.328
- She can arm the warhead.
- Must be why they chose her.

31:43.500 --> 31:47.095
Since when do Wall Street guys
start working with Wahhabi Muslims?

31:47.270 --> 31:50.364
Marchetti's guys don't match
the profile for martyrs.

31:50.573 --> 31:51.665
Something's off.

31:52.275 --> 31:53.537
Tell Golden State Tech security

31:53.710 --> 31:56.372
we're gonna need full access
to Dr. Richards' office.

31:56.613 --> 31:58.877
I checked
it out. Nothing on NEST sensors.

31:59.082 --> 32:00.106
Signs of struggle.

32:00.317 --> 32:01.978
- I'll keep looking.
- Thanks, Eric.

32:02.152 --> 32:03.710
NEST teams are drawing a blank.

32:03.953 --> 32:05.682
A nuke signature
has to be more radioactive

32:05.855 --> 32:08.449
than everything around it
or detection equipment can't find it.

32:08.658 --> 32:10.888
L.A.'s filled with things
that would throw sensors off:

32:11.094 --> 32:12.789
Buildings, vehicles, even people.

32:12.996 --> 32:16.022
So, what's the best way to transport
a nuke without getting caught?

32:16.232 --> 32:17.824
Bananas.

32:18.601 --> 32:19.829
Lots of bananas.

32:20.036 --> 32:22.869
Bananas are high in potassium.
Potassium is radioactive.

32:23.039 --> 32:25.701
If I was hiding a nuke,
I'd hide it in a truckload full of them.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.843
Fooling the sensor
by creating a false positive.

32:28.011 --> 32:30.707
- One look inside, they'll wave it along.
- Sam.

32:36.219 --> 32:37.550
Two radiuses.

32:37.721 --> 32:40.713
The first one measures a blast
originating in downtown L.A.

32:40.924 --> 32:44.325
The second one measures the effects
of a nuclear fallout.

32:44.527 --> 32:46.017
- We need to tell Hetty.
- No.

32:46.663 --> 32:49.029
- Not yet.
- What?

32:49.199 --> 32:51.429
Hetty will have to inform
the Pentagon.

32:51.634 --> 32:53.067
They'll start to evacuate the city.

32:54.070 --> 32:55.935
What if that's
exactly what Marchetti wants?

32:56.539 --> 32:59.633
Guys who are capable of pulling off
a hijacking operation like that

32:59.843 --> 33:01.674
don't accidentally forget their maps.

33:02.145 --> 33:04.375
Yeah, classic misdirection.

33:05.382 --> 33:07.873
Okay, so if we're right,
the last thing we have to worry about

33:08.051 --> 33:11.077
is an attack in Los Angeles
in two hours and 11 minutes.

33:13.189 --> 33:14.349
What if we're wrong?

33:25.668 --> 33:28.034
Delia Richards?
I don't know that name.

33:30.473 --> 33:31.497
I've seen her.

33:32.508 --> 33:33.566
At a bar.

33:33.809 --> 33:35.970
A month ago,
she wanted to meet to talk about

33:36.145 --> 33:39.137
a potential
California Gold Taxi Service job.

33:39.315 --> 33:41.579
I drove Paul to meet her.
Waited in the car outside.

33:41.817 --> 33:44.843
- You sure it was her?
- Paul and I were sleeping together.

33:45.054 --> 33:48.751
He meets up with a woman
that looks like this, I take notice.

33:48.924 --> 33:51.484
- He say what the job was about?
- No.

33:51.660 --> 33:55.096
But whatever it was, it shook him up.
He wouldn't give me any details.

33:55.798 --> 33:59.495
He said that the woman
gave him stock tips.

33:59.668 --> 34:04.867
Told him to sell everything in his
portfolio and put it in gold and silver.

34:07.043 --> 34:09.204
We dug into
Delia Richards' finances.

34:09.378 --> 34:11.572
Over the past five years,
she made a small fortune

34:11.746 --> 34:13.408
in the stock market as a day trader.

34:13.581 --> 34:15.846
Her equities were handled
by an investment firm

34:16.018 --> 34:18.748
whose address is a P.O. Box
in the Cayman Islands.

34:19.388 --> 34:20.616
Now, it's rented by a woman

34:20.856 --> 34:23.085
who used to work
for Justin Marchetti's old hedge fund.

34:23.259 --> 34:25.420
What's the connection
between a day-trading physicist,

34:25.594 --> 34:28.427
an ex-con money manager,
and a stolen nuke?

34:28.630 --> 34:33.625
You found a map of Los Angeles
with nuclear-blast radiuses marked off,

34:33.869 --> 34:35.837
and you kept it from me?

34:36.038 --> 34:39.768
I made a judgment call. If we told you,
you would've been bound to report it

34:39.942 --> 34:42.376
- to the Pentagon.
- I'm the one who decides

34:42.545 --> 34:46.413
whether or not we fulfill
these obligations, Mr. Callen.

34:46.581 --> 34:48.641
I don't need your protection.

34:48.884 --> 34:52.081
- I need your trust.
- And I need your help.

34:52.288 --> 34:56.088
- Marchetti is trying to play us.
- To what end?

34:56.292 --> 34:59.159
That's exactly what we were
just about to ask you.

35:00.262 --> 35:02.423
Video said something's
gonna happen at 6:30 a.m.

35:02.598 --> 35:04.065
That's one hour from now.

35:04.233 --> 35:06.793
- What happens at that time in L. A?
- Start of rush hour.

35:07.002 --> 35:10.460
A better question may be,
what happens on the East Coast,

35:10.639 --> 35:13.073
where it'll be 9:30 a. M?

35:16.245 --> 35:19.373
The New York Stock Exchange
opens for trading.

35:20.382 --> 35:23.283
Terrorist attacks cause panic.

35:23.452 --> 35:27.320
In times of panic,
people sell off their stocks.

35:27.490 --> 35:30.186
The market plummets.
What happened on 9/11?

35:30.392 --> 35:31.916
Everyone dumped
their airline stocks.

35:32.094 --> 35:36.121
But a small group of people
sold their airline shares short

35:36.298 --> 35:38.459
the day before and made a fortune.

35:38.634 --> 35:41.102
Marchetti's got a terrorist attack
at his fingertips.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.931
He doesn't even have
to detonate the nuke.

35:43.105 --> 35:45.665
The threat alone would be enough
to crash the market.

35:45.841 --> 35:48.708
If the public even thinks
Jihadists stole that warhead,

35:48.911 --> 35:50.469
it'll cause mass hysteria.

35:50.679 --> 35:54.206
- Well, the video hasn't gone wide yet.
- And the man isn't a Jihadist.

35:54.416 --> 36:00.286
He's sitting on inside information
that could make him billions.

36:00.456 --> 36:02.856
All he has to do
is release that video,

36:03.058 --> 36:05.652
sit back and watch the market
do his bidding.

36:05.828 --> 36:08.388
It would be like the real-estate crash
all over again.

36:08.564 --> 36:11.727
Except it will be every business,
all on the same day at the same time.

36:15.538 --> 36:16.562
Yes, Eric?

36:16.739 --> 36:18.866
We found what we
were looking for on Marchetti.

36:19.041 --> 36:21.032
- You guys need to look at this.
- Bingo.

36:24.013 --> 36:26.004
Dug up all real-estate holdings
on Steve Brenner,

36:26.182 --> 36:27.240
a.k.a. Justin Marchetti.

36:27.449 --> 36:30.077
Last month, he acquired a factory
called Festive Ceramics.

36:30.319 --> 36:31.752
They produce dishes and plates.

36:31.954 --> 36:35.355
Paint used on ceramics
contains high amounts of uranium,

36:35.524 --> 36:37.321
harmless but highly radioactive.

36:37.493 --> 36:39.222
And any factory using it registers

36:39.395 --> 36:41.659
off the charts in the eyes
of the detection equipment.

36:41.830 --> 36:43.764
Marchetti created a false positive.

36:43.966 --> 36:45.661
The perfect smokescreen
to hide the nuke.

36:45.834 --> 36:48.325
There's not much time until
the New York Stock Exchange opens.

36:48.504 --> 36:50.096
We need to move
on that factory now.

36:50.272 --> 36:52.263
Shooters that hijacked that trailer
will be there.

36:52.508 --> 36:53.907
Anything we should know
about them?

36:54.076 --> 36:56.237
They're not the type to stop
when you yell, "Freeze!"

36:56.412 --> 36:57.538
Mr. Callen.

36:59.081 --> 37:01.549
Lethal action has been authorized.

37:17.866 --> 37:19.026
Sentries are down.

37:49.565 --> 37:50.896
Very personal.

37:52.401 --> 37:54.301
You're welcome.

37:55.137 --> 37:57.731
Sam, someone just
accessed the video from this laptop.

37:57.906 --> 37:59.066
It could have been uploaded.

38:00.576 --> 38:02.271
I've got the mirroring app up
and running.

38:03.412 --> 38:05.004
What are you seeing, Eric?

38:05.180 --> 38:07.148
Video footage
hasn't been streamed anywhere yet,

38:07.316 --> 38:09.307
but they uploaded a copy
to a flash drive.

38:16.191 --> 38:18.125
Kensi, take them!

38:30.873 --> 38:33.933
- The driver and passenger are down.
- Seven down, one man left.

38:34.109 --> 38:36.077
In there. Using the nuke for cover.

38:38.947 --> 38:40.505
Don't miss.

38:48.590 --> 38:51.184
Hetty, Empty Quiver is secure.

38:55.597 --> 38:58.191
- Need to stop this video, Eric.
- Video's already in the cloud.

38:58.367 --> 39:01.029
The auto-run script executable
is about to go live.

39:01.236 --> 39:03.704
- I'm almost there.
- Eric?

39:07.676 --> 39:09.303
Video has been disabled, guys.

39:11.180 --> 39:13.375
What did you just do?

39:13.549 --> 39:16.382
I used a VNC controller to piggyback
the upload with a Trojan

39:16.618 --> 39:21.055
and corrupt the streaming data packets
by initiating a stack buffer overflow.

39:21.223 --> 39:23.020
In English, Mr. Beale?

39:23.225 --> 39:25.125
Oh, I broke the Internet.

39:32.835 --> 39:35.269
- Help me!
- You okay?

39:35.504 --> 39:37.836
Drop it.

39:40.175 --> 39:43.406
Sorry, it ain't over yet.

39:43.579 --> 39:45.547
Okay.

39:51.086 --> 39:54.055
You know, you're gonna have trouble
shooting me with that safety on.

39:55.758 --> 39:57.555
That's gonna leave a mark.
Get over there.

40:00.596 --> 40:02.587
I got a question for you.

40:02.798 --> 40:06.734
Is it true all Wall Street guys are born
losers and get rich to compensate?

40:06.902 --> 40:09.632
- Well...
- No, that's rhetorical. You're a loser.

40:09.805 --> 40:11.796
And you?

40:12.040 --> 40:14.406
You looked a lot better on camera,
sweetheart.

40:18.313 --> 40:20.372
Aw...

40:24.253 --> 40:26.619
Oh, hey, guys.
What did Eric do with the video?

40:26.789 --> 40:28.051
Shut down the Internet.

40:28.924 --> 40:30.391
What? The whole Internet?

40:30.559 --> 40:31.992
- Yeah.
- Even Twitter?

40:37.266 --> 40:41.396
- What happens now?
- CHP has taken over the case.

40:41.570 --> 40:43.401
It's not our call.

40:44.106 --> 40:45.733
But they know you helped us.

40:47.776 --> 40:51.007
Did you get him?
The guy who killed Paul?

40:51.246 --> 40:52.304
We got him.

41:32.488 --> 41:35.685
So turns out Marchetti
was paying off an Intelligence officer

41:35.858 --> 41:37.792
at Camp Pendleton.
That's how he knew the route

41:37.960 --> 41:39.052
the warhead was taking.

41:39.261 --> 41:40.990
It makes sense.

41:41.163 --> 41:45.259
Nell, is it true that you describe Kensi
as hilarious?

41:45.467 --> 41:46.764
I'm sorry, what?

41:53.509 --> 41:56.569
- You don't remember that time?
- Uh, what time?

41:57.913 --> 42:00.541
The time that... Nell, come on. I...

42:00.716 --> 42:02.343
The time.

42:02.518 --> 42:07.217
Oh, right. That time. Of course.

42:07.389 --> 42:10.290
It was funny be...
It was funny because...

42:15.230 --> 42:17.596
I was just replaying it in my head,
and it was just...

42:24.506 --> 42:26.906
Oh. Great.

42:30.445 --> 42:35.610
In the future, I will, uh...
I will try to take things more seriously.

42:41.356 --> 42:44.587
I... I will try and lighten up.

42:46.862 --> 42:48.625
I'd like that.

42:49.898 --> 42:51.763
I would like that too.

42:53.235 --> 42:57.035
- Do me a favor, though?
- Yeah.

42:57.973 --> 42:59.372
Don't ever laugh like that again.

43:01.543 --> 43:02.908
It was terrifying.
