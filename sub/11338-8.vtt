00:17.934 --> 00:19.367
now,
from these experiments,

00:19.434 --> 00:21.434
A few factors became evident.

00:21.501 --> 00:22.868
One was the realization

00:22.934 --> 00:24.868
That serial killers
have been with us

00:24.934 --> 00:26.200
Since the dawn of man.

00:26.267 --> 00:27.567
Please, let him go.

00:27.634 --> 00:29.367
Take whatever you want,
take anything,

00:29.434 --> 00:31.033
But please let my son go.

00:31.100 --> 00:33.133
My name is
professor James Fallon.

00:33.200 --> 00:35.734
I'm a scientist--
neuroscientist--

00:35.801 --> 00:37.400
And I study the human brain.

00:37.467 --> 00:41.100
It is a complex
and sometimes lethal machine.

00:41.167 --> 00:42.734
In a blind experiment,
colleagues sent me

00:42.801 --> 00:44.400
70 MRI brain scans,

00:44.467 --> 00:47.367
And I had no idea
who these brains belonged to.

00:47.434 --> 00:49.234
Some were normals,
some were schizophrenics,

00:49.300 --> 00:51.400
And some were killers.

00:51.467 --> 00:52.901
I analysed all of them,

00:52.968 --> 00:57.067
5 of which I determined
were the brains of psychopaths.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.634
And it turned out
that, indeed,

00:58.701 --> 01:01.801
These 5 were the brains
of serial killers,

01:01.868 --> 01:03.434
Some of whom you know.

01:13.734 --> 01:15.767
In studies such as these,

01:15.834 --> 01:17.234
One looks at
the biological factors...

01:18.501 --> 01:20.834
That is, the genetics
and also the brain pathology.

01:20.901 --> 01:22.767
The 5 brains we identified

01:22.834 --> 01:25.400
All had damage
to the orbital cortex,

01:25.467 --> 01:27.100
Which is right above the eyes.

01:27.167 --> 01:30.400
Now, high-risk allele
of the mono amine oxidase a,

01:30.467 --> 01:32.434
The maoa gene

01:32.501 --> 01:34.434
May also be present
in these people,

01:34.501 --> 01:35.701
And that's key.

01:35.767 --> 01:37.434
Now, under the effects
of the high-risk gene,

01:37.501 --> 01:39.434
The brain of the psychopath
was bathed

01:39.501 --> 01:42.534
In way too much serotonin
during foetal development.

01:42.601 --> 01:44.701
As an adult,

01:44.767 --> 01:47.267
This brain is now numb

01:47.334 --> 01:50.300
To seratonin's calming effects.

01:50.367 --> 01:53.234
The first dangerous elements
are now in place.

01:53.300 --> 01:55.801
The damage is done.

01:55.868 --> 01:59.567
Now, this is a recipe
for catastrophe.

01:59.634 --> 02:02.501
So when the foetus reaches
the day of labour,

02:02.567 --> 02:05.200
The potential
serial killer is born.

02:09.567 --> 02:12.133
Mom! uhh--

02:12.200 --> 02:14.501
Mom!

03:12.100 --> 03:14.167
hey, how was your weekend?

03:14.234 --> 03:17.067
Uh, scary yet informative.
was the whole family killed?

03:17.133 --> 03:19.434
Hudson, this is
Dr. Spencer Reid.

03:19.501 --> 03:21.000
Field agent Anne Hudson.

03:21.067 --> 03:23.133
The, uh, father
is serving in Iraq.

03:23.200 --> 03:25.701
3 nights ago the cops found
his family buried over there.

03:25.767 --> 03:27.167
Buried?

03:27.234 --> 03:28.400
The neighbours heard
the dog barking, came over,

03:28.467 --> 03:29.801
And he was scratching
at the grave.

03:29.868 --> 03:32.934
Lucy, their oldest child,
she's still in her swimsuit.

03:33.000 --> 03:34.200
What does the father know?

03:34.267 --> 03:35.968
some of it.
he was on patrol.

03:36.033 --> 03:38.200
Took his unit a couple
of days to reach him.

03:38.267 --> 03:39.434
He arrives today.

03:39.501 --> 03:40.701
Last year
the Williams family

03:40.767 --> 03:42.634
Was killed and found
exactly the same way.

03:42.701 --> 03:44.834
They lived in Newport news.

03:44.901 --> 03:46.701
The father, Dan Williams,
was also serving overseas.

03:46.767 --> 03:48.534
Now, the police
are overwhelmed

03:48.601 --> 03:50.534
And getting serious heat
from the military.

03:50.601 --> 03:51.767
We need some answers fast.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.033
as do the media.

03:53.100 --> 03:55.267
They're already calling this
the work of a serial killer.

03:55.334 --> 03:57.000
They're right. it is.

03:57.067 --> 03:58.167
But why bury them?

03:58.234 --> 04:00.667
I mean, it can't be
to hide the bodies.

04:00.734 --> 04:02.601
it's a sign of remorse.

04:02.667 --> 04:04.534
And when they're done
being remorseful,

04:04.601 --> 04:07.667
This will happen again.

"man usually avoids
attributing cleverness
to somebody else,

05:03.433 --> 05:05.467
Unless it's an enemy."

05:05.534 --> 05:07.634
Albert Einstein.

05:10.700 --> 05:12.400
no sign of a struggle.

05:12.467 --> 05:16.333
Unsub holds a gun
to one of her kids' head.

05:16.400 --> 05:18.867
What can she do?

05:18.934 --> 05:20.567
Footprints belong to Paul.

05:20.634 --> 05:22.801
Somehow he managed to get away.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.801
Mom gets it first,
then the youngest.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.801
He hides in the master bedroom,

05:27.867 --> 05:29.867
The unsub finds him
and shoots him.

05:29.934 --> 05:32.268
And carries him out
to the backyard.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.034
But not the mother.
she's dragged out.

05:35.101 --> 05:37.400
It's quick and proficient.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.400
For the mother
and the boys, maybe.

05:39.467 --> 05:41.634
But Lucy's drowned
and not shot.

05:41.700 --> 05:43.600
Why the change in m.o.?

05:50.234 --> 05:51.601
f-22 raptor.

05:51.668 --> 05:55.467
Yeah. it's about to get
way louder and much busier.

05:55.534 --> 05:59.134
Tomorrow is Langley's
50th anniversary air show.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.000
The father of the first
family killed--Dan Williams,

06:02.067 --> 06:03.501
Where is he now?

06:03.567 --> 06:05.000
He put in for another tour
of Iraq.

06:05.067 --> 06:08.100
An i.e.d. killed him
2 months ago.

06:08.167 --> 06:09.668
Whoever did this

06:09.734 --> 06:11.334
Knew both fathers
were serving overseas.

06:11.401 --> 06:13.267
Laura Downey's wedding rings
are missing.

06:13.334 --> 06:14.634
Any other valuables?

06:14.701 --> 06:16.067
We'll have to ask the husband.

06:16.134 --> 06:17.467
From the Williams home,

06:17.534 --> 06:19.167
Only jewellery and watches
were missing.

06:19.234 --> 06:21.000
The unsub only took
what he can carry,

06:21.067 --> 06:22.668
Which means he's most
likely on foot.

06:22.734 --> 06:24.067
There was a photo
on the wall in the kitchen.

06:24.134 --> 06:25.267
I'd like to see it.

06:25.334 --> 06:26.200
Sure.

06:26.267 --> 06:27.267
There's no sign
of sexual assault

06:27.334 --> 06:28.768
In the Williams case.
what about Lucy?

06:28.833 --> 06:30.734
Nothing on
the coroner's report.

06:30.800 --> 06:31.967
Multiple suspects?

06:32.034 --> 06:33.833
The mother was dragged
out of the house.

06:33.900 --> 06:34.967
If it had been
multiple suspects,

06:35.034 --> 06:36.067
They probably would have
carried her.

06:36.134 --> 06:37.301
He knew the father
was absent,

06:37.367 --> 06:38.800
Therefore the dominant
threat was absent.

06:38.867 --> 06:40.900
So we could be looking
for a single suspect.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.734
No sign of forced entry.

06:42.800 --> 06:43.967
No need.
Lucy was in the pool,

06:44.034 --> 06:46.601
Back door was open.
the unsub walked right in.

06:46.668 --> 06:47.800
That means Lucy
probably died last.

06:47.867 --> 06:49.367
In both cases the girls
were suffocated

06:49.434 --> 06:51.434
And not shot.
I don't think
it's a coincidence.

06:52.434 --> 06:53.567
Hey, Garcia.
you're on speaker.

06:53.634 --> 06:54.967
We just got a call

06:55.034 --> 06:56.567
From Virginia
super max prison.

06:56.634 --> 06:57.900
One of the inmates there

06:57.967 --> 07:00.768
Has received 2 envelopes
in the last 2 days.

07:00.833 --> 07:03.668
First envelope had clippings
of the Newport news killings.

07:03.734 --> 07:06.334
Second envelope had media
clippings of the Downey family.

07:06.401 --> 07:08.534
In the second envelope
was a note saying,

07:08.601 --> 07:10.401
"look at what I've done,"
and both pieces of mail

07:10.467 --> 07:11.601
Have been signed by
"an admirer."

07:11.668 --> 07:13.034
Who's the inmate?

07:13.100 --> 07:15.334
That's the part that...

07:16.167 --> 07:17.567
Karl Arnold.

07:17.634 --> 07:19.401
The fox?
- he's back.

07:19.467 --> 07:20.634
OK, thanks.

07:20.701 --> 07:23.467
Family annihilator,
absent father,
wedding rings.

07:23.534 --> 07:25.167
It's similar.

07:25.234 --> 07:26.167
To what?

07:26.234 --> 07:27.967
4 years ago, Karl Arnold,
aka the fox,

07:28.034 --> 07:29.534
Killed 8 families.

07:29.601 --> 07:30.734
Just like this case,
he took wedding rings,

07:30.800 --> 07:31.900
Only he took them
as trophies.

07:31.967 --> 07:35.301
he'd hide in the bushes
outside the homes.

07:35.367 --> 07:39.000
And I watched them...
for a number of days.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.967
Always at night.

07:41.833 --> 07:44.800
Saw how they lived...

07:44.867 --> 07:46.167
How they loved.

07:46.234 --> 07:50.301
I would keep them apart
until the last night.

07:50.367 --> 07:53.301
Then I would bring them,
one by one,

07:53.367 --> 07:54.734
Down to the basement,

07:54.800 --> 07:57.501
The youngest first.

07:57.567 --> 07:59.467
The father last.

07:59.534 --> 08:01.567
Why, Karl?

08:01.634 --> 08:04.434
So he could see
what happens...

08:04.501 --> 08:07.200
To families

08:07.267 --> 08:10.134
When the head of household
isn't strong.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.601
Wives wither...

08:16.668 --> 08:18.501
Children perish.

08:18.567 --> 08:21.434
So, we're working with
a copycat here?

08:21.501 --> 08:22.833
It's too early
to assume anything.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.334
It could bias the profile.

08:24.401 --> 08:26.900
Not to mention the police,
the media, and the military

08:26.967 --> 08:28.534
Would jump all over it.

08:28.601 --> 08:30.933
Until we're positive,
none of this information
leaves the 7 of us.

08:31.000 --> 08:33.333
Hotch, you gave evidence
at Arnold's trial.

08:33.400 --> 08:35.000
I think you should go see him.

08:35.067 --> 08:36.366
I'd like to take
Prentiss with me.

08:36.433 --> 08:37.799
Let's go.

08:37.866 --> 08:39.534
Have Garcia check on
all of Arnold's prison
correspondence

08:39.601 --> 08:41.134
And visitors for
the last 4 years.

08:41.200 --> 08:46.100
OK. captain Joseph Downey
has arrived back at the station.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.301
captain Downey,
please, sit.

08:49.367 --> 08:51.833
Thank you, I'm fine.

08:53.467 --> 08:55.501
Tell me everything.

08:56.900 --> 09:01.067
At around 9:30
3 nights ago,

09:01.134 --> 09:04.167
Your neighbours called
police when...

09:05.867 --> 09:07.534
I'm sorry.

09:11.701 --> 09:13.800
Sir.

09:13.867 --> 09:17.467
We believe it was the work
of a serial killer.

09:19.034 --> 09:22.833
I'm sorry. my neighbours,
uh, jack and penny--

09:22.900 --> 09:24.567
Captain Downey...

09:24.634 --> 09:27.601
Your family was murdered.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.100
All of them.

09:30.601 --> 09:34.234
Is there someone
you'd like us to call?

09:34.301 --> 09:37.567
Uh, call, um--no, no.
I, uh...

09:37.634 --> 09:42.301
I--I'd like to go home now.

09:42.367 --> 09:44.601
Captain Downey.
captain Downey. captain d--

09:44.668 --> 09:45.601
OK.

09:45.668 --> 09:46.668
OK.

09:46.734 --> 09:48.501
I'm sorry.

09:48.567 --> 09:51.634
I'm so sorry.

10:14.000 --> 10:16.668
So why wait a year
to send Karl a note,

10:16.734 --> 10:18.234
Unless they were
communicating
the whole time?

10:18.301 --> 10:20.434
That's the first thing
we need to find out.

10:20.501 --> 10:21.768
But Karl has a big ego.

10:21.833 --> 10:25.267
He's gonna want to answer
a question with a question.

10:25.334 --> 10:27.034
The first thing
he's gonna want to know

10:27.100 --> 10:28.833
Is why I'm not wearing
my wedding ring.

10:28.900 --> 10:30.434
And then he will turn
his attention to you.

10:30.501 --> 10:33.467
So that's why you
brought me along.

10:33.534 --> 10:36.933
Your presence
will throw him off guard.

10:37.000 --> 10:39.668
Then he's gonna want
to describe to you
in graphic detail

10:39.734 --> 10:42.200
Every sexual act
he committed
with the families.

10:42.267 --> 10:43.701
To freak me out?

10:43.768 --> 10:45.301
To pull you into
his fantasy.

10:45.367 --> 10:46.401
Control, open on 16.

10:54.100 --> 10:55.933
Keep your eyes forward.

10:58.334 --> 11:00.933
More than anything,
he's going to want to see
the images of the children.

11:01.000 --> 11:02.534
We can't give him that.

11:02.601 --> 11:07.134
We have to give him something
or we'll get nothing from him.

11:07.200 --> 11:08.534
Come on!

11:14.434 --> 11:15.534
Isn't that, uh--

11:15.601 --> 11:17.668
Garrett pain.
that's reinforced glass.

11:17.734 --> 11:20.501
Easy for you to say.
he tore apart 14 women.

11:20.567 --> 11:22.200
open on 15.

11:23.401 --> 11:25.200
whoa, baby!

11:29.134 --> 11:30.367
Hello, Karl.

11:30.434 --> 11:33.234
Agent Hotchner.

11:34.467 --> 11:37.367
I wasn't informed
you were bring in a, uh...

11:40.234 --> 11:42.200
They just said two agents.

11:42.267 --> 11:43.200
This is agent--

11:43.267 --> 11:45.501
Emily...

11:45.567 --> 11:48.200
Prentiss.

11:48.267 --> 11:50.668
I know all about you.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.567
If this unsub's
copying the fox,

11:54.634 --> 11:56.767
Then we profile him
like the fox.

11:56.834 --> 11:00.000
Karl Arnold worked
as a psychologist's
assistant, right?

12:00.167 --> 12:01.668
Yeah. which made it easy
for him to watch, target,

12:01.734 --> 12:03.434
And learn about the victims
from a distance.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.267
Yeah, it also made him
hard to find.

12:05.334 --> 12:07.501
Like the fox,
our man here found a way

12:07.567 --> 12:08.701
To hide in plain sight.

12:08.768 --> 12:11.367
But he's pulling from
2 completely different units.

12:11.434 --> 12:13.867
Williams a medic,
Downey an army captain.

12:13.933 --> 12:16.301
Someone knew of that
military connection.

12:16.367 --> 12:19.234
Both families were attacked
within a month of the fathers
being deployed.

12:19.301 --> 12:20.800
Gave them time to settle in,

12:20.867 --> 12:23.267
Get comfortable that
the fathers weren't there.

12:23.334 --> 12:26.034
And once inside the home,
the fox would live
with the families

12:26.100 --> 12:27.301
And then become the father.

12:27.367 --> 12:28.701
But not this unsub.

12:28.768 --> 12:31.267
He just walked in
and dispensed
with the family.

12:31.334 --> 12:34.000
Living with them wasn't
part of the fantasy.

12:34.067 --> 12:35.434
agent Rossi.

12:35.501 --> 12:36.701
The picture you requested.

12:36.768 --> 12:39.434
Thanks to you, we pulled
some prints off it.

12:39.501 --> 12:41.867
And all the prints
were on Lucy.

12:41.933 --> 12:45.067
The bullet hit
the father dead centre.

12:45.134 --> 12:48.334
The prints match that
of the Newport news killings.

12:48.401 --> 12:49.833
It's the same killer.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.367
Family annihilators
like the fox,
they start with one victim.

12:52.434 --> 12:53.534
And once they feel capable,

12:53.601 --> 12:55.067
They move on
to a second victim.

12:55.134 --> 12:57.301
They don't start
with entire families.

12:57.367 --> 13:00.200
There are more victims.
we just haven't found them yet.

13:04.301 --> 13:06.368
Karl, it appears
you have a fan.

13:06.434 --> 13:08.667
Admirer.

13:08.734 --> 13:10.034
Not a fan.

13:10.101 --> 13:11.767
Big difference.
right?

13:11.834 --> 13:16.301
Is this the first time
you've been contacted
by your admirer?

13:21.834 --> 13:24.900
I have many fans.

13:24.967 --> 13:26.734
Even my own website.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.834
Don't you?

13:34.034 --> 13:35.368
You'd be astounded

13:35.434 --> 13:37.867
At some of the questions
they ask.

13:37.934 --> 13:39.401
I make a log
of all of them.

13:39.468 --> 13:40.767
Would you like
to read some?

13:40.834 --> 13:42.500
I would love to.

13:42.567 --> 13:44.201
You'd love to?

13:46.401 --> 13:48.767
Yes.

13:48.834 --> 13:50.468
Here.

13:50.533 --> 13:52.533
Look.

13:58.334 --> 13:59.267
Maybe later.

13:59.334 --> 14:02.734
Your admirer
is taking wedding rings,

14:02.800 --> 14:05.134
Just like you.

14:05.201 --> 14:07.101
But maybe not
for the same reason.

14:07.167 --> 14:08.934
Like how you took
all of mine.

14:29.401 --> 14:32.368
You took mine.

14:33.700 --> 14:38.001
But I see...
you lost yours.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.734
8 rings, 4 families.

14:40.800 --> 14:42.867
Or was it one ring
for each family?

14:42.934 --> 14:44.834
How'd you come
to lose your ring?

14:44.900 --> 14:46.734
wait, don't tell me.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.600
A casualty of the job.

14:48.667 --> 14:50.734
My job is what
put you in here.

14:50.800 --> 14:52.700
True.

14:54.267 --> 14:56.800
But then,
it's the children

14:56.867 --> 14:59.633
Who suffer most.
wouldn't you agree?

14:59.700 --> 15:01.533
You'd know more
about that than me.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.533
Which is why
you came to me.

15:07.767 --> 15:10.301
I can help you with that,
agent Hotchner.

15:10.368 --> 15:13.567
I certainly can.

15:15.700 --> 15:19.201
But I'll need to see
those photos.

15:22.967 --> 15:24.533
May I?

15:25.834 --> 15:27.001
A word?

15:27.067 --> 15:28.434
Is there a problem,
Emily?

15:28.500 --> 15:31.101
There's no problem, Karl.

15:40.134 --> 15:42.067
We cannot show him these.

15:43.134 --> 15:44.900
These images
will be his undoing

15:44.967 --> 15:46.468
And our way in.

15:46.533 --> 15:48.700
But they're not just images.

15:48.767 --> 15:50.567
That's exactly
what they are.

15:50.633 --> 15:52.600
We can't use Lucy
like that.

15:52.667 --> 15:56.334
It's a trade-off
we have to make.

15:56.401 --> 16:00.500
So, we are using
a dead 12-year-old girl
in a bathing suit

16:00.567 --> 16:04.034
As a bargaining chip?
for what?

16:04.101 --> 16:06.500
To him it's not
just a photograph.

16:06.567 --> 16:10.167
It's much, much more,
and we need to know what.

16:11.234 --> 16:14.301
Look, I'm...

16:14.368 --> 16:17.134
I've never done this
before.

16:17.201 --> 16:19.900
And you don't have to now.

16:23.934 --> 16:26.500
Yes, I do.

16:26.567 --> 16:29.468
All right. when I feel
he's ready to talk,

16:29.533 --> 16:30.867
I'll leave the room.

16:30.934 --> 16:32.633
You get him talking.

16:32.700 --> 16:37.167
Whatever he does,
whatever you feel,

16:37.234 --> 16:38.633
Just stay on script.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.967
We need to know why
he killed those families.

16:42.034 --> 16:43.967
he's had
a smattering of visits,

16:44.034 --> 16:46.234
A couple of whack jobs
contact him,

16:46.301 --> 16:47.900
But nothing as direct
as this admirer person.

16:47.967 --> 16:50.334
how are we doing
on the prints
on the picture?

16:50.401 --> 16:52.234
Oh. I'm still running them.

16:52.301 --> 16:54.001
How are you holding up?

16:54.067 --> 16:56.067
Military families,
they always fear the worst.

16:56.134 --> 16:57.967
They know their men
may not return,

16:58.034 --> 17:00.167
But this--

17:00.234 --> 17:01.834
To see a father
lose so much.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.233
I wish I had something
for you.

17:04.300 --> 17:06.267
I truly cannot find
a damn thing

17:06.334 --> 17:07.532
That connects these families.

17:07.599 --> 17:09.367
Geographically,
both of them

17:09.434 --> 17:11.401
Are thousands of miles
away from their family.

17:11.468 --> 17:12.867
Communication's
all they had--

17:12.934 --> 17:15.067
Emails, phone calls,
letters.

17:15.134 --> 17:16.967
But that's military
communication.

17:17.034 --> 17:19.666
Even between families,
it requires a kind of juice
I'm not allowed to use.

17:19.733 --> 17:22.666
Come on. you hacked
into the FBI database.

17:22.733 --> 17:23.867
And they gave me a job.

17:23.934 --> 17:25.034
And I like my job.

17:25.101 --> 17:26.532
And I like my life.

17:26.599 --> 17:28.101
All right, I'll make
some inquiries.

17:28.166 --> 17:30.201
OK. do that. take care.

17:30.267 --> 17:31.368
Bye.

17:31.434 --> 17:33.234
So Lucy dies last, alone.

17:33.301 --> 17:34.967
This by itself doesn't
really mean anything,

17:35.034 --> 17:37.234
But when we look again
at the Williams file,

17:37.301 --> 17:39.167
We notice that the majority
of the foreign fingerprints

17:39.234 --> 17:41.334
Came from
Karen Williams' room,

17:41.401 --> 17:44.301
Which means the unsub spent
most of his time in there
with Karen.

17:44.368 --> 17:47.234
Then he must have separated her
from the rest of the family.

17:47.301 --> 17:49.600
Lucy Downey was
already in the pool.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.600
That much was done
for the unsub.

17:51.667 --> 17:54.401
Then this unsub is driven by
some other kind of compulsion,

17:54.468 --> 17:55.468
Some other need.

17:55.533 --> 17:57.567
Hotch was right.
this isn't a coincidence.

17:57.633 --> 18:01.034
It's a possible signature.

18:02.334 --> 18:05.101
Sir, I know that,
but two families have died.

18:05.167 --> 18:08.533
No, I realize this breaks
protocol, but--

18:09.800 --> 18:13.201
No, all we want is to stop
this from happening again.

18:14.533 --> 18:17.700
Sir, I promise you,
agent Garcia
is the best we have.

18:17.767 --> 18:19.401
OK. thank you.

18:19.468 --> 18:21.267
We need to look at each
of the victims as a hub,

18:21.334 --> 18:24.334
With lives outside
of their own families.

18:24.401 --> 18:27.034
Well, each one of them
has their own connections
outside the family.

18:27.101 --> 18:28.700
School, friends, tutors,
business colleagues.

18:28.767 --> 18:30.034
And each one of these
people

18:30.101 --> 18:32.368
Are considered access points
back to the family.

18:32.434 --> 18:33.700
That could take weeks.

18:33.767 --> 18:34.900
Well, you have time.

18:34.967 --> 18:36.533
From remorse to the desire
to kill again

18:36.600 --> 18:38.767
The unsub will go through
a gamut of emotions.

18:38.834 --> 18:41.101
It could be another year
before the unsub feels
the desire to kill again.

18:41.167 --> 18:42.867
As horrific
as these crimes are,

18:42.934 --> 18:46.734
This city doesn't have
the resources to commit
that amount of time.

18:46.800 --> 18:49.468
We have full access
to all military records
for the fathers.

18:49.533 --> 18:50.700
Well, now at least

18:50.767 --> 18:54.500
We have access
to the main hub
between families.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.434
The dads.

18:55.500 --> 18:57.067
All right, well,
let's find out

18:57.134 --> 18:58.834
What connects them.

18:59.767 --> 19:01.967
Stand up.

19:04.734 --> 19:06.700
You want to see,
don't you?

19:06.767 --> 19:09.101
Very much.

19:09.167 --> 19:11.034
We're gonna show you.

19:32.934 --> 19:34.800
This is the home
of the Downey family.

19:34.867 --> 19:36.633
There were 3 children.

19:36.700 --> 19:37.967
How old are the children?

19:38.034 --> 19:40.234
12, 9, and 4.
a girl and two boys.

19:40.301 --> 19:41.700
Where were they found?

19:41.767 --> 19:43.201
Over there.

19:46.101 --> 19:47.301
Buried.

19:47.368 --> 19:48.700
Interesting.

19:48.767 --> 19:51.267
Laura, the mother,
and the two boys were killed

19:51.334 --> 19:52.734
In the house.

19:52.800 --> 19:54.667
The daughter?

20:05.533 --> 20:08.500
This is where the mother
and the youngest son
were killed.

20:08.567 --> 20:10.734
The other boy was shot
in the bedroom closet.

20:10.800 --> 20:12.900
Where's the father?

20:12.967 --> 20:14.368
overseas.

20:14.434 --> 20:16.401
The killer knows this.

20:16.468 --> 20:19.001
He knows everything
about this family,

20:19.067 --> 20:22.101
And he watches
their every move

20:22.167 --> 20:25.067
To be sure he achieves
what he needs.

20:29.368 --> 20:32.001
You have no idea
how he knows

20:32.067 --> 20:33.934
The father is gone

20:34.001 --> 20:35.767
Or how he targets
these families,

20:35.834 --> 20:37.667
And the how.

20:37.734 --> 20:40.667
That's the key.

20:40.734 --> 20:42.334
The how...

20:42.401 --> 20:44.468
Is why he...

20:44.533 --> 20:47.867
Was able to catch me.

20:47.934 --> 20:50.600
You watched the families
for days.

20:50.667 --> 20:53.934
Weeks.

20:54.001 --> 20:55.867
I got to know them.

20:55.934 --> 20:57.500
But not your guy.

20:57.567 --> 20:59.600
He doesn't need weeks.
if he did, he'd stay longer.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.234
Why?

21:04.401 --> 21:06.301
So he can enjoy them.

21:08.234 --> 21:11.700
But what I don't understand--

21:11.767 --> 21:14.234
Is why he didn't
separate the children.

21:14.301 --> 21:17.034
Exactly.

21:17.101 --> 21:20.167
That way you have
more control.
no room for error.

21:20.234 --> 21:22.734
Why he didn't put the boys
in separate rooms and say,

21:22.800 --> 21:25.001
If you cry...

21:25.067 --> 21:27.967
I'll have to kill mommy.

21:31.301 --> 21:32.967
Tell me...

21:35.667 --> 21:38.401
How did the girl die?

21:38.468 --> 21:40.368
She was drowned.

21:41.368 --> 21:44.633
Yet the others were shot.

21:56.600 --> 21:58.533
May I see her?

22:00.468 --> 22:02.967
What's so special
about the girl?

22:04.800 --> 22:07.633
To suffocate her.

22:07.700 --> 22:11.134
To feel the life
leave her body

22:11.201 --> 22:14.234
Means everything
to the man who did this.

22:14.301 --> 22:16.234
To you, maybe,
but not to this killer.

22:16.301 --> 22:17.667
Not in the same way.

22:20.134 --> 22:23.567
All I did was show them
how weak fathers could be.

22:23.633 --> 22:25.267
That's all.

22:25.334 --> 22:27.767
Every child you killed
you abused physically.

22:27.834 --> 22:31.167
For this man, there is
no sexual gratification.

22:33.001 --> 22:34.900
At least I spared
the fathers

22:34.967 --> 22:38.633
The grief of living.

22:47.368 --> 22:49.334
Please...

22:49.401 --> 22:51.633
Please don't do this.

22:52.633 --> 22:55.500
Come on. let's get you
cleaned up.

22:56.700 --> 22:59.667
Dani! didn't I tell you
to always lock the door!

22:59.734 --> 23:01.368
Nick, cleats off!

23:01.434 --> 23:04.667
Dani! where are you?

23:08.434 --> 23:10.134
Dani?

23:11.267 --> 23:12.533
Mom?

23:15.267 --> 23:16.800
Please don't--

23:16.867 --> 23:18.700
Please...

23:18.767 --> 23:21.533
Mom...

24:37.917 --> 24:40.151
The girl was suffocated,
not shot, right?

24:40.217 --> 24:42.217
yes.

24:44.318 --> 24:46.117
Just like the other two.

24:46.184 --> 24:48.284
Her name is Dani.
she's 14.

24:48.351 --> 24:49.517
and the father?

24:49.583 --> 24:51.650
Afghanistan.

24:51.717 --> 24:53.884
Does this rule out remorse?

24:53.951 --> 24:56.084
Yes, it does.

24:56.151 --> 24:59.084
So what is it now?

24:59.151 --> 25:00.018
The escalation
between kills

25:00.083 --> 25:02.217
Indicates a major
psychological break.

25:02.784 --> 25:03.918
How is it escalated?

25:03.984 --> 25:05.384
The time frame between kills

25:05.450 --> 25:06.884
Has gone from a year
to just 3 days.

25:06.951 --> 25:10.450
For the unsub, something
has dramatically changed.

25:10.517 --> 25:12.651
Some kind of major
external stressor
forced this unsub

25:12.717 --> 25:14.918
Into feeling the need
to kill again
without any remorse.

25:14.984 --> 25:16.150
Mirror neurons
and stressors

25:16.217 --> 25:17.417
Relating to
the unsub's past

25:17.484 --> 25:18.918
May have triggered this,

25:18.984 --> 25:20.317
The strongest of which
is smell.

25:23.183 --> 25:25.484
That sound.

25:26.717 --> 25:29.350
The Williams were killed
a year ago.

25:29.417 --> 25:34.018
Were there any military
manoeuvres going on
at Langley at that time?

25:34.083 --> 25:35.884
The annual air show,
but nothing as big as this.

25:35.951 --> 25:38.617
he's killed again,
hasn't he?

25:38.684 --> 25:41.651
Luckily for me.

25:41.717 --> 25:43.884
Luckily?

25:43.951 --> 25:46.551
Now we're alone.

25:48.617 --> 25:52.018
You stated that
the families don't
know the killer. why?

25:52.083 --> 25:55.018
Now we wait, right?
you and I,

25:55.117 --> 25:59.050
See if my... admirer contacts me.

25:59.117 --> 26:01.417
He will.

26:03.617 --> 26:06.050
Yours was one of the first
cases I studied.

26:06.117 --> 26:07.050
Really?

26:07.117 --> 26:08.918
Mm-hmm.

26:08.984 --> 26:13.083
I've been fascinated
ever since.

26:14.450 --> 26:16.717
With what?

26:16.784 --> 26:19.150
You.

26:26.250 --> 26:28.250
And now...

26:28.317 --> 26:32.584
You want to know
what I did...

26:32.651 --> 26:34.484
To the children.

26:34.551 --> 26:37.217
Don't you?

26:37.284 --> 26:39.284
Yes.

26:40.317 --> 26:42.217
I can show you.

26:45.384 --> 26:50.083
I can show you exactly
what I did to them.

26:50.150 --> 26:51.817
Tell me.

27:00.384 --> 27:04.217
Children are so precious.

27:04.284 --> 27:06.851
So clean.

27:08.183 --> 27:10.083
But they need guidance.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.617
Especially the girls.

27:11.684 --> 27:13.584
Why?

27:13.651 --> 27:17.717
Girls have much more
to lose...

27:17.784 --> 27:19.684
Than boys.

27:21.050 --> 27:25.918
It's a fact the female body
can handle pain much better.

27:25.984 --> 27:28.551
What did you do to them?

27:28.617 --> 27:31.183
I showed them

27:31.250 --> 27:33.250
What men...

27:33.317 --> 27:37.684
Their fathers and brothers...

27:37.751 --> 27:39.384
Are capable of.

27:40.817 --> 27:42.751
And what is that?

27:42.817 --> 27:44.918
You sure you want to know?

27:44.984 --> 27:46.484
Yes.

27:46.551 --> 27:48.551
Morgan, if the Langley
air show is the stressor,

27:48.617 --> 27:50.717
Then lark's admirer
doesn't fit the profile.

27:50.784 --> 27:52.617
A psychopath suffering
a major psychological break

27:52.684 --> 27:53.951
Doesn't brag about it, Hotch.

27:54.018 --> 27:55.684
There was nothing
you could have done

27:55.751 --> 27:57.851
That would have saved
that family today.

27:57.918 --> 27:59.517
Well, that's if I'm right
about the profile.

27:59.584 --> 28:01.350
I think you are.

28:01.417 --> 28:04.751
Karl's admirer doesn't
have anything to do
with these killings.

28:04.817 --> 28:06.317
Well, either way,
we need to know who is.

28:06.384 --> 28:08.384
Hotch, I want you to stay
with him and find out

28:08.450 --> 28:10.217
So we can stop
this son of a bitch.

28:10.284 --> 28:11.984
I plan to.

28:12.050 --> 28:14.851
Once I killed the children,

28:14.918 --> 28:17.551
It always amazed me

28:17.617 --> 28:20.050
How little...

28:20.117 --> 28:23.050
The father fought
the inevitable.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.150
Which was what?

28:25.217 --> 28:27.183
Dying.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.517
I'm trolling through
the Williams' emails,

28:29.584 --> 28:32.217
Satellite phone calls,
land line phone calls,

28:32.284 --> 28:35.884
Family photos, their life,
all of it.

28:35.951 --> 28:37.817
What about the Downeys?

28:37.884 --> 28:39.517
They're up next,
and there's a ton
to go through.

28:39.584 --> 28:41.083
Fingerprints, Garcia?
zip.

28:41.150 --> 28:42.684
They're--they--
there's nothing here.

28:42.751 --> 28:43.884
I'm sorry, folks.

28:43.951 --> 28:45.751
Garcia, widen the search.

28:45.817 --> 28:48.517
Morgan, I already did.
vicap combines
every database

28:48.584 --> 28:51.018
In this country.
we're as wide
as we can go.

28:51.083 --> 28:53.183
Abuse can have a long-term
effect on any child's brain,

28:53.250 --> 28:55.651
But for the abused child
who has the high-risk gene

28:55.717 --> 28:58.183
And the orbital cortex damage,

28:58.250 --> 28:59.684
The combination is devastating.

28:59.751 --> 29:01.517
All right, this air show
is military.

29:01.584 --> 29:04.018
These fathers are all soldiers
fighting a war on foreign soil.

29:04.083 --> 29:06.918
We know that none of these
graves are a sign of remorse.

29:06.984 --> 29:08.183
Hey, guys.
look at these graves.

29:08.250 --> 29:09.417
What are they
reminiscent of?

29:09.484 --> 29:10.517
Mass graves.

29:10.584 --> 29:11.918
Exactly.
which would indicate

29:11.984 --> 29:13.183
The unsub experienced
early pubescent

29:13.250 --> 29:14.450
3-dimensional
mirror neurons

29:14.517 --> 29:16.951
Reflecting events similar
to the one they're creating.

29:17.018 --> 29:19.250
I think this unsub
was born into conflict.

29:19.317 --> 29:20.751
But where was he born
into conflict?

29:20.817 --> 29:23.651
When was the last time
we saw anything like
mass graves in the U.s.?

29:23.717 --> 29:25.217
We haven't.
not in our lifetimes.

29:25.284 --> 29:26.551
Not within our borders.

29:26.617 --> 29:28.350
Vicap is national,
not international.

29:28.417 --> 29:30.317
Garcia, international
databases?

29:30.384 --> 29:32.417
Interpol is the biggest.
if they did it,
they're in it.

29:32.484 --> 29:34.517
It's pretty obvious
that he's done this before,

29:34.584 --> 29:36.551
But the question is where
and why.

29:36.617 --> 29:38.918
Karl, I never thought
that you'd be this honest.

29:38.984 --> 29:41.250
It takes a good woman

29:41.317 --> 29:43.284
To make an honest man.

29:43.350 --> 29:45.083
And anyway, let's face it--

29:45.150 --> 29:46.551
She's prettier than you.

29:46.617 --> 29:49.183
Karl, do you know why
you killed all those families?

29:49.250 --> 29:51.918
I've already told you why.

29:51.984 --> 29:55.284
No, you told me how,
not why.

29:55.350 --> 29:57.217
and the reasons why,
in this case,

29:57.284 --> 29:59.217
Are very different
than they were for you.

29:59.284 --> 30:01.083
they're very, very different.

30:01.150 --> 30:04.083
And as you so eloquently
have been pointing out
to agent prentiss,

30:04.150 --> 30:08.018
All of your motivations
were about sex.

30:09.284 --> 30:13.150
Motivations you learned
from your father.

30:20.651 --> 30:24.250
You really have

30:24.317 --> 30:26.617
Done your research on me,

30:26.684 --> 30:28.117
Emily.

30:28.183 --> 30:29.851
I'm flattered.

30:29.918 --> 30:32.183
You're also filled
with feelings

30:32.250 --> 30:34.651
Of extreme self-hatred.

30:34.717 --> 30:36.117
It must be distracting

30:36.183 --> 30:37.651
Working with someone
so beautiful.

30:37.717 --> 30:41.918
You forced those men
to watch their children die,

30:41.984 --> 30:44.083
And here's why, Karl.

30:44.150 --> 30:46.717
Here's why
you are what you are.

30:46.784 --> 30:48.284
What I would
do to you.

30:48.350 --> 30:50.517
By killing
the fathers last,

30:50.584 --> 30:52.884
You were killing
your own father,

30:52.951 --> 30:54.884
And ultimately yourself,

30:54.951 --> 30:58.484
Over and over again.

31:11.617 --> 31:13.751
This isn't over,
agent Hotchner.

31:13.817 --> 31:17.250
At least not for you.

31:19.018 --> 31:20.584
Wait, Hotch.

31:22.417 --> 31:25.517
For Karl, it's all about
the fathers.

31:25.584 --> 31:28.450
In this case,
it's all about the girls.

31:28.517 --> 31:30.183
They die last.

31:30.250 --> 31:33.517
They're laid out last.
none of them are shot.

31:33.584 --> 31:36.317
None of them show any signs
of sexual motive.

31:36.384 --> 31:40.551
What if we applied that logic
to these killings?

31:40.617 --> 31:41.751
That's something
we hadn't considered.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.684
Why would we?
it's so rare.

31:43.751 --> 31:44.684
What is?

31:44.751 --> 31:45.817
The killer's a woman.

31:45.884 --> 31:48.250
A woman?
I'll let Morgan know.

31:50.150 --> 31:51.984
Karl, just now you said

31:52.050 --> 31:54.551
That this wasn't over
for me.

31:54.617 --> 31:56.717
What did you mean by that?

31:59.050 --> 32:00.617
He's just getting
warmed up.

32:00.684 --> 32:02.984
It's just...

32:03.751 --> 32:07.817
You don't see it.

32:07.884 --> 32:09.417
But you will.

32:09.484 --> 32:12.918
All right, we'll
work it in right now.

32:12.984 --> 32:14.851
Prentiss thinks the unsub
might be a woman.

32:14.918 --> 32:16.817
That's why we couldn't find
a sexual motive.

32:16.884 --> 32:19.784
Wherever she's from,
her father's
a military man.

32:19.851 --> 32:21.551
Derek, I've got a hit.
Interpol.

32:21.617 --> 32:24.018
2 hits. 3 hits.
3 crime scenes.
3 different cities.

32:24.083 --> 32:26.317
The first--Zagreb, 1998.

32:26.384 --> 32:28.350
A woman and her 8-month-old
baby are both killed.

32:28.417 --> 32:30.350
And then 2 years later,

32:30.417 --> 32:32.918
The same prints show up
in modena, Italy,

32:32.984 --> 32:35.484
Then 2007, London, England,
young couple, both shot.

32:35.551 --> 32:38.217
You were right.
she's killed before.

32:38.284 --> 32:40.183
Zagreb is the capital
city of Croatia.

32:40.250 --> 32:41.183
Is that significant?

32:41.250 --> 32:42.784
Between 1991 and '95
they fought

32:42.851 --> 32:44.617
A bitter battle
for independence.

32:44.684 --> 32:45.951
Serbian forces
tried to ethnically cleanse

32:46.018 --> 32:48.450
Over 40,000 Bosnian
Muslims.

32:48.517 --> 32:51.018
Then at some point
within the last 2 years,
she moved to America.

32:51.083 --> 32:52.951
She's on the run.
and ran right into a city

32:53.018 --> 32:54.384
Filled with
military families.

32:54.450 --> 32:56.751
The only mass graves
reminiscent of the ones
the unsubs created

32:56.817 --> 32:58.851
Were found all over Bosnia
after the war,

32:58.918 --> 33:01.183
But none of them rival
that of srebrenica.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.951
Dutch U.n. forces
created a safe haven
for refugees.

33:04.018 --> 33:06.384
then in 1995,
Bosnian Serb forces
surrounded the town.

33:06.450 --> 33:09.050
a psychopath
born in the middle
of that conflict--

33:09.117 --> 33:10.684
That's not a good mix.

33:10.751 --> 33:12.918
she's exacting
her life experiences
onto the victims.

33:12.984 --> 33:14.684
You think this woman
was there?

33:14.751 --> 33:16.584
Well, think about it.
Langley filling up
with civilians

33:16.651 --> 33:18.584
And military vehicles
just like srebrenica.

33:18.651 --> 33:19.651
Can you determine
her age?

33:19.717 --> 33:21.284
Based on victimology,

33:21.350 --> 33:23.484
Each of these girls
is no older than 15.

33:23.551 --> 33:25.584
The Balkan war lasted
between '93 and '95,

33:25.651 --> 33:27.018
So if the girls
represent the unsub,

33:27.083 --> 33:28.817
She's somewhere
in her late 20s.

33:28.884 --> 33:30.450
how did srebrenica end?

33:30.517 --> 33:31.984
it was a massacre.

34:04.250 --> 34:06.551
I don't think this woman
has anything to do with Karl.

34:06.917 --> 34:07.917
I encouraged him.

34:09.083 --> 34:10.150
Ohh.

34:10.217 --> 34:12.217
I flirted with him.

34:13.684 --> 34:16.016
Made it personal.

34:16.083 --> 34:19.850
Getting intimate
with a killer is...

34:19.917 --> 34:21.250
So different.

34:21.317 --> 34:23.516
It's what we do.

34:25.516 --> 34:28.818
Yeah. but...

34:28.882 --> 34:31.684
There's no fixing
how I feel right now,
is there?

34:31.751 --> 34:33.217
No.

34:33.284 --> 34:35.250
But it helped the case.

34:35.317 --> 34:38.850
And you did
what you had to.

34:38.917 --> 34:40.351
Agent Hotchner.

34:40.417 --> 34:41.650
Before you go,

34:41.717 --> 34:44.784
There's one final thing
I'd like to share with you.

34:44.850 --> 34:48.150
let's just
get this over with.

34:48.217 --> 34:50.484
This unsub is armed
and suffering

34:50.551 --> 34:52.351
A major
psychological break,

34:52.417 --> 34:54.083
And she will not
hesitate to kill again.

34:54.150 --> 34:56.217
She's white
and in her 20s.

34:56.284 --> 34:58.284
We believe she came to
the U.s. a few years ago.

34:58.351 --> 34:59.684
She's likely on foot.

34:59.751 --> 35:00.850
She could be
eastern European.

35:00.917 --> 35:02.751
She may speak
little to no English.

35:02.818 --> 35:04.484
Now, if you manage
to apprehend or corner her,

35:04.551 --> 35:05.684
Do not underestimate
this woman.

35:05.751 --> 35:07.351
She will try
to fight her way out.

35:07.417 --> 35:10.317
The Downeys live less than
a mile from the Foresters,

35:10.384 --> 35:11.651
Which means she's
somewhere in this area.

35:11.718 --> 35:14.751
I see something.

35:14.818 --> 35:16.217
Wait.

35:17.818 --> 35:20.784
Wait a minute.
could it be?

35:22.017 --> 35:24.417
They're all connected
to the same site.

35:24.484 --> 35:26.351
Every media outlet
is being informed

35:26.417 --> 35:28.050
Of the clear
and present danger
to the public.

35:28.117 --> 35:30.084
Thank you very much.

35:30.150 --> 35:32.250
OK, guys,
I really have got something.

35:32.317 --> 35:33.751
All of these photos,
every one of them,

35:33.818 --> 35:36.883
Was uploaded
to a user website
called photo bug.

35:36.950 --> 35:38.050
Photo bug?

35:38.117 --> 35:40.250
Yeah. members can upload
photos, videos, email,

35:40.317 --> 35:42.384
Web cam, chats.
I use it all the time.

35:42.451 --> 35:45.818
Every one of these families
extensively used this site

35:45.883 --> 35:47.017
For months, even years.

35:47.084 --> 35:49.184
All these family photos
were printed by photo bug.

35:49.250 --> 35:50.551
Isn't it protected?

35:50.617 --> 35:52.384
Not from the people
who run it.

35:52.451 --> 35:54.250
It's a great way
for military families
to keep in touch.

35:54.317 --> 35:55.417
And a perfect way
to target a family

35:55.484 --> 35:56.584
Without anybody's
knowledge.

35:56.651 --> 35:57.651
They outsource work
to people

35:57.718 --> 35:58.718
All over the country.

35:58.784 --> 35:59.818
So I took your profile,

35:59.883 --> 36:01.184
Hacked into their
employee database,

36:01.250 --> 36:03.017
Came up with this list
of potentials,

36:03.084 --> 36:06.017
One of which is a match
that screams homicidal bitch.

36:06.084 --> 36:08.284
Her name's Miranda Dracar,
she was an orphan,

36:08.351 --> 36:10.751
Born in Sarajevo
during 1982.

36:10.818 --> 36:12.950
She was adopted by a family
in srebrenica.

36:13.017 --> 36:14.317
let's go.

36:21.917 --> 36:23.017
Clear.

36:23.084 --> 36:24.584
Clear.

36:24.651 --> 36:26.484
The foresters.

36:29.250 --> 36:30.150
Morgan.

36:30.217 --> 36:32.084
The unsub's next victim.

36:32.150 --> 36:33.417
He's a marine.

36:35.684 --> 36:38.883
Usmc, first battalion,
engineer.

36:38.950 --> 36:41.284
Jennifer,
call your contact.

36:42.850 --> 36:45.818
sir, I'm gonna need access
to every piece of data

36:45.883 --> 36:47.451
On U.s. marine sergeant young.
it may save his family.

36:47.517 --> 36:50.584
why are you
always so slow?
we're late. come on.

36:50.651 --> 36:53.184
I am, I am.

37:06.551 --> 37:09.584
So you think you found
my admirer.

37:09.651 --> 37:11.451
A woman.

37:11.517 --> 37:13.017
No. we found the killer.

37:13.084 --> 37:14.818
With my help, of course.

37:14.883 --> 37:20.351
Your admirer is
exactly like everyone
who contacts you--lost.

37:20.417 --> 37:24.384
My love, your guy
is far from lost.

37:24.451 --> 37:25.517
We're done.

37:25.584 --> 37:26.917
So is he.

37:28.351 --> 37:31.684
"look at what
I have done."

37:32.684 --> 37:33.950
It's quite brilliant,
you know?

37:34.017 --> 37:36.017
We will find
whoever sent you that.

37:36.084 --> 37:39.617
No, agent Hotchner,
I rather think

37:39.684 --> 37:42.317
He's already found you.

38:03.883 --> 38:04.850
Uhh! uhh!

38:04.917 --> 38:06.917
Uhh!
uhh!

38:17.317 --> 38:19.584
Ohh!

38:33.983 --> 38:35.284
Morgan?

38:35.351 --> 38:37.150
I'm all right.

38:37.217 --> 38:39.150
I'm all right.

38:46.850 --> 38:49.751
Hotch.

38:49.818 --> 38:51.684
Hotch.

38:51.751 --> 38:54.551
I can't believe
you can't see
what he's doing.

38:54.617 --> 38:56.983
What is going on?

38:57.050 --> 38:58.917
He's torturing him.

38:58.983 --> 39:00.017
Who?

39:00.084 --> 39:02.751
It's great to see you
squirm, agent Hotchner.

39:14.317 --> 39:16.017
Foyet.

39:20.718 --> 39:22.551
He knew you'd come.

39:22.617 --> 39:26.451
Ha ha ha ha ha!
