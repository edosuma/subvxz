WEBVTT

00:01.200 --> 00:04.560
'Previously on St Elsewhere...'
Your hand isn't healed.

00:04.560 --> 00:08.560
Would I rush into surgery
if I couldn't handle it?

00:09.240 --> 00:12.680
I'm having trouble. I can't do it.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.000
You can't continue operating.

00:14.000 --> 00:18.000
I'm no lecturer!
I'm more vital than that!

00:19.240 --> 00:20.800
Are you OK?

00:20.800 --> 00:24.800
First a girl died in my arms.
Now Robert wants a divorce.

02:00.160 --> 02:02.960
There's a new patient on
the fourth floor, Sparky.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.960
I don't think he'll die because
the people in the room are laughing.

02:09.360 --> 02:11.680
What will we call him?

02:11.680 --> 02:14.640
How about Crewcut?

02:14.640 --> 02:16.240
I hate it when they die.

02:16.240 --> 02:18.600
All those sad faces.

02:18.600 --> 02:22.600
The windows will be opening soon.

02:22.680 --> 02:26.640
Patients love fresh air.

02:26.640 --> 02:29.600
You know, morning's the best time.

02:29.600 --> 02:33.600
None of that awful afternoon glare.

02:35.640 --> 02:37.880
There's Miss Yellow Nightgown.
Remember her?

02:37.880 --> 02:40.840
She has even more flowers.

02:40.840 --> 02:44.840
People just keep sending them,
but nobody comes to see her.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.960
Schoolteacher maybe...
they're from the kids,

02:49.960 --> 02:53.960
or maybe she's a person
that everyone respects, but

02:54.680 --> 02:57.720
nobody really likes enough to visit.

02:57.720 --> 03:01.160
Freckles, the girl with the leg cast.

03:01.160 --> 03:05.160
She's leaving.
Isn't that nice?

03:05.480 --> 03:08.200
Ooh, a man's rear end is showing.

03:08.200 --> 03:11.320
One size usually fits all,
Mr Bethune.

03:11.320 --> 03:15.080
The doctor will be here shortly.

03:15.080 --> 03:19.080
Fiscus, have you seen Ehrlich?
Not since the stall this morning.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.720
Tell Napa Valley Slim I need him.

03:22.720 --> 03:25.120
Sounds bad.  It's worse.

03:25.120 --> 03:28.480
You'll be using Dr Craig's office.

03:28.480 --> 03:31.480
I'll show you the way.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.840
We're very glad you could take
over for Dr Craig.

03:34.840 --> 03:38.280
You're spoken highly of
at George Washington.

03:38.280 --> 03:42.280
I wish their salary reflected
their appreciation.

03:42.880 --> 03:46.880
I spoke to the board about your pay.
It won't reflect ours either.

03:49.800 --> 03:52.200
Call Bernheimer Memorial
if I'm needed.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.800
I can't find my beeper.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.680
Tomorrow's my last day.

03:55.680 --> 03:59.320
Surgery will undergo
a smooth changeover.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.640
Ike to JFK... No folderol.

04:01.640 --> 04:04.880
Sure you want to give up
all your duties?

04:04.880 --> 04:07.360
I need action.

04:07.360 --> 04:10.800
Besides, the sooner I get home,
the sooner I'll be back.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.520
I'm going to the nephro
conference at Bernheimer.

04:13.520 --> 04:17.519
Oh, free buffet?

04:17.519 --> 04:19.680
Where does Daniel go?

04:19.680 --> 04:21.959
When's my replacement arriving?

04:21.959 --> 04:25.440
Boning up so I can return to active
medicine.

04:25.440 --> 04:29.440
Face facts, Donald. There's nothing
active about nephrology.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.720
Speaking of kidneys,
I need to drain mine.

04:33.960 --> 04:36.240
Mrs Deangelis, how are you?

04:36.240 --> 04:37.600
Not so good.

04:37.600 --> 04:39.160
It'll be fine.

04:39.160 --> 04:43.160
Why a biopsy?
The cancer's back, isn't it?

04:43.160 --> 04:45.360
Just a precaution. Really.

04:45.360 --> 04:48.240
Hearing that word again...

04:48.240 --> 04:49.840
cancer.

04:49.840 --> 04:51.760
No-one's saying you have cancer.

04:51.760 --> 04:54.040
You could have an infection.

04:54.040 --> 04:55.840
The effects of the radiation.

04:55.840 --> 04:58.480
After the treatment, I thanked God.

04:58.480 --> 05:02.480
They said it would probably work, and
I wouldn't have to lose my breast.

05:04.280 --> 05:05.840
I don't want to lose my breast.

05:05.840 --> 05:09.840
I'll do everything I can to make
sure you don't.

05:10.200 --> 05:13.120
We'll beat this problem.  OK?

05:13.120 --> 05:15.160
You think so?

05:15.160 --> 05:19.160
Leave the worrying to me.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.440
That one.

05:21.440 --> 05:24.560
You got it.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.520
Would you mind hurrying up?

05:26.520 --> 05:30.000
Last ice-cream truck in
this neighbourhood got popped.

05:30.000 --> 05:33.680
Memories... Hot summers, no school,
rummaging through Mom's purse.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.240
Where's the Good Humour Man?

05:36.240 --> 05:38.760
Auschlander?  I said humour,
not tumour.

05:38.760 --> 05:41.600
Right there.

05:41.600 --> 05:42.280
How did he become younger than us?

05:42.280 --> 05:43.960
How did he become younger than us?

05:43.960 --> 05:46.200
Heading home?

05:46.200 --> 05:48.600
I've got to see someone first.

05:48.600 --> 05:51.880
Old guy, Joe Ewell...
lives with his golden retriever Thor.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.720
Thor?

05:53.720 --> 05:56.520
Naw, just a little stiff.

05:56.520 --> 05:58.880
Isn't this guy in
your community service programme?

05:58.880 --> 06:02.800
Yeah, we talk about everything.

06:02.800 --> 06:05.560
House calls to Gray Panthers?
Haven't you heard?

06:05.560 --> 06:08.960
The trustees forced
Westphall to drop outreach.

06:08.960 --> 06:11.280
You despised it originally.

06:11.280 --> 06:15.280
I changed my mind.
Oh, what got Lucy so mad?

06:15.280 --> 06:19.280
She probably realised who lost
McGyver's chart.
Thanks for the warning.

06:22.000 --> 06:24.160
Whoa! Line forms to the rear, sonny.

06:24.160 --> 06:28.160
Mr Whiskers on five just lies
there and doesn't eat.

06:29.680 --> 06:33.680
Nobody takes him to
the bathroom any more.

06:34.040 --> 06:38.040
Oh, did I remember
to change your paper?

06:38.680 --> 06:40.520
Yes, I did.

06:40.520 --> 06:44.520
There's a picture of young
Joe Kennedy campaigning.

06:44.840 --> 06:48.640
You know, Sparky, when we moved here,
Bobby Kennedy was always on

06:48.640 --> 06:52.400
the bottom of your cage,
running for President.

06:52.400 --> 06:55.560
We've seen a lot of
patients since then,

06:55.560 --> 06:59.560
like the birdman that
jumped off the roof.

06:59.880 --> 07:02.840
I'll be in St Eligius one day.

07:02.840 --> 07:05.440
I'll ask for the fourth floor because

07:05.440 --> 07:09.440
the light's good and
the windows are bigger.

07:10.200 --> 07:14.200
I'll be safe there
in the doctor's hands,

07:14.880 --> 07:17.400
like Miss Yellow Nightgown,

07:17.400 --> 07:21.400
not living alone in an old
building with dark halls.

07:22.000 --> 07:24.880
Remember when the elevator broke?

07:24.880 --> 07:28.880
It took me all
afternoon to get upstairs.

07:29.360 --> 07:33.360
They'll take care of me
when my time comes.

07:34.040 --> 07:38.040
Oh, there's Dr Kindly Grandfather.

07:38.360 --> 07:41.840
He's listening to music.

07:41.840 --> 07:43.560
Hah!

07:43.560 --> 07:47.560
There's a woman cleaning Dr Little
Big Man's windows.

07:48.720 --> 07:52.720
Who's she?

07:55.000 --> 07:58.480
It's about time you cleaners came.

07:58.480 --> 08:02.480
Who are you?
Who do you think?

08:02.840 --> 08:05.400
Dr Craig?

08:05.400 --> 08:09.400
I thought you'd already gone.
Dr Kiem?  Paulette.

08:10.000 --> 08:14.000
Nobody told me when you were coming!

08:14.240 --> 08:16.320
Well, uh, welcome.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.520
Thank you.

08:18.520 --> 08:22.520
It's a pleasure to meet you.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.480
Let me give you your desk back.

08:26.480 --> 08:28.120
No, no, no. Make yourself at home.

08:28.120 --> 08:31.240
Tomorrow, this office will be yours.

08:31.240 --> 08:33.640
Temporarily, that is.

08:33.640 --> 08:37.640
Let's pretend your
name's already on the door.

08:37.760 --> 08:40.520
Let me move those.  No problem.

08:40.520 --> 08:44.520
I came straight from the airport.

08:44.920 --> 08:46.720
I've heard great things about you.

08:46.720 --> 08:48.600
I'm honoured.

08:48.600 --> 08:52.120
It won't be easy replacing
a Cushing Award winner...

08:52.120 --> 08:53.480
temporarily, that is.

08:53.480 --> 08:57.360
You'll do fine. The main thing is
to...

08:57.360 --> 08:59.760
be comfortable.

08:59.760 --> 09:01.560
I'll do anything I can.

09:01.560 --> 09:03.040
BUZZER

09:03.040 --> 09:05.320
I'll get it.

09:05.320 --> 09:08.320
Hello.

09:08.320 --> 09:11.080
It's for you.

09:11.080 --> 09:15.080
Kiem here.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.720
30-year-old man, febrile,
tachycardia, diarrhoea.
Ate raw oysters.

09:24.400 --> 09:28.400
Lytes, CBC, BUM, creatinine, IV,
d-five, half, with 40 of K.

09:30.160 --> 09:32.920
Dr Wade, remember
we spoke about my boat?

09:32.920 --> 09:35.080
Mr Ville?

09:35.080 --> 09:37.800
Severe sunburn a week ago.

09:37.800 --> 09:39.520
I had this great idea.

09:39.520 --> 09:41.200
Circumnavigate the globe...solo.

09:41.200 --> 09:44.960
Was almost to Provincetown
when Hurricane Upchuck hit.

09:44.960 --> 09:47.040
Jackie, seen a stray chart around?

09:47.040 --> 09:49.480
You lost another one?  Misplaced.

09:49.480 --> 09:53.480
This was my first stop.  Sorry.

09:53.520 --> 09:56.240
Been all screwed up lately
what with Craig leaving.

09:56.240 --> 10:00.240
I feel abandoned, left in the lurch.

10:00.760 --> 10:02.360
Alone?

10:02.360 --> 10:06.360
Sorry. I forgot you were
chugging towards divorce junction.

10:07.520 --> 10:09.560
Didn't mean to rub
salsa in the wound.

10:09.560 --> 10:11.640
It's all right.

10:11.640 --> 10:14.080
That's not what you said earlier.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.360
I've had time to think.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.600
Resigned, eh?

10:17.600 --> 10:19.880
No. I'll get Robert back.

10:19.880 --> 10:22.920
(VOMITS)

10:22.920 --> 10:26.920
I should wear rubber clothes.

10:33.680 --> 10:36.240
Mr Ewell?

10:36.240 --> 10:37.760
Mr Ewell?

10:37.760 --> 10:39.320
Dr Fiscus.

10:39.320 --> 10:42.280
(DOG BARKS)

10:42.280 --> 10:46.280
Mr Ewell?

11:17.920 --> 11:21.920
Robert's just going through a phase.
He need some time to himself.

11:22.240 --> 11:23.720
He tell you this?

11:23.720 --> 11:25.680
We've been together
since high school.

11:25.680 --> 11:27.880
I know he's calling
before the phone rings.

11:27.880 --> 11:30.240
Anybody met Craig's replacement?

11:30.240 --> 11:32.120
Lucy's looking for you.

11:32.120 --> 11:34.280
One chart...big deal.

11:34.280 --> 11:36.840
The new chief of surgery is a woman.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.040
I hope she likes bootlicking.

11:39.040 --> 11:42.200
Ehrlich, shut up.
He's the brown nose I mentioned.

11:42.200 --> 11:46.160
Dr Craig. Oh, I...

11:46.160 --> 11:47.960
This is Dr Kiem.

11:47.960 --> 11:50.600
She will be chief of
surgery while I'm gone.

11:50.600 --> 11:54.600
Your respect for her starts now.
Dr Kiem, rounds are yours.

11:56.080 --> 11:59.800
We'll start with you, Dr Wade.

11:59.800 --> 12:01.880
What's your first name?

12:01.880 --> 12:03.080
Jacqueline.

12:03.080 --> 12:04.440
Jackie?

12:04.440 --> 12:05.200
Sure.

12:05.200 --> 12:06.240
Sure.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.240
The patient is a male, 47,
with pancreatitis.

12:10.880 --> 12:14.160
His amalase is high at 672.

12:14.160 --> 12:18.160
His hematocrit's fallen from 42
on admission to 31 this morning.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.440
Any significant...

12:19.440 --> 12:20.600
You skimped, Wade.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.880
Was the patient febrile?

12:22.880 --> 12:23.520
Yes, sir. 102.

12:23.520 --> 12:24.440
Yes, sir. 102.

12:24.440 --> 12:26.920
You got a CT-scan?

12:26.920 --> 12:28.120
Not yet.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.120
You must confirm
hemorrhagic pancreatitis.

12:32.600 --> 12:34.720
You agree, Dr Kiem?

12:34.720 --> 12:36.480
I was leading to that.

12:36.480 --> 12:38.280
All yours. Continue.

12:38.280 --> 12:42.040
One more thing... If our diagnosis
is correct, and it is,

12:42.040 --> 12:46.040
then a Grey-Turner's
sign should appear by tomorrow.

12:51.600 --> 12:54.520
You stupid, Birch?

12:54.520 --> 12:57.440
Who are you?
Ronald Bedder from pathology.

12:57.440 --> 13:01.160
You sent a biopsy specimen for Mrs
Deangelis?  Cancer, right?

13:01.160 --> 13:04.080
Did you get a chest x-ray?

13:04.080 --> 13:07.560
Why?  To protect my
chromosomes from getting zapped.

13:07.560 --> 13:09.600
What are you talking about?

13:09.600 --> 13:11.480
Your patient doesn't have cancer...

13:11.480 --> 13:15.480
she's radioactive.

13:17.080 --> 13:21.080
Dad, don't you want a drink?

13:22.000 --> 13:26.000
 Oh, my God.  He still can't speak,
but he seems to understand.

13:27.320 --> 13:31.320
The highway was bumper to bumper.
That's all right.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.000
Is it another stroke?

13:34.000 --> 13:36.680
The doctors aren't sure, naturally.

13:36.680 --> 13:40.680
Poor Daddy. Last time, seeing him all
crumpled like that, I just froze.

13:44.920 --> 13:46.880
I don't even know...
is this a good hospital?

13:46.880 --> 13:49.320
Supposed to be the worst.

13:49.320 --> 13:53.160
Oh, Dr Fiscus,
this is my sister Katie.

13:53.160 --> 13:56.880
They're putting a catheter in, Joe,
so we'll give you some privacy.

13:56.880 --> 14:00.880
OK, we'll be back, Dad.

14:06.440 --> 14:09.240
You're the trombone player?  No.

14:09.240 --> 14:11.240
I mean, not since grade school.

14:11.240 --> 14:15.240
You gave him the Sony
for his birthday.  Yes.

14:16.920 --> 14:19.000
He likes talking about his
daughters.

14:19.000 --> 14:21.040
Did he have another stroke?
Yes.

14:21.040 --> 14:23.840
He always bounces back.

14:23.840 --> 14:27.200
This time there's
brain-tissue damage, paralysis...

14:27.200 --> 14:28.880
How long will he stay this way?

14:28.880 --> 14:32.880
Can't tell.
He'll probably get worse.

14:33.120 --> 14:35.800
Can't you use a wonder drug?

14:35.800 --> 14:39.520
Your father's not sick in a
way we can cure.

14:39.520 --> 14:41.560
His body's giving out.

14:41.560 --> 14:44.480
He'll need chronic
supportive care somewhere else.

14:44.480 --> 14:46.360
Who'll care of him?

14:46.360 --> 14:49.240
OK, rounds are over.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.360
Ehrlich,
you were unusually moronic today.

14:52.360 --> 14:54.520
Thank you, everyone.

14:54.520 --> 14:57.400
Getting chummy with the residents...
that's not wise.

14:57.400 --> 14:58.760
I like familiarity.

14:58.760 --> 15:02.760
Well, it's as my mentor
Dr David Domedion said,

15:03.960 --> 15:07.600
"Residents and rugs are there to be
stepped on and beaten

15:07.600 --> 15:11.600
"every once in a while." Here we go.

15:13.360 --> 15:16.200
Miss Kimbrough,
this is the new doctor I mentioned.

15:16.200 --> 15:20.200
Hello, Margaret. I'm Paulette Kiem.

15:22.640 --> 15:25.120
You've had an aortic aneurysm
for a while,

15:25.120 --> 15:27.680
and you've been
feeling some discomfort.

15:27.680 --> 15:30.120
Just like the chart says.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.000
The pain comes from your
gallbladder.

15:33.000 --> 15:37.000
We have to take it out.

15:39.120 --> 15:41.200
The aneurysm is getting bigger.

15:41.200 --> 15:45.120
We should fix that, too.

15:45.120 --> 15:47.960
If Dr Craig agrees.  I agree.

15:47.960 --> 15:50.760
Let's tackle both problems at once.

15:50.760 --> 15:53.080
One OR trip should be enough.

15:53.080 --> 15:54.600
(CLEARS HIS THROAT)

15:54.600 --> 15:58.280
That certainly is a way to go,
but let's split the operations.

15:58.280 --> 16:02.280
Do the aneurysm now
and the gallbladder in three months.

16:03.000 --> 16:05.360
Miss Kimbrough...

16:05.360 --> 16:06.640
you'll be in good hands.

16:06.640 --> 16:10.640
Oh. Dr Little Big Man
put his hand on her,

16:12.240 --> 16:14.360
comforted her.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.120
Oh.

16:16.120 --> 16:20.120
Every time he does that,
all his patients relax.

16:22.440 --> 16:26.440
It's something related to Miss
Yellow Nightgown's heart, I guess,

16:28.120 --> 16:30.960
because they stuck
those wires on her chest,

16:30.960 --> 16:34.720
and she feels there like it hurts.

16:34.720 --> 16:37.200
It could be my heart, too.

16:37.200 --> 16:40.560
Heart trouble runs in my family.

16:40.560 --> 16:44.080
And the doctor could take care of me.

16:44.080 --> 16:46.200
And touch me.

16:46.200 --> 16:50.200
And I'd relax.

16:50.920 --> 16:54.280
Just like Papa's touch.

16:54.280 --> 16:56.040
And Frank's when he was alive.

16:56.040 --> 16:59.920
And the twins.

16:59.920 --> 17:03.920
Reassuring.

17:04.119 --> 17:06.800
0.3 millicuries, plus or minus.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.200
Who's Millie Curry?
And who are you?

17:09.200 --> 17:11.359
Herb Benzyck.

17:11.359 --> 17:13.359
Nuclear medicine.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.520
She's not dangerous from a
distance if you don't stay too long.

17:16.520 --> 17:19.359
See how the radioactivity diminishes.

17:19.359 --> 17:22.839
Am I going to die?

17:22.839 --> 17:24.920
After your breast cancer was treated,

17:24.920 --> 17:28.280
doctors didn't remove
all the implant seeds.

17:28.280 --> 17:29.880
Some were accidentally left behind.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.880
Pretty rare, but possible.

17:31.880 --> 17:35.880
But will I die?  The seeds' radiation
causes your problem.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.640
Those Russians who were exposed...

17:40.640 --> 17:42.520
they expect more to die every year.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.520
That dose was much higher.

17:46.680 --> 17:50.680
There's no sign of cancer.
You said that, but I'm contaminated.

17:51.480 --> 17:55.480
No. When we remove the seeds,
you'll be non-radioactive.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.200
Did I say not to worry?

17:58.200 --> 18:01.360
Yes, but last time I believed you.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.640
Be grateful, Mrs Deangelis.

18:04.640 --> 18:06.400
You don't have the big "C."

18:06.400 --> 18:10.400
And if there's a blackout, we'll
use you as a cheap source of power.

18:21.080 --> 18:22.960
Ah, Ehrlich.

18:22.960 --> 18:25.200
Shall we?

18:25.200 --> 18:29.200
I should've said something.  Today's
my grandmother's 90th birthday.

18:29.280 --> 18:32.200
You'll beat me
up for a missing chart?

18:32.200 --> 18:35.280
You're taking me
to her party tonight.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.680
You're asking me out?

18:37.680 --> 18:41.440
In traditional Greek families,

18:41.440 --> 18:44.560
a woman without a man is
like a dog without a bone.

18:44.560 --> 18:47.400
I still don't understand.  Why me?

18:47.400 --> 18:51.280
Because you were stupid
enough to lose McGyver's chart.

18:51.280 --> 18:54.040
There's no record of McGyver's meds,

18:54.040 --> 18:58.040
and we'll pay when McGyver's
sphincter does a rumba
in Dr Westphall's hand.

19:00.240 --> 19:02.120
What time?

19:02.120 --> 19:04.400
Seven...

19:04.400 --> 19:08.400
and don't dress stupid.

19:11.800 --> 19:14.320
You sure?  Yes, we've decided.

19:14.320 --> 19:17.040
If that's what you want,
I'll handle the paperwork.

19:17.040 --> 19:21.040
Oh, good. Thank you.

19:22.960 --> 19:26.960
Would you push basement, please?

19:27.800 --> 19:31.000
You want to end up in a nursing
home?  Just the records room.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.720
If you were dying.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.040
I am.

19:36.040 --> 19:38.080
And couldn't care of yourself.

19:38.080 --> 19:41.960
Oh. Many fine institutions

19:41.960 --> 19:45.960
have managed to turn a sterile
environment into a comfortable abode.

19:52.600 --> 19:56.600
Unfortunately, these people can't
afford the best. It's a nightmare.

19:57.120 --> 19:59.560
This is more than hypothetical.

19:59.560 --> 20:03.560
It's a patient of mine.
His daughters are putting him away.

20:05.200 --> 20:09.200
What will happen to his dog?  Like
Jimmy Carter at Camp David Accords,

20:10.800 --> 20:13.680
"You must pursue other
options with these people."

20:13.680 --> 20:14.920
They won't listen.

20:14.920 --> 20:17.840
Then find the best possible place.

20:17.840 --> 20:21.320
It's a terrible way to end life...

20:21.320 --> 20:25.320
a victim of your family's mercy.

20:40.240 --> 20:43.040
There you are.
Come on in.

20:43.040 --> 20:45.640
I'm not in scrubs.

20:45.640 --> 20:48.400
I'm looking over your surgical
suite.

20:48.400 --> 20:52.320
14 ORs operating around
the clock seven days a week.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.520
A model of efficiency.

20:54.520 --> 20:58.520
Take a gander at that
operating microscope.

21:00.680 --> 21:04.680
Took me five years of
badgering to get that.

21:05.840 --> 21:09.280
Should come in handy for your
microvascular work.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.360
I remember the old OR,

21:11.360 --> 21:15.360
before all these conveniences.
Ether masks were in vogue.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.600
Well...

21:19.600 --> 21:22.520
look around all you want.

21:22.520 --> 21:26.520
By the way, I changed Miss
Kimbrough's medication.

21:32.960 --> 21:36.760
Dr Craig. Miss Kimbrough's
my patient now.  So?

21:36.760 --> 21:40.760
You should've asked me.
For crying out loud.

21:41.160 --> 21:45.080
You cut me off, damaging my
credibility in front of patients.

21:45.080 --> 21:49.080
When trying two operations at once,
you risk infection.

21:49.440 --> 21:52.440
Only with acute colicystitis.

21:52.440 --> 21:55.800
Miss Kimbrough has no fever,
no sign of acute condition.

21:55.800 --> 21:59.800
By operating once, we reduce her
exposure to anesthesia.

22:00.520 --> 22:03.320
Are you telling me about
surgical procedure?  No.

22:03.320 --> 22:06.480
I'm telling you to back off.
Let me do my job.

22:06.480 --> 22:08.480
This is my department, lady!

22:08.480 --> 22:12.480
Fine. When you're ready to give it
up, have Dr Auschlander call me.

22:17.840 --> 22:21.840
When Saigon fell, it should've
dropped on her.

22:27.760 --> 22:31.760
MUSIC AND CHATTER

22:44.680 --> 22:48.680
PLATE SMASHES

23:10.760 --> 23:14.760
Here's your lover. We have great fun.

23:16.360 --> 23:18.840
I get more retsina. Yasou!

23:18.840 --> 23:21.000
Yasou!

23:21.000 --> 23:23.800
Got to hide the china
when Uncle Nikos stops by.

23:23.800 --> 23:27.000
Enjoying your birthday? Yow.

23:27.000 --> 23:31.000
Mama likes you.

23:31.880 --> 23:34.120
Everybody like this Victor of yours.

23:34.120 --> 23:38.120
Isn't he something?
He'd make good Greek.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.880
I loved Kojak.
Who loves you, baby?

23:41.880 --> 23:43.920
Where you hide this guy?

23:43.920 --> 23:47.480
We Papandraos come from Sifnos.

23:47.480 --> 23:51.040
Only we were beginning
to think Lucy came from Lesbos.

23:51.040 --> 23:53.480
(LAUGH)

23:53.480 --> 23:57.440
(SPEAKS GREEK)

23:57.440 --> 23:59.400
What did he say?

23:59.400 --> 24:02.560
Roughly translated, it means,
"Here's to your children."

24:02.560 --> 24:06.560
Yasou!

24:09.920 --> 24:13.840
Paulette.
Sorry I wasn't here this morning.

24:13.840 --> 24:17.840
How do I get out of here?
This way.

24:19.600 --> 24:23.360
We've thought about putting up
"you are here" maps.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.920
I need one for my life.

24:25.920 --> 24:29.800
I felt that way before
I attended a clinic today.

24:29.800 --> 24:32.640
It revved me up to do more active
work with patients.

24:32.640 --> 24:34.600
Mark Craig knows where he is.

24:34.600 --> 24:37.680
He thinks he knows where
everybody else should be.

24:37.680 --> 24:38.840
Like me.

24:38.840 --> 24:42.560
You're not the first
one Mark's kicked around.

24:42.560 --> 24:45.120
He yells and gets respect.

24:45.120 --> 24:49.120
I took this job because I wanted to
run a department on my own.

24:50.080 --> 24:54.080
Now I'm not sure I'm ready.

24:54.400 --> 24:55.920
I've never been a dictator.

24:55.920 --> 24:57.880
Nobody expects you to be.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.800
What about everyone else?
That's up to you.

25:00.800 --> 25:04.800
Remember, we want you, and we're
behind you.

25:11.640 --> 25:15.640
I came to say goodbye.

25:15.680 --> 25:18.160
I'll try and drop by.

25:18.160 --> 25:19.600
Thor...

25:19.600 --> 25:21.600
Wait a second.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.640
Thor...

25:23.640 --> 25:27.640
who's...taking...care...of...Thor?

25:29.040 --> 25:33.040
I don't know.
I...want to go...home.

25:35.040 --> 25:36.400
Take him back to the ward.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.920
He's supposed to be at Brighton.

25:38.920 --> 25:42.920
I'm his doctor, and
I'm not releasing him. Now!

25:51.600 --> 25:54.280
You know, your family...

25:54.280 --> 25:57.280
A pain in the Acropolis.

25:57.280 --> 26:00.720
Appreciate your heritage.
I didn't have a family.

26:00.720 --> 26:03.720
There's much to be said for the
Uncle Nikoses of the world.

26:03.720 --> 26:05.000
Take him.

26:05.000 --> 26:09.000
He's sweet,
but who needs the moussaka?

26:09.080 --> 26:13.080
You don't know how
to let yourself have fun.

26:14.160 --> 26:17.480
You didn't do that well
rotating through psychiatry.

26:17.480 --> 26:21.280
You blamed everything
on breast-feeding.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.840
At work, you never
join in any reindeer games.

26:23.840 --> 26:27.840
And now you're standing like
Artemis waiting for the hunt.

26:28.920 --> 26:30.440
MUSIC STARTS

26:30.440 --> 26:33.040
Zorba.

26:33.040 --> 26:34.840
We should dance.
Only on your grave.

26:34.840 --> 26:35.960
You can't have fun.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.920
I can, too.
Come on.

26:37.920 --> 26:39.520
Ehrlich...

26:39.520 --> 26:43.520
One drink.

26:45.880 --> 26:47.760
Now smash the glass.

26:47.760 --> 26:50.400
On the floor, not my face.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.560
Ah!  Wasn't that fabulous?

26:52.560 --> 26:54.080
Well...

26:54.080 --> 26:58.080
Come on. Woo!

27:15.960 --> 27:16.960
KNOCK ON DOOR

27:16.960 --> 27:18.280
What do you want?

27:18.280 --> 27:20.320
Hi.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.560
Past your bedtime, isn't it?

27:23.560 --> 27:25.880
That day off put me behind.  You?

27:25.880 --> 27:29.880
I wanted to pack this tonight to
avoid making a show out of leaving.

27:32.240 --> 27:36.240
That's some Shanghai Lil
you and Daniel dredged up.

27:36.800 --> 27:39.760
You looked at her CV?

27:39.760 --> 27:42.720
I'm a married man.
Give her a chance.

27:42.720 --> 27:46.720
She's probably waiting to grab
my parking space.

27:47.040 --> 27:51.040
She glommed onto the job.
No respect for anybody.
Same as you.

27:51.920 --> 27:55.920
If this hand wasn't bandaged,
I'd knock your teeth out.

27:55.960 --> 27:58.200
Oh, come on.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.880
That's why you're packing now.

28:00.880 --> 28:04.280
You lost your temper over that
award, smashing your hand.

28:04.280 --> 28:07.280
Haven't you
learned anything from experience?

28:07.280 --> 28:09.920
Stop being so selfish.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.880
The hospital needs Dr Kiem.

28:12.880 --> 28:15.200
Which is more than I'll say for you.

28:15.200 --> 28:19.200
Get out.

28:30.240 --> 28:33.120
It's late, Sparky.

28:33.120 --> 28:37.120
Time to put your cover on.

28:39.320 --> 28:41.880
What's Dr Little Big Man doing?

28:41.880 --> 28:45.880
He's never here at this hour.

28:47.800 --> 28:49.360
He's packing.

28:49.360 --> 28:53.360
Personal things, plaques and all.

28:54.080 --> 28:56.760
What's he doing, Sparky?

28:56.760 --> 28:59.120
He can't be leaving.

28:59.120 --> 29:02.720
He couldn't be leaving.

29:02.720 --> 29:06.040
What about Miss Yellow Nightgown?

29:06.040 --> 29:08.320
Oh, she's reading.

29:08.320 --> 29:11.160
Maybe she doesn't know.

29:11.160 --> 29:15.160
What about her heart?
He can't leave Miss Yellow Nightgown.

29:17.200 --> 29:21.200
Dr Little Big Man's always
been there since we moved in.

29:21.800 --> 29:24.080
He can't abandon us.

29:24.080 --> 29:26.240
I'll have nowhere to turn.

29:26.240 --> 29:28.120
What about my heart?

29:28.120 --> 29:31.920
I've got to stop him...

29:31.920 --> 29:35.920
but I don't know his name.

29:36.280 --> 29:40.280
How will we find out his name?

29:42.800 --> 29:46.800
I'll ask for the heart doctor,
the one's who's leaving.

30:03.800 --> 30:07.800
PHONE RINGS

30:08.720 --> 30:12.040
Hello.

30:12.040 --> 30:15.480
Who?

30:15.480 --> 30:19.480
You live where?

30:24.880 --> 30:28.880
Are you out of your mind?

30:38.280 --> 30:42.280
His light went out.

30:45.480 --> 30:48.840
# Ba da bum bum... #

30:48.840 --> 30:50.200
Shh!

30:50.200 --> 30:52.880
Oh, this one, Victor Mature.

30:52.880 --> 30:54.760
How many ouzos did you have?

30:54.760 --> 30:58.120
Ouzos? Ah! Who knows?

30:58.120 --> 31:01.880
There you go.

31:01.880 --> 31:04.480
You know, you were right.

31:04.480 --> 31:06.920
I've never enjoyed
myself like that before.

31:06.920 --> 31:07.960
Well...

31:07.960 --> 31:10.840
You help me open up.

31:10.840 --> 31:14.320
I'll miss my bus.

31:14.320 --> 31:17.160
What are you doing?
Don't leave now.

31:17.160 --> 31:19.800
I think you're wonderful.
You are so drunk.

31:19.800 --> 31:22.600
No! I'm happy.

31:22.600 --> 31:24.320
I know what I'm doing.

31:24.320 --> 31:27.480
We could have a real good time.

31:27.480 --> 31:29.560
You'd hate me tomorrow.

31:29.560 --> 31:32.120
I know what I'm doing. I want you.

31:32.120 --> 31:36.120
Lucy...  Victor, let's swing.

31:41.600 --> 31:45.600
OK.

31:51.280 --> 31:53.320
Sorry I'm late.

31:53.320 --> 31:55.720
You know Mr Ewell's daughters.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.080
Yeah.

31:58.080 --> 32:00.880
Yesterday, everything was
set for my father to leave.

32:00.880 --> 32:04.240
Then we discover you
won't release him.

32:04.240 --> 32:05.880
He doesn't want to go to Shady Rest.

32:05.880 --> 32:07.120
He told you that?

32:07.120 --> 32:09.360
He wants to be at home with his dog.

32:09.360 --> 32:12.640
I'm sure he does.
But what can we do?

32:12.640 --> 32:14.520
Give him his wish.

32:14.520 --> 32:16.200
Katie and I can't afford
around the clock nurses.

32:16.200 --> 32:18.040
There are other ways.

32:18.040 --> 32:20.120
There are?

32:20.120 --> 32:22.720
Some people care for
terminally-ill relatives themselves.

32:22.720 --> 32:26.720
Us? We move into his house?

32:27.160 --> 32:29.880
You said he could live
like this for a long time.

32:29.880 --> 32:33.720
So you'd rather foist Mr Ewell
on strangers, huh?

32:33.720 --> 32:36.720
That's enough.

32:36.720 --> 32:39.520
This is hard on us, too.

32:39.520 --> 32:41.720
Of course.

32:41.720 --> 32:45.720
Would you excuse us, please?

32:49.040 --> 32:51.320
You can't let them shuffle him off.

32:51.320 --> 32:53.000
We don't have a choice.

32:53.000 --> 32:57.000
Mr Ewell's daughters
are his guardians.

32:57.040 --> 33:00.080
They have the legal right.

33:00.080 --> 33:01.640
Remember when I began
this community service?

33:01.640 --> 33:05.640
I couldn't take working with the
elderly. You made me do the work.

33:07.240 --> 33:11.240
Now I care, you say, "Don't."

33:16.560 --> 33:20.560
I'll expedite Mr Ewell's transfer
to the home today.

33:26.800 --> 33:30.200
Found McGyver's chart
in the gift shop.

33:30.200 --> 33:33.640
Ehrlich...
Good morning, pudding head.

33:33.640 --> 33:37.640
Ehrlich, in here!

33:38.040 --> 33:41.680
I fixed some Oaties...  How dare you!

33:41.680 --> 33:45.160
I left plenty.  You know what I mean!

33:45.160 --> 33:46.960
The throes of sexual bliss?

33:46.960 --> 33:49.680
I was drunk!

33:49.680 --> 33:52.240
You said you weren't!
You took advantage of me!

33:52.240 --> 33:54.680
I told you you'd hate me.
Hate you?

33:54.680 --> 33:56.520
I should turn you in to the
Bunco Squad.

33:56.520 --> 34:00.520
Look...
If I hear one joke, any comments,

34:03.320 --> 34:06.440
like the Iliad, I'll do a Hector
on your Achilles, you got that?

34:06.440 --> 34:10.440
Yes, ma'am.

34:13.080 --> 34:17.080
Guess she didn't
like my Trojan horse.

34:20.280 --> 34:23.400
The implant seeds are hard to locate.

34:23.400 --> 34:27.400
A little more exposure, please,
Jackie.

34:30.000 --> 34:32.080
That was a pun.

34:32.080 --> 34:34.920
I didn't get it.

34:34.920 --> 34:37.960
Do you always have such fun
in the OR?

34:37.960 --> 34:40.239
Dr Craig's not prone to humour.

34:40.239 --> 34:43.880
That's because he operates standing.

34:43.880 --> 34:47.560
Yeah. I get that one!

34:47.560 --> 34:50.080
My father would have liked him.

34:50.080 --> 34:54.080
The only thing Papa enjoyed more
than French cooking

34:54.400 --> 34:56.120
was American power.

34:56.120 --> 34:59.680
Neither did us much good.
Here's the next seed.

34:59.680 --> 35:03.680
The lead container, please.

35:04.360 --> 35:07.760
Hold the container away from you.

35:07.760 --> 35:10.520
Can I have the X-ray, please?

35:10.520 --> 35:13.560
Saigon. Scary place to live?

35:13.560 --> 35:16.600
Yes. No.

35:16.600 --> 35:19.320
But now I'm just a working mother.

35:19.320 --> 35:22.200
I miss my husband and my kids.

35:22.200 --> 35:24.280
I'll go to Maryland,

35:24.280 --> 35:26.920
some weekends they'll come up.

35:26.920 --> 35:28.520
You married?  Yes.

35:28.520 --> 35:31.480
I mean, we just separated.

35:31.480 --> 35:33.240
The truth is,

35:33.240 --> 35:36.600
I really don't know
what the truth is.

35:36.600 --> 35:39.160
Robert and I,

35:39.160 --> 35:42.480
we were such a team,
always giving back and forth.

35:42.480 --> 35:46.480
I balanced the cheque book,
he knew how to make hollandaise.

35:49.040 --> 35:50.080
I have to get him back.

35:50.080 --> 35:54.080
Here. Take the forceps.

35:55.040 --> 35:59.040
I'm not very steady right now.  Here.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.840
Just concentrate.

36:01.840 --> 36:05.120
Drop everything else out of focus.

36:05.120 --> 36:08.520
Just concentrate...

36:08.520 --> 36:12.520
on getting the seeds.

36:12.720 --> 36:14.600
Focus.

36:14.600 --> 36:17.640
Now see the breast.

36:17.640 --> 36:20.560
The tissue...the blood...

36:20.560 --> 36:24.560
I'm having difficulty.
You're trying too hard.

36:24.800 --> 36:26.280
Now keep going.

36:26.280 --> 36:29.040
Someone made a mistake.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.400
You're correcting that mistake.

36:32.400 --> 36:36.400
Going deep into the body to extract
the pain.

36:39.120 --> 36:43.120
Because of this, she'll be scarred.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.360
But she'll survive.

36:46.360 --> 36:48.120
I can't... It keeps slipping away.

36:48.120 --> 36:51.040
Don't let obstacles stop you.

36:51.040 --> 36:55.040
You're doing fine. You're calm.

36:56.960 --> 36:58.000
I've grasped it.

36:58.000 --> 37:02.000
Good.

37:12.840 --> 37:16.840
The attendants are
moving your father.

37:20.640 --> 37:22.520
Are we doing the right thing?

37:22.520 --> 37:24.240
I thought you'd made up your minds.

37:24.240 --> 37:28.240
No. Lorraine made the decision.

37:29.160 --> 37:31.920
She's better at thinking
in a crisis.

37:31.920 --> 37:35.920
When Mom died,
Lorraine made all the phone calls.

37:37.720 --> 37:39.360
I'm not like that.

37:39.360 --> 37:41.000
You have time.

37:41.000 --> 37:45.000
This can be a temporary decision.
I want to help Dad, but I'm scared.

37:45.760 --> 37:49.680
My life would change drastically.

37:49.680 --> 37:52.240
I had those questions
about my father.

37:52.240 --> 37:55.680
I'd just been married,
just starting my medical career.

37:55.680 --> 37:58.160
We had no money.

37:58.160 --> 38:00.440
There was no hope he'd recover.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.880
I gave up his apartment,

38:02.880 --> 38:06.880
sold his belongings
to pay for the care. He got better.

38:08.520 --> 38:12.440
I thought he'd be angry, but he
wasn't.

38:12.440 --> 38:16.000
He knew I'd done it out of love.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.720
Not obligation.

38:18.720 --> 38:22.720
Maybe figuring out the difference
will help you make a decision.

38:40.960 --> 38:44.960
Sparky, drink some water.

38:45.520 --> 38:49.280
I'm calling and calling all morning.

38:49.280 --> 38:53.280
If I can just tell him
how important he is...

38:54.240 --> 38:56.480
..about my heart...

38:56.480 --> 39:00.480
and how scary it is to be alone,
locked in.

39:02.200 --> 39:04.880
About the broken elevator,

39:04.880 --> 39:07.880
the stairs...

39:07.880 --> 39:11.880
maybe I can tell him
about the bad time

39:11.880 --> 39:14.640
when the boy followed me home,

39:14.640 --> 39:18.640
and he was there before
I could close the door.

39:18.800 --> 39:22.800
I set the groceries down
and there he was,

39:24.640 --> 39:28.640
polite-looking, like he was going
to say, "Please, may I help you?"

39:31.320 --> 39:35.320
If I could tell the doctor
why I need his touch...

39:37.640 --> 39:41.640
..maybe he'd stay.

39:48.680 --> 39:50.720
Hi.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.800
I'm all packed.

39:52.800 --> 39:56.800
Dr Craig, some woman called several
times this morning. Aimee Jeffries.

39:57.600 --> 40:00.160
Said it was about her heart,
she called you last night.

40:00.160 --> 40:01.720
Here's her number and address.

40:01.720 --> 40:05.720
She sounded upset.
I'll be gone for a while.

40:08.400 --> 40:10.560
I can't walk out the door, Donald.

40:10.560 --> 40:12.120
You'll be back.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.120
It's not that.

40:15.120 --> 40:19.120
I'm afraid this hospital
can get along without me.

40:20.120 --> 40:24.080
I thought I was indispensable,
too, until I went to Ethiopia.

40:24.080 --> 40:26.040
St Eligius continued, Mark.

40:26.040 --> 40:30.040
The place goes on, the people don't.

40:30.400 --> 40:33.280
Remember when we first came here?

40:33.280 --> 40:35.520
Young Turks.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.120
Impatient with the old geezers
whose hearts I was working on.

40:38.120 --> 40:42.120
They seemed so self-absorbed, myopic.

40:42.440 --> 40:46.440
I'm still working on the old
geezers, only now I'm one of them.

40:48.040 --> 40:52.040
My vision has narrowed
along with the rest of my life.

40:52.760 --> 40:56.760
BUZZER

40:57.200 --> 40:59.440
Yes.

40:59.440 --> 41:02.320
All right.  Be right there.

41:02.320 --> 41:05.360
Quality assurance reports.
They're not due for weeks.

41:05.360 --> 41:08.680
The computer's
shredding them right now.

41:08.680 --> 41:10.800
Don't worry.

41:10.800 --> 41:12.400
Go.

41:12.400 --> 41:15.360
It's not like I'm dying, right?

41:15.360 --> 41:19.360
Get well soon.

41:37.720 --> 41:41.360
There's another screw-up
about Dad's leaving.

41:41.360 --> 41:44.280
No, there isn't.

41:44.280 --> 41:48.120
I'm taking him back to his house.

41:48.120 --> 41:52.120
When we were kids and got sick,
Mom and Dad were always there.

41:53.600 --> 41:57.600
And they never turned
us over to anybody.

41:57.600 --> 42:01.440
He helped us begin our lives.

42:01.440 --> 42:04.400
We should help him end his.  Shh.

42:04.400 --> 42:05.920
He may hear you.

42:05.920 --> 42:09.920
Katie...Dad wouldn't want us to
sacrifice so much for him.

42:11.560 --> 42:14.080
I want to.
What about me?

42:14.080 --> 42:18.080
I can't nurse someone indefinitely.
He's our father.

42:18.240 --> 42:22.240
I know that. I do for my kids, but I
expect nothing in return.

42:23.960 --> 42:27.960
You took care of the situation when
I couldn't...

42:30.200 --> 42:31.960
..but now I'll take over.

42:31.960 --> 42:35.960
I've made up my mind.

42:38.160 --> 42:42.160
Fine.

42:43.400 --> 42:47.400
You handle it, then.

42:51.000 --> 42:52.200
Will you help me?

42:52.200 --> 42:56.200
Sure.

43:10.320 --> 43:14.320
We're taking you home, Daddy.

43:23.720 --> 43:26.520
I sincerely repent,

43:26.520 --> 43:30.520
and I promise to better my way of
life. I humbly ask thee,

43:31.800 --> 43:35.800
my spiritual father, saving
penance and absolution.

43:38.280 --> 43:41.400
The man you slept with,

43:41.400 --> 43:43.440
was this out of wedlock?

43:43.440 --> 43:45.080
Way out.

43:45.080 --> 43:49.080
I mean, yes, Father.

43:49.440 --> 43:52.280
Have you done such a thing before?

43:52.280 --> 43:56.280
With other men, yes,
but this was different.

43:56.920 --> 44:00.920
You know that sex outside of
marriage is not accepted

44:01.280 --> 44:03.240
by the Church.

44:03.240 --> 44:05.640
I do, yes.

44:05.640 --> 44:07.920
And I'm truly sorry

44:07.920 --> 44:10.320
because, you see,

44:10.320 --> 44:14.320
with this particular
man, the problem is...

44:14.440 --> 44:18.440
I liked it.

44:20.760 --> 44:24.760
Hmm.

44:25.200 --> 44:28.480
Oh, I wasn't expecting visitors.

44:28.480 --> 44:30.240
I neglected to clean.

44:30.240 --> 44:32.680
Uh...

44:32.680 --> 44:34.560
that's Sparky.

44:34.560 --> 44:38.560
Sparky, look who's come to see us to
make sure we're all right.

44:43.840 --> 44:47.840
There's your office over there. See?

44:50.760 --> 44:54.680
And all my other friends...

44:54.680 --> 44:56.520
Well...

44:56.520 --> 45:00.000
guess I'll make some tea.

45:00.000 --> 45:03.520
This is a very big day.

45:03.520 --> 45:07.520
Would you sit here,
and then we'll talk.

45:15.240 --> 45:19.240
Quite a view, isn't it?

45:20.360 --> 45:23.080
Yes.

45:23.080 --> 46:01.000
It's quite a view.
