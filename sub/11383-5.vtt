00:05.047 --> 00:06.503
You can be a daughter again.

We keep the lines straight.
The circles circling.

00:20.730 --> 00:22.220
None of this was foreseen.

00:22.565 --> 00:25.398
You’re walking
through a Red Forest.
The grass is tall.

00:25.902 --> 00:27.563
It is time, my son.

to be possible.

You promised
the cycle would hold.

01:40.643 --> 01:42.634
The virus was destroyed.

01:42.979 --> 01:46.142
We had to regroup,
move on to contingencies.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.685
This is not
what you foretold.

01:52.488 --> 01:53.989
What do you want from me?

01:59.161 --> 02:01.538
Why is she so important?

02:01.664 --> 02:04.827
Dr. Railly is a threat
to everything.
We should eliminate her.

your answers, darling?

02:19.223 --> 02:20.588
Of course not.

02:22.184 --> 02:25.893
The one who sees all
and knows all is asking us

02:26.397 --> 02:28.683
to see nothing
and know nothing.

02:29.859 --> 02:31.440
lt's chaos.

No, you're not getting it. No.

We know why The Messengers
went back in time.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.516
They're destroying Primaries,
people like you.

03:44.600 --> 03:47.467
Collapsing time,
creating paradoxes.

03:47.770 --> 03:50.386
You should come back
to the facility.
You'll be safer.

03:50.481 --> 03:53.348
You want me to move in?
I mean, it feels so sudden.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.522
It's not a joke.

03:54.610 --> 03:56.191
You've seen what's
happening outside,

03:56.278 --> 03:57.939
and if the Twelve Monkeys
ever got to you...

03:58.030 --> 03:59.941
They won't get me
with my Daughters around.

04:01.117 --> 04:03.324
My army is better than theirs.

04:03.452 --> 04:05.613
They got Tommy Crawford
in 1944.

04:05.704 --> 04:08.787
And if they paradox
even one more Primary,

04:09.458 --> 04:10.618

We don't know
how to find the others.
We're running out of time.

04:24.890 --> 04:27.472
Well, you need a guide.
Another Primary...

04:27.560 --> 04:29.846

Not this me.

04:29.979 --> 04:32.345
I'm no spring chicken anymore.

04:32.481 --> 04:35.143
Can't see 'em like
I used to in my head.

04:35.484 --> 04:37.145

04:41.407 --> 04:44.319
Now, she's got the touch.
She's got the power.

04:46.829 --> 04:47.989
So, that's it.

04:48.831 --> 04:51.072

Nope.

Not you.

04:57.256 --> 04:59.713

how she remembers it,
so that's how it has to be.

05:07.391 --> 05:09.723
Jennifer stayed in New York
after I left her there.

05:09.810 --> 05:12.051
She hung around the hotel bar
at the Emerson a lot.

05:12.146 --> 05:14.853

at risk.

off the board.

They're creating paradoxes,

12:52.814 --> 12:55.146
They killed one in 1944
named Tommy.

12:55.317 --> 12:56.932
He knew your name.

12:57.027 --> 12:58.642
I'm betting you know his.

12:58.987 --> 13:00.852
Poor Tommy.
Jennifer?

13:01.865 --> 13:02.980
Are you okay?

13:04.284 --> 13:06.821

Mr. Cole,

13:45.534 --> 13:49.152
very little in my life
consists of what I want.

13:49.871 --> 13:52.203
Mr. Deacon is an arrangement
of necessity.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.666
The longer the mission takes,

13:53.750 --> 13:57.117
the more vulnerable
this facility becomes
to the dying world outside.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.045
Deacon being here
makes the facility
more vulnerable,

14:00.132 --> 14:01.588
from the inside and out.

14:01.675 --> 14:03.757
You think the Foreman's
the only guy looking for him?

He's dangerous.
He's a savage.

you first arrived here.

I'm not going to debate
this any longer.

Time and space is
tearing itself apart.
That needs to be our focus.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.682
For now, you will just
have to figure out how
to work with Mr. Deacon.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.070
She's gonna let it go,
isntshe?

14:26.992 --> 14:28.528
That is bullshit.

Bullshit!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.076
All right, all right.

14:32.164 --> 14:34.325

a second chance.

14:34.416 --> 14:35.496
He ain't gonna
change, brother.

14:36.585 --> 14:39.076
Clem was an idiot,
but he wasn't wrong.

14:39.296 --> 14:41.412
Deacon's got a lot
of enemies, doesn't he?

14:41.631 --> 14:43.838
Yeah. The Foreman.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.634
We don't need him
or his marauders anywhere
near this place.

14:49.514 --> 14:52.506
Listen to me, brother.
I know you want everything
to be Kumbaya.

14:52.893 --> 14:56.886
There is no Kumbaya
as long as Deacon's
still here.

14:57.272 --> 14:58.603
And you know that.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.110
Guess you can't trust anyone.

Don't know about Primaries.

Said you could
tell me everything
about the other Primaries.

left out the part
