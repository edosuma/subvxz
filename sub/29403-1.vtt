WEBVTT

02:45.666 --> 02:46.701
Good morning.

07:27.447 --> 07:28.653
Calm down!

07:36.915 --> 07:38.076
Woman!

07:51.930 --> 07:54.592
If you want to help me,
it has to be now.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.180
They are looking for me.

07:57.352 --> 07:58.467
What did you do?

07:58.561 --> 08:00.552
I knocked out the power lines.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.099
- So it's you?
- Yes.

08:07.237 --> 08:08.477
It's the 5th time.

08:09.322 --> 08:10.812
- You are in this alone?
- Yes.

08:13.368 --> 08:15.609
You want to make me
an accomplice?

08:15.704 --> 08:19.993
I'm not a criminal, I'm trying
to stop crimes against us.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.289
Who are your kin?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.211
My name is Halla,

08:27.132 --> 08:29.123
I'm the daughter of Benedikt Sigurésson.

08:29.843 --> 08:31.379
My grandmother is from here.

08:31.720 --> 08:34.256
So you're Eyvl'k's stock.

08:34.389 --> 08:36.005
I know your people.

08:36.349 --> 08:37.714
So you're Bensi's daughter...

08:37.767 --> 08:39.256
What I have done,

08:39.769 --> 08:42.431
I believe with all my heart
to be right.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.282
Woman!

09:00.373 --> 09:01.863
Bark!

09:23.229 --> 09:25.095
Woman! Bark!

09:54.803 --> 09:57.966
They saw your trail on the heath
heading down here.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.178
They're going to send
the bloodhounds,

10:03.144 --> 10:05.431
so you are not invited to stay.

10:05.980 --> 10:07.687
I can't spare the Jeep.

10:10.527 --> 10:12.234
I can lend you this one.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.900
You return it when you can.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.023
Before the next
Independence Day.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.030
You have to get a feel
for the clutch.

10:25.125 --> 10:27.457
I can say I stole it.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.330
It's up to you.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.036
Thanks for your help.

10:35.176 --> 10:37.133
We don't talk about it much
around here,

10:37.762 --> 10:40.299
but probably my father
was not his father's son.

10:41.391 --> 10:43.723
Your grandfather,
Siguréur from Eyvl'k,

10:43.852 --> 10:46.469
was a man of extremes
like most of his kin

10:47.230 --> 10:50.723
and stepped in for
a few husbands around here.

10:51.734 --> 10:54.146
So you and me could be
second cousins.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.398
Really!

10:56.531 --> 10:58.021
So thank you, cousin.

10:58.158 --> 10:59.648
Alleged cousin.

10:59.909 --> 11:03.447
Let's see if this will be
of any help.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.079
Woman!

11:13.298 --> 11:14.288
Sta-Y-

11:31.482 --> 11:36.773
<i>Authorities have acknowledged
that the repeated outages</i>

11:36.905 --> 11:39.192
<i>are the result
of organized sabotage.</i>

11:39.324 --> 11:41.816
<i>Yet, no one has claimed
responsibility so far.</i>

11:41.951 --> 11:44.443
<i>Porbjérn Gislason,
shift manager at the smelter:</i>

11:44.579 --> 11:46.536
<i>Was there less damage
this time?</i>

11:46.581 --> 11:47.446
<i>Yes.</i>

11:47.540 --> 11:50.248
<i>But it's very expensive
to run it on oil,</i>

11:50.376 --> 11:53.960
<i>still it's better than
the cooling of the metal.</i>

11:54.088 --> 11:55.499
<i>That would be a huge loss.</i>

11:56.049 --> 11:59.337
<i>According to our sources,
a man has been arrested</i>

11:59.385 --> 12:00.671
<i>following the outage.</i>

12:00.803 --> 12:03.761
<i>A foreign male
was brought in for questioning.</i>

12:05.934 --> 12:07.800
So sorry, darlings,
I'm late.

12:08.186 --> 12:09.176
<i>Mea culpa.</i>

12:09.562 --> 12:10.597
Have you warmed up?

12:11.314 --> 12:14.477
Great! Let's start
with a small spring song

12:14.609 --> 12:16.099
to heat up the soul.

13:09.747 --> 13:10.612
So, dear friends.

13:10.748 --> 13:13.581
"The land of flora
and the land of my brother".

13:13.710 --> 13:15.496
There's a difference.
Learn it.

13:15.837 --> 13:19.751
A small break,
I need to make some copies.

13:19.882 --> 13:22.340
Baldvin, can you help me?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.592
"Baldwinner" all the time.

13:24.721 --> 13:28.214
Not bad to have a ministry man
for the paperwork.

13:33.521 --> 13:35.888
What was the helicopter
doing there?

13:36.065 --> 13:38.773
Some accident at Laugarvatn.
I didn't know.

13:38.901 --> 13:41.438
- This was too close.
- I know.

13:41.571 --> 13:43.027
You have to stop now!

13:43.156 --> 13:45.989
The Americans will monitor
the highlands from space.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.610
They've ordered a satellite
and thermal cameras.

13:49.746 --> 13:51.282
The lines will be monitored.

13:53.833 --> 13:55.619
When is the satellite expected?

13:55.835 --> 13:58.167
I don't know.
One week, maybe less.

13:58.296 --> 13:59.627
Can it see through clouds?

14:01.632 --> 14:03.669
That's not a chance
you can take.

14:04.260 --> 14:07.127
Your mission is accomplished.
The Chinese have withdrawn.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.971
They have just postponed.
They are still here.

14:10.099 --> 14:13.933
It's just diplomacy. They
consider the country unsafe.

14:14.062 --> 14:16.269
It's not just
between Iceland and China,

14:16.397 --> 14:17.683
there is more at stake.

14:17.774 --> 14:22.018
Rio Tinto is threatening to sue
for billions.

14:22.153 --> 14:24.190
You don't need to go on!

14:24.322 --> 14:28.281
It's all over the media,
everybody is freaking out.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.162
And you?

14:34.916 --> 14:35.906
And me what?

14:36.042 --> 14:37.373
Are you taking your medication?

14:38.753 --> 14:42.838
Yes... no.
I'm cutting down to 25mg.

14:43.091 --> 14:44.331
It's going fine.

14:44.467 --> 14:45.548
Listen,

14:45.676 --> 14:48.543
you don't get
what is going on...

14:48.596 --> 14:50.178
They've got generators now.

14:50.848 --> 14:53.806
The next time
I need to bring down the pylons

14:53.851 --> 14:54.807
for some real damage.

14:54.852 --> 14:56.763
We have to finish the plan.

14:57.105 --> 14:59.392
Now the whole world is watching,

14:59.732 --> 15:01.689
it's the perfect time
for your manifesto.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.109
And then you stop.

15:04.445 --> 15:08.063
If they catch you now, they will
silence the whole thing.

15:17.959 --> 15:19.074
I'll think it over.

15:20.670 --> 15:22.661
Think?
There's nothing to think about!

15:23.589 --> 15:26.923
I know these people, I'm
surrounded by those psychopaths

15:27.051 --> 15:28.007
all day long.

15:28.136 --> 15:29.501
I know how they think,

15:29.637 --> 15:30.968
don't underestimate them.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.095
Is it connected to the internet?

15:36.727 --> 15:38.468
No. I checked.

15:40.440 --> 15:42.932
Baldvin, it is secure.

15:43.526 --> 15:45.312
I know what I'm doing.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.815
You can never be sure.

15:52.493 --> 15:53.358
Are you ready?

15:53.744 --> 15:54.825
Yes.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.741
We flip the page.

17:29.632 --> 17:30.622
Cool car.

17:35.054 --> 17:35.919
Yes.

17:37.098 --> 17:38.259
You know who owns it?

17:38.933 --> 17:40.423
No, no idea.

18:19.974 --> 18:21.180
<i>These are criminal activities</i>

18:21.434 --> 18:24.927
<i>and those organized crimes
against the Icelandic nation</i>

18:25.062 --> 18:26.552
<i>will be met with full force.</i>

18:27.565 --> 18:31.980
<i>The negotiations with the
Chinese are momentarily on hold.</i>

18:32.069 --> 18:33.480
<i>The government is determined</i>

18:33.529 --> 18:34.985
<i>to continue
its industrial development.</i>

18:35.072 --> 18:36.813
<i>The government's statement has</i>

18:36.866 --> 18:38.982
<i>attracted the attention
of the media.</i>

18:39.368 --> 18:43.737
<i>In Germany they speak about
the Green Army and the BBC...</i>

18:46.667 --> 18:47.623
<i>It's scandalous</i>

18:47.710 --> 18:50.828
<i>that the government isn't
admitting this is sabotage.</i>

18:51.339 --> 18:55.173
<i>It's an attack on the heavy
industry in Iceland.</i>

18:55.551 --> 18:59.260
<i>Nobody will want to invest
in our industry in the future.</i>

19:33.923 --> 19:35.038
speaking.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.134
Yes, good afternoon.

19:42.390 --> 19:44.552
A letter? No, I haven't received
any letter.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.392
I had made an application,
but it was 4 years ago.

19:50.606 --> 19:52.722
I'll double-check the mail.

19:58.572 --> 19:59.858
Let me see.. .

20:00.533 --> 20:02.695
Wait, I'll check
in another place...

20:22.263 --> 20:23.469
Oh, my God.

20:24.765 --> 20:26.051
A girl...

20:27.017 --> 20:29.850
Yes, I have it here.

20:31.105 --> 20:33.938
I have to note it down.
Tomorrow morning?

20:34.024 --> 20:36.231
Yes, I will remember. At 11?

20:37.695 --> 20:39.606
<i>And so...</i>

20:40.906 --> 20:42.112
How old is she?

20:43.951 --> 20:46.739
So, 4 years old...
Yes, it's written here.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.242
Thank you. See you.

22:36.814 --> 22:41.354
Yes, I have to look at this...

22:44.071 --> 22:48.565
I haven't thought about it
for 4 years now.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.527
You don't have much time
to think it over.

22:52.788 --> 22:54.950
We need an answer soon.

22:55.624 --> 22:58.412
If you're not adopting, we need
to find another candidate.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.086
Yes, I understand.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.041
So much has changed since then.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.261
Here is the folder
with all the information

23:14.351 --> 23:16.342
from the Ukrainian institute.

23:17.104 --> 23:21.348
If you accept, you need
to provide the following papers:

23:21.400 --> 23:23.812
a recent criminal record,
a bill of health

23:24.153 --> 23:25.689
and a statement

23:25.988 --> 23:28.195
that you are still single.

23:28.240 --> 23:29.947
Yes, it's still the case.

23:30.200 --> 23:33.067
So we need a new signature

23:33.162 --> 23:35.995
from your back-up custodian.

23:37.207 --> 23:39.073
The form is right here.

23:39.460 --> 23:41.701
Presumably
it's still your sister?

23:42.630 --> 23:43.495
Yes.

23:43.547 --> 23:46.005
And you will still be her
back-up

23:46.258 --> 23:48.090
if her application goes through?

23:48.469 --> 23:49.379
What?

23:49.845 --> 23:51.677
She also has
an application pending.

23:51.805 --> 23:54.137
You both applied at the same
time, if I recall?

23:54.808 --> 23:59.223
Yes, nothing has changed,
but I'm not so sure...

23:59.313 --> 24:01.975
- I can't answer for her.
- I understand.

24:02.399 --> 24:04.356
Very well. So here it is...

24:05.194 --> 24:09.984
You have a photo of the little
girl and some information.

24:11.450 --> 24:16.035
She's from the Donetsk region,
from a town called Drouj...

24:17.081 --> 24:18.321
<i>...kivka.</i>

24:19.083 --> 24:23.828
She lost both her parents
in the war.

24:25.130 --> 24:28.589
She was found
with her grandmother,

24:29.510 --> 24:33.094
who had been dead for some days.

24:34.848 --> 24:36.304
So there is

24:37.685 --> 24:40.347
some trauma
that needs to be taken care of.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.267
But she is clearly
a little hero.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.111
Very good.

27:03.288 --> 27:04.494
Now we lie back.

27:09.169 --> 27:13.788
And we release
all the weight of our body

27:15.259 --> 27:17.591
to Mother Earth.

27:17.970 --> 27:19.460
I need to talk to you.

27:19.555 --> 27:21.512
Me too. In a bit.

27:22.516 --> 27:24.132
We relax...

27:26.770 --> 27:28.761
We breathe in the light.

27:30.774 --> 27:32.435
We breathe out.

27:34.695 --> 27:35.810
We trust...

27:35.946 --> 27:38.904
- I'm waiting in the garden.
- I come in 5 minutes.

27:53.463 --> 27:55.249
- Can I begin?
- Yes.

27:55.632 --> 27:56.997
They changed the rules.

27:57.467 --> 27:58.502
The rules have changed,

27:58.594 --> 28:00.835
and a little girl is waiting
in Ukraine.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.178
We are not too old in Ukraine.
Not anymore.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.220
How wonderful!

28:11.398 --> 28:14.481
I knew there was something
going on.

28:14.776 --> 28:17.268
I've been dreaming of you
lately, as if something

28:17.696 --> 28:20.404
very important was going
to happen

28:21.033 --> 28:22.523
and now it has happened.

28:23.076 --> 28:24.612
My dear Halla,

28:25.829 --> 28:27.319
you're going to be a morn.

28:28.540 --> 28:30.577
You too,
we applied at the same time,

28:30.667 --> 28:32.157
you must be next in line.

28:32.753 --> 28:34.619
I also have big news for you.

28:36.089 --> 28:39.957
I've been accepted into the
Maharishi Ashram in India.

28:42.930 --> 28:45.171
- What? With the gurus?
- Yes.

28:45.515 --> 28:47.927
I'll have the guidance
of Tony Nader,

28:48.352 --> 28:50.184
I will be away for two years.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.678
Totally secluded from the world.

28:52.773 --> 28:54.309
You're joining a convent?

28:55.067 --> 28:56.148
You could say that.

28:59.488 --> 29:01.104
<i>But we...</i>

29:01.448 --> 29:05.066
You are my back-up custodian.

29:05.535 --> 29:07.993
I can be the auntie abroad
until I come home.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.538
What's her name?

29:26.306 --> 29:27.967
You have a photo?

29:32.813 --> 29:34.019
She's holding a flower.

29:34.648 --> 29:35.683
She looks just like you.

29:35.899 --> 29:36.934
And you.

29:38.068 --> 29:39.809
She looks just like us.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.020
Her name is Nika.

29:45.492 --> 29:47.654
She's alone in the world.

29:47.953 --> 29:50.536
She lost everything in the war.

29:50.664 --> 29:52.996
Her morn, her dad, her grandma.

29:56.336 --> 29:57.952
Nika, daughter of Halla.

29:58.463 --> 29:59.419
It's just that...

30:01.842 --> 30:03.298
It's all so complicated now.

30:03.719 --> 30:04.800
What do you mean?

30:05.721 --> 30:07.086
What is complicated?

30:07.514 --> 30:08.549
Tell me.

30:11.977 --> 30:13.433
I think I need help.

30:17.232 --> 30:19.223
We all need to find
our own path.

30:19.318 --> 30:22.151
My journey is an inner one,
to face myself.

30:22.195 --> 30:25.187
Your journey will be to Ukraine
to this little girl.

30:25.324 --> 30:26.940
Will you sign the form again?

30:27.284 --> 30:28.240
What?

30:28.702 --> 30:31.569
The papers saying that you are
my back-up custodian.

30:31.663 --> 30:35.372
Of course I will sign.
But you don't need anyone else.

30:35.751 --> 30:37.492
You know that you can do it.

30:37.586 --> 30:40.578
You're the mom
and nothing will stop you.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.747
What did Mom always say?

30:45.635 --> 30:46.670
Say it.

30:47.429 --> 30:48.919
Moms can do anything.

30:49.139 --> 30:50.629
No, the other thing.

30:52.893 --> 30:54.975
- Find solutions.
- Exactly.

31:32.557 --> 31:34.298
THE ALUMINUM SMELTER
OUT OF POWER

31:34.559 --> 31:36.596
FOREIGN TERRORIST OPERATION?

31:37.270 --> 31:38.886
THE CIA HELPS THE POLICE

31:40.148 --> 31:41.604
A NATION KEPT HOSTAGE

31:47.948 --> 31:49.438
DECLARATION

32:24.901 --> 32:26.562
Are you looking for something?

32:26.862 --> 32:28.728
No, nothing special today.

32:29.072 --> 32:30.858
You're always welcome.

32:44.754 --> 32:45.789
Goodbye.

33:05.692 --> 33:07.649
I've got to run. See you later.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.693
You're always welcome.

33:28.798 --> 33:31.881
I declare that I'm solely
responsible for the sabotage

33:31.968 --> 33:34.551
enacted upon
the country's power lines.

33:36.932 --> 33:38.263
The world will know

33:38.350 --> 33:40.762
that heavy industry
in Iceland will be costly...

37:40.759 --> 37:42.045
DECLARATION

37:58.067 --> 37:59.353
"I declare...

38:00.528 --> 38:02.018
"that I'm solely responsible...

38:03.031 --> 38:04.942
"that my actions are
only aimed at..."

38:14.542 --> 38:18.035
"The acts of sabotage
are a crime against humanity..."

38:18.129 --> 38:19.085
Good.

38:22.592 --> 38:25.630
"The driving force behind these
hellish acts is not democratic."

38:25.804 --> 38:26.839
No!

39:22.151 --> 39:24.609
"I urge everyone to rise up

39:24.737 --> 39:26.227
"and use their ingenuity

39:26.281 --> 39:28.397
"to cause damage
to these enterprises.

39:28.616 --> 39:30.948
"That's the only thing
those psychopaths,

39:31.077 --> 39:32.863
"those global multinationals,
can understand.

39:33.037 --> 39:34.778
"That's how they operate,

39:34.873 --> 39:37.911
"with threats and sabotage
against nature and society."

39:39.752 --> 39:41.743
- It's over?
- No, it's...

39:41.880 --> 39:43.791
I got a signal.

39:43.840 --> 39:44.830
Keep on.

39:45.466 --> 39:49.175
"The sabotage against our nature
causing atmospheric warming

39:49.512 --> 39:52.675
"is a crime against humanity
and all life on Earth.

39:53.099 --> 39:55.215
"The globalized industry

39:55.268 --> 39:57.225
"is the force behind
this suicidal charge

39:57.562 --> 40:00.224
"that not even democracy
can stop."

40:00.398 --> 40:01.684
It's incredible.

40:01.858 --> 40:04.225
"But there are laws..."

40:04.319 --> 40:05.525
You're skipping something.

40:05.904 --> 40:08.612
"There are laws
above human laws,

40:08.740 --> 40:11.482
"ancestral laws which will not
be stricken out tomorrow.

40:11.951 --> 40:15.114
"It's our indisputable right
to protect the lives

40:15.204 --> 40:16.990
"of future generations.

40:17.665 --> 40:21.659
"We are the most powerful
generation ever

40:22.045 --> 40:23.877
"and we are also
the last generation

40:24.088 --> 40:27.171
"that can stop
the war against our Earth.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.841
"Our children and grandchildren
will have no chance.

40:30.094 --> 40:31.926
"For them it will be too late.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.717
"Now is the time,
the mission is ours.

40:37.101 --> 40:38.091
"The Mountain Woman."

40:46.152 --> 40:47.438
We can bury this.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.397
How?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.484
I need to make a confession.

41:37.495 --> 41:41.454
I have a secret
I can't keep quiet any longer.

41:47.672 --> 41:50.255
As you know, I have...

41:52.885 --> 41:56.003
I've had a dream
for a long time,

41:56.097 --> 41:58.338
but I thought
it would never come true,

41:59.434 --> 42:00.845
until two days ago.

42:02.812 --> 42:06.680
There is a little girl
in Ukraine

42:08.484 --> 42:10.191
who needs a mother,

42:10.737 --> 42:13.069
and the morn happens to be me.

42:16.117 --> 42:17.699
Congratulations!

42:19.078 --> 42:20.614
Her name is Nika.

42:21.581 --> 42:23.242
She's beautiful!

42:24.125 --> 42:25.615
She is 4 years old.

42:27.879 --> 42:31.372
I will go get her next week,

42:31.507 --> 42:33.794
so we need to postpone
our summer concert.

42:34.552 --> 42:36.259
She's going to be a mom!

43:06.084 --> 43:07.370
Who is this tourist?

43:07.668 --> 43:09.033
This is not a joke.

43:10.421 --> 43:14.210
Some American has taken over the
investigation and Israelis too.

43:14.842 --> 43:16.424
They're analyzing the paper.

43:17.053 --> 43:19.260
Why did you use
an old typewriter?

43:19.347 --> 43:21.054
- It can be traced.
- Stop.

43:21.474 --> 43:22.930
No one will trace it.

43:24.268 --> 43:27.351
Why didn't you
let me read it before?

43:27.480 --> 43:30.472
I just had to get it out,
the timing was crucial.

43:30.566 --> 43:31.772
And then the girl came...

43:31.859 --> 43:35.227
But there are weak points
they will tear apart.

43:35.696 --> 43:37.937
- Like what?
- The laws about laws...

43:38.366 --> 43:41.233
You're opening up
a very dangerous angle,

43:41.410 --> 43:43.276
they will totally deform it.

43:43.412 --> 43:45.073
People will understand.

43:45.248 --> 43:47.785
I've planted the seeds,
it can't be stopped.

43:47.875 --> 43:49.536
They don't want to stop it,

43:49.710 --> 43:52.919
but to control it. They will
control the discussion.

43:53.047 --> 43:56.711
What will be discussed?
The real issues.

43:56.843 --> 43:59.710
Who will tell us
what the real issues are?

44:08.020 --> 44:09.806
They've started
a mole investigation.

44:11.190 --> 44:12.931
The ministry is out of the loop.

44:13.067 --> 44:14.432
Are you a suspect?

44:14.569 --> 44:16.651
I don't know.
Everybody is a suspect.

44:19.073 --> 44:20.404
I can't anymore,

44:21.075 --> 44:22.782
I just can't do it anymore.

44:28.875 --> 44:30.331
If they identify me,

44:30.459 --> 44:31.995
they will identify you.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.369
- We are too close.
- We will stop it.

44:35.882 --> 44:37.919
- I promise.
- You have to leave.

44:41.345 --> 44:42.380
Please leave.

45:14.253 --> 45:17.120
<i>It's clear that
there will be cuts in wages</i>

45:17.340 --> 45:18.956
<i>because of this Mountain Woman.</i>

45:19.133 --> 45:21.374
<i>It's an attack
on wage-earning people.</i>

45:21.719 --> 45:25.007
<i>The Bank of Iceland projects
a plunge in its credit rating.</i>

45:25.139 --> 45:28.848
<i>It will be rated at the bottom
if energy isn't delivered.</i>

45:28.976 --> 45:34.142
<i>Hydraulic energy is
very ecological.</i>

45:34.273 --> 45:35.559
<i>Nothing makes sense.</i>

45:36.525 --> 45:39.688
<i>We will emit
less greenhouse gases.</i>

45:41.364 --> 45:43.275
<i>All this violence...</i>

45:43.407 --> 45:45.398
<i>Democracy is
the principal issue.</i>

45:45.493 --> 45:49.236
<i>There are laws superior
to human laws.</i>

45:49.372 --> 45:52.160
<i>What are those? Divine laws?
Or sharia laws?</i>

45:53.584 --> 45:58.624
<i>Do we have to stop all industry
and go back to our turf houses?</i>

46:33.332 --> 46:34.743
You don't answer the phone?

46:35.793 --> 46:37.375
I forgot it at home.

46:47.346 --> 46:48.962
Will you bring her
some clothes?

46:49.015 --> 46:49.880
Yes.

46:53.185 --> 46:54.425
What size?

46:55.896 --> 46:57.011
I don't know.

46:58.190 --> 47:01.148
She's 97cm and <i>22</i> kilos.

47:02.194 --> 47:03.525
Tiny little creature.

47:04.238 --> 47:05.899
She wouldn't touch
the bottom of the pool.

47:21.005 --> 47:21.995
Mommy!

47:30.681 --> 47:31.762
Hello!

47:36.771 --> 47:39.229
Sirry!
So you were in the locker?

47:39.357 --> 47:40.643
Come here.

47:40.900 --> 47:41.856
How old are you?

47:42.068 --> 47:43.024
4 years old.

47:43.152 --> 47:45.519
4 years old?
You have nice little feet.

47:46.030 --> 47:46.895
Can I see?

47:49.492 --> 47:50.903
And her shoe size?

47:51.035 --> 47:52.321
25 - 26.

47:52.661 --> 47:54.277
They grow fast at this age.

47:54.705 --> 47:55.740
Yes, it's true.

47:56.165 --> 47:57.496
Yes, really.

47:57.625 --> 47:59.866
Children's shoes
are so expensive,

48:00.544 --> 48:02.785
and it will get worse
with this Mountain Woman.

48:03.005 --> 48:05.042
Yes, it's sad.

48:05.174 --> 48:06.835
It's dreadful.

48:07.718 --> 48:09.174
What's dreadful?

48:09.303 --> 48:10.509
This violence.

48:10.638 --> 48:13.346
This violence?
It's just sabotage.

48:13.974 --> 48:15.260
Just sabotage?

48:15.643 --> 48:17.225
Economic sabotage.

48:18.896 --> 48:21.604
It's extremism,
which breeds extremism.

48:21.732 --> 48:24.394
He who lives by the sword,
dies by the sword.

48:24.527 --> 48:26.768
But no one has been hurt,

48:26.904 --> 48:28.440
except our country
and our planet.

48:29.448 --> 48:32.406
It's not the right way
to solve this problem.

48:32.618 --> 48:35.235
Meditating in some convent,
will that change something?

48:36.247 --> 48:38.989
It will change me
and thus the world I hope.

48:39.083 --> 48:42.576
Isn't that egoism, to think
it will change the world?

48:42.711 --> 48:44.327
The drop hollows the stone.

48:44.463 --> 48:45.669
The stone?

48:45.798 --> 48:49.132
The mountains are falling on us,

48:49.260 --> 48:51.752
we don't have time
to wait for drops.

48:51.887 --> 48:55.926
Now you're going to save a child
and the entire world with it.

48:56.392 --> 48:59.225
Isn't that a small drop
or is it just vanity?

48:59.353 --> 49:01.685
At least I'm doing something
for someone else.

49:37.057 --> 49:40.675
<i>We must not let
this kind of terror</i>

49:40.811 --> 49:43.098
<i>turn our society into a jungle</i>

49:43.230 --> 49:45.471
<i>where the strongest steer
the course.</i>

49:45.608 --> 49:46.973
<i>That's the main issue.</i>

49:47.109 --> 49:50.192
<i>Mr Prime Minister,
what are your projects</i>

49:50.321 --> 49:52.779
<i>concerning global warming?</i>

49:52.907 --> 49:56.116
<i>It's the reason
for these acts of sabotage.</i>

49:57.244 --> 49:59.656
<i>We will not discuss
the environmental issues</i>

50:00.289 --> 50:03.247
<i>until we know how
to tackle this violence</i>

50:04.210 --> 50:05.792
<i>as a nation.</i>

50:06.504 --> 50:08.211
<i>That is the main issue.</i>

50:08.506 --> 50:09.837
<i>The most important</i>

50:10.216 --> 50:13.675
<i>is that we rally behind
the democratic ideal.</i>

50:14.220 --> 50:17.053
<i>That is precisely what AI-Qaeda
and Isis suggest</i>

50:17.181 --> 50:18.592
<i>and are doing.</i>

50:18.724 --> 50:22.217
<i>But an example close to home
is of course Anders Breivik</i>

50:22.394 --> 50:26.012
<i>who in this context
is the Norwegian Mountain King.</i>

50:41.247 --> 50:45.866
<i>Those technical changes will
enable us to safeguard against</i>

50:46.001 --> 50:47.617
<i>an electricity outage</i>

50:47.753 --> 50:50.711
<i>and increase the power
of electricity transport.</i>

50:50.839 --> 50:53.706
<i>So there will be no way
to knock out a smelter</i>

50:54.009 --> 50:56.501
<i>and hold
an entire nation hostage.</i>

50:56.804 --> 51:00.923
<i>Not only do the negotiations
with the Chinese go on</i>

51:01.058 --> 51:04.722
<i>but Rio Tinto will enlarge
its aluminum smelter.</i>

51:05.437 --> 51:07.303
<i>The country is rising again!</i>

51:08.190 --> 51:09.430
<i>Thank you!</i>

52:34.693 --> 52:38.152
I need more of those,
six indoor plants

52:38.197 --> 52:41.610
and 25kg of chicken manure
to put in the trunk,

52:41.825 --> 52:42.781
please.

52:43.285 --> 52:44.320
Chicken manure.

53:02.554 --> 53:06.218
<i>According to the Bléndués police,
there was a break in</i>

53:06.350 --> 53:09.559
<i>at the Road Administration
storage last night.</i>

53:09.687 --> 53:12.179
<i>A great quantity of Semtex
was stolen.</i>

53:12.314 --> 53:15.022
<i>The Civil Protection
have issued an alert</i>

53:15.150 --> 53:17.482
<i>of possible sabotage</i>

53:17.611 --> 53:20.228
<i>and has put up road blocks.</i>

53:20.364 --> 53:22.696
<i>People are urged to call
the police</i>

53:22.741 --> 53:25.358
<i>if they see something unusual</i>

53:25.494 --> 53:27.451
<i>but not to engage suspects</i>

53:27.579 --> 53:29.786
<i>as they might be armed
and dangerous.</i>

53:42.511 --> 53:44.093
Where are you going?

53:44.221 --> 53:45.586
It's a secret.

53:45.723 --> 53:49.057
A flowery, surprise birthday
present for my cousin.

53:49.727 --> 53:51.434
Who is your cousin?

53:52.104 --> 53:53.435
Sveinbjérn Asmunds...

53:53.564 --> 53:55.475
Asmundsson.
From Brusastaéir in Pingvallasveit.

53:55.733 --> 53:57.315
Sveinbjérn, I know him.

53:57.526 --> 53:58.391
Really?

53:58.444 --> 54:00.230
- You two are related?
- Yes.

54:02.948 --> 54:04.234
Can you open the trunk?

54:05.075 --> 54:06.406
I know what it is.

54:07.077 --> 54:08.033
<i>Mea culpa.</i>

54:14.042 --> 54:15.123
I know!

54:16.628 --> 54:20.337
You can't offer flowers
without fertilizer.

54:20.466 --> 54:21.422
Go right ahead.

54:21.550 --> 54:23.086
So I'm free to go?

54:23.218 --> 54:24.583
Great! Thank you!

54:36.607 --> 54:37.563
Shut up!

54:46.033 --> 54:46.898
What's wrong?

54:54.333 --> 54:55.789
What are you trying to say?

55:12.726 --> 55:15.593
THANK YOU

59:04.166 --> 59:05.531
You're under arrest!

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:34.219
Pick up!

01:05:34.889 --> 01:05:36.630
Pick up signal at 2 o'clock.

01:05:50.530 --> 01:05:51.565
Negative.

01:06:50.757 --> 01:06:52.247
Wait! There!

01:06:53.301 --> 01:06:54.336
Is something there?

01:06:57.555 --> 01:06:58.545
Negative.

01:06:58.681 --> 01:07:01.594
Another bloody sheep!
They're everywhere.

01:07:01.726 --> 01:07:04.013
They must stop them
from running all over the place.

01:09:53.731 --> 01:09:55.347
Come, we don't have much time.

01:09:56.192 --> 01:09:57.057
Thanks.

01:09:57.110 --> 01:09:58.475
You're not out of this yet.

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.226
How did you find me?

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:04.648
I know my land,
I figured you'd come down here.

01:10:05.284 --> 01:10:06.490
I'm freezing.

01:10:06.577 --> 01:10:07.658
Here.

01:10:08.162 --> 01:10:09.698
Squeeze down in the middle.

01:10:11.165 --> 01:10:12.951
They're down there.

01:10:13.918 --> 01:10:17.411
When they stop us, don't move.

01:10:17.463 --> 01:10:18.328
Woman!

01:10:21.884 --> 01:10:23.045
Come here!

01:10:23.636 --> 01:10:25.218
Come in the car!

01:10:45.241 --> 01:10:46.572
Where are you heading?

01:10:47.243 --> 01:10:50.656
I wanted to bring some sheep up
there, but I had to turn back.

01:10:51.038 --> 01:10:52.153
Woman!

01:10:52.248 --> 01:10:54.785
You're making a hell of a noise!

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.247
Not thinking about the animals.

01:10:59.297 --> 01:11:02.665
This grazing land
has been used for 1000 years.

01:11:02.925 --> 01:11:04.461
You don't have the right

01:11:04.552 --> 01:11:07.169
to scare the livestock,
just for fun.

01:11:07.263 --> 01:11:08.378
Come!

01:11:08.431 --> 01:11:10.013
Nobody's having fun here.

01:11:10.099 --> 01:11:13.433
Really?
So you will herd them up

01:11:13.561 --> 01:11:17.395
when they've run back
because of your mess?

01:11:17.523 --> 01:11:19.480
We won't keep you.

01:11:19.609 --> 01:11:20.895
If you see something...

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:22.517
Over my dead body.

01:11:22.695 --> 01:11:25.904
Why would I patrol the land
they've taken from me?

01:11:26.616 --> 01:11:28.823
Get out of here!

01:12:46.612 --> 01:12:50.150
<i>The foreign national
arrested two days ago</i>

01:12:50.283 --> 01:12:51.990
<i>has been released today,</i>

01:12:52.118 --> 01:12:55.907
<i>as it's considered his
involvement was impossible.</i>

01:12:56.038 --> 01:12:58.746
<i>The police are still pursuing
the suspects...</i>

01:14:19.413 --> 01:14:20.278
Good morning.

01:14:22.083 --> 01:14:22.993
Good morning.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:26.868
Is Halla here?

01:14:28.506 --> 01:14:29.667
<i>Yes, she...</i>

01:14:30.841 --> 01:14:32.127
She is taking a shower.

01:14:32.718 --> 01:14:34.959
I understand...

01:14:35.054 --> 01:14:38.513
Would you like to...
come in and wait?

01:14:38.641 --> 01:14:42.350
No... no.
Can you give this to her?

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:47.764
It's clothes and shoes
for the little girl.

01:14:48.109 --> 01:14:49.599
I will call later.

01:14:50.194 --> 01:14:51.480
I'm Asa.

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:54.604
Her sister.

01:14:56.534 --> 01:14:57.740
Sveinbjérn.

01:15:09.588 --> 01:15:10.874
A picture of little Nika.

01:15:11.590 --> 01:15:12.671
<i>Oh, yes...</i>

01:15:13.259 --> 01:15:14.294
Nika?

01:15:14.427 --> 01:15:15.883
Yes, she's from Ukraine.

01:15:16.095 --> 01:15:17.335
She looks like you,

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:19.841
and your sister.

01:15:21.225 --> 01:15:23.136
She brought you this packet

01:15:24.270 --> 01:15:25.351
for Nika.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.774
They are hard workers,
Ukrainian men...

01:15:33.320 --> 01:15:34.481
and women.

01:16:12.359 --> 01:16:14.020
You know where to find me.

01:16:14.862 --> 01:16:16.603
You're welcome
with the little girl.

01:16:17.156 --> 01:16:18.897
She has to meet her cousin.

01:16:21.452 --> 01:16:23.944
Her alleged cousin.

01:16:25.164 --> 01:16:26.575
You are my cousin,

01:16:27.374 --> 01:16:28.864
and you will be our cousin.

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:37.358
Have a nice trip!

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:41.521
Thank you.

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:53.791
Do you know what's going on?

01:17:53.878 --> 01:17:56.620
They're taking DNA samples.

01:17:58.048 --> 01:17:59.789
The internet is on fire
about this.

01:18:31.498 --> 01:18:32.613
Have you seen this?

01:18:33.042 --> 01:18:34.248
It's incredible.

01:18:35.169 --> 01:18:38.207
You can stop searching!
She's been arrested.

01:18:38.255 --> 01:18:39.370
WhQ?

01:18:39.673 --> 01:18:42.415
The Mountain Woman.
It's some yoga teacher.

01:18:57.107 --> 01:18:58.563
She looks a bit like you.

01:19:23.550 --> 01:19:24.585
Downtown?

01:19:25.135 --> 01:19:26.125
Yes.

01:19:47.950 --> 01:19:49.782
Everything is going crazy.

01:19:50.911 --> 01:19:53.778
The terrorist they caught
is some madwoman,

01:19:53.998 --> 01:19:55.830
some bohemian artist.

01:20:00.671 --> 01:20:02.708
<i>We're looking for Halla Benediktsdéttir,</i>

01:20:02.756 --> 01:20:04.338
<i>choir conductor and musician.</i>

01:20:04.883 --> 01:20:08.547
<i>Halla is 49, 176cm tall.</i>

01:20:08.762 --> 01:20:11.129
<i>She's slim with short dark hair.</i>

01:20:11.265 --> 01:20:13.552
<i>Those who might know
her whereabouts...</i>

01:20:15.227 --> 01:20:16.467
Where are you coming from?

01:20:20.065 --> 01:20:21.146
Ukraine.

01:20:23.402 --> 01:20:25.359
I didn't know
there were flights from there.

01:20:39.209 --> 01:20:40.574
I have to throw up.

01:23:40.724 --> 01:23:42.055
Good girl!

01:24:14.841 --> 01:24:19.756
THE MOUNTAIN WOMAN WAS ALONE

01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:21.341
Well...

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:25.721
Her custody is over.
We're moving her to a cell.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:27.976
She has a visitor.

01:25:21.325 --> 01:25:23.191
You just press the button here

01:25:23.493 --> 01:25:24.574
and we'll come.

01:25:24.995 --> 01:25:26.281
You have one hour.

01:25:49.436 --> 01:25:50.392
Close the door.

01:26:01.782 --> 01:26:02.988
Thank you for the clothes.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:04.823
Are they Okay?

01:26:05.952 --> 01:26:07.113
Yes, I think.

01:26:15.003 --> 01:26:16.414
I should have told you.

01:26:16.963 --> 01:26:19.250
No, then I would have been
an accomplice.

01:26:19.800 --> 01:26:21.962
I've never been able
to keep a secret.

01:26:26.306 --> 01:26:29.799
Now I understand why you asked
me to be there for the child.

01:26:30.143 --> 01:26:31.508
I don't want to talk about it.

01:26:35.357 --> 01:26:36.563
Now you stay here

01:26:37.651 --> 01:26:40.313
and you will turn this house,
this prison,

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:44.404
into your haven,
your convent, your temple.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.613
I guess that's right.

01:26:48.704 --> 01:26:50.069
You stay here,

01:26:50.831 --> 01:26:53.198
but I, your sister Asa,

01:26:53.959 --> 01:26:55.541
I'm going to Ukraine.

01:26:56.420 --> 01:26:57.285
What?

01:26:57.337 --> 01:26:59.203
I spoke to the adoption agency.

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:03.003
I was next in line.
I've taken care of everything,

01:27:03.218 --> 01:27:04.834
I've prepared new papers,

01:27:05.011 --> 01:27:07.548
they are in a bag
in the car outside.

01:27:07.931 --> 01:27:09.717
I'm ready to go

01:27:10.350 --> 01:27:13.183
to Ukraine,
to become Nika's mother.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:15.594
But the convent and the guru?

01:27:15.689 --> 01:27:17.271
I've decided this.

01:27:18.275 --> 01:27:21.688
Your journey is now my journey.

01:27:22.529 --> 01:27:25.567
And I go straight
to the airport.

01:27:25.699 --> 01:27:27.610
- But...
- But you, Halla...

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:31.827
You will stay here
in this convent,

01:27:31.955 --> 01:27:34.993
your ashram,
and practice your meditation.

01:27:36.209 --> 01:27:37.165
Halla!

01:27:39.129 --> 01:27:40.494
You must trust me.

01:27:45.427 --> 01:27:48.340
We have a few seconds
before the camera turns on.

01:27:48.430 --> 01:27:49.716
What's going on?

01:27:51.391 --> 01:27:54.133
Our cousin just knocked out
all the power in South Iceland.

01:27:54.936 --> 01:27:55.892
Our cousin?

01:27:57.439 --> 01:27:58.600
Alleged cousin.

01:28:00.358 --> 01:28:01.723
Bring Nika home,

01:28:02.152 --> 01:28:03.642
we will help each other

01:28:03.904 --> 01:28:06.646
when I leave my convent.

01:28:08.742 --> 01:28:10.733
We end this visit
for security reasons.

01:28:47.155 --> 01:28:48.190
Namaste.

01:28:51.618 --> 01:28:52.949
What does that mean?

01:28:54.913 --> 01:28:56.870
I greet your inner,
not your outer,

01:28:56.998 --> 01:28:59.990
not your appearance,
but your inner being,

01:29:00.961 --> 01:29:02.577
who is holy and good.

01:29:03.630 --> 01:29:04.665
Namaste.

01:33:31.231 --> 01:33:32.847
My name is Nika.

01:33:38.154 --> 01:33:40.691
My name is Halla.

01:34:20.989 --> 01:34:22.070
Look“.

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:25.527
A dog.

01:34:25.660 --> 01:34:27.150
The dog.

01:35:26.262 --> 01:35:28.219
The engine is soaked,
we need to walk.
