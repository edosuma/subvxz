No penis or not penetration? -I don't know.

I mean, if you want to find the G-spot,

05:55.314 --> 05:56.940
you can't use a penis, as far as I know.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.566
-I've never -- -You've got to use fingers.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.111
To be honest, I've never found a G-spot in my fucking life.

06:01.153 --> 06:02.487
So, is it no penis or no penetration,

06:02.529 --> 06:04.072
'cause if it's no penis, you're screwed

06:04.114 --> 06:05.532
because you can penetrate with other things.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.785
You don't need a penis -- fingers, tongue.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.201
So who is that chick who got dropped off

10:18.243 --> 10:20.412
at your house two nights ago?

10:20.454 --> 10:21.996
Hmm?

10:22.038 --> 10:24.541
Um...

10:24.583 --> 10:25.792
The...

10:25.833 --> 10:27.127

10:28.669 --> 10:30.380
It'd be -- which...

10:30.422 --> 10:33.341
Dropped by around 7:00?

10:33.383 --> 10:36.761
Like, the cleaning lady, or...

10:36.803 --> 10:38.888
Why are you being so weird?

10:38.930 --> 10:41.099
Your "Lolita" act is not going over well

10:41.141 --> 10:42.683
on me or anyone else.

10:42.725 --> 10:46.605
I'm just intoxicated with my newly discovered power.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.734
I'm basically a monkey with a gun.

10:51.776 --> 10:53.320
Monkey with a gun. What is that?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.613
Is that from your shrink?

10:54.654 --> 10:57.115
So, enough about me, hmm?

10:57.157 --> 11:00.327
Who was the chick?

11:00.368 --> 11:01.995
Why do I have to tell you that?

11:02.036 --> 11:03.663
And why don't you want to?

11:03.704 --> 11:05.748
-Because -- well, there's -- -Mm-hmm.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.959
Okay, she was my -- she's my niece.

11:08.001 --> 11:11.296
There. Simple as that.

11:11.338 --> 11:14.132
-Hmm. -She's Jackie.

11:14.174 --> 11:17.636
Is everyone in your family named some derivative of Jack?

11:17.676 --> 11:20.972
Not -- no, I mean, there's -- there's several of us

11:21.014 --> 11:24.434
because I had a great-grand --

11:24.476 --> 11:25.935
We had a great-grandfather named Jack

11:25.977 --> 11:28.146
who was like pretty much most important,

11:28.188 --> 11:29.564
you know, in the family.

11:29.606 --> 11:32.066
He was very well-regarded in the community.

11:32.108 --> 11:33.985
Like a prominent -- -So.

11:34.027 --> 11:38.198
You have a niece... in her 20s.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.741
Wow.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.827
You must be old as shit.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.829
Come on. Again with the language.

11:46.581 --> 11:48.875
God.

11:48.916 --> 11:50.877
I have an older sister.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.838
She's 11 years old than me, and she --

11:50.918 --> 11:53.838
Wow.

11:53.880 --> 11:56.383
She has a daughter who's my niece.

11:56.424 --> 11:59.427
And she just transferred to Griffin, so she's

11:56.424 --> 11:59.427
new in town.

11:59.469 --> 12:01.680
So you haven't seen her, but I have 'cause she's my niece.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.515
-Mm. -And she came over.

12:03.557 --> 12:06.976
She stopped by for a visit. -For, like, an hour.

12:07.018 --> 12:09.437
I don't know how long it was. I wasn't -- I wasn't timing it.

12:09.479 --> 12:11.314
Whatever. Mm.

12:11.356 --> 12:14.108
My mom thinks you guys are weird, so...

12:14.150 --> 12:17.445
Wait, what

12:17.487 --> 12:20.532
You know, it's probably spite.

12:20.574 --> 12:22.617
Lori's big on the spite.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.246
Why would she have any spite towards me?

12:26.287 --> 12:29.332
Neighborhoods are a lot like high school.

12:29.374 --> 12:32.377
You cool kids don't hang out with her or Paul very often.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.588
You call both your parents by the first names, as well?

12:34.629 --> 12:36.381
Yeah, they totally hate it.

12:38.091 --> 12:41.802
Yeah, and your mom's now on the alumni board, right?

12:41.844 --> 12:43.388
I know.

12:43.430 --> 12:45.306
Eek, right?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.603
Eek.

12:49.644 --> 12:51.812
Let me guess. You're nervous as hell, right?

12:51.854 --> 12:53.607
I was a mess all day yesterday.

12:53.648 --> 12:56.109
We have a serious fucking Lori problem.

12:56.150 --> 12:58.069
-Yes.

12:58.111 --> 13:01.615
Ava just asked who that "chick" was at our house.

13:01.656 --> 13:04.576
Apparently both she and Lori saw Izzy get dropped off

13:04.618 --> 13:06.035
and then leave within, like, an hour,

13:06.077 --> 13:08.496
which is pretty fucking hard to explain.

13:08.538 --> 13:09.997
Ava's 16, Jack.

13:10.039 --> 13:12.083
Oh, yeah, you just keep telling yourself that, okay?

13:12.125 --> 13:14.419
Oh, God, you know, I usually tell this to my kids,

13:14.461 --> 13:16.254
but I think it applies to our situation now.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.089
And that is, you know,

13:18.131 --> 13:19.882
maybe we should get off the train tracks

13:19.924 --> 13:21.301
before the train runs us over.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.595
So, you think Ava and Lori assume

13:23.637 --> 13:25.138
a young woman visiting our house

13:25.179 --> 13:28.015
automatically means we're having a three

13:28.057 --> 13:31.185
I -- I told her she was my niece,

13:31.227 --> 13:33.521
Val's daughter.

13:33.563 --> 13:35.607
God, I hope so.

13:35.649 --> 13:37.275
By the way, Lori is pissed at us.

13:37.317 --> 13:39.694
She thinks we leave her out of stuff, apparently.

13:39.736 --> 13:41.488
Lori, who is now, you know,

13:41.529 --> 13:43.531
ON THE ALUMNI BOARD. -Babe.

13:43.573 --> 13:45.116
Babe, just take a breath.

13:45.158 --> 13:47.243
Take a breath. Breathe.

13:47.285 --> 13:49.788
I am trying, Em, but I need this.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.583
I want to be Dean of this place -- of Hamilton.

13:49.828 --> 13:53.583
Of course you do.

13:53.625 --> 13:56.210
I mean, if I get to be Dean of Hamilton,

13:53.625 --> 13:56.210
then the sky's the limit.

13:56.252 --> 13:58.672
I MEAN, I CAN BE DEAN OF GRIFFIN COLLEGE OR

14:00.881 --> 14:03.259
OKAY, OKAY. I GET IT.

Izzy can't come to the house anymore.

20:16.298 --> 20:19.343
You just dropped by our house unannounced like 36 hours ago,

20:19.385 --> 20:24.182
so I think

20:24.223 --> 20:25.808
Um...

20:25.850 --> 20:27.060
Uh, just give me a minute!

20:27.101 --> 20:29.103
Um...

20:29.145 --> 20:32.106
I'm not -- I'm not dressed.

20:32.148 --> 20:37.028
How can you not be dressed? It's, like, 12:30.

20:37.070 --> 20:38.738
I was dressed. Now I'm not.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.282
And soon I will be again. Do you have a problem with that?

20:42.324 --> 20:44.202
Why would you even bother to --

20:44.243 --> 20:45.786
You know what? Never mind.

20:45.828 --> 20:47.914
Can I -- I guess so.

20:51.876 --> 20:55.629
Sorry, the, uh, housekeeper's on vacation.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.340
Well, it's -- Let me guess.

20:58.382 --> 21:01.094
Is it three weeks of dirty laundry,

21:01.135 --> 21:02.428
some medical weed,

21:02.469 --> 21:04.764
and maybe five expired food items?

21:04.805 --> 21:07.391
Hmm. Could I offer you some espresso?

21:08.851 --> 21:10.394
I'm just fucking with you.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.105
Do you honestly think I have an espresso maker?

21:15.608 --> 21:18.069
Okay, Fred, so what are you doing here?

21:18.111 --> 21:21.739
Um, well, Emma and I have been tal--

21:21.781 --> 21:23.407
We had a discussion this morning,

21:23.449 --> 21:27.494
and it turns out we won't be requiring your services anymore.

21:27.536 --> 21:29.496
-I see. -Yeah.

21:29.538 --> 21:34.752
I mean, I think we achieved the desired results, right?

21:34.794 --> 21:36.879
We're not asking for refund or anything, so I know this --

21:36.921 --> 21:39.715
Okay, so this is where I call bullshit.

21:39.757 --> 21:41.259
Oh, really

21:41.300 --> 21:43.385
Well, first of all, you're acting super weird,

21:43.427 --> 21:46.806
and part of what you're saying is Grade-A bullshit.

21:46.847 --> 21:48.182
Which part?

21:51.102 --> 21:53.104
I don't even know what that

21:53.146 --> 21:54.897
Yeah.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.610
What are you

21:59.652 --> 22:01.112
I'm just giving Emma a quick call.

22:01.154 --> 22:03.405
No, you're not. Please. Okay, fine. It's me, okay?

22:03.447 --> 22:04.824
-It's me. Yeah. -That's what I thought.

22:04.865 --> 22:06.742
I'm the one that's canceling this. It's over.

22:06.784 --> 22:09.162
It's

22:09.203 --> 22:11.330
And please do not call my wife again.

22:11.371 --> 22:13.373
And do not answer any messages from her, okay?

22:13.415 --> 22:15.960
Oh, said the misogynistic dickface.

22:16.002 --> 22:17.336
What, we're gonna call each other names now?

22:17.377 --> 22:19.130
Is that what's happening

22:19.172 --> 22:22.300
I'm going to consider this evening's appointment canceled,

22:22.341 --> 22:24.218
and whatever the rest of us consenting adults

22:24.260 --> 22:26.428
choose to do is entirely up to us.

22:26.470 --> 22:28.097
I'm the only one being an adult here.

22:28.139 --> 22:29.932
You're the only adult

22:29.974 --> 22:31.391
-Yeah. -Okay.

22:31.433 --> 22:33.727
So I'm gonna ask you a question, Jack.

22:33.769 --> 22:37.023
How long after we terminate the agreement

22:37.064 --> 22:39.733
before you call me on your own, hmm?

22:39.775 --> 22:42.069
Not going to.

22:42.111 --> 22:43.654
Want to make a bet?

22:43.696 --> 22:45.363
Mm-hmm.

22:45.405 --> 22:46.824
I say two weeks, max.

22:46.866 --> 22:48.201
Sure.

22:52.246 --> 22:53.706
Don't do that.

22:56.000 --> 22:58.961
You think you're irresistible?

22:59.003 --> 23:00.754
Don't you?

23:00.796 --> 23:02.256
Oh, you don't think about me? -Okay.

23:02.298 --> 23:03.841
