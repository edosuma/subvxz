00:34.368 --> 00:37.412
Uh, Teacher Squawk,
we finished our group project.

00:37.496 --> 00:39.081
Do we pass?

00:39.164 --> 00:41.083
[gasping]

00:43.919 --> 00:47.256
I shall call you Meatcher Squawk.

00:49.466 --> 00:52.052
You gorgeous meat man, you.

00:52.135 --> 00:55.180
Teacher, can we eat Meat Teacher now?

00:55.264 --> 00:56.390
[growls]

00:56.473 --> 00:58.600
Students, building this statue

00:58.684 --> 01:01.687
wasn't just a well-deserved
tribute to me.

01:01.770 --> 01:07.568
It was also a lesson in teamwork,
which all cavemen need to survive

01:07.651 --> 01:09.987
until there's a food shortage.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.613
Then it's every man for himself.

01:11.697 --> 01:16.285
So to teach that lesson,
we're going to play Ahhh! Smashin'.

01:16.368 --> 01:20.622
Oh, is that the game where we smash food
in our mouths and go, "Ahhh!"?

01:20.706 --> 01:22.124
No. [laughs]

01:22.207 --> 01:26.837
Ahhh! Smashin' is 15 students,
no rules.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.047
If you're hit with a smash fruit,
you're out.

01:29.131 --> 01:34.636
- Last student standing, wins.
- Teacher, actually, there's 16 of us.

01:35.846 --> 01:38.598
Fifteen students left.

01:38.682 --> 01:41.435
Teacher Squawk,
we're not gonna fight each other

01:41.518 --> 01:44.187
- just 'cause you tell us to.
- Hmm.

01:44.271 --> 01:46.148
Winner gets the meatcher.

01:48.775 --> 01:49.775
[all shouting]

01:49.818 --> 01:52.237
Let the smashing begin!

01:53.530 --> 01:56.617
Well, these nails won't chew themselves.

01:58.201 --> 01:59.036
[panting]

01:59.119 --> 02:01.288
Hey, Eep, wanna team up?

02:01.371 --> 02:02.289
Hmm.

02:02.372 --> 02:06.627
Instead of smash fruits,
let's hit each other with hugs.

02:07.628 --> 02:10.130
Like... [laughs]

02:10.213 --> 02:12.758
We could call ourselves Team Croods.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.676
Or, or, or, we can go with a name

02:14.760 --> 02:17.179
that will strike fear into the hearts
of our enemies, like...

02:17.262 --> 02:21.016
- Team Fart Monster.
- I don't think so, Thunk.

02:21.099 --> 02:24.269
I have a shot at winning, and...
You're about to knock yourself out.

02:24.353 --> 02:27.022
But I didn't,
because we make such a great team.

02:27.105 --> 02:29.858
Go, Team Fart... [grunts]

02:29.941 --> 02:31.818
[Munk] Hooray.

02:31.902 --> 02:33.945
Is what my stomach is saying right now

02:34.029 --> 02:36.698
because that meat was perfect,
prepared just the way I like it.

02:36.782 --> 02:39.242
Yeah, I was going for a medium dead.

02:39.326 --> 02:42.120
Whoops. Looks like that one
was a little under-killed.

02:42.204 --> 02:46.124
Gotta say, this has been a great...
Uh, what do you call this thing again?

02:46.208 --> 02:47.209
[both] A visit.

02:47.292 --> 02:50.629
Well, you can have me over
for a visit anytime, all the time.

02:50.712 --> 02:52.506
[laughs]

02:52.589 --> 02:55.133
[laughs nervously]

02:55.217 --> 02:58.387
Yeah, uh, well,
we'll have to do this again,

02:58.470 --> 03:00.472
on a different day than today.

03:00.555 --> 03:03.016
Well, I look forward to that.

03:03.100 --> 03:04.476
[humming]

03:05.977 --> 03:08.021
Why won't he leave?

03:08.105 --> 03:10.565
I mean, is there some part
of the visit we forgot?

03:10.649 --> 03:13.860
No, we gave him a tour, fed him lunch,
made small talk, laughed politely.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.445
He really should go now.

03:15.529 --> 03:18.407
Maybe if we're silent,
he'll get bored and take the hint.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.660
Did you just have your place re-dirted?

03:23.912 --> 03:27.124
Ooh, cakey.
Now is every part of the floor like this?

03:34.548 --> 03:37.217
- Hey.
- Hi, Kevin.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.513
Wait, you're not gonna smash me,
are you?

03:42.639 --> 03:46.518
Nah. Now just keep being distracted
by my dreaminess.

03:46.601 --> 03:50.397
Ah. Okay. Wait, what?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.565
Ah!

03:51.648 --> 03:52.774
You blew it.

03:52.858 --> 03:55.944
I should've known you were just,
like, a pretty, like, face.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.028
Thanks.

03:58.447 --> 04:01.700
Oh! Oh, no, my pretty face!

04:04.619 --> 04:07.330
That was close, Eep.
You need a new plan.

04:07.414 --> 04:11.168
Like stop calling attention to yourself
by thinking out loud. Huh?

04:11.251 --> 04:13.086
[Thunk] Hmm.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.755
Ah!

04:14.838 --> 04:16.005

04:17.423 --> 04:19.259
[Eep] Leave my little brother alone!

04:21.887 --> 04:23.930
Nice, Eep.
I told you we make a great team.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.224
Uh, no, no. I was just protecting you

04:26.308 --> 04:28.351
'cause I'm your big sister and you were...

04:28.435 --> 04:31.271
Making fruit traps.
They're dangerous and delicious.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.732
They're delangericious. Look.

04:34.691 --> 04:38.570
When you stick your butt up in the air
like that, you draw everyone else...

You know, you're right, Thunk.
We should work together.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.178
Great and I'll assume that weird smile

05:03.261 --> 05:06.640
is because you're excited to be on
Team Fart Monster.

05:07.641 --> 05:09.518
We can't run from what we are, Eep.

Grug, is this your tooth-sharpening stick?
I always wanted to try one.

05:48.682 --> 05:51.226
No, it's mine.

05:51.309 --> 05:53.144
Let me throw him out of the cave.
Please?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.313
I know I can throw him really far.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.525
- No, that would be rude.
- I'm okay with that.

05:58.608 --> 06:01.695
But Munk is my friend,
and friends do not do that.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.619
Unless your whole friendship is based on
one person throwing the other,

06:04.656 --> 06:05.782

Yep, but... [chuckles]
Pat's still out there,

06:49.743 --> 06:53.204
so we're gonna need
a special trap to get her.

06:53.288 --> 06:57.042
Maybe you can make one out in the open.

06:57.125 --> 06:58.543

That wasn't Team Fart Monster's logo,
was it?

All right, Thunk,
you don't have to be bait anymore.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.375
I'll just take you out now.

07:38.458 --> 07:42.045
Don't underestimate me, Eep.

- They just will not go.

Yeah, the door is six Gunks wide.

Our tree will fit in here.

08:31.761 --> 08:35.015
Should we move it in now, or will we be
joining your sleep pile tonight?

That is it.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.987
Oh, it's like picking
between the children!

12:18.071 --> 12:19.364
Mare the Zapper.

12:19.447 --> 12:22.825
She rubbed fuzzy objects
and then zapped people.

12:22.909 --> 12:24.702
- [sizzles]
- Oh, come on. No one can...

12:24.786 --> 12:25.703
- [zaps]
- Ouch!

12:25.787 --> 12:29.999
[gasps] So this is what
power feels like.

12:30.083 --> 12:31.459
[sizzles, zaps]

12:31.542 --> 12:33.378
Ow! Power hurts.

12:33.461 --> 12:34.461
[both sizzle]

12:34.504 --> 12:36.923
[both] Ow! Ow!

12:38.299 --> 12:39.300
Hush.

12:39.384 --> 12:43.304
Friends, neighbors,
half-wits I can barely stand.

12:43.388 --> 12:44.889
Hello.

12:44.973 --> 12:47.392
As head of the Wall of Fame
selection team,

12:47.475 --> 12:50.311
I'm proud to announce
our newest honoree.

12:50.395 --> 12:52.397
This is it, Grug, your moment.

12:53.523 --> 12:54.732
Baitsy!

12:55.733 --> 12:59.237
Tell everyone the amazing discovery
that earned you this recognition.

12:59.320 --> 13:03.908
Well, I learned that when you rub
two sticks together really hard,

13:03.992 --> 13:06.744
it makes smoke and nothing else.

13:06.828 --> 13:08.830
Wow, that's fascinating. So fascinating.

13:08.913 --> 13:10.748
[all cheer]

13:10.832 --> 13:13.334
Are you kidding me?!

13:14.085 --> 13:16.713
I mean, no offense
to Baitsy's dumb smoke idea,

13:16.796 --> 13:19.590
but that should be my face
getting stamped onto the wall.

13:23.136 --> 13:27.056
The only reason I didn't get chosen
is that you don't like me, Snoot.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.350
Oh, please. You think I like Baitsy?

13:29.434 --> 13:31.519
What did you do that's wall-worthy?

13:31.602 --> 13:35.398
- Uh, I cleaned up the whole town.
- Which started a monkhuahua attack.

13:35.481 --> 13:39.068
Yeah, but I also stopped the Broods
on three separate occasions.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.737
And you led them here on four.

13:40.820 --> 13:43.740
Face it, Grug,
you're not Wall of Fame material.

13:43.823 --> 13:46.451
Now, the Wall of Bad Smells,
on the other hand. [chuckles]

13:48.453 --> 13:49.704
[all laugh]

13:49.787 --> 13:51.039
[exclaims]

13:51.831 --> 13:54.959
For your information,
Grug doesn't smell bad.

13:55.043 --> 13:56.794
He smells weird.

13:56.878 --> 13:58.046
[Grug grunts]

13:58.129 --> 14:01.507
Who cares what some wall thinks of you?
Walls are jerks anyway,

14:01.591 --> 14:03.271
always hurting you
when you bump into them.

14:03.342 --> 14:08.681
If I'm not on that wall,
I won't be remembered forever.

14:08.765 --> 14:11.059
Sure, you will. You got your kids.

14:11.142 --> 14:13.519
[Eep and Thunk zap, scream]

14:14.562 --> 14:17.607
Or you've got your best friend.
I'll always be by your side.

14:17.690 --> 14:20.068
Thanks, Munk,
but can you be on my other side?

14:20.151 --> 14:22.362
I wanna work that part of the trunk.

14:23.654 --> 14:25.656
Grug, buddy, you gotta relax.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.658
You know what I do to calm down? Okay.

14:27.742 --> 14:29.243
Feet shoulder width.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.330
Relax your knees.
Hands in a death-like grip.

14:32.413 --> 14:35.958
Yeah, not feeling as angry,
but I am feeling uncomfortable.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.877
Good. Uncomfortable is good.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.380
Okay, now, hit that rock.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.134
[grunting]

14:48.221 --> 14:49.097
Whoa.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.557
That was oddly satisfying.

14:55.645 --> 14:58.523
That was even more satisfying.

14:58.606 --> 15:02.652
I just got an idea.
A Wall of Fame-worthy idea.

15:03.653 --> 15:07.156
It is called grunk,
a new game where grown cavemen

15:07.240 --> 15:09.784
take out their frustration
on a tiny object.

15:11.077 --> 15:12.787
And try to sink it in a hole.

15:16.082 --> 15:17.792
Hmm. You missed.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.586
[laughs] Not that hole. That one.

15:20.670 --> 15:23.047
Ahhh. [gulps]

15:23.131 --> 15:26.467
[coughs, chokes]

15:26.551 --> 15:27.427
Hey!

15:27.510 --> 15:29.720
Actually,
holes in the ground would work better.

15:29.804 --> 15:33.266
And then you keep walking around
until you've done 18 holes.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.852
- Hey, where are you going?
- Give it up, Grug.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.020
If I want a long walk
that ends in frustration,

15:38.104 --> 15:39.605
I can go to the tar pits.

15:39.689 --> 15:42.191
Oh, come on, Snoot.
Other people like it.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.317
[shouts]

15:43.401 --> 15:45.736
- Take that, tiny object!
- [shouts]

15:45.820 --> 15:47.989
Fine. Take me around.

15:48.072 --> 15:50.992
But you've only got one "around"
to prove you belong on the wall.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.619
- One.
- [Eep and Thunk scream]

15:59.250 --> 16:01.794
[Snoot] Clearly, you haven't thought
this through, Grug.

16:01.878 --> 16:04.630
There are obstacles
between you and that hole.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.175
Ah. But that is the best part, Snoot.

16:17.059 --> 16:18.227
Ooh!

16:18.311 --> 16:19.729
See. Fun, right?

16:28.863 --> 16:31.449
Yes, all part of the joy of grunk.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.702
[growls]

16:35.703 --> 16:39.415
Wait! I've been saving this, but what if
each player gets a cave child

16:39.499 --> 16:42.793
that follows them all day
to boss around however they want?

16:42.877 --> 16:44.128
My name's Caddy.

16:44.212 --> 16:48.257
Well, Caddy, this club is all wrong.
Bring me a new one.

16:48.341 --> 16:50.885
- Yes, sir.
- And a fancy hat.

16:50.968 --> 16:52.178
- And a smash fruit.
- Sorry.

16:53.179 --> 16:54.931
- To throw in your face.
- Okay.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.603
- [all chatter]
- Amber hope for...

17:00.686 --> 17:03.606
Caddy, my shot and I require quiet!

17:03.689 --> 17:05.441
Shh!

17:07.693 --> 17:09.694
- [all exclaim]
- Shh!

17:12.823 --> 17:14.659
[Munk] Holy smoke!

17:14.742 --> 17:17.411
Well, there's just no other way
to say this.

17:17.494 --> 17:20.164
Your dumb brains
didn't make something I hate.

17:20.248 --> 17:21.915
[gasps] You mean...?

17:21.999 --> 17:25.795
The game of grunk deserves
this season's spot on the wall.

17:27.128 --> 17:28.130
Sorry, Baitsy.

17:28.214 --> 17:29.882
[sobs]

17:31.384 --> 17:33.678
So which one of you
will be remembered forever

17:33.761 --> 17:36.222
and which one of you
will be forgotten immediately?

17:37.223 --> 17:39.100
There's only room for one face.

17:39.183 --> 17:41.310
Then no, thank you.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.646
Best friends stick together, right, Grug?

17:44.897 --> 17:47.984
I prefer this side,
but hey, I trust the artist. What, Munk?

17:48.067 --> 17:50.403
Huh? [whimpers]
What?

17:50.486 --> 17:52.363
[zapping]

17:52.446 --> 17:53.864
[screams, groans]

17:53.948 --> 17:56.450
Ow! You shocked my eye that time.

17:56.534 --> 17:57.910
Nyah, nyah, nyah!

17:57.994 --> 17:59.579
[screams]

18:00.162 --> 18:02.540
[screaming continues]

18:02.623 --> 18:03.623
[sizzling]

18:03.666 --> 18:05.501
[shouts angrily]

18:05.585 --> 18:08.004
[screams]

18:09.839 --> 18:12.425
[distorted screams]

18:17.722 --> 18:18.722
Huh?

18:19.724 --> 18:22.184
[gasps, growls]

18:22.268 --> 18:23.436
Huh?

18:24.854 --> 18:27.189
[screams]

18:33.904 --> 18:34.904
[screams]

18:36.907 --> 18:38.242
[screams]

18:45.583 --> 18:47.001
What are you doing, Grug?

18:47.084 --> 18:50.129
We made grunk together, as friends.

18:50.212 --> 18:53.674
Sure, you were there,
but to cheer on my shots,

18:53.758 --> 18:56.385
and since I'm better at it,
I clearly invented it.

18:56.469 --> 18:59.055
What? I showed you
how to hit a rock with a club,

18:59.138 --> 19:00.514
that's pretty much the whole idea.

19:00.598 --> 19:05.019
That's not the whole idea,
because the idea of a hole was all mine,

19:05.102 --> 19:08.689
as was the obstacles, the walking,
the spikes for better traction.

19:08.773 --> 19:13.319
So say it with me, Munk.
Grug made grunk. Grug made grunk.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.946
Munk made grunk. Munk made grunk.

19:16.030 --> 19:18.574
[coughs, clears throat]

19:18.658 --> 19:22.870
There's only one mature way
to settle this. A game.

19:22.953 --> 19:24.580
You two play one around of grunk,

19:24.664 --> 19:26.499
and the winner
gets the spot on the wall.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.626
- Deal.
- Deal.

19:35.549 --> 19:37.134
[squeals]

19:39.387 --> 19:40.388
[Grug] Ooh, a birdie.

19:40.471 --> 19:44.100
Now that's a shot only the true inventor
of grunk could make.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.477
[grumbles]

19:54.068 --> 19:55.361
[grumbles]

19:59.949 --> 20:01.701
[panting]

20:03.953 --> 20:05.246
[howls]

20:05.329 --> 20:07.540
[laughs] Nice backswing.

20:09.750 --> 20:11.502
- Huh?
- [Grug gasps]

20:13.838 --> 20:14.755
[all scream]

20:14.839 --> 20:18.843
[Grug] Okay, okay,
this is out of hand, Munk.

20:18.926 --> 20:22.847
Just give up so we can get on
with not being stung to death.

20:22.930 --> 20:23.973
Never.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.518
[all continue screaming]

20:27.601 --> 20:30.187
[all screaming]

20:44.744 --> 20:46.162
[Gran] Hey!

20:46.245 --> 20:48.247
Pipe down, you bozos.

20:48.330 --> 20:52.418
I'm trying to get my beauty sleep.
You think this just happens?

20:54.462 --> 20:56.172
[all] Sorry, Gran.

20:58.340 --> 21:00.509
[both whisper] Sorry.

21:00.593 --> 21:02.428
[both mutter]

21:06.140 --> 21:08.225
- [explosion]
- [all scream]

21:09.727 --> 21:13.189
[speaks softly] It all comes down
to this. Last hole, tie game.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.398
Not for long.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.442
[Munk grunts]

21:16.525 --> 21:18.402
[grumbles, grinds teeth]

21:19.320 --> 21:21.280
Munk, could you grind your teeth
somewhere else?

21:21.363 --> 21:23.866
- Trying to beat you here, buddy.
- I'm not your buddy, Grug.

21:23.949 --> 21:26.827
Sure, not while we're playing,
but we'll go out for smash fruit later.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.288
No, we stopped being buddies

21:29.371 --> 21:33.667
when you chose a space on the wall
over a space in my heart. [sobs]

21:33.751 --> 21:37.755
But wait. We're...
We're really not friends?

21:37.838 --> 21:39.673
[sobbing]

21:49.183 --> 21:50.601
[all gasp]

21:50.684 --> 21:52.019
Then you win, Munk.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.772
I'd rather lose the Wall of Fame
than lose a friend.

21:54.855 --> 21:56.690
But I do wish I could have both.

21:56.774 --> 21:59.860
[gasps] You can.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.698
No. I'm the one who's losing.

22:04.782 --> 22:08.619
- No. Me.
- Oh, yeah? Well...

22:08.702 --> 22:13.749
- Wait, what are we doing?
- I don't even know anymore.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.876
[mutters]

22:15.960 --> 22:19.255
Wow, you've chosen friendship
over glory.

22:19.338 --> 22:22.007
But the inventor of friendship
is already on the wall,

22:22.091 --> 22:24.051
so neither one of you ever will be.

22:24.134 --> 22:26.762
And this wall is forever.

22:26.845 --> 22:28.013
[screaming]

22:30.057 --> 22:32.059
[crumbling]

22:32.142 --> 22:33.894
- [all grunt]
- [gasps]

22:33.978 --> 22:37.815
Hey, look, Eep. [chuckles]
We made the wall.

22:37.898 --> 22:40.484
[all laugh]

22:41.986 --> 22:43.279
[music playing]
