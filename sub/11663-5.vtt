(mellow music playing)

01:07.400 --> 01:09.166
Dorothy, it's past your bedtime.

01:09.233 --> 01:13.033
I'm 60. I can stay up
as late as I want.

01:13.667 --> 01:16.467
No. When you're 65,
you can stay up as late as you want.

01:18.266 --> 01:21.867
-What are you doing?
-I'm writing a letter to pop.

01:21.934 --> 01:24.734
-The same pop who died 17 years ago?
-That's right.

01:24.800 --> 01:27.600
Nothing's sadder than your daughter
losing it before you do.

01:28.633 --> 01:31.100
I'm not mailing it.

01:31.166 --> 01:34.367
I just read somewhere that you can settle
your feelings about someone

01:34.433 --> 01:35.834
even after they're gone.

01:36.333 --> 01:41.100
There were lots of things I never
told pop. I never got to say goodbye.

01:41.166 --> 01:44.767
So I'm getting all this stored-up
emotion out.

01:44.834 --> 01:47.500
Good idea, pussycat.
I'll write one to Mario Lanza.

01:49.600 --> 01:54.433
Oh. I would like you all to meet Stevie.
I'll be coaching him.

01:54.500 --> 01:56.633
He's a professional baseball player.

01:56.700 --> 02:00.467
Oh. You got Blanche's number
from the wall in the dugout?

02:02.033 --> 02:05.667
Yes, ma'am, and it sure was right.
I am having a good time.

02:08.333 --> 02:11.266
Well, thank you, Stevie.
Now, here's the vitamins.

02:11.333 --> 02:12.600
Take them when you get up.

02:12.667 --> 02:15.633
But sometimes I get up at 4am to...
you know.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.567
I know. Boy, do I know.

02:19.033 --> 02:21.500
Yeah, but I'm sure afterwards
Stevie doesn't yell,

02:21.567 --> 02:23.667
"Help, come get me. My feet are asleep."

02:26.000 --> 02:30.934
Get to bed, darling. You're in training.
Oh. Wait a minute. Almost forgot.

02:31.000 --> 02:35.233
Put this lingerie on under your uniform
for batting practice.

02:38.834 --> 02:42.100
I know you said you'd help my game,
but you think this will work?

02:42.166 --> 02:43.400
Yes.

02:44.100 --> 02:45.467
I can't wear this. Do you have any idea

02:45.533 --> 02:47.800
the kind of teasing that
goes on in a locker room?

02:47.867 --> 02:49.367
Yes.

02:51.700 --> 02:55.700
Now, look, you have to discover
the sensuality of baseball.

02:55.967 --> 02:58.200
There are just many, many,
many similarities

02:58.266 --> 03:00.900
between baseball and making love.

03:02.633 --> 03:06.834
The mental preparation,
the rush of adrenaline...

03:07.133 --> 03:09.734
the unspecified duration of the game.

03:11.333 --> 03:14.834
And you should hear the cheers coming
from Blanche's room on old-timer's day.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.867
It was nice meeting you. See you tomorrow.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.333
Bye.

03:22.233 --> 03:23.734
Now, wait a minute.

03:24.133 --> 03:27.333
You're coaching a baseball player
by letting him wear your underwear?

03:27.400 --> 03:28.934
Didn't I see this movie?

03:29.333 --> 03:32.700
A woman helps a handsome ballplayer,
and he goes off to live with the Indians.

03:33.133 --> 03:34.533
What was it called?

03:36.266 --> 03:38.100
-Dances with bulls?
-No.

03:39.734 --> 03:43.967
Ma, you're confusing <i>Bull Durham</i>
with <i>Dances With Wolves.</i>

03:44.967 --> 03:46.700
Ah, what's the difference?

03:46.767 --> 03:49.100
You get to see Kevin Costner's buns
in both of them.

03:52.200 --> 03:55.500
Well, maybe I can't teach Stevie
anything about the game,

03:55.567 --> 03:58.867
but I can encourage him
and give him a shot of self-esteem.

03:59.266 --> 04:02.700
Some people are great artists,
some great musicians.

04:02.767 --> 04:05.900
-I have but one talent.
-Ooh! Ooh! I know.

04:05.967 --> 04:09.367
-Come on, Ma. Too easy.
-That's what I was going to say.

04:12.100 --> 04:16.400
My talent is molding men.
I'm not doing this just for myself.

04:16.467 --> 04:19.000
I'm doing it for baseball, for the fans.

04:19.066 --> 04:22.600
-The community expects something of me.
-Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I know.

04:23.934 --> 04:26.100
(calm music playing)

04:26.166 --> 04:31.066
Thanks for a wonderful evening.
Not many men would take a girl shopping.

04:31.133 --> 04:33.967
Well, not every woman
likes to shop for bait.

04:36.567 --> 04:40.400
Well, sweetheart, I had a wonderful time.
Good night.

04:40.467 --> 04:43.333
Oh, wait. What's this in my pocket?

04:43.400 --> 04:47.700
That line didn't work last night,
and it's not going to work tonight.

04:51.467 --> 04:52.500
Ta-da.

04:53.166 --> 04:54.400
Come on. Put it on.

04:55.133 --> 04:56.133
Oh.

04:56.433 --> 04:58.633
It's beautiful.

04:59.166 --> 05:00.800
The stone goes on top, Rose.

05:01.333 --> 05:03.300
Oh, it is beautiful.

05:05.166 --> 05:08.834
Before I wear this,
I have to know what it means.

05:08.900 --> 05:12.166
It's a friendship ring,
like Abbott might have given to Costello.

05:12.233 --> 05:13.600
I love it.

05:14.266 --> 05:15.567
So now we're...

05:16.233 --> 05:18.433
a dead comedy team?

05:20.166 --> 05:22.200
It's that sense of humor.

05:22.867 --> 05:25.133
That's why I buy you jewelry.

05:28.066 --> 05:30.834
Good night... good buddy.

05:33.066 --> 05:37.166
No, no, Rose,
it's more than just a friendship ring.

05:37.233 --> 05:41.066
It's just that I want my ring on my girl.

05:42.166 --> 05:44.300
Are you saying what I think you're saying?

05:44.734 --> 05:46.066
What do you think I'm saying?

05:47.033 --> 05:49.000
Well, I think you're saying...

05:50.200 --> 05:53.967
you want your ring on your girl.

05:57.033 --> 05:58.166
Yes.

06:00.467 --> 06:04.800
(serene music playing)

06:06.934 --> 06:08.133
Hi, everyone.

06:08.433 --> 06:10.500
If I seem a little giddy, it's because...

06:11.000 --> 06:12.667
look what Miles gave me.

06:13.967 --> 06:15.200
Liver spots?

06:23.100 --> 06:24.367
No. The ring.

06:24.834 --> 06:26.166
You know what it is?

06:26.767 --> 06:30.867
Well, it's not an engagement ring,
but it's more than a friendship ring.

06:30.934 --> 06:33.066
It's a... it's a...

06:33.633 --> 06:34.834
Isn't it pretty?

06:36.867 --> 06:39.533
Much nicer than Abbott
would have given to Costello.

06:41.467 --> 06:42.600
Aah!

06:43.900 --> 06:47.100
Rose, the light bulb goes on every time.

06:49.934 --> 06:52.066
Doesn't mean someone's living there.

06:52.667 --> 06:56.133
It's Charlie.

06:56.200 --> 06:58.633
He's trying to contact me
from beyond the grave.

06:58.700 --> 06:59.834
It's a miracle.

07:01.066 --> 07:04.000
Look closely, Rose. It's Mrs. Butterworth.

07:08.767 --> 07:10.166
You better sit down.

07:10.667 --> 07:12.100
Before he died...

07:12.166 --> 07:15.600
Charlie and I agreed that if he ever
wanted to tell me something

07:15.667 --> 07:17.900
from the other side, we'd have a signal.

07:19.133 --> 07:22.967
All the cantaloupe would be on one side
of the fruit salad.

07:28.767 --> 07:31.633
See, Charlie liked to eat
each type of fruit separately.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.767
He hated it when they were
all mixed together.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.800
Then why did you make fruit salad?

07:36.400 --> 07:39.867
That was an argument we must have had
about a million times.

07:41.200 --> 07:42.934
But he hated cantaloupe.

07:43.000 --> 07:45.667
He said he'd rather be dead
than eat cantaloupe.

07:45.734 --> 07:47.266
Hence the signal.

07:48.700 --> 07:50.367
Dorothy, it's a miracle.

07:51.100 --> 07:53.567
But why would he try
to contact me now?

07:54.000 --> 07:57.233
Oh, my God.
It's the ring that Miles gave me.

07:57.967 --> 08:00.967
Charlie doesn't want me belonging
to another man.

08:02.266 --> 08:06.133
Blanche, just out of curiosity,
check the fruit salad.

08:06.200 --> 08:07.333
No way.

08:12.100 --> 08:14.467
I'm not going anywhere near
that refrigerator.

08:15.166 --> 08:17.100
Wow. Two miracles in one day.

08:19.400 --> 08:24.400
(mellow music playing)

08:25.767 --> 08:30.600
I'm sorry, girls. I couldn't get to sleep.
I just had to see it once more.

08:32.066 --> 08:33.500
Where's my cantaloupe?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.500
Where's my miracle?

08:42.533 --> 08:44.367
I'm an old lady, I need fruit.

08:46.200 --> 08:49.667
Girls, what a great night.
Stevie went 3 for 4.

08:49.734 --> 08:52.533
-Oh, you were at the game.
-There was a game?

08:55.700 --> 08:58.900
Oh. That man just makes me
feel so young,

08:58.967 --> 09:00.767
like I was back in high school again.

09:00.834 --> 09:03.367
Remember how you used to feel

09:03.433 --> 09:06.233
when your boyfriend was star of
the football team?

09:06.533 --> 09:08.700
Oh. Look who I'm talking to.

09:14.333 --> 09:17.300
My Dorothy knew the star of the football
team very well.

09:17.367 --> 09:19.433
In fact, she was the head cheerleader.

09:19.500 --> 09:22.300
Head cheerleader. Listen to me.
She was the mascot.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.600
Put her in a bear suit with pompoms.

09:27.133 --> 09:28.500
Do the growl, pussycat.

09:29.133 --> 09:30.333
Do the growl.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.967
-Oh, Ma.
-That's it. That's it.

09:34.266 --> 09:36.567
No, it so happens I was their good-luck
charm.

09:36.633 --> 09:39.100
They won a lot of games
with me in that suit.

09:39.166 --> 09:42.166
Sure, the other team was always afraid
we'd send in the bear.

09:44.166 --> 09:46.834
-God, you gave me a lot of laughs.
-Ma.

09:46.900 --> 09:49.333
That's it. Oh, stop it.

09:50.734 --> 09:54.934
Then you know what I mean
about being around athletes. It's fun.

09:55.000 --> 10:00.000
And you know what they call them.
Jocks. Isn't that simply delicious?

10:01.100 --> 10:05.934
Blanche, this isn't going to work.
You don't know anything about baseball.

10:06.000 --> 10:07.934
You're just misleading this guy.

10:08.000 --> 10:11.066
Oh, you're just jealous
because I have a healthy sex life,

10:11.133 --> 10:13.266
and all you have is your mother.

10:15.533 --> 10:19.133
Dorothy would rather have me
than a healthy sex life.

10:19.200 --> 10:21.033
Right... not!

10:23.700 --> 10:24.867
That's how you talk to your mother?

10:24.934 --> 10:28.000
Tell your father how sassy you've gotten
since menopause.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.533
You haven't mailed that letter
to your father yet?

10:36.600 --> 10:39.233
Once more, I'm not mailing it.

10:39.300 --> 10:42.500
I'm just writing this
to get the anger out of my system.

10:42.567 --> 10:44.200
I know pop loved me,

10:44.266 --> 10:47.500
but he always made promises
that he never kept.

10:47.567 --> 10:49.700
Do you know how that
affects a little girl?

10:49.767 --> 10:56.734
He promised me he'd take me to his work,
introduce me to his boss and his friends.

10:57.667 --> 11:01.266
When he didn't, I felt like there was
something wrong with me,

11:01.333 --> 11:05.734
-like he wasn't proud of me.
-He was proud of you.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.000
I remember him saying,
"Anyone would want a daughter like this."

11:09.667 --> 11:11.967
Of course he was saying it to the gypsies.

11:17.000 --> 11:18.667
I don't have to listen to this.

11:18.734 --> 11:22.133
Have you any idea how that makes me feel
when you say things like that?

11:22.567 --> 11:24.834
No. After I'm dead, drop me a note.

11:30.834 --> 11:35.767
Boy, Charlie must really be upset
about me accepting Miles' ring.

11:36.266 --> 11:39.200
If I could just talk to him
one more time...

11:40.367 --> 11:43.934
I would give every last cent I have.

11:46.600 --> 11:48.533
Wait, Rose.

11:50.867 --> 11:52.166
What, Sophia?

11:52.233 --> 11:54.533
It's not Sophia. It's Charlie.

11:54.834 --> 11:56.633
I'm in the old lady's body.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.333
Come on, Sophia. You're full of...

12:00.300 --> 12:01.800
fruit salad.

12:04.834 --> 12:06.100
Charlie?

12:07.700 --> 12:10.333
Charlie, I want to believe it's you.

12:11.567 --> 12:14.400
Tell me something that only the two
of us would know.

12:15.166 --> 12:17.233
Don't take any wooden nickels.

12:18.333 --> 12:20.934
Oh, my God. It is you.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.800
Why have you come back now?

12:25.867 --> 12:28.467
To tell you to open your heart
and your pocketbook.

12:28.533 --> 12:30.133
Give the old lady money.

12:31.000 --> 12:32.233
Make it a 20.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.500
I will, but there's something
I have to know.

12:36.166 --> 12:38.734
How do you feel about the ring
Miles gave me?

12:39.700 --> 12:41.367
How do you think I feel?

12:41.433 --> 12:44.700
You must be pretty upset to come back.

12:44.767 --> 12:46.233
Okay, that works.

12:46.767 --> 12:47.767
Uh...

12:48.433 --> 12:51.567
-I have to go, Rose.
-Goodbye, my love.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.100
What happened?

12:56.633 --> 12:59.467
Why am I standing?
When can I get that 20?

13:01.400 --> 13:06.066
Sophia, the most amazing thing happened.
Charlie was here.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.567
In your body.

13:07.633 --> 13:11.500
Really? If I had known he was coming,
I would have tidied up a bit.

13:24.867 --> 13:27.400
Miles? It's me.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.834
Miles, this isn't easy. I, uh...

13:32.400 --> 13:33.867
I've come to a decision.

13:35.033 --> 13:36.633
I can't keep the ring.

13:39.333 --> 13:43.533
(serene music playing)

13:45.333 --> 13:48.000
Rose, Miles called earlier.

13:48.066 --> 13:51.533
He must have gotten the ring.
I sent it back.

13:51.600 --> 13:55.767
Honey, what happened?
You were so happy about him yesterday.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.734
-That was before I talked to Charlie.
-What do you mean?

13:59.800 --> 14:02.967
I heard Charlie's voice coming out
of Sophia.

14:05.467 --> 14:07.667
He wanted me to give the ring back.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.300
You're a horrible little person.

14:19.500 --> 14:22.834
Come on. Like you never pretended
to be possessed by somebody's dead husband

14:22.900 --> 14:24.200
for a couple of laughs.

14:25.233 --> 14:29.266
You know, you have really ruined
Rose's relationship with Miles.

14:29.333 --> 14:32.934
If you could have seen her face
when I talked like Charlie.

14:33.000 --> 14:34.834
I almost wet myself.

14:37.600 --> 14:40.600
Listen, you vindictive little sea monkey.

14:42.567 --> 14:46.233
-You are going to tell Rose the truth.
-Or?

14:46.300 --> 14:48.066
Remember shady pines?

14:49.133 --> 14:53.200
-Yeah. It wasn't so bad.
-They sold it to some Germans.

14:53.266 --> 14:54.633
Rose.

14:55.333 --> 14:57.934
Rose, sweetheart. Rose. Rose.

14:59.200 --> 15:03.033
(calm music playing)

15:07.467 --> 15:10.533
Whoo! You're getting better all the time.

15:11.266 --> 15:13.967
Ooh! With those two hits
in last night's game,

15:14.033 --> 15:16.333
your batting average
is up over .300 now.

15:16.400 --> 15:21.333
Yeah, but on that last swing,
I think I tore my camisole.

15:22.567 --> 15:26.400
Well, let's head for the showers.
You wash and I'll dry.

15:27.100 --> 15:29.734
That might be a problem.
I got to tell you something.

15:29.800 --> 15:32.333
But first, you've changed my life.

15:32.400 --> 15:36.200
And no matter where I am,
I'll never forget you.

15:36.266 --> 15:38.500
This sounds like a goodbye speech.

15:38.567 --> 15:41.533
I'm leaving for Japan.
A team there made me an offer.

15:41.600 --> 15:45.166
Well, what about us?

15:45.233 --> 15:48.633
This is the way baseball works.
I have to move on.

15:48.700 --> 15:51.100
But we make such a great team.

15:51.166 --> 15:54.500
We've had some good times,
but I gotta do this.

15:54.567 --> 15:58.266
Fine. You got to move on, move on.

15:58.734 --> 16:02.367
But, mister, I haven't taught you half
of what I know.

16:12.533 --> 16:14.633
And I wasn't even wearing underwear.

16:15.133 --> 16:19.767
(serene music playing)

16:23.266 --> 16:25.900
I hate men. Stevie's leaving me.

16:26.400 --> 16:30.066
-For another woman?
-Oh, don't be ridiculous. For Tokyo.

16:30.767 --> 16:33.900
Oh, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

16:34.300 --> 16:35.500
What's going on?

16:35.567 --> 16:39.333
Oh, Stevie is leaving Blanche for Tokyo,
Rose.

16:45.934 --> 16:49.533
Well, I can understand that.
She is a big radio personality.

16:51.834 --> 16:55.767
Well, I have my own problems.

16:56.066 --> 16:58.567
I'd share them with you,
but I don't want to bore you.

16:58.633 --> 16:59.900
Thank you.

16:59.967 --> 17:02.734
Blanche, Rose is going through
a very hard time,

17:02.800 --> 17:06.467
but there's something
that'll make her feel much better. Ma?

17:06.533 --> 17:08.867
-Don't you have something to say?
-Yeah.

17:09.600 --> 17:11.800
How come when your head moves
your hair doesn't?

17:14.266 --> 17:17.367
Ma, that's a question,
granted, a very good question,

17:17.433 --> 17:19.266
but we're looking for a statement.

17:19.333 --> 17:20.934
All right. All right.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.266
Charlie wasn't here.

17:23.333 --> 17:25.967
It was me playing a joke on you.

17:26.834 --> 17:28.934
Hello, Rose.

17:30.333 --> 17:34.133
One second, Charlie. What do you mean
it wasn't you, Sophia?

17:37.834 --> 17:43.266
Ma was playing a very mean trick on you,
although now I can see the temptation.

17:45.367 --> 17:49.800
It was a bad joke, and I didn't realize
what it was doing to you.

17:49.867 --> 17:51.333
Bad joke?

17:51.767 --> 17:54.200
It wasn't a joke at all.

17:54.734 --> 17:57.600
You mocked my relationship with Charlie.

17:57.667 --> 18:03.100
And you ruined my friendship with Miles.
How can you be so cruel?

18:04.300 --> 18:09.800
(calm music playing)

18:12.967 --> 18:17.433
-Rose, we have to talk.
-I'm not talking to you.

18:18.133 --> 18:21.266
That was the worst thing
you've ever done to me.

18:21.333 --> 18:24.834
Worse than the time I buried you up
to your neck in sand

18:24.900 --> 18:27.934
and let the children throw baseballs
at you for 25 cents?

18:29.400 --> 18:32.266
Well, I can't hold that against you.
That was for charity.

18:33.133 --> 18:35.166
Yeah, right, charity.

18:36.066 --> 18:39.800
Forget it, Sophia.
Impersonating Charlie was horrible.

18:39.867 --> 18:42.333
Okay, I made a mistake.

18:42.800 --> 18:45.967
But not as big as the one you'll make
if you don't get back with Miles.

18:46.033 --> 18:51.033
Charlie loved you for over 30 years,
but he's gone now...

18:51.433 --> 18:53.533
and you've met someone you care about.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.800
What do you think Charlie would say?

18:56.700 --> 18:58.367
I think he'd say he loves me.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.100
What about the ring?

19:00.567 --> 19:03.433
He'd probably say it was okay to wear
Miles' ring...

19:03.834 --> 19:08.300
because Miles can love me in a way
that he can't right now.

19:08.367 --> 19:11.367
-There you go, Rose.
-(doorbell rings)

19:11.800 --> 19:15.066
That must be Miles.
I told him I'd explain.

19:19.300 --> 19:21.567
You, uh, said you wanted to see me?

19:23.000 --> 19:27.934
Yes, Miles. I'm sorry for all the trouble
I caused.

19:28.367 --> 19:33.400
Although I love you very much,
I was scared of commitment.

19:34.033 --> 19:38.867
In a way, I wanted to believe
that Charlie was trying to contact me.

19:38.934 --> 19:41.100
Oh, sweetheart,
there's nothing to be scared of.

19:41.633 --> 19:45.934
When you're ready to wear the ring,
it's right here in my pocket.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.900
I'm ready to wear the ring.

19:48.533 --> 19:49.934
It's right here in my pocket.

19:52.967 --> 19:55.767
Come on, Rose. It's right here
in my pock--

19:55.834 --> 19:58.000
Oh, Sophia. Uh...

19:58.567 --> 19:59.767
whoo.

20:03.600 --> 20:05.500
I didn't see her sitting there.

20:06.934 --> 20:08.900
Oh, Miles.

20:12.100 --> 20:13.867
Get it while you're young, baby.

20:15.166 --> 20:19.133
Rose, come on. I've got a great idea.

20:19.533 --> 20:23.400
You ever watch that romantic cruise
that leaves at 6pm from the pier?

20:23.467 --> 20:26.000
-Oh, Miles.
-Let's watch it again.

20:29.867 --> 20:31.667
Well, I finally finished my letter.

20:32.200 --> 20:36.567
I got everything down,
every little hurt out.

20:37.367 --> 20:38.533
This is to me.

20:39.433 --> 20:43.367
I found out during the process
that pop was a pretty good father,

20:43.433 --> 20:45.900
but I never really told him I loved him,
so...

20:46.500 --> 20:50.867
-I want to make sure I tell you.
-Oh, pussycat.

20:53.433 --> 20:59.467
"Dear Ma, thanks for giving me life
and thanks for making it good.

20:59.834 --> 21:00.900
I love you."

21:01.500 --> 21:03.266
And I love you too, pussycat.

21:03.700 --> 21:05.300
And I love you too.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.367
And I'm glad you're my mom.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.467
-And I'm glad you're my baby.
-(doorbell rings)

21:10.533 --> 21:12.767
That's probably the schmaltz police.

21:21.567 --> 21:22.967
Oh, no.

21:31.200 --> 21:33.667
This is too funny. Blanche!

21:36.834 --> 21:38.033
Stevie?

21:38.734 --> 21:41.166
What happened to you?

21:41.467 --> 21:44.200
What's happened to me
is the most wonderful thing

21:44.266 --> 21:45.633
that could happen to a man.

21:48.200 --> 21:49.867
And it's all because of you.

21:50.500 --> 21:56.333
For the first time in my life,
I'm batting .310, and I like myself.

21:58.467 --> 22:01.834
Oh, Blanche, you really know
how to mold a man.

22:03.967 --> 22:07.166
He comes in Steve and goes out Eydie.

22:11.667 --> 22:13.200
I've thought about what you said,

22:13.266 --> 22:15.900
and going to Japan is not worth losing
you.

22:16.266 --> 22:18.600
You and me, Blanche, we are a team.

22:18.667 --> 22:20.767
This is too funny.

22:22.700 --> 22:24.100
I don't have to leave the country.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.967
With you coaching me
I can make the big leagues right here.

22:27.266 --> 22:30.767
And we'll still have each other.
Let's go celebrate.

22:33.033 --> 22:35.600
I'm sorry, but I cannot go out
with you tonight.

22:36.266 --> 22:37.600
It's the dress, isn't it?

22:39.333 --> 22:41.200
It's not the dress.

22:41.767 --> 22:43.800
Well, you were ready to write me
off yesterday.

22:43.867 --> 22:48.200
Coming back here cannot take away all
the pain and hurt that I felt.

22:48.266 --> 22:51.767
I cannot forgive you. Goodbye, Stevie.

22:59.834 --> 23:01.400
It was the dress.

23:11.000 --> 23:15.467
(theme music playing)
