- What's up, homies?
- Yo.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.663
Of course it's not a ghost.
Ghosts don't exist.

08:16.829 --> 08:18.873
Now, can we please
just gather ourselves?

08:18.998 --> 08:20.609
We can go up to the roof
and watch the super moon.

08:20.734 --> 08:22.076
All right, you know what?
Take Adam with you.

08:22.201 --> 08:23.461
It's fine.
He's too scared anyways.

08:23.627 --> 08:24.746
The, uh, the spirits,
they feed off fear.

08:24.871 --> 08:25.813
Okay, let's go.

08:25.938 --> 08:26.769
Yeah, he's like a little

08:26.894 --> 08:28.407
all-you-can-eat buffet over there.

08:28.532 --> 08:30.519
Fuck you!

08:30.644 --> 08:32.971
Fuck you, dude!

08:33.136 --> 08:34.256
- Ders.
- Yeah?

08:34.381 --> 08:35.990
- Go do your nerd stuff.
- What?

08:36.115 --> 08:37.592
'cause I have something
to prove to this idiot.

08:37.717 --> 08:39.628
Okay, no more HBO for you.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.062
You are cussing way too much lately.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.764
You deserve this.
You deserve each other.

08:42.889 --> 08:44.866
Well, I'm gonna go watch
the super moon by myself!

08:44.991 --> 08:47.569
And you're gonna be
super sorry about it, okay?

08:47.694 --> 08:48.637
Move your cart.

08:48.762 --> 08:50.742
This old fart cart of farts.

08:50.867 --> 08:52.740
All right, hey, so are you
sure you're ready, huh?

08:52.906 --> 08:55.710
I'm not just sure...

08:55.835 --> 08:59.113
[Whispering]
I'm HIV-positive.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.448
But y-you're not though, right?

09:00.573 --> 09:01.749
- I'm not what?
- HIV-positive.

09:01.874 --> 09:02.917
You just said you're HIV-positive.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.152
No, I did not mean to say that.

09:04.277 --> 09:07.121
- Okay. Okay.
- Very tired.

09:07.246 --> 09:08.990
You've got a weird amount of candles.

09:09.115 --> 09:10.492
- [Cart clangs]
- Shh!

09:10.617 --> 09:11.793
[Whispers] Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry.

09:11.918 --> 09:13.828
It's all right.

09:13.953 --> 09:15.297
The phantomspotter app

09:15.422 --> 09:17.632
detects electromagnetic frequencies.

09:17.757 --> 09:18.700
- Really?
- Yes.

09:18.825 --> 09:20.101
Heavy concentrations

09:20.267 --> 09:23.229
indicate supernatural activity.

09:23.395 --> 09:25.940
Oh, but look at this!

09:26.106 --> 09:28.476
I'm getting a reading
of five black cats

09:28.601 --> 09:30.737
right by the chair
where Homegirl died.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.638
- Who?
- Homegirl.

09:32.763 --> 09:33.740
She... she worked here.

09:33.906 --> 09:35.700
You pulled your testicles out,

09:35.866 --> 09:37.535
put 'em on her forehead,
then she passed away.

09:37.701 --> 09:40.288
Oh, yeah.
Really nice black lady?

09:40.413 --> 09:42.749
No. Quite the opposite.
Very mean white lady.

09:42.915 --> 09:45.001
I don't think I was here
that day then.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.669
What? Yes.
You put your balls on her head.

09:46.835 --> 09:48.029
OK... well, I do that to people.

09:48.154 --> 09:50.365
[Crash]

09:50.490 --> 09:53.625
What was that?

09:55.000 --> 10:01.074

10:02.502 --> 10:05.447
Oh, my gosh, it's all true.

10:05.572 --> 10:08.216
Tens of thousands of child murders.

10:08.341 --> 10:11.586
Dogs sucking each other's
magic sticks.

10:11.711 --> 10:12.554
Rahh!

10:12.679 --> 10:13.588
[Shrieks]

10:13.713 --> 10:14.781
Oh!

10:14.947 --> 10:16.824
- Oh! Kill him! Kill him!
- Die, ghost!

10:16.990 --> 10:18.326
- Kill him! Kill him!
- Oh, die!

10:18.492 --> 10:20.787
- Die ghost! Die!
- Stop!

10:20.953 --> 10:22.288
Oh, I'm punching Ders.

10:22.454 --> 10:23.748
- Dude, stop!
- Oh, that was Ders.

10:23.914 --> 10:25.199
- Oh, God.
- [Groans]

10:25.324 --> 10:26.568
Oh, man, I didn't know it was you...

10:26.693 --> 10:28.570
till I did.
I actually did at the end.

10:28.695 --> 10:30.905
I mean, you get into
some sort of street brawl,

10:31.030 --> 10:32.774
I have... I have no fear
when it comes to fighting.

10:32.899 --> 10:34.041
You guys are idiots.

10:34.166 --> 10:35.343
Well, what the freakin' eff, Ders?

10:35.509 --> 10:37.479
Scared the s-s-shoot out of us.

10:37.604 --> 10:38.763
I found the painting in the garbage

10:38.929 --> 10:40.348
and I thought I'd freak you out.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.225
- And you hit me.
- Oh, that wasn't good, man.

10:42.391 --> 10:44.686
I'm on, like,
285 hours of energy right now.

10:44.852 --> 10:46.120
What is this?
[Lips smack]

10:46.245 --> 10:47.322
That's barbeque sauce.
Very clever, dude.

10:47.447 --> 10:48.565
- I know.
- Very clever, man.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.358
Doll's clothes from the basement.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.894
God, I... it's actually awesome
that I got you guys,

10:53.019 --> 10:54.663
but then you...
can we just please

10:54.788 --> 10:56.431
go to the roof...
[Swallows]

10:56.556 --> 10:58.127
And gaze at the super moon already?

10:58.252 --> 10:59.133
I guess.

10:59.258 --> 11:01.469
[Distant scream]

11:01.594 --> 11:02.453
Ders?

11:02.619 --> 11:03.997
That wasn't me.

11:04.230 --> 11:05.407
Oh, my gosh.

11:05.532 --> 11:06.941
When Adam punched through
that portrait

11:07.066 --> 11:08.576
of Dr. Telamericorp,

11:08.701 --> 11:11.170
he broke whatever supernatural
seal was keeping him in.

11:11.336 --> 11:12.589
- What?
- Yeah.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.650
And now we're the only ones
that can put him back.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.252
- Come on!
- Come on, now, w... hey!

11:18.377 --> 11:19.429
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa.

11:19.595 --> 11:20.622
The devil's in the machine!

11:20.747 --> 11:22.015
It's gone pure black!

11:22.181 --> 11:23.425
It's not on.

11:23.550 --> 11:24.826
- Huh?
- It's sleeping.

11:24.951 --> 11:25.827
You just gotta hit
the thing on the back.

11:25.952 --> 11:27.195
- Sleep...
- Yeah.

11:27.320 --> 11:28.596
This thing's actually cool, man.

11:28.721 --> 11:30.315
- Have you checked out the user interface?
- Oh!

11:40.647 --> 11:42.891
{pub}- Shh! Shh!
- Dude, what are you doing?

11:43.016 --> 11:44.826
- Quiet, quiet, quiet.
- Oh, dear.

11:44.951 --> 11:46.795
Those were Montez's speakers.

11:46.920 --> 11:49.298
- Whatever.
- Shh, guys...

11:49.423 --> 11:51.700
This thing is really humming.

11:51.825 --> 11:54.547
There is a lot of activity down here.

11:54.713 --> 11:55.737
Look, dudes.
Dudes, dudes, dudes!

11:56.863 --> 11:58.134
Dr. Telamericorp!

11:58.300 --> 11:59.374
He's crossed over
into the physical world!

11:59.499 --> 12:00.475
It's only a matter of time

12:00.600 --> 12:01.543
before he finds a human host!

12:01.668 --> 12:02.844
- What?
- Okay. Yep.

12:02.969 --> 12:05.350
You're not gonna get me twice, Ders.

12:05.516 --> 12:08.217
I think I know barbeque sauce
when I see it.

12:08.342 --> 12:09.312
Now.
This time I do.

12:09.478 --> 12:10.952
Adam, no.
I didn't...

12:11.077 --> 12:13.455
that's not barbeque s...!

12:13.580 --> 12:17.226
- That's not barbeque sauce.
- No.

12:17.351 --> 12:18.488
I think that's blood.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.365
[Squeamish]
I think it's blood.

12:20.531 --> 12:23.409
- Okay, so, I know that this is blood.
- Wait, stop it!

12:23.657 --> 12:24.700
Don't!

12:24.825 --> 12:25.900
And it tastes exactly like that!

12:26.025 --> 12:27.302
That is blood!
That is <i>blood!</i>

12:27.427 --> 12:28.831
I am HIV-positive!

12:28.997 --> 12:30.472
- What did you...
- No, I'm saying it this time!

12:30.597 --> 12:32.541
- I think I'm HIV-positive.
- Can you feel it?

12:32.666 --> 12:34.212
That's how...
that's how you get HIV!

12:34.378 --> 12:35.944
You get it by tasting
strange blood on the ground!

12:36.069 --> 12:37.346
- Yes.
- We have to make you a quilt!

12:37.471 --> 12:38.447
We have to make him a quilt.
[Door closes]

12:38.572 --> 12:39.481
[All scream]

12:39.606 --> 12:40.647
- What was that?
- Oh, God.

12:40.772 --> 12:42.684
Dr. Telamericorp.
He's looking for a host.

12:42.809 --> 12:43.818
We don't have en...
no time!

12:43.943 --> 12:45.014
We've got no time!

12:45.180 --> 12:46.154
So you know who we have to call.

12:46.279 --> 12:47.155
We gotta call the cops, man.

12:47.280 --> 12:48.156
There's blood everywhere.

12:48.281 --> 12:49.358
I'm calling the cops.

12:49.483 --> 12:51.270
I was thinking the gh... never mind.

12:51.651 --> 12:52.861
I know a satanic ritual

12:52.986 --> 12:56.231
that'll send his spirit back to hell.

12:56.356 --> 12:57.866
You know a satanic ritual?

12:57.991 --> 13:00.168
[Stammering]
It's a... h-hell way?

13:00.293 --> 13:03.829
Okay, well, I think I'm gonna
go to the little boy's room.

13:04.408 --> 13:06.408
Not because I'm a little boy
who's scared,

13:06.533 --> 13:08.121
but because I'm a little man
who ate too many tacos.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.444
- So I'm gonna go...
- Wait, dude...

13:09.569 --> 13:10.998
gotta... gotta poo.

13:11.164 --> 13:12.347
All right, man.
What are... what are we doing?

13:12.472 --> 13:14.168
What are we doing?
Tell me what to do.

13:14.408 --> 13:16.295
We need a sacrifice.

13:16.461 --> 13:19.254
[Panting]

13:19.379 --> 13:20.455
[Bottle clatters]

13:20.580 --> 13:22.357
Come on, Demamp!

13:22.482 --> 13:24.159
Pull yourself together.

13:24.284 --> 13:25.894
You taught yourself Spanish,

13:26.019 --> 13:27.862
you can make it
through this, "muchaycho."

13:27.987 --> 13:30.523
[Stall door snaps shut]

13:31.725 --> 13:37.095
[Hysterical laugh]

13:40.861 --> 13:43.948
[Fuzzy distortion]

13:44.170 --> 13:48.373
[Panting]

13:49.676 --> 13:52.248
Okay, let's see what we got in here.

13:52.479 --> 13:53.755
Uh, yogurt, hummus,

13:53.880 --> 13:55.710
purple stuff, sunny d.

13:55.876 --> 13:57.392
The ritual calls for the flesh

13:57.517 --> 13:58.713
of thy untouched beast.

13:58.879 --> 13:59.881
Um, oh.

14:00.047 --> 14:01.591
Montez's ground hamburger beef?

14:01.757 --> 14:03.131
- Perfect.
- All right.

14:03.256 --> 14:04.599
Let's bring this meatloaf
to meat life.

14:04.724 --> 14:05.595
Let's do it.

14:07.794 --> 14:09.070
Who's in here, huh?

14:09.195 --> 14:10.171
[Screaming]
Huh?

14:10.296 --> 14:11.673
You comin' at me?

14:11.798 --> 14:13.342
I ain't scared of no ghost.

14:13.467 --> 14:14.509
I'm not scared of you!
[Distant moan]

14:14.634 --> 14:17.713
Who did that?
Who did that?

14:17.838 --> 14:18.913
[Laughing]

14:19.038 --> 14:20.014
We've already said too much!

14:20.139 --> 14:21.650
[Sobbing]

14:21.775 --> 14:23.585
[Screaming]
What?

14:23.710 --> 14:26.120
[Baby crying]

14:26.245 --> 14:28.367
I'm the main office prankster.
Did you miss me?

14:28.533 --> 14:29.452
I tea-bagged your dead body.

14:29.618 --> 14:30.525
Ooh.

14:30.650 --> 14:32.663
[Distant screeching]

14:32.829 --> 14:35.664
What is happening to me?!

14:36.957 --> 14:38.834
[Eerie music]

14:38.959 --> 14:41.770
Dr. Telamericorp.

14:41.895 --> 14:43.299
Oh, no.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.965
You want me to kill Montez,
don't you?

14:46.385 --> 14:48.513
That's what you're doing here, huh?

14:50.136 --> 14:51.974
You know what?
I'll do it.

14:52.140 --> 14:56.251
I'm here to help you sleep.

14:56.376 --> 14:58.620
But you can't fall asleep

14:58.745 --> 15:01.656
until you silence the music.

15:01.781 --> 15:05.488
Let no one stand in your way.

15:05.654 --> 15:07.028
Why me?

15:07.153 --> 15:10.201
Because, you're a strong boy, Adam.

15:12.091 --> 15:13.402
Mm-hmm.

15:13.527 --> 15:16.499
Strong little boy.

15:18.331 --> 15:21.420
[Child's voice]
Strong little boy.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.147
Oh, yeah.
Sweet meat fetus, dude.

15:26.272 --> 15:27.849
- Thank you.
- Looks real as hell.

15:27.974 --> 15:28.917
Yeah, it does, doesn't it?

15:29.042 --> 15:30.318
Yeah, if you could, uh,

15:30.443 --> 15:32.521
just, like, stand him up
and make him look alive.

15:32.646 --> 15:33.988
Yeah. That should not
be a problem, dude.

15:34.113 --> 15:35.590
I used to stand up
armies of action figures

15:35.715 --> 15:36.925
against each other.

15:37.050 --> 15:38.827
- Do these, like, cool wars.
- Great, great.

15:38.952 --> 15:40.228
- There we go.
- That's a cool story.

15:40.353 --> 15:41.897
Thanks.
Okay. All right, you know what?

15:42.022 --> 15:43.732
Sorry, I used to have
the same problem when I would

15:43.857 --> 15:45.334
stand those action figures up
against each other for wars.

15:45.459 --> 15:46.946
Whatever, that's fine...
I'm sure Satan doesn't really care.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.240
- Here we go.
- [Exhales]

15:49.462 --> 15:51.139
[Moaning]

15:51.264 --> 15:55.009
- Spirit of Dr. Telamericorp!
- Yeah.

15:55.134 --> 15:58.447
Please accept this humble sacrifice

15:58.572 --> 16:02.851
of a live, super moonwalking...

16:02.976 --> 16:08.557
Ginger beef man!

16:08.682 --> 16:10.725
<i>Have a namaste.</i>
Amen.

16:10.850 --> 16:13.389
[Child's voice]
Silence the music.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.430
A-Adam, what...
what...

16:15.555 --> 16:16.809
what's up?
What's wrong?
