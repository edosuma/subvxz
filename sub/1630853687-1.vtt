02:08.600 --> 02:10.680
So, right here on this very spot

02:10.760 --> 02:12.960
is where most of the victims fell

02:13.040 --> 02:15.480
as they were running away from the police.

02:17.320 --> 02:19.000
Most of them were shot in the back.

02:19.080 --> 02:22.000
You know, that tells you
the story of what really happened here.

02:23.600 --> 02:24.640
Bam!

02:25.280 --> 02:26.320
Pow!

02:26.400 --> 02:29.360
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

02:31.080 --> 02:32.080
To date…

02:32.720 --> 02:35.880
not one single police officer
or their superiors

02:36.600 --> 02:38.280
took responsibility for that.

02:38.880 --> 02:40.440
Nobody has gone to jail.

02:41.240 --> 02:43.400
No one has come forward to say,

02:43.480 --> 02:48.240
"I am sorry for the 69 Black souls
that died here that day."

02:48.320 --> 02:50.760
Hey! Hey, you fool!

02:50.840 --> 02:52.680
Lives, not souls!

02:52.760 --> 02:55.480
How many times must I tell you, stupid?

02:55.560 --> 02:57.800
Oh, Mam' Zikode.
It's the same, lives, souls.

02:57.880 --> 02:59.080
It's the same, man.

02:59.160 --> 03:02.040
- Lives end, souls continue.

03:02.120 --> 03:04.920
-Don't mind them. Focus on me.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.640
They're just here to pray.

03:08.480 --> 03:10.360
What are they praying for?

03:10.440 --> 03:14.600
They're praying so that
this sort of thing does not repeat itself.

03:14.680 --> 03:18.080
So they've been
praying like this since 1960?

03:18.160 --> 03:20.000
No. No, no, of course not.

03:20.880 --> 03:23.760
They just took after their predecessors,

03:23.840 --> 03:29.000
and then they will carry over the task
of praying to the next generation.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.520
Don't pay too much attention to them.
They're just a bunch of crazy nyangas.

03:32.600 --> 03:33.760
But I want to watch.

03:33.840 --> 03:35.760
You don't see
this sort of thing every day.

05:01.640 --> 05:05.480
The Vaal River is 1,120 kilometers long.

05:05.560 --> 05:07.880
And it is fully developed economically.

05:07.960 --> 05:10.560
And normally
during this time of day

05:10.640 --> 05:13.960
you see the boats
going up and down, and parties…

05:14.040 --> 05:16.680
But the price of petrol is very high now.

05:19.000 --> 05:23.440
So this water is used domestically
and for industrial purposes.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.920
This river is
the lifeblood of the Vaal Triangle.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.960
All right, let's go to our next point.

05:31.040 --> 05:33.600
And please keep your belongings very safe.

05:33.680 --> 05:36.600
And if you don't trust anyone, trust me.

05:38.560 --> 05:39.600
Let's go.

05:41.320 --> 05:42.800
Madam, can I carry you?

05:43.280 --> 05:44.920
Hey, missy.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.640
Come on, we're going.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.800
Coming.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.080
You don't want to get lost here.

05:53.520 --> 05:54.920
Won't get lost here.

06:18.880 --> 06:20.000
Grandma?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.560
It's time to eat.

06:23.520 --> 06:25.320
I will eat later, my child.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.720
But…

06:26.800 --> 06:28.000
you haven't eaten.

06:28.680 --> 06:32.200
I can't inject you on an empty stomach.

06:33.120 --> 06:34.520
I'm not hungry.

06:35.320 --> 06:36.960
If you won't eat, I won't either.

06:37.040 --> 06:38.640
Oh no…

06:38.720 --> 06:40.640
are you going to starve yourself?

06:40.720 --> 06:43.320
If that's what
it will take to make you eat.

06:44.800 --> 06:48.440
All right then, I will eat.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.440
Sit up, Grandma.

07:08.800 --> 07:10.200
Just a little.

07:12.320 --> 07:15.680
I pray my ancestors protect you, my child.

07:17.400 --> 07:21.600
I'm sure they have more
important things to worry about.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.120
Don't act like our ancestors don't exist.

07:28.840 --> 07:30.280
If they existed…

07:33.520 --> 07:35.560
would they have allowed all of this?

07:36.640 --> 07:40.280
You're just looking at the bad

07:40.360 --> 07:42.800
and ignoring all the good they've done.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.040
Like what?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.880
Like you, my child?

07:47.840 --> 07:50.040
I wish I was enough.

07:50.640 --> 07:51.560
My child…

07:51.640 --> 07:52.680
You're enough.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.520
No, Grandma, don't say that.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.560
Bring that here.
I will feed myself.

08:08.720 --> 08:09.720
Goodness.

08:10.600 --> 08:12.640
Doesn't look like it's enough.

08:14.800 --> 08:15.880
Ah…

08:19.520 --> 08:20.440
Make it more.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.960
No, I'm not making that mistake again.

08:23.040 --> 08:24.800
You will go into shock again.

08:24.880 --> 08:25.840
Hmm.

08:32.040 --> 08:35.000
Do you want to finish your food
before your injection?

08:36.360 --> 08:38.480
I would like you…

08:39.840 --> 08:41.520
to finish your education.

08:41.600 --> 08:42.720
Oh, Grandma.

08:43.440 --> 08:44.840
Let me do the injection.

08:44.920 --> 08:47.240
-Give it. I will inject myself.
-No, Grandma.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.280
-Hey.
-Hey.

10:15.920 --> 10:17.120
You sleep all right?

10:17.200 --> 10:18.760
Oh, wonderful.

10:19.400 --> 10:22.200
Well, you've obviously been here before.

10:22.280 --> 10:25.160
The Vaal? Not really.

10:26.840 --> 10:28.200
Well, which is it then?

10:30.000 --> 10:32.200
I was almost born here.

10:32.720 --> 10:34.600
My father was stationed here in the '60s,

10:34.680 --> 10:36.840
and I was born just after in Cape Town.

10:36.920 --> 10:40.960
So I missed out on all the action
that made this place famous.

10:41.040 --> 10:43.160
Well, I'm not sure I'd put it like that.

10:44.200 --> 10:46.200
Sorry. Bad joke, I know.

10:47.200 --> 10:48.800
I imagine the people around here

10:48.880 --> 10:51.080
find similar ways
to cope with their grief.

10:51.720 --> 10:53.040
By telling bad jokes?

10:53.120 --> 10:54.200
I would.

10:54.280 --> 10:58.640
Oh! And how's that tour guide?
Is he really the best we can do?

10:59.600 --> 11:00.640
He's bad.

11:01.640 --> 11:03.040
-He's bad.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.920
He's a madman.

11:08.960 --> 11:10.320
How do you cope?

11:10.400 --> 11:11.560
Cope with what?

11:11.640 --> 11:13.160
Well, with whatever.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.000
Aren't we all coping with something?

11:16.080 --> 11:19.560
Yeah, I always think that
people who visit memorials

11:19.640 --> 11:23.680
to events that happened
years after they were even born,

11:23.760 --> 11:27.360
well, they must be looking
for something to scratch that itch.

11:29.480 --> 11:32.080
That would depend on
which side of the event you're on.

11:32.160 --> 11:33.520
Yeah, I suppose.

11:34.920 --> 11:36.400
Why are you here?

11:37.520 --> 11:39.360
White guilt, what else?

11:41.720 --> 11:42.800
Karma…

11:43.800 --> 11:45.280
Karma what?

11:45.360 --> 11:46.680
That's the reason I'm here.

11:46.760 --> 11:50.040
Taking photographs for travel brochures.

11:50.120 --> 11:51.680
Travel brochures?

11:52.560 --> 11:54.040
That's very exciting.

11:56.840 --> 11:59.920
Whose cat did you kill in your past life?

12:00.000 --> 12:01.120
Ah!

12:01.200 --> 12:03.200
-I suppose we should get going.

12:03.280 --> 12:05.800
We leave in 20 minutes.
Let's get something to eat.

12:06.280 --> 12:10.000
Hunger and a hot head, not a good combo.

12:10.080 --> 12:11.600
Yeah, you're telling me.

12:12.160 --> 12:14.160
Just yesterday my head was spinning.

12:14.920 --> 12:16.160
Made me see things.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.600
What things?

12:19.840 --> 12:21.440
I saw a man in the smoke.

12:21.960 --> 12:23.760
There's plenty of those around here.

12:23.840 --> 12:26.080
There's one sitting right in front of you.

12:26.160 --> 12:29.200
Bit worse for wear but, uh, still…

12:29.800 --> 12:32.000
Sorry, Sean, I bat for the other team.

12:32.080 --> 12:33.240
Oh!

12:33.320 --> 12:35.920
I would never have guessed. I mean…

12:36.440 --> 12:38.440
Well, it's fine by me.

12:41.000 --> 12:43.920
I do hope they
have more surprises in today's tour.

12:44.000 --> 12:46.240
I wouldn't hold my breath
to time immemorial.

12:46.920 --> 12:51.480
Well, we are touring
the memorial of a massacre,

12:51.560 --> 12:53.200
not the Grand Rapids.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.760
Well, I want more bang-bang for my buck.

12:58.120 --> 13:00.960
I hope you find
something, um, interesting.

13:01.040 --> 13:02.160
Maybe.

13:03.280 --> 13:04.800
Maybe I already have.

13:47.120 --> 13:48.600
Oh, sorry.

13:48.680 --> 13:50.480
Ah. You.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.760
Uh, can I take your picture?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.920
Go to the river.

14:02.080 --> 14:04.400
I went to the river.
There's not much there.

14:04.480 --> 14:05.520
She waits for you.

14:10.880 --> 14:12.360
The river waits for me?

14:15.960 --> 14:16.800
But…

15:31.440 --> 15:32.960
-Woo!
-Thank you.

15:47.160 --> 15:48.840
Hey. Stop.

15:48.920 --> 15:51.320
Why? Don't you like pictures?

15:51.880 --> 15:53.000
It's rude.

15:53.600 --> 15:57.160
Oh. I'm sorry, it's just…
it's just photos.

15:59.160 --> 16:01.160
The memorial is over there.

16:01.240 --> 16:02.520
Okay, I'm not on display.

16:02.600 --> 16:04.440
<i> I didn't</i>
<i>come here for the memorial.</i>

16:04.520 --> 16:06.040
<i>Well, sorry for you.</i>

16:06.760 --> 16:08.520
<i>All the fun stuff is over there.</i>

16:09.280 --> 16:11.480
I think that you're more fun.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.760
No, I'm not.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.440
<i>Can I ask you a favor?</i>

16:18.640 --> 16:20.440
Will you show me around?

16:21.080 --> 16:22.200
Be my tour guide.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.320
<i>Oh, come on, I'm serious. Please.</i>

16:25.400 --> 16:28.680
<i>You live here. You know the area.</i>
<i>You know all the interesting places.</i>

16:28.760 --> 16:31.480
That, um, tour guide
that we've got, he's just…

16:32.040 --> 16:33.120
Anyway.

16:33.680 --> 16:36.000
I would love it if you showed me around.

16:36.080 --> 16:37.400
Are you serious?

16:37.480 --> 16:38.680
I can pay you.

16:39.280 --> 16:40.440
How much?

16:40.520 --> 16:42.040
A hundred rand a day?

16:43.640 --> 16:44.920
Let me think about it.

16:45.000 --> 16:46.320
Oh, what's there to think about?

16:46.400 --> 16:48.000
Uh, I have things to do.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.680
Like what?

16:55.640 --> 16:57.360
None of your business.

17:02.040 --> 17:02.920
Wait.

17:03.600 --> 17:04.880
Here is my number.

17:05.560 --> 17:06.760
<i>Give me a call…</i>

17:07.480 --> 17:09.440
when you've given it some thought.

17:10.640 --> 17:12.120
My name is Tyra Black.

17:12.800 --> 17:14.080
<i>From Cape Town.</i>

17:16.360 --> 17:19.160
Siya, from… here.

17:27.080 --> 17:28.120
<i> Siya…</i>

17:30.680 --> 17:31.920
Siya.

17:59.680 --> 18:00.720
Hey.

18:02.200 --> 18:04.680
-How did you find me?
-It wasn't that hard.

18:05.800 --> 18:07.960
You're very strange, eh?

18:08.040 --> 18:10.440
I take my tours very seriously.

18:11.160 --> 18:12.640
Look, Miss…

18:12.720 --> 18:13.600
Tyra.

18:16.200 --> 18:18.280
Miss Tyra, my grandmother's very sick.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.840
I can't leave her alone for too long.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.920
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

18:23.000 --> 18:23.960
Please.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.200
Call me Tyra, just Tyra.

18:30.480 --> 18:31.960
Can I give you a hand with this?

18:33.080 --> 18:35.440
I'm figuring the sooner
we get your chores done,

18:35.520 --> 18:37.160
the sooner we can get to my tour.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.600
No, no, no, I didn't say
I was going to do your tour.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.400
Yes, but you didn't say you weren’t
going to do it either, did you?

18:49.160 --> 18:50.920
Okay, this can't be too hard.

19:00.360 --> 19:02.840
This is where
I saw you for the first time.

19:05.120 --> 19:06.880
I thought it was on the street.

19:06.960 --> 19:09.960
No, that's where we met,
not where I saw you.

19:10.040 --> 19:13.600
Also, even that didn't
feel like the first time.

19:14.560 --> 19:15.680
What do you mean?

19:15.760 --> 19:17.000
Well, you know…

19:17.720 --> 19:18.960
You feel so familiar.

19:19.040 --> 19:22.320
It's as if I've known,
as if we knew each other before.

19:22.400 --> 19:26.680
Are you sure that's not because
all you people think we look the same?

19:26.760 --> 19:28.800
No.

19:29.520 --> 19:30.760
My father always used to say,

19:30.840 --> 19:34.040
"If there is a mystery,
then the simplest answer is the answer."

19:36.680 --> 19:37.920
Was he a teacher?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.280
-Who?
-Your father.

19:41.440 --> 19:42.440
A cop.

19:43.520 --> 19:45.200
I can see why you come here.

19:45.960 --> 19:48.280
-Why?
-The river.

19:49.160 --> 19:51.440
<i>Always flowing in one direction.</i>

19:51.520 --> 19:53.800
<i>A bit like time, just moving ahead</i>

19:53.880 --> 19:57.120
<i>taking you with it</i>
<i>to where you need to be.</i>

20:08.280 --> 20:09.320
Siya.

20:14.440 --> 20:16.480
-I have to go.
-Why?

20:19.120 --> 20:20.000
Wait.

20:23.520 --> 20:26.280
-Oh. I didn't show you much.
-You will.

20:37.560 --> 20:38.600
Hey.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.160
So you're hanging
around white people now?

20:41.240 --> 20:42.560
Oh, please.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.360
Where are you coming from?

20:58.840 --> 21:00.160
Hey…

21:00.240 --> 21:02.040
I'm out of breath.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.720
You know, I suspect…

21:06.800 --> 21:08.880
-you gave me a love potion.

21:08.960 --> 21:10.480
Do you blame me?

21:10.960 --> 21:12.240
Not at all.

21:12.960 --> 21:14.400
I'd do the same thing.

21:25.520 --> 21:26.600
Mm!

21:31.440 --> 21:33.120
You were seen at the river?

21:34.320 --> 21:35.880
You have a white friend now?

21:37.280 --> 21:38.920
Why? Are you jealous?

21:41.360 --> 21:42.560
Of a white person?

21:42.640 --> 21:44.240
No way.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.040
-Tshepo?

21:47.120 --> 21:48.520
I want to know what she wants.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.760
I don't know either.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.200
She said she wants me to be
her tour guide in Sharpeville.

21:53.800 --> 21:56.560
But I'm not sure.
She seems to want something else.

21:58.160 --> 21:59.480
These white people.

21:59.560 --> 22:03.760
You know, they come here every year,
acting like they care about our tragedy

22:03.840 --> 22:06.040
when they were
the cause of it to begin with.

22:06.120 --> 22:09.600
Think things would have turned out
differently if the massacre didn't happen?

22:09.680 --> 22:10.920
I don't know.

22:11.000 --> 22:12.680
My grandma might still be alive.

22:12.760 --> 22:15.040
Or maybe she'd have
died of old age anyway.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.400
No, Siya.

22:16.480 --> 22:20.160
Dying from old age is better
than being shot in the back.

22:21.280 --> 22:22.200
Oh.

22:22.280 --> 22:23.360
I don't know.

22:23.880 --> 22:25.240
Death is all the same.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.840
Let's say you had to choose right now

22:27.920 --> 22:29.720
how your grandma dies.

22:29.800 --> 22:31.040
What would you choose?

22:31.120 --> 22:34.120
-Tshepo, we can't talk about that.
-No, let's talk about it.

22:34.200 --> 22:35.360
Choose.

22:37.160 --> 22:38.480
Grandma almost died once.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.120
<i>She overdosed on insulin</i>
<i>when I wasn't around.</i>

22:42.200 --> 22:47.120
Wow. I thought insulin only kills you
when you don't have enough.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.240
No…

22:51.560 --> 22:55.120
But at that moment
I remember thinking to myself

22:55.760 --> 22:58.600
maybe that's the best way for her to go.

22:58.680 --> 23:01.040
Sleeping peacefully.

23:01.640 --> 23:02.760
You see…

23:03.320 --> 23:06.000
I would have preferred that
for my grandmother.

23:06.600 --> 23:07.800
But instead…

23:08.440 --> 23:10.960
we can't forget that
our people died horribly.

23:11.640 --> 23:13.400
How are we supposed to forget

23:13.480 --> 23:16.120
with Mam' Zikode and all her prophets
constantly reminding us?

23:18.240 --> 23:20.480
Yeah, that old lady is crazy.

23:22.120 --> 23:24.000
Apparently, she sees things.

23:29.760 --> 23:30.920
Tell me…

23:31.840 --> 23:33.080
What do you know about her?

23:34.000 --> 23:35.200
Your white friend?

23:36.080 --> 23:37.680
She lives in Cape Town,

23:38.240 --> 23:40.960
she loves taking pictures,
and her father was a cop.

23:44.200 --> 23:46.280
This is starting to make sense.

23:46.360 --> 23:50.080
Her father was a cop that
shot Black people during apartheid.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.160
Now she's shooting Black people
with her camera.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.720
It's just shooting everywhere.

23:56.560 --> 23:57.760
Tshepo, you pulled me away

23:57.840 --> 24:00.040
because you wanted
to talk about the white woman?

24:00.120 --> 24:01.000
Really…

24:01.080 --> 24:04.400
it's not everyday someone you know
becomes the talk of the whole township.

24:04.480 --> 24:06.280
-Who is talking about me?
-Everyone.

24:06.360 --> 24:07.840
How do you think I knew?

24:10.680 --> 24:12.800
You really want to talk about the woman?

24:14.040 --> 24:15.720
I want to know about her.

24:19.280 --> 24:20.200
You know what?

24:20.280 --> 24:22.280
There something else
you want to talk about?

24:22.360 --> 24:23.640
No, forget it.

24:24.320 --> 24:25.440
Wow, Siya.

24:27.040 --> 24:28.120
Siya.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.280
Baby.

24:58.840 --> 25:02.080
And I saw what it was.
It was a puff adder.

25:02.560 --> 25:03.600
Puff adder!

25:03.680 --> 25:07.160
I tell you, I saw that snake
and I just fucking froze.

25:08.320 --> 25:09.720
I know how you feel.

25:10.360 --> 25:12.360
But it's important to confront your fears.

25:12.440 --> 25:15.640
Oh, I confronted my fears.
I confronted that snake and…

25:16.240 --> 25:17.840
And it didn't bite me!

25:21.360 --> 25:22.240
Hey.

25:22.320 --> 25:23.720
What are you doing here?

25:23.800 --> 25:25.120
I'm sorry. I…

25:25.200 --> 25:27.840
My goodness,
that's no way to greet a guest.

25:28.840 --> 25:30.120
Where'd you get the cigarette?

25:30.200 --> 25:31.400
From your friend.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.040
She's been so nice.

25:33.120 --> 25:35.120
We are not friends.

25:35.200 --> 25:36.960
That's not how I see it.

25:49.240 --> 25:51.640
Don't mind her mood.
She's gone through a lot.

25:52.520 --> 25:55.320
Thanks. It's okay.
She doesn't want me here, so…

25:55.400 --> 25:57.840
Thank you for the chat. And the smoke.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.160
You'll come back.

26:00.240 --> 26:01.240
Soon.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.920
-Bye.
-Bye!

26:22.360 --> 26:24.320
You were gone for a long time.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.360
I'm sorry, I lost track of time.

26:26.440 --> 26:27.600
I was with Tshepo.

26:30.080 --> 26:32.800
Did you take this lady's offer?

26:32.880 --> 26:35.880
I heard she offered you a job
and you just left with Tshepo.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.840
So she came to ask for her money back?

26:38.760 --> 26:43.000
No, she said you didn't
want to leave me on my own.

26:43.080 --> 26:45.520
So she decided
to come and keep me company.

26:47.200 --> 26:49.240
I don't know what she wants from us.

26:49.320 --> 26:50.920
What would she want here?

26:52.080 --> 26:54.000
I like her.

26:54.920 --> 26:57.960
She reminds me of someone I know.

26:58.040 --> 26:59.480
And who is that?

26:59.560 --> 27:01.480
Your old boss, Mrs. Leroux?

27:01.560 --> 27:02.600
No.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.520
That fucking bitch.

27:16.160 --> 27:18.200
So these women in Cato Manor,

27:18.280 --> 27:22.080
who for decades have been dependent
on making this home beer for a living,

27:22.160 --> 27:23.840
suddenly found themselves in trouble.

27:24.440 --> 27:28.200
The apartheid government
banned the homemade beer.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.160
And if you were caught, hey,

27:30.240 --> 27:32.760
your house was trashed
or you were thrown into jail.

27:32.840 --> 27:33.800
I'm telling you.

27:33.880 --> 27:36.600
The only way you could sell it
was if you did it underground,

27:36.680 --> 27:38.840
and even then there was trouble.

27:38.920 --> 27:40.840
And to make matters worse,

27:40.920 --> 27:43.360
that's when
the government actually decided

27:43.440 --> 27:46.720
that they were
going to open proper taverns.

27:46.800 --> 27:48.480
You know what proper means?

27:48.560 --> 27:51.800
You no longer
sit on top of crates or box tins.

27:51.880 --> 27:54.320
Do you know?
You sit like this, like white people,

27:54.400 --> 27:57.920
and the beer comes in bottles.
You know, like the Europeans.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.640
Yeah.

28:04.880 --> 28:09.440
Then the men completely forgot
about the women and their homemade beers.

28:09.520 --> 28:12.120
And that made the women very, very mad.

28:12.200 --> 28:14.400
Yeah, that would make me mad too.

28:14.480 --> 28:17.480
What happened next was even more dramatic.

28:17.560 --> 28:18.520
What?

28:19.240 --> 28:22.240
The women got so mad
they started to protest.

28:22.920 --> 28:25.600
They started barricading the streets
to make sure that their men

28:25.680 --> 28:27.960
no longer patronized these taverns.

28:28.040 --> 28:31.440
And, uh, then the men…

28:32.480 --> 28:33.960
called the cops.

28:34.040 --> 28:35.200
Aw. Typical.

28:36.440 --> 28:39.120
The cops arrived
and right there

28:39.200 --> 28:41.400
a full-on riot ensued.

28:41.880 --> 28:44.640
I'm telling you, guns, batons, fire.

28:44.720 --> 28:46.480
Pow! Pow!

28:46.960 --> 28:48.960
Hmm? And in that event

28:49.600 --> 28:50.880
a policeman died.

28:51.720 --> 28:53.320
-Died?
-Died.

28:53.400 --> 28:55.800
Well, hooray to the women, I say.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.840
Yeah, that's the problem.
White people, you just say "hooray."

28:58.920 --> 29:01.000
Hooray? People died there, chief.

29:01.080 --> 29:02.720
People died, chief!

29:03.680 --> 29:05.120
Yes.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.320
But, eight years later,

29:07.400 --> 29:10.160
when the people were
protesting the Pass Laws,

29:10.240 --> 29:12.480
-the same cops were there!

29:12.560 --> 29:16.280
And remember, they still had trauma
of their colleagues dying at that thing.

29:16.360 --> 29:17.560
So what did they do?

29:18.560 --> 29:20.040
-What do they do?
-What?

29:20.120 --> 29:21.600
They opened fire.

29:23.240 --> 29:25.240
Pow! Pow! Pow! Pow!

29:25.320 --> 29:27.480
So you're saying
the trouble happened

29:27.560 --> 29:31.040
because the Apartheid police
were burying an eight-year grudge?

29:31.120 --> 29:32.400
Exactly.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.280
It was revenge, baba.

29:34.360 --> 29:36.240
Sounds like bullshit to me.

29:36.320 --> 29:37.280
Yeah.

29:38.640 --> 29:40.520
What about that is bullshit?

29:40.600 --> 29:43.080
The cops opened fire
because they were afraid.

29:43.160 --> 29:46.640
Apartheid cops didn't need
a reason to fuck you up.

29:46.720 --> 29:48.760
Being Black was
all the reason they needed.

29:48.840 --> 29:53.200
You see, now there's a story
you could tell on your tours.

29:53.280 --> 29:55.400
Yeah, but, you know, it wouldn't help

29:55.480 --> 29:58.040
because it's an old boring story,
isn't it?

29:58.120 --> 30:00.640
Well, that ship's already sailed.

30:16.200 --> 30:17.200
Who's that?

30:20.120 --> 30:23.440
That is my new tour guide.

30:26.760 --> 30:28.120
She's better looking.

30:28.200 --> 30:31.040
Ah, boss. Come on, man.

30:34.920 --> 30:37.480
My grandmother said
I should come and apologize.

30:37.560 --> 30:38.840
I thought as much.

30:39.520 --> 30:41.720
I treated you badly. I'm sorry.

30:41.800 --> 30:43.360
I'm okay. I'm fine.

30:43.840 --> 30:45.640
-Do you want to join us?
-No.

30:45.720 --> 30:47.920
I've accomplished my mission. I should go.

30:48.000 --> 30:49.720
-Okay, let me walk with you.
-Mm-mm.

30:49.800 --> 30:51.320
Oh, don't be silly.

30:53.560 --> 30:55.480
Come to think of it, how did you find me?

30:55.560 --> 30:57.600
I never told you where I was staying.

30:57.680 --> 31:00.880
Oh, everyone knows this is
where all the tourists love to stay.

31:02.760 --> 31:05.160
So how is your dying grandmother?

31:05.240 --> 31:06.720
Yeah, she's okay.

31:07.360 --> 31:09.000
How long has she had diabetes?

31:10.680 --> 31:12.640
She told you.

31:14.680 --> 31:15.800
Too long.

31:16.680 --> 31:17.920
When are you leaving?

31:18.440 --> 31:19.440
I…

31:20.800 --> 31:23.680
I might stay a bit longer
than I initially thought.

31:24.280 --> 31:25.880
Why? Is there something wrong?

31:26.640 --> 31:28.920
Hmm. My work's not finished.

31:29.760 --> 31:32.760
All I've got are a few
boring photographs of the memorial.

31:32.840 --> 31:36.360
Anyone can get that off Google.
I need something more.

31:39.600 --> 31:41.520
What do you need all these pictures for?

31:41.600 --> 31:43.800
It's not for me, it's for my…

31:43.880 --> 31:45.000
Never mind.

31:45.560 --> 31:48.600
Point is, I need some cool pictures.

31:50.040 --> 31:53.440
I'm sure there are
such interesting places around here.

31:54.080 --> 31:55.320
And things.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.520
Point is just to look for the unusual and…

31:59.280 --> 32:01.080
My word, look at you.

32:01.160 --> 32:04.120
You're beautiful, like a jewel.

32:09.440 --> 32:12.480
So, is that what you do? You sell places?

32:13.760 --> 32:15.800
Sell places.

32:15.880 --> 32:18.280
Yes, that's my job for now.

32:18.360 --> 32:20.120
I try to make the best of it,

32:21.000 --> 32:22.440
but this place…

32:23.760 --> 32:27.840
Everyone, everything here
is just so familiar.

32:27.920 --> 32:29.000
And not.

32:29.680 --> 32:31.840
And someone still owes me a tour.

32:33.200 --> 32:34.880
So, where do you want to start?

32:35.640 --> 32:38.280
Maybe start with soaking up the nightlife.

32:39.240 --> 32:40.760
You mean like camping?

32:41.360 --> 32:43.720
No. Like partying.

32:46.640 --> 32:47.640
Hmm?

32:49.360 --> 32:50.560
Hmm.

32:54.000 --> 32:55.480
<i> I can dance for you.</i>

32:56.560 --> 32:58.600
-<i>What?</i>
-<i>You heard me.</i>

32:59.320 --> 33:00.760
<i>Why?</i>

33:01.360 --> 33:03.840
<i> I'd rather you than some stranger.</i>

33:04.440 --> 33:07.040
<i>I… Hmm. It'd look weird.</i>

33:07.920 --> 33:09.840
What's wrong with two women dancing?

33:11.760 --> 33:12.840
I'll tell you what.

33:14.080 --> 33:15.400
<i>One dance.</i>

33:16.240 --> 33:18.520
<i>And then we're done for the night.</i>

33:18.600 --> 33:20.840
My friend,
she's here with the white lady.

33:21.480 --> 33:23.080
You need to get here.

33:23.160 --> 33:24.160
Get here now!

34:25.680 --> 34:27.800
Tshepo, wait.

34:27.880 --> 34:29.280
Hey! Stop it.

34:29.360 --> 34:31.720
Piss off with your bullshit!

34:31.800 --> 34:33.280
Where are your people?

34:33.880 --> 34:36.280
Why you making this
about your people and my people

34:36.360 --> 34:37.920
when it's just the two of us here?

34:38.000 --> 34:39.800
What, you're not man enough

34:40.400 --> 34:41.880
for just you and me?

34:43.840 --> 34:45.440
You are nothing to me.

34:46.040 --> 34:47.280
Ah.

34:47.360 --> 34:48.520
Really?

34:48.600 --> 34:50.880
So then why are you being all macho

34:50.960 --> 34:53.640
in front of your girlfriend
and all these wonderful people?

34:53.720 --> 34:54.720
These are my people.

34:55.400 --> 34:56.240
Ah.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.080
That's where the rub sits, isn't it?

34:59.800 --> 35:01.680
This is payback time for you.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.520
So you're picking on me

35:03.600 --> 35:06.800
so that you can have revenge
for what my people did to you.

35:08.720 --> 35:11.680
Okay. I suppose,
if that's what satisfies you,

35:11.760 --> 35:13.840
you can fucking go ahead.

35:13.920 --> 35:17.680
Listen, Tshepo, listen. Wait.

35:17.760 --> 35:19.160
We are just dancing.

35:19.240 --> 35:20.720
Just having some fun.

35:20.800 --> 35:22.240
This party is over.

35:24.560 --> 35:27.400
-Siya. Siya!
-Hey. Hey.

35:30.960 --> 35:32.080
You wanna dance?

35:32.160 --> 35:33.040
Fuck off.

35:34.120 --> 35:35.440
You fuck off.

36:00.200 --> 36:02.640
-It's enough.

36:02.720 --> 36:05.920
No, no. I want to have
beautiful memories of you when I'm gone.

36:06.000 --> 36:08.240
-You've got enough.
-One time. Just let me take--

36:08.320 --> 36:09.480
Ah, ah, ah. Uh-uh.

36:09.560 --> 36:11.240
Oh! I've had enough.

36:13.760 --> 36:14.800
Mmm.

36:20.080 --> 36:21.400
Did he hurt you?

36:22.200 --> 36:24.320
Mm-mm. He wouldn't do that to me.

36:26.800 --> 36:29.000
Have you given the offer some thought?

36:30.520 --> 36:31.720
What offer, Grandma?

36:31.800 --> 36:36.800
I told your grandmother
that you could be a model in Cape Town.

36:39.720 --> 36:41.840
So that's what this is all about.

36:43.240 --> 36:44.240
No.

36:45.800 --> 36:47.680
It doesn't matter.

36:47.760 --> 36:51.440
What matters is what you say.

36:52.120 --> 36:54.120
I can't go and leave you here.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.200
Why not?

36:57.040 --> 37:02.240
She told me there's more
opportunities there than here.

37:02.320 --> 37:03.680
No, Grandma.

37:05.760 --> 37:07.960
Okay, make me understand.

37:09.960 --> 37:11.200
No, Grandma.

37:12.440 --> 37:16.200
My child, I said make me understand.

37:17.120 --> 37:19.760
Maybe we should
let Siya decide for herself.

37:20.600 --> 37:21.800
Stay out of this.

37:23.960 --> 37:28.360
Grandma, stop trying
to convince me to leave you.

37:28.440 --> 37:29.880
I will never do that.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.800
I never asked you to stay.

37:52.640 --> 37:54.000
Give her time.

37:54.080 --> 37:54.920
Time…

37:56.200 --> 37:59.000
Yeah. That thing.

38:26.880 --> 38:27.720
Yes.

38:28.440 --> 38:30.280
Hey, whitey.

38:31.880 --> 38:33.400
What, you want to run?

38:34.560 --> 38:36.600
Go ahead, run.

38:36.680 --> 38:38.560
-You know what she wants, boy?
-What?

38:38.640 --> 38:41.040
She wants to swim. Let's dunk her.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.720
You want to swim, huh?

38:43.480 --> 38:44.360
Huh.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.920
I see you have plans for my girl.

38:47.960 --> 38:49.560
What, you wanna fuck her with this?

38:49.640 --> 38:51.040
-Is this your dick? Huh?
-No!

38:51.560 --> 38:54.160
I just wanted to help her.
I just wanted to help her.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.120
Help her with what?

38:57.200 --> 38:59.880
It doesn't matter.
She doesn't need my help, so we're done.

38:59.960 --> 39:01.040
We're done.

39:01.120 --> 39:02.200
Hey, brother.

39:03.120 --> 39:04.240
What are we waiting for?

39:04.320 --> 39:06.680
Why don't we
just do what we came here to do?

39:07.320 --> 39:08.800
But you can see her.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.560
-See what?
-She's just a whitey.

39:10.640 --> 39:11.920
She is scared.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.840
-You thinking straight?
-You know I don't hurt women, right?

39:14.920 --> 39:16.400
I think you're losing it.

39:16.480 --> 39:18.600
Just because I won't do anything

39:18.680 --> 39:20.840
doesn't mean you shouldn't.

39:22.920 --> 39:24.240
You…

39:24.320 --> 39:25.800
be all over her, my friend.

39:31.240 --> 39:33.240
-Hi.
-Hey.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.200
How are you doing?

39:34.280 --> 39:35.440
I'm not great.

40:25.600 --> 40:28.560
There we go. Come here.

41:47.400 --> 41:48.400
You?

41:49.120 --> 41:50.920
Don't worry, you're safe now.

41:51.520 --> 41:53.800
Ugh. What is that smell?

41:54.520 --> 41:55.840
Good Lord…

41:55.920 --> 41:56.960
am I in hell?

41:57.040 --> 41:59.160
You're asking
too many questions, my child.

41:59.240 --> 42:01.200
Just sit down and calm down.

42:01.640 --> 42:02.680
I know you.

42:02.760 --> 42:04.880
You were at the memorial.
You were praying.

42:04.960 --> 42:06.360
More like cleansing.

42:08.160 --> 42:09.360
How long have I been here?

42:09.440 --> 42:11.440
Have a rest, please. Rest.

42:11.520 --> 42:13.600
No. I must go.

42:13.680 --> 42:15.680
Where? Where are you going, huh?

42:15.760 --> 42:17.160
Where are my clothes?

42:17.240 --> 42:20.600
-Where are my clothes?
-Do you even know who you are?

42:23.680 --> 42:25.200
Yes, I know who I am.

42:26.880 --> 42:29.240
Okay, relax. Relax.

42:31.080 --> 42:33.240
-Calm down. Calm down.

42:33.320 --> 42:34.720
Relax.

42:34.800 --> 42:36.600
What the fuck?

42:37.680 --> 42:38.880
Relax.

42:52.960 --> 42:54.680
Imagine you modeling.

42:55.320 --> 42:57.440
Hmm. Being all serious.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.240
She is crazy. She just wanted to use me.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.280
That's how white people are.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.440
All they do is use people.

43:06.200 --> 43:07.760
Yeah, but I saw you.

43:07.840 --> 43:09.000
You were rattled.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.000
-Me?
-Yes.

43:11.680 --> 43:13.040
Maybe a little.

43:14.240 --> 43:16.040
You embarrassed me.

43:18.160 --> 43:19.320
Okay.

43:19.400 --> 43:21.480
What I did was idiotic.

43:21.560 --> 43:22.880
Idiotic?

43:23.800 --> 43:25.120
I'm an idiot.

43:27.200 --> 43:28.440
Your idiot.

43:28.520 --> 43:29.920
-Hmm?
-Hmm.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.440
Your idiot.

43:31.560 --> 43:33.600
Hmm?

43:33.680 --> 43:34.760
Mm.

43:52.800 --> 43:53.640
Now.

43:57.400 --> 43:58.440
Tshepo, get off.

44:03.760 --> 44:05.360
Where did you get this bag?

44:07.680 --> 44:11.200
Uh… The guys found it and sold it to me.

44:13.360 --> 44:15.000
No, this is Tyra's bag.

44:15.080 --> 44:17.960
Rubbish. There's lots of bags
like these around the township.

44:18.680 --> 44:19.640
Goodness…

44:22.080 --> 44:23.480
Tshepo, what did you do?

44:47.240 --> 44:49.080
They're not gonna get away with it.

44:49.800 --> 44:52.720
Fucking bastard and his goon,
I'm going to get them.

44:53.760 --> 44:56.480
When I'm done with them,
they're going to rot in hell.

44:57.840 --> 44:58.720
Drink.

44:59.880 --> 45:01.680
Mm-mm. It's pink.

45:01.760 --> 45:02.960
Drink.

45:14.560 --> 45:16.600
Can't. It's too sweet.

45:17.280 --> 45:19.240
It's not going to do you much good.

45:20.840 --> 45:22.240
What are you talking about?

45:24.480 --> 45:25.560
Drink.

45:27.000 --> 45:27.840
Uh-uh.

45:27.920 --> 45:29.760
-Drink.
-I…

45:29.840 --> 45:31.080
Drink!

45:42.000 --> 45:43.200
Ah!

45:45.680 --> 45:48.880
Where are my clothes?
Where are my clothes?

46:07.960 --> 46:09.440
So, <i>bonjour, </i>everybody.

46:09.520 --> 46:13.680
You are in the hands of
one of the best tour guides in this town.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.240
What do you want, busybody?

46:15.320 --> 46:16.360
So sorry.

46:16.440 --> 46:18.080
I'm looking for the white woman.

46:18.160 --> 46:20.520
Here are the white people.
We are with them.

46:21.080 --> 46:23.840
No, the woman
who always has a camera. Tyra.

46:23.920 --> 46:25.480
Ah. Miss Know-It-All.

46:25.560 --> 46:29.880
She's the one who's been
telling people that my tours are boring.

46:31.120 --> 46:32.040
I don't know.

46:32.600 --> 46:34.000
The last time I saw her

46:34.080 --> 46:36.680
they told me somebody from here
is showing her around.

46:36.760 --> 46:41.600
Yes, I was supposed to do that,
but now I can't find her.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.080
Oh.

46:44.840 --> 46:48.720
So you're the one
taking food from my table? Huh?

46:50.240 --> 46:53.560
Are you a tour guide?
Are you a Sharpeville-ologist?

46:53.640 --> 46:55.720
-Are you accredited?
-No…

46:55.800 --> 46:58.320
What do you know about this place? Huh?

46:59.360 --> 47:00.960
You know what?

47:01.040 --> 47:03.720
Go. Go, get out of here!

47:03.800 --> 47:08.160
Go before I slap you
and they accuse me of GDV.

47:13.120 --> 47:15.080
So, as I was saying, by George,

47:15.720 --> 47:17.920
we're going to continue our thing…

47:26.560 --> 47:28.360
What are you doing up?

47:28.440 --> 47:29.760
What do you want?

47:29.840 --> 47:31.440
You're too weak to be here.

47:31.520 --> 47:33.240
I've got to get back.

47:33.320 --> 47:35.040
Please, you have to help me get back.

47:35.120 --> 47:37.400
People want to go forward and you…

47:37.960 --> 47:39.240
you want to go back?

47:39.320 --> 47:41.480
Oh, Mama, where else do I go?

47:42.080 --> 47:43.880
Where were you before you came here?

47:44.360 --> 47:46.760
I just remember falling into the river.

47:47.520 --> 47:48.640
Drowning.

47:52.640 --> 47:54.360
Thank you for saving me, Mam' Zikode.

47:54.440 --> 47:58.240
No, no, no, I didn't save you.
The river coughed you out.

47:59.920 --> 48:01.120
I'm not surprised.

48:01.680 --> 48:04.120
Most of the men in my life
did the same thing.

48:10.400 --> 48:11.680
Are you praying?

48:11.760 --> 48:13.400
Huh? No. Um…

48:13.480 --> 48:14.680
Just getting supper.

48:31.600 --> 48:32.800
Grandma.

48:36.280 --> 48:38.520
Grandma. Oh my God.

48:48.120 --> 48:52.520
Grandma, see why I can't leave you?

48:53.040 --> 48:57.360
I just took a nap.
I knew you'd come wake me up.

49:00.120 --> 49:02.320
You took too long though.

49:02.400 --> 49:03.840
I'm sorry, Grandma.

49:06.720 --> 49:08.600
I was busy looking for Tyra.

49:08.680 --> 49:11.360
I fear something bad
may have happened to her.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.800
What makes you say that?

49:12.880 --> 49:14.040
I can't find her.

49:15.360 --> 49:16.360
Go and look for her.

49:16.440 --> 49:17.520
How, Grandma?

49:18.680 --> 49:19.960
Or maybe she left.

49:20.040 --> 49:22.880
No, I went to check
at the lodge she's staying at

49:22.960 --> 49:24.280
and she didn't check out.

49:25.280 --> 49:28.080
Go and look for her or else I will.

49:28.160 --> 49:30.640
No, Grandma,
you are in no state to do that.

49:33.000 --> 49:38.400
Why don't you ask Tshepo to send
his boys to go and search for her?

49:39.760 --> 49:43.760
I suspect
he's behind Tyra's disappearance.

49:49.800 --> 49:50.920
What makes you say that?

49:55.200 --> 49:56.240
He did something.

50:02.920 --> 50:05.920
You know what, my child?
If I ever went missing,

50:06.000 --> 50:09.080
I would want you
to search until you found me.

50:09.800 --> 50:12.280
Grandma, I don't even know
if she's still alive or not.

50:15.600 --> 50:20.240
Deep down, what do you feel?

50:29.240 --> 50:30.480
Go and look for her.

50:32.560 --> 50:34.680
So, my girl,

50:34.760 --> 50:36.160
I am a prophet.

50:36.240 --> 50:37.640
A prophet.

50:37.720 --> 50:41.480
Yes, I heal people with prayer and water.

50:41.560 --> 50:44.000
Well, painkillers would've done the trick.

50:44.080 --> 50:46.320
I would've been out of here in no time.

50:46.400 --> 50:50.680
Maybe the pain you have is not the type
that can be fixed by painkillers.

50:51.920 --> 50:55.000
Yeah, that's putting it mildly.

50:57.960 --> 51:00.000
The young girl, is she your daughter?

51:01.360 --> 51:03.440
So, you knew she was coming, right?

51:06.200 --> 51:07.440
I wasn't sure.

51:07.520 --> 51:08.880
Don't lie!

51:13.040 --> 51:14.160
I'm sorry.

51:15.160 --> 51:17.840
I'm sorry. I know that you're afraid.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.600
Hmm?

54:28.480 --> 54:29.800
-Brother?
-Yes?

54:31.120 --> 54:32.680
What did you find there?

54:32.760 --> 54:35.000
There is a book
with the names of all the cops

54:35.080 --> 54:37.040
that were involved in our discrimination.

54:37.120 --> 54:38.600
Guess whose name is there?

54:38.680 --> 54:39.720
Who?

54:39.800 --> 54:42.440
My father's first post
was here in Sharpeville.

54:43.200 --> 54:44.280
It was 20 years ago.

54:44.360 --> 54:45.480
Black.

54:46.160 --> 54:48.280
And they did bad things. Really bad.

54:57.280 --> 54:58.320
The massacre.

55:00.000 --> 55:04.440
He always gloated about it.
He never once felt any remorse.

55:04.520 --> 55:05.960
So what's the plan?

55:06.040 --> 55:07.320
I need to tell Siya.

55:07.400 --> 55:08.320
Let's do this.

55:08.400 --> 55:09.840
Let's do this, brother.

55:11.040 --> 55:15.560
So he masked his pain with
a lie, so he can be able to live with it.

55:15.640 --> 55:16.880
To help him sleep.

55:16.960 --> 55:19.560
Sleep? He screamed in his sleep.

55:19.640 --> 55:22.200
Screamed all the time with nightmares.

55:23.000 --> 55:24.560
And then the nightmare killed him.

55:27.520 --> 55:30.720
It was a month ago. That's when I knew.

55:38.240 --> 55:40.440
You didn't come here to take pictures.

55:40.520 --> 55:41.680
Uh…

55:42.440 --> 55:44.520
I…

55:45.640 --> 55:48.960
Nothing made sense until I saw her.

55:53.560 --> 55:54.600
Saw who?

56:01.200 --> 56:02.120
Her.

56:30.320 --> 56:31.840
How did you find me?

56:32.600 --> 56:33.680
The river.

56:34.400 --> 56:37.080
You know how crazy that sounds, right?

56:38.880 --> 56:40.560
Mam' Zikode saved me.

56:40.640 --> 56:43.760
No, I told you I didn't save you.

56:43.840 --> 56:47.000
The river coughed you out
because you don't belong here.

56:48.960 --> 56:50.640
And she's a bit messed up too.

56:56.640 --> 56:57.560
Ah…

56:58.200 --> 57:01.000
It looks like I'm going
to need more fish today. So…

57:01.640 --> 57:02.840
let me go.

57:55.000 --> 57:56.080
Hey, Siya!

57:59.760 --> 58:01.920
Oh, Grandmother.

58:02.800 --> 58:03.960
Tshepo.

58:04.920 --> 58:07.120
I am looking for Siya.

58:08.120 --> 58:10.920
I can't find her.
Do you know where she might be?

58:11.000 --> 58:12.680
She went to the river.

58:14.160 --> 58:16.440
What's wrong?
What is she doing at the river?

58:18.160 --> 58:20.560
She went to fix what you messed up.

58:29.760 --> 58:31.360
Tell me, Grandmother…

58:33.200 --> 58:34.840
what did I do?

58:35.720 --> 58:37.200
What you always do.

58:38.640 --> 58:40.400
The good thing is…

58:41.880 --> 58:43.960
what goes around comes around, my boy.

58:45.080 --> 58:47.600
The truth always comes out at the end.

58:55.200 --> 58:56.560
So you think…

59:02.840 --> 59:07.560
I should be arrested
for injuring one white person?

59:10.360 --> 59:14.080
Yet not even one white person was punished
for the merciless deaths of our people.

59:17.680 --> 59:19.160
Does that seem fair to you?

59:21.240 --> 59:23.920
Tell that to the police
when they arrest you.

59:32.280 --> 59:34.120
You know, Grandma, the truth is…

59:34.200 --> 59:35.880
I need someone with strength.

59:35.960 --> 59:37.400
Someone like myself and Muzi

59:37.480 --> 59:39.640
and not a sickly person like you.

59:40.960 --> 59:43.840
It's because of people like you

59:45.240 --> 59:51.200
that we will never
overcome this dark cloud.

59:57.280 --> 59:58.840
People like me?

59:59.480 --> 1:00:01.080
Am I the one who killed our people?

1:00:02.560 --> 1:00:03.720
Who killed them like goats?

1:00:06.280 --> 1:00:08.720
Am I the one who is
denying our people justice?

1:00:09.840 --> 1:00:12.360
These people come here every day

1:00:13.040 --> 1:00:14.360
to gloat.

1:00:15.920 --> 1:00:19.640
To show us we agreed to remain fools,
to be violated by them.

1:00:22.560 --> 1:00:25.840
The white lady you care about so much
is exactly like them.

1:00:29.080 --> 1:00:30.080
No…

1:00:30.760 --> 1:00:33.360
There's something else
I discovered about your white lady.

1:00:33.440 --> 1:00:35.640
It's clear she is the worst of them all.

1:00:35.720 --> 1:00:39.440
I hope she and her family burn in hell.

1:00:42.480 --> 1:00:44.720
I hear your pain.

1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:14.120
The thing about pain…

1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:18.880
is that it's taken away by one thing.

1:01:19.680 --> 1:01:21.440
It's taken away by death.

1:01:43.240 --> 1:01:45.040
-No, brother. Wait…
-Hey!

1:01:49.280 --> 1:01:50.240
Ah…

1:02:36.360 --> 1:02:37.600
Tshepo, my brother.

1:03:06.280 --> 1:03:07.480
Tshepo.

1:03:07.560 --> 1:03:10.000
-Tshepo, what did you do?
-Do you want to go to jail?

1:03:10.080 --> 1:03:11.160
You want to go to jail?

1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:12.720
Man up, for goodness sake.

1:03:19.280 --> 1:03:20.760
You need to go.

1:03:23.040 --> 1:03:25.560
You have to go back to Cape Town.
You are not safe here.

1:03:27.440 --> 1:03:28.360
Come with me.

1:03:28.440 --> 1:03:29.760
You know I can't.

1:03:29.840 --> 1:03:31.400
We'll take your granny with us.

1:03:32.760 --> 1:03:34.680
I don't see that happening.

1:03:36.520 --> 1:03:38.600
Sharpeville is all my grandmother knows.

1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:41.280
My grandfather…

1:03:41.840 --> 1:03:44.000
her husband,
he was also killed in the massacre.

1:03:45.680 --> 1:03:47.880
Our lives revolve around insulin,

1:03:49.360 --> 1:03:52.000
going to the hospital,
and my grandfather's grave.

1:03:54.680 --> 1:03:56.760
Doesn't sound like much of a life.

1:03:58.000 --> 1:03:59.640
Like your life is perfect?

1:04:01.160 --> 1:04:03.080
Maybe it's not what is in one's life,

1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:04.760
but who's in it.

1:04:10.560 --> 1:04:12.320
You can't leave me alone, can you?

1:04:12.400 --> 1:04:13.920
Neither can you, Siya…

1:04:14.600 --> 1:04:15.960
leave me alone.

1:04:17.520 --> 1:04:21.760
Evil spirits are hovering.
Evil spirits are hovering, Father.

1:04:21.840 --> 1:04:24.760
<i>You're the one who knows it all,</i>
<i>Jehovah my Lord.</i>

1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:44.280
Before you came,
everything was clear in my life.

1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:48.640
It wasn't much, but at least it was clear.

1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:51.280
Now nothing makes sense.

1:05:00.160 --> 1:05:01.360
I'm sorry.

1:05:30.200 --> 1:05:31.480
Hey, Siya!

1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:34.680
Tshepo. We have to go.

1:05:34.760 --> 1:05:37.680
No. Fuck that. I'm done running.

1:05:43.280 --> 1:05:44.520
Man, Tshepo…

1:05:44.600 --> 1:05:46.880
-Let's talk.
-What bullshit is this?

1:05:46.960 --> 1:05:49.200
-Piss off.
-Whoa, whoa, wait.

1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:50.640
What are you doing here?

1:05:50.720 --> 1:05:52.200
Tshepo, please let this go.

1:05:52.280 --> 1:05:53.120
Let it go?

1:05:53.200 --> 1:05:56.640
I'm not going back. I'm going
to finish this rubbish once and for all.

1:05:56.720 --> 1:05:58.320
Please, Tshepo. Tshepo.

1:05:58.400 --> 1:06:01.080
What happened between
you and Tyra doesn't matter anymore.

1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:02.640
Tyra will forget everything.

1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:05.280
She'll forget it.
Everything will go back to normal.

1:06:05.360 --> 1:06:07.400
Forgetting?
Do you know white people?

1:06:07.480 --> 1:06:09.840
You hurt her a little bit,
she tells the whole world.

1:06:09.920 --> 1:06:11.080
But when they hurt us…

1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:13.160
It's a whole fucking different story.

1:06:13.240 --> 1:06:15.640
I'm telling you she won't speak.
I'm telling you.

1:06:15.720 --> 1:06:17.400
Tyra, tell him you won't tell.

1:06:17.480 --> 1:06:20.080
Run, Siya. You go.
Once he kills me, he's going to kill you.

1:06:20.160 --> 1:06:22.320
No. No one is killing anyone.

1:06:22.400 --> 1:06:23.960
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

1:06:24.040 --> 1:06:26.200
You came for revenge, well, here it is.

1:06:26.280 --> 1:06:27.400
Open your eyes.

1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:31.480
Her father…

1:06:32.680 --> 1:06:34.160
was one of the cops

1:06:34.240 --> 1:06:35.760
that killed our people.

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:38.240
Is that true?

1:06:42.800 --> 1:06:43.840
Yes.

1:06:44.960 --> 1:06:46.440
What did you come here for?

1:06:47.480 --> 1:06:50.400
I don't know. I don't know.

1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:52.680
-Siya, I don't know.
-Am I your penance?

1:06:52.760 --> 1:06:55.360
Maybe. Maybe you are. Maybe not.

1:06:55.440 --> 1:06:57.320
All I know is that I love you,

1:06:57.400 --> 1:07:00.640
and I've loved you
long before I saw the river.

1:07:00.720 --> 1:07:02.480
Love! Bullshit!

1:07:02.560 --> 1:07:05.120
Bullshit! She's here
to finish what her father started.

1:07:05.200 --> 1:07:06.560
Or pay for it, right?

1:07:07.320 --> 1:07:08.440
Yeah. You're right.

1:07:08.520 --> 1:07:10.200
You'll pay for it. Definitely pay for it.

1:07:10.280 --> 1:07:11.840
Tshepo, I am begging you.

1:07:11.920 --> 1:07:14.040
You're definitely going to pay for it.

1:07:14.120 --> 1:07:16.840
-I am begging you, Tshepo!
-Hold her!

1:07:19.120 --> 1:07:20.840
Tshepo, you are hurting her!

1:07:20.920 --> 1:07:22.360
Let her go!

1:07:23.920 --> 1:07:27.120
We are fighting against
neither flesh nor blood.

1:07:27.200 --> 1:07:29.320
We exalt you, Lord!

1:07:46.200 --> 1:07:47.120
What the…

1:07:49.480 --> 1:07:54.760
We praise you, Father!
Enter Holy Spirit! Enter Holy Spirit!

1:07:57.240 --> 1:07:59.560
Tshepo, what did you do to her?

1:07:59.640 --> 1:08:01.360
What did you do to her?

1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:05.040
Yeah. Yeah.

1:08:05.920 --> 1:08:07.840
Our people can
finally rest in peace.

1:08:11.840 --> 1:08:15.400
And heal as
the spirit of Satan lurks, my God.

1:08:15.480 --> 1:08:16.920
Where did you get that?

1:08:17.000 --> 1:08:18.440
It's your granny's.

1:08:18.520 --> 1:08:20.240
-She doesn't need it anymore.

1:08:20.320 --> 1:08:23.120
Tshepo, what did you do to my grandmother?

1:08:23.200 --> 1:08:25.680
What did you do to my grandmother?

1:08:25.760 --> 1:08:27.720
You killed my grandmother!

1:08:30.840 --> 1:08:32.040
Hallelujah.

1:08:32.120 --> 1:08:33.440
Leave me alone!

1:08:47.640 --> 1:08:48.760
Tshepo!

1:08:54.320 --> 1:08:57.880
<i>Hey! Ha!</i>

1:09:01.440 --> 1:09:04.800
Remove the devil's work!

1:09:05.800 --> 1:09:07.280
Let me go.

1:09:24.800 --> 1:09:26.600
<i>Hallelujah.</i>

1:09:42.760 --> 1:09:44.000
Get away from me.

1:09:48.680 --> 1:09:50.280
I'm sorry, my love.

1:09:53.560 --> 1:09:55.440
I'm sorry, okay?

1:09:58.400 --> 1:09:59.880
Tyra was mine.

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:03.680
What you did…

1:10:05.040 --> 1:10:07.760
you took away my past and my future.

1:10:15.640 --> 1:10:17.520
-You forced my hand.
-No.

1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:25.040
Your actions have cursed us.

1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:29.320
I know you've always wanted to do this.

1:10:31.960 --> 1:10:34.640
Now you will live
your whole life on the run.

1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:48.680
Siya, Siya, Siya, Siya. Siya.

1:10:51.000 --> 1:10:52.040
Siya.

1:10:52.880 --> 1:10:55.400
Siya. Siya!

1:10:56.720 --> 1:11:00.480
Tshepo. What will we do with Siya?
You know she will tell people.

1:11:01.680 --> 1:11:02.880
Tshepo?

1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:06.640
I know.

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:08.440
So, are you letting her go?

1:11:11.080 --> 1:11:12.680
I don't know, my brother.

1:11:14.040 --> 1:11:15.960
I'm tired of Siya.
I'm tired of this place.

1:11:16.040 --> 1:11:17.280
I am just tired.

1:11:25.480 --> 1:11:27.240
So, what are we going to do?

1:11:31.560 --> 1:11:32.600
We will run away.

1:11:41.080 --> 1:11:42.440
We will run away.

1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:44.920
Until when?

1:11:51.040 --> 1:11:52.240
Forever.

1:13:12.600 --> 1:13:14.400
Yes, my girl.

1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.040
Tyra is now one…

1:13:20.880 --> 1:13:22.840
with the river and with time.

1:13:27.080 --> 1:13:28.960
I want the river to spit her out.

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:31.520
Let it release her again.

1:13:35.680 --> 1:13:37.720
The river coughed her out because…

1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.760
her spirit was wandering aimlessly,

1:13:43.320 --> 1:13:45.000
unable to pass…

1:13:46.720 --> 1:13:49.720
because she lost something very important…

1:13:51.240 --> 1:13:52.800
on the day of the massacre.

1:13:54.240 --> 1:13:59.120
She found what she had lost
when she found you.

1:14:00.720 --> 1:14:03.400
Her spirit is no longer roaming.

1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:06.600
She isn't on the run anymore.

1:14:08.600 --> 1:14:10.600
Running from what?

1:14:12.280 --> 1:14:14.160
She wasn't running from anything.

1:14:15.160 --> 1:14:18.800
She ran in order to free herself
from the body that you once lived in.

1:14:21.680 --> 1:14:23.360
In order to protect you.

1:14:31.520 --> 1:14:32.720
Was I there?

1:14:37.880 --> 1:14:39.320
We were all there.

1:14:44.720 --> 1:14:45.920
Even Tshepo?

1:14:48.360 --> 1:14:53.160
Tshepo will be killed
by a dream, my child.

1:14:54.200 --> 1:14:56.280
An excruciating dream…

1:14:59.320 --> 1:15:01.840
but like I said before,

1:15:03.360 --> 1:15:07.400
Tyra is now one with the river and time.

1:15:12.440 --> 1:15:13.720
Don't cry.

1:15:14.920 --> 1:15:16.400
Don't cry, my child.

1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:21.400
She will come back and find you.
