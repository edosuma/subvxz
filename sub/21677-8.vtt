WEBVTT

00:12.375 --> 00:12.917
- Previously on "Below Deck"...

00:15.375 --> 00:17.375
- Okay.
Yeah, that'd be cool.

00:17.375 --> 00:19.042
What are you sending
money home for?

00:19.042 --> 00:20.500
- My daughter.
- Oh.

00:20.500 --> 00:21.625
- Yeah.

00:21.625 --> 00:22.708
- I didn't know
you had one.

00:22.708 --> 00:23.833
- Didn't you?
- Mm-mm.

00:23.833 --> 00:25.667
It's kind of a red flag.

00:27.333 --> 00:29.292
- It's been five months
of no sex.

00:31.708 --> 00:33.333
- I'm gonna sweep her
off her feet,

00:33.333 --> 00:35.125
and she's not gonna know
what f---ing hit her.

00:35.125 --> 00:36.792
- Kyle and Sierra, they're going
fishing and for dinner.

00:36.792 --> 00:38.333
- We're going.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.375
- They want a themed
dance party on the yacht,

00:43.375 --> 00:46.375
and Steve wants to surprise
Rachel by proposing.

00:46.375 --> 00:48.250
- Rachel--
let me get on my right--

00:48.250 --> 00:50.083
- Yes!

00:50.083 --> 00:52.083
- Will you marry me?
- Yes! Yes!

00:52.083 --> 00:54.750
- I have a flower order coming.
Do you want me to add to it?

00:54.750 --> 00:56.875
- I would like that.

00:58.042 --> 00:59.750
I would like
to take you for dinner.

00:59.750 --> 01:01.500
- What's she saying?
- I would love to.

01:01.500 --> 01:03.167
- That's very good.

01:03.167 --> 01:05.042
- Kelley's like,
"Maybe if we, like,

01:05.042 --> 01:07.083
"ram the tender into the pool
and push it out the way,

01:07.083 --> 01:08.750
it'll happen,"
but every time he pulled back,

01:08.750 --> 01:10.333
the pool just quickly swung in.

01:10.333 --> 01:11.708
- What are you doing?

01:11.708 --> 01:13.000
- Go ahead,
back out of there, Kelley,

01:13.000 --> 01:14.417
as soon as she gets it loose.

01:14.417 --> 01:15.583
- Guests are standing there
watching us,

01:15.583 --> 01:17.208
and we're like, "Ugh."

01:17.208 --> 01:19.250
- Jesus Christ, he could f--- up
a two-car funeral.

01:19.250 --> 01:20.917
- Are you guys leaving me?
- Oops.

01:20.917 --> 01:23.417
- It's f---in' embarrassing.

01:43.042 --> 01:44.250
It's 7:40.

01:48.958 --> 01:50.625
- Ooh, it looks even better
in the daylight.

01:50.625 --> 01:51.958
Go like...
- Really?

01:51.958 --> 01:53.250
- Yeah.
- It's so bourgie.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.458
- That's how they do it.

01:55.917 --> 01:58.417
♪ Love is in the air ♪

01:58.417 --> 02:01.292
I feel it.
I feel it. I feel it.

02:01.292 --> 02:03.042
Yep, that's
definitely love.

02:03.042 --> 02:05.375
We all know Ben.

02:05.375 --> 02:07.292
He's usually pretty popular
with the ladies.

02:07.292 --> 02:09.458
- Can this be our Christmas card
next year?

02:11.583 --> 02:12.625
Do you like salmon?

02:12.625 --> 02:14.167
- I love salmon.

02:15.667 --> 02:17.667
I love you, Ben.

02:19.500 --> 02:23.750
- But I've never seen Ben
this way around any girl.

02:23.750 --> 02:26.583
He seems nervous,
and it's really cute.

02:26.583 --> 02:28.083
- Don't you guys
have a job?

02:30.167 --> 02:31.750
- Kelley, Kelley, Lee.

02:31.750 --> 02:33.500
- Go for Kelley.
- To the bridge, please, sir.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.000
- Yes, sir. En route.

02:41.333 --> 02:44.167
What's going on, Captain?

02:44.167 --> 02:47.625
- I wanted to chat with you
about yesterday.

02:47.625 --> 02:49.667
We had the guests
on the aft deck,

02:49.667 --> 02:51.583
and that fiasco with the pool

02:51.583 --> 02:53.875
was just a total embarrassment.

02:53.875 --> 02:57.167
I know you felt it, because I
could see it by looking at you.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.792
He's in charge
of the exterior.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.333
He's in charge
of water activities.

03:00.333 --> 03:02.000
He's in charge
of guest satisfaction

03:02.000 --> 03:03.792
outside the interior.

03:03.792 --> 03:05.292
I mean, it's not rocket science.

03:05.292 --> 03:10.042
Your crew,
they're looking to you

03:10.042 --> 03:11.875
for guidance and direction.

03:11.875 --> 03:13.708
You're not always gonna be able
to be their friend,

03:13.708 --> 03:15.500
and you're gonna have
to get their attention

03:15.500 --> 03:18.500
and say, "Listen, no, don't do
what you think is right.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.625
Do what I tell you to do."

03:20.625 --> 03:23.833
- I am trying to take everything
Captain Lee is teaching me

03:23.833 --> 03:26.875
as constructive criticism,
instead of getting defensive

03:26.875 --> 03:28.542
or anything like that.

03:28.542 --> 03:31.375
But at the same time,
it's too much at times.

03:31.375 --> 03:32.667
- When you're out in the ocean,

03:32.667 --> 03:34.125
you don't always have the luxury

03:34.125 --> 03:35.583
of being nice about things.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.208
You need it done,
and you need it done now,

03:37.208 --> 03:39.750
because 30 seconds from now
is too goddamn late.

03:39.750 --> 03:41.750
- Fair enough.
- All right, pal.

03:41.750 --> 03:43.167
- Thanks, Captain.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.250
All right, ready with that.

03:59.250 --> 04:00.583
Thank you.

04:00.583 --> 04:02.000
- It's French toast.
- What?

04:02.000 --> 04:05.708
- How cute.
- Look at that.

04:05.708 --> 04:08.000
- Oh, my God.
That bacon's good, too.

04:08.000 --> 04:10.083
- Mm-hmm.

04:10.083 --> 04:12.708
- Okay, if you want
to stay here in the galley,

04:12.708 --> 04:14.333
I'm gonna go around
and check the rooms...

04:14.333 --> 04:15.583
- Okay.
- And start planning

04:15.583 --> 04:18.625
the dance party.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.792
- How are you?
Where has the morning gone?

04:20.792 --> 04:23.292
It just whizzed past.

04:23.292 --> 04:24.708
Hasn't it?

04:24.708 --> 04:28.083
- One thing leads into another.

04:28.083 --> 04:30.042
Did you catch up on sleep?

04:30.042 --> 04:31.625
- Yes, I had
a really good sleep.

04:31.625 --> 04:33.292
- Good.

04:33.292 --> 04:34.458
- I'm seeing Ben
in a different light

04:34.458 --> 04:36.750
and not with a big bravado

04:36.750 --> 04:40.875
and confidence and being
very cheeky and witty.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.958
I'm suddenly seeing
a very sweet side to him.

04:43.958 --> 04:45.958
It's thrown me.

04:45.958 --> 04:48.792
- I just don't think I'm very
good at sleeping, to be honest.

04:48.792 --> 04:51.458
- I always have a kind
of mild tea before bed.

04:51.458 --> 04:53.042
- I should probably take
some kind of sedative

04:53.042 --> 04:54.250
immediately after service.

04:54.250 --> 04:55.958
Yeah.

04:55.958 --> 04:58.792
- Deck crew, deck crew,
let's put the slide out.

04:58.792 --> 05:01.958
- Three, two, one.

05:04.833 --> 05:06.625
- Wow.

05:09.792 --> 05:11.458
- After yesterday,

05:11.458 --> 05:13.167
I think Lee's just got it out
for the deck crew.

05:13.167 --> 05:14.792
- How are the lines
looking up there?

05:14.792 --> 05:16.583
- There's no tension
on 'em right now.

05:16.583 --> 05:18.500
- All right, tighten 'em up
where there is tension.

05:18.500 --> 05:21.250
- He's just watching us
and being like a hawk.

05:22.833 --> 05:24.000
- I'm gonna miss Frankie.

05:24.000 --> 05:25.500
- You are?
- He is so cute.

05:25.500 --> 05:28.333
- No.
He's so not your type.

05:28.333 --> 05:30.000
He reminds me of Turtle
from "Entourage."

05:30.000 --> 05:31.250
- Yeah, he does.

05:31.250 --> 05:33.000
- So what about you
and Kyle?

05:33.000 --> 05:35.125
- I don't think he wants it
to be a group thing.

05:35.125 --> 05:36.917
Can they come?
- Why don't you guys go?

05:36.917 --> 05:39.292
All three of you go,
have a f---ing triple date.

05:39.292 --> 05:40.625
- Because, you know,
you kind of have

05:40.625 --> 05:41.833
somebody on land
that you're into.

05:41.833 --> 05:43.708
- No, I was
gonna tell him.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.542
I'm currently single,
but I met a guy

05:45.542 --> 05:47.833
before I came on this boat;
he's not my boyfriend.

05:52.042 --> 05:55.167
If a guy texts you on
Valentine's Day, he's into you.

05:55.167 --> 05:56.792
I just want to, like,
go and chill out

05:56.792 --> 05:59.292
and not kill the vibe before
we even get there, you know?

05:59.292 --> 06:01.125
- Yeah.
- I want to catch the fish.

06:01.125 --> 06:02.792
Yeah.

06:04.792 --> 06:05.875
- Start back here.

06:05.875 --> 06:08.792
Three, two, one.

06:08.792 --> 06:10.208
Go.

06:11.208 --> 06:12.792
- Oh, my God.

06:12.792 --> 06:15.042
- Aw.
- Whoo! Ooh!

06:17.458 --> 06:20.375
- Oh, ho-ho,
she got movin'.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.875
- It's freezing!

06:27.750 --> 06:29.542
- I can't believe
they go off board tomorrow.

06:29.542 --> 06:31.333
Do you know what that means?

06:31.333 --> 06:33.083
You're gonna go fishing,
and then we're going dancin'.

06:33.083 --> 06:34.583
- Okay.
- Yeah.

06:34.583 --> 06:36.083
- Sounds like a plan.

06:36.083 --> 06:38.333
My horoscope said
I'm gonna be on all day.

06:38.333 --> 06:39.500
- What did mine say?

06:39.500 --> 06:40.917
- I didn't read yours.

06:40.917 --> 06:42.250
- That's a good start
to a relationship.

06:42.250 --> 06:44.042
F--- your horoscope.

06:48.083 --> 06:51.083
- What does this do?

06:51.083 --> 06:53.167
So Ben.
- Yes.

06:53.167 --> 06:54.750
- Let's talk about tonight.
- Yeah.

06:54.750 --> 06:57.083
- So I'm doing, like,
a white chapel wedding

06:57.083 --> 06:59.875
Elvis/Vegas theme.

06:59.875 --> 07:02.042
So will you be Elvis?

07:02.042 --> 07:04.417
You've got the darkest hair.

07:04.417 --> 07:06.583
- Oh, phht.

07:06.583 --> 07:07.792
No.
- Say something Elvis-y.

07:07.792 --> 07:09.125
- No.

07:09.125 --> 07:10.583
- You don't know
how good that looks

07:10.583 --> 07:11.917
You should keep those
for everyday.

07:11.917 --> 07:14.042
- Oh.

07:14.042 --> 07:16.292
- Fine.

07:18.625 --> 07:22.292
- Has Steve mentioned anything
about hitting golf balls to you?

07:22.292 --> 07:24.125
- Not today, he hasn't.

07:24.125 --> 07:25.958
- He's interested in
golfing on the yacht.

07:25.958 --> 07:27.375
That's cool.

07:27.375 --> 07:29.125
- I'll go talk to him
and see what--

07:29.125 --> 07:31.125
- Yeah, see if he--
if he's still up for it,

07:31.125 --> 07:33.125
if he wants to do it, because
we're running out of daylight.

07:33.125 --> 07:34.875
- Okay. Hey, Steve.
- Yeah.

07:34.875 --> 07:36.292
- I know you talked
about golfing.

07:36.292 --> 07:37.625
- Yeah.
- Are you still...

07:37.625 --> 07:38.792
- Sorry.
- Interested in doing that?

07:38.792 --> 07:40.292
- Yeah.
- Okay.

07:40.292 --> 07:41.625
So we'll get that
set up right now

07:41.625 --> 07:42.958
before we start losing
all the light

07:42.958 --> 07:44.792
so you can actually see
how far you hit.

07:44.792 --> 07:46.333
- That's pretty awesome. Cool.
- All right, great.

07:46.333 --> 07:47.458
- Thank you.
- No problem.

07:47.458 --> 07:48.667
So we're gonna get this removed.

07:48.667 --> 07:50.083
I'm gonna go get
the stuff up.

07:50.083 --> 07:52.250
- No, he's not gonna hit
off the bunny pad.

07:52.250 --> 07:53.833
- Oh, he's not gonna hit off--
- No, that's not gonna happen.

07:53.833 --> 07:55.333
- Okay.
- No.

07:55.333 --> 07:56.833
- Sorry. I thought that's--
- Go get the mat

07:56.833 --> 07:58.167
and we'll set it up
right in front

07:58.167 --> 07:59.958
of those two handrails.

07:59.958 --> 08:02.458
- Okay. Roger that.

08:02.458 --> 08:04.250
- It's really getting
kind of old.

08:04.250 --> 08:06.958
I still have to come up
with a plan of action

08:06.958 --> 08:09.125
every day for every activity

08:09.125 --> 08:11.583
for everything
that's getting done.

08:11.583 --> 08:14.792
It just doesn't seem
to be happening.

08:14.792 --> 08:17.125
- So we're gonna
hit golf balls.

08:17.125 --> 08:18.917
- F---, I was getting dressed
already for the night.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.750
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

08:20.750 --> 08:22.333
- Can you throw
something casual on?

08:22.333 --> 08:23.667
- Mind if I hit one,
Cap?

08:23.667 --> 08:25.833
- Yes, I do.
- I played golf, Cap.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.458
- I don't care.

08:27.458 --> 08:30.458
- Captain seems to be
really on Kelley's ass,

08:30.458 --> 08:32.375
and I understand why,
but at the same time,

08:32.375 --> 08:35.125
I've been there myself before,
and it was not fun.

08:35.125 --> 08:36.875
- So here's what we got.
- Okay.

08:36.875 --> 08:38.958
- An antiquated 5 wood.
- Uh-huh.

08:38.958 --> 08:40.625
You found these
on the bottom of the ocean.

08:40.625 --> 08:42.042
- May have.

08:42.042 --> 08:43.792
- I dove
and got 'em for you.

08:43.792 --> 08:45.542
- I'm just gonna try not to hit
that or any of this.

08:45.542 --> 08:49.458
Chipping paint's
like 10 grand.

08:49.458 --> 08:51.708
I didn't break anything.

08:51.708 --> 08:53.375
- Oh, there you go.

08:53.375 --> 08:55.625
- This is great.
You feeling confident?

08:55.625 --> 08:57.125
- No. Try to hit that boat.

08:57.125 --> 08:58.333
- I tried it.

08:58.333 --> 08:59.875
Into the wind,
it's challenging.

08:59.875 --> 09:02.125
- It's impossible, huh?

09:02.125 --> 09:04.208
- Oh, that sounded good.
- Good one.

09:04.208 --> 09:05.667
- There you go.
- There we go.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.375
- That's cool that
they set it up.

09:07.375 --> 09:08.625
- Dude.
- Okay.

09:08.625 --> 09:10.917
- We got a couple
playing through here.

09:15.917 --> 09:17.250
- Hey, Nico.
- Hey.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.583
- Are you an Elvis fan?

09:18.583 --> 09:20.042
- Elvis Presley? Why?
- Yeah.

09:20.042 --> 09:21.917
Would you like
to be Elvis tonight?

09:21.917 --> 09:23.375
I mean, you are
the most handsome.

09:23.375 --> 09:24.667
- Well...

09:26.250 --> 09:27.417
- Like, look
into this reflection,

09:27.417 --> 09:29.333
and just, like, really--

09:29.333 --> 09:30.583
- Be him.
- Yeah.

09:30.583 --> 09:32.083
- Be Elvis.
- Yeah. Hold on.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.750
- Maybe I look like Elvis.

09:33.750 --> 09:35.917
Chiseled jaw, great looks,

09:35.917 --> 09:37.500
charming personality.

09:37.500 --> 09:39.417
Oh, thank you,
thank you.

09:39.417 --> 09:41.000
Thank you very much. A'right?
- Kelley, Kelley, Kelley,

09:41.000 --> 09:42.750
would you be
at all interested

09:42.750 --> 09:45.167
in being one of our Vegas
entertainers this evening?

09:45.167 --> 09:46.917
I'm thinking...

09:46.917 --> 09:48.833
- Oh, no!

09:50.958 --> 09:53.458
- Ben, are you re--
can I seat the guests?

09:53.458 --> 09:54.542
- Yes, please.

10:01.792 --> 10:03.292
- How cool!

10:03.292 --> 10:05.583
- That's so cool.
- Ooh.

10:05.583 --> 10:07.042
- It was like--
it's like the Vegas--

10:07.042 --> 10:08.875
- Oh, my gosh, how cute!

10:08.875 --> 10:11.083
- And this is your bow tie.

10:11.083 --> 10:12.708
- I don't know how
to make that into a bow tie.

10:14.625 --> 10:16.292
She knows how to tie
a bow tie.

10:16.292 --> 10:18.250
That's pretty impressive.

10:18.250 --> 10:20.292
I'm not sure if Emily's
looking for a relationship,

10:20.292 --> 10:21.792
if she's looking for nothing,
if she's looking just for fun,

10:21.792 --> 10:23.375
like me.

10:23.375 --> 10:25.875
But as of right now, who knows?

10:27.083 --> 10:30.042
- Meow.

10:30.042 --> 10:33.083
- I think Kelley is quite
sentimental and soft,

10:33.083 --> 10:34.625
so I don't want to tell him

10:34.625 --> 10:36.000
that I'm going
on a date with Ben.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.958
Oh, look at that.

10:37.958 --> 10:40.083
He's a lovely guy,
and I don't want to hurt him,

10:40.083 --> 10:41.750
and I don't want this
to affect our friendship.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.500
- Please take pictures.

10:43.500 --> 10:45.000
Now.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.292
- Babykins.
- Yes.

10:48.292 --> 10:50.125
- Here we go.
- Thank you.

10:50.125 --> 10:53.625
This is the eggplant with?
- That's it. Truffle, soy.

10:53.625 --> 10:55.625
Spicy crab roll.
- Thank you.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.333
- So when we were
talking about diamonds,

10:57.333 --> 10:58.792
I was like,
"I want eight carats."

10:58.792 --> 11:00.583
And he was like,
"Yeah, three is my max."

11:00.583 --> 11:03.167
And I was, like, "I'll
compromise and give you four."

11:04.333 --> 11:05.792
- Go figure.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.458
I love it.

11:08.458 --> 11:10.958
- Thank you,
thank you, thank you very much.

11:10.958 --> 11:13.125
- Oh, my God, so good.

11:13.125 --> 11:15.708
- I gotta give
the kids a little bit more room.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.667
- Oh, yeah.

11:17.667 --> 11:20.625
- Then stop staring
at the moose knuckle.

11:22.375 --> 11:24.042
- Coming up...

11:24.042 --> 11:26.167
- Ben, your lady is waiting
in the main salon.

11:26.167 --> 11:27.500
- What lady?
- Emily.

11:27.500 --> 11:28.958
They're going on a date.
- Oh.

11:28.958 --> 11:30.292
What?

11:30.292 --> 11:32.333
- Yeah, you look great.

11:36.042 --> 11:36.417
- Everything was good.

11:37.333 --> 11:38.875
- Yeah, it was.

11:38.875 --> 11:40.000
- F--- yeah.
- F--- that, dude.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.000
- No, that looks good.

11:43.375 --> 11:44.708
Huh!

11:46.667 --> 11:48.208
- Let's do this.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.042
- So we'll go have
a little dance party.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.958
Deck crew, deck crew,
we're on our way up.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.000
Please start the music.

11:53.000 --> 11:54.542
- Copy, baby.

11:54.542 --> 11:55.917
- Come in, guys.

11:55.917 --> 11:57.417
- Oh, we--
- Come on in!

11:57.417 --> 11:59.542
- We got strippers.
Yeah, we got strippers!

11:59.542 --> 12:01.375
- Come on in.
- Uh-oh.

12:01.375 --> 12:03.083
- Welcome to Las Valor.

12:03.083 --> 12:06.917
- What happens in Las Valor
stays in Las Valor.

12:06.917 --> 12:07.875
Baby!

12:07.875 --> 12:09.250
Uh-huh, uh-huh, uh-huh.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.417
Huh! Huh! Huh!

12:12.417 --> 12:14.417
Huh! Huh!

12:14.417 --> 12:16.167
- Yeah!
- Huh!

12:16.167 --> 12:17.333
Huh!

12:17.333 --> 12:18.750
Elvis loves performing.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.042
The more they have fun,

12:20.042 --> 12:22.417
the bigger the tip, hopefully.

12:23.917 --> 12:25.667
Enjoy your time together
tonight.

12:25.667 --> 12:26.708
- Hey.

12:26.708 --> 12:28.083
Ready?

12:29.417 --> 12:31.167
- Look at that cross your legs.
- Oh!

12:32.917 --> 12:34.708
- Whoo! Get it, Stace.

12:34.708 --> 12:36.917
- Elvis is out, people.
Huh!

12:46.083 --> 12:47.458
- I'm waking up early.
- Good night, Kelly.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.708
- Mwah.
- I'll see ya.

12:48.708 --> 12:50.042
- Good night, boo things.
- Night.

12:56.792 --> 12:59.417
- Ems, you're way above this.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.250
- Well, I felt really bad
'cause I just, um,

13:01.250 --> 13:02.625
put something
in the top of the bin

13:02.625 --> 13:03.625
and it dropped out.

13:03.625 --> 13:05.208
- Oh, gosh.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.958
I'd love to just spend
the rest of the evening

13:06.958 --> 13:08.208
with Emily.

13:08.208 --> 13:11.042
- I empty trash bags
for a living.

13:11.042 --> 13:12.792
- Yeah, it's
a nice feeling.

13:12.792 --> 13:15.958
Unfortunately,
yachts don't work like that.

13:15.958 --> 13:17.625
Emily's got me
a little rattled,

13:17.625 --> 13:20.792
and, uh, I have high hopes

13:20.792 --> 13:22.500
for--for this date.

13:22.500 --> 13:24.167
I'm gonna hit the hay.

13:24.167 --> 13:26.000
- You're smiling.
You can't stop smiling.

13:26.000 --> 13:27.417
Stop.

13:29.458 --> 13:30.958
I'm happy about,
you know, tomorrow,

13:30.958 --> 13:32.958
'cause I'm looking forward to...
- Yeah?

13:32.958 --> 13:35.167
- Spend some time
with Benjamin.

13:35.167 --> 13:37.583
I feel bad, 'cause...

13:37.583 --> 13:40.000
- Why do you feel bad?

13:40.000 --> 13:42.000
- Kelley wanted
to take me out too.

13:42.000 --> 13:45.417
- Listen, this is the best thing
for that situation,

13:45.417 --> 13:47.292
'cause it's never
gonna happen

13:47.292 --> 13:50.000
with Kelley and you,
right?

13:50.000 --> 13:53.583
Never.
I wouldn't even bring it up.

14:04.833 --> 14:06.708
- Ah, I get
to plan a wedding,

14:06.708 --> 14:08.625
and you just have to say,
"Yes, babe."

14:08.625 --> 14:10.458
- Yeah, like, okay.
- I love it.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.042
- How'd you sleep? All right?
- Yeah.

14:16.042 --> 14:17.708
- We should do
breakfast in here

14:17.708 --> 14:19.708
'cause it's very windy outside.
- Okay, cool.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.375
- Would you like some eggs?

14:21.375 --> 14:23.208
- Love some eggs.
Let me make some room.

14:23.208 --> 14:24.958
- You gonna let me throw him
a bachelor party?

14:26.667 --> 14:28.042
- Okay, let's do this.
Let's bring it up.

14:28.042 --> 14:29.042
- Copy.

14:31.125 --> 14:33.833
- Cap, we're moving over
to 12:00 here.

14:33.833 --> 14:36.667
- Perfect.

14:36.667 --> 14:39.375
- Anchor's off the bottom, Cap.
Anchor's off the bottom.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.000
- Roger that. Bring it up.

14:41.000 --> 14:42.833
- Mm, have you got it on?

14:42.833 --> 14:44.208
- Yeah, I want it on
all the time.

14:44.208 --> 14:45.708
- I love that she
has tiny fingers,

14:45.708 --> 14:47.417
'cause then it makes it
look so much bigger.

14:49.917 --> 14:51.250
- Good morning.

14:51.250 --> 14:52.333
- You look stunning
this morning.

14:52.333 --> 14:54.042
- Thank you. You too.

14:54.042 --> 14:56.708
So, Kyle, is your family
still in the U.K.?

14:59.042 --> 15:00.500
- I'm not very close
to my family.

15:00.500 --> 15:02.333
I left home at 15 and 8 months.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.000
I signed the dotted line,
said good-bye to my dad,

15:04.000 --> 15:05.500
and walked out the door
and joined the army.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.750
- Why'd you be homeless?
- No, no, no.

15:11.750 --> 15:13.417
And I'd be like,
"Well, ladies and gentlemen,

15:13.417 --> 15:16.250
"at the end of the day,
what's my favorite nation?

15:16.250 --> 15:17.750
A donation," you know?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.083
- Ay.

15:19.083 --> 15:20.917
- When did you decide,
"You know what?

15:20.917 --> 15:24.208
I'm just gonna go to London
and work as a performer?"

15:28.208 --> 15:30.083
- Wait, did she live
on the streets with you?

15:30.083 --> 15:31.958
- No, no, she had a great job.
She was the lead design--

15:31.958 --> 15:34.417
- Why didn't she let you
stay at her place?

15:35.917 --> 15:37.625
- This is so romantic.

15:37.625 --> 15:38.875
So you were homeless,

15:38.875 --> 15:39.958
trying to create a life

15:39.958 --> 15:41.625
in London for this girl?

15:41.625 --> 15:43.000
- Yeah.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.458
- I don't think Kyle's
embarrassed about anything.

15:50.458 --> 15:52.625
I love it when people
have no apologies

15:52.625 --> 15:53.958
for who they really are.

15:53.958 --> 15:55.542
It's refreshing.

15:55.542 --> 15:57.625
Wow, Kyle.
- Let's go, Kyle.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.583
- I love you so much.
- I've got to rock and roll.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.042
Be back in a sec.
- Okay.

16:01.042 --> 16:02.792
- Right, where do you want me,
on the bow?

16:02.792 --> 16:04.375
- Yeah, you're up on the bow.

16:04.375 --> 16:05.458
- I just want to stay here
forever.

16:10.833 --> 16:12.583
- Pull that line up.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.500
- I'm on my mark right here.

16:14.500 --> 16:16.000
- I think we look
pretty good right there.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.792
- Lock it off.

16:17.792 --> 16:19.083
- Nope, always do
a figure eight.

16:19.083 --> 16:20.333
- Locked in, looking good.

16:20.333 --> 16:21.583
Good on the bow.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.667
- Go ahead
and shut the mains down.

16:22.667 --> 16:24.333
- Deck crew, go ahead

16:24.333 --> 16:25.833
and start grabbing
guest luggage.

16:25.833 --> 16:27.833
- Nice job, deck crew.
Thank you.

16:27.833 --> 16:30.000
- Any time Captain Lee's happy
with what the deck crew's done,

16:30.000 --> 16:32.000
that makes me very happy.

16:34.333 --> 16:35.833
- Sierra, we have to talk.

16:35.833 --> 16:36.917
- About what?

16:36.917 --> 16:38.167
- This is an intervention.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.417
- What's going on?

16:39.417 --> 16:41.750
- You have to give Kyle
a chance.

16:41.750 --> 16:43.417
- Why?

16:43.417 --> 16:46.667
- He is courageous,
generous, kindhearted.

16:46.667 --> 16:48.000
He's--
- So why don't you date him?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.708
- 'Cause I'm in love
with Ro.

16:49.708 --> 16:52.875
He is real-life
British Ryan Gosling.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.708
- He does look like him.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.125
Looks aren't, like,
the end-all to end all for me.

16:57.125 --> 16:59.125
I'm more focused between
what's a guy's ears

16:59.125 --> 17:00.958
than what's between his head
and his knees.

17:02.292 --> 17:05.042
- The lengths he went
for a girl he loves

17:05.042 --> 17:07.125
is mind-blowing.

17:07.125 --> 17:08.958
- Guess I'm gonna have
to wait and see.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.708
- Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

17:15.708 --> 17:18.042
I need everybody on the aft deck

17:18.042 --> 17:20.125
in 15.

17:20.125 --> 17:21.125
- Almost ready.
- Okay.

17:21.125 --> 17:22.125
- Mm-hmm.

17:23.167 --> 17:24.375
- There she is.

17:24.375 --> 17:25.708
- I'm here.

17:27.458 --> 17:29.917
- I never had anybody
wait on me.

17:29.917 --> 17:31.250
You're so nice.

17:31.250 --> 17:32.750
- Kelley.
- It was a pleasure.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.250
- Great to meet you.
- Definitely a pleasure.

17:34.250 --> 17:35.750
I had a great time.
Thank you.

17:35.750 --> 17:38.000
- Put it here.
Thank you for everything, buddy.

17:38.000 --> 17:39.333
Nice to see you
in South Florida, man.

17:39.333 --> 17:40.917
- Thanks for everything.

17:40.917 --> 17:43.042
Being out on the water,
snorkeling, getting engaged,

17:43.042 --> 17:44.500
you set up a great trip.

17:44.500 --> 17:45.917
- It's our pleasure.
You guys were great.

17:45.917 --> 17:47.417
- You got a great crew,
- It was so awesome.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.875
- And I really appreciate it.
Thank you.

17:48.875 --> 17:50.208
Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

17:50.208 --> 17:52.333
- And that is to show
my appreciation.

17:52.333 --> 17:53.417
- Oh.
- Bye!

17:53.417 --> 17:55.542
Thank you.
- Thank you.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.375
- Let's go to work.
- Trip of a lifetime.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.083
- Thank you so much
for taking me.

17:59.083 --> 18:00.875
I love you.

18:03.667 --> 18:05.167
- Do you know what
I really want to do today?

18:05.167 --> 18:06.917
- What?
- I wanna get drunk.

18:06.917 --> 18:08.208
You know, it's funny,
unless I have a girl with me,

18:08.208 --> 18:10.042
I don't get wasted.

18:10.042 --> 18:12.792
If I have a girl with me, I try
to get as wasted as possible.

18:12.792 --> 18:15.625
- I'm really ecstatic
to go out tonight.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.083
I go, like, porn star
when I'm drunk.

18:17.083 --> 18:18.625
- Really?
- Oh, man.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.708
All I really wanna do is
spend some time with Emily.

18:20.708 --> 18:22.292
And I was like,
"Oh, it's on."

18:24.542 --> 18:26.375
- Attention all crew,
attention all crew.

18:26.375 --> 18:29.875
I need everybody
in the crew mess ASAP.

18:29.875 --> 18:31.792
- Copy.

18:34.292 --> 18:36.375
- I'm getting there.
- Hey, I want to--

18:36.375 --> 18:38.292
- Whoa.

18:38.292 --> 18:39.792
- Mm.

18:39.792 --> 18:40.958
- That's all the room
you get.

18:44.708 --> 18:46.458
Is this table moving?

18:46.458 --> 18:47.625
'Cause that's a new thing
I've noticed.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.042
I always put my leg up.

18:49.042 --> 18:50.375
Clearly Kelley
doesn't know yet

18:50.375 --> 18:51.792
Ben's asked me out on a date,

18:51.792 --> 18:53.250
because he's lounging on me.

18:53.250 --> 18:55.000
Bless him.

18:55.000 --> 18:56.500
- How we doing?

18:56.500 --> 18:58.667
Good.

18:58.667 --> 19:01.167
- So all in all,
I think it went well.

19:01.167 --> 19:03.000
Interior, you guys
just nailed it.

19:03.000 --> 19:04.500
Sweet.

19:04.500 --> 19:06.500
Exterior, we had some hiccups.

19:06.500 --> 19:07.667
- Oh, f---!

19:10.333 --> 19:12.500
- Coming up...
- Are you upset at me?

19:12.500 --> 19:14.000
- No, I just don't want you
playing with Kyle.

19:14.000 --> 19:15.333
You did not tell him the truth.

19:15.333 --> 19:16.833
- You shouldn't be judging me.

19:16.833 --> 19:18.542
Kelley, I'm not done
talking to you.

19:23.833 --> 19:25.500
- Interior, you guys
just nailed it.

19:25.500 --> 19:26.625
Sweet.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.125
Exterior, we had some hiccups.

19:28.125 --> 19:30.500
Okay, it might have been
a good idea

19:30.500 --> 19:32.083
for us to be
a little more proactive.

19:32.083 --> 19:34.708
- All right.
Can do next time.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.042
- Okay.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.708
Let's get rid of some money.

19:38.708 --> 19:40.375
They tipped us 15 grand.

19:40.375 --> 19:43.375
That's $1,350 apiece.

19:43.375 --> 19:47.208
- 48 hours of work,
$1,350 each.

19:47.208 --> 19:48.792
Very happy with that.
Can't complain.

19:48.792 --> 19:51.708
- You guys can get busy
flipping the boat.

19:52.875 --> 19:54.208
- What do you need?

19:57.542 --> 19:59.875
- You can go fishing
for a couple of hours

19:59.875 --> 20:01.208
- Thank you.
- And--

20:01.208 --> 20:03.375
but I do expect you
to make it up.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.875
You can go out
to dinner tonight.

20:04.875 --> 20:06.333
- Sounds good.
- Thanks, Captain.

20:06.333 --> 20:07.542
- Thank you.
- Thanks, guys.

20:19.083 --> 20:21.500
- I need to charter a boat.
Crackin'.

20:23.250 --> 20:24.500
Do you want to start
getting ready?

20:24.500 --> 20:25.875
- Mm-hmm.

20:27.417 --> 20:29.917
- Maybe they are skinny.

20:29.917 --> 20:31.250
I'm very, very happy,

20:31.250 --> 20:32.667
that I'm going out
with Sierra.

20:32.667 --> 20:34.708
I like fishing.
I like nice women.

20:34.708 --> 20:36.500
So f---in' either way,
I'm winning.

20:36.500 --> 20:37.917
- Pink is in.

20:37.917 --> 20:39.375
- I love that!

20:39.375 --> 20:40.917
- You're not going
to a baby shower.

20:40.917 --> 20:43.208
You kids have fun.

20:43.208 --> 20:45.542
- Ems, he's not wearing
that shirt. Burn it.

20:45.542 --> 20:46.667
- It's cute.

20:46.667 --> 20:48.542
- Let's do it.

20:48.542 --> 20:50.667
Come on, we're gonna miss
the boat. We're late.

20:50.667 --> 20:52.083
Kyle.
- Welcome aboard.

20:52.083 --> 20:55.208
Okay, let's go try
to catch some fish.

20:55.208 --> 20:57.500
- Champagne.
- Thanks so much.

20:57.500 --> 20:58.792
- Kyle!

20:58.792 --> 21:01.625
You better catch something!

21:08.417 --> 21:11.125
- Well, the aim of the game
today is catch a bunch of fish.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.083
Let's have a load of fun.

21:13.083 --> 21:14.583
And then we'll go
get some dinner,

21:14.583 --> 21:15.792
and then we'll meet up
with everybody else.

21:15.792 --> 21:18.292
- Sounds good.
- You happy with that?

21:18.292 --> 21:20.042
It's a deal.

21:20.042 --> 21:22.208
Sierra doesn't know what
it's like to be romanced,

21:22.208 --> 21:24.292
so tonight, I'm pulling out
all the stops,

21:24.292 --> 21:25.542
and she's having it.

21:29.958 --> 21:31.208
- Oh, I'm tired.

21:31.208 --> 21:32.792
- So do you know
the plan for tonight?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.250
- Do I know the plan?
- Yeah.

21:34.250 --> 21:37.708
- Well, I'm going
to dinner with Ben.

21:37.708 --> 21:39.333
- With Ben?

21:39.333 --> 21:41.250
- Yeah, girl,
you little cheeky sod.

21:44.250 --> 21:46.500
No to Kelley
and yes to Ben, hey?

21:46.500 --> 21:48.500
- Who asked me first?

21:48.500 --> 21:50.083
- Well, that's true.
- Kelley.

21:50.083 --> 21:51.625
- Ben. Kelley didn't
already ask me anything.

21:51.625 --> 21:52.917
I said, "Oh, they're
going on a date."

21:52.917 --> 21:54.250
He was like,
"Oh, are they?"

21:54.250 --> 21:55.500
I said, "Yeah,
they're going fishing."

21:55.500 --> 21:57.167
He was like,
"Oh, we should go."

21:57.167 --> 22:00.833
He wasn't like, "Oh,
let's go fishing tomorrow."

22:00.833 --> 22:02.417
Kelley is gonna flip.

22:02.417 --> 22:03.792
He really does like her,

22:03.792 --> 22:04.958
so I'm staying out of this.

22:04.958 --> 22:06.000
Like, I'm not gonna tell him.

22:06.000 --> 22:07.333
He can figure it out himself.

22:07.333 --> 22:08.667
- Two cool people...
- Two cool people.

22:08.667 --> 22:10.792
Having a cool meal.

22:12.667 --> 22:15.250
- How are you feeling now?

22:15.250 --> 22:18.792
- Got your little throw.
- Do you want to sit here?

22:18.792 --> 22:20.792
- Um...maybe.

22:20.792 --> 22:22.208
- Let's try. Let's try.
- Probably not.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.333
- Let's try. Let's try.

22:23.333 --> 22:25.208
I'll sit on you.
- No.

22:28.125 --> 22:29.375
- There we go.
- Well...

22:29.375 --> 22:30.542
- Jump in.
- No, I'm good.

22:30.542 --> 22:32.125
- Let me get
my arm around you.

22:32.125 --> 22:33.375
- I'm great here.
- That's fine.

22:33.375 --> 22:35.208
- Okay.
- I'm happy with that.

22:35.208 --> 22:37.333
- This is fun.

22:37.333 --> 22:38.792
It makes me slightly
uncomfortable

22:38.792 --> 22:42.167
the way Kyle is so persistent
and adamant

22:42.167 --> 22:43.875
about being flirty.

22:43.875 --> 22:45.625
But for me, I thought it
would be a cool opportunity

22:45.625 --> 22:48.333
for two adults
to go and hang out

22:48.333 --> 22:50.833
and get to know each other
outside of work.

22:50.833 --> 22:52.458
- Are you a fisherwoman?
Do you love fish?

22:52.458 --> 22:53.542
- Yeah, I'll bait my hook.

22:53.542 --> 22:54.792
- Might bite the end off it.

22:54.792 --> 22:56.667
- No, f--- that.
- Come on.

22:58.875 --> 23:00.958
- Or I could be
in the hot tub, you know,

23:00.958 --> 23:02.667
doing some yoga,
just like that.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.250
- Oh, you're that bored
of me right now?

23:04.250 --> 23:06.417
- No, not bored at all.

23:10.083 --> 23:11.917
- Are we on?

23:11.917 --> 23:13.208
Oh, no.
- No.

23:17.750 --> 23:20.417
- This is not the kind
of fishing I expected.

23:22.667 --> 23:23.750
Where you going?

23:23.750 --> 23:25.333
- It's so late in the day.

23:27.917 --> 23:29.167
- Kelley?
- Yeah!

23:29.167 --> 23:30.250
- I'm in here.

23:30.250 --> 23:31.667
- I'm coming in.

23:31.667 --> 23:34.833
No, don't.

23:34.833 --> 23:36.917
- So Ben's rooming with Kelley,

23:36.917 --> 23:39.583
and Kelley likes Emily.

23:39.583 --> 23:43.083
This is, like, a bad situation.

23:43.083 --> 23:44.375
- Hey, sporty, what's up?

23:44.375 --> 23:45.542
- Sh--, man.

23:45.542 --> 23:46.958
- Hey, can you plug in
that iron?

23:46.958 --> 23:49.042
- F---.
- Thanks, mate.

23:51.375 --> 23:54.500
- Oh, my God, I have Wi-Fi here.
This is awesome.

23:56.750 --> 23:58.083
- Yeah.
- There is, is there?

23:58.083 --> 23:59.125
- Yeah, there is.

24:04.625 --> 24:07.625
- I'm just gonna sip my wine
over here by myself.

24:07.625 --> 24:09.792
- This is
the best date ever.

24:14.250 --> 24:16.542
- Oh, it's fine.
I'm a boat person.

24:23.458 --> 24:25.458
- How did the date go?
- Well, she f---in'--

24:25.458 --> 24:27.167
She was texting
her f---in' guy friend

24:27.167 --> 24:28.833
the entire f---in' time.

24:28.833 --> 24:30.667
- What?
- Yeah.

24:30.667 --> 24:33.417
- Why would she do that?

24:33.417 --> 24:35.083
Is that first time
she's mentioned it?

24:35.083 --> 24:36.500
- Yeah.
- And she waited for the date.

24:36.500 --> 24:38.250
Yeah.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.667
- My biggest belief in life is,

24:39.667 --> 24:41.333
no one can blame you
for being honest.

24:41.333 --> 24:42.833
So if you're truthful,
doesn't matter.

24:42.833 --> 24:44.833
If you're a liar,
then it does matter.

24:44.833 --> 24:46.333
- Did she make you
feel special at least?

24:48.417 --> 24:50.167
There you go, buddy.

24:50.167 --> 24:52.500
- Love you.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.958
- Never leave me.
- How was it?

24:53.958 --> 24:55.333
- Did you have fun?
- It was fun, yeah.

24:55.333 --> 24:56.792
It was good
to be out on the water.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.167
- I have no idea.

25:01.167 --> 25:03.667
- I don't know. I wasn't texting
my boyfriend, actually.

25:03.667 --> 25:05.667
- Yeah, dick--dick move.
- It was fun.

25:05.667 --> 25:06.792
You're the meanest.

25:06.792 --> 25:07.833
Mm-hmm.

25:09.708 --> 25:11.708
- Oh, hello.
- Ooh, yeah!

25:11.708 --> 25:13.667
- You don't want it too perfect.
It's the Caribbean.

25:15.958 --> 25:17.792
- Do you want to get him?

25:17.792 --> 25:19.625
- I feel like he should--like,
I don't feel like you should

25:19.625 --> 25:21.375
go get him for a date.
- Yeah.

25:21.375 --> 25:23.125
- I'll get him.

25:23.125 --> 25:26.500
Ben, your lady is waiting
in the main salon.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.375
- Oh.
- Your lady? What lady?

25:28.375 --> 25:29.958
- Emily.
They're going on a date.

25:29.958 --> 25:31.542
- Oh.

25:33.792 --> 25:35.542
What?

25:35.542 --> 25:37.333
Bro, like, I thought
we were buddies,

25:37.333 --> 25:40.208
but you've just left me
in the cold dark.

25:40.208 --> 25:41.708
- Hello.
- Hey, how are you doing?

25:41.708 --> 25:43.375
- Good.
- Good, good.

25:44.708 --> 25:45.708
- Yeah, you look great.

25:46.792 --> 25:49.208
After you.

25:49.208 --> 25:52.083
It's a very snazzy
little dress you've got on.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.833
- Oh, thank you.

25:53.833 --> 25:57.542
- I'm really thankful
for sharing time with Emily,

25:57.542 --> 26:00.667
to get away from all
of the personalities

26:00.667 --> 26:03.667
and just have a really
civilized, nice dinner.

26:06.417 --> 26:08.083
- Emily's going with him.

26:08.083 --> 26:09.500
- I do think it's a bit
of a harsh move, though.

26:09.500 --> 26:11.333
- Mm-hmm.

26:11.333 --> 26:13.583
It's funny, because he goes
through a girl every charter,

26:13.583 --> 26:15.708
for every charter season,
different girl.

26:15.708 --> 26:17.083
- So it happened before?

26:17.083 --> 26:19.750
- Mm, every charter season
he's been on.

26:19.750 --> 26:21.583
When did Ben
get interested in Emily

26:21.583 --> 26:23.250
and Emily interested in Ben?

26:23.250 --> 26:25.417
This is like a fly ball
to left field,

26:25.417 --> 26:26.792
and I'm sitting out there
picking daisies.

26:29.917 --> 26:32.292
- Oh, dude, that would have
pissed me the f--- off.

26:32.292 --> 26:34.125
- I'm still taking her
for dinner.

26:34.125 --> 26:35.375
- You're still taking her
for dinner?

26:35.375 --> 26:36.958
F--- that, bro.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.708
If she's texting--
texting a guy back home,

26:38.708 --> 26:40.458
why waste your time?

26:40.458 --> 26:42.292
Leave her here on the boat.

26:42.292 --> 26:44.458
You're just like me; you're just
gonna end up getting hurt.

26:44.458 --> 26:47.625
I'm not gonna let Kyle
get f---ed over, not now.

26:47.625 --> 26:51.250
Tonight, it--I just want it
to be about the deck crew.

26:51.250 --> 26:54.208
- Okay.

26:54.208 --> 26:55.792
- Coming up...

26:55.792 --> 26:58.083
- I need, like, a grilled cheese
before I go to bed.

26:58.083 --> 27:01.042
- God damn it.
That's a fire hazard.

27:01.042 --> 27:03.042
That can go bad.
I'm a bit worried about that.

27:03.042 --> 27:04.125
- What do you have there?

27:04.125 --> 27:05.625
- Someone left the toaster on.

27:05.625 --> 27:07.542
- And the hits keep coming.

27:14.583 --> 27:16.500
- It's very nice.
After you, Em.

27:16.500 --> 27:17.833
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

27:17.833 --> 27:19.500
- Hello, good evening.
- Good evening.

27:19.500 --> 27:20.500
- All right.
Oof.

27:20.500 --> 27:21.833
- There we go
with a wine.

27:21.833 --> 27:23.250
- Oh, perfect. Nice.
Thank you.

27:23.250 --> 27:25.083
- Oh, thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

27:25.083 --> 27:27.167
- I think I know exactly
what I'm looking at.

27:27.167 --> 27:29.000
I'm very decisive.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.333
- I think you are, as well,
after that speedy decision.

27:31.333 --> 27:34.167
- There's no pressure.
You take your time.

27:35.667 --> 27:37.000
- Do you have
any questions so far?

27:37.000 --> 27:38.500
- Oh, I've pretty much
made my mind up.

27:38.500 --> 27:41.000
Okay, um, seared scallops,
please.

27:41.000 --> 27:42.417
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:42.417 --> 27:44.000
I would love to get
the foie gras

27:44.000 --> 27:46.583
and the--okay, I'll get
the scallops then.

27:46.583 --> 27:47.667
- Yeah, try that too?
- Yeah, yeah.

27:47.667 --> 27:49.167
That would be awesome.
Thanks.

27:52.292 --> 27:53.833
- Yeah, I generally think

27:53.833 --> 27:55.167
I'm on the f---in' road
to nowhere there.

27:55.167 --> 27:56.542
- If she's sitting on a boat

27:56.542 --> 27:57.708
and texting her boyfriend
back home--

27:57.708 --> 27:59.167
- No, apparently wasn't.
I just--

27:59.167 --> 28:00.500
- No, she told me she was
messaging her friend.

28:00.500 --> 28:01.833
- Yeah, yeah.

28:01.833 --> 28:03.042
- She said she was
messaging a girlfriend.

28:03.042 --> 28:04.542
She's like,
"What are you up to?"

28:04.542 --> 28:06.167
- Oh, it's a girlfriend now.
I'm sorry,

28:06.167 --> 28:07.708
but she's lying
to your f---in' faces.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.500
I'm sorry; she's got
a boyfriend back home.

28:09.500 --> 28:12.042
If a girl texts while I'm
taking her out to dinner,

28:12.042 --> 28:13.500
I will say, "Excuse me.
I'm going to the bathroom,"

28:13.500 --> 28:15.083
and then walk the f---
out of that restaurant.

28:16.208 --> 28:17.208
- Yeah.
- Okay.

28:17.208 --> 28:19.542
- You tell her.
- All right.

28:19.542 --> 28:20.542
- God, Kelley's being
such a prick.

28:20.542 --> 28:22.542
- Why?
- He was like,

28:22.542 --> 28:24.208
"Don't f---ing go out with
a chick that's, like, talk--

28:24.208 --> 28:25.875
you know, texting
her boyfriend."

28:25.875 --> 28:27.542
- Kelley, just, like,
doesn't know anything.

28:27.542 --> 28:29.375
- We're all going
as a group.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.542
So we can go.
Just don't sit next to Kelley.

28:31.542 --> 28:33.792
- All right, well, if
Kelley's gonna be a dick,

28:33.792 --> 28:36.500
than I'll just leave.

28:36.500 --> 28:39.417
- I can taste the dill.
You like dill, don't you?

28:39.417 --> 28:43.333
- I'm kind of a big dill.

28:43.333 --> 28:45.417
No, I'm just kidding.
Um...

28:45.417 --> 28:47.500
I don't actually
like dill that much.

28:47.500 --> 28:48.750
- You don't?

28:48.750 --> 28:49.917
- Dill has a time
and a place.

28:49.917 --> 28:52.500
- Yeah.

28:52.500 --> 28:54.417
- This is really nice.

28:54.417 --> 28:57.750
- I value time one-on-one
with people

28:57.750 --> 28:59.417
and also time on my own.

28:59.417 --> 29:00.750
It's what surprised
people about

29:00.750 --> 29:02.583
especially taking
this job.

29:02.583 --> 29:04.583
- What did--like, what did
your folks say to that?

29:04.583 --> 29:06.375
- I mean, I'm always one
to just plan things

29:06.375 --> 29:08.042
and go ahead and do it.

29:08.042 --> 29:10.167
They knew they wouldn't have
been able to stop me.

29:10.167 --> 29:12.542
- Okay, so you're just
very independent, right?

29:12.542 --> 29:14.542
- Yeah, I'm very independent.
- Mm-hmm.

29:14.542 --> 29:16.750
- All in all, I wasn't happy,

29:16.750 --> 29:19.250
and I just changed
my circumstances

29:19.250 --> 29:21.250
and--and became happy.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.292
It's nice spending one-on-one
time together with someone.

29:24.292 --> 29:26.125
You know, we're getting
to know each other more,

29:26.125 --> 29:28.292
and I know that I enjoy
his company.

29:28.292 --> 29:30.958
It feels very easy and natural.

29:30.958 --> 29:33.458
What did your parents think
of you starting yachting?

29:33.458 --> 29:35.625
- Oh, they were glad
to get me out of the country.

29:35.625 --> 29:38.292
- Were they?

29:38.292 --> 29:39.792
- Hey.
- Hi.

29:39.792 --> 29:41.125
Kelley, can I
talk to you?

29:41.125 --> 29:43.875
- Sure.
- Hey.

29:43.875 --> 29:45.542
- You all right?
- Yeah.

29:45.542 --> 29:48.458
- Lauren said you're,
like, upset at me.

29:48.458 --> 29:50.125
Are you?
- No.

29:50.125 --> 29:51.458
No, I just don't want you
playing with Kyle.

29:51.458 --> 29:52.583
- I didn't do anything

29:52.583 --> 29:53.917
to play with him.
- Okay.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.625
- I couldn't have been
more straight up,

29:55.625 --> 29:57.458
'cause I feel like he...
- Yeah, but his feelings--

29:57.458 --> 29:59.042
- Doesn't understand.
- No, I don't think he does.

29:59.042 --> 30:00.792
You did not put the point across
well enough to him

30:00.792 --> 30:02.500
for him to understand.
You did not tell him the truth.

30:02.500 --> 30:04.667
That's it. End of story.
That's why I'm upset.

30:04.667 --> 30:06.417
- Telling the truth--
- So I--

30:06.417 --> 30:07.958
- About telling the truth?
- About telling the truth.

30:07.958 --> 30:10.292
- Oh, okay. Gotcha.

30:10.292 --> 30:11.833
- Yeah, keep smiling.
- All right.

30:11.833 --> 30:13.417
Kelley, I'm not done
talking to you.

30:13.417 --> 30:14.792
- I'm done.
- I feel like we don't

30:14.792 --> 30:16.500
understand each other.
- I'm done.

30:16.500 --> 30:17.750
- All right, well, I'm not
going out with you guys.

30:17.750 --> 30:18.792
- Okay.

30:18.792 --> 30:19.958
She's drama.

30:19.958 --> 30:22.125
She's not coming out.

30:22.125 --> 30:23.833
- I don't feel like that'll be
a fun time; I'm gonna stay here.

30:23.833 --> 30:25.625
- No, no, please come out.
- Wait, wait, wait, wait...

30:25.625 --> 30:26.958
- No. No way I'm going.
- Babe, you and me,

30:26.958 --> 30:28.417
let's f---ing go out.

30:28.417 --> 30:29.625
- We're not gonna have
fun 'cause--

30:29.625 --> 30:31.250
- This is, like,
making more drama.

30:31.250 --> 30:32.667
Like, this is what he wants.
- Making more drama?

30:32.667 --> 30:34.167
- Kelley.
- Stop.

30:34.167 --> 30:35.500
- Stop. Go.
- No, I'm just tired of her

30:35.500 --> 30:37.417
lying to him because she said--
- Kell--

30:37.417 --> 30:39.667
- I'm not gonna be treated
like this. I'm sorry.

30:39.667 --> 30:41.708
- Okay. F--- it.
- Yeah, let's go to dinner.

30:41.708 --> 30:43.667
- I'm sorry, I'm not gonna sit
there and let her lie to me.

30:43.667 --> 30:45.208
- I'll step out of it.

30:45.208 --> 30:47.500
Kyle got denied. It happens.
Let's move on.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.708
- Let's go.
- Jesus f---ing Christ.

30:49.708 --> 30:51.125
But now Kelley's
causing the scene.

30:51.125 --> 30:52.708
He's way out of line,

30:52.708 --> 30:54.833
probably because Emily's
out to dinner with Ben

30:54.833 --> 30:56.458
and so he's just lashing out
on people.

30:56.458 --> 30:58.042
- No, no, really.
- What's the problem here?

30:58.042 --> 31:00.542
- I told her she didn't tell
Kyle that--that--

31:00.542 --> 31:04.167
- It's--Kelley, it's really
none of your business.

31:04.167 --> 31:05.500
- It is because
it's affecting my crew.

31:05.500 --> 31:07.333
- No, no.
- She didn't tell him--

31:07.333 --> 31:08.875
when he's coming to me--
- You shouldn't be judging me.

31:08.875 --> 31:10.333
At all.
- I'm not judging you.

31:10.333 --> 31:11.708
- I'm not doing anything
that affects you.

31:11.708 --> 31:13.458
I've never been anything
but nice to you.

31:13.458 --> 31:14.667
- Listen, he was just
sticking up.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.042
You--nobody did anything wrong.

31:16.042 --> 31:17.792
- Guys, can we just
go out to dinner?

31:17.792 --> 31:19.875
- You're barking up the wrong
tree looking at me like that.

31:19.875 --> 31:21.875
- It's gonna be wonderful.
- I'm sorry. I'll see you later.

31:21.875 --> 31:23.500
- No, no. I'm here.
- No, I'm fine.

31:23.500 --> 31:25.250
- I'm waiting here.
I'm waiting here.

31:25.250 --> 31:27.083
- Lauren, come.

31:28.542 --> 31:30.167
F---!

31:30.167 --> 31:32.167
- He's jealous because
he just found out

31:32.167 --> 31:35.000
that Ben is going to dinner
with Emily, very abruptly.

31:35.000 --> 31:36.417
- You good?
- Yeah.

31:36.417 --> 31:38.167
- And he's taking it out on you

31:38.167 --> 31:40.000
and it's not fair
and it's not right,

31:40.000 --> 31:42.250
but that doesn't mean
you've done anything wrong.

31:42.250 --> 31:44.167
Jealousy's not a good look
on anyone.

31:44.167 --> 31:46.375
You can't always get
what you want.

31:46.375 --> 31:47.750
And part of growing up

31:47.750 --> 31:49.667
is learning
how to handle rejection.

31:49.667 --> 31:51.667
And that's just not a life skill
Kelley's mastered yet.

31:53.875 --> 31:55.375
- Well, she started this.

31:55.375 --> 31:58.167
She came up to me saying
I was upset with her.

31:58.167 --> 32:00.333
- I'm going for you.

32:00.333 --> 32:02.208
Let me get dressed
for a sec, okay?

32:06.958 --> 32:08.917
- What is it?
- Three, two, one, go.

32:13.458 --> 32:15.542
- It tastes like
cough syrup and ass.

32:15.542 --> 32:17.458
- Oh, it does.

32:17.458 --> 32:19.625
- You seemed slightly
nervous yesterday

32:19.625 --> 32:21.083
when you were asking me
out to dinner.

32:21.083 --> 32:23.292
- Well, I was because
you could have said no.

32:23.292 --> 32:25.250
- It was a breath
of fresh air for someone

32:25.250 --> 32:29.208
to actually verbally come
and ask me out for a meal.

32:29.208 --> 32:31.958
- Did Kelley try and invite you
out or something last night?

32:31.958 --> 32:34.583
- Kyle has this idea that
we're going on a date tomorrow.

32:34.583 --> 32:36.583
Kelley's like,
"Oh, you know, we should go."

32:36.583 --> 32:38.375
Emily is, like,
all weirded out.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.042
Like, I don't know
how to handle this.

32:42.083 --> 32:43.583
- I was very happy that
you did, actually.

32:43.583 --> 32:45.208
- Well, I'm glad I did.
- Yeah, no.

32:45.208 --> 32:46.875
- And I'm glad I'm sitting here

32:46.875 --> 32:48.167
and not Kelley.

32:49.417 --> 32:51.917
- So am I.
- Oh, perfect.

32:51.917 --> 32:54.167
Emily's an absolute joy
to talk to.

32:54.167 --> 32:56.833
She's very sophisticated,

32:56.833 --> 32:58.625
incredibly intelligent.

32:58.625 --> 33:00.667
It's nice to get
to know her better.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.167
All right, we will--
I'll get the bill.

33:02.167 --> 33:03.833
- Cheers!
- Cheers, mate.

33:03.833 --> 33:05.833
To Kelley not being here.

33:05.833 --> 33:07.167
- Oh, that's bad.

33:07.167 --> 33:08.500
I'm just kidding.

33:08.500 --> 33:09.958
- One shot.

33:09.958 --> 33:14.292
- Why does all your stuff
taste like sh--?

33:14.292 --> 33:15.583
- Thank you very much
for dinner.

33:15.583 --> 33:17.250
- Oh, no, you're welcome.
Thank you.

33:17.250 --> 33:19.625
- You should know better.
Like...

33:21.333 --> 33:22.583
- Yeah. Definitely.

33:22.583 --> 33:24.417
- Yours is
a little bitch pussy.

33:24.417 --> 33:25.917
You have so much left over.
- 'Cause mine's--look.

33:25.917 --> 33:28.375
'Cause it's stuck.
There we go.

33:28.375 --> 33:30.208
- Okay.

33:30.208 --> 33:31.375
- I don't know what
we're walking into,

33:31.375 --> 33:32.458
so you might have
to protect me.

33:32.458 --> 33:34.333
Yeah.

33:37.167 --> 33:39.708
- Uh-oh.

33:39.708 --> 33:42.375
- You can go to the table.
I'm gonna use the loo.

33:45.875 --> 33:47.458
- Coming up...

33:47.458 --> 33:49.375
- I just have one issue.
- What's that?

33:49.375 --> 33:51.500
- The pizza trail
coming up the stairs

33:51.500 --> 33:53.042
leading into my quarters.

33:53.042 --> 33:54.542
- Things are out of control.

33:54.542 --> 33:56.375
- Deal with it accordingly.
- I'm going to.

34:02.042 --> 34:02.583
- All right, are we ready, Em?

34:03.667 --> 34:05.208
- Yeah.

34:07.542 --> 34:09.667
- You can go to the table.
I'm gonna use the loo.

34:09.667 --> 34:11.333
You want to go
to the table together?

34:12.917 --> 34:15.000
- Wow.
- Hi.

34:15.000 --> 34:17.083
- Hey.
- Hello.

34:18.750 --> 34:21.417
- Ben and Emily going on a date
did surprise me.

34:21.417 --> 34:24.167
I knew nothing of this.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.583
Like, what? We're roommates.
Hello, bro.

34:26.583 --> 34:28.583
Yes!

34:28.583 --> 34:30.583
I'm so happy
to see you guys.

34:30.583 --> 34:33.083
- How's it going, y'all?

34:33.083 --> 34:35.083
- Look who's here, Ben.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.458
- I see that. Hey, guys.

34:39.917 --> 34:41.875
- Kind feel like
I got hit by a bus.

34:41.875 --> 34:44.667
Like, I hate, like,
confrontations,

34:44.667 --> 34:47.542
and, like, Kelley and I
got in an argument.

34:47.542 --> 34:49.833
Kyle apparently flipped out,

34:49.833 --> 34:52.083
and I think, like, to me, it
just seems like a little bit,

34:52.083 --> 34:54.625
like, overbearing
and expecting too much, like--

34:54.625 --> 34:57.417
- Hi, I was wondering
where you were.

34:57.417 --> 34:58.792
- Thank you.
- Here, scoot in.

34:58.792 --> 35:01.125
- It wasn't the fact
it was a date.

35:01.125 --> 35:03.625
I know you have someone
back home that likes you.

35:03.625 --> 35:05.625
I felt like,
I'm on a date with a girl,

35:05.625 --> 35:08.208
and she's giving interest
back home while I'm with her.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.958
- I respect that.
- And I always said

35:09.958 --> 35:13.083
that I think the sun shines
out your ass, though.

35:13.083 --> 35:14.792
I think you're amazing.

35:14.792 --> 35:16.542
And it f---in' hurt me.
- Well, I'm sorry.

35:16.542 --> 35:17.875
- That's how I felt.

35:17.875 --> 35:19.292
Let's just call it a day now,

35:19.292 --> 35:22.292
and let's just get on
with our lives.

35:25.208 --> 35:26.958
- Okay, this is us
getting on with our lives.

35:26.958 --> 35:28.125
- Oh, I feel better.

35:30.458 --> 35:32.625
- It's super awkward, like,

35:32.625 --> 35:34.667
you know, someone's emotional,
someone's piss drunk,

35:34.667 --> 35:37.167
someone's trying to get to know
someone else,

35:37.167 --> 35:39.167
someone's trying to diffuse
a situation from earlier,

35:39.167 --> 35:41.125
and I'm stuck in the middle
of all this emotions,

35:41.125 --> 35:42.750
and I'm like,
"I'm gonna order a pizza,

35:42.750 --> 35:44.917
and I'm gonna go home."

35:44.917 --> 35:47.458
I'm gonna pay for the pizza
and take it in a box to go.

35:47.458 --> 35:48.458
- Sure.

35:48.458 --> 35:50.500
- F---.

35:52.167 --> 35:54.958
- I just hope this guy back home
is really what you need.

35:59.583 --> 36:01.292
- I hope he looks after you.

36:01.292 --> 36:03.917
Time and effort
is what you need.

36:06.667 --> 36:09.125
- I can't believe
I'm not paying for this.

36:12.083 --> 36:15.333
- I genuinely do believe that
every woman deserves the best,

36:15.333 --> 36:17.208
but when she acts
the way she acts,

36:17.208 --> 36:19.042
she's never gonna have that.

36:19.042 --> 36:21.333
I'm gonna be nice,
but deep down, it's like...

36:22.875 --> 36:24.042
For some f---ing miracle

36:24.042 --> 36:25.542
Sierra comes knocking,

36:25.542 --> 36:27.333
the door will be locked.

36:27.333 --> 36:28.833
Once bitten, twice shy.

36:32.792 --> 36:33.875
- Grilled cheese sandwich,
okay.

36:33.875 --> 36:36.875
Let's do it.

36:38.292 --> 36:39.708
Cheese, everything.
- What kind?

36:39.708 --> 36:41.375
Everything.

36:41.375 --> 36:43.458
- Give me that sh--. No.
- No.

36:43.458 --> 36:44.875
- You didn't even see
what I got in there.

36:44.875 --> 36:46.875
- No, girl,
I've got your sh--.

36:46.875 --> 36:48.833
I'm gonna eat
your pizza.

36:48.833 --> 36:52.500
You think you're cute,
but you ain't getting that sh--.

36:52.500 --> 36:54.375
- Kyle, come over here
for a second.

37:00.083 --> 37:02.083
- Oui.			 Agree.
- Cut out early.

37:02.083 --> 37:03.583
- Actually,
we should just leave now.

37:03.583 --> 37:06.208
What about that?
- Go, go. Move, people, move.

37:10.000 --> 37:11.583
- I'm fine with Ben and Emily,

37:11.583 --> 37:13.750
but it's not something
I want to see tonight.

37:13.750 --> 37:16.500
Screw this day.
Kelley's gonna have a fun night.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.583
- Where did they go?

37:27.583 --> 37:29.000
Oh, gone off.

37:32.583 --> 37:34.000
Cheers.
- Cheers.

37:34.000 --> 37:35.417
- I had a really good
time tonight.

37:35.417 --> 37:36.917
- I did too.
- No, I honestly did.

37:36.917 --> 37:39.542
- Did you?
- Yes!

37:39.542 --> 37:42.125
- I just have one issue.

37:42.125 --> 37:43.708
- What's that?

37:43.708 --> 37:45.542
- Pizza trail leading
into my quarters, yeah.

37:45.542 --> 37:47.292
- Well, we don't need
to live in filth.

37:47.292 --> 37:49.792
- I don't appreciate it.
- Thank you for showing me.

37:49.792 --> 37:52.125
- If the captain is finding
half-eaten pizza

37:52.125 --> 37:53.958
on the way to his cabin,

37:53.958 --> 37:55.625
things are out of control.

37:55.625 --> 37:57.875
- I accept the fact that
you'll deal with it accordingly.

37:57.875 --> 37:59.750
- I'm going to.

37:59.750 --> 38:01.792
- Yeah, f--- the system!

38:01.792 --> 38:04.000
Ugh!

38:09.083 --> 38:10.250
- God damn it.

38:10.250 --> 38:12.875
F---.

38:12.875 --> 38:13.875
Oh, sh--.

38:13.875 --> 38:16.708
That's a fire hazard.

38:16.708 --> 38:18.958
- No, no.

38:18.958 --> 38:21.000
That can go bad.
I'm a bit worried about that.

38:24.333 --> 38:25.667
- What do you have there?

38:25.667 --> 38:29.000
- Someone left the toaster on.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.833
- And what's wrong with it?

38:30.833 --> 38:32.833
- Uh, it's just
smoking a bit.

38:32.833 --> 38:34.500
- Are you joking?

38:34.500 --> 38:37.000
- No, I don't think he's joking.

38:37.000 --> 38:38.833
And the hits keep coming.

38:38.833 --> 38:40.417
- I finally have the captain
calmed down,

38:40.417 --> 38:42.750
and could not be worse timing.

38:42.750 --> 38:44.167
You don't run
in front of the captain

38:44.167 --> 38:46.250
with a boat bomb in your hands.

38:46.250 --> 38:47.750
- The mistakes that
they're making

38:47.750 --> 38:49.667
could be a lesson that
they would never forget.

38:49.667 --> 38:51.333
- I will tell them that.

38:57.000 --> 38:58.417
Nico.
- Yeah.

38:58.417 --> 39:00.667
- I'm asking you
what the situation was.

39:00.667 --> 39:02.250
- The sandwich maker was on.

39:04.708 --> 39:07.042
- I honestly wasn't here.

39:07.042 --> 39:08.958
If I knew who it was,
I would tell you right now.

39:12.333 --> 39:14.208
- And that's it.

39:14.208 --> 39:15.667
- Hey.
- Dude.

39:15.667 --> 39:17.833
- Where have you been?

39:17.833 --> 39:18.875
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.042
Talk legit.

39:20.042 --> 39:21.542
- Excuse me,
you need to realize

39:21.542 --> 39:23.208
that we're talking about
a safety thing.

39:23.208 --> 39:25.708
I'm sorry to interrupt.
- No, that's okay.

39:25.708 --> 39:27.208
No, no, it's okay.
- Yeah.

39:27.208 --> 39:29.542
- Nico?
- No, no.

39:29.542 --> 39:31.833
- Who do you think
you guys are?

39:31.833 --> 39:34.000
I'm a pretty generous
chief stew.

39:34.000 --> 39:35.708
Everyone makes mistakes.

39:35.708 --> 39:37.958
But if you're gonna be
rude to me,

39:37.958 --> 39:39.708
I'm gonna be less forgiving.

39:46.250 --> 39:47.208
- It was kind of nice to find

39:46.750 --> 39:47.208
pizza laying on the floor

39:48.333 --> 39:49.583
going up to my quarters.

39:49.583 --> 39:51.000
- It's pretty embarrassing.

39:51.000 --> 39:53.333
- We cannot find you.

39:53.333 --> 39:56.250
We cannot find Sierra.

39:56.250 --> 39:57.917
- What happened was,
I'm cleaning the crew mess,

39:57.917 --> 39:59.417
'cause I just--

39:59.417 --> 40:01.083
- Why are you cleaning
the crew mess right now?

40:01.083 --> 40:02.750
- Do you know
what just happened?

40:02.750 --> 40:04.083
No.

40:04.083 --> 40:05.708
Exactly.
- I'll show you the photo.

40:05.708 --> 40:07.583
And then I was talking
to Nico

40:07.583 --> 40:09.417
about what happened
to the grill, and it was like,

40:09.417 --> 40:11.917
"Lauren, right now, we're
having an incident report.

40:11.917 --> 40:13.333
I want to know,
was it plugged in?"

40:13.333 --> 40:14.583
And she's like, "No, no."

40:14.583 --> 40:16.375
- We'll talk about it.

40:16.375 --> 40:17.667
Kate's trying to throw me
under the bus

40:17.667 --> 40:19.083
in front of the captain.

40:19.083 --> 40:21.417
So it was a little bit
of a dick move, yes.

40:34.292 --> 40:36.917
Yeah?

40:36.917 --> 40:38.583
- Ben's very good
at reading signals,

40:38.583 --> 40:40.250
and he's very respectful.

40:40.250 --> 40:45.292
And I feel like there's
genuine feelings there.

40:48.250 --> 40:51.958
- Before tonight, I really
didn't know much about Emily,

40:51.958 --> 40:55.083
and there was no real chemistry
between us.

40:55.083 --> 40:58.792
And--and I feel there is now,

40:58.792 --> 41:03.292
and I hope that we can
continue this.

41:03.292 --> 41:04.458
- Oh, hi.

41:04.458 --> 41:06.708
- The skillet was on me.

41:06.708 --> 41:09.167
The pizza,
I don't know who that was.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.167
- I know who it was.
- Here's the thing, Kate.

41:11.167 --> 41:13.083
There's been times where
we've cleaned up on deck

41:13.083 --> 41:14.750
that hasn't been always us.

41:14.750 --> 41:16.333
- That's not exactly
what bothered me the most.

41:16.333 --> 41:18.000
I don't mind doing it.
I don't like how

41:18.000 --> 41:20.583
when there's
a safety issue, Lauren--

41:20.583 --> 41:21.958
- At the same time,
though, Nico handled it.

41:21.958 --> 41:23.125
He took the skillet out.

41:23.125 --> 41:25.125
- It was a dangerous situation.

41:34.667 --> 41:37.292
- Still to come this season
on "Below Deck"...

41:37.292 --> 41:38.667
- Surprise!

41:38.667 --> 41:39.833
- Whoo!

41:39.833 --> 41:41.500
We're sorry.

41:43.333 --> 41:46.000
- I came out to my father
to this song.

41:46.000 --> 41:47.750
- Whoa, we're both gay?

41:47.750 --> 41:51.292
To me, it's weird.
Like, he felt so hurt by me.

41:51.292 --> 41:54.333
You're a queen.
- F--- off.

41:54.333 --> 41:56.875
- Emily is the jewel
of the Caribbean.

41:56.875 --> 41:58.708
- The poor connection
me or you?

41:58.708 --> 42:01.500
It's hard to manage
a full-time relationship

42:01.500 --> 42:03.500
with someone on land
in a different country.

42:05.208 --> 42:06.792
- It's a lot.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.042
- I'm really just asking
whether you think

42:08.042 --> 42:09.208
Ems and I can work out.

42:09.208 --> 42:11.000
- No.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.125
- Somebody we all know and love.

42:13.125 --> 42:15.542
- Hello, Dean.

42:15.542 --> 42:17.458
- It just didn't have--
didn't have a lot of flavor.

42:17.458 --> 42:20.208
- It's the only dish that
has ever been sent back.

42:21.875 --> 42:23.167
- I don't know
what Ben's been doing.

42:23.167 --> 42:24.375
His head is not in the game.

42:24.375 --> 42:26.375
- Kate can go
f--- herself.

42:26.375 --> 42:29.542
The root of all evil
on this boat is Kate.

42:29.542 --> 42:31.708
- Do you think we're not
working hard enough?

42:31.708 --> 42:34.000
- I'm wasted.
- Whoa.

42:34.000 --> 42:35.500
- Oh, sh--.

42:35.500 --> 42:37.917
- This is not your personal
f---ing party palace.

42:41.542 --> 42:43.167
- Do you expect her to just
stand in front of them

42:43.167 --> 42:44.708
all day long?

42:44.708 --> 42:46.083
- Kate, Ben, I can hear you guys
on the bridge.

42:46.083 --> 42:47.917
- I don't like working
with you anymore.

42:47.917 --> 42:49.500
- You know what? Guess what.
- Don't come at me. Tell me.

42:49.500 --> 42:51.417
- I can come at you
however the f--- I want.

42:51.417 --> 42:53.417
- When I leave this boat, I'm
not talking to you anymore.

42:53.417 --> 42:55.250
- Just stirring the pot.

42:55.250 --> 42:57.083
- If you don't want to go
to your happy, groovy place,

42:57.083 --> 42:58.917
you can go make beds
and clean the toilets.

42:58.917 --> 43:00.583
- God damn it!

43:00.583 --> 43:02.750
- My ass is about to be
handed to me,

43:02.750 --> 43:04.542
and it might be the last time.

43:04.542 --> 43:07.250
- What I'd like to do is
rip your f---in' head off.

43:07.250 --> 43:09.250
- Nico just got promoted
to boatswain.

43:09.250 --> 43:11.083
- What? Oh, dear.

43:12.917 --> 43:15.917
- For more "Below Deck,"
