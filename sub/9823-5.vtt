10:29.127 --> 10:30.761

10:30.796 --> 10:32.315
that could help get you outta there.

10:32.480 --> 10:35.058
I'm gonna make things right.

10:35.092 --> 10:36.960
Call me, would you?

10:57.748 --> 10:59.282
Sorry. I didn't mean to sneak up on you.

10:59.316 --> 11:00.817
[Sighs]

11:00.851 --> 11:03.120
- I just thought everyone was gone.
- Nope.

11:03.167 --> 11:04.668
I'm here late most nights.

11:04.702 --> 11:06.069
Ah.

11:06.104 --> 11:09.473
By the way, I noticed in your office...

11:09.507 --> 11:11.909
you threw away a soda can.

11:11.943 --> 11:13.911
You're going through my trash?

11:13.945 --> 11:15.345
No. [Chuckles]

11:15.380 --> 11:16.880
I was just dropping off
papers at lunchtime,

11:16.915 --> 11:18.982
and I happened to notice
it in your trash can.

11:19.017 --> 11:20.517
I fished it out, so it's fine.

11:20.551 --> 11:22.686
Office cans are for recyclable paper...

11:22.720 --> 11:24.421
there's a separate big can
in the kitchen for plastic,

11:24.455 --> 11:26.056
glass, and aluminum.

11:26.090 --> 11:28.158
We take our ecological footprint
pretty seriously here.

11:28.192 --> 11:29.826
- [Printer beeps]
- Okay, so, the big can

11:29.861 --> 11:32.496
is where I should throw
my empty Scotch bottles.

11:32.530 --> 11:34.731
[Chuckles] No, I-I get it.

11:34.766 --> 11:36.867
Go green.

11:36.901 --> 11:39.903
Good. Was there anything else?

11:39.938 --> 11:42.506
Yeah, one quick thing. I have the
brief you gave Cliff this morning...

11:42.540 --> 11:45.075
the Plaintiff's Opposition
to the Defendant's Motion?

11:45.109 --> 11:46.343
I have a few notes.

11:46.377 --> 11:48.111
I think they're pretty clear,

11:48.146 --> 11:50.580
but it's probably easier if we
just go over them together.

11:50.615 --> 11:52.082
Jesus. Th-Those are Cliff's?

11:52.116 --> 11:53.750
No, they're my notes.

11:53.785 --> 11:55.385
I'd love go to over them
now, if you have a minute.

11:55.420 --> 11:57.120
It looks worse than it is.

11:57.155 --> 11:59.423
It's... It's just that we have
a particular house style.

11:59.457 --> 12:00.924
Okay, no offense,

12:00.959 --> 12:02.926
but, uh, you're a second-year
associate, right?

12:02.961 --> 12:04.795
- Yep.
- And I came in as a fourth-year.

12:04.829 --> 12:06.363
That's right.

12:06.397 --> 12:10.467
So, why is a second-year
giving notes to a fourth-year?

12:10.501 --> 12:13.470
Well, like I said, I
know the house style.

12:14.572 --> 12:17.207
Does Cliff have you babysitting me?

12:17.241 --> 12:18.642
No.

12:18.676 --> 12:22.245
This is just one associate
helping another.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.982
Like here, the Roman numeral headings...

12:25.016 --> 12:26.583
we use all caps for those.

12:26.617 --> 12:29.119
And you indented them,
which is perfectly fine,

12:29.153 --> 12:30.754
but Cliff likes them centered.

12:30.788 --> 12:32.389
Oh, and before I forget,

12:32.423 --> 12:34.992
we put two spaces after a
period on all our documents.

12:35.026 --> 12:36.827
I know it seems like a minor thing,

12:36.861 --> 12:39.096
but really looks so much
cleaner on the page.

12:39.130 --> 12:40.831
You went a tad overboard
with the quotations.

12:40.865 --> 12:42.099
It's okay to present a quote

12:42.133 --> 12:43.433
from a controlling legal opinion,

12:43.468 --> 12:44.801
but when you use too many,

12:44.836 --> 12:46.136
it disrupts the flow of your argument,

12:46.170 --> 12:47.738
and it gives the impression

12:47.772 --> 12:49.306
you don't know how to write
an argument of your own.

12:49.340 --> 12:50.640
[Chuckling] And I'm sure you do, so...

12:50.675 --> 12:52.175
[Chuckles] You have a tendency

12:52.210 --> 12:54.611
to overuse the words
"clearly" and "obviously."

12:54.645 --> 12:56.847
Again, it's a matter
of personal opinion...

12:56.881 --> 12:59.082
I really appreciate this, Erin,

12:59.117 --> 13:01.451
but, uh, I was just on my way out.

13:01.486 --> 13:05.288
So, if we could continue this
first thing tomorrow morning...

13:05.323 --> 13:07.624
Well, I was thinking we
should just get 'er done now.

13:07.658 --> 13:08.959
No time like the present.

13:11.162 --> 13:12.763
Sure.

apply a little elbow grease.

has an image to uphold.

the Kettleman fiasco,

17:16.607 --> 17:18.275
and Chuck was nowhere in sight.

17:18.309 --> 17:20.676

33:05.393 --> 33:06.890
I'll put Francis on that.

33:07.796 --> 33:09.711
You've got enough on your
plate in doc review.

33:28.934 --> 33:31.302
[Knocking on door]

33:34.182 --> 33:35.950
Coming.

33:38.553 --> 33:39.753
Huh.

33:39.788 --> 33:41.021
Hey!

33:41.056 --> 33:42.256
HOWARD: Catch you at a bad time?

33:42.290 --> 33:45.659
Not at all. Come in.

33:45.694 --> 33:48.329
[Glass clinking]

33:48.363 --> 33:49.863
I hear clinking.

33:49.898 --> 33:53.167
Does that mean we have
something to celebrate?

33:53.201 --> 33:55.869
We sure do.

34:03.745 --> 34:06.013
What are we drinking to?

34:06.047 --> 34:08.282
Got a juicy one for you.

34:08.315 --> 34:10.617
- Mesa Verde?
- On retainer.

34:10.652 --> 34:13.353
[Chuckling] Oh, even better.

34:13.388 --> 34:14.888
[Chuckles]

34:14.922 --> 34:16.290
Congratulations.

34:16.324 --> 34:19.226
One of your golf-course conquests?

34:20.395 --> 34:22.629
Kim Wexler brought them in.

34:22.664 --> 34:24.598
Fourth-year associate snags

34:24.632 --> 34:26.967
a quarter of a million in billings?

34:27.002 --> 34:30.103
She's probably having a
couple of drinks herself.

34:30.138 --> 34:32.572
She's out of the doghouse, I assume?

34:33.641 --> 34:35.376
We'll see.

34:35.409 --> 34:37.978
Huh.

34:38.013 --> 34:39.413
Hmm.

34:39.447 --> 34:43.976
Interstate expansion...
it's a complex case.

34:44.181 --> 34:47.735
That's two, maybe three
regulatory commissions

34:47.782 --> 34:49.007
we'll be dealing with...

34:49.212 --> 34:53.047
months of work for HHM, maybe years.

35:04.127 --> 35:05.761
[Computers beeping]

[Sighs]

35:44.267 --> 35:45.834
Good morning, Rudolpho.

35:45.868 --> 35:48.637
Good morning, Mr. McGill.

36:30.313 --> 36:33.048
Oh, sorry.

36:34.150 --> 36:35.350
[Chuck sighs]

36:35.384 --> 36:37.652
I didn't know anyone was here.

36:37.687 --> 36:40.355
Just dropping off some Sandpiper stuff.

36:40.389 --> 36:41.656
You're in early.

36:41.691 --> 36:44.493
More like late. [Clears throat]

36:46.329 --> 36:49.364
Well, regardless of the
hour, good to see you here.

36:49.398 --> 36:51.466
Yeah, I'm trying something new.

36:51.501 --> 36:53.668
I'm coming in, working until 9:00.

36:53.703 --> 36:55.971
It's easier before the place opens,

36:56.005 --> 36:59.307
without all the lights
and the phones ringing.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.542
[Chuckles]

37:00.576 --> 37:02.544
How about some coffee?

37:02.578 --> 37:03.979
No, thank you.

37:04.013 --> 37:06.815
W-Would you mind making me some?

37:06.849 --> 37:08.083
I apologize.

37:08.117 --> 37:11.153
It's just I-I can't do it myself,

37:11.187 --> 37:13.755
what with the electricity.

37:15.358 --> 37:16.892
Sure. No sugar.

37:16.926 --> 37:19.494
Um, just a splash of soy milk.

37:19.529 --> 37:22.831
I think we have it.

37:22.865 --> 37:25.000
Kim?

37:25.034 --> 37:29.204
Um, make two cups.

37:42.218 --> 37:43.585
[Sniffles]

37:43.619 --> 37:46.621
Well, I guess it's true what they say...

37:46.656 --> 37:51.426

which is good if you like worms.

37:53.763 --> 37:56.565
Mm. [Sniffles]

37:59.402 --> 38:01.369
May I ask you a question?

38:01.404 --> 38:02.604
Of course.

38:02.638 --> 38:05.173
Do I have a future at this firm?

38:07.777 --> 38:09.744
We have a lot in common, you and I.

38:09.779 --> 38:11.079
[Cup thumps lightly]

38:11.113 --> 38:13.081
My brother left you holding the bag.

38:13.115 --> 38:14.950
If it makes you feel any better,

38:14.984 --> 38:18.420
you're not the first person
to go out on a limb for him.

38:18.454 --> 38:22.657
I made the same mistake
over and over again.

38:22.692 --> 38:24.793
And now Howard has...

38:24.827 --> 38:26.661
and he blames you.

38:29.265 --> 38:33.435
It's a damned mess.

38:36.372 --> 38:39.641
Jimmy ever tell you
anything about our father?

38:39.675 --> 38:40.976
Not much, no.

38:41.010 --> 38:42.577
[Sighs]

38:42.612 --> 38:48.149
My dad... our dad... he was...

38:48.184 --> 38:54.589
well... the personification of good.

38:54.624 --> 38:59.194
I'm not sure he could
even see sin in any form,

38:59.228 --> 39:02.764
like he was born without the gene.

39:02.798 --> 39:05.300
He ran a little corner
store in Cicero...

39:05.334 --> 39:08.003
cigarettes behind the
counter, penny candy...

39:08.037 --> 39:11.806
nothing special, but it
kept food on the table.

39:11.841 --> 39:14.476
And the neighborhood loved Dad.

39:14.510 --> 39:16.778
He knew everybody's name,

39:16.812 --> 39:19.648
what was going on in their lives.

39:20.850 --> 39:25.253
This little corner... he made it better.

39:28.224 --> 39:30.058
I was named after him.

39:32.495 --> 39:35.030
Before that, he'd worked for a
lot of people over the years,

39:35.064 --> 39:38.233
and his dream was to be his own boss...

39:38.267 --> 39:41.836
put everything he had into that place.

39:41.871 --> 39:46.207
I was away at college when
he put Jimmy to work there.

39:46.242 --> 39:50.278
Jimmy grew up in that
store, watching our father.

39:52.882 --> 39:56.017
But Dad was not the world's
greatest businessman,

39:56.052 --> 39:58.853
and eventually, he ran
into money troubles.

39:58.888 --> 40:01.256
I, um, had a clerkship at the time,

40:01.290 --> 40:03.658
but I came home to help him
get his books in order,

40:03.693 --> 40:05.727
set the ship straight.

40:05.761 --> 40:07.862
Now, I'm no accountant,

40:07.897 --> 40:13.168
but I discovered $14,000 was just gone,

40:13.202 --> 40:16.805
vanished over the years.

40:18.908 --> 40:22.377
Turns out Jimmy had pilfered
it in dribs and drabs...

40:22.411 --> 40:24.546
just took it out of the till.

40:27.383 --> 40:30.919
My dad wouldn't hear it.

40:30.953 --> 40:34.122
Nope. Not his Jimmy.

40:37.326 --> 40:39.928
He ended up having to sell.

40:39.962 --> 40:42.764
Six months later, he was dead.

40:42.798 --> 40:48.937
At the funeral, no one
cried harder than Jimmy.

40:52.441 --> 40:57.879
My brother is not a bad person.

40:57.913 --> 41:01.783
He has a good heart.

41:01.817 --> 41:04.152
It's just...

41:06.355 --> 41:07.922
...he can't help himself.

41:09.492 --> 41:12.761
And everyone's left
picking up the pieces.

41:16.766 --> 41:18.500
Is there any coffee left?

41:18.534 --> 41:19.768
No, I got it.

42:26.035 --> 42:28.203
Coffee... black.

42:28.237 --> 42:31.506
Coming right up.

42:31.540 --> 42:33.408
[Sighs] Mm.

42:33.442 --> 42:37.579
He really did a number on you.

42:39.682 --> 42:43.818
Sorry. I know you?

42:43.853 --> 42:45.820
The young man who did that to you.

42:45.855 --> 42:49.424
He's my nephew...
hothead, always has been.

42:49.458 --> 42:51.759
Kid thinks he's a boxer.

42:51.794 --> 42:56.764
He should have shown you respect.

42:56.799 --> 43:02.871
I apologize to you on
behalf of my family.

43:05.541 --> 43:07.842
Apology accepted.

43:07.877 --> 43:10.245
And you know what?

43:10.279 --> 43:14.349
He should go to jail...
best thing for him.

43:14.383 --> 43:17.685
Teach him respect for his elders.

43:17.720 --> 43:21.856

less, much less.

[Music continues]

43:42.645 --> 43:45.446
You see what I'm getting at?

43:45.481 --> 43:47.148
Not really.

43:47.182 --> 43:51.986
The gun charge... that's 8 years
he's going away, maybe 10.

43:52.021 --> 43:56.824
Aggravated assault, the gun,
plus he got your wallet.

43:56.859 --> 43:58.793
That's right.

[Floyd Cramer's <i> "Losers

I would like for you to tell the
police that the gun was yours.

44:06.201 --> 44:07.635
Would you?

44:07.670 --> 44:10.905
You're both a little
hot under the collar

44:10.940 --> 44:14.075
about whether you bumped his car or not.

44:14.109 --> 44:17.912
But there was a scuffle,
and, uh, he got your gun.

44:17.947 --> 44:19.314
My gun?

44:19.348 --> 44:22.150
Your gun from your pocket...

44:22.184 --> 44:26.487
he got it, and that's how
his prints got on it.

44:26.522 --> 44:29.691
And then I'd be subject
to the gun charge.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.961
You're an ex-cop.
