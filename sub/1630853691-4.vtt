00:05.000 --> 00:07.240
What woman has a beard?
You should've written mustache.

00:07.280 --> 00:08.359
I have a beard.
-No you don't.

00:08.439 --> 00:09.919
Don't say that out loud.

00:10.000 --> 00:12.560
I've decided
we're saying "mustache," okay?

00:12.919 --> 00:15.080
Except I wrote the play,
so I decide too, got it?

00:15.320 --> 00:16.920
The playwright isn't dead.
-I can see that.

00:17.000 --> 00:20.039
Then please consult with me
before you change my text. -Okay.

00:20.079 --> 00:23.440
Listen, boss,
I'm outta here by noon, okay?

00:23.559 --> 00:25.120
I don't need this bullshit,

00:25.239 --> 00:27.120
I'm not taking
this role anyway,

00:27.239 --> 00:30.039
it was just a favor until
I start rehearsals for "The Seagull."

00:30.519 --> 00:32.960
Ofer, did you...

00:33.280 --> 00:35.280
send me a dick pic?

00:36.640 --> 00:39.200
I got Nina. -What?
-Did you want the part?

00:40.119 --> 00:40.960
No...

00:41.240 --> 00:42.240
It's not about talent.

00:42.679 --> 00:46.520
Now it's oversized women,
before it was Asians, black women.

00:46.600 --> 00:47.960
It'll come back to...

00:48.039 --> 00:50.079
blondes. It's a cycle.

00:50.359 --> 00:51.679
So, you're really a couple?

00:52.079 --> 00:54.280
We were for five years...
-Not anymore. -Not anymore.

00:54.439 --> 00:57.439
You're making the biggest mistake of your life.
-Please take the next exit.

00:57.520 --> 01:00.280
You'll want me again
but I won't want you,

01:00.359 --> 01:03.240
you understand? -Got it.
-I won't wait for you. -Got it!

01:05.439 --> 01:06.640
"Let us discuss.

01:07.640 --> 01:11.959
"Let us discuss this bright
and beautiful life of mine, though.

01:13.000 --> 01:17.599
"Day and night I am held in the grip
of one besetting thought,

01:17.680 --> 01:19.040
"to write, write, write!

01:19.319 --> 01:24.959
"To prepare the honey
I feed to unknown crowds,

01:25.480 --> 01:28.959
"I am doomed to brush the bloom..."

01:29.439 --> 01:30.599
from my ass.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.239
I am doomed to brush the bloom
from my ass!

01:34.400 --> 01:35.439
Where do I brush the bloom from?

01:35.560 --> 01:37.959
"From my dearest flower!"
-Flower...

01:38.040 --> 01:40.120
"I am doomed to brush the bloom
from my dearest flower."

01:40.239 --> 01:41.439
Enough, I can't take it anymore.

01:42.239 --> 01:44.599
I'm too old
for 70-page monologues.

01:44.640 --> 01:46.040
Come on, I'm helping you.

01:46.319 --> 01:47.599
How long do you have?

01:47.640 --> 01:50.040
None.
The Austrian director is arriving today

01:50.079 --> 01:52.280
and he expects us to
be off-book.

01:52.439 --> 01:54.560
I should've learned it by now.

01:57.439 --> 01:59.120
How's it going for you guys?

01:59.480 --> 02:00.640
Why aren't you at rehearsal?

02:02.239 --> 02:03.439
I don't know...

02:04.000 --> 02:06.120
If you don't want to answer,
don't answer,

02:06.200 --> 02:07.560
what am I, your dad?

02:10.560 --> 02:12.960
Something really
embarrassing happened

02:13.039 --> 02:15.360
with that playwright...

02:15.560 --> 02:16.439
Iris.

02:16.479 --> 02:18.439
You don't know how long
you're gonna work here,

02:18.560 --> 02:20.639
that's why I told you
not to hit...

02:20.680 --> 02:22.639
No, no, no,
I didn't hit on her.

02:22.680 --> 02:24.280
Then what did you do?

02:26.360 --> 02:28.439
I sent her a picture

02:28.639 --> 02:30.199
of my dick.

02:32.560 --> 02:33.439
What?

02:35.199 --> 02:36.360
Accidentally.

02:37.639 --> 02:39.439
How do you accidentally
take a picture of your dick?

02:39.560 --> 02:43.120
I didn't take it accidentally,
I sent it accidentally.

02:43.360 --> 02:46.199
Did she ask for a picture
of your dick for costume fittings?

02:47.000 --> 02:48.639
Does he need his own costume?
-Shlomo,

02:48.680 --> 02:50.439
it was an accident!

02:50.479 --> 02:53.199
Once I accidentally called 199
instead of 911.

02:54.120 --> 02:56.199
I sent a text message,
"Shitty play," to the director

02:56.240 --> 02:58.120
instead of my wife, accidentally,

02:58.199 --> 03:00.439
but I never sent a picture
of my dick to anyone.

03:00.560 --> 03:02.120
You know why?
-Why?

03:02.199 --> 03:04.199
Because I never took
a picture of it!

03:06.479 --> 03:08.199
Why do you take pictures
of your weenie?

03:08.240 --> 03:09.639
Listen, Shlomo...

03:10.000 --> 03:12.120
it's pretty customary.
-Then it's a bad custom.

03:12.199 --> 03:13.960
I didn't mean to send it to her,
okay?

03:14.319 --> 03:15.439
I meant to send it
to someone else.

03:15.479 --> 03:17.960
Don't send it at all!
-Okay, whoa,

03:18.039 --> 03:19.400
she sent me one too.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.240
The playwright?
-No, the flight attendant.

03:22.319 --> 03:24.240
The one I wanted
to send mine to.

03:24.319 --> 03:26.439
Oh, what did she send you?
-Oh boy.

03:26.560 --> 03:28.039
You'll have a heart attack
if I tell you.

03:28.120 --> 03:30.360
Is she your girlfriend?
-Nah...

03:30.680 --> 03:33.039
She's... a friend.

03:33.439 --> 03:34.439
That's not friendship,

03:34.560 --> 03:35.960
that's organ trafficking.

03:36.039 --> 03:37.439
I'm just fooling around

03:37.520 --> 03:39.439
until the real deal comes along.

03:39.479 --> 03:41.639
I suggest that until then,
knock it off.

03:41.919 --> 03:44.199
Nowadays people lose jobs
because of that.

03:44.360 --> 03:46.240
I already did.

03:47.120 --> 03:48.960
That's why you got kicked off
of "Love Under Fire."

03:49.039 --> 03:50.199
Okay, enough.

03:50.240 --> 03:52.360
You're getting on my nerves, Shlomo.
I have rehearsal.

03:52.439 --> 03:54.520
Learn your lines,
don't slack off.

03:58.680 --> 03:59.960
"Let us discuss.

04:01.240 --> 04:04.680
"Let us discuss this bright
and beautiful life of mine, though."

04:40.199 --> 04:42.120
Tzutz, Tzutz.
-Huh?

04:42.199 --> 04:43.959
Can I ask you a question?

04:44.639 --> 04:46.120
Is it urgent?
-Yes.

04:46.399 --> 04:49.279
Well? -If you had to choose
one celebrity to marry,

04:49.360 --> 04:50.959
who would you choose?
-No, no, no,

04:51.040 --> 04:53.240
I'm not playing that.
-Come on, if you had to.

04:53.319 --> 04:55.040
I'd choose you.
-Very funny.

04:55.079 --> 04:56.959
You. -Stop it.
-Only you.

04:57.040 --> 04:59.439
I only want to be with you,
all day, all night,

04:59.560 --> 05:00.639
only you.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.240
Now leave me alone.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.240
Well?

05:05.319 --> 05:07.279
If I had to choose?
-Yes.

05:07.680 --> 05:09.439
Can it be someone abroad?
-Why abroad?

05:09.600 --> 05:11.959
See? I'm not playing.
-Fine!

05:12.160 --> 05:14.920
But to marry, not sex.
-Okay, I got it.

05:15.040 --> 05:16.399
Did she call to say
she's stuck in traffic?

05:17.360 --> 05:18.959
Tomer, are you...

05:19.040 --> 05:20.680
watching or what?

05:20.959 --> 05:22.240
No, no, I'm with you,
I'm sorry,

05:22.279 --> 05:24.240
I'm just trying to find out
where Iris is.

05:24.279 --> 05:26.079
I'm trying to get her,
don't worry.

05:26.160 --> 05:27.639
Okay, I'm continuing.
-Great.

05:31.600 --> 05:33.240
I know. Ready?

05:33.439 --> 05:35.279
Bar Refaeli.
-What?

05:35.480 --> 05:37.279
Are you and Iris a couple or...

05:37.360 --> 05:38.600
Ofer!
-Or not?

05:38.920 --> 05:41.120
Was it wrong of me to ask?
-Can't you tell they're exes?

05:41.240 --> 05:43.040
Guys, let's focus,

05:43.120 --> 05:45.240
let's get back to work.
-Okay, sorry.

05:45.680 --> 05:47.279
It's okay.
Let's go.

05:47.439 --> 05:50.279
It's her loss for leaving a guy like you.
Okay, let's go.

05:50.560 --> 05:52.360
She didn't leave me, I left her,
but thanks.

05:52.439 --> 05:54.120
You left her?
-No way.

05:54.519 --> 05:56.680
Why not? -No way.
-No way.

05:56.959 --> 05:58.920
Fine, no way, no way.
Thank you.

05:59.000 --> 06:01.040
Let's go, where we left off.
-Where we left off.

06:05.000 --> 06:07.120
I know. Ready?

06:07.240 --> 06:08.920
Bar Refaeli.
-What?

06:09.000 --> 06:10.040
Did you say Bar Refaeli?

06:10.120 --> 06:12.959
Ofer, how many times can I act
surprised? -Huge mistake!

06:13.040 --> 06:15.639
Guys, not everything in the play
really happened, okay?

06:16.040 --> 06:18.040
Never answer that kind of question.

06:18.120 --> 06:19.040
Just say, "You."

06:19.160 --> 06:21.920
I said, "You."
-So it did happen.

06:22.000 --> 06:23.040
Of course it happened.

06:23.240 --> 06:26.639
Iris likes those... games.

06:26.680 --> 06:29.120
"Who would you choose?
Who would you eat? What would you..."

06:29.240 --> 06:30.439
It always ends badly.

06:30.560 --> 06:32.079
"Who would you eat?"

06:34.160 --> 06:35.399
She asked me once,

06:36.240 --> 06:38.639
"If we were stuck in the snow,
who would you eat,

06:38.680 --> 06:40.439
"me or my mother?"

06:40.560 --> 06:42.560
I said, "Your mother,"
and that was the end of our evening.

06:44.360 --> 06:47.279
I can't believe you left her.
She's perfect for you.

06:48.279 --> 06:51.439
Okay.
-And you don't look the type...

06:51.519 --> 06:52.439
Monogamous.

06:52.519 --> 06:54.040
And Iris doesn't
look monogamous?

06:54.079 --> 06:56.079
Not as much as you.
-Come on, man.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.959
The way she carries herself...

06:59.079 --> 07:00.560
How does she carry herself?
-She's way more.

07:00.639 --> 07:03.079
She's comfortable with herself...
-All right.

07:03.160 --> 07:05.240
Thanks, guys. Got it.

07:05.439 --> 07:06.439
Text, please.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.079
Hi, excuse me,

07:13.040 --> 07:14.959
is it okay if I take the couch?

07:16.000 --> 07:17.439
To take...
What do you mean, to take it?

07:18.120 --> 07:19.680
They told me
I can take the couch.

07:20.079 --> 07:22.120
Who told you?
No, we need the couch,

07:22.240 --> 07:23.279
we need it.

07:24.319 --> 07:26.279
Okay, sorry.
-Okay.

07:33.160 --> 07:35.639
Do you know where
Vera Korkin's office is?

07:36.240 --> 07:38.279
Yes, you go down the hall

07:38.560 --> 07:42.120
and then you take the elevator
to floor number 2.

07:43.639 --> 07:45.920
Okay. Thank you.

07:51.079 --> 07:51.959
Did you see who that was?

07:52.240 --> 07:54.959
Who, the babe?
-No, that's Groshovsky.

07:55.279 --> 07:56.439
Paul Groshovsky.

07:57.240 --> 07:58.959
That's Paul Groshovsky?

07:59.680 --> 08:00.959
Paul Groshovsky.

08:01.120 --> 08:03.639
Looks like an inner-city bus driver.

08:04.480 --> 08:06.040
Guys, come on.

08:06.480 --> 08:08.279
He won the Golden Mask four times,

08:08.480 --> 08:10.399
he did "The Seagull,"
his interpretation was a masterpiece,

08:10.439 --> 08:11.680
they teach it at university.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.439
And college too.

08:14.439 --> 08:16.680
He's doing "The Seagull" here?
-Yes, Tomer, yes!

08:16.959 --> 08:18.040
He's doing "The Seagull"!

08:18.279 --> 08:20.439
Paul Groshovsky, huh?
-Paul Groshovsky.

08:22.079 --> 08:23.199
It's common knowledge.

08:25.319 --> 08:28.680
Okay, you guys do...
I'll be right back.

08:29.360 --> 08:30.439
Do what?
-The text.

08:31.279 --> 08:32.639
Do it again...

08:32.679 --> 08:34.559
From the top.
Sarel, from the top.

08:35.159 --> 08:36.440
Okay.

08:37.960 --> 08:40.639
From the top, from "Bar Refaeli."

08:40.679 --> 08:43.440
No way, I'm not acting
without a director.

08:43.480 --> 08:45.240
What do you take me for?
-Please.

08:45.279 --> 08:47.960
No way, boss, forget it.

08:51.320 --> 08:52.360
Excuse me.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.519
The subscriber you have dialed
is not available...

08:58.240 --> 08:59.600
Are you coming in today?

09:00.120 --> 09:02.360
Call me back, let me know.

09:02.440 --> 09:03.279
Oh, listen,

09:03.639 --> 09:05.559
Paul Groshovsky is here.

09:05.639 --> 09:08.279
Paul Groshovsky is here,
rehearsing in the room next door.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.039
He's the one
who's directing....

09:11.320 --> 09:13.639
Anyway, call me back,
I'll tell you all about it.

09:21.240 --> 09:23.279
I promise it won't take long.

09:24.480 --> 09:26.600
But can you tell me
what we're doing?

09:26.639 --> 09:28.919
I told you, I want to scream.

09:29.279 --> 09:30.639
I need somewhere to yell.
-Right,

09:30.919 --> 09:32.279
but I don't get it.

09:34.039 --> 09:36.039
Is it okay that
you're not at the theater?

09:36.559 --> 09:38.039
Gili, I'm not okay.

09:38.960 --> 09:41.240
I'm not okay.
-You look okay.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.600
Do you want to go
to the hospital?

09:43.679 --> 09:46.399
No, I just want to scream.

09:47.960 --> 09:50.120
Okay, where should I go?

09:51.080 --> 09:52.919
I envisioned a desert.

09:53.399 --> 09:56.200
Then envision somewhere closer,

09:56.240 --> 09:58.919
I have to pick up Neta
from daycare at four.

10:10.679 --> 10:12.440
Are you coming in today?

10:18.240 --> 10:22.039
No, it's contagious, it's gross, no.
-Oh, please.

10:22.159 --> 10:24.559
I'll tell Raz to bring you a bottle.
-Raz?

10:27.240 --> 10:29.120
Didn't you say we were
getting a bite to eat?

10:29.200 --> 10:32.279
Afterwards. First she'll yell,
then we'll eat.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.600
Did your therapist recommend this?

10:37.080 --> 10:39.120
No, I read about it,
I need to vent out anger,

10:39.200 --> 10:43.279
I need to release,
-What does she need? -Release.

10:44.360 --> 10:46.080
Why are you angry?

10:47.159 --> 10:48.919
Because Tomer left me.

10:49.519 --> 10:50.960
What?

10:51.639 --> 10:54.440
Why did he leave you?
-I don't know.

10:55.159 --> 10:57.440
Gili, I want
a wide open space, okay?

10:57.480 --> 10:59.440
No echo, so I don't scream
back at myself.

10:59.519 --> 11:02.440
Not a valley or something.
-Okay, no valley.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.960
What are you doing with the Waze?
-Looking for wide open spaces.

11:07.039 --> 11:09.639
Go straight.
-But why did he leave you?

11:09.960 --> 11:12.279
What about over there?
Go in between the trees,

11:12.320 --> 11:14.440
we'll wait for you here,
end of story.

11:14.519 --> 11:16.279
No, no, not here.

11:16.360 --> 11:18.279
Go straight.
-But why did he leave you?

11:18.399 --> 11:20.279
You don't know why?
-I don't know, Razi,

11:20.360 --> 11:22.559
I don't know why he left me.

11:23.399 --> 11:24.639
But why...

11:25.120 --> 11:26.279
But why didn't he tell me?

11:26.399 --> 11:27.639
Why should he tell you?

11:27.679 --> 11:29.200
You don't...

11:29.279 --> 11:31.559
You don't do that,
why did he leave you?

11:31.639 --> 11:33.240
It happens, brother.

11:33.279 --> 11:35.960
He left her.
-Okay, but why?

11:36.399 --> 11:38.399
What...
-I don't know why,

11:38.440 --> 11:40.440
I don't know why he left me, Razi.

11:40.559 --> 11:42.360
Did you do something to him?
-I didn't do anything.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.639
Then why did he leave you?
-Gili,

11:44.679 --> 11:47.519
help me out here.
-Razi, stop asking why.

11:47.600 --> 11:50.039
Because he had enough.

11:50.240 --> 11:53.120
I understand he had enough,
but why?

11:55.039 --> 11:56.919
I'll call and ask him.
-You better not!

11:57.000 --> 11:59.240
No. -You better not!
-Razi, don't. -Do not call him.

11:59.279 --> 12:01.440
Razi! -Do not call him.
-I had...

12:01.480 --> 12:02.440
Put it away.
-Razi, stop it.

12:02.480 --> 12:03.639
She did something to him.
-No I didn't.

12:03.679 --> 12:05.279
I'm telling you.
-I didn't do anything.

12:05.399 --> 12:06.639
What did I do?
-Then why did he leave you?

12:06.679 --> 12:08.240
Come on, brother, it happens.

12:08.279 --> 12:09.559
Why did Mom leave Dad?

12:09.679 --> 12:11.679
What kind of example is that?
-I don't know.

12:11.960 --> 12:13.960
It's not the same.
-I think it was a mistake.

12:14.039 --> 12:16.360
She made a mistake
and now she's all alone,

12:16.440 --> 12:17.399
she should go back to him.

12:17.440 --> 12:19.279
Great, let's arrange
a surprise date for them,

12:19.320 --> 12:20.919
maybe they'll get back together
after 25 years.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.440
Is it because Tomer didn't love her?

12:22.559 --> 12:24.279
He does love me.
He does love me.

12:24.360 --> 12:28.240
Then why did he leave you?
-Razi, leave her alone! Enough!

12:29.320 --> 12:30.639
Okay?

12:48.519 --> 12:50.399
When's your wedding?

12:50.440 --> 12:52.039
Sorry, guys,
but let's rehearse the text.

12:52.080 --> 12:53.960
Wait a sec.
-We're wasting time.

12:54.159 --> 12:55.440
In a month.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.919
Reut's a great guy.
-He is.

13:00.080 --> 13:01.679
Even though he has a girl's name.

13:04.440 --> 13:05.519
I want that too.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.919
I swear, I really do.

13:08.320 --> 13:09.519
To get married?

13:09.919 --> 13:12.360
The whole...

13:13.200 --> 13:14.519
long-time girlfriend thing,

13:14.600 --> 13:17.360
someone who'll ask me
dumb questions on the couch.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.639
But we have to be
good friends too.

13:22.080 --> 13:23.679
Why don't you
introduce me to one of your friends?

13:24.320 --> 13:25.600
Oh please, Ofer.

13:25.639 --> 13:29.360
But someone serious. -You think
I'd introduce you to one of my friends?

13:29.440 --> 13:30.440
Why not?

13:30.559 --> 13:32.039
Don't you know
you're a public toilet?

13:34.039 --> 13:35.039
What?

13:35.279 --> 13:38.279
I'm crazy about you, but you...

13:40.919 --> 13:43.200
You go through girls
like socks.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.279
What?

13:45.399 --> 13:47.399
When did you have a girlfriend
for more than a week?

13:47.440 --> 13:50.279
Your mama's a public toilet,
you dumb model!

13:50.440 --> 13:52.399
Chill.
-Your mama's a public toilet!

13:52.559 --> 13:55.279
Ofer... -You know why you
didn't get "Nina"?

13:55.320 --> 13:57.679
'Cause everyone knows you're
a dumb model. -Shut up!

13:57.960 --> 14:00.080
You couldn't take on
a part like that.

14:00.240 --> 14:01.639
Shlomo says so,
everyone says so!

14:01.919 --> 14:04.120
Why don't you send a dick pic
to a few other girls?

14:04.240 --> 14:06.919
How many girls were you with on the set
before they fired you?

14:07.000 --> 14:09.440
They didn't fire me,
and they'll bring me back, in your face!

14:09.480 --> 14:11.080
Not a chance, you asshole!

14:17.000 --> 14:18.080
What's up, guys?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.440
Did you rehearse the scene?

14:22.639 --> 14:25.440
Huh? Were you rehearsing?

14:26.440 --> 14:27.559
Sarel.
-Uh...

14:28.000 --> 14:29.639
I asked you guys to rehearse.
-Yeah...

14:29.679 --> 14:31.080
It wasn't a break.
-Yeah.

14:31.159 --> 14:32.679
If I step out for a sec...

14:33.200 --> 14:34.279
Yeah, it's just...
-This is not okay.

14:34.399 --> 14:36.919
We can't work like this.
Okay, let's do the text.

14:38.559 --> 14:39.639
Let's go. Text.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.440
From where we left off.

14:43.120 --> 14:45.639
Would you mind
if I asked why Bar Refaeli?

14:45.679 --> 14:48.960
She intrigues me.
-She intrigues you?

14:49.039 --> 14:50.960
What has she said lately that...

14:51.039 --> 14:52.240
arouses your curiosity?

14:52.279 --> 14:54.279
I didn't say arouses.
Did I say arouses?

14:54.360 --> 14:56.440
I'd rather you say arouses.
Intrigues?

14:56.639 --> 15:01.200
Prof. Ada Yonath is intriguing,
it's intriguing to hear what she has to say,

15:01.240 --> 15:02.279
but Bar Refaeli?

15:02.320 --> 15:03.440
Great energy, Maya.

15:04.080 --> 15:06.200
Who would you choose?
-That's irrelevant.

15:06.360 --> 15:09.240
Because you're so deep, right?
So let's hear who you'd choose.

15:09.399 --> 15:11.919
Who, David Frost?
-Great, Ofer! -No!

15:12.000 --> 15:15.960
Why not?
You could talk about art, about history,

15:16.039 --> 15:18.279
about fuck knows!
Does it matter what he looks like?

15:18.320 --> 15:19.639
You're so shallow!
-You're shallow!

15:19.679 --> 15:20.960
You're shallow!
-You're shallow!

15:21.120 --> 15:23.440
Text! -"You're shallow,
what do you know about Bar Refaeli?"

15:23.559 --> 15:24.440
That's it, not the whole play.

15:24.519 --> 15:26.279
You're shallow,
what do you know about Bar Refaeli?

15:26.360 --> 15:28.279
Fuck, I keep forgetting
my lines here.

15:28.399 --> 15:30.360
All right, let's stop for a second,
it's okay.

15:30.919 --> 15:32.440
Yes, Itzik, hi.

15:33.000 --> 15:34.039
Now that you're on a break,

15:34.679 --> 15:38.279
I gotta take the couch.
I gotta. Stas.

15:38.399 --> 15:39.279
Wait, no...

15:41.000 --> 15:42.440
Itzik, I'm working with the couch,

15:42.559 --> 15:43.679
I need the couch.
-I know, buddy,

15:43.960 --> 15:45.960
but what can I do?
The Austrian director,

15:46.519 --> 15:47.440
he needs a couch.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.279
I gotta take it.
I'm sorry.

15:51.679 --> 15:54.200
You guys really have
something here...

15:54.440 --> 15:56.960
What?
-Something good. Funny.

15:57.240 --> 15:58.080
Yeah?

15:59.159 --> 16:00.960
Why is he so mad?

16:01.279 --> 16:03.639
Itzik, can I get another couch?

16:04.639 --> 16:06.200
No, but listen, I...

16:07.279 --> 16:09.039
How can I work without a couch?

16:09.240 --> 16:10.279
What can I do?

16:11.480 --> 16:12.519
Here's a couch.

16:14.639 --> 16:15.679
Couch.

16:17.200 --> 16:20.639
Okay, no big deal,
we'll work with chairs.

16:20.679 --> 16:23.080
No, no, no,
I'm not working with plastic chairs,

16:23.159 --> 16:24.919
I'm done.

16:25.000 --> 16:25.960
I'm calling my agent

16:26.039 --> 16:27.600
to tell her
I'm getting treated like shit.

16:28.200 --> 16:30.279
Why should we work
without a couch?

16:30.399 --> 16:31.960
Why without a couch?

16:32.159 --> 16:33.440
What, we don't need a couch?

16:56.240 --> 16:58.360
What a serious face.
-I want you to tell me

16:58.440 --> 17:00.440
if I'm capable of playing
a dramatic lead role

17:00.480 --> 17:02.440
or do you think I'm just a model.
-What happened?

17:03.120 --> 17:04.960
Why didn't you let me play Nina?

17:05.160 --> 17:07.279
Because Groshovsky wanted Alma,
what do you want from me?

17:07.400 --> 17:10.279
I want to know the truth.
-You do? -Yes.

17:11.359 --> 17:14.279
You're not ready
for a dramatic lead role.

17:17.640 --> 17:21.519
Why not?
-You're too pretty, you're not ugly. -What?

17:22.039 --> 17:25.039
So pretty actresses
can't play complex roles?

17:25.119 --> 17:27.279
I can do ugly,
put in some fake teeth.

17:27.559 --> 17:31.240
Anyone can get dressed up
as ugly,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.039
the point is to be ugly.
-I don't understand what you want.

17:34.119 --> 17:36.200
I can be ugly, Vera, you know me.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.279
No, sweetie,
you can be annoying.

17:38.480 --> 17:40.920
You refuse to be ugly.
-What?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.640
You're young and pretty
and you've got money

17:43.680 --> 17:47.279
and whatever you want,
you get it on the spot.

17:47.319 --> 17:49.240
And that's good for life,
but not...

17:50.279 --> 17:51.359
not for drama.

17:52.480 --> 17:53.440
Mayuchka,

17:53.559 --> 17:56.640
you need to go through
a few more things in life, that's all.

17:56.920 --> 17:58.240
How do you know what I've...

17:59.279 --> 18:00.119
What?

18:00.240 --> 18:02.680
Do you know I grew up
in a very tough environment?

18:03.200 --> 18:06.119
My parents were constantly fighting
and they nearly got divorced.

18:06.200 --> 18:08.440
Do you know
that if my father came home

18:08.519 --> 18:11.440
and there wasn't a hot meal waiting for him,
he'd take my mother

18:11.559 --> 18:14.039
outside to stand in the snow?
-Come on, Vera.

18:14.599 --> 18:17.680
I'm not gonna tell you about
the bullying I went through in high school

18:17.960 --> 18:19.920
because all the girls
were jealous of me.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.920
Then I won't tell you about
being called "dirty Jew" in the street

18:23.000 --> 18:25.400
and having a swastika drawn on my bag.
-We're not competing.

18:29.279 --> 18:30.640
And if you think
that in order to play Medea

18:30.680 --> 18:32.599
an actress has to murder her kids,

18:33.039 --> 18:34.640
then you don't understand
what acting is.

18:34.680 --> 18:38.039
But don't you think that actress
should at least be a mother?

18:38.359 --> 18:40.640
Feel in her body what it means.

18:41.400 --> 18:44.960
So get married,
get pregnant, have a baby.

18:46.240 --> 18:49.279
Feel real pain for the first time,

18:49.359 --> 18:53.240
when your body is being torn apart
and no one can help you.

18:53.279 --> 18:55.359
And a human being
comes out of your body

18:55.440 --> 18:58.279
who turns your life into a prison,
but is also...

18:58.319 --> 18:59.599
your most precious thing

18:59.640 --> 19:01.240
and all you want

19:01.279 --> 19:02.279
is for someone to promise you

19:02.319 --> 19:04.440
that you'll die before him.

19:05.279 --> 19:10.039
Mayuchka, an actor that doesn't truly
live life, take risks and gets dirty

19:10.119 --> 19:11.400
is a dead actor.

19:12.079 --> 19:15.240
So take it easy,
it's all good.

19:23.640 --> 19:25.599
Listen, they took my couch,
I don't have a couch.

19:25.640 --> 19:28.640
I can't work.
Too bad you're not here.

19:28.680 --> 19:30.039
Talk to me.

19:41.640 --> 19:43.440
What sensations
does being famous give you?

19:45.079 --> 19:46.960
What sensations? None.

19:47.559 --> 19:49.279
I don't believe it gives any.

19:49.519 --> 19:53.440
Either you exaggerate my fame, or else,

19:54.160 --> 19:55.680
if it exists, all I can say

19:56.039 --> 19:58.359
is that one simply doesn't
feel fame in any way.

19:58.440 --> 20:01.039
But when you read about yourself
in the papers?

20:01.440 --> 20:03.119
If the critics praise me, I am happy,

20:04.079 --> 20:06.119
if they condemn me, I...

20:08.960 --> 20:10.240
I'm a huge fan.

20:12.200 --> 20:14.119
He doesn't speak English, so...

20:14.960 --> 20:16.279
He's a fan of yours.

20:18.279 --> 20:19.400
Thank you.

20:20.519 --> 20:23.119
Was that so urgent to say right now?

20:25.440 --> 20:29.279
I'm sorry,
but I need the couch that...

20:29.599 --> 20:31.279
that you're sitting on.
-What?

20:33.279 --> 20:35.200
He needs the couch
we're sitting on.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.240
You know, this is my couch,
I told you not to take it,

20:38.279 --> 20:42.240
so you went behind my back
and you took it. -No, I asked for a couch,

20:42.559 --> 20:45.279
not your couch,
and this is just what they gave me.

20:45.400 --> 20:46.680
Hey, Kasha,

20:47.160 --> 20:49.039
I don't understand
what's going on.

20:49.200 --> 20:51.279
He's directing a play
in the small auditorium,

20:51.400 --> 20:53.039
this is the couch
for his rehearsals.

20:53.079 --> 20:55.599
Why did they take away
his couch?

20:57.359 --> 20:59.240
Because you asked
to sit on a couch.

20:59.640 --> 21:03.200
I asked for a couch!

21:03.440 --> 21:06.960
Not to mess up another director's rehearsal.
-I'm sorry if...

21:07.319 --> 21:08.240
Where is Vera?

21:09.599 --> 21:10.960
Bring Vera here.

21:11.200 --> 21:12.680
Bring Vera here!

21:14.079 --> 21:18.039
What's going on in this theater?

21:20.920 --> 21:22.400
We didn't ask for a helicopter.

21:22.559 --> 21:23.960
I understand, thank you.

21:24.079 --> 21:26.680
All we asked for is a couch!

21:28.400 --> 21:33.240
For that, a young director
has to stop his rehearsal

21:33.279 --> 21:36.079
and make a scandal during mine?

21:36.519 --> 21:40.279
Really, Vera,
just take the damn couch.

21:40.640 --> 21:43.440
Keep the couch, don't worry,
I'll give him something else.

21:43.519 --> 21:45.240
She'll get him another couch.

21:45.279 --> 21:48.240
Suddenly there's another couch?!

21:50.200 --> 21:52.960
Take the couch.
Take the couch, you okay.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.440
Yes, continue, please, Nina.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.359
What about here?

22:10.440 --> 22:12.200
Gili, stop asking me
every second.

22:12.240 --> 22:13.640
If you're not up to it,
just go home.

22:13.920 --> 22:16.519
Don't take your nerves out
on me, sis.

22:17.079 --> 22:19.279
What now?
Iris, wait for him.

22:20.119 --> 22:21.359
Gili, just go back to the car,

22:21.440 --> 22:23.119
I want to scream by myself.

22:23.200 --> 22:25.640
What if there are snakes here?
No way.

22:25.960 --> 22:27.119
Gili.
-What?

22:27.279 --> 22:29.680
Are girls allowed
to recite the Mourner's Prayer?

22:30.039 --> 22:31.440
I don't think so.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.960
Then no one will recite it for you,
'cause you only have girls.

22:35.079 --> 22:38.119
Why would anyone be reciting it now?
-Not now, but when the time comes,

22:38.240 --> 22:39.960
there won't be anyone to recite it.

22:40.039 --> 22:42.440
Don't worry, I'll manage.
Would you do me a favor?

22:42.480 --> 22:44.039
No, I want you
to go back to the car.

22:44.440 --> 22:46.440
We're not going back to the car.

22:47.000 --> 22:50.440
You may not care, but I really want
someone to recite it for me.

22:50.519 --> 22:52.599
If you don't have a boy,
I'll recite it for you.

22:52.640 --> 22:54.119
You can't, you're a woman,

22:54.240 --> 22:55.599
and you may not have a boy either.

22:55.640 --> 22:57.960
I'll say it for you, okay?
You have my word.

22:58.039 --> 22:59.440
Your word?

22:59.480 --> 23:01.079
You said you were gonna be
a surfer in Hawaii,

23:01.160 --> 23:03.240
you're a geography teacher
in the suburbs!

23:04.279 --> 23:05.920
You're gonna yell right here,
right here.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.119
I'm sorry.
-No sorry.

23:07.240 --> 23:08.240
Go yell.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.119
I don't have all day
to feel sorry for you. Yell.

23:11.440 --> 23:13.079
Go yell.

23:20.039 --> 23:21.279
That's why he left her.

23:42.960 --> 23:44.119
Never mind.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.640
What happened?
-I couldn't do it.

23:47.559 --> 23:50.960
It doesn't matter.
-Come here. Wait.

24:36.000 --> 24:37.119
Come on.

24:42.960 --> 24:43.960
Iris, I yelled.

24:45.920 --> 24:47.039
Good job, Razi.

24:50.039 --> 24:51.200
I yelled too.

24:59.039 --> 24:59.920
What's going on?

25:00.559 --> 25:01.400
Careful.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.279
Ofer, are you going over your lines?

25:10.240 --> 25:12.119
Yeah, listen, Tomer, I'm...

25:12.640 --> 25:14.920
I'm sorry about...
-It's fine.

25:15.440 --> 25:17.960
Really, it's all good. Thanks.
-No problem.

25:18.039 --> 25:19.039
Um...

25:20.039 --> 25:23.119
Wanna go sit and talk about
the character after rehearsal today?

25:23.200 --> 25:26.279
Yeah, I can't, I'm meeting this girl...

25:26.519 --> 25:27.440
Oh...

25:27.599 --> 25:29.640
No, no, no, not at all.

25:30.039 --> 25:31.279
It's not what you think.

25:31.680 --> 25:33.279
Ask me who I'd choose.

25:33.519 --> 25:36.559
I don't get it.
-Ask me who I'd choose to marry. -Oh.

25:37.039 --> 25:39.359
If you had to choose a celebrity,
blah, blah, blah,

25:39.440 --> 25:40.279
who would you choose?

25:40.559 --> 25:41.440
Iris.

25:43.319 --> 25:45.440
Iris who?
-Yeah, yeah, Iris.

25:45.559 --> 25:47.519
Iris?
She's not a celebrity.

25:47.599 --> 25:49.400
I know.
Iris as a metaphor.

25:50.279 --> 25:52.519
Okay, as a metaphor...
she's great.

25:53.119 --> 25:55.079
You understand what I'm saying?
'Cause I'm having

25:55.160 --> 25:56.279
a hard time explaining myself.

25:56.400 --> 25:57.960
Mr. Director.

25:58.480 --> 26:00.039
Don't talk, just listen.

26:00.640 --> 26:02.279
You.
You know what you are?

26:03.119 --> 26:04.240
You're a raisin,

26:04.319 --> 26:05.960
but with the ego
of a watermelon.

26:06.160 --> 26:07.599
You don't exist yet.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.680
You haven't earned the right
to walk around

26:09.960 --> 26:12.920
and cause scandals here, understand?
-Yes... -Good, good.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.960
You have your couch now?
Then there's no reason

26:15.039 --> 26:16.440
your play shouldn't be
a masterpiece.

26:16.920 --> 26:19.440
I'll come next week to see a run-through,
we'll see what you've got.

26:19.599 --> 26:21.119
Where's Iris? Not here?
-No.

26:21.240 --> 26:22.039
Good.

26:22.079 --> 26:23.359
A playwright at rehearsals

26:23.440 --> 26:25.440
is like a whore
staying for breakfast.

26:27.039 --> 26:28.039
Good luck!

26:29.119 --> 26:30.279
To everyone.

26:37.039 --> 26:39.079
Okay, I think that's it for today.

26:43.119 --> 26:45.920
That's it?
-Yeah. I think so.

27:05.079 --> 27:06.440
Hi.
-Hi.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.599
Do you mind if I go in first?
I just really need to...

27:17.079 --> 27:18.640
Unless...
How much do you need?

27:18.680 --> 27:21.640
No, no problem.
-Thank you.

27:22.640 --> 27:24.119
I'll only be a second.

27:26.519 --> 27:28.440
I'll also only be a second,
you know,

27:28.599 --> 27:30.680
I wasn't planning on
taking a shower in there.

27:31.920 --> 27:33.440
So you agree and then
you change your mind?

27:33.519 --> 27:35.039
Okay, it's fine,
you can go in first,

27:35.160 --> 27:36.359
never mind.

27:39.039 --> 27:41.200
Every interaction with you
is just

27:41.240 --> 27:42.960
so much fun.

27:43.039 --> 27:45.240
To ask for the couch
and then to take it anyway

27:45.279 --> 27:46.960
after I told you
you can't take it.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.440
I told you
you can't take the couch.

27:48.920 --> 27:50.119
That's great, thank you.

27:54.039 --> 27:55.559
Did you check
if there's someone inside?

27:56.640 --> 27:59.240
There is.
You can see that it's red.

28:00.119 --> 28:01.279
Okay.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.519
So this is Israel, okay?
The lock is probably broken. -Oh.

28:05.079 --> 28:07.559
It's been red for a year, okay?
There's nobody inside. -Yes.

28:08.640 --> 28:10.440
No! No!

28:19.000 --> 28:21.240
Yeah. I think there's somebody inside.
-Yes, there's somebody inside. -Yeah.

28:33.640 --> 28:36.640
I can actually go pee outside,
I just...

28:37.000 --> 28:39.960
I'm curious, I want to see
who's the guy that's shouting

28:40.039 --> 28:42.240
So you can stay.
-Yeah.

28:44.279 --> 28:45.680
I don't know, it's...

28:46.640 --> 28:48.039
I...

28:48.680 --> 28:50.039
I think...

28:50.559 --> 28:52.599
I think I will go pee outside.
-Okay.

28:54.599 --> 28:56.240
So...

28:56.400 --> 28:58.960
if you can tell me some other time
what he looks like.

28:59.279 --> 29:00.400
Okay.
-Okay.

29:11.519 --> 29:12.440
Hello?

29:12.559 --> 29:14.920
Tomer.
-What's up, Razi?

29:15.039 --> 29:16.559
You don't do that.

29:17.279 --> 29:18.200
What? Where are you?

29:18.240 --> 29:19.680
She's not okay, you know?

29:19.960 --> 29:21.599
She's not okay.
-Razi, where are you?

29:21.640 --> 29:24.440
I wanted to talk to you.
-Tomer, it's not okay.

29:38.119 --> 29:41.279
The subscriber you have dialed
is not available...

29:51.240 --> 29:52.240
Iris!

29:55.480 --> 29:56.440
Iris!

29:59.599 --> 30:00.519
What's wrong with you?

30:01.000 --> 30:01.960
You're not answering.

30:02.119 --> 30:03.279
I was in the shower,
are you nuts?

30:05.359 --> 30:06.279
What are you doing here?

30:07.680 --> 30:10.519
I came to get a few things.
May I?

30:11.279 --> 30:12.279
Yeah.

30:22.279 --> 30:25.200
Anything specific?

30:25.240 --> 30:27.640
My coat, the nice one.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.119
In the box.

30:30.319 --> 30:31.559
You packed a box for me?

30:35.599 --> 30:37.079
Take the whole box.
-What?

30:37.319 --> 30:38.640
I can't, I'm on my bike.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.440
You came to get your things
on your bike?

30:40.519 --> 30:43.440
I didn't come to get my things,
I came to get my coat.

30:49.359 --> 30:50.960
You really gotta pay that.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.960
They'll cut off your electricity.

30:53.279 --> 30:56.359
Don't I get alimony or
some kind of break-up fine?

30:56.440 --> 30:59.640
No, I don't think so.
-Too bad, there should be.

31:00.640 --> 31:01.640
Okay.

31:04.160 --> 31:05.240
I'll be going.

31:05.359 --> 31:06.960
Next time,
let me know when you're coming.

31:07.119 --> 31:09.279
Okay.
You don't answer your phone.

31:09.319 --> 31:10.440
I wasn't at home.

31:11.119 --> 31:13.039
What are all these messages?
-Are you coming in today?

31:13.240 --> 31:14.599
That's just...
-Call me back,

31:15.359 --> 31:17.039
let me know.
-That's just...

31:17.160 --> 31:19.680
Paul Groshovsky is here.
Paul Groshovsky...

31:20.519 --> 31:22.400
Listen, they took my couch...
-What is this?

31:22.440 --> 31:24.039
It's nothing, it's irrelevant.
-I can't work.

31:24.119 --> 31:27.039
Too bad you're not here.
Talk to me.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.920
I don't understand
why you're not answering,

31:29.000 --> 31:30.960
and Razi just called me...
-There's...

31:31.039 --> 31:32.960
I don't know what to think...
-What is this?

31:33.039 --> 31:34.119
I just hope you're...

31:34.440 --> 31:35.640
I'm on my way.
-What's come over you?

31:35.920 --> 31:38.640
Okay, I was worried.
I'm allowed to worry, big deal.

31:39.119 --> 31:41.119
It's not like you
not to answer all day,

31:41.240 --> 31:42.039
Razi called

31:42.119 --> 31:43.920
and I didn't know
what was happening with you.

31:44.000 --> 31:45.440
What could possibly
happen to me?

31:45.559 --> 31:48.119
Maybe you're sick,
maybe you're... I don't know.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.240
You didn't show up.

31:52.920 --> 31:56.960
Did you think
I hurt myself?

31:58.279 --> 32:00.559
Admit that
that's what you thought.

32:00.599 --> 32:04.079
Admit that you thought
I may have killed myself because of you.

32:04.160 --> 32:07.200
That you'd come in here
and see me...

32:07.240 --> 32:11.680
hanging from the ceiling.
Isn't that what you thought?

32:13.480 --> 32:15.200
I don't believe it.

32:15.519 --> 32:17.400
What a narcissistic...

32:18.160 --> 32:21.039
What a narcissistic moron!

32:21.079 --> 32:23.279
You listen to me.
-I get it. -No, you don't get it.

32:23.319 --> 32:24.640
I get it, I get it.
-No, listen, this is important,

32:24.960 --> 32:27.559
not only will I not kill myself,
I'll kill you first.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.559
Your life is in danger, not mine.
-Great.

32:30.640 --> 32:32.960
So if everyone's okay,
everyone's alive,

32:34.079 --> 32:35.039
I'll be going.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.279
Why did you come here?
-Tzutz.

32:37.319 --> 32:40.039
Don't call me Tzutz,
why did you come here?

32:40.119 --> 32:42.440
Do you realize how much strength
it takes to let you go now?

32:44.559 --> 32:46.119
How badly I want to
take off this robe?

32:46.240 --> 32:47.440
Don't take it off.
-But I want to take it off.

32:47.559 --> 32:49.279
Don't take it off.
-But I want to take it off.

32:49.640 --> 32:51.200
Don't take it off.

32:52.160 --> 32:53.279
What do you choose?

32:54.000 --> 32:56.200
To never come here again

32:56.240 --> 32:57.960
or for me to take off my robe?

33:02.319 --> 33:03.960
I don't want to choose.

33:06.640 --> 33:08.519
I really do need you
to die a little.

33:09.000 --> 33:11.200
Don't worry, I will.
-Then hurry up.
