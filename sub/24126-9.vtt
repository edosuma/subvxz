WEBVTT

00:00.291 --> 00:03.333
I gotta get goin'

00:03.333 --> 00:06.875
a friend of mine

00:08.500 --> 00:11.333
he's just Pooh Bear

00:13.958 --> 00:17.458
chasin' some honeybees

00:17.458 --> 00:20.875
I know he's out there

00:24.458 --> 00:28.000
we're so adventurous

00:28.000 --> 00:31.166
and again

00:31.166 --> 00:34.833
and there's nobody home

00:34.833 --> 00:38.250
to count on a friend

00:38.250 --> 00:41.708
Winnie the Pooh Bear

00:43.833 --> 00:45.250
take me, please?

00:45.250 --> 00:48.708
I got to be there

00:50.708 --> 00:55.875
Winnie the Pooh

01:07.875 --> 01:10.000
Don't stop now.

01:10.000 --> 01:12.250
We're almost finished.

01:12.250 --> 01:14.708
Whew. It sure took
long enough

01:14.708 --> 01:16.708
to dig this whatchamahoosie.

01:16.708 --> 01:20.958
Ooh. I thought you said
this, uh, whatchamahoosie

01:20.958 --> 01:23.416
was going to save work,
Rabbit.

01:23.416 --> 01:25.083
Oh, dear.

01:26.583 --> 01:31.083
This ditch is part of my new
scientific farming method.

01:31.083 --> 01:32.958
Once it's filled with water,

01:32.958 --> 01:35.833
It will keep my carrots
moist and happy

01:35.833 --> 01:38.083
all summer long.

01:38.083 --> 01:40.750
What's the big idea,
sonny?

01:40.750 --> 01:43.291
If I hadn't filled in
that big ditch,

01:43.291 --> 01:47.125
you'd have water kersplashing
all over your garden.

01:47.125 --> 01:48.458
Filled in?

01:48.458 --> 01:49.875
By dinghy,

01:49.875 --> 01:52.125
you've nearly ruined
the work of a lifetime.

01:52.125 --> 01:53.833
Now see here, Gopher,

01:53.833 --> 01:55.750
just what do you think
you're doing?

01:55.750 --> 02:00.583
Well, first I got to set up
my construction site.

02:00.583 --> 02:01.958
Then I got
to take a survey--

02:01.958 --> 02:03.250
Uh, but--

02:03.250 --> 02:06.833
You fellas can help me,
too, if you like.

02:06.833 --> 02:11.416
Careful. This blackboard's
been in the family for years.

02:11.416 --> 02:14.000
Oh, it's beautiful, Gopher,

02:14.000 --> 02:16.083
with just he right
amount of chalk.

02:16.083 --> 02:18.750
This here equation
was handed down

02:18.750 --> 02:22.250
from my grandpappy
to my pappy to me.

02:22.250 --> 02:26.750
Boys, you're eyeballing
a real wonder of the world:

02:26.750 --> 02:30.583
an equation for...
the ultimate tunnel.

02:30.583 --> 02:34.458
And to think it looked like
just a bunch of numbers to me.

02:34.458 --> 02:36.375
No, siree.

02:36.375 --> 02:39.208
These are more
than just numbers.

02:40.625 --> 02:43.125
Gopher, narrating:
My grandpappy was always

02:43.125 --> 02:45.625
an overeager young
whippersnapper,

02:45.625 --> 02:49.833
and one day
he accidentally tunneled
into the Grand Canyon.

02:51.416 --> 02:54.583
Ever since
that fateful afternoon,

02:54.583 --> 02:58.583
he dreamed of digging
the ultimate tunnel.

03:00.166 --> 03:04.333
I'm going to make
my ancestor's dream a reality.

03:04.333 --> 03:06.416
That's wonderful, Gopher,

03:06.416 --> 03:10.708
but just where will this
ultimate tunnel begin?

03:10.708 --> 03:12.000
Follow me.

03:16.708 --> 03:19.500
Congratulations,
Rabbit.

03:19.500 --> 03:23.333
My ultimate tunnel
starts right here.

03:23.333 --> 03:24.875
You lucky guy.

03:24.875 --> 03:26.458
Yep. Heh heh heh heh.

03:26.458 --> 03:27.500
Ain't it wonderful?

03:27.500 --> 03:29.250
But-- But-- But-- But--

03:29.250 --> 03:31.875
I know it's a big job,
Rabbit,

03:31.875 --> 03:36.208
but a gopher's got to do
what a gopher's got to do.

03:38.208 --> 03:40.250
No. Wait. What I meant was--

03:40.250 --> 03:42.208
And we'll help you, Gopher.

03:42.208 --> 03:45.458
Perhaps
we should have a small
smackerel of something

03:45.458 --> 03:48.125
to celebrate before we start.

03:49.125 --> 03:50.875
Oh, bother.

03:50.875 --> 03:53.291
Is anyone hungry?

03:53.291 --> 03:54.875
Besides me, I mean.

03:54.875 --> 03:57.708
Oh, I suppose not.

03:57.708 --> 04:02.375
Well, a pooh has to do
what a pooh has to do.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.250
I can't stand this!

04:04.250 --> 04:07.500
Oops! Oh, bother.

04:07.500 --> 04:09.500
Pooh. What have you one?

04:09.500 --> 04:12.708
What a pooh had to do,
I believe.

04:12.708 --> 04:14.833
No, Pooh. Look.

04:14.833 --> 04:17.000
Oh, don't worry about that,
Rabbit.

04:18.750 --> 04:20.750
There. Oh, bother.

04:20.750 --> 04:22.875
Something
seems to be missing.

04:22.875 --> 04:24.250
Missing?

04:24.250 --> 04:26.583
Why, no, Pooh, not at all.

04:26.583 --> 04:30.250
You've one a fabulous
thing, Pooh Bear.

04:30.250 --> 04:32.833
I mean, a perfectly
fixable thing.

04:32.833 --> 04:34.625
Now run along.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.291
I promise to fix your mistake

04:37.291 --> 04:40.583
if you promise to keep
quiet about it.

04:40.583 --> 04:42.583
Quiet about what, Rabbit?

04:42.583 --> 04:44.250
Never mind, Pooh.

04:44.250 --> 04:46.875
I'll take care
of everything.

04:46.875 --> 04:49.958
Heh heh heh.
Thank you very much.

04:52.458 --> 04:57.333
Say, there's something fishy
going on around here.

04:57.333 --> 04:58.833
Have you started work

04:58.833 --> 05:01.375
on your ultimate tunnel
yet, Gopher?

05:01.375 --> 05:05.958
Nope. Seems I've made
a mistake in my calculations.

05:05.958 --> 05:09.166
Oh, well. Somehow
I'll try to go on

05:09.166 --> 05:12.125
living without it.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.291
Poor Rabbit.

05:14.291 --> 05:17.500
I hope he'll recover
from the disappointment.

05:17.500 --> 05:20.458
ta ta ta ta ta ta

05:20.458 --> 05:24.125
My, my. Even a dusty floor
looks better

05:24.125 --> 05:25.833
than one
with a big hole in it.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.333
Now what can that be?

05:30.500 --> 05:33.208
What are you doing
to Piglet's house?

05:33.208 --> 05:37.125
Just following the equation
for my ultimate tunnel.

05:37.125 --> 05:40.458
Mm, this time
I'm sure I got it right.

05:40.458 --> 05:43.458
Oh, my goodness.
What have I done?

05:43.458 --> 05:45.583
Are you all right,
Piglet?

05:45.583 --> 05:48.458
Oh, dear. Dirt
certainly piles up

05:48.458 --> 05:50.500
if you're not watching it
every minute.

05:51.875 --> 05:55.166
It's all my fault, every bit.

05:55.166 --> 05:58.000
But, uh, Rabbit,
I don't understand.

06:01.708 --> 06:03.833
Hmm. Hmm.

06:03.833 --> 06:07.375
According to Grandpappy's
calculations,

06:07.375 --> 06:10.000
the ultimate tunnel's
got to pass

06:10.000 --> 06:11.875
right under Tigger's place.

06:16.375 --> 06:17.500
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:17.500 --> 06:19.583
Nothing like a morning swim

06:19.583 --> 06:22.208
to keep my stripes
fit and trim.

06:23.208 --> 06:25.708
This is just awful.

06:25.708 --> 06:27.750
Yi! Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

06:27.750 --> 06:31.000
Help! Or I'm gonna
be the first tigger

06:31.000 --> 06:32.458
to drown in midair!

06:32.458 --> 06:34.625
Then again, maybe not.

06:35.958 --> 06:38.375
Thanks for putting
some spring in my fall,

06:38.375 --> 06:41.125
- bunny boy.
- Don't mention it, Tigger.

06:41.125 --> 06:45.250
That's funny. One minute
I was bouncing into my moat,

06:45.250 --> 06:47.083
and the next minute
I landed on you.

06:47.083 --> 06:49.750
You must have fallen

06:49.750 --> 06:51.958
through Gopher's
ultimate tunnel.

06:51.958 --> 06:54.583
Yeah. Now that you
mention it, I did.

06:54.583 --> 06:56.875
Hoo hoo.
However did you guess?

06:56.875 --> 07:00.416
Because I'm ultimately
to blame for it.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.458
Morning, Pooh Bear.

07:10.458 --> 07:12.250
Hello, Gopher.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.000
I was just trying to decide

07:14.000 --> 07:15.875
what was the most
amount of honey

07:15.875 --> 07:17.708
for the least amount
of climb.

07:17.708 --> 07:21.625
Hmm. Sure wish I had
your kind of problems.

07:21.625 --> 07:24.333
Grandpappy's equation
is getting to be

07:24.333 --> 07:25.708
more than I can handle.

07:30.000 --> 07:31.458
Oh, bother.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.000
Pooh Bear,
have you seen Gopher?

07:34.000 --> 07:37.000
Why, yes, Rabbit.
I believe I have.

07:37.000 --> 07:40.625
He disappeared down there,
along with my honey.

07:40.625 --> 07:44.750
Oh, why did I ever tamper
with Gopher's equation?

07:44.750 --> 07:47.458
It should have been my place
he tunneled through,

07:47.458 --> 07:50.250
not everyone else's.

07:50.250 --> 07:54.208
It was only a very small
smackerel of honey,

07:54.208 --> 07:57.000
but it did make Gopher's
grandpappy's equation

07:57.000 --> 07:59.625
much more, oh, less.

07:59.625 --> 08:03.291
Yeah. And old long ears
was practacally misty-eyed

08:03.291 --> 08:04.625
when the tunnel
got switched.

08:04.625 --> 08:08.000
Now the rest of him
is very misty, too.

08:08.000 --> 08:10.750
Why don't we change
Gopher's equation

08:10.750 --> 08:11.958
back to the way it was?

08:11.958 --> 08:14.708
That's a splendiferous idea.

08:14.708 --> 08:16.458
That'll cheer up
Gopher and Rabbit.

08:16.458 --> 08:19.000
And the equation, too.

08:21.583 --> 08:23.000
All: Rabbit?

08:24.375 --> 08:27.375
Oh, what are you doing here?

08:27.375 --> 08:30.000
Oh, I was just thinking.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.458
It's my fault
your homes are ruined,

08:32.458 --> 08:35.875
so I decided I had to
change the equation back

08:35.875 --> 08:37.125
to make things right.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.958
But I don't know how.

08:38.958 --> 08:42.000
Aw. Don't feel sad,
Rabbit.

08:44.000 --> 08:45.833
Neither do we.

08:45.833 --> 08:47.625
You're right, Pooh boy.

08:47.625 --> 08:48.875
So what are we waiting for?

08:51.875 --> 08:53.208
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

08:53.208 --> 08:55.000
Tiggernometry
is one of the things

08:55.000 --> 08:56.708
tiggers do best.

08:56.708 --> 08:58.583
Hoo hoo! We did it.

08:58.583 --> 08:59.708
Rabbit: Uh, not quite.

08:59.708 --> 09:02.333
Gopher's been working so hard

09:02.333 --> 09:03.500
and getting nowhere,

09:03.500 --> 09:04.708
and it's all my fault.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.458
We've fixed the equation.

09:06.458 --> 09:10.625
Now it's time to dig
Grandpappy's ultimate tunnel.

09:10.625 --> 09:13.500
And I know
just where to start.

09:19.250 --> 09:22.208
digging tunnels
takes much longer

09:22.208 --> 09:24.416
than digging
irritation streams.

09:25.583 --> 09:27.750
All night, to be exact.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.500
I don't know
if we dug it right,

09:30.500 --> 09:32.416
but we certainly dug it deep.

09:32.416 --> 09:35.583
My tummy suggests we share
a small smackerel

09:35.583 --> 09:37.375
- to celebrate.
-

09:37.375 --> 09:39.583
The tunnel sounds hungry, too.

09:39.583 --> 09:42.125
The tunnel sounds hungry?

09:46.500 --> 09:48.375
- Help!
- Oh, dear!

09:52.500 --> 09:54.875
Rabbit:
There goes the equation!

09:54.875 --> 09:57.583
Oh, no! Where's Gopher?

09:59.416 --> 10:04.500
Well, looks like Grandpappy's
dream is gone forever.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.833
It's all my fault, Gopher.

10:06.833 --> 10:09.708
I thought our homes
were more important,

10:09.708 --> 10:12.083
and just look
at the mess I've made.

10:12.083 --> 10:15.125
Of course your homes
are important.

10:15.125 --> 10:17.250
That's why I tried
to include them

10:17.250 --> 10:18.291
in the ultimate tunnel.

10:18.291 --> 10:21.000
Guess I got
carried away.

10:21.000 --> 10:22.583
Rabbit:
I think we all did.

10:22.583 --> 10:25.708
If we all got carried away,

10:25.708 --> 10:28.708
can't we all carry ourselves
back somehow?

10:28.708 --> 10:31.625
By ding-dangy,
you're right, Pooh Bear.

10:31.625 --> 10:35.750
Maybe we can't build
Grandpappy's ultimate tunnel,

10:35.750 --> 10:38.875
but, uh, we sure
can clean up after it.

10:40.458 --> 10:45.625
Now this mill is what I call
a real labor saving device.

10:45.625 --> 10:48.208
Ah, you could have
fooled me, long ears.

10:56.625 --> 10:59.000
Oh, no. Not again!

11:02.875 --> 11:05.625
Well, what do you
think of it, boys?

11:05.625 --> 11:07.750
It's wonderful, Gopher.

11:07.750 --> 11:10.708
Oh, yes. It's
the most wonderful

11:10.708 --> 11:13.458
I don't know what it is
exactly I've ever seen.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.125
This baby's my dream.

11:16.125 --> 11:21.000
I chose your home to be
the site of my super tunnel

11:21.000 --> 11:23.458
just so's I could
make it up to you

11:23.458 --> 11:25.958
for all the trouble
the last one caused.

11:25.958 --> 11:28.208
That's very thoughtful
of you, Gopher.

11:28.208 --> 11:29.625
Thank you.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.708
Bunny boy,
you're one lucky guy.

11:32.708 --> 11:33.833
Hoo hoo!

11:42.875 --> 11:45.166
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

11:45.166 --> 11:48.416
Spring is perfect for
springing into swimming holes,

11:48.416 --> 11:51.250
which everybody also knows
is what tiggers do the best.

11:53.875 --> 11:56.958
I'd rather take a nap
in this warm sun

11:56.958 --> 11:59.708
than a dip in that
very cold water.

11:59.708 --> 12:01.875
Well, then keep
your eyes peeled

12:01.875 --> 12:04.000
for my specticular
prawn dive

12:04.000 --> 12:06.250
with a half twist
of lemonade.

12:06.250 --> 12:08.625
Hoo hoo hoo-- Whew!

12:08.625 --> 12:11.125
That was a nice
ref-fresherizing dip.

12:11.125 --> 12:13.875
Hoo hoo. Your turn,
Pooh Bear.

12:13.875 --> 12:15.583
- Pooh Bear?
-

12:17.416 --> 12:20.375
Say, what good
is a nice spring nap

12:20.375 --> 12:22.083
if you're going to sleep
right through it?

12:22.083 --> 12:25.250
Why, there's got to be
gazillions of things

12:25.250 --> 12:27.708
tiggers do best
on spring days.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.958
Just like I was saying,

12:31.958 --> 12:35.625
spring's perfect for chasing
a stripety-typed butterfly.

12:37.958 --> 12:41.000
Whoo. What a dizzifying
experience.

12:41.000 --> 12:44.125
He may be stripish,
but he's not very tiggerish.

12:45.375 --> 12:47.750
Say, who'd be
creepy crawling around

12:47.750 --> 12:49.166
in the bushes

12:49.166 --> 12:50.875
on a springy type
day like this?

12:50.875 --> 12:53.708
Could it be some
monstrous monstrosity

12:53.708 --> 12:55.583
waiting to spring out
and grab you?

12:55.583 --> 12:57.083
Raah! Whoo! Aah!

12:58.166 --> 12:59.958
Maybe heffalumps.

12:59.958 --> 13:02.708
Or possibibbly woozles?

13:02.708 --> 13:05.708
Or-- gasp-- jaguluars.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.291
Yipes!

13:09.291 --> 13:10.875
Pigalet, little buddy,
little pal,

13:10.875 --> 13:14.000
what's he idea of roaming
around the woods all alone?

13:14.000 --> 13:15.708
Well, I decided

13:15.708 --> 13:17.500
to take advantage
of this beautiful day

13:17.500 --> 13:19.375
to add to my
very small collection

13:19.375 --> 13:20.833
of very small rocks.

13:20.833 --> 13:23.875
Don't you know
it's todays like today

13:23.875 --> 13:26.708
when jagulars are out
making collections

13:26.708 --> 13:29.291
of very small animals?

13:29.291 --> 13:30.708
Oh, dear.

13:30.708 --> 13:33.958
Spring is the jagular's
favorite time of year

13:33.958 --> 13:35.875
for springing out
unexpectedly

13:35.875 --> 13:38.375
at collectibibbles.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.333
Oh, uh, I just realized

13:40.333 --> 13:42.000
how much spring cleaning
I have to do.

13:42.000 --> 13:43.833
If anyone needs me,

13:43.833 --> 13:46.000
I'll be spending spring
locked in my house

13:46.000 --> 13:47.458
until fall.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.458
Hmm. I'd better
warn fluff boy.

13:51.458 --> 13:55.458
Mm. I don't know
anything-- ohh--

13:55.458 --> 13:58.583
that makes me hungrier
than a nap in the sun.

13:58.583 --> 14:02.750
Tigger doesn't seem to be
here to join me for lunch.

14:02.750 --> 14:05.833
Maybe he's here
for lunch at Piglet's.

14:07.458 --> 14:09.083
Wake up, buddy bear.

14:09.083 --> 14:10.875
I'm too late.

14:10.875 --> 14:12.625
Pooh boy's been snatched

14:12.625 --> 14:14.250
by the springing jagular.

14:14.250 --> 14:16.208
I've got to save Pooh.

14:16.208 --> 14:18.458
And I've got to protect
all my friends

14:18.458 --> 14:22.625
from the dreadiful danger
that lurks and springs.

14:28.333 --> 14:29.708
Oh, dear.

14:29.708 --> 14:31.875
Excuse me, Piglet.

14:31.875 --> 14:33.083
Yipes!

14:33.083 --> 14:35.208
This seems to be
an unusual way

14:35.208 --> 14:36.458
to arrange furniture.

14:37.583 --> 14:39.166
It makes it very difficult

14:39.166 --> 14:40.458
to use the front door.

14:40.458 --> 14:43.333
I had to climb
in the bedroom window.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.875
Oh, Pooh, what
are you doing here?

14:45.875 --> 14:48.500
Why, I'm looking
for Tigger and lunch.

14:48.500 --> 14:52.125
But not necessarily
in that order.

14:52.125 --> 14:55.083
Tigger is missing?
Oh, dear.

14:55.083 --> 14:57.416
Pooh, we have
to rescue Tigger.

14:57.416 --> 15:00.416
Rescue Tigger from what,
Piglet?

15:00.416 --> 15:02.458
The springing jagular.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.708
Tigger says they like
to collect animals...

15:04.708 --> 15:06.083
like us.

15:06.083 --> 15:07.583
Well, then,

15:07.583 --> 15:10.500
we must by all means
uncollect Tigger.

15:10.500 --> 15:11.958
Oh, but, Pooh,

15:11.958 --> 15:13.875
what if the jagular
springs into my house

15:13.875 --> 15:15.458
while we're rescuing Tigger?

15:15.458 --> 15:17.750
We shall just have
to have a surprise

15:17.750 --> 15:20.416
to spring back at the jagular.

15:20.416 --> 15:24.166
Neither rain nor snow
nor feet nor tail

15:24.166 --> 15:26.875
can stop this tigger
from warning his buddies.

15:26.875 --> 15:30.000
Unless the feets and tail
happen to be attached

15:30.000 --> 15:32.708
to a sneaky old jagular. Aah!

15:38.000 --> 15:41.083
Say, these aren't
jagular noises.

15:41.083 --> 15:42.833
They're just your
everyday kind.

15:42.833 --> 15:44.125
Hoo hoo hoo.

15:44.125 --> 15:45.583
But that's just the way

15:45.583 --> 15:47.583
would want them to sound

15:47.583 --> 15:49.333
when it's creepy
crawling upon you.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.125
What's a tigger supposed to do

15:52.125 --> 15:54.000
in a stitcheration like this?

15:54.000 --> 15:57.000
Hmm. Rabbit always
seems to know something

15:57.000 --> 15:58.625
about most things,

15:58.625 --> 16:00.458
so maybe he'd know
something about this thing.

16:00.458 --> 16:02.625
- And he's also a long way

16:02.625 --> 16:04.625
away from these
sneaky-pants-type noises.

16:04.625 --> 16:05.708
Hoo hoo hoo hoo!

16:09.583 --> 16:12.125
Not to alarm you, Piglet,

16:12.125 --> 16:16.208
but does that sound like
a springing jagular to you?

16:16.208 --> 16:17.875
- Oh, dear.

16:17.875 --> 16:19.333
Hide, Pooh.

16:21.625 --> 16:25.708
Uh-oh. Not those
noisy-type noises again.

16:27.375 --> 16:29.333
Bounce, don't fail me now.

16:29.333 --> 16:34.000
Piglet, we have
to be very, very quiet.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.625
But, Pooh, how are we
going to rescue Tigger

16:36.625 --> 16:37.708
from the jagular

16:37.708 --> 16:39.375
if we keep hiding from it?

16:39.375 --> 16:41.208
Don't worry, Piglet.

16:41.208 --> 16:44.208
I'm sure the jagular
will find us eventually.

16:44.208 --> 16:45.458
It will?

16:45.458 --> 16:47.208
Oh, yes.

16:47.208 --> 16:49.958
Jagulars usually do,
you know.

16:49.958 --> 16:52.875
Oh, dear. What will we
do then, Pooh?

16:52.875 --> 16:56.583
Well, I suppose we shall
think of something, Piglet.

16:56.583 --> 16:58.166
Won't it be
springing on us

16:58.166 --> 16:59.833
while we're thinking
of something?

16:59.833 --> 17:02.375
Not if we spring first.

17:02.375 --> 17:05.000
- Can we do that?
- Why, certainly.

17:05.000 --> 17:08.000
All we have to do is practice.

17:08.000 --> 17:11.708
Ready? 1, 2, 3,

17:11.708 --> 17:16.000
spring!

17:18.416 --> 17:20.416
That seemed much more
like falling

17:20.416 --> 17:21.500
than springing, Pooh.

17:21.500 --> 17:23.416
What the ding-dangity

17:23.416 --> 17:24.708
do you think you're doing

17:24.708 --> 17:27.125
dropping in all unexpected
like that?

17:27.125 --> 17:30.708
Don't you know you could
hurt the floor or something?

17:30.708 --> 17:32.458
I'm sorry, Gopher.

17:32.458 --> 17:34.000
I was practicing
my springing,

17:34.000 --> 17:38.250
but I don't seem to have
the up-down yet quite.

17:38.250 --> 17:41.875
Hmm. What are you
springing for anyways?

17:41.875 --> 17:44.125
To save Tigger
from the terrible jagular

17:44.125 --> 17:45.583
that's collected him.

17:45.583 --> 17:47.583
Springing jagular, huh?

17:47.583 --> 17:49.000
Well,

17:49.000 --> 17:51.708
a jagular is
everybody's problem,

17:51.708 --> 17:54.125
and I know precisely

17:54.125 --> 17:57.708
how to handle that
springy whippersnapper.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.750
No time for seed stuffing
now, long ears.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.375
Tigger, what--

18:06.375 --> 18:07.875
We got a jumping jagular

18:07.875 --> 18:09.416
that snatched a certain
Pooh Bear,

18:09.416 --> 18:11.375
otherwise
known as Pooh Bear.

18:11.375 --> 18:14.875
Jagulars?
Oh, my goodness gracious.

18:14.875 --> 18:17.958
But, bunny boy, why are we
going to Pigalet's?

18:17.958 --> 18:21.500
Before I start running around
like a fool with stripes

18:21.500 --> 18:24.125
yelling "Help! Jagular!"

18:24.125 --> 18:26.583
I want to hear Piglet's
side of the story.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.708
Aah!

18:29.708 --> 18:31.583
Tigger:
Hey, that looks like fun.

18:31.583 --> 18:32.958
Let me give it a try.

18:32.958 --> 18:35.458
Come on, long ears.
It's my turn.

18:35.458 --> 18:37.625
Just wait a minute, Tigger.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.958
There must be
a jagular out there.

18:42.958 --> 18:46.291
Why else would Piglet
build a jagular trap?

18:46.291 --> 18:49.250
We'll have
to return to the scene
of the pooh snatching,

18:49.250 --> 18:53.000
set some bait, and catch
that jagular in the act.

18:54.708 --> 18:57.083
Well, you got
the right idea, Pooh.

18:57.083 --> 19:00.833
All you need's a little
technical assistance.

19:00.833 --> 19:04.625
I wouldn't mind a little
smackerel assistance.

19:04.625 --> 19:09.166
First tonight we return
to the scene of the crime:

19:09.166 --> 19:11.625
the old swimming hole.

19:11.625 --> 19:14.333
Tonight? When it's dark?

19:14.333 --> 19:18.000
We'll set up Piglet
as bait to be collected.

19:18.000 --> 19:19.458
Oh, dear.

19:19.458 --> 19:23.375
And then Pooh and I will
grab that up-to-no-gooder.

19:25.291 --> 19:27.208
Why, thank you, Piglet.

19:27.208 --> 19:29.208
Can't we do it
when it's not so dark

19:29.208 --> 19:31.375
and when I'm somewhere
else I have to be?

19:31.375 --> 19:34.708
Nope. Dark's
the best time, Piglet.

19:34.708 --> 19:37.208
Jagulars can't see us.

19:37.208 --> 19:39.291
But we won't be able
to see it, either.

19:39.291 --> 19:41.000
Eh, trivialities.

19:41.000 --> 19:44.208
We got more important
things to think about.

19:46.500 --> 19:49.708
What's more confusing
than one pooh bear?

19:49.708 --> 19:53.000
Hmm. More confusing
than Pooh, huh?

19:53.000 --> 19:55.416
Three of them.
Ha ha ha ha!

19:55.416 --> 19:58.458
Why, that's so easy,
I didn't even know it.

19:58.458 --> 20:00.000
We'll dress like Pooh,

20:00.000 --> 20:03.083
which will confuse
the jagular so much,

20:03.083 --> 20:05.208
he won't know
who he's collected

20:05.208 --> 20:06.708
and who he hasn't.

20:06.708 --> 20:09.166
And that's when
we'll catch him.

20:09.166 --> 20:12.083
We have to
Pooh Bear-ize ourselves.

20:12.083 --> 20:13.125
Follow me.

20:14.208 --> 20:16.708
You're all set, Piglet.

20:16.708 --> 20:19.875
Pooh! Take your position.

20:19.875 --> 20:21.583
Oh, bother.

20:23.166 --> 20:26.166
Now, Tigger, you hop
on the tree swing

20:26.166 --> 20:27.708
and wait
for the jagular.

20:27.708 --> 20:30.000
Then, when it
comes for you,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.583
I'll jump out
and say "Aha."

20:32.583 --> 20:35.583
He'll be so confused,
we'll catch him

20:35.583 --> 20:37.708
and make him return
the real Pooh Bear.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.375
Anything for the good
of Pooh Beardom.

20:40.375 --> 20:43.583
The jagular's
out-disguised us.

20:43.583 --> 20:44.875
He looks like Pigalet.

20:44.875 --> 20:46.958
- Pooh?
- Yes.

20:46.958 --> 20:49.583
That "Yes" sounds
like fluff boy.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.416
I'll save you, buddy bear.

20:53.750 --> 20:55.875
Spring him, Pooh, now!

20:55.875 --> 20:58.375
Oh, bother!

20:58.375 --> 21:00.333
That sounds like the jagular.

21:00.333 --> 21:02.750
And he's not
getting away this time.

21:05.458 --> 21:07.458
- Tigger?
- Me?

21:07.458 --> 21:10.458
- Whoa!
- Oh, dear.

21:11.708 --> 21:13.250
Hoo hoo hoo!

21:13.250 --> 21:15.083
That jagular will never
show his face

21:15.083 --> 21:16.166
around here again.

21:16.166 --> 21:17.583
Tigger.

21:17.583 --> 21:18.625
Pooh boy.

21:18.625 --> 21:21.125
Both: You're saved.

21:21.125 --> 21:23.750
Aw, Pooh, you don't
have to thank me.

21:23.750 --> 21:25.125
What are friends for?

21:25.125 --> 21:28.458
Just a ding-dang minute
here, Tigger.

21:28.458 --> 21:30.458
Pooh rescued you.

21:30.458 --> 21:32.000
No, not at all.

21:32.000 --> 21:34.125
It was Tigger
who rescued Pooh.

21:34.125 --> 21:35.875
Oh, dear.

21:35.875 --> 21:39.375
A lot more of us needed
rescuing than I thought.

21:39.375 --> 21:41.625
And the best thing is, Piglet,

21:41.625 --> 21:44.500
that we all got rescued--
-- by each other.

21:44.500 --> 21:48.208
Yeah. Hoo hoo! Those old
jagulars haven't got a chance

21:48.208 --> 21:49.708
with us around.

21:49.708 --> 21:52.875
But perhaps we could all
share a small smackerel

21:52.875 --> 21:55.458
of something to celebrate
my-- uh, your--

21:55.458 --> 21:57.958
uh, our rescue.

21:57.958 --> 22:02.000
Well, that even
sounds good to me.

22:02.000 --> 22:03.458
Let's go.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.166
Oh, bother.
