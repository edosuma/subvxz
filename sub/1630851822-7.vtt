- Whoa.

00:06.631 --> 00:08.758
<i>Hey, guys. It's Selena.</i>
Okay.

00:08.842 --> 00:12.387
<i>I've learned so much about</i>

00:12.470 --> 00:15.140
One.

<i>cooking together apart.</i>

00:26.526 --> 00:27.402
[doorbell rings]

00:27.485 --> 00:28.903
Hey, guys, do you mind

00:28.987 --> 00:30.405
grabbing the groceries?

00:30.488 --> 00:32.741
- Anything for you, Head Chef.

00:32.824 --> 00:36.494
- Oh, no. Please cut that out.
[laughter]

00:36.578 --> 00:38.538
Oh, Freddy's going.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.582
- I'm nervous.
[laughter]

00:40.665 --> 00:42.542
Hey.
- Hey. So many blondes.

00:42.625 --> 00:45.003
- Yep.
[laughter]

00:45.086 --> 00:46.212
- Anything I can help with?

00:46.296 --> 00:47.839
- No, I think we got it.
- I wish.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.299
- Okay. All right.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.676
- All right. Thank you.
- Y'all take care.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.179
- He seemed like a sweet soul.
- Tell him to come in.

00:54.262 --> 00:55.722
- Didn't he?
- This is intense.

00:55.805 --> 00:57.140
- Let's see what we're doing.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.600
Look, there are shot glasses.

00:58.683 --> 01:01.352
- Oh, my God, I think
it's Korean barbeque.

01:01.436 --> 01:02.812
- Where you do it yourself.
- How fun.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.689
- DIY.
- How amazing.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.484
- Ugh, I'm so excited.

01:07.567 --> 01:10.028
Selena and Esther, take one.

01:10.111 --> 01:13.406
Let's dial up Esther.

- Hi.
- Hi, Esther.

01:48.274 --> 01:49.526
<i>- How are you?</i>

01:49.609 --> 01:50.860
<i>Are you guys excited</i>

01:50.944 --> 01:52.362
- Yeah.
- Yes, very excited.

01:52.445 --> 01:55.323
This is Theresa,
Raquelle, and Anna.

01:55.406 --> 01:57.492
But we're all blonde,
so you'll get confused.

01:57.575 --> 01:58.701
[laughter]

01:58.785 --> 02:00.328
- Definitely,
but I'm blonde too,

02:00.411 --> 02:01.913
so I can, you know,
get in with it.

02:01.996 --> 02:03.039
- Love it.

02:03.122 --> 02:04.457
- I also wanted
to introduce you

02:04.541 --> 02:06.543
to my two girls over here.

02:06.626 --> 02:07.877
- Oh, yeah.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.463
- Ilji,
she's, like, my chef helper.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.298
all: Hi.
- And this is Ashley.

02:12.382 --> 02:14.759
Just wanted you guys to say hi.
all: Hi.

02:14.843 --> 02:16.427
- They're gonna go
and maybe help

02:16.511 --> 02:17.887
once in a while,
but it's just me.

02:17.971 --> 02:20.306
- I'm sure we'll see you again.
- Yeah.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.308
- We're going straight into it.
Are you ready?

02:22.392 --> 02:25.854
- Oh, I'm born ready.
- Born ready. I love that.

02:25.937 --> 02:29.732
Today we're making a beautiful
Korean barbeque spread.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.193
<i>We're doing kimchi</i>
<i>animal sauce,</i>

02:32.277 --> 02:34.946
<i>apple ssamjang,</i>
<i>cucumber kimchi,</i>

02:35.029 --> 02:36.573
<i>marinated short ribs,</i>

02:36.656 --> 02:39.951
<i>we're doing spicy pork,</i>
<i>and a beautiful bouquet</i>

02:40.034 --> 02:42.245
<i>of lettuces</i>
<i>and mixed mushrooms.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:46.457
<i>And to top it all off,</i>
<i>corn cheese and egg soufflé.</i>

02:46.541 --> 02:48.251
- I love Korean barbeque.
<i>- [laughs]</i>

02:48.334 --> 02:49.794
- We're ready.
- We love it.

02:49.878 --> 02:51.254
- We're excited.
- Yeah.

02:51.337 --> 02:53.590
- We're gonna start
with making the marinade.

02:53.673 --> 02:57.343
So let's start
with bringing in the onion.

02:57.427 --> 02:58.970
- Let's do it.

02:59.053 --> 03:01.389
- Soy sauce.
- Soy sauce.

03:01.472 --> 03:03.141
- Asian pear,
which looks like this.

03:03.224 --> 03:05.226
- Ooh, Asian pear.
- Ooh.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.061
<i>- Garlic.</i>
- Got it.

03:07.145 --> 03:10.273
- Sesame oil, sugar...
- Sugar.

03:10.356 --> 03:11.774
- Our sake.

03:11.858 --> 03:13.151
- Maybe it's in that green...

03:13.234 --> 03:14.736
- Oh, yeah, the sake.

03:14.819 --> 03:17.155
- Who's the King Charles?
Who's that?

03:17.238 --> 03:18.781
- Fred.
- My baby Fred.

03:18.865 --> 03:20.325
- Anna's child.

03:20.408 --> 03:22.535
- Hi, Fred.
[laughter]

03:22.619 --> 03:25.622
Okay, fish sauce,
and then gochujang.

03:25.705 --> 03:27.665
- Fish sauce,
and what was that last one?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.751
- The gochujang.
So it's in the red tub.

03:29.834 --> 03:31.586
- Gochujang.
<i>- Kay, so gochujang</i>

03:31.669 --> 03:34.923
is basically
a fermented chili paste.

03:35.006 --> 03:37.050
It's a little spicy.
Have you guys had that before?

03:37.133 --> 03:38.885
all: Yes.
<i>- So excited.</i>

03:38.968 --> 03:41.137
Okay, and you're gonna
need a blender.

03:41.220 --> 03:42.388
- All righty.

03:42.472 --> 03:44.098
- So we're just gonna use
half this onion.

03:44.182 --> 03:45.934
So let's cut it and peel it.

03:46.017 --> 03:49.479
- Yes, ma'am.
- Perfect, perfect, perfect.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.147
Half of it you can set aside

03:51.230 --> 03:53.358
'cause we're gonna use it later
for caramelized onions.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.734
- Oh, yum.

03:54.817 --> 03:56.152
<i>- You got your onion.</i>
<i>Let's chunk it.</i>

03:56.235 --> 03:57.528
<i>Doesn't have to be perfect</i>

03:57.612 --> 03:58.947
'cause it's gonna go
in the blender.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.323
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.700
- And then your Asian pear.

04:02.784 --> 04:05.161
We're just gonna peel it.
- Like, with a peeler?

04:05.244 --> 04:06.829
- A peeler.
- Okay.

04:06.913 --> 04:08.539
- Well, unless you wanna try
to do it with your knife.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.583
I think it would be
very difficult for you, but--

04:10.667 --> 04:13.711
all: No.
[laughter]

04:13.795 --> 04:15.505
- So with the pear,
to make things easier,

04:15.588 --> 04:18.299
we're just gonna cut
around the core.

04:18.383 --> 04:19.676
- Mm-hmm.

04:23.137 --> 04:25.014
- Be careful.
- Be careful, Sel.

04:25.098 --> 04:26.599
- Don't hurt yourself.
- I got it.

04:26.683 --> 04:28.726
- On this episode,
we're not cutting ourselves.

04:28.810 --> 04:31.062
- Oh, she took a little bite.
- That's right.

04:31.145 --> 04:33.690
<i>- Is it good?</i>
- Yeah.

04:33.773 --> 04:34.941
[laughter]

04:35.024 --> 04:36.484
- Well, we're only using
half the pearl,

04:36.567 --> 04:38.111
so the other half,
the girls can eat.

04:38.194 --> 04:40.446
- Oh, it's delicious.
Very refreshing.

04:41.197 --> 04:44.242
- And the pear and the marinade
will break down the meat

04:44.325 --> 04:46.703
and make it, like,
super tender.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.372
Also give, like,
a nice floral sweetness,

04:49.455 --> 04:50.832
<i>so that's why</i>
<i>we're using the pear.</i>

04:50.915 --> 04:52.625
- That's great.
It tastes delicious.

04:52.709 --> 04:53.793
- Yeah.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.586
- So we're gonna use
half of this

04:55.670 --> 04:57.755
and throw it in the blender.

04:58.715 --> 05:00.216
[sighs]
You know what I forgot?

05:00.299 --> 05:02.802
I forgot that we--
I'm gonna wear an apron

05:02.885 --> 05:05.763
because Korean food can
kind of get a little messy.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.015
- Okay.

05:07.098 --> 05:08.307
- And you're wearing
a white shirt.

05:08.391 --> 05:09.934
So I'm a little concerned.

05:10.018 --> 05:13.896
- I have to say, she does spill
on every single outfit

05:13.980 --> 05:17.316
in every episode
and never wears an apron.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.819
So I feel like
today could be the day.

05:19.902 --> 05:21.404
- Today's the day.
- Oh, we all have to wear one.

05:21.487 --> 05:23.031
- Everyone has to wear one.

05:23.114 --> 05:24.741
both: Okay.
- I want to wear one.

05:24.824 --> 05:25.783
I want that one.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.201
- This is so chic.
- No!

05:27.285 --> 05:30.496
- Okay, garlic.
Let's do five cloves.

05:30.580 --> 05:32.373
And you can throw it
in the blender.

05:32.457 --> 05:34.500
- Whoops.
- Garlic down.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.085
- A cup of soy sauce.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.254
- That smells so good.

05:38.337 --> 05:40.923
- Half a cup of sesame oil.

05:41.007 --> 05:43.259
[all gasp]

05:43.342 --> 05:44.927
Half a cup of sugar.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.013
- Just make sure that's sugar.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.639
Is that salt or sugar?

05:48.723 --> 05:50.183
- It's sugar.

05:50.266 --> 05:54.312
- Quarter cup of sake.
- Ooh.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.939
- Fish sauce,
a quarter cup of that.

05:57.023 --> 05:58.274
- Oh, man.

05:58.357 --> 06:00.610
- How long have you been
cooking for, Esther?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.945
- I actually learned to cook
from my grandma.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.283
<i>And I learned professionally</i>
<i>as well after college.</i>

06:07.366 --> 06:09.285
Like, 15 years now almost.

06:09.368 --> 06:10.620
- Nice.

06:10.703 --> 06:12.455
- But I grew up cooking
with my grandma.

06:12.538 --> 06:14.791
<i>So pretty much</i>
<i>a lot longer than that.</i>

06:14.874 --> 06:16.167
both: Wow.

06:16.250 --> 06:18.044
- So let's blend this.

06:18.127 --> 06:21.380
- Ah.
[laughter]

06:21.464 --> 06:23.007
all: "Ah."

06:24.425 --> 06:27.303
- Okay let's grab
two large bowls.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.222
[dishes clattering]
- Whoa, whoa.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.390
- Okay. This is stressful.

06:31.474 --> 06:32.809
[clattering]
- Sel!

06:32.892 --> 06:35.978
- Are you okay?
- You're gonna, like--

06:36.062 --> 06:37.480
- It's like a ruckus
over there.

06:37.563 --> 06:39.565
- Welcome to Selena's kitchen.

06:39.649 --> 06:41.067
- All right.
<i>- All right.</i>

06:41.150 --> 06:43.194
Split the marinade
in two bowls.

06:43.986 --> 06:45.488
- Smell that.
- Oh, this is...

06:45.571 --> 06:47.698
- Oh, yes.
- This is your kinda meal.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.158
- Ooh, yes.
[laughter]

06:49.242 --> 06:50.493
- You're so happy.
- So excited.

06:50.576 --> 06:52.036
- We gon' eat good.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.704
- We're not even doing what
I'm supposed to be doing.

06:53.788 --> 06:55.039
- Do you wanna taste it?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.165
Do you wanna give it
a little taste?

06:56.249 --> 06:57.458
- Yes, I do.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.460
- To make sure
it's to your liking?

06:59.544 --> 07:01.462
- Oh!
- Yeah, you like it?

07:01.546 --> 07:03.005
- I love it.
- You love it?

07:03.089 --> 07:04.674
- I wanna eat this as soup.

07:04.757 --> 07:07.218
- Oh, wow,
that's really intense.

07:07.301 --> 07:08.886
All right,
so what we're gonna do

07:08.970 --> 07:11.389
is take your gochujang,
the chili paste.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.516
- Yes.
<i>- This is what will</i>

07:13.599 --> 07:14.976
differentiate
the two marinades.

07:15.059 --> 07:17.019
So we're marinating
two types of meat.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.856
We're marinating pork
and we're marinating beef.

07:19.939 --> 07:20.982
- Yum.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.567
- So just take,
like, a spoonful

07:22.650 --> 07:23.985
and just add it to one of them.

07:24.068 --> 07:26.529
- Oh, yeah, I love this stuff.
- Whoa.

07:26.612 --> 07:28.156
- That looks good. Perfect.

07:28.239 --> 07:30.867
Let's whisk the gochujang
into the marinade.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.369
- Why do we have
such a big-ass whisk?

07:33.452 --> 07:35.037
Look at this.
[laughter]

07:35.121 --> 07:37.540
- Oh, wait.
- It's so...

07:37.623 --> 07:40.293
- Oh, wow.
Do you have a smaller--

07:40.376 --> 07:41.836
- Sel, you have,
like, so many--

07:41.919 --> 07:45.047
- Guys, we can't hear her.
Sorry, go ahead.

07:45.131 --> 07:47.466
- Do you have a smaller whisk?
If not, you're fine.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.010
- It's always extreme.
There's no--

07:49.093 --> 07:50.845
- I just was laughing
'cause I saw Esther's,

07:50.928 --> 07:52.388
and it's, like,
this tiny baby whisk

07:52.471 --> 07:54.265
and we had this giant--

07:54.348 --> 07:57.602
- Goes 0 to 100 real quick.
- All righty.

07:57.685 --> 08:00.479
- So the other whisk you were
using is a balloon whisk,

08:00.563 --> 08:02.440
<i>and that's normally</i>
<i>for, like, meringue.</i>

08:02.523 --> 08:04.567
Like, dessert.
But it's all good.

08:04.650 --> 08:05.902
It's still a whisk.

08:05.985 --> 08:07.486
- Oh, that was so...

08:07.570 --> 08:10.406
- Okay, so one will be,
like, slightly spicy.

08:10.489 --> 08:12.783
And then one will be more
of, like, a savory sweet.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.577
So that's how you make
two different marinades

08:14.660 --> 08:15.661
but, like, one base.

08:15.745 --> 08:17.246
Super easy.
- Awesome.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.789
<i>- Okay, so let's go</i>
<i>to the fridge</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:20.124
<i>and grab your meat.</i>

08:20.208 --> 08:22.460
- Oh, it's party time.

08:22.543 --> 08:24.545
- You know what would be funny?
- What?

08:24.629 --> 08:27.590
- Is if I taught y'all
how to cook.

08:27.673 --> 08:29.383
<i>- Hey, girls.</i>
- That would be hilarious.

08:29.467 --> 08:31.427
- Do you guys wanna maybe drink

08:31.510 --> 08:33.012
<i>a shot of soju with me?</i>

08:33.095 --> 08:34.889
all: Yes!

08:34.972 --> 08:36.349
- Yeah? Let's do it. Okay.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.517
- Do we have the shot--
<i>- Awesome.</i>

08:38.601 --> 08:40.102
- They're over there?
You see the clear ones?

08:40.186 --> 08:41.854
Right there, right there,
right there, right there.

08:41.938 --> 08:43.439
- I'm gonna bring
my girls in too.

08:43.522 --> 08:46.609
- Yay!
- So we can do a shot together.

08:46.692 --> 08:49.070
- Water shot for Sel.
- To the girls.

08:49.153 --> 08:50.947
- To the girls and cooking.

08:51.030 --> 08:52.198
[all cheering]

08:52.281 --> 08:53.574
<i>- Cheers!</i>

08:56.202 --> 08:58.579
- Yes.
[all coughing]

08:58.663 --> 09:00.456
- [laughs]
<i>- Whoo-hoo!</i>

09:00.539 --> 09:02.458
<i>- I know.</i>
<i>It's a little intense.</i>

09:02.541 --> 09:06.003
Selena, do you have
a karaoke machine?

09:06.087 --> 09:08.130
- I do.
- Yes!

09:08.214 --> 09:09.632
You know Korean barbeque
is all about,

09:09.715 --> 09:11.676
<i>like, karaoke</i>
<i>for dessert, right?</i>

09:11.759 --> 09:15.137
- Yes, actually.
I've done that before.

09:15.221 --> 09:18.015
- We're gonna, like, get wasted
and then do karaoke.

09:18.099 --> 09:19.517
- Oh, fun!
- Great.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.435
That sounds like every Friday.
[laughter]

09:21.519 --> 09:24.522
<i>- That's all part</i>
<i>of the experience.</i>

09:24.605 --> 09:25.940
- So your meat.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.692
Let's start with the beef.
<i>- Got it.</i>

09:27.775 --> 09:30.027
- We're gonna cut this
into, like, three

09:30.111 --> 09:32.822
so that's it's
kind of bite-size.

09:32.905 --> 09:36.826
And you can just throw it
into your not-spicy marinade.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.286
- Kay.

09:38.369 --> 09:39.912
- So the cut we're using,
it's short rib.

09:39.996 --> 09:41.539
You know, when you go
to the Korean supermarket,

09:41.622 --> 09:44.000
it's really great
because they already have it

09:44.083 --> 09:45.584
butchered like this for you.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.378
<i>You don't have</i>
<i>to cut it so small.</i>

09:47.461 --> 09:50.756
I mean, some people like
big pieces of meat.

09:50.840 --> 09:53.050
Some people like--
- I love big pieces of meat.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.177
- Theresa loves
big pieces of meat.

09:55.261 --> 09:58.347
- She's like "'Selena + Chef'
is provocative."

09:58.431 --> 09:59.765
[laughter]

09:59.849 --> 10:01.851
- Selena, did you grow up

10:01.934 --> 10:03.686
cooking at all
with your family?

10:03.769 --> 10:05.855
- So my dad's side,

10:05.938 --> 10:08.858
my grandmother's
the cook of the house.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.527
So what she did was
cook all day long.

10:11.610 --> 10:13.279
And it would just be

10:13.362 --> 10:15.698
constant fragrance
in the house.

10:15.781 --> 10:18.117
So when I was younger,
I would mess around.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.870
Then my mom's side, you know,
would go fishing,

10:20.953 --> 10:23.372
and I used to--
what is it, descale?

10:23.456 --> 10:25.833
- Oh, yeah.
- Descale the fish.

10:25.916 --> 10:27.710
- Yeah, like, scale the fish?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

10:27.793 --> 10:29.962
But obviously,
I'm not like you, of course,

10:30.046 --> 10:31.922
getting into it professionally.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.633
- Now you are.
You're becoming a professional.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.218
- This is season three.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.721
<i>- ♪ Mm, mm, mm,</i>
<i>mm, mm, mm, mm, mm ♪</i>

10:38.804 --> 10:41.307
<i>♪ Look at her now ♪</i>
- You're a chef.

10:41.390 --> 10:42.683
<i>- Okay, so let's do the pork.</i>

10:42.767 --> 10:44.226
Same thing: like, three chunks,

10:44.310 --> 10:46.062
and then throw it
into the spicy.

10:46.145 --> 10:47.730
- Much better.

10:47.813 --> 10:50.149
- Let's do
a little mixy-mixing.

10:50.232 --> 10:52.276
- Theresa's lit.
She's mixing with a knife.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.487
- I'm not putting my hands...
- I love this scene.

10:54.570 --> 10:55.821
It's like a meat party.

10:55.905 --> 10:58.282
- Have you ever been to Korea?

10:58.366 --> 11:01.744
- Oh, my gosh, so I used to go
really often,

11:01.827 --> 11:04.455
but obviously, because of COVID
and everything,

11:04.538 --> 11:06.707
it's been a year and a half
since I've been.

11:06.791 --> 11:09.835
Yeah, but I like to go because
I have a lot of friends there.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.504
That's where I get
a lot of my inspiration.

11:11.587 --> 11:13.756
And it's like motherland
for me, you know?

11:13.839 --> 11:15.216
- That's awesome.

11:15.299 --> 11:16.675
- Have you guys been
to Korea, anyone?

11:16.759 --> 11:18.469
- No.
- No. I would love to, though.

11:18.552 --> 11:21.180
- Selena, that's
your next spot, okay?

11:21.263 --> 11:22.640
- I'm down.

11:22.723 --> 11:26.477
- So we are going to pop this
in the fridge

11:26.560 --> 11:29.980
and let it marinade while
we work on everything else.

11:30.064 --> 11:32.525
- After you, my lady.

11:32.608 --> 11:35.111
- So the next thing is,
we're gonna caramelize

11:35.194 --> 11:38.280
half this onion,
so let's do a dice on this.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.949
- Okay.
<i>- Do you know the trick</i>

11:40.032 --> 11:42.284
where you cut into it
like that?

11:42.368 --> 11:43.369
- Yeah.

11:43.452 --> 11:45.371
- This is always
so nerve-racking.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.957
- Be careful.
Good, good, good.

11:48.040 --> 11:50.835
And then you just do one
in the middle.

11:50.918 --> 11:52.128
<i>And you know what?</i>
<i>Don't even do that</i>

11:52.211 --> 11:53.838
because you might
hurt yourself.

11:53.921 --> 11:56.465
So let's just cut straight in.
Good.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.134
I mean, there's a little bit
of peel in that,

11:58.217 --> 12:00.261
but okay, that's fine.

12:00.344 --> 12:02.847
- Esther, what's your favorite
karaoke song?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.598
- I love K-Pop.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.475
<i>I know, Selena, you did, like,</i>
<i>a Blackpink thing, right?</i>

12:06.559 --> 12:09.437
<i>- I sure did.</i>
<i>It was so much fun.</i>

12:09.520 --> 12:11.522
<i>- So cute.</i>
<i>- Aww.</i>

12:11.605 --> 12:12.773
<i>- I grew up on K-Pop,</i>

12:12.857 --> 12:15.151
So I, like, love
to sing in Korean.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.820
I have to, right?
I gotta support my peeps.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.155
- Yeah, exactly.

12:19.238 --> 12:21.657
- All right, so you're just
gonna get a pan.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.159
- Kay.
- I'll get a pan.

12:23.242 --> 12:26.120
- Add the onions to that
with a little bit of oil.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.706
- Here we go.
<i>- You're doing great, ladies.</i>

12:28.789 --> 12:31.333
Turn on the heat to medium.
- Got it.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.170
<i>- This process will take</i>
<i>about, like, 10, 15 minutes.</i>

12:34.253 --> 12:35.963
So maybe, like,
one of you girls can, like,

12:36.046 --> 12:38.090
<i>hang out there and make sure</i>
<i>it's not, like, burning.</i>

12:38.174 --> 12:39.550
- Yeah.

12:39.633 --> 12:42.052
- In the meantime,
we're gonna do cucumber kimchi.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.304
- Cucumber.

12:43.387 --> 12:46.182
- Grab five
of the mini cucumbers,

12:46.265 --> 12:50.102
and we're also gonna grab
a mandolin.

12:50.186 --> 12:52.563
- The mandolin.

12:52.646 --> 12:54.190
- You wanna grab a bowl.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.233
<i>And what we're gonna do,</i>
<i>we're gonna mandolin</i>

12:56.317 --> 12:58.360
the cucumber
straight into the bowl.

12:59.278 --> 13:00.696
- Oh.
<i>- Okay.</i>

13:00.779 --> 13:03.032
Oh, wait, you're
making me nervous doing that.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.451
When you hold the cucumber,
hold it from the top

13:05.534 --> 13:07.912
so that your hand isn't
close to the bottom.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.748
Just make sure when you're
getting closer to the end,

13:10.831 --> 13:13.167
just go really slow
and be careful.

13:13.250 --> 13:14.793
- I'm taking my time.

13:14.877 --> 13:17.129
- It's one of the most
dangerous tools in the kitchen,

13:17.213 --> 13:21.217
but it just makes everything
so easy and uniform.

13:21.300 --> 13:24.094
<i>[tense music]</i>

13:24.178 --> 13:27.139
- My girlfriends are
taking selfies.

13:27.223 --> 13:30.267
- No, we're not.
- [laughs]

13:30.351 --> 13:32.228
<i>How are the onions?</i>
<i>Is it sizzling?</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:35.314
- Yes, it's sizzling, and it's
getting a little translucent.

13:35.397 --> 13:38.484
- Okay, good.
So tell me about the cute boys

13:38.567 --> 13:40.402
that have been delivering
your groceries.

13:40.486 --> 13:42.821
- Oh, dear.
- Okay, to sum it up,

13:42.905 --> 13:46.158
they've all been
pretty amazing.

13:46.242 --> 13:49.286
Hopefully, one day we can
bring them into the house

13:49.370 --> 13:51.330
so it's not just
an outside meetup.

13:51.413 --> 13:54.083
- Oh, I didn't realize
this was a dating show as well.

13:54.166 --> 13:56.919
I love that.
[laughter]

13:57.002 --> 14:00.047
All right, so we're gonna
grab some salt.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.423
- Salt.

14:01.507 --> 14:03.425
- No, it's the thing
that says "salt."

14:03.509 --> 14:05.844
- The thing that says "salt"?
- Yeah.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.972
- Like, a generous amount
of salt.

14:08.055 --> 14:10.766
Like, grab it like that.
And then you just mix it.

14:10.849 --> 14:12.726
- Oh, I thought
this was gonna be healthy.

14:12.810 --> 14:15.980
- No, no, it is healthy.
We're not consuming the salt.

14:16.063 --> 14:17.606
We're gonna wash it out later.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.358
<i>What the salt is gonna do</i>
<i>to the cucumbers,</i>

14:19.441 --> 14:21.527
it's gonna draw out
all the moisture

14:21.610 --> 14:24.029
and it's gonna give
this incredible texture

14:24.113 --> 14:25.281
to the cucumber.

14:25.364 --> 14:27.074
- Okay.
- Press it down like that.

14:27.157 --> 14:29.201
And then set it aside.
- Yep.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.703
<i>- All right,</i>
<i>so we're moving on</i>

14:30.786 --> 14:33.455
<i>to one of our sauces,</i>
<i>apple ssamjang.</i>

14:33.539 --> 14:36.959
So, Selena,
you wanna grab your apple.

14:37.042 --> 14:38.419
- Okay.
<i>- This is gonna be,</i>

14:38.502 --> 14:40.087
like, a dipping sauce.

14:40.170 --> 14:43.632
- Ooh.
- Okay, let's peel the apple.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.510
All right, while Selena
peels the apple,

14:46.594 --> 14:48.304
<i>Raquelle, do you wanna grab</i>

14:48.387 --> 14:50.723
all the lettuces
from the fridge?

14:50.806 --> 14:53.767
- Yes, would love to.
<i>- All the beautiful lettuces.</i>

14:54.852 --> 14:56.353
- Look!
- Oh, whoa, that's cool.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.022
- Oh, it's gonna look
even prettier

14:58.105 --> 14:59.732
<i>once we're, like,</i>
<i>done with it.</i>

14:59.815 --> 15:02.026
Great, all right, so same thing
with the apple.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.485
Let's cut it around the core

15:03.569 --> 15:06.614
so it makes it easier
for you, right?

15:06.697 --> 15:08.282
And then with the rest
of the apple,

15:08.365 --> 15:09.950
we're just gonna,
like, dice it.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.829
- Fred is loving today.
- He's like, "I smell meat."

15:13.912 --> 15:16.165
- You got it, girl.
- [laughs]

15:16.248 --> 15:17.666
- How we feeling, ladies?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.168
<i>Oh, your onions</i>
<i>are looking great.</i>

15:19.251 --> 15:21.670
- Good.
<i>- You can turn off the heat.</i>

15:21.754 --> 15:25.090
Before you leave the pan,
can you put that into a bowl

15:25.174 --> 15:27.343
and stick it in the fridge
so it gets cold?

15:27.426 --> 15:28.677
- Yup.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.387
<i>- Hey, Raquelle,</i>
<i>you want to maybe find,</i>

15:30.471 --> 15:32.514
like, a beautiful big platter
for the lettuce?

15:32.598 --> 15:33.849
- Yes.

15:33.932 --> 15:35.559
<i>- Like, wherever</i>
<i>you wanna put it on.</i>

15:35.643 --> 15:37.519
Like I'm gonna put it on this,
like, beautiful board.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.146
<i>- Oh, nice.</i>

15:39.229 --> 15:40.939
<i>- So find something</i>
<i>really pretty to put it on.</i>

15:41.023 --> 15:43.859
- All right.
<i>- Presentation is everything,</i>

15:43.942 --> 15:46.528
and that's what Korean barbeque
is about.

15:46.612 --> 15:48.280
<i>Selena, that looks great.</i>

15:48.364 --> 15:52.534
Let's find a bowl and put
all the apples in a bowl.

15:52.618 --> 15:53.577
Okay.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.622
<i>So for the dipping sauce,</i>

15:56.705 --> 15:59.625
<i>we're gonna grab</i>
<i>your gochujang.</i>

15:59.708 --> 16:02.544
You're also gonna
grab doenjang,

16:02.628 --> 16:04.630
<i>which should be in a tub</i>
<i>that looks like that,</i>

16:04.713 --> 16:06.590
<i>but it's brown.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

16:06.674 --> 16:10.052
<i>Also, sesame oil,</i>
<i>you have garlic...</i>

16:10.135 --> 16:12.721
- Yeah.
- Two stalks of scallion.

16:12.805 --> 16:13.972
- Got it.

16:14.056 --> 16:16.225
- And we're just gonna
chop it up.

16:16.308 --> 16:17.726
And we're gonna add it
to the apples.

16:17.810 --> 16:20.479
- Is the brown container
as spicy as the red?

16:20.562 --> 16:22.564
- It's not.
It's similar to miso.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.067
It's, like, really funky
and fermented.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.111

Okay, we're gonna grate
the garlic.

Just one clove.

16:34.993 --> 16:37.413
<i>You can just grate it</i>
<i>straight into the apple.</i>

16:37.496 --> 16:38.622
- Okay.

16:38.706 --> 16:40.666

half a cup

16:42.626 --> 16:44.586
- Oh, my gosh.
- Half a cup straight in.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.089
- Yeah, I know it seems
like a lot, but don't worry.

16:47.172 --> 16:51.593

a quarter cup of the doenjang.

- Excited?

17:00.436 --> 17:02.521
Well, I was gonna say it's
a little intense in the funk.

17:02.604 --> 17:05.274
To me, like, funk means flavor.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.192
- That's the name
of Sel's new song.

17:07.276 --> 17:10.654

a quarter cup of sesame oil.

17:10.738 --> 17:12.197

the animal sauce from In-N-Out.
