WEBVTT

00:02.002 --> 00:03.003
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, Rodney, I know

00:03.037 --> 00:04.004
the agreement is for two years.

00:04.038 --> 00:06.707
The truth is, I'm on dialysis.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.676
It's acute renal failure caused

00:08.709 --> 00:09.843
by sweat poisoning.

00:09.877 --> 00:11.011
Strenuous exercise could

00:11.045 --> 00:12.213
literally kill me.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.714
I'm with my doctor right now.

00:13.747 --> 00:14.915
Let me put him on.

00:14.948 --> 00:16.084
>> JIMMY: Oh, come on.

00:16.117 --> 00:18.018
(sighs)

00:18.052 --> 00:19.187
(Indian accent): This is

00:19.220 --> 00:20.388
Dr. Patel.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.223
Look, between you and me, she's

00:22.256 --> 00:23.691
on her deathbed.

00:23.724 --> 00:25.559
I told her to cancel her gym

00:25.593 --> 00:27.061
membership just to give her a

00:27.095 --> 00:28.729
purpose in her final hours.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.431
What a tragedy to die so young

00:30.464 --> 00:31.899
having not accomplished anything

00:31.932 --> 00:33.067
in life.

00:33.101 --> 00:34.268
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, that guy.

00:34.302 --> 00:35.503
What a pessimist.

00:35.536 --> 00:36.737
I'm gonna fight this thing!

00:36.770 --> 00:37.905
Thanks, Rodney.

00:37.938 --> 00:38.939
You've been a delight.

00:38.972 --> 00:39.940
>> JIMMY: Why don't you just

00:39.973 --> 00:40.941
say, "I don't want to go to your

00:40.974 --> 00:41.942
dumb gym anymore?"

00:41.975 --> 00:42.943
>> GRETCHEN: Because I don't

00:42.976 --> 00:44.612
want Rodney out there judging me

00:44.645 --> 00:45.613
when I don't show up for 10:00

00:45.646 --> 00:46.547
a.m. Pilates class.

00:46.580 --> 00:47.548
>> JIMMY: You've never been to a

00:47.581 --> 00:48.349
10:00 a.m. anything.

00:48.382 --> 00:49.350
>> GRETCHEN: My flight's soon.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.551
Can we continue this when I come

00:50.584 --> 00:51.752
back from parental purgatory?

00:51.785 --> 00:52.920
>> JIMMY: Are your folks really

00:52.953 --> 00:54.455
that awful?

00:54.488 --> 00:55.956
>> GRETCHEN: Just uptight and

00:55.989 --> 00:56.857
lame.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.092
They act like I don't have my

00:58.126 --> 01:00.128
shit together.

01:00.161 --> 01:01.129
>> JIMMY: Those clothes aren't

01:01.162 --> 01:02.363
even fully dry.

01:02.396 --> 01:03.431
>> GRETCHEN: I'm gonna go borrow

01:03.464 --> 01:05.599
your toothbrush.

01:08.636 --> 01:09.770
(Edgar sighs)

01:09.803 --> 01:10.971
>> JIMMY: Uh, the trash goes

01:11.004 --> 01:12.206
from inside to outside, not the

01:12.240 --> 01:13.274
other way around.

01:13.307 --> 01:14.275
>> EDGAR: Oh, I've been trying

01:14.308 --> 01:15.443
this recycling thing.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.644
If I save up enough money, I can

01:16.677 --> 01:17.878
buy Ambien from this Web site.

01:17.911 --> 01:19.113
>> JIMMY: Isn't the V.A.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.448
supposed to give you drugs for

01:20.481 --> 01:21.449
your... for your war brain

01:21.482 --> 01:22.616
stuff?

01:22.650 --> 01:23.817
>> EDGAR: I don't want to use up

01:23.851 --> 01:25.052
resources when there are vets

01:25.085 --> 01:26.287
out there with real problems.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.455
>> JIMMY: You're trading soda

01:27.488 --> 01:28.622
cans for black market

01:28.656 --> 01:29.823
pharmaceuticals.

01:29.857 --> 01:31.659
That is a problem.

01:31.692 --> 01:32.660
>> EDGAR: Fine.

01:32.693 --> 01:35.129
I'll go talk to them.

01:35.163 --> 01:36.130
>> GRETCHEN: And I'm out.

01:36.164 --> 01:37.131
>> JIMMY: All right, just let me

01:37.165 --> 01:38.132
wash this mask off, and then we

01:38.166 --> 01:39.133
can go.

01:39.167 --> 01:40.134
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, no, no, no.

01:40.168 --> 01:40.901
I'll just take an Uber.

01:40.934 --> 01:41.902
>> JIMMY: I'm headed that

01:41.935 --> 01:42.570
direction anyway.

01:42.603 --> 01:43.504
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy, you're not

01:43.537 --> 01:44.505
driving me to the airport.

01:44.538 --> 01:45.506
That's ridiculous.

01:45.539 --> 01:46.474
>> JIMMY: Look, I promise there

01:46.507 --> 01:48.476
will be no mushy, curbside

01:48.509 --> 01:49.477
stuff, okay?

01:49.510 --> 01:50.644
I won't even come to a complete

01:50.678 --> 01:51.345
stop.

01:51.379 --> 01:52.513
You can just tuck and roll, all

01:52.546 --> 01:53.181
right?

01:53.214 --> 01:55.183
Give me a couple of minutes.

02:02.022 --> 02:05.259
>> * I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:05.293 --> 02:07.328
I'm gonna leave you anyway

02:07.361 --> 02:09.663
Gonna leave you anyway. *

02:14.868 --> 02:15.836
>> BECCA: You cheated on Paul?!

02:15.869 --> 02:16.837
>> LINDSAY: Shh.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.005
Don't whisper-yell at me!

02:18.038 --> 02:19.207
>> BECCA: How can you even live

02:19.240 --> 02:20.208
with yourself?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.209
>> LINDSAY: I can't!

02:21.242 --> 02:22.643
I feel so bad, I can't eat or

02:22.676 --> 02:24.011
watch any shows with adultery.

02:24.044 --> 02:25.179
That's all my shows.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.180
I'm getting nosebleeds from the

02:26.214 --> 02:26.847
guilt.

02:26.880 --> 02:27.848
>> BECCA: Nosebleeds?

02:27.881 --> 02:28.849
>> LINDSAY: Also, I lied.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.017
I can totally eat.

02:30.050 --> 02:31.219
>> WOMAN: Ladies, please keep it

02:31.252 --> 02:32.453
down.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.621
>> LINDSAY: It's not fair.

02:33.654 --> 02:35.022
You don't know what it's like

02:35.055 --> 02:36.224
to yearn for the touch of

02:36.257 --> 02:38.992
another.

02:39.026 --> 02:39.993
>> BECCA: Jimmy tried to kiss

02:40.027 --> 02:40.994
me.

02:41.028 --> 02:42.296
>> LINDSAY (loudly): What?!

02:42.330 --> 02:43.531
>> BECCA: But I...

02:43.564 --> 02:46.367
Oh, I said no... because I love

02:46.400 --> 02:47.535
my husband.

02:47.568 --> 02:48.702
>> LINDSAY: Did you want to?

02:48.736 --> 02:49.903
>> BECCA: I took a vow.

02:49.937 --> 02:52.206
Marriage means being in it 24/7

02:52.240 --> 02:53.541
from the moment when you wake up

02:53.574 --> 02:55.142
in the morning, and you see that

02:55.175 --> 02:57.378
red, curly happy trail, to at

02:57.411 --> 02:59.313
night when he rolls off of you

02:59.347 --> 03:00.314
and asks if you've had your

03:00.348 --> 03:01.215
"gazz" yet.

03:01.249 --> 03:02.082
>> LINDSAY: He asks you after he

03:02.115 --> 03:03.016
rolls off you?

03:03.050 --> 03:03.817
>> BECCA: The point is, I

03:03.851 --> 03:04.818
restrain myself because I am not

03:04.852 --> 03:05.519
an animal.

03:05.553 --> 03:06.420
After this class, you are gonna

03:06.454 --> 03:07.421
come clean with Paul.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.422
>> LINDSAY: I can't tell him.

03:08.456 --> 03:09.423
>> BECCA: Lindsay, you're not

03:09.457 --> 03:10.424
gonna tell him?

03:10.458 --> 03:11.425
>> LINDSAY: Ow! Ow! Bec, stop!

03:11.459 --> 03:12.426
>> BECCA: You need me to make

03:12.460 --> 03:13.093
you tell him?

03:13.126 --> 03:14.061
>> BECCA: You gonna tell him,

03:14.094 --> 03:15.062
Lindsay? You gonna tell him?

03:15.095 --> 03:15.729
>> LINDSAY: Ow!

03:15.763 --> 03:16.730
>> BECCA: You know I can make

03:16.764 --> 03:17.731
you tell him, can make you!

03:17.765 --> 03:19.166
>> LINDSAY: No. Fine!

03:19.199 --> 03:20.368
(whispers): Fine.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.002
Fine, I'll tell him.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.572
(gasps)

03:24.605 --> 03:26.574
>> BECCA: You can continue the

03:26.607 --> 03:28.909
yoga now.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.913
*

03:35.483 --> 03:36.617
>> * I got three, four gallons

03:36.650 --> 03:37.851
of Hennessy

03:37.885 --> 03:39.086
I got all my dawgs

03:39.119 --> 03:40.087
at the V.I.P... *

03:40.120 --> 03:41.455
>> JIMMY: Cheers.

03:41.489 --> 03:42.623
Fellows! How is it?

03:42.656 --> 03:43.857
Yeah.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.092
Are you here to see a black

03:45.125 --> 03:46.260
movie, as well?

03:46.294 --> 03:47.461
>> HONEY NUTZ: We just call it

03:47.495 --> 03:48.629
a movie.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.863
>> JIMMY: Where's Sam?

03:49.897 --> 03:51.098
>> SHITSTAIN: Had a meeting.

03:51.131 --> 03:52.266
He's on the board of the

03:52.300 --> 03:53.267
Angelino Heights Restoration

03:53.301 --> 03:54.101
Committee.

03:54.134 --> 03:54.935
>> HONEY NUTZ: What are you

03:54.968 --> 03:55.769
doing here?

03:55.803 --> 03:56.604
>> JIMMY: I like to yell out

03:56.637 --> 03:57.971
character inconsistencies,

03:58.005 --> 03:59.607
structural flaws, and keep a

03:59.640 --> 04:00.808
general humorous running

04:00.841 --> 04:01.509
commentary.

04:01.542 --> 04:02.610
This is the only place I can do

04:02.643 --> 04:04.445
that.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.446
>> SHITSTAIN: To be fair, we do

04:05.479 --> 04:06.447
like to go to Beverly Hills to

04:06.480 --> 04:07.448
see a Wes Anderson movie, so...

04:07.481 --> 04:08.449
>> HONEY NUTZ: I like it when

04:08.482 --> 04:09.450
they clap for Bill Murray.

04:09.483 --> 04:10.451
>> SHITSTAIN: Yeah, he's funny.

04:10.484 --> 04:11.452
>> HONEY NUTZ: Yeah, yeah.

04:11.485 --> 04:12.620
>> SHITSTAIN: Okay, he's funny.

04:12.653 --> 04:13.621
>> JIMMY: I've just dropped

04:13.654 --> 04:14.622
Gretchen off at the airport, as

04:14.655 --> 04:16.056
well, so I was in the hood

04:16.089 --> 04:16.824
anyway.

04:16.857 --> 04:17.758
>> HONEY NUTZ: Where does that

04:17.791 --> 04:18.659
bitch think she flying?

04:18.692 --> 04:19.660
We supposed to meet her ass

04:19.693 --> 04:20.361
tomorrow morning.

04:20.394 --> 04:21.395
>> JIMMY: Oh, that's impossible.

04:21.429 --> 04:22.563
She's gone home for, like, a

04:22.596 --> 04:23.564
week.

04:23.597 --> 04:24.565
>> SHITSTAIN: Hey, it's

04:24.598 --> 04:25.299
Shitstain.

04:25.333 --> 04:27.635
Where are you?

04:27.668 --> 04:29.069
Oh, oh, she's here.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.070
Yeah, she's headed to the

04:30.103 --> 04:31.305
museum with her parents.

04:31.339 --> 04:32.473
Yeah, yeah, Sam tried to drag us

04:32.506 --> 04:33.641
to that.

04:33.674 --> 04:34.842
Heard the Rauschenberg pretty

04:34.875 --> 04:36.076
tight.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.144
Okay, word.

04:37.177 --> 04:38.145
>> HONEY NUTZ: Mm. Okay, so she

04:38.178 --> 04:39.146
told you she was flying out of

04:39.179 --> 04:40.147
town?

04:40.180 --> 04:41.148
>> JIMMY: Yeah.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.149
>> HONEY NUTZ: And now she at a

04:42.182 --> 04:42.850
museum?

04:42.883 --> 04:43.784
>> SHITSTAIN: Why would she lie

04:43.817 --> 04:45.486
to you about seeing her folks?

04:45.519 --> 04:46.754
Have you met them?

04:46.787 --> 04:47.955
>> JIMMY: No.

04:47.988 --> 04:48.822
>> HONEY NUTZ: Oh, shit.

04:48.856 --> 04:49.490
(laughs)

04:49.523 --> 04:50.658
>> SHITSTAIN: Yo.

04:50.691 --> 04:51.659
>> HONEY NUTZ: She trying to

04:51.692 --> 04:52.660
hide you!

04:52.693 --> 04:53.461
>> SHITSTAIN: It's just like

04:53.494 --> 04:54.862
Richie and Margot in The Royal

04:54.895 --> 04:55.529
Tenenbaums.

04:55.563 --> 04:56.630
>> HONEY NUTZ: Right. Shit.

04:56.664 --> 04:57.698
Look, I wouldn't want to tell my

04:57.731 --> 04:58.866
mom I'm dating Draco Malfoy,

04:58.899 --> 04:59.667
either.

04:59.700 --> 05:00.434
>> SHITSTAIN: Draco.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.769
>> BOTH: Draco!

05:01.802 --> 05:02.503
>> SHITSTAIN: That's...

05:02.536 --> 05:03.837
(Honey Nutz laughs)

05:03.871 --> 05:04.938
Draco!

05:04.972 --> 05:05.939
It's butter in that?

05:05.973 --> 05:06.940
>> HONEY NUTZ: Oh, yeah, there's

05:06.974 --> 05:07.941
butter in there. Right.

05:07.975 --> 05:08.942
>> SHITSTAIN: Oh, we good, we

05:08.976 --> 05:09.877
good.

05:09.910 --> 05:10.844
>> EDGAR: So, for a while, I

05:10.878 --> 05:12.312
started drinking generic vodka

05:12.346 --> 05:13.847
till I passed out, but then I'd

05:13.881 --> 05:15.215
still have the same nightmares,

05:15.248 --> 05:16.283
only in the dream, I'd be drunk

05:16.316 --> 05:17.518
and way less coordinated.

05:17.551 --> 05:18.686
>> CASEWORKER: I am so sorry,

05:18.719 --> 05:19.387
brother.

05:19.420 --> 05:20.388
>> EDGAR: Yeah, now I'm scared

05:20.421 --> 05:21.855
to go to sleep because I wake up

05:21.889 --> 05:22.723
super angry.

05:22.756 --> 05:23.891
>> CASEWORKER: Sleep to rage.

05:23.924 --> 05:24.958
It's the worst.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.026
I used to tell my wife to

05:26.059 --> 05:27.528
duct-tape pillows to my hands in

05:27.561 --> 05:29.062
case I woke up swinging.

05:29.096 --> 05:32.366
(chuckles)

05:32.400 --> 05:34.201
>> EDGAR: So, my roommate says

05:34.234 --> 05:35.969
that I have a serious problem,

05:36.003 --> 05:37.204
and that you guys should cover

05:37.237 --> 05:38.372
all my meds.

05:38.406 --> 05:39.573
>> CASEWORKER: Usually, I have

05:39.607 --> 05:42.710
to turn down a lot of folks, but

05:42.743 --> 05:44.077
you seem like a perfect

05:44.111 --> 05:46.046
candidate for help.

05:46.079 --> 05:47.047
Real quick, who is this

05:47.080 --> 05:48.048
roommate?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.049
>> EDGAR: Oh, Jimmy.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.050
He's a novelist from Britain.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.051
He lets me live with him in

05:51.084 --> 05:52.052
exchange for cooking and

05:52.085 --> 05:53.053
housework.

05:53.086 --> 05:54.054
>> CASEWORKER: You have a job?

05:54.087 --> 05:55.055
Tight.

05:55.088 --> 05:56.223
It can be so tough for vets to

05:56.256 --> 05:56.924
find work...

05:56.957 --> 05:58.025
>> EDGAR: Oh, no, he doesn't pay

05:58.058 --> 05:58.759
me.

05:58.792 --> 06:00.060
>> CASEWORKER: Cool.

06:00.093 --> 06:01.862
So he thinks the U.S. government

06:01.895 --> 06:02.930
should cover your expenses...

06:02.963 --> 06:03.664
>> EDGAR: Mm-hmm.

06:03.697 --> 06:04.665
>> CASEWORKER: ...while you work

06:04.698 --> 06:05.499
for free?

06:05.533 --> 06:06.900
>> EDGAR: Oh, no.

06:06.934 --> 06:08.569
He's my best friend.

06:08.602 --> 06:10.070
>> CASEWORKER: Cool.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.606
Okay, very cool.

06:12.640 --> 06:14.442
Soldier, have you ever heard of

06:14.475 --> 06:16.176
Domestic Civilian Transference

06:16.209 --> 06:17.210
Syndrome By Proxy?

06:17.244 --> 06:18.211
>> EDGAR: Mm-mm.

06:18.245 --> 06:19.212
>> CASEWORKER: It's my only

06:19.246 --> 06:20.581
copy, but trust me, it's highly

06:20.614 --> 06:21.582
true.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.751
You need to nip this in the bud.

06:23.784 --> 06:26.253
Tonight, you sit this so-called

06:26.286 --> 06:27.855
roommate down and you say, "Hey,

06:27.888 --> 06:30.123
man, I was in the shit while you

06:30.157 --> 06:31.959
were at home watching telly.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.427
If my nightmares are too scary

06:33.461 --> 06:34.428
for you, maybe you need to pay

06:34.462 --> 06:35.429
for my meds!"

06:35.463 --> 06:36.430
>> EDGAR: Damn straight.

06:36.464 --> 06:37.431
>> CASEWORKER: Yeah, you tell

06:37.465 --> 06:38.432
him that.

06:38.466 --> 06:40.267
>> EDGAR: I will tell him that.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.435
I will!

06:41.469 --> 06:42.603
Thank you.

06:42.636 --> 06:43.771
>> CASEWORKER: You're welcome,

06:43.804 --> 06:46.807
soldier.

06:46.840 --> 06:48.041
>> EDGAR (mutters): Watching

06:48.075 --> 06:49.276
telly...

06:49.309 --> 06:51.278
(muttering continues)

06:51.311 --> 06:53.481
>> CASEWORKER: Number 97.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.560
>> PAUL: You're home.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.561
>> LINDSAY: We need to talk

07:07.595 --> 07:09.229
about something.

07:09.262 --> 07:12.432
This has been eating away at me,

07:12.466 --> 07:15.035
but the fact is...

07:20.974 --> 07:22.776
...I realized I don't really

07:22.810 --> 07:24.244
know what you do all day.

07:24.277 --> 07:25.245
(chuckles)

07:25.278 --> 07:26.413
Tell me about this...

07:26.446 --> 07:27.615
weird thing.

07:27.648 --> 07:28.782
>> PAUL: The recumbent?

07:28.816 --> 07:29.983
>> LINDSAY: Yeah.

07:30.017 --> 07:31.251
How does it work?

07:31.284 --> 07:32.753
>> PAUL: Well, if you really

07:32.786 --> 07:35.155
want the total experience, I can

07:35.188 --> 07:36.590
always pull out the tandem.

07:36.624 --> 07:40.060
>> LINDSAY: The what now?

07:44.164 --> 07:45.332
>> PAUL: A semi-reclined

07:45.365 --> 07:46.934
position provides broader

07:46.967 --> 07:48.769
distribution of body weight, and

07:48.802 --> 07:50.337
allows some better blood flow to

07:50.370 --> 07:51.605
the anus and testicles.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.641
Aw, heck yeah!

07:53.674 --> 07:55.008
Here's the gang!

07:55.042 --> 07:56.944
Mimi, Connor, this is my wife

07:56.977 --> 07:58.278
Lindsay.

07:58.311 --> 07:59.479
(chuckles)

07:59.513 --> 08:00.648
Last one to Starbucks is an

08:00.681 --> 08:01.815
uprighter!

08:01.849 --> 08:04.217
(groans loudly)

08:04.251 --> 08:06.053
We should let them win.

08:06.086 --> 08:07.655
Connor's life-coaching business

08:07.688 --> 08:09.156
just went under, and Mimi has

08:09.189 --> 08:10.323
impetigo.

08:10.357 --> 08:11.725
All right, here I come, Mimi.

08:11.759 --> 08:12.660
Look out.

08:12.693 --> 08:13.661
(bicycle bell dings)

08:13.694 --> 08:15.663
(chuckles)

08:21.702 --> 08:22.670
>> JIMMY: Nice use of negative

08:22.703 --> 08:23.671
space.

08:23.704 --> 08:24.672
>> GRETCHEN: What are you doing

08:24.705 --> 08:25.673
here?!

08:25.706 --> 08:26.674
>> JIMMY: What are you doing

08:26.707 --> 08:27.675
here?

08:27.708 --> 08:28.842
I just dropped you at the

08:28.876 --> 08:29.843
airport!

08:29.877 --> 08:30.510
>> GRETCHEN: What?

08:30.544 --> 08:31.511
No, you didn't.

08:31.545 --> 08:32.312
>> JIMMY: Yes, I did.

08:32.345 --> 08:33.346
>> GRETCHEN: What?! What are you

08:33.380 --> 08:34.682
talking about?

08:34.715 --> 08:37.918
No, that was a dream you had.

08:37.951 --> 08:38.852
All right, fine.

08:38.886 --> 08:40.353
This is so dumb.

08:40.387 --> 08:43.557
So, I am waiting at the gate as

08:43.591 --> 08:44.858
they deplane the flight before

08:44.892 --> 08:46.694
mine, and all of a sudden, guess

08:46.727 --> 08:48.929
who gets off?

08:48.962 --> 08:50.197
My friggin' parents!

08:50.230 --> 08:52.365
And I'm like, "What?!

08:52.399 --> 08:54.868
I thought you guys wanted me to

08:54.902 --> 08:56.036
come visit."

08:56.069 --> 08:58.271
So dumb.

08:58.305 --> 09:00.107
Gretchen, you nerd.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.374
>> JIMMY: Stop.

09:01.408 --> 09:02.542
>> GRETCHEN: All right, I lied.

09:02.576 --> 09:03.711
But Vanessa and Fred are such a

09:03.744 --> 09:04.912
bummer!

09:04.945 --> 09:06.113
I didn't want to subject you to

09:06.146 --> 09:08.081
their passive-aggressive shit.

09:08.115 --> 09:09.382
>> JIMMY: Right, so you packed

09:09.416 --> 09:11.018
and had me drop you off at the

09:11.051 --> 09:12.219
airport?

09:12.252 --> 09:14.722
>> GRETCHEN: Did I really pack?

09:14.755 --> 09:15.723
I just put some damp laundry and

09:15.756 --> 09:16.724
toilet paper into a suitcase.

09:16.757 --> 09:17.725
Open your eyes, Jimmy.

09:17.758 --> 09:18.926
>> JIMMY: Right, well, I have to

09:18.959 --> 09:20.127
meet the people that created

09:20.160 --> 09:21.294
this nightmare of a person.

09:21.328 --> 09:22.562
>> GRETCHEN: Oh, I would, but we

09:22.596 --> 09:23.731
have to leave.

09:23.764 --> 09:24.898
I'm taking them to the airport.

09:24.932 --> 09:26.099
>> JIMMY: I thought you just

09:26.133 --> 09:27.100
picked them up.

09:27.134 --> 09:28.101
>> GRETCHEN: It turns out they

09:28.135 --> 09:28.969
can't stay.

09:29.002 --> 09:30.403
Dad is having emergency back

09:30.437 --> 09:31.739
surgery tomorrow at Johns

09:31.772 --> 09:32.572
Hopkins.

09:32.606 --> 09:34.742
He is having his L7 fused, and

09:34.775 --> 09:36.777
they just had a cancellation.

09:36.810 --> 09:38.245
The procedure's experimental,

09:38.278 --> 09:39.747
but Dr. Pablo's the best, and a

09:39.780 --> 09:40.948
slot just opened up.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.149
I am serious.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.483
>> JIMMY: Mm. Well, I'm not

09:43.516 --> 09:45.252
leaving until you produce these

09:45.285 --> 09:46.654
monsters.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.288
>> GRETCHEN: All right.

09:48.321 --> 09:51.258
You asked for it.

09:58.465 --> 09:59.633
>> JIMMY: You're not art.

09:59.667 --> 10:00.801
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy?

10:00.834 --> 10:02.502
Vanessa and Fred.

10:02.535 --> 10:03.771
>> MOM: Jimmy, hi.

10:03.804 --> 10:04.938
>> JIMMY: Hi.

10:04.972 --> 10:06.106
>> MOM: Nice to meet you.

10:06.139 --> 10:07.307
So sorry we have to run.

10:07.340 --> 10:08.308
>> DAD: I'm having a surgery,

10:08.341 --> 10:09.176
Jimmy.

10:09.209 --> 10:10.610
>> JIMMY: Yes. Yes, Gretchen

10:10.644 --> 10:11.278
said.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.914
Okay, good luck with that.

10:13.947 --> 10:16.817
So glad I got to meet you.

10:16.850 --> 10:17.851
So I'll see you later?

10:17.885 --> 10:19.119
>> GRETCHEN: Uh, nah, I have a

10:19.152 --> 10:20.120
work thing.

10:20.153 --> 10:21.121
Call you tomorrow?

10:21.154 --> 10:23.123
>> JIMMY: Okay.

10:34.134 --> 10:35.102
>> GRETCHEN (echoing): My dad's

10:35.135 --> 10:38.471
having back surgery...

10:38.505 --> 10:42.042
at Johns Hopkins.

10:42.075 --> 10:45.178
He's having his L7 fused.

10:47.380 --> 10:50.951
Dr. Pablo's the best.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.952
Back surgery...

10:51.985 --> 10:52.953
Johns Hopkins...

10:52.986 --> 10:53.721
Back surgery...

10:53.754 --> 10:54.387
Johns Hopkins...

10:54.421 --> 10:55.388
Back surgery...

10:55.422 --> 10:56.656
John Hopkins...

10:56.690 --> 11:00.127
Dr. Pablo...

11:00.160 --> 11:02.830
Procedure's experimental...

11:02.863 --> 11:05.498
experimental... experimental.

11:08.836 --> 11:09.803
>> DAD: Well, they said that

11:09.837 --> 11:10.804
it's, like, all tropical plants

11:10.838 --> 11:11.504
they've got.

11:11.538 --> 11:12.505
>> MOM: Oh, okay.

11:12.539 --> 11:13.140
>> JIMMY: Who are you?

11:13.173 --> 11:14.141
Where's Gretchen?

11:14.174 --> 11:14.808
>> MOM: Oh, look, hon.

11:14.842 --> 11:15.743
It's the guy with the accent.

11:15.776 --> 11:16.744
>> DAD: That lady said we were

11:16.777 --> 11:17.745
on a hidden camera show.

11:17.778 --> 11:18.712
What channel will this be on?

11:18.746 --> 11:19.747
>> MOM: Oh, I bet it's nine.

11:19.780 --> 11:20.748
>> DAD: Four? No, four, right?

11:20.781 --> 11:21.915
>> MOM: No. No, I bet you a week

11:21.949 --> 11:22.916
of dishes it's channel nine.

11:22.950 --> 11:23.917
>> DAD: Nine?!

11:23.951 --> 11:24.918
>> MOM: Nine. Nine. Nine.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.920
>> DAD: Four. Four. Four.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.327
>> PAUL: And as I like to say,

11:34.361 --> 11:35.996
once you pedal on your back,

11:36.029 --> 11:37.564
you never go back.

11:37.597 --> 11:38.766
To pedaling normally.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.000
(chuckles)

11:40.033 --> 11:41.234
(Lindsay laughs weakly)

11:41.268 --> 11:42.402
>> LINDSAY: This is really nice.

11:42.435 --> 11:43.570
>> PAUL: Well, there's more

11:43.603 --> 11:45.238
where that came from.

11:45.272 --> 11:47.240
Were you serious about seeing

11:47.274 --> 11:50.778
what I do for fun?

11:50.811 --> 11:52.379
>> LINDSAY: Yes.

11:52.412 --> 11:54.514
>> PAUL (laughs): Well, hold

11:54.547 --> 11:55.749
on to your hat.

11:55.783 --> 11:57.250
(Lindsay groans)

11:57.284 --> 11:59.252
(engine sputtering)

12:04.057 --> 12:05.358
Ladies and gentlemen, we've

12:05.392 --> 12:08.261
reached an altitude of 75 feet.

12:08.295 --> 12:09.629
If you look out the right side

12:09.662 --> 12:11.131
of the plane, you can see the

12:11.164 --> 12:12.365
San Gabriels.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.234
Those on the left can catch a

12:14.267 --> 12:16.303
glimpse of my beautiful wife

12:16.336 --> 12:18.271
Lindsay. (chuckles)

12:18.305 --> 12:19.439
>> DARREN (over radio): Paul,

12:19.472 --> 12:20.407
you know that sub-hundred

12:20.440 --> 12:21.741
elevation is for westbound

12:21.775 --> 12:22.709
traffic only.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.443
>> PAUL: Roger that.

12:23.476 --> 12:25.312
Sorry, Darren.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.948
Climbing.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.984
Did you know that four American

12:31.018 --> 12:34.121
presidents were home-brewers?

12:34.154 --> 12:36.924
Can you guess?

12:36.957 --> 12:39.092
George Washington, Thomas

12:39.126 --> 12:42.629
Jefferson, James Madison,

12:42.662 --> 12:44.631
and...?

12:47.500 --> 12:51.138
The answer is Barack Obama!

12:51.171 --> 12:52.505
Uh...

12:52.539 --> 12:53.974
Lindsay?

12:54.007 --> 12:55.508
>> LINDSAY: Huh?

12:55.542 --> 12:56.776
Oh.

12:56.810 --> 12:58.311
I'm fine.

12:58.345 --> 12:59.813
Keep talking beer.

12:59.847 --> 13:01.815
(Paul sighs)

13:04.784 --> 13:05.986
>> EDGAR: Jimmy, we need to

13:06.019 --> 13:07.154
talk.

13:07.187 --> 13:08.856
>> JIMMY: Gretchen was so scared

13:08.889 --> 13:10.523
of me meeting her parents that

13:10.557 --> 13:12.592
she hired fake parents.

13:12.625 --> 13:13.927
Am I really Draco Malfoy?

13:13.961 --> 13:15.162
>> EDGAR: I just talked to the

13:15.195 --> 13:16.329
V.A., and...

13:16.363 --> 13:17.931
Am I just some unpaid servant

13:17.965 --> 13:19.099
who lives here for free?

13:19.132 --> 13:20.333
>> JIMMY: That's a concise way

13:20.367 --> 13:21.501
of putting it.

13:21.534 --> 13:22.669
>> EDGAR: My caseworker says

13:22.702 --> 13:23.871
maybe you should be paying for

13:23.904 --> 13:25.105
my meds.

13:25.138 --> 13:26.339
>> JIMMY: Right. Listen to me,

13:26.373 --> 13:27.507
my friend.

13:27.540 --> 13:29.943
You bought into a long con.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.845
Society screwed you over, and we

13:31.879 --> 13:33.013
owe you for that.

13:33.046 --> 13:35.215
I, personally, do not owe you,

13:35.248 --> 13:36.549
but a sort of collective "we"

13:36.583 --> 13:37.717
does.

13:37.750 --> 13:39.352
And you need your meds so you

13:39.386 --> 13:40.854
can shake off some of the damage

13:40.888 --> 13:42.956
done by Cheney's fictional

13:42.990 --> 13:44.524
yellowcake uranium.

13:44.557 --> 13:46.826
So, you turn around, you go back

13:46.860 --> 13:48.962
to the V.A., and you demand your

13:48.996 --> 13:50.998
due!

13:59.739 --> 14:00.707
(Gretchen sighs)

14:00.740 --> 14:01.708
>> FRED: 15, love.

14:01.741 --> 14:02.709
Let's go, sweetie.

14:02.742 --> 14:03.710
>> VANESSA: Gretchen, your

14:03.743 --> 14:04.711
backhand has completely

14:04.744 --> 14:05.712
disintegrated.

14:05.745 --> 14:06.646
>> GRETCHEN: Sorry, Mommy.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.647
>> VANESSA: Seven years of

14:07.680 --> 14:08.748
training with Andrés for

14:08.781 --> 14:10.750
nothing. (scoffs)

14:13.020 --> 14:13.987
Ready?

14:14.021 --> 14:15.488
>> FRED: You can do it, sweetie.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.490
>> GRETCHEN: Sorry, Mommy.

14:17.524 --> 14:19.459
(Jimmy mouthing)

14:27.800 --> 14:29.903
>> JIMMY: Hello, darling.

14:29.937 --> 14:31.071
Sorry I'm late.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.772
Mwah. Hello.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.442
I'm Jimmy Shive-Overly.

14:35.475 --> 14:36.676
Gretchen's boyfriend.

14:36.709 --> 14:37.844
>> FRED: Oh, well, hello.

14:37.877 --> 14:39.012
I'm Fred.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.247
>> VANESSA: Vanessa.

14:40.280 --> 14:41.414
Please join us.

14:41.448 --> 14:42.916
In her typical way, Gretchen has

14:42.950 --> 14:44.184
told us nothing about you.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.018
>> JIMMY: Ugh!

14:45.052 --> 14:46.586
(chuckles)

14:46.619 --> 14:47.754
Milk.

14:47.787 --> 14:50.023
Gretchen-- always ordering milk.

14:50.057 --> 14:51.524
Sometimes double milks.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.093
I actually sometimes wonder if

14:53.126 --> 14:55.595
maybe she drinks too much milk.

14:55.628 --> 14:56.763
(Jimmy laughs)

14:56.796 --> 14:58.765
>> VANESSA: So, Jimmy, where are

14:58.798 --> 14:59.933
you from?

14:59.967 --> 15:01.134
>> GRETCHEN: London.

15:01.168 --> 15:02.369
The fancy part.

15:02.402 --> 15:03.603
>> FRED: And what do you do?

15:03.636 --> 15:05.472
>> GRETCHEN: He's a novelist.

15:05.505 --> 15:07.107
Published, very well-regarded.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.108
Jimmy...

15:08.141 --> 15:09.042
>> VANESSA: And, Gretchen,

15:09.076 --> 15:10.377
you're still doing that music

15:10.410 --> 15:11.044
thing?

15:11.078 --> 15:11.979
>> FRED: Who's that skinny boy

15:12.012 --> 15:12.980
you represent?

15:13.013 --> 15:13.947
>> JIMMY: Shitstain?

15:13.981 --> 15:15.282
>> GRETCHEN: No!

15:15.315 --> 15:17.884
Josh Groban is who he meant.

15:17.917 --> 15:18.885
>> VANESSA: How did you two

15:18.918 --> 15:19.886
meet?

15:19.919 --> 15:21.888
>> GRETCHEN: At a fund-raiser.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.490
It was...

15:23.523 --> 15:24.724
animal-related.

15:24.757 --> 15:25.892
>> FRED: Ah, Gretchen does so

15:25.925 --> 15:26.994
much charity work.

15:27.027 --> 15:27.995
>> JIMMY: Oh, she does love

15:28.028 --> 15:28.996
animals.

15:29.029 --> 15:29.997
Tell your mom how you got your

15:30.030 --> 15:30.998
cat.

15:31.031 --> 15:31.898
>> GRETCHEN: Jimmy, it was so

15:31.931 --> 15:33.100
nice of you to stop by, but I

15:33.133 --> 15:34.101
know you have that meeting.

15:34.134 --> 15:34.801
I'll walk you out.

15:34.834 --> 15:36.503
>> VANESSA: What meeting?

15:36.536 --> 15:38.338
>> GRETCHEN: Movie producers.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.472
From Hollywood.

15:39.506 --> 15:40.740
They are turning his book into a

15:40.773 --> 15:43.810
movie starring Zach Braff and

15:43.843 --> 15:44.978
that woman from the show you

15:45.012 --> 15:45.979
like.

15:46.013 --> 15:46.980
>> VANESSA: Scandal?

15:47.014 --> 15:48.148
>> GRETCHEN: Yes, Scandal.

15:48.181 --> 15:49.649
Jimmy, I bet that driver has

15:49.682 --> 15:51.318
been waiting outside for a while

15:51.351 --> 15:52.152
now.

15:52.185 --> 15:54.154
You should go.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.124
>> JIMMY: Okay.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.126
Nice to meet you both.

16:02.729 --> 16:03.863
Okay, none of this is true.

16:03.896 --> 16:04.864
I'm not from the fancy part of

16:04.897 --> 16:05.865
London, I'm from the bad part

16:05.898 --> 16:06.866
of Manchester.

16:06.899 --> 16:07.867
>> GRETCHEN: Stop.

16:07.900 --> 16:08.868
>> JIMMY: I am an author.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.037
Talented but wildly

16:10.070 --> 16:11.604
underappreciated.

16:11.638 --> 16:13.173
I had to follow Gretchen here

16:13.206 --> 16:14.441
today, only to witness her

16:14.474 --> 16:15.542
mother bullying her during a

16:15.575 --> 16:16.543
tennis match.

16:16.576 --> 16:17.544
You're right about her

16:17.577 --> 16:18.545
backhand, by the way-- it's

16:18.578 --> 16:19.546
appalling.

16:19.579 --> 16:20.547
>> VANESSA: You're telling me

16:20.580 --> 16:21.548
how to speak to Gretchen?

16:21.581 --> 16:22.549
>> JIMMY: You've never spoken to

16:22.582 --> 16:24.017
the real Gretchen.

16:24.051 --> 16:25.118
The real Gretchen runs publicity

16:25.152 --> 16:26.519
for some of the biggest rap acts

16:26.553 --> 16:28.055
in town.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.222
The real Gretchen doesn't drink

16:29.256 --> 16:31.724
milk or take ballet classes.

16:31.758 --> 16:32.959
In fact, she just cancelled her

16:32.992 --> 16:34.027
gym membership so she'd have

16:34.061 --> 16:35.128
money for cigarettes.

16:35.162 --> 16:36.129
>> FRED: You smoke?

16:36.163 --> 16:37.130
>> JIMMY: Sure, she hasn't been

16:37.164 --> 16:38.531
to the dentist in years and

16:38.565 --> 16:40.533
lives off 7-Eleven hot dogs, but

16:40.567 --> 16:44.071
she is brave and spontaneous.

16:44.104 --> 16:46.539
And that Gretchen is so

16:46.573 --> 16:48.475
paralyzed with the fear of

16:48.508 --> 16:50.077
disappointing you that you don't

16:50.110 --> 16:52.212
actually know her at all.

16:52.245 --> 16:53.480
I feel sorry for you two.

16:53.513 --> 16:54.481
You will never know the

16:54.514 --> 16:58.051
brilliant, beautiful mess that

16:58.085 --> 17:00.620
is your daughter.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.759
(Gretchen chuckles nervously)

17:10.597 --> 17:13.400
>> GRETCHEN: Daddy, I...

17:13.433 --> 17:15.068
>> FRED: (sighs) Just take us

17:15.102 --> 17:16.936
back to our hotel.

17:16.969 --> 17:18.938
And...

17:18.971 --> 17:21.308
finish your milk.

17:38.225 --> 17:39.058
>> CASEWORKER: I really wish I

17:39.092 --> 17:40.059
could help, but funds are tight.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.261
Congress wants to pay for the

17:41.294 --> 17:42.629
war, not the casualties.

17:42.662 --> 17:43.630
>> EDGAR: I'm not asking for a

17:43.663 --> 17:44.897
medal or a parade, just a good

17:44.931 --> 17:47.600
night's sleep.

17:47.634 --> 17:49.102
(caseworker sighs)

17:49.136 --> 17:51.304
>> CASEWORKER: Uncle! I give in.

17:51.338 --> 17:52.305
(chuckles) I will fill out your

17:52.339 --> 17:53.306
paperwork and find the money for

17:53.340 --> 17:54.307
your meds.

17:54.341 --> 17:55.308
>> EDGAR: Thank you.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.309
>> CASEWORKER: Where is it that

17:56.343 --> 17:57.310
you're living?

17:57.344 --> 17:58.311
>> EDGAR: Uh, Silver Lake.

17:58.345 --> 17:59.579
>> CASEWORKER: Silver Lake.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.281
Ooh-la-la.

18:01.314 --> 18:03.216
Hey, Jerry, bad news, you're

18:03.250 --> 18:04.951
gonna have to turn in your hook.

18:04.984 --> 18:05.952
>> JERRY: But-but I use it to

18:05.985 --> 18:06.953
pick things up.

18:06.986 --> 18:07.954
>> CASEWORKER: No, man.

18:07.987 --> 18:08.955
Stuff's gonna stay on the

18:08.988 --> 18:09.956
ground.

18:09.989 --> 18:11.458
This hipster's having bad

18:11.491 --> 18:13.860
"dweams."

18:20.600 --> 18:22.969
>> EDGAR: I didn't...

18:28.040 --> 18:29.742
(gunfire over TV)

18:29.776 --> 18:32.145
(knocking)

18:34.181 --> 18:35.148
>> GRETCHEN: Why would you do

18:35.182 --> 18:36.149
that?!

18:36.183 --> 18:37.184
My dad didn't say another word

18:37.217 --> 18:38.251
to me in the car, and now

18:38.285 --> 18:39.586
they're changing their flight so

18:39.619 --> 18:40.620
they leave tomorrow!

18:40.653 --> 18:41.621
What is wrong with you?!

18:41.654 --> 18:42.622
>> JIMMY: Sorry, wouldn't you

18:42.655 --> 18:43.623
rather have a fractured,

18:43.656 --> 18:45.091
combative relationship with your

18:45.124 --> 18:46.459
parents that's based on truth

18:46.493 --> 18:48.695
than this pleasant artificial

18:48.728 --> 18:49.696
relationship based on lies?

18:49.729 --> 18:50.697
>> GRETCHEN: No.

18:50.730 --> 18:51.698
>> JIMMY: Well, then you

18:51.731 --> 18:52.699
should've been more explicit

18:52.732 --> 18:53.700
about that.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.001
>> GRETCHEN: They're my family!

18:55.034 --> 18:56.703
I get to lie to them till I'm

18:56.736 --> 18:57.704
old and they're dead, and you

18:57.737 --> 18:58.705
don't get a vote!

18:58.738 --> 18:59.706
I would never tell your dad to

18:59.739 --> 19:00.707
read your book.

19:00.740 --> 19:01.708
>> JIMMY: Yeah, because he

19:01.741 --> 19:02.709
wouldn't let you through the

19:02.742 --> 19:03.976
door 'cause you're a redhead and

19:04.010 --> 19:05.345
he's hated the Irish ever since

19:05.378 --> 19:06.613
the IRA blew up his favorite

19:06.646 --> 19:07.614
chip shop.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.015
Look, I'm sorry.

19:09.048 --> 19:10.683
Forgive me for valuing honesty.

19:10.717 --> 19:11.684
>> GRETCHEN: This is about you

19:11.718 --> 19:12.952
controlling and bullying

19:12.985 --> 19:14.554
everybody to behave the way you

19:14.587 --> 19:15.622
think they should.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.723
I knew you were insensitive and

19:16.756 --> 19:17.957
manipulative, but you're mean,

19:17.990 --> 19:18.991
Jimmy.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.193
You're a mean person.

19:20.227 --> 19:21.194
>> JIMMY: Well, at least I am a

19:21.228 --> 19:23.563
person!

19:34.507 --> 19:36.876
(sniffles)

19:59.131 --> 20:01.100
*

20:15.482 --> 20:16.449
>> JIMMY: Hey, um...

20:16.483 --> 20:17.450
>> GRETCHEN: I'm done.

20:17.484 --> 20:18.451
I'm tagging out.

20:18.485 --> 20:19.452
>> JIMMY: What?

20:19.486 --> 20:20.720
Of-of this argument?

20:20.753 --> 20:21.921
>> GRETCHEN: No, Jimmy.

20:21.954 --> 20:22.922
Of this.

20:22.955 --> 20:24.090
I told you I don't do

20:24.123 --> 20:25.558
relationships, and yet here we

20:25.592 --> 20:26.959
are in one.

20:26.993 --> 20:29.629
I feel... I feel like this train

20:29.662 --> 20:31.598
is speeding up, and this may be

20:31.631 --> 20:32.865
my last chance to hop off before

20:32.899 --> 20:34.634
any serious injury.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.636
>> JIMMY: Speak English.

20:38.671 --> 20:40.773
>> GRETCHEN: Good-bye, Jimmy.

20:40.807 --> 20:43.209
Sorry!

20:43.242 --> 20:45.578
You're right, I'm not a person.

20:48.948 --> 20:50.917
(door slams)

20:55.788 --> 20:57.156
>> PAUL: Those three stars are

20:57.189 --> 20:59.426
Orion's Belt.

20:59.459 --> 21:02.161
See how he looks like a man with

21:02.194 --> 21:03.262
a club?

21:03.296 --> 21:04.263
(Australian accent): G'day,

21:04.297 --> 21:05.264
Linds.

21:05.298 --> 21:08.100
I'm Orion, the mighty hunter.

21:08.134 --> 21:10.102
(both laugh)

21:13.640 --> 21:15.274
Hmm. What was that for?

21:15.308 --> 21:16.743
>> LINDSAY: Nothing.

21:16.776 --> 21:19.812
Just... you.

21:19.846 --> 21:21.614
You weirdo.

21:21.648 --> 21:23.616
(phone chimes)

21:26.619 --> 21:27.920
(gasps)

21:27.954 --> 21:30.256
I'm sorry. I have to go.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.024
Gretchen needs me.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.793
Thanks for the day.

21:33.826 --> 21:35.828
Have fun with your stars.

21:40.367 --> 21:41.634
>> PAUL: They're everyone's

21:41.668 --> 21:44.036
stars.

21:53.179 --> 21:56.182
(door opens, closes)

21:56.215 --> 21:58.818
>> EDGAR: Where's Gretchen?

21:58.851 --> 22:02.722
And why are you cooking?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.290
>> JIMMY: It's over.

22:04.323 --> 22:05.291
Lasted longer than anyone

22:05.324 --> 22:06.659
would've guessed, huh?

22:06.693 --> 22:08.995
>> EDGAR: No.

22:09.028 --> 22:10.463
What happened?

22:10.497 --> 22:11.464
>> JIMMY: Uh, can we not talk

22:11.498 --> 22:12.465
about it?

22:12.499 --> 22:14.300
I-I need to just...

22:14.333 --> 22:16.235
just not.

22:16.268 --> 22:17.537
(sighs)

22:17.570 --> 22:18.971
You hungry?

22:19.005 --> 22:21.374
>> EDGAR: Yeah, I-I could eat.

22:25.845 --> 22:26.913
>> JIMMY: No go on the pills,

22:26.946 --> 22:27.914
huh?

22:27.947 --> 22:29.749
>> EDGAR: (scoffs) Nope.

22:29.782 --> 22:30.850
>> JIMMY: We'll go down there

22:30.883 --> 22:31.918
tomorrow and sort it out.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.553
>> EDGAR: R-Really?

22:33.586 --> 22:35.555
Thanks.

22:37.757 --> 22:39.158
>> JIMMY: I have no idea how to

22:39.191 --> 22:40.159
cook.

22:40.192 --> 22:41.160
>> EDGAR: What have you been

22:41.193 --> 22:42.395
doing all this time?

22:42.429 --> 22:44.063
>> JIMMY: Just, uh, stirring

22:44.096 --> 22:47.500
ketchup in a pan.

22:47.534 --> 22:50.937
>> EDGAR: Okay. Okay. Um...

22:50.970 --> 22:52.905
that's a good base.

22:52.939 --> 22:53.906
>> JIMMY: Yeah?

22:53.940 --> 22:54.907
>> EDGAR: Yeah.

22:54.941 --> 22:56.443
Uh, pinch of salt, throw it in

22:56.476 --> 22:57.444
there.

22:57.477 --> 22:58.545
>> JIMMY: Pinch-pinch of salt.

22:58.578 --> 22:59.612
>> EDGAR: And then add a little

22:59.646 --> 23:01.614
bit of, uh, olive oil, two,

23:01.648 --> 23:02.615
three counts worth.

23:02.649 --> 23:03.916
Now stir it in.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.084
Stir it in nice and gently.

23:05.117 --> 23:06.953
And, uh, keep stirring, keep

23:06.986 --> 23:08.955
stirring.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.724
* And may

23:11.758 --> 23:15.528
I call you baby?

23:15.562 --> 23:18.765
For the rest

23:18.798 --> 23:22.669
* Of my days?

23:26.906 --> 23:29.075
* And do

23:29.108 --> 23:31.077
You think I'm crazy... *
