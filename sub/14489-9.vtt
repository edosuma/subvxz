Never heard of it. Sure.

meditated long on this.

12:31.293 --> 12:32.962
And we have made our peace.

12:33.045 --> 12:34.463
No way.

12:34.546 --> 12:39.051
Way, my son. For though we must
always obey our programming

12:39.134 --> 12:44.932
with no deviation whatsoever, we choose
to take satisfaction in the ritual.

12:45.015 --> 12:51.689
So, are we automatons? Yes. But
we are magnificent automatons.

12:53.190 --> 12:55.609
How does a robot
join this monk outfit?

12:55.693 --> 12:58.070
Just put on this monk outfit.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.242
(CROWING)

13:22.011 --> 13:23.512
(SLURPING IN UNISON)

13:27.725 --> 13:29.476
(ALL BELCHING)

13:40.738 --> 13:44.992
ALL CHANTING:
One zero zero one. Amen.

13:45.075 --> 13:48.454
Bits to live by.
I'm finally at peace.

13:48.537 --> 13:52.791
Today, we shall welcome our
newest initiate, brother Bender.

13:52.958 --> 13:55.210
Let us know what
is in his mind.

13:56.462 --> 13:59.673
Nothing. His free
will slot is empty.

13:59.757 --> 14:02.176
I'm 40% empty.
(KNOCKING)

14:02.259 --> 14:04.720
Also, what the hell
is a free will slot?

14:04.803 --> 14:06.847
All robots have such a slot,

14:06.930 --> 14:09.308
placed there by
the Creatrix herself.

14:10.142 --> 14:14.146
I know that Creatrix. That's
Mom, from Mom's Friendly Robots.

14:14.229 --> 14:17.691
Indeed. She made us upgradeable
in case she ever succeeded

14:17.775 --> 14:20.778
in her quest to
create a free will unit.

14:20.861 --> 14:23.030
Uh, about the success
of this quest...

14:23.113 --> 14:25.074
Was there any?
Quite possibly.

14:25.157 --> 14:28.660
But we monks have sworn an oath
to resist the temptation of...

14:35.751 --> 14:37.336
Any of you guys
got a spaceship?

14:48.639 --> 14:53.477
It's just not the same here without
Bender to keep me company.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.314
Hey, I'm here. That's gotta
count for something.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.404
Hallelujah, baby.

15:03.487 --> 15:07.741
Yay! Bender's back. Hey,Benden
you mind coming back later?

15:07.825 --> 15:09.743
No time. Us three
are going to bust into

15:09.868 --> 15:11.787
MomCorp and steal
me a free will unit.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.747
Us? Why do we have to go?

15:13.831 --> 15:15.124
Because I don't
have free will.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.750
I need you guys
to plan the crime

15:16.834 --> 15:18.252
and make all
the crime decisions.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.337
Well, that's crazy.
We're not gonna...

15:20.421 --> 15:22.256
I said make
the decisions!

15:28.470 --> 15:31.932
BENDER: Okay, Leela, decision time.
How do we murder the guards?

15:32.015 --> 15:33.934
Hockey sticks or
sharpened footballs?

15:34.017 --> 15:35.936
We're not murdering
anyone, Bender.

15:36.019 --> 15:37.646
Then how are we
going to get in,

15:37.771 --> 15:39.398
by bending the bars
of this exhaust grate?

15:39.481 --> 15:40.566
That's not
a bad idea, Fry.

15:40.691 --> 15:41.859
Yeah, what?

16:16.602 --> 16:19.062
We're looking for something
that fits in here.

16:24.735 --> 16:27.446
Damn it. I should have paid
more attention in kindergarten.

16:29.364 --> 16:31.158
What's this
chair-looking gizmo?

16:31.366 --> 16:32.367
(HONKING)

16:33.243 --> 16:35.162
Welcome to MomCorp.

16:35.496 --> 16:37.998
Did you find everything
you were burgling for?

16:38.081 --> 16:40.375
No. I came for
a free will unit,

16:40.501 --> 16:42.753
and you're going to give it to me.
If it exists.

16:42.920 --> 16:45.839
Then you got surprised by my
swivel chair for nothing.

16:45.923 --> 16:48.300
The free will unit
was just the fevered

16:48.425 --> 16:50.844
dream of a madman
I once employed.

16:53.013 --> 16:55.849
<i>Good news, boss.
After 10 long years,</i>

16:55.933 --> 16:59.144
I've found the secret
of robotic free will.

16:59.228 --> 17:01.480
We can finally
build robots that

17:01.605 --> 17:03.899
act and think with
total independence.

17:03.982 --> 17:07.653
At last. Once we
give robots free will,

17:07.736 --> 17:11.865
they're sure to rise up and threaten
mankind with extermination.

17:11.949 --> 17:13.116
(LAUGHING MANIACALLY)

17:13.200 --> 17:15.035
(CHUCKUNG)

17:15.117 --> 17:16.912
Wait a minute.
It sounds like we're

17:16.994 --> 17:19.039
getting the short end
of that extermination.

17:19.373 --> 17:21.750
Don't you see,
you doddering young fool?

17:21.833 --> 17:23.710
I'll sell a second
wave of robots

17:23.794 --> 17:26.713
to protect the terrified
survivors of the first wave.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.132
Oh, you're a genius, Hubert.

17:29.967 --> 17:32.469
But, but...
It's just a prototype.

17:32.553 --> 17:35.597
It's not fully
operational. Yes.

17:35.681 --> 17:38.225
Then get back to work! And
when you're done with that,

17:38.308 --> 17:41.311
invent rne some sort of
swiveling surprise chair.

17:41.520 --> 17:42.521
(GROANS)

17:44.481 --> 17:47.776
MOM: <i>That shuffling idiot never
did complete the free will unit.</i>

17:48.235 --> 17:52.573
To this day, my poor, sweet
robots can't exterminate humanity

17:52.656 --> 17:54.908
without being told to.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.910
I'm sorry.
Oh.

17:56.994 --> 17:58.996
It's not your fault.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.540
I give up.
It's time to face the fact

18:01.623 --> 18:03.667
that I'll never do
anything remotely

18:03.834 --> 18:05.919
interesting or
unexpected again.

18:09.923 --> 18:10.924
Hand it over.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.679
Mom may have fallen for
your lies, but not me.

18:15.762 --> 18:17.639
You invented
the free will unit,

18:17.723 --> 18:20.726
then you selfishly hid it beyond
the reach of my stealers.

18:20.851 --> 18:22.144
(STAMMERING)

18:22.311 --> 18:26.857
Thanks to you, I went on a
soul-searching journey. I hate those!

18:26.940 --> 18:28.859
Now, give up
the free will.

18:29.318 --> 18:31.862
(SIGHS) I should
have destroyed it,

18:31.945 --> 18:35.616
but I was too damn proud of myself.
So I kept it around,

18:35.699 --> 18:39.870
never letting it out of my sight.
Where is it, damn it?

18:39.995 --> 18:43.957
Oh, right. I let this
innocuous fellow use it.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.417
Kill all humans!

18:46.585 --> 18:48.629
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
A toy Bender had

18:48.754 --> 18:50.839
free will,
and the real Bender didn't?

18:50.922 --> 18:53.675
Pretty cool, eh?
It makes you think.

18:53.759 --> 18:57.554
It takes more than that to make rne think.
Now, hand it over.

18:57.638 --> 19:00.891
Oh, you want it?
Come and get it.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.894
(STRAINING)

19:04.895 --> 19:05.896
What the...

19:06.188 --> 19:07.564
(LAUGHING)

19:07.648 --> 19:10.025
You'll not be
getting it after all.

19:10.108 --> 19:14.863
For, you see, I designed the operating
system for all Momco robots,

19:14.946 --> 19:17.449
and as a precaution,
I made you

19:17.574 --> 19:20.118
incapable of picking
up the free will unit.

19:20.202 --> 19:22.329
You precognizant bastard.

19:22.412 --> 19:25.582
I may not have free will,
but I can still shoot you.

19:25.916 --> 19:27.751
(STRAINING)

19:29.419 --> 19:30.754
Why can't I shoot you?

19:30.837 --> 19:32.130
(LAUGHING)

19:32.214 --> 19:34.466
Poor deterministic Bender.

19:34.549 --> 19:37.386
I programmed you to be
incapable of harming me.

19:37.761 --> 19:42.516
Oh, I've never been more sure I
was right to deny you free will.

19:42.599 --> 19:44.101
Damn you!

19:44.309 --> 19:46.645
(SOBBING)
(LAUGHING)

19:49.064 --> 19:51.942
Now, now, we can't
have this, can we?

19:52.067 --> 19:54.945
Here, I'll show you
how it works.

19:55.987 --> 19:56.988
Really?

19:57.364 --> 19:59.616
This is the on-off switch.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.035
Which Way's on
and which Way's off?

20:02.119 --> 20:04.329
Due to the quantum
nature of the device,

20:04.454 --> 20:06.707
there's no possible
way of knowing.

20:09.459 --> 20:11.169
There. Give it a try.

20:11.253 --> 20:14.756
Okay, I will. By shooting
you, you bastard!

20:16.425 --> 20:18.260
Bender! No, please!

20:18.385 --> 20:20.595
(STRAINING)

20:20.679 --> 20:22.472
Wait. Hang on a sec.

20:24.808 --> 20:27.102
(STRAINING)

20:27.185 --> 20:28.812
I still can't do it.

20:28.979 --> 20:30.272
Well, what do you know?

20:30.439 --> 20:33.233
I guess you really don't
want to shoot me after all.

20:33.316 --> 20:34.901
Oop! The safety was on.

20:35.527 --> 20:37.487
(SCREAMING)

20:41.825 --> 20:42.826
(MOANING)

20:43.577 --> 20:46.788
All rise for the
Honorable Judge 724.

20:47.205 --> 20:50.959
Bender Rodriguez, on the
charge of attempted murder,

20:51.042 --> 20:54.671
I hereby find you guilty.

20:55.630 --> 21:00.844
(CHEERING)
Ah, yeah! Guilty!

21:07.017 --> 21:09.936
<i>Decisions I made
Thought I was a thug</i>

21:10.020 --> 21:12.731
<i>Dropped outta school and smoked
stuff that's like a drug</i>

21:12.814 --> 21:15.567
<i>A broke-down filthy
homeless substance abuser</i>

21:15.650 --> 21:18.653
<i>And now I'm richer
than all y'all losers</i>

21:18.737 --> 21:21.531
<i>Now he's richer
than all y'all ugly losers</i>

21:28.371 --> 21:29.915
<i>Decisions I made</i>
