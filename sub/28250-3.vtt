WEBVTT

00:00.487 --> 00:03.102
Eight years ago, I was lead prosecutor

00:03.127 --> 00:05.395
on a murder trial
that divided the country.

00:05.430 --> 00:07.864
When the jury found
movie star Sevvy Johnson

00:07.899 --> 00:10.153
not guilty of double homicide,

00:10.777 --> 00:11.943
I was devastated.

00:11.968 --> 00:13.401
You did everything you could, Maya.

00:13.435 --> 00:14.498
I walked out of the courtroom

00:14.522 --> 00:17.104
and left that life
and everyone in it behind.

00:17.139 --> 00:18.669
But then the unthinkable happened.

00:18.704 --> 00:19.809
He killed again.

00:19.844 --> 00:21.107
You have to come back, Maya.

00:21.142 --> 00:23.008
This time, we're gonna get him.

00:23.043 --> 00:24.410
A detective came by my place.

00:24.444 --> 00:25.944
They always want to talk to the ex.

00:25.979 --> 00:27.804
- How much?
- $100,000.

00:27.838 --> 00:29.180
I call, you jump,

00:29.214 --> 00:31.449
or my next call will be to the D.A.,

00:31.483 --> 00:33.183
and you can kiss your job goodbye.

00:33.217 --> 00:34.184
I'm gonna hold a press conference,

00:34.218 --> 00:36.286
get it out there
that Sevvy was planning to flee.

00:36.320 --> 00:38.421
I try my case in court, not the press.

00:38.455 --> 00:39.699
I understand all of that, but...

00:39.723 --> 00:41.590
- Maya's the lead on this.
- Great.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.410
This case is about domestic violence.

00:43.445 --> 00:46.175
Sevvy Johnson killed Jessica Meyer.

00:46.176 --> 00:47.752
It's time to let Jessica speak.

00:47.786 --> 00:49.120
He did it again.

00:49.154 --> 00:51.310
He gave me this. He gave me this.

00:51.344 --> 00:52.524
Dad, are you seeing this?!

00:52.558 --> 00:53.597
Baby!

00:53.632 --> 00:55.458
My God, it's been so long.

00:55.493 --> 00:56.826
My God.

00:56.861 --> 00:58.093
Did you do it?!

00:58.128 --> 00:59.862
Did you kill Jessica?!

01:01.498 --> 01:02.807
Sevvy, what are you doing?!
You're hurting me.

01:02.831 --> 01:03.840
Answer the question.

01:03.874 --> 01:05.110
This is insane. I don't understand...

01:05.134 --> 01:06.301
Did you kill her?!

01:06.335 --> 01:08.235
No! How could you think that about me?

01:08.269 --> 01:09.310
Because you were jealous,

01:09.344 --> 01:11.305
always asking me
was she good enough for me,

01:11.339 --> 01:13.072
was she pretty enough.
You wanted her gone.

01:13.106 --> 01:14.607
Of course I wanted her gone!

01:14.641 --> 01:16.786
Because every night you were here
with me, you'd go home to her.

01:16.810 --> 01:18.180
But that doesn't mean I killed her.

01:18.204 --> 01:21.179
I-I-I can prove it.
Please, let me call Mandy.

01:21.213 --> 01:22.746
Let me call her, okay?

01:27.052 --> 01:28.418
Don't be funny.

01:35.892 --> 01:37.109
- Hey, girl. What's up?
- Hey.

01:37.143 --> 01:39.527
I was just telling a friend
about our Palm Springs trip,

01:39.561 --> 01:42.462
and I can't remember
which weekend we went out there.

01:42.496 --> 01:44.864
Seriously? We were just there
last weekend.

01:44.899 --> 01:46.366
My ass is still sunburned.

01:46.400 --> 01:48.310
Right, but what day did we come back?

01:48.344 --> 01:49.468
Tuesday.

01:49.502 --> 01:51.470
How wasted were you?

01:54.974 --> 01:57.008
What the hell, Sevvy?!

01:57.042 --> 01:59.009
I-I'm so sorry, babe. I'm sorry.

01:59.043 --> 02:00.455
You almost broke my arm!

02:00.489 --> 02:01.522
I'll make it up to you, I swear.

02:01.546 --> 02:02.956
- I-I didn't mean to hurt...
- Do not.

02:02.980 --> 02:04.847
What is wrong with you?

02:04.881 --> 02:06.615
Look, I-I'm just really
messed up right now.

02:06.650 --> 02:08.316
I'm just trying to figure all this out.

02:08.351 --> 02:11.519
Please don't. Don't make
me feel bad for you.

02:11.554 --> 02:13.620
You're right.

02:13.655 --> 02:14.855
There's no excuse.

02:16.558 --> 02:18.624
Look, babe, all I know is being with you

02:18.659 --> 02:19.826
makes me feel better.

02:19.860 --> 02:21.555
And you do realize

02:22.427 --> 02:24.628
that's why I fell for you, right?

02:24.653 --> 02:26.820
'Cause you see me.

02:26.845 --> 02:28.227
The real me.

02:30.869 --> 02:33.036
Is there a chance
that you can forgive me?

02:34.271 --> 02:35.504
Please.

02:38.241 --> 02:40.175
Yes, baby.

02:48.716 --> 02:51.051
Hey, there, stranger. You're up late.

02:51.085 --> 02:54.086
I just finished feeding the horses.

02:54.121 --> 02:56.389
Takes a little longer
when you're by yourself.

02:56.423 --> 02:59.357
I so wish I was there right now.

02:59.392 --> 03:01.059
I'm tired of drinking alone.

03:01.093 --> 03:03.258
I'm tired of going to bed alone.

03:03.259 --> 03:04.860
Me too.

03:04.894 --> 03:07.761
I'm definitely missing that right now.

03:07.796 --> 03:09.663
Hey, I saw your press conference tonight.

03:09.698 --> 03:11.565
You got that son of a bitch
on the ropes?

03:11.600 --> 03:13.410
Maybe you'll win this thing
quicker than you thought.

03:13.434 --> 03:15.068
I like the way you think.

03:18.605 --> 03:20.072
I have to get back to work.

03:20.106 --> 03:22.506
I'm sorry. But I-I love you.

03:22.541 --> 03:24.476
Love you back.

03:24.510 --> 03:25.610
Bye.

03:38.487 --> 03:40.455
Hello?

04:41.213 --> 04:49.212
Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com.

04:50.286 --> 04:51.787
How do you defend Sevvy Johnson

04:51.812 --> 04:54.460
now that Maya Travis has exposed
his domestic abuse?

04:54.485 --> 04:57.005
Alleged abuse.
Let's not jump the gun, Laura.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.371
The video hasn't been verified yet.

04:58.372 --> 05:00.607
Those bruises on Jessica
are hard to deny.

05:00.641 --> 05:02.741
Like I said,
I haven't verified the video.

05:02.776 --> 05:05.677
The only thing that was made
clear in that press conference

05:05.712 --> 05:08.579
is Maya Travis' obsession
with smearing my client,

05:08.614 --> 05:09.758
who hasn't even been charged
with a crime.

05:09.782 --> 05:11.892
But Maya Travis didn't only
go after Sevvy last night.

05:11.916 --> 05:12.983
She went after you.

05:13.017 --> 05:16.018
Are you responsible
for the death of Ben Mitchell?

05:17.387 --> 05:18.654
Mr. Wolf?

05:19.790 --> 05:22.157
Ben Mitchell was a troubled man.

05:22.758 --> 05:25.077
His suicide is a tragedy.

05:25.894 --> 05:28.762
And I think it a shame
that Ms. Travis is using it

05:28.797 --> 05:30.581
as a publicity stunt.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.366
But the sad truth, Laura,

05:33.400 --> 05:38.036
is that some people
will do anything to win.

05:41.306 --> 05:42.873
Think anybody will buy that crap?

05:42.908 --> 05:45.109
What I need to buy is time.

05:45.143 --> 05:46.653
My reasonable doubt jumped out a window,

05:46.677 --> 05:48.711
and thanks to Maya Travis,
Jessica's ghost

05:48.746 --> 05:50.712
just publicly eviscerated my client.

05:50.747 --> 05:52.414
Well, when it rains, it pours.

05:52.449 --> 05:54.616
Guess where Sevvy was last night.

05:54.651 --> 05:57.852
You, my friend,
have a client-control problem.

06:03.875 --> 06:04.958
Where were you?

06:04.992 --> 06:06.625
Stuck on a night shoot.

06:06.660 --> 06:09.295
Some Japanese cola ad.

06:09.329 --> 06:10.862
Bloody mess.

06:11.670 --> 06:14.305
You know what the scariest thing
about you is?

06:14.330 --> 06:15.732
You're a brilliant liar.

06:15.767 --> 06:17.067
Hey.

06:17.102 --> 06:18.512
You make everybody want to believe you.

06:18.536 --> 06:19.814
Hey, where's all this coming from?

06:19.838 --> 06:21.404
What's happened?

06:21.438 --> 06:22.538
Have you not seen the news?

06:22.573 --> 06:25.141
You know I don't watch the news.
It messes with my head.

06:25.175 --> 06:27.008
It's time to let Jessica speak.

06:27.043 --> 06:28.643
He gave me this when I said

06:28.678 --> 06:31.846
I wasn't ready to leave
Ray's dinner party last night.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.181
He gave me this when we got home.

06:34.216 --> 06:35.915
I had laughed too hard when Gabe made fun

06:35.950 --> 06:37.650
of Sevvy's crappy golf swing.

06:37.685 --> 06:39.652
I am not gonna wait around
for him to change

06:39.687 --> 06:41.687
and end up like her.

06:41.721 --> 06:43.589
I'm taking these videos to the police.

06:43.623 --> 06:45.324
My God.

06:45.357 --> 06:48.122
Now the whole world knows
that you abused her. So do I.

06:48.157 --> 06:50.760
No, no, you know that's not the real me.

06:50.795 --> 06:52.295
That looks pretty real!

06:52.330 --> 06:54.631
- Just calm down.
- I was trying to protect you!

06:54.665 --> 06:56.599
I was trying to show you
that I was a good son.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.766
You are a good son.

06:57.801 --> 07:00.368
You always tell me that, but
only when you need something!

07:00.402 --> 07:02.670
That's why you trusted me
with that bag, right?

07:02.705 --> 07:05.339
'Cause you knew that I would run
the extra mile for you,

07:05.373 --> 07:06.773
that would earn Daddy's love.

07:06.808 --> 07:07.952
- I'm out of here.
- No, don't go.

07:07.976 --> 07:09.276
I can't lose you, too.

07:09.310 --> 07:10.877
Look. I loved Jessica.

07:10.911 --> 07:12.188
No matter what anybody says about me,

07:12.212 --> 07:13.613
I didn't kill her.

07:13.647 --> 07:14.847
You've got to believe me.

07:14.882 --> 07:16.314
No, I don't. No, I don't.

07:16.349 --> 07:17.682
Hey, Gabe. Gabe?

07:17.717 --> 07:18.817
Gabe!

07:25.422 --> 07:27.624
Hey. Congratulations, you're a meme.

07:27.658 --> 07:28.558
What?

07:28.592 --> 07:30.826
Your press conference got 3 million views

07:30.860 --> 07:33.795
and #MayaOnFaya is trending on Twitter.

07:33.830 --> 07:36.697
So I make a statement about
domestic violence and suicide,

07:36.732 --> 07:38.166
and somehow it's all about me?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.500
Welcome back to the spotlight.

07:40.535 --> 07:41.912
At least this time
it's not about your love life.

07:41.936 --> 07:42.869
I mean, what was the rumor before?

07:42.904 --> 07:45.337
That you and Matthew had
a secret love child?

07:45.372 --> 07:47.840
Yeah, a ton of fun to be back.

07:47.874 --> 07:50.909
Speaking of which,
I got a present last night

07:50.943 --> 07:52.544
from my biggest fan.

07:52.578 --> 07:53.845
Your stalker?

07:53.879 --> 07:56.013
He's back? Same M.O.?

07:56.047 --> 07:58.815
Maya, I'm calling somebody.
I'm putting a detective on you.

07:58.850 --> 08:01.150
There is nothing illegal
about giving somebody jewelry.

08:01.185 --> 08:02.318
I'm fine.

08:02.352 --> 08:04.543
If you were fine, you wouldn't
be telling me about it.

08:04.578 --> 08:06.021
This guy never escalated,

08:06.055 --> 08:07.722
he never crossed a legal line.

08:07.757 --> 08:09.424
I'm not really in danger.

08:09.458 --> 08:11.592
Then why did I buy you a gun
eight years ago?

08:11.626 --> 08:15.428
Because it was my birthday
and you worry too much.

08:15.462 --> 08:16.896
Maya, you were scared.

08:17.885 --> 08:19.085
Please, let's just drop this.

08:19.110 --> 08:21.110
I need to focus on the case.

08:22.802 --> 08:24.369
Maya, you got five minutes?

08:24.404 --> 08:26.571
See? Duty calls.

08:28.106 --> 08:29.574
Four days in and you're already

08:29.608 --> 08:31.074
hitting home runs.

08:31.108 --> 08:32.601
How does it feel?

08:33.110 --> 08:35.443
Aside from being back in the spotlight,

08:35.477 --> 08:37.346
it feels pretty damn good.

08:37.380 --> 08:38.773
I bet.

08:39.316 --> 08:40.941
But, um...

08:41.317 --> 08:44.385
why don't you walk me through
your thought process last night

08:44.420 --> 08:46.954
when you set up this big show

08:46.988 --> 08:49.523
and decided not to get my approval?

08:49.556 --> 08:50.992
Well, you were the one
who kept talking about

08:51.016 --> 08:53.926
controlling the narrative,
so I controlled it.

08:53.961 --> 08:57.696
I'm sorry, but eight years ago,
we were a team.

08:57.730 --> 08:59.030
But I'm chief deputy now.

08:59.065 --> 09:01.532
You can't blindside me like that.

09:01.566 --> 09:04.901
You have to get my permission
before you make the big moves,

09:04.935 --> 09:07.437
especially when it comes to the media.

09:09.153 --> 09:10.785
Message received.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.944
We're not a team, you handle the media.

09:12.969 --> 09:14.468
Got it.

09:15.944 --> 09:18.596
So, where are we?

09:18.947 --> 09:20.714
The press conference was a solid jab,

09:20.748 --> 09:22.115
but it wasn't a knockout.

09:22.149 --> 09:23.894
We still don't have enough
to arrest Johnson,

09:23.918 --> 09:26.218
and the family's closed ranks.

09:26.253 --> 09:28.954
But Jessica showed everyone
who Sevvy really is,

09:28.989 --> 09:31.456
so we're gonna widen the net.

09:31.490 --> 09:34.458
Maybe we can get somebody
in his outer circle to talk.

09:36.995 --> 09:38.305
Well, did you forget how this works?

09:38.329 --> 09:39.606
You tell me the punches are coming

09:39.630 --> 09:41.464
before they hit me in the nose.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.833
Maya didn't loop me in
on the press conference.

09:43.867 --> 09:46.468
I can't warn you about something
I don't know about.

09:46.502 --> 09:48.270
No, I don't take excuses, sweetheart.

09:48.304 --> 09:49.737
What am I supposed to do?

09:49.771 --> 09:52.473
Maya's a control freak.
She's shutting me out.

09:52.507 --> 09:53.741
Pick a lock.

09:53.775 --> 09:56.126
Crawl through the window. Figure it out.

09:58.946 --> 10:01.580
Okay, take a big deep breath, relax.

10:01.614 --> 10:05.349
My Zen vitamin infusion
is a great stress reliever.

10:05.384 --> 10:06.984
I bloody well hope so, Doc.

10:07.019 --> 10:08.930
Glad to see you're getting
the best medical treatment

10:08.954 --> 10:10.345
money can buy.

10:11.022 --> 10:12.155
Hello, Ezra.

10:12.189 --> 10:14.473
Carys. Nice to see you again.

10:15.025 --> 10:16.158
Could you give us a minute?

10:18.461 --> 10:20.028
I'll give you 10.

10:20.062 --> 10:21.663
Thank you.

10:24.032 --> 10:25.132
Where the hell you been?

10:25.166 --> 10:26.310
I've been calling you all morning.

10:26.334 --> 10:27.868
Sorry, I can't answer the phone

10:27.902 --> 10:28.802
when I'm on national TV

10:28.836 --> 10:31.137
trying to explain away
Jessica's black eye.

10:31.171 --> 10:32.772
You think you pay me a lot?

10:32.806 --> 10:34.005
You don't pay me enough.

10:34.040 --> 10:35.874
I don't need a guilt trip from my lawyer.

10:35.908 --> 10:37.876
I pay you to defend me.

10:37.910 --> 10:39.654
And from what I saw
in the Laura Wu interview,

10:39.678 --> 10:41.111
you're doing a piss-poor job at it.

10:41.146 --> 10:43.013
Let me tell you, you're making it hard.

10:43.048 --> 10:45.882
I just heard you had
a booty call last night.

10:45.916 --> 10:47.784
You're supposed to be
the grieving boyfriend.

10:47.818 --> 10:49.785
I am grieving.

10:49.819 --> 10:51.787
It's not what you think.
I needed to talk to her.

10:51.821 --> 10:53.854
Then you did a lot of talking, did you?

10:54.823 --> 10:57.124
This is not eight years ago, Sevvy.

10:57.159 --> 10:58.858
I worked a miracle in that first trial

10:58.893 --> 11:00.960
because the whole world loved
Sevvy Johnson.

11:00.995 --> 11:02.228
They still love me.

11:02.263 --> 11:04.396
Yeah, you're huge
in Japan and Bulgaria.

11:04.431 --> 11:05.664
Not our jury pool.

11:05.699 --> 11:07.966
And Maya 2.0 just stuck a knife

11:08.001 --> 11:09.834
in what little reputation you have left.

11:09.868 --> 11:12.203
Man, I hate that slag.

11:12.237 --> 11:16.540
Then maybe you should stop
doing things that help her.

11:16.574 --> 11:17.874
Hey, what you doing?

11:17.909 --> 11:20.209
It's time for a vow of celibacy.

11:20.243 --> 11:22.345
Here is a new phone.

11:22.379 --> 11:24.379
One number on it... mine.

11:24.413 --> 11:25.747
Now all I have to worry about is

11:25.781 --> 11:27.248
whatever the hell is in your arm.

11:27.283 --> 11:28.982
The press are at your gate.

11:29.017 --> 11:30.884
They'd love to get a load
of Dr. Carys Daly

11:30.919 --> 11:32.353
and her magic IV.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.320
Just relax, all right?

11:34.355 --> 11:35.732
I've been hiding
from the press for years.

11:35.756 --> 11:36.689
I know what I'm doing.

11:36.724 --> 11:38.490
The house has a private entrance
down below.

11:38.524 --> 11:40.058
Nobody saw her come in.

11:40.093 --> 11:41.460
It's handled.

11:42.528 --> 11:44.195
What? There's a...

11:44.229 --> 11:47.282
a way in and out of here
that nobody knows about?

11:47.316 --> 11:48.381
Yeah.

11:48.415 --> 11:49.733
What about security cameras?

11:49.767 --> 11:52.001
It's in a blind spot.

11:52.036 --> 11:53.511
We're screwed.

11:54.137 --> 11:56.248
No, I mean, we're so far past
screwed that the light from screwed

11:56.272 --> 11:57.695
will take a thousand years to reach us.

11:57.719 --> 11:58.758
What're you talking about?

11:58.792 --> 12:00.608
The only thing we had going for us

12:00.642 --> 12:03.276
was that your security camera
didn't show you

12:03.311 --> 12:05.345
leaving the house
the morning of the murder.

12:07.315 --> 12:09.014
You're the miracle worker.

12:11.051 --> 12:12.585
Figure it out.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.503
You know what?

12:26.797 --> 12:29.206
I'm almost glad that you replaced me.

12:29.999 --> 12:32.367
Is that a compliment or an insult?

12:33.502 --> 12:36.137
Grudging admiration.

12:36.171 --> 12:38.037
That press conference took balls.

12:38.072 --> 12:40.940
So yesterday I was wrong for the job,

12:40.975 --> 12:43.542
and today you want to be friends?

12:43.576 --> 12:45.469
That sounds like an ask.

12:46.146 --> 12:48.045
More like a white flag.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.140
We got off on the wrong foot.

12:50.749 --> 12:52.898
But you got a good team here,

12:52.932 --> 12:54.785
so use your team.

12:54.819 --> 12:56.521
I'll think about it.

12:57.688 --> 12:59.288
Good news.

12:59.322 --> 13:01.424
Operation Widen The Net just paid off.

13:01.458 --> 13:02.758
You found someone.

13:02.793 --> 13:04.592
Sevvy's sidepiece.

13:04.627 --> 13:06.394
Once a cheater, always a cheater, right?

13:06.429 --> 13:07.928
I went by some of his favorite hotels

13:07.962 --> 13:09.930
to see what girl
he's been bringing around.

13:09.964 --> 13:11.231
And they told you?

13:11.266 --> 13:13.166
Whatever happened to discretion?

13:13.200 --> 13:16.335
Yesterday, you reminded everyone
who Sevvy Johnson really is...

13:16.370 --> 13:18.603
and they became a lot less discreet.

13:18.638 --> 13:20.972
The kitchen manager at the Hotel Bel-Air

13:21.007 --> 13:22.973
pulled some room-service receipts

13:23.008 --> 13:25.109
from the last time
that Johnson stayed there.

13:25.143 --> 13:27.420
His girl signed for a bottle of Dom.

13:28.145 --> 13:31.147
So, you ready to meet the other woman?

13:43.357 --> 13:44.641
You're Dia, right?

13:46.000 --> 13:47.194
I know who you are.

13:47.228 --> 13:48.994
Then you know why I'm here.

13:49.029 --> 13:52.164
And you got it all wrong.
Sevvy didn't kill Jessica.

13:52.199 --> 13:53.698
He came to me last night.

13:53.732 --> 13:55.166
He accused me of doing it.

13:55.201 --> 13:56.267
He's a smart guy.

13:56.302 --> 13:59.470
He knew we'd find you,
and he knew you'd tell us that.

13:59.504 --> 14:01.672
Nothing could make me help you.

14:01.706 --> 14:03.372
Why? 'Cause Sevvy loves you?

14:03.407 --> 14:06.509
I found four girls just like you
before the last trial.

14:06.543 --> 14:08.543
Sevvy's a movie star.
He's got a lot of girls.

14:08.578 --> 14:10.946
But you're the special one, right?

14:10.980 --> 14:13.447
Let me guess. Your first date
was at the Beverly Hilton,

14:13.482 --> 14:14.849
fifth-floor suite?

14:14.883 --> 14:17.218
First weekend away was
the Biltmore Santa Barbara.

14:17.252 --> 14:18.985
He gave you a rose gold bracelet,

14:19.019 --> 14:22.021
said he was falling for you
because you see the real him.

14:22.056 --> 14:23.622
Am I close?

14:23.656 --> 14:24.800
Screw you.

14:24.834 --> 14:25.891
You're not special, Dia.

14:25.925 --> 14:27.192
Don't go to jail for this guy.

14:27.227 --> 14:29.527
Jail? What the hell
are you talking about?

14:29.561 --> 14:32.230
Remember that DUI
you failed to appear for?

14:32.264 --> 14:33.897
Dia Briseño, you are under arrest.

14:33.931 --> 14:35.031
What the hell?

14:35.066 --> 14:36.967
Sevvy told me you were a bitch.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.901
From him, I'll take that as a compliment.

14:38.935 --> 14:40.135
Let's go.

14:44.394 --> 14:46.620
"We condemn domestic violence
in all its forms."

14:46.654 --> 14:50.195
Our agency is ending its
relationship with Sevvy Johnson,

14:50.229 --> 14:51.762
"effective immediately."

14:51.797 --> 14:52.950
I mean, can you believe that?

14:52.974 --> 14:54.308
After all the bloody money I made them,

14:54.332 --> 14:55.599
they do me like this?

14:55.633 --> 14:56.647
On bloody Twitter?

14:56.681 --> 14:57.944
Well, they didn't have
much choice, did they?

14:57.968 --> 14:59.802
I'm losing everything...

14:59.836 --> 15:01.470
me career, me fans,

15:01.505 --> 15:03.705
everything I've worked
so bloody hard to build.

15:03.739 --> 15:06.141
I know how hard you worked.
I built it with you.

15:06.175 --> 15:08.642
My own kids won't even bloody talk to me.

15:08.676 --> 15:10.611
Look, I don't deserve this.

15:10.645 --> 15:12.745
You created this.

15:12.779 --> 15:15.281
If you're looking for sympathy from me,

15:15.315 --> 15:16.415
look elsewhere.

15:16.450 --> 15:18.416
No. No, not you, too.

15:18.451 --> 15:19.551
Look.

15:19.585 --> 15:20.927
I need you, Jules.

15:22.787 --> 15:23.821
It's Gabe.

15:23.855 --> 15:26.257
He's packed his stuff and left.

15:26.291 --> 15:28.591
Look. I-I'm just worried
h-he's gonna say something

15:28.626 --> 15:30.059
h-he might regret.

15:30.094 --> 15:32.327
J-Just talk to him, okay?

15:32.362 --> 15:35.097
I'm not Gabe's mother.
Why would he listen to me?

15:35.131 --> 15:37.398
Just talk to him.

15:37.866 --> 15:39.934
What is it you're not telling me?

15:39.968 --> 15:41.360
Nothing.

15:42.036 --> 15:43.570
You want to keep all this

15:43.604 --> 15:46.197
and everything we worked
so bloody hard to build?

15:47.107 --> 15:48.641
Then help me.

15:51.877 --> 15:54.245
Sevvy didn't do it.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.414
You saw what Sevvy did to Jessica.

15:57.448 --> 15:58.749
Did he ever hit you, Dia?

15:58.783 --> 15:59.816
No.

15:59.851 --> 16:01.318
Sevvy would never do that to me.

16:01.352 --> 16:04.120
Not at the start, but everything
is a pattern with him.

16:04.154 --> 16:06.522
First it's a bracelet,
then it's a black eye.

16:06.557 --> 16:07.856
Maya, take it easy on her.

16:07.890 --> 16:09.824
She needs to know the truth.

16:09.859 --> 16:11.426
If Sevvy hasn't hit you yet,

16:11.460 --> 16:13.827
it's only because you haven't
been around long enough.

16:13.862 --> 16:15.262
Maybe you're right.

16:16.730 --> 16:17.943
But I'd rather rot in jail

16:17.978 --> 16:19.832
than to help
a white bread bitch like you.

16:19.867 --> 16:21.833
Have fun in lockup.

16:25.371 --> 16:27.772
White bread bitch?

16:27.806 --> 16:30.875
Perfect way to describe Maya Travis.

16:30.909 --> 16:33.176
She's like a raptor in heels.

16:33.211 --> 16:34.778
Is she going for it?

16:34.812 --> 16:36.446
Let's hope Loni can sell her part.

16:36.479 --> 16:38.391
Glad I'm not the only one
who thinks she's a psycho.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.882
We're not all like Maya.

16:39.916 --> 16:41.849
She doesn't see the human shrapnel

16:41.884 --> 16:43.151
she leaves in her wake.

16:44.553 --> 16:46.387
Yeah, she's selling it.

16:46.421 --> 16:48.088
I don't want you to be shrapnel, Dia.

16:49.390 --> 16:51.358
Does he really do that with everyone?

16:51.391 --> 16:52.658
The Biltmore and everything?

16:52.693 --> 16:53.893
Every time.

16:53.927 --> 16:56.528
God, I feel like an idiot.

16:56.562 --> 16:58.196
You're not.

16:58.231 --> 17:01.506
Believe me, I have had bad men
in my life, too,

17:02.167 --> 17:04.501
men who catch you
in a moment of weakness,

17:04.536 --> 17:07.837
then take you for all you're worth.

17:09.272 --> 17:11.906
Once you give up your power,

17:11.941 --> 17:13.892
you become nothing to them.

17:14.611 --> 17:15.676
They own you.

17:17.546 --> 17:19.213
Don't you wish there was some way

17:19.248 --> 17:23.083
you could just take that power back?

17:27.854 --> 17:30.089
Thanks so much for coming
on such short notice.

17:30.123 --> 17:31.833
- Ezra will be right out.
- Don't worry about me.

17:31.857 --> 17:34.459
I've spent plenty of time
waiting for Ezra Wolf.

17:35.461 --> 17:36.827
Thank you, Charlie.

17:36.861 --> 17:38.528
I can escort the good doctor from here.

17:39.697 --> 17:43.099
I have to admit, I was surprised
seeing you this morning.

17:43.133 --> 17:45.011
I didn't realize you were still
treating Sevvy Johnson.

17:45.035 --> 17:47.836
I divorced you, not my patients.

17:47.870 --> 17:49.771
Yes, you certainly did.

17:49.805 --> 17:51.739
But not for lack of consortium.

17:51.773 --> 17:53.674
What do you want, Ezra?

17:53.708 --> 17:55.509
I want to talk about Sevvy.

17:55.543 --> 17:57.277
You must be as devastated as I am

17:57.311 --> 17:59.445
by what's happening to him.

17:59.480 --> 18:00.880
I know he's under a lot of stress,

18:00.913 --> 18:02.258
and I'm treating him as best I can.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.582
I'm sure.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.559
But there's a way you can help

18:07.953 --> 18:12.255
beyond just the, um, "vitamin infusions."

18:12.290 --> 18:13.857
What are you getting at?

18:13.891 --> 18:16.091
Sevvy's house has a private entrance,

18:16.126 --> 18:18.961
a secret entrance that you know well.

18:18.995 --> 18:20.296
Yes.

18:20.330 --> 18:21.796
Have you used it a lot?

18:21.830 --> 18:22.930
I use it when I visit.

18:22.965 --> 18:24.399
Which must be quite often.

18:24.433 --> 18:27.134
Maybe more often
than you can even remember.

18:27.168 --> 18:28.201
Get to the point.

18:28.236 --> 18:31.771
Maybe you used it.
The morning of Jessica's murder.

18:33.407 --> 18:34.507
Wow.

18:35.908 --> 18:38.376
You must really be desperate.

18:38.411 --> 18:40.486
I'm just trying to help my client,

18:40.520 --> 18:41.745
same as you.

18:41.780 --> 18:43.491
Why are you representing
Sevvy Johnson again?

18:43.515 --> 18:45.815
You won that last trial
by the skin of your teeth.

18:45.849 --> 18:47.299
But I won.

18:48.185 --> 18:49.752
I always win.

18:53.323 --> 18:55.457
You'll have to win this one without me.

19:07.334 --> 19:08.734
Maya.

19:08.768 --> 19:09.768
It's been a long time.

19:09.803 --> 19:11.736
Hi, Effy. It's nice to see you.

19:11.770 --> 19:13.571
Just need a signature from Matt.

19:13.605 --> 19:14.972
Maya, hey. What's up?

19:15.007 --> 19:16.273
Could we talk?

19:21.978 --> 19:23.913
We just flipped Sevvy Johnson's mistress.

19:23.947 --> 19:25.281
Seriously?

19:25.315 --> 19:27.349
He wants to meet her at a hotel tonight,

19:27.383 --> 19:29.333
and she's gonna wear a wire.

19:29.819 --> 19:31.785
I just need your approval.

19:31.820 --> 19:33.821
This is a man who probably
killed three women,

19:33.855 --> 19:35.988
and you want to send
his mistress in with a wire?

19:36.023 --> 19:38.825
We coordinated with the LAPD.
They'll be standing by.

19:38.859 --> 19:40.036
I'm not sure it's worth the risk.

19:40.060 --> 19:41.537
It's not like he's gonna confess to her.

19:41.561 --> 19:43.128
I'm not expecting a confession,

19:43.162 --> 19:45.030
but maybe he'll say something damaging

19:45.064 --> 19:46.831
that can help us make an arrest.

19:46.865 --> 19:48.933
Sometimes you have to take risks.

19:48.967 --> 19:51.868
If this goes bad,
a lot of that blowback is on me.

19:51.902 --> 19:55.437
Is that what this is about,
covering your ass?

19:56.072 --> 19:58.173
The old Matthew
would have loved this idea.

19:58.208 --> 19:59.541
I'm still the old Matthew,

19:59.576 --> 20:01.709
just a little older and a little wiser.

20:01.744 --> 20:02.810
Really?

20:02.845 --> 20:05.879
You haven't stepped foot
in a courtroom in eight years.

20:05.913 --> 20:08.281
I know I ran, but so did you.

20:08.316 --> 20:10.783
You just ran behind your nice, safe desk.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.328
I need to move on this.

20:15.888 --> 20:17.989
You either trust me or you don't.

20:24.696 --> 20:26.596
I've always trusted you, Maya.

20:29.032 --> 20:30.256
Keep her safe.

20:45.982 --> 20:48.650
It's a shame that was his last album.

20:48.685 --> 20:50.818
They say he had the voice
of a drug-addled angel.

20:50.852 --> 20:52.119
What is this?

20:52.154 --> 20:53.721
That is the rising young rock star

20:53.755 --> 20:56.122
you used to treat, remember?

20:56.157 --> 20:58.725
Whatever you think you're doing,
Ezra, I already told you no.

20:58.759 --> 21:00.038
What did he die of, again?

21:00.041 --> 21:03.097
Right... a prescription overdose.

21:03.163 --> 21:04.762
But you were cleared of any wrongdoing

21:04.797 --> 21:06.464
because you were married to me.

21:06.498 --> 21:08.332
I helped you.

21:08.367 --> 21:09.810
It's a shame you can't return the favor.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.091
Don't do this.

21:11.125 --> 21:12.680
I already suffered enough
for what happened.

21:12.704 --> 21:15.471
Don't play holier than thou.

21:15.505 --> 21:18.174
You gave that kid
all the candy he asked for...

21:18.208 --> 21:19.641
in exchange for a down payment

21:19.675 --> 21:21.743
on your tasteless Newport Beach condo.

21:21.777 --> 21:23.378
I made it disappear.

21:24.779 --> 21:26.814
But I can make it reappear if I have to.

21:30.851 --> 21:32.685
I know you, Ezra.

21:32.720 --> 21:33.953
Do you?

21:35.455 --> 21:37.589
I know you're ruthless.

21:38.624 --> 21:39.657
But this is different.

21:42.828 --> 21:45.650
Would you actually destroy me
to get what you want?

21:47.383 --> 21:48.383
Yes.

21:51.201 --> 21:53.368
Let's talk about how you can help me.

21:58.285 --> 21:59.642
This is it, Dia.

21:59.677 --> 22:02.412
Sevvy gets here in an hour,
and in a perfect world,

22:02.446 --> 22:04.580
you get him to confess on the wire.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.415
'Course, we don't expect that.

22:06.449 --> 22:07.783
So what if I can't?

22:07.817 --> 22:09.817
Get him talking about
anything to do with Jessica

22:09.852 --> 22:10.952
or the case.

22:10.986 --> 22:12.998
If he talks enough, he'll
slip up and give us something.

22:13.022 --> 22:14.222
Ask him about the tapes.

22:14.255 --> 22:15.889
Tell him Jessica had no right

22:15.923 --> 22:17.991
to expose their dirty secrets.

22:18.026 --> 22:21.293
If you get stuck, just remember,
Sevvy's a narcissist.

22:21.328 --> 22:23.629
His ego is his Achilles' heel.

22:23.663 --> 22:26.131
Tell him he's like the sun.

22:26.165 --> 22:29.226
Anyone who flies too close
might get burnt.

22:29.934 --> 22:30.968
That's pretty good.

22:31.002 --> 22:32.403
That's just me talking.

22:32.437 --> 22:33.689
You're gonna sell it.

22:35.339 --> 22:36.572
You ready?

22:36.607 --> 22:38.007
Yeah.

22:55.622 --> 22:56.755
Is this too dangerous?

22:56.790 --> 22:58.023
Dia was in danger every time

22:58.058 --> 22:59.624
she opened the door to Sevvy Johnson.

22:59.658 --> 23:02.126
We've taken every precaution,
and she's protected.

23:17.540 --> 23:18.613
Hey, there.

23:18.648 --> 23:19.840
How's it going out there?

23:19.874 --> 23:21.208
It's good. Dia's in the room.

23:21.242 --> 23:22.653
Sevvy should be there in half an hour.

23:22.677 --> 23:24.110
You have enough LAPD standing by?

23:24.144 --> 23:25.478
We're good.

23:25.512 --> 23:27.847
You know, this is below
your pay grade now.

23:29.382 --> 23:30.982
Just being thorough.

23:32.085 --> 23:34.852
Look, Maya, I don't want you
going into this

23:34.886 --> 23:36.220
thinking I don't support you.

23:36.254 --> 23:37.383
I do support you.

23:37.417 --> 23:39.089
I just...

23:40.524 --> 23:41.991
I wish...

23:42.026 --> 23:43.121
I know.

23:43.156 --> 23:45.027
You miss this.

23:48.697 --> 23:51.125
Anyway... good luck.

23:53.502 --> 23:55.102
I know it's tempting.

23:57.205 --> 23:58.371
What's that?

23:58.406 --> 23:59.840
Getting sucked back in,

24:00.607 --> 24:02.593
falling into old habits.

24:03.076 --> 24:05.443
I was just checking in on the case.

24:06.545 --> 24:07.979
Look, I know this is complicated

24:08.013 --> 24:10.147
with you and Maya and your history.

24:10.181 --> 24:13.083
That was a long time ago.

24:13.118 --> 24:16.185
Effy, I'm not tempted by anything.

24:16.220 --> 24:17.320
Good.

24:19.355 --> 24:21.356
Because we make our announcement soon,

24:21.390 --> 24:23.910
and if you're gonna be
the next district attorney,

24:23.944 --> 24:26.093
we can't afford missteps.

24:26.128 --> 24:27.761
I did not give up my journalism career

24:27.796 --> 24:29.929
so we could play runner-up to Wiest.

24:29.964 --> 24:32.365
It's all gonna happen for us.

24:32.399 --> 24:34.266
I promise.

24:34.300 --> 24:37.069
You just have to trust me right now.

24:37.103 --> 24:38.836
I do trust you.

24:40.272 --> 24:42.206
I do.

25:11.164 --> 25:12.731
How do you defend Sevvy Johnson

25:12.765 --> 25:15.399
now that Maya Travis has
exposed his domestic abuse?

25:15.433 --> 25:17.131
Let's not jump the gun, Laura.

25:17.132 --> 25:18.631
That video hasn't been verified yet.

25:18.665 --> 25:20.500
Hey, can we change the channel?

25:20.534 --> 25:23.971
Yo, can we change the channel?!

25:24.043 --> 25:25.579
Hey.

25:25.614 --> 25:27.350
That TV's for everyone, chief.

25:27.384 --> 25:30.322
You don't like it,
go drink in your living room.

25:30.357 --> 25:31.993
Why don't you mind your business?

25:32.027 --> 25:33.463
Hang on a second.

25:33.497 --> 25:35.467
Hey, I know you.

25:35.501 --> 25:38.774
Yeah. Yeah, you're Sevvy Johnson's kid.

25:38.808 --> 25:39.809
The white one.

25:39.844 --> 25:41.012
You got the wrong guy.

25:41.046 --> 25:42.215
No, no, no, no.

25:42.249 --> 25:44.052
You're all over CNN.

25:44.086 --> 25:45.722
You can't hide that face from me.

25:45.757 --> 25:46.925
Piss off, man.

25:48.562 --> 25:50.699
Hey, let me ask you something.

25:54.074 --> 25:56.177
How do you live with yourself, man?

25:56.211 --> 25:58.916
Taking your daddy's money
all these years,

25:58.951 --> 26:01.912
when everybody knows he killed your mom.

26:02.893 --> 26:04.529
Whoa! Hey, hey!

26:08.371 --> 26:10.407
Stop it! That's enough!

26:12.814 --> 26:14.450
Gabe.

26:14.484 --> 26:16.454
My God.

26:16.488 --> 26:17.757
I'm here.

26:23.647 --> 26:25.260
I was gonna have Charlie get you a drink,

26:25.284 --> 26:27.875
but I see you've made yourself at home.

26:27.910 --> 26:29.392
I'm not staying long,

26:29.426 --> 26:31.072
and I didn't drag my ass
all the way downtown

26:31.096 --> 26:32.411
to party with you.

26:32.436 --> 26:33.481
Now, why am I here?

26:33.517 --> 26:35.275
I have a signed affidavit from Carys Daly

26:35.310 --> 26:36.978
saying that she made a house call

26:37.013 --> 26:38.916
the morning of Jessica's murder.

26:43.627 --> 26:44.995
This is crap.

26:45.031 --> 26:46.198
It never happened.

26:46.233 --> 26:47.601
Well, she says it did.

26:47.635 --> 26:48.751
In fact, she says

26:48.785 --> 26:50.808
she gave you a cocktail of Oxy and benzos

26:50.842 --> 26:52.622
and you were out cold
at the time of the murder.

26:52.646 --> 26:55.117
That, my friend, is
what we call an airtight alibi.

26:55.152 --> 26:56.319
Hold on.

26:56.354 --> 26:59.460
You got an affidavit from your ex-wife...

27:00.652 --> 27:02.476
and you think
that's gonna hold up in court?

27:02.500 --> 27:04.070
Well, she was barely a wife.

27:04.104 --> 27:05.373
We were married six months.

27:05.407 --> 27:07.019
I haven't talked to her in half a decade.

27:07.043 --> 27:09.916
But her reputation is sterling.
I can make this stick.

27:09.950 --> 27:11.602
I don't like it.

27:12.088 --> 27:13.990
I don't need it.

27:15.361 --> 27:17.098
I'm innocent.

27:19.269 --> 27:22.074
Being innocent and proving innocence

27:22.109 --> 27:24.079
are two very different things.

27:24.114 --> 27:26.083
Sevvy, we are being killed in the press.

27:26.118 --> 27:27.452
If we don't stop the bleeding,

27:27.488 --> 27:29.557
we are just chumming the water for Maya.

27:29.592 --> 27:31.595
Her next move could land you in jail.

27:31.629 --> 27:36.037
This alibi is our only way out.

27:39.513 --> 27:41.082
What do you want me to do?

27:41.116 --> 27:43.119
I want you to take it.

27:43.154 --> 27:44.623
I want you to memorize it.

27:44.657 --> 27:47.428
From now on, this is your bible.

27:47.463 --> 27:50.502
First thing tomorrow,
we take back the pulpit,

27:50.537 --> 27:52.138
and we preach.

28:27.585 --> 28:30.595
_

28:42.580 --> 28:44.584
Who the hell are you?

28:44.618 --> 28:46.254
I'm Buck Neal.

28:46.289 --> 28:47.392
Who the hell is Buck Neal?

28:47.426 --> 28:48.814
Ezra's fixer. Maya...

28:48.848 --> 28:50.396
I know, we may be blown.

28:50.430 --> 28:52.199
But l-let's just hear what he has to say.

28:52.234 --> 28:53.703
Sevvy sends his regards,

28:53.737 --> 28:55.607
but he won't be joining you tonight.

28:55.641 --> 28:56.773
Or any night.

28:56.807 --> 28:57.912
Okay, I don't understand.

28:57.947 --> 29:02.087
So, Sevvy sent you to break up with me?

29:02.121 --> 29:04.926
I know it's a tough pill
to swallow, honey, but...

29:05.964 --> 29:07.599
maybe this will help...

29:07.634 --> 29:10.272
50 grand for your trouble.

29:11.208 --> 29:12.567
I want to talk to him.

29:14.281 --> 29:15.794
This is the last
you'll be hearing from him.

29:15.818 --> 29:17.086
Now, you trust me.

29:17.120 --> 29:19.191
This is the best version of this.

29:19.225 --> 29:21.295
Now, be a good girl.

29:21.329 --> 29:22.965
Take the money.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.081
You know what? Screw you.

29:25.116 --> 29:26.639
And screw Sevvy!

29:28.044 --> 29:30.347
I'll show you the best version of this.

29:31.918 --> 29:33.559
I don't think our cover's blown,

29:33.594 --> 29:35.893
because that had nothing to do with us.

29:35.927 --> 29:37.674
Yeah, but without Sevvy,
we're still screwed.

29:37.698 --> 29:39.467
Maybe we can still salvage this.

29:39.502 --> 29:41.003
We'll talk to Dia when she gets back.

29:55.369 --> 29:56.537
Hey!

29:56.571 --> 29:58.541
Hey! What the hell are you doing?!

29:58.575 --> 29:59.710
Lady, that's not your car!

30:01.147 --> 30:02.917
Holy crap, she just stole a car!

30:02.951 --> 30:04.019
Where's she going?

30:04.053 --> 30:06.724
She's pissed. She just got dumped.

30:06.760 --> 30:08.305
She's going to Sevvy's. Follow that car.

30:08.329 --> 30:09.598
Go.

30:14.169 --> 30:16.378
I was gonna save your ass.

30:16.413 --> 30:17.615
You son of a bitch.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.291
What did she say? She was gonna save him?

30:19.320 --> 30:20.621
She was gonna tip him off.

30:20.655 --> 30:22.091
Girl, no.

30:23.261 --> 30:24.429
What the hell?

30:24.464 --> 30:26.968
She's out of range. We've lost audio.

30:27.002 --> 30:28.505
She's gone.

30:33.483 --> 30:35.353
Get the shot. Got it?

30:35.387 --> 30:37.157
One question!

30:37.191 --> 30:40.531
Open the gate, you son of a bitch!

30:44.573 --> 30:46.977
Sevvy Johnson!

30:47.012 --> 30:48.855
Open this gate!

30:50.703 --> 30:52.398
Just calm down, damn you.

30:52.423 --> 30:53.660
What the bloody hell were you thinking?!

30:53.684 --> 30:55.831
- There's paparazzi out there!
- How could you do that to me?!

30:55.855 --> 30:57.495
Send that creep to the hotel?

30:57.520 --> 30:58.754
What are you talking about?!

30:58.789 --> 31:00.558
Then you try to pay me off
like some whore?

31:00.592 --> 31:01.701
- What are you...
- Screw you!

31:01.725 --> 31:02.863
We've got something.

31:02.898 --> 31:04.425
What hotel? What are
you even talking about?

31:04.449 --> 31:06.381
- She's in the house. Sevvy's got her.
- Don't play dumb.

31:06.405 --> 31:07.683
You texted me to meet you there.

31:07.707 --> 31:09.878
No, I didn't text you, baby.

31:09.913 --> 31:11.827
Look... Wolf took my phone.

31:11.861 --> 31:13.021
See?

31:13.055 --> 31:14.621
That's the car. Pull over.

31:18.005 --> 31:19.198
Does that mean you...

31:19.232 --> 31:21.436
you don't want to break up with me?

31:21.471 --> 31:24.108
Well, Wolf did a bad thing, okay?

31:24.143 --> 31:26.914
But maybe he had the right intentions.

31:26.949 --> 31:29.653
Look, there's so much heat
on me right now.

31:29.688 --> 31:32.426
Maybe we should just... lay low.

31:34.949 --> 31:36.498
Lay low.

31:37.271 --> 31:38.807
Just until things cool off.

31:40.914 --> 31:42.617
Yeah, I-I...

31:42.652 --> 31:43.853
I understand.

31:45.157 --> 31:46.392
You're dealing with a lot...

31:46.426 --> 31:48.039
- Yeah.
- And...

31:48.965 --> 31:51.303
I saw those tapes Jessica made.

31:51.337 --> 31:52.305
You did?

31:52.339 --> 31:53.975
They're hard to miss.

31:54.009 --> 31:57.292
It's just so unfair,
what people are saying.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.822
You know, those tapes
only show one side of you,

32:00.856 --> 32:03.094
and I wish the world
could see what I see.

32:03.128 --> 32:05.098
What do you see?

32:08.206 --> 32:10.612
Baby, I see the sun.

32:11.179 --> 32:15.921
And anyone who flies too close
might get burnt.

32:15.956 --> 32:17.358
She's back on script.

32:17.392 --> 32:19.471
That's my girl.

32:22.169 --> 32:24.773
When I see those bruises on Jessica,

32:24.808 --> 32:27.513
it's like someone else put them there.

32:27.547 --> 32:29.015
That's not me.

32:31.222 --> 32:35.062
I know, baby, and I'm still here.

32:35.096 --> 32:37.968
At least for one more night.

32:38.002 --> 32:41.008
Listen, when all this is done,

32:41.042 --> 32:43.312
when I clear my name,
I want us to be together.

32:43.347 --> 32:44.384
For real.

32:44.418 --> 32:46.189
When you clear your name?

32:46.721 --> 32:48.725
Those tapes of Jessica look pretty bad.

32:48.759 --> 32:51.898
All that's about to change.
I'll be out of this mess soon.

32:51.932 --> 32:52.966
How?

32:53.001 --> 32:55.338
There's something
that hasn't come out yet.

32:55.373 --> 32:57.042
Look, on the morning of the murder,

32:57.076 --> 32:58.211
I was at home, baby,

32:58.245 --> 33:00.716
and now there's a way to prove it.

33:00.751 --> 33:02.620
You mean like an alibi?

33:02.655 --> 33:05.226
I thought you... you didn't have one.

33:05.260 --> 33:06.529
No, no. This is something new.

33:06.564 --> 33:08.233
Wolf's got it all figured out.

33:08.267 --> 33:10.204
He's gonna get my doctor
to say she was here.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.475
My God. She did it.
She pulled it off.

33:12.509 --> 33:14.546
Wolf created a fake alibi?

33:14.581 --> 33:16.227
I mean, just when I think
he's hit rock bottom,

33:16.251 --> 33:17.385
he goes lower.

33:17.420 --> 33:18.922
Our girl took her power back.

33:18.957 --> 33:20.926
Good for her.

33:20.961 --> 33:23.432
You've already given me so much.

33:27.675 --> 33:28.904
Thank you.

33:30.281 --> 33:32.351
Now, let's get you the hell out of here.

33:32.385 --> 33:34.856
I've got a private way out, no paparazzi.

33:34.891 --> 33:36.527
Okay.

33:39.300 --> 33:40.936
There are fresh towels in the bathroom.

33:43.910 --> 33:45.379
You can stay as long as you like.

33:46.107 --> 33:48.285
You didn't tell me how you found me.

33:48.319 --> 33:50.389
Your dad was worried about you.

33:50.423 --> 33:52.287
He told me where you like to go.

33:56.403 --> 33:59.041
I'm just glad I got there when I did.

33:59.075 --> 34:01.379
What on Earth possessed you
to get into that fight, Gabe?

34:01.414 --> 34:02.582
It's not a big deal.

34:02.616 --> 34:04.586
It is a big deal.

34:05.565 --> 34:09.094
Your dad's not the only one
that's worried about you.

34:09.129 --> 34:10.864
Are you okay?

34:11.328 --> 34:13.170
Nothing is okay.

34:13.205 --> 34:15.342
I don't know what to do.

34:15.376 --> 34:19.384
I just feel really... alone and...

34:22.759 --> 34:25.530
You're not alone.

34:29.907 --> 34:32.359
I'm gonna help you through this.

34:35.585 --> 34:36.755
Keep the change.

34:36.789 --> 34:38.090
Thank you.

34:39.159 --> 34:41.364
47! Your order's up!

34:44.004 --> 34:45.473
48!

34:45.507 --> 34:46.909
Spicy pork?

34:46.943 --> 34:48.246
Ooh..

34:49.849 --> 34:52.254
I prefer my tacos poolside in Cabo.

34:52.855 --> 34:54.123
Why am I here?

34:55.161 --> 34:56.357
There's something

34:56.382 --> 34:57.966
that hasn't come out yet.

34:58.001 --> 34:59.436
Look, on the morning of the murder,

34:59.470 --> 35:00.619
I was at home, baby,

35:00.653 --> 35:02.175
and now there's a way to prove it.

35:02.209 --> 35:04.380
You mean like an alibi?

35:04.414 --> 35:06.484
I thought you... you didn't have one.

35:06.518 --> 35:08.188
No, no. This is something new.

35:08.222 --> 35:09.658
Wolf's got it all figured out.

35:09.692 --> 35:11.829
He's gonna get my doctor
to say she was here.

35:14.035 --> 35:15.336
How the hell did you get this?

35:15.370 --> 35:17.073
Doesn't matter how I got it.

35:17.108 --> 35:19.512
That's your client on tape
telling his mistress

35:19.546 --> 35:22.351
about the fake alibi
you cooked up for him.

35:22.385 --> 35:24.651
You ran a wire on Dia Briseño.

35:26.928 --> 35:29.533
Well, that won't go as far as you think,

35:29.567 --> 35:31.437
'cause I didn't hear "fake alibi"

35:31.471 --> 35:32.473
anywhere on that tape.

35:32.508 --> 35:35.081
Wolf, first you drive
Ben Mitchell to suicide...

35:35.115 --> 35:37.083
- That was not my fault.
- Of course it was.

35:37.117 --> 35:39.354
He took a swan dive
off a 20-story building

35:39.388 --> 35:40.957
because of what you did to him.

35:40.992 --> 35:43.029
Not everyone can
take the high road, Maya.

35:43.063 --> 35:45.534
Personally, I think the air
up there's a little thin.

35:45.568 --> 35:48.741
This isn't about the high road
or the low road.

35:48.775 --> 35:50.745
This is about
the end of the road for you,

35:50.779 --> 35:53.417
because I'm not just building
a case against Sevvy now.

35:53.451 --> 35:55.489
I'm building a case to get you disbarred.

35:55.523 --> 35:57.762
And this is Exhibit "A."

35:58.529 --> 36:00.232
You sure you want to play that game?

36:00.266 --> 36:01.969
Yes, I am sure.

36:02.003 --> 36:03.472
And one more thing.

36:03.507 --> 36:05.977
I know about Sevvy's secret entrance.

36:06.012 --> 36:08.482
He used it to sneak Dia off his property.

36:08.517 --> 36:10.487
It is a massive hole in your case,

36:10.522 --> 36:12.792
and I'm gonna drive
a freight train through it.

36:12.826 --> 36:14.596
You're finished, Wolf.

36:14.630 --> 36:17.335
Sevvy's going down for murder,
and you're going with him.

36:27.091 --> 36:31.542
How much paperwork can there be
for one stinking wire?

36:31.543 --> 36:33.714
Your reward for pulling an all-nighter.

36:33.748 --> 36:36.386
You remembered. Porto's.

36:36.420 --> 36:38.323
How could I forget?

36:38.357 --> 36:41.530
You and me, our first wire in Burbank.

36:41.565 --> 36:43.234
100 degrees.

36:43.268 --> 36:45.238
We sat there all night,
came up with nothing.

36:47.243 --> 36:49.614
We got a box of these,

36:49.648 --> 36:52.186
and we watched the sunrise.

36:54.391 --> 36:56.194
- How's our witness?
- She's good.

36:56.229 --> 36:57.898
A little shaken.

36:57.932 --> 37:00.604
CJ's taking her
to the safe house in Oxnard.

37:00.638 --> 37:02.246
Sounds like quite a night.

37:02.281 --> 37:03.309
Should've been there.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.917
No, really.

37:06.951 --> 37:08.822
I've never seen you happier

37:08.856 --> 37:11.293
than when you're in
the trenches, doing the work.

37:11.327 --> 37:13.265
You should have been there.

37:15.370 --> 37:17.106
Can I ask you something?

37:17.140 --> 37:18.475
Sure.

37:19.712 --> 37:22.751
I know being chief deputy
is important to you,

37:22.785 --> 37:24.421
and I have no right

37:24.455 --> 37:27.093
to judge the choices you made
while I was away.

37:27.128 --> 37:31.102
But I wonder...

37:31.137 --> 37:33.173
is this really you?

37:44.532 --> 37:46.535
I didn't realize.
How hard this was gonna be.

37:46.569 --> 37:48.874
Working the case?

37:51.580 --> 37:52.581
No.

37:54.921 --> 37:56.891
Having you back.

38:06.410 --> 38:08.080
Enjoy.

38:20.809 --> 38:22.144
Is this your car?

38:22.178 --> 38:24.549
I thought it was D.A. Wiest's.

38:24.583 --> 38:25.819
My mistake.

38:25.853 --> 38:27.221
What the hell are you doing here?

38:27.256 --> 38:29.293
You look like you had a rough night.

38:30.095 --> 38:32.968
Maybe it was because you were
running a wire on Dia Briseño.

38:34.738 --> 38:36.326
You think I wouldn't find out?

38:36.361 --> 38:37.937
Get your hands off me.

38:38.513 --> 38:40.783
Maya's still freezing me out.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.788
I wasn't a part of the wire.

38:42.823 --> 38:45.828
You know, in all my days on this Earth,

38:45.862 --> 38:47.665
no one's ever gotten away
with lying to me.

38:47.699 --> 38:50.304
I'm not lying.

38:52.877 --> 38:54.035
We'll see.

39:12.753 --> 39:14.589
Keep walking.

39:27.117 --> 39:29.187
It's a pleasure doing business.

39:31.660 --> 39:34.631
You ever need anything else...

39:34.666 --> 39:35.908
a cousin you need roughed up...

39:35.936 --> 39:37.939
I said it was a one-time thing.

39:38.608 --> 39:39.943
I meant it.

39:39.977 --> 39:41.580
Okay.

39:51.669 --> 39:53.806
This is not going the distance.

39:53.840 --> 39:55.243
Put 2OK under the line.

40:00.287 --> 40:01.990
Where the hell do you get off?!

40:02.024 --> 40:04.195
You think you can get rid of Dia
without asking me?

40:04.229 --> 40:06.599
Dia Briseño was a liability.

40:06.634 --> 40:07.802
She needed to be dealt with.

40:07.837 --> 40:08.938
- Dealt with?
- Yeah.

40:08.972 --> 40:11.610
Yeah? Well, thanks to you,
this is now trending.

40:11.645 --> 40:13.224
They're calling her
the "Fast and Furious Mistress."

40:13.248 --> 40:14.396
Yeah.

40:14.430 --> 40:17.557
I want to go public with the alibi now.

40:17.591 --> 40:19.127
Well, funny you should mention that.

40:19.161 --> 40:21.131
We no longer have an alibi.

40:21.165 --> 40:23.235
Apparently, your pants
are not the only thing

40:23.269 --> 40:24.538
you can't keep zipped.

40:24.573 --> 40:25.874
What are you talking about?

40:25.908 --> 40:28.746
Last night, during
your rendezvous with Dia,

40:28.781 --> 40:31.178
she was wearing a wire!

40:31.203 --> 40:33.600
Maya Travis has you blabbing on tape.

40:34.894 --> 40:35.828
What?

40:35.862 --> 40:38.267
You blew it, my friend.
Your alibi is dead.

40:38.301 --> 40:40.706
You're blaming this on me?

40:40.740 --> 40:42.386
If you'd have stayed
the hell out of my life,

40:42.410 --> 40:43.846
none of this would've happened.

40:43.880 --> 40:46.919
You know what?
I'm better off without you.

40:46.953 --> 40:48.381
You're fired.

40:48.957 --> 40:51.195
Do it. Fire me.

40:51.229 --> 40:52.898
I'll just go straight to the press

40:52.933 --> 40:54.902
and tell them I fired you,

40:54.937 --> 40:56.066
and that will crush you.

40:56.100 --> 40:57.642
But it'll crush you, too.

40:57.676 --> 40:59.780
Don't act like you don't
bloody need me, Wolf.

40:59.814 --> 41:00.858
Yeah.

41:00.892 --> 41:03.921
My money, my fame built all of this,

41:03.956 --> 41:05.158
and you bloody know it.

41:05.192 --> 41:06.275
Good point.

41:06.309 --> 41:08.231
Every time you make a stupid mistake,

41:08.265 --> 41:09.466
it's very good for business.

41:09.502 --> 41:11.738
Lucky for me, you're on a damn roll.

41:11.773 --> 41:12.774
Which reminds me,

41:12.808 --> 41:16.983
I need another million
to get us out of this mess.

41:17.017 --> 41:18.920
I got your bloody million.

41:19.890 --> 41:21.326
Sevvy! Sevvy!

41:24.567 --> 41:25.601
There's your million.

41:25.636 --> 41:27.439
You think this is a game?

41:27.473 --> 41:28.874
- No...
- This is my life!

41:28.909 --> 41:30.846
There's still a way we can win.

41:30.880 --> 41:31.992
We've been playing the short game.

41:32.016 --> 41:34.354
Now we need to play the long game.

41:34.388 --> 41:35.989
Sevvy, think.

41:36.024 --> 41:38.061
Who's the real enemy here?

41:38.096 --> 41:40.800
Who released the tape?
Who turned Dia against you?

41:40.835 --> 41:42.971
Who would stop at nothing
to see you rot in prison?

41:47.783 --> 41:48.851
Maya Travis.

41:48.885 --> 41:50.086
Maya Travis.

41:52.559 --> 41:54.313
What are you gonna do?

41:54.965 --> 41:57.903
I'm going to destroy her.

42:03.416 --> 42:04.851
Whoa.

42:07.124 --> 42:08.225
Thank you.

42:08.260 --> 42:10.096
Hey. Riv Allgood.

42:10.130 --> 42:11.064
You must be Michael.

42:11.099 --> 42:12.868
Michael Chapman.

42:12.903 --> 42:14.539
It's a beautiful place you got here.

42:14.573 --> 42:15.975
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

42:16.010 --> 42:17.422
So, you're in the market for a horse?

42:17.446 --> 42:18.915
I am.

42:18.949 --> 42:20.198
Let me give you a tour.
