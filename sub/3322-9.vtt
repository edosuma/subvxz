ATHELSTAN: "Caesar had sent his

00:54.640 --> 00:57.371
"and was following with
the rest of his forces.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.488

"and the sloping

01:07.200 --> 01:09.168
"The legions were
facing different ways

01:09.600 --> 01:11.489
"and fighting
different actions.

"The 9th and 10th

01:15.320 --> 01:17.846
"and discharged a volley of
spears at the Atrebates."

01:17.920 --> 01:21.686
Yes. Always thinking,
always using the terrain.

01:26.800 --> 01:29.280
"the Roman cavalry

01:29.400 --> 01:31.084
"seeming to appear
from nowhere..."

01:31.160 --> 01:34.687
Ah! But he knew where.
They were in here.

01:36.520 --> 01:39.524
And what of his person?
What of he himself?

01:42.080 --> 01:44.890
"As the situation
was critical,

01:45.000 --> 01:48.447
"Caesar moved to

"And shouted

01:55.240 --> 01:57.049
The fragment ends here. Hmm.

01:58.440 --> 02:00.727
We can imagine
how it really ends.

02:02.840 --> 02:06.890
We must do battle with Ragnar
Lothbrok and his allies.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.483
I cannot believe that Ragnar
does not want to negotiate.

02:12.520 --> 02:14.329
I know him too well.
He's looking for land,

02:14.400 --> 02:16.767
farming land,
for his people.

02:17.560 --> 02:21.724
His men killed all of my
envoys, sparing only my son.

02:22.360 --> 02:25.648
By which they sent me
a simple but clear message.

02:25.720 --> 02:27.643
Why not send me
to speak to him?

02:28.720 --> 02:29.926
(CLICKS TONGUE)

02:31.760 --> 02:34.843
You are already
too dear to me,

02:36.440 --> 02:38.169
and too important.

02:38.640 --> 02:41.405
Which is why, I think,
they would kill you.

02:46.640 --> 02:48.722
When? When will
you attack?

02:49.520 --> 02:52.922
As soon as King Aelle
returns with his warriors.

02:54.600 --> 02:58.605
I'm sure you would prefer that
Earl Ragnar and I made peace.

02:59.240 --> 03:02.164
Perhaps then you could be
at peace with yourself.

03:05.840 --> 03:09.162
LOTHBROK: King Horik, your behavior
has made it very difficult

03:09.240 --> 03:12.369
to talk peace or to
negotiate with King Ecbert.

03:12.440 --> 03:15.683
I never had any intention of
negotiating with King Ecbert.

03:15.760 --> 03:17.808
I thought you
were aware of that.

03:17.880 --> 03:22.204
I only want revenge.
I want to kill King Ecbert.

03:22.280 --> 03:24.521
And then, perhaps,
I shall talk to him.

03:27.120 --> 03:31.125
If we defeat Ecbert in battle, he
may be prepared to offer us more,

03:31.200 --> 03:34.966
in terms not only
of gold, but of land.

03:35.040 --> 03:37.327
This was a gift
in good faith.

03:37.920 --> 03:39.570
HORIK: What is good faith?

03:39.640 --> 03:43.167
Why should there be good faith
between us and Christians?

03:46.520 --> 03:48.443
What do you say, Floki?

03:50.440 --> 03:52.602
They worship a false god.

03:53.920 --> 03:55.968
They're fleas and vermin.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.922
I will go myself
and talk to him.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.209
You will not divide
our forces, Earl Ragnar.

04:02.280 --> 04:04.408
You seem to forget,
I am King.

04:06.200 --> 04:08.771
We will strike
camp tomorrow,

04:08.840 --> 04:11.002
and armed and ready
we will go to seek battle,

04:11.080 --> 04:13.686

has taught us.

BJORN: I can't sleep.

04:44.720 --> 04:47.087
I am thinking about
what it is like to die.

04:49.000 --> 04:51.287
Only those who have
died would know.

04:52.960 --> 04:54.724
The Seer would know.

04:54.800 --> 04:57.690
He is not truly dead.
That is his curse.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.287
He told me
something about you.

05:05.720 --> 05:08.246
That you would marry
the daughter of a King,

05:08.720 --> 05:12.247
or else sail round a sea
that has no tides.

05:13.400 --> 05:15.368
Then I shall not
die tomorrow?

05:16.640 --> 05:18.642
Not according
to the Seer.

05:25.920 --> 05:30.050
Bjorn reminds me of Odin's
favorite son, Balder.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.809
You know the story.

05:35.200 --> 05:39.444
The gods made everyone swear
an oath that he would be safe.

05:41.240 --> 05:43.527
Fire swore an oath.

05:44.880 --> 05:47.804
Water, iron.

05:48.280 --> 05:50.169
Even the stones.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.609
Nothing could injure
Odin's favorite son.

05:54.800 --> 05:56.768
The gods even
tested the oaths.

05:57.440 --> 05:59.010
They threw
stones at him,

05:59.080 --> 06:01.731
darts, struck him
with axes,

06:01.840 --> 06:04.127
and slashed at him
with swords,

06:05.000 --> 06:08.846
but it seems nothing
could harm Balder.

06:10.120 --> 06:13.761
Everyone rejoiced that it was
impossible to harm Balder.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.849
All except Loki.

06:19.440 --> 06:24.321
The sly one watched with
distaste and impatience.

06:25.080 --> 06:28.448
Suffering and pain were
meat and drink to him.

06:28.920 --> 06:31.287
And it sickened him to see
how Balder was immune

06:31.360 --> 06:33.601
from all sorts
of attacks.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.241
Yes.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.811
The sly one knew he had to
find a way to kill him.

06:56.160 --> 06:59.050
I pray to the gods that
the Seer was right.

07:00.960 --> 07:03.725
That our son will
not die tomorrow.

07:08.160 --> 07:11.289
No. You are Ragnar.

07:13.000 --> 07:15.651

I have seen the sparks

Horik was right.

20:51.840 --> 20:53.569

We've won half

23:05.720 --> 23:09.930
Now, with God's help, we'll
annihilate our enemies, hmm?

23:10.000 --> 23:13.766
Forgive me, King Aelle,
but I might suggest

23:13.840 --> 23:17.731
that even the complete
destruction of one Northern army

23:17.800 --> 23:19.848
will not lead to the end
of their incursions.

23:19.960 --> 23:21.564
Probably quite
the opposite.

23:21.640 --> 23:25.326
Motivated by greed and
by the need for revenge,

23:25.400 --> 23:28.324
they're very likely to return
with renewed strength.

23:28.400 --> 23:33.281
And not just once or twice,
but again and again,

23:33.360 --> 23:35.601
times without number.

23:36.320 --> 23:39.324
The only way to bring an
end to these incursions

23:39.400 --> 23:42.927
is to negotiate an agreement
that is good for both sides.

23:43.000 --> 23:46.925
But, in the meantime,
King Aelle,

23:47.760 --> 23:51.287
buying the services of these
Northmen as mercenaries

23:51.360 --> 23:54.330
will certainly help us
to overcome Mercia.

23:55.520 --> 23:56.601
Mmm.

23:57.720 --> 24:00.724
Very well.
As you say.

24:02.200 --> 24:06.489
But someone has to take
this offer to the pagans.

24:06.560 --> 24:09.370
That is if they have not yet
already sailed away.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.326
Indeed.

24:12.400 --> 24:16.166
Considering their treatment
of our envoys so far,

24:16.240 --> 24:18.322
you're not going to have
too many volunteers.

24:18.960 --> 24:20.371
(LAUGHING)

24:21.680 --> 24:23.045
I have a suggestion.

24:24.120 --> 24:25.849
I think we should
send Athelstan.

24:29.200 --> 24:30.531
But they may kill him.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.921
(LAUGHING)
Oh, I doubt that.

25:30.040 --> 25:32.646
I wanted to kill you
when I was a child.

25:33.440 --> 25:35.124
And then I loved you.

close to your uncle.

I came here to talk to you.

26:02.440 --> 26:03.601

26:04.200 --> 26:06.646
You do his bidding.
You are one of them.

26:07.160 --> 26:09.208
He offers you
a chance for peace.

26:10.160 --> 26:13.607
He wants to talk of many things with you.
Good things.

26:13.680 --> 26:15.569
Yes, and then kill us.

26:15.640 --> 26:18.723
No. He will not,
I swear. I know him.

26:18.800 --> 26:21.690
You are his dog.
You lick his fingers.

26:22.360 --> 26:23.850

to offer us a hostage?

26:37.400 --> 26:38.447
Yes.

26:39.440 --> 26:41.761
He wants to reassure you,
in any way he can,

26:41.840 --> 26:43.729
of his honest intentions.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.404

(MUFFLED GROANING)

43:44.480 --> 43:45.766
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

43:46.720 --> 43:48.051

(BONES CRUNCHING)
(SCREAMING)

43:51.880 --> 43:52.881
Splint.

43:54.480 --> 43:55.641
Splint.

HORIK: Floki.

44:20.760 --> 44:23.764
We can be honest with each
other, can we not, hmm?

44:24.920 --> 44:27.241
We know each other
well enough.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.965
We know the things we
like and those we hate.

We share many things.

44:36.880 --> 44:39.770
Many ideas, feelings,

44:40.760 --> 44:44.606
about the Earth
and the gods.

44:46.040 --> 44:48.281

Yes.

I have a proposition
to put to you.
