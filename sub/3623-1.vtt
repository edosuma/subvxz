They've adapted
my mom's cyber-robotics.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.108
And this is bad because...

19:37.110 --> 19:39.010
Trust me, it's bad.

19:39.012 --> 19:41.412
Then we have to be badder.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.218
Aw, no way!

19:47.220 --> 19:49.253
She took my wheels!
That is bogus!

19:49.255 --> 19:53.157
As if that's any
match for my doom-v.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.993
Of course, laser fire.

19:55.995 --> 20:00.097
Whoa, chill, dude. You almost
hit my bike. Seriously.

20:00.099 --> 20:03.901
Um, dude?
That's the idea!

20:06.972 --> 20:09.307
Well, this is bad.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.215
Boo-yah! One
for the good guys!

20:17.950 --> 20:20.184
Oh. Boo-yah denied.

20:20.186 --> 20:22.086
Aah!

20:22.088 --> 20:22.886
Are you all right?

20:22.888 --> 20:24.822
A few scratches,
but we're fine.

20:24.824 --> 20:28.159
[Moans then laughs]

20:28.161 --> 20:29.293
Hit it.

20:29.295 --> 20:31.195
Dude, you totally
cashed my bike.

20:31.197 --> 20:35.466
Now watch as I cash Kim
Possible once and for all.

20:35.468 --> 20:39.136
No way! You smashed my bike,
so I get to smash red.

20:39.138 --> 20:40.504
I've known her longer than you.

20:40.506 --> 20:42.506
Dude, come on.
Seriously.

20:42.508 --> 20:43.506
I'll give you seriously.

20:43.508 --> 20:47.011
Drakken adapted the
cyber-robotics from my chair...

20:47.113 --> 20:48.212
We could link the two.

20:48.214 --> 20:50.248
Hey, great minds think alike.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.048
Yeah! What?

20:51.150 --> 20:54.218
Crunch time, wade. Need a
cyberlink 10 minutes ago.

20:54.220 --> 20:54.918
I'm in.

20:54.920 --> 20:57.188
The robotic signature's
the same. Easy hook-up,

20:57.190 --> 20:58.289
but you'll need some sort of...

20:58.291 --> 20:59.189
Controller?
That'll do.

20:59.291 --> 21:01.993
I'm the evil genius,
I do the crushing.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.394
Bogus, dude, seriously.

21:03.396 --> 21:06.831
Bah! That's it.
I'll do it.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.434
[Power shuts down]

21:10.436 --> 21:11.134
What did you do?

21:11.236 --> 21:13.537
N-nothing. It just
stopped working.

21:13.539 --> 21:17.208
How about a little
mayhem of my own?

21:24.249 --> 21:26.317
This is fun.

21:30.289 --> 21:33.824
I think I'm gonna barf,
man. Seriously.

21:33.826 --> 21:36.927
Boo-yah reinstated!
Game over!

21:36.929 --> 21:38.195
Oh, no!

21:38.197 --> 21:42.133
My little Drewby would
never hurt a fly.

21:42.135 --> 21:45.136
It's all Eddie's
fault, officer.

21:45.138 --> 21:46.837
He's a bad seed.

21:46.839 --> 21:48.539
Just look at his hairdo.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.042
Mother, it's a mullet.
Seriously.

21:51.044 --> 21:54.145
Right on, dude.
'Cause you're ready.

21:54.147 --> 21:54.912
Air guitar.

21:54.914 --> 21:57.281
♪ Ya-a-a-a-ah

21:57.283 --> 22:00.051
well, Kim, you've got to
come with us next week

22:00.053 --> 22:02.153
to the ultimate
zombie fight tourney.

22:02.155 --> 22:02.753
You rule.

22:02.755 --> 22:05.556
And you said video games
weren't your thing.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.091
Pshaw!

22:07.093 --> 22:07.891
Yeah. About that.

22:07.893 --> 22:11.162
Look, I won't tell Felix
about your cheat codes,

22:11.164 --> 22:12.496
as long as you
don't tell anyone

22:12.498 --> 22:14.565
that I had no idea
what I was doing.

22:14.567 --> 22:15.966
I just kept hitting buttons.

22:15.968 --> 22:19.203
Wait, you beat
the bad guys by accident?

22:19.205 --> 22:21.405
Seriously.
