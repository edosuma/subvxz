01:34.553 --> 01:38.765
[Pop] They lose 65 games only to end
up with the fourth pick in the draft.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.892
Did they tank that shit on purpose?

01:40.976 --> 01:43.562
Read the words, Pop. Right
there on the wall.

01:43.645 --> 01:46.523
Brother's got a point, Henry,
much as I hate to admit that.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.149
That's right. Pay up.

01:48.233 --> 01:50.276
You're right, you're
right. I shouldn't have cursed.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.947
- My bad, Lonnie.
- It's okay, Pop.

01:54.030 --> 01:55.031
[Pop chuckles] All right.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.325
What's their record this
year, anyway, like?

01:57.408 --> 01:58.869
[Pop] 17 and 65.

01:59.620 --> 02:02.456
You know that Russian kid they
drafted? He better be good.

02:02.539 --> 02:03.790
He's Latvian.

02:03.874 --> 02:06.167
What they need to do
is fire Phil Jackson.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.687
[Pop] Wait a minute, Phil Jackson
ain't out there playing no more.

02:08.711 --> 02:10.464
Phil Jackson overrated, B.

02:10.547 --> 02:12.591
Anybody can win with Jordan and Kobe.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.343
Phil ain't no Pat Riley.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.513
- [all groaning]
- Aw, Riley, again?

02:17.596 --> 02:18.639
- [Pop] Yeah.
- Here we go.

02:18.722 --> 02:20.265
[Chico] I mean, Pacino...

02:20.348 --> 02:22.726
Now, I get why that white
boy makes your free haircut list.

02:22.809 --> 02:28.398
The Godfather and Scarface guaranteed
that man an eternal ghetto pass.

02:28.482 --> 02:29.584
- Carlito's Way, too.
- [Shameek] Mmm-hmm.

02:29.608 --> 02:31.317
- [Chico] But Pat Riley?
- [Pop] Yeah.

02:31.401 --> 02:33.420
[Chico] Why does Pat Riley get
so much love in this shop?

02:33.444 --> 02:37.240
Right. Even punk-ass Derek
Fisher got more rings than Pat Riley.

02:37.323 --> 02:38.408
Uh-uh.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.618
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

02:39.701 --> 02:42.871
'Cause the Knicks played like
men when Pat Riley was head coach.

02:42.954 --> 02:45.123
Oakley and Ewing went hard in the paint.

02:45.206 --> 02:47.626
Plus Anthony Mason and John Starks?

02:47.709 --> 02:50.336
Drive the lane, you might
go home in a body bag.

02:50.420 --> 02:51.963
All right, now I heard that.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.715
Later with all that Instagramming,

02:53.799 --> 02:56.176
"let's all max contract on the
same team together" bullcrap

02:56.259 --> 02:58.154
- passing as competition nowadays.
- [all laughing]

02:58.178 --> 02:59.846
[Pop laughs] Mmm. Yeah.

02:59.930 --> 03:03.016
[scoffs] Didn't Pat Riley sign those
Instagram dudes down in Miami

03:03.099 --> 03:04.851
when he became the GM?

03:04.935 --> 03:06.477
[scoffs] Maybe.

03:07.478 --> 03:10.691
But King James is the
truth. LeBron can ball.

03:10.774 --> 03:12.568
[Pop chuckles] Yeah.

03:12.651 --> 03:14.903
Now pay up, Luke. You said "bullcrap."

03:14.986 --> 03:17.405
"Bullcrap" ain't a
curse, man. I don't curse.

03:17.488 --> 03:19.658
- [imitating Luke] "I don't curse."
- [laughs]

03:19.741 --> 03:21.284
You don't cut hair either, negro.

03:21.367 --> 03:24.454
Like, really, what do
you do up in here, bruh?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.832
I sweep hair, Shameek.

03:26.915 --> 03:29.751
I also mop, I wash the towels,

03:29.835 --> 03:32.629
and I make sure that plate
glass window stays spotless.

03:32.713 --> 03:35.882
It's called work. Something
you would never understand.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.050
[scoffs]

03:38.635 --> 03:41.304
Slam Magazine... Hmm?

03:42.513 --> 03:44.725
Coaches used to live
up in this piece, son.

03:45.601 --> 03:48.103
Kevin Ollie got a
shape-up right there from Pop's.

03:48.186 --> 03:49.395
Pitino, too.

03:50.939 --> 03:54.150
Stylin' and profilin', that's my work.

03:54.234 --> 03:56.152
- See what I'm sayin'? Yeah?
- Yeah. Tell him.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.696
For real?

03:59.405 --> 04:01.116
Doc Rivers, uh, call you yet, Shameek?

04:01.199 --> 04:03.118
[chuckling] Whoa, all right. Play nice.

04:03.201 --> 04:06.079
- You can't even afford a haircut.
- [Shameek] Hey, you know what?

04:06.162 --> 04:08.039
- I'm about sick and tired of...
- [Luke] What?

04:09.833 --> 04:11.752
Hmm?

04:11.835 --> 04:13.461
You sick and tired of what?

04:16.757 --> 04:20.093
About sick and tired of the
Knicks losin' all the time, man!

04:21.052 --> 04:22.303
- [Shameek sighs]
- [chuckles]

04:22.387 --> 04:23.805
[chuckling]

04:23.889 --> 04:26.516
You got some hair, too, right there.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.019
- I'm not finished.
- Yes, you are.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.228
[door opens and bell dings]

04:31.229 --> 04:34.107
- Hey, Counselor.
- Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.401
I haven't even passed the bar yet.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.070
- Oh, you will.
- [chuckles]

04:39.154 --> 04:41.782
Lonnie, you got Kumon tonight. Let's go.

04:41.865 --> 04:44.159
Come on, boy, you heard your mama.

04:44.242 --> 04:45.326
Let's get moving.

04:45.410 --> 04:47.578
Don't make me repeat myself.

04:48.538 --> 04:49.623
[chuckles]

04:53.001 --> 04:54.169
Hey, Luke.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.755
What time you get off?

04:59.966 --> 05:02.385
I got another job I go to
right after I leave this one.

05:02.468 --> 05:06.389
[sighs] Black man working. Ain't
nothing wrong with that.

05:06.472 --> 05:10.518
[inhales] Well, we should at least
try to get some coffee some time.

05:22.572 --> 05:24.700
Maybe you'll need a lawyer one day.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.286
Hopefully, you'll have
some cards by then.

05:28.369 --> 05:29.663
[chuckles]

05:31.622 --> 05:32.749
[Pop chuckles] Hey.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.960
Be sure and tell Bessie I said hey.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.795
- I will.
- Mmm-hmm.

05:45.136 --> 05:47.848
How's a woman that fine with a briefcase

05:47.931 --> 05:50.141
gonna throw it at a
brother with a broom?

05:50.225 --> 05:52.185
That's what you don't get, youngin.

05:52.268 --> 05:54.062
Either you have it or you don't.

05:54.145 --> 05:56.189
- [chuckling]
- Oh, I know I got it.

05:56.272 --> 05:58.483
Shit. [indistinct muttering]

05:58.566 --> 06:01.444
[Pop] Whoa, whoa. See the
words... right there on the wall.

06:01.527 --> 06:03.947
- [scoffs]
- Hmm?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.783
- [Pop] Pay up.
- Come on, Pop.

06:06.867 --> 06:08.744
[dryer whirring]

06:23.884 --> 06:26.302
[Pop] Huh, there you go again.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.598
I shook everything else after I got out.

06:30.681 --> 06:33.184
Cigarettes, paranoia...

06:33.268 --> 06:34.978
But the pacing?

06:35.061 --> 06:38.356
I do it, too. [grunts softly]

06:39.607 --> 06:40.984
Reva again?

06:41.943 --> 06:43.236
Reva always.

06:47.908 --> 06:49.617
Look, it's been long enough.

06:49.700 --> 06:52.328
Give Patty a call. She's a good woman.

06:52.412 --> 06:53.496
[scoffs]

06:54.414 --> 06:56.041
I don't drink coffee much.

06:57.458 --> 06:58.709
I don't think she does either.

06:58.794 --> 07:01.838
[chuckles] Like she said, "Ain't
nothing wrong with that."

07:03.464 --> 07:05.341
When I'm ready, I'm ready.

07:05.425 --> 07:10.221
But you'll want a cup of something
hot and dark sooner or later...

07:10.305 --> 07:12.182
Mr. Bulletproof.

07:12.265 --> 07:15.101
- [chuckling]
- There you go with the nicknames, Pop.

07:15.185 --> 07:19.564
You said your rebound chick took
a shotgun at point-blank range...

07:20.273 --> 07:22.317
pointed it under your chin,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.152
and pulled the trigger.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.029
I still get the occasional headache.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.823
Not a problem for you, Power Man.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.449
[chuckling]

07:30.533 --> 07:32.160
[Luke grunts]

07:35.121 --> 07:37.373
Mmm-mmm. [chuckles]

07:38.416 --> 07:41.461
I love it when you do
stuff like that. [chuckling]

07:41.544 --> 07:43.880
You should be out there helping
people, that's all,

07:43.964 --> 07:45.882
like them other fellas downtown.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.467
Reva used to say the same thing.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.635
Yeah, well, she was right.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.555
You don't ever think about all
the people you could help?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.975
You should be more ambitious.

07:56.559 --> 07:59.896
What if my ambition is to sweep hair...

07:59.980 --> 08:01.314
wash dishes...

08:02.232 --> 08:04.025
and be left the hell alone?

08:04.109 --> 08:06.194
Well, that would be a waste.

08:06.277 --> 08:08.071
You think I asked for any of this?

08:09.322 --> 08:12.158
I was framed, beaten...

08:12.242 --> 08:15.120
and put in some tank
like an exotic fish.

08:17.455 --> 08:20.041
Came out with...

08:20.125 --> 08:21.459
abilities.

08:21.542 --> 08:23.044
Saved your life.

08:23.128 --> 08:24.880
More like ruined it.

08:26.882 --> 08:28.758
Reva's dead. [exhales]

08:29.885 --> 08:31.344
I'm a fugitive.

08:31.427 --> 08:33.096
So?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.722
Take my advice, brother.

08:36.557 --> 08:39.102
The past is the past.

08:39.184 --> 08:42.147
And the only direction in
life that matters is forward.

08:42.230 --> 08:43.648
Never backwards.

08:45.441 --> 08:46.985
I'm just living my life...

08:47.944 --> 08:49.487
day to day.

08:49.570 --> 08:51.697
[hip-hop music playing over speakers]

08:58.204 --> 09:00.706
Why don't you watch
where you going, man?

09:11.592 --> 09:12.969
What's the gun for, Chico?

09:13.929 --> 09:16.890
[scoffs] Is your name Wilfredo Diaz?

09:17.891 --> 09:20.351
'Cause he walked out on me
and moms when I was nine.

09:20.435 --> 09:23.313
I ain't need a daddy
then and I don't need one now.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.441
[car engine starts]

09:32.072 --> 09:33.698
- Let's get this money.
- Yeah.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.537
Tsk.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.376
Hey, Pop, I gotta go. I'm runnin' late.

09:45.460 --> 09:49.630
Hey. Look, if I wasn't paying you
in cash, I could be paying you more.

09:49.714 --> 09:52.092
You wouldn't have to
be workin' two jobs.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.011
I gotta do what I gotta do.

09:56.346 --> 09:57.805
Always forward.

09:57.888 --> 09:59.890
Forward. Always.

10:01.142 --> 10:02.393
[sighs]

10:04.145 --> 10:06.147
[indistinct chatter]

10:20.911 --> 10:22.622
[vendor] Hey, yo, my man, my man.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.916
All HD. Got it right here. Blu-ray,
too, 'cause I'm nice like that.

10:26.001 --> 10:29.462
Tony Stark, the big blonde
dude with the hammer,

10:29.545 --> 10:30.713
the old dude with the shield,

10:30.796 --> 10:33.341
the green monster, and I
don't mean Fenway.

10:33.424 --> 10:35.593
You can't get better raw
footage of the incident

10:35.676 --> 10:37.553
anywhere else than right here.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.855
- Hey, Luke.
- [Luke chuckles]

10:47.938 --> 10:49.232
Every time.

10:49.315 --> 10:52.360
It's the bleach. I can smell
it from around the corner.

10:52.443 --> 10:55.321
Pop has got you washing
towels again, huh?

10:57.115 --> 11:00.618
Yeah, I took a New
Yorker off the top for you.

11:00.701 --> 11:03.246
Can't tell you what's
on the cover, though.

11:03.329 --> 11:06.666
Hey, I hope you got Connie's rent money.

11:06.749 --> 11:08.084
She's on the warpath.

11:08.168 --> 11:09.502
- [chuckles]
- Thanks, Ollie.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.921
[Ollie] Mmm-hmm.

11:26.102 --> 11:29.522
Ten days late, Mr.
Cage. I need my rent money.

11:31.899 --> 11:33.068
[sighs]

11:39.865 --> 11:40.866
Here.

11:41.492 --> 11:43.911
I count $300. Not enough.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.664
Let me go to work and get the rest.

11:46.747 --> 11:48.124
Tonight.

11:56.757 --> 11:59.635
[audience applauding and cheering]

12:02.472 --> 12:05.266
[R&B music playing]

12:05.350 --> 12:08.686
[woman singing]

12:10.105 --> 12:12.398
- [music continues playing]
- [indistinct chatter]

13:25.346 --> 13:28.266
I need a favor. Short one
bartender. Dante's sick.

13:28.349 --> 13:29.809
You got the cash you promised me?

13:29.892 --> 13:32.478
- End of the week.
- Come on, Nate.

13:32.562 --> 13:34.243
You can keep all your
tips out there, okay?

13:34.272 --> 13:35.707
When was the last time you made drinks?

13:35.731 --> 13:37.192
I know the drill.

13:37.275 --> 13:38.693
Okay, okay. Clean up.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.028
Put a shirt and jacket
on. Mr. Stokes has standards.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.697
Though you can't tell by what he pays.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.948
Excuse me?

14:01.882 --> 14:03.509
Raphael Saadiq.

14:03.593 --> 14:06.596
- He's as good live as you said he was.
- Even better.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.248
So you're not impressed by all this?

14:11.309 --> 14:13.686
I've always been proud of you.

14:13.769 --> 14:17.565
[Stokes] This place was a roach
trap by the time Mama Mabel died.

14:17.648 --> 14:19.024
Now look at it.

14:20.067 --> 14:24.405
Harlem's Paradise. May as
well be the new Cotton Club.

14:24.489 --> 14:26.407
Then I shouldn't be up in here tonight.

14:27.908 --> 14:29.785
Well...

14:29.869 --> 14:31.496
Madam Councilwoman...

14:32.580 --> 14:36.083
Colon's Gym is ready to make a
sizable donation to my pocket...

14:36.166 --> 14:38.419
and your real estate project.

14:38.503 --> 14:40.546
Sometimes you need a face-to-face.

14:40.630 --> 14:42.382
"Colon's Gym"?

14:43.299 --> 14:46.636
Is that what that two-bit drug
dealer is puttin' on his tax returns?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.304
[laughs]

14:48.388 --> 14:49.972
Why do you even waste time with him?

14:51.807 --> 14:54.810
Politics is where the power is, Cornell.

14:54.894 --> 14:57.730
Forget about all this other noise.

14:57.813 --> 14:59.690
My noise keeps you flush.

15:00.691 --> 15:05.154
All that "keep Harlem black" rack-a-bully-ack
might get you re-elected.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.324
- Damn skippy.
- But when the smoke clears...

15:08.408 --> 15:10.785
it's niggas like me that let
you hold on to what you got.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.828
You know I despise that word.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.289
I know.

15:15.373 --> 15:17.542
It's easy to underestimate a nigga.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.795
They never see you coming.

15:29.470 --> 15:31.847
- What's that?
- It's a cosmo.

15:35.225 --> 15:38.688
[chuckles] Your jacket's a little small.

15:40.523 --> 15:41.691
So is your dress.

15:44.402 --> 15:45.903
Touché.

15:50.866 --> 15:53.744
- Cornell, my man.
- Champagne.

15:53.801 --> 15:55.723
- [Stokes] All right.
- Councilwoman.

15:55.746 --> 15:58.749
- What are you two celebrating?
- Success.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.503
Partnership that should have
happened a long time ago, had...

16:02.587 --> 16:05.423
my uncle and your brother had their way.

16:05.506 --> 16:07.174
Uncle Pete was good people.

16:08.092 --> 16:09.594
Salvador really liked Pete.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.305
Anytime.

16:19.937 --> 16:22.189
- [Luke] Lookin' for somethin'?
- No.

16:23.065 --> 16:26.736
Saadiq's still got it. [chuckles]

16:26.819 --> 16:28.237
Stone Rollin' was a dope album.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.574
[chuckling] "Album"? Now
I know you're an old head.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.870
You ain't no spring
chicken neither, sucker.

16:36.787 --> 16:38.456
Touché.

16:42.126 --> 16:43.794
[chuckling]

16:43.878 --> 16:46.130
[man] All right. So let
me get this straight.

16:46.213 --> 16:48.257
I give your cousin a contribution

16:48.341 --> 16:50.718
and it's like a get out of
jail free card for me, right?

16:50.801 --> 16:52.302
That's something to celebrate.

16:52.387 --> 16:54.764
No, I don't do that.

16:54.847 --> 16:56.349
[chuckles]

16:56.432 --> 16:58.183
[inhales] See, me...

16:58.267 --> 17:01.937
I celebrate when things are
finished. Not when it's just starting.

17:02.021 --> 17:04.022
[woman] Listen to him.

17:04.106 --> 17:06.942
This is nothing to celebrate.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.778
You saw what happened to Fisk.

17:08.861 --> 17:11.571
You two shouldn't even
be seen together...

17:11.656 --> 17:13.866
let alone having me all
up in the Kool-Aid.

17:14.617 --> 17:18.454
But you're here anyway. Something
must be right about it.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.665
Otherwise, you wouldn't have
fronted me if you didn't agree.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.419
I have no illusions about
our family's legacy.

17:24.502 --> 17:29.757
But you are now turning legitimate
money illegal all over again.

17:29.840 --> 17:33.719
[chuckles] What's illegal about it?

17:33.803 --> 17:36.806
Our product is protected
by the Constitution.

17:36.889 --> 17:39.934
But you came to me because
you trust me, Domingo.

17:40.017 --> 17:42.227
[R&B music playing]

17:48.901 --> 17:52.071
In your business, people need my
product like a fish needs water.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.657
- He can buy his water anywhere.
- Nah.

17:55.783 --> 17:57.284
What I sell is pure.

17:57.367 --> 18:01.038
<i>This the kind of shit that
could blow a hole in a battleship.</i>

18:01.121 --> 18:04.208
<i>But it's light enough
to hold in your hand.</i>

18:04.291 --> 18:05.626
<i>Trust me, Domingo.</i>

18:05.710 --> 18:08.754
<i>You can brighten someone's
day permanently with this shit.</i>

18:08.838 --> 18:10.380
Top of the line.

18:11.048 --> 18:12.257
<i>The crème de la crème.</i>

18:12.341 --> 18:16.679
<i>This that grade A, military,
Justin Hammer-level shit.</i>

18:16.762 --> 18:20.558
A hundred large per
case. Ten cases, a cool mil.

18:20.641 --> 18:23.436
<i>Wholesale. Brand spanking new.</i>

18:23.519 --> 18:28.023
<i>No serial numbers... because
my connect is nice like that.</i>

18:28.107 --> 18:29.267
[Domingo] <i>Who's your connect?</i>

18:29.316 --> 18:31.819
[Stokes] <i>He's real and
his inventory runs deep.</i>

18:31.902 --> 18:34.113
- So that's it.
- That's it.

18:35.030 --> 18:37.617
- Easy-peasy.
- Nothing's ever that easy.

18:37.700 --> 18:40.119
So what happens after
they call to confirm?

18:40.202 --> 18:42.329
Everyone walks away happy.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.166
UPS ain't the only brown that delivers.

19:09.064 --> 19:10.190
My man.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.470
[gunfire]

19:58.781 --> 20:00.908
[audience applauding and cheering]

20:12.336 --> 20:16.215
[Shameek] Yeah, kid. That's
what I'm talkin' about.

20:16.298 --> 20:17.758
Yeah.

20:17.842 --> 20:19.509
Yo, you see this? Damn!

20:19.594 --> 20:21.887
[man] Yo! You wasn't
supposed to kill nobody, man!

20:21.971 --> 20:25.182
I had to make a move,
Dante. Shit went left. My bad.

20:25.265 --> 20:27.643
[gasping] Oh, my God. Oh, fuck. God.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.937
Shut up, Chico, before I
gag you with your panties.

20:30.020 --> 20:31.313
[coughing and vomiting]

20:31.396 --> 20:32.916
[Shameek] Yo, y'all see this money, B?

20:32.982 --> 20:35.693
Yo, this shit is like
some Hollywood shit for real.

20:35.776 --> 20:38.088
[Dante] Shameek, what am I gonna
do? They're gonna know it was me.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.923
B, there's, like, a
million dollars right here.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.324
Cottonmouth always lookin'
down at me at the bar.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.327
He's gonna know I'm gone. They
gonna know it was a inside job.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.788
- You right.
- [gunshot]

20:49.539 --> 20:50.875
What'd you do?

20:50.958 --> 20:52.501
- [breathing heavily]
- Yo, shit works.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.378
Yo, this shit works, Chico.

20:54.461 --> 20:56.505
Dante would have snitched.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.758
You see... you see how shook he was?

20:58.841 --> 21:00.300
Come on, man. I ain't...

21:00.384 --> 21:03.303
Ain't no way I'm splitting that
shit three ways no how, man.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.098
Dante was crew, B. That's Dante!

21:06.181 --> 21:09.143
Yo, I made a
decision. I'm gonna be rich.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.771
- [Chico breathing heavily]
- Let's go.

21:20.195 --> 21:22.698
[Shameek] Let's go! Come on!

21:25.242 --> 21:27.244
[R&B music playing]

21:43.844 --> 21:47.389
So you're a bench-warmer?
Or did you miss the cut?

21:47.472 --> 21:48.557
Excuse me?

21:49.183 --> 21:51.560
I just figured you were... one of his.

21:52.895 --> 21:54.396
One of Cottonmouth's?

21:54.479 --> 21:56.523
[chuckles] I hear he hates that name.

21:57.107 --> 21:59.568
- Mr. Stokes'...
- Cottonmouth's...

22:00.610 --> 22:01.821
Models.

22:02.947 --> 22:04.699
What makes you assume that?

22:05.658 --> 22:08.160
You're beautiful. But...

22:08.243 --> 22:09.829
But what?

22:11.580 --> 22:14.667
You're a little older than
he usually likes them.

22:14.750 --> 22:16.669
[chuckles]

22:16.752 --> 22:19.922
Yeah, you're definitely not
getting a tip tonight.

22:21.048 --> 22:22.257
But I'm not finished.

22:22.341 --> 22:23.968
Mmm.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.637
Dumb men like little girls.

22:27.722 --> 22:29.639
Me?

22:29.724 --> 22:31.641
I ponder a woman.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.021
Why don't you...

22:39.149 --> 22:41.736
ponder me another cosmo?

22:43.070 --> 22:44.864
[both chuckle]

22:46.073 --> 22:47.157
[Candace] Luke.

22:48.325 --> 22:49.451
Hey, Candace.

22:50.494 --> 22:51.787
You got promoted?

22:51.871 --> 22:54.248
Dante's out sick.

22:55.624 --> 22:56.792
You okay?

22:57.667 --> 23:00.504
Table seven wants six
bottles of Ace of Spades.

23:00.587 --> 23:02.047
I need you to help me carry them up.

23:07.302 --> 23:09.889
I don't like being up there by myself.

23:10.680 --> 23:13.392
I'm right behind you. Give me a second.

23:26.906 --> 23:31.160
Why don't you... ponder
that 'til I get back.

23:52.807 --> 23:54.724
You're a big one, eh?

23:54.809 --> 23:56.726
He's wearing a little jacket.

23:56.811 --> 23:58.813
[Stokes laughs]

24:00.189 --> 24:02.732
Haven't seen you behind the bar.

24:02.817 --> 24:04.484
Where's Dante?

24:05.861 --> 24:07.446
Called in sick, I guess.

24:08.738 --> 24:10.199
You want a job?

24:12.701 --> 24:15.579
I can find something more
suitable for a man your size.

24:16.496 --> 24:17.957
Better paying, too.

24:19.083 --> 24:21.293
You ever carried a gun?

24:22.086 --> 24:23.337
No.

24:24.588 --> 24:26.882
I'm good. Thanks.

24:34.890 --> 24:36.225
[Dante groaning]

24:43.858 --> 24:45.650
[cell phone ringing]

24:50.197 --> 24:51.615
Yeah?

24:56.078 --> 24:57.997
Shit. Fuck.

25:03.543 --> 25:05.212
[speaking indistinctly]

25:16.223 --> 25:18.100
[typing]

25:24.705 --> 25:26.501
You got to walk over
to Adam Clayton Powell

25:26.525 --> 25:28.068
if you wanna catch the bus.

25:32.531 --> 25:33.615
Uber?

25:34.699 --> 25:37.411
- That's what you were gonna press, right?
- What are you?

25:37.494 --> 25:40.414
- A cop?
- [chuckles] No.

25:41.706 --> 25:43.542
You just look cold.

25:49.589 --> 25:52.717
If you're looking for
Mr. Stokes, he just left.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.345
Who?

25:56.263 --> 25:57.639
Black Escalade.

25:58.682 --> 26:00.225
Tinted windows.

26:02.894 --> 26:06.481
Don't you have... somewhere
you need to be?

26:08.858 --> 26:10.152
Yeah.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.196
Home.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.489
Just got off.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.658
Congratulations.

26:23.415 --> 26:25.167
You wanna go grab a coffee?

26:34.343 --> 26:35.719
I don't like coffee.

26:36.345 --> 26:38.013
Neither do I.

26:42.392 --> 26:43.643
[keys clatter]

26:58.242 --> 26:59.909
[Luke exhales]

27:00.869 --> 27:02.871
[moans]

27:17.552 --> 27:19.804
[both breathing heavily]

27:44.288 --> 27:45.414
[Luke grunts]

27:54.464 --> 27:55.882
[Luke exhales]

28:01.721 --> 28:03.807
[men grunting]

28:03.890 --> 28:06.226
[cell phone ringing]

28:08.895 --> 28:10.522
- [gasps]
- [woman] When?

28:11.856 --> 28:13.442
I'm on my way in.

28:15.444 --> 28:16.695
[sighs]

28:20.199 --> 28:22.242
You talk in your sleep.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.245
What was I saying?

28:26.455 --> 28:29.333
Shades? Comanche?

28:29.416 --> 28:30.625
[Luke sighs]

28:35.380 --> 28:37.216
The job is calling me in.

28:37.299 --> 28:38.967
Can I call you later?

28:39.051 --> 28:42.887
[sighs] You'd need my
phone number for that.

28:48.810 --> 28:50.395
I know where you work.

28:50.479 --> 28:52.314
I'll find you.

28:53.690 --> 28:55.067
What is it you do again?

29:01.615 --> 29:02.824
[zipping]

29:02.907 --> 29:04.743
I'm an auditor.

29:07.329 --> 29:08.747
What's that?

29:11.083 --> 29:14.002
Basically, I look at
the financial books.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.380
Make sure everything's on the up and up.

29:17.339 --> 29:19.924
And you need a short dress for that?

29:24.429 --> 29:26.890
Sometimes you got to blend in.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.475
Impossible.

29:29.643 --> 29:31.770
You stand out in any room you're in.

30:36.460 --> 30:38.420
[machinery whirring]

30:39.921 --> 30:41.256
[camera shutters clicking]

30:51.266 --> 30:53.185
Dominicans? Cubans?

30:53.268 --> 30:54.478
Puerto Ricans.

30:55.395 --> 30:57.146
[Scarfe] Thought that
parade was last week.

30:57.231 --> 30:58.898
- Who can keep track?
- [both chuckling]

31:02.068 --> 31:04.279
Who do you think this
guy was trying to call?

31:04.946 --> 31:06.948
- Ghostbusters.
- [chuckles]

31:07.031 --> 31:08.617
He can laugh. You can't.

31:09.909 --> 31:12.412
Hey, Bailey. How you doing?

31:12.496 --> 31:15.207
It's another beautiful day at
the office. What's not to love?

31:15.290 --> 31:17.876
Don't you start
singing show tunes on me.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.631
Oh, shit.

31:23.548 --> 31:25.049
Dante Chapman.

31:25.133 --> 31:26.426
You know him?

31:27.761 --> 31:29.679
I know his mama.

31:33.267 --> 31:35.894
[Stokes] Of course it
wasn't a inside job.

31:36.811 --> 31:38.438
We had people die, too.

31:39.481 --> 31:42.484
Look... I don't have the stuff.

31:43.777 --> 31:46.905
Hmm. We need to talk
about this in person.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.948
My word is still my bond.

31:51.326 --> 31:52.827
Hello?

31:55.955 --> 31:57.291
That's Domingo?

31:59.251 --> 32:00.752
Yo, what's up?

32:00.835 --> 32:01.961
[sighs]

32:03.255 --> 32:05.507
It's above your pay grade.

32:05.590 --> 32:06.716
What?

32:07.759 --> 32:09.761
[man] Tell your man what's
going on, Cornell.

32:13.473 --> 32:14.849
Nice digs.

32:15.434 --> 32:17.894
Even nicer than when Mama Mabel ran it.

32:17.977 --> 32:19.438
Shades.

32:21.481 --> 32:22.816
When'd you come home?

32:22.899 --> 32:25.569
[takes deep breath] Ooh, a while ago.

32:25.652 --> 32:27.362
Seagate wasn't shit.

32:27.446 --> 32:28.863
Hmm.

32:30.073 --> 32:34.703
[clears throat]
So... what can I do for you?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.913
It's the other way around.

32:38.122 --> 32:39.666
Y'all got hit last night.

32:40.667 --> 32:42.627
That expensive, exclusive,

32:42.711 --> 32:45.297
hard-to-get hardware that
Diamondback gave you

32:45.380 --> 32:47.215
is in a police evidence lockup.

32:48.132 --> 32:52.721
And the money... that Domingo and
his crew were supposed to give you...

32:52.804 --> 32:54.180
is gone.

32:55.599 --> 32:58.435
I'm with Diamondback now.
You knew that, right?

32:59.102 --> 33:00.743
Well, tell
Diamondback, it's about time...

33:00.812 --> 33:03.482
Uh-uh... Diamondback tells you.

33:05.024 --> 33:07.151
[laughs]

33:07.235 --> 33:08.945
I'm his number one seller.

33:09.028 --> 33:10.655
I ain't here to spank you.

33:12.491 --> 33:14.951
But I do need to look
you in your eyes...

33:18.330 --> 33:19.664
Was it an inside job?

33:20.832 --> 33:22.166
No.

33:22.250 --> 33:24.002
Hell no.

33:24.085 --> 33:25.629
I needed that money, too.

33:25.712 --> 33:27.171
[sighs]

33:28.006 --> 33:30.299
It took forever to build
up that kind of trust.

33:30.384 --> 33:32.552
We're here to get you back on your feet.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.678
Whatever you need.

33:33.762 --> 33:36.556
Who is "we," you fake-ass Ray Charles?

33:37.974 --> 33:39.351
[chuckles]

33:43.021 --> 33:44.481
I got your back, B.

33:45.565 --> 33:47.108
Just like back in the day.

33:47.191 --> 33:49.277
Forget about back in the day.

33:51.070 --> 33:52.739
Why is this feeling like a takeover?

33:52.822 --> 33:54.240
[chuckling softly] It's not.

33:55.324 --> 33:57.285
If it was...

33:57.369 --> 33:59.913
you would never even
see Diamondback comin'.

33:59.996 --> 34:01.665
He wants you to win.

34:03.458 --> 34:05.001
How can I help?

34:14.342 --> 34:16.513
[indistinct chatter]

34:26.230 --> 34:30.444
[Pop] <i>Dante was one of
my kids. So was Chico.</i>

34:30.527 --> 34:32.404
And Shameek, too.

34:32.487 --> 34:35.072
Just like those kids playing over there.

34:35.156 --> 34:39.077
[scoffs] You know, that's
how you get 'em on your side.

34:39.159 --> 34:42.080
Sweepin' up hair. Runnin'
errands. [chuckling]

34:42.163 --> 34:47.001
Lettin' 'em hang out, play video games.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.797
Anything is better than what's waiting
for them out there on the street.

34:53.925 --> 34:55.427
They want a way out...

34:56.636 --> 35:01.558
but they have too much
pride to ask for help.

35:01.641 --> 35:05.562
So you gotta Jedi mind-trick
them into something. [chuckles]

35:05.645 --> 35:08.940
Everyone has a gun.
[sighs] No one has a father.

35:09.023 --> 35:11.150
Ain't that the truth.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.652
You sure they did it?

35:12.736 --> 35:16.740
People started callin' me half
an hour after it happened.

35:16.823 --> 35:20.702
Shameek has always been the spark plug.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.372
And Chico... a follower.

35:25.790 --> 35:29.544
I just can't believe that
either one of them...

35:29.628 --> 35:32.005
would just turn around...

35:33.339 --> 35:37.218
and kill... Dante.

35:39.763 --> 35:43.558
You didn't see anything going
on with either one of 'em, did you?

35:47.771 --> 35:49.063
No.

35:54.819 --> 35:57.446
You live and die by your choices.

35:57.531 --> 36:00.408
This is Harlem's garden. That's
what's happening here.

36:00.492 --> 36:03.703
You are the ones that are
gonna keep this community...

36:03.787 --> 36:05.622
[chuckles and gasps]

36:05.705 --> 36:08.625
Where have... Oh, God.
This is Marisol. Baby...

36:08.708 --> 36:11.503
Oh, my God, known her
since she was first born.

36:11.586 --> 36:14.422
And here you are
upturnin' Harlem around.

36:14.506 --> 36:15.924
I'm so proud of you.

36:16.007 --> 36:19.010
Ah! I saw you running
for the bus this mornin'.

36:20.011 --> 36:21.846
All right, darling.

36:24.974 --> 36:26.601
I'm happy you made it, darling.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.937
Uh-uh, uh-uh, cut him off at three.

36:29.020 --> 36:31.565
I know this young brother.
He'll eat five hamburgers.

36:31.648 --> 36:33.482
I've seen you do it.

36:38.697 --> 36:43.743
Now, Harlem is a community that
welcomes everyone. All people.

36:43.827 --> 36:46.162
But at the same time,

36:46.245 --> 36:48.665
since the days of Langston Hughes,

36:48.748 --> 36:53.127
Malcolm X, Zora Neale
Hurston, Duke Ellington,

36:53.211 --> 36:56.673
Harlem has been the
jewel of black America.

36:56.756 --> 37:02.554
It's a perpetual symbol of... of
hope and prosperity and excellence.

37:02.637 --> 37:04.222
For black lives to matter,

37:04.305 --> 37:07.642
black history and black
ownership must also matter.

37:07.726 --> 37:12.480
Now, my multifaceted plan for
the Crispus Attucks Complex

37:12.564 --> 37:15.775
is just yet another way to
bring hope to a new generation,

37:15.859 --> 37:19.613
to incubate the kind of
innovation and creativity

37:19.696 --> 37:22.448
and progress that Harlem's famous for.

37:23.617 --> 37:26.285
Thank you again for your
time, Madam Councilwoman.

37:26.369 --> 37:28.246
Oh, Megan, you're
always welcome in Harlem.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.664
- All right.
- All right, darling.

37:32.333 --> 37:34.711
Y'all need to fall the hell back.

37:34.794 --> 37:37.005
Zip, give her some space.

37:37.088 --> 37:38.965
I don't like the thugs.

37:39.048 --> 37:41.467
- You need them for security.
- Mmm, they scare people.

37:41.550 --> 37:44.721
They pass out flyers, get
contributions, tributes.

37:44.804 --> 37:47.390
[in Jamaican accent] Just
like in Jamaica, you know?

37:47.473 --> 37:51.102
- Yeah, well, we ain't Jamaican, Cornell.
- [chuckling]

37:51.185 --> 37:54.856
You shouldn't be here. We don't
need to be photographed together.

37:55.607 --> 37:56.900
Why?

37:57.525 --> 37:58.610
You ashamed of me?

38:01.029 --> 38:02.739
That hurts, Mariah.

38:02.822 --> 38:04.323
- Tony.
- Hmm?

38:04.407 --> 38:05.992
Will you give us a moment?

38:13.750 --> 38:15.794
I need the money you promised me ASAP.

38:15.877 --> 38:17.629
Now you want the money?

38:18.922 --> 38:22.050
I used federal grant and
tax-deductible donation money

38:22.133 --> 38:24.385
to complete construction on your club

38:24.468 --> 38:28.222
and to facilitate that meticulous
deal that just fell apart.

38:28.807 --> 38:31.976
I don't get the money,
I'm facing an audit.

38:32.060 --> 38:33.436
We all go to jail.

38:33.978 --> 38:35.647
It'll be there.

38:38.107 --> 38:41.152
What happened at the
junkyard last night?

38:41.235 --> 38:43.947
And who's the dude in
the sunglasses behind you?

38:44.989 --> 38:46.574
Is he after the money, too?

38:47.575 --> 38:50.161
Either you want the
details, cuz, or you don't.

38:54.708 --> 38:56.668
That's what I thought.

38:59.671 --> 39:00.714
What's the word?

39:00.797 --> 39:04.676
Confirmation of what Dante
told us while he was dying.

39:04.759 --> 39:07.053
His friends, the one that
play on your summer league team

39:07.136 --> 39:08.722
at the Rucker, jacked your shit.

39:09.638 --> 39:11.307
Shameek and Chico.

39:12.600 --> 39:13.601
Any bites yet?

39:15.979 --> 39:16.980
No.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.566
Double down.

39:22.110 --> 39:24.112
Twenty large to find those fools.

39:26.155 --> 39:28.157
[hip-hop music playing]

39:51.389 --> 39:53.933
Tone, Passion is
twerking for him right now.

39:54.017 --> 39:57.353
He ain't going nowhere soon. Not
with all that ass in his face.

39:58.687 --> 40:01.733
You want me to keep him
here, you need to pay me.

40:09.448 --> 40:12.994
Hey, yo, my man. You
know what time it is?

40:19.167 --> 40:20.168
8:15.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.253
[men laughing]

40:26.007 --> 40:27.926
Stay Harlem.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.971
Stay black.

40:41.522 --> 40:43.566
[playing jazz music]

41:30.363 --> 41:32.156
[cutlery clattering]

41:33.616 --> 41:35.118
- Hey, man.
- Watch your hands.

41:35.201 --> 41:36.202
You need to pay me.

41:36.285 --> 41:37.346
I'm paying you under the table,

41:37.370 --> 41:40.123
which means I'll pay you whenever
I goddamn feel like it.

41:44.878 --> 41:46.963
What you worried about?

41:47.659 --> 41:49.086
[Shameek] I'm not worried.

41:49.087 --> 41:50.775
I just never met Cottonmouth
before, that's all.

41:50.799 --> 41:52.844
[Tone] Mr. Stokes.

41:52.927 --> 41:56.764
Mr. Stokes. That's
important. Never Cottonmouth.

41:57.640 --> 41:58.933
All right, okay, my bad.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.561
After what happened with
Dante, we circling the wagons.

42:02.645 --> 42:04.355
They after us, B.

42:05.273 --> 42:06.858
Who?

42:06.941 --> 42:08.734
Nigga, it don't matter who.

42:09.903 --> 42:14.490
Mr. Stokes wanted me to
check on you... personally.

42:23.541 --> 42:25.668
[Tone] Yo, what you doin'? Come on.

42:56.657 --> 42:57.866
Shades.

43:11.797 --> 43:13.925
You like my Biggie photo?

43:15.718 --> 43:16.970
Me, too.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.515
You know what draws your
eye when you look at that?

43:23.184 --> 43:24.560
The crown.

43:26.938 --> 43:28.397
Wanna know why?

43:30.899 --> 43:31.985
Huh?

43:36.614 --> 43:38.950
'Cause everybody wants to be the king.

43:42.161 --> 43:44.330
- [grunts and sighs heavily]
- [Shameek groans]

43:45.873 --> 43:47.541
[chuckles]

43:49.793 --> 43:52.255
I slapped you like a little bitch.

43:52.338 --> 43:54.423
[breathes deeply]

43:54.507 --> 43:57.551
I'm not the kind of man to
use a closed fist on a woman.

43:59.595 --> 44:01.347
Where's my money?

44:02.890 --> 44:04.517
[Shameek] I... I didn't...

44:04.600 --> 44:05.893
Uh-uh.

44:08.396 --> 44:11.774
Only thing worse than
a thief is a damn liar.

44:13.317 --> 44:16.237
[grunting] Where's... my...

44:16.320 --> 44:17.738
- money?
- [Shameek groans]

44:17.821 --> 44:19.573
[Stokes breathing heavily] Hmm?

44:19.657 --> 44:20.783
[coughs]

44:21.950 --> 44:25.829
You left Dante alive. He called Tone.

44:25.913 --> 44:29.917
And with his dying words, gave
up you and your homeboy.

44:30.001 --> 44:31.669
We got your money.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.546
[breathing heavily]

44:33.629 --> 44:38.134
Now you're gonna tell us where
Chico is so we can get the rest.

44:41.179 --> 44:42.638
[spits]

44:43.931 --> 44:45.724
[laughing]

44:47.726 --> 44:50.188
Yeah. Thank you.

44:51.064 --> 44:53.732
Now I can hit you like a man.

44:53.816 --> 44:55.776
[mumbles] No...

44:55.859 --> 44:57.528
[grunting]

44:57.611 --> 44:59.113
[groans]

45:03.742 --> 45:06.329
[grunting and breathing heavily]

45:06.412 --> 45:07.913
[rapid punches landing]

45:12.085 --> 45:13.836
[punching continues]

45:19.300 --> 45:21.260
[bones crunching]

45:21.344 --> 45:23.053
[breathing heavily]

45:29.477 --> 45:31.104
[panting]

45:41.155 --> 45:42.823
Get his ass out of here.

45:42.906 --> 45:44.575
[breathing heavily]

45:45.493 --> 45:47.203
And go fetch my money.

45:54.335 --> 45:56.129
[breathing heavily]

46:03.219 --> 46:04.512
He didn't recognize you.

46:04.595 --> 46:05.888
[breathing heavily]

46:27.493 --> 46:29.578
[chain rattling faintly]

46:30.788 --> 46:32.581
[cell door buzzing faintly]

46:33.874 --> 46:39.004
Loneliness never goes away,
especially in places like Seagate.

46:39.087 --> 46:42.675
If you don't make
attempts to befriend someone...

46:43.884 --> 46:47.680
loneliness is guaranteed
to... eat you alive.

46:47.763 --> 46:51.725
- [cell door buzzing faintly]
- [men shouting indistinctly]

47:01.319 --> 47:02.861
[sighs]

47:11.036 --> 47:12.496
[exhales]

47:18.961 --> 47:20.629
I'm clear. [sighs]

47:22.172 --> 47:23.716
I'm focused.

47:25.468 --> 47:27.220
I promise, baby...

47:28.512 --> 47:29.722
I'm ready.

47:37.271 --> 47:38.772
[siren wails]

47:41.400 --> 47:44.111
- [female detective sighing]
- Shameek Smith...

47:44.194 --> 47:47.990
based on what they found in his pockets.
We'll need dental to confirm ID.

47:48.073 --> 47:50.075
[chuckles] His face is jacked.

47:50.158 --> 47:54.372
Mmm. They definitely dumped him
here. They got him somewhere else.

47:54.455 --> 47:57.333
Mmm. Looks like he got hit by a truck.

47:57.416 --> 47:58.667
Yeah.

47:59.543 --> 48:02.338
- A truck with two fists.
- [Scarfe chuckles]

48:02.421 --> 48:04.340
You know, Benjamin Franklin said,

48:04.423 --> 48:08.927
"The only way that three people can
keep a secret is if two of 'em are dead."

48:09.011 --> 48:12.806
First Dante, now Shameek. Chico's
the last man standing.

48:12.890 --> 48:14.475
Benjamin Franklin...

48:14.558 --> 48:17.645
Didn't he electrocute
himself flying a kite in a rainstorm?

48:17.728 --> 48:19.409
I wouldn't base any
theories on that fool.

48:19.438 --> 48:22.400
Benjamin Franklin is on
the $100 bill, Scarfe.

48:22.483 --> 48:25.068
[scoffs] So? He wasn't a president.

48:25.152 --> 48:28.822
That's even more impressive. Come
on, give the man some credit.

48:29.990 --> 48:33.201
Well... So you think
Chico did this to Shameek?

48:34.578 --> 48:38.541
Chico is what? A buck 50 soaking wet?

48:38.624 --> 48:41.043
But we won't know for
sure until we find him.

48:41.126 --> 48:44.588
You said Dante wasn't bartendin'
the night you were at the club.

48:44.672 --> 48:45.798
No.

48:45.881 --> 48:47.942
Well, did you talk to the
guy that replaced him that night?

48:47.966 --> 48:50.511
[scoffs] I barely talked to the guy.

48:50.594 --> 48:53.013
I mean... [inhales] all
I did was order drinks.

48:53.096 --> 48:56.183
Well, maybe there's some
pattern, somethin' we're missin'.

48:56.266 --> 48:58.226
We need to go talk to that guy.

48:58.311 --> 49:00.813
That sounds like a
complete waste of time.

49:01.939 --> 49:03.566
That's entirely possible.

49:03.649 --> 49:06.234
But it's worth a shot.

49:06.319 --> 49:08.278
[scoffs] All right.

49:43.356 --> 49:45.899
You've been in this
country for how long?

49:45.983 --> 49:50.404
And you still... can't speak English?

49:50.488 --> 49:52.990
My English is just fine.

49:53.073 --> 49:54.950
Show Mariah Dillard some love.

49:55.033 --> 49:58.120
Contribute and we'll go away.

49:58.203 --> 49:59.329
It's a family thing.

49:59.413 --> 50:01.457
I own this restaurant.

50:01.540 --> 50:03.959
My father owned this building.

50:04.042 --> 50:08.296
Tell Mariah Dillard I am
not contributing to her complex.

50:08.381 --> 50:11.592
We voted for her and
gave her money before.

50:11.675 --> 50:14.387
And I respect Mr. Stokes.

50:14.470 --> 50:17.222
But no. No more.

50:17.305 --> 50:18.641
- I can't.
- [bat strikes]

50:19.975 --> 50:23.812
Give us... the money.

Excuse me?

Not the way I want to. I'd kill you.
