01:30.540 --> 01:33.612
I'll knock your block off, you big stiff!
You're a bum!

01:43.500 --> 01:44.979
Strike! You're out!

02:08.900 --> 02:09.889
Elmer, here it is.

02:10.500 --> 02:13.492
- I knew you'd find it.
- Boy, I could sure use a drink.

02:15.700 --> 02:18.294
I wonder if any big shots
are getting married today?

02:20.820 --> 02:23.618
Looks like the same suckers
get married every day.

02:23.780 --> 02:24.769
Come on.

02:25.140 --> 02:27.210
Hey, the guy with the cheaters.

02:33.220 --> 02:34.938
Now what's he hiding from?

02:39.700 --> 02:43.773
- Hey, isn't that Mortimer Brewster?
- Mortimer Brewster, the dramatic critic?

02:45.940 --> 02:48.534
No, it's not him. But what a scoop it'd be!

02:48.660 --> 02:53.051
The guy who wrote The Bachelor's Bible
getting hooked. It's too good to be true.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.495
Let's snap the mayor
in his new fire helmet and go.

02:55.580 --> 02:57.536
Let's stick around, see who the guy is.

02:57.620 --> 03:00.180
"Two by two they come and go"

03:00.620 --> 03:02.531
Good morning, children.
Your name, please?

03:02.620 --> 03:04.531
- Elaine Harper.
- Speak a little louder.

03:04.620 --> 03:05.814
Elaine Harper.

03:06.220 --> 03:07.733
Thank you. Yours?

03:10.460 --> 03:12.416
- Mortimer Brewster.
- How's that?

03:14.020 --> 03:15.419
Mortimer Brewster.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.253
Speak up, sonny.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

03:24.660 --> 03:26.298
I want to keep this undercover.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.577
Love her? Of course you love her.
You're marrying her, right?

03:29.660 --> 03:31.412
You don't understand. Come here.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.536
I don't want this to get out for a while.

03:33.620 --> 03:35.338
I'm Mortimer Brewster.

03:35.860 --> 03:36.975
You're who?

03:37.260 --> 03:38.454
Mortimer Brew...

03:42.300 --> 03:43.415
That's him!

03:44.660 --> 03:45.854
Mr. Brewster!

03:53.540 --> 03:54.973
Now, look...

03:55.860 --> 03:57.088
Goodbye, dear.

04:02.100 --> 04:03.977
Don't you understand?
How can I marry you?

04:04.100 --> 04:07.251
Me, the symbol of bachelorhood.
I've sneered at every love scene.

04:07.660 --> 04:09.890
I've written four million words
against marriage!

04:09.980 --> 04:14.019
Not only hooked, but to a minister's
daughter, and a girl from Brooklyn.

04:14.100 --> 04:17.375
Look at the way you look!
What is that contraption you've got there?

04:17.700 --> 04:21.375
A pin I borrowed from your aunts.
You know, "Something borrowed... "

04:21.459 --> 04:24.293
I know, "Something borrowed,
something blue". Old, new.

04:24.380 --> 04:26.814
Rice and old shoes.
Carry you over the threshold.

04:26.900 --> 04:29.892
Niagara Falls. All that silly tripe.
Is this what I've come to?

04:29.980 --> 04:32.699
I can't go through with it.
I won't marry you. That's that.

04:32.780 --> 04:35.613
- Yes, Mortimer.
- What do you mean, "Yes, Mortimer"?

04:35.900 --> 04:38.095
Aren't you insulted?
Aren't you going to cry?

04:38.180 --> 04:41.058
- No, Mortimer.
- And don't "No, Mortimer" me, either!

04:41.180 --> 04:43.011
Marriage is a superstition.

04:43.220 --> 04:45.097
It's old-fashioned. It's...

05:28.700 --> 05:31.168
O'Hara, don't be a jerk. You don't realize...

05:31.260 --> 05:34.172
...I'm turning over to you
the nicest, best beat in Brooklyn.

05:34.260 --> 05:37.058
Now look at that old church.
And them old houses.

05:37.780 --> 05:39.736
Did George Washington ever sleep here?

05:39.820 --> 05:43.449
Of course he did. This whole neighborhood
just stinks with atmosphere.

05:43.980 --> 05:46.972
- And look at that old house.
- The original owners still there?

05:47.060 --> 05:49.369
Don't crack wise
about the Brewster sisters.

05:49.460 --> 05:53.499
They're two of the dearest, sweetest
old ladies that ever walked the earth.

05:53.580 --> 05:55.332
They're out of this world.

05:56.060 --> 05:59.291
They're like pressed rose leaves.

05:59.580 --> 06:00.854
Pressed rose leaves?

06:02.340 --> 06:04.251
The old girls must be kind of hard up.

06:05.060 --> 06:07.176
Their old man left them fixed for life.

06:07.260 --> 06:09.330
Don't you call them "the girls," either.

06:09.420 --> 06:11.012
Brophy. Is Lieutenant around?

06:11.100 --> 06:12.897
So what are they renting rooms for?

06:12.980 --> 06:16.097
They don't. But you can bet
if anybody came looking for a room...

06:16.180 --> 06:19.377
...they wouldn't go away
without a good meal and a couple of bucks.

06:20.620 --> 06:23.088
That's their way of digging up people
to do good to.

06:30.660 --> 06:33.857
Reverend Harper, I do hope
you don't disapprove of Mortimer...

06:33.940 --> 06:38.172
...because he's a dramatic critic
and takes your daughter to the theater.

06:38.460 --> 06:41.020
It's not that I disapprove
of his being a critic...

06:41.100 --> 06:44.456
...but no man with this published attitude...

06:46.380 --> 06:49.452
...should take any man's daughter
anyplace, at any time.

06:52.060 --> 06:53.698
I must be catching cold.

06:53.940 --> 06:56.738
No, dear. It was Reverend Harper
who sneezed. Bless you.

06:58.300 --> 07:00.370
We mustn't be angry with Mortimer.

07:00.460 --> 07:04.453
He's so very much in love with her.
Sister Martha and I are so happy.

07:04.740 --> 07:07.777
He used to come to see us
only occasionally, and now...

07:07.940 --> 07:10.170
...he's in Brooklyn six nights a week.

07:11.580 --> 07:13.696
Remember now, watch your language.

07:13.940 --> 07:15.737
You know I'm not a swearing man.

07:15.820 --> 07:18.573
You'd be surprised
what they'd consider swearing.

07:20.860 --> 07:24.569
Will you excuse me?
No, no, Teddy, dear. Thank you. I'll go.

07:27.220 --> 07:30.895
- Come right in, Mr. Brophy.
- Miss Abby, we came for the toys.

07:31.020 --> 07:33.614
This is Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my beat.

07:33.700 --> 07:36.658
- How do you do, miss?
- Welcome to our neighborhood.

07:36.740 --> 07:38.890
Gentlemen, what news
have you brought me?

07:39.180 --> 07:41.296
Colonel, we have nothing to report.

07:43.780 --> 07:46.010
No, absolutely nothing to report.

07:46.820 --> 07:48.094
Splendid!

07:48.300 --> 07:50.416
Thank you, gentlemen. At ease.

07:51.740 --> 07:54.812
You know the Reverend Dr. Harper
from the church next door?

07:54.900 --> 07:58.210
Hello. This is Officer O'Hara,
the new man on the beat.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.814
How do you do, sir? It's nice to meet you.

08:03.940 --> 08:07.728
The toys are on the chair up here,
by the library door.

08:10.940 --> 08:15.536
Teddy, run upstairs and bring down your
Army and Navy from Aunt Martha's room.

08:15.620 --> 08:17.019
They're all packed.

08:18.660 --> 08:23.176
That's splendid work you men do, fixing up
discarded toys for the kids at camp.

08:23.380 --> 08:24.335
Charge!

08:33.299 --> 08:36.975
It gives us something to do at the station.
You get tired of playing cards.

08:44.020 --> 08:46.853
- So these are the toys?
- How's Mrs. Brophy?

08:46.940 --> 08:49.659
She's better, thank you.
But a little weak, still.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.379
I'll get some beef broth
for you to take to her.

08:52.460 --> 08:55.179
Please don't bother.
You've done so much already.

08:55.300 --> 08:57.689
Stop the nonsense! I won't be a minute.

09:02.740 --> 09:07.291
Gentlemen, if I know what pure kindness
and absolute generosity are...

09:07.540 --> 09:10.259
...it's because I've known
the Brewster sisters.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.574
Teddy, you promised me
you wouldn't do that anymore.

09:17.660 --> 09:20.652
But I have to call a Cabinet meeting
to get those supplies.

09:20.740 --> 09:23.174
Now don't do that again. Do you hear me?

09:27.380 --> 09:28.813
He used to do that at night...

09:28.900 --> 09:31.539
...and the neighbors raised Cain.
They're afraid of him.

09:31.620 --> 09:35.010
Look, Sarge, I promised I wouldn't swear,
but what the heck...

09:35.660 --> 09:36.934
What's going on here?

09:37.020 --> 09:39.614
- He's quite harmless.
- He thinks he's Teddy Roosevelt.

09:39.700 --> 09:42.498
There's a lot of worse guys
he could think he was.

09:44.820 --> 09:46.014
That's right.

09:46.140 --> 09:48.495
I'll make a note.
He's an interesting character.

09:48.580 --> 09:50.298
Isn't it a shame, Father...

09:50.780 --> 09:54.819
Isn't it a shame, Reverend, that this nice
family should be hatching a cuckoo?

09:56.180 --> 09:58.614
Well, now, isn't this nice!

09:58.700 --> 10:01.214
- Good afternoon, Miss Brewster.
- How do you do?

10:01.300 --> 10:03.973
- Good afternoon.
- Reverend, how do you do?

10:04.100 --> 10:06.739
Miss Martha, Officer O'Hara.
He's taking over my duties.

10:06.820 --> 10:07.935
How do you do?

10:08.020 --> 10:10.250
- I'm very glad to know you.
- Thank you.

10:11.420 --> 10:12.853
Martha, you're back.

10:12.940 --> 10:15.977
Here's the broth for Mrs. Brophy.
Be sure it's good and hot.

10:16.060 --> 10:18.369
You bet I will, and thank you very much.

10:18.460 --> 10:20.769
The Army and Navy are ready for action.

10:20.980 --> 10:23.813
Colonel, this is grand.
It'll make a lot of kids happy.

10:23.900 --> 10:25.811
What's this? The Oregon?

10:26.060 --> 10:27.891
Teddy, dear, put it back.

10:28.140 --> 10:30.700
- But the Oregon goes to Australia.
- Now, Teddy...

10:30.780 --> 10:32.532
No, it goes to Australia.

10:32.700 --> 10:35.692
- These are lovely. Thank you.
- Not at all.

10:38.180 --> 10:40.978
- The children will go crazy.
- Don't mention it.

10:41.220 --> 10:42.573
So long, Colonel.

10:43.780 --> 10:44.974
Hey, Sarge.

10:45.420 --> 10:46.614
Yes.

10:48.380 --> 10:49.449
Dismissed!

10:50.580 --> 10:53.048
- Goodbye and thank you.
- Don't mention it.

10:53.220 --> 10:55.939
- Careful of the step with the toys.
- Good night.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.409
Young man, let that be a lesson to you.

11:06.500 --> 11:07.979
Goodbye.

11:11.620 --> 11:13.611
- Well, I must be going.
- Charge!

11:15.420 --> 11:17.138
Charge the blockhouse!

11:23.740 --> 11:24.889
Blockhouse?

11:25.860 --> 11:28.135
The stairs are always San Juan Hill.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.249
Bless you!

11:30.460 --> 11:32.769
Have you tried to persuade him
he wasn't Roosevelt?

11:32.860 --> 11:36.057
- Oh, no!
- He's so happy being Teddy Roosevelt.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.536
Do you remember, Martha?

11:38.740 --> 11:42.130
Once, a long time ago,
we thought if he'd be George Washington...

11:42.220 --> 11:44.939
...it might be a change for him,
and we suggested it.

11:45.220 --> 11:47.051
And do you know what happened?

11:47.140 --> 11:50.530
He just stayed under his bed for days
and wouldn't be anybody.

11:51.420 --> 11:54.890
Well, if he's happy, and what's
more important, you're happy...

11:55.020 --> 11:57.580
Our only worry for Teddy
is after we're gone.

11:57.780 --> 12:00.010
Yes, indeed. That is quite a problem.

12:00.100 --> 12:02.568
Mortimer's made all the arrangements
for Teddy...

12:02.660 --> 12:05.697
...to go to Happy Dale Sanitarium
after we pass on.

12:05.780 --> 12:08.169
Splendid idea! A very pleasant place.

12:12.700 --> 12:14.531
Dear, sweet Reverend Harper.

12:17.100 --> 12:20.490
You know, Martha,
I do believe he's beginning to see the light.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.411
I'm sure we needn't worry about him.

12:22.500 --> 12:25.697
He won't interfere with our plans
for Mortimer and Elaine.

12:26.660 --> 12:28.412
Did you just have tea?

12:28.580 --> 12:29.456
Yes.

12:30.300 --> 12:32.939
And dinner's going to be late, too.

12:33.580 --> 12:35.298
So, why?

12:39.260 --> 12:41.012
Good news for you.

12:41.100 --> 12:44.649
You're going to Panama
and dig another lock for the canal.

12:45.100 --> 12:46.852
Delighted!

12:47.100 --> 12:49.011
That's bully! Just bully!

12:49.260 --> 12:51.649
I shall prepare at once for the journey.

12:53.780 --> 12:54.735
Charge!

13:00.780 --> 13:02.816
Abby! While I was out?

13:02.900 --> 13:05.334
Yes, dear. I just couldn't wait for you.

13:05.500 --> 13:08.651
I didn't know when you'd be back,
and Reverend Harper was coming.

13:08.740 --> 13:11.777
- But all by yourself.
- I got along fine.

13:11.940 --> 13:14.500
- I'll run right downstairs and see.
- No, dear.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.697
There wasn't time. And I was all alone.

13:20.780 --> 13:21.690
Well?

13:24.420 --> 13:26.934
Just look in the windowseat.

13:38.860 --> 13:40.976
- It's Elaine!
- Hello, darlings.

13:43.780 --> 13:45.771
- But, Elaine!
- What did she mean?

13:45.980 --> 13:48.130
You don't suppose they've gone and...

13:52.820 --> 13:53.775
Listen, buddy.

13:53.860 --> 13:57.330
- This old cab has seen osculation but...
- You ain't seen anything yet.

13:57.420 --> 14:00.014
- You've got to drive us to the station.
- Take her hat.

14:00.460 --> 14:02.690
Wait a minute. And her brooch.

14:02.820 --> 14:05.573
If you find her hairpins, keep them.
Hold on to that.

14:09.620 --> 14:10.848
There they are.

14:11.420 --> 14:12.694
Here's your hat.

14:13.540 --> 14:16.008
Just throw it.
I don't like that look in your eyes.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.934
- What's the matter with it?
- Father preached about it only last Sunday.

14:20.380 --> 14:22.052
He did? What did he say?

14:22.180 --> 14:24.819
- He was against it.
- But that was only Sunday.

14:28.460 --> 14:30.291
Please! For heaven's sake!

14:30.460 --> 14:33.054
But, Mortimer, right out here
with everyone looking?

14:33.140 --> 14:35.608
Yes, right out here with everyone looking.

14:35.700 --> 14:37.975
Let everyone in Brooklyn over 16 look.

14:47.540 --> 14:50.612
But, Mortimer, you're going to love me
for my mind, too?

14:50.740 --> 14:52.298
One thing at a time.

14:52.380 --> 14:54.018
There's that look again!

14:56.060 --> 14:59.177
"There's that look again, Mortimer! "
You better get used to it.

14:59.260 --> 15:01.979
You'll see it often. It goes just before this.

15:03.780 --> 15:05.896
You know what we're doing?
Wasting time.

15:05.980 --> 15:08.016
I'll go tell my aunts and you tell your...

15:08.100 --> 15:11.456
No, don't tell your father.
You'll run his cold into a pneumonia.

15:11.580 --> 15:13.616
I can handle Father. He's a dear.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.498
Look, why don't we wire him
from Niagara Falls?

15:16.900 --> 15:18.299
Niagara Falls?

15:18.900 --> 15:20.856
That's why you stopped at your office.

15:20.940 --> 15:23.329
Yes, certainly!
We're going to go the whole hog.

15:23.420 --> 15:25.854
Niagara Falls!
Everybody ought to go there.

15:26.060 --> 15:28.449
You should've seen my secretary's face.

15:28.540 --> 15:31.418
We've a room on the train,
the bridal suite in the hotel...

15:31.500 --> 15:34.253
...and tomorrow morning
we go over the falls in a barrel.

15:35.420 --> 15:37.138
Go on, darling, hurry and pack.

15:37.220 --> 15:39.973
I don't have to.
I started packing the day after I met you.

15:40.060 --> 15:41.857
There, you see! You see?

15:41.980 --> 15:44.858
That's what I mean.
That's what I hate about women.

15:48.260 --> 15:50.296
I wonder what Mary's doing now?

15:54.900 --> 15:57.892
- The train leaves in an hour, hurry.
- It'll be a few minutes.

15:57.980 --> 16:00.938
- Father may want to pray over me.
- Whistle when you're ready.

16:01.860 --> 16:03.771
When you whistle, open the front door fast.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.216
If you see a tall, dark streak of light,
it's me.

16:12.900 --> 16:13.855
What? Now?

16:13.940 --> 16:15.089
No, not now!

16:16.260 --> 16:18.251
Look surprised when he tells us.

16:20.900 --> 16:22.219
Hold on to your bustles.

16:22.300 --> 16:24.689
We're married. Elaine and I are married.

16:24.780 --> 16:26.452
Oh, darling, how wonderful!

16:26.540 --> 16:28.610
Isn't it wonderful? They're married!

16:28.700 --> 16:32.170
Don't pretend to be so surprised either,
you two old frauds.

16:32.900 --> 16:34.936
- Can I use the telephone?
- Of course.

16:35.020 --> 16:37.534
Isn't it too, too wonderful?

16:37.620 --> 16:40.612
And to think that it happened
right here in this room!

16:40.780 --> 16:42.008
Now, here.

16:43.140 --> 16:45.370
Benson's Florists?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

16:45.460 --> 16:48.133
Did you send those roses
to Mrs. Brewster? Good.

16:48.220 --> 16:51.530
Send four dozen more to drawing room A,
Grand Central Station.

16:51.620 --> 16:54.418
Hurry. And throw in a flock
of orange blossoms.

16:54.540 --> 16:56.974
But before you go,
we can have our celebration.

16:57.060 --> 16:59.210
I'll open a bottle of wine and we'll sing.

16:59.300 --> 17:01.052
And we'll invite a few neighbors in.

17:01.140 --> 17:04.689
- And, of course, a wedding cake.
- You won't have time to bake a cake.

17:04.819 --> 17:07.015
We're going to Niagara Falls.
A taxi's waiting.

17:07.099 --> 17:09.409
It's all ready. It's been ready since...

17:09.500 --> 17:11.968
I bet it's been ready
since the first day I met her.

17:12.060 --> 17:14.619
Did everybody know
I was getting married, except me?

17:14.700 --> 17:17.214
We knew you'd find out about it in time.

17:18.980 --> 17:21.210
I've got the two nicest aunts in the world.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.973
Of course, you've got
the nicest nephew in the world, too.

17:24.420 --> 17:26.980
Well, I'll run along
and get everything ready.

17:27.700 --> 17:30.498
Oh, dear. I do hope the Reverend
isn't too angry.

17:30.580 --> 17:32.298
You know how your books upset him.

17:32.380 --> 17:36.168
I'm going to burn all my books.
I'll let the Reverend light the first match.

17:36.620 --> 17:38.770
Did I leave some notes here
for my new book?

17:38.860 --> 17:40.816
You mean Mind Over Matrimony

17:41.460 --> 17:42.449
Where are they?

17:42.540 --> 17:44.895
- I hid them someplace...
- Come along.

17:44.980 --> 17:45.935
Now you behave.

17:46.020 --> 17:48.409
Let's find them before Elaine sees them.

17:52.900 --> 17:54.856
Hello, Mortimer!

17:55.980 --> 17:59.290
- How are you, Mr. President?
- Bully, thank you. Just bully.

17:59.420 --> 18:02.810
- What news have you brought me?
- The country's squarely behind you.

18:02.900 --> 18:04.936
Yes, I know. Isn't it wonderful?

18:05.220 --> 18:08.018
Well, goodbye. I'm off to Panama.

18:08.460 --> 18:10.098
Goodbye, Mr. President.

18:10.220 --> 18:12.336
A new lock for the canal, you know.

18:12.740 --> 18:14.890
"Oh, tell the news to Mother"

18:16.420 --> 18:18.980
- Oh, dear.
- Find those notes? What's wrong?

18:19.100 --> 18:21.819
There's a baby picture
of your brother Jonathan.

18:23.380 --> 18:26.611
You ought to put that in the fire
with my books. My, what a face!

18:27.020 --> 18:29.215
I remember now.
He'd scare grownups with it.

18:29.300 --> 18:31.575
Just the thought of Jonathan frightens me.

18:31.660 --> 18:35.130
Do you remember how he used to cut
worms in two with his teeth?

18:36.500 --> 18:40.015
Jonathan? He's probably in prison
or hanged or something by now.

18:40.300 --> 18:43.531
I saw a play, had a character in it,
reminded me of Jonathan.

18:43.620 --> 18:44.575
Really?

18:45.180 --> 18:49.059
A honey of a lunatic. One of those
whodunits called Murder Will Out.

18:49.300 --> 18:50.176
Oh, dear!

18:50.260 --> 18:51.693
Yeah, what a play.

18:53.300 --> 18:56.849
When the curtain goes up,
the first thing you see is a dead body.

18:57.220 --> 18:58.539
The next thing...

19:09.820 --> 19:10.969
Hey, mister.

19:41.260 --> 19:44.969
- Happy bridegroom!
- Congratulations, darling!

19:46.780 --> 19:48.736
Never mind that now.

19:49.020 --> 19:50.578
Now, listen, darlings.

19:52.860 --> 19:56.250
You know how we've always planned
to send Teddy to Happy Dale?

19:56.340 --> 19:58.729
Yes, dear. That's after we're gone.

19:58.900 --> 20:01.653
Yes, we talked with Reverend Harper
about it.

20:03.220 --> 20:05.495
Teddy's got to go to Happy Dale now.
At once!

20:05.580 --> 20:09.459
- He's in the cellar. Get him up here now.
- There's no such hurry as that.

20:09.740 --> 20:13.494
When Teddy's working on the canal,
you can't get his mind on anything else.

20:14.220 --> 20:15.733
Well, look, darlings.

20:15.900 --> 20:18.892
I'm frightfully sorry,
but I've got an awful shock for you.

20:19.380 --> 20:21.336
Teddy's killed a man, darlings!

20:22.260 --> 20:23.329
Nonsense!

20:23.460 --> 20:25.371
There's a body in the windowseat!

20:25.460 --> 20:27.690
Yes, dear. We know.

20:30.820 --> 20:32.890
- You know?
- Of course.

20:33.100 --> 20:35.534
Yes, but it has nothing to do with Teddy.

20:36.540 --> 20:39.213
Now, Mortimer. You just forget about it.

20:39.380 --> 20:41.450
Forget you ever saw the gentleman.

20:42.140 --> 20:43.050
Forget?

20:43.140 --> 20:45.415
We never dreamed you'd peek.

20:46.140 --> 20:47.334
What the...

20:48.420 --> 20:49.489
Who is he?

20:49.700 --> 20:52.612
He's a Mr. Hoskins. Adam Hoskins.

20:53.340 --> 20:56.810
That's really all I know about him,
except that he's a Methodist.

20:56.980 --> 20:59.175
He's a Methodist? Isn't that nice.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.535
That's all you know?
What's he doing here?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.611
- What happened to him?
- He died.

21:04.100 --> 21:07.217
Aunt Martha, men just don't get
into windowseats and die.

21:07.420 --> 21:10.093
No, dear. He died first.

21:10.460 --> 21:12.018
Wait! Stop all this.

21:13.340 --> 21:15.058
Now look, how did he die?

21:15.180 --> 21:17.740
Mortimer, don't be so inquisitive.

21:18.300 --> 21:22.930
The gentleman died because he drank
some wine with poison in it.

21:24.980 --> 21:27.096
How did the poison get in the wine?

21:27.180 --> 21:29.614
We put it in wine
because it's less noticeable.

21:29.700 --> 21:32.134
When it's in tea, it has a distinct odor.

21:33.300 --> 21:34.494
You mean you...

21:35.540 --> 21:36.939
You put it in the wine?

21:37.020 --> 21:40.376
Yes. And I put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat...

21:40.460 --> 21:42.735
...because Reverend Harper was coming.

21:45.700 --> 21:47.258
Look at me, darling.

21:49.180 --> 21:52.775
You knew what you'd done and didn't want
Reverend Harper to see the body?

21:52.860 --> 21:55.932
Well, not at tea.
That wouldn't have been very nice.

21:58.620 --> 22:00.019
It's first-degree.

22:00.100 --> 22:03.649
Now, Mortimer, you know all about it
and just forget about it.

22:04.020 --> 22:07.899
I do think that Martha and I have the right
to our own little secrets.

22:11.460 --> 22:14.975
Abby, while I was out I dropped in
on Mrs. Schultz. She's much better.

22:15.060 --> 22:17.415
But she wants us to take Junior
to the movies again.

22:17.500 --> 22:19.616
We must do that, tomorrow or next day.

22:19.700 --> 22:22.658
Yes, but this time we'll go
where we want to go.

22:22.900 --> 22:26.939
Junior's not going to drag me
into another one of those scary pictures.

22:27.500 --> 22:31.459
They ought not to be allowed
to make pictures just to frighten people.

22:50.620 --> 22:51.735
Operator?

22:52.140 --> 22:53.971
Can you hear my voice?

22:54.860 --> 22:55.929
You can?

22:56.380 --> 22:57.574
Are you sure?

22:58.700 --> 22:59.974
Then I must be here.

23:26.860 --> 23:29.818
The dears. Isn't Halloween
a wonderful time for them?

23:29.900 --> 23:32.494
Yes, it is. They have so much fun.

23:33.980 --> 23:36.255
Now, Mortimer, don't be so impatient.

23:36.380 --> 23:38.735
- We'll let you lick the bowl.
- Lick the bowl?

23:38.820 --> 23:41.288
I don't want to.
I want to know what we're going to do!

23:41.380 --> 23:43.018
We're going to celebrate.

23:43.140 --> 23:45.859
Celebrate? There's a body
in the windowseat!

23:45.940 --> 23:47.737
Yes, dear. Mr. Hoskins.

23:48.060 --> 23:51.097
I know what his name is. I want to know
what we're going to do.

23:51.180 --> 23:54.172
- We can't turn you over to the police.
- Stop worrying about it.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.371
We told you to forget the whole thing.

23:56.460 --> 24:00.692
Forget? Can't I make you realize
that something has to be done?

24:00.780 --> 24:02.611
Now, Mortimer, you behave.

24:02.820 --> 24:05.732
You're too old
to be flying off the handle like this.

24:06.500 --> 24:08.775
- But Mr. Hodgekiss...
- Hoskins, dear.

24:08.860 --> 24:11.328
Whatever his name is,
you can't leave him in there.

24:11.420 --> 24:12.933
We don't intend to, dear.

24:13.020 --> 24:16.057
Teddy's down in the cellar now,
digging the lock.

24:21.740 --> 24:24.095
You're going to bury
Mr. Hodgekiss in the cellar?

24:24.180 --> 24:26.774
Yes, dear.
That's what we did with the others.

24:27.740 --> 24:29.970
Look, here, Aunt Martha. You can't...

24:30.740 --> 24:33.413
- Others?
- The other gentlemen.

24:35.060 --> 24:37.574
When you say "others,"
do you mean "others"?

24:38.060 --> 24:40.494
- More than one "others"?
- Yes, dear.

24:40.700 --> 24:43.612
Let me see now. This is 11, isn't it, Abby?

24:43.820 --> 24:45.890
No, dear. This makes 12.

24:46.140 --> 24:49.849
Abby, dear, I think you're wrong.
This one is only 11.

24:50.140 --> 24:53.530
No, dear, because I remember
when Mr. Hoskins first came in...

24:53.620 --> 24:56.657
...it occurred to me
that he'd make just an even dozen.

24:58.340 --> 25:02.379
But, Abby, dear, I really don't think
you should count the first one.

25:02.580 --> 25:05.617
I was counting the first one,
and that makes it 12.

25:06.020 --> 25:07.009
It does?

25:08.540 --> 25:11.612
Well, she's probably right. Abby usually is.

25:11.700 --> 25:13.691
I get them mixed up sometimes.

25:14.100 --> 25:15.249
Makes it 12.

25:22.260 --> 25:23.249
Hello.

25:26.460 --> 25:29.179
Whatever is the matter
with Mortimer today?

25:29.260 --> 25:31.137
Why, Abby,
what do you think happened to him?

25:32.260 --> 25:32.976
Hello?

25:39.140 --> 25:41.973
Not now. For heaven's sake,
keep your shirt on!

25:44.220 --> 25:45.858
Elaine, I didn't mean...

25:49.460 --> 25:51.291
Now, let's see. Where were we?

25:51.380 --> 25:52.699
Twelve. Twelve!

25:53.140 --> 25:54.129
Yes, dear.

25:54.220 --> 25:56.859
Abby thinks we should count the first one.

25:57.020 --> 25:59.215
Never mind about that. Just sit down.

25:59.300 --> 26:01.256
Tell me, who was the first one?

26:01.420 --> 26:04.014
Mr. Midgely. He was a Baptist.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.330
He was such a lonely, old gentleman.

26:06.900 --> 26:08.970
All his kith and kin were dead.

26:09.060 --> 26:11.016
We felt so sorry for him.

26:11.260 --> 26:14.172
And then, when his heart attack came...

26:14.260 --> 26:17.536
...and he sat there dead in that chair...

26:17.940 --> 26:21.410
...looking so peaceful.
Remember, Martha?

26:22.340 --> 26:24.729
We made up our minds, then and there...

26:24.900 --> 26:27.778
...that if we could help
other lonely, old men...

26:27.980 --> 26:30.050
...to find that same peace...

26:30.300 --> 26:31.449
...we would.

26:32.540 --> 26:33.768
Why, you poor...

26:33.980 --> 26:36.619
You mean, he dropped dead
right in this chair?

26:39.540 --> 26:42.771
And then, you see,
Teddy came up from digging in Panama...

26:42.900 --> 26:46.097
...and he thought Mr. Midgely
was a yellow-fever victim.

26:46.340 --> 26:49.298
And that meant
he had to be buried immediately.

26:49.700 --> 26:52.612
So, we all took him down to Panama...

26:52.740 --> 26:56.619
...and put him in the lock
and gave him a decent Christian burial.

26:56.940 --> 27:01.252
There, now you see? That's why
we told you not to bother about it...

27:01.340 --> 27:04.093
...because we know exactly
what's to be done.

27:07.140 --> 27:08.334
Wait a minute!

27:08.580 --> 27:11.014
Come here, darling.
What about the others?

27:11.460 --> 27:13.849
All 12 of them didn't walk in here
and drop dead.

27:14.220 --> 27:15.858
No, dear. Of course not!

27:15.940 --> 27:17.089
Well, so...

27:24.700 --> 27:26.019
- Mortimer.
- What?

27:26.260 --> 27:29.058
Do you remember those jars of poison
on the shelves...

27:29.140 --> 27:31.415
...in Grandfather's laboratory
all these years?

27:31.500 --> 27:34.298
You know your Aunt Martha's knack
for mixing things.

27:34.380 --> 27:36.689
You've eaten enough of her piccalilli.

27:37.100 --> 27:40.297
Well, dear, for a gallon of elderberry wine...

27:40.380 --> 27:42.974
...I take one teaspoonful of arsenic...

27:43.060 --> 27:45.369
...then add half a teaspoonful of strychnine.

27:45.460 --> 27:49.089
And then, just a pinch of cyanide.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.772
Should have quite a kick.

27:54.660 --> 27:57.857
As a matter of fact,
one of our gentlemen found time to say:.

27:57.940 --> 27:59.134
"How delicious! "

27:59.220 --> 28:01.529
He did? Well, wasn't that nice of him?

28:01.660 --> 28:04.618
Abby, we mustn't be standing here
gossiping all night.

28:04.700 --> 28:06.213
We must get that cake frosted.

28:06.300 --> 28:09.178
Don't worry about the cake.
I couldn't eat a thing.

28:09.460 --> 28:13.248
You newlyweds! A sip of wine
will give you an appetite.

28:13.340 --> 28:16.173
That'd be nice, darling, a sip of...
A sip of wine!

28:16.540 --> 28:17.529
Wine!

28:37.140 --> 28:39.700
I'm beginning to think the cat's in on this.

28:41.300 --> 28:45.339
He's wonderful. Happy as a lark.
Singing away, digging locks.

28:45.420 --> 28:47.854
Got him working on a yellow-fever victim.

28:48.420 --> 28:50.092
I can see the headlines now:.

28:50.180 --> 28:53.490
"Murder Incorporator Rides Again"
right across the front page.

28:54.220 --> 28:55.448
Let me see...

28:56.100 --> 28:58.819
Teddy! Of course.
Everybody knows he's crazy.

28:59.380 --> 29:02.611
Let me see. Who can I call up?
Dewey, La Guardia, Winchell?

29:02.700 --> 29:04.338
No, Winchell's no good.

29:05.100 --> 29:06.374
Old Judge Cullman!

29:06.460 --> 29:08.337
I wonder if I got his number.

29:09.220 --> 29:11.097
What am I doing with tickets?

29:11.300 --> 29:12.449
Information.

29:18.100 --> 29:19.135
Information?

29:19.220 --> 29:22.690
Get me the number of Judge Cullman
on North Shore Road, Brooklyn.

29:22.780 --> 29:24.054
Yeah, would you call me back?

29:27.660 --> 29:29.730
Wouldn't it be marvelous
if he wasn't there?

29:31.260 --> 29:32.534
Hey, you!

29:34.020 --> 29:36.454
Thought you were tall, dark streak of light.

29:36.740 --> 29:38.253
What are you doing here?

29:38.380 --> 29:41.053
What am I doing here?
Didn't you hear me whistle?

29:41.140 --> 29:42.539
Whistle? Oh, yes.

29:42.860 --> 29:44.339
I heard you whistle.

29:45.020 --> 29:46.612
- How do I look?
- You look fine.

29:46.700 --> 29:49.089
- Run on home. I'll call you up tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

29:49.180 --> 29:51.978
You know I always call you up
every day or two.

29:52.060 --> 29:55.496
You and your gags! Where's your hat?
The bags are in the taxi.

29:55.620 --> 29:58.180
- Come on!
- I'm so sorry. Something's happened.

29:58.500 --> 30:00.138
What'd you do, lose your nerve?

30:00.220 --> 30:02.688
Where's that look
I was going to see so often?

30:04.860 --> 30:07.169
Stop! Don't whistle in my ear, please.

30:07.580 --> 30:09.332
What's wrong? Look at your hair.

30:09.420 --> 30:11.490
What color is it? Has it turned?

30:11.860 --> 30:14.852
Darling, what's the matter?
What happened?

30:16.460 --> 30:18.132
Those flowers are so beautiful.

30:18.220 --> 30:21.212
If I could only tell you, Elaine.
You smell so nice.

30:22.260 --> 30:23.488
You better go home!

30:23.580 --> 30:26.856
- But, darling, we were married today.
- Go to bed, get some rest!

30:26.940 --> 30:27.816
Rest?

30:29.980 --> 30:31.777
Who? Judge Cullman?

30:32.540 --> 30:36.613
This is Mortimer Brewster. I'll tell you
why I called you. It's about Teddy.

30:36.700 --> 30:38.736
I've got to come over
and see you right away.

30:38.820 --> 30:40.697
It won't wait until tomorrow, Judge.

30:40.780 --> 30:43.931
It's very, very important.
We've got to do something immediately.

30:44.020 --> 30:45.976
But it's a matter of life and... Elaine!

30:47.740 --> 30:48.889
Will you get out of here?

30:48.980 --> 30:51.733
What on earth is going on here?
I don't know where I stand!

30:51.820 --> 30:54.493
- Anywhere, but don't stand there!
- But Niagara Falls!

30:54.620 --> 30:57.180
- If it does, we'll let it!
- Wait a minute! Listen.

30:57.260 --> 30:59.330
You can't marry me
and then throw me out!

30:59.420 --> 31:02.890
I'm not throwing you out of the house!
Will you get out of here?

31:07.220 --> 31:09.097
I'm sorry, Judge. A thing happened.

31:09.380 --> 31:11.132
Judge, about Teddy, he's...

31:13.020 --> 31:14.419
It's his bugle blowing.

31:14.500 --> 31:17.458
The police want to throw
him into a state institution.

31:18.820 --> 31:20.333
How do you like that?

31:20.500 --> 31:23.378
- I read an ad here about a room to rent.
- Shut up!

31:30.140 --> 31:33.849
If you sign the papers and Teddy commits
himself, we can get him to Happy Dale.

31:33.940 --> 31:35.612
It's a wonderful place.

31:35.700 --> 31:36.689
You will?

31:36.820 --> 31:39.414
Fine! I'll be over
as soon as I've made another call.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.178
Doorbell's ringing, dear.

31:47.740 --> 31:49.412
How do you do? Come in.

31:49.620 --> 31:51.929
I understand you've got a room to rent.

31:52.060 --> 31:53.652
Do step in.

31:53.940 --> 31:57.091
- Are you the lady of the house?
- Yes, I'm Miss Brewster.

31:57.180 --> 31:59.410
Operator? Give me long distance, please.

31:59.500 --> 32:02.378
And this is my sister.
Another Miss Brewster.

32:02.540 --> 32:05.691
- My name's Gibbs.
- Well, do sit down.

32:05.940 --> 32:08.818
I'm sorry,
we're just setting the table for dinner.

32:09.500 --> 32:13.209
Now, this would be
a nice comfortable chair.

32:13.940 --> 32:17.728
Long distance? I want the Happy Dale
Sanitarium, Happy Dale, New York.

32:17.820 --> 32:21.654
- Is Brooklyn your home?
- I live in a hotel. Don't like it.

32:21.860 --> 32:25.375
Are your family Brooklyn people?

32:25.460 --> 32:28.736
- Haven't got any family.
- All alone in the world?

32:30.100 --> 32:32.898
- Well, Martha...
- No, Happy Dale.

32:33.500 --> 32:36.298
Well, you've come to just the right house.

32:36.380 --> 32:37.893
- Do sit down.
- Dale.

32:38.300 --> 32:40.336
"D" like in "dig," when you dig a lock.

32:40.420 --> 32:43.378
That's right.
"A" like in "arsenic". Got that?

32:43.860 --> 32:45.851
Is there always this much noise?

32:46.100 --> 32:47.658
He doesn't live with us.

32:47.740 --> 32:49.970
I can see the headlines now. Please.

32:51.420 --> 32:54.218
I'd like to see the room.
I don't think I'll like it.

32:54.300 --> 32:55.733
The room's upstairs.

32:55.820 --> 32:59.051
Won't you try a glass of our wine
before we start up?

32:59.220 --> 33:00.539
Never touch it.

33:00.660 --> 33:04.858
Well, we make this ourselves.
It's elderberry wine.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.415
Elderberry?

33:09.980 --> 33:12.733
I haven't tasted elderberry wine
since I was a boy.

33:12.820 --> 33:14.139
- Thank you.
- Operator!

33:14.220 --> 33:17.610
I don't want the Happy Dale Laundry!
I want the Happy Dale Sanitarium!

33:17.700 --> 33:21.170
Sanitarium! Sanitarium!
Yes, like a broken record!

33:21.300 --> 33:25.896
- Have your own elderberry bushes?
- No, but the cemetery's full of them.

33:26.580 --> 33:28.138
Well, skoal.

33:28.340 --> 33:30.979
Hello, operator! What's taking so long?

33:31.060 --> 33:33.528
It's only across the river!
I could swim it faster!

33:33.620 --> 33:34.450
Yes!

33:35.340 --> 33:36.534
Hello! Hell...

33:37.180 --> 33:37.930
What...

33:38.020 --> 33:39.453
What, they're busy?

33:39.540 --> 33:40.655
Busy?

33:41.100 --> 33:42.818
They're busy and you're dizzy!

33:42.900 --> 33:45.937
No, I'm not drunk, madam,
but you've given me an idea!

33:52.860 --> 33:55.090
Darling, I'm nervous. Don't do that.

33:56.020 --> 33:57.214
Not that.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.936
Get out of here! Do you want
to be poisoned, murdered, killed?

34:14.340 --> 34:15.568
They're nuts!

34:16.340 --> 34:17.773
You're telling me!

34:25.340 --> 34:28.172
Look, you can't do things like that!

34:34.940 --> 34:37.737
Now I don't know
how I can explain this to you...

34:39.500 --> 34:43.049
...but it's not only against the law,
it's wrong.

34:43.340 --> 34:44.931
Oh, piffle!

34:45.260 --> 34:47.137
It's not a nice thing to do.

34:47.900 --> 34:51.130
People wouldn't understand.
He wouldn't understand.

34:53.699 --> 34:55.292
What I mean is...

34:56.659 --> 34:59.538
This is developing into a very bad habit!

35:07.340 --> 35:09.251
Who? Happy Dale Sanitarium?

35:09.420 --> 35:11.172
That's amazing, operator.

35:11.700 --> 35:14.214
Happy Dale?
Let me talk to Mr. Witherspoon, please.

35:14.300 --> 35:15.938
Mr. Witherspoon speaking.

35:16.540 --> 35:18.929
How do you do, Mr. Brewster?
How are you?

35:20.460 --> 35:23.611
Mr. Witherspoon, do you...
I'm fine, thanks. How are you?

35:24.460 --> 35:28.089
Do you remember our conversation about
committing my brother to Happy Dale?

35:28.180 --> 35:30.933
You do? Well, we want
to commit him there immediately.

35:31.140 --> 35:32.050
Oh, dear.

35:32.340 --> 35:33.898
Oh, dear. That's too bad.

35:34.780 --> 35:37.817
Well, I'd hoped we wouldn't have him
for some time yet.

35:38.100 --> 35:41.012
We have several Theodore Roosevelts
at the moment...

35:41.140 --> 35:43.176
...and it would lead to trouble.

35:44.660 --> 35:46.571
Well, now, if he thought that...

35:46.700 --> 35:50.249
Mr. Brewster, we're a bit short
of Napoleons at present.

35:50.460 --> 35:52.451
Bonaparte. And if...

35:54.700 --> 35:56.258
Oh, I see. Of course.

35:56.620 --> 35:59.259
Well, if your mind is made up. Yes.

36:00.020 --> 36:01.453
Have you had the papers drawn up?

36:01.540 --> 36:04.338
No, but I'll do it now
and call you as soon as I have them.

36:04.860 --> 36:06.339
Thank you, Mr... What?

36:06.860 --> 36:08.816
All right. Thank you, Mr. Witherspoon.

36:10.020 --> 36:12.090
Another Roosevelt. Oh, dear.

36:12.540 --> 36:17.056
Now listen, I'm going to Judge Cullman's,
but I want you to promise me something.

36:17.140 --> 36:19.608
Well, we'd have to know what it was first.

36:19.940 --> 36:21.851
I love you both very much.

36:21.980 --> 36:24.255
You know I'd do anything for you,
don't you?

36:24.340 --> 36:25.409
Yes, dear.

36:25.620 --> 36:28.088
I want you to do one thing for me,
like good girls.

36:28.180 --> 36:29.579
What do you want us to do?

36:29.660 --> 36:32.697
Don't do anything.
I mean, don't do anything!

36:33.220 --> 36:36.132
Don't let anyone in the house
and leave Mr. Whosit where he is.

36:36.220 --> 36:39.735
Get off that thing. I can't talk to you...
I can't concentrate.

36:39.940 --> 36:42.738
I wouldn't want anything
in the world to happen to you.

36:42.820 --> 36:45.175
What on earth could happen to us?

36:45.260 --> 36:46.534
Well, darling...

36:46.660 --> 36:49.299
Anyway, you'll do that little thing for me,
won't you?

36:49.660 --> 36:51.537
Where's my hat? There it is.

36:51.700 --> 36:53.258
- But, Mortimer.
- What?

36:53.340 --> 36:56.696
We were planning to hold services
before dinner.

36:57.180 --> 37:00.855
- Couldn't that wait until I get back?
- You could join us in the hymns!

37:00.940 --> 37:04.057
Yes, darling, I'll sing with you,
I'll dance with you, anything.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.737
Remember, don't let anybody in the house
until I get back.

37:07.820 --> 37:08.969
You promise?

37:09.220 --> 37:10.175
Good.

37:12.340 --> 37:13.295
What?

37:15.140 --> 37:16.892
Stop that. What is it?

37:17.060 --> 37:18.573
Mr. Hoskins' hat!

37:24.220 --> 37:26.893
- Do you still want me to wait?
- Yes! Call me a cab!

37:26.980 --> 37:30.689
- Hey, cab! Here you are.
- Don't open it. I'll sit with you!

37:30.900 --> 37:34.256
Yeah, that's right.
I can go faster that way. Sure.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.491
Wait a minute! What am I doing?

37:40.780 --> 37:44.295
Fancy getting nice Mr. Hoskins' hat
all mussed up.

37:44.820 --> 37:47.380
Shame! Such a nice hat.

37:48.220 --> 37:52.657
You know, Mortimer didn't seem
to be quite himself today.

37:54.740 --> 37:55.775
Oh, well.

38:03.580 --> 38:05.969
What were you saying about Mortimer?

38:06.060 --> 38:08.858
I think I understand why
he seemed so upset.

38:09.100 --> 38:09.930
Why?

38:10.460 --> 38:12.337
He's just been married.

38:13.380 --> 38:16.338
I believe that always makes
a man a little nervous.

38:16.420 --> 38:18.058
Yes. The poor dears.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.816
I'm so happy for Elaine.

38:23.700 --> 38:24.610
Abby!

38:24.820 --> 38:28.859
If Mortimer's coming back for the services,
we'll need another hymnal.

38:29.100 --> 38:30.852
There's one up in my room.

38:33.300 --> 38:34.858
I'll go, dear.

38:36.220 --> 38:39.292
We promised Mortimer
we wouldn't let anyone come in.

38:44.780 --> 38:47.169
It's two men,
and I've never seen them before.

38:47.260 --> 38:49.137
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

38:49.860 --> 38:51.976
- Let me look.
- You look.

38:55.700 --> 38:58.658
- Do you recognize them?
- No, they're strangers to me.

39:01.460 --> 39:04.020
We'll just have to pretend
we're not at home.

39:34.100 --> 39:35.453
Come in, doctor.

39:39.540 --> 39:41.417
This is the home of my youth.

39:42.620 --> 39:45.737
As a boy, I couldn't wait to escape
from this house.

39:46.940 --> 39:49.374
Now I'm glad to escape back into it.

39:50.700 --> 39:52.770
Yes, Johnny, it's a good hideout.

39:54.460 --> 39:56.451
The family must still live here.

39:59.100 --> 40:02.615
I hope there's a fatted calf
awaiting the return of the prodigal.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.094
A fatted calf?

40:05.020 --> 40:06.931
Johnny, I'm so hungry.

40:07.340 --> 40:09.490
Look, Johnny. Drink.

40:10.220 --> 40:12.211
As if we were expected.

40:12.500 --> 40:13.649
A good omen.

40:14.060 --> 40:15.778
Who are you?

40:16.060 --> 40:17.778
What are you doing here?

40:19.460 --> 40:21.849
Aunt Abby. Aunt Martha.

40:23.580 --> 40:24.854
It's Jonathan.

40:25.460 --> 40:26.973
You get out of here!

40:27.700 --> 40:29.372
I'm Jonathan, you know.

40:30.060 --> 40:31.652
Your nephew, Jonathan.

40:31.860 --> 40:33.088
No, you're not.

40:33.220 --> 40:36.257
You're nothing like Jonathan,
so don't pretend you are.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.058
You just get out of here.

40:38.140 --> 40:41.132
I see you're still wearing
the lovely garnet ring...

40:41.260 --> 40:43.728
...that Grandma Brewster
bought in England.

40:44.740 --> 40:47.413
And you, Aunt Martha,
still the high collar...

40:47.500 --> 40:50.970
...to hide the scar
where Grandfather's acid burned you.

40:51.900 --> 40:54.573
Why, his voice is like Jonathan's.

40:56.780 --> 40:59.294
Have you been in an accident?

40:59.380 --> 41:00.733
My face.

41:01.940 --> 41:04.659
Dr. Einstein is responsible for that.

41:04.860 --> 41:06.578
He's a plastic surgeon.

41:07.140 --> 41:09.449
But I've seen that face before.

41:12.060 --> 41:15.291
Do you remember when we took
the little Schultz boy to the movies...

41:15.380 --> 41:16.972
...and I was so frightened?

41:17.060 --> 41:18.413
It was that face.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.771
Take it easy, Johnny. Take it easy.

41:23.860 --> 41:27.057
Don't worry. The last five years,
I give him three different faces.

41:27.140 --> 41:29.210
I give him another one right away.

41:29.580 --> 41:32.890
That last face. I saw that picture, too...

41:33.140 --> 41:37.372
...just before I operated. I was intoxicated.

41:37.460 --> 41:40.020
You see, doctor, what you've done to me?

41:40.420 --> 41:43.332
- Even my own family think I'm...
- Johnny, Johnny!

41:43.540 --> 41:47.135
You are home in this lovely house.

41:47.580 --> 41:48.774
You know...

41:50.260 --> 41:52.774
...how many times he tells me...

41:53.020 --> 41:56.456
...about Brooklyn, about this house
and about his aunts...

41:56.540 --> 41:58.098
...he loves so much?

41:58.420 --> 41:59.569
They know you.

41:59.660 --> 42:01.378
Please tell him so.

42:04.220 --> 42:05.892
Jonathan...

42:06.180 --> 42:07.818
...it's been a long time.

42:07.940 --> 42:10.534
Bless you. It's good to be home again.

42:15.780 --> 42:18.419
We mustn't let what's on the stove
boil over.

42:20.100 --> 42:22.660
If you'll excuse us for a moment, Jonathan.

42:22.900 --> 42:26.256
Unless you're in a hurry to go somewhere.

42:44.980 --> 42:46.811
Where do we go from here?

42:48.580 --> 42:50.855
You know, we got to think fast.

42:51.660 --> 42:55.812
The police got pictures of that face.
I got to operate on you right away.

42:56.220 --> 42:57.938
We got to find someplace.

42:59.420 --> 43:02.298
We got to find someplace
for Mr. Spenalzo, too.

43:03.060 --> 43:05.176
Don't waste any worry on that rat.

43:05.460 --> 43:08.338
But we got a hot stiff on our hands.

43:08.820 --> 43:10.458
Forget Mr. Spenalzo.

43:10.780 --> 43:13.977
But, Johnny, we can't leave
a dead body in the rumble seat.

43:14.580 --> 43:16.332
You shouldn't have killed him.

43:16.420 --> 43:19.730
Just because he knows something
about us, what happens?

43:22.660 --> 43:25.652
We come to him for help
and he tries to shake us down.

43:28.660 --> 43:32.573
Besides, he said I looked like Boris Karloff.

43:35.580 --> 43:37.252
That's your work, doctor.

43:37.340 --> 43:38.739
You did that to me.

43:38.900 --> 43:40.731
Please, Johnny, take it easy.

43:40.860 --> 43:44.091
We'll find some place
and I'll fix you up right away.

43:44.180 --> 43:46.740
Yes, tonight, but I have to eat first.

43:46.980 --> 43:49.938
This time, I want the face
of an absolute nonentity.

43:50.380 --> 43:53.417
Yes. I know exactly what I'm going to do.

43:53.580 --> 43:56.890
You see, I'm going to take this piece here
and lift it up...

43:56.980 --> 43:59.050
Be careful about the stitches this time.

43:59.140 --> 44:00.812
You leave that up to me.

44:00.900 --> 44:02.413
I'll give you nice ears and...

44:02.500 --> 44:05.219
- You were careless last time.
- And new stitches.

44:05.340 --> 44:08.537
And on the eyes I'll do a Schmidt.
That's my specialty.

44:08.660 --> 44:11.891
- I take it together like this...
- Leave the eyes alone.

44:12.060 --> 44:13.652
Leave the nose alone.

44:13.900 --> 44:15.333
Poor Teddy.

44:15.860 --> 44:17.976
I imagine it's for the best.

44:20.420 --> 44:23.776
"Ours not to reason why, ours but to do... "

44:23.900 --> 44:26.368
Sign right here, please, Judge. Excuse me.

44:26.500 --> 44:27.979
Right there.

44:28.180 --> 44:31.968
Sometimes I think,
with the world in its present chaotic state...

44:32.060 --> 44:35.894
Yes, we'd all be better off at Happy Dale.
I sign here as next of kin, don't I?

44:36.260 --> 44:39.775
Only last week I created a mild sensation...

44:39.860 --> 44:42.772
...at the Bar Association, when I said...

44:42.900 --> 44:44.936
Goodbye. Good luck, Judge. Thank you.

44:45.020 --> 44:48.979
Tell Martha and Abby I'll be over this week.
I've been feeling rather lonely.

44:49.100 --> 44:51.933
No! Never tell them
you've been lonely. Never!

44:52.020 --> 44:54.409
- Why, I don't...
- Judge!

44:55.180 --> 44:57.330
Tell me, are you a drinking man?

44:57.620 --> 45:00.293
Why, no. I never indulge.

45:00.420 --> 45:02.331
Good! Then you'll live longer.

45:02.420 --> 45:04.536
Of course a little wine now...

45:04.620 --> 45:06.770
No! For heaven's sake, no wine!

45:09.420 --> 45:11.854
I may be committing the wrong Brewster.

45:14.020 --> 45:17.330
Well, I'm sure you both want to get
to wherever you're going.

45:17.740 --> 45:21.733
My dear, sweet aunties,
I'm so full of your delicious dinner...

45:22.100 --> 45:25.615
- ...I'm unable to move a muscle.
- Yes, it's nice here.

45:25.820 --> 45:27.219
I found it!

45:29.580 --> 45:31.093
Gentlemen, be seated.

45:34.020 --> 45:37.092
Here it is, gentlemen.
The story of my life, my biography.

45:37.180 --> 45:40.252
Here's the picture I was telling you about.
Here we both are.

45:40.340 --> 45:42.934
President Roosevelt and General Goethals
at Culebra Cut.

45:43.100 --> 45:45.216
That's me, General, and that's you.

45:46.260 --> 45:48.216
My, how I've changed!

45:48.980 --> 45:53.132
That picture hasn't been taken yet.
We haven't started work on Culebra Cut.

45:53.260 --> 45:54.739
We're still digging locks.

45:54.820 --> 45:58.574
And now, General, we will both go
to Panama and inspect the new lock.

45:58.660 --> 46:00.730
No, Teddy. Not to Panama.

46:00.820 --> 46:04.699
Maybe some other time, Mr. President.
Panama is a long ways off.

46:04.780 --> 46:07.533
- Nonsense! It's just down in the cellar.
- The cellar?

46:08.060 --> 46:11.291
We let him dig the Panama Canal
in the cellar.

46:11.940 --> 46:13.931
- General Goethals?
- Yes, sir.

46:14.140 --> 46:17.098
As President of the US, Commander
in Chief of the Army and Navy...

46:17.180 --> 46:19.136
...and the man who gave you this job...

46:19.220 --> 46:22.769
...I demand that you accompany me
on the inspection of the new lock.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.169
I think it's time for you to go to bed.

46:25.660 --> 46:28.936
I beg your pardon. Who are you?

46:29.020 --> 46:30.931
I'm Woodrow Wilson. Go to bed.

46:33.140 --> 46:36.291
No, you're not Wilson.
But your face is familiar.

46:37.020 --> 46:41.013
You're not anyone I know now.
Perhaps later, on my hunting trip to Africa.

46:41.100 --> 46:43.853
You look like someone
I might meet in the jungle.

46:44.420 --> 46:47.617
I think, perhaps,
you had better go to bed, Teddy.

46:47.780 --> 46:50.578
He and his friend want to get back
to their hotel.

46:51.260 --> 46:53.057
General Goethals, inspect the canal.

46:54.140 --> 46:56.574
All right, Mr. President, we go to Panama.

46:56.740 --> 46:59.413
Bully, bully! Follow me, General.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.731
It's down south, you know.

47:07.980 --> 47:09.379
Well, bon voyage!

47:14.420 --> 47:16.570
I must correct your misapprehension.

47:17.620 --> 47:19.497
You talked of our hotel.

47:19.620 --> 47:23.135
We have no hotel. We came here directly.

47:23.460 --> 47:27.499
This is not your home,
and I'm afraid you can't stay here.

47:31.820 --> 47:35.449
Dr. Einstein and I need a place to sleep.

47:35.980 --> 47:39.052
You remember that, as a boy,
I could be disagreeable.

47:39.900 --> 47:43.131
It would not be pleasant for any of us if...

47:43.220 --> 47:45.973
I don't have to go into details, do I?

47:46.540 --> 47:49.008
Perhaps we'd better let them
stay here tonight.

47:50.900 --> 47:52.618
Come here. Quick.

47:52.700 --> 47:53.769
I forgot to tell you...

47:53.860 --> 47:58.058
...Doctor and I are turning Grandfather's
laboratory into an operating room.

47:58.220 --> 48:00.256
We expect to be very busy.

48:04.180 --> 48:06.694
- Down here, what do you think I find?
- What?

48:06.780 --> 48:08.577
The Panama Canal.

48:09.260 --> 48:11.330
And it just fits Mr. Spenalzo.

48:12.060 --> 48:15.496
See the hole he's digging.
Four feet wide, six feet long.

48:15.580 --> 48:16.933
He just fits!

48:17.060 --> 48:20.370
You'd think he knew
we were bringing Mr. Spenalzo along.

48:20.740 --> 48:22.298
That's hospitality.

48:22.740 --> 48:24.617
Rather a good joke on my aunts.

48:24.700 --> 48:27.976
They're living in a house
with a body buried in the cellar.

48:30.620 --> 48:32.451
How do we get him in here?

48:32.740 --> 48:36.653
Yes, we can't just walk
Mr. Spenalzo in through the door.

48:36.780 --> 48:41.251
We'll get the car and after they're in bed,
we'll bring him in through the window.

48:41.340 --> 48:42.216
Bed.

48:44.740 --> 48:48.016
We're moving the car behind the house.
You'd better get to bed.

48:48.100 --> 48:50.694
The car is all right where it is
until morning.

48:50.780 --> 48:54.739
I don't want to leave it in the street.
That might be against the law.

49:00.340 --> 49:02.137
What are we going to do?

49:02.340 --> 49:06.253
We're not going to let them spend
more than one night in this house.

49:06.460 --> 49:08.212
What would the neighbors think?

49:08.300 --> 49:11.770
People coming in here with one face
and going out with another.

49:12.700 --> 49:15.134
What are we going to do
about Mr. Hoskins?

49:15.700 --> 49:17.292
Mr. Hoskins!

49:17.660 --> 49:20.458
It can't be very comfortable
for him in there.

49:20.740 --> 49:23.812
And he's been so patient, the poor dear.

49:25.340 --> 49:29.253
I think Teddy had better take
Mr. Hoskins downstairs right away.

49:30.260 --> 49:34.458
General Goethals was very pleased.
He said the canal was just the right size.

49:36.180 --> 49:39.695
Teddy, there's been
another yellow-fever victim.

49:39.900 --> 49:43.370
Dear me!
This will be a shock to the General.

49:44.100 --> 49:46.853
No, we must keep it a secret.

49:48.340 --> 49:49.534
A state secret?

49:49.660 --> 49:51.491
Yes, a state secret.

49:51.700 --> 49:52.689
Promise?

49:53.500 --> 49:56.173
You have the word of the President
of the United States.

49:56.260 --> 49:59.730
Cross my heart and hope to die.
Now, let's see.

50:00.460 --> 50:02.769
How are we going to keep it a secret?

50:02.980 --> 50:06.416
Teddy, I think you'd better get back down
into the cellar.

50:06.580 --> 50:07.729
And then...

50:07.860 --> 50:11.489
...when I turn out the lights,
when everything's dark here...

50:11.780 --> 50:14.499
...you come up and take
the poor man down to the canal.

50:14.580 --> 50:15.729
Now get along.

50:15.900 --> 50:18.858
And we'll come down later
and hold services.

50:19.780 --> 50:22.169
- Where is the poor devil?
- In the windowseat.

50:22.260 --> 50:23.659
It seems to be spreading.

50:23.740 --> 50:26.300
We've never had yellow fever there before.

50:30.500 --> 50:33.378
I've never even seen Mr. Hoskins!

50:33.540 --> 50:36.816
My goodness! That's right, you were out.

50:37.780 --> 50:41.011
You just come right along
and see him now.

50:41.980 --> 50:46.576
You know, he's really very nice looking,
considering that he's a Methodist.

51:02.700 --> 51:05.055
We're bringing the luggage through here.

51:11.340 --> 51:14.889
Your room is waiting for you.
You can go right up.

51:15.780 --> 51:19.534
I'm afraid we don't keep Brooklyn hours.
You two run along to bed.

51:19.780 --> 51:22.817
But you must be very tired. Both of you.

51:22.980 --> 51:26.973
- And we don't go to bed this early.
- It's time I came home to take care of you.

51:27.220 --> 51:29.051
Take the bags upstairs.

51:29.380 --> 51:32.019
For the instruments, I'll come back later.

51:32.300 --> 51:33.574
Good night.

51:34.100 --> 51:35.533
Now, we'll all go to bed.

51:35.620 --> 51:39.329
I'll wait until you're up
and then turn out the lights.

51:40.020 --> 51:41.817
Run along, Aunt Martha.

51:43.180 --> 51:45.250
Just off the laboratory, Doctor.

51:52.700 --> 51:55.168
- All right, Aunt Abby.
- I'll be right up.

51:55.340 --> 51:57.570
Now! Turn out the lights.

52:28.060 --> 52:29.539
Aunt Abby.

54:29.660 --> 54:30.888
He's all right, Johnny.

54:40.020 --> 54:42.978
I'll open the window.
You go round and hand him through.

54:43.180 --> 54:45.455
But he's too heavy for me.

54:46.940 --> 54:50.330
You go outside and push,
and I'll stay here and pull.

54:50.540 --> 54:53.259
And then together we take him
down to Panama.

54:53.780 --> 54:57.329
All right. We must be quick.
I'll take a look around outside the house.

54:57.540 --> 55:00.008
When I tap on the glass,
you open the window.

55:00.100 --> 55:01.055
Yeah.

55:08.740 --> 55:10.332
It's dark in here.

55:23.300 --> 55:24.415
Where am I?

55:25.460 --> 55:26.575
Here I am.

55:27.740 --> 55:30.300
Who left this open?

55:35.380 --> 55:38.338
Okay, wait a minute. Hand him over.

55:38.540 --> 55:41.100
Now I have him. Allez, up!

55:42.500 --> 55:46.254
Now, wait a minute.
You lost a leg somewhere.

55:48.780 --> 55:50.577
Help me. He's so heavy.

55:50.780 --> 55:53.931
Now I have him. Now I got him.

55:54.860 --> 55:58.057
- Be careful.
- But his shoe came off.

55:59.060 --> 56:01.858
Help me. He's so heavy.

56:02.060 --> 56:04.176
Now I've got him!

56:05.780 --> 56:08.897
Johnny, somebody's at the door.
Go open, quick.

56:09.100 --> 56:12.172
I'll manage Spenalzo. Go, quick!

56:25.260 --> 56:26.249
Mortimer!

56:30.940 --> 56:32.009
Aunt Abby!

56:33.900 --> 56:35.094
Aunt Martha!

56:40.260 --> 56:41.295
Who is it?

56:41.380 --> 56:42.813
Is that you, Teddy?

56:42.900 --> 56:43.855
Who are you?

56:43.940 --> 56:46.170
I'm Elaine Harper. I live next door.

56:46.420 --> 56:48.058
What are you doing here?

56:48.140 --> 56:50.449
I came here to see my husband, Mortimer.

56:50.540 --> 56:52.690
Why did you say your name was Harper?

56:52.780 --> 56:54.691
It is Harper. I mean, it's Brewster.

56:54.780 --> 56:57.374
I'm not very used to it.
I'm a brand-new Brewster.

56:57.460 --> 56:58.415
Doctor!

56:59.660 --> 57:01.491
It's all right. It's okay.

57:10.740 --> 57:13.208
Maybe you'd better explain
what you're doing here.

57:13.300 --> 57:15.256
We happen to live here.

57:15.540 --> 57:17.019
You don't live here.

57:17.100 --> 57:19.694
I'm in this house every day,
I've never seen you before.

57:19.780 --> 57:22.852
Where are Martha and Abby?
What have you done to them?

57:23.940 --> 57:26.329
Perhaps we'd better introduce ourselves.

57:26.740 --> 57:29.254
May I present Dr. Einstein?

57:29.700 --> 57:31.656
Dr. Einstein?

57:31.820 --> 57:34.209
A surgeon of great distinction.

57:36.500 --> 57:38.570
And something of a magician.

57:39.300 --> 57:43.009
- I suppose you'll tell me you're Boris...
- I am Jonathan Brewster.

57:45.260 --> 57:47.649
- You're Jonathan.
- You've heard of me?

57:47.820 --> 57:50.732
- Yes, they talk about you.
- What do they say about me?

57:50.820 --> 57:54.176
Just that there's another brother
named Jonathan, that's all.

57:54.860 --> 57:57.897
That explains everything.
Now that I know who you are...

57:58.060 --> 58:01.496
...I'll just be running along
if you'll kindly unlock the door.

58:13.940 --> 58:17.410
"That explains everything".
Just what do you mean by that?

58:17.540 --> 58:20.008
Why do you come here
at this time of night?

58:20.140 --> 58:23.815
I just thought I saw Mortimer drive up.
I suppose it was you.

58:26.940 --> 58:29.249
You thought you saw someone drive up?

58:29.620 --> 58:32.373
Yes. Weren't you just outside?
Isn't that your car?

58:32.460 --> 58:34.849
- You saw someone at the car?
- Yes.

58:35.060 --> 58:37.699
- What else did you see?
- Just that, that's all!

58:37.820 --> 58:40.653
I see. Is that why you came over here?

58:40.740 --> 58:44.176
No, I came to see Mortimer.
But if he's not home, I'll run...

58:44.300 --> 58:46.256
- You've given two names.
- You're hurting me!

58:46.340 --> 58:48.410
I think she's dangerous.

58:48.540 --> 58:50.895
No visitors. It's going to be
a private funeral.

58:54.660 --> 58:58.050
- Tell these men who I am!
- That's my daughter, Alice.

58:58.380 --> 58:59.176
No!

59:00.500 --> 59:03.219
Don't be a tomboy.
Don't play rough with the gentlemen.

59:03.300 --> 59:04.289
Charge!

59:13.180 --> 59:14.659
Doctor, the cellar.

59:16.420 --> 59:18.138
Let go of me!

59:18.860 --> 59:20.532
Let go of me!

59:21.580 --> 59:23.775
What's the matter?
What's happening down there?

59:27.500 --> 59:30.014
What's the matter?
What are you doing there?

59:30.380 --> 59:33.690
We caught a burglar, a sneak thief.
Go back to your room.

59:33.860 --> 59:37.489
- We'll call the police.
- I'll handle this. Go back to your room.

59:38.180 --> 59:39.408
Do you hear me?

59:42.100 --> 59:43.579
Don't answer that.

59:44.580 --> 59:46.013
Don't answer that!

59:58.940 --> 01:00:02.728
Where's Teddy? Is he upstairs?
Never mind that now, darling.

01:00:02.820 --> 01:00:05.459
What are you doing
with your best clothes on?

01:00:05.980 --> 01:00:08.050
Holy... What's that?

01:00:10.140 --> 01:00:12.700
What's that thing that looks like
a cigar-store dummy?

01:00:12.780 --> 01:00:17.217
- It's your brother and Dr. Einstein.
- Didn't I tell you not to let anybody in?

01:00:17.300 --> 01:00:20.451
- Who did you say it was?
- It's your brother, Jonathan!

01:00:25.220 --> 01:00:28.053
- I've come back home, Mortimer.
- What?

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.251
I've come back home, Mortimer.

01:00:30.340 --> 01:00:33.457
"I've come back home, Mortimer".
Listen, it talks!

01:00:34.860 --> 01:00:36.452
Yes, I talk.

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.098
Mortimer, have you forgotten
the things I used to do to you...

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:43.530
...when you were tied to the bedpost?

01:00:43.620 --> 01:00:47.010
The needles under your fingernails.

01:00:47.220 --> 01:00:49.131
- Mortimer, he...
- Wait a minute.

01:00:56.860 --> 01:00:58.452
Holy mackerel!

01:00:58.660 --> 01:00:59.695
It is Jonathan!

01:00:59.780 --> 01:01:01.577
I'm glad you remember, Mortimer.

01:01:03.180 --> 01:01:04.579
Yeah, I remember.

01:01:05.020 --> 01:01:06.658
How could I forget you?

01:01:07.100 --> 01:01:09.375
Where'd you get that face? Hollywood?

01:01:10.020 --> 01:01:14.298
Don't you two boys start quarreling
the minute you've seen each other.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:17.656
We invited Jonathan
and Dr. Einstein to stay.

01:01:18.100 --> 01:01:20.091
- What?
- Just for tonight.

01:01:20.220 --> 01:01:22.097
No, I'm staying here tonight.

01:01:22.220 --> 01:01:24.780
- In fact, I'm staying here from now on.
- What about me?

01:01:24.860 --> 01:01:26.816
There's no room for anybody else here.

01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:28.299
Please, just a moment.

01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:30.655
So take that little squirt and beat it!

01:01:30.860 --> 01:01:33.499
Where's Teddy?
I've got to see him right away.

01:01:34.660 --> 01:01:36.332
We don't take up much room.

01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:39.617
Johnny can sleep on the sofa,
and I'll sleep on the windowseat.

01:01:39.700 --> 01:01:40.974
Nothing to...

01:01:41.260 --> 01:01:42.613
Windowseat?

01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:44.893
Certainly not on the windowseat.

01:01:44.980 --> 01:01:47.210
I'm going to sleep on the windowseat.

01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:49.411
I'll sleep on the windowseat from now on.

01:01:51.500 --> 01:01:52.489
Now look.

01:01:53.460 --> 01:01:54.893
Now, be a good fellow.

01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:57.699
Here's $10. Go out
and haunt yourself a hotel.

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:04.179
Mortimer, you know what I do
to people who order me around.

01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:08.893
Mr. Spenalzo.

01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:09.976
What?

01:02:10.100 --> 01:02:13.297
What's going to happen to Mr. Spenalzo?

01:02:14.460 --> 01:02:17.213
We can't leave him here
in the windowseat.

01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:25.936
Doctor, I've completely lost track
of Mr. Spenalzo.

01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:28.489
Wait! Who's this Mr. Spenalzo?

01:02:28.660 --> 01:02:30.969
A friend of ours Johnny was looking for.

01:02:31.060 --> 01:02:33.528
Don't bring anyone else in here.
Now, beat it!

01:02:33.620 --> 01:02:34.973
It's all right, Johnny.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:37.654
While we are packing,
I'll tell you about him.

01:02:43.860 --> 01:02:46.932
I'll take care of you, Mortimer,
in just a little while.

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.294
How do you like that?

01:02:49.380 --> 01:02:52.656
The guy stays away for 20 years
and picks tonight to come back.

01:02:52.740 --> 01:02:54.651
Elaine, what are you doing here?

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:56.975
- Mortimer!
- What's the matter, darling?

01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.052
- I almost got killed.
- Killed?

01:03:01.020 --> 01:03:02.453
Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha!

01:03:03.820 --> 01:03:05.492
No! It was Jonathan!

01:03:05.860 --> 01:03:07.896
He mistook her for a sneak thief.

01:03:07.980 --> 01:03:10.096
- Oh, that.
- It was worse than that.

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:11.938
He's some kind of a maniac.

01:03:12.020 --> 01:03:13.373
I'm afraid of him.

01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.099
Darling, don't worry about it.
I'm here now. Forget it.

01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:19.178
We were married today,
we were going over Niagara Falls...

01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:22.616
...your brother tries to strangle me,
a taxi's waiting...

01:03:22.820 --> 01:03:25.015
...and now you want to sleep
on a windowseat!

01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:26.931
Windowseat. Witherspoon.

01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:29.136
- You'd better run along home.
- What?

01:03:29.220 --> 01:03:31.939
Go on home like a good girl.
I got things to do.

01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:33.294
- But...
- Please.

01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:36.094
Operator?
Get me Happy Dale 2-7-0, please.

01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:38.769
But didn't you hear what I was just saying?

01:03:38.860 --> 01:03:41.897
Your own brother Jonathan,
he was trying to strangle me!

01:03:42.020 --> 01:03:44.295
- Please! This is important!
- That?

01:03:44.980 --> 01:03:47.130
Mr. Witherspoon?
This is Mortimer Brewster.

01:03:47.220 --> 01:03:49.256
Yes, Mr. Brewster.

01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.089
Well, I don't understand you.

01:03:52.180 --> 01:03:55.013
- He was going to kill me!
- Wait, I can't hear the man.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:57.250
Well, look.
I've got the papers all drawn up.

01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:01.697
I know it's late, but come down here
and get my brother immediately!

01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:02.855
Please, darling.

01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:06.774
By the way, you've had the papers signed
by your brother and the doctor, of course?

01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:08.009
By the doctor?

01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:10.973
Oh, holy mackerel! I forgot the doctor!

01:04:12.900 --> 01:04:15.812
Please, be quiet! Can't you see
I've got to get a doctor?

01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:18.136
What kind of a doctor? A family doctor?

01:04:18.220 --> 01:04:21.576
You can take your honeymoon,
wedding ring, taxi, windowseat...

01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.538
...put them in a barrel,
and push them all over Niagara Falls!

01:04:24.620 --> 01:04:26.292
Thank you, darling. Thank you.

01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:28.814
Why don't you come down here anyway?

01:04:28.900 --> 01:04:32.449
While you're getting here,
I'll get Teddy's and the doctor's signatures.

01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.772
I'll get both signatures.
Yeah, well, come right away.

01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.132
What's the matter with her?

01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:52.058
Let me sit down.
Let me think about this thing.

01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.933
Doctor, Teddy, signature...

01:04:56.700 --> 01:04:57.928
Hoskins!

01:05:15.740 --> 01:05:17.856
Ye gods! There's another one!

01:05:19.180 --> 01:05:20.533
Aunt Abby! Aunt Martha!

01:05:20.620 --> 01:05:22.736
- Come in here!
- We're busy.

01:05:22.820 --> 01:05:24.811
No, you come in here now!

01:05:26.700 --> 01:05:29.134
Yes, dear, what is it? Where's Elaine?

01:05:29.340 --> 01:05:31.535
Didn't you promise not to let anyone in?

01:05:31.620 --> 01:05:33.850
- Jonathan just walked in.
- I don't mean Jonathan!

01:05:33.940 --> 01:05:36.898
I don't mean Dr. Einstein!
Who is that in the windowseat?

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.652
We told you. Mr. Hoskins.

01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:41.095
It is not Mr. Hoskins!

01:05:41.820 --> 01:05:42.775
There!

01:05:44.860 --> 01:05:46.179
Who can that be?

01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:52.056
- Are you saying you've never seen him?
- I certainly am.

01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:53.858
This is a fine how-do-you-do!

01:05:53.940 --> 01:05:56.295
It's getting so anyone thinks
he can walk in!

01:05:56.420 --> 01:06:00.299
Don't you try to get out of this!
That's another one of your gentlemen!

01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:02.530
How can you say such a thing?

01:06:02.900 --> 01:06:04.970
That man's an impostor.

01:06:05.900 --> 01:06:09.813
And if he came here to be buried
in our cellar, he's mistaken.

01:06:11.220 --> 01:06:13.688
You admitted you put Mr. Hoskins
in the windowseat.

01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:14.576
Yes, I did.

01:06:14.660 --> 01:06:17.379
This man couldn't have got the idea
from Mr. Hoskins!

01:06:17.460 --> 01:06:20.896
- By the way, where is Mr. Hoskins?
- He must have gone to Panama.

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:22.738
- What? You buried him?
- Not yet.

01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:25.698
He's down there
waiting for the services, poor dear.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:29.170
We haven't had a minute,
what with Jonathan in the house.

01:06:31.180 --> 01:06:32.056
Oh, dear.

01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:35.690
We've always wanted
to hold a double funeral.

01:06:35.900 --> 01:06:39.529
But I will not read services
over a total stranger!

01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:43.338
A total stranger. How can I believe you?

01:06:43.420 --> 01:06:46.218
There are 12 men down there,
you admit you poisoned them!

01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:50.259
Yes, I did. But you don't think
I'd stoop to telling a fib!

01:06:51.860 --> 01:06:53.816
What do you think has happened?

01:06:54.060 --> 01:06:55.379
"A fib! "

01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:14.938
This may interest you, Mortimer.
I've decided that we're staying.

01:07:15.060 --> 01:07:19.372
And I've also decided that you're leaving,
and I mean now.

01:07:19.540 --> 01:07:22.498
Listen, handsome. I'm in no mood
to debate the question.

01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.652
Are you getting out,
or am I throwing you out on your ear?

01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:27.970
I've led a strange life.

01:07:28.740 --> 01:07:30.492
Martha, you come straight along here.

01:07:30.580 --> 01:07:33.333
You just look and see
what's in that windowseat.

01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.448
No. Don't...

01:07:59.020 --> 01:08:01.659
Let Aunt Martha see
what's in the windowseat.

01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:08.498
Aunt Abby, darling, I owe you an apology.

01:08:08.700 --> 01:08:11.976
I've got some very good news for you.
Jonathan is leaving.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:17.134
And he's taking Dr. Einstein
and that cold companion with him.

01:08:22.420 --> 01:08:25.298
Listen. You're my brother,
you're a Brewster.

01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:28.531
I'll give you a chance to get away
and take the evidence with you.

01:08:28.700 --> 01:08:30.930
You can't ask for more than that.

01:08:31.859 --> 01:08:32.849
Well?

01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:38.412
All right, in that case,
I'll have to call the police.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:42.457
Don't reach for the telephone.

01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:46.288
Remember, what happened
to Mr. Spenalzo can happen to you, too.

01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:47.774
Spenalzo?

01:08:47.979 --> 01:08:50.255
I knew he was a foreigner.

01:08:50.979 --> 01:08:52.857
Put down that telephone.

01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:02.609
Officer O'Hara!

01:09:02.700 --> 01:09:05.453
I saw the lights and thought
you might have sickness...

01:09:05.540 --> 01:09:07.371
You got company? Sorry I disturbed you.

01:09:07.460 --> 01:09:09.814
- No! Come in.
- Yes, do come in.

01:09:09.899 --> 01:09:12.733
Come right in, Officer.
This is our nephew, Mortimer.

01:09:12.819 --> 01:09:14.697
- Pleased to meet you.
- Glad to see you.

01:09:14.779 --> 01:09:18.408
- And this is another nephew, Jonathan.
- Pleased to make your acquaintance.

01:09:18.779 --> 01:09:21.738
Your face is familiar.
Haven't I seen a picture of you?

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:23.572
I don't think so.

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:26.697
- I'll be running along.
- Why? Stay until my brother leaves.

01:09:26.779 --> 01:09:28.133
I got to ring in, Mr...

01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:31.292
Are you "the" Mortimer Brewster,
the writer and dramatic critic?

01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:32.216
Yes, why?

01:09:32.300 --> 01:09:36.134
What a break for me! I'm a playwright.
I'm working on a play now.

01:09:36.260 --> 01:09:39.491
You are? Well, well, well!

01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:42.772
- Maybe I can help you with it.
- Would you? What a break!

01:09:42.859 --> 01:09:45.249
I get wonderful ideas,
but I can't spell them.

01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:47.694
I can spell like the dickens.
Constantinople?

01:09:47.779 --> 01:09:50.340
Let's go into the kitchen.
You can tell me all about it.

01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:52.371
Couldn't you whip up a sandwich?

01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:55.691
I hope you don't mind
eating in the kitchen, Officer O'Hara.

01:09:55.820 --> 01:09:57.697
And where else would you eat?

01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:00.339
See you in a moment.

01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.733
This is your last chance.

01:10:03.820 --> 01:10:06.380
I'll keep O'Hara busy
to give you a chance to get out.

01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.849
All three of you:
you, Dr. Einstein and Spenalzo.

01:10:08.940 --> 01:10:13.218
If you don't leave here, I'll introduce
Officer O'Hara to Mr. Spenalzo.

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.733
My play takes place in...

01:10:14.820 --> 01:10:17.288
I'll be right with you, O'Hara.
Right with you.

01:10:18.460 --> 01:10:20.132
Just give me one moment.

01:10:20.940 --> 01:10:23.374
Now get going! All three of you.

01:10:32.900 --> 01:10:36.097
This affair between my brother and myself
has got to be settled.

01:10:36.180 --> 01:10:39.855
But we've got trouble enough as it is.
Come, let's go.

01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:43.052
We're not going.
We're sleeping right here in this house.

01:10:43.140 --> 01:10:47.019
What? With a cop in the kitchen
and Spenalzo in the windowseat?

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:50.769
That's all he's got on us. We'll take
Spenalzo and dump him in the bay.

01:10:50.860 --> 01:10:54.250
After that, we're coming back here.
Then if he tries to interfere...

01:10:54.340 --> 01:10:56.092
No, no, Johnny. No, please.

01:10:56.180 --> 01:10:59.217
We've got a wonderful setup here.
We can make a fortune.

01:10:59.420 --> 01:11:03.811
Two old ladies as a front.
Only Mortimer stands in our way.

01:11:04.020 --> 01:11:06.329
I never did like Mortimer.

01:11:06.500 --> 01:11:08.650
Please, take it easy. Please!

01:11:08.860 --> 01:11:10.896
Doctor, you know
when I make up my mind...

01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.659
When you make up your mind,
you lose your head.

01:11:13.860 --> 01:11:16.977
Look, Brooklyn ain't a good setup for you.

01:11:18.060 --> 01:11:20.449
Okay, Johnny. Okay!

01:11:21.980 --> 01:11:25.336
Take the instruments and hide them
in the cellar. Move fast.

01:11:27.660 --> 01:11:30.732
- You don't know what goes on in Brooklyn.
- I don't know.

01:11:30.860 --> 01:11:33.579
- My mother was an actress.
- Legitimate?

01:11:33.660 --> 01:11:35.298
Of course. She was my mother.

01:11:35.380 --> 01:11:37.416
- Excuse me.
- Peaches La Tour was her name.

01:11:39.060 --> 01:11:40.857
- Come quick!
- What's the matter?

01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.056
- You know that hole in the cellar?
- Yes.

01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:45.529
Well, we got an ace in the hole.

01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:50.178
It's no fly-by-night idea.
I worked on it for 12 years.

01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:52.775
Well, rehash it. I'll be back in a minute.

01:11:52.860 --> 01:11:54.498
- Swell.
- I like the first act.

01:11:54.580 --> 01:11:56.457
I didn't tell you the first...

01:12:03.740 --> 01:12:05.492
I thought I told you...

01:12:10.180 --> 01:12:11.898
Yes, Mortimer.

01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:16.773
What are you doing still here?
I thought I said beat it.

01:12:16.860 --> 01:12:18.054
We're not going.

01:12:18.140 --> 01:12:19.778
- You're not going?
- No.

01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.379
You stay out of this.

01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:23.815
All right, you asked for it.

01:12:24.020 --> 01:12:25.612
- Officer O'Hara?
- Coming.

01:12:26.460 --> 01:12:28.849
If you tell O'Hara
what's in the windowseat...

01:12:28.940 --> 01:12:30.931
...I'll tell him what's in the cellar.

01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:31.975
Cellar?

01:12:32.260 --> 01:12:35.855
There's an elderly gentleman down there
who seems to be very dead.

01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.974
- What were you doing there?
- What's he doing there?

01:12:40.060 --> 01:12:42.335
Now what are you going to tell O'Hara?

01:12:42.660 --> 01:12:45.891
Your aunts want to hear the rest.
Shall I bring them in here?

01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:48.580
You can't do that now.
You'd better ring in.

01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:51.453
The heck with ringing in!
I want to tell you the plot.

01:12:51.540 --> 01:12:53.895
You can't tell me
in front of those two fellas.

01:12:53.980 --> 01:12:55.015
Lowbrows, huh?

01:12:55.140 --> 01:12:58.450
Let's go where we can be alone.
I'll meet you there later.

01:12:58.580 --> 01:13:00.855
How about the backroom at Kelly's?

01:13:00.980 --> 01:13:03.972
Fine place. Bohemian atmosphere.
Genius at work.

01:13:04.060 --> 01:13:05.971
You ring in and I'll meet you at Kelly's.

01:13:06.100 --> 01:13:08.295
Why don't you both go down in the cellar?

01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:10.211
That's all right with me.

01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:13.491
There's a much more literary atmosphere
in Kelly's, I assure you.

01:13:13.580 --> 01:13:14.854
This opening will kill you.

01:13:14.940 --> 01:13:17.056
I'm waiting to be born and the doctor...

01:13:17.140 --> 01:13:18.289
The doctor!

01:13:18.420 --> 01:13:20.854
Look, you ring in and I'll see you later.

01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:23.858
You won't stand me up, will you?
This is a great play.

01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.931
- I'll see you down there.
- Can't wait!

01:13:26.020 --> 01:13:27.214
Doctor, doctor.

01:13:27.380 --> 01:13:29.735
Where are those papers? There they are.

01:13:31.180 --> 01:13:34.855
You're smug, aren't you? You think
you've got it over me. You haven't.

01:13:35.060 --> 01:13:38.894
You think I'm afraid to tell about Spenalzo
because of Hoskins. Well, I'm not!

01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:40.333
The moment I get Spenalzo...

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.651
The moment the doctor signs,
I don't care who knows about Hoskins.

01:13:43.740 --> 01:13:47.016
And you better feel the same way
about Spenalzo. Yes, Spenalzo!

01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.898
- Where are you going?
- To the doctor's. Where do you...

01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:52.733
When I come back,
I expect to find you gone. Wait for me!

01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:55.297
We'll wait for him.

01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.892
Did he look guilty!

01:13:58.580 --> 01:14:01.731
Well, Martha,
I think we can start the services now.

01:14:03.300 --> 01:14:04.892
We thought we heard you leave.

01:14:04.980 --> 01:14:07.938
Perish the thought, dear aunties.
That was just Mortimer.

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.851
And speaking of services...

01:14:09.980 --> 01:14:14.212
...will you make us some coffee
while we take Spenalzo down to the cellar?

01:14:14.860 --> 01:14:17.420
No, Jonathan.
You've got to take him with you!

01:14:17.540 --> 01:14:20.737
There's a friend of Mortimer's downstairs
waiting for him.

01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:24.011
- A friend of Mortimer's?
- Take his feet, Doctor.

01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.219
Mr. Spenalzo and he
will get along fine together.

01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:28.733
They're both dead.

01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:31.252
He must mean Mr. Hoskins.

01:14:31.380 --> 01:14:32.859
Mr. Hoskins?

01:14:37.820 --> 01:14:39.856
You know about what's down there?

01:14:39.980 --> 01:14:43.211
Of course we do.
And he's no friend of Mortimer's.

01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:45.934
- He's one of our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

01:14:46.140 --> 01:14:49.849
Yes. And we won't have
any strangers buried in our cellar.

01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:53.012
- But Mr. Hoskins...
- Mr. Hoskins is no stranger.

01:14:53.140 --> 01:14:55.574
Besides, there's no room for Mr. Spenalzo.

01:14:55.660 --> 01:14:57.491
The cellar's crowded already.

01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:59.013
Crowded? With what?

01:14:59.140 --> 01:15:01.734
There are 12 graves down there now.

01:15:07.740 --> 01:15:09.219
Twelve graves.

01:15:09.300 --> 01:15:12.451
That leaves very little room
and we're going to need it.

01:15:12.780 --> 01:15:15.374
You mean, you and Aunt Martha
have murdered 12...

01:15:15.500 --> 01:15:18.617
Murdered? Certainly not.
It's one of our charities.

01:15:18.700 --> 01:15:21.419
Why, what we've been doing is a mercy.

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:25.692
So you just take your Mr. Spenalzo
out of here.

01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:32.456
You've done all that...

01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:36.774
...right here in this house
and buried them in the cellar?

01:15:38.140 --> 01:15:40.574
That's wonderful, Johnny!

01:15:40.860 --> 01:15:43.090
We've been chased all over the world...

01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:47.139
...and they stay right here in Brooklyn,
and they do just as good as you do.

01:15:47.260 --> 01:15:48.295
What?

01:15:49.660 --> 01:15:51.810
You got 12, they got 12.

01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:53.415
I've got 13.

01:15:53.620 --> 01:15:56.817
- No, Johnny, 12. Don't brag.
- Thirteen.

01:15:57.060 --> 01:16:00.496
There's Mr. Spenalzo.
Then the first one in London.

01:16:00.700 --> 01:16:03.498
Two in Johannesburg, one in Sydney,
one in Melbourne...

01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:06.219
...two in San Francisco,
one in Phoenix, Arizona.

01:16:06.300 --> 01:16:07.289
Phoenix?

01:16:07.540 --> 01:16:09.929
- The filling station.
- Filling...

01:16:10.060 --> 01:16:12.893
Three in Chicago and one in South Bend.

01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:14.374
That makes 13.

01:16:14.460 --> 01:16:17.770
You cannot count the one in South Bend.
He died of pneumonia.

01:16:17.860 --> 01:16:20.693
He wouldn't have died of pneumonia
if I hadn't shot him.

01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:22.771
You cannot count him.

01:16:23.100 --> 01:16:25.455
You got 12, they got 12.

01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.890
The old ladies is just as good as you are.

01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:33.651
They are, are they?

01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:37.134
Well, that's easily taken care of.

01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.774
All I need is one more.

01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:42.733
That's all. Just one more.

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:47.490
And I've a pretty good idea who it is.

01:16:48.100 --> 01:16:51.217
I'm a lucky man to have caught you
at home, Dr. Gilchrist.

01:16:51.300 --> 01:16:52.972
This is most irregular.

01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.695
I'm sorry to have dragged you out of bed,
but only you can help me.

01:16:56.780 --> 01:17:00.329
I know Teddy blows bugles,
but I can't commit a man just on that.

01:17:00.460 --> 01:17:01.813
If you'd talk with him...

01:17:01.900 --> 01:17:04.698
...I'm sure you'd be convinced.
Here's the house I...

01:17:07.180 --> 01:17:08.932
- There goes Hoskins.
- Who?

01:17:09.060 --> 01:17:10.937
What? Did I say...

01:17:12.940 --> 01:17:14.373
- You better wait.
- Here?

01:17:14.460 --> 01:17:15.688
I'll bring Teddy out.

01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:18.658
I wouldn't want to alarm the old ladies,
seeing a doctor.

01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:20.890
- You wait here.
- In the cemetery?

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:22.294
It's Halloween.

01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.655
The pixies won't be out till after midnight.

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.415
Make yourself comfortable.
Pull up a tombstone. I'll be right back.

01:17:28.940 --> 01:17:30.498
- Hey, $22.50!
- What?

01:17:30.620 --> 01:17:31.609
$22.50!

01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:33.935
Oh, yes, looks good on you!

01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:36.332
Not the suit, the meter!

01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.498
"Looks good on me".
$22.50.

01:17:44.420 --> 01:17:47.492
- Did you give him a 21-gun salute?
- Yes, with a Maxim silencer.

01:17:47.580 --> 01:17:49.616
Five more bucks and you'll own it.

01:17:49.700 --> 01:17:51.895
No, thanks. It wouldn't fit me.

01:17:53.660 --> 01:17:56.572
- Mr. President, may I present...
- Dr. Livingstone!

01:17:56.660 --> 01:17:59.697
- Livingstone?
- That's what he presumes.

01:17:59.820 --> 01:18:02.539
The doctor would like
to have a few words with you.

01:18:02.620 --> 01:18:05.498
Certainly. Welcome to Washington.

01:18:05.660 --> 01:18:08.413
Arlington is beautiful
at this time of year, is it not?

01:18:08.500 --> 01:18:09.853
Yes, indeed.

01:18:14.940 --> 01:18:17.215
Well now, that's that.

01:18:17.420 --> 01:18:19.411
It gives me a chance to rest.

01:18:23.140 --> 01:18:24.459
So far, so good.

01:18:27.180 --> 01:18:28.454
Not so good.

01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:36.251
Do you or do you not love me?

01:18:38.060 --> 01:18:41.575
How can you say such a thing?
Darling, of course I love you.

01:18:41.660 --> 01:18:43.332
- Do you?
- Yes, darling.

01:18:43.460 --> 01:18:46.816
Then why have you been treating me
the way you have?

01:18:49.740 --> 01:18:53.574
Darling, I love you so much,
I can't go through with our marriage.

01:18:55.860 --> 01:18:57.418
Have you suddenly gone crazy?

01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:00.219
I don't think so,
but it's only a matter of time.

01:19:00.300 --> 01:19:03.815
Darling, would you want to have children
with three heads?

01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.779
You wouldn't want to set up housekeeping
in a padded cell.

01:19:07.940 --> 01:19:10.977
- What are you talking about?
- Well, I don't quite know.

01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.490
I probably should have told you this before,
but you see...

01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:17.731
...well, insanity runs in my family.

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.811
It practically gallops.

01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.134
Just because Teddy's strange,
that doesn't mean...

01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:27.654
No, darling. It's way back before Teddy.

01:19:27.860 --> 01:19:31.535
This goes back to the first Brewster
who came over on the Mayflower.

01:19:31.820 --> 01:19:35.654
You know how in those days
the Indians used to scalp the settlers?

01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:38.136
He used to scalp the Indians.

01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:40.732
Darling, that's ancient history.

01:19:40.820 --> 01:19:44.290
Doctor, I'll run for a third term,
but I won't be elected.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:47.213
That'll mean the last of the Roosevelts
in the White House.

01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.656
- That's what you think.
- Of course, if the country insists...

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:52.935
Darling, all this doesn't prove a thing.

01:19:53.020 --> 01:19:55.898
Look at your aunts.
They're Brewsters, aren't they?

01:19:55.980 --> 01:19:58.653
They're the sweetest,
sanest people I've ever known.

01:20:01.060 --> 01:20:03.858
Well, even they have their peculiarities.

01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:06.818
What of it? So your family's crazy.
So you're crazy.

01:20:06.900 --> 01:20:08.697
That's the way I love you.

01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:11.369
I'm crazy too, but kiss me.

01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:13.258
No, no. I...

01:20:16.820 --> 01:20:20.096
Goodbye, Ambassador.
I've enjoyed this little talk very much.

01:20:20.180 --> 01:20:23.570
Anytime you're in Washington,
drop in to see me at the White House.

01:20:29.340 --> 01:20:32.013
- Those papers.
- Go away. Papers!

01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:34.614
- I'll commit him to any place.
- You will?

01:20:34.700 --> 01:20:36.930
I've just been appointed
Ambassador to Bolivia!

01:20:37.020 --> 01:20:39.614
You see? Didn't I tell you?

01:20:39.700 --> 01:20:42.772
Don't worry about that.
Just go on signing the papers.

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:44.889
Thank you.

01:20:47.060 --> 01:20:50.735
All right! We'll find out
whose house this is!

01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:53.454
I'm warning you, you better stop it.

01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:56.976
There's no use doing what you're doing.
It'll just have to be undone.

01:20:57.060 --> 01:20:58.698
Aunt Abby, go to bed!

01:20:58.820 --> 01:21:02.733
It's a terrible thing to do to bury
a good Methodist with a foreigner.

01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:04.219
Where have you been?

01:21:04.300 --> 01:21:06.860
Getting some papers signed.
Is Teddy in his room?

01:21:06.940 --> 01:21:08.658
What is the matter with you?

01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.652
Running around getting papers signed
at a time like this.

01:21:11.740 --> 01:21:13.856
Martha and I are going for the police.

01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.895
Police!

01:21:15.620 --> 01:21:16.769
Wait!

01:21:16.860 --> 01:21:19.169
- You can't go for the police.
- Oh, no?

01:21:19.300 --> 01:21:20.972
You know what Jonathan's doing?

01:21:21.060 --> 01:21:23.938
He's putting Mr. Hoskins
and Mr. Spenalzo in together.

01:21:24.020 --> 01:21:25.248
All right, let him.

01:21:25.340 --> 01:21:27.979
This is all fixed up nice now.

01:21:28.180 --> 01:21:30.535
Nice and smooth like a lake.

01:21:30.700 --> 01:21:34.693
The President will be very proud
of his Panama Canal.

01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:38.616
Bed feels good already.

01:21:38.700 --> 01:21:42.249
You know, we didn't get any sleep
for 48 hours.

01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:44.098
You're forgetting, Doctor.

01:21:45.340 --> 01:21:48.616
If Jonathan and Mr. Spenalzo
aren't out this house before morning...

01:21:48.700 --> 01:21:50.452
...we're going for the police.

01:21:50.540 --> 01:21:52.178
I'll get them out, I promise!

01:21:52.260 --> 01:21:56.173
- Then you get the wedding silver.
- Remember, no police! No police!

01:21:56.660 --> 01:21:58.571
Look, go to bed, will you?

01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:02.170
Get out of those clothes!
You look like a double blackout.

01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:04.695
My brother, Mortimer.

01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.698
I just heard him upstairs.

01:22:07.340 --> 01:22:09.774
No! I am tired.

01:22:09.860 --> 01:22:14.138
You forget, I got to operate
on your face tomorrow.

01:22:14.340 --> 01:22:17.138
You are going to operate tomorrow,
Doctor.

01:22:17.300 --> 01:22:19.973
But tonight we are taking care
of Mortimer.

01:22:20.100 --> 01:22:23.137
But Johnny, not tonight! I'm sleepy.

01:22:23.220 --> 01:22:25.654
We'll do it tomorrow. Or the next day.

01:22:26.020 --> 01:22:27.931
Look at me, Doctor.

01:22:28.780 --> 01:22:32.489
You can see that it's got to be done,
can't you?

01:22:32.740 --> 01:22:36.210
Yeah, I know that look.

01:22:36.420 --> 01:22:39.696
It's a little late to dissolve our partnership.

01:22:39.900 --> 01:22:42.289
Okay, Johnny. Okay, we'll do it.

01:22:42.420 --> 01:22:45.617
But the quick way, huh?
The quick twist like in London.

01:22:45.820 --> 01:22:49.779
No, Doctor. I think this calls
for something special.

01:22:50.460 --> 01:22:53.850
I think, perhaps, the Melbourne method.

01:22:54.020 --> 01:22:56.693
Not the Melbourne method, please!

01:22:56.820 --> 01:22:58.492
Two hours!

01:22:58.660 --> 01:23:01.015
And then when it was all over, what?

01:23:01.220 --> 01:23:04.974
The fellow in London was just as dead
as the fellow in Melbourne.

01:23:06.700 --> 01:23:08.292
Don't do that, Mr. President.

01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:11.258
But I cannot sign anything
without consulting my Cabinet.

01:23:11.340 --> 01:23:12.568
This must be secret.

01:23:12.660 --> 01:23:15.299
A secret proclamation? How unusual.

01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:18.333
Yes, it's the only way
we can outsmart the other fellow.

01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.650
- Who's the other fellow?
- That's the secret.

01:23:20.740 --> 01:23:22.492
Oh, I see!

01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.248
Very clever.

01:23:24.580 --> 01:23:27.094
A secret proclamation
has to be signed in secret.

01:23:27.180 --> 01:23:30.138
- Of course, Mr. President.
- I'll put on my signing clothes.

01:23:30.220 --> 01:23:32.336
You already have them on, Mr. President.

01:23:32.420 --> 01:23:34.650
So I have. Wait here.

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:39.936
Hey, Mr. Brewster.

01:23:40.060 --> 01:23:41.573
What is it, mice?

01:23:44.660 --> 01:23:47.572
- You get out of this house.
- Can't you see I'm busy?

01:23:56.220 --> 01:23:57.892
Thank you, Mr. President.

01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:01.099
What a load off my mind.
Boy, could I use a drink!

01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.729
- Get out of here, will you, please?
- What? Speak up. I can't hear you.

01:24:04.820 --> 01:24:06.617
Johnny's in a bad mood. Get out!

01:24:06.700 --> 01:24:10.056
- Stop underplaying. I can't hear you.
- Please listen to me. Get out.

01:24:10.140 --> 01:24:13.735
Stop all this! What are you doing?
Look, Doc... Are you really a doctor?

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:15.617
Yes, Heidelberg, 1919.

01:24:15.740 --> 01:24:18.300
Heidelberg?
How'd you hook up with Jonathan?

01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:22.299
I tell you later about that, but you go now.
Please listen to me.

01:24:23.260 --> 01:24:24.579
Stop it, Doctor!

01:24:24.660 --> 01:24:27.538
You get out of here!
Look, when Johnny's in that mood...

01:24:27.620 --> 01:24:29.815
...he's a madman. He's a maniac!

01:24:30.020 --> 01:24:32.978
And then things happen. Horrible things.

01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:35.255
- Get out of here!
- Will you stop it?

01:24:35.340 --> 01:24:37.934
Stop telling me about Jonathan,
I'll take care of him.

01:24:38.020 --> 01:24:40.818
You take care of yourself.
Get going, little fellow.

01:24:40.900 --> 01:24:42.936
- What's that? Wait.
- My schnapps.

01:24:43.020 --> 01:24:45.488
- I could use that.
- That's mine.

01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:48.730
Please. Only for dramatic critics.

01:24:48.820 --> 01:24:51.539
You beat it before things start popping
around here.

01:24:51.620 --> 01:24:53.690
But, look, Mr. Brewster, please.

01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:55.338
You've just been married.

01:24:55.420 --> 01:24:58.810
You have a nice little wife waiting for you.
Please go now.

01:24:59.060 --> 01:25:00.254
Please.

01:25:04.300 --> 01:25:06.973
Don't those plays you see all the time
teach you anything?

01:25:07.260 --> 01:25:10.809
Don't get me on the subject of plays!
I've got to wait for Mr. Witherspoon.

01:25:10.900 --> 01:25:13.334
At least people in plays
act like they got sense.

01:25:13.420 --> 01:25:16.218
Did anybody in a play
ever act like they got intelligence?

01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:19.451
- How can somebody be so stupid?
- You ought to have my job.

01:25:19.580 --> 01:25:23.539
When you get out of prison, have yourself
wheeled to the Garrick Theater.

01:25:23.860 --> 01:25:27.170
There's a play that's so bad,
it'll still be running when you get out.

01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:29.057
There's a man... Now listen to this.

01:25:29.140 --> 01:25:32.576
He knows he's in the house with murderers
and should know he's in danger.

01:25:32.660 --> 01:25:35.049
He's even been warned to get out.
And does he go?

01:25:35.140 --> 01:25:36.858
No, he doesn't. He stays!

01:25:37.140 --> 01:25:41.531
This fellow doesn't even have sense
to be scared or to be on his guard.

01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.696
The murderer even invites him to sit down.

01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:45.691
- What do you think he does?
- I don't know.

01:25:45.780 --> 01:25:47.418
He sits down!

01:25:47.500 --> 01:25:50.617
He deliberately pulls up a chair
and he sits down in it.

01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:52.173
Isn't that great?

01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:56.330
So there he is,
all waiting to be trussed up and gagged.

01:25:57.100 --> 01:26:00.888
What do you think they tied him up with?
The curtain cord.

01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:03.254
Curtain cord?

01:26:03.740 --> 01:26:05.617
But didn't he see him get it?

01:26:05.700 --> 01:26:08.772
No. The silly chump sits down
with his back toward the murderer.

01:26:08.860 --> 01:26:11.658
All he has to do is look around,
but does he? No!

01:26:13.020 --> 01:26:16.456
See, brother Heidelberg,
in a play or even in a movie...

01:26:16.700 --> 01:26:20.249
...a fellow never sees or hears anything.
That's right.

01:26:20.340 --> 01:26:21.773
But what does he do?

01:26:22.020 --> 01:26:25.649
The big chump sits there.
This fellow's supposed to be bright.

01:26:25.740 --> 01:26:28.891
Now get a load of this.
Look at the attitude.

01:26:29.220 --> 01:26:32.849
Large as life! He sits there
waiting to be tied up and gagged.

01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:34.739
The big dope!

01:26:43.500 --> 01:26:47.209
You were right about that fellow.
He wasn't very bright.

01:26:48.420 --> 01:26:49.853
Yes, Mortimer.

01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.414
I've been away for 20 years.

01:26:53.700 --> 01:26:56.851
But never, my dear brother,
were you out of my mind.

01:26:59.220 --> 01:27:02.451
In Melbourne one night, I dreamt of you.

01:27:24.300 --> 01:27:28.009
The more you struggle
the more you strangle yourself.

01:27:30.700 --> 01:27:33.373
Later on, you may consider that a blessing.

01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:06.814
Now, Doctor...

01:28:08.620 --> 01:28:10.133
...we go to work.

01:28:10.220 --> 01:28:12.575
Johnny, for me, the quick way. Please.

01:28:13.620 --> 01:28:16.373
- This must be an artistic achievement.
- Please.

01:28:16.580 --> 01:28:20.129
After all, we're performing
before a very distinguished critic.

01:28:20.980 --> 01:28:22.015
Please!

01:28:22.780 --> 01:28:26.090
All right. Let's get it over with.

01:28:26.980 --> 01:28:30.370
But I cannot see this without the drink.

01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:32.819
Pull yourself together.

01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:36.688
But I can't pull myself together
without a drink.

01:28:36.780 --> 01:28:39.613
You remember when we came in,
there was some wine.

01:28:39.700 --> 01:28:42.533
And then they took it.
Where did they put it?

01:28:43.940 --> 01:28:45.851
I found some wine.

01:28:47.300 --> 01:28:49.291
Here, I'll split it with you.

01:28:49.380 --> 01:28:51.974
We both have a drink before we operate.

01:28:52.220 --> 01:28:56.611
I am so happy that we don't have
to operate without a drink.

01:29:03.140 --> 01:29:04.539
One moment, please.

01:29:05.380 --> 01:29:07.177
Where are your manners?

01:29:09.820 --> 01:29:11.299
Yes, Mortimer.

01:29:11.540 --> 01:29:15.419
I realize now that it was you
who brought me back to Brooklyn.

01:29:15.500 --> 01:29:16.899
We drink to you.

01:29:18.220 --> 01:29:20.131
To my dear, dead brother.

01:29:37.220 --> 01:29:38.255
That idiot!

01:29:38.340 --> 01:29:41.855
- He goes next. That's all. He goes next!
- Not Teddy! Please!

01:29:41.980 --> 01:29:44.494
- We'll get to him later.
- You won't at all!

01:29:44.660 --> 01:29:46.537
We have to work fast. The quick way.

01:29:46.620 --> 01:29:48.133
The quick way, yes!

01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:51.451
If it has to be, then the quick way.
I'll help you.

01:30:05.620 --> 01:30:07.736
The colonel has to quit blowing that horn.

01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:10.778
It's all right. We're taking
the bugle away from him.

01:30:10.860 --> 01:30:13.818
I'd better talk to him myself.
Where's the lights?

01:30:20.020 --> 01:30:21.692
You stood me up!

01:30:22.260 --> 01:30:25.172
I've been waiting for you
for over an hour at Kelly's.

01:30:26.140 --> 01:30:28.096
- What happened to him?
- Nothing.

01:30:28.260 --> 01:30:33.254
He was explaining a play he saw and
that's what happened to a man in the play.

01:30:33.940 --> 01:30:34.850
I see.

01:30:35.380 --> 01:30:37.450
Did that really happen in a play you saw?

01:30:37.820 --> 01:30:40.129
How do you like that?
You can't trust nobody.

01:30:40.220 --> 01:30:42.654
They practically stole that from my play.

01:30:42.980 --> 01:30:46.689
In the second act, just...
Maybe I'd better start at the beginning.

01:30:48.660 --> 01:30:50.013
Yeah, sure.

01:30:55.620 --> 01:30:58.088
You've got to hear the plot!

01:31:01.220 --> 01:31:04.929
My mother's making up.
Like a flash, out of a clear sky...

01:31:05.060 --> 01:31:07.654
...the door opens and a man
with a mustache comes in.

01:31:07.740 --> 01:31:11.369
He says, "Miss Peaches La Tour,
will you marry me?"

01:31:12.220 --> 01:31:16.930
That's the first scene. My mother doesn't
say they're married. That's the surprise!

01:31:17.060 --> 01:31:18.334
What a kick!

01:31:18.780 --> 01:31:22.250
Twenty-five years pass.
Well, in the meantime, there's me.

01:31:22.420 --> 01:31:25.776
Growing into a magnificent specimen.
So what do I do?

01:31:25.860 --> 01:31:29.057
I join the police force and become
one of New York's finest.

01:31:29.140 --> 01:31:32.576
I'm cleaning out a crooked laundry, see?
Little do I know it...

01:31:32.700 --> 01:31:35.089
...but a dope fiend with a knife is after me.

01:31:35.180 --> 01:31:36.659
I'm in great danger.

01:31:38.020 --> 01:31:41.012
It's getting you, ain't it?
I can see it in your eyes.

01:31:42.460 --> 01:31:44.257
You ain't heard nothing yet.

01:31:44.380 --> 01:31:47.452
All of a sudden, a fire breaks out.
What an effect!

01:31:47.540 --> 01:31:49.849
Firemen rush in and who's leading them?

01:31:50.100 --> 01:31:52.136
Mayor Fiorello La Guardia!

01:31:54.820 --> 01:31:56.299
What's the matter with him?

01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:58.974
- Probably your play put him to sleep.
- What?

01:31:59.060 --> 01:32:02.973
- I personally like it very much.
- It's probably over his head.

01:32:03.300 --> 01:32:06.178
- Where have I seen that face before?
- No, please.

01:32:08.300 --> 01:32:11.212
The scene changes. It's an evolving stage.

01:32:11.460 --> 01:32:13.655
I'm walking along my beat, casual-like...

01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:17.289
...when a guy that I'm following,
it turns out he's following me!

01:32:17.620 --> 01:32:20.373
Don't let nobody in.
I figures I'll outsmart him.

01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:23.810
- There's a vacant house on the corner.
- Johnny, the cops!

01:32:23.900 --> 01:32:26.619
I sees the door handle turn,
so I pulls out my gun...

01:32:26.700 --> 01:32:29.055
...braces myself against the wall and I says:

01:32:29.140 --> 01:32:30.129
"Come in! "

01:32:34.100 --> 01:32:35.499
Hello, boys.

01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:39.535
- What the Sam Hill's going on?
- Sarge, this is Mortimer Brewster.

01:32:39.620 --> 01:32:42.817
- He's going to help me write my play.
- Do you have to tie him up?

01:32:42.900 --> 01:32:46.734
Report in. Why didn't you ring in?
The whole force is out looking for you.

01:32:46.820 --> 01:32:49.812
Right in the middle of the second act.
Did they send you here?

01:32:49.900 --> 01:32:52.255
No, we came to warn the old ladies.

01:32:52.340 --> 01:32:54.695
- The colonel blew that bugle again.
- I heard him.

01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:57.613
The neighbors are phoning in.
The Lieutenant's on the warpath.

01:32:57.700 --> 01:32:59.975
He says we've got
to put him away someplace.

01:33:00.300 --> 01:33:01.779
Now, who the heck is this?

01:33:01.860 --> 01:33:04.533
Mr. Brewster's brother.
My play put him to sleep.

01:33:04.620 --> 01:33:07.532
That's the one that ran away.
So he came back.

01:33:07.780 --> 01:33:09.259
Brophy. Get me Mac.

01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:12.856
Have you got yourself in a mess!
You're two hours overdue at the station.

01:33:13.140 --> 01:33:15.335
I better let them know that I found you.

01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:17.138
It wasn't that bad, was it?

01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:22.299
Tell the Lieutenant he can call off
the big manhunt. We found him.

01:33:22.580 --> 01:33:24.969
At the Brewster house.

01:33:25.060 --> 01:33:27.176
Shall we bring him in?

01:33:27.380 --> 01:33:29.610
All right, we'll hold him right here.

01:33:31.260 --> 01:33:33.728
The Lieutenant is on his way over.

01:33:34.140 --> 01:33:36.654
So I've been turned in?

01:33:37.220 --> 01:33:39.780
All right, you've got me.

01:33:40.620 --> 01:33:44.659
I suppose you and my stool-pigeon brother
will split the reward.

01:33:44.780 --> 01:33:45.895
Yes, reward!

01:33:45.980 --> 01:33:47.811
Now I'll do some turning in!

01:33:47.940 --> 01:33:49.532
Wait a minute, Mr. Brewster.

01:33:49.620 --> 01:33:53.010
You think my aunts are sweet,
charming old ladies, don't you?

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:56.251
Well, there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar!

01:33:56.740 --> 01:33:57.695
Yes, 13.

01:33:57.780 --> 01:34:00.533
Be careful what you say.
Your aunts are friends of ours.

01:34:00.620 --> 01:34:03.532
- I'll show them to you.
- Don't make trouble for them!

01:34:03.620 --> 01:34:06.054
Never mind, Mr. Brewster.
Leave him to me.

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:08.210
- Come down to the cellar.
- Wait a minute.

01:34:08.300 --> 01:34:11.053
Thirteen bodies.
I'll show you where they're buried.

01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:14.094
- Go to the cellar with him.
- Yes, come to the cellar.

01:34:14.180 --> 01:34:15.818
Well, look, do I have to?

01:34:16.940 --> 01:34:19.170
Maybe I don't want to go down
to the cellar.

01:34:19.260 --> 01:34:21.296
Go on down the cellar with him!

01:34:21.380 --> 01:34:24.611
Now, please. I'll tell you
the rest of my play later.

01:34:25.180 --> 01:34:27.819
- Go on down the cellar with him.
- Do I have to?

01:34:27.940 --> 01:34:30.408
Look at that puss.
He looks like Boris Karloff.

01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:31.694
Don't! Sarge!

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:39.619
Look out, Pat!

01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:46.616
- Look out!
- He's got a gun.

01:34:47.220 --> 01:34:49.495
I got him, Pat. Look out!

01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:51.737
Fight. Go on and fight.

01:34:56.260 --> 01:34:59.138
That's enough, that's enough.
Everybody off.

01:35:02.340 --> 01:35:03.409
Pat, look out!

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.615
Amazing.

01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.529
Such a fine day, too.

01:35:12.620 --> 01:35:16.454
All I did was cross the bridge
and I was in Brooklyn. Amazing.

01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:23.339
Don't bother me now.

01:35:23.420 --> 01:35:25.376
You could use this in the third act.

01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:27.928
I got something better. Let me tell you...

01:35:28.580 --> 01:35:29.979
I'll see you later.

01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:36.298
The papers are all signed. What do I care?

01:35:36.620 --> 01:35:38.099
Go ahead, fight.

01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.213
I'd better call and see
if Witherspoon has left.

01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.289
Telephone.

01:35:50.380 --> 01:35:51.938
I'll get every one of you!

01:35:52.020 --> 01:35:55.012
I hate cops. I'll brain the first one
that comes near me!

01:35:55.100 --> 01:35:58.137
A little higher, brother.
Thank you very much. That's fine.

01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:00.133
Don't do that, please.

01:36:00.220 --> 01:36:01.414
Get him, Pat.

01:36:01.860 --> 01:36:04.499
That won't have any effect.
I've tried it before...

01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:05.854
It did. Isn't that amazing?

01:36:08.300 --> 01:36:11.019
Oh, dear. Wish I could relax like that.

01:36:12.740 --> 01:36:14.298
- Witherspoon.
- Come in.

01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.858
What has occurred?

01:36:29.940 --> 01:36:32.534
Never mind!
Didn't I tell you I'd handle this?

01:36:32.780 --> 01:36:34.008
Well, Lieutenant!

01:36:34.100 --> 01:36:37.695
- We were just acting in self-defense.
- What happened? He put up a fight?

01:36:37.780 --> 01:36:40.010
This isn't the one who blows the bugle.

01:36:40.100 --> 01:36:44.537
- This is his brother who tried to kill O'Hara.
- All I said was he looked like Boris Karloff.

01:36:44.620 --> 01:36:46.497
Boris... Turn him over.

01:36:50.180 --> 01:36:52.535
Kind of think he's wanted somewhere.

01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:55.288
You "kind of think
he's wanted somewhere"?

01:36:55.540 --> 01:36:58.577
If you guys can't look
at the circulars we put up...

01:36:58.820 --> 01:37:01.129
...you can at least read
short detective stories.

01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.211
Certainly, he's wanted. In Indiana!

01:37:03.300 --> 01:37:06.610
He escaped from the prison
for criminally insane. He's a lifer.

01:37:06.700 --> 01:37:07.894
That's my brother.

01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:11.814
That's the way they described him.
"He looked like Karloff".

01:37:12.300 --> 01:37:13.653
Why'd you knock him out?

01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.971
He tried to get us to go to the cellar.
He says 13 bodies are there.

01:37:17.060 --> 01:37:18.493
Thirteen bodies in the cellar...

01:37:18.580 --> 01:37:21.572
...and that don't tip you off
the guy's from a nuthouse?

01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:22.809
Thanks, pal.

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.737
About my not ringing in, I want to...

01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:27.254
Where have you been all night?
Don't tell me.

01:37:27.340 --> 01:37:30.730
I was right here writing a play
with Mortimer Brewster.

01:37:30.860 --> 01:37:33.579
You're going to have
a long time on that play.

01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:35.173
You're suspended.

01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:36.898
Now go on. Report in.

01:37:36.980 --> 01:37:39.972
Bring him to and find out
where his accomplice is.

01:37:40.060 --> 01:37:42.449
The guy who helped him escape.
He's wanted, too.

01:37:42.540 --> 01:37:43.529
Here.

01:37:43.820 --> 01:37:46.971
I've been after these guys for 48 hours.
Nothing to eat. No sleep.

01:37:47.140 --> 01:37:49.017
No wonder Brooklyn's in the shape it's in.

01:37:49.100 --> 01:37:52.490
With flatheads like you on the force.
Falling for a story like that!

01:37:52.580 --> 01:37:54.616
Thirteen bodies buried in the cellar.

01:37:54.780 --> 01:37:57.055
But there are 13 bodies in the cellar!

01:37:58.020 --> 01:38:00.488
- Who are you?
- I'm President Roosevelt.

01:38:02.180 --> 01:38:05.650
- What the blazes is this?
- He's the one that blows the bugle.

01:38:05.940 --> 01:38:07.453
Howdy, Colonel.

01:38:11.020 --> 01:38:14.376
Colonel, you've blown your last bugle.
Get this guy out of here.

01:38:14.580 --> 01:38:16.855
Dear me! Another yellow-fever victim?

01:38:17.300 --> 01:38:19.814
All the bodies in the cellar
are yellow-fever victims.

01:38:19.900 --> 01:38:23.176
No, Colonel. This is a spy.
We caught him at the White House.

01:38:23.260 --> 01:38:25.728
Take him out and bring him to.
I want to question him.

01:38:25.820 --> 01:38:29.335
- Questioning of spies is my department.
- Hey, you, keep out of that.

01:38:29.660 --> 01:38:33.573
You're forgetting that as President
I am also head of the Secret Service.

01:38:43.540 --> 01:38:44.655
Who are you?

01:38:45.180 --> 01:38:46.329
What's your name?

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:49.218
Usually, I'm Mortimer Brewster.
But I'm not myself today.

01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:53.179
You're his brother. Look, no argument.
He's got to be put away.

01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:57.816
No arguments, Captain. No arguments.
Just a minute, take it easy. Read this.

01:38:57.900 --> 01:38:59.777
Teddy's going to go to Happy Dale tonight.

01:38:59.860 --> 01:39:03.057
- I'm waiting for Mr. Witherspoon.
- As long as he's going someplace.

01:39:03.140 --> 01:39:05.256
He's scaring the neighbors with that bugle.

01:39:05.340 --> 01:39:08.650
And that cockeyed story
about 13 bodies being...

01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:20.216
I've been without sleep for 48 hours.
I'm liable to think anything.

01:39:20.300 --> 01:39:22.211
I know just how you feel.

01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.530
There's people dumb enough
to believe that.

01:39:24.620 --> 01:39:27.692
Last year there was a crazy guy,
started a murder rumor.

01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:30.380
I had to dig up a half acre plot
before I could prove...

01:39:30.460 --> 01:39:32.337
- What's this?
- What's the matter?

01:39:32.420 --> 01:39:34.138
- These papers aren't any good.
- Why not?

01:39:34.220 --> 01:39:36.688
He signed it Theodore Roosevelt!

01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:44.731
- Is your taxi engaged?
- Losing dough every minute. Any offers?

01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:48.853
I'm Mr. Witherspoon of Happy Dale
Sanitarium, I have come to get a Brewster.

01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:51.977
I would like you to drive us back
to the sanitarium.

01:39:53.220 --> 01:39:55.814
I knew this would end up in a nuthouse!

01:39:57.260 --> 01:40:00.297
We like to think of it as a rest home.

01:40:10.780 --> 01:40:11.895
Mr. Brewster?

01:40:15.460 --> 01:40:17.212
Mr. Witherspoon is here.

01:40:20.860 --> 01:40:24.648
Supposing the spy steals this document
and finds the name Roosevelt on it.

01:40:24.780 --> 01:40:27.738
Think what that would mean
to the safety of the nation!

01:40:27.820 --> 01:40:30.288
- No, it's chicanery.
- What is this? Come on!

01:40:30.380 --> 01:40:33.497
- He's come to. He's ready to talk.
- Hold him till I get there.

01:40:33.580 --> 01:40:37.095
Let me explain. The name Brewster
is code for Roosevelt.

01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:39.695
- Code for Roosevelt?
- Take the name Brewster.

01:40:39.780 --> 01:40:41.850
Take away the "B" and what have you got?

01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:44.215
- Rooster.
- And what does a rooster do?

01:40:44.300 --> 01:40:47.610
- Crows.
- It crows! Where do you hunt in Africa?

01:40:47.780 --> 01:40:49.975
- On the veldt!
- There you are! "Crowsveldt".

01:40:50.060 --> 01:40:53.257
Ingenious! My compliments
to the boys in the code department.

01:40:53.340 --> 01:40:55.410
That's all right! Do that again for me.

01:40:55.500 --> 01:40:58.014
Never mind! Give me that pen.

01:40:58.780 --> 01:41:00.293
This is fun.

01:41:00.660 --> 01:41:02.969
Now, all I got to get is Witherspoon.

01:41:09.540 --> 01:41:11.292
I'm so glad to see you.

01:41:13.220 --> 01:41:15.017
You will take good care of Teddy?

01:41:15.100 --> 01:41:17.375
- Best of care of him.
- That's fine.

01:41:17.500 --> 01:41:19.252
And no wagon when he leaves.

01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:21.376
Why? To take him away? Never, never.

01:41:21.460 --> 01:41:24.179
Taxicabs. We always...
I have one waiting now.

01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:25.813
It means a great deal to me.

01:41:25.900 --> 01:41:28.858
You will personally see
that Teddy's happy at Happy Dale?

01:41:28.940 --> 01:41:31.295
- He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.
- That's good.

01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:34.372
You know, I sometimes envy
some of our patients, secretly.

01:41:34.460 --> 01:41:37.577
You do? It must be a nice place.
I've never been there.

01:41:37.660 --> 01:41:39.571
You never can tell.

01:41:39.940 --> 01:41:42.818
This is a particularly happy moment
for me tonight.

01:41:42.900 --> 01:41:46.688
- I've never met a dramatic critic before.
- The woods are full of them.

01:41:46.780 --> 01:41:50.216
I have here something that will explain
what we're trying to do.

01:41:50.300 --> 01:41:53.690
- A pamphlet about Happy Dale?
- No, it's a play.

01:41:53.820 --> 01:41:55.492
Something I've been working on.

01:41:55.580 --> 01:41:59.175
It's a dramatization of many incidents
that have happened at Happy Dale.

01:41:59.260 --> 01:42:00.852
Captain! Captain!

01:42:02.140 --> 01:42:06.497
I want you to read this carefully.
I want you to be just as harsh as you like.

01:42:06.580 --> 01:42:07.933
I shan't mind, you know...

01:42:08.020 --> 01:42:10.329
Captain, this is Mr. Witherspoon.

01:42:12.860 --> 01:42:14.737
He'll be very happy at Happy Dale.

01:42:14.820 --> 01:42:16.731
- Come, my boy.
- What is this?

01:42:18.220 --> 01:42:21.451
No, you got it wrong.
This is Captain Rooney.

01:42:21.660 --> 01:42:23.252
The police?

01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:28.533
I'm sure! Here are the papers, all signed.
Now you can take him away.

01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.736
I'll be in my office vetoing some bills.

01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.095
Mr. President, I have good news for you.

01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:35.489
Your term of office is over.

01:42:36.340 --> 01:42:38.774
- Is this March 4?
- Practically.

01:42:38.860 --> 01:42:40.134
Let's see...

01:42:42.340 --> 01:42:44.570
Now I go on my hunting trip to Africa!

01:42:44.700 --> 01:42:47.260
Well, I must get started immediately.

01:42:53.220 --> 01:42:56.337
Is he trying to move into the White House
before I've moved out?

01:42:56.420 --> 01:42:58.172
Who, Mr. President?

01:42:58.260 --> 01:42:59.090
Taft!

01:43:02.220 --> 01:43:07.089
No, this isn't Mr. Taft.
It's Mr. Witherspoon, your guide to Africa.

01:43:07.420 --> 01:43:08.819
Bully! Bully!

01:43:08.980 --> 01:43:11.494
Wait right here.
I'll bring down my equipment.

01:43:11.580 --> 01:43:12.615
Happy man.

01:43:12.860 --> 01:43:14.851
Goodbye, Aunt Abby, Aunt Martha.

01:43:14.940 --> 01:43:17.613
I'm on my way to Africa.
Isn't it wonderful?

01:43:17.700 --> 01:43:18.735
Charge!

01:43:21.380 --> 01:43:23.211
It's all right, I've got it.

01:43:24.260 --> 01:43:25.170
Oh, dear.

01:43:25.660 --> 01:43:28.538
And Happy Dale is full of staircases.

01:43:33.420 --> 01:43:36.059
You've come to meet Teddy, haven't you?

01:43:36.140 --> 01:43:39.815
No, he's come to take him.
Teddy's been blowing his bugle again.

01:43:39.900 --> 01:43:43.051
No, he can't go now! We won't permit it.

01:43:43.180 --> 01:43:45.569
We promise to take his bugle
away from him.

01:43:45.660 --> 01:43:48.891
- We won't be separated from Teddy.
- I'm sorry.

01:43:50.420 --> 01:43:52.536
How can you allow this? You promised.

01:43:52.620 --> 01:43:55.817
Brewster's got nothing to do with this.
The law is the law!

01:43:55.940 --> 01:43:58.454
Teddy's committed himself
and he's got to go.

01:43:59.300 --> 01:44:04.294
- If he's going, we're going, too!
- Yes, you'll have to take us with him.

01:44:05.180 --> 01:44:07.330
Why not? Why not, indeed?

01:44:08.580 --> 01:44:12.732
It's sweet of them, but impossible.
We never take sane people at Happy Dale.

01:44:17.100 --> 01:44:21.252
These little sane people will get lost
in the shuffle. You could arrange that.

01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.218
Just put them in
and they'll get all mixed up.

01:44:24.460 --> 01:44:26.735
Too dangerous. Dissension, jealousy.

01:44:30.220 --> 01:44:32.131
Now, let's be sensible, ladies.

01:44:32.260 --> 01:44:35.491
Here I am wasting my time
when I could be doing some serious work.

01:44:35.580 --> 01:44:37.969
There are still murders
to be solved in Brooklyn.

01:44:38.060 --> 01:44:41.211
It ain't only his bugle blowing.
Things are going to get worse.

01:44:41.300 --> 01:44:43.939
We're liable to have to dig up your cellar.

01:44:44.020 --> 01:44:45.294
Our cellar?

01:44:46.500 --> 01:44:50.015
Teddy's been telling around
there's 13 bodies buried in the cellar.

01:44:50.100 --> 01:44:52.455
There are 13 bodies in our cellar.

01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:58.936
What?

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:02.376
Yes. You just ask our nephew, Mortimer.

01:45:07.380 --> 01:45:08.369
Charge!

01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:15.973
Isn't that amazing?

01:45:17.180 --> 01:45:18.693
You behave yourself.

01:45:18.780 --> 01:45:21.852
You know very well there are
13 bodies down in our cellar.

01:45:21.940 --> 01:45:24.090
Certainly there's 13 bodies in the cellar.

01:45:24.180 --> 01:45:27.889
And there are hundreds more
up in the attic, Captain!

01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:34.330
- What is this?
- You mustn't mind Mortimer.

01:45:34.420 --> 01:45:36.331
- How about it?
- I'll be right there.

01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:38.251
He's been a little strange all day.

01:45:38.340 --> 01:45:41.969
Right now I wouldn't know what is
and what ain't strange anymore.

01:45:42.060 --> 01:45:44.938
- I'll look in that cellar.
- I'll tell you what we'll do.

01:45:45.020 --> 01:45:48.410
I'll bring my bodies from the attic
and you get yours from the cellar...

01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:53.210
...and we'll get them all together,
and we'll send them to Happy Dale.

01:45:55.100 --> 01:45:58.729
No, you wouldn't have to dig.
The graves are all marked.

01:45:59.140 --> 01:46:02.052
- We put flowers on them every Sunday.
- Flowers?

01:46:02.140 --> 01:46:04.654
Sure, I put neon lights on mine.

01:46:06.420 --> 01:46:08.058
Humor them, humor them.

01:46:08.780 --> 01:46:09.735
Smile.

01:46:12.140 --> 01:46:14.415
There's one down there, a Mr. Spenalzo...

01:46:14.500 --> 01:46:15.649
Hasn't got it yet.

01:46:15.740 --> 01:46:18.015
...who doesn't belong here
and has to leave.

01:46:18.100 --> 01:46:21.854
- But the other 12 are our gentlemen.
- Your gentlemen?

01:46:21.940 --> 01:46:24.818
You'd like mine better.
None of mine are gentlemen.

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:28.494
- You mustn't mind him at all.
- He got married today.

01:46:28.580 --> 01:46:31.890
"There is a Happy Dale far, far away

01:46:31.980 --> 01:46:33.936
"There is a Happy"

01:46:38.100 --> 01:46:40.056
He got it. It's amazing.

01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.094
Don't you think you can find room
for the ladies?

01:46:43.180 --> 01:46:44.533
Just the ladies?

01:46:46.100 --> 01:46:47.818
Just the ladies!

01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:51.254
- How about it?
- They'd have to be committed.

01:46:51.940 --> 01:46:53.976
Teddy committed himself. Couldn't they?

01:46:54.060 --> 01:46:56.733
- All they have to do is sign the papers.
- Certainly.

01:46:56.820 --> 01:46:59.857
If we can go with Teddy,
we'll sign the papers.

01:46:59.940 --> 01:47:01.134
Where are they?

01:47:01.220 --> 01:47:03.211
I have them, ladies, right here.

01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:06.412
Sign them up, will you?
I want this all cleaned up.

01:47:06.540 --> 01:47:10.215
I'm going out to talk to that spy.
Maybe I can understand him.

01:47:10.460 --> 01:47:12.337
Thirteen bodies in the cellar.

01:47:12.460 --> 01:47:14.098
Ladies, if you'll sign right here.

01:47:24.980 --> 01:47:26.379
- Here?
- Yes, please.

01:47:26.500 --> 01:47:28.536
It's on the right-hand side there.

01:47:28.620 --> 01:47:30.850
I'm really looking forward to going.

01:47:30.940 --> 01:47:33.249
The neighborhood here has changed so.

01:47:33.380 --> 01:47:36.531
Yes. Especially since they won
that old pennant thing.

01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:42.060
Oh, dear, I'm so sorry.
We've overlooked something.

01:47:42.140 --> 01:47:45.576
It's absolutely compulsory that we have
the signature of a physician.

01:47:45.660 --> 01:47:46.775
A doctor.

01:47:46.900 --> 01:47:49.460
Dr. Einstein! Come here
and sign some papers, please.

01:47:49.540 --> 01:47:51.531
- Good night.
- Come here, Dr. Einstein.

01:47:51.620 --> 01:47:52.814
- A doctor?
- Yes.

01:47:52.940 --> 01:47:56.489
Dr. Einstein almost operated on me earlier.
Come along, Doctor.

01:47:58.580 --> 01:48:01.219
Now, here. Just sign right here,
please, Doctor.

01:48:01.300 --> 01:48:03.814
- Were you leaving, Doctor?
- Yes, please.

01:48:03.900 --> 01:48:06.698
Aren't you going to wait for Jonathan?

01:48:06.820 --> 01:48:09.618
I don't think we go to the same place.

01:48:10.020 --> 01:48:13.296
Hello, Mac. We picked up that guy
that's wanted in Indiana.

01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:16.372
His accomplice's description is
on the circular, on the desk.

01:48:16.460 --> 01:48:17.495
Read it to me, will you?

01:48:19.980 --> 01:48:21.174
About 40.

01:48:21.660 --> 01:48:23.139
Five-foot-three.

01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:24.973
One hundred and forty pounds.

01:48:25.620 --> 01:48:26.894
Pop eyes.

01:48:28.380 --> 01:48:30.371
Talks with a German accent.

01:48:30.700 --> 01:48:32.133
Poses as a doctor.

01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.819
Okay, Mac. Thanks.

01:48:33.940 --> 01:48:37.091
It's all right. The doctor
has completed the signatures.

01:48:37.220 --> 01:48:38.414
That's great!

01:48:38.580 --> 01:48:41.970
Thanks, Doc.
You've done Brooklyn a great service.

01:48:46.940 --> 01:48:48.737
But Dr. Einstein!

01:48:52.060 --> 01:48:55.370
- Now, Mr. Witherspoon...
- You're Witherspoon, I'm Brewster.

01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:58.094
It's contagious, yes. It's your turn.

01:48:58.460 --> 01:49:00.496
- Don't play games...
- You sign.

01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:02.656
You sign as next of kin.

01:49:03.020 --> 01:49:06.410
Why didn't you say so?
I'm all confused. Don't mind me.

01:49:08.260 --> 01:49:09.534
Mr. Witherport.

01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.811
- Spoon.
- Here.

01:49:12.420 --> 01:49:13.739
Come up and pack my duffel.

01:49:16.020 --> 01:49:17.169
Duffel?

01:49:17.260 --> 01:49:19.820
Pack his duffel. He's President, you know?

01:49:20.180 --> 01:49:22.091
And bring along my bugle.

01:49:23.860 --> 01:49:24.975
President.

01:49:33.900 --> 01:49:35.219
Don't charge!

01:49:47.900 --> 01:49:50.858
We're really very worried about something.

01:49:51.620 --> 01:49:54.214
Now, darling, don't be worried.

01:49:54.700 --> 01:49:57.772
- Me too, Mortimer.
- Well, of course, darling.

01:49:58.620 --> 01:50:00.611
You'll both be very happy at Happy Dale.

01:50:00.700 --> 01:50:04.898
We're very happy about the whole thing,
but that's just it.

01:50:05.220 --> 01:50:07.370
We don't want anything to go wrong.

01:50:09.220 --> 01:50:11.893
Will they investigate those signatures?

01:50:12.900 --> 01:50:16.688
- They won't look up Dr. Einstein...
- But it's not his signature, dear.

01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.651
- It's yours.
- Mine?

01:50:18.740 --> 01:50:21.857
You see, you signed as next of kin.

01:50:22.140 --> 01:50:26.179
- What's wrong about that, darling?
- Martha, you tell him.

01:50:28.220 --> 01:50:29.494
Well, dear.

01:50:29.580 --> 01:50:33.334
- What, dear?
- You're not really a Brewster.

01:50:34.660 --> 01:50:37.094
- What?
- Your mother came to us as a cook.

01:50:37.220 --> 01:50:39.450
And you were born
about three months afterwards.

01:50:39.540 --> 01:50:42.373
And she was such a sweet woman
and such a good cook...

01:50:42.460 --> 01:50:45.896
...we didn't want to lose her.
So brother married her.

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.131
Your real father was a cook, too.

01:50:48.260 --> 01:50:51.297
He was a chef on a tramp steamer.

01:50:54.540 --> 01:50:57.691
You mean I'm not really a Brewster?

01:50:59.620 --> 01:51:02.134
- Darling!
- Don't feel so badly about it.

01:51:02.260 --> 01:51:05.252
I'm sure it won't make any difference
to Elaine.

01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:16.898
Where are you? Can you hear me?
I'm not really a Brewster!

01:51:16.980 --> 01:51:18.777
I'm the son of a sea cook!

01:51:24.980 --> 01:51:27.096
It's true! I saw them. It's true.

01:51:27.220 --> 01:51:29.734
It's true! There are 13 bodies down there!

01:51:29.900 --> 01:51:31.572
But I saw them...

01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:34.613
What's all this screaming about?

01:51:34.700 --> 01:51:37.737
- But I saw them...
- It's way past her bedtime.

01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:40.335
Quiet!

01:51:43.780 --> 01:51:45.896
- But, Mortimer...
- Goodbye!

01:51:45.980 --> 01:51:48.210
- 'Bye.
- Goodbye, darling!

01:51:50.260 --> 01:51:53.377
- What is all this?
- They're going on their honeymoon.

01:51:53.780 --> 01:51:55.736
They're off to a flying start.

01:52:02.020 --> 01:52:03.419
I really did see...

01:52:04.020 --> 01:52:06.056
You'll own two cabs!

01:52:06.740 --> 01:52:08.856
I mean the meter!

01:52:09.180 --> 01:52:10.693
Oh, Mortimer.

01:52:21.220 --> 01:52:23.609
We're going to Niagara Falls.
Call me a cab, dear.

01:52:23.700 --> 01:52:25.053
Yes, love.

01:52:34.860 --> 01:52:37.852
