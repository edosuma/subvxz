hard for you.

I just couldn't convince
him to give you a shot.

09:04.919 --> 09:08.172

you could change his mind.

09:08.256 --> 09:09.548

you trying, Bella.

Uh, listen, I know you
really wanted to

play in this week's game,
but after a lot of thought,

09:28.859 --> 09:31.028

just isn't right.

Coach Sanders.

to him, too.

a stick basket for his birthday.

a piece of my mind.

riding on this game.

best for the team.
