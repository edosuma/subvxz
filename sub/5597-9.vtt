00:06.111 --> 00:08.539
Hello, handsome.

00:09.943 --> 00:11.675
Wow. That excited to see me?

00:11.677 --> 00:12.943
I'm very excited.

00:12.946 --> 00:15.880
Just, I was up
half the night, so...

00:15.882 --> 00:17.215
Mwah.

00:17.217 --> 00:18.549
So, you going home
to get some sleep?

00:18.551 --> 00:21.252
Yeah, I'm gonna go see
Kristine first, though.

00:21.254 --> 00:22.825
Ah, the girlfriend.

00:24.121 --> 00:26.056
What? She's a girl,
and she's your friend.

00:26.058 --> 00:28.659
That's all I'm saying.

00:28.661 --> 00:29.893
I though
you were okay with this.

00:29.895 --> 00:31.695
Yeah, of course I am.

00:31.697 --> 00:34.798
I'm glad that you can talk
to her about your...

00:35.514 --> 00:36.433
Problem?

00:37.737 --> 00:38.902
Specialness?

00:38.904 --> 00:40.003
Not a word.

00:40.005 --> 00:41.938
It is now.

00:41.940 --> 00:43.741
Look, I get
that you have questions,

00:43.743 --> 00:46.910
and maybe she can help answer
some of them for you.

00:46.912 --> 00:48.778
I am fine, seriously.

00:48.780 --> 00:50.442
Mm, you're not fine.

00:51.281 --> 00:53.883
You're fantastic.

00:53.885 --> 00:55.718
Mm.

00:55.720 --> 00:57.653
I love you more than anything.

00:57.655 --> 01:00.122
I love you.

01:00.124 --> 01:02.992
And I need you to keep an eye
on Mr. Graham's B.P.

01:02.994 --> 01:05.795
He's had some idiopathic spikes
since his thoracic surgery.

01:07.265 --> 01:08.663
- Got it.
- Okay.

01:08.665 --> 01:10.932
So, you walking
or running the 10k, Dr. Lin?

01:10.934 --> 01:12.333
Do I look like
I use seniors' tickets?

01:12.335 --> 01:14.403
What? No, no, I just...

01:14.405 --> 01:16.304
I'll be back in an hour. If there's
anything, just ask Dr. Reid.

01:16.306 --> 01:17.272
Okay?

01:18.374 --> 01:19.608
Yeah.

01:19.610 --> 01:22.511
We'll have two
of your finest coffees, milady,

01:22.513 --> 01:24.813
and mine with four shots
of espresso, please.

01:24.815 --> 01:27.382
Uh, wow. Don't you think
that's a bit much?

01:27.384 --> 01:29.284
Thought I was the one
running the race.

01:29.286 --> 01:30.685
Trust me.

01:30.687 --> 01:32.787
P.R. work is its own kind of marathon.

01:33.856 --> 01:35.188
Thank you.

01:35.190 --> 01:36.757
Thank you.

01:39.861 --> 01:42.396
Dr. Williams, avoiding eye contact

01:42.398 --> 01:43.531
doesn't mean
that I don't see you.

01:43.533 --> 01:47.000
What? Oh, no. I wasn't, uh...

01:47.002 --> 01:48.569
Good morning, Dr. Bell.

01:48.571 --> 01:50.003
Did you enjoy your vacation?

01:50.005 --> 01:51.504
No.

01:51.506 --> 01:53.606
O-kay. Sorry to hear that.

01:53.608 --> 01:55.775
I had some personal things
that I needed to deal with.

01:55.777 --> 01:58.145
Tell me, Cassie, how long
has that been going on?

01:58.147 --> 02:00.880
Oh, I don't, um...

02:00.882 --> 02:03.016
A little while now.

02:03.018 --> 02:04.812
Sorry. I know
you guys just broke up.

02:04.957 --> 02:06.764
Don't be. I'm not.

02:11.566 --> 02:12.725
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:12.727 --> 02:15.495
Did Charlie ever tell you
about the time we went to Vegas?

02:16.932 --> 02:18.397
I thought
that what happened there

02:18.399 --> 02:20.600
- was supposed to stay there.
- Well, it does...

02:20.602 --> 02:23.002
Unless she follows you home
and tries to move in.

02:23.004 --> 02:24.604
I really don't want to know.

02:24.606 --> 02:25.638
Don't worry.

02:25.640 --> 02:26.806
Charlie was
an absolute gentleman.

02:26.808 --> 02:28.908
- Almost a monk, really.
- Be nice.

02:28.910 --> 02:30.477
- What's on the docket?
- Gallbladder.

02:30.479 --> 02:32.177
What do you say we call
a plumber to take over,

02:32.179 --> 02:33.579
and you and I go hit the track?

02:33.581 --> 02:35.914
Come on, Reid. Be a pal.

02:38.317 --> 02:40.752
Pals, huh? Tell me something.

02:40.754 --> 02:42.588
Do you think men and women
could ever just be friends,

02:42.590 --> 02:44.790
or does romance
always get in the way?

02:44.792 --> 02:46.692
Is this about Charlie?

02:46.694 --> 02:48.527
Just making conversation.

02:48.529 --> 02:50.395
Good. 'Cause the answer's no.

02:50.397 --> 02:52.464
Men only befriend women
they want to sleep with.

02:52.466 --> 02:54.299
Always.

02:54.301 --> 02:57.267
With a minor adjustment
for the castrati.

02:59.205 --> 03:02.640
I am never making conversation
with you again.

03:04.000 --> 03:10.074

03:14.520 --> 03:17.053
What's this? You supposed
to be some sort of stick insect?

03:17.055 --> 03:20.156
I'm not really concerned
about my appearance.

03:20.158 --> 03:21.324
I'm more concerned
about obtaining

03:21.326 --> 03:24.360
an optimal cardiovascular
workout, you know?

03:24.362 --> 03:26.730
Which reminds me... you have
yet to sponsor me, Zachary.

03:26.732 --> 03:28.097
Right.

03:28.099 --> 03:31.362
Well, that's because I've
donated to some other people.

03:33.112 --> 03:34.089
Whom?

03:34.220 --> 03:35.685
Just some nurses.

03:36.841 --> 03:40.777
So, get out there
and... break a tentacle.

03:40.779 --> 03:42.611
You get them, Hamza.

03:42.613 --> 03:44.580
Yeah.

03:45.583 --> 03:47.416
Okay.

03:47.418 --> 03:49.818
So, I guess I've got...

03:49.820 --> 03:53.155
80 bucks on Maggie
for the best time.

03:53.157 --> 03:55.257
Thanks for the donation.

04:01.031 --> 04:02.598
- Dr. Reid?
- Mm-hmm.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.866
- Do you have a sec?
- Sure.

04:04.868 --> 04:07.569
I need some advice
on B.P. spikes I'm seeing

04:07.571 --> 04:09.604
in one of Dr. Lin's thoracics
in ward 7.

04:09.606 --> 04:11.506
What medicine
is your patient on?

04:11.508 --> 04:12.874
Uh, yeah, yeah.

04:12.876 --> 04:15.377
I got that right here, actually.

04:15.379 --> 04:18.146
Um...

04:18.148 --> 04:20.714
You know what?

04:20.716 --> 04:22.517
Dr. Lin won't mind
if we give her a call.

04:22.519 --> 04:24.319
It'll give us a chance
to check up on the race.

04:24.321 --> 04:25.352
Sound like a good idea?

04:25.354 --> 04:28.055
- Yeah.
- All right.

04:31.494 --> 04:33.860
Whew!

04:37.765 --> 04:39.666
Yeah? What's up?

04:39.668 --> 04:41.335
Hey, it's Alex. How's it going?

04:42.571 --> 04:46.139
Well... a pregnant woman
is passing me,

04:46.141 --> 04:47.807
so not that stellar.

04:47.809 --> 04:49.875
What's up?

04:49.877 --> 04:52.745
Your thoracic in ward 7...
What did you prescribe?

04:52.747 --> 04:54.680
- Anti-inflammatories...
- Right.

04:54.682 --> 04:55.715
Gabapentin...

04:57.152 --> 04:58.585
What the hell was that?

04:58.587 --> 05:01.488
I don't know.

05:01.490 --> 05:03.423
Maggie?

05:03.425 --> 05:05.525
Maggie, what just happened?

05:05.527 --> 05:07.427
Come on, Maggie. Talk to me.

05:07.429 --> 05:09.128
Are you okay?

05:11.664 --> 05:13.965
Maggie, what's going on?

05:13.967 --> 05:15.767
Are you okay?

05:15.769 --> 05:17.569
Maggie?

06:38.792 --> 06:41.114
S04E09
Shattered

06:41.312 --> 06:43.832
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

06:48.413 --> 06:50.266
Jackson, the trauma team
just got here from St. Mary's.

06:50.305 --> 06:51.414
Hustle them in.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.916
This is organized chaos, people.

06:52.918 --> 06:54.918
Everyone who walks through
that door gets triage-tagged.

06:54.920 --> 06:56.786
Assess the damage and put
a tag near their head. Got it?

06:56.788 --> 06:59.355
Good.
Dev, take treatment cubicle one.

06:59.357 --> 07:01.557
Cassie, you come with me.

07:01.559 --> 07:03.703
Good. Okay.

07:04.696 --> 07:06.355
Okay, hold up on cpr.

07:09.366 --> 07:11.600
He's gone.

07:13.373 --> 07:14.482
Call it.

07:16.589 --> 07:19.675
Time of death... 9:47 A.M.

07:25.014 --> 07:26.215
Zach.

07:26.217 --> 07:27.583
Was it really a bombing?

07:27.585 --> 07:28.951
- A terrorist attack?
- No one knows.

07:28.953 --> 07:31.186
It could have been a gas leak,
but it's bad.

07:31.188 --> 07:32.287
We're gonna be overwhelmed.

07:32.289 --> 07:34.323
Okay, citywide, emerg is on it.

07:34.325 --> 07:35.357
They're setting up here.

07:35.359 --> 07:36.958
What's the blood-bank supply?

07:36.960 --> 07:39.627
Scarce. We're gonna have
to share the wealth.

07:43.932 --> 07:45.266
- Hey.
- Hey.

07:45.268 --> 07:47.369
- Did you see Maggie? Is she okay?
- No.

07:47.371 --> 07:49.203
Oh, I-i don't know, Alex.
She wasn't with us.

07:49.205 --> 07:50.505
Hey, Reid.

07:50.507 --> 07:51.606
Need you here.

07:53.676 --> 07:54.808
- What have we got?
- John Doe.

07:54.810 --> 07:56.577
- Fast is positive.
- Oh, no kidding.

07:56.579 --> 07:57.845
I doubt there's
a single internal organ

07:57.847 --> 07:58.946
that hasn't been punctured.

07:58.948 --> 08:00.369
Guys, we're having trouble
ventilating him.

08:00.416 --> 08:02.049
Well, keep pushing 100% oxygen.

08:02.051 --> 08:04.051
Blast lung?

08:04.053 --> 08:06.053
Yeah, looks like it.

08:06.055 --> 08:07.755
Somebody get me
the portable X-ray!

08:07.757 --> 08:09.090
We'll shoot the plates here.

08:09.092 --> 08:12.293
And give me more o neg!
He's bleeding like a sieve.

08:12.295 --> 08:13.726
Jackson.

08:13.728 --> 08:15.361
Call Charlie
to come back in here.

08:15.363 --> 08:17.097
- We're gonna need everyone.
- Okay.

08:17.099 --> 08:19.766
This guy's a mess.

08:56.602 --> 08:57.836
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hey.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.604
Thanks for coming. I know
it was kind of short notice.

08:59.606 --> 09:03.508
Yeah, well, you're a pretty hard
woman to say "no" to.

09:03.510 --> 09:05.877
What's, uh...
What's the big mystery?

09:07.360 --> 09:08.647
Come in.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.302
Okay.

09:19.759 --> 09:21.693
Wow. These are, uh...

09:22.902 --> 09:24.795
Pretty amazing.

09:24.797 --> 09:26.530
Thanks.

09:26.532 --> 09:29.621
Yeah, I used to paint
a lot more.

09:30.436 --> 09:32.103
Do you want some tea?

09:32.105 --> 09:33.637
Yeah, sure.

09:41.914 --> 09:44.548
You must be Dr. Harris.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.517
I've heard an earful about you.

09:46.519 --> 09:47.551
You did?!

09:47.553 --> 09:49.219
Uh, and you would be?

09:49.221 --> 09:51.688
Dr. Boullot.
But please call me Cora.

09:51.690 --> 09:53.123
Cora. I'm Charlie.

09:53.125 --> 09:54.424
Cora's just here for the day.

09:54.426 --> 09:55.625
She stopped off from New York

09:55.627 --> 09:57.427
on her way to a medical
conference in Vancouver.

09:57.429 --> 09:58.428
Oh.

09:58.430 --> 09:59.997
And you two
know each other from?

09:59.999 --> 10:03.633
Well, we met online,
but we've talked a lot.

10:03.635 --> 10:05.435
- Haven't we?
- Mm-hmm. We have.

10:05.437 --> 10:06.703
Modern life, right?

10:06.705 --> 10:08.538
Right.

10:08.540 --> 10:10.374
Right. And, um...

10:10.376 --> 10:12.376
Speaking of which,
I left my phone in my car.

10:12.378 --> 10:14.377
Do you need your phone
to have tea?

10:14.379 --> 10:16.713
Uh, no, no.
I have an infant son, so...

10:16.715 --> 10:19.248
You don't look like
the overprotective type.

10:21.685 --> 10:24.454
Are we, uh, gonna
get along here, Cora?

10:24.456 --> 10:26.289
Absolutely, Charlie.
I'm determined to.

10:26.291 --> 10:27.424
Really? Why would that be?

10:27.426 --> 10:29.692
Because I'm a doctor
who speaks to the dead.

10:29.694 --> 10:34.163
And I understand from Kristine
that you do, too.

10:38.368 --> 10:40.269
Shel, it's all right.

10:40.271 --> 10:41.304
Maggie.

10:41.306 --> 10:42.939
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

10:42.941 --> 10:44.873
Everyone says they're fine. You've
got a scratch on your head.

10:44.968 --> 10:45.654
You're probably in shock.

10:45.720 --> 10:46.909
Really, Zach, I'm fine.
Okay, this is Shelby.

10:46.911 --> 10:48.210
- Where's my husband?
- She's pregnant.

10:48.212 --> 10:49.979
She has a bad laceration on her leg

10:49.981 --> 10:51.547
- and probably some kind of shrapnel.
- Okay, great.

10:51.549 --> 10:52.681
Let's get her into a hall bed,

10:52.683 --> 10:53.882
'cause there's no room in here right now.

10:53.884 --> 10:55.151
- I need you to stay here with me.
- Oh.

10:55.153 --> 10:56.718
I need to take a look
at that gash on your head.

10:56.720 --> 10:58.454
Come here.

10:58.456 --> 11:00.889
Do you know
what happened out there?

11:00.891 --> 11:03.659
Yeah.

11:03.661 --> 11:05.226
This.

11:05.228 --> 11:06.294
Jesus.

11:07.645 --> 11:08.872
Cassie.

11:09.083 --> 11:11.132
Come here.

11:11.134 --> 11:12.601
I need you to take care of this.

11:12.603 --> 11:15.170
I need you find out if it belongs
to anybody who's been admitted.

11:15.172 --> 11:17.739
I'm looking after Dr. Lin.
You're coming with me.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.340
You had no right
telling her about me.

11:28.989 --> 11:30.885
Look at it as a chance

11:30.887 --> 11:32.887
to talk to another doctor
who sees what you do.

11:32.889 --> 11:34.254
You don't know that.

11:34.256 --> 11:35.990
And I don't know that.

11:35.992 --> 11:37.358
And I don't know her.

11:37.360 --> 11:39.426
You didn't tell me
he was a skeptic.

11:39.428 --> 11:41.328
Oh, he's not. He's just...

11:41.330 --> 11:42.530
Narrow-minded, pigheaded.

11:42.532 --> 11:44.565
Wary.

11:44.567 --> 11:46.264
Fearful.

11:47.557 --> 11:51.237
You and I saw things together
in the spirit realm, Charlie.

11:51.356 --> 11:52.672
You can't deny that.

11:52.674 --> 11:53.974
I'm not denying it.

11:53.976 --> 11:55.809
I'm just trying
to keep an open mind

11:55.811 --> 11:57.511
about what it means, that's all.

11:57.513 --> 11:59.514
By closing your mind?

12:00.016 --> 12:01.081
Uh...

12:01.083 --> 12:03.450
I'm... I'm sorry.
Is this an intervention?

12:03.452 --> 12:05.019
Should I be standing up
and saying,

12:05.021 --> 12:06.420
"hello.
My name is Charlie Harris,

12:06.422 --> 12:08.455
and I see ghosts?"

12:08.457 --> 12:11.456
Well, it would be
a good first step.

12:12.395 --> 12:14.828
I'm fine.
It's just a couple of bruises.

12:14.830 --> 12:17.031
Mm-hmm. Just consider me
your second opinion.

12:17.033 --> 12:19.483
Just gonna do a concussion test.

12:22.266 --> 12:23.169
That hurt your eyes?

12:23.171 --> 12:24.170
No.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.072
You feeling nauseous?

12:26.074 --> 12:28.322
Yeah, but that's
just your cologne.

12:28.546 --> 12:30.544
Count down from 100. 99, 98...

12:30.546 --> 12:31.912
I really need to go see Shelby.

12:31.914 --> 12:33.747
Not until
I send you up to imaging.

12:33.749 --> 12:35.348
Fine. I'll do the scan.

12:35.350 --> 12:38.785
But can I just stay on the floor
until that happens?

12:38.787 --> 12:40.554
You check in with me every hour.

12:40.556 --> 12:42.889
- You swear?
- Pinkie swear.

12:44.106 --> 12:45.658
Maggie?

12:45.660 --> 12:47.560
Maggie. Thank God.

12:47.562 --> 12:49.429
I knew I gave up running
for a reason.

12:49.431 --> 12:51.364
No kidding. I need to
go be with my patient.

12:51.366 --> 12:53.332
- Of course.
- Right after I clean up.

12:53.334 --> 12:55.168
Zach, I need more O neg.

12:55.170 --> 12:56.502
I've got a kid
that's gonna bleed out.

12:56.504 --> 12:58.271
Sorry, we're swamped.
We don't have any.

12:58.273 --> 13:01.441
All right, I'll push starch,
albumin, and ringer's,

13:01.443 --> 13:03.508
but the second that
that comes in, you let me know.

13:03.510 --> 13:05.009
Yeah.

13:06.480 --> 13:09.181
It's gonna be a hell
of a blood drive.

13:09.183 --> 13:10.282
Call down to the cafeteria,

13:10.284 --> 13:11.550
the laundry room,
and the gift shop,

13:11.552 --> 13:13.485
and get every staff member
who's not in this E.R.

13:13.487 --> 13:14.519
To step up and donate.

13:14.521 --> 13:15.753
- Yeah, I got you.
- Yes.

13:18.525 --> 13:19.757
Hi. Dawn Bell, chief of surgery.

13:19.759 --> 13:20.758
Hi. Detective Lozio.

13:20.760 --> 13:22.093
Detective, is this necessary?

13:22.095 --> 13:23.227
Absolutely.

13:23.229 --> 13:24.861
Our assumption is,
this was an act of terror.

13:24.863 --> 13:26.163
We need to question
the victims, Dr. Bell.

13:26.165 --> 13:27.465
We'd appreciate
your cooperation.

13:27.467 --> 13:29.866
All right. As long as it doesn't
interfere with their care.

13:29.868 --> 13:31.432
You just let us know if we're
stepping on any toes, doc.

13:31.538 --> 13:32.382
I will.

13:32.505 --> 13:34.071
And I'm sorry for your loss.

13:34.073 --> 13:36.607
I know that our first casualty
was a police officer.

13:36.609 --> 13:39.510
Yeah, a rookie... 23 years old.

13:39.512 --> 13:41.646
We're gonna get
whoever did this.

13:42.306 --> 13:43.942
Excuse me.

13:55.360 --> 13:56.459
Okay, Shelby.

13:56.461 --> 13:58.561
We're still looking
for your husband.

13:58.563 --> 13:59.596
But the good news is,

13:59.598 --> 14:01.498
your fast was negative.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.798
I'm sorry?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.301
It means that I couldn't find
any free fluid

14:05.303 --> 14:06.669
in your abdomen.

14:06.671 --> 14:09.338
Um, I still want to check
on the baby with a fetal monitor

14:09.340 --> 14:12.474
and remove the shrapnel
from your leg, obviously.

14:12.476 --> 14:14.176
What if it hurt the baby?

14:14.178 --> 14:15.410
That's what we're gonna check.

14:15.412 --> 14:16.678
I'm gonna do an ultrasound.

14:16.680 --> 14:18.280
Why did I do this?

14:18.282 --> 14:20.182
Adam didn't want me
to run the 10k.

14:20.184 --> 14:22.317
He thought it was doing
too much with the baby.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.585
Your husband
was in the race, too?

14:23.587 --> 14:24.886
No.

14:24.888 --> 14:26.155
Is he here?

14:26.157 --> 14:27.758
We're working on it.

14:28.998 --> 14:30.359
Okay.

14:30.361 --> 14:31.726
Shelby...

14:31.728 --> 14:33.327
Nobody knew
this was gonna happen.

14:33.329 --> 14:35.496
We're gonna do
everything in our power

14:35.498 --> 14:37.957
to make sure
the baby is healthy.

14:39.268 --> 14:40.793
Pinkie swear.

14:41.370 --> 14:42.904
It's my new thing.

14:48.443 --> 14:50.178
- Hey.
- Lungs look wet,

14:50.180 --> 14:52.147
and there's
a telltale butterfly effect.

14:52.149 --> 14:53.314
Blast lung it is.

14:53.316 --> 14:54.716
Gonna make the anesthetist's job
real tricky.

14:54.718 --> 14:56.517
He's not gonna make it
to the O.R.

14:56.519 --> 14:57.785
What are you talking about?

14:57.787 --> 14:59.687
The blood bank's overwhelmed.
There's no O neg.

14:59.689 --> 15:01.289
I mean, we could push
hydroxyethyl starch,

15:01.291 --> 15:02.490
but you and I
both know more blood

15:02.492 --> 15:03.891
is the only way
that he's gonna survive.

15:03.893 --> 15:05.059
Oh, hell.

15:05.061 --> 15:06.927
- Yeah, hell.
- I'm O neg.

15:08.564 --> 15:10.598
All right, we'll do
a whole blood transfusion.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.633
- Hook me up to him.
- Seriously?

15:12.635 --> 15:14.068
Yep. They do it on
the battlefield all the time.

15:14.070 --> 15:15.469
That's pretty much
what we're looking at here.

15:15.471 --> 15:17.537
Odds are he'll react negatively
to the transfusion.

15:17.539 --> 15:19.606
Odds are he's gonna die, so...

15:19.608 --> 15:21.274
We might as well buy the kid
some more time.

15:21.276 --> 15:23.476
Okay.

15:23.478 --> 15:25.512
Let's turn you into a blood bag.

15:25.514 --> 15:27.214
Two units... coming up.

15:27.216 --> 15:28.981
Charlie said you were crazy.

15:28.983 --> 15:30.684
Hey, pot and kettle, Reid.

15:39.557 --> 15:41.623
Fetal heart rate is normal.

15:41.625 --> 15:42.824
No signs of trauma.

15:42.826 --> 15:44.393
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

15:45.662 --> 15:46.895
Shelby!

15:46.897 --> 15:48.297
Shelby, oh, my God. Baby.

15:48.299 --> 15:50.099
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

15:50.101 --> 15:51.967
I thought I'd lost you.

15:51.969 --> 15:53.936
- I thought I'd lost you.
- Okay, you have to be gentle.

15:53.938 --> 15:55.404
I know you're worried,
but she's been hurt.

15:55.406 --> 15:57.106
Who are you?

15:57.108 --> 15:59.340
I'm taking care of Shelby.
I'm Dr. Lin.

15:59.342 --> 16:01.376
Okay, what's wrong with her?

16:01.378 --> 16:02.878
Is the baby okay?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.112
Nobody's told me anything.

16:04.114 --> 16:05.213
Okay, if you sit down,

16:05.215 --> 16:07.465
I'd be happy to explain
everything to you.

16:09.536 --> 16:12.420
The baby is stable.
So is Shelby.

16:12.422 --> 16:14.522
I'm just about to remove
the shrapnel from her leg.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.558
No, you got to do that
in an operating room.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.627
No, we're gonna do it
under a local here.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.963
We have a lot of patients
that need our help,

16:20.965 --> 16:23.798
and the critically injured
are given O.R. priority.

16:23.800 --> 16:25.866
Yeah, well,
Shelby's my priority.

16:25.868 --> 16:28.403
You should know that I've
called our obstetrician.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.143
Dr. Katz will be here soon.

16:30.706 --> 16:32.307
Sydney Katz?

16:32.610 --> 16:33.797
Yeah.

16:37.279 --> 16:39.880
Dr. Barlow, please
report to pediatric room 8.

16:40.842 --> 16:42.584
For Dr. Miller.

16:42.586 --> 16:44.119
What is it?

16:44.121 --> 16:45.987
It's a young woman's arm.

16:45.989 --> 16:47.588
Oh, my God.

16:47.590 --> 16:49.056
Tell him that I assessed
the zone of injury,

16:49.058 --> 16:50.390
and it's still viable
for reattachment

16:50.392 --> 16:53.002
- after a little clean-up.
- What's the patient's name?

16:53.622 --> 16:54.862
We don't know yet.

16:54.864 --> 16:57.698
Just keep it here under
Jane Doe till we do, please.

16:57.700 --> 16:59.500
Um...

16:59.502 --> 17:01.502
And this belongs to her.

17:31.533 --> 17:33.133
I need
the trauma bay, Alex.

17:33.135 --> 17:34.534
What is going on here?

17:34.536 --> 17:35.802
Every little bit counts, right?

17:35.804 --> 17:37.503
The donor looks good.
How's the patient?

17:37.505 --> 17:39.372
- It's working. He's stable.
- That's good.

17:39.374 --> 17:41.541
So you two crazy kids
can get him up to the O.R.

17:41.543 --> 17:43.043
- And out of my trauma bay.
- No.

17:43.045 --> 17:44.778
What do you mean, "no"?

17:44.780 --> 17:46.046
The O.R. is jammed, Zach.

17:46.048 --> 17:47.613
I'm not gonna stand
in the hallway

17:47.615 --> 17:49.683
waiting for the operating room
and watch him bleed out.

17:49.685 --> 17:50.717
He's stable here.

17:50.719 --> 17:51.918
Dawn!

17:51.920 --> 17:54.653
- Yep.
- Need you.

17:55.889 --> 17:57.156
What the hell is this?

17:57.158 --> 17:59.624
Reid and Bishop need
to get him up into surgery.

17:59.626 --> 18:01.426
He's gonna die while we're
waiting for an operating room.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.796
- He needs to be first priority.
- Why?

18:03.798 --> 18:05.964
Because he has
penetrating abdominal trauma.

18:05.966 --> 18:07.332
Well, so do
half the patients here.

18:07.334 --> 18:08.867
Not combined with blast lung.

18:08.869 --> 18:10.803
He has a very narrow window
to be operated on.

18:10.805 --> 18:12.071
His lungs will collapse
if we wait.

18:12.073 --> 18:15.299
Come on, Dawn. Look, he's a kid.

18:16.130 --> 18:16.741
Fine.

18:16.743 --> 18:18.810
I need a trauma bay
more than I need an argument.

18:18.812 --> 18:21.104
Get him up to the O.R. now.

18:22.252 --> 18:23.481
What a day.

18:23.483 --> 18:24.749
What a lovely day.

18:26.653 --> 18:28.553
Well, my experience
isn't the same as yours.

18:28.555 --> 18:32.190
I mean, yes, I see ghosts,
but, uh...

18:32.192 --> 18:35.460
I also see patients

18:35.462 --> 18:38.663
in some kind of liminal state...

18:38.665 --> 18:40.232
between life and death.

18:40.234 --> 18:42.434
And do they stay there?

18:43.199 --> 18:45.069
No, that's, um...

18:47.606 --> 18:49.540
Basically, I help them.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.243
Um, it's kind of weird,

18:52.245 --> 18:54.746
but it's become
another part of my job,

18:54.748 --> 18:58.682
like charting or scrubbing or...

18:58.684 --> 19:01.313
Tell her how things
have been changing, Charlie.

19:01.881 --> 19:03.520
You were there. You tell her.

19:04.651 --> 19:06.190
Well...

19:06.192 --> 19:09.526
Charlie and I
saw this woman's spirit

19:09.528 --> 19:12.264
draw her soul mate into death
after her.

19:12.686 --> 19:14.698
I've never seen that before.

19:14.700 --> 19:16.063
Have you?

19:17.969 --> 19:20.971
Have there been other encounters
that have frightened you?

19:25.009 --> 19:26.527
Why would she ask me that?

19:26.619 --> 19:28.083
Please.

19:28.281 --> 19:29.313
Indulge me.

19:33.085 --> 19:37.388
There was a convict
who wanted me to help him

19:37.390 --> 19:38.751
to, uh...

19:40.092 --> 19:41.158
prove his innocence.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.726
What happened?

19:42.728 --> 19:44.961
I wavered.

19:44.963 --> 19:47.197
And?

19:47.199 --> 19:50.401
And he followed me home...

19:50.403 --> 19:53.202
to my son's room...

19:53.204 --> 19:57.173
and, uh, begged me for help.

19:57.175 --> 19:59.141
And later on,
when I wouldn't help him,

19:59.143 --> 20:00.443
he threatened me.

20:00.445 --> 20:02.679
And had any of them
ever followed you home before?

20:02.681 --> 20:04.647
- No.
- So you have reason to be afraid.

20:04.649 --> 20:06.248
- I'm not afraid.
- You should be.

20:06.250 --> 20:09.686
I had an encounter
like the one you describe.

20:09.688 --> 20:13.122
It was about 5 years ago.

20:13.124 --> 20:15.024
This is the result.

20:15.026 --> 20:16.892
Oh, my God.

20:16.894 --> 20:17.960
Cora.

20:20.931 --> 20:22.965
Hey. Charlie, it's me again.

20:22.967 --> 20:24.433
I don't know where you are

20:24.435 --> 20:26.735
or why you're not answering
my calls, but we need you here.

20:26.737 --> 20:29.604
So if you get this,
please, call me back.

20:29.606 --> 20:31.874
- Hey.
- Oh, I see you got your juice and cookies.

20:31.876 --> 20:34.877
Yeah. What I could really go for
is a single malt and cigar.

20:34.879 --> 20:36.778
Tell me about it.

20:36.780 --> 20:38.380
You still trying
to get ahold of Charlie?

20:39.615 --> 20:40.916
Hey, maybe he slept
through the call.

20:40.918 --> 20:42.051
He never sleeps through calls.

20:42.053 --> 20:43.384
Okay, well maybe
his ringer's off.

20:43.386 --> 20:44.385
Mnh-mnh.

20:44.387 --> 20:45.553
No way.

20:45.555 --> 20:46.554
Not since Luke was born.

20:46.556 --> 20:48.556
This doesn't have anything to do

20:48.558 --> 20:50.225
with what we talked
about earlier, does it?

20:50.227 --> 20:52.727
I really don't want
to talk about this right now.

20:52.729 --> 20:54.295
Okay, well, for what it's worth,

20:54.297 --> 20:56.364
I think Charlie's the one
exception to that rule.

20:57.063 --> 20:58.699
Thank you.

20:59.029 --> 21:00.768
See you in there.

21:05.506 --> 21:07.307
Well, you're pretty tough, Shelby.

21:07.309 --> 21:09.109
Not even a wince.

21:09.111 --> 21:10.477
Oh, I'm wincing.

21:10.479 --> 21:11.478
You're doing great, baby.

21:12.982 --> 21:14.147
Okay, keep your leg still.

21:16.517 --> 21:18.318
- Is everything okay?
- There's some vaginal bleeding.

21:18.320 --> 21:19.686
What does...
What does that mean?

21:19.688 --> 21:20.888
Heartbeat is still regular.

21:20.890 --> 21:22.055
As soon as imaging's free,

21:22.057 --> 21:24.157
I want to get her up
to another ultrasound, okay?

21:24.159 --> 21:25.425
What's wrong with her?

21:25.427 --> 21:27.560
- It could be nothing.
- What if it's not nothing?

21:27.562 --> 21:29.429
It could be partial abruption
of the placenta...

21:29.431 --> 21:30.597
Maybe from Shelby's fall.

21:30.599 --> 21:32.331
But I do need to prioritize
the leg right now.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.033
We will know more
when we have the imaging.

21:34.035 --> 21:35.034
Where the hell is Dr. Katz?!

21:35.036 --> 21:36.403
I'm sure she'll be here soon.

21:36.405 --> 21:37.737
I need to call her.

21:37.739 --> 21:39.639
She needs to know.

21:45.178 --> 21:47.647
We're gonna do the surgery
with almost no blood

21:47.649 --> 21:49.448
and pretty much blind...
No imaging at all.

21:49.450 --> 21:51.182
Well, it's more exciting
than gallbladders.

21:51.184 --> 21:52.851
- Not helping.
- Okay.

21:52.853 --> 21:55.020
How about
"in the land of the blind,

21:55.022 --> 21:56.855
the one-eyed man is king"?

21:56.857 --> 21:58.156
All right, I'll bite.

21:58.158 --> 21:59.224
What the hell does that mean?

21:59.226 --> 22:00.292
It means we go for it.

22:00.294 --> 22:01.393
Looky, looky.

22:01.395 --> 22:02.694
Hey, where did you get those?

22:02.696 --> 22:03.762
Thank your co-workers

22:03.764 --> 22:06.064
and the lab techies
working their magic.

22:06.066 --> 22:07.065
Hopefully it'll get us through.

22:07.067 --> 22:08.634
Things are looking up.

22:10.202 --> 22:12.270
- Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Hey! What are you doing?

22:12.272 --> 22:13.504
Whoa, you can't be in here.
I won't be long.

22:13.506 --> 22:14.806
Hey! Hey!

22:14.808 --> 22:15.740
I need a photo of his face.

22:15.742 --> 22:16.941
You need to back off, pal.

22:16.943 --> 22:18.075
You are compromising
the sterile environment

22:18.077 --> 22:19.376
of my patient.

22:19.378 --> 22:20.711
- Who the hell are you, anyway?
- I am the police.

22:20.713 --> 22:23.013
And your patient
is the damn bomber.

22:32.143 --> 22:34.377
Hey, what's going on in there?

22:41.619 --> 22:43.520
How's the stomach?

22:43.522 --> 22:44.792
Hmm.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.626
Badly perforated.

22:46.666 --> 22:49.025
Gonna have to work
on closing up these holes.

22:49.027 --> 22:50.160
Yeah.

22:50.162 --> 22:53.663
I'd add that
to his liver and his bowels.

22:53.665 --> 22:54.965
How are his lungs doing, Sharpe?

22:55.641 --> 22:57.067
He's holding up for now.

22:57.069 --> 22:59.469
You know what? I'm gonna have to
sacrifice a huge part of this liver,

22:59.471 --> 23:01.403
but we can leave enough
for it to regenerate.

23:01.405 --> 23:04.706
The cop he killed was
23 years old... 3 months in.

23:04.708 --> 23:06.875
If you think we're happy
giving medical preference to him

23:06.877 --> 23:08.277
over an innocent person,
you're wrong.

23:08.279 --> 23:10.012
Just thought you should know.

23:10.014 --> 23:11.113
I took an oath. We all did.

23:11.115 --> 23:12.747
We're doing our jobs.

23:12.749 --> 23:14.649
And you are welcome to leave if
you've got a problem with that.

23:14.651 --> 23:16.618
I can't, actually.

23:16.620 --> 23:19.491
My orders are to keep him
in my sights at all times.

23:22.258 --> 23:24.459
Nurse Avery, are you all right?

23:24.461 --> 23:27.028
My niece
was hurt in the bombing.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.729
She's at Memorial.

23:28.731 --> 23:30.031
Go assist Dr. Hamza.

23:30.033 --> 23:31.743
Send in another nurse, please.

23:36.171 --> 23:37.938
I pray for your niece.

23:38.814 --> 23:40.741
As do we.

23:42.869 --> 23:44.678
If this kid
is who you say he is,

23:44.680 --> 23:47.280
I'd like to save his life
so he can pay for what he did.

23:53.154 --> 23:54.622
Is Dr. Harris here yet?

23:54.624 --> 23:57.157
I don't think so. Why?

23:57.159 --> 23:59.024
Do you need him for the surgery?

24:03.899 --> 24:07.634
Code blue five, east 64.

24:07.666 --> 24:11.138
Code blue five, east 64.

24:11.140 --> 24:13.040
- Geez, it's wall-to-wall in here.
- Yeah.

24:13.042 --> 24:14.174
How are you doing?

24:14.176 --> 24:15.642
- Okay.
- Okay.

24:15.644 --> 24:16.976
I mean terrible.

24:16.978 --> 24:18.711
Although not as terrible as Dr. Reid.

24:18.713 --> 24:19.812
What does that mean?

24:19.814 --> 24:21.081
You haven't heard?

24:21.083 --> 24:22.682
She's operating on the bomber.

24:22.684 --> 24:23.983
There are cops all over the O.R.

24:23.985 --> 24:25.584
I can't even imagine
how she's feeling right now.

24:25.586 --> 24:27.053
Did you just say he's here?

24:27.055 --> 24:27.920
In the hospital?

24:27.922 --> 24:29.955
My child might die,

24:29.957 --> 24:31.890
and you guys are saving
the bastard who did this?

24:31.892 --> 24:33.325
He's here? The bomber?

24:33.327 --> 24:34.626
- That's what she says.
- Whoa. Hey.

24:34.628 --> 24:38.431
Everyone, we all just need
to calm down, okay?

24:39.012 --> 24:40.566
Thank you.

24:42.269 --> 24:44.402
You have got
a very, very big mouth.

24:44.404 --> 24:46.304
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know what?

24:46.306 --> 24:47.505
That that information would fan

24:47.507 --> 24:48.840
an already-out-of-control flame?

24:48.842 --> 24:51.209
- No, she was just trying to...
- You stay out of this.

24:51.211 --> 24:54.245
If we weren't overwhelmed,
you'd be done.

24:54.247 --> 24:55.948
Understood?

24:57.551 --> 24:59.585
Both of you get back to work.

24:59.587 --> 25:02.220
Not out there.

25:02.222 --> 25:04.389
Dr. Miller, I'm so sorry.

25:04.391 --> 25:05.457
Not as sorry as you're gonna be

25:05.459 --> 25:07.368
if this gets any more out of control.

25:09.127 --> 25:11.829
We managed to divert half
a dozen more critical cases

25:11.831 --> 25:13.297
- to the General.
- Nice.

25:13.299 --> 25:14.565
What about the code omega?

25:14.567 --> 25:16.033
Well, mississauga's
coming through big-time.

25:16.035 --> 25:18.102
Blood, plasma, albumin
should all be here soon.

25:18.104 --> 25:19.804
Finally, some light
at the end of the tunnel.

25:19.806 --> 25:21.906
They said he's in the O.R.
I know where it is. Come on.

25:21.908 --> 25:23.941
Call security.

25:23.943 --> 25:25.609
Word has officially hit
the streets.

25:25.611 --> 25:27.781
Picked a hell of a week
to start back.

25:34.086 --> 25:35.986
Hang in there.

25:35.988 --> 25:37.387
Imaging's still jammed, Dr. Lin.

25:37.389 --> 25:38.427
Hey, did you tell them how concerned I am?

25:38.467 --> 25:40.890
- I did. There's just too many other...
- We don't have any more time.

25:40.892 --> 25:43.893
- What's wrong?
- Your leg is still oozing blood, Shelby.

25:43.895 --> 25:45.629
Okay, but that's not
my primary concern right now.

25:45.781 --> 25:46.507
What is?

25:46.573 --> 25:48.832
The placental abruption
is causing us problems.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.133
Your blood won't clot,

25:50.135 --> 25:52.201
so I want to deliver the
placenta as soon as possible.

25:52.203 --> 25:54.270
She needs F.F.P.
and platelets immediately.

25:54.272 --> 25:57.040
We're gonna get Mrs. Hart
up to an O.R. now to deliver.

25:57.042 --> 25:58.975
Do you know what's gonna
happen to my baby?

25:58.977 --> 26:00.343
We're gonna do
everything we can.

26:00.345 --> 26:02.245
Look, I know you're upset,
but if Dr. Katz was here,

26:02.247 --> 26:03.346
she would tell you
to do the same.

26:03.348 --> 26:05.581
- I have to wait for Adam.
- Shelby...

26:05.583 --> 26:07.684
Maggie's the one who helped you

26:07.686 --> 26:08.752
after the bomb went off, right?

26:10.321 --> 26:12.922
She pinkie-sweared that the baby
and I were gonna be okay.

26:13.524 --> 26:14.624
I did?

26:17.112 --> 26:18.393
Of course I did.

26:18.395 --> 26:19.695
Let me keep that promise.

26:19.697 --> 26:21.496
Let her take you to the O.R.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.300
Okay, find Adam for me, please.

26:26.354 --> 26:28.137
After I help Dr. Lin move you.

26:28.139 --> 26:29.905
Okay.

26:34.779 --> 26:36.812
Okay.

26:36.814 --> 26:40.447
Well, it looks like the residual
liver is holding its own.

26:40.449 --> 26:41.983
How's our blood supply, Dr. Sharpe?

26:41.985 --> 26:43.317
I wouldn't dawdle.

26:43.319 --> 26:46.120
We're not. The O.R. is needed.

26:46.122 --> 26:47.421
Yeah, by his victims.

26:47.423 --> 26:49.256
It'd be a tragedy, huh,
if one of them were to die

26:49.258 --> 26:50.758
- while you operated on him?
- You know what?

26:50.760 --> 26:52.560
You've mastered the
sit-in-the-corner part, detective.

26:52.562 --> 26:56.197
Let's try working
on the staying quiet, please.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.034
There he is.

27:00.036 --> 27:02.203
Oh, hell. They know he's here.

27:02.205 --> 27:03.970
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Take it easy!

27:03.972 --> 27:06.039
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

27:06.041 --> 27:09.042
I need you all to back off!
Back off! Right now!

27:09.044 --> 27:10.678
Steady, Reid.

27:10.680 --> 27:12.413
You're doing
the right thing here.

27:12.415 --> 27:15.249
I'm not so sure.

27:20.589 --> 27:23.089
I need everyone to calm
the hell down right now

27:23.091 --> 27:24.424
and back off!

27:24.426 --> 27:27.059
You're operating on the bomber
when innocent people are hurt!

27:27.061 --> 27:28.461
Get him out of the O.R.!

27:28.463 --> 27:30.062
You guys are operating
on the man who did this?

27:30.064 --> 27:31.764
I don't know, Shelby.

27:31.766 --> 27:34.267
Let's go.

27:34.269 --> 27:35.735
I am Dr. Bell! Hey! Hey!

27:35.737 --> 27:37.203
And I am
the chief of surgery here!

27:37.205 --> 27:40.506
- And you need to back off now!
- He's a killer.

27:40.508 --> 27:42.374
Whether or not
the person in that room

27:42.376 --> 27:45.043
is responsible for today's
tragedy is irrelevant.

27:45.045 --> 27:48.513
This is a hospital,
not a court of law.

27:49.302 --> 27:51.383
Going in there
and tearing him to pieces

27:51.385 --> 27:52.851
is not gonna change anything.

27:52.853 --> 27:54.319
It's just gonna make
a bad day worse,

27:54.321 --> 27:56.888
and nobody here needs that.

27:56.890 --> 27:59.057
Now, if you have a problem
with my decision,

27:59.059 --> 28:01.159
you can register
a formal complaint.

28:01.161 --> 28:03.094
Do I make myself clear?

28:04.347 --> 28:05.529
Now go.

28:06.154 --> 28:07.899
Please.

28:16.425 --> 28:18.994
I think
it's calming down out there.

28:19.597 --> 28:22.816
Good, 'cause we've got a patient
here who needs our focus.

28:24.133 --> 28:25.667
You're my hero, Reid.
You know that?

28:25.669 --> 28:27.401
I think you're alone in that.

28:27.403 --> 28:28.636
Oh, no.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.305
Charlie will be proud.

28:31.307 --> 28:32.874
Let's do this.

28:32.876 --> 28:34.175
The sooner we finish here,

28:34.177 --> 28:37.011
the sooner we can make room
for the next patient.

28:38.844 --> 28:40.481
Please, listen to me.

28:40.483 --> 28:43.217
I've learned that not
all spirits are benign.

28:43.219 --> 28:44.485
There are darker ones

28:44.487 --> 28:46.554
that are attracted
to our negative energy.

28:46.556 --> 28:48.489
You're saying it's me?
I'm... I'm the problem?

28:48.491 --> 28:50.491
- You misunderstand me.
- How am I misunderstanding you?

28:50.493 --> 28:52.159
- Charlie, please.
- No, no, just let her finish.

28:52.161 --> 28:53.694
Let her explain herself.
How am I the problem?

28:53.696 --> 28:55.028
If you can't see what we have
as a gift,

28:55.030 --> 28:56.463
then it can turn into a curse.

28:56.465 --> 28:58.832
What kind of gift
would threaten my family?

28:58.834 --> 29:01.735
Sometimes what we experience
comes with a price.

29:01.737 --> 29:03.070
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

29:03.072 --> 29:04.205
- Charlie.
- Just...

29:08.511 --> 29:10.311
Medic! Medic!

29:12.414 --> 29:14.113
Charlie? Charlie!

29:18.085 --> 29:20.052
Charlie, what just happened?

29:25.158 --> 29:26.158
I don't know.

29:26.160 --> 29:28.027
What did you see?

29:28.029 --> 29:29.729
I don't know. I need to go.

29:29.731 --> 29:32.265
Charlie, talk to me, please.
It's important.

29:32.267 --> 29:35.468
Charlie, please. Talk to me.

29:35.470 --> 29:37.469
I can't, okay? Just...

29:37.471 --> 29:38.803
- Not right now.
- I just...

29:38.805 --> 29:39.838
I wanted you to meet her

29:39.840 --> 29:42.107
so you'd know
we're not alone in this.

29:42.109 --> 29:44.776
Look, I get it. I do, okay?

29:44.778 --> 29:47.579
I was up half the night,
and I just...

29:52.377 --> 29:54.553
What did you see, Charlie?

29:54.555 --> 29:55.721
Nothing.

29:56.348 --> 29:59.624
When I touched you,
I saw a flash of...

29:59.626 --> 30:02.092
things I don't understand.

30:02.094 --> 30:03.794
What are you talking about?

30:03.796 --> 30:04.862
I did, Charlie.

30:04.864 --> 30:07.298
I felt a connection.

30:08.249 --> 30:09.233
What does it mean?

30:10.536 --> 30:12.536
I don't know. I...

30:12.538 --> 30:13.738
What the hell?

30:14.318 --> 30:15.573
What is it?

30:15.575 --> 30:17.040
I have to go.

30:24.583 --> 30:25.982
We are not gonna be able
to close.

30:25.984 --> 30:27.284
It's too swollen.

30:27.286 --> 30:28.518
Let's leave it open.

30:28.520 --> 30:30.052
No doubt we'll be back
in there mucking about,

30:30.054 --> 30:31.321
given the extent
of these injuries.

30:31.323 --> 30:34.324
Put a temporary covering
over the incision,

30:34.326 --> 30:36.058
and let's use mesh.

30:36.060 --> 30:37.394
We'll sew it in
when you're ready.

30:37.396 --> 30:39.629
How long
you think, Dr. Reid?

30:39.631 --> 30:41.864
The O.R. is almost yours, Dev.

30:41.866 --> 30:43.332
Great, 'cause we've got
a pregnant woman

30:43.334 --> 30:45.201
we need to get in here.

30:45.203 --> 30:47.034
Is that Maggie's patient?

30:54.678 --> 30:56.946
So, that's him.

30:56.948 --> 30:58.981
The guy who set off the bomb.

31:00.173 --> 31:02.178
Not what you expected, is he?

31:06.901 --> 31:09.490
Shelby... You okay?

31:09.492 --> 31:11.592
Aw, Shelby.

31:11.594 --> 31:13.661
No, no, no, no, no.

31:13.663 --> 31:14.996
What? What is it?

31:14.998 --> 31:16.231
Dr. Reid's almost finished.

31:16.233 --> 31:17.699
Okay. Her pressure is dropping.

31:17.701 --> 31:19.034
I need clotting factors
right now.

31:19.036 --> 31:20.768
Okay, I'll call down to the lab,
get them sent up.

31:20.770 --> 31:22.637
Okay. I know this is hard.

31:22.639 --> 31:24.172
We're gonna be
in the O.R. shortly.

31:24.174 --> 31:26.341
Yeah, after they save the guy
who did this to her.

31:27.644 --> 31:28.909
Look, no one's
picking up in the lab.

31:28.911 --> 31:30.110
- Do you want me to just go get it?
- No.

31:30.112 --> 31:31.178
I know exactly where they are.

31:31.180 --> 31:32.479
It's gonna be quicker.

31:32.481 --> 31:34.181
Just, as soon as the O.R.'s
open, get her in there, okay?

31:34.183 --> 31:35.249
- Sure.
- Got it?

31:35.251 --> 31:36.851
Okay.

31:36.853 --> 31:37.985
All right, let's begin.

31:37.987 --> 31:39.386
Is it true that the man
who set the bomb off

31:39.388 --> 31:41.155
was treated in Hope Zion?

31:41.157 --> 31:43.991
The police have informed me that
they have a suspect in custody.

31:43.993 --> 31:45.392
Beyond that, I can't speculate.

31:45.394 --> 31:46.927
Was he given treatment
ahead of other patients?

31:46.929 --> 31:48.228
I've been assured

31:48.230 --> 31:50.296
that all of our protocols
have been strictly followed,

31:50.298 --> 31:52.999
but you're missing
the real story here.

31:53.001 --> 31:55.569
I'm so proud of all
of the people at Hope Zion

31:55.571 --> 31:58.538
and all of the... the courage
and the character

31:58.540 --> 32:00.374
that they've demonstrated
through this crisis.

32:00.376 --> 32:01.675
Yes, you're right.

32:01.677 --> 32:04.177
Character is so important.

32:04.179 --> 32:05.311
Next question.

32:05.313 --> 32:07.080
Tell us more
about the doctors

32:07.082 --> 32:08.281
that were instrumental
in helping.

32:08.283 --> 32:09.715
I'll take that.

32:09.717 --> 32:11.884
Uh, I think
we have a great team here.

32:11.886 --> 32:14.186
At the head,
we've got Dr. Alex Reid...

32:21.395 --> 32:22.862
It's what we call it.

32:22.864 --> 32:24.697
What? No thank you?

32:24.699 --> 32:27.065
Thought I did
a pretty good job back there.

32:27.067 --> 32:29.200
Last time I checked,
that's what you get paid for.

32:29.202 --> 32:30.902
So, you're welcome.

32:30.904 --> 32:33.237
I hear you gave a pretty
rousing speech yourself

32:33.239 --> 32:34.439
out in front of the O.R.

32:34.441 --> 32:36.508
Things were out of control.
I stepped in.

32:36.510 --> 32:38.910
Yeah, moving forward, it's
gonna be best for the hospital

32:38.912 --> 32:41.746
if you just, uh,
keep your mouth shut.

32:41.748 --> 32:44.048
Good for everyone involved.

32:44.050 --> 32:45.550
I just want to get back to work.

32:45.552 --> 32:46.651
I do have to admit, though, Dawn,

32:46.653 --> 32:48.351
you standing there,
looking so pretty,

32:48.353 --> 32:49.686
did work to our advantage.

32:49.688 --> 32:51.755
Stop following me.

32:51.757 --> 32:53.290
Oh, Dawn.

32:53.292 --> 32:55.426
Dawn, what happened to us?

32:56.961 --> 32:59.095
I have nothing more
to say to you.

32:59.097 --> 33:00.631
Wait, is this 'cause of Asha?

33:00.633 --> 33:02.766
Oh, God. That must be
so awkward for you.

33:02.768 --> 33:03.967
I get it.

33:03.969 --> 33:06.502
I apologize if we've
been less than discreet.

33:06.504 --> 33:08.070
I've got my eyes on you.

33:08.072 --> 33:09.171
Oh, what's that supposed to mean?

33:09.173 --> 33:10.640
What do you think it means?

33:10.642 --> 33:12.809
I have no idea what that... that...

33:12.811 --> 33:14.677
Look at that.

33:14.679 --> 33:15.812
There she is... Asha.

33:15.814 --> 33:17.413
Asha's calling.

33:17.415 --> 33:18.881
I think I'm gonna take this.

33:18.883 --> 33:21.216
See you around, chief.

33:21.218 --> 33:23.085
Just let me know
when the test comes back, then.

33:23.087 --> 33:24.153
Oh, Dr. Lin.

33:24.155 --> 33:25.621
- Yeah?
- Uh, are you all right?

33:25.623 --> 33:26.755
Yeah, long day.

33:26.757 --> 33:28.223
You're pretty close
with Dr. Miller, right?

33:28.225 --> 33:29.425
Two peas in a pod.

33:29.427 --> 33:31.026
Do you think maybe
you could put in a good word?

33:31.028 --> 33:34.863
I accidentally exposed the
identity of the... the bomber,

33:34.865 --> 33:37.499
and I'm worried that I might
have burnt a major bridge there.

33:37.501 --> 33:38.867
Okay, I'll see what I can do.

33:38.869 --> 33:41.003
Right now I have to get clotting
factors for my patient.

33:41.005 --> 33:42.171
Oh, okay.

33:42.173 --> 33:44.006
Best way to get back
in Zach's good books...

33:44.008 --> 33:45.808
Work harder.

33:46.296 --> 33:47.475
Thanks.

33:49.678 --> 33:52.513
Clean-up, O.R. 7.
Clean-up, O.R. 7.

33:52.515 --> 33:53.747
Where are you taking him?

33:53.749 --> 33:54.849
To the I.C.U.

33:54.851 --> 33:56.384
- I'll escort you there.
- There's no need,

33:56.386 --> 33:57.952
unless you think
he's gonna try and escape.

33:57.954 --> 33:59.687
No, I think someone
might try to kill him,

33:59.689 --> 34:01.456
and I wouldn't want you
to become collateral damage.

34:01.458 --> 34:02.923
Let's go, doctor.

34:02.925 --> 34:04.552
You can thank me later.

34:07.029 --> 34:08.094
Hey, where's Dr. Lin?

34:08.097 --> 34:09.362
I thought
she was delivering the baby.

34:09.364 --> 34:11.425
She went to get more F.F.P.

34:12.322 --> 34:13.667
You ever deliver a baby?

34:13.668 --> 34:15.731
Technically? No.

34:16.152 --> 34:18.973
Okay, you okay if I scrub back
in, just till she returns?

34:18.975 --> 34:20.574
If you'd like to, Dr. Bishop.

34:20.576 --> 34:22.710
I'm sure she'll be back soon.

34:25.480 --> 34:27.147
Where is it?

34:27.149 --> 34:29.081
Come on.

34:31.952 --> 34:33.386
Yes.

34:33.388 --> 34:35.021
Aah!

34:35.023 --> 34:36.188
Aah. Oh!

34:53.025 --> 34:54.322
Her pressure's dangerously low.

34:54.388 --> 34:56.248
Yeah, she is not in good shape.

34:56.295 --> 34:58.061
The placenta's got to go... now.

34:58.063 --> 34:59.896
Should I send someone
to look for Dr. Lin?

34:59.898 --> 35:02.032
No, she probably got caught up
with another patient,

35:02.034 --> 35:03.734
and either way, this can't wait.

35:03.736 --> 35:05.736
Ready to deliver a baby?

35:05.738 --> 35:06.737
Let's do it.

35:06.739 --> 35:08.639
Good man.

35:10.142 --> 35:11.275
Good news.

35:11.277 --> 35:13.143
Our boat's floating
on red blood cells.

35:13.145 --> 35:14.677
Mississauga Memorial came through.

35:14.679 --> 35:16.746
Great. Let's get it up
to the O.R. ASAP

35:16.748 --> 35:19.215
and take our junior resident
with you.

35:19.990 --> 35:21.771
She still in your doghouse?

35:21.916 --> 35:22.685
Woof.

35:22.687 --> 35:23.520
Ouch.

35:26.257 --> 35:28.258
Zach says
you're on blood bag duty.

35:28.260 --> 35:30.226
- Oh, he hates me.
- No, don't worry.

35:30.228 --> 35:32.328
His bark is way worse than his bite.

35:40.536 --> 35:42.137
Oh. Please.
I'm looking for my daughter.

35:42.139 --> 35:43.938
She was in the run today.

35:43.940 --> 35:46.241
I've already been to half
a dozen hospitals already.

35:46.243 --> 35:48.577
Please. Have you seen my Lily?

35:48.579 --> 35:49.645
I'm sorry. I haven't.

35:49.647 --> 35:50.646
Does she have a ring like that?

35:50.648 --> 35:52.781
Yes. Have you seen her?

35:52.783 --> 35:54.349
I'm not sure.

35:54.351 --> 35:55.483
Let me make some inquiries,

35:55.485 --> 35:57.085
and I'll get back to you
as soon as I can, okay?

35:57.087 --> 35:59.220
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

35:59.816 --> 36:01.489
You got something for him?

36:01.491 --> 36:03.091
I really hope I don't.

36:15.204 --> 36:16.470
Dr. Mirani.

36:16.472 --> 36:18.138
Dr. Miller's looking for you.

36:18.140 --> 36:19.907
Okay.

36:23.377 --> 36:25.345
Are you all right?

36:25.347 --> 36:27.147
Yeah, it's just a lot, you know?

36:27.781 --> 36:29.649
You're handling it well.

36:29.651 --> 36:31.304
Keep up the good work.

36:32.821 --> 36:35.473
Those look nasty.
Have you had them checked out?

36:35.868 --> 36:36.990
What?

36:36.992 --> 36:39.197
Your bruises. Did you get
those from the explosion?

36:39.488 --> 36:41.095
Um...

36:41.097 --> 36:42.957
Yeah, I guess they are.

36:44.751 --> 36:46.941
You don't remember?

36:47.435 --> 36:49.235
Um...

36:49.237 --> 36:50.903
I should get to work.

36:53.607 --> 36:57.409
Lane didn't have anything
to do with those, did he?

36:57.411 --> 37:00.346
- Dr. Bell, I know you and Lane had a
- Don't.

37:00.348 --> 37:03.611
- And you're my boss, so...
- That's not what this is about.

37:04.257 --> 37:06.443
So, then what is it about?

37:14.121 --> 37:15.981
Is he hurting you?

37:18.464 --> 37:20.866
Dr. Miller's looking for me,
so...

37:20.868 --> 37:22.467
I should get to work.

37:31.510 --> 37:33.444
How we doing
on the O neg situation?

37:33.446 --> 37:35.946
Hey.
We're actually swimming in it.

37:35.948 --> 37:37.382
Everybody
really stepped up today.

37:37.384 --> 37:39.350
Code omega's officially over.

37:39.352 --> 37:40.585
Amen to that.

37:40.587 --> 37:41.919
All right,
well, let's share the wealth.

37:41.921 --> 37:44.656
- Send some to Mississauga.
- Mm. Good call.

37:45.825 --> 37:47.921
You should be proud
of your staff.

37:48.224 --> 37:49.560
I always am.

37:49.562 --> 37:51.195
I know. I just mean today.

37:51.197 --> 37:52.496
You know, they really
pulled it together.

37:52.498 --> 37:54.230
Rolled up their sleeves...
Literally.

37:54.232 --> 37:56.199
Just 'cause they wanted
some cookies and juice?

37:56.201 --> 37:58.535
No. It's because they have
a fearless leader

37:58.537 --> 38:00.771
they can get behind.

38:01.124 --> 38:03.907
It was a great call
on the internal blood bank.

38:04.580 --> 38:06.476
Thanks, chief.

38:06.823 --> 38:09.263
We've got to look after
each other, right?

38:10.451 --> 38:11.548
Right.

38:11.550 --> 38:12.683
Right.

38:13.627 --> 38:14.918
Well...

38:14.920 --> 38:16.252
I got to go eat
a sandwich or something.

38:16.254 --> 38:17.754
I feel like I haven't eaten
since Tuesday.

38:25.729 --> 38:28.297
Yes, it is.

38:28.299 --> 38:29.699
Yes, what is?

38:29.701 --> 38:32.901
Handcuffing him is necessary.

38:32.903 --> 38:34.704
Actually, I was wondering

38:34.706 --> 38:36.839
how you could be so sure
this was him.

38:36.841 --> 38:38.273
He was caught on CCTV...

38:38.275 --> 38:41.243
That, uh, picture I showed you.

38:41.245 --> 38:42.845
He didn't even try
to hide the fact

38:42.847 --> 38:45.247
that he planted a bomb
to kill all those people.

38:45.249 --> 38:46.615
Who is he?

38:46.617 --> 38:49.652
We don't know yet, but we will.

38:49.654 --> 38:51.653
His photo's all over the web.

38:52.437 --> 38:55.286
How could anybody
do something like this?

38:55.774 --> 38:58.703
You having second thoughts about
saving his life, Dr. Reid?

39:02.565 --> 39:04.687
I'm needed in the O.R.

39:06.059 --> 39:08.816
Ironic, putting a guard
on his door to keep him safe.

39:08.962 --> 39:11.005
I took an oath, too...

39:11.007 --> 39:13.051
Whether I like it or not.

39:18.348 --> 39:20.243
Detective, do you have
a minute for an update?

39:20.362 --> 39:22.617
Uh... Sure.

39:26.988 --> 39:29.022
I've ordered additional officers.

39:29.024 --> 39:32.092
The suspect's presence here
could provoke more violence.

39:32.094 --> 39:33.994
Understood.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.829
- Okay, thank you for the briefing.
- Yeah.

39:35.831 --> 39:37.865
I don't envy you your job, detective.

39:37.867 --> 39:39.132
That's okay.
I don't envy you yours.

39:40.569 --> 39:42.135
Anything else?

39:44.972 --> 39:47.673
Uh, when this crisis is done,

39:47.675 --> 39:49.542
I'd like to have a word
with you on another matter.

39:49.544 --> 39:51.826
Okay, can I ask you
what it's about?

39:54.860 --> 39:56.983
A sexual assault.

39:57.952 --> 39:59.685
I see.

40:00.221 --> 40:02.490
Can you give me
any more details?

40:02.847 --> 40:04.746
Not at this time, no.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.498
24/7. My door's always open.

40:13.577 --> 40:16.701
Doesn't have to be formal.
Just a chat, yeah?

40:17.205 --> 40:18.537
Yeah.

41:07.119 --> 41:08.553
What's her status?

41:08.555 --> 41:10.154
Shrapnel in the leg
wouldn't stop bleeding.

41:10.156 --> 41:11.589
Placental abruption caused D.I.C.,

41:11.591 --> 41:12.923
and they're about to deliver now.

41:12.925 --> 41:14.792
Make sure you get an orthopod in
to take a look at that leg.

41:24.504 --> 41:25.536
Hey, how are we doing?

41:25.538 --> 41:26.804
I'll tell you when we're done.

41:28.608 --> 41:29.840
Almost at the womb.

41:29.842 --> 41:31.042
Is Charlie back yet?

41:33.912 --> 41:35.703
How can I help?

41:40.652 --> 41:41.784
Could you take that?

41:41.786 --> 41:43.053
Maggie.

41:43.055 --> 41:45.389
What can I do?
Where can I help the most?

41:45.391 --> 41:46.689
Charlie?

41:51.551 --> 41:53.663
Maggie.

41:53.665 --> 41:55.398
What happened?

41:55.867 --> 41:58.100
I don't know.

42:17.974 --> 42:20.877
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

42:30.494 --> 42:32.601
I feel weird.

42:32.802 --> 42:34.619
It's because you're a ghost.

42:36.238 --> 42:37.338
It's been a brutal day.

42:37.540 --> 42:38.840
First came the bomb.

42:39.042 --> 42:39.675
Ahh!

42:39.876 --> 42:42.010
Now comes the fallout.

42:42.211 --> 42:43.178
Maggie.

42:43.379 --> 42:43.946
What happened?

42:44.146 --> 42:44.713
Where are you?

42:44.914 --> 42:45.747
She's in trouble.

42:45.949 --> 42:47.215
Page shahir, we need him now!

42:47.416 --> 42:48.050
Charlie.

42:48.250 --> 42:49.818
Go to Maggie.

42:50.019 --> 42:50.985
Now.

42:51.186 --> 42:54.655
You need to fight, for your life.

42:55.624 --> 42:57.825
Part two of an all-new Saving Hope.
