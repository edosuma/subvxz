Okay.

00:30.724 --> 00:31.344
Okay.

01:25.655 --> 01:27.689
Oh no no.

01:29.172 --> 01:30.034
No no no!

01:30.620 --> 01:31.275
Okay.

01:54.793 --> 01:55.896
Why now? Why now?
Why now?

01:55.896 --> 01:56.931
Pick up! Pick up!

02:05.896 --> 02:06.551
[whispering] Yes.

02:08.310 --> 02:09.655
What the
hell are you doing?

02:09.655 --> 02:10.551
Get out of
my house!

02:10.551 --> 02:11.379
I don't want
any trouble!

02:11.379 --> 02:12.379
Whoah!

02:12.517 --> 02:13.517
Aghhh!

02:18.689 --> 02:19.482
Hi.

02:20.758 --> 02:21.655
Nice day.

02:24.379 --> 02:25.482
Ahh!

02:34.655 --> 02:35.448
Oh my God!

02:35.448 --> 02:36.965
- We've got to go!
- Oh my God!

02:36.965 --> 02:38.103
No no no!
Okay!

02:38.103 --> 02:39.034
What happened
to your hand?

02:39.827 --> 02:40.620
Okay!

02:40.620 --> 02:41.862
We've got to go!
We've got to go!

03:02.241 --> 03:03.344
Okay.

03:04.413 --> 03:05.206
Charlie, count the shrimp.

03:05.206 --> 03:06.034
Huh?

03:06.034 --> 03:06.896
No seriously,
count the shrimp.

03:06.896 --> 03:07.931
Sometimes they'll short you.

03:09.103 --> 03:10.103
I will not be
doing that.

03:10.689 --> 03:11.448
Okay!

03:12.137 --> 03:13.137
Whose phone is that?

03:13.137 --> 03:14.103
Oh!

03:14.103 --> 03:15.241
Save some for me.

03:16.931 --> 03:17.827
You in, Joe?

03:17.827 --> 03:18.896
What
have we got here?

03:18.896 --> 03:20.206
Ooh, did he get
General Tso's?

03:20.206 --> 03:20.896
Dinnertime.

03:20.896 --> 03:21.862
Come on pal.

03:22.620 --> 03:23.724
Man, I'm hungry.

03:26.655 --> 03:27.310
Jesse?

03:27.310 --> 03:28.689
Everything okay?

03:28.896 --> 03:30.896
It's my sister Crystal.

03:31.586 --> 03:32.655
Jesse.

03:32.655 --> 03:34.586
Jesse, I am in
big trouble.

03:34.724 --> 03:36.413
I'm not sure
what to do.

03:36.413 --> 03:39.310
Look, can you
come here?

03:39.310 --> 03:40.965
And no cops Jesse.

03:40.965 --> 03:41.758
No cops.

03:41.758 --> 03:42.448
I'm serious.

03:43.896 --> 03:45.310
She's still not answering?

03:46.068 --> 03:46.758
No.

03:46.758 --> 03:47.793
No but you
know what?

03:47.793 --> 03:49.862
It's not unusual for her
to get into trouble, so-

03:49.862 --> 03:51.620
Where is she?

03:51.620 --> 03:53.068
Northern Ontario,
last I checked.

03:53.068 --> 03:55.896
Do you know anyone who could
possibly go in and check on her?

03:55.896 --> 03:57.206
Make sure she's okay?

03:57.206 --> 03:59.241
I haven't really been in touch
with anybody there in a while.

03:59.241 --> 04:01.482
Yeah she's not answering.

04:02.034 --> 04:02.655
You know what?

04:02.655 --> 04:03.448
Um-

04:04.482 --> 04:06.344
Joe is it okay if I
take a few days off?

04:06.344 --> 04:07.448
Jesse, no of course.

04:07.448 --> 04:08.620
You do what
you have to do.

04:08.620 --> 04:09.551
Family first.

04:09.551 --> 04:10.344
Always.

04:10.344 --> 04:11.689
You shouldn't go alone.

04:11.689 --> 04:12.758
You want to
go with him?

04:14.379 --> 04:15.517
I was thinking you.

04:15.517 --> 04:16.620
And Rex.

04:16.724 --> 04:18.379
If she's missing,
Rex'll find her.

04:18.379 --> 04:20.034
I've got some stuff
I've got to do here.

04:21.310 --> 04:22.413
Okay.

04:22.413 --> 04:24.275
Joe, do you mind if Rex
and I tag along with Jesse?

04:24.275 --> 04:26.000
No of course not.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.034
Rex will be
a great help.

04:27.034 --> 04:28.241
There's a flight
in a few hours.

04:28.241 --> 04:29.275
I think we
can make it.

04:29.689 --> 04:30.586
Yeah?
Yeah.

04:30.586 --> 04:31.517
Okay thanks guys!

04:31.517 --> 04:32.275
I really appreciate it.

04:32.379 --> 04:33.689
Okay what do
you think Rex?

04:33.689 --> 04:35.793
Gonna get a
seat on the plane?

04:36.379 --> 04:37.275
Be safe.

04:37.275 --> 04:38.379
I mean it's
probably all right.

04:38.379 --> 04:39.344
Knowing Crystal-

04:39.344 --> 04:41.310
she's just making a
big deal out of nothing.

05:22.241 --> 05:23.034
Hey Sidney!

05:23.034 --> 05:24.586
What are you
doing here?

05:24.586 --> 05:26.344
Well news travels
fast in this town.

05:26.344 --> 05:28.758
And it got me
out of the house.

05:29.000 --> 05:29.896
Look.

05:29.896 --> 05:32.241
It's another death
related to Basal Mining.

05:32.862 --> 05:33.862
Sidney.

05:33.862 --> 05:35.620
It's gone from Basal's
environmental engineer-

05:35.620 --> 05:38.862
to targeting the head of
operations of Northern Ontario.

05:38.862 --> 05:41.586
His wife, Bianca Cooper,
is the victim here.

05:41.586 --> 05:42.344
Tell me.

05:42.344 --> 05:43.379
What happened?

05:43.379 --> 05:44.275
It was just
a break-in.

05:44.275 --> 05:45.758
Bianca Cooper was home.

05:45.758 --> 05:47.448
She seems to have
surprised the intruder.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.206
There was a scuffle.

05:48.206 --> 05:49.172
She got shot.

05:49.172 --> 05:50.344
They take anything?

05:50.344 --> 05:51.344
Just some electronics.

05:51.344 --> 05:52.000
Knick knacks.

05:52.000 --> 05:52.862
Knick knacks?

05:52.862 --> 05:54.000
Where's the body?

05:54.758 --> 05:56.413
In the office upstairs.

05:56.413 --> 05:57.103
Now remember-

05:57.103 --> 05:58.310
I'm not here officially.

05:58.827 --> 06:00.000
Well you should be.

06:00.000 --> 06:00.758
Sidney.

06:04.896 --> 06:06.517
It's been two months.

06:06.517 --> 06:07.241
Six weeks.

06:09.068 --> 06:10.931
Well I think work could
be good for you.

06:10.931 --> 06:13.793
I am not there
yet boss.

06:25.620 --> 06:27.655
Canvass the rest
of the neighbours.

06:27.655 --> 06:29.551
And put the description of
the car out on the radio.

06:52.379 --> 06:53.137
Detective Scott.

06:55.517 --> 06:57.448
I uh-

06:57.448 --> 06:58.586
didn't know
you were back.

06:58.586 --> 06:59.448
Don't worry, Kai.

06:59.448 --> 07:01.206
I'm not going
to take your case.

07:01.206 --> 07:02.379
I'm not on
my game.

07:02.482 --> 07:03.068
Good!

07:03.379 --> 07:04.827
I mean-

07:07.482 --> 07:09.689
I'm sure you've got it
under control Officer.

07:09.689 --> 07:10.551
Without me.

07:10.551 --> 07:12.068
It's Detective now.

07:12.068 --> 07:14.310
Detective, fourth class.

07:14.551 --> 07:15.793
Congratulations.

07:16.103 --> 07:16.827
Thanks!

07:16.931 --> 07:18.000
Mr. Cooper is-?

07:19.206 --> 07:20.862
He's out back,
I believe.

07:22.310 --> 07:24.034
I expect we're
looking for addicts-

07:24.034 --> 07:26.068
trying to find something
worth stealing.

07:26.068 --> 07:29.034
Already started uniforms
looking for the usual suspects.

07:31.206 --> 07:31.896
Addicts?

07:34.862 --> 07:36.413
This far from downtown?

07:37.827 --> 07:39.068
They had a car.

07:39.068 --> 07:40.896
A neighbour walking their
dog gave us a description

07:40.896 --> 07:42.827
of the driver
and the car.

07:42.827 --> 07:45.275
They drove to this
particular house?

07:45.275 --> 07:48.896
But then walked right past the
victim's purse and jewellery-

07:48.896 --> 07:51.413
and came all the way up the
stairs to an office in the back?

07:51.413 --> 07:54.275
I mean, almost like
they knew it was here?

07:59.206 --> 07:59.896
Tim.

08:04.172 --> 08:05.137
Sidney.

08:07.965 --> 08:09.103
Good of
you to come.

08:10.655 --> 08:12.137
I haven't seen
you since-

08:12.137 --> 08:12.896
Daniel's funeral.

08:12.896 --> 08:15.379
I'm so sorry
about your wife.

08:15.379 --> 08:18.551
Did you see her?

08:18.551 --> 08:19.689
Do you think
she suffered?

08:22.172 --> 08:23.344
I think the shot
killed her instantly.

08:24.896 --> 08:26.862
But you should
know that-

08:26.862 --> 08:30.206
I think she encountered
the intruder-

08:30.206 --> 08:32.068
and there
was a struggle.

08:35.137 --> 08:36.620
I should have
been here.

08:38.206 --> 08:40.310
You were
at the office?

08:40.310 --> 08:42.862
You can't blame yourself.

08:42.862 --> 08:43.620
Did you receive-

08:43.620 --> 08:44.965
any more threats
on your life?

08:44.965 --> 08:45.620
No.

08:45.620 --> 08:47.620
No, not
in a while.

08:47.620 --> 08:48.724
The other-

08:48.724 --> 08:50.862
The other detective said
it looked like a robbery.

08:52.310 --> 08:53.000
Well it could be.

08:54.241 --> 08:55.379
Will you investigate?

08:55.379 --> 08:57.448
No.

08:57.448 --> 08:59.206
No, I'm
still on leave.

08:59.827 --> 09:01.448
Inspector Ali- he
has a good team.

09:01.448 --> 09:02.827
They're going to
find out who did this.

09:02.827 --> 09:04.206
I promise.

09:14.827 --> 09:16.344
Yeah, I know
it's been a long time.

09:16.344 --> 09:18.103
But can you
bring it up?

09:20.034 --> 09:22.172
Constable Charlie
Hudson's incident reports-

09:22.172 --> 09:24.586
from October 30th, 2009.

09:26.275 --> 09:27.655
Is it faster if
I just came down

09:27.655 --> 09:28.724
and picked it
up myself now?

09:29.310 --> 09:30.068
Mm-hmm.

09:30.413 --> 09:31.137
Thanks.

10:07.965 --> 10:08.655
Still nothing?

10:08.655 --> 10:09.379
No.

10:09.379 --> 10:10.517
Classic Crystal.

10:10.517 --> 10:12.551
But I know where she goes
when she gets scared.

10:28.172 --> 10:29.379
Is this
the place?

10:29.379 --> 10:30.379
How long have we
been driving?

10:30.379 --> 10:31.517
Over an hour?

10:31.517 --> 10:33.068
Well this was an old
cold war missile site.

10:33.068 --> 10:34.275
So they wanted it
away from everything.

10:42.482 --> 10:44.310
You and your sister came out
here when you were kids?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.586
Yeah.

10:45.586 --> 10:47.724
Crystal would ride her bike down
here from my uncle's place.

10:47.724 --> 10:49.862
Used to build camps in one of
these abandoned buildings.

10:49.862 --> 10:51.000
I think it's
over here.

10:55.034 --> 10:55.689
Get back!

10:57.344 --> 10:58.137
Get back!

10:59.586 --> 11:00.275
Easy, Rex.

11:01.931 --> 11:02.586
Put that down!

11:02.586 --> 11:03.620
Hey why
don't you

11:03.620 --> 11:05.206
take your dog and
get back in your car?

11:05.310 --> 11:06.241
Nick!

11:07.275 --> 11:09.517
Put that stupid
thing down!

11:11.379 --> 11:12.379
This is my brother.

11:22.758 --> 11:24.551
Rex, it's okay.

11:24.551 --> 11:25.448
What is going
on here?

11:25.448 --> 11:26.827
How did he know
where to find us?

11:26.827 --> 11:28.000
He's just smart
like that, okay?

11:28.000 --> 11:29.655
I didn't think
you'd come.

11:29.655 --> 11:30.413
Of course I came.

11:30.413 --> 11:31.724
You said you
were in danger!

11:31.724 --> 11:32.551
You called him?

11:32.551 --> 11:33.827
I thought you
said he was a cop!

11:33.827 --> 11:35.551
Will you
calm the frick down?

11:35.551 --> 11:36.793
Everything's fine.

11:36.793 --> 11:38.620
I just need you to go to our
place and grab some things.

11:38.620 --> 11:40.103
Why can't you go?

11:51.724 --> 11:52.655
What about his
friends here?

11:52.655 --> 11:53.344
Are they cool?

11:53.344 --> 11:54.068
Dr. Sarah Truong.

11:54.068 --> 11:54.724
Hi.

11:54.724 --> 11:55.551
We're cool.

11:55.551 --> 11:57.068
We're just keeping
Jesse company.

11:57.068 --> 11:58.448
Can I have
a word with you-

11:58.448 --> 11:59.413
alone?

12:02.206 --> 12:03.551
Okay Crystal, what
did he get you into?

12:03.551 --> 12:05.275
Nick's a good guy.

12:05.275 --> 12:06.068
Crystal.

12:06.068 --> 12:06.758
If something happened-

12:06.758 --> 12:07.793
you need to turn
yourself in-

12:07.793 --> 12:08.793
and tell the police
what happened.

12:08.793 --> 12:09.448
No Jesse!

12:09.448 --> 12:10.206
We can't do that!

12:10.206 --> 12:10.896
He'll go to jail!

12:10.896 --> 12:11.620
Jail?

12:13.172 --> 12:14.000
For what?

12:15.620 --> 12:16.689
It was an accident.

12:16.689 --> 12:17.379
Crystal.

12:17.379 --> 12:18.620
What was an accident?

12:20.379 --> 12:21.896
Jesse, Nick
is all I've got.

12:21.896 --> 12:23.482
So are you going
to help us or not?

12:23.482 --> 12:24.517
I come all
the way here-

12:24.517 --> 12:25.551
and he's all
you've got?

12:42.206 --> 12:43.000
What is it Rex?

12:44.655 --> 12:45.689
Guys, get out
get out!

12:45.689 --> 12:46.379
Come on!

12:49.103 --> 12:50.000
The bag!

12:52.931 --> 12:53.931
Okay.

12:56.689 --> 12:57.379
Ughh!

13:00.344 --> 13:01.000
Ughh!

13:05.551 --> 13:06.206
Nick!

13:06.206 --> 13:06.896
No no no baby!

13:06.896 --> 13:07.827
No!

13:07.827 --> 13:08.517
No no!

13:08.517 --> 13:09.206
Crystal Crystal!

13:09.206 --> 13:10.379
We've got to
get out of here!

13:10.379 --> 13:11.413
Come on,
we've got to go!

13:11.413 --> 13:12.206
I can't leave him!

13:13.551 --> 13:14.206
Jesse!

13:18.793 --> 13:19.586
The airfield!

13:19.586 --> 13:21.379
That's still here?

13:35.379 --> 13:36.034
Hey!

13:36.034 --> 13:36.689
Hi Amelia.

13:36.689 --> 13:37.344
Hi.

13:37.344 --> 13:38.586
How are you?

13:38.586 --> 13:39.586
I need to
borrow your dad

13:39.586 --> 13:40.689
for a moment.

13:40.689 --> 13:43.000
I'll be just a
second okay?

13:43.000 --> 13:45.413
Can you put your headphones
on please honey?

13:50.103 --> 13:51.034
What is it?

13:51.034 --> 13:53.103
Where were you at 10
am this morning, Elvis?

13:54.448 --> 13:55.413
You tell me.

13:55.413 --> 13:57.068
Where do you think
I was this time?

13:57.068 --> 13:58.931
Did you go to Tim
Cooper's house?

13:58.931 --> 13:59.758
Yeah.

13:59.758 --> 14:01.896
He and I do brunch
every Tuesday.

14:01.896 --> 14:03.586
No I wasn't at that
scumbag's house.

14:03.689 --> 14:04.551
Hey.

14:05.206 --> 14:05.931
Mad as ever huh?

14:06.586 --> 14:07.448
You would be too.

14:07.551 --> 14:08.517
Mmm.

14:08.517 --> 14:09.448
When that mine

14:09.448 --> 14:12.000
opened upriver from
us five years ago-

14:12.000 --> 14:13.379
I had a healthy
little girl.

14:13.379 --> 14:14.620
I know.

14:14.620 --> 14:16.172
I know you think
that the mine did this.

14:16.172 --> 14:17.379
I think

14:17.379 --> 14:18.482
if anyone
listened to me

14:18.482 --> 14:20.724
when people in my community
started getting sick-

14:20.724 --> 14:22.862
she'd be in school
today and not at dialysis.

14:22.862 --> 14:24.137
Your claims
were investigated.

14:24.137 --> 14:26.000
Mine waste management
was certified clean.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.000
Yeah.

14:27.000 --> 14:30.068
Backed by reports
prepared by your husband.

14:33.413 --> 14:34.275
Look.

14:35.379 --> 14:37.034
I'm not complaining about
our visits, Detective.

14:37.034 --> 14:39.620
But you want to have this same
conversation every week?

14:41.965 --> 14:44.068
Tim Cooper's wife was
murdered this morning.

14:45.689 --> 14:47.310
That's too bad.

14:48.724 --> 14:49.758
Where were
you at 10 am?

14:49.758 --> 14:51.724
My fight is with
Tim Cooper.

14:51.724 --> 14:53.862
Why would I
hurt his wife?

14:55.379 --> 14:56.827
Account for
your time then.

14:57.724 --> 14:58.758
I was here
all day.

14:58.758 --> 15:00.482
You can ask every
nurse in this place.

15:00.482 --> 15:01.413
That's so funny.

15:01.413 --> 15:02.793
That's exactly the
same thing you said

15:02.793 --> 15:04.413
when my husband
was killed.

15:07.724 --> 15:08.517
What can I say?

15:09.310 --> 15:10.275
I'm here a lot.

15:11.275 --> 15:13.206
Mm-hmm.

15:13.206 --> 15:14.068
Well-

15:15.000 --> 15:17.103
alibi or not-

15:17.103 --> 15:19.172
we both know that you
can make this happen.

15:19.172 --> 15:21.689
You can rally a lot of
people to your cause.

15:21.689 --> 15:23.724
Yeah.

15:23.724 --> 15:25.103
Good luck proving that.

15:40.896 --> 15:41.551
This one! This one!

15:41.551 --> 15:42.241
No no no!

15:42.241 --> 15:42.896
We can't!

15:42.896 --> 15:43.758
No, this one!

15:43.758 --> 15:44.482
It's too small!

15:44.482 --> 15:45.172
Come on Rex!

15:45.172 --> 15:46.000
Come on!

15:47.206 --> 15:48.103
Rex come on!

15:50.689 --> 15:52.000
Go on, get in!

15:52.103 --> 15:52.689
Okay.

15:52.689 --> 15:54.103
Come on Rex.

15:54.103 --> 15:55.586
Come on, come on!

15:56.413 --> 15:58.310
According to the
flight simulator-

15:58.310 --> 15:59.000
it starts with this!

15:59.000 --> 15:59.758
Jesse Jesse!

15:59.758 --> 16:01.241
How are you
going to do this?

16:01.241 --> 16:02.793
What other option
do we have Sarah?

16:02.793 --> 16:04.034
How are you
going to do this?

16:04.034 --> 16:05.275
It starts
with the switch.

16:05.275 --> 16:07.620
And then there's
a red knob.

16:08.655 --> 16:09.551
It's
okay, it's okay!

16:10.310 --> 16:11.206
Come on, come on!

16:12.931 --> 16:14.758
Okay!

16:17.620 --> 16:18.275
Oh my God.

16:18.275 --> 16:19.172
Oh my God,
we're going.

16:28.379 --> 16:29.724
Fasten your seatbelts.

16:29.827 --> 16:30.965
Okay.

16:46.827 --> 16:47.517
Okay!

16:47.517 --> 16:48.448
That's not
going to help!

16:48.448 --> 16:49.793
Hurry up! Hurry up!
Hurry up! Hurry up!

16:50.137 --> 16:51.724
Come on Jesse,
come on.

16:51.724 --> 16:53.000
Everybody hold on!

16:53.000 --> 16:54.068
Woahhh!

17:08.344 --> 17:09.379
Oh my God!
- Okay!

17:09.379 --> 17:10.551
Oh my God,
you did it!

17:11.310 --> 17:12.275
I know!

17:15.896 --> 17:16.586
No.

17:16.586 --> 17:17.344
What just happened?

17:17.344 --> 17:18.034
No!

17:21.620 --> 17:22.758
Jesse!

17:22.862 --> 17:23.724
There's just some
smoke coming out!

17:23.724 --> 17:24.413
Okay?

17:25.068 --> 17:27.310
Jesse
get us up!

17:27.310 --> 17:28.413
I'm trying to
get us up!

17:32.379 --> 17:33.241
Okay hang on!

17:33.241 --> 17:34.068
Jesse!

17:34.068 --> 17:34.827
Hold on!

17:34.827 --> 17:36.724
I'm trying,
I'm trying!

17:36.724 --> 17:38.000
It's going to be okay!

17:39.103 --> 17:39.965
Everybody hold on!

17:56.551 --> 17:57.413
Rex.

17:58.862 --> 17:59.689
I know.

18:01.103 --> 18:02.000
Jesse?

18:02.724 --> 18:03.620
Oh my God, Jesse.

18:08.482 --> 18:09.137
Hey.

18:11.000 --> 18:11.689
There's a fire.

18:11.689 --> 18:13.103
We've got to
get out of here.

18:13.103 --> 18:13.827
Rex go.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.000
Go- you go first.

18:18.827 --> 18:20.344
What happened?

18:20.344 --> 18:21.379
Where are my glasses?

18:23.241 --> 18:23.931
Crystal.

18:23.931 --> 18:24.655
Crystal are you okay?

18:25.448 --> 18:26.620
We've got to
get out of here.

18:26.620 --> 18:27.344
What happened?

18:27.344 --> 18:28.517
We've got to
get out of here.

18:54.172 --> 18:55.000
Problems at work?

18:55.000 --> 18:56.137
Ah-

18:56.137 --> 18:57.241
Too much of it.

18:58.482 --> 18:59.344
Let's take a trip.

19:00.310 --> 19:01.241
What do you think?

19:01.241 --> 19:01.965
Italy?

19:02.068 --> 19:03.241
Italy?

19:03.241 --> 19:04.655
That hike we talked
about in Spain.

19:04.655 --> 19:05.620
I can't.

19:05.620 --> 19:07.000
I've got a case.

19:07.000 --> 19:08.068
A case.

19:08.172 --> 19:08.931
A case.

19:08.931 --> 19:10.241
You've always
got a case.

19:22.172 --> 19:23.172
Sidney?

19:24.448 --> 19:25.241
Sid?

19:26.758 --> 19:28.862
You down here?

19:28.862 --> 19:31.000
Hey I brought
you some food.

19:31.482 --> 19:32.310
It's upstairs.

19:35.137 --> 19:35.931
Bianca Cooper?

19:36.931 --> 19:37.724
I'm not sure

19:37.724 --> 19:38.758
this is the break
in Daniel's case

19:38.758 --> 19:39.620
you've been looking for.

19:39.620 --> 19:42.068
You don't think
that the connection

19:42.068 --> 19:44.931
to Basal Mining in these
murders is suspicious?

19:44.931 --> 19:46.758
Not without stronger evidence.

19:46.758 --> 19:48.413
Or a suspect.

19:50.206 --> 19:52.620
Elvis Migwans
has an alibi.

19:52.620 --> 19:53.448
Yeah.

19:53.448 --> 19:54.344
You searched his
place weeks ago-

19:54.344 --> 19:55.172
and found no gun.

19:55.172 --> 19:56.241
That gun-

19:56.241 --> 19:58.551
it could be in the bottom
of any number of lakes.

19:58.551 --> 19:59.862
And what good
is an alibi-

19:59.862 --> 20:01.034
if he has an
accomplice?

20:01.034 --> 20:04.275
This man is incredibly
influential in his community.

20:04.275 --> 20:05.965
Daniel was killed in
the course of a robbery.

20:05.965 --> 20:07.103
No he wasn't.

20:07.103 --> 20:07.931
Wrong place, wrong time.

20:07.931 --> 20:08.758
No he wasn't.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.172
Neither was Bianca Cooper.

20:10.172 --> 20:11.241
It's a misdirect.

20:11.241 --> 20:12.482
I know you don't
want to believe-

20:12.482 --> 20:13.793
that Daniel's death
was random.

20:13.793 --> 20:14.896
It wasn't.

20:19.724 --> 20:20.724
And if I
can't prove it-

20:20.724 --> 20:21.586
what good am I?

20:26.379 --> 20:28.206
Hey we've worked enough
cases in our careers

20:28.206 --> 20:30.137
to know you don't
always get the answers.

20:30.137 --> 20:30.827
Hmmm.

20:33.344 --> 20:35.206
Did you talk to that
therapist that I recommended?

20:36.586 --> 20:38.862
How come you never
bring me a burger?

20:38.862 --> 20:40.172
Because I care
about your health.

20:47.689 --> 20:48.344
October 30th.

20:49.551 --> 20:50.551
I figured there
was a reason

20:50.551 --> 20:52.379
you didn't volunteer
to go up North.

20:52.379 --> 20:54.586
Alison Anders.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.551
Four years old.

20:56.620 --> 21:00.103
Taken from her home
the day before Hallowe'en.

21:00.103 --> 21:01.068
No witnesses.

21:01.068 --> 21:03.793
No physical evidence
at the scene.

21:03.793 --> 21:08.862
The next day a house by house
found one of Alison's shoes-

21:08.862 --> 21:12.655
on a property owned by Trevor
Miles and Bertrand Berry.

21:12.655 --> 21:16.172
Miles was never seen
again after that night.

21:16.172 --> 21:17.655
Fourteen years
to the day.

21:17.655 --> 21:20.482
There's not a cop on this island
who doesn't know that story.

21:20.482 --> 21:22.310
I was the first
one on the scene.

21:22.310 --> 21:23.482
I missed something.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.275
I must have.

21:24.275 --> 21:25.344
And every year

21:25.344 --> 21:27.689
you scan new and old cases
looking for connections.

21:27.689 --> 21:30.172
You update her
age-enhanced photo.

21:30.172 --> 21:30.965
You interview

21:30.965 --> 21:33.000
and you re-
interview witnesses-

21:33.000 --> 21:34.551
looking for something new.

21:34.551 --> 21:36.379
What is going to
be new this year?

21:36.379 --> 21:37.103
Two days ago-

21:37.103 --> 21:38.896
Bertrand got
out of prison.

21:38.896 --> 21:40.034
He agreed
to talk to me.

21:40.034 --> 21:41.931
He agrees to meet
with you every year!

21:41.931 --> 21:43.206
He just wants
the attention.

21:43.206 --> 21:44.275
He's out of jail.

21:44.275 --> 21:46.068
Maybe this year
we can be frank.

21:51.172 --> 21:53.482
Hey how are those three
doing up there, by the way?

21:55.310 --> 21:57.413
Well fine, as
far as I know.

21:58.862 --> 21:59.689
Ow!

22:02.000 --> 22:02.655
Ughh!

22:02.758 --> 22:04.965
Ow
ow ow ow.

22:06.758 --> 22:08.172
Your wrist is
probably broken.

22:08.172 --> 22:08.931
Be careful with that.

22:08.931 --> 22:10.655
What happened?

22:10.655 --> 22:11.758
Jesse what happened?

22:11.758 --> 22:12.896
I crashed the plane.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.241
You crashed the plane.

22:14.241 --> 22:15.137
I'm so sorry
you guys.

22:15.137 --> 22:16.206
Jesse we
got shot down.

22:16.310 --> 22:17.344
It's not your fault.

22:17.344 --> 22:18.137
Yeah.

22:18.137 --> 22:19.448
Are you okay?

22:19.448 --> 22:21.172
Yeah I think
it's just my ribs.

22:21.172 --> 22:23.241
They
might be cracked.

22:23.241 --> 22:24.448
As long as your lungs
aren't punctured-

22:24.448 --> 22:25.344
you'll be fine
for now.

22:29.068 --> 22:31.379
Kai got a hit on a car that
matches the description

22:31.379 --> 22:33.000
of the one spotted outside
the Cooper place

22:33.000 --> 22:34.655
at the time
of the murder.

22:36.172 --> 22:37.000
Crystal Mills.

22:37.172 --> 22:37.931
28.

22:37.931 --> 22:39.068
She moves
around a lot.

22:39.068 --> 22:40.172
But her last
known address

22:40.172 --> 22:41.310
is out by Gateway.

22:41.310 --> 22:45.068
Nothing on her records fitting
your theory of robbery.

22:45.068 --> 22:47.965
Well Kai didn't find any recent
employment records for Mills.

22:49.275 --> 22:50.896
People get desperate.

22:50.896 --> 22:53.827
Or maybe she was dragged
into it by an accomplice.

22:55.103 --> 22:56.103
Yeah.

23:01.103 --> 23:02.482
Let me know when
you find Crystal Mills.

23:02.482 --> 23:03.758
I'm going to look
for a connection

23:03.758 --> 23:05.275
between her and
Basal Mining Group.

23:05.275 --> 23:07.068
Does this mean
that you're back?

23:18.413 --> 23:19.655
Hmmm.

23:21.448 --> 23:22.206
Yousef.

23:22.310 --> 23:23.034
Yeah.

23:23.137 --> 23:23.931
So-

23:23.931 --> 23:25.965
yeah, I've been
to Crystal's place.

23:25.965 --> 23:27.655
And I think I've got a
name for the boyfriend.

23:27.655 --> 23:28.482
Nick Weller.

23:34.448 --> 23:35.137
Hey.

23:36.034 --> 23:37.344
Call Royal Cleaners.

23:37.344 --> 23:40.241
Yeah ask them if they either
work with Nick or Crystal.

23:43.724 --> 23:45.620
I can't believe
we're alive.

23:45.620 --> 23:47.689
Okay let's-

23:47.689 --> 23:50.068
let's see if we can find the
first aid kit on the plane.

23:50.068 --> 23:51.448
I will get it.

23:51.931 --> 23:52.724
Let me get it.

23:52.724 --> 23:54.137
I saw one.

23:54.137 --> 23:54.896
It's fine.

23:55.758 --> 23:57.172
Guys there's
no cell service.

23:57.172 --> 23:57.862
I mean-

23:57.862 --> 23:59.413
that flight wasn't logged.

23:59.413 --> 24:00.689
It'll be days before
people even know

24:00.689 --> 24:01.931
that we went missing!

24:01.931 --> 24:03.655
Jesse, stay calm.

24:03.655 --> 24:05.620
I don't know
where we are!

24:05.620 --> 24:06.655
Thanks.

24:09.965 --> 24:10.862
I know.

24:10.862 --> 24:12.517
The location we
took off from.

24:12.517 --> 24:14.448
What would
you say, west?

24:15.896 --> 24:17.103
Southwest?

24:18.241 --> 24:18.931
What are you doing?

24:18.931 --> 24:19.689
No no no.

24:19.689 --> 24:20.655
You can't send
Rex out there.

24:20.655 --> 24:21.482
Come on.

24:21.482 --> 24:22.482
There are wolves
and bears-

24:22.482 --> 24:23.344
Sarah.

24:24.172 --> 24:25.103
He might get
turned around.

24:25.103 --> 24:25.931
He'll get lost.

24:25.931 --> 24:26.586
Come on.

24:26.586 --> 24:27.275
Rex, lost?

24:32.793 --> 24:33.413
Look, I'll go.

24:33.413 --> 24:34.103
Jesse.

24:34.103 --> 24:35.241
You're injured!

24:35.241 --> 24:35.965
Fine.

24:35.965 --> 24:37.413
And besides-

24:37.413 --> 24:38.137
even if you weren't-

24:38.137 --> 24:39.000
Rex can make
better time.

24:41.310 --> 24:42.448
You're going to be
careful out there.

24:42.448 --> 24:43.275
Okay?

24:43.275 --> 24:44.482
You are going
to go get help.

24:44.482 --> 24:46.344
And you are going
to come back safe!

24:46.344 --> 24:48.275
And then we're going
go home to Charlie, okay?

24:48.275 --> 24:49.068
Okay, you got it?

24:55.724 --> 24:56.413
Please be careful okay?

24:56.413 --> 24:57.103
Go go!

24:57.103 --> 24:57.793
Go get help!

25:02.724 --> 25:03.413
Go on!
Go!

26:13.758 --> 26:17.241
I didn't think it would
get this bad, Jesse.

26:17.241 --> 26:18.931
I'm so sorry!

26:18.931 --> 26:19.620
I know.

26:19.620 --> 26:21.931
We're going
to be okay.

26:21.931 --> 26:24.034
We're going to get
through this okay?

26:25.655 --> 26:26.689
Just tell me what
happened okay?

26:26.689 --> 26:27.448
What happened?

26:27.448 --> 26:28.724
You said there
was an accident.

26:28.724 --> 26:29.620
What happened?

26:29.620 --> 26:30.379
Jesse, maybe it's-

26:30.379 --> 26:31.862
You said there
was an accident.

26:31.862 --> 26:32.827
Maybe it's
not the time.

26:32.827 --> 26:34.758
Look we almost got
killed by an thug.

26:34.758 --> 26:36.241
Nick did get killed!

26:41.172 --> 26:42.448
I'm sorry.

26:45.068 --> 26:46.793
He was really
good to me, Jesse.

26:52.172 --> 26:55.172
He used to tell me funny
stories when I was down-

26:58.724 --> 27:00.517
just like
you used to.

27:01.310 --> 27:02.000
Remember?

27:02.000 --> 27:03.862
Yeah of course
I remember.

27:06.586 --> 27:07.482
It's getting late.

27:09.793 --> 27:11.310
It's going
to get dark.

27:11.310 --> 27:13.344
We should
start a fire.

27:13.344 --> 27:14.034
Yeah.

27:14.034 --> 27:15.137
Okay.

27:15.137 --> 27:16.655
Yeah I
can do that.

27:18.448 --> 27:20.655
And then I promise I
will tell you everything.

28:46.275 --> 28:47.620
Congratulations Bertrand.

28:47.620 --> 28:48.655
You're a free man.

28:48.655 --> 28:49.655
Yeah.

28:49.655 --> 28:51.172
They sent me
home to die.

28:51.793 --> 28:52.655
I take it
you're buying?

28:54.344 --> 28:55.724
Dark and Stormy sweetheart.

28:55.724 --> 28:58.551
And don't be shy
on the booze.

28:59.551 --> 29:00.724
So.

29:00.724 --> 29:02.793
What did you want
to talk to me about?

29:02.793 --> 29:03.896
Same as every year.

29:04.724 --> 29:05.793
Where's Trevor Miles?

29:05.793 --> 29:06.586
Same thing
every year

29:06.586 --> 29:08.310
back at you.

29:08.310 --> 29:09.275
Don't know.

29:16.310 --> 29:19.241
They don't call them
coffin nails for nothing.

29:22.137 --> 29:23.241
The girl is
dead, Hudson.

29:23.241 --> 29:24.862
We both know that.

29:24.862 --> 29:26.000
I don't know that.

29:26.000 --> 29:28.068
Did you see her with Trevor
the night in question?

29:28.068 --> 29:28.793
No.

29:28.793 --> 29:30.068
For the hundredth time.

29:30.068 --> 29:32.103
Then why was her
shoe in your house?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.655
She used to
play in our yard!

29:33.655 --> 29:35.758
Trevor must
have found it.

29:35.758 --> 29:36.724
Always the same answers.

29:36.724 --> 29:37.965
Always the same questions.

29:37.965 --> 29:39.379
You two were close
friends your entire life.

29:39.379 --> 29:40.310
You're trying
to tell me

29:40.310 --> 29:41.827
he didn't try to get
in contact with you?

29:42.413 --> 29:43.758
People change.

29:46.586 --> 29:47.448
I don't believe you.

29:51.413 --> 29:54.413
Do you want to know
what I think happened?

29:56.551 --> 29:58.103
Trevor took that girl.

29:58.103 --> 29:58.931
Did something-

29:58.931 --> 30:01.103
unimaginable and-

30:03.275 --> 30:04.103
killed himself.

30:04.206 --> 30:05.482
Are you just
saying that?

30:05.482 --> 30:06.896
Or do you know
that for a fact?

30:08.310 --> 30:09.241
Stands to reason!

30:10.793 --> 30:12.551
You know what
also stands-

30:12.551 --> 30:13.482
to reason?

30:14.482 --> 30:15.620
You're dying.

30:18.241 --> 30:20.379
I'm giving you one more
chance to make this right.

30:23.896 --> 30:26.413
Take it from
me, Hudson.

30:26.413 --> 30:29.068
Don't waste your life
chasing ghosts!

30:41.000 --> 30:42.172
Mining is
one of Canada's-

30:42.172 --> 30:43.724
oldest industries.

30:43.827 --> 30:45.000
But here at Basal-

30:45.000 --> 30:47.896
we've brought it
into the 21st century-

30:47.896 --> 30:50.172
with zero waste
by-product runoff

30:50.172 --> 30:52.344
advanced water
and table filtration-

30:52.344 --> 30:53.965
and peace of mind.

30:53.965 --> 30:55.275
For our community-

30:55.275 --> 30:56.793
and generations to come.

31:04.827 --> 31:06.034
We
needed the money.

31:06.034 --> 31:09.827
And those people
were obviously loaded.

31:11.034 --> 31:12.310
Nick was just
going to run in

31:12.310 --> 31:13.862
and grab some things
that we could sell.

31:13.862 --> 31:15.344
He didn't
have a job?

31:15.344 --> 31:16.034
No.

31:16.034 --> 31:17.448
Not right now but-

31:17.448 --> 31:18.931
Okay so-

31:18.931 --> 31:19.620
I work.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.068
Nick went into
the house.

31:21.068 --> 31:22.000
And then-?

31:22.000 --> 31:23.344
I waited
in the car.

31:24.724 --> 31:25.724
We thought the
place was empty.

31:25.724 --> 31:27.034
But there was a
woman in there.

31:27.034 --> 31:28.758
And then she attacked
him with a pair of scissors.

31:28.758 --> 31:31.310
And he was only trying
to protect himself.

31:31.413 --> 31:32.517
He pushed her.

31:32.517 --> 31:34.068
He just tried to
get her off of him.

31:34.068 --> 31:37.172
And then she fell
and hit her head.

31:41.413 --> 31:42.862
Crystal is she dead?

31:44.482 --> 31:46.241
Yeah but it
was an accident!

31:46.241 --> 31:47.448
Okay look.

31:47.448 --> 31:48.724
Here's the thing.

31:48.724 --> 31:50.931
It doesn't matter if
it was an accident.

31:50.931 --> 31:52.689
You drove him there
with the intent to steal.

31:52.689 --> 31:54.413
Whether he meant
to kill her or not-

31:54.413 --> 31:55.448
whatever happened-

31:57.379 --> 31:59.000
Crystal you're an accessory.

32:02.379 --> 32:03.068
Ughh!

33:52.034 --> 33:53.034
Crystal!

33:57.379 --> 33:58.758
Where are you going?

34:00.586 --> 34:01.896
Please let
me have this space.

34:01.896 --> 34:03.689
I've got to get
out of here, Jesse.

34:04.931 --> 34:06.965
I don't want to
wind up in jail.

34:06.965 --> 34:08.551
Even if you could
make it out of here-

34:08.551 --> 34:10.103
you'd be running for
the rest of your life.

34:10.103 --> 34:10.758
Okay?

34:10.758 --> 34:12.206
I would never
see you.

34:12.206 --> 34:13.586
You'd be better off.

34:13.586 --> 34:14.896
No, no I wouldn't.

34:14.896 --> 34:16.103
Yes you would!

34:16.103 --> 34:18.068
You wouldn't even
see me anyway!

34:18.068 --> 34:19.551
You've made it
very very clear

34:19.551 --> 34:21.586
what's about to happen
to me if I turn myself in!

34:21.586 --> 34:22.413
I'm terrified.

34:22.413 --> 34:23.793
I'm very scared!

34:32.034 --> 34:33.655
What's going
on with Sarah?

34:35.310 --> 34:35.965
Sarah?

34:35.965 --> 34:37.241
You okay?

34:37.586 --> 34:38.344
Uh-

34:40.068 --> 34:40.793
No.

34:41.965 --> 34:44.413
I think the seatbelt-

34:44.413 --> 34:47.551
caused some internal
trauma when we crashed.

34:49.931 --> 34:51.172
What does that mean?

34:53.379 --> 34:56.068
I might have
internal bleeding.

34:56.068 --> 34:58.206
Which means-

34:59.551 --> 35:01.275
that you'll need
to operate-

35:01.275 --> 35:02.896
before it gets worse.

35:05.206 --> 35:07.137
Sarah, I can't
do that!

35:09.103 --> 35:10.241
You'll need to operate.

35:10.241 --> 35:11.103
No no no, I can't.

35:11.103 --> 35:11.827
I can barely see!

35:11.827 --> 35:12.482
Jesse.

35:12.482 --> 35:13.241
I can barely see!

35:13.241 --> 35:14.655
And you know how
I am with blood!

35:14.655 --> 35:16.275
You're
going to have to.

35:16.275 --> 35:17.620
I'm sorry.

35:18.344 --> 35:19.724
Jesse.

35:19.724 --> 35:22.103
I'm going to give
you instructions.

35:22.103 --> 35:23.448
You'll just need to
remember them all.

35:23.448 --> 35:24.448
Because-

35:25.034 --> 35:26.137
there's a good chance

35:26.137 --> 35:28.620
I'm going to lose consciousness
during the procedure.

35:30.137 --> 35:31.655
No I-

35:33.034 --> 35:33.758
Are you kidding me?

35:33.758 --> 35:34.758
I can't do that.

35:34.758 --> 35:35.758
And look, it's you!

35:35.758 --> 35:36.620
It's you!

35:36.620 --> 35:37.827
Listen
to me Jesse.

35:37.827 --> 35:39.137
I need you
to do this.

35:39.137 --> 35:41.137
You can do anything
you put your mind to.

35:41.137 --> 35:41.793
Jesse Mills!

35:41.793 --> 35:43.206
You just
flew a plane!

35:47.482 --> 35:49.000
Okay.

36:08.413 --> 36:09.413
Come on in.

36:11.793 --> 36:13.103
Sidney, this is
Wayne Kinney.

36:13.103 --> 36:14.275
His company-

36:14.275 --> 36:16.206
runs the waste
disposal for the mine.

36:16.206 --> 36:17.000
Yeah.

36:17.103 --> 36:17.758
I think we've met.

36:17.758 --> 36:19.379
Yeah a few
times actually.

36:19.379 --> 36:21.862
I work pretty
closely with Daniel.

36:22.793 --> 36:23.862
Can I get
you a coffee?

36:23.862 --> 36:24.793
No thank you.

36:24.793 --> 36:26.275
I just came to ask
you a few questions.

36:26.275 --> 36:27.862
Do you think
you're up for it?

36:28.827 --> 36:29.896
Uh-

36:31.482 --> 36:32.137
Yeah.

36:34.758 --> 36:35.931
How can I help?

36:36.379 --> 36:39.241
Well we've got an ID
on one of the suspects.

36:40.275 --> 36:41.379
Possibly on the second.

36:42.103 --> 36:43.344
That's a good
thing, right?

36:43.344 --> 36:44.724
Absolutely.

36:44.724 --> 36:45.551
Crystal Mills.

36:45.551 --> 36:46.758
Nick Weller.

36:47.275 --> 36:48.206
Do you know them?

36:48.965 --> 36:49.896
I don't think so.

36:49.896 --> 36:51.068
Should I?

36:51.068 --> 36:52.862
They're not on
the employee list.

36:52.862 --> 36:54.068
But we think
that one of them

36:54.068 --> 36:56.000
worked for a company
called Royal Cleaners.

36:58.034 --> 36:58.862
How about you?

36:58.862 --> 37:00.689
Doesn't ring a bell.

37:00.689 --> 37:01.413
So I see-

37:02.551 --> 37:03.862
you think this has something
to do with your husband?

37:03.862 --> 37:05.137
With Daniel?

37:05.793 --> 37:07.000
Daniel's murder?

37:08.310 --> 37:10.137
Well that's what we're
going to find out.

37:11.655 --> 37:12.344
Hey.

37:12.344 --> 37:13.586
Take care of yourself.

37:13.689 --> 37:14.551
Yeah.

37:14.551 --> 37:15.620
Thanks.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.275
Okay some hand sanitizer would
be really great right now.

40:02.275 --> 40:03.344
Is there anything
in that backpack

40:03.344 --> 40:04.896
that might be able
to help us with this?

40:04.896 --> 40:05.724
No no.

40:05.724 --> 40:06.827
That's just Nick's
dirty laundry.

40:06.827 --> 40:08.068
I'm going to
go have a look.

40:09.241 --> 40:10.551
Okay okay.

40:10.551 --> 40:11.827
What do you
need me to do?

40:11.827 --> 40:12.724
Hey hey.

40:12.724 --> 40:13.689
Crystal, are you going
to be listening-

40:13.689 --> 40:14.931
in case I need
help with this?

40:14.931 --> 40:16.689
I'm listening!

40:16.689 --> 40:17.620
Okay.

40:20.000 --> 40:21.517
You're going to make
the incision right here.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.137
Four inches-

40:23.137 --> 40:24.000
from the rib.

40:24.000 --> 40:24.931
If I'm right-

40:24.931 --> 40:26.620
you're looking for
bleeding from the liver.

40:28.586 --> 40:30.103
When you- what?

40:30.103 --> 40:32.241
When you find
the bleeding-

40:32.241 --> 40:33.103
you're going to-

40:34.137 --> 40:35.517
what is it?

40:35.517 --> 40:36.275
You're going take that-

40:36.275 --> 40:37.344
you're going to
take the gauze.

40:37.344 --> 40:38.034
Gauze.

40:38.034 --> 40:40.517
Gently but firmly-

40:40.517 --> 40:42.586
the bleed-

40:45.000 --> 40:47.413
You're going to
take the gauze-

40:50.275 --> 40:55.068
You're going to surround
the organ with material-

40:55.068 --> 40:57.310
so the wound
stays closed.

40:57.413 --> 40:59.517
Okay I think
I can do that.

41:02.931 --> 41:03.931
And then you
compress it-

41:03.931 --> 41:06.413
until the bleeding
stops okay?

41:06.413 --> 41:07.586
Yeah!

41:07.586 --> 41:08.862
All right?

41:13.862 --> 41:14.758
Hold on, okay.

41:16.344 --> 41:17.000
Okay.

41:17.000 --> 41:17.724
Okay no, hold on.

41:20.758 --> 41:21.448
Okay.

41:21.931 --> 41:23.068
Okay.

41:25.000 --> 41:25.689
Okay.

41:25.689 --> 41:26.827
Okay okay.

41:33.275 --> 41:35.034
Okay I'm sorry

41:35.344 --> 41:36.034
I'm sorry!

41:39.241 --> 41:39.965
Okay okay!

41:39.965 --> 41:41.482
There we go!

41:41.482 --> 41:42.620
Okay we
need the gauze.

41:42.620 --> 41:43.620
Here you go.

41:43.724 --> 41:45.103
There'll be some blood.

41:45.103 --> 41:46.344
Don't be alarmed!

41:46.344 --> 41:47.551
Just be quick.

41:47.551 --> 41:49.724
Apply pressure
with the gauze.

41:49.724 --> 41:51.103
Here
here here here!

41:51.103 --> 41:51.758
Okay.

41:51.758 --> 41:52.517
Don't be alarmed!

41:52.517 --> 41:53.655
You've got this.
You've got this.

41:55.413 --> 41:56.758
Just keep it steady.

42:01.862 --> 42:02.931
Just close up
the wound.

42:06.620 --> 42:08.551
You need to
breathe too.

42:18.275 --> 42:19.241
Sarah.

42:19.724 --> 42:20.379
Sarah.

42:21.482 --> 42:22.448
Sarah no
no no no!

42:22.448 --> 42:23.241
Sarah come on!

42:23.241 --> 42:23.896
Come on Sarah!

42:23.896 --> 42:25.413
No, come on!

42:36.551 --> 42:38.000
Hey there boy.

42:38.103 --> 42:39.551
Are you lost?

42:51.206 --> 42:52.034
He's a big boy.

42:52.034 --> 42:53.689
He's going to make
a good guard dog.

42:54.103 --> 42:54.724
Mm-hmm.

42:54.724 --> 42:55.689
Not too bright.

42:55.689 --> 42:57.655
Came with us
without saying boo.

42:57.931 --> 42:58.758
Don't worry.

42:58.758 --> 43:00.275
I know how to
toughen him up.

43:00.379 --> 43:01.965
Do we still have
that chain in the yard?

43:01.965 --> 43:05.344
As if you ever
cleaned it up.
