I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO...

53:11.814 --> 53:14.733
EXPLAIN WHY I DIDN'T GO

53:11.814 --> 53:14.733
AND GET HIM SPECIFIC SOCKS

53:14.775 --> 53:17.987
OR... OR CONTACT THE DENTIST

53:14.775 --> 53:17.987
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT

53:18.029 --> 53:19.613
-AFTER THE HOLIDAYS.

53:18.029 --> 53:19.613
-HMM.

53:21.406 --> 53:23.909
I'M SORRY, I DIDN'T MEAN

53:21.406 --> 53:23.909
TO DUMP ALL OVER YOU.

53:23.951 --> 53:27.163
[LAUGHS] NO, IF YOU WANT

53:23.951 --> 53:27.163
TO SAY SOMETHING, YOU CAN.

53:27.203 --> 53:29.247
I'M A GOOD LISTENER.

53:29.289 --> 53:31.959
I'VE GOT

53:29.289 --> 53:31.959
JUST NO RELATIONSHIP ADVICE,

53:32.001 --> 53:34.712
BECAUSE ALL MY PAST ONES

53:32.001 --> 53:34.712
HAVE FAILED,

53:34.753 --> 53:38.049
BUT I CAN LISTEN.

53:38.090 --> 53:41.593
WELL, YOU AND I HAVE

53:38.090 --> 53:41.593
SOMETHING IN COMMON

53:41.635 --> 53:43.721
BECAUSE THE RELATIONSHIP

53:41.635 --> 53:43.721
THAT I'M IN,

53:43.762 --> 53:49.225
OR I GUESS GETTING OUT OF,

53:43.762 --> 53:49.225
HAS FAILED.

53:50.102 --> 53:51.520
WHAT HAPPENED?

53:53.271 --> 53:55.941
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PIZZA

53:53.271 --> 53:55.941
FOR THAT CONVERSATION.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.527
BUT IF I WERE TO TWEET IT

53:58.569 --> 54:01.697
IN 140 CHARACTERS OR LESS,

54:01.739 --> 54:04.491
THE ROMANCE

54:01.739 --> 54:04.491
WAS REPLACED WITH BUSINESS.

54:07.285 --> 54:10.497
HE STARTED TREATING ME

54:07.285 --> 54:10.497
MORE LIKE A PERSONAL MANAGER

54:10.539 --> 54:12.624
AND LESS LIKE HIS GIRLFRIEND.

54:12.666 --> 54:16.545
AND I LET HIM. I...

54:12.666 --> 54:16.545
I HANDLED EVERYTHING FOR HIM.

54:16.587 --> 54:19.381
HIS SCHEDULING,

54:16.587 --> 54:19.381
HIS PRESS CONTACTS,

54:19.423 --> 54:21.717

54:23.135 --> 54:26.597
YOU KNOW, I LOST MYSELF,

54:26.638 --> 54:33.229
AND I LOST A LOVE THAT...

54:26.638 --> 54:33.229
STARTED OUT SO REAL.

54:33.269 --> 54:34.605
I DON'T KNOW.

54:33.269 --> 54:34.605
MAYBE IF I JUST...

54:34.646 --> 54:36.732
NO, DON'T DO THAT.

54:36.774 --> 54:39.777
THAT QUESTIONING "SHOULD'VE,

54:36.774 --> 54:39.777
WOULD'VE, COULD'VE" THING?

54:39.818 --> 54:43.488
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THERE,

54:39.818 --> 54:43.488
AND YOU JUST GET STUCK

54:39.818 --> 54:43.488
IN A LOOP.

54:45.908 --> 54:49.120
THAT IS SOME PRETTY GOOD ADVICE

54:45.908 --> 54:49.120
FOR A SELF-PROCLAIMED LISTENER.

54:49.161 --> 54:51.413

54:51.455 --> 54:53.582
I BET THE NUTCRACKER ARTIST,

54:53.624 --> 54:55.459
AS LONG AS THAT GUY'S

54:53.624 --> 54:55.459
BEEN MARRIED,

54:55.500 --> 54:59.295
PROBABLY HAS SOME AMAZING

54:55.500 --> 54:59.295
RELATIONSHIP ADVICE.

54:59.337 --> 55:02.174
I BET YOU'RE RIGHT.

55:02.216 --> 55:04.509
-YOU GOING

55:02.216 --> 55:04.509
TO WRITE THE STORY?

55:02.216 --> 55:04.509
-MM-HMM.

-TONIGHT.

55:05.761 --> 55:07.721

[CAR HORN HONKS]

55:11.683 --> 55:13.309

55:13.351 --> 55:15.311

55:13.351 --> 55:15.311

55:15.353 --> 55:18.649

55:15.353 --> 55:18.649
CARLTON IS FUMING.

55:18.690 --> 55:21.401
WELL, THANKS FOR TODAY.

55:21.443 --> 55:23.112
I HAD A LOT OF FUN WITH YOU.

55:23.154 --> 55:25.614

55:23.154 --> 55:25.614
I REALLY ENJOYED IT.

55:25.656 --> 55:27.407
I'LL SEE YOU TOMORROW

55:25.656 --> 55:27.407
THOUGH, RIGHT?

55:27.449 --> 55:30.368
OF COURSE. WE STILL HAVE

55:27.449 --> 55:30.368
THE FUNDRAISER

55:27.449 --> 55:30.368
TO WORK ON, RIGHT?

55:30.410 --> 55:32.788
YES.

55:34.748 --> 55:38.002
AH, CARLTON

55:34.748 --> 55:38.002

55:38.043 --> 55:39.377

-GOODNIGHT.

55:54.268 --> 55:55.519
HOW WAS REHEARSAL?

55:55.560 --> 55:59.273
STRESSFUL. WORRISOME.

55:59.315 --> 56:00.691
WELL, THAT DOESN'T

55:59.315 --> 56:00.691
SOUND GOOD.

56:00.732 --> 56:03.735
IT WASN'T. YOU'RE TO BLAME.

56:03.777 --> 56:05.029
HOW AM I TO BLAME?

56:05.070 --> 56:07.990
I TEXTED YOU, REPEATEDLY.

56:08.032 --> 56:10.284
I HAD A BUSY DAY.

56:10.326 --> 56:12.161
I NEEDED YOU.

56:12.203 --> 56:15.247
TO RUN YOUR ERRANDS.

56:12.203 --> 56:15.247
TO TACKLE YOUR TO-DO LIST.

56:15.289 --> 56:18.250
CARLTON, THOSE CHORES ARE

56:15.289 --> 56:18.250
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, NOT MINE.

56:18.292 --> 56:21.670
I CAN'T CONCENTRATE

56:18.292 --> 56:21.670
ON THE BALLET

56:21.712 --> 56:24.380
WHILE I'M WORRIED

56:21.712 --> 56:24.380
ABOUT YOU AND US.

56:24.422 --> 56:25.883
THIS IS NOT FAIR OF YOU.

56:25.924 --> 56:29.594
I NEED YOU DURING THIS CRUCIAL

56:25.924 --> 56:29.594
TIME IN MY LIFE AND MY CAREER.

56:29.636 --> 56:31.305
PLEASE,

56:29.636 --> 56:31.305
DON'T GUILT-TRIP ME.

56:31.347 --> 56:34.225
YOUR BEHAVIOR RIGHT NOW

56:31.347 --> 56:34.225
IS WHAT'S NOT FAIR.

56:37.686 --> 56:39.271
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, DO YOU?

56:41.315 --> 56:45.027
HOW MUCH IT HURTS TO SEE YOU

56:41.315 --> 56:45.027
GROW AWAY FROM ME

56:41.315 --> 56:45.027
RIGHT IN FRONT OF MY EYES,

56:46.070 --> 56:48.239
MAKING ME REGRET THIS...

56:48.864 --> 56:51.200
STUPID SEPARATION.

56:54.953 --> 56:57.039
I'M GOING OUT.

56:54.953 --> 56:57.039
I NEED SOME AIR.

57:03.503 --> 57:04.838
I LOVE YOU.

57:20.562 --> 57:22.606
SO HE'S A BUTTON-PUSHER.

57:22.647 --> 57:24.983
HE IS.

57:25.025 --> 57:27.611
BUT THE WAY

57:25.025 --> 57:27.611
HE SAID HE LOVED ME...

57:28.695 --> 57:30.281
I DON'T KNOW.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.159
MAYBE HE REALIZED THAT

57:34.201 --> 57:37.495
WHAT WE HAD WHEN WE STARTED OUT

57:34.201 --> 57:37.495
WAS PRETTY SPECIAL,

57:37.537 --> 57:41.541
AND WE LOST IT

57:37.537 --> 57:41.541
WHEN HE PRIORITIZED HIMSELF.

57:41.583 --> 57:44.002
SO ARE YOU HAVING SECOND

57:41.583 --> 57:44.002
THOUGHTS ABOUT THE SPLIT?

57:45.337 --> 57:47.714
IT'S KINDA HARD NOT TO

57:45.337 --> 57:47.714
IN THIS SITUATION.

57:48.673 --> 57:53.178
HMM. WHAT ABOUT DUSTIN?

57:53.220 --> 57:54.930
WHAT ABOUT HIM?

57:54.972 --> 57:57.808
I SAW SOME SPARKS.

57:57.849 --> 58:00.477
I THINK WE'VE ARRIVED

57:57.849 --> 58:00.477
AT A GOOD PLACE.

58:00.518 --> 58:02.771
THE FRIEND PLACE.

58:02.813 --> 58:06.400
WELL, UH, HE IS A GOOD FRIEND

58:02.813 --> 58:06.400
TO HAVE.

58:06.442 --> 58:08.693
HE'S LOYAL, HE'S FAITHFUL,

58:08.735 --> 58:11.655
HE'S FUN, HE IS HONEST,

58:11.696 --> 58:15.284
HE DOESN'T MANIPULATE

58:11.696 --> 58:15.284
AND PLAY GAMES, YOU KNOW?

58:15.326 --> 58:18.912
AND HE ENCOURAGES

58:15.326 --> 58:18.912
AND HE CARES.

58:18.954 --> 58:23.459
HE'S GOT A LOT MORE TO OFFER

58:18.954 --> 58:23.459
THAN JUST BEING THE STEADFAST

58:18.954 --> 58:23.459
FRIEND, YOU KNOW?

58:23.500 --> 58:26.837
BUT I'M SURE YOU FIGURED

58:23.500 --> 58:26.837
THAT OUT DURING YOUR LITTLE

58:23.500 --> 58:26.837
ELEVATOR KISS.

58:26.878 --> 58:29.506
OKAY.

58:29.547 --> 58:32.092
LOOK, MAGIC AND ROMANCE

58:29.547 --> 58:32.092
IGNITE A RELATIONSHIP,

58:32.134 --> 58:35.012
BUT IT'S THE FRIENDSHIP

58:32.134 --> 58:35.012
THAT MAKES IT ENDURE.

58:35.053 --> 58:36.805
YOU KNOW,

58:35.053 --> 58:36.805
IT'S THE FRIENDSHIP

58:36.847 --> 58:38.682
THAT TURNS

58:36.847 --> 58:38.682
THAT HAPPILY EVER AFTER

58:38.723 --> 58:41.977
INTO THE BEGINNING OF A LOVE

58:38.723 --> 58:41.977
STORY, AND NOT THE ENDING.

58:42.019 --> 58:45.772
THE BEGINNING

58:42.019 --> 58:45.772
IS THE EXCITING PART.

58:45.814 --> 58:48.484
BUT IT'S THE REST OF THE STORY

58:45.814 --> 58:48.484
THAT'S THE TRUE PART.

58:59.161 --> 59:00.704
ARE YOU ACTUALLY

58:59.161 --> 59:00.704
GOING TO MARRY HER?

59:00.745 --> 59:04.500
NO. WE CALLED OFF

59:00.745 --> 59:04.500
THE ENGAGEMENT.

59:04.541 --> 59:06.668
[GIRL] THANK GOD. I THOUGHT

59:04.541 --> 59:06.668
YOU WERE LOSING YOUR MIND.

59:06.710 --> 59:10.422
SHE'S A VERY SPECIAL GIRL,

59:06.710 --> 59:10.422
ISN'T SHE?

59:11.965 --> 59:13.633
PUPPIES ARE SPECIAL.

59:13.675 --> 59:15.844
IS THAT WHAT

59:13.675 --> 59:15.844
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR?

59:30.401 --> 59:32.777

59:30.401 --> 59:32.777
TO HURT HER FEELINGS.

59:40.744 --> 59:41.703
YOU ALRIGHT?

59:42.787 --> 59:45.499
N... YEAH. UH...

59:45.541 --> 59:47.251
I JUST THOUGHT THAT

59:45.541 --> 59:47.251
I SAW SOMEONE THAT I KNEW.

59:47.292 --> 59:49.044
OH.

59:49.086 --> 59:50.712
ANYWAY.

59:50.754 --> 59:54.132
A FRIENDSHIP,

59:50.754 --> 59:54.132
THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT FIRST.

01:00:00.305 --> 01:00:02.766
RIESLING AND MERLOT.

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:04.435

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:17.739
AND I SENT EMAILS

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:17.739
TO A FEW OF MY PRESS CONTACTS

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.576
LETTING THEM KNOW THAT

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:20.576
YOU ARE CATERING THE PARTY.

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:25.080
OH MY GOSH. KAYLA,

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:25.080
THAT IS SO SWEET! THANK YOU.

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.582
WHEN DID YOU

01:00:25.122 --> 01:00:26.582
DO ALL OF THIS?

01:00:26.623 --> 01:00:28.041
LAST NIGHT.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.419
I PICKED UP THE POST CARDS

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:30.419
ON MY WAY HERE THIS MORNING.

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:33.213
WHAT ABOUT

01:00:30.461 --> 01:00:33.213
THE NUTCRACKER ARTIST?

01:00:33.255 --> 01:00:34.423
DIDN'T YOU WORK ON THE STORY?

01:00:34.465 --> 01:00:36.925
MM, NO, NOT YET.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:40.262
WHAT DO WE OWE YOU FOR THE POST

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.055
NOTHING.

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.974
I DID THIS AS A THANK YOU

01:00:42.097 --> 01:00:43.974
FOR ALL YOU'VE GIVEN ME.

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.726
BUT YOUR TIME IS VALUABLE,

01:00:44.015 --> 01:00:46.726

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:49.020
NO, I DON'T

01:00:46.768 --> 01:00:49.020
WANT YOUR MONEY.

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.398
AND I DON'T WANT YOU

01:00:49.062 --> 01:00:51.398
DOING FREE WORK.

01:00:54.109 --> 01:00:55.235
DUSTIN.

I'M SORRY

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.283
IF I CROSSED A BOUNDARY.

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.787
NO, IT'S NOT

01:01:03.535 --> 01:01:05.787
THAT YOU CROSSED A BOUNDARY.

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.831
IT'S THAT YOU SHOULD

01:01:05.829 --> 01:01:07.831
HAVE SET A BOUNDARY.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:13.920
OKAY. SORRY.

01:01:10.208 --> 01:01:13.920
I'M GOING TO GO.

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.840
NO, WAIT, KAYLA!

01:01:13.962 --> 01:01:16.840
WAIT. KAYLA!

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.636
DUSTIN, WHY WERE YOU

01:01:18.133 --> 01:01:20.636
JUST A JERK TO HER?

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.847
-I WASN'T A JERK.

01:01:20.677 --> 01:01:23.847
-YES YOU WERE. GO APOLOGIZE.

01:01:23.888 --> 01:01:27.267
I... DON'T THINK I SHOULD.

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.479

01:01:27.309 --> 01:01:30.479
AND EFFORT MAKING THESE FOR US.

01:01:30.521 --> 01:01:31.605
FOR YOU.

01:01:31.647 --> 01:01:33.357
EXACTLY.

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:35.484
AND THAT'S TIME SHE SHOULD
