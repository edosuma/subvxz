<i>[Sharelle] Hello, Alexis.</i>

00:17.392 --> 00:20.603
<i>Hello! How are you, Mrs. Glowing?</i>

00:20.687 --> 00:23.398
<i>[Sharelle] I know. I know.</i>
<i>It was hard for me to get into clothes.</i>

00:23.481 --> 00:24.315
<i>[Alexis] Really?</i>

00:24.399 --> 00:26.943
<i>-I think it's a mind thing, though.</i>
<i>-Yeah, for sure.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:30.405
<i>[Sharelle] So this area</i>
<i>is called Central Avenue.</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:33.950
<i>Also back then,</i>
<i>it was known as Harlem of the South.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:36.286
<i>There were over a hundred businesses here.</i>

00:36.369 --> 00:41.499
<i>And these people worked hard</i>
<i>to get and build everything that they had.</i>

00:41.583 --> 00:45.587
<i>It's things like this…</i>
<i>is the reason why Allure is here today.</i>

<i>Perry Harvey Park</i>

00:49.799 --> 00:54.095
<i>Our ancestors worked hard</i>
<i>for what they got, and built something.</i>

00:55.221 --> 00:57.807
<i>It's always a place I visit</i>
<i>when I need motivation.</i>

00:58.558 --> 01:03.855
<i>I've been going at you and Karla, and</i>
<i>it's like I gave you chance after chance.</i>

01:05.190 --> 01:09.277
<i>When you had your showing</i>
<i>for Tennille, that was…</i>

01:09.986 --> 01:11.446
<i>-I know.</i>
<i>-It was a hot mess.</i>

01:11.529 --> 01:12.530
<i>Yeah, I agree.</i>

01:12.614 --> 01:14.699
<i>The ladies talk to you, give you advice.</i>

01:14.783 --> 01:17.202
<i>It's always excuse after excuse</i>
<i>after excuse.</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:19.454
<i>-And I can't take it no more.</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

01:19.996 --> 01:22.999
<i>And if you're not putting your all,</i>
<i>you can't be part of Allure.</i>

01:23.083 --> 01:26.628
<i>Right now I do have a lot going on,</i>
<i>but, Sharelle, these are not excuses.</i>

01:26.711 --> 01:30.048
<i>Please don't think that I'm making</i>
<i>an excuse for my performance with Ben.</i>

01:30.131 --> 01:31.466
<i>I realize that was shitty.</i>

01:31.549 --> 01:34.052
<i>It took me time to even</i>
<i>come forward and say anything,</i>

01:34.135 --> 01:36.805
<i>but I finally got</i>
<i>the courage to mention it.</i>

01:36.888 --> 01:39.224
<i>I literally mention it</i>
<i>and everybody's throwing it in my face</i>

01:39.307 --> 01:41.184
<i>that I'm making excuses here and there.</i>

01:41.267 --> 01:42.894
<i>But they were excuses, Alexis.</i>

01:42.977 --> 01:44.437
<i>That's hurtful to me.</i>

01:45.438 --> 01:49.734
<i>I don't think real estate</i>
<i>is your number-one priority right now.</i>

01:49.818 --> 01:51.319
<i>It frustrates me.</i>

01:51.820 --> 01:55.323
<i>It's hurtful to think that you don't</i>
<i>feel like I'm putting my all into this,</i>

01:55.406 --> 01:58.159
<i>because I've busted my ass…</i>

01:58.701 --> 02:00.995
<i>[crying] …like, the past month.</i>

02:01.079 --> 02:03.540
<i>I want to say I have really been trying,</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:06.960
<i>and I'm not making excuses, Sharelle.</i>

02:07.544 --> 02:11.381
<i>And it's so easy to assume something</i>
<i>when you don't know about a person.</i>

02:11.464 --> 02:12.757
<i>It's easy to flaunt this,</i>

02:12.841 --> 02:16.261
<i>"Oh, she's just a housewife.</i>
<i>She don't wanna be a real estate agent."</i>

02:16.344 --> 02:19.264

<i>Second is me, the office manager,</i>

<i>and I don't think</i>
<i>some ladies understand that.</i>

04:18.591 --> 04:20.551
<i>I see you making some facial expressions.</i>

04:20.635 --> 04:22.387

04:22.470 --> 04:25.139
<i>I think Colony respects my role,</i>

<i>but I think she may feel a little slighted</i>
<i>because she was here before me.</i>

04:29.310 --> 04:33.064
<i>And I think she may have thought</i>
<i>she was Sharelle's second-in-command,</i>

04:33.147 --> 04:35.692
<i>or her right-hand woman, if you will,</i>

04:35.775 --> 04:38.361

04:41.281 --> 04:42.240
<i>What, Tennille?</i>

04:42.323 --> 04:43.241
<i>I just said… Mmm.</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:50.707
<i>That's not even your office.</i>

04:50.790 --> 04:53.334
<i>This is why I call her "Messy Juawana,"</i>

<i>What I think is best</i>
<i>for Sharelle right now</i>

05:11.269 --> 05:12.103
<i>[Karla] Yes.</i>

05:12.186 --> 05:13.229
<i>Yes, we should!</i>

<i>-Yes, we should.</i>
<i>-Definitely.</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:17.900

<i>you know, we're here for her.</i>

05:23.740 --> 05:27.452
<i>So, Juawana, with the baby,</i>
<i>with Chad being in Miami,</i>

05:27.535 --> 05:30.747
<i>how often are we expecting</i>
<i>Sharelle to be here?</i>

05:30.830 --> 05:34.500
<i>We haven't had those discussions. But,</i>
<i>you know, when you start something new,</i>

<i>to that space for a little while,</i>

<i>but she feels like</i>
<i>she's going to be able to balance it.</i>

05:42.550 --> 05:44.260
<i>[Anne] My concern is access.</i>

05:44.344 --> 05:46.637
<i>How much access do I have to her now?</i>

<i>When you get into business,</i>
<i>the hope is to grow,</i>

10:03.686 --> 10:07.398
<i>Are you gonna be considering</i>
<i>putting anybody in that position</i>

10:07.481 --> 10:09.275
<i>to handle more of the office duties?</i>

10:09.358 --> 10:13.446
<i>If so, this is me showing you that,</i>
<i>"Hey, you know…</i>

10:14.280 --> 10:16.532
<i>whatever you need, I'm here."</i>

10:16.616 --> 10:21.954
<i>Do you feel like you can take on that role</i>
<i>as being a producing successful agent</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:23.998
<i>and still hold it down in the office?</i>

10:24.081 --> 10:27.043
<i>Absolutely, Sharelle. I mean,</i>
<i>I'm already doing that right now.</i>

10:27.126 --> 10:30.212
<i>Like, I'm already producing</i>
<i>and I'm already handling</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:33.090
<i>the other duties that</i>
<i>I have around the office too.</i>

10:33.174 --> 10:34.800
<i>You know, Sharelle, I'm your day one.</i>

10:34.884 --> 10:37.386
<i>You know,</i>
<i>I was here when you started the company.</i>

10:37.470 --> 10:38.304
<i>[Sharelle] Yeah.</i>

10:38.387 --> 10:40.765
<i>I closed the first transaction</i>
<i>under a lawyer.</i>

10:40.848 --> 10:41.682
<i>You did!</i>

10:41.766 --> 10:46.062
<i>You saw me and you believed in me,</i>
<i>and I believe in Allure just as much.</i>

10:46.145 --> 10:51.567
<i>I feel like it kind of just makes sense</i>
<i>for me to fit in that role.</i>

10:52.151 --> 10:56.238
<i>I know that because</i>
<i>you and Juawana are so tight,</i>

10:56.322 --> 10:59.408
<i>that you might consider her before me.</i>

10:59.492 --> 11:01.952
<i>So I definitely wanted</i>
<i>to put that out there that</i>

11:02.036 --> 11:04.038
<i>you can also count on me as well.</i>

11:04.121 --> 11:06.290
<i>I feel like I get along</i>
<i>with all of the ladies.</i>

11:06.374 --> 11:11.796
<i>I feel Juawana doesn't have that rapport</i>
<i>or relationship with all the other agents,</i>

11:11.879 --> 11:16.842
<i>and it could be more of a conflict if</i>
<i>you were to put her in a role like that.</i>

11:18.344 --> 11:19.887
<i>You are a great worker, Colony.</i>

11:19.970 --> 11:22.139
<i>You're a great agent. You hold it down.</i>

11:22.223 --> 11:23.265
<i>You're my day one.</i>

11:23.349 --> 11:26.143
<i>You're doing a lot of things</i>
<i>without me asking you to do it,</i>

11:26.227 --> 11:27.770
<i>and I'm very appreciative of that.</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:31.482

<i>the bigger picture of everything.</i>

<i>So as you can see,</i>

<i>We noticed.</i>

<i>[Sharelle] Yes.</i>

<i>I'm at a point where I cannot</i>

<i>I have to execute,</i>
<i>and it's all business moves from now on.</i>

<i>Wow. Serious.</i>

<i>[Sharelle] Very. If she decides,</i>
<i>maybe seven, eight months down the road,</i>

15:57.581 --> 15:59.959
<i>that, you know,</i>
<i>she want to take real estate serious,</i>

16:00.042 --> 16:02.044
<i>maybe I'll reconsider</i>
<i>bringing her back in.</i>

16:02.127 --> 16:05.089
<i>[Tennille] Sharelle should have</i>
<i>let Alexis go sooner.</i>

16:05.172 --> 16:07.675
<i>I mean, she hasn't been</i>
<i>performing for over a year.</i>

16:07.758 --> 16:12.304
<i>And Sharelle leaving the door open</i>
<i>for Alexis is that soft side of her.</i>

16:12.388 --> 16:14.264
<i>Like she fired her but didn't fire her.</i>

16:14.348 --> 16:16.934
<i>She left the door open</i>
<i>so she could sleep at night.</i>

16:17.017 --> 16:18.686
<i>But, really, I don't think it's open.</i>

16:18.769 --> 16:21.313
<i>If it's open,</i>
<i>it's like a crack just to feel a breeze.</i>

16:21.397 --> 16:23.649
<i>[Karla] Actually, after it happened,</i>
<i>she did call me.</i>

16:23.732 --> 16:26.151
<i>So we went and met up,</i>
<i>and I talked to her.</i>

16:26.235 --> 16:29.863
<i>She was very emotional. Very emotional.</i>

16:29.947 --> 16:31.532
<i>-She's not feeling good right now.</i>
<i>-Wow.</i>

16:31.615 --> 16:34.618
<i>Was she surprised or did she seem</i>
<i>like she was expecting it?</i>

16:34.702 --> 16:37.287
<i>I mean, she understood</i>
<i>where I was coming from,</i>

16:37.371 --> 16:40.040
<i>and she knew it wasn't</i>
<i>nothing, you know, personal.</i>

16:40.124 --> 16:42.292
<i>This was the best decision.</i>

16:42.376 --> 16:46.380
<i>Um, I have a lot of things going on</i>
<i>with me building on Allure,</i>

16:46.463 --> 16:49.967
<i>and carrying this baby</i>
<i>for seven and a half more months.</i>

16:50.050 --> 16:51.927
<i>I can't be a one-man team.</i>

<i>In order for a successful business</i>
<i>to grow and operate,</i>

16:55.723 --> 16:57.391
<i>you have to bring on people. So…</i>

16:58.559 --> 17:01.270
<i>I have decided that I am going to put</i>

17:01.353 --> 17:03.313
<i>Juawana in a higher role.</i>

17:03.397 --> 17:06.483
<i>She's going to take on</i>
<i>more responsibilities here at Allure.</i>

17:06.567 --> 17:09.069
<i>[tense music playing]</i>

17:10.863 --> 17:13.240
<i>[Sharelle] So basically</i>
<i>whatever Juawana says,</i>

17:13.824 --> 17:14.908
<i>it's coming from me.</i>

17:14.992 --> 17:19.204

<i>[tense music continues]</i>

17:23.792 --> 17:27.087
<i>Is this, like, now, immediately,</i>
<i>or when you</i>

17:27.171 --> 17:29.256
<i>start feeling like you can't handle it?</i>

17:29.339 --> 17:32.092
<i>What you saying? I can't handle this</i>
<i>because I'm putting other people--</i>

17:32.176 --> 17:34.887
<i>No. I don't know why you…</i>
<i>Why did you say you put her in the role?</i>

17:34.970 --> 17:36.513
<i>I said because I'm building Allure.</i>

17:39.141 --> 17:41.185
<i>[Rena] Are you still</i>
<i>gonna be in the Tampa office?</i>

17:41.268 --> 17:42.811
<i>Yeah, I'mma be back and forth.</i>

17:42.895 --> 17:44.646
<i>-Between Miami and here?</i>
<i>-Mmm-hmm.</i>

17:45.230 --> 17:48.817
<i>So is she managing the office</i>
<i>or just your assistant?</i>

17:48.901 --> 17:50.527
<i>No, I'm the managing broker,</i>

17:50.611 --> 17:53.447
<i>but she will be relaying messages,</i>
<i>doing roles,</i>

17:53.530 --> 17:55.532
<i>doing everything that needs to be done.</i>

17:55.616 --> 17:57.826
<i>In a bigger capacity</i>
<i>than what she's been doing?</i>

17:57.910 --> 17:58.744
<i>Yes.</i>

17:58.827 --> 18:00.871
<i>That doesn't mean that</i>
<i>I'm the broker in charge,</i>

18:00.954 --> 18:03.665
<i>'cause I technically</i>
<i>don't have my broker's license.</i>

18:04.750 --> 18:08.337
<i>I have no interest</i>
<i>in managing this office.</i>

18:08.420 --> 18:11.590
<i>I mean, one, I'm already upset</i>
<i>about the commission split.</i>

18:11.673 --> 18:16.095
<i>So I'm not trying to take on more</i>
<i>responsibilities I'm not getting paid for.</i>

18:16.178 --> 18:18.263
<i>But I understand it needs to be filled.</i>

18:18.347 --> 18:20.557
<i>And I think it's important</i>
<i>that the right person fill it.</i>

18:20.641 --> 18:25.187
<i>Juawana, I don't know that her management</i>
<i>style is the best for what we need.</i>

<i>You said that you're expanding,</i>
<i>that you wanna bring in a team,</i>

18:36.281 --> 18:38.659
<i>so you put Juawana in it, um…</i>

18:38.742 --> 18:42.162
<i>but why just Juawana</i>
<i>in a certain position?</i>

18:42.246 --> 18:45.457
<i>[Sharelle] She knows all the systems</i>
<i>and deals that we are doing.</i>

18:45.541 --> 18:48.961
<i>She's in a lot of the office calls</i>
<i>when I'm scheduling meetings with people.</i>

18:49.044 --> 18:51.004
<i>She take initiative to do those things.</i>

18:51.088 --> 18:54.842
<i>A lot of the deals that we have,</i>
<i>you wasn't in on those calls,</i>

18:54.925 --> 18:57.386
<i>so it doesn't make sense to bring you in.</i>

18:58.137 --> 19:01.974
<i>[Colony] I wasn't, um…</i>
<i>put in on those calls.</i>

19:02.057 --> 19:04.184
<i>[Sharelle] Right.</i>
<i>Because a lot of those calls,</i>

19:04.268 --> 19:06.562
<i>Juawana actually took initiative,</i>

19:06.645 --> 19:08.605
<i>and she set those calls up.</i>

19:08.689 --> 19:09.523

<i>I'm very grateful for this,</i>
<i>but why so early?</i>

21:06.682 --> 21:09.685
<i>You might leave and go to Miami.</i>
<i>We never know where you are.</i>

21:09.768 --> 21:11.687
<i>We was like,</i>
<i>"Let's catch her before she leaves."</i>

<i>-[Juawana] Yes!</i>
<i>-[Anne] Yes! Absolutely!</i>

21:13.855 --> 21:15.649
<i>But, wait, where's Alexis?</i>

<i>I spoke with Alexis earlier.</i>

<i>She's just gonna take time for herself,</i>

21:34.293 --> 21:36.920
<i>[Sharelle] Can I get an orange juice</i>
<i>with a splash of Sprite?</i>

21:37.004 --> 21:38.588
<i>-Make it look like…</i>
<i>-A little fizz.</i>

21:38.672 --> 21:40.632
<i>[Sharelle] Just a little razzle dazzle.</i>

21:40.716 --> 21:43.844
<i>I did want to talk to you about</i>
<i>what happened at the last meeting.</i>

21:43.927 --> 21:45.554
<i>I saw that you were getting frustrated.</i>

21:45.637 --> 21:47.264
<i>I felt we were gonna be on the same page.</i>

21:47.347 --> 21:51.393
<i>Then when you picked Juawana instead</i>
<i>of me, it was like, "Well, damn." Like…</i>

21:51.476 --> 21:53.562
<i>-At least a heads up would've been nice.</i>
<i>-Right.</i>

21:53.645 --> 21:56.023
<i>And I should've came</i>
<i>and spoke with you about that.</i>

21:56.106 --> 21:59.026
<i>Yeah, I was completely,</i>
<i>like, caught off-guard.</i>

21:59.109 --> 21:59.943
<i>Right.</i>

22:00.027 --> 22:04.573
<i>I want you to know that I'm very grateful</i>
<i>for everything that you do at Allure.</i>

22:04.656 --> 22:07.159
<i>I just want you to give</i>
<i>Juawana the same respect.</i>

22:07.242 --> 22:09.911
<i>I feel like Juawana needs</i>
<i>to give me the same respect.</i>

22:09.995 --> 22:12.914
<i>Like, she makes these little,</i>
<i>slick comments.</i>

22:12.998 --> 22:14.750
<i>And I'm like, "None of that is necessary."</i>

22:14.833 --> 22:18.378
<i>-Maybe she's not realizing she's doing it.</i>
<i>-She knows, Sharelle.</i>

22:19.004 --> 22:21.214
<i>She knows exactly what she's doing.</i>

22:21.298 --> 22:23.050
<i>-You know I'm a team player.</i>
<i>-You are.</i>

22:23.133 --> 22:24.551
<i>So that was a little hurtful.</i>

22:24.634 --> 22:26.887
<i>It is what it is, but we're good.</i>

22:26.970 --> 22:30.599
<i>I'm not thrilled that</i>
<i>Juawana is in this position now.</i>

22:30.682 --> 22:34.478
<i>However, I'm very appreciative</i>
<i>of Sharelle coming to me</i>

22:34.561 --> 22:36.980
<i>and still making me feel valuable.</i>

22:37.064 --> 22:38.357
<i>I'll give her a shot.</i>

22:38.440 --> 22:41.193
<i>But if she fucks it up,</i>
<i>that's on Sharelle.</i>

22:41.276 --> 22:42.527
<i>Give me a hug, girl.</i>

22:42.611 --> 22:46.281
<i>-You know I love you. Still my day one.</i>
<i>-I love you too. I know.</i>

<i>Hey!</i>

22:47.491 --> 22:48.617
<i>What's up?</i>

22:48.700 --> 22:53.663
<i>With, you know,</i>
<i>Sharelle potentially going to Miami,</i>

22:53.747 --> 22:59.086
<i>I don't wanna be unhappy if things don't</i>
<i>go well when Juawana takes charge.</i>

22:59.169 --> 23:01.922
<i>I completely understand that.</i>
<i>I'm with you on that.</i>

23:02.005 --> 23:03.882
<i>I think when you had that conversation</i>

23:03.965 --> 23:06.927
<i>with Colony and I about</i>
<i>always having a backup plan,</i>

23:07.010 --> 23:09.763
<i>that resonated with me,</i>
<i>and I didn't have a backup plan.</i>

23:09.846 --> 23:14.017
<i>So I think the next step for me</i>
<i>is to get my broker's license.</i>

28:01.221 --> 28:02.055
<i>Yup.</i>

28:02.138 --> 28:04.933
<i>"Abandon"? Why don't she take ownership?</i>

28:05.016 --> 28:06.935
<i>-Right.</i>
<i>-No, it doesn't work like that.</i>

28:07.018 --> 28:09.020
<i>You're still making excuses.</i>

28:09.104 --> 28:12.065
<i>Between me and you,</i>
<i>the conversation that I had with her is,</i>

28:12.148 --> 28:16.069
<i>I said, "If you change and you're</i>
<i>ready to be a top-producing agent,</i>

28:16.152 --> 28:18.029
<i>I would welcome you back."</i>

28:19.322 --> 28:21.449
<i>Now you want to fucking blame me.</i>

28:21.533 --> 28:23.660
<i>Alexis wants sympathy</i>
<i>from the other agents,</i>

28:23.743 --> 28:25.161
<i>not taking accountability.</i>

28:25.245 --> 28:27.831
<i>That's her fucking problem.</i>
<i>She don't take accountability.</i>

28:28.540 --> 28:31.251
<i>I'm over it.</i>
<i>If she come, I won't say anything.</i>

28:32.919 --> 28:36.673
<i>I'm just done with it. I'm not gonna</i>
<i>reach out to her about this situation.</i>

28:36.756 --> 28:39.467
<i>-It's whatever.</i>
<i>-Is she even coming today?</i>

28:39.551 --> 28:41.177
<i>-Like, where is she at?</i>
<i>-I dunno.</i>

28:41.261 --> 28:44.389
<i>I dunno. Maybe she feels some</i>
<i>type of way because it's awkward.</i>

28:44.472 --> 28:46.891
<i>-I mean, I would feel awkward too.</i>
<i>-Yeah.</i>

28:46.975 --> 28:48.560
<i>But this is your birthday.</i>

28:48.643 --> 28:50.687
<i>I'm gonna act like</i>
<i>I didn't hear this conversation.</i>

28:50.770 --> 28:52.313
<i>-Let's go back up.</i>
<i>-Let's have fun.</i>

28:52.397 --> 28:54.774
<i>I wanted to tell you that</i>
<i>just so you know…</i>

28:54.858 --> 28:56.776
<i>I know you be holding it down, Colony.</i>

28:56.860 --> 29:00.029
<i>You hold it down for Allure.</i>
<i>You are my girl.</i>

29:00.113 --> 29:02.407

30:41.214 --> 30:44.676

<i>-I do.</i>
<i>-How?</i>

30:46.553 --> 30:48.388
<i>I do, I feel like you gave up</i>

30:48.471 --> 30:50.807
<i>before I could actually,</i>
<i>like, prove myself as a Realtor.</i>

30:50.890 --> 30:52.809
<i>-But you been here for two years, Alexis.</i>
<i>-I know.</i>

30:52.892 --> 30:54.561
<i>And you're placing the blame on me.</i>

<i>"Oh, let me just</i>
<i>broadcast what's going on in my home."</i>

31:13.538 --> 31:14.831
<i>I'm very private.</i>

31:14.914 --> 31:18.585
<i>I don't really come out and just express</i>
<i>what I'm thinking, what I'm feeling.</i>

31:18.668 --> 31:20.712
<i>We all been through stuff.</i>
<i>So me telling you,</i>

31:20.795 --> 31:22.797
<i>"Come to us about stuff," it's no mess.</i>

31:22.881 --> 31:24.465

31:44.652 --> 31:45.653
<i>-Absolutely.</i>
<i>-I get it.</i>

31:45.737 --> 31:47.655
<i>I didn't know,</i>
<i>and you put me in a position</i>

31:47.739 --> 31:51.242
<i>where I had to make a boss move</i>
<i>and just let you go.</i>

31:51.326 --> 31:55.288

32:09.844 --> 32:12.847
<i>[Alexis] I don't know</i>
<i>if I'm going to return to Allure.</i>

32:12.931 --> 32:18.603
<i>Part of me feels like, do I want a broker</i>
<i>that's going to just give up on me?</i>

32:18.686 --> 32:22.732
<i>Or do I come back and walk in like,</i>
<i>"Bitch, I'm back"?</i>

32:22.815 --> 32:26.986
<i>I understand your decision. I don't agree.</i>
<i>I'm a little upset. I'm bothered by it.</i>

32:27.070 --> 32:30.156
<i>But now I'm here.</i>
<i>That's in the past. That's behind me.</i>

32:30.239 --> 32:31.574
<i>From here, I'll do my best</i>

32:31.658 --> 32:35.828
<i>to be more vocal about my feelings</i>
<i>and the things that I want to say.</i>

32:36.412 --> 32:38.456
<i>-Okay.</i>
<i>-Well, I wish you the best.</i>

32:38.539 --> 32:40.583
