00:19.436 --> 00:20.854
What troubles you, Sister?

00:20.937 --> 00:24.774
It's the woman who came from the water.
She's been in our care for two years.

00:24.858 --> 00:27.777
She hasn't spoken a word
and spends her days in a fog.

00:27.861 --> 00:30.030
Have you been steadfast in your prayers?

00:30.113 --> 00:32.991
I have. And yet,
her condition does not improve.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.410
"And yet"? Is prayer but a bargain?

00:35.493 --> 00:38.955
Is it for  you  to present terms
to the Lord?

00:39.039 --> 00:40.498
No, Mother. I just--

00:40.582 --> 00:45.253
You seek a sign from God.
Should He seek  less  from you?

00:45.336 --> 00:46.212

00:46.296 --> 00:49.174
Take the woman to the seaside
tomorrow after Matins.

Prove your faith to Him
that He might reveal His glory to you.

00:54.095 --> 00:55.055
Yes, Mother.

That's water. Water.

This is hopeless! I want to help you,
but I don't even know who you are!

01:11.446 --> 01:14.949
I look at your face and think
you could be literally anyone.

01:15.033 --> 01:17.077
Are you a federal judge? A Russian spy?

01:17.160 --> 01:19.370

02:40.702 --> 02:42.954
Spent two weeks in a hospital
hooked up to a feeding tube.

02:43.037 --> 02:44.873
You drank milkshakes.
That's not a feeding tube.

02:44.956 --> 02:46.541
It's basically a feeding tube.

02:46.875 --> 02:49.544
How many do you take a day?
Are you in that much pain right now?

-Okay.

"Surprising depth"?
God, they always gotta slant it.

03:01.181 --> 03:02.599
Why can't it just be "depth"?

03:02.682 --> 03:04.684
I'd hate to see you after a bad review.

03:04.767 --> 03:07.854
Oh, and I bet "eponymous"
was supposed to be a pun on "pony."

Wait. There's a part about me.

in a review before.

crackles with nuance and power."

03:18.406 --> 03:20.241
Damn, look at me-- in two sentences.

03:20.325 --> 03:23.745
Well, don't let it go to your head.
Probably just because you're a good actor.

03:23.828 --> 03:25.830
Anyway, I got you something
for the premiere party.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.667
-These are beautiful, BoJack.
-Well, don't let it go to your head.

03:29.751 --> 03:31.836
It's because you visited me
in the hospital every day,

03:31.920 --> 03:34.797
and I got used to having you around,
and it turns out I like you.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.841

03:48.394 --> 03:51.147
"Barely scabbed-over."

You're the one
who took a stock bad-boy detective

03:53.483 --> 03:54.901

-Honk, honk!

04:04.827 --> 04:06.496
Well, that'll give you plenty of time

04:06.579 --> 04:09.249
to come up with a few spontaneous remarks
for the red carpet.

-Look, I gotta go. You'll be great.

-Just be charmingly effusive. Be yourself.
-I can't be both of those things at once!

-Abel Ziegler.

you gotta talk to Ziggy.

to go to the dentist.

rediscover the woman I fell in love with
those many years ago?

my too-feeble heart.

without the words to express it?

10:59.575 --> 11:04.914
-Uh... guys, are you sure about this?
-I've never been more sure about anything.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.416
Todd, why don't you show your new boss
around the premises?

11:07.583 --> 11:10.419
I'm actually about to head out
to the  Philbert  premiere party.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.130
-[Henry]  I'm coming.
-Brilliant! You'll take him with you!

11:13.214 --> 11:15.383
Oh, no, no.
He doesn't need to come.

11:15.466 --> 11:18.427
[Henry]  I'm coming, I'm coming.
Oh, God, I'm coming.

11:18.511 --> 11:20.930
Whatever you say... boss.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.264
[splattering]

11:23.307 --> 11:24.183
Hello, everyone.

11:24.392 --> 11:26.644
Thank you for attending the premiere
of my opus.

11:26.727 --> 11:29.480
I hope you all enjoy it
because that means you are smart.

11:29.563 --> 11:32.692
If you don't get it, that means
that my genius wasn't appreciated

11:32.775 --> 11:34.819
in my own time, and that's okay, too.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.153
[weak laughter]

11:36.237 --> 11:39.198
Why are you laughing?
Please do not laugh during the screening.

11:39.281 --> 11:41.409
This episode contains
no intentional humor.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.495
[chuckles] Okay. That's--
that's always a good sign,

11:44.578 --> 11:47.790
when you have to clarify that.
Look, folks, Herb is being modest.

11:47.873 --> 11:48.999
-"Herb"?
-I'm sorry.

11:49.083 --> 11:52.336
[laughs] Flip. Did I say Herb?

11:52.962 --> 11:56.424
Herb is being modest,
but he put together a tremendous show

11:56.507 --> 11:58.384
that I think that you guys
are really gonna love.

11:58.467 --> 12:00.886
That's right.
It all came out of this brain.

12:01.095 --> 12:05.099
-Ha! That brain, he says?
-That brain? Double-ha!

12:05.182 --> 12:06.016
Shh!

12:06.100 --> 12:08.436
And the most amazing thing about this show

12:08.519 --> 12:11.397
is that I'm sure we all have Philberts
in our lives,

12:11.480 --> 12:12.982
or we are Philberts.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.777
You know, we've all done terrible things
that we deeply regret.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.905
I've done so many... unforgivable things.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.283
And I think that,
that's what this show says.

12:22.366 --> 12:26.996
Is that... is that we're all terrible,
so therefore we're all... okay.

12:27.079 --> 12:27.913
What?

12:27.997 --> 12:31.000
And I think
that's a really powerful message.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.253
Okay, well, without further ado,
the first chapter,

12:34.336 --> 12:36.338
and notice I said "chapter" not episode

12:36.422 --> 12:40.092
because I think of this show as more
of a novel than a TV show...

12:40.176 --> 12:42.428
-of  Philbert!
-[applause]

12:45.347 --> 12:47.308
[BoJack's voice]
Nothing's lonelier than a party.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.187
[cheering, applause]

12:52.396 --> 12:53.856
Barf me a river!

12:54.482 --> 12:55.649
[camera shutter clicks]

12:55.775 --> 12:57.777
[phone clicking]

12:59.195 --> 13:01.864
Hey, Pickles, where have you been?
You left after, like, ten minutes.

13:01.947 --> 13:03.157
I'm sorry.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.452
My friend Ilana, not my best friend Ilana,
but another Ilana who is my friend,

13:06.535 --> 13:09.455
was having a crisis,
and I needed to text her "LOL."

13:09.538 --> 13:11.040
Well, you missed the whole episode.

13:11.123 --> 13:14.126
I saw the first ten minutes!
I just couldn't get into it.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.419
And you kept saying,

13:15.503 --> 13:18.088
"Do you love it? Are you loving it?
How did you like that scene?"

13:18.172 --> 13:21.217
Well, did you love it? Were you loving it?
How did you like that scene?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.427
Every time you showed up on screen,
I kept thinking,

13:23.511 --> 13:26.430
"That's not a dirty cop,
that's my boyfriend!

13:26.514 --> 13:29.099
The sweetest, cutest dog
in the whole world!"

13:29.183 --> 13:31.685
And then you'd shoot someone,
and I was like... eww!

13:31.769 --> 13:34.146
-Fritz is the hardest I've ever acted.
-Oh.

13:34.271 --> 13:35.981
Harder than the ice bucket challenge,

13:36.065 --> 13:38.108
but it was fake ice.
I wanted you to see it.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.569
I'm going to fix this.
You stay here and party.

13:40.653 --> 13:43.155
I'll go home.
I'll watch the entire season of your show.

13:43.239 --> 13:44.657
You don't have to do that.

13:44.740 --> 13:49.203
And you don't have to like every one
of my Instagram posts, but you do.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.539
The least I could do
is watch your TV show,

13:51.622 --> 13:55.000
even if it kills me
because I hate it so much.

13:55.084 --> 13:58.629
-Well, don't watch it if you hate it.
-I'm going to do this for us.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.381
-But--
-I love you!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.508
-[sighs]
-[buzzing]

14:03.425 --> 14:06.428
I've been to dozens of these things
and I've never heard applause like that.

14:06.512 --> 14:07.888
We might actually get a season two.

14:07.972 --> 14:10.099
-That's never happened to me before.
-That's incredible.

14:10.182 --> 14:13.185
Excuse me,
can I borrow you for a few minutes?

14:13.269 --> 14:15.604
-Oh, sure. Gina, do you mind if I, um...?
-Yeah, go ahead.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.399
Oh, no, I was actually talking to Gina.

14:18.482 --> 14:20.776
Me? I'm being borrowed for a few minutes?

14:20.860 --> 14:23.320
Oh! Well, yeah. Yeah, of course.
Yeah, yeah. Sure.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.072
Wow. Oh, my God.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.533
Hey, how you doing? Hey, you came!

14:27.616 --> 14:30.327
Flip, I screwed up.
I didn't know it would feel like that.

14:30.411 --> 14:33.789
To be in that room.
To hear people cheering  for Philbert!

14:33.873 --> 14:36.667
-What are you talking about?
-When I first started on this job,

14:36.750 --> 14:38.711
I wanted to make  Philbert
more well-rounded,

14:38.794 --> 14:40.504
so the audience
could relate to him better.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.839
And now you're upset

14:41.922 --> 14:44.508
because I didn't mention you
in my introduction.

14:44.592 --> 14:48.679
Diane, the whole point of television
is it's a collaborative medium,

14:48.762 --> 14:51.932
-where one person gets all the credit.
-No, it's not about that.

14:52.016 --> 14:55.269
I made him more vulnerable,
and that made him more likable,

14:55.352 --> 14:57.062
which makes for a better TV show.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.190
But if  Philbert  is just a way
to help dumb assholes   rationalize

15:00.274 --> 15:01.442
their own awful behavior,

15:01.525 --> 15:04.320
well, I'm sorry,
but we can't put this out there.

15:04.403 --> 15:05.696
Uh, it's out there.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.449
The whole season's dropping at midnight
all over the world.

15:08.532 --> 15:10.576
-I can't be here.
-[Flip sighs]

15:10.868 --> 15:13.412
Come on, fellas.
I know we can find a solution here.

15:13.495 --> 15:14.330
I doubt it.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.916
We have the same problem
as a hematology lab

15:16.999 --> 15:19.209
that goes a week without electricity!

15:19.293 --> 15:20.961
Too much bad blood!

15:21.045 --> 15:24.340
But you obviously work together so well.
What went wrong?

15:24.423 --> 15:26.175
It was a long time ago.

15:26.258 --> 15:29.011
My wife Harriet
always had a sneaker for Ziggy.

15:29.178 --> 15:31.388
Oh, and the unspoken resentment crept in?

15:31.472 --> 15:33.599
Unspoken? It was shouted!

15:33.682 --> 15:36.769
Nevertheless, me and Harriet ended up
having a fling.

15:36.852 --> 15:38.103
Eventually, we got married.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.773
-And that killed the partnership?
-No, we got over that.

15:40.856 --> 15:43.776
But at their tenth anniversary,
I had a few too many--

15:43.859 --> 15:45.402
And what, you took a swing at him?

15:45.486 --> 15:47.988
I said I always felt
he had the easier job,

15:48.072 --> 15:49.531
coming up with the punch lines.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.241
And then what? What led to the rift?

15:51.325 --> 15:55.371
Led? That's the whole rift!
He besmirched my craft.

15:55.454 --> 15:57.373
I still haven't forgiven
the son of a bitch!

15:57.456 --> 16:01.418
I said it then, and I stand by it now!

16:01.502 --> 16:03.921
All the pressure's on the punch line!

16:04.004 --> 16:05.422
Pressure? Please!

16:05.506 --> 16:09.134
Set-ups need context,
mise-en-scène, flavor!

16:09.218 --> 16:12.930
I carried us to the top
of the Popsicle stick game!

16:13.013 --> 16:15.766
You wrote the part
they let you try before you buy!

16:15.849 --> 16:17.559
I had to deliver the money line!

16:17.643 --> 16:18.644
[both] Ugh!

16:18.727 --> 16:21.021
So, you both think you had the harder job?

16:21.105 --> 16:22.314
-[Abel] Of course!
-Indubitably!

16:22.398 --> 16:24.525
Well, what if you tried switching roles?

16:24.650 --> 16:27.695
-You mean, I tag  his  set-ups?
-Why not?

16:27.778 --> 16:30.823
I don't know.
I'm a punch line guy my whole life.

16:30.906 --> 16:33.158
How do I come up with straight lines?

16:33.867 --> 16:36.745
-You could try using a ruler.
-Oh!

16:36.829 --> 16:38.247
[both laugh]

16:38.330 --> 16:41.750
-Oh, I missed you, Abel!
-You, too, Zig!

16:42.042 --> 16:43.752
All right, so we have a deal?

16:43.836 --> 16:47.464
What did the terminally ill man say
to Dr. Kevorkian?

16:47.548 --> 16:49.967
"Give me that sweet release!"

16:53.345 --> 16:54.221
Hey.

16:54.638 --> 16:57.182
Did you really mean what you said,
before the screening?

16:57.266 --> 17:00.686
About how Philbert made you feel okay,
about yourself?

17:00.769 --> 17:01.687
Oh, I don't know--

17:01.770 --> 17:04.023
Because, you know,
that's not the point of Philbert--

17:04.106 --> 17:06.150
for guys to watch it and feel okay.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.652
Diane, it's a compliment.
You did a good job. Relax.

17:08.736 --> 17:10.362
I don't want you, or anyone else,

17:10.446 --> 17:12.823
justifying their shitty behavior
because of the show.

17:12.906 --> 17:13.824
What is your problem?

17:13.907 --> 17:16.118
Why can't you accept
that something you did is successful?

17:16.201 --> 17:18.120
It's connecting to people,
and that's good.

17:18.203 --> 17:20.664
You're right, sorry.
I don't know why I thought you would care.

17:20.748 --> 17:23.459
-Excuse me?
-What is going on with you? You're a mess.

17:23.542 --> 17:26.962
-Am I?
-I feel like I barely know you anymore.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.464
Oh, bullshit. Don't give me that.

17:28.547 --> 17:31.633
-It's true. I don't know you.
-No. You know me. You do.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.510
Then what the hell happened in New Mexico?

17:34.470 --> 17:35.554
Look, I...

17:35.637 --> 17:37.306
I don't know what you think
that you know--

17:37.389 --> 17:38.432
I don't know anything!

17:38.515 --> 17:41.852
I mean, I know something happened
with a girl in New Mexico,

17:41.935 --> 17:44.104
and I know it resulted in
you coming home in a boat.

17:44.188 --> 17:45.439
-Well, that's--
-I also know...

17:45.522 --> 17:47.566
that your old friend Charlotte
lives in New Mexico

17:47.649 --> 17:50.194
because you used to leave
her business card lying around the house,

17:50.277 --> 17:52.780
and I know her daughter is a senior
at Oberlin.

17:52.863 --> 17:54.782
-How--?
-And I know you went to Oberlin

17:54.865 --> 17:56.200
during your bender three years ago

17:56.283 --> 17:58.744
because a bunch of students
posted pictures of you on Facebook.

17:58.827 --> 18:01.288
Jesus Christ,
why are you so obsessed with me?

18:01.371 --> 18:02.915
I am not obsessed.

18:02.998 --> 18:05.209
I wanted to know what happened,
and you wouldn't tell me.

18:05.292 --> 18:07.920
-You never asked!
-Okay, so I'm asking now.

18:08.003 --> 18:10.214
What happened in New Mexico?

18:10.297 --> 18:13.842
-Hallo! Smile for Yahoo, Finland!
-[camera shutter clicks]

18:13.926 --> 18:15.469
What I don't understand is why you feel

18:15.552 --> 18:18.055
like you deserve to know
every shitty thing I ever did.

18:18.138 --> 18:19.473
I don't deserve anything.

18:19.556 --> 18:22.184
I would like to know
when you've done shitty things.

18:22.267 --> 18:23.268
Why is that your business?

18:23.352 --> 18:26.355
Because I'm your friend,
and I care about you,

18:26.438 --> 18:28.607
and I wrote a book about you,

18:28.690 --> 18:32.277
and now I wrote this show for you,
and I am very publicly your friend,

18:32.361 --> 18:35.781
so if it gets out that you're doing
creepy stuff, that makes me look bad.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.367
Oh! So you're worried about things
that I may have done

18:38.450 --> 18:41.328
because you think
that it reflects badly on  you?

18:41.411 --> 18:43.539
Hurts your brand?
That's your moral high ground?

18:43.622 --> 18:45.374
This is not about "moral high ground."

18:45.457 --> 18:46.583
Wanna know about New Mexico?

18:46.667 --> 18:49.461
You want to know about the one
little thing that I did in New Mexico,

18:49.545 --> 18:51.296
which, by the way,
wasn't even really a thing?

18:51.380 --> 18:53.549
-You know what? Spare me.
-No, I'm gonna tell you.

18:53.632 --> 18:54.800
I'll tell you what you want.

18:54.883 --> 18:57.886
And while I'm at it, you wanna hear about
what happened at the MTV beach house?

18:57.970 --> 18:59.680
Or why I'm not allowed
to fly United anymore?

18:59.763 --> 19:02.266
Or what happened with Sharona,
the makeup lady on  Horsing Around?

19:02.349 --> 19:04.601
-What?
-Or the dozens of other shady things

19:04.685 --> 19:07.604
that may or may not have occurred
in my life that I can barely even remember

19:07.688 --> 19:10.065
'cause I was high or drunk
or it was 30 years ago?

19:10.149 --> 19:12.317
And you don't feel bad,
about any of this stuff?

19:12.401 --> 19:15.529
Yeah, of course I do!
I've spent so much time feeling bad.

19:15.612 --> 19:19.074
By the way, most of these women...
don't even remember, I bet.

19:19.158 --> 19:20.951
Well, that's really convenient for you.

19:21.034 --> 19:22.786
I'm the one
who has to live with this shit.

19:22.870 --> 19:25.581
I'm the one who has to feel the guilt
all day, every day.

19:25.664 --> 19:27.416
So, you're the victim here?

19:27.499 --> 19:29.710
Yeah, and I know
that's not the woke, progressive,

19:29.793 --> 19:32.963
intersectionally appropriate thing to say,
but I would say, yeah!

19:33.046 --> 19:36.175
I'm the one who has suffered the most
because of the actions of BoJack Horseman.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.926
-You've  suffered?
-Yeah, I have!

19:38.010 --> 19:39.636
-The most?
-The most!

19:39.720 --> 19:43.098
Really? More than, say, Sarah Lynn?

19:43.807 --> 19:44.975
Don't talk to me about her.

19:45.058 --> 19:49.021
No, I wanna know how  you're  the victim
of the Sarah Lynn story.

19:49.104 --> 19:50.439
-I'm serious.
-Explain to me...

19:50.522 --> 19:53.775
how Sarah Lynn's overdose was
really rough for you.

19:53.859 --> 19:55.694
-Shut up.
-You feel a lot of guilt about that?

19:55.777 --> 19:59.072
You feel a lot of guilt because you were
the only father figure she ever had,

19:59.156 --> 20:00.908
and when she came to you for help, you--

20:00.991 --> 20:03.076
-Hey, how you doing?
-You folks having a good time?

20:03.160 --> 20:04.870
You look great. Thanks for coming.

20:04.953 --> 20:06.914
-You had sex with her?
-That's-- ! No.

20:06.997 --> 20:10.542
And then when she was sober,
you took her on a month-long bender?

20:10.626 --> 20:14.755
And then she died. And she is dead now.
And you're still alive.

20:14.838 --> 20:17.549
With a girlfriend, who is also alive,
and a TV show.

20:17.633 --> 20:21.720
And that's been really hard for  you,
the main character in this story.

20:21.803 --> 20:24.181
Why are you bringing this shit up?
Is this fun for you?

20:24.264 --> 20:25.933
-To really rub in--
-It's not  fun.

20:26.016 --> 20:28.644
You win! You scored all the points
in the argument!

20:28.727 --> 20:32.231
According to facts, you are right
and I am wrong, like always.

20:32.314 --> 20:35.275
But you know what? I don't care.
Because I'm trying to move forward.

20:35.359 --> 20:36.693
You haven't changed at all.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.738
Yes! Congratulations!
You are the last person to get that.

20:39.821 --> 20:43.867
I'm not gonna  change.
I don't need your  help  for  changing,

20:43.951 --> 20:45.827
so you can stop trying
to make me your project.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.996
-That's not--
-When I met you, I was depressed

20:48.080 --> 20:49.498
because I didn't like myself.

20:49.581 --> 20:52.501
And when you wrote that book
and sold a bajillion copies,

20:52.584 --> 20:56.004
you taught me that as screwed up
as I am, that's okay.

20:56.797 --> 20:59.132
You  did that. And now I'm okay.

20:59.716 --> 21:01.134
I don't believe that's true.

21:01.677 --> 21:04.554
And I don't think you believe it's true.

21:04.638 --> 21:08.058
I think you want me to tell you
that you can be better.

21:08.141 --> 21:12.271
And even though you're being
a total asshole right now,

21:12.354 --> 21:13.730
I still believe it.

21:13.814 --> 21:15.482
If all you've gotten
out of this friendship,

21:15.565 --> 21:19.027
is the idea that you should be okay
with yourself, as you are,

21:19.111 --> 21:21.655
then I don't think
this is a good relationship...

21:21.738 --> 21:22.739
for either of us.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.449
-Diane, come on.
-I'm going home.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.328
No, Diane, we're saying things,
but let's just go back to the party.

21:28.412 --> 21:30.330
I'm done... with all of this.

21:30.414 --> 21:32.457
I went to New Mexico to see Charlotte.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.127
She was married with a daughter.

21:35.210 --> 21:36.962
But it wasn't like...
what you're thinking.

21:37.045 --> 21:39.965
She was 17, which is the legal age
of consent in New Mexico,

21:40.048 --> 21:43.427
and she wasn't drunk, so,
not that I wanted to, I never... I didn't.

21:43.510 --> 21:46.221
That's the dumbest part of all of this!
I didn't do anything.

21:46.305 --> 21:48.849
I mean, the fact that this has turned
into such a thing for you--

21:48.932 --> 21:51.643
you know, maybe I didn't tell you
because there was nothing to tell.

21:51.727 --> 21:53.979
Did you ever think of that?
She was my friend's daughter,

21:54.062 --> 21:56.106
and she wanted it, and I was... [breathes]

21:56.189 --> 21:58.775
I was in a bad place
because Charlotte had just--

21:58.859 --> 22:01.570
So, then she came onto my boat,
Charlotte, I mean,

22:01.653 --> 22:03.572
and she walked in,
and I was with her daughter.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.490
But again, nothing had happened yet.

22:06.116 --> 22:07.784
-"Yet?"
-Nothing happened.

22:07.868 --> 22:09.161
Goodbye, BoJack.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.329
-Diane, no!
-Hey-- Aah!

22:10.412 --> 22:12.664
You wanted me to tell you. I told you.
You know everything.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.624
-Please let go of me.
-Diane, please.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.419
You're hurting me,
and I would like you to let go now.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.713
[winces, sighs]

22:19.796 --> 22:21.006
[sighs]

22:22.466 --> 22:23.759
[spits, gulps]

22:26.303 --> 22:27.304
[gulps, sighs]

22:34.978 --> 22:36.229
[whirring]

22:37.147 --> 22:40.317
-So, what'd you think of the show, boss?
-[Henry]  More, more.

22:40.400 --> 22:42.152
Well, all ten episodes

22:42.235 --> 22:44.821
-will be on our website at midnight.
-More.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.283
-You want more episodes?
-Give it to me.

22:49.076 --> 22:52.913
Ooh! Flip! They're picking us up
for more episodes!

22:53.080 --> 22:56.792
Wow. And my mother said
I'd never last as long as  Hung.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.710
Well, who's  Hung  now, Mom?

22:58.835 --> 22:59.878
Uh, right.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.049
[puffs] Ugh.

23:04.925 --> 23:06.927
[grunts] Ow! Oh, ah!

23:07.511 --> 23:09.513
-[wires whizzes]
-[breaks lamp]

23:12.015 --> 23:13.308
Uh...

23:13.809 --> 23:16.144
-Oh. Hey!
-Hey.

23:16.228 --> 23:18.605
-You're leaving?
-Yeah. You?

23:18.688 --> 23:20.065
I'm just getting some air.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.984
No, wrong Prius.
I'm sorry I lost my ticket!

23:23.485 --> 23:25.320
-[sighs]
-[chuckles]

23:25.404 --> 23:26.446
Want me to drive you home?

23:26.530 --> 23:28.198
You can come back
and get your car tomorrow?

23:28.281 --> 23:29.491
You don't have to do that.

23:29.574 --> 23:31.785
Of course not.
I don't have to do anything.

23:32.994 --> 23:35.705
-[camera shutters clicking]
-[guests laughing]

23:36.123 --> 23:37.541
Gina, I know it's early,

23:37.624 --> 23:40.168
but have you started writing
your acceptance speech for the Emmys?

23:40.335 --> 23:43.672
Oh, stop. I'll probably just repurpose
whatever I say at the SAG Awards.

23:43.755 --> 23:45.298
-[laughter]
-Is that gonna read as cocky?

23:45.507 --> 23:48.802
Can you explain to your readers
that I'm being charmingly self-effacing?

23:49.386 --> 23:51.471
-Excuse me.
-Oh, hey, hot stuff! Whoa!

23:51.555 --> 23:53.598
-[reporter gasps]
-[camera shutters clicking]

23:53.682 --> 23:55.308
[Gina moans]

24:03.817 --> 24:04.901
Thanks.

24:04.985 --> 24:08.947
And, great job, by the way.
You're really good on the show.

24:09.030 --> 24:12.617
Yeah? No. Me? No. Yeah?

24:12.701 --> 24:16.913
Yeah! You're a good actor.
I never knew that about you.

24:16.997 --> 24:18.707
Well, I'll see you back on set, right?

24:18.790 --> 24:20.625
Did you hear we got picked up
for more episodes?

24:20.709 --> 24:22.335
I'm not going back.

24:22.419 --> 24:25.088
Oh. Well, then,
I guess I'll see you around.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.632
I hope so. [chuckles]

24:27.716 --> 24:30.719
I can't believe I finally got you
to leave a party early.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.305
Come on, you know I'd do anything for you.

24:33.388 --> 24:37.934
-Why? I'm such a disaster.
-You're not a disaster.

24:38.018 --> 24:40.312
You're Diane. You're amazing.

24:45.775 --> 24:46.860
Do you wanna come in?

24:48.778 --> 24:50.989
