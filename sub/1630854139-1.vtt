00:22.400 --> 00:23.880
Hello?

00:32.880 --> 00:34.440
Who's there?

00:50.080 --> 00:51.320
Hi.

00:51.320 --> 00:55.440
Hello...? Oh! He spoke to me!
He knows I exist!

01:01.400 --> 01:04.280
They're early!
Alison, I can see their car!

01:04.280 --> 01:05.600
What is he talking about?

01:05.600 --> 01:07.520
Our first guests, down at
the Gatehouse.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.480
The Gatehouse?! So exciting.
Oh!

01:10.480 --> 01:11.840
Do you want to go, or shall I?

01:11.840 --> 01:14.160
But who are they?
Is there a vetting process?

01:14.160 --> 01:15.400
Shall we go together?

01:15.400 --> 01:17.360
Er, sure. Yeah.
Or is that creepy?

01:17.360 --> 01:19.200
Oh. Er... You go. You go.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.040
Good luck.
OK. All right. Won't be long.

01:21.040 --> 01:23.720
What are their connections?
What is their circumstance?

01:23.720 --> 01:26.040
Or are you just inviting people
in willy-nilly?

01:26.040 --> 01:27.440
I quite agree, Fanny.

01:27.440 --> 01:30.080
They're just coming for their
holidays! Their what?

01:30.080 --> 01:32.520
I mean, I can show you
their booking if you really want.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.960
I'm sure they're a lovely couple.

01:33.960 --> 01:35.440
It's their anniversary.

01:35.440 --> 01:36.880
Oh! Hello?

01:36.880 --> 01:39.840
Dirty weekend?
Don't even think about it.

01:39.840 --> 01:42.520
What? They're the first ones
to leave a review, OK?

01:42.520 --> 01:45.080
It has to go well.
Just leave them alone.

01:45.080 --> 01:47.680
All right, all right,
all right, fun police.

01:47.680 --> 01:50.080
What is she thinking?
Honestly!

01:50.080 --> 01:53.200
The body
had been remarkably preserved

01:53.200 --> 01:54.720
over the centuries in the ice.

01:54.720 --> 01:56.600
Using state-of-the-art
3D modelling,

01:56.600 --> 01:59.440
researchers have been able
to create this image

01:59.440 --> 02:01.640
of what the iceman
would have looked like.

02:01.640 --> 02:03.920
And viewers
can see the full story

02:03.920 --> 02:06.960
in tonight's special,
The Man In The Ice.

02:06.960 --> 02:09.160
I know that guy!
Huh?

02:31.520 --> 02:35.000
...with me, Robin.
Honestly! I swear on my life.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.560
You're dead, mate!

02:36.560 --> 02:38.760
I mean, it could be anyone.
They all, y'know...

02:38.760 --> 02:40.240
They what? Look the same?

02:40.240 --> 02:43.960
I didn't say that. You do tell a lot
of tall tales, truth be told.

02:43.960 --> 02:46.480
Look, I met the guy.

02:46.480 --> 02:48.320
When? Where?

02:48.320 --> 02:50.320
Well, I don't know.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.880
It was long time ago!

02:51.880 --> 02:53.360
Hmm... I met him!

02:54.840 --> 02:56.800
Ooh...!

02:56.800 --> 03:00.160
It is exciting meeting someone
off the telly, though, isn't it?

03:00.160 --> 03:01.640
You know, someone famous?

03:01.640 --> 03:04.400
I actually met Bobby Davro
in the changing rooms

03:04.400 --> 03:06.080
of the Thimbleby Leisure Centre.

03:06.080 --> 03:07.840
I lent him my talc.

03:07.840 --> 03:10.920
Mm. I met Field Marshal
Harold Alexander.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.280
Bally hero. Anyone else?

03:13.280 --> 03:15.800
Byron. Was a tosspot.

03:15.800 --> 03:17.880
I suppose if I'd lived
a little longer,

03:17.880 --> 03:19.720
I might have met
someone interesting.

03:19.720 --> 03:21.760
I met the Elephant Man.

03:21.760 --> 03:23.040
Elephant Man?

03:23.040 --> 03:25.200
What? You met John Merrick?
What was he like?

03:25.200 --> 03:26.960
Rather boring. Couldn't
see the fuss.

03:26.960 --> 03:29.080
Hmm, let me see...

03:29.080 --> 03:31.440
How about... the Queen?!

03:31.440 --> 03:33.240
Ooh! Very good.

03:33.240 --> 03:34.400
Beat that.

03:34.400 --> 03:36.000
Henry VIII.

03:37.720 --> 03:39.200
Even better. Touche.

03:39.200 --> 03:41.560
I think Humphrey takes it.

03:41.560 --> 03:43.360
How did it go? Did you show them
round? Yeah.

03:43.360 --> 03:44.720
Did they like
the bottle of wine?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.760
I don't know. They didn't
drink it in front of me.

03:46.760 --> 03:48.440
Well, how did they seem?
They seemed...

03:48.440 --> 03:50.920
...all right. Yeah. They didn't
really say much, to be honest.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.240
Oh. Probably waiting for you
to get out

03:53.240 --> 03:55.720
so they could get it on!

03:55.720 --> 03:57.520
Do you think
they were disappointed?

03:57.520 --> 03:59.240
Maybe the photos
make it look too good.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.320
Or maybe they just had a long
journey. So they were tired.

04:02.320 --> 04:05.200
I don't know! Well, did they ask
for anything else?

04:05.200 --> 04:07.320
Just extra pillows.
Great. Cool. Yeah.

04:07.320 --> 04:10.160
Well, we can do that. I'll just go to
the basement and get some covers.

04:10.160 --> 04:12.000
OK. Alison?

04:12.000 --> 04:14.280
I'll come, too.
Oh! Erm...

04:14.280 --> 04:17.440
Extra pillows?! Who do these people
think they are,

04:17.440 --> 04:19.400
the Princess and the Pea?!

04:19.400 --> 04:21.880
What? I knew you'd
regret this, Alison.

04:21.880 --> 04:23.800
You've got a couple
of perfect strangers

04:23.800 --> 04:26.760
in the servants' quarters
while you, the lady of the house,

04:26.760 --> 04:29.320
running around after them
like the maid.

04:29.320 --> 04:31.880
The world's gone
absolutely topsy-turvy.

04:31.880 --> 04:34.800
They're on holiday, that's all.
And they're paying us.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.160
Exactly. You're the staff.

04:36.160 --> 04:37.600
Oh...

04:37.600 --> 04:41.080
Ah! I'd love a little holiday, me.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.720
What be "holly day"?

04:43.720 --> 04:46.280
You mean you've never
been on holiday, Mary?

04:46.280 --> 04:47.720
Don't think so.

04:48.720 --> 04:51.680
Oh, Mary! Where do I start?

04:52.680 --> 04:54.920
Can I come with you
to see the guests?

04:54.920 --> 04:58.280
Erm, it's a bit... I kind of
want to be able to concentrate.

04:58.280 --> 05:01.360
Come on, then, tell us.
What did he say?

05:01.360 --> 05:03.880
He said hello to me. Well, he said
hello to both of us.

05:03.880 --> 05:07.280
Well, he was looking at me.
Was he? Yeah. I don't know he was.

05:07.280 --> 05:08.880
Does he look as good
in real life?

05:08.880 --> 05:11.560
All right. He looked
better, if anything.

05:11.560 --> 05:13.800
He's so elegant,
the way he moves, in't he?

05:13.800 --> 05:17.200
Really, like, demure,
like a... flamingo or something.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.120
Yeah.
Ooh!

05:19.120 --> 05:21.920
Are you talking about Thomas?
Yeah.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.280
I just wish I could get to know
him. I reckon he'd be really

05:24.280 --> 05:25.920
sensitive and attentive.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.760
Yeah, careful
what you wish for!

05:29.240 --> 05:32.840
I mean, I know him.
He's one of my best friends.

05:32.840 --> 05:35.480
I could definitely introduce
you to him, if you like.

05:35.480 --> 05:36.520
What?!

05:36.520 --> 05:39.880
That is such a good idea,
Kitty. He would love that.

05:39.880 --> 05:42.240
Are you serious?
Really? My Lord!

05:42.240 --> 05:45.280
In real, real life?
I can't believe that.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.840
Are you all right?

05:47.840 --> 05:49.200
What happened to yous?

05:50.800 --> 05:52.800
Just excited. Yeah. Yeah!

05:56.200 --> 05:59.760
I just remember his name!
The guy from the television.

05:59.760 --> 06:01.040
What was it?

06:01.040 --> 06:02.840
Hat.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.080
Sorry, "Hat"?

06:04.080 --> 06:05.400
Hat.

06:05.400 --> 06:06.560
Like... a hat?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.600
Yeah, but this was before hats.

06:08.600 --> 06:10.520
Well, they're not going
to find out his name

06:10.520 --> 06:12.000
by studying his bones, are they?

06:12.000 --> 06:13.800
This doesn't prove
a thing, Robin.

06:13.800 --> 06:14.960
His name was Hat!

06:14.960 --> 06:18.280
Oh! I remember now,
we make a trade.

06:18.280 --> 06:22.320
He give me furs and I give
him special tool.

06:23.640 --> 06:27.560
It was a stone tied to a stick!
He's so naive.

06:27.560 --> 06:30.440
You can say what you like, Robin,
but it's hardly evidence, is it?

06:30.440 --> 06:32.960
Hmm? Ach!

06:35.120 --> 06:38.040
Ooh! Alison!
Bogeys at six o'clock.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.720
Oh, they're with me.
Hiya, Thomas.

06:40.720 --> 06:43.000
Hi. How are you doing today?
All right?

06:43.000 --> 06:44.720
Er, yes, thank you.

06:44.720 --> 06:47.480
So, these guys are really,
really big fans of yours,

06:47.480 --> 06:50.160
and if it's not too much trouble,
they'd like to meet you.

06:50.160 --> 06:51.520
Really?

06:51.520 --> 06:54.240
I was... meant to start
working on a new...

06:54.240 --> 06:56.560
...but... but it's fine, it can
wait. Bring them forward.

06:56.560 --> 06:58.040
Come forward.

06:58.040 --> 07:00.680
Yes, that's it.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.560
Hi. Hello.

07:02.560 --> 07:05.160
Can I just say,
I think you're amazing.

07:05.160 --> 07:06.480
We think you're amazing.

07:06.480 --> 07:08.400
Really amazing.
Thank you.

07:08.400 --> 07:09.920
Can I ask you a question?

07:09.920 --> 07:12.120
Er, yes, quickly. Be quick.

07:12.120 --> 07:14.080
What's your favourite, erm...

07:14.080 --> 07:15.640
...animal?
That's a good one.

07:15.640 --> 07:17.200
Probably a wild tiger.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.880
Yes! I told you!

07:18.880 --> 07:20.680
I told YOU that! Yes? You?

07:20.680 --> 07:22.760
Er, wh-wh-what's
your favourite colour?

07:22.760 --> 07:24.160
Burgundy, big time.

07:25.560 --> 07:27.400
No way!

07:27.400 --> 07:28.920
Alison? Yeah?

07:28.920 --> 07:31.640
What the bally heck
is going on?

07:31.640 --> 07:34.920
Ah. They took a bit of a shine
to my painting of Thomas

07:34.920 --> 07:36.840
in the basement. Right.

07:36.840 --> 07:39.040
And now he's some sort of demi-god?

07:39.040 --> 07:41.360
They love him. What's
wrong with that?

07:41.360 --> 07:44.160
It's absurd! I mean, look at him.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.480
Alison, could we have a picture
with Thomas, please?

07:46.480 --> 07:48.240
Er, yeah, all right. OK.

07:48.240 --> 07:49.840
Very well.

07:49.840 --> 07:52.000
Can you do that?

07:53.800 --> 07:56.080
In-between you both?
Yeah, yeah.

07:57.920 --> 08:00.160
Oh, yeah. Oh. Yeah.

08:00.160 --> 08:01.400
Er, did you mean a painting?

08:01.400 --> 08:04.000
Oh, yeah. Doesn't have to be a big
one. Yeah just a little one.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.000
No! What's the matter with her?

08:06.000 --> 08:08.320
Cow. She's not doing the painting?

08:08.320 --> 08:10.640
For goodness' sake!
Don't ask, don't get.

08:10.640 --> 08:11.720
Yeah, exactly.

08:11.720 --> 08:14.200
She's not doing them today, guys.
She's not doing paintings.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.560
What about tomorrow? You'd have to
ask about tomorrow.

08:16.560 --> 08:18.280
I will.

08:26.720 --> 08:29.720
Oh-ho-ho! Didn't take long!

08:34.240 --> 08:35.400
Wha'?

08:40.240 --> 08:41.320
Ah!

08:43.280 --> 08:44.720
Oh!

08:44.720 --> 08:47.360
Great minds, eh?
Er, well, no, no.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.120
I simply wanted to see
who was lording it over Alison.

08:50.120 --> 08:52.680
Well, I'll let you know
when the action starts.

08:52.680 --> 08:55.000
I told you, I'm not
remotely interested

08:55.000 --> 08:57.960
in watching this man and his wife
in the throes of marital...

09:01.840 --> 09:03.480
Oh!

09:06.760 --> 09:09.040
Your pillows.
I'm Alison, by the way.

09:09.040 --> 09:12.120
Shameful! Simpering like a servant!

09:12.120 --> 09:14.680
Hello? Hello!

09:14.680 --> 09:16.920
...and I said we were happy
to have them, and if there's

09:16.920 --> 09:18.960
anything else they need,
they should let us know.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.120
Right. And what did he say?

09:20.120 --> 09:22.360
He said they would let us
know if they need anything.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.120
OK, so... what's the problem?

09:24.120 --> 09:27.360
I just... I didn't get a good vibe.
Like, they didn't seem...

09:27.360 --> 09:29.400
...happy. What, like he was rude?

09:29.400 --> 09:32.360
No, just, like, weren't...

09:32.360 --> 09:34.400
...holiday-fied.

09:34.400 --> 09:36.720
Really? Well, do you think
there's something wrong

09:36.720 --> 09:39.160
with the room? Maybe those photos
do make it look too good.

09:39.160 --> 09:41.560
Maybe. But what if it's nothing
to do with the room?

09:41.560 --> 09:42.960
Then that's not our fault.

09:42.960 --> 09:44.720
Yeah, but we want them
to have a good time.

09:44.720 --> 09:46.560
Yeah, but we can't make them
have a good time.

09:46.560 --> 09:49.240
If they don't have a good time,
they won't leave a good review.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.520
Yeah. Well, what do we do?

09:51.520 --> 09:54.720
Maybe you should go. I am not
asking them if they're unhappy.

09:54.720 --> 09:58.440
No! But just, y'know,
kind of go in

09:58.440 --> 10:01.600
under the radar,
just see what's up. Ah. Right.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.080
Like, "Here's another pillow,
in case six isn't enough.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.560
"Ooh! Are you depressed?"

10:05.560 --> 10:08.920
Yeah. Maybe it'd just
make things worse.

10:08.920 --> 10:10.240
Yeah.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.160
This is hard. Yeah!

10:16.520 --> 10:18.640
There! You see?

10:18.640 --> 10:20.360
Tossa de Mar.

10:20.360 --> 10:21.760
Paradise.

10:21.760 --> 10:23.840
But that's across the seas!

10:23.840 --> 10:26.160
You must have journeyed
for days and days!

10:26.160 --> 10:30.280
Oh, no, no, because we flew
there on an aeroplane.

10:30.280 --> 10:34.120
Ohhh! Yes! Now, to get the most
out of your holiday,

10:34.120 --> 10:38.440
you need to get an early flight,
so we'd get Daley up about 3am.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.960
3am, before the birds?!

10:39.960 --> 10:44.160
Yeah! Get him in the Datsun.
Ten-pence piece for the toll,

10:44.160 --> 10:46.080
Blue Riband in the glove box,

10:46.080 --> 10:49.440
Status Quo in the tape deck,
and you're on the motorway.

10:49.440 --> 10:51.640
Now, you need
to get to the airport

10:51.640 --> 10:53.760
at least four hours
before your flight

10:53.760 --> 10:56.640
so you can check in your bags
and go through passport control.

10:56.640 --> 10:57.760
Passp...?

10:57.760 --> 11:00.000
Passport! Passport, yeah...

11:00.000 --> 11:01.800
Yeah, yeah. It's an
official document

11:01.800 --> 11:03.480
given to you by the Government.

11:03.480 --> 11:05.640
It offers you protection
as a British citizen

11:05.640 --> 11:07.840
should you get into any trouble.

11:07.840 --> 11:08.960
Troubles?!

11:08.960 --> 11:12.160
Yeah, like, y'know,
if you lose your luggage, say,

11:12.160 --> 11:13.480
or, erm, find yourself

11:13.480 --> 11:16.000
in the middle of a military coup
and need to be evacuated.

11:16.000 --> 11:17.160
Oh...

11:17.160 --> 11:18.640
But that only happened once.

11:18.640 --> 11:21.000
Now, duty-free!

11:21.000 --> 11:25.040
We're talking gin, Toblerones,
fags, if you smoke 'em.

11:25.040 --> 11:27.080
He had a tattoo!

11:27.080 --> 11:28.880
Hat, he had a tattoo on his back.

11:28.880 --> 11:30.320
Mm.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.640
Sailor, was he? Or a convict?

11:32.640 --> 11:33.760
What was it?

11:33.760 --> 11:35.640
It was like a big X.

11:35.640 --> 11:36.880
X marks the spot!

11:36.880 --> 11:39.360
Where was the treasure?
In his bottom?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.000
He's so funny! He's so funny!

11:44.000 --> 11:46.280
He's so quick!

11:46.280 --> 11:49.440
Look, his name was Hat,
gave me this fur,

11:49.440 --> 11:51.840
had a tattoo on his back.

11:51.840 --> 11:53.960
Again, Robin, this proves nothing.

11:53.960 --> 11:56.400
Yes. I mean,
you could tell us he had a...

11:56.400 --> 11:58.960
He's going to say something funny
again. Listen to this. Shhh!

11:58.960 --> 12:01.320
Shut up! Oh, here it comes!

12:01.320 --> 12:03.800
That's spoiled it now!

12:03.800 --> 12:05.960
Whatever it was,
it was going to be funny.

12:05.960 --> 12:08.640
Yeah, definitely!
And clever, too, probably.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.360
Why are they here?

12:10.360 --> 12:12.520
Why are you here?

12:12.520 --> 12:14.320
Why are you fawning over this man?

12:14.320 --> 12:16.840
What has he done to
earn your admiration?

12:16.840 --> 12:20.160
Well, he's famous, in't he?
My mate said he was famous.

12:20.160 --> 12:21.520
Yeah, I said that.

12:21.520 --> 12:22.840
Oh, good grief!

12:22.840 --> 12:24.800
I mean, if you're going to
adulate somebody,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.280
at least choose
a person of merit,

12:26.280 --> 12:28.880
a person who's achieved
something. Churchill. Monty.

12:28.880 --> 12:31.800
Lord Brigadier Sir Anthony
Bartholomew Raisinby Jones.

12:33.520 --> 12:35.280
Who? Who?

12:35.280 --> 12:36.920
Heroes.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.720
Men.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.480
I need some air.

12:42.480 --> 12:43.720
Oh, I think he's off.

12:43.720 --> 12:44.960
I wonder where he's going.

12:44.960 --> 12:48.000
Maybe he's hot and he needs
to take his top off. Don't, don't!

12:48.000 --> 12:49.560
Oh, it's relentless!

12:49.560 --> 12:52.440
Guys, I think Thomas
needs some space.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.240
I'm afraid he's very busy

12:54.240 --> 12:56.240
and he cannot be disturbed
while he works,

12:56.240 --> 12:58.480
so that's enough for today,
thank you.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.160
What?

13:00.160 --> 13:01.680
He's very busy.

13:05.480 --> 13:07.480
Ohhh!

13:07.480 --> 13:10.320
You all right, Thomas?
Oh, Alison,

13:10.320 --> 13:12.920
you've no idea what it's like
to be pursued endlessly,

13:12.920 --> 13:15.360
obsessively, objectified, harassed,

13:15.360 --> 13:17.400
given no space.

13:17.400 --> 13:20.320
Yeah, that sounds like hell...

13:20.320 --> 13:23.280
You look radiant today,
by the way.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.680
Crikey,
this is depressing.

13:26.680 --> 13:28.960
Yes. I thought my marriage
was cold.

13:28.960 --> 13:32.120
See? This is what happens when you
get to know each other too well.

13:32.120 --> 13:34.400
No mystery left, no spark.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.840
A fine excuse. I'm sure
there's plenty of spark

13:36.840 --> 13:38.360
under the surface.

13:38.360 --> 13:40.600
Well, it takes two to tango.

13:40.600 --> 13:42.640
Hmm.

13:42.640 --> 13:45.440
Oh! Seriously? It's half nine!

13:45.440 --> 13:48.920
Which is a perfectly acceptable time
for a lady to retire.

13:48.920 --> 13:50.120
You would say that.

13:50.120 --> 13:51.920
And what exactly
do you mean by that?

13:51.920 --> 13:54.200
Well, you're a square,
aren't you? Just like her.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.520
Oh! You've never known
how to handle a woman...

14:04.880 --> 14:06.720
Tea and coffee there.

14:07.920 --> 14:12.440
Oh, Mary! Holiday breakfasts!
Heaven on Earth!

14:12.440 --> 14:15.840
You can have cereals
and a cooked breakfast.

14:15.840 --> 14:19.520
And pastries! You have to
make sure you time it right,

14:19.520 --> 14:21.880
because they leave the cooked
bits in the serving trays,

14:21.880 --> 14:24.960
so you've got to go up when a fresh
batch of scrambled eggs go in.

14:24.960 --> 14:26.200
Then you've got to pounce!

14:26.200 --> 14:28.760
Otherwise you load your plate
up with sausages and beans

14:28.760 --> 14:30.640
and so on, only to find
you're stuck with

14:30.640 --> 14:32.920
the cold, milky scraps
at the bottom of the tray!

14:32.920 --> 14:35.040
Oh, no! Yeah.

14:35.040 --> 14:38.000
Anyway, after breakfast...

14:38.000 --> 14:39.240
...it's off to the beach!

14:39.240 --> 14:40.600
Yay! Weather permitting.

14:40.600 --> 14:42.840
Oh, yeah... Yeah.

14:46.440 --> 14:47.960
They're not talking
to each other.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.800
Right. Something's definitely up.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.600
I mean, maybe they didn't sleep
very well.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.520
I told you we should have tried
that mattress!

14:53.520 --> 14:55.680
You're joking! That mattress
is better than ours.

14:55.680 --> 14:56.920
It cost more than the TV.

14:56.920 --> 14:59.160
Well, hopefully
this'll cheer them up.

14:59.160 --> 15:01.440
Oh, my God! Full of conversation
this morning...!

15:01.440 --> 15:04.840
Ha! Ready and waiting, if there's
a conversation to be had.

15:04.840 --> 15:06.680
Oh, really? I hadn't noticed.

15:06.680 --> 15:10.040
Maybe if she took her head out of
her smartphone for one second,

15:10.040 --> 15:12.040
he might think it was
worth saying something.

15:12.040 --> 15:13.320
She's busy.

15:13.320 --> 15:17.240
Leave your work at home, love!
Supposed to be on holiday, yeah?

15:17.240 --> 15:19.200
Well, would he rather be
with his wife

15:19.200 --> 15:20.920
or going off on his bicycle?

15:20.920 --> 15:22.280
She may as well be working,

15:22.280 --> 15:24.800
if he's more interested
in that contraption.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.840
Anything else I can get you?
No, it's fine.

15:26.840 --> 15:30.920
No. Nothing more, thank you. OK.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.160
I've got some intel. Ooh.

15:33.160 --> 15:35.880
Ah, that's enough butter,
thank you.

15:35.880 --> 15:37.920
Oh! There he is! There he is!

15:37.920 --> 15:40.760
Oh, my goodness, the dew is still
upon the grass,

15:40.760 --> 15:42.960
and already they come
for their pound of flesh.

15:44.000 --> 15:46.040
Katherine, would you be
a darling and detain them

15:46.040 --> 15:48.480
while I compose myself?
Of course!

15:48.480 --> 15:50.240
Right, morning, everyone.

15:50.240 --> 15:53.160
Thomas will be able to do some
meeting and greeting shortly,

15:53.160 --> 15:55.840
so if I can ask you
to please form a queue...

15:55.840 --> 15:57.960
Actually, I've slept here.
You pushed in.

15:57.960 --> 16:01.280
No! No! All right, we all
get a turn. Will we all get a turn?

16:02.480 --> 16:04.400
Robin! Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey-hey!

16:05.960 --> 16:07.880
You heard lady! Form a queue!

16:07.880 --> 16:09.600
Why are you stood
in front of me?

16:09.600 --> 16:11.320
Excuse me... All right!

16:12.400 --> 16:15.320
It's empty, you know.
All this.

16:15.320 --> 16:17.560
They don't know the first thing
about you, Thorne.

16:17.560 --> 16:19.560
They've just formed
this... infatuation

16:19.560 --> 16:21.080
based on an image.

16:21.080 --> 16:22.720
They're waiting on the stairs.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.360
I thought you could have
an hour now

16:24.360 --> 16:26.600
to relax and then a meet-and-greet
with the fans,

16:26.600 --> 16:28.360
which will take you
up until Food Club,

16:28.360 --> 16:30.080
or I can get you out of that,
if you want.

16:30.080 --> 16:32.560
Wonderful, Kitty. I don't know
what I'd do without you.

16:32.560 --> 16:34.640
No, it's a pleasure
to be on the team.

16:34.640 --> 16:35.800
Ridiculous!

16:35.800 --> 16:38.640
You mustn't be so
jealous, Captain.

16:38.640 --> 16:40.760
Believe me,
you wouldn't want this.

16:40.760 --> 16:44.480
It's a tiresome consequence
of the life of a successful artist.

16:44.480 --> 16:46.400
They don't care about your art!

16:46.400 --> 16:49.640
Faradiddle, sir! They love me
for my poems.

16:49.640 --> 16:51.080
Tish-tosh!

16:51.080 --> 16:53.240
Fine. We'll prove it.

16:53.240 --> 16:55.080
Katherine, change of plan.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.360
Tell the creatures I shall give
a recital in the ballroom at noon.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.120
Then we shall see!

17:01.120 --> 17:03.320
Mm. And then we'll see.

17:03.320 --> 17:05.720
And then... we will see.

17:05.720 --> 17:08.640
You're insane. No way.
It's like vandalism.

17:08.640 --> 17:11.360
Or they can have a miserable time
and leave a crappy first review

17:11.360 --> 17:13.440
and ruin our B&B
before it's even started!

17:13.440 --> 17:16.520
What kind of review would you give
if the host slashed your bike tyres?

17:16.520 --> 17:18.760
Not slash. Gently puncture.

17:18.760 --> 17:19.840
What?

17:19.840 --> 17:22.080
We'll make it look like
a stone did it, or something.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.800
And then we'll offer him
a repair kit

17:23.800 --> 17:25.720
and he'll think
we're really helpful.

17:25.720 --> 17:27.480
It is not our job
to fix their marriage.

17:27.480 --> 17:28.880
But imagine if it worked!

17:28.880 --> 17:30.680
It would be the best holiday ever.

17:30.680 --> 17:33.160
It's a small misdemeanour
for the greater good.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.200
Fine. But you're doing
the tyre. Yes!

17:39.480 --> 17:41.720
I forgot to mention,
you've got to get up early

17:41.720 --> 17:43.680
to put your towels
on the sunbeds

17:43.680 --> 17:45.520
before you go to breakfast, yes.

17:45.520 --> 17:47.880
Now, I like to go for a dip first,

17:47.880 --> 17:50.040
before I put my sun cream on,

17:50.040 --> 17:51.520
otherwise you just wash it off.

17:51.520 --> 17:54.520
And believe me, you don't want
to have sunburn! No!

17:54.520 --> 17:57.920
Daley got it so bad once,
we had to cover his whole body

17:57.920 --> 18:00.720
in bicarbonate of soda!
And that were on t'first day!

18:00.720 --> 18:03.560
So we had to keep him
in t'shade until we went home.

18:03.560 --> 18:07.120
And then, a week later,
he shed his skin like a snake!

18:07.120 --> 18:09.600
And then there was the holiday
where we all got food poisoning

18:09.600 --> 18:11.320
from the dodgy beach melons.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.400
Or the one where someone
pinched me wallet

18:13.400 --> 18:16.000
and the police accused me
of lying! And...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.120
And come to think of it, Mary,

18:18.120 --> 18:20.560
holidays are a bloody nightmare!

18:20.560 --> 18:21.920
Keep clear!

18:23.120 --> 18:25.080
They're nothing but stress.

18:25.080 --> 18:27.480
Sorry. Sorry.

18:27.480 --> 18:29.320
Still...

18:29.320 --> 18:32.040
...sound like an adventure to me!

18:32.040 --> 18:34.960
I never did leave my
town of birth, so...

18:34.960 --> 18:36.440
What, not once?

18:36.440 --> 18:38.440
No, never, no.

18:38.440 --> 18:40.040
No.

18:40.040 --> 18:43.240
Was a life of
toiling the land for us,

18:43.240 --> 18:47.640
you know, outside all the day,
planting, harvesting,

18:47.640 --> 18:51.600
fetching water from the well
and logs for the fire.

18:51.600 --> 18:54.400
Teaching the childrens
how to weave baskets

18:54.400 --> 18:55.960
five potatoes high!

18:55.960 --> 18:59.360
Feeding the livestock
and picking fruit.

18:59.360 --> 19:02.280
Oh, and pressing apples
for the cider.

19:02.280 --> 19:05.680
Sometimes would my husband
go to the lake to fish,

19:05.680 --> 19:07.120
and then I would join him

19:07.120 --> 19:09.560
and prepare a fire
to cook the catch.

19:09.560 --> 19:13.440
And then would we huddle
under a blanket and eat

19:13.440 --> 19:16.240
as the sun sank
beyond the trees

19:16.240 --> 19:18.440
and the birds sang
for their bedtimes.

19:21.240 --> 19:23.560
Well! Mary...

19:24.560 --> 19:26.640
...one day of your life

19:26.640 --> 19:28.880
sounds like my perfect holiday.

19:30.280 --> 19:32.360
Five stars.

19:32.360 --> 19:35.600
Oh. Well, I suppose
it was all right.

19:37.040 --> 19:39.320
Up to a point.

19:39.320 --> 19:42.360
Sure. Sure.

20:29.120 --> 20:32.160
I hope you're right about this.

20:32.160 --> 20:33.560
Mm.

20:39.120 --> 20:40.320
Oh, it's so exciting!

20:40.320 --> 20:42.560
Do you have a ticket?
I didn't know we needed...

20:42.560 --> 20:45.120
Well, they're make-believe, so...

20:45.120 --> 20:47.120
Thank you! Ticket, please.

20:47.120 --> 20:48.400
Thank you!

20:55.080 --> 20:58.640
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for -

20:58.640 --> 21:00.920
an audience with Thomas Thorne.

21:08.640 --> 21:11.360
Sh, sh, sh, sh.

21:12.920 --> 21:14.880
Hmm...

21:14.880 --> 21:17.080
This first poem...

21:17.080 --> 21:19.360
...is called Misty Glade.

21:19.360 --> 21:21.800
Misty Glade!
It's good, that.

21:26.800 --> 21:29.640
I hear the running water

21:29.640 --> 21:31.960
It rushes to be with the sea

21:31.960 --> 21:33.160
And so it is with me

21:34.680 --> 21:37.400
She stands among the birch and elk

21:37.400 --> 21:39.080
The cobwebs shimmer...

21:39.080 --> 21:41.000
Where are the cobwebs?
I don't know.

21:41.000 --> 21:43.640
Maybe in the branches
of the birch and elk.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.920
The dew dresses
the forest floor

21:46.920 --> 21:48.960
A crystal carpet

21:48.960 --> 21:52.200
And here a door!
That once...

21:52.200 --> 21:54.080
A door in the woods?

21:54.080 --> 21:57.880
I think it might be a metaphor,
like an opening of some kind.

21:57.880 --> 22:00.520
Not a real door?
Cease...

22:00.520 --> 22:02.760
...the chatter.

22:04.640 --> 22:06.480
Thank you.

22:06.480 --> 22:07.960
I'll start again.

22:09.240 --> 22:11.760
I hear the running water

22:11.760 --> 22:13.680
It rushes to be with the sea...

22:14.880 --> 22:17.360
A verdant spr...

22:17.360 --> 22:18.840
That's not how I read it.

22:18.840 --> 22:20.840
May I finish?
Is this going to be long?

22:20.840 --> 22:22.080
Cos I need the toilet.

22:22.080 --> 22:23.680
Is it meant to be more abstract?

22:23.680 --> 22:25.240
I'm sorry, I just don't get it.

22:25.240 --> 22:29.480
You're not supposed to get it,
you philistine wazzock! It's art!

22:31.600 --> 22:34.280
Yeah, but it's confusing.
So confusing!

22:34.280 --> 22:38.320
It is ambiguous.
If you don't like it, get out!

22:38.320 --> 22:41.800
Fine. I will.
No worries, mate.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.120
It's rubbish, anyway.
I don't like it here, anyway.

22:44.120 --> 22:46.320
Sorry, but that's really rude.
You're the wazzock!

22:48.280 --> 22:51.440
Ah! I've got a poem.

22:51.440 --> 22:54.160
There once was a poet
called Thomas

22:54.160 --> 22:57.560
Who suddenly
found himself famous

22:57.560 --> 22:59.040
Thought it was grand

22:59.040 --> 23:01.240
Until then, he find... found...

23:01.240 --> 23:02.640
Well, I can't do it!

23:02.640 --> 23:05.240
The point is, I was right, hmm?

23:05.240 --> 23:08.280
Hmm! Good. Carry on.

23:10.720 --> 23:12.680
Well, I liked it.

23:12.680 --> 23:14.760
You're sweet, Kitty.
You don't have to pretend.

23:14.760 --> 23:18.520
No, really! I especially liked
the one about the egg.

23:18.520 --> 23:21.680
It's funny, I don't like eating
eggs, but I like poems about them.

23:23.280 --> 23:25.960
What was next? I think the diary's
clear now.

23:25.960 --> 23:27.320
Yes.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.800
Alison?

23:42.800 --> 23:44.800
They're coming back!

23:47.840 --> 23:50.120
Awww! It worked!

23:50.120 --> 23:52.520
Looks like it. Yes!

23:52.520 --> 23:53.680
Thanks, guys.

23:53.680 --> 23:55.400
No problem.
You're welcome.

23:55.400 --> 23:58.760
Sometimes, all it takes
is a little bit of connection.

23:58.760 --> 24:00.360
Isn't that right, Julian?

24:00.360 --> 24:03.320
Took the words
right out of my mouth.

24:04.640 --> 24:08.520
Hello! Anniversary is back on!

24:09.680 --> 24:12.000
Everybody, come quick!

24:15.640 --> 24:17.560
Five stars, here we come.

24:23.360 --> 24:25.720
Scientists
have learnt a vast amount...

24:25.720 --> 24:27.160
Oh! This again, is it?

24:27.160 --> 24:28.600
I'm telling you, it's Hat!

24:28.600 --> 24:30.720
The 3D modelling may have revealed
a picture

24:30.720 --> 24:32.920
of what our mountain man
would have looked like,

24:32.920 --> 24:35.080
but what else can
we learn about him?

24:35.080 --> 24:37.080
How might he have sounded,
for example?

24:37.080 --> 24:38.520
He would have been
very resonant

24:38.520 --> 24:41.120
in the chest,
and using this model

24:41.120 --> 24:43.240
gives us a very good idea
of the vowel sounds

24:43.240 --> 24:46.400
the vocal anatomy
could have produced.

24:50.440 --> 24:52.480
Oh, that's very good!

24:52.480 --> 24:54.320
He did have stupid voice.

24:54.320 --> 24:57.560
Incredible to hear him almost
speaking to us across the millennia.

24:57.560 --> 25:00.960
And is there any significance to the
tool that was found with the body?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.880
The edge-it! That's what I gave him!
I told you!

25:03.880 --> 25:05.800
There's
some debate around this.

25:05.800 --> 25:07.560
Perhaps it was
something ceremonial.

25:07.560 --> 25:10.240
Or perhaps it was a practical tool
for opening hard shells.

25:10.240 --> 25:13.560
Yeah! It was a tool for taking furs
off of idiots.

25:13.560 --> 25:16.680
We do know this was a ritualistic
society, as is evidenced

25:16.680 --> 25:18.120
by the tattoo on his back.

25:18.120 --> 25:20.080
Yes! In your face!

25:20.080 --> 25:22.440
Well, I never! My goodness!

25:22.440 --> 25:25.040
Well, clearly we owe you
an apology, Robin.

25:25.040 --> 25:26.680
Well...

25:26.680 --> 25:28.920
...I guess so.

25:28.920 --> 25:30.960
But one thing
the experts agree on

25:30.960 --> 25:33.240
is that the cause of death
was likely hypothermia.

25:33.240 --> 25:35.440
If this man had been wearing
the kind of furs

25:35.440 --> 25:38.680
you would expect of this time,
he would have been well protected.

25:38.680 --> 25:41.040
Those, of course, would have
been preserved with him,

25:41.040 --> 25:46.240
so we can only speculate as to why
he was out here without his furs.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.720
Poor man.

25:47.720 --> 25:51.200
It would have been a...
...cold, lonely death.

25:53.400 --> 25:56.080
You know, actually,
I don't think it is this guy.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.520
That's not Hat. No.

25:57.520 --> 25:59.960
Yeah, he had a very different
tattoo, now I think about it.

25:59.960 --> 26:01.920
It was more like a little cross
than an X.

26:01.920 --> 26:03.520
I don't know who this guy is.

26:03.520 --> 26:05.440
I think we should watch
The Wire.

26:05.440 --> 26:07.760
I want to watch The Wire.
Anyone?

26:08.840 --> 26:12.480
Hmm...

26:20.760 --> 26:22.440
Hmm! A review.

26:23.840 --> 26:28.120
"Lovely house. Pleasant stay.
Wi-Fi was patchy. Three stars."

26:28.120 --> 26:30.000
Ohhh, for fu...

26:34.440 --> 26:36.120
Morning! Hey...

26:36.120 --> 26:37.280
What are you doing here?

26:37.280 --> 26:38.840
I wanted to hear some more about

26:38.840 --> 26:42.200
Lord Brigadier Sir Anthony
Bartholomew Raisinby Jones.

26:42.200 --> 26:43.880
Really?

26:43.880 --> 26:45.320
Oh! Excellent.

26:45.320 --> 26:47.040
Well, erm, fascinating chap, really.

26:47.040 --> 26:48.600
Yeah, I met him at headquarters.

26:48.600 --> 26:50.400
He went on to Africa,
I think...

26:50.400 --> 26:52.560
He really got in amongst it.
Really?
