WEBVTT

00:05.770 --> 00:06.970
In tonight's program...

00:06.970 --> 00:08.700
a supercar from a shed...

00:08.700 --> 00:09.540
in Leicestershire...

00:11.240 --> 00:13.720
A rock star in our reasonably priced car...

00:14.470 --> 00:16.750
And how many motorbikes can you jump...

00:17.080 --> 00:18.590
with a bus?

00:23.450 --> 00:24.640
But first...

00:24.640 --> 00:26.640
the 1960s.

00:26.640 --> 00:31.120
Now it was possible to go fast back then
if you had enough money to buy a Ferrari...

00:31.120 --> 00:32.720
or a Maserati.

00:32.720 --> 00:34.610
But then one day, Ford thought...

00:34.610 --> 00:38.270
hang on a minute, we've got all these
cars, flooding down our production lines...

00:38.270 --> 00:41.310
why don't we fit some of them, with big engines.

00:41.720 --> 00:45.770
Now, if you think about it, this was an
incredibly important moment cause suddenly...

00:45.770 --> 00:48.080
everyone could afford to go fast.

00:48.140 --> 00:50.980
They actually created the boy racer.

00:51.440 --> 00:54.240
Suddenly, Mr. Barrington Smythe
who was doing down the motorway...

00:54.240 --> 00:56.240
got overtaken by Barry Smith.

00:56.460 --> 00:58.390
And we've actually been joined tonight by...

00:58.550 --> 01:01.600
several members of the Ford RS Owners Club.

01:01.600 --> 01:02.360
Here they are.

01:03.350 --> 01:05.459
And let, no... let me give you a flavour of...

01:05.459 --> 01:08.500
the kind of people who drive RS Fords okay?

01:08.500 --> 01:09.680
-Lee.

01:08.500 --> 01:09.680
-Your name is?

01:10.110 --> 01:11.490
Lee? Okay.

01:11.490 --> 01:14.380
Now standing at the back
there, we've got... Wayne.

01:14.380 --> 01:17.590
Okay, now Wayne's girlfriend,
anyone wanna hazard a guess...

01:17.590 --> 01:20.730
what Wayne's girlfriend... Tracy!

01:21.720 --> 01:23.190
So it's...

01:27.990 --> 01:29.410
A word of warning though.

01:29.410 --> 01:32.150
A word of warning, which
I've learned over the years...

01:32.150 --> 01:33.980
Never, ever...

01:33.980 --> 01:36.050
slag off a fast Ford.

01:36.050 --> 01:38.050
Cause these people don't
write polite letters saying...

01:38.050 --> 01:41.220
<i>Dear Sir, I strongly disagree with
what you said on Top Gear the other night.</i>

01:41.220 --> 01:42.340
Just, slug a brick.

01:42.340 --> 01:44.450
Yeah, a brick, with git written on it...

01:44.450 --> 01:46.670
comes through your... window.

01:46.670 --> 01:49.450
And bearing that in mind,
Ford, should be worried.

01:49.450 --> 01:53.410
Because when they dropped
the RS Escort Cosworth here...

01:53.410 --> 01:56.880
they said, there would be
an RS version of the Focus.

01:56.880 --> 01:58.880
They promised us, it would have...

01:58.880 --> 02:00.480
300 horsepower...

02:00.480 --> 02:01.860
and four wheel drive.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.190
And here it is.

02:03.190 --> 02:06.470
Now it is... quite a looker.

02:06.470 --> 02:08.320
Well, it's better looking
than your hair actually...

02:08.620 --> 02:10.990
Sorry mate, but... you got an RS?

02:10.990 --> 02:12.990
RS hairdo that, fantastic.

02:13.530 --> 02:15.990
Anyway, disappointingly, this...

02:15.990 --> 02:18.420
doesn't have 300 horsepower
and four wheel drive, it has...

02:18.420 --> 02:22.230
front wheel drive, and
only 212 brake horsepower.

02:22.230 --> 02:24.350
Still, we're going to be testing it out...

02:24.350 --> 02:27.060
on our track. But first of all,
we thought it'd be a good idea...

02:27.060 --> 02:29.060
to have a look at the competition.

02:29.190 --> 02:32.510
Most obvious contender is this... the Subaru Impreza.

02:32.810 --> 02:34.860
So, we fitted it with the Stig...

02:35.070 --> 02:36.320
and launched him...

02:36.620 --> 02:38.320
onto our test track.

02:40.270 --> 02:42.590
Whereas the Ford is a jumped up road car...

02:42.590 --> 02:44.750
this is a scaled down rally car.

02:44.750 --> 02:46.880
Turbocharged engine, four wheel drive.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.300
Not the best looking car in the world, I admit.

02:50.300 --> 02:53.170
And he crosses the line in...

02:53.230 --> 02:55.730
here we come now, 1...

02:55.730 --> 02:57.730
:39.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.910
Next up is the Honda Civic Type R.

03:01.910 --> 03:04.630
Now what you need to know about
the Civic most of all, is that...

03:04.630 --> 03:06.270
my mother has one.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.030
err, it's a mothery sort of car.

03:08.030 --> 03:10.250
except of course for this one, which is a...

03:10.250 --> 03:11.540
mother of a car.

03:13.030 --> 03:14.240
Is it gonna beat the Subaru?

03:14.240 --> 03:16.950
Is it gonna be faster? Crosses the line in...

03:16.950 --> 03:21.560
1:38.06, and the Honda was faster than the Subaru.

03:21.560 --> 03:24.730
Much to the disappointment of
the Subaru Owners Club, here all...

03:24.730 --> 03:25.500
five of them...

03:25.500 --> 03:29.060
who have been pointing out that if it was
raining, it would've been different, but it wasn't...

03:29.060 --> 03:29.940
and you lost.

03:30.280 --> 03:31.120
You lost.

03:31.470 --> 03:34.140
Anyway, now is the time to find out how...

03:34.140 --> 03:36.140
the watered down Ford gets on.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.060
Traction Control switched off and...

03:42.000 --> 03:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.510 --> 03:53.210
On the left there we've got a
map of the circuit, on the right...

03:53.210 --> 03:56.870
in the centre there's a G-meter there
that shows us how much G we're getting.

03:56.870 --> 03:58.870
Down for acceleration. Up for braking.

03:58.870 --> 04:00.400
Right and left obviously for cornering.

04:00.400 --> 04:02.960
And that was nearly 1G through there, the first corner.

04:03.460 --> 04:04.390
That's amazing.

04:04.770 --> 04:06.820
That's about as much as you could possibly generate...

04:06.820 --> 04:08.970
Corvettes used to generate that much.

04:08.970 --> 04:11.280
Now he's going through the Steady State corner...

04:11.620 --> 04:13.390
45 miles an hour.

04:13.390 --> 04:14.060
50...

04:14.060 --> 04:14.620
60...

04:14.620 --> 04:16.320
66 on the exit.

04:16.320 --> 04:18.600
Foot hard down. Now a really fast car is...

04:18.600 --> 04:20.670
topping the tonne before he has to brake.

04:20.839 --> 04:22.950
90... ooh...

04:22.950 --> 04:25.670
99, didn't quite make the tonne as he brakes...

04:25.670 --> 04:27.130
hard and into the hammerhead.

04:27.390 --> 04:29.400
It's a left, and then a really hard right's...

04:29.400 --> 04:31.610
gonna make understeer, everything understeer...

04:31.790 --> 04:33.610
except the Honda didn't and...

04:34.130 --> 04:35.710
Ooh wow, he's gone a bit wide there...

04:35.710 --> 04:37.710
he's wide on the way out, that's okay. Now...

04:37.710 --> 04:40.360
is he gonna reach 100 here, is he gonna lift?

04:40.360 --> 04:42.360
Is he gonna lift for the Follow Through?

04:42.510 --> 04:44.560
Changed up into fourth, and... yes...

04:44.560 --> 04:47.490
lifted there down to 80 miles
an hour for the Follow Through...

04:47.490 --> 04:49.730
so he didn't follow through, into Bentley Bend.

04:50.310 --> 04:51.730
Into Bentley Bend.

04:51.880 --> 04:52.850
And...

04:52.850 --> 04:56.410
again, this is gonna be the fastest part
of the track, he's flat out through there.

04:56.990 --> 05:01.190
Flat out still, 10... 102
miles an hour, that's very quick.

05:01.450 --> 05:04.440
The Suzuki Liana's only doing 87. Through Baccarat...

05:04.440 --> 05:06.550
Into the really tricky one where you spin all the...

05:06.550 --> 05:07.520
power away.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.940
Is it gonna waste all that power?

05:10.300 --> 05:11.770
How tidy is it, let's look.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.770
That's very tidy.

05:13.770 --> 05:15.580
Well, there's one thing for sure...

05:15.580 --> 05:19.090
the RS Owners Club won't be
poking dog mess through the...

05:19.180 --> 05:21.700
Stig's letter box after that performance.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.770
1:33.80.

05:23.770 --> 05:26.780
That's nearly 4 seconds faster than the Honda.

05:26.780 --> 05:29.580
4 seconds... that's a week...

05:29.800 --> 05:30.700
if you're a dog.

05:31.310 --> 05:32.880
So... plainly...

05:32.880 --> 05:34.710
I had to go and drive this car...

05:34.710 --> 05:36.090
in the real world.

05:36.820 --> 05:37.730
But where?

05:37.980 --> 05:40.680
Obviously it had to be somewhere
with miles and miles of...

05:40.680 --> 05:43.350
empty roads. And that means finding somewhere on there...

05:44.210 --> 05:45.630
where no one wants to live.

06:08.360 --> 06:09.330
Wales!

06:13.610 --> 06:14.320
Sheep.

06:19.820 --> 06:24.190
There are so many empty roads out here,
it's hard to know where to start.

06:26.240 --> 06:28.670
Welcome then, to RS country.

06:29.380 --> 06:33.000
Nothing but the odd woolly
maggot, to spoil the fun.

06:38.840 --> 06:43.840
Sitting here, there's no evidence that I'm
sitting in something that can nuke a Subaru Impreza.

06:44.550 --> 06:48.230
Apart from the sporty seats and the start button and this...

06:48.710 --> 06:50.710
hideous steering wheel...

06:50.710 --> 06:54.000
which appears to have come from a Southall motorist's discounts store...

06:54.000 --> 06:55.510
for 9.99 pounds.

06:55.510 --> 06:57.430
It just feels like a normal...

06:57.430 --> 06:59.450
3-door Focus. And um...

07:01.870 --> 07:03.030
sounds like one too.

07:03.030 --> 07:05.790
And, like a normal focus, there's no cup-holder.

07:05.790 --> 07:09.190
There's nowhere to put my can of... piping hot coffee.

07:17.550 --> 07:21.210
Even when you bury the throttle
into the Dagenham deep pile...

07:21.210 --> 07:23.840
there are still no real clues.

07:25.560 --> 07:29.400
Obviously, it's fast. I mean,
anything with a 2 liter...

07:29.400 --> 07:31.940
turbocharged engine pumping out...

07:31.940 --> 07:33.860
212 brake horsepower...

07:34.440 --> 07:37.370
isn't gonna mooch around like a Saturday shop-girl.

07:39.840 --> 07:40.490
But...

07:41.810 --> 07:44.520
it doesn't have the same straight line oomph...

07:45.080 --> 07:46.700
as a Subaru Impreza.

07:46.700 --> 07:48.980
In fact from 0-100 miles an hour...

07:48.980 --> 07:51.520
this is... 2 seconds slower.

07:54.260 --> 07:57.880
The reason it was so fast around our track is simple...

07:58.070 --> 08:01.060
this thing corners like it's in a cartoon.

08:03.260 --> 08:06.990
Between the front wheels,
there's a new type of differential.

08:06.990 --> 08:08.930
I won't bore you with how it works...

08:08.930 --> 08:10.220
but I will tell you this...

08:10.710 --> 08:14.790
you can turn into any corner,
and seemingly any speed...

08:14.790 --> 08:16.960
and the front just goes... Boof!

08:17.160 --> 08:17.760
Boof.

08:18.450 --> 08:21.700
There's no fuss, no drama, no understeer, just...

08:22.240 --> 08:23.700
endless grip.

08:26.220 --> 08:27.820
It's rather like one of those...

08:28.440 --> 08:30.640
American marines in a Hollywood movie...

08:30.640 --> 08:35.059
Now matter how... suicidal the order,
no matter how stupid... it just obeys.

08:35.210 --> 08:36.630
Sir, yes Sir!

08:37.510 --> 08:40.330
Run in front of all those... enemy guns over there.

08:40.330 --> 08:41.780
Sir, yes Sir!

08:42.730 --> 08:45.650
Go around this hairpin bend at 150 miles an hour.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.250
Sir, yes Sir!

08:47.680 --> 08:51.450
It gets away with it, that's the
joke. It does go around hairpin bends...

08:51.820 --> 08:53.600
at 150 miles an hour.

08:55.800 --> 08:59.290
I have never driven a front wheel 
drive car that drives so well...

08:59.290 --> 09:02.410
I can't think of any car that grips so well. And yet...

09:02.410 --> 09:05.650
this one is yours for less than 20,000 pounds.

09:05.900 --> 09:10.540
So, once again, Ford has delivered
a supercar for supermarket prices.

09:10.540 --> 09:14.870
This car does what all good
Fords should do; it brings power...

09:14.870 --> 09:16.200
to the people.

09:16.650 --> 09:20.700
I mean... look at the badges
you get in this one tiny area.

09:20.810 --> 09:23.200
Brembo... RS... OZ Racing...

09:23.570 --> 09:29.000
In clothing terms that like going around in a pair
of trousers that have been jointly designed by...

09:29.000 --> 09:32.400
Oswald Boateng, Alexander McQueen and Paul Smith.

09:32.850 --> 09:36.620
So, a fantastic car in every way then.

09:37.980 --> 09:38.620
No.

09:39.140 --> 09:40.260
Afraid not.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.550
It's not... a very firm ride.

09:49.550 --> 09:52.540
I don't like, a very firm ride.

09:52.540 --> 09:57.880
In fact, the only people who are gonna mind
the very firm ride are people with osteoporosis.

09:58.190 --> 10:02.820
And people who are old enough to have
osteoporosis will never buy a car...

10:02.820 --> 10:05.570
that has a steering wheel, like this.

10:05.570 --> 10:08.960
Especially, as it won't pick up Radio 2.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.330
The horror.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.330
I might have to listen to Radio 1.

10:18.500 --> 10:22.310
The radio and the ride though are
nothing compared to what happens when you...

10:22.310 --> 10:26.150
turn off a nice smooth A road like
this and head for somewhere like...

10:26.150 --> 10:28.900
Yugvukveyeye...

10:28.900 --> 10:32.800
On a bumpy, twisty road like this
one the differential causes the front...

10:32.800 --> 10:34.720
wheels to squirm and writhe.

10:34.940 --> 10:37.610
It's awful. It's like riding around on an...

10:37.610 --> 10:39.050
angry horse.

10:43.320 --> 10:45.810
That's not me making it duck and weave...

10:45.810 --> 10:47.810
it's doing it itself.

10:49.110 --> 10:53.830
Relax your grip or your concentration
for a second on a rural road...

10:53.830 --> 10:55.920
and you'll end up in a sheep.

10:57.600 --> 11:00.140
I used to have an Escort Cosworth.

11:00.140 --> 11:04.080
I'm a huge fan of RS Fords and I
respect what they've done with this...

11:04.080 --> 11:06.410
as a piece of engineering, it's brilliant.

11:06.580 --> 11:08.730
It's so good in fact that I'm gonna let...

11:08.730 --> 11:11.810
the cameraman take it back to the Top Gear bunker.

11:11.810 --> 11:12.720
And me...

11:13.390 --> 11:15.350
I'm gonna go... in the Subaru.

11:15.350 --> 11:18.710
Or as they say in Wales where,
of course, they're allergic to vowels...

11:18.820 --> 11:21.980
The Sbrrrrvvzzznnrrrgghh...

11:27.410 --> 11:28.230
What was wrong with it?

11:28.700 --> 11:30.230
I'll tell you what's wrong with it...

11:30.230 --> 11:32.230
is that the diff, okay?

11:32.230 --> 11:33.660
When you accelerate...

11:33.660 --> 11:35.120
say, to pull out to overtake someone...

11:35.120 --> 11:36.980
and you're going round a corner,
and you give it full throttle...

11:36.980 --> 11:37.320
Yeah.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.880
The diff just grabs the front wheels and you go...

11:39.880 --> 11:41.560
in whatever direction they're pointing.

11:41.560 --> 11:42.170
You're joking?

11:42.170 --> 11:43.460
No you have... no control.

11:43.460 --> 11:46.040
You just sit there and go, "Oh I have...
I'm not strong enough to turn this wheel."

11:46.040 --> 11:46.930
And then...

11:46.930 --> 11:49.450
If you run over a camber change or even a white line...

11:49.450 --> 11:50.960
it grabs the wheels and pulls you the other way.

11:50.960 --> 11:52.030
Super torque steer.

11:52.030 --> 11:54.420
yeah so you lift off, and it goes,
"Oh, I'm not doing that anymore."

11:54.420 --> 11:58.220
and you just wobble about, honestly...
If you had one of these, okay...

11:58.220 --> 12:00.350
and then someone said,"where
do you work," you'd have to say...

12:00.350 --> 12:01.710
well, wherever it takes me.

12:01.710 --> 12:04.160
Thing is, no dealers in the UK have got these as demos.

12:04.160 --> 12:06.380
So, if you're wanna buy one...
if you get into an RS, you know...

12:06.380 --> 12:07.870
"I wanna buy an RS Focus...

12:07.870 --> 12:09.980
but before I give you the money I wanna drive one."

12:09.980 --> 12:10.600
You can't.

12:10.600 --> 12:12.350
But I saw an ad the other day, someone was saying...

12:12.350 --> 12:15.660
buy an RS Focus, what 1,200,
something or... 1,200 quid off list.

12:16.420 --> 12:17.020
No?

12:17.020 --> 12:18.380
Obviously, this is a bad plan.

12:18.380 --> 12:20.530
Can't see that happening, it wouldn't
have been a Ford dealer for sure...

12:20.530 --> 12:22.880
because, touring the Ford dealers, their Fords sold to...

12:23.100 --> 12:24.800
March... April.

12:24.800 --> 12:27.490
That's probably a broker... and
to be honest that's probably a spoof ad.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.020
What we used to do all the time.

12:29.020 --> 12:29.450
Really?

12:29.450 --> 12:31.910
Yeah, advertise it when you
haven't got it. Phone will be red hot.

12:31.910 --> 12:32.900
All the while phoning...

12:32.340 --> 12:34.560
So he hasn't got any Focuses to sell.

12:34.560 --> 12:38.110
I can't comment on the specific
incident, but I'd be very surprised.

12:38.460 --> 12:41.410
So, how's it work, you phone up
and say,"I want the car," what's he gonna say?

12:41.410 --> 12:44.900
Oh, thanks very much for phoning,
yeah, let me take your name and number. I'm...

12:44.900 --> 12:46.790
very busy, I'll phone you back. Then they've got you...

12:46.790 --> 12:49.870
and then they'll phone you back...
Oh fellow with the RS... Okay, yeah okay...

12:49.870 --> 12:50.690
erm...

12:50.690 --> 12:54.250
Take your credit card deposit and then we'll...
phone you back with the sh... all this kinda stuff.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.180
Basically, all they want you to do is phone them.

12:56.180 --> 12:59.370
And then at that point, as it gets closer and
closer to the delivery, chances are they'll say...

12:59.370 --> 13:02.130
Oh, well actually we've got a
slight delay and that car's been put back...

13:02.130 --> 13:03.720
but I have got the option on another one...

13:03.720 --> 13:05.150
but it's gonna be closer to list price.

13:05.150 --> 13:07.470
You're not gonna lose the car for 1000 pounds are you?

13:07.470 --> 13:09.000
And that's it, you're suckered in.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.680
What are you gonna do, March/April, when they say...

13:10.680 --> 13:12.490
"we've got your new car, but it's list price."

13:12.490 --> 13:13.160
You take it.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.550
You take it, because if you go somewhere
else, you're at the back of the queue again.

13:19.710 --> 13:22.900
In the news this week, more news of Americans...

13:22.900 --> 13:24.790
becoming very, very gullible.

13:24.790 --> 13:26.770
This is a bit... worrying
actually, the prob... I'm gonna...

13:26.770 --> 13:28.070
quote direct from the press here...

13:28.070 --> 13:30.330
The popularity of television broadcasts...

13:30.330 --> 13:32.870
of live, high speed car chases...

13:32.870 --> 13:36.600
has led to a dramatic rise in criminals
trying to out race pursuing officers.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.990
This is Los Angeles. In other words...

13:39.050 --> 13:41.360
they're surprised... that when you put these guys...

13:41.360 --> 13:45.150
these guys stealing cars and
driving really fast on the telly...

13:45.150 --> 13:46.250
more people do it.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.400
No, you can buy a beeper...

13:48.400 --> 13:50.620
and it goes off when a chase is happening.

13:50.620 --> 13:51.090
Yeah.

13:51.310 --> 13:54.090
And he'll be, "what, there's one
on, I'll turn over and watch that."

13:54.090 --> 13:56.910
And the Americans are surprised
more people are stealing cars.

13:56.910 --> 13:59.820
To this, they've actually got
people... there are cases of offenders...

13:59.900 --> 14:01.110
waving to helicopters...

14:01.110 --> 14:03.440
filming the pursuit and attempting spectacular...

14:03.440 --> 14:04.230
"Get a load of this!"

14:05.140 --> 14:07.550
And the thing is of course, they've
got those big powerful police cars...

14:07.550 --> 14:09.400
they wouldn't work here... I don't think...

14:09.400 --> 14:10.650
cause it would be like your beeper going off...

14:10.650 --> 14:14.920
<i>There's a medium speed police chase... chap in an Astra.</i>

14:14.920 --> 14:16.790
But, anyway... other items in the news...

14:16.790 --> 14:18.540
Car news.

14:18.540 --> 14:19.700
Vauxhall...

14:23.920 --> 14:25.110
I love Vauxhall.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.190
The on I particularly like...

14:28.190 --> 14:29.870
is the Zafira.

14:29.870 --> 14:33.320
It's the sort of Astra sized
estate thing, with 7 seats and...

14:33.320 --> 14:34.740
fold the back seats into the boot.

14:34.740 --> 14:37.540
Well now, they've done it again,
with an even smaller one...

14:37.540 --> 14:39.650
It's called the Mer... iva.

14:39.650 --> 14:42.770
and unpronounceable meaningless name... there it is.

14:41.630 --> 14:42.770
That it?

14:42.770 --> 14:45.030
That's a Meriva. Only got 5 seats...

14:45.030 --> 14:47.660
but the ones in the back will fold into the floor...

14:47.660 --> 14:48.550
completely.

14:48.550 --> 14:49.770
Or you can take the middle one out.

14:49.770 --> 14:53.200
Oh there's some shots of it, look, from the
mo... motorshow which is happening at the NEC...

14:53.200 --> 14:55.270
Apparently serving up... lots of cars.

14:53.200 --> 14:55.270
In Birmingham.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.360
Look, they  just fold into the floor
and you can take the middle ones out.

14:57.360 --> 15:00.140
It's a fantastically clever piece of design. Vauxhall...

15:00.140 --> 15:02.870
hopeless at everything, but very good at seats.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.080
Well they are, they're really... I would...

15:06.080 --> 15:08.470
family cars, these are very good. Zafira and that...

15:08.470 --> 15:09.440
very, very good.

15:09.440 --> 15:11.290
Maybe they should just make a range of furniture...

15:11.290 --> 15:12.910
and forget the whole car thing.

15:13.190 --> 15:15.110
Because your seats could fold into your floor...

15:15.110 --> 15:17.280
In your living room... and you'd have loads of space.

15:15.730 --> 15:16.440
Exactly.

15:17.260 --> 15:19.970
And then if loads of people came
around you could fold them all out.

15:19.970 --> 15:22.060
That's a, it's a... no, it is, it's a very good idea...

15:19.970 --> 15:22.060
No mate, maybe we should...

15:22.060 --> 15:23.620
Vauxhall seating in your dining room.

15:23.620 --> 15:26.200
erm, I've got a ncie car coming up... Mazda...

15:26.670 --> 15:29.560
RX-8, which is going to be glorious, it's a rotary engine...

15:29.560 --> 15:32.100
which. of course means it's only a 1.3 and it develops...

15:32.100 --> 15:33.700
250 brake horsepower.

15:33.700 --> 15:35.550
Of course it's rot... yeah no... see...

15:35.550 --> 15:37.080
well it's... oh no, it's a Wankel thing, isn't it?

15:37.080 --> 15:38.010
It is.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.460
That's a Wankel thing.

15:40.710 --> 15:43.470
Just get the whole...

15:41.150 --> 15:43.470
There's nothing funny about Wankel.

15:43.470 --> 15:45.930
Wankel is cool. Says here...

15:46.700 --> 15:48.480
that, as a safety measure...

15:48.600 --> 15:50.640
a safety measure, the rear doors...

15:50.640 --> 15:54.180
Cause it's got these... these
rearwards opening doors. The rear doors...

15:54.180 --> 15:56.690
can only be opened when the front doors...

15:56.690 --> 15:58.080
are open.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.660
As a safety measure, which if you think about it...

16:00.660 --> 16:01.490
mmhmm...

16:01.490 --> 16:05.120
That's not a safety measure, that's
a really nasty design fault...

16:05.210 --> 16:06.320
And they've thought...

16:05.690 --> 16:07.950
Cause it's shiny side down in a ditch...

16:07.950 --> 16:10.430
you wanna open all the doors pretty quick.

16:11.110 --> 16:14.080
What I like is the optimism here,
in the press release it says...

16:14.080 --> 16:15.610
he's talking about the engine right?

16:15.610 --> 16:18.280
With a name derived from the word <i>genesis...</i>

16:18.280 --> 16:20.280
derived from, so not similar...

16:20.280 --> 16:22.040
They've called it the... Renesis.

16:24.370 --> 16:26.990
I know what we're gonna do,
start with A... uh, Aenisis?

16:26.990 --> 16:28.030
Benises...

16:28.570 --> 16:30.470
Could've started with a P, could've been bad...

16:30.610 --> 16:32.000
How'd they get it right?

16:32.000 --> 16:33.030
That close.

16:33.150 --> 16:34.720
The VW...

16:35.680 --> 16:36.540
Touareg...

16:36.540 --> 16:37.370
toua... tou...

16:37.370 --> 16:40.000
we did evolve a technique for actually saying it.

16:39.350 --> 16:40.020
Yeah... yeah...

16:40.600 --> 16:41.650
Touareg (muffled).

16:42.180 --> 16:45.690
How can you not know it's a...
it's a Saharan tribe of people.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.330
-Yeah.

16:46.030 --> 16:47.330
-The Touareg?

16:47.630 --> 16:49.100
I don't wanna say it, but that's what it is.

16:49.100 --> 16:51.490
It's the... Touareg.

16:52.230 --> 16:53.720
The Touare... i'll tell you what it is, it's a...

16:53.770 --> 16:55.420
Volk... it's a Porsche Cayenne...

16:55.420 --> 16:59.230
with the word Porsche crossed out
and Volkswagen written in, in crayon.

16:59.230 --> 17:01.970
The most amazing thing about that is the V10 diesel engine.

17:01.970 --> 17:02.340
Yeah.

17:02.540 --> 17:03.380
Oh, I've nodded off.

17:04.750 --> 17:07.839
Just lost the... diese... aughhhhhhhh...

17:07.839 --> 17:08.890
That's be fun...

17:08.890 --> 17:12.300
but it... you say the word diesel
and my seat goes into recline mode.

17:16.270 --> 17:16.800
Cause i'm...

17:16.530 --> 17:18.710
We're not gonna get the fixed again now, you need...

17:18.710 --> 17:21.859
Stop everything. At the NEC, this week...

17:22.660 --> 17:25.050
Actually stop everything, I'll
tell you what I saw this morning...

17:25.050 --> 17:25.390
Go on.

17:25.390 --> 17:28.020
Ready? I saw a bus...

17:28.020 --> 17:30.020
on the M4 bus lane.

17:30.020 --> 17:31.060
An actual bus?

17:31.620 --> 17:33.170
First time in 5 years...

17:33.170 --> 17:37.350
It was a bu... it was an airport bus taking some
stewardesses for a little light sex in London.

17:37.350 --> 17:38.120
But...

17:39.280 --> 17:40.700
it was a bus.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.300
How about...  it was... I can't... it's a bus!

17:41.350 --> 17:42.000
Splendid.

17:42.330 --> 17:46.180
You can see everyone crammed into those
two lanes, been there for 4 & 1/2 years...

17:46.180 --> 17:48.300
Finally one comes along...

17:47.430 --> 17:48.320
It's worth their money now...

17:48.320 --> 17:49.460
I mean it's... it's been used.

17:49.460 --> 17:51.150
Yes, exactly, a million quid that cost.

17:51.150 --> 17:54.450
Anyway, listen, the most important
thing of the week apart form the bus...

17:52.710 --> 17:53.170
Yes...

17:54.450 --> 17:57.680
is... MG, okay?

17:57.680 --> 18:01.440
They have got a new car, at the motorshow, this week...

18:01.440 --> 18:02.710
Here it is...

18:02.780 --> 18:05.810
God, it's smoking badly. Like an early MG.

18:05.810 --> 18:10.350
Anyway, this is it. Now I think
that is a fabulous looking car.

18:10.350 --> 18:12.350
I think it's desperately...

18:12.350 --> 18:13.370
desperately ugly.

18:13.370 --> 18:15.140
But hey, that's my view.

18:15.600 --> 18:18.040
You know those glasses you wear occasionally?

18:15.680 --> 18:16.140
It's...

18:18.620 --> 18:20.710
Where are you on this? Where are you on...

18:19.320 --> 18:20.090
No, i'm... it...

18:20.090 --> 18:21.900
Jeremy's there... there.

18:22.310 --> 18:23.780
That tall lanky fellow over there.

18:23.780 --> 18:25.150
Do you like it?

18:26.590 --> 18:28.680
I'd have to see it in the flesh, no, um...

18:27.930 --> 18:28.940
You see? you...

18:28.680 --> 18:30.450
there's too many grilles, look at it.

18:30.450 --> 18:32.790
That's like something designed
by a heating engineer, it is.

18:30.450 --> 18:31.370
That's the first...

18:32.790 --> 18:36.110
Except, anyway, it's a fantastic looking car.

18:33.970 --> 18:35.570
Looking plumb.

18:36.110 --> 18:38.590
It's a fantastic looking car...

18:38.590 --> 18:41.220
Let's have a show of hands,
where are we. Show of hands.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.220
Who think it's a fantastic looking car?

18:43.800 --> 18:46.510
Who thinks it's ugly and got
too many radiator grilles?

18:45.050 --> 18:45.820
Ah, yes.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.720
That's kind of a split Jeremy.

18:48.390 --> 18:49.370
That's 50/50.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.440
Anyway, okay, well I'm gonna bring them round.

18:51.440 --> 18:53.920
Would you like to know, about it's engines?

18:54.870 --> 18:55.780
Yes?

18:55.780 --> 18:58.130
Well it's got a Mustang V8 under there.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.400
Not, no, it's not a very good engine that.

19:00.400 --> 19:01.420
However...

19:01.580 --> 19:03.420
You can get one standard tune...

19:03.420 --> 19:05.580
and there's about 3 different levels of tune okay...

19:05.580 --> 19:08.110
you can get one... 410 horsepower.

19:08.110 --> 19:08.560
Well.

19:08.560 --> 19:10.560
That's plenty in store, yeah.

19:09.230 --> 19:12.990
65,000 pounds, 410, this is MG coming back.

19:12.990 --> 19:16.770
However... they are selling
a range of accessories...

19:16.770 --> 19:20.670
which will allow you to take that
power upto... anyone wanna guess?

19:21.820 --> 19:25.160
965 brake horsepower.

19:26.070 --> 19:29.430
That's 100 more than Michael
Schumacher has in his Ferrari.

19:29.430 --> 19:30.900
In an MG.

19:29.430 --> 19:30.900
In an MG.

19:30.900 --> 19:35.330
In an MG. This is astonishing.
Do you you what they've... I mean...

19:35.720 --> 19:37.720
What staggers me about that car...

19:37.720 --> 19:40.990
is they can't possibly, have designed it...

19:40.990 --> 19:43.360
in the time it's taken... since BMW left.

19:42.570 --> 19:43.230
No.

19:43.650 --> 19:45.920
They' must've... they must've had an underground...

19:43.360 --> 19:45.360
Now they had... they must've...

19:45.940 --> 19:48.340
production lie, that BMW, when they were running it...

19:48.340 --> 19:49.310
never knew about.

19:48.960 --> 19:49.310
Yeah.

19:49.730 --> 19:50.190
Yeah.

19:50.070 --> 19:52.070
Vat are ze doing in ze parade ground?

19:52.070 --> 19:53.330
I'll keep it quiet.

19:52.720 --> 19:55.460
I'm not doing anything mate, i'm just uh...

19:56.830 --> 19:59.280
This is something...  something near the houses.

19:58.230 --> 20:01.010
Vat is zis vaulting horse you haf here?

20:01.010 --> 20:01.890
Underneath...

20:01.370 --> 20:03.590
Have ve looked underneath ze stove?

20:04.670 --> 20:05.570
They had one there...

20:05.570 --> 20:08.140
and he was going to... just about
BMW leaving you know, the day...

20:08.140 --> 20:10.960
Ve haf tried and ve haf failed wiz you people...

20:10.960 --> 20:11.540
Turrah...

20:11.740 --> 20:14.880
Turrah mate... take car, be good, thanks for coming.

20:14.880 --> 20:19.400
Right, break out that V8, get the supercharger,
kick the nitrous, we'll get something...

20:19.400 --> 20:20.180
going here, let's...

20:20.180 --> 20:21.770
Time to get it started.

20:21.770 --> 20:24.120
They had that lot, al...
all those cars they've done...

20:24.120 --> 20:24.440
Must have.

20:24.440 --> 20:26.880
ZTs and the ZRs and the ZSs...

20:24.490 --> 20:25.050
Yeah...

20:25.440 --> 20:26.300
In secret.

20:26.900 --> 20:31.040
They had that lot, ready to go
as soon as BMW were out the door.

20:33.640 --> 20:34.480
Good on 'em.

20:34.550 --> 20:37.090
Right, erm... I feel the need for some science...

20:37.090 --> 20:38.340
coming on now, okay?

20:38.340 --> 20:41.380
Now, how many times in our lives
are we gonna have to watch some...

20:41.380 --> 20:45.190
insane loon, jumping over buses on a motorbike?

20:45.190 --> 20:46.460
you know the, off a ramp...

20:46.460 --> 20:50.320
It would be rather more interesting,
rather than jumping buses in a bike...

20:50.320 --> 20:51.330
big wow...

20:51.330 --> 20:54.580
to see how many bikes you can jump...

20:54.580 --> 20:55.960
with a bus. So we did.

20:56.800 --> 21:00.200
We must nearly all of us remember, in 1978...

21:00.200 --> 21:04.580
Eddie Kidd, legendary stunt motorcyclist
and the inspiration behind a million...

21:04.580 --> 21:07.360
scuffed elbows, and bent push bikes...

21:07.360 --> 21:09.340
jumped, 14 buses.

21:14.570 --> 21:16.320
But we wanted to do it differently.

21:16.320 --> 21:19.330
We wanted to see what would
happen if you jumped a bus...

21:19.330 --> 21:23.000
over 14 bikes. Now that would be something.

21:25.990 --> 21:28.620
14 bikes, that's about 30 feet.

21:30.770 --> 21:33.830
Okay, Eddie Kidd's jump was nearer 200 feet...

21:33.830 --> 21:36.390
but the, he wasn't doing it, in a bus.

21:40.490 --> 21:43.240
It's a 1970s Daimler Fleetline.

21:43.240 --> 21:47.420
11 liter engine, in cream
and green, the Ipswich livery.

21:47.420 --> 21:49.420
And it's...  a beauty.

21:54.060 --> 21:55.460
And that's... the set-up.

21:55.460 --> 21:58.910
We honestly have no idea, what's gonna happen.

21:58.910 --> 22:01.100
But then that's often the way with science.

22:01.100 --> 22:04.290
Sometimes you've just gotta have faith, in your ideas.

22:11.250 --> 22:14.870
Ahh, the joy of prolonging that...

22:15.340 --> 22:17.970
Ah, we're gonna do it, we're
gonna do it later on so...

22:17.970 --> 22:20.150
we'll put you out of your misery,
but I just thought, I mean...

22:20.150 --> 22:22.710
how many bikes do you reckon it actually cleared?

22:23.400 --> 22:24.350
I reckon...

22:24.350 --> 22:24.970
A million.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.970
A milli... no, I reckon...

22:27.400 --> 22:29.450
I don't know this actually, I reckon...

22:29.670 --> 22:30.080
5.

22:30.360 --> 22:32.380
5? Okay, let's have a look at a couple more...

22:32.380 --> 22:33.160
more suggestions?

22:34.300 --> 22:37.420
There were 14, you fool. Struggle...

22:35.290 --> 22:36.780
There were 14 there... pieces...

22:37.590 --> 22:39.680
Would he have went back and did
them again, that wouldn't count...

22:39.680 --> 22:42.810
Right, well, look, we will take your
bets over the next, you know, few moments...

22:38.560 --> 22:39.210
3.

22:42.790 --> 22:45.910
Write some down and... and you
could win a... uh, something...

22:45.910 --> 22:47.400
Packet of Werther's Originals.

22:47.400 --> 22:47.890
Nice.

22:47.890 --> 22:48.580
Yeah, it's okay.

22:49.120 --> 22:50.580
Now, this...

22:50.580 --> 22:54.460
down here, is the Noble M12 GTO.

22:54.460 --> 22:58.580
It's plastic body, is made in
South Africa, by a company that...

22:58.580 --> 23:00.950
makes plastic replicas of ACs...

23:00.950 --> 23:01.960
for the American market.

23:02.280 --> 23:03.870
It's then flown...

23:03.870 --> 23:05.790
in an aeroplane to Leicestershire...

23:05.790 --> 23:08.290
where it's taken to a shed, where a man...

23:08.290 --> 23:12.190
called Lee, fits it with a Mondeo engine.

23:12.190 --> 23:14.950
Not a particularly promising start then.

23:15.700 --> 23:16.950
But it's not a bad car.

23:17.880 --> 23:19.690
It's not a bad car at all.

23:34.270 --> 23:38.230
It's quite a dainty looking little
thing, but that huge wing on the back...

23:38.230 --> 23:40.600
suggests it's no fairy cake.

23:46.460 --> 23:49.050
It's... much the same story in here.

23:49.180 --> 23:51.400
It's very comfortable. Lovely ride.

23:51.400 --> 23:53.870
I've got tonnes of space, I've got air conditioning...

23:53.870 --> 23:56.310
steering wheel adjust, it's nicely trimmed.

23:56.310 --> 23:59.950
Look, they've even covered the roll cage in... Alcantara.

24:00.340 --> 24:01.520
But listen...

24:08.500 --> 24:10.550
Sounds like Darth Vader's in the boot.

24:13.330 --> 24:16.210
Where are the plans of the rebel base?

24:17.530 --> 24:18.990
Sister?

24:19.590 --> 24:22.650
Obi-Wan was wise to hide this from me.

24:25.370 --> 24:28.530
What an extraordinary noise.

24:29.890 --> 24:31.360
Ooh, I like that.

24:32.390 --> 24:34.950
Actually that's the sound of 2 turbos...

24:34.950 --> 24:37.840
which have been glued to
the Mondeo engine to give it...

24:37.840 --> 24:39.480
a bit more punch.

24:41.090 --> 24:42.620
A lot more actually.

24:42.620 --> 24:46.000
If you floor the throttle, there's a
bit of a pause while the turbos build up...

24:46.000 --> 24:47.060
and then...

24:49.320 --> 24:52.920
0-60, takes 4.4 seconds and then...

24:53.110 --> 24:58.430
it'll wheeze it's way to 165
miles an hour which it's doing now.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.850
This is a quick car.

25:03.580 --> 25:07.740
but actually it's not the power or
the looks which set the Noble apart...

25:08.560 --> 25:11.100
It's the way it goes round corners...

25:22.340 --> 25:25.640
You've probably heard people
prattling on about... the...

25:26.310 --> 25:29.370
Ferrari 355 or the Lotus Elise, well...

25:29.540 --> 25:32.450
probably heard me prattling
on about them actually but...

25:32.840 --> 25:34.580
this is in a different league.

25:35.050 --> 25:38.440
It doesn't feel like the steering
wheel is connected to the tyres by...

25:38.440 --> 25:42.140
anything, so mundane as mechanics or engineering.

25:43.330 --> 25:45.800
It's like driving... using the force.

25:47.070 --> 25:50.760
Use the force, Jeremy, use the force.

25:54.200 --> 25:58.340
And it absolutely, will not, understeer.

25:59.200 --> 26:01.940
There's just tonnes and tonnes and tonnes of grip...

26:01.940 --> 26:02.780
and then...

26:03.600 --> 26:05.000
when it does let go...

26:05.000 --> 26:07.730
it's the back, which just gently...

26:07.880 --> 26:08.830
calmly...

26:09.590 --> 26:11.090
steps out of line.

26:12.060 --> 26:13.720
You know, I've driven...

26:14.170 --> 26:16.440
some pretty good cars in my time...

26:16.590 --> 26:19.620
well to be perfectly honest, I've
driven every car in my time but...

26:20.250 --> 26:23.110
this, as far as handling is concerned...

26:23.110 --> 26:25.270
purely as a driver's car...

26:26.090 --> 26:27.470
I think it's my favourite.

26:27.940 --> 26:28.710
I really do.

26:35.440 --> 26:39.010
Listen to that soun... *laughter*

26:41.170 --> 26:43.660
I don't know another car like this.

26:43.920 --> 26:45.950
Just so love it.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.000
I shall go after Skywalker.

26:50.260 --> 26:52.320
Get me my Noble.

26:53.140 --> 26:56.400
It's better than stuff costing ten times as much...

26:56.650 --> 26:58.610
40,000 pounds?

27:01.930 --> 27:02.990
It's a bargain.

27:07.730 --> 27:09.820
Now you may have noticed
in that film just there that...

27:09.820 --> 27:12.100
the brakelights were flicking
on and off all the time...

27:12.100 --> 27:13.540
that wasn't me left foot braking...

27:13.540 --> 27:15.960
I don't know how to left
foot brake and if I tried...

27:15.960 --> 27:17.960
I'd crash. That's so... there's obviously a...

27:18.110 --> 27:19.170
loose connection.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.170
And there are some other things wrong
with it, look at this for instance...

27:21.170 --> 27:23.470
to open the front or the back you need a screwdriver.

27:23.470 --> 27:25.180
Then, we've got the window.

27:25.200 --> 27:27.650
That's Noble's idea, of down.

27:28.150 --> 27:30.520
And you should see it's turning circle.

27:30.630 --> 27:33.900
Right, this is a... the V
word, the double V word in fact...

27:33.900 --> 27:37.540
doing a u-turn, there we are,
that's how much space it needs.

27:37.540 --> 27:41.090
Here's the Noble, full lock. And...

27:41.090 --> 27:42.170
Oh Lord.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.470
that's not completely brilliant is it?

27:47.470 --> 27:49.470
You need Belgium to turn around in.

27:51.430 --> 27:53.650
Jeremy, stop it, thats dirty.

27:53.650 --> 27:55.650
It's also not very nice to look at actually.

27:53.630 --> 27:54.750
Sorry I...

27:55.700 --> 27:57.980
Seriously, apart from the turning circle which...

27:57.980 --> 27:59.980
is disastrous, is it really that good?

28:00.400 --> 28:02.210
mmm, yes. do we all like it?

28:02.570 --> 28:04.210
Everyone? Anyone not like it?

28:05.090 --> 28:07.500
Fair enough, so it's a fantastic car.

28:05.090 --> 28:07.500
Fair enough, so it's... it's that good.

28:07.500 --> 28:09.500
Well, every fast car that we test here is...

28:09.500 --> 28:11.830
gonna go round our test track and set a laptime...

28:11.830 --> 28:15.320
so we can evaluate them all against one
another and it's all fair so the Stig drives them.

28:15.320 --> 28:18.490
The times go up there on
our Power Car Laptime Board...

28:18.490 --> 28:20.130
so let's see what the Stig did with it.

28:22.070 --> 28:25.170
the problems of the British
weather, look at that track...

28:25.170 --> 28:28.770
it's absolutely soaking wet, but the Stig has no...

28:28.770 --> 28:31.950
fear at all as he heads on
down for that nasty little...

28:31.950 --> 28:35.270
jump just before the first corner,
really unsettles a bad chassis...

28:35.270 --> 28:37.450
but it won't unsettle that, believe me.

28:37.450 --> 28:40.660
Look at him, in he goes, how fast was that?
That was 100 miles an hour pretty much.

28:40.660 --> 28:44.600
not it wasn't... yes it was, it was almost
100 miles an hour through that first corner.

28:44.600 --> 28:47.640
Down to 60. Coming up through there...
this is gonna be tricky cause the...

28:47.640 --> 28:50.610
back's gonna go very, very light.

28:50.610 --> 28:52.610
Brakelights on, that doesn't mean anything...

28:52.610 --> 28:54.940
through there, look, not even...

28:55.500 --> 28:57.910
what is he listening to in there?

28:57.910 --> 28:59.080
Anyone catch that?

28:59.960 --> 29:01.340
Except the silence...

29:02.000 --> 29:03.710
And here we go, down the main straight, 97...

29:03.710 --> 29:04.120
100...

29:04.120 --> 29:04.740
102...

29:04.740 --> 29:05.540
105...

29:05.540 --> 29:08.600
that was a 105 miles an hour, let's remember the...

29:08.600 --> 29:12.260
Ford Focus earlier was only doing
99 and that was on a dry track.

29:12.260 --> 29:15.880
Right, through the Hammerhead, no need to worry
about understeer there, it doesn't do that...

29:15.880 --> 29:19.130
even when it's raining. And down
the main straight, brake hard...

29:19.130 --> 29:22.210
he's never gonna get through the
Follow Through flat out, is he?

29:22.210 --> 29:23.930
Is he? 94... no he's lifted.

29:23.930 --> 29:25.870
But he's... that's 100 miles an hour.

29:25.870 --> 29:28.460
That is seriously quick.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.400
That is so fast.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.780
This is going to be a fast
laptime even on a fast track.

29:36.920 --> 29:38.970
Now he's onto the main straight...

29:38.970 --> 29:41.710
And, what speed we gonna...
look at his speed... 106...

29:41.710 --> 29:43.280
That's 106 miles an hour.

29:43.470 --> 29:47.520
And the braking time, that's three times the
braking distance, as you turn into Baccarat Bend...

29:47.950 --> 29:49.700
He's gonna have to brake again for Carpenter's...

29:49.700 --> 29:52.330
Is he gonna get that tail out?
Is he gonna keep it nice a smooth?

29:52.330 --> 29:56.160
Maximum power, and across the line in 1...

29:56.160 --> 29:59.310
:32.90 on a wet track.

29:59.310 --> 30:02.110
Do you think it's brave,
The Stig or just a bit stupid?

30:02.110 --> 30:04.480
It's a racing driver, it doesn't understand fear.

30:04.480 --> 30:05.880
I really wouldn't do that.

30:05.880 --> 30:07.410
I just... I, I reckon...

30:07.410 --> 30:12.320
I'm gonna round that up cause... I'm gonna put it to 1:33 but
I'm gonna put a W cause it was  wet and then we'll remember.

30:12.320 --> 30:13.980
And you know, the extraordinary thing is...

30:13.980 --> 30:17.530
wet... and this is a 40,000 pound car, and the Zonda...

30:17.530 --> 30:20.520
that was... a 310,000 pound car.

30:20.520 --> 30:22.200
Quite an achievement...

30:20.520 --> 30:22.200
It's not at all bad...

30:22.200 --> 30:24.120
You know when the Zonda went around so quickly?

30:24.120 --> 30:25.910
1:23.

30:26.580 --> 30:27.780
And we did say...

30:27.780 --> 30:30.090
If you've got a car that you reckon can do it...

30:30.090 --> 30:31.770
quicker than that, contact us.

30:33.080 --> 30:35.730
We we're expecting some pretty exotic stuff...

30:36.080 --> 30:38.600
We've ha... we've had some
emails. Actually, we've had...

30:38.600 --> 30:39.070
thousands.

30:39.070 --> 30:41.830
Its... It makes us worry about
our audience, some of these.

30:41.830 --> 30:43.940
There's a guy here... on this email...

30:43.940 --> 30:46.250
who says he'll easily do it in his...

30:46.980 --> 30:48.250
Triumph Spitfire.

30:49.910 --> 30:53.810
It's 65 brake horsepower, might as
well try and do it in his tumble dryer...

30:55.060 --> 30:57.750
Another guy reckons he'll
smash the time, and that's...

30:57.750 --> 31:00.380
quoted directly from the email; smash the time...

31:00.380 --> 31:02.660
in his 911 turbo.

31:02.660 --> 31:04.660
I've got three words for you...

31:04.660 --> 31:05.700
no...

31:05.700 --> 31:06.580
you...

31:06.580 --> 31:07.270
won't.

31:13.090 --> 31:17.240
Let's talk about rockstars. Most of
them today wouldn't know a good car...

31:17.240 --> 31:19.680
if it offered to pleasure
them in the back of a limo.

31:19.680 --> 31:21.750
All they want really is to...

31:21.750 --> 31:25.240
get invited on Ant & Lard and
be picked up in a sponsored Citroen.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.250
They're pathetic.

31:26.550 --> 31:29.800
but, my guest tonight,
he's a proper rockstar...

31:29.800 --> 31:33.490
you gave him a car like
this, he'd probably lose it...

31:33.490 --> 31:35.230
or drive it into his moat.

31:35.230 --> 31:38.140
Ladies and gentleman...
Jamiroquai front man, Jay Kay!

31:45.890 --> 31:47.660
-How are you?

31:45.890 --> 31:47.660
-I'm very well.

31:47.660 --> 31:49.060
Have a seat.

31:49.250 --> 31:50.310
Thank you.

31:51.260 --> 31:53.820
Actually, you are quite a car fan aren't you?

31:53.820 --> 31:54.830
Just a bit.

31:55.260 --> 31:56.020
Really, serious...

31:56.020 --> 31:57.760
Cause we were going through
the office the other day...

31:56.020 --> 31:56.360
Yeah...

31:57.760 --> 32:00.390
and I was working on my perfect
garage and it would have...

32:00.390 --> 32:01.730
a Mercedes Pullman...

32:02.440 --> 32:04.120
Ferrari 550...

32:04.480 --> 32:06.210
Lamborghini Miura...

32:06.270 --> 32:06.880
SV.

32:06.880 --> 32:07.440
SV.

32:07.440 --> 32:07.870
Of course.

32:07.870 --> 32:08.920
Have you got any of those?

32:08.920 --> 32:09.310
Yeah...

32:10.280 --> 32:10.930
all of them.

32:12.650 --> 32:13.770
And what else?

32:13.770 --> 32:16.550
erm... There's a, a 360
Spider, which is outside...

32:16.550 --> 32:17.710
DB5...

32:18.770 --> 32:20.710
Concourse 2002 Turbo...

32:20.710 --> 32:21.870
'74... or something...

32:21.870 --> 32:23.530
That one actually interests me...

32:23.530 --> 32:24.260
The little Tur...

32:23.590 --> 32:25.490
Why have you got a 2002?

32:24.840 --> 32:25.440
I call it...

32:25.490 --> 32:28.200
And because it's the...
I've always had 2002s...

32:28.200 --> 32:30.440
Tired of... my first car
was a 1602, which is...

32:30.440 --> 32:31.480
a little underpowered job.

32:31.480 --> 32:32.810
What, your very first ever car?

32:32.250 --> 32:33.610
My very ever first car which I...

32:33.610 --> 32:35.610
bought off on a... two old ladies...

32:35.720 --> 32:38.540
with some letters with it that
said, "We did 1500 miles in it...

32:38.540 --> 32:40.010
this year."

32:40.010 --> 32:42.010
I'm gonna do 1500 miles a week, you know...

32:42.010 --> 32:44.270
And, uh, that was a '72
car, it had all the original...

32:44.270 --> 32:47.350
stickers and everything, and
uh, then I went up to TIs to...

32:47.350 --> 32:49.870
Touring International, Touring
Injection Internationals...

32:49.870 --> 32:52.180
then I had a dog of a Turbo,
cause some of them are real dogs...

32:52.180 --> 32:55.320
and it did for about 15... 1572 of them.

32:55.320 --> 32:58.980
And now I've... I've got a Concours, ex-BMW Car Club winner...

32:58.980 --> 32:59.910
A really good one?

32:59.910 --> 33:02.520
Cause weren't you more of a fan of the 3 liter...

32:59.910 --> 33:00.880
A really, really...

33:02.500 --> 33:03.960
CSLs?

33:03.960 --> 33:05.990
I used to have an original Batmobile, yeah.

33:05.990 --> 33:07.280
Oh, really? A 3.2?

33:07.280 --> 33:08.810
I had a 3.2 CSL yeah.

33:08.810 --> 33:11.890
See, how boring can we get on numbers here?

33:10.510 --> 33:11.850
Yeah, yeah...

33:11.910 --> 33:14.000
Where did it all come from, your love of cars?

33:14.000 --> 33:17.020
Umm, I, uh... my mum had a...

33:17.400 --> 33:19.640
a Triumph Herald 1360...

33:19.640 --> 33:20.680
convertible.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.680
Best turning circle...

33:23.560 --> 33:24.580
of any car.

33:25.740 --> 33:26.450
Umm, but...

33:26.130 --> 33:27.660
Well that was something in it's favour.

33:27.660 --> 33:30.130
Yeah, no, it was um... it was... I just spent...

33:30.130 --> 33:32.480
most... I spent all my life on the road...

33:32.480 --> 33:35.220
and... and you know when you're in
the back, I mean, in those days...

33:35.220 --> 33:37.930
they didn't really, you know...
not everything had a motor in it.

33:39.070 --> 33:42.110
And, erm... you know... and I...
I spent my whole time in the back of the car...

33:42.110 --> 33:44.610
and just looking out of the car... I mean,
I knew every car on the road, you know?

33:44.610 --> 33:45.580
This is when you were a kid?

33:45.580 --> 33:47.260
that was when I was tiny, you know what I mean, I was about...

33:46.510 --> 33:47.370
Oh, really?

33:47.370 --> 33:49.590
4 and 5, I knew every car on the road, everything.

33:49.910 --> 33:52.020
I mean now, I don't know anything cause they all look the same.

33:49.590 --> 33:51.830
Cause your mum was in entertainment...

33:51.960 --> 33:53.490
Your mum was an entertainer as well, wasn't she?

33:53.050 --> 33:53.720
Yeah, yeah...

33:53.720 --> 33:56.010
my mum was a singer, so it was a lot of miles, all the time...

33:56.010 --> 33:58.180
Anyway, listen we've got a little game...

33:58.180 --> 33:59.130
Yes?

33:59.560 --> 34:01.780
I haven't seen this, so... cause
I'm gonna play it with you...

34:01.780 --> 34:04.840
we've go... cause I was, I could
say Maserati before I could say mummy...

34:05.050 --> 34:06.840
but we're gonna put some pictures of...

34:05.050 --> 34:05.610
Right.

34:06.840 --> 34:08.520
bits of cars on the screen, we'll...

34:07.900 --> 34:09.360
Oh, I like these games...

34:08.560 --> 34:10.929
see, and you all join in okay?

34:10.010 --> 34:10.929
I love these games.

34:10.929 --> 34:13.670
We'll see if we can see what sort of car it is.

34:13.670 --> 34:15.670
Cause I'm such a sucker for this, I sit and watch...

34:15.670 --> 34:18.449
old 70s movies like The Sweeney got... ooh look...

34:18.840 --> 34:20.949
Okay then, here's one for you... what's that?

34:20.949 --> 34:22.780
That's part of a Ferrari Enzo.

34:22.780 --> 34:24.870
It is, it's the rear wing on a Ferrari Enzo.

34:24.870 --> 34:26.870
Are we right? Yes?

34:27.670 --> 34:28.600
I thank you.

34:29.480 --> 34:30.969
Yes, he can speak.

34:31.739 --> 34:34.070
Ferrari Enzo, yeah, all right, 1:0 to you...

34:34.070 --> 34:35.469
go on then, second one...

34:34.480 --> 34:37.170
co... coming... coming soon, at a highway near you.

34:37.170 --> 34:38.179
I've gotta have it.

34:38.179 --> 34:39.540
Anything g... why?

34:39.540 --> 34:40.380
Why?

34:40.380 --> 34:41.290
It's not a pretty car.

34:41.290 --> 34:43.830
It's a... stunning looking thing.

34:44.040 --> 34:47.429
You know why? I mean... because, because that's...

34:47.429 --> 34:49.690
and there's gonna come the day
they won't make cars like that anymore.

34:49.690 --> 34:51.840
so let's not even go there, let's look at the next one...

34:50.810 --> 34:51.630
Okay...

34:51.860 --> 34:53.630
What is it?

34:54.300 --> 34:55.630
Z...

34:56.469 --> 34:57.810
It's a Mini, the new Mini.

34:58.130 --> 34:59.380
If that is...

35:00.180 --> 35:02.140
He's so good at this.

35:04.360 --> 35:05.370
Thank you.

35:06.060 --> 35:07.980
I told you I like this game.

35:07.980 --> 35:09.550
Fantastic... I'm staggere... no, no...

35:07.980 --> 35:09.550
You didn't believe me did you?

35:10.000 --> 35:12.330
Do you know something really funny? Absolutely true.

35:12.330 --> 35:14.200
We didn't tell you we were gonna do this...

35:14.200 --> 35:15.280
This is not prepared.

35:14.220 --> 35:15.750
No, no...

35:15.340 --> 35:16.550
I didn't know we were gonna do this.

35:16.550 --> 35:18.550
come on, let's have another one...

35:19.460 --> 35:20.710
Well, that could be lots of things.

35:20.710 --> 35:21.810
It's a Golf.

35:21.810 --> 35:22.600
Oh my word.

35:22.600 --> 35:23.830
Actually that's not a Golf.

35:23.830 --> 35:25.060
It's not a Golf.

35:25.770 --> 35:26.650
What is it?

35:27.600 --> 35:28.180
A what?

35:29.880 --> 35:32.150
If that's a Vectra... oh, I said the word.

35:34.860 --> 35:38.110
Oh I... still don't know. It is, it's a Vectra.

35:39.150 --> 35:40.610
That is a phenomenon...

35:40.610 --> 35:42.590
It's a phenomenon... yeah, yeah...

35:40.610 --> 35:42.590
Ladies and gentle...

35:43.220 --> 35:44.270
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:44.040 --> 35:44.860
Ladies and gentlemen...

35:44.860 --> 35:47.160
I believe this car is a phenomenon.

35:46.110 --> 35:47.160
Phenomenon.

35:47.290 --> 35:50.050
Yeah, it's... it's not really a phenomenon is it?

35:50.130 --> 35:51.230
It's rubbish.

35:51.230 --> 35:51.680
It's...

35:54.380 --> 35:56.940
Not as bad as the other one, it's just... rubbish.

35:56.940 --> 36:00.320
Anyway, last one and I'm on nought, which means we will be swapping jobs...

36:00.650 --> 36:02.320
that means we swap cars...

36:02.780 --> 36:05.750
houses, and, have your... Enzo.

36:06.510 --> 36:07.560
And have the Enzo.

36:07.240 --> 36:08.750
And have your house with a moat.

36:08.750 --> 36:12.240
And the moat, which you, too,
can drive your G-Wagen into.

36:12.240 --> 36:14.520
Have you driven a car... you
have driven a car into a moat.

36:14.520 --> 36:16.200
I did yeah, I got it in there...

36:15.640 --> 36:16.220
Oh...

36:16.220 --> 36:17.880
this is fantastic.

36:17.880 --> 36:18.500
Well done.

36:18.500 --> 36:21.330
I came round the corner in the
G-Wagen and I said to the...

36:21.330 --> 36:24.100
two guys I was taking round the
land, it was 80 acres, you know...

36:24.100 --> 36:26.450
and I got... I started off really
nicely and I said, you wanna...

36:26.450 --> 36:28.390
have a go? And he said, "no it's
all right, you know the land."

36:28.390 --> 36:31.490
I mean, famous last words...
<i>You know the land, so I'll let you do it.</i>

36:31.490 --> 36:32.980
Came out of the corner at 60...

36:33.070 --> 36:37.160
G-Wagen, a big old... thumping great, vermacht G500...

36:37.160 --> 36:39.160
and I look, i'm doing 60... oh, oh, oh dear...

36:39.160 --> 36:40.650
oh, understeer, oh, oh, oh...

36:40.650 --> 36:42.610
oh, look, bank, oh river, oh...

36:40.930 --> 36:41.680
Splotch...

36:46.180 --> 36:48.920
And the guy looked round at me, just went...

36:49.480 --> 36:50.360
What you doin'?

36:52.430 --> 36:55.680
And then I looked round again, and then
the other one in the back, big builder went...

36:55.680 --> 36:56.870
we're sinkin'.

36:57.840 --> 37:01.070
And that was that, and you know
what I mean... it was like...

37:01.070 --> 37:03.070
Let's have a look at this picture.

37:03.630 --> 37:05.070
That's just a black hole.

37:05.720 --> 37:06.690
What's that?

37:06.690 --> 37:07.730
What's that there?

37:07.730 --> 37:09.340
I don't know, I'm trying to work this out, can we ju...

37:09.340 --> 37:10.830
Does anyone here...

37:10.830 --> 37:13.410
You know, this is Top Gear, have
you all come to a gardening program?

37:13.410 --> 37:14.790
What is it?

37:14.790 --> 37:16.210
Well, what's that?

37:15.220 --> 37:16.750
Anyone got an id... what?

37:17.830 --> 37:19.400
What, Lamborghini what?

37:20.310 --> 37:22.460
Murcielago, I was gonna say that... did cross my mind.

37:22.460 --> 37:24.460
It's something to do with the vents that come up, isn't it?

37:24.460 --> 37:26.750
What, the slidey things? Can you pull back? Let's have a look.

37:26.750 --> 37:28.710
Oh, no. Right, yeah, yeah, yeah...

37:28.710 --> 37:30.470
clea... clear as day, there's that little...

37:30.470 --> 37:32.800
there you go, there it is, Murcielago, yeah...

37:31.080 --> 37:32.370
Clear as day what?

37:32.800 --> 37:34.200
Oh, God, oh...

37:34.930 --> 37:37.780
I tell you what though, he did well with the little square... like that...

37:37.030 --> 37:40.670
He did, that was... I'd have to buy that, great car that...

37:39.650 --> 37:41.300
Don't show us up next time, yeah?

37:41.670 --> 37:43.620
Well done you, Have you driven one?

37:43.620 --> 37:45.040
No, I haven't yet...

37:45.040 --> 37:47.040
Cause you are a fairly wicked driver...

37:47.040 --> 37:49.890
You know, because of the, the...
the work, you know... the type of...

37:49.890 --> 37:52.390
job I do, which I wanna get
rid of and swap for this one now.

37:52.390 --> 37:54.150
I'm gonna swap it for your job.

37:54.150 --> 37:56.520
Anytime, I'll swap with you...

37:54.180 --> 37:56.540
Erm, er, yeah... a bit...

37:56.540 --> 37:59.130
You wouldn't like it, I can assure you.

37:56.540 --> 37:59.130
anytime.

37:58.380 --> 38:00.300
No... your fans wouldn't like it.

38:00.050 --> 38:02.230
No, no, yes... no, they wouldn't like it.

38:05.850 --> 38:07.570
Who's that croaking?

38:07.070 --> 38:07.520
Exactly.

38:07.520 --> 38:10.780
Erm, no, um, you know... I don't get...

38:10.780 --> 38:14.200
as much track time as, as... as
I'd like to and you know, and I mean...

38:14.200 --> 38:16.200
What's the fastest you've ever been then?

38:16.740 --> 38:19.610
Everytime i'd surge cause everybody
thinks I'm just some thug on the road, but...

38:19.610 --> 38:22.840
I did do Rome to Calais in 13 hours and hit 190.

38:22.840 --> 38:24.820
Which was, uh, definitely...

38:24.820 --> 38:26.130
That's really good actually.

38:26.130 --> 38:27.770
Did the mental ma... arithmetic there.

38:27.020 --> 38:27.630
Yeah...

38:27.630 --> 38:29.240
Rome to Calais, 13 hours, yeah...

38:28.300 --> 38:29.550
That's really proper fast.

38:29.270 --> 38:32.140
The needle, the needle didn't drop below 140, really.

38:32.140 --> 38:33.590
Even in the petrol stations?

38:33.590 --> 38:35.210
Er, yeah...

38:34.230 --> 38:36.540
That's just... I presume that this is in...

38:36.600 --> 38:37.070
a few?

38:37.070 --> 38:38.690
I visited a few, yeah, well it's a...

38:38.690 --> 38:40.080
it's always that balanced isn't it?

38:40.080 --> 38:42.080
Do I go a bit slower and not visit so many?

38:41.750 --> 38:43.420
No, go faster cause...

38:42.110 --> 38:45.090
I mean you wonder why that bloke
in the Morris Minor is ahead of you still...

38:46.120 --> 38:49.020
You know, because the other thing is
that every petrol station you stop in Europe...

38:49.020 --> 38:50.580
you go, "Ooh I'll have that cuddly toy and...

38:50.580 --> 38:53.200
there's an in... there's an interesting
interior light thing on a thing...

38:53.200 --> 38:54.900
and I'll have... one of those
and even though I've got ten...

38:54.900 --> 38:57.270
of them at home and something to
stick on the window and all this...

38:57.270 --> 38:57.880
rubbish."

38:57.880 --> 38:59.490
Anyway, of course, as you know...

38:59.490 --> 38:59.880
Yeah...

38:59.880 --> 39:03.030
Yoou haven't just come down here
to chat and play silly kids' games.

39:03.030 --> 39:03.670
No.

39:03.670 --> 39:08.020
Reason, that we have a celebrity
guest every week is so that they go out...

39:08.180 --> 39:11.330
and play... Star in a Reasonably Price Car. They drive...

39:11.330 --> 39:13.980
round our track, in our Suzuki Liana.

39:13.980 --> 39:15.790
Now, you did that earlier today yes?

39:15.790 --> 39:16.600
I did.

39:16.600 --> 39:19.050
There's actually something quite
funny about Harry Enfield here last week...

39:19.050 --> 39:21.050
he drove the car in standard tune.

39:21.220 --> 39:23.780
Heard it was Jay Kay, we put a rollcage in it.

39:24.450 --> 39:26.680
We're gonna be seeing later on...

39:26.680 --> 39:28.100
how you did.

39:26.680 --> 39:28.100
Yes, okay.

39:28.100 --> 39:30.100
Actually, have you driven the RS Focus?

39:30.720 --> 39:34.230
I have. I was... I was given one just last week yes.

39:34.230 --> 39:35.700
Did you... like it?

39:36.210 --> 39:37.150
I...

39:37.820 --> 39:40.690
can't say I did like it much... no.

39:39.990 --> 39:41.220
-Really?

39:40.750 --> 39:41.300
-No.

39:41.300 --> 39:42.720
I... I found...

39:41.300 --> 39:42.720
What, you found all that...

39:42.970 --> 39:45.620
Oh, yeah, I mean... it was like... oh oh... there it goes.

39:45.620 --> 39:46.600
oh there it goes again.

39:45.680 --> 39:47.820
It is... absolutely terrifying.

39:47.040 --> 39:50.410
Yeah, it's, it's, it's... it's
quite, I, I, I... you know, I mean...

39:50.470 --> 39:52.410
Nicely put together, nice, nicely...

39:51.530 --> 39:52.080
Yeah.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.080
Looks nice on the way out.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.080
The thing is though...

39:54.390 --> 39:57.260
it's RSs. We're gonna get on and talk a bit more on RSs...

39:57.260 --> 39:59.770
we were talking about them earlier, because what interests me...

40:00.050 --> 40:02.810
by putting those engines, in like normal family...

40:02.810 --> 40:04.900
cars, it was like when Marks & Spencer...

40:04.900 --> 40:08.570
started selling pumpkin & ricotta soup.
You could go in there and think...

40:08.740 --> 40:11.110
<i>I can afford this exotic food...</i>

40:11.110 --> 40:14.760
That's great, I can do it... and that's
what it was like with RSs. If you think about it...

40:14.760 --> 40:16.760
whenever a TV producer...

40:16.760 --> 40:20.520
wants to sort of portray his
detective as soft and gentle like...

40:20.580 --> 40:23.950
Bergerac gets that old Triumph and Morse gets the Jag...

40:23.950 --> 40:26.320
but then when he wants him to be a hard, gritty...

40:26.320 --> 40:27.540
you know, tough guy...

40:27.210 --> 40:29.910
Professionals type, he sticks them in a RS2000.

40:28.010 --> 40:29.880
Yeah, you get the Professionals...

40:29.880 --> 40:31.520
and you get Spender.

40:37.570 --> 40:39.520
The thing about the Professionals is...

40:39.830 --> 40:43.750
That I... I still need to, even now, however
many years down the line, it still has an effect...

40:43.750 --> 40:46.620
if you put someone in an RS Ford...

40:47.120 --> 40:48.460
horns, grow out of the...

40:48.460 --> 40:51.330
Look, I'll tell you what happened okay?
All these RS people, they came down here...

40:51.380 --> 40:54.480
this morning, we said... Oh you can
have a drive round the track if you like.

40:54.590 --> 40:57.230
This is their idea, of a drive round the track.

41:04.230 --> 41:05.950
Look at this, watch this...

41:05.950 --> 41:07.790
is he going to drive through here... quietly?

41:07.790 --> 41:10.800
Nope, nope, nope, not... even managed to squeal.

41:12.080 --> 41:14.750
It's more funny how, we never said drive fast...

41:14.750 --> 41:16.200
we said,we just wanna get some shots...

41:14.750 --> 41:15.140
No.

41:16.200 --> 41:18.040
this is their idea of normal driving.

41:15.530 --> 41:17.180
No, just... drive round.

41:17.510 --> 41:17.870
Yeah.

41:17.870 --> 41:18.650
That's severe.

41:18.650 --> 41:20.650
Look at that, look at that.

41:23.420 --> 41:25.980
Excuse me, is... this is your Capri isn't it?

41:25.980 --> 41:28.710
Yeah, you're... you're wanted on the phone.

41:28.990 --> 41:30.710
Yeah, it's just over there... just...

41:31.360 --> 41:32.330
Alright thanks.

41:35.200 --> 41:37.370
I've never driven one, never driven one..

41:37.790 --> 41:39.910
Jeremy, that's the man's car.

41:40.050 --> 41:41.520
He's looking for the phone.

41:52.160 --> 41:56.010
Of course, Jeremy, you didn't
drive, this, the RS200, did you?

41:56.010 --> 41:57.340
No, I didn't, no.

41:57.340 --> 42:00.850
Probably just as well for it really, cause
they're quite rare and you have driven one...

42:01.860 --> 42:04.610
I did in the summer actually, I...
for a video I was making, I did.

42:04.030 --> 42:04.590
Yeah.

42:04.720 --> 42:06.590
Didn't go so well, did it, Jeremy?

42:06.840 --> 42:08.850
Do you like to have a look? I think we should.

42:09.350 --> 42:10.410
Let's have a look.

42:11.380 --> 42:15.280
The RS200 was always a tricky car to drive...

42:16.030 --> 42:18.540
It's never really...

42:18.540 --> 42:20.820
fells like it... you're in control...

42:23.250 --> 42:25.090
Here comes the power, here it...

42:25.360 --> 42:26.950
wow, that's...

42:40.240 --> 42:40.930
Don't...

42:45.110 --> 42:46.390
You can't clap him.

42:46.390 --> 42:48.460
You can't clap him for that...

42:48.460 --> 42:49.600
It's a secret...

42:49.600 --> 42:52.270
thing where I've been humiliated by Jay Kay...

42:51.050 --> 42:51.940
Jeremy, how...

42:52.330 --> 42:56.340
now you've humiliated m...

42:53.470 --> 42:56.280
And how long after setting off did you do that Jeremy?

42:56.510 --> 42:57.230
Not long.

42:57.230 --> 42:58.460
No, his first corner wasn't it?

42:58.460 --> 43:00.100
It... it was the first corner.

43:00.100 --> 43:00.850
And you broke it.

43:00.850 --> 43:03.640
I did brake it. Anyway, gonna move on now...

43:03.640 --> 43:05.640
okay? We're gonna humiliate some other people.

43:06.280 --> 43:08.180
When we were putting this series together...

43:08.180 --> 43:10.710
we were looking for new prese...
God knows how we ended up you...

43:10.710 --> 43:12.300
actually, but we were looking
for a lot of new presenters.

43:12.300 --> 43:14.050
People sent their tapes in right?

43:14.050 --> 43:16.000
Now this one is from a chap called Gaz...

43:16.000 --> 43:19.010
okay? Let's show you what Gaz's tape looked like.

43:19.150 --> 43:21.770
<i>Hello and welcome to... Gaz on Motors...</i>

43:21.770 --> 43:23.380
Today, we're gonna be looking at...

43:23.380 --> 43:24.720
instrumentation.

43:24.720 --> 43:26.090
Speedos in particular...

43:26.090 --> 43:28.090
You can tell this is...

43:26.590 --> 43:28.180
Oh he's still going on...

43:28.180 --> 43:39.230
<i>*Technical talk*</i>

43:40.740 --> 43:44.110
Gaz was heroically dull, wasn't he?

43:44.410 --> 43:47.170
So, you see, you just got the job, but it was close.

43:47.170 --> 43:49.620
But, do you know someone who's more boring than that?

43:49.620 --> 43:51.620
hm? Because, if you do...

43:51.620 --> 43:53.110
why don't you drop us a line?

43:53.110 --> 43:56.920
We are looking for the biggest car bore, in Britain.

43:57.090 --> 43:59.320
And the address is... what shall we have?

43:59.320 --> 44:02.630
I know a car bore and I've enclosed his name...

44:02.630 --> 44:04.630
Top Gear, BBC...

44:04.800 --> 44:07.060
London W12 7TS.

44:07.060 --> 44:08.900
Or, if you live near an internet...

44:08.900 --> 44:10.630
you could contact us on that. Or...

44:10.630 --> 44:14.500
if you've got one of those
wireless telephones, text message us.

44:18.590 --> 44:21.460
This week's insider dealings, got a
couple of real bargains for you...

44:21.460 --> 44:22.270
What are they?

44:22.270 --> 44:25.330
Ah, well, last week's cheap
Citroens, we got another one for you.

44:25.420 --> 44:28.010
erm... C5, not a bad car...

44:28.010 --> 44:30.850
but it's up against a lot of really good ones.

44:30.850 --> 44:31.740
And, erm... the...

44:31.740 --> 44:33.080
It is quite a bad car.

44:33.080 --> 44:34.130
It's not that bad.

44:34.130 --> 44:35.470
It's not, it's great spec...

44:35.470 --> 44:38.620
Well, it's like treading in long dirt,
it's not as bad as having your legged chopped off...

44:38.620 --> 44:40.620
but it's still pretty unpleasant.

44:40.620 --> 44:43.970
Okay, well the base model, the
petrol base model, just isn't selling...

44:44.020 --> 44:46.780
the car's about 14,500 new, retail...

44:46.780 --> 44:48.780
I was offered one, this week, brand new...

44:48.780 --> 44:49.790
for 10,000.

44:49.790 --> 44:50.850
10,000 quid?

44:50.850 --> 44:51.770
Yeah, 10,000...

44:51.770 --> 44:54.240
1.8, you got air-con, you got CD...

44:54.240 --> 44:57.000
electric windows, power steering, trick suspension...

44:57.140 --> 44:58.340
for 10,000.

44:58.400 --> 44:59.900
Rover 75?

44:59.900 --> 45:02.410
Not a bad car, probably the best
Rover they've made for a number of years.

45:02.410 --> 45:03.660
Not much competition.

45:03.660 --> 45:05.440
Not much competition.

45:05.440 --> 45:08.090
2.0 liter V6, good engine. But they've just dropped it...

45:08.090 --> 45:10.090
they're replacing it with a 1.8 turbo...

45:10.090 --> 45:13.350
it's a little bit more... efficient
on fuel, lower emissions and so forth...

45:13.520 --> 45:17.480
what it does mean is dealers for 2.0
liter V6s are out there doing a deal.

45:17.780 --> 45:21.490
So, if you want a cheap Rover 75,
and you can find a 2.0 liter V6...

45:21.490 --> 45:22.540
you're gonna get a bargain.

45:22.540 --> 45:23.800
How much of a bargain?

45:23.800 --> 45:25.470
Talk to your dealer. There's no official figures...

45:25.470 --> 45:27.170
but they will do a deal, guaranteed.

45:26.860 --> 45:27.640
Big deals?

45:27.640 --> 45:28.560
Big deals.

45:28.560 --> 45:29.010
Oh, nice.

45:29.010 --> 45:33.520
erm... Used car bargain. If anybody here
fancies a supermini, now is the time to buy one...

45:33.520 --> 45:36.190
erm... things like, Citroen Saxos...

45:36.190 --> 45:38.760
Fiat Seicentos, all the kind of small stuff...

45:38.760 --> 45:40.760
and there's a very good reason for it.

45:40.760 --> 45:42.760
Because this is the time of the year that the dealers...

45:42.760 --> 45:46.050
change their courtesy cars, their loan cars; the kind
of thing you get when your cars are in for a service...

45:46.360 --> 45:48.730
and they tend to run superminis, they're normally...

45:48.890 --> 45:50.180
Why do they change them at this time of the year?

45:50.180 --> 45:53.240
Well, it's a good... good reason for it, they build those cars...

45:53.240 --> 45:55.410
in Europe, most of them are built in Europe, and in...

45:55.410 --> 45:57.720
July and August, they shut the factory and retool...

45:57.720 --> 45:58.110
Yeah.

45:58.110 --> 46:00.820
erm... to prepare for the new models, next year models.

46:00.820 --> 46:01.320
Yeah.

46:01.760 --> 46:04.520
This is the time of year the new models hit the UK...

46:04.520 --> 46:06.330
so basically what they're doing is chang...

46:05.720 --> 46:07.200
So, they bought them a year ago...

46:07.200 --> 46:07.590
Yeah.

46:07.590 --> 46:08.700
now they're flogging them on.

46:08.700 --> 46:10.370
Yeah, flogging them on. They'll... they'll be base cars...

46:10.370 --> 46:12.570
3 doors, non metallics and that kind of thing...

46:12.570 --> 46:15.520
but, you can get a 12... 12 month old car for 4,000.

46:16.080 --> 46:17.520
4,000.

46:17.810 --> 46:18.250
Four?

46:17.700 --> 46:19.120
That's seriously cheap.

46:19.140 --> 46:20.250
That is cheap actually.

46:19.760 --> 46:20.510
Yeah.

46:20.590 --> 46:23.740
erm... Another used car bargain...
we got a... erm... BMW 7 series...

46:23.740 --> 46:25.910
do you know what the new one's like? Pretty ugly?

46:26.140 --> 46:29.700
erm... New sales of that are
not good, but the impact of that...

46:29.700 --> 46:32.240
the new ones made the old one look really, really old...

46:32.240 --> 46:33.350
really old fashioned.

46:33.350 --> 46:35.350
So the prices are dropping big style.

46:35.350 --> 46:35.830
Really?

46:35.830 --> 46:37.830
Really, really dropping, massively.

46:37.830 --> 46:40.370
If you've got one, it's bad news,
cause it's gonna be worth peanuts...

46:40.370 --> 46:41.930
but if you wanna go and buy one, it's great news.

46:41.930 --> 46:44.940
Give you a little example, this is
a car that was offered this week, 728i...

46:44.940 --> 46:47.750
with a bit of spec on it, 2001 on a Y, so that car's...

46:47.750 --> 46:49.030
18 months old.

46:49.030 --> 46:51.870
The guy paid nearly 46,000 for it new.

46:51.980 --> 46:55.190
Today, selling that car without
doing a deal, without even negotiating...

46:55.190 --> 46:56.520
he'll take 24,000 for it.

46:56.800 --> 46:58.860
It's a half price car.

46:58.860 --> 46:59.590
Yeah.

46:59.590 --> 47:01.590
Do we feel sorry for him? No.

47:01.590 --> 47:02.490
No.

47:02.490 --> 47:04.020
Rotten bit of luck.

47:04.020 --> 47:06.610
erm... And final thing, bit of a used car tip really...

47:06.610 --> 47:08.980
if you're a person who does low mileage...

47:08.980 --> 47:11.620
chances are when you go to look for another, used car...

47:11.620 --> 47:15.520
you... you're kind of fascinated.
You wanna buy another car with low mileage...

47:15.520 --> 47:17.220
uh, it's absolutely the wrong thing to do...

47:17.220 --> 47:19.500
if you do low mileage, the thing to
do is actually buy a car with...

47:19.500 --> 47:21.180
massively high mileage.

47:21.180 --> 47:23.770
Reason being, the cars with over 60,000 miles...

47:23.770 --> 47:26.020
are being hit in the trade big time.

47:26.020 --> 47:28.020
So they are so cheap, it's untrue.

47:28.020 --> 47:31.010
Give you an example, you can go out and buy a '97 P plate...

47:31.010 --> 47:33.680
Mercedes estate car, C200, something like that...

47:33.680 --> 47:35.520
with average mileage, 50,000 miles...

47:35.520 --> 47:36.970
it'll cost you 9,500.

47:36.970 --> 47:37.470
Yeah.

47:37.470 --> 47:38.950
Okay? Not a bad car.

47:38.950 --> 47:42.150
Or you could buy one with higher
mileage, say 80,000 miles, and you get...

47:42.150 --> 47:44.550
2000 model year, a car three years newer...

47:44.550 --> 47:45.770
for the same money.

47:45.770 --> 47:46.380
Really?

47:46.380 --> 47:48.380
Absolutely, so if you're doing low mileage...

47:48.380 --> 47:49.450
you run it for a couple of years...

47:49.450 --> 47:51.790
Cause these engines will last 150...

47:51.790 --> 47:53.380
probably even 200,000 miles.

47:52.760 --> 47:53.320
Absolutely...

47:53.430 --> 47:55.970
this is the thing, so don't be
afraid of the mileage basically.

47:55.970 --> 47:59.250
80-90,000 mile car, you're still
gonna have 60,000 miles left in it.

47:59.250 --> 48:04.290
So, that means, in the last 2 minutes,
you've saved everyone about 25,000 pounds.

48:04.290 --> 48:05.100
Hopefully, yeah.

48:05.100 --> 48:07.550
Thanks very much for that. Now, Jay...

48:07.550 --> 48:08.750
good news...

48:08.750 --> 48:11.900
you were once told, that you couldn't be a rally driver...

48:11.900 --> 48:13.900
now we're gonna find out, how good you are...

48:13.900 --> 48:16.240
or bad, on a track. we've got the tape.

48:16.240 --> 48:16.800
Okay.

48:16.800 --> 48:17.780
You wanna see it?

48:17.780 --> 48:18.610
Might as well.

48:18.610 --> 48:19.500
Run it.

48:26.970 --> 48:27.860
Okay.

48:28.830 --> 48:30.730
I like this third gear business.

48:31.540 --> 48:33.510
I like this third gear business.

48:34.350 --> 48:36.580
I must get this right.

48:37.380 --> 48:40.200
I must, learn to drive...

48:40.620 --> 48:41.810
properly.

48:41.810 --> 48:44.240
And it's a side turning there... and it's there.

48:44.460 --> 48:46.940
It's there. That's better. That's better.

48:46.940 --> 48:49.330
That's better. That's better.

48:50.110 --> 48:52.040
That's there all the way.

48:54.010 --> 48:55.290
This the one... ooh.

48:57.630 --> 49:01.650
Don't be panicked, don't be tempted to put too much power on.

49:01.650 --> 49:03.650
That's beautiful.

49:03.900 --> 49:06.190
I'm gonna get this down even further.

49:06.330 --> 49:09.610
Get it out of reach of Clarkson and his henchmen.

49:10.170 --> 49:12.560
This is the one, this is the punisher.

49:13.230 --> 49:14.070
76...

49:14.070 --> 49:15.660
80...

49:15.660 --> 49:18.160
82... bang it in there.

49:20.110 --> 49:22.060
And back we go...

49:22.560 --> 49:24.900
It's flat in third, come on...

49:24.040 --> 49:24.740
In third?

49:24.740 --> 49:25.800
Yeah but I don't wanna...

49:25.320 --> 49:26.580
In a fourth gear corner?

49:26.580 --> 49:28.580
Yeah, but then you'd... you'd never keep the revs up.

49:28.580 --> 49:29.080
And there.

49:29.080 --> 49:32.120
Well, you'd keep the speed up,
and flat through there, through there?

49:31.120 --> 49:32.760
Flat. Flat.

49:33.680 --> 49:35.680
Okay, how fast did you get along here?

49:35.680 --> 49:37.020
This is a crucial bit...

49:35.770 --> 49:36.570
Err...

49:37.040 --> 49:39.110
Well, I think I... well I dunno... I'm, I'm trying to..

49:39.110 --> 49:40.780
87 I once hit there.

49:40.780 --> 49:43.400
Have you ever driven anything as cheap as this in your life?

49:42.750 --> 49:43.480
Err, listen...

49:43.510 --> 49:45.720
lets... before we say this is cheap... okay?

49:45.720 --> 49:48.320
This is... this is, 10,000 pounds for that...

49:48.320 --> 49:49.530
9,995.

49:49.530 --> 49:50.250
Oh, I'm sorry...

49:49.920 --> 49:50.590
And, here we go...

49:50.590 --> 49:54.280
and you're across the line... in the 9,995 car.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.020
I crossed the line... in the car.

49:54.310 --> 49:55.140
And I, oh...

49:55.140 --> 49:57.060
God, I'm... I... I don't know.

49:55.680 --> 49:56.350
What are you doing here?

49:57.060 --> 49:57.800
What happens...

49:58.690 --> 49:59.800
Have you lost it?

50:00.510 --> 50:02.280
Oh, look at that, ladies and gentlemen...

50:02.280 --> 50:03.380
and handbrake turn.

50:02.850 --> 50:03.380
...turn.

50:03.380 --> 50:09.190
<i># Beaten Jeremy, I've beaten
Jeremy Clarkson on the track. #</i>

50:09.340 --> 50:10.310
Now...

50:11.490 --> 50:12.640
These are the times so far.

50:12.640 --> 50:14.970
Can we get a camera nice and tight on Jay because...

50:14.970 --> 50:17.460
I've got your laptime, okay?

50:18.290 --> 50:20.000
We're gonna get nice and tight...

50:20.470 --> 50:22.170
Jay... Kay...

50:22.590 --> 50:23.380
Okay?

50:23.750 --> 50:25.380
1...

50:27.170 --> 50:30.050
:48.10.

50:34.570 --> 50:36.200
That's astonishing.

50:38.380 --> 50:42.430
Get it up there... get it up there...
straighten it up... straighten it up.

50:43.920 --> 50:46.080
Genuinely happy about that.

50:46.080 --> 50:48.540
It's not that I'm a sore loser, or anything...

50:49.090 --> 50:50.590
You're just gutted.

50:50.590 --> 50:52.590
You're smarting inside.

50:52.780 --> 50:53.660
I'm hurt.

50:53.660 --> 50:54.840
I know, I can se...

50:54.080 --> 50:54.840
So hurt...

50:54.840 --> 50:57.620
that I'm gonna humiliate you by
showing everyone a little clip...

50:58.470 --> 51:00.280
of you doing some practice...

51:00.270 --> 51:01.220
in the Suzuki.

51:14.880 --> 51:17.420
Ladies and gentlemen, Jay Kay!

51:21.400 --> 51:23.910
Right, right...

51:24.290 --> 51:27.160
I'm gonna say it, I'm gonna do this...

51:27.160 --> 51:28.870
I'm gonna say it...

51:28.870 --> 51:30.320
I don't like all RSs.

51:30.440 --> 51:31.020
Okay?

51:31.880 --> 51:33.020
I'm sorry, I ju...

51:33.070 --> 51:34.460
I just don't. There were some...

51:34.460 --> 51:36.340
I couldn't get on with. Let me explain.

51:54.220 --> 51:56.140
The whole '80s RS thing...

51:56.140 --> 51:57.950
huge bonnet scoops and spoilers...

51:57.950 --> 52:01.110
I dunno, it all kind of left
me behind a bit, left me a bit...

52:01.110 --> 52:01.900
cold.

52:01.900 --> 52:03.520
No, for me...

52:03.520 --> 52:06.540
the RS legend wears sideburns and a rally jacket...

52:06.540 --> 52:08.120
so I look back in lust...

52:08.120 --> 52:11.820
at this; the Ford RS 1800.

52:11.820 --> 52:15.850
It was only made for two years
and was killed off in 1977.

52:17.040 --> 52:18.460
'Course, you might have missed that...

52:18.460 --> 52:21.090
'77 was quiet a busy year.

52:32.890 --> 52:34.400
I was 6...

52:34.400 --> 52:38.000
and I howled with desire every time I saw one.

52:38.000 --> 52:42.130
God, I wanted one. And no, I didn't just want one...

52:42.130 --> 52:44.660
I really, really needed one.

52:44.660 --> 52:47.260
It had absolutely everything you could want...

52:47.260 --> 52:49.260
alloy wheels, Recaro seats...

52:49.260 --> 52:51.260
tonnes of racing pedigree...

52:51.260 --> 52:53.860
even a wing on the back... wow.

52:57.550 --> 52:59.160
If all that sounds a bit meek...

52:59.160 --> 53:02.100
next to today's rather more spectacular stuff...

53:02.100 --> 53:04.100
let me put it into context for you.

53:06.820 --> 53:09.840
The RS 1800 is Ford's most successful...

53:09.840 --> 53:11.350
rally car, ever.

53:11.350 --> 53:15.200
It still wins today in Clubman and International rallies.

53:15.200 --> 53:16.830
And it still wins.

53:31.470 --> 53:33.440
This had, proper credibility...

53:33.440 --> 53:36.180
real pedigree. It didn't earn its stripes...

53:36.180 --> 53:38.780
joyriding, and you didn't judge its success by...

53:38.780 --> 53:40.780
the size of the insurance claims.

53:40.780 --> 53:43.480
I always, always wanted to drive one...

53:43.980 --> 53:46.250
and I'm gonna drive this one... oh boy.

53:55.880 --> 53:59.860
This is every bit as delicious as I thought it would be.

53:59.860 --> 54:02.190
It's a machine, a proper machine, it's got...

54:02.190 --> 54:05.150
moving parts, and it's not ashamed of it.

54:05.760 --> 54:08.560
It may only boast 115 brake horsepower now...

54:08.560 --> 54:11.040
sure, you can get scooters with that much...

54:11.040 --> 54:13.940
but underneath at the front, there's an 1800cc...

54:13.940 --> 54:16.270
double overhead cam, 16 valve...

54:16.270 --> 54:18.150
alloy-blocked Cosworth engine.

54:18.150 --> 54:20.720
And in 1975, that was the equivalent of...

54:20.720 --> 54:23.210
cruise missile technology.

54:23.210 --> 54:25.420
This was clever high tech stuff.

54:25.420 --> 54:26.560
Really, it was.

54:31.730 --> 54:35.150
Mind you, as soon as you go through
anything like a chicane, you're...

54:35.150 --> 54:38.260
well aware of the fact that we've
got old car springs at the back.

54:38.260 --> 54:41.050
Body control really wasn't what it is today.

54:46.940 --> 54:50.850
4.9 million Escorts were sold in the UK...

54:50.850 --> 54:53.510
of which, 109...

54:53.510 --> 54:55.140
were RS 1800s.

54:55.370 --> 54:56.880
That tells you something about the rarity...

54:56.880 --> 54:59.380
There are 25 of them left running today.

54:59.590 --> 55:02.280
Interestingly, 2 of the 109 made...

55:02.280 --> 55:04.580
were red, of which one survived.

55:04.580 --> 55:06.530
So, if you're digging around in your shed...

55:06.530 --> 55:08.440
and you find a red one...

55:08.440 --> 55:10.800
look after it, it's worth a couple of quid.

55:17.570 --> 55:21.520
See, mark my words, there is gonna be a huge market...

55:21.520 --> 55:24.390
for 1970s cars, because...

55:24.390 --> 55:28.220
people like us, grew up with
them. Couldn't afford 'em then...

55:28.220 --> 55:30.700
couldn't drive 'em then. Now we can...

55:30.700 --> 55:33.350
and if we're lucky, we can afford to buy them.

55:49.440 --> 55:50.760
Do you know, in an odd way...

55:50.760 --> 55:52.380
it's getting to feel...

55:52.380 --> 55:55.190
like an antique, and I don't mean cause of the age.

55:55.190 --> 55:57.530
I think it's to do with the controls.

55:57.530 --> 55:59.670
They're somehow finer, more delicate to operate.

55:59.670 --> 56:02.070
They haven't got that engineered in chunkiness you get...

56:02.070 --> 56:03.960
in modern car controls.

56:03.960 --> 56:05.630
But don't let the antique thing fool you...

56:05.630 --> 56:08.290
in its day, that was a potent force.

56:08.290 --> 56:11.310
That, if you ask me, is a proper RS.

56:14.200 --> 56:18.270
See? I like RSs as well. Can
I explain something about that...

56:18.270 --> 56:19.780
Do you know... I wasn't really going...

56:19.780 --> 56:21.420
well I wasn't really going very fast.

56:21.420 --> 56:22.370
No, you weren't.

56:22.370 --> 56:22.870
No, well...

56:22.870 --> 56:24.870
I thought you were being a bit light in your loafers.

56:25.180 --> 56:26.870
The guy who owned it was there...

56:27.130 --> 56:27.440
Ah.

56:27.440 --> 56:30.460
and he's really big and scary, so I drove like Sister Wendy.

56:30.460 --> 56:32.340
I'm sorry. Anyway...

56:32.340 --> 56:34.270
action, serious action now...

56:34.270 --> 56:36.060
buses, jumping over motorbikes.

56:36.060 --> 56:38.100
There's no particularly good reason why we're doing this...

56:38.100 --> 56:39.690
I don't think you need one, it's just a fun thing to do.

56:39.690 --> 56:42.560
So, here's what happens, finally, we promise you this...

56:42.560 --> 56:44.560
when you try and jump a bus...

56:44.560 --> 56:46.340
over 14 motorbikes.

57:29.040 --> 57:29.630
Oh...

57:29.630 --> 57:31.750
Why are you laughing, it's your license fee.

57:38.100 --> 57:39.250
That was almost...

57:39.250 --> 57:40.990
too much fun. If anybody's interested...

57:40.990 --> 57:42.760
do you wanna know how many bikes it cleared?

57:42.120 --> 57:42.700
I do.

57:42.790 --> 57:44.240
Yeah, how many did it clear?

57:44.240 --> 57:46.830
It did actually clear... 3.

57:47.130 --> 57:49.020
3 bikes it cleared properly...

57:47.660 --> 57:48.970
So, who said 3?

57:49.020 --> 57:49.780
Did anybody say that?

57:49.780 --> 57:50.640
Who said 3?

57:50.170 --> 57:51.740
He sa... he says he did, but I don't believe him...

57:50.800 --> 57:51.710
You said 3?

57:51.760 --> 57:52.760
but, give him the mints.

57:51.800 --> 57:53.600
Werther's Originals.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.370
-Three, clearly.

57:56.400 --> 57:58.370
-Three?

57:59.960 --> 58:01.350
Destroyed 14 others, but...

58:01.350 --> 58:02.960
I know, I hate motorbikes.

58:02.960 --> 58:04.860
I do, I loathe them. If I'd have
been driving the bus, I'd have...

58:04.860 --> 58:05.690
backed up.

58:06.100 --> 58:09.010
Reversed over... there we go, that's got those three as well.

58:07.620 --> 58:08.730
Nice, Jeremy, nice.

58:09.050 --> 58:10.850
erm... And that's sadly...

58:10.850 --> 58:12.360
is all we've got time for...

58:12.360 --> 58:12.930
this week.

58:12.930 --> 58:15.430
Next week, I shall be driving the best looking car...

58:15.430 --> 58:17.000
in the world, ever.

58:17.000 --> 58:20.510
Some small children will be
deciding on their favourite supercar...

58:20.510 --> 58:22.510
for their bedroom walls.

58:22.570 --> 58:24.810
And, um... oh you remember last week...

58:24.810 --> 58:26.770
we asked if there were any grannies out there...

58:26.770 --> 58:28.770
who thought they could do a doughnut?

58:29.000 --> 58:31.430
thousands replied, saying they'd like to try.

58:31.940 --> 58:33.120
So, we let them.

58:40.260 --> 58:42.370
That, is going to be on, next week.

58:42.370 --> 58:43.700
See you then.

58:43.700 --> 58:46.700
