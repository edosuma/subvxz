- We've been friends for a long time.

Maybe all it means is that
it's been a long time,

mean you're a good friend.

I'm gonna have to tell Sam
you were rude to me.

00:40.356 --> 00:43.190
Oh, I understand.
And Sam heard everything.

00:43.192 --> 00:46.276

I prefer "Samantha."

Uh-oh. Someone's pissy.

08:19.637 --> 08:20.952
Is the heat getting to you?
(Chuckles)

08:20.954 --> 08:23.555
No. I'm trying to reach Samantha
to tell her something

08:23.557 --> 08:25.290
I don't really want
to tell her,

08:25.292 --> 08:27.342
so I thought it might be easier
over the phone.

08:27.344 --> 08:29.344
Ah, the phone dump,
friendship edition.

08:29.346 --> 08:31.296
I'm not dumping her.
I just need her to...

08:31.298 --> 08:33.432
To leave Larissa's apartment?

08:33.433 --> 08:34.765
Walt told you?

08:34.768 --> 08:37.135
Yeah, he needed advice to avoid
looking at her lady parts,

08:37.136 --> 08:38.604
and I had loads of it.

08:38.606 --> 08:39.804
(Chuckles)
Roommates can be tough.

08:39.806 --> 08:41.806
I love Stanford,
but I gotta admit,

08:41.808 --> 08:44.776
I'm happy that he ran off to
London to work at the Batcave,

08:44.778 --> 08:46.745
leaving me all by my lonesome.

08:46.747 --> 08:48.614
- The Batcave?
- Thank you.

08:48.616 --> 08:50.282
Yes. He's very
into glam rock.

08:50.284 --> 08:52.918
You should see his collection
of high heel boots.

08:52.920 --> 08:54.319
So why can't you just
tell this chick to go?

08:54.321 --> 08:57.039
Because she's not just
some chick. She's a new friend.

08:57.041 --> 09:00.092
And also, I may have
a pathological fear

09:00.094 --> 09:02.010
of hurting people's feelings.

09:02.012 --> 09:04.546
And also, she came to me because
she has nowhere else to go.

09:04.548 --> 09:06.465
I mean, I don't want her
to be homeless.

09:06.467 --> 09:10.168
Walt was right.
You are <i>way</i> over thinking this.

09:10.170 --> 09:11.687
And kind of a wuss.

09:11.689 --> 09:14.373
He called me a wuss?

09:14.375 --> 09:16.608
Speaking of Walt,
his birthday is this Saturday.

09:16.610 --> 09:17.693
I know.

09:17.695 --> 09:20.012
And I'm planning him
a little something.

09:20.014 --> 09:21.730
<i>This</i> Saturday?

09:21.732 --> 09:22.847
I'm going to that

09:22.849 --> 09:24.950
Z100 music festival
in the park.

09:24.952 --> 09:26.068
We're doing a feature

09:26.070 --> 09:27.236
on this great new band,
American Authors,

09:27.238 --> 09:30.155
and I'm supposed
to check them out.

09:30.157 --> 09:32.040
That's, uh... so great

09:32.042 --> 09:35.661
because that exact Z100 concert
you're talking about

09:35.663 --> 09:37.746
is what I'm doing
for Walt's birthday.

09:37.748 --> 09:40.048
That's awesome! I can't wait
to celebrate with Walt.

09:40.050 --> 09:42.033
- What a coincidence.
(Chuckles) - Perfect.

09:42.035 --> 09:43.969
So we can meet up
in the V.I.P. Section.

09:43.971 --> 09:46.888
Yes. Yes. Uh...
The V.I.P. Section.

09:46.890 --> 09:49.207
I'm so excited.
My... my tickets are there, too.

09:49.209 --> 09:51.960
I'm impressed you could even get
more than one V.I.P. Pass.

09:51.962 --> 09:54.012
I was lucky to get one myself,
and I'm covering it.

09:54.014 --> 09:55.147
I know, right?

09:55.149 --> 09:58.150
Uh, good thing I planned it
so far in advance.

09:58.152 --> 09:59.735
Yay me.

10:02.355 --> 10:04.606
No, I get it.
There are no more tickets.

10:04.608 --> 10:08.277
You... you don't have to
be rude.

10:08.279 --> 10:11.363
What did you call me?

10:11.365 --> 10:13.749
No, I didn't mean say it again.

10:16.068 --> 10:17.452
<i>While it looked like</i>
<i>my promise to Walt</i>

10:17.454 --> 10:20.572
<i>would be impossible</i>
<i>to fulfill...</i>

10:20.574 --> 10:22.958
(Door opens) <i>(Carrie) Mouse was about
to meet someone who had no trouble</i>

10:22.960 --> 10:26.244
<i>fulfilling any man's wildest fantasies.
</i> (Door closes)

10:26.246 --> 10:27.963
(Horn honks in distance)

10:27.965 --> 10:29.581
Oh, hi. I'm Mouse.

10:29.583 --> 10:30.632
Samantha.

10:30.634 --> 10:31.800
I figured.

10:31.802 --> 10:33.585
I've been really looking forward
to meeting you.

10:33.587 --> 10:35.470
Uh, don't worry. I won't
interrupt your workout.

10:35.472 --> 10:36.555
I'm just going to be
in the kitchen,

10:36.557 --> 10:38.974
putting stuff away
for Walt's quiche.

10:38.976 --> 10:41.276
Oh. Are you doing
Jane Fonda?

10:41.278 --> 10:44.363
I did that once.
My butt hurt for days.

10:44.365 --> 10:46.782
Do you like pain?
What?

10:46.784 --> 10:49.017
(Breathy voice) Oh, yeah.
That's right, baby.

10:49.019 --> 10:50.702
Just like I like it.

10:50.704 --> 10:51.903
Excuse me?

10:51.905 --> 10:53.655
Not you, honey. I'm workin'.

10:53.657 --> 10:55.324
You mean working <i>out.</i>

10:55.326 --> 10:56.441
Huh?

10:56.443 --> 10:59.795
Hot, baby.
You make me so hot.

10:59.797 --> 11:01.046
What?

11:01.048 --> 11:02.964
That's right.
There you go.

11:02.966 --> 11:04.833
(Squeals and pants)

11:04.835 --> 11:06.951
Talk tomorrow. Same time.

11:06.953 --> 11:10.005
(Beep)
Ugh. Finally.

11:10.007 --> 11:11.956
Some of them take forever.

11:11.958 --> 11:14.092
Although that just means
more money for me.

11:14.094 --> 11:16.345
You get paid to do butt lifts?

11:16.347 --> 11:18.013
What? No.

11:18.015 --> 11:19.348
I'm a phone sex operator.

11:19.350 --> 11:21.132
I get paid to make men happy.

11:21.134 --> 11:23.352
I do Jane while I do them.

11:23.354 --> 11:25.520
The heavy breathing really
keeps 'em goin'

11:25.522 --> 11:27.639
and keeps my ass...
(High-pitched voice) Perky!

11:27.641 --> 11:29.908
<i>♪</i>

11:29.910 --> 11:31.360
Phone sex? Huh.

11:31.362 --> 11:34.446
Well... what's that like?

11:34.448 --> 11:36.965
Hang on. Do you mean
you're a phone sex virgin?

11:36.967 --> 11:38.533
Pretty much.

11:38.535 --> 11:43.004
My boyfriend tried to initiate
it with me the other night.

11:43.006 --> 11:45.290
Is it weird I'm telling you
this? We just met.

11:45.292 --> 11:46.842
No. People open up to me.

11:46.844 --> 11:49.010
Must be like talking to a nun
or something.

11:49.012 --> 11:52.013
A very sexy, naughty nun.

11:52.015 --> 11:54.282
I should try that
with my new phone sex guy.

11:54.284 --> 11:55.801
Religion can be very hot.

11:57.169 --> 11:59.371
Anyway, go on.
Phone sex, boyfriend.

11:59.373 --> 12:00.972
I don't think I handled it
all that well.

12:00.974 --> 12:02.924
I freaked out and hung up.

12:02.926 --> 12:04.943
Ugh. You're a sad case.

12:04.945 --> 12:06.177
But I can help you.

12:06.179 --> 12:08.179
You're gonna blow
your boyfriend's mind.

12:08.181 --> 12:09.364
I am?

12:09.366 --> 12:11.149
And a few other things.

12:11.151 --> 12:14.069
Being good at phone sex
is like being a good lawyer.

12:14.071 --> 12:15.787
It's all about
leading the witness.

12:15.789 --> 12:17.038
You say as little as possible

12:17.040 --> 12:19.624
to get them to spill
what you want them to <i>spill.</i>

12:19.626 --> 12:21.910
And what exactly do I say?

12:21.912 --> 12:25.297
You ask them what they want,
then you let them talk.

12:25.299 --> 12:26.665
Fill in the silences

12:26.667 --> 12:28.667
with anything involving
the words "big" or "hot"

12:28.669 --> 12:31.553
or something about them being
the best you've ever had.

12:31.555 --> 12:33.505
Then throw in a few moans.

12:33.507 --> 12:35.307
Horny guys are not
that complicated.

12:35.309 --> 12:36.508
(Telephone rings)

12:36.510 --> 12:38.176
That must be my 2:00.

12:38.178 --> 12:39.878
(Beep)

12:39.880 --> 12:41.263
(Breathy voice)
Hey there, big boy.

12:41.265 --> 12:42.481
(Chuckles)

12:42.483 --> 12:43.565
It's hot out, isn't it?

12:43.567 --> 12:45.450
How do you feel about
a sexy Oriental?

12:45.452 --> 12:49.237
She's ready and waiting
and barely legal.

12:50.773 --> 12:52.107
Give it a try.

12:52.109 --> 12:53.859
Go on.

12:55.060 --> 12:57.212
Hello?

12:57.214 --> 12:58.530
Yes.

12:58.532 --> 12:59.915
It is <i>hot.</i>

13:01.000 --> 13:03.401
Uh, <i>big hot.</i>

13:03.403 --> 13:07.339
Uh, excuse me? What was that,
sir? I didn't quite hear.

13:09.208 --> 13:11.343
I most certainly will not!

13:11.345 --> 13:12.627
(Beep) (Scoffs)

13:12.629 --> 13:14.396
It takes practice.

13:14.398 --> 13:16.114
You'll be fine.

13:19.051 --> 13:20.185
You glad to be back?

13:20.187 --> 13:21.436
Or were you having so much fun

13:21.438 --> 13:23.421
- that you wish you were still there?
<i>- Are you kidding?</i>

13:23.423 --> 13:25.557
Dylan threw up
on Space Mountain

13:25.559 --> 13:29.394
and in that little globe thingy
at Epcot.

13:29.396 --> 13:32.147
There's only so much vomit
I can handle.

13:32.149 --> 13:34.566
Well, hopefully my cooking
won't induce it.

13:34.568 --> 13:36.401
I'm a little nervous.

13:36.403 --> 13:38.820
- What? About my cooking?
- No.

13:38.822 --> 13:40.372
It's the first time
I'm gonna see your place.

13:40.374 --> 13:41.907
Well, then I guess
I should be nervous.

13:41.909 --> 13:43.158
Are you running around

13:43.160 --> 13:45.627
and hiding
all your dirty little secrets?

13:45.629 --> 13:48.129
(Laughs) Should I be?

13:48.131 --> 13:49.464
Well, that's up to you.

13:49.466 --> 13:50.615
I'll see you tomorrow.

13:50.617 --> 13:52.851
Bye.
(Line disconnects)

13:54.286 --> 13:56.221
(Telephone beeps)

13:58.474 --> 14:00.275
Ugh. (Whispers) God.

14:02.478 --> 14:03.728
<i>My father wondered</i>

14:03.730 --> 14:05.296
<i>if he should hide the pictures</i>
<i>of my mother.</i>

14:05.298 --> 14:07.682
<i>She wasn't</i>
<i>a dirty little secret.</i>

14:07.684 --> 14:10.168
<i>She was the love of his life.</i>

14:10.170 --> 14:11.386
<i>But he wasn't sure</i>

14:11.388 --> 14:14.022
<i>if that was something</i>
<i>Deb would want to see.</i>

14:14.024 --> 14:15.640
(Egg taps table)

14:17.693 --> 14:19.027
Pepper.

14:19.029 --> 14:21.980
I just had it.
Where's the pepper?

14:21.982 --> 14:23.281
Keep it together, Mouse.

14:23.283 --> 14:25.317
The last time you cooked,
the fire department showed up.

14:25.319 --> 14:27.118
Why are you wearing
Larissa's dress?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.203
It's an apron.

14:28.205 --> 14:30.505
Do you think Larissa owns
an apron?

14:30.507 --> 14:33.458
This thing was sewn
by silkworms

14:33.460 --> 14:36.511
raised by blind Tibetan Monks
or something.

14:36.513 --> 14:39.047
If Larissa comes back
and sees it covered in grease,

14:39.049 --> 14:40.682
I'm a dead woman.

14:42.268 --> 14:43.385
If you were naked in the tub

14:43.387 --> 14:44.603
and someone asked
if you were decent,

14:44.605 --> 14:46.638
would you let them come in?

14:46.640 --> 14:48.523
Samantha's taking
another bubble bath?

14:48.525 --> 14:51.560
Does she only do activities
that require nudity?

14:51.562 --> 14:54.062
Did you tell her yet?

14:55.281 --> 14:56.648
Don't worry.

14:56.650 --> 14:59.183
I told her I have to talk to her
about something important.

14:59.185 --> 15:01.536
I'll do it as soon
as she gets out of the tub.

15:01.538 --> 15:02.704
Make sure you do.

15:02.706 --> 15:04.205
It's only five days
until Larissa comes back.

15:04.207 --> 15:07.208
And we got a $400 phone bill,
thanks to Sam.

15:07.210 --> 15:08.827
Yikes!

15:08.829 --> 15:09.995
Right.

15:09.997 --> 15:13.465
I'm going to get my hair cut
for my event,

15:13.467 --> 15:14.833
whatever it may be.

15:14.835 --> 15:16.367
Yeah. Great.

15:16.369 --> 15:19.804
Your amazing birthday event
that I have totally planned out.

15:19.806 --> 15:23.091
Why are you acting weird?
Should I not get my hair cut?

15:23.093 --> 15:24.876
Is that making it
too much of a big deal?

15:24.878 --> 15:26.094
'Cause maybe we should
just forget this whole thing.

15:26.096 --> 15:27.178
Oh, no!

15:27.180 --> 15:29.147
No, your 18th birthday
is a <i>huge</i> deal.

15:29.149 --> 15:32.400
And Bennet's going to be there.
He seemed really excited.

15:32.402 --> 15:34.102
And I'll be there to support you
the whole time.

15:34.104 --> 15:35.820
(Sighs)

15:35.822 --> 15:38.940
- Well, that helps. Thanks, Carrie.
- Don't mention it.

15:38.942 --> 15:40.692
Now go get handsome
for your big day.

15:40.694 --> 15:42.143
Bye.

15:42.145 --> 15:43.895
(Horn blaring in distance)

15:43.897 --> 15:45.080
I can't believe
you didn't tell him

15:45.082 --> 15:46.865
you don't have anything
planned.

15:46.867 --> 15:48.199
(Door closes) I can't help it

15:48.201 --> 15:50.201
if people camp out for days
for that stupid concert.

15:50.203 --> 15:53.088
What am I gonna do?
It's tomorrow.

15:53.090 --> 15:55.123
You talking about
the Z100 concert?

15:55.125 --> 15:57.258
I can get your tickets.

15:57.260 --> 15:58.960
Wait. What? You can?

16:00.245 --> 16:01.513
V.I.P. Tickets?

16:01.515 --> 16:02.847
Sure.

16:02.849 --> 16:05.450
I met Howard stern a few years
back and... rocked his mic.

16:05.452 --> 16:06.551
We're still buds.

16:06.553 --> 16:08.553
And now that he's
the toast of New York,

16:08.555 --> 16:10.355
honey, he can get us in
anywhere.

16:10.357 --> 16:12.140
Uh... seriously?

16:12.142 --> 16:14.259
Y-you could do that?

16:14.261 --> 16:15.443
Thank you so much.

16:15.445 --> 16:17.929
No problem, Bambi.
It's just a simple phone call.

16:19.031 --> 16:21.900
Wasn't there something important
you wanted to tell me?

16:21.902 --> 16:24.152
Um... yeah.

16:24.154 --> 16:25.570
Toilet paper.

16:25.572 --> 16:26.738
We're out.

16:26.740 --> 16:28.073
Maybe you could get some?

16:28.075 --> 16:29.958
Sure thing.

16:29.960 --> 16:31.960
(Horn honks in distance)

16:31.962 --> 16:33.294
What?

16:33.296 --> 16:35.213
I can't kick her out now.
She just saved Walt's birthday.

♪ Beautiful

25:34.356 --> 25:35.439

25:36.942 --> 25:38.642

25:38.644 --> 25:40.360
Oh. Our A.C. is not
the best.

25:40.362 --> 25:41.645
(Stomach rumbles)

25:41.647 --> 25:43.597
I know it's miserable.
August in New York is awful.

25:43.599 --> 25:44.782
♪ Oh, yeah

25:44.784 --> 25:47.367
well, on a happier note,
Ms. Bradshaw,

25:47.369 --> 25:49.486
I think you'd make a great
candidate for the program.

25:49.488 --> 25:51.739
Really? I... I hope so.

25:51.741 --> 25:52.923
Um...

25:52.925 --> 25:54.792
I think the next step for me,

25:54.794 --> 25:56.193
as a writer,

25:56.195 --> 25:58.212
um...
(Stomach rumbles)

25:58.214 --> 25:59.963
Is it, um...

25:59.965 --> 26:01.799
Do you feel like
the room is spinning?

26:01.801 --> 26:04.551
(Voice echoing) Uh...

26:04.553 --> 26:06.420
I'm sorry. Are you...

26:06.422 --> 26:08.672
(Stomach rumbles)
(Grunts) Oh, no.

26:08.674 --> 26:10.385
(Vomits)

26:13.863 --> 26:15.741
(Crying)
What's happening to us?

26:15.743 --> 26:18.059
Have we been poisoned?

26:18.061 --> 26:20.365
(Vomiting and coughing)

26:20.485 --> 26:23.095
(Groans) I'm sorry, Walt.

26:23.215 --> 26:24.965
I just puked
all over your presents.

26:24.967 --> 26:28.669
And I got you the nicest striped
Calvin Klein tie. (Gags)

26:28.671 --> 26:30.104
(Vomits)

26:30.106 --> 26:31.806
Hey, Walt!

26:31.808 --> 26:33.691
Look! (Vomits)

26:33.693 --> 26:35.192
(Vomits and coughs)

26:35.194 --> 26:37.528
(Man) Aw, man.

26:37.530 --> 26:40.314
Make it stop. Make it stop.

26:40.316 --> 26:43.551
How are you not sick?

26:43.553 --> 26:44.652
I'm from the everglades.
(Coughs)

26:44.654 --> 26:46.871
I've had alligator roadkill
for breakfast.

26:46.873 --> 26:48.072
Nothing can break me.

26:48.074 --> 26:49.857
I'm gonna die here!
It's not fair!

26:49.859 --> 26:52.743
I am too beautiful to be
a Central Park corpse!

26:52.745 --> 26:54.528
- Aah!
- Get it together!

26:54.530 --> 26:55.963
You... you slapped me.

26:55.965 --> 26:57.298
Had to be done.

26:57.300 --> 26:59.083
I'm getting you people
out of here.

26:59.085 --> 27:01.802
Come on. Let's do this
kindergarten-style.

27:01.804 --> 27:04.004
(Groans)
Single-file. Hold hands.

27:04.006 --> 27:05.218
- No.
- Come on.

27:05.338 --> 27:08.092
Bennet, help up Walt.
Come on, Mouse.

27:08.094 --> 27:09.510
(Mouse grunts)

27:09.512 --> 27:12.063
No barfers left behind.

27:12.065 --> 27:14.098
(Groaning)

27:14.100 --> 27:15.266
Where's Carrie?

27:15.268 --> 27:16.400
(Groans)

27:16.402 --> 27:19.770
(Breathing heavily)

27:19.772 --> 27:21.555
No, not again.
(Stomach rumbles)

27:21.557 --> 27:22.907
Ooh.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.284
The table
is officially cleared.

27:33.286 --> 27:36.337
He plies me with wine,
he serves hors d'oeuvres...

27:36.339 --> 27:39.406
Well, don't get too impressed.
Dinner will be hamburger helper.

27:39.388 --> 27:40.108
Ah.

27:40.110 --> 27:41.809
If we even make it to dinner.

27:41.811 --> 27:43.644
(Chuckles)

27:43.646 --> 27:45.530
I like how you think.

27:45.532 --> 27:47.865
Just as soon as I'm done
with these dishes.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.150
Uh, the dishes can wait.

27:49.152 --> 27:51.319
(Plate clatters)
Right, it's just... (Laughs)

27:51.321 --> 27:53.237
- Mm, these plates...
- Mm-hmm?

27:53.239 --> 27:54.855
- have melted cheese on them.
- Mm-hmm.

27:54.857 --> 27:56.600
And if we leave them,
they're gonna get crusty.

27:56.720 --> 27:57.817
Yeah. Who cares?

27:57.937 --> 27:59.827
So I... okay. (Giggles)

27:59.829 --> 28:00.878
(Starts engine)

28:00.880 --> 28:03.748
(Revs engine)

28:03.750 --> 28:07.802
(Engine idling)

28:09.588 --> 28:11.255
(Turns off engine)

28:17.212 --> 28:19.647
How was Pebble Beach?

28:19.649 --> 28:22.400
Did I just hear this thing
purring like a cat?

28:22.402 --> 28:23.651
What, you do that yourself?

28:23.653 --> 28:24.819
Well, the guy
from the garage helped

28:24.821 --> 28:26.604
when I needed
an extra set of hands.

28:26.606 --> 28:29.741
Well, I'm impressed.
I guess I taught you well.

28:29.743 --> 28:31.943
Now we can add a few grand
to the price.

28:31.945 --> 28:33.361
What are you talking about?

28:33.363 --> 28:35.029
Well, it turns out
that my golf buddy Steve

28:35.031 --> 28:36.948
has wanted one of these things
for years.

28:36.950 --> 28:38.082
He made me a great offer.

28:38.084 --> 28:39.584
But now that you got it
up and running,

28:39.586 --> 28:41.452
I can charge him more.

28:41.454 --> 28:42.587
You sold our car?

28:42.589 --> 28:44.255
Nah, it's not <i>our</i> car.
It's <i>my</i> car.

28:44.257 --> 28:45.540
Don't you forget that.

28:45.542 --> 28:46.874
Okay, your car.

28:46.876 --> 28:49.260
But you said this was something
for us to work on together.

28:49.262 --> 28:50.428
Yeah, I don't know what
I was thinking,

28:50.430 --> 28:51.629
gettin' this thing
in the first place.

28:51.631 --> 28:52.964
These things are
a pain in the ass.

28:52.966 --> 28:54.966
And I don't have the time
to deal with something

28:54.968 --> 28:57.585
this unreliable.
You know what I mean?

28:57.587 --> 28:59.937
I do.

28:59.939 --> 29:01.773
You mind if I take it for a spin
before it's sold?

29:01.775 --> 29:04.025
Yeah, why the hell not?
Yeah.

29:04.027 --> 29:05.109
Enjoy it, kid.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.195
<i>Sebastian wanted to say</i>
<i>how angry he was</i>

29:07.197 --> 29:09.697
<i>that his father had</i>
<i>let him down.</i>

29:09.699 --> 29:13.234
<i>But there were no words</i>
<i>that seemed adequate.</i>

29:13.236 --> 29:14.902
<i>He'd have to make noise</i>
<i>another way.</i>

29:14.904 --> 29:16.704
(Starts engine)

29:24.779 --> 29:26.164
(Groans)

29:26.166 --> 29:27.882
(Groans)

29:32.671 --> 29:35.423
(Softly) - Come on, hon.
(Yells) - Get out of my face!

29:36.625 --> 29:37.725
How about it, Mouse?

29:37.727 --> 29:40.144
Think maybe you can
hold it down this time?

29:40.146 --> 29:42.346
(Whines and groans)

29:44.466 --> 29:46.818
You are all ruining my fantasy
of being your sexy nurse.

29:46.820 --> 29:48.035
(Scoffs)

29:48.037 --> 29:49.103
(Groans)

29:49.105 --> 29:51.255
How did this happen?

29:51.257 --> 29:54.079
It's gotta be food poisoning,
right?

29:54.199 --> 29:55.626
We had Thai food last night.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.311
- Mm.
- Maybe that?

29:57.313 --> 29:58.913
Don't...
talk about Thai food.

29:58.915 --> 30:00.348
Maybe the champagne?

30:00.350 --> 30:01.815
Can that give you
food poisoning?

30:01.817 --> 30:04.785
Don't talk about the champagne.

30:04.787 --> 30:05.953
Maybe the quiche then?

30:05.955 --> 30:08.105
Carrie, shut the hell up
with the food talk!

30:08.107 --> 30:09.540
There's no way
it was the quiche!

30:09.542 --> 30:11.442
That sucker was perfect.

30:11.444 --> 30:13.327
(Thud) Then what did we eat

30:13.329 --> 30:15.429
that's turning my stomach
into a pit of hell?

30:15.431 --> 30:17.164
Well, I may have misled you

30:17.166 --> 30:20.218
about the origins
of that caviar.

30:22.788 --> 30:25.189
<i>What...</i> are you saying?

30:25.191 --> 30:28.509
Let's just say it's not exactly
from the Caspian Sea.

30:28.511 --> 30:31.412
Where <i>is</i> it from?

30:31.414 --> 30:33.013
Coney Island.

30:33.015 --> 30:34.148
(Cries)

30:34.150 --> 30:35.349
I bought it off
the back of a truck,

30:35.351 --> 30:36.751
along with 300 fake Rolexes.

30:36.753 --> 30:38.986
What? Wait.

30:38.988 --> 30:41.122
<i>You</i> did this to us?

30:41.124 --> 30:42.406
I blame the Russian.

30:42.408 --> 30:44.242
He assured me it was perfectly safe.
(Stomach rumbles)

30:44.244 --> 30:45.826
(Scoffs) What a liar.

30:45.828 --> 30:47.245
He's probably not even
a real Russian.

30:47.247 --> 30:50.030
Ooh, I'm gonna kill you!
Just...

30:50.032 --> 30:51.332
Right after I...

30:51.334 --> 30:52.984
(Groans)

30:57.177 --> 30:59.461
(Breathy voice)
There. All better?

30:59.581 --> 31:02.665
Can you please not say it
in your sexy nurse voice?

31:02.667 --> 31:04.417
You.

31:04.419 --> 31:06.336
Look...

31:06.338 --> 31:08.204
- I'm really sorry.
- Oh, are you?

31:08.206 --> 31:09.889
Are you <i>really</i> sorry

31:09.891 --> 31:11.558
that I didn't get to tell
Professor Tenley

31:11.560 --> 31:13.376
what the next step is for me
as a writer?

31:13.378 --> 31:15.395
Did you know
I threw up three times

31:15.397 --> 31:17.230
in the middle
of my interview today?

31:17.232 --> 31:20.216
Three... once on her desk,
once on her lap,

31:20.218 --> 31:22.752
and once on her shoes,
which looked Italian.

31:22.754 --> 31:24.804
The smell of vomit...
It was... it was <i>everywhere.</i>

31:24.806 --> 31:25.989
It was everywhere.

31:25.991 --> 31:27.907
What do you mean interview?

31:27.909 --> 31:29.843
I thought you went to get closer
to Bryan Adams.

31:29.845 --> 31:33.196
(Sighs) No. I lied and didn't
tell you were I was going,

31:33.198 --> 31:34.948
which was to an interview
that could've changed my life

31:34.950 --> 31:36.833
because I <i>am</i> a wuss.

31:36.835 --> 31:38.084
(Sighs)

31:38.086 --> 31:39.752
I think I'll just let you two
work things out while I...

31:39.754 --> 31:41.037
No, I am not done with you.

31:41.039 --> 31:43.289
(Telephone rings)
Don't even touch that phone.

31:43.291 --> 31:45.408
You are not talking to
the spanker right now.

31:45.410 --> 31:47.877
Even this wuss has her limits, and
you have reached them. (Ring)

31:47.879 --> 31:49.462
You don't even care

31:49.464 --> 31:51.931
that you've been living
in someone else's place,

31:51.933 --> 31:53.916
where I am a guest,

31:53.918 --> 31:56.119
when you were only supposed
to stay a few days.

31:56.121 --> 31:58.188
And now you've taken over
Larissa's apartment

31:58.190 --> 31:59.422
and made my life miserable.

31:59.424 --> 32:01.808
So why don't you take
your tainted caviar

32:01.810 --> 32:03.309
and get the hell out of here?

32:03.311 --> 32:05.645
Um, I'm not sure it was
the caviar.

32:05.647 --> 32:06.762
What?

32:06.764 --> 32:08.231
Well, these are the eggs
I used for the quiche,

32:08.233 --> 32:10.750
and they expired on June 15th.

32:10.752 --> 32:12.035
I found them
in the refrigerator.

32:12.037 --> 32:13.770
Those are Larissa's eggs,

32:13.772 --> 32:15.738
from before she left
two months ago.

32:15.740 --> 32:18.374
We've barely opened the fridge
since we've been here.

32:18.376 --> 32:20.410
Well, then...

34:12.607 --> 34:15.241
This is actually a much better
send-off than I'm used to.

34:15.243 --> 34:16.185
My mom used to kick me out

34:16.304 --> 34:18.728
- whenever a new boyfriend would move in.
- That's terrible.

34:18.730 --> 34:22.114
Mm. She's the type of woman
who always puts men first.

34:22.117 --> 34:24.400
But you're not like that,
Carrie.

34:24.402 --> 34:27.170
You're a girl's girl.
That's why I like you.

34:27.172 --> 34:29.255
So...

34:29.257 --> 34:30.540
we're still friends?

34:30.542 --> 34:32.007
Honey, of course.

34:32.010 --> 34:34.627
We have to stay friends.
We wear the same size underwear.

34:34.629 --> 34:37.013
I don't even wanna know
how you know that.

34:37.014 --> 34:39.549
Just make me one promise.

34:39.551 --> 34:42.051
From now on,
give it to me straight,

34:42.053 --> 34:43.319
for your own good and mine.

34:43.321 --> 34:46.389
I promise.
And to that point,

34:46.391 --> 34:48.274
you better not be leaving
with any of my underwear.

34:48.275 --> 34:50.143

34:53.947 --> 34:55.648
I'll get it. (Grunts)

34:55.650 --> 34:57.867
I called the super.
You guys clogged all the pipes.

34:57.869 --> 34:59.118
(Groans)

34:59.120 --> 35:01.454

the super. It's Sebastian.

35:06.911 --> 35:08.628
You know what you have to do.

35:08.630 --> 35:10.913

Wow.

35:38.071 --> 35:39.520

35:39.522 --> 35:42.606

35:47.196 --> 35:49.713
That sounds bad.
Is there anything I can do?

35:49.715 --> 35:51.849
You can tell me
why you're here.

35:51.851 --> 35:53.584
Oh.

35:53.586 --> 35:55.369
I'm not exactly sure.
Uh...

35:55.371 --> 35:59.290
Just been going through stuff
with my dad, and...

35:59.292 --> 36:00.791
I just...

36:00.793 --> 36:02.243
I just wanted to see you.

36:02.245 --> 36:03.961

36:03.963 --> 36:06.764
Talk to you.

36:06.766 --> 36:07.898
About what?

36:07.900 --> 36:10.351
I don't know. Us?

36:10.353 --> 36:12.036
There's nothing to talk about.

36:12.038 --> 36:14.054
Come on. You must have stuff
you wanna say to me.

36:14.056 --> 36:15.303
I don't.

36:15.423 --> 36:17.558
- Carrie, I know that's not true.
- I don't want to talk to you

36:17.560 --> 36:20.177
because I don't think you wanna
hear what I have to say.

36:20.179 --> 36:22.113
You're wrong. Whatever you
have to say, I deserve it.

36:22.115 --> 36:23.247
Yes, you do.

36:23.249 --> 36:25.032
- Okay, so just say it.
- Fine.

36:25.034 --> 36:28.986
You broke me.

36:28.988 --> 36:31.472
You broke my heart.

36:31.474 --> 36:34.608
And I hate you
because I still love you.

36:36.278 --> 36:38.996
And I hate myself even more
for it.

36:40.566 --> 36:41.949
You happy?

36:46.788 --> 36:48.139

36:50.943 --> 36:52.310

- Does that freak you out?

37:10.029 --> 37:11.445
- Get it away from me. (Laughs)
- Huh?

37:11.447 --> 37:13.981

consulting a doctor

37:13.983 --> 37:15.333

I ever heard.

37:19.706 --> 37:21.488
No, seriously. We should
be proud of ourselves.

37:21.490 --> 37:23.657
We communicated honestly
and we were able to avoid

37:23.659 --> 37:26.294

a major <i>dish-aster.</i>

- Seriously.

37:32.518 --> 37:34.135
I'm just not the kind of guy
who gets bothered easily.

37:34.137 --> 37:36.003
Especially petty things like...

37:36.005 --> 37:38.856
Um, wait. What... why are you
putting the bowls on the top?

37:38.858 --> 37:40.641
'Cause that's where it belongs.

37:40.643 --> 37:42.176
No. No.
Bowls go on the bottom.

37:42.178 --> 37:44.445
(Bowl clatters) They go on the top.
That's where they fit better.

37:44.447 --> 37:45.947

- Top.

straight or gay.

39:45.401 --> 39:47.184

40:57.140 --> 40:58.556
Wait. She what?

She couldn't believe
that you showed up,

41:00.726 --> 41:02.510
given your obvious illness,

41:02.512 --> 41:05.045
that kind of dedication
deserves a second chance.
