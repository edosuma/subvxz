00:24.969 --> 00:27.568
To Maximilian Grushenko!

00:27.569 --> 00:30.894
This party is a happy night
for my humble establishment!

00:38.424 --> 00:40.948
I lift my glass to
the guests of honor,

00:40.949 --> 00:43.733
Sophia and my son Mischa.

00:43.734 --> 00:46.469
We honor their engagement.

00:46.470 --> 00:47.937
To my daughter and her young man,

00:47.938 --> 00:50.169
I wish you a glorious wedding,

00:50.170 --> 00:52.481
and a long and happy life.

00:52.482 --> 00:55.950
Does the best man
have a toast for us?

00:57.518 --> 00:59.537
To Sophia and Mischa,

00:59.538 --> 01:01.556
I'll see you under the table, huh?

01:03.131 --> 01:06.020
: Kiss, kiss, kiss, kiss...

01:10.499 --> 01:12.295
Now, I want to dance!

01:20.300 --> 01:22.310
Perfect match, no?

01:22.311 --> 01:24.269
Thank you for this
wonderful party.

01:24.270 --> 01:27.051
You have told your husband
the wonderful news?

01:27.052 --> 01:29.881
The last time that I took
the bus up to Greenhaven.

01:29.882 --> 01:33.113
Alex doesn't have too
much more time, does he?

01:33.114 --> 01:34.709
Eight and a half years.

01:48.533 --> 01:49.664
In a late-breaking story,

01:49.665 --> 01:53.070
Deputy Mayor Randy St. Clair
arrested this afternoon

01:53.071 --> 01:55.465
on charges of bribery
and corruption.

01:55.466 --> 01:58.195
St. Clair has served as
the mayor's top deputy

01:58.196 --> 02:00.395
since his administration
began. Wow.

02:00.396 --> 02:02.453
Manhattan District
Attorney Charles Rossellini

02:02.454 --> 02:05.671
had little to say to reporters
who tracked him down tonight...

02:05.672 --> 02:06.883
Hey, Mom, can I sleep
over at Charlotte's house

02:06.884 --> 02:08.131
tomorrow night? Shh.

02:08.132 --> 02:09.773
Yeah, I think that's a
question that's, uh,

02:09.774 --> 02:13.043
better directed to Mr. St.
Clair's legal counsel.

02:13.044 --> 02:13.611
But I will say that this

02:13.612 --> 02:14.745
office has no intention
Is that your boss on TV?

02:14.746 --> 02:17.014
of trying this case in the media.
Yeah, that's Mr. Rossellini.

02:17.015 --> 02:18.332
Sorry. I think that

02:18.333 --> 02:20.467
Mr. Sinclair will get
his day in court,

02:20.468 --> 02:22.648
and so will we.
He looks conceited.

02:23.836 --> 02:25.056
So can I?

02:25.057 --> 02:26.529
- It is yet unclear how St. Clair's arrest ...
- No.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.237
will affect the upcoming mayoral election,
Maybe on Friday night.

02:29.238 --> 02:31.858
but considering the position
Randy St. Clair holds

02:31.859 --> 02:33.518
in the current administration...

02:33.519 --> 02:34.838
Are you gonna send
that guy to prison?

02:34.839 --> 02:36.077
...what impact it will have.

02:36.078 --> 02:38.145
That is somebody else's headache.

02:40.738 --> 02:41.996
Politics.

02:42.831 --> 02:43.932
Maybe.

02:43.933 --> 02:44.917
Didn't Rossellini tell you

02:44.918 --> 02:46.393
the mayor was going
to have problems?

02:46.394 --> 02:48.105
He said next year's election.

02:48.106 --> 02:50.078
Yeah, well,
he's ahead of schedule.

03:00.512 --> 03:02.460
I have to run to the ladies'.

03:25.733 --> 03:26.950
Come here.

03:26.951 --> 03:28.936
You are so hot.

03:41.030 --> 03:43.474
You are such a bad boy.

03:43.475 --> 03:45.537
You have no idea.

04:03.783 --> 04:04.893
No!

04:04.894 --> 04:06.055
No!

04:09.464 --> 04:13.186
Mischa! Mischa!

04:14.563 --> 04:16.298
No...

04:31.136 --> 04:32.312
Reagan.

04:34.758 --> 04:36.665
Brighton Beach?

04:39.195 --> 04:40.703
You're kidding me.

04:40.704 --> 04:42.483
Grushenko the mob boss?

04:42.484 --> 04:43.811
His son?

04:46.921 --> 04:47.821
What now?

04:47.822 --> 04:49.140
I don't know.

04:49.141 --> 04:51.893
Guy got killed at his
own engagement party.

05:20.251 --> 05:21.000
JACKIE : Hey.

05:21.001 --> 05:21.819
Sorry I'm late.

05:21.820 --> 05:23.902
A big rig flipped by the Gowanus.

05:23.903 --> 05:24.953
Hey, I was getting
ready to call in

05:24.954 --> 05:26.572
a missing persons on you.

05:26.573 --> 05:28.475
No worries. Victim's still dead.

05:29.365 --> 05:31.669
Three shots from a .38
will do that to you.

05:31.670 --> 05:33.580
Two in the chest,
one in the abdomen.

05:33.581 --> 05:35.076
Single shooter, no shell casings

05:35.077 --> 05:36.376
found on the scene.

05:36.377 --> 05:38.238
What other nuggets you got? Mmm.

05:38.239 --> 05:40.096
How about an eyewitness?

05:40.725 --> 05:42.051
Oh, eyewitness. Come on, Jackie.

05:42.052 --> 05:43.571
It's Brighton Beach.
You know those Russians

05:43.572 --> 05:44.865
look at us like we're the KGB.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.691
So, of course,
nobody saw anything,

05:46.692 --> 05:48.634
nobody heard anything.
Right. What about video?

05:48.635 --> 05:50.862
Owner of the club says he
turned off the security cameras

05:50.863 --> 05:53.229
out of respect for
Grushenko's privacy.

05:53.230 --> 05:54.282
I mean, who takes out

05:54.283 --> 05:56.344
a mob prince at his
engagement party?

05:56.345 --> 05:58.646
Maybe the, uh, caterer
who didn't get the party?

05:58.647 --> 06:00.077
Ooh. Or...

06:00.078 --> 06:02.446
maybe somebody who's
trying to send a message.

06:02.447 --> 06:04.163
More likely. Who's in the box?

06:04.164 --> 06:05.632
Uh, victim's fiancée and her mom.

06:05.633 --> 06:07.506
No eyeballs on them,
maybe we'll get a little profile.

06:07.507 --> 06:08.911
How's the fiancée taking it?

06:08.912 --> 06:10.515
Take a look for yourself.

06:13.543 --> 06:15.260
Ooh... I know her.

06:15.972 --> 06:16.662
What do you mean?

06:16.663 --> 06:17.672
The mom.

06:17.673 --> 06:18.679
I went to high school with her.

06:18.680 --> 06:21.090
Her name is Anna Parnas.

06:21.091 --> 06:22.977
A Russian Roman Catholic.

06:22.978 --> 06:25.128
Yeah, it was either St. Anne's tartan plaid

06:25.129 --> 06:26.637
or a chastity belt.

06:26.638 --> 06:28.247
Well, I'm guessing by
the age of her daughter

06:28.248 --> 06:30.360
it wasn't the chastity
belt that she chose.

06:30.361 --> 06:32.085
What's her story?
You guys friends?

06:32.086 --> 06:33.330
14... we were friends,

06:33.331 --> 06:34.671
15... we were soul mates,

06:34.672 --> 06:36.056
and 16... she was knocked up

06:36.057 --> 06:38.190
by a mob guy. That explains that.

06:38.191 --> 06:40.668
Well, these Russians don't talk;
even the women.

06:40.669 --> 06:43.190
Maybe, since you got a
little history with her,

06:43.191 --> 06:44.133
she might open up to you.

06:44.134 --> 06:45.525
Why don't you take point?

06:48.213 --> 06:48.850
Sir,

06:48.851 --> 06:51.130
the chief of Brooklyn
South is here.

06:51.131 --> 06:52.269
Bring him in.

06:53.292 --> 06:54.579
Commissioner.

06:55.513 --> 06:57.238
Maximilian Grushenko.

06:57.239 --> 06:58.515
We don't know yet the significance

06:58.516 --> 07:00.189
of the event, sir;
if it was a power play,

07:00.190 --> 07:01.871
a message, a personal vendetta.

07:01.872 --> 07:03.707
The man's son was taken out.

07:03.708 --> 07:04.581
Not a single witness

07:04.582 --> 07:06.288
from the party or
the neighborhood.

07:06.289 --> 07:07.436
In Brighton Beach, Baker,

07:07.437 --> 07:09.416
the community brought their
suspicions of the police

07:09.417 --> 07:11.279
with them, when they immigrated

07:11.280 --> 07:12.540
from the Soviet Union.

07:12.541 --> 07:14.107
You have a history
with the father.

07:14.108 --> 07:16.788
When I was deputy chief
of Brooklyn South,

07:16.789 --> 07:18.380
We broke the Russian brigades,

07:18.381 --> 07:19.944
but all we could get on Grushenko

07:19.945 --> 07:21.423
was four years for fraud.

07:21.424 --> 07:24.099
It seems the apple didn't
fall far from the tree.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.219
Young Grushenko traffics
in counterfeit goods,

07:26.220 --> 07:28.960
bootleg cigarettes,
exotic dancers.

07:28.961 --> 07:29.826
And you should know, sir,

07:29.827 --> 07:32.613
your son Daniel's been
assigned the case.

07:32.614 --> 07:34.519
Why should I know that, Bob?

07:34.520 --> 07:35.723
I'm the police commissioner;

07:35.724 --> 07:38.146
I don't assign
detectives to cases.

07:38.147 --> 07:41.183
Have all tours in
the 5-6 extended.

07:41.184 --> 07:42.362
Grushenko will want revenge.

07:42.363 --> 07:44.772
I don't want bodies
piling up in my city.

07:44.773 --> 07:46.037
Yes, sir.

07:55.118 --> 07:56.892
I guess I heard you
were with the police.

07:56.893 --> 07:59.800
And I guess I heard you
married Alex Vayakovsky.

08:02.425 --> 08:04.319
You lost your accent.

08:04.320 --> 08:05.461
Poor little immigrant.

08:05.462 --> 08:06.908
That wasn't for me.

08:10.111 --> 08:10.973
Um... okay, Sophia,

08:10.974 --> 08:12.723
so how long were you
looking for your fiancé

08:12.724 --> 08:14.101
before they found him?

08:14.102 --> 08:15.500
I don't know.

08:16.097 --> 08:17.453
About an hour, maybe.

08:17.454 --> 08:20.666
And do you have any idea
what he was doing back there?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.559
I don't know, and I don't care.

08:24.299 --> 08:27.017
I'm assuming, then,
you know how he was found,

08:27.018 --> 08:30.912
with his, uh... belt undone,
his zipper down?

08:30.913 --> 08:33.306
Girls threw themselves at Mischa.

08:33.307 --> 08:35.897
He was handsome and
rich and cool...

08:35.898 --> 08:37.568
but he loved me.

08:37.568 --> 08:38.779
Okay.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.650
So, then, do you know who
he was back there with?

08:41.652 --> 08:42.910
No.

08:43.946 --> 08:44.777
I'm assuming you know

08:44.778 --> 08:47.445
that Mischa was part
of the family business.

08:47.446 --> 08:49.904
So his murder doesn't count,
because you call him a gangster?

08:49.905 --> 08:51.107
I'm not saying that.

08:51.108 --> 08:52.296
We'll hunt down his killer

08:52.297 --> 08:53.713
just like we would anyone else's,

08:53.714 --> 08:55.098
but that's why I'm asking you.

08:55.099 --> 08:57.910
I need to know who had a
motive to kill Mischa.

08:57.911 --> 08:59.989
Was it a jilted lover,
a business rival...

08:59.990 --> 09:02.115
He was his father's son.

09:02.116 --> 09:03.012
What do you think?

09:03.013 --> 09:04.211
I don't want to talk
about this anymore.

09:04.212 --> 09:05.244
I want to go home.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.083
You know, not to be insensitive

09:07.084 --> 09:10.215
in your time of grief,
but since you had motive...

09:10.216 --> 09:11.936
You think I killed Mischa?

09:11.937 --> 09:12.893
I don't know.

09:12.894 --> 09:14.431
Maybe you followed him,
and saw him

09:14.432 --> 09:15.917
with another woman.
Wouldn't be the first time

09:15.918 --> 09:16.994
in history a woman pulled the...

09:16.995 --> 09:17.785
This is outrageous.

09:17.786 --> 09:20.291
We came here to help,
and now we're being accused?

09:20.292 --> 09:22.052
All I'm saying is you
probably shouldn't leave

09:22.053 --> 09:23.165
the tristate area until

09:23.166 --> 09:24.569
we get this checked out.

09:24.570 --> 09:26.692
You were always
jealous of me, Jackie.

09:26.693 --> 09:29.363
But to take it out on my daughter?

09:32.261 --> 09:33.643
Come on, honey.

09:38.634 --> 09:39.807
That went well.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.409
Good morning, Reagan.

09:49.410 --> 09:50.475
Hello, sir.

09:50.476 --> 09:51.878
Watch any TV last night?

09:51.879 --> 09:53.268
No. The Roller Derby

09:53.269 --> 09:54.823
doesn't come on until the weekend.

09:54.824 --> 09:55.820
That's very funny.

09:55.821 --> 09:57.761
Seriously, how'd I look?

09:57.762 --> 10:00.813
Well, your tie was a
little bold for TV.

10:00.814 --> 10:02.499
Really?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.350
I'm kidding, sir.

10:04.351 --> 10:06.901
This one is no cakewalk.

10:06.902 --> 10:08.423
We were forced to indict St. Clair

10:08.424 --> 10:09.722
a lot sooner than
we would have liked.

10:09.723 --> 10:11.037
Yeah. Why is that?

10:11.038 --> 10:13.979
Well, he recently bought
property in Montenegro,

10:13.980 --> 10:14.593
and we were worried

10:14.594 --> 10:16.472
he was going to flee the country.

10:16.473 --> 10:19.262
Randy St. Clair is
a well-liked guy...

10:19.263 --> 10:21.101
powerful friends in
the mayor's office

10:21.102 --> 10:22.268
and the media.

10:22.269 --> 10:23.576
This is a press case.

10:23.577 --> 10:25.108
We're going to catch
a lot of heat.

10:25.109 --> 10:26.893
Well, comes with the
territory, right?

10:26.894 --> 10:28.992
I'm glad to hear you
say that, Reagan.

10:28.993 --> 10:30.292
Well, Good luck.

10:30.293 --> 10:31.842
I guess you haven't
had your coffee yet.

10:31.843 --> 10:32.977
You're usually quicker
on the uptake.

10:32.978 --> 10:34.894
Excuse me? St. Clair...

10:34.895 --> 10:36.636
He's all yours. Uh, sir,

10:36.637 --> 10:37.862
isn't that...

10:37.863 --> 10:39.262
Kevin Firestone's case?

10:39.263 --> 10:40.695
Firestone's a good man,

10:40.696 --> 10:42.092
dogged investigator,

10:42.093 --> 10:43.658
but I need my top gun on this one.

10:43.659 --> 10:44.682
Sir, I'm flattered,

10:44.683 --> 10:46.427
but it's not fair to Firestone.

10:46.428 --> 10:49.352
I wasn't asking your
opinion, Reagan.

10:49.353 --> 10:50.802
I'll handle Firestone.

10:50.803 --> 10:53.148
You get the files, dig in.

10:56.759 --> 10:58.234
JACKIE: Boris,
you're his best friend.

10:58.235 --> 10:59.500
You don't know anything?

10:59.501 --> 11:02.019
I don't know nobody
have beef with Mischa,

11:02.020 --> 11:03.553
at the party, anywhere else.

11:03.554 --> 11:06.425
Word on the street is, you did
a two-year stint for Mischa,

11:06.426 --> 11:08.559
you're like an adopted
son to his old man.

11:08.560 --> 11:10.327
What you got, some kind of Cain
and Abel thing going on there?

11:10.328 --> 11:12.394
If Grushenko think I harm Mischa,

11:12.395 --> 11:14.565
I already be chopped to pieces.

11:15.512 --> 11:16.908
You see Mischa leave
the party with anyone?

11:16.909 --> 11:22.400
No, and if I did, why I tell you
and not Maximilian Grushenko?

11:22.401 --> 11:25.223
Because you'll be charged
with hindering a prosecution.

11:26.569 --> 11:28.547
What happened to your
finger there, tough guy?

11:35.597 --> 11:37.674
I slam it in a door.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.280
This conversation is over.

11:40.281 --> 11:43.420
Hey. You were the best
man in Mischa's wedding.

11:43.421 --> 11:44.289
You're gonna sit here and tell me

11:44.290 --> 11:46.119
you don't care who his killer is?

11:47.232 --> 11:48.903
We even up on our own.

11:55.374 --> 11:56.990
Don't worry about meal today, kid.

11:56.991 --> 11:58.695
My wife made some fresh lasagna.

11:59.418 --> 12:00.906
Yeah? Yeah.

12:00.907 --> 12:02.775
I'll spring for the sodas.

12:02.776 --> 12:05.151
She makes her own noodles, too.

12:05.152 --> 12:07.012
Makes all the
difference in the world.

12:07.847 --> 12:08.653
You know that?

12:08.654 --> 12:10.021
Nice.

12:10.022 --> 12:13.278
Hey, did you hear about,
uh, Lydia Gonsalves?

12:14.162 --> 12:15.294
Who?

12:15.295 --> 12:16.880
I thought you might know her.

12:16.881 --> 12:18.570
Used to be on the job.

12:18.571 --> 12:21.224
Worked warrants with,
uh, your brother Joe.

12:21.225 --> 12:23.369
Oh, yeah, right.
What happened to her?

12:23.370 --> 12:25.198
Yeah, she ate her gun.

12:29.189 --> 12:31.103
She committed suicide?

12:31.104 --> 12:34.771
Yeah. Shouldn't have pulled
the plug on the job so soon.

12:34.772 --> 12:37.722
Lots of cops get depressed
when they vest out.

12:39.851 --> 12:43.090
This one didn't even wait for
the pension or disability.

12:43.091 --> 12:44.726
It's too bad.

12:44.727 --> 12:46.875
She was young.

12:46.876 --> 12:49.452
Won the Medal for Valor, too.

12:51.968 --> 12:53.805
Hi. Kevin.

12:54.569 --> 12:55.836
I am sorry.

12:55.837 --> 12:57.512
Sure you are.

12:57.513 --> 13:00.126
Do you think I've been
campaigning for this case?

13:00.127 --> 13:02.402
Just don't flatter yourself
that you got this case

13:02.403 --> 13:05.062
because you're some kind
of hotshot trial lawyer.

13:05.063 --> 13:07.353
You're being used.

13:07.354 --> 13:08.393
Okay.

13:08.394 --> 13:11.552
Rossellini gave you this
case because your daddy

13:11.553 --> 13:14.121
is the mayor's
handpicked commissioner.

13:14.903 --> 13:16.750
This way, he insulates
himself from charges

13:16.751 --> 13:20.615
he's going after the mayor...
his political rival,

13:20.616 --> 13:22.171
remember?

13:25.091 --> 13:27.753
You're just Rossellini's tool.

13:35.035 --> 13:36.948
Be still my heart.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.173
For a minute,
I thought it was a customer.

13:39.174 --> 13:41.751
Anna, we're gonna need to ask
you a few more questions.

13:42.486 --> 13:44.193
I'm sorry about the mess.

13:45.091 --> 13:47.070
I had to let the
last of my help go.

13:47.071 --> 13:48.886
Ever since Alex went away,
I have to work constantly

13:48.887 --> 13:50.681
just to keep the
wolf from the door.

13:50.682 --> 13:52.938
Oh, you mean, Grushenko's
not helping you out?

13:53.939 --> 13:57.841
There's no Maximilian Grushenko
Charitable Foundation, no.

13:57.842 --> 14:00.269
Well, your husband... this man...

14:00.270 --> 14:04.021
Alex Vayakovsky's one of
his brigade, isn't he?

14:04.022 --> 14:06.323
Well, I didn't know what that
meant when I married him.

14:06.324 --> 14:08.557
Well, he's doing 20 years to
life for disemboweling a man

14:08.558 --> 14:10.218
who owed him a
little bit of money.

14:10.219 --> 14:11.944
You know what that means?

14:16.436 --> 14:17.165
Every day, I went

14:17.166 --> 14:19.026
to the trial, and every day,
I sat there, and

14:19.027 --> 14:22.637
I listened, and I thought,
how can this be the same man?

14:24.392 --> 14:25.434
Who lived with me,

14:25.435 --> 14:28.517
who played with Sophia,
who took care of us?

14:31.022 --> 14:32.722
You never married?

14:32.723 --> 14:34.735
Uh, for a minute, yeah.

14:35.078 --> 14:37.041
No kids?

14:37.936 --> 14:39.372
You know what. Enough about me.

14:39.373 --> 14:40.942
Let's stick to the topic.

14:40.943 --> 14:43.021
Um, you know anyone who'd
have a motive to kill Mischa?

14:43.022 --> 14:44.724
I thought I killed him.

14:45.718 --> 14:47.900
Sophia, don't be fresh.

14:47.901 --> 14:50.611
Why don't you ask Sergei
Sokolov who killed him?

14:50.612 --> 14:51.765
Impossible.

14:51.766 --> 14:54.636
You know how upset he was
that I was marrying Mischa.

14:54.637 --> 14:56.395
You know those things he said.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.379
Who is this Sergei Sokolov?

14:58.380 --> 14:59.820
Nobody.

14:59.821 --> 15:02.725
He's a sweet boy who
works in a flower shop.

15:02.726 --> 15:04.112
He had a boyhood crush

15:04.113 --> 15:07.011
on Sophia during high school,
that's all.

15:53.309 --> 15:56.210
You called me first, Reagan.

15:57.183 --> 15:58.895
I did, Max.

15:58.896 --> 16:01.808
You want something to drink, eat?

16:01.809 --> 16:02.844
No.

16:04.655 --> 16:07.306
You said it was a private meeting.

16:09.427 --> 16:11.149
He's overprotective.

16:11.150 --> 16:15.139
Oh. So it's an official visit?

16:17.214 --> 16:20.494
It's a condolence call.

16:20.495 --> 16:22.669
New kind of pain.

16:24.788 --> 16:27.261
You lost a son, Reagan.

16:27.262 --> 16:29.696
You understand.

16:29.697 --> 16:32.546
I'm sorry for your loss.

16:33.359 --> 16:37.228
And I'm sorry to see bloodshed
return to Little Odessa.

16:40.327 --> 16:43.738
This was my slip
joint pocketknife.

16:44.859 --> 16:46.812
American elk.

16:49.383 --> 16:52.842
I gave it to Mischa
when he turned 18.

16:55.705 --> 16:58.773
I didn't want it back so soon.

17:00.252 --> 17:02.595
I didn't want it back ever.

17:07.202 --> 17:10.424
Do you remember the last
time we sat together?

17:10.425 --> 17:12.348
Very well.

17:12.349 --> 17:14.289
I did my time.

17:14.290 --> 17:16.788
You should still be there.

17:18.169 --> 17:21.518
You want to find Mischa's killer,
Commissioner?

17:23.247 --> 17:25.409
I'm not stopping you.

17:31.023 --> 17:33.769
Bury your son, Maximilian.

17:33.770 --> 17:35.816
Take time to grieve.

17:37.920 --> 17:40.143
Let us speak for Mischa.

17:40.144 --> 17:44.312
You and your brigade
sit this one out.

18:08.763 --> 18:10.586
Sergei Sokolov?

18:10.587 --> 18:13.735
Long time since cops
came around for me.

18:13.736 --> 18:15.279
Yeah, let's go in and talk.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.508
Yuri?

18:17.509 --> 18:20.807
These detectives
want to talk to me.

18:20.808 --> 18:22.518
I have work to do in the back.

18:22.519 --> 18:25.984
Start putting these wreaths
together for the funeral, okay?

18:25.985 --> 18:26.581
Yeah.

18:26.582 --> 18:28.130
The Grushenko funeral, huh?

18:28.131 --> 18:30.328
Business must be booming.

18:30.329 --> 18:31.977
Mischa was a friend of mine.

18:31.978 --> 18:34.976
Yeah, we know. You used to
run with him back in the day.

18:34.977 --> 18:37.525
Until I figured out
that life wasn't for me.

18:37.526 --> 18:38.517
Yeah, good thing.

18:38.518 --> 18:40.576
You had quite a
record as a juvenile...

18:40.577 --> 18:43.220
vandalism, grand larceny,
assault with a deadly weapon.

18:43.221 --> 18:45.314
I had anger issues.

18:46.350 --> 18:49.426
You know, back in Russia,
my father was an engineer.

18:49.427 --> 18:54.031
Here, the school janitor,
all for a better life for me...

18:55.209 --> 18:57.492
Family Court get me counseling,

18:57.493 --> 18:59.600
anger management.

19:01.442 --> 19:03.382
Helped me turn my life around.

19:03.383 --> 19:05.130
Is that when you and Mischa
stopped becoming friends?

19:05.131 --> 19:08.123
Or was it when he
stole Sophia from you?

19:08.124 --> 19:09.999
That was high school.

19:10.000 --> 19:11.291
It was a long time ago.

19:11.292 --> 19:13.019
Well, delivering all
those floral arrangements

19:13.020 --> 19:15.667
to Sophia's engagement party
must have really frosted you.

19:15.668 --> 19:17.152
I brought the arrangements,

19:17.153 --> 19:20.015
and then I was a guest
like everybody else.

19:20.016 --> 19:22.421
You see Mischa leave
the party with anyone?

19:22.422 --> 19:23.776
I heard about it.

19:23.777 --> 19:26.922
Disgusting he would screw around
at his own engagement party.

19:26.923 --> 19:29.091
He treated her like dirt.

19:30.054 --> 19:31.446
So much for the anger management.

19:31.447 --> 19:32.851
Got to take this.

19:32.852 --> 19:33.970
Yeah?

19:35.373 --> 19:37.267
Hey, Sergei, these
guys friends of yours?

19:37.268 --> 19:39.770
Those Grushenko goons? So what?

19:39.771 --> 19:41.119
So what?

19:41.120 --> 19:42.760
You see, those kind of
guys aren't gonna give you

19:42.761 --> 19:45.495
a Miranda warning first like I would,
that's so what.

19:45.496 --> 19:48.405
I had nothing to
do with-with this.

19:48.406 --> 19:49.641
Right.

19:49.642 --> 19:51.779
I mean, why are we here?

19:51.780 --> 19:53.282
Why are they here?

19:53.283 --> 19:56.007
You may want to change your
mind about cooperating with us.

19:56.008 --> 19:58.186
Otherwise, the next
wreath might be your own.

19:58.187 --> 19:58.986
Correction.

19:58.987 --> 20:03.328
The next wreath goes to the
owner of *Club Tatiana.

20:03.329 --> 20:05.837
Well, he doesn't own
Club Tatiana anymore.

20:05.838 --> 20:07.795
Smells like singed hair.

20:07.796 --> 20:09.919
No wonder. Look at the burn marks.

20:09.920 --> 20:12.135
Somebody must have taken a
welding torch to this guy

20:12.136 --> 20:14.161
before they jammed that
knife in his skull.

20:14.162 --> 20:16.387
Yeah. Grushenko or someone
was looking for answers.

20:16.388 --> 20:17.877
Like the identity of the Madame X

20:17.878 --> 20:19.527
who lured Mischa out
to the storage room?

20:19.528 --> 20:21.220
If there was a Madame X.

20:21.221 --> 20:23.102
Or why he turned off
these security cameras,

20:23.103 --> 20:24.917
because Grushenko
obviously didn't do it

20:24.918 --> 20:26.987
for the privacy of
himself and his guests.

20:28.263 --> 20:31.227
This guy must have been begging
to die before the end of this.

20:31.228 --> 20:33.420
We got to figure out
what this says, Jack.

20:33.421 --> 20:34.148
Oh, yeah.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.691
Uniform said it means,
"Only the first."

20:36.692 --> 20:39.039
Great. Well, who's next? 
Mm-hmm.

20:40.274 --> 20:41.650
You're looking at
prime real estate

20:41.651 --> 20:43.414
in Tribeca waterfront.

20:43.415 --> 20:45.999
Perfect for a 90-story skyscraper.

20:46.000 --> 20:48.019
At least that's what
Dick Meltzer thought.

20:48.020 --> 20:49.330
The developer.

20:49.331 --> 20:51.903
Unfortunately for Meltzer,
that parcel was only zoned

20:51.904 --> 20:55.252
for a five-story mixed commercial,
residential use,

20:55.253 --> 20:58.632
so he needed a heavyweight
to rezone that parcel.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.305
Randy St. Clair,
Deputy Mayor for Development.

21:01.306 --> 21:03.514
So Meltzer throws
these big parties

21:03.515 --> 21:05.749
with St. Clair as
the guest of honor.

21:05.750 --> 21:07.360
What kind of parties?

21:07.361 --> 21:09.415
Parties at the Axium Hotel

21:09.416 --> 21:13.045
with Madam Eva
providing the girls.

21:13.046 --> 21:14.107
Okay.

21:14.108 --> 21:15.586
On June 11,

21:17.111 --> 21:20.094
Meltzer had his henchman
deliver a bag full of cash

21:20.095 --> 21:23.710
to Josh Saunders,
who was St. Clair's top aide.

21:23.711 --> 21:25.173
Meltzer will testify to that?

21:25.174 --> 21:26.937
Yeah, but here's the problem

21:26.938 --> 21:29.028
with Firestone's case.

21:29.029 --> 21:31.305
We have two hookers and a madam

21:31.306 --> 21:33.403
to testify against St. Clair,

21:33.404 --> 21:35.387
a churchgoing father of four

21:35.388 --> 21:37.875
and the mayor's most
trusted associate.

21:37.876 --> 21:41.578
They are going to get destroyed
in the cross-examination.

21:41.579 --> 21:43.046
So we are left with

21:43.047 --> 21:47.007
Josh Saunders,
our cooperating witness.

21:47.008 --> 21:49.114
St. Clair's bagman.

21:49.115 --> 21:50.810
Who worked for him for
three-and-a-half years,

21:50.811 --> 21:53.624
never saw any other illegal
activity the whole time.

21:53.625 --> 21:54.407
This is what we got

21:54.408 --> 21:57.078
for the sweetheart deal
he cut with Firestone?

21:57.079 --> 21:59.140
The highest profile
public corruption case

21:59.141 --> 22:01.198
this office has brought in years,
and guess what?

22:01.199 --> 22:02.320
This case...

22:02.321 --> 22:04.216
It's on life support.

22:05.985 --> 22:07.319
I don't know.

22:07.320 --> 22:10.157
Saunders was willing to bag
money for St. Clair once,

22:10.158 --> 22:12.129
I'm betting he did it plenty.

22:13.153 --> 22:15.502
We need more on Saunders.

22:15.503 --> 22:17.259
He's the key.

22:19.818 --> 22:21.399
He came out of the Gulag.

22:21.400 --> 22:22.717
Tough guy.

22:22.718 --> 22:24.118
But the man I saw...

22:24.119 --> 22:27.224
Nothing prepares you for
the loss of a child.

22:28.255 --> 22:30.432
I read your Fives...
You got a suspect?

22:30.433 --> 22:33.083
Well, I met with one of
Grushenko's chief rivals

22:33.084 --> 22:36.480
in the exotic dancer supply
business, this Albanian.

22:36.481 --> 22:37.838
He pointed out the obvious...

22:37.839 --> 22:38.654
It'd be suicide for any

22:38.655 --> 22:40.920
of those guys to take
out Grushenko's kid.

22:40.921 --> 22:41.964
Which leaves you with...?

22:41.965 --> 22:43.832
Two suspects...
the jealous fiancée...

22:43.833 --> 22:46.394
And the rejected
ex-boyfriend. Yeah.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.406
This club owner, Dad,

22:52.134 --> 22:55.549
you think Grushenko took a
blowtorch to him personally.

22:55.550 --> 22:57.553
That'd be my guess.

22:57.554 --> 23:00.090
And he'd already done
it when I met with him.

23:02.023 --> 23:04.045
I'm gonna get this son of a bitch.

23:05.310 --> 23:07.633
Guys, dinner's on the table.

23:07.634 --> 23:08.810
Okay.

23:12.071 --> 23:14.723
So, Erin, this whole business

23:14.724 --> 23:18.074
with your boss and
Randy St. Clair,

23:18.075 --> 23:20.468
suddenly he dumps it in your lap?

23:20.469 --> 23:22.180
Can we not right now, Grandpa?

23:22.181 --> 23:24.311
St. Clair? That's not Mom's case.

23:24.312 --> 23:26.183
Well, that's not
entirely true, honey.

23:26.184 --> 23:28.155
I thought you said that was
somebody else's headache.

23:28.156 --> 23:29.747
And now it's mine.

23:29.748 --> 23:32.631
How convenient.
He waits for an election year

23:32.632 --> 23:34.116
to get his shorts into a knot

23:34.117 --> 23:36.356
about St. Clair's
alleged shenanigans,

23:36.357 --> 23:39.202
and now a Reagan is lead attorney.

23:39.203 --> 23:41.265
So what, we don't prosecute?

23:41.266 --> 23:43.807
I don't know, the timing is
a little suspicious, sis.

23:43.808 --> 23:45.084
You know, these politicians,

23:45.085 --> 23:46.896
they all got their hands
in the cookie jar.

23:46.897 --> 23:48.463
It's the second oldest
profession in the world.

23:48.464 --> 23:50.664
Yeah, and every cop
is on the take.

23:51.342 --> 23:51.924
You know, when people take

23:51.925 --> 23:54.358
that view of the police department,
we all resent it.

23:54.359 --> 23:55.601
Exactly.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.446
Doesn't this city deserve

23:57.447 --> 24:00.220
to have its business
done honestly?

24:00.994 --> 24:02.533
Yeah, Erin's right... I don't
think the guy should walk.

24:02.534 --> 24:04.297
Nobody's gonna walk.

24:04.298 --> 24:06.696
But you're in the
same administration.

24:06.697 --> 24:09.616
You're tarred with
the same damn brush!

24:10.562 --> 24:14.561
I'm just surprised that a smart
cookie like my granddaughter

24:14.562 --> 24:16.287
lets Rossellini use her that way.

24:16.288 --> 24:17.318
That's enough, Pop.

24:17.319 --> 24:19.463
Dad... Don't tell
me that's enough!

24:19.464 --> 24:21.318
I'll decide when it's enough!

24:21.319 --> 24:22.647
Grandpa!

24:23.513 --> 24:26.621
All right, maybe I
shouldn't have said it...

24:26.622 --> 24:28.355
but it's still true.

24:44.429 --> 24:46.354
Sometimes I think he forgets

24:46.355 --> 24:49.746
that I'm all grown up and
can take care of myself.

24:50.524 --> 24:52.627
He'll calm down.

24:52.628 --> 24:55.807
I understand that
some see it as...

24:55.808 --> 24:57.874
a zero-sum game.

24:59.629 --> 25:03.874
As Rossellini's star rises,
the mayor's falls, and...

25:04.654 --> 25:06.313
that could be bad for you.

25:06.314 --> 25:07.831
Not your problem.

25:11.345 --> 25:13.914
It's a big case, Dad.

25:13.915 --> 25:16.912
I'm not gonna deny
being excited about it.

25:16.913 --> 25:18.439
Hey, I'm proud of you.

25:18.440 --> 25:21.228
You got the highest conviction
rate in the D.A.'s Office.

25:21.229 --> 25:23.762
And yet, Grandpa
thinks I'm being used,

25:23.763 --> 25:25.982
and so do a lot of people.

25:25.983 --> 25:27.894
It's frustrating.

25:29.511 --> 25:32.966
When I was promoted to deputy
chief of Brooklyn South,

25:32.967 --> 25:37.429
my boss called me in his office
and he told me straight out

25:37.430 --> 25:40.640
that he hired me because my dad
was the police commissioner.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.746
And he said he was
bucking for chief of D's

25:43.747 --> 25:46.388
and he expected me to put
in a good word for him.

25:46.389 --> 25:47.535
Did you?

25:48.342 --> 25:49.445
No.

25:50.789 --> 25:53.101
Goes with the family business.

25:53.102 --> 25:55.079
The Reagans are stuck with it.

25:55.080 --> 25:58.085
Dad, you earned every
position you ever got.

25:58.086 --> 25:59.815
So did you.

26:02.167 --> 26:05.815
You were Mr. Randy St.
Clair's private banker.

26:05.816 --> 26:08.225
You were responsible
for transferring

26:08.226 --> 26:11.867
$4.5 million of his money
offshore to the Cayman Islands?

26:11.868 --> 26:14.987
Transferring money
offshore is not illegal.

26:14.988 --> 26:17.337
If Mr. St. Clair
doesn't pay his taxes,

26:17.338 --> 26:19.175
that's his responsibility.

26:19.176 --> 26:20.505
I'm not talking about taxes.

26:20.506 --> 26:22.586
I'm talking about
kickbacks and bribery.

26:22.587 --> 26:26.325
Where our client's money comes
from is not our concern.

26:26.326 --> 26:28.439
How about Josh Saunders' money?

26:28.440 --> 26:31.733
We take the "Private" Part of
"Private banking" Seriously,

26:31.734 --> 26:34.168
so unless you have a subpoena...

26:38.547 --> 26:40.562
I'll have to consult my
attorneys, of course.

26:40.563 --> 26:42.330
You're free to do that.

26:43.956 --> 26:45.279
Are they aware of how many trips

26:45.280 --> 26:48.614
you took to the Caribbean
with Mr. Saunders?

26:49.687 --> 26:51.023
Those were business trips.

26:51.024 --> 26:53.021
Right. Of course they were.

26:53.022 --> 26:55.372
Uh, Saint Kitts, Curacao,

26:55.373 --> 26:57.385
British Virgin Islands.

26:57.386 --> 26:59.651
I see many business meals

26:59.652 --> 27:03.745
and many business suites
shared with Mr. Saunders.

27:03.746 --> 27:07.383
Well, last time I checked,
that wasn't illegal, either.

27:07.384 --> 27:10.108
You're right, it's not.

27:10.109 --> 27:14.137
But what is illegal is
facilitating Mr. Saunders

27:14.138 --> 27:16.525
to extort money from Mr. St. Clair

27:16.526 --> 27:19.017
and to hide said funds
in a dummy foundation

27:19.018 --> 27:21.333
controlled by Mr. Saunders,

27:21.334 --> 27:23.844
and that will get you ten to 15.

27:26.071 --> 27:28.606
It's my suggestion
that cooperation

27:28.607 --> 27:31.626
may be the only card
you have left to play.

27:40.112 --> 27:41.403
What do you want to know?

27:44.551 --> 27:47.774
Sergei, we subpoenaed
your phone records, buddy.

27:47.775 --> 27:49.298
We need to talk to you.

27:49.299 --> 27:50.327
Hey...

27:51.110 --> 27:53.335
Hey, I said we need
to talk to you.

27:54.602 --> 27:56.146
I've got nothing more to say.

27:56.147 --> 27:57.229
You got nothing to say, huh?

27:57.230 --> 27:58.906
You had plenty to say
to Sophia and her mom

27:58.907 --> 28:00.810
on the phone before she
got murdered, didn't you?

28:00.811 --> 28:01.547
What's that all about?

28:01.548 --> 28:03.678
I was trying to stop her
from marrying Mischa.

28:03.679 --> 28:06.547
And believe me, her mother
wasn't trying to discourage me.

28:06.548 --> 28:09.227
But she didn't think
you'd go this far.

28:09.228 --> 28:11.785
I'm not saying another
word without a lawyer.

28:11.786 --> 28:14.198
You know what that says to
us when you lawyer up, right?

28:14.199 --> 28:15.354
It means we're looking
at the right guy.

28:15.355 --> 28:17.612
Just makes us come
after you harder.

28:17.613 --> 28:19.889
Do what you got to do. Hmm?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.033
What I have to do

28:22.034 --> 28:24.104
is deliver these flowers.

28:29.616 --> 28:31.224
Knucklehead.

28:49.818 --> 28:51.128
Sergei Sokolov? Mm-hmm.

28:51.129 --> 28:52.278
Is he still breathing? Well,

28:52.279 --> 28:53.721
apart from the
severity of his burns,

28:53.722 --> 28:54.923
he's got intra-abdominal bleeding

28:54.924 --> 28:56.190
from lacerations to
the liver and spleen

28:56.191 --> 28:58.548
and a cranial hemorrhage
from the concussive blast.

28:58.549 --> 29:00.478
In English... is he gonna make it?

29:00.479 --> 29:02.805
I'm not really optimistic,
Officer.

29:06.088 --> 29:08.202
What's the word? He's likely.

29:12.433 --> 29:13.674
As you were.

29:14.890 --> 29:15.809
Commissioner. Commissioner.

29:15.810 --> 29:17.835
Chief Winston. You both okay?

29:17.836 --> 29:18.772
Yes, sir. We're fine.

29:18.773 --> 29:20.573
And the bombing victim?
You mean the prime suspect

29:20.574 --> 29:23.183
in the murder of Mischa Grushenko,
he's hanging on by a thread.

29:23.184 --> 29:26.188
The techs in Bomb Squad are
analyzing the explosive device.

29:26.189 --> 29:29.582
First impression: sophisticated,
cell-phone-detonated.

29:29.583 --> 29:30.696
Remotely triggered?

29:30.697 --> 29:31.724
Looks that way to them.

29:31.725 --> 29:33.565
That doesn't fit Grushenko's M.O.

29:33.566 --> 29:34.101
Are we gonna be able

29:34.102 --> 29:35.335
to tie this to his
earlier bombings?

29:35.336 --> 29:36.867
Not according to the
Bomb Squad techs.

29:36.868 --> 29:39.152
Those bombs in the '90s
were simple pipe bombs.

29:39.153 --> 29:41.201
This device is next-generation.

29:41.202 --> 29:42.618
So new blood.

29:42.619 --> 29:44.372
New blood, old lions.

29:44.373 --> 29:45.419
Check with lnterpol,

29:45.420 --> 29:47.580
see if any of Grushenko's
brigades qualifies.

29:47.581 --> 29:48.581
Yes, sir.

29:48.582 --> 29:50.530
I want Grushenko for this.

29:50.531 --> 29:52.293
They say his people
have a code of silence.

29:52.294 --> 29:54.922
What they really have
is a code of betrayal.

29:54.923 --> 29:57.018
That's how we got the
brigades the first time,

29:57.019 --> 29:58.744
and that's how we'll
finish them now.

29:58.745 --> 29:59.766
Yes, sir.

29:59.767 --> 30:02.377
No one's turning my
city into Baghdad.

30:03.422 --> 30:05.228
Come in, Mr. Saunders.

30:06.428 --> 30:08.270
Where's Kevin Firestone?

30:08.271 --> 30:10.427
Kevin's moved on.

30:10.428 --> 30:12.556
This is Erin Reagan.

30:12.557 --> 30:14.104
Your cooperation agreement with us

30:14.105 --> 30:15.684
is based on telling the truth...

30:15.685 --> 30:19.050
First with us now,
and then when you take the stand.

30:19.051 --> 30:21.836
Kevin ran that all down for me.

30:21.837 --> 30:24.982
Yeah, that was before he
knew you were extorting money

30:24.983 --> 30:27.065
from your boss, St. Clair.

30:27.066 --> 30:28.333
I don't know what
you're talking about.

30:28.334 --> 30:32.719
No? Chelsea Cole?
The dummy foundation?

30:32.720 --> 30:34.869
St. Clair could hardly
go to the authorities

30:34.870 --> 30:37.924
since you were pilfering money
from his own ill-gotten gains,

30:37.925 --> 30:40.375
but maybe this will
refresh your memory.

30:40.376 --> 30:42.239
$2.3 million

30:42.240 --> 30:44.424
in five separate
offshore accounts.

30:44.425 --> 30:47.244
I guess you thought you and Chelsea
were gonna have a good time

30:47.245 --> 30:50.105
after you served your
token two-year bit.

30:50.853 --> 30:53.292
Your deal with Kevin Firestone,

30:53.293 --> 30:54.527
it's off the table.

30:54.528 --> 30:56.145
Here's the new deal.

30:56.146 --> 31:00.159
You tell us every illegal act
that you and St. Clair committed

31:00.160 --> 31:01.970
while he was in office,

31:01.971 --> 31:05.097
and then we'll decide what
kind of deal you deserve.

31:05.098 --> 31:06.744
If any.

31:08.517 --> 31:10.090
I want my lawyer.

31:10.091 --> 31:13.089
Yeah. Word to the wise:

31:13.090 --> 31:15.511
your friend, Chelsea Cole
will not be waiting for you

31:15.512 --> 31:19.507
outside the Federal penitentiary
when you finally get out.

31:19.508 --> 31:21.346
Anyway, she's already
cut her deal.

31:21.347 --> 31:22.539
Reagan, why don't you
have a couple detectives

31:22.540 --> 31:26.331
come in here and escort Mr.
Saunders into Federal custody.

31:29.373 --> 31:30.616
Wait.

31:31.698 --> 31:33.421
I'll tell you.

31:36.737 --> 31:37.715
All right.

31:37.716 --> 31:38.789
Well, that ought to
be enough pierogies

31:38.790 --> 31:41.046
to at least buy us a
search warrant. Great.

31:41.670 --> 31:42.586
Pierogies? What?

31:42.587 --> 31:44.703
That was intel...
our old friend Boris Litvinenkom?

31:44.704 --> 31:45.531
Oh, from the cafe?

31:45.532 --> 31:46.511
Yeah, Mischa's best man.

31:46.512 --> 31:47.968
Turns out he's a
former Uzbeki rebel

31:47.969 --> 31:50.273
with extensive
bomb-making expertise.

31:50.274 --> 31:51.615
Oh, that explains
the missing finger.

31:51.616 --> 31:53.345
Yeah, it does. Let's roll.

32:00.841 --> 32:02.182
Freeze! Police! Freeze!

32:02.183 --> 32:04.924
Back up! Back up! Get down!

32:04.925 --> 32:06.611
Stay down!

32:06.612 --> 32:08.309
Over here by the desk. Get down!

32:08.310 --> 32:10.348
Get the Bomb Squad in here!
Come on!

32:10.349 --> 32:11.958
Look at this.

32:11.959 --> 32:13.433
We got detonators,
circuit boards...

32:13.434 --> 32:15.183
It's like a Soviet
Fourth of July in here.

32:15.184 --> 32:15.863
What do you want to bet

32:15.864 --> 32:18.299
we find traces of PETN
that match our bomb?

32:18.300 --> 32:19.288
Hey, Boris, how you doing?

32:19.289 --> 32:21.488
Sorry to bust in on you like that.

32:21.489 --> 32:23.061
I have right to remain silent.

32:23.062 --> 32:24.855
Yeah, well, you haven't heard
what I have to say yet.

32:24.856 --> 32:25.958
Perimeter secure!

32:25.959 --> 32:27.261
Reagan, I just spoke to the

32:27.262 --> 32:29.560
doctor regarding Sergei Sokolov...
he's conscious.

32:29.561 --> 32:30.815
Great, let's go see if that
knucklehead's wised up.

32:30.816 --> 32:32.789
Yeah. Throw him in an RMP.

32:33.919 --> 32:37.598
I'll tell you, Sergei,
you're one tough man to kill.

32:37.599 --> 32:39.418
I'm Russian.

32:39.419 --> 32:41.450
Well, too bad you survived
only to learn that

32:41.451 --> 32:45.125
we like you more and more for
the murder of Mischa Grushenko.

32:45.126 --> 32:46.565
N-No...

32:46.566 --> 32:50.546
No? Well, Maximilian Grushenko
thinks you killed his son.

32:50.547 --> 32:51.835
Why shouldn't we?

32:51.836 --> 32:53.089
Because I didn't.

32:53.090 --> 32:55.298
Then who did?

32:56.405 --> 32:58.662
I don't know.

33:00.557 --> 33:02.199
You know, Sergei...

33:03.004 --> 33:04.458
I think you do know a lot more

33:04.459 --> 33:06.169
than you're telling us right now.

33:06.170 --> 33:09.004
I don't know who killed Mischa.

33:09.005 --> 33:10.625
Then what do you know?

33:11.757 --> 33:14.995
I know who took Mischa from party.

33:14.996 --> 33:17.515
Who took Mischa from
the party, Sergei?

33:17.516 --> 33:19.317
Sergei, who took
Mischa from the party?

33:19.318 --> 33:20.589
Come on.

33:20.590 --> 33:23.197
Her name is Svetlana Bayul.

33:23.198 --> 33:24.784
Who is she? Where do we find her?

33:24.785 --> 33:26.068
Dress shop.

33:26.069 --> 33:30.892
She used to work at Anna
Vayakovsky's dress shop.

33:31.921 --> 33:34.014
That's your friend
Anna's dress shop.

33:49.359 --> 33:51.027
We have visitors.

33:52.383 --> 33:53.504
The cops?

33:53.505 --> 33:55.190
What do they want now?

33:56.226 --> 33:57.940
Hello, Detectives.

33:58.791 --> 34:01.861
Uh, my partner here and I believe

34:01.862 --> 34:03.975
we know who killed Mischa.

34:03.976 --> 34:05.222
Sergei Sokolov?

34:05.223 --> 34:06.782
No, darling, it wasn't Sergei.

34:06.783 --> 34:07.932
Sergei was a very nice boy.

34:07.933 --> 34:09.721
He'd never do such a thing.

34:09.722 --> 34:11.128
Who was it then?

34:11.129 --> 34:13.141
You want to tell her, Anna?

34:14.913 --> 34:17.393
Come on, Mom. We know
about the plane ticket

34:17.395 --> 34:19.967
you bought for Svetlana
Bayul back to Kiev.

34:19.967 --> 34:21.467
Her mother was sick.

34:21.469 --> 34:23.702
Okay, and we know about
the $2,000 money order

34:23.703 --> 34:25.623
you sent her on the
day of the murders.

34:25.625 --> 34:29.193
I don't understand. Svetlana who
used to work here killed Mischa?

34:30.635 --> 34:32.139
No, my love.

34:32.139 --> 34:35.337
It was Svetlana who took
Mischa from the party.

34:36.527 --> 34:39.822
Svetlana was expecting I take
a picture of her and Mischa

34:39.824 --> 34:42.728
to show you proof he
was a very bad man.

34:42.728 --> 34:45.909
She wasn't expecting
I'd shoot him.

34:45.909 --> 34:47.815
Shoot him?

34:47.815 --> 34:48.873
Mama,

34:48.873 --> 34:50.856
you?

34:50.857 --> 34:54.386
I tried everything to
make you change your mind.

34:55.100 --> 34:57.928
I didn't want you
following in my footsteps.

34:57.929 --> 34:58.670
So, it's better... her father,

34:58.671 --> 35:00.465
now her mother's in prison,
as well?

35:00.466 --> 35:01.721
There are different
kinds of prison.

35:01.722 --> 35:02.889
I traded one for another,

35:02.890 --> 35:05.516
so that my Sophia
could be set free.

35:07.431 --> 35:08.775
Yeah, good choice.

35:08.776 --> 35:10.754
You have the right
to remain silent.

35:10.755 --> 35:11.471
Anything you say...

35:11.472 --> 35:14.029
Yeah, I know all that.
You can save your breath.

35:14.030 --> 35:15.547
Good. Suit yourself.

35:15.548 --> 35:18.086
This is how much I love you,
Sophia, you understand?

35:18.087 --> 35:19.255
Mother, no, please.

35:19.256 --> 35:21.628
Tell me it's not true!

35:21.629 --> 35:22.839
Mom, please.

35:22.840 --> 35:25.792
We used to eat fries and
drink Cokes after school.

35:25.793 --> 35:28.033
What happened to you?

35:28.034 --> 35:29.704
We were children.

35:31.547 --> 35:32.784
Come on, Mom.

35:42.487 --> 35:44.035
Take her right away.

35:44.036 --> 35:45.857
That leaves Grushenko.

35:47.984 --> 35:50.573
Wait until he tells his
story in open court.

35:50.574 --> 35:52.360
Gonna feel like you
won the Super Bowl.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.705
Well, not that it's
about winning or losing.

35:55.645 --> 35:57.282
Or politics.

35:57.283 --> 35:59.666
Was this a tough sell to the clan?

35:59.667 --> 36:00.924
I thought about that.

36:00.925 --> 36:02.349
I bet you did.

36:03.060 --> 36:06.088
Bet you didn't mind hurting
the mayor one bit, either.

36:06.089 --> 36:08.928
Hey, do you want to live
in a city where the wealthy

36:08.929 --> 36:10.865
and the powerful can
buy their own brand

36:10.866 --> 36:12.161
of justice?

36:13.455 --> 36:14.409
I'm sorry, sir.

36:14.410 --> 36:16.828
I'm tired of being the monkey
in the middle on this one.

36:16.829 --> 36:18.276
I should be going.

36:18.277 --> 36:19.479
Do you want to live in a city

36:19.480 --> 36:22.473
where the district
attorney can buy a drink

36:22.474 --> 36:24.490
for his ace prosecutor?

36:24.491 --> 36:25.771
In theory?

36:25.772 --> 36:28.037
In five minutes.

36:28.038 --> 36:29.989
I'll get my coat.

36:30.963 --> 36:33.592
Think I'm gonna have to get a
little creative with this one.

36:33.593 --> 36:34.842
Yup, do your thing.

36:34.843 --> 36:36.543
You know I will. Hmm.

36:40.990 --> 36:43.270
Make sure no one interrupts me.

36:45.193 --> 36:47.415
What's this? You going
to get heavy with me now?

36:47.416 --> 36:48.640
And do what?

36:48.641 --> 36:50.605
Chop off the rest of
your fingers? Hmm.

36:50.606 --> 36:52.709
Maybe break your arm
in a few places?

36:55.073 --> 36:55.763
The reality is,

36:55.764 --> 36:57.776
if I thought it would make
you give up Grushenko,

36:57.777 --> 36:59.424
I'd be happy to do that.

37:01.170 --> 37:02.526
Give up Grushenko.

37:03.515 --> 37:06.193
Yeah, you're not gonna
give up Grushenko.

37:06.194 --> 37:07.714
I mean, why would you?

37:07.715 --> 37:11.156
Well, here's the thing you don't
seem to understand, Boris,

37:11.157 --> 37:12.844
and what Grushenko
failed to tell you

37:12.845 --> 37:14.810
is that times have changed.

37:14.811 --> 37:16.701
Yeah. And those bombs you make

37:16.702 --> 37:18.803
in that little Boom
Boom Room of yours?

37:18.804 --> 37:21.958
Those are now considered
weapons of mass destruction.

37:21.959 --> 37:23.657
That's Federal.

37:25.782 --> 37:27.038
What you are saying?

37:27.039 --> 37:29.119
It's a capital offense, dumb-dumb.

37:29.897 --> 37:31.700
Death penalty?

37:31.701 --> 37:34.228
Life without parole at best.

37:38.511 --> 37:40.203
You don't get it, do you?

37:41.220 --> 37:44.633
Boris, you're not like
a son to Grushenko.

37:44.634 --> 37:46.625
You're nothing to him.

37:46.626 --> 37:48.493
He doesn't give a damn about you.

37:48.494 --> 37:50.492
And for all he cares,
you're gonna rot

37:50.493 --> 37:52.544
inside of a prison cell
for the rest of your life

37:52.545 --> 37:55.589
for the hit that he
ordered on Sergei.

37:55.590 --> 37:57.804
Yeah.

37:57.805 --> 38:00.737
And if I can tie you to the
hit on the nightclub owner,

38:00.738 --> 38:02.790
guess what?

38:02.791 --> 38:05.649
He's gonna let you take
the hit for that one, too.

38:07.484 --> 38:09.882
When all you really
probably only did

38:09.883 --> 38:11.927
was just hold the guy down

38:11.928 --> 38:14.993
while Grushenko took a blowtorch
to him and stuck a knife

38:14.994 --> 38:17.493
right in the side of his
head and jammed it in...

38:17.494 --> 38:19.271
I don't know what you're talking about.
And jammed it in.

38:19.272 --> 38:20.341
No. I don't. I-I...
And he jammed it in...

38:20.342 --> 38:22.472
right through his skull
and into his brain.

38:22.473 --> 38:24.194
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:24.195 --> 38:25.606
Yes, you do.

38:25.607 --> 38:28.776
But you're not gonna give
up Grushenko, are you?

38:28.777 --> 38:32.078
No. 'Cause you're
like a son to him.

38:32.967 --> 38:34.319
Well, I got news for you, Boris.

38:35.091 --> 38:36.806
You know what Grushenko's
doing right now?

38:36.807 --> 38:38.131
He's probably walking
down the boardwalk

38:38.132 --> 38:40.030
grieving his real son,

38:40.031 --> 38:43.416
and laughing his
ass off about you.

38:43.417 --> 38:45.904
Feds are on their way, tough guy.

38:45.905 --> 38:47.752
Hey, just wait. Wait.

38:47.753 --> 38:49.044
Hey, come on, come back, eh?

38:49.045 --> 38:52.579
Hey, just come-come back.
Hey, just... come...

38:52.580 --> 38:54.218
Come on, I give you
Grushenko, okay?

38:54.219 --> 38:56.558
For the nightclub guy! For...
for everything!

38:56.559 --> 38:58.872
Just come on, come back!

38:58.873 --> 39:00.881
Come back! Hey, come on. Hey! Hey!

39:00.882 --> 39:02.118
I give you entire brigade!

39:02.119 --> 39:04.437
Come. Come on.
Hey, come back. Hey!

39:04.438 --> 39:08.286
Hi, Nicky. I just stopped off
to have a drink with, um...

39:08.287 --> 39:11.613
with a colleague, and, uh,
so have dinner without me.

39:11.614 --> 39:13.820
I'll be home as
soon as I can, okay?

39:13.821 --> 39:15.365
All right. Love you.

39:16.442 --> 39:17.983
How old is your daughter now?

39:17.984 --> 39:20.235
Uh, 14.

39:20.236 --> 39:21.598
It's a great age.

39:21.599 --> 39:23.826
For what?

39:23.827 --> 39:24.504
You're right.

39:24.505 --> 39:25.616
That's a miserable age.

39:25.617 --> 39:27.809
It's all coming back to me now.

39:28.513 --> 39:30.305
I think about that, you know.

39:30.306 --> 39:32.652
Your miserable adolescence?

39:32.653 --> 39:34.984
Life with children,

39:34.985 --> 39:37.237
and what that would be like.

39:37.238 --> 39:39.487
Well, considering you're
a well-known ladies man

39:39.488 --> 39:40.873
and a workaholic, I don't think

39:40.874 --> 39:42.555
you're gonna have to
find out any time soon.

39:42.556 --> 39:44.273
I'm willing to change.

39:44.274 --> 39:45.328
50%.

39:45.329 --> 39:47.579
Which 50%?

39:49.837 --> 39:52.054
I think I'm gonna treat
myself to a cab tonight.

39:52.055 --> 39:54.452
Nonsense. I'll drop you off.

39:54.453 --> 39:55.559
It's really not necessary.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.003
I insist. Look,
I'm parked right up the block.

40:00.585 --> 40:02.999
It really got colder since
we went in there, didn't it?

40:03.000 --> 40:04.712
Yeah. Here.

40:04.713 --> 40:07.034
Oh, no. You said you
were right down the...

40:07.035 --> 40:08.930
Street.

40:20.740 --> 40:23.289
I didn't ask for that.

40:23.290 --> 40:25.589
You didn't?

42:01.849 --> 42:04.063
Not bad. Nailed Grushenko.

42:04.064 --> 42:05.461
I'm sorry about Anna.

42:05.462 --> 42:08.707
Sacrificed her whole
life for her kids.

42:11.351 --> 42:13.108
Hope it's worth it.

42:14.905 --> 42:17.455
Yeah, I know it's
twisted logic, but...

42:19.402 --> 42:20.154
I don't know.

42:20.155 --> 42:21.934
Kind of makes sense to me.

42:21.935 --> 42:23.159
Is that crazy?

42:23.160 --> 42:26.227
No. Makes sense.

42:26.228 --> 42:29.315
In some dark, gloomy,
Russian kind of way.

42:29.316 --> 42:30.448
Yeah.
