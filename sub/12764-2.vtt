00:01.033 --> 00:02.960
<i>Previously on Kyle XY...</i>

00:03.040 --> 00:04.067
Then no good-byes.

00:04.147 --> 00:06.603
- Just like "See ya."
- See ya.

00:06.701 --> 00:08.299
You've proven you can keep my secrets.

00:08.398 --> 00:11.288
If there was anything to tell,
don't you think I'd bring you in on it?

00:11.371 --> 00:12.380
I'm Adam Baylin.

00:12.466 --> 00:15.538
You're saying I was gestated
inside one of those tanks at Zzyzx.

00:15.624 --> 00:17.358
- So you created me.
- Yes.

00:17.444 --> 00:20.261
You have to condition yourself,
or you're gonna die too young

00:20.347 --> 00:21.917
before you've even had a chance to live.

00:21.997 --> 00:23.189
This is Brian Taylor.

00:23.269 --> 00:25.082
- Nice to meet you.
- You as well.

00:25.194 --> 00:26.765
I've heard a lot about you.

00:33.665 --> 00:37.416
- He's been shot!
- Zzyzx will kill him. I'll go tonight

00:37.771 --> 00:39.713
- and eliminate the threat.
- You'll do nothing.

00:39.799 --> 00:41.376
You'll harm no one.

00:43.529 --> 00:45.386
- They're innocent!
- They're not innocent!

00:45.484 --> 00:48.039
They killed Baylin and they'll kill you!

00:50.929 --> 00:53.363
Kyle, you can't go back to the Tragers.

00:53.461 --> 00:56.793
I lied so that I could leave,
and now I'll lie so that I can return.

00:56.929 --> 00:59.560
I'll do everything in my
power to live by the truth.

00:59.695 --> 01:01.691
Why do you wanna go back,
complicate your life?

01:01.790 --> 01:03.780
It's not complicated. It's simple.

01:03.867 --> 01:04.983
I love them.

01:18.108 --> 01:19.497
- Oh, Kyle...
- This is great.

01:19.583 --> 01:21.160
It's so good to see you again.

01:21.277 --> 01:23.625
- How long can you stay?
- What are you doing here?

01:23.738 --> 01:25.278
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

01:25.372 --> 01:26.843
Did your parents come with you?

01:26.938 --> 01:30.053
Let's give this guy a chance
to catch his breath here.

01:30.171 --> 01:31.189
Are you okay?

01:31.284 --> 01:33.849
I'll never forget that
look on their faces,

01:33.971 --> 01:35.603
the joy and relief.

01:35.732 --> 01:37.492
They seemed so happy to see me.

01:38.666 --> 01:41.448
I wanted to tell them the truth
about everything that had happened,

01:42.168 --> 01:44.329
but I wanted to be at home
with them even more.

01:45.423 --> 01:46.974
Is that your folks?

01:47.077 --> 01:49.708
And that meant playing
my part in the charade.

01:55.382 --> 01:56.840
- Mr. Trager?
- Yes.

01:56.934 --> 01:58.411
My name's Brian Taylor.

01:58.505 --> 02:00.663
I'm the attorney for
David and Julia Peterson.

02:01.647 --> 02:02.709
Attorney?

02:04.658 --> 02:07.192
- Well, come on in.
- Thank you.

02:09.693 --> 02:11.719
Is everything all right?

02:15.681 --> 02:18.746
I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but

02:18.861 --> 02:21.877
David and Julia were killed
in a car accident last week.

02:22.065 --> 02:23.068
My God.

03:15.169 --> 03:16.797
What are you doing?

03:20.339 --> 03:21.493
Thank you.

03:22.535 --> 03:24.749
It's not even my birthday.

03:26.864 --> 03:27.943
The hell?

03:28.505 --> 03:30.054
No belly button?

03:30.526 --> 03:32.989
No, no, no. Don't be scared, sweetheart.

03:33.476 --> 03:35.179
We can be friends.

03:45.023 --> 03:46.421
You want some?

03:46.709 --> 03:47.731
Here.

03:47.844 --> 03:48.924
Warm you up.

03:49.103 --> 03:50.105
Go on.

03:50.238 --> 03:51.998
There. Yeah.

03:57.761 --> 03:59.636
That wasn't very nice.

04:00.146 --> 04:02.133
Now, you gotta be nice.

04:29.129 --> 04:30.624
You wanna play?

04:32.083 --> 04:33.086
Let's play.

04:45.126 --> 04:46.792
Give me the knife.

04:48.778 --> 04:50.160
Give it to me!

04:59.140 --> 05:00.711
Why you little...

06:28.303 --> 06:29.533
Get me Hollander.

06:30.763 --> 06:33.848
According to the police report,
David lost control of the car and it

06:34.027 --> 06:35.422
plunged into a canyon.

06:36.332 --> 06:38.542
The gas tank was punctured and the...

06:38.694 --> 06:41.865
- car caught fire.
- Oh, that's horrible.

06:42.836 --> 06:45.940
But for the grace of God, Noah decided
to sleep in that morning.

06:46.035 --> 06:50.081
Otherwise, we would be having
a far more difficult conversation.

06:50.687 --> 06:52.485
And you say this happened a week ago?

06:52.939 --> 06:54.190
That's right.

06:55.381 --> 06:58.353
Well, I'm just surprised that Kyle...

06:58.485 --> 07:01.269
Sorry, we'll still not used
to his real name.

07:01.382 --> 07:02.575
Oh, I understand.

07:04.051 --> 07:06.012
Why didn't he contact us sooner?

07:07.145 --> 07:09.322
Well, he missed you terribly.

07:10.212 --> 07:11.877
And to be honest, I...

07:12.010 --> 07:13.943
Well I had to insist
that he come here at all.

07:14.038 --> 07:16.862
He was rather reluctant to involve you
and your family again.

07:16.975 --> 07:17.980
Why?

07:18.874 --> 07:21.561
He felt that he'd already
been enough of a burden.

07:21.675 --> 07:23.745
Kyle's never been a burden.

07:23.859 --> 07:25.845
I'm glad to hear you say that.

07:25.959 --> 07:30.036
See, Julia and David named you
as his permanent guardians.

07:30.623 --> 07:32.175
His... guardians?

07:35.898 --> 07:38.352
It's not that we don't want Kyle.

07:39.391 --> 07:41.037
We went through so much

07:41.151 --> 07:42.943
when we lost him the first time.

07:43.037 --> 07:46.710
If he stays here and another relative
comes to take him away again...

07:46.805 --> 07:49.417
There are no other relatives,
Mr. and Mrs. Trager.

07:53.612 --> 07:55.230
It's a lot to take in.

07:55.334 --> 07:57.321
I understand. You need time to think.

07:57.946 --> 08:00.553
We're staying at a
hotel near the airport.

08:00.651 --> 08:02.955
Would it be all right
if he spent the night here?

08:03.666 --> 08:06.265
I'm... I'm sure he'd like
that very much.

08:08.064 --> 08:10.487
I'm planning on leaving
town tomorrow evening.

08:10.581 --> 08:12.285
Really the only question
for me is whether

08:12.379 --> 08:14.590
I'm buying one plane ticket or two.

08:21.538 --> 08:23.620
Mom was having a symbolic moment.

08:24.699 --> 08:26.746
A way of letting you go.

08:27.865 --> 08:28.868
Well,

08:29.095 --> 08:31.140
I always knew you'd be back.

08:32.975 --> 08:33.979
You did?

08:35.375 --> 08:36.908
Not like this...

08:37.626 --> 08:38.706
but, yeah.

08:52.005 --> 08:53.747
Kyle, are you okay?

08:54.447 --> 08:55.507
I mean...

08:55.904 --> 08:58.070
I'm sorry. I know that sounds lame.

08:58.541 --> 08:59.544
No.

09:01.191 --> 09:02.630
I don't know what else to say.

09:04.541 --> 09:06.605
You don't have to say anything.

09:09.666 --> 09:11.019
So, is it weird

09:11.218 --> 09:12.751
being back here?

09:13.868 --> 09:14.947
A little.

09:21.594 --> 09:22.597
There.

09:22.701 --> 09:23.969
That's better.

09:25.315 --> 09:26.772
Glad to see it?

09:29.071 --> 09:30.085
Very.

09:38.742 --> 09:40.881
Welcome, Emily Hollander.

09:55.090 --> 09:57.231
Ms. Hollander, you've handled some...

09:57.345 --> 10:00.043
unusual assignments for us before.

10:00.173 --> 10:01.402
I like unusual.

10:01.501 --> 10:03.331
This case is no exception.

10:04.044 --> 10:05.977
In fact, it's a highly sensitive matter

10:06.057 --> 10:08.005
that requires the utmost discretion.

10:08.287 --> 10:09.958
Well, now I'm intrigued.

10:12.365 --> 10:14.662
Madacorp is like an iceberg.

10:15.399 --> 10:18.117
Most of its interests lie
beneath the surface.

10:18.916 --> 10:20.904
As did Zzyzx,

10:20.984 --> 10:23.005
one of our research facilities.

10:23.786 --> 10:27.451
I say "did" because Zzyzx
was fire bombed this week.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.063
By whom?

10:29.891 --> 10:32.574
That's unclear at the moment,
but there is a...

10:33.321 --> 10:35.236
much more pressing concern.

10:40.341 --> 10:42.888
Zzyzx experimented
with artificial reproduction

10:42.989 --> 10:45.116
and produced two primary assets.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.507
The first was a male called "XY."

10:49.913 --> 10:53.046
He was terminated sometime
last year for reasons unknown.

10:53.193 --> 10:56.446
The second is a female, XX.

10:57.042 --> 10:59.398
She apparently survived the bombing

10:59.545 --> 11:00.713
and escaped.

11:01.672 --> 11:02.717
Escaped?

11:03.756 --> 11:06.560
I take it the subject
has outgrown her petri dish.

11:07.420 --> 11:08.898
She's fully-developed.

11:09.240 --> 11:11.162
Human, yet not human.

11:12.171 --> 11:14.150
She's had no contact
with the outside world.

11:14.236 --> 11:17.457
Consider her dangerous,
unpredictable, and disoriented.

11:17.642 --> 11:20.894
She's likely still wandering
around the woods near Victor Falls.

11:20.992 --> 11:23.169
And I assume
that you don't want her to go camping.

11:23.255 --> 11:24.629
I want her here.

11:24.734 --> 11:26.794
There's no telling what she might do
and we can't

11:26.965 --> 11:29.640
risk any exposure to the company.

11:31.374 --> 11:33.427
Shouldn't be too much
of a challenge for you.

11:33.537 --> 11:35.691
I know what you accomplished in Iraq.

11:37.292 --> 11:39.370
I'll find her for you, sir.

11:43.190 --> 11:44.797
I wish you'd let us know.

11:44.883 --> 11:47.400
We would've flown out there
to be with you.

11:47.772 --> 11:49.590
Everything happened so fast.

11:49.949 --> 11:51.618
Well, you're here with us now.

11:52.100 --> 11:53.421
It's okay, you know?

11:53.501 --> 11:55.232
It's normal if you...

11:55.367 --> 11:57.998
feel some anger
or a sense of injustice...

11:58.539 --> 11:59.634
Injustice?

11:59.978 --> 12:02.929
You finally reunited
with your parents and...

12:06.866 --> 12:09.691
Things don't always turn out
like you expect them to.

12:13.757 --> 12:15.559
Well, you need anything else?

12:16.845 --> 12:17.989
No.

12:23.705 --> 12:24.886
Thank you.

12:26.096 --> 12:27.136
Sure.

12:31.530 --> 12:33.209
It's so good to see you again.

12:35.772 --> 12:36.943
Good night.

12:45.844 --> 12:49.661
I couldn't help but think back to
the last night I'd spent in this room.

12:49.997 --> 12:52.318
It was the beginning of my secret life,

12:52.806 --> 12:54.699
before I left with the Petersons.

12:54.873 --> 12:58.262
And now I was home,
hiding even more secrets.

13:01.040 --> 13:04.238
I could only hope
that whatever fate had in store for me,

13:04.421 --> 13:07.539
it would be kind and forgiving
to the people I loved.

13:16.264 --> 13:17.579
What a day.

13:18.935 --> 13:20.370
I'm exhausted.

13:21.331 --> 13:23.385
It's just so hard to believe.

13:23.520 --> 13:26.422
I know.
You kept sensing something was wrong.

13:26.530 --> 13:28.789
I never dreamed of anything like this.

13:33.001 --> 13:35.231
You're not feeling guilty are you?

13:37.665 --> 13:40.329
I can tell you're happy
that Kyle's home...

13:40.714 --> 13:42.510
miserable about the reason.

13:42.596 --> 13:44.779
When did you become
the psychologist in the family?

13:45.268 --> 13:46.808
I learn by osmosis.

13:48.603 --> 13:50.427
I missed Kyle so much...

13:50.853 --> 13:52.698
and I'm thrilled that he's here, but...

13:52.784 --> 13:54.822
I don't want to lose him again.

13:55.433 --> 13:56.982
You heard the lawyer.

13:57.097 --> 14:00.338
Yeah, there are no relatives
that he knows about.

14:00.720 --> 14:03.204
I mean, there's still so much
that we don't know.

14:04.478 --> 14:07.282
What about those years
when Kyle was missing?

14:07.393 --> 14:09.114
We still don't know
what happened to him then.

14:09.200 --> 14:10.532
Yeah, well...

14:10.617 --> 14:13.150
I guess we're always going
to have questions.

14:14.356 --> 14:17.774
The only one we could answer
right now is, do we want him to be...

14:17.885 --> 14:19.188
part of our family?

15:14.709 --> 15:18.482
Okay, just remember, Kyle's been
through a lot, so be extra sensitive.

15:19.623 --> 15:21.566
- Why you looking at me?
- Cause you're such

15:21.652 --> 15:23.551
a model of tact and compassion.

15:24.284 --> 15:26.054
Fine. I won't speak.

15:26.137 --> 15:27.479
Can we have that in writing?

15:27.578 --> 15:30.411
Guys, stop.
The point is Kyle needs our support.

15:30.510 --> 15:31.684
But don't press him.

15:31.788 --> 15:34.727
Let him deal with this in his own time
in his own way.

15:38.477 --> 15:40.479
- Good morning.
- Morning!

15:41.588 --> 15:44.244
- Sleep okay?
- I haven't slept so well in days.

15:45.068 --> 15:47.939
Nothing beats a cold slab of porcelain.

15:49.114 --> 15:50.121
Sorry.

15:50.815 --> 15:52.982
- Are you hungry?
- I'll make pancakes.

15:53.154 --> 15:54.752
I missed your pancakes.

15:54.876 --> 15:56.401
I think we're out of syrup.

15:56.576 --> 15:59.446
- Who finished the syrup?
- I didn't know we were rationing.

15:59.560 --> 16:01.493
- It's okay.
- I'll go get some more.

16:01.651 --> 16:02.806
No, wait.

16:04.149 --> 16:05.951
You don't have to be so nice.

16:06.888 --> 16:08.231
Just be yourselves.

16:09.941 --> 16:11.132
You know what I mean.

16:12.292 --> 16:16.048
You're all trying to make me feel better
and I appreciate it, but the truth is...

16:16.244 --> 16:17.697
just being here is enough.

16:23.535 --> 16:24.715
Excuse me.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.654
- Hello?
- How did it go?

16:28.334 --> 16:29.341
Fine.

16:29.646 --> 16:32.090
- Are they there right now?
- Yes.

16:34.406 --> 16:35.930
We need to talk.

16:36.582 --> 16:38.602
So meet me later like we agreed.

16:39.644 --> 16:41.464
Okay, I will, good-bye.

16:42.202 --> 16:43.823
Was that Mr. Taylor?

16:45.625 --> 16:46.632
Cool phone.

16:47.038 --> 16:49.664
- You know, I could use a new one.
- Good. Go buy one.

16:50.061 --> 16:51.167
- Seriously?
- Sure.

16:51.253 --> 16:53.675
Just as soon as you get
that after-school job to pay for it.

16:53.841 --> 16:55.795
Check the job board at The Rack.

16:56.253 --> 16:57.810
I'm meeting Declan there for lunch.

16:57.963 --> 16:59.001
How is Declan?

16:59.796 --> 17:01.720
An eternal ray of sunshine.

17:02.086 --> 17:03.216
He's in a gunk.

17:03.857 --> 17:04.865
A what?

17:05.053 --> 17:07.526
A guy funk. Totally gender-specific.

17:07.862 --> 17:10.395
You should come with.
Maybe you can shake him out of it.

17:10.548 --> 17:13.234
If a guy funk is a gunk,
then what's a girl funk?

17:14.029 --> 17:15.097
Redundant.

17:26.473 --> 17:28.492
It's Hollander. I found our girl.

17:29.150 --> 17:31.134
Or at least what she left behind.

17:31.745 --> 17:32.905
Where are you?

17:33.025 --> 17:35.528
In the woods, east of the Zzyzx complex.

17:35.833 --> 17:37.677
How long ago since she was there?

17:37.763 --> 17:41.147
By the looks of things, it couldn't
have been more than four or five hours.

17:41.244 --> 17:43.940
Is there anything
I should be concerned about?

17:46.552 --> 17:49.727
Not unless you count the dead guy
covered in pink goo.

17:51.936 --> 17:53.141
Clean it off.

17:53.233 --> 17:55.987
So nothing can be traced back
to the company.

17:56.079 --> 17:57.305
What the...

17:58.405 --> 17:59.444
What is it?

18:00.592 --> 18:01.687
Hold on.

18:11.858 --> 18:14.237
She must be exceptionally strong.

18:14.322 --> 18:16.060
You forgot to mention that.

18:16.722 --> 18:19.654
As I told you, I have no idea
what she's capable of.

18:21.279 --> 18:23.227
Find her before she kills again.

18:23.380 --> 18:24.570
Is that clear?

18:25.330 --> 18:26.368
Crystal.

18:44.847 --> 18:46.125
What's the trick?

18:46.654 --> 18:49.397
Once you teach your mind to alter
the positive and negative polarity

18:49.495 --> 18:51.529
of the cells in your body...
The glass will move.

18:51.613 --> 18:53.965
Not the glass. The water inside it.

18:59.224 --> 19:00.598
What are you doing?

19:00.964 --> 19:02.094
Oh, hey, Josh.

19:03.351 --> 19:06.247
- Why were you zoning out like that?
- Was I?

19:06.658 --> 19:08.687
You were staring at that glass.

19:09.176 --> 19:10.306
I was thirsty.

19:10.875 --> 19:11.893
Right.

19:13.176 --> 19:15.923
Come on, did you learn some new tricks
while you were away?

19:16.372 --> 19:17.654
I don't do tricks.

19:18.583 --> 19:20.922
You forget I kept records, okay?

19:21.442 --> 19:23.514
And I'd be more than happy
to bust out that file

19:23.612 --> 19:26.326
if you've got something new
you want to show me.

19:27.288 --> 19:29.078
Okay, I do have something.

19:29.566 --> 19:32.162
But we have to concentrate really hard
if we want it to work.

19:32.284 --> 19:33.413
Absolutely.

19:33.994 --> 19:35.215
Face the glass.

19:36.009 --> 19:37.842
- Close your eyes.
- Close my eyes?

19:37.986 --> 19:39.207
Do you want it to work?

19:51.451 --> 19:52.581
Open them.

19:53.161 --> 19:54.932
I made the water disappear.

20:04.601 --> 20:05.916
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:07.132 --> 20:08.386
Welcome back.

20:09.973 --> 20:11.265
It's good to see you.

20:13.000 --> 20:14.524
You don't look any different.

20:14.770 --> 20:16.459
You don't look like you're in a gunk.

20:17.353 --> 20:18.460
A gunk?

20:20.269 --> 20:21.692
Lori thinks I'm depressed.

20:21.772 --> 20:22.650
Are you?

20:23.171 --> 20:24.203
No...

20:24.671 --> 20:26.535
but you've had me
freaked out and worried.

20:26.621 --> 20:27.904
There's no reason to be.

20:28.342 --> 20:30.409
Right, because being
the keeper of your secret code

20:30.489 --> 20:33.169
and good-bye message
shouldn't have given me any anxiety.

20:33.279 --> 20:35.148
You should forget about that box.

20:35.443 --> 20:36.796
Forget it?

20:37.424 --> 20:39.440
It's been torturing me for months.

20:40.815 --> 20:42.040
Everything's fine now.

20:42.327 --> 20:43.884
No, everything's not fine.

20:44.066 --> 20:45.588
Come on, you can't come back out of

20:45.668 --> 20:48.007
nowhere and not tell me what happened.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.100
Sorry, I have to be somewhere right now.

20:52.263 --> 20:53.305
Where?

20:53.625 --> 20:55.014
I just gotta go.

20:57.854 --> 20:59.207
Not cool, Kyle.

21:00.006 --> 21:01.481
After everything?

21:02.497 --> 21:04.120
Just not cool!

21:24.779 --> 21:26.389
What is she wearing?

21:40.119 --> 21:41.853
Come on, now.

21:42.357 --> 21:43.623
We need to go.

22:17.079 --> 22:18.087
Get the ball.

22:36.999 --> 22:38.400
Can I have my ball back?

23:30.229 --> 23:32.209
I appreciate you seeing me.

23:33.119 --> 23:34.373
It's my pleasure.

23:34.459 --> 23:36.734
I understand you've got a very
weighty decision to make.

23:36.833 --> 23:38.382
No, we love Kyle.

23:38.480 --> 23:41.350
I mean, that's not the issue.
It's just that...

23:41.437 --> 23:44.054
he left here with
so many questions unanswered.

23:44.134 --> 23:46.947
Well, I'll do my best
to answer them for you.

23:48.159 --> 23:51.024
That five-year period when Kyle was lost

23:51.110 --> 23:52.951
and the Petersons were looking for him,

23:53.031 --> 23:54.599
he couldn't remember any of it.

23:55.128 --> 23:58.853
Well, he did through therapy
in Connecticut.

24:01.828 --> 24:03.413
He was abducted

24:03.493 --> 24:05.322
by a man named Adam Baylin.

24:06.293 --> 24:07.905
Adam Baylin, that was the...

24:07.985 --> 24:11.007
name of the grad student
who looked like Kyle.

24:12.003 --> 24:13.327
Apparently,

24:13.426 --> 24:14.656
Noah...

24:14.755 --> 24:17.668
bore a striking resemblance
to Baylin's dead son.

24:18.812 --> 24:20.078
He kidnapped him.

24:21.161 --> 24:22.534
Clearly deluded, he...

24:22.614 --> 24:25.574
raised him as his own
for the next five years.

24:25.919 --> 24:27.824
Now, the good news, if there can be any

24:27.910 --> 24:31.196
in these circumstances,
is that he treated him very well.

24:32.158 --> 24:34.741
Noah said that they spent
most of their time together with

24:34.821 --> 24:36.183
him teaching him.

24:36.859 --> 24:38.740
Teaching him? Teaching him what?

24:39.146 --> 24:41.697
Mathematics, physics.

24:42.275 --> 24:44.045
Baylin was a scholar.

24:44.144 --> 24:45.169
And as you know,

24:45.268 --> 24:47.470
Noah's very talented in those areas.

24:48.539 --> 24:51.820
How did Kyle end up wandering
in the woods that day?

24:54.656 --> 24:56.808
Baylin was a very tortured soul.

24:59.648 --> 25:01.136
He took his own life,

25:01.222 --> 25:02.473
leaving Noah...

25:02.553 --> 25:03.709
alone,

25:03.807 --> 25:04.975
distraught.

25:06.684 --> 25:08.676
Eventually, he just wandered off.

25:08.762 --> 25:10.962
I believe that's where you came in.

25:16.638 --> 25:19.320
Noah has come to terms with this.

25:20.303 --> 25:23.221
He wants to put the past
to rest and move forward.

25:23.848 --> 25:25.496
My hope is that he can do that

25:25.582 --> 25:27.537
with the love and support
of your family.

25:34.685 --> 25:38.131
Female Caucasian, hair black,
blood-stained shirt only.

25:38.217 --> 25:40.356
Behavior erratic, considered dangerous.

25:40.438 --> 25:42.983
Sighted on MacGowan,
north of Juniper Park.

26:04.286 --> 26:05.392
You made it.

26:07.435 --> 26:08.824
What's all this?

26:09.549 --> 26:11.185
Baylin's belongings.

26:11.750 --> 26:13.595
His journals and his books,

26:13.681 --> 26:14.972
his research.

26:15.538 --> 26:18.148
You'll understand it better than I can.

26:20.521 --> 26:22.574
How'd it go with the Tragers?

26:23.000 --> 26:24.124
It's hard...

26:24.592 --> 26:26.602
not telling them the truth.

26:29.159 --> 26:30.561
I'm going to tell Declan.

26:30.647 --> 26:32.073
No, you're not.

26:32.455 --> 26:34.583
I need to. He already
knows a lot of the story.

26:36.095 --> 26:37.300
How?

26:38.050 --> 26:40.730
Before I left, he was helping me.

26:41.087 --> 26:43.066
There was no one else who understood.

26:43.263 --> 26:44.812
What, and now...

26:45.684 --> 26:47.765
And now you're back
and he's asking questions?

26:47.845 --> 26:50.368
- I can explain it to him.
- No, you can't.

26:51.198 --> 26:53.323
For the same reason you can't
explain to the Tragers.

26:53.403 --> 26:56.307
- He already knows more than they do.
- Well, that's your mistake!

26:56.985 --> 26:58.768
What were you thinking?

27:00.637 --> 27:02.982
He's my friend. I can trust him.

27:03.062 --> 27:05.366
You're the one who said
you wanted to come back!

27:05.480 --> 27:07.803
You said you understood the way
things were going to work.

27:07.939 --> 27:10.112
There are consequences
for my decision. I know that.

27:10.192 --> 27:11.578
But you obviously don't!

27:11.668 --> 27:13.659
Because the only logical move
is to shut him out.

27:13.739 --> 27:15.912
I need someone I can talk to.

27:15.999 --> 27:18.134
Then you know what?
Go ahead. Tell him...

27:18.214 --> 27:19.815
Tell him everything.

27:20.134 --> 27:21.413
Tell him all.

27:21.972 --> 27:24.185
Tell him about the experiments

27:24.517 --> 27:27.161
and the murders and the lies
that you've been perpetrating.

27:27.241 --> 27:28.752
We'll wait and see how long it takes

27:28.838 --> 27:31.343
before somebody else
catches wind of who you are

27:31.423 --> 27:33.782
and what you can do
and drags you out of there!

27:33.868 --> 27:35.582
Is that what you want?

27:46.759 --> 27:48.062
That's... That's...

27:48.259 --> 27:49.624
what we're here to explore.

27:51.173 --> 27:53.800
And that's why you can't explain,
because that...

27:54.477 --> 27:56.444
that is unexplainable.

29:06.052 --> 29:07.945
This smoothie has chunks.

29:08.031 --> 29:10.361
Chunks are good. They add texture.

29:10.988 --> 29:13.620
- Hey, is that your...
- My Kyle file?

29:14.112 --> 29:15.274
Still that alien trip?

29:15.354 --> 29:17.491
Not unless he does something
notebook-worthy again,

29:17.589 --> 29:19.446
which, thus far, nada.

29:19.532 --> 29:20.881
His parents just died.

29:20.961 --> 29:22.999
I don't think his mission
is to amaze you.

29:23.085 --> 29:24.425
He could throw me a bone...

29:24.524 --> 29:27.006
start speaking in tongues,
run a two-minute mile,

29:27.117 --> 29:29.333
predict a tsunami or something.

29:29.652 --> 29:32.014
He's only been back a day.
Give him time.

29:32.678 --> 29:34.811
I just hope Kyle is still...

29:35.647 --> 29:36.901
Kyle.

29:40.547 --> 29:41.580
Hey.

29:41.924 --> 29:43.055
- Hi.
- Hey.

29:43.682 --> 29:45.428
How's the job search going?

29:45.563 --> 29:48.711
I still haven't found
my ideal work situation.

29:48.819 --> 29:49.926
Which is?

29:50.749 --> 29:54.155
Sitting around, eye-groping
unattainable cheerleaders.

29:54.407 --> 29:55.894
Which he does here.

29:59.761 --> 30:00.806
Here.

30:04.488 --> 30:05.567
You're a genius.

30:05.647 --> 30:08.463
Please. I don't even think
you could work a blender.

30:08.862 --> 30:10.307
Yo, you're hiring?

30:29.527 --> 30:31.177
Anything interesting?

30:33.290 --> 30:35.726
Oh, my God!
Kyle, what are you doing here?

30:36.013 --> 30:37.618
I'm meeting Josh and Lori.

30:37.716 --> 30:39.955
No, I don't mean here.
I mean here as in in town.

30:40.077 --> 30:41.576
I got in last night.

30:41.821 --> 30:43.709
I can't believe it.
How long are you staying?

30:43.826 --> 30:45.458
Still trying to figure that out.

30:45.584 --> 30:48.478
Well, make it as long as possible.
We've got so much to catch up on.

30:48.637 --> 30:50.387
Well, let's catch up now.

30:50.546 --> 30:52.008
I can't. I'm waiting for Charlie.

30:53.322 --> 30:54.380
Charlie?

30:54.459 --> 30:56.900
Yeah, you know, tall, dark,
perpetually late boyfriend?

30:58.090 --> 31:00.826
- You're still together.
- Yeah, why wouldn't we be?

31:04.534 --> 31:06.634
Anyhow, can we catch up later?

31:06.929 --> 31:08.404
How about tonight?

31:08.918 --> 31:11.338
We're going to a concert.
Believe me, I'd love to bail,

31:11.448 --> 31:14.879
but Charlie waited in line for,
like, two days to get the tickets.

31:15.038 --> 31:16.811
But promise me you'll find time.

31:17.890 --> 31:18.903
I promise.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.142
Then I know it'll happen.

31:28.076 --> 31:29.692
I'm so glad you're here.

31:29.979 --> 31:31.024
Me, too.

32:13.446 --> 32:14.491
Hello?

32:17.755 --> 32:20.574
I'm not here to hurt you.
Do you understand?

32:21.556 --> 32:23.391
I'm here to take you home.

32:28.182 --> 32:29.226
Okay,

32:29.599 --> 32:32.362
I'm coming in now.
Don't do anything crazy.

32:33.729 --> 32:35.900
Anything crazier than this.

32:36.976 --> 32:38.021
All right.

32:46.943 --> 32:48.041
It's okay.

32:52.344 --> 32:53.551
Easy, now.

32:58.424 --> 32:59.564
You're okay.

33:01.652 --> 33:03.395
God, you're just a kid.

33:06.039 --> 33:07.232
Hi.

33:07.861 --> 33:09.192
My name's Emily.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.073
That's it. Don't be afraid.

33:14.418 --> 33:16.255
I'm here to help you.

33:17.363 --> 33:18.534
I'm your friend.

33:21.447 --> 33:23.602
You like the light? Yeah.

33:27.293 --> 33:29.273
You're just going to go
to sleep for a while.

34:02.986 --> 34:05.658
- Ballantine.
- It's Hollander. I've got her.

34:05.745 --> 34:08.197
- Where are you?
- We're in a dockyard

34:08.295 --> 34:10.643
about six miles west
of the interstate on Route 16

34:10.743 --> 34:13.251
in a shipping container
near the back fence.

34:13.344 --> 34:14.849
Well, bring her in.

34:14.992 --> 34:18.922
Yeah, there's something here you're
going to want to see for yourself.

34:26.312 --> 34:27.685
Kidnapped?

34:28.592 --> 34:29.637
I know.

34:29.985 --> 34:32.043
- It's tough to hear.
- It's horrible.

34:32.485 --> 34:34.449
His amnesia helped protect him

34:34.576 --> 34:37.204
until he was ready
to deal with the experience.

34:37.978 --> 34:40.795
Fortunately, Kyle seems
to have made peace with it.

34:41.303 --> 34:43.283
Josh? You okay?

34:45.114 --> 34:46.781
Yeah, but a kidnapping.

34:47.710 --> 34:49.226
It's just so...

34:50.257 --> 34:51.426
ordinary.

34:52.645 --> 34:54.831
Yeah, it's great that Kyle's okay,

34:55.347 --> 34:58.802
but this completely blows my alien
abduction theory out of the water.

34:59.081 --> 35:01.202
There is something
seriously wrong with you.

35:01.288 --> 35:03.641
Look, we just wanted you both to know

35:03.747 --> 35:06.010
everything before we make
our final decision.

35:06.110 --> 35:09.689
When Kyle first came here, everything
about him was a mystery and

35:09.857 --> 35:11.345
now it's all clear.

35:11.725 --> 35:13.339
And what we're left with is a boy.

35:14.068 --> 35:17.772
A remarkable boy who has no one else
in the world but us.

35:19.105 --> 35:22.086
And once we sign those custody papers,
he'll be one of us.

35:22.492 --> 35:23.664
Here to stay.

35:23.885 --> 35:25.437
Of course you should sign.

35:29.603 --> 35:30.925
Kyle's still the man.

35:32.635 --> 35:33.882
Even if he is ordinary.

35:44.863 --> 35:46.067
Tough day?

35:47.301 --> 35:48.916
What are you doing here?

35:49.330 --> 35:51.354
Listen, man, I get
that whatever you have to say

35:51.453 --> 35:53.715
is gonna be a little off
the chart of normal,

35:53.875 --> 35:55.362
but I can take it.

35:55.717 --> 35:57.681
I really can't talk about that.

35:58.322 --> 36:00.760
- Why?
- Because I don't want to lie to you.

36:01.108 --> 36:04.084
- Well, then, tell me the truth.
- That's not possible.

36:05.446 --> 36:07.549
I don't understand any of this.

36:08.743 --> 36:11.180
That guy Tom Foss hid
cameras in this house.

36:11.338 --> 36:13.460
Someone came after you with a gun, Kyle.

36:13.618 --> 36:14.947
It's all been taken care of.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.481
What are you... What are you
talking about? By who?

36:19.850 --> 36:22.834
Do you have any idea what I've had
to deal with, keeping your secret?

36:23.847 --> 36:25.653
I've been lying to Lori for months,

36:25.751 --> 36:27.838
I can't focus, my grades are screwed,

36:28.474 --> 36:29.931
my dad is all over me...

36:30.691 --> 36:32.685
the only thing
that's kept me remotely sane

36:32.812 --> 36:35.724
was knowing that one day you would
tell me what the hell you got me into

36:35.844 --> 36:37.655
and it would all be worth it.

36:38.450 --> 36:41.549
Look me in the eye
and tell me all of it was for nothing.

36:45.126 --> 36:46.678
It wasn't for nothing.

36:48.135 --> 36:49.781
And I can't say any more.

37:13.094 --> 37:14.392
Our girl's been busy.

37:16.857 --> 37:19.107
They offer art classes at Zzyzx?

37:25.799 --> 37:29.927
Must be all the people that she came
into contact within the last 48 hours.

37:31.626 --> 37:32.682
Can't be.

37:34.395 --> 37:35.408
Who is he?

37:36.516 --> 37:37.941
The other asset.

37:39.556 --> 37:40.672
XY?

37:42.029 --> 37:44.119
Thought you said he was terminated.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.467
That's what I was led to believe.

37:47.856 --> 37:50.155
But if she saw him out there...

37:52.958 --> 37:55.179
Your next assignment, Ms. Hollander...

37:56.224 --> 37:57.395
has just begun.

38:10.972 --> 38:12.644
- Boy, I'm starving.
- That looks good.

38:17.132 --> 38:18.831
I didn't hear you come in.

38:19.566 --> 38:20.705
Everything all right?

38:23.935 --> 38:26.686
I know my coming back here
hasn't been easy.

38:28.337 --> 38:31.123
The last thing I want to do
is make trouble for you.

38:32.421 --> 38:34.952
You never brought anything
but love into this house.

38:39.465 --> 38:41.587
Would you like to tell us something?

38:46.374 --> 38:47.419
Noah.

38:47.894 --> 38:49.445
We know about Adam Baylin.

38:51.119 --> 38:52.132
You do?

38:53.348 --> 38:55.160
Mr. Taylor told me everything.

38:55.604 --> 38:57.937
And we understand
you want to move on, so

38:58.248 --> 39:01.649
we'll just take our cue from you, okay?

39:03.712 --> 39:04.726
Okay.

39:05.964 --> 39:09.351
And we'd like to sign those custody
papers and make it official.

39:10.174 --> 39:11.219
Thank you.

39:13.689 --> 39:16.239
Can we make one more thing official?

39:17.001 --> 39:18.194
What's that?

39:20.259 --> 39:21.857
My legal name is Noah...

39:23.124 --> 39:25.011
but I'll never be anybody but Kyle.

39:27.962 --> 39:29.534
My name is Kyle.

39:31.497 --> 39:32.876
We'll take care of it.

39:38.448 --> 39:40.088
They believed our story.

39:41.164 --> 39:42.716
This is your home now.

39:44.648 --> 39:46.706
They think Adam Baylin abducted me.

39:47.624 --> 39:48.868
Another lie.

39:49.064 --> 39:50.077
My lie.

39:52.040 --> 39:53.716
I had to put the puzzle together

39:53.790 --> 39:55.880
so that they could put the puzzle away.

39:57.355 --> 39:59.987
I hope I did the right thing
coming back here.

40:00.795 --> 40:03.201
You have what Adam always wanted...

40:03.297 --> 40:04.311
a family.

40:05.736 --> 40:10.137
Adam may no longer be here,
but his dream still lives in you.

40:12.371 --> 40:13.868
He believed that

40:13.985 --> 40:17.627
you could be a shining light
in a world full of darkness.

40:18.323 --> 40:19.368
So do I.

40:20.853 --> 40:22.638
The question now is...

40:23.259 --> 40:24.986
can you believe in yourself?

40:27.850 --> 40:28.863
I can.

40:30.780 --> 40:33.669
But the secrets that put me here
are the last I'm willing to keep.

40:35.072 --> 40:37.665
Well, then, you're already
a better man than most.

40:40.050 --> 40:41.538
Adam wanted me to give you this.

40:42.837 --> 40:44.832
- What is it?
- I don't know.

41:02.902 --> 41:03.901
It's a ring.

41:06.161 --> 41:07.384
It's beautiful.

41:09.646 --> 41:10.651
What's the symbol?

41:12.494 --> 41:13.915
Never seen it before.

41:22.359 --> 41:23.477
When Taylor left,

41:23.576 --> 41:26.341
I hoped that the lies
I had to tell left with him,

41:26.453 --> 41:27.830
and that from then on,

41:27.940 --> 41:30.903
I could live safely and honestly
with my family.

41:33.830 --> 41:35.882
Kyle, come on. I'm starving.

41:36.005 --> 41:38.304
You'd better sit before things get ugly.

41:43.269 --> 41:45.162
So, here we are.

41:47.135 --> 41:48.243
Here we are.

41:49.066 --> 41:50.238
Back to normal.

41:51.757 --> 41:52.960
Too normal.

41:53.423 --> 41:54.436
Josh.

41:55.299 --> 41:56.455
Let's eat.

42:01.782 --> 42:03.303
Phone's about to ring.

42:05.811 --> 42:08.358
The phone... it's about to ring.

42:13.236 --> 42:14.501
How did you do that?

42:16.929 --> 42:18.227
I'll tell you how.

42:19.082 --> 42:20.096
He's Kyle.

42:28.508 --> 42:31.547
- Nobody phones Josh.
- It's probably for you anyway.

42:32.256 --> 42:33.841
They'll call back later.
