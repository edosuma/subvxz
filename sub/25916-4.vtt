00:10.010 --> 00:11.553
[man] <i>Hey!</i>

00:35.410 --> 00:37.328
[grunts] You sure this is safe?

00:37.412 --> 00:39.914
Yeah, the princess is almost never here.

00:39.998 --> 00:42.792
You know, we could've just made out
at the donkey auction.

00:42.876 --> 00:46.838
Yeah, but where's the thrill of that?
I mean, don't you like it dangerous?

00:46.921 --> 00:48.923
Have you ever made out
in front of donkeys?

00:49.007 --> 00:51.468
Yeah, they get real judgey. [chuckles]

00:52.260 --> 00:54.971
Holy crap, you're Princess Tiabeanie!

00:55.055 --> 01:01.061
No, I'm just a normal teenager,
high on bread mold, breaking into castles.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.729
Then why is there a portrait of you?

01:02.812 --> 01:05.732
[chuckling] What are you, an art critic?
Shut up.

01:05.815 --> 01:08.818
Sorry, Bean. I heard guys
that go with you end up dead. Who'd you hear that from?
Get out of here, scribe guy.

01:11.988 --> 01:15.784
"Embarrassed yet unbowed,
the scrivener made his egress.

01:15.867 --> 01:19.829
But he would continue to listen outside
the door, unbeknownst to the princess."

01:19.913 --> 01:22.207
Look, uh, maybe I'll see you sometime.

01:22.290 --> 01:23.750
[Bean] Fine, coward.

01:23.833 --> 01:26.711
Your hands were all rough
and sexy, anyway.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.381
Go! Go use them on yourself or whatever.

01:30.465 --> 01:31.299
[Luci] Fun night?

01:31.382 --> 01:33.968
[sighs] I just want to do
what everybody else does, but I can't if they're all so scared
of my stupid dad.

01:36.721 --> 01:39.432
Luci, you're my personal demon.
What do you think I should do?

01:39.516 --> 01:42.060
Eh, easy. Kill Zog, hollow out his corpse

01:42.143 --> 01:45.271
and wear it around from time to time,
so people think he's still alive.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.107
-[man screaming]
-It's a perfect crime.

01:47.190 --> 01:51.027
Bean, you doing anything weird in here
I should know about?

01:51.111 --> 01:53.738
Yeah, just making murder plans
with my cat.

01:53.822 --> 01:56.157
Oh, that's nice.
Good night, honey.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.786
Oh, my God, it's always just gonna be
me and my cat, isn't it?

02:05.458 --> 02:08.169
Our secret society meets tonight?

02:08.253 --> 02:13.383
-No, not until the king leaves the castle.
-The elf. Speak only in code.

02:13.466 --> 02:19.305
We won't convene the cookie club
until the asswipe leaves the castle.

02:19.973 --> 02:24.018
I couldn't help but overhear
your secret conversation. Mind if I join?

02:24.102 --> 02:26.437
-Yes. Yes, we do.
-[door opens]

02:26.521 --> 02:30.316
Hey, Sorcerio,
how's that elf blood comin' along?

02:30.400 --> 02:31.818
I'm not getting any younger.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.070
Oh, you will soon, my sire.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.446
Hi, asswipe.

02:35.530 --> 02:36.573
[grunts]

02:36.656 --> 02:41.119
Don't worry, my liege. His lack of blood
has put him in a delirious state.

02:41.202 --> 02:42.829
We'll give him a sedative.

02:42.912 --> 02:45.582
Hand me ten ccs of brick.

02:47.083 --> 02:48.084
-[blow lands]
-[Elfo thuds]

02:53.631 --> 02:57.010
I love living where I work.
I never have to leave.

02:57.093 --> 03:00.430
And I never have to work.
And people have to do what I say.

03:00.513 --> 03:02.390
More corn. More gravy.

03:03.016 --> 03:05.685
Bean, you ever see
a guy eat a whole chicken?

03:05.768 --> 03:07.312
Yes, yesterday, you.

03:07.395 --> 03:09.105
Oh, right. [chuckles]

03:09.189 --> 03:10.273
[clears throat]

03:10.356 --> 03:13.735
These bones are getting caught
in my throat. Fetch me some water.

03:14.485 --> 03:16.446
I know I don't hydrate
as much as I should,

03:16.529 --> 03:18.615
but is this what water's
supposed to look like?

03:18.698 --> 03:21.075
It's fresh from the local well, sire.

03:21.159 --> 03:22.160
[flies buzzing]

03:23.411 --> 03:25.580
I've already summoned the plumber.

03:25.663 --> 03:29.000
Good. I'd like to tell him
I'm disappointed in his work.

03:29.083 --> 03:31.502
I'm disappointed in your work. Thank you! That's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me!

03:37.592 --> 03:40.845
Trying to get me to drink this water
like I'm some kinda idiot.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.639
What is this, my first rodeo?

03:42.722 --> 03:44.515
What's a rodeo?
What were we talking about?

03:44.599 --> 03:45.558
Man, I'm thirsty.

03:47.810 --> 03:49.812
[groaning]

03:50.897 --> 03:53.483
Oh, I'm dying over here.

03:55.652 --> 03:59.739
Oh, why did I behead everyone
with a medical license?

03:59.822 --> 04:03.493
We take Zoggy to a spa
where I get waited on hand and foot.

04:03.576 --> 04:06.913
Stay as long as you can,
even if it takes the whole weekend.

04:06.996 --> 04:09.624
People rarely recover
before Saturday night.

04:09.707 --> 04:13.920
Okay. But there better not be
any funny business while I'm gone.

04:14.003 --> 04:15.755
You can count on me, sire.

04:15.838 --> 04:20.260
And the rest of you, too.
[groans] Odval, you're in charge.

04:20.343 --> 04:23.054
Keep your eyes on Bean
and her weird friends.

04:25.139 --> 04:29.352
Oh, neat. I'm gonna name them
Winky, Blinky and Soul-Stealer.

04:29.435 --> 04:31.521
Please don't name my eyes.

04:31.604 --> 04:36.150
Hey, little guy, if I find so much
as a misplaced hair when I get back,

04:36.234 --> 04:37.902
I'll cut off your arm.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.405
Okay, but not my lucky arm.

04:40.488 --> 04:42.073
Which one's your lucky arm?

04:42.865 --> 04:44.784
Okay, fine, both of them.

04:44.867 --> 04:45.785
[Elfo] Mmm.

04:46.369 --> 04:47.620
Come on. Go.

04:50.581 --> 04:53.960
Don't let the drawbridge
hit your ass on the way out. Ow!

04:54.043 --> 04:55.211
The king may be ill,

04:55.295 --> 04:59.590
but we mustn't let this grave occurrence
weigh down our somber hearts.

04:59.674 --> 05:03.094
We must carry on
and take comfort in prayer...

05:03.761 --> 05:05.346
[laughing]

05:05.430 --> 05:09.058
Oh, I've got to keep it together
until he's out of the gates, at least.

05:09.851 --> 05:10.935
[Elfo and Bean cheer]

05:11.019 --> 05:13.604
[all cheering]

05:13.688 --> 05:16.899
[sighs] Them's good people.

05:24.198 --> 05:28.369
Okay, the one thing I do know is
when your parents are out of town,

05:28.453 --> 05:29.746
that's when the fun begins.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.790
Now, if I was a normal kid,
what would I do?

05:32.874 --> 05:34.625
Mmm, throw a party.

05:34.709 --> 05:37.045
Man, I have wanted to throw one of those

05:37.128 --> 05:39.380
ever since they were invented
five years ago.

05:39.464 --> 05:43.051
Wait. What are you guys doing?
Zog said he'd cut off my arms. Sure, he said it. Did he mean it?
We'll find out.

05:46.804 --> 05:49.599
Come on, man.
Parties are where heroes are born.

05:49.682 --> 05:53.394
Deals are made, wallets are lost,
people hook up.

05:53.478 --> 05:56.189
[whispers] Often the most
regrettable hookups.

05:56.272 --> 06:00.985
[chuckles] Oh. That's cool. That's cool.
I can be somebody's regret.

06:01.069 --> 06:02.945
[chuckles and clears throat]

06:03.029 --> 06:05.823
Yes! Okay, do you guys realize
what's happening?

06:05.907 --> 06:09.452
For one night,
we get to do whatever we want.

06:09.535 --> 06:12.372
[gasps] I'm gonna drink flaming grog
from a baby skull.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.999
I'm gonna drink milk out of my shoe.

06:17.710 --> 06:19.587
I already had milk in there.

06:24.258 --> 06:27.136

06:29.222 --> 06:31.724
Hey, welcome to the spa. I'm Chazz.

06:31.808 --> 06:34.811
I'll be doing all your body butters
and light touching.

06:34.894 --> 06:36.437
What are these clamps for?

06:36.521 --> 06:40.149
To hold you down while I talk to you.
Now let me ask you a few questions.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.693
-Does it hurt when I poke you like this?
-Ow!

06:42.777 --> 06:46.906
Good, good. Now, how does it feel
when I slap your belly like this?

06:46.989 --> 06:47.990
Ow!

06:48.074 --> 06:50.243
Okay, last question.

06:50.326 --> 06:52.578
Have you ever been clamped down
naked on a slab

06:52.662 --> 06:54.622
by a lunatic who doesn't work for the spa?

06:54.705 --> 06:56.582
What the hell?

06:56.666 --> 07:00.128
Don't rattle the clamps.
It enrages me.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.131
Okay, first up, guest list.

07:03.214 --> 07:06.342
No Dreamland dudes.
They're too scared of Zog.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.177
Also, they're kinda plague-y and I just...

07:08.261 --> 07:11.222
I can't deal with lips falling off
when I kiss people right now.

07:11.305 --> 07:15.226
Oh. Sounds like Bean may prefer
a mysterious stranger

07:15.309 --> 07:19.313
with olive skin and an unbridled
sense of caution. [chuckles]

07:19.397 --> 07:20.731
Bean, do you prefer Elfo?

07:20.815 --> 07:22.817
That's not what I meant.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.153
But do you?
Don't answer unless it's yes.

07:25.236 --> 07:29.031
Dude, decide what you want, drink till
you have the nerve to go for it,

07:29.115 --> 07:32.410
then keep drinking so the inevitable
rejection doesn't hurt so bad.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.327
What do you want?

07:33.411 --> 07:37.248
I guess I've always wanted
to watch the sunrise with a girl I fancy.

07:37.331 --> 07:40.793
Ugh. Just say Bean.
You want to watch the sunrise with Bean.

07:40.877 --> 07:42.670
Well, stop saying what I mean.

07:42.753 --> 07:46.591
Hear ye, hear ye!
Where are my party people at?

07:46.674 --> 07:49.760
There shall be, tonight at the castle,
a wicked rager,

07:49.844 --> 07:53.431
open to any in the kingdom
who know how to rage wickedly.

08:01.189 --> 08:02.857
[turkeys clucking]

08:07.320 --> 08:10.990
Party tonight. But don't tell anyone.

08:11.073 --> 08:13.075
[fairies laughing]

08:23.252 --> 08:25.880
You guys have a band?
I didn't know you were interesting.

08:25.963 --> 08:28.216
Right now we mostly play corn exchanges,

08:28.299 --> 08:30.551
but a lot of times, people look up
from what they're doing.

08:30.635 --> 08:33.262
Wow, maybe someday
you guys will play Cornchella.

08:33.346 --> 08:37.058
[chuckles] Oh. Hey, guys.
Has the party started or is the kingdom's most eligible bachelor
already here?

08:40.937 --> 08:43.814
I don't know. Has literally anyone
other than you arrived?

08:43.898 --> 08:48.611
Aw, I think he looks cute,
like the mayor of Babyville.

08:48.694 --> 08:52.573
Why do you always have to compare me
to a cute baby? I'm a cute man.

08:52.657 --> 08:54.408
Aw, yes, you are.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.411
[laughing] That's enough. Stop.

08:59.956 --> 09:01.082
That's enough!

09:08.172 --> 09:09.882
Wow, lights.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.717
Okay, boys.

09:11.801 --> 09:15.846
Let's make this night so legendary,
they caution children about it.

09:15.930 --> 09:17.557
Lower the drawbridge!

09:22.353 --> 09:23.521
[Elfo] What the hell?

09:24.105 --> 09:28.067
Uh, yeah, lower the giant painting
of the countryside.

10:09.442 --> 10:13.613
Hey, so,
you gonna ask me to dance or what, huh?

10:13.696 --> 10:17.408
Dance? Why, I'd be delighted.
I love to dance.

10:18.117 --> 10:20.745
Whoa! You're King Zog's daughter.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.496
It's cool, man. He's out of town, so--

10:22.580 --> 10:25.291
Actually, sorry, I'm late for a crusade.

10:26.667 --> 10:29.211
I love to dance. Watch this.

No, me neither.

11:00.785 --> 11:01.702
[laughs]

11:01.786 --> 11:03.996
I don't either. I hate dancing.

11:04.580 --> 11:06.582
[laughs] Do you wanna dance?

11:06.666 --> 11:08.918
It would... It'd be crazy
if we danced right now, right?

11:14.882 --> 11:18.344
[scoffs] Look at all those fools dancing.
It would be so...

11:18.427 --> 11:21.430
It would be so stupid
for us to join them, right?

11:25.017 --> 11:28.604
Almost everyone's dancing.
[chuckles] I mean...

11:28.688 --> 11:34.026
would... would you...
Would you wanna do that as well?

[Elfo] 312, 313...

11:42.326 --> 11:44.328
You're missing your chance, dude.

11:44.412 --> 11:46.997
Oh, great, now you made me lose count.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.541
This is your moment.

11:48.624 --> 11:51.669
She's standing there alone.
You're all fueled up on cheese.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.212
Make your move, stupid!

11:53.295 --> 11:55.214
You're right. I'm gonna march up to Bean

11:55.297 --> 11:59.009
and say something I'll have figured out
by the time I get there.

12:09.395 --> 12:11.605
Hey, you can't park on my lawn.

12:11.689 --> 12:13.774
My flaming arrow says I can.

12:13.858 --> 12:16.026
You've got a talking flaming arrow?

12:16.110 --> 12:19.113
What? No, it's just a regular arrow.

12:19.196 --> 12:20.322
Well, I'm sorry.

12:20.406 --> 12:24.118
Things get confusing in a world
with occasional magic and curses.

12:24.201 --> 12:25.745
And while I am a fan of such worlds,

12:25.828 --> 12:28.122
I just feel
some more clearly set out rules

12:28.205 --> 12:31.125
for what can and cannot happen
would help us-- [grunts]

12:33.461 --> 12:36.046
He says it's okay to park here.

12:37.715 --> 12:41.677
Whoa! Elfo. [chuckles]
Would you look at us, huh?

12:41.761 --> 12:46.557
Couple of wallflowers, standing over
by the snack table eating chee...

12:46.640 --> 12:51.812
What happened to all the cheese?
There were over 300 cubes over here.

12:51.896 --> 12:54.899
[clears throat] Bean, Bean, Bean.
[chuckles]

12:54.982 --> 12:58.903
-Um, well, can I be honest with you?
-Yeah, of course.

12:58.986 --> 13:05.201
When I left Elfwood, I had no idea why,
but then, here, tonight,

13:05.284 --> 13:07.912
I feel like I finally know why.

13:07.995 --> 13:10.581
Um... Uh... [groans]

13:10.664 --> 13:13.626
[chuckling] I don't know how to say this.
Ugh!

Go ahead. Say it.

-I'm into big girls.
-What?

13:18.130 --> 13:19.590
Just hear me out.

13:19.673 --> 13:25.179
Before I left, I didn't have any idea
that my size, my stature, was...

13:25.262 --> 13:26.388
What do you call it?

13:26.472 --> 13:28.307
-Dinky?
-What?

13:28.390 --> 13:31.185
[stuttering] I don't if I'd say "dinky."

13:31.268 --> 13:36.649
I guess what I'm trying to get at,
and not so eloquently, but...

13:36.732 --> 13:40.820
could you ever go out with a guy
who's dinky?

13:40.903 --> 13:45.658
Well, I have been drinking a lot tonight,
so it might just be the grog talking,

13:45.741 --> 13:48.202
but, you know, I think maybe I--

13:48.285 --> 13:50.830
Oh, God, Vikings! [screams]

13:51.497 --> 13:55.209
Let's burn this place down!

13:55.292 --> 13:56.627
[all gasp]

13:56.710 --> 13:59.171
With our smooth northern dance style.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.136
[groaning]

14:06.220 --> 14:09.974
You still seem tense. Chazz is gonna
take it down a notch, okay?

14:10.057 --> 14:12.101
Just me and you.

14:12.184 --> 14:15.104
Just Chazz and the king,
havin' a dialogue.

14:15.187 --> 14:17.356
You know,
I thought about being a king once.

14:17.439 --> 14:20.192
Just wasn't born that way.
Those are the breaks.

14:20.276 --> 14:22.611
[laughing]

14:22.695 --> 14:26.699
Oh, would you listen to me.
Woe is Chazz, huh?

14:26.782 --> 14:28.993
Woe is gonna be you if you don't--

14:29.076 --> 14:30.327
[shushing]

14:30.411 --> 14:32.204
We all get to share our feelings.

14:32.288 --> 14:34.999
-This here is the feeling stick.
-[stick rattles]

14:35.082 --> 14:38.127
Whoever holds the stick
gets to share their feelings.

14:38.210 --> 14:41.422
I'm feelin' furious! I'm gonna--

14:41.505 --> 14:43.507
Bup, bup, bup. Who has the stick?

14:43.591 --> 14:45.634
[grunts] Chazz has the stick.

14:45.718 --> 14:48.721
He sure does.
And how do you feel about that?

14:48.804 --> 14:52.057
Ha! Chazzed.
Only I can share the feelings.

14:52.141 --> 14:54.310
-But seriously, I was a chubby kid...
-[groaning]

14:54.393 --> 14:57.646
...and even though I knew
I was destined for greatness,

14:57.730 --> 15:02.484
the flab on my arms said different.
Poor Chazz.

15:04.570 --> 15:06.655
Oh, no. Party crashers!

15:06.739 --> 15:10.242
Uh, night's over!
Tell your parents to pick you up.

15:10.326 --> 15:12.411
Hey, chill out. This is Bean's party.

15:12.494 --> 15:16.206
Whoo! Horse at a party!
Party horse rules!

15:16.290 --> 15:19.877
Hey, nice. She drank her way
out of depression like a pro.

15:19.960 --> 15:21.879
Stupid lucky horse.

15:23.422 --> 15:27.718
-[horse neighs]
-Whoa! Easy, girl. [neighs]

15:30.220 --> 15:33.307
The horse has big, beautiful teeth.
Like you.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.268
-Your tooth is beautiful, too.
-Ah.

15:41.523 --> 15:43.984
Um, please don't sit in the king's chair.

15:44.068 --> 15:46.654
It's for his royal ass only. Thank you.

15:46.737 --> 15:49.698
Ha! Kings! I fear no kings.

15:49.782 --> 15:53.953
Queens either. Dukes kinda
give me the willies, but kings? Bah!

15:54.536 --> 15:58.415
Hi. You seem unafraid of kings
and probably have other qualities.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.751
I am also funny guy...

16:01.627 --> 16:03.420
because inside there is pain.

16:03.504 --> 16:04.838
Welcome to my party.

16:04.922 --> 16:09.343
So this is your castle? You're not like
some stuck up princess, are you?

16:09.426 --> 16:13.472
Did I say my party?
I meant thy party.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.307
I'm all about possessive pronouns.

16:15.391 --> 16:18.143
They be the latest thing,
does not thee know?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.188
Where I come from,
we don't possess our pronouns.

16:21.271 --> 16:24.483
We let them run free,
like the majestic snow chimp.

16:24.566 --> 16:26.527
[both chuckle]

16:26.610 --> 16:28.112
Can I show you around?

16:28.195 --> 16:30.739
[chuckles mockingly] Ugh!

16:30.823 --> 16:34.326
Odval and Sorcerio will put
an end to all this naughtiness.

16:40.416 --> 16:41.917
-Oh, my!
-Wow.

16:42.001 --> 16:45.504
Elfo, you mustn't be here.
This is an ancient secret society

16:45.587 --> 16:48.257
that conducts great matters of state
and diplomacy.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.551
We are the shadow behind the crown,

16:50.634 --> 16:54.346
the prime movers of history,
the unseen hand.

16:54.430 --> 16:55.472
-[yelps]
-[man giggles]

16:55.556 --> 16:58.142
It looks like people are just having sex.

16:58.225 --> 17:02.021
Oh, yes, we do that, too.
Diplomacy is complicated.

17:02.104 --> 17:04.690
I don't want to interrupt
whatever those four people are doing,

17:04.773 --> 17:06.734
but could you come throw a wet blanket...

17:06.817 --> 17:09.111
not that wet blanket,
on the party upstairs?

17:09.194 --> 17:11.989
I'm sorry. I'm sort of
in the middle of someone right now.

17:12.072 --> 17:14.283
Come back later with an open mind.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.119
And your sassy friend, the talking cat.

17:18.245 --> 17:19.288
[grunts]

17:24.501 --> 17:27.921
Wait. You're not a princess,
but you have a room in this castle?

17:28.005 --> 17:32.968
What? No. This isn't my room.
This is, uh, her room.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.096
Meet Princess Tiabunty.

17:37.097 --> 17:39.808
Oh, uh, I'm a princess, I is.

17:39.892 --> 17:43.562
Um, this is me bed
that me family lives on and...

17:43.645 --> 17:46.315
[whispering] Oh, so soft.

17:46.398 --> 17:48.400
[groaning and snoring]

17:52.821 --> 17:54.114
[both moaning]

17:58.911 --> 18:03.165
Ugh, great, everyone up here
is doing diplomacy, too.

18:09.630 --> 18:11.799
Ugh, you're still up?

18:11.882 --> 18:14.968
Uh, where's Bean? I thought you were
supposed to be chaperoning her.

18:15.052 --> 18:17.221
What? What's wrong with you?
Why would you think that?

18:17.304 --> 18:19.306
What? She's unchaperoned?

18:19.932 --> 18:23.519
Oh, hi, Bean. I'm not interrupting, am I?

18:24.770 --> 18:26.188
Mind if I sit on the bed?

18:26.271 --> 18:27.564
What are you doing?

18:27.648 --> 18:29.566
You allow your chimp on the bed?

18:29.650 --> 18:31.860
Elf, actually. Common mistake.

18:31.944 --> 18:33.362
Can you pass me a pillow?

18:33.445 --> 18:36.031
My back hurts
when my body's filled with rage.

18:36.115 --> 18:40.285
Oh, it's not healthy to store that.
Would you like to lie down?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.246
Elfo, get out of my room.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.415
This is your room? You are the princess?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.251
Elfo, I'm gonna kill you.

18:47.334 --> 18:48.961
Um, you can't kill me.

18:49.044 --> 18:52.506
Her dad needs me for the Elixir of Life.
It's kind of like insurance.

18:52.589 --> 18:54.133
The Elixir of Life?

18:54.216 --> 18:57.427
Your snowy hair and stormy breath
remind me of my homeland.

18:57.511 --> 19:00.889
You've been a comfort,
but my priorities have changed.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.516
Sven, wait.

19:02.599 --> 19:04.726
What is your problem, man?

19:04.810 --> 19:09.898
This weekend was my one chance at freedom
and you ruined it, just like my dad.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.317
You are just a little, green Zog.

19:12.401 --> 19:15.779
No, wait!
I was just trying to control you.

19:15.863 --> 19:16.989
Oh.

19:17.072 --> 19:20.159
Well, it's not like
your dad is entirely... Oh.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.202
Well, at least he... Oh.

19:22.703 --> 19:24.580
Uh... Oh. I'm sorry. I was too aggressive.

19:30.169 --> 19:33.630
I'll go back to being passive aggressive,
'cause it worked so well.

19:33.714 --> 19:36.717
Too late.
Tonight's turned into a carriage wreck.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.970
I just want to send people home
and curl up with my favorite book.

19:40.053 --> 19:42.097
The hollowed-out one
with the booze inside?

19:42.181 --> 19:43.432
Yeah. I can't put it down.

19:44.016 --> 19:48.103
Party's over. Everyone out.
Come on, guys. Look alive.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.731
-[Elfo] I don't think they can anymore.
-[Sven] Ah?

19:51.773 --> 19:53.442
Seize them.

19:55.444 --> 19:57.029
[Bean and Elfo grunt]

19:58.197 --> 19:59.031
[Luci grunts]

20:00.866 --> 20:02.868
[all grunting]

20:16.715 --> 20:17.966
[all grunt]

20:20.636 --> 20:24.806
I claim this castle
in the name of Land Vikings!

20:24.890 --> 20:28.310
-I am land king now!
-[Vikings cheering]

20:29.937 --> 20:32.898
This is why you gotta make people RSVP.

20:32.981 --> 20:34.983
[steam hissing]

20:35.067 --> 20:39.821
I wouldn't say I was locked up in
a lunatic asylum because I was crazy.

20:40.405 --> 20:44.409
Something in my voice
makes people real mad. [sighs]

20:44.493 --> 20:47.871
But, hey, I escaped and ended up here,

20:47.955 --> 20:51.124
and who knows what
I'm gonna do to you now. [chuckles]

20:52.125 --> 20:53.585
Yeah. [chuckles]

20:53.669 --> 20:55.671
[straining]

20:56.630 --> 20:58.507
[yelling indistinctly]

20:59.633 --> 21:02.886
-What the hell?
-[Chazz] You're cured.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.431
Congratulations, Your Highness.

21:06.515 --> 21:09.184
Not thinking about
your tummy troubles now, are you?

21:09.268 --> 21:12.646
You tortured me for 24 straight hours.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.022
That's what cures it.

21:14.106 --> 21:17.150
Well, that or the passage of time.
We're not really sure.

21:17.234 --> 21:19.611
I've had it with you
and your successful methods.

21:19.695 --> 21:22.030
I'm gettin' out
while I still have my dignity.

21:27.160 --> 21:30.580
I don't get why you'd want to take over
this shoddy kingdom anyway.

21:30.664 --> 21:35.585
We're broke. This castle's not even made
of real stone. It's particle stone.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.672
Vikings don't care about riches.

21:38.755 --> 21:43.051
We want immortality, that our names
might live on for a hundred years.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.012
We must have the Elixir of Life.

21:45.095 --> 21:49.266
Hear ye, hear ye!
The return of King Zog is imminent.

21:49.349 --> 21:52.936
Please do not shoot
the messenger any more.

21:54.771 --> 21:59.234
Oh, God, my dad's gonna kill us, and then
the Vikings are gonna kill my dad.

21:59.318 --> 22:01.820
Hey, at least Elfo's sad.
Look at his lip quiver.

22:01.903 --> 22:06.199
[sighs] There's only one thing left to do.
I'm switching teams.

22:06.283 --> 22:08.118
Called it. Knew it by the pants.

22:08.201 --> 22:11.204
I'm joining forces
with our savage conqueror.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.122
What?

22:14.499 --> 22:15.834
Your Majesty.

22:15.917 --> 22:18.128
Ah, now we're talking.

22:18.211 --> 22:21.757
We shall rule together
as tyrant and tyrantina.

22:22.382 --> 22:23.967
[whimpers]

22:24.051 --> 22:27.554
If this is what you want, Bean,
I won't stand in your way.

22:27.637 --> 22:30.307
I wish you all the gumdrops
in the rainbow.

22:30.390 --> 22:34.853
Thanks, Elfo. And when those gumdrops
get stuck in our throats,

22:34.936 --> 22:36.772
as they inevitably will,

22:36.855 --> 22:42.152
we shall wash them down with
the Elixir of Life, which we totally have.

22:48.658 --> 22:50.494
[gasps] Oh.

22:50.577 --> 22:52.913
This shoddy kingdom is ours forever.

22:52.996 --> 22:57.459
Eternity shall remember
the names of Sven and, uh...

22:57.542 --> 22:59.586
-Bean.
-Really?

22:59.669 --> 23:03.048
Behold, guys, the Elixir of Life.

23:12.516 --> 23:15.936
[Sven] Why are there so many dead things
floating in the Elixir of Life?

23:16.019 --> 23:19.189
-A little bug never hurt anyone.
-What about that squirrel?

23:19.689 --> 23:21.775
Oh, that's my pet Bloaty.

23:21.858 --> 23:27.906
Wait a minute. You named your pet squirrel
Bloaty before he died and got all bloated?

23:27.989 --> 23:29.825
And your name is Sven and you're a Viking,

23:29.908 --> 23:32.119
so we're all a little obvious here,
aren't we?

23:32.202 --> 23:33.453
Come on, drink up.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.497
[Vikings muttering indistinctly]

23:35.580 --> 23:39.292
Hold on. I didn't become regional manager
of the Land Vikings

23:39.376 --> 23:41.211
by drinking any old liquid.

23:41.294 --> 23:43.088
How do I know this is not a trick?

23:43.171 --> 23:45.006
'Cause I told you?

23:46.007 --> 23:48.009
Showed you. I have to show you.

23:56.101 --> 23:59.479
Well, here's to seeing
the sun rise another day.

24:01.523 --> 24:03.942
Oh, oh. [gagging]

24:04.025 --> 24:06.111
See? It's totally fine.

24:06.194 --> 24:08.947
Are you turning green?
Or were you already green?

24:09.030 --> 24:13.118
[grunts] When I'm immortal, I'll have
plenty of time to consider things.

24:13.201 --> 24:14.202
[exhales]

24:18.498 --> 24:21.251
Huh. I wasn't expecting to chew.

24:22.085 --> 24:23.295
[stomachs rumbling]

24:23.378 --> 24:25.672
Right this way, gentlemen.

24:26.631 --> 24:28.550
Luci, pull the lever.

24:28.633 --> 24:30.635
[Vikings yelling]

24:34.806 --> 24:40.020
Bean! Bean! Grab my hand!
As your future husband, I command it.

24:40.103 --> 24:43.023
Oh, you shouldn't have said that.
Here's a hammer.

24:43.106 --> 24:44.608
[Sven] Please, don't hammer my fingers.

24:44.691 --> 24:48.069
Look at you.
You're just a coward like every other guy

24:48.153 --> 24:50.947
except that one over there,
with his head in a bucket.

24:52.866 --> 24:56.620
[yelling] This is why you're still single!

24:58.121 --> 25:02.042
Wow! I can't believe you just sent
so many people to their death.

25:02.125 --> 25:05.086
Death?
No, they'll just all fall into the ocean.

25:05.170 --> 25:06.588
[Vikings thud]

25:06.671 --> 25:09.257
Oh. I guess it was low tide.

25:09.341 --> 25:14.888
Hey, Elfo, I just want to say that
what you did really means a lot to me.

25:14.971 --> 25:16.515
I won't forget it.

25:17.224 --> 25:18.350
Can you hear me?

25:19.726 --> 25:20.977
Hey, can you hear me?

25:21.061 --> 25:24.481
Can you maybe save this for later,
when I can appreciate it?

25:24.564 --> 25:28.276
"And they looked into each other's eyes,
and the question arose.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.488
Will they or won't they...

25:31.571 --> 25:34.991
notice that King Zog's carriage
has arrived in the courtyard right now?"

25:41.706 --> 25:43.917
Oh, God, I've never cleaned before.

25:44.000 --> 25:46.378
You don't have to tell me
what happened up here

25:46.461 --> 25:48.505
if I don't have to tell you
what happened down there.

25:48.588 --> 25:50.423
Deal. Just help me clean.

25:50.507 --> 25:54.427
Elfo, you scrub the blood off the walls,
and I'll sweep up the crushed pretzels.

25:58.265 --> 26:00.392
[Luci] Hey, uh,
what do I do with this leg?

26:00.475 --> 26:02.894
Stuff it up the chimney with these torsos.

26:03.562 --> 26:08.692
[groans] Castle looks pretty good.
Main entrance nice and clean.

26:08.775 --> 26:11.987
Portcullis properly lowered
to defensive position.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.990
Walking up stairs now.
Landing neat and tidy.

26:15.073 --> 26:18.326
Second set of stairs, also fine.

26:18.410 --> 26:22.664
Now approaching the throne room,
not expecting any surprises.

26:22.747 --> 26:26.418
Blood pressure steady as I enter and...

26:27.544 --> 26:31.673
Oh. It's totally clean
and there are people here to greet me.

26:31.756 --> 26:33.174
How nice.

26:33.258 --> 26:37.137
Welcome back to your castle, Father,
where nothing unusual occurred.

26:37.220 --> 26:40.390
Certainly no religious sex magic rituals.

26:40.473 --> 26:41.683
Glad to hear it.

26:41.766 --> 26:46.146
Now I would like to sit on my throne
and rule my kingdom,

26:46.229 --> 26:49.941
which most certainly was not overthrown
by barbarians.

26:50.025 --> 26:51.776
Dad, why are you talking like that?

26:51.860 --> 26:53.945
Sorry, I had a stroke on the way home.

26:54.029 --> 26:56.781
[crowing]

27:02.203 --> 27:06.833
Hey, at least you get to watch the sunrise
with a girl. Sorry it's just me.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.753
Well, maybe someday
you'll get your wish, too.

27:10.462 --> 27:11.755
I have wishes, too.

27:11.838 --> 27:14.966
But you wouldn't know that
because you never asked. Rude.

27:15.050 --> 27:17.302
I also had a dream
where all my teeth fell out.

27:17.385 --> 27:19.304
That's weird, right? [chuckles]

27:19.387 --> 27:20.388
Man, dreams.

27:20.472 --> 27:23.808
Maybe reality is the dream
and dreams are reality.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.185
You ever think about that?

27:25.685 --> 27:28.647
[chuckles] I'm pretty high.

27:31.191 --> 27:32.442
[groans]

27:32.525 --> 27:35.820
You know,
I think a fire would be nice, yeah.

27:35.904 --> 27:40.325
Okay. Picking up the poker.
Opening the flue, and...

27:42.452 --> 27:47.415
Bean!
