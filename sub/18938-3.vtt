Alicia: Okay, take one,
pass it on.

00:07.838 --> 00:09.422
(Baby coos)

00:11.255 --> 00:13.755
Kate: Say hi Auntie Kate. Hi.

00:15.797 --> 00:17.630
What's this?

00:18.922 --> 00:20.880
- (Reads) Hear ye, hear ye?

00:20.880 --> 00:22.505
This is a little excessive.

00:22.505 --> 00:24.422
- Well, they only turn one,
once.

00:24.422 --> 00:26.255
And we are doing a whole
princess theme.

00:26.255 --> 00:27.797
It's gender neutral of course.

00:27.797 --> 00:29.005
- You have a registry?

00:29.005 --> 00:30.463
- Well, you guys know
how it is.

00:30.463 --> 00:32.880
I mean, we keep on getting
the same gifts.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.338
I mean, how many
"Goodnight Moons"

00:34.338 --> 00:36.005
can one child own?

00:36.005 --> 00:37.380
Well, this way I can let
you know

00:37.380 --> 00:39.463
exactly what Baby Mabel needs.

00:39.463 --> 00:41.588
- She's going to need years
of therapy.

00:41.588 --> 00:44.005
- Well, I think it's really
cute, Alicia.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.505
- Thank you, Jenny.

00:47.505 --> 00:49.422
You know, I was sort
of hoping this party

00:49.422 --> 00:51.880
could help bridge the gap
between all of us.

00:51.880 --> 00:53.088
- Beautiful.

00:53.088 --> 00:54.255
- I was actually a princess

00:54.255 --> 00:55.588
for Halloween a couple
years ago.

00:55.588 --> 00:56.672
- Of course you were.

00:56.672 --> 00:58.005
- Just because I like
to fem it up,

00:58.005 --> 00:59.047
doesn't mean that
I'm not strong.

00:59.047 --> 01:00.713
- I don't know,
in my line of work,

01:00.713 --> 01:01.880
if you dress up girly,

01:01.880 --> 01:03.338
you are asking to be treated
differently.

01:03.338 --> 01:04.963
- So, what's wrong with that?

01:04.963 --> 01:06.297
I like to be treated
differently.

01:06.297 --> 01:07.672
- No you don't,
it drives you crazy.

01:07.672 --> 01:09.630
- Kate, I feel like you're
projecting.

01:09.630 --> 01:10.797
- I'm not.

01:10.797 --> 01:12.338
Anne, back me up.
I'm not projecting.

01:12.338 --> 01:14.463
- Hm, you might be projecting.

01:14.463 --> 01:16.672
But she's being super annoying.
No question.

01:16.672 --> 01:18.963
- Seriously? How has playing
the card ever helped?

01:18.963 --> 01:20.297
- What card?

01:20.297 --> 01:21.963
- You know the card,
we've all played the card.

01:21.963 --> 01:23.130
Val's played the card.

01:23.130 --> 01:25.130
- Yeah, you know.
The helpless girl card.

01:25.130 --> 01:27.463
- You ever played dumb to get
a guy to do some work for you?

01:27.463 --> 01:29.880
- Or pretend that you don't
know how to do your taxes?

01:29.880 --> 01:33.130
- Or, like fake an orgasm
because you medically can't?

01:33.130 --> 01:35.922
And you're sick of...
of explaining it.

01:35.922 --> 01:39.797
So... you know,
not everyone can cum.

01:41.755 --> 01:43.130
(Baby coos)

01:44.630 --> 01:46.797
Okay, so...

01:46.797 --> 01:50.463
we have covered a lot of really
important topics here, today.

01:50.463 --> 01:51.963
I think I'm gonna go ahead
and call it.

01:51.963 --> 01:54.172

Kate: Okay. So mom, this list
covers all contacts

02:05.505 --> 02:08.213
you'll need in an emergency
situation with Charlie.

02:08.213 --> 02:09.713
Really? Look.

02:09.713 --> 02:12.005
There is his pediatrician,
his dentist.

02:12.005 --> 02:13.922
Uh, Emergency room,
which is a good one, right?

02:13.922 --> 02:15.505
And uh, fire department.

02:15.505 --> 02:17.505
- What circumstance
would constitute

02:17.505 --> 02:18.547
calling the fire department?

02:18.547 --> 02:19.922
- Well, obviously
if he's on fire.

02:19.922 --> 02:21.713
- Of course.
Kate, you act like

02:21.713 --> 02:23.422
I never raised you
and your sister.

02:23.422 --> 02:25.547
You turned out fairly decently.

02:25.547 --> 02:26.547
- Mm-hmm.

02:26.547 --> 02:28.422
So this bad boy covers
anything

02:28.422 --> 02:30.172
from your standard
candle falling over,

02:30.172 --> 02:31.797
to a full-on grease fire.

02:31.797 --> 02:33.172
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:33.172 --> 02:34.922
- Thanks for watching Charlie.

02:34.922 --> 02:36.630
- It's what I live for.

02:36.630 --> 02:38.005
Besides, I didn't like
that Rebecca.

02:38.005 --> 02:39.297
Her face was off.

02:41.213 --> 02:43.130
- Anyway Mom,
here is Charlie's schedule.

02:43.130 --> 02:44.505
I also have it printed
on his bedroom door,

02:44.505 --> 02:46.380
just so you--
- Yeah, and if you miss those,

02:46.380 --> 02:47.880
there's about 20 more
around the house.

02:47.880 --> 02:50.505
- Okay enough, both of you go.
I've got this.

02:50.505 --> 02:51.588
- Thank you, Eleanor.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.130
And you're okay watching Olly,
right?

02:53.130 --> 02:54.172
- Who's Olly?

02:54.172 --> 02:56.047
- My dog, mom, of 16 years?

02:56.047 --> 02:58.130
- Oh, of course. Him.

03:00.088 --> 03:01.463
He won't bite the baby, will he?

03:01.463 --> 03:02.963
- Of course not,
they're brothers.

03:02.963 --> 03:04.880
- I just don't think dogs
should be around children.

03:04.880 --> 03:06.547
- Okay, we should go.

03:07.630 --> 03:10.588
Thank you again, Eleanor,

How's it goin'?

downloaded a virus.

It won't happen again.

- So, sorry,
what won't happen again?

04:28.588 --> 04:30.547
Did you, or did you not
download a virus?

04:30.547 --> 04:32.755
- No, I didn't.
It was a bad joke.

04:35.130 --> 04:37.297
- Um, why would you joke
about that?

04:37.297 --> 04:38.797
This is a tech company, Jenny.

04:38.797 --> 04:41.547
- I-I know.
I was just messing around.

04:41.547 --> 04:42.880

What the fuck.

04:42.880 --> 04:44.380

04:45.422 --> 04:46.630
But sorry,
just to be really clear,

04:46.630 --> 04:48.380
there's no virus that I need
to worry about?

04:48.380 --> 04:50.130
- No. No virus.

04:51.713 --> 04:55.755
Nothing here but a...
a silly jokester.

- Okay.

05:08.130 --> 05:09.797
- What the hell was that?

05:09.797 --> 05:11.547
- I don't know.

05:11.547 --> 05:13.255
Have I been out of the game
that long?

05:13.255 --> 05:14.463
I thought I was being cute.

05:14.463 --> 05:16.047
- That read like a drunk
stewardess.

05:16.047 --> 05:17.630
- That was mortifying.

05:17.630 --> 05:18.797
- Not that you're even
available,

05:18.797 --> 05:20.380
but why don't you just try
being yourself?

05:22.380 --> 05:24.172
- What if I don't know
what that is?

05:24.172 --> 05:26.130
- Well, maybe it's time you
figure that out.

05:26.130 --> 05:28.547
Or I don't know, you could
just focus on your marriage,

05:28.547 --> 05:30.255

to see my penis.

06:13.922 --> 06:15.588
- Well, it's obviously his
dick. It's a fine dick.

06:15.588 --> 06:18.172
Mo: It's an amazing dick.

06:18.172 --> 06:19.255
But what I'm saying is that

06:19.255 --> 06:21.130
this doesn't necessarily
read as yours.

06:21.130 --> 06:22.880
I mean, this woman
has no proof.

06:22.880 --> 06:24.797
- I literally just said that.
No proof that it's your dick.

06:24.797 --> 06:25.880
- Kate, if you don't mind,

06:25.880 --> 06:27.838
I'd like to know what Mo
has to say.

06:27.838 --> 06:29.338
So what you're saying is,

06:29.338 --> 06:31.130
if I tell people it's not me,
people will buy that, Mo?

06:31.130 --> 06:32.588
Mo and Kate: Yes.

06:32.588 --> 06:33.963
- Now, are there any other
images of you two out there,

06:33.963 --> 06:35.880
that could prove you're
romantically linked?

06:35.880 --> 06:37.672
- No. I was very discreet.

06:37.672 --> 06:39.255
- Are you sure?
Because you never know,

06:39.255 --> 06:40.922
someone may have snapped a pic
of you guys together somewhere.

06:40.922 --> 06:43.005
- Jesus, lady,
I just said I was discreet.

06:43.005 --> 06:44.838
What have you got,
tampons in your ears?

06:44.838 --> 06:46.380
- Excuse me?

06:46.380 --> 06:48.255
- Relax. It's a joke.

06:49.463 --> 06:50.963
- You're going to be fine,
James.

06:50.963 --> 06:53.130
We'll put together a statement
for you to review.

06:53.130 --> 06:54.838
- Good, thank you, Mo.

06:54.838 --> 06:57.088
- Of course.
- May I speak?

06:58.088 --> 07:00.297
- Now I want you to lay low
until we make a statement.

07:00.297 --> 07:01.463
Do you understand?

07:01.463 --> 07:03.505
- Yes. I'm not a child.

07:04.130 --> 07:06.213
- Could have fooled me,
with the size of that dick.

07:06.213 --> 07:08.547
- We'll take care of it, James.
You just do your thing.

07:08.547 --> 07:11.463
Ah, he's gone.

07:11.463 --> 07:12.922
Good job.

07:12.922 --> 07:14.797
- (Kate sighs)

07:14.797 --> 07:17.255
I guarantee you, there are pics
of that guy and that girl,

07:17.255 --> 07:18.838
making out in some club,
somewhere.

07:18.838 --> 07:21.005
- Okay, he isn't the easiest
client, but he is the client.

07:21.005 --> 07:22.672
And biting your tongue
every once in a while,

07:22.672 --> 07:24.505
empowers them to reveal more.

07:24.505 --> 07:26.797
And... also part of this job
is being likeable.

07:26.797 --> 07:28.422
- I'm sorry, I am likeable.

07:28.422 --> 07:29.547
I'm super fuckin' likeable.

07:29.547 --> 07:32.380
- Yeah, you are. So bring it.

07:53.297 --> 07:56.297
You were just... uh, festive.

07:56.297 --> 07:57.380
- Are you kidding me?

07:57.380 --> 07:59.005
My nine-year old
is highly provocative,

07:59.005 --> 08:00.922
and my baby is already showing
clear signs

08:00.922 --> 08:02.797
of sexual aggression.

08:02.797 --> 08:04.755
At bath time,
she pushes her privates

08:04.755 --> 08:06.547
towards the running faucet.

08:06.547 --> 08:08.172
- Stop it.
- Mm-hm.

08:08.172 --> 08:09.505

common: strict parents.

You're not worried about him
being penetrated.

17:24.172 --> 17:25.672
But he doesn't.

17:25.672 --> 17:27.630
He practices self-restraint,
right,

17:27.630 --> 17:30.463
because they're friends.

17:30.463 --> 17:33.088
- See? There it is.

17:33.088 --> 17:34.963
- (Chuckling)

17:34.963 --> 17:36.630
- That's working for me.
- It is?

17:38.422 --> 17:40.338
(Children's playful laughter)

17:40.338 --> 17:46.005

good cheer ♪

17:46.005 --> 17:49.588

18:02.505 --> 18:04.422
Kate: Evil queen. Nice.

18:05.547 --> 18:06.672
Where's Alice?

18:06.672 --> 18:08.130
Anne: Over there.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.797
(Kate sighs)

18:09.797 --> 18:12.713
- What is she supposed to be
with the jacket?

18:12.713 --> 18:14.297
- On probation.
- Ah.

18:14.297 --> 18:16.505
- She got her hands on one of
those sexy Halloween costumes.

18:16.505 --> 18:19.255
Took us ten outfit changes,
but here we are.

18:19.255 --> 18:21.630
- Hmm, man, she is going
to kill you.

18:21.630 --> 18:23.797
- If I don't kill her first.

18:23.797 --> 18:25.547
Ooh, tiara.

18:25.547 --> 18:27.630
- Yeah, I'm trying something
out.

18:27.630 --> 18:30.130
- I like it.
- Thanks.

18:30.130 --> 18:31.672
- Hey!

18:31.672 --> 18:32.922
- What the hell is this?

18:32.922 --> 18:35.422
- What? I felt like wearing
a suit.

18:35.422 --> 18:37.047
- You look like you're running
for mayor.

18:37.047 --> 18:38.297
- In a porn.

18:38.297 --> 18:39.588
- Will you shut up?

18:39.588 --> 18:41.297
I've got a lot more to me
than you guys think.

18:41.297 --> 18:42.505
Anne: Well, that's...

18:42.505 --> 18:44.005
you know what, good for you.
That's great.

18:44.005 --> 18:46.047
I'm trying to instill
some of that discipline

18:46.047 --> 18:49.255
in my daughter right now.
Right, Alice?

18:49.255 --> 18:51.672
And just like that somebody
is not getting birthday cake.

18:51.672 --> 18:53.172
- Come on!

18:54.255 --> 18:55.713
- Ugh! So help me,

18:55.713 --> 18:58.172
I'm going to build the next
Maria Shriver out of her.

18:58.172 --> 18:59.172
- I believe in you.

18:59.172 --> 19:02.047
- The royal cake is served.

19:04.130 --> 19:06.797
- Just 'cause we're dressed up
as princesses,

19:06.797 --> 19:09.672
doesn't mean the darkness
isn't closing in.

19:09.672 --> 19:12.047
(Shrill scream)

19:12.047 --> 19:13.380
Whoa, okay, okay.

19:13.380 --> 19:15.672
- Mommy! Your friend's gonna
fall!

19:15.672 --> 19:16.755
Kate: Jesus!
Anne: Oh shit!

19:16.755 --> 19:19.213
Jenny: Oh my goodness.
Anne: Oh my God!

19:20.255 --> 19:21.755
- Oh hey, Kate! Woo!
- Hey Frankie,

19:21.755 --> 19:23.630
I want you to hold on real
tight to that thing, okay?

19:23.630 --> 19:25.338
- You know what, this bra's
driving me fuckin' crazy.

19:25.338 --> 19:26.755
- Hey, Frankie--

19:26.755 --> 19:28.130
- You know, you don't need
to worry about me anymore.

19:28.130 --> 19:29.547
Okay? I'm good.

19:29.547 --> 19:32.338
Anne prescribed me some
candies. Hey, Annie!

19:32.338 --> 19:33.922
- Okay, Frankie, I don't want
you to move, okay?

19:33.922 --> 19:36.380
- Okay! Sound like my mother.

19:36.380 --> 19:38.838
You're not the boss of me,
okay? I'm in charge!

19:38.838 --> 19:39.755
(Frankie screams)

19:39.755 --> 19:41.588
Giselle: What the hell?
Frankie?

19:41.588 --> 19:43.088
What, what happened?
Jenny: Listen to me,

19:43.088 --> 19:44.797
listen to me, you have to keep
it together okay?

19:44.797 --> 19:46.630
Kate: Okay Frankie,
listen to me, okay?

19:46.630 --> 19:48.838
I know you're scared,
all right. I'm scared.

19:48.838 --> 19:50.422
I don't know what I'm doing
half the damn time.

19:50.422 --> 19:52.005
- What? You've always got your
shit together, man.

19:52.005 --> 19:53.505
You're like a cop.

19:53.505 --> 19:56.213
- I know it looks like that.
It doesn't feel like that.

19:56.213 --> 19:58.422
I don't know, it feels like
I'm faking it.

19:58.422 --> 19:59.755
- I get that.

19:59.755 --> 20:01.838
Giselle: Frankie,
what are you doing, baby?

20:01.838 --> 20:03.422
- I just, please don't cry,
okay?

20:03.422 --> 20:05.547
(Frankie falling
and women screaming)

20:05.547 --> 20:07.588
Kate: Hey, hey, Frankie!

20:07.588 --> 20:09.463
(Landing thud) Ooh.

20:09.463 --> 20:11.047
- Oh God.
- Oh.

20:12.338 --> 20:17.047
♪♪♪

20:18.797 --> 20:22.588
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

20:27.422 --> 20:31.047
♪ Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh ♪

20:32.422 --> 20:36.172
- So... things got pretty real,
pretty quick!

20:37.547 --> 20:40.547
Sorry about the whole
tree thing.

20:40.547 --> 20:42.088
Pretty sensitive to meds.

20:42.088 --> 20:43.422
- Yeah, you could have
mentioned that.

20:43.422 --> 20:45.797
- I put it all together.
I hope that's okay.

20:47.005 --> 20:48.297
- I got this.

20:49.505 --> 20:51.755
I'm not payin'.

20:51.755 --> 20:54.005
Not a goddamn dime.

20:54.005 --> 20:56.297
- No, wait. Seriously?

20:58.505 --> 21:01.130
Fem card. Nailed it.

21:01.130 --> 21:02.922
- Nope!
- No!

21:02.922 --> 21:03.922
- Not the fem card.

21:03.922 --> 21:06.588
Hi, yes, I got it.

21:07.588 --> 21:09.088
Sorry about that.
