10:56.209 --> 10:58.076
We can eat at my house. Cassie's got

10:58.161 --> 11:00.411
- enough guests to cook for.
- Oh, don't be silly.

11:00.977 --> 11:03.331
Cassie, do you have any of that
fresh-squeezed juice I like?

11:03.770 --> 11:05.306
I'm sorry, Cassie.

11:06.001 --> 11:08.135
- She doesn't mind.
- I don't.

11:08.170 --> 11:09.091
I do!

11:11.256 --> 11:12.796
Sam, you're a gentleman.

11:12.821 --> 11:14.699
You're all welcome to breakfast anytime.

11:14.727 --> 11:16.677
You are so sweet, thank you.

11:16.729 --> 11:19.062
Oh, just a little heads-up:
your French toast is just

11:19.148 --> 11:22.516
- a bit on the dry side today.
- Always open to feedback.

11:26.405 --> 11:29.106
So, are you ready
for your basketball tryout?

11:29.191 --> 11:31.692
It's not a tryout; it's a game.

11:31.744 --> 11:33.694
Yeah, well, I'm looking
forward to seeing you play.

11:33.696 --> 11:35.912
So am I. Hey, you know,
we could ride over together.

11:35.998 --> 11:38.031
That'd be good, but we won't.

11:38.117 --> 11:40.534
Oh, come on, I can swing by
and pick you up from work.

11:40.586 --> 11:42.953
No need to swing, Linda.

11:43.038 --> 11:44.862
But thanks.

11:46.048 --> 11:48.616
Hey, Cassie, do you want to come?

11:50.112 --> 11:52.446
- Yeah, come!
- Oh, you know,

11:52.514 --> 11:55.048
Cassie is so busy,
I'm sure she can't make it.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.851
You know, I don't have anyone
to cover for me at the store.

11:57.886 --> 12:01.103
Oh no. Darn! Hmm!

12:01.774 --> 12:04.057
You are really a great cook, Cassie.

12:04.448 --> 12:05.696
Thanks for this.

12:06.145 --> 12:07.978
Sure. You know, I could share
my recipes with you.

12:08.343 --> 12:10.114
Oh no, thank you.

12:10.149 --> 12:13.679
- If you change your mind...
- I won't. Haha!

12:15.704 --> 12:19.144
Cassie said you should be my... partner?

12:20.125 --> 12:21.908
Look, I am happy

12:21.960 --> 12:25.212
to have you work here as an employee...

12:25.247 --> 12:27.214
I mean, you just started working for me,

12:27.249 --> 12:30.584
and your restaurant experience
is, well, limited.

12:31.224 --> 12:34.255
I mean, I can certainly
give you more to do, but I think

12:34.306 --> 12:37.093
it's a little early to be
talking about taking you on

12:37.284 --> 12:37.993
as a partner.

12:39.133 --> 12:40.883
I really need you here at the Bistro.

12:41.706 --> 12:43.086
Look, I found an investor

12:43.171 --> 12:46.396
who is considering helping me
with my plans to expand.

12:47.490 --> 12:48.790
I want to add a catering

12:48.830 --> 12:51.247
storefront in that newly vacated
space down the street.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.300
That's a very big deal!

12:53.386 --> 12:55.502
It is, which is why I need an investor.

12:55.588 --> 12:57.504
For a small percentage of the business,

12:57.590 --> 12:59.657
I can get all
the working capital I need.

13:00.259 --> 13:03.928
But I need you to keep
things shipshape here

13:03.980 --> 13:06.096
while I get that business
up and running.

13:08.100 --> 13:10.818
It looks like we have our work
cut out for us, don't we?

13:10.903 --> 13:12.603
(Stephanie giggling)

13:12.655 --> 13:14.605
♪♪♪

13:18.494 --> 13:20.361
Do you mind
if we fill up our water bottles?

13:20.446 --> 13:22.529
- Oh, help yourself.
- We're heading out

13:22.615 --> 13:24.365
to Halter Falls for a hike.
Great suggestion.

13:24.450 --> 13:27.201
- Such a special place.
- You know, I just love hiking.

13:27.286 --> 13:29.929
- You know, communing with nature.
- Yeah, me too.

13:31.377 --> 13:35.078
- What about you, Larry?
- It's, uh, a good workout.

13:37.179 --> 13:40.631
Oh, um, before you head out,
the florist called about your flowers.

13:40.683 --> 13:42.850
- Oh, is there a problem?
- I am afraid so.

13:42.935 --> 13:45.970
Their cooler broke down last night,
and they lost most of their inventory.

13:46.055 --> 13:50.024
Can we call another florist?
I'll pay whatever it takes. Ha!

13:50.059 --> 13:52.150
You want your bride to be happy.

13:52.202 --> 13:53.834
- How lucky am I?
- Ha!

13:55.807 --> 13:57.147
I'll see what I can do.

13:57.199 --> 13:59.007
- Please.
- Sure.

13:59.652 --> 14:02.069
Oh, also before you head out,
one more thing.

14:02.154 --> 14:05.072
Cake: traditional layer with rosettes?

14:05.124 --> 14:07.374
- Bakery just called to confirm.
- Traditional all the way,

14:07.460 --> 14:09.564
- that's us.
- That's what we agreed to.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.212
I've seen a lot of engaged couples,

14:12.248 --> 14:14.214
and most have at least
a few disagreements

14:14.300 --> 14:16.333
over the wedding, but not you two.

14:16.385 --> 14:18.335
Hmm!

14:22.591 --> 14:24.558
Aaaaaah!

14:24.644 --> 14:26.560
I'm receiving a pretty prestigious award

14:26.646 --> 14:28.562
from the Middleton
Small Business Association

14:28.648 --> 14:30.731
at the end of the week, and an
acceptance speech is mandatory.

14:31.859 --> 14:32.598
(phone ringing)

14:32.685 --> 14:34.101
Aaah...

14:34.153 --> 14:36.103
I'm talking about croaking
like a bullfrog,

14:36.155 --> 14:38.072
and I've been practicing
for two weeks solid.

14:38.107 --> 14:40.190
I told you yesterday,
you have to rest your voice.

14:40.242 --> 14:43.193
- I did! Ahem!
- Except for all the practicing.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.861
- Well...
- It's definitely

14:44.914 --> 14:46.947
gotten worse.
You officially have laryngitis.

14:46.999 --> 14:50.367
- But how is that possible?
- Well, either you have

14:50.419 --> 14:53.120
an upper respiratory infection
or acid reflux

14:53.172 --> 14:54.396
or you've been talking too much.

14:54.874 --> 14:56.924
I'm going to bet on door number 3.

14:57.316 --> 14:59.542
Well, make it go away.

14:59.628 --> 15:01.879
I can't. But you can.

15:01.931 --> 15:04.465
You have to rest your voice. No talking.

15:04.550 --> 15:06.633
- (Martha gasping)
- I want to see you back tomorrow.

15:06.686 --> 15:08.719
But... but what about my speech?!

15:08.771 --> 15:09.979
I don't know what to tell you, Martha.

15:10.065 --> 15:12.556
Either you rest your voice or
you risk losing it completely.

15:12.608 --> 15:15.642
Well, thank you...

15:15.728 --> 15:17.019
but no thank you.

15:18.698 --> 15:20.698
This whole voice thing is nothing

15:20.733 --> 15:23.617
that a strong dose of herbal tea
won't take care of.

15:23.703 --> 15:26.860
Just because you don't like what I say
doesn't make it any less true.

15:27.456 --> 15:29.530
- (phone ringing)
- Hmm!

15:36.910 --> 15:38.748
<i>I saw your sign.</i>

15:38.834 --> 15:41.451
It kind of spoke of me.

15:42.138 --> 15:44.588
- So you're a waitress.
- I am.

15:44.590 --> 15:46.673
I just love being around
different people every day.

15:46.759 --> 15:48.592
And a vet tech?

15:48.677 --> 15:50.477
Oh, I love animals.

15:50.513 --> 15:53.680
- And you work in a bakery.
- Uh, part time.

15:53.733 --> 15:56.934
I-I just have loved baking
ever since I was a little girl.

15:57.707 --> 15:59.153
I read an article

15:59.188 --> 16:01.655
about a woman who started
her own organic pet food store.

16:01.690 --> 16:03.657
She makes everything from scratch.

16:04.211 --> 16:07.611
No. Why, I can't make
a living baking for animals.

16:10.916 --> 16:13.000
(Cassie): You know, pet food
is a billion-dollar industry.

16:13.085 --> 16:14.963
- Billion?
- And growing.

16:15.504 --> 16:17.788
- (redhead woman sighing)
- Time is precious.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.457
If you only have time to choose
one new venture in life,

16:20.509 --> 16:22.847
you can never go wrong
choosing something you love.

16:23.379 --> 16:24.778
Thanks.

16:25.631 --> 16:27.548
I almost didn't come in here.

16:27.633 --> 16:29.896
It was your sign in the window.

16:30.583 --> 16:33.053
Good luck, Megan. Hm!

16:37.309 --> 16:39.693
Did you tell Abigail
I should make her my partner?

16:39.779 --> 16:42.980
- No, she told me!
- I don't know what she's thinking.

16:42.982 --> 16:45.199
Well, she's definitely
thinking up something.

16:45.234 --> 16:48.402
Hmm... Well, I'm glad she took
it well when I told her no.

16:48.454 --> 16:50.370
- Abigail?!
- (both chuckling)

16:50.406 --> 16:52.739
I know. I was a little surprised too.

16:52.825 --> 16:55.707
Oh... I find with Abigail
that what she says

16:55.759 --> 16:57.911
and what she means are often
two very different things.

16:57.997 --> 17:01.498
But I am very clear and was very clear:

17:01.550 --> 17:03.333
no partnership, period.

17:03.385 --> 17:06.086
- Good.
- (Stephanie sighs.)

17:08.808 --> 17:12.009
- What's this?
- It's a natural oil

17:12.060 --> 17:13.348
that repels bugs.

17:14.523 --> 17:16.596
Did Ben tell you he's taking me camping?

17:16.682 --> 17:17.902
No, you did.

17:18.483 --> 17:19.900
Oh!

17:19.935 --> 17:21.935
Everything in that store is plaid.

17:22.021 --> 17:23.936
It was very visually upsetting.

17:24.022 --> 17:26.690
Oh, I think it's sweet. He wants
to share something he loves with you.

17:26.742 --> 17:29.193
Ugh, I only said yes 'cause
I didn't want to upset him.

17:29.245 --> 17:31.195
We just started dating.

17:31.247 --> 17:33.097
Just remember that being open

17:33.149 --> 17:35.449
to new things is what brought
Ben into your life.

17:35.501 --> 17:37.534
I will be open.

17:37.586 --> 17:39.030
But if I turn into

17:39.032 --> 17:42.256
a free-lunch buffet for a bunch
of hungry mosquitoes, it's over.

17:42.341 --> 17:44.275
- Sounds fair.
- Sounds itchy.

17:44.510 --> 17:45.486
(both laughing)

17:47.546 --> 17:50.297
- (woman): Thank you very much.
- (man): Yeah, thank you.

17:50.382 --> 17:53.550
He says he loves me and he is so cute,

17:53.636 --> 17:55.552
but you know what I did last night?

17:55.638 --> 17:58.055
Watched football again! Football!

17:58.107 --> 18:01.058
I mean, he may love me,
but he loves Tom Brady more.

18:01.060 --> 18:03.527
- Ahem!
- Hi, Dr. Radford.

18:03.562 --> 18:05.729
Hi. Can I have
a word with you privately?

18:05.731 --> 18:08.065
- Sure! Give me a sec.
- Yeah.

18:08.150 --> 18:09.584
What's up, Doc?

18:10.946 --> 18:13.287
Um... I think maybe some of the patients

18:13.372 --> 18:15.289
are a little... put off

18:15.374 --> 18:17.741
by your... familiarity.

18:19.578 --> 18:23.297
Can we just have a moratorium
on the gossip? I like a quiet office;

18:23.382 --> 18:24.906
I don't want the patients
to be uncomfortable.

18:25.801 --> 18:28.418
Josie, sweetie, am I
making you uncomfortable?

18:28.420 --> 18:30.587
Ha! Please!

18:30.639 --> 18:33.090
- She's fine.
- Yeah. I'm not.

18:33.142 --> 18:34.675
(softly): Oh.

18:34.760 --> 18:37.229
I guess you're making me uncomfortable.

18:38.647 --> 18:40.597
Doctors' offices are supposed
to be professional.

18:40.649 --> 18:42.566
It's what I'm used to.

18:42.601 --> 18:44.382
Consider me on mute.

18:44.687 --> 18:46.429
I'll stop talking.

18:47.072 --> 18:48.621
Now.

18:51.493 --> 18:53.827
(birds singing)

18:55.915 --> 18:57.915
Thank you for doing this, Mom.

18:58.501 --> 19:01.117
- Alright. I have to admit...
- What?

19:01.170 --> 19:04.454
Well, your dad,
this was kind of his department.

19:04.540 --> 19:06.790
Yeah.

19:06.842 --> 19:09.343
I remember him teaching me
how to ride a bike.

19:09.428 --> 19:11.011
And then he took off
the training wheels.

19:11.046 --> 19:13.297
- Ouch!
- (Cassie laughing)

19:13.382 --> 19:15.299
(both sighing)

19:15.351 --> 19:17.718
- OK, you're ready?
- I am. Are you?

19:17.803 --> 19:19.493
- Yes.
- OK.

19:23.859 --> 19:25.559
- Oh!
- What?

19:25.611 --> 19:27.978
- Slow down.
- I'm going the speed limit.

19:28.030 --> 19:30.514
- You're going a little fast.
- Hmm... nope.

19:31.846 --> 19:33.233
- See?
- (bike bell ringing)

19:33.319 --> 19:36.903
- That guy on the bike is passing us.
- Well, speaking of bikes,

19:36.956 --> 19:38.618
you're a little close, don't you think?

19:39.085 --> 19:41.232
No, I think I'm giving
him plenty of room.

19:41.257 --> 19:43.684
- Just give him a little more.

19:43.712 --> 19:46.473
- (sighing): Mom! Seriously!
- Don't look at me, look at the road.

19:46.558 --> 19:48.915
I'm sorry. If you could
just relax for a second.

19:50.669 --> 19:52.586
I've read the manual
forwards and backwards.

19:52.671 --> 19:54.360
Have you read the manual?
No, you have not.

19:54.446 --> 19:57.424
- Yes, I have.
- Yes, when you were, like, 15.

19:57.509 --> 19:58.886
- That was a long time ago.
- (Cassie sighing)

19:59.762 --> 20:02.057
I'm sorry, that was mean.

20:02.144 --> 20:04.457
Look, I am right and you are wrong.

20:04.703 --> 20:05.813
I was the correct distance

20:05.898 --> 20:08.065
behind the bike, and I would bet my life

20:08.150 --> 20:10.400
on it. Really, to be honest.
And if I had to say...

20:10.486 --> 20:12.486
- Oh! Oh, Grace!
- What?

20:16.741 --> 20:18.158
(sigh)

20:18.210 --> 20:19.943
Where are you going?

20:21.761 --> 20:23.881
I'm going to turn in
my learner's permit...

20:24.659 --> 20:25.999
and buy a bus pass.

20:31.976 --> 20:35.645
Well, this is no ordinary date.

20:35.697 --> 20:37.980
- Hmm?
- Exhibit A:

20:38.032 --> 20:40.983
you let me pick the movie,
sci-fi, when I know

20:41.069 --> 20:43.236
you wanted to see
that new romantic comedy.

20:43.321 --> 20:45.705
Exhibit B: you let me pick
the restaurant.

20:45.790 --> 20:48.569
You hate Greek. And exhibit C,

20:48.654 --> 20:49.992
to bring it all home,

20:50.061 --> 20:53.730
here we are at the Bistro
for chocolate cake.

20:53.798 --> 20:55.876
My favourite chocolate cake.

20:55.911 --> 20:58.745
Well... I love you.

21:00.249 --> 21:02.256
Well, I love you too.

21:03.159 --> 21:04.675
But seriously, what's up?

21:04.759 --> 21:06.592
(Tara sighs.)

21:07.294 --> 21:08.511
I'm late.

21:09.262 --> 21:11.347
Like late, late?

21:11.782 --> 21:13.516
I think I might be pregnant.

21:13.568 --> 21:15.601
(indistinct conversations)

Anyway, I am desperately in need

22:29.260 --> 22:31.500
of your help. My voice is going,

22:31.753 --> 22:35.037

22:53.398 --> 22:55.829
every elixir, every flower

I'm happy to help, Martha, but Sam
already gave you a diagnosis,

23:02.043 --> 23:04.627
and it's probably in your best
interest to take his advice.

23:04.712 --> 23:06.963
He's a QUACK! Ahem!

23:06.965 --> 23:10.550
- He is an accredited physician.
- He doesn't know everything.

23:10.635 --> 23:12.617
He graduated top of his class
in medical school.

room for a reach-in cooler

There's plenty of space

23:31.990 --> 23:33.906
for a prep station right here,

23:33.992 --> 23:36.709
and I plan to rent to own
gently-used equipment.

No. Don't accept the delivery

Yes.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.700
I do have some thoughts.

24:16.701 --> 24:19.619
- I'd love to hear them.
- Over wine or dinner?

How about we start with wine
and move on to dinner?

OK. I love you, but right now,
