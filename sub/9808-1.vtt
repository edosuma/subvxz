to far too much risk,

00:54.326 --> 00:55.693
and their earnings
look inflated.

00:55.794 --> 00:56.895
Just put the brakes
on it now.

00:59.232 --> 01:00.465
Morning, Ernie.

01:00.566 --> 01:01.968
Oh, good morning.

01:02.069 --> 01:03.669
See what our
cubbies done?

01:03.770 --> 01:05.871
Ooh, white flag time
at wrigley.

01:05.972 --> 01:07.839
Lester's finally
earning his keep.

01:07.941 --> 01:09.542
Let's hope
he can keep it up.

01:09.643 --> 01:10.810
There you go.

01:10.911 --> 01:12.278
Oh, thank you.

Morning, Debbie.

01:37.006 --> 01:38.073
Whoo!

01:38.174 --> 01:39.141
Busy weekend, I see.

01:39.242 --> 01:40.975
Oof, grueling.

01:41.076 --> 01:41.943
I mean, I don't know
how much longer

01:42.044 --> 01:43.611
I can juggle
all these guys.

01:43.712 --> 01:45.748
As long as it doesn't
interfere with your work.

01:45.849 --> 01:46.849
Oh, mm-mm.

01:46.950 --> 01:48.918
I've revised
the dunlop contract,

01:49.019 --> 01:49.920
typed 20 letters,

01:50.021 --> 01:50.887
and picked up your suits
from the cleaners.

01:50.988 --> 01:52.722
Love is...

01:52.823 --> 01:54.556
It's better
than a triple espresso

01:54.658 --> 01:55.557
with a red bull chaser.

01:55.659 --> 01:58.228
You're dating
three different men.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.629
What do you know
about love?

01:59.730 --> 02:01.731
A lot more than someone
who doesn't date any.

02:03.702 --> 02:04.702
These better
be perfect.

02:04.803 --> 02:06.202
Mm-hmm!

02:07.471 --> 02:08.372
Daddy!

02:08.473 --> 02:09.473
Kitten!

02:11.510 --> 02:12.376
If you're free tonight,

02:12.477 --> 02:14.079
Charles wants
to take you to dinner.

02:14.180 --> 02:15.380
The ferguson deal
is closing tomorrow.

02:15.481 --> 02:17.214
I will be eating
at my desk.

02:17.316 --> 02:19.183
Oh, surely, you can spare
an hour or two.

02:20.553 --> 02:22.754
I'm perfectly capable
of setting up my own dates.

02:22.855 --> 02:23.789
Dates? Yes.

02:23.890 --> 02:25.223
Your assistant, Debbie,

02:25.325 --> 02:26.225
has single-handedly proven

02:26.327 --> 02:27.794
that there are plenty
of dates to be had.

02:28.861 --> 02:29.861
But don't you think
it's time

02:29.963 --> 02:30.996
you got a bit
more serious?

02:31.097 --> 02:32.198
You've been seeing
Charles for a while now,

02:32.299 --> 02:34.734
and 35 is right
around the corner.

02:34.835 --> 02:35.768
Which means I'm far too old

02:35.836 --> 02:37.537
to have my father
playing matchmaker.

02:37.638 --> 02:39.673
I know finding the right man
hasn't been easy for you.

02:39.774 --> 02:40.808
Daddy, please...

02:40.908 --> 02:43.409
I know how easily
men can be intimidated

02:43.510 --> 02:44.912
by a woman's
professional success.

02:45.013 --> 02:47.114
If their fragile egos
can't handle it,

02:47.215 --> 02:48.082
that's their problem.

02:48.183 --> 02:49.316
Well, few men are equipped

02:49.417 --> 02:51.186
to deal
with a woman of your caliber,

02:51.287 --> 02:52.620
but Charles seems to be able
to handle it.

02:53.688 --> 02:54.955
What makes you so sure

02:55.056 --> 02:56.324
he doesn't have
an ulterior motive?

02:56.425 --> 02:57.892
That his real interest
doesn't lie

02:57.994 --> 02:59.394
in getting his hands
on this company,

02:59.495 --> 03:00.962
on everything
you and I have built?

03:01.063 --> 03:02.264
Oh, kitten.

03:02.366 --> 03:04.000
Is that what this is all about?

03:07.403 --> 03:09.805
Remember how afraid
you were of that pony?

03:09.906 --> 03:11.040
You refused to get on

03:11.141 --> 03:12.575
until I promised
to walk by your side

03:12.676 --> 03:13.676
the entire way,

03:13.777 --> 03:15.545
and I ended up walking you
around that circle...

03:15.646 --> 03:16.513
29 times.

03:16.614 --> 03:17.847
I couldn't get you
off the darned thing.

03:19.149 --> 03:20.917
I would walk
a million circles

03:21.019 --> 03:22.686
before I'd ever let any harm
come to you.

03:24.489 --> 03:26.457
I trust Charles.
I think he's good for you.

03:26.558 --> 03:28.192
You make him sound
like a multi-vitamin.

03:29.394 --> 03:32.263
You are stubborn
like your mother.

03:32.364 --> 03:33.264
You know, she didn't
want to have

03:33.365 --> 03:34.432
anything to do with
me at first either.

03:34.533 --> 03:35.700
Thought I was
arrogant.

03:35.801 --> 03:36.701
She was right.

03:36.802 --> 03:37.770
I'll get us
a coffee.

03:40.340 --> 03:41.472
Debbie?

03:47.280 --> 03:48.180
Morning, Mildred.

03:48.281 --> 03:49.916
Looking ravishing
as usual.

03:50.017 --> 03:52.851
Any patients in need
of my medical expertise?

03:52.952 --> 03:54.286
Yeah, the one
that's in for a heart valve.

03:54.387 --> 03:55.889
Ah, kid?

03:55.990 --> 03:57.624
Uh, you could
call him that.

03:57.725 --> 03:58.725
Did he give you
a hard time?

04:00.861 --> 04:02.129
Brandon!

04:02.230 --> 04:03.764
I'm Jack Cooper.

04:03.865 --> 04:05.432
How are you doing?

04:05.533 --> 04:06.499
You tell me.

04:06.600 --> 04:07.500
You're the
know-it-all doctor.

04:07.601 --> 04:08.903
I am not a know-it-all doctor.

04:09.004 --> 04:10.671
First one I've heard
to admit that.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.540
I mean, I'm definitely
a know-it-all,

04:12.641 --> 04:14.543
but not a doctor.

04:14.644 --> 04:15.510
I'm a nurse.

04:15.611 --> 04:16.744
A nurse!

04:17.712 --> 04:18.612
You're, like, a guy.

04:21.216 --> 04:22.451
I'm, like, a guy nurse.

04:22.552 --> 04:24.553
You flunk out of med school,
or what?

04:26.056 --> 04:27.924
That's a good one.

04:28.025 --> 04:29.958
You can laugh,
laugh all you want.

04:30.059 --> 04:31.259
Women love it.

04:31.360 --> 04:32.395
Oh, yeah, I'll bet.

04:32.496 --> 04:34.330
"Daddy, I'd like you to
meet the man of my dreams,

04:34.431 --> 04:35.398
nurse Cooper."

04:38.770 --> 04:40.837
It might behoove you,
young man,

04:40.938 --> 04:41.971
to remember
that I can make your stay here

04:42.072 --> 04:43.974
like the four seasons,

04:44.075 --> 04:45.976
or like the bates motel.

04:46.077 --> 04:46.944
It's your choice.

04:47.045 --> 04:47.945
Okay.

04:48.046 --> 04:49.012
Little sensitive.

04:50.616 --> 04:53.083
I tell you, it's almost better
to be an orderly sometimes.

04:53.184 --> 04:54.318
I mean, no offense.

04:54.419 --> 04:55.285
Oh, none taken.

04:55.386 --> 04:56.688
I know my gig
is sweet.

04:56.789 --> 04:59.424
No one expects you
to be something you're not.

04:59.525 --> 05:00.425
Did you get a load
of your brother

05:00.526 --> 05:02.194
from another mother?

05:02.295 --> 05:04.563
Okay,
we may share the same last name,

05:04.663 --> 05:06.431
but that is where it stops,
my friend.

05:06.532 --> 05:07.900
And that is
tough luck for you.

05:09.803 --> 05:11.237
Oh, man...

05:12.439 --> 05:13.339
Look at him!

05:13.440 --> 05:15.242
He's a total womanizer.

05:15.343 --> 05:17.610
I know, and he's
got no hair

05:17.711 --> 05:20.247
and a horrible case
of halitosis.

05:20.348 --> 05:21.948
And they're still
lining up for him.

05:22.049 --> 05:24.417
You know, it's
a known fact that doctors

05:24.519 --> 05:26.854
are at the top of
the dating food chain.

05:26.955 --> 05:28.788
You put an "m. D." At
the end of your name,

05:28.890 --> 05:29.956
nothing else matters.

05:30.057 --> 05:31.258
An "r. N?"

05:31.359 --> 05:32.760
Not so much.

05:32.861 --> 05:33.794
Dr. j. Thomas Cooper,

05:33.896 --> 05:35.596
please report
to labor and delivery.

05:37.599 --> 05:39.535
I mean,
what is with these women?

05:40.802 --> 05:43.772
Why is it always about power,
prestige and money?

05:43.873 --> 05:45.407
I mean, whatever
happened to love, man?

05:45.508 --> 05:48.243
Love for who we are,
in our souls, as men?

05:48.344 --> 05:49.646
Wow, yeah...

05:49.747 --> 05:51.548
You need to forget
all about that.

05:51.649 --> 05:53.615
You've got to work
with what you got.

05:53.716 --> 05:55.117
Take me, for example.

05:55.218 --> 05:57.620
I've got this awesome
physique, right?

05:57.721 --> 06:00.023
And so, when I
meet a woman,

06:00.124 --> 06:01.558
I tell her that
I'm a pro athlete.

06:03.628 --> 06:04.961
Okay... I'm sorry.

06:05.062 --> 06:06.529
Wait, and she believes you?

06:06.630 --> 06:07.597
Yeah.

06:07.699 --> 06:09.400
She believes me
because she wants to believe.

06:09.501 --> 06:10.768
Yeah, and what happens

06:10.869 --> 06:13.304
when she finds out
that you're not?

06:13.405 --> 06:15.874
Well, I mean, it doesn't
really get that far.

06:15.942 --> 06:17.841
They realize that
they hate my guts

06:17.943 --> 06:19.878
before they figured
out I lied.

06:19.979 --> 06:21.313
Ah, great.

06:21.414 --> 06:22.681
Yeah, it's not
foolproof.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.149
How are we friends?

06:31.123 --> 06:32.959
I'll have another.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.794
On the rocks, sir,
or straight up?

06:36.630 --> 06:38.298
Katherine!
I'm so sorry.

06:42.669 --> 06:43.804
Thank you.

06:45.907 --> 06:48.108
So, what's all this?

06:48.209 --> 06:50.144
A hotel development
in Wisconsin.

06:50.246 --> 06:51.246
I'd love for you
and your father

06:51.347 --> 06:52.213
to be part of it.

06:52.314 --> 06:53.413
Have you shown it to him?

06:53.514 --> 06:54.648
Not yet.

06:54.782 --> 06:56.484
It's still in
its early stages,

06:56.585 --> 06:58.253
but if it works out,

06:58.354 --> 07:00.188
we all stand to make
a small fortune.

07:01.825 --> 07:03.125
Katherine...

07:03.226 --> 07:05.326
Do you realize

07:05.427 --> 07:06.294
it's been six months

07:06.395 --> 07:08.664
since we started
seeing each other?

07:09.666 --> 07:10.532
Has it?

07:10.634 --> 07:12.768
After the Mancini closing.

07:12.869 --> 07:15.438
That dim-witted notary
spilled his coffee on you,

07:15.539 --> 07:17.373
and I lent you
my handkerchief, remember?

07:17.474 --> 07:18.374
Yes, I do.

07:18.475 --> 07:19.976
You went on
to extract

07:20.077 --> 07:21.544
the highest price
per square foot

07:21.646 --> 07:22.612
this city has ever seen.

07:22.713 --> 07:23.747
You were breathtaking.

07:24.849 --> 07:26.150
Oh, this is the lawyer
on the deal

07:26.251 --> 07:27.151
that's closing tomorrow.

07:27.252 --> 07:28.219
Just one second, dear.

07:28.287 --> 07:30.186
I'll be five minutes.
Just go ahead and order.

07:30.288 --> 07:31.154
Kat...

07:31.255 --> 07:32.590
Katherine Benson.

07:32.691 --> 07:34.492
- I...
- Yes, of course.

07:35.794 --> 07:37.596
Let me grab a pen.
We can hash this out.

07:39.000 --> 07:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

07:46.439 --> 07:47.906
Okay.

07:52.146 --> 07:53.312
Well, yeah...

07:54.881 --> 07:56.082
All right, yeah,
give it to him.

07:57.117 --> 07:58.785
Fine, so...

07:58.886 --> 08:00.119
Excuse me?

08:00.220 --> 08:01.588
Could you pack this up
for the lady?

08:01.690 --> 08:02.890
Thank you.

08:06.527 --> 08:07.928
You know,
Katherine,

08:08.029 --> 08:09.997
it's really no problem
at all to drop you home.

08:10.098 --> 08:11.965
Oh, I've got some things
to finish, and...

08:13.034 --> 08:14.402
Well, um...

08:17.372 --> 08:18.339
A small token
of my affection.

08:18.440 --> 08:19.741
Oh, that's... Charles,
that's not necessary.

08:19.842 --> 08:21.476
No, please.
Please.

08:22.812 --> 08:24.713
No, I couldn't possibly...

08:24.814 --> 08:28.351
I know we've kept things
fairly casual up until now,

08:28.451 --> 08:30.018
but when you get the chance,

08:30.119 --> 08:31.954
I'd like you
to put some thought

08:32.054 --> 08:32.922
to our future together.

08:33.023 --> 08:34.289
Our future?

08:35.625 --> 08:37.594
Yeah. In a more
permanent capacity.

08:39.030 --> 08:40.763
- You don't mean...
- Yes...

08:40.864 --> 08:42.698
I'd like you to hold
Friday nights open for me,

08:42.799 --> 08:44.935
and perhaps Sunday brunch,
if possible.

08:47.972 --> 08:49.741
Oh...

08:49.842 --> 08:50.742
Seriously, Katherine,

08:50.843 --> 08:53.076
I want to be your go-to guy,

08:53.177 --> 08:54.411
the one you can depend on
in a pinch,

08:54.512 --> 08:55.847
and maybe even the one
you think of

08:55.914 --> 08:56.948
when you go to sleep at night.

08:57.049 --> 08:59.584
You know, eventually.

08:59.685 --> 09:01.587
That's... very sweet.

09:02.722 --> 09:03.689
Katherine?

09:05.057 --> 09:06.424
I admire you.

09:06.525 --> 09:08.427
You're good for me,
and I...

09:08.528 --> 09:10.429
I know
I could be good for you.

09:11.731 --> 09:13.332
Where did you get that?

09:14.435 --> 09:15.301
What?

09:15.403 --> 09:17.536
That... you're
good for me.

09:17.637 --> 09:19.271
Did my father tell
you to say that?

09:20.307 --> 09:21.174
No.

09:21.275 --> 09:22.175
No, Katherine!

09:22.276 --> 09:24.077
Your father has nothing
to do with this.

09:24.178 --> 09:26.046
Really? Because I feel
like sometimes...

09:35.657 --> 09:37.091
You were saying?

09:39.228 --> 09:41.195
I was... saying...

09:42.831 --> 09:45.100
You are very charming,

09:45.201 --> 09:46.902
and thoughtful,

09:47.003 --> 09:48.270
and one of the
most generous men

09:48.371 --> 09:50.106
I've ever met...

09:51.842 --> 09:54.476
And I will give
your proposal

09:54.577 --> 09:56.712
my utmost consideration.

09:56.814 --> 09:57.914
Thank you, Katherine.

10:01.853 --> 10:02.820
Back to the grindstone.

10:06.957 --> 10:09.126
Good night, my darling.

10:17.202 --> 10:18.168
Dude, we got
a couple of live ones

10:18.269 --> 10:19.169
on the line.

10:19.270 --> 10:20.805
All we have to do
is reel 'em in,

10:20.906 --> 10:22.173
so follow my lead.

10:23.142 --> 10:24.576
Follow my lead.

10:28.514 --> 10:29.380
Hello, ladies.

10:29.482 --> 10:30.381
What's shaking?

10:30.483 --> 10:32.852
Hi, I'm Jack.
This is Reggie.

10:32.953 --> 10:33.853
Oh!

10:33.954 --> 10:35.621
I'm Brooke.
She's angel.

10:35.689 --> 10:36.555
Oh, hello, angel.

10:36.656 --> 10:37.891
Welcome to earth.

10:40.494 --> 10:41.360
What do you do, Jack?

10:41.461 --> 10:42.661
He's a doctor.

10:42.762 --> 10:44.731
He's a renowned
cardiologist

10:44.832 --> 10:46.433
at Chicago west.

10:46.534 --> 10:47.400
That's not entirely...

10:47.502 --> 10:49.370
Oh, don't be modest.

10:49.471 --> 10:51.272
You should be very proud
of yourself.

10:52.406 --> 10:53.907
So have you saved many lives?

10:54.008 --> 10:55.175
Um...

10:55.276 --> 10:56.344
Happens every day.

10:56.445 --> 10:58.145
He once held a living heart
in his own two hands.

10:58.247 --> 10:59.113
No...

10:59.214 --> 11:00.114
Do you
remember that?

11:00.215 --> 11:01.182
You're kidding.

11:01.284 --> 11:03.986
Gosh, I can't even imagine
how that must feel.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.119
Right?

11:05.220 --> 11:06.220
I mean, that must
feel like...

11:06.321 --> 11:08.023
I guess the way I felt

11:08.124 --> 11:09.591
when I scored
that winning touchdown

11:09.692 --> 11:10.592
in super bowl xlv.

11:10.693 --> 11:12.127
Super bowl?

11:12.228 --> 11:13.128
Hmm?

11:13.229 --> 11:14.831
You're a professional
football player?

11:14.932 --> 11:15.798
What?

11:15.900 --> 11:16.999
Oh... well, I mean,
I used to be...

11:17.100 --> 11:17.966
Used to.

11:18.067 --> 11:19.802
Yeah, and then
I blew out my knee,

11:19.904 --> 11:22.238
so... you know,
now I just scout.

11:22.339 --> 11:23.573
Brooke...

11:23.674 --> 11:24.741
You know...

11:24.842 --> 11:26.377
I can't, uh, lie to you.

11:26.478 --> 11:28.211
- Oh, but no...
- I'm actually a...

11:28.312 --> 11:30.346
I am not
a cardiologist.

11:30.447 --> 11:32.349
I'm an r.N.

11:32.417 --> 11:33.517
R.N.?

11:33.618 --> 11:35.352
Really... naughty?

11:37.122 --> 11:38.924
Registered nurse.

11:40.492 --> 11:41.959
But you're going
to become a doctor?

11:42.060 --> 11:42.960
I mean, eventually?

11:43.061 --> 11:44.195
Eventually.

11:44.297 --> 11:46.197
No. Uh, no.

11:46.299 --> 11:47.632
I actually love what I do.

11:47.733 --> 11:49.669
I'm quite proud of it.

11:50.671 --> 11:51.571
Wow!

11:51.672 --> 11:54.105
I mean, that's really...

11:54.206 --> 11:55.441
Amazing.

11:55.542 --> 11:56.976
Yeah!
Thank you.

11:57.044 --> 11:58.678
Oh, hey, um,
we've got to go.

11:58.779 --> 12:00.279
- No, you don't.
- Yeah, we do.

12:00.380 --> 12:01.915
We've got that thing.

12:02.016 --> 12:03.784
Yeah, that... that thing.

12:06.219 --> 12:07.788
I know you don't have
that thing!

12:09.824 --> 12:11.124
Why do you do this?

12:11.225 --> 12:12.192
Got really quiet
in here

12:12.293 --> 12:13.761
all of a sudden.

12:14.730 --> 12:17.097
- Smell that?
- What is that?

12:17.198 --> 12:18.198
Smells like
a train wreck.

12:18.266 --> 12:19.233
That's you
and your lies.

12:19.335 --> 12:20.468
Good one.

12:30.312 --> 12:32.281
You'd save yourself
a hefty mortgage payment

12:32.382 --> 12:33.983
if you'd just admit
you actually live here.

12:36.553 --> 12:37.554
How was your date?

12:38.789 --> 12:39.889
Well...

12:40.957 --> 12:42.091
Oh! Wow.

12:43.093 --> 12:44.094
'Kay...

12:44.195 --> 12:45.895
Holy cow!

12:45.997 --> 12:47.631
What is this for?

12:47.732 --> 12:50.601
I'm guessing an opening bid
for a future corporate merger.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.168
You are so cynical.

12:52.269 --> 12:53.370
Says the dreamer.

12:53.471 --> 12:54.604
There's nothing wrong

12:54.705 --> 12:55.573
with assuming
the best of people.

12:55.674 --> 12:57.475
Unfortunately,
I can't afford to do that.

12:57.576 --> 12:58.743
You have got
to get over

12:58.844 --> 13:00.077
this whole paranoid

13:00.178 --> 13:01.413
"they're all after my
corporate wealth and power"

13:01.514 --> 13:02.414
hang-up.

13:02.515 --> 13:03.448
Easy for you to say.

13:03.549 --> 13:04.649
Oh, really?

13:04.750 --> 13:06.017
You think most guys
are attracted to me

13:06.118 --> 13:07.519
because of my bubbly
personality?

13:07.620 --> 13:09.321
This is the hard
part of dating...

13:09.389 --> 13:11.323
Finding that
one genuine guy

13:11.424 --> 13:13.058
after weeding out
all the fakes.

13:13.160 --> 13:14.694
I hate dating.

13:14.795 --> 13:15.862
All the guys I meet
are so...

13:15.963 --> 13:17.162
Uptight? Boring?
Self-centered?

13:17.263 --> 13:18.597
Yes...

13:18.698 --> 13:19.632
Yeah.

13:19.733 --> 13:20.800
Or completely
intimidated by my career.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.068
You know how I get

13:22.169 --> 13:24.637
those butterflies
and goosebumps

13:24.705 --> 13:25.939
when I'm about
to close a big deal?

13:26.041 --> 13:27.408
You mean the
cramps and the rash?

13:27.509 --> 13:28.441
Whatever.

13:28.542 --> 13:30.943
That's when
I'm feeling challenged

13:31.045 --> 13:32.880
and excited and alive,

13:32.981 --> 13:36.250
and every cell
in my body is tingling.

13:36.351 --> 13:38.453
Why can't I meet a man
who makes me feel like that?

13:38.554 --> 13:40.287
How far are you
willing to go?

13:40.388 --> 13:41.689
I'd consider the suburbs.

13:41.790 --> 13:42.756
Yeah...

13:43.759 --> 13:44.659
Come on.

13:44.760 --> 13:46.094
Come on.

13:50.367 --> 13:51.333
Come on!

13:56.306 --> 13:57.540
Headoverheelsforyou.Com?

13:57.641 --> 13:58.908
What is this?

13:59.009 --> 14:01.445
The newest, hottest Internet
dating service out there.

14:01.546 --> 14:02.813
No, no,
I don't think so.

14:02.914 --> 14:03.914
Yes!

14:04.014 --> 14:05.081
If you want
a real man,

14:05.182 --> 14:06.849
someone different from
all those corporate stiffs,

14:06.950 --> 14:08.752
this is your ticket.

14:09.921 --> 14:10.954
They have an algorithm

14:11.055 --> 14:12.456
that analyzes
your detailed profile

14:12.557 --> 14:14.058
to help you find
your perfect match.

14:14.159 --> 14:16.026
What if someone I know
sees me on this site?

14:16.127 --> 14:17.661
I'd be the laughing stock
of the business world.

14:17.762 --> 14:18.929
No...

14:19.030 --> 14:19.964
Your identity is kept
completely private.

14:20.065 --> 14:20.965
They only release it

14:21.066 --> 14:21.933
to the guys they
match you with.

14:22.034 --> 14:23.367
One of those guys?

14:23.469 --> 14:24.936
What if they match me
with one who's a fake?

14:25.037 --> 14:26.171
Mm?

14:26.272 --> 14:28.639
And then he's after money,
or the company...

14:29.942 --> 14:31.076
You use an alias...

14:31.177 --> 14:33.145
Or better yet,
you pretend you're me...

14:33.246 --> 14:36.482
An underpaid office worker
waiting for her white knight

14:36.583 --> 14:38.985
to perform a hostile takeover.

14:39.086 --> 14:40.119
Trust me.

14:40.186 --> 14:41.086
No excuses.

14:41.187 --> 14:42.454
No, it's all too complicated.

14:42.522 --> 14:43.790
No, it's very simple.

14:43.891 --> 14:45.759
I'll walk you
through it.

14:45.860 --> 14:46.726
Name...

14:46.827 --> 14:47.827
Debbie.

14:47.928 --> 14:49.697
Age...

14:49.798 --> 14:50.798
Hey!

14:51.966 --> 14:52.999
Sorry.

14:53.100 --> 14:54.067
I get confused on that one.

14:55.370 --> 14:58.639
Occupation...
Executive assistant.

14:59.641 --> 15:00.508
Favorite food...

15:00.609 --> 15:01.843
You have to be kidding me.

15:02.812 --> 15:03.978
Black coffee.

15:04.946 --> 15:06.680
Great.

15:07.984 --> 15:10.819
This seems underhanded,
the lying...

15:10.920 --> 15:12.187
Well, how else are we going
to know

15:12.288 --> 15:13.589
they're in it
for you and you alone?

15:13.690 --> 15:14.557
I know, but...

15:14.658 --> 15:15.658
No, no, no,

15:15.759 --> 15:17.058
it's not like you're going
to keep your identity

15:17.160 --> 15:18.093
hidden from him forever.

15:18.194 --> 15:19.395
You will tell him...

15:19.496 --> 15:20.363
Once you're sure
he's the one.

15:20.464 --> 15:21.731
And what happens
when he finds out

15:21.832 --> 15:22.965
I've lied to him?

15:23.066 --> 15:24.600
Well, he'll realize

15:24.701 --> 15:26.503
not only did he get
the woman of his dreams,

15:26.604 --> 15:28.838
but surprise!

15:28.939 --> 15:30.506
As an added bonus,
she's loaded.

15:30.607 --> 15:31.742
Trust me,
he won't be disappointed.

15:31.843 --> 15:32.910
Okay, wait, wait, wait!

15:33.011 --> 15:34.912
No... oh!

15:35.013 --> 15:36.947
Sorry, too late.

15:38.384 --> 15:39.284
This is going to be
so much fun.

15:39.385 --> 15:40.250
Out of my chair.

15:40.351 --> 15:41.685
Okay.

15:43.756 --> 15:44.823
Okay.

15:46.692 --> 15:48.092
Occupation.

15:48.194 --> 15:50.796
Like the great philosopher
popeye once said,

15:50.897 --> 15:51.930
"I yam what I yam."

15:53.399 --> 15:54.732
Right? That was terrible.

15:54.834 --> 15:56.335
Hi.

15:56.436 --> 15:57.536
Hi.

15:57.637 --> 15:58.504
I'm meeting ox
for midnight bowling

15:58.605 --> 16:00.172
at brothers bowling.

16:00.273 --> 16:01.174
Want to come?

16:01.275 --> 16:02.142
Nope. I'm busy.

16:02.243 --> 16:03.443
Two for one drinks.

16:03.544 --> 16:04.510
Still busy.

16:05.512 --> 16:06.412
Internet dating?

16:06.513 --> 16:07.380
Mm-hmm.

16:07.481 --> 16:08.982
You didn't tell them
your real job.

16:09.083 --> 16:10.684
Of course I did.

16:12.186 --> 16:15.423
This things don't work
unless you're honest.

16:15.524 --> 16:17.390
I'm telling you,
women want doctors, not nurses.

16:17.491 --> 16:18.558
You know what?

16:18.659 --> 16:20.161
I am done, actually,
with your advice, but thank you.

16:20.262 --> 16:21.095
I'm going to do things
the way that I want to

16:21.196 --> 16:22.096
from now on.

16:22.197 --> 16:23.664
That's fine.
Whatever.

16:23.765 --> 16:24.632
Mm-hmm.

16:24.733 --> 16:27.169
Hey, could I borrow...

16:27.270 --> 16:28.135
No.

16:28.237 --> 16:29.103
Your bowling shoes?

16:29.204 --> 16:30.538
No.

16:30.639 --> 16:31.640
'Cause, I mean,
these rentals,

16:31.741 --> 16:33.542
they fall even below
my standards of hygiene.

16:33.643 --> 16:34.509
That's saying something.

16:34.611 --> 16:36.078
Your feet stink.

16:36.179 --> 16:37.146
Yeah.

16:38.449 --> 16:39.382
All right, I'll wear socks.

16:40.884 --> 16:41.783
Huh?

16:41.885 --> 16:43.553
Yeah, you want to.
Come on.

16:43.654 --> 16:44.621
Wear socks.

16:45.956 --> 16:47.223
Thank you.

16:48.192 --> 16:49.193
Mwah!

16:52.763 --> 16:54.230
Hey, can I borrow
some socks?

17:00.138 --> 17:01.006
What?

17:01.107 --> 17:02.307
He'll thank me some day.

17:15.155 --> 17:16.121
Submitted your profile!

17:16.222 --> 17:17.155
What?

17:17.256 --> 17:18.623
You're welcome!

17:21.194 --> 17:22.929
Good morning!

17:23.030 --> 17:24.730
Katherine!

17:24.830 --> 17:26.934
I'm just working on
today's schedule.

17:27.035 --> 17:29.402
Oh. Well...
Nice try.

17:29.503 --> 17:30.636
I'm sorry.

17:30.737 --> 17:32.205
I just couldn't wait.

17:32.307 --> 17:33.240
I feel like a kid
on Christmas morning.

17:33.341 --> 17:34.207
Well, that's fine.

17:34.309 --> 17:35.542
You can forget
about the whole thing

17:35.610 --> 17:36.810
because I'm going
to cancel my registration.

17:36.912 --> 17:37.779
What? No, no,
you can't.

17:37.880 --> 17:38.780
I won't let you.

17:38.881 --> 17:39.747
Get... okay,
I'm the boss!

17:39.847 --> 17:40.747
Give it to me.
Give it to me!

17:40.848 --> 17:41.748
Aren't you even
curious to see

17:41.849 --> 17:42.783
who they matched you with?

17:44.420 --> 17:45.553
I've been matched already?

17:45.654 --> 17:47.155
To, like, 10 guys.

17:49.092 --> 17:50.059
Yeah.

17:51.394 --> 17:52.894
Now, first,
what we need to do

17:52.962 --> 17:53.895
is narrow
the playing field,

17:53.996 --> 17:55.130
okay?

17:55.231 --> 17:56.098
For instance,

17:56.199 --> 17:57.099
you don't want a guy

17:57.200 --> 17:58.100
that doesn't
submit a photo.

17:58.201 --> 17:59.101
Total red flag.

18:00.236 --> 18:01.738
And you don't want a guy
that looks too polished.

18:01.839 --> 18:05.607
He's obviously used Photoshop
or is way too into himself.

18:05.709 --> 18:06.742
But, but...

18:06.844 --> 18:09.713
Same goes
for this guy...

18:09.814 --> 18:10.780
This guy... him...

18:10.881 --> 18:12.349
- Wait...
- And him.

18:12.450 --> 18:13.784
Yeah... also, him.

18:14.853 --> 18:15.885
Okay,

18:15.987 --> 18:19.290
now we're left with a doctor
and a lawyer.

18:20.459 --> 18:21.659
I mean, it wouldn't hurt

18:21.760 --> 18:24.695
to take both of them
out for a little test drive.

18:24.796 --> 18:26.365
I don't know, there's something
about that one.

18:27.367 --> 18:28.265
See, there's something
in his eyes.

18:28.367 --> 18:30.001
He looks...

18:30.102 --> 18:32.004
He looks sincere.

18:32.071 --> 18:32.971
Okay...

18:35.375 --> 18:38.811
Now we just wait and see
if he wants to meet you.

18:40.947 --> 18:42.080
Okay.

18:43.450 --> 18:44.917
Which he will. Yeah.

18:48.057 --> 18:49.491
Hello, Mildred.

18:49.592 --> 18:50.491
Hey, babe.

18:50.592 --> 18:51.492
Aw, hon,

18:51.593 --> 18:52.560
is your arthritis
acting up again?

18:52.661 --> 18:53.529
Yeah.

18:53.630 --> 18:54.796
Let me see.

18:54.898 --> 18:55.831
Whoever marries you

18:55.932 --> 18:57.766
is going to be the
luckiest girl on earth.

18:59.235 --> 19:00.103
Thanks, Millie.

19:00.204 --> 19:01.971
Don't worry.
You'll find her.

19:02.072 --> 19:04.239
Oh, Mr. schmidt's
at it again.

19:04.340 --> 19:06.643
Send a rescue party
if I'm not back in five.

19:06.744 --> 19:07.610
Be a sweetheart.

19:07.711 --> 19:08.578
Would you enter
this guy for me

19:08.679 --> 19:09.579
while you're at it?

19:09.680 --> 19:10.647
You got it!

19:13.251 --> 19:14.484
Say hi.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.291
<i>Dr. Pearson,</i>
<i>please report to emergency.</i>

19:28.333 --> 19:29.634
Call me crazy,

19:29.735 --> 19:30.602
but those don't look
like cardiac patients to me.

19:30.703 --> 19:31.903
Shh, shh, shh!

19:32.038 --> 19:32.871
These are my matches.

19:32.972 --> 19:33.939
What, from your dating website?

19:34.040 --> 19:35.040
Uh-huh.

19:35.141 --> 19:37.410
Sweet!
So...

19:38.844 --> 19:40.712
All of these women
want to date you?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.248
Yes.

19:42.349 --> 19:43.382
I guess
not all women

19:43.483 --> 19:45.117
are into money
and status after all.

19:45.218 --> 19:46.819
Looks like telling
the truth pays off,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.288
doesn't it?

19:48.389 --> 19:49.656
Well, my apologies.

19:49.757 --> 19:51.190
I was dead wrong.

19:53.661 --> 19:54.928
Look at
that dental hygienist.

19:55.029 --> 19:56.296
Wow... those
are not real.

19:56.397 --> 19:57.297
What?

19:57.398 --> 19:58.265
No. Look it...

19:58.366 --> 19:59.400
No one has teeth
like that.

19:59.501 --> 20:00.868
They've got
to be capped.

20:02.037 --> 20:03.904
This lawyer's cute.

20:04.005 --> 20:05.907
Naw, no, you want
something more fun.

20:06.008 --> 20:07.742
Yeah, like this one.

20:07.843 --> 20:09.277
Are you serious?

20:09.378 --> 20:10.678
Yeah, that's classy.

20:11.681 --> 20:13.248
Whoa, how about
this executive assistant?

20:13.350 --> 20:14.916
Maybe...

20:16.619 --> 20:17.620
There's something
in her eyes.

20:17.721 --> 20:19.421
I mean, she looks
way different

20:19.522 --> 20:20.489
than the rest
of them, right?

20:20.590 --> 20:23.426
It's like she has
something... real,

20:23.527 --> 20:25.495
like she would want to do
the things that I want to do...

20:25.596 --> 20:26.695
Like camping and baseball...

20:26.763 --> 20:27.796
Knitting.

20:29.634 --> 20:30.834
Look at this!

20:30.935 --> 20:32.669
She loves dogs.

20:32.770 --> 20:34.704
She said, "I had a great Dane
when I was a kid."

20:35.674 --> 20:36.574
How about that?

20:36.675 --> 20:38.575
Must be kismet.

20:38.676 --> 20:41.479
Well, you've got to
start somewhere, right?

20:41.580 --> 20:43.047
I'm keeping this.

20:45.050 --> 20:48.153
Strike paragraph 75,

20:48.254 --> 20:51.355
part b, subpart three.

20:51.456 --> 20:52.356
We've never dealt away
our right of first refusal

20:52.457 --> 20:53.325
in a deal like this,

20:53.426 --> 20:54.326
and we don't intend to.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.293
But the letter of intent
clearly states...

20:55.395 --> 20:56.361
Katherine!

20:58.798 --> 21:01.200
Ms. Benson,
you have an urgent phone call.

21:01.301 --> 21:02.234
Take a message.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.136
But it's your doctor...

21:04.237 --> 21:05.672
Calling with the results.

21:06.940 --> 21:08.808
Results?

21:09.943 --> 21:11.010
Katherine, hey,

21:11.111 --> 21:12.546
if you have a medical matter
you have to attend to...

21:12.647 --> 21:13.514
No, I'm fine,
thank you.

21:13.615 --> 21:14.814
Um...

21:16.016 --> 21:17.418
Oh!

21:17.519 --> 21:18.585
Oh, those results.

21:20.088 --> 21:21.722
Okay, um...

21:21.823 --> 21:23.625
One moment, gentlemen.

21:30.266 --> 21:32.567
Now, don't panic.
Play it cool.

21:32.668 --> 21:33.735
I am a seasoned negotiator.

21:33.836 --> 21:35.171
I don't play it cool.
I am cool.

21:41.445 --> 21:42.912
Katherine Benson here.

21:43.013 --> 21:44.213
<i>Wait, who?</i>

21:44.314 --> 21:45.514
I am Debbie celvin...

21:45.615 --> 21:47.184
The assistant
to Katherine Benson,

21:47.285 --> 21:48.351
who I am not.

21:48.453 --> 21:49.352
<i>Hi!</i>

21:49.454 --> 21:51.020
I am Jack.

21:51.121 --> 21:53.957
We... we matched
on head over heels for you.

21:54.025 --> 21:55.225
Hi! Yes.

21:55.326 --> 21:56.793
- Hi, Jack.
- It's him!

21:56.894 --> 21:57.861
I know!

21:57.962 --> 21:59.062
<i>Hello</i> ?

21:59.164 --> 22:00.631
Is... is anybody there?

22:00.733 --> 22:03.734
Sorry,
I'm a little...

22:03.835 --> 22:04.901
Unprepared.

22:05.002 --> 22:06.170
This is the first
time I've ever done

22:06.271 --> 22:08.473
any Internet dating thing.

22:08.574 --> 22:09.574
Me too! I know.

22:09.675 --> 22:10.975
<i>It's crazy, huh?</i>

22:11.077 --> 22:11.944
I know.

22:12.045 --> 22:12.911
What people won't
do for love.

22:13.012 --> 22:15.913
I don't mean love,
necessarily.

22:16.014 --> 22:17.716
<i>Not yet anyway.</i>
<i>Maybe not ever!</i>

22:18.885 --> 22:20.953
<i>I get,</i>
<i>i get what you mean.</i>

22:21.054 --> 22:22.354
I mean, no pressure.

22:22.455 --> 22:23.890
We'll just meet in person,

22:23.991 --> 22:25.892
and just take it from there,
see how it goes.

22:25.992 --> 22:27.126
Great.

22:27.227 --> 22:28.327
Exactly. Perfect.

22:28.428 --> 22:29.562
He's nice!

22:29.663 --> 22:31.464
<i>So I was wondering, um,</i>

22:31.565 --> 22:33.967
are you free
this Saturday night?

22:34.068 --> 22:35.536
I know this really great place
I think maybe we could go...

22:35.637 --> 22:38.338
This Saturday?
Um...

22:38.439 --> 22:40.373
I would have
to check my schedule.

22:41.710 --> 22:44.912
Works for us.
Me. Alone.

22:45.013 --> 22:48.483
<i>Except hopefully with you</i>
<i>at the time of the date.</i>

22:48.584 --> 22:50.751
<i>Maybe not like a "date date,"</i>
<i>but...</i>

22:50.852 --> 22:52.319
Okay!

22:52.420 --> 22:53.855
<i>Where should I pick you up?</i>

22:53.956 --> 22:55.023
You know,

22:55.124 --> 22:56.391
it'd be better
if I met you.

22:57.860 --> 22:58.860
Okay.

22:58.961 --> 23:01.864
How's 7:00,
950 South halstrom sound?

23:01.964 --> 23:02.964
7:00.

23:03.065 --> 23:05.134
That is a definite...
"Can do."

23:06.970 --> 23:08.137
'Kay, bye.

23:08.238 --> 23:10.439
Okay, bye.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.545
It's not easy
being you.

23:15.646 --> 23:16.746
Okay.

23:23.989 --> 23:26.223
You're not wearing
your business suit, are you?

23:26.324 --> 23:28.258
No.
I bought jeans.

23:28.326 --> 23:30.461
You didn't press them,
did you?

23:32.665 --> 23:33.565
Of course not.

23:33.666 --> 23:35.601
And what about
your hair and makeup?

23:35.669 --> 23:37.403
<i>What about them?</i>

23:37.504 --> 23:39.337
Honestly?
Uh...

23:39.438 --> 23:41.207
Your hair looks like
a German world war ii helmet,

23:41.308 --> 23:44.109
<i>and you're way too heavy</i>
<i>on the makeup.</i>

23:44.211 --> 23:45.911
It's very intimidating to men.

23:46.012 --> 23:47.647
Yeah, okay.

23:47.748 --> 23:48.682
Gotta go.

24:00.195 --> 24:01.162
Debbie?

24:02.563 --> 24:04.497
Hi, uh, Debbie?

24:04.599 --> 24:05.700
Yes! Hi!
That's...

24:05.801 --> 24:06.868
Yeah, I'm Debbie.
That's me. Hi.

24:06.969 --> 24:08.502
I'm Jack.

24:08.604 --> 24:09.570
Come on in!

24:11.541 --> 24:13.308
Are you ready
to have some fun?

24:13.409 --> 24:15.877
Uh... yeah.
Well, yeah.

24:19.182 --> 24:21.183
Mm, smell those brats.

24:21.284 --> 24:22.384
Is that
what that is?

24:24.121 --> 24:25.255
Right here.

24:25.356 --> 24:26.722
Okay.

24:26.823 --> 24:28.457
Hey, Jack!
This your old lady?

24:28.558 --> 24:29.993
Uh, no.

24:30.094 --> 24:31.494
Just a friend.

24:31.595 --> 24:33.496
Well, any friend
of yours...

24:33.597 --> 24:35.199
Is a friend
of ours.

24:35.300 --> 24:36.600
Okay, guys.

24:36.701 --> 24:38.134
Just... let's
keep it clean.

24:39.370 --> 24:42.373
I'm sorry
about the rentals.

24:42.474 --> 24:44.942
I forgot to mention to you
we were bowling,

24:45.043 --> 24:46.243
or you could've brought
your own.

24:46.344 --> 24:47.846
Oh...

24:47.947 --> 24:49.114
Um...

24:50.982 --> 24:52.349
I have socks.

24:55.354 --> 24:56.721
Let me help you
with this one.

24:56.822 --> 24:58.089
Okay.

24:58.190 --> 24:59.625
Okay.

25:00.961 --> 25:01.826
You've got this.

25:01.928 --> 25:03.595
Just have fun,

25:03.696 --> 25:05.031
and give it your best shot.

25:06.700 --> 25:07.700
Right.

25:18.479 --> 25:20.347
Fun.
Fun...

25:30.960 --> 25:31.826
Oop...

25:31.927 --> 25:32.927
Oh!

25:40.035 --> 25:41.870
Player down in Lane four.

25:41.972 --> 25:43.072
Ow!

25:43.173 --> 25:44.840
Oh, no!

25:44.941 --> 25:46.108
Did you get hurt?

25:46.209 --> 25:47.911
My elbow!

25:48.012 --> 25:49.612
Ow, this one.

25:49.680 --> 25:50.879
I got you, I got you.

25:50.981 --> 25:51.880
Yeah!

25:51.982 --> 25:52.849
It's good.

25:52.950 --> 25:54.117
I like that.
That's good.

25:54.218 --> 25:56.553
Okay.

25:58.255 --> 25:59.390
Come on, Deb.
You can do this.

25:59.491 --> 26:00.458
You got this!

26:00.559 --> 26:01.958
Shh!

26:03.761 --> 26:04.794
Come on, Debbie!

26:04.896 --> 26:06.564
Let her concentrate!

26:14.272 --> 26:15.206
Come on...

26:15.307 --> 26:16.173
Come on.

26:16.274 --> 26:17.642
There we go!

26:21.547 --> 26:23.483
Amazing! Wow!

26:23.584 --> 26:25.351
Nice work!

26:25.452 --> 26:27.652
Very good!
Very good.

26:29.456 --> 26:30.423
Well!
Nicely done.

26:33.627 --> 26:35.029
Very nice of the guys
to give this to me.

26:35.130 --> 26:36.563
Yeah... it was.

26:38.132 --> 26:39.098
Here, let me
give you your coat.

26:39.199 --> 26:40.166
Oh.

26:41.169 --> 26:42.069
Is it still hurting?

26:42.170 --> 26:44.238
Yeah...
When I bend it.

26:44.339 --> 26:45.973
Wiggle your fingers
a bit.

26:46.074 --> 26:47.342
Does that hurt?

26:47.443 --> 26:49.077
No.

26:50.178 --> 26:53.014
Is there any numbness
or tingling?

26:53.115 --> 26:54.382
Um...

26:54.483 --> 26:55.417
Tingling.

26:55.518 --> 26:57.352
Uh-huh.

26:57.453 --> 26:58.653
It's definitely not broken.

26:58.755 --> 27:00.122
Well, you would know.

27:03.392 --> 27:05.494
If you ice it tonight
and some ibuprofen,

27:05.595 --> 27:06.462
it'll feel better.

27:06.563 --> 27:08.164
Okay.

27:10.033 --> 27:12.969
So, what do you do
as an executive assistant?

27:14.638 --> 27:15.871
I work for the president

27:15.972 --> 27:17.641
of a real estate
investment firm.

27:17.742 --> 27:19.709
The president.

27:19.811 --> 27:20.777
You must be good.

27:20.878 --> 27:24.215
I am. I am.

27:24.316 --> 27:25.816
Your boss,
what is he like?

27:27.285 --> 27:28.485
He is a she,

27:28.586 --> 27:30.154
and...

27:30.222 --> 27:31.589
She helped build
the company

27:31.690 --> 27:33.224
from the ground up.

27:33.292 --> 27:35.360
Wow, that's impressive.

27:35.462 --> 27:37.262
Is she married?

27:39.765 --> 27:40.933
No. Why?

27:41.034 --> 27:42.101
I don't know.

27:42.202 --> 27:44.269
You hear about
these business executives

27:44.370 --> 27:45.971
that just work
and work,

27:46.072 --> 27:48.108
and they have no time
for family

27:48.209 --> 27:49.442
or for social life.

27:49.543 --> 27:51.210
I mean, that's got
to take a toll

27:51.311 --> 27:53.113
on relationships.

27:54.949 --> 27:57.183
Yeah, Katherine's
not really like that.

27:57.284 --> 27:58.752
That's good.

28:00.856 --> 28:02.956
This is me here.

28:03.057 --> 28:03.957
That is you.

28:04.058 --> 28:05.593
Yeah.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.463
I really like your hair
like... like that.

28:09.564 --> 28:10.732
Thank you!

28:10.833 --> 28:13.468
I'll be sure to wear it
like this next time.

28:13.568 --> 28:15.436
I'm...
I'm not assuming...

28:15.537 --> 28:18.373
I really hope
there is a next time.

28:19.909 --> 28:21.710
I do, too.

28:53.213 --> 28:54.681
"Debbie."

28:57.452 --> 28:59.353
"Roses are red
and violets are blue,

28:59.454 --> 29:02.955
"not even pros
can throw a strike like you.

29:03.057 --> 29:04.258
Jack."

29:04.359 --> 29:05.993
That's terrible.

29:06.094 --> 29:07.461
What's terrible?

29:07.562 --> 29:10.098
Oh, spilled some water.

29:10.199 --> 29:12.499
Oh, things are going well
with Charles, I see.

29:12.600 --> 29:13.934
Things with Charles

29:14.035 --> 29:15.370
could not be
going any better.

29:15.471 --> 29:17.439
Excellent.
Keep up the good work.

29:18.774 --> 29:20.141
What are these things?

29:20.242 --> 29:23.012
Oh, those are
for Debbie.

29:23.113 --> 29:24.079
They put them
in here by mistake.

29:24.180 --> 29:25.747
That guy needs
a new florist.

29:25.848 --> 29:27.817
Here, let me get that.

29:27.918 --> 29:29.218
There.

29:50.174 --> 29:52.376
Good morning, buddy.

29:52.478 --> 29:54.545
How did you sleep?

29:54.646 --> 29:56.080
If it isn't
little miss sunshine.

29:58.451 --> 30:00.551
You ever heard of
something called "karma"?

30:00.652 --> 30:02.353
What about it?

30:02.454 --> 30:05.023
This venom
you're spewing...

30:05.125 --> 30:06.125
It's not going
to help you

30:06.226 --> 30:07.426
in the long run.

30:07.527 --> 30:09.095
Maybe I don't need to worry
so much about the "long-run."

30:09.196 --> 30:10.363
See?
There it is.

30:10.464 --> 30:12.765
That's what I'm talking about.

30:12.866 --> 30:15.869
A good attitude
might help you beat this thing.

30:15.970 --> 30:17.270
The doctor said

30:17.371 --> 30:18.638
a new heart valve
will help me beat this thing.

30:20.007 --> 30:20.907
Your parents know
you play this?

30:21.008 --> 30:22.476
Yeah, they bought it for me.
Helps me...

30:22.577 --> 30:23.677
Distracts me
from my problems.

30:23.779 --> 30:26.379
When's the last time
you read a book?

30:26.480 --> 30:28.182
Yeah, right.

30:30.952 --> 30:32.953
<i>Hey, Kim, what's up?</i>

30:33.055 --> 30:34.489
There's a guy here
to see you.

30:35.891 --> 30:36.757
Who is it?

30:36.858 --> 30:38.826
Says he's a friend of yours.

30:40.396 --> 30:41.563
17th floor.

30:41.664 --> 30:43.265
Okay, thanks.

30:52.709 --> 30:54.110
May I help you?

30:54.211 --> 30:55.111
Hi!

30:55.212 --> 30:57.447
I'm here to see
Debbie celvin.

30:57.549 --> 30:58.916
I'm Debbie...

30:59.917 --> 31:01.150
...celvin's boss.

31:01.251 --> 31:02.752
You're Debbie's boss?

31:02.853 --> 31:04.021
Mm-hmm!

31:04.122 --> 31:05.956
Katherine Benson, yup.

31:06.057 --> 31:09.527
President of, uh,
Benson alliance inc.

31:09.628 --> 31:10.562
Okay.

31:10.663 --> 31:11.995
Debbie's in
a meeting right now,

31:12.096 --> 31:16.067
an assistants' meeting
of all the assistants,

31:16.168 --> 31:17.435
but I can pull her out...

31:17.536 --> 31:18.736
Because I am the boss.

31:18.838 --> 31:21.473
So just wait
over here,

31:21.575 --> 31:22.541
and I'll go get her.

31:24.009 --> 31:25.276
Don't go anywhere.

31:25.377 --> 31:26.444
Okay.

31:31.284 --> 31:32.318
Oh, my gosh!
He's here!

31:32.419 --> 31:33.386
Who's here?

31:36.289 --> 31:37.723
Mr. Hodges...

31:37.824 --> 31:39.292
I didn't know
you were...

31:41.329 --> 31:44.564
It's the decorator...
For the reception area.

31:44.665 --> 31:47.001
He wants to show you
some paint samples.

31:47.102 --> 31:48.301
I thought you already had
the reception area done?

31:48.402 --> 31:49.870
We did.

31:49.971 --> 31:51.339
Yes, well...

31:51.440 --> 31:53.507
Katherine, uh, really
doesn't like the color.

31:53.609 --> 31:54.876
Makes her nauseous.

31:54.977 --> 31:55.843
So... I'll have her back
in a jiffy.

31:55.944 --> 31:56.945
Yep. Come on.

31:58.781 --> 32:00.114
Since when does beige

32:00.215 --> 32:01.148
make anyone dizzy?

32:01.250 --> 32:03.118
Sometimes,
you can be so dense.

32:04.254 --> 32:05.220
Okay.

32:05.321 --> 32:06.221
He's here, he's cute,

32:06.322 --> 32:07.890
and if you mess this up,
he's mine.

32:07.991 --> 32:09.792
Jack?
Jack is here?

32:09.894 --> 32:11.127
Yes, in the reception area.

32:11.228 --> 32:12.961
I will take care
of Charles, and, uh...

32:14.130 --> 32:16.466
I may have told him
that I am your boss, so...

32:16.567 --> 32:18.067
- What?
- Yeah. It's okay. Go.

32:18.168 --> 32:19.602
You're good.

32:19.703 --> 32:20.770
Gorgeous.
Looking great.

32:20.871 --> 32:21.872
'Kay.

32:24.475 --> 32:25.341
Oh, God!

32:25.442 --> 32:26.542
Yeah.

32:28.446 --> 32:29.446
Hey there.

32:30.982 --> 32:32.182
Great tie.

32:32.284 --> 32:33.285
Thank you.

32:42.628 --> 32:44.496
[Katherine laughs,
clears throat.

32:44.597 --> 32:45.498
Hi!

32:45.599 --> 32:46.465
Hi! Jack!

32:46.566 --> 32:48.166
Uh, what a surprise.

32:48.267 --> 32:50.937
I didn't get you in trouble
with your boss, did I?

32:51.038 --> 32:52.104
No, no. No.

32:52.172 --> 32:53.439
It's... fine.

32:55.108 --> 32:56.776
Did you get
my flowers?

32:56.878 --> 32:59.012
Yes! Thank you.

32:59.113 --> 33:00.713
They're beautiful.

33:00.814 --> 33:01.847
You're welcome.

33:01.949 --> 33:03.684
Um, hey, did you want

33:03.785 --> 33:05.552
to go grab a bite
to eat with me?

33:05.653 --> 33:07.054
There's a place I know
that's great,

33:07.155 --> 33:08.021
and it's really close.

33:08.122 --> 33:09.991
Oh! Um...

33:10.059 --> 33:11.426
I'm not ready
to quit for the night.

33:11.527 --> 33:12.426
I have, uh...

33:12.527 --> 33:13.527
That's okay.

33:13.628 --> 33:14.795
I'll wait.

33:14.897 --> 33:15.763
What time do you get off?

33:15.864 --> 33:17.699
I've really got to work

33:17.800 --> 33:19.334
on this deal
that's closing, so...

33:19.435 --> 33:20.601
It can wait.

33:22.539 --> 33:23.539
No, it can't.

33:23.640 --> 33:24.572
Yes, it can.

33:24.673 --> 33:26.274
Remember, I am
the boss of you,

33:26.375 --> 33:29.678
and what I say goes.

33:29.779 --> 33:30.813
I work her
to the bone,

33:30.914 --> 33:32.247
and she really deserves
a night out.

33:33.517 --> 33:35.418
So get out of here,
you two.

33:35.519 --> 33:36.919
And you can thank me
tomorrow...

33:37.020 --> 33:38.153
If you decide
to come in.

33:39.156 --> 33:40.090
Thank you, miss, uh...

33:40.191 --> 33:41.958
No "Benson" here.

33:42.059 --> 33:44.160
Call me Katherine,
or better yet, "Katie."

33:44.261 --> 33:45.796
- Thank you, Katie.
- Yeah.

33:45.897 --> 33:47.231
- 'Kay.
- Get out!

33:47.332 --> 33:48.465
Okay, thanks, Katie!

33:48.566 --> 33:49.699
Get your horse
and carriage.

33:49.800 --> 33:52.803
Get out of here,
you cute kids.

33:52.904 --> 33:53.771
You look great
together.

33:53.872 --> 33:55.239
I love
what's happening.

33:57.377 --> 34:01.012
What a tangled web we weave.

34:04.951 --> 34:06.451
When I was a kid,

34:06.552 --> 34:08.553
I used to go to work
with my dad on Saturdays,

34:08.654 --> 34:10.623
and we would come
here for lunch.

34:10.724 --> 34:12.357
Oh, what does he do?

34:12.458 --> 34:13.759
He used to be
a typesetter

34:13.860 --> 34:15.962
for the "Chicago tribune,"

34:16.063 --> 34:17.897
but him and my mom
both passed.

34:17.998 --> 34:19.431
Oh, I'm sorry.

34:19.500 --> 34:20.500
It's okay.

34:21.703 --> 34:23.902
He would have so much ink
on his hands,

34:24.004 --> 34:26.371
that no matter what he tried,
he couldn't get it off.

34:26.473 --> 34:27.474
He'd get so embarrassed

34:27.574 --> 34:29.043
that he would have to put them
in his pockets.

34:29.143 --> 34:30.511
Aw...

34:30.612 --> 34:33.514
Yeah... and he said to me
that I have to find a job

34:33.616 --> 34:35.150
where I would never
have to get my hands dirty.

34:37.152 --> 34:38.185
Oh!

34:38.286 --> 34:39.554
Well, he must have been
very proud of you.

34:40.956 --> 34:41.856
He was.

34:45.128 --> 34:46.829
Everything okay?

34:46.929 --> 34:48.329
You haven't touched your food.

34:48.431 --> 34:50.031
Oh! Yeah.

34:50.132 --> 34:52.234
I'm just missing silverware.

34:52.302 --> 34:54.103
Oh-ho-ho...

34:54.204 --> 34:55.504
Oh, no.

34:55.605 --> 34:57.174
You've got to eat
with your hands.

34:57.275 --> 34:58.675
It's the house rules.

34:58.776 --> 35:00.676
Okay, this is
how it's done.

35:00.777 --> 35:01.644
Okay...

35:01.745 --> 35:02.645
Take a piece,
you dunk,

35:02.747 --> 35:03.747
like this.

35:03.848 --> 35:04.748
Mm!

35:04.849 --> 35:05.782
Now you.

35:05.883 --> 35:07.084
Even just
a plastic fork is...

35:07.185 --> 35:09.020
Okay...

35:09.121 --> 35:10.688
Trust me.

35:10.789 --> 35:13.323
It tastes
so much better like this.

35:13.424 --> 35:15.460
Just... go for it.

35:15.561 --> 35:16.761
Okay...
Okay, okay.

35:19.832 --> 35:20.699
Mm-hmm, take a piece.

35:20.800 --> 35:21.700
And, uh...

35:21.801 --> 35:23.668
Take a dunk.
You dunk it.

35:23.769 --> 35:25.236
Uh-huh.

35:25.337 --> 35:26.637
Yup...

35:26.739 --> 35:28.340
And then
have at it.

35:28.441 --> 35:30.008
I don't even know what...

35:30.110 --> 35:31.910
Just go for it.
Just go for it!

35:32.011 --> 35:33.146
Yeah!

35:34.515 --> 35:35.981
Mm!

35:36.082 --> 35:37.282
Oh, my goodness!

35:37.383 --> 35:38.283
Oh, it's so good!

35:38.351 --> 35:41.121
See? See?
I told you.

35:47.996 --> 35:49.130
Um...

35:49.231 --> 35:51.867
Well, I had better
get back to it.

35:51.968 --> 35:52.834
Really?

35:52.935 --> 35:53.869
Yeah.

35:53.970 --> 35:56.205
Yeah, your boss
is long-gone, no?

35:56.306 --> 35:57.740
Oh, no. No...

35:57.841 --> 35:59.274
You don't know her.

35:59.375 --> 36:01.176
She's, uh...

36:01.277 --> 36:03.012
She practically lives here.

36:03.113 --> 36:04.947
That's a shame.

36:05.048 --> 36:07.918
Do you ever go all
the way up to the top?

36:07.986 --> 36:09.953
Yeah, um...

36:10.054 --> 36:12.121
I think I was
about eight.

36:13.624 --> 36:14.958
No way!

36:15.059 --> 36:16.827
You work in this
building every day,

36:16.895 --> 36:18.362
and you don't go
up to the top?

36:19.899 --> 36:21.599
Come on.
Come on...

36:26.539 --> 36:28.206
If you look
over there,

36:28.307 --> 36:29.541
you can see
all the way

36:29.642 --> 36:30.808
to Wisconsin.

36:30.910 --> 36:32.111
Oh, wow.

36:34.214 --> 36:35.647
Have you ever been
to Wisconsin?

36:35.748 --> 36:36.714
No.

36:39.152 --> 36:40.653
It's incredible,

36:40.754 --> 36:43.389
the pine trees
and the fresh air, and...

36:43.490 --> 36:45.892
You go outside at night there,
and you look up at the stars,

36:45.993 --> 36:47.226
and you can't even believe

36:47.327 --> 36:49.930
there are that many stars
in the universe.

36:50.031 --> 36:52.299
It's my favorite place
in the world.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.034
Sounds beautiful.

36:55.169 --> 36:58.206
I have a little cabin
in lake Geneva

36:58.307 --> 36:59.206
that my parents left me.

36:59.307 --> 37:01.809
Oh, wow!

37:01.910 --> 37:04.812
We could go up
for the weekend.

37:04.913 --> 37:07.281
Oh... I don't know.

37:09.519 --> 37:11.385
It has
two bedrooms.

37:11.486 --> 37:12.820
Oh!

37:12.921 --> 37:14.389
Um...

37:14.490 --> 37:16.992
No, I just, uh...

37:17.093 --> 37:19.561
I just have to work
this weekend.

37:20.598 --> 37:22.265
Sorry.

37:22.366 --> 37:23.398
It's okay.
It's not your fault.

37:23.499 --> 37:24.399
We'll just...

37:24.500 --> 37:26.402
We'll do it
another time.

37:26.503 --> 37:27.904
I'd like that.

37:32.310 --> 37:34.111
How about
next weekend?

37:34.212 --> 37:35.278
Oh...

37:35.379 --> 37:38.148
Next weekend, um...

37:38.250 --> 37:40.918
I've got to work on
this deal that's closing.

37:42.387 --> 37:44.322
And the weekend
after that?

37:46.259 --> 37:47.291
Yeah...

37:48.360 --> 37:50.228
Okay, now I'm starting
to get the feeling

37:50.329 --> 37:52.297
that there's something
you're not telling me.

37:52.398 --> 37:53.798
What do you mean?

37:55.368 --> 37:56.736
Debbie,
if you're not into me...

37:56.837 --> 37:57.937
It's... it's okay.

37:58.038 --> 38:00.171
Oh, no, no,
that's not it.

38:01.507 --> 38:02.675
Because if you don't
want to see me,

38:02.776 --> 38:05.678
I mean, you could just...
Go ahead and say so.

38:05.779 --> 38:06.946
I...

38:07.047 --> 38:07.948
I can handle it.

38:08.049 --> 38:09.916
I want to see you.

38:11.451 --> 38:13.452
I want to go to
the cabin with you.

38:13.554 --> 38:15.389
Good...

38:15.490 --> 38:16.657
Because I lied.

38:17.759 --> 38:18.825
I wouldn't have been able
to handle it.

38:23.298 --> 38:24.564
Good.

38:26.235 --> 38:27.435
I like you, Debbie.

38:27.536 --> 38:28.503
I just don't want
you to think

38:28.604 --> 38:32.174
that I go around inviting women
up to the cabin.

38:33.543 --> 38:35.376
You're the only one.

38:58.636 --> 39:01.839
I'm sorry, I'm having, like,
an allergic reaction.

39:03.442 --> 39:05.509
Oh-ho, that...
That is a first.

39:05.610 --> 39:06.744
I've never had
that effect on a woman.

39:06.845 --> 39:08.847
No...

39:08.948 --> 39:10.248
No, it's...

39:10.349 --> 39:11.716
I don't know,
the chicken, or...

39:11.817 --> 39:14.186
The hot sauce.

39:14.287 --> 39:15.687
I'm not good
with spices.

39:15.788 --> 39:16.955
I think...

39:17.056 --> 39:18.223
Cinnamon is about
as far as I go,

39:18.324 --> 39:20.526
and so... even that's
pretty adventurous.

39:20.627 --> 39:21.527
This is...
It's... yeah.

39:21.628 --> 39:22.661
It's the hot sauce.

39:22.762 --> 39:24.129
I think you've just got
to build up your tolerance.

39:24.230 --> 39:25.130
You know, fight fire
with fire.

39:25.231 --> 39:26.566
Any more fire
in here,

39:26.667 --> 39:28.034
and we'll have
to call 911.

39:28.135 --> 39:29.268
Let me look at it.

39:29.370 --> 39:30.503
It's... look.

39:30.604 --> 39:31.472
Yeah, yeah,
don't touch it.

39:31.573 --> 39:32.940
You have a rash,

39:33.041 --> 39:34.273
but it's going
to clear up

39:34.375 --> 39:35.808
if you drink
plenty of water

39:35.909 --> 39:37.711
and 50 milligrams
of Benadryl

39:37.812 --> 39:39.213
every four hours.

39:39.280 --> 39:40.180
Okay!

39:40.281 --> 39:41.181
- You hear me?
- Yes.

39:41.282 --> 39:43.250
50 milligrams.
No more, no less.

39:43.351 --> 39:44.252
You are bossy.

39:44.353 --> 39:45.954
I am bossy!

39:46.055 --> 39:47.554
Yeah, it's true

39:47.655 --> 39:48.789
what they say
about doctors.

39:48.890 --> 39:50.158
You have
a God complex, huh?

39:52.495 --> 39:53.395
Wait, what?

39:53.496 --> 39:54.596
That was a joke.
I'm sorry.

39:54.697 --> 39:56.766
I'm sure
you're very humble.

39:57.868 --> 39:59.367
I've been meaning
to ask you.

39:59.468 --> 40:01.637
What made you want
to become an obstetrician?

40:04.341 --> 40:06.275
Wait a minute,
I never told you that.

40:06.376 --> 40:09.312
I saw "doctor" on your profile,
and I googled you.

40:11.548 --> 40:12.415
On my profile?

40:12.516 --> 40:15.652
Yeah, and I read
that article

40:15.753 --> 40:17.521
about you delivered
quintuplets last year.

40:17.622 --> 40:19.022
That was amazing.

40:19.123 --> 40:20.425
Reggie...

40:20.526 --> 40:21.426
No, that wasn't...

40:21.527 --> 40:22.426
That was
incredible!

40:22.527 --> 40:24.795
That was...
A medical miracle.

40:24.896 --> 40:26.063
You saved their lives.

40:26.165 --> 40:27.899
No, I don't think
you understand...

40:29.902 --> 40:31.269
That was...

40:39.179 --> 40:43.015
It took a whole team of highly
qualified medical personnel

40:43.116 --> 40:45.785
and nurses who never get
the credit they deserve.

40:48.688 --> 40:51.090
See? You are humble.

42:04.371 --> 42:05.371
Oh, you...

42:05.472 --> 42:08.475
- Hey!
- I should kill you!

42:08.576 --> 42:09.543
This is a hospital.

42:09.644 --> 42:10.709
We save lives here.
We don't wipe them out.

42:10.810 --> 42:13.380
You switched my profile
to tell her I was a doctor!

42:13.481 --> 42:14.648
And this is the way
you thank me?

42:14.749 --> 42:16.316
Thank you?

42:16.417 --> 42:17.817
Yeah, you've got women
coming out of the woodwork.

42:17.919 --> 42:19.019
The way I see it,
you owe me one.

42:19.120 --> 42:21.756
Yeah, but she thinks
I'm that Dr. j. Thomas Cooper.

42:21.857 --> 42:23.323
I had nothing
to do with that.

42:23.424 --> 42:24.858
It's because
of your lie.

42:24.959 --> 42:26.961
Okay, then what did she say
when you set her straight?

42:27.062 --> 42:27.929
I...

42:28.030 --> 42:28.930
I...

42:29.031 --> 42:30.064
Didn't exactly.

42:30.165 --> 42:32.034
Now who's the pot
calling the kettle black?

42:32.135 --> 42:33.869
It is...
I was backed into a corner.

42:33.970 --> 42:34.902
Well, that's when we show
our truest character,

42:34.970 --> 42:36.270
when our backs
are up against the wall,

42:36.371 --> 42:37.239
and we're desperate.

42:37.340 --> 42:39.575
Right,
but it's not my character.

42:39.676 --> 42:41.009
Don't worry,
there are other fish in the sea.

42:41.110 --> 42:42.844
I like this fish.

43:11.109 --> 43:12.476
If it isn't nurse ratched.

43:12.577 --> 43:14.446
Rise and shine.

43:18.117 --> 43:19.518
Hey...

43:19.620 --> 43:20.953
Hey, what did you do
with my game?

43:21.054 --> 43:22.253
Me?

43:22.355 --> 43:23.355
Nothing.

43:23.456 --> 43:25.023
No, no, no,
it was right here.

43:26.159 --> 43:27.326
Night nurse.
Should check with her.

43:27.427 --> 43:29.261
I'm going to report you
for theft.

43:29.363 --> 43:30.563
You can get fired for this.

43:31.666 --> 43:33.100
Get a grip, buddy.

43:33.201 --> 43:34.800
I didn't take
your stupid game.

43:38.206 --> 43:40.841
So what am I supposed
to do now, huh?

43:40.942 --> 43:42.509
Watch reruns
of the price is right?

43:42.610 --> 43:43.945
I could loan you a book
I'm reading.

43:44.046 --> 43:47.280
It's "the catcher in the rye."

43:47.382 --> 43:48.382
Yeah, great.

43:49.752 --> 43:50.718
I probably shouldn't,
though.

43:51.854 --> 43:53.588
Your parents would kill me.

43:53.689 --> 43:56.325
It's filled
with teenaged rebellion

43:56.426 --> 43:57.326
and profanity...

43:57.427 --> 43:59.227
Used to be banned
in some high schools.

43:59.328 --> 44:01.463
Saved my life
when I was your age.

44:04.134 --> 44:06.001
Don't tell anyone
I gave you that.

44:19.484 --> 44:21.686
I can't take
deceiving her anymore.

44:21.787 --> 44:23.820
This weekend, I'm going
to tell her who I am.

44:23.888 --> 44:25.823
And you think that
a roaring fireplace

44:25.924 --> 44:27.324
is going to take
the sting out of it?

44:27.426 --> 44:29.627
No, but I think that it's
going to help her know

44:29.728 --> 44:30.828
how much I care about her.

44:30.929 --> 44:31.997
That's a great idea.

44:33.232 --> 44:34.098
Okay...

44:34.199 --> 44:35.566
So...

44:35.667 --> 44:37.536
You all ready?

44:37.637 --> 44:39.538
I've left you
some instructions.

44:39.639 --> 44:40.539
Okay...

44:40.640 --> 44:42.007
Do not forget to get
my line notes scanned

44:42.108 --> 44:43.643
and to Leon mansard
by 5:00 P.M...

44:44.845 --> 44:46.478
The loan documents need
to get to first national...

44:46.579 --> 44:48.246
And then we need

44:48.347 --> 44:49.482
to reschedule
the conference call for...

44:49.583 --> 44:50.750
Yup. Thank you.

44:51.785 --> 44:52.785
Yup.

44:52.886 --> 44:54.120
I can't go.

44:54.221 --> 44:55.122
I have too much going on.

44:55.223 --> 44:56.256
I can't, I can't...

44:56.357 --> 44:57.291
He's going
to have to understand.

44:57.392 --> 44:59.225
Everything
will be fine here.

44:59.326 --> 45:00.226
Trust me.

45:00.327 --> 45:03.464
Maybe it's time
you listen to your heart,

45:03.565 --> 45:08.169
and not that big dumb brain
of yours.

45:08.270 --> 45:09.870
In that case,

45:09.971 --> 45:13.174
I'm telling him the truth
this weekend,

45:13.275 --> 45:15.009
if it's the last thing I do.

45:16.445 --> 45:17.846
Okay... yup.

45:20.884 --> 45:22.083
- Debbie!
- Hi!

45:22.184 --> 45:23.785
Yeah.
Right over here.

45:23.886 --> 45:24.819
- Hi!
- Hi.

45:24.920 --> 45:26.922
- Good to see you!
- Good to see you.

45:28.992 --> 45:29.859
I had
an umbrella somewhere.

45:29.960 --> 45:30.993
Okay!

45:37.502 --> 45:38.368
That's roxy.

45:38.469 --> 45:40.804
Hi, roxy!
My goodness!

45:48.346 --> 45:51.249
Hi, Samuels.
It's Charles.

45:59.691 --> 46:01.493
What do you think?

46:03.630 --> 46:05.664
It's... amazing.
It's perfect.

46:12.640 --> 46:14.574
Wow...

46:14.676 --> 46:17.010
Oh, my gosh...

46:17.111 --> 46:18.980
We're here

46:19.081 --> 46:21.748
oh, my goodness...

46:21.849 --> 46:23.850
Jack, this place is great.

46:26.855 --> 46:28.222
Debbie, there's...

46:28.324 --> 46:29.824
There's something
I have to get off my chest.

46:29.925 --> 46:31.727
Okay.

46:31.828 --> 46:32.828
What is it?

46:32.929 --> 46:34.629
The truth...

46:34.730 --> 46:36.431
Is I'm actually...

46:37.901 --> 46:40.169
I'm not really...

46:42.305 --> 46:43.606
Okay, I'm not really good

46:43.708 --> 46:48.410
at expressing my feelings
with my words.

46:48.512 --> 46:52.248
I get tongue-tied
when I'm around you.

46:53.551 --> 46:54.985
So I got you this.

46:56.588 --> 46:58.288
Oh, Jack...

47:01.226 --> 47:02.626
It's not a big deal,
really.

47:02.728 --> 47:03.928
It's just a...

47:05.197 --> 47:06.665
A heart!

47:06.766 --> 47:09.067
I know
it's corny, but...

47:09.168 --> 47:11.669
No!

47:11.770 --> 47:13.205
No one's ever gotten me
a heart before.

47:14.974 --> 47:17.042
It's engraved
on the back.

47:18.645 --> 47:19.979
"Always, Jake."

47:21.948 --> 47:23.582
What? What does it...
Does it say that?

47:23.683 --> 47:24.584
Yeah!

47:24.685 --> 47:26.519
- No!
- Yeah!

47:26.620 --> 47:27.954
No! Oh, they
messed it up!

47:28.055 --> 47:29.255
Yeah!

47:29.356 --> 47:30.223
Okay, I'm taking
it back.

47:30.324 --> 47:31.325
No, no!
Please, no.

47:31.426 --> 47:32.760
- Give it to me.
- No, I like it.

47:32.861 --> 47:35.161
Please don't take it back.

47:35.262 --> 47:36.362
You're not supposed
to be laughing!

47:36.464 --> 47:37.364
Give it to me.

47:37.465 --> 47:39.333
- It's funny! It's funny.
- Give me that.

47:39.434 --> 47:40.601
No. No, no, no!

47:40.702 --> 47:41.668
Give it... whoa!
Oh, wait.

47:50.880 --> 47:51.746
Ooh...

47:51.847 --> 47:52.914
Here's hot cocoa.

47:53.015 --> 47:54.884
Thank you.

47:59.321 --> 48:00.221
Jack...

48:00.322 --> 48:01.424
There's something
you need to know about me.

48:03.960 --> 48:05.127
Okay.

48:05.228 --> 48:06.763
What is it?

48:08.299 --> 48:09.932
Okay, I...

48:16.407 --> 48:18.810
I can't cook at all.

48:18.911 --> 48:20.678
I mean...

48:20.779 --> 48:21.845
Not even popcorn.

48:23.315 --> 48:24.849
Okay.

48:24.951 --> 48:26.284
We can survive on
peanut butter sandwiches

48:26.385 --> 48:27.719
if we have to.

48:30.657 --> 48:32.091
Is there anything else?

48:36.797 --> 48:37.997
I'm...

48:39.166 --> 48:41.100
I'm not...

48:42.737 --> 48:43.603
I'm not...

48:43.705 --> 48:45.438
Okay,
no, no, no, stop.

48:45.539 --> 48:48.442
I don't care
what you're not.

48:49.877 --> 48:51.645
I care what you are...

48:53.614 --> 48:55.516
And you are

48:55.617 --> 48:58.318
what every guy
would dream of.

48:58.419 --> 48:59.988
You're beautiful,

49:00.089 --> 49:02.056
and smart,

49:02.157 --> 49:04.192
and fun.

49:04.293 --> 49:05.928
I'm fun?

49:07.230 --> 49:10.031
But those are just
the obvious things.

49:10.132 --> 49:12.935
What I'm talking about

49:13.036 --> 49:15.938
is all the
undefinable things,

49:16.039 --> 49:17.206
all the little things

49:17.307 --> 49:20.176
that come together
to make up who you are.

49:22.579 --> 49:23.712
Your essence.

49:24.882 --> 49:27.384
Your soul.

49:27.485 --> 49:28.985
Your gist.

49:49.509 --> 49:50.942
My gist?

49:57.283 --> 49:59.017
I'm just saying,

49:59.118 --> 50:00.820
this can't go on.

50:02.322 --> 50:04.424
I'm going to tell her
during breakfast.

50:06.795 --> 50:07.895
You agree with me, right, girl?

50:30.187 --> 50:31.387
You've got to tell him.

50:34.490 --> 50:35.657
Right now.

50:44.701 --> 50:47.136
Good morning,
sleepy head.

50:47.237 --> 50:48.205
I was getting scared
roxy and I

50:48.306 --> 50:49.806
were going to have
to eat this all ourselves.

50:51.075 --> 50:53.610
Jack, I...

50:53.712 --> 50:54.612
Wow.

50:54.713 --> 50:55.780
I don't deserve all this.

50:55.881 --> 50:56.746
No, I was
just thinking

50:56.848 --> 50:58.148
you...
You deserve better.

50:58.249 --> 50:59.116
No, Jack...

50:59.217 --> 51:01.853
Listen...

51:01.920 --> 51:02.887
Should probably
get that.

51:04.022 --> 51:05.022
It's been ringing all morning.

51:06.626 --> 51:07.626
'Kay.

51:11.965 --> 51:13.632
It's my boss.

51:13.733 --> 51:14.600
Got to take it.

51:14.701 --> 51:15.868
Okay.

51:15.969 --> 51:17.236
Hi.

51:17.337 --> 51:18.238
What's wrong?

51:18.339 --> 51:19.639
<i>Don't panic.</i>

51:19.740 --> 51:20.739
The edinger deal.

51:20.840 --> 51:22.274
I knew something was falling
through the cracks.

51:22.375 --> 51:23.642
It's your father.

51:23.744 --> 51:25.545
He's had a heart attack.

51:25.646 --> 51:26.713
What?

51:26.814 --> 51:28.948
<i>He's all right.</i>
<i>It was very minor,</i>

51:29.049 --> 51:30.651
<i>but they just want</i>
<i>to keep him in for a few days</i>

51:30.752 --> 51:32.552
<i>for observations and tests.</i>

51:32.653 --> 51:34.320
What hospital?

51:34.421 --> 51:35.421
<i>Chicago west.</i>

51:37.492 --> 51:39.393
That's Jack's hospital.

51:40.996 --> 51:42.797
Okay, I'm on my way.

51:42.899 --> 51:43.798
Thanks.

51:46.401 --> 51:47.736
I'm so sorry.
I have to go.

51:47.837 --> 51:49.070
My dad's in the hospital.

51:49.172 --> 51:50.305
What happened?

51:50.406 --> 51:51.439
He had a heart attack.

51:52.675 --> 51:53.575
Where? What hospital?

51:53.677 --> 51:55.011
Um...

51:55.112 --> 51:56.912
University of Chicago.

51:58.548 --> 51:59.548
Okay, I'll get ready.

51:59.650 --> 52:01.784
Okay. Thank you.

52:03.355 --> 52:04.656
You didn't tell him yet?

52:04.724 --> 52:05.757
I didn't have
the opportunity.

52:05.858 --> 52:07.058
Well, what happens

52:07.159 --> 52:08.659
when he wants
to look in at your dad

52:08.760 --> 52:10.195
and there's no
"Mr. celvin" checked in?

52:10.296 --> 52:11.263
I lied again.

52:11.364 --> 52:12.898
I told him
we were at a different hospital.

52:12.999 --> 52:14.466
And if he sees
you here visiting?

52:14.567 --> 52:15.467
He is in
labor and delivery.

52:15.568 --> 52:16.869
That's a different wing.

52:16.970 --> 52:17.870
He has no reason
to be over here.

52:17.971 --> 52:19.371
I'm looking for my father,
Edward Benson.

52:19.472 --> 52:20.872
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Slow down, honey.

52:20.973 --> 52:22.341
Edward Benson,
please?

52:22.443 --> 52:24.377
He's in room 505.

52:28.316 --> 52:29.850
Oh, daddy.

52:29.951 --> 52:31.751
I'm fine, kitten.
Really, I am.

52:31.852 --> 52:32.752
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

52:32.853 --> 52:35.089
I'm sorry
I wasn't here for you.

52:36.991 --> 52:38.125
Katherine!

52:38.226 --> 52:39.093
We've been frantic
looking for you.

52:39.194 --> 52:41.463
- Where have you been?
- I was...

52:41.564 --> 52:42.530
Out of town.

52:42.631 --> 52:44.998
That's unlike you
to go off without telling us.

52:45.100 --> 52:46.634
Well, enough about me.

52:46.736 --> 52:47.669
What do the doctors say?

52:47.770 --> 52:50.004
They think
it's very minor.

52:50.106 --> 52:51.306
They just want
to keep an eye on him.

52:51.407 --> 52:52.942
I thought it was indigestion.

52:53.043 --> 52:54.710
He's as fit as a fiddle.

52:54.810 --> 52:56.678
He had a heart attack, Charles!

52:56.779 --> 52:57.746
He could have died!

52:59.249 --> 53:00.216
I'm sorry, folks.

53:00.317 --> 53:01.517
The doctor ordered another ecg

53:01.618 --> 53:03.719
to check
Mr. Benson's heart function.

53:03.820 --> 53:06.256
Okay, I'll be here
when you get out, okay?

53:06.357 --> 53:07.556
I love you.
You know that?

53:07.657 --> 53:10.160
I know that, kitten.
I love you, too.

53:11.295 --> 53:12.262
Okay.

53:19.937 --> 53:21.271
I'm sorry, Charles.

53:21.372 --> 53:23.274
You've got to understand...
He's all I have.

53:24.476 --> 53:26.944
You've got me, too.

53:28.381 --> 53:30.082
I need to be alone right now.

53:41.862 --> 53:43.428
Greetings
from the dairy state.

53:43.530 --> 53:45.497
Aw, what a doll.

53:45.598 --> 53:46.499
What do you got for me?

53:46.600 --> 53:48.334
New guy in 505.

53:48.435 --> 53:50.670
Been here a day
and thinks he owns the place.

53:50.771 --> 53:53.174
I will whip him into shape.

53:53.275 --> 53:54.341
I'm sure you will.

53:55.342 --> 53:57.143
Ooh, that's nice. Sweet.

53:57.244 --> 53:58.546
We can't break ground

53:58.647 --> 54:00.247
until we get a clean bill
of health from the epa,

54:00.348 --> 54:01.682
not to mention...

54:01.783 --> 54:03.484
Hang on a sec.

54:05.288 --> 54:07.254
No! No, leveraging this deal

54:07.355 --> 54:08.923
will give us
the best capital returns

54:09.024 --> 54:10.025
in the long run.

54:10.126 --> 54:10.992
Wha...

54:11.093 --> 54:12.060
Absolutely not.

54:12.161 --> 54:14.462
We can't risk
that skunk pulling out again.

54:14.564 --> 54:15.463
Mr. Benson...

54:15.565 --> 54:17.834
You'll have to speak up.
I can't hear you.

54:17.935 --> 54:19.367
Jim, no...

54:20.369 --> 54:22.738
I need a good faith offer
of at least 50 million

54:22.840 --> 54:23.739
before I'll even consider
sitting down with him.

54:23.807 --> 54:25.741
Thank you.
Bye, Jim.

54:25.843 --> 54:26.843
What did you do that for?

54:26.944 --> 54:28.245
Okay.

54:28.346 --> 54:29.713
Take a breath.

54:31.315 --> 54:32.782
First, you unplugged
your heart monitor,

54:32.850 --> 54:33.916
and second,
you're supposed to be in bed,

54:34.018 --> 54:35.385
getting rest.

54:35.486 --> 54:37.120
Doctor's orders.

54:37.222 --> 54:38.856
You're not my doctor.

54:38.957 --> 54:39.958
Nope.

54:41.460 --> 54:42.893
I'm your nurse.

54:45.864 --> 54:47.765
It's a practical joke, right?

54:47.833 --> 54:49.534
Frank holzman
put you up to this?

54:49.635 --> 54:52.238
It's one of
those song-o-grams, right?

54:58.645 --> 55:00.579
Okay, so when you
get back to the office,

55:00.680 --> 55:01.547
get a copy to each party,

55:01.648 --> 55:03.048
including a
revised addendum.

55:03.149 --> 55:04.017
Will do.

55:04.118 --> 55:05.952
- Anything else?
- Mm-hmm.

55:06.053 --> 55:08.354
Charles left this
for your father.

55:08.455 --> 55:11.524
Some new hotel development
he wants him to take a look at.

55:11.626 --> 55:14.160
You'd think he could
give the guy a day or two.

55:14.262 --> 55:15.997
Want me
to give it back to him?

55:16.098 --> 55:17.164
No, I'll look at it.

55:18.267 --> 55:19.366
Oh, no! The doctor's in!
The doctor's in!

55:19.467 --> 55:22.737
- Don't look, don't look.
- Okay, I won't. I'm not looking.

55:22.838 --> 55:24.038
Kate!

55:24.139 --> 55:25.273
Debbie, what are you doing here?

55:27.676 --> 55:29.945
Um, Katherine...

55:30.046 --> 55:32.647
Katherine was not...
Katherine, um...

55:33.649 --> 55:35.050
- I fainted.
- Right? Yeah.

55:35.151 --> 55:36.318
Must be exhaustion.

55:36.419 --> 55:38.420
I work like a maniac,
in case you haven't heard.

55:38.521 --> 55:41.724
I really ought
to take this as a warning.

55:41.859 --> 55:43.725
Was there any vomiting
or abdominal cramps?

55:43.826 --> 55:45.560
- No.
- Yes.

55:45.662 --> 55:46.529
Yeah, no...?

55:46.630 --> 55:47.530
No.

55:47.631 --> 55:49.232
There was,
but that's past.

55:49.333 --> 55:50.233
That's all gone now.

55:50.334 --> 55:51.301
It is.
All gone.

55:51.402 --> 55:53.737
Feeling
much better.

55:53.838 --> 55:56.139
I will be taking
a few days off, though.

55:56.240 --> 55:58.375
Sounds like you're dehydrated.

56:01.146 --> 56:02.379
Hi, um...

56:02.480 --> 56:04.482
My name is Reggie leduca.

56:04.583 --> 56:06.984
My friends call me Reggie...

56:07.085 --> 56:08.319
Leduca...

56:11.691 --> 56:13.558
Has anyone ever told you

56:13.659 --> 56:15.093
that you have
the most amazing eyes?

56:18.831 --> 56:20.999
Um...

56:21.133 --> 56:22.134
Katherine,
did you say

56:22.235 --> 56:23.836
you had to get back
to the office?

56:25.872 --> 56:26.872
Katherine!

56:26.974 --> 56:27.941
Reggie...

56:28.042 --> 56:29.343
- Oh.
- Huh?

56:29.444 --> 56:31.711
Yes. Yeah. I...

56:32.980 --> 56:34.748
Have a job,

56:34.849 --> 56:36.249
and I have to go there.

56:37.251 --> 56:40.254
Can I walk you back to work,
Katherine?

56:49.031 --> 56:50.231
You okay?

56:52.302 --> 56:53.168
Phew.

56:55.137 --> 56:56.204
Hi.

56:56.305 --> 56:57.572
Hi.

56:59.576 --> 57:01.143
Um... how's your dad?

57:01.244 --> 57:04.647
He's fine, thank you.

57:04.749 --> 57:06.582
He should be discharged
before the weekend.

57:06.683 --> 57:08.150
Good, good.

57:08.251 --> 57:09.151
Yeah.

57:09.252 --> 57:10.220
I've missed you.

57:12.556 --> 57:15.592
It's only been
45 hours.

57:15.659 --> 57:16.961
Okay...

57:17.062 --> 57:19.496
Good, so you're
counting, too.

57:19.597 --> 57:20.897
I guess I am.

57:23.635 --> 57:25.202
You look very cute
in your scrubs.

57:25.303 --> 57:26.804
Thank you.

57:26.905 --> 57:28.573
You look very cute
in your gray dress.

57:30.575 --> 57:31.542
Thank you.

57:32.778 --> 57:34.613
When do I get to see you again?

57:34.714 --> 57:36.581
This Friday work?

57:36.682 --> 57:37.949
I'll call.

57:38.051 --> 57:39.618
I'll answer.

57:51.866 --> 57:53.233
You look better.

57:53.334 --> 57:55.334
Kitten, I'm perfectly fine.

57:55.436 --> 57:57.203
I don't even know
why I have to stay here.

57:58.339 --> 57:59.840
It's for
your own good.

57:59.941 --> 58:01.942
Please don't talk to me
like I'm a child.

58:02.043 --> 58:03.778
Hey, did you see
what I brought you?

58:03.846 --> 58:04.779
A chess set.

58:04.880 --> 58:06.480
Mm-hmm.

58:06.581 --> 58:07.815
Payback.

58:07.916 --> 58:09.818
For all those times
you trounced me as a kid.

58:09.919 --> 58:11.186
It's the only way you'd learn.

58:11.287 --> 58:13.421
I thought
you were just a poor loser.

58:13.522 --> 58:14.856
That too.

58:19.929 --> 58:20.895
Daddy?

58:20.996 --> 58:22.565
Mm-hmm?

58:24.468 --> 58:26.669
How long did it take you
to fall in love with mom?

58:28.306 --> 58:30.173
Ooh...

58:30.274 --> 58:32.808
I'd say about
a minute and a half.

58:34.145 --> 58:36.113
Really?

58:36.214 --> 58:37.948
That fast.

58:38.049 --> 58:40.051
She had that laugh.

58:40.152 --> 58:41.352
Remember?

58:41.453 --> 58:43.854
How she could shake you
out of your bluest moment

58:43.955 --> 58:46.290
and make you feel like
you could conquer anything.

58:46.391 --> 58:49.026
When I heard that laugh,
I was done for.

58:50.129 --> 58:51.062
Why?

58:51.163 --> 58:54.233
What's troubling
you, kitten?

58:54.334 --> 58:56.968
I think I may be in love.

58:57.069 --> 58:58.871
Oh, Katherine...

59:00.673 --> 59:02.941
It's someone

59:03.042 --> 59:05.311
I can see

59:05.412 --> 59:07.312
spending the rest
of my life with,

59:07.413 --> 59:08.514
having children with.

59:08.615 --> 59:10.517
But what about Charles?

59:10.618 --> 59:11.651
I thought you were
going to try to do...

59:11.752 --> 59:13.419
I did try.

59:13.487 --> 59:14.621
I did,

59:14.722 --> 59:16.423
and I just don't love him.

59:16.525 --> 59:17.458
And you love
this man,

59:17.559 --> 59:19.125
someone you don't
even know?

59:19.226 --> 59:20.693
I know him.

59:20.794 --> 59:21.695
What does he do for a living?

59:21.796 --> 59:23.130
Who are his parents?

59:23.231 --> 59:25.132
What schools
did he go to?

59:25.233 --> 59:26.300
I'm a grown woman.

59:26.401 --> 59:27.903
I don't have to
justify my choices to you.

59:28.004 --> 59:28.937
And I'm your father.

59:29.038 --> 59:30.205
You most certainly do.

59:30.306 --> 59:32.907
You realize
you put me in charge

59:33.008 --> 59:34.809
of a multi-billion dollar
corporation.

59:34.911 --> 59:37.345
And hundreds of decisions
every day

59:37.446 --> 59:38.980
that determine its future,

59:39.081 --> 59:42.151
but you won't let me make
a single one about my own?

59:42.252 --> 59:43.552
Business is one thing,
but love is...

59:43.653 --> 59:46.756
Love is personal.

59:46.823 --> 59:50.159
You and the board of directors
don't get a vote.

59:50.260 --> 59:51.795
Katherine...

59:51.896 --> 59:54.330
Katherine!

01:00:11.317 --> 01:00:13.618
The guy's name's
Jack Cooper.

01:00:13.719 --> 01:00:16.689
It seems like they met
on a dating website.

01:00:17.891 --> 01:00:21.226
He's a registered nurse
at Chicago west.

01:00:21.327 --> 01:00:24.363
All his personal
info is in there.

01:00:33.709 --> 01:00:34.809
Mr. Benson!

01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:40.349
I was coming back
from the bathroom,

01:00:40.450 --> 01:00:42.350
and my legs just
gave out on me.

01:00:42.451 --> 01:00:43.851
You know you're
not supposed to

01:00:43.952 --> 01:00:45.354
get out of bed
by yourself.

01:00:45.455 --> 01:00:47.022
I've been going to
the bathroom on my own

01:00:47.123 --> 01:00:48.090
since I was
three years old.

01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:49.925
I'm not ready to
change things yet.

01:00:50.026 --> 01:00:50.927
Okay, from now on,

01:00:51.028 --> 01:00:53.129
you have to ring me
if you need to get up.

01:00:56.065 --> 01:00:58.134
Mr. Benson, I can have
a female nurse assigned

01:00:58.235 --> 01:01:00.169
if it makes you feel
more comfortable.

01:01:02.006 --> 01:01:04.074
Nah, it's okay.

01:01:04.175 --> 01:01:08.444
Sometimes, I need to sit
with an idea for a while, but...

01:01:08.546 --> 01:01:10.080
I usually come around.

01:01:12.651 --> 01:01:14.686
You play?

01:01:16.956 --> 01:01:21.293
State high school champ
'64 through '67.

01:01:23.729 --> 01:01:25.730
50 years ago.

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:39.313
We gonna be here
all day or what?

01:01:39.414 --> 01:01:41.380
You got somewhere
you need to be?

01:01:43.317 --> 01:01:45.319
Hmm...

01:01:50.659 --> 01:01:52.493
You know, my late wife
was a nurse.

01:01:52.594 --> 01:01:53.894
We met during the war.

01:01:53.995 --> 01:01:54.895
Civil?

01:01:56.097 --> 01:01:58.533
Vietnam, smart-aleck.

01:01:58.634 --> 01:02:00.268
And you... you got
a girlfriend?

01:02:00.369 --> 01:02:01.803
I do.

01:02:01.904 --> 01:02:03.505
How'd you two meet?

01:02:03.606 --> 01:02:06.274
On the Internet.

01:02:06.375 --> 01:02:07.675
Ah, one of those
desperate cases, hmm?

01:02:07.776 --> 01:02:09.611
Lots of people
meet that way.

01:02:09.713 --> 01:02:12.548
You kids nowadays want
everything to be so easy.

01:02:12.649 --> 01:02:13.549
You think
you can find love

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:14.617
by filling out
a survey,

01:02:14.719 --> 01:02:15.618
checking off a list,

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.252
like you were
buying a car.

01:02:17.354 --> 01:02:18.487
"Mercedes."

01:02:18.588 --> 01:02:20.055
Click.

01:02:20.156 --> 01:02:21.157
"Power steering."
Click.

01:02:21.258 --> 01:02:22.625
"Black." Click.

01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:24.327
"Extra cup holder."

01:02:24.428 --> 01:02:26.831
Sometimes, you got to
dig to find the gold.

01:02:26.932 --> 01:02:27.798
Love,

01:02:27.899 --> 01:02:29.199
like anything worth having,

01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.234
requires some good
old-fashioned elbow grease.

01:02:33.572 --> 01:02:35.406
That's what I've been telling
my hotheaded daughter anyway.

01:02:35.507 --> 01:02:36.374
You have a daughter?

01:02:36.475 --> 01:02:37.408
Mm-hmm.

01:02:37.509 --> 01:02:40.078
And she's taken,
so don't get any big ideas.

01:02:40.179 --> 01:02:41.178
Are you kidding?

01:02:41.279 --> 01:02:42.246
The last thing
I would want

01:02:42.347 --> 01:02:43.681
is you
as a father-in-law.

01:02:43.782 --> 01:02:45.650
My sentiments exactly.

01:02:45.752 --> 01:02:46.718
Exactly.

01:02:51.959 --> 01:02:54.659
So, this Internet
girlfriend of yours,

01:02:54.761 --> 01:02:56.328
she doesn't mind
your chosen profession?

01:02:56.430 --> 01:02:57.797
No...

01:02:57.898 --> 01:03:00.500
Not in the least.

01:03:02.102 --> 01:03:03.670
She doesn't exist, does she?

01:03:03.772 --> 01:03:06.239
She exists.

01:03:06.340 --> 01:03:08.776
But she thinks I'm a doctor.

01:03:08.877 --> 01:03:10.344
Ooh... that's quite
the kettle of fish,

01:03:10.445 --> 01:03:11.345
now, isn't it?

01:03:11.446 --> 01:03:13.247
I didn't mean for it to happen.

01:03:13.348 --> 01:03:16.484
Things just got away from me,

01:03:16.585 --> 01:03:19.019
and I...

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.488
Do you love her?

01:03:23.325 --> 01:03:24.959
I do.

01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:27.563
Then you've got
to tell her.

01:03:29.165 --> 01:03:30.465
I know.

01:03:38.208 --> 01:03:39.242
<i>Hi, it's me.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

01:03:39.343 --> 01:03:40.610
<i>I'll call you back.</i>

01:03:40.711 --> 01:03:43.546
Hi, Debbie, it's, uh, it's me.

01:03:43.647 --> 01:03:46.450
I have something
really important

01:03:46.551 --> 01:03:47.717
that I have to tell you,

01:03:47.819 --> 01:03:49.686
and it can't wait till Friday.

01:03:50.889 --> 01:03:53.490
Can I see you tomorrow?

01:04:16.283 --> 01:04:19.017
Jack Cooper?

01:04:19.118 --> 01:04:21.588
How can I help you?

01:04:21.689 --> 01:04:23.122
I'm Charles Hodges.

01:04:23.224 --> 01:04:24.390
I'm a friend
of Katherine.

01:04:25.559 --> 01:04:26.594
Who's Katherine?

01:04:26.695 --> 01:04:27.795
Katherine Benson,

01:04:27.896 --> 01:04:30.997
president of Benson alliance,
incorporated?

01:04:32.132 --> 01:04:33.167
No.

01:04:33.235 --> 01:04:35.970
No, that's my girlfriend,
that's Debbie celvin.

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:41.208
I don't get it.

01:04:41.309 --> 01:04:43.544
I don't get it, she told me
she was an executive assistant.

01:04:43.645 --> 01:04:45.780
Executive assistant?

01:04:47.783 --> 01:04:49.684
She most certainly is not,

01:04:49.785 --> 01:04:51.487
and from what I understand,
you are not a doctor.

01:04:51.588 --> 01:04:54.756
Don't worry,
I haven't told her yet.

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:57.493
She'd be mortified to realize
she's been duped like this.

01:04:57.594 --> 01:05:01.797
I'd like to spare her
the embarrassment.

01:05:01.899 --> 01:05:04.668
What is this?
A check for $237.00 to at&t?

01:05:04.769 --> 01:05:06.869
No. What?

01:05:06.970 --> 01:05:08.472
Oh, sorry,
that's my phone bill.

01:05:08.573 --> 01:05:09.640
Um...

01:05:10.608 --> 01:05:11.775
Here we go.

01:05:12.911 --> 01:05:15.680
Payable to you.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:17.180
What's this for?

01:05:17.282 --> 01:05:20.351
That is to tell her
you don't love her.

01:05:20.452 --> 01:05:21.586
To walk away.

01:05:21.654 --> 01:05:22.620
Permanently.

01:05:22.721 --> 01:05:24.122
You're buying me off?

01:05:25.124 --> 01:05:26.358
Jack...

01:05:26.459 --> 01:05:28.427
She's a corporate giant.

01:05:28.528 --> 01:05:30.061
Do you really think
she'll be interested in a nurse?

01:05:30.162 --> 01:05:32.298
And one that's lied
to her, to boot?

01:05:32.399 --> 01:05:35.367
Like this,
she may be hurt, perhaps,

01:05:35.468 --> 01:05:37.136
think you're
a bit of a cad,

01:05:37.203 --> 01:05:38.705
but at least
she'll never realize

01:05:38.806 --> 01:05:40.674
what a shameful,

01:05:40.775 --> 01:05:41.974
underhanded thing
you've done.

01:05:42.075 --> 01:05:44.009
You will have
saved face for yourself,

01:05:44.110 --> 01:05:47.113
but more so for Katherine.

01:05:47.214 --> 01:05:49.816
If it's not enough,
I can go higher.

01:05:49.917 --> 01:05:51.252
- I don't...
- Please, Jack.

01:05:51.353 --> 01:05:53.019
Everybody has a price.

01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:54.087
You know what, Charles?

01:05:54.188 --> 01:05:55.088
I get the feeling

01:05:55.189 --> 01:05:56.156
you wouldn't be
standing here

01:05:56.258 --> 01:05:57.358
in front of
my cruddy house

01:05:57.459 --> 01:05:58.459
in this low-rent
neighborhood

01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:00.695
offering me an obscene
amount of money

01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:01.929
if you were so sure
she was going to dump me

01:06:02.030 --> 01:06:04.999
when she finds
out who I am.

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.435
No deal.

01:06:07.536 --> 01:06:08.604
But...

01:06:08.705 --> 01:06:11.306
You will regret this.

01:06:11.407 --> 01:06:13.609
I'll take my chances.

01:06:15.713 --> 01:06:18.180
Come on, girl.
Let's go, rox.

01:06:18.281 --> 01:06:20.048
Come on!

01:06:20.149 --> 01:06:21.584
Leave the bad man.

01:06:31.362 --> 01:06:32.529
She lied to me.

01:06:32.631 --> 01:06:34.064
All this time,

01:06:34.165 --> 01:06:35.065
acting like I was in her league,

01:06:35.166 --> 01:06:36.200
making me think

01:06:36.301 --> 01:06:38.603
that I actually
had a shot with her.

01:06:38.704 --> 01:06:41.005
Why would she do that?

01:06:41.106 --> 01:06:42.873
Well, you lied
to her, too.

01:06:46.045 --> 01:06:47.078
I don't know, man.

01:06:47.146 --> 01:06:50.616
Maybe she wanted to see
how the other half lives.

01:06:50.717 --> 01:06:51.751
So, what?

01:06:51.852 --> 01:06:53.752
I was like some
social experiment?

01:06:53.853 --> 01:06:55.854
Her millions don't
keep her occupied enough?

01:06:55.955 --> 01:06:58.724
What if it's billions?

01:07:00.827 --> 01:07:02.229
I took her bowling!

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:03.797
Of all things,
bowling.

01:07:03.898 --> 01:07:06.732
I man, I am...
I am such a chump.

01:07:06.833 --> 01:07:07.700
No.

01:07:07.801 --> 01:07:10.370
You're a good,
decent guy.

01:07:10.471 --> 01:07:12.339
Anybody who knows you,
knows this.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:14.342
She's lucky to have you.

01:07:14.443 --> 01:07:15.343
Yeah, when
I was a doctor,

01:07:15.444 --> 01:07:17.411
and she was a secretary.

01:07:17.512 --> 01:07:18.545
Hold on, listen,

01:07:18.646 --> 01:07:19.880
if she loves you,

01:07:19.981 --> 01:07:21.449
like, really loves you,

01:07:21.550 --> 01:07:24.886
it's not because
she thought you were a doctor.

01:07:24.987 --> 01:07:29.657
You just said that
women want doctors.

01:07:29.758 --> 01:07:32.261
Yes, no, I did say that,

01:07:32.362 --> 01:07:33.662
but, yeah, you can't
listen to me, man.

01:07:33.763 --> 01:07:34.730
I'm a mess with women.

01:07:34.831 --> 01:07:36.131
Come on!

01:07:36.232 --> 01:07:37.599
Have some confidence, man.

01:07:37.701 --> 01:07:39.536
You'll tell her
all about this,

01:07:39.637 --> 01:07:41.236
you'll both
have a laugh,

01:07:41.304 --> 01:07:44.207
and then, you know,
it'll be...

01:07:44.308 --> 01:07:45.809
It'll be okay.

01:07:45.910 --> 01:07:47.877
I promise.

01:07:48.979 --> 01:07:50.247
In hindsight, though,
the bowling, that was...

01:07:50.348 --> 01:07:51.816
That was...
A bad idea.

01:07:54.754 --> 01:07:56.989
What happened?

01:07:57.991 --> 01:07:59.024
Did something happen?

01:07:59.125 --> 01:08:03.829
I know you're seeing
someone else, Katherine.

01:08:05.799 --> 01:08:06.900
I'm sorry.

01:08:07.001 --> 01:08:08.301
I was going to tell you.

01:08:08.402 --> 01:08:10.937
He's not who
you think he is.

01:08:11.906 --> 01:08:12.807
What?

01:08:12.908 --> 01:08:13.841
Yeah.

01:08:13.942 --> 01:08:15.242
I hired
a private investigator.

01:08:15.343 --> 01:08:18.546
This Jack Cooper,
he's not a doctor.

01:08:18.647 --> 01:08:19.613
Charles, he's
chief of obstetrics.

01:08:19.715 --> 01:08:20.581
At this...

01:08:20.682 --> 01:08:22.283
He's a nurse, Katherine.

01:08:23.452 --> 01:08:25.153
You've got the wrong person.

01:08:25.255 --> 01:08:26.154
He goes by "Jack."

01:08:26.256 --> 01:08:28.389
His name is
Dr. j. Thomas Cooper.

01:08:28.490 --> 01:08:29.924
Dr. j. Thomas...

01:08:30.024 --> 01:08:31.993
Follow me.

01:08:36.332 --> 01:08:37.300
Excuse me, miss,

01:08:37.401 --> 01:08:38.434
would you be so kind

01:08:38.535 --> 01:08:41.069
as to page
Dr. j. Thomas Cooper for us?

01:08:41.170 --> 01:08:43.238
It's a bit of an emergency.

01:08:45.009 --> 01:08:46.341
Dr. j. Thomas Cooper,

01:08:46.443 --> 01:08:48.444
please report
to ccu, stat.

01:08:48.513 --> 01:08:51.015
Dr. Cooper, ccu.

01:08:51.116 --> 01:08:52.081
Thank you.

01:08:52.182 --> 01:08:53.049
What made you think
it would be okay

01:08:53.149 --> 01:08:54.050
to spy on me?

01:08:54.151 --> 01:08:55.819
I did it to protect you.

01:08:57.154 --> 01:08:59.523
That's unbelievable.

01:08:59.624 --> 01:09:01.059
You made a mistake.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.827
You're the one
that's made a mistake.

01:09:05.596 --> 01:09:06.665
Did someone here
have me paged?

01:09:06.765 --> 01:09:08.366
This couple.

01:09:08.466 --> 01:09:10.468
Oh.

01:09:10.536 --> 01:09:12.470
Sorry, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

01:09:12.572 --> 01:09:14.607
We were paging
Dr. j. Thomas Cooper.

01:09:14.707 --> 01:09:15.974
Chief of obstetrics.

01:09:17.810 --> 01:09:19.612
And here I am.

01:09:19.712 --> 01:09:21.647
Katherine!

01:09:21.747 --> 01:09:24.450
I'd like you
to meet someone.

01:09:24.551 --> 01:09:26.219
This is my nurse,
Jack Cooper.

01:09:26.321 --> 01:09:28.220
Plays one mean
game of chess.

01:09:28.322 --> 01:09:30.724
Jack, this is
my daughter, Katherine.

01:09:36.029 --> 01:09:38.099
What's the matter with you two?

01:09:39.233 --> 01:09:41.501
You've been lying to me.

01:09:41.602 --> 01:09:45.106
It seems you were lying
to me, too...

01:09:45.207 --> 01:09:46.274
Katherine?

01:09:49.446 --> 01:09:51.412
What the heck is going on here?

01:09:51.513 --> 01:09:52.380
What's going on

01:09:52.481 --> 01:09:53.814
is that your nurse

01:09:53.916 --> 01:09:55.617
tried to convince Katherine
he's a doctor

01:09:55.719 --> 01:09:56.585
so that she would
go out with him.

01:09:56.686 --> 01:09:58.020
I wasn't the one that...

01:09:58.121 --> 01:09:59.955
Is she the one
you've been talking about?

01:10:00.056 --> 01:10:01.858
He's after your
money, Katherine.

01:10:01.959 --> 01:10:03.192
Her-her money?

01:10:03.293 --> 01:10:04.626
She told me...

01:10:04.728 --> 01:10:06.563
You told me you were
an executive assistant.

01:10:06.664 --> 01:10:07.764
What?

01:10:07.865 --> 01:10:10.734
Dad, please...

01:10:18.643 --> 01:10:22.313
I should have known
this was too good to be true.

01:10:23.715 --> 01:10:25.650
I'm such a fool.

01:10:27.486 --> 01:10:28.586
No...

01:10:28.687 --> 01:10:30.321
You know, uh...

01:10:31.324 --> 01:10:33.992
She made her choice.

01:10:34.093 --> 01:10:36.094
You leave her alone.

01:10:38.332 --> 01:10:40.966
You know this wasn't
about the money, right?

01:10:41.067 --> 01:10:43.336
You know I love her.

01:10:44.471 --> 01:10:46.773
Or is this about
something else?

01:10:46.874 --> 01:10:51.778
You don't think a nurse is
good enough for your daughter.

01:10:51.879 --> 01:10:53.045
Is that it?

01:10:54.281 --> 01:10:56.683
Oh, Jack.

01:10:56.785 --> 01:10:58.619
You're a good kid, but...

01:11:01.223 --> 01:11:03.090
I'm sorry.

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.768
If your clients don't have
their funds into escrow

01:11:12.869 --> 01:11:13.903
by the end of business,

01:11:14.004 --> 01:11:15.370
I will pull the plug
on this thing

01:11:15.471 --> 01:11:17.939
so fast they'll get seasick
going down the drain.

01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:20.276
Did you get that email I sent
with the response to tillinger?

01:11:20.377 --> 01:11:21.577
I need to get that out
immediately.

01:11:22.946 --> 01:11:24.246
You can't send that.

01:11:24.348 --> 01:11:25.816
I'm sick and tired of him
walking all over me.

01:11:25.917 --> 01:11:27.349
It's about time
I threw down the gauntlet.

01:11:28.885 --> 01:11:30.520
What is going on
with you?

01:11:30.621 --> 01:11:34.191
You've been acting like
Attila the hun all day.

01:11:34.292 --> 01:11:35.425
Did something
happen with Jack?

01:11:37.529 --> 01:11:40.096
Katherine!

01:11:40.198 --> 01:11:41.465
Yeah.

01:11:41.566 --> 01:11:42.467
He lied to me.

01:11:42.568 --> 01:11:43.568
He's not a doctor, he's a nurse.

01:11:43.669 --> 01:11:45.336
And I'm an idiot, I fell for it.

01:11:45.437 --> 01:11:49.942
Well, you lied, too.

01:11:50.043 --> 01:11:52.243
You both were pretending
to be something you weren't.

01:11:52.344 --> 01:11:53.945
Yeah, I was not pretending

01:11:54.046 --> 01:11:55.247
to be something
more desirable than I am.

01:11:55.348 --> 01:11:57.015
I was pretending to be
something less desirable

01:11:57.116 --> 01:11:58.717
than I...

01:11:58.818 --> 01:12:00.018
I... I'm...

01:12:01.622 --> 01:12:03.155
I didn't mean that, I'm sorry.

01:12:04.724 --> 01:12:07.894
Maybe you should ask yourself
why you're really upset.

01:12:07.995 --> 01:12:09.529
Because he lied,

01:12:09.630 --> 01:12:13.734
or because you're a bigger snob
than you're willing to admit.

01:12:22.444 --> 01:12:23.744
Where you been, weirdo?

01:12:23.845 --> 01:12:26.181
Mad-dog milly's been
a real pain in the butt.

01:12:26.282 --> 01:12:28.349
Your surgery is
scheduled for the morning.

01:12:28.450 --> 01:12:29.517
No liquids after 10:00.

01:12:29.618 --> 01:12:30.952
There's a light meal.

01:12:31.053 --> 01:12:32.487
Okay, sure.

01:12:34.156 --> 01:12:36.157
The duty nurse
will be in to wake you

01:12:36.259 --> 01:12:37.660
around 6:00
in the morning

01:12:37.761 --> 01:12:39.094
and prep you.

01:12:39.195 --> 01:12:40.962
Where are you
going to be?

01:12:41.063 --> 01:12:42.230
Tomorrow's my day off.

01:12:44.601 --> 01:12:46.269
Your day off?

01:12:46.370 --> 01:12:48.137
Yeah, Brandon, I know
it's hard to believe,

01:12:48.238 --> 01:12:49.907
but I have other things

01:12:50.041 --> 01:12:51.741
other than
just being a nurse.

01:12:51.842 --> 01:12:53.776
I have a life,
my own problems.

01:12:53.877 --> 01:12:54.912
So you give me
this stupid book,

01:12:55.013 --> 01:12:56.680
act like you're my friend,
like you actually care,

01:12:56.781 --> 01:12:58.048
and you're not even
going to show up for this?

01:12:58.149 --> 01:12:59.016
Listen, buddy...

01:12:59.117 --> 01:13:00.785
"Buddy"? Right.

01:13:07.593 --> 01:13:09.794
Brandon, I'm sorry.

01:13:09.895 --> 01:13:11.763
Of course, I'll be here.

01:13:11.864 --> 01:13:14.600
I'm all over this.

01:13:14.668 --> 01:13:16.000
Know what, forget it.

01:13:20.440 --> 01:13:23.576
All you adults
are a bunch of phonies.

01:13:26.980 --> 01:13:29.214
Sometimes, I'm glad
I'm an old man.

01:13:29.316 --> 01:13:32.118
You're not an old man.

01:13:32.219 --> 01:13:33.787
Sure as heck
feel like it.

01:13:33.888 --> 01:13:34.788
How is she?

01:13:34.889 --> 01:13:37.091
Well, she won't talk about it.

01:13:37.192 --> 01:13:38.225
Acts like
nothing even happened.

01:13:38.327 --> 01:13:40.527
What I don't understand is

01:13:40.628 --> 01:13:43.331
how she allowed herself
to be deceived like that.

01:13:43.432 --> 01:13:44.332
She's usually so careful.

01:13:44.433 --> 01:13:45.633
From what I can tell,

01:13:45.734 --> 01:13:48.337
he's a professional con man
who won't take no for an answer.

01:13:48.438 --> 01:13:49.838
What do you mean?

01:13:49.939 --> 01:13:51.072
You talked to him?

01:13:51.173 --> 01:13:53.474
Oh, well, I, uh...

01:13:54.844 --> 01:13:56.211
Just a brief encounter.

01:13:56.312 --> 01:13:58.313
I hope I didn't
overstep my bounds,

01:13:58.414 --> 01:14:00.917
but I do feel I have a stake
in the matter.

01:14:01.018 --> 01:14:02.151
Out with it, Charles.

01:14:03.186 --> 01:14:05.721
I offered him some money...

01:14:05.822 --> 01:14:07.256
To break it off with her.

01:14:07.358 --> 01:14:09.025
But he declined.

01:14:09.126 --> 01:14:10.727
He said he'd prefer
to take his chances

01:14:10.828 --> 01:14:12.930
and that she'd still want him.

01:14:15.032 --> 01:14:17.033
Can you believe that?

01:14:17.134 --> 01:14:19.303
Hey...

01:14:19.404 --> 01:14:20.904
Get better,
all right?

01:14:25.378 --> 01:14:26.344
That son of a gun.

01:14:38.191 --> 01:14:40.660
Hey, Brandon!

01:14:44.799 --> 01:14:46.566
Hey, buddy.

01:14:46.668 --> 01:14:48.236
Hey, loser.

01:14:48.337 --> 01:14:50.837
Didn't have anything
better to do on your day off?

01:14:50.938 --> 01:14:53.307
Not a chance.

01:14:54.476 --> 01:14:56.310
You're gonna do great in there.

01:14:56.412 --> 01:14:58.279
How do you know for sure?

01:14:58.380 --> 01:15:00.349
Because you're not
the kind of guy who quits

01:15:00.450 --> 01:15:01.749
when you're in the middle
of something.

01:15:16.900 --> 01:15:18.735
I've been
looking for those.

01:15:20.471 --> 01:15:22.439
So, what
do you think?

01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.741
Oh.

01:15:23.842 --> 01:15:25.875
It's a very ambitious project.

01:15:25.976 --> 01:15:28.278
400,000 square feet
of retail space.

01:15:28.379 --> 01:15:29.447
A casino
and an amphitheater

01:15:29.548 --> 01:15:30.548
in the hotel.

01:15:30.649 --> 01:15:32.383
We call it the lake Tahoe
of the midwest.

01:15:34.686 --> 01:15:36.288
How about the residents?

01:15:36.389 --> 01:15:37.822
It's going to drastically
change the character

01:15:37.923 --> 01:15:38.823
of the whole area.

01:15:38.924 --> 01:15:39.824
Are they not
opposed to it?

01:15:39.925 --> 01:15:41.760
Naturally.

01:15:41.861 --> 01:15:43.128
But they'll come around.

01:15:43.229 --> 01:15:45.130
You're so sure.

01:15:45.231 --> 01:15:47.133
Everybody has a price.

01:15:49.036 --> 01:15:50.569
I'm glad you're taking
an interest.

01:15:50.670 --> 01:15:52.170
With your father
out of commission,

01:15:52.271 --> 01:15:53.206
we need someone
from your side

01:15:53.307 --> 01:15:55.274
to steer this thing.

01:15:55.375 --> 01:15:57.376
You know, Katherine...

01:15:58.479 --> 01:16:01.315
I, uh, wanted
to let you know

01:16:01.416 --> 01:16:05.052
none of this has changed
the way I feel about you.

01:16:07.055 --> 01:16:08.322
How do you feel about me?

01:16:09.290 --> 01:16:10.724
What do you mean?

01:16:12.294 --> 01:16:14.061
Do you love me?

01:16:14.162 --> 01:16:15.896
Yeah.

01:16:15.997 --> 01:16:16.897
Sure...

01:16:16.998 --> 01:16:19.134
Yes, of course.

01:16:20.803 --> 01:16:22.771
Why?

01:16:22.872 --> 01:16:24.774
If you could name a reason.

01:16:24.875 --> 01:16:27.041
Well, uh...

01:16:27.143 --> 01:16:28.042
Let's see.

01:16:28.144 --> 01:16:30.546
Where to begin?

01:16:30.647 --> 01:16:32.414
You are a brilliant
businesswoman.

01:16:32.516 --> 01:16:34.683
Strong-willed,
but not unreasonable.

01:16:34.785 --> 01:16:35.719
Sensible.

01:16:35.820 --> 01:16:38.587
Um, we share a lot of
the same interests,

01:16:38.688 --> 01:16:40.022
ambitions, political views,

01:16:40.123 --> 01:16:41.291
and, of course,
I find you very attractive,

01:16:41.392 --> 01:16:42.592
physically.

01:16:44.862 --> 01:16:46.296
And you're very spirited.

01:16:46.397 --> 01:16:48.866
Always keeping me on my toes.

01:16:48.967 --> 01:16:51.301
Okay.

01:16:51.402 --> 01:16:53.571
What if...

01:16:53.672 --> 01:16:55.439
What if I had Debbie's job?

01:16:55.541 --> 01:16:58.843
But you don't.

01:17:00.180 --> 01:17:01.180
No...

01:17:02.147 --> 01:17:04.382
I could if I could type.

01:17:11.258 --> 01:17:12.792
Thank you.

01:17:14.627 --> 01:17:16.595
Thank you.

01:17:22.636 --> 01:17:23.604
Debbie, cover me.

01:17:23.705 --> 01:17:24.572
Where are you going?

01:17:24.673 --> 01:17:28.575
I'm going to see a guy
about my gist.

01:17:28.676 --> 01:17:30.511
Her gist?

01:17:30.612 --> 01:17:32.246
Gist?

01:17:33.315 --> 01:17:35.450
Hi.

01:17:35.551 --> 01:17:37.852
So, he's in stable condition.

01:17:37.953 --> 01:17:39.987
The valve surgery
went very well.

01:17:40.088 --> 01:17:41.223
Okay?

01:17:41.324 --> 01:17:43.358
We'll let you know when
you can go and see him.

01:17:43.459 --> 01:17:44.860
Okay.

01:17:44.961 --> 01:17:45.994
Nurse Cooper,

01:17:46.095 --> 01:17:48.231
he was asking about you
when he woke up.

01:17:48.332 --> 01:17:49.232
I'm sure he'll be
glad to know

01:17:49.333 --> 01:17:50.465
that you're
still here.

01:17:59.310 --> 01:18:00.410
Katherine, listen...

01:18:00.511 --> 01:18:02.178
You listen.

01:18:04.214 --> 01:18:07.784
Daddy, my whole life,

01:18:07.886 --> 01:18:09.786
I've done things your way.

01:18:09.888 --> 01:18:11.322
I went to the schools you chose,

01:18:11.423 --> 01:18:13.324
I studied the things
you considered important,

01:18:13.425 --> 01:18:16.059
I took the jobs you thought

01:18:16.160 --> 01:18:17.028
would best advance
my career,

01:18:17.129 --> 01:18:18.029
and I've been
very lucky,

01:18:18.130 --> 01:18:19.163
because you've made
good decisions for me.

01:18:19.265 --> 01:18:20.164
Katherine...

01:18:20.266 --> 01:18:21.132
But listen,

01:18:21.233 --> 01:18:24.136
you also taught me

01:18:24.237 --> 01:18:26.905
that a good deal
isn't necessarily the one

01:18:27.006 --> 01:18:28.706
that makes
the most sense on paper.

01:18:29.876 --> 01:18:30.943
Sometimes,
you need to

01:18:31.044 --> 01:18:31.944
lay the numbers aside

01:18:32.045 --> 01:18:34.246
and trust your instincts.

01:18:36.717 --> 01:18:38.284
What I'm trying to say is...

01:18:40.888 --> 01:18:43.423
Jack...

01:18:43.524 --> 01:18:47.962
He's the one for me.

01:18:48.063 --> 01:18:50.130
And at the end of the day,

01:18:50.231 --> 01:18:51.131
this is just one

01:18:51.232 --> 01:18:53.100
that I need to trust
my instincts on,

01:18:53.201 --> 01:18:57.405
and my gut is telling me
if I pass up on this deal,

01:18:57.506 --> 01:18:59.474
I will regret it
for the rest of my life.

01:18:59.575 --> 01:19:01.676
I gather from your tone,

01:19:01.777 --> 01:19:04.078
you don't care
to hear my opinion.

01:19:05.081 --> 01:19:06.782
I love you,

01:19:06.883 --> 01:19:09.785
but I'm not that little girl
on the pony anymore.

01:19:09.886 --> 01:19:13.722
I can take care of myself.

01:19:13.790 --> 01:19:17.493
I couldn't agree more.

01:19:24.669 --> 01:19:26.302
Thanks.

01:19:26.403 --> 01:19:28.371
Now go get him.

01:19:28.505 --> 01:19:30.007
Okay.

01:19:34.412 --> 01:19:35.280
Excuse me.

01:19:35.381 --> 01:19:36.381
Hi.

01:19:36.482 --> 01:19:38.482
Is nurse Cooper here today?

01:19:38.583 --> 01:19:39.583
It's his day off,

01:19:39.684 --> 01:19:41.486
but I think he might be here
visiting a patient.

01:19:41.587 --> 01:19:42.787
Oh.

01:19:42.888 --> 01:19:44.823
Would it be possible
to page him?

01:19:44.924 --> 01:19:47.493
Oh, sorry, not
when he's off duty.

01:19:48.495 --> 01:19:49.995
Right.

01:20:02.776 --> 01:20:03.709
"'...do you want to get
a table inside

01:20:03.810 --> 01:20:04.978
"and have a drink or something?'

01:20:05.079 --> 01:20:06.480
"I said to her finally.

01:20:06.581 --> 01:20:07.481
That's the most... '"

01:20:07.582 --> 01:20:09.850
hi.

01:20:09.951 --> 01:20:10.985
I'm paging

01:20:11.086 --> 01:20:13.254
<i>nurse Cooper.</i>

01:20:13.355 --> 01:20:16.556
<i>Please report to</i>
<i>the cardiac care unit asap?</i>

01:20:16.691 --> 01:20:17.625
<i>Or "stat."</i>

01:20:17.726 --> 01:20:18.726
Katherine?

01:20:18.827 --> 01:20:19.794
Who's Katherine?

01:20:19.895 --> 01:20:21.696
She's my girlfriend.

01:20:21.797 --> 01:20:23.499
I mean, she was,
when she was Debbie.

01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.833
It's...
It's kind of a long story.

01:20:25.934 --> 01:20:26.968
<i>It's not a medical emergency.</i>

01:20:27.069 --> 01:20:28.669
<i>It's more of a-a...</i>

01:20:28.772 --> 01:20:30.806
Of a love emergency?

01:20:30.907 --> 01:20:32.608
Well what are you
waiting for, cinderella?

01:20:32.675 --> 01:20:33.942
Your pumpkin
to turn into a carriage?

01:20:36.647 --> 01:20:38.680
<i>I don't know if you can</i>
<i>hear me, Jack, but, uh...</i>

01:20:40.083 --> 01:20:42.385
I'm sorry.

01:20:42.486 --> 01:20:45.288
What the devil is going on?

01:20:45.389 --> 01:20:48.459
I had no right to judge you,

01:20:48.560 --> 01:20:50.427
especially when
you'd already shown me

01:20:50.528 --> 01:20:53.030
the kind of man you are.

01:20:54.499 --> 01:20:58.770
I'm in love with you.

01:20:58.871 --> 01:20:59.938
And I didn't
fall in love with you

01:21:00.039 --> 01:21:02.306
because I thought
you were a doctor.

01:21:02.407 --> 01:21:03.374
I love you

01:21:03.475 --> 01:21:07.446
because of
who you are.

01:21:07.547 --> 01:21:10.449
So...

01:21:10.550 --> 01:21:11.918
Sorry!

01:21:12.019 --> 01:21:14.319
Um... okay.

01:21:14.420 --> 01:21:15.587
That was beautiful, honey.

01:21:15.688 --> 01:21:17.156
Thanks.

01:21:20.427 --> 01:21:21.427
<i>Attention all visitors.</i>

01:21:21.528 --> 01:21:22.763
<i>Would Katherine Benson</i>

01:21:22.864 --> 01:21:25.865
<i>please report to</i>
<i>the South end of the hall?</i>

01:21:25.966 --> 01:21:26.999
<i>Stat.</i>

01:21:28.435 --> 01:21:29.670
Well, it looks like

01:21:29.771 --> 01:21:31.772
you just won yourself
the prize of the century.

01:21:31.873 --> 01:21:32.773
Yeah.

01:21:32.874 --> 01:21:33.907
Go on and claim him.

01:21:34.008 --> 01:21:36.144
<i>Alone, preferably.</i>

01:21:48.625 --> 01:21:49.958
You heard all that?

01:21:50.059 --> 01:21:51.359
I heard all that.

01:21:51.460 --> 01:21:52.560
Okay.

01:21:52.662 --> 01:21:53.629
Jack, I...

01:21:53.730 --> 01:21:55.131
No, wait.

01:21:55.232 --> 01:21:56.398
I want you to know

01:21:56.500 --> 01:21:57.600
that I never meant
for things to go

01:21:57.701 --> 01:22:00.370
the way that they did.

01:22:00.471 --> 01:22:04.473
I realized that

01:22:04.574 --> 01:22:05.876
you are the woman

01:22:05.977 --> 01:22:10.113
that I want to share
the rest of my life with,

01:22:10.214 --> 01:22:13.717
and I was scared.

01:22:13.818 --> 01:22:17.021
And I promise that I will always
tell you the truth

01:22:17.122 --> 01:22:18.856
even when it's hard.

01:22:18.957 --> 01:22:21.792
Me too.

01:22:21.894 --> 01:22:24.129
And every single day,

01:22:24.230 --> 01:22:26.764
I will be the best man
I know to be.

01:22:29.903 --> 01:22:31.803
I love you,

01:22:31.905 --> 01:22:33.272
Katherine.
