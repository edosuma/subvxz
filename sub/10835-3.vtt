00:01.168 --> 00:02.836
Previously on 90210:

00:02.961 --> 00:05.005
HARRY:
Come on, Beverly Hills is going
to be great for our family.

00:05.130 --> 00:07.800
We got the weather, we got
the palm trees with the...

00:07.925 --> 00:09.635
more palm trees.
More palm trees.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.178
You had, like,
a million friends.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.263
Back home.
And they all knew

00:13.388 --> 00:14.515
about the whole adoption story.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.642
Ethan, this is Annie, the
new principal's daughter.

00:16.767 --> 00:19.436
Annie, my boyfriend,
Ethan.
Yeah, well, actually,

00:19.561 --> 00:20.855
yeah, we-we know each other.
We met, like, two summers ago?

00:20.980 --> 00:23.607
Hey, Ty.
Yeah.
You want to grab dinner
tonight after rehearsal?

00:23.732 --> 00:24.441
You can Spence anybody.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.442
Annie!

00:25.567 --> 00:26.735
Ty.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.321
I wanted to bring you these.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.781
If you guys want to grab
some food, I can watch Sammy.

00:30.906 --> 00:32.825
You just got here.
Don't worry, I'll be
here for a while.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.242
I went to Dad's
office last night,

00:34.368 --> 00:36.745
and I saw him there
kissing another woman.

00:36.871 --> 00:38.789
I'm gonna take
you home, okay?
Okay.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.415
It's okay.

00:42.125 --> 00:44.085
In eighth grade,
my dad had an affair.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.296
I had to tell someone,

00:46.421 --> 00:48.674
so I told my best friend, Naomi.

00:48.799 --> 00:50.467
She promised me that
she wouldn't tell anyone.

00:50.592 --> 00:52.427
So she told everyone.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.397
HARRY:
Well, I got some

01:03.522 --> 01:04.690
bad news.

01:04.815 --> 01:06.149
I just got off the phone

01:06.274 --> 01:07.568
with your drama teacher.

01:07.693 --> 01:08.819
Got a family emergency

01:08.944 --> 01:10.571
in Atlanta and she
is taking an indefinite

01:10.696 --> 01:11.697
leave of absence.

01:11.822 --> 01:13.908
So what does that mean?

01:14.033 --> 01:15.868
You're not canceling
the musical, are you?

01:15.993 --> 01:17.912
Well, if I can't find
somebody else

01:18.037 --> 01:19.538
I don't know that
I have a choice.

01:19.663 --> 01:20.873
Dad, no!

01:20.998 --> 01:23.333
We've been rehearsing
for weeks

01:23.458 --> 01:25.210
and the show is amazing.
Can't you just find someone

01:25.335 --> 01:26.336
to supervise us?

01:26.461 --> 01:27.588
Harry, how hard
could it be

01:27.713 --> 01:28.756
to find an acting coach in L.A.?

01:28.881 --> 01:30.549
I mean, I could throw a rock
out the window

01:30.674 --> 01:31.633
and hit an actor.

01:31.759 --> 01:32.509
Fine.
I'll do it.

01:32.634 --> 01:34.678
What?
What?

01:34.803 --> 01:36.263
I'll direct the musical.

01:36.388 --> 01:37.222
Uh, but...

01:37.347 --> 01:38.766
but, Grandma, uh...

01:38.891 --> 01:40.642
you're so busy
writing your memoir.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.185
Sweetheart,

01:42.310 --> 01:44.187
when the theater is in pain,

01:44.312 --> 01:45.647
I come to mend the wound.

01:46.690 --> 01:48.149
O... Okay.

01:48.275 --> 01:50.402
Tabitha, that is
a very nice offer.

01:50.527 --> 01:51.570
Annie, you are
very lucky.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.488
I'm so excited.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.489
I'm excited, too.

01:55.991 --> 01:57.785
I have to remember some of those

01:57.910 --> 02:00.829
breathing exercises
I used to do.

02:00.955 --> 02:04.666
I had a director who'd say,

02:04.792 --> 02:06.919
"If you're not breathing
from your ass

02:07.044 --> 02:09.378
"and reaching
to the skies,

02:09.503 --> 02:11.298
the back row
won't hear you."

02:13.759 --> 02:15.761
I slept with him.

02:17.429 --> 02:18.847
Oh...

02:20.724 --> 02:22.601
Now I know you don't love it,
but it's great, and, honey...

02:22.726 --> 02:24.269
Mom, okay, stop?

02:24.394 --> 02:26.521
I think that your
foundation's a little dark.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.774
It's the same one
I use every single day.

02:28.899 --> 02:29.900
Merry early Christmas,
everybody.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.234
Both my girls look beautiful.

02:31.359 --> 02:32.778
Why are we shooting the
Christmas photo without Jen?

02:32.903 --> 02:33.904
She sending us
a picture.

02:34.029 --> 02:35.280
We're gonna
Photoshop it in.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.198
What? That's the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.034
Can we just
shoot this, please?

02:39.159 --> 02:40.702
All right,
everyone get in real close.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.832
Linda and Bob are gonna
start renovating.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.875
So I was gonna offer
them the beach house.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.627
I've already offered it
to somebody at work

02:48.752 --> 02:49.962
for the same reason.

02:50.087 --> 02:51.046
Charles, would you mind turning
towards Tracy?

02:51.170 --> 02:52.547
There's a big space right
here between you two.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.715
I wish I could live
at the beach house.

02:53.841 --> 02:54.883
What does that mean?

02:55.009 --> 02:56.343
Tracy, you're
looking a little stiff.

02:56.468 --> 02:57.678
Charles, can you
put your arms around

02:57.803 --> 03:00.347
both ladies, please?

03:00.472 --> 03:01.682
Naomi, can I get a smile?

03:04.143 --> 03:05.184
And, Tracy and Charles,
can I get

03:05.310 --> 03:07.186
a little kiss
between you two?
(cell phone rings)

03:07.312 --> 03:09.690
Could you hurry up, please?
It's really hot out here.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.483
It's an out-of-town emergency.
Give me a second.

03:13.610 --> 03:14.778
(scoffs)

03:14.903 --> 03:15.863
Why do we even bother?

03:15.988 --> 03:17.572
Naomi...

03:19.992 --> 03:21.660
It'll be just a second.

03:21.785 --> 03:23.954
Okay.

03:26.123 --> 03:27.708
Dixon, your mom is
driving me to school.

03:27.833 --> 03:28.542
You can take my car.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.835
Sweet.

03:29.960 --> 03:30.919
You call the Realtor
this morning?

03:31.045 --> 03:32.671
Only one couple looked
at the house this month.

03:32.796 --> 03:34.548
Not surprising.

03:34.673 --> 03:35.632
Tough market.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.342
What's going on?

03:37.467 --> 03:39.302
We're having trouble
selling the house in Kansas.

03:39.427 --> 03:41.722
Is that a bad thing?

03:41.847 --> 03:43.557
It's not a good thing.

03:43.682 --> 03:46.226
We're paying a mortgage on
a house we're not living in.

03:46.351 --> 03:47.352
It's not like
we're paying rent here.

03:47.477 --> 03:49.229
Yeah, but we still
got expenses.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.565
We got moving expenses,
gas prices...

03:53.400 --> 03:54.735
Hey, don't worry about it.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.361
We're fine.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.411
Hi, Mom.

04:04.536 --> 04:05.954
Where are we going
for dinner tonight?

04:06.080 --> 04:07.873
I made reservations at Craft.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.833
Is Dad coming?

04:09.958 --> 04:11.459
He has a meeting.

04:11.585 --> 04:14.004
Is that code for

04:14.129 --> 04:15.547
"sleeping with his girlfriend"?

04:15.672 --> 04:16.798
Naomi...

04:16.923 --> 04:18.550
Mom, how can you
live like this?

04:18.675 --> 04:21.053
How can you just accept that
Dad's with another woman?

04:21.178 --> 04:22.596
How is that okay?
Can you explain that to me?

04:22.721 --> 04:23.680
'Cause I just don't get it.

04:23.805 --> 04:24.973
It's just a casual fling,

04:25.099 --> 04:26.307
that's all.

04:26.433 --> 04:27.475
She doesn't even live here.

04:29.603 --> 04:31.980
So what, Mom?

04:32.106 --> 04:34.149
He's still cheating on you.

04:34.274 --> 04:37.569
This is between me
and your dad.

04:37.694 --> 04:39.821
Stay out of it.

04:39.947 --> 04:42.574
I'm not discussing this
with you again.

04:42.699 --> 04:43.742
Do you understand?

04:45.744 --> 04:47.662
Perfectly.

04:56.964 --> 04:59.049
I wish we could've done
breakfast at the Peach Pit.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.341
I hate early morning meetings.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.969
Don't worry about it.

05:02.094 --> 05:03.344
I'm getting a kick
out of being here.

05:03.470 --> 05:05.180
I can almost still
hear the chanting.

05:05.305 --> 05:07.682
"Donna Martin graduates.
Donna Martin graduates."

05:07.808 --> 05:08.892
That's crazy.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.144
Oh, thank you very much.

05:10.269 --> 05:11.979
Now that's gonna be
stuck in my head all day.

05:12.104 --> 05:14.314
Speaking of,
have you seen Donna?
Yes.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.566
And, oh, my God, her baby
is so cute, I can't stand it.

05:16.691 --> 05:17.943
I know.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.736
How's the play?
It's good.

05:19.861 --> 05:21.029
I mean, the Taper just went
through a renovation

05:21.155 --> 05:23.198
so it's a really nice
house to perform in.

05:23.323 --> 05:24.074
You're gonna come
see me, right?

05:24.199 --> 05:25.742
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

05:25.867 --> 05:27.619
So...

05:27.744 --> 05:28.912
dirt.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.664
What?

05:30.789 --> 05:32.040
Ryan.

05:32.166 --> 05:33.625
Ryan.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.002
Okay. Um...

05:35.127 --> 05:37.171
He's nice.
I like him.

05:37.296 --> 05:40.132
We work together,
so it's awkward.

05:40.257 --> 05:41.967
And he's ten years
younger than me,

05:42.092 --> 05:43.218
which makes it bizarre.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.595
I asked him where he was
when Kurt Cobain died

05:45.720 --> 05:47.055
and he said he was
watching cartoons.

05:48.974 --> 05:49.975
Does he know about Ryan?

05:52.144 --> 05:53.478
Why would he need to know?

05:53.603 --> 05:54.521
It's none of his business.

05:54.646 --> 05:56.815
Well, it may be his business

05:56.940 --> 05:58.066
if things get more serious
with Ryan.

05:58.192 --> 05:59.234
You know, because of Sammy.

06:01.111 --> 06:02.737
Well, let me worry about that.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.906
Fair enough.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.577
Hi.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.872
Hey.

06:11.997 --> 06:12.873
Ethan, I'm a mess.

06:12.998 --> 06:14.833
I'm freaking out.

06:14.958 --> 06:16.168
My family is so fake.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.086
I mean, my sister's
being Photoshopped

06:18.212 --> 06:19.963
into the Christmas card
from Paris.

06:20.088 --> 06:23.342
My dad is kissing my mom
while having an affair.

06:23.466 --> 06:26.970
Look, I don't... I'm sorry
you're going through this.

06:27.095 --> 06:29.723
Thank you.

06:31.141 --> 06:32.893
But, look, Naomi...
I know.

06:33.018 --> 06:35.436
We're not together anymore.

06:38.815 --> 06:40.399
But it's really good
to talk to you.

06:43.237 --> 06:44.946
(car alarm blares)
Oh, damn.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.115
(sighs heavily)

06:50.327 --> 06:51.995
Why were trying
to fit that tank

06:52.120 --> 06:54.081
into a compact space?

06:54.206 --> 06:56.208
Uh... I thought I had room.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.667
Do you know how much parts cost
on German cars?

06:57.792 --> 06:58.919
A lot?

06:59.044 --> 07:00.587
Just give me
your insurance info.

07:00.712 --> 07:02.339
Um... listen, uh...

07:02.463 --> 07:05.175
do you think there's any way
we can handle this between us?

07:05.300 --> 07:08.762
Oh, you don't
have insurance.

07:08.887 --> 07:12.099
No, no, my dad does, but I
don't want him to find out.

07:12.224 --> 07:14.059
You know, he won't let me
drive the car anymore.

07:14.184 --> 07:15.810
I can get you the cash.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.020
I'm good for it, I swear.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.858
It's not like you don't know
what school I go to, man.

07:21.983 --> 07:23.526
It's not like I'm gonna
disappear or anything.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.528
Just please do me
this solid, man, please.

07:27.364 --> 07:29.199
My dad's away on business
for a couple weeks.

07:29.324 --> 07:30.909
I just need the cash
before he gets back.

07:33.745 --> 07:34.829
Hey, Kelly.

07:34.955 --> 07:36.039
Hey.
Hey.

07:36.164 --> 07:37.582
Um, so about Saturday.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.293
There's a new pizza place
in Silverlake.

07:39.418 --> 07:41.962
And apparently it's good,
like New York good.

07:42.087 --> 07:43.463
Oh, Saturday,
I can't do it

07:43.588 --> 07:45.966
because Silver's not going to be
around to help me with Sammy.

07:46.091 --> 07:47.717
How about Brenda?

07:47.842 --> 07:49.136
She has a show
that night.

07:49.261 --> 07:51.012
Sammy's dad,
does he ever take him?

07:51.138 --> 07:52.973
What?

07:53.098 --> 07:54.141
Sammy's dad.
Did I...

07:54.266 --> 07:55.683
Did I say something wrong?
No.

07:55.809 --> 07:56.935
No, it's fine.

07:57.060 --> 07:59.187
Um... he just...
he doesn't live here.

07:59.313 --> 08:01.189
Where does he live?

08:01.315 --> 08:03.150
All over kind of.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.693
Yeah, he's, uh,
he's a do-gooder.

08:05.819 --> 08:08.989
He's actually halfway across
the world right now

08:09.114 --> 08:10.157
doing charity work.

08:10.282 --> 08:13.034
Impressive.
Yeah.

08:13.160 --> 08:15.954
Well, maybe we can
do Sunday, okay?
Okay.

08:16.079 --> 08:17.289
I'll see what I can do.
Great.

08:18.957 --> 08:20.959
Hey, Annie, I haven't
seen you around.

08:21.084 --> 08:22.085
I've been around.

08:22.210 --> 08:24.712
Busy with the play.

08:24.838 --> 08:27.507
So how's Naomi?

08:27.632 --> 08:29.843
Uh, just a lot of
really intense stuff

08:29.968 --> 08:31.136
going on with
her family.

08:31.261 --> 08:33.138
Yeah. Yeah,
it seemed like it.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.140
So are you guys like...?

08:35.265 --> 08:37.808
No, no, no.
No, uh...

08:37.933 --> 08:38.977
She was just
flipping out and

08:39.102 --> 08:40.020
I know how to
deal with her.

08:40.145 --> 08:41.104
Right.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.897
What about you and Ty?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.065
What's up with
that whole...?

08:44.191 --> 08:45.817
Ah... nothing really.

08:45.942 --> 08:47.986
Oh.

08:48.111 --> 08:51.072
Well, I had a lot of fun hanging
out with you the other night.

08:51.198 --> 08:52.699
Me, too.
Well, good.

08:52.824 --> 08:54.117
Do you want to
maybe do that again?

08:54.242 --> 08:56.036
Like Thursday?

08:56.161 --> 09:00.165
Uh, Thursday night
I have nothing going on.

09:00.290 --> 09:01.582
(chuckling)
Uh, cool.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.293
Well, I'm with my brother
all afternoon,

09:03.418 --> 09:05.920
so you want to just meet at
the Peach Pit like around 6:00?

09:06.046 --> 09:07.088
Yeah. Cool.
See you then.

09:07.214 --> 09:08.131
Awesome.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.073
Oh!

09:33.198 --> 09:34.157
Hi.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.158
Hi.

09:35.283 --> 09:38.412
So, the other night,

09:38.537 --> 09:40.163
I left without
saying good-bye.

09:40.288 --> 09:41.664
I'm sorry about that.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.958
Oh, no, it's no big deal.

09:44.084 --> 09:45.210
Well, I think it's a big deal

09:45.335 --> 09:47.045
'cause I didn't get
to hang out with you.

09:47.170 --> 09:49.339
Anyway...

09:49.464 --> 09:51.466
Vampire Weekend's playing
this secret show at the Avalon

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
and my cousin got me
VIP tickets.

09:53.134 --> 09:54.094
It's Thursday.

09:54.219 --> 09:55.887
You want to go?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.138
Oh, I can't.

09:57.264 --> 09:58.056
I have plans.

09:58.181 --> 09:59.974
Okay.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.393
Uh, is it like
a group hang?

10:01.518 --> 10:03.311
'Cause I don't have
to go to the show.

10:03.437 --> 10:05.313
My cousin's in
the music biz

10:05.439 --> 10:06.981
and hooks me up
all the time.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.234
Um, it's-it's not
really a group hang.

10:09.359 --> 10:12.070
It's more of a one-on-one

10:12.195 --> 10:13.196
kind of thing.

10:13.321 --> 10:14.948
Got it.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.325
I'll see you around.

10:23.164 --> 10:25.166
Silver...

10:25.292 --> 10:27.252
Hey, hey, Silver.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.087
Can I talk to you?

10:29.212 --> 10:30.671
Headphones.

10:30.797 --> 10:32.632
You have
a nanosecond.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.554
Please don't blog about
my dad's affair.

10:37.678 --> 10:39.222
You thought my family
problems were gossip.

10:39.347 --> 10:41.099
Why shouldn't I treat
yours the same way?

10:41.224 --> 10:44.144
Look, I've said it before,
but I'll say it again--

10:44.269 --> 10:45.686
I'm so sorry.

10:45.812 --> 10:46.938
I'm so sorry, okay?

10:47.063 --> 10:48.398
Because I get it now.

10:48.523 --> 10:49.816
I know what
you were going through.

10:49.941 --> 10:51.401
What I did was really messed up.

10:51.526 --> 10:54.237
Yeah, it was really messed up.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.912
♪ Mama who bore me ♪

11:03.037 --> 11:05.248

11:12.547 --> 11:14.257

No, stop.

11:14.382 --> 11:16.968
My ears are bleeding.

11:17.093 --> 11:19.387
You have no passion, girls.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.223
You got to sing like
your privates are on fire.

11:22.349 --> 11:24.184
For God's sake.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.393
Just because

11:25.519 --> 11:27.479
you're a bunch of rich brats

11:27.604 --> 11:29.439
doesn't mean you
can't have angst.

11:29.564 --> 11:31.316
Channel it.

11:34.235 --> 11:37.155
This is a song
about your mother.

11:37.280 --> 11:39.949
She's been lying to you
about sex,

11:40.074 --> 11:42.076
and it
pisses you off.

11:42.202 --> 11:45.121
You're all teenagers, so I know
you hate your mothers.

11:45.246 --> 11:47.123
I hated mine.

11:47.248 --> 11:48.291
Use the anger.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.834
I will show you how it's done.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.878
Grandma, maybe I...

11:52.003 --> 11:53.880
Annie, I'm not
your grandmother here.

11:54.005 --> 11:55.382
I'm the director.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.342
Everyone...

11:57.467 --> 11:59.844
(music starts)

11:59.969 --> 12:02.138

12:19.280 --> 12:20.240
(music stops)

12:20.365 --> 12:22.367
You've got to move

12:22.492 --> 12:25.078
from the hips
and claim the stage!

12:27.497 --> 12:29.207
ANNIE:
Dad.
Hey.

12:29.332 --> 12:31.209
Dad, you know how

12:31.334 --> 12:33.127
very much I love Grandma,

12:33.253 --> 12:34.295
and it was
a nice idea.

12:34.421 --> 12:35.589
But you have to,

12:35.714 --> 12:38.174
have to find a new
director for the musical.

12:38.299 --> 12:41.428
I cannot replace her.

12:41.553 --> 12:42.887
You have to, okay?

12:43.012 --> 12:43.930
Yes, you can.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.890
She... she makes me do
these crazy heavy

12:46.015 --> 12:48.226
breathing exercises
all the way to school.

12:48.351 --> 12:49.394
And she's so embarrassing.

12:49.519 --> 12:52.230
Sweetheart, just one more week.

12:52.355 --> 12:54.148
TABITHA:
There you are, Harry.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.191
Excuse me, darling.
Uh-huh.

12:55.316 --> 12:56.401
When you have a moment,

12:56.526 --> 12:58.361
I need to go over
the theater budget with you.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.821
The lights need new gels

13:00.947 --> 13:03.366
and the costumes
are not up to par.

13:03.491 --> 13:05.034
Is that coffee on your tie?

13:05.159 --> 13:06.160
What?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.996
Great.

13:09.122 --> 13:11.458
You're seriously
arguing with me? Huh.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.001
Uh, hello.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.086
My mother...

13:15.211 --> 13:16.212
Saw the whole thing.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.255
Hey, now you know
how Annie feels

13:17.380 --> 13:18.590
having you here.

13:21.384 --> 13:22.677
You know people

13:22.801 --> 13:24.429
in the entertainment
industry, right?

13:24.554 --> 13:28.849
Anybody who might be
able to direct a musical?

13:28.975 --> 13:31.645
I think I might
know someone.

13:32.562 --> 13:36.857
(heavy rock beat playing)

13:36.983 --> 13:39.818
(heavy rock beat playing
over radio)

13:41.237 --> 13:42.905
Uh, here.

13:43.030 --> 13:44.574
Thanks.

13:44.699 --> 13:47.285
You caddied at a
country club in Wichita,

13:47.410 --> 13:50.163
cut grass,
shoveled snow...
Mm-hmm.

13:50.288 --> 13:52.165
And this would be
your first real job?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.207
Yes, sir.

13:55.543 --> 13:58.045
You go to West Beverly?

13:58.171 --> 13:59.213
Yes, sir.

13:59.339 --> 14:01.090
I once hired a kid
from West Beverly.

14:01.215 --> 14:02.425
A long time ago.

14:02.550 --> 14:05.094
He was a good, good egg.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.596
Tell you what, I'll try you out.

14:06.721 --> 14:08.014
You don't mess up,

14:08.139 --> 14:09.307
you got the job.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.433
Thank you, sir.

14:10.558 --> 14:12.185
Stop calling me "sir."

14:12.310 --> 14:13.227
The name is Nat.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.271
Thanks, Nat.

14:17.106 --> 14:18.232
Mom?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.109
Like to introduce you
to somebody.

14:20.234 --> 14:21.444
Hi.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.070
This is Brenda Walsh,

14:23.196 --> 14:26.157
a West Beverly alum and a
very big fan of yours.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.575
Really?

14:27.701 --> 14:29.910
Well, it's nice to meet you.

14:30.036 --> 14:31.037
It's an honor
to meet you.

14:31.162 --> 14:32.246
I've seen every
one of your films.

14:32.372 --> 14:34.123
Not every film.

14:34.248 --> 14:35.667
There were some real stinkers
in the '80s.

14:35.792 --> 14:37.418
Well, you were wonderful
in all of them.

14:37.544 --> 14:39.379
Also I saw your Hedda Gabler
at the Ahmanson.

14:39.504 --> 14:43.257
That's the greatest part
ever written for a woman.

14:43.383 --> 14:44.634
I got to play her.

14:44.759 --> 14:46.302
Not as well as you,
of course.

14:46.427 --> 14:48.471
Oh, you're an actor.

14:48.596 --> 14:49.848
Yes.

14:49.972 --> 14:51.683
Mom, opening night
is around the corner.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.184
There's a lot
of work left.

14:53.309 --> 14:54.686
So I thought you
could use some help,

14:54.811 --> 14:56.020
and Brenda offered
to assist.

14:56.145 --> 15:00.191
I thought I was handling this
all rather well.

15:00.316 --> 15:03.444
Oh, well, I've seen
the original production

15:03.570 --> 15:04.320
of Spring Awakening.

15:04.445 --> 15:06.197
And I always think it helps

15:06.322 --> 15:07.948
to have an extra
pair of eyes.

15:08.074 --> 15:09.158
Wonderful.

15:09.283 --> 15:10.159
Fine.

15:10.284 --> 15:12.328
Great.

15:24.382 --> 15:27.719
All right, explain to me,
why didn't you say yes to Ty?

15:27.844 --> 15:29.554
I mean, it's
Vampire Weekend.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.097
It's a secret show.

15:31.222 --> 15:32.473
It's Ty Collins.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.393
Ethan asked me out.

15:35.518 --> 15:37.520
No. No Ethan.

15:37.645 --> 15:38.979
What is wrong with you.

15:39.105 --> 15:40.648
He's off limits.

15:40.774 --> 15:42.567
Ethan and Naomi are over.

15:42.692 --> 15:45.194
They are never over.

15:45.319 --> 15:47.154
Let me explain
something to you.

15:47.280 --> 15:49.783
Naomi and Ethan
have this thing, right?

15:49.908 --> 15:51.992
It's like they're
in this bubble--

15:52.118 --> 15:53.620
this impenetrable bubble.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.789
A bubble?
And no matter

15:55.914 --> 15:57.665
how hard you try,
you can't get in

15:57.791 --> 15:59.166
and you don't want to get in.

15:59.292 --> 16:01.252
Trust me, I stand beside
the bubble and I'm scared.

16:01.377 --> 16:02.712
Well, the bubble has popped.

16:02.837 --> 16:03.630
No, no, you see,

16:03.755 --> 16:05.715
you just think it has.

16:05.840 --> 16:07.842
Silver, I am going out
with Ethan

16:07.967 --> 16:09.636
and you cannot talk me
out of it.

16:09.761 --> 16:11.805
And I'm not scared.

16:11.930 --> 16:13.640
Mm-hmm. I'm going to buy you
a box of tissues.

16:15.266 --> 16:16.350
So...

16:16.476 --> 16:18.227
what can I get you ladies?

16:18.352 --> 16:19.520
Wait,

16:19.646 --> 16:20.647
you're working here?

16:20.772 --> 16:22.440
Yeah.

16:22.565 --> 16:25.443
Are you trying to make me
look bad with Mom and Dad?

16:25.568 --> 16:27.153
No, I'm trying
to make me look good.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.322
I've been messing up
since I got here,

16:29.447 --> 16:30.657
so, you know, I'm trying
to do something

16:30.782 --> 16:31.741
a little more responsible.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.284
(laughing)

16:33.409 --> 16:34.452
Kiss ass.

16:34.577 --> 16:36.370
Hey, you shouldn't
be talking.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.664
Uh-uh.

16:37.789 --> 16:39.999
So can I get you anything?

16:45.254 --> 16:46.840
TRACY:
The digital proof is in.

16:46.965 --> 16:49.467
Naomi! Come take
a look at this.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.135
I think I'm going
to order 500 more.

16:51.260 --> 16:53.137
At least.
I think you look beautiful.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.472
Thank you.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.934
Gross.
I look terrible.

16:58.058 --> 16:59.268
Well, you've been
outvoted, kiddo,

16:59.393 --> 17:00.770
'cause Jen likes
that one, too.

17:00.895 --> 17:01.771
I think you
look great, honey.

17:01.896 --> 17:03.731
Great? I look high.
No, you don't.

17:03.857 --> 17:05.858
Were you high?
(phone rings)

17:05.983 --> 17:07.359
Oh, that's the
office calling.

17:07.484 --> 17:09.362
Give me a second.

17:09.487 --> 17:10.780
Yeah, I'll be
there at 8:00.

17:10.905 --> 17:14.367
♪ Outside's in control... ♪

17:17.871 --> 17:19.664
(Harry and Debbie laughing)

17:19.789 --> 17:21.374
That's funny.

17:21.499 --> 17:22.666
Hey.
Hey.

17:22.791 --> 17:23.877
Hey.
You're home late.

17:24.002 --> 17:27.547
Uh, yeah, I got a job
at the Peach Pit.

17:27.672 --> 17:29.382
What?
W-when did that happen?

17:29.507 --> 17:30.800
Just today.

17:30.925 --> 17:32.092
They said they
needed help.

17:32.218 --> 17:34.721
And, Dad, you know girls
in Beverly Hills.

17:34.846 --> 17:36.973
They like expensive stuff

17:37.097 --> 17:38.725
and expensive places.
Yes, they do.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.476
I want to roll in style.

17:40.601 --> 17:41.644
Maybe one day

17:41.769 --> 17:43.270
get a nicer car.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.438
No... no offense.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.565
None taken.

17:45.690 --> 17:47.274
It is a piece of crap.

17:47.400 --> 17:48.401
(laughs)

17:48.526 --> 17:50.110
Yeah.
Dixon...

17:50.236 --> 17:51.988
Having a job, good thing,

17:52.112 --> 17:54.448
but I wish you would've
discussed it with us first.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.325
You guys don't want me
to take it?

17:56.450 --> 17:57.952
No, you can. You can.

17:58.077 --> 18:00.747
Uh, but I don't
want it to interfere

18:00.872 --> 18:02.456
with your schoolwork
or lacrosse practice.

18:02.582 --> 18:04.918
It won't.

18:05.043 --> 18:06.126
NAOMI:
Mom, I'll be right down.

18:06.252 --> 18:08.087
I'm just saying
good-bye to Dad.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.425
(shower running)

18:29.108 --> 18:30.860
WOMAN (on phone):
Bon Ami Beverly Hills,
this is Gail.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.570
How can I help you?

18:33.654 --> 18:36.115
Hello? Hello?

18:47.877 --> 18:48.920
DIXON:
Thanks for the ride to work.

18:49.045 --> 18:50.379
All right,
all right, focus.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.172
All right.
Okay.

18:52.298 --> 18:54.467
Which organ
produces bile?

18:55.885 --> 18:58.554
Um...

18:58.679 --> 19:00.389
the pancreas.

19:00.514 --> 19:01.933
Liver.

19:02.058 --> 19:04.727
All right,
name the three classes

19:04.852 --> 19:06.479
of digestive enzymes.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.397
I know this one.
I know this one, um...

19:08.522 --> 19:13.778
lipases, uh, amylases

19:13.903 --> 19:16.363
and... and, um...

19:16.489 --> 19:18.908
And?

19:19.033 --> 19:21.452
And I'll study
again after work.

19:21.577 --> 19:23.579
Yeah...

19:23.704 --> 19:25.123
(laughs)

19:25.247 --> 19:27.207
Those dimples are not going
to get you into Harvard.

19:27.333 --> 19:28.668
I think Mrs. Schwartz

19:28.793 --> 19:29.836
is going to give
us a pop quiz.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.337
I'm gonna study after work.

19:31.462 --> 19:32.505
I promise.

19:32.630 --> 19:33.714
I promise.

19:33.840 --> 19:35.466
I'm sorry. I promise.

19:35.591 --> 19:37.635
(laughs)

19:39.595 --> 19:40.763
Hey.

19:40.888 --> 19:41.806
Hi.

19:41.931 --> 19:43.599
Ethan, I'm freaking out.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.601
Naomi, now is not
a good time, okay?

19:45.726 --> 19:46.769
Why? What's going on?

19:46.894 --> 19:48.228
It's Steven.

19:48.354 --> 19:49.689
I told my mom that
I'm watching him

19:49.814 --> 19:51.398
so she could have
some time to herself

19:51.524 --> 19:52.608
and he's just
having a bad day.

19:52.733 --> 19:54.485
That's all right.
Let me help you.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.038
We have a new
cleaning service

20:05.163 --> 20:07.289
and I forgot to tell him
not to touch the furniture.

20:07.414 --> 20:08.833
He's been rearranging
it all afternoon.

20:08.958 --> 20:09.876
I've tried everything
that usually works

20:10.001 --> 20:11.711
to get him to change
his focus but nothing,

20:11.836 --> 20:13.253
and I really
need him to stop

20:13.379 --> 20:14.839
before my mom gets home.
Hey, it's all right.

20:14.964 --> 20:16.507
I'm here. Okay?

20:16.632 --> 20:18.217
I'll help.

20:19.426 --> 20:20.636
Hey, Steven.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.804
Hey, man. Naomi
came to see you.

20:21.929 --> 20:22.930
How cool is that, huh?

20:23.056 --> 20:24.431
The couch is in
the wrong place.

20:24.557 --> 20:25.850
Oh, I can see that.
You want me to help you out?

20:25.975 --> 20:26.976
No.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.268
I got it.

20:28.394 --> 20:29.645
Okay. Well, you know what?

20:29.770 --> 20:31.647
I was actually hoping
maybe we could

20:31.772 --> 20:33.482
pop some popcorn
and watch a movie.

20:33.607 --> 20:34.775
What do you think about that?

20:34.901 --> 20:36.736
I came all the way from
my house just for you.

20:36.861 --> 20:37.945
Oh, it sounds good, right?
You love popcorn.

20:38.071 --> 20:39.947
I like popcorn, with butter.

20:40.073 --> 20:41.741
A stick of butter,

20:41.866 --> 20:43.325
two teaspoons of salt

20:43.450 --> 20:44.577
and a pinch of pepper.

20:44.702 --> 20:46.328
That's perfect.
That's exactly how

20:46.453 --> 20:47.788
I like mine, but
we need the couch

20:47.914 --> 20:49.207
to sit on to watch
the movie, okay?

20:49.331 --> 20:51.834
So why don't you come with me
and we'll get some popcorn.

by the end of next week,

It's $500.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.850

might be a better way.

Did you like when your
parents got divorced?

whole lives fell apart.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.874

22:58.085 --> 22:59.920

just some slut.

23:01.255 --> 23:02.798

You need to go for the guy

The kids can play it,
but they can't arrange.

25:07.673 --> 25:09.049
Sure, sure. I would add
a little percussion

25:09.175 --> 25:10.759

25:14.430 --> 25:16.182

No.

water, and I don't want

they don't.

Oh, really?

27:24.268 --> 27:26.145
Why might that be?

27:26.270 --> 27:27.896
Because I love him.

27:28.021 --> 27:30.983
Oh, my God, I've heard enough!

27:34.403 --> 27:36.280
That's the address
to my beach house.

27:36.405 --> 27:39.199
Are you moving in there?

27:47.082 --> 27:48.000
MAN:
Your break's over
in five minutes, Dixon.

27:48.125 --> 27:50.043
I don't care about
the same stuff

27:50.169 --> 27:51.420
kids in Beverly
Hills care about.

27:51.545 --> 27:53.046
Hip nightclubs.

27:53.172 --> 27:55.341
Trendy purses.

27:55.466 --> 27:57.009
I just like doing
my own thing.

27:57.134 --> 28:01.221
So, you're trying not to fit in?

28:01.347 --> 28:02.931
I just like being different.

28:03.056 --> 28:05.725
It's how I'm made,
you know what I mean?

28:05.851 --> 28:06.935
Do I know what you mean?

28:07.060 --> 28:08.228
(chuckling)

28:08.354 --> 28:11.315
I'm a black kid living
with a white family.

28:11.440 --> 28:12.941
Doesn't get more
different than that.

28:13.066 --> 28:15.068
Right.

28:15.194 --> 28:16.570
Is that weird?

28:19.406 --> 28:22.368
You know, they're my family,
and I love them.

28:22.493 --> 28:23.869
They don't care
that I'm black.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.204
I don't care that
they're white.

28:25.329 --> 28:29.333
But, you know, sometimes, like,
when we're eating dinner

28:29.458 --> 28:32.169
or if we're talking about
something or even laughing,

28:32.294 --> 28:35.422
then just for a split second...

28:35.548 --> 28:37.049
I feel like I don't fit in.

28:38.342 --> 28:40.093
Then, just like that,
(snaps fingers)

28:40.219 --> 28:43.389
the feeling goes away, but...

28:43.514 --> 28:45.932
Somehow, it's still there.

28:46.058 --> 28:47.851
Yeah.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.939
So, when are you
gonna ask me out?

28:53.065 --> 28:54.483
(laughing)

28:54.608 --> 28:56.402
Maybe I don't want
to ask you out.

28:56.527 --> 28:58.987
Yeah, you do.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.030
Oh, you're so sure?

29:00.155 --> 29:02.199
Uh-huh... I bet you that you do.

29:02.324 --> 29:06.203
Wait... that means if I do ask
you out, then I'll lose the bet.

29:06.328 --> 29:08.080
Oh, there's no losers here.

29:08.205 --> 29:09.665
(laughing)

29:09.789 --> 29:11.083
All right, I like
the way you think.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.960
(giggling)

29:22.177 --> 29:23.970
Hey.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.139
Dad said you're
quitting the play.

29:26.265 --> 29:30.143
Oh, well, I couldn't work
under those conditions anymore.

29:30.269 --> 29:32.938
The acoustics in that auditorium
are atrocious.

29:33.063 --> 29:35.482
And the stage is
literally falling apart.

29:35.608 --> 29:38.860
Well... thank you so much

29:38.985 --> 29:40.362
for all your help.

29:40.487 --> 29:42.322
You're welcome, darling.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.157
You're in good hands

29:44.283 --> 29:45.992
with Brenda.

29:46.118 --> 29:47.953
Mm.

29:48.078 --> 29:49.955
Annie?

29:50.080 --> 29:52.040
You are doing a wonderful job
in the musical.

29:52.165 --> 29:53.917
You are

29:54.042 --> 29:55.335
very talented.

29:55.461 --> 29:58.255
Thank you, Grandma.

30:06.305 --> 30:08.307
Mom.
Mm-hmm?

30:08.432 --> 30:10.267
I went to see Gail.

30:10.392 --> 30:12.811
I talked to her.

30:15.063 --> 30:16.440
Why would you do that?

30:16.565 --> 30:18.567
Because I want her
out of our lives.

30:18.692 --> 30:21.027
You have no business
getting involved.

30:21.153 --> 30:24.156
Mom, it's not just
a casual fling with her and Dad.

30:24.281 --> 30:26.116
He's moving her
into the beach house.

30:26.241 --> 30:28.285
Dad lied.

30:30.996 --> 30:32.539
What?

30:33.582 --> 30:35.501
Mom...

30:35.626 --> 30:38.170
No.

30:38.295 --> 30:40.506
I'm sorry.

30:41.548 --> 30:43.550

Okay.

32:26.528 --> 32:28.238
What's the matter?

32:28.363 --> 32:29.865
(sighs)

32:29.989 --> 32:32.200
Look, I don't know
what the story is

32:32.325 --> 32:34.327
with you and Sammy's dad.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.372
It just feels like
there's unfinished business.

32:37.497 --> 32:40.333
And what would give you
that idea?

32:40.459 --> 32:43.336
Well, I was talking
to Brenda, and...

32:43.462 --> 32:45.923
Wait, wait-- you were talking
to Brenda about me?

32:46.047 --> 32:49.301
I'm just trying
to get to know you.

32:49.426 --> 32:52.805
Look, Kelly, I just want you
to feel like you can talk me,

32:52.930 --> 32:54.765
you know, like you
can tell me anything,

32:54.890 --> 32:56.433
and if there is
something going on

32:56.558 --> 32:58.017
with you and
your ex, then...

32:58.143 --> 32:59.394
I'm a big boy...

32:59.519 --> 33:00.687
I can handle it.

33:05.651 --> 33:08.862
There's nothing going on
with me and my ex.

33:14.576 --> 33:16.077
KELLY:
Brenda.

33:16.202 --> 33:16.829
Hey.

33:16.954 --> 33:19.372
Uh, what did you
say to Ryan?

33:19.498 --> 33:20.332
About what?
About me.

33:20.457 --> 33:22.083
Not much.

33:22.208 --> 33:24.043
You shouldn't have
said anything.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.796
Okay, Kelly,
any guy that dates you

33:25.921 --> 33:27.046
is gonna have
questions about him.

33:27.172 --> 33:28.590
You should just get
your story straight.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.843
My story is straight.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.636
You know,
you get really emotional

33:32.761 --> 33:34.053
when you talk about this.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.555
I wonder why that is.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.182
What are you saying?

33:37.307 --> 33:38.809
I'm saying that
you still have feelings for him.

33:38.934 --> 33:40.226
Of course I still have feelings

33:40.352 --> 33:41.687
for him--
he's my son's father.

33:41.812 --> 33:43.355
Kelly, come on,
you know there's more

33:43.480 --> 33:45.148
to it than that.
No, there isn't.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.942
Because it can't be;
because he's not here,

33:47.066 --> 33:48.568
and I deserve
to be with somebody

33:48.694 --> 33:50.445
and be happy.
Oh, give me a break.

33:50.570 --> 33:52.572
You are never gonna be happy
with somebody else,

33:52.698 --> 33:54.908
because you're still in love
with Dylan, and you know it.

34:06.378 --> 34:07.170
(knocking)

34:15.303 --> 34:17.096
Dad, what are you doing here?

34:17.222 --> 34:20.308
Hear they have great coffee.

34:20.433 --> 34:22.601
Well, you came
to the right spot.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.145
Mr. Matthews told me that you

34:24.270 --> 34:27.524
got an incomplete
on the test you took today.

34:27.649 --> 34:28.775
I'll make it up.

34:28.900 --> 34:31.194
Look, Dixon, I like
that you have this job,

34:31.319 --> 34:32.987
but I told you I didn't want it

34:33.112 --> 34:34.322
to interfere
with your schoolwork.

34:34.447 --> 34:36.658
Dad, look, I-I need
this job right now, you know?

34:36.783 --> 34:37.784
After next week, you know,

34:37.909 --> 34:39.369
I'll cut down
on a few shifts, but...

34:39.494 --> 34:40.786
Why next week?

34:42.330 --> 34:43.498
Um...

34:43.623 --> 34:46.752
Because I, uh...

34:46.877 --> 34:48.003
accidentally

34:48.127 --> 34:49.337
knocked off
someone's side mirror

34:49.462 --> 34:50.630
when I was parking the van

34:50.755 --> 34:52.632
and wanted to pay
for it myself.

34:52.757 --> 34:53.507
You should've come to me.

34:53.632 --> 34:56.719
But, Dad...

34:56.844 --> 34:58.388
your insurance
would've went up, right?

34:58.513 --> 35:01.892
And I heard you and Mom
talking about money problems.

35:02.017 --> 35:04.102
So I wanted to take
care of this myself.

35:06.563 --> 35:08.774
I don't know many other kids
who would've gotten a job.

35:08.899 --> 35:10.776
I mean, hell, I never did.

35:10.901 --> 35:12.652
You're already
ahead of me.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.404
Look, uh, I'll-I'll

35:14.529 --> 35:16.698
pay for it now,
and you can pay me back in time.

35:16.823 --> 35:17.699
How's that sound?

35:17.824 --> 35:20.493
Thanks, Dad.

35:20.619 --> 35:22.495
Leave a tip.

35:22.621 --> 35:25.916
I got your tip:
don't get any more bad grades.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.923
REPORTER (on TV):
...is in critical
but stable condition--

35:33.048 --> 35:34.716
normal after such an operation.

35:34.841 --> 35:36.551
Her condition will be monitored

35:36.676 --> 35:39.846
for 72 hours to see if there's
any sign of organ rejection.

35:39.972 --> 35:40.764
(Naomi and Ethan
laughing on computer)

35:40.889 --> 35:42.307
NAOMI:
Do you like it?

35:42.432 --> 35:43.725
ETHAN:
Oh, I love it.

35:43.850 --> 35:44.893
I think I'm gonna
wear it to school.

35:45.018 --> 35:45.894
Oh, you would not.
I dare you.

35:46.019 --> 35:47.562
Come on, get
into the video.

35:47.687 --> 35:48.563
All right, all
right, all right.

35:48.688 --> 35:49.898
(laughter)

35:50.023 --> 35:51.566
You look pretty good
with a monkey on your head.

35:51.691 --> 35:53.568
Oh, yeah? Well, you look good
with a tiger on your head.

35:53.693 --> 35:54.694
Thank you, thank you.
(playful growling)

35:54.820 --> 35:55.779

the best day ever.

35:55.904 --> 35:57.697
I love you,
Ethan Ward.

35:57.823 --> 35:59.699
I love you.

36:00.951 --> 36:03.703
(Naomi laughing)
ETHAN: You're not cotton candy.

36:09.042 --> 36:10.168
Yo, Dix.

36:11.878 --> 36:13.588
Hey.

36:13.713 --> 36:15.340
Here.

36:15.465 --> 36:16.758
Thanks for
helping me out, man.

36:16.883 --> 36:17.759
Hey.

36:17.884 --> 36:19.344
No worries.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.847
So, listen, my dad has a
hookup with the Lakers.

36:21.972 --> 36:24.683
We got courtside tickets,
but my buddy bailed on me.

36:24.808 --> 36:25.725
So you interested?

36:25.851 --> 36:26.810
For real?
Yeah.

36:26.935 --> 36:28.603
Kobe?

36:28.728 --> 36:30.605
Hell, yeah, I want
to see the Lakers, man!

36:30.730 --> 36:32.315
(laughs)

36:34.609 --> 36:36.736
You hit that guy's car,
almost got him in trouble,

36:36.862 --> 36:38.655
and then he asks
you to a game?

36:38.780 --> 36:40.198
It's nothing.
I've seen guys fistfight,

36:40.323 --> 36:41.867
and then five minutes later,
they're hanging out.

36:41.992 --> 36:43.409
(laughs)
That's crazy.

36:43.535 --> 36:45.328
Yeah, you know,
guys aren't like girls.

36:45.453 --> 36:46.746
We don't hold grudges.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.748
Life is way too short.

36:56.756 --> 36:57.757
Hey.

36:59.592 --> 37:01.928
Look...

37:02.054 --> 37:03.889
I'm not gonna post anything
on my blog about you.

37:05.932 --> 37:07.433
Okay.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.476
Thank you.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.645
Just thought
you should know.

37:10.770 --> 37:12.397
Okay.

37:12.522 --> 37:14.774
So see you around?

37:14.900 --> 37:16.442
Yeah.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.777
See you.

37:27.620 --> 37:29.497
All right, man,
so I'll just catch you later.
Hey.

37:29.622 --> 37:31.583
What's this?

37:31.708 --> 37:32.584
Snickerdoodles.

37:32.709 --> 37:33.877
They're apology
cookies.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.921
When I do something
screwed up, I bake.

37:36.046 --> 37:37.463
Uh, you know,
just forget about it.

37:37.589 --> 37:38.715
I can't forget about it.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.383
I'm an idiot, Ty.

37:40.508 --> 37:41.384
I like you.

37:41.509 --> 37:43.011
I want to hang
out with you.

37:43.136 --> 37:44.679
Well, you really haven't
been acting like it.
I know.

37:44.804 --> 37:46.139
I know I messed up.

37:46.264 --> 37:49.809
And-and I am so hoping
that I'm not too late to fix it.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.853
Am I too late?

37:51.978 --> 37:54.231
Look, I-I spent the whole night
making you these cookies.

37:54.355 --> 37:55.440
So eat a snickerdoodle;
they're really good.

37:55.565 --> 37:57.025
I really don't think cookies
are gonna do it.

37:57.150 --> 37:58.610
You haven't
tasted one yet.

37:58.735 --> 38:00.486
Annie, I don't have to.
I just...

38:09.913 --> 38:12.040
Wow.

38:12.165 --> 38:13.666
That's way better
than cookies.

38:13.792 --> 38:14.751
(chuckles)

38:14.876 --> 38:15.794
(chuckles)

38:15.919 --> 38:18.213
I'm sorry. Really.

38:18.337 --> 38:20.381
You know, if you weren't
so freakin' adorable,

38:20.506 --> 38:21.967
(laughs)
I wouldn't even be having

38:22.092 --> 38:24.427
this conversation
right now.

38:24.552 --> 38:25.511
Can we start over?

38:25.637 --> 38:26.888
Okay.

38:27.013 --> 38:28.223
Yeah.

38:28.347 --> 38:29.724
So you want to go out
this weekend?

38:29.849 --> 38:32.769
Yes, I would.

38:32.894 --> 38:33.937
Good.

38:42.487 --> 38:43.571
(laughs)

38:43.696 --> 38:44.864
(laughs)

38:44.990 --> 38:46.032
I remember
that hat.

38:46.158 --> 38:46.783
L.A. Zoo.

38:46.908 --> 38:48.910
Still cute.

38:49.035 --> 38:50.829
How you doing?

38:50.954 --> 38:53.748
I'm all right.

38:56.042 --> 38:58.670
I realized, can't always
get what I want.

38:58.795 --> 39:00.005
(chuckles)

39:00.130 --> 39:02.674
No matter how bad I want it.

39:02.799 --> 39:05.051
Can't fix my parents' marriage.

39:05.177 --> 39:06.678
Can't make my dad love my mom.

39:06.803 --> 39:08.346
I'm sorry.

39:08.471 --> 39:12.475
You've been wonderful
through all this craziness.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.686
Thank you.

39:14.811 --> 39:16.896
Think we can start over?

39:17.022 --> 39:18.648
What do you mean?

39:18.773 --> 39:19.941
(sighs)
All I know

39:20.066 --> 39:22.819
is I miss those two people
who went to the zoo

39:22.944 --> 39:25.697
and ate cotton candy and were
silly and happy together.

39:25.822 --> 39:26.823
(chuckles)

39:28.908 --> 39:31.494
So you saying...

39:31.619 --> 39:32.996
you want to get back together?

39:33.121 --> 39:34.789
I'm saying

39:34.914 --> 39:37.542
take it day by day,
see what happens.

39:38.835 --> 39:40.461
I can do that.

39:44.007 --> 39:44.883
Come here.

39:45.008 --> 39:48.011
(both laugh)

39:48.136 --> 39:49.762
So cute.
Yeah? Still cute?

39:49.888 --> 39:50.722
Still cute.

39:50.847 --> 39:51.890
(laughs)
