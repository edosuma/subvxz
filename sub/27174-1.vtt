WEBVTT

00:11.097 --> 00:11.945
- All right, Happy!

00:12.353 --> 00:13.350
Bring it home!

00:13.350 --> 00:14.493
- Hit him, hit him!

00:14.493 --> 00:15.576
Get in there!

00:18.086 --> 00:19.206
- Come on, Happy!

00:19.206 --> 00:20.326
- Come on!

00:20.326 --> 00:21.576
Come on, Happy!

00:24.415 --> 00:25.313
- Happy!

00:25.313 --> 00:26.358
- Stop messing around!

00:26.358 --> 00:27.191
- He's got this.

00:27.191 --> 00:29.460
- Stop messing around out there!

00:29.460 --> 00:31.583
Nobody can touch Happy McBride!

00:31.583 --> 00:32.490
Nobody!

00:32.490 --> 00:33.672
Nobody will!

00:34.725 --> 00:39.725
- That's another
knockout win for Happy McBride.

00:50.480 --> 00:51.670
- Jab him one.

00:52.095 --> 00:53.140
Use your left.

00:53.140 --> 00:55.140
Stick him when he clowns.

00:55.140 --> 00:55.990
Wait for it.

00:55.990 --> 00:57.290
Wait for it!

01:11.212 --> 01:12.045
Do it!

01:12.045 --> 01:13.107
Do it!

01:13.107 --> 01:13.940
Do it!

01:15.120 --> 01:16.170
Owen, move your head.

01:21.010 --> 01:22.760
Left, use your left.

01:23.227 --> 01:24.186
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:24.186 --> 01:25.436
It's you, Owen.

01:26.560 --> 01:28.813
Damn it, Owen, you've got
to stop the take down!

01:31.593 --> 01:33.572
- Happy, you gonna help me out

01:33.572 --> 01:34.972
or are you just gonna watch?

01:36.040 --> 01:37.220
- I can't take my eyes off you.

01:37.220 --> 01:38.640
It's like watching a train wreck.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.363
- Take him to the ground!

01:41.320 --> 01:43.015
Drop the left!

01:43.848 --> 01:44.848
There it is.

01:47.050 --> 01:48.703
You guys ain't done, get up.

01:50.230 --> 01:51.085
- You know, you're right, you know?

01:51.085 --> 01:53.613
The only chance that guy
had was on the floor.

01:54.570 --> 01:56.820
Even with the size advantage.

01:56.820 --> 01:57.653
- Owner's over there, man.

01:57.653 --> 01:59.310
- I didn't come to see him.

01:59.310 --> 02:00.610
You're Happy McBride, man.

02:01.940 --> 02:02.840
- No, I'm not.

02:02.840 --> 02:03.860
Happy McBride is taller

02:03.860 --> 02:05.853
and apparently a lot smarter than me.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.620
I can't help you, kid, okay?

02:08.620 --> 02:09.627
I don't have the time.

02:09.627 --> 02:11.628
- Okay, well if you'll just take a look.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.600
I made this reel for you.

02:13.600 --> 02:15.650
It's short because I
know you must be busy,

02:15.650 --> 02:16.483
superstar and all.

02:16.483 --> 02:18.272
- You came here for me?

02:18.272 --> 02:19.105
- Yeah.

02:19.105 --> 02:20.070
- From where?

02:20.070 --> 02:21.670
- From New York.

02:21.670 --> 02:24.303
Internet has you working out
at this gym, so I came here.

02:26.320 --> 02:28.350
It's small stuff, I know.

02:28.350 --> 02:31.610
But six and 0, I'm undefeated.

02:31.610 --> 02:33.164
Kinda like you.

02:33.164 --> 02:33.997
- Oh, next big thing, huh?

02:33.997 --> 02:35.270
- Not like you, you know,

02:35.270 --> 02:38.180
but most of the write-ups
said that I had promise.

02:38.180 --> 02:39.150
Time to go pro though.

02:39.150 --> 02:41.630
I mean, the average time a guy
starts picking up injuries,

02:41.630 --> 02:44.549
is what, approximately eight fights?

02:44.549 --> 02:45.870
- You got that down to a science?

02:45.870 --> 02:47.123
- Closing time, lights out!

02:47.123 --> 02:49.060
You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here.

02:49.060 --> 02:51.950
- This shouldn't be any different
than any other business.

02:51.950 --> 02:52.783
Should it?

02:52.783 --> 02:53.860
- It is.

02:53.860 --> 02:55.647
You don't talk like any fighter I know.

02:55.647 --> 02:57.830
Did you go to a good school?

02:57.830 --> 02:59.450
- Yeah, a few years in college

02:59.450 --> 03:01.340
and private school before
that, but nothing special.

03:01.340 --> 03:03.913
- You should go back, okay?

03:05.480 --> 03:07.267
Everybody and their brother's
trying to get into this now.

03:07.267 --> 03:08.890
You can't get in.

03:08.890 --> 03:10.460
You gotta be connected,
you gotta have money.

03:10.460 --> 03:11.789
- I have money.

03:11.789 --> 03:13.789
I have 1,700 bucks, thank you very much.

03:15.230 --> 03:19.010
- Well, that's barely enough
to get a foot in the door.

03:19.010 --> 03:21.520
- Okay, well you know
which door to put it in.

03:21.520 --> 03:23.193
- You're not giving up, are you?

03:24.260 --> 03:25.093
All right, listen.

03:25.093 --> 03:26.930
I got a ride coming, but
let's see you throw a few.

03:26.930 --> 03:28.180
- All right, against you?

03:29.420 --> 03:30.636
- As if.

03:30.636 --> 03:32.160
Al!

03:32.160 --> 03:34.777
Hundred bucks in it for you
if you knock this guy out.

03:37.470 --> 03:39.063
- Does he have the hundred?

03:41.130 --> 03:42.420
- He has the hundred.

03:43.450 --> 03:44.593
Go to it, boys.

03:45.530 --> 03:46.723
Whenever you're ready, Al.

03:46.723 --> 03:47.556
I got your green.

03:47.556 --> 03:48.389
- What do you think of my two-three?

03:48.389 --> 03:50.061
I've been working on it.

03:50.061 --> 03:51.561
- Show me.

03:54.280 --> 03:56.290
- Your boy's got some D, huh?

03:56.290 --> 03:57.340
Slippin' and dippin'?

04:12.200 --> 04:13.040
- Finish this.

04:14.816 --> 04:15.649
- Fuck!

04:18.721 --> 04:19.642
- It's okay.

04:19.642 --> 04:21.322
Just breathe.

04:21.322 --> 04:23.133
- Did you do that on purpose?

04:24.102 --> 04:26.070
- The liver is nine ribs down.

04:26.070 --> 04:29.830
It's center of circulation
so all the blood flows there.

04:29.830 --> 04:31.290
- You win, I get half.

04:31.290 --> 04:33.080
- Yeah, seems a little steep.

04:33.080 --> 04:35.570
- Plus, you pay expenses.

04:35.570 --> 04:36.723
I get you one fight.

04:38.110 --> 04:40.130
- Name's Matthew Bradford.

04:40.130 --> 04:42.260
- The funds, Matthew Bradford.

04:42.260 --> 04:43.710
- Oh, now?

04:43.710 --> 04:45.030
- Yeah, I can't put myself out there

04:45.030 --> 04:47.310
and then find out you
don't have it anymore.

04:47.310 --> 04:48.160
I don't know you.

04:49.150 --> 04:51.340
- Well, I don't know you either.

04:51.340 --> 04:52.190
- Well, who am I?

04:53.160 --> 04:54.980
- You know I know.

04:54.980 --> 04:56.800
- Who am I, Al?

04:56.800 --> 04:59.450
- Undisputed heavyweight champ.

04:59.450 --> 05:00.570
- You know me.

05:00.570 --> 05:01.403
What's it gonna be?

05:01.403 --> 05:02.236
I got a ride waiting.

05:04.910 --> 05:07.030
Okay, five o'clock tomorrow.

05:07.030 --> 05:07.950
- Early start.

05:07.950 --> 05:08.783
Here?

05:11.200 --> 05:12.033
- Here.

05:16.211 --> 05:17.310
Hey, honey.

05:17.310 --> 05:18.143
- Hey, Dad.

05:18.143 --> 05:19.480
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

05:19.480 --> 05:20.313
I'll drive.

05:20.313 --> 05:21.146
- Oh, come on.

05:21.146 --> 05:21.979
That's not gonna happen again.

05:23.148 --> 05:24.770
- I've got some much to live for, honey.

05:24.770 --> 05:25.670
- No trust?

05:29.947 --> 05:30.780
- Ah.

05:32.187 --> 05:34.196
- Another fighter?

05:34.196 --> 05:35.450
- More of the same.

05:35.450 --> 05:36.860
- I thought you were
going to do your own thing

05:36.860 --> 05:38.043
after this last one.

05:41.090 --> 05:42.203
I'm fine, Dad.

05:42.203 --> 05:44.663
- How do you
say, I'm fine, in French?

05:51.953 --> 05:53.740
- Oh, my God.

05:53.740 --> 05:55.796
That's a lot of French.

06:06.860 --> 06:07.693
Hey.

06:08.707 --> 06:09.543
There he is.

06:10.530 --> 06:12.313
- You're a little late.

06:13.910 --> 06:14.743
- Yeah, well.

06:14.743 --> 06:16.240
I'm sorry about that.

06:16.240 --> 06:17.163
Business is good.

06:18.091 --> 06:20.190
What do you got going here?

06:20.190 --> 06:21.740
- Everything I need in
there except a shower,

06:21.740 --> 06:24.113
but gym membership for that, so.

06:25.970 --> 06:27.810
- What's with that poster?

06:27.810 --> 06:29.710
- Oh, that's pre-med.

06:29.710 --> 06:31.143
- Pre-med?

06:32.560 --> 06:33.630
Liver.

06:33.630 --> 06:34.463
- Right.

06:34.463 --> 06:35.460
- Yeah.

06:35.460 --> 06:36.293
You ready?

06:36.293 --> 06:37.126
- Mm-hmm.

06:37.126 --> 06:38.160
- All right, let's do it.

06:39.916 --> 06:41.160
- I was a little confused at first.

06:41.160 --> 06:42.930
I thought we were going
to a gym or something.

06:42.930 --> 06:44.130
- A gym, why a gym?

06:44.130 --> 06:44.970
- Well, to train.

06:44.970 --> 06:47.250
I mean, you're gonna
be my manager and all.

06:47.250 --> 06:48.390
- No, no, no, no.

06:48.390 --> 06:49.280
Don't even say that out loud.

06:49.280 --> 06:51.251
I'm nobody's manager, man.

06:51.251 --> 06:52.550
I don't just put my own thing aside

06:52.550 --> 06:53.800
and get a few guys going.

06:54.817 --> 06:56.410
Hey!

06:56.410 --> 06:57.610
- What's your own thing?

06:59.081 --> 07:00.780
- Are you kidding me with that?

07:00.780 --> 07:01.613
- What?

07:01.613 --> 07:02.446
You're fighting again?

07:02.446 --> 07:03.720
- Must be happy hour, huh?

07:03.720 --> 07:04.553
- Yeah.

07:04.553 --> 07:06.340
- Always happy
hour when you're here.

07:06.340 --> 07:07.640
- I thought you'd retired.

07:08.890 --> 07:10.810
- Why would you think that?

07:10.810 --> 07:12.403
- It's been like eight years.

07:13.290 --> 07:14.800
- The hell it has.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.240
- Well, you won your
last one when I was 10.

07:18.240 --> 07:19.830
It was actually my 10th birthday

07:19.830 --> 07:21.333
and I just turned 18.

07:24.420 --> 07:25.253
- Okay.

07:26.470 --> 07:28.570
- I didn't mean anything by that.

07:28.570 --> 07:29.873
I mean, you look like
you could fight today.

07:29.873 --> 07:32.640
It's just been so long that, you know.

07:32.640 --> 07:33.473
- Enough.

07:35.740 --> 07:37.343
Bring up that stuff on the internet.

07:48.170 --> 07:49.686
What is this?

07:49.686 --> 07:51.630
I'm talking about your fight footage.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.593
- It's the stuff we were
talking about earlier.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.601
- Where are you going?

08:01.601 --> 08:02.777
When are you coming home?

08:02.777 --> 08:04.507
What about us?

08:04.507 --> 08:05.840
- Turn that off.

08:08.150 --> 08:09.573
- Okay, I'll get the reel.

08:10.770 --> 08:12.240
- How does it get on there?

08:12.240 --> 08:14.790
- It must've been on TV or
something, I don't know.

08:16.600 --> 08:18.250
- Oh, there he is, right on time.

08:20.070 --> 08:21.880
Guy puts on fights.

08:21.880 --> 08:24.230
Unsanctioned, but he
draws a good audience, so.

08:51.474 --> 08:53.230
He's got one tonight.

08:53.230 --> 08:54.630
You're the opener.

08:54.630 --> 08:55.610
- What?

08:55.610 --> 08:56.443
Really?

08:56.443 --> 08:57.520
Just like that?

08:57.520 --> 08:58.353
This is great.

08:58.353 --> 08:59.990
I mean, I just came here two days ago.

08:59.990 --> 09:02.930
- Bet you wish your dad
could see you now, huh?

09:02.930 --> 09:04.000
- What does that mean?

09:04.000 --> 09:04.833
- Well, he couldn't have been too happy

09:04.833 --> 09:07.720
about you giving up school
to get punched in the face.

09:07.720 --> 09:10.290
- Can we talk about
something else, please?

09:11.430 --> 09:12.810
- We could talk about why my picture's

09:12.810 --> 09:14.880
not up on the wall anymore.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.482
- People keep stealing them, Happy.

09:16.482 --> 09:18.202
- Yeah.

09:25.010 --> 09:26.303
- So who am I fighting?

09:26.303 --> 09:27.697
- I don't see him,

09:28.726 --> 09:31.333
but I do see a lot of people
here who mean something.

09:32.580 --> 09:34.243
- I heard about this kind of thing before.

09:37.340 --> 09:38.680
- There he is.

09:38.680 --> 09:39.513
- Ah.

09:40.650 --> 09:41.483
What's up, Hap?

09:41.483 --> 09:44.193
- Is he not your guy, too?

09:46.847 --> 09:48.310
- I told you.

09:48.310 --> 09:49.460
None of you are my guy.

09:50.393 --> 09:51.226
Huh?

09:54.453 --> 09:57.273
- What's up, Happity Hap?

09:57.273 --> 09:59.083
What's going on, baby?

09:59.083 --> 10:00.353
- Over my left shoulder.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.770
- Seriously?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.290
- Listen to me.

10:04.290 --> 10:06.760
You do not go toe to toe with this guy.

10:06.760 --> 10:08.570
This guy will pick you apart.

10:08.570 --> 10:10.010
Do not fight that guy standing.

10:10.010 --> 10:10.843
Look at me.

10:10.843 --> 10:12.615
Take him to the ground, okay?

10:13.675 --> 10:14.990
- Are you kidding me right now?

10:14.990 --> 10:15.990
- Take him to the ground.

10:15.990 --> 10:16.823
- Man, I'm not worried about this guy.

10:16.823 --> 10:19.420
- Take him to the ground,
take him to the ground.

10:19.420 --> 10:20.253
I'm telling you.

10:20.253 --> 10:21.130
Are you listening?

10:21.130 --> 10:22.470
- Better not be my big fight.

10:22.470 --> 10:24.190
- Take him to the ground.

10:28.747 --> 10:30.980
Do not let you take him to
the ground, whatever you do.

10:30.980 --> 10:33.080
You stay on your feet, you pick him apart.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.323
- You're managing both
of us in the same fight?

10:36.597 --> 10:37.690
- I promised him a little help.

10:37.690 --> 10:39.290
Two birds, one stone.

10:39.290 --> 10:41.543
- Shouldn't the birds be
in the same weight class?

10:42.650 --> 10:43.955
- Unsanctioned.

10:46.015 --> 10:48.423
- Welcome to another
fight night at Victor's.

10:51.170 --> 10:54.043
Ultra violent mixed martial arts.

10:55.746 --> 10:56.579
All right.

10:56.579 --> 10:57.970
I'm gonna lay down some
rules for you guys.

10:57.970 --> 10:59.960
I want you to listen very close.

10:59.960 --> 11:01.233
No biting.

11:02.500 --> 11:04.920
No strikes to the spine.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.550
Let's go to what does go

11:07.550 --> 11:09.630
and that is everything else.

11:12.870 --> 11:14.980
- This one's a stare down.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.863
Don't ever think I saw Cray Cray smile.

11:16.863 --> 11:18.383
- Ready?

11:18.383 --> 11:19.873
Fight!

11:25.307 --> 11:26.627
- That's the right idea.

11:26.627 --> 11:28.210
Grab him this time.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.756
- What're you waiting for?

11:46.756 --> 11:48.423
Cray, to the ground!

11:49.533 --> 11:50.473
Get ready to stuff him!

11:50.473 --> 11:51.306
You know what's coming!

11:51.306 --> 11:52.771
Stuff him!

11:52.771 --> 11:54.155
Deliver it, Matt!

11:56.325 --> 11:57.158
That's it, Matt.

11:57.158 --> 11:58.516
Same thing.

11:58.516 --> 12:01.526
- You guys really think
this fool can take me?

12:01.526 --> 12:03.251
He couldn't hit me with a baseball--

12:04.816 --> 12:05.761
- We're gonna keep clowning around

12:05.761 --> 12:07.762
until he hurts you!

12:07.762 --> 12:09.679
Take him to the ground!

12:19.004 --> 12:20.584
Don't let him take you to the ground!

12:27.100 --> 12:28.130
Matt, twist your hips!

12:28.130 --> 12:29.053
Slip out!

12:30.310 --> 12:31.620
Tighter!

12:31.620 --> 12:32.723
Matt, twist out!

12:33.598 --> 12:34.747
That's good work, Cray.

12:36.918 --> 12:38.118
That's it.

12:45.678 --> 12:47.361
- Yeah!

13:03.067 --> 13:03.900
- Ow.

13:07.799 --> 13:09.290
Yeah, I need to speak to Happy.

13:09.290 --> 13:10.604
- How many
times do I gotta tell you?

13:10.604 --> 13:11.737
Who is this, Bobby again?

13:11.737 --> 13:14.120
Listen, I never know when
he's gonna be here, all right?

13:14.120 --> 13:15.130
Stop calling!

13:15.130 --> 13:16.220
- It's not Bobby.

13:16.220 --> 13:18.089
I wanna leave a message
for when Happy McBride--

13:19.230 --> 13:20.143
Hello, hello?

13:22.100 --> 13:24.510
- License and registration, son.

13:24.510 --> 13:25.723
- Didn't I see you at the Gulag?

13:25.723 --> 13:26.810
- Yes, you did.

13:26.810 --> 13:28.300
I'm hard to miss.

13:28.300 --> 13:30.120
- I'm looking for Happy.

13:30.120 --> 13:31.220
- So is a lot of guys.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.950
How much did he get you for?

13:33.950 --> 13:35.100
- All of it.

13:35.100 --> 13:35.933
- All of it.

13:36.870 --> 13:37.703
Well.

13:39.920 --> 13:40.790
You didn't hear it from me,

13:40.790 --> 13:43.160
but he's never very far from his daughter.

13:43.160 --> 13:45.823
There's a little diner
called Cadillac Jack's,

13:47.020 --> 13:48.800
that's where she works.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.593
It's Saturday, big tip day.

13:51.700 --> 13:54.600
He's gonna be there taking her tips

13:54.600 --> 13:56.660
because that's what he does.

13:56.660 --> 13:58.560
That's what Happy does.

13:58.560 --> 13:59.570
He takes.

13:59.570 --> 14:03.230
He just takes and takes
'cause he's a bad guy.

14:03.230 --> 14:04.200
He's scum.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.670
He's gonna pretend to be your friend

14:05.670 --> 14:07.750
and then he's gonna gut you.

14:07.750 --> 14:09.043
Do you understand that?

14:09.043 --> 14:10.410
- Just get out of here, man.

14:10.410 --> 14:11.800
- Cadillac Jack's.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.636
Pop your head in there,
you might find him.

14:14.636 --> 14:17.674
You've got the van, you
might as well kill him.

14:39.900 --> 14:41.200
- Can I get you something?

14:42.713 --> 14:44.423
- Only if my friend shows up.

14:56.970 --> 14:58.500
- Want this while you wait?

14:59.930 --> 15:02.430
- I actually don't have
any money to pay for this.

15:06.010 --> 15:06.843
- I know.

15:06.843 --> 15:08.160
- I'm not a bum or anything.

15:08.160 --> 15:10.900
I just got robbed.

15:10.900 --> 15:12.520
Not the usual way, but still.

15:12.520 --> 15:13.523
- Sorry to hear it.

15:27.853 --> 15:29.770
- Was that French, too?

15:30.670 --> 15:32.200
How many languages do you speak?

15:32.200 --> 15:33.033
- Enough.

15:33.033 --> 15:35.490
But what I really wanna
do is become a fighter.

15:36.323 --> 15:37.756
- A fighter, huh?

15:37.756 --> 15:38.589
Why is that?

15:38.589 --> 15:40.650
- Money, fame, chicks.

15:40.650 --> 15:42.810
- So, what's stopping you from doing it

15:42.810 --> 15:45.590
besides knowing how to punch?

15:45.590 --> 15:46.890
- Oh, I know how to punch.

15:50.750 --> 15:51.673
Oh, come on.

16:01.010 --> 16:02.360
- How'd you know what I do?

16:03.310 --> 16:04.860
- Wasn't the way you talk.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.193
- Yeah, so I've heard.

16:07.380 --> 16:10.080
You don't really talk
like anyone else either.

16:10.080 --> 16:12.713
That accent from all the
languages you speak or?

16:15.777 --> 16:16.940
- I spent some time in Montreal

16:16.940 --> 16:18.806
when I was younger with my mom.

16:18.806 --> 16:19.639
- Nice.

16:20.750 --> 16:21.583
Seriously, though.

16:21.583 --> 16:22.570
How'd you know I fight?

16:24.620 --> 16:26.210
- I don't know.

16:26.210 --> 16:27.710
It's this feeling you give me.

16:28.630 --> 16:29.463
- Thanks.

16:29.463 --> 16:31.250
- Didn't say that was a good thing though.

17:03.510 --> 17:05.170
- But I could get two of these pair

17:05.170 --> 17:07.020
for the price of one of these pair.

17:07.020 --> 17:09.262
- I mean, it comes down to
how superstitious you are.

17:12.829 --> 17:13.833
Oh, there you go.

17:18.170 --> 17:19.002
- He's the man.

17:20.829 --> 17:22.920
- Hey, thank God for small favors.

17:22.920 --> 17:24.252
I thought you were dead.

17:25.550 --> 17:29.110
- So, you left me in a parking lot.

17:29.110 --> 17:30.970
- You didn't pay enough for a funeral.

17:30.970 --> 17:32.243
- You gonna ask me in?

17:33.996 --> 17:34.829
- Well.

17:37.640 --> 17:41.200
I will ask you what you're doing here

17:41.200 --> 17:42.700
and who told you where I live.

17:47.243 --> 17:50.269
- I paid you enough
money to get a decent fight.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.820
- And what would you call what you got?

17:51.820 --> 17:53.800
- Well, we both know the truth about that,

17:53.800 --> 17:55.750
so I'm gonna need my money back.

17:55.750 --> 17:56.583
- Whoa.

18:00.090 --> 18:02.530
- Well, you can wither
give me my money back

18:02.530 --> 18:04.890
or you can get me another fight.

18:04.890 --> 18:06.900
- You want another fight,
pay for another fight.

18:06.900 --> 18:08.720
- It took six fights to get that money.

18:08.720 --> 18:10.370
- Well, fight six more times.

18:10.370 --> 18:12.163
- I'd rather you do the right thing.

18:13.150 --> 18:14.813
I'm not leaving here until you do.

18:16.574 --> 18:17.407
- You just left.

18:45.896 --> 18:46.729
I'm up!

19:06.640 --> 19:09.480
- Happy, you've
had the next world champ

19:09.480 --> 19:11.630
three times in the last year.

19:11.630 --> 19:12.463
- I know, I know.

19:12.463 --> 19:14.423
I'm almost embarrassed to be here.

19:16.458 --> 19:18.793
But Benny, with this one,

19:19.980 --> 19:23.305
I don't want you saying that
I didn't tell you about him.

19:23.305 --> 19:24.138
All right?

19:25.170 --> 19:26.340
Have a good day, bud.

19:26.340 --> 19:27.173
- Wait, that's it?

19:27.173 --> 19:28.083
Just like that?

19:29.240 --> 19:30.740
- Yeah.

19:30.740 --> 19:31.970
Look, this is the one I'm throwing you

19:31.970 --> 19:33.740
in appreciation for those other bums.

19:33.740 --> 19:35.950
- Oh, this is that one?

19:35.950 --> 19:36.783
- Yeah.

19:36.783 --> 19:38.450
- But you're not pitching him?

19:38.450 --> 19:39.283
- Thanks for your time, brother.

19:39.283 --> 19:40.116
See you, bud.

19:45.485 --> 19:46.670
You need his name.

19:46.670 --> 19:47.503
- That would help.

19:47.503 --> 19:50.030
- You need his name so
when you see him fight

19:50.030 --> 19:51.940
you'll know we're even.

19:51.940 --> 19:54.740
- I've been waiting years
for some payback from you.

19:54.740 --> 19:55.750
- Name's Matt.

19:55.750 --> 19:57.220
- Matt.

19:57.220 --> 19:58.573
Okay, what's his last name.

19:59.780 --> 20:02.160
- He doesn't go by his last name.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.630
He likes to use a nickname,

20:03.630 --> 20:05.120
like a lot of these guys.

20:05.120 --> 20:05.960
- And what is it?

20:05.960 --> 20:08.330
- He likes to use The Doctor.

20:08.330 --> 20:09.430
- The Doctor?

20:09.430 --> 20:10.533
- The Doctor, yes.

20:12.120 --> 20:12.953
Write that down.

20:13.880 --> 20:15.300
- The Doctor.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.133
- Look for him.

20:16.133 --> 20:17.044
- Wait a minute.

20:17.044 --> 20:18.443
Why do they call him The Doctor?

20:19.410 --> 20:20.273
- They call him The Doctor

20:20.273 --> 20:23.350
because he's like a
surgeon with his punches.

20:23.350 --> 20:26.070
This guy, liver, kidneys,

20:26.070 --> 20:27.920
pancreas, bam!

20:27.920 --> 20:28.990
- Duodenum?

20:28.990 --> 20:29.900
- I don't know what that is,

20:29.900 --> 20:32.850
but I'm sure he does 'cause
this kid went to medical school

20:32.850 --> 20:35.094
just to learn where all that stuff is.

20:35.094 --> 20:35.927
- Ah.

20:37.380 --> 20:39.870
- Matt The Doctor?

20:39.870 --> 20:40.870
- Right.

20:40.870 --> 20:42.050
I'll see you, bud.

20:42.050 --> 20:43.000
- I got nothing here.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.010
You gave me nothing.

20:44.010 --> 20:47.560
- Benny, this is you and me.

20:47.560 --> 20:50.000
I'm just showing you the
same love you've shown me.

20:50.000 --> 20:50.833
All right?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.655
I'll see you.

20:52.655 --> 20:53.705
- All right, hold on.

20:55.630 --> 20:58.643
For the love, I'm gonna bite.

21:00.370 --> 21:01.263
- Oh, really?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.073
You fight on Friday!

21:09.710 --> 21:10.960
- Just like that?

21:10.960 --> 21:12.030
For who?

21:12.030 --> 21:13.583
- My friend Benny Stone here.

21:14.460 --> 21:16.160
Pays 3K.

21:16.160 --> 21:18.537
That's headliner money in a regional.

21:18.537 --> 21:20.093
$500 advance.

21:21.400 --> 21:23.193
- Is the other guy a middleweight?

21:24.820 --> 21:25.653
- Will you stop?

21:26.890 --> 21:28.440
You ever hear of Rick The Kick?

21:33.640 --> 21:34.500
- Yeah, of course.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.660
Three and 0, two by knockout.

21:36.660 --> 21:38.680
- You got anything to
do but memorize that stuff?

21:38.680 --> 21:39.573
- I do, actually.

21:41.240 --> 21:43.170
So, how'd that happen?

21:43.170 --> 21:44.180
- How'd it happen?

21:44.180 --> 21:45.588
What's my name?

21:45.588 --> 21:46.421
- If it was that easy,

21:46.421 --> 21:48.270
why didn't you do the right
thing in the first place?

21:48.270 --> 21:51.330
- We just have a different
opinion about them.

21:51.330 --> 21:53.460
- Well, if you still think
you did the right thing,

21:53.460 --> 21:55.090
why fix it?

21:55.090 --> 21:57.040
- Because it's easier than killing you.

21:57.980 --> 21:58.813
- I see.

22:00.717 --> 22:02.180
- What're you doing now?

22:02.180 --> 22:03.420
- It's gotta be the right way, Hap,

22:03.420 --> 22:05.170
or else we just keep starting over.

22:06.230 --> 22:08.796
- You know what you're walking away from?

22:08.796 --> 22:10.490
There's no way.

22:10.490 --> 22:11.670
There's no way!

22:11.670 --> 22:13.240
You're not...

22:13.240 --> 22:15.430
I kept my promise, man!

22:15.430 --> 22:17.400
I kept my promise!

22:17.400 --> 22:18.363
All right!

22:24.070 --> 22:26.130
I'm not entirely comfortable

22:26.130 --> 22:28.413
with what happened to you at Victor's.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.063
- Can't risk you spending it.

22:44.440 --> 22:47.720
- Also, you get 30 percent, not 50.

22:47.720 --> 22:49.720
Plus you get to train me for this fight.

22:56.981 --> 22:59.564
That would leave you with a 50.

23:04.460 --> 23:06.770
- That leaves you 50 away from a dentist.

23:06.770 --> 23:07.603
- Well, then it's a good thing

23:07.603 --> 23:10.190
that the last thing I want isn't money.

23:10.190 --> 23:12.900
It's getting a little
claustrophobic in here.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.473
- My room has one bed.

23:15.820 --> 23:17.810
- That's fine, we'll alternate.

23:17.810 --> 23:18.643
I'll go first.

23:57.210 --> 23:58.850
What the?

23:58.850 --> 24:00.040
- Who are you?

24:00.040 --> 24:01.120
Who are you?

24:01.120 --> 24:02.281
- What the?

24:02.281 --> 24:03.263
- Why you do floor?

24:03.263 --> 24:04.412
- I sleep floor, what you think?

24:04.412 --> 24:05.292
- Well, who he?

24:05.292 --> 24:06.415
Who is he?

24:06.415 --> 24:08.460
- He's one of my
fighters, he's one of my guys.

24:08.460 --> 24:09.373
- Why sleep here?

24:09.373 --> 24:10.750
Huh, in your bed?

24:10.750 --> 24:11.583
- Will you get dressed?

24:11.583 --> 24:12.790
You're scaring him.

24:12.790 --> 24:14.440
- Fun, Hap, you funny.

24:14.440 --> 24:15.810
You love it!

24:15.810 --> 24:16.643
- Hey!

24:16.643 --> 24:17.726
Hey, come on!

24:18.800 --> 24:19.633
Ow!

24:19.633 --> 24:21.469
It's okay, it's okay!

24:21.469 --> 24:22.670
- Why sleep here?

24:22.670 --> 24:24.070
Why sleep?

24:44.220 --> 24:45.573
- I love you, Kitty!

24:47.263 --> 24:48.096
Goddamn.

24:50.132 --> 24:51.650
She's a wild cat.

24:51.650 --> 24:52.678
Woo!

24:52.678 --> 24:53.610
Hoo-hoo!

24:53.610 --> 24:56.390
- So, I was kina hoping
that would've lasted longer.

24:56.390 --> 24:57.823
- Yeah, well.

24:58.680 --> 25:01.150
She only know about 10 words of English.

25:01.150 --> 25:02.100
Throw in this room.

25:03.140 --> 25:04.103
Damn near perfect.

25:05.160 --> 25:05.993
- The room?

25:05.993 --> 25:06.826
She pays?

25:06.826 --> 25:07.753
- Well, it's her motel.

25:10.010 --> 25:10.910
Actually, it's her husband's.

25:10.910 --> 25:13.233
So if you think about it,

25:14.300 --> 25:15.400
she's totally perfect.

25:31.840 --> 25:33.220
You're still aiming for the bag.

25:33.220 --> 25:35.110
Punch through the bag.

25:35.110 --> 25:36.761
Come on, through it.

25:36.761 --> 25:37.594
Through it!

25:40.630 --> 25:41.563
- Say, Happy.

25:43.290 --> 25:44.577
I don't like to get in your business, man,

25:44.577 --> 25:48.293
but that Calvin Cray, or
whatever he calls himself,

25:49.380 --> 25:52.473
was hanging around earlier,
looking kinda serious.

25:53.440 --> 25:55.980
Well, keep your head on a swivel, brother.

25:55.980 --> 25:57.210
Why do you keep messing
with these guys anyway?

25:57.210 --> 25:58.108
Look at this?

25:58.108 --> 25:58.941
Are you kidding me?

25:58.941 --> 25:59.774
Are you serious, man?

26:00.840 --> 26:03.063
- Got any tape on Rick
The Kick there, Skinny?

26:07.530 --> 26:08.980
- Bullshit.

26:08.980 --> 26:10.720
You telling me he's fighting Rick?

26:10.720 --> 26:12.610
- Are you kidding me, Skinny?

26:12.610 --> 26:13.483
He got Rick?

26:14.350 --> 26:15.730
What am I doing here?

26:15.730 --> 26:17.130
Am I the only person in this gym

26:17.130 --> 26:19.060
that knows I'm the contender?

26:19.060 --> 26:19.893
- Not anymore.

26:23.889 --> 26:24.722
- Rick The Kick.

26:24.722 --> 26:25.770
Man's scary.

26:25.770 --> 26:27.760
- Scary when you see a
guy with a lot of fights

26:27.760 --> 26:29.010
who still looks good.

26:29.010 --> 26:30.490
- Hey, Happy-Go-Lucky.

26:30.490 --> 26:31.460
- Hey, Benny.

26:31.460 --> 26:32.293
- How are you?

26:32.293 --> 26:33.380
Good to see you.

26:33.380 --> 26:35.010
- You, too.

26:35.010 --> 26:36.360
Meet the next champ.

26:36.360 --> 26:37.810
- Nice to meet you, Mr. Stone.

26:37.810 --> 26:39.830
- Pleasure's mine, Champ.

26:39.830 --> 26:42.830
You know, that would make
this a collector's item.

26:42.830 --> 26:45.190
It's your first poster as a pro.

26:45.190 --> 26:46.790
- Cool, I'll frame it.

26:48.470 --> 26:49.700
The Doctor?

26:49.700 --> 26:51.553
- Yes, sir, The Doctor.

26:53.710 --> 26:55.060
There you go, that's yours.

26:55.910 --> 26:57.363
Now, this is your contract.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.460
Right there's the title page.

27:02.460 --> 27:05.460
There's the blah, blah, blah, boilerplate.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.700
And then you come around here

27:06.700 --> 27:10.770
to the signature page and
you put yours right there

27:10.770 --> 27:12.380
on the pretty spot.

27:12.380 --> 27:14.530
- All right, I'll just look at the--

27:14.530 --> 27:15.936
- Hey, hey, hey, come on, come on.

27:15.936 --> 27:17.170
Just...

27:17.170 --> 27:18.130
Just sign it.

27:18.130 --> 27:19.170
- You don't need to take a look?

27:19.170 --> 27:22.580
- It's all boilerplate
for you at this point.

27:22.580 --> 27:23.480
- Sign it.

27:24.400 --> 27:25.750
- Boilerplate, okay.

27:27.630 --> 27:28.890
- Excellent.

27:28.890 --> 27:30.030
Done deal.

27:30.030 --> 27:31.970
Congratulations, you're
on your way, Doctor.

27:31.970 --> 27:33.608
- Thank you, sir.

27:33.608 --> 27:35.008
- Catch your later.

27:39.190 --> 27:41.543
- Excuse me, is
your name Happy McBride?

27:42.410 --> 27:43.480
- No, you got the wrong guy, man.

27:43.480 --> 27:45.680
- You look just like the guy my son, Matt,

27:45.680 --> 27:46.680
saw on the internet.

27:47.938 --> 27:48.771
- Oh.

27:50.360 --> 27:51.193
New York.

27:52.400 --> 27:53.233
Sorry, man.

27:53.233 --> 27:55.610
A lot of people come
here looking for me, so.

27:55.610 --> 27:58.043
- That's exactly what he
told his mother he'd do.

28:00.014 --> 28:00.847
- He did.

28:00.847 --> 28:02.480
I told him I'm not a manager though.

28:02.480 --> 28:04.000
- You have seen him?

28:04.000 --> 28:04.833
- Yeah.

28:06.300 --> 28:07.133
A couple days ago.

28:07.133 --> 28:08.810
- Can you tell him where I can find him?

28:10.481 --> 28:11.314
- I have no idea.

28:11.314 --> 28:12.373
He's pretty beat up.

28:13.379 --> 28:15.223
I'll tell you what would be my guess.

28:16.060 --> 28:17.710
Probably beat you back to New York.

28:17.710 --> 28:18.783
Probably beat you back.

28:18.783 --> 28:20.430
- What're you doing?

28:20.430 --> 28:21.343
- What am I doing?

28:21.343 --> 28:22.290
What do you mean, what am I doing?

28:22.290 --> 28:23.220
I'm giving you information.

28:23.220 --> 28:24.730
You ask me a question,
I give you the answer.

28:24.730 --> 28:26.383
What do you want from me?

28:26.383 --> 28:28.370
- Well, help me find my son.

28:28.370 --> 28:29.203
Would you, please?

28:29.203 --> 28:30.110
- I told you what I know.

28:30.110 --> 28:32.610
He came, I told him, I couldn't help him.

28:32.610 --> 28:33.900
He left.

28:33.900 --> 28:35.713
I'm a fighter, I'm not a manager.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.560
- Oh, Matthew, right?

28:55.560 --> 28:56.803
Matt?

28:56.803 --> 28:58.706
- Yeah, Nikki, right?

28:58.706 --> 29:00.600
- Your eye looks
a lot better than it did.

29:00.600 --> 29:02.310
- Yeah, you look great as well.

29:02.310 --> 29:03.660
- Would you like a coffee?

29:03.660 --> 29:04.930
- Uh, ice tea would be preferable.

29:04.930 --> 29:06.237
- Sure.
- Thank you.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.690
- I was gonna ask you how
you ended up on my doorstep.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.973
- Yeah, I followed her.

29:20.973 --> 29:23.070
- What a coincidence seeing
the two of you together.

29:23.070 --> 29:24.470
- Oh, no coincidence, honey.

29:25.490 --> 29:26.940
I told him the food here was great.

29:26.940 --> 29:29.860
A salad for the guy trying to make weight.

29:29.860 --> 29:31.233
Apple pie for me, Nik.

29:33.700 --> 29:35.990
You see how I covered for you there?

29:35.990 --> 29:37.650
- Yeah, well, it's also lying.

29:37.650 --> 29:39.800
- Please don't start
another fight in here.

29:40.730 --> 29:42.887
Salad for you and apple pie.

29:44.750 --> 29:46.010
So, Matt.

29:46.010 --> 29:47.559
Did you find the guy who robbed you?

29:49.262 --> 29:50.900
- What, do you speak French now?

29:50.900 --> 29:52.858
- That's German, Dad.

29:52.858 --> 29:54.177
- Yeah.

30:19.863 --> 30:21.843
- French.

30:23.634 --> 30:26.051
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

30:27.634 --> 30:28.467
- French.

30:32.174 --> 30:33.007
- What the hell are you doing?

30:33.007 --> 30:34.431
- What're you doing, huh?

30:34.431 --> 30:35.264
What're you doing?

30:35.264 --> 30:36.254
- Hap, what's wrong with you?

30:36.254 --> 30:37.087
- What're you doing?

30:37.087 --> 30:38.930
We got plans, okay?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.890
She was gonna work at the UN,
she was gonna work at a bank.

30:40.890 --> 30:41.840
She's studying.

30:41.840 --> 30:42.960
- I understand, Hap.

30:42.960 --> 30:44.367
You just want the best for her.

30:44.367 --> 30:45.717
- No, you don't understand.

30:47.290 --> 30:48.580
The first half of that girl's life,

30:48.580 --> 30:50.050
with her mom, was not good.

30:50.050 --> 30:51.670
I'm not gonna watch anybody
mess up the second half.

30:51.670 --> 30:54.210
- Well, what makes you think
that I would mess her up?

30:54.210 --> 30:56.130
- Why are you even asking if
you're not considering it?

30:56.130 --> 30:57.940
- I'm just wondering because I wanna know

30:57.940 --> 30:59.070
why you feel that way about me.

30:59.070 --> 31:00.680
- You're a fighter.

31:00.680 --> 31:02.600
- You're a fighter!

31:02.600 --> 31:04.077
- Why are we
still talking about this?

31:04.077 --> 31:04.910
- I don't know!

31:04.910 --> 31:05.770
You're the one that's talking about--

31:05.770 --> 31:07.490
- You stay away from her!

31:07.490 --> 31:08.323
You stay away from her!

31:08.323 --> 31:10.360
- You're a mad man!

31:10.360 --> 31:11.980
- You'll find out what a mad man is.

31:11.980 --> 31:12.813
It's gonna get a lot worse than that.

31:12.813 --> 31:14.470
You've got weight to lose.

31:14.470 --> 31:16.770
Come on, one, two, one, two, one, two.

31:16.770 --> 31:19.120
- I think I'm light enough.

31:19.120 --> 31:20.670
- Few more minutes.

31:20.670 --> 31:22.423
- It's been half an hour.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.000
- It's been 12 minutes.

31:26.000 --> 31:27.550
- But my feet are burning.

31:27.550 --> 31:28.850
- Just getting started.

31:28.850 --> 31:30.520
- Is this supposed to make me itch?

31:30.520 --> 31:34.413
- Rick The Kick Kline, 170 pounds.

31:35.640 --> 31:39.280
And now Matt The Doctor Bradford,

31:39.280 --> 31:40.837
weighing in at 169.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.823
169 pounds.

31:45.800 --> 31:48.490
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's an exciting matchup.

31:48.490 --> 31:50.721
We'll see you all tomorrow.

31:50.721 --> 31:52.880
- I'm gonna mess up that
pretty face of yours, bro.

31:52.880 --> 31:53.713
All night.

31:53.713 --> 31:55.141
I'm gonna pound that thing in all night.

31:55.141 --> 31:57.974
- Yeah, yeah, settle down.

32:01.442 --> 32:02.275
- You kidding me?

32:02.275 --> 32:03.360
- Save it for the fight.

32:03.360 --> 32:04.370
- I'll beat all night, old man!

32:04.370 --> 32:05.477
I'll take you on, too!
- Hello?

32:05.477 --> 32:06.310
- Get him out of here!

32:06.310 --> 32:07.409
- Hey, Matt, it's Nikki.

32:07.409 --> 32:08.520
- How'd you get my number?

32:08.520 --> 32:10.530
- My dad
and I share a phone plan.

32:10.530 --> 32:12.630
Anyways, I just wanted to say I was sorry.

32:12.630 --> 32:14.270
I was rude when we spoke.

32:14.270 --> 32:17.124
I just know my dad wouldn't
do that to anybody.

32:17.124 --> 32:18.043
- Hold on.

32:19.034 --> 32:20.810
- I'll get a ride with Benny.

32:20.810 --> 32:21.643
- Okay.

32:21.643 --> 32:22.720
- Okay?

32:22.720 --> 32:23.710
You all right?

32:23.710 --> 32:24.543
- Yeah.

32:25.710 --> 32:26.543
- All right.

32:27.930 --> 32:30.410
- Listen, I was wondering,
can we meet later?

32:30.410 --> 32:31.243
- Sure.

32:33.650 --> 32:35.250
- All right, thanks man.

32:35.250 --> 32:36.631
Appreciate it, bro.

32:36.631 --> 32:37.464
- You're welcome.

32:37.464 --> 32:38.330
You what what I always say.

32:38.330 --> 32:39.310
- What's that?

32:39.310 --> 32:40.910
- I was hoping you knew.

32:47.390 --> 32:49.570
- Happy, good of you to stop by.

32:49.570 --> 32:51.412
I was just leaving.

32:51.412 --> 32:52.810
- What the hell are you
doing in my room, man?

32:52.810 --> 32:54.633
How'd you get in here?

32:54.633 --> 32:57.230
- You know exactly what I'm doing here.

32:57.230 --> 33:00.110
Look, you give me my money

33:00.110 --> 33:01.760
and I'll give you your belt back.

33:04.640 --> 33:05.620
- Forget who I am, Cray?

33:05.620 --> 33:07.949
- Don't walk up on me, old man.

33:07.949 --> 33:08.782
- Yeah?

33:08.782 --> 33:10.123
- I ain't worried about you, pops.

33:13.150 --> 33:14.050
Really?

33:14.050 --> 33:16.983
- Cray, you ain't doing nothing.

33:18.930 --> 33:20.430
- I would move out of the way.

33:27.740 --> 33:30.245
No need to get up, old man.

33:30.245 --> 33:32.038
- You fucking.

33:32.038 --> 33:35.235
- Go to sleep.

33:52.523 --> 33:57.523
- I don't think I'm gonna be
able to hang out much longer.

33:57.590 --> 33:59.853
- Did my dad tell you
to stay away from me?

34:01.548 --> 34:02.870
- Yeah.

34:02.870 --> 34:04.760
- Sometimes I think
he's looking out for me

34:04.760 --> 34:06.333
just a little too good.

34:06.333 --> 34:07.593
- I think you're lucky,

34:08.460 --> 34:10.690
someone looking out for you like that.

34:10.690 --> 34:12.889
- Believe me, I don't
take that for granted.

34:14.150 --> 34:14.983
- I know.

34:15.980 --> 34:17.810
- What'd he tell you?

34:17.810 --> 34:19.520
- No details, just...

34:22.600 --> 34:25.132
How it wasn't too good
for you with your mom.

34:26.929 --> 34:28.770
- She just never was there.

34:28.770 --> 34:31.250
From what I've heard, she
really went off the deep side

34:31.250 --> 34:32.353
after they split up.

34:35.710 --> 34:37.900
- Must've really cared about her.

34:37.900 --> 34:39.913
- I think it was more about

34:39.913 --> 34:41.190
what she could have become

34:41.190 --> 34:42.940
when she wouldn't have quit school.

34:44.920 --> 34:47.380
Also, about my dad becoming

34:47.380 --> 34:49.362
undependable as a fighter.

34:52.630 --> 34:54.533
- Well, that explains a lot.

34:59.954 --> 35:02.395
I think it's good he stepped in for you.

35:02.395 --> 35:03.595
- Well, he kinda had to.

35:04.620 --> 35:06.520
Didn't he tell you she killed herself?

35:11.350 --> 35:12.183
- No.

35:24.540 --> 35:26.233
- If we keep talking about this,

35:26.233 --> 35:28.450
will you promise to never tell him?

35:28.450 --> 35:30.420
- I wish I could, but if he asks.

35:30.420 --> 35:32.370
- Do you always tell the truth?

35:34.283 --> 35:35.400
- Yeah.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.853
- Always or always-always?

35:38.950 --> 35:39.833
- All three.

35:43.180 --> 35:44.320
What're you doing?

35:44.320 --> 35:45.200
- Changing.

35:45.200 --> 35:47.200
Cleaner back here than in the restrooms.

35:49.380 --> 35:50.840
- You're gonna get me killed.

35:50.840 --> 35:52.040
- Oh by the way, Matthew.

35:52.040 --> 35:53.850
While you're telling him the truth,

35:53.850 --> 35:55.150
make sure to mention this.

36:07.200 --> 36:08.670
- Sorry.

36:08.670 --> 36:10.470
You're in bed early.

36:10.470 --> 36:12.810
- Gotta get my sleep, we
got a big fight tomorrow.

36:12.810 --> 36:14.203
- Still early enough.

36:16.063 --> 36:17.370
- I got you something.

36:17.370 --> 36:18.263
In my bag.

36:23.070 --> 36:25.050
- These are great.

36:25.050 --> 36:26.960
- Come on, they're shorts.

36:26.960 --> 36:27.793
- No, seriously.

36:27.793 --> 36:29.109
You didn't have to get me these.

36:29.109 --> 36:30.069
- Don't be too happy about it.

36:30.069 --> 36:32.263
I've been trying to sell
those for two years.

36:33.614 --> 36:34.660
- What the hell happened to your eye?

36:34.660 --> 36:35.820
- Come on.

36:35.820 --> 36:36.920
- Who did that?

36:39.420 --> 36:40.660
- Sue.

36:40.660 --> 36:43.247
- Sue did that to your eye?

36:43.247 --> 36:44.597
- I'm no longer undefeated.

36:47.810 --> 36:49.160
Of course, different weight classes,

36:49.160 --> 36:52.390
so technically it doesn't count.

36:52.390 --> 36:54.340
- Unless, of course, it's unsanctioned.

36:59.802 --> 37:00.635
All right.

37:14.990 --> 37:16.560
- Happy, you got three minutes.

37:16.560 --> 37:17.413
Go get 'em, Doc!

37:20.620 --> 37:21.883
- Get your head right, brother.

37:23.410 --> 37:24.670
- Hey.

37:24.670 --> 37:26.320
- Dad.

37:26.320 --> 37:28.120
- Is that any way to say hello, son?

37:29.090 --> 37:29.923
- Sorry.

37:30.893 --> 37:31.726
- It's okay.

37:33.993 --> 37:34.826
- Good to see you.

37:34.826 --> 37:35.733
- Good to see you.

37:37.660 --> 37:39.770
- Happy, this is my dad.

37:39.770 --> 37:40.603
- Yeah, we met.

37:40.603 --> 37:42.500
He wasn't very forthcoming
with information,

37:42.500 --> 37:44.283
but I found your fight online.

37:45.140 --> 37:46.050
Son, we need to talk.

37:46.050 --> 37:50.180
- Yeah, well now is obviously
not the time to talk.

37:50.180 --> 37:52.303
So, you're gonna have to leave.

37:53.203 --> 37:54.927
- It's all right, Hap.

37:54.927 --> 37:55.760
- You sure?

37:57.310 --> 37:58.143
Hey.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.760
- Listen to me.

38:05.760 --> 38:08.573
I need you to walk away
from this right now with me.

38:10.190 --> 38:12.460
- We talked about me doing this, Dad.

38:12.460 --> 38:13.720
- Matt, I didn't come all this way

38:13.720 --> 38:15.253
to talk about the same thing.

38:19.140 --> 38:20.583
- Calling your name, brother.

38:23.553 --> 38:24.386
- Matt.

38:26.193 --> 38:27.276
- Sorry, Dad.

38:28.673 --> 38:31.150
- Hey, hey, hey, come on.

38:31.150 --> 38:33.290
If he wants to go with you, he'll go.

38:33.290 --> 38:36.503
Not like this and not now.

38:45.115 --> 38:46.488
- Bye, Dad.

38:50.587 --> 38:53.251
You didn't tell me my dad showed up.

38:53.251 --> 38:55.380
- You didn't seem like you
wanted to talk about that.

38:55.380 --> 38:56.933
- I was gonna say thanks.

38:59.050 --> 39:00.260
Why is there never a cage?

39:00.260 --> 39:01.733
- The old becomes new again.

39:02.670 --> 39:04.710
These smokers are catching on, man.

39:04.710 --> 39:06.170
- Stay focused.

39:06.170 --> 39:08.698
Study him a little while, all right?

39:08.698 --> 39:09.531
Okay, have a good fight.

39:09.531 --> 39:11.540
- You know this
guy's a kicker, right?

39:12.700 --> 39:14.760
- Rick, come on, baby.

39:14.760 --> 39:15.912
All right.

39:15.912 --> 39:17.062
- You stay inside that.

39:18.983 --> 39:21.070
He'll throw all combinations.

39:21.070 --> 39:22.650
No solo punches.

39:22.650 --> 39:23.747
Cut his angles.

39:25.810 --> 39:26.765
You understand?

39:26.765 --> 39:28.110
- Okay.

39:33.001 --> 39:33.834
- Hey!

39:33.834 --> 39:35.030
What's Larry doing here?

39:35.030 --> 39:36.330
- He owns the place.

39:36.330 --> 39:37.760
He owns all of 'em.

39:43.114 --> 39:44.686
- Fight!

39:59.700 --> 40:00.540
- Combinations!

40:00.540 --> 40:01.670
Stop the single punches!

40:01.670 --> 40:03.251
Combinations!

40:22.854 --> 40:24.311
Stay warm, stay warm.

40:24.311 --> 40:25.144
Stay warm.

40:28.340 --> 40:30.657
You're no good on the ground,
but that guy's worse, okay?

40:30.657 --> 40:32.661
You take it to the ground.

40:32.661 --> 40:34.809
Just take him to the ground.

40:34.809 --> 40:36.362
- Yeah!

40:36.362 --> 40:37.195
- Ready.

40:38.028 --> 40:39.448
- Fight!

40:47.110 --> 40:48.383
- Take him to the ground!

40:49.550 --> 40:50.542
Down!

41:31.307 --> 41:32.140
- Oh, hi.

41:33.501 --> 41:34.751
Take a picture.

41:37.469 --> 41:38.302
Thank you.

41:42.256 --> 41:44.020
- Oh.

41:44.020 --> 41:45.900
Ah, killer, huh?

41:45.900 --> 41:47.153
Killer, I got something for you.

41:47.153 --> 41:47.986
This is Davey.

41:47.986 --> 41:50.037
Davey gonna get us some bitches.

41:50.037 --> 41:51.210
Some more bitches.

41:51.210 --> 41:52.310
You're too old.

41:52.310 --> 41:53.434
Let's go, man.

41:53.434 --> 41:54.377
- You're not coming?

41:54.377 --> 41:57.177
- I already got enough of a
bitch on my hands, remember?

41:58.035 --> 42:00.593
- Okay.

42:08.373 --> 42:09.206
- Hey, Larry.

42:14.396 --> 42:15.229
Lar.

42:16.110 --> 42:16.943
Hey.

42:17.878 --> 42:18.711
- Hey.

42:21.068 --> 42:23.108
- Ah, you're looking good, brother.

42:23.108 --> 42:24.943
Looking good.

42:24.943 --> 42:26.309
It's been too long.

42:26.309 --> 42:27.142
- Yeah.

42:27.142 --> 42:28.860
How you doing, Hap?

42:28.860 --> 42:30.810
- Never been in better shape.

42:30.810 --> 42:31.670
- How is, uh...

42:31.670 --> 42:32.840
How's my little girl?

42:32.840 --> 42:34.310
How's little Nikki?

42:34.310 --> 42:36.630
- Nikki's no little girl anymore.

42:36.630 --> 42:38.570
She speaks five languages.

42:38.570 --> 42:40.660
She's gonna be working at the UN.

42:40.660 --> 42:41.840
- Wow.

42:41.840 --> 42:42.850
- How's Anne?

42:42.850 --> 42:44.330
- Amber.

42:44.330 --> 42:45.686
- Amber.

42:45.686 --> 42:47.086
It has been too long, right?

42:49.590 --> 42:50.710
Hey.
- Hey, Hap.

42:50.710 --> 42:52.129
- There he is.

42:52.129 --> 42:53.640
You know who Larry Crowley is?

42:53.640 --> 42:55.020
- Yeah, of course.

42:55.020 --> 42:56.560
He's your manager.

42:56.560 --> 42:57.763
- He still is, right?

42:59.010 --> 42:59.960
- You managing him?

43:03.740 --> 43:05.740
- We just did one fight.

43:05.740 --> 43:07.680
- Just helping him out.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.513
- Look, uh...

43:10.476 --> 43:13.020
Whoever you land with,
have him give me a call.

43:13.020 --> 43:14.120
Set up a meeting.

43:14.120 --> 43:14.953
- Yeah.

43:14.953 --> 43:15.786
Thank you so much.

43:15.786 --> 43:17.356
I'd love to fight for you, Mr. Crowley.

43:17.356 --> 43:19.030
- Good fight tonight.

43:19.030 --> 43:21.010
- Hey, Larry, it's good to see you.

43:21.010 --> 43:22.400
- Whoa, whoa.

43:22.400 --> 43:24.200
That's not who I think it is, right?

43:27.305 --> 43:29.388
Get the hell out of here.

43:30.582 --> 43:33.903
- I'm gonna hit the head, man.

43:33.903 --> 43:35.253
- You ain't even that good.

43:42.160 --> 43:44.504
- Nobody can touch Happy McBride!

43:44.504 --> 43:45.504
Nobody will!

43:48.465 --> 43:49.298
Hit 'em!

43:49.298 --> 43:50.131
Get in there!

43:50.131 --> 43:51.964
Come on, get in there!

43:53.020 --> 43:54.990
Stop messing around, Happy!

44:00.420 --> 44:01.930
- Bitch.

44:01.930 --> 44:04.970
- So, it's not even that
you were that good for me.

44:04.970 --> 44:07.270
It's the fact that you did that

44:07.270 --> 44:09.343
despite working with Pappy McBride.

44:10.660 --> 44:12.180
- Well, he was champ.

44:12.180 --> 44:13.220
- Yeah, I'm aware of that.

44:13.220 --> 44:14.860
For 15 minutes.

44:14.860 --> 44:17.090
And he wasn't much even then.

44:17.090 --> 44:17.923
Listen to me.

44:17.923 --> 44:19.500
He's a snake, all right?

44:19.500 --> 44:20.690
He bites people.

44:20.690 --> 44:22.140
He ruins people.

44:22.140 --> 44:23.260
That's what he does.

44:23.260 --> 44:25.070
He can't escape his nature.

44:25.070 --> 44:28.370
So, you call me when he bites you

44:28.370 --> 44:30.820
and I will suck that poison
out wherever you are.

44:37.210 --> 44:39.130
- What are you doing up here?

44:39.130 --> 44:40.343
- Oh, I was...

44:41.943 --> 44:43.160
I was looking for an exit.

44:43.160 --> 44:44.023
Got lost.

44:44.960 --> 44:46.530
- Right.

44:46.530 --> 44:47.380
One for the road?

44:52.060 --> 44:54.380
Look, I would like to make a toast.

44:54.380 --> 44:57.280
Look, I know that we've
had our rough patches, but.

44:57.280 --> 44:59.310
- Come on, you
don't have to do that.

44:59.310 --> 45:00.560
- Just hear me out, okay?

45:02.250 --> 45:05.310
No one's ever done anything
like this for me before.

45:11.740 --> 45:12.573
Oh, wow.

45:12.573 --> 45:13.406
That's strong.

45:16.100 --> 45:17.853
I was thinking we keep it going.

45:19.510 --> 45:21.570
- You already know the answer to that.

45:21.570 --> 45:22.403
- Hap, look.

45:22.403 --> 45:23.236
Now that you're training,

45:23.236 --> 45:25.100
you're gonna need someone to work with.

45:26.040 --> 45:28.450
And if I ever get in your way
all you have to do is say so.

45:28.450 --> 45:29.750
- I don't need this, okay?

45:29.750 --> 45:30.793
If that's why you're up here.

45:30.793 --> 45:32.260
- Hap, what are you talking about?

45:32.260 --> 45:33.970
I'm the one who needs this.

45:33.970 --> 45:37.850
Look, now that I've won, it'll
be so much easier for you.

45:37.850 --> 45:40.963
Plus, now we have the
funds to spread around.

45:42.280 --> 45:43.113
Huh?

45:44.940 --> 45:47.340
- Sounds a little too
much like being a manager.

45:48.400 --> 45:49.233
- Jeez.

45:49.233 --> 45:50.340
Well, will you think about it?

45:53.040 --> 45:55.603
- Yeah, I will.

45:57.794 --> 45:58.744
- You okay?

46:00.260 --> 46:01.093
- Yeah.

46:02.040 --> 46:05.736
Thank you.

46:05.736 --> 46:09.031
- He won?

46:09.031 --> 46:09.864
- He did.

46:13.607 --> 46:15.253
And he got a meeting with Larry.

46:17.250 --> 46:19.133
- Well, that means you win too, right?

46:20.860 --> 46:22.610
- Well, I'd have to stick with him.

46:23.700 --> 46:24.950
- Keep Matt going.

46:24.950 --> 46:26.250
Get a dozen more fighters.

46:28.320 --> 46:30.470
- Never feels as good
as doing it yourself.

46:31.665 --> 46:34.390
- I know, but it would be
a different kind of good.

46:34.390 --> 46:35.283
Helping others.

46:36.360 --> 46:38.059
- Sure would.

46:38.059 --> 46:38.976
- It would.

46:43.860 --> 46:45.960
- What are you trying to say, Knick-Knack?

46:45.960 --> 46:46.860
- Nothing.

46:50.220 --> 46:51.053
- Thank you.

47:01.387 --> 47:03.843
You remind me so much of your mother.

47:06.080 --> 47:07.183
- How's that?

47:15.520 --> 47:16.920
Why do you think she did it?

47:18.948 --> 47:20.703
- Honey, that's a complicated question.

47:22.130 --> 47:23.953
- Did she ever talk about it?

47:25.068 --> 47:26.460
- No.

47:26.460 --> 47:29.630
I mean, we had the same
problems other couples did, but.

47:29.630 --> 47:30.949
- It's me then.

47:30.949 --> 47:33.549
I kept her from living the
life she wanted to live.

47:33.549 --> 47:36.223
- Honey, I wanted you.

47:37.940 --> 47:41.269
If that were the case, she
wouldn't let me have you.

47:41.269 --> 47:42.790
Right?

47:42.790 --> 47:43.623
Come on.

47:43.623 --> 47:44.923
Where are you going with this?

47:46.512 --> 47:48.853
- You know, it can be passed down.

47:50.516 --> 47:51.349
- What?

47:53.300 --> 47:56.059
- If nothing caused it,
then it must be genetic.

47:59.400 --> 48:00.233
- No.

48:46.715 --> 48:47.901
- What are you watching?

48:47.901 --> 48:48.734
- Nothing.

48:50.452 --> 48:53.119
- Did you think about it?

48:54.090 --> 48:54.923
- Yeah.

48:56.780 --> 48:57.613
Yeah, I did.

48:59.077 --> 49:00.227
But I got one question.

49:02.958 --> 49:03.791
What was going through your head

49:03.791 --> 49:05.921
when you went red on that guy?

49:05.921 --> 49:07.588
- What do you think?

49:08.441 --> 49:10.341
- Well, something to do with your dad?

49:12.490 --> 49:13.723
- Too many somethings.

49:16.200 --> 49:20.653
The thing I was thinking about is stupid.

49:21.500 --> 49:23.403
- Well, I gotta know.

49:24.650 --> 49:29.650
- I had this cat, Pepper,
since before I can remember.

49:32.470 --> 49:34.693
She was older, 17.

49:36.020 --> 49:37.720
So, when I left school
we thought it'd be best

49:37.720 --> 49:39.967
if my mom looked after her.

49:41.050 --> 49:45.163
Wasn't long after that that
my dad just put her down.

49:47.690 --> 49:51.213
He didn't even call to talk
to me about it or anything.

49:52.362 --> 49:53.412
He just put her down.

49:57.852 --> 49:58.685
I don't know.

49:58.685 --> 50:02.183
Maybe it's as much my fault
for leaving her there.

50:05.070 --> 50:08.200
Maybe I just feel that way
because there's so many

50:08.200 --> 50:10.600
other times where he just
didn't do right by me.

50:15.567 --> 50:17.734
He just wasn't there, Hap.

50:19.007 --> 50:20.533
Does that answer your question?

50:22.207 --> 50:25.251
- Yeah.

50:25.251 --> 50:28.840
Yeah.

50:28.840 --> 50:30.690
It wasn't the reason I asked, though.

50:32.160 --> 50:36.023
I just gotta make sure
if you're sleeping here,

50:37.210 --> 50:39.010
going red had nothing to do with me.

50:41.450 --> 50:42.283
You did good.

50:45.935 --> 50:46.768
All right, throw it, throw it.

50:46.768 --> 50:47.601
Now, slip it.

50:47.601 --> 50:48.434
Slip it.

50:48.434 --> 50:50.010
Grab his neck, okay?

50:50.010 --> 50:50.843
Lock the hands.

50:50.843 --> 50:51.683
Come on.

50:51.683 --> 50:52.516
Come on, just like that.

50:52.516 --> 50:53.730
All right, pull him down.

50:53.730 --> 50:55.450
I want those elbows together.

50:55.450 --> 50:56.750
I want those elbows together.

50:56.750 --> 50:58.620
You got lots of air here, okay?

50:58.620 --> 50:59.453
Tuck your chin.

50:59.453 --> 51:01.590
- Hap, how about you show him?

51:01.590 --> 51:03.370
- What, does your mama
wait for you for dinner?

51:03.370 --> 51:04.203
- Sure, whatever.

51:04.203 --> 51:05.103
I want to go, yeah.
- Go on, go on.

51:09.120 --> 51:11.010
Down, okay?

51:11.010 --> 51:12.210
Elbows together.

51:12.210 --> 51:13.490
Try and get a punch through there.

51:13.490 --> 51:14.460
It's not gonna happen.

51:14.460 --> 51:15.490
Come on.

51:15.490 --> 51:16.323
Elbows.

51:16.323 --> 51:17.207
Look.

51:19.001 --> 51:19.940
You see that?

51:19.940 --> 51:21.030
I got your face.

51:21.030 --> 51:22.220
Elbows together.

51:22.220 --> 51:23.173
Now, tuck your chin, tuck your chin.

51:23.173 --> 51:24.891
Now, watch your head.

51:24.891 --> 51:26.200
Where your head goes, your body goes.

51:26.200 --> 51:27.940
Where your head goes, your body goes.

51:27.940 --> 51:28.773
- Very nice.

51:28.773 --> 51:30.703
- Left, right, out to
coffee, anywhere I want it.

51:30.703 --> 51:33.217
Missing your chance, missing your chance.

51:38.550 --> 51:39.383
I'm late.

51:39.383 --> 51:40.738
Got that meeting with Larry.

51:40.738 --> 51:43.249
- That's today?

51:43.249 --> 51:44.199
Is that today?

51:44.199 --> 51:45.680
- That's today.

51:45.680 --> 51:48.190
One hour, motel.

51:48.190 --> 51:49.023
- Okay.

51:49.023 --> 51:50.869
- Okay.
- Thank you.

51:50.869 --> 51:52.249
All right.

51:52.249 --> 51:53.082
Okay.

51:54.227 --> 51:55.877
- Wanna mix it up a little bit?

51:57.008 --> 51:58.289
- Not really.

51:58.289 --> 51:59.273
- You can't fight?

52:01.180 --> 52:02.270
- What's wrong, dude?

52:02.270 --> 52:05.010
- Why are you always defending him, huh?

52:05.010 --> 52:06.003
You know loyalty?

52:06.940 --> 52:09.253
It only means something if it's returned.

52:10.240 --> 52:14.570
If not, then somebody playing
you and you a sucker, hmm?

52:16.250 --> 52:17.197
- What are you talking about, man?

52:17.197 --> 52:18.447
- You wouldn't even know.

52:19.540 --> 52:20.373
I'm gonna tell you this, though.

52:20.373 --> 52:22.220
You wouldn't like it.

52:22.220 --> 52:23.053
That's for sure.

52:25.531 --> 52:27.991
- I don't know about this, Knack.

52:27.991 --> 52:29.719
- You look great.

52:29.719 --> 52:31.623
- I feel like I kind of
look like an old person.

52:31.623 --> 52:32.803
- No, distinguished.

52:32.803 --> 52:34.913
Just like a manager does.

52:43.030 --> 52:44.430
Hey, how's he look, Matthew?

52:46.250 --> 52:47.693
- Like a liar.

52:47.693 --> 52:48.700
- What the hell does that mean?

52:48.700 --> 52:51.090
- I'd like a word with your dad, please.

52:51.090 --> 52:53.550
- We don't keep any secrets.

52:53.550 --> 52:54.960
- Did you really put a bet

52:54.960 --> 52:56.443
on Rick The Kick against me?

52:57.550 --> 52:59.310
- Who told you about that?

52:59.310 --> 53:01.856
- You need to tell me you didn't do that.

53:01.856 --> 53:03.380
- I didn't do that.

53:03.380 --> 53:04.380
As your manager, I can't.

53:04.380 --> 53:05.670
I had someone else do it.

53:05.670 --> 53:07.600
What business is that of yours?

53:07.600 --> 53:10.380
- Are you really asking me that right now?

53:10.380 --> 53:12.350
- Nikki, you see a problem with this?

53:12.350 --> 53:13.320
- Yeah, Nikki.

53:13.320 --> 53:14.740
Do you see a problem with this?

53:14.740 --> 53:17.620
- Obviously, you didn't
know during the fight.

53:17.620 --> 53:18.453
- Exactly.

53:18.453 --> 53:19.290
How's it hurt you?

53:19.290 --> 53:20.220
Did you win?

53:20.220 --> 53:21.320
- Yeah, but it's the--

53:21.320 --> 53:23.230
- Yeah, but.

53:23.230 --> 53:24.593
I'm the one who got hurt.

53:25.560 --> 53:27.023
Lost 2,000 bucks, man.

53:27.920 --> 53:30.500
- You bet $2,000?

53:30.500 --> 53:31.333
- Yeah.

53:32.510 --> 53:34.710
Well, I bet the 30
percent I had on this one

53:36.350 --> 53:39.160
plus the money I won in his
fight against Cray-Cray.

53:39.160 --> 53:41.560
- You bet against me on
the other fight as well?

53:42.818 --> 53:43.680
- It really doesn't matter.

53:43.680 --> 53:45.390
It's all gone now, right?

53:45.390 --> 53:48.280
- Oh, well I guess I
should be apologizing then.

53:48.280 --> 53:51.930
- Actually, as long as
you're bringing it up,

53:51.930 --> 53:53.889
it would be the gentlemanly thing to do.

53:53.889 --> 53:57.597
- I'm not going to this meeting.

54:04.143 --> 54:05.610
- You're ridiculous.

54:05.610 --> 54:06.788
- Honey, come on.

54:06.788 --> 54:08.371
I lost 2,000 bucks.

54:09.460 --> 54:10.520
Yeah, go talk to him.

54:10.520 --> 54:15.340
Why you're out there, find
out how the hell he won.

54:15.340 --> 54:16.173
Don't be too nice.

54:16.173 --> 54:18.563
That 2,000 bucks was your college money.

54:20.549 --> 54:22.200
I'm supposed to believe in him?

54:22.200 --> 54:24.320
When does somebody start believing in me?

54:24.320 --> 54:26.730
- People see things
different all the time.

54:26.730 --> 54:28.450
- I'm not allowed
to make a couple bucks here?

54:28.450 --> 54:30.730
- This is just costing you a
lot more than it costs him.

54:30.730 --> 54:31.563
- You need to remind him

54:31.563 --> 54:32.396
he lived in a van when he met me.

54:32.396 --> 54:33.229
- Why do you keep
defending him all the time?

54:33.229 --> 54:35.413
- Remind him he still does.
- It's bullshit.

54:36.397 --> 54:37.250
I'm serious.

54:37.250 --> 54:38.880
Just over and over.

54:38.880 --> 54:41.310
- I'm not going
to this meeting, either.

54:41.310 --> 54:43.223
- Do you remember what he did for me?

54:44.550 --> 54:46.770
- What did he do for you?

54:46.770 --> 54:49.180
- You always ask why he stopped fighting.

54:49.180 --> 54:52.400
Did you ever think about
when he stopped fighting?

54:52.400 --> 54:54.913
Once he took me back so
he could take care of me?

54:55.823 --> 54:56.863
- Yeah.

54:56.863 --> 54:59.010
Well, that was also when
your mom did what she did.

54:59.010 --> 55:00.070
- I know you're still out there.

55:00.070 --> 55:00.903
I hear you whispering.

55:00.903 --> 55:03.777
- Do you ever wonder how he
felt about himself after that?

55:04.690 --> 55:07.333
I mean, he's gone gray in
just a couple of years, right?

55:10.370 --> 55:13.333
You're not the reason he
stopped being a fighter.

55:13.333 --> 55:14.330
- You better not be talking about

55:14.330 --> 55:15.343
anything except me.

55:19.410 --> 55:20.560
- Fine.

55:20.560 --> 55:21.913
We agree to disagree.

55:23.380 --> 55:24.383
I'll be in the van.

55:26.630 --> 55:27.680
- He's ready for you.

55:28.640 --> 55:29.473
Follow me.

55:37.370 --> 55:40.000
- Hey, we're past that, right?

55:40.000 --> 55:40.903
Old times.

55:43.187 --> 55:44.020
- Mr. Crowley.

55:44.020 --> 55:44.853
- Matt.

55:46.130 --> 55:47.960
Listen, I don't have a lot of time.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.760
I had a couple meetings pushed back.

55:51.210 --> 55:53.810
Saw some of your fights, Matt.

55:53.810 --> 55:54.943
I like your precision.

55:56.170 --> 55:57.070
You know this guy?

55:58.850 --> 55:59.683
- Of course.

55:59.683 --> 56:00.860
- Sonny Jim Jamison.

56:00.860 --> 56:02.010
Middleweight.

56:02.010 --> 56:02.843
Top contender.

56:04.710 --> 56:06.503
- My middleweight broke his hand.

56:07.430 --> 56:09.480
I need someone on my roster to fight him.

56:12.150 --> 56:13.710
- When?

56:13.710 --> 56:14.543
- Two weeks.

56:14.543 --> 56:15.376
- Great.

56:20.170 --> 56:21.003
- Boilerplate.

56:21.003 --> 56:23.310
Standard provisions for
where you are right now.

56:25.040 --> 56:28.110
- I'm gonna need a minute
to go through this with him.

56:28.110 --> 56:29.010
- Oh, I'm sorry.

56:29.010 --> 56:31.960
I thought it would all be
boilerplate for me at this point.

56:34.040 --> 56:34.990
- Give us a minute.

56:40.510 --> 56:41.430
- Thank you, Mr. Crowley.

56:41.430 --> 56:44.183
- Fellas, can you walk Matt out?

56:47.490 --> 56:48.340
Don't start, Hap.

56:49.430 --> 56:51.860
You know I give the best deals
for these kids starting out.

56:51.860 --> 56:54.170
- Larry, I just wanted a minute alone.

56:54.170 --> 56:55.520
- All right, I'm listening.

56:57.352 --> 56:59.290
- I really appreciate
what you're doing here.

56:59.290 --> 57:01.380
And I know why you're doing it.

57:01.380 --> 57:05.133
So, I've decided on that card, for you,

57:06.130 --> 57:07.230
I'm gonna fight again.

57:08.410 --> 57:11.160
- Wow, you just can't help
yourself, can you, Happy?

57:11.160 --> 57:12.440
You're messing with me even now.

57:12.440 --> 57:14.561
- No, I'm not.

57:14.561 --> 57:15.394
What are you talking about?

57:15.394 --> 57:16.227
I mean, I know it seems like that.

57:16.227 --> 57:18.970
It's been four or five
years, but it's not--

57:18.970 --> 57:20.400
- Eight or nine.

57:20.400 --> 57:21.650
- Eight.

57:21.650 --> 57:23.500
That's if you're counting.

57:23.500 --> 57:26.293
It's eight years of know-how, of training.

57:27.720 --> 57:29.550
I'm 30 again.

57:29.550 --> 57:31.530
You and I can start this
right where we left off.

57:31.530 --> 57:32.843
- Where you quit on me?

57:34.680 --> 57:35.993
- I didn't quit on you.

57:37.380 --> 57:39.970
You brought me a bunch of bums.

57:39.970 --> 57:41.794
- That's bullshit and you know it.

57:41.794 --> 57:42.627
- No, no.

57:42.627 --> 57:44.030
Me and him, two for one.

57:44.030 --> 57:45.030
Double card.

57:45.030 --> 57:46.460
Where's the old Larry?

57:46.460 --> 57:47.600
There he is.

57:47.600 --> 57:48.900
That's the guy I remember.

57:49.884 --> 57:50.717
- Huh?

57:50.717 --> 57:51.550
Come on.

57:51.550 --> 57:52.383
- I know what's underneath, brother.

57:52.383 --> 57:53.216
- Huh?

57:53.216 --> 57:54.050
- You love me and you know it.

57:54.050 --> 57:55.170
You love me, you know it.

57:55.170 --> 57:56.010
You know you love me.

57:56.010 --> 57:57.750
- You've always been a pain in the ass.

57:57.750 --> 57:58.583
- Come here, man.

57:58.583 --> 57:59.750
This is me.

57:59.750 --> 58:00.583
This is me, brother.

58:00.583 --> 58:02.160
Come on.

58:02.160 --> 58:03.320
Come on.

58:03.320 --> 58:04.153
- You're not 30.

58:07.198 --> 58:08.781
You're not even 40.

58:15.510 --> 58:16.460
- Jesus, look at this.

58:16.460 --> 58:18.813
How many people did it take
to get that thing in there?

58:19.930 --> 58:20.780
- A crew.

58:23.250 --> 58:24.550
- How old were those guys?

58:26.090 --> 58:27.331
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

58:27.331 --> 58:28.420
Hey.

58:28.420 --> 58:29.253
Stop with the desk.

58:29.253 --> 58:30.260
- Just one fight to you, Larry.

58:30.260 --> 58:31.780
This is nothing to you.

58:31.780 --> 58:33.700
- Every card I
put together is special.

58:33.700 --> 58:34.880
You know that.

58:34.880 --> 58:35.713
- This is special!

58:35.713 --> 58:36.593
This is me!

58:38.380 --> 58:40.210
- Put the desk down.

58:40.210 --> 58:41.910
It's from France.

58:41.910 --> 58:46.910
Whoever I get to fight you is
not gonna do anything for you.

58:47.190 --> 58:50.324
- Any fighter you get has gotta
be better than what I got.

58:50.324 --> 58:53.407
It's gotta be better than what I got.

59:04.880 --> 59:06.130
- I'll see what I can do.

59:06.980 --> 59:08.868
- What the hell happened in there?

59:08.868 --> 59:09.701
- It's all good.

59:11.810 --> 59:12.643
- Hey, Matt.

59:12.643 --> 59:13.610
- Hi, Joe.

59:13.610 --> 59:14.920
- Hap.

59:14.920 --> 59:16.120
- Fancy seeing you here.

59:17.690 --> 59:18.763
- Hey, hold up, Joe.

59:19.653 --> 59:22.223
Hey, why don't you go celebrate
with Owen like it's done.

59:25.679 --> 59:28.410
I have always wondered what that meant,

59:28.410 --> 59:30.137
fancy seeing you here.

59:30.137 --> 59:31.060
- Oh, come on, Hap.

59:31.060 --> 59:31.900
It means what it means.

59:31.900 --> 59:34.640
It's something you say
when you see someone

59:34.640 --> 59:36.060
you expect 'em to be here.

59:36.060 --> 59:36.900
- It didn't sound like that.

59:36.900 --> 59:38.300
Did you expect to see me here?

59:38.300 --> 59:39.133
- No.

59:39.133 --> 59:41.280
It can also mean surprise.

59:41.280 --> 59:43.180
Like when you see someone you know

59:43.180 --> 59:45.220
where you don't expect them.

59:45.220 --> 59:47.000
- And why would you not
expect me to be here?

59:47.000 --> 59:49.273
I knew this guy eight
years before you met him.

59:50.295 --> 59:52.607
- Listen, we got a meeting
we gotta get ready for.

59:54.560 --> 59:55.393
- No.

59:55.393 --> 59:56.226
- You know what, Happy?

59:56.226 --> 59:57.649
You're a...

59:57.649 --> 59:58.482
Fine.

59:59.590 --> 01:00:01.193
- Do you not remember who I am?

01:00:02.330 --> 01:00:06.020
Do you not remember who I am?

01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.823
- Fancy seeing you here.

01:00:10.430 --> 01:00:12.490
- McBride, what do you want, man?

01:00:12.490 --> 01:00:13.460
- I'll tell you what I want.

01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:16.000
I want you to say fancy meeting you here

01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:16.973
like you expected to see me.

01:00:16.973 --> 01:00:19.260
- What the hell is wrong with you?

01:00:19.260 --> 01:00:20.450
- Hey, Hap.

01:00:20.450 --> 01:00:22.800
Fancy to see you here, brother.

01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:24.040
Happy.

01:00:24.040 --> 01:00:24.873
Say it.

01:00:24.873 --> 01:00:26.210
- Fancy seeing you here, Hap.

01:00:26.210 --> 01:00:27.043
- Not like that.

01:00:27.043 --> 01:00:27.876
I want feeling.

01:00:27.876 --> 01:00:30.640
I want you to expect me here,
like you're happy to see me.

01:00:30.640 --> 01:00:33.140
- Fancy seeing you here, Happy.

01:00:33.140 --> 01:00:33.973
How's that?

01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:34.970
That's all I got.

01:00:34.970 --> 01:00:35.803
- One more time.

01:00:36.770 --> 01:00:39.380
One more time or I'm gonna rock you.

01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:41.310
- Happy seeing you here, Happy.

01:00:41.310 --> 01:00:42.250
Nice seeing ya.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:43.383
I'm happy to be here.

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:45.680
- Good to see you too, Joe.

01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:46.513
- Okay.

01:00:46.513 --> 01:00:47.346
- Good to see you.

01:00:47.346 --> 01:00:49.040
Did you say hi to Joe?

01:00:49.040 --> 01:00:49.873
- Hi, Joe.

01:00:49.873 --> 01:00:50.850
- Hey, fancy seeing you, kid.

01:00:50.850 --> 01:00:53.283
- Keep in mind who he is
every time you see him.

01:01:02.556 --> 01:01:03.389
We're on the ropes.

01:01:03.389 --> 01:01:04.667
You had me on the ropes.

01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:09.250
Hey, Skinny.

01:01:09.250 --> 01:01:10.420
- Hey.

01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:14.140
- I feel like I'm not getting
any rotation in my hips.

01:01:14.140 --> 01:01:15.290
- Hit the bag, brother.

01:01:18.270 --> 01:01:19.103
Yeah, Hap.

01:01:19.103 --> 01:01:19.936
I know.

01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.863
You're not getting your
hips through anymore.

01:01:24.710 --> 01:01:25.997
That pivot isn't working for you.

01:01:25.997 --> 01:01:27.450
You need to change levels.

01:01:27.450 --> 01:01:28.700
Change the way you throw
that right hand completely.

01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.290
Put your left out and stick it.

01:01:30.290 --> 01:01:31.341
Leave it there.

01:01:31.341 --> 01:01:32.710
Leave it right there, right there.

01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:33.543
Okay.

01:01:33.543 --> 01:01:35.860
Now, right here where you
would normally throw them.

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.505
Throw that pivot that right hand around.

01:01:38.505 --> 01:01:39.338
Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:01:39.338 --> 01:01:42.710
- I want you to drop your
hips and let that foot drag

01:01:42.710 --> 01:01:44.780
and your hips will come all
the way through naturally.

01:01:44.780 --> 01:01:45.630
Just let the foot drag.

01:01:45.630 --> 01:01:47.177
It's a half a step.

01:01:49.150 --> 01:01:50.770
Damn, Hap!

01:01:50.770 --> 01:01:52.030
Happy, glory days.

01:01:52.030 --> 01:01:53.180
They're coming, baby.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.090
Go.

01:01:54.090 --> 01:01:55.393
You're in it to win it.

01:01:56.685 --> 01:01:57.518
One more.

01:01:58.853 --> 01:02:00.566
He's not standing there looking at you.

01:02:00.566 --> 01:02:01.570
- I feel really good.

01:02:01.570 --> 01:02:02.517
Who loves you, my brother?

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.260
Hey, listen.

01:02:05.260 --> 01:02:07.710
Listen, I gotta hit the head, man.

01:02:07.710 --> 01:02:09.434
This is making everything move faster.

01:02:09.434 --> 01:02:10.930
- Well, what about me?

01:02:10.930 --> 01:02:11.830
I can, uh...

01:02:11.830 --> 01:02:13.220
Skinny, no?

01:02:13.220 --> 01:02:14.195
Now?

01:02:14.195 --> 01:02:15.028
What?

01:02:15.028 --> 01:02:18.193
Hap.

01:02:19.090 --> 01:02:21.170
- Do I look like I'm taking calls in here?

01:02:25.383 --> 01:02:26.813
Team McBride.

01:02:26.813 --> 01:02:27.717
- Hap, it's Freddy here.

01:02:27.717 --> 01:02:29.650
How goes it, man?

01:02:29.650 --> 01:02:30.940
- Hey, Steady Freddy.

01:02:30.940 --> 01:02:31.773
Never better.

01:02:31.773 --> 01:02:32.606
How you doing?

01:02:32.606 --> 01:02:33.439
- Good, good.

01:02:33.439 --> 01:02:34.450
No, it's all good, man.

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:35.283
Hey, listen.

01:02:35.283 --> 01:02:36.250
I got a fight for your kid.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:38.792
- Ah, really.

01:02:38.792 --> 01:02:39.710
Against who?

01:02:39.710 --> 01:02:42.730
- Um, I
can get him jack Roberts.

01:02:42.730 --> 01:02:43.680
What do you say?

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:46.810
- Gonna guarantee him
more fights with a win?

01:02:47.690 --> 01:02:50.270
- I'll give
you one in a great stadium.

01:02:50.270 --> 01:02:51.450
- Where is it?

01:02:51.450 --> 01:02:54.140
- Sunny
Tijuana in Baja, Mexico.

01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:55.930
- You gonna pay
for a hotel with that?

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:57.210
- Hap,
it's a two-hour ride.

01:02:57.210 --> 01:02:58.410
Why do you need a hotel?

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:00.609
- I don't know.

01:03:00.609 --> 01:03:01.960
You gotta get used to things down there.

01:03:01.960 --> 01:03:04.300
You gotta get used to
breathing that bad air.

01:03:04.300 --> 01:03:05.800
Gotta get used to fighting wet

01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:08.030
'cause you know they throw pee.

01:03:08.030 --> 01:03:09.510
Gotta get used to the food.

01:03:09.510 --> 01:03:12.060
You ever see anyone do
ground work with diarrhea?

01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:13.933
How much you paying, man?

01:03:13.933 --> 01:03:14.780
- 1,500, Hap.

01:03:14.780 --> 01:03:15.920
What do you say?

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:17.210
- Well, it sounds...

01:03:18.382 --> 01:03:20.090
Well, I think...

01:03:23.923 --> 01:03:24.760
- Huh?

01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:26.083
What's going on?

01:03:26.083 --> 01:03:27.533
I can't hear you, Hap.

01:03:27.533 --> 01:03:28.663
Hap, I can't hear ya.

01:03:28.663 --> 01:03:29.930
- You didn't hear me?

01:03:29.930 --> 01:03:31.720
I said it sounds like, you know.

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:33.220
It sounds like I might.

01:03:33.220 --> 01:03:34.053
- Matt, good luck.

01:03:34.053 --> 01:03:35.089
Really, Matt.

01:03:35.089 --> 01:03:36.710
- All right, all right.

01:03:36.710 --> 01:03:37.543
I get it.

01:03:37.543 --> 01:03:38.940
- Yeah, good luck, Matt.
- That's your answer, huh?

01:03:38.940 --> 01:03:39.990
- That's my answer.

01:03:39.990 --> 01:03:42.550
That's also the National
Anthem for gringos down there.

01:03:42.550 --> 01:03:43.383
Come on, Freddy.

01:03:43.383 --> 01:03:44.560
You gotta come back with a real offer.

01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:46.480
This kid's on his way up.

01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:47.710
What do you say?

01:03:49.150 --> 01:03:50.720
Hello?

01:03:50.720 --> 01:03:52.470
- So, we got an offer?

01:03:52.470 --> 01:03:53.820
They'll call, right?

01:03:53.820 --> 01:03:54.653
- Yeah, yeah.

01:03:54.653 --> 01:03:55.896
Who cares, you know?

01:03:55.896 --> 01:03:58.896
I mean, it's now more important
what you say no to than yes.

01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:06.020
- The person we said yes to hasn't called

01:04:06.020 --> 01:04:06.853
in a couple of weeks.

01:04:06.853 --> 01:04:09.180
Shouldn't we call him or something?

01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:10.023
- He'll call.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:13.183
Nobody knows Larry like I know Larry.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.631
He will call us.

01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:19.050
- I'm saying four hours isn't
a medical problem, brother.

01:04:19.050 --> 01:04:20.803
It's a scheduling problem, right?

01:04:22.390 --> 01:04:23.606
- Hey, Champ.

01:04:23.606 --> 01:04:25.160
What's up, baby?

01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:26.930
I heard you're training again.

01:04:26.930 --> 01:04:27.763
Hey, man.

01:04:27.763 --> 01:04:30.773
If you want to be the
champ, you might need this.

01:04:34.430 --> 01:04:35.551
What are you gonna do, little man?

01:04:35.551 --> 01:04:36.384
- No, man.

01:04:36.384 --> 01:04:37.217
Forget it, Happy.

01:04:37.217 --> 01:04:38.050
Come on, he's not worth it.

01:04:38.050 --> 01:04:38.883
Hey, bro, come on.

01:04:38.883 --> 01:04:39.900
Stop, let me call the cops.

01:04:39.900 --> 01:04:40.733
- Call the cops?

01:04:40.733 --> 01:04:42.428
Better call the ambulance.

01:04:43.810 --> 01:04:44.820
Really, old man?

01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.480
You know what happened last time.

01:04:46.480 --> 01:04:47.400
- What happened?

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.100
- You know exactly what
happened last time.

01:04:49.100 --> 01:04:50.580
- What, a sucker punch?

01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:51.413
- Sucker punch?

01:04:51.413 --> 01:04:52.246
- Sucker punch.

01:04:52.246 --> 01:04:53.240
- A sucker punch?

01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:54.093
Are you serious right now?

01:04:54.093 --> 01:04:55.999
- This is bullshit.

01:05:02.629 --> 01:05:05.134
- You really want to fuck with me?

01:05:18.938 --> 01:05:19.855
- Oh, whoa.

01:05:22.160 --> 01:05:23.890
I guess he was right about the ambulance.

01:05:23.890 --> 01:05:26.220
- Guess he forgot
who you were, Hap.

01:05:29.235 --> 01:05:31.568
- I don't blame him.

01:05:36.837 --> 01:05:37.670
- Hey, man.

01:05:37.670 --> 01:05:38.990
I don't want any trouble.

01:05:38.990 --> 01:05:40.567
- See you later.

01:05:40.567 --> 01:05:42.467
- You might as well pick a fight here.

01:05:43.310 --> 01:05:44.760
It'd be the only one you see.

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.561
- What are you saying?

01:05:47.561 --> 01:05:49.903
- You are not getting that fight.

01:05:52.180 --> 01:05:53.110
Look at me.

01:05:53.110 --> 01:05:54.900
You're not getting the fight.

01:05:54.900 --> 01:05:56.110
- All right, Big Joe.

01:05:56.110 --> 01:05:56.943
- Do you get it?

01:05:56.943 --> 01:05:58.230
- I get it.

01:05:58.230 --> 01:06:03.200
- So, this can't happen for
you unless they use him.

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.910
- Am I crazy or is this as
messed up as everyone says it is?

01:06:05.910 --> 01:06:08.143
- I don't see why this two
for one thing is hurting you.

01:06:08.143 --> 01:06:09.953
- Because I earned the fight.

01:06:10.950 --> 01:06:12.853
- You earned the fight together.

01:06:14.899 --> 01:06:16.930
- With him as a manager
and me as a fighter.

01:06:16.930 --> 01:06:19.300
- I'm so sure things
are going to work out.

01:06:19.300 --> 01:06:20.313
Why don't you just wait until they--

01:06:20.313 --> 01:06:22.483
- Because the fight's already gone.

01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:30.140
He's unbelievable.

01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.603
Just like my old man.

01:06:33.840 --> 01:06:36.297
Just keeps worrying about
himself and no one else.

01:06:36.297 --> 01:06:38.063
- Why do you keep coming back then?

01:06:41.629 --> 01:06:43.997
- You say that like you
already know the answer.

01:06:49.470 --> 01:06:50.510
- Hey, Dad.

01:06:50.510 --> 01:06:52.300
Just got off work.

01:06:52.300 --> 01:06:53.600
- I thought you were Matt.

01:06:54.534 --> 01:06:57.510
I thought you guys had been
out all night on a bender.

01:06:57.510 --> 01:06:59.030
- Did you eat?

01:06:59.030 --> 01:06:59.883
- No, I did not.

01:07:01.404 --> 01:07:02.237
Thank you.

01:07:05.033 --> 01:07:06.333
I've never been so hungry.

01:07:08.200 --> 01:07:10.730
- There's something I
want to talk to you about.

01:07:10.730 --> 01:07:11.563
- Me first.

01:07:15.780 --> 01:07:18.803
Now, I know we've been getting by.

01:07:20.670 --> 01:07:22.830
That's not good enough.

01:07:22.830 --> 01:07:24.280
Everything's about to change.

01:07:25.590 --> 01:07:28.663
- Dad, about that fight you're planning.

01:07:33.510 --> 01:07:34.850
- What is this?

01:07:34.850 --> 01:07:37.030
- Matt passed by the diner
looking for you last night.

01:07:37.030 --> 01:07:38.103
He had this.

01:07:48.378 --> 01:07:50.150
- It was a done deal!

01:07:50.150 --> 01:07:51.910
- Well, what did you think would happen?

01:07:51.910 --> 01:07:53.030
- Well, it's gotta be Big Joe.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:55.580
He's been trying to poach
Matt since the beginning.

01:07:56.450 --> 01:07:57.800
- You sure that's what happened?

01:07:57.800 --> 01:07:59.530
- Of course, what else could it be?

01:07:59.530 --> 01:08:02.810
I blame that bastard Larry
more than I blame anybody.

01:08:02.810 --> 01:08:05.360
- So, you didn't try to
get yourself into the deal?

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:10.583
- Matt told you about that?

01:08:13.390 --> 01:08:15.779
Well, why would that have
anything to do with it?

01:08:15.779 --> 01:08:17.600
- I don't know what
that has to do with it.

01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.029
I just know that Matt's upset

01:08:19.029 --> 01:08:20.770
'cause he cannot get the chance.

01:08:20.770 --> 01:08:22.500
And didn't Larry call you in for that,

01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.040
so that Matt would have a shot?

01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:26.393
- Why is Matt coming to you with all this?

01:08:26.393 --> 01:08:28.149
- That's not
what we're talking about.

01:08:28.149 --> 01:08:29.620
- Is this guy coming after you?

01:08:29.620 --> 01:08:31.420
- Where is that coming from?

01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:33.093
- Is he coming after you?

01:08:33.093 --> 01:08:34.819
- Dad, I'm 19 years old.

01:08:34.819 --> 01:08:36.645
You gotta trust me to
make my own decisions.

01:08:36.645 --> 01:08:38.095
- Like your mother made hers?

01:08:40.460 --> 01:08:41.292
Honey, okay.

01:08:41.292 --> 01:08:42.210
I'm sorry about that.

01:08:42.210 --> 01:08:43.069
Stop.

01:08:43.069 --> 01:08:45.550
- I'm not her and he's not you.

01:08:45.550 --> 01:08:47.170
Just do the right thing by Matt.

01:08:47.170 --> 01:08:50.120
- Honey, I'm trying to do
the right thing for us!

01:08:50.120 --> 01:08:52.279
For you and me like always!

01:08:52.279 --> 01:08:54.984
- Oh, so that's what you've been doing.

01:08:54.984 --> 01:08:56.085
- What does that mean?

01:08:58.225 --> 01:08:59.809
What is that about?

01:09:01.135 --> 01:09:02.689
What the hell does that mean?

01:09:02.689 --> 01:09:04.173
- Just do the right thing.

01:09:08.229 --> 01:09:09.490
- Yeah, a message for Larry.

01:09:09.490 --> 01:09:10.850
Happy McBride.

01:09:10.850 --> 01:09:12.420
If you don't remember my name,

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:15.720
think back to when you built
the company on my back.

01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:17.350
You also might remember all the bribes

01:09:17.350 --> 01:09:19.350
and everything else I
kept my mouth shut about

01:09:19.350 --> 01:09:20.870
'cause that's what friends do.

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.130
And if you feel like calling me back,

01:09:22.130 --> 01:09:23.479
you should do that as well.

01:10:02.554 --> 01:10:04.210
- Hey, where are you?

01:10:04.210 --> 01:10:05.043
- In my van.

01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:06.017
What's up?

01:10:06.017 --> 01:10:08.943
- I want to do something
about this for both of you.

01:10:10.460 --> 01:10:11.780
- Mr. Cowley.

01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.061
Mr. Crowley, look who's here.

01:10:14.061 --> 01:10:14.894
- Ah.

01:10:14.894 --> 01:10:15.770
- Larry.

01:10:15.770 --> 01:10:16.603
Hey.

01:10:19.410 --> 01:10:20.243
- Nikki.

01:10:20.243 --> 01:10:21.076
- It's been too long.

01:10:21.076 --> 01:10:23.103
- Yes, you're a big Nikki.

01:10:25.839 --> 01:10:26.680
Matt.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:27.513
- Mr. Crowley.

01:10:31.210 --> 01:10:32.300
- Look, I know why you're here.

01:10:32.300 --> 01:10:33.600
I appreciate what you're trying to do,

01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:36.310
but the bottom line is there is no demand

01:10:36.310 --> 01:10:38.260
to see your dad fighting,
your manager fighting.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.423
It's just business.

01:10:46.605 --> 01:10:51.280
I don't know what you heard,
but I do not take bribes.

01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:53.623
- These are pre-sold tickets, Mr. Crowley.

01:10:54.460 --> 01:10:55.670
When I thought that you were gonna

01:10:55.670 --> 01:10:58.420
give us both a fight, I tweeted.

01:10:58.420 --> 01:11:01.160
Had people looking for
seats before they sold out.

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.093
So, I had them send me the cash.

01:11:04.090 --> 01:11:05.890
That's the bottom line, Mr. Crowley.

01:11:12.350 --> 01:11:13.854
- $2,000 here.

01:11:13.854 --> 01:11:14.774
A lot of money.

01:11:14.774 --> 01:11:17.674
- Of course, he's been all
over YouTube for like 10 years.

01:11:20.180 --> 01:11:21.013
- Eight.

01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.693
Okay.

01:11:25.570 --> 01:11:26.950
You both fight Saturday,

01:11:26.950 --> 01:11:29.830
but I don't know if you're
gonna be on the same card, okay?

01:11:29.830 --> 01:11:30.990
- Whatever works for you.

01:11:30.990 --> 01:11:33.200
- Uncle Larry, one more thing.

01:11:33.200 --> 01:11:35.630
We don't want him to know
it happened this way.

01:11:35.630 --> 01:11:37.260
- He values your friendship so much

01:11:37.260 --> 01:11:38.250
that it would mean more if--

01:11:38.250 --> 01:11:39.083
- Okay, okay.

01:11:39.083 --> 01:11:40.563
I get it, I get it.

01:11:40.563 --> 01:11:42.510
All right, I'm a busy man, okay?

01:11:42.510 --> 01:11:43.705
I gotta go.

01:11:43.705 --> 01:11:44.538
- See you, Larry.

01:11:44.538 --> 01:11:45.371
- All right.

01:11:45.371 --> 01:11:46.204
You gotta go.

01:11:46.204 --> 01:11:47.037
Maddie!

01:11:47.037 --> 01:11:47.870
Nikki's leaving!

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:50.523
Tell Johnson I'm upstairs!

01:11:57.150 --> 01:11:58.440
- Uppercut, right hand.

01:11:58.440 --> 01:11:59.370
Good.

01:11:59.370 --> 01:12:01.140
You good?
- Yeah.

01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:01.973
- What's up?

01:12:01.973 --> 01:12:03.420
- Hey, give me just a minute, okay?

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:04.253
Matt.

01:12:05.575 --> 01:12:07.240
Hey, man.

01:12:07.240 --> 01:12:08.617
- What's up, Hap?

01:12:08.617 --> 01:12:10.603
- You know, Nikki told me about.

01:12:12.040 --> 01:12:12.873
- Yeah, I know.

01:12:14.220 --> 01:12:15.053
- 11th hour.

01:12:18.010 --> 01:12:19.090
- I get it, Hap.

01:12:19.090 --> 01:12:19.923
- No, you don't.

01:12:23.670 --> 01:12:25.207
I wish I had some idea all the time,

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:26.523
but I don't get it either.

01:12:27.610 --> 01:12:29.080
I just know I gotta do this.

01:12:30.243 --> 01:12:31.433
I gotta do this now.

01:12:32.620 --> 01:12:33.720
- So, how do we do it?

01:12:35.810 --> 01:12:36.960
- I'll figure that out.

01:12:38.660 --> 01:12:40.170
You just need to know I'm sorry, you know,

01:12:40.170 --> 01:12:41.580
for what you have to--

01:12:41.580 --> 01:12:43.760
- Stop, you don't have to do that.

01:12:43.760 --> 01:12:44.700
It's fine.

01:12:44.700 --> 01:12:45.593
- All right.

01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:04.320
- Hey, what are you...

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:05.276
What, are you drunk?

01:13:05.276 --> 01:13:06.193
Get a room.

01:13:07.220 --> 01:13:08.053
- What?

01:13:09.580 --> 01:13:11.603
- Uh, I got this.

01:13:12.630 --> 01:13:14.090
Kitty, what's going on?

01:13:14.090 --> 01:13:16.140
- No more night left, Champ.

01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:17.420
- How is that possible?

01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:18.937
- What little money I had is gone.

01:13:18.937 --> 01:13:20.970
- When'd you
start paying for a room?

01:13:20.970 --> 01:13:23.493
- You told your fighter, too?

01:13:23.493 --> 01:13:25.460
What kind of bullshit that?

01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.500
- No, no.

01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:27.500
That's not what happened.

01:13:27.500 --> 01:13:29.960
He knows how much I care about you,

01:13:29.960 --> 01:13:32.880
so I'm sure that he assumed
you were just helping me out.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:33.713
Right?

01:13:35.780 --> 01:13:37.022
- No, that's not what happened.

01:13:37.022 --> 01:13:37.855
- Jesus.

01:13:39.743 --> 01:13:41.180
- Take things.

01:13:41.180 --> 01:13:42.870
You, him, happy time.

01:13:42.870 --> 01:13:43.930
- I have the money.

01:13:43.930 --> 01:13:45.370
You have the money.

01:13:45.370 --> 01:13:46.220
Just give her a couple of days.

01:13:46.220 --> 01:13:47.910
I'll get you back.

01:13:47.910 --> 01:13:48.743
- I can't.

01:13:48.743 --> 01:13:49.723
I don't have it either.

01:13:51.090 --> 01:13:53.513
- You had $2,000 two weeks ago.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:56.030
- Yeah, and it's gone.

01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.110
- You, him, happy time.

01:14:00.110 --> 01:14:01.220
Both bullshit.

01:14:01.220 --> 01:14:03.360
- You know what, Sue?

01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:04.920
You are bullshit!

01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:08.070
- No, you're bullshit, Champ.

01:14:08.070 --> 01:14:09.890
- You're double bullshit, Sue.

01:14:09.890 --> 01:14:11.928
- You're double bullshit to the roof.

01:14:11.928 --> 01:14:13.340
- You're bullshit--
- Bullshit.

01:14:13.340 --> 01:14:14.173
- Fucking infinity.

01:14:14.173 --> 01:14:15.540
- You go, okay?

01:14:15.540 --> 01:14:16.680
Take happy time.

01:14:16.680 --> 01:14:17.513
Go.

01:14:17.513 --> 01:14:18.490
- Yeah, you know what?

01:14:18.490 --> 01:14:20.163
Charge me a lost key fee here.

01:14:23.230 --> 01:14:25.530
I'm not even gonna ask you
what you did with that money.

01:14:25.530 --> 01:14:26.440
I'm not even gonna ask you.

01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:27.773
- Okay, well.

01:14:28.670 --> 01:14:29.743
- Now what?

01:14:34.517 --> 01:14:36.790
I'm not sleeping in a van.

01:14:36.790 --> 01:14:38.570
I'm not sleeping in a van, dude.

01:14:38.570 --> 01:14:39.403
- All right.

01:14:39.403 --> 01:14:41.270
- There's no way I'm
sleeping in the goddamn van.

01:14:41.270 --> 01:14:43.023
- Blender, great blender.

01:14:43.980 --> 01:14:44.813
Running water.

01:14:44.813 --> 01:14:47.570
The stove if you wanna whip something up.

01:14:47.570 --> 01:14:49.760
Fridge, excellent.

01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:51.323
TV, flat screen.

01:14:52.817 --> 01:14:53.650
Right.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.370
- Yeah?

01:15:00.370 --> 01:15:01.640
- Happy?

01:15:01.640 --> 01:15:02.473
- It is.

01:15:02.473 --> 01:15:04.780
- This is
Maddie over at Mr. Crowley's.

01:15:04.780 --> 01:15:06.130
He'd like to set a meeting.

01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:09.190
- That sounds great.

01:15:09.190 --> 01:15:11.753
- So, all bums, huh?

01:15:13.310 --> 01:15:15.630
- Come on, we both know
the truth about that.

01:15:15.630 --> 01:15:16.683
- And bribes?

01:15:19.410 --> 01:15:20.610
- I don't know anything.

01:15:21.820 --> 01:15:22.663
- You should.

01:15:24.190 --> 01:15:27.880
Seeing as my entire company
has been built on your back.

01:15:27.880 --> 01:15:30.273
- Larry, I'm sorry.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.520
- You're a loose cannon.

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:36.760
How am I gonna know
that you're not gonna...

01:15:38.470 --> 01:15:40.020
That there's no more surprises?

01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:46.273
- Larry, I swear to God,
I'll do whatever you say.

01:15:48.762 --> 01:15:49.762
- All right.

01:15:51.767 --> 01:15:53.103
You fight Saturday.

01:15:54.100 --> 01:15:55.120
- Really?

01:15:55.120 --> 01:15:55.953
Just like that?

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.663
That's great, man.

01:15:59.930 --> 01:16:01.310
What about Matt?

01:16:01.310 --> 01:16:02.990
- Happy you'd asked.

01:16:02.990 --> 01:16:03.960
Matt, uh...

01:16:03.960 --> 01:16:05.260
Matt fights Saturday, too.

01:16:08.510 --> 01:16:09.343
- Who'd we draw?

01:16:10.660 --> 01:16:11.493
- Each other.

01:16:12.350 --> 01:16:13.200
- Each other?

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:14.033
- You versus him.

01:16:14.033 --> 01:16:14.866
Think about that.

01:16:15.870 --> 01:16:18.130
- I don't have to think about that.

01:16:18.130 --> 01:16:21.960
- Aged and experienced
versus young and strong.

01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:23.973
But he's only had one fight.

01:16:24.915 --> 01:16:26.630
You know what that is?

01:16:26.630 --> 01:16:27.680
- Confusing?

01:16:27.680 --> 01:16:28.880
- Yes.

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:29.820
No one knows how to set those odds.

01:16:29.820 --> 01:16:31.163
You know what that is?

01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:33.920
- Embarrassing.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:34.900
- Big bets.

01:16:34.900 --> 01:16:36.250
Someone's gonna make a lot of money.

01:16:36.250 --> 01:16:37.083
- It's ridiculous.

01:16:37.083 --> 01:16:39.760
Nobody would ever believe
that that kid could beat me.

01:16:41.565 --> 01:16:43.665
- Hap, remember what you just promised me?

01:16:44.770 --> 01:16:45.943
- Yeah, I do.

01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:48.413
Yeah.

01:16:49.470 --> 01:16:51.371
I'm not doing it, though.

01:16:51.371 --> 01:16:52.210
I can't do that.

01:16:52.210 --> 01:16:53.043
- Okay.

01:16:54.460 --> 01:16:55.410
- I'm not doing it.

01:16:59.240 --> 01:17:00.670
I'm not doing it.

01:17:00.670 --> 01:17:01.503
- Okay.

01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:06.033
- Not happening.

01:17:07.473 --> 01:17:09.073
Well, that was hard even for me.

01:17:10.635 --> 01:17:12.220
- Are you sure you made it happen?

01:17:12.220 --> 01:17:13.520
- You're damn right I did.

01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.753
- Uh...

01:17:22.522 --> 01:17:23.355
Uh...

01:17:24.720 --> 01:17:26.040
Hap, I think there's a mistake.

01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:27.720
This says I'm fighting you.

01:17:27.720 --> 01:17:28.553
- No, no, no.

01:17:28.553 --> 01:17:30.150
That's not a mistake.

01:17:30.150 --> 01:17:32.200
This is even better than separate fights.

01:17:33.050 --> 01:17:34.220
- How the hell is this better?

01:17:34.220 --> 01:17:36.500
- Now, think about it.

01:17:36.500 --> 01:17:39.490
With separate fights, we could
both lose leading us nowhere.

01:17:39.490 --> 01:17:41.680
We fight each other, one of us has to win,

01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.880
can take care of the other down the line.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:43.730
- What?

01:17:43.730 --> 01:17:45.280
No.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:46.210
How dare he, Hap.

01:17:46.210 --> 01:17:47.140
This is crazy.

01:17:47.140 --> 01:17:48.220
Come on.

01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.960
How do I fight without a manager?

01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:51.420
- You scored there, too.

01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.040
You got Big Joe.

01:17:53.040 --> 01:17:54.160
I'll take Benny.

01:17:54.160 --> 01:17:55.200
We're good.

01:17:55.200 --> 01:17:56.400
- I get the guy we dissed?

01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:57.233
- He doesn't care.

01:17:57.233 --> 01:17:58.510
It's all business to him.

01:17:58.510 --> 01:18:00.280
He's got a deal with
Larry for his fighters,

01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.100
so he fills it with you.

01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.470
- And knowing that, you don't think he had

01:18:03.470 --> 01:18:05.010
something to do with it?

01:18:05.010 --> 01:18:06.355
- I'm sure he had
everything to do with it.

01:18:06.355 --> 01:18:07.280
Come on.

01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.120
- And you're still
willing to go through with this?

01:18:12.150 --> 01:18:13.550
- Sign it.

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:14.383
- No.

01:18:14.383 --> 01:18:16.133
There's so much wrong with this.

01:18:17.320 --> 01:18:18.393
- Look, Matt.

01:18:20.390 --> 01:18:21.940
I'll carry you, okay?

01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.730
We'll show your best game off.

01:18:23.730 --> 01:18:25.430
- It's not what I'm talking about.

01:18:28.230 --> 01:18:29.063
- Integrity.

01:18:29.063 --> 01:18:30.200
- There's nothing else.

01:18:30.200 --> 01:18:32.320
- There's everything else.

01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:34.260
You've only been allowed to have integrity

01:18:34.260 --> 01:18:36.543
because of the non-integrity
stuff that I do.

01:18:37.650 --> 01:18:38.483
You want an example?

01:18:38.483 --> 01:18:41.000
Take a good look at your
friend Owen rotting away.

01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.340
- I don't believe that.

01:18:42.340 --> 01:18:44.060
There's gotta be a better way, Hap.

01:18:44.060 --> 01:18:46.240
- There is no better way.

01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:47.650
It's the game you chose, man.

01:18:47.650 --> 01:18:49.548
This is the world we live in.

01:18:49.548 --> 01:18:51.290
What do you expect me to do against that?

01:18:51.290 --> 01:18:53.000
- I don't know!

01:18:53.000 --> 01:18:53.833
- Sign it.

01:19:11.280 --> 01:19:12.353
- Glad you called.

01:19:12.353 --> 01:19:13.730
I hope you're not gonna try to talk me

01:19:13.730 --> 01:19:15.100
into this fighting thing.

01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:17.060
- It shouldn't matter what I do, Dad.

01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:17.970
I just...
- Matt.

01:19:17.970 --> 01:19:20.300
- I want you to be happy with--

01:19:20.300 --> 01:19:23.110
- Matt, if this fighting
thing's not off the table,

01:19:23.110 --> 01:19:24.470
we don't have anything to talk about.

01:19:24.470 --> 01:19:25.380
- I don't think it's the fighting

01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:26.655
that you have a problem with.

01:19:26.655 --> 01:19:27.488
I mean--

01:19:27.488 --> 01:19:29.340
- I'll tell you the thing I
have the biggest problem with

01:19:29.340 --> 01:19:31.200
is you choosing something
the furthest thing

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.033
from a medical career.

01:19:32.033 --> 01:19:33.010
- Because it was the furthest thing away

01:19:33.010 --> 01:19:35.090
from something that you wanted, Dad.

01:19:35.090 --> 01:19:38.600
- Look, we can start over.

01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:39.480
- I'm not here to figure out

01:19:39.480 --> 01:19:40.790
the rest of my life with you, Dad.

01:19:40.790 --> 01:19:41.700
- Stop interrupting me again!

01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:43.683
Stop it, stop it!

01:19:45.620 --> 01:19:46.453
- Well, you know what?

01:19:46.453 --> 01:19:47.600
You're gonna be happy.

01:19:47.600 --> 01:19:51.180
I came here to tell you that
I was going back to school.

01:19:51.180 --> 01:19:52.013
- Great.

01:19:53.600 --> 01:19:55.910
We can start over again.

01:19:55.910 --> 01:19:56.743
- No, we can't.

01:19:58.570 --> 01:20:00.720
- Sure we can, son.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:02.000
Sure we can.

01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:03.633
- We'd have to go back 18 years.

01:20:06.840 --> 01:20:08.253
Say hi to Mom for me.

01:20:14.980 --> 01:20:16.823
- Oh, I see you're all nestled in.

01:20:19.247 --> 01:20:21.220
- What are the odds of this, huh?

01:20:21.220 --> 01:20:23.753
- If it happens, I'd say
three to one for you.

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:25.050
- With the odds-odds.

01:20:25.050 --> 01:20:26.450
I mean, what are the odds of you

01:20:26.450 --> 01:20:28.710
managing me against my own kid?

01:20:28.710 --> 01:20:30.390
- Oh that.

01:20:30.390 --> 01:20:31.236
Well.

01:20:31.236 --> 01:20:32.750
- What do you mean three to one?

01:20:32.750 --> 01:20:34.830
- Well, they would probably give you more

01:20:34.830 --> 01:20:37.430
because you know his every move.

01:20:37.430 --> 01:20:38.563
- It doesn't matter.

01:20:39.900 --> 01:20:41.800
I win and they won't give me nothing.

01:20:41.800 --> 01:20:44.120
- No, they would notice.

01:20:44.120 --> 01:20:45.850
Kid's got heat.

01:20:45.850 --> 01:20:48.964
Be worse for him no
matter how you look at it.

01:20:48.964 --> 01:20:49.860
- What do you mean worse for him?

01:20:49.860 --> 01:20:51.040
If he beat me.

01:20:51.040 --> 01:20:54.850
- If he beat you, he beat
some guy that nobody knows.

01:20:54.850 --> 01:20:56.830
He's no better off.

01:20:56.830 --> 01:20:59.900
If he loses to you, he
lost to some old guy

01:20:59.900 --> 01:21:03.800
that nobody knows and he's
worse than no better off.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:05.583
He can't win for losing, Happy.

01:21:06.632 --> 01:21:08.610
- You sure got a great way of
putting things there, Benny.

01:21:08.610 --> 01:21:10.780
- Yeah, I call it the way I see it.

01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.530
All right, I gotta get out of here.

01:22:34.053 --> 01:22:35.850
- Goodnight.

01:22:35.850 --> 01:22:36.683
- Nikki, wait.

01:22:50.190 --> 01:22:52.170
- Who do I have to kiss to get a coffee?

01:22:52.170 --> 01:22:53.003
- Jesus.

01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.800
- You sure about that?

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:24.633
- Are you?

01:23:33.944 --> 01:23:36.861
I'm gonna have to beat up your dad.

01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.240
- That's the spirit.

01:23:54.908 --> 01:23:56.825
Honey, we have to talk.

01:24:08.273 --> 01:24:11.130
- Listen, I know how you feel about Matt.

01:24:11.130 --> 01:24:11.963
- No, Honey.

01:24:11.963 --> 01:24:14.590
I need to talk to you about
what happened to your mom.

01:24:16.240 --> 01:24:17.890
- You're just saying this so I don't think

01:24:17.890 --> 01:24:18.820
she passed it down.

01:24:18.820 --> 01:24:19.710
- No.

01:24:19.710 --> 01:24:24.073
Now you know she gave
up everything for me.

01:24:26.251 --> 01:24:27.551
You know she lived for me.

01:24:29.750 --> 01:24:32.440
I hardly even came home.

01:24:32.440 --> 01:24:35.830
- But that wouldn't have
been enough for her to do it.

01:24:35.830 --> 01:24:36.663
- Jesus, Nikki.

01:24:36.663 --> 01:24:38.117
You don't remember.

01:24:38.117 --> 01:24:40.853
I used to come home, she'd
be curled up on the couch.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:48.387
She would try to hold herself together.

01:24:50.313 --> 01:24:51.200
I just...

01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:54.063
I used it as an excuse to train harder.

01:24:56.668 --> 01:24:57.780
- But that's why she left.

01:24:57.780 --> 01:24:59.940
You couldn't have been
the one who caused this.

01:24:59.940 --> 01:25:02.293
- Honey, she only left
to get my attention.

01:25:03.340 --> 01:25:06.710
- I can't remember feeling that
she wanted you to follow us.

01:25:06.710 --> 01:25:08.020
- Honey, she was counting on it.

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.263
She expected me to fix it.

01:25:12.130 --> 01:25:13.547
- Why didn't you?

01:25:14.490 --> 01:25:16.150
- I planned on it.

01:25:16.150 --> 01:25:17.233
I planned on it.

01:25:17.233 --> 01:25:20.470
I got a fight and I
thought she'll wait for me.

01:25:20.470 --> 01:25:22.550
She loves me more than anyone.

01:25:22.550 --> 01:25:23.383
She'll wait for me.

01:25:23.383 --> 01:25:24.260
Then I got another fight.

01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:26.840
- I know that you loved her, too.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:28.363
So, why would you do that?

01:25:29.223 --> 01:25:32.704
- I loved her more than
anything I've ever known

01:25:32.704 --> 01:25:33.643
except you, baby.

01:25:33.643 --> 01:25:34.476
I swear.

01:25:35.845 --> 01:25:36.777
- It's not that simple.

01:25:36.777 --> 01:25:39.777
- Honey, we both know it's not genetic.

01:25:51.300 --> 01:25:52.970
I know what's up, Joe.

01:25:52.970 --> 01:25:54.470
You got everything you wanted.

01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:56.493
- Not everything.

01:25:57.530 --> 01:25:59.910
Couldn't stop you from fighting.

01:25:59.910 --> 01:26:02.981
- Larry wouldn't do that to
me, not even for you, Joe.

01:26:02.981 --> 01:26:05.541
- Larry didn't give you this fight.

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:06.781
- How the hell am I sitting here?

01:26:06.781 --> 01:26:08.570
- You know what he's doing.

01:26:08.570 --> 01:26:10.090
Why even entertain this?

01:26:10.090 --> 01:26:11.450
- He's the one doing the entertaining.

01:26:11.450 --> 01:26:12.810
How, Joe?

01:26:12.810 --> 01:26:15.930
- You're here because of the
cash Matt and your kid put up

01:26:15.930 --> 01:26:18.070
for the seats they lied about selling.

01:26:18.070 --> 01:26:18.993
Go take a look.

01:26:20.030 --> 01:26:21.653
Front row, 50 empty seats.

01:26:22.590 --> 01:26:23.590
- That's impossible.

01:26:25.880 --> 01:26:26.780
That's impossible.

01:26:27.870 --> 01:26:28.703
You know...

01:26:29.640 --> 01:26:30.990
You know Matt, you know that kid.

01:26:30.990 --> 01:26:34.003
You know he wouldn't lie
to save his life, so.

01:26:35.370 --> 01:26:38.720
- Well, maybe you're growing on him.

01:26:38.720 --> 01:26:39.553
- Hey, come on.

01:26:39.553 --> 01:26:41.163
Get out of here, you mongrel.

01:26:43.990 --> 01:26:44.883
- How much?

01:26:47.760 --> 01:26:49.210
How much did Matt give Larry?

01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:52.503
- Not nearly enough for this.

01:26:53.840 --> 01:26:54.753
$2,000.

01:26:55.814 --> 01:26:57.647
- Ah, come on.

01:27:05.695 --> 01:27:06.612
- Son of a.

01:27:10.257 --> 01:27:12.110
- Happy, Happy, come on.

01:27:12.110 --> 01:27:13.820
He's just messing with your mind.

01:27:13.820 --> 01:27:15.140
- I need to see the kid.

01:27:15.140 --> 01:27:16.863
- Big Joe won't think that's a good idea.

01:27:16.863 --> 01:27:17.696
- Hey, come on.

01:27:17.696 --> 01:27:19.030
Hey, Joe.

01:27:19.030 --> 01:27:19.863
Joe!

01:27:21.630 --> 01:27:22.463
- What are you doing?

01:27:22.463 --> 01:27:24.186
You know the other room's off limits.

01:27:24.186 --> 01:27:25.706
- I just want to talk to Matt.

01:27:25.706 --> 01:27:27.266
- No, I can't let you in there.

01:27:27.266 --> 01:27:29.470
You know, what I told you was between us.

01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:30.666
Did I hurt your feelings?

01:27:30.666 --> 01:27:31.500
- Go on, get out of here.

01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:32.333
- Get Larry.

01:27:32.333 --> 01:27:33.859
- Hey, Matt!

01:27:33.859 --> 01:27:35.340
- Happy, Happy, come on.

01:27:35.340 --> 01:27:36.240
- Hap.

01:27:36.240 --> 01:27:38.550
- I told you to stay
away from my daughter!

01:27:38.550 --> 01:27:39.870
- Ooh, daughter.

01:27:39.870 --> 01:27:41.772
- I told you to stay away from her!

01:27:41.772 --> 01:27:44.090
I told you to stay away from my daughter!

01:27:44.090 --> 01:27:47.590
I wanna know the details,
every single thing you did.

01:27:47.590 --> 01:27:49.275
- Happy, Happy, come on.

01:27:49.275 --> 01:27:50.108
Come on, Hap.

01:27:50.108 --> 01:27:50.941
Jesus Christ.

01:27:50.941 --> 01:27:52.040
- I knew it was your daughter, Happy.

01:27:52.040 --> 01:27:53.276
She's got your DNA.

01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:55.620
Sucker!

01:27:55.620 --> 01:27:56.453
- Stop it!

01:27:57.306 --> 01:27:58.139
Matt!

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.789
I told you to stay away from her!

01:28:01.700 --> 01:28:02.790
- Jesus, what are you doing?

01:28:02.790 --> 01:28:03.880
- What are you doing?

01:28:03.880 --> 01:28:04.713
What are you doing?

01:28:04.713 --> 01:28:05.546
- Happy, no!

01:28:05.546 --> 01:28:06.379
- I told you to stay away from her.

01:28:06.379 --> 01:28:07.406
- Hap, ease up, buddy.

01:28:07.406 --> 01:28:08.656
Happy, ease up.

01:28:11.295 --> 01:28:12.385
Come on, bud.

01:28:12.385 --> 01:28:13.960
- Happy, come on.

01:28:13.960 --> 01:28:14.840
- Hap, Matt.

01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.240
- Knock it off.
- Matt, Matt, Matt.

01:28:16.240 --> 01:28:17.073
Come on, Matt.

01:28:17.073 --> 01:28:17.906
Off his neck.

01:28:17.906 --> 01:28:19.765
Easy, easy, easy.
- Come on.

01:28:19.765 --> 01:28:22.067
Goddamn it, what are you thinking?

01:28:22.067 --> 01:28:24.626
What, did you hurt your hand?

01:28:24.626 --> 01:28:25.653
Call a doctor.

01:28:26.510 --> 01:28:28.570
- It's a classic boxer's break.

01:28:28.570 --> 01:28:30.990
It's what they call an
impact induced fracture.

01:28:30.990 --> 01:28:33.280
- Just can't help yourself, can you, Hap?

01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:36.040
- Well, he's the one
who can't help himself.

01:28:36.040 --> 01:28:36.873
- Sorry, kid.

01:28:36.873 --> 01:28:38.320
We all lose.

01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:39.713
- No, wait a minute.

01:28:40.620 --> 01:28:42.230
Just put him with somebody else.

01:28:42.230 --> 01:28:43.950
- It's too late.

01:28:43.950 --> 01:28:45.740
- You got another guy?

01:28:45.740 --> 01:28:48.190
- No, he fought mine in
the last fight, remember?

01:28:50.420 --> 01:28:51.520
- My guy's right here.

01:28:52.982 --> 01:28:53.982
- Oh, Jesus.

01:28:55.110 --> 01:28:55.943
Wait a minute.

01:28:57.263 --> 01:28:59.410
The word I hear, that
Owen kid's a contender.

01:28:59.410 --> 01:29:00.360
- He's ready.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.310
- He do it?

01:29:01.310 --> 01:29:02.180
Same terms?

01:29:02.180 --> 01:29:03.470
- For you?

01:29:03.470 --> 01:29:04.373
Hell yes.

01:29:05.934 --> 01:29:06.934
- You good to fight?

01:29:07.840 --> 01:29:09.120
- I'm fine.

01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:10.170
- Skinny, go get him.

01:29:11.190 --> 01:29:12.023
- Come on, Doc.

01:29:12.023 --> 01:29:13.850
Let's go take care of the paperwork.

01:29:13.850 --> 01:29:14.813
- Good luck.

01:29:16.756 --> 01:29:18.940
- You never cease to amaze me, Hap.

01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.840
- You either, Lar.

01:29:21.630 --> 01:29:23.460
- Now you got a real shot, kid.

01:29:23.460 --> 01:29:24.460
- You gonna be okay?

01:29:24.460 --> 01:29:25.490
- Yep.

01:29:25.490 --> 01:29:26.450
- Don't beat him up any more.

01:29:26.450 --> 01:29:27.350
- I'll try.

01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:35.660
So...

01:29:35.660 --> 01:29:38.030
So, that shot was the point of all this?

01:29:38.030 --> 01:29:41.140
- Hey, how do you know it
wasn't about Nikki, hmm?

01:29:41.140 --> 01:29:42.080
- I'm pretty sure you
would've beaten me up

01:29:42.080 --> 01:29:43.400
the first time you saw us together.

01:29:43.400 --> 01:29:44.610
- That's true.

01:29:44.610 --> 01:29:47.663
- And you haven't exactly told
the truth since we've met.

01:29:49.550 --> 01:29:50.383
- Yeah.

01:29:51.460 --> 01:29:53.583
Well, you haven't lied
since we met either.

01:29:55.030 --> 01:29:55.863
Except to Larry.

01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:01.170
- You're not staying?

01:30:02.326 --> 01:30:04.240
- I gotta get up early and train.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:05.740
- Training with a broken hand?

01:30:09.769 --> 01:30:10.921
Of course.

01:30:19.463 --> 01:30:20.296
- Hey, Nik.

01:30:20.296 --> 01:30:21.129
Your dad's here.

01:30:29.754 --> 01:30:31.087
- What happened?

01:30:33.750 --> 01:30:37.730
- Tonight's big story, Happy
McBride already had his fight

01:30:37.730 --> 01:30:40.520
in the locker room with Bradford.

01:30:40.520 --> 01:30:44.480
And once again, Happy
McBride has defeated himself

01:30:44.480 --> 01:30:47.780
with his temper before taking
the first step into the ring.

01:30:47.780 --> 01:30:48.613
- You know, Bobby.

01:30:48.613 --> 01:30:49.980
I wish he broke his hand
before I had his fight.

01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:51.920
- Brian, I'm
sure 102 other fighters

01:30:51.920 --> 01:30:53.216
wish that exact same thing.

01:30:53.216 --> 01:30:54.049
- Do not romance him.

01:30:54.049 --> 01:30:56.200
You wanna take him home or
you wanna take him down?

01:30:59.165 --> 01:31:01.332
- I had him with one hand.

01:31:02.889 --> 01:31:05.050
- Good thing you didn't
hurt him worse then.

01:31:07.063 --> 01:31:07.983
- That's funny.

01:31:07.983 --> 01:31:09.066
That's funny.

01:31:20.360 --> 01:31:21.660
- Listen to me.

01:31:21.660 --> 01:31:23.370
Happy never told you that.

01:31:23.370 --> 01:31:24.417
Happy didn't care.

01:31:24.417 --> 01:31:26.231
I care about you, Matty.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:27.631
Come on, Matty.

01:31:27.631 --> 01:31:29.750
That's it, that's love.

01:31:29.750 --> 01:31:32.410
- Happy should be
happy the way The Doctor

01:31:32.410 --> 01:31:34.800
is operating on Tremaine.

01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:36.320
- Listen to me.

01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:37.690
Happy never told you that.

01:31:37.690 --> 01:31:38.950
Happy didn't care.

01:31:38.950 --> 01:31:40.580
I care about you, Matty.

01:31:40.580 --> 01:31:41.739
Come on, Matty.

01:31:41.739 --> 01:31:42.572
You got the heart.

01:31:42.572 --> 01:31:44.800
You got the heart Happy never had.

01:31:44.800 --> 01:31:45.770
You got heart, kid.

01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:46.810
Trust me.

01:31:46.810 --> 01:31:49.460
- And Bradford
is still all over him.

01:31:49.460 --> 01:31:50.919
- Tremaine obviously
didn't have enough time

01:31:50.919 --> 01:31:53.909
to prep for this fight, but he's.
