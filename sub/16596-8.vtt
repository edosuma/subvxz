♪♪

00:07.375 --> 00:09.174
You know what I love most
about California?

00:10.111 --> 00:11.377
The surfin'.

00:11.379 --> 00:14.880
And you'll love it even more
if you ever get in the water.

00:16.317 --> 00:19.752
Where fish make poopies? Pass.

00:21.288 --> 00:24.323
Ah, but I do love California.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.657
Destroying our house
in Stevens Point

00:25.659 --> 00:27.526
is probably the best thing
we have ever done.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.664
Whoa.

00:32.666 --> 00:34.299
-Parker: Hey, cheese queen.
<i>-(jovial music plays)</i>

00:34.301 --> 00:35.834
What's with all the Wisconsin?

00:35.836 --> 00:37.202
(scoffs)

00:37.204 --> 00:39.204
I am just watching
the live feed

00:39.206 --> 00:41.373
of the Cheddar-Brat Fest
in Stevens Point.

00:41.375 --> 00:44.476
Oh, I wish we were there.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.146
You'd rather be in Wisconsin

00:47.148 --> 00:48.547
rolling wheels of cheese

00:48.549 --> 00:52.818
than here in California
with the sun, the surf,

00:52.820 --> 00:55.421
the fish poop water?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.756
Look, California's great,
but it's just not home

00:57.758 --> 01:00.125
without a cheese-
and sausage-themed festival.

01:01.228 --> 01:04.396
But Mom,
California has everything.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.732
There has to be something
that you like.

01:06.734 --> 01:10.402
Well, I used to love
just sittin' on the deck,

01:10.404 --> 01:12.004
watching the pelicans.

01:12.006 --> 01:14.273
But then they moved
down the beach to roost,

01:14.275 --> 01:15.674
so I can't even do that anymore.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.009
Oh well.

01:17.011 --> 01:19.445
The boy next door flies a kite
shaped like a pelican, so

01:19.447 --> 01:21.747
(chuckles)
I'll just go watch him.

01:25.519 --> 01:26.785
-Wow.
-(door closes)

01:26.787 --> 01:28.921
Mom's got a major case
of the bum-skis,

01:28.923 --> 01:30.389
and it's kind of our fault.

01:30.391 --> 01:32.357
You know, one could
make the argument

01:32.359 --> 01:34.359
that it is entirely our fault.

01:35.296 --> 01:36.695
Yeah, you're right.

01:36.697 --> 01:38.030
We need to cheer Mom up.

01:39.266 --> 01:41.366
Oh, let's get
those pelicans back here

01:41.368 --> 01:42.301
so that Mom can watch them.

01:42.303 --> 01:43.535
How?

01:43.537 --> 01:45.904
Parker, pelicans
are wild animals.

01:45.906 --> 01:47.539
We can't just walk up
to them and be like,

01:47.541 --> 01:50.275
"Yo, pelican peeps,
do us a solid

01:50.277 --> 01:51.677
and come chill
on our beach."

01:54.281 --> 01:57.316
Challenge accepted!

01:58.285 --> 02:00.486
You know, I rarely know
what you mean by that,

03:03.317 --> 03:06.018
It's a slide for gerbils!

No, it's a woodblock

03:09.690 --> 03:11.957
You build little cars

Priya, I'm your friend,

03:21.068 --> 03:24.369
that your obsession
with rodents is disgusting.

03:25.673 --> 03:28.974
(gasps) The show must be doing
another woodblock derby episode

03:28.976 --> 03:31.510
like on the original
♪<i> Sing it Loud!</i> ♪

03:31.512 --> 03:34.813
It was a classic episode called
♪ Race it Loud! ♪

03:34.815 --> 03:37.583
I saw that.
It was girls versus boys.

03:37.585 --> 03:38.817
Oh, right!

03:38.819 --> 03:40.919
And the boys won

03:43.324 --> 03:44.590
You know what though?

03:44.592 --> 03:46.525
This time, I bet the girls win.

03:46.527 --> 03:48.760
And the cake will be
even bigger!

03:48.762 --> 03:50.329
Let's go find that cake!

03:51.432 --> 03:52.698
Oh, Zach, hey!

03:52.700 --> 03:53.732
I am so glad you're here.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.567
I actually have something
I want to ask you.

03:55.569 --> 03:58.670
Zach is the network exec
who helped develop the new show.

03:58.672 --> 03:59.771
He's actually the one who said

03:59.773 --> 04:01.406
that there should be
two exclamation points

04:01.408 --> 04:06.712
at the end of
♪<i> Sing it Louder!!</i> ♪

04:06.714 --> 04:09.047
Ask away, Liv Rooney,

04:09.049 --> 04:12.517
star of S-I-L-exclam-exclam!

04:12.519 --> 04:15.020

♪ Race it Louder! ♪

04:20.027 --> 04:21.793
I love when you sing the title!

04:21.795 --> 04:24.563
It really appeals to kids
ages eight to 14.

04:24.565 --> 04:25.430
(chuckles)

04:25.432 --> 04:27.532
Um, okay, so my question.

04:27.534 --> 04:29.768
-This time, do the girls win?
-(gasps)

04:29.770 --> 04:31.069
No!

04:31.071 --> 04:32.571
Get this!

04:32.573 --> 04:35.607
The boys win again,

04:35.609 --> 04:38.577
solidifying their domination!

04:38.579 --> 04:41.613
Boys 12 to 16,
pfft, gonna be stoked.

04:41.615 --> 04:43.615
Um, okay.

04:43.617 --> 04:45.584
Um, wouldn't it be
more fun though

04:45.586 --> 04:47.486
to switch it up and have
the girls win this time?

04:47.488 --> 04:51.657
Uh, well, we could do that,
but it's about cars,

04:51.659 --> 04:52.824
and girls aren't really
into cars.

04:52.826 --> 04:53.959
It's science

04:53.961 --> 04:55.160
and engineering.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.862
You know, guy stuff.

04:58.799 --> 04:59.998
Oh.

05:00.000 --> 05:02.067
"Guy stuff," wow. Um...

05:02.069 --> 05:05.337
Zach, that's...
really patronizing.

05:05.339 --> 05:08.674
I don't really know
what that word means,

05:08.676 --> 05:10.475
but I assume you're correct

05:10.477 --> 05:13.478
because vocabulary
is girl stuff.

05:18.919 --> 05:21.353
Welcome to Quesadilla Joe's.

05:21.355 --> 05:23.989
My name is Schnoop
and I will be your waiter.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.425
Yeah, um...

05:26.427 --> 05:28.493
Schnoop, you actually were
just here about five minutes ago

05:28.495 --> 05:30.362
and you have already
introduced yourself.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.596
(Willow and Maddie chuckle)

05:31.598 --> 05:34.666
I thought you looked familiar.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.435
Do you have any questions?

05:36.437 --> 05:40.138
Yeah. Um, how did
you get this job?

05:40.140 --> 05:42.607
Uh... (laughs)

05:42.609 --> 05:43.809
what she means is, uh,

05:43.811 --> 05:46.445
what's with all
those sombreros on the wall?

05:46.447 --> 05:48.347
That's the Habanero Hat Rack.

05:48.349 --> 05:49.681
Those are the names

05:49.683 --> 05:52.150
of peeps who won
our pepper eating contests.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.820
Eat five of the gnarliest
peppers on the planet,

05:54.822 --> 05:57.089
you get your name
on a tiny sombrero.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.625
Cool. Are you up there, Schnoop?

06:00.627 --> 06:02.194
No way, brah.

06:02.196 --> 06:05.263
I'm pretty hardcore,
but my mom said no.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.669
Well, we got two bowls of chips
and no pico de gallo.

06:10.671 --> 06:13.505
Care to, uh,<i> vamanos</i>
up to the salsa bar?

06:13.507 --> 06:14.706
<i>Si, señorita.</i>

06:18.879 --> 06:20.579
Hey, um...

06:21.749 --> 06:23.815
did you notice
that there are, like...

06:23.817 --> 06:26.752
no girls names up
on these sombreros?

06:27.688 --> 06:28.587
Whoa.

06:28.589 --> 06:31.356
You're right.
That's messed up.

06:31.358 --> 06:33.425
And you know
what I just decided?

06:33.427 --> 06:35.660
I am gonna be
the first girl to break

06:35.662 --> 06:37.696
the pepper challenge
gender barrier.

06:37.698 --> 06:39.398
Huh. Um...

06:39.400 --> 06:40.999
(scoffs) you're gonna
be the second

06:41.001 --> 06:43.235
'cause I'm gonna
be the first.

06:46.006 --> 06:48.440
Did you just step to me?

06:49.676 --> 06:52.611
Consider yourself stepped.

06:55.749 --> 06:57.616
Both:
May the best woman win!

06:57.618 --> 06:59.017
Both:
I will!

07:02.723 --> 07:04.055
So what you got cookin'?

07:04.057 --> 07:07.526
I am making synthetic
pelican pheromones.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.461
(chuckles)
Pheromones.

07:09.463 --> 07:10.629
Of course.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.768
Um, are you looking up
"pheromones"?

07:16.770 --> 07:18.036
(scoffs)

07:18.038 --> 07:19.571
Please.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.073
I know that pheromones are

07:22.075 --> 07:23.475
an odorless chemical

07:23.477 --> 07:25.410
secreted by an animal

07:25.412 --> 07:28.113
to attract
another animal of their...

07:29.116 --> 07:30.449
species.

07:31.718 --> 07:34.319
So did you make
the papier-mâché rock
I asked for?

07:34.321 --> 07:36.822
Oh, nobody mâchés

07:36.824 --> 07:39.791
like I mâché.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.727
Great, so we'll apply
the pheromones to the rock

07:42.729 --> 07:44.329
and hide it
close to our house.

07:44.331 --> 07:46.398
The pelicans will smell it
and be drawn right back
down the beach

07:46.400 --> 07:47.999
so Mom can watch
to her heart's content.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.470
Wait, we could have used
a real rock for that.

07:51.472 --> 07:53.071
Why'd you have me make
this stupid thing?

07:53.073 --> 07:55.974
Uh, because I needed
to keep you busy.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.709
I like a Munch-free workspace.

07:59.346 --> 08:00.679
You know, I get that.

08:07.087 --> 08:08.153
Hey.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.521
Oh, what a cute shoe.

08:09.523 --> 08:10.856
Why does it have wheels on it?

08:10.858 --> 08:13.091
Oh, it's what the girls are
racing in the episode.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.426
Zach gave it to us.

08:15.529 --> 08:16.761
Wait, what?

08:16.763 --> 08:18.797
Why? That's not even a car.

08:18.799 --> 08:20.632
It's better.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.033
It's a shoe car!

08:23.704 --> 08:25.637
(sighs) No.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.838
You sound just like Zach.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.540
He said that girls don't care
about cars.

08:28.542 --> 08:30.509
But girls don't care about cars.

08:31.478 --> 08:33.812
Okay, and why do
you feel that way?

08:33.814 --> 08:35.680
I mean, not all girls
like the same things.

08:35.682 --> 08:38.617
That's how it is
on TV and movies.

08:38.619 --> 08:40.385
That doesn't mean
that that's how it is!

08:41.321 --> 08:44.189
True. Every time you see
a rat on TV,

08:44.191 --> 08:46.324
people scream
like it's a monster.

08:46.326 --> 08:48.293
But I have a rat,

08:48.295 --> 08:51.530
and he's my little
snakey-tailed cutie pie.

08:53.066 --> 08:54.733
Yes. Thank you, Priya.

08:54.735 --> 08:57.769
That is a very unfair
stereotype... of rats.

08:59.640 --> 09:03.008
But, I mean,
there are tons of examples
of unfair stereotypes.

09:03.010 --> 09:04.242
And a lot of them really hurt,

09:04.244 --> 09:06.811
like that girls
can't be into cars

09:06.813 --> 09:08.713
or that they're only into shoes,

09:08.715 --> 09:11.550
or that their favorite color
is only ever pink.

09:11.552 --> 09:13.718
My favorite color is gray.

09:13.720 --> 09:15.520
That's what color
my pet rat is.

09:15.522 --> 09:17.489
She loves to cuddle
and give kisses.

09:17.491 --> 09:18.723
(kisses, giggles)

09:18.725 --> 09:21.259
Okay, that's the last time
I borrow your lip balm.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.564
If all we show is boys being
superior at, like,

09:25.566 --> 09:27.732
typical boy stuff,
then girls are gonna think

09:27.734 --> 09:30.168
that they can't do those things
or even like those things,

09:30.170 --> 09:32.938
and that's not right.

09:32.940 --> 09:35.874
How do you like
your shoe car, girls?

09:35.876 --> 09:40.278
You love it!
Tell me you love it...

09:40.280 --> 09:42.347
No, Zach.
We actually don't love it.

09:42.349 --> 09:46.918
Whoa, big thumbs down
from girls ages nine to 17.

09:47.788 --> 09:49.354
Does it need more sparkles?

09:49.356 --> 09:50.455
Brighter shade of pink?

09:50.457 --> 09:52.357
You know,
I really wouldn't hate it

09:52.359 --> 09:53.525
if someone added a rainbow.

09:53.527 --> 09:55.560
No, no. No.

09:55.562 --> 09:59.197
Zach, we want you
to change the script
so that the girls win.

09:59.199 --> 10:01.600
We're gonna stick
to the boys winning.
It's more realistic.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.702
Plus, look at their car!

10:03.704 --> 10:06.371
It's not even moving,
and it looks so fast!

10:07.441 --> 10:09.040
Zach, come on.

10:09.042 --> 10:11.476
I mean, girls can be into cars

10:11.478 --> 10:13.612
and mechanical stuff
and engineering.

10:13.614 --> 10:16.481
And be just as gross
in the bathroom.

10:16.483 --> 10:18.216
Equality!

10:19.252 --> 10:20.285
Yeah!

10:20.287 --> 10:22.487
Thank you, Ruby! That--

10:22.489 --> 10:23.888
You know, let's just stay
on topic though.

10:23.890 --> 10:25.256
Zach?

10:25.258 --> 10:27.459
-Uh-huh?
-What if we build our own car

10:27.461 --> 10:29.594
and we have an actual
woodblock derby race?

10:29.596 --> 10:31.329
Boys against girls.
And then whoever wins

10:31.331 --> 10:32.831
in real life gets to win
in the episode.

10:32.833 --> 10:36.668
Ooh, bloggers are
gonna eat that up.

10:36.670 --> 10:37.802
Let's do it!

10:38.805 --> 10:42.474
I can't wait to see
the shoe car you girls make!

10:52.586 --> 10:55.086
Betties and bros,
it's time to take on

10:55.088 --> 10:57.889
-the Habanero
Hat Rack challenge!
-(applause)

10:59.860 --> 11:00.925
Whew.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.961
You know what,
these peppers actually...

11:02.963 --> 11:04.696
don't even
really look that bad.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.431
They're kind of cute
hanging out on that plate

11:06.433 --> 11:07.866
next to that
eensy little rose.

11:07.868 --> 11:10.935
That's a tomato carved
to look like a rose.

11:10.937 --> 11:12.771
Kind of a hobby of mine.

11:12.773 --> 11:14.539
Oh.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.007
What's the milk for?

11:16.009 --> 11:18.977
It's the only thing that can
kill the burn of a pepper,

11:18.979 --> 11:21.646
but take a sip,
you lose the contest,

11:21.648 --> 11:23.748
and no tiny sombrero for you.

11:25.852 --> 11:27.452
All right, Willow,

11:27.454 --> 11:29.854
you are no longer
my friend today.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.056
You're the competition...

11:31.058 --> 11:33.291
and you're goin' down.

11:34.995 --> 11:37.962
(chuckles)
Willow doesn't go down.

11:39.833 --> 11:41.733
Let's pop some peppers!

11:41.735 --> 11:43.201
<i>-Arriba!</i>
-Whoo!

11:43.203 --> 11:45.003
-(applause)
-Willow: All right.

11:45.005 --> 11:46.871
-Okay.
-(inhales)

11:49.409 --> 11:50.742
(scoffs)

11:50.744 --> 11:52.343
(laughs)
These aren't bad.

11:52.345 --> 11:53.878
Yeah.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.613
These actually,
like, aren't spicy.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.550
Both:
Oh, mama!

11:59.553 --> 12:01.753
-Oh!
-Ow!

12:01.755 --> 12:05.290
That was the mildest
of all the peppers: El Blando.

12:07.527 --> 12:10.061
-Next up: The Tongue Stabber!
-What?

12:13.166 --> 12:16.935
All right, girls,
welcome to Liv's Garage.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.069
Today,

12:18.071 --> 12:19.721
we will be turning

12:19.722 --> 12:21.372
this little block of wood
into a super-fast,

12:21.374 --> 12:23.675
gravity-powered,
woodblock-derby-winning,

12:23.677 --> 12:25.343
stereotype-smashing
speed machine!

12:28.081 --> 12:29.514
Who here has used tools before?

12:32.419 --> 12:34.385
Nobody but me. All right.

12:34.387 --> 12:36.054
Oh, wait!

12:36.056 --> 12:37.122
Does a screwdriver count?

12:37.124 --> 12:40.492
-Yes!
-Sorry, but that's
still a no for me.

12:42.629 --> 12:43.728
-Liv?
-Yeah?

12:43.730 --> 12:45.130
You know how to use
all these tools?

12:45.132 --> 12:46.731
Yes, actually.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.266
My friend Andie
back in Wisconsin

12:48.268 --> 12:50.268
even taught me
how to use a blowtorch.

12:50.270 --> 12:53.972
So, do not judge a book by
its very well-manicured cover.

12:55.108 --> 12:56.808
Let's build a car! Whoo!

12:56.810 --> 12:57.942
(all chuckle)

13:04.117 --> 13:05.950
Oh, stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop!

13:17.297 --> 13:18.863
Liv:
Push, push!

13:19.900 --> 13:20.965
Hey...

13:21.902 --> 13:22.967
Yeah!

13:32.846 --> 13:35.146
(Liv squeals)

13:48.328 --> 13:50.929
I can't believe
we made that car.

13:50.931 --> 13:53.031
I love car stuff.

13:53.033 --> 13:55.500
Me too, and I never
would have thought so.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.268
I guess I was just
so fooled into thinking

13:57.270 --> 13:59.838
there are things girls like
and things boys like.

13:59.840 --> 14:01.372
Thanks for making us
give it a try, Liv.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.641
You know what, girls?

14:03.643 --> 14:05.777
I really think that
we are going to win this race

14:05.779 --> 14:08.847
and we are going to
crush this stereotype.

14:08.849 --> 14:10.081
(sighs)

14:11.351 --> 14:13.418
We still need
a little bit more weight.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.789
Like the weight
of a tiny plastic rat?

14:21.061 --> 14:22.126
Both:
Fine!

14:23.797 --> 14:25.196
You're in, Betsy!

14:27.400 --> 14:28.733
Liv:
Oh!

14:28.735 --> 14:31.236
-Yes!
-That was perfect!

14:34.040 --> 14:36.374
-(pelicans squawking)
-Joey, we did it!

14:36.376 --> 14:38.376
There's a whole flock
of pelicans outside the house!

14:38.378 --> 14:39.611
The pheromones worked!

14:47.087 --> 14:51.055
Why is there a pelican
in our house?

14:51.057 --> 14:52.423
Meet Peggy.
(chuckles)

14:52.425 --> 14:54.392
And don't call her Margaret.
She hates that.

14:56.062 --> 14:57.562
How did this happen?

14:57.564 --> 15:00.098
Um, remember
when you said to put

15:00.100 --> 15:02.166
one drop of pheromones
on the rock?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.835
I did that. Yay!

15:03.837 --> 15:06.137
And then I sneezed
and spilled the rest
of the bottle on myself.

15:08.174 --> 15:09.774
Joey, we need to
get it out of here

15:09.776 --> 15:11.009
before Mom gets back.

15:11.011 --> 15:12.043
I know. I tried.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.611
But she follows me everywhere.

15:13.613 --> 15:14.846
Even to the bathroom.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.015
By the way,
it is impossible to go

15:17.017 --> 15:20.084
when you have got
a giant pelican
staring right at ya.

15:21.288 --> 15:23.254
Of course she's not gonna leave.

15:23.256 --> 15:25.256
You smell like
the hottest pelican
at pelican prom!

15:28.128 --> 15:30.228
Sounds like somebody's jealous.

15:30.230 --> 15:32.030
Want me to see
if Peggy has a sister?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.264
No! Munch, be serious!

15:33.266 --> 15:35.767
Okay, we need a plan
to get this thing out of here.

15:35.769 --> 15:37.135
Okay, just relax.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.370
We'll figure it out
before Mom comes home.

15:39.372 --> 15:40.872
There's no need to freak out.

15:40.874 --> 15:42.206
Karen:
Boys, are you home?

15:42.208 --> 15:44.142
Okay, now we freak out!

15:51.117 --> 15:53.952
Okay, um, I will go
into the kitchen to stall Mom,

15:53.954 --> 15:55.453
and you lead Peggy
out the front door.

15:55.455 --> 15:56.721
Okay, better plan,

15:56.723 --> 15:58.256
you go into the kitchen
and stall Mom,

15:58.258 --> 16:01.192
I lead Peggy
out the front door
like a boss.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.329
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

16:04.331 --> 16:06.397
Just get that pelican
out of this house.

16:06.399 --> 16:07.899
Yeah.

16:09.970 --> 16:13.805
Hey, Mom...

16:13.807 --> 16:15.573
Parker, have you been outside?

16:15.575 --> 16:18.509
They're back!
My pelicans are back!

16:18.511 --> 16:19.844
They missed me!

16:19.846 --> 16:21.980
Ooh! I'm gonna get
my camera with the zoom lens.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.248
They're cute,
but you don't want
to get too close.

16:24.250 --> 16:25.850
Wait! Mom, don't go in there.

16:25.852 --> 16:28.319
-Why?
-(Peggy squawks)

16:28.321 --> 16:29.354
What was that?

16:29.356 --> 16:33.324
Uh, I knew how much
you missed the pelicans,

16:33.326 --> 16:37.295
so I have been working on my...

16:37.297 --> 16:39.364
pelican impressions.

16:40.533 --> 16:44.235
(squawks)

16:45.972 --> 16:47.338
Pretty good, huh?

16:47.340 --> 16:50.475
You would do that for me?
You are so sweet.

16:50.477 --> 16:51.809
(Peggy squawks)

16:51.811 --> 16:53.511
You are so busted.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.313
What is going on?

16:55.315 --> 16:56.381
(screams)

17:01.321 --> 17:03.721
Mom, this is Peggy.

17:03.723 --> 17:06.891
Joey, you were supposed to
get her out of the house.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.893
Uh, she doesn't want to leave.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.462
(chuckles) She's a stubborn
old gal, aren't you, Peggy?

17:11.464 --> 17:13.364
Okay, okay,

17:13.366 --> 17:16.267
why is there a pelican
in the house?

17:17.203 --> 17:19.203
We felt bad that
you were so homesick,

17:19.205 --> 17:21.539
so we thought that
if we brought the pelicans back,

17:21.541 --> 17:23.408
you'd be happy, but...

17:23.410 --> 17:26.377
things did not turn out
how we wanted.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.379
Definitely not.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.382
Are you mad?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.484
Oh, how can I be mad

17:33.486 --> 17:36.087
when this comes
from such a good place?

17:36.089 --> 17:37.555
You know,
I am always amazed

17:37.557 --> 17:39.490
by how simultaneously touched

17:39.492 --> 17:41.259
and annoyed I am
by you two.

17:42.695 --> 17:45.430
Parker, you go down to the docks
and get some fish heads.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.598
We'll use those
to lead her out of the house

17:47.600 --> 17:51.002
and I'll stay here and make sure
that she doesn't peck at Joey...

17:51.004 --> 17:53.204
too much.
(chuckles)

17:53.206 --> 17:56.441
Aww. But... will you take
a video if she poops on him?

17:56.443 --> 17:57.909
Uh, yeah.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.110
Now go.

18:02.849 --> 18:04.415
(Willow and Maddie
breathe heavily)

18:04.417 --> 18:05.917
All right!

18:05.919 --> 18:09.454
Maddie and Willow have finished
their fourth pepper!

18:09.456 --> 18:12.090
(Willow and Maddie
breathe heavily)

18:12.092 --> 18:15.593
I can't feel anything
from my nose down.

18:15.595 --> 18:18.229
I don't know.

18:18.231 --> 18:19.931
Are my feet still on me?

18:19.933 --> 18:23.434
All right, you're down
to the last pepper.

18:23.436 --> 18:25.636
-(both groan)
-A pepper that is so hot,

18:25.638 --> 18:27.438
it has no name.

18:27.440 --> 18:29.707
It is known only as...

18:29.709 --> 18:32.677
-(screams)
-(both scream)

18:35.281 --> 18:37.982
All right. Come on, Mad Dog.

18:37.984 --> 18:39.250
You can do this.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.384
Don't touch that!

18:41.321 --> 18:42.820
That pepper is so hot,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.289
it has to be placed
directly onto your tongue.

18:45.291 --> 18:47.325
You almost burned off
your fingerprints.

18:47.327 --> 18:48.493
(gasps)

18:52.966 --> 18:54.332
Okay! All right,
Maddie, you win!

18:54.334 --> 18:56.734
-I gotta drink the milk.
-No, no, no, no!

18:56.736 --> 18:58.102
You can't quit.

18:58.104 --> 19:00.905
-Why not?
-Because Willow doesn't go down!

19:00.907 --> 19:02.473
(sighs)

19:02.475 --> 19:05.977
Let's finish this and break
the pepper gender barrier
together.

19:08.248 --> 19:09.914
Thank you, Maddie.

19:09.916 --> 19:13.417
I'd cry, but my tears
have all evaporated.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.621
All right.

19:16.623 --> 19:18.422
Get ready to feel this one

19:18.424 --> 19:21.359
all the way down
to your toenails.

19:24.864 --> 19:28.199
-(yelps)
-(muffled screaming)

19:28.201 --> 19:29.500
Willow:
No, no, no!

19:29.502 --> 19:31.102
(muffled grunting)

19:37.010 --> 19:38.743
-(cheers and applause)
-We have two winners!

19:40.046 --> 19:44.215
That's two more sombreros
on the Habanero Hat Rack!

19:44.217 --> 19:46.617
(cheers and applause)

19:50.390 --> 19:52.790
(gulps)
We did it!

19:52.792 --> 19:56.127
(gulps) It's like
I licked the sun!

19:56.129 --> 19:57.762
(both breathe heavily)

20:01.801 --> 20:03.201
Okay, whoever wins this race

20:03.203 --> 20:04.969
wins the race
on our episode of

20:04.971 --> 20:06.671
♪<i> Sing it Louder!!</i> ♪

20:06.673 --> 20:09.140
♪ Yeah, yeah, yeah ♪

20:11.211 --> 20:13.477
That's right,
Zach can sing too!

20:15.548 --> 20:17.415
Hey, Zach,
check out our car.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.517
Girls ages eight to 100

20:19.519 --> 20:20.551
say, "Boo-yah!"

20:21.988 --> 20:24.055
Whoa, sick!

20:24.057 --> 20:26.224
I guess girls
can be into cars.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.393
What's that sound?

20:29.395 --> 20:31.896
A little door in my brain
opening up to new ideas.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.836
Okay, girls, win or lose,
I just really want to
let you know

20:38.838 --> 20:41.505
that I am very proud of you
for not being afraid

20:41.507 --> 20:42.940
to tackle this stereotype.

20:44.544 --> 20:46.377
Let's race!

20:46.379 --> 20:48.346
Girls versus boys!

20:48.348 --> 20:50.715
Ready, set...

20:50.717 --> 20:51.782
go!

21:10.803 --> 21:12.637
-(girls cheer)
-Girls!

21:16.876 --> 21:19.543
Thank you, Headmaster Katoonis.

21:19.545 --> 21:20.711
See, girls?

21:20.713 --> 21:23.447
Don't let anybody tell you
that there's boy stuff

21:23.449 --> 21:26.617
and girl stuff 'cause
really there's just stuff.

21:32.792 --> 21:34.458
Have you told
Stephanie the real reason

21:34.460 --> 21:35.993
you're at Monahan Academy?

21:37.063 --> 21:38.429
No way.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.665
I can't tell her
my secret yet.

21:40.667 --> 21:43.067
She's not ready.

21:43.069 --> 21:44.835
I'm not sure I am either.

21:46.072 --> 21:48.339
(dramatic music plays)

21:52.679 --> 21:55.846
Attention, ladies
and sombrer-bros,

21:55.848 --> 21:59.917
I give you two more members
of the Habanero Hat Rack Club!

21:59.919 --> 22:01.719
(cheers and applause)

22:04.624 --> 22:07.325
I still can't feel my tongue,
but it was totally worth it!

22:08.494 --> 22:11.128
Go ahead.
Hang your hats on the wall.

22:11.130 --> 22:13.097
Um... (chuckles)

22:13.099 --> 22:16.367
first, I think we would both
like to say a few things.

22:16.369 --> 22:18.035
-(chuckles)
-Uh, okay.

22:18.037 --> 22:21.706
No one's ever done that before,
but life's a journey.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.544
Today...

22:26.546 --> 22:28.512
we stand on the shoulders

22:28.514 --> 22:30.681
of the giants
who came before us.

22:30.683 --> 22:32.049
Yes.

22:32.051 --> 22:35.786
It is with great pride
and humility that we become

22:35.788 --> 22:37.655
the fist women
to hang our hats

22:37.657 --> 22:38.723
on the Habanero Hat Rack.

22:39.992 --> 22:42.727
(chuckles)
What are you talking about?

22:42.729 --> 22:44.729
Like, half the names
up there are girls.

22:44.731 --> 22:48.199
-(both scoff)
-Okay, no.

22:48.201 --> 22:49.967
Like Max...

22:51.137 --> 22:52.703
-Chris, Terry...
-Yeah.

22:52.705 --> 22:55.539
Uh, Jordan, Pat, Alex--

22:58.010 --> 23:00.578
Both:
Oh...

23:01.748 --> 23:03.981
Those are also girls names.

23:09.021 --> 23:12.490
This does not
diminish our glory!

23:12.492 --> 23:14.225
Both:
Bam! What?

23:14.227 --> 23:16.761
-Yeah!
-Whoo! Whoo!

23:16.763 --> 23:18.596
Parker:<i> Will you take a video</i>
<i>if she poops on him?</i>
