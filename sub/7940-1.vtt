02:32.280 --> 02:36.569
Good morning, everyone.
Here's the 8:35 weather and the news.

02:37.800 --> 02:41.660
Right now, it's 29 degrees
and clear in midtown Manhattan.

02:41.760 --> 02:45.100
Expect passing snow showers this morning,
clearing by midday.

02:45.200 --> 02:46.725
Highs in the lower 30s.

02:47.520 --> 02:51.860
Three NYPD officers are being
treated for gunshots this morning.

02:51.960 --> 02:55.123
All three were shot in
the span of an hour last night.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.086
Two officers were shot on the subway.

03:23.680 --> 03:25.648
- You ready?
- Yeah.

03:27.320 --> 03:28.845
You look very nice.

03:30.920 --> 03:32.046
Thanks.

03:32.920 --> 03:35.161
- You sure about this?
- Yeah.

03:39.120 --> 03:40.849
Morning. Morning.

03:42.280 --> 03:43.770
Hey, handsome.

03:55.240 --> 03:56.730
- Thank you.
- All right.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.846
Okay.

04:00.440 --> 04:01.965
Don't do anything stupid.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.700
We don't have any more money left.

04:04.800 --> 04:06.450
What else could I possibly do?

04:12.400 --> 04:13.481
Hey, stop.

04:14.040 --> 04:15.849
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey! Hey!

04:19.640 --> 04:21.060
Get out!

04:21.160 --> 04:23.660
Get the fuck out of the truck!

04:23.760 --> 04:25.620
Let's go! Let's go!

04:25.720 --> 04:27.245
- Go, go, go!
- Come on!

05:02.600 --> 05:06.366
I woke up this morning
feeling very good about this.

05:08.200 --> 05:09.531
Really?

05:12.280 --> 05:14.740
You've been telling me
not to do this for two years.

05:14.840 --> 05:17.161
Now that we're all in, I'm loving it.

05:34.440 --> 05:37.125
Yep. There we are.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.242
My people have gone over your books.

05:50.480 --> 05:53.086
I know this is a great deal
of money for you.

05:53.800 --> 05:57.220
So why are you on us
so long for... for this...

05:57.320 --> 06:00.563
this polluted, dirty piece of earth?

06:02.240 --> 06:04.925
I imagine I want it
for the same reason you did.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.242
I'm in the garment business,
so I take that as a testament.

06:10.280 --> 06:14.140
But I inherited this property
from my uncle.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.500
Sadly, he had no children of his own.

06:16.600 --> 06:20.241
He was the one that let them
put these tanks up here.

06:20.760 --> 06:24.128
So, you see, this place...
can do nothing for me.

06:24.680 --> 06:28.321
I offered to lease this site
to you for a very fair price.

06:29.080 --> 06:31.780
- But you're not interested.
- No.

06:31.880 --> 06:33.405
Why is that?

06:33.880 --> 06:35.609
I like to own the things I use.

06:37.600 --> 06:39.125
I can see that.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.281
So?

06:46.120 --> 06:47.281
Yes.

06:48.520 --> 06:50.660
Mr. Walsh has reviewed
the contract fully?

06:50.760 --> 06:51.940
Of course.

06:52.040 --> 06:54.780
- You brought the money?
- Yes.

06:54.880 --> 06:58.123
You know you have only 30 days
to close the transaction?

06:59.120 --> 07:02.180
No extensions.
No contingencies whatsoever.

07:02.280 --> 07:03.740
I understand.

07:03.840 --> 07:07.481
You fulfill the terms of the contract,
property is yours.

07:07.960 --> 07:10.700
If you cannot, we keep the money...

07:10.800 --> 07:13.380
and we sell the property
to your competitor...

07:13.480 --> 07:16.529
who has been after us
almost as badly as you have.

07:19.000 --> 07:23.801
I like you, but you should know
that the only reason we choose you...

07:23.920 --> 07:26.940
is because of the favorable conditions
of the contract.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.540
Yes.

07:28.640 --> 07:30.449
- And once you sign the...
- I understand.

07:34.080 --> 07:38.580
Well, show us... the money,
and, then I'll sign the papers.

07:38.680 --> 07:40.170
Here it is.

07:44.320 --> 07:46.500
Another case exactly like it.

07:46.600 --> 07:47.806
Right here.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.682
- Mazel tov.
- Mazel tov.

08:18.400 --> 08:20.900
- Congratulations.
- It's not ours yet.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.686
Hey. It was a hell of a job
getting them to this point.

08:25.280 --> 08:27.487
This is a good day for us.

08:29.720 --> 08:32.340
Why don't you take a walk around?

08:32.440 --> 08:34.442
Enjoy it for a second.

09:35.560 --> 09:37.289
They probably broke his jaw.

09:40.200 --> 09:41.725
Are you all right?

09:44.880 --> 09:45.961
Shit.

09:47.200 --> 09:48.700
Have the police been here yet?

09:48.800 --> 09:52.122
Well, he was left on the side of the highway
without a truck. They brought him here.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.970
Can you speak?

09:57.520 --> 09:58.681
SÃ­.

10:00.200 --> 10:02.282
- Can I talk to you outside?
- Yeah.

10:15.040 --> 10:16.610
Did they sign the contract?

10:17.840 --> 10:19.330
- Yes.
- And took the deposit?

10:20.000 --> 10:21.460
Oh, yeah.

10:21.560 --> 10:23.449
- So it's a go.
- It's a go.

10:23.560 --> 10:26.211
- Congratulations.
- Thank you. You too.

10:28.000 --> 10:29.843
All right. We got 30 days.

10:34.680 --> 10:36.603
These fucking guys.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.700
This poor kid.
He's been working his ass off.

10:40.800 --> 10:42.540
You want me to talk
to my brother about it?

10:42.640 --> 10:46.980
No, no. Do not talk to your brother
or your father about this.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.889
- All right?
- Okay.

10:49.000 --> 10:51.500
- But this can't continue.
- Well, it won't.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.180
I'm gonna go speak with the DA tomorrow.

10:53.280 --> 10:55.931
Oh, fuck the DA.
He's not interested in helping us.

10:57.800 --> 10:59.529
It's not fair to them.

11:01.440 --> 11:03.522
- You're at war here.
- No, we're not.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.120
- Really? Because they are.
- Well, I'm not.

11:13.480 --> 11:15.060
You gonna check on the new house?

11:15.160 --> 11:16.844
Yeah, I'll see you back home.

11:35.080 --> 11:36.620
Do you need anything else?

11:40.600 --> 11:41.806
Okay.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.606
I'll be here to pick you up
when you get out.

11:47.640 --> 11:48.641
Thank you.

11:52.600 --> 11:54.523
These men are cowards.

11:56.440 --> 12:00.240
They're too weak to make a living
or even fight with their own hands.

12:02.600 --> 12:05.331
And too stupid to think
of anything else to do.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.660
So, you guys have done
what you needed to?

12:41.760 --> 12:44.286
- Yeah.
- And what was that?

12:44.920 --> 12:46.580
I'm sorry?

12:46.680 --> 12:49.500
Well, you just said you've done
what you needed to do.

12:49.600 --> 12:52.060
So, what is it that you've done?

12:52.160 --> 12:55.020
I'm not exactly sure, you know.
I just got here at 4:00.

12:55.120 --> 12:56.940
My shift's actually up, so...

12:57.040 --> 12:58.280
Right.

13:00.320 --> 13:01.845
So, you've done nothing?

13:10.840 --> 13:12.365
Hey, why'd they want it?

13:13.960 --> 13:17.203
They wanted the $6,000
worth of fuel that was in it.

13:30.680 --> 13:33.206
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road.

13:34.560 --> 13:37.404
Thirty to 33 are just about ready to go.

13:39.520 --> 13:43.161
Nick, the gasket's good.
You should get over there and get going.

14:13.080 --> 14:14.740
Andrew, sorry to keep you waiting.

14:14.840 --> 14:16.205
Mr. Lawrence.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.460
- Thanks for seeing us at the last minute.
- Of course.

14:20.560 --> 14:24.690
And Mr. Morales. I didn't realize
you were coming as well.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.689
- Yes.
- So, what can I do for you?

14:27.400 --> 14:30.340
- We need your help.
- In what way?

14:30.440 --> 14:32.980
Our trucks, they're being robbed.

14:33.080 --> 14:34.980
As much as I'd like
to be able to help you...

14:35.080 --> 14:37.401
you know this is a police issue...
it's not what we do here.

14:37.520 --> 14:41.500
But this is turning into
an urgent problem for us.

14:41.600 --> 14:43.460
Our drivers are scared to death.

14:43.560 --> 14:45.289
I'm not sure I understand.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.123
There were more murders and rapes in this
city last year than there have ever been.

14:49.240 --> 14:52.767
So if you've come to tell me that we have
an urgent security issue here...

14:53.720 --> 14:54.820
trust me, I'm aware.

14:54.920 --> 14:57.924
My people are at risk
just driving around in this city.

14:58.760 --> 15:00.500
Just trying to do their jobs.

15:00.600 --> 15:01.601
And I...

15:04.960 --> 15:07.340
I've done everything
that you've asked of me.

15:07.440 --> 15:11.460
It's been two years since you started
investigating my company.

15:11.560 --> 15:14.980
And since then, I've spent
thousands of dollars hiring lawyers...

15:15.080 --> 15:19.500
to provide you with every piece of
information that your office has requested.

15:19.600 --> 15:23.082
And I expect that you've been asking
the same of my competitors.

15:24.080 --> 15:26.860
So with all this information
that you've gained...

15:26.960 --> 15:28.900
we're just asking...

15:29.000 --> 15:31.765
do you have any idea
who's been doing this to us?

15:33.160 --> 15:34.650
I don't.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.980
As you know, we've been investigating
industry-wide corruption in your business...

15:39.080 --> 15:41.060
that seems
to have been going on for years.

15:41.160 --> 15:43.020
So you're right.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.804
That means you're all
stealing from each other...

15:44.920 --> 15:47.900
which as far as I can tell
is just a refreshing new take...

15:48.000 --> 15:50.220
on what you've been doing to your customers
and fellow taxpayers...

15:50.320 --> 15:52.129
for the last 15 years.

15:54.520 --> 15:58.580
First, please know that we respect
the work that you're doing...

15:58.680 --> 16:00.900
to try to help our business
and the city.

16:01.000 --> 16:04.209
But also know that I have never
taken anything from anyone.

16:05.080 --> 16:06.650
So when you say that we've...

16:08.120 --> 16:09.884
We're on the same side here.

16:10.760 --> 16:12.683
Well, yes and no.

16:14.960 --> 16:17.100
You know...

16:17.200 --> 16:19.680
Mr. Morales, you seem like a decent man.

16:21.200 --> 16:24.260
And because of that, I don't really
feel comfortable sitting here...

16:24.360 --> 16:27.762
pretending like the elephant perched
on the corner of my desk isn't there.

16:29.240 --> 16:32.180
So, you know,
I can't go into specifics right now...

16:32.280 --> 16:36.340
but we believe that you and your company
have broken the law...

16:36.440 --> 16:38.060
and that we have evidence to prove that.

16:38.160 --> 16:42.210
So next week we will be
bringing a case against you.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.620
It's a little awkward, obviously...

16:44.720 --> 16:47.700
but, I didn't want to have
this happen next week...

16:47.800 --> 16:49.300
not having said
something here in person.

16:49.400 --> 16:51.004
You know, out of respect.

16:52.760 --> 16:54.444
You have your job to do.

16:55.440 --> 16:56.930
But know that you're wrong.

16:57.720 --> 17:00.883
And we will take advantage
of every opportunity to prove that.

17:07.599 --> 17:08.601
Abel.

17:11.079 --> 17:12.127
Abel!

17:14.839 --> 17:16.001
Exactly.

17:17.640 --> 17:20.099
Let's not overreact.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.740
We don't even know what this is yet.

17:21.839 --> 17:24.940
We haven't seen any charges.
It could be bullshit.

17:25.040 --> 17:28.089
His office might be toying with us.
Right now it's nothing.

17:30.240 --> 17:31.651
I know.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.045
Hey. How'd it go?

17:49.080 --> 17:51.940
The DA says he's gonna
bring down charges on us next week.

17:52.040 --> 17:54.180
What? Why?

17:54.280 --> 17:55.805
We don't know yet.

17:56.440 --> 17:57.965
Look, it might be nothing.

17:59.040 --> 18:02.726
But I need to know,
where are we exposed?

18:04.880 --> 18:07.690
We follow standard industry practice
on every front.

18:09.720 --> 18:13.247
- What does that mean?
- You know what it means.

18:15.520 --> 18:17.010
Anna.

18:18.320 --> 18:20.322
I need to know
what they're saying we did.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.500
Murder in a Brooklyn schoolyard.

18:32.600 --> 18:37.128
And the hunt is on tonight for a gunman
who shot and killed a teenage student.

18:42.040 --> 18:43.121
Well.

18:44.080 --> 18:46.900
- Look who's here.
- Arnold.

18:47.000 --> 18:49.048
Just a touch off the side, Jimmy.

18:49.560 --> 18:52.180
We can't all be as lucky
as Mr. Morales here...

18:52.280 --> 18:54.362
in terms of keeping our hair.

18:55.160 --> 18:57.740
- You're a good-looking man.
- Thanks, Vinny.

18:57.840 --> 18:59.524
I know I am.

19:00.640 --> 19:03.166
So I hear congratulations are in order.

19:04.520 --> 19:05.965
What's that?

19:06.080 --> 19:08.560
You got yourself in contract over there.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.220
Well, we're working on it.

19:12.320 --> 19:15.220
Thirty-day close? You better be.

19:15.320 --> 19:18.688
We are. Thanks for your concern.

19:24.200 --> 19:28.046
I saw a couple of your trucks
over in Rego Park the other day.

19:28.640 --> 19:29.721
Really?

19:30.400 --> 19:32.004
When was that?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.405
A couple times.

19:38.280 --> 19:40.647
- It's possible.
- Is it?

19:43.600 --> 19:44.886
Yes.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.780
- It's a tough market.
- It is.

19:47.880 --> 19:51.248
My father struggled for years
before he broke in there.

19:53.760 --> 19:57.128
Any new market is a tough one. See ya.

20:27.400 --> 20:28.640
Babe.

20:29.240 --> 20:30.660
- Look.
- Everything all right?

20:30.760 --> 20:33.161
- It's done.
- It is.

20:34.120 --> 20:35.610
I love it.

20:37.480 --> 20:38.980
What do you think, girls?

20:39.080 --> 20:40.500
- It's really cool.
- It's amazing.

20:40.600 --> 20:43.860
- You like it?
- I love it. I really like the door.

20:43.960 --> 20:45.620
- You like? The color?
- You want that room?

20:45.720 --> 20:48.291
Whoa. Really cool.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.327
- What's... What's he doing?
- I don't know.

21:05.040 --> 21:06.405
Hey!

21:16.680 --> 21:18.205
It's okay. It's all right.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.883
Hey! Hey!

22:36.880 --> 22:38.405
Come back here!

22:46.520 --> 22:49.444
Come here! Come here, you fuck!

23:01.920 --> 23:03.490
Where did you go?

23:06.800 --> 23:07.961
Abel?

23:10.440 --> 23:12.442
- It's okay. Come on.
- Oh, my God.

23:13.360 --> 23:14.850
Lot of help you were.

23:16.040 --> 23:17.041
Come on.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.810
- Ow.
- Who was it?

23:27.680 --> 23:29.420
What do you mean, "Who was it"?

23:29.520 --> 23:31.522
How am I supposed to know who it was?

23:32.760 --> 23:34.250
I don't know.

23:34.880 --> 23:37.247
It's probably some punk
trying to rip us off.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.060
No. If you're not gonna be honest...

23:43.160 --> 23:45.540
No, look. If he wanted
to send a message or something...

23:45.640 --> 23:47.860
he could've... I don't know what...
and he didn't.

23:47.960 --> 23:50.167
To me, it seems like a message was sent,
loud and clear.

23:50.280 --> 23:53.489
Baby, please don't...
please don't get going on this.

23:54.240 --> 23:55.844
We're a big, new house.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.168
He probably just wanted the TV.

24:04.320 --> 24:06.060
He didn't have anything on him.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.650
Just some kid.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.642
Alarm's gonna be in on... Wednesday.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.570
I chased him away.

24:16.920 --> 24:18.410
He's not coming back.

24:25.840 --> 24:26.841
Okay?

24:29.560 --> 24:30.561
Okay.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.643
Now, you do this and only this.

24:45.600 --> 24:47.523
You look down at the cloth.

24:48.520 --> 24:50.045
You don't say a word.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.602
You just stare down at the cloth...

24:52.720 --> 24:56.930
and very slowly
just start shaking your head.

24:58.760 --> 25:02.003
Then after sitting in silence way longer
than feels comfortable...

25:03.200 --> 25:05.771
you turn... and you say...

25:07.320 --> 25:09.100
"I would love to run
a few numbers for you.

25:09.200 --> 25:11.362
Is there somewhere
more comfortable we could sit?"

25:12.520 --> 25:14.940
Now, they're almost always gonna take you
to the dining room table.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.580
And they're gonna offer you something.

25:16.680 --> 25:19.900
Whatever it is,
always take the fancy option.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.340
- Can I get you a coffee or a tea?
- I would like a tea, please.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.740
We have some homemade lemonade
or a soda.

25:25.840 --> 25:27.968
I would love a lemonade, thank you.

25:28.920 --> 25:29.980
Why?

25:30.080 --> 25:33.500
Because we're never gonna be
the cheapest option.

25:33.600 --> 25:35.340
So we have to be the best.

25:35.440 --> 25:38.460
And they want... No.

25:38.560 --> 25:41.540
They need to feel
that you want the best too.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.820
That's why our trucks
are the newest or the cleanest.

25:44.920 --> 25:46.729
And our drivers are approachable.

25:47.840 --> 25:49.820
Now, after you've done the math...

25:49.920 --> 25:52.500
and you've shown them how much
they can save over the long haul...

25:52.600 --> 25:54.060
through proper maintenance...

25:54.160 --> 25:56.003
you need to get them to sign.

25:57.040 --> 25:59.380
But the problem is, by hiring you...

25:59.480 --> 26:01.540
they need to fire someone else.

26:01.640 --> 26:03.340
And that's never easy.

26:03.440 --> 26:07.650
So after you show them the number...

26:08.760 --> 26:13.243
you look up at them and stare.

26:17.280 --> 26:19.123
Stare longer than you should.

26:33.200 --> 26:34.725
This is not a joke.

26:37.040 --> 26:40.806
You will only keep this job if you close,
and that's not funny to you.

26:42.160 --> 26:44.060
I'm only interested
in this company growing...

26:44.160 --> 26:46.811
and when it isn't,
it's not very funny to me at all.

26:48.800 --> 26:52.220
These people work very hard
for their money.

26:52.320 --> 26:54.220
And these other guys
are ripping them off...

26:54.320 --> 26:56.800
treating them poorly
because they don't know.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.340
So when you look them in the eye...

27:01.440 --> 27:05.140
you have to believe that we are better.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.765
And we are.

27:09.240 --> 27:12.528
But you will never do anything as hard
as staring someone straight in the eye...

27:13.600 --> 27:15.170
and telling the truth.

27:25.640 --> 27:27.210
Well, it was great to meet you.

27:28.920 --> 27:32.129
Welcome, and I wish you luck.

27:50.360 --> 27:52.044
- You ready?
- Sure.

28:05.960 --> 28:08.620
If there's anything you need,
anything at all...

28:08.720 --> 28:10.688
don't hesitate to call the office.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.289
I'm sorry this happened to you.

28:21.440 --> 28:23.204
See you soon.

28:26.240 --> 28:27.765
Abel. Abel.

28:31.280 --> 28:33.647
Do you think I'm ready
to move into sales?

28:37.480 --> 28:39.528
No, I don't.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.445
- I don't think I'll be able to...
- You will.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.889
Get some rest.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.606
Catherine?

29:03.080 --> 29:05.970
Catherine. Catherine! Katie!

29:10.000 --> 29:12.651
Where did you get this? Catherine?

29:13.240 --> 29:15.500
- Tell me where you found this.
- Here in the yard.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.489
Show me! Where?

29:19.720 --> 29:21.210
Go on.

29:23.120 --> 29:25.860
- It was just sitting right here behind...
- Did you see this?

29:25.960 --> 29:28.420
Well, yeah, she went under there
to get that ball and came out with it.

29:28.520 --> 29:30.420
- Maria!
- Is it real?

29:30.520 --> 29:32.727
- Are we in trouble?
- Maria!

29:34.720 --> 29:40.020
Caused by the drift of soft silt
from the sides of the...

29:40.120 --> 29:42.500
Hey, Debbie. Can you give us a moment?

29:42.600 --> 29:43.681
Sure.

29:53.200 --> 29:55.680
- What is that?
- It's a gun.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.687
It's a fucking gun.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.485
Where did you get that?

30:03.520 --> 30:06.364
Your youngest daughter found it
in the bushes outside our front door.

30:07.000 --> 30:08.700
She was playing with it.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.725
Look. It's loaded. With the safety off.

30:14.360 --> 30:17.220
It wasn't some kid looking
to take our TV.

30:17.320 --> 30:21.848
It was a fucking goon with a loaded gun
looking in our window.

30:23.880 --> 30:25.370
I'll take care of it.

30:26.360 --> 30:29.045
What does that mean
when you say you'll take care of it?

30:30.560 --> 30:32.900
It's not a brick through a car window...

30:33.000 --> 30:37.005
or another of the cute little warnings
over the past few years.

30:37.880 --> 30:40.326
This is your kid playing
with a loaded gun.

30:40.440 --> 30:42.602
I know what it is!

30:46.720 --> 30:48.245
Let me deal with it.

30:51.400 --> 30:52.890
Oh, you better.

30:54.880 --> 30:57.850
You're not gonna like
what'll happen once I get involved.

31:12.960 --> 31:14.485
Don't do this.

31:17.760 --> 31:19.000
I won't.

31:26.800 --> 31:29.280
I, need to talk to you both.

31:32.240 --> 31:34.049
I found a gun outside our front door.

31:35.440 --> 31:36.930
Somebody left it there last night.

31:37.040 --> 31:38.883
- Who?
- We don't know who.

31:40.200 --> 31:41.611
Jesus.

31:44.360 --> 31:45.771
So...

31:46.440 --> 31:49.410
It's not good. It's bad.

31:49.960 --> 31:52.860
The DA's coming down
with charges tomorrow.

31:52.960 --> 31:55.940
- Oh, my God.
- It's a 14-count indictment.

31:56.040 --> 31:58.281
Three counts I would consider serious.

31:58.800 --> 32:00.220
They know how the industry works...

32:00.320 --> 32:04.006
so they're gonna charge us with rigging
scales and underreporting income.

32:05.280 --> 32:07.806
We've just pushed it a little too far,
that's all.

32:08.360 --> 32:11.170
Let's look at it like a badge of honor.

32:11.880 --> 32:14.850
We're big enough now
they even give a shit about us.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.060
You need to go home right away...

32:17.160 --> 32:19.580
and start going through
our set of books.

32:19.680 --> 32:21.460
How far back are they going?

32:21.560 --> 32:24.450
I would imagine when you bought
the business from Anna's father.

32:25.360 --> 32:26.885
I'll get into it.

32:27.640 --> 32:30.020
One other thing. The bank.

32:30.120 --> 32:32.940
I need you two to sit down with them.
I set up a dinner.

32:33.040 --> 32:37.380
I want you both there.
Just be up front. Be honest.

32:37.480 --> 32:39.140
I don't anticipate a problem.

32:39.240 --> 32:42.180
God knows they've given money
to bigger crooks than us.

32:42.280 --> 32:44.169
Jesus. All right.

32:51.960 --> 32:54.281
- How are you, Bill?
- I'm okay.

32:54.960 --> 32:57.540
I can't say I'm used to making house calls
like this anymore though.

32:57.640 --> 32:59.100
Well, I would've come to see you.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.726
That's all right.
You got bigger things to worry about.

33:02.840 --> 33:04.205
So...

33:05.600 --> 33:08.020
I can't have this situation
with your guys continuing.

33:08.120 --> 33:09.724
- My guys.
- Your drivers.

33:09.840 --> 33:11.842
Yes, yes. Well, good, good.

33:12.560 --> 33:16.260
I would love for you to help with this,
because I can't have it continue either.

33:16.360 --> 33:20.100
So let them protect themselves.
That would stop all this very quickly.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.100
I respectfully disagree.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.820
They're picking on your men
because they're just sitting there weak.

33:25.920 --> 33:29.242
They're taking shots at me
because I'm growing, expanding.

33:29.360 --> 33:31.249
I'm getting stronger, not weaker.

33:31.360 --> 33:33.727
I can't have my drivers
getting hit like this anymore.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.620
It looks like I can't protect them.

33:36.720 --> 33:38.404
Well, it appears that you can't.

33:41.200 --> 33:44.204
You seem to be under
a lot of pressure from all sides.

33:44.680 --> 33:46.580
Which I understand.

33:46.680 --> 33:50.127
Trust me. I understand that. So...

33:52.040 --> 33:53.565
Let me think this through.

33:54.760 --> 33:58.560
But whatever decision
I come to, it stands.

33:59.640 --> 34:04.089
Those men show up every morning for you
because I tell 'em to.

34:05.280 --> 34:07.460
You have to realize...

34:07.560 --> 34:10.404
that these are dangerous times
and we have to adapt.

34:11.360 --> 34:13.761
It's not like when we was driving.

34:17.280 --> 34:19.089
No. No, it's not.

34:57.840 --> 34:59.365
So how did it go?

35:00.320 --> 35:01.685
Not well.

35:02.800 --> 35:04.620
He feels very strongly about it.

35:04.720 --> 35:06.245
I can see that.

35:07.400 --> 35:09.528
I don't think he fully understands.

35:13.000 --> 35:15.048
What is there to understand?

35:16.080 --> 35:17.445
Well...

35:21.040 --> 35:23.700
Well, first of all, it's illegal.

35:23.800 --> 35:26.167
It's not illegal if I say it isn't.

35:27.400 --> 35:29.740
My responsibility is to provide...

35:29.840 --> 35:33.140
safe and timely passage
of goods and products...

35:33.240 --> 35:35.163
into and around this city.

35:35.960 --> 35:37.900
And because of this situation...

35:38.000 --> 35:41.620
it is appearing to those
whose opinions I care about...

35:41.720 --> 35:43.370
that I can't do my job.

35:44.200 --> 35:46.965
That cannot and will not continue.

35:47.600 --> 35:50.340
Well, I'm not even sure
what you're suggesting.

35:50.440 --> 35:53.205
- Are you kidding me with this?
- No.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.886
Every driver in your fleet
gets a handgun.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.420
- And a permit.
- Mm-hmm.

36:00.520 --> 36:03.364
- When?
- By Friday.

36:04.680 --> 36:06.489
Are the permits legit?

36:06.600 --> 36:08.602
Well, it depends
on what they do with it.

36:09.320 --> 36:12.060
If they kill their wife with them, then no,
then that is a very fake permit...

36:12.160 --> 36:14.100
and I'll walk away very quickly.

36:14.200 --> 36:20.048
But they just need to show that they're
defending themselves, and it'll stop.

36:21.720 --> 36:25.008
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

36:25.720 --> 36:29.122
I don't fucking know.

36:32.640 --> 36:34.165
Thank you.

36:36.720 --> 36:38.006
Hey.

36:39.240 --> 36:40.924
Check out this machine.

36:42.760 --> 36:46.162
I was paying a guy five bucks an hour
to do this with me last year.

36:48.400 --> 36:50.528
- Peter.
- Yeah?

36:51.240 --> 36:52.810
I need to speak with you.

36:54.240 --> 36:55.980
Oh, I see that.

36:56.080 --> 37:01.484
Look, I know you've been dealing with a few
of your rigs getting picked off as well.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.441
But this has all gotten
way out of control.

37:06.480 --> 37:08.801
There was a guy with a gun at my house
the other night.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.887
My wife and children
were home at the time.

37:13.600 --> 37:15.125
Is everyone okay?

37:18.280 --> 37:20.044
Yeah. I managed to chase him off.

37:28.160 --> 37:29.685
What can I do?

37:31.560 --> 37:33.562
I need to know who's doing this.

37:36.080 --> 37:37.100
Abel...

37:37.200 --> 37:41.060
It... It's one thing
to go after my trucks and my drivers...

37:41.160 --> 37:42.980
and to steal from me.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.605
This is different.

37:45.640 --> 37:47.688
Have you ever had to deal
with anything like this?

37:49.000 --> 37:52.500
A bunch of thugs invaded my home
when I was a baby.

37:52.600 --> 37:56.740
Nothing happened.
They were trying to scare my father.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.380
They ended up just leaving,
and we never found out who it was.

37:59.480 --> 38:05.328
But after that,
we moved to a fortress just like this.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.407
And those guys who let you in?

38:10.280 --> 38:12.806
They're here to shoot anyone
who isn't invited.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.260
Yes, well, I refuse to live
my life that way.

38:16.360 --> 38:18.089
I won't do it.

38:19.720 --> 38:21.484
I want more than this.

38:22.400 --> 38:23.890
I know you do.

38:28.040 --> 38:30.122
My father's in jail, as you know.

38:30.920 --> 38:34.925
And I always wanted to conduct myself
differently than he did.

38:35.040 --> 38:36.530
And you have.

38:37.360 --> 38:39.362
Almost exclusively, yes.

38:41.120 --> 38:42.963
I know why he did what he did.

38:44.200 --> 38:45.690
'Cause at the time it's easier.

38:46.520 --> 38:48.045
But it's not.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.725
Yes, it is.

39:08.040 --> 39:09.724
Where is he now?

39:10.720 --> 39:12.460
I just dropped him off at the hospital.

39:12.560 --> 39:14.340
He seems fine.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.090
I think you should come on in.

39:18.320 --> 39:19.845
Hey.

39:19.960 --> 39:21.450
I'm on my way back.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.602
They just got another truck.

39:26.400 --> 39:27.686
I know.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.290
Who was driving?

39:30.080 --> 39:31.570
Leo.

39:31.680 --> 39:33.170
Is he all right?

39:34.480 --> 39:35.925
Yes.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.928
You know, drivers' security aside...

39:41.040 --> 39:45.100
this shit is having a significant
financial effect on this company.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.060
It... It can't continue.

39:47.160 --> 39:48.491
Oh, I know.

39:49.960 --> 39:53.700
How was your talk?
I spoke with him afterward.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.643
I said I wouldn't do it.

40:01.440 --> 40:03.807
I don't think we're in a position
to say that.

40:04.720 --> 40:06.580
What's that?

40:06.680 --> 40:08.780
Why don't you take a walk with me?
Come on.

40:08.880 --> 40:11.611
Are you serious with this? Is this...
Is this... This is what it's come to?

40:12.520 --> 40:15.205
We have to walk around outside
like we're fucking gangsters?

40:17.120 --> 40:20.283
I am, and it is.

40:30.800 --> 40:33.121
It looks like we must do this.

40:34.280 --> 40:36.886
- We must?
- Yeah. They'll shut us down.

40:37.400 --> 40:40.500
The... These men, they work for me.

40:40.600 --> 40:43.180
The trucks they drive,
the customers they serve...

40:43.280 --> 40:45.760
it's all here because I built this.

40:45.880 --> 40:48.804
That's true. Until it isn't.

40:49.920 --> 40:52.740
The last guy in the world
that we want problems with...

40:52.840 --> 40:55.571
is the head of the fucking Teamsters.

40:55.680 --> 40:58.740
We're out of business in a month
if they tell these guys to walk.

40:58.840 --> 41:00.260
We don't have the cash.

41:00.360 --> 41:03.020
It will be the end of everything
that we have worked for.

41:03.120 --> 41:07.540
If one of these guys shoots someone,
they're gonna bring me down for it.

41:07.640 --> 41:09.165
I'm not gonna do it.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.325
I'll talk to him.

41:12.840 --> 41:15.340
We need to close this deal.

41:15.440 --> 41:17.420
We cannot stay like this any longer.

41:17.520 --> 41:19.900
We have to close on that property.

41:20.000 --> 41:22.048
We're so weak right now.

41:26.680 --> 41:29.251
Why do you want this so badly?

41:32.000 --> 41:34.606
Because I've got my entire savings
at risk on this deposit.

41:34.720 --> 41:37.020
No, no, no, no.
I don't mean the deposit.

41:37.120 --> 41:40.442
I mean... this. Why do you want it?

41:40.560 --> 41:42.210
Have you ever thought about it?

41:43.040 --> 41:47.100
Yes, I've thought about it. I've thought
about it every day for the last five years.

41:47.200 --> 41:50.540
That place has just been sitting
right across that fence mocking me.

41:50.640 --> 41:52.460
I'm not talking about that place.

41:52.560 --> 41:55.245
I-I-I just meant... everything.

41:56.520 --> 41:58.204
Why do you want it so much?

42:00.000 --> 42:01.764
I have no idea what you mean.

42:06.120 --> 42:07.724
- Arthur.
- Anna.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.900
- You look as lovely as always.
- Thank you.

42:11.000 --> 42:13.500
Gentlemen, do you know Ian Thompson?
One of our new VPs.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.489
- Ian.
- Hello, Ian.

42:16.200 --> 42:18.567
You're good? Good.

42:22.080 --> 42:23.820
All right.

42:23.920 --> 42:25.500
- I'm hungry.
- Yeah.

42:25.600 --> 42:27.100
What can I get you to drink?

42:27.200 --> 42:29.740
A lot. Wine list, please.

42:29.840 --> 42:31.365
I'll be right back.

42:32.480 --> 42:34.881
So, how are you?

42:36.000 --> 42:38.446
We've been better. But we're good.

42:38.960 --> 42:40.460
Yes, I heard about that.

42:40.560 --> 42:43.962
If you stay in business long enough,
it's bound to happen eventually.

42:44.080 --> 42:45.730
Well, that's exactly right, Arthur.

42:46.440 --> 42:48.740
And that's why we wanted
to sit down with you tonight...

42:48.840 --> 42:51.100
and be up front about everything
that's going on...

42:51.200 --> 42:53.500
make sure you understand
the nature of the complaints...

42:53.600 --> 42:56.180
and that, even in a worst...
case scenario...

42:56.280 --> 42:58.420
we'll move forward
with very comfortable capital on hand.

42:58.520 --> 43:00.660
Yes, but you should know, Arthur...

43:00.760 --> 43:03.300
that this man has been
digging through our industry...

43:03.400 --> 43:06.260
looking for anything he can find,
for the last two years now.

43:06.360 --> 43:11.180
And the thought that he would
single us out... it's ridiculous.

43:11.280 --> 43:12.805
Thank you.

43:13.640 --> 43:16.700
I run a fair and clean business...

43:16.800 --> 43:18.820
and we follow every standard
industry practice.

43:18.920 --> 43:21.700
And I will fight
to my last breath to prove that.

43:21.800 --> 43:23.860
But don't think for a moment...

43:23.960 --> 43:26.725
that I'm gonna let this mess
interfere with our plans to grow.

43:27.680 --> 43:29.808
And we need to know
that you're standing with us.

43:30.600 --> 43:31.931
Yes.

43:32.440 --> 43:36.001
What is it about this property
that makes you feel it's so integral...

43:36.800 --> 43:40.964
that you can't put it off until after
all these legal matters are settled?

43:44.280 --> 43:46.328
That's a very good question.

43:47.320 --> 43:49.482
This property gives us many things.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.849
First, access to the river...

43:52.520 --> 43:56.500
so I can bring in my fuel directly
from any provider in the world...

43:56.600 --> 43:58.060
straight to my tanks.

43:58.160 --> 44:02.006
Second, it has over 10 million gallons
of storage capacity...

44:02.640 --> 44:05.780
so I can buy in the summers
when the price is low...

44:05.880 --> 44:08.260
and sell to my customers
and, more importantly, my competitors...

44:08.360 --> 44:09.850
when the price is high.

44:10.480 --> 44:14.690
I will no longer just drive trucks.
I will control my fate.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.202
But the real answer to your question...

44:18.920 --> 44:22.163
is that when it feels scary
to jump, Ian...

44:22.720 --> 44:24.529
that is exactly when you jump.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.371
Otherwise, you end up staying
in the same place your whole life...

44:28.880 --> 44:30.723
and that I can't do.

44:33.040 --> 44:34.980
We've always been there with you...

44:35.080 --> 44:39.085
and know... that we will continue to be.

44:39.960 --> 44:41.540
- Good.
- Thanks, Arthur.

44:41.640 --> 44:43.608
- That's great.
- I don't think we have to eat.

44:46.600 --> 44:48.409
That went really good.

44:50.120 --> 44:52.088
Arthur's a good man.

44:55.480 --> 44:57.403
They're gonna close.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.330
Of course.

45:08.600 --> 45:11.080
Shit. Are you okay?

45:11.840 --> 45:13.660
- You all right?
- What the...

45:13.760 --> 45:15.444
What the fuck was that?

45:16.200 --> 45:17.725
It was a deer.

45:18.600 --> 45:21.080
- It's still alive.
- Shit.

45:22.920 --> 45:25.940
- You've got to put it out of its misery.
- Oh, Jesus.

45:26.040 --> 45:29.220
I mean it. You can't leave it like that.

45:29.320 --> 45:30.401
Goddamn it.

45:41.400 --> 45:42.686
Shit.

46:09.200 --> 46:11.806
- Is it dead?
- No.

46:12.520 --> 46:14.820
- Well, you need to...
- I know.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.082
- What are you doing?
- I'm getting the tire iron.

47:25.120 --> 47:27.726
Hi, Maria. So sorry we're late.

47:31.440 --> 47:34.364
- The girls okay?
- Oh, yes. All is good.

47:51.880 --> 47:53.860
You can go home now.
We'll see you in the morning.

47:53.960 --> 47:55.371
Okay.

48:23.920 --> 48:25.570
- What?
- What?

48:26.960 --> 48:28.849
Yeah? What?

48:30.440 --> 48:32.260
Okay, Anna.

48:32.360 --> 48:34.260
What's with the gun?

48:34.360 --> 48:38.540
I told you I wasn't gonna continue
to stand around...

48:38.640 --> 48:40.802
and let these people
come and get me and my children.

48:41.360 --> 48:42.860
So unlike you...

48:42.960 --> 48:46.540
who seems to be completely comfortable just
standing around like some fucking pussy...

48:46.640 --> 48:48.324
I decided to do something about it.

48:49.640 --> 48:51.324
Where did you get it?

48:53.200 --> 48:54.660
You know where I got it.

48:54.760 --> 48:56.569
And do you have a permit?

48:59.280 --> 49:00.340
Not yet.

49:00.440 --> 49:04.340
Then you must be a bigger fucking idiot
than I even thought.

49:04.440 --> 49:06.283
You wanna protect your children?

49:07.000 --> 49:08.900
Protect them?

49:09.000 --> 49:11.300
Do you have any idea
what happens to you...

49:11.400 --> 49:13.641
If they catch you using that thing?

49:16.160 --> 49:17.740
You dress yourself up
in these fancy clothes.

49:17.840 --> 49:19.340
And look at you here in your mansion.

49:19.440 --> 49:22.220
I've given you everything
you could possibly ask for...

49:22.320 --> 49:23.780
and you still can't help acting...

49:23.880 --> 49:27.180
like this little Brooklyn corner-store
gangster's daughter that you are.

49:27.280 --> 49:29.500
Are you delusional?

49:29.600 --> 49:33.020
Do you really understand
how ridiculous that makes...

49:33.120 --> 49:34.860
- Abel.
- I wanna see this thing.

49:34.960 --> 49:38.140
This? This?

49:38.240 --> 49:39.740
You're gonna protect yourself with this?

49:39.840 --> 49:42.366
You know who uses guns like these?
Whores!

50:00.160 --> 50:02.208
You're walking us right into a trap.

50:04.080 --> 50:06.082
And you can't even see it.

50:12.440 --> 50:14.727
This is not allowed in my fucking house.

50:16.600 --> 50:18.728
Then you need to protect us.

50:22.320 --> 50:24.322
That is what I'm doing.

50:40.960 --> 50:42.485
No, no, no.

50:42.600 --> 50:45.660
- Can I help you?
- One at a time. Birthday girl first.

50:45.760 --> 50:47.444
- Please.
- In a minute.

50:50.080 --> 50:52.731
- Gracias, Maria.
- Mr. Morales.

50:53.960 --> 50:55.460
- Guys...
- We don't want any trouble.

50:55.560 --> 50:57.642
- Are you serious?
- We don't want any trouble here.

50:58.480 --> 51:00.721
- What'll we play?
- Here you go.

51:01.720 --> 51:04.007
As you can see, I'm in the middle
of my daughter's birthday party.

51:04.120 --> 51:05.780
I understand and I apologize. I do.

51:05.880 --> 51:09.340
But this is a warrant, and we need to gain
complete access to the property.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.965
What is this?

51:12.560 --> 51:14.130
Let me check something.

51:15.280 --> 51:16.850
Is he serious?

51:19.120 --> 51:21.122
I'm gonna fucking kill this guy.

51:22.640 --> 51:24.290
They got a birthday party going on.

51:26.080 --> 51:28.401
- Abel.
- He's saying it's a bad time.

51:32.280 --> 51:33.805
Give me five minutes.

51:35.880 --> 51:38.360
Maria. Keep the kids playing.

51:43.960 --> 51:46.460
- Mr. Lawrence, is it?
- Yes.

51:46.560 --> 51:48.820
Anna Morales.

51:48.920 --> 51:50.649
May I speak with you for a minute?

51:57.320 --> 51:59.380
I understand you and your men
have a job to do here...

51:59.480 --> 52:02.563
but we're in the middle
of a 10-year-old's birthday party.

52:02.680 --> 52:06.700
I understand,
and I'm sorry, but we are coming in.

52:06.800 --> 52:10.646
That's not a problem. We have nothing
to hide from you. It's just...

52:11.720 --> 52:13.540
Well, we...
we just moved into the area...

52:13.640 --> 52:18.168
and... I have 20 guests inside my home.

52:19.280 --> 52:20.860
Can you give me five minutes...

52:20.960 --> 52:23.042
so I can ask everyone to leave calmly...

52:23.160 --> 52:25.162
before you guys come into my house?

52:27.080 --> 52:28.730
You can get them out of the house.

52:30.080 --> 52:31.570
Thank you.

52:38.480 --> 52:40.100
Where are you putting them?

52:40.200 --> 52:41.700
Oh, shit.

52:41.800 --> 52:43.370
Hand me those.

52:47.720 --> 52:49.860
You have... three minutes.

52:49.960 --> 52:51.500
What's going on out there?

52:51.600 --> 52:53.170
Our guests are leaving.

52:54.000 --> 52:55.620
Jesus. Anna.

52:55.720 --> 52:58.780
Why do we even have to be doing this?
What are we hiding here?

52:58.880 --> 53:02.248
I don't want them to go through these
before I have a chance to.

53:03.840 --> 53:05.888
Go. Get back in there.

53:17.040 --> 53:20.060
Here you go. Here you go.

53:20.160 --> 53:21.860
Thank you. One for you.

53:21.960 --> 53:23.485
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.410
Here you go...

53:27.360 --> 53:28.885
Come on, honey.

53:31.520 --> 53:33.010
Excuse me, ma'am.

53:33.800 --> 53:35.290
Here you go, sweetheart.

53:43.080 --> 53:44.969
Can we get you something to drink?

53:47.440 --> 53:49.010
No. I'm good.

54:00.600 --> 54:02.921
This is probably
one you're gonna regret.

54:05.160 --> 54:06.446
Excuse me?

54:08.280 --> 54:10.203
My husband's an honorable man.

54:12.240 --> 54:14.004
We're not who you think we are.

54:16.320 --> 54:18.004
I think I know your father.

54:19.440 --> 54:20.930
Good for you.

54:26.680 --> 54:29.650
My husband is not my father.

54:30.560 --> 54:32.130
Not even close.

54:33.440 --> 54:35.124
So if I were you...

54:36.160 --> 54:38.060
I would start treating us
with a little more respect...

54:38.160 --> 54:40.300
or I guarantee...

54:40.400 --> 54:44.689
he will make it
his mission in life to ruin you.

54:49.640 --> 54:52.007
This was very disrespectful.

54:56.560 --> 54:58.722
And you're not gonna find
a fucking thing.

55:10.320 --> 55:13.164
Trucks 14 through 23 are on the road.

55:16.240 --> 55:18.891
Thirty to 33 are just about ready to go.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.483
Six, what are you doing back here?

55:30.240 --> 55:32.300
Hey. How are you?

55:32.400 --> 55:33.845
I'm... good.

55:34.720 --> 55:38.060
I'm a little bit nervous.
I'm heading on my first calls alone today.

55:38.160 --> 55:42.449
You'll be great. Just hold the eye contact
longer than you'd like.

55:43.200 --> 55:44.725
You'll see what happens.

55:46.280 --> 55:48.044
Good luck.

55:54.720 --> 55:56.563
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:00.040 --> 56:01.610
Glad to see you back here.

56:02.760 --> 56:04.330
You look good.

56:07.200 --> 56:09.123
You ready to get back to work?

56:11.200 --> 56:12.725
English.

56:14.080 --> 56:15.605
I think so.

56:16.640 --> 56:18.290
You are.

56:18.920 --> 56:20.410
Where you heading?

56:21.480 --> 56:23.060
Bulk delivery to Chase.

56:23.160 --> 56:25.561
Manhattan. It's a cakewalk.

56:34.560 --> 56:36.130
I feel...

56:37.960 --> 56:39.500
vulnerable.

56:39.600 --> 56:41.011
Good.

56:41.720 --> 56:43.449
Because you are vulnerable.

56:44.680 --> 56:46.603
We all are.

56:50.960 --> 56:55.124
But to be successful and great...

56:55.840 --> 56:58.923
you must keep going back.

56:59.680 --> 57:01.887
And I know what these guys
wanna be doing.

57:03.160 --> 57:05.288
But that doesn't make you any safer.

57:06.760 --> 57:09.764
'Cause then they'll come back at us
with everything they have.

57:11.320 --> 57:13.607
So this is what we do.

57:15.080 --> 57:16.684
We keep going back.

57:17.720 --> 57:22.169
And the times will get better
and get safer... They will.

57:24.640 --> 57:25.801
So go.

57:26.800 --> 57:28.689
You're strong just by going.

57:30.800 --> 57:32.290
Stronger, in fact.

57:35.000 --> 57:36.490
Thank you.

57:41.760 --> 57:42.940
Mr. Rose?

57:43.040 --> 57:45.020
- I'm Alex, with Standard Heating Oil.
- Nice to meet you, kid.

57:45.120 --> 57:47.740
I was just about to show your wife
the results of my inspection.

57:47.840 --> 57:50.340
Should we head upstairs,
run through some numbers?

57:50.440 --> 57:53.820
Sure. I just had one question
about the exhaust chimney.

57:53.920 --> 57:55.604
Would you be willing to take a look?

57:56.200 --> 57:57.884
Of course.

58:09.560 --> 58:12.848
I'm gonna head up.
Can I get you something to drink?

58:13.400 --> 58:14.540
Coffee? Tea?

58:14.640 --> 58:16.483
Tea would be great.

58:17.560 --> 58:20.211
Awesome. I'm a coffee man myself.

58:21.200 --> 58:22.980
- Here you go.
- All right.

58:23.080 --> 58:24.809
So, what exactly was the problem?

58:37.760 --> 58:39.700
Kathy. Kathy! Kathy!

58:39.800 --> 58:42.100
On the 59th Street Bridge. Kathy!

58:42.200 --> 58:43.820
- Who is that?
- Kathy. Over.

58:43.920 --> 58:45.420
They're coming again. Help!

58:45.520 --> 58:47.620
- Julian?
- Help!

58:47.720 --> 58:49.324
- Where are you?
- Help!

58:50.760 --> 58:52.285
Julian!

58:53.880 --> 58:55.245
Julian!

58:57.960 --> 59:00.980
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Easy.
- "Whoa, whoa." Fuck you!

59:01.080 --> 59:03.700
- Relax. What are you doing?
- Relax? You fucking relax!

59:03.800 --> 59:06.100
Put it down.
What are you doing? Got a fucking gun!

59:06.200 --> 59:07.740
Look, you wanna do this?

59:07.840 --> 59:10.100
Look! What, you want me
to fucking shoot?

59:10.200 --> 59:12.700
You wanna kill someone? Think about it.

59:12.800 --> 59:14.609
Go back, you piece of shit!

59:22.480 --> 59:24.140
- John, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

59:24.240 --> 59:25.730
- Did he hit you?
- No.

59:27.240 --> 59:28.730
Where is he?

59:29.440 --> 59:30.980
He's in front of the truck.

59:31.080 --> 59:33.731
There's people out here!
You're gonna kill somebody!

59:33.840 --> 59:36.127
You should have thought about that
before you came!

59:37.600 --> 59:39.284
- Jesus!
- What?

59:42.560 --> 59:45.060
Cops! Cops!

59:45.160 --> 59:47.322
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

59:48.640 --> 59:51.803
- Back in the car, John!
- They're coming from that direction.

59:52.440 --> 59:54.020
Fuck.

59:54.120 --> 59:55.610
I'm running.

01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.650
You better run, cuz.

01:00:06.720 --> 01:00:09.300
- Back in your car.
- Oh, shit.

01:00:09.400 --> 01:00:11.060
- Get back!
- Stay in the car.

01:00:11.160 --> 01:00:12.161
Go, go, go!

01:00:16.200 --> 01:00:17.201
Freeze!

01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.580
Oh, there he is.

01:01:00.680 --> 01:01:02.364
Got to be the hero?

01:01:03.080 --> 01:01:04.730
Oh, fuck you.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:08.211
Couldn't just let us take
the fucking truck.

01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:10.529
Did they see you come in here?

01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:13.329
Man, I don't think so.

01:01:13.440 --> 01:01:16.020
- Did they or not? Yes or no.
- No!

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:18.726
Look, there's a door down here
about four more flights.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:21.680
You come out under the bridge.
It's a park.

01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:25.728
- Fuck you!
- You're welcome.

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:16.770
Where's the truck now?

01:02:17.280 --> 01:02:19.009
It's still up on the bridge.

01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:23.687
- How many shots were fired?
- I don't know.

01:02:23.800 --> 01:02:27.282
Kathy, it's me.
What are you talking about? What shots?

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:32.725
It's 16. Someone shot up his truck
on the 59th Street Bridge.

01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:35.540
It was Julian.

01:02:35.640 --> 01:02:37.130
He's gone.

01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.485
He ran away

01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:43.481
Abel?

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:14.324
I don't know about that.

01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.009
Can you give us a minute, please?

01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:28.204
- Please...
- Do not...

01:03:32.920 --> 01:03:34.160
I heard.

01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:37.606
We had nothing to do with this.

01:03:39.040 --> 01:03:40.963
This is not the way that I do business.

01:03:42.080 --> 01:03:45.140
In fact, I've been warning my men
against this very thing.

01:03:45.240 --> 01:03:46.740
This is terrible for me.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:50.447
- It's not good... for either of us.
- I know.

01:03:51.080 --> 01:03:53.420
In my job,
we use whatever leverage we can gain...

01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.580
as I'm sure you do in your business.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:57.500
This is an ongoing investigation...

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:59.460
and this incident will just be
one piece of many.

01:03:59.560 --> 01:04:01.767
So, as much as I appreciate
you coming here...

01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:04.649
I got nothing I can tell you.

01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:09.807
What a fucking mess this is.

01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.650
You know where he is?

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:15.460
No.

01:04:15.560 --> 01:04:18.928
When you do, bring him to us.

01:04:19.880 --> 01:04:22.620
A situation like this happening
in such a dangerous and public way...

01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:25.380
within an industry
that I'm charged with cleaning up...

01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.403
is very bad for me.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:31.725
I'll find him.

01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:42.700
Right now it's 24 degrees
in midtown Manhattan.

01:04:42.800 --> 01:04:44.420
Look for increasing cloudiness today,..

01:04:44.520 --> 01:04:49.580
With a chance of light showers,
with highs in the upper20s.

01:04:49.680 --> 01:04:53.940
A masked slasher is at large on the streets
of midtown Manhattan.

01:04:54.040 --> 01:04:56.540
- No, no, no, no, no.
- The killer has struck at least four times.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:59.820
Three of his victims
were black or Hispanic.

01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:01.780
Witnesses to two
of the stabbing deaths...

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:05.500
describe a stocky white man
wearing wire-rimmed glasses...

01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:07.204
who approached his victims...

01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.285
Okay.

01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:16.020
- Abel.
- Arthur.

01:05:16.120 --> 01:05:18.964
I wanted to come
and talk to you in person.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.700
We're not gonna be able
to show up for you on Thursday.

01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:24.260
We can't do the loan.

01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.460
I wanted to let you know
as soon as possible...

01:05:26.560 --> 01:05:28.881
so you could try to put
something else together.

01:05:29.560 --> 01:05:31.289
Thank you for coming.

01:05:33.920 --> 01:05:36.764
- This is not right.
- I know.

01:05:37.680 --> 01:05:39.967
And you are aware of the position
that this is putting me in?

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:41.605
I am.

01:05:42.480 --> 01:05:46.380
Arthur, I paid off my first loan to you
11 years ago.

01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:48.900
- I know.
- Do you remember the term on that loan?

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.540
- I don't.
- I had five years to pay you back.

01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:55.060
Do you know
how long it took me to pay you off?

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.700
- Seven months.
- Six and a half.

01:05:57.800 --> 01:05:58.740
I'm sorry.

01:05:58.840 --> 01:06:03.100
I put 40% down deposit
on this property...

01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:04.900
because you said
that you would be there.

01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:10.211
You now have three serious separate
pending legal cases against you...

01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:13.660
one with 16 counts of misconduct...

01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:15.900
ranging from fraud to tax evasion.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.780
And then today,
in the middle of our meeting...

01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:21.740
I get a report saying you had armed
your entire fleet of drivers...

01:06:21.840 --> 01:06:24.420
which led to a shoot... out
on the 59th Street Bridge.

01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:27.251
- None of that is true.
- That may be.

01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:33.650
"May"?

01:06:34.760 --> 01:06:36.250
It doesn't matter.

01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.004
It does matter.

01:06:42.360 --> 01:06:44.100
It matters that you know
we didn't do this.

01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:47.522
I do. I do.

01:06:48.520 --> 01:06:50.966
But it doesn't matter.
I can't do anything.

01:06:52.880 --> 01:06:54.723
I'm sorry.

01:07:01.120 --> 01:07:02.690
I'll find it.

01:07:05.920 --> 01:07:07.490
I know you will.

01:08:16.800 --> 01:08:18.086
Come on.

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.604
It's horrible.

01:08:39.840 --> 01:08:41.285
Yes.

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.490
Where is he?

01:08:48.160 --> 01:08:49.685
We're looking for him.

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:53.060
Have they found the other guys yet?

01:08:53.160 --> 01:08:54.810
No. Of course not.

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:00.050
You okay?

01:09:02.560 --> 01:09:04.210
No, I'm not okay.

01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:08.700
They're out.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:09.961
Who?

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:11.845
The bank.

01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:16.363
What does that mean?

01:09:17.760 --> 01:09:20.684
We'll find the money somewhere else.
That's what it means.

01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:23.368
We have two days.

01:10:02.120 --> 01:10:03.610
No.

01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.450
No.

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:56.490
Julian. Julian, stop running!

01:12:57.440 --> 01:12:59.090
Andrew, he's coming to you!

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:01.809
We got him!

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:55.540
He's turning me in?

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:57.688
Of course we're turning you in.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:01.962
You put everything he's worked for
for the last 20 years at risk.

01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:06.281
If it was up to me, we'd be doing this
in a very different way.

01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:11.380
They said you fired off four shots.

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.005
Is that right?

01:14:15.200 --> 01:14:17.851
- I don't know.
- Where's the gun?

01:14:18.760 --> 01:14:22.003
I... I threw it in the river.

01:14:22.640 --> 01:14:24.051
Good.

01:14:25.160 --> 01:14:29.420
When we did our background check,
it said you'd never been arrested.

01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:31.010
Is that true?

01:14:32.040 --> 01:14:34.340
Why is this putting everything at risk?

01:14:34.440 --> 01:14:37.364
I asked you
if you've ever been arrested.

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.340
No.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:43.125
Because no bank will touch us.

01:14:44.360 --> 01:14:47.220
Because if he can't close
on that piece of property...

01:14:47.320 --> 01:14:50.210
then your buddy here loses everything.

01:14:51.360 --> 01:14:52.885
That's why.

01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:55.805
Here.

01:14:58.160 --> 01:15:01.846
This is an attorney
that'll meet you at the station.

01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:08.170
You no longer work for us.
You've been fired.

01:15:09.160 --> 01:15:12.403
Abel would like to pay for the lawyer.

01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:16.410
Good luck.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:34.650
I'm sorry.

01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.765
I know.

01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:41.885
I was scared.

01:15:43.520 --> 01:15:45.540
- Yeah, I know.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

01:15:45.640 --> 01:15:47.722
And you don't get scared?

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:53.404
I've always been a lot more afraid
of failure than of anything else.

01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.606
It wasn't always like this.

01:16:08.160 --> 01:16:09.764
I am sorry.

01:16:12.120 --> 01:16:13.121
Good.

01:16:15.600 --> 01:16:17.125
Okay.

01:16:18.760 --> 01:16:20.460
Don't. Don't.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:23.900
I'm not... I'm not strong.

01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.490
Don't.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.860
Well, that doesn't have to be true.

01:16:27.960 --> 01:16:31.100
Listen to me. Trust me. Trust me.

01:16:31.200 --> 01:16:34.460
- I'm not...
- Julian. Julian.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.085
That's... That's enough.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.490
Hey.

01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:01.890
I am sorry.

01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.260
- He's running!
- Hey!

01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:10.691
Stop him!

01:17:12.680 --> 01:17:15.180
Officers in pursuit! Suspect on foot!

01:17:15.280 --> 01:17:16.520
Stop him!

01:17:57.800 --> 01:18:01.043
- Thank you for seeing me.
- Of course.

01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.620
Actually, I think we have met before...

01:18:03.720 --> 01:18:07.300
but I didn't realize that you were
Saul's granddaughter.

01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:08.401
I am.

01:18:08.920 --> 01:18:12.020
My grandfather didn't trust
any of his children to run the business.

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:13.121
Yes.

01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:17.402
I know that you tried to buy the company
from my grandfather several times.

01:18:18.440 --> 01:18:19.980
His goal was to stay healthy...

01:18:20.080 --> 01:18:22.940
long enough to be able
to give the company to me...

01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:25.361
which he thankfully did.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:28.020
So while I appreciate your visit...

01:18:28.120 --> 01:18:30.660
we are still not for sale.

01:18:30.760 --> 01:18:33.445
I'm not here to offer to buy
your company.

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.660
Oh.

01:18:34.760 --> 01:18:37.380
But as you will soon learn...

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:41.485
some years are good and others not so.

01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:50.340
I am under contract with a significant
hard deposit at risk...

01:18:50.440 --> 01:18:53.180
to purchase the old Bayfront terminal.

01:18:53.280 --> 01:18:54.740
I see.

01:18:54.840 --> 01:18:56.365
And...

01:18:58.840 --> 01:19:03.129
due to circumstances
out of my control...

01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.970
my bank has left me at the altar.

01:19:10.120 --> 01:19:11.645
So I'm here...

01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.244
hat in hand...

01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:19.010
looking for a loan.

01:19:21.800 --> 01:19:25.361
I certainly expect
the terms to be in your favor.

01:19:26.640 --> 01:19:30.486
But if your grandfather
trusted you with his company...

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:34.322
then I would be willing
to trust you as my lien holder.

01:19:36.160 --> 01:19:37.969
How much?

01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:41.888
I need a million and a half dollars.

01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:52.729
Would you give us a minute?

01:20:08.120 --> 01:20:09.645
Yes?

01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:12.090
Oh.

01:20:15.200 --> 01:20:16.929
You can go back in.

01:20:31.720 --> 01:20:35.300
We can offer you 500,000
at 20% for a year.

01:20:35.400 --> 01:20:38.140
And we would need a five-year straight
wholesale holding agreement...

01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:41.926
for 250,000 gallons a year
at your new facility.

01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:52.605
Okay.

01:20:54.720 --> 01:20:56.245
Thank you.

01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.890
Thank you.

01:21:03.800 --> 01:21:06.060
So, I should start by thanking you...

01:21:06.160 --> 01:21:09.084
for your assistance
in attempting to bring in the driver.

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:11.980
Yeah, we didn't expect him
to react that way.

01:21:12.080 --> 01:21:15.300
Yeah, well, the officers there didn't
set it up very well on their end either.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:16.401
I'm sorry.

01:21:17.720 --> 01:21:19.500
Miss Lange.

01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:21.780
It has been brought to our attention...

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.980
that it might be beneficial
on your end...

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.740
to resolve this issue
in a time-sensitive way.

01:21:27.840 --> 01:21:29.860
It's a possibility.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:33.965
So we have prepared
an offer for you to review.

01:21:40.840 --> 01:21:42.763
I'll present it to him.

01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:45.483
It's good, Andrew.

01:21:47.120 --> 01:21:48.201
Okay.

01:22:20.560 --> 01:22:22.500
I need more time.

01:22:24.640 --> 01:22:26.244
Of course you do.

01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.860
I know our agreement
doesn't allow for that.

01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:34.449
But I need more time.

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:40.166
It is a difficult time to do business.

01:22:41.320 --> 01:22:43.049
Yes. Yes, it is.

01:22:44.520 --> 01:22:46.204
I...

01:22:49.160 --> 01:22:51.460
I'll give you three days.

01:22:51.560 --> 01:22:53.927
But then it's over.

01:22:54.880 --> 01:22:57.247
Thank you. Thank you, Joseph.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.245
You're welcome.

01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:18.530
Oh.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:21.767
Abel. Please, sit down.

01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.620
- Andrew.
- Yes.

01:23:25.720 --> 01:23:27.722
- How are you?
- I'm well.

01:23:36.720 --> 01:23:38.245
Abel.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:48.530
Stop.

01:24:05.920 --> 01:24:09.766
Abel, we had a chance to meet
for a little bit before you got here.

01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:13.660
And, of course, everyone in this room...

01:24:13.760 --> 01:24:17.321
is fully capable of lying to
their own mothers on their deathbeds.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:21.660
But the conclusion that we've come to...

01:24:21.760 --> 01:24:24.780
and I should say
that we feel fairly certain...

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:27.121
after a very frank conversation...

01:24:28.400 --> 01:24:31.563
that the guys who are doing this...

01:24:32.680 --> 01:24:36.321
that they're not actually
working for anyone in this room.

01:24:37.080 --> 01:24:40.860
As you know, there are plenty
of other smaller providers in the area...

01:24:40.960 --> 01:24:44.328
that might have something to do with it
who are not here tonight, so...

01:24:45.480 --> 01:24:47.005
Peter, thank you.

01:24:47.640 --> 01:24:49.290
Thank you. That may be true.

01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.940
But over the last six months...

01:24:55.040 --> 01:25:00.444
110,000 gallons of fuel
have been stolen from me and my family.

01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:06.288
Now, the reason we asked Bill
to get you all here...

01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:10.140
is because the people at this table...

01:25:10.240 --> 01:25:13.380
are the only people
within 200 miles of here...

01:25:13.480 --> 01:25:19.647
that have the ability to purchase
and store that kind of quantity.

01:25:22.240 --> 01:25:23.571
So...

01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.364
No matter what bullshit
you've been telling each other...

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:33.003
one of you... or two...

01:25:33.800 --> 01:25:35.165
or three...

01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:40.100
have been allowing this to happen
by buying it from these cowards...

01:25:40.200 --> 01:25:42.680
or worse yet, hiring them to do it.

01:25:44.120 --> 01:25:46.043
So what I'm saying is stop.

01:25:50.520 --> 01:25:51.726
Now.

01:26:00.440 --> 01:26:02.283
Have some pride in what you do...

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:04.885
and stop.

01:26:35.120 --> 01:26:36.121
Hi.

01:26:37.480 --> 01:26:39.050
Hi.

01:26:44.160 --> 01:26:46.049
How's it coming?

01:26:49.240 --> 01:26:50.924
I got to 1975.

01:26:52.360 --> 01:26:55.204
1975. That was a good year.

01:26:56.520 --> 01:26:58.090
No?

01:27:00.360 --> 01:27:03.409
- How is it?
- Oh, I'm not sure yet.

01:27:04.360 --> 01:27:06.601
But I don't think it's as bad
as they're saying it is.

01:27:08.440 --> 01:27:10.488
I guess I kind of knew what I was doing.

01:27:15.120 --> 01:27:17.260
How'd you do?

01:27:17.360 --> 01:27:19.420
Got us three more days.

01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.140
That's great.

01:27:21.240 --> 01:27:23.288
And I got a piece from Saul.

01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:27.248
But we're still about a million short.

01:27:35.520 --> 01:27:37.284
When are you gonna go see
your little brother?

01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.290
First thing.

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.540
And Peter?

01:27:43.640 --> 01:27:45.051
Probably.

01:27:53.720 --> 01:27:55.620
How are the girls?

01:27:55.720 --> 01:27:57.802
Feel like I haven't seen them forever.

01:27:59.480 --> 01:28:01.005
They're fine.

01:28:05.120 --> 01:28:07.248
When I was putting them
to bed tonight...

01:28:12.280 --> 01:28:15.682
I told them
that their dad was out there...

01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.689
taking care of us.

01:28:23.560 --> 01:28:25.961
I said that whatever he wanted...

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.010
he was gonna get...

01:28:31.080 --> 01:28:33.208
and that there was no man...

01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:38.691
No man would ever stand in his way.

01:28:43.560 --> 01:28:45.449
This is all worth it.

01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:49.002
- Of course.
- Hey.

01:28:51.960 --> 01:28:53.883
Look at us. It is.

01:28:59.040 --> 01:29:01.008
I know.

01:29:01.640 --> 01:29:03.130
I know.

01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:11.651
Hut!

01:29:12.760 --> 01:29:14.860
- There you go!
- Yeah!

01:29:14.960 --> 01:29:17.620
- Hey, come on. Stop it. Get back. Get back.
- Good job, Morales.

01:29:17.720 --> 01:29:19.927
I'm gonna take a second.

01:29:26.080 --> 01:29:28.242
- I didn't mean to take you away.
- Oh, we're done.

01:29:29.920 --> 01:29:31.380
I didn't know you were coming.

01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:33.005
Yeah, I didn't either.

01:29:36.480 --> 01:29:38.005
You've grown.

01:29:39.240 --> 01:29:40.700
You saw me a month ago.

01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:42.609
I know. I know. But you have.

01:29:51.480 --> 01:29:52.925
Jesus.

01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:56.442
I don't know how you
get any work done around here.

01:29:57.120 --> 01:29:58.451
I don't.

01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:05.766
So, I'm in a bit of a rough patch here.

01:30:08.320 --> 01:30:11.608
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.929
It happens.

01:30:17.120 --> 01:30:18.281
I know.

01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:22.050
Good.

01:30:22.800 --> 01:30:26.327
- I need your signature on this.
- Well, what is it?

01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:28.283
It's a short... term mortgage...

01:30:28.400 --> 01:30:29.940
on the apartment building
we own together.

01:30:30.040 --> 01:30:32.660
That thing isn't worth
more than 150 grand though.

01:30:32.760 --> 01:30:34.489
It's 210.

01:30:37.840 --> 01:30:43.643
Since when do you need to take out
sucker mortgages for 200 grand?

01:30:48.760 --> 01:30:50.683
I'm up against it here.

01:31:03.920 --> 01:31:05.410
Thank you.

01:31:08.480 --> 01:31:10.050
It's good to see your face.

01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:14.850
I love you.

01:31:19.680 --> 01:31:21.682
Fourteen, you gonna
check that tank at D'Amico's?

01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:23.521
Yeah.

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.367
- Oh, fuck.
- Get out of the fucking truck!

01:31:30.320 --> 01:31:31.526
Who's that?

01:31:32.600 --> 01:31:33.647
Eddy!

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:35.980
- Kathy.
- Abel?

01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.780
What's going on?

01:31:37.880 --> 01:31:39.940
It's 17 Two guys are coming at me.

01:31:40.040 --> 01:31:41.485
Where are you?

01:31:41.600 --> 01:31:44.060
Hall Street and Flushing A venue.

01:31:44.160 --> 01:31:47.180
I gotta get out of here. Motherfuckers!

01:31:47.280 --> 01:31:49.567
I'm right here.
I'll see if I can find you.

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:52.780
Eddy?

01:31:52.880 --> 01:31:54.530
Eddy!

01:31:55.920 --> 01:31:56.921
Abel.

01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:01.166
Abel!

01:32:09.920 --> 01:32:11.300
Hey!

01:32:11.400 --> 01:32:12.925
Abel! That way!

01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.486
Shit.

01:36:47.920 --> 01:36:50.127
Next stop, 50th Street.

01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:52.242
This is the B train to the Bronx.

01:37:25.720 --> 01:37:28.166
B train to the Bronx.
Next stop, 50th Street.

01:37:44.320 --> 01:37:46.926
Next stop, 50th Street.
Doors open on the right.

01:37:56.520 --> 01:37:58.045
Stand clear.

01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:17.850
Who hired you?

01:38:21.760 --> 01:38:23.285
Who do you work for?

01:38:24.200 --> 01:38:28.000
Hey. Listen to me. Your friend is dead.

01:38:28.760 --> 01:38:30.808
Who hired you?

01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.327
Please. Please.

01:38:43.560 --> 01:38:47.121
Please. Please.

01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:51.721
Please. Please.

01:38:57.160 --> 01:38:58.650
Go.

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.325
Get out of here.

01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:10.047
Thank you.

01:39:30.920 --> 01:39:32.809
I don't work for anybody!

01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:38.965
But I sold a load of your fuel
in Far Rockaway last week!

01:40:01.840 --> 01:40:03.330
Hey.

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.049
- Jimmy, could you give us a minute?
- Yeah. Sure.

01:40:15.720 --> 01:40:17.245
Abel.

01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:21.460
- That was well said last night.
- Thank you.

01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:23.050
What can I do for you?

01:40:23.160 --> 01:40:25.288
I'm just here to collect
that check that you owe me.

01:40:25.960 --> 01:40:29.567
- What check it that?
- The one for $213,000.

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.327
That funny?

01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:34.820
- A little.
- Why is that?

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:37.048
'Cause I don't know
what the fuck you're talking about.

01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:40.980
That's how much has been taken from me
over the last six months.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:43.242
- I had nothing to do with that.
- No?

01:40:43.960 --> 01:40:46.660
Your Far Rockaway facility
bought a load of fuel...

01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:48.940
off of one
of my stolen trucks last week.

01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.804
That's not possible.

01:40:56.480 --> 01:40:57.720
Arnold.

01:40:58.560 --> 01:41:02.220
I was standing on one of my hijacked
trucks a couple weeks ago...

01:41:02.320 --> 01:41:06.644
just thinking about the cowards
that have done this...

01:41:07.960 --> 01:41:09.485
when I remembered...

01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.527
that load was purchased
off a barge from Texas.

01:41:17.640 --> 01:41:21.884
Now, as you know,
Texas number four is marked.

01:41:24.400 --> 01:41:27.540
Do you have any receipts
over the last year...

01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.961
for incoming marked number four?

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.642
So I'm guessing
there's at least, what...

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:43.246
4,600 gallons of marked fuel
in your small tank right now.

01:41:46.640 --> 01:41:48.165
How much?

01:41:49.080 --> 01:41:53.324
I said... 213,000.

01:41:57.480 --> 01:41:59.005
I need a day.

01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:01.820
Okay.

01:42:01.920 --> 01:42:04.810
But I was just buying
the stuff off these guys.

01:42:05.640 --> 01:42:07.900
I... I-I only bought a couple loads.

01:42:08.000 --> 01:42:10.685
I don't know who they are.
I would never do that.

01:42:11.640 --> 01:42:13.540
This may ruin me.

01:42:13.640 --> 01:42:16.540
My goal was to have you out of business
by the end of next year.

01:42:16.640 --> 01:42:18.060
But if you're this fucking desperate...

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:20.481
I imagine it won't even take that long.

01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:23.700
Makes you miss having
your dad around, doesn't it?

01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:27.088
Abel. I wasn't the only person
buying this shit.

01:42:27.200 --> 01:42:29.100
All right, well,
when you find out who else did it...

01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:31.168
you can have them pay the difference.

01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:34.180
But I need the whole lot
by tomorrow morning...

01:42:34.280 --> 01:42:37.124
or you're gonna have the feds
at your doorstep by noon.

01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.004
There he is.

01:42:59.760 --> 01:43:01.649
The caped crusader.

01:43:04.280 --> 01:43:05.770
Come on up.

01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.044
You all right?

01:43:10.160 --> 01:43:11.650
Yeah.

01:43:17.080 --> 01:43:19.020
Thank you for seeing me.

01:43:19.120 --> 01:43:20.610
Of course.

01:43:23.880 --> 01:43:25.405
So what is it?

01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:32.885
I need a loan.

01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:40.605
- You don't wanna do that.
- Yeah, no shit.

01:43:43.560 --> 01:43:45.050
But I'm here.

01:43:47.400 --> 01:43:49.084
What are we talking about?

01:43:49.200 --> 01:43:50.770
$600,000.

01:43:51.840 --> 01:43:53.490
Jesus, Abel.

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:58.290
- Abel, that's a problem.
- Yeah.

01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:01.500
But if I don't get it...

01:44:01.600 --> 01:44:03.125
What's my collateral?

01:44:05.440 --> 01:44:08.125
- The terminal.
- Oh, yeah?

01:44:09.320 --> 01:44:12.060
Me and how many other people
are gonna be coming after it? No way.

01:44:12.160 --> 01:44:13.286
Peter.

01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:16.284
You'll get your money.

01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:20.940
You know, Abel,
I respect everything that you've done.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.900
And because of it, we haven't come
after you the way that I should have...

01:44:24.000 --> 01:44:27.800
for coming into my service area
and poaching my customers.

01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:33.660
You're good at what you do,
probably better than us.

01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:35.380
I accept that.

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.050
But this would be different.

01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:40.642
I don't want you to be in this position.

01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:46.491
We are not nice people to borrow
three quarters of a million dollars from.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:50.250
I know that.

01:44:55.680 --> 01:44:58.081
You know,
I'm... I'm gonna think about this.

01:45:00.000 --> 01:45:02.002
You know, we should both
think about this.

01:45:02.600 --> 01:45:03.965
Yeah.

01:45:37.640 --> 01:45:39.660
What a day.

01:45:39.760 --> 01:45:41.250
Yeah.

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.010
You okay?

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:49.970
Yeah.

01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:54.924
How's your brother?

01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:59.849
He's good. He's good.

01:46:01.000 --> 01:46:03.020
- The girls up there though...
- Stop.

01:46:03.120 --> 01:46:04.610
Oh!

01:46:06.200 --> 01:46:08.540
They didn't have girls like that
where I went to school.

01:46:08.640 --> 01:46:10.165
Shut your mouth.

01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:14.210
How'd it go?

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:18.660
I think we can pull it off.

01:46:18.760 --> 01:46:21.100
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.090
Three different parties. It's a mess.

01:46:25.760 --> 01:46:27.250
And the terms...

01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:31.660
Peter finally showed me his true colors.

01:46:31.760 --> 01:46:33.285
I'm sorry.

01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:37.180
I spent my whole life
trying not to become a gangster.

01:46:37.280 --> 01:46:39.420
I know.

01:46:39.520 --> 01:46:42.763
And now, on the biggest deal
of my career, they're gonna own me.

01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:11.610
- What is this?
- Bank account.

01:47:14.440 --> 01:47:15.860
Whose?

01:47:15.960 --> 01:47:17.485
Ours.

01:47:20.960 --> 01:47:22.246
Ours?

01:47:29.240 --> 01:47:32.780
- How much is in here?
- A lot.

01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.566
This will help. You replace Peter's money,
get him out of the deal.

01:47:44.600 --> 01:47:46.125
Where did this come from?

01:47:46.960 --> 01:47:48.086
Abel.

01:47:49.560 --> 01:47:51.244
Where did this come from?

01:47:55.560 --> 01:47:58.803
I've been skimming money
from the company.

01:48:04.160 --> 01:48:05.207
Anna.

01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.840
How long?

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.700
From the beginning.

01:48:10.800 --> 01:48:13.180
It was just in case times got tough.

01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:16.780
But then it was because you were taking
all these crazy chances.

01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:19.690
I didn't know what else to do.
I couldn't risk us being left with nothing.

01:48:21.480 --> 01:48:23.209
What am I supposed to do with this?

01:48:23.960 --> 01:48:25.450
Use it.

01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.166
- Is it clean?
- I don't know what that means.

01:48:29.280 --> 01:48:31.460
It means that if I were
to walk into the office...

01:48:31.560 --> 01:48:34.245
of the people that are trying
to put us in jail right now...

01:48:34.360 --> 01:48:36.740
and if I slap the check
from this account on their desk...

01:48:36.840 --> 01:48:38.780
would it push me deeper into hell?

01:48:38.880 --> 01:48:41.300
Or would it help to pull me out?
That's what it means.

01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:44.051
It's as clean as every dollar
we've ever made.

01:48:45.800 --> 01:48:48.540
- Well, that's a fucking bullshit answer.
- I can clear it in the books.

01:48:48.640 --> 01:48:51.500
I don't want anything to do with this!

01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:52.601
Fine.

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:55.820
You keep it exactly
where it is, all right?

01:48:55.920 --> 01:48:59.100
And you use it
when they drag me off to jail.

01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:01.362
So what's the plan here?

01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.900
I'm gonna get this done...

01:49:05.000 --> 01:49:06.923
and it's not gonna be as a cheat.

01:49:07.720 --> 01:49:10.020
God, you're too much!

01:49:10.120 --> 01:49:12.580
You've been walking around
your whole life...

01:49:12.680 --> 01:49:14.820
like all this happened
'cause of your hard work...

01:49:14.920 --> 01:49:16.900
your good luck, your charm.

01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:19.162
Mr. Fucking American Dream.

01:49:19.280 --> 01:49:22.580
It wasn't your good luck
helping you out all these years.

01:49:22.680 --> 01:49:26.220
It was me doing the things
you didn't wanna know about!

01:49:26.320 --> 01:49:28.721
You stole from me!

01:49:31.960 --> 01:49:33.420
Abel.

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:35.860
You've been so good in not letting
your ego get in the way...

01:49:35.960 --> 01:49:37.610
when it comes to business.

01:49:38.640 --> 01:49:40.688
Don't start now 'cause it's me.

01:49:53.040 --> 01:49:55.140
This is 1010 WINS.

01:49:55.240 --> 01:49:58.323
You give us 22 minutes,
we'll give you the world.

01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:01.740
Good morning. It's 50 degrees.

01:50:01.840 --> 01:50:04.460
Time is 7:15

01:50:04.560 --> 01:50:06.780
President Reagan
spoke to the nation last night...

01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:08.962
concerning the state
of our country's economy.

01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.540
He spoke about Republicans' proposed plans
to cut government spending...

01:50:12.640 --> 01:50:14.140
trim back regulation on business...

01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:16.561
and reduce taxes
over the next three years.

01:50:17.640 --> 01:50:19.210
We'll use the money.

01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:22.460
Your money.

01:50:22.560 --> 01:50:24.085
It's the smart play.

01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:26.850
It's our money.

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:32.090
I know.

01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:49.525
Good morning.

01:50:50.360 --> 01:50:52.681
- You good?
- How are you?

01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:01.570
Pen, please.

01:51:08.520 --> 01:51:10.284
These fucking guys.

01:51:21.400 --> 01:51:23.620
What's with the extra 11 thou?

01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:26.620
There's some fuel left over
in two of the tanks.

01:51:26.720 --> 01:51:28.529
It was a fair price for it.

01:51:55.800 --> 01:51:57.040
Mazel tov.

01:51:58.080 --> 01:51:59.860
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:51:59.960 --> 01:52:01.485
Thank you.

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:07.445
Shalom.

01:52:15.400 --> 01:52:17.050
Congratulations.

01:52:19.440 --> 01:52:20.965
Did you know?

01:52:22.120 --> 01:52:23.610
About the money?

01:52:24.440 --> 01:52:25.965
Yes.

01:52:34.680 --> 01:52:36.620
You should have told me.

01:52:36.720 --> 01:52:38.051
I know.

01:52:39.120 --> 01:52:40.645
I'm sorry.

01:52:53.440 --> 01:52:55.488
Take a look at this.

01:53:02.680 --> 01:53:07.846
You know something? I never realized
that we had this view from back here.

01:53:08.800 --> 01:53:10.086
I did.

01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.885
It's beautiful.

01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:25.565
Abel!

01:53:35.800 --> 01:53:38.371
I thought you said
you threw that in the river.

01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:42.365
Well, I didn't.

01:53:43.360 --> 01:53:44.885
Yeah, I can see that.

01:53:52.280 --> 01:53:54.282
I have nowhere to go.

01:53:57.200 --> 01:53:58.725
Nowhere easy.

01:54:00.160 --> 01:54:01.321
Fuck you.

01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:03.001
Fuck you.

01:54:07.600 --> 01:54:09.125
I have nothing.

01:54:10.360 --> 01:54:11.850
I have nothing.

01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:16.851
And somehow you've ended up
with everything you wanted.

01:54:19.680 --> 01:54:21.380
It wasn't meant to be.

01:54:21.480 --> 01:54:23.687
What is that supposed to mean?

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:27.242
I know what you wanted.

01:54:28.560 --> 01:54:29.721
I know.

01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:33.328
But you have to forget that now.

01:54:38.400 --> 01:54:40.020
You gave me a good chance.

01:54:40.120 --> 01:54:44.921
You gave me a good chance. Correct?

01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:47.241
Yes.

01:54:48.920 --> 01:54:52.481
You gave me a better chance
than I deserved.

01:54:53.120 --> 01:54:54.326
Right?

01:54:54.920 --> 01:54:56.081
No.

01:54:57.760 --> 01:54:59.603
You're looking backwards.

01:55:00.600 --> 01:55:03.922
Look forwards.
That's the only thing you can control.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:15.610
Julian.

01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:18.841
Abel!

01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:24.245
Please take care of my family.

01:56:30.640 --> 01:56:32.165
Call the police.

01:57:03.480 --> 01:57:05.084
Mr. Morales.

01:57:07.240 --> 01:57:08.730
I'm very sorry.

01:57:09.520 --> 01:57:11.045
You knew him well?

01:57:12.000 --> 01:57:13.980
Yes, I did.

01:57:14.080 --> 01:57:16.242
He must have been under
a hell of a lot of pressure.

01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:18.450
Yes, he was.

01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.729
I'm sorry.

01:57:23.520 --> 01:57:24.980
Well, thank you for coming.

01:57:25.080 --> 01:57:28.060
I just wanted to make sure
that all this was handled correctly.

01:57:28.160 --> 01:57:29.321
Of course.

01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:34.166
So...

01:57:35.440 --> 01:57:38.762
You should know that I won't be taking
that deal that you offered.

01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:43.044
I would never accept felony charges
for anything that we've done.

01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:45.611
I know.

01:57:47.160 --> 01:57:49.020
I'm not a felon.

01:57:49.120 --> 01:57:50.724
That's probably true.

01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:56.180
But I also can't have you digging around
in my life for the next 10 years...

01:57:56.280 --> 01:57:58.123
hanging this around my neck.

01:57:59.200 --> 01:58:01.043
Look, I love a good battle...

01:58:01.880 --> 01:58:04.451
but this is very bad for my business.

01:58:05.120 --> 01:58:07.646
So we need to come
to some sort of conclusion.

01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.284
We can probably do that.

01:58:11.640 --> 01:58:12.846
Good.

01:58:14.560 --> 01:58:17.006
So I hear you closed
on this terminal today.

01:58:18.080 --> 01:58:19.700
Yeah, it looks that way.

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:22.531
I didn't realize this was
what you had in the works.

01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:26.371
Yeah. For a very long time.

01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:30.420
This could put you in quite
a powerful position.

01:58:30.520 --> 01:58:33.205
I mean, you get this place
up and running...

01:58:34.320 --> 01:58:36.448
it'll have significant influence...

01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:39.525
politically speaking.

01:58:42.680 --> 01:58:44.842
We all have our ambitions, Abel.

01:58:46.560 --> 01:58:48.961
And sometimes we need help to get there.

01:58:52.520 --> 01:58:54.010
Yes.

01:58:55.680 --> 01:58:57.682
You've come a very long way.

01:58:58.920 --> 01:59:01.241
In a very short time.

01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:03.010
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

01:59:04.760 --> 01:59:08.446
But you should know that I have always
taken the path that is most right.

01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:10.883
Most right?

01:59:11.560 --> 01:59:14.962
The result is never in question for me.

01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:18.889
Just what path do you take to get there.

01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:23.540
And there is always one
that is most right...

01:59:23.640 --> 01:59:25.449
and that is what this is.

01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:30.645
I hope so.
