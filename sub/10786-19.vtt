WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.750
WHAT ARE YOU
SO SMILEY ABOUT,
DAWSON?

00:03.750 --> 00:05.792
LOOK AT US, JO.
WHAT HAVE WE BECOME?

00:05.792 --> 00:07.166
CARE TO EXPOUND?

00:07.166 --> 00:09.291
SPRING BREAK.
MOST KIDS OUR AGE

00:09.291 --> 00:12.041
GO VISIT SOME EXOTIC,
SUN-DRENCHED LOCALE,

00:12.041 --> 00:15.750
DON SKIMPY BATHING SUITS,
AND INGEST MASS QUANTITIES
OF LIQUOR.

00:15.750 --> 00:17.166
WHAT DO WE DO?
WE GO VISIT MY AUNT.

00:17.166 --> 00:20.667
IT'S A RITUAL.
IT WAS OUR RITUAL.

00:20.667 --> 00:21.834
I'M GLAD WE'RE GOING.
I LOVE AUNT GWEN.

00:21.834 --> 00:24.291
AND SHE LOVES YOU.

00:24.291 --> 00:26.708
I CAN'T BELIEVE
SHE'S SELLING HER HOUSE.

00:26.708 --> 00:30.083
I KNOW. IT FEELS LIKE
THE END OF AN ERA.

00:30.083 --> 00:32.667
DO YOU THINK WE CAN
ROPE JACK AND ANDIE

00:32.667 --> 00:34.792
INTO ONE OF OUR
FAMOUS LATE-NIGHT
KARAOKE SESSIONS?

00:34.792 --> 00:36.750
OK. I THOUGHT
WE HAD AGREED

00:36.750 --> 00:37.792
TO GO ON LIVING
THE REST OF OUR LIVES

00:37.792 --> 00:40.333
AS IF THEY NEVER HAPPENED.

00:40.333 --> 00:42.917
DAWSON LEERY, ASHAMED
OF HIS OWN ROOTS.

00:42.917 --> 00:45.583
YOU LOVE THAT
KARAOKE MACHINE,
AND YOU KNOW IT.

00:45.583 --> 00:48.542
HEY, GUYS.
LOOK WHAT I FOUND.

00:48.542 --> 00:51.792
THIS CAN'T BE
WHO I THINK IT IS.
WILL KRUDSKI?

00:51.792 --> 00:52.959
HEY.

00:52.959 --> 00:55.125
LAST TIME I SAW YOU
WAS IN THIRD GRADE,

00:55.125 --> 00:56.667
KICKING PACEY'S BUTT
AROUND THE PLAYGROUND.

00:56.667 --> 00:59.959
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED
TO DO? HE WAS CALLING
ME "WILL KRUDDY."

00:59.959 --> 01:02.458
IT'S A GOOD THING
YOU MOVED TO
NEW RALEIGH, PAL,

01:02.458 --> 01:04.375
'CAUSE WITHOUT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT, I BECAME
KING OF THE PLAYGROUND.

01:04.375 --> 01:08.375
SO, UH, WHAT
BRINGS YOU TO
CAPESIDE, WILL?

01:08.375 --> 01:10.375
THOUGHT I'D SURPRISE
AN OLD FRIEND.

01:10.375 --> 01:12.750
AND, UH, IN THE SPIRIT
OF FRIENDSHIP,

01:12.750 --> 01:14.542
I TOOK THE LIBERTY
OF TELLIN' WILL HERE

01:14.542 --> 01:18.583
THAT MAYBE YOU GUYS WOULD
HAVE ROOM FOR TWO MORE ON
YOUR LITTLE IMPROMPTU JOURNEY?

01:18.583 --> 01:19.708
I DON'T HAVE
A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

01:19.708 --> 01:22.208
I'M NOT INTRUDING?
NO, NOT AT ALL.

01:22.208 --> 01:23.834
BESIDES, THE LIST
OF THINGS TO DO
IN CAPESIDE

01:23.834 --> 01:25.250
WHEN YOU'RE 16
IS WOEFULLY SHORT.

01:25.250 --> 01:26.583
HEY, GUYS!

01:26.583 --> 01:30.250
WHUH-OH. BEWARE OF McPHEES
BEARING TOO MUCH LUGGAGE.

01:30.250 --> 01:30.834
OH, THANKS.

01:30.834 --> 01:33.083
WHERE'S JACKERS?

01:33.083 --> 01:35.250
HE BAILED
IN FAVOR OF SPENDING
QUALITY TIME WITH DAD.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.041
OH. WHO'S THE
KINDHEARTED GENTLEMAN?

01:37.041 --> 01:39.417
WILL.
NICE TO MEET
YOU, WILL.

01:39.417 --> 01:41.083
I'M ANDIE.
LET ME HELP
YOU HERE.

01:41.083 --> 01:42.375
GREAT. THANKS.

01:46.375 --> 01:47.375
HEY.

01:48.375 --> 01:49.917
HEY.

01:49.917 --> 01:51.333
SO, UM...

01:51.333 --> 01:54.959
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
SITTING THIS ONE
OUT, PACEY.

01:54.959 --> 01:58.708
I WAS...
UNTIL WILL SHOWED UP
ON MY FRONT DOORSTEP,

01:58.708 --> 02:03.917
AND, UH, JUST THOUGHT
I SHOULD SHOW HIM
A GOOD TIME...

02:03.917 --> 02:06.959
AND...

02:06.959 --> 02:08.542
AND?

02:09.792 --> 02:13.291
AND THEY COULD
PROBABLY USE A HAND
UP THERE, SO...

03:14.000 --> 03:16.083
OK. YOU HAVE
GOT TO STOP TRYING
TO IMPRESS ME, HENRY.

03:16.083 --> 03:18.792
IT WAS THE COACH'S IDEA.

03:18.792 --> 03:21.458
HE SAID IF I WAS GONNA
BE HANGING AROUND YOU
SO MUCH,

03:21.458 --> 03:23.834
I MIGHT AS WELL
HELP OUT.

03:23.834 --> 03:24.708
WHAT?

03:24.708 --> 03:27.834
I WAS JUST WONDERING
HOW MANY GUYS

03:27.834 --> 03:30.250
WOULD SPEND THEIR SPRING
BREAK IN A FISH EATERY

03:30.250 --> 03:32.792
JUST TO BE
IN CLOSE PROXIMITY
TO THEIR GIRLFRIEND.

03:32.792 --> 03:34.083
YOU'RE A SAINT.

03:34.083 --> 03:37.041
WELL, YOU KNOW
WHAT THEY SAY--

03:37.041 --> 03:40.667
THERE'S A FINE LINE
BETWEEN SAINT
AND MORON.

03:49.375 --> 03:49.959
WHO'S THE NEW B-BOY?

03:49.959 --> 03:53.208
OH, THAT'S HENRY.

03:53.208 --> 03:55.041
HE'S A FUNNY
LITTLE CREATURE.

03:55.041 --> 03:56.208
MAKE THAT A YUMMY
LITTLE CREATURE.

03:56.208 --> 04:00.542
HE IS SO MY TYPE--
TALL, LANKY,

04:00.542 --> 04:02.875
A BRANCH RIGHT OFF
THE DiCAPRIO
FAMILY TREE.

04:02.875 --> 04:03.875
YEAH, YOU THINK?

04:03.875 --> 04:06.208
I DEFINITELY THINK.

04:06.208 --> 04:09.542
HE'S GOT THAT
CUTE LITTLE RAGAMUFFIN-
WITH-A-DREAM LOOK.

04:09.542 --> 04:13.000
MAKES YOU WANT
TO TAKE HIM HOME
AND GIVE HIM A BATH.

04:13.000 --> 04:16.208
AND THEN MAYBE HOP
IN THE TUB WITH HIM,
AND, UM...

04:16.208 --> 04:20.083
OK. SHELLY, I THINK THAT
TABLE 19 NEEDS THEIR CHECK.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.416
THEY JUST GOT
THEIR CHECK.

04:21.416 --> 04:22.625
THEN I'M SURE THAT
SOMEWHERE OUT THERE,

04:22.625 --> 04:26.917
SOMEBODY'S IN DIRE NEED
OF A DESSERT MENU, HUH?

04:31.458 --> 04:34.166
Andie: OK, WILL. QUICK
GET-TO-KNOW-YOU QUIZ:

04:34.166 --> 04:35.917
FAVORITE MOVIE?

04:35.917 --> 04:37.333
WELL, WHEN I WAS
ABOUT 5 YEARS OLD,

04:37.333 --> 04:40.875
MY DAD TOOK ME
TO A REVIVAL OF
PLANET OF THE APES,

04:40.875 --> 04:45.083
WHICH, IF YOU KNEW
MY DAD, IS A REALLY
BIG THING, SO...

04:45.083 --> 04:46.583
I'D HAVE TO SAY
THAT RANKS
AS MY FAVORITE.

04:47.959 --> 04:49.625
BUT I'M REALLY
MORE OF A BOOK GUY.

04:49.625 --> 04:52.625
FAVORITE MOVIE DOESN'T
STAR ADAM SANDLER
OR STEVEN SEAGAL,

04:52.625 --> 04:53.708
AND HE LIKES TO READ.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.500
YOU SURE HE'S
YOUR FRIEND, PACEY?

04:57.458 --> 04:58.625
OK, FAVORITE BOOK?

04:58.625 --> 05:00.500
THAT'S EASY--
CATCHER IN THE RYE.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.708
SALINGER'S A GOD.

05:02.708 --> 05:04.708
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO BE
WHEN YOU GROW UP?

05:04.708 --> 05:06.291
I DON'T KNOW.

05:06.291 --> 05:08.166
JUST HAPPY, I GUESS.

05:08.166 --> 05:10.000
YOU'LL GET ALONG GREAT
WITH MY AUNT GWEN.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.458
SHE'S ANOTHER
SALINGER FREAK.

05:11.458 --> 05:14.000
WHAT'S YOUR
AUNT GWEN LIKE?

05:14.000 --> 05:15.291
SHE'S AN ARTIST.

05:15.291 --> 05:16.208
A PAINTER.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.250
SHE'S INCREDIBLY
TALENTED.

05:17.250 --> 05:19.083
SHE PAINTS,
AND SHE READS
GREAT BOOKS,

05:19.083 --> 05:21.542
AND SHE DOES
YOGA, AND...

05:21.542 --> 05:23.834
SHE LIVES LIFE
ON HER OWN
TERMS.

05:23.834 --> 05:25.125
Andie:
IS SHE MARRIED?

05:25.125 --> 05:27.750
Dawson: SHE WAS ONCE,
TO THIS UPTIGHT LAWYER.

05:27.750 --> 05:30.834
SHE HAD THIS
PICTURE-PERFECT
SUBURBAN LIFE,

05:30.834 --> 05:32.250
AND THEN
SHE MET RICHARD,

05:32.250 --> 05:34.208
WHO WAS THIS
CRAZY, BEARDED PAINTER

05:34.208 --> 05:36.125
ABOUT 20 YEARS OLDER
THAN HER.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.208
SHE LEFT HER HUSBAND
FOR HIM AND NEVER
LOOKED BACK.

05:38.208 --> 05:40.458
WE GONNA GET TO MEET
THIS WIFE-STEALING
PICASSO?

05:40.458 --> 05:42.667
UNFORTUNATELY,
THEIR HAPPILY-EVER-AFTER

05:42.667 --> 05:43.834
ONLY LASTED
A COUPLE YEARS.

05:43.834 --> 05:47.000
RICHARD DIED
ABOUT A YEAR AGO
OF A HEART ATTACK.

05:47.000 --> 05:49.333
WOW. THAT'S SAD.

05:49.333 --> 05:51.500
I DON'T KNOW.
ISN'T IT BETTER

05:51.500 --> 05:54.250
TO HAVE A SHORT TIME
WITH SOMEBODY YOU REALLY LOVE

05:54.250 --> 05:55.667
THAN A LIFETIME
WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S
BASICALLY YOUR ROOMMATE?

05:58.125 --> 06:01.083
JUST A THOUGHT.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.500
HEY, YOU TWO.
LONG TIME NO SEE?

06:04.500 --> 06:06.250
MEGAN.
OH, MY GOD!

06:06.250 --> 06:08.291
WHAT
ARE YOU DOING
IN CAPESIDE?

06:08.291 --> 06:09.458
HEY! HOW ARE YOU?

06:09.458 --> 06:12.333
WHERE'S TOM?
IS HE OUTSIDE?

06:12.333 --> 06:13.542
WE SHOULD TALK.

06:13.542 --> 06:17.125
I AM SO SORRY, HONEY.

06:17.125 --> 06:19.417
HE WAS A WONDERFUL GUY.

06:19.417 --> 06:21.708
HE WAS, WASN'T HE?

06:21.708 --> 06:24.750
I MEAN, SURE,
WE HAD OUR PROBLEMS,

06:24.750 --> 06:27.667
BUT LOOKING BACK NOW,
IT JUST ALL SEEMS
SO STUPID AND PETTY.

06:27.667 --> 06:29.583
HE WAS ONE
OF THE GOOD ONES.

06:29.583 --> 06:32.708
I GUESS THAT MAKES ME
ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES.

06:32.708 --> 06:38.375
OK...LET ME
SEGUE OUT OF THIS
GRIEVING WIDOW ROUTINE.

06:38.375 --> 06:41.708
HOW THE HELL
ARE YOU GUYS?

06:41.708 --> 06:42.875
WELL, ACTUALLY--

06:42.875 --> 06:44.667
WE'RE GREAT.

06:44.667 --> 06:46.917
WE'RE DOING
JUST GREAT.

06:46.917 --> 06:50.917
DAWSON'S 16 NOW
AND A BIG BUNDLE
OF PRECOCIOUS ANGST,

06:50.917 --> 06:52.375
BUT HE'S
A TERRIFIC KID.

06:52.375 --> 06:55.125
I SEE YOU FOLLOWED THROUGH
AND MADE THE RESTAURANT
A REALITY.

06:55.125 --> 06:58.250
IT'S INSPIRING, REALLY.

06:58.250 --> 07:00.959
SO MANY DREAMS
NEVER COME TRUE.

07:02.417 --> 07:03.750
OH, I ALMOST FORGOT.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.917
I WAS RUMMAGING
THROUGH SOME
OF TOM'S STUFF.

07:06.917 --> 07:08.500
YOU SHOULD
HAVE THIS.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.750
IT'S THE TOAST
FROM YOUR WEDDING.

07:10.750 --> 07:12.834
I CAN STILL SEE TOM
STAYING UP TILL 4:00
IN THE MORNING

07:12.834 --> 07:17.500
THE NIGHT BEFORE,
JUST TRYING TO
GET IT PERFECT.

07:27.583 --> 07:28.667
COME ON IN.

07:29.041 --> 07:31.083
HELLO.

07:33.000 --> 07:33.834
HELLO.

07:33.834 --> 07:37.000
OH, DAWSON!
BABY, YOU MADE IT!

07:37.000 --> 07:38.708
HI! MMM!

07:38.708 --> 07:45.208
JOEY. HOW
GORGEOUS DID YOU
TURN OUT! WOW!

07:45.208 --> 07:47.959
AND THIS MUST
BE PACEY.

07:47.959 --> 07:50.166
I SEE MY REPUTATION
PRECEDES ME.

07:50.166 --> 07:51.667
ACTUALLY,
WE'VE MET BEFORE.

07:51.667 --> 07:52.917
WE HAVE?

07:52.917 --> 07:54.875
YEAH. I WOULDN'T
EXPECT YOU
TO REMEMBER IT.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.583
IT WAS YEARS AGO
AT MY SISTER'S
4th OF JULY PICNIC,

07:57.583 --> 08:00.834
AND YOU WERE CHASING
THIS ONE AROUND

08:00.834 --> 08:03.375
AND TEASING HER
MERCILESSLY.

08:03.375 --> 08:06.375
AND WHEN I WENT
TO INTERVENE,
YOU SAID TO ME,

08:06.375 --> 08:08.083
"HEY, LADY,
STEP ON MY BUZZ,
WHY DON'T YA?"

08:08.083 --> 08:09.083
BOOP.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.375
HA HA HA!

08:11.375 --> 08:12.750
THAT SOUNDS
ABOUT RIGHT.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.375
WHICH WOULD MAKE
YOU...ANDIE?

08:15.375 --> 08:17.458
YUP. NICE TO MEET
YOU, AUNT GWEN.

08:17.458 --> 08:19.667
HI.
HI.

08:19.667 --> 08:24.083
AND THIS...
HAS GOT TO BE...
JACK, RIGHT?

08:24.083 --> 08:25.792
UH, NO. JACKERS
COULDN'T MAKE IT
THIS WEEKEND,

08:25.792 --> 08:29.250
SO, AUNT GWEN,
PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO INTRODUCE

08:29.250 --> 08:30.500
MY FRIEND,
WILL KRUDSKI.

08:30.500 --> 08:31.417
HOW YOU DOIN'?

08:31.417 --> 08:33.457
HUH. FRIEND OF PACEY'S.

08:33.457 --> 08:34.332
NOT A GOOD SIGN.

08:34.332 --> 08:35.792
Pacey: HEH HEH.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.166
HEY.

08:46.333 --> 08:49.166
TELL ME, PACEY,
IS OUR CONVERSATION
THIS WEEK

08:49.166 --> 08:52.375
GOING TO
CONSIST SOLELY OF
MONOSYLLABIC GRUNTS?

08:52.375 --> 08:55.000
JO, THIS IS NEITHER
THE TIME NOR THE PLACE

08:55.000 --> 08:56.458
TO BE DISCUSSING EVENTS
OF WEEKS PAST.

08:56.458 --> 08:58.959
LOOK, WHO WANTS
TO DISCUSS?

08:58.959 --> 09:02.291
I THOUGHT WE
AGREED THAT IT WAS
A "NO BIG DEAL."

09:02.291 --> 09:04.708
IT ISN'T.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.625
FINE. SO...

09:06.625 --> 09:09.875
THERE SHOULD BE
NO WEIRDNESS
BETWEEN US?

09:09.875 --> 09:11.583
RIGHT. YOU'RE RIGHT...

09:11.583 --> 09:14.250
but I think we may
have a small problem.

09:19.834 --> 09:22.041
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING ME.

09:22.041 --> 09:25.208
PACEY, DO SOMETHING
ABOUT THIS.

09:33.166 --> 09:34.542
UH, DAWSON.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.041
HEY, DAWSON.

09:37.000 --> 09:38.542
WHAT?

09:38.542 --> 09:41.667
LOOK, UH...
WHAT SAY YOU HOP UP

09:41.667 --> 09:43.583
AND GIVE JOEY HERE
YOUR SLEEPING BAG, HUH?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.375
AND HOP IN THE SACK
WITH YOU?

09:45.375 --> 09:47.375
ESSENTIALLY, YEAH.

09:47.375 --> 09:48.708
GOOD NIGHT, PACEY.

09:51.500 --> 09:52.375
ANDIE.

09:52.375 --> 09:55.417
[GRUNTS, SNORTS]

09:55.417 --> 09:57.875
Andie!

10:00.583 --> 10:03.417
I'M NOT SLEEPIN'
WITH YOU, PACEY.

10:03.417 --> 10:07.917
AND, JOEY, I DON'T THINK
WE KNOW EACH OTHER
WELL ENOUGH.

10:07.917 --> 10:08.917
NO OFFENSE.

10:08.917 --> 10:10.625
NONE TAKEN.

10:12.083 --> 10:14.708
OK, WE'RE JUST GONNA
HAVE TO MAKE THE BEST
OF THIS, ALL RIGHT?

10:17.083 --> 10:19.125
FINE.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
BUT IF I SO MUCH
AS FEEL ANYTHING--

10:20.375 --> 10:21.750
JO...
GET IN BED.

10:21.750 --> 10:24.708
AND WHILE YOU'RE AT IT,
GET OVER YOURSELF.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.250
PACEY, GET YOUR BUTT
AWAY FROM ME.

10:36.250 --> 10:39.792
MY BUTT WANTS
NOTHING TO DO
WITH YOUR BUTT, OK?

10:39.792 --> 10:42.834
GIMME SOME OF
THESE COVERS, MAN.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.667
JO--

10:45.375 --> 10:46.667
JO.

10:50.208 --> 10:51.834
[SIGHS]

11:24.000 --> 11:26.000
Gwen: SLEEPYHEADS,
BREAKFAST!

11:28.500 --> 11:30.500
[GROANS]

11:30.500 --> 11:32.041
OH, MAN.

11:32.041 --> 11:33.000
[YAWNS]

11:33.000 --> 11:35.083
SO GLAD YOU COULD
JOIN US, YOU TWO.

11:35.083 --> 11:39.250
I HAVE A SPECTACULAR
DINNER PLANNED
FOR THIS EVENING,

11:39.250 --> 11:41.000
BUT FIRST, I MUST SHOP,

11:41.000 --> 11:44.625
AND I'M GOING TO STEAL
DAWSON AND JOEY TO HELP ME.

11:44.625 --> 11:46.333
THE REST OF YOU
I ENCOURAGE TO EXPLORE

11:46.333 --> 11:51.583
THE SOMEWHAT LIMITED CHARMS
OF MY HUMBLE LITTLE
PODUNK TOWN.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.041
WE DON'T HAVE
MUCH IN THE WAY
OF ENTERTAINMENT--

11:53.041 --> 11:55.041
THERE'S NO MULTIPLEX,
NO MONSTER TRUCK SHOW--

11:55.041 --> 11:59.291
BUT WE DO HAVE
THIS KICK-ASS
LITTLE POOL HALL.

11:59.291 --> 12:00.333
I LOVE
TO PLAY POOL.

12:00.333 --> 12:02.667
I'M ALWAYS DOWN FOR
SOME BILLIARD ACTION.

12:02.667 --> 12:05.041
WHAT IS IT WITH
GUYS AND POOL?

12:05.041 --> 12:06.375
IT'S A PHALLIC
THING, RIGHT?

12:06.375 --> 12:07.875
I'LL TEACH YOU.

12:07.875 --> 12:11.583
OK. YOU'RE  GONNA
TEACH ME HOW TO HIT
A BALL WITH A STICK?

12:11.583 --> 12:13.417
THERE'S AN ART
TO IT, YOU KNOW?

12:13.417 --> 12:14.875
OH, OK.
I GET IT.

12:14.875 --> 12:16.208
SO YOU'RE, LIKE,

12:16.208 --> 12:17.250
UH...TOM CRUISE,
COLOR OF MONEY?

12:17.250 --> 12:20.333
RIGHT. MM-HMM.

12:23.208 --> 12:25.250
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT,
YOU KNOW.

12:25.250 --> 12:27.000
I'M JUST TRYIN'
TO HELP OUT.

12:28.875 --> 12:31.583
YOU OK?
DO YOU WANT TO TALK?

12:31.583 --> 12:32.959
ABOUT?

12:32.959 --> 12:34.917
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

12:34.917 --> 12:36.875
A FRIEND OF OURS
DIED, GALE.

12:36.875 --> 12:41.917
IT ROYALLY SUCKS...
BUT IT HAPPENED.

12:41.917 --> 12:44.250
AND IT'S REALLY SAD,
BUT...

12:44.250 --> 12:46.875
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THERE IS TO TALK ABOUT.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.375
WELL, IT MUST
MAKE YOU FEEL
A CERTAIN WAY.

12:48.375 --> 12:52.708
I KNOW IT DOES ME.

12:52.708 --> 12:55.333
I WISH I'D
CALLED HIM MORE.

12:55.333 --> 12:58.083
I WISH HE'D
CALLED ME MORE.

12:58.083 --> 13:00.458
I WISH A LOT OF THINGS.

13:02.375 --> 13:02.917
YOU SHOULD READ THIS.

13:06.458 --> 13:07.583
WHY?

13:07.583 --> 13:09.750
BECAUSE
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
HIS WORDS.

13:09.750 --> 13:11.750
I DIDN'T REMEMBER.

13:11.750 --> 13:16.542
IT WAS NICE TO GO BACK
AND SEE US THROUGH
HIS EYES FOR A MOMENT.

13:16.542 --> 13:18.125
I'D RATHER NOT.

13:21.041 --> 13:22.625
WHAT IS WRONG
WITH YOU?

13:22.625 --> 13:23.834
NOTHING.
I JUST DON'T FEEL

13:23.834 --> 13:27.166
LIKE A TRIP DOWN
MEMORY LANE RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S ALL.

13:32.458 --> 13:34.000
[SHELLY GIGGLING]

13:38.792 --> 13:40.250
HI.

13:40.250 --> 13:41.208
HEY, JEN.

13:41.208 --> 13:42.834
HOW ADORABLE
IS THIS BOY?

13:42.834 --> 13:44.208
CAN YOU TELL ME?

13:44.208 --> 13:45.792
HEH HEH, YEAH,
HE'S DREAMY.

13:45.792 --> 13:48.000
LISTEN, SHEL,
I NEED YOU TO COVER
SECTIONS 5 AND 6 TODAY.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.125
5 AND  6?
LINDLEY, THAT'S
CRAZY TALK.

13:51.125 --> 13:53.125
I'M SORRY, HON.
WE'RE A LITTLE
SHORT-STAFFED.

13:53.125 --> 13:54.583
I NEED YOU TO BE
A TEAM PLAYER HERE.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.083
[SIGHS] BYE, HENRY.

13:58.083 --> 13:59.750
UH...BYE.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.458
YOU--YOU KNOW WE
WERE JUST TALKING,
RIGHT?

14:06.458 --> 14:08.250
[CHUCKLES] WELL,
OF COURSE YOU WERE.

14:08.250 --> 14:11.083
YOU JUST SEEMED
A LITTLE JEALOUS.

14:11.083 --> 14:14.667
[CHUCKLES] JEALOUS?

14:14.667 --> 14:17.667
PLEASE, HENRY,
I'M SO NOT IN TOUCH
WITH THAT EMOTION.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.834
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT WOULD FEEL LIKE.

14:19.834 --> 14:22.125
JEALOUS.
THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.208
WH-WHAT?
IT'S RIDICULOUS
TO THINK

14:24.208 --> 14:27.333
THAT SOMEONE ELSE MIGHT
FIND ME TO BE A DECENT,
WORTHWHILE HUMAN BEING?

14:27.333 --> 14:29.917
OH, THAT'S NOT
WHAT I MEANT.

14:29.917 --> 14:31.375
WHATEVER.

14:38.000 --> 14:39.000
[CHUCKLES]

14:39.000 --> 14:41.083
OK. TOM CRUISE.
COLOR OF MONEY.

14:41.083 --> 14:43.000
RIGHT. YOU SUCK.

14:43.000 --> 14:45.542
EASY, McPHEE.
THEM'S FIGHTIN' WORDS.

14:45.542 --> 14:49.208
I THOUGHT HE WAS
SUPPOSED TO BE THIS
AMAZING POOL PLAYER.

14:49.208 --> 14:50.166
I NEVER CLAIMED
TO BE ANYTHING.

14:50.166 --> 14:52.834
I JUST SAID
I LIKE TO PLAY.

14:52.834 --> 14:56.083
OHO. AND YOU SAID,
IN A SOMEWHAT
CONDESCENDING FASHION,

14:56.083 --> 14:57.667
THAT YOU'D TEACH ME.

15:00.583 --> 15:03.375
AHHH! LOOKS LIKE
I SHOULD BE THE ONE
GIVING THE LESSONS.

15:03.375 --> 15:05.208
WHAT DO YOU SAY, PACEY?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.125
MAYBE YOU SHOULD CUT
THE GUY SOME SLACK.

15:07.125 --> 15:09.458
THERE MIGHT JUST
BE SOME METHOD
TO HIS MADNESS.

15:13.875 --> 15:16.708
OK. ALL I HAVE
TO SAY RIGHT NOW
IS LITTLE OL' ME

15:16.708 --> 15:17.708
IS WIPIN' UP THE FLOOR
WITH THE TWO OF YOU.

15:17.708 --> 15:21.083
[CHUCKLES]
UM, SORRY, MAN.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.166
I JUST CAN'T SEEM
TO KEEP THOSE THINGS
ON THE TABLE.

15:23.166 --> 15:25.500
YOU GUYS INTERESTED
IN A GAME?

15:25.500 --> 15:27.125
UH, NO. [CHUCKLES]
LOOK, MISTER, THESE TWO,

15:27.125 --> 15:30.792
THEY'RE
SERIOUSLY DELUDED
AND TOTALLY LAME,

15:30.792 --> 15:33.000
SO I'M GONNA SET
THE RECORD STRAIGHT
RIGHT HERE AND NOW.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.792
IT WOULD BE
BOTH SICK AND WRONG
TO TAKE THEIR MONEY.

15:36.792 --> 15:37.250
WE'LL PLAY.

15:41.750 --> 15:43.083
WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKIN' FOR?

15:43.083 --> 15:44.333
SOMETHING
FOR MY WALL.

15:44.333 --> 15:46.250
AH, WHICH,
AS I RECALL CORRECTLY,

15:46.250 --> 15:49.542
IS PLASTERED
IN WALL-TO-WALL
MOVIE POSTERS.

15:49.542 --> 15:51.875
YOU KNOW, SOMEHOW
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS GONNA GO

15:51.875 --> 15:54.875
WITH THAT WHOLE
FILM GEEK AESTHETIC
YOU'VE GOT GOIN' ON.

15:54.875 --> 15:58.417
THE POSTERS
ARE GONE, ACTUALLY.
I TOOK 'EM ALL DOWN.

15:58.417 --> 16:00.333
AMISTAD  WASN'T
THAT  BAD, HONEY.

16:00.333 --> 16:02.834
[CHUCKLES] MORE LIKE
A CRISIS OF FAITH,
ACTUALLY.

16:02.834 --> 16:04.875
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

16:04.875 --> 16:08.291
WELL...I GUESS I GOT
TIRED OF HAVING THIS
LARGER-THAN-LIFE-DREAM

16:08.291 --> 16:11.125
TO COMPENSATE FOR
MY SMALLER-THAN-LIFE
LIFE.

16:11.125 --> 16:14.583
OK. SO...
THE MOVIE POSTERS
ARE DOWN.

16:14.583 --> 16:16.959
FILM HAS LOST
ITS LUSTER.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.792
AND I AM DETECTING
A SIGNIFICANT LACK

16:19.792 --> 16:21.625
OF...SMOOCHING,

16:21.625 --> 16:24.917
HAND-HOLDING,
GENERAL ALL-AROUND
CUDDLINESS

16:24.917 --> 16:26.250
BETWEEN THE TWO
OF YOU?

16:27.291 --> 16:29.625
SO...COME ON.
TELL ME EVERYTHING.

16:29.625 --> 16:34.250
WELL, TO MAKE A LONG
SOAP OPERA SHORT, UM,
WE GOT TOGETHER--

16:34.250 --> 16:36.208
WHICH WAS SO
COMPLETELY OVERWHELMING
THAT IT FORCED ME

16:36.208 --> 16:38.583
TO RETREAT INTO THIS
LONG, PROTRACTED PERIOD
OF SOUL SEARCHING.

16:38.583 --> 16:41.500
WHICH SENT ME INTO
A DIZZYING DOWNWARD
SPIRAL OF DEPRESSION.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.375
AND THEN I FINALLY
MANAGED TO GET HER BACK,
BUT--

16:43.375 --> 16:44.917
Joey: IT WAS
EXCEPTIONALLY
BAD TIMING.

16:44.917 --> 16:46.542
AND THEN HE GOT BACK
FROM SUMMER VACATION.

16:46.542 --> 16:49.625
THE POSSIBILITY OF
HAVING MY HEART RIPPED
OUT OF MY CHEST ONCE AGAIN

16:49.625 --> 16:51.083
DIDN'T SOUND AS APPEALING
AS IT ONCE HAD,
SO I DECIDED

16:51.083 --> 16:53.708
MAYBE IT WOULD BE BEST
JUST TO BE FRIENDS.

16:53.708 --> 16:56.083
AND THEN HE ASKED PACEY
TO LOOK OUT FOR ME.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.250
WHAT DOES PACEY
HAVE TO DO WITH IT?

16:59.875 --> 17:00.750
UH...NOTHING.

17:00.750 --> 17:04.165
BUT...JUST...
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

17:04.165 --> 17:05.834
WELL, THEN I HAVE
JUST ONE QUESTION.

17:05.834 --> 17:08.875
WHY AREN'T
THE TWO OF YOU
TOGETHER NOW?

17:09.834 --> 17:11.000
YOU
HUSTLED THEM!

17:11.000 --> 17:13.625
AND THIS IS
A BIG DEAL. WHY?

17:13.625 --> 17:15.666
BECAUSE I FIND IT
MORALLY WRONG

17:15.666 --> 17:17.375
AND OFFENSIVE
AND DISGUSTING.

17:17.375 --> 17:18.708
I MEAN, I DIDN'T
COME HERE WITH YOU GUYS

17:18.708 --> 17:22.290
TO BE, YOU KNOW,
AN ACCOMPLICE TO YOUR
LITTLE SEEDY SCAM.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.791
ANDY,
WILL'S A SHARK.
HE ALWAYS HAS BEEN.

17:23.791 --> 17:26.916
WHAT ARE YOU
GONNA DO?

17:28.083 --> 17:29.875
I MEAN,
YOU LET ME THINK
THAT I WAS GOOD.

17:29.875 --> 17:31.834
YOU ARE  GOOD.

17:31.834 --> 17:33.375
I AM?

17:33.750 --> 17:35.583
SURE.

17:35.583 --> 17:38.041
OK, YOU'RE HUSTLING ME
RIGHT NOW, AREN'T YOU?

17:38.041 --> 17:38.333
MAYBE.

17:40.375 --> 17:41.667
WHAT'S THIS?

17:41.667 --> 17:43.458
IT'S YOUR SHARE
OF THE TAKE.

17:50.208 --> 17:50.708
[LAUGHING]

17:50.708 --> 17:52.750
AAH!
AAH!

17:52.750 --> 17:54.625

LET'S CLEAN 'EM!

17:54.625 --> 17:55.583
OH, DON'T!

17:55.583 --> 17:56.250
DON'T!
AAH!

HA HA HA!
AAH! AAH!

HA HA HA!

18:01.041 --> 18:02.041
[SHOUTING AND LAUGHING
CONTINUE]

18:02.041 --> 18:04.208
JOEY, DO I SEEM
DIFFERENT TO YOU?

18:04.208 --> 18:05.959
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

18:07.959 --> 18:09.417
I'VE DEVOTED
ALL THIS ENERGY

18:09.417 --> 18:12.500
TO...REINVENTING
MYSELF, AND...

18:12.500 --> 18:13.708
[CHUCKLES]

18:13.708 --> 18:15.625
TO BE HONEST,
I DON'T SEE
WHERE IT'S GOTTEN ME.

18:15.625 --> 18:18.041
I DON'T FEEL
ANY DIFFERENT.

18:19.667 --> 18:21.917
ACTUALLY, YOU
ARE  DIFFERENT,
DAWSON.

18:21.917 --> 18:25.625
ONCE UPON A TIME,
YOU HAD TO BE
THE CENTER OF ATTENTION.

18:25.625 --> 18:30.083
LIFE REVOLVED AROUND
YOU AND YOUR DREAMS.
AND RECENTLY,

18:30.083 --> 18:33.166
I'VE WATCHED YOU FADE
INTO THE BACKGROUND
AND LET OTHERS SHINE.

18:34.542 --> 18:36.041
YOU'RE
DIFFERENT.

18:38.166 --> 18:39.333
WHAT?

18:39.333 --> 18:41.875
THIS TRIP THIS WEEK
HAS...

18:42.750 --> 18:44.208
REMINDED ME OF WHAT
WE'RE GOOD AT.

18:46.667 --> 18:48.041
WHAT'S THAT?

18:49.208 --> 18:50.458
WE MAKE SENSE
OF EACH OTHER'S LIVES.

18:54.667 --> 18:56.041
WE ALWAYS HAVE.

18:57.250 --> 18:59.291
THINGS ARE CHANGING,
DAWSON.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.375
PEOPLE EVOLVE,
AND--AND...

19:04.458 --> 19:05.834
SOME THINGS DROP AWAY.

19:05.834 --> 19:08.375
YEAH, BUT THINGS
DON'T HAVE TO BE
ANY CERTAIN WAY, JOEY.

19:08.375 --> 19:11.917
GROWING UP DOES
NOT HAVE TO EQUAL
GROWING APART.

19:12.458 --> 19:14.458
SOMEHOW, IT DOES.

19:16.834 --> 19:18.792
YOU GOTTA FIND
SOME FAITH...

19:18.792 --> 19:21.125
FAITH THAT
WHATEVER SET US OFF
IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS

19:21.125 --> 19:23.291
IS THE SAME THING
THAT'LL...

19:23.291 --> 19:24.708
BRING US BACK TOGETHER.

19:24.708 --> 19:26.625
[SIGHS]

19:27.875 --> 19:29.417
I TAKE IT BACK.

19:30.500 --> 19:32.125
YOU HAVEN'T CHANGED A BIT.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.458
YOU'RE STILL
AN ETERNAL OPTIMIST,
DAWSON.

19:36.458 --> 19:38.166
MAYBE.

19:38.166 --> 19:39.375
IT'S JUST...

19:41.041 --> 19:42.375
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M STARTING TO FORGET WHY.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.667
WHY WHAT?

19:45.667 --> 19:47.458
WHY WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

19:49.625 --> 19:53.041
HEY, YOU GUYS
WANT TO COME DOWN
AND GIVE US A HAND?

20:08.208 --> 20:10.542
Joey: THAT ONE'S
MY FAVORITE, I THINK.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.917
WHEN I WAS MARRIED,
I WAS TAKING
THIS ART CLASS.

20:13.917 --> 20:15.625
AND THE FIRST THING
THE TEACHER SAID

20:15.625 --> 20:19.250
WAS, "CLOSE YOUR EYES
AND PAINT YOUR FUTURE,

20:19.250 --> 20:22.041
AND THE REST WILL
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF."

20:22.041 --> 20:24.417
AND IT DID.

20:25.417 --> 20:28.458
YOU PAINTED THIS
BEFORE YOU LIVED HERE?

20:35.917 --> 20:37.959
DO YOU HAVE ANY REGRETS?

20:37.959 --> 20:39.417
ABOUT?

20:39.417 --> 20:42.542
THE WAY IN WHICH
YOU AND RICHARD
CAME TOGETHER.

20:45.583 --> 20:47.542
YOU KNOW, JOEY...

20:47.542 --> 20:49.333
I GOT MARRIED
TOO YOUNG.

20:49.333 --> 20:51.333
AND I SOLD OUT
IN A BIG WAY.

20:51.333 --> 20:54.583
I STAYED
IN A RELATIONSHIP
THAT WAS SAFE

20:54.583 --> 20:57.083
AND COMFORTABLE, AND
THEN I MET THIS MAN,

20:57.083 --> 21:02.083
WHO MADE ME FEEL ALIVE
FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

21:02.083 --> 21:04.417
THOSE KINDS OF FEELINGS
JUST WON'T BE IGNORED,
YOU KNOW?

21:04.417 --> 21:08.041
I OWED IT TO MYSELF
TO EXPLORE THEM.

21:08.041 --> 21:10.208
COME HERE.

21:14.083 --> 21:16.417
NOW. THIS  ONE...

21:17.750 --> 21:19.917
THIS ONE
IS MY FAVORITE.

21:21.250 --> 21:23.041
DEFINITELY.

21:30.875 --> 21:32.125
HEY.

21:36.125 --> 21:37.375
HEY.

21:45.291 --> 21:47.917

WE WILL HAVE YOUR TABLE
AT 8:00, THEN.

21:47.917 --> 21:49.250
THANK YOU. BYE.

21:50.792 --> 21:53.708
UH...SHELLY
JUST OFFERED ME SEX.

21:53.708 --> 21:57.041
I JUST THOUGHT--
I THOUGHT YOU SHOULD
KNOW ABOUT IT.

21:57.041 --> 21:59.125
SHE WHAT?

21:59.125 --> 22:00.083
SHE BASICALLY SAID
I COULD HAVE SEX
WITH HER

22:00.083 --> 22:02.959
ANYTIME I WANTED.

22:02.959 --> 22:05.375
AP-APPARENTLY,
SHE LIKES YOUNGER GUYS.

22:07.166 --> 22:09.166
HENRY, YOUR HANDS
ARE SHAKING.

22:10.083 --> 22:13.875
A STRANGE GIRL
JUST OFFERED ME SEX.

22:13.875 --> 22:15.333
TH-THAT'S

33:44.208 --> 33:46.417
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I'M NOT CURIOUS

33:46.417 --> 33:48.291
ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON
IN THAT BUSY HEAD
OF YOURS.

33:48.291 --> 33:54.125
YOU WERE RIGHT...HENRY.
I WAS JEALOUS, AND...

33:54.125 --> 33:56.500
AND IT REALLY
FREAKED ME OUT.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.125
WHY?

33:58.125 --> 34:01.458
JEALOUSY'S
A PRETTY NATURAL
HUMAN EMOTION.

34:02.500 --> 34:04.333
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
I'VE...

34:06.542 --> 34:09.083
I'VE SPENT YEARS
BUILDING THIS...

34:09.083 --> 34:12.083
THIS COMPLEX SERIES
OF--OF BOOBY TRAPS

34:12.083 --> 34:15.542
SO THAT...NOBODY
WOULD EVER GET TOO CLOSE.

34:15.542 --> 34:17.792
[HALF CHUCKLES,
HALF SOBS]

34:17.792 --> 34:19.417
AND THEN YOU
CAME ALONG...

34:19.417 --> 34:22.667
WITH THAT BIG
BEATING HEART OF YOURS,
AND...

34:22.667 --> 34:26.625
YOU BROKE
ALL THOSE WALLS DOWN,
AND IT'S JUST REALLY SCARY.

34:26.625 --> 34:28.041
I MEAN...

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
WHAT IF I LOSE YOU?

34:36.250 --> 34:40.041
YOU KNOW, JEN, I WAS...
I WAS KINDA GLAD
THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS.

34:41.750 --> 34:43.041
YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT...

34:43.041 --> 34:46.542
'CAUSE I'M NOT
GOIN' ANYWHERE.

34:48.166 --> 34:50.333
AND IF I DIE TOMORROW,
SO BE IT.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.542
AT LEAST I DIED
KNOWING MY BIGGEST
DREAM CAME TRUE.

34:55.875 --> 34:57.083
WHAT'S THAT?

34:57.083 --> 34:59.250
SEEING YOU IN LINGERIE.

34:59.250 --> 35:00.250
[CHUCKLES]

35:00.250 --> 35:01.542
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

35:14.125 --> 35:16.375
WOULD YOU MIND...
COMING WITH ME
FOR A SECOND?

35:19.708 --> 35:20.959
OK.

35:24.000 --> 35:26.583
I WAS READING
THE TOAST...

35:26.583 --> 35:29.458
AND I GOT THIS URGE
TO SEE HIM AGAIN.

35:33.083 --> 35:35.834
[Mitch, continuing]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

35:35.834 --> 35:37.417
IT WAS  BEAUTIFUL.

35:41.625 --> 35:43.458
I HAD  TO LET YOU GO.

35:43.458 --> 35:46.750
I WANTED YOU TO STAY,
BUT...

35:46.750 --> 35:49.583
YOU SAID NO.
YOU WENT TO PHILLY,
AND...

35:51.291 --> 35:53.208
I HAD TO LET YOU GO.

35:54.375 --> 35:57.208
WELL, WHAT DOES
THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

35:58.458 --> 35:59.333
MORE THAN YOU REALIZE.

36:02.375 --> 36:05.500
TO REMEMBER WHAT WE WERE
IS PAINFUL FOR ME.

36:06.917 --> 36:08.333
UH, YESTERDAY...

36:09.917 --> 36:12.834
I WAS LOOKING AT MEGAN...

36:12.834 --> 36:16.333
THIS WOMAN WHO HAD LOST
THE LOVE OF HER LIFE.

36:18.542 --> 36:19.917
SUDDENLY...

36:19.917 --> 36:21.375
OUR PROBLEMS JUST SEEMED...

36:23.375 --> 36:25.125
TRIVIAL?

36:26.917 --> 36:28.792
OR EVEN PASSED.

36:33.458 --> 36:34.583
Gale: OH...

37:33.166 --> 37:35.917
HEY.
TAKE A LOOK
AT THESE.

37:37.041 --> 37:38.000
[CHUCKLES]

37:38.000 --> 37:40.000
WHAT A DORK I WAS.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.208
NO, YOU WEREN'T.

37:41.208 --> 37:43.834
WELL...
MAYBE A LITTLE.

37:43.834 --> 37:44.542
[CHUCKLES]

37:48.041 --> 37:49.083
CAN WE TALK?

37:49.083 --> 37:51.333
YEAH. WHAT'S UP?

37:55.250 --> 37:56.417
WELL, UH--

37:56.417 --> 37:59.208
UM...SORRY.
I'M INTERRUPTING
SOMETHING. I CAN--

37:59.208 --> 38:01.917
ACTUALLY, NO.
IT'S--IT'S OK.

38:01.917 --> 38:03.834
WE'LL...TALK LATER.

38:03.834 --> 38:05.250
OK.

38:10.125 --> 38:11.917
I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING FOR YOUR WALL.

38:11.917 --> 38:15.375
THOUGHT MAYBE
IT WOULD HELP YOU
FIND YOUR WAY BACK.

38:16.875 --> 38:18.125
WAY BACK TO WHAT?

38:18.125 --> 38:19.417
WELL...

38:19.417 --> 38:22.000
BACK TO THOSE THINGS
THAT MADE YOU

38:22.000 --> 38:24.542
THIS LITTLE...
DAYDREAM BELIEVER.

38:28.500 --> 38:30.458
LOOK, DAWSON, I KNOW
YOU CAN'T SEE IT
RIGHT NOW,

38:30.458 --> 38:34.000
BUT YOU ARE
A VERY TALENTED
YOUNG MAN

38:34.000 --> 38:38.125
WITH A RICH
AND POWERFUL
IMAGINATION.

38:38.125 --> 38:41.750
YOUR DREAMS ARE...
THEY'RE AN ASSET,
NOT A WEAKNESS.

38:44.125 --> 38:46.417
BUT I JUST--I CAN'T FIND
THE INSPIRATION ANYMORE.

38:48.083 --> 38:50.959
IT'S EASY FOR YOU.
THE EVIDENCE OF YOUR TALENT
IS ALL AROUND YOU.

38:52.417 --> 38:54.625
THIS...
IS NOT MY TALENT.

38:54.625 --> 38:56.083
DAWSON, WHEN MY TIME
IS UP,

38:56.083 --> 39:00.291
I WANT TO KNOW THAT
I DID ONE THING WELL--

39:00.291 --> 39:01.917
LOVED SOMEBODY.

39:01.917 --> 39:04.458
THE REST OF THIS
IS JUST...

39:04.458 --> 39:07.667
AN EXPRESSION
OF THAT ONE THING.

39:09.000 --> 39:09.542
WHAT'S YOUR ONE THING?

39:11.667 --> 39:13.834
UH...[CHUCKLES]

39:13.834 --> 39:16.208
OK. CLOSE YOUR EYES.

39:17.333 --> 39:19.291
MM-HMM. NOW...

39:19.291 --> 39:20.667
PAINT YOUR FUTURE.

39:22.708 --> 39:24.000
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

39:44.708 --> 39:46.041
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO WORRY.

39:46.041 --> 39:48.041
I'M NOT GONNA
KISS YOU AGAIN,
JO.

39:52.333 --> 39:54.500
WHAT'S GOIN' ON
HERE?

39:56.542 --> 39:57.000
I DON'T KNOW.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.000
[CHUCKLES]

39:59.000 --> 40:01.708
DON'T YOU THINK
I DESERVE A BETTER
ANSWER THAN THAT

40:01.708 --> 40:02.625
AFTER ALL THIS?

40:02.625 --> 40:04.041
PACEY, BELIEVE ME,
I'VE BEEN TRYING

40:04.041 --> 40:06.792
TO GET YOU
OUT OF MY HEAD.
I'VE TRIED TO PRETEND

40:06.792 --> 40:09.083
THAT THIS IS JUST
SOME BIZARRE HORMONAL
GLITCH,

40:09.083 --> 40:10.375
BUT IT'S NOT WORKING.

40:10.375 --> 40:13.625
DO YOU REALLY
WANT IT TO WORK?

40:13.625 --> 40:15.000
I TRIED TO TELL HIM.

40:15.000 --> 40:17.000
REALLY.

40:17.000 --> 40:18.375
YES!

40:18.375 --> 40:19.750
WHAT HAPPENED?

40:19.750 --> 40:20.834
WELL--

40:23.125 --> 40:24.417
I COULDN'T REALLY
FIND THE WORDS,

40:24.417 --> 40:26.291
PACEY, WHICH
I KNOW IS ODD,

40:26.291 --> 40:28.250
CONSIDERING THE SHEER
VOLUME OF WORDS

40:28.250 --> 40:30.667
SPOKEN THROUGHOUT
THE COURSE OF OUR
RELATIONSHIP, BUT--

40:30.667 --> 40:32.542
WHAT WOULD  YOU
HAVE SAID TO HIM?

40:33.041 --> 40:35.333
[SIGHS]

40:37.792 --> 40:39.208
I DON'T KNOW.

40:41.375 --> 40:43.542
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

40:43.542 --> 40:45.917
PACEY...

40:45.917 --> 40:47.917
I DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS
RIGHT NOW,

40:47.917 --> 40:48.959
OK? CAN'T YOU
UNDERSTAND THAT?

40:48.959 --> 40:51.583
THE ONLY REASON THAT
YOU DON'T HAVE ANSWERS

40:51.583 --> 40:54.542
IS BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
TOO SCARED TO ASK YOURSELF
THE RIGHT QUESTIONS.

40:54.542 --> 40:56.000
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

40:56.000 --> 40:59.250
LOOK, I KNOW
HOW I FEEL. YOU  KNOW
HOW I FEEL.

40:59.250 --> 41:01.041
THAT MUCH IS OBVIOUS
BY NOW.

41:01.041 --> 41:01.917
BUT DURING
THIS WHOLE PROCESS,

41:01.917 --> 41:03.959
WE'VE MANAGED
TO MISS THE POINT,

41:03.959 --> 41:06.166
BECAUSE THE POINT
IS NOT HOW I FEEL.

41:06.166 --> 41:06.708
IT'S HOW YOU  FEEL.

41:08.417 --> 41:10.125
SO HOW DO YOU FEEL?

41:11.291 --> 41:11.583
AWFUL.

41:13.959 --> 41:16.333
THAT'S HOW I FEEL,
PACEY. I FEEL AWFUL.

41:16.333 --> 41:17.834
SO DO I.

41:20.333 --> 41:22.291
WHEN I WAS
KISSING YOU TONIGHT,

41:22.291 --> 41:25.333
I DON'T THINK
THAT I'VE EVER FELT
BETTER AND WORSE

41:25.333 --> 41:26.625
AT ONE TIME
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

41:26.625 --> 41:30.500
I MEAN, THE VERY IDEA
THAT DAWSON OR ANDIE

41:30.500 --> 41:32.291
WOULD FIND OUT ABOUT US
IS KILLING ME.

41:32.291 --> 41:36.792
IT--IT IS TEARING ME UP
ON THE INSIDE TO HAVE
THESE FEELINGS FOR YOU,

41:36.792 --> 41:38.542
BUT I CAN'T
GET RID OF THEM.

41:39.959 --> 41:43.750
[SIGHS] I JUS--
I CAN'T KEEP ON
KISSING YOU, JO.

41:43.750 --> 41:44.333
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

41:44.333 --> 41:46.583
I MEAN JUST THAT.

41:46.583 --> 41:48.500
I  CAN'T KEEP ON
KISSING YOU.

41:48.500 --> 41:50.542
ALL RIGHT?
I'VE DONE IT TWICE NOW.

41:50.542 --> 41:52.208
I CAN'T BE THE ONE
THAT'S ALWAYS
INITIATING THIS.

41:52.208 --> 41:55.000
I CAN'T BE THE ONE
WHO'S ALWAYS GIVING YOU
THE ANSWERS.

41:56.834 --> 41:57.792
[SNIFFLES]

41:57.792 --> 41:59.834

42:15.375 --> 42:18.417
OF WHAT I FEEL
FOR YOU...
