00:01.627 --> 00:05.380
Well, it's come to this, we're
drinking with our baby in a bar.

00:05.464 --> 00:06.673
It is not a bar.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.843
It's a restaurant that
happens to have a bar.

00:09.927 --> 00:12.012
Ergo, we are good parents.

00:12.012 --> 00:14.306
Unrelated: I'm getting
faced right now.

00:14.306 --> 00:15.516
Papa needs a grease coat.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.975
While it is
heartwarming to watch

00:17.059 --> 00:19.228
your firstborn teethe
on a jalapeÃ±o popper,

00:19.228 --> 00:20.812
wasn't Mickey
gonna watch him today?

00:20.896 --> 00:21.897
My dad's out all week.

00:21.897 --> 00:23.106
He's got the sniffles.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.775
For someone who's survived
numerous beatings

00:24.775 --> 00:26.276
from loan sharks, he has

00:26.360 --> 00:29.446
a surprisingly
delicate constitution.

00:29.530 --> 00:30.781
Well, my semester's over

00:30.781 --> 00:32.366
and the GNB building
is finally done.

00:32.366 --> 00:34.660
If you guys want,
I'm free to watch Marvin.

00:34.660 --> 00:36.828
I'm meeting with a headhunter
next week to line up

00:36.912 --> 00:39.122
my next project,
but until then, what the hell?

00:39.206 --> 00:42.000
Ted, although a "what
the hell" attitude is

00:42.084 --> 00:44.461
incredibly sought
after in a babysitter,

00:44.545 --> 00:45.963
I think that Lily
and Marshall...

00:45.963 --> 00:47.881
You're hired.

00:47.965 --> 00:49.758
Now that we've been
parents for awhile, we realize

00:49.842 --> 00:52.261
that pretty much any moron
can take care of a baby.

00:52.261 --> 00:54.972
Thank you.

00:54.972 --> 00:56.723
Mine!

00:56.807 --> 00:58.851
- Ow.
- Delicious and mine.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.188
They do look yummy
yum-yum, mister.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.570
No. No!

01:09.570 --> 01:10.988
What have I done?

01:10.988 --> 01:13.115
I am so sorry, Cornelius.

01:13.115 --> 01:16.451
You deserve
a better end than this!

01:16.535 --> 01:18.203
You got ketchup
on a red tie.

01:18.287 --> 01:19.788
You can't even see it.

01:25.377 --> 01:26.461
Clear!

01:27.546 --> 01:29.381
I'm going in.

01:33.302 --> 01:34.845
Oh, my...

01:34.845 --> 01:36.722
damn it, guys,
we lost him.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.849
And he was so close
to retirement.

01:38.849 --> 01:40.851
Just this morning
he said to me,

01:40.851 --> 01:42.811
"I'm getting too old
for this shirt."

01:44.730 --> 01:47.733
I know, dude.

01:55.199 --> 01:56.783
Oh, my God.

01:56.867 --> 02:00.037
You are such
a good folder.

02:00.037 --> 02:01.914
That's, like, The Gap good.

02:04.166 --> 02:05.834
Robin...

02:07.711 --> 02:09.505
let's go hit the bar.

02:09.505 --> 02:10.714
At this restaurant.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.549
I think they have a bar here.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.639
- Okay, what was that?
- What was what?

02:18.639 --> 02:21.225
The "dumb cheerleader flirting
with the quarterback" thing.

02:21.225 --> 02:22.351
You looked like
you were gonna

02:22.351 --> 02:25.437
chase Barney down with a sixer
of watermelon wine coolers.

02:25.521 --> 02:28.148
Okay. First of all, those bad girls
come in fourskis.

02:28.232 --> 02:31.527
And second, why would I
be flirting with Barney?

02:31.527 --> 02:35.405
I'm not interested in him,
and I made that very clear.

02:35.489 --> 02:37.824
With something that I did.

02:37.908 --> 02:39.952
- Recently.
- Just spill it.

02:39.952 --> 02:42.538
<i>The other week,
Barney made a move,</i>

02:42.538 --> 02:44.581
<i>but I turned him down.</i>

02:44.665 --> 02:46.667
<i>I felt awful for closing
the door in his face,</i>

02:46.667 --> 02:48.544
<i>but he realized I was right.</i>

02:48.544 --> 02:50.712
I'm done trying to get you.

02:50.796 --> 02:51.922
I can't do it anymore.

02:51.922 --> 02:54.091
- And now I get it.
- Get what?

02:54.091 --> 02:57.177
You may have closed the door
on Barney, but he locked it.

02:57.261 --> 02:58.470
What? No, he didn't.

02:58.554 --> 02:59.721
Yeah, he got the last word,

02:59.805 --> 03:00.848
and now you want

03:00.848 --> 03:02.850
what you can't have,
like you always do.

03:02.850 --> 03:05.561
It's the classic
lobster situation.

03:05.561 --> 03:07.729
I'm afraid
you're allergic to lobster.

03:07.813 --> 03:11.483
You can never, ever, ever
have it.

03:18.115 --> 03:22.119
Oh, this... is... delicious.

03:22.119 --> 03:24.329
Once you learned
you couldn't have lobster,

03:24.413 --> 03:25.956
you became obsessed.

03:25.956 --> 03:27.165
Barney's the same thing.

03:27.249 --> 03:29.042
And this is gonna
blow up in your face,

03:29.126 --> 03:31.420
just like the lobster
blew up your face.

03:31.420 --> 03:33.881
Wrong.
This is nothing like lobster.

03:33.881 --> 03:37.092
Okay. Just remember, you can never
hook up with Barney again.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.427
- That's fine.
- Never.

03:38.427 --> 03:44.016
Ever, ever, ever, ever.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.198
Oh, no.

03:59.198 --> 04:01.074
Marshall, Lily and
Ted can't make it,

04:01.158 --> 04:02.826
for viable reasons
I just learned

04:02.910 --> 04:05.746
via this text message
I accidentally deleted.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.915
Guess it's just gonna be
you and me.

04:07.915 --> 04:10.918
- Fine by me.
- Me, too. Totally.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.336
Supafine.

04:13.921 --> 04:15.881
<i>Hey there, Scherbats,
your voice of reason here.</i>

04:15.881 --> 04:17.299
What you doing?

04:17.299 --> 04:18.383
I hope you don't mind,

04:18.467 --> 04:20.761
but I was hungry, so I ordered
MacLaren's new special.

04:20.761 --> 04:24.181
I couldn't eat lunch at work
because they ordered...

04:24.181 --> 04:25.390
Thai food.

04:25.474 --> 04:27.768
I miss you, Cornelius!

04:27.768 --> 04:29.645
Oh, my God.

04:29.645 --> 04:31.605
You're so sensitive.

04:31.605 --> 04:33.148
And deep.

04:33.232 --> 04:35.067
<i>No. You're better than this.</i>

04:35.067 --> 04:37.945
<i>Barney is not like lobster.</i>

04:37.945 --> 04:40.113
<i>Okay, that's unfortunate,
but it doesn't mean</i>

04:40.197 --> 04:41.740
<i>you have to hook up
with Barney.</i>

04:41.740 --> 04:42.824
Whoa!

04:42.908 --> 04:44.034
<i>God, you said that out loud!</i>

04:44.034 --> 04:45.118
<i>No, I didn't.</i>

04:45.202 --> 04:46.662
<i>How would you know?
You're out of control.</i>

04:46.662 --> 04:49.957
<i>Oh, you think you're so smart,
don't you, bitch?</i>

04:49.957 --> 04:53.168
Um, billion-dollar idea alert.

04:53.252 --> 04:55.712
Why should bibs
only be socially acceptable

04:55.796 --> 04:56.839
when you're eating lobster?

04:56.839 --> 04:58.423
If we could wear them
all the time,

04:58.507 --> 04:59.716
then Corny would still be

04:59.800 --> 05:01.885
with us right now.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.220
I miss...

05:05.097 --> 05:07.808
picture a bib
that looks like your suit:

05:07.808 --> 05:10.602
- a collar, a tie, a jacket.
- Mm-hmm.

05:10.686 --> 05:12.980
<i>Atta girl. Keep it cool.</i>

05:12.980 --> 05:15.899
I could call them Brobibs!

05:15.983 --> 05:17.234
That's interesting.

05:17.234 --> 05:19.319
<i>Yeah, you got this.</i>

05:19.403 --> 05:21.822
<i>I'm sorry I called you a bitch.</i>

05:21.822 --> 05:22.906
What do you think?

05:22.990 --> 05:25.659
Oh, that idea's amazeballs!

05:26.827 --> 05:27.870
<i>That's it. I'm out of here.</i>

05:32.374 --> 05:33.709
I'm out of control.

05:33.709 --> 05:36.128
I came this close to telling Barney
that I wanted him.

05:36.128 --> 05:39.173
Robin, as your friend,
I got to be honest.

05:39.173 --> 05:42.426
I think this Brobibs thing
is a frickin' gold mine.

05:42.426 --> 05:45.220
What? No.
Lily, I really need advice.

05:45.304 --> 05:47.014
Okay. Invest now.

05:47.014 --> 05:50.434
Seriously, it's like Apple
at ten dollars a share.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.603
- Lily, please.
- Okay, I'm sorry.

05:52.603 --> 05:54.605
I'm just, I'm a little distracted.

05:54.605 --> 05:56.023
I-I got to get upstairs

05:56.023 --> 05:57.941
and check on
Ted and Marvin.

05:58.025 --> 06:01.653
Can we please just talk about
this Brobib thing another time?

06:05.073 --> 06:06.116
How was your day?

06:06.200 --> 06:07.951
Good, although I think
I just saw a woman

06:08.035 --> 06:09.786
with a full beard outside.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.079
Marvin crawled!

06:11.163 --> 06:13.457
What? He's never done that before.

06:13.457 --> 06:14.791
I know!

06:14.875 --> 06:17.920
I think I just saw a guy
with breasts outside.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.505
Marvin crawled.

06:19.505 --> 06:21.131
- I can't believe it.
- Believe it.

06:21.215 --> 06:22.341
I took a video for you.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.968
<i>You're doing it, Marvin.</i>

06:25.052 --> 06:27.179
Go, go, go, go, go.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.347
<i>Oh!</i>

06:28.347 --> 06:31.266
Your Uncle Ted is so proud.

06:31.350 --> 06:32.351
Whoops.

06:32.351 --> 06:34.770
Guess I had the camera flipped.

06:34.770 --> 06:36.980
I use it to check my teeth for debris.

06:39.024 --> 06:42.486
Ooh, sounds like
somebody's "crawling" me.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.824
Oh, sweetie, oh, come on.

06:47.908 --> 06:50.827
Lil, listen, so we missed
the first time he crawled.

06:50.911 --> 06:51.954
So what?

06:51.954 --> 06:54.248
We'll see it the
next time, I promise.

06:54.248 --> 06:55.832
Oh, my God,
he just did it again!

07:02.673 --> 07:04.716
Guys, get in here!
Marvin can't stop crawling!

07:04.800 --> 07:06.760
He's Holden Crawl-field!

07:06.844 --> 07:09.805
Get in here right now...
nope, nope, it's over.

07:12.850 --> 07:14.768
Okay, hey, I know. Baby, I know, I know.

07:14.852 --> 07:18.397
But, listen, there will be
plenty of other Marvin firsts.

07:18.397 --> 07:19.481
His first day at school,

07:19.565 --> 07:21.608
his first trip to meet Santa,

07:21.692 --> 07:23.110
his first
touchdown pass for

07:23.110 --> 07:26.196
the 2032 Super Bowl champion
Vikings... no pressure.

07:26.280 --> 07:28.490
I'll love him even if he runs
the ball into the end zone.

07:28.574 --> 07:31.201
So can we please just let
this crawling thing go?

07:31.285 --> 07:32.744
Yeah, okay. You're right.

07:32.828 --> 07:34.663
I mean, I'm being nuts.

07:34.663 --> 07:37.499
- We'll see it when we see it.
- Yeah.

07:37.583 --> 07:39.042
Do it.

07:39.126 --> 07:40.836
If you ever want to
see these boobs again,

07:40.836 --> 07:43.046
crawl, you son of a me.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.673
Come on, Lil.

07:44.673 --> 07:48.594
You know what they say:
a watched tot never crawls.

07:50.554 --> 07:52.222
Or calls you later in life,

07:52.306 --> 07:55.142
after it sees
this disturbing footage.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.518
Hey, Lily, Marshall.

07:56.602 --> 07:58.854
Uh, Lily, we need to talk.

07:58.854 --> 08:00.564
Oh, that sounds serious!

08:00.564 --> 08:02.065
Oh, you guys should
talk about it

08:02.149 --> 08:03.901
down at the bar
until after Marvin's asleep.

08:03.901 --> 08:05.110
And if you want to
stay down there until

08:05.194 --> 08:06.862
after SportsCenter's over,
that's fine, too.

08:06.862 --> 08:08.405
Ooh.

08:10.115 --> 08:12.492
Keep shooting.
If you miss it, I'm leaving you.

08:19.291 --> 08:22.044
Yeah, that seems
about right.

08:22.044 --> 08:23.670
Sorry if I'm bad company.

08:23.754 --> 08:24.963
I'm not sure anything is gonna

08:25.047 --> 08:28.342
take my mind off of missing
Marvin's first crawl.

08:28.342 --> 08:30.761
Lily, I've had a revelation.

08:30.761 --> 08:32.304
Brobibs for women.

08:32.304 --> 08:33.514
Bitchbibs!

08:33.514 --> 08:34.723
You know Barney's gonna sue us,

08:34.723 --> 08:36.099
but damn it,
let's just go for it.

08:36.183 --> 08:37.684
No, Lily, this is serious.

08:37.768 --> 08:39.937
When that doctor told me
I couldn't eat lobster

08:39.937 --> 08:42.481
and I did it anyway,
it almost killed me.

08:42.481 --> 08:43.732
But here's the thing:

08:43.732 --> 08:45.901
I never wanted lobster again.

08:45.901 --> 08:47.694
So the solution is obvious.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.780
The only way to get
Barney out of my system

08:49.780 --> 08:54.243
is to get him into my system,
one last time.

08:54.243 --> 08:55.452
It's brilliant, right?

08:55.536 --> 08:56.703
Not brilliant at all.

08:56.787 --> 08:58.664
- Thanks for being on board.
- Not on board.

08:58.664 --> 09:00.207
- It means a lot.
- Big mistake.

09:00.207 --> 09:02.084
You're my girl.

09:02.084 --> 09:06.213
Now it's just a question
of how to get him...

09:08.841 --> 09:10.801
Hey, Robin,
I just got your text.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.010
What's the big emergency?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.095
Hi, Barney!

09:13.095 --> 09:14.429
You seem like you run fast.

09:14.513 --> 09:16.098
Do you want me to fan you
with my US magazine?

09:16.098 --> 09:18.267
He's fine.
- Thanks, Patrice.

09:20.102 --> 09:22.229
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

09:22.229 --> 09:23.564
I just got this
new printer,

09:23.564 --> 09:25.482
and I need somebody
big and strong

09:25.566 --> 09:27.234
to take it to my office for me.

09:27.234 --> 09:29.528
I promise to repay you.

09:29.528 --> 09:31.530
We'll do it
for you, Robin!

09:31.530 --> 09:34.575
Don't you have a late-breaking
weather story to cover, Brandi?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.410
Oh, I did it already.

09:36.410 --> 09:37.744
It rained.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.329
Oh, I got to jump on

09:39.413 --> 09:41.290
a big Brobibs
conference call.

09:41.290 --> 09:45.460
The lawyer from Dude Aprons
is really busting my balls.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.129
See ya.

09:47.129 --> 09:50.549
Nobody asked
for your help, Patrice!

09:50.549 --> 09:52.342
You either, Brandi!

09:56.221 --> 09:57.681
Stop it.

09:57.681 --> 09:58.765
Hey, hey.

09:58.849 --> 10:01.476
What are you guys doing
slobbering all over my friend?

10:01.560 --> 10:03.729
Oh, Barney, don't be jealous.

10:03.729 --> 10:07.232
If you're gonna drool,
do it in style!

10:07.316 --> 10:10.569
Just go to Brobibs.com.

10:10.569 --> 10:13.071
We've got every look
in the book.

10:13.155 --> 10:14.948
The Business Casual.

10:16.617 --> 10:17.993
The Preppy.

10:19.828 --> 10:21.872
The Robin Williams.

10:25.918 --> 10:27.044
Bib up!

10:27.044 --> 10:28.253
Brobibs is in no way
affiliated with,

10:28.337 --> 10:30.547

Dude Aprons.

10:36.011 --> 10:38.138
Hey, there.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.556
Hey!

10:39.640 --> 10:43.393
It is so good to see you.

10:44.895 --> 10:45.896
Thanks, Robin.

10:45.896 --> 10:48.941
This game affects my
league score.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.737
Look, I don't agree
with your lobster quest,

10:53.737 --> 10:56.907
but I can't stand watching you
make a fool of yourself.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.201
You want the fix?
I got the fix.

10:59.201 --> 11:00.869
Back in college...

11:00.953 --> 11:03.747
<i>it was love at first sight
for me and Marshall,</i>

11:03.747 --> 11:06.834
<i>but when it came to making
the first move, well,</i>

11:06.834 --> 11:08.710
<i>he needed help.</i>

11:08.794 --> 11:11.213
<i>So I took matters
into my own hands.</i>

11:15.384 --> 11:16.677
Let's get out of here.

11:19.263 --> 11:21.431
You just need a girl
who, I don't know,

11:21.515 --> 11:24.017
gets a few drinks in her
and wants to have fun

11:24.101 --> 11:26.228
- and put on a show.
- Mm-hmm.

11:26.228 --> 11:28.355
And it drives guys crazy,
'cause you both

11:28.355 --> 11:29.565
don't even care.

11:29.565 --> 11:32.025
It's just stupid and fun.

11:32.109 --> 11:35.070
Lily, that sounds perfect.
Thank you.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.865
Mm. Just stupid.

11:37.865 --> 11:39.783
Stupid and fun.

11:47.165 --> 11:48.375
Who the hell is that?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.002
Hey, guys.

11:50.002 --> 11:53.046
Barney, this is Brandi,
my fun friend from work,

11:53.130 --> 11:55.340
who just doesn't even care.

11:55.424 --> 11:57.050
Hello, Brandi.

11:57.134 --> 11:59.219
Congratulations on the gig.

11:59.303 --> 12:00.304
Aw, thank you!

12:00.304 --> 12:02.514
World Wide News is
an amazing place to work.

12:02.598 --> 12:05.601
Not that gig, sweetheart.

12:11.440 --> 12:13.358
Marshall!

12:13.442 --> 12:16.111
What? Ow.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.487
It's late.

12:17.571 --> 12:19.281
I'm so tipsy.

12:20.449 --> 12:22.868
It is late.
We should get out of here.

12:25.704 --> 12:29.041
So, Brandi, ever sneak
into the studio

12:29.041 --> 12:31.043
and do it in front of
the weather map?

12:31.043 --> 12:32.794
No. Why do you ask?

12:32.878 --> 12:34.838
No reason.

12:35.923 --> 12:39.218
Someone is about to get
unseasonably banged.

12:41.720 --> 12:43.388
Damn it!

12:43.472 --> 12:44.848
What did I do wrong?

12:44.932 --> 12:47.559
- Nothing. It was awesome.
- Oh, Marshall, let's go!

12:51.605 --> 12:54.024
- Hey.
- Hey, Lilypad!

12:54.024 --> 12:55.526
So, don't be upset.

12:55.526 --> 12:58.529
Ted... took Marvin shopping

12:58.529 --> 13:01.365
and sort of bought him...

13:01.365 --> 13:03.242
all his winter clothes.

13:03.242 --> 13:04.993
Get ready

13:05.077 --> 13:06.662
for our star runway model...

13:06.662 --> 13:09.623
or should I say, our star
crawlway model.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.250
He's doing it again, guys!
Get in here!

13:11.250 --> 13:13.460
N-No-no, it's over.

13:13.544 --> 13:15.420
That's it. Ted's fired.

13:15.504 --> 13:18.549
Fired? No, c-come on, Lily,
he's helping us out.

13:18.549 --> 13:20.259
Plus, next week,
your dad'll be back,

13:20.259 --> 13:22.219
and Ted has the meeting
with that headhunter.

13:22.219 --> 13:24.012
Let's just stay cool.

13:24.096 --> 13:25.597
Starting at quarterback,

13:25.681 --> 13:28.225
the pride of Cleveland...

13:28.225 --> 13:31.436
Marvin Eriksen!
Right?

13:31.520 --> 13:34.147
Right, guys? He's gonna be
a little Browns fan.

13:35.941 --> 13:38.527
Oh, by the way, I cancelled that
meeting with the headhunter,

13:38.527 --> 13:40.445
so I can take care
of Marvin next week.

13:40.529 --> 13:42.698
What? No, no, my dad'll
be better by then.

13:42.698 --> 13:44.241
Oh, I gave Mickey the month off.

13:44.241 --> 13:46.827
It's supposed to snow, and, uh,
Uncle Ted doesn't want to miss

13:46.827 --> 13:48.871
Marvin's first sleigh ride.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.247
- You're fired.
- You're fired.

13:57.254 --> 14:00.799
Marvin has a bib with little...
little dinosaurs on it.

14:00.883 --> 14:02.217
Maybe you should
make one like that.

14:02.301 --> 14:04.887
Brobibs are for grown men
wearing bibs, Ted.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.638
I don't want them
looking like idiots.

14:09.391 --> 14:12.019
Lily, Marshall, you know you
can't keep him away from me.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.478
He's gonna start
asking questions.

14:13.562 --> 14:14.730
Calm down, Ted.

14:14.730 --> 14:16.190
We-we just wanted
to apologize.

14:16.190 --> 14:17.691
We overreacted before.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.318
Mm-hmm.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.402
<i>Meet us</i>

14:20.402 --> 14:23.197
at the swim class you apparently
signed Marvin up for.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.741
Bubble Buddies?
I'd love t...

14:25.741 --> 14:28.202
I mean, I'll have
to check my skedge.

14:28.202 --> 14:29.286
Sorry. When I'm excited,

14:29.286 --> 14:30.662
I abbreviate words I shouldn't.

14:30.746 --> 14:31.788
<i>Come on, Ted,</i>

14:31.872 --> 14:32.956
what do you say?

14:33.040 --> 14:34.333
Fab. Perf.

14:34.333 --> 14:36.543
Sorry. See you at B-Buds.

14:36.627 --> 14:39.046
Bubble Buddies. Sorry.

14:41.548 --> 14:43.717
Augie. Jayden.

14:43.717 --> 14:46.345
Dylan. Girl Dylan.

14:46.345 --> 14:48.555
Hey, Ted.
- Hey. Where's Marvin?

14:48.639 --> 14:51.391
Does Coach Amber have him
warming up in the Jacooz?

14:51.475 --> 14:52.518
Sorry again.

14:52.518 --> 14:55.979
Aw, hey, buddy, listen,
we wanted to talk to you

14:56.063 --> 14:58.982
about how you've kind of been
overdoing it with Marvin.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.526
I haven't been overdoing it.

15:00.526 --> 15:02.736
Ted, we're in
a baby swim class,

15:02.736 --> 15:04.780
and clearly you've
done something extreme

15:04.780 --> 15:07.407
to get the naming rights
to that lollipop bin.

15:09.243 --> 15:10.410
But I-I think that we've

15:10.494 --> 15:11.870
figured out what's
going on with you.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.664
See, after we let you go...

15:13.664 --> 15:15.624
What is this?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.501
Marvin's Book of Firsts?

15:29.263 --> 15:31.640
Ted... Ted took Marvin
to see Santa?

15:31.640 --> 15:33.475
Oh, I am gonna
take this book

15:33.559 --> 15:35.602
and I'm gonna shove it
so far up his...

15:35.686 --> 15:37.437
The point is,
it made us remember

15:37.521 --> 15:39.064
another scrapbook you made.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.785
That project really
was your baby,

15:51.869 --> 15:55.330
and now it's over, and
you're scared to move on.

15:55.414 --> 15:58.667
I poured my blood, sweat
and tears into that building.

15:58.667 --> 16:00.419
Though, to be fair,
a lot of that happened

16:00.419 --> 16:02.629
the day I accidentally fell
down the elevator shaft.

16:02.713 --> 16:03.714
Mm.

16:03.714 --> 16:05.883
The point is,
it's just really hard to let go.

16:05.883 --> 16:09.136
Especially when that building's
my biggest accomplishment.

16:09.136 --> 16:12.055
I mean, maybe if I was where
you guys are at in life,

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
with all you have
to be proud of...

16:17.644 --> 16:19.104
We get it, okay?

16:19.188 --> 16:21.481
You're always gonna be
Uncle Ted.

16:22.900 --> 16:24.860
But if Marvin
can't be your next project,

16:24.860 --> 16:26.612
you need one of your own,

16:26.612 --> 16:29.781
and so we rescheduled
your meeting with that headhunter.

16:29.865 --> 16:31.283
He's over there.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.703
Which one is he?

16:36.622 --> 16:38.165
Thanks, guys.

16:38.165 --> 16:39.917
Marvin and I are lucky
you're our parents.

16:39.917 --> 16:41.919
Aw.

16:41.919 --> 16:43.337
Oh, hey, Ted?

16:43.337 --> 16:44.796
It's kind of a big,
professional meeting,

16:44.880 --> 16:46.673
you might want to trade out
that lollipop

16:46.757 --> 16:48.967
- for a shirt.
- Yeah.

16:49.051 --> 16:51.803
- I'll just give it to one of these kids.
- Oh, buddy.

16:51.887 --> 16:53.138
- What?
- You're half naked,

16:53.222 --> 16:56.183
you're not a parent to
any of these children,

16:56.183 --> 16:58.644
don't offer 'em candy.

16:58.644 --> 17:01.522
I can't believe Barney
went home with Brandi.

17:01.522 --> 17:03.941
I should have asked you
to do that play with me.

17:03.941 --> 17:06.401
Well, it's too late now,
isn't it?

17:06.485 --> 17:07.861
There he is. Straddle me.
Start grinding.

17:07.945 --> 17:10.614
Nothing's off-limits.

17:10.614 --> 17:12.574
So, last night

17:12.658 --> 17:14.993
Brandi and I got
to the WWN studios,

17:15.077 --> 17:17.204
and my high-pressure system

17:17.204 --> 17:20.040
was ready to slam
into her warm front.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.834
The studio's unlocked,

17:21.834 --> 17:22.918
the weather map's up,

17:22.918 --> 17:25.170
ready to do it in 17
different states at once?

17:26.630 --> 17:29.216
Um, actually...

17:29.216 --> 17:31.009
I don't think I want that.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.847
I'm sorry. I'm-I'm...

17:34.847 --> 17:37.432
I'm gonna go.

17:37.516 --> 17:39.601
Wait, you didn't
sleep with her?

17:39.685 --> 17:40.686
Nope.

17:40.686 --> 17:42.271
I spent the night
thinking about

17:42.271 --> 17:45.649
how everything I've done
since Quinn and I broke up

17:45.649 --> 17:48.068
has been a cry for help.

17:48.068 --> 17:49.987
Dressing a dog up like me,

17:49.987 --> 17:51.363
hooking up with
all those nannies...

17:51.363 --> 17:53.490
- Brobibs?
- No, those are solid.

17:53.574 --> 17:54.575
I still want in.

17:54.575 --> 17:58.161
And I realized that...
I'm searching,

17:58.245 --> 18:00.873
searching for what
I really want in life,

18:00.873 --> 18:02.040
and you know what?

18:02.124 --> 18:05.878
I have absolutely
no idea what that is.

18:05.878 --> 18:08.672
Wow.

18:08.672 --> 18:10.424
- Barney...
- But...

18:10.424 --> 18:12.926
I'm going to figure it out.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.386
I have to.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.346
Good night, guys.

18:19.516 --> 18:21.643
God, I feel awful.

18:21.727 --> 18:23.562
Barney is going through something big,

18:23.562 --> 18:27.065
and I've been obsessing
about one stupid final hookup

18:27.149 --> 18:29.401
to get him out of my system.

18:29.401 --> 18:31.695
He needs space...

18:31.695 --> 18:33.947
and time to figure things out.

18:35.073 --> 18:36.158
And I have to give it to him.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.913
- Robin? What are you doing here?
- It's okay

18:40.913 --> 18:43.290
if you don't know
what you want in life...

18:44.374 --> 18:46.710
as long as you know
what you want...

18:48.295 --> 18:51.131
tonight.

18:51.215 --> 18:53.967
Well...

18:54.051 --> 18:55.552
I do know what I want.

18:58.347 --> 18:59.640
Hi, Robin!

18:59.640 --> 19:02.851
Nobody asked you
here, Patrice!

19:04.937 --> 19:07.105
Actually, I did.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.190
Last night.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.359
Let me go see if
the studio's open.

19:10.359 --> 19:11.860
All right.

19:15.948 --> 19:17.324
Oh, hi, Barney.

19:17.324 --> 19:19.159
I'm working late.

19:19.243 --> 19:20.452
What are you doing here?

19:20.536 --> 19:23.080
I'm...

19:24.498 --> 19:26.708
I don't know what
I'm doing... here.

19:28.126 --> 19:30.671
Barney, I don't know
you that well, but...

19:30.671 --> 19:32.422
are you okay?

19:32.506 --> 19:34.675
Yeah. What do you mean?

19:34.675 --> 19:36.677
Well, whenever I see
someone unhappy,

19:36.677 --> 19:37.970
I get the urge to give them cookies,

19:37.970 --> 19:40.389
and I really want
to give you cookies right now.

19:42.808 --> 19:43.934
Cookie?

19:43.934 --> 19:46.687
You're lame. No, thanks.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.981
You sure?
They're heart-shaped.

19:48.981 --> 19:50.899
Sorry, a couple
of them are broken.

19:50.983 --> 19:53.360
I know how they feel.
I'd love one.

19:54.403 --> 19:56.446
After that,
I sent Brandi packing,

19:56.530 --> 19:58.615
and Patrice and I
talked all night.

19:58.699 --> 19:59.783
We're...

19:59.867 --> 20:02.744
kind of on a date right now.

20:02.828 --> 20:04.872
But if you'd like
to throw on some clothes

20:04.872 --> 20:06.373
and join us for Crazy Eights...

20:06.373 --> 20:07.875
I can deal you in!

20:07.875 --> 20:09.710
My deck has puppies on it!

20:09.710 --> 20:10.961
Arf-arf!

20:13.589 --> 20:14.715
Um...

20:17.384 --> 20:19.136
I... got to go.

20:24.975 --> 20:27.269
Look, I still feel bad
I went too far

20:27.269 --> 20:30.689
with all the Marvin firsts,
the Santa thing, especially.

20:30.689 --> 20:32.274
I mean,
I should've known.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.775
