She had opportunity, and
a ghost to pin it on.

murder Sister Fabian?

12:07.440 --> 12:09.720
Because Sister Fabian murdered her.

to this miserable place.

12:19.560 --> 12:22.399

When You Were Sweet Sixteen.

12:22.400 --> 12:27.679
When she played it, it made us... happy.

All the girls loved her, which is
exactly why Sister Fabian hated her.

12:31.840 --> 12:35.080
- And when they took her baby away -
- Lucy had a child?

12:35.600 --> 12:37.359

12:37.360 --> 12:43.119
Without her, Lucy was a different
person, angry, sad. No more piano.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.719
And when she talked back, Sister
Fabian took a razor

12:45.720 --> 12:48.240
and chopped off her beautiful red hair.

12:48.480 --> 12:51.559
But that wasn't enough.

doing with the children.

Oh, he is in the darkness.

Hm.

17:13.464 --> 17:15.464
Did the medium tell you anything else

17:15.464 --> 17:17.984
that would make you
think she's credible?

17:19.825 --> 17:21.984
She impressed me.

17:22.744 --> 17:24.905
Look at this.

17:29.065 --> 17:30.784
Darlin', give us a kiss, right?

17:30.785 --> 17:32.985
He's definitely sooty enough.

17:35.905 --> 17:38.065
And he's definitely flush.

17:40.145 --> 17:44.104
I have an idea. If he has something
to hide, I imagine he'll run.

17:44.105 --> 17:46.264
And if he doesn't?

17:46.265 --> 17:48.545
I imagine he'll beat me rather badly.

17:52.865 --> 17:55.025
Excuse me.

18:00.305 --> 18:02.785
Do your friends know
you stole this money?

18:12.145 --> 18:14.305
Hey!

18:15.545 --> 18:17.705
- Urgh!
- Ooh!

18:22.225 --> 18:24.385
Well played, Constable.

18:25.025 --> 18:27.504
- Has he confessed?
- It's only a matter of time.

Sergeant Gudgett is quite effective
in his interrogation techniques.

18:31.105 --> 18:33.464
And he was drinking? So human, right?

18:33.465 --> 18:36.464
Yes. I've lost the battle.
But I've won the war.

18:36.465 --> 18:40.105
We were only able to catch our man
with the help of a medium.

18:41.705 --> 18:44.504
Then he isn't your man -
garbage in, garbage out.

18:44.505 --> 18:46.304
He had a small fortune in his pocket.

18:46.305 --> 18:49.224
You think he'd got a pay rise?
So he was carrying stolen money.

18:49.225 --> 18:51.264
So are most of the men in Whitechapel.

- A hundred bucks?
- You do know each country
has its own currency?

19:03.305 --> 19:06.384
Why rob a nunnery unless you know
there's money there?

19:06.385 --> 19:10.625
I figure it's an inside job, so I
revisited the Sisters' record book.

19:11.185 --> 19:13.384
Most of her entries are deadly boring,

19:13.385 --> 19:16.464

19:18.105 --> 19:21.225
someone who had access to the books
and the lock-box.

So you're accusing Sister Mathilda,

she joined the Sisters.

that's a skill acquired in prison.

built on the site of a distillery

27:14.854 --> 27:17.853

secret passageways,

27:17.854 --> 27:20.693
but this one runs from
Sister Fabian's office,

27:20.694 --> 27:23.494
right up to the courtyard
where Lucy is buried.

27:24.854 --> 27:27.533
You see? There's a direct
path from Lucy's grave

27:27.534 --> 27:29.893
to Fabian's office, where
the killer passed.

27:29.894 --> 27:31.813
It makes no sense for a living killer

27:31.814 --> 27:35.934
to run for a sealed passageway.
But Lucy? This was her escape route.

If a ghost can pass through the wall,
why does it need a passageway at all?

27:47.734 --> 27:49.573
And on the subway, does it pay

27:49.574 --> 27:51.933
or does it just drift
through the turnstile?

31:43.924 --> 31:46.244
Just promise you'll keep coming back.

31:46.644 --> 31:48.804
Yes, of course.

31:49.924 --> 31:52.604
Oh, it's wonderful to
hear your voice again.

31:53.524 --> 31:57.563
Since I died, I've been
so terribly lonely.

31:57.564 --> 31:59.563
Since you died?

31:59.564 --> 32:02.764
Darling, I know it's difficult to
hear but, but you...

32:39.724 --> 32:41.884
My dear Touie.

33:19.564 --> 33:21.884
Hello? Hello?

33:24.404 --> 33:28.763
That Italian man who says he can
send a message across the sea,

33:28.764 --> 33:31.123
how's he expect to do it without a wire?

33:31.124 --> 33:33.764
Marconi. Most people think he can't.

33:34.884 --> 33:37.203
- What do you think?
- I don't know,

33:37.204 --> 33:39.724
but I think it would be
brilliant if he could.

33:42.004 --> 33:44.164
Were you able to talk to mother?

33:46.204 --> 33:48.364
- I'll keep trying.
- You'd better.

33:51.444 --> 33:53.604
You're so like her.

33:57.364 --> 33:59.724
I'll be back in time to say good night.

34:03.324 --> 34:05.683
- I had an epiphany.
- You know who the murderer is?

34:05.684 --> 34:08.844
No, but I know how -- Then my epiphany
trumps yours. Come on.

34:10.123 --> 34:13.402
We should've taken my car,
it can do 14 miles per hour.

34:13.404 --> 34:16.163
My Oldsmobile does 15 but trust me,
this'll be faster,

34:16.164 --> 34:18.322
we'll be there in less than six minutes.

34:18.324 --> 34:20.003
You couldn't know that.

34:20.004 --> 34:22.204
Hundred bucks says I do.

34:24.964 --> 34:27.803
Sergeant, I need to speak to
Sister Grace immediately.

34:27.804 --> 34:30.003
All you need is to know
she's safe and sound.

34:30.004 --> 34:34.203
- I think I know who the killer is.
- You pop over to Baker Street?
Sherlock Holmes?

34:34.204 --> 34:36.404
Argh!

34:37.964 --> 34:39.483
- Damn!
- That was necessary,

34:39.484 --> 34:41.804
time being of the essence and all that.

34:43.083 --> 34:46.643
Ah, I was just coming to see you.
Now, I noticed you had a limp.

34:47.204 --> 34:49.524
- Doyle!
- She has Ehler-Danlos Syndrome,

34:50.324 --> 34:53.884
characterized by hyper-flexible
joints and a slight limp.

34:54.764 --> 34:57.803
And it's hereditary. One might
expect that if Sister Grace

34:57.804 --> 35:03.044
were to have a child, they may be
double-jointed, or even red-headed.

35:09.724 --> 35:11.884
Lucy was your daughter.

35:12.324 --> 35:15.244
And the killings, a mother's revenge.

35:16.604 --> 35:18.764
Not revenge...

35:19.084 --> 35:20.763
a mother's love.

35:20.764 --> 35:22.964
You were a Maggie, too.

35:23.444 --> 35:26.884
- How could you?
- It destroyed me
when they took my baby away.

35:28.164 --> 35:30.644
But I had committed a mortal sin.

35:31.284 --> 35:33.443
I tried to put it behind me.

35:33.444 --> 35:36.484
I changed my name, and came here
to start a new life.

35:38.204 --> 35:43.324
But when my daughter showed up...
with a child of her own...

35:48.164 --> 35:50.244
I wanted to rush to her, to hold her.

35:51.604 --> 35:58.724
But I was a nun, I could never admit
to being a 'fallen woman'.

35:59.524 --> 36:02.204
I asked God why He'd sent her to me.

36:03.164 --> 36:05.844
But when they started to torture her
I understood.

36:09.284 --> 36:10.483
(WHIMPERS)

36:10.484 --> 36:14.404
Watching her die was my penance for
the sin I thought I could escape.

36:20.244 --> 36:21.694
I had to let them take her.

36:24.764 --> 36:26.924
(SOBS)

36:27.524 --> 36:30.644
I had to sacrifice my
only begotten child.

36:34.444 --> 36:41.083
I had failed Lucy in life but when
the girls started seeing her,

36:41.084 --> 36:42.763
I knew she was a tormented spirit

36:42.764 --> 36:45.203
and I vowed I couldn't
fail her in death.

36:45.204 --> 36:47.763
I had to take the lives
of those responsible,

36:47.764 --> 36:49.964
not to avenge Lucy...

36:51.444 --> 36:53.604
but to give her peace.

36:53.964 --> 36:57.083
You left that message on the window
to take the suspicion off you,

36:57.084 --> 36:59.644
make us think that you
were the third victim.

37:00.204 --> 37:02.324
No, I don't think it's
as simple as that.

37:03.524 --> 37:06.284
Sister, please. Sister,
this is pointless.

37:07.884 --> 37:09.844
Really? You're gonna out-limp us?

37:23.004 --> 37:25.164
There she is. Sister!

37:31.444 --> 37:33.043
- Sister!
- Sister, wait!

37:33.044 --> 37:35.804
- Where are you going?
- You can't do this! No, no!

37:36.364 --> 37:37.843
- Get back here! Sister!
- Sister!

37:37.844 --> 37:40.044
(SCRAPE)

37:42.004 --> 37:44.043
- I'd kill for a paper clip.
- (LAUGHS)

37:44.044 --> 37:46.883
- I know, this is funny.
- Picture tomorrow's headline:

37:46.884 --> 37:48.803
Houdini Can't Escape Watery Grave.

37:48.804 --> 37:52.403
That is rich, that all the headlines
will be about me, not you.

37:52.404 --> 37:54.604
Are you wearing a fixed collar?

37:55.244 --> 37:57.243
What are you doing? Yes!

37:57.244 --> 37:59.524
Yes! You've got stays, collar stays!

37:59.684 --> 38:01.844
- We're not dying today.
- Hurry.

38:01.964 --> 38:04.124
The water's rising.

38:05.204 --> 38:07.364
Dammit! Come on.

38:08.564 --> 38:11.524
They're wet. Come on. Come on.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.284
OK.

38:17.324 --> 38:19.123
(GRUNTS WITH EFFORT)

38:19.124 --> 38:21.324
Dammit! Give the other one.

38:21.964 --> 38:24.124
Give me your other collar stay!

38:37.084 --> 38:39.244
Doc?

38:40.924 --> 38:43.084
DOC!

38:47.844 --> 38:50.004
(SPLUTTERING)

38:52.004 --> 38:54.164
I had it.

38:57.644 --> 39:00.723
- Sister Grace told me where you were.
- Where is she?

39:00.724 --> 39:03.483
I know she's the killer.
I handcuffed her -- Where?

39:03.484 --> 39:07.284
- Sister Fabian's office.
- She's the killer and the third victim.

39:13.444 --> 39:15.604
Sister, please put that down.

39:16.804 --> 39:18.964
This place has seen enough sorrow.

39:20.204 --> 39:22.364
I have to die.

39:23.084 --> 39:25.243
You're a Catholic, talk to her.

39:25.244 --> 39:28.044
Sister, this is not what Lucy wants.

39:29.204 --> 39:31.364
Of course it is.

39:32.244 --> 39:34.724
- I let her die.
- That wasn't your fault.

39:40.164 --> 39:41.683
Keep going.

39:41.684 --> 39:48.404
Wherever Lucy is now, there is
no anger, there is no hatred.

39:49.684 --> 39:51.844
(SOBBING)

40:01.444 --> 40:03.604
(GASPS)

40:08.604 --> 40:10.764
I can feel her.

40:13.044 --> 40:15.204
I can feel her love.

40:16.604 --> 40:19.364
I can... I can feel her forgiveness.

40:21.804 --> 40:27.044
Lucy... your mother is here.

40:29.844 --> 40:32.684
If you can find it in your heart to
forgive her...

40:34.484 --> 40:36.644
...show yourself...

40:37.884 --> 40:40.044
now.

40:43.764 --> 40:46.763
Behold... your daughter!

40:46.764 --> 40:48.964
(FLUTTERING)

40:56.764 --> 40:58.924
My baby.

41:14.164 --> 41:16.603
- Come on, Sister.
- What the hell just happened?

41:16.604 --> 41:20.483
Subsonic vibrations. You can't
consciously hear or feel them

41:20.484 --> 41:22.643
but the waves stimulate the inner ear,

41:22.644 --> 41:26.763
causing a fight-or-flight response
- 'the chills'.

41:26.764 --> 41:29.283
The waves can excite the fluid
around the eyeball,

41:29.284 --> 41:31.963
causing irregularities in
the peripheral vision.

41:31.964 --> 41:33.803
The fleeing ghost.

41:33.804 --> 41:35.763
How'd you know when it would happen?

41:35.764 --> 41:38.963
The sound waves have a source,
the subway station up the street.

41:38.964 --> 41:42.283
London Bridge Station, built under
a year ago, about when Lucy died.

41:42.284 --> 41:44.923
And ever since then, every 17 minutes,

41:44.924 --> 41:48.164
a train passes below and
Lucy's ghost appears.

41:48.244 --> 41:49.763
So I needed you to stall.

41:49.764 --> 41:52.403
Luckily it was on time
or we'd have another nun to mop up.

41:52.404 --> 41:55.723
If all we saw was visual irregularity,

41:55.724 --> 41:57.924
then why did everyone who saw it...

41:58.044 --> 42:00.204
Why did WE think it was Lucy?

42:04.284 --> 42:06.764
The eyes only see what
the mind lets them.

42:08.364 --> 42:11.484
I have to admit, Harry,
I'm damn impressed.

42:12.244 --> 42:15.723
- Thank you, Arthur.
- Despite you being
an insufferable ass the entire time.

42:15.724 --> 42:19.243
Constable Stratton, how did you know
Sister Grace was the killer?

42:19.244 --> 42:21.323
Handwriting analysis.

42:21.324 --> 42:24.483
I noticed a similarity between
the writing on the window,

42:24.484 --> 42:27.523
and entries in the ledger
made by a certain 'AC'.

42:27.524 --> 42:30.124
Sister Grace's real
name is Alice Carlaw.

42:30.444 --> 42:34.124
Phew! Equally impressive.
Oh, come on, equally?

42:34.164 --> 42:36.523
How about if you include
me saving your life?

42:36.524 --> 42:38.883
Sweetie, I escape from liquid coffins

42:38.884 --> 42:41.644
four days a week, twice on Sundays.

42:43.084 --> 42:47.244
I'm looking forward to your new book,
my dining room table's lop-sided.

43:05.524 --> 43:07.843
I'm moving you upstairs.

43:07.844 --> 43:10.764
Mr Houdini seems to think
you've done a good job.

43:12.804 --> 43:16.163
Therefore, I assume you're having
an affair and when I have proof,

43:16.164 --> 43:21.004
I'll not only fire you, I'll make
sure no woman is ever hired again.
