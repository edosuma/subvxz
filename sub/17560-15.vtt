00:11.594 --> 00:12.846
What are you doing here?
It's 5:00 a.m.

00:12.929 --> 00:14.222
Just taking a little walk.

00:14.305 --> 00:16.265
You know, chatting with
the local hookers.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.602
They're really gussied up
for Valentine's Day.

00:19.686 --> 00:21.479
Okay, so, as long
as you're here

00:21.563 --> 00:23.106
grab some icing.

00:23.189 --> 00:24.941
We have to decorate
500 heart-shaped cookies

00:25.024 --> 00:26.151
before we open.

00:29.696 --> 00:31.239
[sighs]

00:34.033 --> 00:35.535
[sighs louder]

00:37.203 --> 00:39.706
Are you trying
to sigh something?

00:39.789 --> 00:41.207
Well, it's just that,
you know

00:41.291 --> 00:44.210
last night, I told Ben
that I loved him.

00:44.294 --> 00:45.545
So you've already done that.

00:45.628 --> 00:47.547
Uh-huh, yeah,
except the only problem is

00:47.630 --> 00:49.007
I called him Vince.

00:51.301 --> 00:52.469
That's not good.

00:53.511 --> 00:54.804
Out loud?

00:54.888 --> 00:56.681
Do you think I would've dragged
my butt out of bed

00:56.765 --> 00:58.725
at 5:00 in the morning
if I said it in my head?

01:00.059 --> 01:01.644
Oh, what's wrong with me?

01:01.728 --> 01:03.980
I mean, I love Ben,
and I'm dating Ben

01:04.063 --> 01:06.858
but why can't I stop
thinking about Vince?

01:06.941 --> 01:08.234
What should I do?

01:08.318 --> 01:10.737
It sounds to me like you really
need to take some time

01:10.820 --> 01:12.489
and figure out
how you feel, go.

01:14.657 --> 01:16.326
Okay, that's your big advice?

01:16.409 --> 01:18.578
The hookers gave me
more insight.

01:18.661 --> 01:20.914
Holly, I can't tell you
what to do.

01:20.997 --> 01:23.500
Yeah, well, Chablis did!

01:24.918 --> 01:26.169
Alright, look,
I could give you

01:26.252 --> 01:27.337
bunch of crap advice about

01:27.420 --> 01:28.755
how you have known Vince..

01:28.838 --> 01:30.882
for a long time
and how much it meant

01:30.965 --> 01:32.759
that Ben moved here
all the way from England.

01:32.842 --> 01:35.720
But I got a lot
of cookies to decorate here

01:35.804 --> 01:37.639
so, uh, here's what
we're gonna do.

01:37.722 --> 01:40.683
Alright. Ben and Vince
are both hanging from a cliff

01:40.767 --> 01:42.060
and you've got to
pick one to save.

01:42.143 --> 01:44.145
Which is it gonna be?
Quick, pick one.

01:44.229 --> 01:45.563
Why are they on a cliff?

01:46.731 --> 01:49.067
I don't know.
You're on a ski trip.

01:49.150 --> 01:51.277
- Ben can't ski.
- Holly.

01:51.361 --> 01:54.322
Look, we open in two hours.
We really gotta move this along.

01:54.405 --> 01:56.616
- Pick one!
- Help me.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.830
[imitates English accent]
Holly, please!

02:01.913 --> 02:04.374
Pick me!
Save me from the cliff!

02:06.417 --> 02:07.585
Or..

02:07.669 --> 02:09.419
[imitates Vince]
Yo, Holly, dude..

02:09.503 --> 02:12.090
It'd be really rad
if you'd pick me.

02:14.259 --> 02:16.302
You're really bad at that.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.096
I know.
Pick one!

02:18.179 --> 02:19.597
I can't decide.

02:19.681 --> 02:23.184
Okay, I'm just gonna
jump off the cliff by myself.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.394
So all three of you are dead.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.688
Yeah, hope you're happy, Val!

02:28.231 --> 02:29.357

03:12.775 --> 03:14.527
The cookies are ready.

03:14.611 --> 03:16.195
What happened to my
heart-shaped cookies?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.780
They're all broken in half.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.866
Who is gonna buy
broken heart-shaped cookies

03:19.949 --> 03:21.284
on Valentine's Day?

03:21.367 --> 03:23.703
The depressed
and the bitter.

03:25.580 --> 03:28.541
Gary, what am I gonna do?

03:28.625 --> 03:30.960
Valentine's Day is the busiest
day of the year in a bakery.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.004
I can't have her moping around
here all day with that sourpuss.

03:33.087 --> 03:34.505
She's gonna drive away
all the customers.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.549
Well, you wanna take care
of that sourpuss?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.385
Get that sourpuss
a boyfriend.

03:39.469 --> 03:42.680
You know, that's not a bad idea.
Good work, Gary.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.015
You know, some people might say

03:44.098 --> 03:45.642
<i>thank you</i> with a bonus.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.395
You were two hours late for work

03:49.479 --> 03:50.480
and you broke the mixer.

03:50.563 --> 03:52.315
Be happy you have a job.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.609
Damn. Man, it wasn't doing
what it was supposed to do.

03:54.692 --> 03:56.653
It ain't my fault.

03:56.736 --> 03:57.779
Here's what I'm gonna do.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.905
I am gonna make up

03:58.988 --> 04:00.281
a secret admirer for her.

04:00.365 --> 04:01.908
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

04:01.991 --> 04:03.534
it'll make her feel
better about herself

04:03.618 --> 04:04.911
and it will get us
through the day.

04:04.994 --> 04:06.037
Yeah, that could work.

04:06.120 --> 04:07.580
And again, I'm sorry
about the mixer

04:07.664 --> 04:09.332
but I really thought
I could fit it in.

04:11.459 --> 04:13.044
Happy Valentine's Day.

04:13.127 --> 04:15.463
- 'Hey.'
- Hi.

04:15.546 --> 04:17.507
So, Val, I made my decision.

04:17.589 --> 04:19.926
And in six minutes, a plane
is gonna come flying by

04:20.009 --> 04:22.553
that says, "Holly loves Ben.
Happy Valentine's Day."

04:22.637 --> 04:23.930
- So Ben, huh?
- Yep.

04:24.013 --> 04:25.223
Ben's the one I love.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.934
He's the one who I
save from the cliff.

04:28.017 --> 04:29.269
What made you pick him?

04:29.352 --> 04:31.771
Well, I just did a lot
of thinking about it

04:31.854 --> 04:33.439
and, you know,
I've known Vince so long

04:33.523 --> 04:35.358
but if we were supposed
to be together, we would be.

04:35.441 --> 04:37.777
But there's always
something, and I love Ben.

04:37.860 --> 04:40.238
- He's incredible.
- Oh, you made the right choice.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.657
- I think so.
- Oh, look, there is Ben.

04:43.574 --> 04:45.368
Oh! The man I love.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.287
Hi! Okay, so it's 10:59.
We have to go outside right now.

04:48.371 --> 04:49.664
Uh, do you think
it could wait a second--

04:49.747 --> 04:51.249
No, no, no,
I have something to tell you.

04:51.332 --> 04:52.333
Okay, I have something
to tell you.

04:52.417 --> 04:53.793
Oh, we have to do it outside.

04:53.876 --> 04:55.044
- Why, it's cold out there.
- Come on, let's go.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.129
I think I'm getting the change.

04:56.212 --> 04:57.839
It's really hot in here.

04:59.882 --> 05:03.136
Okay, so, here's what
I wanted to tell you..

05:03.219 --> 05:05.972
[plane flying overhead]
...Ben

05:06.055 --> 05:07.890
Uh, Ho-Holly, do you mind
if I go first?

05:07.974 --> 05:10.101
Oh, great idea.
Go ahead.

05:10.184 --> 05:12.020
Okay, um, Holly

05:12.103 --> 05:13.521
you know how I feel about you.

05:13.604 --> 05:15.106
You know that I'm in love
with you.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.817
Me too..

05:19.152 --> 05:21.821
Holly, can we talk
someplace quieter?

05:21.904 --> 05:23.573
Okay..

05:23.656 --> 05:25.241
[plane flying overhead]

05:25.324 --> 05:27.160
Well, actually, I..
This can't really wait.

05:27.243 --> 05:31.080
Um, Holly, you still have
feelings for Vince.

05:31.914 --> 05:33.624
I think we should break up.

05:35.334 --> 05:37.086
Oh, my damn.

05:37.170 --> 05:39.672
Wait. What?

05:39.756 --> 05:41.007
I'm sorry.

05:41.090 --> 05:44.677
I've been hoping that this
was my imagination, but..

05:44.761 --> 05:46.304
Holly, last night,
you looked into my eyes

05:46.387 --> 05:48.264
and you said,
"I love you, Vince."

05:48.347 --> 05:50.141
Okay, Ben, that was
just a slip of the tongue.

05:50.224 --> 05:51.517
I love you.

05:51.601 --> 05:53.227
What I'm saying is, I think
you should take some time

05:53.311 --> 05:54.353
to explore these feelings.

05:54.437 --> 05:57.190
Explore?
Who do you think I am?

05:57.273 --> 05:58.608
Damn, I don't know
any explorers.

05:58.691 --> 05:59.901
Why did I quit college?

05:59.984 --> 06:03.029
Okay, look, the point is
I don't need to explore.

06:03.112 --> 06:04.405
I know how I feel about you

06:04.489 --> 06:06.574
and I know how I feel
about Vince.

06:06.657 --> 06:08.701
I don't need
to think about it.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.581
Well, then I need
to think about it.

06:18.586 --> 06:20.004
Did that just happen?

06:24.133 --> 06:25.218
By the way, sweetie

Ponce de Leon..

[instrumental music]

06:40.066 --> 06:43.402
Oh, my damn!
Oh, my damn, oh, my damn!

06:43.486 --> 06:45.738
I've been trying to call you
for half an hour.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.574
Whoa-whoa, why the hell you
ain't answering your phone?

06:48.658 --> 06:51.077
- I dropped it in the toilet.
- What?

06:52.578 --> 06:54.413
Aah!

06:54.497 --> 06:55.623
And now it's broken.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.001
So, listen, man,
I've been sitting here

06:59.085 --> 07:00.711
thinking about Holly and me.

07:00.795 --> 07:03.131
It's Valentine's Day,
and I'm wasting my time

07:03.214 --> 07:05.466
thinking about a girl who's
in love with someone else.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.552
So you know what?
I'm over it.

07:07.635 --> 07:10.096
I'm sick of chasing
after a dream!

07:10.179 --> 07:12.431
I mean, I slept with Tina,
hoping that would get me

07:12.515 --> 07:15.434
to move on and
I still feel bad about that.

07:16.394 --> 07:17.603
Nothing good has come from this.

07:17.687 --> 07:20.982
It's time to accept it's over.

07:21.065 --> 07:24.277
Yeah? Well, uh,
that's a damn shame.

07:24.360 --> 07:25.903
Because I just came back
from the bakery

07:25.987 --> 07:27.655
where Ben has just
broken up with Holly

07:27.738 --> 07:30.324
because he thinks she still
has feelings for you.

07:31.868 --> 07:34.495
I know. I can't
believe it myself.

07:34.579 --> 07:37.123
She hires a plane
to fly across the sky

07:37.206 --> 07:40.126
with a big-ass banner
that says "Holly loves Ben."

07:40.209 --> 07:41.794
Now, right while this plane
is flying by

07:41.878 --> 07:44.463
he breaks it to her.
"Holly," he says..

07:47.842 --> 07:48.801
Ain't that about something?

07:48.885 --> 07:49.969
That's some cold-blooded stuff.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.971
Now, I gotta hop
all the way over here..

08:06.527 --> 08:08.613
(Lauren)
Ha ha ha!

08:08.696 --> 08:10.156
Lauren, what are you doing?

08:10.239 --> 08:12.074
Those freaks were having
a giggle-fest

08:12.158 --> 08:13.409
and it was making me sick.

08:13.492 --> 08:14.911
Shh.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.079
Okay, just go
clean that table.

08:18.748 --> 08:20.583

08:20.666 --> 08:23.002

08:23.085 --> 08:24.212

08:28.883 --> 08:31.344

I've got a secret admirer.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.971
Oh, my God, look.

08:34.054 --> 08:36.182
"I've been watching you
from across the street.

08:36.265 --> 08:38.643
"I've been too shy to come in
and talk to you face to face

08:38.726 --> 08:42.270
"so I can only write
my feelings.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.690
"Oh, Lauren,
how your glistening thighs

08:44.774 --> 08:47.068
'and firm buttocks
make me quiver."'

08:49.278 --> 08:51.822
I thought your letter needed
a little embellishment.

08:51.906 --> 08:52.782
Ahem.

08:52.865 --> 08:54.075
"Your bosoms are like

'ready to be devoured."'

08:59.163 --> 09:00.456
Oh, my God

09:00.539 --> 09:02.291
I think I found my soul mate.

09:04.293 --> 09:05.836
He's meeting me
here at 5:00.

09:07.797 --> 09:09.382
Sweetie, that is great!

[giggles]

09:10.675 --> 09:12.385
Uh, Gary.

09:12.468 --> 09:14.762
Hmm, wow, I wonder why
he would tell her

09:14.845 --> 09:17.181
that he's meeting her here
instead of staying secret

09:17.265 --> 09:19.934
and mysterious
and non-existent, I wonder.

09:20.017 --> 09:22.770
Maybe he didn't think
his plan all the way through.

09:26.274 --> 09:28.192
Okay, well, what are we gonna do
when 5:00 rolls around

09:28.276 --> 09:29.485
and he doesn't show?

09:29.568 --> 09:31.404
Call and let me know.
I get off at 4:00.

09:36.993 --> 09:39.161
[knocking on door]

09:48.087 --> 09:49.880
Vince.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.007
Hi.

09:52.091 --> 09:54.760
Um, look, I can't really
talk right now.

09:54.844 --> 09:57.555
You don't have to.
I know everything.

09:57.638 --> 09:58.597
Everything?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.099
What do you mean everything?

10:00.182 --> 10:01.892
Gary told me
about you and Ben.

10:04.478 --> 10:07.898
- Can I come in?
- Um, sure.

10:10.943 --> 10:13.112
So, can I get you
something to drink?

10:13.195 --> 10:14.530
Or how about some carrot cake?

10:14.613 --> 10:16.032
'Cause we got some really
great carrot cake.

10:16.115 --> 10:19.160
It's, um, got- got
lots of carrots in it.

10:20.703 --> 10:23.497
- Holly, I just wanna talk.
- Oh, great, talking is great.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.124
I love to talk,
you know, funny

10:25.207 --> 10:27.084
because talking is really
underrated these days--

10:27.168 --> 10:28.377
- Come with me.
- Okay.

10:32.882 --> 10:35.843
Holly, do you still
have feelings for me?

10:35.926 --> 10:37.428
I don't know.

10:37.511 --> 10:38.554
Maybe.

10:38.637 --> 10:40.014
I might. Could be.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.807
But Ben and I just broke up.

10:41.891 --> 10:44.477
Oh, my God,
so you do have feelings. Sorry.

10:44.560 --> 10:46.520
Ahem. I'm the guy.
I'm supposed to be the cool one.

10:46.604 --> 10:47.980
Okay, wait..

10:48.064 --> 10:50.816
Are you telling me that you
still have feelings for me?

10:50.900 --> 10:52.485
Why else would I be here?

10:52.568 --> 10:54.487
Yeah, but when did this
all happen?

10:54.570 --> 10:56.822
I mean, when I came home
from Paris

10:56.906 --> 10:58.824
you said that you had
all sorts of girlfriends

10:58.908 --> 11:00.534
and you weren't
the commitment type.

11:00.618 --> 11:01.577
Well, what do you want?

11:01.660 --> 11:02.661
I see you walking off the plane

11:02.745 --> 11:03.829
hanging all over another guy.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.040
Wait.
You were at the airport?

11:06.123 --> 11:09.418
Yeah.
With your favorite flowers.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.462
Why didn't you tell me?

11:11.545 --> 11:13.339
You looked so happy
with someone else

11:13.422 --> 11:15.049
and I didn't want
to screw that up for you.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.681
Holly, I knew
I was in love with you

11:22.765 --> 11:24.850
the second you told me
you were going to Paris

11:24.934 --> 11:26.519
and I haven't stopped since.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.312
Oh, my God.

11:28.396 --> 11:30.689
Vince, I had no idea.

11:30.773 --> 11:32.400
Yeah, well, I'm very subtle.

11:35.569 --> 11:36.695
So, what do we do now?

11:36.779 --> 11:37.905
I don't know.

11:37.988 --> 11:40.825
I mean, this is all
happening so fast.

11:40.908 --> 11:42.868
Just this morning,
I was hiring planes for Ben

11:42.952 --> 11:44.787
because I thought
I was in love with him.

11:44.870 --> 11:47.373
But now, I mean..

11:47.456 --> 11:50.793
Okay, look, I just don't want
to screw anything else up.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.379
Uh, that's cool.
We'll take it slow.

11:53.462 --> 11:55.256
Okay, good.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.549
Because, Vince--

11:59.468 --> 12:00.678
Slow enough?

12:02.930 --> 12:04.432
Vince, I'm serious.

12:04.515 --> 12:06.392
I'm sorry.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.437
Look, until I can
figure out how I feel

12:09.520 --> 12:11.689
we are just
two friends, okay?

12:11.772 --> 12:14.316
One of which just got out
of a very serious relationship

12:14.400 --> 12:16.068
and doesn't know
what they want.

12:16.152 --> 12:17.236
That's me.

12:18.863 --> 12:20.906
Look, Holly,
I totally get it.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.533
Take all the time you need.

12:22.616 --> 12:24.326
Just call me
when you're ready, okay?

12:27.580 --> 12:29.540
- Vince?
- What?

12:29.623 --> 12:30.958
No, it's nothing.

12:35.671 --> 12:36.964
What?

12:37.047 --> 12:39.550
It's just..

12:39.633 --> 12:41.802
We tried this before

12:41.886 --> 12:43.929
but something always
got in the way.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.515
There were other girls
and lies.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.184
Holly

12:48.267 --> 12:50.436
there are no other girls.

12:50.519 --> 12:51.937
There are no lies.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.314
You know everything.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.164
Okay, well, Vince,
I said to take it slow.

13:10.247 --> 13:11.832
[chuckles]

13:11.916 --> 13:15.002
[instrumental music]

13:22.676 --> 13:24.803
[instrumental music]

13:24.887 --> 13:27.806
Thank you, man!
Thank you, thank you, thank you!

13:27.890 --> 13:29.683
Okay, now!
Hey! It's Valentine's Day..

13:29.767 --> 13:31.352
People are starting
to get the wrong idea.

13:31.435 --> 13:33.896
Let 'em.
I love ya, Gary!

13:33.979 --> 13:35.898
Happy Valentine's Day!

13:37.733 --> 13:41.070
And then I found out that Vince
still has feelings for me.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.571
And I shouldn't be so excited

13:42.655 --> 13:45.824
because of what just happened
with Ben, but, I am!

13:45.908 --> 13:47.159
Am I a horrible person?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.494
No, you're not horrible.

13:48.577 --> 13:49.995
You can't help
the way you feel.

13:50.079 --> 13:51.580
Okay, and, hello,
can we just talk about

13:51.664 --> 13:53.415
what a good Valentine's Day
you're having?

13:54.500 --> 13:55.834
And then I told her
I loved her

13:55.918 --> 13:57.002
and that I always loved her

13:57.086 --> 13:58.170
and I was at the airport..

13:58.254 --> 13:59.713
Standing there with flowers

13:59.797 --> 14:02.341
waiting for me
and I had no idea.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.134
This whole time, I had no idea

14:04.218 --> 14:05.844
that he still had feelings
for me.

14:05.928 --> 14:08.138
And, obviously, I feel
the same way about him

14:08.222 --> 14:09.515
because look at me, Tina!

14:09.598 --> 14:11.934
Look at me, Gary,
I think this is the happiest day

14:12.017 --> 14:14.853
I have ever spent
on this Earth!

14:14.937 --> 14:16.105
So what's the deal with Ben?

14:16.188 --> 14:17.856
I don't think
it's his happiest day.

14:19.608 --> 14:20.985
I mean, Ben is the one
who told me

14:21.068 --> 14:22.444
that I still had
feelings for Vince.

14:22.528 --> 14:25.364
And he let me go because
he wanted me to explore them.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.825
You know, like Magellan
or Columbus.

14:28.909 --> 14:31.245
Hey, wait, did Vince
say anything else?

14:31.328 --> 14:33.414
Yeah, he told me everything.

14:34.498 --> 14:35.874
Everything?

14:35.958 --> 14:38.544
Everything! I told her
how I loved her for months

14:38.627 --> 14:40.296
how it killed me every time
she was with Ben--

14:40.379 --> 14:43.215
- Did you tell her about Tina?
- What's that?

14:43.299 --> 14:44.550
You know.
Tina.

14:44.633 --> 14:46.260
Her best friend
who you slept with.

14:46.343 --> 14:48.095
Oh, why would I
tell her that?

14:48.178 --> 14:50.472
Tina and I promised each other
we would never tell her.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.558
Why-why does anybody need
to know that

14:52.641 --> 14:55.227
or talk about it
ever again, Gary?

14:55.311 --> 14:56.979
It happened once.

14:57.062 --> 14:58.814
It's over.
It's forgotten.

14:58.897 --> 15:02.234
Yes, Tina,
he told me everything.

15:02.318 --> 15:03.902
And you're not mad?

15:03.986 --> 15:05.195
No.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.406
Well, I mean,
at first I was

15:07.489 --> 15:09.533
but then he explained to me
that the only reason

15:09.617 --> 15:11.744
why he didn't tell me
is because he didn't wanna

15:11.827 --> 15:13.120
screw up our relationship.

15:13.203 --> 15:16.248
Oh!
Thank you, God.

15:16.332 --> 15:18.250
Do you have any idea
how guilty I felt?

15:18.334 --> 15:20.669
I swear, it only happened
because I was so depressed

15:20.753 --> 15:21.962
over my married doctor,
you know.

15:22.046 --> 15:23.505
And we only had sex
that one time.

15:23.589 --> 15:24.757
And Vince and I swore
to each other

15:24.840 --> 15:26.425
that it would never
happen again

15:26.508 --> 15:27.593
and it didn't because you are

15:27.676 --> 15:29.678
my best friend
and it is over.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.930
And I am so relieved.

15:33.390 --> 15:35.100
You and Vince had sex?

15:35.893 --> 15:37.269
I'm sorry, what?

15:39.063 --> 15:41.148
You and Vince had sex?

15:42.650 --> 15:44.026
No.

15:44.109 --> 15:46.445
- What?
- You said he told you!

15:46.528 --> 15:48.906
You said that you were mad at
first but then you understood

15:48.989 --> 15:50.783
because he didn't wanna
screw up our relationship!

15:50.866 --> 15:54.119
Mine and Ben's,
not yours and mine.

15:54.203 --> 15:56.830
Oh, my God, that was a huge
misinterpretation on my part.

16:00.376 --> 16:03.462
[instrumental music]

16:08.759 --> 16:12.096
Aw, hey,
don't you just love love

16:12.179 --> 16:14.139
lovers?

16:14.223 --> 16:16.850
Aw, look how my words
touched her.

16:16.934 --> 16:17.935
Yeah, well,
what are we gonna do

16:18.018 --> 16:19.311
when 5:00 rolls around

16:19.395 --> 16:22.564
and her secret admirer
isn't gonna touch her?

16:22.648 --> 16:24.483
Maybe I could write her
another note

16:24.566 --> 16:25.526
tell her I had an accident

16:25.609 --> 16:26.610
and I can no longer perform

16:26.694 --> 16:28.821
my manly duties.

16:28.904 --> 16:30.906
God forbid, poo poo poo,
bite your tongue.

16:33.409 --> 16:34.785
Uh-oh.

16:34.868 --> 16:38.038
Someone wooks a wittle wonely
on walentine's day.

16:38.122 --> 16:39.748
- How can you tell?
- I don't know.

16:39.832 --> 16:41.333
It could be this book.

16:41.417 --> 16:44.712
"Surviving Valentine's Day
When You're Alone Like a Dog."

16:47.256 --> 16:49.049
It should've never
gone this far.

16:49.133 --> 16:50.801
I mean, she's not as tough
as she seems.

16:50.884 --> 16:53.637
Underneath that bitter,
angry exterior

16:53.721 --> 16:57.057
is a sweet, vulnerable,
sensitive, loving

16:57.141 --> 16:59.226
lonely little cupcake.

17:00.227 --> 17:01.603
She doesn't look
too lonely to me.

17:01.687 --> 17:03.731
[both laughing]

17:03.814 --> 17:06.483
You are a very funny lady.

17:06.567 --> 17:07.943
Yeah, I know.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.570
But let me tell you
something, Stew.

17:10.654 --> 17:14.074
A mere hour ago, I was
a big old sad sack like you

17:14.157 --> 17:17.118
but then, all of a sudden,
a beautiful card arrives

17:17.202 --> 17:19.121
from a man
who appreciates fine fruit

17:19.204 --> 17:20.914
and it rocked my world.

17:22.165 --> 17:24.542
So you already
have a boyfriend?

17:24.626 --> 17:27.253
Yeah, I'm a-taken.

17:27.337 --> 17:28.672
But, you know, it's too bad
I didn't meet you

17:28.756 --> 17:30.382
when I was single
back in the day.

17:32.968 --> 17:35.763
- My loss.
- Okay, bye.

17:38.390 --> 17:41.727
Why-why did you tell
that guy you were a-taken?

17:41.810 --> 17:43.187
Well, 'cause I have
a boyfriend

17:43.270 --> 17:45.063
and he's gonna be here
any minute.

17:45.147 --> 17:47.024
Hey, are my melons even?

17:47.107 --> 17:49.651
Yeah, actually, the left one's
a little lower.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.695
Lauren..

17:51.779 --> 17:53.530
...he seemed
like a really nice guy.

17:53.614 --> 17:55.532
Maybe you should go out
for a drink with him.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.409
Uh, Val,
I'm not a cheater.

17:58.702 --> 18:00.496
Lauren..

18:00.579 --> 18:01.914
...about your secret admirer

18:03.123 --> 18:05.250
there is no secret admirer.

18:05.334 --> 18:06.627
Gary made him up!

18:08.462 --> 18:10.923
Okay, we both did.

18:11.006 --> 18:12.466
There is no secret admirer?

18:12.549 --> 18:14.301
No, I'm so, so sorry.

18:14.384 --> 18:16.053
It's just you looked
so sad this morning

18:16.136 --> 18:17.429
and I wanted you to be happy
so you wouldn't--

18:17.513 --> 18:19.264
Oh, my God.

18:19.348 --> 18:24.394
That is the sweetest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

18:24.478 --> 18:27.606
You're the best friend
I've ever had, you know?

18:27.689 --> 18:28.774
It just felt good
to be wanted

18:28.857 --> 18:30.776
even if it was
a fake guy.

18:30.859 --> 18:32.069
Thank you.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.030
Uh, hey!

18:35.114 --> 18:37.699
Um, Stew left his card

18:37.783 --> 18:39.743
and he's a real guy.

18:39.827 --> 18:41.745
Maybe you could
give him a call.

18:41.829 --> 18:43.539
No, it doesn't really
feel right.

18:43.622 --> 18:45.791
I mean, I just got out
of a relationship, and it's..

18:47.000 --> 18:48.585
Dr. Stewart Rosen.

18:48.669 --> 18:50.337
Doctor?
Excuse me!

18:52.172 --> 18:53.257
Hey, hey.

18:53.340 --> 18:55.092
Good work.
She got a doctor.

18:55.175 --> 18:57.970
Yeah, a rug doctor.

18:58.053 --> 19:00.973
Yeah, he's in the carpet
cleaning business.

19:01.056 --> 19:03.100
I just didn't want her
to miss a chance.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.103
Aw, Gary and Val..

19:06.186 --> 19:07.896
bakery workers by day

19:07.980 --> 19:09.690
matchmakers by night.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.859
I think our work here
is done.

19:11.942 --> 19:14.820
No, actually, you still have
to mop the kitchen.

19:14.903 --> 19:16.154
I'm crippled.
You're cruel.

19:21.451 --> 19:23.203
- Hey.
- Hey!

19:23.287 --> 19:24.538
I'm so glad you called.

19:24.621 --> 19:26.832
This "Taking it slow" stuff
is killing me.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.252
Okay, look,
we need to talk.

19:30.335 --> 19:31.795
I need to talk to you, too.
Let's go outside.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.380
- No, let's just do it here.
- Come on.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.715
It's so much
more romantic.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.384
Okay, here's what
I wanted to tell you.

19:37.467 --> 19:39.511
Okay, Vince, please,
can we just go inside?

19:39.595 --> 19:42.639
- In one second, Holly, okay?
- No, look, I'm freezing.

19:42.723 --> 19:44.850
In-in one second..

19:44.933 --> 19:46.059
Please, Holly.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.228
Okay, look,
Vince, this can't wait.

19:48.312 --> 19:50.230
Yeah, okay,
