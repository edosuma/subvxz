Well, not great, you know?

00:35.202 --> 00:37.955
Things have been a little...
rough, to be honest.

00:37.955 --> 00:40.499
You know, I haven't booked a job
since I posted that manifesto,

00:40.499 --> 00:43.627
and a Ford Fusion is no place to live, so.

00:44.253 --> 00:45.254
- Yeah.
- I can't believe they let you back

00:45.254 --> 00:47.381

trouble you used to cause.

01:05.607 --> 01:06.984
I'm sorry your life sucks,

01:06.984 --> 01:08.735
but I fucked someone
I wasn't supposed to,

01:08.735 --> 01:11.238
so I have to get to wardrobe right now.

01:11.238 --> 01:12.739
Okay. Roger that.

01:12.739 --> 01:14.575

do you like my mom?

01:32.009 --> 01:33.719

'cause if it was one of those
"wham bam thank you, Mom" situations,

01:46.857 --> 01:48.692

01:49.693 --> 01:51.570
She was dating this guy

I don't know what you're talkin' about.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.378
Oh, well, I guess I just got visited
by the Spanx fairy then.

04:54.586 --> 04:56.880
Sweetie, it's Hollywood.

04:56.880 --> 05:00.133
There's not an actress over 40
raw doggin' it these days.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.345
- Charming.
- Just be careful wearing them on a date.

05:03.345 --> 05:04.555
When a man undresses you,

05:04.555 --> 05:07.599
you expand like one
of those mattresses in a box.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.060
Well, I haven't had to worry
about that in a while.

05:10.060 --> 05:13.146
Why? Oh, sorry.
Couldn't help but overhear.

05:13.146 --> 05:16.066
Because I haven't been
on a first date in 15 years.

05:16.692 --> 05:18.569
That's since I was six years old.

05:18.569 --> 05:20.988
Why is everyone trying to hurt me today?

05:20.988 --> 05:22.406
Okay, look, we gotta fix this,

05:22.406 --> 05:26.159
take you out,
help you meet some hot zaddies.

05:26.159 --> 05:27.494
What are you doing tomorrow night?

05:27.494 --> 05:30.163
I can't, I am so behind on <i>Cupcake Wars.</i>

05:31.164 --> 05:32.916
I just heard myself.
Where do you wanna go?

05:32.916 --> 05:35.502
Let's get some dinner
and then go someplace fun.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.004
What do you wanna eat: sushi or Mexican?

05:37.004 --> 05:39.506
- Mexican.
- I'd go for sushi.

05:39.506 --> 05:42.759
- Fuck off, Lana!
- Ooh, somebody's hangry.

05:46.597 --> 05:48.015
- Shorter?
- Yeah.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.690
- There's my guy.
- Oh god.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.442
Got a hot little tip for ya.

05:58.442 --> 06:00.611
You know that special lady
you've been crushin' on?

06:00.611 --> 06:03.405
- You mean, your mom?
- It's her birthday Saturday.

06:03.405 --> 06:06.700
I scored us a res at the O-G,
Olive Garden.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.619
Let's just say if you were
to show up at the table

06:08.619 --> 06:11.079
with the never-ending breadsticks,
she would not be mad.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.957
Oh, hell yes.
As long as it's not Saturday, I'm in.

06:13.957 --> 06:15.959
Oh, I just said it was Saturday.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.962
Oh, what about brunch on Sunday?

06:20.297 --> 06:25.052
We need to find a way
to bring Whitney and Josie closer.

06:25.052 --> 06:29.848
Okay. What if...
there's a, a hot delivery guy

06:29.848 --> 06:33.268
and both girls are ordering
all this stuff they don't even want

06:33.268 --> 06:34.561
just so they can see the guy.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.272
And then on the way out,
there's, like, a big box,

06:37.272 --> 06:39.316
he trips over the box

06:39.316 --> 06:43.320
'cause hot plus clumsy, always funny.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.446
Right?
Yeah, so, in real life,

06:44.446 --> 06:46.907
people don't just
magically trip over things

06:46.907 --> 06:48.700
the exact moment you need them to.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.202
They can if you write that.

06:50.202 --> 06:51.828
I wanna do something less sitcom-y,

06:51.828 --> 06:55.123
or, you know, at least something
that passes the Bechdel test.

06:55.123 --> 06:56.792
- What?

06:56.792 --> 07:00.045
Something that passes the Bechdel test.

07:00.045 --> 07:03.799
No, I heard her...
I just don't know what the fuck that is.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.802
Guys, let's go easy on him.
He's old.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.595
I heard that, too, Carrot Top.

07:08.595 --> 07:10.514
Or Carrot Bottom,
I don't wanna make assumptions.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.182
To pass the Bechdel test,

07:12.182 --> 07:14.810
the script must have at least
one exchange between two women

07:14.810 --> 07:16.728
where they're not talking about a man.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.648
Is she still talkin'?
'Cause I dozed off.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.901
This is probably too meta,
but--

07:22.901 --> 07:23.944
Oh my god.

07:23.944 --> 07:26.405
This is exciting,
she's got somethin' here.

07:26.405 --> 07:30.617
What if they bond by talking
about Alison Bechdel?

07:30.617 --> 07:33.120
- That's hilarious.

07:33.120 --> 07:36.582
Oh, I like that.
- All right, I, I also get why it's funny.

07:36.582 --> 07:38.333
Um, can I speak to you
for a second outside?

07:38.333 --> 07:39.585
Yeah.

07:40.419 --> 07:41.628
What's the problem?

07:42.129 --> 07:45.132
I was under the impression
we're still makin' a comedy.

07:45.132 --> 07:49.011
Oh my god, just because they're
not pitching, like, old-timey jokes

07:49.011 --> 07:52.306
- doesn't m--
- No, no, no. They're not
pitching jokes period.

07:52.306 --> 07:54.808
So, comedy's evolved since
you last wrote for television.

07:54.808 --> 07:56.685
I mean, honestly,
whole species have evolved.

07:56.685 --> 07:58.729
Listen, we don't schlep in
a live audience every week

07:58.729 --> 08:01.690
so they can sit there and nod
in thoughtful amusement.

08:01.690 --> 08:03.400
We need them to actually laugh.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.278
Yeah, I get it, and trust me,
these writers are very funny.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.905
I--

08:07.905 --> 08:09.364
The bathroom is that way?

08:09.364 --> 08:12.701
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, A-Azmina.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.077
Funniest food?

08:14.077 --> 08:17.706
Uh, I don't know. Uh, oatmeal.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.211
Oatmeal... Aren't you embarrassed?

08:22.211 --> 08:23.879
It's pickles.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.088
Pickles?

08:28.008 --> 08:30.928
Okay. Let's get this on its feet.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.096
Or maybe I should say on its back.

08:34.264 --> 08:35.974
Jake, you're in the hall.

08:35.974 --> 08:38.227
Lawrence is on top of Josie.

08:38.727 --> 08:40.604
I'm on top of her, huh?
Uh-huh, yeah.

08:40.604 --> 08:42.606
Oh, okay. Umm.

08:42.606 --> 08:45.359
All right, so... so we'll
mock the kissing.

08:45.359 --> 08:47.194
Oh my god,
I'm gonna punch you in the face.

08:47.194 --> 08:49.446
And action!

08:49.446 --> 08:50.447
All right, wow.

08:50.948 --> 08:52.950
Looks like we have
the house all to ourselves.

08:52.950 --> 08:54.326
Mm.
And you're kissing.

08:54.326 --> 08:56.537
- Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss.
- Kiss, kiss. Kiss, kiss.

08:56.537 --> 08:59.373
Now the canoodling's
getting hot and heavy.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.666
All right.

09:00.666 --> 09:04.670
Very nice. Humpy, humpy... Very nice.

09:06.630 --> 09:08.632
- Um.
- Okay, what is that?

09:08.632 --> 09:10.926
- Nothing, it's nothing.
- Doesn't feel like nothing.

09:10.926 --> 09:13.679
- Don't mind me, just lookin' for my keys.

09:13.679 --> 09:14.930
Jake!

09:14.930 --> 09:17.975
Ah, ah, ah, I think it's funnier
if you stay on top of her.

09:17.975 --> 09:20.143
- You want me to stay on top of her?
- Yeah.

09:20.143 --> 09:20.978
Oh.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.189
- Oh boy.
- But... there's, you know,

09:24.189 --> 09:25.774
in terms of the momentum of the scene--

09:25.774 --> 09:28.527
- Jer, I think Reed wants to get off now.
- Not, Not what I said.

09:28.527 --> 09:31.280
Okay, fine, Lawrence
gets out of the bed.

09:31.280 --> 09:35.993
Uh, uh, or, or, uh, here's a thought.
Lawrence stays in bed.

09:35.993 --> 09:37.494
You don't wanna get outta bed?

09:37.494 --> 09:38.829
I really don't.

09:38.829 --> 09:40.706
Jerry, is it funny if
I pull off the covers--

09:40.706 --> 09:42.624
No, no, no, nope. Nope, not funny.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.419
Oh, I get it.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.087
It's no big deal, everyone,

09:47.087 --> 09:49.173
Reed just has an erection.
- Yep!

09:49.173 --> 09:50.799
- Let's take five

09:50.799 --> 09:52.801
on account of Reed's erection.

09:52.801 --> 09:55.637
Hey, uh, Jerry, is this
a hard five or a soft five?

09:55.637 --> 09:57.639
- Unbelievable.

09:57.639 --> 10:00.767
That's-- Really, Really, Jerry?
You don't laugh in 56 years. That got you?

10:08.859 --> 10:12.112
Right, so, uh, where did
we leave off yesterday?

10:12.112 --> 10:15.073
Gordon pitched that Caitlyn Jenner joke
and then you threw an orange at him.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.576
- It was a tangelo.
- Yeah, that's the important part.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.828
Okay, right. I mean, uh, before that.

10:19.828 --> 10:23.707
Uh, we talked about the fight
you and your dad had in the kitchen.

10:23.707 --> 10:26.168
And a lot of other fights
you two have had.

10:26.168 --> 10:29.296
And then we watched
an episode of <i>Yellowjackets.</i>

10:29.296 --> 10:33.300
I will admit I was
a bit... thrown yesterday,

10:33.300 --> 10:34.301
but, today, we are--

10:34.301 --> 10:35.260
Good news, everyone.

10:35.260 --> 10:37.721
The comedy cavalry has arrived.

10:37.721 --> 10:40.891
Good morning! Delivery from Jews 'R' Us.

10:40.891 --> 10:43.936
Sorry we're late, we've been wandering
in Palm Desert for 40 years.

10:43.936 --> 10:45.229
Ignore these old fucks.

10:45.229 --> 10:46.522
They saw some actress out there

10:46.522 --> 10:48.732
and they got their first
hard-ons in 20 years.

10:48.732 --> 10:50.651
- Let me introduce everybody.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.028
This is Alan, Bob, Selma.

10:53.028 --> 10:55.948
Say hello to Benny, Janae, and Azmina.

10:56.406 --> 10:59.243
Azmina...
I think I take that for my gout.

10:59.243 --> 11:02.329
Azmina, that's a Spanish name,
if I'm not mistaken.

11:02.329 --> 11:04.540
- Sorta.
- My first wife was Latin.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.959
Case you ever wonder
why I'm scared of you.

11:09.253 --> 11:10.754
Uh, kitchen?

11:10.754 --> 11:12.589
All righty.

11:14.550 --> 11:16.176
They're exactly what we need.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.345
Oh, well, then I'm shocked they were
available at a moment's notice.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.180
Did you find them
feeding birds in the park?

11:20.180 --> 11:21.265
They're funny.

11:21.265 --> 11:23.141
Every single one of those writers

11:23.141 --> 11:25.769
has been making sitcoms
since before you were born.

11:25.769 --> 11:27.646
That's not a point in their favor.

11:27.646 --> 11:30.107
We don't need a bunch of dinosaurs
in the writers' room.

11:30.107 --> 11:31.024
So funny you say that,

11:31.024 --> 11:33.610
Alan ran the last two seasons
of <i>Dinosaurs</i> on ABC.

11:33.610 --> 11:37.197
Yeah, again, "wrote for giant puppets"
is not the mic drop you think it is.

11:37.197 --> 11:40.158
Trust me, when it's late
and we're tired,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.703
and we're stuck on that
last page of a rewrite,

11:42.703 --> 11:44.246
you are gonna want pros like them.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.915
They can come up with a joke
that gets ya home every time.

11:46.915 --> 11:47.916
They're legends.

11:47.916 --> 11:49.877
And they're hipper than you think.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.088
Hey.
- Nice kids,

11:53.088 --> 11:56.717
but Selma had this great cunt joke,
went over like a fart in <i>schule.</i>

11:57.426 --> 11:59.553
Also, uh, where can I find a fax machine?

12:01.471 --> 12:04.766
Oh, hold up.
We gotta meet the Queen Bree.

12:04.766 --> 12:07.561
Queen Bree Marie Jensen,
and she's single.

12:07.561 --> 12:10.105
Can we, um, can we just tape this later

12:10.105 --> 12:11.857
because, honestly,
I'm feeling really gross right now,

12:11.857 --> 12:12.733
and according to wardrobe,

12:12.733 --> 12:14.484
I look like a cow
if I'm not wearing Spanx.

12:14.484 --> 12:16.486
We're live to 85,000 people.

12:17.654 --> 12:19.489
-  Oh, hi, everyone!
- Hey, yeah.

12:19.489 --> 12:20.782
Hello!

12:20.782 --> 12:23.368
You should show them the bird
that lives in the light grid!

12:23.368 --> 12:25.120
Good call!

12:25.120 --> 12:26.955
How hilarious is she?

12:27.247 --> 12:30.250
Hey, Bree... Uh, Reed, a moment.

12:31.335 --> 12:36.089
I just came from a bullshit meeting at HR
about what happened yesterday.

12:36.089 --> 12:37.132
What happened yesterday?

12:37.132 --> 12:39.301
Sweetheart, you got a hard-on.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.428
Apparently, that's against company policy.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.180
Oh my god, there was a meeting?

12:43.180 --> 12:45.224
Oh my god, this is
the greatest thing ever.

12:45.224 --> 12:48.602
I'm supposed to make you
feel comfortable because,

12:50.646 --> 12:53.106
"The Walt Disney company
is committed to providing

12:53.106 --> 12:56.151
"a safe and secure workplace environment.

12:56.151 --> 12:59.112
"We must all work together
for a better tomorrow.

12:59.112 --> 13:01.615
Walt Disney, where dreams come true."

13:01.615 --> 13:03.367
- All right, great--
- Just to be clear,

13:03.367 --> 13:07.287
Jerry, um, I'm not in trouble for being
so hot that Reed got an erection?

13:07.287 --> 13:08.747
This is on Reed for being a dog

13:08.747 --> 13:10.707
who goes full lipstick
if someone touches him, right?

13:10.707 --> 13:12.709
- No, this is about Reed.

13:12.709 --> 13:14.628
None of the executives made fun of you.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.632
Okay, the only reason this happened
is because I was reacting in character,

13:18.632 --> 13:21.510
as Lawrence, who was
being aroused by his wife, Josie.

13:21.510 --> 13:22.928
No, I don't think that's what it is.

13:22.928 --> 13:25.681
What I think happened is that
you're confused because of our history

13:25.681 --> 13:27.057
and I think you still
have feelings for me.

13:27.057 --> 13:31.687
I do not still have feelings for you.
I am in a committed relationship.

13:31.687 --> 13:35.566
Right, with Nora,
who's a real person in New York City.

13:35.566 --> 13:37.317
Okay, you know what?
Thank you so very much, Jerry,

13:37.317 --> 13:39.945
for bringin' this to my attention
and reading this document.

13:39.945 --> 13:41.405
I have had enough.

13:41.405 --> 13:44.032
Oh, no, there's, there's somethin' else.

13:44.032 --> 13:46.952
Uh, Dennis, where's
the thing and the thing?

13:46.952 --> 13:49.162
- Here you go.
- Wh-What are we doin' now?

13:49.162 --> 13:51.832
- This is called a vajoga.

13:51.832 --> 13:53.208
-  God.

13:53.208 --> 13:57.296
I'm thrilled to announce you place it
between your stuff and her business

13:57.296 --> 13:59.423
as a protective barrier.

13:59.423 --> 14:05.095
Um, Jerry, I don't think you are aware
of just how hard Reed was yesterday.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.222
I don't think that's
gonna be enough protection.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.098
Please kill me.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.350
There's also this modesty sock.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.560
Tell me more.

14:11.560 --> 14:15.230
Well, you lace it around your member

14:15.230 --> 14:18.859
and pull on the strap
until you achieve a snug fit.

14:20.903 --> 14:23.197
This is fun.

14:23.197 --> 14:25.616
Well, I won't need a vajoga,
and I won't need a sock

14:25.616 --> 14:28.660
because after today,
I may never get hard again.

14:38.921 --> 14:40.797
Hey, naughty man.

14:40.797 --> 14:42.466
I knit you a scarf.

14:42.466 --> 14:44.468
You wanna try it on for size?

14:44.468 --> 14:48.388
Oh, I, I don't know.
I... wouldn't want you to get cold.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.641
Don't worry, I run hot.

14:50.641 --> 14:53.018
Especially since I hit my 50s.

14:53.018 --> 14:58.774
Oh, wow, you know, I, uh,
just came to grab my, uh--

14:58.774 --> 15:00.234
They need me on stage, so.

15:00.234 --> 15:03.737
Ooh, are you tryin' to run away,
my little bunny?

15:03.737 --> 15:06.865
'Cause that would make
Mommy so upset with you.

15:06.865 --> 15:09.117
No, no, no, no.
No need to get upset.

15:09.117 --> 15:10.410
Nobody's trying to run away.

15:10.410 --> 15:13.455
I just, l-literally, have
to get back to the stage

15:13.455 --> 15:14.331
to do my scene.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.625
Oh, what if we shot a little scene?

15:16.625 --> 15:21.505
"Interior me, Clay enters."

15:21.505 --> 15:25.384
Oh, boy, I would really love that, uh,

15:25.384 --> 15:30.222
but they're callin' me,
so, uh... Clay has to exit.

15:36.895 --> 15:40.315
Reed! Hey!
Can I hide in your trailer?

15:40.315 --> 15:41.984
Is this Zack's mom again?

15:41.984 --> 15:44.236
Yeah, he found out,
but he's not even pissed at me,

15:44.236 --> 15:47.573
and now that everyone's okay with it,
uch, it just feels wrong.

15:47.573 --> 15:49.908
So break it off with her.

15:49.908 --> 15:53.620
Well... Zack told me she busted
out some dude's windshield

15:53.620 --> 15:57.249
for trying to cut and run,
and I can't afford that kind of trouble.

15:57.249 --> 15:58.542
Well, I got problems of my own.

15:58.542 --> 16:01.086
Apparently, there was a whole HR meeting

16:01.086 --> 16:05.340
about my totally involuntary
and completely understandable incident.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.634
Your dick caused an HR situation?

16:07.634 --> 16:09.595
- Yeah.
- Interesting.

16:09.595 --> 16:12.973
Now we have to rehearse the scene...
What if it happens again?

16:12.973 --> 16:16.101
Just be a professional
and go crank your hog first.

16:16.101 --> 16:19.229
I'm not gonna pleasure
myself at work, Clay.

16:19.605 --> 16:21.481
That's practically all I do.

16:21.481 --> 16:23.901
Why do you think I never know my lines?

16:26.486 --> 16:29.698
Okay, it's, uh, 3:00

16:29.698 --> 16:33.035
and we are still in the A scene.

16:33.035 --> 16:37.414
That's because it took you guys
an hour to decide where to get lunch.

16:37.414 --> 16:39.708
And then an hour to complain
about the lunch once it got here.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.668
That meatloaf is, is still
not sitting well with me.

16:41.668 --> 16:44.379
-  Oh my god.
- Oh, what, what organ is-is right here?

16:44.379 --> 16:45.464
Please don't die.

16:45.464 --> 16:47.633
Then I'd be the <i>schlockiest</i> writer alive.

16:47.633 --> 16:49.009
What about Murray Klein?

16:49.009 --> 16:52.513
Murray Klein died on a sound stage
just like all his pictures.

16:52.513 --> 16:54.223
- He should rest in peace.

16:54.223 --> 16:56.850
Terrible writer, but a fantastic lay.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.603
Oh, sweet Jesus. Okay, can we,
can we please get back to the story?

16:59.603 --> 17:00.270
All right.

17:00.562 --> 17:02.773
Cody is broke, why is he broke?

17:02.773 --> 17:04.316
Crippling student loans.

17:04.316 --> 17:05.943
Inflation. Gas prices.

17:05.943 --> 17:10.197
He, He lost his job because he
falls asleep whenever he hears a bell.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.615
- Ha!

17:11.615 --> 17:12.658
What?

17:12.658 --> 17:15.202
What do you mean "what?"
Obviously, he's been hypnotized.

17:15.202 --> 17:16.078
Thank you.

17:16.078 --> 17:17.329
When I was on the <i>Lampoon--</i>

17:17.329 --> 17:18.622
Okay, that's four.

17:18.622 --> 17:19.748
I count five.

17:20.123 --> 17:23.001
What, what about, um, crypto or an NFT?

17:23.001 --> 17:25.087
What the hell is an NFT?

17:25.087 --> 17:27.548
What if Cody loses
his shirt playin' the ponies?

17:27.548 --> 17:31.218
So, he's addicted to gambling
and he supports animal abuse.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.303
I thought gay people
were supposed to be fun.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.685
I'm gonna order you some
of those boxer briefs in fun colors.

17:39.685 --> 17:41.395
Ooh, thank you.

17:41.395 --> 17:44.106
I like it 'cause you don't see
a panty line on TV.

17:44.106 --> 17:45.899
- Yeah.

17:46.191 --> 17:48.986
Hey, guys.
We got a little situation here.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.822
This dude's from corporate HR.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.576
Hi, I'm, uh, Tony Fingerton.

17:55.576 --> 17:57.911
Well, hello, Mr. Fingerton.

17:57.911 --> 18:00.747
May I offer you some grapes or a Go-Gurt?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.166
Oh, yeah, uh, sure.
Uh, both would be--

18:03.166 --> 18:05.544
No. We're not gonna give
this creep anything.

18:05.544 --> 18:07.546
Wait 'til you hear what he has to say.

18:08.213 --> 18:09.214
Fine.

18:09.673 --> 18:14.678
Uh, uh, we've, uh, received word
of, um, unreported on-set romance,

18:14.678 --> 18:16.680
which goes against, um,

18:17.431 --> 18:21.393
s-- uh, section four
of the employee conduct handbook.

18:21.643 --> 18:23.061
But she's not even an employee.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.772
- W-- Uh, well, um--
- That's what I said,

18:25.772 --> 18:28.483
but he said it's a problem
because you were a minor

18:28.483 --> 18:29.985
when your mom and I originally met.

18:29.985 --> 18:33.280
Correct. I-I-I'm sorry,
but if you don't end the relationship,

18:33.280 --> 18:36.033
we will find Mr. Barber
in violation of his contract

18:36.033 --> 18:38.327
and he will be terminated immediately.

18:38.702 --> 18:41.163
- Oh my.
- What?! That's B.S.!

18:41.163 --> 18:42.748
Language.

18:42.748 --> 18:44.583
Aw, man, bro.

18:45.876 --> 18:48.295
You've got a tough decision to make.

18:48.504 --> 18:49.922
Okay.

18:49.922 --> 18:53.467
Do we dare try the kiss
at the top for real this time?

18:54.009 --> 18:54.885
I don't know, Jerry,

18:54.885 --> 18:59.473
I would hate to see Reed punch a hole
in a perfectly good vajoga.

18:59.473 --> 19:01.183
Yeah, yeah, yeah. We can do the kiss.

19:01.183 --> 19:03.227
Are you sure you can handle it?

19:03.227 --> 19:04.186
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

19:04.186 --> 19:05.020
- Yeah.
- Okay.

19:05.020 --> 19:08.190
Okay, I am an artist,
and I have control of my instrument.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.609
As long as I don't feel
your instrument on my leg.

19:10.609 --> 19:12.861
All right, people, settle,

19:12.861 --> 19:17.241
and may god have mercy
on our souls, action.

19:17.241 --> 19:20.619
- Finally, have the house to ourselves.
- Mm-hm.

19:34.633 --> 19:35.634
Bree?

19:37.845 --> 19:39.263
Are you crying?

19:42.182 --> 19:46.436
Wait, are you okay?
- No, I just--

19:46.436 --> 19:48.105
Wait, Bree, are you okay?

19:50.774 --> 19:52.109
What'd you do this time?

19:52.109 --> 19:55.904
That was not my fault,
completely flaccid over here!

20:01.827 --> 20:02.828
Hello.

20:02.828 --> 20:06.039
Look, I am so upset
about this whole HR situation,

20:06.039 --> 20:08.000
but you know the rules--
- Stop it.

20:08.000 --> 20:12.713
I knew the whole thing was fake the minute
"Mr. Fingerton" opened his mouth.

20:12.713 --> 20:15.132
- What?
- Clay.

20:15.132 --> 20:18.385
- Okay, Susan, hold on. Don't get mad. I--
- I'm not mad,

20:18.385 --> 20:21.263
but I am very disappointed.

20:21.263 --> 20:23.182
Oh my god, that's so much worse.

20:23.724 --> 20:25.350
Look, it's not what you think.
I can explain,

20:25.350 --> 20:28.103
so there's no reason to start freakin' out
and smashing windshields--

20:28.103 --> 20:28.937
What?!

20:29.813 --> 20:31.690
Wait, is that what Zack told you?

20:33.108 --> 20:34.651
Oh, I see what's happening here.

20:34.651 --> 20:37.821
Can I be vulgar for a moment?

20:37.821 --> 20:38.947
You're askin' me?

20:40.532 --> 20:43.744
I like... to fuck.

20:44.536 --> 20:46.788
And that's not easy for a son
to understand about his mother,

20:46.788 --> 20:49.666
especially after a divorce.

20:49.666 --> 20:55.297
I broke that windshield
from inside the car... with my foot

20:55.964 --> 20:58.091
while having an orgasm.

20:58.717 --> 21:00.761
The neighbors heard and called the police.

21:00.761 --> 21:03.597
Jesus, that's actually impressive.

21:03.597 --> 21:05.098
I owe it all to kettlebells.

21:05.098 --> 21:09.520
So, you're not mad that
I don't wanna have a relationship?

21:09.520 --> 21:11.563
I was married for 25 years.

21:11.563 --> 21:15.400
I only go after men who have
nothing to offer me romantically.

21:16.068 --> 21:20.072
Rough trade boys like yourself
are... kind of my thing.

21:20.072 --> 21:22.533
Well, being called a rough trade boy

21:22.533 --> 21:25.536
by women like you is,
uh, kind of my thing.

21:25.536 --> 21:27.663
Now that Zack thinks
you'll get fired if we're together,

21:27.663 --> 21:30.916
it's even more forbidden
than it was before.

21:31.333 --> 21:32.167
Hm.

21:32.167 --> 21:34.962
Maybe someday when
you're drunk and misbehaving,

21:34.962 --> 21:37.965
you'll gimme a call
and I'll come and set ya straight.

21:38.715 --> 21:41.718
I'd like that, Susan... I really would.

21:42.094 --> 21:43.929
Take care of yourself, Clayton.

21:46.306 --> 21:47.516
But not too well.

21:54.731 --> 21:56.358
She's a heck of a woman.

21:58.151 --> 22:00.737
I probably would've chosen my career, too.

22:00.737 --> 22:02.531
Well, it was neck and neck.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.533
Thanks for being so cool to my mom.

22:05.367 --> 22:06.451
It was great seeing her happy.

22:06.451 --> 22:08.161
Well, she's a nice lady.

22:08.495 --> 22:10.497
At least you're still my TV dad.

22:12.207 --> 22:16.170
Yeah, well...
see ya tomorrow.

22:16.503 --> 22:17.713
Good night.

22:22.259 --> 22:24.803
Look. Hey, I'm goin' to get
a hamburger after this,

22:24.803 --> 22:27.431
- so if you wanna--
- Seriously?

22:28.056 --> 22:30.142
Shotgun!
- Hey, calm down, separate cars.

22:30.142 --> 22:31.143
Right.

22:32.102 --> 22:33.187
Race ya!

22:36.023 --> 22:40.903
I can't believe I cried in front
of everybody like that today.

22:40.903 --> 22:42.779
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

22:42.779 --> 22:44.489
Why did you and Reed break up?

22:44.489 --> 22:48.952
Oh, we made each other crazy.
In the good way and the bad way.

22:48.952 --> 22:53.373
It was just too intense to last.
Totally the opposite with my ex-husband.

22:53.707 --> 22:55.667
Maybe that's why you ran off with him.

22:55.667 --> 22:58.837
Yeah, I might have over-corrected.

22:58.837 --> 23:00.255
So, today?

23:00.631 --> 23:04.176
I think kissing Reed...
took me back to the years

23:04.176 --> 23:08.847
when someone made
me feel sexy... and loved.

23:08.847 --> 23:12.559
And I got overwhelmed
with how long it's been.

23:12.559 --> 23:14.895
Well, not having that
in your marriage must've been awful.

23:15.979 --> 23:19.816
It, It was good in the beginning.
Anders and I had a lot of nice times.

23:19.816 --> 23:23.946
I got to wear a crown,
they named an iceberg after me.

23:25.030 --> 23:27.032
Wait, were they calling me cold?

23:27.741 --> 23:28.825
- Well--
- What?

23:28.825 --> 23:30.035
if it makes you feel any better,

23:30.035 --> 23:31.870
half of the guys
on the crew wanna bang you.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.706
Oh my god! No, they don't.

23:34.706 --> 23:36.375
Do they?
- Yeah.

23:36.375 --> 23:38.418
Even the cute grip who looks like Jesus?

23:38.418 --> 23:41.129
You are an 11 out of 10.

23:41.129 --> 23:42.798
If you were feeling yourself,
you could take anybody

23:42.798 --> 23:44.842
in this bar home tonight.

23:44.842 --> 23:48.011
I think that is what you need
to get yourself right again.

23:48.554 --> 23:50.097
- Maybe you're right.
- Mm-hm.

23:50.097 --> 23:54.476
- Maybe I need to have hot, crazy,
meaningless sex with a stranger--
- Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

23:54.476 --> 23:57.312
- no strings attached--
- Hello, ladies.

23:57.312 --> 23:59.147
Couldn't help overhearing--
Nope.

23:59.147 --> 24:00.148
O-kay.

24:13.954 --> 24:15.414
Can you not do that, please?

24:15.414 --> 24:16.707
You want me to throw 'em on the floor?

24:16.707 --> 24:18.292
That's where your nuts usually are.

24:18.625 --> 24:21.420
I don't love how much
you talk about Alan's genitals.

24:21.420 --> 24:23.463
I'm sorry. Low-hangin' fruit.

24:23.463 --> 24:24.673
How does she do it?

24:24.673 --> 24:26.466
Okay, can we please
get back to the story?

24:26.466 --> 24:29.511
Okay? Anybody, Josie and Whitney?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.096
All right, Josie and Whitney.

24:32.806 --> 24:36.185
Were we too quick to dismiss
the hot, clumsy delivery guy?

24:36.185 --> 24:38.395
- No.
- No. You've got to stop pitching that.

24:38.395 --> 24:41.023
- I'm telling you, it'd work.
- It's too sitcom-y.

24:41.023 --> 24:42.816
- It's funny.
- None of us laughed.

24:42.816 --> 24:45.819
You know, between us, we have
150 years in this business

24:45.819 --> 24:48.947
and you guys haven't laughed at anything
coming from this side of the table.

24:48.947 --> 24:51.533
I don't know, I laughed at some
of the sounds coming out of Alan.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.286
Story of my life.
I love onions, they don't love me.

24:54.286 --> 24:57.289
I'm telling you, it could be
symptoms of something serious.

24:57.289 --> 25:00.125
Uh, I'm sorry, I, I just
think some of the jokes

25:00.125 --> 25:03.712
you guys tell are a, a little c-corny.

25:03.712 --> 25:06.173
Yeah, and a lot of them
are wildly offensive.

25:06.173 --> 25:08.550
They're like the ones
my memaw tells at Thanksgiving.

25:08.550 --> 25:11.178
She sounds funny.
Does she have a [inaudible].

25:11.178 --> 25:12.846
Okay, yeah, I'm gonna
just state the obvious.

25:12.846 --> 25:15.516
So, we're coming from two
entirely different planets here.

25:15.516 --> 25:19.102
Listen, sometimes it takes a while
for a room to come together.

25:19.102 --> 25:20.729
We're never gonna come together.

25:20.729 --> 25:22.564
Selma! Don't even.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.650
Gimme four dildos and a metronome.

25:24.650 --> 25:26.902
You are a broken woman.

25:26.902 --> 25:30.322
Gordon, your writers and my writers
have nothing in common.

25:30.322 --> 25:32.366
So, don't you think that
says something about us?

25:32.366 --> 25:35.160
Says I know how to hire writers,
nothing personal.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.537
Seems personal.

25:36.537 --> 25:39.957
You know... we've barely spoken
for the last 25 years,

25:39.957 --> 25:43.001
so I think we were fucking crazy
to think this could work.

25:43.001 --> 25:45.295
Maybe this is not the place
for that conversation.

25:45.295 --> 25:49.299
Or maybe there's just
nothing left to discuss... Yeah.

25:51.260 --> 25:53.470
- Where you going?
- Guys, I'm, I-I'm really sorry

25:53.470 --> 25:55.013
I dragged you all into this, truly I am.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.557
Gordon, you know what?
You said this is your show,

25:56.557 --> 25:58.058
so do it your way.

25:58.433 --> 26:00.060
What, you're quitting?
Not much use in a room

26:00.060 --> 26:03.647
full of people who can't agree
on a single goddamn thing that's funny.

26:03.647 --> 26:06.483
Ah! [grunts] Ow, fuck me.

26:09.611 --> 26:12.489
Don't laugh, you guys are assholes.

26:12.489 --> 26:15.409
- Oh, my baby, are you okay?
- No.

26:15.409 --> 26:17.661
I'm talking to the garbage can.

26:21.290 --> 26:24.501
I don't know why I'm laughing?
I'm in so much pain.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.752
Wait, wait, wait!

26:25.752 --> 26:28.297
Josie should eat it like that
in the kitchen scene.

26:28.297 --> 26:29.506
- Ooh, absolutely!
- Yeah!

26:29.506 --> 26:33.051
Especially if she just finished giving
some big, melodramatic speech.

26:33.051 --> 26:34.887
And then she trips over an extension cord

26:34.887 --> 26:38.599
'cause Cody's got his computer plugged in
and he's workin' on one of those NFTs.

26:38.599 --> 26:40.642
- Okay, Alan, I see you.
- Yes!

26:40.642 --> 26:43.604
I still don't know what it is,
but I like that somebody's falling.

26:43.604 --> 26:47.608
Falling is always funny.
Yes. Falling's funny.

26:51.236 --> 26:52.070
All right.

26:52.070 --> 26:55.866
Well, uh, we should
probably order some dinner.

26:55.866 --> 26:57.951
Yes, how 'bout a nice
deli platter from Nate 'n Al's?

26:57.951 --> 27:00.204
- Ooh.
- I do like their salami.

27:00.204 --> 27:04.124
- I bet you do, you old whore.
-  You are fun.

27:04.124 --> 27:07.127
You know about salami, huh?

27:18.305 --> 27:19.723
- Hello?
- Hey.

27:20.182 --> 27:24.394
I tried to catch up with you today,
but they said that you took off.

27:25.145 --> 27:29.608
Just, uh, wanted to check in
in a, in a totally non-condescending way.

27:29.608 --> 27:32.861
I'm doing better, thanks.

27:32.861 --> 27:34.696
Good... Very good.

27:35.364 --> 27:39.368
I also wanted to, uh,
let you know that you were right.

27:40.035 --> 27:44.122
Um... deep down, I was worried about,

27:44.122 --> 27:46.750
you know, whether I was gonna
feel that old spark again

27:46.750 --> 27:48.669
ever since I heard
the show was coming back,

27:48.669 --> 27:51.088
and, obviously, I still felt it,

27:51.088 --> 27:55.133
and... uh, you literally did as well.

27:55.133 --> 28:00.764
But [clears throat] I... just, uh,
I just, uh, had a sense today that,

28:00.764 --> 28:03.559
uh, maybe you felt something too.

28:03.559 --> 28:05.769
So, you know, if you
wanted to talk about it.

28:05.769 --> 28:06.645
You know what?

28:07.104 --> 28:08.438
I appreciate you saying that,

28:08.438 --> 28:10.858
but I'm actually in a really
good place right now.

28:10.858 --> 28:11.692
Oh.

28:12.776 --> 28:13.610
Okay.

28:14.194 --> 28:15.404
Glad to hear it.

28:16.154 --> 28:18.156
Yeah... Good night, Reed.

28:19.992 --> 28:21.201
Good night?

28:23.787 --> 28:25.455
Everything okay?

28:25.455 --> 28:26.915
Everything's great.
