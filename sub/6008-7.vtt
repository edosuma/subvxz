WEBVTT

00:37.413 --> 00:38.830
MRS HUGHES: Hurry up girls, come on.

00:45.212 --> 00:48.297
Come on, come on,
you should be done here!

00:48.382 --> 00:51.634
They'll be back from the station
any second now.

00:58.016 --> 01:00.685
I haven't had a chance to ask,
how was London?

01:00.769 --> 01:04.689
Oh, much as usual.
Dirty, noisy and quite enjoyable.

01:04.773 --> 01:07.358
There was no need for you
to come back a day early.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.153
I'm perfectly capable
ofgetting the house ready.

01:10.237 --> 01:12.238
Ofcourse you are,
but I like to have the heavy luggage

01:12.322 --> 01:14.574
back and unpacked before they get here.

01:14.658 --> 01:19.162
I suppose... Steady, William. This isn't a race.

01:21.915 --> 01:23.207
Poor lad.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.959
But he did see her?

01:25.043 --> 01:27.128
I was worried when I took him
to King's Cross.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.297
Yes, he had time to say goodbye.

01:29.381 --> 01:30.923
How is he now?

01:31.467 --> 01:33.718
Well, you've only got one mother,
haven't you?

01:33.802 --> 01:35.094
Mmm-hmm.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.764
They're here, Mrs Hughes.

01:49.151 --> 01:52.111
Hello, William. It's good to have you back.

01:53.363 --> 01:55.031
What a reliefto be home!

01:55.115 --> 01:58.409
Don't listen when his lordship
pretends not to enjoy the season.

01:58.494 --> 02:00.036
When in Rome...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.704
Will Lady Mary be back soon?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.332
She's staying on with my sister
for a couple ofweeks.

02:04.416 --> 02:08.753
- So Grantham House is closed?
- It will be by the end ofthis week.

02:08.837 --> 02:10.713
Dear Mrs Hughes,

02:10.798 --> 02:13.424
I hope you've had some time to yourself
while we've been away.

02:13.509 --> 02:17.386
I've tackled a fewjobs that get
forgotten about when the house is full.

02:18.305 --> 02:19.847
Any local news?

02:19.932 --> 02:23.434
The main topic here is
the murder ofthe Austrian Archduke.

02:23.519 --> 02:25.061
Here and everywhere else.

02:25.145 --> 02:27.688
I'm afraid we haven't heard the last ofthat.

02:27.773 --> 02:30.191
- And how is William?
- Bearing up.

02:31.068 --> 02:33.569
Poor chap. He has our sympathies.

02:34.238 --> 02:36.197
I think I'll wash the train off before dinner.

02:36.323 --> 02:38.366
Very good, milord.
I can unpack while you're bathing.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.992
I'll see you up there.

02:40.077 --> 02:43.538
Oh, Mrs Hughes, have you had any thoughts
about the garden party for the hospital?

02:43.956 --> 02:46.874
I've started on it,
but there are things we need to talk about.

02:47.000 --> 02:51.087
Oh, dear. That sounds like trouble.
I'll take my hat off.

02:52.714 --> 02:57.677
Sybil, you were a great success
in London, darling. Well done.

03:00.430 --> 03:01.973
You never say that to me.

03:02.057 --> 03:06.269
Don't I?
You were very helpful dear. Thank you.

03:08.313 --> 03:11.607
I hate to spoil her ladyship's homecoming,

03:11.692 --> 03:14.819
but what are we going to do
about Mrs Patmore?

03:15.237 --> 03:18.030
She's worse than when you left. Much worse.

03:19.950 --> 03:25.121
Oh, and I meant to ask,
is there a decision about Mr Bates leaving?

03:25.205 --> 03:30.001
Oh, not yet. His lordship wants the facts,
and Mr Bates won't give them.

03:31.336 --> 03:34.922
So, what are you going to say
to her ladyship about Mrs Patmore?

03:35.007 --> 03:37.508
MRS HUGHES: (SIGHS) I'm not sure.

03:37.593 --> 03:43.222
I don't want the poor woman sacked,
but things cannot go on as they are.

03:48.312 --> 03:50.938
ROSAMUND: There's nothing
like an English summer is there?

03:51.023 --> 03:53.399
MARY: Except an English winter.

03:54.568 --> 03:57.653
I'm sorry you haven't received
more invitations.

03:57.738 --> 04:02.199
But then, after four seasons,
one is less a debutante than a survivor.

04:02.868 --> 04:06.162
My dear, is there anything
you're not telling me?

04:06.997 --> 04:10.124
- No.
- Only one hears stories...

04:10.208 --> 04:12.585
There's nothing, Aunt Rosamund.

04:13.879 --> 04:19.926
So, have you decided
whether or not to marry Cousin Matthew?

04:20.385 --> 04:24.180
Oh, there's no secret Cora can keep
for more than a month.

04:24.264 --> 04:26.057
You'd be surprised!

04:26.767 --> 04:30.186
I've told him I'll give him my answer
the day I get back.

04:30.312 --> 04:35.149
Well, it would be very tidy,
at least we can say that.

04:45.369 --> 04:48.537
- Fancy a smoke?
- Don't mind if I do.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.166
There they go. Guy Fawkes and his assistant.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.669
- Which is which?
- Here you are.

04:59.716 --> 05:02.551
Surely, if his lordship
hasn't done anything until now,

05:02.636 --> 05:04.845
it means he doesn't want
to take it any further.

05:06.223 --> 05:09.308
WILLIAM: Anna's made me an armband,
Mr Carson.

05:09.393 --> 05:11.686
For my mother. Can I wear it?

05:12.062 --> 05:15.898
I dare say, not when we're entertaining,
but otherwise.

05:27.202 --> 05:32.832
- Hello, Doctor. I didn't know you were here.
- No, Lady Grantham sent a message.

05:32.916 --> 05:36.502
- Why? She's not ill, is she?
- Not ill, exactly.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.923
Would you mind waiting in the library?

05:44.928 --> 05:46.012
Pregnant?

05:47.097 --> 05:49.598
You needn't be quite so shocked.

05:49.933 --> 05:51.600
Give me a moment.

05:52.436 --> 05:57.273
- You haven't been pregnant for 18 years.
- And I'm pregnant now.

05:57.357 --> 05:59.525
I don't understand
what we've done differently.

05:59.609 --> 06:03.112
Stop right there. Lfyou want to know more,
go down and offer the doctor some whisky.

06:03.405 --> 06:05.197
I can't take it in.

06:05.782 --> 06:07.616
But you're pleased?

06:10.871 --> 06:12.288
Ofcourse.

06:13.957 --> 06:14.957
Ofcourse I'm pleased.

06:18.128 --> 06:19.628
(CHUCKLING)

06:25.135 --> 06:27.219
I didn't think she'd do it.

06:27.304 --> 06:29.138
I told you she would.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.474
I could see she was interested.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.809
And I was speaking
as one lady's maid to another.

06:33.894 --> 06:35.394
That means something, you know.

06:35.479 --> 06:39.607
Course we thought we had him before,
but he's a slippery devil.

06:46.406 --> 06:51.327
- CLARKSON: It's unusual, obviously.
- Unusual? It's Biblical.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.579
(CHUCKLES) Not quite.

06:54.790 --> 06:58.417
You understand that women
go through a certain change.

06:59.294 --> 07:02.171
Thank you. I know quite as much
as I need to about all that.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.840
Well, sometimes it can result

07:05.759 --> 07:09.929
in a surge offertility,
for want of a better word.

07:10.013 --> 07:12.973
- But the child will be healthy?
- Oh, there's no reason why not.

07:13.892 --> 07:15.351
How long has she...

07:15.644 --> 07:19.688
Hard to be precise.
Things had become irregular, but...

07:20.148 --> 07:21.357
Please!

07:21.483 --> 07:25.528
I'd say she's about four months gone.
It'll begin to show soon.

07:26.571 --> 07:29.657
And I don't suppose
there's any way of knowing if it's a...

07:33.703 --> 07:36.539
I do beg your pardon, milord.
I thought you were alone.

07:36.748 --> 07:40.000
No, please come in, Mrs Hughes.
I'm just leaving.

07:40.085 --> 07:41.127
MRS HUGHES: William!

07:41.211 --> 07:44.338
Well, thank you, Doctor.
I'd better start writing some letters.

07:45.006 --> 07:47.049
Show Dr Clarkson out.

07:53.723 --> 07:56.392
I didn't want to bother her ladyship,
ifshe's not well...

07:56.518 --> 07:58.227
She's resting, but tell me anyway.

07:59.604 --> 08:01.730
It's Mrs Patmore, milord.

08:02.399 --> 08:05.359
The time has come
when we really have to make a decision.

08:07.696 --> 08:08.737
Hmm.

08:15.579 --> 08:17.288
THOMAS: Now do you believe me?

08:17.414 --> 08:20.875
Careful, Thomas.
Your position is not a strong one.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.837
Don't punish us, Mr Carson.
It's Mr Bates who's wanting here.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.714
Tell me, Mr Carson, do you think it right

08:26.798 --> 08:29.258
a man like that should live and work
at Downton?

08:48.278 --> 08:49.570
(DOOR OPENING)

08:50.447 --> 08:51.989
Mr Napier, milady.

08:52.782 --> 08:56.619
What a surprise!
I'm afraid you've just missed my aunt.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.831
(CHUCKLES) I know. I watched her leave.

09:02.125 --> 09:04.919
How are your wedding plans going?

09:05.003 --> 09:08.797
Not very well.
In fact, we've decided to call it off.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.591
Really?

09:11.176 --> 09:13.636
Well, it seemed quite fixed at Sybil's ball.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.347
What a shame!

09:16.806 --> 09:17.848
Please.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.187
It'll be better in the long run.

09:23.313 --> 09:24.313
Perhaps.

09:24.856 --> 09:27.149
I know what high hopes
you have ofthe institution.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.987
The thing is, Lady Mary,

09:32.113 --> 09:34.073
I am here today because
I needed to tell you something,

09:34.157 --> 09:36.992
face to face, before you went to the country.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.496
"Face to face"? Gracious me!

09:40.622 --> 09:45.167
I've recently heard gossip about the time
when I came to Downton with Kemal Pamuk.

09:46.294 --> 09:49.880
Gossip that I believe
has made life difficult for you.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.885
I've also heard it said
that I am the source ofthese stories.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.432
It is very important to me
that you should know that I am not.

10:02.352 --> 10:06.313
From that day to this,
I have never spoken one word on the matter.

10:06.398 --> 10:07.898
Then who did?

10:08.942 --> 10:12.027
It seems to have come
from the Turkish Embassy,

10:12.112 --> 10:15.614
from the Ambassador himself, in fact,
and his wife.

10:16.366 --> 10:19.118
But who told them, if not you?

10:20.120 --> 10:22.037
This is the hard part.

10:23.373 --> 10:26.041
When I discovered the answer,
I debated whether I should relay it,

10:26.126 --> 10:28.085
but in the end I feel you ought to know.

10:28.586 --> 10:30.754
The suspense is killing me.

10:33.758 --> 10:37.219
It was your sister, Lady Edith,
who wrote to the Ambassador.

10:37.304 --> 10:39.930
That is why people accept the story.

10:41.933 --> 10:43.058
Edith?

10:43.893 --> 10:45.936
It is very hard to believe.

10:48.315 --> 10:50.316
Harder for you than for me.

10:56.906 --> 11:00.451
I love the thought of a baby in the house,
but if it's a boy...

11:00.577 --> 11:02.828
It'll be very hard on Mr Crawley.

11:02.912 --> 11:04.538
I know.

11:04.622 --> 11:07.708
I was no great champion
when he first arrived,

11:07.792 --> 11:11.754
but it seems to me he's tried his best,
and he's done the decent thing.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.506
I can't see that coming off.

11:15.425 --> 11:20.554
- You don't mean the engagement?
- But it's not an engagement yet, is it?

11:20.638 --> 11:22.431
She'd never throw him over!

11:24.434 --> 11:28.270
Mr Carson, Lady Mary Crawley
does not deserve you.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.158
COUNTESS: And she's not
been in touch with Cousin Matthew?

11:41.284 --> 11:43.118
CORA: Not that I've heard.

11:44.037 --> 11:46.163
Wonderful news, ofcourse.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.290
You must look after yourself.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.502
Don't worry.
O'Brien has me wrapped in silk and feathers.

11:52.379 --> 11:54.088
You're lucky.

11:54.172 --> 11:58.509
I have a horrible feeling
Simmons is about to hand in her notice.

11:59.052 --> 12:05.140
She's looking very fidgety, lately,
and I saw her hurrying to meet the postman.

12:05.517 --> 12:07.643
Oh, you poor thing.

12:07.727 --> 12:10.896
Is there anything worse
than losing one's maid?

12:11.481 --> 12:14.691
I mean, why would she want to leave me?

12:14.818 --> 12:16.735
I've been as gentle as a lamb.

12:19.572 --> 12:21.323
Most ofthe time.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.790
ROBERT: I want to say
I'll make provision for you,

12:29.874 --> 12:32.209
if it's a boy and you get pushed out.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.670
Don't worry, I know you can't.

12:35.755 --> 12:39.925
If any man living understands
the strength ofthe entail, it's me.

12:40.009 --> 12:43.595
I can give you Crawley House for life,
if it's a help.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.932
Have you heard from Mary?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.725
No. Have you?

12:50.437 --> 12:53.772
By the way, I want to ask a favour.
What's the name ofyour cook?

12:53.857 --> 12:56.358
The one you brought with you
from Manchester?

12:56.443 --> 12:57.776
Mrs Bird.

13:01.197 --> 13:04.366
- I'll get it, Mrs Patmore!
- Oh! Don't fuss me!

13:04.451 --> 13:06.410
WILLIAM: Is that everything?
DAISY: Yeah.

13:06.870 --> 13:09.037
How are you feeling?

13:09.122 --> 13:11.874
Well, most people's parents die before them,
and so they should...

13:11.958 --> 13:13.083
Oh, give it a rest.

13:13.168 --> 13:15.961
Your mother knew how to drag it out,
I'll say that for her.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.796
- What?
- MRS HUGHES: Thomas!

13:17.881 --> 13:19.423
Get up to the servery!

13:19.507 --> 13:23.427
(SHRIEKS) You gave me the wrong cloth! Ow!

13:23.511 --> 13:24.928
Here, sit down, Mrs Patmore.

13:25.013 --> 13:27.598
I can't sit down,
I've got the luncheon to finish!

13:27.682 --> 13:29.975
It was not a suggestion. Sit!

13:31.060 --> 13:33.770
Daisy and I will finish the luncheon.

13:43.031 --> 13:46.158
So he'll give us this house for life, will he?
How generous!

13:46.242 --> 13:48.827
It is generous. He doesn't have to.

13:51.289 --> 13:53.290
But it's made me think.

13:54.417 --> 13:56.710
You must stay here ifyou want,

13:56.794 --> 14:01.715
but I wonder if it mightn't be better all round
if I went back to Manchester.

14:02.467 --> 14:03.967
It may not be a boy.

14:05.220 --> 14:08.055
Really, Mother.
You never approved of it all in the first place.

14:08.139 --> 14:12.351
If it is a boy, you should see it as a release,
not a disappointment.

14:13.895 --> 14:15.979
What does Mary say?

14:18.149 --> 14:19.608
Nothing yet.

14:22.487 --> 14:24.738
You wanted to see Mrs Bird, sir.

14:24.822 --> 14:30.452
Yes, Mrs Bird, Lord Grantham
has rather a favour to ask ofyou.

14:32.205 --> 14:36.041
I'm surprised Lord Grantham
knows that I exist, sir.

14:36.793 --> 14:37.834
(LAUGHS)

14:43.049 --> 14:44.800
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

14:47.470 --> 14:48.971
I'm sorry to disturb you.

14:50.056 --> 14:51.765
Quite all right.

14:51.849 --> 14:56.562
Mr Bates, it's about
your somewhat startling confession.

14:57.397 --> 15:00.691
As you'll have surmised,
his lordship has yet to come to a decision.

15:01.359 --> 15:02.734
His delay is generous.

15:03.278 --> 15:06.530
However, it will be no surprise to you

15:06.614 --> 15:11.326
that Miss O'Brien has been
unwilling to let things drop.

15:12.537 --> 15:16.623
It seems that, when we were in London,
she made a new friend.

15:16.708 --> 15:21.044
A lady's maid in the house of a colonel
in your former regiment.

15:29.721 --> 15:34.266
Please tell me that this account is false,
at least in part.

15:36.060 --> 15:37.644
I wish I could.

15:39.480 --> 15:43.442
- I'll have to show this to his lordship.
- Ofcourse you will.

15:43.651 --> 15:48.238
I do not like to play the part of Pontius Pilate,
but I'm afraid I must.

15:49.240 --> 15:51.700
Lord Grantham will decide what's to be done.

15:56.581 --> 15:57.956
Mr Bates,

15:59.459 --> 16:02.210
I hope you do not feel
that I have treated you unjustly.

16:03.171 --> 16:07.090
On the contrary, Mr Carson,
I am astonished at your kindness.

16:20.730 --> 16:25.651
Of all ofyou, Sybil might
find joy in a cottage, but not you.

16:25.735 --> 16:27.069
We don't know it'll be a boy.

16:27.153 --> 16:30.656
Exactly, so ask Matthew
to wait until the child is born.

16:30.740 --> 16:34.242
If it's a girl you can wed him happily,
and all will be as it was before.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.746
But if I delay, won't he think
I'm only after him for his position?

16:38.915 --> 16:43.460
Besides, I'm not sure I want to put him off,
even without the title.

16:44.712 --> 16:46.755
We get on so well, you know.

16:46.839 --> 16:50.425
And he's terribly clever.
He might end up Lord Chancellor.

16:51.010 --> 16:54.971
And he might not.
Oh, come along, Mary, be sensible.

16:55.056 --> 16:57.557
Can you really see yourself
dawdling your life away

16:57.642 --> 17:00.644
as the wife of a country solicitor?

17:07.944 --> 17:11.196
But why would we ever want
a telephone at Downton, milord?

17:11.280 --> 17:13.323
ROBERT: Well, they have their uses.

17:13.408 --> 17:15.450
You could speak
to the housekeeper in London.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.868
That'd be helpful surely?

17:16.953 --> 17:20.455
I hope I've not failed
in my management ofthe recent move?

17:20.540 --> 17:24.167
Not at all. But the telephone is here now,

17:24.252 --> 17:26.920
and the girls got used to it
when we were in London.

17:27.004 --> 17:30.507
Besides, none of us know
what the next few months will bring.

17:30.591 --> 17:32.551
Because ofthe Archduke's death?

17:32.635 --> 17:37.180
Austria won't get what it wants from Serbia.
And now Russia's starting to rumble.

17:37.265 --> 17:40.142
Well, there's not much we can do about that.

17:40.226 --> 17:46.648
- So, will you take care ofthe telephone man?
- Hmm. Oh, about Mr Bates, milord,

17:47.066 --> 17:50.902
I expect you've had time
to consider the contents ofthat letter?

17:50.987 --> 17:53.655
Yes. But I find it very odd.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.949
Regimental silver?

17:56.033 --> 17:59.244
I could more easily see Bates
as an assassin than a petty pilferer.

17:59.328 --> 18:03.498
I agree, and while the letter
is hard to argue with,

18:03.583 --> 18:07.252
I wouldn't put anything past Thomas
or Miss O'Brien.

18:12.425 --> 18:15.844
- So, what did we miss?
- Nothing much.

18:15.970 --> 18:18.346
Although you'd have had
more invitations than I did.

18:18.473 --> 18:22.851
- Have you thought about Matthew?
- Ofcourse, but Aunt Rosamund...

18:22.935 --> 18:25.604
She's written to me.
I should pay no attention.

18:25.688 --> 18:28.940
But, Granny, she has got a point.
Mary can't be completely naive.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.776
I don't need your help, thank you.

18:30.860 --> 18:34.279
Mary, listen to me, ifyou take Matthew now,

18:34.363 --> 18:39.451
when his whole future is at risk,
he will love you to the end of his days.

18:39.535 --> 18:41.536
Why, Granny, you're a romantic!

18:42.497 --> 18:44.623
I've been called many things, but never that.

18:44.707 --> 18:47.709
And what happens ifthe baby is a boy
and Matthew loses everything?

18:47.835 --> 18:49.544
Mary can always change her mind.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.130
But I can't do that to Matthew.
It's not how we are together.

18:52.215 --> 18:55.717
- COUNTESS: Oh!
- I'm going upstairs to help Anna unpack.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.636
I'll come with you.

19:02.225 --> 19:04.518
Edith, why don't you go, too?

19:08.564 --> 19:11.650
Sir Anthony Strallan
was at Lady Wren's party.

19:12.401 --> 19:13.735
He asked after you.

19:22.578 --> 19:25.497
Is she really serious about him?

19:25.581 --> 19:27.707
Any port in a storm.

19:28.376 --> 19:34.256
By the way, I was right about my maid.
She's leaving, to get married.

19:34.924 --> 19:38.426
- How can she be so selfish?
- I do sympathise.

19:39.095 --> 19:42.764
Robert's always wanting me
to get rid of O'Brien, but I can't face it.

19:42.849 --> 19:47.102
- Anyway, she's so fond of me.
- Well, I thought Simmons was fond of me.

19:47.895 --> 19:49.563
What am I to do?

19:49.939 --> 19:51.773
Why don't I put an advertisement
in The Lady?

19:51.899 --> 19:53.608
It's always the best place to start.

19:54.193 --> 19:59.865
Oh, that's so kind, thank you.
Now, I really must be going.

19:59.949 --> 20:05.871
Now, don't let Mary wait for the baby
before she gives Matthew her answer.

20:05.955 --> 20:08.123
I'm sure it's another girl.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.793
I know those men ofthe moral high ground.

20:12.628 --> 20:16.256
Lfshe won't say, "yes",
when he might be poor,

20:16.716 --> 20:19.634
he won't want her, when he will be rich.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.638
Maybe we should knit something.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.808
Oh, yes, I'm sure they'd love
a pair of bootees knitted by you.

20:26.934 --> 20:30.478
- Or what about a christening mug?
- They can buy their own silver.

20:30.605 --> 20:31.813
Anything in the paper, Thomas?

20:32.064 --> 20:34.900
They've arrested this Princip fellow
and his gang.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.402
All Serbian and members ofthe Black Hand.

20:37.486 --> 20:39.988
"The Black Hand"?
Oh, I don't like the sound ofthat.

20:40.281 --> 20:42.991
I don't like the sound of any of it.
War is on the way.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.492
Then we'll have to face it,

20:44.619 --> 20:47.329
- as bravely as we can.
- Thank you, Mr Cannon Fodder.

20:47.830 --> 20:49.247
Don't you think a war's coming?

20:49.332 --> 20:52.459
Oh, there'll be a war, all right.
And it's time to prepare for it.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.629
- The country, do you mean?
- No, me.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.881
You never disappoint.

20:59.050 --> 21:04.262
Daisy, run and find Mrs Patmore.
His lordship wants to see her in the library.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.848
His lordship wants Mrs Patmore
to go up to the library?

21:07.516 --> 21:11.353
That is what I said.
And Anna, you're to come, too.

21:15.358 --> 21:19.402
And we thought the assassination
of an Archduke was a surprise.

21:24.075 --> 21:25.909
Mrs Patmore, milord.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.711
Your lordship, I know things
haven't been quite right for a while,

21:36.837 --> 21:38.922
- but I can assure you...
- Come in, Mrs Patmore.

21:41.717 --> 21:45.261
I promise you, milord,
if I could just be allowed a bit more time...

21:45.388 --> 21:48.390
Mrs Patmore, I have not asked you here
to give you your notice.

21:49.600 --> 21:51.226
- Haven't you?
- No.

21:51.352 --> 21:53.520
I understand you've had
some trouble with your sight...

21:53.604 --> 21:56.022
That's just it!
I know I could manage better ifonly...

21:56.107 --> 21:59.359
- Please, Mrs Patmore!
- Let him speak!

22:00.194 --> 22:02.112
- Beg pardon, milord.
- Don't apologise.

22:02.238 --> 22:05.240
Now, on Dr Clarkson's recommendation,
I'm sending you up to London

22:05.366 --> 22:07.450
to see an eye specialist at Moorfields.

22:08.369 --> 22:10.870
Anna will go with you
and you'll stay with my sister Rosamund,

22:10.955 --> 22:13.581
in her new house in Belgrave Square.

22:14.458 --> 22:17.502
I'm afraid I'm going to have to sit
in your presence, milord.

22:17.586 --> 22:18.962
Ofcourse.

22:22.133 --> 22:24.426
(STAMMERING)
But how will you get on here?

22:26.262 --> 22:30.932
Well, Mrs Crawley is lending us
her cook, Mrs Bird.

22:31.308 --> 22:32.350
She's coming over tomorrow.

22:32.435 --> 22:35.103
You'll be good enough
to show her how things work.

22:35.229 --> 22:37.272
Are the Crawleys to starve while I'm away?

22:38.315 --> 22:40.066
They'll eat here every evening.

22:40.151 --> 22:44.237
Now, my sister's butler will look after you.
He's very nice.

22:44.321 --> 22:46.364
Anna, you won't mind a visit to London?

22:46.449 --> 22:50.160
No, milord. Thank you. It'll be an adventure.

22:50.953 --> 22:53.329
One with a happy ending, I hope.

22:57.126 --> 22:58.460
Cor.

23:03.632 --> 23:06.217
Let me get this clear, at Sybil's ball
you said you'd give me your answer

23:06.302 --> 23:08.011
the day you got back,
and now you say you will not!

23:08.137 --> 23:11.848
Why do we have to rush into it?
I need to be sure, that's all.

23:12.141 --> 23:13.850
But you were sure.

23:14.351 --> 23:15.727
Shall I tell you what I think has altered you?

23:15.811 --> 23:17.562
My prospects!
Because nothing else has changed!

23:17.646 --> 23:18.813
- No.
- Yes!

23:18.939 --> 23:21.107
Lfyour mother's child is a boy,
then he's the heir

23:21.192 --> 23:23.777
and I go back to living on my wits,
and you'd rather not follow me there!

23:23.861 --> 23:27.322
Oh, Matthew, you always
make everything so black and white.

23:27.865 --> 23:29.949
I think this is black and white.

23:30.034 --> 23:32.160
Do you love me enough
to spend your life with me?

23:33.037 --> 23:35.163
Lfyou don't, then say no.

23:36.082 --> 23:38.416
- Lfyou do, then say yes.
- I want to...

23:39.835 --> 23:44.506
Granny told me I should say yes now,
then withdraw ifyou lost everything.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.595
To make that work,
you'd have to be a good liar.

23:51.514 --> 23:53.389
Are you a good liar?

23:54.100 --> 23:56.684
Well, not good enough to try it, apparently.

24:01.190 --> 24:05.610
How could you not have realised
they'd discover the loss at once?

24:05.694 --> 24:08.071
And to keep them in your house...

24:09.573 --> 24:12.826
- But you only served two years?
- That's right, milord.

24:12.910 --> 24:17.038
So, clearly the judge thought
there was some mitigating factor.

24:18.207 --> 24:20.583
I just want to know the truth.

24:21.544 --> 24:24.003
I cannot speak of it, milord.

24:24.088 --> 24:29.050
You must decide whether I stay or go
on the basis ofthe evidence before you.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.969
I will respect that.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.435
I'm sorry. I don't believe it.

24:40.229 --> 24:43.273
How can you say that,
when I've confessed to the crime?

24:44.900 --> 24:48.194
Well, his lordship obviously
doesn't think that's all there is to it,

24:48.279 --> 24:49.863
and I don't either.

24:49.947 --> 24:53.241
Anna, are you set for
the 9 o'clock train tomorrow?

24:53.450 --> 24:54.742
All packed and ready.

24:54.827 --> 24:57.912
You'll be met at King's Cross
by Lady Rosamund's chauffeur,

24:57.997 --> 25:02.000
which I think is generous,
but after that you're on your own.

25:02.084 --> 25:03.501
Right, I must get on.

25:03.586 --> 25:06.504
I'm acting referee
for Mrs Patmore and Mrs Bird.

25:06.922 --> 25:08.756
- Best of luck.
- Mmm.

25:14.597 --> 25:16.431
Will you miss me?

25:18.434 --> 25:21.769
Try not to miss me. It'll be good practice.

25:27.443 --> 25:31.154
I expect it'll be hard adjusting to this kitchen,

25:31.280 --> 25:34.407
- after the one you're used to.
- Not to worry.

25:34.491 --> 25:37.660
I'm sure I can have it cleaned up in no time.

25:37.786 --> 25:38.786
Cleaned up?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.080
I'm not criticising.

25:41.165 --> 25:44.709
With your eyesight, it's a wonder
you could see the pots at all.

25:45.628 --> 25:48.421
You have met Daisy and the others?

25:48.505 --> 25:51.966
I have. Though what they all
find to do is a mystery to me.

25:52.343 --> 25:55.178
MRS PATMORE: Are you not
used to managing staff, Mrs Bird?

25:55.304 --> 25:59.224
I'm used to getting it done
with one kitchen maid, Mrs Patmore,

26:00.351 --> 26:05.188
but I suppose in a house like this
you expect to take it easy.

26:07.733 --> 26:10.276
Do you think we should erect a ring
and let them fight it out?

26:10.361 --> 26:13.071
(CHUCKLES) She's all right, Mrs Bird.

26:13.781 --> 26:18.368
She's more of a general than a trooper,
but, you know, you need that in a cook.

26:18.452 --> 26:20.328
Mrs Patmore's the generalissimo.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.704
(LAUGHS)

26:28.879 --> 26:30.672
Well, I'm very sad.

26:32.716 --> 26:37.011
- I thought Mary was made of better stuff.
- Don't speak against her.

26:38.180 --> 26:41.224
Ofcourse, she's taken advice from someone
with false and greedy values.

26:41.308 --> 26:43.226
- Oh, Mother.
- And we don't have to go too far

26:43.310 --> 26:45.144
to know who that is! I've a good mind...

26:45.229 --> 26:49.315
Mother! You are not to go near Cousin Violet,
that is an order.

26:50.192 --> 26:53.027
- Something's not right about it.
- I agree.

26:53.737 --> 26:56.572
Having a silver thief in the house
does not seem right at all,

26:56.657 --> 26:57.991
even if he could walk.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.744
But Carson isn't keen
to get rid of him either,

27:01.829 --> 27:04.414
and he normally comes down
on this sort ofthing like a ton of bricks.

27:04.498 --> 27:05.748
What's his reasoning?

27:06.709 --> 27:09.252
He blames Thomas and O'Brien.

27:09.336 --> 27:11.838
He says they've been working
against Bates since he got here.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.424
So I should sack O'Brien instead?

27:14.508 --> 27:16.342
You'll hear no argument from me.

27:16.427 --> 27:19.178
This should do the trick, milady.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.768
Ten years of my life,
that's what I've given her.

27:25.853 --> 27:27.186
Ten bloody years!

27:27.271 --> 27:30.606
- But did she say she'd sack you?
- It's obviously what he wants.

27:30.691 --> 27:34.193
- So when will they tell you?
- When they've found a replacement.

27:34.278 --> 27:37.822
Heaven forfend she should have to put
a comb through her own hair!

27:37.906 --> 27:40.241
And if I'm going, you won't be far behind.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.660
Oh, so what? Sod 'em.

27:42.745 --> 27:45.204
There's a war coming and war means change.

27:45.289 --> 27:46.998
We should be making plans.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.751
- What are you talking about?
- Well, put it like this.

27:50.210 --> 27:51.502
I don't want to be a footman any more,

27:51.587 --> 27:54.505
but I don't intend to be
killed in battle, neither.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.849
(WHISPERING) I'm not saying poison them.

28:05.267 --> 28:08.561
Just make sure they don't find her food
all that agreeable.

28:08.645 --> 28:12.065
- (WHISPERING) By poisoning it?
- Will you stop that!

28:12.149 --> 28:14.650
You don't want it to taste nice.

28:14.735 --> 28:18.154
I want them to be glad when I get back,
that's all.

28:21.950 --> 28:22.992
(MRS PATMORE SIGHS)

28:23.452 --> 28:27.163
This will be for the family
and the one in my pantry is for the staff,

28:27.247 --> 28:29.374
or, more precisely, me.

28:29.458 --> 28:31.334
We don't normally provide two.

28:31.418 --> 28:33.544
Then perhaps we should find
another supplier.

28:33.629 --> 28:35.713
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hold your horses.

28:35.798 --> 28:39.384
All right, where do you see
this other telephone?

28:39.468 --> 28:41.511
Here, in the outer hall.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.558
Good afternoon, Carson. Is Lady Edith in?

28:47.643 --> 28:50.603
I am! I most certainly am!

28:51.313 --> 28:53.314
- I was just driving past...
- Yes?

28:53.399 --> 28:56.526
...and I thought you might like to come
for a spin, ifyou're not too busy.

28:56.610 --> 28:57.860
Wait till I get my coat!

28:57.945 --> 29:00.113
Is it all right if I make some notes?

29:00.197 --> 29:01.781
I'm so sorry, Mister...

29:02.241 --> 29:06.577
Oh, this is Mr Bromidge, milady.
He's here about the telephone.

29:06.662 --> 29:09.497
Oh, please make your notes,
dear Mr Bromidge.

29:09.581 --> 29:13.042
We're so looking forward to it.
What an exciting business to be in!

29:13.127 --> 29:14.502
You must be expanding every day.

29:14.586 --> 29:18.464
Oh, we are, sir, but that brings its problems.

29:18.549 --> 29:22.427
Training up men for the work,
when many have no aptitude.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.138
I can't even find a secretary
who can keep pace at the moment.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.099
- What?
- It's hard with a new concept.

29:28.183 --> 29:32.270
Too old, and they can't change.
Too young, and they've no experience.

29:32.354 --> 29:35.440
But have you filled the post yet?
Because I knowjust the woman.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.693
Well, she must hurry up.
We'll close the list tomorrow night.

29:38.777 --> 29:41.446
You'll have her application, I promise.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.074
CARSON: Hmm.

29:57.504 --> 29:59.422
This isn't bad at all, is it?

29:59.506 --> 30:03.759
I don't know. No one told me
there'd be an actual operation.

30:04.052 --> 30:05.803
What did you think?

30:05.888 --> 30:09.640
They were just going to make
magic passes over your eyes?

30:10.476 --> 30:15.771
- All right, Mrs Patmore?
- She'll be fine, thank you.

30:16.732 --> 30:19.192
And you've been sent to us
by the Earl of Grantham?

30:19.276 --> 30:20.943
That's right.

30:21.028 --> 30:23.529
Very good. You can leave her now.

30:23.906 --> 30:27.909
We'll keep her in for a week.
You can collect her next Friday.

30:31.705 --> 30:33.789
I'll be in to visit every day.

30:33.874 --> 30:35.541
What about the rest ofthe time?

30:36.168 --> 30:37.627
Don't worry.

30:43.008 --> 30:44.091
(SNIFFLES)

30:49.890 --> 30:51.474
You'll be fine.

31:33.850 --> 31:35.476
Bates, you say?

31:35.894 --> 31:39.814
John Bates. He must have left the army
about eight years ago.

31:41.817 --> 31:43.651
Wait here, please.

31:56.665 --> 32:00.126
- Have you finished the soup?
- I think so, Mrs Bird.

32:00.961 --> 32:03.421
- And the sauce for the fish?
- Yes, Mrs Bird.

32:03.505 --> 32:06.132
Well, then, put them in the warmer.

32:37.372 --> 32:40.124
You don't mean John Bates,
who went to prison for theft?

32:41.001 --> 32:42.043
That's correct.

32:43.211 --> 32:46.881
Well, I know who he is right enough.
That was an odd business.

32:48.216 --> 32:49.717
Why odd?

32:50.385 --> 32:51.802
Never mind.

32:51.887 --> 32:54.972
So, you're his cousin
and you'd like to be in touch?

32:57.059 --> 32:58.809
Very forgiving.

32:58.894 --> 33:01.228
Well, I've got no address for him or his wife,

33:01.355 --> 33:04.815
but I have got one for his mother
which should still be good.

33:04.900 --> 33:06.692
I've written it down for you.

33:09.905 --> 33:12.073
Thank you for your trouble.

33:25.420 --> 33:29.256
Is it true you wrote
to the Turkish Ambassador about Kemal?

33:29.549 --> 33:32.051
- Who told you?
- Someone who knows that you did.

33:33.428 --> 33:34.762
Then why are you asking?

33:35.263 --> 33:37.932
Because I wanted to give you
one last chance to deny it.

33:39.434 --> 33:41.435
And what if I did?

33:41.561 --> 33:44.605
He had a right to know
how his countryman died,

33:44.690 --> 33:46.065
in the arms of a slut.

33:52.114 --> 33:55.116
How's that advertisement getting on
for the new maid?

33:55.242 --> 33:57.576
Well, it's only just come out.

33:58.787 --> 34:00.371
William and I can manage here now.

34:00.455 --> 34:03.207
Go and tell Mrs Bird
we'll have our dinner in 20 minutes.

34:03.291 --> 34:07.795
Carson, be sure to say to Mrs Bird
the dinner was really delicious.

34:11.967 --> 34:13.926
SYBIL: Oh, thank you.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.764
So, how was the drive?

34:19.099 --> 34:22.351
It was lovely. Only...

34:23.979 --> 34:25.020
Yes?

34:26.815 --> 34:30.359
Well, he said he had a question for me.

34:31.278 --> 34:36.282
He told me he'd ask it at the garden party,
and he hopes I'll say yes.

34:39.661 --> 34:43.289
You must think very carefully
what your answer will be.

34:43.540 --> 34:46.834
Yes, I should think very carefully
about a lot ofthings.

34:49.129 --> 34:52.173
- Do your neighbours have one?
- Yes, they do, in London anyway.

34:52.299 --> 34:54.049
MATTHEW: It seems very wise
to get a telephone now.

34:54.176 --> 34:57.052
Lfthere is a war, it may be very hard
to have one installed in a private house.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.471
Well, let me show you
where we're going to put it.

34:58.555 --> 34:59.805
Ah!

34:59.890 --> 35:02.475
First electricity, now telephones.

35:02.976 --> 35:07.354
Sometimes I feel as if I were living
in an H.G. Wells' novel.

35:07.856 --> 35:09.356
(DOOR CLOSES)

35:09.649 --> 35:13.319
But the young are all so calm about change,
aren't they?

35:14.070 --> 35:17.698
Look at Matthew, I do admire him.

35:18.533 --> 35:19.742
Do you?

35:22.913 --> 35:25.831
- What have I done wrong now?
- Oh, please.

35:25.916 --> 35:30.252
Don't pretend Mary's sudden reluctance
can't be traced back to you.

35:30.378 --> 35:33.380
I shall pretend it, I told her to take him.

35:34.216 --> 35:37.885
Your quarrel is with my daughter, Rosamund,
not me.

35:38.887 --> 35:41.847
So, put that in your pipe and smoke it.

(DOOR OPENS)

35:50.857 --> 35:54.902
Mr Molesley, what are you after?

35:55.028 --> 35:57.947
I wanted a word with Mr Carson.
I'm here to have me dinner.

35:58.073 --> 36:00.783
- You don't want much, do you?
- What were you doing?

36:02.744 --> 36:06.872
Mr Carson dropped his wallet in the passage.
I was replacing it.

36:16.091 --> 36:19.468
But everything seemed so settled
between you at Sybil's ball.

36:20.595 --> 36:22.930
Things have changed since then.

36:23.139 --> 36:24.807
Not necessarily.

36:25.475 --> 36:28.102
I don't seem to be much good
at making boys.

36:29.271 --> 36:33.566
Any more than I'm much good
at building my life on shifting sands.

36:35.485 --> 36:38.904
You do know I should be very proud
to have you as my son-in-law,

36:38.989 --> 36:41.073
whatever your prospects.

36:41.658 --> 36:46.078
Unfortunately, sir,
your daughter is more practical than you.

36:51.084 --> 36:54.503
- Will you join us, Mrs Bird?
- I don't mind if I do.

36:54.629 --> 36:57.381
I'm not sure Mrs Patmore would like that,
Mr Carson.

36:57.465 --> 36:59.758
"Cook always eats separate,"
that's what she says.

37:00.468 --> 37:02.678
Not in our house. There's only the four of us.

37:03.638 --> 37:07.182
Well, you're going any minute.
She's advertised for your replacement.

37:07.309 --> 37:09.602
That filthy, ungrateful cow.

37:11.479 --> 37:14.481
Let the kitchen maids have theirs
on their own.

37:14.608 --> 37:15.774
You stay with us.

37:15.859 --> 37:19.028

that the dinner was delicious.

37:19.154 --> 37:20.779

What have you done with this,
you little beggar?

37:44.554 --> 37:47.556

That's why I said it was for upstairs.

37:49.225 --> 37:51.560
Come on, tell us what's in it!

37:52.354 --> 37:55.856
Just water and a bit ofsoap.

38:00.362 --> 38:03.364
And you've put something
in the fish sauce as well?

38:04.908 --> 38:08.369
Only mustard and aniseed.

38:09.079 --> 38:12.289
Why, Daisy?
Why would you do such a thing?

38:12.374 --> 38:13.749
(SOBBING)

38:13.875 --> 38:17.795
Mrs Patmore was worried that
they'd prefer Mrs Bird's cooking,

38:17.879 --> 38:19.421
and they wouldn't want her to come back.

38:19.965 --> 38:23.801
Is that likely? When they've taken
such trouble to get her well?

38:24.302 --> 38:25.719

I suppose.

38:54.457 --> 38:56.667
Well, at least we'd have all been regular.

38:59.754 --> 39:01.171
Carson said you were here.

39:01.256 --> 39:05.134
Ah! Just checking that
everything's being done right, milady.

39:05.260 --> 39:07.094
Only we never heard back.

39:07.178 --> 39:09.763
That is, Miss Dawson
never heard back from you.

39:09.848 --> 39:12.766
- About an interview?
- Ah, yes.

39:12.851 --> 39:15.936
We got the young lady's letter,
but the trouble is,

39:16.021 --> 39:18.772
she didn't have any experience of hard work
that I could tell, so...

39:18.857 --> 39:22.651
- But she's a very hard worker!
- Oh, I couldn't find any proofof it.

39:22.777 --> 39:26.989
And she gave you as a reference
when you don't run a business, milady.

39:27.115 --> 39:29.324
Well, not that I'm aware of.

and tell her to come to the hall, now.

39:33.663 --> 39:35.122
Yes, milady.

39:35.331 --> 39:39.501
The reason Gwen didn't give any more
details is because she works here,

39:39.627 --> 39:41.170
as a housemaid.

39:41.379 --> 39:44.089
(CHUCKLES) Ah!
And you thought that'd put me off?

39:45.675 --> 39:48.886
and has good speeds in typing
and Pitman shorthand.

- Test her.
- I will, if I like the look of her.

39:53.308 --> 39:55.267
Ah! So, young lady.

at a housemaid?

39:58.521 --> 39:59.688
Why, I did, sir.

39:59.814 --> 40:04.526
Well, my mother was a housemaid.
I've got nothing against housemaids.

40:05.028 --> 40:07.946
They know about hard work and long hours,
that's for sure.

40:08.031 --> 40:09.573
I believe so, sir.

All right, well,
is there somewhere we could talk?

She's being interviewed.

40:37.227 --> 40:38.894
I cannot use my library

is in there applying for anotherjob?

about the case against him.

41:04.379 --> 41:07.798
I want to know why
the sergeant thought it was odd.

41:07.966 --> 41:10.092
I want to know what Mr Bates isn't saying.

41:11.553 --> 41:13.971
Because you don't believe him to be guilty?

41:14.055 --> 41:16.056
No, I don't.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.392
I know he's not.

41:19.477 --> 41:23.856
Well, you're right ofcourse.

41:26.192 --> 41:29.820
Then who was it? Who was the thief?

41:31.322 --> 41:33.657
His wife, Vera.

41:36.619 --> 41:39.288

if no one you know has got one?

41:39.914 --> 41:41.748
But they will have. You'll see.

Might I enquire why my pantry
has become a common room?

41:46.504 --> 41:48.213
Sorry, Mr Carson.

41:48.631 --> 41:51.258
But do you know how it works?

41:51.926 --> 41:53.427
Ofcourse I do.

41:53.511 --> 41:55.804
- Will you show us?
- Certainly not!

but a useful and valuable tool.

Now, get back to your work.

42:20.330 --> 42:21.622
(BLOWS)

42:27.503 --> 42:31.924
She worked at the barracks sometimes,
and helping at big dinners and so on.

42:32.550 --> 42:35.802
That night her opportunity came
and she took it.

42:36.930 --> 42:38.805
They knew it was her.

42:39.098 --> 42:41.516
Someone even saw her with a big carryall.

42:41.684 --> 42:42.976
But why did he confess?

42:43.061 --> 42:44.561
(SIGHS WEARILY)

42:44.646 --> 42:50.067
Well, John wasn't the same man
in those days.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.862
The African war had shaken him up
and made him angry.

42:54.447 --> 42:56.198
He'd been wounded.

42:56.491 --> 42:58.951
And he drank a lot more
than was good for him.

43:02.538 --> 43:04.998
- Was he violent?
- No.

43:05.750 --> 43:07.417
No, not violent.

43:08.419 --> 43:11.797
But he could be hard at times,
with a tongue like a razor.

43:12.382 --> 43:16.301
He felt he'd ruined Vera's life, Miss Smith.

43:17.345 --> 43:19.513
- Do you agree with him?
- No.

43:20.098 --> 43:22.933
No, I thought she was a nasty piece ofwork.

43:23.017 --> 43:25.936
But that's why he took the blame.

43:29.107 --> 43:33.360
- Surely, ifeveryone knew he was innocent...
- But he confessed.

43:34.112 --> 43:37.990
There was nothing anybody could do
once he'd confessed.

43:43.788 --> 43:48.208
Could I ask you something, sir? Only,
I get the feeling that a war's on the way.

43:49.127 --> 43:50.294
I'm afraid we all do.

43:50.378 --> 43:53.297
And when it comes,
I want to be really useful to my country.

43:53.381 --> 43:54.423
How heartening!

43:54.507 --> 43:57.759

more useful than what you do?

43:57.844 --> 44:00.595
Bringing people back to health, back to life.

44:01.014 --> 44:02.222
I see.

44:02.724 --> 44:05.767
Well, we are looking for volunteers

44:05.852 --> 44:08.645
to train for the Territorial Force hospitals,
ifthat's what you mean.

44:09.355 --> 44:10.939
It's exactly what I mean.

44:11.065 --> 44:12.941
- Will you not be missed here?
- Maybe.

44:13.026 --> 44:17.112
But we'll all be going, won't we?
The younger men anyway.

44:17.196 --> 44:19.573
As you wish. I'll make enquiries.

44:20.199 --> 44:22.451
Thank you very much, Doctor.

44:25.246 --> 44:29.124
CARSON: Mr Molesley walked in
and there he was, as bold as brass,

44:29.208 --> 44:32.002
taking my wallet out of my change coat.

44:32.920 --> 44:35.922
Mr Molesley would have no reason
to make it up, milord.

44:36.007 --> 44:38.467
He doesn't know Thomas. Why would he lie?

44:39.344 --> 44:43.555
So, Thomas has been caught red-handed.
Well, we knew he was a thief, didn't we?

44:43.639 --> 44:46.266
And now we have unimpeachable proof.

44:47.018 --> 44:50.771
- I'm afraid he has to go.
- Oh, I hate this sort ofthing.

44:51.314 --> 44:53.815
With Lady Grantham's condition
and everything.

44:53.900 --> 44:56.401
Can we at least wait
until after the garden party?

44:56.486 --> 45:00.447
Very well, milord.
But then, I think we must act.

45:05.411 --> 45:08.121
- How long will you wear them?
- A week or so.

45:08.206 --> 45:11.291
But I can see much better already,
even with them on.

45:11.376 --> 45:15.212
Thank heaven!
Now, we need to talk about the garden party.

45:15.797 --> 45:17.756
Mrs Bird and I have made some lists...

45:17.840 --> 45:19.508
(CHUCKLING) Mrs Bird?

45:19.592 --> 45:22.969
Ooh, I think we can manage
without any help from Mrs Bird.

45:23.054 --> 45:24.638
Can you?

45:24.722 --> 45:29.559
Well, ifyou want your garden party to be run
by a Blind Pugh, that's your business.

45:30.853 --> 45:34.731
Mrs Patmore, there's a lot to be done
and you're only just up on your feet.

45:35.274 --> 45:38.527
- We really cannot manage without Mrs Bird.
- Lfyou say so.

45:39.654 --> 45:41.363
Now, I've been checking the stores

45:41.447 --> 45:44.491
and I've ordered what you'll need
for the baking.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.410
That's very kind, Mrs Hughes.

45:46.494 --> 45:50.789
But I believe we should check the stores,
when it's convenient.

45:51.374 --> 45:53.208
Mrs Bird, at Downton Abbey

45:53.292 --> 45:56.044
the housekeeper manages
the store cupboard, but...

45:56.129 --> 46:00.006
I've never not run me own store cupboard
in me life.

46:00.633 --> 46:04.553
Separate the cook from the store cupboard?
Where's the sense in that?

46:04.637 --> 46:07.514
How long have I been saying this, oh, Lord?

46:08.224 --> 46:12.269
We're the ones who cook it.
We should be the ones to order it.

46:12.395 --> 46:17.941
Mrs Bird, I shall be very happy
with your help with the garden party.

46:18.025 --> 46:22.279
I'm sure we can manage it easily,
between the two of us.

46:33.791 --> 46:35.500

46:37.336 --> 46:40.464
Hello, this is Downton Abbey.

46:47.680 --> 46:48.805
Mmm.

46:51.142 --> 46:55.562
Hello, this is Mr Carson,
the butler of Downton Abbey.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.856
To whom am I speaking?

46:57.940 --> 47:01.026
WOMAN: There's no need to shout,
thank you. I'm not deaf.

47:01.110 --> 47:04.529
I'm not shouting! Who are you?

47:04.614 --> 47:06.823
- Mrs Gaunt.
- Oh, Mrs Gaunt.

47:06.908 --> 47:09.910
- What number do you want?
- No, I don't want to place a call.

47:09.994 --> 47:11.786
What were you doing, then?

47:11.871 --> 47:13.663
I was practising my answer.

47:13.748 --> 47:15.332
Sounds stupid to me.

47:15.416 --> 47:19.211
Well, I dare say a lot ofthe things you do
sound stupid to other people!

47:20.171 --> 47:24.716
I've written to your mother.
She's very anxious, naturally.

47:25.259 --> 47:28.011
- She suggested coming over.
- Oh, God.

47:28.095 --> 47:29.554
Well, that's what I thought.

47:29.639 --> 47:33.475
So, I put her off,
told her to come and admire the baby.

47:35.561 --> 47:38.230
- I'll just go and run your ladyship's bath.
- Thank you, O'Brien.

47:38.314 --> 47:41.149
Ooh, have you had any answers
about the position?

47:41.234 --> 47:42.359
Quite a few.

47:47.823 --> 47:49.699
COUNTESS: So, what do they sound like?

47:49.784 --> 47:52.118
CORA: There's one I think
has real possibilities.

47:52.203 --> 47:53.745
She learned to do hair in Paris,

47:53.829 --> 47:55.705
while she was working
for the Ambassadress.

47:55.790 --> 47:58.750
COUNTESS: Oh! Oh, that sounds promising.

47:59.710 --> 48:01.211

48:02.588 --> 48:05.340
- Carson, I've been meaning...
- ANNA: Your lordship.

48:05.424 --> 48:08.051
Oh! Anna, you're back safely, then?

48:08.135 --> 48:10.136
Yes, thank you, milord.

48:11.055 --> 48:13.056
And Mrs Patmore's fighting fit again.

48:13.808 --> 48:15.934
"Fighting fit" is the phrase.

48:16.852 --> 48:19.854
- Is something the matter?
- I wanted to see your lordship because...

48:20.898 --> 48:21.940
Please.

48:25.570 --> 48:28.947
While I was in London,
I learned something about Mr Bates.

48:31.450 --> 48:34.786
- Not bad, I hope.
- No, not bad at all.

48:35.788 --> 48:37.247
I'd have told Mr Carson,

48:37.331 --> 48:39.666
but I thought you might like to hear it
from me first.

48:40.126 --> 48:41.167
Go on.

48:42.378 --> 48:44.546
You see, I went to call on
Mr Bates's mother...

48:50.928 --> 48:57.309
O'Brien, how long do you think
it takes a lady's maid to settle in?

48:59.145 --> 49:02.439
- Depends on the maid, milady.
- Ofcourse it does.

49:04.859 --> 49:06.943
Oops! Sorry.

49:19.332 --> 49:23.043
- The other half's under the bath.
- Never mind. Thank you.

49:25.171 --> 49:26.963
I'll just go and sort out your clothes, milady.

49:27.048 --> 49:28.214
Thank you.

49:44.523 --> 49:47.317

- Lady Mary's with her now.
- Thank you.

50:10.091 --> 50:12.175
I don't suppose you'll want to change.

50:12.259 --> 50:15.261
But is there anything else
I can do to be useful?

I'm sorry. I don't mean to embarrass you.

I'm not embarrassed.
I just wish you could have been spared this.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.406
I know you do.

50:36.367 --> 50:37.784
Thank you.

50:39.912 --> 50:42.539
By the way, Anna's told me
what she learned in London.

50:42.623 --> 50:45.625
Has she? She's not told me.

50:46.877 --> 50:47.961
Oh!

50:49.296 --> 50:52.799
Well, the good news is
you won't be leaving Downton.

51:24.749 --> 51:27.792

- That must have been quite a shock.

Yes. Yes, it was.

51:52.443 --> 51:53.693

There's one we liked the sound of,
who'd been trained in Paris.

59:01.872 --> 59:04.290
Do you know where
she might have put them?

59:05.542 --> 59:07.001
The answers?

59:07.794 --> 59:10.713
Oh, yes, milady. There are only
two or three places they could be.

59:11.048 --> 59:15.718
Oh! Thank you, O'Brien.
You're a treasure. Thank you.

59:21.350 --> 59:24.769
I didn't know a garden party
was a spectator sport.

59:24.853 --> 59:26.979
Pretty, though, isn't it?

59:27.689 --> 59:31.067
Hard to believe the clouds are gathering
on a summer's day like this.

59:31.151 --> 59:36.322
Mr Bates, I know you think I was wrong
to call on your mother.

59:36.406 --> 59:38.241
I don't think that.

59:39.201 --> 59:41.160
She likes you, by the way.

59:42.913 --> 59:44.789
I had to find out the truth.

59:44.873 --> 59:47.750
But you see, you don't know the whole truth,
not even now.

59:47.834 --> 59:50.253
- You know my mother's truth.
- But not your wife's?

59:53.757 --> 59:56.676
- Where is she now?
- I couldn't tell you.

1:00:00.389 --> 1:00:02.223
I'd better get back.

1:00:07.604 --> 1:00:09.730
You're here, Mr Molesley?
I didn't know that.

1:00:09.856 --> 1:00:11.524
Just helping out.

1:00:12.776 --> 1:00:14.443
Nice girl, that Anna.

1:00:15.112 --> 1:00:17.446
Do you know ifshe's got anyone special
in her life?

1:00:18.031 --> 1:00:20.241
I'd like to say she hasn't.

1:00:20.617 --> 1:00:23.703
I would, truly.
But I'm afraid there is someone.

1:00:23.787 --> 1:00:26.539
And do you think he's keen on her?
Or is it worth a go?

1:00:26.623 --> 1:00:31.752
Well, he keeps himselfto himself,
and he's very hard to read at times,

1:00:33.088 --> 1:00:36.799
but I'd say he's keen.
I'd say he's very keen indeed.

1:00:40.053 --> 1:00:44.348
Daisy! I said ices, not iced cakes!

1:00:44.433 --> 1:00:46.600
Now, unclog your ears
and get these to William

1:00:46.727 --> 1:00:48.894
before they turn into soup!

1:00:51.732 --> 1:00:54.900
- But I don't understand, nothing's changed.
- Everything's changed.

1:00:55.235 --> 1:00:58.529
You can't be sure I was going to refuse you,
even if it had been a boy.

1:00:58.613 --> 1:01:01.157
- Because I'm not.
- That's the point.

1:01:01.241 --> 1:01:04.869
I can't be sure.
Ofyou, or of anything, it seems.

1:01:05.579 --> 1:01:07.038
The last few weeks have taught me that.

1:01:07.122 --> 1:01:08.789
But you can't leave Downton.

1:01:09.374 --> 1:01:11.417
I can't stay. Not now.

1:01:12.127 --> 1:01:13.586
Well, what will you tell Papa?

1:01:14.463 --> 1:01:19.342
That I'm grateful for what he's trying to do,
but the experiment is at an end.

1:01:20.427 --> 1:01:23.763
I'm not a puppet.
I must take charge of my own life again.

1:01:25.349 --> 1:01:28.559
Would you have stayed, if I'd accepted you?

1:01:31.480 --> 1:01:32.688
Ofcourse.

1:01:34.608 --> 1:01:37.193
So I've ruined everything?

1:01:37.486 --> 1:01:43.032
You've shown me I've been living in a dream,
and it's time to return to real life.

1:01:45.077 --> 1:01:47.244
Wish me luck with it, Mary.

1:01:47.746 --> 1:01:50.289
God knows I wish the best for you.

1:02:05.138 --> 1:02:06.722
Well, Rosamund.

1:02:07.099 --> 1:02:11.977
I'm afraid your meddling has cost Mary
the only decent offer she'll ever get.

1:02:12.354 --> 1:02:16.315
I'm sorry, Mama, but you know me.
I have to say what I think.

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:19.944
Why? Nobody else does.

1:02:31.081 --> 1:02:33.249
Are you quite well, milady?

1:02:33.458 --> 1:02:36.752
Ofcourse! You know me, Carson.

1:02:38.171 --> 1:02:40.256
I'm never down for long.

1:02:43.844 --> 1:02:45.302
(SOBBING)

1:02:47.597 --> 1:02:49.974
I know you have spirit, milady.

1:02:50.767 --> 1:02:54.562
And that's what counts.
It's all that counts in the end.

1:02:58.859 --> 1:03:00.359
There, there.

1:03:02.237 --> 1:03:06.574
So Mary is to be denied
her countess's coronet after all?

1:03:06.658 --> 1:03:08.117
Don't crow at me.

1:03:08.201 --> 1:03:11.078
I think she was very foolish
not to take him when she could.

1:03:11.163 --> 1:03:12.913
And I told her so.

1:03:12.998 --> 1:03:14.081
Well, if I'm perfectly honest,

1:03:14.166 --> 1:03:17.668
I wonder if Matthew isn't making
the same mistake right now.

1:03:24.426 --> 1:03:26.260
Are you warm enough?

1:03:26.928 --> 1:03:29.430
I am when you're holding my hand.

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:33.434
- Your lordship, this has just arrived for you.
- Thank you.

1:03:33.935 --> 1:03:37.521
Oh, and I'm happy to tell you
that Thomas has just handed in his notice.

1:03:38.231 --> 1:03:41.108
So we'll be spared any unpleasantness
on that score.

1:03:41.651 --> 1:03:43.652
What a relief!

1:03:57.501 --> 1:04:00.336
Please, would you stop, please.

1:04:00.420 --> 1:04:05.090
My lords, ladies and gentlemen,
can I ask for silence?

1:04:08.762 --> 1:04:14.683
Because I very much regret to announce
that we are at war with Germany.
