WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.505
MICHAEL:
Kahlua sombrero, please.

00:03.588 --> 00:04.881
All right.
So just you tonight?

00:05.048 --> 00:08.092
Actually, I'm meeting somebody,
but I'm a little bit early.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.971
Leaving my company
after 19 years.

00:12.305 --> 00:13.431
I'll drink to that.

00:14.474 --> 00:15.850
I'm starting at
a company this week.

00:15.934 --> 00:17.268
Oh, really?

00:17.560 --> 00:18.728
To beginnings and endings.

00:18.811 --> 00:22.982
And to middles. The unsung heroes.
And to moms.

00:23.525 --> 00:24.609
The moms of the troops.

00:24.776 --> 00:25.818
Mmm.

00:26.402 --> 00:28.780
Do not tell my fiancÃ©e
I'm drinking on a Wednesday.

00:28.863 --> 00:30.490
(LAUGHS) I won't.

00:31.157 --> 00:32.366
I don't know her.

00:32.450 --> 00:33.535
Moving out to the 'burbs.

00:33.618 --> 00:36.079
Actually, I'm moving further than
the 'burbs. Moving to Colorado.

00:36.162 --> 00:37.205
Colorado?
Yeah.

00:37.288 --> 00:38.831
Sunshine State.
Yep.

00:38.915 --> 00:39.916
Don't mess with Colorado.

00:39.999 --> 00:41.000
No, don't.

00:41.417 --> 00:42.502
Doing some skiing?

00:42.585 --> 00:44.712
No, no. I don't want to
end up like Sonny Bobo.

00:45.088 --> 00:48.007
Well, that's just good
sense right there, yeah.

00:48.091 --> 00:50.677
Everyone I know
who skis is dead.

00:52.136 --> 00:54.097
You know what? I would like
to try the luge, though.

00:54.180 --> 00:56.224
Try it once, you're hooked.

00:56.307 --> 00:58.184
That's my guess.
That's what I've heard.

00:58.268 --> 00:59.477
I'm an Olympics nut.

00:59.561 --> 01:01.688
Oh, yeah? Me, too.
Summer or winter?

01:02.647 --> 01:04.107
Summer.
Summer.

01:04.816 --> 01:06.359
Knuckle. Actually,

01:06.818 --> 01:08.570
I've got to come around and give you.
. . Yeah, come on.

01:08.653 --> 01:11.406
You know, it's funny.
I actually tried

01:11.489 --> 01:13.575
to get an animal
Olympics going.

01:13.658 --> 01:15.159
Really? What happened?

01:15.868 --> 01:17.829
You know, life happened.

01:18.329 --> 01:20.039
What are you gonna miss
most about Scranton?

01:20.164 --> 01:24.335
Oh. Wow. The mountains,
where things are. Mmm-hmm.

01:25.587 --> 01:26.879
That's the way it goes.

01:27.005 --> 01:29.299
Man, he is late.

01:29.382 --> 01:30.800
I'm gonna call him.
Do you mind? I'm sorry.

01:30.883 --> 01:32.260
No, no.

01:32.343 --> 01:34.012
Where is this guy?

01:35.972 --> 01:37.599
(PHONE VIBRATING)
(CLEARS THROAT)

01:37.932 --> 01:39.267
Excuse me.

01:41.686 --> 01:43.438
Hello?
This is Michael Scott.

01:43.521 --> 01:45.189
Yes, hi.
Yes.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.316
You running late?

01:46.399 --> 01:49.027
No, I'm here.
I'm at the bar.

01:49.110 --> 01:50.111
I'm at the bar, too.

01:50.194 --> 01:52.155
You are? What bar?

01:52.739 --> 01:57.702
I'm at the bar, the bar that's
located in the lobby of the hotel.

01:57.994 --> 01:59.037
I do not see you.

01:59.120 --> 02:00.121
How long have you...

02:00.204 --> 02:03.291
I've been here about, gosh,
over half an hour.

02:03.374 --> 02:04.626
Okay, yeah, me, too.

02:05.001 --> 02:06.753
Sorry.
Sorry.

02:06.878 --> 02:07.920
What are you wearing?

02:08.003 --> 02:10.548
I'm wearing
a gray suit, red tie.

02:10.882 --> 02:12.550
Are we both at
the right place?

02:13.885 --> 02:15.011
Which place would...

02:15.094 --> 02:16.179
I hear your voice.

02:16.262 --> 02:17.680
I hear your...
I see your lips moving.

02:17.764 --> 02:19.057
I hear your voice

02:19.098 --> 02:23.311
in the phone. And that's...
Man! And... Oh, brother.

02:23.728 --> 02:25.146
(BOTH LAUGHING)

02:25.229 --> 02:26.230
Michael Scott.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.315
Deangelo Vickers.

02:27.398 --> 02:28.650
Wow.

02:28.733 --> 02:30.652
That is insane.

02:30.735 --> 02:33.529
"That is insane" is right.
That's the right term.

02:33.613 --> 02:36.366
Bartender, let's get some
vodka up in this cranberry

02:36.449 --> 02:37.825
and one for my friend.

02:37.909 --> 02:41.371
I have heard that it is impossible
to become addicted to vodka.

02:41.454 --> 02:44.624
That is true. That is true.
Vodka is non-addictive.

02:44.916 --> 02:48.378
Most of the higher
spirits are undetectable.

02:48.461 --> 02:49.754
It's because
of the potato.

02:49.921 --> 02:51.339
One, two, three.
...two, three.

02:51.422 --> 02:52.965
To new friends.

02:54.384 --> 02:55.343
Wow.

02:55.426 --> 02:56.511
Wow.
Wow.

02:57.011 --> 02:59.597
This is gonna take hours.

03:01.099 --> 03:02.183
Are her breasts
different?

03:02.266 --> 03:03.226
No panties
on this one.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.519
Okay, good.
Good.

03:04.602 --> 03:06.729
And I think the sail
was folded differently.

03:06.854 --> 03:08.648
Oh! No. No, it's good. That's okay.
That's okay.

03:08.731 --> 03:09.691
It's all good.

03:09.774 --> 03:12.860
On this one, I think
she's like, "Get lost,"

03:12.944 --> 03:14.654
but on this one,
I think I have a chance.

03:14.779 --> 03:15.738
No.
Okay.

03:15.822 --> 03:17.198
Now, I still think
the sail is different.

03:17.365 --> 03:18.533
(EXCLAIMS) Come on.

03:18.616 --> 03:19.659
Hey, I think
this is broken.

03:20.284 --> 03:22.120
Wanna play again?
Definitely!

03:22.578 --> 03:23.788
That right there...

03:23.955 --> 03:25.164
You want to try this.
Trust me.

03:25.248 --> 03:26.290
Really?
Trust me.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.459
You want to try this.

03:28.626 --> 03:29.669
Mmm!

03:29.752 --> 03:31.629
Are you kidding me?
Mmm-hmm!

03:31.879 --> 03:34.674
Because one day, they say that
blueberries prevent cancer,

03:34.757 --> 03:37.093
and then the next day, they say
that blueberries cause cancer.

03:37.176 --> 03:38.886
That's totally true.

03:39.011 --> 03:42.807
You know what would be a great Onion
headline? "Cancer prevents cancer."

03:42.890 --> 03:44.392
(BOTH LAUGHING)

03:50.481 --> 03:52.024
That's so Onion.
I know!

03:52.150 --> 03:54.819
It's so you,
but it's also so Onion.

03:57.029 --> 03:58.197
Here we go. Ready?

03:58.281 --> 03:59.323
I am ready.

03:59.407 --> 04:00.575
All right, here we go.

04:02.744 --> 04:06.164
Well, this is it.
What do you think?

04:07.749 --> 04:11.085
She'll do.
Oh, she'll do just fine.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.712
(CHUCKLES)

04:13.171 --> 04:16.798
I am very much looking forward
to tomorrow. It is...

04:17.884 --> 04:19.927
(SIGHS) It feels like the
culmination of a lot of hard work,

04:20.011 --> 04:21.971
a lot of good fortune and...

04:22.180 --> 04:23.181
(SNICKERS)

04:23.264 --> 04:26.517
(LAUGHS) Hey, come on. Did that.
. . Did that just happen?

04:27.894 --> 04:30.480
We should write a movie or something.
I'm serious.

04:55.463 --> 04:57.548
Rise and shine.
Coffee time.

04:58.382 --> 04:59.383
There you go.

05:00.134 --> 05:01.427
(SIGHS)

05:02.178 --> 05:04.972
Do not talk to me
until I have had my coffee.

05:05.515 --> 05:09.435
Until I've had my coffee,
do not talk to me.

05:13.564 --> 05:14.732
Mmm.

05:16.901 --> 05:18.444
Oh, I feel better.

05:18.528 --> 05:19.821
I feel awesome.

05:19.987 --> 05:21.781
It does not agree
with me,

05:22.490 --> 05:24.450
coffee...
No.

05:24.534 --> 05:25.827
...and yet,
I have to have it.

05:25.910 --> 05:28.496
You know what?
Coffee keeps me regular.

05:28.579 --> 05:30.039
Yeah.

05:32.083 --> 05:34.001
That's the best time of the day.
That's... That's...

05:34.085 --> 05:35.461
In that regard.
Right, right, right.

05:35.545 --> 05:36.587
And it's the best
time of the day.

05:36.671 --> 05:37.713
Right, right, right.

05:39.382 --> 05:41.467
I give it about
seven minutes.

05:42.468 --> 05:43.636
Really.
Yup.

05:43.719 --> 05:45.179
Seven minutes from this.

05:45.805 --> 05:46.806
Beeline.

05:47.306 --> 05:50.476
So at 8:37...

05:54.897 --> 05:57.024
Michael is leaving.

05:57.108 --> 06:00.319
And apparently they already
hired a new manager.

06:00.403 --> 06:03.614
And we're meeting him today.
It's a lot to process.

06:04.866 --> 06:06.576
Paperwork-wise.

06:10.621 --> 06:15.960
Nope, it's not Ashton Kutcher.
It's Kevin Malone.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.171
Equally handsome,
equally smart.

06:21.007 --> 06:22.633
Good morning.
MICHAEL: Good morning.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.971
Good morning. Good
morning, to you.

06:30.975 --> 06:32.518
What's this?

06:32.810 --> 06:35.146
Oh, nothing.
That is just a screenplay.

06:35.229 --> 06:39.483
The Adventure Pals by Deangelo
Vickers and Michael Scott.

06:40.192 --> 06:42.320
Oh, my gosh,
it's 150 pages long.

06:42.820 --> 06:45.406
Okay, everyone,
as you know,

06:45.489 --> 06:49.327
one of my favorite things
is fanfare for its own sake.

06:49.410 --> 06:51.621
So without further ado,

06:51.704 --> 06:53.706
let's all start clapping.

06:56.918 --> 07:01.005
Presenting Deangelo Vickers!

07:02.673 --> 07:04.800
Hi. Hello.

07:06.218 --> 07:07.511
MICHAEL: Come on out!

07:08.971 --> 07:11.974
Hello. Hey.
How are you, sir?

07:12.058 --> 07:13.434
I'm well, sir,
how are you?

07:13.517 --> 07:16.520
Uh, can I just say I am so
excited to be working here.

07:17.146 --> 07:20.024
We couldn't be more excited
about having you here. Welcome.

07:20.149 --> 07:24.278
Little bit about myself, I love the
American southwest, for starters.

07:24.445 --> 07:28.074
You may call them Arizona,
New Mexico, Nevada, Utah.

07:28.366 --> 07:29.450
I call them heaven.

07:29.533 --> 07:32.453
I have a peanut allergy,
something I live with.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.580
It's a part of me. I've
learned to cope with it.

07:34.705 --> 07:38.042
I was a nationally ranked
high jumper in high school.

07:38.376 --> 07:39.585
Really?
Yeah.

07:39.669 --> 07:40.628
I didn't know that.

07:40.711 --> 07:42.630
Couldn't do it in college
for academic reasons,

07:42.880 --> 07:44.924
and that's something
that still bugs me.

07:45.132 --> 07:50.388
What else? I'm just as comfortable
at a ball game as I am at the opera.

07:51.263 --> 07:52.306
I was a...

07:52.390 --> 07:55.309
Did I want to be
made manager? Sure.

07:55.393 --> 07:57.895
A great opportunity
squandered? Absolutely.

07:57.979 --> 08:00.648
A crushing blow? Yes.

08:01.399 --> 08:03.150
Will I get over it?

08:03.234 --> 08:04.276
Mmm...

08:05.236 --> 08:06.612
No.

08:06.696 --> 08:09.407
But life goes on.
Not for me.

08:09.949 --> 08:12.076
I think with
a little hard work,

08:12.868 --> 08:16.038
we can become the greatest
office in the world.

08:17.081 --> 08:20.501
And I truly believe that, that's
not an understatement. Okay?

08:21.252 --> 08:22.253
Right?

08:22.837 --> 08:24.880
Yeah.
Yeah? Yeah? Okay.

08:25.589 --> 08:27.091
That's about it.
That's about it?

08:27.174 --> 08:28.384
Yeah.
There's so much more.

08:28.467 --> 08:30.970
No. This guy is being so modest,

08:31.053 --> 08:34.181
there's a lot more to him
than what he just said.

08:34.265 --> 08:38.102
We can't wait to learn it all, right, guys?
Again, welcome.

08:39.311 --> 08:41.355
Fantastic.
Thank you so much.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.232
Sir?
Yes.

08:43.941 --> 08:45.317
Thank you very much.

08:46.235 --> 08:48.029
So we talked for
like 20 minutes,

08:48.195 --> 08:50.823
no clue it's Deangelo
the whole time.

08:51.115 --> 08:52.283
It's kind of embarrassing.

08:52.366 --> 08:53.492
No, no.

08:53.784 --> 08:55.786
Yeah, that story
makes you sound stupid.

08:55.870 --> 08:59.915
I happen to like the hilarious
high jinks that I get myself into.

09:00.374 --> 09:01.542
There he is, there he is.

09:01.625 --> 09:05.254
Deangelo, I was just telling them
about last night when we met.

09:05.796 --> 09:07.506
Remember that?
(LAUGHS)

09:08.049 --> 09:09.550
That was crazy.
That was crazy.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.094
Let's see,
where's my replacement?

09:13.054 --> 09:14.889
Where's the guy I'm replacing?
I don't know.

09:15.014 --> 09:16.891
Why don't I look to my left?
(LAUGHS) I know.

09:16.974 --> 09:18.434
He's sitting right there.
I know.

09:19.143 --> 09:22.354
Well, that's what I was
just saying. That's...

09:22.980 --> 09:26.275
That exact situation is why I always
carry around a couple of these.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.735
Just in case,
'cause, you know,

09:27.818 --> 09:29.070
sometimes you need
to ID yourself.

09:29.153 --> 09:30.488
(LAUGHING)

09:30.821 --> 09:31.947
Office funny guy.

09:32.490 --> 09:34.867
Always glad to have
an office funny guy around.

09:35.826 --> 09:36.994
AN DY: I wasn't even
trying to make a joke.

09:37.953 --> 09:42.541
I guess I've always been sort of
quirky, offbeat, a little twisted.

09:44.168 --> 09:47.213
This is Jim and Pam,
a. k.a. Jap.

09:47.838 --> 09:51.175
What started as an affair has blossomed
into a family before our eyes.

09:51.258 --> 09:53.094
Well, it wasn't... It wasn't an affair.
Yes, it was.

09:53.177 --> 09:54.804
But, no,
but we are a family.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.138
We made that.

09:56.222 --> 09:57.473
Cecelia.
DEANGELO: Oh!

09:58.182 --> 09:59.892
Congratulations.
Thank you.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.018
I have four kids
of my own.

10:01.102 --> 10:02.144
Really?
Yeah.

10:02.228 --> 10:06.190
Oh, my gosh, well, we just have
the one, but she poops for four.

10:06.524 --> 10:07.483
Uh-oh.

10:07.566 --> 10:10.569
Someone started off on a
good foot with the new boss.

10:10.653 --> 10:13.114
Yeah, they don't ever talk
about careers that were made

10:13.197 --> 10:16.075
because of unplanned
pregnancies. So...

10:16.742 --> 10:20.079
Meredith has shown me her breasts
on three separate occasions.

10:20.162 --> 10:22.039
Really?
There's Dwight. Dwight!

10:22.998 --> 10:25.334
Best right-hand man in the business,
but you better buy a taser

10:25.417 --> 10:26.585
to keep him from
wiping you butt.

10:26.669 --> 10:29.213
Hey, Dwight. You had something
to say to Deangelo?

10:30.714 --> 10:33.759
"Welcome, new manager
of Dunder Mifflin.

10:34.635 --> 10:37.972
"I am Dwight K. Schrute, I am
assistant regional manager.

10:38.389 --> 10:40.558
"I will be at your beck
and call, night and day.

10:40.641 --> 10:45.062
"Consider me an extension of your own hand.
I serve at your pleasure.

10:45.563 --> 10:48.899
"Congratulations on
joining the staff here.

10:48.983 --> 10:50.734
"This truly is a great day."

10:51.610 --> 10:52.611
The end.

10:52.903 --> 10:54.738
Very nice.
Thank you.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.407
I brought you some cookies.

10:56.448 --> 10:58.159
Oh, Dwight's home baked cookies.
Really, you didn't have to.

10:58.242 --> 10:59.827
These are the best. Lemon
bars or the coconut ones?

10:59.910 --> 11:01.453
I got these at the store.

11:01.787 --> 11:05.124
Apparently it's one of the most
popular brands in the United States.

11:06.041 --> 11:07.751
Enjoy.
Chips Ahoy!

11:08.002 --> 11:09.003
Okay.

11:11.255 --> 11:14.008
Maybe he ran out of yeast,
I don't know.

11:14.466 --> 11:17.636
Maybe syrup? No, not... Well,
maybe syrup. I don't know.

11:17.761 --> 11:19.638
But didn't... Oh, sure, sure.
You can use syrup.

11:19.930 --> 11:22.016
That apple looks delish.

11:22.433 --> 11:23.767
I do a lot of
portion control.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.437
Try to keep my daily caloric
intake under 1,200.

11:26.854 --> 11:28.772
Deangelo, you're
going to starve to death.

11:28.856 --> 11:29.857
(DEANGELO LAUGHS)

11:29.940 --> 11:31.692
So you decided to have an orgy
and not invite me?

11:31.775 --> 11:33.235
Come on. I call middle.

11:33.444 --> 11:35.070
(ALL LAUGH)

11:35.279 --> 11:36.989
That's cool that you like
the southwest.

11:37.114 --> 11:38.866
It's one of my
favorite regions.

11:38.949 --> 11:42.953
"It's one of my favorite regions."
Did I just sound totally lame?

11:43.871 --> 11:44.955
Oh.

11:45.873 --> 11:47.333
I sounded good.

11:47.541 --> 11:50.920
I love the desert. It's one
of my favorite ecosystems.

11:51.003 --> 11:53.172
Here's the great thing
about the southwest,

11:53.297 --> 11:55.925
there is so much
more than desert.

11:56.008 --> 11:58.135
Along the north rim
of the Grand Canyon

11:58.302 --> 12:00.471
is a forest as lush
as you've ever seen.

12:00.638 --> 12:02.681
Burned. It's lush, dummy.

12:02.806 --> 12:06.310
Hey, Deangelo, what do you
think about bald people?

12:07.603 --> 12:08.812
I hate them.

12:08.896 --> 12:11.398
Deangelo, I forget, did you
mention you liked politics?

12:11.482 --> 12:12.441
I did not.

12:12.524 --> 12:14.610
Because I was thinking,
you should meet my boyfriend.

12:14.693 --> 12:15.945
He's a state senator.

12:16.028 --> 12:19.406
I really think the two of you would hit
it off. He's a great person to know.

12:19.573 --> 12:21.325
Sounds very interesting,
thank you.

12:21.533 --> 12:22.660
ANGELA: Mmm-hmm.

12:22.993 --> 12:24.620
Psst. Thanks for
meeting me.

12:24.703 --> 12:25.704
Are you kidding?

12:25.829 --> 12:27.581
I would come anywhere
to see a turtle. Yeah.

12:27.665 --> 12:28.749
Where'd you find him?

12:29.500 --> 12:31.252
There's no turtle, Michael. I
just wanted to get you here.

12:31.752 --> 12:32.795
(GROANS)

12:32.878 --> 12:34.255
You know me
very well, Dwight.

12:34.338 --> 12:36.548
That's because I'm your
right-hand man, Michael.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.425
But I can't do it.
I can't do it again.

12:38.509 --> 12:40.302
I can't be a right-hand man
to a whole new guy.

12:40.386 --> 12:43.013
Now, I'm gonna have to go
online and look at turtles

12:43.097 --> 12:44.431
or else I'm gonna
be off the whole day.

12:44.515 --> 12:46.642
I want to be manager.

12:47.351 --> 12:49.270
I have been Robin to your
Batman for 11 years,

12:49.353 --> 12:51.355
11 glorious years, Michael.

12:51.522 --> 12:54.692
But at a certain point,
Robin needs to become Batman.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.611
Batman scares me, Dwight.
Let's not talk about Batman.

12:57.695 --> 13:00.781
Yeah, well, you know what?
Bats scared Bruce Wayne, too.

13:00.864 --> 13:03.617
That's why he became
Batman. Ha!

13:07.371 --> 13:08.622
What are you thinking?

13:08.706 --> 13:09.707
Nothing.

13:10.124 --> 13:11.166
Is there a Turtle Man?

13:11.250 --> 13:12.501
No, Michael... (GROANS)

13:12.793 --> 13:16.880
I just don't understand why I wasn't
even interviewed for the job.

13:17.214 --> 13:18.299
I mean, what's wrong?

13:18.382 --> 13:21.302
I'm totally qualified.
You were pushing for me.

13:21.427 --> 13:24.221
I didn't know Dwight
wanted to be manager.

13:25.014 --> 13:26.473
(SIGHS)

13:28.600 --> 13:31.145
Deangelo. You'll get
a kick out of this.

13:31.228 --> 13:32.646
Do you know those
old school blocks,

13:32.730 --> 13:34.773
the wooden blocks for kids?
Mmm-hmm.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.526
Oh, my gosh, yes. Oh, yeah. The
block story. This is great.

13:37.609 --> 13:38.610
Right.
Okay, go ahead.

13:38.736 --> 13:40.446
So, the blocks with the letters on.
. . With the letters.

13:40.529 --> 13:41.488
Yes, right, okay.
Yeah sure, sure, sure.

13:41.572 --> 13:43.032
So we give a set
of those to Cece

13:43.157 --> 13:44.575
and we turn around for,
like, a second...

13:44.658 --> 13:45.659
A second.
A second.

13:45.743 --> 13:50.497
And we turn back, and she has spelled
out the word "Ass" in the blocks.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.292
So we're laughing,
she's grinning...

13:53.375 --> 13:54.793
It was so funny.

13:54.877 --> 13:58.172
Kids are a riot. They really
do say the darndest things.

13:59.089 --> 14:00.215
(PHONE RINGS)

14:01.216 --> 14:03.802
Dunder Mifflin. This is Erin.
Okay, let me transfer you.

14:05.095 --> 14:07.139
Why do you use your name
when you answer the phone?

14:07.222 --> 14:09.350
Oh, that's how Pam does it.
I just copy her.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.435
She's sort of
a living legend.

14:11.894 --> 14:12.978
(CHUCKLES)

14:13.062 --> 14:14.188
Try it without
using your name.

14:14.563 --> 14:16.482
Dunder Mifflin. This is.

14:18.150 --> 14:19.443
Oh, yeah, I like it.

14:19.526 --> 14:21.987
Dunder Mifflin.
How may I assist you?

14:22.488 --> 14:23.572
Oh. "Assist."

14:23.655 --> 14:24.698
I sort of like
the old way.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.243
I just prefer it
without the name.

14:28.327 --> 14:30.204
And I thought...
Okay. No, no, no.

14:30.287 --> 14:32.164
I've got to start doing some
managing at some point, right?

14:32.247 --> 14:34.166
I know, I know. I'm sorry.
But if it's not a big deal,

14:34.291 --> 14:35.793
we should just do the old way.
And it really isn't.

14:35.876 --> 14:37.544
Okay. That good?
ERIN: Yeah, okay, good.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.546
Well, I'd like to
change it, actually.

14:39.630 --> 14:41.715
MICHAEL: Well,
you know, whatever...

14:41.840 --> 14:43.425
Yeah. Whatever you
think would work.

14:43.801 --> 14:45.010
What do you...
Yeah.

14:45.427 --> 14:46.720
I think a change
would be nice.

14:46.804 --> 14:50.474
You could do the old way or the, you know.
. . Whichever one you want to do.

14:50.557 --> 14:51.892
Mmm-hmm.
(PHONE RINGING)

14:54.686 --> 14:55.938
DEANGELO: (WHISPERING)
Change it.

14:56.647 --> 14:58.023
(PHONE CONTINUES RINGING)

15:06.407 --> 15:08.742
I'm so sorry. Sorry.

15:13.414 --> 15:15.165
DEANGELO: Come on, you maggot.

15:15.749 --> 15:17.167
Bye-bye, calories.

15:17.543 --> 15:19.837
(EXCLAIMING WITH EFFORT)

15:20.003 --> 15:22.089
(FAST MUSIC PLAYING ON STEREO)

15:22.172 --> 15:23.173
Don't stop, now.

15:23.924 --> 15:25.509
No one's stopping me.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.469
(CONTINUES EXCLAIMING)

15:28.595 --> 15:30.180
All right. Hey.
Okay.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.850
Wow! Look at you.

15:33.434 --> 15:34.601
Don't hug me.

15:34.685 --> 15:36.770
No! Get away, get away.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.607
I see you've been introduced
to our conference room.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.443
Multi-function room, yeah.

15:42.526 --> 15:46.321
So I was thinking that maybe I could
show you around a little bit more?

15:46.405 --> 15:48.699
You could shadow me.
Still a lot to learn, so...

15:50.200 --> 15:52.536
Yeah, you know, I'm feeling
like I'm ready to dive in.

15:52.744 --> 15:55.205
Well, the water's pretty cold.
A lot of octopuses out there.

15:55.289 --> 15:56.457
(CHUCKLING)

15:56.540 --> 15:58.959
Well, I've been taught by the
best octopus hunter in the biz.

15:59.042 --> 16:01.170
I haven't taught you
everything. There's...

16:01.295 --> 16:03.505
Pretty good teacher. I feel
pretty prepared. Mmm...

16:03.589 --> 16:05.757
You know what?
No teacher in the world

16:05.841 --> 16:07.676
could teach this job
in one day.

16:08.469 --> 16:09.470
I think you just about did.

16:09.553 --> 16:11.305
Well, I don't think I did,
so why...

16:12.639 --> 16:14.683
Wanna go?
You'll shadow me?

16:16.226 --> 16:18.896
Let me finish getting dressed.
All right.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.734
Oh, hey, Dwight.
Before I forget,

16:23.817 --> 16:26.320
I would love to know of any
great restaurants in town

16:26.403 --> 16:28.071
if you have any thoughts.

16:28.197 --> 16:30.699
I've got a list here that has
pretty much every place in town.

16:30.782 --> 16:31.909
Oh, great.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.289
Just make sure
you get that back to me.

16:43.962 --> 16:46.006
(EXHALES) I'll get that,
you guys. Don't...

16:46.089 --> 16:47.174
No, I'll help you. Here.

16:47.257 --> 16:48.300
You know, it's just...

16:48.592 --> 16:50.010
You know...

16:51.845 --> 16:54.014
Hi.
Hello. Hi.

16:55.224 --> 16:56.725
Have we met before?

16:57.351 --> 17:00.103
No, not officially. I saw you
coming out of the bathroom earlier.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.524
Well, I guess I'm gonna
go back to my cave.

17:03.649 --> 17:05.608
Okay. It was really
great meeting you.

17:06.359 --> 17:10.113
And that is what
they call a meet cute.

17:16.078 --> 17:19.122
Hey, funny guy. I have a
little midday lull here.

17:19.957 --> 17:21.500
Make me laugh. Huh?
What do you got?

17:21.916 --> 17:23.001
I can't even look
at you. (LAUGHS)

17:23.085 --> 17:24.127
Here we go.

17:24.545 --> 17:26.046
Okay... (LAUGHS)

17:27.172 --> 17:31.802
What do African
Americans call the...

17:34.304 --> 17:35.639
(BOTH LAUGHING)

17:37.641 --> 17:39.268
What?

17:39.351 --> 17:40.561
ERIN: Deangelo?
Yeah?

17:40.644 --> 17:41.645
Did you order a barber?

17:41.728 --> 17:43.522
Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on back here.

17:43.981 --> 17:46.400
Put a pin on that, okay? I can't
wait to hear the punch line.

17:47.526 --> 17:48.944
Finish the joke, Andy.

17:49.653 --> 17:51.446
What do
African Americans call?

17:51.863 --> 17:53.490
I don't know. Help me.

17:54.283 --> 17:56.952
That is so bad-ass.

17:57.661 --> 17:59.663
Just so hardcore.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.373
Yeah, very cool.

18:01.456 --> 18:02.666
Real power move.
Yeah.

18:06.587 --> 18:08.088
I saw a hawk today.

18:09.006 --> 18:10.382
It was just
sitting right there

18:10.465 --> 18:13.135
on the overpass,
looking at me.

18:16.513 --> 18:17.764
Shave me.

18:19.516 --> 18:23.562
Well, this is going
to be funny.

18:23.645 --> 18:25.689
Because it looks like we're
gonna be shaving buddies.

18:25.814 --> 18:29.026
Okay, all right. I love it.
I love it. (LAUGHS)

18:29.109 --> 18:30.944
Michael, this is Reggie.
Hello.

18:31.028 --> 18:32.613
He is the number one

18:32.696 --> 18:34.948
Yelp-reviewed shaver in Scranton.
It's not even close.

18:35.032 --> 18:38.577
And this is Erin, and she's
going to shave my face.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.037
Here we go.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.836
All right.

18:49.046 --> 18:50.964
This is how we do it.

18:51.048 --> 18:52.174
MICHAEL: Mmm.

18:52.257 --> 18:53.258
Feels nice, doesn't it?

18:53.342 --> 18:54.676
It really does.

18:56.720 --> 18:59.389
This is luxury.
Here we go.

19:03.477 --> 19:05.312
Okay.
Okay.

19:05.395 --> 19:07.105
Oh, that is nice.

19:07.898 --> 19:09.149
You wanted to
talk to us, Deangelo?

19:09.232 --> 19:11.860
Oh, yes, yes, please.
Cozy up there.

19:12.027 --> 19:14.571
I just thought we could have some
rap sessions with smaller groups.

19:14.655 --> 19:17.949
You know, we don't really do rap
sessions, we kind of do... God!

19:18.742 --> 19:21.161
We sort of do more of like
powwows and what-ups.

19:21.578 --> 19:22.871
Okay, well,
powwows, then. Fine.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.206
That's...

19:24.748 --> 19:27.250
Hey, Deangelo, my mom just
sent me this picture of Cece.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.377
It is so adorable.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.045
All right, wait, but a
little bit of back story.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.505
She loves dogs,
she calls them dadas...

19:31.588 --> 19:32.673
Dadas.

19:32.756 --> 19:34.299
...and what happens is...
You know what?

19:34.383 --> 19:36.593
Enough about
your baby, okay?

19:37.761 --> 19:38.804
I'm sorry.

19:38.887 --> 19:40.514
Well, we were just... I think
she was just trying to...

19:40.597 --> 19:43.642
No, no, no, I know what you're doing.
Just quit it.

19:45.936 --> 19:48.188
I want to hear from
the rank and file.

19:48.271 --> 19:51.149
How can I be the best
manager for you all?

19:51.233 --> 19:52.901
You know,
what can I do better?

19:52.984 --> 19:54.820
Okay, you know
what, everybody?

19:54.903 --> 19:57.447
There's... You have
to be honest here.

19:57.531 --> 20:01.410
You can't say that everything
is perfect, right?

20:02.119 --> 20:04.705
So, you know,
come up with something.

20:04.788 --> 20:07.624
OSCAR: Well, Deangelo, I'd say
communication could be improved.

20:07.791 --> 20:10.210
People stopped
reading memos.

20:10.293 --> 20:11.712
So everyone
marks them urgent.

20:11.795 --> 20:14.131
Okay, you know what?
I mark it urgent "A,"

20:14.214 --> 20:16.508
urgent "B,"
urgent "C," urgent "D."

20:16.591 --> 20:18.468
Urgent "A" is
the most important,

20:18.552 --> 20:21.972
urgent "D" you don't even
really have to worry about.

20:22.180 --> 20:24.558
Okay, Michael, can you stop talking now?
I have to do your lips.

20:24.683 --> 20:26.476
Don't shave my lips.

20:27.477 --> 20:28.979
DEANGELO:
How about you, Dwight?

20:29.896 --> 20:34.568
Uh, yeah, I'm just right
by your side, so... Yeah.

20:34.735 --> 20:38.488
Personally, Deangelo, I just want
to sit and see how you do things.

20:38.572 --> 20:39.740
I'm really excited.

20:39.823 --> 20:42.617
There must be something you'd like
to see, specifically, improved.

20:42.701 --> 20:45.704
I do think that there is a web
of racism and/or jealousy

20:45.787 --> 20:47.789
that is trying
to keep me down.

20:48.498 --> 20:51.084
Okay. Well,
this has been very helpful.

20:51.501 --> 20:53.587
This is a great start.
Props to you.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.714
(GROANS)
(EXCLAIMS)

20:56.089 --> 20:58.008
Deangelo's great.
I love the guy.

20:58.592 --> 21:01.344
But I'm not sure he's
a good fit for the office.

21:01.678 --> 21:04.598
And also, I'm not sure
if I love the guy.

21:04.806 --> 21:06.475
Did we just totally blow it?

21:06.641 --> 21:10.729
I don't know. I mean, I get that talking
about your kid can be annoying.

21:10.979 --> 21:13.982
You know, everybody thinks their
kid is the cutest in the world.

21:14.065 --> 21:15.776
Cece really is.
Right?

21:15.859 --> 21:17.360
Yeah.

21:19.404 --> 21:21.156
We just got to
get her in here.

21:23.784 --> 21:24.826
What's up?

21:24.910 --> 21:26.745
I don't mean to go off
on a rant here, but...

21:26.953 --> 21:31.166
I wrote the perfect joke.
Topical, edgy, funny.

21:32.375 --> 21:35.962
I saw this thing in the news.
Democrats want electric cars.

21:36.046 --> 21:37.881
Republicans don't.
Right.

21:37.964 --> 21:39.966
I'm thinking,
how crazy is it

21:40.050 --> 21:43.929
that we got a car debate going
on in a city known for gridlock.

21:44.221 --> 21:47.933
Um... Let's not talk politics
in the office, okay?

21:49.226 --> 21:50.560
I like you better
as the funny guy.

21:50.644 --> 21:53.688
I wasn't taking a position. It was
just sort of one of those things.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.526
(LAUGHS)

22:02.864 --> 22:06.159
Now that's funny.
That's funny.

22:06.326 --> 22:07.619
You walk much?

22:07.828 --> 22:09.788
Yeah, right? I mean...

22:10.247 --> 22:11.414
(GROANS)

22:14.626 --> 22:16.294
A little click.
Mmm-hmm.

22:18.839 --> 22:20.173
Deangelo, this box
came for you.

22:20.257 --> 22:21.383
Great, thank you.

22:22.175 --> 22:24.594
That's my stuff. Yeah.
(EXCLAIMS)

22:25.136 --> 22:26.721
Michael, take a look
at this.

22:26.805 --> 22:28.640
Need a hand? Oh, that'd be great.
Thank you.

22:28.723 --> 22:30.016
Hey, you know what?
This office sort of

22:30.100 --> 22:32.477
has a perfect
fung shooey to it, and...

22:33.728 --> 22:36.940
You know, let's not go overboard
with the redecorating.

22:37.065 --> 22:38.650
And I'm still here, so... Wow.

22:38.775 --> 22:39.818
Right?
Ooh.

22:39.901 --> 22:40.902
That's nice.

22:41.152 --> 22:43.280
I still have to look
at this stuff, guys, so...

22:43.530 --> 22:45.532
Oh, man. So this is
a 10-gallon hat?

22:45.615 --> 22:47.200
Yeah, you like that?
10-gallon hat.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.786
Technically, it only
holds about 3 quarts.

22:49.911 --> 22:51.788
A little factoid.
Interesting.

22:52.038 --> 22:54.708
No! No, I've always
loved the southwest.

22:54.791 --> 22:56.877
I got a lot of
this stuff at home.

22:56.960 --> 23:00.881
You know, turquoise and rocks.

23:01.631 --> 23:03.258
I need this job, man.

23:04.259 --> 23:06.303
I love this. I love change.

23:06.636 --> 23:08.430
Change is good,
and you know what?

23:08.513 --> 23:11.433
I think right now, I'm going
to change this supermodel

23:11.516 --> 23:13.226
back into Kevin Malone.

23:13.643 --> 23:14.853
Oh! There he is.

23:14.936 --> 23:16.313
ERIN: (SOFTLY) Oh, my God!

23:18.982 --> 23:20.233
(COUGHS)

23:21.443 --> 23:25.155
All right, this was just...
It was just awful.

23:27.449 --> 23:30.243
Thank you, Michael. You're welcome.
That's better.

23:33.997 --> 23:35.498
Cool, cool.

23:36.166 --> 23:37.292
All right,
see you later, girl.

23:37.417 --> 23:38.543
Hey, hey, hey.

23:40.211 --> 23:41.838
No, I'm good. Keep that.

23:43.506 --> 23:47.510
Hey, funny man. What you got for me?
Make me laugh.

23:54.351 --> 23:55.560
(GRUNTS)

23:58.063 --> 23:59.230
(LAUGHS)

24:05.362 --> 24:08.740
Let's see if
my favorite tea is in...

24:08.865 --> 24:10.200
Whoa! Jeez.

24:10.533 --> 24:11.868
(SCREAMS)

24:13.662 --> 24:14.996
(GROANING)

24:18.249 --> 24:19.542
(YELLING)

24:20.043 --> 24:21.252
(LAUGHING)

24:23.755 --> 24:25.298
(BREATH ING HEAVILY)

24:25.382 --> 24:26.883
(SCREAMS)

24:26.967 --> 24:28.093
That's hot coffee.

24:29.886 --> 24:31.221
Drink some soap.

24:31.429 --> 24:32.555
(PANTING)

24:33.056 --> 24:34.140
Eat some hand soap.

24:34.516 --> 24:35.767
(LAUGHS)

24:42.357 --> 24:44.067
I guess this is my life now.

24:45.276 --> 24:46.987
MICHAEL: Can you believe that?

24:48.822 --> 24:50.699
They're all treating him
like he's some sort of god.

24:50.907 --> 24:53.827
You know, they used to say that
I was the world's best boss.

24:54.369 --> 24:55.954
Now you're a lame duck.

24:56.079 --> 24:57.747
Yeah, well,
you're a retarded owl.

24:58.665 --> 25:00.417
And Deangelo is a fat cow.

25:01.042 --> 25:04.254
He has the same body type that you have.
You're like body twins.

25:04.671 --> 25:06.798
I guess I mean just
from how he used to be.

25:06.881 --> 25:08.425
What do you mean?

25:08.675 --> 25:11.970
I have just come into
the possession of a photograph

25:12.053 --> 25:16.683
that is very embarrassing,
and just may change the way

25:16.766 --> 25:19.769
you perceive a certain
person in this office.

25:20.061 --> 25:21.062
PAM: What is it?

25:21.980 --> 25:23.857
It's a picture of
a super fat guy.

25:23.940 --> 25:25.275
MICHAEL: Yes. (SNICKERS)

25:25.358 --> 25:26.693
DWIGHT: (LAUGHING)
I'll say.

25:27.027 --> 25:28.069
It's Deangelo.

25:28.153 --> 25:29.320
Yes, it is.

25:30.780 --> 25:34.325
This is a photograph taken
of Deangelo Vickers.

25:34.409 --> 25:36.911
I just... I can't get that
picture out of my head.

25:37.078 --> 25:41.833
DWIGHT: This curly-haired
idiot used to be so fat.

25:42.792 --> 25:46.713
It really is a shame that a person's
weight, or their former weight,

25:46.796 --> 25:49.007
makes us think less of them.

25:49.132 --> 25:50.300
(EXCLAIMS IN DIFFERENTLY)

25:50.383 --> 25:51.843
How do you let
yourself go like that?

25:51.926 --> 25:52.886
MICHAEL: I don't know.

25:52.969 --> 25:56.514
I know, Michael. Right? Just
jog in place 10 seconds a day.

25:56.598 --> 25:57.724
That's all it takes.

25:57.849 --> 25:58.975
I know. That's...

25:59.059 --> 26:01.144
I didn't have
10 seconds a day.

26:02.312 --> 26:03.980
I was too busy eating.

26:06.274 --> 26:08.068
That's okay.
Pass it around.

26:08.651 --> 26:10.862
Let everyone take a look. Creed,
have you looked at it yet?

26:10.987 --> 26:12.405
Yes, but I'll gladly
look again.

26:12.530 --> 26:16.659
I used to weigh 425 pounds.

26:17.327 --> 26:19.621
I was unhappy and unhealthy.

26:19.704 --> 26:21.831
Used to go to
tapas restaurants

26:21.998 --> 26:24.167
and gorge myself on
Spanish charcuterie.

26:25.210 --> 26:26.711
I mean, let's be honest.

26:26.836 --> 26:29.839
Tapas is a cuisine for groups.
Not with me.

26:30.256 --> 26:31.633
Tapas party of one.

26:32.092 --> 26:35.261
Looks like you went
over the tapas with food.

26:36.679 --> 26:39.599
One day, I had
a long layover in Phoenix.

26:39.682 --> 26:42.102
I thought I'd do some sightseeing
and my car broke down in Sedona.

26:42.185 --> 26:45.563
I found myself just wandering,
delirious with hunger.

26:46.064 --> 26:49.943
And I swear to God,
I felt an energy.

26:51.402 --> 26:55.615
I felt stronger than I'd ever felt
before, like I could do anything.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.659
Keep in mind, I was naked.

26:57.742 --> 27:00.286
But in that moment,
I felt like I could change,

27:00.370 --> 27:04.541
and I made a promise that I would
lose 202 pounds within a year.

27:04.624 --> 27:07.752
I just... I can't get that image out
of my head, of what you used to...

27:07.836 --> 27:09.671
Michael, stop, please.
...look like. It just...

27:09.754 --> 27:12.340
My friends, my new family,

27:13.049 --> 27:16.594
I stand here today...
Guess how much weight I lost.

27:16.970 --> 27:18.471
Two hundred and two pounds?

27:18.888 --> 27:23.601
203. I beat it by one.
I beat it by one.

27:24.727 --> 27:26.062
Beat it by one.

27:26.813 --> 27:30.150
And that is why
I so firmly believe

27:31.860 --> 27:36.698
that this extraordinary group
of people that I'm looking at

27:37.574 --> 27:39.951
has a chance,
has an opportunity,

27:40.076 --> 27:42.453
to become the greatest
office in the world.

27:43.580 --> 27:46.457
Because we can change anything we want.
I'm living proof.

27:46.541 --> 27:48.084
You know what?
He's right.

27:48.168 --> 27:53.047
If he can lose all that weight,
then I can wear fake hair.

27:53.339 --> 27:55.675
Thank for sharing,
Deangelo. Amazing.

27:55.758 --> 27:56.843
Thank you.

28:04.058 --> 28:07.562
And thank me
for bringing it up.

28:09.939 --> 28:12.233
How do I become
a manager at Sabre?

28:12.400 --> 28:14.319
Well, first things first,

28:14.402 --> 28:16.279
thank you for coming
to me directly, you know.

28:16.362 --> 28:17.822
I know you could
have called Tallahassee,

28:17.906 --> 28:19.824
but they would have
just looped back to me.

28:19.991 --> 28:21.284
So it's cool you
recognized my role here.

28:21.367 --> 28:22.619
I left a message
at corporate.

28:23.369 --> 28:24.412
There you go.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.331
Get a recommendation
from Michael.

28:26.915 --> 28:28.249
That'll put you
right on the short list

28:28.333 --> 28:29.626
for next time
there's an opening.

28:29.918 --> 28:32.170
Can't you just use the recommendation
you already have on file?

28:32.962 --> 28:34.172
What recommendation?

28:34.422 --> 28:36.299
From when he recommended
me to replace him.

28:37.550 --> 28:38.676
(CHUCKLES)

28:39.844 --> 28:40.845
Um...

28:42.096 --> 28:44.349
I'm sorry.
I never know how to act

28:44.432 --> 28:46.643
in these awkward
type situations.

28:47.143 --> 28:50.188
Best whale watching?
Easily the West Coast.

28:50.271 --> 28:51.731
If you're gonna go whale
watching on the East Coast,

28:51.814 --> 28:54.859
you might want to bring a magazine
called West Coast Whales.

28:55.318 --> 28:57.153
(ALL LAUGHING) Because
you're not gonna see any.

28:57.278 --> 29:00.907
(CLEARS THROAT) Snack time! It's the
witching hour. It is the sandwiching hour.

29:01.074 --> 29:02.075
Awesome.

29:02.158 --> 29:03.159
PHYLLIS: Hmm. What you got?

29:03.243 --> 29:05.078
PB and J . My mom's recipe.

29:05.161 --> 29:07.288
Michael, Deangelo
has a peanut allergy.

29:07.372 --> 29:09.582
Okay, I need a wide berth. I need
a wide berth from those nuts.

29:09.707 --> 29:11.709
Michael, what are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

29:11.793 --> 29:14.170
I think Kevin wants one.
Kevin, here you go.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.797
(EXCLAIMS)

29:15.880 --> 29:17.090
OSCAR: Michael,
this is serious.

29:17.173 --> 29:18.925
Do you know what happens
if Deangelo touches a peanut?

29:19.008 --> 29:20.051
(CHUCKLES) What?

29:20.134 --> 29:22.303
Michael, the last time
I was exposed to a peanut,

29:22.387 --> 29:24.597
I was itchy for
three days, okay?

29:24.681 --> 29:27.725
I had to take baths constantly.
I missed the O.J . verdict.

29:27.809 --> 29:29.435
Had to read about it in
the paper like an idiot.

29:29.519 --> 29:32.522
Wait, so you don't go into,
like, shock or die or anything?

29:32.689 --> 29:36.359
No, Jim. Not everything's life and death.
I want to feel comfortable.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.486
Oscar, here you go.
(SMACKING LIPS)

29:38.903 --> 29:40.029
Oh! Whoa!

29:40.113 --> 29:42.323
You're getting nut
particles all in the air.

29:42.407 --> 29:45.868
No one had a problem with the
air here until you came around.

29:54.460 --> 29:57.630
Everyone, mandatory meeting.
Multi-purpose room, now.

29:57.714 --> 29:59.048
No, that's good.
You just stay in there.

29:59.090 --> 30:00.675
Except for Michael. Stay in
there by yourself, loser.

30:00.758 --> 30:02.802
Nobody go in. Nobody go in there.
What?

30:02.885 --> 30:04.304
Why?
Just stay where you are.

30:04.387 --> 30:05.638
Michael, this is insane.

30:05.722 --> 30:07.015
No, it's not
insane, Oscar.

30:07.098 --> 30:09.017
I've been here
for 19 years,

30:09.100 --> 30:10.810
and just because someone
else is called the boss,

30:10.893 --> 30:12.228
you're gonna throw
it all away? No, no.

30:17.900 --> 30:20.153
Listen, you're the one
who decided to leave.

30:20.236 --> 30:22.864
Come on, he's our new boss.
You know we have to do this.

30:23.031 --> 30:24.449
Okay.

30:26.034 --> 30:28.036
Well, who needs them?

30:28.119 --> 30:29.412
Looks like it's just
you and me, Dwight.

30:30.413 --> 30:32.749
Correction.
(CLEARS THROAT) Just you.

30:35.209 --> 30:38.921
All right. Meeting,
multi-function room.

30:39.589 --> 30:41.215
DEANGELO: Apology accepted.

30:42.884 --> 30:43.926
Hold on.

30:46.262 --> 30:49.390
Hey, Michael. Michael,
wait up, hold up. Hold up.

30:50.725 --> 30:51.726
Um...

30:52.935 --> 30:54.062
So, for these meetings,

30:54.145 --> 30:56.064
do you just jump
into business

30:56.147 --> 30:58.024
or do you start
with some chitchat or...

30:59.442 --> 31:02.904
I start with some chitchat
and maybe a couple of jokes.

31:04.280 --> 31:06.783
And you might want to develop
a couple of characters.

31:07.116 --> 31:09.410
You know what? You just.
. . You'll be fine.

31:09.619 --> 31:12.455
Maybe, maybe not. 50-50.

31:13.831 --> 31:17.210
You know, it is too bad for
this place that you're leaving.

31:21.964 --> 31:23.925
Bring it in. Come on.

31:27.011 --> 31:28.471
Bring it.

31:30.306 --> 31:32.975
Okay. Okay.

31:39.482 --> 31:40.733
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

31:44.779 --> 31:45.780
(SIGHS)

31:46.030 --> 31:48.699
Why did you have
to be so damn good?

31:49.075 --> 31:51.786
I... I'm adequate.

31:53.955 --> 31:55.164
I'm half as good as you.

31:55.248 --> 31:56.999
No, no, no.
Come on.

31:57.125 --> 31:59.961
You are good. They know it.
Come on.

32:01.045 --> 32:04.048
I just didn't expect you
to get there so fast.

32:04.340 --> 32:07.635
DEANGELO: Would you do me a favor and enjoy
this time, okay? You've worked so hard.

32:07.718 --> 32:10.847
Get your senioritis on.
It's Lake Havasu time.

32:11.305 --> 32:13.433
I guess I've been
working so hard

32:13.516 --> 32:15.643
I forgot what it's like
to be hardly working.

32:15.726 --> 32:17.061
(CHUCKLING)

32:20.898 --> 32:22.233
Okay.

32:26.195 --> 32:29.657
What is the Native
American girl's name?

32:30.408 --> 32:31.492
You'll figure it out.

32:41.377 --> 32:42.628
DEANGELO:
Thank you, Dwight.

32:42.712 --> 32:43.921
DWIGHT: Thank you, sir.

32:47.633 --> 32:48.885
DEANGELO: Listen up...

32:54.390 --> 32:57.310
Hey, Deangelo.
Want to meet Cece?

33:04.317 --> 33:06.652
That's a cute baby.
(BOTH LAUGH)

33:06.736 --> 33:09.322
Very cute baby.
Adorable. Very cute.

33:09.405 --> 33:10.740
Thank you very much.

33:11.908 --> 33:13.326
I'm sorry, I should
get back to work, but...

33:13.409 --> 33:14.911
Yeah, absolutely. Okay.
Absolutely, yeah.

33:15.077 --> 33:16.078
Thank you so much.
Say, "Bye-bye."

33:16.162 --> 33:17.413
Say, "Bye."
Bye!

33:17.497 --> 33:18.706
See? We knew it.

33:18.789 --> 33:20.333
If he just met her,
he'd understand.

33:20.416 --> 33:21.918
We're back in.

33:22.001 --> 33:23.419
Ha.
Ha.

33:23.503 --> 33:24.587
Right?

33:24.670 --> 33:27.423
I'm telling you, that baby
could be the star of a show

33:27.507 --> 33:30.009
called Babies I
Don't Care About.
