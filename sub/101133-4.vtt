18:55.618 --> 18:59.795
- Of course I do.
We want the same thing.

18:59.872 --> 19:02.047
A way out.

19:02.124 --> 19:04.133
Yes?

19:06.837 --> 19:08.929
I was there when they
brought you in,

19:09.006 --> 19:10.631
screaming for your mother.

19:10.708 --> 19:16.437
The word means nothing to them.
Her death means nothing.

19:16.513 --> 19:19.440
What they've done to you
is unconscionable.

19:19.516 --> 19:21.734
What they will do,
you can't imagine.

19:25.231 --> 19:27.656
If you come with me now,
you have a chance.

19:27.733 --> 19:30.910
- Come where?

19:30.986 --> 19:34.338
- John, there isn't much time.

19:35.866 --> 19:38.301
You don't belong here.

19:50.839 --> 19:53.024
- What are you doing?
- N-nothing.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.059
Hi, how are you?

19:55.135 --> 19:56.463
- Is this a bad time?

19:56.487 --> 19:57.906
- Uh, no, no.
I didn't...

19:57.930 --> 19:59.291
Sorry, I didn't...
Didn't think you were due

19:59.315 --> 20:00.467
for another session until, um...

20:00.491 --> 20:01.908
- Oh, no, I'm... I'm not.

20:01.984 --> 20:05.986
I guess I thought
I'd come up here to talk.

20:08.032 --> 20:11.116
- Oh.
Um, of course.

20:11.193 --> 20:12.752
Please.

20:14.446 --> 20:17.840
What should we, uh...
What should we talk about?

20:20.953 --> 20:23.012
- I haven't been myself.

20:23.089 --> 20:25.600
Who have you been?

20:25.624 --> 20:26.993
- It was different there,
wasn't it?

20:27.017 --> 20:28.144
- It's best not to think
about it.

20:28.168 --> 20:29.404
- Well, all I do
is think about it.

20:29.428 --> 20:30.563
- Oh, then you've come
to the right place.

20:30.587 --> 20:32.596
How are your levels?

20:32.673 --> 20:34.899
- I want to think about it.

20:38.095 --> 20:39.748
It's like...

20:39.772 --> 20:41.647
It's like a piece of me
got stuck there,

20:41.724 --> 20:43.761
or a piece of it
got stuck in me...

20:43.785 --> 20:46.694
Um, I... I don't know.

20:46.770 --> 20:48.248
Do you ever wonder
what would've happened

20:48.272 --> 20:50.289
if we'd never left
that hotel room?

20:51.734 --> 20:53.784
- Yes.

20:53.861 --> 20:54.946
- And we'd probably all
have done

20:54.970 --> 20:57.713
like every Alpha and Beta,
just...

20:57.790 --> 20:59.290
gone on a tour.

20:59.366 --> 21:02.626
Orgy in the pool.
Come back here.

21:02.703 --> 21:04.169
And nothing would be different.

21:04.246 --> 21:06.005
Soma, work,
Pleasure Garden, Feelie.

21:06.081 --> 21:09.258
- It can still be like that,
Lenina, it's...

21:09.335 --> 21:11.302
Nothing has changed.

21:11.378 --> 21:13.479
- I did.

21:16.842 --> 21:19.810
- Nonsense.
I'm gonna get you a yellow.

21:19.887 --> 21:21.957
- I'm trying to talk to you.
I'm trying to tell... tell you...

21:21.981 --> 21:23.564
- No, I'm listening.

21:23.640 --> 21:25.160
It's just you're
not making much sense.

21:25.184 --> 21:26.609
- I was born a Beta Plus.

21:26.685 --> 21:27.829
I'll be a Beta Plus
when the soma man comes.

21:27.853 --> 21:29.278
I really don't choose anything.

21:29.355 --> 21:30.529
- It's chosen for you.

21:30.606 --> 21:32.072
That's the beauty of the system.

21:32.149 --> 21:33.501
- Don't do that.
Don't be an Alpha right now.

21:33.525 --> 21:36.002
Just be Bernard.

21:37.529 --> 21:38.798
- Now, I don't know
what you mean

21:38.822 --> 21:39.966
when you say things like that.
- You do.

21:39.990 --> 21:41.343
I know you do.
When we were there...

21:41.367 --> 21:44.293
- We're not there.
We're here.

21:44.370 --> 21:49.056
And we are lucky to be alive,
Lenina, so...

21:54.671 --> 21:58.432
- Where is he?
How is he?

21:58.509 --> 21:59.859
Who?

21:59.935 --> 22:02.172
- Bernard.
- He... don't worry about him.

22:02.196 --> 22:03.698
- His mother died.
- And?

22:03.722 --> 22:07.450
- Well, that matters...
to them.

22:07.526 --> 22:09.496
- He's fine.
- I want to talk to him.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.780
- I don't think that's
a good idea for either of you.

22:12.856 --> 22:14.856
- I think I liked you
better there.

22:16.902 --> 22:18.410
- You're right.

22:18.487 --> 22:19.981
We never should've left
the hotel room.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.492
I should never have let you
talk me into it.

22:21.516 --> 22:23.957
- We both wanted...
- W-why did you come here?

22:24.034 --> 22:25.520
- Bernard!
- W-what do you want me to say?

22:25.544 --> 22:27.127
D-do you want me
to validate this?

22:27.204 --> 22:30.339
Your... your solipsism, your...
Here's my recommendation.

22:30.416 --> 22:32.727
If you wanna go back to feeling
like yourself, act like it.

22:32.751 --> 22:34.729
Take your soma, go to work,
go to the Pleasure Gardens,

22:34.753 --> 22:36.247
do your duty,
do all the things you did

22:36.271 --> 22:38.647
before we went to that
horrible place, because...

22:40.759 --> 22:42.610
Because you were happy.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.717
- I wasn't.
And neither were you.

22:46.741 --> 22:49.525
- Everybody's happy,
unless they choose not to be.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.846
<i>You think I'm weak.</i>

23:02.923 --> 23:04.384
You think there's some part
of me that's missing,

23:04.408 --> 23:06.041
you and everyone else.

23:06.118 --> 23:08.585
Well, you're right.
We're not equal.

23:08.662 --> 23:11.013
Because I've had to make
myself something more.

23:11.090 --> 23:13.966
I was shot, burned, hunted.

23:14.042 --> 23:16.218
You have no idea what I've lost.

23:16.295 --> 23:20.876
And yet, I'm... And
yet, I'm still here.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.152
What other Alpha Plus
has ever given

23:22.176 --> 23:23.754
more of himself
for the social body?

23:23.778 --> 23:25.405
And that's who
you try to banish?

23:25.429 --> 23:26.937
It can't be done.

23:27.014 --> 23:28.634
So you see,
the mistake was not mine, sir.

23:28.658 --> 23:31.200
It was yours.

23:31.277 --> 23:32.604
You think I'm weak.

23:32.628 --> 23:34.056
You think there's some
part of me that's...

23:56.084 --> 23:58.853
Who's being private now?

24:24.863 --> 24:26.088
- Try not to draw attention.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.031
- I don't like the way
they look at me.

24:33.055 --> 24:36.548
- You're a Savage, a curiosity.

24:36.625 --> 24:41.345
If I let them, they'll put you
in a little box on display,

24:41.421 --> 24:44.773
feed you pills until
you can't remember who you are.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.589
Don't worry,
we're going somewhere safe.

24:48.613 --> 24:50.312
Somewhere beautiful.

24:50.389 --> 24:52.114
- I just want
to get out of here.

24:58.313 --> 25:01.949
- What you see is an ocean.

25:12.127 --> 25:14.512
- Holy shit.

25:15.381 --> 25:18.006
- Here it comes.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.552
That flivver will take you
to the last rocket.

25:21.628 --> 25:25.764
- To where?
- To your home.

25:25.841 --> 25:28.350
You wouldn't believe what
I had to do to arrange it.

25:30.762 --> 25:32.863
There won't be another.

25:43.317 --> 25:45.042
Get in.

25:46.278 --> 25:48.203
Get in.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.275
- I can't go back.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.873
- There's no life for you here.

25:51.950 --> 25:55.197
- I go back, they'll kill me.
- Not to your old life.

25:55.221 --> 25:58.213
You can be something new.

25:58.290 --> 26:01.550
There is more beyond the
Barrier than you can imagine.

26:01.627 --> 26:06.638
Wide open spaces.
Roads leading...

26:06.715 --> 26:09.358
I don't know where they go,
but they're beautiful.

26:09.435 --> 26:12.319
There are people out there.

26:12.396 --> 26:13.895
- How do you know that?

26:13.972 --> 26:17.274
- All Alphas go there...
when we're young.

26:18.477 --> 26:20.110
- Don't lie to me.

26:24.584 --> 26:27.167
You were Warden
of the Savage Lands?

26:28.987 --> 26:31.913
- It doesn't matter now.
- It mattered to her,

26:31.990 --> 26:34.916
to my mom.
You remember Linda.

26:34.993 --> 26:37.322
- Get in.
- She'd get drunk every night

26:37.346 --> 26:39.921
trying to bring you back.

26:39.998 --> 26:44.176
She waited for you for years,
decades.

26:44.252 --> 26:46.331
- Get in.

26:46.355 --> 26:47.846
- Get off of me!

26:50.676 --> 26:55.103
What happened?

26:55.180 --> 26:57.773
She always said you were
coming back for us.

26:57.849 --> 27:00.942
You never even tried, did you?

27:01.019 --> 27:03.445
Did you?

27:03.522 --> 27:06.490
- I wanted her.

27:06.566 --> 27:09.376
And she wanted me.

27:10.737 --> 27:15.916
We were monogamous,
and...

27:15.992 --> 27:18.960
Then she started to swell.

27:19.037 --> 27:20.556
We didn't know
what was happening.

27:20.580 --> 27:21.672
How could we know?

27:21.748 --> 27:23.882
- She loved you.

27:23.959 --> 27:27.636
- I know.
That's why she wanted me to go.

27:27.713 --> 27:28.887
- Bullshit.

27:28.964 --> 27:30.441
- There was no way
for her to come back.

27:30.465 --> 27:32.794
She wouldn't leave you.

27:32.818 --> 27:36.228
There are no mothers here.

27:36.304 --> 27:39.147
No fathers, no sons.

27:39.224 --> 27:42.284
There is now.

27:46.440 --> 27:47.906
- There can't be.

27:55.374 --> 27:57.165
John, wait!

27:57.242 --> 28:03.305
♪ ♪

29:04.643 --> 29:06.746
He just keeps going on and on

29:06.770 --> 29:10.113
and on, and he doesn't know
when to stop, and...

29:10.190 --> 29:13.200
Oh, Marx.
- We have a problem.

29:13.276 --> 29:15.452
- Uh-huh.

29:15.529 --> 29:17.609
I guess we'll have
to pick this up later.

29:21.701 --> 29:24.503
See you later.

29:30.210 --> 29:31.521
- In the Savage way
of conception,

29:31.545 --> 29:33.386
certain characteristics
are passed down...

29:33.463 --> 29:35.016
- Whoa, Bernard, hold on.
Slow down.

29:35.040 --> 29:36.317
- Inherited from one
of two genetic contributors...

29:36.341 --> 29:39.059
- Bernard!
- What?

29:39.135 --> 29:41.311
- How are your levels?
- My levels?

29:41.388 --> 29:44.022
No, look.
They're identical.

29:44.099 --> 29:47.943
This is the Director's,
and this is the Savage's.

29:48.019 --> 29:49.956
- What are you doing
with the Director's optic?

29:49.980 --> 29:52.289
- He left it on his desk,
in his office.

29:52.366 --> 29:54.377
- And what were you doing
in his office?

29:54.401 --> 29:56.910
- You're missing the point.
- Bernard.

29:56.987 --> 30:00.339
Sit down, please.

30:06.597 --> 30:08.505
- You have a better view.

30:08.582 --> 30:11.341
- Oh, I doubt that.
Can I offer you some hydration?

30:11.418 --> 30:13.552
- Yeah, sure.

30:22.762 --> 30:24.855
How well do you know
the Director?

30:24.931 --> 30:27.344
- Ice?
- No, thank you.

30:27.368 --> 30:29.818
I've found him
quite evasive lately, private.

30:29.895 --> 30:32.081
- Bernard, I know you've always
felt somewhat overlooked...

30:32.105 --> 30:33.583
By our Director, for example.

30:33.607 --> 30:35.084
- Do you know he sent me
to the Savage Lands?

30:35.108 --> 30:37.534
And not on holiday, but... - Yes.

30:37.611 --> 30:39.202
- Wait, you knew?

30:39.279 --> 30:40.570
- To tell you the truth,

30:40.647 --> 30:42.275
I thought it might
do you some good.

30:42.299 --> 30:44.519
Bernard, I've always
liked you, but...

30:44.543 --> 30:47.013
I know you don't mean
to be destabilizing.

30:47.037 --> 30:48.411
- Destabilizing?
Me?

30:48.489 --> 30:51.017
- But I do worry
about how this appears.

30:51.041 --> 30:52.610
You raising these questions now,

30:52.634 --> 30:54.103
given your personal feelings
about the Director.

30:54.127 --> 30:55.552
- You're not listening.

30:55.629 --> 30:57.732
- And I know that you lost
the Savage today.

30:57.756 --> 30:58.816
- That...
- Embarrassing.

30:58.840 --> 30:59.801
- That has nothing to do
with this.

30:59.825 --> 31:01.441
- So you see my concern.

31:03.970 --> 31:05.698
Bernard, if I wasn't
hard on you,

31:05.722 --> 31:08.365
I wouldn't be doing my job.

31:22.030 --> 31:25.040
- Is that the Savage?

31:25.116 --> 31:26.458
- Yeah.

32:33.059 --> 32:35.944
- Get away from me!

32:36.021 --> 32:38.789
What are you doing?

32:38.865 --> 32:42.042
Stop it!
Stop it!

32:42.119 --> 32:44.244
Get away from me!

32:44.320 --> 32:46.858
Stop!
Get the fuck away from me!

32:54.339 --> 32:56.910
<i>Get away from me!</i>

32:56.934 --> 32:59.801
- Are you seeing this?
- Yes.

32:59.878 --> 33:02.137
- Over 100 feeds and counting.

33:03.757 --> 33:05.765
I do believe we've found
your Savage.

33:05.842 --> 33:09.269
<i>- Stop it!
Get the fuck away from me!</i>

33:09.345 --> 33:10.548
- He needs help.
Why aren't they helping him?

33:10.572 --> 33:11.980
<i>- Get the fuck away from me!</i>

33:12.057 --> 33:13.365
- Oh, my.

33:13.442 --> 33:14.744
<i>- What is this?
Stop it!</i>

33:16.269 --> 33:18.247
- Where are you going?
- H-he needs me.

33:18.271 --> 33:20.791
- Sit down, it's under control.
There are counselors en route.

33:20.815 --> 33:22.151
- I have to go.

33:22.175 --> 33:23.377
- Bernard, I'm concerned
about your behavior.

33:23.401 --> 33:25.087
- Absolutely, so am I.
Thank you.

36:12.612 --> 36:15.663

something for me.

36:15.740 --> 36:17.040
- What?

36:17.116 --> 36:20.029
- Be the same.

as you were before.

36:31.256 --> 36:34.182
I'll be the same.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.935
We're same.
Do you understand?

36:48.957 --> 36:51.750
- I wanna see my mom.

37:01.286 --> 37:05.296
<i>- What you saw
in that theater was fear.</i>

37:05.373 --> 37:08.299

he knows here.

37:28.521 --> 37:29.865
- We're being tested, Counselor.

37:29.889 --> 37:32.282
That's what this is.
- Tested?

37:32.358 --> 37:36.327
- The system applies
strain to itself.

37:36.404 --> 37:38.632
Indra introduces
a destabilizing element

37:38.656 --> 37:41.749
to make itself stronger,
more stable.

37:41.826 --> 37:43.435
- John?

37:43.511 --> 37:46.170
- He needs someone like you...
to guide him.

37:46.247 --> 37:48.131
To bring him
into the social body.

37:48.207 --> 37:49.516
- Wh... How do...

37:49.592 --> 37:52.635
So you... you... you...
You want me to condition him?

37:52.712 --> 37:55.063
- He's not the one being tested.

38:01.387 --> 38:03.313
Your Director's dead.

38:03.389 --> 38:07.150
- Dead?
How?

38:07.226 --> 38:09.319
- He fell.

38:12.273 --> 38:14.073
- No, he didn't, did he?

38:15.918 --> 38:18.828
- I've seen it before.
- Yes, you have, haven't you?

38:21.074 --> 38:24.092
- Wha... what... what is happening?

38:25.745 --> 38:28.338
- We're at the beginning
of something, Counselor,

38:28.414 --> 38:31.174
something necessary.

38:31.250 --> 38:33.134
This is our test.

38:33.211 --> 38:35.219
We will pass.

38:37.423 --> 38:40.169
- And you've just
become important.

39:30.735 --> 39:34.529
- I don't want you
to feel like this, John.
