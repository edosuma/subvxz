WEBVTT

02:58.485 --> 03:00.419
Happy birthday, baby.

03:19.441 --> 03:21.671
Sorry I'm late. My apologies.

03:21.773 --> 03:22.903
No worries.
I won't keep you long.

03:23.005 --> 03:25.741
I have a deposition
to prepare,

03:25.843 --> 03:29.778
and I understand that
today was your wife's birthday.

03:29.880 --> 03:31.582
It is, yeah.

03:31.684 --> 03:35.421
I do not enjoy pulling you away
from your remembrances,

03:35.523 --> 03:36.950
but I'm sure you understand

03:37.052 --> 03:41.020
that some conversations
are best had in person.

03:41.122 --> 03:46.432
Now, you're sure your associate
is prepared to do this thing?

03:46.534 --> 03:47.994
He is.

03:48.096 --> 03:50.865
Because the results
need to be definitive.

03:50.967 --> 03:52.031
It will be.

03:52.133 --> 03:54.341
And where Luis is concerned,

03:54.443 --> 03:56.508
our intentions are clear?

03:56.610 --> 03:58.939
-Crystal.
-- Good.

03:59.041 --> 04:00.842
This deal with the Russians
is too important

04:00.944 --> 04:03.416
to let Luis Velasquez
get in the way.

04:03.518 --> 04:06.452
Arnold will need to make haste.

04:06.554 --> 04:09.785
Because they want a cash deposit
in my office

04:09.887 --> 04:11.721
by the close of business today.

04:11.823 --> 04:13.591
Not a problem.

04:13.693 --> 04:14.790
- Very well.

04:14.892 --> 04:16.924
Onwards and upwards.

04:17.026 --> 04:19.465
- Mm.

04:19.567 --> 04:21.027
Have a good one.

05:13.422 --> 05:14.850
- Hey, Carlito.

05:16.722 --> 05:19.019
Excuse the search.
I got, uh, trust issues.

05:19.121 --> 05:20.493
I don't even trust myself.

05:20.595 --> 05:21.923
You understand.

05:22.025 --> 05:24.090
I understand.

05:30.901 --> 05:34.771
Yo,<i> corrier,</i> bring him
some, uh -- some, uh, tequila.

05:34.873 --> 05:36.410
<i>-Sí?</i>
-No.

05:38.140 --> 05:40.843
I know you're strictly business.

05:43.882 --> 05:45.716
Let me bless you
with information

05:45.818 --> 05:48.752
that might save your life.

05:48.854 --> 05:50.754
They're never gonna
trust you here.

05:50.856 --> 05:52.822
To people like Arnold Solomon,

05:52.924 --> 05:54.758
you're just
another fucking beaner.

05:54.860 --> 05:56.760
Just when you need them
the most,

05:56.862 --> 05:59.796
they'll throw you under the bus
because they don't like you.

05:59.898 --> 06:01.028
<i>¿Entiendes?</i>

06:05.705 --> 06:07.067
I'm Luis Velasquez.

06:07.169 --> 06:09.707
I'm loved and respected
worldwide.

06:09.809 --> 06:11.071
And you can be, too.

06:11.173 --> 06:14.514
You see, in light of
the Russian threat,

06:14.616 --> 06:17.880
Mr. Solomon thought that
having us as your partner

06:17.982 --> 06:20.080
would be a form of insurance.

06:23.922 --> 06:25.888
Yo, this guy kills me, man.

06:25.990 --> 06:27.087
Are you serious?

06:27.189 --> 06:28.726
You take those
"Soul Train" shoes

06:28.828 --> 06:30.662
and get the fuck out of here.

06:30.764 --> 06:31.894
You stay your side
of the tracks.

06:31.996 --> 06:33.830
I'll stay on mine.
You understand?

06:33.932 --> 06:36.866
-End of negotiations, then?
-Go.

06:36.968 --> 06:38.571
"End of negotiations."

06:38.673 --> 06:40.507
What the fuck is wrong with you?

06:40.609 --> 06:43.708
I should have fucking Hector
just kick you in the ass.

06:43.810 --> 06:45.611
I don't need you
or Arnold fucking Solomon

06:45.713 --> 06:47.173
to deal with the Russians.

06:47.275 --> 06:49.582
What if...

06:49.684 --> 06:51.980
What if Mr. Solomon
raised his offer?

06:52.082 --> 06:53.212
- Let me think about that.

06:53.314 --> 06:55.214
Fuck Solomon.

07:01.288 --> 07:02.826
- Hey!

07:12.740 --> 07:13.936
Carlito.

07:14.038 --> 07:16.202
Ah! Oh!

07:19.207 --> 07:21.878
- That was a hell
of a game yesterday.

07:21.980 --> 07:23.242
I mean, winning isn't
everything,

07:23.344 --> 07:25.849
but it beats the hell
out of coming in second.

07:27.754 --> 07:30.051
You don't care for football
where you come from, do you?

07:30.153 --> 07:33.725
Nah, you're all hockey crazy,
I bet.

07:33.827 --> 07:35.826
You sure this is it?

07:35.928 --> 07:37.597
Looks like
my accountant's building.

07:37.699 --> 07:39.764
My CI has wagered
a parole hearing on it.

07:39.866 --> 07:40.864
We're good.

07:40.966 --> 07:44.802
So, doing anything nice tonight?

07:44.904 --> 07:48.003
I'm impressed, Detective.

07:48.105 --> 07:49.972
It was an alert on my phone.

07:50.074 --> 07:52.007
Happy birthday.

07:52.109 --> 07:54.108
Thank you.

07:57.851 --> 07:59.784
Can't scare it away
with a hangover, Flynn.

07:59.886 --> 08:01.522
I'm fine.

08:04.759 --> 08:07.759
Who the hell is the slick suit?

08:07.861 --> 08:12.830
SS neck tattoo on a distinctly
non-Aryan-looking customer.

08:12.932 --> 08:14.898
Marine snipers use that tattoo.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.262
They're not supposed to,

08:16.364 --> 08:19.672
but Scout Snipers tend
to make their own rules.

08:19.774 --> 08:20.838
Really?

08:20.940 --> 08:24.105
Sounds like someone else I know.

08:24.207 --> 08:26.008
Bite me, Koschek.

08:26.110 --> 08:27.911
In your dreams, tough guy.

08:48.098 --> 08:49.801
- Look at him.

08:49.903 --> 08:52.034
I should run his plate.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.812
Fuck.

09:08.316 --> 09:10.822
Smile, little piggy.

09:10.924 --> 09:12.890
He fucking made us.

09:12.992 --> 09:14.188
I'm bringing him in.

09:32.440 --> 09:34.846
- Look at my nose.

09:38.116 --> 09:40.082
Everything checks out,
Detective.

09:40.184 --> 09:41.281
You're free to go.

09:41.383 --> 09:42.348
Thanks.

09:44.759 --> 09:46.825
Neighbors didn't see anything.

09:46.927 --> 09:51.192
Nothing to go on other than
what we saw or didn't see.

09:51.294 --> 09:52.193
We were stupid.

09:52.295 --> 09:55.163
Should have tailed him.

09:55.265 --> 09:57.165
Oh, geez.

09:57.332 --> 10:00.971
-- Oh, Jesus.
-Yeah.

10:01.073 --> 10:02.742
This is some crazy shit,
Koschek.

10:02.844 --> 10:03.974
Hell of a day.

10:04.076 --> 10:05.679
Like Bourbon Street
after Mardi Gras.

10:05.781 --> 10:07.142
- Yeah, well,
the party's over.

10:07.244 --> 10:09.078
Me and Daley are taking over.

10:09.180 --> 10:11.344
Captain wants you two
to go home.

10:11.446 --> 10:12.785
What?

10:12.887 --> 10:14.985
That's fucking bullshit.
This is our case.

10:15.087 --> 10:16.822
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, down, girl.
-- Dial it back, Flynn.

10:16.924 --> 10:18.285
What did you just say?

10:18.387 --> 10:21.354
Hey, we're just following
Captain's orders, alright?

10:21.456 --> 10:23.092
But we had eyes on the suspect.

10:23.194 --> 10:25.699
And then you let him get away
and all hell broke loose.

10:25.801 --> 10:27.030
Okay?

10:29.463 --> 10:31.705
It's not worth it.

10:31.807 --> 10:33.201
Screw you, Lanier.

10:41.915 --> 10:46.346
♪ I wish to the Lord
I had never had been born ♪

10:46.448 --> 10:50.350
♪ Never shone my eyes upon
the flesh of you and yours ♪

10:50.452 --> 10:55.025
♪ Never have to love again,

11:06.368 --> 11:10.744
♪ I made a little bit on

11:10.846 --> 11:12.372
♪ That sunny day was had ♪

11:12.474 --> 11:15.045

11:15.147 --> 11:19.412
♪ Take me on my word, dear Lord,

11:41.942 --> 11:43.810
Hey.

11:43.912 --> 11:45.339
He's ready to see y'all now.

12:00.555 --> 12:02.389
The case goes to Follett.

12:02.491 --> 12:04.523
He'll know what to do.

12:07.198 --> 12:11.167
Carlo handled Velasquez
like an ice-cold pro.

12:11.269 --> 12:12.432
He didn't want to negotiate,

12:12.534 --> 12:14.808
so your message
has been delivered.

12:14.910 --> 12:16.469
Well, you can't say
I didn't try.

12:18.914 --> 12:20.979
- Tell him.

12:22.247 --> 12:25.313
Two possible witnesses.

12:25.415 --> 12:26.985
They were cops.

12:27.087 --> 12:29.922
Can they tie the hit to you?

12:30.024 --> 12:31.352
Or you to me?

12:31.454 --> 12:34.190
No, they were probably
staking out Velasquez.

12:34.292 --> 12:35.994
I mean, pure coincidence.

12:36.096 --> 12:37.358
- This is your fault.

12:37.460 --> 12:39.899
-I know.
-You should have been there.

12:40.001 --> 12:41.461
- He'll fix this.

12:41.563 --> 12:45.135
In many ways, Carlo is
better at this stuff than I am.

12:45.237 --> 12:47.841
- This is your mess.
You clean it up.

12:47.943 --> 12:50.041
You got 48 hours.

12:50.143 --> 12:51.911
- Consider it done, sir.

12:55.379 --> 12:57.081
You better.

12:57.183 --> 12:58.313
We need addresses.

12:58.415 --> 12:59.985
Right.

13:00.087 --> 13:02.383
Yeah, I called my department
contact on the way here.

13:02.485 --> 13:04.825
I'm just waiting for him
to crack open their files.

13:04.927 --> 13:06.519
Then we're good.

13:10.657 --> 13:12.360
I got a picture
of their license plate,

13:12.462 --> 13:15.561
so it should be a done deal
in no time.

13:16.003 --> 13:18.135
- Good, good.

13:18.237 --> 13:20.104
I got to get this shit
over to Follett.

13:20.206 --> 13:21.534
Then I'll help you finish up.

13:45.362 --> 13:46.867
I think the Russians
will be happy

13:46.969 --> 13:48.297
with the Mexican out of the way.

13:50.631 --> 13:52.466
Very well. Erica.

13:52.568 --> 13:56.206
With the successful conclusion
of this deal,

13:56.308 --> 14:00.474
Arnold is going to become
an extraordinarily powerful man.

14:00.576 --> 14:02.443
Thank you.

14:02.545 --> 14:04.610
Real estate's
never been my thing.

14:04.712 --> 14:06.282
Yeah, too bad.

14:06.384 --> 14:08.350
Velasquez should have known
don't go along with him.

14:08.452 --> 14:11.650
Do you know much about
the ancient Greeks, Gabe?

14:14.358 --> 14:17.161
Well, they valued
their liberty highly.

14:17.263 --> 14:21.033
The Greeks encouraged a kind of
self-reliant individualism.

14:21.135 --> 14:25.532
There were no laws to speak of,
so police weren't necessary.

14:25.634 --> 14:27.974
Sounds like my kind of place.

14:28.076 --> 14:30.636
But the ancient Greeks
drew a line in the sand

14:30.738 --> 14:33.045
when it came
to stealing or robbery.

14:33.147 --> 14:36.081
They did not like
their cattle being stolen

14:36.183 --> 14:39.216
and they did not like
their homes being broken into.

14:39.318 --> 14:44.155
But with no police,
how would they find the culprit?

14:44.257 --> 14:50.260
Actually, they had various
methods to determine guilt.

14:50.362 --> 14:53.428
One of them involved
rounding up 12 suspects.

14:53.530 --> 14:57.003
And a judge would give
each of those suspects

14:57.105 --> 14:59.500
a stick 6 inches long,

14:59.602 --> 15:02.943
but he would tell them
that the thief's stick

15:03.045 --> 15:07.046
would grow an extra inch
by the next morning.

15:07.148 --> 15:10.511
Invariably, the guilty party
would chew off

15:10.613 --> 15:14.251
one inch of his stick,
and then the next morning,

15:14.353 --> 15:16.154
he would be there holding

15:16.256 --> 15:19.652
a 5-inch admission of guilt
stick in his hand.

15:19.754 --> 15:23.689
The point is,
for the 30-something years

15:23.791 --> 15:26.296
that I've been
a defense attorney,

15:26.398 --> 15:29.596
I have learned
one irrefutable truth,

15:29.698 --> 15:34.535
and that is criminals
are their own worst enemy.

15:34.637 --> 15:37.406
Can't say I disagree with you.

15:37.508 --> 15:40.706
Well, listen,
I appreciate the delivery.

15:40.808 --> 15:44.677
And this deal with Vlad is gonna
make everyone a lot of money.

15:44.779 --> 15:46.217
Arnold seems to think so.

15:46.319 --> 15:47.988
You don't?

15:48.090 --> 15:51.057
It really doesn't matter
what I think.

15:51.159 --> 15:52.520
Listen.

15:52.622 --> 15:56.029
Arnold trusts you, and trust
is a valuable commodity.

15:56.131 --> 15:57.426
Mm.

15:57.528 --> 16:00.429
He trusts you to protect him
on the street,

16:00.531 --> 16:03.102
and he trusts me to
look after his legal

16:03.204 --> 16:05.005
and financial interests.

16:05.107 --> 16:08.470
In that respect, we're alike.

16:08.572 --> 16:10.373
We've known each other
for a few years now,

16:10.475 --> 16:13.112
right, Mr. Follett?

16:13.214 --> 16:16.742
You've been very kind to me,
and I appreciate that.

16:16.844 --> 16:19.118
But...

16:19.220 --> 16:20.647
we are nothing alike.

16:27.524 --> 16:28.787
You're reaching.

16:31.363 --> 16:34.199
Come on, now.

16:36.269 --> 16:37.400
Breathe.

16:37.502 --> 16:39.501
-Breathe.

16:44.376 --> 16:47.476
You can't keep
going on like this.

16:47.578 --> 16:50.182
The anger's gonna eat away at
you until there's nothing left.

16:50.284 --> 16:52.052
-- I know.
-- In Afghanistan,

16:52.154 --> 16:54.516
we both lived through
some really bad things.

16:54.618 --> 16:57.618
But you were a cold professional
back in the sandbox.

16:57.720 --> 16:59.389
You still are
when your head's on straight.

16:59.491 --> 17:03.195
But you seem determined
not to want to get any better.

17:03.297 --> 17:05.560
Think I should go to
some overpaid shrink

17:05.662 --> 17:08.497
and spill my guts?

17:08.599 --> 17:10.136
Couldn't hurt.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.600
At the very least,
you might save your career.

17:12.702 --> 17:15.702
I already know
what's wrong with me.

17:15.804 --> 17:18.507
Every time I meet someone,
I automatically think about

17:18.609 --> 17:21.378
the best and most efficient
way to kill them.

17:21.480 --> 17:24.183
I can't switch it off anymore.

17:24.285 --> 17:26.284
- We've all been
where you're at.

17:26.386 --> 17:29.584
You just got to learn
to leave the outside outside.

17:33.359 --> 17:35.425
I got a class.

17:35.527 --> 17:39.330
You need anything,
you know where to find me.

17:39.432 --> 17:41.596
Yo, guys.
There you go. There you go.

17:52.246 --> 17:55.610
That's the guy --
Detective Lance Koscheck, 52.

17:55.712 --> 17:56.809
Past his prime.

17:56.911 --> 17:59.185
Look at him.
What a sad fucking life.

17:59.287 --> 18:02.551
No family, orders takeout,
eats it alone.

18:02.653 --> 18:05.158
My inside guy said
that he and his partner

18:05.260 --> 18:07.160
got booted off the case
this morning, so...

18:07.855 --> 18:09.558
Let's get her done.

18:48.467 --> 18:50.269
-Okay.

18:57.806 --> 18:59.344
Hey, brother.

18:59.446 --> 19:02.512
I'm sorry to disturb you,
but I'm the distraction.

19:02.614 --> 19:04.943
What the fuck are you
talking about, asshole?

19:05.045 --> 19:06.219
Anytime.

19:07.915 --> 19:09.750

19:58.340 --> 20:00.273

20:09.076 --> 20:11.581

to someone who trusts you.

20:11.683 --> 20:12.846
Half truths aren't lies.

20:12.948 --> 20:14.716
You keep telling yourself that.

20:18.326 --> 20:19.820
I admire you, you know,

20:19.922 --> 20:22.295
spending time at her grave
like you do.

20:23.397 --> 20:24.726
I like it there.

20:25.597 --> 20:27.927
One day, I'll probably
have to stay longer.

20:29.931 --> 20:32.404
Ever wish we could have
done things differently?

20:36.806 --> 20:38.575
What's it matter now?

20:45.012 --> 20:47.848
How long have I been training
you to be my replacement?

20:49.082 --> 20:51.324
Two wonderful months.

20:52.789 --> 20:54.723
Don't let Arnold shake you,
okay?

20:54.825 --> 20:56.659
When I go, just act like me.

20:56.761 --> 20:58.331
In time, he'll trust you.

20:58.433 --> 20:59.431
I hope.

21:00.700 --> 21:03.963
I really want the respect that
comes with this job, you know?

21:05.736 --> 21:07.505
What's the fucking point?

21:11.578 --> 21:12.774
What about the other witness?

21:12.876 --> 21:13.940
Don't worry about it.

21:14.042 --> 21:15.414
It's my mess.
I'll clean it up.

21:15.516 --> 21:16.745
You sure about this?

21:16.847 --> 21:19.550
You know how important this is
to Arnold.

21:19.652 --> 21:22.718
- I got a few hitters in
mind, so we'll take care of it.

21:22.820 --> 21:25.556
You should go home.
It's Alex's day.

21:25.658 --> 21:27.855
Yeah.
Look, I appreciate that.

21:29.056 --> 21:33.861
By the way, what you get
from this job, it ain't respect.

21:35.865 --> 21:37.535
It's fear.

21:37.637 --> 21:39.372
It's always fear.

21:40.067 --> 21:41.099
Remember that.

23:40.924 --> 23:43.122
Happy birthday, baby.

23:43.224 --> 23:44.959

24:41.854 --> 24:43.787
Do not hold back.

25:43.717 --> 25:45.310
Go.

Who are you?! What do you want?!

Oh!

Wait, stop, Flynn!

27:32.354 --> 27:34.694
It's me! Lanier, stop it!

27:34.796 --> 27:36.388
Shit, Lanier?

28:01.514 --> 28:03.085
<i>Mierda.</i>

28:24.339 --> 28:26.779
Fuck.

28:52.400 --> 28:54.400
- Yeah. What's up?

28:54.502 --> 28:56.908
- We have
a situation here.

28:57.010 --> 29:00.406
-Ay-yi-yi.
-The three guys I took are dead.

29:01.178 --> 29:03.409
-She's alive.
-Are you serious?

29:03.511 --> 29:07.281
I know. I know.
It's fuckin' shit.

29:07.383 --> 29:10.922
We fucked up.

29:11.221 --> 29:13.254
Okay. I'll call Arnold.

29:32.341 --> 29:34.440
Arnold will see you now.

29:39.414 --> 29:41.480
Stay. He don't want to see you.

29:52.933 --> 29:54.867
Are you fucking kidding me?

29:54.969 --> 29:56.363
- Morning, sir.

29:56.465 --> 29:59.872
You think I need to hear
this shit from the Russian?

29:59.974 --> 30:02.941
Sorry. It's being taken care of.

30:03.043 --> 30:04.844
- Put a bullet
in this bitch's head.

30:04.946 --> 30:06.472
Or I'll put one in yours.

30:06.574 --> 30:10.608
Like I said,
it's being taken care of.

30:10.710 --> 30:14.018
And I think you should rethink
those last few words.

30:14.120 --> 30:18.121
They're insulting to both of us.

30:18.223 --> 30:20.255
Yeah. Alright. I'm sorry.

30:20.357 --> 30:22.092
You know my mouth.

30:22.194 --> 30:24.325
Just get rid of the cop.

30:24.427 --> 30:26.899
It'll be done.

30:27.001 --> 30:28.494
No worries.

30:31.532 --> 30:33.301
You have my word.

30:43.148 --> 30:44.917
Later.

30:45.612 --> 30:47.447
Let's get out of here.

31:09.108 --> 31:10.910
Jesus Christ!

31:11.012 --> 31:12.340
Scared the crap
out of me, Flynn.

31:12.442 --> 31:15.178
-How are you?
-How are you?

31:15.280 --> 31:17.675
Tell me what you know about
the Velasquez hit yesterday.

31:17.777 --> 31:19.446
- Forget Velasquez.
Tell me where you been?

31:19.548 --> 31:22.251
We found machine guns,
three very deceased John Does,

31:22.353 --> 31:24.319
and a stack of spent brass
at your house.

31:24.421 --> 31:28.092
-Three John Does?
-Yeah. Three.

31:28.194 --> 31:29.654
One on the lawn looked like
he'd been put through

31:29.756 --> 31:31.062
a meat grinder.

31:31.164 --> 31:33.262
No dental records, no prints.

31:33.364 --> 31:36.034
Guy on the lawn was Lanier.

31:36.136 --> 31:37.134
Oh, bullshit.

31:37.236 --> 31:39.466
- It was him.

31:39.568 --> 31:41.237
Did you know?

31:43.406 --> 31:45.208
-No, no, fuck no, Vanessa.
-Did you know?

31:45.310 --> 31:47.309
-Of course not.
-You're his partner.

31:47.411 --> 31:49.080
You're fucking in on this, too.

31:49.182 --> 31:51.643
Yeah, I'm his partner,
but I'm not married to the guy.

31:51.745 --> 31:53.513
If he's dirty,
it's got nothing to do with me.

31:53.615 --> 31:57.517
They had my home address, Daley.

31:57.619 --> 32:00.388
I didn't know. I swear.

32:01.424 --> 32:04.128
Has anyone heard from Koschek?

32:04.230 --> 32:05.525
No.

32:08.530 --> 32:10.266
Look, you need to come in.
Alright?

32:10.368 --> 32:12.400
Captain's pitching a shit fit
this morning.

32:12.502 --> 32:14.138
She's about to issue
a BOLO for you.

32:14.240 --> 32:16.074
I think I'm better out here
for now.

32:16.176 --> 32:17.702
You're crazy, now. Look...

32:17.804 --> 32:20.342
we'll just go in together.

32:20.444 --> 32:22.179
We'll just ride right over
to the precinct.

32:22.281 --> 32:24.214
Listen, you got to find Koschek.

32:24.316 --> 32:26.150
Put him in a safe house.

32:26.252 --> 32:27.481
If this guy came for me,

32:27.583 --> 32:29.384
he's probably gunning
for Koschek, too.

32:29.486 --> 32:31.551
He killed Velasquez, now he's
coming for the witnesses.

32:31.653 --> 32:34.686
Then you definitely
need to come in.

32:35.656 --> 32:37.227
I got to go, Daley.

32:37.329 --> 32:39.097
Where you going, Vanessa?

32:39.199 --> 32:40.758
You know it isn't safe for me.

32:40.860 --> 32:43.365
What do you mean it's not --
Vanessa!

33:07.688 --> 33:09.490
Yeah?

33:09.592 --> 33:12.229
You finally decide to return
my call, you fucking asshole.

33:12.331 --> 33:16.101
Did you kill Lanier?
Did you kill my partner?

33:16.203 --> 33:17.465
- Excuse me?

33:17.567 --> 33:22.041
No, no, no, no.
I ask, and you answer.

33:22.143 --> 33:23.735
Get it?

33:23.837 --> 33:25.143
Where is she?

33:25.245 --> 33:27.376
She's on the run.

33:27.478 --> 33:29.279
Now, listen.

33:29.381 --> 33:30.808
This whole plan of yours
is getting good cops killed.

33:30.910 --> 33:33.613
You're going to make me cry.

33:33.715 --> 33:35.219
Listen, I want out!

33:35.321 --> 33:36.583
- There's no out here.
You want out?

33:36.685 --> 33:38.321
You go buy yourself
a fucking razor blade

33:38.423 --> 33:39.685
and cut your fat fucking wrist,

33:39.787 --> 33:42.259
you dirty cop.

33:42.361 --> 33:45.229
I hear nothing.

33:45.331 --> 33:47.198
So you find her.

33:47.300 --> 33:49.596
Get me an address.

33:50.500 --> 33:53.402
Or I'll pay you a visit.

34:01.346 --> 34:03.247
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

34:06.186 --> 34:08.582
We definitely
underestimated her.

34:08.684 --> 34:10.518
She's well trained.

34:10.620 --> 34:13.587
Daley's sending me
her file, actually.

34:13.689 --> 34:16.359
He's another loose end,
you know?

34:23.533 --> 34:27.172
He's good with computers.
He's smart.

34:27.274 --> 34:29.141
Best thing of all,
he's scared of me.

34:29.243 --> 34:30.505
-Mm.
-I'm serious.

34:30.607 --> 34:33.508
He's terrified.
He'll do anything I say.

34:33.610 --> 34:35.213
For now.

34:35.315 --> 34:36.247
As soon as he ceases
to be an asset,

34:36.349 --> 34:39.184
he's a ghost, so...

34:39.286 --> 34:41.483
By the way, we need someone
to clone Flynn's phone

34:41.585 --> 34:43.848
so we can trace her
when she answers.

34:43.950 --> 34:45.289
You got someone?

34:45.391 --> 34:47.819
I don't, but Arnold does.

34:47.921 --> 34:50.756
I'll give him a call.

34:50.858 --> 34:52.593
-Miss.
-Alright.

35:59.530 --> 36:01.563
Hello?

36:12.576 --> 36:14.345
Walter?

37:20.941 --> 37:23.381
Oh, Walter.

37:27.981 --> 37:29.750
Fuck.

37:39.091 --> 37:42.301
Hey, I need to talk to you.
It's important.

37:43.535 --> 37:44.666
I need your help.

37:44.768 --> 37:46.305
Of course. Anything.

37:46.407 --> 37:48.802
I need you to get me
some info on someone.

37:48.904 --> 37:51.068
Who's the lucky guy?

37:51.170 --> 37:53.312
Uh, Scout Sniper.

37:53.414 --> 37:54.808
I think he's local.

37:54.910 --> 37:57.910
Pull up a chair here.
See what we got here.

37:58.616 --> 38:01.848
- Can't find anything
on our database.

38:01.950 --> 38:05.489
-Guy's a damn ghost.
-Lucky for you, my database

38:05.591 --> 38:07.755
starts where the P.D.
leaves off.

38:10.892 --> 38:15.026
Wait. That's him.

38:15.128 --> 38:17.028
Scout Sniper courses
takes men like this

38:17.130 --> 38:18.997
and teaches them to do things
that most of us would find

38:19.099 --> 38:20.669
difficult to stomach.

38:20.771 --> 38:22.572
Some men are just
good at killing.

38:22.674 --> 38:24.002
Yo, V, if you want me
dig in deeper,

38:24.104 --> 38:28.710
I need to know,
what's our level of emergency?

38:28.812 --> 38:32.978
He killed my partner
and another officer last night.

38:36.819 --> 38:38.423
What can I do?

38:38.525 --> 38:40.821
If you run, he'll find you.

38:40.923 --> 38:44.462
-That's comforting.
-That's the truth. This, uh...

38:44.564 --> 38:47.861
This is Carlo Garcia
is in a whole nother league.

38:47.963 --> 38:49.797
You're fighting out
of your weight class.

38:49.899 --> 38:51.634
I'm going to put a cap
in this fucker.

38:51.736 --> 38:52.833
You're gonna get
yourself killed.

38:52.935 --> 38:55.374
Well, I can't run.

38:55.476 --> 38:56.969
I can't fight.

38:57.071 --> 38:58.509
They have someone
inside the department,

38:58.611 --> 39:00.478
so I can't turn myself in.

39:00.580 --> 39:02.711
Doesn't look like
I got a lot of options.

39:02.813 --> 39:05.010
Shape your battlefield and wait
till he comes for you.

39:05.112 --> 39:08.915
It will be unexpected.
So you've got to be ready.

39:09.017 --> 39:10.554
And then?

39:10.656 --> 39:11.852
If you're lucky,
you'll get your shot.

39:11.954 --> 39:15.823
Hm, that's, uh...

39:15.925 --> 39:17.561
terrible advice.

39:17.663 --> 39:21.829
I know, but you don't
go chasing the devil.

39:22.601 --> 39:26.702
So you fucked up.
Now you need my help.

39:26.804 --> 39:28.836
- She has her cell,
and we have her number.

39:28.938 --> 39:31.806
All we need is someone
to hack into it,

39:31.908 --> 39:35.513
track her down, Carlo, and I
will take care of the rest.

39:35.615 --> 39:37.009
No big deal.

39:37.111 --> 39:38.450
This is his problem.

39:38.552 --> 39:40.452
I know, but he's my partner.

39:40.554 --> 39:42.047
- Only for two months.

39:42.149 --> 39:44.984
You think he'd do
the same thing for you?

39:45.086 --> 39:46.821
- I would hope so.

39:48.561 --> 39:54.059
I want to say something to you,
and I mean this as a friend.

39:54.161 --> 39:55.929
Go ahead, shoot.

39:56.031 --> 40:00.197
I'm concerned that
you've become unreliable.

40:00.299 --> 40:01.902
- It's been
a rough couple days.

40:02.004 --> 40:03.970
We'll clean this mess up,
and then it's clear sailing.

40:04.072 --> 40:05.675
No big deal.

40:05.777 --> 40:08.612
I think you need a vacation.
You're getting old.

40:08.714 --> 40:11.747
Yeah,
both of those are correct,

40:11.849 --> 40:15.487
but be honest with yourself.

40:15.589 --> 40:17.016
You looked in the mirror lately?

40:17.118 --> 40:19.458
-I'd trade my soul

40:19.560 --> 40:20.624
to be 20 again.

40:20.726 --> 40:24.056
What are you two
rambling on about?

40:24.158 --> 40:27.994
That youth is wasted on
the young.

40:28.096 --> 40:30.568
And unfortunate
that experience is wasted

40:30.670 --> 40:33.164
on those who don't
take time to enjoy life.

40:33.266 --> 40:35.672
Arnold, I have a lot to do.
We'll be back here this evening.

40:35.774 --> 40:37.905
Let's go.

40:38.007 --> 40:42.140
I'll call my guy.
He'll be in touch.

40:42.242 --> 40:44.076
Alright?

40:44.178 --> 40:46.683
Take care, Gabe. Let's go.

40:46.785 --> 40:48.883
Later, boss.

41:06.639 --> 41:09.706
Seven languages.

41:09.808 --> 41:12.676
Combat action ribbon.

41:12.778 --> 41:15.239
Firearms instructor.

41:16.682 --> 41:20.552
Detective Service ribbon.
Police star.

41:20.654 --> 41:21.949
Geez.

41:30.927 --> 41:33.598
April 2nd.

41:38.638 --> 41:40.869
April 2nd.

43:35.755 --> 43:37.249
This is Officer Lopez.

43:37.351 --> 43:39.889
-I'm looking for Daley.
-He hasn't come in today.

43:39.991 --> 43:41.154
I'm covering his desk.

43:41.256 --> 43:43.024
-Where is he?
-Ma'am, that's not --

43:43.126 --> 43:45.158
This is Detective Flynn.
I need to speak with him.

43:45.260 --> 43:46.830
- Detective Flynn?

43:46.932 --> 43:49.096
I'm under strict orders
to advise you to come in.

43:50.529 --> 43:52.704
Damn it!

43:55.038 --> 43:57.709
-Good to see you.
-Oh, nice to see you.

43:57.811 --> 44:00.712
If you guys need anything else,
I'd be more than happy.

44:04.410 --> 44:06.014
Business or pleasure?

44:06.116 --> 44:07.752
What do you mean?

44:07.854 --> 44:09.050
What you're thinking about.

44:09.152 --> 44:12.251
Well, well,
a little bit of both.

44:12.353 --> 44:13.758
Intriguing.

44:13.860 --> 44:16.959
Mm-hmm.
Yeah. I'm thinking about Gabe.

44:17.962 --> 44:19.192
What about him?

44:19.294 --> 44:21.898
Honestly, he's becoming
a liability.

44:23.968 --> 44:25.396
I don't want to pry
into your business.

44:25.498 --> 44:27.200
You know that.

44:27.302 --> 44:28.872
But remember, Gabe doesn't just
work for you.

44:28.974 --> 44:31.072
He's your friend.

44:31.174 --> 44:34.174
That's what makes it so hard.

44:35.947 --> 44:37.980
- Hey, what the fuck?

44:38.082 --> 44:39.949
Hey, what are you guys doing?

44:55.967 --> 44:58.066
- Give me the fucking gun.

45:14.018 --> 45:16.051
Look at me, motherfucker.

45:27.262 --> 45:28.833
Yeah? What's up?

45:28.935 --> 45:31.165
- Gabe, they've hit Arnold.

45:31.267 --> 45:32.936
-Oh.
-Took one in the arm,

45:33.038 --> 45:34.102
but he's okay.

45:34.204 --> 45:37.204
-Who was on point?
-LaFontaine.

45:37.306 --> 45:40.174
Arnold was having dinner
with his wife.

45:40.276 --> 45:41.538
They made a mess of her.

45:41.640 --> 45:43.947
-Where they at now?
-City medical center.

45:44.049 --> 45:46.015
Second floor.

45:59.426 --> 46:02.064
He's been asking for you.

46:03.331 --> 46:04.396
How's Tomi?

46:04.498 --> 46:07.234
She died on the operating table.

46:07.336 --> 46:10.006
Arnold is going
to be raising hell.

46:10.108 --> 46:13.240
As official counsel,
I must strongly advise

46:13.342 --> 46:15.011
against that course of action.

46:15.113 --> 46:17.915
We spent too many years
turning this into

46:18.017 --> 46:20.544
a legitimate business
to throw it all away

46:20.646 --> 46:23.888
over a base desire for revenge.

46:23.990 --> 46:25.549
So your ancient
Greeks don't believe in

46:25.651 --> 46:27.353
an eye for an eye, huh?

46:27.455 --> 46:30.521
- Well, actually, they
called it necessary reciprocity.

46:30.623 --> 46:34.393
When Odysseus returned to Ithaca
after the Trojan War

46:34.495 --> 46:37.528
and found that his wife Penelope
had been unfaithful,

46:37.630 --> 46:41.202
he murdered all 108
of her noble suitors,

46:41.304 --> 46:45.338
and then he slaughtered
and mutilated his own servants

46:45.440 --> 46:49.881
for allowing
the indiscretions to happen.

46:50.378 --> 46:53.852
Sounds like a man who brought
his war home with him then.

46:53.954 --> 46:58.219
He did indeed.
And everyone paid the price.

47:02.027 --> 47:03.928
So I'm leaving.

47:04.030 --> 47:05.556
Whether or not I return
will depend on

47:05.658 --> 47:07.492
Arnold's course of action.

47:07.594 --> 47:11.496
But I am not
interested in fighting a war.

47:11.598 --> 47:14.301
Having said that,
I don't think you and I

47:14.403 --> 47:17.271
will be seeing each other again.

47:17.373 --> 47:19.174
I like you, Gabe.

47:19.276 --> 47:21.913
Don't get caught
in the undertow.

47:34.158 --> 47:36.125
They killed her.

47:36.227 --> 47:39.491
They killed my wife.

47:39.593 --> 47:43.264
-Carlo.
-Yes?

47:43.366 --> 47:46.597
Clear this room.
Get out of here now.

47:46.699 --> 47:50.106
- Alright, everyone.
Let's go. Do as the man says.

47:50.208 --> 47:53.241
Get out of here, boys.
Don't move.

47:57.247 --> 47:58.543
I'm sorry.

47:58.645 --> 48:01.546
-Boss --
-Shut up. Don't talk.

48:04.056 --> 48:05.957
You see that?

48:06.059 --> 48:07.926
You see what you fuckin' did?

48:12.559 --> 48:14.559
Stop it!

48:14.661 --> 48:16.066
Get the fuck out of here.

48:16.168 --> 48:18.497
Go! Go.

48:19.302 --> 48:20.631
Close the door!

48:20.733 --> 48:22.402
Carlo, stay.

48:24.307 --> 48:26.274
I want them to suffer.

48:26.376 --> 48:29.145
Don't you worry, baby.
They will.

48:29.247 --> 48:32.984
First, you're going
to need some rest.

48:33.086 --> 48:36.515
-Not if they're still breathing.
-They won't be for long.

48:38.519 --> 48:43.357
We go to war, we need you
thinking clearly, alright?

48:43.459 --> 48:45.491
Stakes are way too high.

48:45.593 --> 48:47.262
- You're right.

48:49.299 --> 48:51.332
You're always right.

48:51.434 --> 48:53.169
- I'm gonna
stay here for a while.

48:53.271 --> 48:55.732
Go find out what you can.

48:55.834 --> 48:57.305
I'll see you later, man, okay?

48:57.407 --> 48:59.010
Thank you.

49:02.708 --> 49:04.246
I loved her.

49:04.348 --> 49:06.215
She loved you, too.

49:07.746 --> 49:10.186
I'm sorry, brother.

49:10.288 --> 49:12.386
- I really loved her.

49:12.488 --> 49:14.256
I know.

49:19.428 --> 49:21.263
Oh, fuck.

50:31.830 --> 50:36.371
Shooters were professionals.
Not from around here.

50:36.473 --> 50:38.241
What kind of gun they use?

50:38.343 --> 50:40.639
In Mexico, it's known
as a cuerno de chivo

50:40.741 --> 50:43.246
because the magazine looks
like a goat's horn.

50:43.348 --> 50:45.182
They just love it,
and they definitely use it

50:45.284 --> 50:46.711
to make a statement.

50:46.813 --> 50:48.713
If you asked me, the money is
on the Colombian Mexican.

50:48.815 --> 50:50.847
Someone tied to Velasquez then.

50:50.949 --> 50:53.817
Or made to look that way.

50:53.919 --> 50:56.358
Oh, yeah? Who do you figure?

50:56.460 --> 50:58.591
Have we heard from Vlady?

50:58.693 --> 51:01.528
I don't know, boss.
What motive would he have?

51:01.630 --> 51:03.596
Me out of the way.

51:03.698 --> 51:05.763
Makes things a lot easier,
doesn't it?

51:05.865 --> 51:08.172
Follett's gonna be pissed
if we move on Vlady.

51:08.274 --> 51:09.338
That's for damn sure.

51:09.440 --> 51:10.603
- Fuck him!

51:10.705 --> 51:12.605
I'll handle that son of a bitch.

51:12.707 --> 51:15.311
It's my call.

51:15.413 --> 51:16.840
You sure about this?

51:16.942 --> 51:19.414
- You're goddamn right.

51:19.516 --> 51:21.581
They killed my wife!

51:21.683 --> 51:23.286
We're talking about her!

51:23.388 --> 51:26.520
Fine. You got it.

51:28.425 --> 51:30.491
It'll get done.

51:39.403 --> 51:42.371
- The hit had to be
retaliation for Velasquez.

51:42.473 --> 51:44.604
Vlady has no motive.

51:44.706 --> 51:48.179
I'm telling you,
Arnold's losing it.

51:48.281 --> 51:49.807
This is a mistake.

51:49.909 --> 51:52.249
You don't just hit a Russian
mobster 'cause you're pissed.

51:57.751 --> 52:01.654
Got a hit on the girl.
She's at the Terrace Motel.

52:01.756 --> 52:05.922
Great. Deal with this,
then I'll finish her off.

52:06.024 --> 52:08.199
Question. Look.

52:08.301 --> 52:10.168
I'm trying to hide it
in the front.

52:10.270 --> 52:12.632
Looks like a big fat dick,
so I just --

52:12.734 --> 52:13.897
I don't -- I don't
know what to do.

52:13.999 --> 52:16.471
How do you hide a gun
with a camera?

52:18.607 --> 52:20.442
How do you do it?

52:20.544 --> 52:22.939
Buck up, man.

52:23.041 --> 52:25.414
- What?

53:21.099 --> 53:22.570
I'm gonna head up
to see Vlady, huh?

53:22.672 --> 53:24.836
What's up, man?

53:25.344 --> 53:26.838
How's the Russian doing?

53:26.940 --> 53:28.642
He up there yelling
at everybody, stressed out.

53:28.744 --> 53:30.281
Geez. What's new?

53:30.383 --> 53:33.713
Hey, keep an eye
on this guy for me, huh?

53:40.722 --> 53:43.426
And I'm still here
at the kids table, huh?

53:43.528 --> 53:45.659
They don't let you listen to
the grown-ups talk either, huh?

53:45.761 --> 53:49.333
-Disrespectful is what it is.
-Yeah.

53:57.068 --> 53:59.739
Whoa, whoa. Hey, hey.
No, no, no.

53:59.841 --> 54:02.808
Strict orders, no visitors.

54:03.481 --> 54:05.943
Arnold called Vlady.
I have a delivery for him.

54:06.045 --> 54:09.452
-Don't you go in there, Gabe.
-Why do you say that?

54:09.554 --> 54:12.488
I have an appointment.
I am making a payment.

54:12.590 --> 54:17.295
-I don't give a fuck.
-Look, I have an appointment.

54:17.397 --> 54:18.890
Here is the envelope.

54:18.992 --> 54:21.024
Listen, Vlady makes
his Russian calls,

54:21.126 --> 54:24.060
but I make all his American
calls on the accountability

54:24.162 --> 54:26.997
that he does not
speak great English.

54:27.099 --> 54:28.702
-You're lying, dude.

54:28.804 --> 54:32.068
I don't know, man.
Maybe they texted each other.

54:32.170 --> 54:34.609
But it's going to be me or you.

54:34.711 --> 54:38.041
Either way,
he's going to have to get it.

54:41.453 --> 54:43.387
You want to take it to him?

54:47.822 --> 54:49.459
Go ahead. I'm sorry, Gabe.

54:49.561 --> 54:51.087
Thank you, brother.

54:51.189 --> 54:54.057
It's been tense. He's fucking
losing his mind. I'm sorry.

54:54.159 --> 54:55.399
Ah!

55:10.812 --> 55:12.009
Ah!

55:40.006 --> 55:41.610
Ah!

56:11.939 --> 56:14.071
You should have just shot him.

56:15.008 --> 56:16.810
Kitchen.

56:31.827 --> 56:34.531
- Tell me again.
Why are we burning this place?

56:36.194 --> 56:38.469
It's called sending a message.

56:53.651 --> 56:57.752
-Is it done?
-You watching the local news?

56:57.854 --> 57:01.019
-No witnesses this time?
-No.

57:01.121 --> 57:03.890
Good. They'll blame
the Mexicans.

57:03.992 --> 57:05.958
You mean you'll
blame the Mexicans?

57:06.060 --> 57:07.663
What's with the attitude?

57:07.765 --> 57:11.128
We just kicked a hornet's nest
for no good reason.

57:11.230 --> 57:13.867
- I gave the order.
That's all the reason you need.

57:13.969 --> 57:16.672
What's the deal
with the fucking detective?

57:16.774 --> 57:20.775
You gave me your word.
So take care of her.

57:20.877 --> 57:23.074
-I will.
-Don't tell me.

57:23.176 --> 57:24.713
Show me.

57:26.310 --> 57:30.081
I'm telling you. He's losing it.

57:30.183 --> 57:32.017
Drop me at my car.

57:32.119 --> 57:33.755
- Got to
take a shower anyways.

57:33.857 --> 57:36.153
I'm all fucking covered
in Esteban.

57:36.255 --> 57:38.529
- Bodies of a nightclub
owner and three of his staff

57:38.631 --> 57:41.862
were discovered in the charred
remains of a property fire.

57:41.964 --> 57:44.502
A pair of audacious
cartel style killings

57:44.604 --> 57:47.263
rocked the city yesterday
when gunmen opened fire

57:47.365 --> 57:49.166
on a restaurant in Jackson.

57:49.268 --> 57:52.609
One of the shooting victims has
been identified as Tomi Solomon,

57:52.711 --> 57:55.040
wife of local real estate
magnate Arnold Solomon,

57:55.142 --> 57:56.910
who's long been suspected
of having ties

57:57.012 --> 57:58.615
to organized crime.

57:58.717 --> 58:00.045
Solomon, seen here --

58:00.147 --> 58:03.246
You went after the competition.

58:03.348 --> 58:06.216
But the competition hit back.

59:20.292 --> 59:23.898
- Gabe here.
Leave a message.

59:24.000 --> 59:26.802
- Hey, Gabe.
Where the fuck are you?

59:26.904 --> 59:28.133
This is the third time
I've called.

59:28.235 --> 59:31.642
We're here at the motel
waiting for you.

59:31.744 --> 59:35.745
This is going down
whether you're here or not.

59:42.688 --> 59:45.183
No answer from Gabe. Let's roll.

59:58.198 --> 1:00:01.100
You want it all, don't you,
bastard.

1:00:30.495 --> 1:00:32.934
On the floor quick!

1:01:05.067 --> 1:01:07.232
What the fuck is
going on out here?

1:01:14.780 --> 1:01:15.878
Fuck.

1:01:33.931 --> 1:01:35.029
Get in!

1:01:35.131 --> 1:01:36.767
Fuck you!

1:01:36.869 --> 1:01:39.000
Get in or you're dead!

1:01:40.136 --> 1:01:42.135
Come on!

1:02:06.865 --> 1:02:08.161
Yeah, go ahead.

1:02:08.263 --> 1:02:09.426
What the fuck
are you doing, Gabe?

1:02:09.528 --> 1:02:10.768
Have you lost your mind?

1:02:10.870 --> 1:02:12.330
You don't understand, man.

1:02:12.432 --> 1:02:14.398
- Quit the fucking bullshit
right now.

1:02:14.500 --> 1:02:18.776
Just bring her back.
You're playing with my life.

1:02:18.878 --> 1:02:21.042
- Ain't gonna happen.

1:02:26.082 --> 1:02:28.148
You know what happens now?

1:02:28.250 --> 1:02:29.380
I wrote the book.

1:02:29.482 --> 1:02:31.283
You do what the fuck
you go to do.

1:02:39.129 --> 1:02:41.293
Put your safety belt on.

1:03:00.919 --> 1:03:02.215
Go ahead.

1:03:02.317 --> 1:03:03.986
What the fuck is going on?

1:03:04.088 --> 1:03:05.823
- I'm done, man.

1:03:05.925 --> 1:03:08.056
I'm tendering
my resignation, sir.

1:03:08.158 --> 1:03:10.256
- You quit when
I say you quit.

1:03:10.358 --> 1:03:11.994
Now, where's the girl?

1:03:12.096 --> 1:03:14.392
- She's with me.
That's where she staying.

1:03:14.494 --> 1:03:16.526
If you're smart,
you'll let us both go.

1:03:16.628 --> 1:03:19.001
You think I'm going
to let her walk away?

1:03:19.103 --> 1:03:20.266
- Listen, man.

1:03:20.368 --> 1:03:23.302
You were with me when
Alex died, right?

1:03:23.404 --> 1:03:24.908
Tomi is dead now.

1:03:25.010 --> 1:03:26.569
- You bring that up,
you piece of shit?

1:03:26.671 --> 1:03:28.340
Don't let it ruin your life,
my friend.

1:03:28.442 --> 1:03:30.078
I'm going to hunt you down.

1:03:30.180 --> 1:03:32.377
Don't make promises
you can't keep, okay?

1:03:32.479 --> 1:03:35.380
You know what this means.

1:03:35.482 --> 1:03:37.085
Have a good night.

1:03:43.522 --> 1:03:46.127
Bring me that bastard's head.

1:03:49.297 --> 1:03:52.034
Let me bring you in.

1:03:52.136 --> 1:03:53.431
You can turn state
against Solomon.

1:03:53.533 --> 1:03:57.039
We'd both be dead
before I could testify.

1:03:57.141 --> 1:04:00.537
That guy, Carlo Garcia,
he your partner?

1:04:00.639 --> 1:04:02.473
- Yeah, he was.

1:04:02.575 --> 1:04:04.079
If we're lucky,
he'll put as much distance

1:04:04.181 --> 1:04:05.982
between us as he can.

1:04:06.084 --> 1:04:08.578
I had lots of luck lately.

1:04:08.680 --> 1:04:10.085
All of it bad.

1:04:10.187 --> 1:04:13.253
Oh, relax.
How much worse can it get?

1:04:15.961 --> 1:04:19.930
I've got a feeling
I'm gonna find out.

1:04:49.456 --> 1:04:51.423
Relax.

1:04:51.525 --> 1:04:53.458
Sit down.

1:04:54.593 --> 1:04:56.428
We can both use this.

1:05:03.008 --> 1:05:05.371
Is this your wife?

1:05:05.473 --> 1:05:07.670
Yes. Yes.

1:05:07.772 --> 1:05:10.145
- She passed.

1:05:10.247 --> 1:05:11.982
Mm-hmm.

1:05:18.221 --> 1:05:19.616
You okay?

1:05:19.718 --> 1:05:21.585
Look, you've worked for
Solomon for years.

1:05:21.687 --> 1:05:23.653
You could have dropped me back
at the motel.

1:05:23.755 --> 1:05:27.327
Now we're
having drinks.

1:05:27.429 --> 1:05:29.527
Why?

1:05:29.629 --> 1:05:31.969
I made someone a promise.

1:05:32.071 --> 1:05:33.300
Alex.

1:05:33.402 --> 1:05:35.104
She wanted me out of this life.

1:05:35.206 --> 1:05:37.073
Get away, escape to Africa.

1:05:37.175 --> 1:05:39.636
Put my experience to good use,
protect the elephants.

1:05:39.738 --> 1:05:42.507
Fight the good fight.

1:05:42.609 --> 1:05:45.444
She discovered she had cancer.

1:05:45.546 --> 1:05:48.348
After she was gone, I was lost.

1:05:48.450 --> 1:05:50.317
Arnold was all I had left.

1:05:55.324 --> 1:05:57.720
I'm sorry about your wife.

1:05:58.789 --> 1:06:04.001
And I'm thankful you
let me live.

1:06:04.663 --> 1:06:07.565
But you're still a mob soldier,
and I'm still a cop.

1:06:07.667 --> 1:06:09.270
- Yeah, well,

1:06:09.372 --> 1:06:12.339
I'm afraid all I've done
is delayed the inevitable.

1:06:12.441 --> 1:06:15.243
We're both probably
going to die tonight.

1:06:15.345 --> 1:06:17.311
- So what's
your plan, then?

1:06:17.413 --> 1:06:19.181
What, have a drink,
drown your sorrows,

1:06:19.283 --> 1:06:20.776
and wait for them
to come calling?

1:06:20.878 --> 1:06:23.581
Yeah, well, pretty much, yeah.

1:06:23.683 --> 1:06:26.254
I built this place, designed it.

1:06:26.356 --> 1:06:28.256
The walls, the furniture.

1:06:28.358 --> 1:06:31.325
Everything's reinforced
and fireproof.

1:06:31.427 --> 1:06:34.559
And Alex's bathroom
is a de facto panic room.

1:06:37.333 --> 1:06:39.333
It's a fortress.

1:06:39.435 --> 1:06:41.038
You got booby traps?

1:06:41.140 --> 1:06:43.469
I've got guns.

1:06:43.571 --> 1:06:46.142
-That's all?
-A lot of guns.

1:06:46.244 --> 1:06:47.737
And I know how to use them.

1:06:47.839 --> 1:06:51.345
Plus, those guys
are coming to me.

1:06:51.447 --> 1:06:54.216
Got home field advantage.

1:06:54.318 --> 1:06:56.680
I've killed people
for a lot less.

1:06:56.782 --> 1:07:00.354
Yeah.
You have, haven't you?

1:07:00.456 --> 1:07:02.422
Yes, I have.

1:07:02.524 --> 1:07:05.128
Let's get ready for our guests,
shall we?

1:07:05.230 --> 1:07:07.394
They'll be here soon.

1:07:07.496 --> 1:07:10.298
Nothing short of a direct hit
from an artillery round

1:07:10.400 --> 1:07:12.366
will breach this room.

1:07:12.468 --> 1:07:15.270
If things go south,
and they will,

1:07:15.372 --> 1:07:18.768
lock the door
and lay in the tub.

1:07:18.870 --> 1:07:21.375
Hiding is not my style.

1:07:21.477 --> 1:07:24.708
Sometimes it's a difference
between living and dying.

1:07:26.547 --> 1:07:29.746
Well, if shit hits the fan,
I know where to find you.

1:07:29.848 --> 1:07:31.418
Hm.

1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:33.123
In the tub.

1:07:34.588 --> 1:07:36.357
Duly noted.

1:07:39.593 --> 1:07:42.627
I don't know what happened.

1:07:42.729 --> 1:07:44.332
I mean, that fucking cop.

1:07:44.434 --> 1:07:48.303
Just get rid of them both.
Whatever the cost.

1:07:48.405 --> 1:07:51.174
Both?

1:07:51.276 --> 1:07:52.406
But he's my partner.

1:07:52.508 --> 1:07:54.540
He's one of my oldest friends.

1:07:54.642 --> 1:07:57.411
I got no choice.

1:07:57.513 --> 1:08:00.150
I mean, is this even worth it?

1:08:00.252 --> 1:08:02.581
Survival of the fittest.

1:08:02.683 --> 1:08:04.814
- When Gabe brought me on,

1:08:04.916 --> 1:08:08.818
I knew there'd be a day
when I'd be the one you'd call

1:08:08.920 --> 1:08:10.325
when things needed to be taken
care of.

1:08:10.427 --> 1:08:12.591
He made his choice.

1:08:12.693 --> 1:08:14.725
Now you make yours.

1:08:17.565 --> 1:08:19.334
You got it, boss.

1:08:36.617 --> 1:08:39.651
A bunch of serious
looking assholes.

1:08:39.753 --> 1:08:43.754
And a guy with
a porn star mustache.

1:08:43.856 --> 1:08:45.459
- LaFontaine.

1:08:45.561 --> 1:08:46.889
Open the damn door, Gabe!

1:08:46.991 --> 1:08:48.363
- He dangerous?

1:08:48.465 --> 1:08:51.465
Could use a better
deodorant maybe.

1:08:51.567 --> 1:08:53.236
Come on.

1:08:53.338 --> 1:08:54.930
I ain't got time
for this horseshit.

1:08:55.032 --> 1:08:57.702
Don't nobody do nothing
unless I say.

1:09:14.325 --> 1:09:17.227
Gabe, I'm taking
that lady cop back

1:09:17.329 --> 1:09:19.262
to Mr. Solomon.

1:09:19.364 --> 1:09:21.561
With or without your consent.

1:09:22.828 --> 1:09:24.762
- Just like that, huh?

1:09:24.864 --> 1:09:27.402
- Yep.

1:09:27.504 --> 1:09:29.338
So, what's it gonna be?

1:09:30.770 --> 1:09:33.276
So let me get this straight.

1:09:35.709 --> 1:09:38.743
I let you take her,

1:09:38.845 --> 1:09:40.514
I go free.

1:09:40.616 --> 1:09:42.681
Sure, Gabe.

1:09:42.783 --> 1:09:45.387
For old times' sake.

1:09:45.489 --> 1:09:47.290
Okay.

1:09:47.392 --> 1:09:50.359
Sounds like a good deal.

1:09:50.461 --> 1:09:52.526
For old times' sake.

1:10:09.039 --> 1:10:11.677
You done fucked up now, Gabe.

1:10:11.779 --> 1:10:14.317
Perhaps.

1:10:17.917 --> 1:10:19.388
It'll take them
a while to regroup,

1:10:19.490 --> 1:10:21.390
but they'll be back.

1:10:26.089 --> 1:10:28.991
- You had it good
for a while, didn't you?

1:10:29.093 --> 1:10:31.796
Cars, big house in the country.

1:10:31.898 --> 1:10:34.502
Plenty of money
to save lots of elephants.

1:10:34.604 --> 1:10:35.833
I'm guessing
your wife never knew

1:10:35.935 --> 1:10:38.033
where it all really
came from until she did.

1:10:38.135 --> 1:10:40.310
And that's when you had
to make your promise.

1:10:40.412 --> 1:10:41.707
Jealous?

1:10:43.447 --> 1:10:46.008
I sleep soundly knowing
I put away the bad guys.

1:10:46.110 --> 1:10:49.880
Well, I guess there's no softer
pillow than a clear conscience.

1:10:52.456 --> 1:10:57.657
One time,
a meth dealer on the east side.

1:10:57.759 --> 1:11:02.596
We served a warrant and kicked
in his door at- 00 a.m.

1:11:02.698 --> 1:11:06.468
He had three kids. Daughters.

1:11:06.570 --> 1:11:08.470
What he made them do.

1:11:08.572 --> 1:11:11.638
Parents are supposed
to protect their children.

1:11:11.740 --> 1:11:14.443
I drew down on him.

1:11:14.545 --> 1:11:17.974
Not an officer
there would have talked.

1:11:18.076 --> 1:11:21.076
So, what did you end up doing?

1:11:22.585 --> 1:11:26.488
I called CPS and arrested him.

1:11:27.392 --> 1:11:29.458
I believe in the law, Gabriel.

1:11:32.991 --> 1:11:36.465
I guess that's why
you're a better person than me.

1:11:36.567 --> 1:11:38.434
Just like my Alex.

1:11:42.704 --> 1:11:44.605
The guy we're waiting for,
how good is he?

1:11:44.707 --> 1:11:47.410
- He thinks
he's as good as I am.

1:11:48.974 --> 1:11:50.039
He is younger.

1:11:50.141 --> 1:11:51.414
Mm.

1:11:51.516 --> 1:11:53.042
Not very reassuring.

1:11:53.144 --> 1:11:55.418
Yeah, well,
it wasn't meant to be.

1:11:55.520 --> 1:11:58.454
What if he's better than you?

1:12:00.821 --> 1:12:02.590
Bath time.

1:12:04.990 --> 1:12:06.891
Because you'll be next.

1:13:44.155 --> 1:13:45.990
Mind if I come in?

1:13:46.092 --> 1:13:49.499
I've asked him for five minutes
to talk to you.

1:13:49.601 --> 1:13:51.160
You owe me that.

1:13:51.262 --> 1:13:53.701
Come on.

1:13:56.134 --> 1:13:58.068
I got it.

1:14:34.877 --> 1:14:39.076
Some people claim
there's a woman to blame.

1:14:40.816 --> 1:14:42.948
But I know...

1:14:43.918 --> 1:14:45.852
...it's my own damn fault.

1:15:06.974 --> 1:15:09.271
Caused a lot of trouble,
senorita.

1:15:11.374 --> 1:15:14.111
You sure you want this?

1:15:14.213 --> 1:15:16.212
What's done is done.

1:15:16.314 --> 1:15:17.719
We have five minutes before

1:15:17.821 --> 1:15:19.688
those guys come
storming up in here.

1:15:19.790 --> 1:15:22.790
Ex-agency shooters,
SX contractors.

1:15:22.892 --> 1:15:24.319
You know, the real deal.

1:15:24.421 --> 1:15:26.090
I'm sure you'll tag
some of them,

1:15:26.192 --> 1:15:29.291
but they'll get the job done.

1:15:35.266 --> 1:15:37.739
Why are you doing this?

1:15:37.841 --> 1:15:39.609
She's no one!

1:15:41.976 --> 1:15:44.075
Man, don't make me kill you.

1:15:47.014 --> 1:15:49.344
You're assuming a lot.

1:15:56.122 --> 1:15:58.859
Like a fucking western, huh?

1:15:58.961 --> 1:16:02.764
Like a fucking western.

1:16:05.769 --> 1:16:07.362
Love it.

1:16:35.260 --> 1:16:38.162
I'm much younger than you.

1:16:38.264 --> 1:16:39.999
Much faster.

1:16:40.430 --> 1:16:42.903
Better looking for sure.

1:16:43.005 --> 1:16:46.038
I'm ruthless.

1:16:46.140 --> 1:16:48.238
I can kill you in a heartbeat.

1:17:33.450 --> 1:17:35.252
What a waste.

1:17:43.801 --> 1:17:45.394
- It's time.

1:18:11.928 --> 1:18:14.192
Solomon's not paying you enough!

1:18:14.294 --> 1:18:17.294
Go home!
Live to fight another day.

1:18:17.396 --> 1:18:20.396
Any of you fuckers want
to leave, I'll kill you myself.

1:18:20.498 --> 1:18:24.169
Our mission is to take
this motherfucker out!

1:18:24.271 --> 1:18:25.973
None of you get paid --

1:19:11.153 --> 1:19:12.382
I'll go.

1:19:12.484 --> 1:19:13.856
I can cover the driveway.

1:19:13.958 --> 1:19:15.352
Go! Go ahead!

1:19:15.454 --> 1:19:17.222
Go! Go! Go!

1:19:50.389 --> 1:19:52.059
Ah!

1:20:05.041 --> 1:20:07.041
I thought you said this house
was impenetrable.

1:20:07.143 --> 1:20:08.537
- Well,
I thought so, too.

1:20:08.639 --> 1:20:12.508
I'm a contractor killer,
not a contract builder, okay?

1:20:18.648 --> 1:20:22.991
This doesn't look good.

1:20:24.522 --> 1:20:27.325
Come on! Take that out now!

1:20:29.164 --> 1:20:31.296
Time for me to get
some fresh air.

1:20:37.172 --> 1:20:39.106
Bath time.

1:20:40.703 --> 1:20:42.439
There you go.

1:20:43.211 --> 1:20:45.607
Stay hydrated.

1:22:40.559 --> 1:22:43.329
- Over here!
Behind the truck.

1:23:29.377 --> 1:23:31.113
Aaah!

1:24:25.763 --> 1:24:27.565
- Jesus Christ.

1:24:29.701 --> 1:24:35.309
Men that work for me
must be capable of violence.

1:24:35.872 --> 1:24:41.117
And also understand the power
of a well-placed threat.

1:24:41.219 --> 1:24:42.712
Yes, sir.

1:24:44.683 --> 1:24:45.682
Marine Corps?

1:24:45.784 --> 1:24:47.783
Navy. SEAL Team 4.

1:24:47.885 --> 1:24:49.752
- I need new shooters.

1:24:49.854 --> 1:24:52.194
My last guy moved on.

1:24:52.296 --> 1:24:53.789
Won't let you down.

1:24:59.566 --> 1:25:01.665
This is for Luis Velasquez.

1:25:37.835 --> 1:25:39.604
Do me a favor.

1:25:41.608 --> 1:25:43.806
Take care of this for me.

1:25:47.746 --> 1:25:50.417
Sure, I'll do that.

1:25:51.651 --> 1:25:53.321
Hey.

1:25:53.423 --> 1:25:54.916
I got your back.

1:26:47.938 --> 1:26:49.773
- You alright, Gabe?

1:26:51.810 --> 1:26:53.909
Yeah, man, I'm good.

1:27:20.037 --> 1:27:22.476
-You okay?
-All good, all good.

1:27:22.578 --> 1:27:24.808
Come on, guys.
Let's get it done.
