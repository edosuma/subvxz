08:45.462 --> 08:46.462
Oh, you’re having a hard time?

08:46.462 --> 08:49.066
Do you see what I’m doing here?
Do you see my hand?

08:49.066 --> 08:50.297
This gesture says that I’m in

08:50.297 --> 08:53.264
a domestic abuse situation
\hand you’re doing nothing.

08:53.264 --> 08:54.363
You’re just standing there

08:54.363 --> 08:56.429
\hnot even telling me
what you’re selling.

08:56.429 --> 08:58.396
-Taffy!
-Wrong!

09:01.165 --> 09:02.495
So, Mom, did you ever find out

09:02.495 --> 09:05.264
what was stolen from
that Nantucket house?

09:05.264 --> 09:07.264
-I did. Funny story.
\h\h\h\h\h-Never is.

09:07.264 --> 09:11.264
\hIt was a bottle of shampoo
I must have packed in my bag.

09:11.264 --> 09:13.132
Oh, no way.

09:13.132 --> 09:14.759
You did it?
\h(laughs)

09:14.759 --> 09:16.627
How does your fat foot taste,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hMom?

09:16.627 --> 09:20.396
Apparently taking the rest
of a tiny bottle of shampoo

09:20.396 --> 09:22.165
is considered stealing nowadays.

09:22.165 --> 09:24.561
Answer the question
\h\habout the foot.

09:24.561 --> 09:27.033
-How big was the bottle?
\h\h\h-Ah, it was small.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.462
I thought you said
\h\hit was "tiny."

09:28.462 --> 09:30.165
\h\h\h\h\h\hWould it pass
through airport security?

09:30.165 --> 09:33.000
-That’s the threshold.
\h-It was very little.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.297
Oh, now it’s "little."

09:34.297 --> 09:36.363
You’re all over the place.

09:36.363 --> 09:37.264
May we see the bottle?

09:37.264 --> 09:38.759
\h\h\h\h\hI would love
to show you the bottle.

09:38.759 --> 09:41.759
\h\h\h\hThen you’ll see
how ridiculous this is.

09:41.759 --> 09:45.099
Okay, so this dinner’s not one
\h\hof her best efforts, right?

09:45.099 --> 09:46.363
-Big whiff.
\h-I agree.

09:46.363 --> 09:48.726
Okay, let’s pile that on, too.

09:48.726 --> 09:51.033
-(bottle thuds)
\h\h\h\h\h-Yo!

09:51.033 --> 09:53.099
That’s borderline huge, Mom.

09:53.099 --> 09:54.528
The size is misleading.

09:54.528 --> 09:56.759
\h\h\hThere was barely
any liquid left in it.

09:56.759 --> 09:58.132
It was sputtering to a finish.

09:58.132 --> 10:01.099
It made an audible thud
\hwhen you put it down.

10:01.099 --> 10:02.627
I hated tonight’s chicken.

10:02.627 --> 10:04.297
I am not wrong here, okay?

10:04.297 --> 10:06.132
We paid a lot of money
\h\h\h\hfor that house,

10:06.132 --> 10:08.099
and taking the ass-end
\h\hof a shampoo bottle

10:08.099 --> 10:09.495
barely makes a dent
\hinto their haul.

10:09.495 --> 10:12.627
There, definitive proof that
your mother always describes

10:12.627 --> 10:16.462
big things as being smaller
\h\h\h\h\h\hthan they are.

10:16.693 --> 10:18.132
Did you hear that, Chris?

10:18.132 --> 10:20.033
We’ve all seen it, Dad.

10:20.033 --> 10:21.528
Aw.

10:25.693 --> 10:27.033
Good afternoon, Mr. Quagmire.

10:27.033 --> 10:29.660
\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, salesmen. Look,
I’m gonna be straight with you.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.528
You see this coin purse?
\h\h\h\hIt contains $87,

10:32.528 --> 10:34.363
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hwhich is
what I allow myself to spend

10:34.363 --> 10:36.396
on superfluous purchases
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hevery week.

10:36.396 --> 10:38.330
It is currently open.

10:38.330 --> 10:39.198
Just like my ears.

10:39.198 --> 10:42.198
If you wow me with your pitch,
\h\h\h\h\h\hthe money is yours.

10:42.198 --> 10:44.429
\h\h\h\h\hIf it closes,
you have lost the sale.

10:44.429 --> 10:45.726
Now let’s hear it.

10:45.726 --> 10:47.660
So...

10:48.561 --> 10:51.693
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAs you can see,
we have all the classic flavors.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.429
It’s like a vacation in a box.

10:53.429 --> 10:56.693
\hAll the fun of the beach
without that pesky commute.

10:56.693 --> 10:58.297
I don’t know. I only like taffy

10:58.297 --> 11:00.132
\hwhen it’s got cute,
little jokes in ’em.

11:00.132 --> 11:03.396
\h\hSomething to laugh at while
you’re doing all that chewing.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.132
Who doesn’t love laughing?

11:05.132 --> 11:07.495
That’s why our taffy comes
\h\h\h\h\hwith jokes, too.

11:07.495 --> 11:10.726
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-It does?
\h\h\h-This is Brian’s
personal phone number.

11:10.726 --> 11:12.198
Every time you eat a taffy,

11:12.198 --> 11:15.099
\h\h\h\h\hcall that number
and he’ll tell you a joke.

11:15.099 --> 11:16.759
(crickets chirping)

11:16.759 --> 11:19.462
(phone buzzes)

11:19.462 --> 11:21.330
(grunts)
\hHello.

11:21.330 --> 11:23.495
Hi, I’m eating my taffy.

11:23.495 --> 11:25.330
Oh, what time is it?

11:25.330 --> 11:26.594
Very late. I work nights.

11:26.594 --> 11:30.396
\h\hAnd I like to have a treat
while I watch my infomercials.

11:30.396 --> 11:31.759
Joke, please.

11:31.759 --> 11:33.594
Oh, okay, um, uh...

11:33.594 --> 11:36.132
what, uh... why-why did the...

11:36.132 --> 11:38.132
house go to the doctor?

11:38.132 --> 11:40.231
Because it had window panes.

11:40.231 --> 11:43.099
\h\h\h\h(laughs)
Oh, that’s good.

11:43.099 --> 11:44.759
I’m-a call you again
\h\h\hin ten minutes

11:44.759 --> 11:47.528
when I have another piece.

11:48.396 --> 11:49.396
(phone buzzes)

11:49.396 --> 11:53.330
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-Yup.
-I swallowed quicker
\h\h\hthan I thought.

11:56.297 --> 11:59.033
\h\h\h\h\hDo you know how awful
it feels to be labeled a thief

11:59.033 --> 12:02.396
\h\h\hfor something as silly
as a small bottle of shampoo?

12:02.396 --> 12:04.264
\hYeah.
(gulps)

12:04.264 --> 12:06.726
I heard the bottle wasn’t
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hthat small.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.693
What? Where did you hear that?

12:08.693 --> 12:11.198
\h\h\hJoe and I have
eerily quiet dinners.

12:11.198 --> 12:14.297
\h\h\h\h\h\hWe can hear all
your family’s conversation.

12:14.297 --> 12:16.132
Mm-hmm, okay.

12:16.132 --> 12:20.297
\hYou know, I’m gonna get
a knife for this cheese.

12:22.099 --> 12:24.198
Oh, let me get that for you.

12:24.198 --> 12:25.660
They’re my grandmother’s knives,

12:25.660 --> 12:29.297
\h\h\h\h\hso I’m gonna need you
to sign out which one you use.

12:29.297 --> 12:30.528
Okay, that’s enough.

12:30.528 --> 12:32.627
I see what’s happening here.

12:32.627 --> 12:33.627
You think I’m a thief.

12:33.627 --> 12:36.066
\h\h\h\hI can’t believe
you’re not on my side.

12:36.066 --> 12:37.330
I heard the bottle had a pump.

12:37.330 --> 12:39.759
A pump? Who else are you
\htalking to about this?

12:39.759 --> 12:43.594
I’m on a couple of text chains
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hdiscussing it.

12:43.594 --> 12:45.264
Oh, God!

12:45.264 --> 12:46.429
Okay, I got to fix this.

12:46.429 --> 12:49.132
I am bringing that shampoo
\h\h\h\hback to Nantucket.

12:49.132 --> 12:51.594
It’s the only way.

12:52.198 --> 12:54.165
\h\hJOE:
Pockets.

12:57.363 --> 12:59.759
\h\h\hDid you come in
with this ChapStick?

12:59.759 --> 13:00.759
Yes.

13:00.759 --> 13:03.759
I’ll, uh, check the tape.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.297
(rings)

13:10.297 --> 13:13.000
\hOh, thanks for agreeing
to meet me here, Dottie.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.330
\h\h\h\h\h\hOf course,
Bell over the Door Café

13:15.330 --> 13:17.594
has the best coffee
\h\hon the island.

13:17.594 --> 13:18.429
(bell rings)

13:18.429 --> 13:20.462
\h\h\hYou know, I wanted
to clear the air with you

13:20.462 --> 13:21.726
about that bottle of shampoo.

13:21.726 --> 13:25.066
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hIt turns out
we did take it by mistake.

13:25.066 --> 13:26.561
I-I feel terrible,

13:26.561 --> 13:30.099
so I wanted to return it
\h\h\hto you personally.

13:30.099 --> 13:32.330
-(bottle thuds)
-(crowd gasps)

13:32.330 --> 13:33.132
That’s so nice.

13:33.132 --> 13:34.561
\h\h\h\hYou didn’t have
to drive all this way.

13:34.561 --> 13:36.726
\hI mean, you could have
just put it in the mail.

13:36.726 --> 13:39.231
Oh, no, the mail is
\h\hso impersonal.

13:39.231 --> 13:41.759
\h\hIt was important
I did this in person.

13:41.759 --> 13:44.033
Well, thank you again.

13:44.033 --> 13:45.264
(bell rings)

13:45.264 --> 13:47.066
So, now that this is settled,

13:47.066 --> 13:50.759
\h\h\h\hI was thinking maybe
you could change your review.

13:50.759 --> 13:53.000
Oh. I’m sorry, no.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.231
I can’t do that.

13:54.231 --> 13:55.759
\h(laughs):
Oh, but...

13:55.759 --> 13:57.495
but I returned the bottle.

13:57.495 --> 14:00.099
\h\h\h\h\h\hLois, I write
the reviews of my guests

14:00.099 --> 14:03.330
\hbased on their behavior
while they’re in my home.

14:03.330 --> 14:05.528
And you stole the shampoo.

14:05.528 --> 14:08.033
And you only brought it back
\h\h\hbecause you got caught.

14:08.033 --> 14:10.396
\h\h\h\h\h\hSo if anything,
you’re proving what I wrote

14:10.396 --> 14:13.693
about you was correct.

14:15.033 --> 14:17.330
Dottie. Dot.

14:17.330 --> 14:18.033
D.

14:18.033 --> 14:19.660
Look, I am on my back here.

14:19.660 --> 14:21.462
My legs are in the stirrups,

14:21.462 --> 14:22.726
forceps have been utilized,

14:22.726 --> 14:24.495
there was some sort of suction,
and still

14:24.495 --> 14:27.066
\h-that’s not enough?
-I’m not changing it.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.231
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h-(bell rings)
-Can we turn that bell off?!

14:29.231 --> 14:31.165
\h\h\h\h\hThat bell was
the only item recovered

14:31.165 --> 14:33.495
\h\h\h\h\hfrom a shipwreck
that devastated our island.

14:33.495 --> 14:35.660
Entire families were torn apart,
and...

14:35.660 --> 14:37.561
\h\h\h\h\h(chuckles)
Why am I telling you?

\h\h\h\h\h\h\has something

17:13.066 --> 17:14.396
people actually want.

17:14.396 --> 17:15.759
Let’s brainstorm.

17:15.759 --> 17:17.660
Okay. Hmm.

17:17.660 --> 17:21.165
\hYou know, I’m-I’m really not
liking your brainstorming face.

17:21.165 --> 17:23.462
Very unlikable eyebrow movement.

17:23.462 --> 17:25.000
Shh! I got it, I got it.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.429
Colored layered sand in bottles.

17:27.429 --> 17:29.495
That’s a whole different
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hbad idea.

17:29.495 --> 17:32.759
Okay, what about bottles
\hwith layered sand in it

17:32.759 --> 17:34.165
that’s different colors?

17:34.165 --> 17:36.264
That’s the same thing
except with the words

17:36.264 --> 17:37.231
in a different order.

17:37.231 --> 17:38.561
We’re never gonna sell
\h\h\h\hall this stuff

17:38.561 --> 17:40.594
\h\h\h\h\hunless we can find
a big enough group of suckers

17:40.594 --> 17:43.759
to trick into taking it
\h\h\h\hoff our hands.

17:48.660 --> 17:50.264
Welp, we found ’em!

17:50.264 --> 17:52.000
Stewie, rebranding this taffy

17:52.000 --> 17:54.231
\h\h\h\h\has Chew Anon
was a stroke of genius.

17:54.231 --> 17:56.198
Yep, and when we told Joe Rogan

17:56.198 --> 17:57.660
it cured COVID, we were off.

17:57.660 --> 18:02.198
God bless our stupid,
\h\h\hstupid country.

18:04.297 --> 18:06.759
(thunder crashes)

18:13.198 --> 18:15.297
Hello, Dottie.

18:15.297 --> 18:18.000
Lois? What are you doing here?

18:18.000 --> 18:20.198
Well, I brought your dinner.

18:20.198 --> 18:22.693
And... delivery complete.

18:22.693 --> 18:24.297
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hOh, well,
would you look at that.

18:24.297 --> 18:27.066
It looks like it’s my turn
\hto give someone a review.

18:27.066 --> 18:27.660
What?

18:27.660 --> 18:30.000
After every delivery,
\hdrivers get to rate

18:30.000 --> 18:32.363
\htheir experience
with the customer.

18:32.363 --> 18:34.033
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h(gasps)
Wouldn’t it be a shame

18:34.033 --> 18:36.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hif one
of only two DoorDash drivers

18:36.165 --> 18:40.297
\h\h\h\h\hon the island
gave you a poor review?

18:40.462 --> 18:43.726
(gasps) Well, they might ban
\h\hyou from the app, Dottie.

18:43.726 --> 18:46.066
You might actually have
\h\hto leave the house

18:46.066 --> 18:49.165
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hfor food
during the winter season.

18:51.396 --> 18:53.165
Okay, what do you want, money?

18:53.165 --> 18:54.132
No, no, no, no, no.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.099
Here’s what’s gonna happen,
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hDottie.

18:56.099 --> 18:58.330
\h\h\h\hYou’re gonna
take out your phone,

18:58.330 --> 18:59.759
open up Airbnb,

18:59.759 --> 19:02.165
then change that review.

19:02.165 --> 19:03.198
Okay.

19:03.198 --> 19:05.396
Type the following: "Would."

19:05.396 --> 19:07.561
-Would...
-"Host."

19:07.561 --> 19:09.726
\h-Host.
-"Again."

19:09.726 --> 19:11.726
-Again.
-Send.

19:11.726 --> 19:13.099
So that’s it?

19:13.099 --> 19:14.627
-This is over?
\h\h-That’s it.

19:14.627 --> 19:16.726
This is over.

19:16.726 --> 19:19.099
You know what, Dottie?

19:19.099 --> 19:21.033
I did steal that shampoo.

19:21.033 --> 19:22.165
You did?

19:22.165 --> 19:23.033
You’re damn right I did!

19:23.033 --> 19:25.495
I was always gonna
steal that shampoo.

19:25.495 --> 19:26.594
And do you know why?

19:26.594 --> 19:28.132
Because when I stood
\h\h\hin your shower

19:28.132 --> 19:30.396
\h\h\h\h\h\h\hand rubbed that
peach orchard-scented bottle

19:30.396 --> 19:33.495
\h\hof bliss into my hair,
I felt like somebody else.

19:33.495 --> 19:35.495
I felt like somebody
\h\h\h\hwho mattered.

19:35.495 --> 19:37.528
Somebody who had enough
\h\h\h\hdisposable cash

19:37.528 --> 19:40.363
that she could buy
a scented shampoo.

19:40.363 --> 19:42.066
That’s what Airbnbs do, Dottie.

19:42.066 --> 19:45.495
\h\h\h\h\hThey make you feel like
you’re living a fairy tale life.

19:45.495 --> 19:48.297
\h\h\h\hAnd I wanted
that feeling to last.

19:48.297 --> 19:49.462
And it did!

19:49.462 --> 19:51.627
\h\hAlso, I opened
your locked closet

19:51.627 --> 19:54.429
and put on your wedding dress.
\h\h\h\h\h\hI ate yogurt in it.

19:54.429 --> 19:56.066
Oh, my God.

19:56.066 --> 19:57.198
Yeah, oh, my God.

19:57.198 --> 19:58.693
\h\h\h\hBecause that’s
what Lois Griffin does.

19:58.693 --> 20:02.297
Really, I should be thanking you
for reminding me of who I am:

20:02.297 --> 20:05.231
\ha secret little psycho
with very little to lose.

20:05.231 --> 20:06.693
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hAnd there’s
a million of us out there,

20:06.693 --> 20:09.495
and you’re just welcoming
\hus all into your homes.

20:09.495 --> 20:11.561
So if you ever think
\h\hof giving someone

20:11.561 --> 20:15.099
a bad review again,
\h\hremember this.

20:15.396 --> 20:18.726
We know where you live.

20:19.264 --> 20:21.726
\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\h\hANNOUNCER:
Airbnb. What are you doing?!

20:21.726 --> 20:24.099
It’s your house!

20:31.693 --> 20:33.627
Well, it all worked out.

20:33.627 --> 20:34.231
What?

20:34.231 --> 20:35.561
Oh, I said it all worked out.

20:35.561 --> 20:38.264
I got my reputation
\h\hback on Airbnb,

20:38.264 --> 20:39.594
and Dottie got her comeuppance.

20:39.594 --> 20:42.726
\h\h\h\hI don’t know what you’re
talking about, and I don’t care.

20:42.726 --> 20:44.594
Oh. I just thought
\h\hwe could share

20:44.594 --> 20:46.396
some conversation
to pass the time.

20:46.396 --> 20:49.000
You’re the lady who yelled
\hat me in the coffee shop.

20:49.000 --> 20:53.198
\h\h\h\hYou think I give a crap
about anything you have to say?

20:53.198 --> 20:56.264
Kind of thought you’d have
a helicopter, James Taylor.

20:56.264 --> 20:59.627
Carly got it in the divorce.
