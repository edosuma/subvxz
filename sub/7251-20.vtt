00:31.297 --> 00:31.934
Hello?

00:32.128 --> 00:33.424
- They know. 
- Who knows?

00:33.538 --> 00:36.835
The cats -- they know that I've broken up with Jason and that I'm alone

00:36.930 --> 00:39.174
and they've decided it's time for me to become a crazy cat lady.

00:39.250 --> 00:41.641
- What are you talking about? 
- There's a cat on my doorstep.

00:41.703 --> 00:43.418
Well, that's better than a bun in your oven.

00:43.505 --> 00:45.049
It's just sitting there, staring at me,

00:45.124 --> 00:46.327
like he knew this moment was coming.

00:46.515 --> 00:47.704
It's still there. Why is it still there?

00:47.837 --> 00:51.422
Mom, it's a stray. It's passing through. It's hanging out. Relax.

00:51.574 --> 00:54.119
Move away from the window and go back to bed.

00:54.211 --> 00:56.546
It's not fair. We just broke up. It just happened.

00:56.597 --> 00:59.972
I'm still young. It's still possible that I'm gonna have a successful relationship.

01:00.054 --> 01:03.017
- You don't know. My eggs are still viable. 
- Are you yelling at me or the cat?

01:03.126 --> 01:05.579
The cat. I think he flipped me off with his tail. I'm Babette.

01:05.674 --> 01:07.447
- Babette's not single. 
- Whose side are you on?

01:07.507 --> 01:08.828
- Circle the wagons. 
- Sorry.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.810
Everyone knows. They can see it in my face.

01:10.979 --> 01:13.483
"She's single again. She couldn't make it work again.

01:13.570 --> 01:16.586
She picked the wrong guy again." Hey, do not lick yourself in front of me.

01:16.663 --> 01:19.750
Mom, I need you to get a grip. You're tired, you're stressed out,

01:19.796 --> 01:22.136
- and you're not seeing things clearly. 
- Oh, my God!

01:22.274 --> 01:23.723
- What? 
- There are two of them.

01:23.815 --> 01:26.944
- They're not even easing me into this, those bastards. 
- I give up.

01:27.015 --> 01:29.898
I guess I need to start collecting newspapers and magazines,

01:29.969 --> 01:32.248
find a blue bathrobe, lose my front teeth.

01:32.337 --> 01:35.606
Well, obviously, you've got a busy day ahead of you, so I'm gonna let you go.

01:35.677 --> 01:37.736
Yarn balls. I need to find some yarn balls.

01:37.819 --> 01:38.304
Bye.

01:40.609 --> 01:42.939
Hey, I am a young, desirable woman.

01:50.808 --> 02:54.011
Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve.

03:04.087 --> 03:06.580
Sylvie, horse feed. Jackson, garden stone.

03:06.626 --> 03:08.741
Sookie, too much salt in gazpacho.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.489
Oh, boy.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.352
- What are you doing? 
- I need coffee.

03:27.546 --> 03:29.451
It's 5:00 in the morning. Make coffee at your own house.

03:29.528 --> 03:30.598
I did. I drank it all.

03:30.992 --> 03:33.501
You drank all the coffee in your house before five in the morning?

03:33.701 --> 03:35.498
- Big gulps, lots of sugar. 
- Alright, get up.

03:36.009 --> 03:38.125
And just a little bit of cream 'cause it makes it cold.

03:38.272 --> 03:38.928
Keep moving.

03:40.251 --> 03:43.264
I can't sleep. I can't turn my mind off.

03:43.340 --> 03:45.389
It keeps running and thinking and making lists.

03:45.978 --> 03:49.164
Maybe if you drank a little less coffee, you'd make a little less lists.

03:49.225 --> 03:51.744
Oh, I can't stop drinking the coffee. I stop drinking coffee,

03:51.805 --> 03:56.491
I stop doing the standing and walking and the words putting-into-sentence doing.

03:56.649 --> 03:57.785
I'll make you some coffee.

03:59.287 --> 04:04.032
If I could move, I would hug you. In fact, in my mind, I am hugging you,

04:04.196 --> 04:07.851
and also, I'm telling the plumbers that there's no water pressure in rooms 10, 12, and 15.

04:08.077 --> 04:10.206
- I'm making you some oatmeal. 
- I don't like oatmeal.

04:10.267 --> 04:11.507
You've got to eat something healthy.

04:11.604 --> 04:13.575
Oh, man, I'm so completely stressed.

04:13.647 --> 04:15.906
I can't remember what I'm doing from one moment to the next.

04:16.007 --> 04:17.732
- It's never gonna get done. 
- It will get done.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.211
No, it won't get done, and the inn won't open,

04:20.267 --> 04:21.736
and then I'll go broke. How do you do it?

04:21.825 --> 04:22.654
Do what? Go broke?

04:22.745 --> 04:24.758
No -- run this place, handle all the stress?

04:24.844 --> 04:26.559
- The place isn't stressful. 
- It's not?

04:26.631 --> 04:28.695
Well, actually, at this moment, it is a little.

04:30.374 --> 04:33.150
Maybe I can't handle it. Do you think I can handle it?

04:33.237 --> 04:34.762
- I already told you you could handle it. 
- When?

04:34.819 --> 04:36.816
- Quite a while ago. 
- Did I believe you?

04:37.246 --> 04:38.673
Apparently, you didn't even listen to me.

04:38.889 --> 04:40.994
Oh, hey. I want you to take a tour of the inn.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.896
Why don't I just wait till the place is repossessed? Then I can see it at public auction.

04:44.025 --> 04:46.676
How can you be so mean to me when I only managed to line one of my eyes?

04:46.805 --> 04:47.521
I apologize.

04:47.680 --> 04:50.829
Seriously, I want to give you an official investors tour.

04:50.885 --> 04:52.207
You should see the place. It's looking really good.

04:52.284 --> 04:55.657
I heard the water pressure sucks in rooms 10, 12, and 15.

04:55.745 --> 04:57.725
- What do you say? 
- You eat the oatmeal, I'll take the tour.

04:57.853 --> 05:00.767
Fine, I'll eat it. But I'm making a face the entire time.

05:00.838 --> 05:01.893
Looking forward to it.

05:04.258 --> 05:05.032
Oh, hey, Kirk.

05:12.220 --> 05:12.988
Something wrong?

05:13.516 --> 05:15.507
- I wanted to sit there. 
- Seriously?

05:15.646 --> 05:18.016
Of course seriously. Why do you think I'm here this early?

05:18.078 --> 05:19.255
I wanted to get that table.

05:19.388 --> 05:21.426
Every single other table in here is empty.

05:21.488 --> 05:22.450
Except the one I want.

05:23.603 --> 05:24.207
Fine.

05:24.786 --> 05:26.962
You have to understand that on days when Lulu is working,

05:27.058 --> 05:29.183
- I have very little in my life. 
- I know, Kirk.

05:29.316 --> 05:32.470
This table is a small thing, but it makes me happy.

05:32.563 --> 05:34.216
It gives me a sense of power over my life,

05:34.462 --> 05:37.294
a little control in a world where very little is controllable.

05:37.412 --> 05:38.599
- Kirk. 
- What?

05:38.731 --> 05:39.864
I moved. Your table's free.

05:40.350 --> 05:42.193
Oh. Well... thanks.

05:43.279 --> 05:43.944
You're welcome.

05:45.291 --> 05:46.867
Boy, the light over here is excellent.

05:50.207 --> 05:51.587
Is this your voice?

05:52.152 --> 05:55.280
Michel, curtains. Tom, banister and mud-sink valve.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.768
Yes, that's my voice. I left myself a couple of messages last night.

05:57.862 --> 06:00.513
You left yourself 25 messages last night,

06:00.641 --> 06:04.251
and the funny thing is, you didn't listen to any of the messages.

06:04.342 --> 06:07.384
- I listened to the messages. 
- Just hand them to me, please.

06:07.465 --> 06:10.097
Every day that you breathe, you make my life harder.

06:10.149 --> 06:13.378
- Got a solution for you, Michel. 
- And when is the desk coming?

06:13.656 --> 06:17.409
I don't find the whole conducting-business-on-the-floor thing amusing anymore!

06:17.596 --> 06:22.016
I want a desk and a chair and a bell.

06:22.104 --> 06:23.475
Where the hell is my bell?!

06:23.981 --> 06:25.775
Hi. You came by.

06:26.169 --> 06:28.473
- You told me I had to. 
- I'm so glad you're here.

06:29.031 --> 06:31.525
Wow. The staircase is beautiful.

06:32.064 --> 06:33.153
- Hey, Tom. 
- Luke.

06:33.295 --> 06:34.530
Yeah, nice work here.

06:34.714 --> 06:38.667
- But you used glue. I thought with a banister... 
- Oh, are you gonna kibitz?

06:38.826 --> 06:39.164
What?

06:39.302 --> 06:41.590
Guys who know a little about construction -- they build a birdbath,

06:41.652 --> 06:43.679
install a towel bar -- makes them think they know something,

06:43.746 --> 06:46.788
so they come in, they kibitz, offer a lot of free advice on things

06:46.859 --> 06:49.399
they don't know anything about. I got a low tolerance for that right now.

06:49.491 --> 06:52.676
- I'm not gonna kibitz. 
- Okay. And stop touching my banister.

06:54.366 --> 06:55.640
He won't let me touch the banister either.

06:55.921 --> 06:58.282
Hey, you want to see the kitchen? The stove is a thing of beauty.

06:58.364 --> 07:00.775
We're thinking of just ordering out for everything so we never have to use it.

07:00.847 --> 07:02.978
Great idea. And I wasn't gonna kibitz.

07:03.919 --> 07:05.943
Exciting, isn't it?

07:06.233 --> 07:09.532
Ohh. Lorelai, great. I've been looking for you.

07:09.638 --> 07:11.388
- Hi, Luke. 
- Hey, Sookie.

07:11.476 --> 07:14.676
- Nice kitchen. Did you use the original tiles? 
- I don't know. Ask Tom.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.459
- Never mind. 
- What's up?

07:16.637 --> 07:19.325
Lorelai, I would like to introduce you to Shel Sausman.

07:19.422 --> 07:20.877
Shel, this is Lorelai Gilmore.

07:21.296 --> 07:24.620
- It is really nice to meet you. 
- Well, it's nice to meet you, too.

07:24.707 --> 07:27.779
- Shel is going to be our poultry supplier. 
- Oh, that's great.

07:27.962 --> 07:31.751
He sells only free-range, hormone-free, and he's recently divorced.

07:31.895 --> 07:34.706
Oh, well, I assume that one doesn't have anything to do with the other.

07:35.819 --> 07:38.280
You're funny. She's funny.

07:39.044 --> 07:41.049
You know, they say pretty women usually aren't funny

07:41.111 --> 07:43.512
because they never had to be. Were you a fat child?

07:44.353 --> 07:47.496
I'm gonna go out and check with Michel on something,

07:47.623 --> 07:49.964
and you guys just talk till I get back.

07:50.143 --> 07:51.561
Hey, what do you need to talk to Michel about?

07:51.775 --> 07:53.461
- Tablecloth supplies. 
- I can do that.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.754
Michel likes me better. Talk! Just talk!

07:55.934 --> 07:58.340
- Listen, Lorelai... 
- Shel, have you met Luke?

07:59.318 --> 08:00.960
Hey, Luke... Get up!

08:02.149 --> 08:05.180
- Shel, this is Luke. 
- Nice to meet you.

08:05.309 --> 08:07.976
- Yeah, you too. 
- Luke is my... special friend.

08:08.745 --> 08:13.368
I have to tell you, renovating this place has been a real nightmare.

08:13.501 --> 08:17.402
I just don't know how I would have gotten through it without him.

08:17.944 --> 08:20.495
- Have I said thank you to you recently? 
- No.

08:20.695 --> 08:23.807
- Oh. Well, thank you. 
- You're welcome.

08:24.145 --> 08:27.698
Well, it was nice meeting you both. I'm just gonna go say goodbye to Sookie.

08:27.831 --> 08:29.071
- Oh. Bye, Shel. 
- Bye, Shel.

08:29.971 --> 08:31.364
- Don't touch my stomach. 
- You put my hand there.

08:31.435 --> 08:33.269
She's trying to set me up with Shel, the poultry guy?

08:33.325 --> 08:35.501
Why would she do that? I just broke up with someone.

08:35.691 --> 08:38.563
We'd been dating for a few months now.

08:38.660 --> 08:40.155
I figured there was someone in the picture.

08:40.289 --> 08:41.052
You did? How?

08:41.342 --> 08:44.308
Just clues. You know, you never dressed weather-appropriate, that kind of thing.

08:44.435 --> 08:46.540
- Well I can bundle on up now. 
- I'm sorry.

08:46.668 --> 08:48.803
- Cats came to my house today. 
- Really.

08:48.879 --> 08:51.491
Because they know I'm a loser and I'm destined to be alone.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.395
You're not destined to be alone. You have Shel.

08:54.184 --> 08:55.500
Why is it so hard?

08:55.607 --> 08:57.220
What, relationships? Look who you're asking.

08:57.359 --> 08:59.028
- At least you got married. 
- At least you had a kid.

08:59.509 --> 09:02.494
It makes me sad sometimes. Does it make you sad?

09:02.577 --> 09:04.296
I don't know. Maybe.

09:04.748 --> 09:06.739
I see Dr. Phil books in our future.

09:06.821 --> 09:09.585
Unless they stock them at Home Depot, they're not likely to cross my path.

09:09.668 --> 09:12.709
All this sad talk is putting a serious damper on my stressing.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.516
The place is great.

09:14.620 --> 09:17.010
- Do you think I can do this? 
- I already told you you can do this,

09:17.081 --> 09:19.319
and I already told you that I already told you you can do this.

09:19.426 --> 09:22.181
- You're making me long for Shel. 
- You'd never want for chicken.

09:24.367 --> 09:26.517
Isn't political writing just another form of propaganda?

09:26.552 --> 09:30.597
Absolutely not. Political writing confronts your assumptions.

09:30.652 --> 09:32.940
- Propaganda can do that. 
- No, it cannot.

09:33.066 --> 09:36.721
Propaganda merely reinforces what that person wishes to be told.

09:36.778 --> 09:38.754
That means the definition is determined by the audience.

09:38.841 --> 09:41.483
- That's one way of looking at it, yes. 
- You can't do that.

09:41.560 --> 09:43.797
You can't define literature in terms of the audience.

09:43.854 --> 09:46.470
Far be it from me to expect reason and common sense

09:46.573 --> 09:49.835
to triumph above youthful omniscience, so for today,

09:49.895 --> 09:52.056
we shall stop until next week.

09:53.520 --> 09:55.333
- Rory, hi. 
- Stop it.

09:55.471 --> 09:56.874
You know, I thought I would do some laundry tonight,

09:56.946 --> 10:00.020
and I don't quite have a full load of whites, so if you have some whites, toss them in.

10:00.217 --> 10:02.077
I don't want to be your beard anymore, Paris.

10:02.179 --> 10:03.310
Why don't you just go talk to Asher?

10:03.400 --> 10:05.082
I don't take his class. People will get suspicious.

10:05.465 --> 10:07.668
What, is he taking confession or something? You can't go.

10:07.806 --> 10:10.380
Paris, come on. You know, I'm not gonna be in this class forever,

10:10.549 --> 10:12.726
which means next year you're gonna have to find some other idiot

10:12.782 --> 10:14.084
to stand here until the coast is clear.

10:14.144 --> 10:16.341
That's alright. It's all going to be coming out eventually.

10:16.478 --> 10:18.414
Asher asked me to go to Oxford with him this summer.

10:18.481 --> 10:23.314
Oxford? Really? Oxford? That's -- wow. Oxford.

10:23.503 --> 10:26.013
So, this is really getting serious.

10:26.095 --> 10:28.624
There's now travel involved and as soon as news of the trip gets around,

10:28.685 --> 10:30.344
- then I guess the secret is out. 
- I guess so.

10:30.590 --> 10:32.418
Oh, crap. Pretend you have to see him in his office.

10:32.494 --> 10:34.332
You were confused on the last point he made.

10:34.491 --> 10:37.849
You were gonna ask him after class, but Toby from "American Splendor" wouldn't stop yapping and you couldn't.

10:38.076 --> 10:40.186
I feel my mouth moving, something's coming out and yet...

10:40.271 --> 10:41.296
Walk faster. We'll miss him.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.883
- Did you find what you need? 
- Oh, yeah. Fine.

10:52.493 --> 10:53.768
- What are you doing? 
- I have to ring them up.

10:53.896 --> 10:57.704
I'll just tell you the prices. This one is $24.99.

10:57.829 --> 10:59.154
- That high? 
- They're your prices.

10:59.236 --> 11:00.726
- Can I just see the book? 
- I'm reading you the book.

11:00.829 --> 11:03.967
It says right here. Oh, wait -- that's the Canadian price. $14.99.

11:04.049 --> 11:05.216
Will you just let me scan the book?

11:05.375 --> 11:07.766
When you scan the book, do you see the title?

11:07.874 --> 11:08.903
- Yes. 
- Then no.

11:09.015 --> 11:10.802
Luke, come on. What do you got there, porn?

11:10.884 --> 11:11.928
- You sell porn? 
- No!

11:12.051 --> 11:13.414
You think I brought my own porn in here to buy?

11:13.512 --> 11:15.676
I don't know what you're doing. I just need to scan the books.

11:17.300 --> 11:18.150
This should cover it.

11:18.375 --> 11:19.803
A hundred bucks? That's way too much.

11:20.519 --> 11:21.094
Take it.

11:27.182 --> 11:27.678
Bag.

11:56.335 --> 11:58.623
- Love! 
- Jeez!

11:58.722 --> 12:00.542
You want it? You can have it.

12:00.825 --> 12:05.638
And not compromised, stifling, soul-killing love, but open, honest, life-affirming love.

12:05.919 --> 12:08.551
But how do you get it? How do you get this love?

12:08.665 --> 12:10.168
If I knew that, what the hell would I need you for?

12:10.247 --> 12:13.323
It's going to take work. It's going to take introspection.

12:13.531 --> 12:16.616
You're gonna have to learn new things -- how to be your own best friend,

12:16.775 --> 12:19.610
how to treat your damaged psyche with a little kindness,

12:19.745 --> 12:22.319
how to say, "hey, pal, you're worth it.

12:22.468 --> 12:25.217
You mean something to someone, and you deserve love."

12:25.801 --> 12:29.693
That is the key. If you crave love, then you deserve love.

12:29.979 --> 12:34.302
Say that to yourself. If I crave love, I deserve love.

12:35.542 --> 12:38.518
Now, how did that feel coming out? I'll bet it was hard.

12:38.718 --> 12:43.445
I'll bet you felt ridiculous. Some of you may even have been incapable of saying it at all.

12:43.802 --> 12:45.759
- Try again. 
- I'm not incapable.

12:45.841 --> 12:47.997
I just haven't been hit in the head with the Oprah stick lately.

12:48.268 --> 12:51.166
Trust me, my friend -- it will get easier,

12:51.310 --> 12:54.215
until one day, you turn around, and you are not alone.

12:54.816 --> 12:57.888
Ready to begin the journey? It's going to be one hell of a ride.

12:58.124 --> 13:01.447
Okay, let's go. Open up your workbook to page one.

13:03.482 --> 13:05.051
It doesn't get lower than this.

13:09.132 --> 13:11.128
You know Dean, we appreciate you working late all this week.

13:11.226 --> 13:12.649
Hey, I appreciate the extra cash.

13:14.207 --> 13:18.419
Oh. The wire snapped. I can fix it.

13:18.825 --> 13:21.610
- He's like a superhero. 
- He's like Super Mr. Fix-it man.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.923
- We'll work on a name. 
- Your tool belt would glow.

13:24.062 --> 13:24.896
I can't wait.

13:26.268 --> 13:28.829
Hey, what did you think of the onion soup I made today?

13:28.937 --> 13:31.071
- Oh, it was good. 
- Good enough for the opening?

13:31.440 --> 13:35.709
No, we have to serve your critically acclaimed zucchini soup for the opening.

13:35.956 --> 13:38.874
I know, but Jackson has some concerns about the zucchini crop,

13:39.028 --> 13:40.680
- so I want to have a backup. 
- No, Sookie.

13:40.743 --> 13:43.138
We've got to serve the zucchini soup. People are expecting it.

13:43.299 --> 13:44.460
The zucchini have got to be there.

13:44.522 --> 13:46.564
Well then, I'll just tell Jackson he has to have them.

13:46.728 --> 13:49.093
- Dean, come on. 
- Lindsay, I'm working.

13:49.237 --> 13:51.515
- Are you? How shocking. 
- What do you want me to do?

13:51.695 --> 13:53.574
We're supposed to go out with Erika and David tonight.

13:53.681 --> 13:55.924
- I can't! 
- So why would you say you could?!

13:56.021 --> 13:58.489
Lindsay, I told you, if there was a chance for some extra hours...

13:58.612 --> 14:00.097
- Oh, come on! 
- that I was gonna take it.

14:00.194 --> 14:01.572
We never do anything, Dean.

14:01.683 --> 14:04.106
We need money! God! You know that, Lindsay!

14:04.198 --> 14:08.012
You are so incredibly selfish. You never think about me -- never.

14:08.084 --> 14:10.112
You want a town house? You want a new car?

14:10.235 --> 14:13.885
- We need money to pay for these things. 
- I sit at home all day waiting for you.

14:14.024 --> 14:16.742
You never call during the day, like you always promise you will.

14:16.839 --> 14:18.657
- God, Lindsay! 
- I'm bored, Dean.

14:18.897 --> 14:23.158
Don't you care about that? I want to go out with my husband. Hello! We're married here!

14:23.234 --> 14:25.379
I'll be done in a couple of hours. If you want to...

14:25.447 --> 14:27.386
- I'm going out with Erika and David. 
- Fine. Go.

14:28.149 --> 14:29.833
- When will you be home? 
- When I get home.

14:30.960 --> 14:33.960
- That's nice, Lindsay. That's real nice. 
- Whatever, Dean.

14:38.133 --> 14:41.830
Complete the following sentence -- I feel angry because...

14:41.937 --> 14:43.535
I am listening to this tape.

14:43.929 --> 14:47.846
- I feel hopeful because... 
- This tape must end eventually.

14:47.948 --> 14:50.032
I feel helpless because...

14:50.188 --> 14:52.358
I wonder if anyone's ever kicked an audiotape's ass.

14:53.129 --> 14:54.487
Jeez. Hold on.

14:59.100 --> 15:02.142
- What are you doing here? 
- Look how happy he is to see me.

15:02.299 --> 15:05.290
- I just didn't expect it, that's all. 
- Oh, my brother.

15:05.458 --> 15:07.743
- You remember T.J., right? 
- I'm still here.

15:07.844 --> 15:09.832
- How you doin', T.J.? 
- How am I doing? 

15:09.914 --> 15:11.679
Lizzie, I don't know. How am I doing?

15:11.788 --> 15:14.148
He's doing great! 'Cause we're getting married.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.867
- Married? Really? 
- And we're doing it right here next week.

15:16.948 --> 15:17.579
Wow, that's fast.

15:17.696 --> 15:19.969
I know but we wanted to do it before the circuit got going

15:20.051 --> 15:23.291
so all our friends could come. It gonna be so beautiful. Wait till you see.

15:23.372 --> 15:25.426
- You ever been to a Renaissance wedding? 
- No, I haven't.

15:25.519 --> 15:29.232
Oh, it's great -- horses, costumes, really big turkey legs. You're gonna love it.

15:29.328 --> 15:32.800
- Okay, you gotta slow down here. 
- No way. You slow down and you die.

15:32.907 --> 15:34.474
- When did this happen? 
- Last week.

15:34.592 --> 15:37.643
T.J. asked me, I said yes, we made a few phone calls,

15:37.719 --> 15:41.202
and here we are, grabbing life by the ping-pongs, as T.J. says.

15:41.284 --> 15:42.799
Hey, there's gonna be a bachelor party, too.

15:42.881 --> 15:44.955
My brother's coming down, got a couple of friends dropping in.

15:45.063 --> 15:46.767
It's going to be a blast. You have to go.

15:46.875 --> 15:49.778
- Oh, sure, if you want me to. 
- Want you to? Of course I want you to.

15:49.870 --> 15:52.875
What are you talking about? I want you to be my best man also.

15:52.948 --> 15:53.982
- You're kidding. 
- Of course I am.

15:54.053 --> 15:55.773
You'd be like 800th on the list.

15:55.845 --> 15:58.373
But you can come to the bachelor party if you want.

15:58.432 --> 16:00.095
Are you happy for me? Say you're happy for me.

16:00.162 --> 16:03.391
Sure, I'm happy for you. Of course I'll go to your bachelor party.

16:03.469 --> 16:05.742
Good. Keeping up appearances that we like each other --

16:05.808 --> 16:07.949
- very classy for the wedding. 
- T.J., come on.

16:08.047 --> 16:10.504
Okay, I'm going to get some beer.

16:11.790 --> 16:13.156
Where's he going? He doesn't know where to go.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.805
He's got a nose for these things.

16:15.624 --> 16:17.922
Oh, wait till you see this wedding.

16:18.086 --> 16:20.837
Oh, my God. It's unbelievable.

16:21.004 --> 16:23.442
- I'm wearing a white dress... 
- That is unbelievable.

16:23.545 --> 16:26.776
Oh, stop it. It's about a zillion years old with flowing sleeves.

16:26.997 --> 16:29.274
I'm like Vanessa Redgrave in "Camelot."

16:29.381 --> 16:32.705
Seriously, I love myself in this dress.

16:32.791 --> 16:33.790
Sounds like a good dress.

16:33.887 --> 16:36.888
I'm so excited. I'm getting married... again.

16:39.853 --> 16:41.505
So, how are you gonna do this so quickly?

16:42.212 --> 16:46.267
Well, we're gonna have the ceremony right out there in the square.

16:46.374 --> 16:48.842
We've got our Renaissance Fair buds all pitching in.

16:49.155 --> 16:53.348
We got the Scotch-egg guy to cater it and T.J.'s gonna write the vows.

16:53.518 --> 16:54.762
- You won't have to do a thing. 
- Oh, sure.

16:54.859 --> 16:56.661
I swear -- everything's taken care of.

16:56.758 --> 16:58.818
- Carrie's gonna be my maid of honor. 
- Terrific.

16:58.949 --> 17:00.778
- She's a good friend. 
- To one and all.

17:00.865 --> 17:02.524
- So, does Jess know? 
- He knows.

17:02.723 --> 17:04.218
- Did he take it well? 
- Took it like Jess.

17:04.330 --> 17:04.890
Meaning?

17:06.492 --> 17:07.986
- He's not coming. 
- Why not?

17:08.145 --> 17:10.146
- He's young, he's busy. 
- Busy doing what?

17:10.229 --> 17:11.304
I don't know. It's okay.

17:11.925 --> 17:14.089
I just thought -- but it's no biggie.

17:14.208 --> 17:17.126
- I mean, hey, I got you there, right? 
- Yeah, you do.

17:17.286 --> 17:19.487
- Are you gonna dress up? 
- Absolutely.

17:19.619 --> 17:20.637
- As a minstrel? 
- Sure.

17:20.712 --> 17:22.804
Who's the guy who jumps around in bells and a pointy hat?

17:22.906 --> 17:24.586
- The court jester. 
- Yes, the court jester.

17:24.678 --> 17:25.743
I will come as a court jester.

17:27.094 --> 17:28.088
You're a good brother.

17:28.698 --> 17:31.709
You got any of that terrible peach pie you make? I'm starving.

17:34.006 --> 17:35.716
- Hello. 
- Did you bring the Nutter Butters?

17:35.812 --> 17:37.545
Well, I'm fine, Mother. I missed you, too.

17:38.109 --> 17:40.485
- Ah, we have achieved culinary perfection. 
- What's with the carrots?

17:40.858 --> 17:42.552
I was afraid you weren't eating right at school.

17:42.881 --> 17:44.733
- Marshmallow? 
- Thank you.

17:45.574 --> 17:47.407
Oh, man, I've missed Al's Chinese night.

17:47.657 --> 17:49.925
Oh, he's got a new thing now -- chicken chow mein sandwich.

17:50.073 --> 17:51.426
- Oh, Al. 
- Oh, Al.

17:51.518 --> 17:54.492
So what exactly was Grandma's excuse for canceling Friday night dinner?

17:54.621 --> 17:57.104
- That Dad was traveling and she had a function. 
- It was that generic?

17:57.216 --> 17:59.980
She put no thought into it, and it was muffled, but at the end of the call,

18:00.053 --> 18:02.823
I do believe I heard a knock and someone yelling, "turndown service."

18:02.945 --> 18:04.963
- Living in a hotel. 
- And hiding it.

18:05.152 --> 18:06.454
Poor Grandma. We should talk to them.

18:06.590 --> 18:08.204
- "We"? 
- Well, you. I'm a child.

18:08.290 --> 18:09.676
Talking is not my parents' thing.

18:09.827 --> 18:13.048
It would humiliate them if they knew that we knew that they are...

18:13.529 --> 18:15.290
- whatever they are. 
- So, we do nothing?

18:15.428 --> 18:16.785
I guess we wait until one of them cracks.

18:16.934 --> 18:18.936
Okay. Man, how many tapes are we watching tonight?

18:19.012 --> 18:21.681
Well, every time I started watching something that I thought you would like,

18:21.768 --> 18:24.915
I stopped watching it and I saved it for when we could watch it together,

18:24.988 --> 18:26.821
so I watched the first 10 minutes of 12 movies.

18:27.139 --> 18:28.310
So which one are we gonna watch?

18:28.571 --> 18:31.481
The absolute funniest movie known to man --

18:32.330 --> 18:34.229
- "Fatso." 
- I'm loving the title.

18:34.311 --> 18:37.281
- Anne Bancroft wrote and directed it. 
- Well, Annie Sullivan, look at you go.

18:39.047 --> 18:41.100
So how's everything at the inn coming along?

18:41.214 --> 18:43.917
Everyone's freaking out because I got a million things to do,

18:44.004 --> 18:46.697
but we finally got the pictures up, and the beds were delivered today.

18:46.780 --> 18:49.764
Oh, I forgot -- a little bit of gossip.

18:49.887 --> 18:52.205
- Oh. What? 
- No, it's not fun gossip.

18:52.308 --> 18:53.103
What? What?

18:53.255 --> 18:55.969
Well, Sookie and I overheard Dean and Lindsay having a major fight.

18:56.097 --> 18:59.174
- It was ugly. 
- Really? About what?

18:59.297 --> 19:01.996
Well, she was mad because he was working late to make some extra cash,

19:02.108 --> 19:04.064
and she wanted to go out, and it got heated and vicious,

19:04.202 --> 19:07.130
and the whole thing ended with a "Whatever, Dean."

19:07.392 --> 19:08.739
- That sounds bad. 
- It wasn't good.

19:09.604 --> 19:11.001
- Maybe they'll make up. 
- I hope so.

19:11.483 --> 19:12.804
Yeah, me too.

19:13.464 --> 19:15.743
Fat! Fat! Fat!

19:15.871 --> 19:18.415
- This is the greatest thing I've ever seen. 
- Kiss for Mommy.

19:31.655 --> 19:34.257
Hey, neighbor, the guys next door just ran out of crack to sell,

19:34.343 --> 19:37.451
so they sent me over to borrow a cup. Hey, nice place.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.798
You put those holes there yourself?

19:41.102 --> 19:41.798
What are you doing here?

19:41.922 --> 19:43.898
- Just wanted to see how you were doing. 
- Doing great.

19:44.020 --> 19:46.233
Great, you're doing great. Wow, you're doing great.

19:46.294 --> 19:47.983
I'm not doing great, and I have running water.

19:48.246 --> 19:50.421
- The place is fine. 
- Fine. Not great? What happened to great?

19:50.903 --> 19:53.355
- All this and no housewarming gift. 
- Okay, okay. I'm sorry.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.326
I just thought you were going absolutely nowhere with your life.

19:56.437 --> 19:59.064
Glad I'm wrong. Hey, which filthy mattress is yours?

19:59.279 --> 20:00.006
Right there.

20:00.328 --> 20:02.423
Oh. Well, you got the good corner, with a view of the mold.

20:02.495 --> 20:05.770
Yeah, I won the toss. Now, if you don't mind, I've got places to be.

20:06.119 --> 20:09.293
Let's get down to it. Liz told me you weren't coming to the wedding.

20:09.421 --> 20:11.742
- No way you're here about that. 
- I am here about that.

20:11.873 --> 20:12.771
- Why? 
- Why?

20:12.970 --> 20:14.911
Your mother's getting married, and you're not coming.

20:15.028 --> 20:16.897
No biggie. I'll just catch the next one.

20:16.958 --> 20:19.037
- Jess, this guy is different. 
- Come on.

20:19.128 --> 20:21.228
Well he could be different. He seems different.

20:21.372 --> 20:23.395
- Jeez, man. 
- I've seen him with Liz.

20:23.542 --> 20:27.532
They seem to work. We need to support this thing to give it a chance.

20:27.623 --> 20:28.478
No, we don't.

20:29.851 --> 20:31.480
- You are gonna regret this. 
- I doubt it.

20:31.551 --> 20:32.922
No, you are.

20:33.143 --> 20:35.176
If you ever manage to grow up and get yourself together

20:35.263 --> 20:39.077
and drop this selfish self-destructive behavior that you are so fond of, if that ever happens,

20:39.271 --> 20:41.812
you are gonna look back on this moment and you are gonna feel

20:41.923 --> 20:44.877
like a big steaming mound of crap that you missed this.

20:44.954 --> 20:46.173
This could have been a turning point.

20:46.224 --> 20:48.488
You could have witnessed something good for your mother who, yes,

20:48.543 --> 20:52.312
has screwed up a bit in her life but now seems to have found something to make her happy,

20:52.373 --> 20:54.555
and you miss that, you refuse to be a part of that,

20:54.811 --> 20:56.281
you are gonna be very sorry.

20:57.996 --> 20:59.332
What, are you a drug dealer now?

20:59.481 --> 21:01.800
I'm a messenger. I gotta go. Hey, Todd, it's 4:00.

21:02.901 --> 21:03.633
You owe me.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.562
I was there for you when no one else was,

21:06.700 --> 21:08.732
and I want you there... and you owe me.

21:08.840 --> 21:09.417
I gotta go.

21:09.823 --> 21:10.514
So do I.

21:11.651 --> 21:12.838
I'm going first.

21:13.827 --> 21:14.641
Hey, Todd.

21:19.459 --> 21:22.347
No, Roy, I know what I'm talking about. I'm looking for stalks of wheat,

21:22.429 --> 21:23.950
not processed wheat, stalks.

21:25.168 --> 21:27.767
That's putting it another way. I need bare-ass stalks. Sorry.

21:28.589 --> 21:32.182
I know you can't eat it like that. I just need it for decoration.

21:32.971 --> 21:35.275
No, I'm not going poofy on you, damn it! Sorry.

21:36.314 --> 21:39.632
I just need to know whether you have it or not. No? Okay, whatever. Thanks.

21:40.619 --> 21:42.750
Is there no wheat left in this country? What happened to Kansas?

21:42.832 --> 21:46.145
- Isn't Kansas lousy with wheat? 
- I do recall Toto running through fields of it.

21:46.293 --> 21:47.649
- Coffee to go, please. 
- That I can get.

21:47.773 --> 21:49.160
- Why do you need wheat? 
- Liz's wedding.

21:49.416 --> 21:51.029
- Liz is getting married? 
- She and T.J.

21:51.208 --> 21:52.345
- Did I know this? 
- I guess not.

21:52.744 --> 21:54.951
- In New York? 
- Here in the square, a Renaissance thing.

21:55.381 --> 21:58.341
- Could I be a little more behind? 
- I got sucked in, just like always.

21:58.428 --> 22:01.074
First day, their cellphone died, so I let them use the phone.

22:01.213 --> 22:04.259
Then I offered to make the call 'cause I happened to know the person they were calling,

22:04.340 --> 22:06.661
and I had to go pick something up because I couldn't find T.J. to do it.

22:06.748 --> 22:10.009
And kapow, I'm hunting down wheat stalks and looking for local pewter craftsmen.

22:10.208 --> 22:11.899
Do you have any idea where I can find myrtle?

22:12.042 --> 22:13.614
- Did you check the bingo parlor? 
- The plant.

22:13.692 --> 22:16.031
Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list.

22:16.155 --> 22:17.609
- Sorry. Here's your coffee. 
- Thank you.

22:17.879 --> 22:20.357
So, I can't believe I didn't know about this wedding.

22:20.394 --> 22:22.200
- I'm caught up on everything now, right? 
- I'd say so.

22:22.461 --> 22:24.321
I'm not paying for a motel, so I'm staying with you.

22:25.417 --> 22:26.195
Liar!

22:26.308 --> 22:28.835
I wasn't sure he was coming. I went to see him in New York.

22:29.026 --> 22:30.976
You went to New York? I needed things picked up in New York.

22:31.124 --> 22:33.342
Hey, don't add stuff from your to-do list to my to-do list.

22:33.777 --> 22:34.734
- Sorry. 
- It's okay.

22:35.051 --> 22:35.631
I should go.

22:36.148 --> 22:39.527
Hey, do you know that if the entire population of China walked by,

22:39.623 --> 22:42.098
the line would never end because of the rate of population increase?

22:42.230 --> 22:42.748
No, I didn't.

22:42.890 --> 22:45.138
That's my list -- every Chinese person in the world.

22:45.440 --> 22:46.290
- Scary. 
- Scary.

22:48.031 --> 22:49.608
What do you think? Friday night good?

22:49.833 --> 22:52.567
- I'm busy, Glenn. 
- You're never busy on Friday nights.

22:52.628 --> 22:56.116
You always eat dinner early on Fridays and watch TV and go to bed around 10:30.

22:56.330 --> 22:57.484
You're spying on me?!

22:57.754 --> 22:59.832
Close your blinds if you're gonna be so sensitive.

23:01.344 --> 23:01.907
Hello?

23:02.778 --> 23:03.621
Paris, slow down.

23:04.554 --> 23:05.137
Where are you?

23:06.136 --> 23:09.084
Stop saying "the hospital." There are tons of hospitals. Which hospital?

23:10.517 --> 23:13.569
- Ah, you're here. 
- I do show up occasionally.

23:13.816 --> 23:14.798
The place looks the same.

23:15.566 --> 23:16.237
Is that your dinner?

23:16.683 --> 23:18.521
Couldn't book my usual table at Le Cirque.

23:18.905 --> 23:19.340
Right.

23:20.671 --> 23:22.894
I wasn't sure what food I could eat.

23:23.022 --> 23:24.793
Eat what you like. Start with the expired stuff.

23:25.592 --> 23:26.839
Maybe I'll go out.

23:26.912 --> 23:29.115
I'm hearing a good buzz about a chow mein sandwich.

23:29.191 --> 23:32.797
What's on the playlist these days? I'm guessing Jethro Tull or Jethro Tull.

23:32.846 --> 23:34.455
- Just stay away from that. 
- What's with you?

23:34.530 --> 23:37.937
Never mind. Look, eat my food, use my shower. Just don't go poking around my stuff.

23:38.120 --> 23:40.405
- Mr. Sensitive. 
- Whatever. Enjoy your evening.

23:40.825 --> 23:41.443
Don't wait up.

23:48.442 --> 23:50.071
You're a road in need of some repair.

23:50.639 --> 23:54.562
If your score is between 30 and 40 points, then you're a road laden with potholes

23:54.669 --> 23:57.863
and you need a double striping. And if your score is 40 or above,

23:57.997 --> 24:01.064
it's jackhammer time because your road is impassable.

24:01.228 --> 24:01.759
Yikes.

24:02.446 --> 24:03.158
Chapter 7.

24:04.275 --> 24:07.105
Men, a question -- what is fantasy?

24:07.382 --> 24:11.831
The answer -- fantasy is the imaginative fulfillment of your heart's desire.

24:11.908 --> 24:14.360
And one of the most common fantasies for single men

24:14.438 --> 24:16.864
is the fantasy of your ultimate companion.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.119
Yada yada yada.

24:18.738 --> 24:21.944
Story time. I had a friend -- let's call him Phillip --

24:22.056 --> 24:25.287
who couldn't make up his mind amongst three different women that he liked.

24:25.706 --> 24:28.937
I developed a test for him... and for you.

24:29.065 --> 24:29.805
Oh, goody.

24:30.462 --> 24:33.828
Whose phone calls or visits are never unwanted or too long?

24:34.548 --> 24:35.722
Do you see her face?

24:36.463 --> 24:40.104
Who would you most like to have in your life to ward off moments of loneliness?

24:40.707 --> 24:41.696
Do you see her face?

24:42.859 --> 24:46.077
When you travel, who would make your travels more enjoyable?

24:46.816 --> 24:48.041
Do you see her face?

24:48.900 --> 24:51.988
When you're in pain, who would you most like to comfort you?

24:52.823 --> 24:53.672
Do you see her face?

24:54.906 --> 24:56.918
When something wonderful happens in your life

24:57.118 --> 25:00.036
-- a promotion at work, a successful refinancing --

25:00.441 --> 25:02.297
who do you want to share the news with?

25:03.196 --> 25:04.363
Do you see her face?

25:05.556 --> 25:07.317
Whose face appears to you, my friend?

25:08.520 --> 25:09.396
Whose face?

25:18.437 --> 25:21.971
Excuse me, I'm sorry, but I'm not sure which floor to go to.

25:22.110 --> 25:23.793
I've been getting conflicting advice.

25:24.152 --> 25:28.202
A friend of mine is here, but she didn't say exactly where, so I'm just wondering...

25:28.566 --> 25:30.675
Why do I have to say everything twice? Why?

25:30.746 --> 25:33.542
I don't want my time wasted that way. You don't want your time wasted that way.

25:33.746 --> 25:36.373
Lives are dependent on you very people not wasting your time.

25:36.568 --> 25:38.724
I came here because of your reputation.

25:38.820 --> 25:40.362
Don't make me destroy that reputation.

25:40.439 --> 25:41.381
Miss, you have to lower your voice.

25:41.483 --> 25:43.941
That is Professor Asher Fleming in there, of Yale University.

25:44.068 --> 25:47.596
He's an important man, and you're acting like you're about to sell his spleen to UCLA.

25:47.689 --> 25:49.020
The procedures are the procedures.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.349
Oh, really? I thought the procedures were a hat.

25:51.513 --> 25:53.187
Hit me with some more lame tautology, Socrates.

25:53.372 --> 25:56.659
That's enough. Now, calm down, take a seat, and let us continue our work.

25:56.808 --> 25:59.939
Oh, you men, always telling us to calm down. Me, Hillary, Martha,

26:00.012 --> 26:02.250
the second we make a squeak, you're pushing us onto the fainting couch.

26:02.352 --> 26:03.601
- Honey, please. 
- Paris.

26:03.992 --> 26:05.905
Asher asked for a moistened towel 20 minutes ago,

26:05.967 --> 26:07.576
and no one's brought him a moistened towel.

26:07.647 --> 26:10.607
This man is an award-winning novelist, a sought-after lecturer.

26:10.667 --> 26:13.985
He deserves a moistened towel! Give me a towel! I'll moisten the damn thing myself!

26:14.203 --> 26:15.669
Paris, come on. Fill me in here.

26:15.793 --> 26:18.076
Stat! Stat! Do you not know what "stat" means?

26:18.249 --> 26:21.091
- They say it on all the hospital shows. 
- Come on, Paris. What's happening?

26:21.230 --> 26:22.674
- It's Asher. 
- I know, what's happening?

26:23.047 --> 26:25.034
We were out getting some gelato and he dropped his spoon,

26:25.131 --> 26:28.136
and when I picked it up, he started to lean on me like he was about to fall,

26:28.218 --> 26:30.794
- and he was having these pains. 
- Oh my God.

26:30.907 --> 26:32.608
So we sat down, and he said he was fine,

26:32.710 --> 26:35.270
but I got worried because he looked so pale,

26:35.331 --> 26:37.778
so I rushed him here to this chop shop masquerading as a hospital,

26:37.849 --> 26:39.232
and I can't get anyone to help him.

26:39.315 --> 26:41.526
This is a really good hospital. They know what they're doing.

26:41.628 --> 26:43.103
- He wanted a towel. 
- They'll get him one.

26:43.190 --> 26:45.515
And they wouldn't let me see even him because I'm not a blood relative.

26:45.694 --> 26:47.563
He's got two grown kids. Where are they?

26:47.659 --> 26:50.035
I mean, you put food on their table, a roof over their heads,

26:50.122 --> 26:52.161
- and this is how they repay you? 
- What's doctor saying? Is it serious?

26:52.249 --> 26:56.496
It wasn't a heart attack. It was angina or something. I think he's gonna be fine.

26:56.630 --> 26:57.675
- Good. 
- But...

26:57.746 --> 26:58.509
But what?

26:59.369 --> 27:01.959
The wobbly, the look on his face, the angina...

27:03.137 --> 27:04.269
- he's old. 
- What?

27:04.402 --> 27:06.225
Asher. He has pains, he wobbles.

27:06.430 --> 27:09.072
I spotted him through the curtain when the doctor came out,

27:09.154 --> 27:12.659
and he was just lying on that bed all alone, and he had his eyes open

27:12.747 --> 27:14.299
and was just staring at the ceiling.

27:15.093 --> 27:17.503
- He looked so close to death. 
- He's not that close.

27:17.622 --> 27:18.529
He's closer than me.

27:18.616 --> 27:22.215
An anvil could hit you on the head tomorrow, and he could live another 40 years.

27:22.295 --> 27:25.185
I'm 19. I should be rollicking. Asher doesn't rollick.

27:25.281 --> 27:27.796
Well he probably didn't rollick when he was younger either. He's British.

27:27.872 --> 27:29.895
You should have seen the way he was staring at the ceiling,

27:30.218 --> 27:32.362
- like he was looking at God. 
- He wasn't looking at God.

27:32.541 --> 27:34.533
You've probably been laughing at me all these months.

27:34.585 --> 27:36.065
- Paris, no, I haven't. 
- I'm in a hospital.

27:36.162 --> 27:39.367
I should be at a discotheque. Are kids still into the discotheque?

27:39.418 --> 27:42.198
Paris, come on. Let's go get you something to drink. Let the hospital do their work.

27:42.750 --> 27:44.003
He orders old gelato.

27:44.400 --> 27:47.236
- Old gelato? 
- Vanilla. It's a very old flavor.

27:47.631 --> 27:49.848
Oh, I hate these pillows with a passion.

27:50.155 --> 27:51.712
- They look good. 
- Good, not great?

27:51.833 --> 27:53.324
- They look great. 
- Great, not fabulous?

27:53.544 --> 27:55.126
- Fabulous. 
- Fabulous, not mondo-fabulous?

27:55.264 --> 27:56.842
- Come on. 
- They look good to me.

27:56.985 --> 27:58.030
- Good, not great? 
- Lorelai.

27:58.152 --> 27:58.879
Twenty-eight to go.

27:59.023 --> 28:01.614
Does it bother you that the word "laundry" is misspelled?

28:01.746 --> 28:05.521
No! I proofed these pages a million times.

28:05.627 --> 28:09.785
That breaks my heart. L-a-u-n-d-r-y. That's right.

28:09.889 --> 28:13.350
- No, it's d-r-i-e. 
- No, laundry -- l-a-u-n-d-r-y.

28:13.426 --> 28:15.737
- There's a "u?" There's no "u." 
- There's a "u" but no "y."

28:15.833 --> 28:17.415
There's a "y" but no "i-e," and a "u."

28:17.472 --> 28:19.238
- Or a "u." 
- No, no. There's a "u."

28:19.535 --> 28:22.171
There's no "i-e." It's a "y" -- this is giving me a headache.

28:22.443 --> 28:24.439
Does "consommé" have two m's?

28:24.541 --> 28:27.132
- Hey, Abbott, just assemble the books. 
- It's getting late.

28:27.394 --> 28:29.841
- How late can you stay, Sookie? 
- As late as you want --

28:29.939 --> 28:32.750
Davey's with his grandparents, and Jackson's sleeping with the zucchini tonight.

28:32.842 --> 28:35.550
- What's that, farm jargon? 
- No, he's sleeping with the zucchini.

28:35.647 --> 28:37.389
But what does that mean, sleeping with the zucchini?

28:37.573 --> 28:39.554
It means he's sleeping with the zucchini.

28:39.733 --> 28:42.393
Sookie, fill me in here. Where's Jackson?

28:42.549 --> 28:45.345
Well, he checked the forecast today, and there's a potential cold front

28:45.433 --> 28:47.464
coming in from Canada, and he knows how important

28:47.527 --> 28:49.231
the zucchini is for opening day menu, so...

28:49.364 --> 28:51.238
Are you saying that "sleeping with the zucchini" means...

28:51.325 --> 28:53.522
He's sleeping with the zucchini.

28:53.609 --> 28:56.255
She's said it four times. You're very slow tonight.

28:56.383 --> 28:57.243
Oh my God.

28:57.531 --> 29:00.464
Well, you said to do whatever it takes to make sure we have fresh zucchini.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.154
- Within the realm of reason. 
- Oh. Now you add that.

29:03.275 --> 29:05.994
- Where are you going? 
- To the zucchini patch.

29:07.198 --> 29:09.353
- All of us or... 
- Michel!

29:11.595 --> 29:14.754
- Boys, we have arrived. 
- You said it, brother, my brother.

29:18.331 --> 29:19.936
- Stomachache? 
- I'm fine.

29:20.489 --> 29:22.604
- Check out the fresh nooks. 
- Nice and fresh.

29:23.283 --> 29:24.451
- Not your scene? 
- Not really.

29:24.698 --> 29:25.459
Mine neither.

29:26.274 --> 29:29.398
This is for the guys. These days, there's nothing I'd rather do in the world

29:29.464 --> 29:30.790
than spoon with your sister.

29:32.481 --> 29:34.431
- Stomach again? 
- That time, yeah.

29:34.692 --> 29:36.346
Let's grab seats before they're all taken.

29:41.041 --> 29:42.566
- Lap dance? 
- Oh, no, thanks.

29:42.699 --> 29:45.915
- I'm just here for a bachelor party. 
- That's kind of why I'm here, too.

29:46.068 --> 29:47.881
Well, thanks for the offer, but, no, thank you.

29:47.984 --> 29:50.579
But thank you. It was nice. Thanks. Thank you.

29:50.810 --> 29:51.455
Thank you.

29:52.657 --> 29:54.998
Luke, come on. You should get a lap dance.

29:55.111 --> 29:56.596
- I'm fine. 
- Are you gonna stand all night?

29:56.718 --> 29:59.324
If I stand, there's no lap to dance on. Everything will be easier.

29:59.473 --> 30:01.485
- Wow. That's something there. 
- What's is?

30:01.598 --> 30:05.525
What you just said about your lap. The fact is, there is no such thing as a lap.

30:05.642 --> 30:06.743
- Come on. 
- Think about it --

30:06.912 --> 30:10.215
it's there when you're sitting, but it's gone when you stand, so where does it go?

30:10.523 --> 30:14.404
It doesn't go anywhere, meaning... it never was.

30:15.170 --> 30:17.372
So a lap is just an illusion.

30:17.737 --> 30:20.086
Whoa. The way his mind works.

30:20.281 --> 30:21.418
Oh, it's something else.

30:22.283 --> 30:25.181
- Where have you been? 
- Bathroom. It's best to use it before the puking starts.

30:25.286 --> 30:27.587
You left me hanging with the Lords of Flatbush here.

30:27.745 --> 30:28.345
Sorry.

30:31.775 --> 30:34.274
- Aren't you gonna sit? 
- He doesn't want to make a lap.

30:34.420 --> 30:35.784
- A lap is an illusion. 
- What?

30:35.907 --> 30:38.257
- Don't get him started. 
- Hey, I want to talk to you later.

30:38.396 --> 30:39.752
I always enjoy a good palaver.

30:40.033 --> 30:41.038
We'll talk.

30:52.138 --> 30:53.878
Thanks for the drink. I owe you.

30:54.191 --> 30:55.097
You don't owe me anything.

30:55.558 --> 30:57.320
- You can go in now. 
- Thank you.

30:58.870 --> 31:00.258
Well, I think I'm going to go talk to him.

31:01.713 --> 31:03.868
And have the talk -- a real talk.

31:04.175 --> 31:06.648
- Oh. Now? 
- This can't go on. It's too weird.

31:07.451 --> 31:09.762
- Tonight's been sort of an eye-opener. 
- Well, it's up to you.

31:09.858 --> 31:12.828
We're supposed to leave for England in two weeks. I shouldn't string him along.

31:12.914 --> 31:16.370
Right. Now is good, and to do it is good... for a number of reasons.

31:16.509 --> 31:17.123
What reasons?

31:17.578 --> 31:19.960
I just meant all the reasons that you already know.

31:20.011 --> 31:22.346
- Wait for me -- take me home? 
- Yeah. I'll be right out here.

31:25.823 --> 31:26.386
Asher?

31:26.958 --> 31:27.495
Paris?

31:28.336 --> 31:29.443
Come, come.

31:31.755 --> 31:33.825
- You needn't have stayed. 
- Oh, no.

31:34.383 --> 31:37.711
- I mean, I had the keys. 
- Then it was very convenient that you did stay.

31:37.809 --> 31:39.574
- Did you ever get your towel? 
- Five of them.

31:40.057 --> 31:42.160
And I'm very grateful. Thank you, angel.

31:44.066 --> 31:45.473
- Yes? 
- Are you feeling better?

31:45.621 --> 31:48.070
- Oh, I'm feeling much better. 
- Good, good. I'm glad.

31:48.171 --> 31:51.101
I mean, you read all these awful stories in the paper --

31:51.198 --> 31:54.504
you know, a guy comes in with a stomachache, and they amputate his foot.

31:54.664 --> 31:55.186
Paris...

31:56.568 --> 31:57.367
come sit down.

32:02.968 --> 32:05.324
You know, a hospital seems a wonderful place

32:05.446 --> 32:08.360
to discuss something serious, doesn't it?

32:08.979 --> 32:09.584
I guess.

32:11.556 --> 32:14.531
I want you to know that I'm grateful for every moment

32:14.602 --> 32:16.377
that we've spent together this past year.

32:17.452 --> 32:19.071
You're wonderful company.

32:20.509 --> 32:24.053
- I don't think I've said that enough. 
- No. You have.

32:24.514 --> 32:29.101
You know, I've had other relationships like this.

32:29.500 --> 32:30.586
You may have heard talk.

32:31.302 --> 32:33.771
Oh, I rarely listen to anything anybody says.

32:34.682 --> 32:37.191
I didn't want you to think that I was hiding anything.

32:37.309 --> 32:39.546
- I want to be honest with you. 
- Thank you.

32:40.529 --> 32:43.954
There's something very unique about you, Paris,

32:44.681 --> 32:46.079
quite out of the ordinary.

32:46.822 --> 32:48.435
A lot of people have said I'm not ordinary.

32:54.056 --> 32:57.087
You know, I'm going to be very busy at Oxford.

32:58.531 --> 33:01.562
I've been writing down all the places that I wanted to take you,

33:01.674 --> 33:05.771
things you should see, but I'm afraid there's not enough time.

33:07.220 --> 33:11.112
So, I was thinking of going alone. Oh, I'd like you to go,

33:11.188 --> 33:13.630
but I don't want you to be bored.

33:13.973 --> 33:15.437
You've been writing down places?

33:15.575 --> 33:16.933
I'd forgotten how many there were.

33:19.907 --> 33:21.827
So, if you want to reassess,

33:22.866 --> 33:24.826
- I will completely understand. 
- Do you...

33:26.056 --> 33:29.312
- want to reassess? 
- No. I don't want to go alone,

33:30.091 --> 33:31.760
and I don't want to go with anyone else.

33:32.933 --> 33:34.341
But, then, I'm selfish.

33:35.369 --> 33:36.244
I get to be.

33:37.296 --> 33:39.185
After all, I'm... old.

33:41.369 --> 33:42.635
You're not so old.

33:47.581 --> 33:49.285
Hi. I'm looking for Asher Fleming.

33:49.716 --> 33:51.846
He's getting dressed. He should be out in a minute.

33:52.347 --> 33:53.002
Thank you.

33:59.896 --> 34:01.795
He'll be all yours in a minute, girlfriend.

34:05.025 --> 34:06.566
- Miss Gilmore. 
- Hello, Professor.

34:07.017 --> 34:07.904
- You ready? 
- That's okay.

34:08.199 --> 34:11.119
I'm going to go with Asher. We're going to do some more planning for England.

34:11.190 --> 34:12.511
England? But I thought...

34:12.618 --> 34:15.195
- Andrea, what brought you here? 
- Mom called.

34:15.302 --> 34:17.936
Paris, Rory, this is my granddaughter, Andrea.

34:20.005 --> 34:23.194
Hey, there. Wow. It's really nice to meet you.

34:24.060 --> 34:27.313
I'm gonna be going home now because there's no rest for the wicked.

34:27.472 --> 34:28.699
- So I'll see you at home. 
- See you there.

34:29.069 --> 34:32.576
I'll just see you in class there, Asher -- Professor.

34:32.960 --> 34:35.004
It's really nice meeting you. Bye.

34:37.619 --> 34:41.081
I love mud, I love wrestling, I love girls. This is everything I love.

34:41.264 --> 34:42.498
In one neat package.

34:44.864 --> 34:46.688
Here's our boy. You having a good time?

34:46.882 --> 34:48.213
Oh, I'm having a gay old time.

34:48.525 --> 34:51.444
You know, you read so much, I'm thinking of nicknaming you "Reads."

34:51.690 --> 34:53.199
- Good one. 
- Tough guy, huh?

34:53.338 --> 34:53.804
What?

34:54.039 --> 34:56.768
Listen, your mom has this thought she hasn't shared with you

34:56.866 --> 34:58.561
because she's afraid you wouldn't be into it.

34:58.689 --> 34:59.538
Oh yeah?

34:59.600 --> 35:01.121
She'd like you to walk her down the aisle.

35:01.340 --> 35:04.121
Usually it's the father that would do that, but he's worm food.

35:04.393 --> 35:05.058
I knew that.

35:05.571 --> 35:06.865
So, what do you say?

35:07.659 --> 35:09.571
- I don't think so. 
- She really wants you to.

35:09.851 --> 35:10.650
I really don't want to.

35:11.146 --> 35:12.805
- I'd like it, too. 
- Oh, you too?

35:12.933 --> 35:14.059
- Yeah. 
- I don't think so.

35:14.228 --> 35:16.128
It's a really short aisle. It'll be over in a flash.

35:16.251 --> 35:18.571
- Get Luke to do it. 
- She wants you to do it.

35:18.739 --> 35:20.418
I guess we're at a stalemate.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.390
I don't think we're at a stalemate.

35:22.963 --> 35:27.161
There's girls wallowing around in slimy dirt, and you're looking at me?

35:27.345 --> 35:29.398
- I don't want to tell your mom no. 
- Then I'll tell her.

35:29.553 --> 35:30.888
I don't want you telling her either.

35:31.113 --> 35:32.250
Want to pitch in for a telegram?

35:35.905 --> 35:38.594
Knock it off! Knock it off! Come on, knock it off!

35:39.901 --> 35:41.159
That's it. This whole group out.

35:44.821 --> 35:46.275
Best bachelor party ever!

35:49.168 --> 35:51.410
Oh, my God. I hate nature.

35:52.588 --> 35:53.556
Jackson!

35:54.355 --> 35:56.135
- What are you doing here? 
- What are you doing here?

35:56.279 --> 35:58.875
I'm sleeping with the zucchini. Didn't you tell her that I was sleeping with the zucchini?

35:59.013 --> 36:00.785
She had a little trouble grasping that concept.

36:01.122 --> 36:02.981
I do not want you to sleep with the zucchini.

36:03.093 --> 36:05.229
- You said it was important. 
- They are.

36:05.408 --> 36:07.231
And to keep them safe, no matter what it takes.

36:07.594 --> 36:10.261
- And there's a possibility of a cold front. 
- I told her about the cold front.

36:10.354 --> 36:11.311
That's why you have heaters.

36:11.471 --> 36:13.482
But the heaters could fail, so I'm here to service them.

36:13.615 --> 36:15.464
- So technically, you're sleeping with the heaters? 
- I guess so.

36:15.591 --> 36:17.757
- But I don't want you to do that either. 
- It's cold.

36:17.910 --> 36:19.186
Sit down here. It's warm down here.

36:19.492 --> 36:21.701
Jackson, I love you. I love that you're doing this,

36:21.808 --> 36:25.335
but I also feel like I should call the guys with butterfly nets to come get you...

36:25.597 --> 36:27.593
- and me and all of us. 
- Well...

36:28.273 --> 36:29.902
- I'm so sorry, guys. 
- For what?

36:29.989 --> 36:31.694
For freaking out about dumb things like zucchini

36:31.781 --> 36:35.365
and not realizing that people would respond in very loving and nutty ways.

36:35.601 --> 36:38.316
This is not the way to do this. We're too stressed out. We're not having fun.

36:38.493 --> 36:41.043
This whole inn experience is flying by.

36:42.036 --> 36:43.767
- Tonight it stops. 
- Sounds good to me.

36:43.895 --> 36:46.337
- It is nice and warm here. 
- Here's what we do.

36:46.465 --> 36:48.667
We each have to drop something off our list -- something big --

36:48.759 --> 36:50.782
and the others get to pick for the person,

36:50.874 --> 36:53.777
and the person cannot refuse a reasonable request to drop something.

36:53.863 --> 36:55.533
- Like a game. 
- And we all win.

36:55.671 --> 36:56.756
You're dropping the pillows.

36:56.941 --> 36:59.056
- Okay, the pillows are history. 
- Good.

36:59.230 --> 37:01.881
Okay, you are dropping two desserts off the menu.

37:02.045 --> 37:03.848
A selection of six is all people need.

37:03.966 --> 37:05.666
- I'll second that. 
- I can live with that.

37:05.763 --> 37:08.963
And Michel, you're no longer asking for 10 references from every person we're hiring.

37:09.055 --> 37:11.876
But they are all such imbeciles. How else will we know?

37:11.933 --> 37:13.254
- We're capping it at three. 
- Five.

37:13.341 --> 37:14.866
- Four. 
- I guess four's okay.

37:15.112 --> 37:17.042
It really is comfortable here.

37:17.416 --> 37:19.721
- I'm actually relieved about the pillows. 
- You'll do them later.

37:20.023 --> 37:21.282
Are you guys seeing these stars?

37:22.080 --> 37:23.494
Oh, wow, beautiful.

37:24.291 --> 37:26.637
I haven't looked at the stars in ages.

37:26.940 --> 37:29.751
That's another rule. We all have to look at the stars more often.

37:29.859 --> 37:31.957
- Done. 
- I'm very comfortable.

37:32.121 --> 37:32.731
Me too.

37:54.598 --> 37:57.803
Tonight I got into a fight at a strip club with my nephew.

37:58.644 --> 37:59.241
A fight.

38:00.307 --> 38:02.233
I haven't been in a fight since sixth grade.

38:02.524 --> 38:04.516
Vince Williams called me a doodyhead.

38:04.822 --> 38:05.948
I took it very personally.

38:06.861 --> 38:09.989
But you know what? Tonight was good. Tonight something happened to me.

38:10.070 --> 38:13.077
I achieved this great sense of calm.

38:13.998 --> 38:16.015
No more anger, no more frustration.

38:17.132 --> 38:19.640
Live and let live. You are who you are.

38:20.286 --> 38:22.943
I cannot change that, and I'm gonna stop trying.

38:23.946 --> 38:25.027
I wish I'd felt this earlier.

38:26.108 --> 38:27.658
Then I wouldn't have dragged you down here.

38:27.933 --> 38:29.194
I apologize for that.

38:29.905 --> 38:33.147
But, I mean, if you really hate your mother that much,

38:33.690 --> 38:38.083
then you shouldn't be here, you shouldn't walk her down the aisle,

38:38.185 --> 38:39.313
and you shouldn't go to her wedding.

38:39.670 --> 38:41.314
- I don't hate my mother. 
- You don't?

38:42.522 --> 38:44.779
Well, then, I don't get it.

38:44.944 --> 38:47.401
Why weren't you coming -- because of me? You hate me that much?

38:49.931 --> 38:50.729
I don't hate you.

38:52.971 --> 38:56.453
- I came here because of you. 
- Stop that.

38:56.586 --> 38:58.046
You said it was important to you. Remember?

38:58.195 --> 39:00.641
- I remember. I didn't think you were listening. 
- I was listening.

39:00.702 --> 39:02.859
So, you don't hate your mom, you don't hate me, so...

39:04.036 --> 39:04.770
why weren't you coming?

39:07.098 --> 39:10.845
No. Rory still? That's ancient history. You haven't seen her in a year.

39:11.030 --> 39:13.288
I saw her when I was here a few months ago.

39:13.437 --> 39:14.896
I didn't know that. So, what happened?

39:15.223 --> 39:18.474
Nothing. I told her...

39:20.687 --> 39:21.162
What?

39:22.602 --> 39:23.665
I told her I loved her.

39:26.004 --> 39:27.624
- What did she say? 
- Nothing.

39:27.896 --> 39:29.411
What, you just said it and walked away?

39:29.580 --> 39:31.562
No. I got in my car and left.

39:31.689 --> 39:33.118
- You just dropped the bomb and ran? 
- I drove.

39:33.215 --> 39:34.536
You didn't want stick around to see what she said?

39:34.609 --> 39:37.326
No. And obviously, she had nothing to say.

39:37.393 --> 39:37.879
How do you know?

39:38.038 --> 39:41.770
She could have contacted me anytime in the last three months, but she didn't.

39:41.884 --> 39:43.732
What are you talking about? You change your phone number weekly.

39:44.402 --> 39:48.002
- The ball was in her court. 
- Oh, Jess, come on.

39:48.095 --> 39:50.076
You did this completely wrong.

39:50.193 --> 39:56.312
Open two-way communication is the foundation of love, and you cut that off.

39:56.901 --> 39:59.394
I had this friend -- let's call him Phillip --

39:59.471 --> 40:02.907
who thought expressing intimacy was a favor to his partner,

40:03.014 --> 40:07.924
but expressions of intimacy should be given freely and frequently.

40:08.000 --> 40:10.637
He loved Judy, but he used his love as a bargaining tool.

40:10.746 --> 40:13.448
- Who the hell is Judy? 
- Phillip's wife. We call her Judy.

40:13.561 --> 40:15.318
- I wasn't bargaining. 
- You were bargaining.

40:15.425 --> 40:18.231
You had expectations out of line with what you deserved. You don't nurture.

40:18.307 --> 40:20.065
Where are you getting this junk?

40:20.807 --> 40:23.428
- Life. I've lived. 
- What, in a Bette Midler movie?

40:23.594 --> 40:25.876
- I'm just trying to help you out. 
- Oh, please.

40:25.986 --> 40:29.040
- You are the most dysfunctional person I know. 
- Not anymore.

40:29.172 --> 40:31.327
Your marriage to Nicole -- nothing but weird.

40:31.431 --> 40:34.098
- I'm better now. 
- Yeah, right. Right.

40:35.804 --> 40:38.250
Oh, man. We're just a couple of losers.

40:38.505 --> 40:40.069
Well, things change, my friend.

40:40.693 --> 40:41.291
Oh, yeah?

40:42.735 --> 40:43.487
Stay tuned.

40:50.876 --> 40:52.377
You really told her you loved her? 

41:02.676 --> 41:06.177
- Sook, Sook. 
- Where are we?

41:06.276 --> 41:07.839
Michel, wake up.

41:08.044 --> 41:09.702
Hon, wake up.

41:10.660 --> 41:12.416
- What happened? 
- We slept with the zucchini.

41:12.683 --> 41:14.361
We slept with the zucchini?

41:14.562 --> 41:15.641
We slept with the zucchini.

41:15.857 --> 41:17.941
I slept good. I mean, really good.

41:18.059 --> 41:18.703
Me too.

41:18.970 --> 41:20.388
That's the best night's sleep I've had in weeks.

41:20.501 --> 41:22.989
My back isn't hurting. It's perfect now.

41:23.127 --> 41:24.592
It's like a magic zucchini patch.

41:24.904 --> 41:27.209
- How are the zucchini? 
- They can't wait to be soup.

41:35.523 --> 41:36.460
Luke, hi.

41:36.777 --> 41:38.053
Hey. Where are you coming from?

41:38.364 --> 41:40.316
Oh, you know, the zucchini patch.

41:41.376 --> 41:43.617
It's a long story. No, it's short.

41:43.803 --> 41:45.666
- I slept in the zucchini patch. 
- Okay.

41:47.981 --> 41:49.455
So, what are you doing here?

41:49.630 --> 41:51.431
- Well, I wanted to talk to you. 
- Okay.

41:51.682 --> 41:54.318
- I got that wedding coming up, Liz's wedding. 
- I know.

41:54.401 --> 41:58.354
I know you're busy with your to-do list and all, but I think you could use a little break.

41:58.523 --> 41:59.900
Oh, I could use a little break.

42:00.406 --> 42:02.265
- Take a break with me. Come to the wedding. 
- Really?

42:02.393 --> 42:04.278
It should be fun. There'll be turkey legs.

42:04.349 --> 42:05.511
- Oh, well, sure. 
- Yes?

42:05.901 --> 42:08.184
- Yes. 
- Good. Yes, good.

42:10.053 --> 42:10.790
All right, then.

42:11.286 --> 42:14.384
I'll meet you at your house. We'll walk over together, okay?

42:14.502 --> 42:15.336
- Great. 
- Okay.

42:15.685 --> 42:17.201
- Good. I'll see you then. 
- Or before then.

42:17.697 --> 42:19.434
- Either way is good. 
- Yeah, me too.

42:19.760 --> 42:23.256
Oh, and you don't have to wear a fruity outfit.

42:23.506 --> 42:25.781
- Oh, I'm gonna be a little fruity. 
- That's good, too.

42:44.463 --> 42:45.760
What is it with you?

42:55.749 --> 42:57.680
Here. I'm done with them. Enjoy.
