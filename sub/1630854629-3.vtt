01:00.920 --> 01:03.400
You're making a mistake, Belova.

01:05.240 --> 01:07.520
Someone poisoned the head of MI6.

01:08.360 --> 01:10.320
Russia is the prime suspect.

01:11.480 --> 01:13.880
Is there something
you want to tell me, Kara?

01:14.480 --> 01:17.200
What makes you think
it's got anything to do with me?

01:17.840 --> 01:20.920
I'm retired. You threw me out, remember?

01:24.960 --> 01:26.880
Then what are you doing in London, Kara?

01:43.320 --> 01:45.640
These men were on your team in Baku,

01:46.760 --> 01:48.800
where you first met Adam Lawrence.

02:07.160 --> 02:09.160
Stay away from him, Kara.

02:11.840 --> 02:15.240
If you do anything
that the British can lay at our door,

02:15.320 --> 02:18.120
we'll make sure
you disappear without a trace.

02:21.480 --> 02:23.800
It's not as if anyone will miss you.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.200
- Where's the file?
-In my bag.

07:29.840 --> 07:31.520
-You've checked it out?
-Yes.

07:32.280 --> 07:35.720
It's pretty damning.
Gives you all the leverage you need.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.120
Keep it.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.680
You need to make the approach to Gratz.

07:41.720 --> 07:44.720
No. The SVR threatened me.
They sent Belova.

07:45.240 --> 07:48.760
I got what you asked for.
Now I need to complete my own mission.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.480
Don't be like that, Little Bee.

07:51.880 --> 07:54.160
It's not much good to me
unless you finish the job.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.600
I can buy you more time with Belova,
but you have to do this for me.

08:00.440 --> 08:02.120
Make sure Gratz gets it today.

18:08.400 --> 18:11.520
You said
you delivered the message to Gratz.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.880
Of course I delivered it.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.440
Then you must be losing your touch.

18:16.520 --> 18:20.200
She hasn't pulled out of the race.
I need you to talk to her again.

18:20.280 --> 18:21.880
I did what you asked.

18:22.400 --> 18:25.560
If you want Gratz out of the running,

18:25.640 --> 18:27.480
then take this to a journalist.

18:27.560 --> 18:29.240
I'm sure you know a few hundred.

18:29.760 --> 18:31.120
Did you talk to Belova?

18:32.960 --> 18:34.320
Lawrence has connected us.

18:34.400 --> 18:36.600
He came to see me, asking about you.

18:37.240 --> 18:39.920
He told me to call the police
if you approached me.

18:42.200 --> 18:43.880
He's warning you off.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.680
If he had anything concrete on us--

18:46.760 --> 18:50.240
You don't understand, Kara.
This has to work.

18:51.440 --> 18:54.240
And I can't make it happen
if I'm getting heat from MI6.

18:54.320 --> 18:55.920
What are you talking about?

18:56.560 --> 18:57.600
What is this?

19:00.680 --> 19:01.880
You're full of shit.

19:02.520 --> 19:05.040
You don't have any sway in Moscow, do you?

19:17.880 --> 19:19.320
My money is frozen.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.320
I'm persona non grata in Russia.

19:23.720 --> 19:26.800
Once Kirby is prime minister,
then I'll gift wrap him to the Kremlin.

19:26.880 --> 19:28.520
When this succeeds,

19:29.440 --> 19:31.280
all is forgiven.

19:31.360 --> 19:33.720
No more looking over our shoulders, Kara.

19:34.480 --> 19:35.800
You used me.

19:36.360 --> 19:37.960
I can't help you, Anton.

19:40.720 --> 19:42.400
Then you leave me no choice.

19:42.920 --> 19:46.320
I'll have to turn you in for
the attempted murder of Martin Angelis.

19:49.280 --> 19:50.880
But I'm not done yet.

19:53.640 --> 19:54.800
Yes, you are, Kara.
