VINCENT: <i>Previously on</i>
Beauty & the Beast...

00:01.785 --> 00:04.035
VINCENT: Come on, Braxton,
what do you want from me?

00:04.038 --> 00:05.437
Well, it isn't what <i>I</i> want.

00:05.439 --> 00:06.839
It's what the buyer wants.

00:06.841 --> 00:07.973
Please don't tell me
there's another

00:07.975 --> 00:09.107
beast out there.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.343
Are you sure
that this is Braxton?

00:11.345 --> 00:13.145
DNA and dental records match.

00:13.147 --> 00:15.314
Seems we have
another beast on our hands.

00:15.316 --> 00:17.016
Braxton said he
had a client from

00:17.018 --> 00:18.684
a foreign country
that was interested

00:18.686 --> 00:20.653
in <i>one</i> of Muirfield's assets.

00:20.655 --> 00:23.389
What was the name of the client?
A crown prince? That's

00:23.391 --> 00:25.658
the fourth cabal member? How the
hell are we gonna get to him?

00:25.660 --> 00:28.560
There's no beast.
It's Braxton-- he's alive.

00:28.562 --> 00:30.162
(gunshot)
(people screaming)

00:30.164 --> 00:31.664
You're gonna be okay.

00:31.666 --> 00:32.998
Did you catch him?

00:33.000 --> 00:34.033
No.

00:34.035 --> 00:35.701
I turned the names over to DHS.

00:35.703 --> 00:37.670
Word came down
from the top-- DHS

00:37.672 --> 00:38.938
will never make
a deal with Vincent.

00:38.940 --> 00:40.439
The fight's over.
We lost.

00:40.441 --> 00:42.574
Here.
It's your new life.

00:42.576 --> 00:45.144
It has to end, Vincent,
one way or the other.

00:45.146 --> 00:47.780
I got to stop Braxton
before he does something major.

00:58.133 --> 01:00.100
I just really hate to lose
your business, Cat,

01:00.102 --> 01:01.802
especially after
all these years.

01:01.804 --> 01:03.270
I know, I'm sorry.

01:03.272 --> 01:04.805
I mean, if it helps,
I can...

01:04.807 --> 01:06.640
I can certainly waive
some of the bank fees.

01:06.642 --> 01:10.143
No, that isn't what this
about Max, really, trust me.

01:10.145 --> 01:11.378
I just...

01:11.380 --> 01:12.779
I need to make sure

01:12.781 --> 01:14.114
that my sister's taken care of.

01:14.116 --> 01:16.049
Taken care of?

01:16.051 --> 01:17.451
Cat, is everything all right?

01:17.453 --> 01:18.885
Everything is fine.

01:18.887 --> 01:20.387
It is. I can't

01:20.389 --> 01:22.089
really talk about it,

01:22.091 --> 01:24.992
but thank you for
everything, truly.

01:24.994 --> 01:26.960
Sure.
Take care.

01:26.962 --> 01:28.328
You, too.

01:30.566 --> 01:33.267
How much cash
we talking about?

01:33.269 --> 01:36.270
I mean, four-wheel drives don't
resell great in Jersey, man.

01:36.272 --> 01:38.639
(grunts)
Caddies, Lincolns, okay, but...

01:38.641 --> 01:42.242
Come on, it's in good condition.
Low mileage.

01:42.244 --> 01:44.945
You know, blue book
says it's worth 25.

01:44.947 --> 01:46.446
(chuckles)
Yeah, well,

01:46.448 --> 01:47.914
people who come here
don't do blue book.

01:47.916 --> 01:50.817
They just do cash.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.519
All right, I'll tell you what...

01:52.521 --> 01:53.954
I'll give you 15 grand.

01:53.956 --> 01:57.124
15? You kidding me?
Come on, pal,

01:57.126 --> 01:59.426
I'm leaving town, okay?
The cash is for a friend

01:59.428 --> 02:02.529
who's sacrificed
a lot for me, and...

02:02.531 --> 02:04.531
(sighs)
All right, how about 20?

02:05.434 --> 02:06.933
How about I call the cops?

02:08.270 --> 02:09.669
Maybe we find out, you know,

02:09.672 --> 02:11.271
why you're so hard up to sell?

02:11.273 --> 02:12.673
What, you threatening me?

02:12.675 --> 02:14.675
No, just doing business.
You know,

02:14.677 --> 02:16.143
got to make a living.

02:16.145 --> 02:19.279
Yeah, well,
I don't care about cops

02:19.281 --> 02:21.815
or DHS or FBI

02:21.817 --> 02:24.518
or anyone else
who's after me, for that matter.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.020
You know what, Dave...

02:27.022 --> 02:30.157
you ever seen a guy's heart get
ripped right out of his chest?

02:30.159 --> 02:31.525
Uh...

02:31.527 --> 02:33.293
'Cause I have.

02:33.295 --> 02:35.796
And it looks like it hurts
like a son of a bitch.

02:35.798 --> 02:38.065
20's good.

02:38.067 --> 02:39.700
Yeah.

02:41.136 --> 02:43.303
Hundreds will be fine.

02:45.407 --> 02:47.074
Thanks.

02:48.711 --> 02:50.377
REPORTER:
With the U.N. in session Tuesday

02:50.379 --> 02:51.978
and foreign dignitaries
pouring in...

02:51.980 --> 02:54.448
This thing is taking
forever to load.

02:54.450 --> 02:56.183
Why'd I ever sell my computers?

02:56.185 --> 02:57.684
Wait, what do you mean,
that's classified?

02:57.686 --> 02:59.453
I'm the captain of
a freaking precinct.

02:59.455 --> 03:02.923
City officials are expecting
road closures and traffic jams.

03:02.925 --> 03:05.092
And how am I supposed to prove
Braxton's setting Vincent up

03:05.094 --> 03:07.194
if I can't even find him,
let alone prove he's alive?

03:07.196 --> 03:09.329
Hey, how am I supposed to figure
out what he's gonna blow up

03:09.331 --> 03:11.431
if I can't get the
prince's motorcade route?

03:11.433 --> 03:13.433
Then transfer me to
someone who <i>can</i> help me.

03:13.435 --> 03:15.369
Come on, it's just
city surveillance,

03:15.371 --> 03:16.870
it's not even high-res.

03:16.872 --> 03:18.338
Fine, if you won't give me

03:18.340 --> 03:19.973
Agent Dylan's cell,
just transfer me to her.

03:19.975 --> 03:22.576
Hey, can you
turn that off, please?

03:22.578 --> 03:24.311
Unless the news is gonna
tell me how the prince

03:24.313 --> 03:26.380
is getting into the city.
Yeah, we're not that lucky.

03:26.382 --> 03:27.581
(computer beeps)

03:27.583 --> 03:29.716
Unbelievable.

03:29.718 --> 03:30.917
It froze again.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.519
They hung up on me again.

03:33.956 --> 03:35.956
(sighs)

03:35.958 --> 03:37.724
We're screwed.

03:37.726 --> 03:38.792
No, Cat and Vincent are screwed,

03:38.794 --> 03:40.093
and they're counting on us.

03:40.095 --> 03:42.028
I mean, they should
just use their aliases

03:42.030 --> 03:43.830
and get out of town now.
But no,

03:43.832 --> 03:45.232
they're not going anywhere

03:45.234 --> 03:47.567
until we stop Braxton
from killing the prince.

03:47.569 --> 03:50.303
Yeah, and all the other innocent
people who will die with him

03:50.305 --> 03:52.305
in whatever terrorist
plot he's got planned.

03:52.307 --> 03:54.141
Why does everything have
to be this complicated?

03:54.143 --> 03:55.909
Why can't we just find

03:55.911 --> 03:58.612
what we need to find so Cat and
Vincent can have a damn life?!

03:58.614 --> 04:00.280
Ow.

04:00.282 --> 04:02.482
Hey, hey...

04:02.484 --> 04:03.817
come on.

04:03.819 --> 04:06.253
I'll get you some ice.

04:06.255 --> 04:08.455
Only if you put it in a drink.

04:08.457 --> 04:10.223
That's not gonna solve anything.

04:10.225 --> 04:13.059
Yeah, well we're not
solving anything, anyway.

04:13.061 --> 04:15.228
I mean, let's face it, all we're
trying to do is find Braxton

04:15.230 --> 04:17.230
before Cat and
Vincent get caught

04:17.232 --> 04:19.766
or, worse, killed
trying to stop him.

04:19.767 --> 04:22.803
Look, this is their path, JT.

04:22.805 --> 04:25.739
All we can do is
just try and help them.

04:25.741 --> 04:27.974
Now you're sounding like Cat.
Yeah, well,

04:27.976 --> 04:29.576
maybe because she's right.

04:29.578 --> 04:30.944
Look, they've done
a lot of good, they've

04:30.946 --> 04:32.279
helped a lot of people,
but it's been

04:32.281 --> 04:33.780
at their expense and ours.

04:33.782 --> 04:36.049
We have to help them
finish this, JT.

04:36.051 --> 04:37.451
We have to help them

04:37.453 --> 04:40.620
stop the last person
who can make beasts.

04:40.622 --> 04:42.722
So we can all move on.

04:42.724 --> 04:45.926
Yeah.
Without Cat and Vincent.

04:54.470 --> 04:55.969
(rapid beeping)

04:55.971 --> 04:58.338
NURSE:
Heather, don't.

04:58.340 --> 04:59.573
I have to get out of here.
Jamal.

04:59.575 --> 05:00.907
What...

05:00.909 --> 05:02.476
You guys are not...
Come on, back in bed.

05:02.478 --> 05:03.510
You don't understand,
I have to see my sister.

05:03.512 --> 05:04.945
No! Jamal.

05:04.947 --> 05:06.813
(grunts)
Come on, just...

05:06.815 --> 05:07.948
for the afternoon.
Take it easy.

05:07.950 --> 05:09.516
Shh, shh.
Is this necessary?

05:09.518 --> 05:10.851
Restrain her.
No...

05:14.056 --> 05:16.022
They never listen.
Third time today.

05:18.427 --> 05:21.061
Heather?
Kyle.

05:21.063 --> 05:23.630
What the hell?
Untie me.

05:23.632 --> 05:25.599
When did this happen?
How did you get shot?

05:25.601 --> 05:27.393
Are you okay?

05:27.417 --> 05:29.370
Saturday, stupidly,
and yes, I'm fine. Now,

05:29.371 --> 05:30.770
will you get me out of here,
okay? I have to make sure

05:30.772 --> 05:32.439
that Cat and Vincent
are all right.

05:32.441 --> 05:35.208
Vincent's in jail.
Well, no, he was. Thanks to you.

05:35.210 --> 05:36.236
But then he broke out

05:36.260 --> 05:37.712
so he could try and catch
the guy who shot me.

05:37.713 --> 05:39.513
What? I'm lost.

05:39.515 --> 05:42.148
I forgive you.
For getting him arrested, I do.

05:42.150 --> 05:43.517
I know that you only did it
because you thought I was

05:43.519 --> 05:45.352
in trouble, but I can't
just sit on my ass

05:45.354 --> 05:47.220
worrying about Cat and Vincent,
so if you ever want to

05:47.222 --> 05:49.542
have sex with me again, you'll
get me the hell out of here.

05:51.527 --> 05:54.361
Please?

05:59.034 --> 06:01.401
(exhales)
Oh, boy. You know what,

06:01.403 --> 06:03.336
I think that chocolate mousse
was a bad idea.

06:03.338 --> 06:04.938
So why'd you
order it?

06:04.940 --> 06:06.506
Oh, you know,
last supper and all.

06:06.508 --> 06:07.741
Good point.

06:07.743 --> 06:09.142
Hi.
Valet ticket?

06:09.144 --> 06:10.477
Actually, we're
leaving with a friend.

06:10.479 --> 06:11.711
Okay, thanks.

06:11.713 --> 06:13.880
Thank you.

06:14.716 --> 06:16.550
Worried about Braxton?

06:16.552 --> 06:18.385
No, no.

06:18.387 --> 06:20.787
Tess and JT will come through.
We'll get him.

06:20.789 --> 06:23.323
Well, we got to get
the prince first.

06:23.325 --> 06:25.091
And not just to
stop the attack,

06:25.093 --> 06:27.060
but to make sure that he
testifies against Braxton.

06:27.062 --> 06:28.795
Yeah, and make sure
neither one of them

06:28.797 --> 06:31.097
ever try and make
another one of me.

06:33.201 --> 06:35.201
And then we can leave?
Yeah.

06:35.203 --> 06:36.436
Valet ticket?
Thanks.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.271
You saved
some cash for us, right?

06:38.273 --> 06:40.140
Yeah, enough
to get started.

06:40.142 --> 06:44.411
Okay, yeah. So after this,
we say our last good-byes?

06:44.413 --> 06:46.813
Hope I don't
cry again.

06:46.815 --> 06:50.216
Me, too.

06:50.218 --> 06:52.419
Okay, this is our ride.
You ready?

06:56.725 --> 06:59.192
I've got it.
Excuse me,

06:59.194 --> 07:00.961
are you Prince Abu's
personal assistant?

07:00.963 --> 07:02.228
Why, yes, I am.

07:02.230 --> 07:03.930
And you are?

07:05.801 --> 07:07.567
Nobody you want to mess with.

07:10.439 --> 07:12.639
Get in.
Come on.

07:20.749 --> 07:22.616
Who are you? What do you want?

07:22.618 --> 07:25.218
We want you to save
our happily ever after.

07:25.220 --> 07:27.654
(engine revs)
Now buckle up.

07:30.525 --> 07:32.859

07:44.395 --> 07:45.620
Okay, what is this?

07:45.621 --> 07:48.021
This is how your boss'
business partner, Peter Braxton,

07:48.023 --> 07:50.757
is trying to set me up to look
like some kind of terrorist.

07:50.759 --> 07:52.359
Who's Peter Braxton?

07:52.361 --> 07:54.261
You know who he is.
You're the advance planner

07:54.263 --> 07:57.130
for all the prince's trips.
You can't not know Braxton.

07:57.132 --> 07:58.999
Yeah, and, uh,
we got Ecklund over here

07:59.001 --> 08:02.369
and Garrus right here
next to Braxton.

08:02.371 --> 08:04.771
That's right, we know all
about your boss' connections.

08:04.773 --> 08:06.406
And we also know your boss
was the one who supplied

08:06.408 --> 08:09.042
the innocent victims
to their so-called cause.

08:09.044 --> 08:10.644
I don't know
what you're talking about.

08:10.646 --> 08:12.012
The hell you don't.

08:12.014 --> 08:13.780
Listen, we're
running out of time,

08:13.782 --> 08:16.049
okay? Tomorrow, in this city,

08:16.051 --> 08:17.684
there's a bomb
that's gonna go off.

08:17.686 --> 08:20.253
And all we know is that
Braxton is behind it

08:20.255 --> 08:21.921
and he's trying
to cover his tracks.

08:21.923 --> 08:24.424
And right now the last
track he's gonna cover

08:24.426 --> 08:27.327
is your boss. Garrus and
Ecklund are already dead,

08:27.329 --> 08:29.596
which means
the prince is next.

08:29.598 --> 08:31.631
And believe it or not,
we're trying to save him,

08:31.633 --> 08:33.799
but we won't do it
unless he helps us first.

08:33.802 --> 08:35.467
Helps you how?
We know he provided

08:35.470 --> 08:37.570
the people for
Braxton's experiments.

08:37.572 --> 08:39.139
We want names

08:39.140 --> 08:40.807
so that we can
have leverage on him.

08:40.808 --> 08:42.241
And so DHS can clear my name

08:42.244 --> 08:43.677
for all the things
that Braxton's done.

08:43.679 --> 08:45.578
The prince
has diplomatic immunity.

08:45.580 --> 08:48.148
It's not gonna matter
if your prince is dead, is it?

08:48.150 --> 08:50.283
And it's not gonna

08:50.285 --> 08:53.353
help you much, either, if more
people die in that attack.

08:55.624 --> 08:57.023
(sighs)

08:57.025 --> 08:59.859
The prince simply wanted
to protect his family.

08:59.861 --> 09:01.261
Braxton said that he could

09:01.263 --> 09:03.897
make his bodyguards unstoppable.

09:03.899 --> 09:06.266
But the prince would've
never asked them to volunteer

09:06.268 --> 09:08.635
had he known what Braxton
was really doing to them.

09:08.637 --> 09:11.504
All we know is that
good people ended up dead.

09:11.506 --> 09:14.674
And the prince was afraid
that if he said anything that

09:14.676 --> 09:17.177
Braxton would come after him.

09:17.179 --> 09:19.512
Which is exactly
what he's about to do.

09:22.884 --> 09:25.118
MAN: You can't get into
the city as it is,

09:25.120 --> 09:27.487
and now we got all these
freaking road closures.

09:27.489 --> 09:30.357
I mean, why-why can't
these, uh, these ambassadors

09:30.359 --> 09:33.660
or-or princes or-or whoever
the hell else is coming in,

09:33.662 --> 09:35.428
like, can't they just
Skype in or something?

09:35.430 --> 09:36.629
I mean, look at this,
this is a mess.

09:36.631 --> 09:38.365
I can't even park my truck.

09:38.367 --> 09:40.667
They're gonna ticket me
right here. This is nuts.

09:40.669 --> 09:43.570
Like, why-why isn't de Blasio
doing something...?

09:43.572 --> 09:47.006
♪ ♪

10:04.860 --> 10:06.760
So... we're good, right?

10:06.762 --> 10:09.396
Yeah, as long as you don't
get caught before tomorrow

10:09.398 --> 10:11.831
and as long as JT
can find Braxton

10:11.833 --> 10:13.867
and Tess
can find that route.

10:13.869 --> 10:15.935
Yeah, well, hopefully
Karim can help us out,

10:15.937 --> 10:17.737
although I got a feeling
DHS is probably

10:17.739 --> 10:18.972
the only one who
knows the route.

10:18.974 --> 10:20.940
Which means that
there is nothing left

10:20.942 --> 10:23.009
for us to do but wait.

10:23.011 --> 10:24.677
Yeah.

10:24.679 --> 10:27.247
Well, it might be good having
nothing to do for once.

10:27.249 --> 10:30.650
It's time to... tie
up some loose ends.

10:30.652 --> 10:33.653
It's strange having nothing
to do all of a sudden.

10:33.655 --> 10:35.855
I mean, we've spent
all this time running,

10:35.857 --> 10:37.690
scrambling
just to survive.

10:37.692 --> 10:39.325
I've kind of gotten used
to putting everything else

10:39.327 --> 10:41.628
in my life on hold.
Well, after tomorrow,

10:41.630 --> 10:44.998
we won't have to worry
about it, will we now? Hey.

10:45.000 --> 10:48.001
Rooftop, tonight. One last time.

10:49.805 --> 10:52.272
One last time.
Okay.

10:52.274 --> 10:54.474
Don't be late.

10:55.777 --> 10:57.777
(horn honking)
TESS: <i>Look, I'm trying</i>

10:57.779 --> 10:59.546
to figure out where the attack's
gonna be, too, okay?

10:59.548 --> 11:01.781
Okay. But what does a Saudi
prince have to do with it?

11:01.783 --> 11:03.616
And what makes you think
it's even connected?

11:03.618 --> 11:06.553
Look, I-I can't tell you that.
I just need you to trust me.

11:06.555 --> 11:09.322
(chuckles) Trust you? That's funny,
coming from the best friend

11:09.324 --> 11:10.659
of a terrorist's wife.

11:10.683 --> 11:12.092
Oh, come on.
Vincent's not a terrorist.

11:12.093 --> 11:13.866
No? Then why did he
break out of prison?

11:13.867 --> 11:16.412
To stop the attack, to prove
who the terrorist really is.

11:16.436 --> 11:17.364
Yeah, the dead guy.

11:17.365 --> 11:19.365
Braxton's not dead, okay?
If you'd stop wasting

11:19.367 --> 11:21.568
your resources on Vincent and
get your head out of your ass,

11:21.570 --> 11:23.803
you'd see I'm telling you the truth!
(knocking)

11:23.805 --> 11:25.138
Excuse me. Secure link is up.

11:25.140 --> 11:26.673
Secretary's waiting
on an update.

11:26.675 --> 11:28.208
All right, I'm on my
way. You want my help,

11:28.210 --> 11:30.310
Captain? You tell me
everything you know.

11:30.312 --> 11:32.212
Otherwise you get
nothing from me.

11:36.251 --> 11:37.817
(quietly):
Want to bet?

11:39.020 --> 11:40.987
All right, JT, this better work.

11:40.989 --> 11:42.689
KYLE:
<i>Let me help.</i>

11:42.691 --> 11:44.724
Careful with the shoulder.
No, we have to get this

11:44.726 --> 11:46.893
to Cat and Vincent, all right?
JT said they could be leaving

11:46.895 --> 11:49.429
as soon as tomorrow.
Here, hold this.

11:49.431 --> 11:53.066
(whistles)
Wait, taxi! Come on!

11:53.068 --> 11:56.436
(scoffs) Seriously? Damn it.
Heather, wait.

11:56.438 --> 11:58.204
We can't wait.
Come on, please.

11:58.206 --> 12:00.039
Wigs? Burner phones? Just
tell me what's going on here.

12:00.041 --> 12:01.908
Trust me, the less you know,
the better, all right?

12:01.910 --> 12:03.977
Just in case we get caught.
Caught doing what?

12:03.979 --> 12:06.946
Helping Vincent and Cat escape?
Is that what we're doing?

12:06.948 --> 12:09.349
Kyle, if I told you what was
really going on, you could get

12:09.351 --> 12:11.684
in a lot of trouble, okay?
Go-to-jail kind of trouble,

12:11.686 --> 12:14.020
'cause you'd be an accessory and
I really can't do that to you.

12:14.022 --> 12:17.457
Look, I screwed up last time,
okay? Part of why they're in

12:17.459 --> 12:19.192
whatever trouble they're in
is because of me.

12:19.194 --> 12:21.661
I trust you.
I believe you.

12:21.663 --> 12:23.296
I just want to get it right
this time.

12:27.068 --> 12:29.002
You are definitely
high-maintenance,

12:29.004 --> 12:31.271
you know that, don't you?
Yeah, I know.

12:31.273 --> 12:32.605
But I'm worth it.

12:32.607 --> 12:34.908
(horn honks)

12:35.710 --> 12:37.677
Taxi!

12:42.250 --> 12:44.183
Call me if
you need me.

12:44.185 --> 12:45.718
Put that sling back on.

12:45.720 --> 12:48.321
Right.

12:54.329 --> 12:56.896
(grunting)

13:00.468 --> 13:02.101
(keys jangle)

13:07.342 --> 13:09.309
Who are you?

13:09.311 --> 13:11.444
Oh, hi. You must be Catherine's
sister. It's Heather, right?

13:11.446 --> 13:14.314
Yeah.
CATHERINE: Well, I hope it's all right

13:14.316 --> 13:17.216
if I pay you in cash.

13:19.087 --> 13:21.487
Heather,
what are you doing here?

13:21.489 --> 13:22.969
You're supposed to be
at the hospital.

13:25.193 --> 13:27.093
Why are Mom's
things out?

13:27.095 --> 13:29.128
And your lease and...

13:33.034 --> 13:34.467
Last will and testament?
Okay,

13:34.469 --> 13:36.002
I can explain.
Is he a lawyer?

13:36.004 --> 13:37.136
Are you a lawyer?

13:37.138 --> 13:38.972
Yes.
Seriously?

13:38.974 --> 13:40.640
No, you know,
I am finally

13:40.642 --> 13:42.175
on board trying to
get you and Vincent

13:42.177 --> 13:43.710
your stupid happily ever after!

13:43.712 --> 13:45.178
And you're getting ready to die!

13:45.180 --> 13:46.180
Heather, wait!

13:51.820 --> 13:53.987
Sorry.

14:03.159 --> 14:04.825
(birds chirping)

14:04.827 --> 14:07.461
(indistinct chatter)

14:15.304 --> 14:16.971
Heather, I'm sorry.

14:16.973 --> 14:18.506
No. I am not
doing this again.

14:18.508 --> 14:20.007
You really want it
to end this way?

14:20.009 --> 14:21.842
(sighs)

14:21.844 --> 14:23.711
It's just...

14:23.713 --> 14:25.846
everything's happening so fast.

14:25.848 --> 14:28.482
I'm sorry. I didn't want you
to find out like that.

14:28.484 --> 14:31.252
Well, how else was I supposed
to find out, at your funeral?

14:31.254 --> 14:33.387
No, of course not. It's just...

14:33.389 --> 14:36.857
I wanted to make sure that
everything was taken care of,

14:36.859 --> 14:38.159
just in case.

14:38.161 --> 14:40.494
In case you die.
Heather, listen to me.

14:40.496 --> 14:43.097
I'm not planning on dying, okay?

14:43.099 --> 14:46.167
But... but it could happen.
Cat,

14:46.169 --> 14:48.802
don't say that.
I have to, because it's true.

14:48.804 --> 14:51.105
Obviously, Vincent and I
don't want that to happen,

14:51.107 --> 14:54.108
but... I don't know, Heather.
Looking over our shoulders

14:54.110 --> 14:56.010
all the time,
that's got to stop.

14:56.012 --> 14:58.412
I know, but...
Which means,

14:58.414 --> 15:01.415
one way or the other,
we are leaving, tomorrow.

15:01.417 --> 15:03.651
I just didn't want to leave
without making sure

15:03.653 --> 15:05.686
that you were taken care of.
I don't want to talk about this.

15:05.688 --> 15:07.087
Heather, we have
to talk about it.

15:07.089 --> 15:09.657
(exhales)

15:14.530 --> 15:16.197
(sighs)

15:16.199 --> 15:19.200
And it's not just Vincent
and I who have to move on.

15:19.202 --> 15:21.202
You do, too.

15:21.204 --> 15:23.137
I mean, come on,

15:23.139 --> 15:25.272
you all but put your life
on hold for me

15:25.274 --> 15:27.608
since you got back last year,
and the least I can do is

15:27.610 --> 15:29.009
help you get a fresh start.

15:29.011 --> 15:30.878
What? I don't
want your money.

15:30.880 --> 15:32.713
Well, too bad.

15:32.715 --> 15:35.516
I prepaid the lease
on the apartment,

15:35.518 --> 15:37.084
put it in your name,

15:37.086 --> 15:39.486
signed over my car,

15:39.488 --> 15:42.556
and I, uh...
I left you Mom's things.

15:42.558 --> 15:46.493
Pictures... Hey.

15:46.495 --> 15:50.564
(crying)
It's gonna be okay, Heath.

15:50.566 --> 15:52.199
It's gonna be okay.

15:52.201 --> 15:55.202
Vincent and I
really believe that.

15:55.204 --> 16:00.307
And, you know, it's
our only chance to be together.

16:00.309 --> 16:02.943
And... it's a chance for you

16:02.945 --> 16:05.579
to start taking care
of yourself again.

16:05.581 --> 16:07.548
Without getting shot.

16:07.550 --> 16:10.918
Or kidnapped or caged,
Hmm.

16:10.920 --> 16:13.988
terrorized, punched, kicked...
(laughs)

16:13.990 --> 16:15.623
See?

16:15.625 --> 16:18.592
Things are looking
better already.

16:23.466 --> 16:25.966
JT:
<i>No, Tess, just copy</i>

16:25.968 --> 16:28.469
the IP address, and it'll be
like you're on Dylan's computer,

16:28.471 --> 16:31.839
okay? Then just search her files
for the motorcade route.

16:31.841 --> 16:33.340
VINCENT:
JT?

16:33.342 --> 16:36.143
Vincent. Uh...

16:36.145 --> 16:38.145
(quietly): I haven't found Braxton yet.
What do I tell him?

16:38.147 --> 16:41.315
Don't worry.
You'll find him.

16:42.318 --> 16:43.350
Beast hearing.

16:43.352 --> 16:44.952
How quickly one forgets.

16:44.954 --> 16:48.856
(sighs) Call you back.
Uh, get that route.

16:48.858 --> 16:51.492
Vincent, look,
I'm-I'm sorry.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.460
I-I feel
like I'm letting you down.

16:53.462 --> 16:56.263
I-I just can't find the guy,
anywhere,

16:56.265 --> 16:58.966
and-and I know if I don't,
then you're gonna take the fall,

16:58.968 --> 17:00.301
so...
So,

17:00.303 --> 17:03.537
maybe this will help.

17:03.539 --> 17:05.638
What is it?

17:13.182 --> 17:14.647
A new laptop?

17:14.650 --> 17:16.150
Okay, not just
any laptop.

17:16.152 --> 17:18.252
I mean, this thing is
top of the line, man.

17:18.253 --> 17:21.221
It's got facial recognition
software installed,

17:21.223 --> 17:23.891
which you need, right? So...
(chuckles)

17:23.893 --> 17:26.126
I mean, this is fantastic.

17:26.127 --> 17:28.929
Uh, it must've cost
a fortune.

17:28.931 --> 17:32.132
Eh. Well, no, it's nothing
compared to what you had before,

17:32.134 --> 17:35.002
before you had to sell it
all off, you know, so...

17:37.206 --> 17:38.772
Wait a minute,

17:38.774 --> 17:40.140
why are you

17:40.142 --> 17:41.308
giving me this?

17:41.310 --> 17:45.179
To help you find Braxton,
of course.

17:46.082 --> 17:48.315
That's not true.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.018
You know what, forget it.
I don't want it.

17:51.020 --> 17:53.020
What? Come on.
No.

17:53.022 --> 17:56.023
You think I'm stupid? You think
I don't know what you're doing?

17:56.025 --> 17:59.193
Okay, we've been through this.
You know I got to leave.

17:59.195 --> 18:01.328
I mean, I just...
I thought you understood.

18:01.330 --> 18:03.564
Yeah, but that doesn't mean
I like it, okay?!

18:03.566 --> 18:06.567
We grew up together.

18:06.569 --> 18:08.869
I-I've been by your side
every step of the way,

18:08.871 --> 18:11.338
living in the shadows,
keeping you alive.

18:11.340 --> 18:13.073
And now, what, y-you're leaving

18:13.075 --> 18:15.109
and you give me
a freakin' laptop?!

18:19.215 --> 18:22.449
I'm sorry. It's just... hard.

18:22.451 --> 18:24.818
That's all.

18:24.820 --> 18:26.854
I mean,
I've known you all my life.

18:26.856 --> 18:29.056
We're like brothers.
Come on.

18:29.058 --> 18:30.557
We <i>are</i> brothers.

18:31.894 --> 18:33.794
And I don't want to lose
another one

18:33.796 --> 18:35.429
any more than you do.

18:37.833 --> 18:39.867
Come here, buddy.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.368
(grunts)

18:47.576 --> 18:49.743
(sighs)

18:52.515 --> 18:55.149
Well, this sucks.
(chuckles)

18:55.151 --> 18:57.284
Here.

19:00.823 --> 19:03.791
(siren wailing)

19:16.305 --> 19:20.474
(indistinct chatter)

19:28.651 --> 19:31.618
(siren wailing in distance)

19:33.088 --> 19:35.355
JT got me
into Agent Dylan's computer,

19:35.357 --> 19:37.791
and I found out the prince flies
into LaGuardia tomorrow

19:37.793 --> 19:39.593
at noon, then motorcades
to the Pierre.

19:39.595 --> 19:41.428
You sure he's using the Queensboro?
Positive,

19:41.430 --> 19:43.464
'cause they're already sweeping
it for explosives.

19:43.466 --> 19:44.798
But they're not clearing the
tunnel. So it's his only way

19:44.800 --> 19:47.935
into the city. Although
how Braxton plans

19:47.937 --> 19:49.503
on blowing it up,
I have no idea,

19:49.505 --> 19:51.104
'cause it'll have been cleared
by tomorrow.

19:51.106 --> 19:53.373
Still, it does everything
Braxton wants it to do:

19:53.375 --> 19:55.209
it covers up the prince's
murder in what looks

19:55.211 --> 19:55.942
like a terrorist attack.

19:55.966 --> 19:57.712
Yeah, which Vincent
gets blamed for,

19:57.713 --> 19:59.513
unless we can somehow stop it.

19:59.515 --> 20:01.782
So we have to get to him
before he gets to the bridge.

20:01.784 --> 20:04.384
How? I mean, I can't
exactly pull him over.

20:04.386 --> 20:06.453
He's a head of state.
And DHS isn't

20:06.455 --> 20:08.288
gonna believe me,
so they won't stop him.

20:08.290 --> 20:11.091
Right. Which means
we have to do it.

20:11.093 --> 20:13.227
All right, let's go.
No, Tess.

20:13.229 --> 20:15.796
I meant Vincent and I have to.

20:15.798 --> 20:18.198
I'm not gonna sit around and
do nothing while someone tries

20:18.200 --> 20:19.967
to blow up a damn bridge.
It isn't just someone--

20:19.969 --> 20:22.803
it's Braxton. And nobody else
knows he's alive,

20:22.805 --> 20:24.972
so we're the only ones who have
a chance of catching him.

20:24.974 --> 20:26.373
No, Cat...
Tess,

20:26.375 --> 20:27.674
you said yourself

20:27.676 --> 20:29.009
that nobody would believe you.

20:29.011 --> 20:32.479
There's nothing
else you can do.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.515
We will stop him.

20:34.517 --> 20:36.383
I promise you.

20:38.254 --> 20:40.254
You better.

20:42.525 --> 20:44.491
Don't.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.559
Don't.

20:47.096 --> 20:48.362
I'm not saying good-bye

20:48.364 --> 20:49.796
'cause I plan
on seeing you again.

20:49.798 --> 20:51.064
Understand?

20:54.503 --> 20:55.769
Okay.

21:05.915 --> 21:08.715

21:55.598 --> 21:58.999
Yeah, we'll find
a new rooftop.

21:59.001 --> 22:01.134
Maybe.

22:01.136 --> 22:02.803
How did today go?

22:02.805 --> 22:06.239
More tears,
just like you said.

22:06.241 --> 22:08.108
Tess wouldn't even
let me say it.

Ah, sounds

22:20.356 --> 22:22.723
It's a lot to give up, isn't it?

22:22.725 --> 22:25.225
Yeah.

22:25.227 --> 22:28.295
More than we ever
wanted to.

22:28.297 --> 22:30.931
But, you know, I still believe
it's gonna work out.

22:30.933 --> 22:33.000
How do you know?

22:33.002 --> 22:35.402
I don't.

22:37.439 --> 22:39.840
(sighs)

22:39.842 --> 22:43.744
Um... Tess-- she, uh... she
figured out what the target is.

22:43.746 --> 22:45.512
It's the Queensboro Bridge.

22:45.514 --> 22:47.514
That makes
complete sense.

22:47.516 --> 22:50.150
JT just found out how
Braxton's planning to escape.

22:50.152 --> 22:53.020
Apparently, he pilots his own
jet, and it just got moved

22:53.022 --> 22:56.556
to a private airstrip about 45
minutes west of the Queensboro.

22:56.558 --> 22:58.859
Well, it seems like
Braxton's sticking around

22:58.861 --> 23:00.927
just long enough
to see that bridge blow.

23:01.997 --> 23:04.131
I know it's not gonna be easy

23:04.133 --> 23:06.099
for us to get to
the prince first.

23:06.101 --> 23:08.935
Since when has it ever
been easy for us?

23:08.937 --> 23:11.371
All right, good point,
smarty-pants.

23:11.373 --> 23:14.274
(laughs)

23:16.679 --> 23:20.514
This really is it,
isn't it?

23:20.516 --> 23:24.084
We are never
coming back here.

23:24.086 --> 23:26.586
No.

it might be the last

innocent people.

26:08.952 --> 26:10.452
What?
VINCENT: Listen to me.

26:10.454 --> 26:12.120
You're going testify against
Braxton, you're gonna prove

26:12.122 --> 26:14.489
that he's the one
that killed the innocent people

26:14.491 --> 26:16.525

you're telling the truth?

Come on. Decide now.

26:24.568 --> 26:26.902

it's all over for all of us.

26:26.904 --> 26:29.004
You have to believe me.

26:29.006 --> 26:32.507

was up to. I still don't.

26:32.509 --> 26:33.909
But you're the only person
who can help us

26:33.911 --> 26:36.044

again. Please.

It's too late to turn around.
We're already on the bridge.

27:17.988 --> 27:20.155

it up any second.

driver to stop the car.

never done this before.

33:01.320 --> 33:03.520
how much
they went through.

33:07.793 --> 33:10.060
They were heroes.

33:10.062 --> 33:12.429
That's all there is to it.

33:12.431 --> 33:15.432
It's the way they lived...

33:16.902 --> 33:19.069
...and that's how they died.

33:19.071 --> 33:21.604
♪ Love me, my darling ♪

33:21.606 --> 33:25.809
♪ Like the first day
of winter... ♪

33:25.811 --> 33:29.045
At least they were together,

33:29.047 --> 33:32.349
which is all
they ever really wanted anyway.

33:34.619 --> 33:38.722
♪ Of one single candle ♪

33:38.724 --> 33:43.593
♪ A love we can not handle ♪

33:43.595 --> 33:47.864
♪ Will melt us together ♪

33:47.866 --> 33:53.470
♪ And make it all right ♪

33:59.911 --> 34:04.581
♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. ♪

34:06.785 --> 34:08.752
TESS: You have to give yourself
some time.

34:08.754 --> 34:10.353
We all do.

34:10.355 --> 34:12.489
There are no
shortcuts here.

34:12.491 --> 34:15.525
I know. It's just...

34:15.527 --> 34:19.529
I'm not saying it's harder for
me, because it's not, but...

34:19.531 --> 34:22.931
at least you can
go back to your job

34:22.934 --> 34:26.803
and do something with
your life, but me?

34:26.804 --> 34:29.739
I don't even know where to
start after all these years.

34:29.741 --> 34:32.175
MAN:
Excuse me.

34:32.177 --> 34:33.443
Professor Forbes?

34:33.445 --> 34:36.212
Yeah?
My condolences.

34:36.214 --> 34:37.847
I am so sorry for your loss.

34:37.849 --> 34:39.916
Thank you.

34:39.918 --> 34:41.518
How did you know, uh...?

34:41.520 --> 34:43.219
Actually, I didn't know
either one of them,

34:43.221 --> 34:45.255
at least not directly.

34:46.525 --> 34:48.992
Forgive me if this seems
awkward, but Dr. Keller told me

34:48.994 --> 34:50.994
this would be
the best place to find you.

34:50.996 --> 34:53.029
Wait. What?
Yes.

34:53.031 --> 34:54.697
He called and asked
if the job offer

34:54.699 --> 34:56.833
that we extended several weeks
ago was still good,

34:56.835 --> 35:00.036
and if it was, thought you might
be interested in it now.

35:00.038 --> 35:03.506
What job offer?
Who are you?

35:03.508 --> 35:05.475
Sorry. I'm Frank Buck,

35:05.477 --> 35:07.677
Senior Vice President
at Tanirushi Biotech.

35:07.679 --> 35:09.481
Tanirushi?

35:09.505 --> 35:11.115
Wait, when did you talk
to Vincent?

35:11.116 --> 35:14.350
A couple days ago, I guess,
just before the accident.

35:14.352 --> 35:16.986
Yeah, but how'd he know to send
you here, to his own funeral?

35:16.988 --> 35:18.288
I don't know.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.056
We just got the message.

35:32.404 --> 35:34.704
(sighs)
(door closes)

35:46.985 --> 35:48.831
I don't even know

35:48.854 --> 35:50.854
where she kept the stupid vases.
Hey, hey.

35:54.326 --> 35:57.060
I don't know.

35:57.062 --> 35:59.562
It hurts so much
I can't even breathe.

35:59.564 --> 36:03.133
God, we were just
shopping for them, weren't we?

36:03.135 --> 36:05.034
We just...
we bought 'em the wigs

36:05.036 --> 36:07.504
and-and the cell phone, and...

36:07.506 --> 36:09.272
What?

36:09.274 --> 36:12.575
Where are they?

36:12.577 --> 36:13.910
Where's what?

36:13.912 --> 36:16.079
The stuff that we bought 'em.

36:16.081 --> 36:18.748
The wigs and...
and the carry-on?

36:18.750 --> 36:21.017
Do you see it
anywhere?

36:21.019 --> 36:22.619
No.

36:22.621 --> 36:25.121
Well, start looking.

36:25.123 --> 36:27.190
Cat would...

36:27.192 --> 36:28.606
didn't have a chance
to get rid of them, and...

36:28.630 --> 36:29.159
Heather.

36:29.161 --> 36:31.761
...and-and she wouldn't have
taken them with her, unless...

36:31.763 --> 36:32.929
Unless what?

36:35.500 --> 36:37.000
It's not here.

36:37.002 --> 36:38.668
None of it is here.

36:39.971 --> 36:41.504
Do you understand
what this means?

36:41.506 --> 36:43.039
No.
They took it with them

36:43.041 --> 36:44.641
because they needed it.

36:44.643 --> 36:46.876
Kyle, they're alive.

36:46.878 --> 36:48.444
They're...

36:48.446 --> 36:50.113
Oh, my God, they're alive!

36:50.115 --> 36:52.048
(shrieks)
What?

36:52.050 --> 36:53.449
(giggles)

37:08.995 --> 37:09.936

37:09.960 --> 37:13.811

VINCENT:
Bonjour, mademoiselle.

37:44.397 --> 37:45.500
V... Adam.

38:01.981 --> 38:04.949
Merci.

38:04.951 --> 38:06.651
Okay.

38:16.663 --> 38:19.263
(bell tolling)

38:22.268 --> 38:23.945
CATHERINE:
I thought you forgot.

38:23.955 --> 38:26.990
Come on. Our first wedding
anniversary? No way.

38:26.992 --> 38:29.425
Well, considering everything
that has happened to us

38:29.427 --> 38:31.427
since our wedding,
I would understand.

38:31.429 --> 38:34.497
Well, doesn't matter now, right?
This is what it's all about.

38:36.201 --> 38:38.334
CATHERINE: I can't believe
we got away with it.

38:38.336 --> 38:41.270
Blurring me out of that limo
into the river before it blew.

38:41.272 --> 38:43.339
Yeah, well, I told you
to trust me, didn't I?

38:43.341 --> 38:45.341
Mm. My hero.

38:45.343 --> 38:47.076
(both chuckle)

38:47.078 --> 38:48.444
So, where are we going?

38:48.446 --> 38:50.480
Come on, I told you.
It's a surprise.

38:50.482 --> 38:52.382
Oh. I have a surprise
for you, too.

38:52.384 --> 38:53.683
What?

38:53.685 --> 38:56.119
I passed the French bar.
I'm an <i>avocat.</i>

38:56.121 --> 38:57.553
You are?
Yes.

38:57.555 --> 39:00.657
That's amazing!
Congratulations! Mwah.

39:01.660 --> 39:04.627
I can't believe this is real.
What?

39:04.629 --> 39:08.564
Six months ago, we were dead,
and now we're here.

39:08.566 --> 39:11.634
Well, this is where
we belong, right?

39:11.636 --> 39:13.636
The City of Love.

39:13.638 --> 39:15.638
Absolutely.

39:15.640 --> 39:17.240
It's just...

39:17.242 --> 39:19.275
You miss 'em, don't you?

39:19.277 --> 39:20.677
Don't you?

39:20.679 --> 39:22.478
Absolutely.

39:29.487 --> 39:30.787
(indistinct chatter)

39:30.789 --> 39:33.656
Okay, so what's
the big surprise?

39:34.659 --> 39:37.226
They are.

39:37.228 --> 39:41.230
Eh! Bonjour!

39:41.232 --> 39:42.432
Are you kidding me?

39:42.434 --> 39:43.633
Happy anniversary.

39:43.635 --> 39:47.303
Hi, sister!
Buddy!

39:47.305 --> 39:48.604
(grunting)

39:48.606 --> 39:50.773
Oh, my God, get a room.

39:50.775 --> 39:52.508
(chuckling)
Come here, you.

39:52.510 --> 39:54.711
Mwah. Good to see you.

39:54.713 --> 39:56.079
Look at you!

39:56.081 --> 39:58.915
(overlapping chatter)

39:58.917 --> 40:01.184
Beautiful. You're like a big woman now.
Now that we're all together,

40:01.186 --> 40:02.985
let's eat, drink,
and be merry.

40:02.987 --> 40:04.687
You want a drink?
(clicks tongue) Yes.

40:04.689 --> 40:05.955
VINCENT:
A votre santé.

40:05.957 --> 40:07.290
ALL:
Santé!

40:07.292 --> 40:08.591
(chuckles)

40:08.593 --> 40:11.994
I can't believe you guys
are actually here.

40:11.996 --> 40:14.363
I know.
Guys, you should've heard

40:14.365 --> 40:16.899
JT's eulogy. It was beautiful.

40:16.901 --> 40:19.355
A little schmaltzy
but it's okay.

40:19.356 --> 40:19.997
Come on...

40:20.020 --> 40:22.338
Give me a break.
I thought they were really dead,

40:22.440 --> 40:24.388
remember?
JT, not so loud.

40:24.389 --> 40:25.393
What? I did.

40:25.417 --> 40:28.183
I know, but everyone else needs
to still think that they are.

40:28.580 --> 40:30.713
Nobody's looking for them.
Otherwise we wouldn't be here,

40:30.715 --> 40:31.848
right?
Okay,

40:31.850 --> 40:33.249
how's Kyle?

40:33.251 --> 40:33.883
Kyle's good.

40:33.885 --> 40:35.585
Oh.
Yeah.

40:35.587 --> 40:37.286
We're, you know...

40:37.288 --> 40:38.354
Living in sin.

40:38.356 --> 40:39.589
Tess!
What?

40:39.591 --> 40:40.490
You are.

40:40.492 --> 40:42.692
Wait, in-in our bed?

40:42.694 --> 40:45.027
Ugh, that's just wrong.
Okay, whatever.

40:45.029 --> 40:46.429
It's okay for you guys
but not for us?

40:46.431 --> 40:48.664
Uh, okay.
Wait-wait a minute. What?

40:48.666 --> 40:50.433
You guys
are living together now?

40:50.435 --> 40:51.934
Yes, they are.

40:52.403 --> 40:53.536
Oh.
Yeah.

40:53.538 --> 40:56.139
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

To love.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.114
To love. I will drink to that.
