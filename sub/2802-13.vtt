00:11.220 --> 00:13.305
How goes the construction
of our treasure map?

00:13.388 --> 00:14.890
The antenna?

00:14.973 --> 00:16.225
Slow and steady.

00:16.308 --> 00:17.392
I'm trying to build everything

00:17.476 --> 00:20.395
as close to the original
1940s designs as possible.

00:20.479 --> 00:23.815
Do you know how hard it is
to find vacuum tubes these days?

00:23.899 --> 00:25.484
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.027
Good work, Mozz.

00:27.110 --> 00:28.987
Oh, I don't like that expression.

00:29.071 --> 00:31.865
-Good work?
-Well, "work" implies I have a job.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.408
Apologies.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.702
A careless word may kindle strife.

00:36.286 --> 00:37.287
See you later.

00:38.997 --> 00:40.040
June?

00:45.212 --> 00:46.964
Oh, you must be Neal.

00:49.550 --> 00:51.844
You know my name, but I don't know yours.

00:51.927 --> 00:54.137
Ah, I see that you have met Ford.

00:54.221 --> 00:55.764
Hi. It's a pleasure.

00:56.640 --> 01:00.060
Ford is an old friend
and he's just moved back to Manhattan.

01:00.143 --> 01:02.688
FORD: I miss the old neighborhood,
to say the least.

01:02.771 --> 01:06.441
I think you'll find that you two
have quite a bit in common.

01:06.567 --> 01:07.568
Is that so?

01:07.651 --> 01:09.152
So you'll be around for a while?

01:09.236 --> 01:13.615
June has been kind enough to make
a few donations to my new apartment.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.576
We both know how generous she is.

01:16.118 --> 01:17.119
Thank you.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.162
That looks like one of Byron's suits.

01:19.246 --> 01:22.541
That reminds me. Um, I have
some more jackets in the backroom.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.334
-Come.
-Oh.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.089
How did you know June's husband?

01:29.965 --> 01:31.675
Byron and I worked together.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.136
Mmm. Partners in crime?

01:35.012 --> 01:36.430
Something like that.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.985
-Hey, is Peter around?
-Nope.

01:50.068 --> 01:51.069
I need a favor.

01:51.153 --> 01:53.655
Neal, what did I say last time
you asked me for a favor?

01:54.656 --> 01:57.534
I should think long and hard before
trying to pull anything over on you.

01:57.618 --> 01:59.494
-And?
-And that if I ever did try,

01:59.578 --> 02:01.413
you'd break one or both of my arms.

02:01.496 --> 02:02.915
You know I hate to repeat myself.

02:02.998 --> 02:03.999
I'm willing to risk it.

02:04.082 --> 02:05.417
Can you run a print?

02:06.335 --> 02:08.170
It's not for me. It's for June.

02:08.253 --> 02:10.464
Your landlady needs a print analysis?

02:10.547 --> 02:13.217
A friend of hers dropped by the house.
I think he's up to something.

02:13.300 --> 02:15.719
-You catch a name?
-Ford. It's probably a nickname.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.054
What did this Ford do?

02:17.137 --> 02:19.097
-He took some of June's things.
-Does she know?

02:20.015 --> 02:22.226
Actually, she gave them to him.

02:22.309 --> 02:23.769
Out of the kindness of her heart?

02:23.852 --> 02:25.437
-Yeah.
-But he may be a criminal?

02:26.522 --> 02:28.649
-Sound like anyone we know?
-This is different.

02:28.732 --> 02:30.651
Afraid you'll lose
that nice roof of yours?

02:30.734 --> 02:32.319
There's something off about this guy.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.613
Will you run it for me? Please?

02:38.951 --> 02:40.786
You know he doesn't like the vet.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.538
I think he feels guilty.

02:43.622 --> 02:45.332
-Huh.
-You wouldn't have been there

02:45.415 --> 02:46.625
if you didn't swallow
one of my handcuff keys.

02:46.708 --> 02:49.628
Honey, he's a dog. Dogs like shiny things.

02:49.711 --> 02:51.964
You need to be more careful
what you leave around.

02:52.047 --> 02:53.257
Oh, so I should feel guilty?

02:53.340 --> 02:55.717
-I think an apology's in order.

03:08.063 --> 03:09.314
Thank you.

03:09.398 --> 03:11.275
All right, come on. We got some time.
You wanna have lunch?

All right.

03:37.217 --> 03:38.218
Everything okay?

03:38.302 --> 03:41.597
It was until you told Diana
to red flag a murder suspect.

03:41.972 --> 03:43.098
Murder suspect?

03:43.182 --> 03:44.766
Jonas Ganz.

03:44.850 --> 03:48.020
Person of interest
in the Sturtevant heist a few years back.

03:48.103 --> 03:50.105
Charged with armed robbery and homicide.

03:50.189 --> 03:53.775
The only thing the prosecution could stick
was GTA for the getaway vehicle.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.652
June knows him?

03:55.736 --> 03:57.029
Yeah, she said he was a friend.

03:57.112 --> 04:00.324
Yeah, well, this friend has been
in and out of correctional facilities

04:00.407 --> 04:01.742
for the last decade or so.

04:02.451 --> 04:04.119
He had a lifer quality about him.

04:05.287 --> 04:10.334
Said his first stint was for burglary
in Lompoc back in 2000.

04:11.335 --> 04:12.336
Can I see that?

04:12.419 --> 04:13.420
Yeah.

04:16.840 --> 04:18.383
I think Diana pulled the wrong print.

04:18.467 --> 04:21.845
There was only one print on the coin.
And she ran it. Why?

04:21.929 --> 04:23.972
Because this isn't the guy I met.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.728
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:41.490 --> 04:45.327
The lab pulled seven points of reference
from the print on that coin.

04:45.410 --> 04:46.620
It belongs to Ganz.

04:46.703 --> 04:47.955
Well, this can't be identity theft.

04:48.038 --> 04:51.375
No, I don't think anybody would
wanna pass themself off as this guy.

04:51.458 --> 04:54.586
Peter, I dug up the intel
you requested on Ganz.

04:54.670 --> 04:56.922
I may have found our connection
to the guy you met at June's.

04:57.005 --> 04:58.048
That's him.

04:58.131 --> 04:59.842
PETER: Looks like Ganz
has a former cellmate.

04:59.925 --> 05:02.010
Bradford Tillman, AKA Ford.

05:02.094 --> 05:04.346
Locked up for real estate fraud
two years ago.

05:04.429 --> 05:07.057
Sold non-existent land
to a half a dozen major corporations.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.892
Another smooth talker.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.478
If he shared a cell with Ganz,
it could explain the print.

05:11.562 --> 05:13.689
But not why Ford doesn't have one.

05:13.772 --> 05:15.065
I saw him touch the coin.

05:15.148 --> 05:16.942
Superglue on the fingertips?
Invisible tape?

05:17.025 --> 05:19.278
No, I shook his hand. I would've noticed.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.029

05:21.113 --> 05:23.657
he's a known associate
of June's late husband.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.327
They were booked 20 years ago
for running a rooftop casino.

05:27.619 --> 05:29.872
Oh, out of your place. Look at that.

05:29.955 --> 05:30.998
NEAL: Always did feel like home.

05:31.081 --> 05:34.042
All right, Jones,
get ahold of Ganz's probation officer.

05:34.126 --> 05:35.252
Find out where he's staying.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.045
-Have Diana sit on him.
-On it.

05:38.463 --> 05:42.134
If Ganz and Ford are working our backyard,
I want to know about it.

Hey, June.

I knew you wouldn't mind.
I was looking for this.

06:04.281 --> 06:05.324
Photo album?

06:05.407 --> 06:07.492
Ford asked if he could see it.

06:12.664 --> 06:13.665
Oh.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.127
You two go way back.

Back then,
the three of us were inseparable.

-Lenox Lounge.
-Yes.

06:22.966 --> 06:25.219
Byron looked so handsome in that suit.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.305
Even Ford asked if I still have it.

06:28.388 --> 06:31.892
But I told him
it probably wouldn't fit him.

06:34.186 --> 06:35.729
It really is something.

06:35.812 --> 06:37.105
Yeah.

06:37.189 --> 06:39.441
I think I'll take it down, let him see it.

-Oh.

07:45.424 --> 07:47.759
Well, you know, Neal,
the reason why I came

07:47.843 --> 07:50.387
is because I wanna
set the record straight.

07:50.470 --> 07:51.763
You know how it is.

07:51.847 --> 07:54.099
You tell people that you've done time,

07:54.183 --> 07:56.268
and they have a bad way of looking at you.

07:57.186 --> 07:59.396
June told me a little.

07:59.479 --> 08:03.609
But given your current situation,
I was hoping that you'd understand.

08:04.610 --> 08:05.777
Maybe I do.

08:09.781 --> 08:13.785
You know, me and Byron,
this was our place.

08:13.869 --> 08:17.706
We had three games of five-card stud
going around the clock.

08:17.789 --> 08:18.790
Good rake?

08:18.874 --> 08:20.751
Well, we made a lot of green.

08:20.834 --> 08:24.505
Especially since the joint
was nicely juiced.

08:24.588 --> 08:26.757
What, did you have a mechanic?

08:26.840 --> 08:28.509
Kid, I was the mechanic.

08:29.468 --> 08:31.595
Running up cards in your own joint,
that's risky.

-Hmm.

about the good old days.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.204
I'm with you, but all we can assume

09:39.288 --> 09:41.123
is he's been in touch
with a former cellmate.

09:41.206 --> 09:42.541
Who's a potential killer.

09:42.624 --> 09:45.669
That's not very comforting, <i>mon frÃ¨re.</i>

09:45.752 --> 09:47.212
Think this is what Ford's after?

09:47.296 --> 09:49.798
Maybe Ford's trying to finish something
he and Byron started.

09:49.882 --> 09:52.509
Mmm. I can try and make it more legible.

09:52.593 --> 09:54.636

Yeah. I wanna talk to Ford.

10:14.531 --> 10:15.782
Bring him in the office tomorrow.

Neal tells me
that you pull team gags together.

-We do.
-He's a hell of an outside patsy.

12:07.269 --> 12:08.395
Yeah.

12:09.771 --> 12:11.481
He's got that look.

Did you bring ice cream from your truck?

17:13.575 --> 17:15.118
How did Ford know about the plate?

17:15.202 --> 17:16.537
He's probably known for years.

MOZZIE: I'm curious.
The plate in question?

17:21.250 --> 17:23.585
-Smart.
-Yeah, unlike newer banknotes

17:23.669 --> 17:25.003
they'd have fewer security features.

17:25.087 --> 17:27.297
No watermarking your Franklin.
No microprinting.

17:27.381 --> 17:29.466
No optically variable ink,
much easier to duplicate,

17:29.550 --> 17:30.717

17:30.801 --> 17:32.052
What's old becomes new again.

All right, since we can't find Ford,

let's figure out what else he needs
to make these bills.

some reading materials.

I've got the <i>Men in Black</i>

17:53.115 --> 17:55.617
These Treasury agents

17:55.701 --> 17:57.202
You look like a 12-year-old

17:57.286 --> 17:59.997
who just found the lingerie section
of a Sears catalog.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.833
Okay. The plate is the real deal,
but it's just a start.

18:02.916 --> 18:04.710
You need the right press, right cutter.

18:04.793 --> 18:06.962
But most importantly,
the right inks and paper.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.130
Can you forge these?

18:08.839 --> 18:12.467
US bills are tricky.
The ink maybe. But the paper?

18:12.551 --> 18:15.220
I mean, the feel of that linen cut
and blend is tough to duplicate.

18:15.804 --> 18:16.805
So I've been told.

18:17.848 --> 18:19.349
All right, we're done here.

18:22.394 --> 18:23.520
Neal.

18:27.774 --> 18:30.235
So could someone steal these things?

18:30.319 --> 18:32.112
You think that's why
Ganz pulled his crew together?

18:32.196 --> 18:33.906
Makes the most sense.

18:33.989 --> 18:36.325
Hey, we were sitting on Ganz's place.
Guess who showed up?

18:36.408 --> 18:38.869
We grabbed him as he left. No one saw.

18:44.458 --> 18:46.502
DIANA: Put him in the conference room.

18:46.585 --> 18:50.756
(CHUCKLES) You two
really do work together.

18:50.839 --> 18:52.674
Never lied about that.

18:52.758 --> 18:54.760
Tell me about your relationship with Ganz.

18:54.843 --> 18:57.429
I told him about the plate
while we were at Rikers.

18:57.513 --> 19:00.182
You traded information
with Ganz for protection.

19:00.265 --> 19:01.517
Where did you get the plate?

19:01.600 --> 19:03.936
Byron. He stole it.

19:04.019 --> 19:05.938
-From where?
-From me.

19:06.021 --> 19:07.898
I thought he would want in.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.983
It would have been a big one for us.

19:10.067 --> 19:13.070
Our, um, final score.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.241
But he wanted to print the money himself?

19:17.324 --> 19:19.034
He didn't wanna print it at all.

19:21.411 --> 19:23.080
He was protecting meâ€¦

19:24.206 --> 19:26.500
from myself.

19:26.583 --> 19:29.419
So coming back into June's life,

19:29.503 --> 19:31.713
everything you said to her,
it's all a lie?

19:31.797 --> 19:33.298
No.

19:33.382 --> 19:36.343
If Ganz had found
that plate in her houseâ€¦

19:37.678 --> 19:39.137
I came backâ€¦

19:40.264 --> 19:41.682
to protect her.

19:42.891 --> 19:45.811
PETER: Right. Ganz has the plate.
What's his next move?

19:45.894 --> 19:47.646
I told him what else he needed.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.691
-Paper, inkâ€¦
-Cutter, press.

19:50.774 --> 19:52.401
The list was long.

19:57.739 --> 19:59.867
Now, from one professional to another,

20:01.076 --> 20:02.494
how come you don't have any prints?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.329
Pumice stone.

20:04.413 --> 20:07.165
I rub my fingers with it every morning.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.210
Wake up, brush your teeth,

20:10.294 --> 20:12.880
scrape incriminating evidence
off your fingertips?

20:14.840 --> 20:16.383
Old habits.

20:19.887 --> 20:21.054
Yeah.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.856
-You think he's telling the truth?
-Maybe.

20:32.107 --> 20:34.651
-Ford wears a hat.
-And?

20:36.028 --> 20:38.447
-I'm not him, Peter.
-I didn't say anything.

20:38.530 --> 20:40.282
-Just commenting on the hat.
-Mmm-hmm.

20:40.365 --> 20:42.159
You think he wanted to protect June?

20:42.242 --> 20:44.286
-You don't.
-No, I think he's looking

20:44.369 --> 20:46.038
for that last big score.

20:47.873 --> 20:49.291
People can change, Peter.

20:49.708 --> 20:50.709
Maybe.

20:51.835 --> 20:54.963
Look, the fastest way to shut this down

20:55.047 --> 20:59.051
is to get Ganz and his crew confessing
to a premeditated crime on tape.

20:59.134 --> 21:00.677
You wanna send Ford undercover?

21:00.761 --> 21:02.387
-It's a big risk.
-Not just Ford.

21:03.639 --> 21:04.973
-Me?
-Yeah.

21:05.057 --> 21:09.478
Look, Ganz has two wheelmen,
two pieces of muscle and a forger.

21:09.561 --> 21:12.022
We'll need to take one of them
out of the equation.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.608
Can I make a suggestion?

21:21.198 --> 21:23.450
Took Ganz's forger out of play.

21:23.534 --> 21:25.953
He had a nice little side hobby going.

21:26.036 --> 21:28.872
Forged autographed Yankee baseballs.

21:28.956 --> 21:32.042

21:32.125 --> 21:33.710

21:33.794 --> 21:35.921
-I did. That was good.
-I'm ready, fellas.

holding a Renoir.

21:52.437 --> 21:54.231
-That was you?
-That was me.

21:57.442 --> 21:58.777
This ain't nothing.

22:16.712 --> 22:17.713
GANZ: Is that the guy?

22:17.796 --> 22:19.089
Who else would it be?

22:22.885 --> 22:25.137
This kid is the best print man around.

22:25.220 --> 22:26.597
GANZ: Does this kid have a name?

22:27.139 --> 22:30.184
No names. Less we know
about each other, the better.

22:31.727 --> 22:33.312
How long have you guys known each other?

22:34.479 --> 22:35.647
About five years.

22:35.731 --> 22:38.275
A mutual friend of ours needed to get
out of town so he came to my shop.

22:38.358 --> 22:40.652
He hooked me up
with some of the best work I've ever seen.

22:40.736 --> 22:42.154
Photo ID, passports.

22:42.237 --> 22:43.447
FORD: So we stayed in touch.

22:43.530 --> 22:45.240
Used him four times since.

22:45.324 --> 22:46.700
Five. Don't forget that other thing.

22:46.783 --> 22:48.243
-Well, that was between us.
-NEAL: All right.

22:49.411 --> 22:50.829
Let's see what he knows.

22:50.913 --> 22:52.998
It's like they're speaking criminese.

22:53.081 --> 22:54.499

They're all fake.

And last time I checked,
Illinois is spelled with two L's, not one.

23:35.541 --> 23:36.667
All right.

23:37.543 --> 23:38.544
I'm sold.

23:40.212 --> 23:41.630
I'll need to know the required tools.

23:41.713 --> 23:43.549
We have the equipment already.

23:43.632 --> 23:45.259
And we have the list.

23:45.342 --> 23:47.052
I'll contact you this week.

23:47.135 --> 23:49.555
I gave you the list,
but now I'm bringing you help, good help.

23:49.638 --> 23:52.808

get busted for a phony baseball.

23:58.772 --> 24:00.148
How did you know it was a baseball?

24:01.817 --> 24:02.985

24:04.111 --> 24:05.988

24:09.992 --> 24:11.076

24:12.202 --> 24:13.996
I think you know a little too much.

24:23.088 --> 24:24.798

24:24.882 --> 24:26.925

I'll give you one.

GANZ: Maybe. I don't know you.

24:32.306 --> 24:34.057
And Ford has a tendency to get chatty.

24:34.141 --> 24:35.350
-Put it past him.
-Why should I?

24:35.434 --> 24:37.186
-Because I called the feds.
-Youâ€¦

24:37.269 --> 24:40.689
Yeah. I let word slip
about a few indecent eBay transactions.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.149
There better be a good reason.

24:42.232 --> 24:43.942
Ford told me
you were pulling something big.

24:44.026 --> 24:46.153
And that you'd need a reliable bill maker.

24:46.236 --> 24:49.531
And I wasn't about to risk my share
on some halfwit hire.

24:49.615 --> 24:50.741

hold onto this for a while.

wouldn't be breathing right now.

If Ganz contacts you,
I want you ready, willing and able.

25:54.471 --> 25:58.100
Now, he said he already had the tools.
What else does he need?

25:58.183 --> 26:01.270
Well, I saw Ford's checklist.
It's either ink, paper or both.

26:01.353 --> 26:05.232
Ah. You and Ford
had a pretty interesting rapport today.

26:05.315 --> 26:08.026
-I know where you're going.
-Don't need a crystal ball?

26:08.110 --> 26:09.444
You think he's a cautionary tale.

26:09.528 --> 26:11.113
You wanna be like him when you grow up?

26:11.196 --> 26:12.447
More fun than sitting in a cubicle.

26:12.531 --> 26:17.327
Neal, if ever you do decide to grow up,
you should realize this one thing:

26:17.411 --> 26:19.246
You can either be a con or a man.

26:19.955 --> 26:21.164
You can't be both.

26:24.418 --> 26:27.963
Ran accounts on everyone in Ganz's crew.
They're pretty dried up.

26:28.046 --> 26:30.632
Probably paying for supplies in cash.

26:32.217 --> 26:35.387
Be good if you could remember the aliases
you saw on those IDs.

Kenny Estrada and Dillon Fleakes.

-We printed him this morning.
-There are two colors of ink here.

27:16.261 --> 27:19.848
He had dark green ink on his fingers
before we brought him in.

-Yeah.

-Hey.
-Oh, hey.

27:33.654 --> 27:34.947

-What?

27:39.117 --> 27:40.494
Nothing. What'd you find?

27:40.577 --> 27:43.080
He's been staying at the Continental
in Long Island City.

27:43.163 --> 27:44.373
Paid for his room with cash,

27:44.456 --> 27:47.251
but we got a pay-per-view charge
off the card he laid down for deposit.

-He's working with us.

-He was a true legend.
-Hmm.

28:26.331 --> 28:27.499
Byron had it better.

28:27.583 --> 28:29.334
He wound up with the plate.

-June?
-Yeah, and a home.

You think Byron wanted out of the life?

28:36.884 --> 28:38.468
I think he did.

28:38.552 --> 28:40.804
That's why he hid the plate
instead of using it.

28:40.888 --> 28:43.765
Well, if he really wanted out,
he could've destroyed the plate.

of that last big score is strong.

37:50.896 --> 37:52.397
I'm sorry.

38:07.079 --> 38:08.664
Stand down. Come on.

38:11.542 --> 38:13.252
-Ford?
-He went that way.

38:13.335 --> 38:15.462
But this place was a speakeasy.
There are exits everywhere.

38:15.546 --> 38:19.591
Suspect is exiting
the southeast corner of the building.

38:19.675 --> 38:21.051
He won't get far.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.137
Ganz is out front.

38:24.221 --> 38:26.932
Jones and Diana are picking up
the rest of his crew.

38:28.559 --> 38:29.893
(SIGHS)

38:30.936 --> 38:32.187
I tried to help him.

38:35.315 --> 38:36.984
You know, (CLEARS THROAT)

38:38.694 --> 38:42.990
there's one thing Byron figured out
that Ford never did.

38:47.035 --> 38:49.454
<i>There's no such thing as a final score.</i>

38:53.208 --> 38:54.751
<i>Only the next one.</i>

38:57.963 --> 38:59.298
(SIGHS)

39:02.718 --> 39:06.096
Unless you figure that out,
you're gonna lose in the end.

39:10.601 --> 39:11.602
(SIGHS)

39:13.812 --> 39:14.980
You ready?

39:16.982 --> 39:18.066
Yeah.

39:26.074 --> 39:28.702
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING ON RECORD PLAYER)

39:39.421 --> 39:40.589
June.

39:43.300 --> 39:44.593
(SIGHS)

39:46.929 --> 39:48.263
It's okay.

39:50.807 --> 39:53.769
I've always known what kind of man he was.

39:56.480 --> 39:57.981
Then why let him in?

39:59.691 --> 40:01.109
To rememberâ€¦

40:03.737 --> 40:05.864
what Byron and I had.

40:09.034 --> 40:10.869
Even if it was just for a while.

40:16.542 --> 40:18.919
Maybe I wanted to go dancing again.

40:36.019 --> 40:37.187
May I?

40:56.498 --> 40:59.710
I found a junk guy in Queens
who collects vintage radios.

40:59.793 --> 41:01.545
It's a goldmine for parts.

41:01.628 --> 41:03.714
I should have a working prototypeâ€¦

41:05.215 --> 41:06.633
Neal, are you listening?

41:10.179 --> 41:13.265
Do you ever think about
how all this is gonna end?

41:13.348 --> 41:16.560
Oh, you mean the big score
or the big house?

41:16.643 --> 41:19.021
-Yeah.
-Is there another option?

41:19.104 --> 41:20.689
Byron found it.

41:21.106 --> 41:23.192
Ah. The true-love route.

41:23.275 --> 41:25.569
You know,
that's the biggest con of them all.

41:26.737 --> 41:28.197
You're a cynic.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.448
Of course.

41:30.991 --> 41:32.784
You know what they say.

41:32.868 --> 41:34.745
Old con men never die.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.705
Our smiles just fade away.

41:45.380 --> 41:47.216
So you got rid of the printing plate?

41:47.299 --> 41:50.010
NEAL: It may have found its way
back inside the table.

41:50.093 --> 41:52.179
-MOZZIE: For a rainy day?
-Yeah.

41:53.222 --> 41:54.598
NEAL: For a rainy day.
