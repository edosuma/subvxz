T-Tan-Tandy.

00:30.406 --> 00:31.805
Tandy.

00:31.841 --> 00:34.508
What? What?

00:34.577 --> 00:36.710
What? You okay?

00:36.745 --> 00:39.813
We got company.

00:53.851 --> 00:56.751
Synced and corrected by Octavia
- www.addic7ed.com -

00:59.635 --> 01:02.069
- A sleep birth?
- Yep.

01:02.104 --> 01:04.134
Had her right in my sleep.

01:04.159 --> 01:06.240
That is the weirdest
thing I've ever heard.

01:06.308 --> 01:08.508
Well, I've had similar
nocturnal movements.

01:08.577 --> 01:10.544
Eh, not a baby of course, but, uh,

01:10.579 --> 01:12.446
I was, uh, surprised in the morning.

01:12.481 --> 01:14.897
I mean, I was so worried about it.

01:14.922 --> 01:19.086
'Cause, Erica, your
birth seemed very painful.

01:19.121 --> 01:21.201
Am I wrong about that?

01:21.226 --> 01:23.390
Yeah, the pain was significant.

01:23.415 --> 01:26.426
Yeah, 'cause for me, it
was the exact opposite.

01:26.462 --> 01:28.128
Like, nothing.

01:28.197 --> 01:30.697
In fact, I have a sneaking suspicion,

01:30.733 --> 01:33.367
I might have even orgasmed.

01:33.402 --> 01:34.199
Oh.

01:34.224 --> 01:36.761
- Well, good for you.
- Yeah, right?

01:36.786 --> 01:38.907
Anyway, looking back at it now,

01:38.932 --> 01:42.837
I realize all that
worrying was for nothing.

01:43.303 --> 01:44.903
Isn't that right, Bezequille?

01:45.743 --> 01:48.012
So, we're sticking with Bezequille?

01:50.485 --> 01:52.911
I l... I love it.

01:52.946 --> 01:56.615
- Yeah.
- Hey there, Bezequille.

01:56.640 --> 01:58.850
I'm your Uncle Todd,

01:58.885 --> 02:01.586
and this is your Aunt Melissa.

02:01.621 --> 02:04.923
You want to say hi, Melissa?

02:05.577 --> 02:06.691
Hey.

02:07.761 --> 02:09.727
What's up?

02:09.763 --> 02:11.029
Look at you.

02:11.682 --> 02:13.081
You're perfect.

02:13.106 --> 02:15.066
You little bumblebee.

02:15.135 --> 02:18.403
That's what you are, a little bumblebee.

02:18.438 --> 02:21.873
'Cause you stung me...
right in the heart.

02:22.259 --> 02:26.044
It's swelling up bigger
than I ever thought possible.

02:26.516 --> 02:28.182
- Sorry.
- Well,

02:28.548 --> 02:30.480
I'm gonna go eat the placenta.

02:30.505 --> 02:32.096
Anybody want to join?

02:32.121 --> 02:33.214
- Thanks for asking.
- Oh, no.

02:33.239 --> 02:35.112
- I have some things I got to do.
- I'm practicing my accordion.

02:35.182 --> 02:37.121
I would love some.

02:41.628 --> 02:43.228
Oh, my God.

02:43.263 --> 02:44.963
I can't believe I stayed sober

02:44.998 --> 02:47.232
for two weeks waiting
to deliver that baby,

02:47.267 --> 02:49.734
and Carol goes and pops
it out in her sleep.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.769
Oh, was the birth easy for Carol?

02:51.805 --> 02:53.304
I hadn't heard that.

02:53.340 --> 02:55.874
Hey, look on the bright side,
I'm not on baby watch anymore.

02:55.909 --> 02:57.709
So, what do you say, we can finally have

02:57.777 --> 02:59.230
that little date night tonight?

02:59.255 --> 03:01.346
Ugh, that's exactly what I need.

03:01.381 --> 03:03.147
What are we gonna do with this one?

03:03.691 --> 03:06.746
I think I know someone
who might be available.

03:06.771 --> 03:08.786
A thousand times yes!

03:08.822 --> 03:10.555
Oh, this is gonna be so great.

03:10.590 --> 03:12.857
We're gonna read some
stories, sing some lullabies,

03:12.893 --> 03:14.692
maybe count macaronis together.

03:14.728 --> 03:17.061
Oh, gotta do some tickling.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.664
Okay, I'm off to get supplies.
Whenever you guys need me,

03:19.699 --> 03:22.133
I'll be waiting right outside your door.

03:26.806 --> 03:30.275
And then the noodle
realized that he needed

03:30.310 --> 03:34.045
to take a high dive off
his own expectations.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.347
That sounds like a great story.

03:36.383 --> 03:37.746
- Yeah.
- You know, Care Bear,

03:37.771 --> 03:40.084
I feel like I gave birth today, too.

03:40.120 --> 03:41.886
To a new worldview.

03:41.955 --> 03:43.721
A new responsibility.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.024
And a new song.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.459
I call this "A New World View,

03:48.495 --> 03:51.663
A New Responsibility, A New Song."

03:52.462 --> 03:55.003
Give her a front row seat.

03:55.300 --> 03:56.643

Care Bear. You okay?

04:45.585 --> 04:47.552
Yeah. I've...

04:47.587 --> 04:50.788
I've just had this weird
cramp all day, and now

04:50.824 --> 04:52.256
I just feel dizzy.

04:52.292 --> 04:55.059
Why don't we go check in
with Gail, just to be safe?

04:55.095 --> 04:57.161
- Okay? Here, I'll get the baby.
- Okay.

04:59.168 --> 05:01.131
You almost done?

05:01.935 --> 05:04.402
Just give me another sec.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.561
Huh.

05:14.381 --> 05:15.780
What?

05:16.483 --> 05:17.707
Carol...

05:18.465 --> 05:20.379
you ever go to a fast-food joint?

05:20.404 --> 05:23.087
Oh, I'm gonna stop you right
there... I don't like fast food.

05:23.112 --> 05:25.079
I prefer it slow or mid-tempo.

05:25.191 --> 05:27.191
I do like fast food.

05:27.603 --> 05:30.884
And I went to a place once,

05:31.157 --> 05:33.376
- and I ordered a cheeseburger,
- Mm.

05:33.688 --> 05:35.099
And after I ate it,

05:35.135 --> 05:37.769
I reached into the bag for a napkin,

05:37.804 --> 05:40.538
and I noticed...

05:40.815 --> 05:43.182
a second cheeseburger down there.

05:45.576 --> 05:47.076
You see what I mean?

05:48.948 --> 05:53.117
An additional cheeseburger
that I had not ordered?

05:53.186 --> 05:55.286
Um... I'm lost here.

05:55.321 --> 05:57.288
What are you saying?

05:57.323 --> 05:59.257
Carol...

05:59.292 --> 06:02.093
you've got another baby stuck up in ya.

06:05.737 --> 06:07.926
There's another baby inside of me.

06:07.951 --> 06:09.636
Is that even possible?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.628
Well, I'm looking at
it with my own two eyes,

06:12.764 --> 06:15.031
so... yeah, I'm gonna go with yes.

06:15.100 --> 06:17.200
Hello, ladies.

06:17.302 --> 06:19.669
Me and my daughter, just born today...

06:19.737 --> 06:22.175
You were there... Uh,
we're just checking in

06:22.200 --> 06:24.111
to see how you guys were doing.

06:24.576 --> 06:27.777
Tandy, I have something to tell you.

06:28.197 --> 06:30.030
Uh, what's up, Care Bear?

06:30.264 --> 06:32.381
We're gonna have another baby.

06:32.450 --> 06:34.417
Well, sounds good. Let
me just go wash my balls.

06:34.452 --> 06:35.485
Oh, no-no-no-no.

06:35.587 --> 06:38.588
I mean, we're gonna have
another baby right now.

06:38.656 --> 06:41.141
Carol, warning: they're pretty dirty.

06:41.166 --> 06:44.560
Tandy, I'm not talking
about making another baby.

06:44.629 --> 06:49.699
I'm saying there's another
baby already inside of me.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.825
You...

06:55.658 --> 06:58.541
You have another
cheeseburger in the bag?

06:58.610 --> 06:59.775
Yeah.

07:01.513 --> 07:03.546
I'm gonna be another father.

07:05.644 --> 07:08.645
Oh, my God. So, what's the ETA?

07:08.670 --> 07:09.886
Well, they usually come

07:09.954 --> 07:13.055
one right after the
other, but says here,

07:13.124 --> 07:17.059
it's not too uncommon for
there to be a little separation.

07:17.128 --> 07:20.221
Say what you will about
the cleanliness of my balls,

07:20.246 --> 07:22.965
but they sure know how to make babies.

07:23.101 --> 07:25.902
Yeah. I guess that's the takeaway.

07:25.970 --> 07:27.270
Gross.

07:27.338 --> 07:30.015
Bad news, hon.

07:30.040 --> 07:32.542
- Date night's off.
- Why?

07:32.610 --> 07:35.077
Carol's got another baby stuck up her.

07:35.102 --> 07:37.490
What? No way.

07:37.515 --> 07:39.215
Yup, right up in her.

07:39.615 --> 07:42.595
Am I horrible for being super
glad she's having another one?

07:42.620 --> 07:45.044
- Of course not.
- Or for the main reason

07:45.084 --> 07:48.201
being my sincere desire for
it to be incredibly painful?

07:48.226 --> 07:51.227
Now, that does tip it back the
other way, just a little bit.

07:51.329 --> 07:53.996
- Yeah, you can never tell her I said that.
- I won't.

07:54.021 --> 07:56.232
'Cause then she might downplay
the pain just to spite me.

07:56.257 --> 07:58.100
Can I be there? Can I watch?

07:58.371 --> 08:00.269
I'm not sure your current energy

08:00.305 --> 08:02.738
would be super helpful in that room.

08:02.763 --> 08:05.474
I'm sorry. Obviously, I want
her to have a smooth birth.

08:05.543 --> 08:06.742
Oh, yeah.

08:06.878 --> 08:10.290
But with just enough pain
to respect the process.

08:14.018 --> 08:16.419
You are barely dilated.

08:18.056 --> 08:22.025
So, nothing? You don't
feel any contractions?

08:22.050 --> 08:22.869
Nope.

08:22.894 --> 08:24.627
Here, Care Bear, try this.

08:25.448 --> 08:27.430
Aah! Aah! What is that?!

08:27.498 --> 08:29.098
It's a bowl of Tabasco sauce.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.600
I-I found a list of the things

08:30.702 --> 08:32.335
that are supposed to help induce labor,

08:32.437 --> 08:34.236
and spicy foods is one of them.

08:34.304 --> 08:36.105
I-I guess they steam the baby out?

08:36.174 --> 08:37.607
Here, Gail, check her now.

08:39.405 --> 08:40.703
No change.

08:40.850 --> 08:42.912
Hey, relax.

08:42.981 --> 08:44.785
I am not worried.

08:44.810 --> 08:46.649
The baby will come when it's ready.

08:46.718 --> 08:48.751
Well, look at you,

08:48.776 --> 08:52.033
- all mellowed out.
- Well, Bezequille taught me

08:52.058 --> 08:53.893
a big lesson today.

08:53.918 --> 08:55.992
All that time I spent
worried about her birth,

08:56.060 --> 08:57.672
I'll never get it back.

08:57.697 --> 08:59.600
So starting tonight,

08:59.625 --> 09:01.364
I am not gonna get all jangled up

09:01.432 --> 09:03.733
about things that are beyond my control.

09:03.801 --> 09:05.001
Good for you, hon.

09:05.794 --> 09:07.996
So, I'm gonna go to bed.

09:08.021 --> 09:09.105
Um...

09:09.173 --> 09:10.806
here's a misoprostol

09:10.875 --> 09:12.508
to get the ball rolling down there.

09:12.610 --> 09:15.411
And you just give me a
shout if anything happens.

09:15.732 --> 09:16.958
Thanks, Mom.

09:16.983 --> 09:20.182
This is great. Between
Gail's medicine and my list,

09:20.251 --> 09:22.018
we'll get this baby out of you.

09:22.086 --> 09:24.153
So you just sit back and... relax!

09:26.891 --> 09:28.190
Scaring you is on the list.

09:28.259 --> 09:29.792
Yeah. Anything?

09:29.817 --> 09:32.028
- No.
- Okay. Well...

09:32.096 --> 09:34.530
cross that one off.

09:35.028 --> 09:36.332
Or will I?

09:40.905 --> 09:42.571
What's with the sour mug, bub?

09:42.640 --> 09:45.207
Nothing. I'm fine.

09:47.291 --> 09:49.312
I thought you were
supposed to be babysitting.

09:49.380 --> 09:51.080
Erica called it off, 'cause Gail's busy

09:51.149 --> 09:52.315
with Carol's birth stuff.

09:52.383 --> 09:55.584
Well, it's probably for the best.

09:56.679 --> 09:58.020
What's that supposed to mean?

09:58.056 --> 10:01.223
I mean, I just know you have
a little case of baby fever,

10:01.292 --> 10:03.225
and I see where this is going.

10:04.896 --> 10:07.096
No, Melissa, look.

10:07.464 --> 10:09.464
We made our decision, okay?

10:09.489 --> 10:11.200
Having kids is not for us.

10:11.269 --> 10:14.337
And I totally respect your
desire to remain barren.

10:14.553 --> 10:16.320
Todd, be honest with me.

10:16.536 --> 10:18.808
Melissa, I don't need kids to be happy.

10:18.876 --> 10:20.543
All I need is you.

10:29.854 --> 10:31.721
You feeling anything?

10:32.697 --> 10:33.689
No.

10:34.094 --> 10:35.958
Hmm. Nipple stimulation's supposed to be

10:36.027 --> 10:37.460
one of the biggies. Here, let me

10:37.528 --> 10:39.929
try the other way a little bit.

10:43.196 --> 10:44.614
Still nothing?

10:46.003 --> 10:47.970
Let me try this.

10:52.232 --> 10:53.876
Anything?

10:53.945 --> 10:56.579
Flick 'em, flick 'em.

10:58.182 --> 10:59.415
Nothing?

11:01.401 --> 11:02.595
No.

11:02.620 --> 11:05.136
Oh, maybe they're talking
about intellectual stimulation.

11:05.769 --> 11:07.923
What if Benjamin Buttons had a zipper?

11:07.948 --> 11:09.625
Tandy, I appreciate your efforts,

11:09.694 --> 11:11.427
but I think I'm just too tired

11:11.496 --> 11:13.696
to be stimulated nipple-arily.

11:13.765 --> 11:15.965
Oh. Then, baby, why
don't you get some sleep?

11:16.033 --> 11:18.200
What kind of mother
would I be if I missed

11:18.269 --> 11:20.921
two of my babies being
born in the same day?

11:20.946 --> 11:23.572
Hey, Care Bear, would you feel better

11:23.608 --> 11:26.342
if I stayed up all night
and watched your vagina?

11:26.377 --> 11:28.077
You would do that for me?

11:28.146 --> 11:29.512
I would do that for a lot of people.

11:29.614 --> 11:32.047
But tonight, yes, it's for you.

11:32.116 --> 11:34.483
- I love you.
- I love you.

11:36.201 --> 11:39.889
Now, promise me you'll wake me
up the second anything happens.

11:39.957 --> 11:42.124
Carol, columns could crumble.

11:42.193 --> 11:43.659
The moon could explode.

11:43.694 --> 11:46.495
A banshee could scream
in the very face of time.

11:46.564 --> 11:48.736
And I will not... stop...

11:48.761 --> 11:51.734
watching... this... vagina.

11:53.569 --> 11:55.321
Clocking in.

12:04.002 --> 12:05.091
Tandy.

12:05.226 --> 12:06.926
- Oh, what...
- Tandy.

12:06.951 --> 12:08.184
Wha-Wha... What? What, what?

12:08.286 --> 12:10.910
You said you'd keep
watch for me all night.

12:10.935 --> 12:12.455
Carol, relax.

12:12.523 --> 12:13.989
I had it covered.

12:14.058 --> 12:16.992
What do you mean, had it covered?

12:20.064 --> 12:21.430
Still need me here, bud?

12:21.566 --> 12:23.499
Thanks. I-I got it from here, bud.

12:27.478 --> 12:28.711
Carol.

12:28.736 --> 12:30.002
Todd.

12:31.008 --> 12:32.939
- Gail.
- Todd.

12:33.681 --> 12:35.544
So, where we at?

12:35.861 --> 12:38.047
Still stuck at the equator, Mom.

12:38.115 --> 12:40.015
That pill should've worked by now.

12:40.084 --> 12:42.117
Okay, let me take another look.

12:43.888 --> 12:46.589
All these people looking at my pieces.

12:46.624 --> 12:50.092
Now I know what the Newport
Ceramics Festival feels like.

12:51.936 --> 12:53.796
Okay, well, um...

12:53.865 --> 12:56.332
Tandy, could I talk to you...

12:56.400 --> 12:58.234
for a second, outside?

12:58.302 --> 13:00.503
- Sure.
- No. I want to hear it.

13:00.571 --> 13:03.372
Whatever you have to say to
him, you can say to me, too.

13:04.546 --> 13:05.875
Fine. I...

13:05.943 --> 13:08.244
I'm kind of freaking out here.

13:08.312 --> 13:09.999
Why are you so worried?

13:10.024 --> 13:13.942
Because I don't want anything
to happen to you or this baby.

13:13.967 --> 13:15.551
Well, neither do I.

13:15.879 --> 13:17.920
But it's all gonna be okay.

13:17.989 --> 13:19.755
Yeah, it will.

13:19.824 --> 13:22.892
'Cause we're gonna get
that baby out of you.

13:23.225 --> 13:25.278
Right friggin' now.

13:26.097 --> 13:28.387
We... We need to get the baby out now?

13:28.474 --> 13:29.473
What's the rush?

13:29.542 --> 13:30.808
Thought your book said
it wasn't a big deal.

13:30.876 --> 13:33.477
Well, the longer you wait,
the more risk of complications.

13:33.546 --> 13:35.946
I mean, the baby's head could
get too big for the birth canal.

13:36.015 --> 13:38.616
Extra pressure on the umbilical cord.

13:38.684 --> 13:41.444
Possibility of meconium infection.

13:41.469 --> 13:43.673
Look, I appreciate your concern,

13:43.698 --> 13:45.598
but I've read about all the risks,

13:45.667 --> 13:47.600
and I'm not worried about it.

13:47.669 --> 13:50.103
Hon, we should hear Gail out, okay?

13:50.205 --> 13:51.804
So, uh, what are you proposing?

13:52.208 --> 13:54.340
I want to go in

13:54.409 --> 13:57.271
and break the amniotic
sac with a needle.

13:57.296 --> 14:01.083
D... Uh... no, we are
not kebabing our baby.

14:01.108 --> 14:02.649
Well, it's our best option.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.283
Well, if it's such a great option,

14:04.352 --> 14:05.812
why isn't it even on my list?

14:05.837 --> 14:07.352
- Oh...
- Please, please.

14:07.377 --> 14:11.257
It's hard for me to put
what I'm feeling into words.

14:11.326 --> 14:13.626
Call it mother's intuition.

14:13.695 --> 14:15.795
But I need you to trust me.

14:15.897 --> 14:18.231
The baby will come when it's ready.

14:20.236 --> 14:21.501
Okay.

14:21.569 --> 14:23.336
If that's what you want.

14:23.438 --> 14:24.671
It is.

14:28.376 --> 14:30.476
Who's a little angel?

14:30.545 --> 14:32.412
Are you my little baby pet?

14:32.480 --> 14:35.381
Did you keep Mommy up
all night last night?

14:35.450 --> 14:36.749
Was that you?

14:36.818 --> 14:38.384
Yes, it was.

14:38.453 --> 14:41.054
That was you, wasn't it? Yes, you did.

14:41.156 --> 14:42.889
Oh, hey.

14:42.957 --> 14:44.924
Hey, Todd. Hey.

14:44.993 --> 14:47.994
Hey, um, you feeling okay?

14:48.421 --> 14:49.495
Why?

14:49.564 --> 14:50.863
Just seem a little tired.

14:50.888 --> 14:53.032
You know, just based on
what your face looks like.

14:53.168 --> 14:56.569
- Wow.
- No, d-don't-don't get me wrong.

14:56.638 --> 14:59.505
Y... You-you look
great, hon. Very wise.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.775
You know, like an old,
gnarled oak tree, you know?

15:02.844 --> 15:04.343
Tons of integrity.

15:04.412 --> 15:06.112
- Thank you?
- You know,

15:06.147 --> 15:07.914
th-this isn't coming
out right. I just...

15:07.989 --> 15:11.196
If you need to take a little
nap, I'd be happy to watch Dawn.

15:11.221 --> 15:14.012
- Well, I'm not sure about
the tree stuff... - Fair.

15:14.089 --> 15:15.916
But I could really use a nap.

15:15.941 --> 15:19.025
A-And just so you know, I
don't need kids to be happy.

15:19.086 --> 15:21.916
- Oh, good for you, Todd.
- All I need is Melissa.

15:22.314 --> 15:23.529
- Todd...
- This is just so you can get some sleep

15:23.598 --> 15:25.127
- for your face.
- All right, I got it.

15:25.152 --> 15:27.319
- You've made that abundantly clear.
- Okay.

15:28.025 --> 15:28.935
Bye-bye, Dawn.

15:29.003 --> 15:30.416
Bye-bye.

15:31.611 --> 15:33.578
- Bye.
- See you.

15:35.677 --> 15:37.910
She's gone. Hey.

15:45.393 --> 15:46.496
Oh. Hey.

15:46.521 --> 15:48.020
Hey, Melissa.

15:48.089 --> 15:49.622
Where have you been?

15:50.357 --> 15:53.092
You know, just, um...

15:53.205 --> 15:55.038
hanging out with the guys.

15:55.063 --> 15:57.130
Is that baby powder on your shirt?

15:57.198 --> 15:59.098
This is, um, um...

15:59.373 --> 16:01.100
the, um...

16:01.169 --> 16:03.302
It's... cocaine.

16:03.371 --> 16:04.784
Cocaine?

16:04.809 --> 16:06.609
Yes. Cocaine.

16:06.634 --> 16:09.976
I was doing cocaine
because... I love it.

16:10.044 --> 16:11.144
You were with Dawn, weren't you?

16:11.212 --> 16:13.146
Look, how many times
do I have to tell you?

16:13.214 --> 16:16.493
I was snorting and smoking
cocaine all day, okay?

16:16.518 --> 16:18.851
And then, when I was putting
my mirror and coke toot away,

16:18.953 --> 16:20.141
I must've gotten some on my shirt,

16:20.166 --> 16:22.922
and then I showed up here,
you started reaming me out.

16:22.991 --> 16:25.458
- Todd, come on.
- Look, can this wait till morning?

16:25.527 --> 16:28.761
Okay, great. Good night.

16:29.131 --> 16:30.496
Mm, okay.

16:30.521 --> 16:32.532
Good night, Scarface.

16:34.002 --> 16:36.803
And then the witch
ate her mother's heart

16:36.871 --> 16:39.772
and understood the
language of all birds.

16:39.841 --> 16:41.053
- She...
- Look at her,

16:41.101 --> 16:42.285
putting on such a brave face.

16:42.310 --> 16:44.205
She's obviously petrified.

16:44.230 --> 16:46.746
Denial isn't just a river in Phoenix.

16:46.848 --> 16:49.749
It's also a very real
psychological state, Gail.

16:51.486 --> 16:53.204
I can't just stand here and watch this.

16:53.229 --> 16:55.354
- Wait. No, no. Gail.
- All right, Carol,

16:55.490 --> 16:57.751
enough is enough. We're
gonna break that water.

16:57.776 --> 16:59.360
- I won't take no for an answer.
- Oh.

16:59.385 --> 17:01.891
So I guess you're making all
the decisions now, huh, Gail?

17:01.916 --> 17:04.174
Well, since I am the
only adult in the room,

17:04.199 --> 17:06.365
- I do consider it my duty. Yes, yes.
- What?!

17:06.390 --> 17:08.334
I am 43 calendar years old!

17:08.403 --> 17:11.037
That is two adults with
a seven year old on top!

17:11.105 --> 17:13.698
- Hi. Uh, please leave me alone.
- No.

17:13.723 --> 17:14.893
I can't do that, hon.

17:14.917 --> 17:16.877
I'm not gonna let this get to the point

17:16.903 --> 17:18.541
where I have to make a decision

17:18.567 --> 17:21.067
about whether or not to cut you open.

17:21.092 --> 17:22.223
Well, neither will I.

17:22.249 --> 17:24.278
Okay, so you'll let me break your water?

17:24.292 --> 17:26.012
I don't need you to break my water.

17:26.037 --> 17:28.429
Carol, I'm trying to
include you in this,

17:28.498 --> 17:31.350
but if you're not up to it, I
will make this decision for you.

17:31.375 --> 17:33.264
This is not your call to make!

17:33.289 --> 17:35.336
- I am her husband!
- And I am her mother!

17:35.438 --> 17:37.805
- And I am her her.
- Not now, Carol!

17:37.874 --> 17:40.342
Okay, look, yeah, I'm not
gonna let you turn our baby

17:40.367 --> 17:42.566
into some kind of human pin cushion.

17:42.591 --> 17:44.278
And what are you proposing, Dr. Pepper?

17:44.347 --> 17:46.547
You still want to stick
hot sauce up her holler?

17:46.616 --> 17:48.910
That was on a list, Gail! A list!

17:48.935 --> 17:51.228
Oh, my God, you're so clueless!

17:51.253 --> 17:52.653
Oh, how dare you! How dare you!

17:52.722 --> 17:55.523
How dare I. How dare I what?

17:55.591 --> 17:58.793
How dare I try to save the life
of your wife and unborn child?

17:58.861 --> 18:01.495
Oh, look at you, strutting
around with all the answers

18:01.564 --> 18:03.988
like some kind of
all-the-answers peacock!

18:04.867 --> 18:07.134
You know what? You should get
down on your bony, little knees

18:07.203 --> 18:08.969
- and thank the Lord above that I am here!
- Oh, yeah?

18:09.038 --> 18:10.571
- Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
- Oh, thank God for Gail!

18:10.640 --> 18:12.517
- Right.
- Thank God! What would I do without her?

18:12.542 --> 18:14.108
- That's right. You know why?
- Why?

18:14.177 --> 18:15.476
'Cause I'm the only shot

18:15.545 --> 18:17.111
you got right now, dummy.

18:17.180 --> 18:18.923
- You think so?
- I know so.

18:18.948 --> 18:19.914
You think so?

18:19.982 --> 18:22.149
- Yeah.
- And, Carol, you ought to shut your mouth

18:22.218 --> 18:24.452
and open your legs and
let me break that water.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.253
You hear me?

18:27.335 --> 18:28.389
Carol?

18:29.218 --> 18:30.360
Carol?

18:30.897 --> 18:33.653
Did someone order a double cheeseburger?

18:39.384 --> 18:40.369
Carol...

18:40.870 --> 18:43.164
I feel like I owe you an apology.

18:43.205 --> 18:46.072
Mom, come meet your
second granddaughter.

18:49.906 --> 18:52.189
- Hey, little one.
- Wait.

18:52.214 --> 18:54.414
In all the craziness,
we never picked a name.

18:54.526 --> 18:56.560
Oh, I got you covered.

18:56.585 --> 19:00.153
You both know I'm a very gifted namer.

19:00.188 --> 19:03.419
And I thought of the perfect
name for our daughter.

19:04.529 --> 19:05.857
Mike.

19:12.394 --> 19:15.134
Here we go. Oh.

19:18.152 --> 19:21.674
Hey, Mike. I'm your dad.

19:22.816 --> 19:26.369
You know, normally Mike is a guy's name.

19:26.394 --> 19:28.414
And kids might give you
a little flack for it,

19:28.450 --> 19:32.185
but, uh, Mike was my brother's name.

19:32.636 --> 19:34.687
And if you knew him,

19:34.723 --> 19:36.823
I'm sure you wouldn't mind.

19:40.212 --> 19:41.103
So,

19:41.128 --> 19:42.961
another painless birth, huh?

19:43.330 --> 19:46.751
Would you believe it was even
easier than the first one?

19:47.114 --> 19:50.436
And this time, I definitely orgasmed.

19:50.817 --> 19:53.618
Didn't I? Didn't I?

19:55.202 --> 19:57.135
Date night time. Let's hit it.

19:57.426 --> 19:59.710
Oh, are you guys taking
Dawn on your date night?

19:59.735 --> 20:04.077
Well, Tandy and Carol have
their hands full, and you're...

20:04.921 --> 20:05.785
you know.

20:06.429 --> 20:08.162
How about Todd?

20:09.139 --> 20:10.189
Really?

20:10.225 --> 20:12.959
Yeah, unless you're planning
on hitting the slopes.

20:12.994 --> 20:14.460
He's been doing a lot of cocaine.

20:14.496 --> 20:16.239
Look, it was baby powder, guys.

20:16.264 --> 20:17.697
That's what people say, yeah.

20:17.732 --> 20:20.133
But yeah, I'd love to. I'm...

20:20.644 --> 20:22.577
Are you-you sure?

20:23.738 --> 20:25.772
- Thank you.
- All right.

20:25.807 --> 20:27.373
Well, that settles it.

20:27.409 --> 20:28.908
I'll see you guys later.

20:29.412 --> 20:31.840
- Thank you.
- Bye, Dawn.

20:31.865 --> 20:33.310
Yes.

20:35.050 --> 20:36.378
