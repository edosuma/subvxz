grading tests is repetitive,

19:01.774 --> 19:03.674
Tedious, and time consuming.

19:04.577 --> 19:08.112
However, with swiftgrade,
all teachers need to do is take

19:08.181 --> 19:13.684
Their phone's camera, point it a
handwritten test, and instantly

19:13.752 --> 19:15.286
That test is graded.

19:15.955 --> 19:16.954
Wow.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.723
This means that a stack of

19:22.895 --> 19:24.529
In under 40 seconds.

Swiftgrade uses ai to read all

teacher scans each page,

the students' answers

20:50.650 --> 20:51.949

good.

20:51.951 --> 20:53.550

failed.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.088
[manjit] come on back up, vince
[laughs].

20:57.156 --> 21:01.358
So these are the tests that I
actually just scanned, and I'm

21:01.427 --> 21:03.594
Gonna click into the results,
and the first thing you can see

21:03.596 --> 21:06.330
Is that the teacher can see a
really good snapshot of just

21:06.398 --> 21:08.732
What the final scores were.

21:08.801 --> 21:12.036
But they can expand this down
and actually see how

21:12.038 --> 21:14.672
The students did and a breakdown
of everything.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.273
So, do you have to do a second
check through this

21:16.342 --> 21:18.142
For all the students that had
bad handwriting?

21:18.210 --> 21:21.812
So, what we have here is we have
a little filters button and you

21:21.880 --> 21:23.480
Can see it says "low accuracy."

21:23.549 --> 21:25.182
So swiftgrade will say, "look,
we're not sure about these ones.

21:25.250 --> 21:27.351
We need you to manually grade
this."

21:27.420 --> 21:30.488
[manjit] and so they would see
that on an app or a website?

21:30.556 --> 21:33.257
They'll see it on their student
portal.

21:33.325 --> 21:35.225
If not, it also emails them the
results.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.728
[arlene] and how long have you
been making this software?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.530
[ash] one year and one month.

21:39.598 --> 21:41.332
How much did it cost you to do
that?

21:41.400 --> 21:44.802
Yeah, so so far I've put in
$200,000 to do this.

21:44.870 --> 21:45.869
Whoa.

21:45.938 --> 21:48.472
[ash] and by the end when we're
gonna be launched,

21:48.541 --> 21:50.741
It'll be closer to $250,000.

21:50.743 --> 21:53.144
So nothing like this exists on
the market?

21:53.212 --> 21:57.081
Not in this way where you
can--the teacher scans a test

21:57.149 --> 22:00.050
And instantly like gets results.

22:00.119 --> 22:03.554
As an example, you know, a
multiple choice grading app

22:03.622 --> 22:07.157
Makes around $500,000 of revenue
a year.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.126
Literally exactly what I'm
doing, just for multiple choice.

22:09.195 --> 22:09.993
Right.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.028
So imagine what this can do.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.831
It's the same thing except with
handwriting.

22:13.899 --> 22:16.901
[manjit] but that's harder than
you think, to try to get money

22:16.969 --> 22:18.102
Out of schools.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.037

called let's talk english

22:20.106 --> 22:21.339

22:21.407 --> 22:22.339
Mm hmm.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.174
It was much harder than I
expected...

22:24.243 --> 22:25.175
Yeah, yeah.

22:25.244 --> 22:26.310
[manjit]...To sell into school
boards.

22:26.379 --> 22:28.479
They have budgets, they have
long timelines, of course.

22:28.547 --> 22:31.081
[manjit] they're very rigid to
try something new.

22:31.150 --> 22:33.451
So, how much would this cost
them to buy it?

22:33.519 --> 22:37.054
It's gonna be $10 u.S. A month,
so $12.50 canadian,

22:37.123 --> 22:40.324
Which would be $150
per year per teacher.

22:40.326 --> 22:41.859
-And that would be--
-per teacher.

22:41.861 --> 22:42.826
[ash] per teacher.

22:42.828 --> 22:45.596
And that would be for the whole
package.

22:45.598 --> 22:46.664
[michele] I have a really
important question.

22:46.732 --> 22:47.998
Yeah.

22:48.067 --> 22:50.267
[michele] do the teachers need
sign-off from their principal

22:50.335 --> 22:51.235
To use this?

22:51.237 --> 22:52.336
No.

22:52.404 --> 22:53.003
[michele] or can the teacher
just buy this and make

22:53.071 --> 22:53.870
Their life so much easier?

22:53.940 --> 22:54.671
[ash] the teacher can just buy
it.

22:54.740 --> 22:55.672
Yeah, exactly.

22:55.741 --> 22:56.807

about that.

what's your time worth?

25:19.619 --> 25:20.751
It used the basis of this
technology you're using.

25:20.819 --> 25:22.353
And I have a lot of authority to
talk on that because I built one

25:22.421 --> 25:25.622
Of the most successful ai
companies in canada.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.791
And then I can show you how to
scale and sell an app.

25:27.859 --> 25:31.261
Because I did so at a really
young age.

25:31.330 --> 25:32.963
I'll give you the $100,000 for
10%.

25:34.066 --> 25:40.003
-Okay, thank you, michele.
-[wes] I think you're great.

25:40.072 --> 25:43.040
Not only do you look great, but
you actually have some stuff

25:43.108 --> 25:45.409
In the brain too, so that's
always a good combination

25:45.411 --> 25:47.311
To have.

25:47.313 --> 25:49.346
-You're like me.
-[laughs]

25:49.415 --> 25:53.117
[wes] but I do believe that
you're not gonna take a deal

25:53.185 --> 25:54.285
From me.

25:54.353 --> 25:58.155
I think you want somebody else,
and so I'm not gonna put

25:58.157 --> 26:00.925
An offer on that for that very
reason, so I'm out.

26:00.993 --> 26:02.426
Thanks, wes.

26:05.030 --> 26:06.997
So, if you look at the things
I'm looking for, it's knowing

26:07.065 --> 26:09.600
How to sell into school boards
and those things, marketing,

26:09.668 --> 26:16.974
And tech, so would all three of
you consider going in together?

26:20.279 --> 26:22.212
And if yes, at what valuation?

26:24.016 --> 26:31.422
-You counter us.
-[ash] so...21%, 7% each.

26:33.792 --> 26:36.260
-For a $100,000?
-Yeah.

26:37.630 --> 26:38.629
I'm not trying to be greedy.

26:38.697 --> 26:39.829
-I just want the deal.
-[manjit] no, you're not.

26:39.899 --> 26:42.399
I need you guys to be invested
enough into it as well.

26:42.467 --> 26:44.401
-7%.
-What if...

26:47.974 --> 26:48.806
[manjit] um...

26:51.276 --> 26:54.311
[michele] okay, ash, the three
of us will go in at $100,000

26:54.379 --> 26:56.113
For 21%.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.514
-Congrats.
-Amazing, thank you so much.

26:57.983 --> 26:58.916
[manjit] looking forward to it,
ash!

27:57.943 --> 27:59.509
Hello, dragons!

27:59.512 --> 28:02.646
My name is lynzie kent; I live
in toronto, ontario, canada;

28:02.715 --> 28:04.615
And I am the founder of the
pop-up chapel co.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.753
Today, I'm seeking $200,000 in
exchange for 20% of my company.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.391
Over the past decade working in
the wedding industry,

28:14.393 --> 28:15.893
I noticed that couples' values
were shifting.

28:17.863 --> 28:20.497
Previously, a couple's only
option was to elope at city hall

28:20.800 --> 28:24.568
Or spend upwards of $30,000 on a
big banquet hall-style wedding.

28:25.570 --> 28:28.238
Sometimes even going into debt
for that.

28:28.240 --> 28:30.373
I knew there had to be a better
way for modern couples to get

28:30.442 --> 28:33.944
Married, so I applied the
sharing economy to weddings.

28:35.714 --> 28:37.848
At the pop-up chapel co.,
couples simply choose their

28:37.916 --> 28:40.651
Date, their location, and their
venue from our website.

28:42.387 --> 28:44.821
They pay a flat rate for their
time slot in the chapel,

28:44.890 --> 28:46.557
And that comes with everything
they need for their

28:46.625 --> 28:49.259
Wedding: Venue, décor,
photography, officiant,

28:49.327 --> 28:51.394
And so much more.

28:51.463 --> 28:53.764
And then they simply show up to
their wedding.

28:53.766 --> 28:57.467
For now, I wanted to bring a
chapel experience to you.

28:57.536 --> 28:58.401
-Take a look.
-[manjit] hmm.

28:58.470 --> 28:59.702
[michele] oh, let's see.

28:59.772 --> 29:02.773
Over the past four years, we've
married over 170 couples in our

29:02.841 --> 29:05.542
Chapels, but we've yet to strike
a deal with a dragon.

29:05.610 --> 29:09.446
So here I am, I'm just a girl
standing in front of a dragon,

29:09.448 --> 29:13.049
Asking you to marry me and join
the pop-up chapel co.

29:13.052 --> 29:14.017
In wedded bliss.

29:14.085 --> 29:15.085
[dragons] aww.

29:15.153 --> 29:17.287
Which one of you is ready to say
I do?

29:17.823 --> 29:19.389
[michele] so some of us on this
panel have been married

29:19.458 --> 29:20.290
A few times.

29:20.358 --> 29:21.291
[lynzie] yes.

29:21.360 --> 29:22.759
Some of us have been married no
times.

29:22.762 --> 29:23.927
-[manjit] oh goodness.
-[vincenzo] that's right.

29:23.929 --> 29:24.728
Some once.

29:24.797 --> 29:25.862
It's a nice combination up here.

29:25.931 --> 29:26.963
[michele] yeah.

29:27.032 --> 29:30.100
[wes] so, lynzie, what made you
decide to do this?

29:30.168 --> 29:32.069
So, I've been working in the
wedding industry for a really

29:32.137 --> 29:33.103
Long time...

29:33.171 --> 29:34.338
[manjit] okay.

29:34.406 --> 29:35.773
[lynzie]...And there is so much
that I love about the wedding

29:35.841 --> 29:38.675
Space, but there's a lot that I
didn't really like, so I thought

29:38.743 --> 29:41.044
Of, "well, how can I, you know,
create something that's really

29:41.112 --> 29:45.482
Spontaneous and fun but also
answers like what I'm feeling

29:45.550 --> 29:48.118
Like a lot of millennial and gen
z couples who are getting

29:48.186 --> 29:49.920
Married today actually want?"

29:49.988 --> 29:52.489
And so that's how I created the
chapel.

29:52.557 --> 29:55.525
How it works is ten couples get
married in one space

29:55.528 --> 29:56.927
At one of our pop-up chapels.

29:57.596 --> 29:59.996
They have about a 15 minute
non-denominational ceremony

30:00.065 --> 30:02.232
And then they do about a
40-minute cocktail hour.

30:02.301 --> 30:03.433
Those ten couples have the exact
same flowers,

30:03.502 --> 30:06.102
The exact same décor?

30:06.171 --> 30:07.304
Yes.

30:07.306 --> 30:09.339
[manjit] so is there any
personalization then?

30:09.408 --> 30:10.274
[lynzie] there is.

30:10.342 --> 30:11.741
There's a ton of personalization
actually.

30:11.810 --> 30:13.677
Choosing the music that they
walk down the aisle to,

30:13.745 --> 30:16.580
Having a say in what their
personal flowers look like.

30:16.648 --> 30:18.281
But then we have lots of
add-ons, so they can add

30:18.350 --> 30:20.383
On a cake or they could get
videography.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.085
So how much does it cost?

30:22.153 --> 30:25.689
[lynzie] so on average, a spot
is about $3,000.

30:25.757 --> 30:28.158
Wow, that's really reasonable.

30:28.160 --> 30:31.228
And where are you doing these
typically?

30:31.296 --> 30:33.430
[lynzie] we're doing these in
some of in some of ontario

30:33.498 --> 30:35.198
And canada's most
desirable venues.

30:35.267 --> 30:38.268
For example, the drake hotel,
evergreen brick works,

30:38.270 --> 30:39.803
The globe & mail centre.

30:39.871 --> 30:41.672
In vancouver, we're at the
hycroft manor.

30:41.740 --> 30:42.806
Those are all great venues.

30:42.808 --> 30:44.507
Literally the best venues in
canada.

30:44.576 --> 30:46.476
So we started this business four
years ago.

30:46.478 --> 30:50.480
Over 170 couples were married
through our chapels.

30:50.548 --> 30:52.115
So you did half a million
dollars in business?

30:52.183 --> 30:53.583
We actually did a million in
revenue so far.

30:53.586 --> 30:54.618
-But in four years?
-[lynzie] in four years.

30:54.686 --> 30:55.952
Yeah.

30:56.021 --> 30:58.822
In the past 12 months,
we've done $413,000.

30:58.824 --> 31:00.023
Okay.

31:00.091 --> 31:01.992
[michele] I actually think
there's a big market for this.

31:02.060 --> 31:03.994
I think that everyone younger is
looking

31:03.996 --> 31:05.896
At very different weddings.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.564
-Even if they have money.
-[lynzie] yeah.

31:07.632 --> 31:09.699
Their values have just
changed.

31:09.768 --> 31:12.102
[arlene] but what's your cost?

31:12.170 --> 31:15.239
Our cost for a chapel is
anywhere from $14,000 to

31:15.307 --> 31:18.842
$16,000, so our gross margin on
average per chapel is about 50%.

31:18.910 --> 31:23.046
[michele] so, lynzie, event
businesses are notoriously hard.

31:23.114 --> 31:26.516
To scale, there is no technology
that you can use.

31:26.584 --> 31:30.053
You are schlepping and building
weddings for years and years

31:30.122 --> 31:31.221
And years to come.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.491
And so, that's very hard to
scale.

31:34.559 --> 31:35.993
[lynzie] I totally agree with
you,

31:36.061 --> 31:38.728
Which is why I've done this.

31:38.731 --> 31:41.431
Because first of all, we don't
have to do nearly any

31:41.499 --> 31:43.734
Communication with our couples.

31:43.802 --> 31:45.902
-They literally choose their--
-they buy online.

31:45.971 --> 31:48.605
Choose it online and pay
online.

31:48.673 --> 31:49.940
[michele] yeah.

31:49.942 --> 31:52.175
[lynzie] the second piece is we
don't have to confirm designs

31:52.244 --> 31:53.210
With our couples.

31:54.513 --> 31:55.912
So I don't know ahead of time
what the décor of my wedding's

31:55.915 --> 31:57.914
Gonna be?

31:57.983 --> 31:58.949
No.

31:59.017 --> 32:00.250
You do realize my wife would
never go for that.

32:00.318 --> 32:03.019
I mean, it's her one single
special day.

32:03.022 --> 32:04.354
She wants to know what it's
gonna look like.

32:04.423 --> 32:05.855
[manjit] I totally agree with
you there.

32:05.924 --> 32:07.424
Because there's a lot of parts
to a wedding.

32:07.426 --> 32:08.224
Let's face it.

32:08.227 --> 32:09.559
Bridal shower, bachelor parties.

32:09.628 --> 32:12.562
Like, there's a lot of parts to
any wedding.

32:12.564 --> 32:15.165
It's so interesting when you see
this dynamic that's happening

32:15.233 --> 32:16.566
Right now.

32:16.568 --> 32:19.336
So I pitched a couponing app to
vcs, and every single one of

32:19.338 --> 32:21.938
Them looked at me, and they go,
"well, I'm gonna ask my wife

32:22.007 --> 32:23.506
If I would use my
couponing app."

32:23.575 --> 32:25.642
And I said, "please don't do
that.

32:25.711 --> 32:27.644
Like, you are a millionaire and
your wife doesn't care about

32:27.712 --> 32:28.878
Saving $20 on her grocery
bill."

32:28.947 --> 32:29.913
Right.

32:29.982 --> 32:31.848
[michele] and I could almost get
nobody interested.

32:31.917 --> 32:34.417
Because the group of people
you're talking to don't

32:34.420 --> 32:35.485
Understand your core customer.

32:35.554 --> 32:36.720
-You're not my client.
-They're not your client.

32:36.788 --> 32:37.921
Okay.

32:37.990 --> 32:39.289
[michele] because it's actually
remarkable what's happening

32:39.357 --> 32:41.791
Here, which is no one is
choosing to understand something

see themselves doing.

36:50.242 --> 36:52.442

36:52.444 --> 36:56.512
I was four years old, I was at
the top of a set of stairs

36:56.515 --> 36:59.115
And at the bottom was a glass
door of an apartment building,

36:59.184 --> 37:01.518
And I jumped and I hit the last
stair and I went through

37:01.586 --> 37:03.453

everything in my arm.

-Oh, that's--
-oh my god.

I'm working on it [laughs].

37:19.671 --> 37:22.305
[manjit] so tell me how this
idea came to fruition.

37:22.307 --> 37:25.742
I actually started it in a much
smaller scale,

37:25.810 --> 37:28.544
A<i> dragons' den</i> competition,
in my school district.

37:28.547 --> 37:29.679
Oh!

37:29.748 --> 37:31.681
So you can win a little bit of
money through that,

37:31.683 --> 37:33.249
Which was pretty exciting.

37:33.318 --> 37:35.518
And that gave me the initial
funding, about $5,000,

37:35.586 --> 37:38.488
To do my first production run.

37:38.556 --> 37:42.191
I realized that I wanted put a
lot more effort into it.

37:42.260 --> 37:45.629
I needed to transition and pivot
my business model a bit to being

37:45.697 --> 37:47.797
More online focused.

37:47.865 --> 37:50.366
Which was really kind of cool
for me because I transitioned

37:50.435 --> 37:56.105
To more e-commerce based sales
and paid ads, and that's kind

37:56.108 --> 37:59.576
Of seeming to be where it's at
for me going forward.

38:00.712 --> 38:03.046
So, maya, there's lots of cards
like this exist.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.282
I've actually played them with
my husband and my kids.

38:06.351 --> 38:09.386
So, what makes your cards so
unique?

38:09.454 --> 38:12.255
So, there's a couple different
competitors who do just

38:12.257 --> 38:14.824
The questions, and then there's
quite a few who have like

38:14.892 --> 38:18.461
Recipes or a lot of different
things in the middle.

38:18.529 --> 38:19.562
[manjit] yeah.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.131
[maya] just that little amount
of differentiation

38:21.199 --> 38:22.899
Has actually--

38:22.967 --> 38:24.767
[manjit] so, they're multiuse,
is that what you're saying?

38:24.836 --> 38:26.135
-Yeah, they're multipurpose.
-[manjit] I didn't even notice.

38:26.204 --> 38:27.637
Yeah, nine of clubs,
king of hearts, okay?

38:27.705 --> 38:28.904
[maya] yes.

38:28.974 --> 38:30.340
[manjit] and then you can use
them as the questions also.

38:30.408 --> 38:31.474
Totally.

38:31.542 --> 38:34.010
Maya, I've got a question for
you.

38:34.079 --> 38:36.079
What makes your business worth
$2.2 million?

38:38.182 --> 38:40.850
Okay, right.

38:40.852 --> 38:46.155
So right now, I have $1.7
million in overall revenue.

38:46.224 --> 38:47.824
-And--
-what?

38:47.892 --> 38:49.826
[vincenzo] excuse me?

38:49.828 --> 38:51.160
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.
-[arlene] what?

38:51.229 --> 38:52.261

-Holy smokes!

38:54.299 --> 38:55.932
[arlene] in the last--in how
long?

38:56.000 --> 38:59.602
$1.3 million of that is within
the last 12 months.

38:59.670 --> 39:00.803
-[manjit] come on!
-[wes and michelle] what?

39:00.872 --> 39:02.238
Why are you smiling all of a
sudden?

39:02.307 --> 39:04.607
Like, you're all happy to hear
$1.3 million--

39:04.675 --> 39:05.908
-[michele] yeah.
-[wes] why wouldn't I be happy?

39:05.977 --> 39:08.778
-You want me to be sad?
-What do they sell for?

39:08.847 --> 39:10.446
They're $13.95.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.781
That even makes it even more
phenomenal that you sold

39:11.850 --> 39:12.782
That many.

39:12.851 --> 39:13.983
Well, thank you.

39:14.052 --> 39:15.418
[arlene] how much have you
invested--on the marketing side,

39:15.487 --> 39:16.853
How much have you invested?

39:16.921 --> 39:19.089
About $400,000 in ad spend
throughout--

39:19.157 --> 39:20.123
[manjit] whoa.

39:20.125 --> 39:22.525
Yeah, so that's a big--big chunk
of it.

39:22.593 --> 39:23.927
-In the last 12 months?
-Yeah, in the last 12 months.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.161
[vincenzo] okay.

39:25.230 --> 39:27.363
So on $1.3 over the last 12
months, what's your net margin

39:27.366 --> 39:28.698
At the end?

39:28.700 --> 39:31.367
-$720,000 in profit.
-[vincenzo] $720,000?

39:31.436 --> 39:32.268
Wow.

39:32.337 --> 39:33.737
So, why do you need our money,
maya?

39:33.805 --> 39:36.272
[maya] okay, so a lot of that is
just being reinvested into new

39:36.340 --> 39:37.907
Stock right now.

39:37.909 --> 39:41.544
I'm also launching a new kids
edition coming out,

39:41.546 --> 39:44.313
And that's one I'm
super excited about.

39:44.316 --> 39:46.716
Maya, my questions aren't gonna
be from your cards, okay?

39:46.784 --> 39:48.151
All right!

39:48.219 --> 39:51.521
If you got the $220,000 that
you're looking for right now,

39:51.589 --> 39:52.989
How would you spend it?

39:55.193 --> 39:58.494
[maya] scaling it through adding
members to my team because right

39:58.563 --> 39:59.762
Now it's just me.

39:59.831 --> 40:03.866
And also just brand awareness,
spending more on marketing,

40:03.935 --> 40:05.301
And getting more inventory in.

40:05.369 --> 40:08.705
I'm just hoping to expand into a
lot more retailers so it's more

40:08.773 --> 40:09.639
Accessible...

40:09.707 --> 40:10.640
Right.

40:10.642 --> 40:12.575
...For people to go impulse buy
them.

40:12.644 --> 40:15.945
And I think retail space is just
where I need to go.

40:17.148 --> 40:19.415
So where do you see this
business ten years from now?

40:19.484 --> 40:24.086
I don't want it to be kind of a
one-trick pony situation,

40:24.155 --> 40:29.258
So I think ten years from now, I
would like to have at least

40:29.327 --> 40:30.527
Ten products out.

40:30.595 --> 40:32.729
-And how old are you?
-I'm 22.

40:32.797 --> 40:35.398
[michele] so I started just like
you,

40:35.467 --> 40:36.599
Winning a business
plan competition.

40:36.601 --> 40:38.034
That got me all the way to the
groupon acquisition,

40:38.102 --> 40:41.738
Was that early money
from those days.

40:41.806 --> 40:44.407
Okay, I don't know if I could
ever do what you're doing

40:44.409 --> 40:45.541
But that's incredible.

40:45.610 --> 40:46.309
-Of course you could!
-[wes] of course you could.

40:46.377 --> 40:48.778
Of course you could.

40:48.846 --> 40:55.351
So I'll give you the $220,000,
and I want a 5% royalty until I

40:55.420 --> 40:57.587
Get double my money back,
in addition to the 10%.

40:58.190 --> 40:59.622
Because I think you have the
margins to do that.

40:59.691 --> 41:03.426
I think we can easily get this
to $20, $30, $40, $50 million

41:03.495 --> 41:05.094
In sales.

41:05.162 --> 41:06.796
[arlene] I mean, your valuation
is reasonable,

41:06.864 --> 41:09.966
So I'll give you the
$220,000 for 10%.

41:11.002 --> 41:13.035
I know every major retailer in
this country, and every

41:13.038 --> 41:14.971
Independent retailer chain and
how to distribute

41:14.973 --> 41:16.105
In this country.

41:16.173 --> 41:17.306
This is what I do.

41:17.375 --> 41:18.842
I build brands exactly like
yours and could absolutely

41:18.910 --> 41:20.043
Help you.

41:20.111 --> 41:22.745
-And I think you're fabulous.
-[vincenzo] $300,000 for--

41:23.948 --> 41:27.450
[wes] so listen, when I told my
team that I'm going on<i> dragons'</i>

41:27.452 --> 41:30.787
<i> Den,</i> they said, "don't invest n
playing cards or games."

41:31.890 --> 41:32.788
That's the only instruction they
gave me, okay?

41:32.791 --> 41:34.123
Oh my gosh.

41:34.125 --> 41:37.126
[wes] but what they didn't tell
me was that somebody like you

41:37.128 --> 41:38.661
Was gonna come on the show.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.796
And I invest in people, and
you're one of those people

41:40.865 --> 41:44.800
That I definitely would like to
support and invest in, okay?

41:44.803 --> 41:46.068
Thank you.

41:46.137 --> 41:48.171
[wes] I think you should keep
your company, and what I would

41:48.239 --> 41:52.675
Do is $220,000 for 5% royalty
with no equity stake.

41:52.677 --> 41:54.210
Wow.

41:54.212 --> 41:55.745
Okay, that's amazing.

41:55.813 --> 41:56.946
[michele] that's a really good
deal.

41:57.015 --> 41:58.247
[maya] that is really good.

41:58.249 --> 41:59.482
[arlene] unless you want a
partner who's gonna actually get

41:59.550 --> 42:00.717
In the business and work with
you.

42:02.620 --> 42:04.787
So one dragon's good.

42:04.855 --> 42:05.989
Two dragons may be better.

42:09.160 --> 42:14.096
So, manjit and I will go and
we'll offer you $300,000

42:14.099 --> 42:15.465
For 10%.

42:15.533 --> 42:16.933
[maya chuckles]

42:16.935 --> 42:18.501
We have some desperate people
here.

42:18.569 --> 42:19.635
[manjit] you're worth it!

42:19.638 --> 42:20.803
I really do believe it.

42:20.805 --> 42:22.739
-You are worth it.
-Thank you, I appreciate it.

42:22.807 --> 42:24.140
So you have four offers on the
table.

42:24.208 --> 42:25.241
Holy smokes.

42:25.309 --> 42:26.743
Um...

42:28.879 --> 42:31.447
I'm just gonna think for a
second.

42:32.283 --> 42:33.750
[manjit] mm hmm.

42:36.054 --> 42:44.126
Okay, I really like the idea
of...Of royalty and not doing

42:44.195 --> 42:47.564
Equity, even though I was open
to it, of course.

42:48.165 --> 42:49.666
But...

42:51.168 --> 42:54.671
I really like your offer, wes,
and I would love to accept it.

42:54.739 --> 42:55.571
