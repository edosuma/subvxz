-(groans sharply)

00:41.617 --> 00:42.875
Oh, good. You're awake.

00:43.026 --> 00:44.710
Your timing
is just marvelous, dear.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.194
(oven dings)

00:46.272 --> 00:48.363
Now, isn't that just
the best sound there is?

00:48.382 --> 00:51.383
I swear
my mouth waters instantly.

00:52.628 --> 00:56.930
Nothing brings back memories
like a good smell.

00:57.466 --> 00:59.466
Don't you find?

00:59.618 --> 01:01.285
(groans) My head hurts.

01:01.287 --> 01:03.470
WOMAN:
Oh, hun, try not
to move around so much.

01:03.547 --> 01:05.213
I just got
the bleeding to stop.

01:05.232 --> 01:07.399
You were hit in the head
with a shovel.

01:10.738 --> 01:12.220
I was?

01:12.239 --> 01:13.313
By who?

01:13.465 --> 01:14.698
By me.

01:15.818 --> 01:17.659
Now, who's TK?

01:18.728 --> 01:19.578
It's my fiancé.

01:19.729 --> 01:22.581
Oh, you're getting married.

01:22.732 --> 01:23.990
That's so sweet.

01:24.143 --> 01:25.492
She must love you very much.

01:25.569 --> 01:29.254
She was texting nonstop
before I pulverized your phone

01:29.406 --> 01:31.757
with the meat tenderizer.

01:33.427 --> 01:36.503
My boy Darryl, he still
hasn't settled down yet.

01:36.580 --> 01:39.414
Just hasn't met
the right gal, I suppose.

01:39.491 --> 01:43.060
Well, hope springs eternal,
as they say.

01:44.346 --> 01:45.395
Here.

01:48.517 --> 01:50.150
Give this a nibble.

01:52.504 --> 01:53.595
No, thank you.

01:53.614 --> 01:54.613
WOMAN:
Don't be silly.

01:54.949 --> 01:58.325
I'm only offering you
a little piece of heaven.

01:59.044 --> 02:00.077
Open.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.773
There.

02:05.793 --> 02:07.376
What do you think?

02:08.295 --> 02:09.186
(softly) Hm.

02:09.188 --> 02:12.356
The secret is mixing sugars.

02:12.374 --> 02:15.876
Soft brown,
granulated white, muscovado,

02:16.028 --> 02:20.055
a flavor so deep
you can dive into it
headfirst.

02:24.370 --> 02:27.663
I-I didn't do this,
so you know.

02:27.665 --> 02:31.024
Um, poor thing had
an unfortunate accident.

02:33.045 --> 02:34.153
Ma'am?

02:35.156 --> 02:38.240
I need you to
untie my hands, please.

02:39.067 --> 02:40.975
I can't do that, sweetheart.

02:41.053 --> 02:43.403
My boy will be coming home soon,

02:43.480 --> 02:46.498
and I just know
he'll wanna meet you.

02:47.743 --> 02:50.752
(theme music plays)

02:52.822 --> 02:53.897
What is this?

02:53.899 --> 02:54.989
ROSE KACEY:
Thunderwear.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.066
Thunderwear?

02:56.084 --> 02:57.901
See these pouches here?

02:57.920 --> 02:59.069
Transmitter goes in there.

02:59.071 --> 03:00.495
And we'll replace a button

03:00.514 --> 03:02.239
in one of your shirts
with a microphone.

03:02.257 --> 03:04.925
Even if Sergeant O'Brien
asks you to open your shirt,

03:05.077 --> 03:06.076
he won't see anything.

03:06.078 --> 03:07.577
What if he asks me
to drop my pants?

03:07.596 --> 03:09.746
-I would not encourage that.
-OWEN STRAND: Okay.

03:09.765 --> 03:11.765
So what exactly
do you think he's gonna say?

03:11.767 --> 03:14.751
No idea. But he's obviously
got something to say.

03:14.753 --> 03:16.511
Otherwise, he wouldn't have
asked you to meet him.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.680
Yeah, in a secluded road
in the middle of nowhere.

03:18.682 --> 03:22.259
In his message, he said
there was a 99.9% chance

03:22.277 --> 03:23.368
that I wouldn't even show.

03:23.520 --> 03:26.263
So clearly he knows
I'm onto him, right?

03:26.265 --> 03:27.372
Without a doubt.

03:27.524 --> 03:28.932
He'd assume once
we checked out your bogus tip--

03:28.951 --> 03:30.042
It wasn't a bogus tip.

03:30.193 --> 03:31.526
There was
ammonium nitrate there.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.119
I should have taken
a picture of it.

03:33.196 --> 03:34.120
-Yeah, why didn't you?
-Because I didn't know

03:34.273 --> 03:35.697
you needed it
for your Instagram.

03:35.716 --> 03:39.292
Look, I thought the point was
to prevent a terror attack.

03:39.445 --> 03:40.219
It still is.

03:40.370 --> 03:42.036
So what exactly
are you thinking

03:42.114 --> 03:42.963
he's gonna confess?

03:43.039 --> 03:43.889
That he moved the stuff?

03:43.891 --> 03:44.890
CHUCK BIONDI: Maybe.

03:45.041 --> 03:47.451
Could be he's having
second thoughts.

03:47.544 --> 03:49.135
Maybe he just wants
to get rid of a witness.

03:49.288 --> 03:50.637
That would be great, actually.

03:50.789 --> 03:52.289
Excuse me?

03:52.307 --> 03:55.717
Look, if he tries anything,
we will be right there.

03:55.794 --> 03:58.886
But attempted murder
is all the leverage we need

03:58.964 --> 03:59.963
to get O'Brien to flip.

03:59.982 --> 04:02.799
(scoffs)
Well, fingers crossed, then.

04:02.801 --> 04:04.117
(cell phone ringing)

04:05.395 --> 04:06.319
It's my son.

04:06.472 --> 04:07.654
ROSE:
Do you have to take it?

04:07.731 --> 04:08.472
It's my son.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.474
Make it quick.

04:10.492 --> 04:12.084
Hey, TK. What's going on?

04:12.160 --> 04:13.310
Judd said you're
taking the day off.

04:13.328 --> 04:14.327
Is everything okay with you?

04:14.480 --> 04:16.980
Yeah. I'm taking a spa day.

04:16.999 --> 04:17.998
<i> I'm overdue.</i>

04:18.150 --> 04:19.091
Yes. Um, Dad,

04:19.318 --> 04:20.908
I really need
your advice on something.

04:21.487 --> 04:23.503
<i>You know how this</i>
<i>whole thing with Iris Blake</i>
<i>has really been a strain on us?</i>

04:23.580 --> 04:25.655
Yeah, I-I heard that they
found her safe yesterday.

04:25.657 --> 04:26.990
TK STRAND:
<i> Yes, she was.</i>

04:27.009 --> 04:27.749
In fact, Carlos found her,

04:28.010 --> 04:28.992
and I-I guess
he stayed with her

04:29.011 --> 04:30.010
overnight at the hospital.

04:30.162 --> 04:31.177
OWEN:
<i> Oh, he's a good one.</i>

04:31.330 --> 04:32.162
Yeah, he is.

04:32.164 --> 04:33.513
Except I think he's mad at me

04:33.665 --> 04:36.591
and he's not answering
my text messages and--

04:36.668 --> 04:37.925
Do you think
I should just go over there?

04:37.945 --> 04:39.336
Is that what you wanna do?

04:39.338 --> 04:40.504
TK:<i> Well, yeah, except</i>

04:40.522 --> 04:42.339
<i> I'm not sure if that's</i>
<i> what I should do.</i>

04:42.341 --> 04:43.931
Well, then maybe
just give him some space.

04:43.951 --> 04:44.932
Yeah, except, uh,

04:45.027 --> 04:45.859
remember when you and Mom

04:45.953 --> 04:47.027
were gonna give
each other space

04:47.121 --> 04:48.269
and then I got home
from Little League,

04:48.347 --> 04:49.346
and you were moving out?

04:49.348 --> 04:50.271
<i> That's definitely not</i>

04:50.349 --> 04:51.364
<i> what I want for us, Dad.</i>

04:51.517 --> 04:52.291
Your-- Your mother and I had

04:52.367 --> 04:54.017
much deeper issues than that.

04:54.019 --> 04:56.369
Um, look, my gut tells me...

04:56.446 --> 04:58.279
let Carlos be
the one to reach out.

04:58.357 --> 05:00.948
I think that this Iris situation
has been a lot to process.

05:01.026 --> 05:02.301
Uh, look, I really have to go.

05:02.528 --> 05:04.878
-What?
-OWEN:<i> Remember,</i>
<i> love is a roller coaster.</i>

05:05.030 --> 05:05.953
<i> Love conquers all.</i>

05:05.973 --> 05:06.880
<i> -And, uh--</i>
-Da--

05:06.956 --> 05:07.864
Just hang in there.

05:07.883 --> 05:09.308
-Dad!
-(phone beeping)

05:11.570 --> 05:13.537
It's the door. It just
doesn't line up with the jamb.

05:13.555 --> 05:15.872
I've been after Darryl
to fix it.

05:15.891 --> 05:16.873
(door opens)

05:16.892 --> 05:18.725
That's him. He's home.

05:18.877 --> 05:20.110
(rattling)

05:23.157 --> 05:25.473
Ma, what the hell?

05:25.551 --> 05:26.992
I made cookies.

05:27.828 --> 05:29.143
Seriously, Ma?

05:29.221 --> 05:31.663
The-- The house
wasn't ready for company.

05:34.150 --> 05:35.817
-DARRYL: Who is he?
-WOMAN: This is Carlos.

05:35.894 --> 05:36.893
He's engaged.

05:36.912 --> 05:37.985
What is he doing here?

05:38.063 --> 05:38.837
WOMAN:
He came through the floor

05:38.988 --> 05:41.231
and I hit him with the shovel.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.507
And you didn't think
to call me about this?

05:42.734 --> 05:44.176
WOMAN:
I don't like
to bother you at work.

05:44.327 --> 05:45.660
They said
you need to focus more.

05:45.737 --> 05:48.088
I went through all his pockets.
Everything is here.

05:48.182 --> 05:50.724
Except his gun
is in the crisper drawer.

05:52.427 --> 05:55.002
CARLOS REYES:
Sir, I-I think
we can resolve this.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.262
Your mother thought
that I was an intruder,

05:56.357 --> 05:57.430
but, really, I was just
exploring the property--

05:57.583 --> 05:59.441
Yeah, I know
what you were doing.

06:00.435 --> 06:01.693
Ma, he's a cop.

06:08.852 --> 06:10.869
Carlos Reyes.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.762
You're not a detective.

06:12.823 --> 06:14.289
What are you?

06:14.858 --> 06:16.357
A uniform cop?

06:16.435 --> 06:17.692
I remember you.

06:17.861 --> 06:19.878
You're one of the boys in blue
that was here yesterday.

06:20.029 --> 06:21.505
You carried her out of there.

06:22.198 --> 06:24.124
Why'd you come back?

06:24.126 --> 06:25.717
I was looking for you.

06:25.869 --> 06:27.552
Well...

06:27.779 --> 06:29.221
you found me.

06:29.372 --> 06:31.264
No one's gonna
find you, though.

06:31.892 --> 06:33.116
Ma, go get the kit.

06:33.135 --> 06:34.618
Do I have to?
He's getting married.

06:34.636 --> 06:36.286
DARRYL: (sighs)
Just go get the kit, okay?

06:36.288 --> 06:38.563
Uh, I'm not digging two holes.
My knee is acting out.

06:38.715 --> 06:40.123
No one's asking you to. Go!

06:40.125 --> 06:40.974
Did you get the bread?

06:41.126 --> 06:43.318
Would you just bring the kit?

06:52.395 --> 06:54.320
It's Donna Burton, isn't it?

06:54.397 --> 06:56.489
The girl in the closet.

06:56.566 --> 06:57.732
How many more are there?

06:57.793 --> 06:58.642
What are we gonna find

06:58.827 --> 07:00.477
when we dig up
the house next door?

07:00.495 --> 07:02.996
Dig it up. You're not
gonna find anything.

07:03.148 --> 07:04.648
Well, I found your tunnel.

07:04.666 --> 07:05.924
DARRYL: Yeah.

07:06.042 --> 07:07.909
Too bad for you.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.744
You're going back in it,

07:09.763 --> 07:12.389
and I'm gonna
seal up both sides.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.081
And that'll be that.

07:14.101 --> 07:15.341
I already called it in.

07:15.418 --> 07:17.561
DARRYL:
I don't think so.

07:18.847 --> 07:20.105
The blood's dried.

07:20.332 --> 07:23.090
I'm guessing you've been here
a few hours at least.

07:23.185 --> 07:25.944
Plus, you're a uniform cop.

07:26.095 --> 07:29.948
So... where's your uniform?

07:30.099 --> 07:31.933
I'm betting nobody
knows you're here.

07:31.952 --> 07:34.494
-(door opens)
-(footsteps approaching)

07:41.128 --> 07:42.127
Have you been getting into this?

07:42.204 --> 07:44.129
I told you,
my knee is acting out.

07:44.206 --> 07:45.279
But there's not enough here.

07:45.299 --> 07:46.039
Look at the size of him!

07:46.191 --> 07:47.207
Well, I don't want blood.

07:47.301 --> 07:49.676
DARRYL: Well, I don't
want blood, either.

07:51.379 --> 07:52.286
Alright.

07:52.380 --> 07:54.431
There's not enough
to put him down.

07:55.550 --> 07:59.202
But there's enough
to put him out

07:59.337 --> 08:03.707
while I make sure no one
finds that tunnel entrance.

08:03.725 --> 08:05.225
Get the hell away from me.

08:05.301 --> 08:07.134
You get the hell away from me!

08:07.154 --> 08:08.228
Get the hell away from me!

08:08.380 --> 08:10.547
Get off me! Get off me!

08:10.565 --> 08:12.491
Get the hell off me!

08:12.567 --> 08:13.658
(groans)

08:13.810 --> 08:15.619
Oh...

08:17.313 --> 08:18.330
Ah!

08:19.333 --> 08:20.499
Sweet dreams.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.967
♪♪

08:36.591 --> 08:40.093
Stop bumper bashing, bro,
and just call him.

08:40.169 --> 08:41.578
Nope. I'm the one
who screwed up,

08:41.580 --> 08:45.006
so I have to respect his space
and stay patient.

08:45.025 --> 08:46.233
Nailing it.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.194
Hey, man, that dude
is your fiancé, okay?

08:49.345 --> 08:51.363
He's not gonna bail at
the first little bump, alright?

08:51.514 --> 08:53.439
Except that little bump
is his wife.

08:53.592 --> 08:54.607
(laughs)

08:54.760 --> 08:57.944
Ask me, and Carlos
isn't the type of guy

08:58.096 --> 08:59.704
to pout and then ghost you.

09:01.433 --> 09:03.449
Wait. You-You think
something's wrong, too?

09:03.602 --> 09:06.770
I mean, not wrong,
but something
is definitely weird, yeah.

09:06.788 --> 09:07.712
See?

09:08.456 --> 09:09.455
But... (sighs)

09:09.532 --> 09:10.790
I've already texted him
so many times,

09:10.867 --> 09:12.458
I-I can't be the guy that...

09:12.611 --> 09:14.636
nags before
we're even married.

09:18.450 --> 09:19.975
But you could.

09:20.727 --> 09:21.726
Oh, no.

09:21.803 --> 09:22.894
TK:
Then call the hospital.

09:22.971 --> 09:24.287
You treated Iris yesterday.

09:24.289 --> 09:25.955
It-it's only natural
if you check in on her.

09:25.957 --> 09:27.290
Plus, if I call and he's there,

09:27.292 --> 09:29.317
it'll feel like I'm going
behind his back again.

09:29.961 --> 09:31.311
(softly) Please.

09:31.387 --> 09:33.554
(sighs) Okay.
You know what?

09:33.574 --> 09:35.073
Anything to make you stop

09:35.150 --> 09:36.983
vibrating like Liza Minnelli.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.618
-(laughs)
-Ohh. She's so nice.

09:43.917 --> 09:47.234

09:48.330 --> 09:50.088
Hi. Can you please
put me through

to Iris Blake's room?

09:52.334 --> 09:54.926
OPERATOR:
<i> She's sleeping.</i>

09:55.078 --> 09:56.261
<i> Should I wake her?</i>

09:56.412 --> 09:57.929
Oh, no, you don't
need to wake her up.

09:58.081 --> 10:01.415
Um, can I actually just speak
with her visitor, Carlos Reyes?

10:01.493 --> 10:03.977
OPERATOR:
<i> I'm sorry, she hasn't</i>
<i> had any visitors.</i>

10:05.088 --> 10:07.347
Could you...
check the log-in sheet?

10:07.423 --> 10:08.681

10:13.688 --> 10:14.988
Okay, thank you.

10:16.842 --> 10:18.691
Carlos isn't there.

10:18.768 --> 10:21.620
And no one has been
with her all night.

10:24.366 --> 10:26.866
ROSE:
Now remember
to just speak normally.

10:27.018 --> 10:28.368
This mike is very sensitive.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.370
So I shouldn't speak
into my shirt?

10:30.522 --> 10:32.205
And remember,
we'll be nearby.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.539
If things go south,

10:33.692 --> 10:35.358
our response time
is no more than 90 seconds.

10:35.377 --> 10:37.802
And that's faster
than a bullet, right?

10:37.954 --> 10:38.970
Alright, it's time.

10:39.865 --> 10:40.764
(exhales deeply)

10:46.129 --> 10:48.538
Captain Strand,
can we get a test?

10:48.556 --> 10:51.483
Test, test, O'Brien.
Please don't murder me.

10:54.804 --> 10:56.404
(gate closes)

10:58.492 --> 11:00.533
(engine starts, roars)

11:05.907 --> 11:10.001
-Oh. Hey, Grace, uh, you have
a personal call coming in.
-GRACE RYDER: Hm?

11:11.505 --> 11:12.228
This is Grace.

11:12.230 --> 11:13.579
Hey, Grace. It's TK.

11:13.732 --> 11:16.508
GRACE (over phone):
<i> Hey, TK.</i>
<i> What can I do for you?</i>

11:16.659 --> 11:18.968
Something probably illegal.

11:19.571 --> 11:20.327
Okay.

11:20.347 --> 11:21.495
TK:
<i> Carlos has gone AWOL.</i>

11:21.573 --> 11:22.572
I've tried everything,

11:22.757 --> 11:24.908
and I was hoping
you could locate his phone.

11:24.926 --> 11:26.409
Well, it's not entirely legal,

11:26.428 --> 11:28.578
but it's not entirely
illegal either.

11:28.596 --> 11:30.263
Okay. Do you need
his personal number?

11:30.415 --> 11:31.614
GRACE:
<i> Nope. I got it.</i>

11:31.616 --> 11:33.266
Let me see
if I can find his carrier.

11:33.342 --> 11:35.601
I can put in a request
for his phone records, too.

11:35.678 --> 11:38.104
But I do have his IMEI
in front of me.

11:38.181 --> 11:39.714
Well, can you track down
where the phone is now?

11:39.791 --> 11:41.107
Hm.

11:41.184 --> 11:42.608
It's not picking up a signal.
Hold on.

11:42.685 --> 11:45.352
What does that mean?
Is it turned off?

11:45.430 --> 11:48.264
No, that's strange.
It's disconnected.

11:48.283 --> 11:50.357
Which means either
the battery was removed

11:50.435 --> 11:52.419
or the phone was destroyed.

11:56.291 --> 11:58.458
I can slit his throat
in the bathtub.

11:58.534 --> 12:00.610
WOMAN:
I just got the ring
out of that tub.

12:00.628 --> 12:03.888
How about strangulation?
That's fairly tidy, isn't it?

12:03.965 --> 12:05.298
I understand
they lose their bowels,

12:05.450 --> 12:06.449
but we can put something down.

12:06.451 --> 12:08.209
Ma, it's not like the movies.

12:08.261 --> 12:10.044
It takes forever
and they fight back.

12:10.063 --> 12:12.288
Besides, look at
the size of his neck.

12:12.290 --> 12:13.790
It's like a tree stump.

12:13.792 --> 12:17.293
Alright, I gotta run out
and ditch his car anyway.

12:17.312 --> 12:18.737
Then I can swing back by work

12:18.888 --> 12:20.554
and pick up the stuff
we need to finish this.

12:20.723 --> 12:23.408
WOMAN: What if someone else
comes through the hole
while you're out?

12:23.485 --> 12:25.226
DARRYL:
What do you think I've been
doing for the last hour?

12:25.303 --> 12:26.636
I sealed that end up.

12:26.729 --> 12:28.321
Nobody else is coming through

12:28.397 --> 12:29.730
because nobody else
is gonna find it.

12:29.750 --> 12:32.625
Try using that pea brain
of yours for once.

12:36.831 --> 12:38.006
(door shuts)

12:38.925 --> 12:41.150
(muffled)
He didn't mean that.

12:41.152 --> 12:42.552
How about some music?

Carlos isn't here, is he?

No. Um, come on in.

14:50.448 --> 14:52.373
-ANDREA REYES: TK!
-Um--

14:52.450 --> 14:53.725
ANDREA: Perfect timing.

14:53.876 --> 14:56.377
I made vegan chili
and cauliflower tacos
for lunch.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.638
Of course, this one thinks
I'm trying to kill him.

15:00.216 --> 15:01.290
What's wrong,<i> mijo?</i>

15:01.309 --> 15:03.126
GABRIEL REYES:
TK's looking for Carlos.

15:03.144 --> 15:04.718
What does that mean,
"looking"?

15:04.738 --> 15:05.403
He's at work, no?

15:05.630 --> 15:07.813
No, he's off today. Um...

15:07.966 --> 15:08.965
He was supposed
to see Iris Blake

15:08.967 --> 15:10.224
at the hospital last night.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.151
How is she doing?
We were gonna visit her later.

15:12.228 --> 15:13.077
TK: She's good.

15:13.229 --> 15:14.153
Um, except he wasn't

15:14.230 --> 15:14.987
at the hospital last night.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.822
I have no idea where he was.

15:16.899 --> 15:18.157
And I've been
calling him all day,

15:18.234 --> 15:19.400
and he's not answering me.

15:19.477 --> 15:21.235
I even had Grace
track down his phone.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.546
It seems to be
disabled or something.

15:24.999 --> 15:26.482
ANDREA: Oh, my God.

15:26.501 --> 15:28.092
-Gabriel.
-It's okay. Alright,

15:28.319 --> 15:29.177
let's not panic.
Let's not panic.

15:30.004 --> 15:31.320
Was he driving his own car?

15:31.473 --> 15:33.489
-Yes.
-ANDREA: Yes, the car.
You can track the car.

15:33.491 --> 15:35.624
Well, actually, no,
he didn't purchase that option.

15:35.626 --> 15:37.584
He could barely afford the car
at the time, remember?

15:37.679 --> 15:40.496
But I can put a BOLO
out on our son and the car.

15:40.498 --> 15:41.347
-Okay?
-GABRIEL/TK: Okay.

15:41.499 --> 15:42.923
-(cell phone buzzing)
-Oh, hey.

15:43.001 --> 15:44.108
This might be him.

15:44.185 --> 15:45.501
It's Grace.

15:45.520 --> 15:48.854
Hey, Grace. I'm-- I'm here
with Carlos's parents.

15:48.949 --> 15:50.173
Please tell me
you found his phone.

15:50.191 --> 15:51.282
GRACE (over phone):
<i> No, baby, I'm sorry,</i>

15:51.434 --> 15:54.010
<i> but I can tell you</i>
<i> the last call he made.</i>

15:54.028 --> 15:55.344
<i> It was to you at 10:43,</i>

15:55.346 --> 15:56.621
<i> but there was</i>
<i> nothing after that.</i>

15:56.848 --> 15:58.957
Yeah, I-I thought
he was calling me
from the hospital.

15:59.033 --> 16:00.516
Well, actually, he was calling

16:00.535 --> 16:02.609
from the house
where he found Iris.

16:02.629 --> 16:04.520
Why would he go back there?

16:04.539 --> 16:06.447
GRACE:
<i> I don't know.</i>
<i> But it was off the books.</i>

16:06.466 --> 16:07.206
<i> He didn't call it in.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:08.374
Grace, this is Major Reyes.

16:08.526 --> 16:10.551
Can you send us
that address, please?

16:14.866 --> 16:17.517
(rock music playing
over speakers)

16:21.206 --> 16:22.397
Let's have your phones.

16:24.058 --> 16:26.067
You can hand 'em over
and or we'll take 'em.

16:33.994 --> 16:35.384
I ain't talking to those two.

16:35.386 --> 16:38.454
Come on, Turner.
Get up. Let's go.

16:51.494 --> 16:53.160
What the hell
is going on, O'Brien?

16:53.179 --> 16:54.345
What the hell
does it look like?

16:54.497 --> 16:55.087
It looks like,

16:55.331 --> 16:56.255
<i> I think that you're acting</i>

16:56.424 --> 16:58.241
<i> like you're not</i>
<i> a part of this again.</i>

16:58.243 --> 16:59.333
O'BRIEN:
<i> I'm not one of them.</i>

16:59.410 --> 17:00.351
OWEN:<i> Really?</i>
<i> Because I've been told</i>

17:00.428 --> 17:02.228
<i> you're actually</i>
<i> a founding member.</i>

17:02.838 --> 17:04.171
(scoffs)

17:04.249 --> 17:05.873
So you're not gonna deny it?

17:05.950 --> 17:07.917
Okay. Yes.

17:07.919 --> 17:11.937
I started a biker club
called the Honor Dogs
21 years ago.

17:12.014 --> 17:13.180
Just after 9/11.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.700
Bikers, mostly first responders.

17:15.851 --> 17:18.094
Then something happened,
something changed this place,

17:18.112 --> 17:19.428
and that's when I left.

17:19.430 --> 17:20.687
I quit.

17:20.932 --> 17:23.357
And so did all the other guys
that I started it with.

17:23.434 --> 17:25.043
I came in
through those doors
six weeks ago.

17:25.194 --> 17:27.045
They had no idea who I was.

17:27.196 --> 17:29.047
So much for tradition.

17:30.258 --> 17:32.533
So you want me to believe
that your nephew

17:32.552 --> 17:37.388
just wandered in to
a radicalized version
of some club

17:37.465 --> 17:39.390
that you founded
two decades ago?

17:39.542 --> 17:41.208
Andy always wanted
to be an Honor Dog

17:41.227 --> 17:42.376
since he was, like, seven.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.378
We used to call him
"Honor Pup."

17:44.455 --> 17:46.547
(chuckles)

17:46.566 --> 17:48.791
So maybe he isn't
working for the government.

17:48.810 --> 17:49.567
I don't know about that.

17:49.961 --> 17:51.811
They sure as hell
think that we do.

17:51.963 --> 17:53.404
The feds raided
their farm last night.

17:53.481 --> 17:56.315
Oh, I know.
The ammonium nitrate is gone.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.983
Someone moved it,
and I think it's you.

17:58.078 --> 17:59.393
-Wasn't me.
-OWEN: Come on.

17:59.487 --> 18:01.395
How did they know that you and I
were gonna meet today?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.655
Well, they asked me
to call you.

18:02.731 --> 18:04.156
You lured me into a trap?

18:04.233 --> 18:06.066
I warned you not to come,
didn't I?

18:06.086 --> 18:09.712
"99.9% you don't show"?

18:11.165 --> 18:12.815
Nine, nine, nine?

18:12.817 --> 18:13.925
Police code?

18:14.076 --> 18:15.151
Officer down?

18:15.153 --> 18:17.595
Oh God. I'm a fireman.

18:17.672 --> 18:20.005
Our codes are like, "fire."

18:20.158 --> 18:21.490
Just be cool, Strand.

18:21.492 --> 18:23.559
They've got nothing on us.
We'll be fine.

18:26.922 --> 18:28.481
I'm wearing a wire.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.443
Oh, we're screwed.

18:37.358 --> 18:40.076
(upbeat song playing
on radio)

18:49.854 --> 18:51.712
(music continues)

18:57.211 --> 18:58.377
Sorry for the mess.

18:58.454 --> 18:59.620
WOMAN:
Don't be silly.

18:59.639 --> 19:02.047
What's a head supposed to do
against a shovel

19:02.200 --> 19:05.217
but crack open a little?

19:05.370 --> 19:06.644
Floors needed
a shine, anyway.

19:06.795 --> 19:10.189
I can see how much effort
you put into making a nice home.

19:11.058 --> 19:13.300
I'm sorry. I...

19:13.378 --> 19:14.894
I don't know your name.

19:14.970 --> 19:16.404
It's Trudie.

19:17.139 --> 19:17.971
And thank you.

19:17.991 --> 19:20.700
Trudie. That's nice.

19:24.238 --> 19:27.390
I hope Darryl
appreciates all the--

19:27.392 --> 19:29.750
all the trouble
you go through for him.

19:31.171 --> 19:33.004
You know
this isn't personal, right?

19:33.080 --> 19:34.488
What needs to happen.

19:34.565 --> 19:37.008
It doesn't need
to happen, Trudie.

19:37.159 --> 19:38.342
I promise you it doesn't.

19:38.494 --> 19:40.178
I wish it didn't.

19:41.531 --> 19:44.089
I wish you hadn't
come up through that floor.

19:44.166 --> 19:45.725
Truly, I do.

19:59.032 --> 20:00.756
This must be
where they found her.

20:00.758 --> 20:01.741
Iris.

20:08.449 --> 20:11.375
There's only one door
in and out of this place.

20:11.452 --> 20:13.044
And it looks like
it was kicked in.

20:13.195 --> 20:14.437
DETECTIVE GRIER:
It was.

20:14.455 --> 20:15.771
By Austin PD.

20:15.790 --> 20:17.440
It was locked from the inside
when we found her.

20:17.458 --> 20:19.108
Detective Meredith Grier.
Missing Persons.

20:19.126 --> 20:20.276
And I sure as hell hope your son

20:20.278 --> 20:21.444
isn't my next case,
Major Reyes.

20:21.462 --> 20:23.704
And so do I.
Thank you for meeting with us.

20:23.798 --> 20:25.798
-GRIER: Yeah.
-How do you think
your suspect escaped?

20:25.950 --> 20:28.467
Um, to be honest,
I'm not convinced
there was a suspect.

20:28.619 --> 20:31.044
GABRIEL:
You think Iris Blake
was hallucinating?

20:31.122 --> 20:32.121
She does have a history.

20:32.123 --> 20:33.956
TK:
Oh, come on.
That is such BS.

20:33.975 --> 20:35.140
First, you didn't believe Carlos

20:35.293 --> 20:36.216
when he said
she didn't walk away,

20:36.236 --> 20:37.235
and now you're
not believing Iris?

20:37.386 --> 20:39.462
I treated her in the ambulance.

20:39.480 --> 20:40.829
Unless she did it to herself.

20:40.831 --> 20:43.741
Attackers don't generally
just vanish into thin air.

20:43.892 --> 20:45.634
Yeah, and neither
does my fiancé.

20:45.653 --> 20:47.894
There is no way in hell
Carlos would disappear

20:47.972 --> 20:48.971
unless something happened.

20:48.973 --> 20:51.749
Okay, TK.
Calm down. Son?

20:51.900 --> 20:53.960
Let me just have a moment
with the detective, okay?

20:58.499 --> 21:00.149
He's right, you know.

21:00.151 --> 21:01.650
-GRIER: I do.
-GABRIEL: You have a theory.

21:01.652 --> 21:04.153
GRIER:
About 12% of houses
in this neighborhood

21:04.155 --> 21:06.839
are just like this one:
run-down, abandoned.

21:06.915 --> 21:08.841
-You know what that attracts.
-GABRIEL: The criminal element.

21:08.993 --> 21:10.083
-GRIER: That's right.
-(TK panting)

21:10.177 --> 21:12.419
And the last time
anyone heard from your son

21:12.438 --> 21:14.330
was late at night
outside this house,

21:14.348 --> 21:16.348
in a shiny car
that we cannot find.

21:16.442 --> 21:19.110
So you're checking
the hospitals and morgues?

21:19.261 --> 21:20.111
Yes.

21:20.187 --> 21:21.687
GABRIEL:
My son is resourceful,

21:21.764 --> 21:23.281
and he can take care of himself.

21:23.357 --> 21:25.116
GRIER:
I have no doubt that's
how you raised him.

21:25.267 --> 21:28.160
GABRIEL:
No, he figured that out
on his own.

21:30.197 --> 21:32.456
TK:
Gabriel? Detective?

21:34.460 --> 21:35.351
GABRIEL: What?

21:35.611 --> 21:36.685
I just found this
in the fireplace.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.254
Looks like someone was
trying to get rid of it.

21:39.948 --> 21:42.024
-GRIER: Donna Burton.
-Does that name
mean anything to you?

21:42.043 --> 21:43.950
Iris said she was out
looking for a Donna Burton

21:43.970 --> 21:45.303
when she was taken.

21:45.454 --> 21:47.120
So maybe the guy
who took Iris
took Donna, too,

21:47.140 --> 21:48.306
and then brought them
both back here.

21:48.415 --> 21:50.457
Did you have Forensics
go over this house?

21:50.535 --> 21:52.885
We weren't looking for evidence
of multiple abductions.

21:53.037 --> 21:54.053
GABRIEL:
Well, maybe you should be.

21:54.205 --> 21:55.146
And I'd get
some officers out here

21:55.222 --> 21:56.055
to canvass the neighborhood,

21:56.207 --> 21:57.206
find out if anybody

21:57.224 --> 21:58.223
heard anything last night.

21:58.300 --> 21:59.400
Yeah.

22:01.379 --> 22:03.029
I'm not waiting for them.

22:07.234 --> 22:09.327
(indistinct radio chatter)

22:09.403 --> 22:10.569
Oh, dear.

22:10.721 --> 22:13.497
Darryl is not gonna
like this one bit.

22:16.151 --> 22:17.409
CARLOS:
Wait, what are you doing?

22:17.562 --> 22:19.078
No, no, no, no.
It's okay. It's okay.

22:19.154 --> 22:20.821
(muffled)
No, no, no, no. (groans)

22:20.898 --> 22:22.048
(doorbell rings)

22:24.902 --> 22:26.677
(moaning)

22:27.572 --> 22:29.555
(Trudie panting)

22:31.017 --> 22:32.350
(Carlos groaning)

22:32.501 --> 22:35.853
Please. No, please.
Please stay quiet.

22:36.004 --> 22:38.981
I don't wanna have to
scrub up another mess.

22:40.509 --> 22:42.735
(knocking on door)

22:48.201 --> 22:50.183
Hello. Can I help you?

22:50.261 --> 22:51.276
I sure hope so.

22:51.429 --> 22:52.853
I'm sure you've seen
all the police activity.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.354
TRUDIE:
I didn't really.

22:54.374 --> 22:56.374
Sad to say,
it's nothing new around here.

22:56.450 --> 22:58.283
Things have gotten
so bad lately.

22:58.285 --> 23:00.044
We're asking people
if they heard or saw

23:00.195 --> 23:01.712
anything unusual last night.

23:01.789 --> 23:05.198
TRUDIE:
No. No, I-I can't say
that I did. (slight chuckle)

23:05.276 --> 23:06.759
<i> Have you seen this man?</i>

23:11.391 --> 23:15.467
Well... he's very handsome,
isn't he?

23:15.544 --> 23:18.437
Yeah, I think so.
He's my fiancé.

23:19.882 --> 23:21.306
Is that so?

23:21.383 --> 23:23.550
We think he went missing
in this area last night.

23:23.628 --> 23:25.218
Possibly from the house
right next door.

23:25.296 --> 23:27.071
Are you sure you haven't
seen anything?

23:27.222 --> 23:28.647
It would have been
after 10:00 p.m.

23:28.799 --> 23:29.648
I'm sorry.

23:29.967 --> 23:32.968
I'm off to dreamland
by 9:30 most nights.

23:32.987 --> 23:36.229
TK:
Does anybody else live in here
that might've seen something?

23:36.307 --> 23:38.140
TRUDIE:
My son works the night shift.

23:38.159 --> 23:40.042
He wouldn't have been at home.

23:40.995 --> 23:42.628
-(clattering)
-Oh!

23:44.165 --> 23:45.981
What's that cat got into?

23:46.000 --> 23:48.592
Whiskers, off the counter.

23:48.744 --> 23:50.669
I'm sorry I couldn't have
been of more help,

23:50.821 --> 23:53.172
but I have to go spank my cat.

23:53.248 --> 23:54.657
<i> Alright. Um, I'm TK.</i>

23:54.675 --> 23:56.175
<i> If-if anything comes to mind,</i>

23:56.343 --> 23:59.344
<i> please reach me</i>
<i> or the lead detective</i>
<i> at this number. Okay?</i>

23:59.497 --> 24:02.648
I'll be sure to do that.
Bye-bye.

24:12.693 --> 24:15.119
I didn't know you were a gay.

24:15.863 --> 24:17.846
I love the gays.

24:17.940 --> 24:20.440
Sometimes I wish
my Darryl was a gay.

24:20.460 --> 24:23.752
The ladies give him
so much trouble.

24:29.376 --> 24:30.617
GRIER:
Two more possibles.

24:30.711 --> 24:33.545
Allyson Beatrice,
reported missing, August 2021.

24:33.698 --> 24:36.699
Audrey McKenna.
Last seen leaving her
halfway house in 2019.

24:36.717 --> 24:39.051
GABRIEL:
Alright, so it looks
like a pattern.

24:39.203 --> 24:41.220
All reported missing
in the last five years.

24:41.372 --> 24:43.038
All transient.
Either homeless

24:43.057 --> 24:44.556
or in and out
of halfway houses.

24:44.633 --> 24:46.225
GRIER:
He's targeting
the most vulnerable.

24:46.377 --> 24:48.652
Women on the fringe of society.

24:48.729 --> 24:52.381
Well, at least now you think
that there is a he.

24:52.383 --> 24:54.566
Look, I get that
this is important, I really do.

24:54.719 --> 24:57.236
I just don't understand
why we're searching for women,

24:57.388 --> 24:58.887
some of them that have
been missing for years,

24:58.889 --> 25:01.390
when we should be out there
looking for Carlos right now.

25:01.392 --> 25:02.816
This is how we find him, son.

25:02.835 --> 25:04.585
Yeah, but he's not
a transient woman!

25:05.654 --> 25:06.745
I'm sorry, okay?

25:07.064 --> 25:10.582
I just don't understand
how this is gonna help us.

25:10.735 --> 25:14.236
You're talking about,
what, a-a serial killer?

25:14.255 --> 25:16.972
-Yeah, we are.
-Okay, so, what,
you think that--

25:25.750 --> 25:27.399
You think that Carlos--

25:28.361 --> 25:31.028
TK, you need
to let us do our job.

25:33.533 --> 25:35.348
We're not gonna
find him alive, are we?

25:35.426 --> 25:37.701
I have to believe
that we will.

25:38.871 --> 25:41.038
Right. Because whoever
killed these women,

25:41.189 --> 25:44.124
and that's what we're saying,
is that, is that
they're all dead.

25:45.211 --> 25:46.192
More than likely, yeah.

25:46.270 --> 25:47.545
How are you so calm right now?

25:47.621 --> 25:49.547
You don't think
this is tearing me up?

25:50.624 --> 25:53.233
What I might have
to go tell his mother?

25:53.310 --> 25:55.594
You're not the only one
who loves him, TK.

25:57.281 --> 25:59.181
But if there are
tears to weep...

26:00.301 --> 26:02.451
we do it
when the time comes.

26:02.469 --> 26:03.561
Not before.

26:04.622 --> 26:05.896
And right now,

26:06.048 --> 26:07.690
he needs us.

26:09.293 --> 26:10.067
Yeah?

26:14.465 --> 26:15.489
Good.

26:17.076 --> 26:18.483
(sighs)
They found his Camaro

26:18.636 --> 26:20.135
abandoned off 71,
near Garfield.

26:20.154 --> 26:21.245
Seems like someone dumped it.

26:21.396 --> 26:22.580
GABRIEL:
Was there any blood in the car?

26:22.807 --> 26:24.915
GRIER:
No blood, no prints either.
Wiped clean.

26:25.067 --> 26:27.084
-You wanna run out
and take a look?
-No. No.

26:27.161 --> 26:28.961
Here is where
we're gonna find him.

26:33.926 --> 26:36.093
(rock-and-roll music playing)

26:43.828 --> 26:45.661
-Alright.
-Hey, get him a beer.

26:45.679 --> 26:48.606
At least they give you a beer
when they're done.

26:48.682 --> 26:50.107
See the cue stick behind you?

26:50.184 --> 26:51.500
After I tackle Red,

26:51.593 --> 26:54.002
snap it over your knee
and toss me the other half.

26:54.021 --> 26:57.189
Or... they could
raid this place right now.

26:57.265 --> 26:59.007
-Stop talking in your shirt.
-Yeah.

26:59.026 --> 27:00.509
So, boys...

27:00.527 --> 27:03.345
I just had a very
interesting conversation

27:03.347 --> 27:04.955
with Brother Turner over there.

27:05.625 --> 27:06.606
Yeah? A conversation?

27:06.775 --> 27:09.518
You do a lot of talkin'
with your hands.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.370
He brought
two unbranded people

27:11.446 --> 27:13.113
to a place that he
wasn't supposed to.

27:13.132 --> 27:15.132
He understands
the consequences.

27:15.209 --> 27:17.635
Now, normally,
I wouldn't hold two newcomers

27:17.786 --> 27:19.119
to the same high standard.

27:19.138 --> 27:20.212
But we got a problem here.

27:20.364 --> 27:21.546
<i> After you three trespassed</i>

27:21.699 --> 27:22.473
<i> and shot the place up,</i>

27:22.791 --> 27:24.290
<i> and I don't know,</i>
<i> went exploring?</i>

27:24.385 --> 27:27.978
<i> We got raided by</i>
<i> the Federal Bureau</i>
<i> of Investigation.</i>

27:28.055 --> 27:29.054
<i> They didn't find anything.</i>

27:29.390 --> 27:30.648
<i> But for some reason,</i>
<i> they thought they would.</i>

27:30.799 --> 27:33.375
Now why do you
suppose that is?

27:33.377 --> 27:35.227
I don't know, since when does
the federal government

27:35.303 --> 27:37.229
need a reason to trample
on somebody's rights?

27:37.305 --> 27:39.531
I think we got a rat.

27:40.326 --> 27:42.234
You think Turner's the rat.

27:42.386 --> 27:45.311
Well, I can tell you,
he's also a cheat at pool.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.222
Turner's too stupid to be a rat.

27:47.224 --> 27:49.315
And he's not pool player enough
to be a cheat.

27:49.393 --> 27:52.394
Which does make me wonder
how bad you are, Captain,

27:52.413 --> 27:54.246
to lose nine
straight games to him?

27:54.398 --> 27:57.091
-Well, I'm not great.
-He's right. He sucks.

27:58.160 --> 28:01.178
Look... you don't think
I'm the rat.

28:01.329 --> 28:03.722
We met on the road
and you invited me here.

28:04.575 --> 28:05.574
Yeah.

28:05.910 --> 28:07.926
Yeah, I keep thinking about
how we just happened

28:08.078 --> 28:09.353
to meet on the road

28:09.504 --> 28:11.522
and how you two already
seem to know each other.

28:11.673 --> 28:14.191
Of course, we know each other.
We've been on calls together.

28:14.268 --> 28:16.176
He even wrote me a ticket once.

28:16.195 --> 28:18.511
What I can't figure out is...

28:18.531 --> 28:21.106
<i> is it just one of you</i>
<i> working for the feds,</i>

28:21.258 --> 28:22.682
<i> or is it both?</i>

28:22.702 --> 28:25.260
It's both.

28:25.279 --> 28:26.778
I'm a police officer
and he's a fire captain.

28:26.931 --> 28:28.539
We're both
government employees.

28:28.615 --> 28:30.115
And we're not gonna
disappear as easy as

28:30.267 --> 28:33.118
some 26-year-old
high school dropout.

28:33.270 --> 28:34.694
What was that supposed to mean?

28:34.714 --> 28:35.879
You know what the hell it means.

28:36.031 --> 28:38.716
Andy Pearson. Where is he?

28:40.127 --> 28:42.720
(tense music playing)

28:42.871 --> 28:46.056
I don't know what to tell you.
Andy, he's just kinda...

28:47.393 --> 28:48.434
gone.

28:48.894 --> 28:49.977
Is that so?

28:51.379 --> 28:54.565
Why don't you keep
smirking at me?
I like that.

29:02.466 --> 29:03.615
I'm the rat.

29:06.061 --> 29:07.486
Sergeant O'Brien
has nothing to do with it.

29:07.562 --> 29:08.662
I'm working alone.

29:09.731 --> 29:11.039
And I'm wearing a wire.

29:12.918 --> 29:14.501
And it's in my shorts.

29:16.146 --> 29:18.046
(gate rattling)

29:19.483 --> 29:21.592
They kicked me out of the club.

29:21.668 --> 29:23.510
They made me leave with him.

29:26.581 --> 29:28.340
GABRIEL:
Okay, let's look
at what we know.

29:28.416 --> 29:30.434
GRIER:
They all homesteaded
in different parts of the city.

29:30.585 --> 29:31.660
That's a wash.

29:31.678 --> 29:33.253
GABRIEL:
They used different shelters.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.330
No connecting social workers.

29:35.332 --> 29:36.589
GRIER:
No mutual friend groups.

29:36.609 --> 29:39.276
Where's the common thread?

29:39.427 --> 29:41.261
They're all diagnosed
with a mental disorder.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.005
GRIER:
That's probably why
they were on the streets

29:43.023 --> 29:44.156
in the first place.

29:45.676 --> 29:47.451
They all took various medication
for their illness.

29:47.602 --> 29:48.619
GRIER
I already went down that road,

29:48.770 --> 29:50.012
but they all went
to different clinics,

29:50.030 --> 29:52.456
had different doctors.

29:52.607 --> 29:54.583
They all went
to the same pharmacy.

29:59.799 --> 30:00.756
(door dings)

30:02.543 --> 30:04.951
WOMAN:
Darryl? I didn't think
you worked today.

30:04.970 --> 30:06.545
Uh, just forgot something.

30:06.697 --> 30:08.864
I'll only be a sec.

30:08.882 --> 30:10.456
Is that Mrs. Weaver?

30:10.534 --> 30:14.036
Remind her she can't take
a decongestant with her Vyvanse.

30:14.054 --> 30:15.729
Okay, I will. Thanks.

30:23.471 --> 30:27.157

30:50.850 --> 30:52.349
TRUDIE:
Where is that boy?

30:52.426 --> 30:55.978
Something tells me he stopped
for a treat on the way home.

30:58.932 --> 31:02.025
Can I offer you some hot cocoa
while we wait?

31:03.178 --> 31:04.862
No, thank you.

31:05.013 --> 31:06.346
So well-mannered.

31:06.423 --> 31:09.182
You must be
your mother's prize.

31:09.259 --> 31:11.535
Well, I'm going to have some.

31:11.612 --> 31:14.779
-(refrigerator door opens)
-I use real whole milk.

31:14.932 --> 31:16.098
That's the secret.

31:16.100 --> 31:17.933
You'll change your mind.

31:17.935 --> 31:20.711
I think I'll steal
some of my own cookies, too.

31:20.787 --> 31:21.786
Don't tell.

31:21.863 --> 31:23.455
(siren beeps)

31:23.531 --> 31:26.066
I do wish your friends
outside would leave.

31:26.126 --> 31:27.759
They'll upset Darryl.

Is TK still out there?

Oh, no, honey.

31:36.395 --> 31:37.519

(door dings)

32:41.535 --> 32:43.018
-Howdy.
-Hi.

32:43.036 --> 32:44.686
Gabriel Reyes,
Texas Rangers.

32:44.705 --> 32:46.521
I need to ask you some questions
about some prescriptions

32:46.540 --> 32:47.947
that were filled
through your pharmacy.

32:47.967 --> 32:49.299
Oh, I really can't divulge

32:49.451 --> 32:51.151
anyone's medical information.

32:51.228 --> 32:52.210
Not without a warrant.

32:52.362 --> 32:53.786
Well, I'm not interested
in the medications.

32:53.806 --> 32:55.639
I'm interested
in the pharmacist.

32:55.790 --> 32:57.882
Can you give me the name
of the person who filled these?

32:57.959 --> 32:59.175
Uh, yeah.

32:59.328 --> 33:00.310
You see this code here?

33:00.462 --> 33:02.312
That's the pharmacist's ID.

33:02.464 --> 33:06.525
Uh, looks like those were
all filled by the same person.

33:09.137 --> 33:09.894
Darryl Keyes.

33:09.971 --> 33:11.229
Is he working now?

33:11.381 --> 33:14.883
Uh, no, but he was just here.
You just missed him.

33:14.885 --> 33:16.159
Do you know which way
he was headed?

33:16.311 --> 33:18.053
No. But he was riding a bike,

33:18.055 --> 33:19.413
which I thought was weird.

33:20.390 --> 33:21.389
Because he just
dumped the car.

33:21.408 --> 33:23.542
We're gonna need
his address, please.

33:28.899 --> 33:29.965
Trudie...

33:30.734 --> 33:32.009
you have to let me go.

33:40.927 --> 33:43.562
I can't. (sobs)

33:44.081 --> 33:45.338
I'm sorry.

33:45.415 --> 33:48.250
I have to protect my son.

33:48.252 --> 33:51.153
CARLOS:
<i> Your son is a monster.</i>

33:53.532 --> 33:55.515
TRUDIE:<i> I know.</i>

33:55.534 --> 33:58.851
<i> But a mother's love</i>
<i> is unconditional.</i>

33:58.929 --> 33:59.745
CARLOS:<i> Trudie.</i>

34:00.855 --> 34:02.164
This isn't love.

34:03.450 --> 34:05.584
It's all I have.

34:06.937 --> 34:08.027
(Trudie sobs)

34:08.105 --> 34:10.881
<i> He wasn't always</i>
<i> like this, you know.</i>

34:11.717 --> 34:14.593
Darryl was a very sweet child.

34:15.629 --> 34:18.129
I think it was...

34:18.206 --> 34:22.559
the accident with his hand
that changed him.

34:25.639 --> 34:29.941
<i> After that, he was</i>
<i> so self-conscious.</i>

34:30.477 --> 34:31.526
<i> He still is.</i>

34:32.905 --> 34:34.196
I blame myself.

34:36.983 --> 34:38.408
What happened?

34:39.912 --> 34:42.562
It was around the time
his father left us.

34:42.581 --> 34:44.581
Darryl was only ten.

34:44.732 --> 34:46.541
His father did that to him?

34:47.735 --> 34:49.586
Darryl did it to himself.

34:50.923 --> 34:53.331
Swimming pool chemicals.

34:53.483 --> 34:56.576
The acid that eats the algae?

34:56.670 --> 35:00.680
<i> I'm not sure why he had it.</i>
<i> We never had a pool.</i>

35:02.326 --> 35:04.843
<i> Darryl was experimenting.</i>

35:04.995 --> 35:06.678
<i> Dissolving something.</i>

35:06.772 --> 35:09.106
You know how boys are.

35:10.500 --> 35:12.692
And he spilled it on himself.

35:14.929 --> 35:16.688
But...

35:16.840 --> 35:20.450
what made it all so... awful...

35:22.179 --> 35:26.498
he told the social worker
that I had done it to him.

35:27.851 --> 35:29.200
Can you imagine?

35:29.353 --> 35:31.795
He was hoping they'd
remove him from my custody.

35:31.946 --> 35:34.297
He really wanted to
go live with his father.

35:34.449 --> 35:36.983
But his father didn't want him.

35:37.060 --> 35:38.593
But you did.

35:41.974 --> 35:43.723
A mother's best friend...

35:45.385 --> 35:46.726
is her son.

35:52.300 --> 35:54.058
Trudie.

35:54.211 --> 35:56.394
Killing me
won't protect your son.

35:56.546 --> 35:58.321
And it won't
make him love you.

35:58.398 --> 36:00.323
And that's not your fault.

36:00.475 --> 36:02.659
I just don't think
he's capable of it.

36:04.312 --> 36:05.978
I'll bet you love your mother.

36:05.998 --> 36:07.414
With all my heart.

36:08.892 --> 36:09.958
That's good.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.485
That's right.

36:12.487 --> 36:14.462
A boy should love his mother.

36:15.565 --> 36:17.415
And what about TK?

36:17.492 --> 36:19.843
Do he and his mother get along?

36:21.087 --> 36:24.330
No son loved his mother
more than TK loved Gwyn.

36:24.349 --> 36:25.348
Oh.

36:25.500 --> 36:28.351
Did that sweet boy
lose his mother?

36:28.503 --> 36:32.004
-Last year.
-That's so sad.

36:32.024 --> 36:33.857
She won't be at the wedding.

36:34.008 --> 36:37.360
No, I think she will be.

36:37.512 --> 36:41.089
Sometimes I feel
all the love she had for him?

36:41.107 --> 36:43.516
She's sending it through me.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.620
Otherwise, I don't know
where all this love comes from.

36:57.549 --> 36:59.290
We've gotta get you
out of here.

37:00.385 --> 37:02.886
Darryl, he's gonna be
very angry with me,

37:02.963 --> 37:04.796
but when isn't he?

37:04.948 --> 37:07.057
(groans) Ah!

37:10.303 --> 37:11.228
Thank you.

37:13.974 --> 37:15.623
(groans) Ow.

37:15.625 --> 37:18.068
Ma! What the hell?

37:19.963 --> 37:21.446
(groans, screams)

37:22.132 --> 37:24.074
(grunting)

37:29.322 --> 37:30.205
(groans)

37:33.252 --> 37:34.960
(groans)

37:35.495 --> 37:38.129
(grunting)

37:44.596 --> 37:46.096
(groans)

37:46.172 --> 37:47.222
(Carlos winces)

37:49.434 --> 37:51.142
He's my son.

38:05.284 --> 38:07.099
-Stay down!
-(Trudy gasps)

38:07.119 --> 38:08.510
Get over there now!
Now!

38:08.528 --> 38:10.194
TK: Carlos! Hey.

38:10.347 --> 38:12.347
-CARLOS (weakly): TK...
-TK: Oh God.

38:12.365 --> 38:14.106
Carlos, please stay with me.

38:14.184 --> 38:15.517
(distorted)
Carlos, stay with me.

38:15.519 --> 38:17.352
Carlos, stay with me, baby.
Come on.

38:17.370 --> 38:18.812
-Come on.
-TK: Stay with me.

38:18.888 --> 38:20.797
TK...

38:20.948 --> 38:23.191
Morphine. How much
was in the syringe?

38:23.193 --> 38:24.709
-All of it.
-Oh God.

38:24.861 --> 38:26.044
Hey, Carlos.

38:26.196 --> 38:27.953
I lost his pulse.
I don't have my gear.

38:27.973 --> 38:29.639
(yells):
Where's backup?

38:33.795 --> 38:35.386
Dispatch, we have
an officer down.

38:35.480 --> 38:36.462
Where's that backup?

38:36.481 --> 38:37.722
Closest unit
with a Narcan pack. Now!

38:37.874 --> 38:40.875
Can't let his heart stop.
(rhythmic exhaling)

38:40.894 --> 38:42.068
GABRIEL:
Come on,<i> mijo.</i>

38:47.141 --> 38:49.075
TK: (echoing)
Come on, baby, come on.

39:00.230 --> 39:02.130
(mouths)
Come on, baby.

39:03.400 --> 39:04.466
Carlos!

39:06.069 --> 39:07.969
(inaudible)

39:11.350 --> 39:12.599
Give me!

39:24.938 --> 39:26.421
(gasps)

39:26.423 --> 39:28.531
-(screams) Get off me!
-TK: Hey. Hey.

39:30.685 --> 39:31.776
-(panting)
-It's okay.

39:31.928 --> 39:33.661
It's alright. It's okay.

39:35.040 --> 39:37.523
-It's okay. It's okay.
-GABRIEL: You're okay, son.

39:37.542 --> 39:39.626
You're okay. It's okay.

39:51.631 --> 39:52.447
You talk to Mom?

39:52.540 --> 39:53.890
She's already at the hospital

39:54.083 --> 39:55.116
decorating your room.

39:55.118 --> 39:56.208
Iris is helping.

39:56.228 --> 39:58.210
This is ridiculous.
Dad, I--

39:58.304 --> 39:59.896
I don't need to go
to the hospital.

40:00.047 --> 40:00.955
TK:
Are you out of your mind?

40:00.957 --> 40:02.190
You just died.

40:03.476 --> 40:04.609
Look who's talking.

40:05.737 --> 40:07.962
Hey, thank you
for saving my life.

40:07.964 --> 40:09.464
TK:
Oh, baby, you saved
your own life.

40:09.466 --> 40:12.158
I was just holding on to it
for a little while.

40:14.562 --> 40:15.745
It's yours.

40:20.234 --> 40:22.067
Alright.
Take him up.

40:22.145 --> 40:23.586
-Ready?
-Yep.

40:28.126 --> 40:29.984
He's lucky to have you.

40:29.986 --> 40:31.653
Hey, you, too.

40:31.671 --> 40:32.912
You gonna ride with him?

40:32.931 --> 40:34.656
Yeah. I thought I would.

40:34.658 --> 40:36.724
-I'll see you over there.
-See you, Dad.

40:47.837 --> 40:48.670
(line beeps)

40:48.930 --> 40:50.613
AUTOMATED VOICE:
<i> The mailbox is full.</i>

40:52.025 --> 40:53.491
Seriously?

41:05.797 --> 41:07.038
(sighs)

41:07.040 --> 41:08.465
How was the briefing?

41:09.301 --> 41:10.374
Not brief.

41:10.527 --> 41:11.709
Assume they wanna see me now?

41:11.845 --> 41:14.378
They actually said they
never wanna see you again.

41:14.455 --> 41:15.138
(scoffs) Okay.

41:15.289 --> 41:16.864
And they strongly suggested

41:16.883 --> 41:19.200
we don't talk about this
to anybody.

41:19.202 --> 41:20.718
So they want us to go
back on the front lines

41:20.720 --> 41:22.461
and not tell them
what might be coming down.

41:22.539 --> 41:23.813
Well, they were
fairly clear about that.

41:23.890 --> 41:26.983
And they insisted that
they've got it under control.

41:27.060 --> 41:28.133
(laughs)

41:28.195 --> 41:29.301
Why does it seem like
the other thing?

41:29.321 --> 41:31.154
It's very much
the other thing.

41:31.231 --> 41:32.714
What about your nephew?

41:32.716 --> 41:34.473
Well, they said they were
aware of the situation,

41:34.551 --> 41:36.659
said they'd look into it,
but that's all they would say.

41:36.736 --> 41:38.143
So we're completely frozen out.

41:38.163 --> 41:39.496
That's right.

41:39.647 --> 41:41.723
