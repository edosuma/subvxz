<i>"Dear Allison, I went to see you again today.</i>

00:17.480 --> 00:20.230
<i>"Guess I just had to have another look.</i>

00:20.310 --> 00:21.910
<i>"A closer look.</i>

00:22.320 --> 00:25.570
<i>"And God, you were beautiful.</i>

00:26.060 --> 00:27.730
<i>"Like an angel.</i>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.240
<i>"You really are.</i>

00:29.640 --> 00:33.070
<i>"Those pictures of you in the paper don't do you justice.</i>

00:33.480 --> 00:36.659
<i>"I had to wait so long just to catch a glimpse,</i>

00:36.660 --> 00:38.800
<i>"to get this close,</i>

00:39.330 --> 00:41.050
<i>"but it was worth it.</i>

00:41.420 --> 00:43.060
<i>"Because this time,</i>

00:43.940 --> 00:46.310
<i>"I know you felt me, too.</i>

00:46.530 --> 00:50.200
<i>"Of course you would have to be this pretty,</i>

00:50.340 --> 00:54.819
<i>"because what you do, the-the things you see are so ugly,</i>

00:54.820 --> 00:56.540
<i>"are so unnatural.</i>

00:56.600 --> 00:59.189
<i>"Oh, the devil is always the prettiest girl</i>

00:59.190 --> 01:01.890
<i>"or the best-dressed man at the party.</i>

01:02.230 --> 01:05.269
<i>"There is a natural order to things.</i>

01:05.500 --> 01:07.009
<i>"It is God's pattern,</i>

01:07.010 --> 01:09.099
<i>"and you break that pattern</i>

01:09.100 --> 01:11.039
<i>"when you offer your supposed wisdom</i>

01:11.040 --> 01:14.970
<i>"which you derive from things no mortal is meant to see!</i>

01:15.840 --> 01:17.419
<i>"I read about you,</i>

01:17.420 --> 01:20.669
<i>"and wonder: do you even understand</i>

01:20.670 --> 01:23.810
<i>"what a disruption you are to the natural order?</i>

01:24.030 --> 01:25.860
<i>"Do you even know</i>

01:25.930 --> 01:28.400
<i>"that you're an instrument of evil?</i>

01:28.700 --> 01:31.949
<i>"Or does the devil exploit your stupidity and somehow</i>

01:31.950 --> 01:35.270
<i>"convince you that you are on the side of the angels,</i>

01:35.930 --> 01:37.380
<i>"when in fact,</i>

01:38.200 --> 01:41.090
<i>"you are Beelzebub, Allison Dubois.</i>

01:42.380 --> 01:43.810
<i>"And so,</i>

01:44.070 --> 01:47.760
<i>"I entreat you, devil-woman...</i>

01:47.820 --> 01:49.140
<i>"stop.</i>

01:50.410 --> 01:52.270
<i>"Stop what you're doing.</i>

01:53.030 --> 01:54.869
<i>"It can't be allowed to continue.</i>

01:54.870 --> 01:58.110
<i>"I can't let it continue.</i>

01:58.180 --> 02:00.080
<i>"You have to be stopped.</i>

02:00.240 --> 02:02.250
<i>"Please stop...</i>

02:04.560 --> 02:06.600
<i>...or I willstop you!"</i>

02:07.210 --> 02:08.110
ALLISON DUBOIS

02:58.550 --> 03:00.260
Should we keep this one?

03:01.020 --> 03:02.580
Nope. Recycle.

03:05.110 --> 03:06.240
Keep?

03:07.870 --> 03:09.549
Yes, we definitely have to keep this.

03:09.550 --> 03:11.169
This is the electric bill.

03:11.170 --> 03:12.779
Something's wrong here.

03:12.780 --> 03:14.020
What's the matter, Bridge?

03:14.320 --> 03:16.980
Where the heck are the comics in this paper?

03:17.160 --> 03:19.739
I've flipped through it twice, but they're not in here.

03:19.740 --> 03:22.940
I mean, I think someone left them out.

03:22.990 --> 03:24.349
No one left them out.

03:24.350 --> 03:25.449
There's no comics in that paper.

03:25.450 --> 03:27.380
That's not that kind of paper.

03:27.640 --> 03:29.819
What are you talking about?

03:29.820 --> 03:32.359
Every paper has to have a comic.

03:32.360 --> 03:34.750
I mean, why else would anyone read it?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.530
Ariel's right, Bridge.

03:36.600 --> 03:37.829
That's a financial paper.

03:37.830 --> 03:39.369
It doesn't have any comics in it.

03:39.370 --> 03:41.250
Nothing to make you laugh, nothing to make you smile.

03:41.550 --> 03:45.260
Nothing but bad news about stocks and 401K plans.

03:45.280 --> 03:47.769
What's a four-oh-one K plan?

03:47.770 --> 03:50.630
About half what it used to be. Hey, look at this.

03:51.490 --> 03:53.690
Your daughter's cutting stuff out of the paper again.

03:53.750 --> 03:57.139
<i>Oh, sweetie, you have to use the old newspapers for your paper dolls.</i>

03:57.140 --> 03:58.470
Sorry, Mommy.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.800
It's okay.

04:00.990 --> 04:02.130
Keep?

04:09.650 --> 04:11.220
Uh, yes, honey.

04:12.530 --> 04:15.110
Mommy needs to keep this one.

04:16.640 --> 04:19.274
"The thought of hurting you fills me with profound sorrow.

04:19.274 --> 04:20.925
"You have to be stopped.

04:20.925 --> 04:23.190
Please stop, or I will stop you!"

04:24.020 --> 04:27.340
Underline, exclamation point, exclamation point.

04:27.510 --> 04:29.160
Conveniently unsigned.

04:29.220 --> 04:30.849
Quite the fan of excessive punctuation.

04:30.850 --> 04:33.300
It came in the mail this morning to my house.

04:33.710 --> 04:36.210
How concerned should I be?

04:42.980 --> 04:47.150
This is about five years worth, and, uh...

04:48.090 --> 04:49.840
...this is one of my favorites.

04:51.190 --> 04:53.399
"Whore of Satan, don't run too far,

04:53.400 --> 04:56.070
or I will bleed you, like the pig you are"?

04:56.110 --> 04:58.070
Great. It even rhymes.

04:58.450 --> 05:00.330
I get about one of these a month.

05:00.390 --> 05:02.759
They come from the relatives of men that I sent to prison.

05:02.760 --> 05:05.929
I get them from people who dislike having a Latino district attorney.

05:05.930 --> 05:08.059
And-And from some people,

05:08.060 --> 05:11.239
I get them because they hate, just for hats sake.

05:11.240 --> 05:13.810
But at the end of the day, they all have one thing in common.

05:14.100 --> 05:15.310
What's that?

05:15.450 --> 05:17.740
None of the threats ever amounts to anything.

05:18.410 --> 05:22.540
Wait. So, you just put them in that drawer and do nothing?

05:23.430 --> 05:25.580
Actually... yes.

05:27.410 --> 05:29.030
Sorry I'm late, Terry.

05:29.410 --> 05:32.350
Oh, I called you on the spur of the moment. I understand.

05:32.590 --> 05:34.150
Don't do that.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.470
You're here to listen, not eat.

05:40.070 --> 05:41.190
You read the papers?

05:41.260 --> 05:42.690
The financial press?

05:43.610 --> 05:46.549
Uh... Uh, it's funny you should mention that.

05:46.550 --> 05:48.890
No. There's nothing funny about it.

05:51.230 --> 05:53.990
You R & D guys. Your heads are always in the future.

05:54.810 --> 05:56.569
Problem is, business is done in the here and now.

05:56.570 --> 05:58.580
It's about things you can see, hold in your hand.

05:58.580 --> 05:59.808
Things you can sell today.

05:59.808 --> 06:01.539
Not things in your head, things in your imagination.

06:01.540 --> 06:03.860
Things that don't exist yet.

06:05.730 --> 06:07.999
Anyway, if you read the papers,

06:08.000 --> 06:11.100
you know that the here and now is pretty damn bleak.

06:11.620 --> 06:15.090
And that includes the here and now at Cavanaugh Industries.

06:15.430 --> 06:17.100
How bleak is bleak?

06:18.180 --> 06:21.650
Bleak enough for me to ask you to take a hard look at your operation, Joe.

06:22.830 --> 06:25.439
Are we talking, uh, resources or-or people?

06:25.440 --> 06:27.640
I'm telling you to cut whatever's cutable.

06:30.240 --> 06:35.560
Look, Joe, without a fairly substantial cash infusion,

06:35.670 --> 06:38.089
Cavanaugh Industries is going to have to become a much leaner place.

06:38.090 --> 06:40.140
We're going to have to do 100% of the work

06:40.460 --> 06:42.910
with only half of the money and manpower.

06:43.990 --> 06:45.890
The key phrase being,

06:46.100 --> 06:48.140
"without a cash infusion."

06:49.400 --> 06:51.049
And that's why I've asked you to meet me today.

06:51.050 --> 06:54.130
I... need a favor.

06:55.640 --> 06:58.499
I'm contemplating a stock purchase.

06:58.500 --> 06:59.879
<i>A rather large</i>

06:59.880 --> 07:01.490
stock purchase.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.829
You've heard of Richter-Mullis?

07:03.830 --> 07:06.140
Yeah, that's a defense contractor, right?

07:06.900 --> 07:10.819
Rumor is, they're about to be awarded a couple of huge government contracts.

07:10.820 --> 07:13.380
I got people telling me it's a sure thing.

07:13.890 --> 07:17.540
I also got people telling me not to go near it with a ten-foot pole.

07:18.130 --> 07:19.939
It's more of a gamble than I'm accustomed to.

07:19.940 --> 07:23.450
I need some advice on which way to jump.

07:24.170 --> 07:25.879
Wow, Terry. Uh... Markets and finances--

07:25.880 --> 07:27.689
that's really not something that I know a lot about.

07:27.690 --> 07:30.480
<i>From your wife, Joe.</i>

07:32.530 --> 07:33.979
We don't have a name.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.660
Looks to be about 17.

07:35.680 --> 07:38.749
Found in an abandoned apartment building in Paradise Plains.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.749
The building owner figured her for a junkie who broke in,

07:40.750 --> 07:42.700
got high, then fell down the stairs.

07:42.790 --> 07:43.779
Apparently, it's happened before.

07:43.780 --> 07:45.729
I take it the coroner doesn't agree.

07:45.730 --> 07:46.959
No. There's no needle marks.

07:46.960 --> 07:50.570
And the bruising to her face, the trauma to the skull-- none of that's consistent with a fall.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.730
He feels pretty strongly that this girl was beaten to death.

07:53.880 --> 07:56.599
Do we have a clue as to who this girl might be? No, not yet.

07:56.600 --> 07:59.080
No reports of a missing girl matching her description.

07:59.290 --> 08:01.670
No matches on her prints or DNA...

08:18.540 --> 08:22.850
What would you say if I told you that-that I think she was gassed?

08:22.960 --> 08:24.780
I think someone subdued her

08:24.840 --> 08:28.470
using some kind of mask attached to a canister.

08:29.420 --> 08:31.219
Is there any way that... that you could test that?

08:31.220 --> 08:34.940
Is-Is it possible that she could still have some gas left in her lungs?

08:37.250 --> 08:40.960
Ariel, it's mommy. I'm heading home. Is Daddy home yet?

08:42.900 --> 08:45.459
Well, I don't know what to say. I can't make dinner till I'm home,

08:45.460 --> 08:47.110
and I'm not home yet, so...

08:48.790 --> 08:51.710
Well, listen, why don't you guys order a pizza?

08:51.910 --> 08:54.880
there's a coupon stuck on the front door of refrigerator.

08:54.940 --> 08:56.489
and then just go into Daddy's sock drawer.

08:56.490 --> 08:59.039
On the left-hand side, you can find an envelope with a bunch of money in it.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.679
But don't bother memorizing the hiding place,

09:01.680 --> 09:03.240
'cause we're gonna change it tonight.

09:06.210 --> 09:08.190
WHAT THE HELL?
(CHECK ENGINE)

09:08.710 --> 09:10.599
Honey, I've got to go.

09:10.600 --> 09:11.629
I'm gonna have to pull over the car.

09:11.630 --> 09:13.719
I'm having some kind of car trouble,

09:13.720 --> 09:15.310
so I got to call the motor club.

09:17.470 --> 09:19.830
Okay. SEE YOU SOON.

09:36.810 --> 09:40.890
Motor club. Motor club.

10:01.960 --> 10:03.799
Wow. That was lucky.

10:03.800 --> 10:05.109
I hadn't even finished dialing the motor club.

10:05.110 --> 10:06.389
I was headed back from a job

10:06.390 --> 10:08.060
when I saw your smoke signal there.

10:08.130 --> 10:09.939
I can tow you to the nearest station, if you like.

10:09.940 --> 10:12.209
You can call it in while I hook you up to the rig.

10:12.210 --> 10:14.080
That would be great. Thanks.

10:16.710 --> 10:19.100
Your call is important to us. Please hold.

10:22.240 --> 10:23.299
- Your call is important to us...
- All set.

10:23.300 --> 10:25.650
- Please hold.
- Still on hold?

10:26.740 --> 10:29.500
I'll just radio it in while we're on the way to the gas station.

10:29.760 --> 10:31.080
Here. Get on in.

10:40.100 --> 10:42.359
Uh... no, no, no, no.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.150
I think I'd rath... I'd rather not.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.530
Is something the matter, ma'am?

10:46.830 --> 10:48.189
Uh, no. No, no, no.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.139
I just, uh... I just changed my mind.

10:50.140 --> 10:54.239
Um, I-I think I'm just going to wait here till my... my husband gets here.

10:54.240 --> 10:56.240
If you wouldn't mind just, uh...

10:56.980 --> 10:59.010
just unhooking my car?

10:59.480 --> 11:01.269
Actually, that makes almost no sense.

11:01.270 --> 11:03.560
The, uh... Well, the hard part is already done.

11:03.860 --> 11:04.860
Why don't you hop in,

11:05.220 --> 11:07.019
let me drive you to the nearest gas station?

11:07.020 --> 11:09.250
You can call your husband and have him meet you there.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.219
Come on now, Miss. The faster you get in,

11:13.220 --> 11:14.469
the faster you can get your car fixed,

11:14.470 --> 11:16.350
the faster you get back to your family.

11:17.130 --> 11:18.790
My family?

11:19.260 --> 11:21.789
<i>How do... How do you even know I have a family?</i>

11:21.789 --> 11:23.387
You already talked about your husband,

11:23.387 --> 11:26.069
and I can see your child's car seat in the back of your car.

11:26.070 --> 11:27.359
Just-Just unhook my car.

11:27.360 --> 11:28.570
I'll do whatever you want,

11:28.950 --> 11:30.560
but it's a short drive to the station.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.879
The motor club'll cover it, if that's what you're worried about.

11:32.880 --> 11:35.660
Unhook my car, or I'm going to scream.

11:35.670 --> 11:36.889
- Miss, please.
- Hey! Hey!

11:36.890 --> 11:39.280
Unhook my car. Unhook my car!

11:40.590 --> 11:43.700
- HELP
- You all right?

11:44.070 --> 11:45.240
Everything all right?

11:45.320 --> 11:46.689
Yeah, we're just fine.

11:46.690 --> 11:47.869
Lady wants me to unhook her car,

11:47.870 --> 11:49.404
and that's what I'm about to do.

11:49.404 --> 11:50.677
Is that all right?

11:50.677 --> 11:51.529
Lady, are you okay?

11:51.530 --> 11:53.313
Yeah, please just stay here with me, please.

11:53.313 --> 11:54.586
-Please.
- Okay.

11:54.586 --> 11:56.890
READY SET GO! TOWING.

12:09.340 --> 12:12.829
Look, if this tow truck driver is in fact the man

12:12.830 --> 12:14.469
who wrote you those threatening letters,

12:14.470 --> 12:16.839
we're certainly not gonna have a difficult time finding him.

12:16.840 --> 12:19.379
Scanlon's on his way over to the towing company right now.

12:19.380 --> 12:23.829
But I'd be less than honest if I didn't tell you that I'm a bit skeptical.

12:23.830 --> 12:25.719
I mean, it does not make a whole lot of sense

12:25.720 --> 12:28.019
for someone who means to do you harm to

12:28.020 --> 12:31.309
come after you in a vehicle emblazoned with his name and phone number.

12:31.310 --> 12:32.679
You don't understand.

12:32.680 --> 12:34.159
I saw this man's hand.

12:34.160 --> 12:36.809
He had the exact same tattoo as the man from my dream.

12:36.810 --> 12:38.789
I even saw red ink on his fingers.

12:38.790 --> 12:41.179
Again, a lot of people have red pens.

12:41.180 --> 12:42.909
And the tattoo you're describing-- well, it...

12:42.910 --> 12:45.229
It might be uncommon, but it's hardly unique.

12:45.230 --> 12:46.319
What you're saying makes sense,

12:46.320 --> 12:47.499
and I'd love to jump on the bandwagon

12:47.500 --> 12:49.269
and tell my wife that she's got nothing to worry about,

12:49.270 --> 12:50.619
but I just got off the phone

12:50.620 --> 12:52.942
with the service station where we dropped the car off.

12:52.942 --> 12:53.900
The mechanic there

12:53.900 --> 12:56.030
said it's the water pump drive belt that's broken.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.910
Actually, he said it wasn't broken at all.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.670
It wasn't even worn out.

12:59.740 --> 13:01.680
He said it had... it had been cut.

13:02.940 --> 13:06.219
That man knew where I was parking in the municipal garage.

13:06.220 --> 13:08.249
He cut that belt.

13:08.250 --> 13:10.720
Then he followed me till my car overheated.

13:13.780 --> 13:14.749
Excuse me.

13:14.750 --> 13:15.990
We have to do something.

13:18.500 --> 13:19.640
Yeah, Lee.

13:19.680 --> 13:20.750
So, here's the thing.

13:20.770 --> 13:22.789
I contacted Ready Set Go Towing.

13:22.790 --> 13:25.379
The driver of the truck's a guy named Lucas Harvey.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.160
I'm at his place right now.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.119
So what does he have to say for himself?

13:29.120 --> 13:30.520
Not much. He's not here.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.170
But I think you're going to want to get a look at this place.

13:33.350 --> 13:34.549
Okay. I'm at Allison's.

13:34.550 --> 13:36.438
Uh, give me an address, we'll head right over.

13:36.438 --> 13:37.860
I wouldn't do that.

13:37.860 --> 13:39.349
It should really just be you alone.

13:39.350 --> 13:40.320
You sure?

13:40.490 --> 13:42.240
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.

13:49.300 --> 13:51.989
Good God Almighty.

13:51.990 --> 13:54.590
Toothbrush is gone, dresser drawers are empty.

13:54.630 --> 13:56.490
We just put an APB out on him.

13:58.610 --> 14:01.519
This is... stunning.

14:01.520 --> 14:03.560
CAN PHOENIX TRUST ALLISON DUBOIS?

14:06.410 --> 14:08.250
Well, it gets worse.

14:08.530 --> 14:11.090
He's got a little magazine rack in the bathroom.

14:11.280 --> 14:13.300
This was in there along with all the porn.

14:15.150 --> 14:16.589
He's got it all here.

14:16.590 --> 14:18.269
When school starts, when school gets out.

14:18.270 --> 14:20.500
Clubs they go to, friends' houses.

14:20.890 --> 14:23.050
Pretty complete dossier on each of the girls.

14:25.000 --> 14:26.370
Okay.

14:27.640 --> 14:30.150
I need to get back to the Dubois house, talk them through this.

14:30.550 --> 14:32.630
Get some men to follow me over.

14:33.010 --> 14:36.740
I want a detail on that house 24 hours a day until we find this lunatic.

14:37.090 --> 14:38.740
Yeah.

14:52.240 --> 14:54.639
I wouldn't rush to get dressed for school today.

14:54.640 --> 14:56.450
I think there's something going on.

15:00.570 --> 15:01.529
Hello?

15:01.530 --> 15:03.349
Joe? Is that you?

15:03.350 --> 15:05.070
Terry, hi.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.219
Uh, Terry, hold on one second.

15:08.220 --> 15:10.030
Let me get someplace, uh,

15:10.200 --> 15:12.910
private and quiet where we can talk.

15:13.030 --> 15:16.000
God, you're harder to find than a whore in church.

15:16.230 --> 15:18.279
Called your office, called your cell...

15:18.280 --> 15:19.749
Sorry, sorry, uh, it's...

15:19.750 --> 15:22.810
it's been crazy around here today.

15:22.820 --> 15:26.940
So, what's the verdict on Richter-Mullis?

15:27.090 --> 15:28.209
Uh, excuse me?

15:28.210 --> 15:30.200
What did your wife say about the stock?

15:32.530 --> 15:34.170
Joe? Did I lose you?

15:34.320 --> 15:37.269
No, I'm here. Um, Terry...

15:37.270 --> 15:40.280
I-I haven't had a chance to ask her about it yet.

15:40.610 --> 15:42.750
Like I say, it's been, um,

15:43.250 --> 15:45.320
it's been a crazy day around here.

15:45.490 --> 15:47.550
When do you think this is going to happen?

15:47.800 --> 15:48.879
Tonight.

15:48.880 --> 15:50.760
Um, I'll make sure it happens tonight.

15:57.320 --> 16:00.060
Just stopped by to see how my favorite shut-ins are doing.

16:00.360 --> 16:02.330
So, basically you have no news?

16:03.490 --> 16:08.440
No, not yet.

16:10.190 --> 16:12.189
Look, the guy's gotta eat. He's gotta get a room somewhere,

16:12.190 --> 16:13.950
he's got to make a cell phone call

16:14.010 --> 16:15.959
and soon as he does, soon as he flips that thing on,

16:15.960 --> 16:18.420
soon as he pulls out a credit card this whole thing is over.

16:19.400 --> 16:21.319
How do we know that he isn't camping out somewhere?

16:21.320 --> 16:24.239
How do we know he hasn't brought a whole bunch of food with him?

16:24.240 --> 16:28.550
How do we know he hasn't got one of those, like, disposable cell phones?

16:28.730 --> 16:29.930
We don't.

16:30.860 --> 16:32.309
I don't know, the girls have to go to school.

16:32.310 --> 16:34.259
I-I have to go to work.

16:34.260 --> 16:37.249
Joe, come on. We've all known each other for a while.

16:37.250 --> 16:40.600
You gotta believe me when I tell you we're doing everything we can to reel this guy in.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.509
I know the confinement's hard.

16:42.510 --> 16:44.829
I know having officers standing out front's not fun.

16:44.830 --> 16:49.110
But honestly, all we're trying to do here is keep everybody safe.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.840
Excuse me, I'm gonna go check on the girls.

16:56.470 --> 16:58.369
I think he's under a lot of pressure from work.

16:58.370 --> 16:59.820
Yeah, I know.

17:00.800 --> 17:03.690
I get it, I really do.

17:05.290 --> 17:06.989
You mind if I change the subject?

17:06.990 --> 17:08.480
No, I wish you would.

17:10.140 --> 17:11.878
The Medical Examiner ran some tests

17:11.880 --> 17:15.269
on that 17-year- old Jane Doe from the abandoned apartment complex.

17:15.270 --> 17:18.910
Turns out she had a chemical in her system called Isoflurane.

17:19.170 --> 17:21.099
I'm sorry, I don't know what thats.

17:21.170 --> 17:24.390
It's a knock-out gas normally used to prep patients for surgery.

17:24.550 --> 17:25.799
Which means whoever did this to her is

17:25.800 --> 17:28.620
either licensed to use this stuff or knows someone who is.

17:29.500 --> 17:32.190
A doctor, anesthesiologist, maybe.

17:34.680 --> 17:35.839
Tell Joe, uh...

17:35.840 --> 17:37.160
No, no, no, don't worry.

17:37.230 --> 17:38.820
Let me take care of Joe.

17:41.840 --> 17:43.030
Thanks.

18:04.680 --> 18:06.770
Oh, hey, Hannah wants to know if I'm going to school tomorrow.

18:12.980 --> 18:14.159
Hannah wants to know if I'm going...

18:14.160 --> 18:15.920
I don't know yet, honey, I...

18:16.110 --> 18:19.719
Well, then, uh, she wants to know then if it would be all right if, uh,

18:19.720 --> 18:23.300
she drove by the house in the morning on her way to school to see the police outside?

18:26.570 --> 18:27.410
You know what?

18:27.460 --> 18:29.530
I'll just tell her no.

18:30.680 --> 18:31.740
Okay.

18:32.010 --> 18:34.859
Honey, I'm gonna leave the door open, okay?

18:34.860 --> 18:38.690
Sweet dreams. Just call us if you need anything, okay?

18:39.180 --> 18:40.870
Okay, love you.

18:43.000 --> 18:45.049
Okay, I went absolutely nowhere today.

18:45.050 --> 18:46.489
I did absolutely nothing

18:46.490 --> 18:49.120
and yet I've never been so tired in my entire life.

18:49.420 --> 18:51.380
I need to ask you a favor.

18:54.490 --> 18:55.970
Okay, I got this off the Internet.

18:56.310 --> 18:58.290
And this is an article about them

18:59.720 --> 19:01.250
that I found in the, um,

19:02.400 --> 19:04.780
in the financial journal that I just started getting.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.500
Here, here you go.

19:08.550 --> 19:09.790
Okay.

19:11.060 --> 19:13.319
Okay, let's see.

19:13.320 --> 19:15.390
"A small company with big hopes..."

19:15.630 --> 19:18.759
And then I can't read it because there's a doll-shaped hole cut in it.

19:18.760 --> 19:20.579
Yeah. Right, I know that but you know,

19:20.580 --> 19:22.530
you can still kind of get the gist of it.

19:24.950 --> 19:29.950
All right, I'm reading. Now, I'm reading...

19:30.630 --> 19:34.120
Now I know everything that anyone who read this knows.

19:35.160 --> 19:37.720
Maybe less, 'cause I don't really understand this stuff.

19:38.320 --> 19:40.769
What's... What is the point?

19:40.770 --> 19:43.110
Well, the point is, he wants your opinion.

19:43.490 --> 19:45.709
Isn't he the man who mocked me a month ago?

19:45.710 --> 19:48.620
Yes, but he's also the man that pays me each week.

19:49.850 --> 19:51.010
Okay.

19:56.800 --> 19:58.779
You know what, honey? This is ridiculous.

19:58.780 --> 19:59.979
It doesn't work this way.

19:59.980 --> 20:01.409
I don't work this way, you know that.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.270
No, I don't know how it works.

20:03.720 --> 20:05.410
I don't know what you're going to dream about tonight.

20:05.610 --> 20:06.929
Neither do you.

20:06.930 --> 20:08.180
Who knows, maybe if you,

20:08.440 --> 20:10.220
if you look at this stuff it'll...

20:12.580 --> 20:13.429
I wouldn't get my hopes up.

20:13.430 --> 20:15.589
You know I can barely balance our checkbook.

20:15.590 --> 20:16.970
Believe me, I know.

20:17.770 --> 20:19.530
Promise you, my hopes are down.

20:40.920 --> 20:42.150
Hey...

20:43.040 --> 20:44.260
You okay?

20:46.760 --> 20:48.550
You want me to call somebody?

20:51.870 --> 20:53.850
Sir, do you think some water would help?

21:16.430 --> 21:18.290
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:18.290 --> 21:20.309
Heard you were running low on some groceries,

21:20.310 --> 21:21.699
so, I thought I'd bring over a couple of things,

21:21.700 --> 21:23.019
milk, coffee, doughnuts.

21:23.020 --> 21:24.679
Kind of a policeman's breakfast.

21:24.680 --> 21:26.110
Cool!

21:26.230 --> 21:28.199
I'm starting to think that maybe I want to be a policeman.

21:28.200 --> 21:29.870
Policewoman.

21:29.910 --> 21:32.330
There's also a couple things I'd love to fill you in on.

21:32.530 --> 21:34.910
News of this Lucas Harvey guy?

21:35.130 --> 21:36.190
I'm sorry, no.

21:36.300 --> 21:37.970
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

21:37.980 --> 21:39.319
You both should know, we, uh,

21:39.320 --> 21:42.969
we've had an all-points bulletin out on this fellow for almost 36 hours now.

21:42.970 --> 21:43.959
He is going to be found.

21:43.960 --> 21:45.289
From your lips.

21:45.290 --> 21:49.039
Oh, and by the way, there are people working on bringing you over real groceries.

21:49.040 --> 21:51.129
They should, uh, make a delive later on today.

21:51.130 --> 21:52.529
More doughnuts?

21:52.530 --> 21:54.269
No, sweetie, we got plenty of doughnuts.

21:54.270 --> 21:56.699
Hey, girls, why don't you, um, offer these gentlemen a doughnut?

21:56.700 --> 21:57.660
Sure thing.

21:58.220 --> 22:00.610
This is her; this is the woman I dreamt about.

22:00.960 --> 22:01.870
Interesting.

22:03.060 --> 22:05.220
You're dreaming a bit outside our jurisdiction, Allison.

22:05.220 --> 22:07.680
This woman was murdered last night in Scottsdale.

22:07.730 --> 22:09.670
Their coroner sent these over.

22:09.890 --> 22:11.690
Her name is Cassidy Pearson.

22:11.790 --> 22:14.699
Her body was found not an hour and a half ago

22:14.700 --> 22:16.650
underneath the bleachers at the local high school.

22:16.660 --> 22:19.220
And did the coroner test her for traces of that gas?

22:19.300 --> 22:20.360
Isoflurane?

22:20.630 --> 22:22.679
Same chemical used on our Jane Doe.

22:22.680 --> 22:23.890
You got a phone call.

22:24.260 --> 22:25.710
It's Lucas Harvey.

22:32.440 --> 22:35.159
Keep him on the line as long as you can so we can get a trace.

22:35.160 --> 22:36.610
Wait. Wait...

22:40.940 --> 22:43.579
Hello? This is Allison. This is Allison Dubois.

22:43.580 --> 22:45.789
And this is Lucas Harvey.

22:45.790 --> 22:47.900
The man of your dreams.

22:48.320 --> 22:51.960
You have dreamt about me, haven't you?

22:52.160 --> 22:54.079
That's how you knew it was me

22:54.080 --> 22:57.069
the other night by the side of the road, right?

22:57.070 --> 22:58.439
What do you want?

22:58.440 --> 23:02.289
"For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee

23:02.290 --> 23:04.139
"and thy people with pestilence;

23:04.140 --> 23:07.450
and thou shalt be cut off from the earth."

23:10.500 --> 23:12.969
Is that it? Is that what you're calling to tell me?

23:12.970 --> 23:15.829
I've been looking for you to show up at work.

23:15.830 --> 23:19.099
Looking for your little girls to show up at school.

23:19.100 --> 23:22.829
Yeah, well, I know a lot of people who have been looking for you, too.

23:22.830 --> 23:26.169
I take no pleasure in this, Mrs. Dubois.

23:26.170 --> 23:29.750
I take no pleasure in hunting down a mother and her babies.

23:30.390 --> 23:34.959
But God has a plan and there's no room in it for prophets.

23:34.960 --> 23:36.960
For seers.

23:36.960 --> 23:39.469
You toy with destiny.

23:39.470 --> 23:41.829
You mock the Almighty with your dreaming,

23:41.830 --> 23:44.769
with your second sight.

23:44.770 --> 23:46.949
Well, I'd like to believe it's God who gave it to me.

23:46.950 --> 23:50.310
I'd like to believe it's the Almighty that gave this to me.

23:50.520 --> 23:52.869
You can believe whatever you like.

23:52.870 --> 23:54.490
But you're wrong.

23:55.350 --> 23:57.530
Not that it matters.

23:57.650 --> 24:00.899
I have every confidence that you and the Almighty

24:00.900 --> 24:04.159
will be discussing it face to face in a matter of hours anyway.

24:04.160 --> 24:06.810
Really, now, who's the prophet now?

24:07.950 --> 24:09.830
Hello, hello?

24:13.520 --> 24:15.990
He was calling from a cell phone at the Arizona Center.

24:16.010 --> 24:17.309
We're still triangulating him,

24:17.310 --> 24:19.460
so, I'm assuming he's still making phone calls.

24:19.530 --> 24:23.410
Well, get as many units there as you can as quickly as you can.

24:23.760 --> 24:26.690
I'm going to hand you over to someone who can lead you right to him, hang on.

24:28.370 --> 24:29.629
I think maybe we finally caught a break.

24:29.630 --> 24:30.630
Thank you.

24:32.420 --> 24:33.169
Okay, ready.

24:33.170 --> 24:35.060
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

24:35.290 --> 24:36.930
- War!
- War!

24:39.990 --> 24:41.920
Go away, we're warring!

24:41.940 --> 24:43.100
Uh, Dad?

24:43.290 --> 24:44.849
The, uh, police guy who's monitoring the phone says

24:44.850 --> 24:46.329
that your boss keeps calling

24:46.330 --> 24:49.930
and they're trying to keep the phone lines clear in case the crazy guy calls again.

24:49.970 --> 24:53.029
So, he wanted to know, uh, do you mind if they keep giving him the busy signal

24:53.030 --> 24:56.300
and he suggested that maybe you want to call him directly from your cell?

24:58.890 --> 25:00.450
No, that's all right, I'll call him later.

25:00.940 --> 25:02.270
One, two, three!

25:03.010 --> 25:04.370
You lose!

25:17.500 --> 25:19.579
They found the cell phone that the call was made from.

25:19.580 --> 25:21.880
It was sitting on top of a Bible

25:22.200 --> 25:24.610
in the food court at the Arizona Center.

25:24.760 --> 25:27.110
But Lucas Harvey himself was long gone.

25:30.360 --> 25:32.050
That'll be your groceries.

25:35.510 --> 25:36.959
Are we expecting someone?

25:36.960 --> 25:38.140
It's groceries.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.669
Couldn't figure out if you were a paper or plastic kinda girl.

25:42.670 --> 25:44.310
Hope you don't mind, I went old school.

25:44.480 --> 25:47.489
Oh, Bridge, honey, can you show these men where the kitchen is?

25:47.490 --> 25:49.659
And you and Ariel can start putting things away?

25:49.660 --> 25:51.469
All right, that's what I call service.

25:51.470 --> 25:53.100
I wouldn't be too excited.

25:53.370 --> 25:55.090
Lucas Harvey's gone missing again.

25:55.220 --> 25:56.289
What?

25:56.290 --> 25:57.619
Found his cell phone but not him.

25:57.620 --> 25:59.449
We just have to hope that he calls again

25:59.450 --> 26:01.130
and we can pin him down sooner.

26:01.230 --> 26:03.320
Oh, my God.

26:05.270 --> 26:06.749
What if he doesn't?

26:06.750 --> 26:08.329
This guy is all about getting to Allison.

26:08.330 --> 26:09.920
There's no way he's just gonna disappear.

26:10.280 --> 26:11.059
He'll make a move.

26:11.060 --> 26:12.019
He'll call, he'll show up.

26:12.020 --> 26:13.520
We just have to be ready when he does.

26:16.010 --> 26:17.130
Does everybody hear that?

26:17.340 --> 26:18.689
What's that? Water running.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.600
I think Marie's playing with the bath again.

26:23.350 --> 26:25.850
Okay, four guys, five bucks each.

26:26.770 --> 26:28.490
Make sure I get a receipt, will ya? Thanks a lot.

26:29.730 --> 26:31.319
I thought there were five guys.

26:31.320 --> 26:32.540
There's four.

26:32.600 --> 26:33.950
Honey?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.020
It's holy water.

26:57.760 --> 26:59.030
To cleanse you with.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.270
You okay?!

27:21.510 --> 27:22.640
You hurt?!

27:31.550 --> 27:33.110
I feel so guilty.

27:33.610 --> 27:35.360
I brought him here... Me.

27:35.570 --> 27:38.209
Into our home. I exposed our whole family to him.

27:38.210 --> 27:39.850
You didn't bring him anywhere.

27:40.260 --> 27:41.870
He was crazy.

27:42.160 --> 27:43.329
Now he's dead.

27:43.330 --> 27:44.590
Still...

27:44.640 --> 27:45.969
Still what?

27:45.970 --> 27:48.470
You did not bring hihere.

27:48.660 --> 27:52.330
For what it's worth, the girls didn't actually see anything.

27:52.620 --> 27:55.920
And the person who did bring him here-- Detective Scanlon--

27:56.010 --> 27:58.189
trust me, based on the look on his face when he left,

27:58.190 --> 28:00.500
he's feeling guilty enough for everyone.

28:05.130 --> 28:08.080
What if I just stopped?

28:08.270 --> 28:09.830
Stopped what?

28:10.400 --> 28:11.819
Stopped dreaming.

28:11.820 --> 28:13.420
Stopped seeing things.

28:14.070 --> 28:15.500
I didn't know you could do that.

28:15.930 --> 28:17.170
No, you know what I mean.

28:17.790 --> 28:21.420
What if I just stopped paying attention?

28:21.920 --> 28:23.500
Stopped telling anyone.

28:23.940 --> 28:26.090
What if I just pretended it wasn't happening?

28:26.150 --> 28:28.190
I didn't know that you could do that either.

28:28.620 --> 28:30.150
Come on, let's just get some sleep.

28:30.770 --> 28:32.450
It's night; we're safe.

28:33.000 --> 28:34.780
Lucas Harvey's dead.

28:35.200 --> 28:37.470
The boogey-man has boogied on out of here.

28:39.570 --> 28:41.160
Let's get some sleep, okay?

29:11.540 --> 29:13.249
With the close of the bell on Wall Street today,

29:13.250 --> 29:16.259
last night's Presidential address about Washington's plans

29:16.260 --> 29:19.369
to fix the troubled economy seemed to calm the markets.

29:19.370 --> 29:20.960
There were even a few big winners.

29:21.200 --> 29:26.429
Riter-Mullis's stock shot up sharply on news they had won several large government contracts.

29:26.430 --> 29:30.930
The time is currently 6:10 p.m. and here's Calleigh Newsome...

29:50.550 --> 29:51.850
Excuse me?

29:52.470 --> 29:54.530
Uh, sorry to bother you.

29:54.680 --> 29:55.579
You have the time?

29:55.580 --> 29:57.870
No, sorry, not wearing a watch.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.549
2-T-H.

30:06.550 --> 30:08.300
D-O-C-1.

30:09.600 --> 30:12.580
2-T-H-D-O-C-1.

30:12.830 --> 30:14.760
2-T-H-D-O-C-1.

30:15.550 --> 30:19.150
2-T-H-D-O-C-1, 2-T-H-D-O-C-1.

30:19.950 --> 30:22.040
2-T-H-D-O-C-1.

30:23.320 --> 30:25.240
2-T-H...

30:26.170 --> 30:27.890
D-O-C-1.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.480
Hey, what are you doing?

30:30.780 --> 30:32.449
It's a little after 6:00.

30:32.450 --> 30:35.330
We don't have to get up for another 45 minutes.

30:35.440 --> 30:36.690
But I had a dream.

30:38.600 --> 30:40.050
You are amazing.

30:41.870 --> 30:45.679
Last night you swore off everything psychic and then this morning

30:45.680 --> 30:48.239
you can't get out here fast enough to write down your dreams.

30:48.240 --> 30:50.280
Hey, you think the paper's here yet?

30:50.570 --> 30:52.820
Why? Can you grab it for me?

30:58.200 --> 31:00.270
Tooth-Doc1...

31:00.520 --> 31:02.919
Hey! I think this guy's a dentist!

31:02.920 --> 31:04.739
The one who keeps gassing these girls!

31:04.740 --> 31:06.860
What, you dreamt about him giving someone a root canal?

31:06.870 --> 31:08.729
No, look at his license plate number.

31:08.730 --> 31:11.440
2-T-H-D-O-C-1.

31:11.830 --> 31:14.540
Tooth-Doc1. That's terrific.

31:14.610 --> 31:16.110
Can we go back to sleep now?

31:16.800 --> 31:19.110
Hey, the President give a speech last night?

31:19.420 --> 31:22.070
"President Addresses Economy in White House Speech."

31:22.400 --> 31:24.559
You want me to read it to you?

31:24.560 --> 31:27.020
No, no, just that he said it.

31:27.290 --> 31:28.879
Because if he said it last night

31:28.880 --> 31:30.989
that means that my dentist

31:30.990 --> 31:32.979
hasn't killed the girl I've been dreaming about.

31:32.980 --> 31:33.960
Not yet.

31:34.010 --> 31:36.580
Not until just before sundown today.

31:38.190 --> 31:41.550
Oh, that's it?

31:41.710 --> 31:43.860
Oh, no, actually,

31:43.870 --> 31:46.109
you gotta tell your boss to buy that stock.

31:46.110 --> 31:47.870
It's gonna go up today, way up.

31:48.030 --> 31:50.610
Wait, you dreamt that, too? This is in the same dream?

31:51.880 --> 31:54.980
Yeah, actually... actually, it was.

31:58.040 --> 31:59.740
Tooth-Doc1, huh?

32:00.180 --> 32:02.960
That'd explain how he had access to Isoflurane.

32:04.530 --> 32:06.780
That's him! Jeremy Crane.

32:06.870 --> 32:08.430
There's his current address.

32:08.710 --> 32:11.120
You know what? I'm gonna head over there now.

32:11.190 --> 32:12.469
With any luck he's still home.

32:12.470 --> 32:14.220
We can grab him before he leaves for work.

32:14.230 --> 32:15.599
Hey, remember, if he's not there

32:15.600 --> 32:17.329
he's gonna abduct that girl tonight

32:17.330 --> 32:19.469
from Benedict Park at sundown.

32:19.470 --> 32:21.489
Don't worry, I'll send a couple squad cars over there now.

32:21.490 --> 32:23.880
North and South entrance, we'll stake it out all day.

32:27.480 --> 32:30.240
No, I'm holding for... for Terry Cavanaugh.

32:30.560 --> 32:32.580
Yeah, Joseph Dubois.

32:37.960 --> 32:39.210
Joe?

32:39.310 --> 32:40.690
Hi, Terry.

32:40.870 --> 32:42.219
Hi, it's Joe Dubois.

32:42.220 --> 32:45.230
Um, listen, I, uh, I wanted to get back to you on that, uh...

32:46.650 --> 32:49.060
on that, uh, the Richter-Mullis stock buy.

32:49.330 --> 32:51.439
Yeah, well, you could have knocked me down with a feather,

32:51.440 --> 32:54.720
but my wife actually went ahead and she had a dream about it.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.660
She said to go ahead and buy it.

32:57.810 --> 33:00.130
But to be sure and do it today.

33:12.810 --> 33:15.890
Hey, Lee, this is like the millionth message.

33:16.120 --> 33:16.979
I'm sorry to keep bugging you

33:16.980 --> 33:19.340
but I was wondering what was happening with our dentist,

33:19.810 --> 33:21.030
Jeremy Crane?

33:22.200 --> 33:23.789
Uh, was he at home?

33:23.790 --> 33:25.069
Did you guys pick him up?

33:25.070 --> 33:26.480
Are you at the park? Uh...

33:27.030 --> 33:30.270
Can you just give me a call, please?

33:30.440 --> 33:31.639
All right, don't worry out it.

33:31.640 --> 33:33.150
I'll call you as soon as I can.

33:34.010 --> 33:36.679
Hey, what are you doing?

33:36.680 --> 33:38.160
Returning your call.

33:38.170 --> 33:39.360
In person.

33:47.160 --> 33:48.789
But this...

33:48.790 --> 33:51.689
This looks like a picture of the woman that I dreamt about.

33:51.690 --> 33:53.189
But she looks dead.

33:53.190 --> 33:54.449
That's 'cause she is dead.

33:54.450 --> 33:56.129
But how can she be dead?

33:56.130 --> 33:57.889
I-It's barely sundown.

33:57.890 --> 34:00.189
You've been staking out the park all day.

34:00.190 --> 34:01.510
Well, that explains it then.

34:03.080 --> 34:04.409
This girl was found by a security guard

34:04.410 --> 34:07.110
dumped behind a restroom at a truck stop yesterday.

34:07.470 --> 34:11.560
And did I mention this truck stop's 20 miles away from Benedict Park?

34:11.960 --> 34:12.989
But I'm confused.

34:12.989 --> 34:13.978
What about Jeremy Crane?

34:13.980 --> 34:14.969
Did you find him?

34:14.969 --> 34:15.978
Did you arrest him?

34:15.980 --> 34:17.779
Well, I spent the whole day looking for him.

34:17.780 --> 34:20.780
Finally tracked him down about an hour ago but, uh,

34:21.380 --> 34:22.576
I won't be arresting him.

34:22.576 --> 34:23.402
Why not?

34:23.402 --> 34:25.699
Cause he's in the intensive care unit at Casa Valley Hospital.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.239
Has been for the past four months.

34:27.239 --> 34:28.478
That's not possible.

34:28.480 --> 34:29.208
I saw it.

34:29.210 --> 34:32.129
I saw him in the park killing this girl tonight.

34:32.130 --> 34:33.510
You saw wrong.

34:34.790 --> 34:36.599
Jeremy Crane had a stroke four months ago.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.750
The guy hasn't taken a breath without the aid of a machine ever since.

34:39.960 --> 34:41.090
He didn't kill this woman.

34:41.330 --> 34:42.529
He didn't kill any of them.

34:42.530 --> 34:44.139
No. Yes.

34:45.489 --> 34:46.449
You made a mistake.

34:47.790 --> 34:50.440
Like I did yesterday. Letting that guy into your home.

34:52.460 --> 34:54.920
But, uh, it's okay, no o got hurt.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.880
We live to fight another day.

34:57.120 --> 34:59.350
Are we talking about yesterday or today?

34:59.580 --> 35:00.749
I'm talking about all of it.

35:00.750 --> 35:01.949
I saw him.

35:01.950 --> 35:03.470
You think you saw him.

35:04.060 --> 35:06.900
I thought I knew who I was letting in your house.

35:12.890 --> 35:14.080
Go home.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.150
That's what I'm going to do.

35:19.320 --> 35:21.630
You have kids; I have a pregnant girlfriend.

35:21.800 --> 35:23.499
I know you're sorry, you know I'm sorry.

35:23.500 --> 35:24.549
Let's leave it at that.

35:24.550 --> 35:25.689
No, no, no, you know what?

35:25.690 --> 35:26.980
I'm not sorry.

35:28.200 --> 35:30.179
I saw it; I saw him kill her.

35:30.180 --> 35:31.900
I know what I saw!

35:40.680 --> 35:43.010
You're really not going to use our bathroom?

35:43.740 --> 35:44.805
Well, not yet.

35:44.805 --> 35:45.901
Not for a while.

35:45.901 --> 35:47.019
I'm just gonna go in the girls' bedroom.

35:47.020 --> 35:48.820
I'll be quiet; I'll go in their bathroom.

35:49.520 --> 35:50.560
Okay.

35:51.928 --> 35:52.651
Hang on a sec.

35:52.651 --> 35:53.800
This is gonna be for you.

35:54.360 --> 35:55.280
Hello?

35:55.310 --> 35:56.390
Joe?

35:56.950 --> 35:57.940
Hi, Terry.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.570
Am I disturbing you?

35:59.590 --> 36:01.470
No, uh, just getting ready for bed.

36:01.770 --> 36:02.880
Where are you?

36:04.460 --> 36:06.160
Somewhere in the middle of nowhere.

36:06.950 --> 36:09.050
Halfway between heaven and earth.

36:10.150 --> 36:11.109
You all right?

36:11.110 --> 36:12.280
You been drinking?

36:14.280 --> 36:16.430
The answer is yes and yes.

36:16.900 --> 36:18.149
I'm all right.

36:18.150 --> 36:19.870
And I have been drinking.

36:21.270 --> 36:24.350
Did you happen to check the market when it closed this evening?

36:24.740 --> 36:26.470
No, why?

36:35.410 --> 36:36.670
Everything all right?

36:37.380 --> 36:38.860
What did Terry say?

36:40.970 --> 36:41.719
Uh, Richter-Mullis.

36:41.720 --> 36:43.940
He was calling about Richter-Mullis.

36:44.280 --> 36:45.450
The stocks?

36:46.490 --> 36:47.800
What about them?

36:49.370 --> 36:50.980
I guess they were up...

36:52.280 --> 36:54.140
...a little bit before lunch.

36:55.370 --> 36:57.830
And then they just fell off the face of the earth.

36:59.660 --> 37:03.090
The contracts that they were gonna get they didn't get and the, uh,

37:04.300 --> 37:07.370
contracts that they already had, I guess the government isn't gonna renew them.

37:08.690 --> 37:10.240
What does this mean?

37:11.000 --> 37:13.870
Um, I gotta start laying people off.

37:15.500 --> 37:16.970
Tomorrow.

37:18.570 --> 37:20.930
I guess the hope is that if I can lay off enough people,

37:22.860 --> 37:25.490
get my costs down enough, maybe I'll...

37:25.770 --> 37:27.360
I'll still have a company.

37:28.310 --> 37:30.560
Maybe I'll still have a job.

37:33.590 --> 37:37.120
Joe, honey, I'm so sorry.

37:38.150 --> 37:41.100
I heard it in my dream as clear as a bell.

37:41.250 --> 37:42.770
I swear.

37:43.350 --> 37:45.600
I heard it as clear as a bell.

38:10.870 --> 38:12.160
No.

38:12.770 --> 38:13.870
Please...

38:15.840 --> 38:17.230
Oh, God, please...

38:18.470 --> 38:20.630
Please, you don't have to do this.

38:23.300 --> 38:24.630
You're right, I don't.

38:26.530 --> 38:28.300
But the thing is.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.309
I want to. No...

38:31.310 --> 38:34.710
Hey! No fair.

38:35.790 --> 38:37.969
You always get to go first.

38:37.970 --> 38:39.240
I'm sorry, you're right.

38:40.110 --> 38:41.990
It's your turn to land the first blow.

38:44.310 --> 38:46.029
Go ahead, Boss, she's all yours.

38:46.030 --> 38:48.090
What the hell's going on down there?

38:48.710 --> 38:51.010
Why didn't you tell me you were having a party?

38:51.450 --> 38:52.669
Wow, I can't believe it.

38:52.670 --> 38:54.329
You were actually gonna start without me.

38:54.330 --> 38:55.829
Come on, stop your whining.

38:55.830 --> 38:57.900
You didn't actually miss anything.

38:59.500 --> 39:00.879
So, can I start this thing?

39:00.880 --> 39:02.530
You... You can't do this.

39:02.790 --> 39:04.500
I voted for you.

39:19.360 --> 39:20.970
My goodness.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.170
Your own husband...

39:25.210 --> 39:27.240
Brutalizing that woman.

39:28.110 --> 39:29.990
Aren't you going to call the police?

39:31.040 --> 39:33.430
Oh, that's right.

39:33.950 --> 39:35.599
The police were there.

39:35.600 --> 39:36.760
How do you know that?

39:37.490 --> 39:39.999
How do you know what I just dreamt?

39:40.000 --> 39:41.279
Oh, Allison,

39:41.280 --> 39:44.570
dreams don't just happen. They have to come from somewhere.

39:44.590 --> 39:46.590
They have to come from someone.

39:46.720 --> 39:50.579
And for the last little ile your dreams have been coming from me.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.669
What are you saying?

39:51.670 --> 39:53.439
The Bible is very clear.

39:53.440 --> 39:55.069
"For dreams have deceived many,

39:55.070 --> 39:57.710
and they have failed that put their trust in them."

39:57.920 --> 40:00.210
You put your trust in dreams.

40:00.410 --> 40:03.010
You offer yourself as a false prophet.

40:03.240 --> 40:07.390
So, I've been making it my business to render those dreams useless.

40:07.820 --> 40:10.039
I'm simply doing God's work.

40:10.040 --> 40:11.520
"God's work"?

40:11.590 --> 40:14.270
Why else would he have allowed me to perish?

40:14.600 --> 40:16.130
So I could be here.

40:16.420 --> 40:18.190
I could do this.

40:18.490 --> 40:22.629
So I could make you see that dentist and his license plate.

40:22.630 --> 40:23.459
That was you?

40:23.460 --> 40:24.899
Or hear about that company

40:24.900 --> 40:28.539
that was so important to your husband.

40:28.540 --> 40:30.629
People are going to lose their jobs.

40:30.630 --> 40:32.880
Everything my husband ever worked for.

40:33.030 --> 40:36.510
The Lord moves in mysterious ways.

40:37.500 --> 40:39.710
It isn't ours to question.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.670
Misery and sadness,

40:42.840 --> 40:45.570
murder, brutality,

40:45.910 --> 40:47.739
it's all part of the plan.

40:47.740 --> 40:50.290
All essential to the balance.

40:50.640 --> 40:51.990
And now,

40:52.200 --> 40:54.009
as long as I'm in your head,

40:54.010 --> 40:56.569
as long as I'm the sculptor of your dreams,

40:56.570 --> 40:59.060
that balance can be maintained.

40:59.120 --> 41:02.500
Those that are meant to die will.

41:02.880 --> 41:05.259
No Allison Dubois

41:05.260 --> 41:08.960
to foretell their untimely ends and put a stop to it.

41:10.440 --> 41:13.510
Things will be as they are meant to be.

41:15.130 --> 41:16.910
Sweet dreams...

41:17.340 --> 41:18.340
bitch!
