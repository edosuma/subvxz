WEBVTT

00:32.700 --> 00:33.900
WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:34.000 --> 00:35.200
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT."

00:35.266 --> 00:36.600
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:36.666 --> 00:37.200
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:37.266 --> 00:38.266
US.

00:38.333 --> 00:40.066
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:40.133 --> 00:41.666
AL QAIDA'S LEADER WAS KILLED BY

00:41.733 --> 00:43.100
THE U.S., KANSANS OVERWHELMINGLY

00:43.166 --> 00:44.733
PRESERVED ABORTION PROTECTIONS,

00:44.800 --> 00:47.166
AND THERE WAS A BIG SCANDAL IN

00:47.233 --> 00:48.433
THE WORLD OF SCIENCE.

00:48.500 --> 00:50.800
>> A PROMINENT FRENCH SCIENTIST

00:50.866 --> 00:53.100
IS APOLOGIZING AFTER TWEETING A

00:53.166 --> 00:55.100
PHOTO HE CLAIMED WAS THE IMAGE

00:55.166 --> 00:56.933
OF A DISTANT STAR TAKEN BY THE

00:57.000 --> 00:58.766
JAMES WEBB SPACE TELESCOPE.

00:58.833 --> 01:00.700
TURNS OUT IT WAS ACTUALLY A

01:00.766 --> 01:01.300
CLOSE UP PHOTO OF A SLICE OF

01:01.366 --> 01:03.966
CHORIZO SAUSAGE.

01:04.600 --> 01:05.333
WHAT A GREAT SCIENCE

01:05.400 --> 01:06.400
JOKE!

01:06.466 --> 01:08.800
ALSO, THIS IS PROBABLY A GOOD

01:08.866 --> 01:09.533
TIME TO TELL YOU, THAT OTHER

01:09.600 --> 01:10.666
JAMES WEBB TELESCOPE PHOTO WAS

01:10.733 --> 01:11.566
ACTUALLY JUST ONE OF THOSE OLD

01:11.633 --> 01:12.766
MOVIE THEATER CARPETS.

01:12.833 --> 01:15.500
YOU IDIOT!

01:16.133 --> 01:16.966
YOU SERIOUSLY GRAPPLED WITH THE

01:17.033 --> 01:17.933
EXISTENCE OF EXTRATERRESTRIAL

01:18.000 --> 01:19.066
LIFE OVER THAT PHOTO.

01:19.133 --> 01:20.366
WHAT A FUCKING MORON!

01:20.433 --> 01:21.466
ANYWAY, WE'RE GOING TO START

01:21.533 --> 01:23.233
TONIGHT WITH ALEX JONES.

01:23.300 --> 01:24.166
A MAN WHO BOLDLY ANSWERS THE

01:24.233 --> 01:24.800
QUESTION, "WHAT IF GRIMACE WERE

01:24.866 --> 01:27.466
A PROUD BOY?"

01:28.233 --> 01:29.033
BECAUSE JONES HAS HAD HIMSELF

01:29.100 --> 01:32.100
QUITE THE WEEK.

01:32.166 --> 01:33.366
>> JONES UNDER PRESSURE, FOUND

01:33.433 --> 01:34.833
LIABLE IN THREE SEPARATE

01:34.900 --> 01:36.900
DEFAMATION LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY

01:36.966 --> 01:38.400
THE FAMILIES OF TEN VICTIMS OF

01:38.466 --> 01:40.100
THE SANDY HOOK MASSACRE.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.633
THE JURY FOR THIS CASE

01:41.700 --> 01:43.700
DETERMINING HOW MUCH JONES MUST

01:43.766 --> 01:46.600
PAY FOR HIS LIES.

01:46.666 --> 01:50.200
>> SANDY HOOK IS A SYNTHETIC,

01:50.266 --> 01:51.466
COMPLETELY FAKE, WITH ACTORS, IN

01:51.533 --> 01:53.666
MY VIEW, MANUFACTURED.

01:53.733 --> 01:54.533
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, THOSE

01:54.600 --> 01:56.666
CLAIMS WERE DISGUSTING.

01:56.733 --> 01:57.633
BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE THAT

01:57.700 --> 01:58.933
SURPRISING, COMING FROM A GUY

01:59.000 --> 02:00.566
WHO LITERALLY NAMED HIS PLATFORM

02:00.633 --> 02:01.300
AFTER GOING TO WAR WITH

02:01.366 --> 02:03.600
INFORMATION.

02:04.266 --> 02:05.166
GUESS WHAT, ALEX?

02:05.233 --> 02:06.366
YOU FUCKED WITH INFO, AND THIS

02:06.433 --> 02:11.600
TIME, INFO FUCKING WON.

02:11.666 --> 02:15.433
NOT THAT JONES HAS PUT UP MUCH

02:15.500 --> 02:16.266
OF A FIGHT.

02:16.333 --> 02:17.233
IN FACT, JUDGES HAVE ISSUED

02:17.300 --> 02:17.866
DEFAULT JUDGMENTS AGAINST JONES

02:17.933 --> 02:18.900
IN MULTIPLE SUITS REGARDING HIS

02:18.966 --> 02:19.533
SANDY HOOK REMARKS, AFTER HE

02:19.600 --> 02:20.466
FAILED TO COMPLY WITH COURT

02:20.533 --> 02:21.466
ORDERS.

02:21.533 --> 02:22.700
SO THE TRIAL THIS WEEK WAS

02:22.766 --> 02:23.566
THE FIRST OF THREE IN WHICH THE

02:23.633 --> 02:24.600
ONLY QUESTION IS DETERMINING HOW

02:24.666 --> 02:26.166
MUCH HE'LL HAVE TO PAY.

02:26.233 --> 02:27.366
AND THE WAY HE'S HANDLED THIS

02:27.433 --> 02:28.433
TRIAL IS ALMOST A MASTER CLASS

02:28.500 --> 02:30.866
IN "WHAT NOT TO DO IN COURT."

02:32.100 --> 02:33.200
STARTING WITH THE FACT HE LIED

02:33.266 --> 02:33.900
SO MANY TIMES, THE EXASPERATED

02:38.066 --> 02:43.600
>> IT SEEMS ABSURD TO INSTRUCT

02:43.666 --> 02:45.866
YOU, AGAIN, THAT YOU MUST TELL

02:45.933 --> 02:46.933
THE TRUTH WHILE YOU TESTIFY, YET

02:47.033 --> 02:48.266
YOU MUST TELL THE

02:48.333 --> 02:49.700
TRUTH WHILE YOU TESTIFY.

02:49.766 --> 02:51.400
THIS IS NOT YOUR SHOW.

02:51.466 --> 02:52.000
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE

02:52.066 --> 02:52.933
SAID?

02:53.000 --> 02:55.133
YES OR NO?

02:55.200 --> 02:55.733
DO YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT I HAVE

02:55.800 --> 03:00.333
SAID?

03:00.400 --> 03:02.966
>> YES.

03:03.033 --> 03:03.600
I BELIEVE WHAT I SAID WAS TRUE,

03:03.666 --> 03:04.500
SO I DON'T --

03:04.566 --> 03:05.166
>> YES, YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING

03:05.233 --> 03:06.333
YOU SAY IS TRUE, BUT IT ISN'T.

03:06.400 --> 03:07.233
YOUR BELIEFS DO NOT MAKE

03:07.300 --> 03:08.066
SOMETHING TRUE.

03:08.133 --> 03:10.300
THAT IS -- THAT IS WHAT WE'RE

03:10.366 --> 03:11.633
DOING HERE!

03:11.700 --> 03:12.200
YEAH, AND YOU CAN

03:12.266 --> 03:13.133
UNDERSTAND HER FRUSTRATION

03:13.200 --> 03:13.666
THERE.

03:13.733 --> 03:14.533
WHEN IT COMES TO RULES A JUDGE

03:14.600 --> 03:15.800
DOESN'T EXPECT TO HAVE TO SPELL

03:15.866 --> 03:17.466
OUT, "DON'T LIE IN COURT" IS

03:17.533 --> 03:18.866
RIGHT UP THERE WITH "YOU HAVE TO

03:18.933 --> 03:20.533
LEAVE YOUR BEER OUTSIDE,"

03:20.600 --> 03:21.933
"IT'S NOT ADMISSIBLE EVIDENCE IF

03:22.000 --> 03:23.233
IT HAPPENED IN A DREAM," AND

03:23.300 --> 03:24.066
"WE DO NOT CELEBRATE HALLOWEEN

03:24.133 --> 03:26.666
IN HERE."

03:27.400 --> 03:32.266
BUT THAT'S NOT THE ONLY WAY

03:32.333 --> 03:33.366
THAT JONES PROVOKED THE JUDGE.

03:33.433 --> 03:33.966
BECAUSE HE'S ALSO CONTINUED TO

03:34.033 --> 03:34.633
DO HIS SHOW, ON WHICH HE

03:34.700 --> 03:35.566
HAS -- AMONG OTHER THINGS --

03:35.633 --> 03:36.500
BASELESSLY LINKED HER TO

03:36.566 --> 03:37.633
PEDOPHILIA, AND SHOWN THIS IMAGE

03:37.700 --> 03:38.833
OF HER ENGULFED IN FLAMES.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.000
HE ALSO WENT AFTER THE JURY,

03:40.066 --> 03:41.266
QUESTIONING THEIR INTELLIGENCE

03:41.333 --> 03:42.433
AND IMPLYING THAT HIS POLITICAL

03:42.500 --> 03:43.966
ENEMIES HAD HANDPICKED

03:44.033 --> 03:45.466
BLUE-COLLAR PEOPLE WHO WERE

03:45.533 --> 03:46.900
ILL-EQUIPPED TO DECIDE WHAT

03:46.966 --> 03:49.466
MONETARY DAMAGES HE MUST PAY.

03:49.533 --> 03:52.200
HE EVEN ENGAGED IN THE PETTIEST

03:53.366 --> 03:54.300
>> SPIT YOUR GUM OUT, MR JONES.

03:54.366 --> 03:55.533
>> IT'S NOT GUM.

03:55.600 --> 03:56.500
>> WELL, WHAT IS IT?

03:56.566 --> 03:58.233
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED FOOD

03:58.300 --> 03:58.766
OR GUM OF ANY KIND IN THE

03:58.833 --> 04:01.600
COURTROOM.

04:01.666 --> 04:02.233
>> I HAD MY TOOTH PULLED A WEEK

04:02.300 --> 04:04.433
AND A HALF AGO.

04:04.500 --> 04:05.033
AND I HAD SOME GAUZE IN THERE

04:05.100 --> 04:06.800
EARLIER.

04:06.866 --> 04:07.466
AND IT'S BEEN CAUSING ME TO HAVE

04:07.533 --> 04:08.700
SOME PAIN.

04:08.766 --> 04:09.433
>> SO, YOU'RE CHEWING ON YOUR

04:09.500 --> 04:10.300
GAUZE?

04:10.366 --> 04:10.866
>> WOULD YOU LIKE ME TO SHOW

04:10.933 --> 04:11.533
YOU?

04:11.600 --> 04:12.300
>> NO.

04:12.366 --> 04:13.433
>> RIGHT HERE.

04:13.500 --> 04:14.100
>> I JUST WANT YOU TO ANSWER

04:14.166 --> 04:15.266
MY QUESTION.

04:15.333 --> 04:16.133
>> I WAS MASSAGING THE HOLE IN

04:16.200 --> 04:17.100
MY MOUTH WITH MY TONGUE.

04:17.166 --> 04:18.500
I'LL SHOW YOU RIGHT HERE.

04:18.566 --> 04:19.666
>> I DON'T WANT TO SEE THE

04:19.733 --> 04:22.766
INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH.

04:23.633 --> 04:24.566
HOLY SHIT.

04:24.633 --> 04:25.333
IF YOU HEARD JUST HER SIDE OF

04:25.400 --> 04:26.366
THAT INTERACTION -- FROM "SPIT

04:26.433 --> 04:28.000
IT OUT" TO "I DON'T WANT TO SEE

04:28.066 --> 04:28.733
THE INSIDE OF YOUR MOUTH" --

04:28.800 --> 04:30.333
YOU'D ASSUME SHE WAS TALKING TO

04:30.400 --> 04:33.233
A, A SMALL CHILD, OR B, A DOG.

04:33.300 --> 04:34.400
YOU WOULD NOT GUESS SHE WAS

04:34.466 --> 04:35.800
TALKING TO PROFESSIONAL

04:35.866 --> 04:37.100
- CONSPIRACIST/
- GROWN MAN, ALEX

04:37.166 --> 04:40.233
JONES, UNTIL AT LEAST GUESS D.

04:40.300 --> 04:42.233
THAT IS PATHETIC ENOUGH BEFORE

04:42.300 --> 04:43.133
YOU LEARN, LATER THAT DAY, YOU

04:43.200 --> 04:44.533
COULD VERY CLEARLY SEE HIM

04:44.600 --> 04:45.800
TURNING AWAY FROM THE JUDGE AND

04:45.866 --> 04:47.766
PUTTING SOMETHING IN HIS MOUTH.

04:50.033 --> 04:51.500
LOOK, OBVIOUSLY, A LOT OF THIS

04:51.566 --> 04:52.166
WAS DELIBERATE SHTICK ON JONES'S

04:52.233 --> 04:53.300
PART.

04:53.366 --> 04:55.100
HE DECIDED TO MAKE THIS COURT

04:55.166 --> 04:56.400
HEARING A CIRCUS, BECAUSE HE'S

04:56.466 --> 04:57.966
IN THE CIRCUS BUSINESS.

04:58.033 --> 04:59.333
WHICH IS PARTICULARLY

04:59.400 --> 05:00.933
DESPICABLE, BECAUSE THE PARENTS

05:01.033 --> 05:02.300
OF ONE OF THE CHILDREN THAT WAS

05:02.366 --> 05:03.733
KILLED AT SANDY HOOK, WHO WERE

05:03.800 --> 05:05.033
HARASSED CONSTANTLY BY JONES'S

05:05.100 --> 05:06.866
FANS, WERE IN THAT ROOM.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.000
BUT THERE WAS ONE TWIST THAT HE

05:08.066 --> 05:09.600
MAY NOT HAVE SEEN COMING.

05:09.666 --> 05:10.866
BECAUSE ON WEDNESDAY, ONE OF THE

05:10.933 --> 05:11.966
LAWYERS FOR THE PARENTS

05:12.033 --> 05:13.266
INTRODUCED A TEXT MESSAGE FROM

05:13.333 --> 05:14.066
ALEX JONES'S PHONE, REGARDING

05:14.133 --> 05:15.933
THE SANDY HOOK SHOOTING.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.200
WHICH WAS NOTABLE, BECAUSE HE'D

05:17.266 --> 05:18.466
PREVIOUSLY TESTIFIED THAT HE'D

05:18.533 --> 05:19.466
SEARCHED HIS PHONE, AND COULD

05:19.533 --> 05:21.166
FIND NO SUCH MESSAGES.

05:21.233 --> 05:22.366
AND IT THEN EMERGED EXACTLY HOW

05:22.433 --> 05:24.366
IT HAD BEEN OBTAINED.

05:24.433 --> 05:25.500
>> DO YOU KNOW WHERE I GOT THIS?

05:25.566 --> 05:29.466
>> NO.

05:29.533 --> 05:31.933
>> MR. JONES, DID YOU KNOW THAT

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
12 DAYS AGO -- 12 DAYS AGO --

05:34.066 --> 05:37.166
YOUR ATTORNEYS MESSED UP AND

05:37.233 --> 05:39.866
SENT ME AN ENTIRE DIGITAL COPY

05:39.933 --> 05:41.700
OF YOUR ENTIRE CELL PHONE WITH

05:41.766 --> 05:43.233
EVERY TEXT MESSAGE YOU'VE SENT

05:43.300 --> 05:45.600
FOR THE PAST TWO YEARS?

05:45.666 --> 05:47.333
AND WHEN INFORMED, DID NOT TAKE

05:47.400 --> 05:48.966
ANY STEPS TO IDENTIFY IT AS

05:49.033 --> 05:51.500
PRIVILEGED OR PROTECTED IN ANY

05:51.566 --> 05:52.633
WAY, AND AS OF TWO DAYS AGO, IT

05:52.700 --> 05:53.966
FELL FREE AND CLEAR INTO MY

05:54.033 --> 05:55.900
POSSESSION, AND THAT IS HOW I

05:55.966 --> 05:56.966
KNOW YOU LIED TO ME WHEN YOU

05:57.033 --> 05:58.200
SAID YOU DIDN'T HAVE TEXT

05:58.266 --> 06:00.266
MESSAGES ABOUT SANDY HOOK.

06:00.333 --> 06:02.933
OH, SHIT!

06:04.666 --> 06:05.433
FIRST, CREDIT TO THAT LAWYER FOR

06:05.500 --> 06:06.833
HAVING THE SUPERHUMAN PATIENCE

06:06.900 --> 06:08.233
TO SIT ON THOSE TEXT MESSAGES

06:08.300 --> 06:10.066
FOR 12 WHOLE DAYS.

06:10.133 --> 06:11.300
JUST IMAGINE RECEIVING THOSE

06:11.366 --> 06:11.966
RECORDS, WITH TEXTS THAT

06:12.033 --> 06:13.133
PROBABLY SAID THINGS LIKE,

06:13.200 --> 06:14.400
"I KNOW SANDY HOOK REALLY

06:14.466 --> 06:15.800
HAPPENED, I'M JUST A GHOUL WHO

06:15.866 --> 06:16.800
WANTS TO MAKE THE WORLD SUFFER

06:16.866 --> 06:18.766
AND MAKE MONEY DOING IT."

06:18.833 --> 06:19.533
FOLLOWED IMMEDIATELY BY ONE

06:19.600 --> 06:20.666
SAYING, "CAN YOU MAKE THE FROGS

06:20.733 --> 06:22.633
LOOK GAYER IN THE GRAPHICS?"

06:26.166 --> 06:26.966
AND SAYING TO YOURSELF "WAIT,

06:27.033 --> 06:28.200
YOUR TIME WILL COME."

06:28.266 --> 06:28.933
BUT THE CONTENTS OF JONES'S

06:29.000 --> 06:29.766
PHONE COULD BECOME A PROBLEM FOR

06:29.833 --> 06:31.100
HIM.

06:31.166 --> 06:31.900
NOT ONLY HAS THE JANUARY 6th

06:31.966 --> 06:33.300
COMMITTEE ALREADY REQUESTED

06:33.366 --> 06:34.100
THOSE PHONE RECORDS, BUT THEY

06:34.166 --> 06:35.433
ALSO SHOW THAT JONES -- WHO'S

06:35.500 --> 06:36.933
TRIED TO PLEAD POVERTY IN THIS

06:37.000 --> 06:39.600
CASE -- WAS EARNING REVENUE OF

06:39.666 --> 06:41.833
AS MUCH AS $800,000 PER DAY IN

06:41.900 --> 06:44.133
RECENT YEARS FROM SALES.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.566
IN THE END, IT WAS DETERMINED

06:45.633 --> 06:47.533
THAT HAS TO PAY $4 MILLION IN

06:47.600 --> 06:48.533
COMPENSATORY DAMAGES -- BUT, AS

06:48.600 --> 06:54.833
WE NOW KNOW, THAT COULD BE A

06:54.900 --> 06:58.966
WEEK'S WORK FOR HIM -- AND

06:59.033 --> 07:01.433
ANOTHER $45 MILLION IN PUNITIVE

07:01.500 --> 07:03.933
DAMAGES, THOUGH THAT'LL

07:04.000 --> 07:05.900
UNDOUBTEDLY BE THE SUBJECT OF

07:05.966 --> 07:06.500
FURTHER LITIGATION.

07:06.566 --> 07:07.166
NONE OF THIS IS GOING TO STOP

07:07.233 --> 07:07.833
HIM.

07:07.900 --> 07:08.600
THERE ARE TWO MORE TRIALS COMING

07:08.666 --> 07:09.500
UP, BUT HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO

07:09.566 --> 07:10.666
FIND WAYS TO TURN THOSE INTO A

07:10.733 --> 07:11.433
CLOWN SHOW, AND FUNDRAISE OFF

07:11.500 --> 07:12.200
THEM, TOO.

07:12.266 --> 07:12.966
BUT AT THE VERY LEAST, THIS

07:13.033 --> 07:13.600
PHONE THING COULD MAKE HIS LIFE

07:13.666 --> 07:14.233
MUCH MORE DIFFICULT, AND FOR A

07:14.300 --> 07:15.033
WHILE.

07:15.100 --> 07:16.000
AND THAT IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD

07:16.066 --> 07:16.733
ALL BE ALLOWED TO ENJOY.

07:16.800 --> 07:17.733
BECAUSE TO WAKE UP ONE MORNING

07:17.800 --> 07:18.833
AND FIND OUT THAT ALEX JONES'

07:18.900 --> 07:20.233
LAWYERS MISTAKENLY SHARED HIS

07:20.300 --> 07:20.900
CELL PHONE RECORDS IS A TRUE

07:20.966 --> 07:23.066
BLESSING.

07:23.133 --> 07:24.266
WE DON'T DESERVE THIS, BUT ONE

07:24.333 --> 07:25.400
HE DEFINITELY

07:25.466 --> 07:26.466
DOES.

07:28.100 --> 07:30.066

07:30.133 --> 07:32.266

07:38.933 --> 07:40.233

07:40.300 --> 07:43.500

07:43.566 --> 07:45.466
>> THANKS FOR TAKING MY CALL.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.100
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER, I HAVE

07:46.166 --> 07:50.100

>> WALTER, REPUBLICAN LINE.

08:01.633 --> 08:02.666
GOOD MORNING.

08:02.733 --> 08:06.266
>> WHEN THIS WHOLE CORONA THING

08:06.333 --> 08:11.166
STARTED, I HUNKERED DOWN IN MY

08:11.233 --> 08:14.266
BUNKER, I WENT AND BOUGHT ABOUT

08:14.333 --> 08:18.066
400 BOTTLES OF GOOD IRISH

WHISKEY, I LOADED UP WITH ALL

08:18.933 --> 08:19.500
THE TOP QUALITY MADURO CIGARS.

08:19.566 --> 08:20.100
I WENT TO THE SUPERMARKET AND

08:20.166 --> 08:20.700
GOT CORNED BEEF HASH AND SPAM,

08:20.766 --> 08:21.366
AND I'VE BEEN HANGING OUT IN MY

08:21.433 --> 08:22.733
BUNKER EVER SINCE.

08:22.800 --> 08:28.966
I LOVE WATCHING TV BECAUSE

08:29.033 --> 08:29.600
I'M TOO OLD TO DO EXERCISE SO I

08:29.666 --> 08:30.866
SIT AND WATCH THE BOOB TUBE.

08:30.933 --> 08:31.800

08:33.166 --> 08:33.766
ON THE LINE.

08:33.833 --> 08:34.766
I DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET, I

08:34.833 --> 08:35.333
DON'T HAVE FACEBOOK, I DON'T

08:35.400 --> 08:41.233
HAVE A CELL PHONE.

08:41.300 --> 08:42.100
WHEN I GET A LITTLE BUMMED OUT,

08:42.166 --> 08:42.733
I GO OUT AND FEED THE DUCKS.

08:42.800 --> 08:43.900
>> I AM THE PROUD OWNER OF NO

08:43.966 --> 08:47.300
INTERNET, NO CELL PHONE, I DON'T

08:47.366 --> 08:53.466
TWEET, FACEBOOK.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.100

09:06.266 --> 09:06.833

09:06.900 --> 09:07.600
REMEMBER SPAM?

09:07.666 --> 09:08.366
THE KEY IS TO OPEN IT UP AND PUT

MORE AND MORE URGENT OVER THE

09:31.300 --> 09:32.133
THE LONGER WE LET IT CONTINUE,

09:32.200 --> 09:32.900
THE HARDER IT'LL BE TO STOP.

09:32.966 --> 09:33.500
SORRY, DID I SAY LEA MICHELE'S

09:36.166 --> 09:39.733
MONKEYPOX HAS COME AS AN

09:39.800 --> 09:40.300
UNPLEASANT SURPRISE, AND IS

09:40.366 --> 09:40.900
BECOMING INCREASINGLY HARD TO

09:40.966 --> 09:42.300
STOP.

09:42.366 --> 09:42.933
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS, YOU

09:43.000 --> 09:43.800
MAY HAVE NOTICED MONKEYPOX BEING

09:43.866 --> 09:44.433
DISCUSSED WITH AN INCREASING

09:44.500 --> 09:45.333
SENSE OF ALARM.

>> THERE ARE NOW DOZENS OF

09:46.466 --> 09:47.033
CONFIRMED CASES OF MONKEYPOX IN

THE UNITED STATES.

09:48.033 --> 09:49.700
>> HUNDREDS OF CONFIRMED

09:49.766 --> 09:53.533
MONKEYPOX CASES IN THE U.S.

09:53.600 --> 09:56.766
>> U.S. CASES SKYROCKET FROM

09:56.833 --> 09:57.433
1,400 LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO TO

09:57.500 --> 09:58.300
NEARLY 3,000 TODAY.

09:58.366 --> 09:59.266
>> THE CDC NOW REPORTING MORE

10:05.400 --> 10:06.400
REPORTED.

10:06.466 --> 10:09.300
>> CURRENTLY, THE U.S. LEADS THE

10:09.366 --> 10:15.500
WORLD IN CASE COUNT, WITH OVER

10:15.566 --> 10:16.133
7,000.

10:16.200 --> 10:16.833
YEAH, MONKEYPOX CASES

10:16.900 --> 10:17.800
ARE RISING SHARPLY.

10:17.866 --> 10:19.066
AND THAT'S THE ABSOLUTE WORST

10:19.133 --> 10:21.633
COLLECTION OF WORDS YOU'RE GOING

10:21.700 --> 10:22.566
TO HEAR THIS SUMMER, ASIDE FROM

10:22.633 --> 10:23.633
MAYBE "50 YEAR-OLD DANE COOK

10:23.700 --> 10:24.966
ENGAGED TO LONGTIME 23 YEAR-OLD

10:25.033 --> 10:25.666
GIRLFRIEND."

10:25.733 --> 10:26.366
ALTHOUGH THAT'S NOT ACTUALLY

10:26.433 --> 10:27.766
FAIR.

10:27.833 --> 10:28.866
IT'S NOT THAT BIG OF AN AGE

10:28.933 --> 10:29.766
DIFFERENCE, THEY'RE JUST AN

10:29.833 --> 10:31.000
ENTIRE TIMOTHEE CHALAMET APART.

10:31.066 --> 10:31.833
MATH IS FUN!

10:31.900 --> 10:32.600
BUT THE SPREAD OF MONKEYPOX IS

10:32.666 --> 10:33.800
GENUINELY ALARMING.

10:33.866 --> 10:35.100
ITS MOST OBVIOUS SYMPTOM IS SKIN

10:35.166 --> 10:38.233
LESIONS, WHICH CAN IN SEVERE

10:38.300 --> 10:42.900
CASES BE EXTREMELY PAINFUL, AND

10:42.966 --> 10:43.833
WHILE THE PAIN IS NOT REMOTELY

10:43.900 --> 10:44.466
FUNNY, PEOPLE HAVE BEEN GETTING

10:44.533 --> 10:45.433
VERY CREATIVE IN HOW THEY

10:45.500 --> 10:46.266
DESCRIBE IT.

10:46.333 --> 10:47.300
>> I HAD BETWEEN 6 AND 800

10:47.366 --> 10:49.566
LESIONS.

10:49.633 --> 10:52.533
IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE TAKING A

10:52.600 --> 10:53.133
HOLE PUNCHER ALL OVER MY BODY,

10:53.200 --> 10:54.566
RIGHT UNDER MY SKIN.

10:54.633 --> 10:57.166
>> IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY TAKES A

10:57.233 --> 11:00.233
DULL KNIFE THAT IS SEARINGLY HOT

11:00.300 --> 11:01.300
AND IS CUTTING INSIDE OF YOU AND

11:01.366 --> 11:02.333
THEN USES A TOOTHBRUSH

11:02.400 --> 11:04.000
AFTERWARDS AND BRUSHES IT.

11:04.066 --> 11:05.166
>> ANY TIME IT GRAZES SOMETHING

11:05.233 --> 11:06.000
OR TOUCHES SOMETHING, IT

11:06.066 --> 11:07.300
LITERALLY FEELS LIKE SOMEONE'S

11:07.366 --> 11:07.900
TAKING A POTATO PEELER TO YOUR

11:08.000 --> 11:08.933
SKIN.

11:09.000 --> 11:09.566
>> IT'S LIKE SITTING ON SHARDS

11:09.633 --> 11:11.700
OF GLASS.

11:11.766 --> 11:12.233
AND I HOPE THAT'S PG-RATED

11:12.300 --> 11:21.966
ENOUGH.

11:22.033 --> 11:22.966
THAT SOUNDS REALLY BAD.

11:23.033 --> 11:24.000
AND THIS ISN'T THE POINT, BUT

11:24.066 --> 11:24.600
"SITTING ON SHARDS OF GLASS,"

11:24.666 --> 11:25.166
WHILE NOT ENTIRELY GRAPHIC,

11:25.233 --> 11:25.900
ISN'T EXACTLY PG EITHER.

11:25.966 --> 11:27.066
IF YOU TOOK YOUR KIDS TO SEE

11:27.133 --> 11:28.500
RISE OF GRU" AND THE

11:28.566 --> 11:30.733
FIRST TEN MINUTES WAS THE YELLOW

11:30.800 --> 11:31.466
THUMBS PLOPPING THEIR ASSES ON

11:31.533 --> 11:32.400
SHARDS OF GLASS, YOU'D RACE YOUR

11:32.466 --> 11:33.300
KIDS OUT OF THE THEATER

11:33.366 --> 11:34.000
IMMEDIATELY.

11:34.066 --> 11:34.666
SADLY, AS WITH COVID, THERE'S A

11:34.733 --> 11:35.666
LOT OF MISINFORMATION FLYING

11:35.733 --> 11:39.166
AROUND RIGHT NOW.

11:39.233 --> 11:39.800
ONLINE, THERE ARE THEORIES LIKE

11:39.866 --> 11:40.433
"MONKEYPOX CAN BE CAUSED BY THE

11:40.500 --> 11:41.833
COVID VACCINE."

11:41.900 --> 11:43.000
WHICH IT CAN'T.

11:43.066 --> 11:44.066
AND THAT IT ESCAPED FROM A LAB,

11:44.133 --> 11:46.233
WHICH IT DIDN'T.

11:46.300 --> 11:53.866
A SPREADING VIRUS, YET AGAIN,

11:53.933 --> 11:55.600
IS BRINGING OUT THE WORST IN

11:55.666 --> 11:57.833
PEOPLE, INCLUDING TARGETING

11:57.900 --> 11:58.633
THOSE SUSPECTED OF CARRYING IT.

11:58.700 --> 11:59.366
TAKE THIS TIKTOK VIDEO OF A

11:59.433 --> 12:00.433
WOMAN ON THE SUBWAY, WITH AN

12:00.500 --> 12:01.333
IMAGE OF A MONKEY AND A QUESTION

12:01.400 --> 12:01.933
MARK, CLEARLY IMPLYING SHE HAD

12:02.000 --> 12:02.866
MONKEYPOX.

12:02.933 --> 12:03.866
IT GOT OVER TWO MILLION VIEWS,

12:03.933 --> 12:04.700
AND WHEN THE WOMAN IN QUESTION

12:04.766 --> 12:05.466
FOUND OUT, THIS IS HOW SHE

12:06.500 --> 12:13.233
>> HI, I'M THE GIRL FROM THE

12:13.300 --> 12:14.566
VIDEO IN WHICH YOU'RE WATCHING

12:14.633 --> 12:15.433
IS ME SITTING ON THE TRAIN

12:15.500 --> 12:16.766
TALKING ON THE PHONE.

12:16.833 --> 12:17.400
THE SKIN CONDITION THAT I HAVE

12:17.466 --> 12:18.500
IS CALLED NF1, AND THE BUMPS

12:18.566 --> 12:19.466
THAT YOU SEE ARE TUMORS.

12:19.533 --> 12:20.500
THE TUMORS ARE BENIGN, BUT

12:20.566 --> 12:21.366
THEY'RE STILL ALL OVER MY SKIN

12:21.433 --> 12:22.033
AND GIVE ME A LOT OF HEALTH

12:22.100 --> 12:22.766
COMPLICATIONS, BOTH PHYSICAL AND

12:22.833 --> 12:23.800
MENTAL.

12:23.866 --> 12:24.733
YOU KNOW, I'VE COME A LONG WAY,

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
AND I LIKE ME.

12:26.866 --> 12:27.600
BUT YOU KNOW, I'M NOT THAT

12:27.666 --> 12:29.266
HEALED, AND I'M NOT ABOVE BEING

12:29.333 --> 12:30.000
VENGEFUL.

12:30.066 --> 12:31.500
YEAH, 5,000 MIDDLE

12:31.566 --> 12:32.633
FINGERS TO THE DUMB FUCK THAT

12:32.700 --> 12:34.000
THOUGHT TAKING AN UNSOLICITED

12:34.066 --> 12:35.533
VIDEO OF A COMPLETE STRANGER AND

12:35.600 --> 12:36.733
STIGMATIZING THEM FOR A MEDICAL

12:36.800 --> 12:39.933
CONDITION WAS A GOOD IDEA.

12:40.000 --> 12:40.566
THAT IS CLEARLY NOT WHAT TIKTOK

12:40.633 --> 12:41.466
IS FOR.

12:41.533 --> 12:42.466
TIKTOK IS FOR DISCOVERING YOU'VE

12:42.533 --> 12:43.733
BEEN OPENING FREEZER POPS WRONG

12:43.800 --> 12:45.600
YOUR ENTIRE LIFE.

12:45.666 --> 12:46.366
YEAH, YOU JUST SNAP IT IN THE

12:46.433 --> 12:48.066
MIDDLE!

12:48.133 --> 12:50.100
NO SCISSORS NECESSARY, MY WHOLE

12:50.166 --> 12:53.166
LIFE HAS BEEN A LIE!

12:54.700 --> 12:55.500
FRUSTRATINGLY, DESPITE THE FACT

12:55.566 --> 12:56.466
WE'RE STILL IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

12:56.533 --> 12:57.500
COVID PANDEMIC, WE SEEM TO BE

12:57.566 --> 12:58.800
REPLICATING SOME OF ITS KEY

12:58.866 --> 13:00.366
MISTAKES, FROM PERSECUTING

13:00.433 --> 13:01.400
STRANGERS TO SPREADING

13:01.466 --> 13:02.566
MISINFORMATION TO BADLY

13:02.633 --> 13:03.166
MISMANAGING THE PUBLIC-HEALTH

13:03.233 --> 13:04.966
RESPONSE.

13:05.033 --> 13:06.000
SO TONIGHT, WE THOUGHT IT'D BE

13:08.000 --> 13:09.733
WHAT IT IS, HOW WE'VE FUMBLED

13:09.800 --> 13:10.700
OUR RESPONSE TO IT, AND WHAT WE

13:10.766 --> 13:12.066
SHOULD DO GOING FORWARD.

13:12.133 --> 13:12.833
AND LET'S START WITH THE BASICS

13:12.900 --> 13:14.300
HERE.

13:14.366 --> 13:15.633
MONKEYPOX IS A POX VIRUS.

13:15.700 --> 13:17.166
IT'S PART OF THE SAME FAMILY

13:17.233 --> 13:18.233
THAT CAUSES SMALLPOX, THOUGH

13:18.300 --> 13:19.800
THANKFULLY, IT'S NOT NEARLY AS

13:19.866 --> 13:21.433
TRANSMISSIBLE OR AS FATAL.

13:21.500 --> 13:23.266
IT USUALLY PRESENTS IN HUMANS

13:23.333 --> 13:24.633
WITH FEVER, SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES,

13:24.700 --> 13:25.833
EXHAUSTION, HEADACHE, AND A

13:25.900 --> 13:28.833
RASH, THOUGH IT CAN ALSO CAUSE

13:28.900 --> 13:29.733
COMPLICATIONS LIKE BLINDNESS, IF

13:29.800 --> 13:31.100
THE LESIONS REACH YOUR EYES, AND

13:31.166 --> 13:31.833
IN RARE CASES, CAN RESULT IN

13:31.900 --> 13:33.266
DEATH.

13:33.333 --> 13:35.133
NOW, QUICK NOTE ON THE NAME.

13:35.200 --> 13:35.833
DESPITE BEING CALLED MONKEYPOX,

13:35.900 --> 13:37.000
IT DIDN'T ACTUALLY ORIGINATE IN

13:37.066 --> 13:38.200
MONKEYS.

13:38.266 --> 13:40.500
IT WAS FIRST DISCOVERED IN 1958

13:40.566 --> 13:41.900
IN MONKEYS, IN DENMARK, BUT THEY

13:41.966 --> 13:43.066
LIKELY GOT IT FROM RODENTS, WHO

13:43.133 --> 13:43.666
ARE THOUGHT TO BE THE MAIN

13:43.733 --> 13:46.100
CARRIERS.

13:46.166 --> 13:47.433
IN FACT, IT'S ENDEMIC IN RODENTS

13:47.500 --> 13:48.966
IN CENTRAL AND WEST AFRICA,

13:49.033 --> 13:50.733
WHERE THERE'VE BEEN SPORADIC

13:50.800 --> 13:52.733
OUTBREAKS FOR DECADES NOW, AND

13:52.800 --> 13:53.866
IT'S ACTUALLY BEEN TRANSMITTING

13:53.933 --> 13:54.766
BETWEEN PEOPLE CONTINUOUSLY IN

13:54.833 --> 13:55.633
NIGERIA FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS

13:55.700 --> 13:58.466
NOW.

13:58.533 --> 13:59.733
INTERESTINGLY, THE U.S. EVEN HAD

13:59.800 --> 14:01.466
ITS OWN MONKEYPOX OUTBREAK

14:01.533 --> 14:02.700
NEARLY 20 YEARS AGO, WHICH CAME

14:02.766 --> 14:03.633
ABOUT THANKS TO AN UNEXPECTED

14:03.700 --> 14:06.400
CULPRIT.

14:06.466 --> 14:07.266
>> HEALTH OFFICIALS ARE

14:07.333 --> 14:09.000
INVESTIGATING WHAT APPEARS TO BE

14:09.066 --> 14:09.933
ANOTHER CASE OF AN ANIMAL VIRUS

14:10.000 --> 14:12.700
THAT HAS JUMPED TO HUMAN BEINGS.

14:12.766 --> 14:14.000
IT'S CALLED MONKEYPOX AND IT

14:14.066 --> 14:14.900
MAY BE LINKED TO PET PRAIRIE

14:14.966 --> 14:17.366
DOGS IN THE MIDWEST.

14:17.433 --> 14:19.100
>> THE MIDWESTERN PRAIRIE DOG IS

14:19.166 --> 14:20.500
NOT A COMMON PET, BUT SOME PET

14:20.566 --> 14:22.033
STORES HAVE BEEN SELLING THEM,

14:22.100 --> 14:23.133
ALONG WITH OTHER EXOTIC ANIMALS

14:23.200 --> 14:25.800
FROM AROUND THE WORLD.

14:25.866 --> 14:27.200
AND THAT, SAY INVESTIGATORS, IS

14:27.266 --> 14:29.133
WHY 30 PEOPLE TODAY ARE

14:29.200 --> 14:31.100
SUSPECTED OF HAVING A DISEASE

14:31.166 --> 14:31.766
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN SEEN BEFORE

14:31.833 --> 14:33.533
IN THIS COUNTRY.

14:33.600 --> 14:40.466
OKAY, I HAVE ONE MAIN

14:40.533 --> 14:42.833
WHY THE

14:42.900 --> 14:44.666
FUCK ANYONE WOULD WANT TO OWN A

14:44.733 --> 14:47.100
PRAIRIE DOG?

14:47.166 --> 14:47.966
AND YOU KNOW ME -- I HAVE AN

14:48.033 --> 14:48.566
ABOUNDING LOVE FOR THE RODENT

14:48.633 --> 14:49.100
COMMUNITY.

14:49.166 --> 14:49.966
GUINEA PIGS?

14:50.033 --> 14:50.766
EXCELLENT.

14:50.833 --> 14:51.433
HAMSTERS?

14:51.500 --> 14:52.100
PERFECT.

14:52.166 --> 14:52.900
CAPYBARA?

14:52.966 --> 14:53.600
BIG, PENSIVE SWEETIE.

14:53.666 --> 14:54.366
BUT IT'S GONNA BE A HARD PASS

14:54.433 --> 14:55.133
FROM ME ON THIS LITTLE

14:55.200 --> 15:00.333
PLAGUE-RIDDEN FREDDY KRUGER.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.433
LOOK AT THOSE FUCKING HANDS!

15:01.500 --> 15:02.533
ALSO, QUICK SHOUT OUT TO THE

15:02.600 --> 15:03.266
ABSOLUTE DIPSHIT THAT CAME UP

15:03.333 --> 15:04.100
WITH THAT NAME.

15:04.166 --> 15:05.100
POUR ONE OUT FOR THE STUPIDEST

15:05.166 --> 15:05.833
FRIEND OF LAURA INGALLS WILDER,

15:05.900 --> 15:06.733
WHO SAW AN ANIMAL THAT IS,

15:06.800 --> 15:07.600
GENEROUSLY, A BIG HAMSTER THAT

15:07.666 --> 15:09.633
FUCKED A MEERKAT WITH GARDEN

15:09.700 --> 15:10.900
RAKES FOR HANDS, AND WENT "DOG,"

15:10.966 --> 15:12.133
AND IT SOMEHOW STUCK.

15:12.200 --> 15:13.100
NOW, THANKFULLY, WE MANAGED TO

15:13.166 --> 15:14.166
CONTAIN THAT PARTICULAR

15:14.233 --> 15:15.200
OUTBREAK, AND PUT A STOP TO THE

15:15.266 --> 15:16.100
SALE OF PRAIRIE DOGS BEFORE

15:16.166 --> 15:17.066
PERSON-TO-PERSON CONTACT COULD

15:17.133 --> 15:19.233
BEGIN.

15:19.300 --> 15:19.933
BUT NOW, THINGS ARE CLEARLY

15:20.000 --> 15:24.500
DIFFERENT.

15:24.566 --> 15:29.466
AND LOOK, THERE'S STILL A LOT WE

15:29.533 --> 15:30.066
DON'T KNOW, AND INFORMATION WE

15:30.133 --> 15:30.733
HAVE IS STILL VERY MUCH SUBJECT

15:30.800 --> 15:31.366
TO CHANGE.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.200
BUT AS IT STANDS, AS OF THIS

15:32.266 --> 15:32.800
TAPING, THE VAST MAJORITY OF

15:32.866 --> 15:33.600
CASES HAVE BEEN AMONG GAY AND

15:33.666 --> 15:34.366
BISEXUAL MEN AND THEIR SEXUAL

15:34.433 --> 15:35.300
NETWORKS.

15:35.366 --> 15:36.133
THE VIRUS SPREADS THROUGH

15:36.200 --> 15:37.066
SUSTAINED SKIN-TO-SKIN CONTACT.

15:37.133 --> 15:37.933
AND IT'S CURRENTLY BELIEVED TO

15:38.000 --> 15:38.833
BE SPREADING MOST COMMONLY

15:38.900 --> 15:40.900
DURING SEX.

15:40.966 --> 15:41.766
THOUGH IN RARER CASES, IT CAN

15:41.833 --> 15:42.866
SPREAD THROUGH RESPIRATORY

15:42.933 --> 15:44.233
DROPLETS DURING PROLONGED

15:44.300 --> 15:46.033
FACE-TO-FACE CONTACT, OR THROUGH

15:46.100 --> 15:47.233
BEDDING OR TOWELS USED BY

15:47.300 --> 15:49.166
SOMEONE WITH MONKEYPOX.

15:49.233 --> 15:50.666
AND THE THING IS, NOT LONG AGO,

15:50.733 --> 15:52.033
THERE WAS AN EXPECTATION THAT

15:52.100 --> 15:52.533
THIS OUTBREAK MIGHT BE

15:52.600 --> 15:54.833
CONTAINABLE.

15:54.900 --> 15:56.933
AT THE END OF MAY, WHEN THERE

15:57.000 --> 15:58.100
WERE ROUGHLY 130 CONFIRMED CASES

15:58.166 --> 16:01.533
OUTSIDE OF AFRICA, ONE W.H.O.

16:02.733 --> 16:04.133
>> THIS OUTBREAK CAN STILL BE

16:04.200 --> 16:05.666
CONTAINED, AND IT IS THE

16:05.733 --> 16:07.100
OBJECTIVE OF THE WORLD HEALTH

16:07.166 --> 16:08.966
ORGANIZATION AND MEMBER STATES

16:09.033 --> 16:09.600
TO CONTAIN THIS OUTBREAK AND TO

16:09.666 --> 16:11.400
STOP IT.

16:11.466 --> 16:17.800
YEAH, THAT SOUNDED

16:17.866 --> 16:18.900
PRETTY REASSURING, DIDN'T IT?

16:18.966 --> 16:19.733
AND I, FOR ONE, WANT TO BELIEVE

16:19.800 --> 16:25.333
THE WORDS OF THE HEAD OF THE

16:25.400 --> 16:26.566
"SMALLPOX SECRETARIAT," WHICH IS

16:26.633 --> 16:27.600
A VERY IMPRESSIVE-SOUNDING JOB,

16:27.666 --> 16:28.300
WHILE ALSO SOUNDING LIKE THE

16:28.366 --> 16:29.266
MOST DEPRESSING MOVIE SEQUEL OF

16:29.333 --> 16:31.366
ALL TIME.

16:32.266 --> 16:33.433
AND TO BE FAIR, THAT OPTIMISM

16:33.500 --> 16:33.866
WASN'T UNWARRANTED.

16:33.933 --> 16:34.833
THERE WERE MANY REASONS TO THINK

16:34.900 --> 16:35.400
THAT WE COULD, AND INDEED

16:35.466 --> 16:36.333
SHOULD, QUICKLY GET THIS UNDER

16:36.400 --> 16:37.166
CONTROL.

16:37.233 --> 16:37.966
FIRST, BECAUSE MONKEYPOX HAS

16:38.033 --> 16:38.800
BEEN AROUND FOR A WHILE, WE'RE

16:38.866 --> 16:39.566
AT LEAST SOMEWHAT FAMILIAR WITH

16:39.633 --> 16:40.800
IT.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.433
ALSO, BECAUSE IT'S SIMILAR TO

16:42.500 --> 16:44.700
SMALLPOX, THERE'S GOOD REASON TO

16:44.766 --> 16:45.566
BELIEVE THE TOOLS WE ALREADY

16:45.633 --> 16:46.600
HAVE TO FIGHT THAT, WORK ON

16:46.666 --> 16:48.066
MONKEYPOX, TOO.

16:48.133 --> 16:49.500
SO THIS WASN'T LIKE THE EARLY

16:49.566 --> 16:51.433
DAYS OF COVID, WHEN WE DIDN'T

16:51.500 --> 16:53.200
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT ANYTHING.

16:53.266 --> 16:55.133
REMEMBER MARCH 2020?

16:55.200 --> 16:57.133
WE WERE LYSOLING OUR GROCERIES

16:57.200 --> 16:59.100
LIKE THEY CAME OUT OF THE SEWER,

16:59.166 --> 17:00.833
GERALDO WAS ON TV CLAIMING YOU

17:00.900 --> 17:02.433
COULD TEST FOR COVID BY HOLDING

17:02.500 --> 17:07.466
YOUR BREATH, AND WE DID A SHOW

17:07.533 --> 17:08.800
ON THE CORONAVIRUS ON MARCH 1st,

17:08.866 --> 17:10.433
2020, IN WHICH THE MAIN ADVICE

17:10.500 --> 17:11.666
THAT WE GAVE OUR FULL, UNMASKED,

17:11.733 --> 17:12.300
STUDIO AUDIENCE WAS TO WASH

17:12.366 --> 17:13.133
THEIR HANDS.

17:13.200 --> 17:13.933
I EVEN DID A LITTLE DANCE ABOUT

17:14.000 --> 17:14.933
IT.

17:15.033 --> 17:16.600
AND WHILE I WAS CLEARLY WRONG

17:16.666 --> 17:20.133
ABOUT COVID, I WAS RIGHT ABOUT

17:20.200 --> 17:21.000
THOSE MOVES.

17:21.066 --> 17:21.933
I LOOK LIKE JULIA STILES IN

17:22.000 --> 17:23.900
"SAVE THE LAST DANCE."

17:23.966 --> 17:25.033
VERY WHITE AND UNNECESSARILY

17:25.100 --> 17:27.800
HYPED UP BY THE CROWD.

17:28.533 --> 17:29.733
BUT WITH MONKEYPOX WE WERE IN

17:29.800 --> 17:30.900
THE FORTUNATE POSITION OF HAVING

17:30.966 --> 17:31.800
PRE-EXISTING TESTS, VACCINES,

17:31.866 --> 17:33.433
AND TREATMENTS.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.033
UNFORTUNATELY, THE ROLLOUT OF

17:35.100 --> 17:35.966
EACH OF THEM HAS BEEN PAINFULLY

17:36.033 --> 17:36.900
FLAWED.

17:36.966 --> 17:39.166
AND LET'S START WITH TESTS.

17:39.233 --> 17:41.000
TESTING FOR MONKEYPOX WAS

17:41.066 --> 17:42.733
INITIALLY SILOED WITHIN THE CDC

17:42.800 --> 17:43.966
AND ITS NETWORK OF PUBLIC-HEALTH

17:44.033 --> 17:44.600
LABS, OF WHICH THERE ARE AROUND

17:44.666 --> 17:46.466
70.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.400
PEOPLE ALSO HAD TO MEET CERTAIN

17:49.466 --> 17:50.533
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA TO QUALIFY

17:50.600 --> 17:52.366
FOR TESTING, MAKING THE WHOLE

17:52.433 --> 17:55.066
PROCESS SLOW AND CUMBERSOME.

17:55.133 --> 17:56.266
AND "SLOW AND CUMBERSOME" ARE

17:56.333 --> 17:58.033
THE LAST WORDS YOU WANT TO HEAR

17:58.100 --> 17:59.366
IN THE EARLY DAYS OF A DISEASE

17:59.433 --> 18:01.266
OUTBREAK, APART FROM, OF COURSE,

18:01.333 --> 18:02.633
THE OPENING LINES OF "IMAGINE"

18:02.700 --> 18:05.566
SUNG A CAPPELLA.

18:07.500 --> 18:08.500
AS OF EARLY JUNE, WE WERE ONLY

18:08.566 --> 18:10.466
CONDUCTING TEN TESTS PER DAY, IN

18:10.533 --> 18:13.033
TOTAL, ACROSS THE COUNTRY,

18:13.100 --> 18:13.666
INCREASING TO JUST 60 BY THE END

18:13.733 --> 18:16.033
OF THE MONTH.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.233
THANKFULLY, TESTING HAS RAMPED

18:17.300 --> 18:18.966
UP SINCE THEN, WITH THE BIDEN

18:19.033 --> 18:20.400
ADMINISTRATION FINALLY ALLOWING

18:20.466 --> 18:21.900
COMMERCIAL LABS TO TEST AS WELL,

18:22.000 --> 18:22.833
BUT BARRIERS STILL VERY MUCH

18:22.900 --> 18:32.533
REMAIN.

18:32.600 --> 18:36.600
FOR ONE THING, THERE IS ONLY ONE

18:36.666 --> 18:41.600
FDA APPROVED TEST, REQUIRING YOU

18:41.666 --> 18:42.600
TO SWAB LESIONS.

18:42.666 --> 18:43.400
WHICH, ASIDE FROM BEING PAINFUL,

18:43.466 --> 18:44.166
MEANS YOU HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL

18:44.233 --> 18:44.866
THEY APPEAR TO EVEN RUN A TEST,

18:44.933 --> 18:45.866
AND THEY MAY NOT BE THE FIRST

18:45.933 --> 18:46.666
SYMPTOM.

18:46.733 --> 18:47.600
SO UNTIL WE GET NEW TESTS, LIKE

18:47.666 --> 18:48.600
THE SALIVA ONES ALREADY BEING

18:48.666 --> 18:49.333
USED IN EUROPE, OUR CASE NUMBERS

18:49.400 --> 18:50.333
ARE ALWAYS GOING TO LAG.

18:50.400 --> 18:51.133
BUT WHAT'S MORE, WE,

18:51.200 --> 18:51.966
RIDICULOUSLY, DON'T HAVE A

18:52.033 --> 18:52.900
SYSTEM FOR GATHERING AND SHARING

18:52.966 --> 18:53.966
DATA.

18:54.033 --> 18:55.100
MONKEYPOX WAS SPREADING FOR MORE

18:55.166 --> 18:56.100
THAN TWO MONTHS BEFORE STATES

18:56.166 --> 18:57.433
WERE EVEN REQUIRED TO SHARE DATA

18:57.500 --> 18:58.766
WITH THE CDC, MAKING TRACKING

18:58.833 --> 19:00.066
CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

19:00.133 --> 19:02.033
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT.

19:02.100 --> 19:03.500
AND THE TRUTH IS, EVEN

19:03.566 --> 19:05.433
COMMUNICATION WITHIN STATES CAN

19:05.500 --> 19:07.200
BE ABSURDLY ANTIQUATED.

19:07.266 --> 19:08.666
>> YOU KNOW, I TALKED TO

19:08.733 --> 19:10.266
OFFICIALS IN MISSOURI AND

19:10.333 --> 19:11.800
FLORIDA WHO ARE COUNTING

19:11.866 --> 19:13.500
MONKEYPOX CASES VIA FAX.

19:13.566 --> 19:14.666
I THINK WE ALL, IN THE UNITED

19:14.733 --> 19:15.566
STATES, KIND OF EXPECT PUBLIC

19:15.633 --> 19:16.433
HEALTH TO WORK LIKE AMAZON

19:16.500 --> 19:17.566
PRIME.

19:17.633 --> 19:18.633
YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA GET OUR

19:18.700 --> 19:19.366
PACKAGES IN TWO DAYS AND

19:19.433 --> 19:21.200
EVERYTHING WILL BE FIXED.

19:21.266 --> 19:23.266
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, YOU KNOW,

19:23.333 --> 19:24.066
PUBLIC HEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY

19:24.133 --> 19:24.733
HAS BEEN UNDERFUNDED FOR

19:24.800 --> 19:26.366
DECADES.

19:26.433 --> 19:28.000
OKAY, FIRST, THE ONLY

19:28.066 --> 19:29.333
WAY WE THINK PUBLIC HEALTH IS

19:29.400 --> 19:30.566
LIKE AMAZON PRIME IS THAT THEY

19:30.633 --> 19:31.200
BOTH FORCE PEOPLE TO PEE IN

19:31.266 --> 19:34.233
PLASTIC CONTAINERS.

19:35.233 --> 19:36.933
BUT SECOND, FAX MACHINES?

19:37.000 --> 19:38.066
THE ONLY THING FAX MACHINES

19:38.133 --> 19:39.200
SHOULD BE USED FOR NOWADAYS IS

19:39.266 --> 19:40.333
FOR ENDING THE SENTENCE, "HEY,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.733
REMEMBER FAX MACHINES?"

19:44.500 --> 19:46.600
AND THAT IS IT.

19:46.666 --> 19:47.866
SO, WE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE THE

19:47.933 --> 19:49.000
CASES WERE OR HOW MANY THERE

19:49.066 --> 19:49.866
WERE, AND WHATEVER NUMBERS WE

19:49.933 --> 19:51.200
DID HAVE WERE LIKELY DRASTIC

19:51.266 --> 19:51.933
UNDERCOUNTS, BECAUSE WE WEREN'T

19:52.000 --> 19:53.000
TESTING ENOUGH.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.933
WHICH IS ALREADY VERY BAD.

19:55.000 --> 19:56.566
THEN, THERE'S THE VACCINES.

19:56.633 --> 19:57.500
WHERE, AGAIN, WE SHOULD'VE BEEN

19:57.566 --> 19:59.466
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.000
THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S ACTUALLY

20:01.066 --> 20:02.400
BEEN DEVELOPING AND STOCKPILING

20:02.466 --> 20:04.500
NEW SMALLPOX VACCINES SINCE

20:04.566 --> 20:05.566
9/11, WHEN THERE WERE FEARS THAT

20:05.633 --> 20:07.533
IT WOULD BE USED AS A BIOWEAPON.

20:07.600 --> 20:08.633
JUST WATCH THIS SEGMENT FROM

20:08.700 --> 20:09.566
2002, WHICH FEATURES A FAMILIAR

20:09.633 --> 20:11.600
FACE.

20:11.666 --> 20:13.333
>> THE U.S. GOVERNMENT BEGAN

20:13.400 --> 20:15.466
STOCKPILING SMALLPOX VACCINE

20:15.533 --> 20:17.200
LAST YEAR AND HAS PLACED ORDERS

20:17.266 --> 20:19.966
FOR TENS OF MILLIONS MORE DOSES.

20:20.033 --> 20:21.400
>> WE HAVE ENOUGH MATERIAL THAT

20:21.466 --> 20:23.700
IF WE NEEDED TO, GOD FORBID, A

20:23.766 --> 20:25.733
CATASTROPHE OF A MASSIVE ATTACK,

20:25.800 --> 20:26.900
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE A

20:26.966 --> 20:27.733
VACCINE FOR EVERYONE IN THE

20:27.800 --> 20:28.966
COUNTRY.

20:29.033 --> 20:31.033
YEAH, THERE HE IS!

20:31.100 --> 20:32.366
ANTHONY FAUCI, THE FORREST GUMP

20:32.433 --> 20:35.366
OF CATASTROPHIC CONTAGION.

20:36.600 --> 20:38.333
BUT THE POINT IS, THE GOVERNMENT

20:38.400 --> 20:39.466
VERY SMARTLY BUILT UP MASSIVE

20:39.533 --> 20:42.466
RESERVES OF SMALLPOX VACCINE.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.666
IT IS JUST ONE OF THE ONE WAYS

20:43.733 --> 20:44.266
THAT THE WAR ON TERROR MADE US

20:44.333 --> 20:47.766
SAFER.

20:48.966 --> 20:49.733
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, THOSE HUGE

20:49.800 --> 20:50.500
STOCKPILES WEREN'T AVAILABLE AT

20:50.566 --> 20:51.500
THE START OF THIS MONKEYPOX

20:51.566 --> 20:52.333
OUTBREAK, THANKS TO A NUMBER OF

20:52.400 --> 20:53.933
KEY STRATEGIC ERRORS.

20:54.000 --> 20:56.166
FOR A START, INCREDIBLY, WE LET

20:56.233 --> 20:58.566
20 MILLION DOSES EXPIRE.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.866
WE JUST... DID THAT.

21:02.900 --> 21:03.900
WHICH SEEMS ESPECIALLY

21:03.966 --> 21:04.966
UNCONSCIONABLE GIVEN, AS I

21:05.033 --> 21:06.200
MENTIONED EARLIER, MULTIPLE

21:06.266 --> 21:07.300
AFRICAN COUNTRIES HAVE HAD

21:07.366 --> 21:08.700
OUTBREAKS OF MONKEYPOX FOR

21:08.766 --> 21:09.700
DECADES NOW, AND MIGHT'VE

21:09.766 --> 21:11.900
APPRECIATED A SHOT OR TWO.

21:11.966 --> 21:13.266
SHARING VACCINES WOULD'VE SERVED

21:13.333 --> 21:15.300
BASIC HUMAN

21:15.366 --> 21:17.366
DECENCY, BUT ALSO, ABJECT

21:17.433 --> 21:19.100
SELFISHNESS, IN THAT STOPPING

21:19.166 --> 21:20.300
OUTBREAKS OVER THERE MIGHT WELL

21:20.366 --> 21:21.766
HAVE PREVENTED THE CURRENT

21:21.833 --> 21:23.800
OUTBREAK OVER HERE.

21:23.866 --> 21:25.433
AND YET, FOR SOME REASON, WE LET

21:25.500 --> 21:27.000
THE VACCINE SIT UNUSED ON A

21:27.066 --> 21:29.366
SHELF IN OUR RESERVES LIKE

21:29.433 --> 21:31.633
AN EXPIRED CHOBANI, OR A

21:31.700 --> 21:32.566
$90 MILLION DOLLAR MOVIE ON HBO

21:32.633 --> 21:34.500
MAX.

21:35.400 --> 21:36.466
BY THE WAY -- HI THERE, NEW

21:36.533 --> 21:37.633
BUSINESS DADDY.

21:37.700 --> 21:38.300
SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE DOING A REALLY

21:38.366 --> 21:41.500
GREAT JOB!

21:42.533 --> 21:43.933
I DO GET THE VAGUE SENSE YOU'RE

21:44.000 --> 21:44.566
BURNING DOWN MY NETWORK FOR THE

21:44.633 --> 21:46.766
INSURANCE MONEY, BUT I'M SURE

21:46.833 --> 21:48.866
THAT'LL ALL PASS.

21:52.100 --> 21:53.266
SO, AT ONE TIME, WE HAD MORE

21:53.333 --> 21:53.966
THAN 20 MILLION VACCINES

21:54.033 --> 21:55.133
AVAILABLE.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.800
BUT WHEN THIS OUTBREAK BEGAN, WE

21:57.866 --> 21:59.500
WERE DOWN TO JUST 2,400 USABLE

21:59.566 --> 22:01.400
DOSES, WHICH IS ENOUGH TO FULLY

22:01.466 --> 22:04.300
VACCINATE JUST 1,200 PEOPLE.

22:04.366 --> 22:05.433
NOW, WE DID HAVE 300,000 DOSES

22:05.500 --> 22:06.566
SITTING IN A WAREHOUSE IN

22:06.633 --> 22:08.033
DENMARK, BUT FOR SOME REASON,

22:08.100 --> 22:09.666
OFFICIALS WAITED WEEKS AS THE

22:09.733 --> 22:10.900
VIRUS SPREAD, BEFORE FINALLY

22:10.966 --> 22:11.500
DECIDING TO SHIP THEM TO THE

22:11.566 --> 22:13.300
U.S.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.600
AND THAT SEQUENCE OF BAD

22:14.666 --> 22:17.200
DECISIONS IS WHY WE'VE BEEN

22:17.266 --> 22:18.400
SEEING SCENES LIKE THESE.

22:18.466 --> 22:19.866
>> HUNDREDS LINED UP FOR THE

22:19.933 --> 22:21.200
MONKEYPOX VACCINE LAST WEEK AT

22:21.266 --> 22:22.266
THIS CLINIC IN MANHATTAN, BUT

22:22.333 --> 22:24.366
SUPPLIES QUICKLY RAN OUT.

22:24.433 --> 22:25.366
>> I CAME HERE FOR LIKE A FEW

22:25.433 --> 22:25.933
DAYS ALREADY BECAUSE I DON'T

22:26.000 --> 22:27.566
HAVE APPOINTMENT.

22:27.633 --> 22:29.200
I WENT TO THE WEBSITE AND THE --

22:29.266 --> 22:30.966
THE WEBSITE CRASHED.

22:31.033 --> 22:32.366
>> BEEN TRYING TO GET A VACCINE

22:32.433 --> 22:33.033
FOR THE LAST ALMOST TWO AND A

22:33.100 --> 22:36.833
HALF, THREE WEEKS.

22:36.900 --> 22:37.600
TRIED AT MULTIPLE VACCINE

22:37.666 --> 22:38.200
CENTERS AND EVERYONE'S OUT OF

22:38.266 --> 22:39.900
VACCINES.

22:39.966 --> 22:41.500
SO HERE I AM.

22:41.566 --> 22:42.500
YEAH, VACCINES ARE

22:42.566 --> 22:43.133
APPARENTLY THE BEYONCE CONCERT

22:43.200 --> 22:43.966
TICKETS OF HEALTHCARE.

22:44.033 --> 22:44.900
ANNOUNCED WITH LITTLE WARNING,

22:44.966 --> 22:45.800
GONE IN 30 MINUTES, AND WILL

22:45.866 --> 22:47.033
LIKELY HAVE YOU SCREAMING

22:47.100 --> 22:47.866
"YOU WON'T BREAK MY SOUL" AT THE

22:47.933 --> 22:51.166
TOP OF YOUR LUNGS.

22:52.133 --> 22:52.866
SO, TESTS?

22:52.933 --> 22:54.066
HAMPERED BY RED TAPE.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.300
VACCINES?

22:55.366 --> 22:56.233
EXPIRED BY THE MILLIONS.

22:56.300 --> 22:57.366
AND FINALLY, THERE'S TREATMENTS.

22:57.433 --> 22:58.766
REMEMBER, MONKEYPOX CAN BE

22:58.833 --> 23:00.366
INCREDIBLY PAINFUL.

23:00.433 --> 23:01.600
AND THERE IS A DRUG THAT SHOWS

23:01.666 --> 23:02.133
PROMISE IN REDUCING THOSE

23:02.200 --> 23:04.233
SYMPTOMS.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.533
BUT IT, TOO, IS WAY HARDER TO

23:05.600 --> 23:07.566
GET THAN IT SHOULD BE.

23:07.633 --> 23:08.833
>> AN EXPERIMENTAL DRUG THAT

23:08.900 --> 23:10.333
COULD HELP SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE

23:10.400 --> 23:11.800
MONKEYPOX IS AVAILABLE, BUT THE

23:11.866 --> 23:13.266
QUESTION IS, CAN THEY GET IT?

23:13.333 --> 23:15.566
>> THE MEDICATION IS CALLED

23:15.633 --> 23:18.033
TECOVIRIMAT, BRAND NAME TPOXX.

23:18.100 --> 23:20.400
THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF TPOXX,

23:20.466 --> 23:21.433
BUT IT'S ONLY FDA APPROVED FOR

23:21.500 --> 23:23.366
SMALLPOX.

23:23.433 --> 23:24.366
FOR MONKEYPOX, IT'S STILL

23:24.433 --> 23:25.000
CONSIDERED AN INVESTIGATIONAL

23:25.066 --> 23:26.766
DRUG.

23:26.833 --> 23:28.466
THE CDC HAS LIFTED SOME

23:28.533 --> 23:29.833
REQUIREMENTS SO DOCTORS CAN

23:29.900 --> 23:32.233
PRESCRIBE IT UNDER SOMETHING

23:32.300 --> 23:33.400
CALLED EXPANDED ACCESS, BUT THAT

23:33.466 --> 23:34.566
INVOLVES HOURS OF FORMS AND

23:34.633 --> 23:36.233
EXTRA APPOINTMENTS.

23:36.300 --> 23:37.433
YEAH, AND EVEN IF YOU

23:37.500 --> 23:43.500
FOUND A DOCTOR WILLING TO DO ALL

23:43.566 --> 23:49.366
OF THAT, SOME PATIENTS ARE THEN

23:49.433 --> 23:50.266
FINDING THEMSELVES WAITING DAYS

23:50.333 --> 23:51.166
FOR SHIPMENTS OF THE DRUG TO

23:51.233 --> 23:51.933
ARRIVE FROM THE STRATEGIC

23:52.000 --> 23:52.666
NATIONAL STOCKPILE.

23:52.733 --> 23:53.333
WHICH JUST ISN'T GREAT,

23:53.400 --> 23:54.166
CONSIDERING, REMEMBER, THIS CAN

23:54.233 --> 23:55.333
FEEL LIKE SITTING ON SHARDS OF

23:55.400 --> 23:55.800
GLASS.

23:55.866 --> 23:56.700
IT IS NOT A CONDITION YOU CAN

23:56.766 --> 23:57.533
JUST PUT OFF DEALING WITH FOR A

23:57.600 --> 23:58.833
FEW DAYS, LIKE A COLD, OR A UTI

23:58.900 --> 24:00.200
IF YOU'RE SUPER TIRED.

24:01.966 --> 24:03.633
BASICALLY, EVERY PART OF OUR

24:03.700 --> 24:04.633
EARLY RESPONSE TO THIS MADE

24:04.700 --> 24:05.300
THINGS HARDER THAN THEY NEEDED

24:05.366 --> 24:06.500
TO BE.

24:06.566 --> 24:08.133
AND I WILL SAY, THERE HAVE BEEN

24:08.200 --> 24:09.533
SOME IMPROVEMENTS RECENTLY.

24:09.600 --> 24:10.133
WE'VE SEEN SOME PROGRESS ON

24:10.200 --> 24:11.866
TESTING.

24:11.933 --> 24:13.333
MORE VACCINES ARE FINALLY

24:13.400 --> 24:14.266
COMING, WITH LARGE NUMBERS SET

24:14.333 --> 24:16.633
TO START ARRIVING IN OCTOBER.

24:16.700 --> 24:17.666
AND THE PAPERWORK FOR TPOXX HAS

24:17.733 --> 24:20.466
BEEN STREAMLINED SOMEWHAT.

24:20.533 --> 24:21.600
SO IF YOU THINK YOU NEED ANY OF

24:21.666 --> 24:23.600
THOSE, YOU SHOULD STILL,

24:23.666 --> 24:25.133
ABSOLUTELY, BE SEEKING THEM OUT.

24:25.200 --> 24:30.100
BUT THE DELAYS WE'VE SEEN IN

24:30.166 --> 24:30.966
FIXING THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN

24:31.033 --> 24:31.833
ABSOLUTELY MADDENING.

24:31.900 --> 24:32.600
AND IT HAS BEEN HARD NOT TO

24:32.666 --> 24:33.566
WONDER WHETHER THE LACK OF

24:33.633 --> 24:34.666
URGENCY HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH

24:34.733 --> 24:35.200
WHO'S BEEN GETTING HIT THE

24:35.266 --> 24:37.066
HARDEST.

24:37.133 --> 24:37.700
>> YOU KNOW, THIS IS OBVIOUSLY

24:37.766 --> 24:39.733
SPREADING.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.300
IT'S SOMETHING THAT WARRANTS

24:40.366 --> 24:41.633
CONCERN.

24:41.700 --> 24:45.033
WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE FOR

24:45.100 --> 24:45.766
OUR COMMUNITY IS THE 1980s, HIV

24:45.833 --> 24:47.300
ALL OVER AGAIN.

24:47.366 --> 24:52.000
WHERE IT WASN'T TALKED ABOUT, IT

24:52.066 --> 24:57.433
WAS KNOWN THAT IT WAS OUT THERE

24:57.500 --> 25:01.333
BUT THERE WAS NO PRESSURE TO DO

25:01.400 --> 25:05.166
ANYTHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE, "OH,

25:05.233 --> 25:05.766
IT'S JUST THE GAYS.

25:05.833 --> 25:07.300
IT'S FINE."

25:07.366 --> 25:08.133
RIGHT.

25:08.200 --> 25:08.966
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IF

25:09.033 --> 25:09.800
MONKEYPOX WERE SPREADING THROUGH

25:09.866 --> 25:10.533
HETEROSEXUAL SEX, THINGS WOULD

25:10.600 --> 25:11.366
BE DIFFERENT.

25:11.433 --> 25:12.266
BY NOW, YOU'D PROBABLY BE ABLE

25:12.333 --> 25:13.366
TO GET A FREE VAX WITH PURCHASE

25:13.433 --> 25:14.333
- AT EVERY J.
- CREW IN THE COUNTRY.

25:14.400 --> 25:15.200
BECAUSE, LISTEN, IT IS NOT

25:15.266 --> 25:15.933
HOMOPHOBIC TO ACKNOWLEDGE WHO'S

25:16.000 --> 25:16.700
CURRENTLY MOST AFFECTED, WHICH

25:16.766 --> 25:17.600
IS GAY AND BISEXUAL MEN, SEX

25:17.666 --> 25:18.366
WORKERS, AND PEOPLE WHO

25:18.433 --> 25:19.566
PARTICIPATE IN SEX WITH MULTIPLE

25:19.633 --> 25:20.933
PARTNERS.

25:21.000 --> 25:22.300
WHAT IS HOMOPHOBIC IS WHEN YOU

25:22.366 --> 25:23.633
BLAME OR SHAME THE PEOPLE WHO

25:23.700 --> 25:24.600
ARE SUFFERING, OR WHEN YOU

25:24.666 --> 25:26.066
DECIDE YOU DON'T NEED TO CARE

25:26.133 --> 25:27.066
ABOUT THIS, BECAUSE YOU DON'T

25:27.133 --> 25:28.333
SEE THEIR LIVES AS VALUABLE OR

25:28.400 --> 25:29.266
THEIR SUFFERING AS

25:29.333 --> 25:31.266
CONSEQUENTIAL.

25:31.333 --> 25:33.066
AND THAT IS WHERE THERE ARE

25:33.133 --> 25:34.466
STRONG ECHOES OF THE AIDS CRISIS

25:34.533 --> 25:35.233
IN SOME OF THE DISCUSSION AROUND

25:35.300 --> 25:37.000
MONKEYPOX.

25:37.066 --> 25:38.366
JUST LISTEN TO MARJORIE TAYLOR

25:38.433 --> 25:40.600
GREENE, ELECTED OFFICIAL AND

25:40.666 --> 25:42.700
ONE-STAR UBER PASSENGER, WHO

25:44.500 --> 25:45.700
>> OF COURSE, MONKEYPOX IS A

25:45.766 --> 25:46.266
THREAT TO SOME PEOPLE IN OUR

25:46.333 --> 25:49.633
POPULATION.

25:49.700 --> 25:51.200
BUT WE KNOW WHAT CAUSES IT AND

25:51.266 --> 25:52.733
THAT'S PRETTY MUCH -- IT'S

25:52.800 --> 25:53.333
BASICALLY A SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED

25:53.400 --> 25:55.466
DISEASE.

25:55.533 --> 25:57.033
SO IT'S NOT A THREAT TO MOST OF

25:57.100 --> 25:59.500
THE POPULATION.

25:59.566 --> 26:00.666
AND SO, IT'S NOT A GLOBAL

26:00.733 --> 26:03.633
PANDEMIC, IT'S REALLY NOT.

26:03.700 --> 26:05.700
AND PEOPLE JUST HAVE TO LAUGH AT

26:05.766 --> 26:09.066
IT, MOCK IT, AND REJECT IT.

26:09.133 --> 26:09.700
SO, I THINK IT'S -- IT'S ANOTHER

26:09.766 --> 26:11.300
SCAM.

26:11.366 --> 26:11.933
OKAY, OBVIOUSLY, THAT'S

26:12.000 --> 26:12.800
RIDICULOUS.

26:12.866 --> 26:13.666
IF THE WAY TO GET RID OF

26:13.733 --> 26:15.100
SOMETHING AWFUL WAS FOR PEOPLE

26:15.166 --> 26:16.266
TO LAUGH AT IT AND MOCK IT, THAT

26:16.333 --> 26:22.366
WOMAN CLEARLY WOULDN'T BE IN

26:22.433 --> 26:22.966
CONGRESS AND YET, HERE WE ALL

26:23.033 --> 26:26.066
ARE.

26:27.566 --> 26:28.233
GREENE ALSO TWEETED, "IF

26:28.300 --> 26:29.033
MONKEYPOX IS A SEXUALLY

26:29.100 --> 26:30.200
TRANSMITTED DISEASE, WHY ARE

26:30.266 --> 26:32.166
KIDS GETTING IT?" IN AN ACT OF

26:32.233 --> 26:32.966
OBVIOUS DOG WHISTLE BIGOTRY,

26:33.033 --> 26:33.766
SUGGESTING GAY PEOPLE ARE A

26:33.833 --> 26:35.033
DANGER TO CHILDREN.

26:35.100 --> 26:35.733
WHEN WHAT'S CLEARLY AN ACTUAL

26:35.800 --> 26:37.033
DANGER TO CHILDREN IS THE QANON

26:37.100 --> 26:38.600
CONGRESSWOMAN WHO ONCE TWEETED

26:38.666 --> 26:39.400
"THE KIDS AT UVALDE NEEDED

26:39.466 --> 26:42.366
JR-15s"

26:42.433 --> 26:44.133
AND I KNOW THERE'S A TEMPTATION,

26:44.200 --> 26:44.766
WHEN YOU SEE HOMOPHOBIA LIKE

26:44.833 --> 26:47.966
THAT, TO PUSH BACK AND SAY,

26:48.033 --> 26:49.500
"HEY!

26:49.566 --> 26:50.833
IT'S NOT JUST GAY PEOPLE, ANYONE

26:50.900 --> 26:51.566
CAN GET MONKEYPOX," WHICH IS

26:51.633 --> 26:53.900
TRUE.

26:53.966 --> 26:55.066
BUT IT'S ALSO TRUE THAT, WHILE

26:55.133 --> 26:56.533
ANYONE CAN GET IT, RIGHT NOW,

26:56.600 --> 26:57.133
CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE GETTING IT

26:57.200 --> 26:58.800
MORE.

26:58.866 --> 27:00.233
AND CRUCIALLY, THEY ARE THE ONES

27:00.300 --> 27:02.000
WHO SHOULD BE RECEIVING THE

27:02.066 --> 27:03.566
LION'S SHARE OF THE RESOURCES

27:03.633 --> 27:05.333
RIGHT NOW, AND SPECIFIC,

27:05.400 --> 27:07.333
TARGETED PUBLIC-HEALTH GUIDANCE.

27:07.400 --> 27:08.733
AND THE MESSAGING HERE CAN

27:08.800 --> 27:09.366
ADMITTEDLY BE A BIT OF A

27:09.433 --> 27:11.433
MINEFIELD.

27:11.500 --> 27:12.833
THE QUEER COMMUNITY MAY BE

27:12.900 --> 27:14.300
UNDERSTANDABLY RELUCTANT TO HEAR

27:14.366 --> 27:15.933
SOME STRAIGHT PERSON LECTURING

27:16.000 --> 27:17.700
THEM ABOUT THEIR SEX LIVES,

27:17.766 --> 27:19.366
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT ADVICE,

27:19.433 --> 27:20.866
HISTORICALLY, HAS SO OFTEN COME

27:20.933 --> 27:22.100
WITH AN AIR OF DISAPPROVAL ABOUT

27:22.166 --> 27:23.266
IT.

27:23.333 --> 27:25.066
AND SOME, IN THIS CURRENT

27:25.133 --> 27:26.566
CRISIS, HAVE BEEN TONE DEAF.

27:26.633 --> 27:28.566
ONE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIAL HERE

27:28.633 --> 27:29.766
IN NEW YORK PUSHED FOR A MORE

27:29.833 --> 27:31.566
ABSTINENCE-BASED APPROACH,

27:31.633 --> 27:32.866
POSTING ON HIS WEBSITE, "IF WE

27:32.933 --> 27:34.400
HAD AN OUTBREAK ASSOCIATED WITH

27:34.466 --> 27:35.400
BOWLING, WOULD WE NOT WARN

27:35.466 --> 27:37.966
PEOPLE TO STOP BOWLING?"

27:38.033 --> 27:38.600
WHICH ISN'T A GREAT WAY TO PUT

27:38.666 --> 27:40.333
IT.

27:40.400 --> 27:41.633
IN FACT, AN OPENLY GAY HEALTH

27:41.700 --> 27:43.766
OFFICIAL RESPONDED BY TWEETING

27:43.833 --> 27:45.166
"A WHITE STRAIGHT CIS MAN

27:45.233 --> 27:47.233
COMPARING SEX TO BOWLING TELLS

27:47.300 --> 27:50.200
ME SO MUCH ABOUT STRAIGHT SEX."

27:51.600 --> 27:52.733
WHICH, HONESTLY?

27:52.800 --> 27:53.966
THAT'S A FAIR HIT.

27:54.033 --> 27:56.000
THAT'S A FAIR HIT, RIGHT THERE.

27:56.066 --> 27:56.633
THE OFFICIAL WHO WROTE THAT

27:56.700 --> 27:57.700
TWEET IS ACTUALLY NOW THE DEPUTY

27:57.766 --> 27:58.833
COORDINATOR OF THE FEDERAL

27:58.900 --> 28:00.133
MONKEYPOX RESPONSE, AND HE'S

28:00.200 --> 28:01.533
BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS WITH A

28:01.600 --> 28:03.066
REFRESHING FRANKNESS.

28:03.133 --> 28:04.433
LIKE IN THIS OFFICIAL VIDEO,

28:04.500 --> 28:06.200
WHERE HE WALKS THROUGH PRACTICAL

28:06.266 --> 28:07.566
STEPS TO AVOID EXPOSURE, THEN

28:07.633 --> 28:10.900
OFFERS THIS ADVICE TO PEOPLE WHO

28:10.966 --> 28:11.633
THINK THEY, OR THEIR PARTNER,

28:11.700 --> 28:12.866
MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED.

28:12.933 --> 28:13.933
>> CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING WAYS

28:14.000 --> 28:14.500
TO REDUCE THE CHANCE OF

28:14.566 --> 28:17.000
SPREADING THE VIRUS.

28:17.066 --> 28:17.800
HAVE VIRTUAL SEX WITH NO

28:17.866 --> 28:20.433
IN-PERSON CONTACT.

28:20.500 --> 28:21.566
MASTURBATE TOGETHER AT A

28:21.633 --> 28:22.866
DISTANCE WITHOUT TOUCHING EACH

28:22.933 --> 28:23.933
OTHER AND WITHOUT TOUCHING ANY

28:24.000 --> 28:25.733
RASH OR SORES.

28:25.800 --> 28:27.166
REMEMBER TO WASH YOUR HANDS

28:27.233 --> 28:29.033
WITH SOAP AND WATER AND

28:29.100 --> 28:31.033
DISINFECT FETISH GEAR, SEX TOYS,

28:31.100 --> 28:33.400
AND ANY FABRICS SUCH AS BEDDING,

28:33.466 --> 28:34.133
TOWELS, CLOTHING AFTER HAVING

28:34.200 --> 28:35.900
SEX.

28:35.966 --> 28:37.800
THAT'S GREAT!

28:37.866 --> 28:38.700
THAT IS HONESTLY SOME OF THE

28:38.766 --> 28:42.866
BEST COMMUNICATION OF PUBLIC

28:42.933 --> 28:45.533
HEALTH GUIDANCE I'VE EVER SEEN.

28:45.600 --> 28:46.100
IT'S HELPFUL, SPECIFIC, AND

28:46.166 --> 28:49.866
NON-JUDGMENTAL.

28:49.933 --> 28:50.866
AND HONESTLY, IT'S PRETTY GOOD

28:50.933 --> 28:51.733
ADVICE FOR EVERYONE.

28:51.800 --> 28:52.600
FAR MORE PEOPLE SHOULD BE

28:52.666 --> 28:53.366
EXPLORING VIRTUAL SEX WITH NO

28:53.433 --> 28:54.233
IN-PERSON CONTACT, JUST MAKE

28:54.300 --> 28:54.800
SURE YOU AREN'T DOING IT IN

28:54.866 --> 28:55.666
THE MIDDLE OF A WORK MEETING,

28:55.733 --> 28:57.066
JEFFREY.

28:57.133 --> 28:57.700
ALTHOUGH, THAT REALLY SHOULD NOT

28:57.766 --> 29:01.766
BE THAT HARD.

29:01.833 --> 29:02.333
AND IT IS NOT JUST THE

29:02.400 --> 29:03.366
GOVERNMENT.

29:03.433 --> 29:04.233
COMMUNITY GROUPS HAVE BEEN

29:04.300 --> 29:05.100
TRYING TO FRAME HEALTH ADVICE IN

29:05.166 --> 29:08.533
A WAY THAT'S MUCH MORE

29:08.600 --> 29:10.666
SEX-POSITIVE, MAKING IT MORE

29:10.733 --> 29:11.666
LIKELY TO BE WELL-RECEIVED.

29:11.733 --> 29:12.266
LIKE THIS FLYER FROM AN L.A.

29:12.333 --> 29:13.333
LGBT CENTER WITH THE VERY

29:13.400 --> 29:14.200
"FORGET SLUTTY

29:14.266 --> 29:15.033
SUMMER, HOLD OFF FOR ANAL

29:15.100 --> 29:16.500
AUTUMN!

29:16.566 --> 29:18.600
DO IT IN CIDER DONUT SEASON."

29:18.666 --> 29:20.866
WHICH, AGAIN, IS EXCELLENT.

29:20.933 --> 29:22.266
IT'S GOOD ADVICE FOR NOW, IT'S

29:22.333 --> 29:23.566
GOOD ADVICE FOR THE FALL, AND

29:23.633 --> 29:24.566
IT'S ALSO A PRETTY GOOD SLOGAN

29:24.633 --> 29:27.800
FOR DUNKIN'.

29:29.300 --> 29:30.666
AND WHILE GOOD MESSAGING IS

29:30.733 --> 29:32.633
CERTAINLY WELCOME HERE, IT IS

29:32.700 --> 29:33.666
DEPRESSING THAT WE HAVE TO RELY

29:33.733 --> 29:35.200
SO HEAVILY ON IT IN THE FIRST

29:35.266 --> 29:36.700
PLACE, GIVEN THE MANY SYSTEMIC

29:36.766 --> 29:37.366
FAILURES THAT HAVE BROUGHT US TO

29:37.433 --> 29:39.766
THIS POINT.

29:39.833 --> 29:41.366
SO, WHAT CAN WE DO NOW?

29:41.433 --> 29:42.866
WELL, IN THE SHORT TERM, THE

29:42.933 --> 29:43.433
NEXT SIX TO EIGHT WEEKS ARE

29:43.500 --> 29:44.933
GOING TO BE CRUCIAL.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.333
SO WE NEED TO BE RAMPING UP

29:46.400 --> 29:48.066
TESTING AND DATA COLLECTION, AND

29:48.133 --> 29:49.333
GETTING VACCINES AND ANTIVIRALS

29:49.400 --> 29:51.300
TO THOSE WHO NEED THEM MOST.

29:51.366 --> 29:52.866
WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

29:52.933 --> 29:54.133
QUARANTINING MORE LOGISTICALLY

29:54.200 --> 29:55.633
POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE, BECAUSE

29:55.700 --> 29:56.866
MONKEYPOX CAN REQUIRE AS LONG AS

29:56.933 --> 29:59.166
FOUR WEEKS OF ISOLATION.

29:59.233 --> 30:00.466
AND FOR MANY, THAT'S GOING TO BE

30:00.533 --> 30:01.566
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE WITHOUT

30:01.633 --> 30:04.133
EXTRA SUPPORT.

30:04.200 --> 30:05.566
BUT IN THE LONGER TERM, AS IF

30:05.633 --> 30:07.733
COVID HAD NOT ALREADY MADE THIS

30:07.800 --> 30:09.800
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR, WE BADLY NEED

30:09.866 --> 30:12.400
TO RESTRUCTURE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

30:12.466 --> 30:13.266
SYSTEM SO IT'S BETTER ABLE TO

30:13.333 --> 30:15.366
RESPOND TO A VIRAL OUTBREAK.

30:15.433 --> 30:16.000
AND I'M NOT THE ONLY ONE SAYING

30:16.066 --> 30:17.133
THAT.

30:17.200 --> 30:17.733
JUST LISTEN TO NEW YORK CITY'S

30:17.800 --> 30:18.866
HEALTH COMMISSIONER.

30:18.933 --> 30:20.600
>> IT IS FRUSTRATING.

30:20.666 --> 30:22.733
WE HAD A VACCINE, WE HAD A

30:22.800 --> 30:25.100
TREATMENT, WE HAD A TEST.

30:25.166 --> 30:27.433
AND ALL OF IT WAS KIND OF ROLLED

30:27.500 --> 30:29.966
OUT MORE SLOWLY THAN WE WOULD

30:30.033 --> 30:31.800
HAVE LIKED, BECAUSE OF THE FACT

30:31.866 --> 30:33.366
THAT OUR PERMANENT PUBLIC HEALTH

30:33.433 --> 30:34.366
INFRASTRUCTURE HAS NOT BEEN

30:34.433 --> 30:36.433
INVESTED IN FOR DECADES.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.566
YEAH, HE'S ABSOLUTELY

30:37.633 --> 30:40.000
RIGHT, AND HE IS NOT ALONE.

30:40.066 --> 30:41.166
AGAIN AND AGAIN, WHEN WE TALKED

30:41.233 --> 30:41.966
TO PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONALS

30:42.033 --> 30:43.666
THIS WEEK, THERE HAS BEEN A

30:43.733 --> 30:44.533
SENSE THAT THIS WAS A GIGANTIC

30:44.600 --> 30:46.733
FUCK UP.

30:46.800 --> 30:51.333
JAY VARMA, AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST WHO

30:51.400 --> 30:52.200
PREVIOUSLY WORKED AT THE CDC,

30:52.266 --> 30:53.066
TOLD US THIS WAS A REAL, PERFECT

30:53.133 --> 30:53.900
STRESS TEST FOR US.

30:53.966 --> 30:54.633
IN THIS SITUATION, WE WERE

30:54.700 --> 30:55.900
UNIQUELY PREPARED.

30:55.966 --> 30:56.733
WE KIND OF HAD THE QUESTIONS

30:56.800 --> 30:58.433
AHEAD OF TIME.

30:58.500 --> 31:01.266
WE'RE GOING TO THROW YOU A

31:01.333 --> 31:01.866
VIRUS YOU ALREADY HAVE A TEST

31:01.933 --> 31:02.666
FOR, ALREADY HAVE VACCINE FOR,

31:02.733 --> 31:03.966
ALREADY HAVE A DRUG YOUR

31:04.033 --> 31:05.100
GOVERNMENT PAID FOR AND

31:05.166 --> 31:06.800
DEVELOPED AND DISCOVERED AND

31:06.866 --> 31:07.733
STOCKPILED, LET'S SEE HOW YOU

31:07.800 --> 31:10.000
RESPOND TO THAT.

31:10.066 --> 31:12.366
AND WE SCREWED IT UP.

31:12.433 --> 31:14.166
WHICH IS HUMILIATINGLY BAD.

31:14.233 --> 31:16.300
BASICALLY, ON A SCALE FROM

31:16.366 --> 31:18.233
1-100, WE SCORED A "NO."

31:20.166 --> 31:22.066
BUT THE THING IS, EVEN IF WE DO

31:22.133 --> 31:23.466
CONTAIN THIS OUTBREAK, AND EVEN

31:23.533 --> 31:25.533
IF WE BUILD UP OUR PUBLIC HEALTH

31:25.600 --> 31:26.333
INFRASTRUCTURE, THERE'S A BIGGER

31:26.400 --> 31:28.466
CONVERSATION WORTH HAVING HERE.

31:28.533 --> 31:29.766
BECAUSE FOR FAR TOO LONG, WE'VE

31:29.833 --> 31:31.766
INDULGED IN THE MAGICAL THINKING

31:31.833 --> 31:33.533
THAT VIRUSES THAT EXIST

31:33.600 --> 31:34.633
SOMEWHERE ELSE, A, DON'T MATTER,

31:34.700 --> 31:37.600
AND B, WILL STAY THERE.

31:37.666 --> 31:39.800
AND MONKEYPOX IS SUCH A CLEAR

31:39.866 --> 31:41.233
EXAMPLE OF HOW FLAWED AND RACIST

31:41.300 --> 31:44.200
THAT THINKING IS.

31:44.266 --> 31:45.733
WE HAD 20 MILLION DOSES OF A

31:45.800 --> 31:47.100
VACCINE THAT COULD'VE HELPED

31:47.166 --> 31:49.366
COUNTRIES IN AFRICA THAT WERE

31:49.433 --> 31:53.500
KNOWN TO BE HIGH-RISK FOR

31:53.566 --> 31:54.166
OUTBREAKS, AND WE DIDN'T HELP

31:54.233 --> 31:55.200
THEM.

31:55.266 --> 31:55.766
AND WE'RE STILL NOT HELPING

31:55.833 --> 31:56.866
THEM.

31:56.933 --> 31:57.533
THE SUDDEN GLOBAL DEMAND FOR

31:57.600 --> 31:59.233
VACCINES MEANS THAT CURRENTLY,

31:59.300 --> 32:00.366
ZERO DOSES ARE GOING TO NIGERIA

32:00.433 --> 32:02.600
AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN AFRICA.

32:02.666 --> 32:04.300
WHICH I KNOW SOUNDS AWFUL, BUT

32:04.366 --> 32:05.666
TO BE FAIR, INDIFFERENCE TO

32:05.733 --> 32:10.366
THOSE SUFFERING FROM POX-BASED

32:10.433 --> 32:12.000
VIRUSES HAS BEEN THE STORY OF

32:12.066 --> 32:14.066
AMERICA FROM DAY ONE.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.566
AND I KNOW FIXING ALL OF THIS

32:15.633 --> 32:16.200
MAY FEEL DAUNTING.

32:16.266 --> 32:16.866
BUT WE'RE LIVING THROUGH THE

32:16.933 --> 32:17.700
ALTERNATIVE RIGHT NOW, AND IT'S

32:17.766 --> 32:20.300
NOT GREAT.

32:20.366 --> 32:21.033
AND THINK OF IT THIS WAY, IF WE

32:21.100 --> 32:21.933
CAN ACTUALLY GET OUR ACT

32:22.000 --> 32:23.666
TOGETHER, MAYBE FINALLY THIS

32:23.733 --> 32:25.200
COUNTRY, AND INDEED THE WHOLE

32:25.266 --> 32:26.466
WORLD, CAN HAVE THE ANAL AUTUMN

32:26.533 --> 32:29.366
THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN PROMISED.

32:29.700 --> 32:31.633
AND NOW THIS.

32:31.700 --> 32:33.633
AND NOW, WALTER

32:33.700 --> 32:35.566
FROM BUTLER, INDIANA, HAS SOME

32:35.633 --> 32:37.733
THOUGHTS ON MORTALITY.

32:37.800 --> 32:39.000
>> LET'S TALK TO WALTER WHO IS

32:39.066 --> 32:40.733
CALLING FROM BUTLER, INDIANA.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.466
WALTER, GOOD MORNING.

32:42.533 --> 32:43.366
>> GOOD MORNING, THANKS FOR

32:43.433 --> 32:45.366
TAKING MY CALL.

32:45.433 --> 32:46.666
I'M CONFUSED AND I DON'T MEAN TO

32:46.733 --> 32:47.433
BE SNARKY BUT SO WHAT?

32:47.500 --> 32:48.400
THEY DIE.

32:48.466 --> 32:49.033
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA DIE, YOU'RE

32:49.100 --> 32:50.633
GONNA DIE.

32:50.700 --> 32:56.466
I HAVEN'T BEEN TO A DOCTOR

32:56.533 --> 32:57.366
SINCE -- I'M 65, 41 YEARS.

32:57.433 --> 32:58.266
I DON'T TAKE ANY VITAMINS, I

32:58.333 --> 32:59.000
DON'T TRY TO EAT WELL, AND I DO

32:59.066 --> 32:59.533
WHAT I WANT.

32:59.600 --> 33:00.400
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA GO, YOU'RE

33:00.466 --> 33:01.366
GONNA GO.

33:01.433 --> 33:02.233
I'VE NEVER TAKEN A MEDICATION IN

33:02.300 --> 33:03.900
MY LIFE, I'VE NEVER TAKEN

33:03.966 --> 33:11.633
ANYTHING EXCEPT A VITAMIN.

33:11.700 --> 33:12.666
AND I GOT ALL SORTS OF HITCHES

33:12.733 --> 33:13.333
AND PROBLEMS AND THIS AND THAT.

33:13.400 --> 33:14.166
I DON'T GO TO A DOCTOR, AND I

33:14.233 --> 33:14.833
FEEL LIKE WHENEVER THE GOOD LORD

33:14.900 --> 33:15.533
IS READY TO TAKE ME HOME, I'M

33:15.600 --> 33:18.566
GOING TO BE TAKEN HOME.

33:18.633 --> 33:19.200
IN THE END, WE ALL DIE ANYWAY SO

33:19.266 --> 33:19.800
WHAT DOES IT MATTER WHICH WAY

33:19.866 --> 33:20.600
YOU GO?

33:20.666 --> 33:21.400
JUST SHUT UP AND DEAL WITH LIFE

33:21.466 --> 33:22.200
THE BEST YOU CAN.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.100
MY FRIENDS AND I WOULD GET OUT

33:23.166 --> 33:24.133
OF THE HOUSE EARLY IN THE

33:24.200 --> 33:25.000
MORNING, WE'D GET ON OUR

33:25.066 --> 33:27.166
BICYCLES, AND WE'D PLAY

33:27.233 --> 33:31.766
STICKBALL IN THE STREETS, AND IF

33:31.833 --> 33:35.100
WE WANTED TO GO UP TO SEARS WE'D

33:35.166 --> 33:35.700
ACTUALLY HANG ON THE BACK OF A

33:35.766 --> 33:36.433
BUS AND DRIVE UP OVER --

33:36.500 --> 33:37.433
>> DON'T DO THAT.

33:37.500 --> 33:38.533
>> IT WAS JUST INSANE.

33:38.600 --> 33:40.666
NOBODY GETS OUT ALIVE.

33:40.733 --> 33:44.033
WHATEVER, THE MYSTERY OF LIFE.

33:44.100 --> 33:45.333
WHAT'S MY END GAME?

33:45.400 --> 33:46.033
TO BE IN A NURSING HOME?

33:46.100 --> 33:46.766
NOT KNOW WHAT I'M DOING, WITH

33:46.833 --> 33:47.566
DROOL COMING OUT OF MY MOUTH,

33:47.633 --> 33:48.366
AND EVERYONE AROUND ME IS DEAD?

33:48.433 --> 33:49.266
NOT ON MY WATCH.

33:49.333 --> 33:50.066
>> ALL RIGHT.

33:50.133 --> 33:50.866
>> YOU DON'T WIN STAYING AROUND

33:50.933 --> 33:52.366
LONGER.

33:52.433 --> 33:52.966
EVERYBODY PASSES AWAY AND YOU

33:53.033 --> 33:53.633
HAVE NOBODY TO CARE FOR YOU

33:53.700 --> 33:56.100
ANYWAY.

33:56.166 --> 33:57.133
I THINK YOU SHOULD JUST THROW

33:57.200 --> 33:58.066
OUT ALL YOUR MEDICATIONS, GET UP

33:58.133 --> 33:59.033
EVERY DAY, THANK THE LORD FOR

33:59.100 --> 34:04.433
THE DAY YOU HAVE.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.133
WHEN YOU'RE GONNA GO, GO.

34:05.200 --> 34:05.700
NOTHING IS PROMISED TO YOU.

34:05.766 --> 34:06.666
WHEN YOU WANT TO DIE, JUST DROP

34:06.733 --> 34:10.100
DEAD.

34:11.166 --> 34:12.166
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

34:12.233 --> 34:13.233
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.

34:13.300 --> 34:17.300
THANKS FOR WATCHING, GOOD NIGHT!
