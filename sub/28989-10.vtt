WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.207
(HARVEY READING)

00:02.294 --> 00:05.457
Donna told me there's no one
better to get rid of Faye than us.

00:05.547 --> 00:06.708
What did you have in mind?

00:06.798 --> 00:09.256
Why don't we skip the introductions
and jump right to the suing?

00:09.343 --> 00:11.380
Defend me, and win,
and I'll go.

00:11.470 --> 00:13.211
But you cheat,
I'll tell the Bar

00:13.305 --> 00:15.592
this firm should be
dismantled permanently.

00:15.682 --> 00:17.673
Is this some kind of joke?
HARVEY: No, it's not.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.975
Harvey Specter and Louis Litt
for the defense, Your Honor.

00:20.062 --> 00:21.769
There is no way
they would have known

00:21.855 --> 00:25.064
about that previous lawsuit
if you hadn't fed it to them.

00:25.150 --> 00:27.812
We didn't feed them anything!
It was me.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.485
You don't do something like
that without running it by me.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.606
Don't you talk
to me like that.

00:30.697 --> 00:32.028
I am a senior partner,
and I deserve...

00:32.115 --> 00:33.981
And I'm going against
two of my closest friends,

00:34.076 --> 00:35.942
and I can't even talk
to the one guy

00:36.036 --> 00:37.993
who could understand what
the hell I'm going through!

00:38.080 --> 00:40.742
So, I don't give a shit if
you're a senior partner or not.

00:40.832 --> 00:42.914
We had a plan.
Something changed.

00:43.001 --> 00:45.038
I wanna know what it is.
We can't talk about it.

00:45.128 --> 00:47.665
God damn it, Harvey, when
the hell did you stop trusting me?

00:47.756 --> 00:50.123
They didn't give Mike
that testimony. I did.

00:50.217 --> 00:51.799
I respect you owning up
to your mistake.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.717
But I want you packed
within the hour.

00:53.804 --> 00:54.794
What?
You're fired.

00:57.933 --> 00:59.264
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

01:00.852 --> 01:02.434
What is it now, Faye?

01:02.521 --> 01:03.682
You want me
to shoot my brother?

01:03.772 --> 01:06.059
I'm calling to tell you
Katrina came to me,

01:06.149 --> 01:09.938
and said that she was the one who
gave them that information, not you.

01:10.362 --> 01:12.103
What did you do?
It doesn't matter what I did.

01:12.197 --> 01:15.986
What matters is that I was
justified in firing Samantha.

01:16.076 --> 01:19.114
You prove that tomorrow, I'll
honor our original agreement,

01:19.204 --> 01:22.196
and you won't have to prove that
Samantha fabricated that evidence.

01:22.291 --> 01:23.281
And if I can't?

01:23.375 --> 01:25.457
Then I'll be forced to put the
only other person who knows

01:25.544 --> 01:27.000
what she did on the stand.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.041
HARVEY: Hey.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.877
You didn't have to wait up.
No, I didn't.

01:38.098 --> 01:39.964
But I thought
after a night out with Mike,

01:40.058 --> 01:42.174
I might actually see you
smile, but you're not smiling.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.306
No, I'm not.
What happened?

01:44.396 --> 01:46.728
I told Mike I'm calling him
to the stand tomorrow.

01:46.815 --> 01:49.523
What? Harvey,
you can't do that to them.

01:49.610 --> 01:51.351
Donna, if we don't win
this thing tomorrow,

01:51.445 --> 01:52.856
Faye's putting me
on the stand.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.937
Well, then find another way
that doesn't involve this.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.364
This is the way, and I came
around because I get that.

01:57.451 --> 02:00.193
Now, if you can't get it, too, I'm
not going to debate you on this.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.277
I'm going to sleep.

02:01.371 --> 02:04.909
Harvey, look, if you say it's
the only way, I believe you.

02:06.251 --> 02:08.413
It's just tonight was supposed
to give you a break.

02:09.378 --> 02:10.744
Not make things worse.

02:12.049 --> 02:14.541
Donna, listen to me.

02:14.635 --> 02:17.127
I know you called Mike
because you knew I needed him.

02:17.554 --> 02:18.965
And for a couple of hours,

02:19.056 --> 02:21.388
I wasn't thinking about
the case or tomorrow,

02:21.516 --> 02:23.382
or even how much
I miss my mom.

02:24.645 --> 02:28.479
You gave me what I needed,
but it's time for me to win this thing.

02:28.565 --> 02:29.555
You know,

02:30.901 --> 02:32.733
I never told you
how many times I thought

02:32.819 --> 02:34.901
about us being together
over the years.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.194
It was usually
nights like tonight,

02:36.281 --> 02:38.773
when I didn't know if things
were gonna turn out okay,

02:38.867 --> 02:41.859
but I knew it doesn't matter
if it's Faye or Tanner

02:41.953 --> 02:43.614
or Hardman or Goliath.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.872
Whoever it is,

02:46.958 --> 02:49.950
no one stands a chance
against Harvey Specter.

02:52.756 --> 02:55.214
And that's the sexiest thing
in the world.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.540
What are you saying?

02:56.635 --> 02:59.548
I'm saying that
we should go in there

02:59.638 --> 03:03.051
and earn you the best night's
sleep you ever had.

03:11.733 --> 03:14.316
Your Honor, the defense calls
Mike Ross to the stand.

03:14.403 --> 03:17.441
Objection, my client has a
right to attorney-client privilege.

03:17.531 --> 03:20.364
And per Kern V. California,
I'm not going to ask about things

03:20.450 --> 03:21.440
since you've been her lawyer.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.276
I'm going to ask about
what happened before.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.579
Then there's nothing for me to
testify to, and Kern doesn't apply.

03:26.665 --> 03:27.655
Are you kidding me?

03:27.749 --> 03:31.287
You went against her on the very
case you say led to her dismissal.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.459
Is this true, Mr. Ross?

03:33.088 --> 03:35.546
MIKE: Yes, Your Honor.
JUDGE: Then swear him in.

03:40.011 --> 03:43.220
Mr. Ross, isn't it true that Ms.
Wheeler wiped the floor with you

03:43.306 --> 03:44.888
on the
Brick Street Athletics case?

03:44.975 --> 03:46.261
She won, yes.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.055
And what were your feelings
after she wiped the floor with you?

03:49.146 --> 03:51.478
Objection, Your Honor.
Baiting. HARVEY: I'll rephrase.

03:51.565 --> 03:53.932
What were your feelings
after your client lost

03:54.025 --> 03:56.767
his precious little company that
you were trying to help him start?

03:56.862 --> 03:58.352
I was upset.
Upset?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.484
Isn't it true that
the night you lost that case,

04:00.574 --> 04:02.235
you accused me
of fabricating evidence?

04:02.325 --> 04:03.611
I did, but...
And when I denied it,

04:03.702 --> 04:05.409
what did you say exactly?
SAMANTHA: Objection.

04:05.495 --> 04:08.032
The witness can't be asked
to recall the exact words

04:08.123 --> 04:09.909
of a conversation
that happened weeks ago.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.616
He can if he has
a perfect memory.

04:11.710 --> 04:13.826
You do have a perfect memory,
don't you, Mr. Ross?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.661
Isn't that what
you're always bragging about?

04:15.756 --> 04:17.245
Yes, but...
No "buts".

04:17.339 --> 04:20.423
You said she fabricated evidence.
You said she bribed somebody.

04:20.510 --> 04:23.093
You said she cheated your
client out of his company.

04:23.180 --> 04:24.887
Now, I may not have
a perfect memory,

04:24.973 --> 04:26.259
but I sure as hell
remember that.

04:26.349 --> 04:28.511
Am I wrong?
I don't care what I said.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.809
I had no proof that
anyone fabricated anything,

04:30.896 --> 04:32.978
and neither did your client
the night she fired mine.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.725
HARVEY: No, she
just knew it in her gut.

04:34.816 --> 04:37.604
Exactly like you did the night
you came screaming at me.

04:38.111 --> 04:40.773
No further questions,
Your Honor.

04:40.947 --> 04:43.359
I said something else that
night that clearly you've forgotten.

04:43.492 --> 04:45.859
Objection. We didn't ask... MIKE:
I said that you've lost yourself,

04:45.952 --> 04:48.319
and as far as I'm concerned,
that's still true.

04:49.164 --> 04:50.996
And as far as
the law is concerned,

04:51.082 --> 04:52.914
my opening statement
is still true

04:53.001 --> 04:56.369
because it doesn't matter if
Ms. Wheeler crossed a line or not.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.670
Faye Richardson had cause,

04:58.757 --> 05:00.794
and nothing you say
is gonna change that.

05:05.847 --> 05:09.181
(SINGING) See the money
wanna stay for your meal

05:09.267 --> 05:12.350
Get another piece of pie
for your wife

05:12.437 --> 05:15.896
Everybody wanna know
how it feel

05:15.982 --> 05:19.270
Everybody wanna see
what it's like

05:19.361 --> 05:22.524
I'll even eat a bean pie
I don't mind

05:22.614 --> 05:26.403
Me and missy is so early
Busy, busy making money

05:26.493 --> 05:27.654
All right!

05:27.744 --> 05:31.487
All step back
I'm 'bout to dance

05:33.458 --> 05:35.415
The greenback boogie

05:39.047 --> 05:40.833
Alex, what are you doing here?

05:40.924 --> 05:42.585
I guess you've been
living under a rock

05:42.676 --> 05:44.508
because I'm here
to tell you we won.

05:44.594 --> 05:45.584
Faye's gonna be gone,

05:45.679 --> 05:47.636
which means you can come back,
and so can Samantha.

05:48.932 --> 05:49.967
That's great.

05:50.058 --> 05:52.390
Katrina, why do you sound like
I just told you you have cancer?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.265
I'll tell you why, because
Harvey treated me like shit.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.938
I got fired, and then
to top it all off,

05:58.024 --> 06:00.891
I haven't heard from a single
one of you until this second.

06:00.986 --> 06:02.351
I get it.

06:02.445 --> 06:03.435
And none of that would've

06:03.530 --> 06:04.861
happened if we would
have told you the truth.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.564
But that was a mistake,

06:06.658 --> 06:08.740
and if no one else
has said it yet,

06:08.827 --> 06:09.817
I'm sorry.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.494
That makes one of you, Alex,
and I appreciate it.

06:12.581 --> 06:15.414
But right now, I'm not even
sure I want to come back.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.961
Thank you.

06:23.717 --> 06:25.799
What the fuck was that?

06:25.886 --> 06:27.297
It was us doing
what we had to.

06:27.387 --> 06:29.094
Yeah, and that bullshit
might work on everyone else,

06:29.180 --> 06:30.170
but it doesn't work on me.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.632
Robert...
God damn it, Louis!

06:32.726 --> 06:34.091
You were supposed
to be on her side.

06:34.185 --> 06:36.347
Listen to me,
I know how this looks,

06:36.438 --> 06:37.803
but you are gonna
have to trust us.

06:37.898 --> 06:39.809
That's getting
pretty hard to do.

06:39.900 --> 06:41.186
And after that
little stunt with Mike,

06:41.276 --> 06:43.813
Samantha's only move is to drop
this thing unless you can tell me...

06:43.904 --> 06:45.520
What? No,
she can't do that.

06:45.614 --> 06:47.275
Louis, it sounds like

06:47.365 --> 06:48.981
you give a shit about
what we do after all.

06:49.075 --> 06:51.533
So, fix this goddamn thing,
or I'm gonna fix it myself.

06:56.750 --> 06:57.990
Good, you're here.

06:58.084 --> 07:01.543
So are you, but not for long
because I did what you asked.

07:01.630 --> 07:03.086
And if you think you're gonna
weasel out of this...

07:03.173 --> 07:04.629
I'm not weaseling
out of anything.

07:04.716 --> 07:07.208
But you haven't done what
I asked, at least not yet.

07:07.344 --> 07:09.085
What are you talking about?
Tomorrow morning,

07:09.179 --> 07:10.840
you're taking the stand
against Samantha.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.012
What did you just say?

07:12.098 --> 07:14.339
I said
you're taking the stand.

07:14.476 --> 07:15.466
Bullshit, I am!
Harvey...

07:15.560 --> 07:18.143
No, you said we didn't have
to prove she did anything.

07:18.229 --> 07:19.890
And I also said
we needed to win.

07:19.981 --> 07:20.971
No,
We did win.

07:21.066 --> 07:22.352
It looks like
we're going to win.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.558
But this is my integrity
on the line,

07:24.653 --> 07:26.564
and I'm not
leaving things to chance.

07:26.655 --> 07:28.521
And if you try to walk away,
I'll subpoena you,

07:28.615 --> 07:31.107
put you up as a hostile
witness, and cross you myself.

07:31.201 --> 07:32.783
You know what,
I am hostile,

07:32.869 --> 07:35.327
but you're every bit as
vindictive as I said you are.

07:35.413 --> 07:37.154
And you pretend
to be Robin Hood,

07:37.248 --> 07:39.785
when you're really just
a shake oil salesman.

07:39.876 --> 07:41.617
Well, I'm not buying it.

07:41.711 --> 07:45.295
So one way or another, you're
taking the stand tomorrow,

07:45.382 --> 07:47.214
and you're telling the truth.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.066
What are you doing here?

08:06.152 --> 08:08.860
I'm here because it's time
I told you the truth.

08:08.947 --> 08:12.315
Is this something
we're gonna need whiskey for?

08:13.868 --> 08:15.905
Faye offered a deal.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.112
Win, and she leaves.

08:18.206 --> 08:21.449
Refuse to help, and she
goes after Samantha's license.

08:21.543 --> 08:22.704
Then to hell with this case.

08:22.794 --> 08:24.626
I'll call Samantha. We'll
drop this thing right now.

08:24.713 --> 08:26.875
That's not an option.
Never was.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.876
Because if Faye suspects us
of tanking it...

08:28.967 --> 08:32.085
She won't just stay here,
she'll wipe us off the map.

08:32.178 --> 08:34.089
And the cherry on top,

08:34.806 --> 08:36.672
she's putting me
on the stand tomorrow.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.097
What?

08:38.183 --> 08:39.799
Harvey,
Samantha told you the truth.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.018
You can't take the stand. I've
been over it from every angle.

08:42.105 --> 08:45.143
We can't stop it. There's
only one thing left for me to do.

08:45.233 --> 08:47.440
Wait, please tell me that
you are not planning on lying.

08:47.527 --> 08:50.736
Mike, it's the only way.
I say I can't remember.

08:50.822 --> 08:53.735
Faye'|| call me before the
Bar. I'll just stick to my story.

08:53.825 --> 08:55.782
And then she will convince
them to take your license,

08:55.869 --> 08:58.657
and then what the hell
did we do this for?

08:58.747 --> 09:02.206
You did it for me.
That's the end of it.

09:02.292 --> 09:05.956
I just came here to tell you
that I never stopped trusting you.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.084
No.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.707
We're not going down
this way.

09:12.802 --> 09:14.418
Did you hear me?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.924
I just told you I already
looked at every possibility.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.676
And what was the first thing
you taught me to do

09:18.767 --> 09:20.053
when someone puts
a gun to your head?

09:20.143 --> 09:22.054
There aren't 146 ways
out of this.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.601
Good, 'cause
all we need is one.

09:23.688 --> 09:25.850
And the answer to this
is to take that gun back,

09:25.940 --> 09:27.476
and point it
at her goddamn head.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.355
And I'm telling you
Faye isn't like anyone else.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.358
We can't just blackmail her.
She won't fold.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.568
Well, then we have to
make her think that

09:35.658 --> 09:38.025
if she hands us in, they're
gonna believe us, not her.

09:38.119 --> 09:39.109
Meaning?

09:39.204 --> 09:41.366
Harvey, you and I conned
the world for years.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.495
I think it's time
for one last con.

09:48.755 --> 09:51.918
All right, Robert,
we have our drinks.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.041
I'm here. Now, what is it?

09:54.135 --> 09:56.547
You know what it is.
You saw what happened today.

09:56.638 --> 09:58.549
And if you're about to
suggest I drop this thing...

09:58.640 --> 10:00.927
I'm about to tell you I saw Louis,
and they're not gonna back down.

10:01.017 --> 10:03.179
Then bring on tomorrow,
because all they have is hearsay.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.010
And that doesn't mean
you won't lose.

10:05.105 --> 10:09.064
Samantha, you don't have
any more cards to play.

10:09.150 --> 10:11.357
And Mike said the exact
same thing an hour after court.

10:11.444 --> 10:12.479
Then listen to him,

10:12.570 --> 10:14.982
because that boy has never
waved the white flag in his life.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.063
Oh, yes, he has.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.366
He was a fraud who went
on trial knowing he was guilty,

10:19.452 --> 10:23.320
but he still fought tooth and
nail until he lost faith in himself.

10:23.414 --> 10:26.748
The second he did that,
that's when he went to prison.

10:26.876 --> 10:28.662
Well, this is not the
same as that. You're right.

10:28.753 --> 10:31.336
They had him dead to rights,
but they don't have us.

10:31.422 --> 10:34.585
Oh, they've got us, all right,
and it's a lot worse than you think.

10:34.676 --> 10:35.916
What are you
talking about?

10:36.010 --> 10:37.592
Harvey cut a deal
with Faye.

10:37.679 --> 10:38.885
They beat us
fair and square,

10:38.972 --> 10:40.804
she tells the Bar they don't
need oversight anymore,

10:40.890 --> 10:41.880
and she leaves you alone.

10:41.975 --> 10:44.137
But now, she's coming
after your license anyway.

10:44.227 --> 10:46.264
Then all that's left
for us to do is win.

10:46.354 --> 10:49.767
That's not gonna happen. She
subpoenaed Harvey to testify tomorrow.

10:50.108 --> 10:52.566
(SCOFFS) Then why the hell
did you just waltz in here

10:52.652 --> 10:53.938
like it's a Sunday afternoon?

10:54.028 --> 10:56.861
Because what you're saying is
win or lose, we're screwed.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.689
No, we're not,
Samantha. She is.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.491
"Cause Harvey taught me what to do
when your back's up against the wall.

11:01.578 --> 11:03.239
You break
the goddamn thing down.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.161
And I'm guessing you have
the keys to the bulldozer?

11:05.248 --> 11:06.329
Yes, I do.

11:06.416 --> 11:08.498
They called Harvey,

11:08.585 --> 11:10.701
I think it's time we call
a witness of our own.

11:14.215 --> 11:15.922
You've got to be kidding me.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.091
Harvey sends you here
to get me to save him

11:18.178 --> 11:19.794
when he hasn't even
apologized to me.

11:19.888 --> 11:21.925
Katrina, he sent me here
because he felt like shit

11:22.015 --> 11:23.301
about how he treated you.

11:23.391 --> 11:25.598
He wanted to come himself,
and I insisted it be me.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.596
Why? Because you knew
he wasn't really sorry?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.395
Because this isn't just to
help him. It's to help all of us.

11:30.481 --> 11:33.269
And it's one thing for me to bluff,
that I'm going to lie on the stand.

11:33.359 --> 11:35.566
You're asking me
to out and out participate

11:35.653 --> 11:36.939
in an extortion scheme.

11:37.030 --> 11:39.613
No, I'm not. No one has
to know you were in on it.

11:39.699 --> 11:42.532
She'll know and I'll know,
and I'm not doing it.

11:42.619 --> 11:44.656
Katrina...
Enough bullshit, Alex.

11:44.746 --> 11:47.033
I'd still have a job if Harvey
had shown me the respect

11:47.123 --> 11:48.329
to tell me about that deal.

11:48.416 --> 11:49.998
So, if you can't be
straight with me about this,

11:50.084 --> 11:51.415
you can get the hell out.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.995
All right. No bullshit.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.376
It's extortion.

11:56.466 --> 11:59.549
And if you don't want to, we
can try to find another way.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.843
But Faye is the one
who fired you, not Harvey.

12:01.930 --> 12:03.716
You know in your heart
he's sorry about what he did,

12:03.806 --> 12:06.343
and all I'm really asking you
is to speak your goddamn mind.

12:12.440 --> 12:14.351
What if it
doesn't work?

12:14.442 --> 12:17.025
Then we all go down,
because there is no way Faye

12:17.111 --> 12:19.022
ever believes all of us
weren't a part of it.

12:19.113 --> 12:21.696
What about Mike and Samantha?
Did you run this by them yet?

12:21.783 --> 12:23.820
I have. They're in.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.618
Well, then I'm in, too, and I can
get us the last person we need.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.490
HARVEY: Not the last person,
Louis. You heard the plan.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.618
There's one more, and
Alex is making that happen.

12:30.708 --> 12:32.995
But if this thing
goes south,

12:33.086 --> 12:34.827
the firm is done.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.457
So, I'm putting this
to a formal vote.

12:36.547 --> 12:37.708
I already said I'm in.

12:37.799 --> 12:39.915
As far as I'm concerned, this
should've been done months ago.

12:41.052 --> 12:43.043
Then it's settled.
One more thing.

12:43.137 --> 12:45.344
We're all that's left
of Pearson Hardman.

12:45.431 --> 12:47.172
If this turns out
to be the end,

12:47.267 --> 12:50.805
I want you both to know there's no
one I'd rather have by my side than you.

12:58.403 --> 13:00.770
Gretchen, you alone?
GRETCHEN: Not anymore.

13:01.531 --> 13:02.737
Louis,
what are you doing here?

13:02.824 --> 13:04.155
I'm here
because we have a plan

13:04.242 --> 13:05.983
to get Faye out of our lives
once and for all,

13:06.077 --> 13:07.192
and we need your help,

13:07.287 --> 13:08.903
but it's not just risking
your job this time.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.704
It can constitute perjury
which means...

13:10.790 --> 13:13.623
Louis, I've been working in law
firms since you were in diapers.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.246
I know what it means,

13:15.336 --> 13:17.668
and whateveritis, I'm in.

13:18.464 --> 13:20.705
Are you sure? When I first
came to work on your desk,

13:20.800 --> 13:21.790
I thought to myself,

13:21.884 --> 13:24.672
"I can't spend another second
with this lunatic."

13:25.138 --> 13:26.799
Don't get me wrong,
you're still a lunatic,

13:26.889 --> 13:29.347
but this all goes to shit,
so be it

13:29.434 --> 13:31.425
'cause I know
whose team I'm on.

13:32.854 --> 13:33.844
Then let's get
the hell out of here,

13:33.938 --> 13:35.269
so I can take you
out to dinner as colleagues.

13:35.398 --> 13:37.765
Louis, you don't have to
do that. Yeah, Gretchen, I do.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.897
Because after tomorrow, we
might not be colleagues anymore.

13:45.992 --> 13:48.233
Alex take care of it?

13:48.328 --> 13:49.443
He did.

13:52.332 --> 13:53.572
Harvey, what's going on?

13:53.666 --> 13:55.623
Nothing, it's just
a lot of people

13:55.710 --> 13:57.326
are putting themselves
on the line for this,

13:57.420 --> 14:01.004
and the train is moving, but
it hasn't left the station yet.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.206
I don't understand. Are you
looking for me to stop you?

14:03.718 --> 14:07.962
It's just I know you've
always been my compass.

14:09.557 --> 14:12.094
And I need to be sure
that you're really on board.

14:12.185 --> 14:14.643
Listen to me.
I know who I'm with.

14:16.481 --> 14:18.813
And I don't wanna change you.
I wanna be with you.

14:18.900 --> 14:21.392
But if this is about everybody
else, and you're still not sure,

14:21.486 --> 14:24.069
then the train doesn't really
leave the station until tomorrow.

14:25.239 --> 14:27.697
Then there's one more thing.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.741
I have an ace in the hole,

14:29.827 --> 14:32.694
but I don't wanna play it
unless you're good with it, too.

14:40.088 --> 14:42.830
Katrina, you're not permitted to
be here. This won't take long, Faye.

14:42.924 --> 14:46.883
I just wanted to let you know
that if Harvey testifies tomorrow,

14:46.969 --> 14:47.959
so will I.

14:48.304 --> 14:49.294
Excuse me?

14:49.389 --> 14:51.221
I've been called as a witness
for the plaintiff,

14:51.307 --> 14:54.470
and I plan to tell that jury
exactly why I was fired.

14:54.602 --> 14:57.060
So what? You were fired
for cause. That's your story.

14:57.146 --> 15:00.229
Mine is that you asked me to use
my friendship with the other side,

15:00.316 --> 15:02.853
and when I refused,
you got rid of me.

15:02.944 --> 15:04.651
That's a lie.
It's also the third time

15:04.737 --> 15:06.273
you'll be accused
of wrongful termination.

15:06.364 --> 15:08.526
Only this time, it's a crime.

15:08.616 --> 15:10.527
Then go ahead.
Nobody will believe you.

15:10.618 --> 15:12.029
I think they will,

15:12.120 --> 15:14.737
because they're going to ask
me if on your second day here,

15:14.831 --> 15:16.663
you approached me
to undercut Samantha.

15:17.083 --> 15:21.202
Then they're going to ask if you came
to Alex Williams to spy on Samantha.

15:21.295 --> 15:24.788
And the last thing they're going
to ask is if I'm so untrustworthy,

15:24.882 --> 15:29.092
then why did you specifically choose
me to write the firm's code of conduct?

15:29.345 --> 15:31.336
I thought you were better
than the rest of them.

15:31.431 --> 15:33.718
And you think
you're better than everyone.

15:35.435 --> 15:36.550
It's up to you, Faye.

15:36.644 --> 15:41.059
But like I said, if Harvey
testifies, then so do I.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.529
You put them
up to this, didn't you?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.821
Put who up to what?

15:50.908 --> 15:52.569
All right, you wanna
play that game.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.742
Katrina Bennett
marched into my office

15:54.829 --> 15:56.991
threatening to make it
look like I crossed a line

15:57.081 --> 15:58.867
to win this case
if I go make you testify.

15:58.958 --> 16:01.700
So, don't tell me
you didn't put her up to this.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.627
Sounds to me like she did it
because she can't stand you.

16:04.714 --> 16:07.376
Don't bullshit me, Harvey.
I'm not bullshitting.

16:07.467 --> 16:09.424
I didn't go see
Katrina about anything.

16:09.510 --> 16:12.673
You're parsing your words.
Someone did it, and they did it for you.

16:12.763 --> 16:14.549
Okay, Faye,
you want a direct statement?

16:14.640 --> 16:16.426
I had nothing
to do with this.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.849
Then prove it
by quashing this testimony.

16:18.936 --> 16:20.176
You want to run that
by me again?

16:20.271 --> 16:21.761
I called for
a one-day continuance,

16:21.856 --> 16:25.224
and I want her off that witness
list before you take the stand.

16:25.318 --> 16:28.185
All right, you want me to do this?
Then you're gonna do something for me.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.236
Like what?
What I should have had you do

16:30.323 --> 16:32.940
the second I entered
into this nightmare.

16:33.034 --> 16:36.277
You're going to put our
entire agreement in writing

16:36.370 --> 16:39.533
because I'm not letting you move
the goalposts another fucking inch.

16:39.624 --> 16:42.207
I haven't moved
anything anywhere.

16:42.293 --> 16:46.412
Now, who's bullshitting, Faye?
Take it, or leave it.

16:48.007 --> 16:50.339
Type up the agreement.
I'll sign it tomorrow.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.592
What was that?

16:56.682 --> 16:58.764
Faye's moving
faster than I thought.

17:09.111 --> 17:10.101
What's going on here?

17:10.195 --> 17:12.233
This was supposed
to be between me and you.

17:12.323 --> 17:14.314
No, Faye, this is
between you and the firm.

17:14.407 --> 17:17.526
And Harvey's not doing anything
without all of us here to witness it.

17:17.869 --> 17:20.453
So, you're going to sign that agreement
and you're gonna pack your bags,

17:20.540 --> 17:21.780
and I never want
to see you again.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.536
I'm not packing anything
until the jury returns a verdict.

17:24.627 --> 17:26.789
So, let's sign this thing
and get it over with

17:26.878 --> 17:29.246
because you have
some testimony to prepare.

17:29.340 --> 17:31.172
LOUIS: Give it
to her, Gretchen.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.799
Okay, everything looks in
order. MIKE: The hell it does.

17:37.890 --> 17:40.177
Your lawyer tampered
with my goddamn witness.

17:40.268 --> 17:42.134
Bullshit, I didn't
tamper with anyone.

17:42.228 --> 17:44.595
You gonna say you didn't
anonymously send Katrina

17:44.689 --> 17:46.805
the criminal code for perjury
to intimidate her?

17:46.899 --> 17:48.856
God damn it, did you
play dirty in my name?

17:48.943 --> 17:51.150
Because if you did, I...
You won't do shit, Faye.

17:51.237 --> 17:54.070
All I did was stop her from
testifying like you asked.

17:54.156 --> 17:55.396
You asked him
to go to my witness?

17:55.491 --> 17:57.277
Don't you dare
try to twist this.

17:57.368 --> 17:58.654
SAMANTHA: We're not
twisting anything.

17:58.744 --> 18:02.578
And when you call Harvey to
the stand, I'll ask one question.

18:02.790 --> 18:06.749
Did you tell him to shut down
Katrina Bennett, or not?

18:06.836 --> 18:09.954
And then we'll ask if you
convinced Katrina to perjure herself.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.253
You fucking coward.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.671
She's got you so wrapped
around her finger...

18:12.758 --> 18:14.169
The fuck did you
just say to me?

18:14.260 --> 18:15.375
SAMANTHA: Hey! Back the hell
off my lawyer!

18:15.469 --> 18:18.552
I'm not backing off anything.
Least of all, this little piece of shit.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.171
Enough!

18:20.850 --> 18:24.718
You lay another finger
on anyone in my firm,

18:24.812 --> 18:26.519
and you'll be up
for assault charges.

18:26.606 --> 18:29.314
And if you two don't get out
of here inside five seconds,

18:29.400 --> 18:31.732
I'm telling the judge you
came in here to get a mistrial.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.184
You heard the woman.
Get the hell out.

18:36.907 --> 18:38.318
You know what?

18:38.409 --> 18:41.572
You people make me sick, and I
can't wait to put you all behind me.

18:45.249 --> 18:47.411
LOUIS: Then don't wait, Faye.
Get the hell out right now.

18:47.501 --> 18:49.708
Excuse me?
He said you're done here.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.536
ALEX: Because that document
you just put your name to?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.747
Gretchen switched it
on your ass during the fight.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.548
And it's now an order
for Harvey to witness tamper

18:55.635 --> 18:56.841
by any means necessary.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.713
I get it.
You think you set me up.

18:58.804 --> 19:00.966
ALEX: No, Faye,
we did set you up.

19:01.057 --> 19:04.345
Because first, you ordered
Katrina to fire Samantha,

19:04.435 --> 19:06.642
and then you ordered me
to witness tamper.

19:06.729 --> 19:08.185
Well, I don't care
what you had me sign.

19:08.272 --> 19:09.979
No one's gonna believe
you didn't trick me.

19:10.066 --> 19:12.728
We think they will because
Katrina came to see you last night,

19:12.818 --> 19:14.650
and there's record of it
in the lobby downstairs.

19:14.737 --> 19:16.728
And after she did,
you went to see Harvey,

19:16.822 --> 19:18.358
and there's a record
of that, too.

19:18.449 --> 19:20.861
And when I refused
contact with Katrina,

19:20.951 --> 19:22.988
you called Gretchen
into your office

19:23.079 --> 19:24.820
and had her
send the criminal code

19:24.914 --> 19:26.700
to intimidate her
out of testifying.

19:28.459 --> 19:29.790
This is bullshit.

19:29.877 --> 19:31.038
It may be bullshit,

19:31.128 --> 19:34.746
but to a jury, it's gonna look
like a hot fudge sundae.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.456
Face it. It's over.

19:36.550 --> 19:38.882
You think you're going
to bully me into something?

19:38.969 --> 19:40.676
I don't care
if it costs me everything.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.800
I will never back down!
Damn it, Faye!

19:42.890 --> 19:44.551
I said never!

19:44.642 --> 19:46.053
Then you'll end up in prison.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.635
And you wouldn't have done
any of this if it weren't for him

19:48.729 --> 19:50.640
because he is a blight.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.723
He's a goddamn hero!
Okay, stop!

19:55.027 --> 19:57.610
Everybody, give me
and Faye a minute alone.

19:57.780 --> 20:00.067
Harvey, what are...
It's okay, Louis. I got it.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.460
What are you gonna do now?
Break my kneecaps?

20:14.547 --> 20:15.537
No, Faye.

20:15.631 --> 20:19.249
I'm going to give you the thing you
wanted since the day you got here,

20:19.343 --> 20:21.835
but not the way
you wanted it.

20:29.019 --> 20:31.226
What do you think
is going on in there?

20:31.313 --> 20:33.179
It's hard to say.

20:33.274 --> 20:36.562
If I know Harvey, he's
pulling out all the stops.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.484
And that still doesn't mean
he'll be able to convince her.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.939
Louis, have a little faith. Has
Harvey ever let us down before?

20:42.032 --> 20:43.238
No, not when it
really mattered.

20:43.325 --> 20:44.656
And I'm not
about to start now.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.576
Wait, does that mean...

20:46.662 --> 20:48.494
That Faye's out?
It sure as hell does.

20:48.581 --> 20:50.822
Holy shit.
The firm is ours again.

20:50.916 --> 20:53.408
HARVEY: It is, Louis. She's
packing her shit as we speak.

20:53.502 --> 20:56.085
Well, then my first order of
business is bringing you back.

20:56.172 --> 20:57.207
ALEX: I second that.

20:57.298 --> 21:00.416
If for no other reason than for finally
giving Harvey what he's always had coming.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.841
Speaking of which, you're
supposed to pull your punches.

21:02.928 --> 21:05.545
I did. I can't help it if you're
as weak-jawed as Mike.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.346
Oh. You taking shots
at me now?

21:07.433 --> 21:08.468
It's what Harvey would do.

21:08.559 --> 21:10.470
She's right. I would.
I feel that.

21:10.561 --> 21:12.723
Harvey, I've got to know. What
did you do to get Faye to go?

21:12.813 --> 21:13.974
What do you mean
what did I do?

21:14.064 --> 21:15.930
I'm the best closer
this city's ever seen.

21:16.025 --> 21:18.357
I closed. Seriously,
Harvey, I've got to know.

21:18.444 --> 21:20.776
And I hate to tell you this,
Louis, but you never will.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.945
Harvey, come on.
Okay, you really want to know?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.693
I gave her Boardwalk
and Park Place.

21:24.784 --> 21:27.025
Oh, God damn it.
Harvey, leave him alone.

21:27.119 --> 21:28.735
I want to say something.

21:29.455 --> 21:32.243
Faye's gone because we all
risked everything for each other.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.699
It's what
we've always done.

21:35.628 --> 21:37.494
And we do it
for one reason.

21:38.547 --> 21:39.833
We love each other.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.669
And if that doesn't deserve
drinks, I don't know what does.

21:45.763 --> 21:47.003
ALEX: Amen to that.

21:47.097 --> 21:50.385
First round's on me. I owe
you all at least that much.

21:50.476 --> 21:51.887
Come on. Let's go.

21:56.357 --> 21:57.563
Gretchen?

21:58.150 --> 22:01.268
Tell them to go on without me.
There's something I need to take care of.

22:16.001 --> 22:17.366
Thanks for meeting
with me, Stan.

22:17.461 --> 22:20.704
I know it's late,
but it's about my wedding.

22:21.841 --> 22:23.502
Ah, I see.

22:24.844 --> 22:25.879
What is it?

22:26.554 --> 22:30.718
I've been wanting to ask you something
and I've been afraid, but I'm not anymore.

22:32.101 --> 22:34.342
Stan, I want you
to officiate my wedding.

22:34.812 --> 22:37.975
First of all, Louis, I
am touched... But?

22:39.400 --> 22:40.890
...this is the second time

22:40.985 --> 22:43.397
you've asked me to break
the therapeutic relationship.

22:43.904 --> 22:46.066
If I am to do this,
it won't be like before.

22:46.407 --> 22:48.068
I will no longer
be your therapist.

22:48.158 --> 22:49.444
I knew you were
gonna say that.

22:49.577 --> 22:51.818
Then why are you
asking me, Louis?

22:51.912 --> 22:53.823
Because you are not
going to change my mind.

22:53.914 --> 22:57.373
Stan, we were in the fight of
our lives for the soul of our firm.

22:57.459 --> 22:59.871
And the other night,
Harvey lost it at Katrina.

22:59.962 --> 23:01.544
Katrina, my protege.

23:02.047 --> 23:05.881
And instead of losing it back at him
or freaking out and making it worse,

23:06.802 --> 23:08.384
I calmed him down.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.552
You calmed Harvey down?

23:10.639 --> 23:13.631
Stan, I'm not saying
I won't need therapy again.

23:13.726 --> 23:15.683
Lord knows I will.
That's for sure.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.763
I'm saying I can find
someone else because

23:20.774 --> 23:22.890
I'm ready to
have you as a friend.

23:22.985 --> 23:24.521
Then,

23:25.446 --> 23:28.154
it would be my honor
to perform your ceremony.

23:28.240 --> 23:30.072
Thank you.

23:34.496 --> 23:38.114
When you think about it, as my friend,
you can still sort of be my therapist.

23:38.208 --> 23:40.745
Louis, let me be
perfectly clear.

23:40.836 --> 23:44.670
When I say 'friends', I mean 'friends'
as in, "I need help moving my piano."

23:44.757 --> 23:46.589
Whoa.
Back the fuck up, Stan.

23:46.675 --> 23:48.461
We just started being friends
two seconds ago.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.293
Find someone else to move
your goddamn piano.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.003
Are you gonna ask me to
pick you up at LaGuardia too?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.679
Feed your cat?
Wash your back?

23:53.766 --> 23:57.179
Louis, what exactly kind of
friends do you have?

23:58.228 --> 24:00.686
The best kind,
and you're one of them.

24:00.773 --> 24:01.979
(CHUCKLES)

24:02.650 --> 24:04.687
See you at the wedding.

24:09.615 --> 24:10.855
HARVEY: Louis.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.657
Harvey! Where have you been?

24:12.743 --> 24:15.326
The only two people in the wedding
party are you and Sheila's sister,

24:15.412 --> 24:16.902
and I haven't seen
either one of you all day.

24:16.997 --> 24:19.284
Louis, relax.
Everything's under control.

24:19.375 --> 24:22.458
Wait a second. Are you
wearing a morning coat?

24:22.544 --> 24:23.659
Of course,
I'm wearing a morning coat.

24:23.754 --> 24:24.994
Frankly, I'm disappointed
you're not.

24:25.130 --> 24:27.622
You didn't tell me to. I
thought it went without saying.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.956
"Cause this is just
a regular tux.

24:29.051 --> 24:30.541
You might as well
be wearing assless chaps!

24:30.636 --> 24:32.172
Louis, you're not
the Prince of England.

24:32.262 --> 24:34.299
No, I'm just someone who
regrets asking a complete slob

24:34.390 --> 24:35.425
to be his best man.

24:35.516 --> 24:38.224
If you really feel that way,
I can step down right now.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.675
Don't be ridiculous,
you look fantastic.

24:39.770 --> 24:41.932
Truth be told, I don't look
nearly as good as you.

24:42.064 --> 24:44.431
You really mean that? Of course
not. You look like Mr. Peanut.

24:44.525 --> 24:46.311
God damn it, Harvey,
I'm about to get married.

24:46.402 --> 24:48.860
The last thing I need is for
you to make me feel less than.

24:48.946 --> 24:51.233
Less than what?
It's an expression, asshole.

24:51.323 --> 24:52.859
You're gonna make me
feel shitty about that too?

24:52.950 --> 24:54.657
You make it happen?
Mission accomplished.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.199
What are you talking about?

24:56.286 --> 24:58.903
Sheila asked me to ask Harvey to
get you to freak out about something.

24:58.998 --> 25:00.079
What?
Why would she do that?

25:00.165 --> 25:01.371
Because if you're
freaking out on Harvey,

25:01.458 --> 25:03.324
you're not freaking out about
the fact that Sheila's sister's stuck

25:03.419 --> 25:04.830
on the LIE,
and I'm gonna fill in.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.285
So, this was just
to get me distracted?

25:06.380 --> 25:08.872
That's what a best man
does, Louis.

25:08.966 --> 25:11.333
Today, I'm here for you.
Whatever you need.

25:11.427 --> 25:12.838
I think I might cry.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.919
You better hold it together
another five minutes

25:15.014 --> 25:17.255
because it's time
we walk down that aisle.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.687
Don't get any ideas about us
doing this anytime soon.

25:27.776 --> 25:29.187
(CHUCKLES)
Now's not the time, Harvey.

25:29.278 --> 25:30.860
What better time is there?

25:37.703 --> 25:39.740
LIPSCHITZ: Sometimes,
you meet two people

25:39.830 --> 25:42.618
who were so perfectly
made for each other,

25:42.708 --> 25:45.166
it is hard to envision
one without the other.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.578
Each one
complements the other,

25:48.672 --> 25:51.790
such that they are as
important to each another

25:51.884 --> 25:54.592
as air and water
are to life.

25:58.474 --> 26:00.090
I have known Louis many years.

26:00.726 --> 26:05.220
We have been through thick,
thin, and everything in between.

26:06.148 --> 26:08.810
I am proud
to call him my friend.

26:08.901 --> 26:13.646
And when I met Sheila, I knew
she was the perfect fit for him.

26:13.739 --> 26:15.400
Like Cinderella's
glass slipper.

26:15.491 --> 26:17.027
Damn it, Stan, I told you
not to talk about that.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.358
Our sex life isn't up for...
Louis, it is a fairy tale.

26:19.453 --> 26:20.943
No one knows about...
Sorry. Carry on.

26:21.038 --> 26:23.780
As I was saying,
in this particular case,

26:23.874 --> 26:27.208
I would say there are
no two people on this Earth

26:27.294 --> 26:30.161
more made for each
other than... Oh, God.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.917
Sheila, you're not supposed to say
that until he's asks you to say "I do."

26:33.008 --> 26:34.373
Louis, my water just broke.

26:34.468 --> 26:36.709
Holy shit. Louis, stay
calm. Now's not the time...

26:36.804 --> 26:39.592
I've never been more calm in my
life, Donna. Stan, ask us if we do.

26:39.681 --> 26:41.388
Louis, do you take
Sheila to be your wife?

26:41.475 --> 26:42.465
I do. Sheila?

26:42.559 --> 26:43.890
I do.
Stan.

26:43.977 --> 26:45.593
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

26:45.687 --> 26:47.303
Harvey, Donna,
give me the rings.

26:47.397 --> 26:49.104
Sheila, let's get you
to that ambulance.

26:49.191 --> 26:50.431
You have
an ambulance waiting?

26:50.526 --> 26:52.016
Of course, I do.
She's nine months pregnant.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.772
I didn't want to leave
anything to chance.

27:00.202 --> 27:03.365
Louis, honey, I'm so sorry
I just ruined our wedding.

27:03.455 --> 27:04.445
Ruined it?

27:04.540 --> 27:06.656
Sheila, we just got married
and our baby is on the way.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.457
This is the best day
of my life.

27:08.544 --> 27:10.660
You really mean that?
Of course, I do.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.371
Our anniversary and our child's
birthday are gonna be on the same day.

27:13.465 --> 27:14.455
And look,

27:15.425 --> 27:16.836
our chariot awaits.

27:18.971 --> 27:21.338
Thank you so much, Louis.

27:21.431 --> 27:23.047
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

27:23.142 --> 27:24.257
I love you, Sheila.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.929
Come on,
let's go have a baby.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.491
(PANTING) Oh, my God.
That was so embarrassing.

27:41.577 --> 27:43.989
My water just broke
in our ceremony.

27:44.079 --> 27:45.444
Sheila, we have
been over this.

27:45.539 --> 27:47.200
It's wonderful.
What changed?

27:47.291 --> 27:48.281
What changed is I'm in labor,

27:48.375 --> 27:50.036
and you're just sitting there
doing nothing.

27:50.127 --> 27:51.913
We're in an ambulance.
What the fuck can I do?

27:52.004 --> 27:54.792
You can stab a fork in your eye
and show me we're in this together!

27:54.882 --> 27:56.623
I should have asked Stan to
come on the ambulance with us.

27:56.717 --> 27:59.550
Are you seriously telling me
that I'm crazy right now?

27:59.636 --> 28:01.218
Is that the intercom? I think
they need me in the front.

28:01.305 --> 28:02.887
Oh, my God.
This was a huge mistake.

28:02.973 --> 28:04.259
I think I might be
having triplets.

28:04.349 --> 28:07.592
Sheila, hey, hey, hey!
Look at me! I'm right here.

28:07.686 --> 28:10.974
I swear, 30 minutes tops
we'll be in that delivery room.

28:11.148 --> 28:14.391
Breathe, breathe, breathe.
Okay.

28:14.484 --> 28:16.191
That was a bad one.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.608
Any word?
What do you mean "word"?

28:23.702 --> 28:26.194
You want me to call Louis
while his wife is in labor?

28:26.288 --> 28:28.279
I'd rather call anybody else
about anything else.

28:28.415 --> 28:31.282
Harvey. No, Donna, he's
right. It's a stupid question.

28:31.376 --> 28:33.367
It's not a stupid question.

28:33.462 --> 28:36.295
We all just
don't know what to do.

28:36.381 --> 28:40.170
The only time I've been to a wedding
that got cut short, you went to prison.

28:41.136 --> 28:42.126
Nothing?

28:42.221 --> 28:44.713
Come on, that is some
A+ material right there.

28:44.806 --> 28:46.296
Is this thing on?
It's not that.

28:46.391 --> 28:49.474
It's just... Look at this.
Nobody's dancing.

28:49.561 --> 28:52.053
Of course, they're
not dancing. It's weird.

28:52.147 --> 28:53.729
It's like they have
nothing to celebrate.

28:57.152 --> 28:59.610
What do you say we give them
something to celebrate?

29:00.906 --> 29:02.271
Wait.

29:03.075 --> 29:05.316
What are you saying?
I'm saying I love you.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.900
And whether I knew it or not,

29:06.995 --> 29:09.362
I wanted to marry you
from the second I met you.

29:10.374 --> 29:11.660
Oh, my God!

29:12.668 --> 29:17.378
Donna Roberta Paulsen, will
you marry me right here, right now?

29:17.464 --> 29:20.502
Harvey, of course,
I'll marry you,

29:20.592 --> 29:22.082
but right now,
our families aren't here,

29:22.177 --> 29:25.135
and I don't have a
dress. It's... Wait, stop.

29:25.222 --> 29:28.510
You look beautiful. We can
do it again for our families.

29:28.600 --> 29:30.136
But...
If there's one thing I learned

29:30.227 --> 29:32.889
from my mom, it's that
I wasted too much time.

29:32.980 --> 29:35.392
First, not forgiving her.

29:35.482 --> 29:38.816
And then not admitting
how I feel about you.

29:38.902 --> 29:42.361
Well, I don't want
to waste another second.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.859
Please, will you
marry me today?

29:44.950 --> 29:48.238
What about rings?
We don't have any rings.

29:48.328 --> 29:52.287
You can find one for me,
but I have one for you.

29:54.960 --> 29:57.702
That's what was
in the envelope.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.503
What do you say?

30:00.215 --> 30:03.333
I say yes, Harvey.

30:05.470 --> 30:07.586
Yes.

30:10.183 --> 30:12.720
Everyone,

30:12.811 --> 30:15.143
I have
an announcement to make.

30:15.272 --> 30:19.516
As soon as we can write our vows,
Donna and I are getting married.

30:23.613 --> 30:26.150
I'd offer to officiate,
but I'm not licensed,

30:26.241 --> 30:30.280
and I just don't think we want to
open up that can of worms again.

30:37.753 --> 30:40.040
Jesus Christ, Louis,
you said a half an hour tops.

30:40.130 --> 30:41.461
It's been 32 minutes!

30:41.548 --> 30:43.038
Damn it, Sheila,
it's just two fucking minutes.

30:43.133 --> 30:44.999
Would you say that
if your face were on fire?

30:45.093 --> 30:47.255
Sheila, listen to me.

30:47.346 --> 30:51.214
This is just one more step
on our road to being a family.

30:51.308 --> 30:53.049
We overcome this,
we overcome anything.

30:53.143 --> 30:54.804
Okay, then get to
overcoming the paperwork

30:54.895 --> 30:56.306
because if I have to have
another contraction

30:56.396 --> 30:58.433
before I get an epidural, one of
us isn't going to make it, Louis,

30:58.523 --> 31:00.855
and it isn't going to be me!
Okay.

31:00.942 --> 31:01.932
Mr. Litt.

31:02.027 --> 31:03.734
Oh, thank God they called
ahead. My wife is in labor.

31:03.862 --> 31:05.603
We need a room, we need
it now. I understand that.

31:05.697 --> 31:07.779
Unfortunately, we don't have
any rooms at the moment.

31:07.866 --> 31:09.402
Wait, I'm sorry. What do you
mean you don't have any rooms?

31:09.493 --> 31:11.154
We're having a baby.
It's not going to wait.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.235
Sir, if you'll just calm down.
We will get you a room...

31:13.330 --> 31:15.913
Calm down? I'm supposed to be on
a helicopter to the Hamptons tonight.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.706
Do you know what the weather's
like in the Hamptons right now?

31:17.793 --> 31:19.409
Neither do I
because I'm not there!

31:19.503 --> 31:20.834
What I do know is...
NURSE: Mr. Litt?

31:20.962 --> 31:22.669
We need to admit your
wife right now. I know that.

31:22.756 --> 31:23.996
That's what
I'm trying to tell everyone.

31:24.091 --> 31:26.128
I mean we need to get her
to the OR immediately.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.630
The OR? Is something wrong?
There are some complications.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.587
Your wife and child are in danger.
Your wife's in a great deal of pain,

31:31.681 --> 31:33.137
and she's in no condition
to make a decision.

31:33.225 --> 31:37.310
We need you to give consent to her
going into surgery, and we need it now.

31:37.396 --> 31:38.807
Go. I'll sign
whatever you need.

31:50.492 --> 31:53.951
HARVEY: Love is a
terrifying thing. It's not safe.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.368
Because when you
love someone,

31:55.455 --> 31:57.321
you have to face the fact
that you could lose them.

32:03.422 --> 32:07.086
Sometimes life throws an
unexpected wrench in your way.

32:08.009 --> 32:11.172
It might be that you're in
jeopardy of losing your career,

32:12.222 --> 32:14.384
your freedom,
or worst of all,

32:14.474 --> 32:17.307
you might even find out
that a loved one has died.

32:19.438 --> 32:22.021
These things make you realize
how precious life is,

32:22.107 --> 32:24.724
how important every second
we have on this Earth is,

32:24.818 --> 32:28.106
and how important the people
we care about are to us.

32:35.996 --> 32:37.486
Donna,

32:38.498 --> 32:43.083
I kept my feelings inside for
so long because I was afraid.

32:43.170 --> 32:45.002
But when I finally
got good news,

32:45.088 --> 32:48.171
that's when I knew
you were my everything.

32:48.258 --> 32:51.091
I knew I could always count on
you when the chips were down.

32:51.178 --> 32:54.716
I just hadn't realized I couldn't
do without you when they were up.

32:55.599 --> 32:57.260
I'm a gambler.

32:57.350 --> 33:00.638
I always have been,
and I always will be.

33:00.729 --> 33:04.973
When you're with me,
my chips are always up.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.896
DONNA: None of us know
how much time we really have.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.825
It could be a minute. It could
be an hour. It could be 50 years.

33:16.912 --> 33:22.157
But I know even if it's 100 years,
I'll never have enough time with you.

33:25.587 --> 33:26.577
(CRYING)

33:28.882 --> 33:32.295
LIPSCHITZ: From the day
we are born, we look for love.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.798
Because it is love
that nourishes our soul.

33:37.974 --> 33:42.764
And when we are lucky enough to
find it, our lives are changed forever.

33:46.274 --> 33:48.686
Mr. Litt?
Please tell me.

33:48.777 --> 33:50.108
I have great news.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.937
Both mother and daughter
are doing fine.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.194
Daughter?

33:56.284 --> 33:59.197
Yes, you have
a beautiful baby girl.

33:59.287 --> 34:01.198
Six pounds, eight ounces.

34:04.167 --> 34:05.783
(LAUGHING TEARFULLY)

34:07.629 --> 34:09.040
(SNIFFLING)

34:09.130 --> 34:10.962
Thank you.

34:11.257 --> 34:12.918
You make me laugh.

34:14.094 --> 34:16.210
You make me cry.

34:17.304 --> 34:19.512
You make me crazy.

34:20.934 --> 34:23.641
But most of all, Harvey,
you make me happy.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.145
Without you, I'm empty.

34:33.362 --> 34:35.980
I can never go back
to the way I was before.

34:37.242 --> 34:40.576
You've changed me, and
you've changed my life forever.

34:40.661 --> 34:42.402
I love you, Harvey Specter.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.659
I love you, Donna Paulsen.

34:45.125 --> 34:46.991
Do you, Harvey Specter,

34:47.085 --> 34:49.292
take Donna Paulsen to be
your lawfully wedded wife?

34:49.588 --> 34:50.703
I do.

34:50.797 --> 34:51.958
Do you, Donna Paulsen,

34:52.047 --> 34:54.960
take Harvey Specter to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

34:55.051 --> 34:56.132
I do.

34:56.219 --> 34:59.052
Then I now pronounce you
man and wife.

34:59.139 --> 35:01.050
You may kiss the bride.

35:06.605 --> 35:08.312
(GUESTS APPLAUDING)

35:15.238 --> 35:18.572
And to add to the good news,
I just heard from Louis.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.615
He's the proud father
of a beautiful baby girl.

35:20.702 --> 35:22.067
(ALL CHEERING)

35:23.163 --> 35:25.575
Harvey, I want to go
see Louis. And we will.

35:25.665 --> 35:28.407
But right now,
I want to dance with my wife.

36:40.949 --> 36:41.939
Mr. Litt?

36:42.617 --> 36:46.076
Your wife's still in recovery, but
would you like to hold your girl?

36:46.162 --> 36:48.870
Of course.
There you go.

36:49.249 --> 36:51.115
Hi.
(BABY COOING)

36:51.209 --> 36:53.041
Hi.

36:55.547 --> 36:57.129
Welcome to the world.

36:58.925 --> 37:00.211
I'm Dada.

37:00.301 --> 37:03.919
And I know it was a bumpy
start, but if one thing is for sure,

37:05.056 --> 37:06.922
I'm always gonna love you.

37:07.100 --> 37:08.807
Do you have a name?

37:09.644 --> 37:10.634
Lucy.

37:10.729 --> 37:13.312
Our daughter's name is Lucy.
Are you sure?

37:13.398 --> 37:15.139
Do you wanna wait to
double-check with your wife?

37:15.233 --> 37:16.644
No, it's what
we both wanted.

37:16.735 --> 37:18.976
There was a phase
when we thought about Endora,

37:19.070 --> 37:21.027
but we came to our senses.
Endora?

37:21.114 --> 37:22.400
We're big fans of Bewitched.

37:22.490 --> 37:24.322
But wasn't she the bad guy?
She knew who she was.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.695
I've been up all night.
Can we just drop it?

37:25.785 --> 37:27.446
DONNA: Hi, Daddy.

37:27.537 --> 37:30.154
Is that her?
Yes.

37:30.248 --> 37:33.786
Can I hold her?
Yes. Donna, this is Lucy.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.959
Hi, sweetheart.

37:37.046 --> 37:40.414
Nice to meet you.
Congratulations.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.624
DONNA: We are gonna have
so much fun together.

37:42.802 --> 37:43.917
(LUCY WHINES)
Oh!

37:44.012 --> 37:45.628
Are you hungry?

37:46.097 --> 37:47.929
It's time for me
to take her back.

37:48.016 --> 37:49.006
Oh...

37:49.267 --> 37:52.726
That's okay. We'll have
plenty of time to get to know her.

37:54.063 --> 37:57.522
We will, Louis, but not
exactly how you think.

37:57.609 --> 37:59.225
Because we have
some news, too.

37:59.319 --> 38:02.687
I know, you guys got married,
too. I heard. Congratulations.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.442
That's not
all of it, Louis.

38:05.909 --> 38:09.197
Donna and I talked it over,
and we're leaving the firm.

38:09.287 --> 38:10.277
What?

38:10.371 --> 38:12.783
We're going to Seattle
to work with Mike and Rachel.

38:12.874 --> 38:14.239
No, you can't do that.

38:14.334 --> 38:15.495
Louis...
Wait a second, Harvey.

38:15.585 --> 38:16.791
Is this what you did
to close Faye?

38:16.878 --> 38:18.835
Because she's gone now.
She can't stop you from...

38:18.922 --> 38:22.586
It is what he told Faye, Louis.
But it's what we want. Both of us.

38:22.675 --> 38:24.837
Bullshit, you've never wanted
to play in the B leagues.

38:24.928 --> 38:27.010
HARVEY: Louis, if there's
one thing that Faye did for me,

38:27.096 --> 38:29.258
it's remind me of who I am.

38:29.349 --> 38:32.808
I like crossing lines.
I like playing in the gray.

38:32.894 --> 38:35.056
But what Mike showed me,

38:35.146 --> 38:38.059
I want to do it for the
good guys for a change.

38:40.443 --> 38:43.185
You said
you'd always be there.

38:43.279 --> 38:44.861
You said you'd never leave.

38:44.948 --> 38:47.656
I meant we'd be there
for as long as you needed us.

38:49.786 --> 38:51.493
You don't need us anymore.

38:51.579 --> 38:55.322
And no matter where we are,
we'll always be your family.

38:56.459 --> 38:57.824
Promise?

38:59.087 --> 39:01.169
We promise. Come here.

look who's calling.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.179
Guess where
I'm sitting right now.

39:15.270 --> 39:18.854
Back in your old office?
Back in Faye's old office.

39:18.940 --> 39:20.806
Which just happens
to be my old office.

39:20.900 --> 39:23.107
Now that you mention it,
I guess it is.

39:23.194 --> 39:25.481
I always knew you were
out to get me. (CHUCKLES)

39:26.030 --> 39:28.488
It's called the long
con, Robert. Uh-huh.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.492
Congratulations, Samantha.
Use it well.

39:32.579 --> 39:33.785
I will, Robert.

39:34.289 --> 39:35.950
I will.

39:37.500 --> 39:41.038
Hey, shouldn't you be
at the hospital?

39:41.129 --> 39:43.245
Sheila's taking a nap.

39:43.339 --> 39:46.331
It's a good thing you're sitting
down because I have some news.

39:46.426 --> 39:49.589
Is it about Harvey and Donna?
Because I already know.

39:49.846 --> 39:52.053
It is.
It's a lot to lose.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.097
I know.
Here's what I also know.

39:54.183 --> 39:55.924
If I were ever
backed into a corner,

39:56.019 --> 39:58.602
there's no one I'd rather
have by my side than you.

39:58.688 --> 40:00.019
What are you saying?

40:00.106 --> 40:02.143
I'm saying I need you
to be my Harvey.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.735
Well, I can't be
your Harvey, Louis,

40:07.822 --> 40:10.063
but I can be your Samantha.

40:11.659 --> 40:15.072
And I'm gonna start with
putting two conditions on it.

40:16.748 --> 40:17.829
Of course, you are.

40:17.916 --> 40:20.908
First, we put it in the bylaws that
we don't change the name again

40:21.002 --> 40:22.618
for at least five years.

40:22.712 --> 40:24.498
And second?
Before we do that,

40:24.797 --> 40:27.334
we make one final change.

40:32.388 --> 40:33.878
Hey.

40:35.183 --> 40:36.844
What are you doing?

40:36.935 --> 40:40.678
Louis told me he did this with Jessica
the night before Mike went to prison.

40:41.064 --> 40:43.772
DONNA: Looked out on
everything they might be giving up.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.108
This is where it all started
for me and Louis.

40:47.195 --> 40:49.277
Not to mention for Mike.

40:50.657 --> 40:54.275
Are you sure you want to do this,
Harvey? Are you sure you want to go?

40:55.411 --> 40:57.072
I am.

40:58.623 --> 41:00.990
No turning back now.

41:02.627 --> 41:03.788
Good,

41:04.796 --> 41:06.252
'cause your new boss called.

41:06.339 --> 41:09.707
He'll be here in an hour.
Wants to have a word.

41:19.686 --> 41:21.768
Mike,
what are you doing here?

41:21.854 --> 41:23.640
I didn't think I'd see you
till my first day.

41:23.731 --> 41:25.597
Well, I'll tell you
what I'm doing here.

41:25.692 --> 41:27.854
You may be moving to Seattle,

41:29.070 --> 41:30.777
but you don't have a job yet.

41:31.239 --> 41:33.822
I get it.
You want to interview me?

41:33.908 --> 41:35.148
I don't see
another way around it.

41:35.243 --> 41:36.699
Otherwise, how am I
gonna know what I'm getting?

41:36.786 --> 41:37.867
You want to know
what you're getting?

41:37.954 --> 41:39.160
You're getting a guy
who doesn't like

41:39.247 --> 41:42.205
to hang out with people
that aren't that bright.

41:42.291 --> 41:44.578
You know, just to see
how the other half lives.

41:44.669 --> 41:46.706
All right, let me
tell you something.

41:46.796 --> 41:50.255
This isn't elementary school.
This is high pressure, long hours.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.002
I need a grown
goddamn man.

41:52.093 --> 41:54.835
I see you've got
a Barbri legal handbook there.

41:54.929 --> 41:57.762
Oh, this old thing?
Go ahead. Open it.

41:57.849 --> 41:59.635
Any page.
Ask me anything.

41:59.726 --> 42:01.216
You really want
to keep going with this?

42:01.310 --> 42:02.471
Fuck no.
I won't know a thing.

42:02.562 --> 42:04.894
Did you at least bring
a briefcase full of weed?

42:04.981 --> 42:06.392
No, but I know a guy.

42:06.482 --> 42:08.018
Coffee cart.
You got it.

42:08.109 --> 42:09.440
You're hired.

42:11.404 --> 42:13.896
You wanna go see him
for old times' sake?

42:13.990 --> 42:15.901
There'll be plenty of time
for that in Seattle.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.779
Well,

42:20.997 --> 42:22.579
I'll see you there, Harvey.

42:28.629 --> 42:29.664
Hey.

42:30.423 --> 42:32.209
Yeah?
You give me this chance,

42:32.300 --> 42:35.418
I promise you I will school
those Harvard douches,

42:35.511 --> 42:37.798
and be the best lawyer
you've ever seen. Okay.

42:37.889 --> 42:40.972
But you've got to lose the
fat tie. First impressions last.

42:41.059 --> 42:44.017
You get stuck behind a fat tie,
you're never gonna get out in front.

42:51.819 --> 42:54.811
Louis, they said
you wanted to see me.

42:56.908 --> 42:57.943
What are you all
doing here?

42:58.034 --> 42:59.775
It wasn't just Louis
that wanted to see you.

42:59.869 --> 43:00.859
It was all of us.

43:00.953 --> 43:03.035
And you're here because we
need to ratify the new bylaws,

43:03.122 --> 43:05.033
and we need all
the name partners to do it.

43:06.042 --> 43:09.706
I don't understand. You're
making me name partner?

43:09.796 --> 43:11.412
SAMANTHA:
What's not to understand?

43:11.631 --> 43:15.215
If it weren't for you, none of
us would be here right now.

43:16.844 --> 43:17.834
I don't know what to say.

43:17.929 --> 43:19.636
LOUIS: Say "yes", 'cause
we just put the new name up,

43:19.722 --> 43:21.508
I already agreed not to
change it again for five years.

43:21.599 --> 43:24.637
I got you new business cards. It
would be a really big pain in the ass.

43:24.727 --> 43:27.185
(LAUGHS) Then yes!

43:27.480 --> 43:29.471
And thank you It's an
honor. ALEX: Good,

43:29.565 --> 43:31.932
because it's gonna take all three
of us to keep this douchebag in line.

43:32.026 --> 43:33.232
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

43:33.319 --> 43:34.980
Wait, hold on a second.
It's Sheila calling.

43:35.071 --> 43:37.608
And I want a chance
to respond to that asshole.

43:37.698 --> 43:41.066
Hi, sweetie. How are you?
SHEILA: I'm good, Louis.

43:41.494 --> 43:46.079
I just wanted to let you know that
she's sleeping like the angel she is.

43:46.624 --> 43:47.910
I'll be there
as soon as I can.

43:48.000 --> 43:49.866
We'll both
be waiting for you.

43:51.087 --> 43:52.748
I love you, Sheila.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.129
I love you, too.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.600
DONNA: It's time, Harvey.

44:08.479 --> 44:09.594
You ready to go?

44:09.689 --> 44:11.305
You go ahead without me.

44:11.399 --> 44:14.437
They're packing up
the place tomorrow,

44:14.527 --> 44:16.768
and I need a little more time
before they do.

44:16.863 --> 44:19.946
I understand.
See you at home.

44:21.325 --> 44:22.986
Hey.

44:24.745 --> 44:27.237
You know I couldn't have done
any of this without you.

44:27.331 --> 44:28.913
Any of what?

44:29.542 --> 44:30.998
Everything.

45:34.774 --> 45:36.139
Whoa.
MIKE: You give me this,

45:36.234 --> 45:38.396
and I will become the best
lawyer you have ever seen.

45:38.486 --> 45:41.148
If you start behind the eight
ball, you'll never get in front.

45:41.239 --> 45:43.196
JESSICA: Some people
love the taste of blood.

45:43.282 --> 45:45.865
Better to find out who
you are sooner than later.

45:45.952 --> 45:48.865
Salieri, Mozart.
Are you wearing braces?

45:48.955 --> 45:50.320
Let me guess. You're Donna.

45:50.414 --> 45:51.404
Oh...

45:51.624 --> 45:53.661
You have no idea
how Donna I am.

45:53.751 --> 45:56.118
Yeah, baby! Butch
and Sundance are back.

45:56.212 --> 45:59.079
Anyone comes at you with
any threat at all, you come to me.

45:59.173 --> 46:01.540
You tell me!
You tell me everything!

46:01.759 --> 46:03.215
I'm a fraud.

46:05.888 --> 46:07.879
HARVEY: We're not just
colleagues or even friends.

46:07.974 --> 46:09.260
We're family.

46:13.020 --> 46:15.011
To Pearson Specter Litt.

46:15.481 --> 46:16.562
(MIKE IMITATES GUNSHOT)

46:16.649 --> 46:18.231
Life is like this,

46:18.776 --> 46:19.982
and I like this.
