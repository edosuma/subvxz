we'll all wind up guests

08:37.710 --> 08:38.993

That's why you're here.

08:38.995 --> 08:41.128
You keep her level.

08:41.130 --> 08:43.730
You apply your
theory selectively.

08:43.732 --> 08:46.132
You say that I lack emotion,
but she's<i> too</i> emotional

08:46.134 --> 08:49.101
and both are a problem--
you're inconsistent.

08:49.103 --> 08:51.136
Well, agree to disagree.

08:51.138 --> 08:53.037
All right,
it's time for the drop!

08:53.039 --> 08:54.171
Drop?

08:54.173 --> 08:55.472
Don't you mean "land"?

08:55.474 --> 08:56.639
Drug runners

08:56.641 --> 08:58.440
don't land-- we make drops!

08:58.442 --> 09:01.075

Ten seconds!

How will you extract his blood?
We follow him,

we bump him with a cane that
has a small needle on it.

11:22.989 --> 11:25.222
We prick the blood. Zoric just
thinks the cane banged his foot.

you test it

We were only supposed

We're gonna

13:55.835 --> 13:57.968
capture Zoric, I promise.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.036
First thing we gotta do

14:00.038 --> 14:01.771
is figure out how
to track him down.

14:01.773 --> 14:03.339
For that, we'll need wheels.

14:03.341 --> 14:04.840

I'm sorry, pal-- I gotta
be cruel to be kind.

14:16.685 --> 14:20.787
Other times, I think I'm close
to finding him, he ties

14:20.789 --> 14:24.190
loose ends, and he's off to
another country within 48 hours.

We must move fast!  WALTER:
Hey, you got to get

14:26.093 --> 14:27.926
the lay of the land
here in Havana so

14:27.928 --> 14:30.828
we know what we're working with.

14:30.830 --> 14:32.663
Are you kidding me?
This is slower than dial-up.

14:35.200 --> 14:37.967
Memorizing the Cuba
Reference Guide.

14:40.004 --> 14:41.169
SYLVESTER:
Okay, done.

14:41.171 --> 14:42.670
Havana has 15 districts,

14:42.672 --> 14:43.837
subdivided in 105 wards.

14:43.839 --> 14:46.340
He could be anywhere.

14:46.341 --> 14:48.842
Oh, a guy like Zoric wouldn't
hang his hat just anywhere.

14:48.844 --> 14:51.110
A genocidal maniac considers
most others inferior.

14:51.112 --> 14:53.245
He'd want a haunt
with other European ex-pats.

14:53.247 --> 14:55.347
Not too crowded,
lest he get spotted.

14:55.349 --> 14:57.182
Not too small,
lest he stand out.

14:57.184 --> 14:59.884
Okay, six districts
meet your criteria.

14:59.886 --> 15:01.685
For a quick escape,
he'd live near water.

15:01.687 --> 15:03.386
Okay, that narrows it down
to three neighborhoods--

15:03.388 --> 15:05.421
Alimar and Cojimar--
working-class enclaves.

15:05.423 --> 15:06.789
And Miramar--
upscale.

15:06.791 --> 15:08.423
Zoric is a man of luxury.

15:08.425 --> 15:10.258
Our best shot is Miramar.
WALTER:  Okay.

15:10.260 --> 15:13.011
So, he'll want
to change his appearance.

15:13.012 --> 15:15.763
His most distinguishing feature
is his beard. That'll go first.

15:15.765 --> 15:17.464
He'll most likely
cut his hair, dye it.

15:17.466 --> 15:18.865
PAIGE:
If you want it

15:18.867 --> 15:20.333

a do-it-at-home kit.

You use a pro.

Guidebook lists four barbershops
in Miramar.

15:24.938 --> 15:26.771

only two chairs.

15:28.776 --> 15:30.308
TOBY:
Is it just me,

15:30.310 --> 15:32.076
or is a barbershop
a hell of a good place

15:32.078 --> 15:33.444
to get a blood sample?

15:33.446 --> 15:36.313
CABE:
Okay...

15:36.315 --> 15:37.898
The Hague's on standby.

15:37.899 --> 15:39.482
They went ballistic when
I told them we were down here.

15:39.484 --> 15:42.952
If we get a DNA match,
they'll issue an e-warrant,

15:42.954 --> 15:45.154
and I'll arrest Zoric.

15:45.156 --> 15:47.856
And if things go sideways,
they never heard of us.

15:47.858 --> 15:49.424
What we expected.

15:49.426 --> 15:50.892

How comforting.

15:50.894 --> 15:52.894
It's been over an hour,
still no bad guy.

15:52.896 --> 15:54.495
Maybe we should
reevaluate our theory.

15:54.497 --> 15:57.431
Zoric might still be taking care
of business at home--

15:57.433 --> 15:59.433
making calls to the Ratline,

15:59.435 --> 16:01.735
destroying evidence.
Just give him time.

16:01.737 --> 16:03.036
How you holding up, Happy?

16:03.038 --> 16:04.404

when the time comes.

16:09.309 --> 16:10.908
CABE:
Okay.

16:10.910 --> 16:12.442
Looks like
the time is now, gang.

16:12.444 --> 16:14.811
Zoric is coming down the street.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.410
Doc, you sure
this stuff'll work?

16:53.412 --> 16:55.311
Yeah, as sure
as I can be with anything

16:55.313 --> 16:57.079
that I buy
in a Cuban pharmacy, but,

16:57.081 --> 16:59.181
in theory, the chemical
from the occult blood test will

16:59.183 --> 17:00.849
turn blue
with any trace of blood

17:00.851 --> 17:02.851
from the jar,
without compromising it.

17:02.853 --> 17:05.186
Then we can isolate it
and run that DNA test.

17:05.188 --> 17:06.520
Anything?

17:06.522 --> 17:08.522
Nothing blue.

17:08.524 --> 17:10.524
This old coot's got
the hands of a surgeon.

17:10.526 --> 17:11.992
Not so much as a nick.

17:11.994 --> 17:13.526
Paige, turn the van on,
press the accelerator,

17:13.528 --> 17:16.128
then turn it off and floor it.

We can't shake the

17:37.881 --> 17:40.281
We just have to go in

28:53.928 --> 28:56.995
They're making
their initial breach now.

29:01.501 --> 29:02.700
Sonia,
why don't you come up here

29:02.702 --> 29:04.401
and sit next to me.

29:04.403 --> 29:05.935
I'm fine right here.

29:05.937 --> 29:08.671
It's not a request.
You don't trust me

29:08.673 --> 29:11.106
with the prisoner? This scum?

29:11.108 --> 29:13.108
Why do you care
if I kill him?

29:13.110 --> 29:15.977
You saw what he and his men did
firsthand.

29:15.979 --> 29:19.413
I saw what happens
when hate rules.

29:19.415 --> 29:21.114
And I don't want to see
that happen to you.

29:21.116 --> 29:24.684
And I don't want to see anybody
but Zoric in handcuffs today.

29:24.686 --> 29:26.085
So, please, kid,

29:26.087 --> 29:27.886
come up here
and exhale for a beat.

29:39.432 --> 29:42.032
I know they killed
a lot of people,

29:42.034 --> 29:44.667
but I know they didn't kill
the good in you.

29:44.669 --> 29:47.803
HAPPY: Cabe,
we're through the concrete.

29:47.805 --> 29:49.504
All right.

29:49.506 --> 29:53.040
We got to get in position
for when they get off that roof.

29:53.042 --> 29:55.442
Okay, now for chemistry class:
Ferric oxide

29:55.444 --> 29:58.411
and aluminum shavings
create thermite.

29:58.413 --> 29:59.979
Which, when ignited,
burns with heat intense enough

29:59.981 --> 30:02.047
to burn steel. Okay.

30:02.049 --> 30:04.916
Well, I've been working
with you guys for a while.

30:04.918 --> 30:06.484
I pick up things.
Okay.

30:08.488 --> 30:11.555
Okay, she's done.

30:13.025 --> 30:15.492
Good thing
I had a big breakfast.

30:15.494 --> 30:16.893
(exhales)

30:17.962 --> 30:20.662
(grunting)

30:20.664 --> 30:22.430
Come on,
put a little stank on it.

30:24.066 --> 30:25.665
Ooh!

30:26.501 --> 30:28.501
(groans)

30:28.503 --> 30:31.770
I am not a piñata.
Lower me down.

30:37.644 --> 30:39.877
Okay.

30:39.879 --> 30:41.578
Okay.

30:46.718 --> 30:48.784
(lock clicks)

30:48.786 --> 30:51.920
I'm in.

30:51.922 --> 30:53.054
Or not.

30:53.056 --> 30:54.455
There's another box inside

30:54.457 --> 30:55.923
with a high-tech thermal lock.

30:55.925 --> 30:58.859
We need Zoric's thumbprint
for access.

30:58.861 --> 31:01.027
CABE (over comm):
Problem is Zoric is passed out.

31:01.029 --> 31:02.695
And our pilot's entering

31:02.697 --> 31:05.998
Cuban airspace-- he lands in
40 minutes and waits for five.

31:06.000 --> 31:08.233
SYLVESTER: Bigger problem.
The bank manager is bringing

31:08.235 --> 31:10.468
a customer to the vault.

31:10.470 --> 31:11.669
What?!

31:16.075 --> 31:18.909
Don't worry; when I cut the
alarm, the whole system reset.

31:18.911 --> 31:20.477
He won't be able to get in.

31:20.479 --> 31:22.212
Okay...

31:26.952 --> 31:29.585
SYLVESTER: Unless he's doing
a manual override with his keys,

31:29.587 --> 31:31.720
which is exactly what it looks
like he's doing.

31:31.722 --> 31:34.022
So, Happy,
you have less than two minutes

31:34.024 --> 31:35.089
until you are caught
in that vault.

31:40.162 --> 31:41.227
Okay, pull me up.

31:41.229 --> 31:43.562
CABE (over comm):
Wait, we can't leave

31:43.564 --> 31:44.763
without that ledger.

31:44.765 --> 31:45.764
Okay,
that's easy for you to say.

31:45.766 --> 31:47.165
You're not the one about to go

31:47.166 --> 31:48.565
to<i> el</i> Prison<i> Fantástico.</i>

31:48.568 --> 31:50.534
We just need Zoric's thumbprint.
How do we get it?

31:50.536 --> 31:52.202
Easy. Chop off his thumb.
WALTER: No. No, no, no.

31:52.204 --> 31:54.537
Removing his finger
will stop the blood flow.

31:54.539 --> 31:56.772
No, the temperature drops,
and the thermal lock

31:56.774 --> 31:59.073
would read the print
as too cold-- t won't work.

32:01.610 --> 32:03.042
Holy bratwurst, I have an idea.

32:03.044 --> 32:04.943
Hold on, Hap, I'm gonna save you.
What?

32:07.047 --> 32:08.780
I'm dead.

32:08.782 --> 32:10.847
Hurry up, Cabe.

32:13.218 --> 32:15.751
Find anything useful?

32:15.753 --> 32:17.619
Yes.

32:17.621 --> 32:19.287
Just what we need.

32:19.289 --> 32:22.556
<i> Uno chorizo, por favo.</i>

32:30.232 --> 32:32.098
(door slides open)

32:32.100 --> 32:34.033
I have the sausage.
You have the fingerprint?

32:34.035 --> 32:37.702
(man speaking Spanish
on TV)

32:41.240 --> 32:43.974
(whispering): Guys, we are on TV.
WALTER: What?

32:43.976 --> 32:46.709
SYLVESTER: The authorities are
looking for us as we speak.

32:48.813 --> 32:50.546
Police are headed
right this way.

32:50.548 --> 32:52.047
(news report continues)

32:52.049 --> 32:54.649
The bank manager is headed

32:54.651 --> 32:56.584
straight to the vault,
with the keys.

33:06.161 --> 33:08.161
Who ordered the thumbrizo?

33:08.163 --> 33:09.662
Okay. Oh, yeah.

33:09.664 --> 33:10.863
Should be hot enough to mimic

33:10.865 --> 33:12.197
heat distribution over flesh.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.999
Happy... heads up.

33:15.801 --> 33:16.866
Okay.

33:20.605 --> 33:22.738
He's trying keys, guys.

33:31.782 --> 33:33.748
Okay.

33:33.750 --> 33:36.650
Okay, I got it.
Pull me up.

33:39.688 --> 33:41.788
(speaking Spanish)

33:47.128 --> 33:49.061
Hi.

33:49.063 --> 33:50.896
Have a sausage.

33:51.598 --> 33:53.998
<i> Policia!</i>

33:54.000 --> 33:55.966
(grunting with effort)

33:55.968 --> 33:57.600
Guys,

33:57.602 --> 33:59.101
we gotta get out of here.

33:59.103 --> 34:00.702
Come on, let's go.

34:00.704 --> 34:02.270
(sirens approaching)

34:03.706 --> 34:04.938
(tires screeching)

34:06.141 --> 34:08.374
Where the hell is he?

34:08.376 --> 34:09.942
There.

34:14.014 --> 34:15.346
(gasping)

34:16.615 --> 34:19.382
I hate it here!

34:19.384 --> 34:21.317
(gasps, yells)

34:27.124 --> 34:28.389
Pilot's on approach.

34:28.391 --> 34:31.024
Rendezvous point's
15 minutes away.

34:31.026 --> 34:33.026
At this speed we'll never make it.
I'm giving it

34:33.028 --> 34:34.794
everything she's got,
which ain't much.

34:34.796 --> 34:36.629
WALTER:
We need a shortcut.

34:36.631 --> 34:37.663
Sylvester, what did
the guidebook say

34:37.665 --> 34:38.730
about the island geography?

34:38.732 --> 34:40.331
Page 47, "Getting Around."

34:40.333 --> 34:42.266
"The old colonial byway,
which cuts across the island,

34:42.268 --> 34:45.402
provides a lovely rural tour
of Cuban farm life."

34:45.404 --> 34:46.770
Should be three
kilometers north.

34:46.772 --> 34:48.805
Hang on to your lunch!

35:00.751 --> 35:02.250
There's the plane.

35:03.987 --> 35:05.252
We're gonna make it.

35:13.228 --> 35:15.361
SYLVESTER:
Stop the car, he's getting away!

35:17.998 --> 35:19.397
By the time
I turn around in here,

35:19.399 --> 35:21.766
he's gone.
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

35:21.768 --> 35:23.234
We go after him, we'll miss
our one shot to get back.

35:23.236 --> 35:24.969
You promised me we'd get him.

35:24.971 --> 35:26.270
We have 23 of 24.
The greater good...

35:26.272 --> 35:28.038
Who cares about
the greater good?

35:28.040 --> 35:29.706
Guys, we all know
what the stakes are

35:29.708 --> 35:30.873
if we miss that plane.

35:31.742 --> 35:33.808
Okay, Sonia, let's go.

35:44.186 --> 35:46.186
<i> Policia's</i> coming. I can't wait
for these guys any longer.

35:46.188 --> 35:48.421
If you lift off without my team,

35:48.423 --> 35:51.791
I will never allow you to land
on U.S. soil again.

36:04.938 --> 36:07.972
You killed my family,
and now I can kill you.

36:12.044 --> 36:14.010
But I'm better than you.

36:15.313 --> 36:17.846
I have more humanity
than you ever will.

36:23.253 --> 36:26.120
I'm proud of you,

36:26.989 --> 36:28.788
But we still
gotta hustle.

36:30.792 --> 36:32.224
Let's go.

36:41.134 --> 36:43.767
(sirens approaching)

36:57.882 --> 36:59.114
(officers shouting in Spanish)

37:04.788 --> 37:05.920
♪ ♪

37:05.922 --> 37:07.421
FEMALE REPORTER:
<i> Zoric will face charges</i>

37:07.423 --> 37:09.089
of crimes against humanity

37:09.091 --> 37:12.225
for his role in the genocide.
A confiscated ledger has led

37:12.227 --> 37:15.094
to the search for 23
other Serb war criminals.

37:15.096 --> 37:17.430
Director of Homeland Security

37:17.431 --> 37:19.765
Adriana Molina authorized
the mission and will be meeting

37:19.767 --> 37:21.867
with the press shortly.

37:21.869 --> 37:23.335
Another day, not another dollar.

37:23.337 --> 37:25.136
But somehow,
I feel good about it.

37:25.138 --> 37:28.272
Maybe because
you're a decent human being.

37:28.274 --> 37:30.474
No, that's not it.
So, you yelling at me

37:30.476 --> 37:31.975
on the telephone pole--

37:31.977 --> 37:33.476
the whole exposure
therapy game--

37:33.478 --> 37:35.811
you were just trying to get me

37:35.813 --> 37:37.846
to admit that
I've fallen in love with Megan.

37:37.848 --> 37:39.414
Well, I have.

37:39.416 --> 37:42.450
Well, I'm sorry I was so tough
on you, but it feels good

37:42.452 --> 37:44.485
to say you love someone
out loud, don't it?

37:44.487 --> 37:45.853
You were a good doctor,

37:45.855 --> 37:48.088
you know that.
(chuckles)

37:48.090 --> 37:50.256
May I make another
observation?

37:50.258 --> 37:52.258
You took me on
as a pet project

37:52.260 --> 37:54.893
not because you had free time
since Happy put you on a shelf.

37:54.895 --> 37:57.128
You did it because
you were a child

37:57.130 --> 37:59.497
with two parents,
but you were still very lonely.

37:59.499 --> 38:01.832
And you can't stand
to be alone with yourself.

38:03.402 --> 38:05.502
How about you let me
be the doctor, okay?

38:05.504 --> 38:07.070
Fair enough.

38:07.072 --> 38:08.504
I'm off to see Megan.

38:08.506 --> 38:10.572
Knock her dead, meat.

38:19.015 --> 38:20.280
See you later, pal.

38:20.282 --> 38:22.348
Yeah, later...

38:25.019 --> 38:26.485
...pal.

38:27.921 --> 38:29.553
I would've killed Zoric
today if it wasn't

38:29.555 --> 38:31.154
for what you said to me.

38:31.156 --> 38:33.422
You saved me for
the second time.

38:35.025 --> 38:37.091
I don't have to be brave
anymore.

38:41.097 --> 38:43.363
I'll miss you.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.431
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

38:57.444 --> 38:58.576
Hey.

38:58.578 --> 39:00.978
Uh, a moment?
Sure.

39:00.980 --> 39:03.547
You've often said that
I need to accept emotionality.

39:03.549 --> 39:07.083
But high emotions,
uh, almost blew this case

39:07.085 --> 39:08.584
in the barbershop
and then chasing after Zoric

39:08.586 --> 39:09.851
was an emotional decision

39:09.853 --> 39:12.053
that could've
landed us in prison,

39:12.055 --> 39:14.588
so we're lucky
that it worked out

39:14.590 --> 39:15.922
the way that it did.

39:15.924 --> 39:17.156
You're right.
So what's the answer?

39:17.158 --> 39:19.291
Is it emotion? Logic?
It's frustrating

39:19.293 --> 39:21.626
that you seem to feel both.
It's frustrating

39:21.628 --> 39:23.561
you think it can be
solved like a theorem.

39:23.563 --> 39:26.363
Uh, let me tell
you a story, okay?

39:26.365 --> 39:28.264
When Ralph was three,
we got evicted.

39:28.266 --> 39:31.100
Our stuff at the curb
was picked clean.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.534
Logic dictated

39:32.536 --> 39:34.502
that I not cry in front of
Ralph, or I'd scare him,

39:34.504 --> 39:37.271
so I took his hand, we walked
for blocks with nowhere to go.

39:37.273 --> 39:40.641
Then I saw a diner with
a "help wanted" sign.

39:40.643 --> 39:43.210
I needed that job
more than anything,

39:43.212 --> 39:44.878
but if I had

39:44.880 --> 39:47.180
acted emotional instead of
composed during my interview,

39:47.182 --> 39:48.865
I wouldn't get hired,

39:48.866 --> 39:50.549
so with my last two dollars,
I bought Ralph an ice cream,

39:50.552 --> 39:52.552
and sat him in the booth
while I talked to the owner.

39:52.554 --> 39:55.888
I got the job, convinced
him of an advance.

39:55.890 --> 39:58.223
And that night, at a motel,

39:58.225 --> 40:00.592
once Ralph went to sleep,
you know, I...

40:00.594 --> 40:03.661
I cried my eyes out.

40:03.663 --> 40:06.997
Because that was the
right time for emotion.

40:06.999 --> 40:08.264
Do you understand?

40:08.266 --> 40:09.665
No.

40:09.667 --> 40:12.100
No, I-I wish that
there was a formula,

40:12.102 --> 40:14.635
like, uh, 90% logic,

40:14.637 --> 40:16.570
10% emotion.

40:16.572 --> 40:17.904
You're smart enough to know

40:17.906 --> 40:19.305
there isn't.

40:19.307 --> 40:20.606
Oh, and by the way,

40:20.608 --> 40:21.974
you didn't take
today's job

40:21.976 --> 40:23.475
for the greater good--
100,000 versus 24

40:23.477 --> 40:25.109
or whatever--
you took it because

40:25.111 --> 40:26.276
you saw a woman
in desperate need.

40:26.278 --> 40:27.977
Y-You took it
because Cabe

40:27.979 --> 40:29.545
asked us to, as our friend.

40:29.547 --> 40:31.079
You were affected...

40:31.081 --> 40:33.147
here.

40:33.149 --> 40:35.115
And until you
can admit that,

40:35.117 --> 40:37.217
you will never
move forward.

40:37.219 --> 40:39.652
Anyway, I gotta go
pick up Ralph.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.488
We're hitting Kovelsky's
for some breakfast.

40:42.490 --> 40:43.655
Breakfast?

40:43.657 --> 40:45.623
It's almost evening.

40:45.625 --> 40:46.957
I know.

40:46.959 --> 40:48.658
It's totally illogical.
(chuckles)

40:52.530 --> 40:54.062
Hey, Walt, you want to grab--?

40:58.034 --> 40:59.333
Damn you, Sylvester.

41:01.236 --> 41:02.401
Hey, Cabe,
you want to grab dinner?

41:02.403 --> 41:04.503
Why not?
I know a Cuban place.

41:04.505 --> 41:06.571
(laughs) How about a good ol'
American hamburger, huh?

41:06.573 --> 41:08.372
Even better.
Yeah.

41:08.374 --> 41:10.407
WALTER:<i> On the night</i>
<i> in question, Your Honor,</i>

41:10.409 --> 41:13.042
<i> I was uncharacteristically</i>
<i> affected by my emotions.</i>

41:13.044 --> 41:14.943
<i> As a result, I drove</i>
<i> in a negligent manner.</i>

41:14.945 --> 41:17.345
<i> So I plead guilty</i>
<i> and accept my sentence</i>

41:17.347 --> 41:20.014
<i> of community service.</i>

41:20.016 --> 41:21.949
TOBY:<i> I thought I was</i>
<i> tougher than this.</i>

41:21.951 --> 41:24.251
Since Happy put me on ice,
I've felt pretty rotten.

41:24.253 --> 41:25.485
Yeah?

41:25.487 --> 41:27.253
Well, that ought
to make you feel better.

41:31.592 --> 41:33.592
TOBY:
Uh, missed a piece.

41:33.594 --> 41:35.292
(Toby cackles)
Hey...!

41:38.096 --> 41:40.162
Hecklers.

41:40.164 --> 41:42.030
You gotta love 'em.

41:42.032 --> 41:44.565
Name's Ray.
Ray Spiewack.

41:44.567 --> 41:46.600
Uh... Walter.

41:46.602 --> 41:49.035
Oh, good on you, Wally.
Okay.

41:49.037 --> 41:50.102
Oh, man.

41:50.104 --> 41:52.604
Dead night crawler.

41:52.606 --> 41:55.173
It's a majestic creature.

41:55.175 --> 41:58.042
Aw, really bums me out to
see 'em dead like this, Wally.

41:58.044 --> 41:59.209
(deep sigh)

41:59.211 --> 42:00.310
You know, sometimes,

42:00.312 --> 42:02.178
I-I...
I just, I feel...

42:02.180 --> 42:04.713
too much.
You know what I mean?

42:04.715 --> 42:06.981
No.

42:09.618 --> 42:12.051
Yeah.

42:12.053 --> 42:14.119
Yeah, sometimes.
