10:53.742 --> 10:56.893
I mean, it's gonna be a hit
in the ratings, I promise you.

10:57.112 --> 11:00.480
But, I mean, given the,
uh, Lady Gaga make up

11:00.582 --> 11:01.714
and the muddy dress,

11:01.816 --> 11:04.918
I'm assuming there's some kind
of personal motivation here?

11:05.020 --> 11:06.603
Mm-hmm, well, I fell for it

11:06.688 --> 11:09.488
because Adam said that I won... me.

11:09.624 --> 11:11.023
Wow.

11:11.058 --> 11:14.659
Yeah, and then... light of
day changed his mind. [Laughs]

11:14.662 --> 11:17.947
Of course, I mean, I have,
like, a real guy and a real life,

11:18.066 --> 11:19.415
- and I...
- Who? Jeremy?

11:19.808 --> 11:22.441
Whatever, you can salvage that.

11:22.477 --> 11:24.127
I got to show you something. [Chuckles]

11:24.146 --> 11:26.146
Just hold on. [Chuckles]

11:26.248 --> 11:27.881
You think <i>you're</i> an idiot?

11:27.966 --> 11:30.817
[Chuckles] Wedding mags, all tabbed.

11:30.919 --> 11:32.452
It's humiliating, right?

11:32.538 --> 11:34.254
Quinn as the pretty-pretty princess

11:34.356 --> 11:36.455
- with her drug-addict, married prince.
- Mm...

11:37.426 --> 11:39.226
I mean, and then I found the fat jerk

11:39.328 --> 11:41.761
getting a blow job from Madison.

11:41.864 --> 11:43.831
And I really... I thought
I had him cornered.

11:43.916 --> 11:44.649
I did.

11:44.734 --> 11:48.001
But then that lucky bastard
found out and ran an end game

11:48.086 --> 11:50.437
and so now I am dead at the network,

11:50.539 --> 11:52.255
and, shocker, stuck here.

11:52.374 --> 11:53.840
Oh, well, no. I mean, maybe not.

11:53.942 --> 11:54.941
There's got to be a way to
show him up in front of Brad.

11:55.043 --> 11:57.677
I mean, we're talking about Chet.

11:57.763 --> 11:58.895
Right.

11:59.014 --> 12:01.114
- Right?
- Right.

12:01.200 --> 12:03.433
You think you got it all
locked up, but I heard

12:03.552 --> 12:06.186
that Adam was missing from
someone's bed this morning.

12:06.288 --> 12:08.622
ANNA: Oh, no, we talked about that already.

12:08.707 --> 12:09.756
Oh, really?

12:09.892 --> 12:11.057
He took a walk.

12:11.159 --> 12:12.692
He couldn't sleep
because he was so excited.

12:12.794 --> 12:15.979
And then he apologized for
not being there when I woke up.

12:16.064 --> 12:17.230
GRAHAM: I'll e-mail her.
Tell Paige I got mono.

12:17.332 --> 12:19.216
Send it to me. I promise you I'll sign it.

12:19.301 --> 12:20.467
What's up, Jer?

12:20.602 --> 12:24.204
Hi.

12:25.741 --> 12:26.806
Rach, what the hell?

12:26.892 --> 12:28.808
- I've been texting you like all day.
- I am so sorry.

12:28.894 --> 12:30.043
I-I-I-I did not mean to
worry you this morning.

12:30.145 --> 12:31.111
They just called me.

12:31.213 --> 12:35.415
It was like an early
morning prep session, but...

12:35.550 --> 12:38.184
I-I'm sorry about that note.

12:38.320 --> 12:40.053
What note?

12:40.155 --> 12:41.254
What did it say?

12:41.340 --> 12:42.923
Did you not get it?

12:43.025 --> 12:43.890
No.

12:43.992 --> 12:47.060
I-It was just like one of those, like,

12:47.145 --> 12:48.979
stupid, girly freak-out notes.

12:49.064 --> 12:51.231
It was stupid, but, um,
everything's fine now, so...

12:51.433 --> 12:53.333
[Chuckles] You're a freak.

12:53.435 --> 12:55.151
[Bell rings]

12:55.237 --> 12:57.437
MAN: Okay, let's hustle, people.

12:57.539 --> 12:59.756
Rolling in five.

12:59.875 --> 13:02.208
GRAHAM: Anna, Grace, welcome.

13:02.311 --> 13:05.211
<i>Soon enough, Adam
will drop to his knee</i>

13:05.314 --> 13:09.182
<i>and ask one of you the
question of a lifetime.</i>

13:09.284 --> 13:10.984
But first, joining us today

13:11.086 --> 13:15.288
is renowned San Francisco
wedding stylist Lydia Trask.

13:15.390 --> 13:16.122
Clap.

13:22.197 --> 13:25.532
Adam told me he's always wanted
a traditional English wedding,

13:25.667 --> 13:29.769
so I'm thinking Princess Di, Grace Kelly.

13:31.690 --> 13:35.141
<i>The dress should be
less about Adam's family</i>

13:35.243 --> 13:36.276
<i>and stuffy traditions</i>

13:36.378 --> 13:38.244
<i>and more about the new life</i>

13:38.347 --> 13:40.046
<i>that Adam and I are
gonna have together.</i>

13:40.182 --> 13:42.282
I've pictured this moment
for a really long time.

13:42.484 --> 13:44.150
You look gorgeous. Thank you.

13:44.252 --> 13:45.869
- [Indistinct conversation]
- Maybe...

13:45.954 --> 13:47.587
[Grunts] We have a problem.

13:47.689 --> 13:49.472
Just bring it in a little bit tighter.

13:49.591 --> 13:52.075
Tighter?

13:52.444 --> 13:54.694
How many times you gonna have
to barf to make <i> that</i> fit?

13:54.796 --> 13:55.795
Britney?

13:55.931 --> 13:58.496
What the hell... What are you doing here?

13:58.582 --> 13:59.983
QUINN: Rachel, why the
hell is Britney here?

14:00.001 --> 14:01.034
Get her out, please.

14:01.036 --> 14:03.169
This is your idea, isn't it?
She got cut after episode one.

14:03.305 --> 14:05.438
That's not... Britney,
you can't do that, okay?

14:05.524 --> 14:07.774
What is happening? Britney's here.

14:07.909 --> 14:08.858
Turn around.

14:08.944 --> 14:10.410
You're a producer, go figure it out. Oh.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.078
BRITNEY: <i>Oh, I love this one.</i>

14:12.180 --> 14:13.513
You can't just step onto my set.

14:13.598 --> 14:16.232
I'm sorry. You mean like your boss,
Chet, invited me to last night?

14:16.351 --> 14:17.484
Do you want me to go get him

14:17.586 --> 14:20.036
and explain that you're
trying to screw me over again?

14:20.155 --> 14:23.556
Chet? That's right.

14:23.658 --> 14:24.724
Chet.

14:24.826 --> 14:28.028
So, stop looking at me
with those watery turd eyes

14:28.130 --> 14:31.664
and get me a damn wedding dress, bitch.

14:37.094 --> 14:38.777
No! God, no, I didn't.

14:38.896 --> 14:40.996
Guys, come on. Why is
she touching the dresses?

14:41.098 --> 14:43.397
MAN: Copy. Oh, she's a
cheap stunt, not a bride.

14:43.432 --> 14:45.133
I mean, bringing back the
bad girl? They never win.

14:45.218 --> 14:46.318
[Sighs] She better not win, all right?

14:46.337 --> 14:49.504
Because that is a loose
cannon that we cannot control.

14:49.607 --> 14:52.507
I know, I know. It's Doodie
O'Clock. You got to make a big poop.

14:52.593 --> 14:53.709
- Britney?! Seriously?
- Right?

14:53.811 --> 14:56.645
'Cause we got to tease out
all the crazy for London,

14:56.747 --> 14:59.848
and I thought, "Let's do
something really Gonzo this season,

14:59.934 --> 15:03.402
totally left field, like
right field, wrong field."

15:03.520 --> 15:04.686
Come on, Bubba.

15:04.822 --> 15:08.156
Except for the fact that
we've already done it

15:08.292 --> 15:09.508
in three different seasons,

15:09.627 --> 15:12.294
so don't break your arm trying
to pat yourself on the back.

15:12.396 --> 15:14.246
We have?

15:14.465 --> 15:16.481
Yes, we have. I did not know that.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.166
I may have been high when I called her.

15:18.269 --> 15:21.470
You know that all that partying
is gonna kill you, right?

15:21.572 --> 15:24.473
Yeah, but what a way to go.

15:26.527 --> 15:28.810
You know, I've been...

15:28.913 --> 15:31.847
meaning to return this.

15:42.359 --> 15:44.960
You sure?

15:47.264 --> 15:49.948
Quinn.

15:50.067 --> 15:52.334
Look, even with all the
crap that we've been through,

15:52.419 --> 15:54.036
we still managed to make a show,

15:54.138 --> 15:58.040
so let's just make a great finale.

15:59.143 --> 16:02.945
Are we good?

16:03.013 --> 16:05.447
Always.

16:05.916 --> 16:08.717
Booboo... Booboo!

16:08.802 --> 16:11.787
- [Dog barks]
- Come on. Come on.

16:14.608 --> 16:17.726
[Sighs]

16:19.880 --> 16:20.696
So, let's cut to the chase.

16:20.798 --> 16:23.598
This is a television show, that's all.

16:23.684 --> 16:26.168
Do you think America's
gonna want to tune in

16:26.270 --> 16:29.938
to watch you and Anna-rexia paint a fence?

16:30.024 --> 16:32.007
It's just so boring.

16:32.109 --> 16:35.527
Pick me and we'll do it
till you're cross-eyed,

16:35.612 --> 16:37.913
and then when the show's
over and you break it off,

16:37.998 --> 16:39.414
the audience will be with you,

16:39.500 --> 16:42.884
'cause I'm just a
hot-bloode Latina temptress

16:43.020 --> 16:46.772
with a banging body and a sexy bikini line

16:46.857 --> 16:49.658
that will get a lot of exposure.

16:49.793 --> 16:52.894
[Sighs] Sounds intriguing.

16:52.997 --> 16:54.830
Mm.

16:57.217 --> 16:58.700
You already know what my mouth can do.

16:58.802 --> 17:01.870
Imagine what the rest of me feels like.

17:05.142 --> 17:06.641
That would be great. Thank you.

17:06.777 --> 17:09.778
Hey, I don't know if you
heard. Britney is back.

17:09.913 --> 17:10.746
As in Britney, episode one,

17:10.830 --> 17:13.749
she stuck her tongue down your throat.

17:13.834 --> 17:15.183
Oh, right, yeah, yeah.

17:15.268 --> 17:17.117
Right, so anyways, it's Chet's big idea.

17:17.221 --> 17:18.887
I'm just thinking that we're
gonna say something like

17:18.989 --> 17:21.990
you regret that you let her go so
soon, you love an underdog, and...

17:22.076 --> 17:24.159
Dude, please, seriously,
come on. We're stuck with her.

17:24.261 --> 17:25.292
Help me out. Yeah, no, no.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.260
I'll... I'll... I'll make...
I'll make it work, yeah.

17:26.346 --> 17:29.264
- [Sighing] Okay.
- Listen, uh, Rachel...

17:30.334 --> 17:33.335
I just feel that we
need to maybe, 'cause...

17:33.420 --> 17:36.903
Don't. It's okay. No hard feelings.

17:37.074 --> 17:39.074
Really?

17:39.176 --> 17:40.409
I promise.

17:40.511 --> 17:43.095
We have a wedding to plan in London.

17:43.213 --> 17:44.346
Yeah, no, absolutely.

17:44.431 --> 17:46.915
- Thank you so much.
- Yeah, I'm... I'm in, I'm in, yeah.

17:47.017 --> 17:49.418
Okay, so I just want to
assume that it's gonna be Anna.

17:49.520 --> 17:50.485
Uh, actually, um... Oh?

17:50.571 --> 17:52.454
I just had a candid
conversation with Grace,

17:52.589 --> 17:54.356
I'm starting to think I might
go with the other option.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.224
Yes, well, I called it, I
just want to say, day one.

17:56.310 --> 17:57.059
No, you didn't. The bikini model.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.910
She just... no, she accepts me

17:58.996 --> 18:00.846
for the selfish manwhore that I am.

18:00.931 --> 18:02.230
All right, that's okay.

18:02.316 --> 18:04.166
I will make sure that we
feature her moving forward.

18:04.268 --> 18:06.401
So we're okay? We're... we're good?

18:06.503 --> 18:10.539
We're 100%.

18:10.641 --> 18:12.808
Okay.

18:19.917 --> 18:20.615
ADAM: <i> Welcome back to the show.</i>

18:20.717 --> 18:22.384
<i>It's very nice to be back.</i>

18:22.519 --> 18:23.536
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:23.554 --> 18:25.754
<i>- Your hair looks different.
- Uh, it's called ombre.</i>

18:26.056 --> 18:30.325
I just found out that
Adam's picking, uh, Grace.

18:30.460 --> 18:31.225
- Huh.
- Mm-hmm.

18:31.295 --> 18:33.145
But I can turn Grace, too. It's fine.

18:33.263 --> 18:34.529
I think we're right on schedule.

18:34.615 --> 18:35.564
Okay, good. All right. How's this?

18:35.666 --> 18:39.468
<i>I'm completely lovable.</i>

18:39.570 --> 18:41.570
She's a train wreck.

18:41.672 --> 18:46.291
But she's <i> Chet's</i> train wreck.

18:48.645 --> 18:49.778
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

18:49.913 --> 18:51.963
Hey. This looks nice.

18:52.082 --> 18:54.900
- It's cozy.
- Mm-hmm.

18:54.984 --> 18:56.383
So, Adam told me.

18:56.487 --> 18:57.586
Good news travels fast.

18:57.721 --> 19:00.622
Okay, Grace, listen, I know
that you want to win the show,

19:00.724 --> 19:03.358
and I think... actually, it
would actually be really great,

19:03.460 --> 19:05.443
but I-I'm just telling
you this as a friend...

19:05.561 --> 19:07.461
Okay, the thing is that Adam is...

19:07.547 --> 19:09.697
Gonna propose to me and I'm gonna say yes.

19:09.766 --> 19:12.617
[Chuckles] Even though
he's sleeping around?

19:12.703 --> 19:14.469
Not a problem.

19:14.571 --> 19:16.671
Well, even though he's sleeping with me?

19:16.773 --> 19:22.611
We had sex last night... dirty sex.

19:23.747 --> 19:26.231
He almost left the show for me.

19:26.350 --> 19:27.315
But he didn't.

19:27.451 --> 19:30.585
Okay, look, I'm just telling you, okay,

19:30.687 --> 19:32.754
the guy is a manipulator, he is a slut,

19:32.856 --> 19:35.857
he is gonna end up humiliating
you one way or the other.

19:35.926 --> 19:37.959
But I do have a way I think
you could win and save face.

19:38.061 --> 19:41.046
See, the thing is, Rachel,
<i>you</i> 're a manipulating slut,

19:41.131 --> 19:45.000
and you'd happily humiliate me, I'm sure.

19:45.085 --> 19:46.301
Grace, that's not true.

19:46.386 --> 19:50.839
Yes, you would, Rachel, so
I'm gonna stick to my plan.

19:52.643 --> 19:54.543
JEREMY: On your mark.

19:54.645 --> 19:56.062
A pretty crazy season, huh?

19:57.164 --> 20:00.964
Yeah, I know, it was a...
that was pretty insane.

20:00.966 --> 20:03.517
Especially with having...
Mary, that was just the worst.

20:03.603 --> 20:04.735
Yeah, of course,

20:04.737 --> 20:06.971
but it's been pretty dramatic
lately, though, right?

20:06.973 --> 20:08.639
I don't follow.

20:08.724 --> 20:10.908
Last night, Rachel.

20:10.993 --> 20:12.277
She told me.

20:13.879 --> 20:15.011
She did?

20:16.251 --> 20:19.051
You're not gonna hit me right now, are you?

20:19.095 --> 20:20.362
Honestly, I wouldn't blame you,

20:20.364 --> 20:23.165
but if you can just wait till after
the wedding, then you can have at it.

20:23.201 --> 20:25.499
Won't be necessary.

20:25.598 --> 20:26.765
That's big of you, really.

20:26.830 --> 20:29.464
Honestly, it was just a fling,
and we got a little carried away,

20:29.565 --> 20:31.231
but we're never gonna run away together.

20:31.316 --> 20:32.449
Yeah.

20:32.568 --> 20:35.469
No, I-I... I get it.

20:35.571 --> 20:38.071
Guess we both dodged a bullet on that one.

20:43.121 --> 20:45.054
QUINN: So you told Grace
that you slept with Adam

20:45.057 --> 20:47.141
- and she still wants to marry him.
- RACHEL: Yes.

20:47.159 --> 20:49.093
Look I'm not done yet, but,
listen, say next season,

20:49.109 --> 20:51.059
this all works out,
we're in control, right?

20:51.061 --> 20:53.011
What about a show about men and women

20:53.130 --> 20:55.564
- who are like distinguished public servants?
- More candles, please. More candles.

20:55.649 --> 20:59.268
- Bored.
- They work at the Royal Ballet.

20:59.353 --> 21:00.986
Bored-er. All right, ballet?

21:00.988 --> 21:03.538
- They don't have boobs.
- Politicians. D.C.

21:03.624 --> 21:06.391
Yeah, D.C. is Hollywood
for ugly people, all right?

21:06.510 --> 21:09.528
Stop standing around! You
should be doing something.

21:09.730 --> 21:11.863
Fine. Fine. Okay, you know what?

21:11.949 --> 21:13.433
We keep the package exactly the same,

21:13.452 --> 21:15.669
but we just make a... a strong,

21:16.097 --> 21:18.781
completely enforced ban on all bikinis.

21:18.900 --> 21:20.066
Why are you standing around?

21:20.201 --> 21:21.667
You have a job. Do it. Ban on bikinis?

21:21.769 --> 21:23.703
- Yes.
- No, we'd lose our audience.

21:23.838 --> 21:24.970
We're not PBS, okay?

21:25.073 --> 21:28.040
Okay, you want something just
completely out of the box,

21:28.142 --> 21:29.108
super crazy?

21:29.243 --> 21:30.576
- Are you ready?
- Go.

21:30.662 --> 21:31.661
Wait for it.

21:31.746 --> 21:33.579
A show about women who have careers

21:33.715 --> 21:35.381
and actually talk about them.

21:35.466 --> 21:39.917
So, it's "The Apprentice"
meets "Everlasting"?

21:39.986 --> 21:40.435
That's not what...

21:40.621 --> 21:43.422
No, wait, girls have to compete
for a husband <i> and</i> a job,

21:43.458 --> 21:45.758
so maybe the suitor owns a company

21:45.860 --> 21:46.892
and he has to hire some of them.

21:46.978 --> 21:49.495
Come on, sleeping with your
boss is so hot right now.

21:49.597 --> 21:51.063
It's so not what I'm talking about.

21:51.165 --> 21:52.531
"Everlasting: The Whole Package."

21:52.633 --> 21:55.566
Pun intended. Come on. It's a great idea.

21:55.602 --> 21:56.801
- That's awesome.
- Here's your coffee.

21:56.886 --> 21:57.636
No, you're too late. I don't want it.

21:57.722 --> 21:58.421
So, the wedding, should there be one,

21:58.506 --> 21:59.672
will take place at my
family's ancestral home,

21:59.774 --> 22:03.158
which some might call a castle.

22:03.177 --> 22:04.243
Oh.

22:04.278 --> 22:06.078
Okay, that is a cut, everyone.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.246
Welcome to merry, old England, darlings.

22:09.249 --> 22:09.965
SAM: We are flying out tomorrow,

22:09.984 --> 22:11.183
so just get locked and loaded, okay?

22:11.185 --> 22:14.302
- MAN: You heard her.
- Hey, guys, travel just asked me

22:14.321 --> 22:16.254
if you want to share a room in London.

22:18.008 --> 22:18.974
Sure.

22:19.059 --> 22:20.942
Yeah, that's cool. Right, Rach?

22:21.161 --> 22:23.261
Come on, it'll be fun, right?

22:23.680 --> 22:25.230
Sounds like a blast, yeah.

22:25.349 --> 22:27.449
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Okay, cool.

22:33.140 --> 22:35.624
RACHEL: Okay, I went back to
Grace... That girl will not budge.

22:35.893 --> 22:37.060
She and Adam formed some, like,

22:37.162 --> 22:38.995
weird, non-American trade
agreement or something.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.514
I mean, no matter what we throw
at her, she's just not gonna do it.

22:42.599 --> 22:44.499
I'm just gonna get Adam back into Anna.

22:44.501 --> 22:47.235
There's just no way that she's
gonna put up with any of this crap.

22:47.271 --> 22:49.005
All right, you don't, and I'm swallowing

22:49.090 --> 22:51.290
a bottle of diet pills
as a gesture of dissent.

22:51.376 --> 22:53.309
I cannot live through
another year of bulimia

22:53.394 --> 22:56.395
and side-boob covered in glitter.

22:56.481 --> 22:58.247
You and me both. I'm on it.

22:58.333 --> 23:00.749
- Don't worry.
- You want me to try?

23:00.834 --> 23:01.583
I mean, 'cause it's not like

23:01.585 --> 23:03.118
he's taking girlfriend
advice from you at this point.

23:03.120 --> 23:04.988
You know what? I finally
found myself a ringer.

23:04.990 --> 23:06.539
If anyone can turn him, it's her.

23:06.607 --> 23:08.206
How we doing? Give me an update.

23:08.291 --> 23:10.090
- MAN: Got her.
- Wonderful.

23:10.108 --> 23:12.176
Ladies, we're gonna start
shooting in two minutes.

23:12.178 --> 23:13.544
Duchess Cromwell, hi, I'm Rachel.

23:13.579 --> 23:15.513
We spoke on the phone.

23:15.615 --> 23:16.881
I'm so glad you could make it.

23:16.983 --> 23:18.249
Couldn't get anyone else, hmm?

23:18.351 --> 23:20.034
I'm sure you must think

23:20.119 --> 23:22.086
all this last-minute wedding
stuff is incredibly crass.

23:22.221 --> 23:25.689
Please, I was snorting blow
off Mick Jagger's... you know

23:25.792 --> 23:28.692
two days before I married an
impotent duke for his title.

23:28.795 --> 23:32.062
Well, if that's the case, I think
you're really gonna love these girls.

23:32.165 --> 23:33.380
- The names...
- Ugh!

23:33.499 --> 23:34.632
I don't need names.

23:34.717 --> 23:36.267
Camera "A," eyes up.

23:36.352 --> 23:37.885
WOMAN: Copy that.

23:40.940 --> 23:42.406
Her royal highness,

23:42.542 --> 23:46.677
the Duchess of Sandwich, Camille Cromwell.

23:49.382 --> 23:51.765
Young ladies, please take your seats.

23:51.884 --> 23:53.651
I will join you.

23:53.736 --> 23:55.653
[Clears throat] Who is that?

23:55.755 --> 23:57.588
It's his grandmother. How do you know that?

23:57.723 --> 24:00.291
Slut.

24:01.327 --> 24:04.612
Who here has slept with my grandson?

24:04.730 --> 24:06.730
[Coughs]

24:06.833 --> 24:09.300
So, Granny, which of
these girls do you like?

24:09.302 --> 24:12.136
You just need a picture
bride, a Kate Middleton,

24:12.238 --> 24:15.139
someone to make pretty
babies and pose well.

24:15.274 --> 24:17.408
I think Grace is perfect for that.

24:17.510 --> 24:18.876
The Latin one? Adam.

24:18.961 --> 24:21.362
I know, but her father's a horse breeder.

24:21.480 --> 24:22.746
He's got plenty of land.

24:22.832 --> 24:26.015
- She's quite smart.
- Oh, she's delicious.

24:26.101 --> 24:28.219
I'm sure the two of you
have had a lovely romp,

24:28.304 --> 24:30.387
but we don't marry brown people...

24:30.489 --> 24:31.355
We just don't.

24:31.457 --> 24:33.490
What about the other
one, the porcelain doll.

24:33.492 --> 24:34.574
- What's her name?
- Anna.

24:34.593 --> 24:35.409
- That one.
- Yeah.

24:35.428 --> 24:36.727
She possesses one of
the most glorious traits

24:36.829 --> 24:38.562
few Americans have...

24:38.664 --> 24:41.131
She knows when to keep
her bloody mouth shut.

24:42.833 --> 24:45.100
And she seems to know
a bit about the family.

24:45.169 --> 24:47.421
Do you think they would like her better?

24:47.439 --> 24:48.939
If you want to get back in
the Cromwells' good graces,

24:48.941 --> 24:52.309
marry the little doll,
start popping out heirs...

24:52.394 --> 24:53.944
The whole lot will come running.

24:53.946 --> 24:56.380
Either way, it seems you might need this.

24:56.415 --> 24:58.265
[Snaps fingers]

24:58.384 --> 24:59.183
Wow.

24:59.318 --> 25:01.702
So, I can take this as your blessing?

25:01.787 --> 25:03.003
Just be thankful you're not getting

25:03.089 --> 25:05.522
some hideous, horse-toothed
cousin we foisted on you.

25:05.658 --> 25:07.791
Times have changed for
the better, my poppet.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.262
[Horse whinnies]

25:11.883 --> 25:15.351
GRAHAM: Today, here in this garden,

25:15.453 --> 25:19.972
Adam will propose to one
of our remaining ladies.

25:20.057 --> 25:23.325
Should she accept, she
will take her first step

25:23.428 --> 25:24.760
to becoming a princess

25:24.862 --> 25:28.628
as she weds Adam tomorrow
on live television.

25:28.630 --> 25:30.498
You know, I'm not in line
to be the prince or anything?

25:30.500 --> 25:33.284
Since when do we care
about facts on this show?

25:33.303 --> 25:34.537
Adam?

25:34.639 --> 25:36.972
- Enough talking. Get out there.
- He's coming, ladies.

25:37.058 --> 25:37.973
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you.

25:38.075 --> 25:41.327
Now, Adam, are you ready
to pop the question?

25:41.446 --> 25:44.313
After much consideration, yes.

25:44.398 --> 25:47.850
Each of you are so remarkable,

25:47.935 --> 25:51.153
and I can imagine my life with most of you.

25:51.239 --> 25:54.140
Well, here goes nothing.

25:54.258 --> 25:56.325
Grace...

25:58.529 --> 26:01.363
you know the powerful
connection that we shared.

26:06.504 --> 26:09.672
But I'm sorry, you're just not my wife.

26:12.443 --> 26:14.977
[Indistinct conversation]

26:15.079 --> 26:17.480
Anna...

26:18.816 --> 26:23.736
seeing you here today in
my country with my family...

26:25.656 --> 26:27.423
I realize how beautifully you fit in here

26:27.508 --> 26:32.628
and how beautifully <i> we</i> fit, and I...

26:32.730 --> 26:35.347
only hope that you feel the same way, too.

26:35.433 --> 26:37.666
I do.

26:37.768 --> 26:39.301
Good luck with that, Anna.

26:39.437 --> 26:41.270
Thank you.

26:45.510 --> 26:47.393
Camera "A," can you push
in on the royal bullshit?

26:47.512 --> 26:50.447
Camera B, please stay on Grace.

26:52.466 --> 26:53.682
QUINN: Okay, go, Madison,
get the interview.

26:53.685 --> 26:54.884
But I wanted to see the doves.

26:54.886 --> 26:56.402
Oh, they're not doves, they're
just pigeons painted white.

26:56.521 --> 26:58.204
Go.

26:58.223 --> 27:00.857
Anna Martin of Atlanta, Georgia,

27:01.459 --> 27:03.826
will you marry me and make me
the luckiest man in the world?

27:03.928 --> 27:06.462
Yes, of course.

27:06.564 --> 27:07.296
Yeah!

27:07.381 --> 27:09.265
RACHEL: That dress is amazing.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.901
- WOMAN: Oh, look at that ring.
- I love you, Adam.

27:12.003 --> 27:14.570
- And I love you.
- QUINN: Go, doves.

27:14.672 --> 27:16.906
Doves, doves, doves.

27:16.991 --> 27:19.508
Wow. That is pretty good.

27:19.610 --> 27:23.612
Now go grab Anna before she gets
hypnotized by that devil rock.

27:23.748 --> 27:25.314
Hey, can I talk to you?

27:25.416 --> 27:27.783
Sure, what's up?

27:27.852 --> 27:30.035
Everybody, um, I was just wondering

27:30.154 --> 27:32.254
if I could have your
attention for a minute?

27:32.490 --> 27:34.023
Jeremy, what are you doing?

27:34.158 --> 27:35.574
I, uh, I think you guys know...

27:35.660 --> 27:37.026
A little bit too much, probably...

27:37.128 --> 27:41.430
About, uh, this woman and my relationship.

27:41.532 --> 27:43.766
You know that I love you, always will,

27:43.868 --> 27:48.170
and you'll never find
anybody who loves you more.

27:48.306 --> 27:51.640
So, while we're in the
incredibly romantic place,

27:51.742 --> 27:55.694
I was just wondering if I could ask you...

27:55.813 --> 27:56.695
Jeremy...

27:56.814 --> 28:00.916
Wanted to ask here in front of everyone...

28:04.789 --> 28:05.304
Um... [Gasps]

28:05.423 --> 28:07.073
Oh. You all right?

28:10.461 --> 28:13.662
How stupid do you think I am?

28:18.903 --> 28:20.920
I know, Rach...

28:21.038 --> 28:23.472
about Adam.

28:23.941 --> 28:25.791
How many times are you gonna
make me look like a fool

28:25.910 --> 28:28.777
in front of these people, my family?

28:28.879 --> 28:32.214
I needed them to hear this
in case I ever lose it again

28:32.300 --> 28:34.566
and think you're anything less than poison.

28:35.653 --> 28:37.152
Put that away. You know
how I always used to say

28:37.254 --> 28:38.837
that the show's bad for you

28:38.923 --> 28:40.656
and how it brings out the ugliness in you?

28:40.758 --> 28:42.658
I was wrong, Rach.

28:42.793 --> 28:44.977
It's you that's ugly.

28:45.096 --> 28:47.279
And we're not just done.

28:47.365 --> 28:53.235
I'm gonna make sure you never
hurt anyone like this again.

28:53.337 --> 28:55.504
MAN: What? Britney, relax.

28:55.589 --> 28:57.873
Take that, bitch! All right, Britney, go.

28:57.942 --> 28:59.491
Everybody, back to work.

28:59.577 --> 29:01.944
We've still got a wedding to produce.

29:07.034 --> 29:09.585
[Yawns]

29:12.189 --> 29:14.039
Oh, God, don't do that!

29:14.158 --> 29:15.157
What? What?

29:15.259 --> 29:16.592
Look at me so early in the morning.

29:16.727 --> 29:18.677
- [Groans]
- Are you feeling any better?

29:18.696 --> 29:22.197
- Yeah, I'm fine.
- Okay, great. Well, get up.

29:22.299 --> 29:25.818
I've seen that look in
your eyes before, all right?

29:25.903 --> 29:29.088
I know you got double dumped
and you're on the edge,

29:29.173 --> 29:32.775
but today is not the day that
you get to lose your mind,

29:32.877 --> 29:34.109
you hear me? Sit down.

29:34.211 --> 29:38.614
Tomorrow, you can jump
off the Golden Gate Bridge,

29:38.699 --> 29:40.716
walk into traffic, whatever,

29:40.801 --> 29:42.818
but today, I need you on your toes.

29:43.037 --> 29:46.088
I need you to stick with the plan, okay?

29:46.173 --> 29:46.873
Think you can do that?

29:47.092 --> 29:48.624
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

29:48.844 --> 29:50.560
You know what you need to do?

29:50.646 --> 29:51.094
Yeah.

29:51.196 --> 29:54.131
Then go do it.

29:54.266 --> 29:56.049
[Bells ringing]

29:56.135 --> 29:58.618
[Chatter]

29:58.704 --> 30:00.670
Yeah, we got flowers going.

30:00.772 --> 30:02.772
Looks pretty good, huh?

30:02.908 --> 30:04.841
[Sighs] What do you think?

30:15.420 --> 30:17.721
What are we doing? I
just want to talk to you.

30:17.823 --> 30:19.456
[Door closes] I just need to know.

30:19.558 --> 30:21.324
Okay, something happened,
something changed,

30:21.410 --> 30:23.359
- and I really want to know what it is.
- What do you mean?

30:23.361 --> 30:25.361
You know I can handle it. I
want you to tell me the truth.

30:25.447 --> 30:26.880
Was the sex bad or was
it something that I said?

30:26.899 --> 30:29.266
