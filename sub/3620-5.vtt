THAT'S GONNA VANQUISH
A WHOLE LOT OF--

00:10.532 --> 00:11.359
NOTHING.

00:11.533 --> 00:13.100
WHAT?

00:13.274 --> 00:15.145
NOTHING. LOOK,
ALL WE NEED YOU TO DO
IS SURVEILLANCE,

00:15.319 --> 00:17.278
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE
IT'S YOUR FIRST
SOLO OUTING.

00:17.452 --> 00:19.280
OH, COME ON!

00:19.454 --> 00:21.630

00:21.804 --> 00:23.545
I'LL BRING
EXTRA POTIONS.

00:23.719 --> 00:26.765
NO. YOU ARE GOING TO GO,
YOU ARE GOING TO I.D.
THE DEMON,

00:26.939 --> 00:29.290
AND THEN YOU ARE GONNA
COME UP WITH A PLAN
AFTER THAT.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.248
YOU KNOW, I JUST HAVE
ONE QUESTION.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.685
ARE YOU GUYS REALLY
THIS OVERLY PROTECTIVE,

00:33.859 --> 00:35.252
OR ARE YOU JUST AFRAID
OF LETTING GO?

00:35.426 --> 00:36.949

00:37.124 --> 00:38.168
THERE'S GOT TO BE
A REASON YOU KEEP
HOLDING ME BACK.

00:38.342 --> 00:39.691
OR MAYBE YOU JUST
SECRETLY WANNA BE

00:39.865 --> 00:41.345
OUT THERE DOING IT
YOURSELF.

00:41.519 --> 00:43.043

ABOUT YOU GUYS.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.360
GREAT. JUST GREAT.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.448
DID HE FOLLOW YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL?

08:56.623 --> 08:57.928
WHAT HOSPITAL?

08:58.102 --> 08:59.756
YOU DIDN'T USE
YOUR POWERS, DID YOU?

08:59.930 --> 09:01.976
WELL, I HAD NO CHOICE.
THE IMPS WERE ATTACKING
AN INNOCENT.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.151
IMPS?

09:03.325 --> 09:04.892
ACCORDING TO THE BOOK,

09:05.066 --> 09:06.458
IMPS ARE THESE
GREMLIN-LIKE CREATURES,
BUT WAY NASTIER.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.199
I KNOW WHAT IMPS ARE.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.158
IF HE SAW HER USE MAGIC,
WE'RE SCREWED.

09:10.332 --> 09:13.030
WHY? HE CAN'T PROVE
YOU'RE ALIVE. YOU DON'T
EVEN LOOK LIKE YOU.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.250
WELL, HE MUST HAVE KNOWN
YOU WERE CONNECTED
TO US SOMEHOW.

09:15.424 --> 09:17.034
OTHERWISE, HE WOULDN'T
BE FOLLOWING YOU, RIGHT?

09:17.208 --> 09:18.296
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
SENT HER OUT.

09:18.470 --> 09:19.820

SUPPOSED TO

GO AND I.D.
THE DEMON.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.128
THAT'S ALL THAT I DID!
LOOK, IMPS HAVE AN IMP MASTER,

09:24.302 --> 09:26.087
SO IF WE ATTACK
THE IMP MASTER, WE CAN--

09:26.261 --> 09:28.089
NO, BILLIE.
THEY'RE GUNS FOR HIRE.

09:28.263 --> 09:30.047
THEY COULD BE WORKING
FOR ANY DEMON.

09:30.221 --> 09:32.006
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.137
WE GET THE IMP MASTER
SO HE CAN TELL US
EXACTLY WHERE THEY ARE.

09:33.311 --> 09:34.574
NO. WE'RE NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING.

09:34.748 --> 09:35.662
BUT I THINK--

09:35.836 --> 09:37.533
NO BUTS.
SHE'S RIGHT.

09:37.707 --> 09:39.448
IF THEY'RE WATCHING YOU,
THAT MEANS THEY'RE
WATCHING US,

09:39.622 --> 09:40.971
AND WE NEED TO BE
CAREFUL.

09:41.145 --> 09:42.320
SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

09:42.494 --> 09:44.322
WE JUST ACT NORMALLY
AND LIVE OUR LIVES

09:44.496 --> 09:46.411
AND HOPEFULLY
HE'LL GO AWAY,
SOONER OR LATER.

09:46.586 --> 09:49.023
WE'LL GO TO P-3 TOMORROW
JUST LIKE WE PLANNED--

09:49.197 --> 09:50.241
GREAT!

09:50.415 --> 09:52.722
AND YOU'LL GO TO NAPA
WITH DEX.

09:52.896 --> 09:54.594
WELL, I CAN'T GO NOW.

09:54.768 --> 09:56.073
WHY? HE'S GONNA BE HERE
IN A FEW MINUTES.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.989
WELL, LET'S JUST SAY
I'M NOT IN THE MOOD ANYMORE.

10:00.556 --> 10:03.037
THIS RUSE ISN'T REALLY
WORKING VERY WELL, IS IT?

10:03.211 --> 10:06.301
WELL, MAYBE WE NEED
TO GIVE IT A LITTLE
MORE TIME.

10:06.475 --> 10:07.955
YOU GUYS, I'M SO SORRY.

10:08.129 --> 10:10.740
IT'S OK, SWEETIE.
IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT.

10:12.655 --> 10:15.397
SO MUCH FOR
HAPPILY EVER AFTER.

10:17.486 --> 10:19.314
OH, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON!

10:19.488 --> 10:21.621
THERE'S GOT TO BE
SOME WAY TO FIX THIS.

10:21.795 --> 10:24.754
I COULD PUT MURPHY
TO SLEEP.

10:24.928 --> 10:26.364
NO, NO. THAT WON'T WORK.

10:28.845 --> 10:31.195
"TO MAKE A LOVER'S DREAM
COME TRUE."

10:31.369 --> 10:35.156
HMM. WELL, MAYBE AT LEAST
THIS ONE WILL HELP PHOEBE OUT.

10:35.330 --> 10:37.114

TURNS OUT OK.

NEED THE POWER OF THREE
