-Absolutely.
-Sam was about to go up there.

41:06.131 --> 41:09.034
She wondered if anybody wanted
to go with her.

41:17.643 --> 41:19.811
Any news?

41:19.845 --> 41:21.780
Vitals are stable, crits are
okay.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.916
-She hasn't woken up yet.
-How much longer is it gonna be?

41:24.950 --> 41:29.120
Oh, waking up takes awhile
after all that anesthesia.

41:29.154 --> 41:31.222
-Hey.
-Hey.

41:31.256 --> 41:32.891
Has anybody seen her?

41:32.924 --> 41:34.125
I saw her
on her way to Recovery.

41:34.159 --> 41:36.962
-She looked okay.
-Can we go in?

41:36.995 --> 41:41.232
Not yet. Dubenko said he'll let
us know.

41:41.266 --> 41:43.702
So I guess we wait.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.572
[PRATT SIGHS]

42:01.052 --> 42:05.757
I'm calling for pizza. Who's in?

42:05.791 --> 42:08.894
-Cool. Pratt, you buying?
-No, no, I'm not.

42:08.927 --> 42:11.797
-Sure, you are.
-You got cash, right?

42:11.830 --> 42:13.965
