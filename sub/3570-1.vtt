02:01.054 --> 02:02.254
- Fuck off.

02:35.288 --> 02:39.091
Oh, babe.

02:39.093 --> 02:39.853
Coffee.

02:43.997 --> 02:44.757
Molly?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.482
Molly, you see my ring?

03:12.825 --> 03:13.585
Molly?

03:20.400 --> 03:21.120
Shit.

03:55.868 --> 03:58.036
- Teddy, turn around and
get back in your truck.

03:58.038 --> 03:59.504
- Look, can I just talk to Molly?

03:59.506 --> 04:01.273
- Take one more step,
and I'm going inside

04:01.275 --> 04:02.641
and I'm getting my shotgun.

04:02.643 --> 04:05.244
- Angela, you're not
going to shoot me, OK?

04:05.246 --> 04:06.311
Let me just talk to Molly.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.746
Gordon, would help me out here?

04:12.352 --> 04:14.686
- Yeah, Teddy, I... I think
you should probably go.

04:17.923 --> 04:18.725
- Really?

04:21.226 --> 04:23.729
Well, look, I'm just
going to stand here.

04:23.731 --> 04:26.398
I'm just going to wait
until Molly comes out,

04:26.400 --> 04:27.899
and I hope she does!

04:27.901 --> 04:29.101
- Stay away from my daughter!

04:31.771 --> 04:32.491
- Hey.

04:39.112 --> 04:40.012
I'm sorry.

04:40.014 --> 04:40.912
I didn't know it was...

04:40.914 --> 04:41.546
Well, it was.

04:44.951 --> 04:45.651
- Molly.

04:45.653 --> 04:46.918
Trust me.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.519
I'm all right.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.655
- Molly, don't you
dare go with him.

05:03.569 --> 05:04.303
Oh, god.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.737
I'm so sorry.

05:05.739 --> 05:11.043
I don't... I can't
find my wedding ring.

05:11.045 --> 05:13.845
- I'm not coming back to you.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.887
I'm just going home.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.184
- OK.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.026
All right.

05:22.755 --> 05:23.595
All right.

05:41.074 --> 05:43.075
- Guess you should get going.

05:43.077 --> 05:45.844
- Guy does that to your only
sister, and that's your answer.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.884
I hope you're half as
ashamed of you as I am.

06:21.714 --> 06:22.434
- Hey.

06:37.497 --> 06:38.730
I'll clean this up.

06:45.104 --> 06:46.037
Mother fucker.

06:46.039 --> 06:47.205
You said it, man.

06:47.207 --> 06:48.673
- I was about to fuck him up.

06:48.675 --> 06:52.310
I was about to get up in
his face, and beat his ass.

06:52.312 --> 06:54.279
And I don't give a shit
if it's her husband.

06:54.281 --> 06:57.215
I'm about two seconds from going
to his fucking house right now.

06:57.217 --> 06:59.017
- You want to?

06:59.019 --> 07:00.152
- What?

07:00.154 --> 07:01.353
- I'm just throwing
this out there,

07:01.355 --> 07:02.487
but if you want to
do this for real,

07:02.489 --> 07:03.321
I might know a guy
who knows a guy.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.124
You know?

07:09.429 --> 07:10.395
- Shit, man.

07:10.397 --> 07:11.096
We gotta go back to work.

07:11.098 --> 07:11.797
- Already?

07:11.799 --> 07:13.198
Let's go.

08:23.135 --> 08:23.895
- Molly!

08:28.140 --> 08:29.941
- Hey.

08:29.943 --> 08:32.544
Sorry, I didn't think
you were working today.

08:32.546 --> 08:34.513
- Yeah, I just... I
switched shifts.

08:34.515 --> 08:37.916
Why, you... you didn't
want to see me?

08:37.918 --> 08:40.919
- I don't really
want to see anyone.

08:40.921 --> 08:43.522
- I think that you
should just come home.

08:43.524 --> 08:44.523
Molly, please.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.124
- I went home.

08:46.126 --> 08:48.693
- Yeah, I know, but what if he...

08:54.500 --> 08:55.600
- Here you go.

08:58.671 --> 09:00.791
Would it be all right
if I talked to Gordon?

09:14.253 --> 09:15.654
Look, I know what
you're thinking,

09:15.656 --> 09:18.823
and I... I got no
defense, all right?

09:18.825 --> 09:20.725
I did a horrible thing, man.

09:20.727 --> 09:24.095
But it's never going
to happen again.

09:24.097 --> 09:26.097
And I... I know it won't
make up for anything,

09:26.099 --> 09:28.166
but I think if you
want, you've got a right

09:28.168 --> 09:29.249
to take a swing at me.

09:37.476 --> 09:38.476
- No.

09:38.478 --> 09:40.679
That's... no.

09:44.450 --> 09:45.417
- OK.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.252
OK.

09:47.254 --> 09:52.190
Well, I think we should all
get a bite soon, or something.

09:52.192 --> 09:57.996
Or... I'm not going to hide
from this, or anything.

09:57.998 --> 09:58.758
- Sure.

10:26.592 --> 10:29.027
Son of a bitch.

10:29.029 --> 10:32.063
- Motherfucker comes in
here to my workplace?

10:32.065 --> 10:33.398
- Fucking Teddy.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.532
- He's here?

10:34.534 --> 10:35.500
- Yeah.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.135
He offered me a free shot.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.004
- What, at your sister?

10:39.006 --> 10:41.339
On him, you idiot.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.475
- So did you take it?

10:43.477 --> 10:44.109
- What?

10:44.111 --> 10:45.443
No.

10:45.445 --> 10:46.211
- Why not?

10:46.213 --> 10:47.278
What the fuck?

10:47.280 --> 10:50.181
- I can't do it...
we're in public.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.317
- So what do you want to do?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.252
- I want to fucking kill him.

10:57.089 --> 11:00.925
- Cause you know, as I
said, I might have a guy.

11:00.927 --> 11:02.394
- What do you mean, a guy?

11:02.396 --> 11:05.830
- Like... a guy.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.332
- Mark, you don't have shit, man.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.300
- Because I go fishing with
this guy who did some time.

11:09.302 --> 11:12.404
He had a cellmate he's
always talking about.

11:12.406 --> 11:14.539
He's done this kind
of thing before.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.574
- Dude, just because you
sell fucking dirt weed

11:16.576 --> 11:18.677
to high school kids
doesn't mean you're, you

11:18.679 --> 11:20.445
know, on the inside.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.447
- You want me to check
it out, or what?

11:25.351 --> 11:25.984
- Yeah.

11:25.986 --> 11:27.318
Whatever.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.688
I got work to do.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.855
- Like what?

11:42.101 --> 11:44.102
- How was work?

11:44.104 --> 11:46.671
- It was fine.

11:46.673 --> 11:48.673
- You gonna get paid
for that overtime?

11:51.011 --> 11:56.281
Every time I bring it up,
they just... I don't know.

11:56.283 --> 11:57.749
I'll see.

11:57.751 --> 11:59.084
- Not so much we'll see.

11:59.086 --> 11:59.951
It's just no.

11:59.953 --> 12:01.286
I wasn't done with it?

12:01.288 --> 12:02.053
- Right?

12:02.055 --> 12:04.823
- You know, when you let
people know that they can just

12:04.825 --> 12:06.591
take from you and you
don't do anything,

12:06.593 --> 12:08.026
that's exactly what they'll do.

12:26.246 --> 12:30.515
I got the number, man.

12:30.517 --> 12:31.483
- Oh.

12:31.485 --> 12:33.818
Um...

12:33.820 --> 12:34.986
- You backing out?

12:37.924 --> 12:41.893
No, I just... I don't
have that much money.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.895
- I thought you were
saving for a truck?

12:47.900 --> 12:49.734
- Yeah, I got like, two grand.

12:49.736 --> 12:51.636
- So you do got the money.

12:51.638 --> 12:53.271
I got the number if you want it.

12:57.443 --> 12:58.376
- Yeah.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.678
Yeah, I want it.

13:00.680 --> 13:01.880
- Come down to Henry's.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.666
- What's up?

13:21.668 --> 13:23.134
- I didn't get you nothing.

13:23.136 --> 13:24.135
- That's OK.

13:24.137 --> 13:24.857
- Hey.

13:27.506 --> 13:28.907
- You sure this isn't bullshit?

13:28.909 --> 13:29.874
- I called my man.

13:29.876 --> 13:31.876
He gave me the number.

13:31.878 --> 13:34.479
- And the money in my sock
drawer's gonna be enough?

13:34.481 --> 13:35.647
- You should ask him.

13:35.649 --> 13:36.848
I'm going to go get
another pitcher.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.216
You want one?

13:38.218 --> 13:39.417
Sure.

13:39.419 --> 13:40.418
- You got $5.00?

13:40.420 --> 13:42.020
- Are you fucking kidding me?

13:42.022 --> 13:44.989
- Mother fucker, I just did you a
favor, so I'm going to get 'em.

13:44.991 --> 13:46.157
So yeah.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.326
But just... I can't
spend anymore.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.328
Get the cheap shit.

14:41.881 --> 14:45.416
- Well, can't you just
have Doris take my shift?

14:45.418 --> 14:46.317
Well, I got the flu.

14:46.319 --> 14:47.440
You want me around food?

14:49.788 --> 14:50.955
I never take off.

14:54.026 --> 14:54.659
OK.

14:54.661 --> 14:55.894
Sorry.

14:55.896 --> 14:57.896
I'll call you when
I'm feeling better.

15:03.235 --> 15:06.237
Let me tell you
what we're gonna do.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.805
Tonight you can
crash on the couch.

15:07.807 --> 15:09.274
That's fine.

15:09.276 --> 15:11.776
Tomorrow you're going to
take your stuff and move out.

15:11.778 --> 15:12.644
- Molly.

15:12.646 --> 15:14.846
Molly, I'm... please.

15:14.848 --> 15:17.049
- Teddy, it's not even
close to being a question.

15:22.389 --> 15:23.388
All right.

15:26.659 --> 15:27.499
All right.

15:31.964 --> 15:39.771
What can I... Let me... let
me just take you to dinner.

15:39.773 --> 15:40.738
Just dinner.

15:40.740 --> 15:41.572
Please.

15:41.574 --> 15:42.674
Let me start over.

15:42.676 --> 15:44.842
Please, just dinner.

15:44.844 --> 15:48.980
And if... and if I do
anything that... that you

15:48.982 --> 15:56.421
don't want... anything
at all... I'm gone.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.223
I'm... I'll fucking
move out of town.

15:59.225 --> 16:03.728
I will, I... you'll never...
you'll never see me again.

16:03.730 --> 16:04.862
Please.

16:04.864 --> 16:06.497
Please, I'll do
whatever you want.

16:06.499 --> 16:07.231
I'm serious.

16:07.233 --> 16:09.567
I'm serious.

16:09.569 --> 16:10.201
Please.

16:10.203 --> 16:10.963
Please.

16:14.273 --> 16:16.074
- Fine.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.843
But this isn't some
kind of fresh start.

16:18.845 --> 16:21.212
You're not my husband
again until I say so.

16:24.049 --> 16:25.016
- That's fair.

16:25.018 --> 16:27.819
That's fair.

16:27.821 --> 16:29.781
- Yeah, it's fairer
than you deserve.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.017
Yeah?

16:59.019 --> 17:01.819
- Uh, is this Howard?

17:01.821 --> 17:04.055
Who's this?

17:04.057 --> 17:05.289
- My name's Gordon.

17:05.290 --> 17:08.126
Um, I'm calling about a job.

17:08.127 --> 17:09.993
What time is it?

17:09.996 --> 17:11.896
- Uh... I don't know.

17:11.897 --> 17:14.365
About 1:30?

17:14.367 --> 17:17.568
Yeah,
you're calling me this late?

17:17.569 --> 17:19.971
- Uh, I got a contract.

17:19.973 --> 17:20.972
What?

17:20.973 --> 17:23.141
- A con... a contract.

17:23.143 --> 17:25.710
Uh... to take care of someone?

17:28.213 --> 17:30.214
How much money you got?

17:32.684 --> 17:36.320
- Uh, $2,000.

17:36.322 --> 17:39.524
You want
to talk, you come to my place.

17:39.526 --> 17:41.059
I'm in Auburn.

17:41.061 --> 17:42.126
Auburn?

17:42.128 --> 17:44.362
- Pennsylvania.

17:44.364 --> 17:47.198
I live at
the end of East Rio Street.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.599
Jefferson County, Mississippi.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.371
- OK, well, I'll give you a call.

17:53.373 --> 17:54.839
No you won't.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.741
You come, or don't.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.043
End of East Rio Street.

17:59.045 --> 18:02.713
You pay expenses, too.

18:02.715 --> 18:03.714
- OK.

18:03.716 --> 18:05.116
Um... well...

18:24.103 --> 18:26.871
- So, I guess I'm
going to Mississippi.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.806
But just to talk to him.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.341
- He said he would do it?

18:30.343 --> 18:32.276
- Just to talk to him.

18:34.980 --> 18:36.247
You sure he's good?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.582
- I'm sure he's cheap.

19:17.289 --> 19:19.423
- You want to grab a drink first?

19:19.425 --> 19:21.959
- Dude, we just talked
about this on the phone.

19:21.961 --> 19:24.061
- I didn't know if you meant it.

19:24.063 --> 19:25.363
- Look, I don't
mean to be a dick,

19:25.365 --> 19:27.365
but can we please
just go to the motel?

21:02.461 --> 21:03.794
- Fuck!

21:03.796 --> 21:04.516
Fuck!

21:27.819 --> 21:30.054
- The store's sending
you to Mississippi?

21:30.056 --> 21:30.755
- Yes.

21:30.757 --> 21:32.690
It's just for the weekend.

21:32.692 --> 21:33.624
It'll be fine.

22:24.276 --> 22:25.943
- Hey, there.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.512
You ready to go?

22:28.514 --> 22:29.680
- Sure.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.282
- All right.

22:31.284 --> 22:33.617
Where do you want to go?

22:33.619 --> 22:35.586
- The Grill.

22:35.588 --> 22:37.988
- We could go some place nicer.

22:37.990 --> 22:39.156
- I like the Grill.

22:39.158 --> 22:40.591
- All right.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.094
We're just gonna see people
we know, and, you know,

22:43.096 --> 22:44.061
it's not private, and...

22:44.063 --> 22:47.631
- Is that a problem, Teddy?

22:47.633 --> 22:48.666
- No.

22:48.668 --> 22:56.207
I just thought, you know,
you might want to... The Grill

22:56.209 --> 22:56.969
it is.

23:01.947 --> 23:02.580
- Hey, Teddy.

23:02.582 --> 23:03.247
- Hey.

23:03.249 --> 23:03.981
Hey, Hank.

23:03.983 --> 23:04.782
How are ya?

23:04.784 --> 23:05.983
- I'm good.

23:05.985 --> 23:07.985
- How are you guys?

23:07.987 --> 23:08.986
Good seeing you.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.069
You know what you want?

23:25.071 --> 23:25.791
- Yep.

23:33.678 --> 23:35.246
- What can I get you guys?

23:35.248 --> 23:36.213
- Hi, Sally.

23:36.215 --> 23:37.348
- Hey, Teddy.

23:37.350 --> 23:37.982
- Molly.

23:37.984 --> 23:38.849
- Hey.

23:38.851 --> 23:39.817
How are the kids?

23:39.819 --> 23:41.185
- Oh, kids are great.

23:44.589 --> 23:45.923
Y'all know what you're getting?

23:45.925 --> 23:47.925
- Yeah, I'm going to have
the chicken fried steak,

23:47.927 --> 23:50.895
- I'll have the spaghetti,
with the, uh, meat sauce.

23:54.901 --> 23:58.202
- I'm going to stick
with water for now.

23:58.204 --> 23:58.964
- Water.

24:01.373 --> 24:03.407
- Yeah.

24:03.409 --> 24:04.742
- Can you get me a beer?

24:08.313 --> 24:09.146
- All right.

24:09.148 --> 24:10.114
I can handle that.

24:10.116 --> 24:10.948
I'll be right back.

24:10.950 --> 24:12.049
Thank you.

24:14.920 --> 24:16.754
- Why'd you get
the... the spaghetti?

24:16.756 --> 24:18.789
They don't even do
it like you like it.

24:18.791 --> 24:21.725
They don't have the
parm... the... the cheese.

24:21.727 --> 24:23.427
I mean, if you
want spaghetti, we

24:23.429 --> 24:24.995
can go to a place
that does that.

24:24.997 --> 24:26.096
- I want the spaghetti here.

24:26.098 --> 24:28.799
All right?

24:28.801 --> 24:29.366
- All right.

24:29.368 --> 24:31.335
Yeah.

24:31.337 --> 24:32.036
Yeah.

24:32.038 --> 24:32.758
Sure.

24:38.577 --> 24:40.911
You do anything fun today?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.047
- No.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.982
- Fair enough.

24:44.984 --> 24:45.824
- Whatever.

24:58.263 --> 25:01.065
- You're gonna be all
right to get home?

25:01.067 --> 25:01.765
- Yep.

25:01.767 --> 25:02.666
I'm good.

25:06.204 --> 25:08.706
- Well, maybe I could swing
by after work tomorrow?

25:08.708 --> 25:10.207
Maybe bring something
by the house,

25:10.209 --> 25:14.778
or... or we could go out
again, if... if... if you want.

25:14.780 --> 25:18.182
I got no problem with that.

25:18.184 --> 25:19.350
- I'll cook something up.

25:19.352 --> 25:20.551
- Is that all right?

25:20.553 --> 25:21.652
- What did I just say?

25:25.957 --> 25:27.917
- I guess I'll see
you tomorrow, then?

27:09.327 --> 27:11.295
What you want?

27:11.297 --> 27:14.732
- Uh, does Howard
Blake live here?

27:14.734 --> 27:17.468
Who's that?

27:17.470 --> 27:19.203
- My name is Gordon.

27:19.205 --> 27:22.806
Do you know where I
can find Howard Blake?

27:22.808 --> 27:23.841
Come on in.

27:33.652 --> 27:34.492
Come on in.

27:57.409 --> 27:58.976
What you want?

27:58.978 --> 28:03.280
- Uh... I... I just... we spoke the
other day on the phone about

28:03.282 --> 28:05.182
a potential job?

28:05.184 --> 28:06.250
- Why you come around here?

28:06.252 --> 28:07.518
I'm ain't got no work for you.

28:07.520 --> 28:10.487
- No, it was... it was
about me hiring you

28:10.489 --> 28:12.122
for a job in, uh, Pennsylvania?

28:14.826 --> 28:16.593
- Oh.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.995
You're the man with the money.

28:21.166 --> 28:23.901
- Yeah.

28:23.903 --> 28:28.439
So, how do we... how do
we go about doing this?

28:32.410 --> 28:35.512
- Take your shirt off.

28:35.514 --> 28:36.246
- What's that?

28:36.248 --> 28:36.980
- Your shirt.

28:36.982 --> 28:39.183
Take it off.

28:39.185 --> 28:41.185
I don't think you understand.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.986
- No, you don't understand.

28:47.625 --> 28:48.792
Take your god damn shirt off.

28:48.794 --> 28:49.893
- Whoa, no, no, no.

28:49.895 --> 28:51.762
- Take your shirt off!

28:51.764 --> 28:52.796
- Can you please
just put that down?

28:52.798 --> 28:53.397
- Take your god damn shirt off!

28:53.399 --> 28:54.119
- OK!

28:56.501 --> 28:58.402
Shirt's coming off.

28:58.404 --> 29:00.037
It's off.

29:00.039 --> 29:01.572
- Pants.

29:01.574 --> 29:02.206
- No.

29:02.208 --> 29:03.373
Please, sir.

29:03.375 --> 29:04.408
- Now!

29:04.410 --> 29:05.690
Get them god damn britches down!

29:11.082 --> 29:13.083
Shorts!

29:13.085 --> 29:14.752
- You don't need to think.

29:14.754 --> 29:15.794
Get your shorts down.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.130
Hands up.

29:26.132 --> 29:28.132
- I'm fixing to put you
down with this, here.

29:28.134 --> 29:29.099
OK.

29:29.101 --> 29:29.782
OK.

29:32.837 --> 29:34.004
- Turn around.

29:36.741 --> 29:38.175
- Look, I have the money.

29:38.177 --> 29:40.410
- And you'll still have
it when we're done.

29:53.525 --> 29:54.958
You look clean.

29:54.960 --> 29:56.527
Put your shorts up.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.334
- What the hell was that?

30:04.336 --> 30:07.504
- Well, now we both know
you ain't wearing a wire.

30:07.506 --> 30:09.706
Cops do that, you know?

30:09.708 --> 30:11.141
- Well, you could
have just said that,

30:11.143 --> 30:14.077
and made this whole
thing a lot easier.

30:14.079 --> 30:16.747
- Yeah, well it seemed
pretty from over here.

30:16.749 --> 30:18.448
Looked like you'd
done it before.

30:18.450 --> 30:19.249
- No.

30:19.251 --> 30:20.150
No.

30:20.152 --> 30:21.073
- Calm yourself.

30:25.423 --> 30:26.156
Sit down.

30:26.158 --> 30:27.038
Take a seat.

30:31.830 --> 30:36.066
So, what is it
you want me doing?

30:39.204 --> 30:43.207
- Um... well, I got
this brother in law.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.541
- Yep.

30:44.543 --> 30:46.410
- He's... he's a bad guy.

30:46.412 --> 30:47.611
I mean, really bad.

30:47.613 --> 30:50.380
He... he beat sup on my sister.

30:50.382 --> 30:51.715
- Yep.

30:51.717 --> 30:53.837
- I mean, the other day
he almost killed her.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.455
- So, what do you want me to do?

31:02.160 --> 31:05.562
- Well, I was wondering
if... you know,

31:05.564 --> 31:09.066
you... you could
take care of him?

31:11.703 --> 31:14.338
- Oh.

31:14.340 --> 31:16.139
You want me to kill him.

31:20.144 --> 31:22.546
- Yeah, well, I would like
to talk more about that.

31:26.918 --> 31:30.454
- How much money you
got on this, again?

31:30.456 --> 31:33.190
- Um... $2,000.

31:33.192 --> 31:34.032
Back home.

31:37.829 --> 31:40.264
- Well, let's go get it.

31:40.266 --> 31:43.700
I mean, maybe we can
discuss it a little more,

31:43.702 --> 31:45.802
if... if that's OK.

31:45.804 --> 31:46.837
- Sure.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.305
We can talk about it in the car.

31:48.307 --> 31:50.774
Girlfriend, and she says...

31:50.776 --> 31:52.809
she says, how did you know?

31:52.811 --> 31:54.912
All I did was drink
iced tea all night,

31:54.914 --> 31:56.747
and he didn't hit me once.

31:56.749 --> 31:59.149
And the girlfriend
says, she says...

31:59.151 --> 32:02.719
says that that's what happens
when you keep your mouth shut.

32:02.721 --> 32:03.481
Right?

32:08.059 --> 32:12.462
You ain't thinking that's funny
cause of your sister, I guess.

32:12.464 --> 32:15.699
Well, some people
got a sense of humor.

32:15.701 --> 32:17.167
- Sorry.

32:17.169 --> 32:21.905
Uh... so how long you been
doing this kind of thing?

32:21.907 --> 32:22.739
- What thing?

32:22.741 --> 32:25.375
The killing thing?

32:25.377 --> 32:27.911
- Well, a while.

32:27.913 --> 32:32.582
But it ain't exactly
full time, you know?

32:32.584 --> 32:35.585
It's hard telling how many
fellas want a man dead enough

32:35.587 --> 32:39.022
to pay for it, but not
enough to do it themselves.

32:39.024 --> 32:41.425
- And you've done this...
you've done this kind of thing

32:41.427 --> 32:42.292
before, right?

32:42.294 --> 32:44.261
For... for money?

32:44.263 --> 32:46.530
- Oh, sure.

32:46.532 --> 32:51.668
- So, how do we... how
do you go about it?

32:51.670 --> 32:56.139
- Well, you... you give me your
money, I shoot him in his head.

32:56.141 --> 32:58.141
Ain't like I'm teaching
Portuguese, or anything.

32:58.143 --> 33:01.812
- No, I just, mean, you
know, why do most people

33:01.814 --> 33:03.847
want to do something like this?

33:03.849 --> 33:05.415
- Jesus Christ.

33:05.417 --> 33:07.777
You keep nipping at my heels,
you're gonna buy me dinner.

33:11.323 --> 33:14.157
- Those motel walls
were so thin, all

33:14.159 --> 33:18.662
I was hearing for a week was...
And he's

33:18.664 --> 33:19.963
wanting to bust
his nuts, so he's

33:19.965 --> 33:22.833
like... you know how that is?

33:22.835 --> 33:24.468
Oh yeah, baby.

33:24.470 --> 33:25.736
For a week, man.

33:25.738 --> 33:28.872
I'm telling you,
it drove me crazy.

33:28.874 --> 33:31.141
These burgers are
fucking fantastic, man.

33:31.143 --> 33:32.676
I'm... I'm impressed.

33:35.513 --> 33:38.081
Mm.

33:38.083 --> 33:40.250
- So what do you like
to do in Mississippi?

33:40.252 --> 33:45.022
- Well, I keep myself
company just fine.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.225
- Are you from there?

33:48.227 --> 33:50.627
- Mm-mm.

33:50.629 --> 33:52.629
Mm.

33:52.631 --> 33:53.764
Born in Utah.

33:53.766 --> 33:54.664
Come out here about...

33:54.666 --> 33:56.700
- He's a terrible man.

33:56.702 --> 33:59.369
- You said that.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.339
- I wish I could
just do it myself.

34:02.341 --> 34:03.940
- Yeah.

34:03.942 --> 34:05.776
- I mean, that's moral, right?

34:05.778 --> 34:09.746
If it saves my sister, and... and
he goes off somewhere better?

34:09.748 --> 34:11.348
- Refill?

34:11.350 --> 34:13.216
- And the check, please.

34:13.217 --> 34:15.138
- I'll get that
right for you, hun.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.790
- How do you square
yourself off with God

34:19.792 --> 34:22.559
with something like this?

34:22.561 --> 34:24.527
- Seriously?

34:24.530 --> 34:28.197
- Son, if you hadn't figured
out that this stuff was

34:28.199 --> 34:32.235
bullshit by the time you reached
puberty, I got nothing for you.

34:32.237 --> 34:34.036
- What, you don't believe in God?

34:34.039 --> 34:35.605
Well, what the fuck
are you saying?

34:35.607 --> 34:38.675
We just die, and that's it?

34:38.677 --> 34:40.177
I couldn't live like that.

34:40.179 --> 34:42.012
- Well, that's great, but it
just exists in your head.

34:42.014 --> 34:44.947
Ain't none of my business.

34:44.949 --> 34:47.851
- I mean, I got my thoughts,
and you have yours, you know?

34:47.853 --> 34:49.186
Who knows, right?

34:49.188 --> 34:53.322
So I just... I just want
my sister to be happy.

34:53.324 --> 34:55.358
- Well, whether it's your
religion or your sister,

34:55.360 --> 34:57.461
you tell me what you
hold close, and I'll

34:57.463 --> 35:00.063
tell you where you're
lying to yourself.

35:00.065 --> 35:03.700
You be careful, boy.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.035
What are you looking at?

35:05.037 --> 35:05.735
- What?

35:05.737 --> 35:06.538
- Not you.

35:08.806 --> 35:11.274
You've been looking over here
for the past five minutes.

35:11.276 --> 35:12.609
You want to tell me why?

35:12.611 --> 35:15.045
- I don't like the way
you talk about religion.

35:15.047 --> 35:19.015
Maybe you want to shut up.

35:19.017 --> 35:22.419
- I don't give a good
god damn what you like.

35:22.421 --> 35:24.421
You better put those eyes
back in that soup boy,

35:24.423 --> 35:26.089
or you ain't gonna
have much use for 'em.

35:26.091 --> 35:28.011
- I'll look wherever
I want to look.

35:32.296 --> 35:33.697
- Yep.

35:33.699 --> 35:34.739
I guess you're gonna.

35:39.070 --> 35:42.973
- Look, maybe I made a
big mistake with this.

35:42.975 --> 35:44.274
- What?

35:44.276 --> 35:45.342
- Maybe I can just drive
you back home, and...

35:45.344 --> 35:46.476
- What, cause of that?

35:46.478 --> 35:48.145
- No, I'm just, you
know, thinking...

35:48.147 --> 35:50.388
- Why don't you go outside
and bring the car around?

35:53.284 --> 35:54.351
- We gotta wait for...

35:54.353 --> 35:55.986
- No, I'll take care of that.

35:55.988 --> 35:57.787
She'll bring it, we'll
square it up later.

35:57.789 --> 35:58.622
You go and get the car.

35:58.624 --> 36:02.626
- I'll meet you outside.

36:02.628 --> 36:04.027
- Oh.

36:04.029 --> 36:04.710
OK.

36:30.923 --> 36:33.823
- Get In the car.

36:33.825 --> 36:35.458
I didn't see you come out.

36:42.099 --> 36:43.466
- I got kids.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.336
- Oh, shit.

36:48.973 --> 36:49.906
- Hey.

36:49.908 --> 36:50.640
Hey.

36:50.642 --> 36:52.108
Look at me!

36:52.110 --> 36:53.243
Get in the car.

36:59.617 --> 37:01.017
No, no, no, no.

37:01.019 --> 37:01.618
No, no.

37:01.620 --> 37:03.019
Hey!

37:03.021 --> 37:04.020
Come here!

37:04.022 --> 37:05.488
You get in the car.

37:05.490 --> 37:07.023
You wanna talk about this,
we'll talk about it later.

37:07.025 --> 37:07.946
Get in the car!

37:38.389 --> 37:41.358
- Hey, you look... you look great.

37:41.360 --> 37:43.827
I got... I got you these.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.795
- Thanks.

37:45.797 --> 37:46.598
Come in.

38:26.604 --> 38:28.271
- Tastes good.

38:28.273 --> 38:31.508
- You've had it before.

38:31.510 --> 38:32.942
- Yeah, I know... I know.

38:32.944 --> 38:37.714
It's just... tastes like you
did something different.

38:37.716 --> 38:38.596
- Little bit.

38:42.420 --> 38:46.523
- Well, what'd you do?

38:46.525 --> 38:49.659
- It's just a new recipe.

38:49.661 --> 38:52.062
- Oh.

38:52.064 --> 38:58.234
Well, yeah, it's...
it's interesting.

38:58.236 --> 38:59.037
- Thanks.

39:05.443 --> 39:09.646
- Was it a recipe
with poison in it?

39:09.648 --> 39:12.349
I mean, it's like,
really, really bad.

39:12.351 --> 39:13.950
- It's not good.

39:13.952 --> 39:14.751
I'm sorry.

39:14.753 --> 39:15.652
- No, no.

39:15.654 --> 39:16.653
No, you tried.

39:16.655 --> 39:19.022
It's just... wow.

39:19.024 --> 39:20.757
Don't you work in a restaurant?

39:20.759 --> 39:23.093
Now you don't get to finish.

39:23.095 --> 39:23.827
- No.

39:23.829 --> 39:25.195
Wait, wait.

39:25.197 --> 39:25.929
I'm... I'm eating.

39:25.931 --> 39:26.529
I'm eating.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.098
Now I'm embarrassed.

39:28.100 --> 39:29.199
Never cooking again.

39:29.201 --> 39:31.234
- That might be smart.

39:31.236 --> 39:32.168
- OK.

39:32.170 --> 39:33.069
Now you're done.

39:33.071 --> 39:33.831
- Wait.

39:36.307 --> 39:38.541
- It's all right.

39:38.543 --> 39:40.243
I'm not going to hurt you.

39:40.245 --> 39:41.046
- I know.

39:46.484 --> 39:51.855
- I don't remember
the other night.

39:51.857 --> 39:53.156
You know that, right?

39:53.158 --> 39:54.891
I'm not saying that makes it OK.

39:54.893 --> 39:55.773
- It doesn't.

39:59.029 --> 40:00.964
- But it wasn't me.

40:00.966 --> 40:04.000
Do you know what I mean?

40:04.002 --> 40:04.934
- Yes it was.

40:08.239 --> 40:11.608
So don't forget that.

40:11.610 --> 40:13.943
Wait.

40:13.945 --> 40:14.866
I can do that.

40:18.315 --> 40:19.075
- Sure.

40:34.365 --> 40:36.166
- So you got any chores
that need doing?

40:36.168 --> 40:38.701
Can I swing by tomorrow?

40:38.703 --> 40:41.604
- I'll think of something.

40:41.606 --> 40:42.366
- Great.

40:45.242 --> 40:45.962
Hey.

40:46.812 --> 40:48.445
I'm sorry.

40:48.447 --> 40:49.212
I didn't mean to
make you nervous.

40:49.214 --> 40:49.979
- It's not that.

40:49.981 --> 40:52.982
It...

40:52.984 --> 40:53.983
- Well, what?

40:53.985 --> 40:54.751
What?

40:54.753 --> 40:55.952
- It just hurts.

41:05.696 --> 41:10.834
What are you... what
are you... what are you...

41:10.836 --> 41:13.636
what are you doing
with someone like me?

41:13.638 --> 41:15.038
Have you lost your mind?

41:15.040 --> 41:15.939
- What are you saying?

41:15.941 --> 41:20.210
I... if I saw that on anyone
else, I'd tell them to leave.

41:20.212 --> 41:21.778
- So what, you're
going to leave me?

41:21.780 --> 41:23.379
That's not... that's not what...

41:23.381 --> 41:24.414
- Yeah.

41:24.416 --> 41:25.582
Cause you signed on for this.

41:25.584 --> 41:26.649
You don't get to
make that decision.

41:26.651 --> 41:27.784
I already left you.

41:27.786 --> 41:29.519
- No.

41:29.521 --> 41:35.225
I... I love you so much,
and you did this to me.

41:35.227 --> 41:35.925
- I'm sorry.

41:35.927 --> 41:37.360
- No.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.829
You... you wanted to fix this.

41:39.831 --> 41:41.931
So you're going to go
home to wherever the hell

41:41.933 --> 41:44.400
you're staying, and
you're going to come back

41:44.402 --> 41:46.936
here tomorrow and
make it up to me.

41:46.938 --> 41:48.705
And you're going to
do that the next day,

41:48.707 --> 41:50.373
and every day after
that, and forever.

41:50.375 --> 41:51.056
OK?

41:53.911 --> 41:54.671
- Yeah.

42:00.150 --> 42:01.551
- Just go home.

42:01.553 --> 42:03.152
I'll see you tomorrow.

42:28.879 --> 42:32.081
Want to listen to the radio?

42:32.083 --> 42:33.483
- Naw.

42:33.485 --> 42:35.418
Think I'll just... I kind
of want to just get home.

42:35.420 --> 42:37.620
- Well, that's
where we are going.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.927
- Look, we never
really agreed to a...

42:43.929 --> 42:45.662
- I'm not leaving my
house in the middle

42:45.664 --> 42:46.896
of the night for nothing.

42:49.166 --> 42:52.835
- Well, I think I said I kind
of want to just talk about it.

42:52.837 --> 42:54.804
- We were talking
about how, not if.

42:54.806 --> 42:56.606
You'd best understand that.

43:01.345 --> 43:03.913
They don't know
what we're driving.

43:03.915 --> 43:05.748
And when they find
them bodies, they

43:05.750 --> 43:07.717
ain't gonna piece
anything together.

43:07.719 --> 43:12.855
They'll just be running around
like retards at the rodeo.

43:12.857 --> 43:16.559
Um, do you think that
maybe we could, you know,

43:16.561 --> 43:19.195
stay at a motel for the night?

43:19.197 --> 43:21.197
- I can drive till daybreak.

43:21.199 --> 43:23.319
- Yeah, well I kind of
want to crash in a bed.

43:26.303 --> 43:29.606
- Well, I guess every man
ain't cut out for the road.

43:40.250 --> 43:41.217
- All right.

43:41.219 --> 43:43.786
I'm gonna crash out.

43:43.788 --> 43:46.556
- Yeah, you had
yourself quite a night.

43:46.558 --> 43:48.858
Get yourself some sleep, there.

43:48.860 --> 43:49.580
- Yep.

43:52.363 --> 43:54.631
- Take a shower.

43:54.633 --> 43:56.673
Wash that shit off
the top of your lip.

43:59.036 --> 44:01.404
What time do you want to
hit the road in the morning?

44:04.575 --> 44:07.343
About 10:00.

44:07.345 --> 44:08.111
10:00 it is.

44:11.015 --> 44:12.348
- All right.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.230
See ya then.

44:19.024 --> 44:22.358
- I'm gonna need that phone.

44:22.360 --> 44:24.761
- Well, I don't
think you can just...

44:24.763 --> 44:27.230
- You gonna give it to me, or
you gonna make me come over

44:27.232 --> 44:27.997
and get it?

44:27.999 --> 44:28.879
Come on, now.

44:37.074 --> 44:38.007
Your cell, too.

44:40.477 --> 44:42.245
- It doesn't even
get reception here.

44:42.247 --> 44:43.146
- Well, lucky you.

44:43.148 --> 44:44.229
You won't even miss it.

45:02.733 --> 45:03.766
Get you some sleep.

45:10.474 --> 45:12.041
Try not to keep
yourself up thinking

45:12.043 --> 45:14.410
about all the people
done screwed on that bed.

45:58.622 --> 45:59.889
Enjoying the evening?

46:02.626 --> 46:05.561
- Can't sleep.

46:05.563 --> 46:09.232
- Wanna go curb
crawling, or something?

46:09.234 --> 46:10.233
I don't.

46:13.203 --> 46:14.403
- Then go back to sleep.

46:29.686 --> 46:30.453
10:00 AM.

46:30.455 --> 46:31.554
Time to get up.

46:36.026 --> 46:36.793
- What?

46:36.795 --> 46:37.927
It's 10:00.

46:37.929 --> 46:41.364
Time to hit the road.

46:41.366 --> 46:42.765
- OK.

46:42.767 --> 46:43.633
All right.

46:43.635 --> 46:46.302
- Gordon.

46:46.304 --> 46:48.337
- What?

46:48.339 --> 46:52.108
- I've spent my whole life
hand holding people like you.

46:52.110 --> 46:57.980
But you... you don't know
me at all, and that's fine.

46:57.982 --> 46:59.649
Hell, I might even
take comfort in that,

46:59.651 --> 47:04.453
but you best keep that in mind
before you do something stupid.

47:04.455 --> 47:07.690
Now, we're gonna
go to your house

47:07.692 --> 47:10.059
and do what you need done.

47:10.061 --> 47:12.929
Or you could just pay me the
money, and I'll be on my way.

47:12.931 --> 47:16.032
Either way, I don't care.

47:16.034 --> 47:19.635
But you're never going to
be a man in your own mind

47:19.637 --> 47:21.737
unless this thing is finished.

47:21.739 --> 47:24.974
And you ain't doing it yourself.

47:24.976 --> 47:28.744
Now, it sounds like
she ain't leaving him.

47:28.746 --> 47:31.914
And he sure ain't leaving her.

47:31.916 --> 47:34.951
So it's up to you.

47:34.953 --> 47:37.920
All you've got in
your life is choices.

47:37.922 --> 47:39.155
What's yours going to be?

47:45.662 --> 47:48.798
- I want him dead.

47:48.800 --> 47:51.567
- All right.

47:51.569 --> 47:52.435
Get yourself dressed.

47:52.437 --> 47:53.437
See you in the car.

47:56.240 --> 47:57.120
- Hey, Howard?

47:59.142 --> 48:02.311
Can you, uh, just do
me a favor, and not

48:02.313 --> 48:06.115
kill anyone else
until we get there?

48:06.117 --> 48:08.784
- Gordon, I don't think that's
a promise I could comfortably

48:08.786 --> 48:10.086
keep.

48:10.088 --> 48:13.756
Especially if you keep
running your mouth.

48:13.758 --> 48:15.458
See you outside in five.

48:40.817 --> 48:41.817
- Hey.

48:41.819 --> 48:42.539
- Hey.

48:54.431 --> 48:57.633
- That Auburn, you say?

48:57.635 --> 48:59.969
- Yep.

48:59.971 --> 49:03.005
- That's pretty much
Penntucky, isn't it?

49:03.007 --> 49:05.241
How cold it get up there?

49:05.243 --> 49:06.042
- I don't know.

49:06.044 --> 49:07.543
Pretty cold, I guess.

49:07.545 --> 49:10.413
- God damn, that's gonna do
my joins in something awful.

49:10.415 --> 49:13.582
- So what's... what's the plan for
keeping this whole thing quiet?

49:13.584 --> 49:15.584
- What's the worry, kid?

49:15.586 --> 49:16.986
- I don't know.

49:16.988 --> 49:18.854
What would happen if, you
know, you got arrested?

49:18.856 --> 49:21.757
- Why would I get arrested?

49:21.759 --> 49:22.892
- I don't know.

49:22.894 --> 49:23.659
You've been caught
before, right?

49:23.661 --> 49:24.994
- Jesus Christ.

49:24.996 --> 49:25.594
Do you want to see my
resume, or something?

49:25.596 --> 49:26.996
- No.

49:26.998 --> 49:28.197
I just know you went to
prison before, so I just...

49:28.199 --> 49:29.398
- Too chicken shit
to do it yourself.

49:29.400 --> 49:31.100
How about this?

49:31.102 --> 49:32.668
I want you money, so
I'm gonna warn you...

49:32.670 --> 49:37.139
you keep talking like this,
I'll shoot you in the mouth.

49:37.141 --> 49:38.975
I'm sorry.

49:38.977 --> 49:40.142
- If you knew how much
I felt like putting you

49:40.144 --> 49:42.064
down right now,
you'd keep it shut.

50:05.702 --> 50:06.769
- I'm gonna get a lemonade.

50:06.771 --> 50:08.904
You want one?

50:08.906 --> 50:10.406
- A lemonade?

50:10.408 --> 50:11.841
- Yeah.

50:11.843 --> 50:13.376
- No, Teddy.

50:13.378 --> 50:15.511
I know you've got the wife
thing and all, but I'm not 12.

50:15.513 --> 50:18.614
I don't want a lemonade.

50:18.616 --> 50:19.615
- All right.

50:19.617 --> 50:22.551
Well, I'm going to have one.

50:22.553 --> 50:26.122
- Well, hey, can you throw
my beers in the fridge?

50:26.124 --> 50:28.357
- You're really gonna make
me go inside with those?

50:28.359 --> 50:30.479
- You gonna want help
with the rest of this?

50:35.766 --> 50:36.732
- Fuck you, man.

50:43.573 --> 50:44.533
They're not mine.

51:15.806 --> 51:17.807
- Do... do you mind if I...

51:17.809 --> 51:19.175
- Mm-mm.

51:19.177 --> 51:21.777
- Well, I think
you've still got it.

51:21.779 --> 51:24.747
- Well.

51:24.749 --> 51:25.550
- Thanks.

51:27.751 --> 51:29.018
Hello?

51:29.020 --> 51:30.486
Where the hell are you?

51:30.488 --> 51:32.354
We have dinner with your
sister and the son of a bitch.

51:32.356 --> 51:33.656
You going to make it back?

51:33.658 --> 51:34.657
- Yeah.

51:34.659 --> 51:35.558
Yeah, I'll be home tomorrow.

51:35.560 --> 51:37.593
How's the job?

51:37.595 --> 51:39.528
- Uh, it's... it is good.

51:39.530 --> 51:40.463
You know?

51:40.465 --> 51:42.331
It... it is fine.

51:42.333 --> 51:44.500
Gordon,
I hate when you lie to me.

51:44.502 --> 51:47.002
It makes me think you did
something you know was stupid.

51:47.004 --> 51:48.571
- Mom, I'm not lying, OK?

51:48.573 --> 51:51.173
I just... I'm... I
can't talk right now.

51:51.175 --> 51:53.075
I'm... I'm driving.

51:53.077 --> 51:54.110
Fine.

51:54.112 --> 51:56.278
When we get home, we're gonna...

51:56.280 --> 51:58.781
- Lying to your mother?

51:58.783 --> 52:00.649
Sinner.

52:00.651 --> 52:04.753
- Look, I know you said the
whole the thing about the mouth

52:04.755 --> 52:07.189
and the shooting, but...

52:07.191 --> 52:08.324
- Doesn't sound like it.

52:08.326 --> 52:11.727
- Well, I'm... I'm
just kinda hungry.

52:17.602 --> 52:18.901
Wait.

52:18.903 --> 52:20.102
Where are we going?

52:20.104 --> 52:21.103
- If you wanna get
something to eat,

52:21.105 --> 52:22.638
we can get something to eat.

52:22.640 --> 52:24.140
- Well, how do you know there's
gonna be food around here?

52:24.142 --> 52:25.674
- Saw a sign.

52:25.676 --> 52:29.645
- Well, I didn't... I didn't
see any... I didn't see a sign.

52:29.647 --> 52:30.779
- Well, it was there.

52:30.781 --> 52:31.647
- Look, I'm sorry.

52:31.649 --> 52:34.150
I'll... can we just
please keep going?

52:34.152 --> 52:35.718
- No, we're gonna get
you something to eat.

52:35.720 --> 52:38.020
- I have the money waiting
at my house for you.

52:38.022 --> 52:39.622
- I know.

52:39.624 --> 52:41.023
- OK, so can we please just keep
going and get on the highway?

52:41.025 --> 52:42.558
I didn't... I didn't
see any signs.

52:42.560 --> 52:46.028
- Gordon, I don't need to
lie to you to kill you.

52:46.030 --> 52:48.731
We're gonna get you
something to eat.

52:48.733 --> 52:50.933
What?

52:50.935 --> 52:53.702
Are you afraid?

52:53.704 --> 52:56.805
You afraid?

52:56.807 --> 52:58.174
No worrying.

52:58.176 --> 53:00.075
I'm not gonna kill you.

53:00.077 --> 53:01.577
I'll just blow
your kneecaps off.

53:01.579 --> 53:02.745
How about that?

53:02.747 --> 53:03.512
- No.

53:03.514 --> 53:04.947
No, no.

53:04.949 --> 53:05.981
- You need those things, huh?

53:05.983 --> 53:07.223
Do you need those things, huh?

53:09.119 --> 53:10.286
Calm down.

53:12.956 --> 53:15.291
I'm not gonna shoot you.

53:15.293 --> 53:16.492
OK, I'm gonna shoot you.

53:16.494 --> 53:17.526
No!

53:17.528 --> 53:18.360
Fuck!

53:18.362 --> 53:19.028
- Hey.

53:19.030 --> 53:19.795
Just kidding.

53:19.797 --> 53:21.063
Just kidding.

53:21.065 --> 53:23.632
Relax, man.

53:23.634 --> 53:25.501
Why would I kill you?

53:25.503 --> 53:26.869
Why?

53:26.871 --> 53:30.806
You ain't paid me yet.

53:30.808 --> 53:31.807
Oh, fuck it.

53:31.809 --> 53:33.342
I'm just gonna do it.

53:33.344 --> 53:35.344
- Ow!

53:35.346 --> 53:36.912
- I'm just kidding.

53:36.914 --> 53:38.981
You relaxed now?

53:38.983 --> 53:40.316
You relaxed, mother fucker?

53:43.820 --> 53:44.486
Oh.

53:44.488 --> 53:46.422
Hey.

53:46.424 --> 53:48.224
Gonna get you something to eat.

54:17.220 --> 54:18.180
You ain't hungry?

54:20.924 --> 54:23.025
- I don't know.

54:23.027 --> 54:25.094
- You don't know?

54:25.096 --> 54:27.229
Go on, get something to eat.

54:27.231 --> 54:28.364
That's why we stopped.

54:28.366 --> 54:30.286
So you could get
something to eat.

54:31.901 --> 54:33.168
- Yeah.

54:33.170 --> 54:35.070
- Is there something
you want to tell me?

54:35.072 --> 54:36.939
- No, I'm... I'm fine.

54:39.576 --> 54:41.677
- You can't take a joke, can you?

54:44.180 --> 54:46.115
- I'm fine.

54:46.117 --> 54:47.650
- God damn.

54:47.652 --> 54:50.052
Am I just gonna
get that baby face

54:50.054 --> 54:54.123
for... I was messing with you.

54:54.125 --> 54:55.824
Don't turn into some bitch.

54:55.826 --> 54:56.525
- OK.

54:56.527 --> 54:59.328
I... I'm just freaking
out a little bit.

54:59.330 --> 55:01.563
I just wanted to talk about...

55:01.565 --> 55:02.331
- What?

55:02.333 --> 55:03.299
- The whole thing.

55:03.301 --> 55:05.868
The... I don't know.

55:09.773 --> 55:11.407
I don't know.

55:11.409 --> 55:14.076
- You want me to tell
you about my killing.

55:14.078 --> 55:15.611
Don't you?

55:15.613 --> 55:18.681
You been wanting me to tell
you about that since we met,

55:18.683 --> 55:22.251
- You don't... you don't
have to talk about it,

55:22.253 --> 55:25.220
if you don't want.

55:25.222 --> 55:26.922
- No, that's all right.

55:26.924 --> 55:27.690
It's OK.

55:27.692 --> 55:28.824
I... it's fine.

55:33.263 --> 55:34.663
OK, look.

55:34.665 --> 55:39.601
Uh... when I was a kid, I
had this golden retriever

55:39.603 --> 55:41.837
named Misty.

55:41.839 --> 55:44.173
I mean, that dog was dumb.

55:44.175 --> 55:47.776
He would bark at the
wind if it heard it.

55:47.778 --> 55:50.079
But she was nice enough.

55:50.081 --> 55:52.381
You know?

55:52.383 --> 55:53.182
It was the winter.

55:53.184 --> 55:55.517
I think I was 12.

55:55.519 --> 55:57.886
Someone left some food
outside, and a mountain lion

55:57.888 --> 55:58.921
came sniffing around.

55:58.923 --> 56:00.456
And bam, out goes Misty.

56:00.458 --> 56:02.791
And that mountain lion
pounced on that dog

56:02.793 --> 56:03.792
and snapped her neck.

56:03.794 --> 56:05.394
I mean, just like that.

56:05.396 --> 56:08.797
Out comes my old
man, .38 in hand.

56:08.799 --> 56:09.598
Fires the gun.

56:09.600 --> 56:12.234
Bullet hits the lion in the ass.

56:12.236 --> 56:15.504
It... it jumps up, honest to
god, about 8 feet in the air,

56:15.506 --> 56:17.573
does a double back flip,
lands on all fours,

56:17.575 --> 56:19.942
and it is gone into the
woods, just like that.

56:19.944 --> 56:21.777
I mean, pow!

56:21.779 --> 56:25.914
I mean... it... next morning,
I come out with my .22,

56:25.916 --> 56:28.984
and I'm gonna finish
it off, you know?

56:28.986 --> 56:32.388
I look around, not too
far... about a couple

56:32.390 --> 56:35.391
hundred yards beyond
the room for our house.

56:35.393 --> 56:37.659
Lion's there.

56:37.661 --> 56:39.161
Dead.

56:39.163 --> 56:44.133
And it's, uh, its cub is trying
to suckle at it, you know?

56:44.135 --> 56:46.668
Get the last bit of milk.

56:46.670 --> 56:50.739
I come up too close to it, and
it stops, and kind of looks

56:50.741 --> 56:53.976
up at me with these
desperate eyes.

56:53.978 --> 56:59.047
And I should've killed it
then, but because of my dog,

56:59.049 --> 57:02.718
I thought, well, hell,
I'll just let it suffer.

57:02.720 --> 57:03.600
It'd starve.

57:05.655 --> 57:08.490
But then I'm walking home,
and I'm thinking, well,

57:08.492 --> 57:11.794
Misty didn't suffer.

57:11.796 --> 57:14.163
She's here, and then she's
gone, and the mountain lion

57:14.165 --> 57:15.464
didn't suffer.

57:15.466 --> 57:17.599
A couple hours of
pain, and died.

57:17.601 --> 57:21.403
But me and the cub,
we suffered the most,

57:21.405 --> 57:23.365
because we had to
carry that with us.

57:25.942 --> 57:30.379
What I do isn't about
the people that die.

57:30.381 --> 57:33.715
It's about the people
that are left alive.

57:33.717 --> 57:38.687
They get the short end of the
stick, as far as I'm concerned.

57:38.689 --> 57:42.324
Some of them are
blindsided, and some of them

57:42.326 --> 57:43.926
think the ends
justify the means.

57:43.928 --> 57:49.198
But there ain't no ends,
as long as there's people.

57:49.200 --> 57:51.166
They go on.

57:51.168 --> 57:52.501
It just doesn't matter.

57:55.338 --> 57:57.206
- Yeah, well I think that...

57:57.208 --> 57:59.168
- I don't give a
shit what you think.

58:02.479 --> 58:05.247
And don't get on your
high horse with me.

58:05.249 --> 58:06.715
Because I didn't
show up at your house

58:06.717 --> 58:08.217
in the middle of
the night asking

58:08.219 --> 58:09.918
you to kill a man for money.

58:09.920 --> 58:13.789
So I'm sorry.

58:13.791 --> 58:15.757
I just... I'm...

58:21.064 --> 58:21.824
- What?

58:25.401 --> 58:28.270
- It's not like you still
mourn that dog, right?

58:32.041 --> 58:34.610
- What are you talking about?

58:34.612 --> 58:36.773
- Just that there ain't
much hope for the dead.

58:39.916 --> 58:41.250
- Where's your hope?

58:41.252 --> 58:43.385
- I have hope.

58:43.387 --> 58:44.853
I have hope for my sister.

58:44.855 --> 58:49.558
You know, and that... and
that she can be happy.

58:49.560 --> 58:51.193
She deserves to be happy.

58:53.796 --> 58:57.466
- Well, what's his name ain't
gonna get that chance, is he?

58:57.468 --> 58:58.467
- Teddy?

58:58.469 --> 59:00.068
- Yeah.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.069
- No, he ain't.

59:12.415 --> 59:13.715
- What you watching?

59:13.717 --> 59:14.518
- Sitcom.

59:17.186 --> 59:18.387
Knew he was going to say that.

59:18.389 --> 59:20.422
- Why'd you laugh, then?

59:20.424 --> 59:21.464
- Because it's funny.

59:28.031 --> 59:32.067
- So I guess you think
you're pretty funny, then.

59:32.069 --> 59:33.569
- Funnier than you.

59:33.571 --> 59:36.138
- Oh, yeah?

59:36.140 --> 59:36.900
- Yeah.

59:47.417 --> 59:49.351
Don't get my hair wet.

59:49.353 --> 59:50.113
- Sorry.

01:00:08.905 --> 01:00:10.405
Thought you were watching that?

01:00:10.407 --> 01:00:11.974
- No, it's stupid.

01:00:11.976 --> 01:00:13.775
They're supposed to be.

01:00:17.413 --> 01:00:18.313
Oh, hey... go back.

01:00:18.315 --> 01:00:19.114
I want to watch that.

01:00:19.116 --> 01:00:19.815
Hey, hey, hey.

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:21.216
- No.

01:00:21.218 --> 01:00:22.551
You can't.

01:00:24.554 --> 01:00:25.394
- All right.

01:01:06.262 --> 01:01:07.362
- OK.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:09.765
Good night.

01:01:09.767 --> 01:01:12.768
- You aren't coming in?

01:01:12.770 --> 01:01:15.637
- If that's all right?

01:01:15.639 --> 01:01:17.539
- Yeah, it's fine.

01:01:17.541 --> 01:01:18.507
Just don't push it, OK?

01:01:18.509 --> 01:01:20.609
We're going to sleep.

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:21.451
- All right.

01:01:33.589 --> 01:01:35.424
- Don't forget, we got
dinner tomorrow night

01:01:35.426 --> 01:01:37.325
with Gordon and my mom.

01:01:37.327 --> 01:01:38.087
- Yeah.

01:02:26.043 --> 01:02:27.175
We're here.

01:02:27.177 --> 01:02:29.544
- Yep.

01:02:29.546 --> 01:02:32.848
- I need a shower and a bed.

01:02:32.850 --> 01:02:34.449
- Well, you'll get it.

01:02:34.451 --> 01:02:36.384
After you go and get that cash.

01:02:36.386 --> 01:02:39.688
I'm gonna do it tonight.

01:02:39.690 --> 01:02:41.089
- What, that soon?

01:02:41.091 --> 01:02:42.424
- Why not?

01:02:42.426 --> 01:02:43.892
- I don't know.

01:02:43.894 --> 01:02:46.762
Don't... don't you have to,
like, scope out the area,

01:02:46.764 --> 01:02:47.629
or something?

01:02:47.631 --> 01:02:55.631
"-What for, Injuns?"

01:02:57.841 --> 01:03:05.447
"-What for, Injuns?"

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:06.681
You go get that money, now.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:07.249
- Yeah.

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:10.185
Um, do you think you want
to park here, though?

01:03:10.187 --> 01:03:12.287
Because my... my neighbors,
they might see something, or...

01:03:12.289 --> 01:03:14.322
- Well, you'd better hurry
up and go get it, then.

01:03:14.324 --> 01:03:15.084
Go on.

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:32.200
- Well, look who's back
from his big im... Hey.

01:03:34.411 --> 01:03:42.411
- Well, look who's back
from his big im... Hey.

01:03:46.290 --> 01:03:47.489
Who's your friend?

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:48.612
- Mind your own business.

01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.934
OK.

01:03:58.936 --> 01:04:01.236
- You can get your car
at the train station.

01:04:01.238 --> 01:04:03.205
How am I supposed to get it?

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:06.575
- I don't care.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:07.943
Did you forget something?

01:04:07.945 --> 01:04:08.844
- I gave it to you.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:10.145
I gave you the money.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:13.315
- Address?

01:04:13.317 --> 01:04:14.649
- Right.

01:04:14.651 --> 01:04:17.719
OK, and how do I,
uh, contact you?

01:04:17.721 --> 01:04:18.561
- You don't.

01:04:37.807 --> 01:04:39.847
- Did you get done
what you needed to do?

01:04:44.080 --> 01:04:44.800
- Yep.

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.884
- Well, why don't you
help me clean up?

01:05:09.373 --> 01:05:12.807
- I'm so comfortable.

01:05:12.809 --> 01:05:14.409
- All right, all
right, all right.

01:05:14.411 --> 01:05:18.546
Just don't... don't move, because
I think we've figured it out.

01:05:25.222 --> 01:05:27.088
My feet are poking out!

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:28.156
Sorry.

01:05:28.158 --> 01:05:29.457
- Sorry.

01:05:29.459 --> 01:05:30.219
Sorry.

01:05:35.698 --> 01:05:36.379
Mm.

01:05:56.652 --> 01:05:57.419
- Wait.

01:05:57.421 --> 01:05:59.020
I don't... no.

01:05:59.022 --> 01:06:00.388
- It's all right.

01:06:05.361 --> 01:06:08.296
- You can't make
a fool out of me.

01:06:08.298 --> 01:06:09.965
OK?

01:06:09.967 --> 01:06:12.701
Promise me.

01:06:12.703 --> 01:06:15.670
- I won't.

01:06:15.672 --> 01:06:16.671
I won't.

01:06:16.673 --> 01:06:17.513
I promise.

01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:34.556
- You ready?

01:06:37.526 --> 01:06:38.366
- Guess so.

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.640
- Smells good, Mom.

01:06:52.642 --> 01:06:54.109
- Hope it doesn't get him wasted.

01:06:57.113 --> 01:06:59.514
- Mom, do you think you
ever lie to yourself?

01:06:59.516 --> 01:07:05.754
About, like, things
that you care about?

01:07:05.756 --> 01:07:06.796
- What are you saying?

01:07:11.861 --> 01:07:14.996
- Nothing, just, you know, maybe
you tell yourself something

01:07:14.998 --> 01:07:17.899
because... I don't know...

01:07:24.106 --> 01:07:27.909
- Keep sharp objects away from
me when that man is close.

01:07:27.911 --> 01:07:29.210
And let me tell you something.

01:07:29.212 --> 01:07:31.846
I'm expecting you to
defend your sister.

01:07:31.848 --> 01:07:34.349
That is your job.

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:36.284
- I got it.

01:07:36.286 --> 01:07:39.154
- We're gonna talk about this
new attitude of yours later.

01:07:46.762 --> 01:07:47.662
Molly.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:48.663
It's good to see you.

01:07:48.665 --> 01:07:50.832
You're looking a bit better.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:51.833
Come in.

01:07:58.174 --> 01:07:59.941
You watch yourself.

01:07:59.943 --> 01:08:01.342
All right?

01:08:01.344 --> 01:08:02.343
- Yes, ma'am.

01:08:10.287 --> 01:08:14.155
What's this I hear about
business in Mississippi?

01:08:14.157 --> 01:08:16.591
You're in demand.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.560
Not really.

01:08:18.562 --> 01:08:19.602
- Well, I'm impressed.

01:08:38.814 --> 01:08:39.935
- Who wants to say grace?

01:08:50.759 --> 01:08:53.094
- I'd be happy to.

01:08:53.095 --> 01:08:55.055
- Well, why don't
you go ahead, then?

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:05.840
- Um, dear God, we
thank you for the food

01:09:05.841 --> 01:09:11.479
that Angela and Gordon
worked so hard to prepare.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:14.048
And may we learn to
appreciate the gifts

01:09:14.050 --> 01:09:16.518
the Lord has bestowed upon us.

01:09:23.626 --> 01:09:31.626
And may we earn the
forgiveness of those around us.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:40.975
When we... when we
make mistakes, may

01:09:40.977 --> 01:09:47.282
we learn to fulfill
our duties as men.

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:49.117
- You've got to be
fucking kidding me.

01:09:49.118 --> 01:09:50.350
- Mom!

01:09:50.353 --> 01:09:52.620
- I wasn't planning
on bringing this up.

01:09:52.622 --> 01:09:56.858
But you want a
conversation of it, I will.

01:09:56.860 --> 01:10:00.662
I wasn't kidding when I
told you I had a shotgun,

01:10:00.664 --> 01:10:03.131
and I'm not going to
use it to kill you...

01:10:03.133 --> 01:10:05.900
but if you touch that
girl one more time,

01:10:05.902 --> 01:10:08.136
I'm going to use it to
cut you off at the ankles.

01:10:08.138 --> 01:10:09.704
You got me?

01:10:09.706 --> 01:10:11.806
Leave you with two stumps.

01:10:11.808 --> 01:10:14.642
And when they get fucking
word of what you did,

01:10:14.644 --> 01:10:17.478
I'm not going to be
inside very long.

01:10:17.480 --> 01:10:21.649
You'll probably get a big
government check every month.

01:10:21.651 --> 01:10:23.384
But you better make
sure you can make it

01:10:23.386 --> 01:10:24.886
to the mailbox in a wheelchair.

01:10:29.258 --> 01:10:30.091
- I understand.

01:10:30.093 --> 01:10:31.659
- Oh.

01:10:31.661 --> 01:10:33.361
Well, thank you.

01:10:33.363 --> 01:10:36.364
How very humble of you.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:37.865
Why the hell are you even here?

01:10:41.070 --> 01:10:41.903
- I'm sorry.

01:10:41.905 --> 01:10:42.904
I just wanted...

01:10:42.906 --> 01:10:43.838
- You wanted.

01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:44.973
Oh.

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:46.174
There's something
that you wanted?

01:10:46.176 --> 01:10:49.143
Isn't that fucking fascinating?

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.346
You get this man out of my face.

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:53.715
I'm not here to redeem you, OK?

01:10:57.186 --> 01:10:58.653
Get him out of my face.

01:10:58.655 --> 01:11:00.388
Get him out of my face!

01:11:00.390 --> 01:11:01.756
- Hon, can you give us a minute?

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.191
- Maybe if I just...

01:11:03.193 --> 01:11:05.260
- Just go to the porch.

01:11:05.262 --> 01:11:06.828
I need to talk to my mother.

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:16.237
- If that's what you want.

01:11:16.239 --> 01:11:18.640
- Yeah, that's what we want.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:19.474
You feel bad?

01:11:19.476 --> 01:11:22.810
However bad you feel,
you should feel worse!

01:11:28.517 --> 01:11:31.986
You go have a smoke
outside with him.

01:11:31.988 --> 01:11:32.708
Yeah.

01:11:58.947 --> 01:12:00.548
- So tell me about Mississippi.

01:12:03.952 --> 01:12:05.553
- It's the same as here.

01:12:08.791 --> 01:12:13.661
- Gordon, do you think it's
better to do a bad thing

01:12:13.663 --> 01:12:15.263
and you know it's wrong, or...

01:12:15.265 --> 01:12:19.100
- Look, if I wanted to
bring it up, I would have.

01:12:19.102 --> 01:12:20.702
I'm not saying
that his is an act.

01:12:20.704 --> 01:12:26.441
I just... I don't really care
how you feel about anything.

01:12:32.815 --> 01:12:33.815
- Fair enough.

01:13:31.373 --> 01:13:33.775
- He really can't wait to
get off that hook, can he?

01:13:33.777 --> 01:13:35.743
- Mom.

01:13:35.745 --> 01:13:38.646
- Men always change
until you give them

01:13:38.648 --> 01:13:40.648
the chance to change back.

01:13:40.650 --> 01:13:42.083
- So, what?

01:13:42.085 --> 01:13:44.719
I'm supposed to move back here?

01:13:44.721 --> 01:13:47.488
Start over?

01:13:47.490 --> 01:13:49.424
I have a life that
I like, and there's

01:13:49.426 --> 01:13:52.827
more to it than a couple
nights that went wrong.

01:13:52.829 --> 01:14:00.829
- You stay, you may never realize
how good life could have been.

01:14:01.237 --> 01:14:04.138
- Who's got it better?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:06.274
You?

01:14:06.276 --> 01:14:08.342
Gordon?

01:14:08.344 --> 01:14:10.278
I don't know what this
better life looks like,

01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:11.446
but I don't see it here.

01:14:11.448 --> 01:14:12.980
- You sound like
someone who's trying

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:17.351
to seem real reasonable about
doing something god awful.

01:14:17.353 --> 01:14:19.387
Just like your husband
on that one, huh?

01:14:19.389 --> 01:14:21.556
- I love that you just
assume I'm stupid.

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:25.393
- It's not about
intelligence, babe.

01:14:25.395 --> 01:14:28.029
It's... it's a
matter of judgment.

01:14:28.031 --> 01:14:31.666
And you're in love with
him, so you don't have any.

01:14:31.668 --> 01:14:34.802
Won't you please just
listen to me for once?

01:14:34.804 --> 01:14:37.738
Ever since you turned 16, you
just stopped listening to me.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.909
It makes sense, I guess.

01:14:41.911 --> 01:14:43.444
16 year old kid.

01:14:43.446 --> 01:14:46.047
Older than her mom
was when she was born.

01:14:46.049 --> 01:14:48.816
I can't... I can't blame you
for thinking that that made me

01:14:48.818 --> 01:14:52.086
And you've been smart,
up to this point.

01:14:52.088 --> 01:14:56.324
But you cannot have kids
with a man like that.

01:14:56.326 --> 01:14:57.892
They are all the same.

01:14:57.894 --> 01:15:00.995
And I can't approve
of this, not one bit.

01:15:00.997 --> 01:15:02.430
Not on my watch.

01:15:02.432 --> 01:15:04.265
- It's not your life.

01:15:04.267 --> 01:15:05.199
It's not Gordon's.

01:15:05.201 --> 01:15:06.133
It's not even Teddy's.

01:15:06.135 --> 01:15:08.369
It's mine.

01:15:08.371 --> 01:15:10.037
- Fine.

01:15:10.039 --> 01:15:11.439
Fine.

01:15:11.441 --> 01:15:13.908
Next time I get a bloody
pulp on my front doorstep,

01:15:13.910 --> 01:15:15.910
I don't know if I'm
gonna let it in.

01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:21.249
- You don't have
to worry about it.

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:24.018
Cause I don't want
anything from you.

01:15:24.020 --> 01:15:27.421
- Good Cause you're
not getting anything!

01:15:27.423 --> 01:15:28.155
- Let's go.

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:28.856
We're leaving.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:29.991
- What?

01:15:29.993 --> 01:15:30.858
- Oh, yeah.

01:15:30.860 --> 01:15:32.026
And fuck you.

01:15:32.028 --> 01:15:33.160
- Fuck me?

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:34.795
Oh, you're not coming back.

01:15:34.797 --> 01:15:35.530
Not ever.

01:15:35.532 --> 01:15:36.264
- Like I would.

01:15:36.266 --> 01:15:37.131
- Mom.

01:15:37.133 --> 01:15:38.266
- You stay out of it.

01:15:38.268 --> 01:15:39.300
- I'm done.

01:15:39.302 --> 01:15:40.735
I'm done with this house, OK?

01:15:40.737 --> 01:15:43.437
I hope you have a
lot of cover up.

01:15:43.439 --> 01:15:44.199
- Bitch.

01:16:04.826 --> 01:16:07.995
- Leave me alone, will ya?

01:16:07.997 --> 01:16:09.263
Just go back inside.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:27.915
Pull over.

01:16:27.917 --> 01:16:31.285
- Stop the car!

01:16:31.287 --> 01:16:31.919
Ugh!

01:16:31.921 --> 01:16:34.255
I can't stand that woman!

01:16:34.257 --> 01:16:35.222
- Yeah.

01:16:35.224 --> 01:16:35.944
Yeah.

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:40.227
Hey.

01:16:40.229 --> 01:16:41.229
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:16:41.230 --> 01:16:42.597
You all right?

01:16:42.599 --> 01:16:43.798
Does that hurt?

01:17:27.476 --> 01:17:29.343
- Sweetheart?

01:17:29.345 --> 01:17:31.312
- Yeah?

01:17:31.314 --> 01:17:33.914
- I need something.

01:17:33.916 --> 01:17:35.683
- What?

01:17:35.685 --> 01:17:39.487
- I don't know how to tell you.

01:17:39.489 --> 01:17:40.521
- What?

01:17:40.523 --> 01:17:41.763
Anything you want, you got it.

01:17:44.159 --> 01:17:45.126
- I'm thirsty.

01:17:45.128 --> 01:17:46.527
- Oh, come on.

01:17:46.529 --> 01:17:49.030
Oh, come... no.

01:17:49.032 --> 01:17:50.331
- No, please.

01:17:54.870 --> 01:17:56.237
OK.

01:17:56.239 --> 01:17:56.920
OK.

01:18:00.208 --> 01:18:01.175
Fuck.

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:03.310
I fed the dog.

01:18:03.312 --> 01:18:05.312
All right.

01:18:05.314 --> 01:18:07.314
Fine.

01:18:07.316 --> 01:18:09.150
Mm.

01:18:09.152 --> 01:18:12.186
Where are my pants?

01:18:12.188 --> 01:18:13.421
- They're on the floor.

01:18:13.423 --> 01:18:14.143
- OK.

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.193
OK.

01:18:19.195 --> 01:18:22.096
All right, here we go.

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:24.632
But you owe me so
big for this, OK?

01:18:24.634 --> 01:18:25.514
You hear me?

01:19:20.088 --> 01:19:20.808
Here.

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:50.885
- Are you just gonna
stand around all night,

01:19:50.887 --> 01:19:54.421
or do you wanna
come back to bed?

01:19:54.423 --> 01:19:55.055
- Yeah.

01:19:55.057 --> 01:19:57.324
Sure.

01:19:57.326 --> 01:19:58.359
Give me one sec.

01:20:05.500 --> 01:20:08.769
I'm thinking of having a beer.

01:20:08.771 --> 01:20:09.670
Just one.

01:20:09.672 --> 01:20:11.238
Is that cool?

01:20:11.240 --> 01:20:12.306
- Yeah, if you want.

01:20:15.310 --> 01:20:16.377
- Just one.

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:17.378
You know?

01:20:17.380 --> 01:20:18.345
It's not like...

01:20:18.347 --> 01:20:20.047
- If you want to, you should.

01:20:24.719 --> 01:20:25.920
- All right.

01:20:33.562 --> 01:20:36.530
It's all good.

01:20:36.532 --> 01:20:38.299
- I know.

01:20:43.271 --> 01:20:44.031
- Jesus.

01:20:48.677 --> 01:20:49.677
Hey.

01:20:49.679 --> 01:20:51.512
This better be...

01:20:58.653 --> 01:21:00.187
- You mother fucker!

01:21:00.189 --> 01:21:01.155
Fuck you!

01:21:01.157 --> 01:21:02.122
Son of a bitch!

01:21:07.796 --> 01:21:08.429
- Hey!

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:11.198
Hey!

01:21:11.200 --> 01:21:13.601
You wanna die?

01:21:13.603 --> 01:21:14.535
Wanna die?

01:21:14.537 --> 01:21:15.536
Huh?

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.137
You wanna die?

01:21:17.139 --> 01:21:17.938
Huh?

01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:19.139
You wanna die?

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.461
- I shouldn't have yelled.

01:23:24.466 --> 01:23:26.300
- What?

01:23:26.302 --> 01:23:27.103
- Nothing.

01:23:30.839 --> 01:23:31.605
- Mom...

01:23:31.607 --> 01:23:33.040
- I said nothing.

01:24:55.190 --> 01:24:56.356
- I didn't think you'd come.

01:24:56.358 --> 01:24:57.891
- What do you got
under that blanket?

01:24:57.893 --> 01:24:58.792
- Nothing.

01:24:58.794 --> 01:25:00.627
I got nothing.

01:25:00.629 --> 01:25:01.595
Nothing.

01:25:01.597 --> 01:25:02.398
Nothing.

01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:06.300
Hey.

01:25:06.302 --> 01:25:08.068
Hey!

01:25:08.070 --> 01:25:09.703
You want to do this?

01:25:09.705 --> 01:25:10.337
Come on, man.

01:25:10.339 --> 01:25:12.406
You really want to do this?

01:25:15.343 --> 01:25:17.344
The hard part
ain't the doin' it.

01:25:17.346 --> 01:25:21.882
The hard part is livin' with it.

01:25:21.884 --> 01:25:24.151
- I'm already living with it.

01:25:27.522 --> 01:25:29.189
- You do this, it's
gonna change you.

01:25:29.191 --> 01:25:31.024
You won't know who you are.

01:25:31.026 --> 01:25:33.427
- I'll know that I'm alive.

01:25:33.429 --> 01:25:36.697
Might not mean much to you, but
it'll be more than you have.

01:25:45.940 --> 01:25:49.243
- I got a brother in Colorado.

01:25:49.245 --> 01:25:54.214
I want you... I'm
gonna give you...

01:25:54.216 --> 01:25:55.782
I'll give you his phone number.

01:25:58.486 --> 01:26:01.889
