00:06.407 --> 00:09.543
REPORTER 2: Conrad,
how do you make up
for five years in prison?

00:09.577 --> 00:13.147
How do you make up
for five years in prison?

00:13.181 --> 00:14.648
REPORTER 3: Would you
like to say anything?

00:15.716 --> 00:18.519
What I have is empathy,
for Emily Byrne.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.522
She suffered
worse than I have.

00:23.057 --> 00:28.496
Emily, you and I
have both been victimized
by the same person.

00:28.529 --> 00:31.665
He must be caught
before he hurts
anyone else.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.545
Detective Gibbs,
please.

00:48.716 --> 00:49.750
Detective Gibbs?

00:52.019 --> 00:53.053
Yeah.

00:53.087 --> 00:54.455
Kelly Price.

00:54.488 --> 00:56.457
The desk sergeant said
you're the one to speak to.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.058
About?

00:58.092 --> 00:59.560
That woman on the news...

00:59.993 --> 01:01.329
The FBI agent.

01:01.995 --> 01:03.764
The one who was kidnapped.

01:03.797 --> 01:05.133
What about her?

01:05.733 --> 01:07.268
She wasn't kidnapped.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.223
And you know this how?

01:29.257 --> 01:31.225
Because I saw her
two weeks ago.

01:34.895 --> 01:36.764
Where did you
see Emily Byrne?

01:36.797 --> 01:38.432
Late at night.
The tenth.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.168
On the marina.

01:40.201 --> 01:41.969
I go jogging there.

01:42.002 --> 01:43.504
She was arguing with a man.

01:45.373 --> 01:46.940
Did you hear
anything specific?

01:46.974 --> 01:50.378
They were trying to
keep their voices down,
but they were arguing.

01:51.945 --> 01:53.381
Can you describe the man?

01:54.548 --> 01:57.651
Tall, over six feet,

01:57.685 --> 01:59.119
long hair, it looked dyed,

01:59.153 --> 02:00.321
he was well dressed.

02:00.354 --> 02:02.556
Let me stop you there
for a minute.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.893
I wanna show you
a couple of pictures.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.495
You can stop me
when you want.

02:13.066 --> 02:14.268
That's him.

02:18.972 --> 02:20.641
You saw Emily Byrne

02:20.674 --> 02:22.676
arguing with this man
two weeks ago?

02:23.744 --> 02:25.279
Yes, detective.

02:45.966 --> 02:47.167
JACK: You okay?

02:49.237 --> 02:51.472
Just remember the brake
is the left pedal.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.780
Look, we don't have to
do this right now,
if you don't want to.

02:59.813 --> 03:01.282
No, I need to do this.

03:02.483 --> 03:04.585
I want to be able to
take Flynn places.

03:05.786 --> 03:06.787
Okay.

03:07.788 --> 03:08.856
Let's go.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.123
Okay.

03:10.157 --> 03:11.392
Bless us all.

03:16.196 --> 03:17.231
Be careful!

03:18.399 --> 03:20.701
It's okay.
It's okay.

03:20.734 --> 03:21.735
It's okay.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.237
Sorry.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.607
All right. Nice and slow.

03:31.211 --> 03:32.413
Watch this guy!

03:41.822 --> 03:42.823
It's all right.

03:44.124 --> 03:45.326
JACK: It's all right.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.729
Okay, just...

03:48.762 --> 03:50.398
Drive slowly, pull off.

03:51.164 --> 03:52.500
Em, you okay?

03:53.467 --> 03:55.135
Yeah.
It's okay. Breathe.

03:58.339 --> 04:00.240
Em, it's okay. Em.

04:02.109 --> 04:03.311
Look at me.

04:04.144 --> 04:05.279
Just look at me, Em.
Jack!

04:05.313 --> 04:06.714
Take a deep breath.
I can't breathe.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.749
It's okay, just talk to me,
tell me what's going on.

04:08.782 --> 04:09.917
Jack, I can't breathe.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.218
Just breathe. It's okay.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.120
You're safe. It's fine.

04:13.153 --> 04:14.722
No, it's fine.
Look at me.

04:16.490 --> 04:18.426
You're fine. It's okay.

04:18.459 --> 04:20.060
Get me out of here.

04:20.093 --> 04:21.529
It's okay. Emily!

04:25.098 --> 04:26.166
Emily!

04:26.199 --> 04:27.635
Emily, what's wrong?

04:59.500 --> 05:00.634
Hey.

05:00.668 --> 05:01.835
Hey.

05:16.984 --> 05:18.852
Sorry. I'm sorry.

05:21.655 --> 05:22.656
I...

05:25.125 --> 05:26.860
I can't be around you.

05:26.894 --> 05:27.995
Or her,

05:28.028 --> 05:31.365
without feeling like
I'm betraying someone.

05:39.607 --> 05:41.442
Then why are you here now?

05:44.211 --> 05:45.679
I can't do this alone.

06:01.495 --> 06:02.696
It's okay.

06:07.100 --> 06:10.170
MAN: We combed Harlow's
correspondence, nothing there.

06:10.203 --> 06:13.040
No prints on the card
Emily received
with those flowers,

06:13.073 --> 06:16.109
but the water in
the vase, it's the same
water in the tank.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.646
MAN: We struck out on
regional tank manufacturers.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.047
We're going broader.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.651
And the cabin is owned by
a maze of shell corporations.

06:23.684 --> 06:27.354
It ends at an Arthur Crespi
who died in 197...

06:27.387 --> 06:29.322
Look, somebody's
gotta say this.

06:29.356 --> 06:31.425
Could Emily have
killed Semerov?

06:31.925 --> 06:33.193
No.

06:33.226 --> 06:34.995
I'm inclined to
agree with Nick.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.964
NICK: It's a frame job
and you know it.

06:36.997 --> 06:39.366
If we confront her,
her reaction
could tell us a lot.

06:39.399 --> 06:40.701
ADAM: Okay, people.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.571
Whoever killed Robert Semerov
is still on the loose.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.105
He could strike again.

06:45.138 --> 06:48.275
As to who held Emily,
we work that case, too.

06:48.308 --> 06:50.110
And if the two converge,
so be it.

06:52.212 --> 06:55.483
EMILY: I got this
blank space where
my memories should be.

06:56.083 --> 06:57.084
This

06:58.151 --> 07:00.053
rage that I can't control.

07:05.325 --> 07:07.127
I lost it on the docks.

07:09.697 --> 07:11.899
And I can't stop
thinking about Harlow.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.604
Harlow's being retried
for your abduction.

07:16.637 --> 07:19.039
Yeah, well,
tried isn't convicted.

07:23.276 --> 07:25.112
How are things with Nick?

07:26.514 --> 07:28.148
There's nothing with Nick.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.584
He chose her.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.052
He never "chose," Emily.

07:32.486 --> 07:33.687
You were dead.

07:35.222 --> 07:36.924
Yeah, well,
he could choose now...

07:38.726 --> 07:40.961
So is that what you want?

07:40.994 --> 07:42.095
Now that you're back?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.831
Your old life?

07:46.299 --> 07:47.501
I don't know.

07:50.437 --> 07:52.573
I don't know if
I'd know how to live it.

08:12.425 --> 08:13.761
Sorry.

08:13.794 --> 08:14.795
Yeah.

08:17.130 --> 08:18.131
Yes.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.168
Okay.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.537
It's Nick.

08:29.442 --> 08:30.744
Hey.

08:30.778 --> 08:33.647
Hey, you're gonna have to
come to the office.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.849
Nick, I'm supposed to
see Flynn today.

08:37.084 --> 08:40.020
I know. But unfortunately,
it can't wait.

08:40.053 --> 08:42.556
I'll tell Alice
that you're helping
with the case.

08:43.390 --> 08:46.293
Boston PD is
working with us now.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.995
They have some
questions for you.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.066
Okay... Should I be worried?

08:54.401 --> 08:55.603
I got you a lawyer.

09:00.540 --> 09:01.909
What?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.243
What are you talking about?

09:03.276 --> 09:05.613
What's going on?
What can't you tell me?

09:06.246 --> 09:07.581
You just said it.

09:08.348 --> 09:09.817
I can't.

09:09.850 --> 09:11.184
We'll get through this.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.821
I gotta go.

09:13.854 --> 09:14.855
Emily.

09:30.237 --> 09:33.941
I know how disappointed
you must be about Semerov.

09:34.875 --> 09:35.876
Look...

09:37.277 --> 09:39.079
What I did,
I'm sorry.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.214
It's not me.

09:41.248 --> 09:42.282
TOMMY: It is you...

09:43.316 --> 09:44.317
Emily.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.022
That's part of the problem
we're having.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.224
You stabbed someone
when you first returned
and then...

09:51.258 --> 09:53.326
You heard what the doctor
said about that.

09:53.360 --> 09:55.963
ADAM: You should have
seen the look in
your eyes at the docks.

09:56.864 --> 09:58.598
You'd have killed that man.

10:00.567 --> 10:03.303
What are we doing
in here when Semerov
is still out there?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.305
He's not.

10:05.338 --> 10:08.942
Robert Semerov has been
in our custody since
the day you came back.

10:11.411 --> 10:12.746
He's been in our morgue.

10:13.647 --> 10:15.015
He was a John Doe.

10:16.316 --> 10:17.918
A floater in the Charles.

10:18.986 --> 10:22.790
And whoever killed him
cut off his eyelids.

10:22.823 --> 10:25.993
Semerov was dead
for two weeks
when we found him,

10:26.026 --> 10:28.061
so he couldn't have
been your captor.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.765
That's part one
of our problem.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.267
What's part two?

10:34.301 --> 10:37.104
Emily, your DNA was found
on Semerov's body.

10:38.706 --> 10:40.240
Did you kill Semerov?

10:51.318 --> 10:52.820
TOMMY: Was it in self

10:55.122 --> 10:57.390
There's no need to lie
if that's what happened.

10:57.424 --> 10:58.992
EMILY: No, I never saw him.

11:00.460 --> 11:02.730
I mean, I don't
even remember...

11:02.763 --> 11:04.097
TOMMY: Ask your lawyer.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.067
In case you've forgotten,

11:07.100 --> 11:09.369
"I don't remember"
doesn't float in court.

11:09.402 --> 11:11.638
Come on,
what's your theory?

11:11.671 --> 11:13.573
She what?
Kidnapped herself?

11:13.606 --> 11:14.908
Maybe.

11:14.942 --> 11:16.777
Maybe she was Harlow's
accomplice all along.

11:16.810 --> 11:19.346
You think I put
myself in the tank.

11:19.379 --> 11:20.781
Is that what you think?

11:20.814 --> 11:22.716
The tank had a timer.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.121
Tell her.

11:30.357 --> 11:32.059
Tell me what?

11:32.092 --> 11:35.562
There's a witness
who puts you with
Semerov weeks ago.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.997
Arguing.
No.

11:37.731 --> 11:39.399
No, that is not true!

11:39.432 --> 11:40.801
How can you say that

11:40.834 --> 11:42.135
if you can't remember
where you were
two weeks ago?

11:42.169 --> 11:43.536
Just make this stop,
I can't...

11:43.570 --> 11:44.772
Or two years ago?
Or six?

11:44.805 --> 11:46.473
Hey, come on.

11:46.506 --> 11:48.776
Your witness really
wants their 15 minutes,
don't they?

11:48.809 --> 11:50.477
Yeah, maybe they're
a part of the plan.

11:50.510 --> 11:51.845
Whose plan?

11:52.279 --> 11:53.280
This man's?

12:03.757 --> 12:06.927
Whoever had me
is Harlow's partner.

12:08.028 --> 12:10.330
And that's who's
behind all of this.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.901
You like being a pawn?

12:19.372 --> 12:20.373
And you?

12:23.710 --> 12:25.278
You know me, Adam.

12:26.146 --> 12:28.548
LAWYER: Are you arresting
my client?

12:28.581 --> 12:30.183
'Cause for now
we're done here.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.787
No.

12:35.055 --> 12:36.756
But when I do, it'll stick.

12:48.535 --> 12:49.536
NICK: Emily.

12:50.403 --> 12:51.404
Emily.

12:53.773 --> 12:54.975
Em, please.

12:57.410 --> 12:58.946
Why did you let that happen?

12:58.979 --> 13:00.480
You were an agent.

13:00.513 --> 13:02.349
You know what has to happen
with evidence like...

13:02.382 --> 13:03.383
Evidence?

13:10.958 --> 13:12.625
Who the hell
is this witness?

13:12.659 --> 13:14.161
I've got this
under control.

13:14.962 --> 13:16.396
I need you to trust me.

13:21.301 --> 13:22.903
Can I see my son now?

13:23.803 --> 13:25.105
Of course.

13:26.606 --> 13:27.707
Let me drive you.
No.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.843
Just work the case.

13:45.125 --> 13:46.593
There's someone at the door.

13:48.628 --> 13:49.829
Yeah.

13:50.363 --> 13:51.464
Yeah, I think so.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.336
Sorry, I'm late, Alice.

13:58.271 --> 14:00.007
No worries. Come in.

14:01.241 --> 14:02.242
Thank you.

14:06.746 --> 14:08.748
Nick said you were
helping with the case.

14:08.781 --> 14:09.883
I am.

14:09.917 --> 14:11.118
Any leads?

14:12.385 --> 14:13.386
Yeah.

14:15.155 --> 14:16.589
He's up in his room.

14:18.625 --> 14:19.893
I'll make some coffee.

14:20.593 --> 14:21.594
Thanks.

14:30.737 --> 14:31.939
Hey.

14:32.339 --> 14:33.340
Hi.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.012
I got you something.

14:40.413 --> 14:41.414
Thanks.

14:57.630 --> 14:59.199
This is cool. Thanks.

15:10.843 --> 15:12.279
So, you still like yogurt, huh?

15:12.312 --> 15:13.313
Yeah.

15:17.684 --> 15:20.720
I remember the first time
that I gave you yogurt.

15:20.753 --> 15:23.790
I smushed some
bananas in it because

15:23.823 --> 15:26.559
you needed a familiar taste.

15:26.593 --> 15:28.195
And that was it,
you were hooked
after that.

15:28.228 --> 15:31.331
You used to call out for
"nangurt, nangurt."

15:31.364 --> 15:33.400
That's what you
called banana yogurt.

15:34.601 --> 15:36.269
I like Oreo yogurt now.

15:36.669 --> 15:37.937
Oh.

15:38.738 --> 15:39.973
Well, I will...

15:41.041 --> 15:43.710
I'll have to bring
some Oreo yogurt
the next time.

15:44.577 --> 15:45.578
Cool.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.620
Wow!

15:55.055 --> 15:56.256
Look at these!

15:56.823 --> 15:58.025
That's amazing.

15:59.559 --> 16:00.994
Are these all yours?

16:01.028 --> 16:03.496
I won that at regionals.
I got first place.

16:03.530 --> 16:05.132
No way. That's...

16:06.033 --> 16:07.600
That's so amazing.

16:08.668 --> 16:10.337
Did your dad
take any videos?

16:11.238 --> 16:12.239
Yeah.

16:13.740 --> 16:15.275
Can I finish my game?

16:15.942 --> 16:17.144
Okay.

16:17.844 --> 16:19.112
Uh...

16:19.879 --> 16:21.414
I'll just...

16:55.048 --> 16:56.649
Are you okay?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.156
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:11.198 --> 17:12.699
MAN: Great credit.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.601
No speeding tickets. CPA.

17:14.834 --> 17:16.236
Yeah,

17:16.269 --> 17:17.970
but does she seem
too perfect?

17:18.004 --> 17:19.272
Mmm.

17:19.306 --> 17:21.774
No links to Harlow though.
Or Emily.

17:23.876 --> 17:25.178
She's on the move.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.384
Hold on.

17:47.334 --> 17:49.336
Let's check some prints.
All right.

17:52.505 --> 17:54.341
ALICE: Of course,
this is hard for me.

17:56.309 --> 17:57.310
Go on.

17:59.246 --> 18:00.980
Maura, what can I do?

18:01.013 --> 18:02.815
It should be about
what's best for Flynn,

18:02.849 --> 18:04.517
but she wants to see her son.

18:06.753 --> 18:07.654
Of course, I worry.

18:07.687 --> 18:10.089
Nick says the doctors
cleared her, so...

18:13.793 --> 18:15.195
I'll call you back, Maura.

18:16.163 --> 18:18.097
Sorry, I thought
I'd help clean up.

18:18.131 --> 18:19.432
Thank you.

18:25.938 --> 18:27.474
I should get going.

18:35.848 --> 18:37.217
Look at that.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.219
Kelly Price is
Regina Talbot.

18:39.252 --> 18:41.421
NICK: Early arrests for drugs,

18:41.454 --> 18:44.391
looks like she made
a big career move
to money laundering,

18:44.424 --> 18:47.160
her last arrest was for
laundering six million
for the Russian mob.

18:47.194 --> 18:50.029
So much for the credibility
of BPD's witness.

18:50.062 --> 18:52.599
Let's bring up
her known associates.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.667
She laundered money
for a dead guy.

18:54.701 --> 18:57.237
Another locked up
the last ten years.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.639
What about this one?

19:00.240 --> 19:01.641
Jonathan Cooper.

19:01.674 --> 19:03.610
His last arrest was
for false imprisonment
and battery.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.678
There's no connection
to Harlow though.

19:05.712 --> 19:06.713
Yeah?

19:07.347 --> 19:08.715
Guess where Cooper works.

19:10.183 --> 19:11.718
He's a goddamn florist.

19:13.653 --> 19:14.654
Let's go.

19:21.628 --> 19:22.662
Hey.

19:27.434 --> 19:28.435
Come in.

19:35.141 --> 19:36.343
What do you think?

19:38.077 --> 19:39.512
It's nice.

19:43.516 --> 19:46.653
I got tired of living in
that big house all alone.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.788
I see you brought
your old chess board.

19:52.024 --> 19:53.226
Check.

19:56.663 --> 19:58.798
Oh! Before I forget,

19:58.831 --> 20:01.301
I've been hanging on to
something for you.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.416
So, Harlow walks.

20:16.883 --> 20:17.884
Unbelievable.

20:19.051 --> 20:20.253
We'll get him.

20:20.487 --> 20:21.488
Yes.

20:22.021 --> 20:23.222
We will.

20:34.033 --> 20:35.402
I missed you.

20:39.806 --> 20:42.509
I'll be right there, okay?
Jesus! Fuck!

20:45.978 --> 20:47.179
Jonathan Cooper.
What?

20:47.213 --> 20:48.648
FBI.
Fuck!

20:48.681 --> 20:50.683
Get back here!
Get back here!

20:51.851 --> 20:53.853
Get it in. Get it in.

20:53.886 --> 20:55.288
NICK: Stop, Cooper!

20:55.655 --> 20:56.656
Stop!

20:57.624 --> 20:59.726
We just wanna talk, Cooper!

20:59.759 --> 21:00.793
Get out of the way!

21:02.929 --> 21:04.631
Get out of the way! Move!

21:05.732 --> 21:06.866
Stop!

21:09.068 --> 21:10.303
Cooper!

21:11.070 --> 21:12.405
Come out!

21:12.439 --> 21:14.941
We just wanna ask you some
questions, Jonathan...

21:17.744 --> 21:18.878
Go around. Go on.

21:41.468 --> 21:43.603
Cover the front, I'm going up.
Okay.

22:03.155 --> 22:04.190
Don't move!

22:09.261 --> 22:10.563
Did you have her
in that cabin?

22:10.597 --> 22:12.432
Where
No! No, no, no!

22:14.867 --> 22:17.737
I'm gonna throw you
out of this window,
so help me God.

22:18.170 --> 22:20.707
Nick! Nick!

22:20.740 --> 22:21.974
Cover the exit!

22:22.008 --> 22:23.242
Cover the exit!

22:23.275 --> 22:25.812
JONATHAN: I don't know
what the hell
you're talking about.

22:25.845 --> 22:27.780
No, no... No! No! No!

22:27.814 --> 22:30.149
Regina Talbot.
What do you know
about her?

22:30.182 --> 22:31.751
She just cleans
my money, man!

22:32.985 --> 22:34.353
What else?
No! No!

22:34.754 --> 22:35.755
Okay, okay...

22:35.788 --> 22:38.090
She's laundering money
for the Russians.

22:38.124 --> 22:40.627
Semerov?
Yeah. Sure.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.362
She's working for
one of your guys, too, man.

22:44.631 --> 22:45.465
What?

22:45.498 --> 22:47.233
A Fed. A crooked Fed.

22:47.266 --> 22:48.835
Out of the Boston office.

22:50.136 --> 22:51.137
MAN: Nick!

22:54.441 --> 22:56.509
Who's the Fed?
I don't know, I swear.

22:57.076 --> 22:58.411
I don't know.

23:03.816 --> 23:06.486
NEWSREADER:
After being released
from prison earlier today,

23:06.519 --> 23:10.690
Conrad Harlow paused
on the courthouse steps
to make this statement,

23:10.723 --> 23:14.761
speaking directly
to the FBI,
and to Emily Byrne herself.

23:14.794 --> 23:17.630
HARLOW: What I have
is empathy for Emily Byrne.

23:18.531 --> 23:20.500
She's suffered worse
than I have.

23:22.068 --> 23:27.540
Emily, you and I
have both been victimized
by the same person.

23:27.574 --> 23:30.543
He must be caught
before he hurts anyone else.

23:30.577 --> 23:32.679
NEWSREADER:
Heir to the Harlow
banking fortune,

23:32.712 --> 23:36.483
Conrad Harlow was
the prime suspect in
a series of murders

23:36.516 --> 23:38.718
where the victims were all
young women.

23:38.751 --> 23:42.221
In a legal twist,
the recent reappearance
of Emily Byrne,

23:42.254 --> 23:44.090
vacates the murder verdict.

23:44.123 --> 23:47.627
It is expected that Harlow
will be retried for kidnapping,

23:47.660 --> 23:50.530
but there is no word
on when that might happen.

24:52.525 --> 24:56.529
Are you going to come out
of the shadows or are you
just here to watch me?

25:25.457 --> 25:27.594
I was expecting you
at some point.

25:28.828 --> 25:31.230
You missed a camera
on your way in.

25:34.300 --> 25:35.935
Are you here to kill me?

25:40.439 --> 25:42.174
I want to know
how you did it.

25:46.445 --> 25:48.615
You could never prove
I killed anyone.

25:51.117 --> 25:52.151
It was you.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.555
You were there.

26:33.559 --> 26:35.061
How did you do it?

26:37.096 --> 26:38.364
Who helped you?

26:40.499 --> 26:42.368
The answers are
in your head, Emily.

26:43.569 --> 26:45.304
If you could
only remember...

26:47.239 --> 26:48.374
I want a name.

26:52.745 --> 26:55.614
If you could
see that look
in your eyes...

26:57.750 --> 26:59.118
We both have it.

27:01.520 --> 27:03.022
You're sick.

27:35.287 --> 27:36.288
Yeah.

27:38.357 --> 27:40.026
Come on in,
it's unlocked.

28:08.821 --> 28:10.156
MAN: Boston PD.

28:34.413 --> 28:36.816
TOMMY: I gotta say,
this stunt you just pulled,

28:38.184 --> 28:39.385
not the smartest move.

28:39.418 --> 28:40.452
Yeah, well, I had to.

28:40.486 --> 28:43.222
Nobody else is interested
in finding out who had me.

28:44.891 --> 28:47.059
What would you have done
if we didn't show up?

28:47.860 --> 28:49.762
I wasn't there to hurt him.

28:51.898 --> 28:53.665
I just thought
that if I could
get a look at him,

28:53.699 --> 28:55.567
maybe I'd remember.

28:55.601 --> 28:57.703
You still think
he had a partner?

28:57.736 --> 29:00.106
He called Nick and
he knew where I was,

29:00.139 --> 29:01.407
so, I think
he had a partner.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.876
And I think
that partner killed
Semerov, too.

29:06.645 --> 29:08.180
I've been reading up on you.

29:09.148 --> 29:10.349
Asking around.

29:10.382 --> 29:13.452
So, then you'll know
I didn't kill anybody.

29:13.485 --> 29:16.022
I think you might
challenge me
for the title.

29:16.055 --> 29:16.956
Of?

29:16.989 --> 29:18.825
Most stubborn cop in Boston.

29:22.028 --> 29:25.998
Personally, I prefer,
"relentless" or "best."

29:32.905 --> 29:34.874
But what kind
of cop are you?

29:34.907 --> 29:38.444
Are you the kind that
closes cases or one who
actually solves them?

29:42.148 --> 29:43.149
I like it.

29:44.383 --> 29:45.384
Can I use it?

29:45.852 --> 29:47.486
Go right ahead.

29:47.519 --> 29:50.056
It's what my dad told me
when I said I wanted
to be just like him.

29:50.089 --> 29:51.891
Well, we have that
in common.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.893
My dad was a cop.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.265
Harlow called before.

30:00.432 --> 30:03.202
He's not pressing charges.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.476
And your ride's here.

30:17.383 --> 30:19.986
I'm the second type of cop,
by the way.

30:22.288 --> 30:23.289
I hope you are.

30:27.860 --> 30:29.761
Wait here one sec.

30:29.795 --> 30:30.997
You need to talk
to your witness.

30:31.030 --> 30:32.164
Relax, she didn't ask
for her lawyer.

30:32.198 --> 30:33.699
Yeah, I would talk
to her, Gibbs.

30:33.732 --> 30:35.101
Look, I know this is
close to home...

30:35.134 --> 30:37.069
I'm just sparing you
the embarrassment.

30:37.103 --> 30:39.438
Ask her about Regina Talbot.
You can thank me later.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.506
Stay out of my business.

30:40.539 --> 30:41.540
Do your job!

30:55.854 --> 30:57.489
What the hell
were you thinking?

30:57.523 --> 30:59.658
I had to do something,
it was my only move.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.993
You're not
an agent anymore!

31:01.027 --> 31:03.162
And with what you've been
through, you can't...

31:03.195 --> 31:05.097
You can't trust yourself
in a situation like that.

31:05.131 --> 31:07.233
I don't need
a lecture, Nick.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.942
Do you have any idea
what this is like?

31:20.412 --> 31:22.348
I lost everything, Nick.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.884
You know me. Is this me?

31:36.062 --> 31:38.965
BPD's witness isn't
who she says she is.

31:42.368 --> 31:44.003
Who is she?

31:44.036 --> 31:46.305
Her real name is
Regina Talbot.

31:46.338 --> 31:49.341
She's got a sheet,
drugs and money laundering.

31:52.044 --> 31:53.980
Are there any ties
to Harlow?

31:54.546 --> 31:56.015
No.

31:56.048 --> 31:58.150
But she laundered money
for Semerov.

32:02.354 --> 32:04.290
Em, she became

32:04.323 --> 32:07.026
Kelly Price with the help
of one of us.

32:07.793 --> 32:09.628
An FBI agent.

32:09.661 --> 32:13.332
From the Boston
field office, someone she
laundered money for.

32:16.368 --> 32:17.336
What is it?

32:17.369 --> 32:19.605
I think I know
where this is
coming from.

32:19.638 --> 32:23.509
When I was working
Semerov's case, he was always
one step ahead of me.

32:24.910 --> 32:29.581
Every raid, every move
I made, he was always
there just before.

32:29.615 --> 32:31.950
Were you looking at
anyone in particular?

32:31.984 --> 32:33.952
I just started digging.

32:36.455 --> 32:39.291
Whoever did this, when they
thought that Harlow killed me,

32:39.325 --> 32:41.460
they though their problems
were solved.

32:42.128 --> 32:43.862
But then I came back.

32:43.895 --> 32:47.299
Listen, first, I think we
should go after the crooked
agent in the office.

32:49.235 --> 32:51.603
I'm taking you
back to Jack's.

32:52.904 --> 32:54.906
And that's where
you're gonna stay.

32:54.940 --> 32:56.142
No more stunts.

32:56.675 --> 32:57.843
Agreed?

32:57.876 --> 32:59.078
Yeah.

33:20.632 --> 33:22.234
OPERATOR: We're sorry,
you have reached a number

33:22.268 --> 33:25.104
that has been disconnected
or is no longer in service.

33:35.614 --> 33:36.882
I'll call you tomorrow.

33:36.915 --> 33:38.417
Let you know
where we're at.

33:44.456 --> 33:45.457
What?

33:49.261 --> 33:52.231
We'd still be together
if none of this
ever happened.

33:56.001 --> 33:57.503
You ever think about that?

34:04.976 --> 34:06.178
I do.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.416
Thank you.

36:30.021 --> 36:31.223
Come on.

37:32.451 --> 37:33.652
Hey.

37:33.685 --> 37:34.920
Where were you?

37:34.953 --> 37:36.955
Well...

37:36.988 --> 37:40.258
I picked up Emily
and I dropped
her off at Jack's.

37:41.760 --> 37:43.261
I stopped for a drink.

37:47.466 --> 37:49.000
I think somebody
was outside.

37:49.901 --> 37:51.269
Riggs was growling.

37:51.937 --> 37:52.938
Alice...

37:56.107 --> 37:57.576
It was probably...

37:57.609 --> 37:59.345
Probably the neighbor's dog.

38:01.680 --> 38:03.582
We didn't get to
talk last night.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.685
Emily came by yesterday.

38:08.019 --> 38:09.020
How was she?

38:10.489 --> 38:12.391
She makes Flynn
uncomfortable.

38:12.424 --> 38:14.259
That'll pass.

38:14.292 --> 38:17.262
They just need to
work it out together.

38:17.295 --> 38:18.964
She makes me uncomfortable.

38:20.999 --> 38:23.168
She needs compassion
from us.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.302
After what she's
been through.

38:24.336 --> 38:26.004
I know, Nick.
I'm trying.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.475
You've been away
so much lately.

38:29.508 --> 38:31.543
I just need to see
this case through.

38:33.111 --> 38:34.413
Once it's over...

38:34.446 --> 38:37.215
Well, things can
get back to normal.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.450
Don't lie to me.

38:40.318 --> 38:41.953
There is no more normal.

38:47.393 --> 38:48.860
I'll take him to bed.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.538
Arms up, arms up.

39:23.995 --> 39:25.397
MAN:  Tommy,
we're at the apartment.

39:25.431 --> 39:27.599
No Kelly Price here.
Her car's gone, too.

39:29.835 --> 39:32.438
Put an APB on her
and the car.

39:43.014 --> 39:46.485
OPERATOR:
All available units,
stabbing victim, possible DOA

39:46.518 --> 39:48.454
at 721 South Brookline.

39:50.321 --> 39:52.991
Did you say
721 South Brookline?

39:53.792 --> 39:55.226
Roger that.

39:55.260 --> 39:57.395
Three William 56, I'm on it.

40:10.476 --> 40:13.445
RECORDED VOICE:
You've reached Nick Durand,
please leave a message.

40:19.751 --> 40:20.752
Damn it.
