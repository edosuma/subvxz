He's got another nine
coming in next week.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.325
The deal in Boyacá?

00:24.425 --> 00:25.859
Gift that keeps on giving.

00:25.959 --> 00:27.661
Boring.

00:27.761 --> 00:29.997
He wants to make sure you can
handle that much volume. Vince.

00:30.098 --> 00:32.600
All earmarked
for the Carin Casino. Vince.

00:32.700 --> 00:34.935
You promised
no business.

00:35.035 --> 00:36.437
I did say
no business.

00:36.537 --> 00:38.806
Then we can dance?

00:38.906 --> 00:40.007
Not quite yet.

Annapolis? Our son?

01:21.749 --> 01:24.685
I mean, I just...
I don't-I don't accept it.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.387
Well, accept it or not,
the reality is

01:26.487 --> 01:28.322
Alex got into the Naval Academy.

01:28.422 --> 01:30.758
And he told us nothing about it?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.092
Mm-hmm.

01:32.193 --> 01:34.495
I mean, it's a whole process.
It requires

01:34.595 --> 01:36.230
a-a fitness test,
an interview...

01:36.330 --> 01:38.366
Recommendation letter.

01:38.466 --> 01:39.867
All without us knowing.

01:39.967 --> 01:41.669
Well, I've got a new baby
and sleep deprivation.

01:41.769 --> 01:42.936
What's your excuse?

01:43.036 --> 01:46.174
Daniel, please, let's not fight.

01:46.274 --> 01:48.041
I'm sorry.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.511
I mean, maybe he's pissed
that I'm not around?

01:50.611 --> 01:52.513
So he joined the Navy?

01:52.613 --> 01:54.615
It's a workable theory.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.150
It's a self-centered theory.

01:56.250 --> 01:57.351
I thought we weren't fighting.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.187
Look, he's 18.

01:59.287 --> 02:01.189
He may not be aware
of what he's committing to,

02:01.289 --> 02:02.356
so we reason with him.

02:02.456 --> 02:04.292
Show him why
this might not be

02:04.392 --> 02:05.993
the best path
for him.

02:06.093 --> 02:08.429
Work together, okay?

02:09.497 --> 02:10.831
Okay.

02:10.931 --> 02:13.634
But first, I'm gonna find out
who helped him get in.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.236
Daniel...
I want to know

02:15.336 --> 02:19.473
who my son feels more
comfortable talking to than me.

02:21.175 --> 02:22.543
Okay.

02:22.643 --> 02:25.446
Good talk.

02:27.248 --> 02:32.486
Special Agent in Charge
Jane Tennant, always at work.

02:32.586 --> 02:35.289
Captain Joe Milius,

02:35.389 --> 02:38.326
never one to call first. Sorry.

02:38.426 --> 02:40.761
Things have been hectic.

02:40.861 --> 02:42.996
Securing democracy
for the world and all.

02:43.096 --> 02:45.899
Is securing democracy
why you're here?

02:45.999 --> 02:47.735
Yeah.

02:47.835 --> 02:49.870
Matter of national security.

02:49.970 --> 02:51.605
Need help.
Well, then

02:51.705 --> 02:53.907
let me round up
the team.

02:56.844 --> 02:59.947
Joe, national
security, remember?

03:00.047 --> 03:03.784
I mean, national security
can wait maybe a minute longer.

03:06.920 --> 03:08.689
Right.

03:09.890 --> 03:13.026
It'll take longer
without both hands.

03:17.164 --> 03:19.199
It is good to see you.

03:21.235 --> 03:23.003
And we need to catch up.

03:23.103 --> 03:25.439
I know. I've been...

03:25.539 --> 03:27.174
deep in it.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.043
And I'm sorry for not sending
my congratulations earlier, but

03:30.143 --> 03:32.145
congratulations.

03:32.246 --> 03:33.881
Congratulations on what?

03:33.981 --> 03:36.517
Alex getting into Annapolis.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.887
That's huge.
You must be so proud.

03:39.987 --> 03:43.691
Or... you're having a stroke. Mm.

03:43.791 --> 03:46.894
I'm sorry, just... catching up.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.863
You wrote Alex
his recommendation.

03:49.963 --> 03:51.965
Alex didn't tell you?
No.

03:52.065 --> 03:55.002
I actually didn't know he
applied until he got accepted.

03:55.969 --> 03:58.205
This got very awkward very fast.

04:00.674 --> 04:02.443
Ready, boss.
Right. I'll be right out.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.211
We will table this.

04:08.148 --> 04:10.818
Okay. We're here.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.986
Where's the other one-- Laci?

04:13.086 --> 04:13.987
Lucy.
Lucy.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.423
Right.

04:15.523 --> 04:17.224
She's at tactical training,
so we're good to go.

04:18.792 --> 04:21.061
Two nights ago, a couple
transnational criminals

04:21.161 --> 04:22.730
were gunned down
at a Bangkok club.

04:22.830 --> 04:25.399
Vince Cooper
and his associate.

04:25.499 --> 04:28.068
Who's Vince Cooper?
Accountant

04:28.168 --> 04:30.203
for Dante Reeves.

04:30.304 --> 04:32.740
The billionaire?
There's a rumor that he makes

04:32.840 --> 04:35.042
most of his money
as a global arms dealer.

04:35.142 --> 04:36.344
More than a rumor.

04:36.444 --> 04:38.211
Reeves has sold to every
bad actor on the planet.

04:38.312 --> 04:39.647
A joint FBI-DoD task force

04:39.747 --> 04:41.649
has been after
him for years.

04:41.749 --> 04:43.016
Vince Cooper
was gonna cooperate.

04:43.116 --> 04:45.252
Reeves took him out
before he could.

04:45.353 --> 04:47.154
But Reeves left a loose end.

04:47.254 --> 04:49.189
Another potentially
high-value informant.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.859
Where's this informant now?
On island.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.794
Claims there's
a flash drive here

04:53.894 --> 04:55.162
with a complete rundown

04:55.262 --> 04:56.897
of all Dante Reeves'
illegal activities.

04:56.997 --> 04:59.367
So, you want us to
secure the intel.

04:59.467 --> 05:02.470
FBI is taking operational
control of that part,

05:02.570 --> 05:03.837
led by ASAC Curtis.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.739
You need us to help locate
Dante Reeves?

05:05.839 --> 05:08.008
DIA has already
compiled a dossier

05:08.108 --> 05:09.677
on his movements
and current activities.

05:09.777 --> 05:12.513
Okay, what do you want us to do?

05:12.613 --> 05:15.383
Protection for the informant

05:15.483 --> 05:19.152
until the deal is done
and the intel is retrieved.

05:19.252 --> 05:20.354
So, babysit?

05:20.454 --> 05:22.022
A little more
involved than that.

05:22.122 --> 05:23.924
We take the informant to
a safe house, feed

05:24.024 --> 05:25.659
and water them, make sure they
show up to their appointments.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.195
That's babysitting.
Dangerous babysitting.

05:28.295 --> 05:30.431
Reeves will 100%
try to take the asset out.

05:30.531 --> 05:32.232
And there's no team
better to protect

05:32.332 --> 05:34.334
the most substantial informant

05:34.435 --> 05:37.004
that we have had in years.

05:43.477 --> 05:47.014
One of you will be able to
get me a proper coffee, right?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.683
<i>So, Adriana,</i>

05:49.783 --> 05:51.318
we flew you
from Bangkok to Hawai'i.

05:51.419 --> 05:53.821
I suppose that was
technically a plane.

05:53.921 --> 05:57.257
We're protecting you
and putting you up,

05:57.357 --> 06:01.061
and now you're gonna tell us
where this flash drive is.

06:01.161 --> 06:03.497
Not quite yet.

06:03.597 --> 06:05.799
I have a list of requests.

06:05.899 --> 06:08.068
Requests.
Demands.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.169
Whatever.

06:09.269 --> 06:11.271
This is ridiculous.

06:11.371 --> 06:12.906
A girl needs what a girl needs.

06:13.006 --> 06:15.375
I mean, if the government

06:15.476 --> 06:17.845
still wants that flash drive.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.852
Adriana Velazco,

06:24.952 --> 06:27.821
this is Special Agent Boone
and Special Agent Holman.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.922
What's up, guys?

06:29.022 --> 06:30.491
Uh, we're taking you

06:30.591 --> 06:32.125
to a safe house.

06:32.225 --> 06:36.163
Actually, I think we got
a few errands to run first.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.832
This is a shopping list.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.333
Mani-pedi, too.

06:40.434 --> 06:42.402
Look, just get it done,
and get it done fast.

06:42.503 --> 06:45.673
Anything you say, boss.

06:45.773 --> 06:47.340
I hope the government car
is better

06:47.441 --> 06:49.242
than the government plane.

06:52.079 --> 06:53.346
You owe me big for this.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.949
I know. I'm sorry.
I will make it up to you.

06:56.049 --> 06:57.384
Dinner?
No, no, no.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.587
Dinner is not gonna cut it.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.923
I actually was gonna ask you
to come to the house tonight.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.892
Don't get excited.

07:04.992 --> 07:06.694
We're sitting
down with Alex.

07:06.794 --> 07:08.796
Okay.
Yeah.

07:08.896 --> 07:11.098
I figured he'd want
to thank you in person.

07:11.198 --> 07:13.934
Plus, I have a lot of questions
for both of you.

07:15.102 --> 07:18.772
Sounds... fun.
Mm-hmm.

07:27.981 --> 07:29.850
Telling you now,
if she makes us do another lap,

07:29.950 --> 07:31.585
I'm putting in
for early retirement.

07:31.685 --> 07:34.387
There can't possibly
be a store she hasn't hit yet.

07:34.488 --> 07:37.891
Take it from a married man:
there is always another store.

07:37.991 --> 07:40.293
Ooh, there it is.
Look, guys.

07:40.393 --> 07:42.429
Hey, we need
to get back to Pearl.

07:42.530 --> 07:45.132
I thought you guys were tough,
capable special agents.

07:45.232 --> 07:47.801
Uh, we are those-those things.

07:47.901 --> 07:49.036
And you're here to assist me.

07:49.136 --> 07:50.037
We're here to protect you.

07:50.137 --> 07:51.539
You're doing great.

07:51.639 --> 07:52.940
Adriana.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.275
Ugh, it's been years
since I've been to a mall.

07:55.375 --> 07:57.177
I'm usually
a "have the stylist bring

07:57.277 --> 07:59.613
a curated collection to the
suite" kind of gal, you know?

07:59.713 --> 08:02.215
I really don't.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.818
Hey, Vince set that
kind of thing up for you?

08:04.918 --> 08:07.354
Stylist, a hotel suite?

08:07.454 --> 08:09.557
I don't want to talk
about Vince.

08:09.657 --> 08:12.626
The whole reason you're in
Hawai'i is to talk about Vince.
I'm in Hawai'i

08:12.726 --> 08:16.263
to talk about Dante Reeves.
After my deal's set.
You know

08:16.363 --> 08:18.465
whoever killed Vince is probably
looking for you, too.

08:18.566 --> 08:20.467
Do you remember

08:20.568 --> 08:22.636
anything about the guy
who attacked you at the club?

08:22.736 --> 08:24.538
Yeah. Um...

08:25.673 --> 08:28.475
Big guy. Big gun.

08:28.576 --> 08:30.210
There it is.

08:30.310 --> 08:32.345
I'm not going in.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.516
You're holding the bags.

08:37.918 --> 08:40.320
Just...
I don't, I don't
know... Ugh.

08:45.058 --> 08:46.860
How many dresses
does one woman need?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.029
How many aloha shirts
does one man need?

08:49.129 --> 08:51.699
This isn't an aloha shirt.
These aren't dresses.

08:51.799 --> 08:55.502
They're statements of being.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.706
What do you think?

08:58.806 --> 09:00.273
Great. Let's get it. Let's go.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.976
That attitude
explains your whole thing.

09:03.076 --> 09:06.079
You need to relax. Adriana...

09:06.179 --> 09:07.414
Stop saying my name
like you're my dad.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.349
If the other night
taught me anything,

09:09.449 --> 09:11.418
it's that any outfit you
wear could be your last,

09:11.518 --> 09:15.555
which is something you might
consider when you get dressed.

09:20.227 --> 09:22.930
What happened the other night,
yeah, it...

09:23.030 --> 09:26.834
must've been scary,
almost dying.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.370
This isn't the one.

09:30.470 --> 09:33.340
There's an amazing Barbiecore
strapless one near the front.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.676
Could you grab it?

09:35.776 --> 09:37.144
What's Barbiecore?

09:37.244 --> 09:39.913
You'll know when you see it. I...

09:46.987 --> 09:49.322
It's pink.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.127
Why didn't you
just say pink?

09:54.227 --> 09:55.996
Hey.

10:00.333 --> 10:01.902
Jesse, she's flown the coop.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.471
What? How?
Back door.

10:04.571 --> 10:08.108
Okay, I'll come around.
Cut her off.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.277
There's a fire exit that leads
to the parking structure.

10:10.377 --> 10:12.145
I'm not talking about Bangkok.

10:12.245 --> 10:14.247
You have to.
ADRIANA I don't have time.

10:14.347 --> 10:16.349
I need you to tell me about
the list. I need to know.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.052
You know how
secretive Dalton is.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.989
If I could tell you,
I would tell you, but I can't.

10:23.256 --> 10:25.893
What the hell is going on?

10:32.733 --> 10:34.702
You want to explain yourself?

10:34.802 --> 10:37.671
This is my friend Roxanne.
We just ran into each other.

10:37.771 --> 10:39.539
You were in
an empty dressing room.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.374
Yeah, on Insta.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.911
I'm doing a live collab
with my stylist.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.047
I don't know
what any of those words mean.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.515
Obviously.

10:48.615 --> 10:50.984
Look, hey,

10:51.084 --> 10:52.319
you can't just run off.

10:52.419 --> 10:53.921
I'm sorry.
Who are you?

10:54.021 --> 10:57.390
I'm Kai. I'm a...
I'm a friend of Adriana's.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.659
Oh, no, I know
all her friends.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.228
Hey.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.430
Everything okay?

11:03.530 --> 11:05.532
Adriana, what gives?

11:05.632 --> 11:07.434
They're security.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.136
For the mall?

11:09.236 --> 11:11.104
For me.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.305
That's right.

11:12.405 --> 11:13.907
Right now,
we got to go to the car.

11:14.007 --> 11:15.475
You have a limo?

11:15.575 --> 11:17.177
No, it's just a car.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.746
Oh, too bad.

11:18.846 --> 11:21.481
Okay, well, text me
later. We'll hang.

11:21.581 --> 11:23.583
Okay, for sure.

11:25.418 --> 11:28.188
Bring the big one.

11:31.224 --> 11:32.359
What just happened?

11:32.459 --> 11:35.495
Adriana's been holding out
on us. Phone.

11:35.595 --> 11:36.864
Where did you even get that?

11:36.964 --> 11:38.732
What, you don't have
more than one phone?

11:38.832 --> 11:40.133
All right, we're leaving.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.301
You really are a buzzkill.

11:41.401 --> 11:42.335
We're not here for you

11:42.435 --> 11:43.703
to shop and hang with the girls.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.372
You're a cooperating

11:45.472 --> 11:48.608
witness to help take down
the man who almost killed you.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
Not yet I'm not.

11:50.811 --> 11:52.612
And I still need
a mani-pedi.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.114
There's a place upstairs.
Let's get going.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.016
We are not going upstairs.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.318
Why not?

11:58.418 --> 12:00.653
'Cause I know a better place.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.656
No.

12:03.757 --> 12:05.492
Not yet.
I'm working on it.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.160
I haven't even asked anything.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.963
And yet I already know
what you're gonna say. Okay.

12:10.063 --> 12:11.932
Once we have enough evidence
to bring Reeves in,

12:12.032 --> 12:14.434
FBI and DoD need
to locate him, so...

12:14.534 --> 12:16.837
So, no, I haven't
been able to locate him.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.839
At least
not yet. See?

12:18.939 --> 12:21.474
We could have avoided
the whole last exchange.

12:21.574 --> 12:24.411
Efficient. I like it.

12:24.511 --> 12:28.015
I've been diving
into Dante Reeves.

12:29.316 --> 12:31.051
He lives big. Really big.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.420
Mega yachts,
mega jets, mega homes

12:33.520 --> 12:34.454
all over the world.

12:34.554 --> 12:35.856
Any in Hawai'i?
One,

12:35.956 --> 12:37.690
but he hasn't been here
in four years.

12:37.791 --> 12:38.859
Though he has been
to eight countries

12:38.959 --> 12:40.260
in the last two months.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.661
Well, according
to his social media,

12:41.761 --> 12:42.762
his preferred mode

12:42.863 --> 12:44.097
of transport
is private jet,

12:44.197 --> 12:46.399
so maybe focus on that?
Okay.

12:46.499 --> 12:49.036
The only problem
is he has four jets.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.404
All with different itineraries

12:51.504 --> 12:53.874
at any given time.
None on U.S. soil.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.509
We need to figure out which ones

12:56.609 --> 12:59.012
are a decoy
and which ones aren't.

13:02.249 --> 13:04.051
How did you...

13:04.151 --> 13:06.820
Well, FBI's not the only thing
that's predictable.

13:13.894 --> 13:16.096
This place is magic.

13:16.196 --> 13:17.497
Yeah, I told you.

13:17.597 --> 13:19.867
Yeah.
I just didn't buy it.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.302
Because I'm a dude
or 'cause I'm a fed?

13:22.402 --> 13:25.939
Because I'm not
usually surprised by people.

13:27.574 --> 13:30.010
You know, people aren't
always what they seem.

13:30.110 --> 13:33.046
For instance, you pretended
to play dress-up at the mall,

13:33.146 --> 13:36.016
but you were really
waiting to see Roxanne.

13:36.116 --> 13:38.385
There's a great
little cafe near here.

13:38.485 --> 13:39.987
Amazing mochi pancakes.

13:40.087 --> 13:42.655
Yeah, Mama T's.
Local joint.

13:42.755 --> 13:46.226
Hey. Stop avoiding
the subject.

13:46.326 --> 13:48.761
Who's Roxanne?

13:48.862 --> 13:50.430
Exactly who she seems.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.266
You were asking about a list
and someone named Dalton.

13:53.366 --> 13:54.301
It's nothing.

13:54.401 --> 13:57.237
There's a party tomorrow night.

13:57.337 --> 14:01.074
Roxanne's friend Dalton
is throwing it.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.009
That's all.

14:02.109 --> 14:03.977
You want to go to a party?

14:05.478 --> 14:07.614
Right after your friend Vince

14:07.714 --> 14:10.050
was assassinated
in front of you.

14:11.818 --> 14:13.453
Life is for the living.

14:13.553 --> 14:16.456
Isn't this facade tiring?

14:16.556 --> 14:18.926
You haven't mentioned Vince
once, and yet you wince

14:19.026 --> 14:20.560
every time I mention his name.

14:20.660 --> 14:21.828
He was your friend.

14:21.929 --> 14:24.331
I have a lot of friends.

14:24.431 --> 14:27.000
A friend whose death
compelled you to come to us.

14:29.802 --> 14:32.839
I'm scared, okay?

14:32.940 --> 14:35.175
I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time,

14:35.275 --> 14:37.644
and now I'm afraid
Reeves might come after me.

14:37.744 --> 14:40.113
So I'm here with you.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.649
It's self-preservation.
Nothing more.

14:42.749 --> 14:45.318
Okay, so no more running.
No more secret cell phones.

14:45.418 --> 14:48.655
We wrap up here and we go back
to Pearl and we sign your deal.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.757
And then

14:50.857 --> 14:54.161
you can go to as many
parties as you want.

14:54.261 --> 14:55.228
Promise?

14:55.328 --> 14:57.230
I promise.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.339
Hey.
Hey.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.108
I didn't know
what was on the menu,

15:08.208 --> 15:10.944
so I brought red
and white, and then

15:11.044 --> 15:13.246
I saw this cake,
and I thought...
You'd overcompensate?

15:13.346 --> 15:16.583
I'm pretty sure
you're mad at me.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.918
I'm not mad, Joe.
Why do I still

15:19.019 --> 15:21.488
feel so uneasy?
Look, why don't you

15:21.588 --> 15:23.223
finish chopping the veggies,

15:23.323 --> 15:26.093
I'll get you a glass of wine,
and we'll sort out your unease.

15:28.328 --> 15:29.896
Is this how
you break terrorists?

15:29.997 --> 15:32.299
With wine and adobo?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.135
When Alex asked me
for the recommendation,

15:35.235 --> 15:37.770
I just assumed you knew.
And I...

15:37.870 --> 15:39.206
I thought I was
doing a good thing.

15:39.306 --> 15:42.609
Helping my...
friend's son.

15:42.709 --> 15:45.445
Now I realize I should have
done my due diligence.

15:45.545 --> 15:46.713
Make sure you were on board.

15:46.813 --> 15:48.615
Or that I even knew.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.450
Or that you even knew.

15:52.552 --> 15:54.054
Joe.
Mm?

15:54.154 --> 15:57.124
That's small enough.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.293
Clearly, I overstepped,

16:00.393 --> 16:04.264
and I will do whatever
it takes to make it right.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.867
That's how I break terrorists.

16:13.440 --> 16:14.874
Joe?

16:15.775 --> 16:18.711
Alex, man of the hour.

16:18.811 --> 16:21.514
I got something for you,

16:21.614 --> 16:24.151
if it's okay with your mother.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.388
My dad gave this to me

16:28.488 --> 16:31.524
when I was getting
into the Naval Academy.

16:33.493 --> 16:34.994
I want you to have it.

16:39.399 --> 16:40.833
Wow.

16:40.933 --> 16:43.236
This slaps. Thanks.

16:43.336 --> 16:46.339
Slapping is definitely
what I was going for.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.744
Who the hell

16:51.844 --> 16:53.313
is Joe Milius,

16:53.413 --> 16:56.583
and why'd he help our son
get into Annapolis?

16:58.185 --> 16:59.819
That would be me.

17:07.894 --> 17:10.263
Any luck locating Dante Reeves?

17:10.363 --> 17:12.732
Not yet. He's hardly ever
on U.S. soil, and when he is,

17:12.832 --> 17:14.234
we don't even know it
until he's gone.

17:14.334 --> 17:15.702
Ernie's still working on it.

17:15.802 --> 17:18.271
ASAC Curtis wanted an update
on Adriana's deal.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.307
She's working on it
right now.

17:20.407 --> 17:21.341
Without a lawyer?

17:21.441 --> 17:22.975
Said she didn't want one.

17:23.076 --> 17:24.477
Can't say I've ever

17:24.577 --> 17:26.279
seen anyone redline
their own proffer agreement

17:26.379 --> 17:28.681
with a feather-topped pen.

17:28.781 --> 17:30.717
This is, like, the fourth time
she's had them amend it.

17:30.817 --> 17:34.787
I think she's a lot smarter
than most people assume.

17:34.887 --> 17:36.556
Beauty and brains, huh?

17:36.656 --> 17:40.160
Yeah, you know, it's a burden
some of us must carry.

17:43.296 --> 17:46.032
Well, hope
you're right.

17:46.133 --> 17:47.767
Elle Woods there
is our best shot at taking down

17:47.867 --> 17:49.136
a global arms dealer.

17:50.470 --> 17:51.938
Okay, let me know
when she's signed.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.173
Curtis is itching
to move forward. Okay.

17:53.273 --> 17:56.008
We'll keep you updated.

17:56.109 --> 17:58.077
It's a burden, huh?

18:04.984 --> 18:07.687
So, uh...

18:07.787 --> 18:09.156
you and Jane

18:09.256 --> 18:10.190
are...

18:10.290 --> 18:11.791
They hang out. Right.

18:11.891 --> 18:13.626
And by "hang out," we mean...

18:13.726 --> 18:14.961
Look, we're just
friends, Daniel.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.996
Okay, can we focus on Alex?

18:17.096 --> 18:18.631
Oh, I am focused on Alex

18:18.731 --> 18:22.169
and how your friend secretly
got him into the Naval Academy.

18:22.269 --> 18:24.404
I wouldn't classify it
as a secret.

18:24.504 --> 18:28.175
I didn't know about it.
Jane didn't know about it.

18:28.275 --> 18:30.577
How else should we
classify it then?

18:30.677 --> 18:33.012
Fair enough, and I apologize,

18:33.112 --> 18:36.449
again, for mishandling

18:36.549 --> 18:37.717
the situation.

18:37.817 --> 18:39.919
Probably best if I go right now. No.

18:40.019 --> 18:41.688
I want you to stay.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.856
Doesn't feel like a conversation
I should be involved in.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.958
Little late for that, Joe.
Look, this isn't about Joe.

18:46.058 --> 18:49.529
Okay? It's about Alex.
Really?

18:49.629 --> 18:51.864
That's the first
I'm hearing of it.

18:52.732 --> 18:55.835
You want me to be sorry
for not telling you I applied.

18:55.935 --> 18:57.069
But I'm not.

18:57.170 --> 18:58.838
I knew you'd try to stop me

18:58.938 --> 19:00.540
and I wanted to see
if I could do it,

19:00.640 --> 19:02.575
and I could.

19:02.675 --> 19:03.843
You should be proud.

19:03.943 --> 19:05.478
We are proud.

19:05.578 --> 19:07.814
Of course, but do you even

19:07.914 --> 19:09.482
know what you're committing to?

19:09.582 --> 19:11.584
It's not just four
years of college.

19:11.684 --> 19:14.321
You're giving away another
five years of your life.

19:14.421 --> 19:16.122
It's not a prison sentence.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.424
That's not what I'm saying.

19:17.524 --> 19:18.925
It could be a pretty
fulfilling life.

19:19.025 --> 19:20.059
Joe.

19:20.159 --> 19:21.894
I mean, I went to the Academy

19:21.994 --> 19:23.896
and things turned out
pretty well.

19:23.996 --> 19:25.398
See?
What are you doing?

19:25.498 --> 19:27.434
I don't know.
You know, maybe

19:27.534 --> 19:29.969
the question isn't
why I want to do this

19:30.069 --> 19:32.505
but why you two
don't want me to.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.245
<i>She said the flash drive
with the intel</i>

19:38.345 --> 19:39.979
<i>is here
at Vince Cooper's house.</i>

19:40.079 --> 19:41.681
Adriana called it
a crash pad.

19:41.781 --> 19:45.652
Maybe we are
in the wrong business.

19:48.321 --> 19:50.323
Does that look like a... Yeah.

19:50.423 --> 19:52.659
Yeah, it does.
All the money in the world

19:52.759 --> 19:54.394
doesn't buy good taste, huh?

19:54.494 --> 19:58.130
All right. Let's get
the show on the road.

19:58.231 --> 20:01.100
Is-is that a... Oh. Yeah.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.503
It's beautiful, isn't it?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.373
Where's the
main attraction?

20:06.473 --> 20:09.108
Guys, please be careful.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.344
This is a shoes-off house.

20:11.444 --> 20:14.146
Seriously?
Mm-hmm.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.015
Where's the flash drive?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.405
You know the code?

20:38.505 --> 20:40.907
Wouldn't be much good
if I didn't.

20:41.007 --> 20:43.676
No. You wouldn't be much good.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.211
Um...

20:50.350 --> 20:52.151
It's okay, Adriana.

20:52.251 --> 20:56.589
Relax. Take your time.

20:56.689 --> 21:00.092
It's 1980. Vince was obsessed
with <i>Miracle on Ice.</i>

21:00.192 --> 21:02.762
Great film.

21:22.482 --> 21:25.652
What is this?
Not the intel we wanted.

21:29.055 --> 21:30.189
Um...

21:30.289 --> 21:32.525
where's Adriana?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.835
She played us.
We don't know that for sure.

21:42.935 --> 21:44.337
Feels pretty sure, Tennant.

21:44.437 --> 21:45.872
She used
government resources

21:45.972 --> 21:48.040
to get herself out of
Thailand then lured us here

21:48.140 --> 21:50.377
so she could give us the slip.
Could be a mole.

21:50.477 --> 21:53.179
Reeves planted her to see what
kind of intel we have on him.

21:53.279 --> 21:54.947
No, that would be
sloppy of Reeves.

21:55.047 --> 21:56.949
Plus, it doesn't explain
the cat meme on the flash drive

21:57.049 --> 21:58.985
where the intel
was supposed to be.

21:59.085 --> 22:00.720
Searched the property. Nothing.

22:00.820 --> 22:02.088
There's an access road
to the beach.

22:02.188 --> 22:03.923
She slipped right by the agents.

22:04.023 --> 22:06.058
She's in four-inch heels,
couldn't have gotten too far.

22:06.158 --> 22:08.395
Put a BOLO out. I want teams
searching every sushi joint

22:08.495 --> 22:09.662
and nightclub on the island.

22:09.762 --> 22:11.163
Airports and marinas, too.

22:17.537 --> 22:19.238
What is it?

22:19.338 --> 22:20.907
She's not playing us.

22:21.007 --> 22:23.175
At least not in
the way they think.

22:24.110 --> 22:25.645
Okay, what does that mean?

22:25.745 --> 22:28.114
I don't know.
It's a gut feeling.

22:28.214 --> 22:30.983
Does that gut give you an idea
of where she went?

22:39.392 --> 22:41.861
There's a lot of people
looking for you.

22:41.961 --> 22:44.130
But you found me.

22:44.230 --> 22:45.865
Mama T's.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.900
Amazing mochi pancakes.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.769
Oh, you were listening.

22:51.037 --> 22:53.540
Can I finish my pancakes
before you arrest me?

22:53.640 --> 22:55.775
You're not under arrest.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.510
Not yet, at least.

22:57.610 --> 22:59.912
'Cause you like me?

23:00.012 --> 23:02.449
Because I think you were
as surprised as the rest of us

23:02.549 --> 23:04.784
that the drive was empty.

23:04.884 --> 23:06.953
But you have been lying.

23:07.987 --> 23:10.022
You and Vince were close.

23:10.122 --> 23:12.425
I told you, he was a friend.

23:12.525 --> 23:14.360
According to Tennant,
you walked around

23:14.461 --> 23:16.095
like you owned that house.

23:16.195 --> 23:18.531
You knew where everything went.
You knew the code to the safe.

23:18.631 --> 23:19.999
A lot of good it did me.

23:20.099 --> 23:23.069
You know, Vince always
talked about leverage.

23:23.169 --> 23:26.739
Need to have it,
need to protect it,

23:26.839 --> 23:28.708
'cause someday
you might need to use it.

23:28.808 --> 23:29.909
Is that why you ran?

23:30.009 --> 23:32.679
No intel. No leverage.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.413
No one looking out for me.

23:34.514 --> 23:35.782
I'm looking out for you.

23:35.882 --> 23:37.917
That's sweet.

23:38.017 --> 23:39.719
But let's be honest,

23:39.819 --> 23:41.420
the moment I met with you guys,

23:41.521 --> 23:44.190
I gave up any hope
on my old life.

23:48.995 --> 23:50.663
The way I grew up,

23:50.763 --> 23:53.766
Roxanne's world might as well
have been a fairy tale.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.602
And the fact that I got in

23:55.702 --> 23:57.870
and got to stay?

23:57.970 --> 24:00.840
That was freedom.

24:01.641 --> 24:02.642
That was away out.

24:02.742 --> 24:04.844
Hey, Roxanne-- wh...

24:04.944 --> 24:07.614
why were you so desperate
to make contact with her?

24:07.714 --> 24:09.749
There's a big party tonight.

24:09.849 --> 24:11.751
Dalton Ball.

24:11.851 --> 24:13.052
Happens every four years.

24:13.152 --> 24:14.386
Ernie said the last
time that Reeves

24:14.487 --> 24:15.888
was in Hawai'i
was four years ago.

24:15.988 --> 24:18.758
I wanted to see
how close I might be

24:18.858 --> 24:20.960
to the man who almost killed me.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.533
You may just have some
leverage to utilize yet.

24:27.366 --> 24:29.401
As long as you're still
willing to do this.

24:35.708 --> 24:36.943
Hey.

24:37.043 --> 24:39.378
Kai found Adriana.
Bringing her in now.

24:39.478 --> 24:40.780
We're still in the game.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.516
That is good news.

24:46.719 --> 24:49.822
So, last night was...

24:50.890 --> 24:53.225
Yeah. Sorry.

24:54.927 --> 24:57.296
Sure it felt like an ambush.

24:57.396 --> 24:59.899
You know where I learned
to handle ambushes?

24:59.999 --> 25:00.967
Naval Academy.

25:01.067 --> 25:03.335
Well, they taught you well.

25:03.435 --> 25:05.805
Learned a lot
of other stuff there, too.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.640
So would Alex.

25:08.440 --> 25:11.043
I have nothing against
going to Annapolis, okay?

25:11.143 --> 25:12.945
Just not for your son.

25:13.045 --> 25:15.982
It's not the school.

25:16.082 --> 25:17.550
It's the life.

25:18.785 --> 25:20.887
This isn't a job
for us, Joe.

25:20.987 --> 25:24.256
It's a calling.
It's part of who we are.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.793
And Alex, in
the last year,

25:26.893 --> 25:30.462
has gone from baseball
to a gap year

25:30.563 --> 25:33.199
to this.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.967
It's like he's searching
for something.

25:35.067 --> 25:37.236
And his reason for going
needs to be more

25:37.336 --> 25:39.105
than just to see
if he could get in.

25:39.205 --> 25:41.040
I think it might be.

25:42.274 --> 25:44.744
At least based
on his application essay.

25:44.844 --> 25:47.580
You should read it.

25:47.680 --> 25:49.916
We located Reeves.

25:50.016 --> 25:52.084
How?
Adriana was right.

25:52.184 --> 25:54.020
Uh, Reeves was in Hawai'i
four years ago,

25:54.120 --> 25:56.222
same time as the Dalton Ball,

25:56.322 --> 25:59.058
but now he's back.
Landed yesterday morning.

25:59.158 --> 26:00.627
All right, well,
you were tracking all his jets.

26:00.727 --> 26:01.894
None of them were near the U.S.

26:01.994 --> 26:03.295
Because he didn't use
one of his jets.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.964
He bummed a ride
on someone else's.

26:05.064 --> 26:06.833
Where is he exactly?

26:06.933 --> 26:09.836
Now? Mm, no idea.
But tonight...

26:10.970 --> 26:13.873
Looks like we're going
to a party. <i>Okay.</i>

26:13.973 --> 26:15.207
Lay it out
like I don't understand

26:15.307 --> 26:17.476
what the hell is going on.

26:17.576 --> 26:20.479
Dante Reeves snuck onto
the island for the Dalton Ball.

26:20.579 --> 26:23.816
Only happens every four years,
like the World Cup

26:23.916 --> 26:25.217
or leap year.
The theme

26:25.317 --> 26:27.253
is Pele and Poli'ahu.

26:27.353 --> 26:30.589
Pele is the goddess
of new earth, lava,

26:30.690 --> 26:32.191
and flame. Poli'ahu

26:32.291 --> 26:34.293
is a goddess residing
on Mauna Kea,

26:34.393 --> 26:36.395
her domains
include snow and mist.

26:36.495 --> 26:38.865
Dalton reduced it
to "Fire and Ice."

26:38.965 --> 26:40.432
I wish I was surprised by that.

26:40.532 --> 26:44.203
I-It is an insanely
exclusive party, though. But

26:44.303 --> 26:46.072
thanks to Adriana,
we have a way in.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.573
We already have a way in.

26:47.674 --> 26:49.275
If Reeves is there,
we send SWAT to go get him.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.010
No, we don't have enough
evidence to pin anything on him.

26:51.110 --> 26:52.879
Not true.
There's an open warrant

26:52.979 --> 26:54.580
for tax evasion from 2017.

26:54.681 --> 26:56.248
His lawyers will have him
out of custody

26:56.348 --> 26:57.616
before you can blink. But

26:57.717 --> 27:00.452
if we get Reeves on tape
implicating himself

27:00.552 --> 27:02.388
by agreeing to buy
a flash drive,

27:02.488 --> 27:04.523
then we got him on all of
his illegal weapons deals.

27:04.623 --> 27:06.325
You want to hang all this
on some party girl

27:06.425 --> 27:07.827
that already played us?

27:07.927 --> 27:09.395
If it wasn't for Adriana,
we wouldn't even know

27:09.495 --> 27:10.562
Reeves was here.

27:11.563 --> 27:14.366
This is our best chance to take
Reeves off the board for good.

27:14.466 --> 27:17.436
I'm gonna personally
oversee the entire op.

27:18.637 --> 27:20.206
All right, let's do it.

27:31.450 --> 27:32.852
Hey.
Hey.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.357
Was the van always this small?
Huh?

27:38.457 --> 27:40.559
When was the last time
you were in ol' Rusty?

27:42.428 --> 27:44.731
Like, three years ago.
That counterfeiting op.

27:44.831 --> 27:46.232
Oh, yeah.
The Singapore Sting.

27:46.332 --> 27:48.367
Action Jane at her best.

27:48.467 --> 27:50.036
Action what now?

27:50.136 --> 27:52.939
What we used to call you when
you were in the field full-time.

27:53.039 --> 27:55.607
Always jumping off things
and tackling guys.

27:57.676 --> 28:00.179
Got room for me?

28:00.279 --> 28:01.881
Barely.

28:01.981 --> 28:03.282
Curtis send you to babysit us?

28:03.382 --> 28:05.484
Oh, I consider myself
more of a buffer.

28:05.584 --> 28:06.853
Ready to call in
the cavalry. Mm.

28:06.953 --> 28:09.188
Translation,
Curtis is itching to roll.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.490
Yeah, he's a tad nervous.

28:11.590 --> 28:12.959
Button cam's up.

28:13.059 --> 28:14.360
Cam's up, Kai.

28:14.460 --> 28:16.595
You set?

28:18.297 --> 28:21.367
Yeah, boss.
We're about to go in.

28:21.467 --> 28:23.269
You ready?

28:34.346 --> 28:36.816
Hey, uh, we're at a party.

28:36.916 --> 28:38.818
You need to act like
you've been to one before.

28:38.918 --> 28:40.719
I've been to parties.

28:40.820 --> 28:42.688
Okay, prove it.

28:42.789 --> 28:45.424
I don't think I've ever seen
Kai look so nervous.

28:45.524 --> 28:48.227
You know I can hear you, right?

28:48.327 --> 28:50.362
All right, well,
just remember the plan.

28:50.462 --> 28:51.730
Find Reeves, make contact

28:51.831 --> 28:53.332
and get him to make a deal
for the drive.

28:53.432 --> 28:54.333
Yeah.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.367
If anything goes wrong,

28:55.467 --> 28:57.669
code word is "avocado."

28:57.770 --> 29:00.306
Any sign of Reeves?
No, no hits yet.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.474
Though I have identified
at least three guests

29:02.574 --> 29:04.944
wanted for tax evasion.

29:05.044 --> 29:07.613
Okay, keep your eye
on the prize.
Hey, boss,

29:07.713 --> 29:09.015
I got something

29:09.115 --> 29:11.851
Yeah, two hard dudes,
crew cut, ponytail.

29:11.951 --> 29:13.786
Clearly packing.
And I recognize one of 'em

29:13.886 --> 29:15.888
from Reeves'
surveillance photos.

29:15.988 --> 29:17.256
Can you get a little closer?

29:17.356 --> 29:19.258
See if Reeves is with them.
Hello?

29:19.358 --> 29:20.392
Thirsty girl here.

29:22.161 --> 29:23.529
Uh...

29:23.629 --> 29:24.696
yeah, what can I get you?

29:24.797 --> 29:26.765
Dirty Shirley, extra dirt.

29:26.866 --> 29:29.836
Okay, coming right up.

29:32.571 --> 29:34.540
Wait, I know you.

29:34.640 --> 29:37.609
No, I don't think so.

29:37.709 --> 29:39.745
I do.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.783
Yacht party. Lake Como, right?

29:46.352 --> 29:47.586
Guilty.

29:47.686 --> 29:50.456
I never forget a handsome face.

29:50.556 --> 29:52.191
There you go.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.595
Got eyes on the hard dudes.

29:56.695 --> 29:57.796
Any sign of Reeves?

29:57.897 --> 30:00.432
He's with someone.
I can't see who.

30:00.532 --> 30:02.168
Best way around is through.

30:04.736 --> 30:07.273
Come on.

30:08.407 --> 30:09.675
Got nothing.

30:09.775 --> 30:13.779

31:06.032 --> 31:07.799
Just want to say hi
to my friend.

31:07.900 --> 31:10.302
I have a message for you
from Vince Cooper

31:10.402 --> 31:11.938
about Boyacá.

31:15.374 --> 31:17.743
Can't believe it.

31:17.843 --> 31:18.877
Reeves
didn't bite.

31:20.012 --> 31:21.213
You think he's onto us?

31:21.313 --> 31:22.949
If he was, he would be
halfway to his plane.

31:23.049 --> 31:24.850
That's what ASAC Curtis
is worried about.

31:24.951 --> 31:26.085
He wants to go in now.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.553
If we go in now,
we give up the game.

31:27.653 --> 31:29.188
There's not much game left.

31:36.628 --> 31:37.896
Kai, pull Adriana out of there.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.933
FBI's moving in.
Copy, boss.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.836
He wants to see you.

31:44.937 --> 31:45.972
Reeves?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.306
Let's go.

32:03.122 --> 32:05.124
Game is back on, boss.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.559
Okay, great.
Listen, get in there quick,

32:07.659 --> 32:10.562
make the deal and get out.
No surprises.

32:15.167 --> 32:16.802
There might be one surprise.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.345
Kai?

32:26.445 --> 32:27.513
We should go in.

32:27.613 --> 32:30.116
Hold off.
Give him a second.

32:30.216 --> 32:31.650
Adriana, where'd
you get the gun?

32:31.750 --> 32:33.052
From Vince's place.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.187
I need to make Reeves pay.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.556
Not for the weapons.

32:37.656 --> 32:41.093
For Vince, 'cause he was
more than a friend.

32:41.193 --> 32:43.729
Right?

32:43.829 --> 32:46.999
He saw me.

32:47.099 --> 32:50.936
And not just as some twit
in a party dress.

32:51.037 --> 32:53.339
He took care of me.

32:53.439 --> 32:55.174
And I couldn't
take care of him back.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.943
So you'll kill Reeves instead?
That's the plan.

32:58.044 --> 33:00.079
You really think that's
what Vince would have wanted?

33:00.179 --> 33:01.280
'Cause I don't.

33:01.380 --> 33:02.848
You didn't know him.
No, I know enough.

33:02.948 --> 33:05.484
I know you reached out
to the government to make a deal

33:05.584 --> 33:08.187
to take Reeves down.

33:08.287 --> 33:12.124
After years of working for him,
and he did that to protect you.

33:14.226 --> 33:16.062
So give me the gun.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.535
Let's do it right.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.275
Kai, answer me
or we are coming in.

33:29.375 --> 33:30.542
It's all good, boss.

33:30.642 --> 33:32.911
It's all good.
We're back on track.

33:42.254 --> 33:43.989
Adriana.

33:44.090 --> 33:47.626
Please come in.

33:51.230 --> 33:53.865
You'll take your jacket off now.

33:58.204 --> 33:59.871
Wait, what happened?

33:59.971 --> 34:01.673
I lost the button cam feed.

34:01.773 --> 34:03.242
My guy's gonna

34:03.342 --> 34:04.876
take your gun.
All right, we
still go audio,

34:04.976 --> 34:07.113
but Kai's not giving the signal.
Maybe he can't.

34:07.213 --> 34:10.682
All right, we're unarmed.
Now can we talk?

34:10.782 --> 34:11.817
Jesse, post up by
the elevator.

34:11.917 --> 34:12.951
We need to be ready to go.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.486
Keep monitoring
the conversation.

34:14.586 --> 34:15.521
Whistler, with me.

34:15.621 --> 34:18.157
So, Boyacá.

34:18.257 --> 34:19.758
What do you know?

34:19.858 --> 34:21.393
Two warring cartels

34:21.493 --> 34:23.162
and the federal police.

34:23.262 --> 34:25.797
You're arming all of them.

34:25.897 --> 34:29.435
It's a lucrative deal.
Eighty million so far.

34:29.535 --> 34:31.403
You've read a newspaper.

34:31.503 --> 34:32.804
Newspapers don't know about

34:32.904 --> 34:35.474
the casinos you use
to launder your money

34:35.574 --> 34:37.709
or the dollar amounts
of the deposits.

34:39.044 --> 34:39.945
And you are?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.680
Guy who's got the flash drive.

34:41.780 --> 34:44.783
And it's yours for ten million.

34:46.852 --> 34:49.755
You look familiar.
Couldn't place it.

34:49.855 --> 34:52.124
Just another pretty
face, I thought.

34:52.224 --> 34:54.160
But you were Vince's girl.

34:54.260 --> 34:56.795
Yeah, he liked you.

34:56.895 --> 34:59.064
He told you things.

34:59.165 --> 35:00.766
Things like if
anything went wrong,

35:00.866 --> 35:03.835
you could protect yourself
with the flash drive.

35:03.935 --> 35:06.938
Hidden in the safe,
behind the painting.

35:07.038 --> 35:09.741
Yeah.

35:09.841 --> 35:11.710
We wiped it two days ago.

35:11.810 --> 35:14.513
He wasn't as clever
as he thought.

35:14.613 --> 35:17.082
And neither are you.

35:19.551 --> 35:20.586
Avocado!

35:25.357 --> 35:27.793
Out of the way, tough guy.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.414
So you do remember me.

35:48.514 --> 35:50.516
Adriana's hot bodyguard. Duh.

35:50.616 --> 35:54.286
We need to get up
to Kai now.

35:54.386 --> 35:55.421
You need a key.

35:55.521 --> 35:56.588
The guy I knocked out has one

35:56.688 --> 35:58.224
in his back pocket.

36:05.130 --> 36:06.665
You're welcome.

36:23.982 --> 36:25.517
What are you
doing there, sweetie?

36:25.617 --> 36:27.519
What I came here to do.

36:27.619 --> 36:29.221
Adriana, put it down.

36:30.656 --> 36:32.291
You really gonna kill me?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.760
Just like you had Vince killed.
Yeah, he did.

36:34.860 --> 36:36.695
He did, but we got him now.

36:36.795 --> 36:40.165
No. No, I've watched
guys like this

36:40.266 --> 36:43.702
get out of trouble
time and time again,

36:43.802 --> 36:45.637
and I'm sick of it.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.708
Money always wins.

36:50.576 --> 36:53.011
But not when you're dead.

36:54.513 --> 36:56.282
He's not worth it.

36:58.284 --> 37:00.652
He's not-he's not worth it,
Adriana. Put it down.

37:04.790 --> 37:06.258
You're right.

37:16.568 --> 37:17.769
You two good?

37:17.869 --> 37:20.439
Do you-do you have enough
to put him away?

37:20.539 --> 37:22.173
You actually have the
names of the casinos

37:22.274 --> 37:24.543
and the dollar amounts
of the deposits?
Yeah, I-I...

37:24.643 --> 37:26.712
I just remember numbers
like that.

37:26.812 --> 37:28.547
Wait, what about
bank account numbers?

37:28.647 --> 37:30.215
Aah!
Yeah.

37:30.316 --> 37:32.551
Does that help?

37:32.651 --> 37:34.786
It does.

37:34.886 --> 37:36.688
Reeves is done.

37:39.190 --> 37:40.359
Then I'm good.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.336
FBI escort's downstairs,

37:50.436 --> 37:52.771
and they'll take you
to D.C. in the morning.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.541
More one-star treatment?

37:55.641 --> 37:57.108
Probably.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.811
Tell 'em everything you know
about Reeves' business,

37:59.911 --> 38:03.415
and he goes away.

38:03.515 --> 38:04.783
You get your life back.

38:04.883 --> 38:07.553
Such as it is.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.555
I'm starting from scratch.

38:09.655 --> 38:13.425
It's not as bad as it sounds.

38:15.827 --> 38:17.396
You look good in that suit,
by the way.

38:17.496 --> 38:18.497
Oh?
Yeah.

38:18.597 --> 38:19.965
Very double-O.
Oh, yeah?

38:20.065 --> 38:22.501
The dried blood really
ties it all together?

38:22.601 --> 38:24.770
For sure.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.239
Hey, you did great.

38:28.340 --> 38:29.408
It was fun.

38:29.508 --> 38:32.010
Almost getting killed?
Is that...

38:32.110 --> 38:34.446
No, no, the other part.

38:34.546 --> 38:35.847
When we were on the dance floor.

38:35.947 --> 38:37.516
Oh.
You got moves.

38:37.616 --> 38:38.850
Oh, yeah.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.119
You sound surprised.
I am.

38:41.219 --> 38:45.424
I am, but as you know,
I like that.

38:53.865 --> 38:55.434
So...

38:56.835 --> 38:59.037
I'll, uh...

39:03.675 --> 39:04.943
I'm surprising, too.

39:05.043 --> 39:07.713
Yeah.

39:07.813 --> 39:11.383
Take care of yourself,
Kai Holman.

39:19.057 --> 39:20.158
<i>So,</i>

39:20.258 --> 39:21.793
are you sticking around town?

39:21.893 --> 39:24.396
I don't fly out till morning.

39:24.496 --> 39:25.997
Want to grab dinner?

39:26.097 --> 39:28.400
It is morning, Joe.

39:28.500 --> 39:30.702
It's 3:00 a.m. Right.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.471
But if you stick around,

39:32.571 --> 39:34.372
I'll buy you breakfast.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.008
Sure.

39:37.108 --> 39:38.343
Two conditions.

39:38.444 --> 39:40.712
Conditions?

39:40.812 --> 39:42.414
you have to tell me
if Julie asks you

39:42.514 --> 39:44.483
to help her get into
a service academy.

39:45.851 --> 39:48.053
Done. Number two?

39:49.154 --> 39:53.058
Give me a heads-up before
you come in town next time.

39:53.158 --> 39:55.026
We can have a proper reunion.

39:57.996 --> 39:59.565
Proper, huh?

40:02.267 --> 40:04.069
What does that
look like?

40:04.169 --> 40:07.873
Guess you'll just
have to find out.

40:15.146 --> 40:16.848
Morning.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.518
I, uh, brought
coffee and breakfast.

40:19.618 --> 40:22.053
Please, I definitely
am not up for round three.

40:22.153 --> 40:23.622
No, no more fighting.

40:23.722 --> 40:27.025
This is a peace offering.

40:27.125 --> 40:29.895
Past few days
haven't been my finest.

40:29.995 --> 40:32.998
Mine either.
Thank you.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.733
I'll take a coffee.
Of course.

40:34.833 --> 40:38.537
I brought one
for Captain America, too,

40:38.637 --> 40:39.771
if he's around.

40:39.871 --> 40:42.007
He's at the airport.

40:42.107 --> 40:44.476
But that's very nice of you.

40:44.576 --> 40:45.877
Probably.

40:48.146 --> 40:50.348
He seems like a solid guy.

40:52.518 --> 40:55.186
Maybe I was just
a little jealous.

40:55.286 --> 40:56.922
Of Joe?

40:57.756 --> 41:00.025
No, not Joe.

41:01.426 --> 41:02.628
You.

41:04.262 --> 41:06.532
For practically
all of Alex's life

41:06.632 --> 41:08.667
he's wanted to play ball,
be in sports, like me.

41:08.767 --> 41:12.237
Then all of a sudden
he wants this whole other thing,

41:12.337 --> 41:14.005
like you.

41:17.543 --> 41:19.177
What's this?

41:19.277 --> 41:23.014
That is Alex's
personal statement.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.817
Captain America gave it to me.

41:25.917 --> 41:27.318
You read it?
Yeah.

41:27.418 --> 41:29.988
He said that I inspired him

41:30.088 --> 41:32.824
to look to a life of service.

41:32.924 --> 41:35.927
Be a part of something
bigger than himself.

41:36.027 --> 41:40.431
But that he couldn't even
contemplate that

41:40.532 --> 41:45.303
without the principles
of discipline and teamwork

41:45.403 --> 41:48.273
that he learned from his father.

41:52.878 --> 41:54.880
Alex said all that?
He did.

41:54.980 --> 41:58.684
There's some other nice things
in there, too.

42:00.619 --> 42:03.221
Hey.

42:03.321 --> 42:04.590
Dad.

42:04.690 --> 42:06.692
Hey.

42:06.792 --> 42:08.359
What's up?

42:08.459 --> 42:10.829
I was thinking
we could all talk.

42:10.929 --> 42:13.431
About Annapolis?
Yeah.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.401
And what it might look like
if you decide to go.

42:21.239 --> 42:23.842
I'll get some plates.

42:23.942 --> 42:26.044
Okay.

42:26.144 --> 42:28.914
So, you know that
they have winter

42:29.014 --> 42:32.117
in Maryland, right?
