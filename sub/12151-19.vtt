00:01.929 --> 00:02.979
Previously:

00:03.729 --> 00:05.480
We're back. What happened?

00:05.530 --> 00:07.530
- Wes thought Angel--
- Was gonna kill Connor.

00:07.929 --> 00:12.250
When he left with that child,
he wasn't planning on coming back.

00:15.730 --> 00:19.140
- The portal led to Quor-toth.
- There're no portals to Quor-toth.

00:19.329 --> 00:21.890
Going to Quor-toth
would require dark magics.

00:22.329 --> 00:24.649
We don't have the resources
to conjure that dark power.

00:25.329 --> 00:27.399
I think we do.

00:28.329 --> 00:30.399
Lilah, give him anything he wants.

00:31.329 --> 00:34.770
You're messing with primordial
powers of darkness here.

00:39.729 --> 00:42.710
- Where is he?
- You don't want to do this.

00:43.329 --> 00:44.310
Lilah!

00:46.929 --> 00:49.810
- They found Wesley?
- He's not out of the woods yet.

00:49.929 --> 00:51.369
Your being here can help.

00:52.329 --> 00:54.609
You took my son!
I'll never forgive you!

00:55.329 --> 00:57.469
I'm so sorry.

01:13.329 --> 01:17.750
Angel, you and I have fought
side by side on more than one occasion.

01:18.730 --> 01:21.120
Fellow warriors, shoulder to shoulder.

01:21.730 --> 01:24.569
By now, my counsel
must assuredly hold weight.

01:24.730 --> 01:28.239
- So I beseech you to heed my words.
- Okay.

01:28.930 --> 01:32.409
Pomegranate Mist is the wrong
color for this room.

01:34.329 --> 01:35.379
What?

01:35.530 --> 01:38.689
We thought-- Actually,
I thought, and Groo agreed...

01:39.730 --> 01:42.500
...that since you have
to repaint the room anyway...

01:42.730 --> 01:45.189
...maybe you'd like a change,
for a change.

01:45.730 --> 01:48.780
- Groo agreed?
- Don't mock. He has good color sense.

01:49.329 --> 01:54.250
Sunburst Splendor is a hue
more worthy of a champion.

01:55.329 --> 01:58.489
Or perhaps this unique one
called "Pur-plah."

01:58.930 --> 02:02.859
Purple. Yet you have no problems
pronouncing "pomegranate."

02:03.730 --> 02:06.750
- It was my mother's name.
- What are the odds.

02:07.930 --> 02:11.229
- Hang on. Where you going with that?
- Tossing it.

02:12.129 --> 02:14.340
- It's an antique.
- It's charcoal.

02:14.530 --> 02:17.969
We're not throwing it out.
The wall color stays too.

02:18.729 --> 02:22.099
Look, guys, I really appreciate
everybody's help...

02:22.930 --> 02:27.639
...but I just want everything back
to the way it was. Or close to it.

02:28.330 --> 02:30.500
Not gonna be, you know.

02:31.330 --> 02:35.750
Unless we pay for dishonest-to-goodness
contractors, those cracks will stay.

02:36.129 --> 02:37.180
- Let them.
- Sure.

02:37.930 --> 02:40.389
Maybe we can even dump our trash here.

02:40.930 --> 02:43.949
The old gives-the-place-
character philosophy.

02:44.530 --> 02:48.599
Guess that served you pretty well,
living in rotted-out mansions and....

02:52.330 --> 02:54.819
I don't know why
I bought this for him.

02:58.330 --> 03:02.330
It was a whim, I guess.
Thought he'd like to look at it.

03:04.330 --> 03:09.039
Snow. Doesn't ever snow
in Southern California.

03:10.330 --> 03:12.150
It did once.

03:15.729 --> 03:19.729
We shouldn't waste time fixing up
my place when we have work to do.

03:20.530 --> 03:21.969
What work?

03:22.330 --> 03:24.539
Our jobs. The business.

03:25.930 --> 03:27.750
We're neglecting our cases.

03:28.330 --> 03:31.000
Angel, we don't have any cases.

03:31.330 --> 03:33.889
We haven't had a call in over a week.

03:34.330 --> 03:38.090
Really? Well, somebody
ought to be downstairs...

03:39.129 --> 03:42.319
...in case a walk-in should...walk in.

03:43.330 --> 03:46.770
Because we get those sometimes.

03:48.129 --> 03:49.639
Never on Sundays.

03:58.930 --> 03:59.979
Hello?

04:06.129 --> 04:08.379
Angel Investigations?

04:18.730 --> 04:20.170
Hey!

04:21.730 --> 04:23.589
Anybody here?

04:24.730 --> 04:27.889
Hey! Hello?

04:30.129 --> 04:33.639
Look, unless you want me
to take my business elsewhere....

04:34.329 --> 04:37.810
Fine. Probably couldn't
find my dog anyway.

04:42.129 --> 04:45.180
Yes! Hi. I hope that you weren't....

04:47.529 --> 04:49.139
May I help you?

04:49.930 --> 04:50.980
What was that?

04:52.329 --> 04:55.699
I was just saying, if you're looking
for Angel Investigations, I'm he.

04:55.930 --> 04:58.420
Him. Angel. And you are?

04:59.529 --> 05:01.040
I, uh....

05:03.730 --> 05:04.779
I need....

05:04.930 --> 05:08.930
Don't be embarrassed. Whatever your
problems are, I'm here to listen.

05:09.730 --> 05:12.500
- And, you know, help, of course.
- We have to go.

05:13.329 --> 05:15.720
What? Is there something wrong?

05:16.930 --> 05:20.019
The pentagram. Don't worry.
That's an old case.

05:20.529 --> 05:24.740
That's done. I'm totally here
to give you my...full attention.

06:24.449 --> 06:27.009
When did we get the statue
for the lobby?

06:27.449 --> 06:29.269
It's just you.

06:30.449 --> 06:33.639
Can we get rid of this stain?
It scared off a client.

06:34.050 --> 06:36.889
I think he was a client.
He barely said two words then ran out.

06:37.649 --> 06:41.899
Well, you know, some people
can be pretty close-mouthed.

06:43.649 --> 06:48.149
We've never talked about everything
that happened while I was away.

06:49.050 --> 06:52.529
- You know the gist of it.
- I got loads of gist.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.389
What I don't got is the specifics.

06:55.649 --> 06:59.230
Specifically, that five-pointed
doodad decorating our lobby...

06:59.850 --> 07:02.519
...and the voodoo that
you dood-- Did over it.

07:03.449 --> 07:05.550
- Cordy--
- I know you don't wanna talk...

07:05.850 --> 07:08.899
...but don't mess with dark magics
like it doesn't matter.

07:09.449 --> 07:12.779
- It was a waste of time.
- I should know what spell it was.

07:13.649 --> 07:16.560
There's a cosmic price
for using primordial powers.

07:16.649 --> 07:18.329
There could be repercussions.

07:19.050 --> 07:23.259
And the one person who could help us
with that isn't around anymore.

07:23.850 --> 07:26.310
Not going there. Just saying....

07:26.850 --> 07:29.939
Run away, avoid talking about this,
but you know...

07:30.449 --> 07:34.629
...stuff we do in the past comes back
to bite us in our respective ass-i.

07:35.250 --> 07:38.230
- What you did--
- So I wasn't thinking too clearly.

07:38.850 --> 07:40.920
I was drunk on my own son's blood...

07:41.850 --> 07:44.620
...slipped into my food
by Wolfram & Hart.

07:44.850 --> 07:49.240
And my head was clouded with rage over
a trusted friend stealing my child.

07:50.250 --> 07:53.550
Damn it, Cordelia,
you got me talking about this.

07:53.850 --> 07:56.170
You probably just needed to vent.

08:04.050 --> 08:06.149
Why didn't you call me?

08:07.050 --> 08:09.819
I didn't want to mess up
your vacation.

08:10.649 --> 08:13.279
I just thought one of us
should be happy.

08:14.250 --> 08:17.410
But I could've helped.
I could've done something.

08:17.850 --> 08:20.970
- There was nothing you could--
- How do you know that?

08:22.050 --> 08:25.980
What makes you so sure? I've got
a hotline to The fricking Powers.

08:26.250 --> 08:28.639
I could've gotten a vision to warn us.

08:29.250 --> 08:33.750
Plus, I've got demon in me now. So
maybe there is some untapped power...

08:34.649 --> 08:38.230
...that could've help find Connor
before, you know, before....

08:42.450 --> 08:46.769
- Who needed to vent?
- I should've been here for you.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.850
You were. I mean, you are.
You're always--

08:50.850 --> 08:54.500
Look, I'm just trying to move on
like you told me to.

08:55.049 --> 08:59.049
I'm just trying not to just be so
into my problems, into my head.

08:59.850 --> 09:04.769
Just focus on something else
for a while, you know?

09:06.450 --> 09:09.259
Sure. Yeah, I get that.

09:11.850 --> 09:14.200
But next time, you call me.

09:16.649 --> 09:18.259
All right.

09:20.850 --> 09:24.039
There is something you can do for me.

09:24.450 --> 09:27.080
Find me a case to work on. Please.

09:40.009 --> 09:41.549
More. Like the last ones.

09:41.809 --> 09:44.649
Not to be rude,
but you've been here six hours.

09:45.409 --> 09:48.600
- And, like, 100 peach smoothies.
- You're not well, sir.

09:49.009 --> 09:51.149
You haven't taken a whiz yet.

09:51.409 --> 09:53.799
- Please.
- We don't take credit cards.

09:54.409 --> 09:57.639
- Water! Water, then!
- Leave, or I'll call the police.

09:58.610 --> 10:00.779
- We're thirsty!
- Okay.

10:02.809 --> 10:05.440
I hear congratulations are in order.

10:06.409 --> 10:10.240
Gavin. What a pleasant surprise.

10:11.210 --> 10:14.929
People are saying you've made
great strides forward with Angel.

10:15.409 --> 10:18.149
- What are you talking about?
- You don't know?

10:18.409 --> 10:21.320
He tried to kill one of his people
at a hospital.

10:22.009 --> 10:24.679
Gav, you're quick.
Maybe your next news flash...

10:25.610 --> 10:28.730
...will involve that newfangled
invention called fire.

10:29.210 --> 10:32.860
Despite our differences, when
a coworker pats you on the back--

10:33.409 --> 10:35.269
I check for the knife.

10:36.409 --> 10:38.480
Angel tried to kill a human...

10:39.409 --> 10:42.740
...bringing him one step closer
to his dark side and to us.

10:43.009 --> 10:45.990
Dark side, shmark side.
Remember a year ago?

10:46.610 --> 10:49.559
- Wine cellar? Slaughter?
- They were lawyers.

10:50.210 --> 10:51.960
- And you are...?
- A realist.

10:52.610 --> 10:56.230
Angel tried to smother a friend.
We're making progress.

10:56.809 --> 11:00.110
We could make more. Get them
together again, see what happens.

11:00.409 --> 11:03.360
Might even make up
for you losing that baby.

11:04.009 --> 11:06.919
Nice try. But unlike you,
I'm ahead of the game.

11:07.610 --> 11:11.190
Angel tried to kill his friend,
kidnapped and tortured Linwood...

11:11.809 --> 11:14.759
...and performed forbidden magics.
All on my watch.

11:15.409 --> 11:18.740
- Congratulations, Lilah.
- Thanks, Gavin.

11:19.610 --> 11:21.679
- Can we stop feigning now?
- Sure.

11:26.370 --> 11:27.419
It's funny.

11:29.370 --> 11:31.120
Sad, actually.

11:32.970 --> 11:35.389
I keep expecting to find--

11:35.970 --> 11:38.360
It's weird seeing Angel at that desk.

11:38.970 --> 11:41.950
It was his when I came.
It's right that it's his again.

11:42.570 --> 11:45.830
Yeah, but things have cooled down
a little since....

11:46.169 --> 11:48.870
I'm just saying maybe it's time to....

11:49.769 --> 11:51.840
Look, he doesn't have
to forgive Wesley.

11:52.169 --> 11:54.129
Glad you think so 'cause,
not happening.

11:54.570 --> 12:00.120
Right, he shouldn't.
But isn't there some way...

12:01.169 --> 12:02.960
...to come back from this?

12:02.970 --> 12:07.679
If Wes returns with Connor. Even then,
Angel'd probably kill him on principle.

12:08.970 --> 12:12.090
- You don't really think that.
- He took the man's son.

12:13.169 --> 12:16.289
Probably best we never mention
the guy's name again.

12:25.169 --> 12:28.889
I give up. Tried soaking it out,
tried scrubbing it out.

12:29.970 --> 12:32.919
No question:
We've got ring around the lobby.

12:33.570 --> 12:37.009
I say we toss in the towel
and buy a big-ass throw rug.

12:37.169 --> 12:40.190
- Who's with me?
- That honor is mine, princess.

12:40.769 --> 12:42.210
Oh....

12:45.570 --> 12:50.169
Groo, honey, will you do me a favor
and dump out this bucket? Thanks.

12:50.970 --> 12:52.159
Cordelia.

12:52.169 --> 12:54.200
He's such a sweetie.

12:54.570 --> 12:57.799
- So loyal and loving, like a puppy dog.
- Cordy.

12:58.769 --> 13:02.669
I know, that didn't sound very good,
but he is. A puppy dog.

13:03.570 --> 13:07.259
A sexy, well-built,
go-all-night puppy dog.

13:08.370 --> 13:10.399
- Okay, that sounded worse.
- Cor--

13:10.769 --> 13:15.340
No. You want me to say something
to Angel about Wesley. Sorry.

13:16.169 --> 13:17.820
Can't. Won't.

13:18.570 --> 13:20.389
Why? Why "can't," "won't" you?

13:20.970 --> 13:24.590
You've known them both longer
than anybody. Angel'd listen.

13:25.169 --> 13:28.679
But he doesn't want to,
which is why I won't burden him.

13:29.370 --> 13:33.340
Look, whatever he did, it's Wesley.
You care about him, I know.

13:34.169 --> 13:37.009
Can you imagine his pain?
How bad he's feeling?

13:37.169 --> 13:41.419
Angel's feelings are the only ones
I care about. He's my priority.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.740
I got dosed with demon DNA for him.

13:44.970 --> 13:48.230
I'm semi-demon, and I still
don't know what that means.

13:48.570 --> 13:51.830
The random floaty-ness
and seizure-less visions are keen.

13:52.769 --> 13:54.840
Except it's hard to tell when I'm--

13:55.169 --> 13:57.100
Angel?

13:58.169 --> 14:01.149
- What's going on?
- I'll tell you what's going on.

14:01.169 --> 14:03.340
Big brouhaha at the juice bar.

14:04.169 --> 14:06.730
Light on the "ha-ha."
Some guy's cracking up.

14:08.529 --> 14:11.620
Here, key to the safe.
Take it. Just don't hurt me.

14:15.730 --> 14:18.570
One minute you're there,
shocked-looking. Then:

14:19.330 --> 14:22.279
- You're thrown across the room.
- Can we talk later?

14:22.929 --> 14:25.879
- I'm working.
- Look out. He has Ebola or something.

14:26.529 --> 14:29.370
This Ebola is a weapon
forged in magic?

14:29.529 --> 14:30.970
Forged in monkey poo.

14:31.929 --> 14:36.809
Okay, sir, you want to just
put down the Super Size, or....

14:39.129 --> 14:40.429
I know you.

14:40.929 --> 14:43.179
- You do?
- He came to the office today.

14:43.330 --> 14:46.809
- Didn't mention he was a mummy.
- He's not. He wasn't. He's--

14:47.529 --> 14:51.110
Philip J. Spivey from Inglewood,
according to his license.

14:52.330 --> 14:53.980
Mr. Spivey?

14:54.730 --> 14:56.340
Phil?

14:58.330 --> 15:00.960
Hi. Remember me?

15:01.330 --> 15:05.399
We are just gonna take a walk
to my office across the street...

15:06.129 --> 15:10.980
...and we're gonna figure out
what's what. Sound okay with you?

15:12.730 --> 15:15.570
- We're thirsty!
- I'll take that as a no.

15:18.129 --> 15:20.940
Okay, people.
Looks like we got a case.

15:23.529 --> 15:26.440
Okay, let's get him on the couch.

15:31.929 --> 15:34.139
My God, look at his face.

15:34.929 --> 15:37.700
Fred, do we have any water
in the fridge?

15:37.929 --> 15:40.559
- Few bottles, I think.
- We're gonna need them.

15:41.529 --> 15:43.629
- Lip balm wouldn't hurt either.
- Angel.

15:43.929 --> 15:44.980
"We"?

15:45.730 --> 15:48.570
- Glad you're having fun.
- No, he kept saying "we."

15:48.730 --> 15:51.919
Earlier, it was, "We have to go."
Now it's, "We're thirsty. "

15:52.929 --> 15:56.259
So he's pretentious.
We need to talk about my vision.

15:56.529 --> 15:58.039
- It can wait.
- No, it can't.

15:58.929 --> 16:01.629
You think The Powers
beam me visions for fun?

16:01.929 --> 16:05.340
They tell me when someone's in danger.
That someone is you.

16:06.129 --> 16:09.850
What else is new? I wanna deal
with somebody else's problem.

16:10.330 --> 16:14.830
I wanna deal with Phil of Inglewood,
who came to us this morning for help.

16:15.730 --> 16:19.730
He's who we should be concerned with.
This has nothing to do with me.

16:21.129 --> 16:22.289
You!

16:23.250 --> 16:26.200
This is all happening because of you!

16:27.450 --> 16:29.799
This is all your fault!

16:42.649 --> 16:45.000
- My fault?
- That's what the sandman said.

16:45.649 --> 16:48.629
I was trying to help him.
What'd he say that for?

16:49.250 --> 16:51.250
He didn't. That did.

16:54.049 --> 16:56.960
- Okay, that was a thing.
- A big, ugly slug thing.

16:57.649 --> 16:59.580
- Where'd it go?
- It has vanished.

17:00.049 --> 17:03.769
Just like the glass eels
of the Krag Swamps in UxenBlarg.

17:04.848 --> 17:07.589
- Just making an observation.
- So, what was it?

17:07.848 --> 17:10.200
I don't know what it is
or what it has to do with me.

17:10.848 --> 17:13.200
Um.... Angel....

17:23.450 --> 17:26.680
Not the hunter type.
Can't I just be moral support?

17:27.049 --> 17:30.670
- Hotel's shut tight.
- I don't want anyone else infected.

17:31.849 --> 17:35.289
- This weapon will serve me better.
- Too big for our purposes.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.359
- I've had no complaints.
- Start at the third floor.

17:39.049 --> 17:41.049
- Make a sweep, work your way down.
- Hey.

17:41.450 --> 17:44.680
How do we know slicing and dicing
will kill Mr. Sluggo?

17:45.650 --> 17:49.650
We don't. Fred's gonna hit the books,
see what we're dealing with.

17:50.450 --> 17:53.890
I am? Angel, I don't even know
where to begin to look.

17:54.650 --> 17:56.750
- Start with thaumogenesis.
- Thaumo--?

17:57.049 --> 18:00.170
Creatures manifested
as a byproduct of dark magic.

18:03.049 --> 18:05.259
- I'll stay and keep watch.
- Watch close.

18:05.450 --> 18:08.359
This thing drank the moisture
out of his body.

18:09.049 --> 18:12.210
Let's wait to see what Fred finds
before chasing it.

18:12.650 --> 18:17.039
If we wait, it could find a way into
the world. I won't let that happen.

18:18.049 --> 18:19.799
Let's go.

18:26.450 --> 18:28.700
- I don't wanna hear it.
- I didn't say anything.

18:28.849 --> 18:30.390
Let's keep it that way.

18:31.849 --> 18:33.039
Well, was I wrong?

18:33.049 --> 18:35.750
It's my mess.
I'm cleaning it up. What more--?

18:36.650 --> 18:40.059
- You mess with Powers of Darkness--
- There's a price to pay.

18:40.250 --> 18:42.319
I know. There's always a price.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.970
The question is:
Is it one worth paying?

18:45.049 --> 18:47.750
So was this?

18:48.650 --> 18:53.039
That spell I did was for nothing. I
didn't find my son. He's gone forever.

18:53.450 --> 18:57.490
Was it worth it? Would I do it again?
In a heartbeat because he was my son.

19:46.250 --> 19:47.690
Angel, what are you--?

19:49.849 --> 19:52.099
Well, go team!

19:55.849 --> 19:57.740
Now that wasn't so--

19:58.250 --> 20:00.500
God, I hate this.

20:00.650 --> 20:03.769
I'm with you.
That creepy crawler was messed up.

20:04.849 --> 20:07.799
With those little feelers
sticking out of its face...

20:07.849 --> 20:09.599
...slithering like a worm
with its slimy--

20:10.250 --> 20:13.269
No. I meant I hate going
through these books.

20:14.450 --> 20:16.869
Yeah, books. That's rough.

20:17.450 --> 20:20.430
Everything on thaumogenesis is
so cryptic...

20:21.049 --> 20:24.240
...and full of words I've never
heard of like "amulatives."

20:24.650 --> 20:28.829
I have to keep cross-referencing
"Chaldean" with "Accadian Magics."

20:30.650 --> 20:34.720
- Are you listening to me?
- Yeah. Accordion music. Go on.

20:35.450 --> 20:38.119
Ask me to research
wave-particle dualities...

20:38.450 --> 20:42.309
...or the Schrödinger Equation,
and I'm a hellcat. But this?

20:43.849 --> 20:48.519
Angel will just have to realize that
I'm not as qualified for this as...

20:50.450 --> 20:51.640
...some people.

20:52.250 --> 20:56.319
Some people aren't around anymore,
so you'll have to get good at it.

20:57.049 --> 21:00.170
What if I fail?
What if I can't find anything to help?

21:00.650 --> 21:03.910
We'll manage. Not that I don't
prefer something I can punch...

21:04.849 --> 21:08.150
...that doesn't make that squishy
noise when you kill it.

21:08.450 --> 21:11.259
But we can handle
one little slug from hell.

22:06.009 --> 22:08.430
"Bio-plasmic infection"?

22:10.210 --> 22:12.769
- Speaking of.
- You get the e-mail?

22:13.210 --> 22:17.039
The confidential one? The one
I have to use a magic bug to open?

22:18.009 --> 22:20.849
The one that you shouldn't
even know about?

22:21.609 --> 22:23.779
Must've been a glitch in the server.

22:24.009 --> 22:29.069
So psychics say it looks like Angel's
hotel has some uninvited guests.

22:30.009 --> 22:32.180
Interesting. Why do I care again?

22:32.410 --> 22:34.869
One word: thaumogenesis.

22:37.210 --> 22:39.839
- The spell.
- The one you helped him perform.

22:40.210 --> 22:43.539
Everything has repercussions.
Angel knew that going in.

22:44.410 --> 22:48.339
I'm glad you see it that way.
Repercussions. Poetic justice.

22:48.609 --> 22:51.980
You have a point, or are you waxing
my desk with your ass?

22:52.809 --> 22:54.630
Whatever these things are...

22:55.210 --> 22:58.759
...they're not too cuddly since
Angel barricaded himself inside...

22:59.410 --> 23:01.230
...to prevent unleashing them
to the populace.

23:01.210 --> 23:04.299
So yay. Let him reap what he's sown.

23:05.410 --> 23:07.970
Maybe I'll get lucky
and they'll rip him to....

23:11.410 --> 23:14.460
Think the senior partners
might be upset if he died...

23:15.009 --> 23:17.609
...as a result of a spell
you helped him cast?

23:18.609 --> 23:22.680
- You gotta be kidding me.
- With Linwood on vacation, unreachable.

23:23.410 --> 23:25.619
This is a dilemma.

23:26.410 --> 23:27.670
Well, bye.

23:28.210 --> 23:32.710
Wait. So, what, I'm supposed
to go in there and save Angel?

23:33.009 --> 23:36.559
I'm sorry. I don't know
what you're talking about.

23:38.569 --> 23:40.460
Poor Angel. It's eating at him.

23:40.970 --> 23:43.289
- You have another vision?
- What? No.

23:43.970 --> 23:47.089
Knowing it was the spell
he performed to find Connor...

23:47.569 --> 23:51.190
...that made this thing we're hunting,
that it caused a death.

23:51.769 --> 23:53.309
- He's your priority.
- What?

23:53.569 --> 23:58.769
You said earlier. Angel,
his feelings were your only concern.

24:00.170 --> 24:01.359
He was all that matters.

24:01.369 --> 24:06.710
Oh, no, Grooey,
I meant work priority. Work.

24:07.970 --> 24:12.569
You see, you're
my other stuff priority.

24:13.369 --> 24:15.299
You get that, right?

24:18.769 --> 24:20.140
Groo, honey.

24:21.769 --> 24:24.190
- We can talk about this.
- Do not move.

24:28.369 --> 24:31.700
- Get it! It's going down.
- I instructed you not to move.

24:32.569 --> 24:36.750
- Forgive me for saving my own life.
- I wouldn't have let it harm you.

24:37.970 --> 24:39.369
- We saw it!
- You saw it?

24:39.769 --> 24:41.349
- There's more?
- Two at least.

24:41.569 --> 24:43.890
- We should assume there's more.
- Must we?

24:44.569 --> 24:47.589
- At least we have one advantage.
- They glow in the dark?

24:48.170 --> 24:50.559
That won't help
unless we shut the lights--

24:50.569 --> 24:52.990
- You're not serious.
- They're hard to kill.

24:53.569 --> 24:57.119
I speared one. It was strong enough
to attack us and escape.

24:57.769 --> 25:00.119
If it makes them easier to find,
we do it.

25:00.769 --> 25:03.019
- All the lights?
- Here.

25:03.769 --> 25:07.390
Take this. Lock yourself in the office.
We still need answers.

25:07.970 --> 25:10.250
- Right.
- This gets funner and funner.

25:10.369 --> 25:12.089
Glad you're enjoying yourself...

25:12.769 --> 25:15.400
...because somebody has to go to
the basement and shut off the power.

25:15.769 --> 25:16.930
No, no, no, no, no, no. No.

25:22.970 --> 25:24.019
Rat.

25:27.170 --> 25:28.539
Rat.

25:29.569 --> 25:30.829
Everything okay down there?

25:31.369 --> 25:35.369
It's a party.
Here's the icing on the cake.

26:19.049 --> 26:20.730
- Where are we?
- South wing.

26:20.849 --> 26:24.220
Haven't found a use for it yet,
so we keep it closed up.

26:25.049 --> 26:27.680
- Do you hear something?
- Sorry, all I hear...

26:28.049 --> 26:31.069
...is the erratic thumping
of the heart in my mouth.

26:31.650 --> 26:35.619
It sounds like....
It almost sounds like....

26:36.450 --> 26:37.779
Birds.

26:44.250 --> 26:46.740
Do we even have a key for this?

26:51.450 --> 26:52.990
Fred, it's me. Open up.

26:57.450 --> 26:59.660
Sorry it took so long to get back.

27:00.450 --> 27:03.680
I looked around to make sure
no slimeys were lurking.

27:04.049 --> 27:05.420
We're good.

27:07.650 --> 27:11.299
- How you holding up? You okay?
- Scared.

27:12.450 --> 27:13.529
Very scared.

27:13.650 --> 27:17.410
I know. It's gonna be okay, all right?

27:18.450 --> 27:22.559
We just have to keep it together.
Watch each other's backs.

27:25.650 --> 27:28.210
When this is over,
I think you and me...

27:28.650 --> 27:32.059
...should go away someplace,
like Cordy and Groo got to do.

27:32.849 --> 27:36.500
Maybe Baja. A little sun, sand.
I think we deserve it.

27:37.049 --> 27:39.190
You have to get out of here.

27:39.450 --> 27:41.910
That's what I'm saying. And we will.

27:42.450 --> 27:45.779
Soon as we kill these creatures,
I'll talk to Angel. Maybe he'll--

27:48.450 --> 27:50.589
Fred?

27:53.250 --> 27:54.480
Oh, no.

27:58.049 --> 27:59.630
We're thirsty.

28:04.049 --> 28:08.190
- Where does that come from?
- Somewhere in this room.

28:08.849 --> 28:11.900
Man, this place is one part hum,
two parts dinger.

28:12.450 --> 28:15.049
Ever think of turning it
into a nightclub?

28:15.450 --> 28:17.170
Missing the life. Sue me.

28:17.849 --> 28:20.759
- Gunn!
- We have a serious problem.

28:21.450 --> 28:25.660
- Oh, no, Fred.
- We gotta get her help, fast.

28:27.450 --> 28:29.549
- Can you hear me?
- It's in her brain.

28:29.849 --> 28:31.220
You can't reach her.

28:32.250 --> 28:33.299
Angel?

28:34.650 --> 28:35.630
Fred.

28:35.849 --> 28:38.690
I feel it. Its needs.

28:39.450 --> 28:42.259
Its thirst. Oh, God, I'm so thirsty.

28:43.049 --> 28:47.829
- Hang on, we'll get you to a hospital.
- No, Charles, we-- No.

28:49.049 --> 28:51.079
It wants that.

28:52.650 --> 28:56.410
To escape. Spread.
You can't let it.

28:58.650 --> 29:00.019
Let us--

29:01.049 --> 29:03.819
It will kill.

29:07.650 --> 29:10.039
It really doesn't like you.

29:10.650 --> 29:12.509
- Feeling's mutual.
- That's it.

29:13.049 --> 29:14.380
- What are you doing?
- Leaving.

29:14.849 --> 29:16.359
- But she said--
- I don't care.

29:16.650 --> 29:19.809
- The thing inside her may be in charge.
- Don't do this.

29:20.250 --> 29:21.720
- Get out of my way.
- Think.

29:22.049 --> 29:24.750
How will she feel
if she causes more deaths?

29:25.049 --> 29:27.470
- She? Or you?
- Me?

29:28.049 --> 29:30.650
All this is happening because of you.
It's your fault.

29:31.049 --> 29:34.349
- Messing with scary-ass mojo.
- I did what I had to do.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.640
To get what you want.
The hell with us.

29:38.250 --> 29:40.500
- My son--
- Is dead. Fred's not.

29:40.650 --> 29:44.900
- We have to stick together.
- Yeah? Where does it say that?

29:46.049 --> 29:49.529
Here. The sounds.
They come from under.

30:12.450 --> 30:14.059
Oh, my God.

30:14.849 --> 30:16.109
We have a pool?

30:19.049 --> 30:20.980
Run! Move!

30:38.250 --> 30:40.000
They're all over!

30:42.450 --> 30:46.349
No more running. Too hot. Too hot.

30:47.849 --> 30:48.900
Turn on the ovens!

30:49.049 --> 30:50.839
- We gonna cook them?
- Cook the air.

30:51.450 --> 30:53.549
Dry it out. Make it uncomfortable
so they won't want in.

30:55.049 --> 30:59.509
- That's what I call uncomfortable.
- Charles! Where's Charles?

31:00.450 --> 31:02.589
- What?
- He's gone!

31:03.769 --> 31:06.650
Meet with the shaman exterminator
in 15. The S.W.A.T. team in place?

31:07.970 --> 31:10.220
Good. The cleanup crew will join you.

31:10.970 --> 31:14.660
Now I want everybody waiting
for my go. I'm heading out now.

31:15.170 --> 31:18.079
- What's the activity?
- Cleaning out Angel's hotel.

31:18.769 --> 31:21.089
I wanna stop this
before Linwood finds out.

31:21.769 --> 31:24.890
A little late, but okay. Have fun.

31:25.369 --> 31:28.039
- What did you say?
- "Have fun"?

31:30.170 --> 31:31.779
Get out.

31:33.769 --> 31:36.259
- You said Linwood was unreachable.
- He is.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.319
Except for the emergency cell number.
He did give it to you, right?

31:40.970 --> 31:44.089
Fine, play your little games.
I've gotta save my immortal enemy.

31:46.369 --> 31:47.559
What? What--?

31:47.569 --> 31:51.819
I don't question your loyalty, but
you sure that's what Linwood wants?

31:52.970 --> 31:55.039
Angel kidnapped and tortured him.

31:55.369 --> 31:59.269
Linwood may have unresolved feelings
since he was nearly blinded.

31:59.569 --> 32:02.130
What did he say, Gavin?

32:03.170 --> 32:06.609
"Let them die. Let them all die."

32:07.970 --> 32:10.319
Maybe the old man has guts after all.

32:10.369 --> 32:13.180
There was the part about
overstepping your bounds...

32:13.970 --> 32:17.410
...and paying for the unauthorized
ops out of your salary.

32:18.170 --> 32:20.380
Of course, how he can't
trust you anymore and--

32:20.569 --> 32:23.980
Right, that he'd deal
with you when he got back.

32:24.769 --> 32:28.700
I don't know what he meant by that.
But I'm not ahead of the game.

32:34.369 --> 32:36.119
Need your help.

32:45.049 --> 32:47.470
There are too many
to fight our way out.

32:47.450 --> 32:48.640
I know.

32:54.049 --> 32:56.440
We need water!

32:57.049 --> 32:58.380
- Angel!
- Whoa, easy.

32:58.849 --> 33:01.450
I wanna talk to that thing inside you.
What are you?

33:01.849 --> 33:03.250
We....

33:06.650 --> 33:08.579
We're thirsty.

33:09.049 --> 33:13.049
Work with me, Fred. Make it answer me.
What do you want here?

33:15.049 --> 33:16.130
To live.

33:18.049 --> 33:19.769
To live.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.819
To drink.

33:25.849 --> 33:27.920
And be merry.

33:28.849 --> 33:31.099
It hurts us.

33:33.049 --> 33:34.349
We have to get out.

33:36.650 --> 33:39.670
- Sounds more like they want in.
- Have to flee.

33:42.049 --> 33:43.910
It brings pain.

33:44.450 --> 33:46.869
- Such pain.
- "It"? What happened to "we"?

33:47.450 --> 33:50.859
- Why the pronoun switcheroo?
- What are you fleeing from?

33:51.650 --> 33:53.970
The bringer of torment.

33:54.049 --> 33:56.720
Agony. Death.

33:59.450 --> 34:01.980
- The Destroyer.
- Oh.

34:03.049 --> 34:06.349
That is just not the name
you wanna hear.

34:06.650 --> 34:10.619
- Why is this Destroyer after you?
- It's not.

34:12.650 --> 34:15.139
It's coming after you...

34:16.250 --> 34:17.860
...Angel.

34:24.849 --> 34:28.920
I don't have time to get into it
with you. I don't wanna be here.

34:29.650 --> 34:32.250
The hotel's infested
with some slug thing.

34:32.650 --> 34:35.840
We don't know what they are
or how to kill them.

34:36.849 --> 34:38.639
Well, now, that is a problem.

34:38.650 --> 34:41.139
There's hundreds of them.
They enter you...

34:42.250 --> 34:45.730
...and soak up the moisture
out of you. They drink you alive.

34:46.449 --> 34:49.679
Why come to me? Angel will
figure out a way to kill them.

34:50.050 --> 34:52.010
That's not what I'm looking for.

34:52.449 --> 34:56.659
I need to know how to get these slugs
out of someone who's infected.

34:57.849 --> 34:59.880
- Sorry.
- Don't give me that.

35:01.449 --> 35:04.010
- If you could see what they do....
- I wish I could help.

35:04.449 --> 35:06.340
- Wes--
- Sorry you wasted your time.

35:06.849 --> 35:07.969
It's Fred.

35:27.849 --> 35:30.900
We're having a drink?
Did you hear me? She's dying.

35:31.449 --> 35:34.400
I was dying. Throat cut,
life pouring out of me.

35:35.050 --> 35:37.510
- Know why I fought to live?
- I don't have time.

35:38.050 --> 35:41.070
I wanted to live
to see my friends again.

35:41.650 --> 35:46.670
To explain to the people I loved
and trusted my side of what happened.

35:48.250 --> 35:50.570
- We know what--
- You don't know anything.

35:52.449 --> 35:57.750
I'll help because it's Fred.
But don't come here again. Any of you.

35:59.050 --> 36:00.309
No. I need more.

36:00.849 --> 36:03.590
I need more.
Tell me where you come from.

36:07.449 --> 36:11.449
- Fred!
- You're gonna die so horribly.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.460
Oh, God, help me.

36:20.650 --> 36:23.489
Lorne, take her.
Shut off the ovens and stoves.

36:24.250 --> 36:25.369
- Why?
- Hurry!

36:25.449 --> 36:27.909
You guys get Fred to the hospital.

36:28.449 --> 36:31.429
We talked about that.
Infecting the world and all.

36:32.050 --> 36:35.630
They can keep her hydrated
until you come up with a cure.

36:36.250 --> 36:40.110
- We're surrounded. How do we get past?
- I'll keep them occupied.

36:41.050 --> 36:43.329
- How?
- By giving them what they want.

36:44.650 --> 36:46.610
Damsel in distress.
You know what to do.

36:47.050 --> 36:49.539
- Angel.
- Take Fred. Please!

36:57.250 --> 36:58.550
Now!

37:09.849 --> 37:12.340
Cordy, I told you to get out of here.

37:23.650 --> 37:25.260
- Put my girl down.
- Where--?

37:25.449 --> 37:28.010
News updates later. Just lay her down.

37:29.650 --> 37:33.019
- She requires a healer.
- She requires this. Hold her.

37:33.849 --> 37:34.860
Do it!

37:36.250 --> 37:40.920
Come here, baby, come here, come here.
Drink, drink, drink, drink.

37:48.250 --> 37:50.670
Angel! Incoming, four o'clock!

37:55.449 --> 37:56.639
Angel.

38:00.250 --> 38:02.670
Come on, baby, drink.

38:24.250 --> 38:25.860
Angel, what's...

38:26.650 --> 38:28.119
...happening to...

38:33.250 --> 38:34.409
...me?

38:50.610 --> 38:54.090
Unless anyone else has something,
I'll be the first to say:

38:54.809 --> 38:58.780
- What the hell was that?
- Cordelia. That was Cordelia.

38:59.610 --> 39:02.909
- You are truly a goddess.
- Well, demoness, anyway.

39:03.809 --> 39:08.380
- Beats horns and a tail.
- Hey, I'm standing right here.

39:12.210 --> 39:13.650
She okay?

39:14.610 --> 39:17.519
Yeah. I got this idea.

39:17.610 --> 39:21.019
Alcohol. Dehydrates the body,
gets the slug out.

39:23.010 --> 39:26.340
So I left when those things
came out of the floor.

39:27.210 --> 39:29.769
It's not like I was
running out on you.

39:30.210 --> 39:32.460
Look, someone I care about was dying.

39:32.610 --> 39:35.280
I couldn't sit around
and debate strategy.

39:36.210 --> 39:38.489
I saw an opportunity
to get some help.

39:38.610 --> 39:41.730
I did what I had to do,
and if you don't get that--

39:43.409 --> 39:45.369
Yeah, I guess you do.

39:45.809 --> 39:47.559
So we're good?

39:48.809 --> 39:53.550
Good? We're not good. Did you forget
we have unexpected company on the way?

39:54.210 --> 39:56.769
It goes by the initials
of "the Destroyer."

39:57.210 --> 40:00.159
The Destroyer.
I remember the Destroyer's coming.

40:00.809 --> 40:03.579
Yeah, we got that. Any idea when?

40:04.409 --> 40:06.800
I think.... Now.

40:32.010 --> 40:33.239
Hi, Dad.
