I must don
the ceremonial garb.

00:24.192 --> 00:27.261
Tonight, darkness shall
creep over the land,

00:27.295 --> 00:28.829
terror will walk the streets,

00:28.862 --> 00:31.065
and children
will shriek in fear,

00:31.099 --> 00:34.602
for tonight we will face
our greatest demons.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.105
Happy Halloween!

00:40.641 --> 00:42.576
Yay, you're a purple bunny.
Cool.

00:42.610 --> 00:44.312
I'm a Pretty Pegasus.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.680
Come on, guys. Halloween!

RAVEN: Look, a scary ghost.

00:55.189 --> 00:57.425
Your paper ghost
is well made, Raven,

00:57.458 --> 00:59.427
but far from the frightening.

01:03.431 --> 01:04.432
Boo!

01:04.465 --> 01:06.467
What a waste of good produce.

01:07.368 --> 01:09.637
Who wants candy?

01:09.670 --> 01:11.639
We can get bags of it tonight.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.841
If we want candy
we'll go buy some.

01:13.874 --> 01:17.411
Beast Boy, I know for a fact
you love costumes.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.547
We wear costumes
every day, mama.

01:19.580 --> 01:22.683
What's going on, guys?
Halloween is our
favorite holiday.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.718
It was our favorite holiday.

01:24.752 --> 01:28.256
Now it's President's Day.

01:28.289 --> 01:30.458
Do you not remember
last year, Raven?

01:30.491 --> 01:33.494
Oh, why did we
eat all the candy?

01:33.527 --> 01:35.329
-I don't feel so good.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.331
-Me too, bro.

01:37.365 --> 01:38.699
I think I'm gonna...

01:38.732 --> 01:40.701
-Thunder!
-Thunder!

01:40.734 --> 01:44.472
-Thunder cats!

01:44.505 --> 01:47.575
That's what happens
when you eat candy
with the wrapper still on.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.809
Why do you care
so much anyways?

01:48.842 --> 01:51.879
Because I'm half demon
and, you know,

01:51.912 --> 01:54.215
I like doing scary stuff
with you guys.

01:54.248 --> 01:57.318
We did too, Ray, but the
best part of Halloween
was being scared

01:57.351 --> 02:00.421
and now that we're older
it just isn't scary anymore.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.623
Yeah, I'm a grown man now,

02:02.656 --> 02:04.458
doin' grown man business.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.494
I don't have time
to be scurred.

02:08.462 --> 02:11.699
Halloween hasn't been scary
since I was a little gillnart.

02:11.732 --> 02:15.269
What are you talking about?
It's totally still scary.

02:17.538 --> 02:19.207
Yep, not scary,
trying to watch.

02:19.240 --> 02:21.842
-Oh, you guys are so lame.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.613
So Halloween
isn't scary anymore.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.249
I've got just the thing
for that.

02:29.049 --> 02:30.651
-A witch's eye...

02:30.684 --> 02:32.553
...a dragon scale,

02:32.586 --> 02:33.821
a mummy's hand,

02:34.422 --> 02:35.689
a goblin's tail,

02:36.490 --> 02:38.426
and three candy corn.

02:38.459 --> 02:39.660
-Mmm.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.195
Two candy corn.

02:44.298 --> 02:45.699
-Ah!

02:51.705 --> 02:55.476
Who summons my might
on this old Hallows night?

02:55.509 --> 02:59.213
Oh, great Halloween spirit,

02:59.247 --> 03:00.113
I totally need a solid.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.749
My friends aren't
into Halloween anymore.

03:01.782 --> 03:04.952
Not into Halloween?
Whatever do you mean?

03:04.985 --> 03:08.356
Well, they say it's not
scary anymore because
they're too old.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.690
Too old they say?

03:09.723 --> 03:12.560
Well now they'll pay,
for my boos and ghosts,

03:12.593 --> 03:17.431
we'll plot and scheme
to make your friends
all run and scream.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.847
Why are we suddenly
scared of everything?

03:40.588 --> 03:42.523
Ahh, we're kids again!

03:42.556 --> 03:45.559
Whoa, you made them kids?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.261
You did say they were too old.

03:47.295 --> 03:48.596
That's not what I meant.

03:48.629 --> 03:51.699
Whoa, Rave,
why are you so big?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.401
Why are we so little?

03:53.434 --> 03:54.735
And why am I so adorable?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.670
I pee-pee'd myself.

03:58.806 --> 04:00.908
What was that?

04:03.511 --> 04:04.778
Monsters!

04:04.812 --> 04:06.580
Don't let 'em in,
don't let 'em in.

04:06.614 --> 04:08.516
Code Red, I repeat Code Red!

04:08.549 --> 04:10.751
-Go into lockdown,
now, now, now!

04:12.052 --> 04:14.322
Guys, they're just
trick-or-treaters.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.796
Phew!

04:22.830 --> 04:24.765
-Yeah.

04:24.798 --> 04:26.600
That was a close one.

04:26.634 --> 04:27.935
-Boo!
-Ahhh!

04:29.803 --> 04:31.939
No!

04:32.940 --> 04:33.941
Ahh!

04:39.880 --> 04:42.616
Oh, it feels so good
to be out.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.986
Time to make
some kiddies shout!

04:56.564 --> 04:57.665
Who was that?

04:57.698 --> 04:58.932
And why am I so adorable?

04:58.966 --> 05:00.834
Uh, that was
the Halloween Spirit

05:00.868 --> 05:03.837
who I guess you made mad
by saying you were
too old for Halloween,

05:03.871 --> 05:06.440
so he turned you
into little kids or something.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.343

05:09.377 --> 05:11.011

05:14.081 --> 05:16.450

terrorized the land,

05:16.484 --> 05:17.985
"bringing nightmares to life,

05:18.018 --> 05:20.554
"feeding on the fear
of all children.

grew stronger,
so did his power.

"From their victory
our Halloween traditions
were born."

05:34.868 --> 05:38.772
We can banish him again,
but we need to do it
before the full moon sets,

05:38.806 --> 05:40.574
or you'll be trapped
as kids forever.

05:42.876 --> 05:44.344
What do we do?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.313
We fight.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.115
In order to return
the Halloween Spirit
to his realm,

05:48.148 --> 05:50.050
we're gonna need
a few things.

('80s-STYLED
POP MUSIC PLAYING)

06:23.917 --> 06:25.419
What were we thinking?

06:25.453 --> 06:28.489
My quirltrap has never
quivered so violently.

06:28.522 --> 06:29.923
Guys, I know it's scary,

06:29.957 --> 06:31.725
but this is what
Halloween's all about.

06:31.759 --> 06:34.628
Braving your worst fears
for the one thing
we need most.

06:34.662 --> 06:35.829
What's that?

06:35.863 --> 06:37.765
Candy and lots of it.

06:37.798 --> 06:40.768
Candy?
Lead the way, purple bear.

06:40.801 --> 06:43.036
I'm a Pretty Pegasus.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.439
Now, let's trick-or-treat!

07:13.033 --> 07:15.936
Uh, Rave?

07:15.969 --> 07:18.972
Now that you kids
have had your fun,

07:19.006 --> 07:21.542
it's time to make you
scream and run.

07:42.095 --> 07:43.697
It is not working.

07:43.731 --> 07:45.265
Must be because we're afraid.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.701
As long as he's feeding
off our fear,
we can't beat him.

07:47.735 --> 07:48.869
What do we do?

07:51.171 --> 07:52.205
Run!

08:08.188 --> 08:09.623
-Ahhh!

08:33.313 --> 08:35.148
I'm sorry, guys,
it's all my fault.

08:35.182 --> 08:37.851
I summoned
the Halloween Spirit.

08:37.885 --> 08:39.853
Why did you do that?

08:39.887 --> 08:43.023
Because Halloween was
the one day of the year
we all looked forward to.

08:43.056 --> 08:45.693
Carving pumpkins,
trick-or-treating,
haunted houses,

08:45.726 --> 08:47.861
I was just trying
to get all that back.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.863
Instead I ruined Halloween.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.565
Are you kidding, Raven?

08:51.599 --> 08:52.900
Even though I've had
to change my pants
three times,

08:52.933 --> 08:54.735
this has been the best
Halloween ever!

08:54.768 --> 08:57.971
I hope my quirltrap
never stops quivering.

08:58.005 --> 09:00.941
Yeah, being scared
is so much fun!

09:00.974 --> 09:03.043
It's like being an adorable
little kid again.

09:03.076 --> 09:08.281
Really? Then let's power up
with some Halloween candy
and take these guys down!

09:33.707 --> 09:35.008
Halloween Spirit,

09:35.042 --> 09:38.345
I command you to restore
my friends and return
to your realm.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.850
Don't make me laugh,
purple giraffe.

09:42.883 --> 09:44.818
I'm a Pretty Pegasus.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.387
And the name is Sparkle Face.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.389
Jack-o'-lanterns.

09:50.858 --> 09:52.025
Light 'em up.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.871
Keep it up, guys.

10:18.018 --> 10:19.219
We did it.

10:19.252 --> 10:21.088
-Best Halloween ever!

10:21.121 --> 10:23.023
-Whoo! Whoo!
-Let's do it again next year!

10:24.324 --> 10:26.694
Thanks for spending
Halloween with me, guys.

10:26.727 --> 10:29.362
And thanks for reminding us
how fun Halloween can be.

10:29.396 --> 10:31.732
There's just one last thing.

10:31.765 --> 10:32.766
What?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.735
-Boo!

10:45.178 --> 10:47.014
I love Halloween.
