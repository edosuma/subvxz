JOSEPH CASWELL.

05:32.916 --> 05:37.831
HE TELLS ME HE VVAS A TRAIL BOSS ON A
CATTLE RANCH IN THE TERRITORY OF MONTANA.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.918
HIS LAST MOMENT
OF RECOLLECTION

05:42.008 --> 05:46.844
WAS NOVEMBER 14, 1880.

ONLY IN THE LAST FEVV MOMENTS DID HE SEEM
TO HAVE ANY GRASP OF VVHAT HAS OCCURRED.

06:32.684 --> 06:36.268
THERE'S ONE
DISTURBING POINT.

06:36.354 --> 06:40.564
THERE ARE THE MARKS OF A ROPE
ETCHED DEEPLY INTO HIS NECK.

06:40.650 --> 06:43.984
HE HAS NO
EXPLANATION FOR THIS.

06:44.070 --> 06:47.734
AND I HAVE ONE OTHER
OBSERVATION HARDLY SCIENTIFIC.

06:49.492 --> 06:51.654
I DON'T LIKE HIS LOOKS.

06:51.745 --> 06:56.239
I DON'T LIKE THE EYES OR THE

I GET A FEELING THAT I'VE TAKEN
A 19TH CENTURY PRIMITIVE

07:04.257 --> 07:08.876

A 20TH CENTURY JUNGLE.

07:11.139 --> 07:15.508

THINGS THAT YOU'VE
NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

09:14.888 --> 09:17.971

AND WHAT ABOUT
JUSTICE, CASWELL?

09:37.410 --> 09:39.947
WHAT ABOUT JUSTICE?

09:41.915 --> 09:46.000
AM I SUPPOSED TO
KNOW ABOUT JUSTICE?

09:46.086 --> 09:48.748
MORE THAN MOST

RIGHT AND VVRONG, THEY CAN
TRY TO BEAT INTO YOU.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.428
