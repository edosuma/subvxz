- Can I help you with something?
- ASA Anna Valdez.

00:07.580 --> 00:09.290
You have a prisoner...
Adrian Carrera.

00:09.450 --> 00:10.460
- That we do.

00:10.480 --> 00:12.530
- Uh, his defense attorney
should be with him.

00:12.550 --> 00:14.500
- That he is.
Arnold Rifking...

00:14.520 --> 00:15.740
Total bottom feeder.

00:15.760 --> 00:17.440
Hey, Duarte,

escort ASA Valdez upstairs
to the drunk tank.

00:20.430 --> 00:22.380
Uh, Mr. Carrera was
pretty loaded

00:22.400 --> 00:24.440
when they hauled him in
this morning.

00:24.460 --> 00:26.370
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

00:30.770 --> 00:33.520
- Good news, bad news, Arnold.
Which do you want first?

00:33.540 --> 00:35.520
- How bad's the bad?
- Very.

00:35.540 --> 00:38.660
- I'll take good for $500,
please, Alex.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.430
- Stone authorized a plea of 20

00:40.450 --> 00:41.900
for Carrera today only.
Take it or leave it.

00:41.920 --> 00:43.900
- On a simple assault?
We'll pass.

00:43.920 --> 00:45.600
- Brings us to the bad.

00:45.620 --> 00:47.400
Mr. Carrera's victim
in the barroom brawl

00:47.420 --> 00:48.600

- I barely touched that guy.

00:51.660 --> 00:53.470
- Shut up, Adrian.
Let me talk to my client.

00:53.490 --> 00:55.640
- Nothing to talk about.
And I need to get out of here.

00:55.660 --> 00:57.140

01:42.940 --> 01:44.620
- Sorry, Arnold,
you're too late.

01:44.640 --> 01:47.890

Kid in the cell... he died.

01:47.910 --> 01:49.000

of natural causes.

02:12.970 --> 02:14.990
- He was in police custody.

02:15.010 --> 02:18.060
Next thing we know,
he sustained fatal injuries.

He bled to death.

No pulse.
Pupils were fixed and dilated.

You went to the lake with
Wilkes still in the ambulance?

I-I pinched him.

07:43.040 --> 07:44.180

all over the place,

pretty good too.

08:11.200 --> 08:13.350

10:23.800 --> 10:26.040
because you did it the same away
a thousand times before.

10:30.370 --> 10:32.240
- Valdez?

10:34.740 --> 10:36.610
We'll meet you there.

10:47.620 --> 10:50.200
Mr. Carrera has something
he thinks might help

10:50.220 --> 10:52.370
with your search for
Mr. Wilkes's killer.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.340
- Right.
In exchange for what?

10:54.360 --> 10:55.210
- Hear him out,

10:55.230 --> 10:58.030
and then tell me
how you want to play it.

11:00.430 --> 11:02.450
- When I was in the cage
with Wilkes, he...

11:02.470 --> 11:05.280
He might've said something
about a cop hitting him.

11:05.300 --> 11:06.550
- Might have?

11:06.570 --> 11:08.250
- Depends.

11:08.270 --> 11:09.620
What do you got for me?

11:09.640 --> 11:12.230
- Wh... what my client means

11:12.250 --> 11:14.690
is that in exchange
for your empathy

11:14.710 --> 11:18.500
regarding a certain incident
in a local tavern,

11:18.520 --> 11:21.300
he'd be willing to testify
against the police officer

11:21.320 --> 11:23.470
who killed Mr. Wilkes.

11:23.490 --> 11:25.240
- Pass.

11:25.260 --> 11:26.310
- Like that?

11:26.330 --> 11:29.380
- One client swears a cop
killed your other client,

11:29.400 --> 11:30.540
he gets a slap on the wrist,

11:30.560 --> 11:33.580
and you get a seven-figure
civil verdict against the city.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.410
Look at it this way, Arnold.

11:35.430 --> 11:38.380
I am protecting you
from a feeble attempt

11:38.400 --> 11:40.010
to suborn perjury.

11:48.280 --> 11:50.530
- I do this, we both end up
in orange pajamas.

11:50.550 --> 11:51.660
- Alongside Atwater.

11:51.680 --> 11:53.800
- Tell me again why you can't go
through proper channels.

11:53.820 --> 11:56.370
- An official request
gets the blue wagons circling,

11:56.390 --> 11:58.370
and all of a sudden,
the videos are magically drawn

11:58.390 --> 11:59.640
into a big black hole.

11:59.660 --> 12:00.840
- Sound like you're not gonna
like what we find.

12:00.860 --> 12:02.810
- I don't know
what the hell we'll find.

12:02.830 --> 12:04.480
But I do know
I gotta get ahead of it

12:04.500 --> 12:06.380
before the big guys
throw Atwater to the wolves

12:06.400 --> 12:08.580
just to keep the peace.

12:08.600 --> 12:11.350

12:13.840 --> 12:16.820
Hey, it's between you and me.
I swear.

12:18.580 --> 12:20.050
Give me a couple hours.

12:23.580 --> 12:26.430
- My heart goes out to you,
Mrs. Wilkes.

12:26.450 --> 12:28.530
The loss of a child...

12:28.550 --> 12:30.570
I can't even imagine it.

12:30.590 --> 12:32.470
- Thank you, sir.

12:32.490 --> 12:34.870
- How can I help you?

12:34.890 --> 12:37.410
- Actually...

12:37.430 --> 12:40.410
we're here to help you, Mark.

12:40.430 --> 12:42.120
I have what some might call

12:42.140 --> 12:46.490
a unique relationship
with the community.

12:46.510 --> 12:48.650
- No one appreciates that
more than I.

12:48.670 --> 12:50.660
- In that capacity,

of reasonable doubt

18:21.940 --> 18:22.990
for any and all of them.

18:23.010 --> 18:24.820
- The problem is,
we don't have enough evidence

18:24.840 --> 18:26.730
to convict any one of them
alone.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.730
- No, Anna,
the problem is saying,

18:28.750 --> 18:30.230
"Sorry,
someone screwed the pooch,

18:30.250 --> 18:32.930
but we don't know who."

justify anything to you,

18:35.020 --> 18:37.840
but the man has a voice
that people listen to.

18:37.860 --> 18:40.070

everyone involved.

18:46.870 --> 18:47.980

18:48.000 --> 18:50.180
the EMTs who took their time
getting him to the hospital,

bleed to death

18:51.940 --> 18:52.850

- Why not?

18:56.070 --> 18:58.720
Once in custody, Justin Wilkes
became a ward of the State,

18:58.740 --> 19:01.060
and deserved all the protection
the State has to offer.

19:01.080 --> 19:03.730
But to the cop,
the EMTs, the... the doctors,

19:03.750 --> 19:07.730
he was just a subhuman
whose life wasn't worth saving.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.700
- And to you, what is he?

19:09.720 --> 19:11.760
- He's a murder victim.

19:23.140 --> 19:25.180
- To establish conspiracy,
you have to prove

19:25.200 --> 19:27.820
they all agreed to kill Wilkes.

19:27.840 --> 19:29.720
- That's why I never said
anything about a conspiracy.

19:29.740 --> 19:31.590
I'm gonna argue that
their collective actions,

19:31.610 --> 19:33.560
or inactions,
contributed to his death.

19:33.580 --> 19:36.630
But for each of them,
Wilkes would still be alive.

19:36.650 --> 19:38.760
Our country is coming apart
at the seams, Anna.

19:38.780 --> 19:40.770
The people have lost all
their faith in our institutions.

19:40.790 --> 19:42.700
The universities, the churches,
the government?

19:42.720 --> 19:44.540
Nobody trusts
any of them anymore.

19:44.560 --> 19:45.800
- And you're going to
change their minds?

19:45.820 --> 19:47.310
- No, but I'm gonna argue that

19:47.330 --> 19:49.210
our little corner of
the world is well

19:49.230 --> 19:50.210
and doing fine.

19:50.230 --> 19:54.280
A man dies, those responsible
will go to prison.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.820
- You are aware that
contributory negligence

19:56.840 --> 19:58.820
doesn't exist in
the criminal code?

19:58.840 --> 20:00.620
- If you always know
where you're going, Anna,

20:00.640 --> 20:01.820
you never get anywhere new.

20:01.840 --> 20:03.720

20:14.850 --> 20:15.970

20:15.990 --> 20:19.300

about that right arm.

20:19.320 --> 20:20.840
- I haven't touched
a baseball in years.

20:20.860 --> 20:22.740
What, uh...
what have you been up to?

20:22.760 --> 20:23.740
- Defense work.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.710
I got what you might call
a sub-specialty...

20:25.730 --> 20:27.680
Defending cops.

20:27.700 --> 20:29.720
- So this isn't
a happy coincidence?

20:29.740 --> 20:30.580
- Hm, afraid not.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.850
I've been retained by
Officer Atwater.

20:32.870 --> 20:35.320
Turns out my sub-specialty
has been in the news of late.

20:35.340 --> 20:37.360
I got a call from
Officer Atwater's C.O.,

20:37.380 --> 20:39.630
a Sergeant Voight,
and here I am.

20:39.650 --> 20:41.760
And so here we are.

20:41.780 --> 20:43.730
And since my mom taught me
a guest should never show up

20:43.750 --> 20:45.550
without a gift...

20:48.320 --> 20:50.340
- A motion to preclude
grand jury action.

20:50.360 --> 20:53.270
You're kidding, right?

20:53.290 --> 20:54.310
- I'm sorry, Paul,
I think you've got

20:54.330 --> 20:55.440
your jurisdictions confused.

20:55.460 --> 20:58.310
This might fly in Manhattan,
but it's DOA in Cook County.

20:58.330 --> 21:01.180
- Hm, and those who always know
where they're going...

21:01.200 --> 21:03.880
How about we let the presiding
judge make that call, huh?

21:03.900 --> 21:05.920
It really is good
to see you, Peter.

21:05.940 --> 21:07.950
- Yeah.

21:07.970 --> 21:09.610
- Ms. Valdez...

21:14.280 --> 21:16.190
Considering the paucity of
evidence against him,

21:16.210 --> 21:18.360
dragging my client in front of
the grand jury at this point

21:18.380 --> 21:19.900
would permanently scar
his reputation,

21:19.920 --> 21:21.330
and hinder his chance
for advancement

21:21.350 --> 21:22.330
in the Department.

21:22.350 --> 21:23.300
- Defendant's proper remedy

21:23.320 --> 21:24.970
is a motion to quash
the grand jury subpoena.

21:24.990 --> 21:26.670
- And ordinarily,
I would've made that motion,

21:26.690 --> 21:27.870
but the culture's
made it necessary

21:27.890 --> 21:29.780
to nip this in the bud
as soon as possible.

21:29.800 --> 21:31.780
- The culture?
- Specifically, the regard

21:31.800 --> 21:34.250
in which police officers
are held in society today.

21:34.270 --> 21:36.780
Is there really any question
what a grand jury will decide?

21:36.800 --> 21:38.950
- Like I said, I'm curious.

21:38.970 --> 21:40.650
Let me reread counsel's brief,

21:40.670 --> 21:42.220
and we'll pick this up
in, say, an hour.

21:42.240 --> 21:43.920
- Thank you, Your Honor.
- Oh, and Mr. Stone,

21:43.940 --> 21:46.190
could you please have
your office deliver a copy

21:46.210 --> 21:49.350
of all issued subpoenas
to my chambers ASAP?

21:51.820 --> 21:52.870
- You know, I have to admit,

21:52.890 --> 21:54.330
I thought she was gonna
toss you out on your butt.

21:54.350 --> 21:55.970
Thank you.

21:55.990 --> 21:58.900
She's probably just humoring me,
but it was worth a shot.

22:02.800 --> 22:04.680
Did you know that, uh,
Officer Atwater

22:04.700 --> 22:07.010
takes care of his sister
and two brothers?

22:07.030 --> 22:08.780
- Character evidence
isn't admissible

22:08.800 --> 22:10.250
until after a verdict.

22:10.270 --> 22:11.680
- Yeah, I know that.

22:11.700 --> 22:14.250
My question is why?

22:14.270 --> 22:15.890
- Because we're looking
into the truth

22:15.910 --> 22:17.690
about what happened to Wilkes.

22:17.710 --> 22:19.860
- You even sound like
your old man.

22:19.880 --> 22:22.700
When the acorn falls, it lands
in the shade of the oak.

22:22.720 --> 22:25.360
It could be stifling.

22:26.990 --> 22:30.000
No, my dad has nothing to do
with how I practice law.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.440
- Hm.

22:32.460 --> 22:35.370
A couple of years ago,
I called my dad out of the blue,

22:35.390 --> 22:37.480
just to say I'm sorry.

22:37.500 --> 22:39.010
- For what?

22:39.030 --> 22:40.780
- Mm, being his son,

22:40.800 --> 22:42.980
letting him down, whatever.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.740
You should try it.

22:49.340 --> 22:51.490
- No offense,
but you don't know...

22:51.510 --> 22:53.750
- Mm, I think I do.

23:01.890 --> 23:03.840
- I congratulate you on making

23:03.860 --> 23:06.870
a concise, reasoned argument,
Mr. Robinette.

23:06.890 --> 23:09.410
- Thank you, Judge.
- However, in Illinois,

23:09.430 --> 23:13.050
a grand jury has very broad
investigative powers.

23:13.070 --> 23:16.280
I understand your concern
about the negative impact

23:16.300 --> 23:19.950
the subpoenas might have
on the targets in this case,

23:19.970 --> 23:22.020
but that's the world we live in,

23:22.040 --> 23:24.810
and in that world,
I must deny your motion.

23:26.510 --> 23:28.050
- Thank you, Your Honor.

23:29.920 --> 23:33.770
- Targets, plural?

23:33.790 --> 23:35.370
Did he catch it?

23:35.390 --> 23:36.430
- Paul's a very good lawyer.

23:36.450 --> 23:39.070
- Is he good enough
to bring a frivolous motion

23:39.090 --> 23:42.130
just to trick a judge
into tipping our hand?

23:43.500 --> 23:45.810
Then he's got all
the reasonable doubt he needs.

23:45.830 --> 23:47.780
- Not under my theory
of the case, he doesn't.

23:49.940 --> 23:52.120
- The grand jury just returned
a single indictment

23:52.140 --> 23:55.890
against officer Kevin Atwater
for first-degree murder.

23:55.910 --> 23:57.120
- What about the others?

23:57.140 --> 24:00.160
Nothing.

24:00.180 --> 24:01.830
- So much for getting
somewhere new.

24:01.850 --> 24:04.100
- I want an arrest warrant
on Atwater,

24:04.120 --> 24:05.500
issued within the hour,

24:05.520 --> 24:07.800
and executed
immediately thereafter.

24:07.820 --> 24:10.000
- I'm sure Atwater
will surrender himself.

24:10.020 --> 24:12.070
- You just worry about
how you're gonna counter

24:12.090 --> 24:15.510
all the reasonable doubt
you just handed Mr. Robinette.

24:18.530 --> 24:25.770

24:34.510 --> 24:41.050
♪

24:42.120 --> 24:46.570
This action by
the grand jury today

24:46.590 --> 24:50.140
is a strong mandate
to this office

24:50.160 --> 24:56.150
to pursue the charges
against officer Kevin Atwater

24:56.170 --> 24:59.990
to the fullest extent
the law allows.

25:00.010 --> 25:02.490
And this is just an example

25:02.510 --> 25:05.420
of how the system works
on its own power,

25:05.440 --> 25:08.860
without the unnecessary
civil unrest

25:08.880 --> 25:11.430
we've seen in
too many other cities.

25:11.450 --> 25:13.470
Now it truly saddens me

25:13.490 --> 25:17.070
to bring the weight
of this office down

25:17.090 --> 25:21.070
upon a member
of law enforcement,

25:21.090 --> 25:25.040
but Mr. Wilkes and his family

25:25.060 --> 25:28.570
deserve nothing less.

25:35.540 --> 25:36.920
- You know,
when someone needs help,

25:36.940 --> 25:40.590
they dial 911.
Who shows up?

25:40.610 --> 25:43.230
- You really want to do this?
- I'll tell you what.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.130
It's not a lawyer.
We show up.

25:46.150 --> 25:48.170
And we don't know
what we're gonna find.

25:48.190 --> 25:50.000
Let's say Atwater
didn't tackle that punk.

25:50.020 --> 25:52.100
Let's say he approached him,
and said, "Excuse me, sir",

25:52.120 --> 25:54.540
"I saw you selling illegal
narcotics on a street corner.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.240
"Would you mind very much
coming to the station with me,

25:56.260 --> 25:58.610
so I can lock you up
for the next 30 years?"

25:58.630 --> 26:00.180
You know what happens then?

26:00.200 --> 26:02.180
That punk pulls a Glock 22
from his pants,

26:02.200 --> 26:03.180
and that's all she wrote
for Atwater.

26:03.200 --> 26:06.650

Worse than some, maybe...

26:19.150 --> 26:21.130

26:21.150 --> 26:22.570
And you tell me,
what kind of prick

26:22.590 --> 26:24.590
goes out of his way
to ruin a man like that?

26:33.730 --> 26:34.700
- Simply, the victim suffered
blunt force trauma

26:35.570 --> 26:38.580
to his rib cage,
causing it to splinter.

26:38.600 --> 26:40.350
A shard of bone
nicked the aorta,

26:40.370 --> 26:42.990
causing slow
but steady bleeding.

26:43.010 --> 26:44.640
- Could this have
caused the trauma?

26:46.210 --> 26:48.590
- Yes, if the victim had
landed on a rock

26:48.610 --> 26:49.660
or something like that.

26:49.680 --> 26:51.130
- Or this?

26:53.620 --> 26:56.700
- That's a lot bigger
than a rock... yes.

26:56.720 --> 26:58.220
- Thank you.

27:01.690 --> 27:03.680
- How long after
such a nick of the aorta

27:03.700 --> 27:06.010
would it take
for Mr. Wilkes to die?

27:06.030 --> 27:08.010
- Perhaps six or seven hours,
depending on how...

27:08.030 --> 27:10.250
- I show you what has been
marked as People's 3,

27:10.270 --> 27:13.090
Mr. Wilkes's
Certificate of Death.

27:13.110 --> 27:15.720
What time does it say he died?
- 4:06 p.m.

27:15.740 --> 27:18.590
- Huh, now,
according to the time stamp

27:18.610 --> 27:20.690
on the videos
Mr. Stone just showed you,

27:20.710 --> 27:23.100
Officer Atwater's last
so-called act of violence

27:23.120 --> 27:25.260
occurred at 7:10 a.m.

27:25.280 --> 27:27.030
According to your testimony,

27:27.050 --> 27:29.130
he should've been dead...
At the latest... 2:10.

27:29.150 --> 27:31.100
Isn't that correct?
- It's possible that...

27:31.120 --> 27:32.700
- Yes or no?

27:32.720 --> 27:35.040
- Sure.
- Right, so it's possible.

27:35.060 --> 27:37.340
No, it's scientifically probable
that neither of the events

27:37.360 --> 27:39.380
involving Officer Atwater
caused Mr. Wilkes's death.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.780
Isn't that correct,
Dr. Fletcher?

27:40.800 --> 27:43.650
- There's no way of...
- Yes or no, Doctor?

27:43.670 --> 27:44.780
- Yes.

27:44.800 --> 27:47.320
- I suppose that's why Mr. Stone
tried to indict the EMTs

27:47.340 --> 27:49.020
that brought Mr. Wilkes
to the hospital.

27:49.040 --> 27:50.160
- Objection.
- And the doctors who...

27:50.180 --> 27:51.720
- Objection.
- Does counsel deny

27:51.740 --> 27:53.190
they were all targets
of the grand jury?

27:53.210 --> 27:54.330
- Your Honor...
- Do I have to put you

27:54.350 --> 27:56.730
on the stand to verify?
- That's enough, Mr. Robinette.

27:56.750 --> 28:00.800
The jury will ignore
any mention of the grand jury.

28:00.820 --> 28:03.770
- No more questions.

28:03.790 --> 28:05.740
- Redirect, Your Honor?

28:05.760 --> 28:08.340
- Go ahead.

28:08.360 --> 28:10.210
- How precise
was your estimation

28:10.230 --> 28:11.310
of six or seven hours?

28:11.330 --> 28:13.610
- If defense counsel
had let me finish,

28:13.630 --> 28:15.350
I would have said that
the time needed

28:15.370 --> 28:17.750
for death by exsanguination
varies,

28:17.770 --> 28:21.150
according to the individual's
particular circulatory system.

28:21.170 --> 28:23.160
- So it could've taken
longer than seven hours

28:23.180 --> 28:26.090
for him to die?
- Yes.

28:26.110 --> 28:28.660
- Thank you.

28:28.680 --> 28:31.200
- I saw the police officer
arrest Mr. Wilkes.

28:31.220 --> 28:32.830
- You're referring to
Officer Atwater?

28:32.850 --> 28:35.270
- That's him over there.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.370
He nearly knocked me over
when he ran past me.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.070
I was carrying my groceries.

28:39.090 --> 28:40.710
He chased Justin
around the corner,

28:40.730 --> 28:41.570
and then a couple of
minutes later,

28:41.590 --> 28:43.840
he brought Justin back
in handcuffs.

28:43.860 --> 28:46.810
- Did Mr. Wilkes
appear injured to you?

28:46.830 --> 28:49.280
- He was kind've bent over.

28:49.300 --> 28:50.820
It looked like
he was in a lot of pain...

28:50.840 --> 28:54.820
Like he was having trouble
walking on his own.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.310
- Thank you.

28:58.280 --> 28:59.360
- Sounds like you knew
Mr. Wilkes

28:59.380 --> 29:01.490
from the neighborhood.
- We say hi.

29:01.510 --> 29:04.430
- So, you knew that
he was a drug dealer?

29:04.450 --> 29:05.730
- He didn't need to die for it.

29:05.750 --> 29:07.470
- Non-responsive...
Motion to strike?

29:07.490 --> 29:08.530
- Granted.

29:08.550 --> 29:10.870
The jury will disregard
the witness's last remark.

29:10.890 --> 29:12.270
- Have you ever been arrested,
Ms. Davis?

29:12.290 --> 29:14.310
- Uh, relevance?
- Credibility, Your Honor?

29:14.330 --> 29:15.810
- I'll allow it.

29:15.830 --> 29:17.710
- No, I've never been arrested.

29:17.730 --> 29:19.740
- Has anyone in your immediate
family ever been arrested?

29:19.760 --> 29:22.810
- Objection.
- Overruled.

29:22.830 --> 29:25.320
- My brother, James.
He was sitting on the L.

29:25.340 --> 29:27.150
- Hm.
Why was he arrested?

29:27.170 --> 29:29.490
- They said
he was disturbing the peace.

29:29.510 --> 29:31.390
He was on his way
to the United Center.

29:31.410 --> 29:33.760
His teacher gave him a ticket
to see the Bulls.

29:33.780 --> 29:37.160
I guess being black on the L
disturbs some people.

29:37.180 --> 29:38.400
- So what you're saying,
Ms. Davis,

29:38.420 --> 29:40.400
is that your testimony
in this case

29:40.420 --> 29:42.400
may in fact be prejudiced
by your general dislike

29:42.420 --> 29:43.440
for the police force?

29:43.460 --> 29:46.140
- Objection.
- Sustained.

29:46.160 --> 29:47.730
- No more questions.

29:58.570 --> 30:02.220
- We shouldn't be talking.
- I'll arrest myself.

30:02.240 --> 30:03.920
- What do you want me say?

30:03.940 --> 30:05.820
"It's okay"?

30:05.840 --> 30:07.290
"Thanks for trying, Antonio"?

30:07.310 --> 30:09.760
- Hey, come on.
- 'Cause it's not okay, Antonio.

30:09.780 --> 30:10.860
- I did what I could.

30:10.880 --> 30:14.200
- Yeah, it's too bad
for me, huh?

30:14.220 --> 30:16.350
Too bad it wasn't good enough.

30:21.230 --> 30:23.440
How long we ride together,
Antonio?

30:23.460 --> 30:24.940
Look at you.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.780
You moved on.

30:26.800 --> 30:28.350
Got a bigger and better house.

30:28.370 --> 30:30.950
- Look,
if it makes a difference,

30:30.970 --> 30:34.420
the vibe around the SA's office
is your lawyer's kicking ass.

30:34.440 --> 30:37.320
- You know that doesn't
mean anything.

30:37.340 --> 30:39.360
I got a badge.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.490
I'm guilty.
Case closed.

30:41.510 --> 30:43.900
- You don't know.
- I know I watched a black woman

30:43.920 --> 30:45.500
testify against me
in court today,

30:45.520 --> 30:47.200
and look at me like
I'm turning my back

30:47.220 --> 30:48.500
on my people,

30:48.520 --> 30:50.200
a people who's been
shut out of restaurants,

30:50.220 --> 30:52.460
schools, shot with firehoses,
lynched.

30:54.830 --> 30:56.940
Why does your boss
have to look at me

30:56.960 --> 30:59.610
like I'm the one
doing the lynching?

30:59.630 --> 31:00.950
- I see a guy doing his job.

31:00.970 --> 31:02.610
