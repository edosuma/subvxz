10:54.195 --> 10:55.112
YOU KNOW I WON'T LET ANYTHING
STAND IN OUR WAY.

10:55.196 --> 10:58.407
- [footsteps]

10:58.491 --> 10:59.408
- IS SOMEONE THERE?

10:59.492 --> 11:02.119
- WELL, I'LL GO AND LOOK.

11:02.203 --> 11:02.787
SHALL I?

11:10.961 --> 11:13.756
[lightning crashes]

11:26.394 --> 11:29.063
[lightning crashes]

11:30.356 --> 11:33.234
[thunder crashing]

11:37.363 --> 11:41.158
[thunder crashing]

11:47.706 --> 11:48.749
- WELL, SEE ANYTHING?

11:48.833 --> 11:51.085
- NO.

11:51.168 --> 11:56.799
THERE'S NO ONE HERE.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.552
- OKAY, THIS IS GETTING
TOO RISKY.

11:59.635 --> 12:02.471
- IF I WERE YOU,
I WOULDN'T RUN THE RISK

12:02.555 --> 12:04.014
OF GOING BACK ON OUR DEAL.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.644
GOOD NIGHT, JASPER.

12:26.954 --> 12:27.997
- PROJECTS DUE IN TOMORROW.

12:28.080 --> 12:30.166
PLEASE, NO EXCUSES.

12:30.249 --> 12:31.667
AND ALFIE, JEROME,

12:31.750 --> 12:34.795
WE ALL KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE
A DOG,

12:34.879 --> 12:37.506
SO THAT PARTICULAR EXCUSE
WON'T FLY.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
- WE DO HAVE A GOOSE,
AND THAT DOES FLY

12:38.674 --> 12:40.509
AND EAT INAPPROPRIATE THINGS.

12:40.593 --> 12:41.886
- SHUT UP!

12:43.387 --> 12:45.097
- SO WHAT'S THE PLAN TONIGHT?

12:45.181 --> 12:48.350
- WE NEED TO GET BETTER AT
DODGING THOSE SPIDER THREADS.

12:48.434 --> 12:50.019
MORE PRACTICE LATER?

12:50.102 --> 12:51.520
- OH, YOU BETTER COUNT ME OUT.

12:51.604 --> 12:55.483
DETENTION DATE WITH EL VICTORO.

12:55.566 --> 12:58.152
- HI.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.529
- AH, HELLO, TRUDY.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.655
EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:01.739 --> 13:02.865
- YES.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.159
OH, I'M JUST BEING SILLY
ABOUT SOMETHING.

13:05.242 --> 13:06.202
THAT'S ALL.

13:06.285 --> 13:08.370
IT'S--WELL, IT'S ABOUT VERA.

13:08.454 --> 13:11.540
- WHAT ABOUT HER?

13:11.624 --> 13:14.710
- DO YOU THINK THERE'S SOMETHING
ABOUT HER,

13:14.793 --> 13:17.588
SOMETHING THAT JUST DOESN'T
ADD UP?

13:17.671 --> 13:20.007
- WELL, THERE ARE A FEW THINGS

13:20.090 --> 13:23.052
THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ARE
A LITTLE STRANGE.

13:23.135 --> 13:24.011
- SUCH AS?

13:24.094 --> 13:25.221
- I DON'T KNOW.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.388
ERIC SAID THAT SHE WAS
THE ONLY APPLICANT

13:26.472 --> 13:29.225
FOR YOUR OLD JOB.

13:29.308 --> 13:31.977
BUT I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER
PUTTING A WHOLE PILE OF RESUMES

13:32.061 --> 13:33.229
ON HIS DESK.

13:33.312 --> 13:34.855
- WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK
HAPPENED TO THEM?

13:34.939 --> 13:37.733
- WELL, LEAVE IT WITH ME, TRUDY.

13:37.816 --> 13:39.902
I'LL DO SOME DIGGING.

13:50.704 --> 13:51.956
- HE'S KIND OF CUTE, ISN'T HE?

13:52.039 --> 13:53.624
FOR A GOOSE, I MEAN.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.503
- ALL I SEE IS A FEATHERY
GEM EATER

13:57.586 --> 14:00.589
MOCKING ME WITH HIS EXCEPTIONAL
BOWEL CONTROL.

14:00.673 --> 14:04.134
- USUALLY, IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,

14:04.218 --> 14:07.638
HOW OFTEN DO GEESE, LIKE, GO,

14:07.721 --> 14:08.347
ON AVERAGE?

14:08.430 --> 14:10.432
- ALL I KNOW IS,

14:10.516 --> 14:12.726
INSIDE THAT BIRD
IS SOMETHING I NEED.

14:12.810 --> 14:14.937
AND SOONER OR LATER NATURE
AND GRAVITY

14:15.020 --> 14:18.440
WILL WORK THEIR SWEET,
SWEET MAGIC.

14:18.524 --> 14:20.859
IF ONLY I KNEW A WAY TO MAKE IT
HAPPEN FASTER.

14:20.943 --> 14:22.236
- I DO.
I ORDERED IT OFF THE INTERNET.

14:22.319 --> 14:23.445
- ORDERED WHAT?

14:23.529 --> 14:24.697
- RUFFRUFF'S PET LAX.

14:24.780 --> 14:26.156
IT SHOULD ARRIVE TODAY.

14:26.240 --> 14:29.451
IT'S FULL OF ROUGHAGE
TO HELP DOGS GET THINGS MOVING.

14:29.535 --> 14:31.328
FEATHERED OR FUR, THE PROCESS IS
BASICALLY THE SAME.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.706
- THEN HURRAH FOR THE INTERNET.

14:40.379 --> 14:42.631
- WATCH OUT FOR THE FLOWERS,
LOSERS.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.009
SOME OF US ARE
HARD AT WORK HERE.

14:46.885 --> 14:48.178
- NICE KICK.

14:48.262 --> 14:50.472
- WELL, I DID USED TO PLAY
FOR MY SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.724
- REALLY?

14:51.807 --> 14:52.516
I JUST DIDN'T FIGURE YOU WERE
A LADY JOCK,

14:52.600 --> 14:55.644
EVEN IF IT WAS JUST SOCCER.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.646
- UH, NO.
NOT "SOCCER."

14:57.730 --> 15:00.149
FOOTBALL, REAL FOOTBALL.

15:00.232 --> 15:01.191
- [scoffs]

15:01.275 --> 15:02.651
CAN I ASSUME BY THE TONE
OF YOUR VOICE

15:02.735 --> 15:04.153
YOU DON'T THINK A LOT
OF OUR GREAT GAME?

15:04.236 --> 15:06.905
- YEAH, UNTIL PROVEN OTHERWISE.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.576
- [chuckles]

15:10.659 --> 15:11.827
IS THAT A CHALLENGE?

15:15.623 --> 15:19.918
- WELL, VERA, MY FORGER FINALLY
CAME THROUGH WITH THE GOODS.

15:20.002 --> 15:23.339
- OH, IT'S BIGGER
THAN I EXPECTED.

15:23.422 --> 15:24.757
- NO, NO, NOT THAT.

15:24.840 --> 15:25.382
NO, I FOUND THAT
ON THE DOORSTEP.

15:25.466 --> 15:27.217
NO.

15:28.344 --> 15:29.219
THIS IS IT.

15:29.303 --> 15:30.596
- OH, MY GOODNESS.

15:30.679 --> 15:32.681
WELL, THEY'RE IDENTICAL.

15:32.765 --> 15:35.017
THEY EVEN WEIGH THE SAME.

15:35.100 --> 15:36.185
- I KNOW.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.145
WE MUST PLANT THIS
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

15:38.228 --> 15:39.355
- DON'T WORRY.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.522
I'LL ENSURE THAT THE COAST
IS CLEAR.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.191
WHAT IS IN THIS PARCEL?

15:42.274 --> 15:43.984
"RUFFRUFF PET LAX"?

15:44.068 --> 15:44.485
WHO ORDERED THIS?

15:44.568 --> 15:46.445
- LET ME--

15:46.528 --> 15:49.031
THEY KNOW THE RULES ABOUT PETS.

15:49.114 --> 15:53.452
BUT THIS MIGHT WORK
TO OUR ADVANTAGE.

15:55.329 --> 15:56.497
- YOU READY?

15:56.580 --> 15:58.040
THIS GAME IS NOT FOR LADIES.

15:58.123 --> 16:00.709
- HEY, I AM NOT A LADY.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.881
- [screaming]

16:05.964 --> 16:08.342
[laughter]

16:08.425 --> 16:10.719
THAT WAS AWESOME.

16:10.803 --> 16:11.929
- [chuckles]

16:14.139 --> 16:19.395
- NOW MY TURN.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.277
- EVERYONE INTO
THE LIVING ROOM IMMEDIATELY.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.781
COME ALONG.

16:30.864 --> 16:31.949
- SORRY, VICTOR.

16:32.032 --> 16:33.534
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

16:33.617 --> 16:36.203
- YEAH, ALFIE AND I HAVE
HOMEWORK TO IGNORE.

16:36.286 --> 16:37.454
- SIT DOWN, ALL OF YOU.

16:37.538 --> 16:39.498
BE QUIET.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.462
THIS ARRIVED TODAY.

16:45.546 --> 16:48.799
THE RECIPIENT IS A MYSTERY.

16:48.882 --> 16:53.804
HOWEVER, THE CONTENTS ARE NOT.

16:53.887 --> 16:54.930
PET FOOD.

16:56.598 --> 16:57.641
THE RULES ARE VERY CLEAR.

16:57.725 --> 17:01.937
PETS ARE STRICTLY PROHIBITED
AT ANUBIS HOUSE.

17:02.020 --> 17:06.692
IF ONE OF YOU IS FOUND
TO BE HARBORING ONE,

17:06.775 --> 17:08.902
THE PUNISHMENT WILL BE
MOST SEVERE.

17:08.986 --> 17:13.449
NOW, VERA WILL CHAPERONE
YOU HERE

17:13.531 --> 17:17.786
WHILST I CONDUCT A THOROUGH
SEARCH OF THE ENTIRE HOUSE,

17:17.869 --> 17:20.955
STARTING UPSTAIRS.

17:25.961 --> 17:27.588
- REMIND ME.

17:27.671 --> 17:30.424
WE LEFT THE GOOSE
ON THE BED IN PLAIN SIGHT,

17:30.507 --> 17:32.176
DIDN'T WE?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.970
- YEAH.

17:35.053 --> 17:38.599
- GOOD, BECAUSE FOR A MOMENT
THERE I WAS WORRIED

17:38.682 --> 17:41.143
THAT VICTOR WOULDN'T FIND HIM.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.353
- THIS IS REALLY BAD.
- I KNOW.

17:43.437 --> 17:45.981
WHAT IF VICTOR FINDS OUT
I ADOPTED A GIANT PANDA?

17:46.064 --> 17:47.149
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE KIND
OF PET

17:47.232 --> 17:49.026
VICTOR'S REALLY
THAT WORRIED ABOUT, AMBER.

17:49.109 --> 17:51.904
- I MEANT, WHAT IF HE FINDS
THE SPARE AMULET?

17:51.987 --> 17:52.488
- OH.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.990
OH, YEAH.

17:55.073 --> 17:56.825
THAT WOULD BE WAY WORSE.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.644
- YES.

18:23.727 --> 18:26.563
THOSE BRATS WILL NEVER KNOW.

18:44.623 --> 18:46.291
THE UPSTAIRS IS CLEAR.

18:46.375 --> 18:47.376
- OUR ROOM'S NEXT.

18:47.459 --> 18:48.961
WE HAVE TO HIDE THE GOOSE.

18:49.044 --> 18:51.255
- VICTOR, CAN WE GO GET
SOME OF OUR SCHOOL BOOKS?

18:51.338 --> 18:53.173
- NO, NO,
YOU HEARD WHAT I SAID.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.633
I SAID YOU ARE TO--
- YEAH, BUT NO OFFENSE,

18:54.716 --> 18:55.759
THIS IS BORING.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.261
- HEY, EVERYONE.

18:57.344 --> 18:57.845
- PLEASE, JUST ONE
TRASHY MAGAZINE.

18:57.928 --> 18:59.930
HAVE A HEART.

19:00.013 --> 19:01.181
- AND WE HAVE SO MANY TESTS
TO STUDY FOR.

19:01.265 --> 19:02.683
[both shouting]

19:02.766 --> 19:04.560
- QUIET!

19:04.643 --> 19:06.854
- I AM SURE IT WILL BE FINE,
VICTOR.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.897
AFTER ALL, THEIR ROOM HAS
ALREADY BEEN SEARCHED,

19:08.981 --> 19:09.898
HASN'T IT?

19:09.982 --> 19:13.735
- VERY WELL, BUT MAKE IT QUICK.

19:15.487 --> 19:18.323
[both whispering indistinctly]

19:21.743 --> 19:23.120
- CHECK THE DOLLHOUSE.

19:25.956 --> 19:28.208
- JUST WHERE WE LEFT IT.

19:33.046 --> 19:33.881
- COME ON.
THIS OBVIOUSLY HURTS.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.133
- NO, YOU'RE WEAK.

19:36.216 --> 19:37.259
ADMIT IT AND MOVE ON.

19:37.926 --> 19:39.303
- NO.

19:39.386 --> 19:40.470
NO, NO, NO.

19:40.554 --> 19:41.680
- ADMIT IT AND MOVE ON.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.724
- NOT THAT, DOOFUS.

19:43.807 --> 19:45.142
CAN I GO, VERA?

19:45.225 --> 19:47.895
I'VE GOT TO GO
AND CHECK ON SOMETHING.

19:47.978 --> 19:48.979
- OF COURSE,

19:49.062 --> 19:51.440
JUST AS SOON AS VICTOR
SAYS IT'S OKAY.

19:51.523 --> 19:52.608
- OH!

19:52.691 --> 19:54.860
NO.

20:00.198 --> 20:04.786
- LOOK, LET'S JUST GET IT
OUT OF THE WAY:

20:04.870 --> 20:08.415
THE BALL, OUR KISS.

20:11.251 --> 20:13.629
I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT, OKAY?

20:13.712 --> 20:16.048
IT WAS A BIT SNEAKY OF ME.

20:19.593 --> 20:20.510
- JOY, I DON'T--

20:20.594 --> 20:22.638
- IT'S ONLY BECAUSE I LIKE YOU.

20:24.431 --> 20:28.060
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

20:29.227 --> 20:30.145
DO YOU THINK THERE'S EVER

20:30.228 --> 20:32.606
A CHANCE OF US
HANGING OUT

20:32.689 --> 20:34.483
LIKE WE USED TO,
JUST A BIT--

20:34.566 --> 20:37.110
A BIT MORE DATE-Y?

20:37.194 --> 20:39.905
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T SAY YES.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.657
- [squeaks]

20:41.740 --> 20:45.118
- WHATEVER YOU DO,
DON'T SAY NO EITHER.

20:45.202 --> 20:46.286
- MAYBE?

20:46.370 --> 20:48.163
- REALLY?

20:48.246 --> 20:49.247
- [squeaks]

20:49.331 --> 20:51.083
- GREAT.

20:58.298 --> 21:01.885
- COME ON.
IT MUST BE HERE.

21:01.969 --> 21:03.971
[goose honking]

21:04.054 --> 21:04.930
- ALFIE.

21:05.013 --> 21:07.516
[door creaking and slamming]

21:07.599 --> 21:08.725
- NO, NO.

21:12.270 --> 21:14.690
- WHY HAVE YOU LEFT
THE LIVING ROOM?

21:14.773 --> 21:15.315
- US?

21:15.399 --> 21:17.484
WE'RE POLISHING.

21:17.567 --> 21:20.070
- IT'S SO UNFAIR THAT VERA
HAS TO DO THIS BY HERSELF.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.530
[good honks]

21:21.613 --> 21:22.572
- [clears throat]

21:22.656 --> 21:24.032
- WHAT WAS THAT?
- THAT WAS ME.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.534
MY BAD STOMACH.

21:25.617 --> 21:26.910
IT'S NOT BEEN THE SAME SINCE
EATING ALL THOSE CARROTS.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.787
- IT'S VERY SAD.

21:28.870 --> 21:29.788
[goose honking]

21:29.871 --> 21:32.916
- [coughing]

21:33.542 --> 21:35.085
- HE'LL BE FINE.

21:35.168 --> 21:38.213
- [coughing]

21:39.339 --> 21:40.882
- GO AND GET A GLASS OF WATER.

21:40.966 --> 21:43.343
- WATER, YEAH, THANKS.

21:47.723 --> 21:50.642
- VICTOR, PATRICIA HAS LEFT
THE HOUSE WITHOUT PERMISSION.

21:56.398 --> 21:57.733
[goose honks]

22:04.740 --> 22:06.783
- NO!

22:08.160 --> 22:10.579
COME ON.
IT MUST BE HERE.
