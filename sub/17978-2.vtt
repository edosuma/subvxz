08:44.299 --> 08:45.433
OR IT COULD
HAVE BEEN

08:45.466 --> 08:47.801
THAT COMMENT YOU MADE
ABOUT HIS MOVIE,

08:47.834 --> 08:49.267
ZOMBIES ON A TRAIN,

08:49.299 --> 08:51.100
AND HOW IT APPEALED
TO THE PEOPLE

08:51.133 --> 08:53.234
WITH THE INTELLECT OF A TROLL.

08:54.433 --> 08:56.267
YEAH.

08:56.299 --> 08:58.299
IF YOU HAVE A SOCIAL LIFE,

08:58.334 --> 09:00.000
IF YOU LIKE TO SPEND
QUALITY TIME

09:00.000 --> 09:02.133
WITH YOUR GIRLFRIEND
OR BOYFRIEND,

09:02.166 --> 09:03.867
VISIT YOUR MOTHER
ON THE WEEKENDS,

09:03.900 --> 09:05.968
GO TO THE GYM
SEVERAL TIMES A WEEK

09:06.067 --> 09:08.067
TO KEEP YOUR BODY FIT
AND HEALTHY,

09:08.067 --> 09:09.132
I RESPECT THAT.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.367
I EVEN ENVY IT,

09:11.400 --> 09:13.534
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.

09:13.567 --> 09:15.067
BECAUSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO
T.A. FOR ME,

09:15.067 --> 09:17.833
YOU SHOULDN'T EXPECT
TO HAVE A LIFE.

09:17.867 --> 09:18.934
YOU'RE ONLY HERE

09:18.968 --> 09:20.466
BECAUSE YOU ARE
INTENSELY DRIVEN,

09:20.501 --> 09:22.634
AND YOU ARE
AS DETERMINED AS I AM

09:22.667 --> 09:24.399
TO MAKE C.U.
THE DESTINATION ART SCHOOL

09:24.434 --> 09:26.466
AHEAD OF RISD AND YALE,

09:26.501 --> 09:27.800
AND THE ONLY REASON

09:27.833 --> 09:29.067
YOU CAN EVEN
CONTEMPLATE

09:29.067 --> 09:30.934
TAKING ON THIS
ADDED RESPONSIBILITY

09:30.968 --> 09:33.466
IN ADDITION TO YOUR
ALREADY INSANE COURSE LOAD

09:33.500 --> 09:34.567
AND THE HOURS
YOU SPEND

09:34.600 --> 09:38.067
IN YOUR GRADUATE STUDIO
MAKING ART

09:38.067 --> 09:40.399
IS THAT
YOU ARE YOUNG ENOUGH

09:40.433 --> 09:42.801
AND FOOLISH ENOUGH

09:42.834 --> 09:44.868
TO THINK THAT YOU CAN GET BY

09:44.901 --> 09:46.968
ON THREE HOURS OF SLEEP A NIGHT.

09:48.067 --> 09:50.600
"TONIGHT, 10:00 P.M.
I'LL BE THERE.

09:50.634 --> 09:51.834
WILL YOU?"

09:51.868 --> 09:54.299
OH, YEAH, SURE YOU WILL, PAPI.

09:54.334 --> 09:56.299
YOU CALL
YOUR COMPUTER "PAPI"?

09:56.334 --> 09:58.366
OH, NO.

09:58.399 --> 10:00.000
IT'S THIS GIRL ON OUR CHART.

10:00.000 --> 10:01.399
PAPI.

10:01.433 --> 10:02.567
YOU KNOW,
SHE HAS MORE HITS THAN SHANE.

10:02.601 --> 10:04.000
HOW DO YOU
NOT KNOW THIS?

10:04.033 --> 10:05.099
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

10:05.133 --> 10:07.267
[LAUGHS]

10:07.299 --> 10:08.868
OH, RIGHT.

10:08.900 --> 10:09.968
STUCK IN THE FAR REACHES
OF HETEROVILLE,

10:10.000 --> 10:10.968
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:11.000 --> 10:11.968
YES, IT'S SO SCARY.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.701
OOH...

10:13.734 --> 10:15.900
OOH, SCARY...

10:15.933 --> 10:17.033
I THINK I REMEMBER YOU
LURKING AROUND THERE

10:17.067 --> 10:18.234
A COUPLE YEARS AGO.

10:18.266 --> 10:19.800
BUT I DID COME TO MY SENSES.

10:19.833 --> 10:20.968
SEE, THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN YOU AND ME.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.367
HEY, GIRL.

10:23.399 --> 10:24.734
KIT, HI!
HOW ARE YOU?

10:24.766 --> 10:29.167
OH, GIRL, I'M OKAY, THANK YOU.

10:29.199 --> 10:30.567
OH, BUT I CAN TELL YOU,

10:30.600 --> 10:32.433
I SURE WOULD HAVE LOVED

10:32.466 --> 10:35.067
A LARGE GLASS OF RED WINE
AFTERWARDS.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.200
I SWEAR, I...

10:37.234 --> 10:41.133
OH, I JUST FELT SO...
SAD.

10:41.167 --> 10:42.267
I'VE NEVER HAD
AN ABORTION.

10:42.299 --> 10:44.667
IT MUST BE
REALLY HARD.

10:44.701 --> 10:46.167
I ALWAYS THOUGHT
IT WAS THE REASON

10:46.200 --> 10:47.533
WHY I HAD SO MUCH TROUBLE
GETTING PREGNANT WITH ANGELICA.

10:47.567 --> 10:48.801
I HAD TWO IN MY EARLY 20s.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.000
REALLY?

10:50.033 --> 10:51.334
MM-HMM.

10:51.366 --> 10:53.801
AND NOW YOU HAVE
A LITTLE ANGEL.

10:53.834 --> 10:55.000
YEAH,

10:55.033 --> 10:56.299
BUT ONLY 50% OF THE TIME.

10:56.334 --> 10:57.667
AND HER OTHER MOTHER
HAS HER

10:57.701 --> 10:59.133
THE OTHER 50% OF THE TIME,

10:59.167 --> 11:00.000
AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

11:01.534 --> 11:02.567
IT'S HARD ON BETTE,
TOO, YOU KNOW.

11:02.601 --> 11:04.067
OH...

11:04.099 --> 11:06.067
AND ANGELICA MUST
NEVER HEAR YOU SAY

11:06.099 --> 11:08.234
THAT BETTE IS ANY LESS
HER MOTHER THAN YOU ARE.

11:08.266 --> 11:09.634
I KNOW.
I WOULD NEVER SAY THAT.

11:09.666 --> 11:10.801
I...

11:10.833 --> 11:11.900
I KNOW.

11:13.433 --> 11:15.234
IT'S FINE.

11:15.266 --> 11:16.734
WELL, HOLY FUCK.

11:17.934 --> 11:20.600
AS I LIVE
AND BREATHE.

11:20.634 --> 11:22.234
[TINA]:
WOW. SHANE...

11:22.266 --> 11:25.800
[KIT]: WELL, LOOK
WHO FINALLY SHOWED UP.

11:27.833 --> 11:30.600
WELL, WELL, WELL.

11:30.634 --> 11:32.433
I WAS WONDERING WHEN
SHE WOULD RE-EMERGE.

11:32.466 --> 11:33.933
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

11:33.968 --> 11:34.968
HEY.
PRETTY GOOD.

11:35.067 --> 11:36.901
HEY.

11:36.933 --> 11:39.067
LOOKS LIKE
CARMEN FOUND YOU.

11:41.200 --> 11:43.234
SO WHO'S THIS
GENTLEMAN, HUH?

11:43.267 --> 11:44.634
SHAY.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.100
WELL, HI, SHAY.

11:46.133 --> 11:47.433
NICE TO MEET YOU.

11:47.466 --> 11:48.767
YOU HUNGRY?

11:48.801 --> 11:49.834
WHY DON'T YOU
COME ON OVER HERE,

11:49.868 --> 11:51.334
AND I'LL HOOK YOU UP,

11:51.366 --> 11:53.100
AND YOU CAN TALK
TO YOUR FRIENDS.

11:57.167 --> 11:58.868
HEY.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.066
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

12:01.066 --> 12:02.434
YEAH, YOU TOO.

12:04.133 --> 12:05.200
IT WAS NICE
GETTING TO KNOW YOU, ERIC.

12:05.234 --> 12:06.267
WE'LL TALK SOON.

12:06.299 --> 12:07.299
THANK YOU FOR
YOUR TIME, DEAN PORTER.

12:07.333 --> 12:08.367
SURE.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.534
AND WHAT WAS
THAT MATERIAL CALLED?

12:09.567 --> 12:10.734
OH, SYNDECRETE.

12:10.766 --> 12:11.933
IT'S AMAZING STUFF.

12:11.968 --> 12:13.801
IT WAS DEVELOPED
BY DAVID HERTZ.

12:13.833 --> 12:14.868
RIGHT.
I'LL LOOK INTO IT.

12:14.900 --> 12:15.968
OKAY.

12:16.067 --> 12:17.067
AND NEXT, WE HAVE...

12:17.067 --> 12:18.533
NADIA.

12:18.567 --> 12:19.766
DON'T TELL ME.

12:20.867 --> 12:22.067
NADIA KARELLA.

12:22.067 --> 12:24.100
THAT'S VERY GOOD, DEAN PORTER.

12:24.132 --> 12:25.934
IT'S ITALIAN?

12:25.968 --> 12:27.199
HAVE YOU HEARD BACK
FROM FRANKLIN YET, JAMES?

12:27.234 --> 12:28.234
OH, YEAH.

12:28.266 --> 12:30.199
HE'S COMING TO
THE PLANNING BRUNCH,

12:30.234 --> 12:31.266
AND HE SAID
HE'D BE HONORED

12:31.300 --> 12:32.366
TO JOIN
THE COMMITTEE.

12:32.399 --> 12:33.366
IT'S GREEK.

12:33.399 --> 12:35.267
IT'S MY STEPFATHER'S NAME.

12:35.299 --> 12:36.267
OH, GREAT.

12:36.299 --> 12:37.466
I LOVE GREECE.

12:37.500 --> 12:39.433
I USED TO SPEND EVERY SUMMER
IN MYKONOS.

12:39.466 --> 12:41.933
A BUNCH OF ARTISTS
AND COLLECTORS...

12:41.968 --> 12:43.500
MY STEPFATHER HAS
A HOUSE IN MYKONOS.

12:43.533 --> 12:44.500
OH, GREAT.

12:44.533 --> 12:45.901
COME ON IN.

12:48.734 --> 12:50.767
SHAY, I KNOW
YOU'RE GOING TO LOVE

12:50.801 --> 12:51.868
THESE FRENCH FRIES.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.067
HUH?

12:53.067 --> 12:54.500
YOU WANT
SOME KETCHUP?

12:56.734 --> 12:57.868
HEY, SHAY?

12:57.901 --> 12:58.600
YOU DOING OKAY?

13:00.000 --> 13:01.933
GOOD.

13:04.333 --> 13:05.767
HELENA HATES ME, DOESN'T SHE?

13:05.801 --> 13:08.166
NO, SHE DOESN'T
HATE YOU,

13:08.199 --> 13:09.333
BUT, YOU KNOW,
APART FROM CARMEN,

13:09.367 --> 13:11.701
SHE IS THE ONE
WHO GOT HURT THE MOST.

13:14.132 --> 13:15.199
YOU KNOW SHE'S
MY ROOMMATE NOW?

13:15.234 --> 13:16.333
REALLY?

13:16.367 --> 13:18.266
MM-HMM.

13:18.300 --> 13:20.199
WELL, THEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK
I CAN DO TO MAKE IT UP TO HER?

13:20.234 --> 13:22.934
YOU GOT $40 MILLION
STASHED AWAY IN A SOCK?

13:22.968 --> 13:24.833
WHAT?

13:28.533 --> 13:30.533
I'M AN INDUSTRIAL DESIGN MAJOR.

13:30.567 --> 13:33.533
I DID GRAPHIC DESIGN
AS AN UNDERGRAD.

13:35.466 --> 13:36.701
DR. KROLL,
ACTUALLY,

13:36.734 --> 13:39.234
REALLY, UH, LIKED
THAT LAST ONE.

13:39.267 --> 13:41.100
YOU DESIGNED
THIS PROSPECTUS

13:41.133 --> 13:42.234
FOR DR. KROLL?

13:42.267 --> 13:43.299
MM-HMM.

13:43.334 --> 13:44.267
YEAH, NO,
SHE WENT ON AND ON

13:44.299 --> 13:45.399
ABOUT HOW, UH,

13:45.433 --> 13:47.868
IT WAS UTTERLY
DISTINCTIVE,

13:47.901 --> 13:49.167
BUT, UH,
SHE HAD NO IDEA

13:49.200 --> 13:51.067
THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY
COMPLETELY DERIVATIVE.

13:51.100 --> 13:52.667
OF LASZLO MOHOLY-NAGY.

13:52.701 --> 13:56.267
WELL, THAT'S ACCEPTABLE.

13:56.299 --> 13:57.567
I WAS INSPIRED
BY YOUR SHOW

13:57.600 --> 13:59.834
AT THE C.A.C.

13:59.868 --> 14:05.900
YOU INTRODUCED ME
TO MOHOLY-NAGY AND EL LISSITZKY.

14:05.934 --> 14:07.434
SO YOU SAW
THE CONSTRUCTIVISM SHOW?

14:07.466 --> 14:08.833
IT BLEW ME AWAY.

14:08.868 --> 14:11.567
I-I'D JUST ARRIVED
IN L.A.,

14:11.601 --> 14:13.166
AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE
EAST COAST GIRLS

14:13.199 --> 14:15.067
WHO, YOU KNOW,
THINKS THAT CALIFORNIA

14:15.067 --> 14:16.833
IS COMPLETELY DEVOID
OF ANY SORT OF CULTURE.

14:16.867 --> 14:18.266
WHICH IS AN OBSOLETE CLICHE.

14:18.300 --> 14:19.701
RIGHT, NO, I KNOW.

14:19.734 --> 14:20.833
I KNOW THAT NOW.

14:20.867 --> 14:22.067
[LAUGHS AWKWARDLY]

14:24.132 --> 14:25.199

14:25.234 --> 14:28.234
ARE YOU...
ARE YOU AN ATHLETE?

14:28.266 --> 14:29.533
NO.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.600
WHY?

14:30.634 --> 14:34.299
BECAUSE YOU HAVE, UH...

14:34.334 --> 14:37.767
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
VERY BEAUTIFUL ARMS.

14:37.801 --> 14:39.466
[LAUGHS]

14:39.500 --> 14:40.533
UH...

14:40.567 --> 14:41.533
I DO SOME...

14:41.567 --> 14:42.600
YOU KNOW, JUST A LITTLE YOGA

14:42.634 --> 14:44.067
EVERY
NOW AND AGAIN.

14:44.067 --> 14:45.567
I REALLY
DON'T HAVE ANY TIME

14:45.600 --> 14:47.500
TO DO ANYTHING
MORE THAN THAT.

14:47.533 --> 14:48.968
MY EX-GIRLFRIEND WAS
A PROFESSIONAL BOXER,

14:49.067 --> 14:50.133
AND YOUR ARMS
SORT OF

14:50.167 --> 14:52.267
REMIND ME OF HERS.

14:52.299 --> 14:53.267
[LAUGHS]

14:53.299 --> 14:54.734
WELL, I'M NOT A BOXER,

14:54.767 --> 14:57.100
SO I'D BETTER NOT
GET IN THE RING WITH HER.

15:01.734 --> 15:02.834
UH...

15:02.867 --> 15:04.801
ANYWAY.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.067
I HAVE TO MAKE A PRESENTATION
AT THE TRUSTEES' BRUNCH,

15:07.067 --> 15:08.234
AS YOU KNOW,

15:08.266 --> 15:09.666
AND I WOULD LIKE TO USE
A METAPHOR.

15:09.701 --> 15:11.333
I WANT TO USE
A METAPHOR ABOUT...

15:11.367 --> 15:16.132
BEING IN A NEW PLACE,
FULL OF WONDER,

15:16.167 --> 15:17.701
AND THERE'S THIS COMIC.

15:17.734 --> 15:20.199
IT'S A LITTLE BOY,
AND IT'S HIS DREAMSCAPE,

15:20.234 --> 15:21.266
AND THE DRAWINGS
ARE JUST EXQUISITE,

15:21.300 --> 15:22.367
BUT I CANNOT FOR THE LIFE OF ME

15:22.399 --> 15:23.833
REMEMBER
WHO DID THEM.

15:23.867 --> 15:24.900
WINSOR MCCAY.

15:26.100 --> 15:27.167
YOU KNOW, I THINK THAT'S RIGHT.

15:27.199 --> 15:28.533
YEAH.

LITTLE NEMO IN SLUMBERLAND.

15:29.600 --> 15:30.734
YEAH,

15:30.766 --> 15:31.766
IT'S REALLY GENIUS,
ACTUALLY.

15:31.800 --> 15:32.868
I THINK
DR. KROLL WOULD LOVE THAT.

15:32.901 --> 15:33.834
EVEN IF IT IS DERIVATIVE?

15:33.868 --> 15:35.200
NO! GOD, NO,
IT WOULDN'T BE.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.267
I MEAN, BY THE TIME
THAT WE WERE DONE WITH IT,

15:36.299 --> 15:37.366
WE COULD JUST...

15:37.399 --> 15:39.067
I-I...
UH, WOW, I'M SORRY.

15:39.067 --> 15:40.868
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS. I...

15:40.901 --> 15:41.968
WELL, YOU ARE.

15:42.067 --> 15:45.968
YOU'RE VERY PRESUMPTUOUS.

15:48.533 --> 15:49.533
BUT WHY DON'T YOU COME IN
TOMORROW MORNING,

15:49.567 --> 15:50.567
AND WE'LL GET STARTED?

15:53.067 --> 15:55.933
THEN I'VE...GOT THE JOB?

15:55.968 --> 15:57.133
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO WORK WITH YOU

15:57.167 --> 15:58.433
ON THIS PRESENTATION,

15:58.466 --> 16:00.000
AND WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.900
WHEN DO YOU WANT ME?

16:04.299 --> 16:05.299
9:00.

16:07.267 --> 16:09.400
I'LL BE HERE AT 8:30.

16:48.234 --> 16:49.767
[SIGHS NERVOUSLY]

16:55.100 --> 16:56.133

17:00.000 --> 17:02.299

A BEAUTY.

17:02.334 --> 17:04.267
PERFECT COMBINATION
OF STEP LOCATION

17:04.299 --> 17:05.767
AND ANGLES OF ATTACK.

17:06.934 --> 17:09.067
THE MERCURY E.F.I.
SUPER-VENTILATED, RIGHT?

17:09.099 --> 17:10.067
IT WAS A CHOPPY DAY,

17:10.099 --> 17:11.467
BUT I HAD HER
UP TO 88 MPH

17:11.500 --> 17:12.534
IN A MATTER
OF SECONDS.

17:12.567 --> 17:14.400

38:44.567 --> 38:45.567
SEE YOU LATER!

38:45.600 --> 38:46.600
OKAY.

38:59.167 --> 39:01.367
OH, MY GOD.

39:02.701 --> 39:04.567
REALLY?

39:04.601 --> 39:07.434
REALLY, PAPI?

39:07.466 --> 39:09.067
WOW.

39:09.099 --> 39:11.166
THAT GIRL DOES NOT QUIT.

39:12.601 --> 39:13.634
IT'S KIND OF FREAKING ME OUT.

39:13.666 --> 39:15.333
I MEAN,
SHE IS THE BOSS' DAUGHTER,

39:15.367 --> 39:18.234
AND I'M NOT EVEN
OUT AT WORK.

39:18.266 --> 39:19.900
SO YOU SHOULD COME OUT.

39:19.934 --> 39:22.167
HEY, IS IT CURVEMAG.COM
OR .NET?

39:22.199 --> 39:23.100
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

39:23.132 --> 39:24.533
COMING OUT FOR ME--

39:24.567 --> 39:26.501
IT'S NOT THE SAME
AS IT IS FOR YOU.

39:26.533 --> 39:28.533
HMM.

39:28.567 --> 39:30.199
SHE SAID THAT
IT WAS GOING TO BE OUT

39:30.234 --> 39:31.367
FIRST THING
THIS MORNING,

39:31.399 --> 39:33.399
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY I CAN'T FIND IT,

39:33.433 --> 39:35.200
BECAUSE WHEN SHE CALLED ME
TO GET SOME COMMENTS,

39:35.234 --> 39:36.968
SHE SAID THE REVIEW
WAS ALREADY DONE.

39:37.067 --> 39:38.267
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING TO
LET ME READ THE REVIEWS

39:38.299 --> 39:39.366
BEFORE YOU LOOKED AT THEM.

39:39.399 --> 39:41.100
NO, I DON'T NEED TO
WITH THIS ONE.

39:41.133 --> 39:43.100
WE HAD THIS
UNDERSTANDING,

39:43.133 --> 39:44.299
AND, YOU KNOW, I THINK

39:44.334 --> 39:45.500
THAT'S THE KIND OF THING
THAT HAPPENS

39:45.533 --> 39:47.334
WHEN TWO GAY WOMEN
SPEAK TO EACH OTHER.

39:47.366 --> 39:48.433
OH, YAY!

39:48.466 --> 39:50.067
HERE IT IS.
OKAY, READY?

41:50.634 --> 41:52.500
YOU WATCH IT.

41:52.533 --> 41:54.200

A FUCKING CUNT."

41:55.234 --> 41:56.399
OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

41:56.433 --> 41:57.500
BECAUSE STACEY MERKIN'S
A FUCKING CUNT.

NO, HE'S NOT GOING
TO SAY IT.

41:59.466 --> 42:00.000

HAVE A GREAT
DAY, JENNY.

A SECOND?

42:09.666 --> 42:10.968
JESUS...
OH, NADIA.

42:11.067 --> 42:12.467
I'M SORRY,
I-- I'M JUST SO EXCITED.

42:12.500 --> 42:13.601
I FOUND THE BOOK,

42:13.634 --> 42:15.868
AND IT IS FANTASTIC.

42:15.900 --> 42:17.833
HEADS-WILL-ROLL
IS GOING TO LOVE IT.

42:17.867 --> 42:18.900
"HEADS-WILL-ROLL?"

42:18.934 --> 42:20.132
EVC KROLL.

42:20.167 --> 42:22.399
WE CALL HER
HEADS-WILL-ROLL KROLL

42:22.434 --> 42:23.900
BECAUSE SHE FIRES
AT LEAST ONE DEAN A YEAR.

42:23.934 --> 42:30.132
OH.
LOOK AT THIS.

42:30.167 --> 42:30.234
OKAY, AS YOU KNOW,
THIS IS THE ORIGINAL.

42:32.433 --> 42:33.933
MM-HMM.

42:33.968 --> 42:37.167
BUT WE ARE GOING TO
MAKE THIS C.U.

42:37.200 --> 42:39.433
MM...

42:39.466 --> 42:41.533
AND I'M GOING TO
MAKE YOU LITTLE NEMO,

42:41.567 --> 42:42.767
BECAUSE
THIS IS YOUR DREAM

42:42.801 --> 42:45.299
FOR THE FUTURE
OF THE SCHOOL OF THE ARTS.

42:45.334 --> 42:46.466
NO...

42:46.500 --> 42:48.234
NO, LITTLE NEMO
IS A STUDENT.

42:48.267 --> 42:49.366
MAKE IT A BOY,

42:49.399 --> 42:50.466
BECAUSE MOST OF
THE TRUSTEES ARE MEN,

42:50.500 --> 42:51.533
AND THEY'RE
SO SENTIMENTAL

42:51.567 --> 42:52.868
ABOUT THEIR
BOYHOODS,

42:52.901 --> 42:54.067
AND I WANT YOU
TO FOCUS

42:54.067 --> 42:55.100
ON THE SCHOOL
OF THE ARTS,

42:55.133 --> 42:56.533
BUT I ALSO WANT YOU
TO ACKNOWLEDGE

42:56.567 --> 42:58.100
THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS
OF THE UNIVERSITY.

42:58.133 --> 43:02.467
LIKE, MAKE THIS
PHYSICS, AND...

43:02.500 --> 43:05.133
MAKE THIS ATHLETICS.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.133
OKAY?

43:07.166 --> 43:08.534
WOW.

43:08.567 --> 43:10.868
YOU...

43:10.900 --> 43:11.968
YOU'RE AMAZING.

43:14.968 --> 43:16.067
UH, PRESTON,

43:16.067 --> 43:18.567
I WAS JUST COMING
TO SEE YOU.

43:18.600 --> 43:20.434
WELL, GOOD WORK,
NADIA.

43:20.466 --> 43:21.634
SO YOU SEE WHERE
I'M GOING WITH THIS?

43:21.667 --> 43:22.766
YES, ABSOLUTELY,
I DO.

43:22.800 --> 43:23.766
THANK YOU.

43:23.800 --> 43:24.766
THANK YOU.

43:24.800 --> 43:26.199
ALL RIGHT.

43:26.234 --> 43:27.199
HEY...

43:27.234 --> 43:28.266
CAN I CALL YOU
BETTE?

43:28.300 --> 43:29.300
SHE COULD CALL ME

43:29.333 --> 43:31.867
ANYTHING SHE WANTS.

43:31.900 --> 43:33.067
"DEAN PORTER" IS JUST FINE.

43:48.466 --> 43:49.968
HEY, MARTA?

43:50.067 --> 43:52.334
CAN YOU GET MY LITTLE BROTHER
A SMOOTHIE OR SOMETHING?

43:53.500 --> 43:54.466
A SMOOTHIE?

43:54.500 --> 43:56.133
YES, A SMOOTHIE.

43:56.167 --> 43:58.200
IS IT SO HARD TO GET THE KID
A FUCKING SMOOTHIE?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.066
MARTA, DON'T
GIVE ME SHIT.

44:01.100 --> 44:02.100
JUST GET ME
A SMOOTHIE.

44:02.133 --> 44:03.701
SHANE, YOUR NEXT CLIENT'S
STILL WAITING,

44:03.734 --> 44:05.099
AND CAN I GET YOUR SIGNATURE
ON THIS THING?

44:11.801 --> 44:14.601
JODI LERNER'S GOING TO BE HERE
IN THREE WEEKS.

44:14.634 --> 44:15.833
IT'S SUCH A COUP,

44:15.868 --> 44:17.367
GETTING HER
AS AN ARTIST-IN-RESIDENCE.

44:17.399 --> 44:18.434
I LOVE IT.

44:18.466 --> 44:19.900
I WOULD ALSO LIKE
TO TRY TO COAX

44:19.934 --> 44:22.132
LEE BONTECOU
OR JOHN BALDESSARI.

44:22.167 --> 44:23.800
AND ED RUSCHA.
HE OWES ME A FAVOR.

44:23.833 --> 44:26.199
I ALSO HAVE A LIST
OF ALL OF OUR EQUIPMENT NEEDS,

44:26.234 --> 44:27.934
BECAUSE IF WE'RE TO BE
TRULY COMPETITIVE

44:27.968 --> 44:30.199
WITH THE REST OF THE TOP TIER...

44:30.234 --> 44:31.266
PHYLLIS?

44:31.300 --> 44:33.600
I'M SORRY. GO ON.

44:33.634 --> 44:34.868
YEAH.

44:34.901 --> 44:36.067
IF WE'RE TO BE
TRULY COMPETITIVE

44:36.067 --> 44:37.267
WITH THE REST
OF THE TOP TIER,

44:37.299 --> 44:38.133
THEN WE'LL NEED
TO UPGRADE

44:38.167 --> 44:40.267
OUR DIGITAL MEDIA
RESOURCES.

44:42.500 --> 44:46.801
I'VE BEEN MARRIED
23 YEARS, BETTE.

44:46.834 --> 44:48.267
I HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

44:48.299 --> 44:51.466
THEY'RE BOTH
GONE AWAY TO COLLEGE.

44:51.500 --> 44:52.868
ARE YOU OKAY, PHYLLIS?

44:54.399 --> 44:57.299
ARE YOUR CHILDREN
OKAY?

44:57.334 --> 44:58.734
HAVE YOU EVER
HAD THE CONVICTION

44:58.767 --> 45:00.000
YOU'VE BEEN LIVING A LIE
YOUR WHOLE LIFE?

45:02.299 --> 45:03.334
NO.

45:03.367 --> 45:04.434
ACTUALLY, I HAVEN'T.

45:04.466 --> 45:07.133
NO, OF COURSE NOT.

45:07.166 --> 45:08.634
YOU'RE COURAGEOUS.

45:08.666 --> 45:12.099
YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
BOLDLY, HONESTLY.

45:12.132 --> 45:16.100
I WISH
I COULD TAKE YOUR EXAMPLE.

45:16.132 --> 45:20.167
PHYLLIS, YOU ARE A WOMAN
OF INCREDIBLE ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

45:20.199 --> 45:21.766
I CANNOT POSSIBLY SEE--

45:21.800 --> 45:24.199
I THINK I'M A LESBIAN, BETTE.

45:27.367 --> 45:29.867
OH.

45:29.900 --> 45:31.800
[INHALES]

45:34.466 --> 45:35.500

45:35.533 --> 45:38.701

45:38.734 --> 45:40.067
I'VE KNOWN IT

45:40.100 --> 45:42.100
SINCE I FELL IN LOVE
WITH MY COLLEGE ROOMMATE.

45:42.133 --> 45:43.933
MM...

45:43.968 --> 45:45.433
WE DIDN'T
ACT ON IT.

45:45.466 --> 45:48.701
I WAS TOO AFRAID.

45:48.734 --> 45:52.267
[VOICE BREAKING]:
IT DIDN'T FIT IN WITH MY LIFE.

45:52.299 --> 45:53.366
GOSH...

45:53.399 --> 45:54.466
I WONDER WHERE SHE IS.

45:54.500 --> 45:57.067
I WONDER IF SHE EVEN REMEMBERS.

45:57.067 --> 46:00.000
I JUST CAN'T KEEP THIS INSIDE
ANYMORE, BETTE.

46:00.000 --> 46:01.734
DO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

46:01.766 --> 46:03.766
I-- NO...

46:03.801 --> 46:05.067
WAIT, NO, NO, I DON'T.

46:05.099 --> 46:06.734
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

46:06.767 --> 46:08.067
I HAVE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT THESE FEELINGS.

46:08.067 --> 46:10.234
I HAVE TO FIND OUT
ABOUT WHAT I'VE MISSED.

46:10.266 --> 46:12.234
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU...

46:12.266 --> 46:13.734
WHY DON'T YOU TALK TO SOMEONE?

46:13.766 --> 46:15.067
I MEAN, MAYBE A THERAPIST,

46:15.067 --> 46:18.067
I'VE BEEN LYING TO MY THERAPIST
FOR YEARS.

46:18.100 --> 46:19.399
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, BETTE.

46:19.434 --> 46:20.833
ME?

46:23.766 --> 46:24.968
WHY ME?

46:25.067 --> 46:26.833
BECAUSE YOU SEEM
SO COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

[SIGHS HEAVILY]

HOW YOU'VE DONE THAT.

46:34.466 --> 46:35.801
IT'S A PROCESS, PHYLLIS.

46:35.834 --> 46:37.667
I MEAN, IT WASN'T ALWAYS EASY.

46:39.167 --> 46:44.667
GOD, I SURE AS HELL HOPE
IT'S NOT TOO LATE FOR ME.

46:44.701 --> 46:46.667

TOO LATE.

46:57.067 --> 46:58.801
WHERE IS SHE?

46:58.834 --> 47:00.000
I WANT HER
TO LOOK ME IN THE EYE,

47:00.000 --> 47:02.133
AND SAY ALL OF THIS
TO MY FACE.

47:02.166 --> 47:03.266
SHE'S A FREELANCE WRITER.
