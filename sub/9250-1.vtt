03:23.200 --> 03:24.713
Apologies, miss.

03:24.800 --> 03:26.552
I didn't know
how else to wake you.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.195
The Heelshires had to
step out for a moment.

03:29.720 --> 03:30.789
They beg
your pardon, miss,

03:30.880 --> 03:32.836
and they ask that
you wait in the parlor.

03:33.080 --> 03:35.514
It's like something out of
a storybook, isn't it?

03:36.000 --> 03:38.560
Oh, the Heelshires have
already taken care of that.

03:38.720 --> 03:40.358
And I put
your things inside.

03:40.520 --> 03:41.839
Thanks.

03:52.120 --> 03:53.189
(DOOR SHUTS)

04:19.480 --> 04:20.480
(EXHALES)

04:23.120 --> 04:24.633
Whoa.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.035
(DOOR SHUTS)

04:31.360 --> 04:33.669
Is anyone up there? Hi.

05:05.840 --> 05:07.239
(DISTANT RUMBLING)

05:24.760 --> 05:26.398
Is anyone up here?

05:51.800 --> 05:52.800
(TWANGS)

05:56.240 --> 05:57.309
(CHUCKLES)

06:01.000 --> 06:02.513
(WHIRRING)

06:06.200 --> 06:07.519
Hi there.
(GASPS)

06:09.080 --> 06:10.115
GRETA: Sorry.

06:10.800 --> 06:12.711
Believe it or not,
I was actually

06:12.800 --> 06:14.153
trying not
to scare you.

06:14.560 --> 06:16.198
No, I'm sorry
I jumped.

06:16.280 --> 06:17.998
I... I thought I heard
someone upstairs.

06:18.200 --> 06:19.200
(LAUGHS)

06:19.600 --> 06:20.669
Are you all right?

06:20.760 --> 06:23.354
(LAUGHING)
Yeah, I'm sorry. It's so stupid.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.318
Are you Mr. Heelshire?
No.

06:25.400 --> 06:26.435
I know you're not. Yeah.
(LAUGHS)

06:26.520 --> 06:28.351
Uh, no,
I'm the grocery boy.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.431
Well, grocery man.
You know.

06:31.360 --> 06:32.429
I own the shop,
actually.

06:32.520 --> 06:33.555
(LAUGHS)

06:33.680 --> 06:34.715
Okay. I'm Malcolm,
by the way.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.800
Hi.

06:35.880 --> 06:36.869
You must be here
for the nanny job.

06:37.000 --> 06:38.353
Yeah. Greta Evans.

06:38.680 --> 06:39.829
I've got some groceries
to unpack downstairs

06:39.960 --> 06:41.075
if you want to join me.

06:41.160 --> 06:44.311
I could give you a tour
of such exotic locations...

06:44.520 --> 06:46.875
Uh, as the pantry
and bread bin.

06:47.000 --> 06:47.989
Does that interest you?
(CHUCKLES)

06:48.120 --> 06:50.395
Sounds great. Sure.
Lead the way.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.280
MALCOLM:
You're American, yeah?

06:53.000 --> 06:56.197
Yeah.
My first trip to the UK.

06:56.600 --> 06:58.192
All right,
let me guess.

06:58.880 --> 07:00.711
California, right?

07:01.680 --> 07:03.398
Montana. In this?
Oh.

07:03.520 --> 07:04.600
Yeah.
It goes in the basket.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.440
You know, I'm usually
so good at these things.

07:06.600 --> 07:07.794
I've got a touch
of the gift.

07:07.880 --> 07:09.029
The gift?

07:09.240 --> 07:11.674
Prognosticator, clairvoyant,
whatever you like to call it.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.239
Uh, I had a grandmother
that read tea leaves.

07:13.320 --> 07:14.878
My mother read palms, so...

07:16.280 --> 07:18.077
Okay, what do you read?

07:18.360 --> 07:20.078
Me?
Yeah.

07:20.480 --> 07:21.480
Uh...

07:23.880 --> 07:25.108
Chewing gum.

07:25.520 --> 07:27.192
Okay. (LAUGHS)

07:27.400 --> 07:29.868
We don't get to choose
our gifts, Miss Evans.

07:29.960 --> 07:32.599
Come on, if you'll allow me.
Don't be shy.

07:33.000 --> 07:34.274
Allow you to...

07:35.360 --> 07:36.679
Yeah, I'm going to
read your gum.

07:36.760 --> 07:38.432
I'm a professional.
Trust me.

07:38.640 --> 07:39.755
Okay.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.513
Oh, my God.

07:42.080 --> 07:44.674
All right.
Oh. Okay.

07:45.040 --> 07:46.040
Huh.

07:46.120 --> 07:47.917
Interesting
teeth marks. Uh...

07:48.080 --> 07:49.195
(CHUCKLES)

07:49.320 --> 07:51.470
I see that
you're a writer...

07:52.240 --> 07:54.470
From Phoenix, Montana.

07:54.640 --> 07:55.914
It looks like
you've come here

07:56.000 --> 07:57.991
to be inspired by
the English countryside...

07:58.160 --> 07:59.798
To get away from
the hustle and bustle

07:59.880 --> 08:01.199
of your life
in the US of A.

08:01.560 --> 08:02.629
No.

08:02.800 --> 08:04.472
Close.
Um...

08:04.760 --> 08:07.115
Not at all. No.

08:07.680 --> 08:09.033
Okay, one more try.
Okay.

08:09.200 --> 08:10.519
Okay? Just one.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.073
Ah. Okay.

08:13.280 --> 08:14.759
Okay, I see where
we went wrong now.

08:14.840 --> 08:16.353
It's very obvious now.
Of course.

08:16.960 --> 08:18.154
Um...

08:18.480 --> 08:20.277
I see a dark past.

08:20.440 --> 08:22.829
On the run from someone,
are we? (CHUCKLES)

08:23.240 --> 08:25.071
That's what
it looks like.

08:28.640 --> 08:30.358
I'll throw it away now.

08:34.360 --> 08:36.316
I'm afraid that was my
best attempt at flirting.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.389
Believe it or not,
I'm actually

08:37.480 --> 08:38.913
considered charming
in this country.

08:39.120 --> 08:40.188
It's okay.

08:40.760 --> 08:42.159
It's amazing that
any of us manage

08:42.240 --> 08:43.798
to procreate
at all, really.

08:44.159 --> 08:45.275
Bread?

08:45.360 --> 08:46.759
Yeah, in
the cupboard behind.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.833
So... Um...

08:53.000 --> 08:55.514
So, what's
the family like?

08:56.800 --> 08:58.631
Well, they're nice,
you know?

08:58.720 --> 09:00.039
They're very generous.

09:00.200 --> 09:02.350
As good a people as
you'll ever hope to meet.

09:02.960 --> 09:05.315
And the son? Brahms?

09:05.720 --> 09:06.914
Brahms.

09:07.600 --> 09:08.919
Oh, he's, um...

09:09.000 --> 09:10.228
Uh...
(DOOR OPENS)

09:10.360 --> 09:12.828
I'm not sure quite
how to explain it, really.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.868
Oh, look.

09:15.360 --> 09:16.759
GRETA: Mrs. Heelshire...

09:17.400 --> 09:20.198
(SIGHS) It's so nice
to finally meet you.

09:21.520 --> 09:23.829
Hmm. Where are your shoes?

09:24.320 --> 09:25.320
Uh...

09:27.680 --> 09:30.399
Brahms is very excited
to meet you, Miss Evans.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.550
He's never met
an American before.

09:32.640 --> 09:34.835
I'm very excited
to meet him, too.

09:35.400 --> 09:36.515
I, um...

09:36.800 --> 09:39.234
I was sure I left
my shoes right here.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.909
They'll turn up.

09:42.000 --> 09:44.309
It's Brahms.
He can be playful.

09:44.960 --> 09:46.678
I assume you brought
other shoes.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.159
Yes, I did.

09:48.600 --> 09:49.669
Then let's hurry up.

09:49.760 --> 09:51.990
We've kept them
waiting long enough.

09:52.880 --> 09:54.154
MR. HEELSHIRE:
Her name is Miss Evans.

09:54.280 --> 09:56.794
So, we want you to be
on your very best behavior.

09:57.240 --> 10:00.198
You're looking very smart.
You know, I like that tie.

10:00.360 --> 10:01.509
Do you know
why I like that tie?

10:01.600 --> 10:02.749
Daddy.

10:05.160 --> 10:08.197
Miss Evans, allow me
to introduce Mr. Heelshire.

10:08.600 --> 10:09.828
Miss Evans.

10:10.520 --> 10:13.990
And this is
our son, Brahms.

10:16.920 --> 10:18.672
(LAUGHS)

10:24.600 --> 10:25.749
(CLEARS THROAT)

10:32.040 --> 10:33.951
MALCOLM: So,
you've met Brahms then.

10:37.560 --> 10:39.551
How are you doing,
Brahms? Eh?

10:41.840 --> 10:44.115
Now, you take it easy
on Miss Evans.

10:44.280 --> 10:47.397
She's traveled a long way
just to meet you.

10:49.680 --> 10:51.591
I'll be off then.
The bill's on the table.

10:51.720 --> 10:52.869
A pleasure to meet you,
Miss Evans.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.678
I hope to see you
on my next delivery.

10:54.760 --> 10:55.795
MRS. HEELSHIRE:
Thank you, Malcolm.

10:55.880 --> 10:56.995
MALCOLM: Of course.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.717
It's so nice
to meet you, Brahms.

11:16.640 --> 11:18.710
I hope that you and I
can be friends.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.676
MRS. HEELSHIRE:
Daddy, will you take Miss Evans' things

11:23.760 --> 11:25.273
up to her room, please?

11:25.440 --> 11:27.078
Miss Evans,
we might as well get started.

11:27.160 --> 11:28.639
I have a lot
to show you.

11:30.160 --> 11:31.434
MRS. HEELSHIRE:
You'll be all alone out here.

11:31.840 --> 11:33.239
Do you think
you can manage?

11:33.320 --> 11:34.548
Yeah, of course.

11:35.480 --> 11:37.440
Hmm. Well, we've had
a number of potential nannies

11:37.480 --> 11:39.072
come through already.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.230
Brahms has
rejected them all,

11:41.320 --> 11:44.949
though they weren't nearly
as young or as pretty

11:45.520 --> 11:46.873
as you.

11:47.280 --> 11:49.669
You will wake him
at 7:00 each morning

11:49.760 --> 11:51.318
and you will dress him.

11:51.840 --> 11:52.875
Okay.

11:52.960 --> 11:55.349
You'll find his
clean clothes behind you.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.989
So, I should...

12:03.120 --> 12:04.758
Wake him up and dress him,
Miss Evans.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.990
There's no better way
to learn than by doing.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.309
Okay.

12:10.720 --> 12:12.039
(WHISPERING)
Wake up, Brahms.

12:12.760 --> 12:13.909
Well, I don't
know about you,

12:14.000 --> 12:15.400
but that certainly
wouldn't wake me.

12:18.400 --> 12:20.550
It's time to
wake up, Brahms.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.710
He's not a baby,
Miss Evans.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.275
You needn't be afraid
of hurting him.

12:27.000 --> 12:28.638
Change this stuff...

12:28.720 --> 12:30.119
Excuse me. (CLEARS THROAT)

12:30.800 --> 12:31.800
Mmm-hmm.

12:32.560 --> 12:36.997
Now, let's show Miss Evans
how we get you dressed.

12:37.440 --> 12:38.555
I'd let her do it herself,

12:38.640 --> 12:40.676
but I'm afraid
we'd be here all afternoon.

12:43.080 --> 12:46.436
Brahms has three hours
of lessons five days a week

12:46.600 --> 12:48.318
and I like to start
by reading some poetry.

12:48.440 --> 12:49.668
Do you know any,
Miss Evans?

12:49.760 --> 12:50.760
Uh...

12:50.880 --> 12:53.110
I know all the words to
Green Eggs and Ham.

12:55.160 --> 12:57.879
Well, it doesn't have
to be poetry, of course.

12:58.080 --> 13:00.150
Any of these
books will do,

13:00.320 --> 13:04.313
but you must read
in a loud, clear voice.

13:04.480 --> 13:06.232
Yes, of course.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.355
(CLEARS THROAT)

13:09.960 --> 13:11.393
(LOUDLY)
Yes, of course.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.072
Excellent.

13:13.760 --> 13:16.035
Next is music
appreciation.

13:17.040 --> 13:18.712
Oh, now, Brahms.

13:19.240 --> 13:23.028
You must sit up
straight, hmm?

13:23.120 --> 13:25.111
Like a good little boy.

13:26.840 --> 13:29.274
Music, Miss Evans.

13:29.360 --> 13:30.634
I don't know how Brahms

13:30.720 --> 13:32.915
would go on
without his music.

13:33.240 --> 13:35.117
It's his world.

13:35.280 --> 13:38.352
Of course, he likes it
rather louder than I prefer...

13:38.440 --> 13:41.671
But it gives him
so much joy.

13:41.880 --> 13:44.075
I don't dare
take it away from him.

13:44.360 --> 13:46.191
(OPERA MUSIC PLAYING LOUDLY)

14:06.240 --> 14:08.390
We don't throw any food out
in this house, Miss Evans.

14:08.480 --> 14:10.072
This is a country house.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.557
Do you know
what that means?

14:13.640 --> 14:14.640
No.

14:15.480 --> 14:17.630
It means we are
in constant battle

14:17.720 --> 14:18.994
with the outside elements.

14:19.160 --> 14:22.118
Weather, plants, vermin.

14:22.280 --> 14:24.510
Especially vermin,
Miss Evans.

14:24.680 --> 14:28.434
And so we take certain
measures against them.

14:28.800 --> 14:29.800
(COOS SOFTLY)

14:30.520 --> 14:32.272
Hello, my darling.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.111
Mr. Heelshire will explain
the rest of your duties.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.840
Uh, the food
goes in here.

14:41.520 --> 14:42.635
Thank you.

14:43.400 --> 14:46.198
Now, I'll show you
the traps.

14:49.800 --> 14:51.028
(HUMMING SOFTLY)

14:51.280 --> 14:53.794
MR. HEELSHIRE:
Yes, we do our best to keep up the house.

14:53.960 --> 14:56.520
Oh, by the way, we don't use
the fireplaces anymore.

14:56.680 --> 14:57.715
A bit of a hazard.

14:57.800 --> 14:59.153
And regrettably,

14:59.240 --> 15:01.356
the last tradesman
we had actually...

15:01.440 --> 15:04.671
(CHUCKLES) He managed
to paint the windows shut.

15:05.240 --> 15:08.835
You know, personally, I don't think
that all of this is necessary,

15:09.400 --> 15:12.039
but Mrs. Heelshire is
convinced that the rats

15:12.120 --> 15:13.872
will get into the walls.

15:13.960 --> 15:15.029
And Brahms, of course,

15:15.120 --> 15:16.678
he's never been
very fond of animals.

15:16.840 --> 15:19.035
He's always been
very shy, you see.

15:19.400 --> 15:20.992
Very timid.

15:21.440 --> 15:23.271
I know how this must
look to you, Miss Evans,

15:23.400 --> 15:24.799
and to be
completely honest,

15:24.880 --> 15:27.189
I'm not sure how
it all came to this.

15:27.480 --> 15:30.790
Little by little and then
all at once, I suppose.

15:31.640 --> 15:32.755
Mmm.

15:33.800 --> 15:35.313
What I'm trying
to say is that

15:35.400 --> 15:37.675

I've checked every nook and
cranny of this very lovely,

41:08.040 --> 41:10.076

and large house.

41:10.480 --> 41:11.629

are sealed tight.

41:11.720 --> 41:13.153

41:14.040 --> 41:15.871
There was someone in here.
I know it.

41:16.600 --> 41:17.749
My clothes.

41:18.560 --> 41:19.560
You know,

41:19.640 --> 41:21.551
I used to sleepwalk
when I was a boy.

41:22.880 --> 41:24.632
I wasn't sleepwalking.

41:24.880 --> 41:26.472
Well, I could stick around
for a bit...

41:26.560 --> 41:28.120
Make sure we don't
have some very polite

41:28.200 --> 41:29.474
burglar on our hands,

41:29.560 --> 41:30.629
coming in,
taking nothing,

41:30.720 --> 41:32.995
and then locking up after
himself before he leaves.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.998
It's really no problem.
I'm here anyway.

41:35.080 --> 41:36.080
Are you sure?

41:36.400 --> 41:37.549
Absolutely.

41:38.320 --> 41:39.320
Okay.

ready to play for money.

41:47.800 --> 41:49.119
Oh, no, thanks.

41:50.240 --> 41:53.073
So, tell me about Brahms.

41:54.720 --> 41:56.756
I told you about
all I know.

41:57.040 --> 42:00.112
Wow. That was
a truly terrible poker face.

42:00.840 --> 42:02.114
(LAUGHS)

42:03.120 --> 42:04.599
All right, what do you
want to know?

42:04.680 --> 42:07.752
What was he like?
The real Brahms.

42:09.560 --> 42:12.393
You need to know there's
two types of talk in town.

42:12.560 --> 42:15.393
There's polite talk
and pub talk, you know?

42:15.760 --> 42:18.274
And the truth is
somewhere in between.

42:18.760 --> 42:20.273
Okay, what was
the polite talk?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.080
Ah...

42:22.200 --> 42:24.077
That he was a lovely lad

42:24.240 --> 42:27.198
and it's a tragedy that he was
taken at such a young age.

42:28.120 --> 42:29.712
And the pub talk?

42:29.800 --> 42:30.869
Well, you know,

42:30.960 --> 42:32.552
that he wasn't
such a lovely lad.

42:32.640 --> 42:35.074
Yeah, that he was
downright strange.

42:36.480 --> 42:37.959
What's the truth?

42:45.560 --> 42:47.949
One night, I came out
here for a delivery.

42:48.120 --> 42:49.240
I didn't know it
at the time,

42:49.320 --> 42:51.311
but it was Brahms's birthday
or would have been.

42:51.480 --> 42:53.232
And Mrs. Heelshire,
she was in the sitting room

42:53.320 --> 42:54.912
opening presents
with the doll.

42:56.400 --> 42:57.913
And Mr. Heelshire...

42:59.560 --> 43:01.152
He was in here.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.914
Off his pickle.
(SNICKERS)

43:05.400 --> 43:08.551
Drunk and mumbling
to himself

43:08.640 --> 43:10.790
that he couldn't
do it anymore.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.678
I told him
I'd come back...

43:12.840 --> 43:13.875
But he said,
"No, no, come on.

43:13.960 --> 43:15.160
"Have a drink
with an old man."

43:15.320 --> 43:16.320
So I do.

43:16.360 --> 43:17.793
Well, we get
a couple of drinks in.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.518
We're chatting
about the weather

43:19.600 --> 43:21.272
and so on and finally...

43:22.000 --> 43:24.753
I get the courage to ask him
that exact question.

43:25.200 --> 43:27.998
"What was Brahms,
the real Brahms, like?"

43:29.960 --> 43:33.350
God, he just looks at me
with this heartbroken look.

43:34.640 --> 43:36.232
It made me sorry
I even asked.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.799
And he said one word.

43:39.480 --> 43:41.152
"Odd," he says.

43:42.200 --> 43:43.269
Odd.

43:45.320 --> 43:47.197
And that was it.

43:47.280 --> 43:49.714
Which, I suppose is all
the answer we'll ever get.

43:53.720 --> 43:54.869
My shot.

43:56.880 --> 43:59.030
Are you sure you're going
to be okay here on your own?

44:01.400 --> 44:02.515
Yeah.

44:02.680 --> 44:03.680

is their dead son.

44:07.240 --> 44:09.356
Yeah, totally trust
in their judgment.

44:09.520 --> 44:11.078
It's not like that.
He didn't have to come over here

44:11.200 --> 44:12.394
and check
the whole house.

44:12.520 --> 44:14.556
No, you watch.
You'll wake up in the middle of the night

44:14.720 --> 44:16.597
and he'll be standing over
you in your coral dress,

44:16.680 --> 44:18.272
with lipstick smeared
all over his face.

and pounding on the door.

44:35.880 --> 44:37.598
Cole told him
some story about

44:37.720 --> 44:39.836
wanting to write you a letter
apologizing for everything.

44:39.920 --> 44:41.880
Please tell me Morgan
didn't give him the address.

44:41.920 --> 44:43.560

to get rid of him.

44:43.600 --> 44:45.352

44:45.440 --> 44:46.668

44:46.760 --> 44:47.909
No, I know.

should be sorry

you guys into this.

anything wrong.

was his fault.

I came back
for you, Brahms.

01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.351
(BREATHES DEEPLY)

01:27:54.840 --> 01:27:57.479
I told you I wouldn't leave
you and I didn't, did I?

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:03.074
I told you I wouldn't.

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:11.869
Brahms!

01:28:13.720 --> 01:28:15.472
It's time for bed now.

01:28:17.920 --> 01:28:20.036
Brahms, I said
it's time for bed.

01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.593
Let's go.

01:28:26.000 --> 01:28:27.672
You know the rules.

01:28:44.920 --> 01:28:46.592
Put that down now, Brahms.

01:28:55.720 --> 01:28:57.358
Are you ready for bed?

01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:04.552
Under the covers.

01:29:14.680 --> 01:29:17.194
Be a good boy, Brahms,
and go straight to sleep, okay?

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.554
Kiss.

01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:26.752
No kiss tonight, Brahms.

01:29:28.120 --> 01:29:30.076
That's your punishment.
I'm sorry.

01:29:30.960 --> 01:29:32.075
Okay.

01:29:37.480 --> 01:29:38.833
Kiss.

01:30:02.800 --> 01:30:03.994
(GASPS)

01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:15.435
(CHOKING)

01:30:20.840 --> 01:30:21.955
Please...

01:30:33.240 --> 01:30:34.514
(GASPS)

01:30:51.880 --> 01:30:53.791
(BREATHING RAGGEDLY)

01:31:05.200 --> 01:31:06.349
Malcolm.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:09.434
Malcolm.

01:31:11.560 --> 01:31:12.629
Malcolm.

01:31:13.305 --> 01:31:19.909
