09:00.581 --> 09:02.041
What's all this?

09:02.041 --> 09:05.378
I have an audition.

09:05.962 --> 09:09.006
Can you believe it?
They're making me read.

09:09.006 --> 09:11.676
I thought actors just sent video now.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.887
If they're gonna make me read,

09:15.429 --> 09:20.476
they are getting the full experience,
whether they like it or not.

09:21.811 --> 09:24.897
That reminds me. You have a driver, yes?

09:24.897 --> 09:26.440
Yes. I have a driver.

09:26.440 --> 09:28.526
Good, I need to borrow her.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.320
She's not a taxi, Mama.
She takes me to court.

09:31.320 --> 09:36.409
So she can take you to court
and then take me to my audition.

09:37.785 --> 09:39.161
Where is this audition?

09:42.164 --> 09:45.501
The courthouse is downtown.
That's hours away in traffic.

09:45.501 --> 09:48.379
It won't work. I'll get you an Uber.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.393
Did I say I wanted to go?

22:24.760 --> 22:27.554
What happened?

22:27.554 --> 22:29.264
Time, son.

22:30.474 --> 22:31.433
I was dropped.

22:32.976 --> 22:34.436
My agent dropped me.

22:35.228 --> 22:36.146
Me.

22:36.813 --> 22:38.273
I was a star.

22:39.816 --> 22:42.361
Now I'm begging for scraps.

22:48.033 --> 22:51.703
Maybe this is a sign.

22:52.913 --> 22:58.168
The universe is telling me
it's time for something else.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.590
Time to focus on my family, maybe.

23:09.221 --> 23:13.517
I think sometimes the universe
likes to knock you around a little bit

23:14.726 --> 23:17.396
to remind you that you have to fight back.

23:20.148 --> 23:23.360
Mama. Why don't you
come to court tomorrow?

23:24.111 --> 23:27.489
You don't really want me there.

23:27.489 --> 23:30.450
I do. I'm asking you to come.
I could use the support.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.286
Really?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.998
Okay. If you really need me...

23:38.625 --> 23:39.459
I'll come.

23:41.211 --> 23:42.671
I can do that for you.

23:48.969 --> 23:51.221
I think I'll even wear my new sweater.

47:25.133 --> 47:27.469
Come in. Thanks.
