01:08.400 --> 01:11.500
THE PAINTED VEIL

02:17.600 --> 02:21.300
CHINA 1925

04:06.500 --> 04:09.400
LONDON TWO YEARS EARLIER

05:09.000 --> 05:10.000
Hello.

05:11.500 --> 05:12.700
Say, I was wondering...

05:14.600 --> 05:15.300
What?

05:15.700 --> 05:17.900
Sorry. I was wondering if
you'd like to dance?

05:21.300 --> 05:22.000
Why not?

05:32.200 --> 05:35.900
Kitty, who was the young man you were
dancing with last night?

05:36.200 --> 05:37.200
Which one?

05:37.800 --> 05:39.800
The quiet, serious-looking one.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.100
Oh, him.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.000
I suppose you invited him, Mother.

05:44.900 --> 05:46.100
I don't know who you're talking about.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.500
I invited him.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.800
His name is Fane and he's a doctor.

05:52.500 --> 05:55.600
He manages a government laboratory
in Shanghai.

05:55.900 --> 05:56.900
A civil servant?

05:57.500 --> 05:58.300
In any case.

05:58.500 --> 06:01.400
He called 'round last Sunday,
we had a long chat.

06:01.500 --> 06:03.000
I told him to come back anytime.

06:03.300 --> 06:05.600
It's not often that you like
any of my young men.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.300
Well, do you like him?

06:07.900 --> 06:08.700
Not really.

06:08.800 --> 06:11.100
- What's wrong with him?
- Is he in love with you?

06:11.300 --> 06:12.400
I don't know.

06:12.500 --> 06:14.400
I should have thought by now
you'd know when a

06:14.500 --> 06:15.800
young man was in love with you.

06:15.900 --> 06:18.300
The point is whether or not I'm in love
with him. And I'm not.

06:18.900 --> 06:20.000
You'd better be careful, young lady.

06:20.200 --> 06:22.000
Time can run out, you know.

06:22.100 --> 06:24.900
Oh, stop it, Mother. Honestly.

06:25.100 --> 06:26.700
The very idea that a woman
should marry

06:26.800 --> 06:28.100
any Tom, Dick, or Harry...

06:28.900 --> 06:32.200
...regardless of her own feelings is
simply prehistoric.

06:32.700 --> 06:35.500
How much longer do you expect your
father to go on supporting you?

06:54.500 --> 06:55.500
Oh.

06:56.900 --> 06:57.500
Hello.

06:57.600 --> 06:58.900
Hello. I...

06:59.500 --> 07:00.700
I was just coming...

07:05.100 --> 07:06.400
Your father invited me.

07:08.200 --> 07:09.100
I'm going out.

07:09.900 --> 07:11.000
May I join you?

07:29.500 --> 07:30.700
Right on time.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.700
What is it exactly that you do?

07:52.000 --> 07:53.400
I'm a bacteriologist.

07:54.900 --> 07:55.900
That must be fascinating.

07:57.500 --> 07:58.900
You have no idea what that is, do you?

07:59.900 --> 08:01.400
No. I'm afraid not.

08:01.700 --> 08:03.000
No, there's no reason you should.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.500
I study the microorganisms
that carry disease.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.100
Charming.

08:07.600 --> 08:09.800
No, it's not actually. It's the opposite.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.400
Shall we step inside?

08:30.700 --> 08:31.600
Do you like flowers?

08:32.900 --> 08:34.400
Not particularly, no.

08:35.400 --> 08:36.400
Well, I mean, yes.

08:36.500 --> 08:39.700
But we don't really have
them around the house.

08:40.500 --> 08:40.900
Mother says,

08:41.000 --> 08:43.500
"Why purchase something you can
grow for free?"

08:44.500 --> 08:46.100
But then we don't really grow them
either.

08:47.600 --> 08:49.200
It does seem silly, really.

08:49.500 --> 08:52.000
To put all that effort into something
that's just going to die.

08:54.500 --> 08:55.900
I'd like to say something to you.

08:58.600 --> 09:00.600
I came to see you to ask you
if you'll marry me.

09:03.100 --> 09:05.000
You could knock me down
with a feather.

09:05.700 --> 09:07.600
Could you not tell that I'm in love
with you?

09:08.400 --> 09:09.600
You never showed it.

09:09.900 --> 09:11.200
Oh, I'd...

09:12.300 --> 09:15.400
Well, I wanted to. It's difficult. I...

09:17.800 --> 09:19.000
But there it is.

09:19.400 --> 09:20.200
Right.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.100
I'm not sure that's very well put.

09:23.500 --> 09:24.400
No, it's not.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.100
Do you see how clumsy I am? I...

09:27.500 --> 09:28.700
I'm terrible at these sorts of things.

09:28.800 --> 09:29.600
But the thing is

09:29.700 --> 09:31.200
I've got to get back to China very soon.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.300
I don't have time to be cautious.

09:34.500 --> 09:36.300
I've never thought of you in that way.

09:36.400 --> 09:38.000
I think I improve greatly
upon acquaintance.

09:38.100 --> 09:39.100
Oh, I'm sure you do...

09:39.200 --> 09:42.200
I'd do anything in my power to
make you happy.

09:44.200 --> 09:45.100
Anything at all.

09:49.900 --> 09:51.100
I think you'd like Shanghai.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.200
It's quite exciting, it is.

09:55.500 --> 09:56.500
Lots of dancing.

09:57.300 --> 10:00.400
Surely you're not expecting me to
answer this second?

10:06.300 --> 10:08.000
I don't know you at all.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.900
Yes! Well,
we had the highest of hopes, but...

10:13.300 --> 10:16.700
...no expectation that he'd ask her
so soon.

10:17.300 --> 10:20.900
Yes. A lovely late autumn wedding.

10:21.500 --> 10:24.400
She's done very well for her herself,
has my Doris.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.000
At least one of them's made a success.

10:28.400 --> 10:30.900
No, I gave up on Kitty ages ago.

10:31.500 --> 10:32.000
Yes.

10:32.900 --> 10:33.500
Yes.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.700
Well, I know you understand. Yes.

11:20.600 --> 11:21.300
Well?

11:23.400 --> 11:25.200
Is it smaller than you imagined?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.300
I'm not sure what I imagined.

11:30.000 --> 11:31.100
Don't you have a piano?

11:33.600 --> 11:35.800
No, I don't play the piano.

11:44.800 --> 11:45.800
Who is it?

11:46.000 --> 11:47.100
It's I.

11:52.400 --> 11:53.200
Come in.

12:04.400 --> 12:05.800
Just wanted to see

12:07.700 --> 12:10.200
So, then, you're comfortable, then?

12:10.600 --> 12:11.900
Do you need anything?

12:12.700 --> 12:13.400
No.

12:14.200 --> 12:15.000
I'm fine.

12:15.300 --> 12:15.900
Thank you.

12:16.200 --> 12:18.100
Good. Good.

12:43.100 --> 12:45.000
I'm so happy you're here.

13:11.200 --> 13:12.300
Shall I shut the lamp?

13:12.900 --> 13:13.800
What for?

13:19.700 --> 13:21.000
I'll shut the lamp.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.400
It's raining cats and dogs.

13:50.900 --> 13:53.000
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.

13:53.100 --> 13:54.100
Yes, I heard you.

13:55.500 --> 13:56.900
You might have answered.

13:57.400 --> 13:58.100
I'm sorry.

13:59.900 --> 14:00.800
I've gotten used to not speaking...

14:00.900 --> 14:02.300
...unless I have something to say.

14:02.700 --> 14:05.400
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...

14:05.900 --> 14:08.400
...the human race would soon
lose the power of speech.

14:16.400 --> 14:17.200
Walter.

14:21.400 --> 14:22.200
I'm sorry.

14:24.500 --> 14:25.100
You're right.

14:29.300 --> 14:31.000
What shall we do? Shall we...

14:32.100 --> 14:33.600
...shall we play a game?

14:33.900 --> 14:36.100
You don't like the games I play.
They bore you.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.000
Nonsense.

14:38.300 --> 14:39.200
Let's play cards.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.600
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?

14:53.700 --> 14:56.000
We have an invitation for
Saturday night.

14:56.100 --> 14:56.800
From whom?

14:57.300 --> 14:58.300
The Townsends.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.600
Dorothy Townsend.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.400
Do you not like her?

15:04.900 --> 15:06.300
Well, I've only met her once,

15:06.800 --> 15:08.600
but there's no reason for her
to put on such airs.

15:08.700 --> 15:09.300
Does she?

15:09.500 --> 15:11.500
Yes. I have no idea why.

15:11.900 --> 15:14.200
She was what?
Married to a vice consul?

15:15.600 --> 15:18.300
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.500
Mother wouldn't dream of asking
half of them to dinner.

15:21.100 --> 15:22.800
I'm taking that black five.

15:26.500 --> 15:28.200
Well, it's all right.

15:28.700 --> 15:30.000
I thought you might enjoy it,

15:31.300 --> 15:32.800
but we certainly don't have to go.

15:34.200 --> 15:35.400
I don't care either way.

15:40.100 --> 15:41.000
Go where?

15:51.900 --> 15:53.300
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.

15:53.500 --> 15:54.500
I'm so glad you could come.

15:55.200 --> 15:56.100
This is Walter.

15:56.300 --> 15:57.400
I'm pleased to meet you.

15:57.800 --> 15:58.400
This is my husband.

15:59.100 --> 16:01.100
Charlie, stop talking and
greet our guests.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.600
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.

16:03.700 --> 16:05.300
It's Dr. Fane, darling.

16:05.600 --> 16:07.800
Oh, dear. I do beg your pardon,
Dr. Fane.

16:08.000 --> 16:08.800
Not at all.

16:09.100 --> 16:10.700
And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.

16:11.200 --> 16:12.000
Mrs. Fane.

16:12.400 --> 16:13.100
Mr. Townsend.

16:13.400 --> 16:15.000
I do apologize, Dr. Fane.

16:15.200 --> 16:16.800
I assumed you worked with Charlie
at the consulate.

16:16.900 --> 16:18.200
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.

16:18.300 --> 16:19.500
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.

16:21.100 --> 16:23.700
The government lab? How fascinating.

16:52.100 --> 16:53.200
Are you enjoying it?

16:54.100 --> 16:55.400
I've never seen anything like it.

17:01.300 --> 17:02.800
Every gesture has a meaning.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.300
See how she covers her face
with the cloth?

17:05.900 --> 17:07.800
She is mourning her misfortune.

17:09.500 --> 17:10.900
What happened to her?

17:15.300 --> 17:17.400
She was sold into slavery.

17:18.599 --> 17:21.500
Condemned to a life of drudgery
and despair...

17:22.500 --> 17:24.700
...in a strange land far from home.

17:26.500 --> 17:27.400
See the chains?

17:28.900 --> 17:31.600
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...

17:31.700 --> 17:33.400
...from which there is no escape.

17:36.200 --> 17:37.600
And so she weeps.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.100
She weeps for the lively,

17:40.300 --> 17:42.200
vivacious girl she once was...

17:45.300 --> 17:47.100
...for the lonely woman she has become.

17:50.100 --> 17:51.500
And most of all...

17:52.500 --> 17:55.000
...she weeps for the love
she'll never feel...

17:56.900 --> 17:59.300
...for the love she'll never give.

18:02.700 --> 18:04.100
Is that really what she's saying?

18:06.500 --> 18:08.600
Actually, I haven't a clue what
she's on about.

18:09.000 --> 18:10.200
I don't speak Chinese.

19:35.300 --> 19:36.100
What was that?

19:40.100 --> 19:41.400
Perhaps it was the amah,
or one of the...

19:54.500 --> 19:55.200
They've gone.

20:00.400 --> 20:01.300
He heard us.

20:01.700 --> 20:02.200
Who?

20:02.900 --> 20:03.900
Walter.

20:05.600 --> 20:07.400
Walter. What if it was?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.200
For all he knows you were taking a nap.

20:10.300 --> 20:11.200
With my doors locked?

20:11.500 --> 20:14.200
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.

20:19.900 --> 20:22.000
Even if it was,
my impression is he'll do nothing.

20:22.900 --> 20:24.300
That's flattering.

20:24.500 --> 20:25.400
He knows as well as anyone...

20:25.500 --> 20:27.200
...there's nothing to be gained by
making a scandal.

20:28.400 --> 20:31.600
Has it occurred to you that my husband
is in love with me?

20:37.900 --> 20:40.400
I have a feeling you're about to say
something awful.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.000
It's just that women are often under
the impression that...

20:45.100 --> 20:47.700
...men are much more in love with them
than they really are.

20:48.900 --> 20:52.000
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.

20:55.300 --> 20:56.400
Now there you're wrong.

21:07.700 --> 21:08.800
Do you like your present?

21:10.900 --> 21:12.100
It's good enough.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.300
Charlie?

21:28.200 --> 21:30.800
Do I make you as happy as
you make me?

21:32.300 --> 21:33.900
Of course you do, darling.

22:05.300 --> 22:07.900
(Miss you Father)

22:09.100 --> 22:10.500
- Hassan?
- Yes?

22:11.500 --> 22:14.200
- Who brought this package 'round?
- Dr. Fane.

22:16.900 --> 22:17.700
When?

22:17.900 --> 22:19.400
While you sleeping.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.500
It's nearly midday.

23:24.100 --> 23:25.900
We could stop up here under the trees...

23:26.600 --> 23:28.400
...but I'd like to press on if
it's all right with you.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.200
Certainly, my comfort's of no concern
to you.

23:32.900 --> 23:34.300
Right. Then we'll continue.

23:44.200 --> 23:45.500
Charlie Townsend, please.

23:47.800 --> 23:48.600
Charles Townsend.

23:49.300 --> 23:50.200
I need to see you.

23:51.000 --> 23:52.200
Kitty, I can't possibly see you.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.000
I've got a meeting in an hour at the club.

23:54.700 --> 23:55.600
What is it?

23:56.500 --> 23:57.400
I have to go.

24:01.100 --> 24:02.000
What are you doing home?

24:02.800 --> 24:05.200
I'm sorry. There's something I need
to speak with you about.

24:06.300 --> 24:08.100
Actually, I was just about to
take my bath.

24:08.500 --> 24:11.700
I'm afraid it's rather important, darling.
Can't wait.

24:24.300 --> 24:24.900
Sit down.

24:31.600 --> 24:33.100
Do you know a place called
Mei-Tan-Fu?

24:33.900 --> 24:34.700
No.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.900
Well, it was in the papers the other day.

24:38.900 --> 24:40.800
It's a small town on a tributary
of the Yangtze River,

24:41.800 --> 24:42.700
in the interior.

24:44.300 --> 24:46.100
They've had an outbreak of
cholera there.

24:46.500 --> 24:48.800
It's the worst epidemic anyone's seen
in a long time.

24:49.500 --> 24:51.200
The Chinese medical officer has died.

24:52.000 --> 24:54.900
There's a convent of French nuns and
they're trying to run the hospital...

24:55.000 --> 24:55.800
...and they're doing the best
that they can,

24:55.900 --> 24:57.200
but people are dropping like flies.

24:59.300 --> 25:02.600
I have volunteered to go and
to take charge.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.700
Why?

25:04.900 --> 25:05.800
Because they need a doctor.

25:06.300 --> 25:08.200
But you're not a doctor.
You're a bacteriologist.

25:08.700 --> 25:09.500
I'm an M.D.

25:10.100 --> 25:11.700
The fact that I'm foremost a scientist...

25:11.800 --> 25:13.400
...is actually all to the good in this case.

25:16.900 --> 25:18.400
Won't it be awfully dangerous?

25:20.100 --> 25:22.300
I suppose it might, yes.

25:24.200 --> 25:26.200
Now, Mei-Tan-Fu is a ten-day journey.

25:26.700 --> 25:29.800
You can go by rail for the first part of it,
but after that it's carriage...

25:29.900 --> 25:31.300
...and then we'll have to take a
sedan chair.

25:33.100 --> 25:34.300
Who's we?

25:34.900 --> 25:36.000
Why, you and I, of course.

25:36.300 --> 25:38.200
You're not expecting me to come too?

25:38.400 --> 25:40.500
I hoped that if I was going
you would want to go.

25:40.700 --> 25:42.300
Surely it's no place for a woman.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.100
It would be madness for me to go.
Why should I?

25:47.200 --> 25:48.700
To cheer and comfort me?

25:49.200 --> 25:50.100
No.

25:51.100 --> 25:52.300
No, I won't go.

25:52.500 --> 25:54.300
In fact, it's monstrous of you
to even ask me.

25:54.500 --> 25:57.100
Fine. Then I shall file my petition
for divorce tomorrow.

26:07.000 --> 26:09.300
I'm afraid that you have thought me
a bigger fool than I am.

26:10.900 --> 26:12.200
I don't know what you're talking about.

26:12.500 --> 26:13.600
Don't you?

26:14.500 --> 26:16.100
I am divorcing you for adultery.

26:17.700 --> 26:19.700
I am naming Charles Townsend
as your lover.

26:32.000 --> 26:33.200
I'm sorry, Walter.

26:33.600 --> 26:35.800
I realize this is very unpleasant, but,

26:35.900 --> 26:37.900
please, let's not make this uglier
than it needs to be.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.800
By all means. What is it that you
propose that we should do?

26:43.700 --> 26:45.800
You could let me divorce you quietly.

26:45.900 --> 26:46.800
You divorce me?

26:48.200 --> 26:50.900
- On what grounds, may I ask?
- That's what a gentleman would do.

26:51.000 --> 26:51.700
Can you give me one reason I should...

26:51.800 --> 26:54.400
...put myself to the smallest
inconvenience on your account?

26:54.500 --> 26:56.200
Please, Walter, don't be so hateful.

26:57.100 --> 26:59.800
We didn't mean to hurt anyone. But...

27:00.800 --> 27:02.500
...Charlie and I have fallen in love.

27:04.900 --> 27:05.900
He wants to marry me.

27:06.500 --> 27:07.200
Really?

27:07.900 --> 27:09.700
I knew that you weren't the cleverest girl
in the world...

27:10.300 --> 27:12.000
...but I didn't know that you were
actually a fool.

27:12.300 --> 27:14.700
Yes. Well, if it makes you feel better
to hurt me,

27:14.800 --> 27:15.700
then go ahead.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.100
But you might as well get used to it.

27:17.900 --> 27:18.700
We love each other.

27:19.400 --> 27:20.800
And we're sick to death of the secrecy...

27:20.900 --> 27:22.200
...and compromise and all the rest of it.

27:22.400 --> 27:24.200
And now you curse the day
that you ever met me.

27:24.300 --> 27:25.700
Stop mocking me.

27:25.800 --> 27:26.600
There's no other response...

27:26.700 --> 27:27.900
...for such pathetic behavior!

27:29.400 --> 27:30.100
It's comic.

27:30.800 --> 27:33.200
When I think about how hard I've tried
to make you happy.

27:33.900 --> 27:34.500
Debasing myself!

27:34.600 --> 27:36.800
Acting as though I was as thrilled
as you...

27:36.900 --> 27:38.200
...by the latest gossip
and as vulgar and as ignorant...

27:38.300 --> 27:40.200
- ...of the world as you are!
- Shut up!

27:41.500 --> 27:44.400
If you interrupt me again,
I'll strangle you.

27:44.500 --> 27:45.100
Sit down.

27:48.100 --> 27:50.200
I knew when I married you that

27:50.300 --> 27:51.600
you were selfish and spoiled.

27:53.500 --> 27:54.400
But I loved you.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.400
I knew that you married me...

27:57.500 --> 27:59.800
...only to get as far away from
your mother as possible...

28:00.800 --> 28:02.200
...and I hoped that one day...

28:03.300 --> 28:04.600
...there'd be something more.

28:07.200 --> 28:08.000
I was wrong.

28:10.100 --> 28:11.100
You don't have it in you.

28:12.300 --> 28:15.000
If a man hasn't what's necessary
to make a woman love him,

28:15.100 --> 28:16.000
then it's his fault...

28:16.700 --> 28:17.500
...not hers.

28:18.600 --> 28:19.400
Either way.

28:21.300 --> 28:23.300
Tomorrow morning we are to leave for
Mei-Tan-Fu,

28:24.500 --> 28:25.500
or I shall file my petition.

28:25.700 --> 28:27.400
Walter, you can't be serious about
taking me...

28:27.500 --> 28:29.100
...into the middle of a cholera epidemic.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
Do you think that I'm not?

28:33.600 --> 28:34.700
My God.

28:36.800 --> 28:38.300
That's what you want, isn't it?

28:40.400 --> 28:42.500
Do you really think Charlie
will let you do this?

28:42.700 --> 28:44.200
I don't think Charlie has very much
to say about it.

28:47.300 --> 28:48.600
Everything you said is true.

28:51.300 --> 28:52.500
Everything.

28:54.000 --> 28:55.800
I married you even though
I didn't love you.

28:56.500 --> 28:57.300
But you knew that.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.800
Aren't you as much to blame for
what's happened as I?

29:16.800 --> 29:17.500
All right.

29:19.300 --> 29:20.300
Here's what I'll do.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.300
Gentlemen, we all have assets
to protect here.

29:25.400 --> 29:27.400
Unfortunately, Mr. Nagata's actions...

29:27.500 --> 29:29.400
...have created a rather urgent situation.

29:29.500 --> 29:31.200
It was an unfortunate,

29:31.300 --> 29:33.400
but unavoidable incident.

29:33.500 --> 29:34.900
Your foreman shot a worker.

29:35.100 --> 29:35.900
He was an agitator.

29:36.300 --> 29:37.200
He was a Chinese.

29:39.500 --> 29:41.100
You may have suppressed a
very small strike...

29:41.900 --> 29:43.400
...but in doing so you have started...

29:43.500 --> 29:45.100
...a very large demonstration.

30:03.700 --> 30:05.200
I need to use your pen, please.

30:05.500 --> 30:06.400
Here you are, miss.

30:10.900 --> 30:12.600
What about support from
Chiang Kai-shek?

30:12.900 --> 30:13.800
Where does he stand on this?

30:13.900 --> 30:17.100
He's a Nationalist. He will stand
on the side of the Chinese.

30:17.300 --> 30:19.300
That's why they call themselves
Nationalists.

30:19.600 --> 30:20.800
Excuse me.

30:21.900 --> 30:22.800
Mr. Townsend.

30:27.300 --> 30:29.400
I think you underestimated the situation.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.400
I have three of my mills shut down
because of walk-outs.

30:32.900 --> 30:34.100
There is talk about boycotts.

30:34.300 --> 30:35.200
So, what do you propose?

30:35.500 --> 30:38.200
A handful of municipal soldiers is
hardly a show of force.

30:38.300 --> 30:39.200
If you'll excuse me.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.800
Mrs. Fane. What a pleasant surprise.

30:47.800 --> 30:49.400
You've rescued me from
a pack of wild bores.

30:49.900 --> 30:51.500
I wouldn't have come if
it wasn't necessary.

30:56.700 --> 30:57.800
Are you all right?

30:59.100 --> 31:01.200
I needed to see you. I'm sorry.

31:01.400 --> 31:03.500
Kitty, this is not the most opportune
time for me to...

31:03.600 --> 31:07.100
He knows.

31:07.700 --> 31:08.700
Right.

31:18.500 --> 31:19.800
After you, Mrs. Fane.

31:21.900 --> 31:22.400
Hello, Charlie.

31:22.500 --> 31:23.500
Hello, George.

31:27.700 --> 31:28.800
Hello, Townsend.

31:28.900 --> 31:29.700
Adam.

31:37.300 --> 31:38.200
He wants a divorce.

31:42.300 --> 31:43.800
You didn't commit yourself, did you?

31:44.900 --> 31:45.800
Acknowledge anything?

31:46.600 --> 31:47.400
No.

31:47.800 --> 31:48.900
Are you sure?

31:49.100 --> 31:49.900
Quite sure.

31:53.500 --> 31:54.400
Well.

31:56.000 --> 31:57.900
This is a bloody scrape we're in.

31:59.500 --> 32:00.900
He says he has proof.

32:01.400 --> 32:02.200
We deny it.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.400
He can't prove anything.

32:04.500 --> 32:07.400
Besides, it wouldn't do Walter
any good to create a scandal.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.200
But there isn't going to be a scandal.

32:09.700 --> 32:11.800
Walter's agreed to let me
divorce him quietly.

32:18.900 --> 32:21.000
That's not so terrible, is it?

32:24.100 --> 32:24.700
Will you hold me?

32:25.100 --> 32:26.100
Of course I will.

32:29.600 --> 32:31.000
Oh, God.

32:33.600 --> 32:34.500
Charlie?

32:36.400 --> 32:38.400
His offer comes with a condition.

32:44.100 --> 32:44.900
I'm not a rich man.

32:45.800 --> 32:47.000
He doesn't want your money.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.100
He's agreed to let me divorce him...

32:49.300 --> 32:51.800
...if Dorothy will agree to divorce you.

32:52.300 --> 32:54.200
And if...

32:55.400 --> 32:56.500
What?

32:57.600 --> 32:59.800
If you'll promise to marry me.

33:06.600 --> 33:08.900
You know, darling, whatever happens,

33:09.000 --> 33:10.500
we must try to keep Dorothy out of it.

33:12.300 --> 33:13.400
What do you mean?

33:15.000 --> 33:17.200
We can't only think of ourselves.

33:17.900 --> 33:18.900
I know Dorothy.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.200
Nothing in the world will induce her
to divorce me.

33:23.900 --> 33:25.300
You don't want to divorce her.

33:25.900 --> 33:27.900
It's not just a question of my marriage...

33:28.000 --> 33:28.800
Then what is it?

33:28.900 --> 33:31.000
Do you have any idea of the importance
of my station here?

33:31.100 --> 33:31.900
If I were...

33:33.500 --> 33:34.700
Why are you laughing?

33:41.800 --> 33:44.700
I don't think Walter intended for
one minute to divorce me.

33:45.800 --> 33:46.800
He knew you'd let me down.

33:47.900 --> 33:48.800
Try to understand.

33:48.900 --> 33:50.300
I understand, all right.

33:50.400 --> 33:52.300
Kitty! Kitty, please.

33:52.400 --> 33:53.800
We'll work this out, I promise. D...

34:15.800 --> 34:16.800
I'm coming with you.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.000
Good. I thought you might.

34:23.300 --> 34:25.400
I suppose I needn't take more than
a few summer things?

34:25.900 --> 34:26.699
And a shroud?

34:27.000 --> 34:28.000
I've told Hassan what you will need.

34:28.100 --> 34:29.100
She's packing already.

36:29.400 --> 36:30.900
I wouldn't touch that if I was you.

36:32.800 --> 36:34.000
They may have died in that bed.

36:36.200 --> 36:37.300
This can be your room.

36:56.500 --> 36:57.600
You must be the doctor's wife.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.700
I've just met your husband...

37:00.800 --> 37:02.000
...and invited myself to dinner.

37:03.500 --> 37:04.900
I've kept the Watsons' cook for you.

37:05.000 --> 37:05.800
She's not bad.

37:06.000 --> 37:07.700
She'll have to do as your amah as well.

37:08.300 --> 37:09.700
We're a little short-handed here.

37:10.900 --> 37:12.900
Sorry, my name is Waddington.

37:13.400 --> 37:15.600
Oh, yes, of course. Kitty Fane.

37:16.200 --> 37:17.300
I'm the Deputy Commissioner.

37:17.400 --> 37:18.000
Please.

37:19.400 --> 37:22.200
I believe you're one of our neighbors.

37:22.700 --> 37:24.100
Only neighbor, I'm afraid.

37:24.500 --> 37:25.500
Last one standing.

37:26.600 --> 37:28.600
And Watson was the missionary
living here?

37:29.400 --> 37:30.600
Yes. Nice fellow.

37:31.200 --> 37:32.700
American. Lovely family.

37:34.100 --> 37:35.900
I'll show you their graves tomorrow,
if you like.

37:37.700 --> 37:38.800
How kind of you.

37:39.500 --> 37:41.400
I hope your journey wasn't too arduous?

37:41.600 --> 37:44.400
We've been traveling for two weeks.

37:44.700 --> 37:47.400
Two weeks? What did you do, swim?

37:47.500 --> 37:49.900
No, we didn't come up river.
Came overland.

37:50.700 --> 37:51.800
Whatever for?

37:52.300 --> 37:54.400
Well, we wanted to take in a bit
of the countryside.

37:55.700 --> 37:57.100
Get a bit of sun. Didn't we, darling?

38:04.200 --> 38:05.300
Anyone for a cocktail?

38:06.900 --> 38:07.600
Here's luck.

38:12.500 --> 38:14.800
I was told I might get some help from
the local army officer.

38:15.500 --> 38:16.800
Colonel Yu, is it?

38:18.000 --> 38:20.700
Good luck with him. He's not fond
of us British.

38:22.100 --> 38:24.100
Listen, I'll warn you,

38:24.800 --> 38:26.800
things are pretty dicey even out here.

38:27.300 --> 38:29.200
I'm afraid that if the cholera
doesn't get us,

38:29.300 --> 38:30.200
the Nationalists might.

38:31.900 --> 38:32.900
Tried to get those nuns to go,

38:33.000 --> 38:34.100
but they refused.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.800
They all want to be martyrs,
damn them.

38:36.900 --> 38:37.900
And why have you stayed?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.200
I was posted here. Simple as that.

38:43.500 --> 38:46.000
I was shocked to hear you'd volunteered.

38:46.600 --> 38:49.600
Opportunity for research.
I couldn't pass it up.

38:50.800 --> 38:52.200
Yes. And you?

38:53.600 --> 38:56.600
I don't suppose you've come to
Mei-Tan-Fu for the research.

38:56.700 --> 38:57.800
My husband's the scientist.

38:59.100 --> 38:59.600
Indeed.

39:00.700 --> 39:02.400
Did you have any reaction to the
inoculation?

39:04.500 --> 39:05.800
You have been inoculated?

39:06.500 --> 39:07.600
Yes, of course.

39:09.200 --> 39:09.800
No guarantee.

39:09.900 --> 39:12.600
The Watsons were inoculated,
it didn't do them much good.

39:14.700 --> 39:16.600
Have you brought any gramophone
records?

39:17.900 --> 39:19.800
No, unfortunately not.

39:20.600 --> 39:23.100
Pity. I'm sick of all mine.

39:28.500 --> 39:29.400
Listen.

39:30.100 --> 39:30.800
What's all that?

39:32.700 --> 39:33.300
Across the river.

39:34.100 --> 39:36.400
Trying to frighten off the spirit of death.

39:44.300 --> 39:46.000
I'm going to town in the morning.
Have a look around.

39:47.300 --> 39:48.700
I expect you'll want to rest.

39:48.900 --> 39:50.500
I can inoculate you in the evening.

39:51.200 --> 39:52.800
Will you be doing yourself?

39:53.200 --> 39:54.200
No, I don't think so.

39:55.500 --> 39:56.500
You needn't bother with me then.

39:56.700 --> 39:57.600
Suit yourself.

39:59.500 --> 40:00.400
Tell me, Walter.

40:03.300 --> 40:04.800
Is it a long, drawn-out affair,

40:04.900 --> 40:05.900
dying of cholera?

40:06.000 --> 40:07.200
No. All of the fluid goes out of you...

40:07.300 --> 40:08.800
...in the first 36 hours.

40:09.100 --> 40:10.700
You die of dehydration, actually.

40:11.500 --> 40:13.400
So, it's messy and very painful.

40:14.800 --> 40:15.700
But it is relatively quick.

40:18.500 --> 40:19.200
Good night.

40:46.500 --> 40:47.800
It's rather unfortunate.

40:49.100 --> 40:50.200
I thought perhaps that you and
your wife...

40:50.400 --> 40:54.000
...you'd like to take precautions in case
you have to leave this place.

40:54.200 --> 40:56.000
Do you think all this is really necessary?

40:56.100 --> 40:57.100
You can see the picture.

40:57.900 --> 41:01.800
I thought you'd like to put
your wife's mind...

41:01.900 --> 41:04.200
...at rest from this situation.

41:06.500 --> 41:08.800
This is Colonel Yu.
He's the KMT's man.

41:09.500 --> 41:11.900
He's posting one of his men here
at the house.

41:12.800 --> 41:13.600
Am I a prisoner?

41:13.900 --> 41:16.100
No. It was Mr. Waddington's
idea actually.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.400
He feels we should take precautions.

41:18.900 --> 41:19.900
Precautions against what?

41:22.000 --> 41:24.500
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...

41:24.600 --> 41:27.900
...on a group of Chinese workers who
were demonstrating in Shanghai.

41:28.600 --> 41:29.800
Eleven were killed.

41:31.100 --> 41:32.400
We've only just heard.

41:32.900 --> 41:34.800
Those were plastered around
the town last night.

41:34.900 --> 41:36.800
(Death to foreign murderers!)

41:38.100 --> 41:39.100
I shouldn't worry too much.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.800
Even the Nationalists are afraid
of cholera.

42:40.300 --> 42:41.400
Do they take that water from the well?

42:43.100 --> 42:44.800
Colonel, can I see where they get
their drinking water?

42:45.000 --> 42:45.900
(Imperialist pig!)

43:00.900 --> 43:02.200
For starters,
we've got to stop people from...

43:02.400 --> 43:04.100
...using this well until I can test it.

43:11.600 --> 43:12.500
Do you understand?

43:13.600 --> 43:15.400
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.

43:16.200 --> 43:18.700
I received my military training
in Moscow.

43:19.500 --> 43:20.800
If you don't like English,

43:20.900 --> 43:22.000
we can speak Russian.

43:23.300 --> 43:24.700
English will be fine. Thank you.

43:40.500 --> 43:41.300
Here.

43:42.100 --> 43:44.100
You have seen cholera before,
yes, Doctor?

43:44.200 --> 43:45.400
At the laboratory, of course.

43:45.500 --> 43:46.900
No, I mean in a patient.

43:47.200 --> 43:49.000
No. No, I haven't had the chance

43:53.800 --> 43:55.100
Well, I'm not a clinician.

43:55.500 --> 43:56.600
Did they not tell you?

43:56.900 --> 43:58.100
I'm an infectious disease specialist.

44:02.300 --> 44:02.800
Shall we?

44:03.100 --> 44:05.100
After you, Doctor.

45:10.100 --> 45:11.500
(Charlie)

45:14.000 --> 45:20.000
(without you it is intolerable)

45:29.900 --> 45:30.900
I don't need you.

45:34.000 --> 45:34.800
Go back!

45:43.700 --> 45:44.500
Mr. Waddington?

45:49.700 --> 45:51.100
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.

46:04.900 --> 46:08.200
Wait here. All right?

46:14.200 --> 46:15.000
Hello?

46:15.800 --> 46:16.900
Mr. Waddington?

46:27.500 --> 46:28.100
Mrs. Fane?

46:30.000 --> 46:30.600
Good morning.

46:36.500 --> 46:37.800
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?

46:38.500 --> 46:40.400
I found a record for you.

46:43.100 --> 46:44.100
Stravinsky.

46:44.900 --> 46:46.600
Very modern. Thank you.

46:49.900 --> 46:50.800
Was there something else?

46:52.700 --> 46:54.600
I was wondering if you could tell me...

46:54.700 --> 46:55.900
...when the post comes through.

46:56.000 --> 46:57.000
It's for Shanghai.

46:57.400 --> 46:58.900
Unfortunately, since the cholera,

46:59.000 --> 47:01.000
the cowards won't venture
past the river port...

47:01.100 --> 47:02.800
...but leave it with me.

47:03.600 --> 47:05.700
A local trader I know is making the trip
on Friday.

47:07.500 --> 47:08.500
Townsend.

47:09.600 --> 47:10.400
Charlie Townsend?

47:10.600 --> 47:12.800
Yes. He's an acquaintance
of my husband.

47:14.200 --> 47:15.400
Do you know him?

47:15.700 --> 47:18.800
Years ago. We were both assigned
to the consulate in Shanghai.

47:20.300 --> 47:21.400
Charming wife?

47:22.300 --> 47:23.900
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?

47:24.300 --> 47:26.100
He'd made a science of popularity.

47:27.000 --> 47:28.300
So, you know his family?

47:28.500 --> 47:30.700
Well, well enough. I like Dorothy.

47:31.900 --> 47:34.400
Yes, I understand they're quite
the devoted couple.

47:35.600 --> 47:37.100
Oh, he had his little flirtations.

47:38.800 --> 47:39.900
Nothing serious.

47:41.700 --> 47:44.200
I once heard her say that she found it
most unflattering...

47:44.300 --> 47:45.800
...that the women who fell
for her husband...

47:45.900 --> 47:48.100
...were so consistently second-rate.

47:54.600 --> 47:57.400
Well, enjoy the record.

47:59.100 --> 47:59.900
Mrs. Fane?

48:02.200 --> 48:03.200
The letter.

48:04.900 --> 48:05.800
Right.

48:06.500 --> 48:09.100
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me that
Friday's much too late.

48:10.000 --> 48:11.100
Thanks all the same.

48:37.300 --> 48:38.700
Can you pass the salt, please?

48:43.400 --> 48:44.400
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

48:45.500 --> 48:46.800
Could you pass the salt?

48:52.200 --> 48:52.800
Thank you.

49:09.300 --> 49:10.600
So, this is how it's going to be?

49:12.700 --> 49:15.400
Passing her evenings in silence.

49:22.000 --> 49:22.800
Walter.

49:25.800 --> 49:26.600
Walter!

49:28.400 --> 49:30.400
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.

49:38.900 --> 49:40.200
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.

49:41.700 --> 49:42.500
Leave it.

49:43.900 --> 49:45.300
Thank you.

49:54.500 --> 49:55.800
Are you looking to kill yourself?

50:35.000 --> 50:36.200
Town well's contaminated.

50:46.400 --> 50:47.800
This is dirty. It's dirty.

51:29.300 --> 51:29.900
What?

51:47.500 --> 51:48.400
Mr. Waddington?

52:36.400 --> 52:37.200
Mrs. Fane?

52:38.500 --> 52:39.200
Mrs. Fane!

52:43.600 --> 52:46.400
Come away. Come away.

53:06.900 --> 53:08.100
What's the matter with Te-Ming?

53:10.400 --> 53:12.300
You have the dead man on you.

53:13.500 --> 53:14.900
They're very superstitious, aren't they?

53:15.500 --> 53:18.400
She's lost three children and a husband
to the cholera.

53:19.000 --> 53:20.600
So, you can hardly blame her.

53:39.700 --> 53:40.600
You know,

53:41.400 --> 53:42.600
this is no place for a woman.

53:49.600 --> 53:51.200
When they telegraphed me
that you were

53:51.300 --> 53:54.200
coming out, I was astonished.

53:56.200 --> 53:59.900
I imagined you might be a grim-visaged
old nurse...

54:00.100 --> 54:02.000
...with thick legs and a mustache.

54:05.200 --> 54:07.100
I came into the bungalow
and there you were...

54:08.500 --> 54:11.800
...frail and tired...

54:12.900 --> 54:13.800
...and very unhappy.

54:15.600 --> 54:16.700
It was a long journey.

54:17.600 --> 54:18.900
But you're unhappy now.

54:21.700 --> 54:23.100
And it occurred to me that you and your

54:23.200 --> 54:25.200
husband might be madly in love...

54:26.200 --> 54:28.000
...and that you'd simply refused
to stay behind.

54:29.300 --> 54:31.300
That's a reasonable explanation.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.600
Yes. But it's not the right one.

54:37.100 --> 54:38.600
Do you know what I find strange?

54:40.500 --> 54:42.200
That your husband should never look
at you.

54:43.100 --> 54:47.100
He looks at the walls, the floor,
his shoes.

54:49.900 --> 54:51.600
He has a great deal on his mind.

54:52.700 --> 54:54.000
Yes, I'm sure of it.

54:58.600 --> 54:59.500
Dr. Fane!

55:00.600 --> 55:01.300
Dr. Fane!

55:03.700 --> 55:04.500
Oh, God.

55:07.200 --> 55:08.100
All right.

55:40.000 --> 55:41.000
What are you doing?

55:45.500 --> 55:46.200
Martini?

55:57.300 --> 55:58.400
Yes?

56:01.900 --> 56:06.100
I'm the bearer of a message from the
Mother Superior.

56:11.100 --> 56:12.000
Who?

56:12.900 --> 56:17.000
The nun who supervises the orphanage
and the hospital.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.400
I didn't know she was aware of
my existence.

56:24.100 --> 56:26.600
Well, apparently Mr. Waddington
has spoken of you.

56:27.200 --> 56:30.300
She would very much like to meet
the loving...

56:31.300 --> 56:34.000
...loyal wife of the compassionate
Dr. Fane.

56:34.600 --> 56:38.200
Right. Then I must prepare myself
for the charade.

56:38.300 --> 56:41.000
She does understand if you...

56:42.500 --> 56:44.500
...don't want to venture into the center
of the epidemic.

56:45.800 --> 56:47.400
If you're not afraid, why should I be?

56:48.300 --> 56:49.300
I forgot.

56:51.500 --> 56:52.200
Walter!

56:52.500 --> 56:53.400
Oh, my God!

56:55.400 --> 56:56.700
Oh, you're drunk.

57:34.300 --> 57:35.400
(Foreigner!)

57:35.500 --> 57:36.800
(Go home!)

57:54.800 --> 57:55.900
Don't expect anything grand.

57:56.000 --> 57:57.500
They're miserably poor.

58:18.000 --> 58:18.900
Hello.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.700
It's a great pleasure to make
the acquaintance

58:21.800 --> 58:24.400
of the wife of our good and brave doctor.

58:24.600 --> 58:25.800
Lovely to meet you, too.

58:26.500 --> 58:27.500
Mr. Waddington.

58:29.900 --> 58:31.400
You must eat the madeleines.

58:32.100 --> 58:35.300
Sister St. Joseph made them for you
herself this morning.

58:41.500 --> 58:42.900
So, tell me, Mrs. Fane.

58:43.900 --> 58:45.800
To which faith do you subscribe?

58:49.200 --> 58:50.000
Excuse me.

58:52.800 --> 58:54.400
We attended services,

58:55.500 --> 58:57.800
not religiously regularly.

58:59.300 --> 59:01.500
You could say I'm a member of the
Church of England.

59:03.500 --> 59:05.000
Which is an inoffensive way
of saying you

59:05.100 --> 59:07.000
don't quite believe in anything much.

59:09.800 --> 59:10.600
You're very pretty.

59:11.900 --> 59:13.000
And very young.

59:13.900 --> 59:16.800
I assure you I'm not. I feel ancient.

59:21.800 --> 59:23.800
If Mrs. Fane would like to see
over the convent...

59:23.900 --> 59:26.400
...and orphanage. I shall be glad
to show her.

59:28.200 --> 59:29.200
Alone.

59:43.300 --> 59:45.600
We keep the older girls busy
with sewing.

59:45.700 --> 59:47.200
It keeps them occupied.

59:48.200 --> 59:50.300
And earns money for the convent.

59:54.300 --> 59:57.400
That one won't allow us to baptize her.

01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:07.400
Our music room.

01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:11.200
Sister Maryse.

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.400
Sister Dominique was our pianist.

01:00:36.600 --> 01:00:40.000
She died last week. Cholera.

01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:47.200
Through there is the infirmary.

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:52.600
It is not a sight one would wish to see.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.800
Shall I call Dr. Fane out to see you?

01:00:56.900 --> 01:00:59.400
No. You needn't disturb him.

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.800
Now, with the epidemic...

01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:04.700
...we have even more to care for.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:07.800
This baby was brought in this morning.

01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.000
Another orphan.

01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:18.500
She says Dr. Fane loves babies.

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.100
He spends as much time as he can
in the nursery.

01:01:31.300 --> 01:01:32.200
Mrs. Fane?

01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:35.300
Mrs. Fane?

01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:37.600
You all right?

01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:39.100
Yes.

01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:41.700
It's nothing...

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:44.700
...only foolishness.

01:02:43.500 --> 01:02:44.500
What do you want?

01:02:46.300 --> 01:02:47.200
Sorry.

01:02:49.300 --> 01:02:50.600
I brought you your supper.

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:51.700
All right. Just leave it there.

01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:00.800
Is there something else?

01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:02.400
What's that you're doing?

01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:10.000
I am testing the nitrate levels of a
local tomato.

01:03:11.800 --> 01:03:12.300
Why?

01:03:14.100 --> 01:03:14.900
Why?

01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:17.700
Can't possibly interest you.

01:03:20.900 --> 01:03:24.100
Well, enjoy your supper.

01:03:33.800 --> 01:03:34.900
Walter.

01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.000
What do you propose we should do if
we get through the epidemic?

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:41.600
I have no ideas.

01:03:42.500 --> 01:03:43.400
But I don't think any good will come...

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.000
...of always talking about a
situation that we

01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:46.200
should do much better to forget.

01:03:46.300 --> 01:03:47.600
But you don't forget.

01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:49.200
Please. I really must work.

01:03:49.400 --> 01:03:51.000
Won't you listen to what I have to say?

01:03:51.400 --> 01:03:52.800
All right. If you insist.

01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.800
It's, it's just today, having...

01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:05.600
...been at the convent with those nuns.

01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:07.100
What have they done, converted you?

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:08.200
No.

01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400
They spoke of you.
And it made me feel...

01:04:12.500 --> 01:04:13.300
What?

01:04:14.500 --> 01:04:17.400
- It made you feel what?
- I think I've been afraid of you.

01:04:17.500 --> 01:04:18.400
Well, you should have been.

01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:22.800
Excuse me.

01:04:23.500 --> 01:04:25.300
If, if I can't work, I'm going to bed.

01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.200
I know you're angry at me. But if we

01:04:40.300 --> 01:04:41.300
could just try and talk about...

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.800
Honestly, I don't understand you.

01:04:44.900 --> 01:04:46.600
What is it that you want from me?

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:48.800
Perhaps I just want us to be a little

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:49.800
less unhappy.

01:04:49.900 --> 01:04:51.600
You're mistaken in thinking that
I'm unhappy.

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:52.800
I have far too much to do here to think of

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:53.800
you very much at all.

01:04:53.900 --> 01:04:56.100
That's exactly what I'm trying to say.

01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:57.500
I feel useless.

01:04:57.600 --> 01:04:58.400
What do you propose that
I do about that?

01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.800
For God's sakes, Walter!

01:04:59.900 --> 01:05:01.200
Will you stop punishing me?

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.600
Do you absolutely despise me?

01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:10.700
No. I despise myself.

01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:11.400
Why?

01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:13.900
For allowing myself to love you once.

01:07:28.900 --> 01:07:30.700
Hello.

01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.900
I hope I haven't come at an
inconvenient time.

01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:12.200
Sister Maryse died last night.

01:08:13.300 --> 01:08:15.300
I've just written to inform her parents.

01:08:15.900 --> 01:08:16.800
I'm so sorry.

01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:21.100
But it is sinful of me to grieve...

01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:25.500
...when I know that her good and simple
soul has flown straight to heaven.

01:08:27.899 --> 01:08:29.000
How can I help you?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:34.100
Well, I'm sure that with the
sister's death...

01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.800
...you must be even more shorthanded.

01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:41.399
You see, I was wondering if I
could come to the convent...

01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:46.100
...and do anything just, just to help out.

01:08:46.899 --> 01:08:49.000
My dear child, don't you think
you've done enough...

01:08:49.100 --> 01:08:50.500
...coming here with your husband?

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:52.000
I've been here a month.

01:08:53.100 --> 01:08:55.700
Believe me, I have nothing to do from
morning till night.

01:08:56.600 --> 01:08:59.300
Perhaps I could help with the sisters
in the hospital.

01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:04.200
That is impossible. Cholera is a
terrible thing to see.

01:09:04.300 --> 01:09:06.300
Besides, what would happen if
you should fall ill?

01:09:06.399 --> 01:09:09.399
I'd be happy to scrub the floors,
anything...

01:09:09.500 --> 01:09:12.100
...just something to feel useful.

01:09:13.200 --> 01:09:15.000
That will not be necessary.

01:09:15.500 --> 01:09:17.399
The orphans scrub the floors.

01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:22.200
No, no, it is our business and
our privilege to do such things.

01:09:25.000 --> 01:09:28.000
But there is always more to do each day.

01:09:30.100 --> 01:09:32.300
Have you spoken to your husband
of your wish?

01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:34.100
Yes.

01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:47.200
I don't know what you're saying.

01:09:56.900 --> 01:09:58.700
I also found traces in the river,

01:09:58.800 --> 01:10:00.500
downstream from the burial grounds.

01:10:00.800 --> 01:10:02.000
You've checked these results?

01:10:02.200 --> 01:10:03.400
I tested it three times.

01:10:06.300 --> 01:10:08.300
Well, that's it then.

01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.800
I would recommend barricading
the bathing area...

01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:13.800
...cut off all access to the river.

01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:16.800
How far do you expect people
to walk for their water?

01:10:17.700 --> 01:10:18.600
I've no idea.

01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:21.500
Up river, at least a half-mile above
the burial ground.

01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:23.200
That's too far.

01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.400
Nevertheless.

01:10:24.800 --> 01:10:26.200
I agree with Dr. Fane.

01:10:27.900 --> 01:10:28.800
It's necessary.

01:10:30.300 --> 01:10:32.100
Also, I thought we'd agreed to post
a directive...

01:10:32.600 --> 01:10:34.400
...ordering people to dispose
of the corpses immediately.

01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.000
We have done that already, Doctor.

01:10:36.100 --> 01:10:38.000
Yes, but if you don't enforce it
then it doesn't matter.

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.100
Because the families are hiding
the bodies for days.

01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:41.800
Then they bury them too close
to the river.

01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:44.600
I understand the problem.
You don't have to explain it twice.

01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:50.400
Colonel, I respectfully request that...

01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:51.800
you order your soldiers...

01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.100
...to enter these people's homes...

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100
...and remove the bodies by force
if necessary.

01:11:01.900 --> 01:11:02.800
It's all right.

01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.100
Hello.

01:11:48.300 --> 01:11:49.700
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

01:11:49.900 --> 01:11:52.700
The spirits need access to the water.
I understand that.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:56.000
I just want to move a few of these
so that they don't live in the water.

01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:05.300
He said that they're under the protection
of their warlord.

01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:08.100
If he wants to move the bodies,
he will send his own soldiers.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.200
These really aren't the best times
for a Western woman...

01:12:20.300 --> 01:12:22.200
...to go exploring a Chinese town
by herself.

01:12:22.800 --> 01:12:24.200
Oh, do be quiet.

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:28.000
As if you care whether I'm killed by
Nationalists or boredom.

01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:31.200
Besides, I wasn't alone.

01:12:32.600 --> 01:12:35.300
I was with my gallant protector
Sung Ching.

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:39.800
By the way...

01:12:40.600 --> 01:12:41.900
...you might be happy to know that...

01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.700
...I am just as useless to the nuns
as I am to you.

01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:50.700
I shut off the town's only
water supply today.

01:12:54.500 --> 01:12:55.400
What will you do?

01:12:58.700 --> 01:13:00.100
I have no idea.

01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.300
Then I suppose we're both useless.

01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:14.100
At last, something in common.

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:37.900
Dr. Fane. We've both been caught out
in the weather.

01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:38.800
Not now, sorry.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.600
I beg your pardon?

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:42.800
Counting.

01:14:42.900 --> 01:14:43.800
Counting?

01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:03.200
We'll camp here tonight.

01:15:10.300 --> 01:15:12.400
What makes you think this
warlord fellow will cooperate?

01:15:13.900 --> 01:15:15.000
I don't think he will.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.300
So, what do you plan to say to
persuade him?

01:15:17.900 --> 01:15:18.600
I don't know.

01:15:22.900 --> 01:15:24.500
These men are like animals.

01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.400
They have no vision.

01:15:28.200 --> 01:15:29.700
They only have hunger and strength.

01:15:32.500 --> 01:15:36.300
Men like this have held the real power
in China since I was young.

01:15:37.100 --> 01:15:39.200
But that time is coming to an end.

01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:42.800
There's no place for them
in the new China.

01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.600
I don't think you like my being here
very much either, do you?

01:15:49.800 --> 01:15:51.900
I think China belongs to
Chinese people...

01:15:52.700 --> 01:15:55.300
...but the rest of the world seems to
disagree.

01:15:55.900 --> 01:15:57.400
Yes, but that's got nothing to do
with me.

01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:01.400
I didn't come here with a gun, you know.

01:16:01.500 --> 01:16:02.600
I came here with a microscope.

01:16:03.600 --> 01:16:04.500
I believe you.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:10.400
But it would be nice to do this
work together...

01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:13.600
...without your country's guns pointing
at our people.

01:16:21.800 --> 01:16:24.500
Our plan is to divert the water to
the town from the fields upriver...

01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:25.600
...above the burial grounds.

01:16:26.900 --> 01:16:29.500
With your permission and
the assistance of your troops...

01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:31.500
...the graves will be moved away
from the water.

01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:33.200
And Colonel Yu and his men...

01:16:33.300 --> 01:16:35.500
...will enforce the prompt burial
of the dead...

01:16:36.500 --> 01:16:38.200
...maintaining the integrity of the
water sources...

01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400
...and enforcing proper sanitation
over the next few weeks.

01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:44.500
It will make a difference between a few
more deaths and possibly thousands.

01:16:46.500 --> 01:16:48.800
(He says, if we keep the
water source clean,)

01:16:48.900 --> 01:16:50.200
(and enforce proper
sanitation procedures,)

01:16:50.300 --> 01:16:51.100
(then in a few weeks,)

01:16:51.200 --> 01:16:52.300
(the death toll...)

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:55.100
(...could reduce more than
one thousand.)

01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:58.400
(Is he finished?)

01:17:00.300 --> 01:17:03.100
(I won't sacrifice my men to that
cholera mess.)

01:17:03.500 --> 01:17:04.400
(Forget it!)

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:05.800
(When people die...)

01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:08.700
(...it's destiny! I'll have nothing
to do with it!)

01:17:09.900 --> 01:17:10.800
(You...)

01:17:11.200 --> 01:17:12.500
(...get him out of here!)

01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:15.600
He said no.

01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:21.500
He doesn't speak any English, does he?

01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:30.400
Tell him that's the most ridiculous suit
that I've ever seen.

01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:39.200
(This Doctor respects you greatly...)

01:17:41.300 --> 01:17:42.500
(and you are right.)

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.400
(It is quite a mess, this epidemic.)

01:17:46.500 --> 01:17:47.900
(But my superior said...)

01:17:48.700 --> 01:17:50.900
(...if your men cannot control it...)

01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:56.000
(...then our army will be happy
to help you.)

01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:00.200
(After seeing this place...)

01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.800
(...it's so overwhelming...)

01:18:05.900 --> 01:18:08.000
(...I'm afraid once our soldiers
are here...)

01:18:08.200 --> 01:18:09.200
(...they won't want to leave.)

01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:52.900
I'm sorry.

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:54.700
Do not stop on my account...

01:18:54.800 --> 01:18:58.900
...if Dr. Fane is enjoying himself.

01:18:59.100 --> 01:19:00.600
No, no, not at all.

01:19:01.900 --> 01:19:03.200
It's very nice. I was passing...

01:19:03.300 --> 01:19:04.500
No. Stay.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.400
I should go.

01:19:05.500 --> 01:19:06.700
I insist.

01:19:11.900 --> 01:19:12.900
All right, if you like.

01:19:13.500 --> 01:19:15.000
Continue, Mrs. Fane.

01:19:15.500 --> 01:19:19.800
But perhaps something a little
more soothing.

01:19:20.500 --> 01:19:21.600
Yes, of course.

01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:43.500
They brought in a new baby today.

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.000
The girls named her Zan Xien.

01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:48.800
It means "brand new."

01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:53.600
The nuns are going to call it Katherine...

01:20:53.700 --> 01:20:56.000
...which, of course, none of the girls
will be able to say.

01:20:59.200 --> 01:21:00.800
Thank goodness for those nuns.

01:21:01.600 --> 01:21:03.700
They do so much for so little in return.

01:21:04.500 --> 01:21:06.000
I suppose you can look at it that way.

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:08.800
You suppose?

01:21:10.300 --> 01:21:12.400
I think it might be a bit more
complicated than that.

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.400
They take in desperate children and
give them a chance at life.

01:21:17.500 --> 01:21:19.200
What could be so complicated
about that?

01:21:20.400 --> 01:21:22.500
They also go to young mothers
in their homes.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:25.200
They ask them to give their babies
to the convent.

01:21:26.600 --> 01:21:28.200
They offer them money to support
their families...

01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:29.700
...to persuade them to do it.

01:21:30.900 --> 01:21:33.600
They're not just here to run
an orphanage, your nuns.

01:21:34.300 --> 01:21:36.000
They're turning those children
into little Catholics.

01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.500
None of us are in China
without a reason.

01:21:41.200 --> 01:21:42.600
Still, on the whole...

01:21:42.700 --> 01:21:43.800
...I think that what they're doing...

01:21:43.900 --> 01:21:46.800
...is a pretty good deed, don't you?

01:21:46.900 --> 01:21:48.200
I'm here to study bacteria.

01:21:48.300 --> 01:21:50.400
I don't feel the need to have an opinion
about the rest of it.

01:21:50.500 --> 01:21:52.400
Well, I do, and I admire them.

01:21:53.600 --> 01:21:57.200
I don't think it has to be so complicated
and gloomy.

01:22:02.800 --> 01:22:07.700
And I think what you're doing,
for instance, is incredibly noble.

01:22:09.200 --> 01:22:11.600
You used to feel contempt for me.
Don't you still?

01:22:11.900 --> 01:22:15.000
Walter. I can't believe that you with
all your cleverness...

01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:17.400
...should have such little sense
of proportion.

01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:22.600
We humans are more complex
than your silly little microbes.

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.800
We're unpredictable. We make
mistakes and we disappoint.

01:22:27.300 --> 01:22:28.500
Yes, we certainly do.

01:22:28.600 --> 01:22:29.500
I'm sorry.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.100
I'm sorry I'm not the perfect young
woman that you want me to be.

01:22:34.600 --> 01:22:35.800
I'm just ordinary.

01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:40.100
I never tried to pretend that
I was anything else.

01:22:48.100 --> 01:22:49.800
No, you certainly didn't.

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:53.900
I like the theater...

01:22:54.200 --> 01:22:55.500
...and dancing and...

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.000
...playing tennis. I like games.
I like men who play games.

01:23:01.100 --> 01:23:03.400
God forgive me, that's the way
I was brought up.

01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.400
Well, I play a pretty fierce
hand of bridge.

01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:08.100
Oh, well, that's bloody exciting.

01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:16.200
And you, you dragged me around all
those interminable galleries in Venice...

01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:19.000
...blathering on about the miracle
of the canals...

01:23:19.100 --> 01:23:21.400
...and the flashing of the
lagoon system...

01:23:22.400 --> 01:23:23.700
...or some such nonsense.

01:23:23.800 --> 01:23:27.400
Honestly, I'd have been much happier
playing golf at Sandwich.

01:23:34.000 --> 01:23:35.100
I suppose you're right.

01:23:37.400 --> 01:23:40.200
It was silly of us to look for qualities
in each other that we never had.

01:23:42.600 --> 01:23:43.600
Yes.

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:46.700
Yes, it was.

01:23:52.100 --> 01:23:53.000
Walter?

01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.000
Why didn't you break down that door...

01:23:58.100 --> 01:24:00.100
...when you knew I was in there
with Charlie?

01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:04.800
You might have at least tried
to thrash him.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.200
He wasn't worth it.

01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:14.500
Or maybe I'm just too proud to fight.

01:24:16.300 --> 01:24:17.600
I don't know about that.

01:24:21.400 --> 01:24:23.500
(Bury corpses immediately.)

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:26.600
(Please don't take him away!)

01:24:26.700 --> 01:24:29.800
(His spirit will never rest!)

01:24:45.700 --> 01:24:49.200
I've told Mother Superior to keep her
sisters inside the convent.

01:24:49.800 --> 01:24:51.200
I put a guard outside the gate.

01:24:52.300 --> 01:24:55.200
I'd advise any Westerners
to stay indoors.

01:24:55.300 --> 01:24:56.100
All right.

01:25:04.800 --> 01:25:07.300
Sister, has Mrs. Fane been
at the convent today?

01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:10.300
Yes. But she, she has left
a few minutes ago.

01:25:18.400 --> 01:25:21.000
(This is the work of the British devil!)

01:25:21.100 --> 01:25:23.900
(Respect our traditions!)

01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:39.200
Sung Ching.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:42.400
Let's go!

01:25:43.100 --> 01:25:43.800
Let's go!

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:46.300
Let's go!

01:26:17.300 --> 01:26:20.600
Sung Ching. Where's Mrs. Fane?
Where's Mrs. Fane?!

01:26:37.400 --> 01:26:38.600
I don't know what you're saying!

01:26:39.500 --> 01:26:40.700
Get away from her.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:42.800
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:26:59.900 --> 01:27:00.600
Come on.

01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.800
We're out of whiskey.

01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:02.800
Dr. Fane.

01:28:03.700 --> 01:28:05.000
Could I trouble you for a drink?

01:28:33.100 --> 01:28:33.900
Hello, darling.

01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:55.800
I was stationed at Hankow
during the revolution...

01:28:55.900 --> 01:28:58.000
...when they were massacring
all the Manchus.

01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:02.100
I was able to help a particular family.

01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:04.200
New documents, that sort of thing.

01:29:05.200 --> 01:29:07.000
She was the youngest of the daughters.

01:29:09.200 --> 01:29:12.100
I didn't pay her too much attention
at first.

01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:16.200
Well, more than I should have,
I suppose.

01:29:18.100 --> 01:29:21.600
When I left Hankow, she followed me.

01:29:23.100 --> 01:29:26.500
I sent her back two, three times.
But she...

01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:28.700
...she kept coming back.

01:29:34.900 --> 01:29:37.800
I didn't realize you had so much
affection for her.

01:29:38.200 --> 01:29:39.300
What makes you think I do?

01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:44.500
I can see it in your eyes.

01:29:48.500 --> 01:29:50.100
Men are incalculable.

01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:54.200
I thought you were just like
everybody else...

01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.200
...now I feel I don't know the first thing
about you.

01:30:02.300 --> 01:30:03.800
I wonder what she sees in you.

01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.400
Wan Xi.

01:30:17.500 --> 01:30:19.800
She says I'm a good man.

01:30:29.600 --> 01:30:32.400
As if a woman ever loved a man
for his virtue.

01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:18.900
Morning.

01:34:28.900 --> 01:34:29.800
Morning.

01:34:34.100 --> 01:34:37.100
I should think it best to stay away
from town today.

01:34:38.000 --> 01:34:38.800
All right.

01:35:00.300 --> 01:35:01.400
I'm going for a walk.

01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:08.900
Come on, then.

01:35:53.300 --> 01:35:55.100
What on earth are you doing all the way
out here?

01:35:55.600 --> 01:35:57.200
Walking off a crippling hangover.

01:35:58.600 --> 01:35:59.600
What are you doing?

01:36:00.300 --> 01:36:04.200
I've been attempting to purchase
a stalk of bamboo.

01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:06.400
But his price is exorbitant.

01:36:06.700 --> 01:36:07.700
Or my head is...

01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:09.300
...too shattered to negotiate.

01:36:16.800 --> 01:36:17.700
So...

01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:20.500
- Would you like a ride home?
- On what?

01:36:20.900 --> 01:36:22.000
The buffalo?

01:37:11.800 --> 01:37:14.400
You see, we're diverting it from
these fields temporarily...

01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:15.800
...sending it straight into the center

01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.600
of town where they can get it easily.

01:37:18.200 --> 01:37:21.100
It's over a half-mile. It gave us a devil
of a time in some places.

01:37:38.800 --> 01:37:40.300
But it's worth it.

01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:56.900
Oh, Mother.

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.800
Am I going to die?

01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:04.200
Come, come. You mustn't be so silly.

01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.100
Listen, ma chere...

01:39:06.500 --> 01:39:08.300
...is it possible that you're with child?

01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:14.500
- No.
- Oh, yes.

01:39:14.600 --> 01:39:15.600
- No.
- Yes.

01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:18.100
I mean...

01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.400
I...

01:39:23.300 --> 01:39:24.900
I suppose it's possible.

01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:26.500
There is no doubt about it.

01:39:26.800 --> 01:39:29.100
Yes. Sister St. Joseph knew at once.

01:39:29.300 --> 01:39:31.200
She comes from a large family so she

01:39:31.300 --> 01:39:33.300
has experience in these matters.

01:39:34.600 --> 01:39:35.500
I can't believe it.

01:39:35.900 --> 01:39:37.400
Why can't you believe it?

01:39:38.400 --> 01:39:39.900
Having a child is so natural.

01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:43.200
Yes.

01:39:43.400 --> 01:39:45.300
Think how happy your husband will be.

01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:08.200
And what's happened here?

01:40:08.300 --> 01:40:10.100
- I'm all right.
- They said you fainted.

01:40:10.300 --> 01:40:11.200
I'm fine.

01:40:11.500 --> 01:40:13.200
- Let me look at you.
- It's not cholera.

01:40:13.900 --> 01:40:15.700
No. I don't think so.

01:40:16.700 --> 01:40:18.500
Did you feel nauseous? Or just faint?

01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.900
Walter, stop.

01:40:24.800 --> 01:40:25.800
I'm pregnant.

01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:27.900
A baby?

01:40:32.300 --> 01:40:33.300
You're quite certain?

01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:34.800
Yes.

01:40:38.900 --> 01:40:39.900
Well, that's wonderful.

01:40:46.300 --> 01:40:48.500
How long do you think you've been
like this?

01:40:51.400 --> 01:40:52.300
Two months.

01:40:54.100 --> 01:40:55.100
Maybe longer.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:14.200
Kitty.

01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:19.500
Am I the father?

01:41:24.800 --> 01:41:26.200
I honestly don't know.

01:41:29.500 --> 01:41:30.200
I'm sorry.

01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:38.900
Well.

01:41:44.700 --> 01:41:46.000
It doesn't matter now.

01:41:48.100 --> 01:41:48.900
Does it?

01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:50.800
No.

01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:54.800
No, it doesn't.

01:42:57.500 --> 01:42:58.400
Dr. Fane!

01:43:00.200 --> 01:43:01.000
Come with me.

01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:18.200
What is this? Where are they
coming from?

01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:21.200
The cholera spread south
along the river.

01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:23.500
They have no doctors or facilities there.

01:43:23.900 --> 01:43:25.200
If they come in,
they'll contaminate everything.

01:43:25.300 --> 01:43:26.600
We've got to keep them
outside the town.

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:28.200
Dr. Fane!

01:43:41.500 --> 01:43:42.400
Dr. Fane!

01:43:56.100 --> 01:43:57.300
Stop! Stop!

01:43:57.500 --> 01:43:58.200
Stop!

01:44:01.300 --> 01:44:02.900
Please stop here!
We can help you here!

01:44:03.900 --> 01:44:05.300
Colonel, tell them not to
go into the town!

01:44:05.400 --> 01:44:06.400
Tell them we'll help them here!

01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:37.200
Mrs. Fane. Gather all the children
in the music room.

01:44:39.400 --> 01:44:40.100
Wait here.

01:44:41.800 --> 01:44:42.800
Let's go!

01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:23.400
That boy. Bring him here,
bring him here.

01:46:47.300 --> 01:46:48.800
He has a cut. I'll treat him.

01:47:37.100 --> 01:47:38.500
I don't understand.

01:47:39.000 --> 01:47:40.000
Why didn't he wake me?

01:47:40.900 --> 01:47:44.100
He made an early start.
And you needed the rest.

01:47:46.500 --> 01:47:48.100
How far is the refugee camp?

01:47:48.600 --> 01:47:51.000
Just outside the town, in the foothills.

01:47:55.200 --> 01:47:59.100
Dr. Fane told me he wanted you
to leave, but you would not.

01:47:59.800 --> 01:48:01.800
I didn't want to leave you.

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.900
Yes. And we appreciate it,
dear child, but...

01:48:05.700 --> 01:48:07.400
...I think you did not want to
leave him either.

01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:11.300
Well... it's my duty.

01:48:11.700 --> 01:48:14.500
Duty is only washing your hands
when they are dirty.

01:48:19.400 --> 01:48:21.000
I fell in love when I was 17...

01:48:22.400 --> 01:48:23.300
...with God.

01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:27.400
A foolish girl with romantic notions...

01:48:27.500 --> 01:48:29.800
...about the life of a religious.

01:48:31.000 --> 01:48:32.400
But my love was passionate.

01:48:35.500 --> 01:48:38.000
Over the years, my feelings
have changed.

01:48:39.300 --> 01:48:41.700
He's disappointed me. Ignored me.

01:48:43.500 --> 01:48:49.100
We've settled into a relationship
of peaceful indifference.

01:48:49.800 --> 01:48:53.100
The old husband and wife who sit
side by side on the sofa,

01:48:53.200 --> 01:48:54.200
but rarely speak.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:58.600
He knows I will never leave Him.

01:48:59.400 --> 01:49:00.500
This is my duty.

01:49:01.900 --> 01:49:04.400
But when love and duty are one.

01:49:05.900 --> 01:49:07.600
...then grace is within you.

01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.600
Your soldier is waiting to take you back.

01:49:17.500 --> 01:49:18.400
I'd rather stay.

01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:19.500
No.

01:49:37.100 --> 01:49:38.100
What? What is it?

01:49:39.300 --> 01:49:40.000
What?

01:49:40.500 --> 01:49:41.500
Mrs. Fane?

01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:44.100
Mr. Waddington?

01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:46.300
It's your husband.

01:49:46.800 --> 01:49:48.000
What? What is it?

01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:49.200
He's been taken ill.

01:50:10.900 --> 01:50:11.500
Where is he?

01:50:15.600 --> 01:50:16.500
Mrs. Fane?

01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:25.700
Walter!

01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:26.900
Oh, no. She can't be here.

01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:28.400
It's not safe. Waddington!

01:50:28.900 --> 01:50:30.400
I'm afraid I've got no say in the matter

01:50:43.500 --> 01:50:44.400
I don't want an audience.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:46.800
You have to go.

01:50:47.900 --> 01:50:48.800
Your baby.

01:50:49.100 --> 01:50:50.400
Please, you must go.

01:50:57.800 --> 01:51:00.500
Walter, tell me what I should do.

01:51:00.700 --> 01:51:02.800
Slow that drip down.
It's running too fast.

01:51:03.500 --> 01:51:05.000
Good, good.

01:51:05.100 --> 01:51:06.700
Kitty? Kitty.

01:51:10.800 --> 01:51:13.100
It's going to get much worse
before it breaks.

01:51:15.300 --> 01:51:16.100
Are you prepared for this?

01:51:18.800 --> 01:51:19.500
Yes.

01:52:09.900 --> 01:52:10.700
What is it?

01:52:11.300 --> 01:52:13.300
(We're running out of saline.)

01:52:15.300 --> 01:52:16.300
Can you send for more?

01:52:17.300 --> 01:52:18.000
(I have...)

01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:20.800
(...but for many it will be too late.)

01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.200
Kitty.

01:53:05.300 --> 01:53:06.000
Kitty.

01:53:09.900 --> 01:53:10.900
Are you awake?

01:53:15.300 --> 01:53:16.300
Are you feeling better?

01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600
Forgive me.

01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:47.000
Forgive you?

01:53:53.800 --> 01:53:55.100
There's nothing to forgive.

01:54:18.100 --> 01:54:21.200
Walter.

01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:22.700
I'm sorry.

01:54:53.700 --> 01:54:54.500
I'm so sorry.

01:54:57.100 --> 01:54:57.900
Mrs. Fane?

01:55:01.900 --> 01:55:03.900
Dr. Fane would want to be
buried immediately.

01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:09.100
Yes, of course.

01:55:32.400 --> 01:55:38.000
(At the clear fountain,
while I was strolling by)

01:55:38.500 --> 01:55:44.400
(I found the water so nice that
I went in to bathe)

01:55:45.800 --> 01:55:52.500
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:55:53.500 --> 01:55:58.600
(Under an oak tree, I dried myself)

01:55:58.900 --> 01:56:05.100
(On the highest branch, a nightingale
was singing)

01:56:05.900 --> 01:56:12.500
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:56:13.500 --> 01:56:18.800
(Sing, nightingale, sing,
your heart is so happy)

01:56:18.900 --> 01:56:25.000
(Your heart feels like laughing,
mine feels like weeping)

01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:26.300
What are you doing?

01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:32.900
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.500
(I lost my beloved without deserving it)

01:56:39.900 --> 01:56:46.900
(For a bunch of roses that I denied him)

01:56:47.100 --> 01:56:54.200
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:56:55.400 --> 01:57:01.200
(I wanted the rose to be
still on the bush)

01:57:01.500 --> 01:57:08.900
(And my sweet beloved to be
still loving me)

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:16.400
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:22.800
(At the clear fountain,
while I was strolling by)

01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:29.500
(I found the water so nice that
I went in to bathe)

01:57:30.300 --> 01:57:37.200
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:57:37.600 --> 01:57:43.000
(Under an oak tree, I dried myself)

01:57:43.400 --> 01:57:49.700
(On the highest branch, a nightingale
was singing)

01:57:50.300 --> 01:58:00.400
(So long I've been loving you,
I will never forget you)

01:58:10.900 --> 01:58:12.100
It's silly, really.

01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.400
They'll die in a week.

01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:16.800
It's hardly worth the cost.

01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.600
What do you think?

01:58:19.800 --> 01:58:21.100
I think they're quite nice.

01:58:22.200 --> 01:58:23.100
Really?

01:58:24.600 --> 01:58:25.800
I think you're right.

01:58:28.500 --> 01:58:29.400
Come on.

01:58:32.500 --> 01:58:34.700
We better hurry. Grandfather's waiting.

01:58:39.100 --> 01:58:39.900
Kitty Fane?

01:58:43.900 --> 01:58:45.400
As I live and breathe.

01:58:45.800 --> 01:58:46.800
Hello, Charlie.

01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.800
What are you doing in London?

01:58:52.400 --> 01:58:54.000
I know it's been a long time.

01:58:55.900 --> 01:58:57.000
I should have written.

01:59:00.300 --> 01:59:02.400
Who's this fine chap? Hello, young man.

01:59:02.900 --> 01:59:03.800
What's your name?

01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:05.100
Walter.

01:59:05.200 --> 01:59:08.800
Hello, Walter. I'm Charlie Townsend.

01:59:10.300 --> 01:59:11.200
How old are you?

01:59:11.600 --> 01:59:12.500
Five.

01:59:13.200 --> 01:59:15.900
Come on, darling. We should really
press on.

01:59:16.300 --> 01:59:17.300
Yes, of course.

01:59:18.400 --> 01:59:21.400
Well, it's lovely seeing you again.

01:59:24.700 --> 01:59:25.800
Goodbye, Walter.

01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000
Goodbye.

01:59:31.500 --> 01:59:32.300
Kitty!

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000
I'm going to be in London for the next
3 weeks. Perhaps we could...

01:59:36.100 --> 01:59:37.200
Goodbye, Mr. Townsend.

01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:40.700
Goodbye, Mrs. Fane.

01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:45.800
Who was that, Mommy?

01:59:47.400 --> 01:59:48.800
No one important, darling.

02:04:01.300 --> 02:04:06.900
IN LOVING MEMORY OF OUR FRIENDS
JULIE PEARCE AND JOHN TIMPERLEY
