Oh, and if you hear the guys
call me "Poopy Thumb,"

00:41.166 --> 00:42.375
i-it's just a fun nickname,

00:42.459 --> 00:43.918
it's not something that actually happened.

00:44.002 --> 00:45.920
Hey, Poopy Thumb.

00:46.004 --> 00:48.590
It was Gulden's Spicy Brown
Mustard from my sandwich.

00:48.673 --> 00:49.632
How many times do I have to say it?!

00:49.716 --> 00:51.134
(chuckles): Okay.

00:51.217 --> 00:54.220
No need to relitigate
what four of our peers saw.

00:54.304 --> 00:55.764
Hi, everyone.

00:55.847 --> 00:58.183
I'm your children's teacher, Miss Laura,

00:58.266 --> 01:00.894
and like pretty much everyone
in America right now,

01:00.977 --> 01:05.231
I'm very high on legalized edible pot.

01:05.315 --> 01:08.610
Ha-ha. (inhales sharply)

01:08.693 --> 01:13.323
It's crazy how much
your kids look like you.

01:13.406 --> 01:14.908
Wha....

01:14.991 --> 01:16.910
Peter, pay attention.

01:16.993 --> 01:19.204
Sorry, I was having a Fast Times daydream

01:19.287 --> 01:20.997
about that tank top mom.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.499
Yeah, that's disgusting.

01:22.582 --> 01:24.751
How would you like it
if she did that to you?

01:24.834 --> 01:26.836
("Moving In Stereo" by The Cars plays)

01:36.763 --> 01:38.181
PETER: I chocked on water

01:38.264 --> 01:40.517
and had to get mouth-to-mouth from a guy.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.979
Five, four,

01:45.063 --> 01:48.108
three, two, one...

01:48.191 --> 01:49.359
Yay!

01:49.442 --> 01:51.236
All right, that's officially

01:51.319 --> 01:53.530
the latest any of us have ever been up.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.240
-(yawns)
-Oh-ho!

01:55.323 --> 01:56.950
A little tired, Stewie?

01:57.033 --> 01:59.160
No. I just yawned
because somebody else yawned.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.954
I could do this all night. You tired?

02:01.037 --> 02:02.914
Oh, no. At home, they call me the night...

02:02.997 --> 02:05.125
(all snoring)

02:08.003 --> 02:09.421
Is Garrick Utley alive?

02:09.504 --> 02:11.840
I... (sighs) I don't know, Peter.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.633
Hey, I've been meaning
to ask you all night--

02:13.717 --> 02:16.678
those vintage pants are amazing,
where did you get them?

02:16.761 --> 02:19.556
Oh, they were folded neatly
on a toilet in the gas station.

02:19.639 --> 02:21.224
Hey, you know, we're starting a text chain

02:21.307 --> 02:22.934
with some of the other young parents.

02:23.018 --> 02:24.269
Young parents?

02:24.352 --> 02:26.563
Yeah, new parents like us
have to stick together.

02:26.646 --> 02:28.148
(chuckles) Yes, we do.

02:28.231 --> 02:29.941
Because we're very young.

02:30.025 --> 02:31.234
Great. Can we get your number?

02:31.317 --> 02:33.111
Sure. We're Lakeside 4-7...

02:33.194 --> 02:35.447
He's kidding.
We'll hit you with the digits.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.282
Great.

02:37.365 --> 02:39.743
Oh, my God, Peter, did you hear that?

02:39.826 --> 02:41.870
What? I'm chewing celery.
I can't hear anything.

02:41.953 --> 02:43.997
They think Stewie's our first.

02:44.080 --> 02:45.707
Ah! They think we're young.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.959
-You're hurting me.
-This is our chance.

02:48.043 --> 02:49.627
Our chance to break away

02:49.711 --> 02:51.755
from the Joes and Bonnies of the world.

02:51.838 --> 02:54.049
Our chance to finally make cool friends.

02:54.132 --> 02:55.342
Well, I don't know what
you're saying, Lois,

02:55.425 --> 02:58.219
but that horse is the dumbest horse

02:58.303 --> 03:00.388
I have ever seen in my life.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.140
MAN:
It hurt to hear,

03:02.223 --> 03:05.602
but deep down,
I respected him for saying it.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.063
Finally someone had told me the truth.

03:08.146 --> 03:11.691
And that boy grew up to have
a multiplatinum recording career.

03:11.775 --> 03:13.943
Hi, I'm Richard Marx,

03:14.027 --> 03:16.279
and I suck at making clay horses,

03:16.363 --> 03:19.115

Oh, my God, it's from Matt and Kate

03:40.595 --> 03:42.097
on that text chain.
Uh,

03:42.180 --> 03:45.850
"Heading out for 'ritas downtown
with the other young parents.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.602
Meet in 15?"

03:47.686 --> 03:49.479
Oh, Peter, we have to go!

03:49.562 --> 03:51.064
Now?

03:56.111 --> 03:57.278
Peter, look.

03:57.362 --> 03:59.364
The menu doesn't have dollar signs.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.616
It just has a number and a period.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.451
Ah! I feel like I'm in Brooklyn!

04:03.535 --> 04:06.246
Damn it, all the employees
are wearing regular clothes,

04:06.329 --> 04:08.206
so it's impossible
to ask anybody for help.

04:13.336 --> 04:14.671
MATT:
Griffins.

04:15.755 --> 04:17.882
Uh, you want to sit
at the high-seat low-table,

04:17.966 --> 04:19.259
or the low-seat high-table?

04:19.342 --> 04:21.594
(indistinct chatter)

04:21.678 --> 04:23.596
How about those four old barber chairs

04:23.680 --> 04:26.433
around the operating tables
from the state insane asylum?

04:26.516 --> 04:28.018
Ah, isn't this place great?

04:28.101 --> 04:29.394
Amazing.

04:29.477 --> 04:31.438
Hi, my name is Isaac.
I'll be your server.

04:31.521 --> 04:32.814
Have you all eaten with us before?

04:32.897 --> 04:35.108
No, but I get how restaurants work.

04:35.191 --> 04:36.943
Now, what can I get for you, hon?

04:40.030 --> 04:41.865
Well, this is us.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.117
Boy, I almost
don't want this night to end.

04:44.200 --> 04:46.244
-Me either.
-Well, I got an idea.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.621
You mind if I use your bathroom
to do number two?

04:48.705 --> 04:52.000
Wow, your place is amazing.

04:52.083 --> 04:55.378
A pool, a spa,
and all the lights are on dimmers.

04:55.462 --> 04:57.714
And a digital thermostat.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.924
Oh, my God,
it's like we're on a spaceship.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.844
Well, there's an open unit
if you guys are interested.

05:02.927 --> 05:05.221
-(toilet flush)
-Is the toilet a bit better in that one?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.348
Actually, it's kind of embarrassing,

05:06.431 --> 05:07.849
but the toilet in that one is shaped

05:07.932 --> 05:09.225
like a Hungry Hungry Hippo.

05:18.443 --> 05:20.070
I don't know, Peter.

05:20.153 --> 05:22.572
It just doesn't feel
like the responsible thing

05:22.655 --> 05:24.616
to abandon Chris and Meg.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.535
The polka dot top goes with
the white bottoms, too, right?

05:27.619 --> 05:29.746
Oh, definitely.
Very old Hollywood.

05:29.829 --> 05:32.707
Perfect.
I mean, I guess they are teenagers.

05:32.791 --> 05:36.044
-And helicopter parents, right?
-What?

05:36.127 --> 05:38.129
Helicopter parents.
It's something I read.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.964
-Oh.
-Now you say it.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.092
-Say what?
-Helicopter parents.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.719
-Helicopter parents.
-Exactly.

05:47.806 --> 05:50.892
Now, I stocked the freezer
with plenty to eat while we're gone.

05:50.975 --> 05:53.978
-On the top shelf...
-CHRIS: But all I heard was...

05:54.062 --> 05:57.148
Not pizza. Not pizza. Not pizza.

05:57.232 --> 05:59.693
And finally, this is calamari.

05:59.776 --> 06:02.070
This is my placenta.
Are you listening?

06:02.153 --> 06:03.655
You're gonna want to watch where I point.

06:03.738 --> 06:06.491
-Calamari, placenta.
-Who died again?

06:06.574 --> 06:09.577
Meg, listen to the lies.
Nobody died.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.831
An aunt of your father's
or mine is very ill.

06:12.914 --> 06:14.499
And why is Stewie going with you?

06:14.582 --> 06:16.292
Stewie loved Uncle Grandpa.

06:16.376 --> 06:17.961
Wait, uncle?
I thought you said...

06:18.044 --> 06:19.921
Helicopter parents.
Let's go, Lois.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.846
Wow, they're really gone.

06:27.929 --> 06:29.889
You know what that means.

06:29.973 --> 06:32.142
BOTH:
We can finally crate Brian!

06:32.225 --> 06:36.104
He tricked us,
and we're still waiting on that lasagna.

06:36.187 --> 06:38.106
Chris, that was the trick.

06:38.189 --> 06:39.357
Oh.

06:39.441 --> 06:40.817
He tricked us!

06:45.655 --> 06:47.741
Ah, look, we're in apartment 4G.

06:47.824 --> 06:49.159
Like the iPhone.

06:49.242 --> 06:51.578
That's stupid, Lois.
Don't ever say that again.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.705
Hey, how's everything going in there?

06:53.788 --> 06:56.291
Great.
We're in apartment 4G, like the iPhone.

06:56.374 --> 06:58.084
(chuckles):
That's so twisted.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.711
-Did you make that up?
-Yes.

06:59.794 --> 07:02.297
You guys get settled,
then a few of us are gonna sit

07:02.380 --> 07:04.799
by the firepit and say
"mid-century modern" a lot,

07:04.883 --> 07:06.343
if you want to join.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.595
-They like us.
-This is it, Peter.

07:08.678 --> 07:11.056
We're gonna vape.
We're gonna vape!

07:11.139 --> 07:13.933
It's causing deaths,
but not that many yet.

07:18.396 --> 07:22.025
Ugh, I can't believe I ate
both Tupperwares of calamari.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.152
(belches, groans)

07:24.235 --> 07:25.570
But I'm still hungry.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.988
What do we have left to eat?

07:27.072 --> 07:28.573
I'm not gonna say we're out of food,

07:28.656 --> 07:31.993
but anything still in the fridge
I have made love to.

07:32.077 --> 07:35.789
Man, this broom-handle-poked
tapioca is delicious.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.749
-Chris had sex with that.
-(spits)

07:37.832 --> 07:40.794
-Relax, I didn't finish.
-Oh.

07:49.886 --> 07:52.305
All right, Stewie, you have a playdate

07:52.389 --> 07:55.392
with Cobain, Siddhartha and Atticus.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.395
And if anyone asks,
you have plenty of sunscreen on.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.980
-But I don’t...
-Bye.

08:01.064 --> 08:03.608
Hey, I'm Cobain.
Want a strawberry Quik?

08:03.692 --> 08:05.902
Sure, I want a strawberry,
but what's the hurry?

08:05.985 --> 08:08.113
Stewie Griffin, 4G, like the iPhone.

08:08.196 --> 08:11.116
Ha. I like you.
Our deck needed a wild card.

08:11.199 --> 08:13.076
Cobain, now that you're my best friend,

08:13.159 --> 08:14.369
can I ask you a question?

08:14.452 --> 08:15.912
When is nap time?

08:15.995 --> 08:18.248
Because it's 2:15,
and I'm about to collapse.

08:18.331 --> 08:19.457
Oh, we don't take naps.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.710
No naps?
Well, then, when is bed time?

08:21.793 --> 08:22.794
Whenever.

08:22.877 --> 08:24.295
My God, when do you grow?

08:24.379 --> 08:27.090
-We don't. I'm six.
-You're six?

08:27.173 --> 08:30.218
-Why are you so small?
-I only eat tofu and seaweed.

08:30.301 --> 08:33.096
-Nothing in a cage.
-You've never had parakeet?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.597
No.
Have you?

08:34.681 --> 08:37.267
No, but it looks really yummy
in the cartoons.

08:40.645 --> 08:42.814
(indistinct chatter)

08:43.815 --> 08:46.151
All right, Peter, we can't
look like we don't belong,

08:46.234 --> 08:49.237
so when they ask you what
you want to drink, just say

08:49.320 --> 08:53.700
-"Local. Micro. Brew."
-Local. Micro. Brew.

08:53.783 --> 08:55.160
Local. Micro. Brew.

08:55.243 --> 08:56.786
Hey, Peter, what can I get you to drink?

08:56.870 --> 08:58.455
(British accent):
Give us a drop o' sherry, luv.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.123
-Peter! -(regular accent): I'm-I'm sorry.
I mean...

09:00.206 --> 09:02.375
Local. Micro. Brew.

09:07.589 --> 09:10.425
Hi, we're Lois and Peter in 4G.

09:10.508 --> 09:12.052
I really like your green pants.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.721
Oh, thanks, I found them
folded neatly on a toilet.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.724
I-I mean, I...
I only buy pants from companies

09:17.807 --> 09:20.393
that donate the same pair
to a Third World country.

09:20.477 --> 09:23.730
Run home with these expired
military condoms, Ndugu.

09:23.813 --> 09:25.648
Run and make sure they use them.

09:25.732 --> 09:27.567
("Main Title (Golden
Ticket/Pure Imagination)" playing)

09:34.074 --> 09:35.992
-(music stops)
-(grunts)

09:36.076 --> 09:38.078
(sucking on teeth and clicking tongue)

09:55.637 --> 09:56.888
(bicycle bell rings)

09:57.889 --> 09:59.683
I found Mom and Dad.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.476
Wait, what?
Where are they?

10:01.559 --> 10:03.728
Well, first I need to explain
how I found them.

10:03.812 --> 10:05.271
Let me start from the beginning.

10:05.355 --> 10:07.440
You know how I operate
a small Internet company

10:07.524 --> 10:09.526
where I buy and sell chlorine, right?

10:09.609 --> 10:11.945
-No. What?
-Chris' Chlorine?

10:12.028 --> 10:15.865
-Chris' Chlorine?
-Chris, I have no idea what...

10:15.949 --> 10:17.659
Chris' Chlorine!

10:17.742 --> 10:19.369
Stop just yelling that!

10:19.452 --> 10:21.746
Well, anyway, my guy at Millennial Village

10:21.830 --> 10:25.166
Luxury Apartments was buying
extra chlorine this week.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.335
Seems they've been finding
a lot of loose burger meat

10:27.419 --> 10:28.753
in the pool.

10:28.837 --> 10:30.672
And who do we know
that likes to go swimming

10:30.755 --> 10:32.090
with loose burger meat?

10:32.173 --> 10:35.427
-Oh, my God, Dad!
-Bingo.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.554
But more importantly, are you satisfied

10:37.637 --> 10:39.556
with your chlorine supplier, Meg?

10:39.639 --> 10:41.474
Do you realize that most people don't have

10:41.558 --> 10:44.060
a personal relationship
with their chlorine dealer?

10:44.144 --> 10:45.937
How crazy is that?

10:46.021 --> 10:47.689
Chris, we got to go
to that apartment building

10:47.772 --> 10:49.357
-and bust Mom and Dad.
-(phone ringing)

10:49.441 --> 10:52.068
I'm on board, Meg,
just got to take this call first.

10:52.152 --> 10:55.071
Christopher's Catamarans.
Been running a side business.

10:55.155 --> 10:56.573
Hello?

10:56.656 --> 10:57.741
Aw, wrong number.

10:57.824 --> 10:59.034
Anyway, Meg, are you happy

10:59.117 --> 11:01.077
with your catamaran supplier?

11:03.663 --> 11:06.791
Shouldn't we be confronting
our parents right now?

11:06.875 --> 11:10.086
I know, it's so crazy
how they moved out of the house.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.130
But you know what's really crazy?

11:12.213 --> 11:15.175
Paying big showroom prices for catamarans.

11:15.258 --> 11:18.261
Meg, do you want to pay
for someone else's brick and mortar?

11:18.345 --> 11:20.388
Or do you want to pay for your own fun

11:20.472 --> 11:22.182
and freedom on the waves?

11:22.265 --> 11:24.476
-I really think that we should be getting back.
-(phone ringing)

11:24.559 --> 11:27.187
Hang on, hang on.
I got to get this call.

11:27.270 --> 11:29.064
Randy's Screen and Window Supply.

11:29.147 --> 11:30.774
That's not another one of my businesses.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.359
I run an answering service.

11:32.442 --> 11:34.486
Although I'd be remiss if I didn't mention

11:34.569 --> 11:37.655
that I am dying to get into
the screen and window business.

11:37.739 --> 11:39.282
If you have an in, Meg,

11:39.366 --> 11:41.659
just anyone in the window game
I could take to coffee,

11:41.743 --> 11:43.661
you know, and just
pick their brains about win...

11:43.745 --> 11:46.081
No, Chris.
I'm sorry, I don't.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.708
Yeah, no, it's cool.
Sorry. I'm still here.

11:48.792 --> 11:51.544
(phone rings)

11:51.628 --> 11:54.798
Windows and Screens Unlimited,
we beat any price.

11:59.636 --> 12:01.471
So, Griffins,

12:01.554 --> 12:04.974
what do you think
of our little oasis in Quahog?

12:05.058 --> 12:06.351
I like it, but I can't believe

12:06.434 --> 12:08.144
we're all going to college next year.

12:08.228 --> 12:09.479
Peter, that's too young.

12:09.562 --> 12:11.564
I mean, have you gotten a reverse mortgage

12:11.648 --> 12:13.983
-like Joe Namath suggests?
-Too old.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.403
KATE: Hey, gang,
there's a new couple moving in.

12:16.486 --> 12:18.738
Look at that, Lois.
We're no longer the new couple.

12:18.822 --> 12:20.073
The heat is off.

12:23.368 --> 12:25.036
-Oh, my God.
-I know.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.414
That's the guy
from the catamaran commercial.

12:32.502 --> 12:35.755
So, you two just moved to the complex?

12:35.839 --> 12:38.008
What did you say your names were again?

12:38.091 --> 12:40.510
I'm Dylan and this is my wife, Dylan.

12:40.593 --> 12:43.763
Oh... same name couple.
That's the dream.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.099
I have an idea, why don't we all
play a board game?

12:46.182 --> 12:47.684
Great idea.

12:47.767 --> 12:50.937
Have you guys ever played
The Wrath of the Star Eclipse:

12:51.021 --> 12:53.356
Empire: Twilight of Destruction?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.067
Wh-What is that?
Is that... is that like Sorry! ?

12:56.151 --> 12:59.237
Um, does Sorry! have a 900-sided die

12:59.320 --> 13:01.197
and its own language of rules?

13:01.281 --> 13:02.782
Oh, we love that game.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.368
Yeah, that sounds like fun.

13:05.452 --> 13:08.038
Why don't you guys set it up,
and we'll get our new friends

13:08.121 --> 13:09.831
drinks from the kitchen, huh?

13:09.914 --> 13:12.417
What the hell do you guys
think you're doing?

13:12.500 --> 13:15.128
I could ask you
the same question, and I shall.

13:15.211 --> 13:17.505
What the hell do you guys
think you're doing?!

13:17.589 --> 13:18.798
I'll tell you what we're doing--

13:18.882 --> 13:21.009
having fun for the first time
in our lives.

13:21.092 --> 13:22.677
And we're not gonna let you ruin that.

13:22.761 --> 13:25.597
Well, we're gonna expose you
as the old farts you are.

13:25.680 --> 13:27.724
Oh, you're gonna expose us?

13:27.807 --> 13:28.850
Did you hear that, Peter?

13:28.933 --> 13:30.518
Don't care, long as you don't pan

13:30.602 --> 13:32.312
no nuggets off me claim.

13:33.480 --> 13:35.065
I went way back.

13:40.028 --> 13:41.780
Okay, Peter, your turn.

13:41.863 --> 13:43.239
Uh...

13:43.323 --> 13:44.866
Why are you looking
at your navigation chart

13:44.949 --> 13:46.159
when we're still at the beginning

13:46.242 --> 13:47.410
of the first build phase?

13:47.494 --> 13:50.163
You know what I like to do
when I play games?

13:50.246 --> 13:52.165
Ask people when they were born.

13:52.248 --> 13:53.500
Pete, you go first.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.669
Oh, that's an easy question. 19...

13:55.752 --> 13:58.046
(stammering)

13:58.129 --> 14:02.759
Uh, uh, nine... 90. 90. 11.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.552
I was born on 9/11.

14:04.636 --> 14:06.262
Well, what about you guys?

14:06.346 --> 14:08.390
You seem like a very happy couple,

14:08.473 --> 14:10.600
yet I haven't seen you even kiss yet.

14:10.684 --> 14:13.144
This is why I said we should've practiced.

14:13.228 --> 14:15.063
I can't kiss at the moment.

14:15.146 --> 14:17.649
I have raging HPV in my throat.

14:17.732 --> 14:20.485
Compliments of m'lady's Florida sojourn.

14:20.568 --> 14:23.154
What a fun Gen Z time we're having.

14:23.238 --> 14:24.739
We should take a photo.

14:24.823 --> 14:28.410
Lois, why don't you take a photo
and AirDrop it to us?

14:30.453 --> 14:33.039
Of course, AirDrop.

14:33.123 --> 14:34.290
That's easy.

14:35.750 --> 14:37.419
(gasps)
Oh, whoops.

14:37.502 --> 14:39.212
Dropped my phone.
(chuckles)

14:39.295 --> 14:41.464
Peter, can you help me pick this up?

14:42.465 --> 14:45.051
What the hell is AirDrop?
Is that Wi-Fi?

14:45.135 --> 14:47.429
-I think it's a medical term for a fart.
-Is that the button you hit

14:47.512 --> 14:49.055
-on the plane?
-I never turn it off on a plane.

14:49.139 --> 14:51.516
-How do you ask Siri?
-I think you mean "celery."

14:51.599 --> 14:53.351
-Hey, celery.
-It's definitely Siri.

14:53.435 --> 14:55.061
-Yeah, I'm wrong.
-Peter, we got to get out of this.

14:55.145 --> 14:56.813
I'll-I'll just throw up,
everyone will have to leave.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.190
-Can you really do that?
-Yeah, I taught myself in sixth grade.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.192
-I'm gonna do it.
-Okay. Okay. I'm in. I'm in.

15:06.197 --> 15:07.949
Aw, gee whiz.

Aw, sorry, guys.
Looks like the party's over.

15:10.493 --> 15:12.328
We'll AirDrop another time.

15:17.709 --> 15:19.127
Ah, Sunday.

15:19.210 --> 15:21.463
Perfect day to dangle my feet in the pool

15:21.546 --> 15:23.381

15:30.889 --> 15:32.557
Bev? Isn't it?

15:32.640 --> 15:34.184
-Uh-huh.
-Well, then say it.

15:34.267 --> 15:37.479
Uh, you guys, the Dylans
just had the best idea.

15:37.562 --> 15:40.065

You think the von Trapps'll stick around

15:46.237 --> 15:47.739

15:47.822 --> 15:50.367
I don't know about them,
but they're gonna have holograms

who I'd never heard of

15:53.536 --> 15:55.497
and then was told to care immensely about.

15:55.580 --> 15:57.582
So, this was the Dylans' idea?

15:57.665 --> 15:59.334
Oh, oh, we can't take credit for it.

15:59.417 --> 16:00.919

I could give up or I could
sneak into a Ramada Inn
