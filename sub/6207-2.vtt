00:12.929 --> 00:14.222
- You did it.
- What?

00:14.388 --> 00:16.682
- Opened the door.
- Lilith was the final seal.

00:16.974 --> 00:20.061
I killed her and I set Lucifer free.

00:33.616 --> 00:36.410
Are you jonesing for another hit
of bitch blood or what?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.788
You're the Michael Sword.

00:38.955 --> 00:40.831
- What do you mean?
- Michael's weapon.

00:40.998 --> 00:42.708
- I'm a vessel?
- You're the vessel.

00:43.709 --> 00:45.253
Rufus Turner. He's a hunter.

00:45.419 --> 00:48.840
I'm what you got to look forward to
if you survive.

00:52.176 --> 00:53.845
We need some help here.

00:56.264 --> 00:58.432
- What the hell was that?
- The Enochian sigil.

00:58.599 --> 01:02.770
It'll hide you from every angel
in creation, including Lucifer.

01:03.104 --> 01:06.440
Ellen, this is my fault.
But Jo did good out there.

01:06.607 --> 01:09.735
- You're angry and I understand.
- Angry doesn't begin to touch it.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.655
Is this about me hunting
or something else?

01:17.159 --> 01:20.413
You chose a demon
over your own brother.

01:20.580 --> 01:23.165
I just don't think I can trust you.

01:32.967 --> 01:37.763
<i>Dr. Adler
to Radiology. Dr. Adler to Radiology.</i>

01:40.892 --> 01:43.227
It been, like, three days now?

01:43.936 --> 01:45.646
We gotta cheer him up.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.940
Maybe I'll give him a back rub.

01:48.107 --> 01:50.443
- Dean.
- Well, what, then?

01:52.987 --> 01:56.490
Look, we might have to wrap our heads
around the idea...

01:56.657 --> 01:59.702
...that Bobby might not just bounce back
this time.

02:03.414 --> 02:05.166
What's in the envelope?

02:06.417 --> 02:09.086
Went down to Radiology,
got some glamour shots.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.633
Let's just say the doctors are baffled.

02:13.799 --> 02:14.884
Holy crap.

02:15.051 --> 02:16.886
Yeah, well, Cass carved you one too.

02:23.059 --> 02:24.477
Hello?

02:24.644 --> 02:25.728
Castiel?

02:26.521 --> 02:28.356
Speak of the devil.

02:28.523 --> 02:30.733
St. Martin's Hospital.
Why, what are you...?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.151
Cass?

02:35.029 --> 02:39.659
<i>Dr. Cohen to ER,
stat. Dr. Cohen to ER, stat.</i>

02:42.328 --> 02:46.207
Cell phone? Since when do angels need
to reach out and touch someone?

02:46.374 --> 02:49.752
You're hidden from angels now.
All angels. I won't be able to simply...

02:49.919 --> 02:51.128
Enough foreplay.

02:51.295 --> 02:53.714
Get over here
and lay your damn hands on.

02:56.300 --> 02:57.552
Get healing.

02:57.718 --> 02:58.845
Now.

02:59.011 --> 03:00.179
I can't.

03:05.935 --> 03:07.270
Say again?

03:07.895 --> 03:09.981
I'm cut off from heaven...

03:10.147 --> 03:12.358
...much of heaven's power.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.944
Certain things I can do,
certain things I can't.

03:15.111 --> 03:18.030
You're telling me you lost your mojo
just in time...

03:18.197 --> 03:21.200
...to get me stuck in this trap
the rest of my life.

03:21.909 --> 03:22.952
I'm sorry.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.872
Shove it up your ass.

03:28.291 --> 03:31.294
- Well, at least he's talking now.
- I heard that.

03:32.420 --> 03:34.797
- Don't have much time. We need to talk.
- Okay.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.674
Your plan to kill Lucifer...

03:36.841 --> 03:39.719
- Yeah, you wanna help?
- No. It's foolish. It can't be done.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.805
- Thanks for the support.
- But I believe I have the solution.

03:42.972 --> 03:46.601
There is someone, besides Michael,
strong enough to take on Lucifer.

03:46.767 --> 03:49.020
Strong enough to stop the apocalypse.

03:49.187 --> 03:50.688
Who's that?

03:50.855 --> 03:53.566
The one who resurrected me
and put you on that airplane.

03:53.733 --> 03:56.068
The one who began everything.

03:56.235 --> 03:57.987
God.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.450
I'm gonna find God.

04:11.626 --> 04:12.877
- God?
- Yes.

04:13.044 --> 04:15.046
- God.
- Yes. He isn't in heaven.

04:15.213 --> 04:16.464
He has to be somewhere.

04:16.630 --> 04:19.382
Try New Mexico.
I hear he's on a tortilla.

04:19.550 --> 04:21.010
No, he's not on any flatbread.

04:22.094 --> 04:25.973
Listen, chuckles, even if there is a God,
he is either dead...

04:26.140 --> 04:28.726
...and that's the generous theory...
- He is out there.

04:28.893 --> 04:32.522
Or he's up and kicking and doesn't
give a rat's ass about any of us.

04:34.315 --> 04:36.901
I mean, look around you.
The world is in the toilet.

04:37.068 --> 04:39.278
We are literally
at the end of days here...

04:39.445 --> 04:42.323
...and he's off somewhere,
drinking booze out of a coconut.

04:42.490 --> 04:43.908
- All right?
- Enough.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.453
This is not a theological issue.
It's strategic.

04:47.620 --> 04:51.123
- With God's help, we can win.
- It's a pipe dream, Cass.

04:51.290 --> 04:53.793
I killed two angels this week.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.878
Those are my brothers. I'm hunted.

04:56.045 --> 04:59.966
I rebelled, and I did it, all
of it, for you, and you failed.

05:00.132 --> 05:03.636
You and your brother destroyed
the world...

05:03.803 --> 05:06.347
...and I lost everything for nothing.

05:08.057 --> 05:12.061
So keep your opinions to yourself.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.316
You didn't drop in
just to tear us a new hole.

05:17.483 --> 05:21.028
- What is it you want?
- I did come for something.

05:21.195 --> 05:22.238
An amulet.

05:22.405 --> 05:23.865
An amulet?

05:24.031 --> 05:27.451
- What kind?
- Very rare. Very powerful.

05:27.618 --> 05:30.580
It burns hot in God's presence.
It'll help me find him.

05:31.539 --> 05:33.291
What, like, God emf?

05:35.960 --> 05:38.254
Well, I don't know.
I got nothing like that.

05:38.421 --> 05:40.590
I know. You don't.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.935
- What? This?
- May I borrow it?

05:53.102 --> 05:54.228
No.

05:54.395 --> 05:56.189
Dean, give it to me.

06:05.698 --> 06:07.658
All right, I guess.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.084
Don't lose it.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.845
Oh, great. Now I feel naked.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.555
I'll be in touch.

06:36.270 --> 06:39.690
When you find God,
tell him to send legs.

06:53.079 --> 06:54.664
Your belt, your belt.

06:58.501 --> 07:00.670
- Aah. Unh.
- Tight, tight. Like this.

07:07.927 --> 07:09.303
<i>- Hello?
- Bobby.</i>

07:09.679 --> 07:11.848
Bobby, damn it, can you hear me?

07:12.014 --> 07:14.809
<i>- I can't hear you.
- Listen, I need a little help.</i>

07:14.976 --> 07:16.978
Seems I'm up to my ass in demons.

07:17.144 --> 07:18.604
Whole damn town's infested.

07:19.021 --> 07:20.773
<i>- Hang on, hang on.
- Where are you?</i>

07:20.940 --> 07:23.651
<i>River Pass, Colorado.</i>

07:23.818 --> 07:25.903
<i>- Colora... Colorado?
- Colorado.</i>

07:26.070 --> 07:28.447
- River Pass, Colorado?
- River Pass.

07:28.614 --> 07:30.324
Rufus?

07:30.491 --> 07:31.951
You there? Rufus.

07:32.118 --> 07:33.661
Bobby, it's...

08:25.463 --> 08:27.089
This is the only road in or out.

08:28.466 --> 08:30.134
No signal.

08:30.468 --> 08:33.095
Rufus was right.
Demons got this place locked down.

08:33.261 --> 08:34.722
Looks like we're hiking in.

08:35.181 --> 08:37.015
And the hits just keep on coming.

09:53.134 --> 09:56.012
<i>Prepare yourself, you know it's a must</i>

09:56.345 --> 10:00.474
<i>Gotta have a friend in Jesus</i>

10:00.641 --> 10:03.603
<i>So you know that when you die</i>

10:49.048 --> 10:51.133
- Ellen?
- Hello, boys.

10:55.262 --> 10:58.140
Ellen, what the heck's going on here?

11:03.812 --> 11:04.939
We're us.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.873
Real glad to see you, boys.

11:28.170 --> 11:30.381
The can of whoop-ass
I ought to open on you.

11:30.547 --> 11:31.799
You can't pick up a phone?

11:31.966 --> 11:34.426
What are you,
allergic to giving me peace of mind?

11:34.843 --> 11:37.054
I gotta find out that you're alive
from Rufus?

11:37.221 --> 11:38.555
- Sorry.
- Yeah, you better be.

11:38.722 --> 11:40.933
You better put me on speed dial, kid.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.268
Yes, ma'am.

11:52.111 --> 11:55.030
- So, what's going on, Ellen?
- More than I can handle alone.

11:55.197 --> 11:57.950
- How many demons are there?
- Pretty much whole town...

11:58.117 --> 12:00.703
...minus the dead people
and these guys.

12:00.953 --> 12:03.789
So this is it, right?

12:03.998 --> 12:05.833
End times.

12:07.459 --> 12:09.503
- It's gotta be.
- Seems like it.

12:14.341 --> 12:15.384
It's me.

12:37.740 --> 12:40.492
This is Sam and Dean.
They're hunters here to help.

12:40.659 --> 12:43.120
You guys hip
to this whole demon thing?

12:43.287 --> 12:44.330
Yeah, are you?

12:44.496 --> 12:46.373
My wife's eyes turned black.

12:46.540 --> 12:47.875
She came at me with a brick.

12:48.042 --> 12:50.502
Kind of makes you embrace
the paranormal.

12:52.796 --> 12:54.298
All right, catch us up.

12:54.465 --> 12:56.133
I doubt I know much more than you.

12:56.300 --> 12:59.720
Rufus called, said he was in town
investigating omens.

12:59.887 --> 13:02.765
The whole town was possessed.
Me and Jo were nearby...

13:02.932 --> 13:04.683
You were hunting with Jo?

13:04.850 --> 13:06.101
Yeah, for a while now.

13:06.477 --> 13:09.563
We got here and the place...
Well, the place was like you see it.

13:09.730 --> 13:12.483
Couldn't find Rufus,
then me and Jo got separated.

13:12.650 --> 13:14.443
I was out looking when I found you.

13:14.610 --> 13:15.945
Don't worry. We'll find her.

13:16.111 --> 13:19.823
Either way, these people cannot just
sit here, we gotta get them out, now.

13:19.990 --> 13:23.244
It's not that easy. I've been trying.
We made a run for it once.

13:23.410 --> 13:26.247
- What happened?
- There used to be 20 of us.

13:32.670 --> 13:35.214
- There's three of us.
- You don't know what it's like.

13:35.381 --> 13:37.716
Demons are everywhere.
We won't cover everybody.

13:37.883 --> 13:39.343
What if we get everyone guns?

13:39.802 --> 13:41.762
Are you gonna arm up baby bump
over here?

13:41.929 --> 13:45.432
More salt we can fire at once,
more demons we can keep away.

13:48.769 --> 13:52.189
There's a store we passed on Main
on the way in. I bet they got guns.

13:53.190 --> 13:56.110
All right. You stay. We'll go.

13:56.277 --> 13:58.362
- What about...?
- If Jo and Rufus are there...

13:58.529 --> 14:00.239
...we'll bring them back.

14:08.455 --> 14:10.249
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

14:10.416 --> 14:11.834
Why don't I just go?

14:12.001 --> 14:13.085
What? Alone?

14:13.252 --> 14:15.879
Somebody's gotta stay,
start giving them Shotgun 101.

14:16.046 --> 14:17.798
- Yeah, Ellen.
- No, no, no.

14:17.965 --> 14:19.758
It'll go faster if you stay and help.

14:19.925 --> 14:22.803
While you go get guns and salt
and look for Jo and Rufus?

14:22.970 --> 14:24.972
- That's stupid.
- I can handle it.

14:28.851 --> 14:31.145
You don't want me going out there.

14:31.312 --> 14:32.980
- I didn't say that.
- Around demons.

14:33.147 --> 14:35.441
- I didn't say that.
- Fine. Then let's go.

14:41.739 --> 14:44.825
- I'll get the salt. You get the guns.
- No, we'll go together.

14:44.992 --> 14:46.285
Dean, it's right there.

14:46.452 --> 14:49.163
Can we at least do this
like professionals?

16:24.008 --> 16:25.259
Sammy?

16:47.773 --> 16:49.858
Okay. All right.

16:50.025 --> 16:53.028
No, hang on a second.
Make sure your thumbs are holding it.

16:53.445 --> 16:56.865
- Oh, sorry, sorry.
- When you're loading a rifle...

16:57.074 --> 16:59.493
...put it down, take it, snap it in.

17:00.994 --> 17:03.413
You know your way around a gun
at all?

17:15.175 --> 17:16.510
Hm.

17:16.676 --> 17:19.179
- Where'd you serve?
- Fallujah.

17:19.346 --> 17:20.848
Two tours.

17:21.013 --> 17:22.891
Got back little over a year ago.

17:23.767 --> 17:24.977
Takes one to know one.

17:25.310 --> 17:27.229
Where'd you serve?

17:27.646 --> 17:29.148
Hell.

17:29.314 --> 17:31.233
Heh. No, seriously.

17:31.650 --> 17:34.069
Seriously. Hell.

17:42.161 --> 17:43.203
Hey.

17:43.370 --> 17:44.830
Hey.

17:49.585 --> 17:50.919
What's wrong?

17:56.008 --> 18:01.430
Just... At the store, those demons
were possessing teenagers.

18:02.181 --> 18:05.768
- I mean, I had to slit some kid's throat.
- Come on, Sam. You had to.

18:05.934 --> 18:08.479
I know. It just... It used to be like...

18:10.230 --> 18:12.983
I just wish I could save people
like I used to.

18:14.943 --> 18:18.238
What do you mean, when you were
all hopped up on demon blood?

18:18.489 --> 18:20.699
- I didn't say that.
- I'll be back.

18:20.866 --> 18:23.202
- Where are you going?
- I can't sit on my ass.

18:23.494 --> 18:26.371
My daughter's out there.
I'm not back in half an hour, go.

18:26.538 --> 18:28.832
- Get these people out of here.
- No, wait.

18:28.999 --> 18:32.377
- I'll go with you.
- Oh, hold on. Can I talk to you for a sec?

18:37.341 --> 18:40.844
- Would you go out there again?
- Crap doesn't hit the fan with breaks.

18:41.303 --> 18:44.223
- I'll go.
- Stay, get them ready. I'll cover Ellen.

18:44.389 --> 18:47.476
- Why does it gotta be you?
- Oh, that's right, I forgot.

18:47.643 --> 18:50.771
You think I'll take one look at a demon
and fall off the wagon...

18:50.938 --> 18:53.732
...as if after everything,
I haven't learned my lesson.

18:54.399 --> 18:55.818
Well, have you?

18:58.695 --> 19:00.614
If you actually think I...

19:16.088 --> 19:17.923
So where'd you see her last?

19:18.090 --> 19:19.842
Up ahead.

19:22.594 --> 19:25.180
So, what's up with you and Dean?

19:26.682 --> 19:31.353
It's hard not to notice how different
things are between you guys these days.

19:33.188 --> 19:34.523
Had a bad road there, huh?

19:34.690 --> 19:37.651
What happened, some girl
come between you or something?

19:37.818 --> 19:41.572
Just stresses of the job.
You know how it is.

19:41.738 --> 19:43.740
Kind of surprised, you and Jo hunting.

19:43.907 --> 19:46.618
Weren't you always saying
she couldn't hack the life?

19:46.785 --> 19:49.872
She can't.
But if she's gonna do it anyway...

19:50.038 --> 19:52.166
You wanna keep an eye on her.

19:53.333 --> 19:54.376
Hey.

19:58.005 --> 20:01.133
- Is that a chimney going?
- Looks like it.

20:01.717 --> 20:03.218
Come on.

20:20.903 --> 20:23.363
Guess we found base camp.

20:27.868 --> 20:30.329
Demons don't get cold.

20:32.206 --> 20:34.625
Makes you wonder
what they're burning.

20:40.506 --> 20:41.840
Don't move, you evil skank.

20:57.064 --> 20:58.774
Don't you hurt her, don't you...

20:58.941 --> 21:01.819
Give me my mom back,
you black-eyed bitch.

21:07.908 --> 21:09.910
Ellen, run!

21:17.876 --> 21:20.629
Got you now, you bastard.

21:46.388 --> 21:48.056
Uh-uh.

21:48.557 --> 21:50.892
No way you're getting out of those.

21:51.059 --> 21:52.644
Did you up myself.

21:54.312 --> 21:57.357
You're stuck right where I want you.

22:00.443 --> 22:02.779
You evil son of a bitch.

22:13.790 --> 22:16.042
No. Wait, wait, wait.

22:16.209 --> 22:18.253
Just... Just wait. No, wait.

22:22.090 --> 22:23.133
Stop.

22:24.551 --> 22:25.594
Please.

22:26.803 --> 22:29.055
The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

22:29.222 --> 22:33.185
He layeth me down in green pastures
and he raiseth me up again.

22:33.351 --> 22:36.646
Though I walk through the valley of the
shadow of death, I shall fear no evil.

22:47.866 --> 22:49.618
Where's Sam?

22:55.790 --> 22:57.042
They took him?

22:57.334 --> 22:58.919
Demons took him?

23:00.420 --> 23:01.463
Oh, my God.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.673
What if they're in here? The demons?

23:03.840 --> 23:06.092
- Could they get in?
- No.

23:07.511 --> 23:10.472
Everybody sit tight, I gotta...

23:23.068 --> 23:25.153
We need to get a plan.
Tell me everything.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.530
Please. Come on.

23:28.073 --> 23:31.660
Look, something's not right.
Do you see that?

23:34.496 --> 23:38.375
Come on. Stop. Listen.

23:47.634 --> 23:48.760
Look. Listen.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.054
- Why isn't it working?
- I don't know.

23:51.513 --> 23:53.765
Look, listen to me.
Something's not right.

23:53.932 --> 23:55.934
He's not as strong as he thinks he is.

23:56.101 --> 23:57.435
You can see that.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.437
Please, please.

23:59.813 --> 24:01.273
Just listen to me.

24:01.439 --> 24:03.066
Dean, one of them's in Jo.

24:03.233 --> 24:05.527
We gotta get it out
without hurting her.

24:06.027 --> 24:07.612
It called me a bitch.

24:09.114 --> 24:12.617
- Bruising a little easy, don't you think?
- Oh, it's not what I meant.

24:12.784 --> 24:14.452
It called me a black-eyed bitch.

24:16.246 --> 24:19.416
What kind of demons are these?
Holy water and salt roll right off.

24:19.583 --> 24:21.668
My daughter may be an idiot,
but not stupid.

24:21.835 --> 24:24.296
She wears an anti-possession charm.

24:26.590 --> 24:28.675
It's all kind of weird, right?

24:28.884 --> 24:30.093
The whole thing's off.

24:30.260 --> 24:33.054
- What's your instinct?
- My instinct?

24:33.221 --> 24:35.932
My instinct is to call Bobby
and ask for help or Sam.

24:36.099 --> 24:39.811
Well, tough. All you got's me
and all I got's you. So let's figure it out.

24:40.979 --> 24:42.022
All right.

24:45.025 --> 24:48.236
Do you know why Rufus came to town?
Was there a specific omen?

24:48.403 --> 24:51.406
He said something about water.
That's all I know.

24:52.032 --> 24:55.285
Padre, you know what
she's talking about? The water?

24:56.244 --> 24:59.080
The river ran polluted, all of a sudden.

24:59.247 --> 25:00.624
When?

25:00.790 --> 25:03.877
Last Wednesday.
The demon thing started up next day.

25:05.003 --> 25:07.422
Anything else? Anything?

25:09.174 --> 25:11.843
- Maybe, but it's pretty random.
- Good, random's good.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.803
Shooting star. Does that count?

25:14.513 --> 25:16.932
Real big. Same night, Wednesday.

25:18.934 --> 25:21.102
Well, that definitely counts.

25:29.861 --> 25:33.031
So you think that all this comes
from outer space?

25:33.198 --> 25:35.408
<i>This isn't X- Files, pal.</i>

25:39.663 --> 25:43.250
"And there fell a great star from heaven,
burning like a torch...

25:43.416 --> 25:47.128
...and it fell upon the river, and the name
of the star was Wormwood.

25:47.295 --> 25:48.630
And many men died."

25:48.797 --> 25:50.173
Revelation 8:10.

25:50.340 --> 25:54.010
Are you saying
that this is about the apocalypse?

25:55.345 --> 25:57.180
You could say.

25:57.347 --> 25:59.558
These specific omens,
they're prelude to what?

25:59.724 --> 26:00.809
The four horsemen.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.436
- And which one rides the red horse?
- War.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.857
That cherry Mustang parked on main?

26:07.023 --> 26:10.110
- You can't think that a car is...
- It's the way I'd roll.

26:12.070 --> 26:14.155
I mean, think about it.

26:14.865 --> 26:16.032
It all makes sense.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.411
If War's a dude and he's here,
maybe he's messing with our heads.

26:19.578 --> 26:22.497
- Turning us on each other.
- Jo called you a black-eyed bitch.

26:23.582 --> 26:25.917
They think we're demons.
We think they're demons.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.253
What if there are no demons?
We're killing each other.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.921
Wait, just back up.

26:30.255 --> 26:31.840
It's the apocalypse?

26:32.382 --> 26:33.550
Sorry, Padre.

26:44.644 --> 26:45.812
Who the hell are you?

26:48.899 --> 26:50.233
What are you?

26:51.610 --> 26:52.652
You caught me.

26:52.819 --> 26:54.529
Popped in to watch.

26:54.696 --> 26:56.948
I can hustle like that.

26:58.283 --> 27:00.577
The Roger everyone here knows,
the real Roger?

27:00.911 --> 27:02.120
Buried in a ditch.

27:03.872 --> 27:05.165
Hm.

27:09.127 --> 27:10.837
So who are you?

27:13.590 --> 27:15.300
Here's a hint:

27:15.467 --> 27:20.722
I was in Germany, then in Germany,
then in the Middle East.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.767
I was in Darfur
when my beeper went off.

27:24.226 --> 27:26.102
I'm waiting to hook up
with my siblings.

27:26.269 --> 27:28.688
I've got three.

27:28.855 --> 27:30.649
We're gonna have so much fun
together.

27:34.694 --> 27:36.780
I know who you are.

27:38.031 --> 27:39.658
There aren't any demons in town.

27:39.825 --> 27:43.620
Nope. Just frightened people
ripping each other's throats out.

27:43.787 --> 27:45.038
I haven't had to do much.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.792
I mean, take out a bridge here,
lay in a little hallucination there...

27:48.959 --> 27:52.420
...sit back, pop some corn,
watch the show.

27:52.587 --> 27:57.050
Frankly, you are a really vicious
little animal, Sam.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.260
No.

27:58.426 --> 27:59.469
You're doing this.

27:59.636 --> 28:02.347
Please. Last week, this was Mayberry.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.516
People are stabbing
each other's children.

28:04.683 --> 28:05.976
You made them see demons.

28:06.142 --> 28:09.104
Honestly, people don't need a reason
to kill each other.

28:09.271 --> 28:11.022
I mean, you seen the Irish?

28:11.189 --> 28:12.232
They're all Irish.

28:16.319 --> 28:18.488
You think I'm a monster.

28:18.655 --> 28:21.533
I'm Jell-O shots at a party.
I just remove inhibitions.

28:21.783 --> 28:23.034
I'm gonna kill you myself.

28:23.201 --> 28:26.788
Oh, that's adorable,
considering you're my poster boy.

28:28.999 --> 28:30.917
And what's that supposed to mean?

28:31.543 --> 28:33.753
You can't stop thinking about it.

28:33.920 --> 28:37.632
Ever since you saw it
dripping off the blade of that knife.

28:38.592 --> 28:41.720
- You're wrong.
- Save your protests for your brother.

28:42.762 --> 28:46.975
I can see inside your head
and, man, it is one-track city in there.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.020
Blood, blood, blood.

28:56.818 --> 28:58.445
Lust...

28:58.612 --> 28:59.988
...for power.

29:00.155 --> 29:01.448
Same as always.

29:01.823 --> 29:03.366
You wanna be strong again...

29:03.533 --> 29:05.535
...but not just strong.

29:05.994 --> 29:08.121
Stronger than everybody.

29:08.872 --> 29:12.959
Good intentions, quick slide to hell,
buddy boy.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.172
You feel bad now?

29:17.339 --> 29:19.716
Wait till you're thigh-deep
in warm corpses.

29:21.426 --> 29:23.470
Because, my friend...

29:23.762 --> 29:25.180
...I'm just getting started.

29:35.857 --> 29:37.817
Showtime for the meat suits.

29:37.984 --> 29:39.110
Watch this.

29:55.252 --> 29:57.420
- He did it.
- No.

29:57.587 --> 30:00.298
He said they're coming.
He said they're coming to get us.

30:00.465 --> 30:02.592
Stop, Jo. Rufus, he's lying. No.

30:02.759 --> 30:05.011
- You shut your mouth.
- Please. Jo, he's lying.

30:06.388 --> 30:10.725
So now you're saying that there
are no demons and that War is a guy.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.227
You believed crazy before...

30:13.812 --> 30:16.064
Open up, man! Open up! It's Roger!

30:19.276 --> 30:20.944
I saw them.

30:21.111 --> 30:24.114
The demons.
They know we're trying to leave.

30:24.281 --> 30:27.701
- They said they're gonna pick us off.
- Wait, wait, wait. What?

30:27.868 --> 30:30.328
- You said there were no demons.
- Where did you go?

30:30.495 --> 30:33.915
- I thought someone should go out.
- Where? What did they say exactly?

30:34.082 --> 30:36.084
- We sit here, we're gonna be dead.
- No.

30:36.251 --> 30:38.837
They're gonna kill us
unless we kill them first.

30:39.004 --> 30:41.381
- Okay, hold on.
- No, we got people to protect.

30:41.548 --> 30:44.342
All right, the able-bodied go,
hunt some demons.

30:44.509 --> 30:47.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa, slow your roll.
This is not a demon thing.

30:51.516 --> 30:54.102
Look at their eyes. They're demons.

31:00.192 --> 31:01.693
Go, go, go.

31:04.154 --> 31:05.572
Move!

31:13.921 --> 31:17.008
- Those are real.
- They could've been demons all the time.

31:17.300 --> 31:22.054
All this salt and holy water talk,
as far as I'm concerned, it's crap.

31:23.180 --> 31:24.307
Are you sure?

31:25.558 --> 31:26.600
It's them or us.

31:27.810 --> 31:31.022
- I think I saw some knives in the kitchen.
- Great.

31:31.188 --> 31:32.732
Go.

31:43.117 --> 31:45.536
- Hey, Rufus.
- Yeah?

31:45.703 --> 31:49.206
- Pipe bombs won't kill a demon.
- Right.

31:50.207 --> 31:52.668
But in my experience...

31:53.961 --> 31:58.215
...demons come at you slower
if they're in a body with no limbs.

31:58.382 --> 32:00.176
One of them is in my mother.

32:03.929 --> 32:06.849
Jo, listen to me.
You know I'm gonna do everything I can.

32:07.016 --> 32:08.684
Your mom's gonna be okay.

32:10.770 --> 32:13.272
Unless she comes through
that window.

32:28.162 --> 32:29.997
All right, let's move.

32:30.164 --> 32:32.458
Stay low, move fast.

33:20.548 --> 33:21.882
- Unh.
- Rufus!

33:28.597 --> 33:31.600
Now, you listen up,
Joanna Beth Harvelle.

33:35.855 --> 33:38.149
Listen to me. I am not a demon.

33:38.316 --> 33:41.485
- Think, Rufus. All those omens.
- You go to hell.

33:49.118 --> 33:50.161
Rufus.

33:50.328 --> 33:53.623
The polluted water, the shooting star,
the red Mustang?

33:53.789 --> 33:56.083
It's War. I'm telling you, it's War.

33:56.250 --> 33:57.710
You're damn right it is.

34:05.134 --> 34:06.260
The horseman.

34:06.552 --> 34:07.845
- Horseman?
- Yes.

34:08.012 --> 34:10.806
He's turning us against each other.
You're hallucinating.

34:16.145 --> 34:18.773
Horseman. War.

34:18.938 --> 34:20.065
Yes.

34:21.984 --> 34:24.277
Did you figure this out
all by yourself, genius?

34:34.205 --> 34:35.581
Whoa, whoa.

34:37.583 --> 34:38.833
We all on the same page?

34:40.418 --> 34:42.505
Good. Hi, Jo.

34:43.130 --> 34:44.507
Hey.

34:44.674 --> 34:45.882
Okay.

34:46.050 --> 34:47.802
We gotta find War
before everybody in...

34:51.847 --> 34:52.974
Damn it.

34:53.139 --> 34:54.266
- Where's Sam?
- Upstairs.

34:57.853 --> 35:01.524
All right. You three go around back.
Take the alley.

35:03.985 --> 35:05.528
Dean, it's not demons.

35:05.695 --> 35:06.946
- It's War.
- It's War. Yes.

35:07.113 --> 35:10.282
- I just can't figure out how he's doing it.
- The ring.

35:10.449 --> 35:12.034
The ring. The ring!

35:12.201 --> 35:15.746
He turned it before he made everybody
hallucinate me going hell-bitch.

35:17.957 --> 35:19.375
We gotta move. Come on.

35:41.022 --> 35:42.940
People, cease fire!

35:43.316 --> 35:46.319
Stop shooting! Stop!

35:48.237 --> 35:50.072
I'm getting too old for this.

35:57.872 --> 35:59.624
Father!

36:00.833 --> 36:02.710
Oh, my God!

36:05.296 --> 36:06.589
Help.

36:06.756 --> 36:09.967
I'm not what you think, honey.
Come on. Here. Put this right here.

36:15.056 --> 36:18.851
"Stop firing"
usually means stop firing.

36:32.406 --> 36:33.783
Back.

36:56.681 --> 36:59.183
Whoa. Okay.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.602
That's a sweet little knife,
but come on.

37:01.769 --> 37:04.230
You can't kill War, kiddos.

37:04.397 --> 37:05.481
Oh, we know.

37:18.577 --> 37:19.662
Come on.

37:52.010 --> 37:53.470
So pit stop on Mount Doom?

38:03.130 --> 38:04.256
- Dean...
- Sam, let's not.

38:04.423 --> 38:06.591
No, listen. This is important.

38:07.467 --> 38:08.718
I know you don't trust me.

38:09.636 --> 38:12.222
Just... Now I realize something.

38:14.808 --> 38:16.101
I don't trust me either.

38:17.644 --> 38:21.148
From the minute I saw that blood,
the only thought in my head...

38:24.776 --> 38:28.530
And I tell myself
it's for the right reasons.

38:28.697 --> 38:32.784
My intentions are good
and it feels true, you know?

38:33.076 --> 38:34.828
But I think underneath...

38:37.122 --> 38:39.291
...I just miss the feeling.

38:41.001 --> 38:43.044
I know how messed up that sounds...

38:43.211 --> 38:46.256
...which means I know
how messed up I am.

38:47.632 --> 38:49.843
Thing is,
the problem's not the demon blood.

38:50.010 --> 38:54.765
Not really. I mean, I... What I did?
I can't blame the blood or Ruby...

38:55.348 --> 38:56.892
...or anything.

38:59.728 --> 39:01.313
The problem's me.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.691
How far I'll go.

39:07.861 --> 39:09.863
There's something in me that...

39:12.407 --> 39:14.701
...scares the hell out of me, Dean.

39:14.868 --> 39:17.788
In the last couple days,
I caught another glimpse.

39:21.416 --> 39:22.626
So, what are you saying?

39:24.169 --> 39:25.962
I'm in no shape to be hunting.

39:26.963 --> 39:30.634
I need to step back
because I'm dangerous.

39:33.720 --> 39:37.849
Maybe it's best we just go
our separate ways.

39:43.063 --> 39:44.397
Well, I think you're right.

39:49.569 --> 39:50.737
I was expecting a fight.

39:50.904 --> 39:53.615
Truth is, I spend more time worrying
about you...

39:54.032 --> 39:56.660
...than about doing the job right.

39:57.869 --> 40:00.288
I just... I can't afford that, you know?

40:00.455 --> 40:02.207
Not now.

40:07.504 --> 40:08.588
I'm sorry, Dean.

40:08.755 --> 40:10.966
I know you are, Sam.

40:19.474 --> 40:20.976
Hey, uh...

40:23.979 --> 40:25.772
...you wanna take the Impala?

40:28.275 --> 40:29.443
That's okay.

40:43.165 --> 40:44.833
Take care of yourself, Dean.

40:47.127 --> 40:49.254
Yeah, you too, Sammy.
