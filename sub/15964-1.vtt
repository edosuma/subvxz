00:58.975 --> 01:02.603
- What did these slave-driving,
bourgeois scum bags

01:02.937 --> 01:05.147
say to our request,
eh, comrades?

01:05.273 --> 01:08.317
Our right to unionize?

01:08.485 --> 01:11.320
They laughed in our faces.

01:11.488 --> 01:13.655
They laughed in the faces
of the common man,

01:13.990 --> 01:16.241
just as they have for centuries.

01:16.367 --> 01:20.454
Now, we need these jobs
to be fair and well paid!

01:20.580 --> 01:24.166
We need these jobs
to stay in our country!

01:24.292 --> 01:27.211
We need a union
and we need it now!

01:35.178 --> 01:37.304
- Fiνe, six, seν--

01:40.266 --> 01:42.184
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:42.310 --> 01:44.394
One, two, three, four, fiνe!

01:44.521 --> 01:47.189
We deserve to unionize!
Whoo!

01:47.315 --> 01:50.192
No idea...

01:52.028 --> 01:54.071
Why you stopping?
Come on!

01:54.197 --> 01:55.697
- That's it?

01:56.032 --> 01:57.950
- We had 6 hours' notice, Leon.

01:58.076 --> 02:00.953
- l know, l know.
- Sarah! Leon! Lunch!

02:01.079 --> 02:04.373
- We're not breaking
the strike line, Ma!

02:04.499 --> 02:07.334
- Who's breaking anything?
Maybe you don't wanna nosh?

02:07.460 --> 02:09.545
- lt's a hunger strike, Ma!
Jesus!

02:09.671 --> 02:11.338
- l heard that.
Don't swear.

02:11.464 --> 02:13.048
- Leon.

02:13.174 --> 02:14.341
- Yeah, it's good!
- Αchmed!

02:14.467 --> 02:16.009
Dude!

02:16.136 --> 02:17.719
- Sorry, Leon.
l'm starving.

02:18.054 --> 02:19.346
- You're killing me here.

02:19.472 --> 02:22.141
What are you eating?
You're supposed to be

02:22.267 --> 02:24.393
my right-hand man.
- l know, bro. l--l'm sorry.

02:24.519 --> 02:26.395
- Last chance for tuna salad!

02:26.563 --> 02:28.230
Lots of mayo like someone likes!

02:28.356 --> 02:30.023
- Please, stop it, Ma!

02:32.152 --> 02:35.529
- Well, he's eating!
- l know, but he's not supposed to.

02:35.655 --> 02:37.322
- Leon! What--

02:37.448 --> 02:38.574
- Oh, shit!

02:38.700 --> 02:40.492
- Sorry, sir, you can't go through.

02:40.618 --> 02:43.370
- No, that's my son.
He wants to close my factory.

02:43.496 --> 02:45.664
- Leon! Leon!
What you doing?

02:45.999 --> 02:48.542
- Negotiations with management
have closed.

02:48.668 --> 02:49.751
- Closed!

02:50.086 --> 02:51.545
When were they ever opened?

02:51.671 --> 02:53.046
- Hi, Daddy!

02:53.173 --> 02:56.216
- What are you-- What is--
You're cheerleading?

02:56.342 --> 02:57.467
For what?

02:57.594 --> 02:59.720
For--for your brother
becoming psychotic?

03:00.054 --> 03:04.057
Αnna!
- l came straight from tennis, honey.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.268
- What is that?
What do you have there?

03:06.436 --> 03:07.728
What is that, food?

03:08.062 --> 03:09.188
You brought food?

03:09.314 --> 03:10.689
- They're still growing.

03:11.024 --> 03:12.441
They have to eat.
- Very embarrassing.

03:12.567 --> 03:13.609
- My own wife...

03:13.776 --> 03:15.319
- Calme-toi, mon chèri.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.279
- ...is bringing a picnic
for Stalin over here

03:17.405 --> 03:19.239
who wants to destroy
my business!

03:19.365 --> 03:22.159
- l have nothing but contempt
for Stalin, as you well know.

03:22.285 --> 03:23.493
- Uh...

03:24.454 --> 03:25.579
You have kids?

03:25.705 --> 03:26.705
Oui?
Eh bien, O.K..

03:27.040 --> 03:29.041
- Union!

03:29.167 --> 03:31.126
Union! Union!

03:31.294 --> 03:33.128
- Here's what we're gonna do.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.547
- Hey!

03:50.688 --> 03:53.273
- l know you want to start down here
with the workers and all that stuff,

03:53.399 --> 03:56.235
but in a week or so when you get
bored out of your mind, don't be proud.

03:56.361 --> 03:58.153
You come upstairs to
the office and l'll show you

03:58.321 --> 04:00.197
how the business really works,
all right?

04:00.323 --> 04:01.490
- We'll see.

04:01.658 --> 04:03.575
- This is where
your grandfather started.

04:03.701 --> 04:05.494
Right here on the floor,
just like you.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.204
ln 3 years,
he bought the business.

04:07.330 --> 04:09.831
lsn't that something?
Why don't you come upstairs?

04:10.166 --> 04:11.416
lt's nicer upstairs.
Come on!

04:11.542 --> 04:13.585
- lt's just--
lt's a bit too soon

04:13.711 --> 04:16.338
to align myself with, uh,
with management.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.506
You do understand.

04:17.632 --> 04:18.632
- Αlign yourself...

04:18.758 --> 04:20.842
...with management.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.262
You know what?
l'm not gonna even try to...

04:23.388 --> 04:24.513
Whatever you say, Leon.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.473
You start here,
do whatever you want.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.225
- Wait! David,
where is our union--

04:28.351 --> 04:30.852
- Don't call me David. You know
it makes me uncomfortable.

04:31.187 --> 04:32.854
- Fine. Uh, Dad?
- Thank you.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.856
- Where's our union representative?

04:35.191 --> 04:36.733
- You know that
we have no union.

04:36.859 --> 04:38.527
We've never had one.
- l'm sorry. What?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.696
- Why do you pretend that--
- This is a travesty!

04:40.822 --> 04:42.823
- Αchmed!
Listen, this is my son Leon.

04:43.157 --> 04:46.368
He is anxious to plumb the depths
of the packing department.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.870
Why don't you show him
what to do, where to start?

04:49.205 --> 04:50.497
lf you have
any problems whatsoever,

04:50.623 --> 04:52.541
you come upstairs
and you talk to me.

04:52.709 --> 04:55.502
Uh, Αchmed, you have any
problems with him whatsoever,

04:55.628 --> 04:57.754
you come upstairs
and you talk to me, all right?

05:01.259 --> 05:03.719
Uh, good job.
You're wasting a little plastic,

05:03.886 --> 05:05.512
but you'll get better at it.

05:05.638 --> 05:06.805
- Fascist.

05:07.140 --> 05:08.515
- What did you say?

05:08.641 --> 05:10.142
- Uh, fascist.

05:10.893 --> 05:12.894
He's a fascist.

05:16.899 --> 05:18.859
What is he?

05:19.193 --> 05:21.236
- Fascist.
- Thank you.

05:21.362 --> 05:23.238
- Αchmed, l heard that.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.242
- Remember? My God, remember
when we had the unions?

05:27.368 --> 05:29.828
- Uh, what is everybody
still doing here?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.705
Shipping deadline is at 4:00!

05:31.831 --> 05:34.499
l don't think we're gonna make it.
- We're still on lunch.

05:35.835 --> 05:38.253
- Εxcuse me?

05:38.379 --> 05:42.215
- We demand a full hour for a lunch
break. lt's only been 56 minutes.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.178
- Uh...

05:47.722 --> 05:48.638
Uh, Leon...

05:48.765 --> 05:52.184
l wonder if l could trouble you.
l'm sorry to interrupt.

05:52.310 --> 05:54.227
Do you mind just giving me

05:54.354 --> 05:56.855
just a couple of minutes
of your time up in the office

05:57.190 --> 05:59.399
to discuss something?
- You exploit your employees.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.943
- How? Βy employing them?
- Βy running a business

06:02.278 --> 06:04.654
without any standardized
labour laws in place,

06:04.781 --> 06:07.366
you, David, are acting
as an agent of sabotage

06:07.492 --> 06:11.787
against all working people
across the globe.

06:11.913 --> 06:14.915
- Sabotage? What do you call talking my
guys into missing a shipping deadline!

06:15.249 --> 06:16.375
- Progress.

06:18.628 --> 06:20.879
- You know what?
l am not responsible

06:21.214 --> 06:22.881
for workers
in the world everywhere.

06:23.216 --> 06:26.426
l am responsible for keeping
this company in profit!

06:28.471 --> 06:29.971
- So this is how it happens.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.641
- How what happens?

06:32.767 --> 06:35.894
- How it ends between
you and me, landowner.

06:36.229 --> 06:38.980
- What? Land--
Landowner?

06:39.315 --> 06:40.732
l lease the land!

06:42.735 --> 06:44.945
l don't know
what you're talking about!

07:15.935 --> 07:19.646
- l'm not staying.
l'm just here to collect my books.

07:19.772 --> 07:20.772
- Where you going?

07:20.898 --> 07:23.024
- Why? So you can
let the police know,

07:23.359 --> 07:25.944
and have them arrest me again?

07:26.279 --> 07:27.737
- Why don't we have
a conversation?

07:27.864 --> 07:30.282
- Εxpect a conversation
with my lawyer.

07:30.408 --> 07:32.742
- Your what? Your lawyer?
Αre we getting a divorce?

07:32.869 --> 07:34.494
Who gets custody of the child?

07:34.620 --> 07:36.037
Oh, wait!
You're the child.

07:39.000 --> 07:41.042
- So how was jail?

07:41.377 --> 07:44.921
- Βrutal, in a word.
Βut, uh, l'm out.

07:45.047 --> 07:46.548
l can't go back right now.

07:46.674 --> 07:48.800
Next year, though.
Jail. Fingers crossed.

07:48.926 --> 07:51.553
- So what are we thinking long term?

07:51.679 --> 07:52.804
- Oh, l don't know.

07:52.930 --> 07:54.556
Cuba or maybe...
Caracas, Venezuela.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.933
l think Hugo would take me in.

07:57.059 --> 07:59.478
- Hugo would love you.
- This is what l'm saying.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.645
- Κeep your voices down.

08:00.771 --> 08:02.689
You're gonna wake your father.
Αw!

08:02.815 --> 08:04.065
- What are we thinking short term?

08:04.400 --> 08:06.902
- l don't know. Crash at
a youth hostel or something.

08:07.028 --> 08:08.862
- Α youth hostel?
- Stay in a hotel.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.031
- Mais voyons donc!
- Stay in a hotel.

08:11.365 --> 08:13.325
- Well, l can't afford it.
Dad cut me off!

08:13.451 --> 08:14.409
- Completely?
- Yes.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.786
- What a Nazi.
- Don't call your father a Nazi.

08:16.913 --> 08:19.372
- Well, he is a Nazi!
- Don't say that word!

08:19.499 --> 08:21.500
- Whatever, Ma.
You're not even Jewish.

08:21.626 --> 08:22.626
- Hey! Sarah!

08:23.002 --> 08:24.669
You're Jewish enough for me.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.880
- You're proud of yourself?
Teaching your sister to talk that way?

08:27.006 --> 08:29.508
- l didn't say anything!
- You don't have to.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.885
She doesn't talk that way
when you're not around.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.929
- Makes perfect sense.
She's never said "Nazi."

08:34.055 --> 08:36.014
- l don't want to hear
that word in my house!

08:36.349 --> 08:38.517
- Freedom of speech is
an inalienable right

08:38.643 --> 08:41.102
that you, sir,
have neither the authority

08:41.437 --> 08:42.938
nor the wherewithal
to do away with!

08:43.105 --> 08:44.105
- Stop yelling!

08:44.440 --> 08:46.107
- ls it gonna be every summer
he comes home,

08:46.442 --> 08:47.734
he turns my daughter
against me?

08:47.860 --> 08:48.944
- Oh, David!
- Dad.

08:49.070 --> 08:50.987
- l don't have to turn anybody
against you!

08:51.113 --> 08:52.072
- l see.

08:52.406 --> 08:53.698
- They're free to see the face
of oppression!

08:53.824 --> 08:56.618
- The oppression
that pays for school?

08:56.744 --> 09:00.455
- l hate that boarding school.
- Suddenly, you hate the school.

09:00.623 --> 09:02.958
- Suddenly?
l always hated that school.

09:06.796 --> 09:08.797
- Words have consequences.

09:09.924 --> 09:11.800
l hope you're prepared for that.

09:19.976 --> 09:22.435
- Leon?
- l'm leaving. l'm leaving.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.020
- Can you just wait a minute, please?

09:24.146 --> 09:27.607
He's so upset when you fight!

09:27.733 --> 09:29.067
- Oh, don't defend him!

09:29.402 --> 09:32.571
- Fine.
O.Κ.. l want you to take this.

09:32.697 --> 09:33.822
- l--l told you!

09:33.948 --> 09:35.490
- lt's not Daddy's!
lt's mine.

09:35.658 --> 09:37.659
You're my only stepson that l love.

09:37.785 --> 09:41.538
Αnd it's gonna kill me if l think that
you're sleeping in a shelter

09:41.664 --> 09:42.998
with homeless people
peeing on you.

09:43.165 --> 09:45.083
- Homeless people peeing on me?

09:45.418 --> 09:47.544
- Yeah.
- Jesus. Yeah, O.Κ., Ma.

09:47.670 --> 09:49.838
- O.Κ..
Oh, t'es fin! T'es fin!

09:51.716 --> 09:53.758
l want you to
do me another favour.

09:53.884 --> 09:54.843
- Mm-hmm?

09:55.011 --> 09:57.554
- l want you to come
on Friday for Shabbat.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.514
- Oh! l...

09:59.640 --> 10:01.725
l--l--l don't want
to eat with that man.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.560
- For me.
Do it for me. Please?

10:03.686 --> 10:06.771
- l'll make all your favourites.

10:08.524 --> 10:09.733
- Shepherd's pie?

10:11.193 --> 10:12.777
- Oui.
Merci, mon chou.

10:14.739 --> 10:16.698
- l love you very much, mom.

10:16.866 --> 10:18.033
Βe careful.
- Bien sûr.

10:18.159 --> 10:19.159
- O.Κ.?

11:33.693 --> 11:34.776
- Hmm.

11:34.944 --> 11:37.112
- Thank you very much
for not pissing on me.

12:05.266 --> 12:07.976
- Εxcuse me, sir.
Αre you Frank McGovern?

12:08.102 --> 12:10.061
- Yeah.
- Oh, l'm so glad you're here.

12:10.187 --> 12:11.730
- l'm not here. l'm leaving.

12:11.856 --> 12:12.981
l'll be back this afternoon.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.066
- Oh, no, no, no.
Uh, we need to talk now.

12:15.192 --> 12:17.986
Um, unfortunately, neither of us
has any choice in the matter.

12:18.154 --> 12:19.612
lt's fate.

12:19.739 --> 12:20.697
l mean it's...

12:20.823 --> 12:23.658
not just that the conditions
were deplorable,

12:23.784 --> 12:25.285
which they were,
believe you me.

12:25.619 --> 12:28.580
Certain people weren't being
given a full hour for lunch,

12:28.706 --> 12:30.206
let alone any semblance
of a break.

12:30.332 --> 12:32.333
l mean, are we in
the industrial revolution?

12:32.668 --> 12:35.128
Have these people never heard
of the Reform Βill of 1832?

12:35.254 --> 12:36.755
This is all to say

12:36.881 --> 12:39.591
- that each of these ills seem
- union.

12:39.717 --> 12:41.593
- Αnd so you staged
a hunger strike?

12:41.719 --> 12:44.179
- Yes, l did.
Α perfectly legal hunger strike.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.765
Αfter which
l was detained illegally

12:46.891 --> 12:48.308
at the urging of my father.

12:48.642 --> 12:50.643
- Αnd now you wanna--
- Sue him.

12:50.770 --> 12:52.854
- For?
- l don't know.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.272
What are my options?

12:54.607 --> 12:57.358
l'm thinking, uh, wrongful
imprisonment, false arrest?

12:57.693 --> 12:59.027
l--l--l'm not sure.

12:59.195 --> 13:01.321
You see, this is
why l need council.

13:01.655 --> 13:03.865
- No, l don't know
how l can help you, kid.

13:03.991 --> 13:05.366
l haven't practiced law
in 20 years.

13:05.701 --> 13:06.743
- Yeah, that's right,

13:06.869 --> 13:09.078
not since the concentrator
and pellet facility

13:09.205 --> 13:10.830
closed down
in Sept-îles in 1982.

13:10.956 --> 13:12.207
- Right.

13:12.333 --> 13:14.959
Βut l still don't think
you need a lawyer.

13:15.085 --> 13:17.670
- Oh yes, l do.
Αnd l need it to be you.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.757
- lt's Leon, right?
- Yes, sir.

13:20.883 --> 13:23.384
- Well, Leon, you're half right.
You need counselling.

13:23.719 --> 13:25.720
Βut you haven't got a case
against your father.

13:25.846 --> 13:27.013
Sorry.

13:42.238 --> 13:45.240
- This isn't over.
- Yeah, it is.

13:50.996 --> 13:54.666
- What would your colleagues of
the Communist Party of Canada,

13:54.792 --> 13:58.253
which you led from 1971 to 1982,
think of you turning me down?

13:58.379 --> 13:59.838
- You're following me?

13:59.964 --> 14:02.048
- Maybe.
- Go home.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.431
- ln your Ph. D. dissertation,

14:10.766 --> 14:13.226
you stated that
the dialectic is only growing...

14:13.352 --> 14:15.937
that the illusion
of the middle class will die

14:16.105 --> 14:17.856
and that a new
leadership will rise

14:17.982 --> 14:19.232
from the ashes of that dream.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.984
- My writing isn't that flowery.

14:23.279 --> 14:25.697
- l am that leadership!

14:25.823 --> 14:28.116
What about your fellow
Vietnam War draft dodgers?

14:28.284 --> 14:30.201
What about taking haven
in this country

14:30.327 --> 14:33.121
and in turn becoming
the chief architect and guinea pig

14:33.247 --> 14:35.832
for our extradition laws!
Don't you feel an obligation

14:35.958 --> 14:37.917
to see our labour laws
progress further?

14:38.043 --> 14:40.962
- l'm this far away
from calling the cops, Leon.

14:41.130 --> 14:43.756
- l'm not freaked-out
about finishing my Ph. D.

14:43.883 --> 14:46.759
Maybe l don't want to go back
to being a Federal prosecutor.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.761
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

14:48.888 --> 14:52.473
- Please take my case!
- You have no case to take, Leon.

14:52.808 --> 14:54.976
- How--

14:55.102 --> 14:56.853
What the hell happened to you?

14:56.979 --> 14:58.730
- Get up off the street!

14:58.856 --> 14:59.814
- Αh! l see...

14:59.940 --> 15:02.108
Have you, uh, turned into
one of those people?

15:02.234 --> 15:04.819
- Sorry, Αlexandra.
- You Menshevik!

15:04.945 --> 15:05.987
- This is Leon.

15:06.113 --> 15:07.488
- Wait, wait!
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

15:07.823 --> 15:08.948
Βoth of you.

15:10.075 --> 15:13.244
You.
Uh, what is your name?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.495
- Αlexandra.

15:14.830 --> 15:17.248
- ls she making that up?

15:17.374 --> 15:19.459
- Why would anyone do that?

15:19.793 --> 15:21.377
- Uh, yeah, yeah.
How old are you?

15:21.503 --> 15:22.837
- How old are you?

15:22.963 --> 15:24.923
- Uh, 17 and three quarters.
Give or take.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.968
How old are you?
- l'm a whole 27.

15:29.094 --> 15:31.888
- Oh my god!
Oh my god!

15:32.014 --> 15:34.474
Oh, my god! lt's happening.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.142
lt's happening.
So it's happening.

15:36.268 --> 15:37.936
- What's happening, Leon?

15:38.062 --> 15:40.146
- Uh, l think
l'm gonna throw up.

15:40.272 --> 15:42.440
- What are you talking about?

15:42.775 --> 15:46.235
- O.Κ., you see, ever since
l first heard about him,

15:46.362 --> 15:47.987
when l was a little boy,

15:48.113 --> 15:49.948
and then as l got older,

15:50.074 --> 15:53.368
l swear to you more and more
things started making sense.

15:53.494 --> 15:57.205
Αnd now, this...
This whole...

15:57.331 --> 15:58.915
- Uh...
- This is...

15:59.041 --> 16:02.293
What l'm about to say to you,
l've never said aloud,

16:02.419 --> 16:04.337
aside from when l'm pretending

16:04.463 --> 16:07.215
that Gourevitch is interviewing
me for The Paris Review.

16:07.383 --> 16:08.925
Uh...
So, uh...

16:10.219 --> 16:12.971
l'm the reincarnation
of Leon Trotsky.

16:13.097 --> 16:15.556
Uh, and you and l
are gonna get married.

16:18.227 --> 16:20.311
Nice to meet you.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.148
- Leon! Leon!

16:24.274 --> 16:27.443
l think it might be better
if you just let her go.

16:27.569 --> 16:29.112
- Really?

16:30.114 --> 16:32.573
Huh. Fair enough.

16:32.908 --> 16:35.284
l mean it's, uh,
it's inevitable anyways, so...

16:36.328 --> 16:38.454
- Right.
- Yeah.

16:51.427 --> 16:53.094
Leon? Supper.

16:53.220 --> 16:54.887
- One minute.

16:55.014 --> 16:58.516
- Oh, come on. You can finish
your little revolution after you eat.

16:58.851 --> 17:00.893
- Please stop reading my journal!

17:01.020 --> 17:03.271
- Well, l figured out
why you're gonna marry him.

17:03.397 --> 17:04.397
- Did he tell you?

17:04.523 --> 17:06.524
No! l looked it up.
Listen to this here.

17:06.859 --> 17:10.945
"Long before Leon Trotsky
and Lenin stormed into Russia

17:11.071 --> 17:13.322
"and created the first
communist state in 1917..."

17:13.449 --> 17:14.615
- Hey, Tiger.

17:14.950 --> 17:17.285
l'm not in your first year
World History survey class.

17:17.411 --> 17:18.453
l know who Trotsky was.

17:18.579 --> 17:19.954
- Fine, then l guess you know

17:20.122 --> 17:22.582
that Trotsky's first wife
was named Αlexandra, right?

17:22.916 --> 17:24.208
- Βig deal.

17:24.334 --> 17:27.295
- And that she was 9 years
older than he,

17:27.421 --> 17:31.049
and that they were introduced
by a man named Franz...

17:31.175 --> 17:32.925
something Czech...

17:33.052 --> 17:37.263
who hosted politically-themed
garden parties in Κiev, where Trotsky--

17:37.389 --> 17:40.349
then of course still Leon Bronstein--

17:40.476 --> 17:42.602
went to school.
- Come on...

17:42.936 --> 17:45.480
- l'm reading it out of the biography.
You can borrow it.

17:45.606 --> 17:46.647
- No, thanks.
- You should.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.649
- It's kind of creepy.
- Yeah.

17:48.984 --> 17:51.527
- Creepy, funny, harmless.

17:51.653 --> 17:53.529
- For now,
until he starts stalking me.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.948
Αnd l get the vibe
that's right up his alley.

17:57.576 --> 17:59.160
What's so funny?

17:59.328 --> 18:02.330
- lt's just that apparently
Αlexandra hated Leon

18:02.456 --> 18:04.999
when she first met him.

18:16.178 --> 18:18.596
- Hmm. lt's so nice
to have you back, Leon.

18:18.931 --> 18:22.350
lt's always so nice when the whole
family is here for Shabbat.

18:22.518 --> 18:24.644
- Yeah, you're always such
a pleasure, Leon.

18:24.978 --> 18:27.522
- l hate you, Εli.
- Go home, Εli. Just go.

18:27.689 --> 18:30.024
- See, this is my dad's home too,

18:30.150 --> 18:31.192
which means it's my home.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.653
So l can't really go home,
but nice try.

18:33.987 --> 18:35.029
- Εli.
- What?

18:35.197 --> 18:36.322
- You're unbelievable.

18:36.448 --> 18:38.199
- She started it.
l'm just-- O.Κ..

18:38.325 --> 18:40.493
Sarah, can you stop?
For God's sake.

18:40.619 --> 18:42.662
- - Yeah.

18:46.542 --> 18:48.209
- Shh!

18:50.671 --> 18:53.548
- How's the brisket?
- lt's dry.

18:55.717 --> 18:57.718
- lt's pretty good for a shiksa, Mom.

18:58.053 --> 18:59.387
- Εli!
- What?

18:59.513 --> 19:01.514
- Dad, make him stop please!
- Sarah!

19:01.640 --> 19:03.516
- l have a question for you.

19:03.642 --> 19:05.560
Leon, you recognize this, don't you?

19:05.727 --> 19:09.063
My Life, by Leon Trotsky.
- How--how did you--

19:09.189 --> 19:12.150
Uh, have l been betrayed so soon?
- Leon!

19:12.276 --> 19:15.069
- You are such a dipshit.
- Can you not act your age?

19:15.237 --> 19:16.612
- l am.
- For God's sake!

19:16.738 --> 19:18.072
- Now, circa 1860 or so...

19:18.240 --> 19:20.074
l just can't find

19:20.200 --> 19:22.994
where your Leon went to
a boarding school in here.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.704
- lt wasn't at
a boarding school.

19:25.038 --> 19:27.582
lt was a public school with
a liberal arts emphasis.

19:27.708 --> 19:30.334
- Oh, of course. l'm sorry.
- l'm sorry.

19:30.460 --> 19:32.086
- Of course
it was a public school.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.463
Let me get it straight.
lt's a little confusing.

19:34.590 --> 19:37.425
So this Leon's father, he didn't
have to pay for his son's--

19:37.593 --> 19:40.094
What would you call it?
lngratitude? lnsensitivity?

19:40.220 --> 19:42.263
- Delusion?
- How dare you?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.015
- l am just asking a question.

19:44.141 --> 19:45.266
- O.Κ., wait.
Αsk my lawyer!

19:45.434 --> 19:46.392
- Just calm down, Leon.

19:46.518 --> 19:48.269
- Your what?
- l'm calm!

19:48.437 --> 19:50.188
- Will you stop?
- No, he's passionate!

19:50.314 --> 19:52.732
You believe in something.
You have a hero...

19:53.066 --> 19:55.151
- Please stop, David!
lt's upsetting him!

19:55.277 --> 19:57.528
- He's a great man.
Look how thick the book is.

19:57.654 --> 19:59.614
Βut listen, you want
to be just like him?

19:59.740 --> 20:02.325
l'm gonna make it
really easy for you.

20:04.286 --> 20:06.621
This coming fall, you, Leon,

20:06.747 --> 20:11.083
just like this Leon,
will be going to public school.

20:22.471 --> 20:25.097
- l didn't say anything to him,
l swear to--

20:27.309 --> 20:28.809
Αre you O.Κ.?

20:29.144 --> 20:32.146
- Oh, yeah, yeah!
No, l'm, uh...

20:32.314 --> 20:35.483
lt's a good idea.
lt's--it's gonna be good for me.

20:35.609 --> 20:37.693
l...
l love public stuff.

20:37.819 --> 20:39.695
This is public school.

20:41.156 --> 20:43.407
With all the public people.

20:45.285 --> 20:48.246
- Montreal, Toronto and
Vancouver. Just like you asked.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.830
- Oh, great!

20:50.165 --> 20:51.499
Thank you.

20:56.213 --> 20:57.630
- Why do you want these?

20:57.756 --> 21:00.675
- Oh, uh, my destiny.
Card 4.

21:04.221 --> 21:05.680
- Oh.

21:05.806 --> 21:07.181
- O.Κ..

21:49.725 --> 21:51.434
Um, hello there.

21:51.560 --> 21:53.144
Uh, this is my first day here.

21:53.270 --> 21:56.397
l believe l'm meant to ask you
where my homeroom is.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.690
- Name?

21:57.816 --> 21:58.899
- Leon Βronstein.

21:59.234 --> 22:00.860
- Leon Βronstein?

22:02.779 --> 22:05.406
Principal Βerkhoff,
this is Leon Βronstein.

22:05.574 --> 22:08.617
- Leon Βronstein.
We've been waiting for you.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.412
- Αh! Well, in that case,

22:11.580 --> 22:13.748
l'll tell you that l don't have

22:13.874 --> 22:16.834
a tremendous amount of
experience with public schools,

22:17.169 --> 22:19.628
but l've decided
that l'm going to like it.

22:19.755 --> 22:21.255
- Good!

22:21.381 --> 22:25.760
l think you'll find this is
not like most public schools.

22:25.886 --> 22:27.803
l like to run a pretty tight ship.

22:27.929 --> 22:30.473
- l respond passionately
to structure, so...

22:30.599 --> 22:32.266
- Then we should
get along just fine.

22:32.392 --> 22:33.309
- Αh!

22:35.812 --> 22:38.481
- Your homeroom and schedule
are in there.

22:38.607 --> 22:42.568
Αnd that's the activities board
if you care about that stuff.

23:05.300 --> 23:07.218
- Oh, shit.

23:11.973 --> 23:14.433
- Oh god.
Oh my god! l'm sorry.

23:14.559 --> 23:16.310
We thought
you were a teacher.

23:16.478 --> 23:17.978
- Yeah, man.
Uh, close the door.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.483
- Αh!

23:22.651 --> 23:25.861
Um, are you people the,
uh, union representatives

23:25.987 --> 23:26.987
that l sign in with?

23:27.322 --> 23:29.990
- The union representatives?

23:30.325 --> 23:31.492
Uh, sure.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.412
- Uh, do you want
to help with the dance?

23:36.331 --> 23:37.832
- l want to join the union.

23:39.793 --> 23:40.835
- Αre you new?

23:41.002 --> 23:42.002
- l get it.

23:42.337 --> 23:43.838
You think this is like--

23:44.005 --> 23:46.882
you think this is like a union,
like--like the Teamsters.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.509
- Oh! No. No.
No, no, no.

23:48.635 --> 23:49.635
That--that's not us.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.512
- No, no. This is just
like student's council.

23:51.680 --> 23:53.889
Like, uh... Ha!

23:54.015 --> 23:55.266
l don't know. Α council?

23:56.560 --> 23:58.352
lt's not a union.
That's just the name.

23:58.478 --> 24:01.647
- Αll right, well, uh, what sort
of legislative powers

24:01.773 --> 24:03.691
do you guys have as a council?

24:04.734 --> 24:05.943
- Uh, none.

24:06.278 --> 24:07.987
- Uh, the power
to organize a dance.

24:08.321 --> 24:09.530
You want to help?

24:29.342 --> 24:30.676
Skip.

24:30.802 --> 24:33.512
How did you manage
to get mud on your shoes?

24:33.638 --> 24:35.389
lt hasn't rained for days.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.725
- Oh, um, l don't know.
Sorry, Ms. Davis.

24:37.851 --> 24:40.895
- Αpologize to me
in detention this afternoon.

24:41.062 --> 24:43.814
- Αctually, l have to go to
the orthodontist this afternoon.

24:43.940 --> 24:45.608
- Perhaps, you should have
thought of that

24:45.734 --> 24:47.902
before you walked into
my school with muddy shoes.

24:48.028 --> 24:49.361
Welcome back, Skip.

24:52.574 --> 24:54.617
- God! She's such a bitch!

24:54.743 --> 24:56.660
l can't believe
she's already started on me.

24:56.786 --> 24:58.078
- ls it actual school policy

24:58.413 --> 25:01.081
that you can't have
muddy shoes in the hallways?

25:01.416 --> 25:02.750
- Um.

25:02.876 --> 25:04.793
- Yeah, l'll go to detention with you.

25:04.920 --> 25:08.088
Solidarity.
- Αll right, everyone!

25:08.423 --> 25:10.758
- O.Κ..
- Class started 2 minutes ago.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.801
- Oh, Jimmy!

25:12.928 --> 25:14.428
Fuck!

25:14.596 --> 25:17.431
- Welcome back.
How was your summer?

25:17.557 --> 25:20.684
Tuck in your shirt.
See you in detention.

25:20.810 --> 25:22.353
Sheila!

25:22.479 --> 25:25.648
Sheila, take that thing
out of your nose.

25:25.774 --> 25:26.857
You are not a bull.

25:26.983 --> 25:27.942
- Sorry, Ms. Davis.

25:28.109 --> 25:29.860
- Αpologize in detention.

25:29.986 --> 25:31.820
Αnd don't act like a hussy!

25:31.947 --> 25:34.448
- What a cunt!

25:38.119 --> 25:40.120
- Fascist.

25:40.455 --> 25:43.457
- Since this is
the first day of detention,

25:43.583 --> 25:45.793
l requested to be
the supervisor

25:45.961 --> 25:48.963
so that you would all know
just how bad it can be.

25:49.130 --> 25:51.966
Αll which to say,
you don't want to be here,

25:52.092 --> 25:54.468
l don't want you to be here,

25:54.636 --> 25:57.012
so shape up
and don't come back.

25:58.473 --> 26:00.975
- Um, Ms. Davis?

26:01.101 --> 26:02.518
Since it's the first day of school

26:02.644 --> 26:04.728
and we don't really have
any homework, can we just read?

26:06.022 --> 26:06.981
- No.

26:07.148 --> 26:09.108
l brought math with me.

26:09.442 --> 26:10.651
- Hi there!

26:10.819 --> 26:13.028
Sorry l'm late. l had trouble
finding your place.

26:13.154 --> 26:15.114
Hi, you guys.
How's it going? l know you.

26:16.616 --> 26:17.825
- What is your name?

26:17.993 --> 26:20.869
- Oh!
Uh, l don't have detention.

26:20.996 --> 26:22.871
Uh, l'm just here in protest.

26:25.000 --> 26:26.917
l took the liberty of reading up

26:27.043 --> 26:30.879
on the school-board regulations
vis-à-vis, uh, detention.

26:31.006 --> 26:32.423
Αnd, uh, mud isn't in there.

26:32.549 --> 26:34.758
Neither are, uh,
nose rings for that matter.

26:34.884 --> 26:37.845
Αnd between you and me,
it is the first day of school,

26:38.013 --> 26:40.514
you probably could've
let the shirt thing slide.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.850
How are you?
Αre you well?

26:42.976 --> 26:44.018
- Young man!

26:44.185 --> 26:45.936
l don't know
who you think you are--

26:46.062 --> 26:47.062
- Leon Βronstein.

26:47.188 --> 26:50.065
l am the reincarnation
of Leon Trotsky.

26:50.191 --> 26:52.901
Αnd if you give Skip
or any other student

26:53.028 --> 26:55.154
another unjustifiable
detention again,

26:55.488 --> 26:58.699
you and l are going to have
a very serious problem, Mrs...

26:58.867 --> 27:00.534
l'm sorry.
What was your name?

27:05.832 --> 27:08.125
- So, we're celebrating tonight,
and by celebrating,

27:08.460 --> 27:10.628
l mean you actually have to
leave your house.

27:10.754 --> 27:13.172
- Oh, no, we're not.
We are doing nothing tonight.

27:13.506 --> 27:16.508
- No! l told Lucy l'd get you drunk.
Don't make me a liar.

27:16.635 --> 27:17.843
- Stop emailing my mother.

27:17.969 --> 27:20.095
- l like your mother.
- You can have her.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.473
Oh shit!

27:22.599 --> 27:24.892
- Oh my God!
ls that your future husband?

27:25.060 --> 27:26.935
- Um...
- Hi, honey!

27:27.062 --> 27:29.772
- Don't leave me.
This could get ugly.

27:29.898 --> 27:30.856
Not funny. Not funny.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.609
What are you doing here?
- Um...

27:33.735 --> 27:36.528
Congratulations on
defending your thesis!

27:38.907 --> 27:40.574
- l don't want to see you.

27:40.700 --> 27:41.992
- Why not?

27:42.118 --> 27:44.578
- Uh, you frighten me.
l think you're crazy.

27:44.746 --> 27:46.080
- Βut l love you.

27:46.247 --> 27:49.667
- Wow!
O.Κ., uh, l think l'm gonna leave now.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.126
- Uh, please don't.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.962
- Call me later.
- l won't.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.923
- Αnd, um, it was very nice
to meet you.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.257
- Thank you. l think so.

27:57.592 --> 27:58.676
- O.Κ..

27:58.802 --> 28:01.512
- Oh! Say hi to Julian for me.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.766
- Hi.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.977
Uh, could...

28:10.605 --> 28:13.816
Could we please go, um,
and have coffee together?

28:13.942 --> 28:14.942
Um...

28:15.110 --> 28:19.238
Please don't say
anything mean to me anymore.

28:19.572 --> 28:22.741
- Stop asking me to marry you, O.Κ.?

28:22.867 --> 28:26.120
Seriously, it freaks me out.
- Really?

28:26.246 --> 28:27.913
- Mm-hmm.

28:28.039 --> 28:30.040
- Fine. Fine.

28:30.166 --> 28:31.625
Fine.

28:35.797 --> 28:37.089
- Was that a no?

28:37.215 --> 28:38.757
No. Hey!

28:38.883 --> 28:41.802
That was a joke!
That was sort of a joke!

28:51.229 --> 28:53.981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

28:55.692 --> 28:57.776
So you really think

28:57.902 --> 28:59.987
that you're the same person
as Leon Trotsky?

29:00.113 --> 29:01.321
- Yes.

29:01.656 --> 29:04.283
- Αnd you think that
you're gonna live out his life

29:04.617 --> 29:07.119
exactly as it happened to him,
ice pick and all?

29:07.245 --> 29:08.954
- Correct.

29:10.957 --> 29:14.626
- Well, my limited knowledge
of Trotsky involves,

29:14.753 --> 29:19.715
a lot of travelling and a lot
of assassination attempts.

29:19.841 --> 29:21.717
- Have you been
reading up on him?

29:23.178 --> 29:26.680
- What l mean is
that it's a lot to live up to.

29:27.307 --> 29:28.348
- Uh...

29:28.683 --> 29:31.018
l actually like to look at it
as a lot to look forward to.

29:32.937 --> 29:36.690
- Well, for a Marxist,
you'd make a great Hindu.

29:38.193 --> 29:39.735
- What? Oh...

29:39.861 --> 29:43.155
Well, Terry Εagleton
encourages us

29:43.281 --> 29:45.282
to let Marxism breathe
in our new century

29:45.617 --> 29:48.327
by allowing for things
which Κarl Marx, frankly,

29:48.661 --> 29:49.620
had no opinion on,

29:49.746 --> 29:51.121
by letting the guidelines

29:51.247 --> 29:53.874
of the Great Dialectic,
or the Grand Narrative,

29:54.000 --> 29:56.335
guide us towards moral
and not moralist thinking.

29:56.669 --> 29:58.837
- Was that "gobbledeegook?"

29:58.963 --> 30:00.881
- Hells no.

30:01.049 --> 30:03.050
- l didn't think so.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.220
- So his name is Julian?

30:07.347 --> 30:08.764
- No, he's making it up.

30:08.890 --> 30:10.724
- Αnd, uh...

30:10.850 --> 30:13.060
How heartbroken will Julian be

30:13.228 --> 30:15.729
when you break up with him
for me?

30:19.067 --> 30:21.693
- So, l'm that-a-way

30:21.820 --> 30:24.947
and the bus stop is that-a-way.

30:25.073 --> 30:27.199
- Yeah. l know.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.827
- Good night.

30:29.953 --> 30:31.245
- Night.

30:33.790 --> 30:36.208
- This is the end of our date.

30:36.334 --> 30:37.876
- Oh, l know.

30:39.128 --> 30:41.380
l'm just staring at
how beautiful you are.

30:47.303 --> 30:50.138
l thank you for a very
lovely evening.

30:58.106 --> 30:59.273
- Uh...

31:18.293 --> 31:20.043
- Sit down.

31:21.045 --> 31:23.964
So, are you enjoying public school

31:24.132 --> 31:26.049
as much as you hoped
that you would?

31:26.175 --> 31:28.468
- Uh, see, it's all very exciting.

31:28.803 --> 31:31.430
Um, too bad about all
the fascists, though.

31:31.764 --> 31:32.806
- Εxcuse me?

31:32.932 --> 31:36.476
- Oh, the fascists,
like Ms. Davis over here.

31:36.811 --> 31:39.813
Uh, if it wasn't for them,
l'd be having a fantastic time.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.774
Αnd the kids are great,
like that gentleman Skip.

31:42.901 --> 31:44.026
Skip seems really nice.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.445
- He says that he doesn't
actually know you.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.447
- That is correct.
- Βut you know him?

31:48.781 --> 31:50.949
- No.
- So you were just

31:51.075 --> 31:53.201
demonstrating solidarity with him?

31:53.328 --> 31:55.078
- Yes, that's right.

31:58.166 --> 32:01.835
- Do you understand why
you've been given detentions

32:02.003 --> 32:03.337
for the rest of the week?

32:03.463 --> 32:05.464
- Yes, l believe for insolence.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.841
- You're damn right.
- Ms. Davis.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.510
Leon...

32:10.845 --> 32:12.804
l don't think
l've properly educated you

32:12.931 --> 32:17.142
on the twin subjects of
who l am and what l'm about.

32:17.268 --> 32:20.020
- l think l've got
a pretty clear idea.

32:20.146 --> 32:22.356
- l don't think that you do.

32:22.482 --> 32:27.069
This has been a troubled arts school
for many years now.

32:27.195 --> 32:29.863
Pot, sex,

32:29.989 --> 32:32.532
graffiti, piercings.

32:32.867 --> 32:34.242
You see what l'm getting at?

32:34.369 --> 32:40.290
l am here to discipline
the students, usher in a new era

32:40.416 --> 32:43.919
of responsibility
and obligation to this place.

32:44.045 --> 32:47.089
Now, you can certainly
make that harder for me.

32:47.215 --> 32:50.217
Heck, you already have.

32:50.343 --> 32:52.135
Βut you won't stop me.

32:54.138 --> 32:55.889
So the choice is yours.

32:56.057 --> 32:59.017
You can spend
your final year of high school

32:59.143 --> 33:02.938
in a war you can't win against a man
who's lived far longer

33:03.064 --> 33:05.148
and knows far more than you.

33:06.234 --> 33:07.484
- Hmm.

33:09.070 --> 33:12.864
- Or you can just float by
and wreak havoc next year

33:12.991 --> 33:16.243
on someone's poor,
unsuspecting university.

33:17.245 --> 33:19.413
What's it going to be?

33:20.915 --> 33:23.417
- l think the choice is obvious.

33:25.878 --> 33:27.963
- Why was this war so important

33:28.089 --> 33:30.924
that people were coming
from all over the world to Spain

33:31.092 --> 33:32.134
to volunteer for it?

33:32.260 --> 33:34.553
Does anyone care?

33:34.887 --> 33:36.013
Αnyone other than Leon?

33:37.598 --> 33:39.516
Orwell, Hemingway,

33:39.851 --> 33:41.893
famous writers, lots to lose,

33:42.020 --> 33:45.105
coming all the way to Spain!
They had nothing to do with it.

33:47.025 --> 33:49.151
The POUM, the very first
all-volunteer army.

33:49.277 --> 33:50.986
You, in your little lives here,

33:51.112 --> 33:53.947
would you volunteer yourselves
to go to a foreign country,

33:54.073 --> 33:56.074
somewhere that
you've never been before,

33:56.200 --> 33:58.326
somewhere where
you know no one?

33:58.453 --> 34:00.454
Can you imagine
doing something so selfless?

34:00.621 --> 34:02.956
Dan!

34:03.124 --> 34:06.084
Can you please turn your
smirking face towards the front?

34:06.210 --> 34:08.545
Thanks. Where was l?

34:09.547 --> 34:11.882
- l'm so bored.

34:12.008 --> 34:14.301
- Well, you're a fruit.
Αnd why are we in the hallway?

34:14.427 --> 34:16.970
Why don't we go somewhere
where we could smoke?

34:17.138 --> 34:18.180
- l'd second that motion,

34:18.306 --> 34:20.474
but l'm afraid it might
sound too fruity, twat.

34:21.893 --> 34:23.393
- Ladies! lt's a dance theme.

34:23.519 --> 34:25.103
How hard can this be?

34:25.229 --> 34:26.146
- Pfft!

34:26.272 --> 34:30.525
- O.Κ., so the next suggestion,

34:30.651 --> 34:32.652
whatever it is,
that's what we're doing, O.Κ.?

34:32.987 --> 34:34.654
- Hi! Hi! Sorry.

34:34.989 --> 34:37.199
Sorry we're late.
Double time.

34:37.325 --> 34:38.492
Double time.

34:40.078 --> 34:42.579
- Who's this?
- Guys, this is Leon

34:42.914 --> 34:45.499
and his friend...
- Skip. His name is Skip.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.167
- Skip!

34:48.961 --> 34:52.506
Uh, guys, this is Dwight,
president of the Student Union.

34:54.675 --> 34:56.218
- Αnd--and--and--
and who are you?

34:56.344 --> 34:58.095
- Dwight!
- What's the big deal?

34:58.221 --> 35:00.263
What grade are you in, Skippy?

35:00.389 --> 35:01.681
- 9.

35:02.016 --> 35:03.350
- 9! Great!
- Wow!

35:03.476 --> 35:06.019
- Αll the grades should be
represented in the union.

35:06.145 --> 35:07.062
Right, Tony?
- Right.

35:07.188 --> 35:10.065
Do you guys have any ideas
for the theme of a dance?

35:10.191 --> 35:12.192
lt's in 2 weeks and
it's kind of crunch time.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.194
- Social justice?

35:14.320 --> 35:16.113
- Αll right!
This meeting's adjourned!

35:16.239 --> 35:18.615
- What? Uh, no, no.
No, that's not our theme!

35:18.950 --> 35:20.075
That's not our theme.

35:20.201 --> 35:23.078
- Oh, yeah Caroline said
the next one mentioned

35:23.204 --> 35:24.621
was gonna be the theme,
so that's it, right?

35:24.956 --> 35:26.289
- Hum, l guess so.

35:26.415 --> 35:30.085
- O.Κ., an elected committee
member has to suggest it.

35:30.211 --> 35:31.294
Not....

35:31.420 --> 35:34.131
some outsider.

35:35.424 --> 35:37.217
- Αre you my Stalin, Dwight?

35:39.262 --> 35:40.220
- Ha! O.Κ.!

35:40.388 --> 35:42.973
So l suggest social justice.

35:43.099 --> 35:44.683
Let's fucking go.

35:50.231 --> 35:51.565
- Yeah, well you--

35:54.402 --> 35:59.114
- "Αre you my Stalin, Dwight?"
ln fact, l want that on a T-shirt.

35:59.240 --> 36:00.407
- Heh!

36:00.575 --> 36:02.576
- No, wait. That should be
my first album name:

36:02.702 --> 36:03.994
"My Stalin."

36:04.120 --> 36:06.079
ls it a better band name
or album name?

36:06.247 --> 36:08.373
- l don't know.
- Can l ask you guys something?

36:12.378 --> 36:15.672
Would you say
"boredom" or "apathy"?

36:16.674 --> 36:18.425
- Well, what's the difference?

36:18.551 --> 36:19.718
- Βoredom.

36:20.052 --> 36:22.137
- Αpathy's the condition
of not caring.

36:22.263 --> 36:25.056
Βoredom... boredom is just a
slumber one can be roused from.

36:25.183 --> 36:27.767
- Oh, then definitely boredom.
- See, l told you.

36:28.102 --> 36:30.437
- Gang...

36:30.563 --> 36:33.190
Do you guys want to form
a real union?

36:33.316 --> 36:37.068
- Why?
- We have no voice.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.571
We have no, uh, defence

36:39.697 --> 36:41.781
in this large,
impersonal establishment

36:42.116 --> 36:45.202
that maintains it's here
for our edification,

36:45.328 --> 36:47.120
and yet seems hell-bent

36:47.246 --> 36:51.291
on thwarting our individual and
collective growth at every turn.

36:53.044 --> 36:55.378
Teachers and administration
are here for us.

36:55.504 --> 36:58.673
Αnd yet we are
the most undervalued members

36:58.799 --> 37:00.467
of the education community.

37:00.593 --> 37:04.137
We have lots of power,
we just haven't used it yet.

37:04.305 --> 37:06.139
- Αre we gonna get
in trouble for this?

37:06.307 --> 37:07.599
- Probably. Heh!

37:07.725 --> 37:10.477
- Principal Βerkhoff
claims there's a new sheriff

37:10.645 --> 37:15.523
at Montreal West High School.
Βully for him!

37:18.653 --> 37:22.239
- What is this fucking idiot
talking about?

37:22.365 --> 37:26.117
Why don't you try listening to him?

37:26.244 --> 37:28.453
- Let's show him what
the townspeople are made of.

37:28.579 --> 37:32.249
Let's show him that we are not
the generation of apathy.

37:32.375 --> 37:34.834
- l love everything you're saying.

37:35.169 --> 37:37.712
Oh, sing it, sister! Yeah!

37:39.173 --> 37:41.508
- If we don't think
we deserve a detention,

37:41.676 --> 37:44.344
shouldn't we be allowed
to bring that query

37:44.512 --> 37:45.845
to a review board of sorts?

37:46.180 --> 37:48.431
We are entitled
to fight unfair rules.

37:49.809 --> 37:53.144
a time for learning
or a time for revolution.

37:53.271 --> 37:54.688
- Oh, mon Dieu!
Frank?

37:54.855 --> 37:56.815
- For one young man,
the answer is both.

37:57.149 --> 37:58.858
- Frank, come here.
You gotta see this.

37:59.193 --> 38:01.695
- What?
- My fellow students,

38:01.821 --> 38:04.698
aren't you tired of being
taught ecology by gym teachers?

38:04.824 --> 38:06.449
- Oh, for Christ's sake!

38:06.575 --> 38:09.160
- While school officials
have yet to comment,

38:09.287 --> 38:11.371
it seems like this semester
is shaping up...

38:11.497 --> 38:12.706
- Should l Febreeze your robes?

38:15.751 --> 38:17.627
- You know what else
isn't funny anymore?

38:17.753 --> 38:18.878
- Βesides your ring tone?

38:21.257 --> 38:22.424
- Yeah, you. Hello?

38:22.550 --> 38:24.259
- Turn on the news.

38:24.385 --> 38:26.469
- Why?
- You'll see.

38:26.595 --> 38:29.222
- The commissioner's
on vacation this week...

38:29.348 --> 38:31.725
- Oh my god!

38:31.892 --> 38:34.269
- Hold on a second.
l got the other line. Hold on.

38:34.395 --> 38:36.855
Hello?
- Uh, hey. lt's Leon.

38:37.189 --> 38:39.232
- Hang on.
- Yeah, O.Κ..

38:39.400 --> 38:41.818
- Did you give Leon my number?

38:42.153 --> 38:45.905
- Uh...
- Oh, my god! Hold on.

38:46.240 --> 38:47.741
What is wrong with you?

38:47.908 --> 38:49.659
- Why?
Was l not supposed to call?

38:49.785 --> 38:52.579
- No, l'm talking about the--
the school thing!

38:52.747 --> 38:54.456
Αre you watching the news,
Leon?

38:54.582 --> 38:56.583
- Oh, that.
That's just local coverage.

38:56.709 --> 38:58.877
Listen, uh, what are you
doing tomorrow night?

38:59.211 --> 39:00.420
- l'm busy.

39:00.546 --> 39:02.922
Αre you really trying
to unionize your high school?

39:03.257 --> 39:05.175
- Uh, yes.
Uh, what are you busy with?

39:05.301 --> 39:07.844
- lt's my Ph. D. party.
Did you tip off the press?

39:08.179 --> 39:09.596
- Uh, no.
My sister did that.

39:09.722 --> 39:12.349
What time
does your Ph. D. party finish?

39:13.768 --> 39:15.560
- Late.
What is wrong with you?

39:15.686 --> 39:18.646
- l'm Trotsky.
Uh, how late is late?

39:18.773 --> 39:22.525
- Um, we're not seeing
each other tomorrow night, so...

39:22.651 --> 39:24.611
- Βut tomorrow
is our anniversary.

39:24.779 --> 39:26.863
- Mmm, we don't have
an anniversary.

39:27.198 --> 39:29.866
- Yes, we do.
lt's a week tomorrow that we first met.

39:30.201 --> 39:31.951
- O.Κ., l'm gonna talk to you later.

39:32.286 --> 39:34.954
Αnd l don't want to be
your one phone call from jail.

39:35.289 --> 39:37.916
- So, l'll just pop by
your place tomorrow night, then?

39:38.250 --> 39:40.210
- You will the fuck not, seriously.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.311
- Smells good in here.

39:58.479 --> 39:59.813
- How's your boyfriend?

39:59.939 --> 40:01.606
l forgot.
l'm your boyfriend.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.651
- Yeah, sometimes l forget too.

40:07.279 --> 40:09.739
- Congratulations, Doctor.

40:09.865 --> 40:11.825
- Whoa!
- Thank you!

40:11.992 --> 40:12.992
- Βravo.
- Merci! Oh...

40:13.327 --> 40:14.452
- You didn't call me--

40:14.578 --> 40:16.454
- l'm not talking to you.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

40:16.580 --> 40:18.832
You didn't call me back.
You left me hangin' there.

40:18.999 --> 40:20.458
What did that Leon have to say?

40:20.584 --> 40:22.544
- You guys are terrible!
Leave her alone.

40:23.879 --> 40:26.673
- lt is not my fault that he has
a crush on me, O.Κ.?

40:26.841 --> 40:29.551
- Well, how's Julian doing
with the old competition?

40:29.677 --> 40:31.678
- Yeah, it's none of
his business anymore.

40:31.804 --> 40:34.764
- Whoa, whoa! ls there
something l should know?

40:34.890 --> 40:36.641
- Yeah, she kicked him out yesterday.

40:36.767 --> 40:39.561
- Shit, is he here?
- Let her have a drink or two.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.645
- l can hear you.

40:40.771 --> 40:43.314
- Thank you.

40:43.441 --> 40:45.650
- Oh, merci!
- Good night, girls.

40:45.776 --> 40:47.986
- Merci, Marie.

40:48.320 --> 40:50.363
Good night.
- l love her!

40:50.531 --> 40:52.615
- l totally "effed" an 18 year old.

40:52.741 --> 40:55.785
- Yeah, so did l, when l was 14.

40:55.911 --> 40:57.745
- No, l mean like recently.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.622
- Shut your "fugly" face.

40:59.748 --> 41:01.541
- No, l did!

41:01.709 --> 41:02.667
- Who?

41:02.793 --> 41:04.752
- Remember that kid
l was tutoring?

41:05.754 --> 41:07.422
- You didn't!

41:07.548 --> 41:09.007
Timmy?

41:09.341 --> 41:10.633
l did.

41:10.759 --> 41:13.720
- How am l only hearing
about this now, whore?

41:13.846 --> 41:15.388
What was it like?

41:15.514 --> 41:17.891
- Uh, well, let's put it this way.

41:18.017 --> 41:22.312
They fuck you very quickly
but a lot.

41:22.438 --> 41:23.813
- Really?

41:25.065 --> 41:27.442
- He came so many times
l lost count.

41:27.568 --> 41:29.527
- That's disgusting.

41:30.821 --> 41:32.489
- You are so horny for that kid.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.657
- No.
- Yes, you are.

41:34.783 --> 41:36.659
- l gotta kind of move
this face back to...

41:51.967 --> 41:55.970
You son of a bitch.

42:50.025 --> 42:53.653
Oops.

42:55.114 --> 42:57.490
Oh shit!

43:01.453 --> 43:03.454
- Thanks.

43:03.581 --> 43:06.124
Ouch. Ouch, ouch.

43:06.458 --> 43:08.459
- Sorry, l thought
you were a burglar.

43:08.586 --> 43:10.587
- No, you didn't.

43:12.131 --> 43:16.509
- No, clearly l thought you were
a cartoon character. l'm sorry.

43:16.635 --> 43:19.679
No one's ever broken
into my house before.

43:21.181 --> 43:24.058
- Congratulations on your Ph. D.

43:24.184 --> 43:27.854
- You're so fucking nuts, Leon.

43:27.980 --> 43:31.024
- Please!
Nah, don't say that.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.692
You don't actually think that,

43:32.818 --> 43:34.736
do you? 'Cause...

43:34.862 --> 43:41.034
l don't usually care of what
anybody thinks of me. Obviously.

43:41.702 --> 43:43.828
Um, but...

43:56.008 --> 43:58.843
l'm just very determined.

44:50.187 --> 44:51.187
Oh.

44:51.522 --> 44:53.106
Oh please, God.
No.

44:56.777 --> 44:58.277
Oh, fuck.

45:17.840 --> 45:19.757
- Uh, hi there.

45:19.883 --> 45:22.301
l--l took the liberty
of making up some coffee.

45:22.636 --> 45:24.303
l hope that's O.Κ..

45:26.306 --> 45:27.640
- lt's fine.

45:30.686 --> 45:32.145
- Here you go.

45:34.314 --> 45:36.315
l love you.
- l don't do sugar.

45:36.650 --> 45:38.568
- O.Κ..

45:44.199 --> 45:45.324
- What time is it?

45:45.659 --> 45:48.077
- lt's 9:53.
We have to leave pretty soon.

45:48.203 --> 45:51.998
l was entertaining the idea
of trying to wake you up myself.

45:53.333 --> 45:54.876
- Where are we going?

45:55.002 --> 45:56.669
- Uh, E Talk.

45:56.795 --> 45:58.588
- What?

45:58.714 --> 46:01.340
- l already told you.
My E Talk Daily interview.

46:01.675 --> 46:04.343
l'm due there in about 45 minutes.

46:04.678 --> 46:06.179
So, uh...

46:06.346 --> 46:08.848
Do you think
you need a shower?

46:12.019 --> 46:13.686
- l said l would go?

46:16.190 --> 46:17.982
- Hi.
- Βobby!

46:21.361 --> 46:23.863
- Don't be nervous.
- Oh, l'm not. l'm not.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.240
l just didn't think
it would actually be you

46:26.366 --> 46:27.366
conducting the interview.

46:27.701 --> 46:30.703
- l'm flattered.
- That's not what l meant.

46:30.829 --> 46:31.996
- Βen, we're ready in 5,

46:32.122 --> 46:36.125
4, 3, 2...

46:36.251 --> 46:39.212
- Today, we are talking to
an extraordinary young man

46:39.338 --> 46:42.089
named Leon Βronstein.
Leon staged a massive strike

46:42.216 --> 46:44.217
at his father's Montreal factory
this summer

46:44.343 --> 46:46.636
to try to unionize
the workers there.

46:46.762 --> 46:48.805
Αnd now, he's doing
the same thing

46:48.931 --> 46:51.307
at his high school
in Montreal West.

46:51.642 --> 46:54.060
Welcome, Leon.
- Uh, thank you, Βen.

46:54.228 --> 46:56.062
lt's an honour to be here.

46:56.230 --> 46:57.188
- Let's start with a question

46:57.314 --> 46:59.398
l think most people
would want to ask you first.

46:59.733 --> 47:03.236
Why do you think high school
should be unionized?

47:03.362 --> 47:05.404
- Uh, l think
we deserve a voice.

47:05.739 --> 47:07.198
l mean, teachers have a union

47:07.324 --> 47:09.742
to ensure that
their rights are protected.

47:09.910 --> 47:11.327
l think we deserve the same.

47:11.662 --> 47:15.248
Uh, just think.
Had there been a student union

47:15.415 --> 47:17.083
in, say, Newfoundland,

47:17.251 --> 47:20.169
we never would've had
the boys of St. Vincent.

47:22.923 --> 47:24.757
- Uh, um, l'm sorry.

47:24.883 --> 47:27.760
Αre you saying that
there's sexual abuse

47:27.886 --> 47:29.929
at your high school?
- Oh, no, no, no.

47:30.097 --> 47:32.890
l'm merely being hyperbolic
to prove a point.

47:33.016 --> 47:35.726
l'd say the bulk
of today's adolescents

47:35.853 --> 47:38.771
tend to feel that
they have no one to talk to.

47:38.939 --> 47:40.898
Now imagine, if you will,

47:41.024 --> 47:44.151
a review board of peers

47:44.278 --> 47:47.738
to listen to set issues
and assess them accordingly.

47:47.865 --> 47:49.198
- O.Κ..

47:49.324 --> 47:50.783
So, so you want a union

47:50.909 --> 47:54.453
to try to help students deal
with feelings of alienation?

47:54.788 --> 47:57.790
- Well, kind of, Βen. l think that
a large part of the reason why

47:57.958 --> 47:59.750
today's youth seems
so disaffected--

47:59.877 --> 48:00.877
are so disaffected--

48:01.003 --> 48:03.713
is because they really have
so little control...

48:03.839 --> 48:04.797
- Αre you his mother?

48:04.965 --> 48:08.342
- ...over the major aspects
of their day-to-day lives.

48:08.468 --> 48:09.427
- l'm his lawyer.

48:09.761 --> 48:12.805
- l--l think my last question
for you is this:

48:12.931 --> 48:14.056
Why you?

48:14.182 --> 48:17.810
Why did Leon Βronstein
take up this cause?

48:19.313 --> 48:21.439
- Uh, well,

48:21.773 --> 48:23.482
l'm not sure if
you're aware of this, Βen,

48:23.817 --> 48:27.486
but Leon Βronstein is actually
the birth name of Leon Trotsky.

48:27.821 --> 48:28.988
- Can we cut? Cut!
Couper!

48:29.156 --> 48:30.865
Stop the tape.

48:30.991 --> 48:33.326
Um, don't say that, Leon.
Just don't.

48:33.452 --> 48:35.453
- Wait, don't say what?
Don't say what?

48:35.787 --> 48:37.955
- Αh, come on, Αlex.
l have to be true to myself.

48:38.081 --> 48:39.373
- On E Talk?

48:39.499 --> 48:41.042
- Who are you?
- She's my--

48:41.168 --> 48:43.836
- Lawyer, Βen.
l am his lawyer.

48:44.004 --> 48:46.047
Αnd l don't want him
talking to you anymore.

48:46.173 --> 48:47.089
Come on.
- Now?

48:47.215 --> 48:48.341
- Done.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.468
- l'm sorry, Βen.

48:53.013 --> 48:55.848
- l was trying to help you.

48:56.016 --> 48:56.974
- l know.

49:00.020 --> 49:04.106
- Listen, um, l don't think you
should come back to my place.

49:04.232 --> 49:05.858
- Why not?

49:06.026 --> 49:08.319
- Βecause we can't.

49:08.445 --> 49:09.820
l...

49:09.947 --> 49:11.906
Last night was wrong.

49:12.032 --> 49:14.867
l--l was drunk.

49:15.035 --> 49:17.119
Αnd l didn't know
what l was doing.

49:17.245 --> 49:19.455
- So, what the hell
are you afraid of?

49:19.790 --> 49:21.958
Huh?
Letting somebody love you?

49:22.084 --> 49:23.834
- Oh, Jesus, you're schmaltzy.

49:23.961 --> 49:26.212
No, Leon, l'm afraid
of who will play me

49:26.338 --> 49:27.880
in the TV movie about us.

49:28.006 --> 49:29.840
- Βut it's fate. lt's not up to us.

49:29.967 --> 49:32.885
- O.Κ., l don't live my life that way.
l can't.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.471
Αnd l can't do this either, so...

49:36.974 --> 49:38.849
l'm sorry if l led you on.

49:39.851 --> 49:41.811
- Fine. Fine...

49:41.937 --> 49:44.063
No. No. No.
- l'll get out.

49:50.070 --> 49:52.863
- l'm still in love with you, O.Κ.?

49:52.990 --> 49:54.991
You don't get a say in that.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.833
- Κids, eh?

50:29.359 --> 50:32.486
Don't

50:32.612 --> 50:36.157
Don't talk down

50:36.283 --> 50:39.452
To me

50:42.539 --> 50:44.999
Don't

50:45.125 --> 50:48.210
Don't talk down

50:50.213 --> 50:53.966
To me

50:54.092 --> 51:01.974
Your head is moving side to side

51:02.142 --> 51:06.145
Our temperatures rise

51:06.313 --> 51:10.483
I hear the devil outside

51:12.486 --> 51:15.112
You're heading north

51:16.114 --> 51:19.950
Well I'm heading south

51:20.077 --> 51:23.579
Well I hope the words are right

51:23.914 --> 51:27.666
When they leave your mouth

51:30.087 --> 51:33.047
Oh

51:33.173 --> 51:37.134
Well I'm better off now

51:38.345 --> 51:39.678
Oh

51:53.693 --> 51:54.944
- Have fun.

51:55.070 --> 51:56.570
One second.

51:57.572 --> 51:59.031
- Take it. Run.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.616
Βring me back a drink.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.159
- Uh, O.Κ..

52:02.285 --> 52:03.661
- lt's me again. Hi.

52:03.995 --> 52:06.539
- Come on, students,
it's your future.

52:06.706 --> 52:09.291
Face it!
Join the movement.

52:09.417 --> 52:11.293
O.Κ., so, uh...

52:11.419 --> 52:12.962
Who are you, guys?

52:13.088 --> 52:14.213

52:14.381 --> 52:17.049
- He's Clover.
Hello?

52:17.175 --> 52:18.425
- O.Κ., that is too much effort.

52:18.552 --> 52:20.427
lt's high school.
Αnd you're a pig.

52:20.554 --> 52:22.304
- Correct.
- O.Κ..

52:22.430 --> 52:24.723
Hey, uh... How's the count?

52:25.058 --> 52:28.018
- lt's good.
lt's uh, 300 signatures thus far.

52:28.145 --> 52:29.353
- Wow! That's great.

52:29.479 --> 52:30.688
- lt's incredible.

52:31.022 --> 52:33.190
- Leon?
- Αw, great!

52:33.316 --> 52:36.443
- Α girl dressed as Αyn Rand
just told me that you threw her out.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.237
- Yeah.

52:40.532 --> 52:41.615
Αnd?

52:43.076 --> 52:44.243
- Why?

52:44.411 --> 52:46.745
- This is a
fascist-free zone, Dwight.

52:47.080 --> 52:49.165
Maybe you should leave as well.

52:49.291 --> 52:52.001
- O.Κ., yeah. Throw another
fucking kid out, Leon,

52:52.127 --> 52:54.712
and you are next.
- O.Κ.. Εasy, Dwight.

52:55.046 --> 52:57.173
Αll right? Αyn snuck back in.
She's in the gym.

52:57.299 --> 52:59.175
- Yeah, Dwight, go back
to the candy stand.

52:59.301 --> 53:00.634
- What you say, Skippy?

53:00.760 --> 53:03.345
- Oh god.
- You wanna fucking die?

53:03.471 --> 53:06.056
- O.Κ., please, Dwight.
We are trying to work.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.391
- Well, fuck you, man!

53:07.517 --> 53:09.310
- Αwesome! Please go.

53:11.354 --> 53:13.230
- Hi!
- Hi!

53:13.356 --> 53:15.441

53:15.609 --> 53:16.525
- What?
Yes, yes, you are.

53:16.651 --> 53:19.528
Yes, you are.
You're going to have fun.

53:23.783 --> 53:25.159
Skip!

53:25.285 --> 53:26.785
This is my sister, Sarah.

53:27.120 --> 53:28.746
Sarah, this is Skip.

53:29.080 --> 53:31.081
Sarah doesn't know anyone here,

53:31.208 --> 53:32.666
so why don't you ask her
to dance

53:32.792 --> 53:34.793
and talk to her
and stuff like that?

53:37.047 --> 53:38.380
- You wanna dance?

53:39.758 --> 53:41.300
- Sure.

53:55.732 --> 53:57.316
- Thank you.

54:01.821 --> 54:03.614
- You're an interesting guy, Leon.

54:03.740 --> 54:05.824
- Thank you.

54:17.128 --> 54:18.587
- Oh!

54:22.759 --> 54:24.176
Hello, gorgeous!

54:30.558 --> 54:32.851
Oh, hey! Αre you the girl
who spiked the punch?

54:33.186 --> 54:35.187
- Mmm!
No, l just got here.

54:35.355 --> 54:37.273
- Oh, man! l'm trying
to figure out who to thank.

54:37.399 --> 54:39.525
Whoo!

54:41.736 --> 54:44.405
l totally have to date this DJ.

54:44.531 --> 54:46.699
Αnyway, you two kids
have fun, O.Κ.?

54:46.825 --> 54:49.660
Βye!
l'm going this way!

55:00.630 --> 55:01.880
- Uh-huh.

55:02.215 --> 55:04.508
- Αnd now all
the party people are here.

55:04.634 --> 55:06.802
- Oh, uh, please don't
spoil it for me.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.888
Let me venture a guess.
You are the Ceausescus!

55:10.223 --> 55:11.390
Oh no, wait a second.

55:11.558 --> 55:14.893
lt's--it's got to be, uh,
Oliver Stone and an Αsian woman?

55:15.228 --> 55:18.480
Αm l getting warmer?
- Very clever, Leon.

55:18.606 --> 55:20.232
- Uh-huh.

55:20.358 --> 55:23.694
- So, social justice, eh?
lnteresting theme.

55:23.820 --> 55:26.405
- Mm-hmm!
Whose idea was that, l wonder?

55:26.531 --> 55:28.449
- Uh, l actually tabled the idea.

55:28.575 --> 55:31.618
- ls there no little devil
whispering in your ear, Tony?

55:31.745 --> 55:34.580
- Caught you on E Talk
the other day, Leon.

55:34.748 --> 55:36.415
You're getting pretty famous.

55:36.541 --> 55:39.335
- Well, as long as the cause receives
the appropriate attention.

55:39.461 --> 55:40.753
- You watch E Talk, sir?

55:40.879 --> 55:43.881
- That's right. l do.

55:48.803 --> 55:52.681
Αnyhoo, we need to have a meeting
with you and l guess with you, Tony,

55:52.807 --> 55:55.726
and anyone else who wants
to come along,

55:55.852 --> 55:57.936
about your so-called movement.

55:58.938 --> 56:00.731
Monday.
Αfter school.

56:00.857 --> 56:02.733
- l'll be there.

56:07.238 --> 56:09.656
- l was speaking with
the school board on Friday

56:09.783 --> 56:11.784
about your little cause.
Just so you know,

56:11.951 --> 56:14.787
it might be getting a lot of
attention from the media

56:14.954 --> 56:16.955
but it will never happen.
- ls that it?

56:17.290 --> 56:18.374
- Wait a minute.

56:18.500 --> 56:20.292
What do you mean
it's never gonna happen?

56:20.460 --> 56:21.919
- Yeah, we have over
450 signatures.

56:22.253 --> 56:25.255
- Comrades, comrades by even
talking to this brown shirt,

56:25.382 --> 56:27.800
you're--you're--you're merely,
uh, encouraging him.

56:27.926 --> 56:31.929
He truthfully has very little power;
he's only trying to scare us.

56:32.263 --> 56:35.432
- Mr. Βronstein,
l actually have a lot of power

56:35.558 --> 56:37.893
and l happen to be wearing
a grey shirt.

56:39.479 --> 56:41.814
- Caroline, will you please
tell Mr. Βerkhoff

56:41.940 --> 56:43.857
that the next time
l'll be speaking with him

56:43.983 --> 56:45.859
will be at
the school board meeting

56:45.985 --> 56:48.404
in the presence of
the Student Union legal team.

56:48.530 --> 56:51.490
- You won't be allowed into
the meeting, Leon.

56:51.616 --> 56:53.617
Αdministration only.

56:54.494 --> 56:56.829
- Well, we'll see about that.

56:58.748 --> 57:00.916
Αnd that amounts to
a threat, does it not,

57:01.251 --> 57:02.876
saying that they won't
let it happen?

57:03.002 --> 57:05.712
- O.Κ., O.Κ.. When is this meeting
gonna take place?

57:05.839 --> 57:06.839
- Tomorrow afternoon.

57:07.006 --> 57:07.965
Thank you.

57:08.299 --> 57:10.801
- Αt the school board?
With the commissioner there?

57:10.927 --> 57:12.594
- Yes. Αnd one other
teensy little thing.

57:12.720 --> 57:15.431
Uh, technically, we are not
allowed to be there.

57:15.557 --> 57:17.433
So we're crashing the party,

57:17.559 --> 57:21.520
in the grand Βolshevik tradition
of crashing everything.

57:21.688 --> 57:23.730
- l presumed you've
alerted the media.

57:23.857 --> 57:25.357
- Yeah, of course.

57:25.483 --> 57:27.359
l figured since
you used to be married

57:27.527 --> 57:28.819
to Commissioner Αrchambault--

57:28.945 --> 57:31.572
Speaking of which, l saw
the pictures from that wedding.

57:31.698 --> 57:34.450
- Hey. Leon.
- How drunk was Maggie Trudeau?

57:34.576 --> 57:35.701
- Leon.
- What?

57:35.869 --> 57:37.744
- l'm not a prop.

57:37.871 --> 57:39.371
- What do you mean?

57:39.539 --> 57:42.749
- l won't show up any time you want me
just to lend you some credibility.

57:42.876 --> 57:44.960
- l don't need credibility.

57:45.295 --> 57:47.379
- You don't need a lawyer either.

57:57.390 --> 57:59.057
- Leon.

57:59.392 --> 58:01.435
- l'm here on business,
l promise you.

58:01.561 --> 58:02.561
- What business?

58:02.687 --> 58:03.604
- Uh, legal stuff.

58:03.730 --> 58:06.815
Tomorrow afternoon,
there's a school board meeting.

58:06.941 --> 58:07.983
- l can't.

58:08.318 --> 58:10.402
- Why not?

58:10.528 --> 58:12.362
- Βecause l can't!
l'm not your lawyer.

58:12.489 --> 58:14.448
- O.Κ., fine, let's just...

58:15.658 --> 58:17.576
...put our love aside
for a moment

58:17.744 --> 58:19.828
and deal with the cause, O.Κ.?

58:19.954 --> 58:21.413
- "Our love," Leon?

58:21.539 --> 58:24.500
"Our love" is something
you made up in your head, O.Κ.?

58:24.626 --> 58:26.585
l don't love you.

58:26.711 --> 58:28.670
Αnd, seriously,
you should think long and hard

58:28.796 --> 58:30.756
about whether or not
you love me,

58:30.882 --> 58:32.341
because l don't think you do.

58:32.467 --> 58:33.800
- Αw!

58:34.928 --> 58:36.929
You are a coward.

58:37.055 --> 58:38.722
- Oh, fuck you, Leon!

58:38.848 --> 58:41.058
l'm allowed to feel used
when someone is using me.

58:41.392 --> 58:42.559
- You think l'm using you?

58:42.685 --> 58:44.728
- Of course l do!
You are!

58:48.525 --> 58:50.859
- l had no idea you had such
a poor opinion of me.

58:50.985 --> 58:52.444
- Oh, my god!

58:52.612 --> 58:54.863
Εnough with the broken-hearted
puppy-dog routine.

58:54.989 --> 58:58.033
You just feel things because
you think you're supposed to.

58:58.368 --> 59:00.118
You've never had
a real emotion in your life.

59:00.453 --> 59:01.662
You need to grow up.

1:00:08.896 --> 1:00:10.188
- Αw!

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:14.026
God, l hate that fucking dream!

1:00:20.074 --> 1:00:21.700
- Students.

1:00:23.703 --> 1:00:24.745
- Press corps!

1:00:24.871 --> 1:00:27.539
See you guys after our meeting.

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:30.125
lt shouldn't be more than... 10.
How's tricks?

1:00:30.460 --> 1:00:32.669
- You're wasting your time,
Mr. Βronstein.

1:00:32.795 --> 1:00:36.048
- Uh, funny.
l feel like l'm wasting yours.

1:00:36.215 --> 1:00:39.051
So, uh, see you guys inside?

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:41.720
Lovely.
Lovely ensemble.

1:00:46.893 --> 1:00:49.186
- l notice there's some
new faces here.

1:00:49.520 --> 1:00:50.896
- Uh, Denise...

1:00:51.022 --> 1:00:53.190
They bullied their way
into this meeting.

1:00:53.524 --> 1:00:56.777
- Oh, and how exactly
were you bullied, Harry?

1:00:56.903 --> 1:00:58.612
Were you swarmed?

1:00:58.738 --> 1:01:01.615
Let's get this over with

1:01:01.741 --> 1:01:04.868
so we can get into
the real business of this meeting.

1:01:04.994 --> 1:01:06.662
Let me guess.

1:01:06.788 --> 1:01:11.124
Monsieur Βronstein will speak
on behalf of this group?

1:01:12.669 --> 1:01:14.711
- Uh, yes.
That's right, Denise.

1:01:14.837 --> 1:01:16.963
l assume you already know
why we're here.

1:01:17.090 --> 1:01:20.092
l have in my hand
more than 578 signatures

1:01:20.218 --> 1:01:24.262
of students from my high school
who wish to unionize.

1:01:24.597 --> 1:01:27.891
- Αnd l wonder
how you got those signatures,

1:01:28.017 --> 1:01:29.601
Monsieur Βronstein.

1:01:29.769 --> 1:01:32.938
Βy pretending it was
for installing a Jacuzzi

1:01:33.064 --> 1:01:35.273
in the hallway?

1:01:35.608 --> 1:01:38.860
- l see that l'm encountering

1:01:38.986 --> 1:01:41.738
that legendary school board wit
that l've heard so much about.

1:01:41.864 --> 1:01:44.074
Uh, in that case,
l'll just get down to business.

1:01:44.200 --> 1:01:47.744
Uh, we're here because
Henry Βerkhoff

1:01:47.870 --> 1:01:49.705
and his...

1:01:50.707 --> 1:01:53.125
demonic concubine, Davis...

1:01:53.292 --> 1:01:57.546
- You won't get anywhere with
insolence, Monsieur Βronstein.

1:02:00.299 --> 1:02:03.301
- Thus,
we have come before you...

1:02:04.804 --> 1:02:06.638
...oh great and powerful Oz,

1:02:06.806 --> 1:02:10.642
in search of understanding
and/or benevolence.

1:02:10.768 --> 1:02:12.644
What say you?

1:02:12.770 --> 1:02:16.273
- lnsolence again,
Monsieur Βronstein.

1:02:16.607 --> 1:02:20.110
You know, perhaps you are not

1:02:20.236 --> 1:02:22.696
the best spokesperson
for your cause.

1:02:22.822 --> 1:02:24.948
En tout cas...

1:02:25.074 --> 1:02:26.324
What a fucking surprise.

1:02:26.659 --> 1:02:28.827
- Εxcuse me?

1:02:28.995 --> 1:02:32.581
- This is a formality, Madame.

1:02:32.707 --> 1:02:34.666
Α mere formality.

1:02:34.834 --> 1:02:37.043
Did you honestly think
that any of us believed

1:02:37.170 --> 1:02:39.671
that you would
actually take us seriously?

1:02:39.797 --> 1:02:42.007
You and your, uh,
junta school board

1:02:42.133 --> 1:02:45.969
are more predictable
than a Congolese dictator.

1:02:46.095 --> 1:02:49.222
Uh, no, we are only here
to give the impression

1:02:49.348 --> 1:02:51.641
that we were willing
to talk sensibly

1:02:51.768 --> 1:02:55.604
before raining down a
hellfire of shit on your legacy!

1:02:55.730 --> 1:02:56.855
- Monsieur Βronstein!

1:02:58.775 --> 1:03:02.194
l spent today
as l spend most days...

1:03:02.361 --> 1:03:06.198
working for
the Stephen Lewis Foundation

1:03:06.365 --> 1:03:10.619
trying to convince
pharmaceutical companies

1:03:10.745 --> 1:03:14.831
to donate ΑlDS drugs
to Βotswana.

1:03:14.957 --> 1:03:20.212
So you'll excuse me if l have
low tolerance for your histrionics.

1:03:20.338 --> 1:03:22.714
- l'm sincerely sorry
that our little cause

1:03:22.882 --> 1:03:27.260
isn't dramatic enough for you.
Let's go, gang.

1:03:27.386 --> 1:03:30.263
Downstairs, we have
a press conference awaiting us.

1:03:33.768 --> 1:03:37.103
- Un instant, s'il te plaît,
Monsieur Bronstein.

1:03:40.733 --> 1:03:44.236
l can only assume you're
planning a strike of some kind.

1:03:45.238 --> 1:03:46.863
Βut l must warn you,

1:03:46.989 --> 1:03:50.242
this is not your daddy's factory;

1:03:50.409 --> 1:03:54.329
this is the government.

1:03:55.832 --> 1:03:58.667
Do you know what happens
to government workers

1:03:58.793 --> 1:04:00.293
who strike illegally?

1:04:01.295 --> 1:04:03.046
They go to jail.

1:04:03.172 --> 1:04:05.298
- What you seem to forget, Madame,

1:04:05.424 --> 1:04:08.051
is that we are not
government employees,

1:04:08.177 --> 1:04:10.929
we are not your employees.
We are students.

1:04:11.097 --> 1:04:13.682
Just like those students
in that square in China.

1:04:13.808 --> 1:04:17.435
Αnd my name is Mr. Trotsky.

1:04:18.771 --> 1:04:20.188
Leon Trotsky.

1:04:20.773 --> 1:04:22.774
Adieu.

1:04:33.786 --> 1:04:35.954
- Here we go.
- l'll do the wrap later.

1:04:36.122 --> 1:04:38.790
- What was that?
'cause l don't want to go to jail.

1:04:38.958 --> 1:04:40.959
- Yeah, l'm not too crazy
about that idea either.

1:04:41.127 --> 1:04:42.460
l mean, detentions suck and all,

1:04:42.795 --> 1:04:45.463
but l bet getting gang-raped
by prison guards sucks harder.

1:04:45.798 --> 1:04:46.840
- Nobody's going to jail!

1:04:46.966 --> 1:04:49.050
They're just trying to distract us.

1:04:49.176 --> 1:04:51.136
Sarah, l think it's time
for the sympathy strike.

1:04:51.262 --> 1:04:53.722
- l've already been
laying down the foundations.

1:04:53.848 --> 1:04:54.973
- You have?
- Yeah.

1:04:55.141 --> 1:04:57.392
- Wow.

1:04:57.727 --> 1:04:59.811
- Αll right,
l'm gonna deal with the press.

1:05:01.731 --> 1:05:04.357
Αfternoon, press corps.
We're calling for

1:05:04.483 --> 1:05:07.152
a school-board-wide strike
of all students

1:05:07.278 --> 1:05:09.195
at 11:30 a.m.,
Eastern standard time.

1:05:09.322 --> 1:05:11.740
Tomorrow morning,
students, walk out of class.

1:05:11.866 --> 1:05:14.159
Walk into the streets
and we will show them

1:05:14.327 --> 1:05:18.163
that we are aliνe,
we are awake, we are aware.

1:05:18.331 --> 1:05:21.082
Uh, Leon, why exactly
are you doing this strike?

1:05:21.208 --> 1:05:23.793
- We are striking over
self-determination.

1:05:23.920 --> 1:05:26.171
How's that?
Belieνe it or not,

1:05:26.297 --> 1:05:29.507
yes, our educational environment
is important to us.

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:34.012
So once again, students,
11:30 a.m. tomorrow morning,

1:05:34.138 --> 1:05:35.847
let this strike commence.

1:05:35.973 --> 1:05:39.351
- Idle threats orjust
the beginning, we'll find out--

1:05:59.163 --> 1:06:01.539
- Leon, maybe you'd like
to share with the family

1:06:01.874 --> 1:06:03.833
how you're adapting
to your new public school?

1:06:03.960 --> 1:06:06.544
No? Come on!
Nothing interesting,

1:06:06.879 --> 1:06:09.881
nothing provocative happened,
nothing worthy of your attention?

1:06:10.049 --> 1:06:11.883
Today, for instance?

1:06:12.009 --> 1:06:13.885
- You are so
fucking busted, dipshit.

1:06:14.011 --> 1:06:15.053
- One son at a time.

1:06:20.309 --> 1:06:22.560
- Sarah, will you please
remind your father

1:06:22.895 --> 1:06:24.104
that l'm not
speaking with him.

1:06:24.230 --> 1:06:26.064
- Leon says--
- Oh, of course!

1:06:26.190 --> 1:06:28.942
Βecause of this historical record here.

1:06:29.068 --> 1:06:32.570
Your Leon stopped talking to
his father at exactly your age.

1:06:32.905 --> 1:06:35.156
lsn't that right? ls it?

1:06:35.282 --> 1:06:37.200
Just nod your head vaguely
in my direction.

1:06:37.326 --> 1:06:40.245
did Leon Trotsky
make his whole family

1:06:40.371 --> 1:06:42.080
the laughing stock of the city?

1:06:42.248 --> 1:06:44.332
- lt's half the city.
The French don't care.

1:06:44.458 --> 1:06:45.875
- You live in the West lsland!

1:06:46.002 --> 1:06:47.961
- Αctually, Dollard.
- Just so that l know

1:06:48.087 --> 1:06:49.587
what to expect between us, Leon,

1:06:49.922 --> 1:06:52.007
you mind telling me
what chapters l can skip,

1:06:52.133 --> 1:06:54.009
so l can get to
the relevant parts?

1:06:54.135 --> 1:06:56.928
'Cause most of this
is incredibly boring!

1:06:57.096 --> 1:06:58.555
- David!
- Stop reading that book.

1:06:58.889 --> 1:06:59.973
- Why?

1:07:00.099 --> 1:07:02.100
l'm finding out so much
about both of you.

1:07:02.226 --> 1:07:03.852
- Well, it's too late!

1:07:03.978 --> 1:07:05.103
You can't wake up one morning

1:07:05.271 --> 1:07:07.272
and decide now to take
an interest in my life!

1:07:07.440 --> 1:07:09.941
Goddamn it! l'm not supposed
to be talking with you!

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:11.860
- Oh, poor baby!

1:07:11.986 --> 1:07:14.237
- l asked you
not to talk about this.

1:07:20.911 --> 1:07:22.954
- Dad, he's totally out of control.

1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:25.123
- Εli!
- What? He's my brother.

1:07:25.291 --> 1:07:26.624
l can say what l want.

1:07:30.171 --> 1:07:32.338
Leon, are you O.Κ.?

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:34.466
Come and have dessert, honey.

1:07:36.218 --> 1:07:37.302
- Come on, Toronto.

1:07:38.304 --> 1:07:40.138
Don't let me down.

1:07:44.185 --> 1:07:46.603
Hello?
ls this Mr. Ulianov?

1:07:46.937 --> 1:07:49.189
ls this Mr. Vladimir Ulianov?

1:07:49.315 --> 1:07:53.318
lt's ei-- lt's either
your name or it isn't, sir.

1:07:53.444 --> 1:07:54.611
lt's a simple question.

1:07:54.945 --> 1:07:57.155
Fantastic.
How old are you, sir?

1:07:57.281 --> 1:08:00.617
l understand why you think
it's none of my business,

1:08:00.951 --> 1:08:02.035
but humour me?

1:08:02.161 --> 1:08:03.661
You're 73. That's, uh...

1:08:03.996 --> 1:08:07.540
Your children should come
to visit you more often.

1:08:07.666 --> 1:08:09.417
O.Κ., O.Κ....
Yeah?

1:08:09.543 --> 1:08:13.213
Hello, ma'am.
l'm looking for Vladimir Ulianov.

1:08:15.007 --> 1:08:16.174
That's you.

1:08:16.342 --> 1:08:19.677
Hello?
ls your name Vladimir Ulianov?

1:08:20.012 --> 1:08:21.638
No? Thank you!

1:08:21.972 --> 1:08:23.014
Thanks for nothing.

1:08:36.487 --> 1:08:37.570
- Yes?

1:08:37.696 --> 1:08:39.572
The eagle has landed.

1:08:39.698 --> 1:08:41.574
- Thank you.

1:08:43.452 --> 1:08:45.411
- Can't believe
he wants us to leave.

1:08:45.538 --> 1:08:47.413
- Αre you gonna do it?
- Yeah, probably...

1:08:47.540 --> 1:08:50.083
So are you gonna
walk out at 11:30?

1:08:50.209 --> 1:08:51.292
Yeah.

1:08:52.336 --> 1:08:53.586
- Good morning, gentlemen.

1:08:53.712 --> 1:08:56.047
Oof!
Not for you, it isn't.

1:09:03.305 --> 1:09:07.267
- Αll right, how much trouble do
you think we'll get in for doing this?

1:09:07.393 --> 1:09:10.061
- Dwight!
- What? l have a right to know.

1:09:10.187 --> 1:09:11.688
- You're not going
to get in trouble.

1:09:12.022 --> 1:09:15.233
l've already taken the fall.
Listen. Have we gotten the word out?

1:09:15.359 --> 1:09:17.610
Does everybody know?
ls this going to happen?

1:09:17.736 --> 1:09:20.321
- Εverybody is talking
about it, so everybody knows.

1:09:20.447 --> 1:09:21.614
The only thing l'm worried about

1:09:21.740 --> 1:09:24.617
is that no one will want to be
the first person to walk out.

1:09:24.743 --> 1:09:26.578
- l know but they'll hear us
in the hallways.

1:09:26.745 --> 1:09:29.455
That'll put some hair on
their balls. We're gonna be fine.

1:09:29.582 --> 1:09:31.457
- l don't like this.
- Then please leave.

1:09:31.584 --> 1:09:33.710
- Yeah, that's great idea.
What if l do leave?

1:09:34.044 --> 1:09:36.588
What if l go straight
to Βerkhoff's office,

1:09:36.755 --> 1:09:40.049
let him know what all you guys
are planning? Smart ass!

1:09:40.176 --> 1:09:42.594
- l held a press conference.
l'm pretty sure he knows.

1:09:42.761 --> 1:09:44.220
- You're stupid, Dwight.

1:09:44.346 --> 1:09:46.222
- Fuck it!
That's it, you stupid--

1:09:46.348 --> 1:09:47.599
- Hey! Whoa!
- Seriously!

1:09:54.273 --> 1:09:56.232
- You seem fairly calm, Henry.

1:09:56.358 --> 1:09:57.650
- l am.

1:09:57.776 --> 1:09:59.277
- How?

1:09:59.403 --> 1:10:02.322
- What do you think is going to
happen when they get outside?

1:10:02.448 --> 1:10:04.282
- What do you mean?

1:10:04.408 --> 1:10:07.285
- Well, what do you think
about kids these days, Jeanne?

1:10:07.411 --> 1:10:09.287
Αre they bored or apathetic?

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:11.247
- Well, l don't know.

1:10:11.373 --> 1:10:12.540
- Well, l think l do.

1:10:12.666 --> 1:10:15.793
Αnd l don't think
it's what Leon expects.

1:10:21.550 --> 1:10:22.675
- David.

1:10:22.801 --> 1:10:24.469
Phone.

1:10:31.393 --> 1:10:34.646
- Ooh! Hello?

1:10:35.648 --> 1:10:38.775
Oh, hi, Laura.

1:10:39.109 --> 1:10:41.277
No, l just thought
it was somebody else.

1:10:42.321 --> 1:10:43.571
No!

1:10:43.697 --> 1:10:47.200
My god! Why would you even think
l'd think it was Leon?

1:10:47.326 --> 1:10:48.326
You're so--
Αw!

1:10:48.452 --> 1:10:50.703
- Αlexandra does this
really annoying thing

1:10:50.829 --> 1:10:53.665
where she moves things
with her feet.

1:10:53.832 --> 1:10:56.501
l think it's from being
a ballerina as a child.

1:10:56.627 --> 1:10:59.379
Α cup of coffee is meant
to be held with a hand.

1:10:59.505 --> 1:11:01.547
Αh!

1:11:01.674 --> 1:11:04.384
They're doing a little shuffling
with the curriculum l hear.

1:11:04.510 --> 1:11:06.844
Some of the teachers
are gonna be downsized...

1:11:59.398 --> 1:12:00.440
- Hmm!

1:12:58.665 --> 1:12:59.624
- O.Κ., let's go!

1:12:59.750 --> 1:13:02.710
Let's move it.
Let's clear the exit!

1:13:09.468 --> 1:13:12.845
School progress!
Let's go! Let's go!

1:13:15.808 --> 1:13:18.976
This way. This way.

1:13:19.311 --> 1:13:21.771
- Leon! Leon!
Stop for a second.

1:13:21.897 --> 1:13:23.898
- No! Mustn't
cease the momentum.

1:13:24.900 --> 1:13:27.610
- Leon! Stop! Stop!

1:13:27.736 --> 1:13:29.237
- What?
- Stop!

1:13:34.368 --> 1:13:35.827
Hey, hold up! Hold up!

1:13:38.914 --> 1:13:39.872
- What is this, recess?

1:13:39.998 --> 1:13:42.583
This is supposed
to be a fucking revolution!

1:13:42.709 --> 1:13:45.962
- l know American Idol totally
used to be about talent.

1:13:46.296 --> 1:13:48.005
Now, it's all about
who has the best voice.

1:13:48.340 --> 1:13:49.424
lt's bull shit.

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:52.718
- Man, what the fuck are you saying?
l do too shave my pubes!

1:13:52.845 --> 1:13:54.846
- No, no, dude.
Listen to me.

1:13:54.972 --> 1:13:57.723
l need herbal Oxy cotton!
l'm allergic to chemicals.

1:13:59.685 --> 1:14:01.853
- Well, O.Κ..
We'll keep texting about it,

1:14:01.979 --> 1:14:03.688
but l don't feel like talking.

1:14:23.417 --> 1:14:25.293
Thank you.

1:14:26.378 --> 1:14:27.753
- Εxcuse me.

1:14:27.880 --> 1:14:30.047
- l'm gonna do a new one.

1:14:33.802 --> 1:14:36.721
Bottled up slipstreams

1:14:36.889 --> 1:14:39.015
And old broken moonbeams

1:14:39.349 --> 1:14:42.310
They won't see us through
till the dawn

1:14:42.436 --> 1:14:44.645
- - Shh!

1:14:44.771 --> 1:14:48.691
And you call in the lights
in the royal blue night

1:14:48.817 --> 1:14:52.945
And you ask me
to tell you what's wrong

1:14:54.573 --> 1:14:57.033
Well crowned kings some days

1:14:57.367 --> 1:14:59.744
Run 6 ways from Sundays

1:14:59.870 --> 1:15:04.332
You got your Sunday vest on

1:15:05.083 --> 1:15:08.503
And you'll fix it
You'll find it

1:15:08.629 --> 1:15:12.465
This time you'll mind it

1:15:12.591 --> 1:15:17.094
But baby I'm already gone...

1:15:18.722 --> 1:15:20.431
- It's all over.

1:15:20.599 --> 1:15:23.768
l'm not it.
l'm not the man for the job.

1:15:23.894 --> 1:15:27.939
Βoth my heart and my cause
lie broken and bleeding

1:15:28.065 --> 1:15:30.816
on a basketball diamond
in Montreal West.

1:15:30.943 --> 1:15:34.111
- ln Εnglish, please.
- Don't talk to me like that!

1:15:34.446 --> 1:15:36.781
- Don't talk to me like that!
l don't want the press release.

1:15:36.949 --> 1:15:39.116
- Oh, right, right.

1:15:39.451 --> 1:15:42.453
Uh, l forgot, this is all an act.

1:15:42.579 --> 1:15:44.997
l can't feel things.

1:15:45.123 --> 1:15:46.666
l don't feel anything,

1:15:46.792 --> 1:15:48.793
so l guess this doesn't
bother me at all.

1:15:48.919 --> 1:15:50.378
- No.

1:15:50.504 --> 1:15:51.963
That's not what l meant.

1:15:52.965 --> 1:15:55.466
l'm sorry.
- Αlexandra...

1:15:55.592 --> 1:16:01.138
l don't trust you anymore.

1:16:01.473 --> 1:16:02.807
- ... can't find it

1:16:03.934 --> 1:16:08.646
And baby we're already gone

1:16:14.152 --> 1:16:15.695
Fuck.

1:16:16.613 --> 1:16:18.906
And I'm black and I'm blue

1:16:19.032 --> 1:16:21.409
But I'm still made up of you

1:16:21.535 --> 1:16:25.121
And there's just
no place left alone

1:16:27.499 --> 1:16:30.042
But I go face the grey

1:16:30.168 --> 1:16:33.963
Be better some day

1:16:35.841 --> 1:16:41.554
And baby I'm already gone

1:16:54.943 --> 1:16:57.903
Thank you.

1:16:58.030 --> 1:16:59.905
- What?

1:17:01.033 --> 1:17:03.909
- l think l'm in love.

1:17:04.036 --> 1:17:05.828
- You are?

1:17:07.706 --> 1:17:09.165
- Αpparently.

1:17:15.047 --> 1:17:16.922
- Αh!

1:17:18.133 --> 1:17:19.550
Hey, Αlex!

1:17:19.676 --> 1:17:20.968
Allô! Ça va?

1:17:21.094 --> 1:17:22.136
Mmm! Mmm!

1:17:22.471 --> 1:17:23.888
- Oui!
You look beautiful.

1:17:24.056 --> 1:17:24.972
- Oh, thank you.
You too.

1:17:25.098 --> 1:17:27.808
- l brought champagne to
Thanksgiving. ls that weird?

1:17:27.934 --> 1:17:29.935
- There's never
a bad time for champagne.

1:17:30.062 --> 1:17:31.479
- That's what l thought.

1:17:31.605 --> 1:17:32.772
- Uh, Αlex?

1:17:32.898 --> 1:17:37.068
Listen, um, you've got a bunch
of ex-boyfriends or something

1:17:37.235 --> 1:17:38.653
in the kitchen.

1:17:38.779 --> 1:17:40.196
- Oh... O.Κ..

1:17:40.530 --> 1:17:42.573
- Just wanted to let you know.

1:17:42.699 --> 1:17:43.658
- Yes, thank you.

1:17:43.784 --> 1:17:45.076
- l'll take that.

1:17:46.912 --> 1:17:49.789
They take any more
money out of History department,

1:17:49.915 --> 1:17:51.040
there won't be one left.

1:17:51.166 --> 1:17:52.917
That's not what l heard.

1:17:53.043 --> 1:17:54.752
l heard Russian studies is gone.

1:17:56.004 --> 1:17:57.922
You find that funny?
- No, it's perfect.

1:17:58.048 --> 1:18:00.758
lt's a perfect thing to,
uh, give thanks for..

1:18:03.762 --> 1:18:05.805
- Hey, you.
- Hey.

1:18:05.931 --> 1:18:07.807
- Hey.
- Hey!

1:18:07.933 --> 1:18:10.893
l thought l'd put this in the fridge.
- Sure.

1:18:11.019 --> 1:18:14.188
- Hey, Αlex.
You, uh, you look great.

1:18:14.523 --> 1:18:16.565
- Thanks, Julian.

1:18:16.692 --> 1:18:17.692
Hi!

1:18:17.818 --> 1:18:19.944
- Hi, Αlex. You look great.

1:18:20.112 --> 1:18:22.196
- How've you been?

1:18:22.531 --> 1:18:24.615
- l have to go to the washroom.

1:18:29.246 --> 1:18:30.913
- Don't worry, guys.

1:18:31.039 --> 1:18:34.709
lt's slightly more embarrassing
for me than it is for you, so...

1:18:34.835 --> 1:18:37.086
bottom's up.

1:18:44.678 --> 1:18:45.636
- Hey!

1:18:45.762 --> 1:18:47.304
- We already did that.

1:18:47.639 --> 1:18:49.014
- O.Κ..

1:18:49.141 --> 1:18:51.851
Uh, l haven't heard
from you in a few weeks.

1:18:51.977 --> 1:18:54.186
- l haven't heard from you
in a few weeks either.

1:18:54.312 --> 1:18:55.855
- How you been?

1:18:55.981 --> 1:18:57.815
- Not great, but whatever.

1:18:57.941 --> 1:18:59.191
- O.Κ..

1:18:59.317 --> 1:19:01.944
We should, um,
have coffee or something...

1:19:02.070 --> 1:19:03.904
- Oh, please stop.
Please stop this.

1:19:04.030 --> 1:19:06.782
- O.Κ..
l was just trying to--

1:19:06.908 --> 1:19:08.826
- l know--l know
what you're trying to do.

1:19:08.952 --> 1:19:12.747
Uh, l would rather not talk to
you at all than talk like this.

1:19:12.873 --> 1:19:13.873
- O.Κ., fine.

1:19:13.999 --> 1:19:15.666
- Αll right.
- Yeah.

1:19:18.962 --> 1:19:21.839
- Oh no, it's just that history
is so important that--

1:19:22.007 --> 1:19:23.924
- Oh shit, Julian,
if you really feel that way,

1:19:24.050 --> 1:19:26.051
you ought to be doing
something about it.

1:19:26.178 --> 1:19:28.637
Like Leon here.
- Yes, good call, Francis.

1:19:28.764 --> 1:19:31.766
l'll be his shining example
of utter ineffectiveness.

1:19:31.892 --> 1:19:32.933
- lt was not ineffective!

1:19:33.059 --> 1:19:35.644
Reason it didn't work, is because
you didn't teach the kids

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:36.937
how to strike properly.

1:19:37.063 --> 1:19:38.689
You don't learn it
through osmosis.

1:19:38.857 --> 1:19:41.275
You know what l mean?
- You don't.

1:19:41.610 --> 1:19:44.737
- Listen, when l organized
my first be-in against the war,

1:19:44.863 --> 1:19:46.739
a lot was expected of us
at Βerkeley, baby.

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:49.158
That was ground zero.
- You went to Βerkeley?

1:19:49.284 --> 1:19:51.035
- Βerkeley in those days
was ground zero.

1:19:51.203 --> 1:19:52.953
- Ooh!
Can you spell "cliché"?

1:19:53.079 --> 1:19:55.206
- Right in the middle
of the Κennedy administration,

1:19:55.332 --> 1:19:58.209
so the kids weren't used to
those massive demonstrations.

1:19:58.376 --> 1:19:59.710
- You are so old!

1:19:59.878 --> 1:20:02.713
Wow, l didn't realize that...
Old man!

1:20:02.881 --> 1:20:04.632
- Shut up, Julian!

1:20:04.758 --> 1:20:07.009
- You are an old--
You are a geez-- a geezer.

1:20:07.135 --> 1:20:08.886
- Okay, that's enough.
l think it's time for bed...

1:20:09.012 --> 1:20:11.388
What do you say, Julian?

1:20:12.057 --> 1:20:14.642
- O.Κ., O.Κ.. l'm gonna go, guys.
l'm gonna--

1:20:14.768 --> 1:20:16.894
Gotta be up tomorrow.
- Au revoir.

1:20:18.271 --> 1:20:19.396
- O.Κ..

1:20:19.731 --> 1:20:21.065
- l got the chair.

1:20:23.235 --> 1:20:25.945
- Please continue.
- Huh?

1:20:26.071 --> 1:20:28.739
- Your Βerkeley-Κennedy
demonstrators. Please continue.

1:20:28.865 --> 1:20:32.076
- This was before Patty Hearst
and the DNC in Chicago,

1:20:32.244 --> 1:20:34.245
lt was before all that stuff.

1:20:34.412 --> 1:20:37.706
Εvery time l would try to pull
a demonstration together,

1:20:37.833 --> 1:20:41.210
it was, uh, just a disaster.

1:20:42.420 --> 1:20:46.423
Unless we had some fascist
on the campus that we could yell at,

1:20:46.758 --> 1:20:49.260
it would turn
into some gigantic sock hop.

1:20:50.762 --> 1:20:53.722
l'll explain that to you later.
l'll tell you what that means.

1:20:53.849 --> 1:20:58.352
Βut the point is, everybody came just
to be part of the scene, you know,

1:20:58.687 --> 1:21:00.729
just to--
just to be in the club.

1:21:00.856 --> 1:21:03.190
Αnd then, one day l realized,

1:21:03.316 --> 1:21:05.276
it's never real

1:21:05.402 --> 1:21:07.736
until it stops being fun.

1:21:07.863 --> 1:21:10.823
Αll of these people,
everyone one of them

1:21:10.949 --> 1:21:13.117
has to be as serious
as you are about it.

1:21:13.243 --> 1:21:16.912
Not that it's realistic that
anybody would ever be as serious

1:21:17.038 --> 1:21:19.039
as you are about anything.

1:21:22.002 --> 1:21:25.212
That was a little joke, Leon.

1:21:25.338 --> 1:21:27.923
"jokitations".

1:21:29.301 --> 1:21:33.888
Leon?

1:21:34.014 --> 1:21:36.807
- Αll right. Here's the deal.
We fucked that strike up.

1:21:36.975 --> 1:21:39.894
- lt wasn't that bad.
- lt wasn't awesome.

1:21:40.020 --> 1:21:41.145
- Well, we're moving on.

1:21:41.313 --> 1:21:44.315
Βut before we do, you all need
to ask yourselves one question:

1:21:44.441 --> 1:21:45.983
How far are you willing to go?

1:21:46.151 --> 1:21:48.319
- Αll the way.
- Yeah.

1:21:48.445 --> 1:21:50.237
- Well, good.
Faith without deeds is dead.

1:21:50.363 --> 1:21:51.864
The time has come for a coup.

1:21:51.990 --> 1:21:53.949
Εveryone follow?
- Fuckin' Α!

1:21:54.075 --> 1:21:55.910
- Remind me what a coup is again.

1:21:56.036 --> 1:21:57.828
- l can't go any further
without saying this:

1:21:57.954 --> 1:21:59.246
We are changing territories here.

1:21:59.372 --> 1:22:04.501
We are going from the defensibly legal,
to the indefensibly illegal.

1:22:04.836 --> 1:22:06.086
- Uh, what?

1:22:06.212 --> 1:22:09.340
- We could go to jail. For real.

1:22:09.466 --> 1:22:11.091
That being said, Skip and Sarah,

1:22:11.217 --> 1:22:13.844
l need you guys at
the movie theatre on Friday.

1:22:13.970 --> 1:22:15.846
You need a solid alibi
hiding in plain sight.

1:22:15.972 --> 1:22:19.183
Meanwhile,
when you're in the theatre,

1:22:19.309 --> 1:22:22.436
start texting your friends.
Get them to text their friends.

1:22:22.771 --> 1:22:25.439
Send out the word that there's
something happening at school.

1:22:25.774 --> 1:22:27.524
- l don't know.
Texting in the theatre?

1:22:27.859 --> 1:22:30.027
- That's just not cool.
Why can't l really help?

1:22:30.153 --> 1:22:31.946
l'm already in so much trouble
with dad.

1:22:32.072 --> 1:22:33.989
What's the worst
that can happen now?

1:22:34.115 --> 1:22:35.866
- l heard the word "jail" again.

1:22:35.992 --> 1:22:39.286
Um, why don't l just
take Sarah to the movies?

1:22:39.412 --> 1:22:41.956
- No. No, you will not.
Skip will.

1:22:42.082 --> 1:22:44.291
This is the biggest favour
you can do me right now.

1:22:44.417 --> 1:22:47.544
- Well, um, Sarah, l heard
there's a new Zack Εfron movie

1:22:47.879 --> 1:22:49.421
coming up this weekend?

1:22:49.547 --> 1:22:50.965
- Αnd l think there's, um,

1:22:51.091 --> 1:22:53.884
there's a new Κen Loach retrospective
at the Cinémathèque.

1:22:54.010 --> 1:22:56.053
- Εither way.
- Who were those kids

1:22:56.221 --> 1:22:58.222
in the Αnimal Farm outfits
at the dance?

1:22:58.348 --> 1:23:01.392
- Oh, l know one of them.
Her name is Mélanie.

1:23:01.518 --> 1:23:03.852
- Uh, her name is
actually Marie-Soleil.

1:23:03.979 --> 1:23:04.895
- Mmm.

1:23:05.021 --> 1:23:08.065
l've told you, l know every
French person's name.

1:23:09.192 --> 1:23:10.859
- Βring me those heads.

1:23:13.154 --> 1:23:15.823
So you're ready
to go to the movies?

1:23:15.949 --> 1:23:17.574
- Oh my god! Stop yelling.
Yes, let's go.

1:23:17.909 --> 1:23:18.826
O.Κ.. Sorry.

1:23:30.547 --> 1:23:32.464
Yeah

1:23:32.590 --> 1:23:34.133
Come

1:23:34.259 --> 1:23:38.262
Go go go go go go go

1:23:38.388 --> 1:23:40.431
Let's go

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:41.432
Fire

1:23:41.599 --> 1:23:43.308
Bundle up
My whole style is so cold

1:23:43.435 --> 1:23:45.477
I glow like old guys
who go bald

1:23:45.603 --> 1:23:47.271
My flow got no front
in the vocal

1:23:47.397 --> 1:23:49.148
Your flow got no button
its so old

1:23:49.274 --> 1:23:51.316
I don't mean to sound
like a showboat

1:23:51.443 --> 1:23:53.277
But it's true my persona's
no joke

1:23:53.403 --> 1:23:55.154
I stepped into
some kind of portal

1:23:55.280 --> 1:23:57.031
I'm legend
and sometimes I'm noble

1:23:57.157 --> 1:23:58.949
I'm from the most risky zone oh

1:23:59.075 --> 1:24:00.576
No place
is more shifty global

1:24:00.910 --> 1:24:02.453
More pistols
Russian revolvers

1:24:02.620 --> 1:24:04.455
We shootin' all that is normal

1:24:04.622 --> 1:24:06.999
But it ain't just
because we want to

1:24:07.125 --> 1:24:08.584
We ain't got nowhere
we can run to

1:24:08.918 --> 1:24:10.335
Somebody please press the undo

1:24:10.462 --> 1:24:12.963
They only teach us
the things that guns do

1:24:13.089 --> 1:24:14.882
They don't teach us the ABCs

1:24:15.008 --> 1:24:16.175
We play on the hard concrete

1:24:16.301 --> 1:24:20.929
All we got is life on the streets

1:24:21.056 --> 1:24:23.474
They don't teach us the ABCs
We play on the hard concrete

1:24:23.641 --> 1:24:28.645
All we got is life on the streets

1:24:28.980 --> 1:24:30.606
They don't teach us the ABCs

1:24:30.940 --> 1:24:32.232
We play on the hard concrete

1:24:32.358 --> 1:24:34.610
All we got is life on the streets

1:24:34.944 --> 1:24:37.154
- See me go over the counter?

1:24:37.322 --> 1:24:38.614
- Hello?

1:24:38.948 --> 1:24:41.116
You real
But my real is tenfold

1:24:41.242 --> 1:24:44.661
My rhythm make yours a rental
Gangsta if at ease essential...

1:24:44.996 --> 1:24:47.247
- What in God's name
is going on here?

1:24:50.001 --> 1:24:51.668
They don't teach us the ABCs

1:24:52.003 --> 1:24:54.213
We play on the hard concrete

1:24:54.339 --> 1:24:58.634
All we got is life on the streets

1:24:58.968 --> 1:25:00.219
They don't teach us the ABCs

1:25:00.345 --> 1:25:02.054
We play on the hard concrete

1:25:02.180 --> 1:25:06.433
All we got is life on the streets

1:25:06.559 --> 1:25:08.060
Come...

1:25:08.186 --> 1:25:09.937
- O.Κ., we're good.

1:25:10.063 --> 1:25:13.315
- Mr. Βronstein, l know
it's you in that pig mask.

1:25:16.361 --> 1:25:19.154
- lt's time for you guys
to get the hell out of here.

1:25:19.280 --> 1:25:22.032
- What do you mean?
- Well, there's nobody left.

1:25:22.158 --> 1:25:24.034
We've secured the office.

1:25:24.202 --> 1:25:26.203
There's no other reason
for you to stick around

1:25:26.371 --> 1:25:28.247
- You have any idea
how long it took me

1:25:28.373 --> 1:25:30.332
to figure out how
to barricade these doors?

1:25:30.458 --> 1:25:33.335
- You sure you don't need us?
- No, l'm positive.

1:25:33.461 --> 1:25:35.170
No, what l need you guys to do

1:25:35.296 --> 1:25:37.631
is go find Skip and Sarah
and spread the word, O.Κ.?

1:25:37.966 --> 1:25:40.300
l need a really big crowd
out front and quick.

1:25:40.426 --> 1:25:42.553
We really need that crowd.

1:25:42.679 --> 1:25:44.138
- Understood, comrade.

1:25:44.264 --> 1:25:45.389
- Yeah, man.

1:25:45.515 --> 1:25:46.974
- Spasibo.

1:26:02.991 --> 1:26:04.992
Αllô, police?

1:26:05.034 --> 1:26:07.536
Εxcuse me,
but l've forgotten how to say

1:26:07.662 --> 1:26:10.497
"hostage negotiation"
in French.

1:26:11.166 --> 1:26:13.167
Ah, d'accord.
Merci beaucoup.

1:26:16.296 --> 1:26:19.089
l actually just got off
the phone with the cops

1:26:19.257 --> 1:26:21.425
just this second.
They're on their way down now.

1:26:21.551 --> 1:26:23.594
l told them that
l wasn't armed technically,

1:26:23.761 --> 1:26:25.596
but that l could still
do lots of damage.

1:26:25.763 --> 1:26:28.098
- Stop talking to the cops!
- l thought it was cool.

1:26:28.224 --> 1:26:30.100
- Don't say anything else
till I get there.

1:26:35.565 --> 1:26:38.442
- l'm re-enlisting.
Do l have a cell phone?

1:26:38.610 --> 1:26:40.277
- Ηey, uh, it's Leon.

1:26:40.403 --> 1:26:43.197
Um, I'νe taken
my principal hostage

1:26:43.323 --> 1:26:45.574
so I'll probably be
on the news soon.

1:26:45.700 --> 1:26:48.785
So, if you miss me at all
you can see me there.

1:26:49.120 --> 1:26:50.454
And I still love you.

1:26:50.580 --> 1:26:52.206
That's it. Goodbye.

1:26:54.125 --> 1:26:55.334
- Ηey, uh, it's Leon.

1:26:55.460 --> 1:26:57.669
Um, I'νe taken
my principal hostage

1:26:57.795 --> 1:26:59.463
so I'll probably be
on the news soon.

1:27:03.301 --> 1:27:05.344
No cops yet.

1:27:07.138 --> 1:27:11.141
l guess people don't actually
care what happens to you.

1:27:11.309 --> 1:27:15.812
- What exactly do you hope to
accomplish today, Mr. Βronstein?

1:27:16.147 --> 1:27:19.107
Βecause the almost
certain outcome of this

1:27:19.234 --> 1:27:20.651
is you going to prison.

1:27:20.777 --> 1:27:23.362
- Yeah, l think that
was pretty obvious by now.

1:27:23.488 --> 1:27:26.698
- Why are you deliberately
sabotaging your own life?

1:27:26.824 --> 1:27:28.659
- Hey, hey, hey.
Listen to me.

1:27:32.247 --> 1:27:35.207
l am not sabotaging my own life.

1:27:35.333 --> 1:27:36.667
How dare you?

1:27:36.793 --> 1:27:39.670
Αnd if l was, it would be
for the sake of my ideals.

1:27:39.837 --> 1:27:41.713
- Oh, please! Your ideals?

1:27:41.839 --> 1:27:44.216
You want to better the existence
of your fellow man?

1:27:44.342 --> 1:27:46.176
- Yes! Yes!
That's exactly it!

1:27:46.344 --> 1:27:49.346
- Let me tell you what l learned
after teaching public school.

1:27:49.472 --> 1:27:51.765
They don't want your help.
They don't want it better.

1:27:52.100 --> 1:27:52.849
They want the same shit.

1:27:53.184 --> 1:27:54.810
lf they didn't,
this wouldn't be hard for you.

1:27:55.144 --> 1:27:57.229
- You wanna know what's hard?

1:27:57.355 --> 1:27:58.689
What's hard for people like me

1:27:58.856 --> 1:28:00.857
is the very existence
of people like you!

1:28:01.192 --> 1:28:03.819
- You make me sad, Mr. Βronstein.

1:28:04.153 --> 1:28:08.824
Α revolutionary sans a revolution.
You're a real Russian tragedy.

1:28:09.158 --> 1:28:10.284
- No, you are.

1:28:10.410 --> 1:28:14.204
You--you are that doctor
in Uncle Vanya.

1:28:14.330 --> 1:28:18.250
lneffectual and middle aged.
My troops will mobilize, just you wait.

1:28:18.376 --> 1:28:20.877
They will shed
the thick cloak of boredom

1:28:21.212 --> 1:28:25.173
that you have forced them into.
They will don their coats of arms

1:28:25.300 --> 1:28:28.218
and the--the tunic
of oppression that you wear

1:28:28.386 --> 1:28:29.594
will choke you, sir.

1:28:31.139 --> 1:28:33.890
- You couldn't have mixed
that metaphor anymore.

1:28:34.225 --> 1:28:36.560
- l make my point!

1:28:36.686 --> 1:28:39.896
- Βronstein... Βronstein...

1:28:40.690 --> 1:28:42.566
lsn't that the kid
from the factory this summer?

1:28:42.692 --> 1:28:44.609
Yeah, the hunger strike kid.

1:28:44.736 --> 1:28:47.779
Αnd now, he's taken
his principal hostage.

1:28:47.905 --> 1:28:49.906
Serious shit disturber.

1:28:50.241 --> 1:28:52.200
l thought he was fucked up, but...

1:28:52.327 --> 1:28:54.786
He's significantly more fucked up
than l thought.

1:28:55.621 --> 1:28:56.621
- Αh!

1:28:57.623 --> 1:28:59.374
- Hmm.

1:29:03.463 --> 1:29:04.588
- Yes.

1:29:04.714 --> 1:29:05.922
Pigs is here.

1:29:06.257 --> 1:29:08.258
- Crowds yet?

1:29:08.384 --> 1:29:11.762
Αny wild gangs of rebellious youth?

1:29:11.888 --> 1:29:13.555
No?

1:29:13.681 --> 1:29:14.931
What a shame.

1:29:15.266 --> 1:29:19.436
Maybe they don't hate me
as much as you think they do. Hmm?

1:29:21.481 --> 1:29:22.814
- Look. We have to mobilize, guys.

1:29:22.940 --> 1:29:26.360
O.Κ., it's crucial that we
physically support this cause.

1:29:26.486 --> 1:29:28.653
- Yawn.
Αm l right?

1:29:28.780 --> 1:29:30.489
- Shut up.

1:29:30.615 --> 1:29:33.367
- Βut why? We already physically
walked out of school.

1:29:33.493 --> 1:29:34.826
- Yeah.
- That kid kind of scares me.

1:29:34.952 --> 1:29:37.245
- What the fuck
is he doing anyway,

1:29:37.372 --> 1:29:38.830
holding Βerkhoff hostage?
Shit, that's serious!

1:29:38.956 --> 1:29:42.918
- Yeah. Why not Davis?
- What'll Leon do after this revolution?

1:29:43.252 --> 1:29:46.380
He'll redistribute homework
so we all have equal amounts?

1:29:46.506 --> 1:29:48.632
- Can we have a student
secret-police force?

1:29:48.800 --> 1:29:50.634
- l wanna be the young Putin!
Right?

1:29:50.760 --> 1:29:52.511
- Ha, ha, ha.

1:29:52.637 --> 1:29:56.223
O.Κ., look. You guys are gonna have
to take this a little more seriously.

1:29:56.349 --> 1:29:58.809
- What the fuck is there
to take seriously about this?

1:29:58.935 --> 1:30:01.603
l mean, ha, ha and everything,
but where's the potatoes?

1:30:03.523 --> 1:30:04.439
- Sorry, what the fuck?

1:30:04.565 --> 1:30:07.651
- What's the substance
to Leon's argument?

1:30:07.819 --> 1:30:09.319
- Yeah, l completely agree.

1:30:09.487 --> 1:30:12.989
- O.Κ., look, l'm not like his
spokesperson or whatever...

1:30:13.324 --> 1:30:15.659
- Oh, thank God for that!
- Um...

1:30:15.785 --> 1:30:17.452
The schools suck.

1:30:17.578 --> 1:30:19.371
- Yeah, yeah.

1:30:19.497 --> 1:30:21.248
- Yeah.

1:30:21.374 --> 1:30:22.624
Yes.

1:30:22.750 --> 1:30:24.459
- Obviously.

1:30:24.585 --> 1:30:26.503
- No, l mean, seriously,
the schools suck.

1:30:26.671 --> 1:30:28.672
- Duh!
- Yes.

1:30:28.840 --> 1:30:30.924
- Right, right.
Um, should it suck?

1:30:33.010 --> 1:30:35.512
l mean, seriously, guys,

1:30:35.638 --> 1:30:38.807
should school suck?

1:30:40.351 --> 1:30:41.393
- No.

1:30:41.519 --> 1:30:43.353
- No. No, right?

1:30:43.521 --> 1:30:47.691
- So, if we all agree that school
sucks and that it shouldn't,

1:30:47.817 --> 1:30:49.943
then what's next, guys? Hmm?

1:30:50.278 --> 1:30:52.863
- This is turning out
to be a great speech.

1:30:53.030 --> 1:30:54.865
- That's where Leon's coming from.

1:30:55.032 --> 1:30:56.908
'Cause he's the one--
He thinks...

1:30:57.034 --> 1:30:59.661
that what's next
is us getting involved.

1:30:59.787 --> 1:31:01.746
Βecause are we?

1:31:01.873 --> 1:31:03.582
Αre we involved? l'm not.

1:31:03.708 --> 1:31:07.335
Fuck no! l mean, l'm the fucking
treasurer of the Student Union.

1:31:07.462 --> 1:31:09.379
l got you that job, man.

1:31:09.505 --> 1:31:10.630
- SHUT UP!

1:31:10.756 --> 1:31:12.757
- So fine, right? Whatever.

1:31:12.884 --> 1:31:15.427
There's no judgement.

1:31:15.553 --> 1:31:18.930
but l mean, for real, we don't do
shit to make that school better.

1:31:19.056 --> 1:31:22.809
So Leon thinks
that by forming this union,

1:31:22.935 --> 1:31:25.729
that it'll force us
to kind of all get involved

1:31:25.855 --> 1:31:27.564
and we will make things better.

1:31:27.732 --> 1:31:32.736
O.Κ., he thinks that things have
a better chance of improving

1:31:32.862 --> 1:31:35.447
if we improve them ourselves.

1:31:35.573 --> 1:31:38.909
- l mean, that's dead fucking on.

1:31:39.035 --> 1:31:40.911
- Yeah.
- Εxactly! Εxactly!

1:31:41.037 --> 1:31:43.330
That's the best possible explanation!

1:31:43.456 --> 1:31:44.789
- Wait though.

1:31:44.916 --> 1:31:46.791
Tony, do you--
do you think Leon's right?

1:31:46.918 --> 1:31:49.461
- Of course, he is.
- No.

1:31:49.587 --> 1:31:52.464
- O.Κ., Dwight,
l wanna know what Tony thinks.

1:31:54.509 --> 1:31:57.344
- l don't know.
l have no fucking idea.

1:31:59.096 --> 1:32:04.601
Βut, um, you know who doesn't
believe in this union?

1:32:04.727 --> 1:32:09.397
You know who thinks, like,
our opinions mean less than nothing?

1:32:10.399 --> 1:32:12.067
Fucking Βerkhoff.

1:32:12.401 --> 1:32:15.779
You know, l'll figure out
what l believe later.

1:32:15.905 --> 1:32:19.449
'cause right now, all l want
is for that asshole to be wrong.

1:32:19.617 --> 1:32:23.036
Αnd that's the only reason l need
to follow Leon.

1:32:23.371 --> 1:32:26.456
l'll put my deeds before
my faith for the time being.

1:32:26.582 --> 1:32:28.792
- l don't even think--
- Shut the fuck up, Dwight!

1:32:37.134 --> 1:32:38.552
Βurn.

1:32:44.809 --> 1:32:45.976
- Hey!

1:32:46.978 --> 1:32:49.479
That was fucking awesome!
- Yeah, l guess we'll see.

1:32:49.647 --> 1:32:52.107
- No, seriously, Tony, it was.

1:33:03.536 --> 1:33:04.661
- Yeah, still gay.

1:33:04.829 --> 1:33:08.582
- Fuck! l'm sorry. l'm just super caught
up in this shit right now, you know?

1:33:09.834 --> 1:33:11.626
- Glad you liked
Land and Freedom.

1:33:11.752 --> 1:33:13.169
- Totally. lt's like
my new favourite movie.

1:33:13.504 --> 1:33:14.671
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1:33:14.839 --> 1:33:17.674
- Hey! Skip! Sarah!
- What happened?

1:33:17.800 --> 1:33:20.802
Why aren't you guys with Leon?
- He wanted us to leave.

1:33:20.928 --> 1:33:23.680
We've been rabble-rousing,
trying to spread the word.

1:33:25.516 --> 1:33:27.017
How's the crowd coming?

1:33:27.143 --> 1:33:29.603
my thumbs hurt.

1:33:29.729 --> 1:33:31.521
l'll tell you more on the way.
Let's go.

1:33:31.689 --> 1:33:34.524
- They need your demands.
These cops are getting bored.

1:33:34.692 --> 1:33:36.818
They're gonna bust in there
and arrest you.

1:33:37.194 --> 1:33:40.488
O.Κ..
O.Κ., l'll tell the chief.

1:33:42.033 --> 1:33:43.867
O.Κ., this is what he wants.

1:33:43.993 --> 1:33:46.202
He wants the
school board commissioner

1:33:46.537 --> 1:33:48.455
to allow the kids to unionize.

1:33:48.581 --> 1:33:50.957
Αnd safe passage to Venezuela.

1:33:53.502 --> 1:33:56.171
That was a joke, the Venezuela.

1:33:56.505 --> 1:33:59.215
He wants the commissioner
brought down here.

1:33:59.550 --> 1:34:00.967
That's all.
- Fine.

1:34:01.093 --> 1:34:03.178
l want you to know
that we're humouring him.

1:34:03.512 --> 1:34:05.555
- Humouring me?

1:34:06.599 --> 1:34:08.808
Could we please just get
Αrchambault down here

1:34:08.934 --> 1:34:11.227
as quick as possible
so we can all go home?

1:34:11.562 --> 1:34:12.854
Thank you.

1:34:13.898 --> 1:34:15.565
Αwesome.

1:34:16.692 --> 1:34:18.109
- Αh-ha!

1:34:18.235 --> 1:34:19.569
- This isn't over!

1:34:19.695 --> 1:34:22.989
- Oh, l think we both know
that it pretty much is.

1:34:31.123 --> 1:34:32.207
- Mom!
What are you doing?

1:34:32.541 --> 1:34:34.125
- Get in the car, kids.
- No, Ma.

1:34:34.251 --> 1:34:38.004
We're going to the school for Leon.
Αnd no, not even just for Leon.

1:34:38.130 --> 1:34:40.590
This is something
that we all believe in.

1:34:40.716 --> 1:34:43.134
l won't come home with you!
l'm sorry if l let you down.

1:34:43.260 --> 1:34:45.637
- Stop being so shrieky!
l'll drive you.

1:34:45.763 --> 1:34:47.597
- You will?

1:34:47.765 --> 1:34:49.099
- Yeah, come on!
Come in! Hurry!

1:34:49.225 --> 1:34:52.602
- Oh, great. l don't--
Do you guys want a ride?

1:34:55.773 --> 1:34:58.108
- Can you all fit in?
Αre you O.Κ.?

1:34:58.275 --> 1:34:59.609
Put your seatbelts on.

1:34:59.777 --> 1:35:01.653
Your father wanted
to come too,

1:35:01.779 --> 1:35:03.863
but he had a meeting
with the Moroccans.

1:35:03.989 --> 1:35:05.699
- What's that?
Put the seatbelt on.

1:35:05.825 --> 1:35:07.534
- Mum! Drive the car.
- Oh, come on!

1:35:21.674 --> 1:35:22.966
- Madame, uh--

1:35:23.092 --> 1:35:24.259
- Madam Chairman...

1:35:25.720 --> 1:35:26.720
- Madame...

1:35:28.180 --> 1:35:29.806
- Ma'am l should really explain
the circumstances...

1:35:29.932 --> 1:35:32.183
- l watch the news l know exactly
what's going on here.

1:35:32.309 --> 1:35:33.643
Βut thank you very much.

1:35:33.811 --> 1:35:36.688
Leon Βronstein
Please come to the window.

1:35:37.648 --> 1:35:38.982
Give me a hand.

1:35:53.748 --> 1:35:55.165
- Uh, welcome.

1:35:58.043 --> 1:36:02.964
- l am thoroughly unimpressed
and unamused, Monsieur Βronstein.

1:36:03.090 --> 1:36:06.176
Now, perhaps this is your idea
of playful hi jinks,

1:36:06.302 --> 1:36:07.677
but in my books

1:36:07.845 --> 1:36:10.013
and in the books of
the gentlemen in uniform here,

1:36:10.181 --> 1:36:14.100
this is an egregious
and punishable offence.

1:36:14.226 --> 1:36:17.270
- Well, maybe now you'll see
that we're actually serious.

1:36:17.605 --> 1:36:21.649
- Who is the "we",
Monsieur Βronstein?

1:36:21.776 --> 1:36:24.986
You and God?
Αre you the king of Εngland?

1:36:25.112 --> 1:36:29.783
Αll l see is
one brilliant young man,

1:36:29.909 --> 1:36:32.202
desperate for attention,

1:36:32.328 --> 1:36:35.079
and clearly willing to go
all the way to get it.

1:36:35.206 --> 1:36:36.331
- O.Κ.. We want a union!

1:36:36.665 --> 1:36:39.834
- Listen, Norma Rae,
we've already had that discussion,

1:36:39.960 --> 1:36:41.920
and it's not gonna happen.

1:36:42.046 --> 1:36:44.839
So let your principal go.
- We want a union.

1:36:44.965 --> 1:36:47.675
- You don't deserve a union!
You're children.

1:36:47.802 --> 1:36:51.763
You do what we'll tell you to do.

1:36:51.889 --> 1:36:56.851
Αnd on behalf of all adults,
grow up, Monsieur Βronstein.

1:36:56.977 --> 1:36:58.019
- Madame Αrchambault!

1:36:58.145 --> 1:37:00.980
Do you want him
to be an adult or not?

1:37:01.106 --> 1:37:03.650
- Did l not just make myself clear?
- No, you didn't.

1:37:03.776 --> 1:37:06.778
lt seems like a very adult thing to do,
fighting for your rights.

1:37:06.904 --> 1:37:08.780
- Well, no one asked
for your opinion.

1:37:08.906 --> 1:37:10.657
- l agree with her.

1:37:15.746 --> 1:37:18.039
- There's a surprise.

1:37:18.165 --> 1:37:19.749
Run out of clients, Frank?

1:37:19.917 --> 1:37:22.335
Had to start scouting
the high schools?

1:37:22.670 --> 1:37:25.380
Αnd this is the best you could find?

1:37:25.714 --> 1:37:30.176
Leon Βronstein, the shining beacon
of hope for the great revolution?

1:37:30.302 --> 1:37:31.928
- l think he may well be, yeah.

1:37:33.681 --> 1:37:35.390
- How profoundly disappointing.

1:37:35.724 --> 1:37:37.433
- Good god, Denise,
you're so mean!

1:37:37.768 --> 1:37:41.312
- Why don't you tell your crazy little
friend to let us all go home? O.Κ.?

1:37:41.438 --> 1:37:43.356
- Let me ask you one
real question first.

1:37:43.691 --> 1:37:45.066
- Shoot.

1:37:45.192 --> 1:37:48.444
- What kind of people you think
it takes to change the world?

1:37:48.779 --> 1:37:49.946
l know it's all very amusing

1:37:50.072 --> 1:37:54.742
for those of us in the post-postmodern
here, this notion of revolution.

1:37:54.869 --> 1:37:57.120
Βut what kind of people
do you think it takes

1:37:57.246 --> 1:37:58.955
to really pull this thing off?

1:37:59.123 --> 1:38:00.790
Do you think
they ever change?

1:38:00.958 --> 1:38:02.959
No!

1:38:03.127 --> 1:38:04.711
They're always
the wrong men for the job.

1:38:04.837 --> 1:38:08.923
They're always the ones
other people think are crazy.

1:38:09.049 --> 1:38:10.466
- Do l really have to listen to this?

1:38:10.801 --> 1:38:13.761
- Do l think Leon Βronstein
is the right man for the job?

1:38:13.888 --> 1:38:15.388
You bet your ass, Denise,

1:38:15.723 --> 1:38:18.266
because he's doing it
and you're not.

1:38:18.392 --> 1:38:20.101
- Βravo.

1:38:20.227 --> 1:38:22.478
- Can l park here?
- Yeah, you can park here.

1:38:22.813 --> 1:38:24.981
- O.Κ..
- Uh, what's that?

1:38:25.107 --> 1:38:26.399
- What's what?

1:38:34.825 --> 1:38:37.327
- Holy fuck!

1:38:58.432 --> 1:39:00.183
- Βy the way, Denise,

1:39:00.351 --> 1:39:03.853
that shining beacon of hope
found me.

1:39:05.856 --> 1:39:09.275
Αnd l'm damn grateful he did.
- We want a union!

1:39:09.401 --> 1:39:11.486
We want a union!

1:39:11.820 --> 1:39:13.905
- We heard you, Monsieur Βronstein.

1:39:41.558 --> 1:39:45.144
- Guess this is the "we"
you were talking about, Denise.

1:39:45.270 --> 1:39:47.438
- We want a union!

1:39:47.564 --> 1:39:49.565
We want a union!

1:39:49.900 --> 1:39:51.859
- We want a union!

1:39:51.986 --> 1:39:54.237
We want a union!

1:39:54.405 --> 1:40:07.583
We want a union!

1:40:07.918 --> 1:40:10.837
We want a union!

1:40:10.963 --> 1:40:12.922
We want a union!
We want a union!

1:40:13.048 --> 1:40:21.931
We want a union!

1:41:03.182 --> 1:41:05.183
- l'm his lawyer
l go where he goes.

1:41:20.491 --> 1:41:22.533
Βoredom!

1:41:22.659 --> 1:41:24.660
Union! Union! Union!

1:41:24.995 --> 1:41:32.668
Union! Union! Union!

1:42:05.369 --> 1:42:07.495
- Well, of course
we're gonna appeal,

1:42:07.621 --> 1:42:10.456
but we're very happy
the way things turned out.

1:42:10.582 --> 1:42:13.084
- Yeah, uh, this is a message
to the youth of Canada--

1:42:13.210 --> 1:42:16.504
uh, nay, to the youth
of the world,

1:42:16.630 --> 1:42:18.673
that they may be able
to wound us,

1:42:19.007 --> 1:42:21.551
but we will never be silenced.
We will always be heard!

1:42:21.718 --> 1:42:24.220
The revolution lives on!

1:42:24.346 --> 1:42:26.055
Vive la revolution!

1:42:26.223 --> 1:42:28.558
- All charges against Leon
Bronstein have been dropped.

1:42:28.684 --> 1:42:31.060
The court released him
on one condition:

1:42:31.186 --> 1:42:32.562
he is never allowed
to attend school

1:42:32.729 --> 1:42:34.564
in the province of Quèbec,
ever again.

1:42:44.491 --> 1:42:47.577
- Well, if you need anything,
money or food, just call me.

1:42:47.744 --> 1:42:49.745
l'll send you whatever you need.

1:42:50.080 --> 1:42:53.583
- Thank you.
- O.Κ.. Αnd don't worry about Ontario.

1:42:53.750 --> 1:42:56.586
You know, they're not only
Αlice Munro and Maple Leaf fans.

1:42:56.753 --> 1:42:59.213
There are fun people there too.

1:42:59.339 --> 1:43:00.715
Αnd your father wanted to be here,

1:43:01.049 --> 1:43:03.176
but he couldn't because
he had a meeting with,

1:43:03.302 --> 1:43:04.760
you know,
those Αrabic people and--

1:43:05.095 --> 1:43:07.096
- lt's O.Κ., Mom.
- l love you.

1:43:07.264 --> 1:43:08.264
- l love you too.

1:43:08.432 --> 1:43:10.474
l'm so proud of you.
You are amazing.

1:43:10.601 --> 1:43:11.642
- Oh, stop it.

1:43:11.768 --> 1:43:14.312
Have fun.
Αnd let me know what you plot.

1:43:14.438 --> 1:43:17.732
- l will.
Αnd give my regards to Skip.

1:43:18.066 --> 1:43:20.067
- Who's Skip?
That guy l saw you with?

1:43:20.194 --> 1:43:21.569
- Thanks, Leon.

1:43:21.695 --> 1:43:22.778
- ls he Jewish?
- Ma!

1:43:23.113 --> 1:43:24.322
- Well, you know...

1:43:24.448 --> 1:43:26.532
- l know.
We're gonna honeymoon soon.

1:43:26.658 --> 1:43:28.451
l'm keeping my fingers crossed
for the Nunavut.

1:43:28.619 --> 1:43:30.119
- Hey, you're lucky.
You only have

1:43:30.287 --> 1:43:31.495
to get banished
someplace arctic once.

1:43:31.622 --> 1:43:34.415
l have to do it all over again
with my second wife.

1:43:34.541 --> 1:43:37.627
- Oh my god!
What have l done?

1:43:37.753 --> 1:43:40.046
Call me every day.
- l will.

1:43:46.595 --> 1:43:48.054
- Drive safely!

1:43:50.057 --> 1:43:51.641
- l shall return.

1:44:23.215 --> 1:44:25.800
- Hello.
- Hey.

1:44:27.177 --> 1:44:28.594
Uh...

1:44:28.720 --> 1:44:31.347
Yeah, so...

1:44:34.768 --> 1:44:36.519
l, uh...

1:44:39.856 --> 1:44:40.815
Yeah.

1:44:41.149 --> 1:44:43.276
- Chairman Mao's Little Red Βook.

1:44:43.402 --> 1:44:45.319
- Yeah, it's in Chinese.

1:44:45.445 --> 1:44:47.488
So hopefully,
you won't understand it.

1:44:50.117 --> 1:44:51.701
- Thank you, Dad.

1:45:44.880 --> 1:45:46.255
- Nadia!

1:45:48.592 --> 1:45:49.759
- Nadia!

1:45:49.926 --> 1:45:52.636
Give me a second, please.
Just one second!

1:45:53.930 --> 1:45:55.598
l didn't even sleep with her!

1:45:55.724 --> 1:45:58.642
- That's best you can do?
- Well, it's fucking early!

1:45:58.769 --> 1:46:00.436
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

1:46:00.562 --> 1:46:03.230
- Look!
Look at hotness in front you.

1:46:03.357 --> 1:46:04.440
- l know!

1:46:04.608 --> 1:46:07.443
- Αnd you cheat on me with
stupid Ontario puck bunny!

1:46:07.611 --> 1:46:08.819
- l--l didn't though.

1:46:08.945 --> 1:46:10.738
- You don't understand
my hotness?

1:46:10.864 --> 1:46:11.947
No.

1:46:12.282 --> 1:46:13.783
No, you understand nothing!

1:46:13.909 --> 1:46:16.243
Why don't you call me
when you figure out

1:46:16.370 --> 1:46:17.953
whatever fuck you want,
O.Κ., Vladimir?

1:46:18.288 --> 1:46:19.830
- Nadia.

1:46:19.956 --> 1:46:21.874
Nadia,
can you come back please?

1:46:22.209 --> 1:46:24.668
Nadia?

1:46:25.921 --> 1:46:27.963
Fuck me. Fuck!

1:46:33.470 --> 1:46:34.970
What? What's up?

1:46:35.305 --> 1:46:36.514
- Mr. Ulianov?

1:46:36.640 --> 1:46:40.643
Mr. Vladimir Ulianov?
- Only to my grandmother, pal.

1:46:41.978 --> 1:46:43.979
Fuck! ls this about
that library book?

1:46:44.314 --> 1:46:46.357
'Cause l brought it back, man.
l swear to God.

1:46:46.483 --> 1:46:48.609
Maybe they can't find it there,
but l returned it.

1:46:48.735 --> 1:46:53.781
l don't give a shit about the history
of the printing press, l swear to God.

1:46:53.907 --> 1:46:58.869
- l don't either. l don't know anyone
who does. Listen, listen, Vladimir.

1:46:58.995 --> 1:47:02.373
My name is Leon Βronstein.

1:47:06.002 --> 1:47:07.837
We have to talk.

1:47:09.631 --> 1:47:11.966
- What, now? Oh no, dude.
No, no, no.

1:47:12.300 --> 1:47:14.677
Oh, my girlfriend
just dumped me. l'm drunk.

1:47:14.845 --> 1:47:16.679
This is not a good time for me.

1:47:16.805 --> 1:47:18.973
- Listen, none of that
matters anymore.

1:47:19.307 --> 1:47:21.976
Please, allow me
to buy you a cup of coffee.

1:47:24.396 --> 1:47:26.647
Please.

1:47:28.859 --> 1:47:30.901
May l put my arm on you?

1:47:31.027 --> 1:47:36.490
You and l are going
to change the world.

1:47:36.616 --> 1:47:39.577
- Cool, uh, stop touching me.

1:47:47.878 --> 1:47:51.297
Make up your mind

1:47:51.423 --> 1:47:55.426
And don't waste your time

1:47:55.552 --> 1:48:04.643
You've been so unkind

1:48:05.896 --> 1:48:10.316
You know all of the words

1:48:10.442 --> 1:48:13.444
Feels good to

1:48:14.529 --> 1:48:19.575
Hold on

1:48:23.413 --> 1:48:27.583
Take time off
and get things done

1:48:27.751 --> 1:48:32.004
Get out
Meet new friends

1:48:32.339 --> 1:48:36.634
Tell your girl she's the one

1:48:36.760 --> 1:48:41.430
Get out get out

1:49:14.631 --> 1:49:19.385
Well, there's nothing
cool about it

1:49:19.511 --> 1:49:23.681
If there ever was I doubt it

1:49:23.807 --> 1:49:27.935
You should find pleasure
abounding

1:49:28.061 --> 1:49:32.523
From the only place I found it

1:49:32.649 --> 1:49:37.653
Take time off
and get things done

1:49:37.821 --> 1:49:41.949
Get out
Meet new friends

1:49:42.075 --> 1:49:46.412

1:49:46.538 --> 1:49:50.791
Get out get out

1:49:50.917 --> 1:49:54.503
We can see the future lately

1:49:54.629 --> 1:49:58.924
I've been lost
without you baby

1:49:59.050 --> 1:50:02.970
Even when I'm talking
to someone

1:50:03.096 --> 1:50:07.933
I am alone
I am alone

1:51:00.070 --> 1:51:03.072
Make up your mind

1:51:03.198 --> 1:51:07.660
And don't waste your time

1:51:07.786 --> 1:51:12.039
You've been so unkind

1:51:16.127 --> 1:51:42.277
Ooh

1:52:21.735 --> 1:52:25.320
Je ris pour toi
