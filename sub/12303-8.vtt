00:14.800 --> 00:15.300
Wolfe!

00:15.400 --> 00:16.500
You stay with me, Wolfe!

00:16.900 --> 00:17.600
You stay with me!

00:17.700 --> 00:18.600
We're almost there.

00:18.700 --> 00:21.400
- I got to pull it out!
- No, don't you dare pull it out, Wolfe!

00:21.500 --> 00:22.600
Get your hand off your eye!

00:22.700 --> 00:24.400
You take that nail out, you could die!

00:26.400 --> 00:29.300
This is car 529 heading east on Flagler.

00:29.700 --> 00:32.900
I need all units available for traffic assistance!

00:33.000 --> 00:33.900
Officer down.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.900
Repeat, officer down.

00:41.800 --> 00:42.900
Wolfe, you stay with me,

00:43.000 --> 00:44.400
Wolfe, all right?

00:44.900 --> 00:46.100
Stay with me, Wolfe.

00:46.200 --> 00:47.500
Come on!

00:50.600 --> 00:53.200
No, Wolfe, you're not going into shock!

00:53.300 --> 00:55.200
Come on! Stay with me!

01:00.400 --> 01:02.600
This is Eric Delko,Miami-Dade P.D.

01:03.100 --> 01:06.900
I need a trauma team available at the entrance of the E.R. immediately.

01:08.800 --> 01:10.500
Check his vitals and contain the bleeding.

01:10.600 --> 01:11.700
Get me radiology now.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.500
Sir, sir, you need to wait here.

01:13.600 --> 01:14.400
Hey, I want to go with him.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.400
I'm afraid that won't be possible.

01:15.500 --> 01:16.700
Well, tell me what you're going to do to him.

01:16.800 --> 01:18.000
Won't know until I can take X rays,

01:18.100 --> 01:20.200
- see if he's suffered brain or optical damage.
- That's fine.

01:20.300 --> 01:21.800
The minute that you know something,I want to know.

01:24.900 --> 01:25.800
What happened, Eric?

01:26.900 --> 01:28.900
I was about a block away when I heard Dispatch.

01:29.600 --> 01:31.300
I never made it to the original crime scene.

01:32.200 --> 01:32.800
Did you?

01:33.000 --> 01:33.900
Five hours ago.

02:05.400 --> 02:05.900
Frank.

02:07.400 --> 02:08.699
You calling this a homicide?

02:09.400 --> 02:10.600
It's not a pretty one, either.

02:11.000 --> 02:11.700
Brenda Hall.

02:11.800 --> 02:12.900
Shot with a nail gun.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.800
Contractor found her on the siteabout a half hour ago.

02:16.600 --> 02:19.500
- I guess the new master bedroom got christened in the worst way.
- I guess so.

02:19.600 --> 02:20.500
Is that her family?

02:21.100 --> 02:21.600
Yeah.

02:21.700 --> 02:22.800
Rounding 'em up right now.

02:22.900 --> 02:23.900
They were inside, asleep.

02:24.800 --> 02:25.800
Ten-year-old's on a sleepover.

02:25.900 --> 02:26.700
Okay...

02:28.400 --> 02:29.300
What's going on?

02:29.500 --> 02:30.700
Ma'am, hang on a second.

02:30.800 --> 02:31.700
This is a crime scene.

02:31.800 --> 02:32.500
A crime scene?

02:33.400 --> 02:35.500
What happened?! Gary!

02:35.600 --> 02:38.400
- Ma'am, ma'am, you're going to have to identify yourself.
- Charlene Hartford.

02:38.500 --> 02:39.500
I'm engaged to Gary.

02:39.600 --> 02:40.300
I live here.

02:40.400 --> 02:42.000
Did the first Mrs. Hall live here with you all?

02:42.100 --> 02:42.900
Not on your life.

02:43.800 --> 02:44.700
Can I go now?

02:44.900 --> 02:45.700
Go ahead, ma'am.

02:46.100 --> 02:46.900
Come on, honey.

02:50.300 --> 02:51.400
That's Hall's next wife?

02:52.300 --> 02:54.700
No matter how you cut it,divorce sucks.

02:55.200 --> 02:58.400
Frank... it's a killer.

03:15.240 --> 03:22.040
CSI:Miami
Season 04 Episode 08

03:22.240 --> 03:29.040
¡¶ Nailed ¡·

04:02.400 --> 04:04.100
So, the wedding's on.

04:04.300 --> 04:05.300
I know what this looks like,

04:05.400 --> 04:06.500
but you got to believe me.

04:06.800 --> 04:08.200
I didn't kill my ex-wife.

04:08.700 --> 04:09.800
And why do you think she was here?

04:10.000 --> 04:10.700
I don't know.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.300
Maybe it was topick up the china.

04:12.700 --> 04:14.400
I told her I'd leave it for her in the garage.

04:14.500 --> 04:15.800
She'd take the wallpaper if she could.

04:15.900 --> 04:16.500
Yes.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.700
So your son and fiancée were here all night long,

04:20.100 --> 04:21.500
and no one heard a sound?

04:22.300 --> 04:23.100
Not a sound.

04:23.600 --> 04:25.000
How long were you married to Brenda?

04:25.200 --> 04:26.100
18 years.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.300
Brenda was having a difficult time letting go.

04:30.300 --> 04:31.100
How do you mean, difficult?

04:31.300 --> 04:33.100
Well, she wouldn't sign the divorce papers,

04:33.300 --> 04:34.100
and you know why?

04:34.400 --> 04:36.600
Because she knew that my fiancée

04:36.700 --> 04:38.600
and I couldn't get married until she did.

04:39.000 --> 04:40.900
We had to postpone the wedding three times.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.400
When was the last time you talked to her?

04:43.000 --> 04:43.600
I haven't.

04:44.100 --> 04:45.500
Since we separated ten months ago,

04:45.600 --> 04:46.900
we only talk through our lawyers.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.700
You wouldn't describe your divorce as amicable.

04:50.100 --> 04:51.200
You ever heard of one that was?

04:52.200 --> 04:54.000
Not so far.

05:27.000 --> 05:27.700
Is that a nail gun?

05:29.000 --> 05:29.900
What are you doing here?

05:30.900 --> 05:31.700
Exactly.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.700
I thought this was your day off.

05:33.900 --> 05:34.800
Should be, after,uh,

05:34.900 --> 05:35.700
12 days straight.

05:37.400 --> 05:38.600
Eric didn't answer the call out?

05:38.900 --> 05:40.500
Yeah. That's starting to become a habit.

05:40.600 --> 05:41.000
It's not the only one,

05:41.100 --> 05:42.000
if you know what I mean.

05:43.400 --> 05:45.300
I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that.

05:46.100 --> 05:46.600
Fine.

05:46.700 --> 05:47.200
What do we got?

05:48.600 --> 05:50.400
39-year-old female.Brenda Hall.

05:50.500 --> 05:53.000
Found herself at the business end of a nail gun.

05:53.100 --> 05:54.000
Got spent nails.

05:57.400 --> 05:58.400
That's burnt grass.

05:59.600 --> 06:01.000
Wonder if it's got something to do with her death.

06:08.500 --> 06:09.600
Is it a contained burn?

06:10.200 --> 06:11.900
Yeah. I think an accelerant was used.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.700
I'll get a sample to Trace.

06:19.000 --> 06:22.400
Alexx, these wounds are from a crime of rage.

06:22.700 --> 06:25.000
Divorce does bring out the worst in people.

06:25.400 --> 06:27.800
Four nails in her neck and torso.

06:27.900 --> 06:28.900
You better believe it.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.800
Did one of the nails puncture a blood vessel?

06:32.200 --> 06:32.900
Sure did.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.100
Her axillary artery.

06:35.200 --> 06:35.700
After that,

06:35.800 --> 06:38.900
every beat of her heart drained the life out of her,literally.

06:46.800 --> 06:47.900
Baby girl bled out.

06:48.100 --> 06:49.200
Exsanguination.

06:50.100 --> 06:51.300
Are those bruises?

06:52.500 --> 06:54.100
A few of them,and they're fresh.

06:54.200 --> 06:57.000
On her wrists, back, legs.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.400
And she's got scratches on her arms.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.300
I see those.

07:00.400 --> 07:02.600
So she was fighting for her life, Alexx.

07:02.900 --> 07:04.200
Sure was, Horatio.

07:05.300 --> 07:08.100
Now let's see who she was fighting with.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.900
Horatio, you got a minute?

07:19.700 --> 07:20.200
I do.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.400
- I'll be right out,Rick.
- Okay.

07:24.100 --> 07:26.500
Alexx, get that to DNA, please?

07:31.400 --> 07:32.500
Welcome back, Horatio.

07:33.300 --> 07:34.700
It's good to be back, Rick.

07:35.000 --> 07:35.800
How's New York?

07:36.500 --> 07:37.400
New York was busy.

07:38.500 --> 07:39.400
Yeah, I heard.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.500
Uh, you had to postpone a court appearance on a "personal matter"?

07:42.600 --> 07:44.200
A case from over 20 years ago?

07:44.500 --> 07:45.300
That's true.

07:45.700 --> 07:48.000
I also hear you're a suspect in a homicide investigation.

07:48.100 --> 07:49.000
That's true, too.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.300
That's... pretty hypocritical, isn't it?

07:55.500 --> 07:56.000
Hmm.

07:56.900 --> 07:59.100
Um, not from where I'm standing, Rick.

08:02.100 --> 08:03.500
Will there be anything else?

08:03.800 --> 08:04.400
Uh, yeah.

08:04.900 --> 08:06.500
Y-You want to tell me what happened?

08:08.500 --> 08:09.800
You want to know what happened?

08:10.300 --> 08:10.800
Yeah.

08:12.400 --> 08:13.500
Okay, Rick, I'll tell you.

08:15.400 --> 08:18.100
In an attempt to save my mother's life,

08:19.200 --> 08:20.700
I intervened on a situation,

08:20.800 --> 08:22.700
and her killer wound up dead.

08:24.600 --> 08:25.400
That's what happened.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.100
And so did she?

08:28.700 --> 08:29.600
That's correct.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.900
- New York D.A.'s going after you on this?
- That's correct.

08:36.400 --> 08:37.700
Do you have any idea why?

08:39.200 --> 08:41.400
Rick, I was hoping you could tell me.

09:00.500 --> 09:01.700
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

09:02.700 --> 09:04.200
Don't sneak up on me like that.

09:04.300 --> 09:05.400
Okay, I'm sorry.

09:06.700 --> 09:08.900
So I guess you can take the girl out of firearms...

09:09.800 --> 09:10.700
but no, you can't,

09:10.900 --> 09:11.500
'cause it's you.

09:12.300 --> 09:13.000
Markham's at court.

09:13.100 --> 09:15.900
Apparently, he's perfected the magic act of disappearing.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.800
That guy gives county workers a bad name.

09:17.900 --> 09:18.600
You get anything?

09:18.800 --> 09:19.300
Try it.

09:19.900 --> 09:20.400
Really?

09:20.500 --> 09:21.800
- I can shoot this?
- Yeah.

09:22.300 --> 09:22.800
Go ahead.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.000
All right, cool.

09:26.400 --> 09:28.000
Yeah, like these things are going to stop a nail.

09:34.900 --> 09:35.900
Whoa, whoa, whoa,be careful.

09:36.700 --> 09:37.700
It-it doesn't work.

09:37.900 --> 09:38.400
I know that.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.800
That's because there's a safety in the front.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.300
You can pull the trigger all you want,

09:42.400 --> 09:44.300
but unless the safety is depressed,

09:44.500 --> 09:45.300
it won't work.

09:49.100 --> 09:52.800
So someone would have to press the gun against a person in order to shoot them.

09:52.900 --> 09:53.700
But that didn't happen,

09:53.800 --> 09:55.900
because the nails were sticking out of the victim.

09:58.000 --> 09:59.300
So the nails were airborne.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.100
Mm-hmm.

10:01.200 --> 10:02.800
They're "eight penny" nails.

10:02.900 --> 10:04.200
Two and a half inches long.

10:04.700 --> 10:07.400
So is there any way to determine whether or not that's the murder weapon?

10:07.500 --> 10:08.700
Do nails have striations?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.100
No, but they do have tool marks.

10:13.400 --> 10:15.700
Each time the piston hits the head of the nail,

10:15.800 --> 10:17.500
it leaves a unique impression.

10:25.800 --> 10:26.800
Let's see what we've got.

10:31.400 --> 10:32.600
Tool marks don't match.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.900
The imperfections are different.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.000
- Are you kidding?
- No.

10:35.100 --> 10:37.700
The nail gun found at the scene was not used to kill Brenda Hall.

10:38.200 --> 10:39.600
We got to get back to that house.

10:44.800 --> 10:45.500
Ah, there he is.

10:45.600 --> 10:46.600
Nice of you to show up.

10:47.100 --> 10:48.100
What's your problem,Wolfe?

10:48.200 --> 10:49.800
Must be nice to work on "Delko time."

10:49.900 --> 10:50.800
Cherry pick cases,

10:50.900 --> 10:51.800
show up when you want.

10:52.100 --> 10:53.900
I had something I had to take care of.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.700
- You need any help,Calleigh?
- Yo, Eric,

10:56.900 --> 10:58.000
it's too little,too late.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.500
If I thought that you could even understand what I'm going through,

11:01.600 --> 11:02.600
I'd explain it to you.

11:02.700 --> 11:03.500
Okay, you know what?

11:03.600 --> 11:04.300
That is enough.

11:04.400 --> 11:04.900
I get it.

11:05.100 --> 11:05.800
Eric, we're fine.

11:05.900 --> 11:06.700
If I need extra help,

11:06.800 --> 11:07.300
I will call you.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.700
You, in the elevator with me;

11:08.800 --> 11:09.600
we're leaving now.

11:17.500 --> 11:18.800
You always take his side.

11:19.600 --> 11:21.500
Funny-- he always says the same thing about you.

11:28.800 --> 11:29.300
Nothing.

11:30.200 --> 11:31.200
I mean, this is the construction site,

11:31.300 --> 11:32.500
there's got to be more than one nail gun.

11:32.800 --> 11:34.200
Will you check the on-site office?

11:34.400 --> 11:34.900
Okay...

11:58.600 --> 11:59.100
Any luck?

11:59.200 --> 12:00.300
No nail gun.

12:04.200 --> 12:05.500
Hey!Hey!

12:06.500 --> 12:07.000
Hey, wait.

12:07.100 --> 12:07.800
Wait, wait, wait.

12:08.100 --> 12:09.600
Miami-Dade, P.D.Hold up--

12:09.700 --> 12:10.300
Thanks.

12:17.200 --> 12:17.700
It's your turn.

12:18.100 --> 12:19.700
I dove that Dumpster at Joe's Stone Crab.

12:21.600 --> 12:22.300
I'll help you.

12:27.700 --> 12:28.300
Ugh...

12:36.600 --> 12:37.400
Oh, check it out.

12:38.500 --> 12:39.700
Looks like a bunch of burned clothes.

12:40.000 --> 12:41.700
Charred grass is starting to make sense.

12:47.500 --> 12:49.500
I think I found the accelerant.

12:50.900 --> 12:51.900
It's lighter fluid.

12:52.900 --> 12:54.500
It's probably from the family barbecue pit.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.300
They were cooking Donna Karan, size two.

12:57.900 --> 12:58.800
Daughter's too young,

12:59.000 --> 12:59.900
first wife's size 10.

13:01.100 --> 13:02.100
Leaves one female.

13:04.400 --> 13:05.500
We found these on your property,

13:05.600 --> 13:06.800
doused in lighter fluid.

13:09.900 --> 13:11.700
Yes, Brenda burned my clothes.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.100
My entire wardrobe.

13:15.900 --> 13:17.100
The char looks recent.

13:18.800 --> 13:20.000
It happened two days ago.

13:20.700 --> 13:22.700
I just got back from dropping Lucas off at school...

13:24.500 --> 13:25.700
What's the hell?

13:26.800 --> 13:28.200
Brenda, what are you doing?!

13:28.900 --> 13:30.400
I didn't put Gary through law school

13:30.500 --> 13:33.200
so he could fill your walk-in closet, you whore!

13:37.500 --> 13:38.100
That's it!

13:38.400 --> 13:39.500
I'm calling the police!

13:42.700 --> 13:44.100
Did you call the police,Charlene?

13:45.800 --> 13:46.300
No.

13:47.400 --> 13:48.400
I felt bad for her.

13:49.300 --> 13:50.700
You felt bad,or you felt guilty?

13:52.800 --> 13:55.400
You know, homicide tells us that before you were Gary's fianc?

13:55.500 --> 13:56.600
you were his secretary.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.200
I put through all of her phone calls.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.200
She berated Gary,

14:05.400 --> 14:06.900
belittled him constantly.

14:07.200 --> 14:09.600
Their relationship was over  long before I came along.

14:09.700 --> 14:12.900
All I had to do to "steal" him was be nice to him.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.800
And your confrontation never turned physical when she burned your clothes?

14:19.200 --> 14:20.800
I never touched her.

14:23.700 --> 14:24.500
Excuse me a minute.

14:30.700 --> 14:31.300
Hi.

14:32.200 --> 14:35.100
So Charlene denies ever having a physical altercation with Brenda.

14:35.400 --> 14:36.700
She may be telling the truth.

14:36.800 --> 14:39.700
Valera just tested the epithelials under Brenda's nails.

14:40.000 --> 14:41.200
She found male DNA.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.300
Male?

14:43.200 --> 14:44.200
Unknown donor.

14:44.600 --> 14:45.200
Not for long.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.100
Call Horatio.

14:51.800 --> 14:53.200
Hey, what's this?

14:53.300 --> 14:55.000
Gary, you lied to me.

14:55.200 --> 14:57.600
You saw Brenda recently,didn't you?

14:58.200 --> 14:59.500
I mean, very recently.

15:00.200 --> 15:03.000
This swab is going to verify that.

15:07.300 --> 15:07.900
Okay.

15:09.100 --> 15:09.600
Okay.

15:10.800 --> 15:11.400
I did.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.800
Our relationship was complicated.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.900
You really took the high road after you separated from Brenda, didn't you?

15:18.300 --> 15:19.200
And what's that supposed to mean?

15:19.300 --> 15:21.800
Well, you tied up every divorce attorney in town,

15:21.900 --> 15:26.600
and then cut her off financially after she raised your children for 17 years,

15:26.700 --> 15:27.600
that's what it's supposed to mean.

15:27.700 --> 15:29.400
I told her, if she wanted money,

15:29.500 --> 15:31.000
she needed to sign the papers.

15:31.100 --> 15:32.300
She refused.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.400
Now, that's why I went to her place yesterday:

15:34.600 --> 15:36.400
get her to sign once and for all.

15:36.700 --> 15:37.800
Yes, but it got physical,

15:37.900 --> 15:41.200
which would explain your skin under her fingernails,wouldn't it?

15:44.000 --> 15:44.600
Yeah...

15:45.500 --> 15:46.600
it got physical.

15:47.700 --> 15:48.800
But not like you think.

15:50.400 --> 15:51.000
Paper.

15:51.400 --> 15:51.900
Pen.

15:52.300 --> 15:53.800
All you have to do is sign,Brenda.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.600
You always said you wanted it rough.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.100
Rough enough for you?

16:15.300 --> 16:18.500
You know, they say "ex-sex" is the hottest,

16:18.600 --> 16:19.400
and what can I tell you.

16:21.800 --> 16:22.700
If she was like that before,

16:22.800 --> 16:24.100
we'd probably still be together.

16:24.300 --> 16:25.900
You are a real class act.

16:26.400 --> 16:27.600
So I'm human.

16:28.200 --> 16:31.300
Yes, it's a shame there's not a swab that can confirm that.

16:31.900 --> 16:32.700
Excuse me.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.600
Calleigh, would you go over to Brenda Hall's apartment.

16:36.700 --> 16:39.400
Gary just admitted he's been there.

16:51.300 --> 16:53.700
Looks like Brenda downsized after the separation.

16:53.800 --> 16:54.800
Injuries say violence,

16:54.900 --> 16:56.200
her husband says sex.

16:56.400 --> 16:58.200
Hopefully, we can figure out what's true.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.200
Well, it's a fine line with some people.

17:01.200 --> 17:02.300
Broken fruit bowl.

17:02.600 --> 17:03.500
Looks like there was a fight.

17:04.900 --> 17:06.300
Or it could be sex.

17:08.300 --> 17:10.099
Ever pushed aside the dinner plate to get some?

17:11.200 --> 17:14.000
Can you focus on the task at hand, please?

17:21.900 --> 17:24.099
There's no evidence of biologicals.

17:24.400 --> 17:26.599
And there was no seminal fluid found in the victim, either.

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
Nothing on the table.

17:35.500 --> 17:36.500
He could've worn a condom.

17:37.200 --> 17:38.100
Could be equivocal.

17:38.400 --> 17:39.400
It's hard to prove.

17:39.700 --> 17:40.300
I'll tell you one thing,

17:40.400 --> 17:43.300
Gary said he was coming over here to get his divorce papers signed.

17:44.200 --> 17:44.900
You see any?

17:45.200 --> 17:45.900
No, I don't.

17:46.500 --> 17:47.900
Something's definitely weird.

17:50.800 --> 17:51.900
One saved message.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.700
Sunday, November 13, 5:00 p.m.

17:54.800 --> 17:55.800
You crazy bitch!

17:55.900 --> 17:57.200
I am sick of this!

17:57.400 --> 17:58.100
We need to meet.

17:58.200 --> 17:58.900
Come over tonight,

17:59.000 --> 18:00.400
let's settle this once and for all.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.800
Gary left that message yesterday afternoon.

18:05.000 --> 18:07.300
That's seven hours after they tore this place up.

18:08.300 --> 18:09.200
Sounds like a threat.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.400
Or a promise.

18:16.900 --> 18:17.700
So, uh,

18:17.800 --> 18:18.900
wow, we went to Brenda's apartment,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.200
that's a big come down from your house in Key Biscayne.

18:21.400 --> 18:22.500
Brenda made her choices.

18:22.900 --> 18:26.700
You know, there's no evidence that says that you had sex with her.

18:28.200 --> 18:29.400
All we see is a fight.

18:30.600 --> 18:32.200
And the divorce papers,

18:32.300 --> 18:33.200
they weren't in the apartment.

18:33.300 --> 18:34.000
Where did those go?

18:34.100 --> 18:35.600
She flushed them down the toilet.

18:40.700 --> 18:41.800
Is that why you left her this?

18:45.100 --> 18:46.100
You crazy bitch!

18:46.200 --> 18:47.500
I am sick of this!

18:47.600 --> 18:48.400
We need to meet.

18:48.500 --> 18:49.100
Come over tonight,

18:49.200 --> 18:50.500
let's settle this once and for all.

18:54.000 --> 18:55.700
I said a lot of things on her machine.

18:56.700 --> 18:57.600
Heat of the moment.

18:59.400 --> 19:00.700
What time was that exactly?

19:00.900 --> 19:01.900
Yesterday at 5:00 p.m.

19:02.000 --> 19:05.200
And I've got phone records to provethat the call came from your house.

19:07.200 --> 19:07.800
No.

19:08.400 --> 19:10.600
I was with my son, Lucas,at 5:00.

19:11.300 --> 19:12.900
His baseball team made the playoffs.

19:13.600 --> 19:14.500
They played yesterday.

19:17.000 --> 19:17.800
So you were at the game.

19:17.900 --> 19:19.800
I attend all my son's games.

19:22.400 --> 19:23.300
We'll see about that.

19:50.300 --> 19:51.600
Lucas, what are you doing here?

19:54.500 --> 19:56.100
It's the last place she was alive.

20:00.600 --> 20:03.000
Lucas, I'm going to find who did this.

20:03.800 --> 20:04.900
But I need your help.

20:05.500 --> 20:06.000
Okay?

20:09.900 --> 20:10.400
Okay.

20:13.200 --> 20:16.200
I want to talk about your baseball game yesterday.

20:19.300 --> 20:20.000
What about it?

20:21.500 --> 20:22.400
Was your dad there?

20:24.300 --> 20:24.900
Yeah.

20:26.800 --> 20:27.600
What time was that?

20:30.300 --> 20:31.700
I don't know,game started at 4:00,

20:31.800 --> 20:33.300
Dad was there for my opening pitch.

20:33.500 --> 20:34.500
He stay for the whole time?

20:35.900 --> 20:38.000
No, he left early, like usual.

20:39.000 --> 20:40.100
What time did he leave?

20:42.900 --> 20:43.600
I don't know.

20:44.300 --> 20:45.100
Second inning?

20:45.200 --> 20:46.200
I looked up,he was gone.

20:47.000 --> 20:48.600
Okay, maybe 4:30?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.400
I know what you're trying to get me to say.

20:52.800 --> 20:55.100
But my dad would never do something like this to my mom--

20:55.200 --> 20:57.000
I don't care how much they hated each other.

20:58.900 --> 21:00.300
I hear you, okay?Come here.

21:00.600 --> 21:02.100
Come on, let's get you out of here.

21:11.200 --> 21:11.800
Hello, Dan.

21:12.000 --> 21:13.700
I hope you have something on the answering machine.

21:14.000 --> 21:14.900
Let's listen to the message.

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
I digitized it.

21:16.100 --> 21:17.100
You crazy bitch!

21:17.200 --> 21:18.400
I am sick of this!

21:18.500 --> 21:19.300
We need to meet.

21:19.400 --> 21:20.100
Come over tonight,

21:20.200 --> 21:21.600
let's settle this once and for all.

21:21.900 --> 21:23.500
You hear the popsin-between each sentence?

21:23.700 --> 21:24.400
What does that mean?

21:24.900 --> 21:27.100
Each time you stop and start an analog tape,

21:27.300 --> 21:28.700
it leaves a magnetic signature.

21:31.300 --> 21:32.600
You crazy bitch!

21:34.300 --> 21:36.300
When you play that back on standard equipment,

21:36.900 --> 21:39.500
that magnetic signature turns into an audible pop.

21:40.100 --> 21:41.500
There was one after each sentence.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.400
So, each sentence was taken from a separate recording.

21:44.900 --> 21:46.200
Listen to the first sentence again.

21:47.500 --> 21:48.500
You crazy bitch!

21:49.000 --> 21:49.800
Notice the hiss?

21:50.100 --> 21:52.800
Sounds like traffic noise recorded outside.

21:53.200 --> 21:54.400
You crazy bitch!

21:55.200 --> 21:56.600
And then there's the second sentence.

21:57.700 --> 21:59.000
I am sick of this!

22:00.800 --> 22:01.600
There's no hiss--

22:01.900 --> 22:03.800
- and there's some reverb on it.
- Yup.

22:04.000 --> 22:05.200
Probably recorded inside.

22:05.300 --> 22:06.700
I am sick of this!

22:07.300 --> 22:10.600
All five sentences have different ambient sounds in the background.

22:10.800 --> 22:11.600
So, separately,

22:11.700 --> 22:13.800
the sentences could be innocuous,but put together,

22:13.900 --> 22:14.900
they sound like a threat.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.000
Someone went to a lot of trouble to set this guy up.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.000
Then we should talk to the one person who doesn't have an alibi.

22:21.800 --> 22:23.000
Set up Gary?

22:23.700 --> 22:24.500
That's insane.

22:24.600 --> 22:26.100
Why would I do that?

22:26.800 --> 22:29.400
Maybe you were concerned Gary and his wife were getting back together.

22:30.600 --> 22:32.200
Them? Right.

22:34.800 --> 22:36.600
Why, is there something you're trying to tell me?

22:38.900 --> 22:40.700
My concern is who killed Brenda Hall.

22:41.500 --> 22:42.500
Well, it wasn't me.

22:43.500 --> 22:44.700
I wouldn't hurt Brenda.

22:45.700 --> 22:46.700
I was afraid of her.

22:47.000 --> 22:48.000
Gary and I both were.

22:48.700 --> 22:51.700
That woman will never be the mother of my children!

22:51.800 --> 22:53.000
Do you hear me?!

22:53.200 --> 22:56.600
- I will not be replaced!
- I can't take this anymore.

22:57.200 --> 22:58.000
Gary, do something.

22:58.100 --> 22:58.900
Just wait, wait, wait.

22:59.000 --> 23:00.100
Maybe she'll go away.

23:04.600 --> 23:06.500
Every week it was a different meltdown.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.000
She was a nightmare.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.500
But I'd put up with anything to be with Gary,

23:12.700 --> 23:14.200
to have the life that we have.

23:14.800 --> 23:16.000
Well, if you didn't set him up,

23:16.100 --> 23:17.200
someone else did.

23:17.300 --> 23:18.800
Who else had access to your home?

23:18.900 --> 23:19.600
Who doesn't?

23:20.000 --> 23:21.200
We're undergoing renovations.

23:21.300 --> 23:23.000
Half our walls are made of plastic.

23:23.500 --> 23:27.100
Would you mind if I had one of my colleagues test your phones for fingerprints?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.100
Fine. Check away.

24:18.570 --> 24:19.880
Hey,Calleigh,it's me.

24:20.690 --> 24:22.460
- Can you get to the print lab?
- (È±Ò»¾ä)

24:22.540 --> 24:23.630
I got something coming at you.

24:23.720 --> 24:25.070
- (È±Ò»¾ä)
- bye

24:49.340 --> 24:50.810
Hey,Ryan,are you still at the house?

24:50.850 --> 24:52.190
Yeah. Got a hit?

24:52.250 --> 24:56.030
Sure did.From the upstairs phone.
Belongs to Karl Lampley.

24:56.090 --> 24:57.280
- The contractor.
- Mm-hmm,

24:57.340 --> 25:00.140
and guess what.He's got a rap sheet.
Second degree murder.

25:00.450 --> 25:02.210
I'm gonna call patrol and see
if they can round him up.

25:02.260 --> 25:05.410
Okay,I'll poke around Lampley's
trailer,I'll see if we get lucky.

25:05.470 --> 25:06.830
Great.

25:13.370 --> 25:14.820
Mr. Lampley?

25:22.690 --> 25:24.590
Karl,you in here?

26:02.860 --> 26:06.670
729 Persimmon Road...
Officer needs assistance.

26:07.660 --> 26:09.640
That's Ryan.

26:29.690 --> 26:30.760
Wolfe! Wolfe,you here?

26:43.550 --> 26:45.930
Hold tight,man.
Just hold tight.

26:47.560 --> 26:50.080
We got the call.
Rescue's on the way.

26:50.310 --> 26:52.500
No,there's no time for that.
I've got to get him to the hospital now.

26:52.580 --> 26:54.840
Shooter can't be far behind.
I'll search the area.

26:55.010 --> 26:56.730
Get the door! Get the door!

27:04.350 --> 27:07.550
This car 529 heading east on Flagler.

27:07.700 --> 27:10.920
I need all units available
for traffic assistance.

27:10.960 --> 27:13.950
Officer down.Repeat,officer down!

27:23.280 --> 27:23.400
I was about a block away
when I heard Dispatch.

27:26.250 --> 27:28.280
I never made it to the original crime scene.

27:28.790 --> 27:29.970
Did you?

27:30.010 --> 27:32.460
I was there five hours ago.
I didn't see you.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.710
Yeah,well,I never got the page.

27:34.750 --> 27:37.870
Dispatch was supposed to try me three times,
they went straight to Wolfe.

27:38.540 --> 27:40.450
This is becoming a pattern,isn't it?

27:41.340 --> 27:43.340
I've got some things going on.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.380
We all do,Eric.

27:45.480 --> 27:48.090
Yeah? Okay,just hold him there.

27:48.740 --> 27:52.510
We found the contractor.
We'll talk later.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.700
Get him out of there. Right now.

28:04.600 --> 28:06.000
Let me go.
I wasn't doing anything.

28:06.050 --> 28:09.850
It's called murder and the attempted
murder of a police officer,Karl.

28:10.610 --> 28:12.140
You're kidding me.
Why would I do that?

28:12.190 --> 28:15.150
For the same reason you killed
somebody in Hialeah six years ago.

28:15.500 --> 28:16.680
Look,I did my time.

28:16.740 --> 28:18.450
Yeah,and you're gonna do some more.

28:18.830 --> 28:20.010
What's this?

28:20.300 --> 28:23.220
That's nothing,man.Just a little
under-the-table cash for a construction gig.

28:23.280 --> 28:26.690
Let's cut the crap.
Somebody hired you to kill Brenda Hall.

28:26.740 --> 28:28.850
You're attempting to cover your tracks.

28:28.930 --> 28:31.180
And now a police officer's in the hospital.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.480
Look,you're not pinning those on me.
I'm not going back to jail.

28:34.550 --> 28:37.290
Karl,if I find that weapon,
you're going back to jail.

28:38.320 --> 28:40.010
Put him in the car,please.

28:46.740 --> 28:50.840
Eric,the contractor's trailer,process it,please.

28:59.000 --> 29:00.420
Okay,Mr. Wolfe.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.850
Uh,you know,Alexx,
you don't have to...

29:03.320 --> 29:06.270
Hey,save it,tough guy.
I'm not going anywhere.

29:08.420 --> 29:10.300
You're not gonna feel anything.

29:11.200 --> 29:13.870
I know this is difficult,
but please don't move.

29:27.590 --> 29:29.490
It feels like it's still in there.

29:31.720 --> 29:33.400
That'll change.

30:08.040 --> 30:09.480
What do you got?

30:10.120 --> 30:12.210
It's gummy.Some kind of adhesive.

30:12.280 --> 30:14.320
- What do you think it is?
- I don't know.

30:14.650 --> 30:16.560
Get it to Trace and then to Firearms.

30:16.630 --> 30:19.180
We checked this place earlier.
That nail gun wasn't here.

30:33.910 --> 30:35.360
Do me a favor,Frank.

30:35.410 --> 30:39.900
Check to see if Gary Hall or his fiancée
have any open accounts at Miami Shore Savings.

30:40.200 --> 30:41.750
Okay.

30:47.450 --> 30:50.570
So you paid Karl Lampley to
kill your ex-wife,didn't you?

30:51.390 --> 30:54.890
Yesterday afternoon there was a
$5,000 withdrawal from your account.

30:55.310 --> 30:57.920
The exact amount we found on your contractor.

30:57.970 --> 31:00.820
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't been to the bank.

31:00.870 --> 31:03.300
Is your girlfriend authorized
to make withdrawals from your account?

31:03.390 --> 31:05.550
No,she's not.

31:08.580 --> 31:10.250
But my son is.

31:10.770 --> 31:12.440
I don't know what he's talking about.

31:15.470 --> 31:17.580
Does that help jog your memory?

31:17.690 --> 31:19.580
It was taken by the bank security camera.

31:20.150 --> 31:22.830
Yeah,fine,I took out the money.
So,what?

31:22.900 --> 31:24.570
Dad doesn't even notice.

31:25.630 --> 31:26.740
What'd you use it for?

31:26.780 --> 31:29.230
Stuff.
Going towards my car.

31:29.260 --> 31:32.490
Oh,that's funny,because we just found
the money on Karl Lampley.You give it to him?

31:32.570 --> 31:35.340
What,the builder guy?
Why would I do that?

31:38.960 --> 31:40.280
Lucas,listen.

31:40.890 --> 31:42.500
I need you to be honest with me,okay?

31:42.540 --> 31:45.350
This man's a suspect in your mother's murder.

31:48.840 --> 31:49.980
He is?

31:50.640 --> 31:52.550
Yeah. He is.

31:53.360 --> 31:57.060
And the more you can tell me,
the more it will help with the investigation.

31:58.710 --> 32:00.640
My mom asked me for it,all right?

32:01.750 --> 32:03.270
Your mother?

32:03.480 --> 32:05.320
Said she needed the money.

32:06.410 --> 32:09.870
Luke,you have to help me.
Your father took me off all the accounts.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.180
But what if he finds out?

32:11.210 --> 32:12.910
You know what this man has done to me.

32:12.960 --> 32:16.880
I have nothing.
He's left me with nothing.

32:17.140 --> 32:19.410
Just sign the papers,
you'll get alimony.

32:21.900 --> 32:23.710
Okay,fine,Mom,
I'll do it.

32:25.040 --> 32:26.860
Whatever you want.

32:31.400 --> 32:33.150
Thank you.

32:34.270 --> 32:35.750
She wanted 20 grand,but...

32:36.220 --> 32:38.690
...the bank would
only let me take out five.

32:41.320 --> 32:45.590
Karl,we traced the 5,000 to the Hall family.

32:45.650 --> 32:47.620
You got it from Brenda,didn't you?

32:49.610 --> 32:51.600
Brenda did give me the money as payment.

32:53.260 --> 32:54.730
To kill her ex-husband.

32:54.950 --> 32:56.070
I got your money.

32:56.660 --> 32:59.320
- Five now,the rest when it's done.
- But not here.

32:59.400 --> 33:00.990
You want to get us busted?

33:06.050 --> 33:07.630
You sure you want to do this?

33:08.280 --> 33:10.520
I want that bastard off the planet.

33:11.180 --> 33:14.240
Make Britney a widow before she's a wife.

33:18.140 --> 33:20.590
She said the back door would be unlocked,

33:20.610 --> 33:25.010
to get there at 9:00 p.m.,that everyone
would be out of the house but Gary.

33:25.390 --> 33:27.490
No one would notice me,
'cause I was always there.

33:27.550 --> 33:29.330
Then what happened?

33:29.420 --> 33:31.260
I was supposed to go to the study.

33:31.760 --> 33:33.520
She said he always worked late.

33:35.170 --> 33:37.660
I did what she said,
but he wasn't there.

33:44.880 --> 33:45.990
What are you doing here?

33:46.060 --> 33:47.890
Family night at the club.

33:47.940 --> 33:49.660
They shouldn't be home till midnight.

33:50.180 --> 33:51.550
Look,if this is some kind of setup...

33:51.600 --> 33:54.590
It isn't,but I still
want you to kill someone.

33:55.230 --> 33:56.610
Let me guess.

33:56.630 --> 33:58.150
- His fiancée?
- No.

33:59.260 --> 34:00.560
Me.

34:01.170 --> 34:03.820
You know,Karl,that is a terrific story.

34:04.210 --> 34:06.060
See,I knew you wouldn't believe me.

34:07.320 --> 34:09.139
I told her to go to hell.

34:09.460 --> 34:11.060
Hey,hey!

34:11.110 --> 34:12.949
I didn't think you would do it
if I told you the truth!

34:13.000 --> 34:14.530
- Yeah,you got that right.
- You've killed before.

34:14.570 --> 34:15.909
What,suddenly you grew a conscience?

34:15.969 --> 34:18.060
- You actually want to commit suicide?
- No.

34:18.130 --> 34:20.870
I want to be murdered,
and I want Gary to pay.

34:21.100 --> 34:22.920
- You're crazy,lady.
- Am I?

34:23.230 --> 34:25.080
I've have his DNA under my fingernails.

34:25.130 --> 34:27.150
Bruises.Scratches.

34:27.210 --> 34:28.389
Phone messages.

34:28.440 --> 34:29.800
I'm in his house.

34:29.870 --> 34:30.980
I'm in his bedroom.

34:31.040 --> 34:32.320
You and I have never met.

34:32.400 --> 34:34.010
You agreed to kill Gary!

34:34.050 --> 34:35.750
Money is money!

34:35.810 --> 34:37.900
You want someone dead,do it yourself.

34:37.940 --> 34:40.210
I got my standards.
I'm out of here.

34:42.250 --> 34:44.929
And that was the last
I saw of her until this morning.

34:45.870 --> 34:47.260
Look,I'm the one who called it in.

34:47.290 --> 34:50.190
And that's because you're
a good citizen,right,Karl?

34:51.560 --> 34:53.250
Look,say what you want,

34:53.330 --> 34:54.940
but I didn't kill her.

34:56.429 --> 34:58.280
Brenda Hall premeditated her own murder.

34:58.300 --> 34:59.490
That's correct.

34:59.530 --> 35:01.380
Karl didn't kill her,so who did?

35:01.870 --> 35:04.900
Well,we're gonna have a better idea
once we retrieve all the evidence.

35:05.180 --> 35:07.330
I thought we did.
What did I miss?

35:07.390 --> 35:08.130
Eric,

35:08.160 --> 35:13.310
visiting hours at the hospital
conclude this evening at 8:00 p.m.

35:16.090 --> 35:17.700
The nail in Wolfe's eye.

35:17.980 --> 35:19.530
That's correct.

35:29.690 --> 35:30.820
Mari?

35:32.030 --> 35:33.310
Eric.

35:37.880 --> 35:39.290
What are you doing here?

35:39.770 --> 35:41.560
Just an appointment with my doctor.

35:41.620 --> 35:43.530
Well,how come you didn't
tell me this this morning?

35:43.600 --> 35:45.090
I didn't want you to worry.

35:45.670 --> 35:46.890
Marisol...

35:47.080 --> 35:48.940
I just need to make sure.

35:51.910 --> 35:53.350
Okay.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.830
Look,let me go in with you,okay?

35:54.890 --> 35:58.570
No,no,no. You can't spend
all your time with me.I'm fine.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.620
I'm fine.

36:12.860 --> 36:14.080
Hey,Eric.

36:17.340 --> 36:18.860
She's a pretty girl.

36:19.880 --> 36:21.390
Yeah.

36:22.590 --> 36:25.960
Look,I was...I was on my way to go
see Wolfe's doctor,get that nail.

36:26.050 --> 36:27.560
I already picked it up.

36:28.020 --> 36:29.690
Beat me to it.

36:30.270 --> 36:32.110
Hey,Eric,whatever you've got
going on with that girl,

36:32.180 --> 36:34.360
you need to do it on your own time,okay?

36:35.140 --> 36:36.920
Before I lose my job?

36:37.140 --> 36:38.740
Before you lose respect.

36:53.170 --> 36:54.570
Calleigh?

36:55.400 --> 36:57.070
Hey.

36:57.480 --> 36:59.460
Is this the,uh,gun that shot Ryan?

37:00.260 --> 37:02.210
Yeah.It's also the murder weapon.

37:02.460 --> 37:04.860
You see this?
The safety's broken.

37:04.900 --> 37:07.120
It's how they were able
to fire it from a distance.

37:09.360 --> 37:10.560
Were there any prints on the gun?

37:10.620 --> 37:13.070
No,but Eric found some trace.
It should be ready about now.

37:13.100 --> 37:15.530
Oh,yeah,sorry.
Trace asked me to give that to you.

37:18.130 --> 37:19.570
Hey,Horatio,

37:20.210 --> 37:22.220
does resin narrow things?

37:23.840 --> 37:27.570
Really? Good.All right,
I'll get it to you ASAP.

37:32.640 --> 37:35.770
Lucas,we need to talk
about the night your mom died.

37:36.400 --> 37:37.930
What for?

37:38.130 --> 37:39.880
Well,for starters,

37:41.310 --> 37:43.170
you handled the murder weapon.

37:44.340 --> 37:46.380
What are you talking about?

37:52.830 --> 37:53.870
Lucas,

37:53.920 --> 37:57.400
we found a resin-based glove oil
on the handle of the nail gun.

37:57.440 --> 38:01.540
The same type of oil you used
at your baseball game yesterday.

38:04.310 --> 38:08.110
Lucas,I know you want to talk
to somebody,so talk to me.

38:11.280 --> 38:13.020
Can I trust you?

38:13.320 --> 38:15.260
You can trust me.

38:15.370 --> 38:17.230
So,tell me what happened.

38:19.880 --> 38:21.490
Well,it was after the game.

38:22.170 --> 38:23.890
I heard them talking.

38:23.990 --> 38:25.850
You heard who talking?

38:27.570 --> 38:29.260
My mom and the guy Karl.

38:29.790 --> 38:32.650
I am in his house,
I am in his bedroom.

38:32.800 --> 38:35.600
- You and I have never met.
- You agreed to kill Gary.

38:35.830 --> 38:37.300
Money is money!

38:37.310 --> 38:39.230
You want someone dead,do it yourself.

38:39.260 --> 38:41.770
I got my standards.
I'm out of here.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.160
And they were talking about
killing your dad,weren't they?

38:53.760 --> 38:55.740
I couldn't believe my ears.

39:00.100 --> 39:04.900
no,no,no.No,no.

39:08.680 --> 39:10.190
I heard.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.100
I heard everything.

39:16.790 --> 39:17.950
Lucas...

39:19.200 --> 39:21.040
what did you hear?

39:22.490 --> 39:23.970
You're trying to kill Dad?

39:25.300 --> 39:27.280
Oh,you heard us.

39:28.210 --> 39:29.990
I'm not gonna let you kill him.

39:31.510 --> 39:33.470
Then you're gonna have to kill me,Lucas.

39:34.250 --> 39:35.570
Come on,kill me,

39:35.640 --> 39:38.170
or I will kill him myself.
I will!

39:38.230 --> 39:40.580
Kill me,Lucas!
Come on,kill me!

40:02.950 --> 40:04.860
I didn't want her to hurt him.

40:06.020 --> 40:08.220
She was counting on it,son.

40:14.770 --> 40:17.110
She wanted me to?

40:25.830 --> 40:30.300
That nail gun was also
used to shoot one of my CSIs.

40:30.440 --> 40:31.280
What?

40:31.340 --> 40:32.450
I didn't do it,I swear.

40:32.550 --> 40:35.360
You know what?
I believe you.

40:38.520 --> 40:39.810
So,what happens now?

40:39.860 --> 40:43.630
I am going to talk to the person who did.

40:52.630 --> 40:55.140
I was just trying to protect Lucas.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.590
Yes,because you were
taking care of Gary's kids.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.770
It was after the police left.

41:01.980 --> 41:03.970
I-I was cleaning up.

41:15.970 --> 41:17.290
Charlene,

41:17.370 --> 41:20.170
you concealed evidence
in a murder investigation.

41:21.870 --> 41:24.040
I figured I'd put the nail
gun back in the trailer,

41:24.120 --> 41:26.790
the contractor would move
on to the next job,and...

41:28.430 --> 41:29.580
we'd all be okay.

41:29.640 --> 41:31.640
Yes,but it didn't work out
that way,did it?

41:37.050 --> 41:39.980
I thought the contractor
was coming back for something.

41:41.430 --> 41:43.210
(È±Ò»¾ä)

41:43.710 --> 41:44.910
Karl,you in here?

41:47.130 --> 41:48.740
Only,it wasn't him.

41:56.990 --> 41:58.110
Charlene,

41:58.180 --> 42:00.170
you left my officer to die.

42:03.180 --> 42:04.720
Lieutenant,I'm sorry.

42:05.720 --> 42:07.650
I truly am.

42:08.190 --> 42:10.620
And now,you're gonna have
plenty of time to prove that.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.520
Heard they were letting you out.

42:33.540 --> 42:34.990
Well,I promised I wouldn't drive.

42:35.040 --> 42:37.020
I know. That's why I

42:37.140 --> 42:38.940
came by--
give you a lift.

42:39.350 --> 42:40.870
Thanks.

42:40.950 --> 42:43.500
Look,I'm-
I'm going by your place anyway.

42:43.540 --> 42:45.530
That's cool. I'm just gonna take a cab.

42:45.630 --> 42:47.040
Listen...

42:47.070 --> 42:48.720
I know this is my fault.

42:48.980 --> 42:50.260
What is?

42:50.940 --> 42:52.190
Your eye.

42:52.240 --> 42:53.750
What are you talking about?

42:53.960 --> 42:55.000
I'm talking about,

42:55.040 --> 42:56.570
it-it was my call.

42:56.690 --> 42:58.060
Okay,no matter what's
going on in my life,

42:58.090 --> 42:59.710
I should...
I should have rolled.

42:59.730 --> 43:02.500
And take a nail in your eye?
I don't think so.

43:04.100 --> 43:05.270
Look,Eric,

43:05.320 --> 43:09.580
I went in there without any backup.
I went in there without my gun drawn.

43:10.420 --> 43:12.200
This is my fault.

43:17.860 --> 43:20.160
thank you very much for
driving me to the E.R.

43:20.910 --> 43:22.730
That was some crazy driving.

43:25.670 --> 43:27.330
It's no problem.

43:27.790 --> 43:29.350
All right.

43:33.540 --> 43:37.130
Look,you ever mention anything
about "Delko time" again,

43:37.470 --> 43:39.580
you're gonna need to
rent a room in this place.

43:39.750 --> 43:41.410
Fair enough.
