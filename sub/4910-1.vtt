16:38.080 --> 16:41.708
Honey, it makes me think of you

16:42.960 --> 16:44.752
Ohhh

16:44.837 --> 16:47.422
And there's just one thing
in particular, baby

16:48.924 --> 16:52.552
Always sticks in my mind

16:54.972 --> 16:58.266
Yes, one little song in particular, baby

16:58.934 --> 17:02.061
Always sticks in my mind

17:06.316 --> 17:09.318
And every time they play it, baby

17:09.403 --> 17:12.655
I start right in and cry

17:13.365 --> 17:16.617
Oh please don't leave me, baby

17:17.994 --> 17:19.619
(CROWD CHEERING)

17:22.458 --> 17:25.292

- Yeah.

17:43.145 --> 17:44.979
Spider, get going.

17:50.819 --> 17:51.819
Where did Spider go?

17:52.488 --> 17:54.697
- I sent him to get me some cigarettes.
- Yeah?

17:54.782 --> 17:56.491
What's wrong? Ain't you never been
in a restaurant before?

17:56.533 --> 17:58.159
- Of course!
- Coffee?

17:58.243 --> 18:00.495
That's all right. That's all right. Forget it.

18:00.579 --> 18:01.579

- Here's your silverware.

18:13.258 --> 18:14.300
Ready to order?

18:14.343 --> 18:16.177
Look here, I'm gonna have
the steak and eggs, over easy.

18:16.220 --> 18:19.347
And be sure to get
whatever you want, hear?

18:19.389 --> 18:21.140
- Miss?
- I'll have a steak.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.183
Okay.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.936
Mmm-mm-mm. Anna Mae!

18:25.521 --> 18:27.063
Girl, you shocked the hell out of me!

18:27.147 --> 18:29.190
Where a little woman like you
get such a big voice?

18:29.900 --> 18:32.318
You had them folks tore down in there!

18:32.361 --> 18:34.362
Let me put it to you this way.
It's like you sang like a man.

18:34.446 --> 18:35.446
I mean, you all woman.

18:36.073 --> 18:39.242
You all woman, any man can see that,

18:39.326 --> 18:44.372
but girl, it's like you got your own
particular way of gettin' a song out ya.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.499
It's unique.
You got your own unique sound.

18:46.542 --> 18:47.750
See, that's what sells records.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.963
Whoo, you got a flair.
Yeah, you definitely got a flair, girl.

18:52.047 --> 18:53.381
(LAUGHING)

18:57.427 --> 19:01.722
- Do you have a flair?
- A flair? Yes, I do.

19:01.807 --> 19:04.016
Matter of fact,
I got a flair for writin' songs

19:04.059 --> 19:07.854
and I also have a flair
for makin' singers famous.

19:08.355 --> 19:09.397
What do you mean?

19:09.439 --> 19:11.315
People that's come up with me,
folks that sang in my Revue,

19:11.400 --> 19:12.733
a lot of 'em went on to be big time.

19:12.818 --> 19:16.946
After they with me, they take off,
but that's all right, though.

19:17.030 --> 19:18.906
That's all right.
That's all fixin' to change.

19:19.324 --> 19:20.950

this string of pearls is shorter?

Did you cut off my pearls, girl?
This is tighter around my neck.

Maybe it's all them chitlins you ate.

20:13.086 --> 20:15.713

Anna Mae Bullock's mother,
Mrs. Bullock, does she live here?

20:48.956 --> 20:49.997
I'm her mother.

This is Anna Mae's mother!
Y'all believe that?

20:53.877 --> 20:55.836
- I can't believe that.
- No.

We play down
at the Club Royal every...

21:09.559 --> 21:12.812
Listen, Mrs. Bullock.
Anna Mae sang at the club last night.

21:12.854 --> 21:16.023
- She knocked everybody out.
- No joking.

21:16.066 --> 21:17.692
Mr. Turner say I got a flair, Mama.

21:18.360 --> 21:22.697
- The kind would sell records.
- Mama, Anna Mae can sing.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.865
I didn't pay for Anna Mae to come

21:24.908 --> 21:26.867
all the way up here
from Nutbush, Tennessee

21:26.910 --> 21:28.953
to be wastin' time
with a bunch of musicians.

Well, wait a minute, Mama,
it wasn't like that. Anna Mae...

Mr. Turner, I don't know
what you had in mind,

21:46.805 --> 21:49.598
but this little girl's gonna be a nurse

21:51.226 --> 21:53.811
and bring a steady paycheck
in this house.

21:53.895 --> 21:56.397
Yes, ma'am, but Miss Bullock,

21:57.399 --> 22:00.693
did you ever see a nurse
drivin' an automobile as fine as mine?

22:05.365 --> 22:07.283
Meaning... May I?

22:10.996 --> 22:12.747
Now, look here,

22:13.165 --> 22:14.290
if you let Anna Mae work with me,

22:14.374 --> 22:16.417
I guarantee you she'll be makin'
big money in no time.

to sing in my band, but I want her.

your flowers accidentally outside.

- Sing.

screamin' like a maniac.

to the dentist before, have you?

I'm gonna have Fross carry you
to the dentist in the morning.

Well, you talkin' about the baby and the

Ike wants a big house with a pool

50:06.628 --> 50:10.047
and I know he's always wanted
his own recording studio.

50:10.090 --> 50:14.343
Now, don't forget about those

Mmm.

50:33.280 --> 50:35.364
Every time I turn my back, Ma.

50:36.783 --> 50:40.661
Child, he's just bein' a man.
Don't be worryin' about him.

50:40.746 --> 50:44.957
Don't be naggin' him now.
Look here, you got yourself a good man.

You just keep him happy.

Well, I hear you're playin' daddy, huh?
You're playin' the family man!

51:28.835 --> 51:30.628

51:39.846 --> 51:40.888
I'm not messin' with you.

51:40.972 --> 51:42.264
What am I gonna do

51:42.682 --> 51:45.101
What am I gonna do with two
more kids, woman! Come back here!

51:45.185 --> 51:46.185
Leave me alone, Ike!

51:46.269 --> 51:48.562
You always wanna come around here
and start some mess!

51:49.898 --> 51:51.107
You better get your ass away
from around here...

51:51.191 --> 51:52.191
Don't fuck with me, Ike!

51:52.234 --> 51:54.026
You better not never bring
your ass around here again!

51:54.111 --> 51:55.319
I said, don't fuck with me, Ike.

51:55.362 --> 51:57.154
Come on, you guys take those on out.

51:59.032 --> 52:00.950
What the hell am I gonna do

52:01.535 --> 52:03.452
What am I gonna do

52:06.331 --> 52:07.581
I saw you.

52:08.250 --> 52:09.959
It's all right, it's okay.

52:10.043 --> 52:13.379

52:13.463 --> 52:17.049

52:17.092 --> 52:19.635
No? It's gonna be an adventure, huh?

52:19.719 --> 52:21.053
I saw you.

52:21.096 --> 52:24.098
You wanna go inside
and see what toys I packed up?

52:24.182 --> 52:26.976
Yeah? All right. Come on.

52:27.060 --> 52:28.310
I wanna see.

52:33.859 --> 52:35.734
DEEJAY: It's the cool sound of KAJT

52:35.777 --> 52:38.946
and here comes the hot sound
of the British Invasion.

52:39.030 --> 52:41.157

52:41.241 --> 52:44.076
Do wah diddy diddy

52:44.578 --> 52:47.454
Snappin' her fingers

Singin' do wah diddy diddy
Dum diddy do

52:51.585 --> 52:53.419

52:53.461 --> 52:55.379
- She looked fine
- Looked fine

52:55.422 --> 52:59.633
She looked good, she looked fine
and I nearly lost my mind

52:59.718 --> 53:03.179
Before I knew it
she was walkin' next to me

53:03.263 --> 53:06.807

MAN: So what's your take on the new
English music invading the States?

53:21.531 --> 53:24.700
Well, actually there ain't
nothin' new about it.

53:24.784 --> 53:26.243
It ain't nothin' but black music.

53:26.286 --> 53:29.330
I mean, Negro music with an accent.

53:29.414 --> 53:31.624
But, personally, I like a lot of it.

53:33.043 --> 53:36.962
Ike, I sense you don't feel
fully appreciated here?

53:37.005 --> 53:39.632
Well, we have been doin'
a lot of touring all over the country

53:39.674 --> 53:42.635
and Ike's been writin' a lot of
great new songs.

53:47.140 --> 53:48.182
Ike?

53:55.649 --> 53:56.982

As much as we work?

to get Ike out of my system...

01:41:14.485 --> 01:41:17.737
And now that I've done that, I'm ready.

01:41:17.946 --> 01:41:19.864
I'm ready, and I know what I want.

01:41:20.616 --> 01:41:23.034
Tina, cheers.

01:41:25.746 --> 01:41:27.288
To you.

01:41:29.625 --> 01:41:31.793
- To us.
- To us.

01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:37.006
- I'll see you tomorrow, noon.
- Noon?

01:41:37.049 --> 01:41:39.175
- Yes. No, you need to come in early.
- You said 1:00.

01:41:39.218 --> 01:41:43.179
Hey, Tina, between you and Roger,
how do you expect us to get any rest?

01:41:43.222 --> 01:41:45.014
I'll just stay up till then.

01:41:45.057 --> 01:41:47.016
Good night, fellas.

01:41:50.562 --> 01:41:52.522

01:41:52.564 --> 01:41:54.148
Hey, look, I...

01:41:54.191 --> 01:41:56.109
Give me a few minutes of your time.

01:41:56.193 --> 01:41:57.318
No. I don't think so, Ike.

01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.862
Come on, Ann. Now hold on.
Look, I brung you something.

01:41:59.905 --> 01:42:02.698
I brung a gift for ya. Hold on.

01:42:02.991 --> 01:42:05.701
Oh, yeah, you gonna like this.

01:42:07.037 --> 01:42:09.705

01:42:12.501 --> 01:42:15.586

01:42:15.671 --> 01:42:18.798
Look, I just need to talk to you

01:42:19.633 --> 01:42:20.842
All right?

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:24.929
I'm not gonna make it.
I need to talk to somebody. Please.

01:42:28.517 --> 01:42:33.229
All right. Two minutes.

01:42:39.862 --> 01:42:41.571
- There you go.
- Uh-uh.

01:42:42.322 --> 01:42:45.741
Okay. Okay, two minutes. Two minutes.

01:42:50.038 --> 01:42:53.124
Goddamn, girl. You look good!

01:42:53.208 --> 01:42:55.585
- Thanks.
- Mmm-mmm-mmm. (SNIFFING)

01:42:56.253 --> 01:42:58.212
What is that you got on?
You smell good.

01:42:58.255 --> 01:43:00.256
- Look, Ike...
- All right, all right, all right.

01:43:00.299 --> 01:43:01.716
What is this about, huh?

01:43:02.634 --> 01:43:05.052
Well, the record company
tryin' to put me in jail.

01:43:05.095 --> 01:43:08.139
Talkin' about I owe them all kind
of money, and I got to do somethin'.

01:43:08.765 --> 01:43:12.101
Well, you do, Ike. I mean,
you took a lot of advance money,

01:43:12.186 --> 01:43:13.728
and you didn't make good on it.

01:43:13.770 --> 01:43:16.230
Yeah, well, look here,
I know all that, but...

01:43:16.273 --> 01:43:18.733
See, if I could just get me another
hit record, now I'd be all right.

01:43:18.775 --> 01:43:19.984
They'd get off my back
and give me some slack.

01:43:20.068 --> 01:43:21.068
You know what I'm talkin' about?

01:43:21.111 --> 01:43:24.906
Look, I've been writing some songs.
Yeah, I have.

01:43:24.948 --> 01:43:28.951
And I wrote this one song. It's called...

01:43:29.953 --> 01:43:33.080
Goddamn, I forgot the name of it.
Anyway, look here, I wrote it for you.

01:43:33.123 --> 01:43:36.000
And it's got...
I mean, it's a beautiful love song.

01:43:36.084 --> 01:43:38.628
It's got that real nice slow groove
everybody listen to now.

01:43:39.087 --> 01:43:43.299
And every time I hear it,
it remind me of us.

01:43:43.884 --> 01:43:47.011
I got my own band now, you know.
I got my own songs.

01:43:47.095 --> 01:43:49.722
But a lot of that stuff you do in there,
there ain't nobody gonna buy that.

01:43:49.806 --> 01:43:52.350
I mean, maybe somebody gonna buy it,
but it ain't like you and me.

01:43:52.434 --> 01:43:55.394
I mean, when we was together,
our thing was... Like this here.

01:43:57.189 --> 01:43:58.814
Look, I really got to go.

01:43:59.399 --> 01:44:03.194
Just hold on a second, will ya?
I got one more thing I wanna say to you.

01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:05.238
Look, I been doin' a lot of thinkin' and...

01:44:05.322 --> 01:44:06.322
Two minutes.

01:44:06.365 --> 01:44:08.866
All right, now! Look...
Goddamn it, I miss you, Ann.

01:44:08.951 --> 01:44:10.743
I'm tired of this.
This done gone on long enough,

01:44:10.827 --> 01:44:11.994
and I want you to come home now.

01:44:14.498 --> 01:44:16.832
I know everything between us wasn't...

01:44:16.875 --> 01:44:18.417
Look, everybody got problems, Ann.

01:44:18.502 --> 01:44:20.795
I'm tryin' to take care of mine.
I gave up that narcotic.

01:44:20.837 --> 01:44:24.298
I'm just... Look, I'm tellin' you
right here and right now,

01:44:24.341 --> 01:44:26.884
I'm gonna try
and do right by you this time.

01:44:28.178 --> 01:44:30.179
- Bye, Ike.
- Bye? Wait a minute!

01:44:30.222 --> 01:44:33.349
I ain't through talkin' to you yet now.
You think about this: I made you.

01:44:34.685 --> 01:44:35.685
You wasn't nothin' without me,

01:44:35.727 --> 01:44:36.727
and you ain't gonna be nothin'
without me.

01:44:37.437 --> 01:44:40.189
I was wonderin' when old Ike Turner
was gonna show up.

01:44:40.732 --> 01:44:43.276
You get on. Do your la-di-da thing.
Go ahead.

01:44:43.694 --> 01:44:45.111
Yeah, all right. Lay it on.

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:47.530
You ain't Donna Summer.
I'm gonna see you again, Ann.

01:44:49.866 --> 01:44:51.909
Goddamn it.
You done broke my window.

01:44:53.870 --> 01:44:56.580
Look what you done did now.
You messed up a nice automobile.

01:44:56.665 --> 01:44:58.582
That's all right.
I'm gonna take care of that.

01:44:58.667 --> 01:45:00.543
This shit ain't over, Anna Mae.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.087
You can believe this shit ain't over.

01:45:03.880 --> 01:45:07.717
I'm a soul survivor

01:45:11.555 --> 01:45:13.514
Soul survivor

01:45:13.557 --> 01:45:15.057
DAVIES: Okay, well, it's very exciting.

01:45:15.100 --> 01:45:17.351
We've booked the Ritz
in New York City.

01:45:17.394 --> 01:45:19.895
One of the reasons for doing
this showcase at the Ritz

01:45:19.980 --> 01:45:21.814
is that a lot of these people,

01:45:21.898 --> 01:45:23.566
a lot of these doubters
can come along and see

01:45:23.650 --> 01:45:25.985
how exciting this new stuff
really is and how,

01:45:26.069 --> 01:45:27.820
how focused she really is
at the moment.

01:45:28.572 --> 01:45:31.824
In Buddhism, we do a chant
called "Nam myoho renge kyo"

01:45:31.908 --> 01:45:35.244
and what that signifies
is that everything in our life

01:45:35.287 --> 01:45:37.079
is cause and effect.

01:45:37.164 --> 01:45:40.416
If there's anything within you
that needs to be changed, you do it.

01:45:40.584 --> 01:45:41.584
You change it.

01:45:41.835 --> 01:45:44.920
MAN ON TV: Can Tina Turner
really make a comeback at age 44?

01:45:45.005 --> 01:45:47.673

01:45:47.758 --> 01:45:49.050

01:45:51.595 --> 01:45:53.054
Hey.

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:56.682
What happened?
Who did this to you, Junior?

01:45:56.850 --> 01:45:59.935
Father. He freaked out.
He kicked me out of the house.

01:46:00.312 --> 01:46:02.563
Jackie. Come on in here.

01:46:02.606 --> 01:46:04.106
Get me something
to clean him up with, please.

01:46:04.191 --> 01:46:05.816
- Yeah, yeah.
- What happened?

01:46:05.901 --> 01:46:08.611
Turn that off, please. Come on. Ronnie.

01:46:08.862 --> 01:46:12.448
Listen. I don't want you
goin' back over there, all right?

01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.116
I want you to stay with me.

01:46:14.284 --> 01:46:15.368
Ma, there's something
you should know.

01:46:15.452 --> 01:46:16.869
I mean, he's been sayin' crazy stuff.

01:46:17.120 --> 01:46:20.289
I mean, anybody mention you or
the show at the Ritz, he just go nuts.

01:46:20.374 --> 01:46:22.792
He go nuts. He said you ain't
gonna walk out on that stage.

01:46:23.293 --> 01:46:25.961
- That man has got a hit out on you.
- Thank you, Jackie.

01:46:27.798 --> 01:46:31.550
Listen, Junior. Don't you
think about that. You hear me?

01:46:33.970 --> 01:46:36.305
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.

01:46:36.390 --> 01:46:38.766
Mama, he wants to hurt you.

01:46:39.017 --> 01:46:41.268
He's gonna hurt you.
I don't know what he's gonna do.

01:46:41.853 --> 01:46:43.562
Come here.

01:46:44.272 --> 01:46:47.316
I'm sorry. I know it hurts.

- MAN: Five minutes, Miss Turner.
- Okay, thank you.

01:47:14.970 --> 01:47:17.972
All right, now, listen. I'm going
out the front. See you after the show.

01:47:18.014 --> 01:47:20.474
- Okay. All right.
- All right. All right.

01:47:21.685 --> 01:47:22.685
Roger?

01:47:25.605 --> 01:47:26.605
Thanks.

01:47:27.023 --> 01:47:28.524
Good luck, huh?

01:47:31.361 --> 01:47:32.611
(SIGHS)

01:47:35.031 --> 01:47:36.323
Okay.

01:47:43.665 --> 01:47:44.874
(KNOCKING)

01:47:44.916 --> 01:47:47.209
Yeah, come in.

01:47:49.045 --> 01:47:50.504
Damn, who died?

01:47:50.547 --> 01:47:53.215
You got enough flowers
in here for a funeral, eh?

01:47:54.676 --> 01:47:58.095
How'd you get in here, Ike?
What do you want, huh?

01:47:58.180 --> 01:48:00.014
Hey, it's a big night for little Anna Mae.

01:48:00.056 --> 01:48:01.265
I come to see the show
just like everybody else.

01:48:01.349 --> 01:48:02.850
How'd you get past security?

01:48:02.893 --> 01:48:05.561
Oh, come on, now.
You know me better than that.

01:48:06.146 --> 01:48:08.898
Now look here, I told you.
I told you it wasn't over.

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:12.735
I told you you was gonna see me again.
Here I am, big and bold as shit.

01:48:13.695 --> 01:48:15.863
You didn't even believe me. Thought
you was gonna get away from me.

01:48:15.906 --> 01:48:18.407
Thought a nigger like me
was gonna let you get away from me?

01:48:18.450 --> 01:48:20.743
You can't get away from me, Ann.
I'm in here.

01:48:21.077 --> 01:48:22.703
Now you gonna act like
you don't even know me.

01:48:22.787 --> 01:48:23.871
Yeah, I know you, Ike.

01:48:23.914 --> 01:48:27.583
- I know you real well, all right?
- All right, Ann.

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:32.171
You know me so well,
tell me what I'm gonna do now.

01:48:35.509 --> 01:48:36.634
Hmm?

01:48:39.846 --> 01:48:41.514
Come on. I can't hear you.

01:48:43.517 --> 01:48:47.102
You ain't got all that mouth now.
Come on. Tell.

01:48:47.521 --> 01:48:51.357
- Talk to me, Ann. I can't hear you.
- That supposed to scare me?

01:48:53.443 --> 01:48:55.277
Oh, yeah.

01:48:57.113 --> 01:49:00.157
What you gonna do? I don't know.

01:49:00.242 --> 01:49:02.284
Do what you wanna do, Ike. I don't care.

01:49:04.120 --> 01:49:06.247
Let me tell you what I'm gonna do.

01:49:06.289 --> 01:49:08.374
I got a roomful of people
who've come to see me.

01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:11.293
You hear me, Ike? Come to see me.

01:49:13.672 --> 01:49:15.214
So what do you wanna do? I don't know.

01:49:15.298 --> 01:49:16.549
Shoot me?

01:49:18.176 --> 01:49:20.302
Pistol-whip me?

01:49:29.980 --> 01:49:31.188
Mm-hmm.

01:50:13.106 --> 01:50:14.940
(APPLAUSE, CHEERING)

01:50:24.868 --> 01:50:26.785
You must understand

01:50:26.870 --> 01:50:28.996
Though the touch
of your hand

01:50:29.039 --> 01:50:31.373
Makes my pulse react

01:50:33.877 --> 01:50:36.670
That it's only the thrill

01:50:36.713 --> 01:50:41.175
Of boy meeting girl
Opposites attract

01:50:41.217 --> 01:50:42.801
It's physical

01:50:45.722 --> 01:50:48.974
Only logical

01:50:50.518 --> 01:50:53.020
You must try to ignore

01:50:53.229 --> 01:50:55.439
That it means more than that

01:50:55.690 --> 01:51:00.903
Oh, oh what's love
got to do, got to do with it?

01:51:01.613 --> 01:51:06.075
What's love
but a secondhand emotion?

01:51:06.493 --> 01:51:10.537
What's love got to do
got to do with it?

01:51:10.747 --> 01:51:15.417
Who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken?

01:51:15.543 --> 01:51:19.713
It may seem to you
that I'm acting confused

01:51:19.756 --> 01:51:21.632
When you're close to me

01:51:24.928 --> 01:51:29.139
If I tend to look dazed
I read it someplace

01:51:29.265 --> 01:51:31.475
I've got cause to be

01:51:31.768 --> 01:51:34.687
There's a name for it

01:51:36.523 --> 01:51:39.608
There's a phrase that fits

01:51:41.319 --> 01:51:45.989
But whatever the reason
you do it for me

01:51:46.074 --> 01:51:51.495
Oh, oh what's love
got to do, got to do with it?

01:51:52.163 --> 01:51:56.291
What's love
but a secondhand emotion?

01:51:57.085 --> 01:52:00.546
What's love got to do
got to do with it?

01:52:25.447 --> 01:52:30.576
I've been taking on
a new direction

01:52:30.660 --> 01:52:33.454
And I have to say

01:52:35.457 --> 01:52:39.668
I've been thinkin'
about my own protection

01:52:39.753 --> 01:52:44.047
It scares me to feel this way

01:52:44.507 --> 01:52:47.050
Oh, oh, what's love

01:52:47.135 --> 01:52:50.387
Got to do
I said got to do with it?

01:52:50.555 --> 01:52:55.476
What's love
but a secondhand emotion?

01:52:55.685 --> 01:52:59.688
What's love got to do
got to do with it?

01:53:00.440 --> 01:53:05.486
Who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken?

01:53:05.528 --> 01:53:08.781
- What's love
- Got to do got to do with it?

01:53:08.865 --> 01:53:11.325
- What's love
- What's love

01:53:11.409 --> 01:53:14.077
But a secondhand emotion?

01:53:14.496 --> 01:53:16.413
What's love

01:53:16.498 --> 01:53:18.749
Got to do
I say got to do with it?

01:53:19.459 --> 01:53:24.880
Who needs a heart
when a heart can be broken?

01:53:29.928 --> 01:53:31.762
(CHEERING, APPLAUSE)

01:53:38.520 --> 01:53:41.355
(I DON'T WANNA FIGHT PLAYING)

01:53:41.439 --> 01:53:44.191
There's a pale moon in the sky

01:53:44.692 --> 01:53:48.529
The kind you make your wishes on

01:53:50.573 --> 01:53:54.660
Whoa, like the light in your eyes

01:53:54.828 --> 01:53:58.330
The one I build my dreams upon

01:54:01.251 --> 01:54:03.585
It's not there any longer

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:09.216
Something happened somewhere
and we both know why

01:54:11.761 --> 01:54:14.012
Hmm, but me I'm gettin' stronger

01:54:14.764 --> 01:54:19.601
We must stop pretending
I can't live this lie

01:54:23.147 --> 01:54:29.778
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:54:30.280 --> 01:54:33.156
Too much talkin', babe

01:54:33.658 --> 01:54:40.205
Let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:54:40.456 --> 01:54:44.126
This is time for letting go

01:54:51.676 --> 01:54:54.970
I hear a whisper in the air

01:54:55.221 --> 01:54:58.974
That simply doesn't bother me

01:55:01.102 --> 01:55:05.314
Boy, can't you see that I don't care

01:55:05.648 --> 01:55:09.109
Or are you looking right through me

01:55:11.946 --> 01:55:14.823
- It seems to me that lately
- Seems to me that lately

01:55:14.908 --> 01:55:19.995
You look at me the wrong way
and I start to cry

01:55:22.665 --> 01:55:25.167
- Could it be that maybe
- Could it be that maybe

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:30.589
This crazy situation is the reason why

01:55:31.466 --> 01:55:33.091
Oh

01:55:33.801 --> 01:55:40.349
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:55:40.975 --> 01:55:43.769
Too much talkin', babe

01:55:44.270 --> 01:55:50.233
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:55:50.902 --> 01:55:54.613
This is time for letting go

01:55:59.869 --> 01:56:04.206
Hanging on to the past

01:56:05.041 --> 01:56:08.460
It only stands in our way

01:56:09.921 --> 01:56:14.883
We have to grow for our love to last

01:56:16.552 --> 01:56:20.889
But we just grew apart

01:56:22.475 --> 01:56:27.020
Oh, don't wanna hurt no more

01:56:41.828 --> 01:56:47.958
But, baby, don't you know
No, I don't wanna hurt no more

01:56:48.918 --> 01:56:51.962
Too much talkin', babe

01:56:52.255 --> 01:56:57.843
Don't care now who's to blame
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:56:59.387 --> 01:57:02.889
Tired of all these games

01:57:02.932 --> 01:57:08.812
I don't care who's wrong or right
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:57:09.522 --> 01:57:12.566
This time I'm walkin', babe

01:57:12.817 --> 01:57:19.614
So let's sleep on it tonight
I don't really wanna fight no more

01:57:19.657 --> 01:57:22.784
This is time for letting go
