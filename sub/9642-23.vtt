WEBVTT

00:00.375 --> 00:02.375
Come on, Harper!

00:02.375 --> 00:05.166
What says, "I'm ready
for a night out on the town,"

00:05.166 --> 00:08.583
the baby bird earrings
or the pigeon wing hat?

00:09.625 --> 00:11.208
The baby bird earrings.

00:11.208 --> 00:12.833
They say, "Two cute chicks."

00:12.833 --> 00:15.583
The hat just says,
"Don't talk to us."

00:15.583 --> 00:18.208
Oh, we are gonna
dance the night away!

00:18.208 --> 00:20.625
You know why? Because
we don't have a curfew.

00:20.625 --> 00:22.375
We don't have rules.

00:22.375 --> 00:25.416
We don't have
paper towels!

00:25.416 --> 00:27.625
Oh, remind me to pick some
of those up on the way home.

00:27.625 --> 00:30.458
Whoo! Party! Yeah!

00:34.375 --> 00:38.458
Hey... look at
the two cute chicks.

00:38.458 --> 00:40.208
Oh, thank you very much.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.333
I was talking
about her earrings.

00:44.625 --> 00:46.000
Well, you were right.

00:46.000 --> 00:47.250
Lobby, please.

00:51.208 --> 00:53.708
Oh, and before I forget,
here's our rent money, Dexter.

00:53.708 --> 00:56.416
It was a pleasure
doing business with you.

00:56.416 --> 00:59.250
Oh, how about
the electric bill?

00:59.250 --> 01:01.000
Oh, I got this, Harper.

01:01.000 --> 01:04.000
Uh... OK, well,
here you go.

01:04.000 --> 01:07.458
Oh, and while we're at it,
you guys still haven't paid
your cable bill.

01:07.458 --> 01:10.000
Oh... here you go.

01:10.000 --> 01:11.958
And the water bill?

01:14.125 --> 01:17.166
Will you take
a dollar eighty-five...

01:17.166 --> 01:19.500
- ...and some
cute chick earrings?
- Hey!

01:25.416 --> 01:28.125
Lobby.
Here we are, ladies.

01:28.125 --> 01:29.458
Dance the night away.

01:29.458 --> 01:32.125
You gonna do the Dougie?
Lean and brush! Lean and brush!

01:32.125 --> 01:33.708
Please stop that.

01:34.958 --> 01:36.958
We don't have
any money left.

01:37.750 --> 01:39.375
Just take us back up.

01:39.375 --> 01:41.583
Well, I had a good time.
How about you?

01:46.625 --> 01:48.500
What's the point
of having our own apartment

01:48.500 --> 01:50.416
if we can't afford
to have fun?

01:50.416 --> 01:52.000
You know, a lot of people
on this floor

01:52.000 --> 01:54.708
have roommates to
help them pay the rent.

01:54.708 --> 01:56.000
Well, you heard him, Harper.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.458
You're out.
I need a richer roommate.

01:57.458 --> 02:00.166
He means another roommate.

02:00.166 --> 02:02.458
Oh. Well, hey, Harper,
you're back in.

02:02.458 --> 02:04.583
Find us another roommate.

02:07.875 --> 02:13.833

what it seems ♪

02:13.833 --> 02:16.000

02:57.625 --> 03:01.458
OK, I've written down
some questions to ask
our prospective roommates.

03:01.458 --> 03:05.208
Oh, me too.
"Do you have any money?"
and "Are you my size?"

03:05.208 --> 03:07.333
Might as well get someone
we can share clothes with.

03:07.333 --> 03:10.208
Oh, how exciting!

03:10.208 --> 03:11.708
The first applicant
is here.

03:14.416 --> 03:18.000
Will this be the person
we share our lives with?
I just don't know.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.375
Hello, I'm here
about the roommate ad?

03:22.166 --> 03:25.333
- Come on, Mason.
- No, really.
Think about it.

03:25.333 --> 03:29.416
Two girls living with a brave
werewolf to protect them.

03:32.166 --> 03:34.375
What was that?!

03:34.375 --> 03:37.250
That was our fireplace dragon,
you big brave werewolf.

03:37.250 --> 03:39.875
Thank you for your application.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.416
We'll take it
under consideration.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.583
Yes! She's taking it
under consideration.

03:44.583 --> 03:46.458
I am wearing her down.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.416
I think that was just a polite
way to get rid of you.

03:48.416 --> 03:50.000
Only time will tell.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.125
I was kind of
getting rid of you.

03:52.125 --> 03:54.583
Well, that didn't take
very much time.

03:56.833 --> 03:57.875
Mason, wait.

03:59.875 --> 04:03.875
I'm really glad that we're
still friends, but I just think
it's time for you to move on.

04:03.875 --> 04:05.458
Move on?

04:07.333 --> 04:10.375
Very well. I heard this
apartment had fleas anyway.

04:15.375 --> 04:16.958
That boy really
wants you back.

04:16.958 --> 04:19.958
No, I know. This is the ugly
side of being irresistible.

04:23.583 --> 04:25.583
Hello? I'm here
about the apartment.

04:25.583 --> 04:26.958
Aah! A ghost!

04:29.458 --> 04:32.833
You guys have pillow fights?
I love it here already!

04:36.875 --> 04:40.291
Hi, I'm Lucy. I hear you're
looking for a roommate.

04:40.291 --> 04:42.000
Well, we sure are.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.583
You're cute and about my size.
Do you have any money?

04:44.583 --> 04:47.958
Now, hold on, Alex.
Don't you think we should
get to know her first?

04:47.958 --> 04:50.166
What? A ghost roommate
is perfect.

04:50.166 --> 04:52.833
We don't have to yell
at her if she stands
in front of the TV.

04:52.833 --> 04:55.250
Making sure someone
is see-through

04:55.250 --> 04:56.750
is not how I pick
a good roommate.

04:56.750 --> 04:58.958
I can pay the first
two months' rent right now.

04:58.958 --> 05:00.875
That's how I pick
a good roommate.

05:09.833 --> 05:12.083
OK, here's your water.
And I'll grab your pickles.

05:12.083 --> 05:13.875
One second, I'll be
right with you.

05:13.875 --> 05:16.833
Here's your sandwich.
Please don't want anything else.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.500
Justin. Look, I know
I said I'd help you out

05:22.500 --> 05:24.416
so you can study
for the wizard competition,

05:24.416 --> 05:26.583
but you didn't say I'd
be doing this by myself.

05:26.583 --> 05:28.875
OK, well, I'm sorry.
My parents should be back soon.

05:28.875 --> 05:31.125
They're just dropping
Max off at wizard camp.

05:31.125 --> 05:33.000
But in the meantime,
I ordered you a robot.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.375
Yes! My robot bride
is on the way!

05:38.083 --> 05:40.000
It's a helper,
not a bride.

05:40.000 --> 05:41.833
It still is a "her,"
though, right?

05:41.833 --> 05:43.583
I don't want to have to
talk about sports with it.

05:45.416 --> 05:47.833
It doesn't matter, because
I called the delivery people

05:47.833 --> 05:49.750
and they said that
it's lost in transit.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.708
Sorry.

05:54.250 --> 05:56.875
Robot delivery
for Justin Russo.

05:56.875 --> 06:01.750
I mean, "I don't know what's
in this box" delivery
for Justin Russo.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.958
She's here! She's here!

06:07.958 --> 06:11.000
That's so weird,
'cause they said it was lost.

06:11.000 --> 06:13.708
Who cares? Let's crack this
baby open and get it working.

06:18.208 --> 06:19.583
Bummer. It came assembled.

06:30.875 --> 06:33.875
Hello. My name is, Robuddy.

06:34.875 --> 06:36.708
Aw man!
It's a dude.

06:38.708 --> 06:40.291
How 'bout them sports?

06:44.708 --> 06:46.458
Donny!

06:47.125 --> 06:49.291
Donny!

06:49.291 --> 06:51.458
Harper, stop your racket.

06:51.458 --> 06:55.000
You moved out of our basement.
You don't have to wake up crying
anymore.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.416
That's not me.

06:59.708 --> 07:02.000
Donny!

07:02.000 --> 07:04.375
Oh, no. Ghosty ain't in her bed!

07:05.875 --> 07:07.708
Donny!

07:08.875 --> 07:10.375
Lucy, what are you doing?

07:11.208 --> 07:13.291
Haunting!

07:14.291 --> 07:16.583
Hey, keep it down out here.

07:16.583 --> 07:19.250
I mean, I can't even
hear myself "moving on."

07:23.583 --> 07:25.291
There she is, Dexter.

07:25.291 --> 07:26.875
There's the ghost
who woke me up.

07:30.500 --> 07:33.375
Hugh Normous? You live here?

07:33.375 --> 07:35.208
Yeah, I just moved in.

07:35.208 --> 07:37.875
But if this haunting stuff
keeps up, I'll be moving out.

07:37.875 --> 07:40.458
She scared me so much
I had to hide under my bed.

07:41.875 --> 07:45.166
And that's tough
for a giant. Look...

07:50.583 --> 07:52.583
OK, ladies,
you know the rules.

07:52.583 --> 07:57.833
No loud music, no parties,
and no haunting after nine.

08:02.500 --> 08:04.250
I'm so sorry.

08:04.250 --> 08:07.291
Haunting is just the way that
ghosts express their sadness.

08:07.291 --> 08:09.458
Why are you so sad?

08:09.458 --> 08:11.833
Is it because Harper ate
all your oatmeal cookies?

08:13.583 --> 08:16.875
Hey, We ate those,
and we agreed not to tell her!

08:16.875 --> 08:19.291
No, it's...
it's not that.

08:19.291 --> 08:23.500
Sixty years ago I lost
my true love, Donny Fasio,

08:23.500 --> 08:26.166
and my heartache makes
me haunt every night.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.500
I'll understand if you
want me to move out.

08:29.500 --> 08:32.083
Oh, honey...

08:33.333 --> 08:34.375
...be out by morning.

08:36.458 --> 08:39.291
Harper, we can't
let her move out.

08:39.291 --> 08:41.833
- We need her dirty rent money.
- All right, fine!

08:42.875 --> 08:44.291
Lucy...

08:44.291 --> 08:47.625
Look, we just... we just need
to find you a new boyfriend.

08:47.625 --> 08:50.458
Someone that'll take
your mind off your lost love.

08:50.458 --> 08:53.000
I don't think
I'm ready for that.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.708
It's been 60 years.
How much more time do you need?

08:55.708 --> 08:59.208
OK, I'll try.

09:01.083 --> 09:04.875
Cookies! Cookies!

09:06.416 --> 09:08.416
I also miss my oatmeal
cookies, you two.

09:19.875 --> 09:24.208
Hey, Justin. Robuddy is awesome!
I love working here now!

09:24.208 --> 09:27.458
Oh, well, good. I'll talk
to my dad about bringing
you on full time

09:27.458 --> 09:29.333
so you can quit your
baby-sitting job.

09:31.750 --> 09:34.416
Oh, oh, oh, check out
our lunchtime entertainment.

09:34.416 --> 09:36.000
Show him, Robuddy.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.375
Huh?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.375
I do not know how I
didn't see that coming.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.708
Is Justin studying
for the wizard competition?

09:53.708 --> 09:55.166
Yeah, he's been
studying for...

09:55.166 --> 09:58.583
Wait... how do you know
about the wizard competition?

10:04.333 --> 10:06.333
All right! Ohh!

10:07.000 --> 10:08.583
I like your moves!

10:13.708 --> 10:15.458
Boo!

10:15.458 --> 10:17.958
It's funny.
It's a ghost. Get it?

10:17.958 --> 10:21.166
No, it's not funny. You made me
spill my relaxation tea.

10:22.583 --> 10:24.708
What do you want, Alex?
I'm very busy studying.

10:24.708 --> 10:28.125
We're here to introduce you
to our new roommate, Lucy.

10:28.125 --> 10:30.458
We know You like girls
from the wizard world.

10:34.875 --> 10:38.166
He is kind of cute.
Why would a vampire dump him?

10:38.166 --> 10:39.458
I was not dumped!

10:39.458 --> 10:42.166
She got old and she
hobbled off into the forest!

10:42.166 --> 10:43.708
It happens!

10:45.625 --> 10:48.500
OK, well, this is Lucy.

10:48.500 --> 10:51.708
I'm not really good at playing
Cupid, so let's just get to it.

10:51.708 --> 10:53.750
You need to date her.

10:53.750 --> 10:56.833
Sorry, I cannot help you, Alex,
because I am busy studying.

10:56.833 --> 10:59.291
He's a softy.
Just tell him your story.

11:00.583 --> 11:03.083
OK... Um, well...

11:03.083 --> 11:05.166
My boyfriend, Donny,
was an aviator,

11:05.166 --> 11:06.833
and he took off on
a transatlantic flight

11:06.833 --> 11:09.000
and his plane
was mysteriously lost.

11:09.000 --> 11:13.166
Transatlantic?
Mysteriously lost?

11:14.375 --> 11:15.833
Interesting.

11:15.833 --> 11:18.833
Have you ever heard
of the Bermuda Triangle?

11:18.833 --> 11:21.375
Isn't that the place
where ships and planes
mysteriously disappear?

11:21.375 --> 11:25.500
Yes. Now tell me,
was he flying southeast,
northwest...

11:25.500 --> 11:28.000
Um, we're trying to get her
mind off of the boyfriend.

11:28.000 --> 11:29.708
So will you just
ask her out?

11:29.708 --> 11:30.958
Right.

11:30.958 --> 11:33.125
Lucy, I have to ask you
something very important.

11:33.125 --> 11:34.458
Yes?

11:34.458 --> 11:37.166
What kind of plane
was he flying?

11:37.166 --> 11:39.708
- Justin!
- What...?

11:39.708 --> 11:41.875
I don't know.

11:41.875 --> 11:43.958
Doesn't matter, anyway.
No plane could have survived

11:43.958 --> 11:45.625
the magnetic forces
of the Triangle.

11:49.375 --> 11:52.333
Well, this was a bust.
Way to go, Romeo.

11:53.833 --> 11:57.375
I'm terribly sorry for your
devastatingly mysterious loss.

12:05.875 --> 12:10.250
OK, so I got us some things
to help drown out Lucy's
haunting tonight.

12:10.250 --> 12:14.000
- First, I put in the earplugs.
- All right.

12:14.000 --> 12:17.416
- Then, put on earmuffs...
- Nice.

12:17.416 --> 12:21.083
...and after
that, wrap my head in a scarf.

12:23.166 --> 12:25.333
- What do you think?
- It's not bad.

12:25.333 --> 12:27.500
- What?
- Not bad.

12:27.500 --> 12:29.208
- What?
- It works!

12:29.208 --> 12:30.416
OK.

12:32.166 --> 12:34.250
Hey guys,
how do I look?

12:34.250 --> 12:36.291
What?!

12:36.291 --> 12:38.416
I met a really cute guy
and we're going on a date.

12:38.416 --> 12:40.166
Oh, really?
That's great!

12:40.166 --> 12:42.708
This is exactly what
you need to get your
mind off your lost love.

12:42.708 --> 12:45.416
Goodbye, Donny.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.583
That's him.

12:51.125 --> 12:54.458
Ugh! It's just Mason.

12:54.458 --> 12:56.333
Look, Mason, I told you,
I'm not interested...

12:56.333 --> 12:58.208
Actually, I'm here
for Lucy.

12:58.208 --> 13:01.208
You look lovely.
Ready to go?

13:07.708 --> 13:10.458
Really, Mason? You're taking
my roommate out on a date?

13:10.458 --> 13:12.166
You're obviously just
trying to make me jealous.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.583
No, I moved on.

13:13.583 --> 13:15.875
You only moved on this far!

13:17.625 --> 13:20.000
Alex, I didn't know
you guys have a history.

13:20.000 --> 13:22.000
If it's a problem,
I won't go out with him.

13:23.000 --> 13:24.458
Is it a problem?

13:25.875 --> 13:27.583
No. No. Mm-mm.

13:27.583 --> 13:29.708
No problem.

13:29.708 --> 13:32.333
Really? Because that fake smile
says "problem" to me.

13:33.416 --> 13:36.000
No. No, no, no.
Go. Have fun.

13:36.000 --> 13:38.208
OK, then.
Let's go, Lucy.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.458
I've got a romantic
evening planned.

13:40.458 --> 13:43.208
First a romantic dinner,
then a romantic movie,

13:43.208 --> 13:45.166
and then a romantic walk.

13:45.166 --> 13:48.875
Oh, you want to know what else
is romantic? When you get wolfed
up and eat a rat.

13:48.875 --> 13:51.458
Don't forget to show her that!

13:55.166 --> 13:58.125
Nice work today, Robuddy.
We're a great team.

13:58.125 --> 14:00.625
Yes we are, boss man.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.208
Where is the Wizards' Lair?

14:06.208 --> 14:08.875
Oh, it's just
through the... Hey...

14:10.166 --> 14:11.375
What did you just ask me?

14:11.375 --> 14:14.333
Where is the Wizards' Lair?

14:16.416 --> 14:18.583
Tell me.

14:19.708 --> 14:21.333
Uh... Justin?

14:22.083 --> 14:23.583
Um... Justin?

14:25.083 --> 14:26.250
Justin!

14:27.750 --> 14:30.458
Zeke, I get it.
You found a new dance partner.

14:30.458 --> 14:32.375
That's terrific
and I'm happy for you.

14:32.375 --> 14:35.625
No! That thing just asked
about the Wizard Lair.

14:35.625 --> 14:40.083
Boss man is mistaken.
I asked about a layer cake.

14:40.083 --> 14:42.083
The seven layer cake.

14:42.083 --> 14:45.708
- He's lying!
- Robots don't lie, Zeke.

14:45.708 --> 14:49.375
The dark-haired
handsome one is right.

14:50.333 --> 14:51.875
See?

14:51.875 --> 14:55.166
No! Don't leave me
alone with him.

14:55.166 --> 14:56.375
Look at him stare at me!

14:58.833 --> 15:01.125
Relax, Zeke.
He's not staring at you.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.416
He has no eyes.

15:03.416 --> 15:05.166
If anything,
he's scanning you.

15:08.333 --> 15:11.000
Boss man has a big mouth.

15:12.375 --> 15:14.250
Listen, Robuddy, I don't
know what you're up to,

15:14.250 --> 15:15.375
but I don't like it!

15:19.875 --> 15:22.375
Scan of Zeke complete.

15:34.625 --> 15:36.833
My gosh!
Harper, wake up!

15:36.833 --> 15:40.166
- I found him!
- Who, Jeremy from science?

15:41.750 --> 15:44.375
Oh, this is terrible timing.
I'm with Zeke now.

15:45.625 --> 15:48.000
No, I found
Lucy's boyfriend.

15:48.000 --> 15:51.000
Justin was right. He's lost
in the Bermuda Triangle.

15:52.708 --> 15:55.708
Oh, I get it.

15:55.708 --> 15:58.000
Lucy's not back
from her date with Mason.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.333
Is somebody a little jealous?

16:02.875 --> 16:04.458
What? That's ridiculous.

16:04.458 --> 16:06.583
Look, I did some research.

16:06.583 --> 16:10.291
I checked compass variations
against the weather patterns
that night.

16:10.291 --> 16:12.875
Now, if I did my math correct,

16:12.875 --> 16:16.875
Donny's plane landed
somewhere right... here.

16:16.875 --> 16:19.083
Oh, my gosh!

16:19.083 --> 16:20.083
You did math?

16:22.208 --> 16:24.291
You are so jealous!

16:25.458 --> 16:28.333
Hey! How was your date?
Where did he take you?

16:28.333 --> 16:30.875
Did he try to impress you by
running faster than a squirrel?

16:30.875 --> 16:33.500
Yes! He's so cute.

16:33.500 --> 16:36.333
- And tomorrow night we're...
- I think I found Donny!

16:36.333 --> 16:39.166
What?! Where is he?

16:39.166 --> 16:42.708
I believe he's on some island
in the Bermuda Triangle.

16:42.708 --> 16:45.208
- Now, let's go find him!
- Alex!

16:45.208 --> 16:46.708
I can't believe
you did this for me.

16:46.708 --> 16:49.458
- Well...
- Well, that's Alex for ya.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.833
Always thinking of others.

16:51.833 --> 16:55.166
With no ulterior
motive whatsoever.

16:57.333 --> 17:00.875
She just gives and gives,
just keeps on giving...

17:00.875 --> 17:02.875
Let's get out of here.

17:02.875 --> 17:06.375
Always thinking of others.

17:06.375 --> 17:09.708
Oh, maybe this is someone else
she can do something nice for.

17:14.208 --> 17:16.291
Is Lucy here?

17:16.291 --> 17:19.458
She seems to have
forgotten some of her
lipstick on my face and...

17:20.875 --> 17:23.166
- Where's Alex?
- She's not here.

17:23.166 --> 17:26.250
Oh, kippers! Now I have to
draw these on again tomorrow.

17:27.708 --> 17:29.291
Lucy's not here, either.

17:29.291 --> 17:32.000
Sorry, they went to go
find her lost love
in the Bermuda Triangle.

17:32.000 --> 17:34.208
The Bermuda Triangle?

17:34.208 --> 17:36.708
No, no, no, I can't believe
she would take that risk!

17:36.708 --> 17:38.625
I have to go and get Alex!

17:38.625 --> 17:40.583
I mean, Lucy!

17:40.583 --> 17:43.000
Oh, mushy peas, I mean Alex!

17:48.291 --> 17:50.583
Are you sure that this is
the island where Donny landed?

17:50.583 --> 17:53.625
Well, when it comes
to my magic, it doesn't
usually go as I planned,

17:53.625 --> 17:55.625
but I am encouraged
by the fact

17:55.625 --> 17:58.000
that there is a ghost
over there by an old airplane.

17:59.458 --> 18:01.708
- Donny?
- Lucy?!

18:05.708 --> 18:07.208
Oh, my gosh.
It's like he's seen a ghost.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.875
How many times
do you get to use that one,
right?

18:09.875 --> 18:12.458
Lucy! I can't believe
you're here.

18:12.458 --> 18:15.000
I lost hope of ever
seeing you again.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.958
Donny, this is Alex.
She helped me find you.

18:17.958 --> 18:20.583
Thank you for reuniting me
with my love, Lucy,

18:20.583 --> 18:24.250
and bringing her
to this lonely, lonely island.

18:24.250 --> 18:26.250
There is no one to talk to here

18:26.250 --> 18:29.375
except the tribe of monkeys I've
been feuding with over coconuts.

18:29.375 --> 18:31.833
Coconut!

18:33.416 --> 18:35.708
Ha! It's mine now!

18:37.500 --> 18:39.458
Aww. I did a good thing.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.708
Uh, Lucy? Hey...

18:45.083 --> 18:46.708
Uh, if you're gonna stay here,

18:46.708 --> 18:49.583
there's a small fee for
leaving the apartment early.

18:49.583 --> 18:51.125
Three months' rent
should be good.

18:51.125 --> 18:53.291
Of course.

18:53.291 --> 18:54.708
Oh, I forgot my purse.

18:54.708 --> 18:56.291
Oh, it's OK.
I'll dig through it myself.

19:01.166 --> 19:03.000
That's weird.
My wand isn't working.

19:03.000 --> 19:06.625
Uh, that's the thing
about the Bermuda Triangle.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.833
Once you're here,
you can't get out.

19:09.958 --> 19:13.000
Oh my gosh,
I'm stuck on this island?!

19:13.000 --> 19:15.500
Well, now this feels like
one of my plans.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.625
Hey! Hey, what are you
doing in here?

19:24.625 --> 19:28.208
Nothing, boss man.
Just a little light reading.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.625
Hey! Hey, I didn't
program you to do that.

19:36.333 --> 19:38.375
Justin, have you
seen the...?

19:38.375 --> 19:40.625
I knew there was something
wrong with this robot!

19:40.625 --> 19:43.500
- Now do you believe me, Justin?
- Shut up and help me out, Zeke!

19:43.500 --> 19:44.875
OK. Hah!

19:51.583 --> 19:53.458
Later, losers.

19:55.458 --> 19:58.833
- What the heck was that?
- It must've malfunctioned.

19:58.833 --> 20:01.875
I came in and he was
scanning my spell book.

20:01.875 --> 20:04.333
A large robot just sprinted
out of the restaurant.

20:04.333 --> 20:07.333
It appears that even people who
don't eat food hate your food.

20:07.333 --> 20:10.333
- He... He ran away?
- Yes, but we've got
bigger problems.

20:10.333 --> 20:13.625
Alex has run off with Lucy
to the Bermuda Triangle.
We've got to go find her.

20:13.625 --> 20:15.125
OK, you're gonna have to
go do that by yourself,

20:15.125 --> 20:16.833
because there's something
going on with that robot.

20:16.833 --> 20:18.625
Fine. Flash me there.
I'll bring her back.

20:18.625 --> 20:21.458
It's not that easy.
Magic doesn't always work
in the Triangle.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.250
You're gonna need these.

20:25.083 --> 20:28.708
Bermuda shorts.
Put them on.

20:28.708 --> 20:31.708
They get rid of
the magnetic current that
interferes with our magic.

20:33.583 --> 20:35.458
Toad in a hole,
these are horrid.

20:38.625 --> 20:42.833
Good luck. Up, down, up, down,
circle, square, triangle.

20:42.833 --> 20:44.166
I didn't think those
shorts were that bad.

20:44.166 --> 20:45.750
- I got a pair just
like 'em at home.
- I know you do.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.958
That's why we don't hang out
in the summertime. Come on.

20:53.583 --> 20:55.750
Oh, my gosh. There has to be
a way out of here.

20:58.208 --> 21:02.000
Mason! You came for me!

21:02.000 --> 21:04.250
You did come for me, right?
Because Lucy's already
with someone,

21:04.250 --> 21:06.750
so forget that, that's over.

21:06.750 --> 21:08.375
Yes, I'm here for you.

21:08.375 --> 21:11.291
Once I heard you went
on this wild quest
to find Lucy's lost love,

21:11.291 --> 21:13.625
I knew you still had
feelings for me.

21:13.625 --> 21:16.000
What?

21:16.000 --> 21:20.625
You...? OK, you think
I went on this crazy,
dangerous expedition

21:20.625 --> 21:23.208
just because I was a
little jealous over a guy

21:23.208 --> 21:26.375
wearing the ugliest shorts
I've ever seen in my life?

21:26.375 --> 21:29.458
These magical Bermuda shorts
happen to be our only way
out of here.

21:29.458 --> 21:31.583
Well, then I love them.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.958
I bet these shorts look uglier
on me than they do on you.

21:35.958 --> 21:40.291
Oh, you want
an ugly contest?
Bring it on.

21:41.958 --> 21:44.125
Never mind. You win.

21:45.166 --> 21:46.458
Shut up!

21:48.208 --> 21:51.333
Those two
are so in love.

21:51.333 --> 21:54.416
All right, let's get
go before the monkeys
throw coconuts at us

21:54.416 --> 21:55.958
because we're
wearing these shorts.

22:02.250 --> 22:04.291
Do you have
the spell for me?

22:04.291 --> 22:05.416
Yes.

22:07.708 --> 22:11.625
Here is the "In Through
The Out Door" spell,
Master Gorog.

22:11.625 --> 22:13.750
Shh! Not here.

22:13.750 --> 22:15.500
I'm undercover.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.833
No one knows what's coming.

22:25.583 --> 22:29.375
I know, the evil laugh doesn't
really work with this face.
