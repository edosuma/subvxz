00:09.000 --> 00:11.560
(narrator)
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:12.640 --> 00:14.400
'This time it's all-stars.'

00:14.480 --> 00:18.320
'Old faces return for another shot
at finding love.'

00:18.400 --> 00:20.560
Am I looking for love? Fucking yeah!

00:20.640 --> 00:22.840
"They'll have
to endure their exes...'

00:23.840 --> 00:25.760
I've never felt like this
in my life.

00:25.840 --> 00:28.720
'Some will have
to deal with old grudges...'

00:29.920 --> 00:32.600
Babe, you've had more dicks
than I've had sunbeds.

00:32.680 --> 00:36.000
'As hard as they try
to find their perfect match...'

00:36.080 --> 00:38.120
Right. Who wants to finger me?

00:38.200 --> 00:41.640
'...standing in their way again
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:42.680 --> 00:45.440
I won't lie.
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:45.520 --> 00:48.200
'It's going to be hotter
than ever before...'

00:48.280 --> 00:52.400
I wanna ride her. Giddy up, Amy.
'...as emotions boil over...'

00:52.480 --> 00:56.120
You made me realise there's more
to life than what I was just doing.

00:56.200 --> 01:00.040
'...tensions run high...'
I fucking dare you!

01:00.120 --> 01:01.920
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:02.000 --> 01:05.160
'...and the claws come out.'
...in your face...

01:05.239 --> 01:06.880
(shouting)

01:06.960 --> 01:10.120
'So far, eight exes have arrived.'

01:11.400 --> 01:14.040
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:19.360 --> 01:22.160
I did not think that
I was gonna feel like this.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

01:38.200 --> 01:40.760
How are you?
Yeah, don't touch me.

01:40.840 --> 01:44.360
Conor, I know that you shagged
half of fucking Dstrkt.

01:44.440 --> 01:45.560
Fucking admit it!

01:45.640 --> 01:48.080
Dare.
Lick Kayleigh's tits.

01:48.160 --> 01:50.120
Winding me up?
(laughs)

01:50.200 --> 01:52.160
Holly or Kayleigh?
Kayleigh.

01:54.240 --> 01:56.160
Fuck Jordan or get back with Conor.

01:56.240 --> 01:58.640
I'd rather fuck Jordan.
I'll do it now.

01:58.720 --> 02:00.160
Fuck off!

02:00.240 --> 02:02.400
I went with Jordan
to piss Conor off.

02:02.480 --> 02:06.080
The date is going really,
really well. I fancy him.

02:06.160 --> 02:08.680
(cheering)

02:08.759 --> 02:11.560
Thank fuck
Charlotte's got too pissed

02:11.640 --> 02:13.120
and she's gone to bed early,

02:13.200 --> 02:16.640
as it leaves me to swoop in
and crack on with Christine.

02:19.320 --> 02:24.480
She's smoking. She ticks
all the boxes. I'm excited.

02:24.560 --> 02:27.240
I'm sorry for the way
I treated you.

02:30.160 --> 02:31.240
Oh, my God.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.960
So, why are you here?
I wanna see where I stand with Gaz.

02:37.040 --> 02:39.960
Yeah.
I'll happily just crack on.

02:40.040 --> 02:43.000
What the fuck are you doing
with your hands all over her?

02:43.720 --> 02:47.240
While Gaz was with Lillie,
did you get together?

02:47.320 --> 02:48.640
Yeah.

02:51.160 --> 02:53.280
I'm so embarrassed.

02:54.040 --> 02:57.400
I was in Australia with him.
Like, I was there.

02:58.240 --> 03:00.120
Stop it. Stop it.

03:03.360 --> 03:07.480
What the fuck is this villa
gonna be like tomorrow?

03:07.560 --> 03:08.920
Fucking bring it on.

03:21.240 --> 03:25.320
I'm feeling, this morning,
absolutely fucked.

03:25.400 --> 03:28.000
Why didn't he come and check on me
to see if I was OK?

03:28.080 --> 03:30.800
I expected to wake up
with Jordan next to me,

03:30.880 --> 03:33.520
checking if I was all right.
I could've died.

03:33.600 --> 03:37.080
But no. He ended up in bed with her
when I'm fucking passed out.

03:46.800 --> 03:49.080
I believe everything happens
for a reason.

03:49.160 --> 03:51.440
Charlotte got fucked
and went to be early.

03:51.520 --> 03:54.520
She hasn't met Chrysten yet
and I'm in bed with her.

03:54.600 --> 03:57.280
Game changer. Swoopy, swoop, swoop.

04:04.520 --> 04:09.280
Jordan reminds me of myself.
Really ditsy, clumsy, kinda dumb.

04:09.360 --> 04:12.680
And I just don't think
I want that in my life.

04:13.920 --> 04:16.519
Out of everyone,
I wanna get with Conor most.

04:16.600 --> 04:19.640
I'm hoping that me and Conor
can properly sort things out

04:19.720 --> 04:22.920
and actually move forward
from all the shit from the past.

04:30.240 --> 04:33.480
I feel like I was in love
with somebody that doesn't exist

04:33.560 --> 04:38.240
and I just never
want to speak to him again. Ever.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.120
I feel like shit.

05:01.200 --> 05:03.920
It's just now
a very awkward situation.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.400
You're living in a villa
with your ex-girlfriend

05:07.480 --> 05:11.440
and a girl you slept with behind her
back. When does that even happen?

05:12.720 --> 05:16.520
I do really fancy Gary,
but Chrysten being here

05:16.600 --> 05:18.560
has put a spanner in the works.

05:18.640 --> 05:20.640
I can't just let him mug me off,

05:20.720 --> 05:23.680
but I know what I'm like
after a few drinks, so.

05:31.360 --> 05:33.240
'After a stressful night,

05:33.320 --> 05:35.560
the Tablet's decided to
cheer everyone up

05:35.640 --> 05:38.000
by sending them to a waterpark

05:38.080 --> 05:40.960
with a big, pink elephant.
That should do the trick.'

05:41.800 --> 05:45.080
I love fun, right?
And because I'm at a waterpark,

05:45.160 --> 05:48.520
today will be the best day ever!

06:08.720 --> 06:12.200
Me, Kayleigh and Holly
have all got something in common.

06:12.280 --> 06:15.720
Jordan. He keeps slipping fingers
up the three of us.

06:15.800 --> 06:18.040
He's been second best to all of us.

06:18.120 --> 06:21.720
I only did it to piss off Conor.
You did it because Bear was a prick.

06:21.800 --> 06:22.920
Yeah.

06:26.640 --> 06:29.680
The only reason any of us girls
got anywhere near Jordan

06:29.760 --> 06:32.200
is because there's no-one else left.

06:32.280 --> 06:35.880
Literally, as soon as Chrysten
said that he was the best looking,

06:35.960 --> 06:38.920
he was over there in 30 seconds.
Oh, my God.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.880
And the fact that he was whispering
in my ear all night.

06:41.960 --> 06:45.400
Oh, like, "We're the power couple.
We're this. We're that."

06:45.480 --> 06:48.160
He thinks he's
the dog's bollocks with the birds.

06:48.240 --> 06:50.760
Trying to get
another finger on his bedpost.

06:50.840 --> 06:51.840
I know.

06:51.920 --> 06:55.800
I'll tell you what. His fingers
must be absolutely wrinkled to fuck.

06:55.880 --> 06:58.600
Can't be arsed now.
You've fucked it, mate.

06:58.680 --> 07:01.760
Jordan is walking around
like he's king today.

07:01.840 --> 07:04.720
It's embarrassing.
Everyone's just laughing at him.

07:15.360 --> 07:17.920
I feel like the only person in here

07:18.000 --> 07:22.400
that just completely takes my mind
off Gary and that situation is Bear.

07:22.480 --> 07:24.640
Like, he's just fun and positive

07:24.720 --> 07:27.480
and just a wicked person
to be around.

07:30.240 --> 07:32.080
I know last night was difficult.

07:32.920 --> 07:35.200
I can see in your eyes
you're not happy,

07:35.280 --> 07:37.120
but I wanna make you smile again.

07:37.200 --> 07:40.560
I appreciated you coming over...
Yeah.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.800
...and talking to me.

07:41.880 --> 07:43.800
And it was nice to see, like,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.160
a completely different side
to you as well.

07:46.240 --> 07:48.880
Cos I've only really seen the silly,

07:48.960 --> 07:51.840
hyper wind-up side before that.

07:51.920 --> 07:55.480
If I didn't care about you,
I wouldn't have spoken like I did.

07:55.560 --> 07:57.320
You dealt with it in a good way.

07:57.400 --> 07:59.720
Lillie's in a bad place
at the minute.

07:59.800 --> 08:02.120
It's come at
a good time for me, really.

08:02.200 --> 08:05.560
Maybe it's my chance to show
what a real man I am,

08:05.640 --> 08:09.240
and comfort her. "It's all right.
I know all men are horrible."

08:09.320 --> 08:10.440
"I mean it."

08:11.200 --> 08:14.080
I think we should move on,
put it under the carpet.

08:14.160 --> 08:16.600
I think me and you could be
a really good thing.

08:16.680 --> 08:18.600
I've never met anyone like you.

08:18.680 --> 08:23.040
You're smart and you're caring
and obviously really pretty.

08:23.120 --> 08:25.880
(laughs)
And you are good at kissing.

08:25.960 --> 08:29.560
Bear is definitely
a welcome distraction.

08:29.640 --> 08:32.520
Bear and Lillie.
(both) Billie.

08:32.600 --> 08:34.400
(laughs)

08:42.240 --> 08:45.240
Lillie is looking so fit right now.

08:45.320 --> 08:49.080
I wanna give her a kiss,
touch her nun and get her nips out.

08:50.080 --> 08:52.560
Time and a place, though, right?
Later!

08:53.520 --> 08:56.160
'There's a time and place
for everything, Bear.'

08:56.240 --> 08:59.440
'In fact, it's almost time
to meet the new arrival.'

08:59.520 --> 09:01.720
'T minus 18 hours.'

09:06.920 --> 09:08.280
Woo.
Woo!

09:09.320 --> 09:11.480
Can't wait to get drunk and fucked.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.840
Unexpectedly,
I am getting on so well with Ash.

09:18.920 --> 09:21.520
It's a natural process.
We haven't been on a date.

09:25.800 --> 09:30.360
I'm enjoying spending time with him.
He makes me feel good, unlike Hawley.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.200
I've been in the sun!
You're red as well.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.440
I'm not blushing.
Your face is red, fam.

09:42.520 --> 09:45.800
I can't say whether Jemma's
doing this to get back at Hawley

09:45.880 --> 09:47.280
or cos she likes me.

09:47.360 --> 09:51.200
I don't care. I'm enjoying it
and hope something happens tonight.

09:53.600 --> 09:55.160
Gemma knows that Ash is my ex.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.880
I openly said,
"I still have feelings for Ashley."

09:57.960 --> 09:59.400
I do not trust the girl

09:59.480 --> 10:02.240
and she goes off
and flirts with Ashley.

10:02.320 --> 10:04.040
What the fuck is she playing at?

10:08.840 --> 10:11.320
'With Holly hoping
to make amends with Conor,

10:11.400 --> 10:13.240
the Tablet has sent them on a date.'

10:13.320 --> 10:16.840
'In a bush, with a Thai lady.
That's bound to help.'

10:17.920 --> 10:19.720
Me and Conor have had a bumpy ride,

10:19.800 --> 10:23.120
but this date is the perfect
opportunity to sort things out.

10:26.160 --> 10:27.680
I came here to get with Holly,

10:27.760 --> 10:30.760
so I don't wanna ruin a friendship
or possibly more

10:30.840 --> 10:32.640
over a few silly arguments.

10:36.520 --> 10:39.480
Conor thinks that he's MasterChef,
but he's not.

10:39.560 --> 10:41.680
His, like, specialty's
beans on toast.

10:41.760 --> 10:45.040
Put in and bang, bang on.

10:45.120 --> 10:47.160
Break the chilli and garlic.

10:47.240 --> 10:50.240
For once, me and Holly,
we're not bringing up the past.

10:50.320 --> 10:54.040
It's all positive. We're both happy,
both smiling. Happy days.

10:54.120 --> 10:56.560
Hang on. Go on. These are mine.
Looks good.

10:56.640 --> 10:58.360
Come on.
(laughs)

10:58.440 --> 11:00.840
Don't tease me! Put it in, then!

11:00.920 --> 11:02.160
Come on.

11:03.120 --> 11:04.600
(laughs) Stop it!

11:04.680 --> 11:07.920
We've got chemistry, great banter.
We've always had a laugh.

11:08.000 --> 11:10.160
I like the girl
and wanna sort things out.

11:10.240 --> 11:14.200
I'll make a pinky promise that
I'm not gonna go with anybody else.

11:14.280 --> 11:17.200
I'm not either.
I wanna spend time with you.

11:17.280 --> 11:19.360
You happy? You sure?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.800
A kiss? You sure?

11:26.320 --> 11:28.960
I am happy that me and Conor
have cleared the air.

11:29.040 --> 11:32.000
I feel like he's taken our
relationship to a new level.

11:39.760 --> 11:41.720
Who wants to play a game tonight?

11:41.800 --> 11:43.000
(women) Me!
OK.

11:43.080 --> 11:46.360
I love games.
Hold on a minute, love.

11:46.440 --> 11:47.560
Guess the kisser.

11:48.680 --> 11:51.520
One, two, three.

11:51.600 --> 11:55.280
We're all playing games.
Tonight could not be going better.

11:55.360 --> 11:57.440
Who do you reckon the kisser was?

11:58.440 --> 11:59.880
Olivia.

11:59.960 --> 12:01.720
No. Guess again.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.640
Take a shot, Gaz.

12:05.480 --> 12:06.920
Oh, shit.

12:08.760 --> 12:12.680
Two, three, four, five.

12:15.680 --> 12:17.600
(laughs)
Oh, my God.

12:18.800 --> 12:21.040
Guess the lap dancer.

12:21.120 --> 12:22.440
You ready?

12:22.520 --> 12:26.760
It's Lillie's turn to get a dance
and Bear picks Gaz of all people.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.560
How weird is that?
What's this guy thinking?

12:29.640 --> 12:32.880
We're gonna rock and roll with this.
This over here...

12:32.960 --> 12:35.560
(women) Whoa!
Gonna get raunchy.

12:35.640 --> 12:37.120
And go!

12:42.680 --> 12:44.400
What the hell is he doing?

12:44.480 --> 12:46.600
(laughter)

12:50.560 --> 12:52.360
This is mega awks.

12:52.440 --> 12:54.840
You can kiss him at the end.
It's your choice.

12:59.400 --> 13:02.920
Ready? Who do you think it was,
that nutty lap dance?

13:03.000 --> 13:05.080
Gary.
How'd you know?

13:05.160 --> 13:08.200
How'd you know it was Gary?
I just know.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.880
Gary always used to
kiss me on the forehead

13:10.960 --> 13:14.720
and I just feel like it's
a really cruel thing for him to do

13:14.800 --> 13:17.360
because he knows
that I'm gonna know that's him.

13:17.440 --> 13:19.920
I think he just knew that I'd know.

13:33.400 --> 13:36.440
I didn't realise
that was gonna get that reaction.

13:36.520 --> 13:40.000
Lillie's crying and I'm confused
cos after what's gone on

13:40.080 --> 13:42.520
and the way she was with Bear
at the waterpark,

13:42.600 --> 13:43.840
I thought we were done.

13:48.360 --> 13:53.160
Lillie, babe, get over it.
You and Gary have split up now.

13:53.240 --> 13:57.440
You're with Bear. You've been
snogging his face all fucking day.

13:57.520 --> 13:59.120
Why are you crying?

14:00.080 --> 14:03.720
'Don't worry, Olivia, you'll all
be crying tide bucket loads

14:03.800 --> 14:05.440
when the next ex lands.'

14:05.520 --> 14:08.320
'T minus 12 hours.'

14:11.440 --> 14:14.280
'It's no secret Jordan
pulled Chrysten last night

14:14.360 --> 14:17.200
because he's telling everyone.'

14:24.320 --> 14:27.240
Chrysten's the fresh meat.
Everybody wants a piece,

14:27.320 --> 14:29.880
but she wants me.
No fucking surprise.

14:34.760 --> 14:37.400
Jordan D will do what
he fucking wants with his D.

14:42.520 --> 14:43.840
And Jordan's looking.

14:43.920 --> 14:46.760
Lions attacking each other
and I swoop in and take it.

14:48.040 --> 14:51.960
'Someone else hoping to swoop
in for the taking is Bear.'

14:52.040 --> 14:54.680
Lillie has convinced me
she's over Gaz.

15:01.440 --> 15:02.480
Guaranteed not.

15:08.480 --> 15:11.720
I don't care about the situation.
It bores me.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.360
Seeing Bear and Lillie neck,
for me, that is the green light

15:18.440 --> 15:20.920
that she's OK now
and I can go and shag.

15:24.400 --> 15:27.800
I shouldn't really go
to the penthouse with Gaz

15:27.880 --> 15:29.480
cos he did mug me off a bit.

15:33.840 --> 15:35.680
I just can't resist the parsnip.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.920
The safe option for me
is just to bang Olivia.

15:44.120 --> 15:48.520
'Time to find out how much D
Jordan D really does have.'

15:51.120 --> 15:52.160
Pardon?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.960
I wasn't different.

16:03.040 --> 16:05.200
I'm just still
getting to know everyone.

16:05.280 --> 16:09.320
Jordan is not sexy at all.
I need a man, not a little girl.

16:12.160 --> 16:15.720
Yeah, but it was my first night
and I was hanging out with you.

16:15.800 --> 16:18.200
Like, I, like, it's, you know...

16:21.840 --> 16:25.160
We're in here. We're having fun.
It's not like, you know?

16:29.440 --> 16:30.560
OK, well, OK.

16:30.640 --> 16:33.240
I don't know.
Like, we're having fun.

16:37.480 --> 16:40.600
What happened last night
didn't happen. I wanna carry on.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.880
'While Jordan tucks himself in,

16:44.960 --> 16:48.760
Ashley and Jemma
ease themselves into action.

16:50.520 --> 16:53.360
You need to use it.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:54.440 --> 16:57.680
Straight away, she draws the lube.
It's gonna be a good night.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.720
Sex with Ashley is fucking dirty
and that's how I like it.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.440
I walk into the bedroom...

17:16.640 --> 17:18.760
...and the first thing I see

17:18.839 --> 17:21.440
is Ashley smashing Jemma.

17:21.520 --> 17:23.160
You're fucking winding me up!

17:26.520 --> 17:27.680
(laughs)

17:29.000 --> 17:30.360
Is that funny, Kayleigh?

17:30.440 --> 17:32.240
What's funny?
Stop arguing.

17:32.320 --> 17:34.240
What's funny?
Oh, I'm going.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.400
I walk in to you fucking Ashley.
That's funny.

17:37.480 --> 17:40.640
Mate, you're naked in bed
with a guy I care about.

17:40.720 --> 17:44.240
Are you taking the fucking piss?
You dirty fucking skank.

17:44.320 --> 17:46.400
This is my fucking bedroom, Jem.

17:46.480 --> 17:49.040
I didn't know you were
gonna be shagging in here.

17:49.120 --> 17:50.400
Are you fucking joking?

17:50.480 --> 17:54.680
Kayleigh, why can't I get with Ash?
You're not with him, so do one.

17:54.760 --> 17:57.000
How many people is that now?

17:57.080 --> 17:58.200
Two still, babe.

17:58.280 --> 18:00.600
Two still?
Well, two more than me, babe.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.400
Fucking slut!

18:05.480 --> 18:09.120
Jemma and Ashley equal disgusting.

18:09.200 --> 18:10.680
I fucking hate her!

18:11.320 --> 18:13.280
Stupid little slut!

18:13.360 --> 18:16.280
She can fuck off. He can fuck off.

18:16.360 --> 18:19.080
They can both fuck off together.

18:19.160 --> 18:24.280
You know what? She fucking throws
people's fucking stuff.

18:24.360 --> 18:27.840
How about I throw
her fucking stuff in the pool?

18:27.920 --> 18:30.760
Karma's a bitch
and I'm gonna show her exactly

18:30.840 --> 18:33.480
how vicious I can fucking be.

18:33.560 --> 18:34.880
Get out!

18:53.120 --> 18:54.880
I wake up. It's been a good night.

18:54.960 --> 18:58.920
There's nothing better than
a morning blowjob to start the day.

19:01.200 --> 19:03.640
I'm feeling on top of the world
this morning.

19:03.720 --> 19:07.080
I'm in a happy bubble. Everything's
positive with me and Conor.

19:07.160 --> 19:08.920
I don't wanna get up.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.880
I'm starting to trust him and that
was the only problem before.

19:14.760 --> 19:18.160
This morning, I've woken up
with Princess Lillie.

19:18.240 --> 19:20.920
We're kissing. We're cuddling.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.240
I get bored very easily.

19:23.320 --> 19:26.720
Chrysten is a sort. She's gorgeous.

19:26.800 --> 19:30.160
And it's in my nature
to be very over-friendly with girls.

19:30.240 --> 19:32.840
My eyes are swaying, guys,
and I'm scared.

19:32.920 --> 19:36.480
I'd love to be inside your head
for five minutes.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.920
Do you know what?
I don't know what her problem is.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.000
All my stuff's been thrown.
Why is she getting involved?

19:54.080 --> 19:56.000
Who's throwing stuff?
Kayleigh.

19:56.080 --> 19:57.720
I come and my stuff's outside.

19:57.800 --> 19:59.840
You're joking.
No.

19:59.920 --> 20:02.840
I walk to the table
and Jemma's talking about it.

20:02.920 --> 20:06.280
She is annoyed because
I threw her stuff outside.

20:06.360 --> 20:09.000
Yet, didn't she do that twice
to Holly?

20:09.080 --> 20:11.720
She wants to know why
her clothes is everywhere.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.120
Why is up to you to throw my clothes?

20:18.480 --> 20:21.640
I wondered why you two came in,
knowing I'd gone with Ashley.

20:21.720 --> 20:24.640
You knew.
What do mean knowing you'd gone in?

20:24.720 --> 20:26.760
There's seven people
in that bedroom.

20:26.840 --> 20:30.280
Why would I think you've gone for
sex?There was nobody in there.

20:30.360 --> 20:33.320
One minute Kayleigh loves Ash.
The next, she hates him.

20:33.400 --> 20:34.400
Make your mind up.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.160
You can't pick and choose
cos you're jealous.

20:37.240 --> 20:40.000
You threw my stuff
cos you acted like a child

20:40.080 --> 20:41.880
because I'm getting with Ashley.

20:41.960 --> 20:44.560
Today over breakfast
was bloody awkward.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.360
All I wanted was a piece of bacon.

20:46.440 --> 20:47.760
(Tablet rings)

20:47.840 --> 20:49.640
(all) Oh!
Again!

20:50.320 --> 20:52.560
Tablet,
I don't think I like you today.

20:52.640 --> 20:56.520
Tablet of Terror, you mug!
(screams)

20:56.600 --> 20:59.200
"Afternoon, exes."

20:59.280 --> 21:02.960
"Don't get too comfortable.
It's beach time

21:03.040 --> 21:05.600
for Jordan, Jemma and Charlotte."

21:06.400 --> 21:08.920
Nice one, Tablet of Fucking Terror,
you prick.

21:09.000 --> 21:11.080
"The next ex is on their way."

21:11.960 --> 21:13.920
Oh, my God.

21:14.000 --> 21:16.760
That Tablet of Terror
ruined my chuffing life.

21:16.840 --> 21:18.520
(screams)

21:19.800 --> 21:20.840
Oh.

21:27.480 --> 21:30.480
I'm just feeling fucking petrified,
to be honest, Jem.

21:30.560 --> 21:33.360
I just feel like
it's all gonna go tits up.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.760
I'm feel like I'm gonna shit myself.

21:35.840 --> 21:37.520
Who do you think it's gonna be?

21:37.600 --> 21:40.400
I reckon it will be Rosine.
I was a prick to her.

21:40.480 --> 21:42.440
The Tablet must have it in for me.

21:42.520 --> 21:44.800
If my ex comes out,
it's not gonna go well.

21:45.840 --> 21:49.240
If it's mine, it will be Scott.

21:49.320 --> 21:52.000
He's the only person
that could fuck shit up.

21:52.080 --> 21:56.000
If Scott comes out of that water,
I will go fucking in on him.

21:56.720 --> 21:58.000
Oh, my God.

21:58.080 --> 22:01.640
My ex is called Alex.
I was with him for six years.

22:01.720 --> 22:04.680
It's a proper toxic,
fucked-up relationship.

22:05.520 --> 22:08.240
It's hard. Part of me wants
to get back with him.

22:10.320 --> 22:13.960
I've got a weird feeling today
that something bad is coming.

22:14.040 --> 22:15.200
Please don't come in.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.320
(screams)

22:22.080 --> 22:25.320
# Body shakes from left to right

22:25.400 --> 22:28.560
# Earth is falling out of sight

22:28.640 --> 22:34.640
# I'm scared cos I don't wanna die #

22:34.720 --> 22:36.400
Oh, my God

22:36.480 --> 22:38.880
Oh, my fucking God. Like, it's Alex.

22:38.960 --> 22:40.120
Ahh!

22:40.200 --> 22:41.840
There's so much history.

22:41.920 --> 22:44.840
So much passion, so much emotion.

22:44.920 --> 22:47.600
My head is literally everywhere
at the moment.

22:51.080 --> 22:54.440
My name's Alex. I'm an ex-army
commando and I'm from Blackpool.

22:57.440 --> 23:00.400
I'm down to Earth. I'm not arrogant,
not full of myself.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.280
I'm just a lad.

23:02.360 --> 23:06.720
I'm competitive, so women, work.
I wanna win everything that I do.

23:07.400 --> 23:10.800
My ex is the love of my life.
I was with her for so long.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.080
In an ideal world, we'd be together,

23:13.160 --> 23:17.760
but she just fucked it up. She was
texting every lad under the sun.

23:17.840 --> 23:21.160
She's a bit of a pathological liar
and she can't be trusted.

23:22.520 --> 23:25.120
You excited to see Charlotte?
I love you and that,

23:25.200 --> 23:29.200
but love's not really enough when
you've been pretty shady and that.

23:29.280 --> 23:31.040
With Alex in front of me,

23:31.120 --> 23:34.000
I've got this
massive fucking guilt in me.

23:34.080 --> 23:37.520
Cos, obviously, a few things
have gone on in the villa.

23:37.600 --> 23:41.280
If nothing changes, then all we're
doing is going back to square one.

23:41.360 --> 23:42.640
There's just no point.

23:42.720 --> 23:48.040
Seeing you just made me, like,
bring back loads of feelings.

23:48.120 --> 23:52.200
Looking at Charlotte was emotional.
I was happy cos she missed me.

23:52.280 --> 23:55.320
It was a case of absence
makes the heart grow fonder.

23:55.400 --> 23:59.400
I just literally love you so much,
so hopefully we can sort it out.

23:59.480 --> 24:00.920
Aw, this is nice.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.600
What the hell is he gonna do when he
finds out what she's been up to?

24:06.080 --> 24:07.320
'Back at the villa,

24:07.400 --> 24:10.680
Bear is struggling to keep
Little Bear in his pants.'

24:12.640 --> 24:13.760
I know.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.560
Nothing wrong with a bit
of flirty banter, is there? Flanter.

24:32.560 --> 24:35.360
I want a bit of Chrysten,
but it's hard cos I can't.

24:35.440 --> 24:39.120
I can't do that to Lillie, but I
would love to fuck her brains out.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.080
That feels good! Ah.

24:43.120 --> 24:46.920
'Do you know what won't feel good?
An ex with a vendetta

24:47.000 --> 24:51.320
coming straight for the villa.
T minus 12 hours.'

24:58.360 --> 25:02.720
I hope this experience, like,
really does get us back together.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.800
Yeah.
(Tablet rings)

25:04.880 --> 25:07.440
'Looks like your day's
about to get worse.'

25:07.520 --> 25:11.720
"Welcome to the beach, Alex.
The villa is getting too full."

25:12.520 --> 25:16.320
"So, it's decision time.
Who will you throw back in the sea?"

25:17.320 --> 25:18.800
"Alex or Jordan?"

25:18.880 --> 25:20.520
Are you fucking serious?

25:23.280 --> 25:24.320
Jordan is a goner.

25:25.880 --> 25:27.840
I can't do it.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.200
For fuck's sake.

25:29.960 --> 25:33.280
That's brutal.
It's bullshit. Absolute bullshit.

25:36.160 --> 25:39.880
There's no way I can send Alex back
because he's the love of my life

25:39.960 --> 25:43.400
and he's just got here,
so it's just, it's just ridiculous.

25:43.480 --> 25:45.320
You've got stuff to sort, I'll go.

25:45.400 --> 25:47.920
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
It's fine. It's fine.

25:50.760 --> 25:52.080
I'm absolutely gutted.

25:52.160 --> 25:54.680
I love you, too.
But there's not much you can do.

25:55.440 --> 25:57.360
And it's the end of the road.

26:02.800 --> 26:06.120
I'm the fucking king. Look!
That's embarrassing.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.480
I'm back. Hold tight!

26:08.560 --> 26:10.840
He gave me a little boner
in the back.

26:10.920 --> 26:13.160
I have to specify the "little".

26:13.240 --> 26:16.120
Cos slags will start coming.
Of course they will.

26:16.200 --> 26:19.280
These girls won't shake hands,
let alone suck our dicks.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.800
(shouting)

26:20.880 --> 26:22.800
It will come. It will come in time.

26:22.880 --> 26:24.320
Come here. Give me a kiss.

26:26.360 --> 26:30.480
Charlotte, she's really different
to the other girls in the villa.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.960
Simple reason is she sucks dick!

26:33.040 --> 26:36.240
Charlotte's got too pissed
and she's gone to bed early.

26:36.320 --> 26:40.320
It leaves me to swoop in
and crack on with Christine.

26:40.400 --> 26:43.200
Trying to get
another finger on his bedpost.

26:43.280 --> 26:45.800
He thinks he's the dog's
bollocks with birds.

26:52.000 --> 26:54.560
'The Table of Terror
has sent Charlotte and Alex

26:54.640 --> 26:57.240
on a romantic, elegant dinner date.'

26:59.440 --> 27:00.440
Jesus Christ.

27:00.520 --> 27:02.920
My butterflies
are running wild right now.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.440
It was so nice to see you today.

27:05.520 --> 27:07.640
It was nice
seeing the beach as well.

27:07.720 --> 27:12.760
Being with him just feels, like,
amazing and it feels just perfect.

27:12.840 --> 27:16.040
I wanna make an effort
and I want to sort things out

27:16.120 --> 27:20.200
and I wanna prove to you that I do
wanna be with you cos I do.

27:21.680 --> 27:24.680
I just wanna get back with him
and, like, sort things out.

27:25.320 --> 27:27.120
So, what have you been up to?

27:27.200 --> 27:28.560
What, in the villa?
Yeah.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.200
Me and Charlotte are single,

27:30.280 --> 27:33.520
but I'd be fucked off
if she was getting into some lad.

27:33.600 --> 27:36.600
It's been, erm, it's been good,

27:36.680 --> 27:40.240
but, like, erm,
not slept with anyone.

27:40.320 --> 27:41.400
Yeah.

27:45.000 --> 27:47.600
Oh, it's so fucked up.

27:47.680 --> 27:50.200
Erm, obviously things have happened.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.280
What do mean, "things"?

27:52.360 --> 27:54.920
What? I'm just saying
things have happened.

27:55.000 --> 27:56.960
What, kissing and that?
Yeah.

27:57.040 --> 27:58.520
We'll see, won't we?

27:58.600 --> 28:01.000
For this to work,
all I want her to do

28:01.080 --> 28:03.680
is just be more honest
about everything.

28:03.760 --> 28:05.400
There's no need to get angry.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.320
I'm not angry,
but I'm just, like,

28:07.400 --> 28:08.920
you being honest. We'll see.

28:09.000 --> 28:12.480
I can't bring myself to tell Alex
what I've been up to in the villa

28:12.560 --> 28:16.280
because it's not the right time
and I just don't wanna fuck it up.

28:16.360 --> 28:18.080
I wanna try and make it up to you

28:18.160 --> 28:21.320
and prove to you that I do want
something to happen between us

28:21.400 --> 28:24.400
because I feel like
we are meant to be with each other.

28:24.480 --> 28:26.680
I actually do.
Yeah.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.760
I don't wanna throw away
six years, at the end of the day.

28:30.440 --> 28:33.400
Neither do I.
At all. It's a massive waste.

28:33.480 --> 28:37.280
I would like to trust Charlotte,
but Charlotte lies all the time.

28:37.360 --> 28:41.000
She's adamant she's not slept with
anybody. The truth will come out.

28:41.080 --> 28:44.000
So, for Charlotte to lie,
she'd be a fucking idiot.

28:44.080 --> 28:46.160
Can I have a kiss?
One kiss.

28:47.080 --> 28:49.120
Come here. Come here, you.

28:58.680 --> 29:00.640
I think he said he was more nervous.

29:00.720 --> 29:02.520
Oh! Jemma!

29:02.600 --> 29:04.720
Why is there just one of you?

29:04.800 --> 29:07.840
Jemma's walked in by herself.
What the fuck is going on?

29:07.920 --> 29:10.520
What happened?
Charlotte's ex arrived.

29:10.600 --> 29:13.560
Everything's going well.
The Tablet goes off.

29:14.680 --> 29:16.240
Someone's had to go.
Fuck.

29:16.320 --> 29:18.120
No fucking way.

29:19.480 --> 29:21.800
Oh, my God.

29:21.880 --> 29:26.600
Jordan's gone? I am shocked.

29:27.880 --> 29:30.920
The Tablet of Terror has just
swooped the king of swoops.

29:31.000 --> 29:32.520
Fucking madness.

29:32.600 --> 29:36.520
Telling you now, anything can happen,
but none of us are fucking safe.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.640
'After losing an all-star original,

29:45.720 --> 29:47.920
the thing to do is play dress-up.'

29:49.720 --> 29:52.160
You all right, love?
I'm Charlotte Dawson.

29:52.240 --> 29:54.360
Lovely to meet you.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.280
(laughter)

29:56.360 --> 29:59.000
I'll be giving Olivia
the parsnip tonight.

29:59.840 --> 30:03.480
Hun! Hun! I'm Holly.

30:03.560 --> 30:06.840
What the fuck are you doing?
Easy as that.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.920
You've slept with half of London.
What are you doing?

30:10.000 --> 30:11.320
(laughs)

30:14.160 --> 30:16.800
Why would you say that,
you fucking bell-end?

30:16.880 --> 30:18.920
Who wants a Cain?
(laughter)

30:20.520 --> 30:22.320
Yeah!

30:24.760 --> 30:28.160
I'm honestly having probably
the best night I've had in here.

30:31.360 --> 30:32.600
Her fanny's out!

30:34.360 --> 30:37.200
Oh, my God, like,
I just love being in Jemma's shadow.

30:37.280 --> 30:38.600
(laughs)

30:38.680 --> 30:41.240
I'd love a fucking drink right now.

30:46.040 --> 30:48.160
I love sex!

30:48.240 --> 30:52.440
It doesn't matter if it's
a boy or a girl. I just love sex.

30:52.520 --> 30:54.240
I am sick of all this shit.

30:54.320 --> 30:57.480
Every single night, someone's
got beef, usually with me.

30:57.560 --> 31:01.120
By the way, Holly, you've had more
dick than me in here.

31:01.200 --> 31:03.240
You've had three. I've had two.

31:03.320 --> 31:04.640
Jemma, it's a game.

31:04.720 --> 31:08.320
We're taking the piss.
Some people are getting offended.

31:08.400 --> 31:10.160
Like, it's a game.

31:11.920 --> 31:14.360
I decided to act out the time
I was with Gaz

31:14.440 --> 31:17.400
and he told me to be quiet
while he was talking to Lillie.

31:17.480 --> 31:18.840
Ring, ring. Awkward.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.960
Ring, ring, ring, ring.
Hello?

31:21.040 --> 31:23.920
Hey, babe, I miss you so much.
Hi, babe, I miss you too.

31:24.000 --> 31:27.040
I'm just finishing my PA meeting.
I'll be home soon.

31:27.120 --> 31:28.840
Can't to see you. Love you.
Bye.

31:29.920 --> 31:33.640
Oh, my fucking God. This is awkward.

31:33.720 --> 31:35.680
(laughter)

31:35.760 --> 31:37.680
Gaz's face is an absolute picture.

31:37.760 --> 31:41.200
It's gone from funny to intense
real fucking quickly.

31:41.280 --> 31:44.040
(group shrieks)

31:44.120 --> 31:47.120
Half of me feels like,
play along, Lillie.

31:47.200 --> 31:48.280
Have the last laugh.

31:48.360 --> 31:50.720
But the other half of me
is killing inside

31:50.800 --> 31:53.880
cos I'm re-enacting a situation

31:53.960 --> 31:56.680
where the person I loved
cheated on me.

31:56.760 --> 31:59.440
Allo! I'm Australian!

31:59.520 --> 32:03.920
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

32:04.000 --> 32:06.400
Me, I'm a method actor

32:06.480 --> 32:09.040
and I take my role very seriously.

32:09.120 --> 32:12.360
Who's seen Gaz anywhere? Gaz?
Where's Gaz?

32:12.440 --> 32:14.960
Gaz? Oh, Gaz you are...
Oh, my G...

32:15.040 --> 32:16.480
Oh!

32:16.560 --> 32:18.920
Mmm, your cock's so big. Gaz
Oh, my God!

32:19.560 --> 32:21.400
Bear's started snogging Chrysten

32:21.480 --> 32:24.720
and he's using it as an excuse
cos he's got a costume on.

32:24.800 --> 32:27.200
But I know Bear
and he likes Chrysten.

32:27.880 --> 32:30.840
I'm just so confused about Bear.

32:30.920 --> 32:32.880
Bear tells me he's got trust issues

32:32.960 --> 32:35.680
and that's why he does
the weird things he does.

32:35.760 --> 32:39.640
But does he not think after what
Gary's done, I've got trust issues?

32:39.720 --> 32:42.280
And now I don't know
whether to trust Bear.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.640
'Trusting Bear won't be
your only concern, Lillie,

32:45.720 --> 32:49.320
not when there's a line of exes
waiting to make their entrance.'

32:49.400 --> 32:51.960
'Whose ex is next?'

32:54.200 --> 32:56.800
'After convincing Alex
she's a new woman,

32:56.880 --> 32:58.680
Charlotte's hoping a loud scream

32:58.760 --> 33:01.440
will distract the others
from telling the truth.'

33:01.520 --> 33:02.520
You all right?

33:02.600 --> 33:07.600
Oh, my God! So, why the fuck
is Ashley dressed like me

33:07.680 --> 33:09.160
and what's been going on?

33:09.240 --> 33:10.600
First, I look fabulous.

33:10.680 --> 33:13.560
Basically, we had to dress up
as other people tonight.

33:14.560 --> 33:18.320
I picked you cos you're the most
extravagant motherfucker in here.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.920
I did the best impression.
I was the headliner.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.880
Obviously, you know what I mean?
You're dressed as me.

33:23.960 --> 33:26.240
How was the date?
We had a really good date.

33:26.320 --> 33:29.160
Like, as soon as I saw him,
I just burst into tears.

33:29.240 --> 33:32.520
It's the sort of effect I have
on people. They start crying.

33:32.600 --> 33:35.960
In a bad way, I think. But, no,
it was all right. It was good.

33:36.040 --> 33:38.880
I think we want to rekindle.
Well, I do anyway.

33:38.960 --> 33:42.400
Oh, Alex, really, mate?
You wanna be Charlotte's boyfriend?

33:42.480 --> 33:43.520
Are you sure?

33:43.600 --> 33:46.000
But she gets about.
I'll leave it like that.

33:46.080 --> 33:47.760
We'll just see what happens.

33:52.040 --> 33:54.680
It's all fun and games
until the truth comes out.

33:55.680 --> 33:57.960
'While Charlotte's secrets
are safe now,

33:58.040 --> 34:01.320
Holly is causing a few problems.'

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
I do like Holly.
We have good banter.

34:13.679 --> 34:15.840
It's just, after that drink or two,

34:15.920 --> 34:19.080
it goes fucking pear-shaped.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.040
Don't shout at me!

34:26.440 --> 34:29.600
"Oh, well your fanny was out.
I don't wanna see your fanny."

34:29.679 --> 34:32.480
Babe, who the fuck wears knickers?

34:35.560 --> 34:39.040
I don't wanna be associated when
she's running with her minge out.

34:39.120 --> 34:43.199
It's disgusting. It's horrible. Who
wants to be seen with that? Not me.

34:46.600 --> 34:50.600
I look. I see her and Conor
kicking off. Let's see what happens.

35:00.840 --> 35:02.880
Holly, shut the fuck up.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.920
Button it. You're pissing me off.

35:08.320 --> 35:11.160
Do you know what's pissing me off?
Is he is like,

35:11.240 --> 35:14.640
"Oh, fuck off. You got your
fanny out. You're embarrassing."

35:14.720 --> 35:18.800
"Oh, go put fucking knickers on,
you slag."

35:18.880 --> 35:20.600
I hate him.

35:20.680 --> 35:24.120
Fucking hate that silly,
little, stupid cunt!

35:30.640 --> 35:33.560
So, I'm gonna take my chance.
Give me some action.

35:36.960 --> 35:37.960
No.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.080
Right now, I hate Conor, so I'd
rather get with Hawley over him.

35:48.160 --> 35:50.040
(laughs) Hawley, no.

36:07.920 --> 36:11.160
Jemma's fuming.
Something's gonna kick off.

36:16.440 --> 36:19.760
I've been holding my rage in
all fucking day

36:19.840 --> 36:22.920
because Kayleigh lost her shit
for no fucking reason.

36:23.000 --> 36:26.080
I'd rather look like this
than like you, to be fair.

36:26.160 --> 36:29.040
You're dissing me.
I'm Hawley, like...

36:29.120 --> 36:32.120
I'm talking about the real you.
Did you just say that?

36:32.200 --> 36:35.720
Oh, you wanna talk about
the real people, yeah?

36:35.800 --> 36:37.680
Round two, bitch. It's coming up.

36:37.760 --> 36:41.480
Get my fucking makeup out of that
pool cos my fucking make-up...

36:41.560 --> 36:43.640
Oy! Oy! Oy! Oy!

36:43.720 --> 36:46.440
This villa is mental.
What the fuck is happening?

36:46.520 --> 36:47.760
Oy!
Fuck you!

36:47.840 --> 36:50.480
What the fuck?
You stupid skank!

36:50.560 --> 36:52.920
Get the fuck away from me.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.960
You come on, then!
Bring it! Bring it!

36:56.040 --> 36:59.760
I fucking dare you.
I fucking dare you.

36:59.840 --> 37:01.320
I ain't taking no shit.

37:01.400 --> 37:05.120
Unhand me. You stupid fucking bitch!

37:05.200 --> 37:06.280
I hate her.

37:06.360 --> 37:08.560
You fucking slut!

37:08.640 --> 37:10.720
I saw red.

37:10.800 --> 37:12.640
If I see red,
what am I gonna do?

37:12.720 --> 37:15.960
Tip-toe and dance around?
No, I'm gonna fucking come for you.

37:16.040 --> 37:19.400
You STI'd fucking slut!

37:19.480 --> 37:20.480
You fucking cunt!

37:20.560 --> 37:23.120
I'm having a chuffing night, like.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.720
Until everybody
started fucking me off

37:25.800 --> 37:29.480
and now I'm Ashley Cain. If you're
not gonna have fun, get out of here.

37:29.560 --> 37:31.200
I will fuck you up!

37:31.280 --> 37:35.600
Will you? That's twice you haven't.
That's twice you fucking haven't.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.360
I ain't fucking having it!
It's a fucking fact.

37:38.440 --> 37:39.920
Calm down.

37:40.000 --> 37:43.000
Get me out of here.
Get me the fuck out of here.

37:44.240 --> 37:45.520
'With one blow too many,

37:45.600 --> 37:47.800
it's time for Jemma
to leave the Villa.'

37:51.960 --> 37:53.440
She's fit, man. Shit.

37:53.520 --> 37:56.400
I'm a new Jemma and blondes
definitely have more fun.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.280
Gaz, show me the penthouse.

37:58.360 --> 38:01.320
(moaning)

38:07.000 --> 38:09.920
He made me cum eight times,
which has never happened.

38:12.120 --> 38:13.920
Fucking say it to me, then.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.040
You look like a used condom.
Do I?

38:16.120 --> 38:17.800
You look like a used condom.

38:17.880 --> 38:19.640
Are you off your head?

38:19.720 --> 38:20.880
Are you joking?

38:20.960 --> 38:23.280
Oy, stop it! Oy!
Fucking joking?

38:24.640 --> 38:26.160
What's happening, Jemma?

38:27.240 --> 38:29.680
The person that is
the love of my life is here.

38:29.760 --> 38:33.000
You fucked me up, Hawley.
Do you know how much that hurt me?

38:33.080 --> 38:34.280
You broke my heart.

38:34.360 --> 38:37.280
I wanted to build bridges with you,
which I was gonna do.

38:37.360 --> 38:40.000
As soon as I got here,
youse two fucked each other.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.960
(indistinct)

38:43.040 --> 38:45.640
Hey! Stop. Stop.
(indistinct)

38:45.720 --> 38:48.480
Gonna go on a date with Holly
and fuck over Jemma.

38:48.560 --> 38:49.920
I fucking hate it.

38:50.000 --> 38:52.240
His face is in her pussy, yeah?

38:52.320 --> 38:53.840
Are you mad?!

38:55.560 --> 38:57.680
Right, who wants to finger me?

38:57.760 --> 39:00.840
The prick that is Hawley
is trying to get revenge

39:00.920 --> 39:02.280
with some skank!

39:02.760 --> 39:04.760
(shouting)

39:06.280 --> 39:09.080
I did not think
I was gonna feel like this.

39:10.680 --> 39:12.840
I don't think I've been this upset.

39:17.880 --> 39:18.080
