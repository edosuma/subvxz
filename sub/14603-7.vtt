- so don't look at me.
- How would you even do that?

04:50.835 --> 04:53.836

05:49.093 --> 05:50.893
who thought it meant
more than it did.

that's such a good idea.

06:36.140 --> 06:37.273
Why not?

06:37.275 --> 06:38.607
Mainly because Dorrit
would never go for it

I think the universe

Hooch. For the dance.

Funny, I would've have
pegged Walt

07:48.929 --> 07:50.629

07:50.631 --> 07:51.880
Oh, I can drink a bottle of this
by myself.

07:51.882 --> 07:53.682
You didn't bring anything
for Walt?

07:53.684 --> 07:55.167
I brought scotch for my man.

07:55.169 --> 07:56.852
Not that it's any of your buisness but
Walt's sick.

07:56.854 --> 07:58.003
Chicken pox.

07:58.005 --> 07:59.271
Oh, so you're not going
to the dance?

07:59.273 --> 08:00.839
- No, I'm going.
- Really?

08:00.841 --> 08:02.441
Isn't it a little tragic
to go alone

08:02.443 --> 08:04.310
and not have your boyfriend
to grind against?

08:04.312 --> 08:07.012
No. What's tragic is
someone who <i>can't</i> be alone.

08:07.014 --> 08:08.364
I don't have that problem.

08:08.366 --> 08:09.515
Me, either, but I'm <i>me.</i>

08:09.517 --> 08:11.350
I'm always the best thing
in the room.

08:11.352 --> 08:14.403
Without a hot guy like Walt,
you're just positively average.

08:14.405 --> 08:16.789
When you see me on the dance
floor, you will take that back.

08:16.791 --> 08:19.274
(Laughs) Oh.
That's so pathetic.

08:19.276 --> 08:20.376
I can already see you

08:20.378 --> 08:21.710
dancing with
your sad little girlfriends.

08:21.712 --> 08:23.012
I know they won't have dates
either.

08:23.014 --> 08:25.831
Actually, they do. Hot ones.

08:25.833 --> 08:27.166
They both have boyfriends.

08:27.168 --> 08:28.467
Good. (Laughs)

08:28.469 --> 08:30.202
Then I guess that means
I won't have to watch Carrie

08:30.204 --> 08:32.054
be all mopey while
she watches Sebastian and I

08:32.056 --> 08:34.923
burn it slow on the dance floor

08:34.924 --> 08:37.208
(laughs) Bye!
See ya at the dance.

08:41.815 --> 08:43.932
♪

08:43.933 --> 08:46.185
This is so cool.

08:46.187 --> 08:48.220
So all of these make up
the new issue of "Interview"?

08:48.222 --> 08:49.521
That's right.

08:49.523 --> 08:51.023
I'm just making final approvals
before going to press.

08:51.025 --> 08:54.026
I wish I could actually see
where you come up with all this.

08:54.028 --> 08:55.361
I imagine
the "Interview" offices

08:55.363 --> 08:58.614
are less like work and more like
a giant playground.

08:58.616 --> 09:00.532
Genius.

09:00.534 --> 09:01.617
What?

09:01.619 --> 09:03.535
You have just saved me!

09:03.537 --> 09:04.620
From what?

09:04.622 --> 09:06.405
I've been racking my brain,

09:06.407 --> 09:08.874
trying to come up with a theme
for my next photo shoot.

09:08.876 --> 09:12.244
Christian Lacroix did
adult onesies for next season.

09:12.246 --> 09:13.462
They're divine,

09:13.464 --> 09:15.914
and I can shoot them on
an adult-sized playground.

09:15.916 --> 09:18.016
The models can have dummies!
Oh! (Laughs)

09:18.018 --> 09:20.585
Dummies? Do... do you mean
like mannequins?

09:20.587 --> 09:23.588
No. Like those stoppers you put
into wailing babies' mouths.

09:23.590 --> 09:25.524
Oh. Pacifiers.

09:25.526 --> 09:27.309
Exactly. You're <i>brazilliant.</i>

09:27.311 --> 09:30.946
And now for the grand finale...

09:30.948 --> 09:33.065
(Gasps)

09:33.067 --> 09:34.950
No way! My purse!

09:34.952 --> 09:36.101
Leaps off the page, doesn't it?

09:36.103 --> 09:39.538
Oh! "Painted purse
makes a big splash."

09:39.540 --> 09:43.125
Eh. Could use some work.
Like I said, still approving.

09:43.127 --> 09:46.128
Well, what about something
more like, um...

09:46.130 --> 09:47.946
Uh...

09:47.948 --> 09:49.448
"A pollock for your purse...

09:49.450 --> 09:52.718
"This fun, splattered look
will soon be splattered

09:52.720 --> 09:53.919
all over New York City."

09:53.921 --> 09:56.422
A pollock reference?

09:56.424 --> 09:57.723
That is fabulous.

09:57.725 --> 09:59.675
You have got a real knack
for this, Carrie Bradshaw.

09:59.677 --> 10:02.261
Ya think?
Maybe writing is your calling.

10:02.263 --> 10:03.846
I don't know.

10:03.848 --> 10:06.148
I mean, sure, I like to write,
but it's really just a hobby.

10:06.150 --> 10:07.266
I'm no Judy Blume.

10:07.268 --> 10:09.268
Come and work for me
at "Interview."

10:09.270 --> 10:10.652
Excuse me?

10:10.654 --> 10:11.803
You would fit right in.

10:11.805 --> 10:13.939
First, you come up
with this brilliant purse,

10:13.941 --> 10:16.975
and then spice it up with
an equally brilliant caption.

10:16.977 --> 10:18.277
You inspired
my next photo shoot.

10:18.279 --> 10:21.146
- You would be fantastic.
- Oh.

10:21.148 --> 10:24.750
<i>Not only was I caught between</i>
<i>two guys, but two worlds...</i>

10:24.752 --> 10:29.254
<i>The law firm</i>
<i>and "Interview" magazine.</i>

10:31.943 --> 10:34.592
She offered you an internship
at "Interview" magazine?

10:34.594 --> 10:35.843
It's kind of a dream, right?

10:35.845 --> 10:38.195
Duh! Think of all the parties
you'll get to go to

10:38.197 --> 10:39.430
and all the celebrities
you'll get to meet

10:39.432 --> 10:41.148
and all the clothes
you'll get to wear.

10:41.150 --> 10:43.417
Except... I don't know
if I can take the job.

10:43.419 --> 10:44.602
What? Are you crazy?

10:44.604 --> 10:47.087
You are this close
to meeting Ralph Macchio.

10:47.089 --> 10:48.489
In case you've forgotten,
I'm 16.

10:48.491 --> 10:49.523
I have not forgotten.

10:49.525 --> 10:50.975
Well, Larissa has no idea.

10:50.977 --> 10:53.060
She thinks I'm a grownup
who works at a law firm

10:53.062 --> 10:54.295
and pays rent.

10:54.297 --> 10:55.896
She hasn't figured it out yet.

10:55.898 --> 10:57.481
You could pull this off.

10:57.483 --> 10:59.533
I thought maybe I could
work at "Interview"

10:59.535 --> 11:02.236
instead of the law firm
the one day a week I go there,

11:02.238 --> 11:03.371
but I don't know.

11:03.373 --> 11:05.606
I'd feel so awful
abandoning that job.

11:05.608 --> 11:08.376
Carrie, that internship is
a snooze-fest.

11:08.378 --> 11:09.744
In fact, I just fell asleep
saying that.

11:09.746 --> 11:11.662
But my dad got me the job.

11:11.664 --> 11:13.831
And he'd be so disappointed
if I quit.

11:13.833 --> 11:15.282
(Door bells jingle) I'm telling
you, this will all be forgiven

11:15.284 --> 11:17.501
when you meet the karate kid.

11:17.503 --> 11:18.586
(Smack)

11:18.588 --> 11:20.471
(Bag thuds) My life is ruined.

11:20.473 --> 11:21.889
A B-Plus?

11:21.891 --> 11:23.758
In my house, that would get
a standing ovation.

11:23.760 --> 11:25.509
I've never gotten below
an A-Plus.

11:25.511 --> 11:27.762
Do you know what happened?
Did you study?

11:27.764 --> 11:29.963
Of course I studied.
I'm always studying.

11:29.965 --> 11:31.732
In fact, I studied for this exam
all last weekend

11:31.734 --> 11:33.801
while I was visiting Seth
at school.

11:33.803 --> 11:38.105
(Seth panting) (Mouse laughing)

11:38.107 --> 11:39.690
I can't believe it.

11:39.692 --> 11:41.776
And to think, I was attacking
Bitchy Barbara

11:41.778 --> 11:43.911
for letting a man
take priority over her job.

11:43.913 --> 11:47.281
Meanwhile, I let Seth
take priority over mine,

11:47.283 --> 11:48.265
which is to get good grades!

11:48.267 --> 11:50.735
It makes sense in a way.

11:50.737 --> 11:52.319
Sex can make a person
do crazy things.

11:52.321 --> 11:53.587
I guess you would know.

11:53.589 --> 11:55.506
You and Walt have
the craziest sex of anyone.

11:55.508 --> 11:56.791
(Laughs) Well...

11:56.793 --> 11:58.826
Not exactly.

11:58.828 --> 12:00.711
Oh, please tell me
you do not expect Walt

12:00.713 --> 12:03.163
to do it with you
when he has the chicken pox.

12:03.165 --> 12:04.498
No, of course not.

12:04.500 --> 12:07.218
No, even before this,
it was just...

12:07.220 --> 12:08.803
Well...

12:08.805 --> 12:10.671
Less than... happening.

12:10.673 --> 12:12.890
We seem to have had a drop-off.
Is that normal?

12:12.892 --> 12:14.141
Don't ask me.

12:14.143 --> 12:17.061
I just destroyed my entire life
for sex.

12:17.063 --> 12:19.280
Well, don't ask me.
I haven't had it at all.

12:19.282 --> 12:22.149
Well, that could change
if you take George to the dance.

12:22.151 --> 12:23.984
We need to spend less time
thinking about guys

12:23.986 --> 12:25.953
and focus more
on our paths in life.

12:25.955 --> 12:28.205
Actually, Carrie might have
a new path.

12:28.207 --> 12:29.907
Larissa offered her
an internship

12:29.909 --> 12:31.024
at "Interview" magazine.

12:31.026 --> 12:33.077
That madwoman in heels?
(Door bell jingles)

12:33.079 --> 12:35.045
What does your dad have to say
about this?

12:35.047 --> 12:36.864
Uh, I haven't told him.

12:36.866 --> 12:38.299
I'm kind of stalling.

12:38.301 --> 12:41.368
Carrie, didn't he get you
the job at the law firm?

12:41.370 --> 12:42.703
Yeah.

12:42.705 --> 12:44.204
Oh, my God.

12:44.206 --> 12:46.841
My parents would kill me if they
got me that, and I bailed on it.

12:46.843 --> 12:48.559
Please.
Who cares what parents say?

12:48.561 --> 12:49.760
I don't, in case
you were wondering.

12:49.762 --> 12:50.978
And you shouldn't either.

12:50.980 --> 12:52.980
- So I shouldn't talk to him?
- No! Just do it.

12:52.982 --> 12:54.548
He doesn't know what you do
once you're in the city.

12:54.550 --> 12:56.517
But I think of my dad
as someone I <i>can</i> talk to,

12:56.519 --> 12:57.735
someone I can trust.

12:57.737 --> 12:59.570
I mean, he's not
like a friend exactly,

12:59.572 --> 13:02.740
but he's certainly
more than just a dad.

13:02.742 --> 13:04.024
I have no idea what you mean.

13:04.026 --> 13:05.225
The only time my dad and I talk

13:05.227 --> 13:06.494
is when he says
"pass the salt."

13:06.496 --> 13:09.563
Carrie, dads are scary.
That's their job.

13:09.565 --> 13:10.748
Mine is probably
going to crush me

13:10.750 --> 13:12.700
when he finds out about
this grade.

13:12.702 --> 13:14.919
(Sighs) You're lucky you have
the dad you do.

13:14.921 --> 13:16.337
Trust me, I know.

13:16.339 --> 13:18.572
I'm just saying, at some point,

13:18.574 --> 13:20.007
you'll have to
make decisions for yourself.

13:20.009 --> 13:21.959
Well, something this big,
you need to consult a parent.

13:21.961 --> 13:23.594
(Groans)
I don't know what to do.

13:23.596 --> 13:26.096
I know that part of growing up
is making my own choices,

13:26.098 --> 13:27.381
but I also think

13:27.383 --> 13:29.633
my dad would have
a good perspective on all this.

13:29.635 --> 13:30.768
Take the job.

13:30.770 --> 13:32.353
Talk you your dad.

13:32.355 --> 13:36.223
<i>Now I wasn't just caught</i>
<i>between two jobs and two guys,</i>

13:36.225 --> 13:38.609
<i>but between</i>
<i>two friends' opinions.</i>

13:38.611 --> 13:41.529
<i>I wasn't so ready</i>
<i>to deal with any of it,</i>

13:41.531 --> 13:43.898
<i>except suddenly</i>
<i>i had no choice.</i>

13:43.900 --> 13:45.733
Hey, comrade.
Mind if I fall in?

13:45.735 --> 13:47.067
Please do.

13:47.069 --> 13:50.037
After all, it doesn't seem
anyone minds if we hang out.

13:50.039 --> 13:51.438
What do you mean?

13:51.440 --> 13:52.706
Oh, nothing.

13:52.708 --> 13:54.658
I was just surprised
Donna knew about Thanksgiving,

13:54.660 --> 13:58.295
and that she seemed so cool
about it.

13:58.297 --> 14:01.114
I mean, not that there was
anything <i>not</i> cool about it.

14:01.116 --> 14:03.784
Donna didn't have any reason
to worry.

14:03.786 --> 14:05.118
Uh, it was only
Thanksgiving dinner.

14:05.120 --> 14:06.720
And since we didn't even
have a turkey,

14:06.722 --> 14:08.055
there was barely a dinner
at all.

14:08.057 --> 14:09.223
I told Donna
because I didn't want

14:09.225 --> 14:10.624
to put you in
an awkward position.

14:10.626 --> 14:11.959
Awkward?
What... what could be awkward?

14:11.961 --> 14:13.126
There's nothing awkward.

14:13.128 --> 14:14.311
Oh, I just didn't
want you to feel like

14:14.313 --> 14:15.763
you were part of a lie.

14:15.765 --> 14:17.297
You know, with all your friends
there, it felt kinda weird.

14:17.299 --> 14:19.984
No. No weird at all.
There was no weirdness.

14:19.986 --> 14:21.635
Donna did actually seem
pretty okay with it.

14:21.637 --> 14:22.903
With Donna, you never know.

14:22.905 --> 14:24.238
You only see what
she wants you to see.

14:24.240 --> 14:26.523
I wish I could hide
what I'm feeling.

14:26.525 --> 14:28.909
I just say everything
that comes into my head.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.945
The words just tumble out
like clowns from a clown car.

14:30.947 --> 14:32.780
(Scoffs)
Look, I'm doing it now.

14:32.782 --> 14:34.531
I should probably learn
to just keep quiet.

14:34.533 --> 14:36.016
No, let the clowns do
their thing.

14:36.018 --> 14:38.335
I like how everything with you
is out in the open.

14:38.337 --> 14:40.254
I think it's cute,
you spinning out to control,

14:40.256 --> 14:42.656
wondering if I'm telling people
about Thanksgiving.

14:42.658 --> 14:45.709
(Laughs) That's me.
Just send in the clowns!

14:45.711 --> 14:48.012
All right. Well, I'll see you
at the dance, all right?

14:48.014 --> 14:49.630
You bet you will.

14:49.632 --> 14:50.965
I will be there.

14:52.467 --> 14:56.136
<i>There was no way I was going</i>
<i>to the dance empty-handed,</i>

14:56.138 --> 14:59.106
<i>so I decided to fill up my</i>
<i>dance card with George Silver.</i>

14:59.108 --> 15:00.774
(Coin clinks)

15:04.396 --> 15:05.846
George, it's me.

15:05.848 --> 15:06.997
(Crickets chirping)

15:06.999 --> 15:08.649
So... I wanted
to talk to you

15:08.651 --> 15:10.517
about my internship
at the law firm.

15:10.519 --> 15:11.819
Is everything all right?

15:11.821 --> 15:14.188
Did something go wrong
at the firm?

15:14.190 --> 15:15.489
Well...

15:15.491 --> 15:17.190
You know, a lot of work
went into getting you this job.

15:17.192 --> 15:18.208
We can't mess this up.

15:18.210 --> 15:20.694
You are extremely lucky
to have it.

15:20.696 --> 15:22.379
The firm had never let
a high schooler work there

15:22.381 --> 15:23.697
before you.

15:23.699 --> 15:25.582
And your school wasn't
so sure about it either.

15:25.584 --> 15:28.502
- They weren't?
- They keep asking

15:28.504 --> 15:30.471
how they would know that
you were doing the work.

15:30.473 --> 15:31.755
You know, worried about

15:31.757 --> 15:33.257
how many days of school
you'd have to miss.

15:33.259 --> 15:34.858
Finally, I was able
to get them to agree

15:34.860 --> 15:36.610
after everything
you'd been through.

15:36.612 --> 15:38.212
(Sighs)

15:38.214 --> 15:40.547
I didn't realize.

15:40.549 --> 15:41.865
Thanks, dad.

15:43.217 --> 15:44.718
Mm.

15:44.720 --> 15:48.489
<i>For once, I kept what I was</i>
<i>really feeling to myself.</i>

15:48.491 --> 15:49.606
That's awesome.

15:49.608 --> 15:51.275
And I feel really lucky.

15:51.277 --> 15:54.061
I met George as a result,
so... that's a huge bonus.

15:54.063 --> 15:56.080
Great.
That's wonderful, kiddo.

15:56.082 --> 15:57.564
So what did you want
to talk to me about?

16:00.234 --> 16:01.919
Um...

16:01.921 --> 16:05.189
I wanted to know
how you became a lawyer.

16:05.191 --> 16:09.593
Did you ever think
of any other careers?

16:09.595 --> 16:11.378
No. Never.

16:11.380 --> 16:13.047
No, I always wanted to do this.

16:13.049 --> 16:14.598
What Harlan does
is more corporate.

16:14.600 --> 16:17.101
What I do
is more person to person.

16:17.103 --> 16:18.385
I get to help people.

16:18.387 --> 16:20.754
You know, like what I did
for your friend Sebastian.

16:20.756 --> 16:23.223
Hmm. Right. That.

16:23.225 --> 16:25.976
(Chuckles)
And you were right, Carrie.

16:25.978 --> 16:27.444
I was very impressed with him
at Thanksgiving.

16:27.446 --> 16:31.115
He seems like a decent kid.
Just made a mistake.

No. It just means you get

37:33.472 --> 37:36.607
and what it takes to get there.

37:36.609 --> 37:40.377
Getting good grades and staying
on path is who we are.

37:40.379 --> 37:42.146
But maybe
there's a way around it.

37:42.148 --> 37:43.981
You know, what if we made
a kind of contract?

37:43.983 --> 37:45.733
You know, set aside
"X" number of hours?

37:45.735 --> 37:48.652
This isn't who I really am.
It's gotten out of control.

37:48.654 --> 37:50.254
I almost got suspended.

37:50.256 --> 37:52.156
I see your point.

37:55.243 --> 37:56.994
(Kisses)

37:58.947 --> 38:00.364
<i>Mouse knew</i>

38:00.366 --> 38:04.868
<i>in order for her and Seth</i>
<i>to be who they truly were,</i>

38:04.870 --> 38:07.504
<i>they would need to let go</i>
<i>of each other.</i>

38:10.241 --> 38:11.575
I can't believe

38:11.577 --> 38:13.961
you've been carrying
all this around for so long.

38:13.963 --> 38:16.263
So you don't hate me?

38:16.265 --> 38:18.499
Sweetie, I'm not here
to judge you.

38:18.501 --> 38:20.642
But I do feel awful for Walt.

38:20.762 --> 38:22.886
I mean, you cheated on him.

38:22.888 --> 38:25.272
I know.

38:25.274 --> 38:26.590
(Sighs)

38:26.592 --> 38:29.143
Obviously, something deeper
is going on for you.

38:29.145 --> 38:30.794
What is it?

38:30.796 --> 38:32.529
I don't know. I...

38:32.531 --> 38:34.365
I mean, I love Walt

38:34.367 --> 38:36.567
despite what I've done.
But it just...

38:36.569 --> 38:40.621
It feels like something
isn't working between us.

38:40.623 --> 38:42.122
I can't quite put my finger
on it,

38:42.124 --> 38:43.957
but it feels like it's me.

38:43.959 --> 38:45.442
You can't beat yourself up.

38:45.444 --> 38:48.945
But I do think you and Walt
need to deal with this.

38:48.947 --> 38:49.997
Talk to each other.

38:49.999 --> 38:52.616
What if he never
speaks to me again?

38:52.618 --> 38:53.834
I guess I deserve that.

38:53.836 --> 38:56.587
He needs to hear it from you,

38:56.589 --> 38:57.755
not Donna.

38:57.757 --> 38:59.506
Oh, yeah. You're right.

39:00.925 --> 39:03.127
On the brighside,
Sebastian must really like you.

39:03.129 --> 39:04.345
(Scoffs)

39:04.347 --> 39:05.646
Donna's like a cornered cat.

39:05.648 --> 39:08.599
Ah, who knows?
That Sebastian's a tricky one.

39:08.601 --> 39:11.485
And I don't want to get
caught up in all the drama.

39:11.487 --> 39:13.721
I've created enough of my own.

39:13.723 --> 39:14.822
(Exhales)

39:14.824 --> 39:16.490
Maybe we should
just forget about boys.

39:16.492 --> 39:19.443
Ha! Totally.

39:19.445 --> 39:22.830
But even in other parts
of my life, I can't escape it.

39:22.832 --> 39:26.533
I feel like I've created this
whole fantasy inside my head

39:26.535 --> 39:30.153
about how I could work
at "Interview."

39:30.155 --> 39:33.173
Ohh. I mean,
what was I thinking?

39:33.175 --> 39:36.159
I-I can't leave the law firm.

39:36.161 --> 39:37.845
My dad would be crushed.

39:37.847 --> 39:39.380
But you really want
"Interview."

39:39.382 --> 39:42.165
Don't lose this chance.
You'll totally regret it.

39:42.167 --> 39:45.302
