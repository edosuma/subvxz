WEBVTT

00:01.586 --> 00:05.382
Phew! Wow. It is raining
cats and dogs out there.

00:05.840 --> 00:07.217
Holy moly!

00:07.300 --> 00:10.553
Phyllis says the same 12
clichÃ©s every time it rains.

00:10.637 --> 00:14.557
So, I promised everyone that if
she says them all by noon today,

00:14.641 --> 00:17.102
I will send out
for hot chocolates.

00:17.477 --> 00:18.603
So how was the drive in?

00:18.728 --> 00:20.522
Nobody knows how to
drive in the rain.

00:20.605 --> 00:21.940
You don't say?
Yeah.

00:22.065 --> 00:25.443
You know the roads are actually the
slickest in the first half hour?

00:26.903 --> 00:29.989
- I think it's the oil, it comes to the surface.
- I agree.

00:30.949 --> 00:34.536
Ooh! The plants are gonna love this.
Yeah.

00:39.666 --> 00:42.043
I actually sleep
better when it's raining.

00:42.127 --> 00:43.294
Tell me about it.

00:43.712 --> 00:46.381
Time's almost up. How many are left?
Just one.

00:46.464 --> 00:49.467
"This weather makes me want to stay
at home, curled up with a good book."

00:51.302 --> 00:55.098
Phyllis, this rain, does it make
you want to be doing something?

00:55.306 --> 00:56.766
What do you mean?

00:56.850 --> 01:00.353
You know, like, aren't some things
just so nice and cozy in the rain?

01:00.437 --> 01:03.022
Hey, come on. Lots of things
are cozy in the rain.

01:04.649 --> 01:06.735
And that's noon.
Exactly!

01:07.819 --> 01:09.571
Sorry about that,
everybody.

01:10.822 --> 01:12.949
Hey, Phyllis, would you
like a hot chocolate?

01:13.032 --> 01:14.075
Ooh, I'd love one.

01:14.159 --> 01:16.661
I'm going out to get
two hot chocolates.

01:20.915 --> 01:23.209
I mean, normally the rain would
make me want to stay at home,

01:23.293 --> 01:24.627
curled up with
a good book,

01:24.711 --> 01:27.213
but everybody's being
so nice to me today.

01:27.297 --> 01:28.840
I'm really happy
being here.

01:53.656 --> 01:56.951
My girlfriend's back and
there's going to be trouble

01:57.035 --> 01:58.745
Hey, Ia, hey, Ia,
his girlfriend's back

01:58.828 --> 02:00.789
Hey, Ia, hey, Ia,
my girlfriend's back

02:02.081 --> 02:04.000
A month ago, I walked
out of this office

02:04.083 --> 02:05.835
positive I was
never coming back.

02:07.378 --> 02:08.797
I probably shouldn't
have emailed everyone

02:08.880 --> 02:10.965
telling them exactly
what I thought of them.

02:11.216 --> 02:13.092
Hey, Erin, thank you
for the nice email.

02:13.968 --> 02:17.096
Yeah. I don't get emotional
a lot, but that was...

02:18.473 --> 02:19.849
I'm just glad to know
I had an impact.

02:20.475 --> 02:21.893
I meant every word.

02:22.811 --> 02:26.523
In other news, Erin and
Andy are back together.

02:27.190 --> 02:29.150
Crazy story.
Yes.

02:29.234 --> 02:32.153
I drove all the way down to
Florida, she was not expecting it,

02:32.237 --> 02:34.072
totally swept her off her feet.
Right? Yeah.

02:34.239 --> 02:35.240
How long
was the drive?

02:35.490 --> 02:36.991
It's like a day and
a half each way.

02:37.075 --> 02:40.453
But when I got there, I went right
up to the house, and I was like...

02:40.578 --> 02:43.498
Day and a half? My lumbar
would be killing me.

02:43.581 --> 02:47.377
You should get this lumbar support
cushion thing my dad has.

02:47.460 --> 02:48.753
What's it called?
Um...

02:49.754 --> 02:51.130
Not Easy-Rest.

02:51.422 --> 02:53.341
That gas must've cost
a pretty penny, huh?

02:53.424 --> 02:54.634
Well,
he's got a Prius.

02:54.759 --> 02:56.052
How many times you fill the tank?
Three, four?

02:56.261 --> 02:58.179
What does gas
cost down there?

02:58.263 --> 03:00.348
Lumbar Buddy!
Lumbar Buddy.

03:00.431 --> 03:01.558
Oh, yeah,
Lumbar Buddy.

03:01.641 --> 03:03.476
Tell you what,
I'll email you the story.

03:03.560 --> 03:05.144
It's a real
tearjerker, though.

03:05.228 --> 03:06.771
So read with caution.

03:07.105 --> 03:08.356
Anyway, I know it's
the end of the day.

03:08.439 --> 03:09.816
We just wanted to
stop by and say hi.

03:09.899 --> 03:12.402
And then later on, we have
a reservation at Patsel's.

03:13.611 --> 03:14.779
Miss Lumbar!

03:15.655 --> 03:17.240
Hey, Kev.
Yeah.

03:17.407 --> 03:19.951
Nice sweater.
Thank you!

03:20.535 --> 03:23.121
Nellie was nice enough
to give it to me.

03:23.705 --> 03:26.708
She's sweet. I just
wish there was pockets.

03:28.501 --> 03:30.211
What happened
to Old Salty?

03:30.295 --> 03:31.796
Nellie let me
bobble-ize him.

03:31.880 --> 03:34.090
His name is now
Captain Mutato.

03:35.133 --> 03:36.926
I've written quite a bit
of X-Men fan fiction.

03:37.010 --> 03:39.762
Captain Mutato is
half-man, half-mermaid.

03:39.846 --> 03:41.931
So he can fight
crime as a man

03:42.015 --> 03:43.641
and make love
as a mermaid.

03:44.601 --> 03:47.270
Most of my writing
involves the latter.

03:52.984 --> 03:53.985
Okey-doke

03:56.905 --> 03:57.989
Yes?

04:00.241 --> 04:01.242
ANDY; Whoa!

04:03.328 --> 04:06.873
Well, you must be the famous Nellie
Bertram I've been hearing all about.

04:06.998 --> 04:10.543
I am the famous Andy Bernard you
have been hearing all about.

04:10.668 --> 04:12.420
Oh, yes. I just
want to thank you

04:12.503 --> 04:15.423
for jumping in and
minding the store

04:15.506 --> 04:16.883
during my temporary absence.

04:17.050 --> 04:19.260
You are most welcome.

04:19.469 --> 04:22.680
Anyway, now that I'm back, I would
love to have my office back,

04:22.764 --> 04:24.807
whenever you get a chance. No.

04:25.642 --> 04:29.938
Obviously we'll figure
out the logistics

04:30.021 --> 04:32.440
of moving all of this
stuff out of here.

04:33.107 --> 04:36.569
But, you know, the sooner the better.
Get back to normalcy.

04:36.903 --> 04:37.946
Mmm. No.

04:42.241 --> 04:43.242
Thank you.

04:44.535 --> 04:45.536
Okay.

04:45.620 --> 04:46.704
Wait. Uh...

04:46.955 --> 04:49.958
When I showed up here,
there was no manager.

04:50.041 --> 04:52.085
It's like when the Americans
showed up at the Moon.

04:52.168 --> 04:53.461
Nobody was there.

04:53.544 --> 04:55.046
So they planted
their flag,

04:55.129 --> 04:56.756
and it's their
moon now, isn't it?

04:57.298 --> 05:00.927
Nobody likes it, but it's
America's bloody moon.

05:01.511 --> 05:04.347
Just lay him in his crib
and then bicycle his legs.

05:04.430 --> 05:05.682
And then after
Jim quiets down,

05:05.765 --> 05:07.141
you do the same thing
with your baby.

05:09.143 --> 05:10.937
But if he keeps having
problems, just give me a call.

05:11.020 --> 05:12.480
Oh, my gosh,
thank you so much.

05:12.563 --> 05:13.773
But seriously, we don't
want to bother you

05:13.898 --> 05:15.066
any more than we already have.
That's it.

05:15.525 --> 05:16.943
It's no bother.
You guys are our friends.

05:17.318 --> 05:19.070
Ravi, our amazing
pediatrician,

05:19.153 --> 05:21.322
was asking us if
we knew any girls,

05:21.406 --> 05:23.950
and I said, "I know
the perfect girl."

05:24.033 --> 05:28.955
Yeah. Because Kelly is Indian and...
Oh, that's it!

05:30.206 --> 05:32.583
Race had nothing
to do with it.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.460
I just knew they'd
be good together.

05:34.961 --> 05:35.962
Why?

05:36.045 --> 05:38.339
Kelly has been
a handful in the past.

05:38.423 --> 05:39.841
But she's had
a bad influence.

05:39.924 --> 05:42.927
She's like an addict, and I
just had to get her clean.

05:43.886 --> 05:44.846
Get lower.

05:44.929 --> 05:47.432
Next, I'm going to set up
my sister with Darryl.

05:47.515 --> 05:48.891
Okay, we get it.

05:48.933 --> 05:51.519
What? I think they'd be good together.
Really?

05:54.897 --> 05:57.692
Um, also, little tip,
never shake the baby.

05:59.152 --> 06:01.279
Sorry, just to be clear, you're
saying do not shake the baby?

06:01.362 --> 06:02.447
Don't shake the baby.

06:02.530 --> 06:04.866
A lot of times parents get frustrated
because the baby's crying,

06:04.949 --> 06:08.911
and they shake the baby,
and you got to...

06:08.995 --> 06:09.996
You can't do that.

06:10.204 --> 06:11.789
Don't shake our baby.
Yeah.

06:11.873 --> 06:13.499
Okay, I'd never
heard that before.

06:13.624 --> 06:14.584
Oh, my God.
So, thank you.

06:14.667 --> 06:16.669
Yeah, I'm glad you said something.
Me, too.

06:17.545 --> 06:19.881
Kelly and I broke up, and she
can do whatever she wants.

06:19.964 --> 06:22.091
And her new boyfriend
seems awesome,

06:22.175 --> 06:24.010
if you're into
Indian people.

06:24.385 --> 06:25.636
I'm not.

06:27.638 --> 06:29.057
And that's
when I realized,

06:29.140 --> 06:31.017
if you're gonna put a
thermometer in one end,

06:31.100 --> 06:33.311
you'd better put a
lollipop in the other.

06:33.895 --> 06:36.564
Hey, I'm sorry. Is this a
workplace or a Starbucks?

06:36.647 --> 06:39.317
Because I was under the
impression it was a workplace.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.735
Maybe I'm
the crazy one.

06:40.818 --> 06:42.987
No. No, we're sorry.
Come on, let's go, Ravi.

06:43.071 --> 06:45.990
Also, since when do we have
guests here without clearance?

06:46.074 --> 06:47.492
I didn't okay this.

06:49.327 --> 06:50.328
Hey, um...

06:51.120 --> 06:53.456
What's the deal with this guy?
He's really into Kelly, huh?

06:54.082 --> 06:55.666
Yeah, they're
really great together.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.251
Makes me wonder
if I made a mistake.

06:57.335 --> 07:00.546
No, no, no. Come on. I think you
guys are both happier now, right?

07:00.630 --> 07:03.049
You're single. Plenty of
girls to date, right?

07:04.342 --> 07:05.343
Yeah.

07:06.052 --> 07:08.596
Maybe we weren't right
together, but it's weird,

07:08.679 --> 07:12.266
I'd rather she be alone
than with somebody.

07:13.184 --> 07:14.185
Is that love?

07:17.021 --> 07:18.898
That's about it, yeah.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.319
Well, Nellie picked up
the slack around here

07:23.402 --> 07:26.280
while you were trolling
the Florida beaches for tail

07:26.364 --> 07:28.366
like some college student
on spring break.

07:29.867 --> 07:31.828
I had to tell Erin
how I felt.

07:31.911 --> 07:33.871
Andy, I appreciate
your romantic quest,

07:33.955 --> 07:36.707
and in an age before the
telephone or Internet,

07:36.874 --> 07:39.085
or written language,
that would be compelling.

07:39.168 --> 07:41.629
But there are five, six
devices in this room alone

07:41.712 --> 07:44.382
that would have let you tell her
that without ever going to Florida.

07:44.465 --> 07:47.260
We live in
amazing times.

07:47.385 --> 07:49.428
Yeah, I know
I screwed up.

07:50.346 --> 07:53.141
But I always do
whatever you ask of me,

07:53.224 --> 07:55.518
and this will never
happen again.

07:55.893 --> 07:58.896
And if Erin decides she's made a
mistake and returns to Florida?

07:59.814 --> 08:03.568
At least she knows how I feel,
and I would not follow her.

08:06.362 --> 08:10.366
What if she were kidnapped by a
gang of Albanian human traffickers?

08:12.243 --> 08:13.452
Like in Taken?

08:13.703 --> 08:14.704
What?

08:15.079 --> 08:16.956
Yes, of course,
if she's taken.

08:17.039 --> 08:19.167
That's what I'm talking about.
By Albanians.

08:19.750 --> 08:21.335
I would stay
in this office.

08:22.420 --> 08:25.089
Wow, okay. I'll
remember you said that.

08:31.429 --> 08:32.847
Nellie,

08:34.307 --> 08:38.603
you've been terrific
in your interim capacity,

08:38.728 --> 08:41.063
but Andrew is
the rightful manager,

08:41.147 --> 08:43.941
so if you would just
give him his office.

08:44.108 --> 08:45.985
No.
I'm sorry?

08:47.278 --> 08:49.947
This is what I was
trying to tell you.

08:51.032 --> 08:53.451
I'm not accustomed to
people saying no to me.

08:53.534 --> 08:56.495
Well, Bobby,
get accustomed to it,

08:56.579 --> 09:01.959
because then it feels so good
when they finally say yes.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.677
You're both adults.
I'm sure you can

09:13.679 --> 09:16.432
figure this out
between yourselves.

09:19.560 --> 09:23.731
I never allow sexual desire to
influence a business decision.

09:23.814 --> 09:28.194
So, I find it best to
recuse myself temporarily

09:28.277 --> 09:29.904
until I've had
a chance to make love,

09:30.029 --> 09:34.742
and then go back and analyze
the situation rationally.

09:36.827 --> 09:39.538
Buffett operates
the same way.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.085
I want to order the zebra
rug for my office,

09:44.168 --> 09:46.170
but can you dye it
entirely black?

09:48.005 --> 09:49.882
No, I still want it
to be a zebra.

09:51.259 --> 09:52.510
Well, I'll know.

09:53.803 --> 09:55.846
Because they're
ridiculous creatures.

09:56.472 --> 09:57.431
They don't know
what they are.

09:57.515 --> 09:59.934
Phyllis says J. Duffy's
might be more our speed.

10:00.017 --> 10:02.853
And if we want even the option
of drawing on the placemats...

10:05.147 --> 10:07.316
I got a little bit
of an anger problem.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.902
Got me in some trouble
a couple years ago.

10:09.986 --> 10:11.696
When I see him
start to get mad,

10:11.779 --> 10:15.324
I just put my hand
on his arm like this.

10:16.909 --> 10:19.829
It reminds me to just
check out and relax.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.875
There's also a lullaby they used to
sing to me when I was growing up.

10:26.419 --> 10:30.339
The state of Pennsylvania
is watching over you

10:30.756 --> 10:34.760
No need for parents,
the governor will do

10:35.052 --> 10:36.304
It's really nice.

10:37.972 --> 10:41.976
The General Assembly's
like a mom and a dad

10:46.230 --> 10:47.440
...had

10:49.608 --> 10:52.361
I got a call
about a trespasser.

10:52.903 --> 10:55.114
Yes. Right this way.

10:57.491 --> 11:01.996
Because they are idiots.
Big, stripy, horsey idiots.

11:02.079 --> 11:04.290
What you don't... Hey!

11:04.498 --> 11:06.834
Hank, please remove
Nellie from my office.

11:07.126 --> 11:08.169
Hank, thank God
you're here.

11:08.252 --> 11:10.588
This psychopath keeps
barging into my office.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.590
It's my office.

11:13.966 --> 11:16.677
Well, she's sitting
there like a manager.

11:17.762 --> 11:19.513
And you're standing
up here like me.

11:20.556 --> 11:23.768
But maybe it's a little
more complicated than that.

11:30.149 --> 11:31.901
I'm going to
count down from five,

11:31.984 --> 11:34.028
and if you're not
out of my office,

11:34.111 --> 11:36.822
I'm going to
dock your pay $100.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.283
Five, four...

11:39.367 --> 11:40.743
You can't dock my pay.

11:40.826 --> 11:42.536
I am your boss.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.538
Three, two, one.

11:44.622 --> 11:46.832
Congratulations,
you just lost $100.

11:47.166 --> 11:48.167
Really?

11:49.126 --> 11:53.422
Angela,
dock Andy's pay $100!

11:53.756 --> 11:54.924
On it!

11:55.549 --> 11:59.637
Great! Five, four,
three, two, one.

12:00.596 --> 12:04.809
Angela, please dock
Nellie's pay $100.

12:08.354 --> 12:09.355
Hmm?

12:09.814 --> 12:11.607
Is she responding? Hmm...

12:12.483 --> 12:14.652
Angela? Do you want to go again?

12:15.111 --> 12:16.654
Angela!
Let's go again.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.490
Five, four, three,
two, one.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.701
Oh, she's counting again.
Look out.

12:22.785 --> 12:26.122
- Angela, $200!
- Got it!

12:26.956 --> 12:28.332
Seriously, Angela?

12:28.416 --> 12:33.629
I know what,
let's go $10,000.

12:33.838 --> 12:36.507
Five, four... You're
just saying numbers.

12:36.590 --> 12:38.384
It's meaningless.
Three...

12:38.467 --> 12:42.930
It's literally like...
Two, one...

12:49.186 --> 12:50.521
I have to pee.

12:58.195 --> 13:00.030
There you go.

13:01.198 --> 13:03.701
Hey, we're going to
have a nice hot date.

13:07.830 --> 13:09.248
What are you guys
talking about?

13:09.331 --> 13:11.250
Charlie Rose.
I don't know who that is.

13:11.333 --> 13:12.334
Guys.
He has...

13:12.418 --> 13:13.961
Guys, come here.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.215
What are you...
Come on!

13:21.302 --> 13:22.678
Where are we going?

13:23.596 --> 13:25.389
Okay. Do you guys want...

13:25.473 --> 13:27.391
Andy, you should
not stand there.

13:27.475 --> 13:30.060
The warehouse guys
pee there all the time.

13:31.437 --> 13:32.438
Ew.

13:34.190 --> 13:37.109
Okay. Do you guys want to
be part of something huge?

13:37.234 --> 13:39.153
I'm already a member of the
largest club there is.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.613
Non-churchgoing
Christians.

13:42.865 --> 13:44.909
You remember in
the movie Rudy,

13:44.992 --> 13:47.870
when the player comes
into the coach's office

13:47.953 --> 13:49.872
and he throws his jersey
down, and he's like,

13:49.955 --> 13:51.415
"I'm not playing
without Rudy."

13:51.499 --> 13:53.876
And the coach is like,
"One guy. No big deal."

13:53.959 --> 13:56.587
But then every player
comes in, one by one,

13:56.712 --> 13:59.965
and they all throw their jerseys
down for Rudy. Remember that?

14:00.090 --> 14:02.092
Yeah, I remember that.

14:02.176 --> 14:04.720
So, how amazing
would it be

14:04.803 --> 14:07.848
if you guys all
did that for me

14:08.432 --> 14:11.519
with your own brand new
Dunder Mifflin jerseys?

14:12.144 --> 14:13.479
Hey, guys.

14:20.569 --> 14:23.072
Gross. Gross, gross.

14:23.155 --> 14:24.448
You don't need to go.

14:24.740 --> 14:26.575
I found these the other day
while I was journaling,

14:26.659 --> 14:28.160
and they reminded
me of you.

14:29.620 --> 14:30.996
Those are from our
weekend at the time-share.

14:31.121 --> 14:32.957
Yeah, the fractional
ownership property.

14:34.375 --> 14:36.460
We took this one right before
we got in that huge fight.

14:37.503 --> 14:38.963
God, I don't even remember
what that fight was about.

14:39.046 --> 14:40.047
You were being
really bratty about

14:40.130 --> 14:41.215
where we would
go out to dinner,

14:41.298 --> 14:45.678
but all I remember is how pretty you
looked taking those pictures of me.

14:47.388 --> 14:49.515
Anyway, if you want to
order prints of your own,

14:49.598 --> 14:51.058
I can send you the link.

14:51.141 --> 14:52.851
Yeah, that'd
be cool. Thanks.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.019
I'd like that.

14:54.562 --> 14:57.064
You were so annoyed that I
was taking that picture.

14:57.314 --> 14:59.024
Someone's into my abs.

15:03.654 --> 15:04.655
Sorry.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.617
You have doubles of this one, I
could probably just take one.

15:08.701 --> 15:09.910
I really want both.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.664
I am seeing a side of Ryan
that I have never seen

15:13.747 --> 15:15.416
since the last time
we were broken up.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.168
I am in love
with Kelly Kapoor.

15:18.419 --> 15:21.255
And I don't know how I'm going
to feel tomorrow or the next day

15:21.338 --> 15:26.051
or the day after that, but I do
know that right here, right now,

15:26.135 --> 15:30.014
all I can think about is spending
the rest of my life with her.

15:31.682 --> 15:33.517
Again, that could change.

15:35.603 --> 15:39.189
Hey. So, last night
was so not a big deal.

15:39.398 --> 15:40.816
Oh, yeah,
I was just tired.

15:40.858 --> 15:42.067
We both were.
Yeah.

15:42.151 --> 15:44.903
Plus I was definitely
not my normal sexy self.

15:45.613 --> 15:48.907
No. Are you kidding?
You were so sexy.

15:48.991 --> 15:52.536
Just the thought of you last
night, like, crazy turns me on.

15:53.621 --> 15:57.041
It just didn't last night.
But you were so dang doable.

15:57.458 --> 15:58.459
Even though we didn't do it.

15:58.584 --> 16:02.254
Well, it's not like we can't do it again when...
Whenever you're ready.

16:03.297 --> 16:06.717
Uh, yeah. We are sexing it up tonight.
I don't care what you say.

16:06.925 --> 16:09.553
No. It will be consensual.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.722
Whether you like it or not.

16:12.389 --> 16:15.017
Sounds good.
I'm gonna do you.

16:15.100 --> 16:16.644
Not if I do you first.
Oh.

16:19.063 --> 16:21.565
But really,
it's not a big deal.

16:25.361 --> 16:29.531
Yeah. I know it's
not a big deal.

16:33.827 --> 16:36.705
Oh, hey, instead of lunch, do
you feel like going shopping?

16:37.665 --> 16:39.750
Are you serious? Yes.

16:40.793 --> 16:43.379
That would be... I can't...
Can you believe this?

16:43.754 --> 16:45.214
Hey, can you believe it? Nope.

16:46.924 --> 16:47.925
Hmm.

16:48.634 --> 16:51.220
Oh, do you want that dress in
every size and every color?

16:51.387 --> 16:52.680
Yeah, it's free returns.

16:54.515 --> 16:56.141
I saw you were getting
along with Ryan again.

16:56.892 --> 17:00.270
He's so sweet. He pointed
to my latte and he said,

17:00.354 --> 17:02.773
"Kelly, that would be
the color of our children."

17:03.732 --> 17:05.818
God. Yeah, he's so great.

17:08.112 --> 17:10.447
Remember how it felt when
he cheated on you, though?

17:10.864 --> 17:11.865
Which time?

17:14.451 --> 17:18.789
I am not going to let Kelly
throw her life away on Ryan.

17:19.623 --> 17:23.168
And it has nothing to do with
access to my pediatrician.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.629
Why you would even ask,
or were going to ask.

17:25.713 --> 17:28.090
Because I feel like
that question was coming.

17:28.173 --> 17:30.551
But, you know, whatever.
Ask me anything.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.761
Yes? When you lost
the manager job?

17:32.845 --> 17:36.348
...did it affect you
outside of the office?

17:36.473 --> 17:37.641
How?

17:38.058 --> 17:40.602
I don't know what
the technical term is.

17:42.229 --> 17:45.733
Penial softy-osus.

17:48.986 --> 17:50.988
Erin, I am so glad
that you trusted me.

17:51.321 --> 17:53.991
You came to the exact
right person for this.

17:54.199 --> 17:57.453
No, I have never once experienced
anything remotely like that.

17:57.786 --> 17:59.663
Ever, ever. Never!

18:03.751 --> 18:05.169
Okay?
Okay,

18:06.253 --> 18:08.005
Washington Monument!
Okay.

18:10.799 --> 18:12.301
Eiffel Tower!
Okay.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.095
Colossus at Rhodes!

18:16.680 --> 18:19.433
Hey! I hear you've been
badmouthing me to Kelly.

18:20.559 --> 18:22.936
All I did was remind her that
you used to treat her badly.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.440
Well, that's your opinion and it's her
opinion, but it's not my opinion.

18:26.523 --> 18:29.902
If you have something bad to say
to me, Pam, say it to my face.

18:30.569 --> 18:31.820
Fair enough. Um...

18:34.907 --> 18:36.658
I don't think you're
a very good person.

18:37.284 --> 18:39.995
And forgive me, but I feel like
I've said this to you before.

18:40.078 --> 18:41.163
I don't like you very much.

18:41.246 --> 18:45.125
Well, a lot of people would say that I'm
a better match for Kelly than Ravi is.

18:45.542 --> 18:49.379
Come on, Ryan, really?
Ravi's way better.

18:50.339 --> 18:52.007
For Kelly?
Yeah.

18:52.090 --> 18:55.969
Man, you're insane right now.
Ravi's the whole package.

18:56.053 --> 18:58.305
I've never met Ravi,
personally,

18:58.388 --> 18:59.932
but I'm going to
go ahead and say

19:00.015 --> 19:02.684
just having known you
a short while, Brian,

19:02.768 --> 19:07.064
that I prefer Ravi, and again,
I've never even met the guy.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.192
Kelly, look around.
Nobody believes in us.

19:10.567 --> 19:11.568
Nobody.

19:11.902 --> 19:14.738
Ryan, just stop making a scene
in front of all my friends.

19:15.072 --> 19:18.075
Kelly, I wrote you the
most amazing love poem.

19:18.784 --> 19:22.579
But I can't even read it.
My heart couldn't handle it.

19:22.663 --> 19:24.748
Oh, come on... Oh, no,
no, no, read it, please.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.458
I love amazing poetry.

19:26.542 --> 19:28.502
No, it would cause
me too much pain.

19:28.585 --> 19:29.878
Read through
the pain. Be strong.

19:29.962 --> 19:31.839
This poem would
crush you.

19:31.922 --> 19:35.008
God, Ryan, go away! She found
herself a beautiful boyfriend.

19:35.092 --> 19:37.970
Yeah, man, he's
absolutely gorgeous.

19:38.053 --> 19:39.346
Please leave her alone.

19:39.429 --> 19:42.307
You see, Kelly?
Our love scares them.

19:42.391 --> 19:45.102
It screws up their
cookie cutter world!

19:50.899 --> 19:52.651
Do you guys think
he's right, though?

19:54.444 --> 19:56.864
Do we live in a
cookie cutter's world?

19:56.947 --> 19:59.700
Absolutely, but it's
not the point. God.

20:01.243 --> 20:04.788
One of Toby's eyes is getting smaller.
So there's that.

20:05.789 --> 20:09.167
Gabe bragged about having an extra
ticket to the air show this weekend

20:09.251 --> 20:12.880
and Meredith said she was interested,
and then Gabe said immediately

20:12.963 --> 20:15.257
that his friend might
be taking the ticket,

20:15.340 --> 20:17.885
so I'll keep you
posted on that.

20:18.176 --> 20:20.721
Every day, I brief Nellie on
what's going on in the office.

20:20.804 --> 20:21.889
Most of it's irrelevant.

20:21.972 --> 20:24.474
But a good informer doesn't
judge what's worth passing on.

20:24.808 --> 20:26.643
Oh, and Andy lost
his masculinity,

20:26.727 --> 20:27.895
so congratulations
on that.

20:28.228 --> 20:29.229
What do you mean?

20:29.438 --> 20:30.898
Erin made it clear to me
that he was unable

20:30.981 --> 20:32.399
to perform sexually
last night.

20:32.482 --> 20:34.526
By contrast, I went to sleep
with an erection so large

20:34.610 --> 20:36.320
it was like I was
wearing no blanket at all.

20:37.195 --> 20:40.490
I knew you'd win, but you
just demolished him!

20:41.283 --> 20:42.743
I'm little bit
jealous, actually.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.995
Reduced him to a mere ant!

20:45.329 --> 20:48.749
I just wanted to take the
man's job, not his manhood.

20:49.583 --> 20:51.460
Are we good?
Everybody got a jersey?

20:51.919 --> 20:54.588
I still think it's weird
that we're just doing Rudy.

20:54.671 --> 20:57.382
Like, not a spin on it,
we're just doing it.

20:57.466 --> 21:00.177
What about The Dead Poets Society?
Much better movie.

21:00.344 --> 21:03.013
What? Get your movie
rankings right, dude.

21:03.096 --> 21:04.806
Why can't we just do
whatever movie we want?

21:04.890 --> 21:06.183
'Cause I was gonna
do a Spartacus.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.643
Oh, I wanna do
a Spartacus.

21:07.726 --> 21:08.894
I am Spartacus!

21:08.977 --> 21:10.437
No, I am Spartacus!

21:10.854 --> 21:14.149
Hey, guys, we're doing Rudy, okay?
So get ready.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.110
Okay, I would like to invite
everyone into the conference room.

21:17.194 --> 21:19.279
Sure. But first,
there is something...

21:19.363 --> 21:21.281
No, that's not important.
Conference room, now.

21:21.406 --> 21:23.867
You can't
call a meeting, so...

21:25.452 --> 21:26.954
But I would like
to have a meeting

21:27.037 --> 21:28.205
in the conference
room right now,

21:28.288 --> 21:30.832
so come on, guys, let's get
in the conference room.

21:30.916 --> 21:32.209
Thank you. Good!

21:32.709 --> 21:34.378
Thank you for
coming to my meeting.

21:34.461 --> 21:35.462
Appreciate it.

21:36.171 --> 21:39.007
Okay, if you would like to
take a seat, we can get started.

21:39.174 --> 21:41.385
Can't do it because I got
to run a meeting, so...

21:41.718 --> 21:45.555
Wanted to talk to all of
you guys about importance

21:46.556 --> 21:52.729
and know that each and every one
of you is vitally important.

21:52.813 --> 21:57.150
Andrew, not everyone here is important.
And the word is "impotence."

21:57.317 --> 22:00.737
Which is important
in its own way,

22:00.821 --> 22:02.280
so if you'd just like
to take a seat, Andy.

22:02.531 --> 22:04.992
Take a man's job,
but leave him his balls.

22:05.075 --> 22:07.411
Margaret Thatcher
said that, probably.

22:07.744 --> 22:09.913
Don't know. Don't read.
Didn't see the movie.

22:10.414 --> 22:12.833
So, Nellie wanted to have
a meeting on impotence.

22:12.916 --> 22:15.127
I told her she would have to run
it, as impotence is a concept

22:15.210 --> 22:17.087
as foreign to me
as baba ghanoush.

22:19.006 --> 22:20.674
Something to do
with eggplant.

22:21.925 --> 22:23.010
That's all I know.

22:23.885 --> 22:27.723
This meeting is not about any
one person in particular.

22:27.806 --> 22:30.559
It is a human problem. It's
not just a human problem.

22:30.892 --> 22:32.853
Flounders frequently
experience impotence,

22:32.936 --> 22:34.646
especially when converting
from male to female

22:34.771 --> 22:36.690
- and then back again to male.
- Really?

22:36.773 --> 22:40.485
Nellie, does the "person" affected
by this want us to help her

22:40.610 --> 22:41.862
in any way in particular?

22:41.945 --> 22:42.988
Oh! Oh!

22:43.071 --> 22:44.740
It's not me. No, no!

22:44.823 --> 22:47.200
I've never had any
problem in that arena.

22:47.284 --> 22:49.911
And I have been
with several older men.

22:50.120 --> 22:51.079
How old?
How old?

22:51.163 --> 22:52.497
Jinx, buy me some Coke.

22:52.789 --> 22:54.458
Dwight told me
about it earlier.

22:54.833 --> 22:56.126
Dwight?

22:57.002 --> 22:58.003
You promised.

22:58.086 --> 22:59.838
Dwight couldn't
get it up for Nellie?

22:59.921 --> 23:02.215
No,no,no,no,no,
it's not me.

23:02.632 --> 23:04.885
I'm going to prove it
right here and now.

23:05.469 --> 23:08.221
What are you doing?
Stop that, Dwight!

23:08.764 --> 23:10.140
Stop that, stop it!

23:11.308 --> 23:15.312
Fine, it was me. I couldn't... I had
a problem with Erin last night.

23:15.395 --> 23:16.563
Happy?

23:16.730 --> 23:20.901
I had a lot on my mind last
night, and I didn't perform.

23:21.943 --> 23:23.862
Okay, it happens
to plenty of guys.

23:24.696 --> 23:29.284
It's usually not followed by a giant
workplace discussion and an interview.

23:30.911 --> 23:36.541
Every guy in this room has been
touched by this affliction. Tuna?

23:36.917 --> 23:38.168
D-Dog!

23:38.251 --> 23:39.252
Um...

23:39.920 --> 23:40.921
Um...

23:41.922 --> 23:44.382
I have other issues.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.511
I'm terrible at math,
overweight.

23:47.719 --> 23:51.890
You're in great shape. A lot better
shape than I am, tell you what.

23:52.140 --> 23:55.685
It seems Andy is the only
one with this problem.

23:55.769 --> 23:57.229
Fascinating.
Fascinating.

23:57.312 --> 24:00.357
I don't really see what the problem is.
Erin doesn't even like sex.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.026
Remember? You said it feels like
getting tackled by a skeleton.

24:03.527 --> 24:06.613
Chumbo, come on, help me out. Any
problems with Little Chumbo?

24:06.863 --> 24:08.031
Tip Top shape!

24:08.907 --> 24:11.368
Stanley.
No. Mmm-mmm.

24:11.660 --> 24:13.787
Creed, you are
1,000 years old.

24:14.162 --> 24:16.623
Haven't heard any complaints.
Wouldn't care if I did.

24:17.124 --> 24:18.208
Okay, so...
Actually, Andy,

24:18.333 --> 24:21.128
I think maybe
we've experienced it.

24:21.211 --> 24:22.212
What happened?

24:22.838 --> 24:25.465
A couple of times.
A couple of times?

24:25.549 --> 24:28.176
Jim, maybe you could tell us
about one of those times.

24:28.260 --> 24:29.553
- Yeah. Get it out there.
- Yeah, Jim.

24:29.678 --> 24:30.679
Um...

24:31.054 --> 24:32.264
I don't...

24:33.974 --> 24:37.435
Uh, yes, that time
that it was very late.

24:37.894 --> 24:38.937
Uh...

24:39.020 --> 24:42.858
We had had sex so many times
already, I was exhausted.

24:42.983 --> 24:44.860
Okay, stop. I could barely see.
I was very drunk.

24:44.985 --> 24:46.570
If it makes you
feel any better,

24:46.653 --> 24:49.489
I never had an orgasm
until I was 42.

24:49.698 --> 24:53.368
And then when I did,
it lasted until I was 44.

24:53.827 --> 24:55.787
Forty-three was just...

24:57.080 --> 24:58.832
I got nothing done.

24:59.583 --> 25:02.169
I've read, and I don't know
anything about this personally,

25:02.252 --> 25:04.421
but they say prostate
stimulation can help.

25:04.504 --> 25:05.505
Ugh.

25:05.589 --> 25:07.507
This is just a This American
Life I think I heard.

25:07.632 --> 25:10.010
No, that's absolutely the case.
I know, right?

25:10.093 --> 25:13.972
You know my rectal electro-ejaculator
is rated for bovine use only,

25:14.055 --> 25:15.056
but I could let you rent it.

25:15.765 --> 25:19.728
Andy, why don't you tell us about
the best erection of your life?

25:19.936 --> 25:24.107
Or does anyone else have any remarkable
erections they'd like to share?

25:24.232 --> 25:25.358
Wow. Oh! What are
we talking about?

25:25.442 --> 25:27.360
Toby, doesn't HR
have some rules

25:27.444 --> 25:28.820
against talking about
this kind of stuff?

25:29.321 --> 25:32.574
Erin, HR is a joke. I can't
do anything about anything.

25:32.657 --> 25:36.661
The most important thing to remember
is do not stress about this.

25:36.745 --> 25:39.122
Stress just makes it worse

25:39.206 --> 25:42.500
and then you stress more,
and that's a vicious spiral.

25:43.376 --> 25:45.587
I almost didn't
come in today.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.924
Dad, don't think
of it as a demotion,

25:49.007 --> 25:51.509
just think of it as a
promotion to a lower level.

25:51.927 --> 25:54.262
I don't think you have to
tell your friends anything.

25:54.346 --> 25:55.680
It hasn't been
decided yet.

25:55.764 --> 25:58.600
Erin, on the phone memos, you're
writing the date American style.

25:58.683 --> 26:01.895
Month, day, year. I prefer
it day, month, year.

26:01.978 --> 26:03.313
Small, bigger, biggest!

26:03.396 --> 26:04.397
Oh!

26:04.481 --> 26:06.524
Sexual innuendo
not intentional.

26:06.983 --> 26:09.819
Shut up. Shut up, liar!

26:10.445 --> 26:14.157
"Sexual innuendo
not intentional!"

26:14.366 --> 26:17.494
I am sick of
your dumb opinions

26:17.744 --> 26:21.706
and if you don't like the way
that I take phone messages, here!

26:22.457 --> 26:23.541
Take them yourself!

26:25.961 --> 26:29.256
Our sex life is none
of anyone's business!

26:29.381 --> 26:32.842
And Andy is the manager!
Not Nellie!

26:33.093 --> 26:36.137
Stop protecting me! I'm a man!
I can protect myself!

26:36.221 --> 26:37.764
This is misdirected anger
and I'm sorry!

26:37.847 --> 26:38.932
I don't mean to
lash out at you!

26:39.015 --> 26:41.268
There's a lot coming up
right now all at once!

26:41.351 --> 26:43.353
Dad, go to hell!
I'm taller than you!

26:43.478 --> 26:45.313
Okay, just calm down.

26:45.689 --> 26:48.483
You are not the manager.
I earned that job!

26:48.858 --> 26:51.278
I was personally chosen after
Robert was chosen and quit!

26:51.653 --> 26:53.238
Andy, why don't you
just take a seat?

26:53.363 --> 26:55.156
Why don't you
take a seat, idiot?

26:56.157 --> 26:58.702
Why don't you take
all your stupid memos?

26:58.868 --> 27:01.955
And your stupid pens
and your dumb caramels!

27:02.414 --> 27:04.416
And your stupid face!

27:05.250 --> 27:07.085
And your stupid office!

27:07.961 --> 27:08.962
Ah! OW.

27:13.008 --> 27:15.093
He does not
like that wall.

27:18.596 --> 27:21.808
Maybe we'll get sent to
anger management together.

27:23.560 --> 27:27.063
That would actually be cool. I'd love
for you to meet some of the guys.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.903
Andy, Erin,
you can join us now.

27:48.209 --> 27:49.919
What do you like
about Ryan?

27:50.337 --> 27:53.631
Ryan keeps up with all
the latest technology trends.

27:53.715 --> 27:56.593
And he's very honest with me
about when I put on weight.

27:57.761 --> 28:00.472
And he has the soul
and the body of a poet.

28:00.764 --> 28:01.765
Mmm.

28:01.848 --> 28:02.932
Ravi's hotter.

28:03.475 --> 28:05.560
I mean, I'm a straight man,
and looks are subjective,

28:05.643 --> 28:07.479
but there's no
question about it.

28:07.937 --> 28:09.064
Yeah, but I'm just worried

28:09.147 --> 28:10.273
that I'm only
attracted to Ravi

28:10.357 --> 28:13.318
because he looks exactly like this Calvin
Klein model that I'm attracted to.

28:13.443 --> 28:14.694
Who cares? That's fine.

28:14.778 --> 28:17.280
When I was your age, I had to
choose between a Ryan and a Ravi,

28:17.364 --> 28:18.740
and I chose the Ryan.

28:20.075 --> 28:22.118
And if I hadn't,
I wouldn't have my kids.

28:23.828 --> 28:25.121
You'd still have kids.

28:26.831 --> 28:28.583
Better kids. You've
got to go with Ravi.

28:29.209 --> 28:32.796
Here's my advice. Figure
out what your heart wants.

28:32.879 --> 28:35.799
And if it's not Ravi,
change it. To Ravi.

28:41.179 --> 28:43.848
I don't understand why
this is a dilemma for you.

28:44.849 --> 28:46.768
He has, like,
this je ne sais quoi.

28:48.353 --> 28:49.479
He taught me that.

28:52.315 --> 28:54.275
Ravi makes me
incredibly happy.

28:54.359 --> 28:56.903
And Ryan puts me
through so much drama.

28:56.986 --> 28:58.279
So I guess I just
have to decide

28:58.363 --> 29:00.990
which of those is
more important to me.

29:01.908 --> 29:05.078
Andy, we're going to go
with Nellie as manager

29:05.161 --> 29:07.163
and put you back
on the sales team.

29:07.288 --> 29:11.835
I promise you, in time, we'll
all laugh about this incident.

29:11.918 --> 29:14.379
I already think it's kind of funny.

29:21.553 --> 29:22.595
No.

29:23.638 --> 29:24.889
Excuse me?

29:26.015 --> 29:27.225
I'm saying no.

29:28.685 --> 29:30.520
Well, you can't say no.

29:30.979 --> 29:32.105
No.

29:36.025 --> 29:38.236
Oh. Boo!

29:38.319 --> 29:39.571
Holy crap!

29:40.196 --> 29:43.491
Boo! Boo! Boo to you. Pam, you are toxic.
You are toxic.

29:43.908 --> 29:47.704
Kelly, I have a few things to say
to you, but please don't interrupt.

29:47.829 --> 29:50.290
I wasn't going to interrupt. Yeah,
but you do a lot, so just don't.

29:50.373 --> 29:52.959
Thank you. I know that I
haven't always treated you

29:53.042 --> 29:55.003
the way that you,
for whatever reason,

29:55.086 --> 29:57.338
feel you deserve
to be treated.

29:57.547 --> 29:59.215
But I want to marry you,
Kelly Kapoor.

30:00.258 --> 30:03.470
Maybe not today, maybe not
tomorrow, but some day.

30:03.970 --> 30:04.971
And probably!

30:05.263 --> 30:07.640
Barf! Oh! You suck!

30:07.724 --> 30:09.142
What is your problem?

30:09.225 --> 30:11.603
Hey, can we turn this back
around quickly please?

30:11.728 --> 30:13.730
Can we turn this around quickly?
This is very important to me.

30:13.980 --> 30:16.149
Turn around.
Turn around.

30:16.232 --> 30:18.485
Can we turn this  thing
around, please? Thank you.

30:18.610 --> 30:20.403
She don't want to turn around.
Thank you.

30:21.654 --> 30:24.949
Kelly, I can't promise you that
we'll always stay together,

30:25.200 --> 30:28.161
I can't promise you that I'll
never cheat on you. Nor should I.

30:28.244 --> 30:30.997
Modern marriages aren't built that way.
Men aren't built that way.

30:31.080 --> 30:32.916
There's a very interesting
article I can email to you.

30:33.082 --> 30:35.710
But I can tell you this,
even if the odds are 50-50

30:35.793 --> 30:37.670
that we'll break up
within the week,

30:38.463 --> 30:39.881
I want to roll those dice.

30:41.049 --> 30:42.759
I love you, Kelly.
Ryan.

30:42.842 --> 30:44.093
Will you roll
those dice with me?

30:44.969 --> 30:47.096
You mean so much to me.

30:48.014 --> 30:51.100
But I love Ravi and I choose him.
No, you don't.

30:51.184 --> 30:52.185
I do.
No, you don't.

30:52.435 --> 30:54.145
I hope we can
still be friends.

30:57.690 --> 30:59.275
Can I have a hug?

31:06.616 --> 31:08.493
Oh. EW!

31:08.576 --> 31:11.412
Well, it's good to see
Kelly is maturing.

31:12.080 --> 31:13.373
Oh, God!

31:13.790 --> 31:18.378
Look, Andrew, we can discuss
the specifics of the job.

31:18.878 --> 31:19.879
No.

31:20.129 --> 31:22.257
It's the apology.
I really have to insist.

31:22.382 --> 31:24.300
No.
Stop saying "no."

31:24.509 --> 31:25.635
No.

31:25.718 --> 31:28.805
Andrew, if you say "no" one
more time, you're fired.

31:29.973 --> 31:33.393
So, is there anything
else you want to say?

31:34.811 --> 31:35.812
No.

31:36.020 --> 31:38.273
I can't describe it. I just, for
the first time in a long time,

31:38.356 --> 31:39.899
I actually feel in control.

31:40.817 --> 31:43.611
I feel alive.

31:43.945 --> 31:45.613
Here.

31:45.697 --> 31:46.698
I got it.

31:46.948 --> 31:50.034
But you hurt your hand.
I got it.

31:50.785 --> 31:52.870
Right now?
Yes.

32:08.803 --> 32:10.638
You're not the
least bit curious

32:10.722 --> 32:13.558
to hear a poem straight
from Ryan's soul?

32:13.641 --> 32:14.726
Not at all.
Can we go?

32:14.851 --> 32:17.478
"Kapoor and Ka-desperate,
he watches."

32:18.021 --> 32:20.189
Second line! "He is a
drifter out to sea."

32:21.190 --> 32:24.694
"And when the Indian Ocean calms,
one speck of white remains

32:25.361 --> 32:27.864
"in waters cold
and Kelly green."

32:28.031 --> 32:29.782
It's just so dumb.

32:31.409 --> 32:36.080
But when he describes himself as
a child lost on a life raft...

32:39.042 --> 32:40.793
Ryan can never know.
