WEBVTT

00:01.518 --> 00:04.314
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:04.452 --> 00:07.317
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:07.455 --> 00:11.873
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:12.012 --> 00:14.807
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:14.945 --> 00:17.707
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:17.845 --> 00:22.022
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:23.506 --> 00:25.922
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:26.060 --> 00:28.649
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:28.787 --> 00:31.307
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:31.445 --> 00:33.930
Just to get up that hill

00:34.068 --> 00:36.553
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:36.691 --> 00:39.142
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:39.280 --> 00:41.696
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:41.834 --> 00:43.422
Ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:43.560 --> 00:46.218
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:46.356 --> 00:49.325
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:49.463 --> 00:53.812
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:53.950 --> 00:56.677
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:56.815 --> 00:59.783
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:59.921 --> 01:03.994
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:10.070 --> 01:13.556
I'm so glad Helen
brought me down here
to meet you, Louise.

01:13.694 --> 01:16.766
And I do hope you'll be able
to come to the costume ball.

01:16.904 --> 01:19.838
Well, I must admit, it
sounds like fun.

01:19.976 --> 01:21.978
I've always loved dressing up.

01:22.116 --> 01:23.531
So do I.

01:23.669 --> 01:26.983
Tom and I had a
wonderful time at the
Society's dance last year.

01:27.121 --> 01:30.055
And we met a lot
of nice people.
That's right!

01:30.193 --> 01:31.643
I remember every time
I saw Tom,

01:31.781 --> 01:33.645
someone seemed to
be shaking his hand.

01:33.783 --> 01:36.406
His arm must have
ached for a week.

01:36.544 --> 01:40.514
Well, he should've
known better than to go
as a slot machine.

01:43.137 --> 01:46.175
Well, what'd you say, Louise?
Can I sell you a ticket?

01:46.313 --> 01:49.971
The Interracial Awareness
Society needs all the help
it can get, Louise.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.008
Sure!
Thanks.

01:52.146 --> 01:55.908
You'd be surprised how
many people still object
to mixed marriages.

01:56.046 --> 01:58.532
Oh, no, I wouldn't
be surprised.

02:01.086 --> 02:04.710
Really? Then you're a
very aware person.

02:04.848 --> 02:08.438
Well, I have a husband
who makes me aware.

02:09.129 --> 02:10.164
I'm glad to hear it.

02:10.302 --> 02:11.372
Hey, Weezy.

02:11.510 --> 02:13.926
Oh, Hi, George.

02:14.893 --> 02:16.619
I want you to meet
Mrs. Fletcher.

02:16.757 --> 02:18.517
Hi.
Hello.

02:18.655 --> 02:22.556
I'm always glad to meet
a man who's aware of
society's problems.

02:22.694 --> 02:25.352
Oh, yeah, I've got
plenty of problems. They
just keep turning up.

02:25.490 --> 02:27.630
Hi, Helen.
Nice to see you.

02:29.908 --> 02:33.222
It's always a pleasure
seeing you too, George.

02:34.430 --> 02:37.467
Uh, George, how'd you like
to go dancing this weekend?

02:37.605 --> 02:39.366
Hey, that sounds great, Weez.

02:39.504 --> 02:43.335
Good, cause Mrs. Fletcher
is selling tickets to
a big costume ball,

02:43.473 --> 02:44.578
and I told her we'd go.

02:44.716 --> 02:47.684
All right, fine... I ain't
been dancing in months!

02:47.822 --> 02:50.515
You'll have a ball at
our ball, as they say.

02:52.206 --> 02:54.381
And you'll be helping
the organization, too.

02:54.519 --> 02:55.796
Oh, yeah? What
organization is that?

02:55.934 --> 02:58.143
The Interracial
Awareness Society.

02:58.281 --> 03:00.318
The Interracial who?

03:01.905 --> 03:04.149
It helps to promote
understanding between...

03:04.287 --> 03:05.875
I understand what it promotes.

03:06.013 --> 03:08.188
What night did you say
the ball was?
Next Saturday.

03:08.326 --> 03:11.156
Oh, shoot! We ain't gonna
be able to make it!

03:12.261 --> 03:13.262
Why not?

03:13.400 --> 03:14.815
I'll give you one guess.

03:14.953 --> 03:17.058
I can't tell you, Weezy.
It would ruin the surprise.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.336
What surprise?

03:18.474 --> 03:21.201
The surprise I got planned
for you for next Saturday.

03:21.339 --> 03:22.409
George, you...

03:22.547 --> 03:24.859
Now, don't try and pry
it outta me.

03:24.997 --> 03:28.311
But of course you will
buy a ticket, to help
the cause, huh?

03:28.449 --> 03:30.348
No, I can't buy a ticket.
Why?

03:30.486 --> 03:32.281
It's part of the surprise.

03:32.419 --> 03:35.284
George, can I see you
in the kitchen?

03:35.422 --> 03:38.942
Sure, but you ain't gonna
trick me into telling you
about the surprise!

03:40.047 --> 03:41.876
George, I'm ashamed of you!

03:42.014 --> 03:44.189
Not wanting to help the
Interracial Society.

03:44.327 --> 03:47.019
Why should I pay
people too dumb to
marry their own color?

03:49.850 --> 03:53.163
For your information,
Mrs. Fletcher's husband
is white.

03:56.960 --> 03:58.721
You mean she's black?

04:02.172 --> 04:06.142
No. Mrs. Fletcher
has a son who's married
to a black girl.

04:06.280 --> 04:07.764
Huh, I wish I did!

04:09.283 --> 04:12.976
Oh, come on, George, why
are you making such a big deal

04:13.114 --> 04:15.876
out of going to the ball?
It could be a lot of fun.

04:16.014 --> 04:18.637
Everybody's going.
The Willises, Mr. Bentley...

04:18.775 --> 04:21.226
Look, Weezy, for the
last time, I am not
wasting good money

04:21.364 --> 04:23.780
to buy tickets and rent
costumes to go to that ball.

04:23.918 --> 04:25.748
You don't have to pay
for the costumes.

04:25.886 --> 04:28.337
Mrs. Fletcher's
husband is donating them.

04:28.475 --> 04:30.097
Say what?

04:30.235 --> 04:34.481
Mr. Fletcher's company is
providing free costumes to
anybody who wants to go.

04:34.619 --> 04:37.829
Is this woman's husband the
Mr. Fletcher who owns
that uh costume company?

04:37.967 --> 04:39.486
Yes.

04:39.624 --> 04:41.695
Oh, that's one of
the biggest costume
companies in town.

04:41.833 --> 04:44.284
Huh! And all them
costumes get dirty.

04:45.733 --> 04:46.665
What?

04:46.803 --> 04:48.909
Oh, I said,
"It's almost 7:30."

04:49.875 --> 04:52.050
Weezy, you should
be ashamed of me.

04:52.188 --> 04:54.294
In fact, I should be
ashamed of me.

04:54.432 --> 04:57.020
Are you trying to say
you've changed your mind?

04:57.158 --> 04:59.195
Sure. How can I turn
down a free costume?

05:00.576 --> 05:04.373
Mrs. Fletcher, we've decided
we're going to the ball!

05:04.511 --> 05:05.684
Wonderful!

05:05.822 --> 05:07.065
Yeah, Louise
made me realize

05:07.203 --> 05:09.343
I've got a good chance
to do somebody some good.

05:09.481 --> 05:10.896
But what about the surprise?

05:11.034 --> 05:14.279
This is it, I'm
going to the dance!

05:14.417 --> 05:15.936
You know, Mr. Jefferson,
for a minute there

05:16.074 --> 05:18.041
I thought you were trying to
get out of buying a ticket

05:18.179 --> 05:20.630
because you didn't approve
of our organization.

05:20.768 --> 05:23.599
Me? Why, my own son's
married to a zeb...

05:25.911 --> 05:27.534
To Helen's lovely daughter.

05:28.949 --> 05:30.778
Well, I must be going.

05:30.916 --> 05:32.332
I better be going too.

05:32.470 --> 05:35.369
See you later, Louise.
Uh, fine, Helen.

05:35.507 --> 05:37.613
I'm really happy that you
both will be joining us.

05:37.751 --> 05:39.166
Oh, we'll be there, all right.

05:39.304 --> 05:40.995
Oh, there's one condition
I must insist on.

05:41.133 --> 05:42.238
What's that?

05:42.376 --> 05:44.309
That my good old friends,
the Willises,

05:44.447 --> 05:46.207
and my good new
friends, the Fletchers,

05:46.346 --> 05:48.589
will come over here for drinks
before we all go to the ball.

05:48.727 --> 05:52.352
I'm delighted.
I'm amazed.

05:52.490 --> 05:55.182
Now, all I gotta do is figure
out what I'm gonna wear.

05:55.320 --> 05:56.597
What's your husband
wearing, Mrs. Fletcher?

05:56.735 --> 05:58.737
Well, Bill always
goes as a pirate.

05:58.875 --> 06:02.948
Perfect. I never met a
good businessman who didn't
make a good pirate!

06:12.233 --> 06:13.269
Thank you.

06:22.416 --> 06:24.798
Yes, sir, what can I
do for you?

06:24.936 --> 06:27.248
Here, take these
pirate costumes, Leroy!

06:27.387 --> 06:30.942
Oh, hi, Mr. Jefferson.
You want all these cleaned?

06:31.080 --> 06:33.979
No, I don't want them
cleaned, Leroy.
I want you to listen.

06:34.117 --> 06:35.636
I don't hear anything.

06:36.810 --> 06:38.743
To me!

06:38.881 --> 06:42.229
Look, I want you back here
at the store tonight at
eight o'clock. Sharp!

06:42.367 --> 06:44.300
Eight o'clock!

06:44.438 --> 06:45.750
The store'll be closed.

06:45.888 --> 06:48.235
I know that, Leroy.
I want you to open it.

06:48.373 --> 06:49.547
Got it!

06:50.410 --> 06:52.204
I don't have a key.

06:52.342 --> 06:56.070
I know, Leroy. I'm
gonna give you a key.

06:56.208 --> 06:58.797
Now, a little after eight,
my maid Florence will
be coming down here.

06:58.935 --> 07:00.385
Well, how will I know her?

07:00.523 --> 07:02.422
There'll only be two
of you here!

07:03.837 --> 07:06.149
The one that ain't
you, is her!

07:07.357 --> 07:09.152
Got it!
Good.

07:09.290 --> 07:11.741
Now, she'll be bringing
down a pirate costume
stained with grape juice.

07:11.879 --> 07:13.363
Well, save her the trip,
Mr. Jefferson.

07:13.502 --> 07:15.089
Grape juice is
murder to get out.

07:15.227 --> 07:17.333
I know, Leroy.
You ain't gotta worry
about getting it out.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.162
I don't?

07:19.300 --> 07:20.819
No, all you gotta do is
give her one of these
clean pirate costumes.

07:20.957 --> 07:22.925
Whichever one matches
the one she brings down.
You got it?

07:23.063 --> 07:24.202
Got it!
Good.

07:24.340 --> 07:25.445
Why?

07:26.618 --> 07:28.344
Because the costume
with the stain on it

07:28.482 --> 07:31.278
belongs to a man who
owns a costume company.

07:31.416 --> 07:33.245
And we show him how fast we
are, and how good we are,

07:33.383 --> 07:34.730
maybe we can get his business.

07:34.868 --> 07:37.215
Because he'll think the
costume you bring back to him

07:37.353 --> 07:39.666
is his costume, only cleaned!

07:39.804 --> 07:41.806
Right.

07:41.944 --> 07:44.740
Oh, Mr. Jefferson,
you know, you sure are smart.

07:44.878 --> 07:47.156
I know.

07:47.294 --> 07:50.193
So why are you going upstairs
wearing all those pirate hats!

07:52.023 --> 07:54.474
Why didn't you tell me sooner?

08:17.324 --> 08:19.637
Well, Florence, how do you
like my costume?

08:19.775 --> 08:23.468
Oh, Mrs. Jefferson,
it's wonderful. Who you
supposed to be?

08:25.435 --> 08:29.405
I'll give you a clue.
Antony and...

08:29.543 --> 08:31.062
The Imperials!

08:36.412 --> 08:39.657
I just love them.
I got all their albums!

08:39.795 --> 08:43.177
Doo doo doo doo
Tears on my pillow

08:43.315 --> 08:46.456
Doo doo doo doo
Pain in my heart

08:46.595 --> 08:50.633
No, Florence.
Antony and Cleopatra.

08:50.771 --> 08:53.636
What? You mean he broke
up with the Imperials?

09:05.475 --> 09:07.339
Reach for the sky!

09:08.720 --> 09:11.930
When Black Bart tells 'em to
reach, they reach!

09:12.068 --> 09:14.795
And if Black Bart
does that again,

09:14.933 --> 09:17.418
Black Bart is gonna wind
up with a black eye!

09:19.179 --> 09:20.801
What you got to say, Florence?

09:22.044 --> 09:24.011
Oh yeah!

09:24.149 --> 09:26.876
I think you would have made a
great sheriff in the Old West.

09:27.014 --> 09:28.947
Why you'd have got rid
of all them bad guys.

09:29.085 --> 09:30.431
Yup!

09:30.570 --> 09:32.295
They would have took one
look at you and died laughing!

09:43.721 --> 09:44.791
What's this?

09:44.929 --> 09:46.827
Grape punch. I asked
Florence to make it for me.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.933
Why?
Cause we ain't had it
in a long time.

09:49.071 --> 09:51.487
We've never had grape punch.

09:51.625 --> 09:53.489
Well, you can't get no
longer than that!

09:54.697 --> 09:56.699
You better hurry up and
finish gettin dressed.

09:56.837 --> 09:58.356
I am dressed.

09:58.494 --> 10:00.185
What about your crown?

10:00.323 --> 10:02.809
Oh, it was a little
heavy so I was thinking
about not wearing it.

10:02.947 --> 10:04.465
Weezy, are you crazy?

10:04.604 --> 10:07.123
You don't stand a chance
at that Best Costume
prize without your crown.

10:07.261 --> 10:09.747
You're right. I hadn't
thought of that.

10:10.782 --> 10:12.853
Course as long as
Black Bart's in town,

10:12.991 --> 10:15.511
you don't stand
much of a chance anyway.

10:18.065 --> 10:19.895
Florence, I gotta talk.
Yeah?

10:20.033 --> 10:23.105
Look, when Mr. Fletcher
gets over here and when
he asks for a drink,

10:23.243 --> 10:25.763
I want you to get him some
of that grape juice,
and then pour it on him.

10:25.901 --> 10:27.178
I can't do that.

10:27.316 --> 10:29.456
Course you can.
You're always spilling things.

10:29.594 --> 10:32.010
I'll even pay you.
How much?

10:32.148 --> 10:33.771
Twenty-five bucks.
Forget it.

10:35.255 --> 10:37.844
Well, how much you want?
Five thousand dollars.

10:38.810 --> 10:40.640
Five thou...
But I'll take fifty!

10:41.917 --> 10:43.194
Okay, you got a deal.

10:43.332 --> 10:45.575
Now, look, after you
spill it on him, you say,

10:45.714 --> 10:48.406
"Oh, Mr. Jefferson can
get that out. He can
get anything out."

10:48.544 --> 10:49.718
And I'm gonna say, "No way."

10:49.856 --> 10:51.374
But no matter what I
say, you keep on sayin',

10:51.512 --> 10:54.205
"He can do it.
He can do it fast!"

10:54.343 --> 10:57.898
But Mr. Jefferson, grape
juice punch won't come out.

10:58.036 --> 11:00.004
Ain't nobody ask for your
kitchen philosophy!

11:01.005 --> 11:03.076
Look, you just get Fletcher
into the bathroom.

11:03.214 --> 11:05.803
Get his costume off.
Take it down to the store.

11:05.941 --> 11:08.598
Get a costume from Leroy.
Bring that one to me.
You get fifty bucks!

11:08.737 --> 11:10.600
You blow it, nothin'!

11:12.154 --> 11:14.812
I found my crown.
It was in the bathroom!

11:16.330 --> 11:17.469
Good thinkin', Weezy.

11:17.607 --> 11:19.920
A smart queen always leaves
her crown by the throne.

11:26.237 --> 11:29.447
Oh Helen, Tom!
Oh my goodness!

11:31.483 --> 11:35.142
Oh, Louise, Cleopatra
never looked so good.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.350
Thank you.

11:36.488 --> 11:38.283
But where's your asp?

11:40.665 --> 11:42.149
In back of her.

11:44.117 --> 11:45.428
Tom!
I mean.

11:45.566 --> 11:48.259
It's on the desk here, see?

11:50.054 --> 11:51.849
You look beautiful too, Helen.

11:51.987 --> 11:53.920
Who are you?
Helen.

11:54.058 --> 11:57.578
No, I mean who are
you suppo...
Helen of Troy.

11:57.717 --> 12:02.135
Good choice, your face
looks like it's been used
for launching ships!

12:03.239 --> 12:04.378
George!

12:04.516 --> 12:06.208
I didn't say it,
Black Bart said it.

12:07.934 --> 12:09.418
You look great too, Willis.

12:09.556 --> 12:11.385
Oh, heh,
thank you, George.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.249
That's pretty clever
going as a zebra.

12:16.459 --> 12:18.116
It's a convict uniform.

12:18.254 --> 12:19.669
Oh!

12:19.808 --> 12:23.570
I feel like I'm on
my way to a Johnny
Cash concert!

12:23.708 --> 12:25.986
Anybody want a drink?
I'll have a scotch and soda.

12:26.124 --> 12:27.885
Make it two.
Make that three.

12:29.127 --> 12:31.440
Three shots of red
eye coming up.

12:33.200 --> 12:34.408
Hello?

12:34.857 --> 12:35.996
Oh hi, Leroy.

12:36.134 --> 12:37.757
Hey, I'll get it, Weezy.
You fix the drinks.

12:37.895 --> 12:40.967
Oh, I'll help you, Louise.

12:41.105 --> 12:44.108
Leroy, what's the matter?
You want to go over
the plan again?

12:45.143 --> 12:46.489
Look, I'll call
you right back.

12:48.077 --> 12:49.907
I gotta make an
important business call.

12:50.045 --> 12:52.185
It'll only take a minute.

12:56.258 --> 12:57.328
Ah!

12:59.537 --> 13:01.746
Florence, we could use some
help with the drinks.

13:01.884 --> 13:02.989
Okay.

13:09.409 --> 13:10.790
Too much soda!

13:13.413 --> 13:15.035
Oh, I'll get it.

13:18.694 --> 13:21.973
Little Bo Peep has lost
her sheep, and doesn't know
where to find them...

13:22.111 --> 13:27.668
Don't worry, Little Bo Peep.
Superman will use his X-ray
eyes to find your sheep.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.707
Oh, the Fletchers.
Welcome.
Thank you.

13:31.845 --> 13:34.192
Louise, you look beautiful.

13:34.330 --> 13:36.988
Thank you!
This is my husband, Bill.

13:37.126 --> 13:38.956
Bill, this is
Louise Jefferson.

13:39.094 --> 13:40.750
Hello, Bill.
Louise.

13:40.889 --> 13:42.822
I love your costume.

13:42.960 --> 13:45.479
But your wife said you
were coming as a pirate.

13:45.617 --> 13:49.898
Well, I was.
But somebody rented all
our pirate costumes.

13:50.036 --> 13:52.383
Here you are, Mrs. Fletcher.
Oh, thank you.

13:52.521 --> 13:54.385
How 'bout you, Mr. Fletcher?
I'd love some.

13:54.523 --> 13:57.767
You know leaping over tall
buildings in a single bound
makes Superman thirsty!

13:57.906 --> 13:59.631
Superman? Oh, no!

14:03.912 --> 14:05.741
Oh my goodness!

14:15.751 --> 14:18.133
Florence, how could
you do that?

14:18.271 --> 14:20.342
Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Fletcher.

14:20.480 --> 14:22.482
Look at it, all over my S.

14:25.623 --> 14:27.452
I don't know what's the
matter with me.

14:27.590 --> 14:28.971
I guess my mind was wandering.

14:29.109 --> 14:31.215
Why don't you pack a bag
and go look for it?

14:33.010 --> 14:34.943
You're supposed to be the
master of ceremonies tonight.

14:35.081 --> 14:37.497
You can't stand up in
front of all those people
looking like that!

14:37.635 --> 14:38.774
Oh, Mr. Jefferson
can get it out,

14:38.912 --> 14:39.879
Mr. Jefferson
can get it out!

14:40.017 --> 14:41.363
No, I can't.

14:42.812 --> 14:44.021
Yes you can.

14:45.505 --> 14:48.370
Look, I said I can't
get it out, and I mean
I can't get it out!

14:48.508 --> 14:51.580
Get it?
Oh, you're just saying that.

14:53.651 --> 14:55.342
Mr. Jefferson can
clean anything.

14:55.480 --> 14:57.517
He can get it out.
He can get it out fast.

14:59.484 --> 15:01.935
But no one can
get grape juice out.

15:02.073 --> 15:04.696
That's right, Florence.
It just doesn't come out.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.319
That don't scare
Mr. Jefferson.

15:06.457 --> 15:09.011
Mr. Jefferson just
laughs at grape juice stains.

15:11.496 --> 15:12.670
Don't you Mr. Jefferson?

15:12.808 --> 15:14.223
Will you shut up?

15:14.361 --> 15:15.845
Wait a minute.

15:15.984 --> 15:20.022
A long time ago, we had a huge
grape juice stain on our rug.

15:20.160 --> 15:21.955
Helen, how did
we get rid of it?

15:22.093 --> 15:23.543
We moved.

15:24.475 --> 15:26.408
Oh, yeah, well then...

15:26.546 --> 15:29.100
I guess there's only one other
person left who can help you.

15:29.238 --> 15:32.034
Who?
"This looks like a
job for Superman!"

15:41.457 --> 15:43.666
Mr. Jefferson can get it
out. I know he can.

15:43.804 --> 15:46.773
Now, you just go right
in there and hand me out
your costume

15:46.911 --> 15:48.844
and me and Mr. Jefferson
will do the rest.

15:48.982 --> 15:50.328
Florence, don't
you understand?

15:50.466 --> 15:52.123
I can't clean it.

15:55.195 --> 15:58.785
Well George, the least
you can do is get
Mr. Fletcher a bathrobe.

15:58.923 --> 16:02.685
Yes, please! He can't go to
the costume party naked.

16:02.823 --> 16:06.103
Unless you two wanna
go as Little Bo Peep
and Little Boy Blue!

16:08.208 --> 16:11.522
Poor Bill. This is gonna
ruin the whole night for him.

16:11.660 --> 16:14.180
Oh, look, why doesn't
he take my outfit?

16:14.318 --> 16:16.492
Oh, Tom, that's so nice.

16:16.630 --> 16:21.325
And you had your heart
set on winning the prize for
the most original costume.

16:21.463 --> 16:24.224
Really, Tom? Who are
you supposed to be?

16:24.362 --> 16:26.088
Anyone who worked for Nixon!

16:28.884 --> 16:30.161
MR. FLETCHER:
Here it is!

16:30.299 --> 16:32.888
Good, now you
wait right there.

16:33.026 --> 16:33.993
Florence, where you goin'?

16:34.131 --> 16:35.511
I'm taking this down to Leroy.

16:35.649 --> 16:37.617
Forget it, Florence.
You're overdoing it,
Mr. Jefferson.

16:37.755 --> 16:39.205
Come back here!

16:39.343 --> 16:40.792
George, where are you going?

16:40.930 --> 16:42.829
Weezy, there's a man in our
bathroom with no clothes on.

16:42.967 --> 16:45.521
Don't just stand there!
Florence!

16:45.659 --> 16:48.800
Florence! I'll kill you!

16:51.217 --> 16:53.598
Aha! A citizen in distress!

16:53.736 --> 16:55.842
Hey, Florence! I'll kill you!

17:04.747 --> 17:07.578
What seems to be the
trouble, little buckaroo?

17:07.716 --> 17:09.476
Don't bother me now.
I'm busy.

17:09.614 --> 17:11.616
Hey, you're Superman!

17:11.754 --> 17:13.894
Not really, Mr. J.
It's me, Bentley.

17:14.033 --> 17:16.242
Although there is a
young lady in Scarsdale

17:16.380 --> 17:18.899
who says I'm faster
than a speeding bullet!

17:20.384 --> 17:22.075
You goin' to the
ball like that?

17:22.213 --> 17:25.009
Yes, and I must say,
I'm rather pleased with
my choice of costume.

17:25.147 --> 17:26.976
Uh-uh, it's all
wrong, Bentley!

17:27.115 --> 17:29.013
I hate to see you make
a fool of yourself.

17:29.151 --> 17:30.670
Goodness, do I
look that bad?

17:30.808 --> 17:33.604
Worse! Everybody'll
laugh at you, ha, ha, ha!

17:36.400 --> 17:38.057
See, I couldn't help it!

17:38.195 --> 17:40.438
Don't tell me I've sprung
another hole in the tights?

17:40.576 --> 17:42.475
No, no, no, it's just
you ain't the right type.

17:42.613 --> 17:44.270
Superman was American.

17:44.408 --> 17:46.893
Really? I thought he
came from outer space.

17:47.031 --> 17:49.102
His family did, but they
moved to New Jersey.

17:50.517 --> 17:53.382
Oh, well, if I don't
go as Superman,
what'll I wear?

17:53.520 --> 17:57.006
Well, you're English, ain't
you? You should dress
like somebody English.

17:57.145 --> 17:58.801
Now think hard.

17:58.939 --> 18:02.288
Now, who do you look at
and immediately say,
"Now, that's England."

18:02.426 --> 18:04.359
Ah, Mr. J.! I couldn't
go as the Queen!

18:05.567 --> 18:07.948
No, Bentley, I mean a pirate!

18:08.087 --> 18:11.020
A pirate? Well, many
of them were English.

18:11.159 --> 18:14.196
Sure they were! Running
around robbing and burning,
killing and looting...

18:14.334 --> 18:17.337
I mean, see, they were
something you can be proud of!

18:17.475 --> 18:20.271
Perhaps you're right, Mr. J.
Many of our pirates were

18:20.409 --> 18:24.448
romantic figures and certainly
typical of the adventurous
English spirit.

18:24.586 --> 18:26.553
Y'know, I like the idea.
Great!

18:26.691 --> 18:28.900
But where would I get
a pirate suit at this hour?

18:29.038 --> 18:30.799
I can get you one,
for nothing!

18:30.937 --> 18:32.835
You just go ahead and get
changed, I'll get Florence
to get it for you.

18:32.973 --> 18:34.975
Thank you, Mr. J.
A pirate, eh?

18:35.114 --> 18:37.012
"Yo-ho-ho, and a
bottle of rum!"

18:37.150 --> 18:39.014
"Fifteen men on a
dead man's chest."

18:39.152 --> 18:40.498
"Argh, Jim!"

18:43.674 --> 18:46.746
Okay, Mr. Fletcher,
we are in business.

18:46.884 --> 18:50.336
You will be master of
ceremonies, because I'm
the master cleaner!

18:50.474 --> 18:52.717
Ah, Jefferson, no one can
clean that costume in time...

18:52.855 --> 18:56.135
You have forgotten George
Jefferson, the fastest gun
in the East!

18:56.273 --> 18:59.759
George, what's going on?
Not now, Weezy.
I gotta make a call.

18:59.897 --> 19:03.832
I don't know exactly what's
happening, but I smell a rat.

19:03.970 --> 19:07.042
So do I, a little one
with spurs on his boots!

19:09.217 --> 19:10.597
Hello, Leroy?

19:10.735 --> 19:12.151
This is Mr. Jefferson.

19:12.289 --> 19:13.842
Is Florence there?

19:13.980 --> 19:16.603
The Mr. Jefferson that pays
you your checks, dummy!

19:17.742 --> 19:19.606
Who'd you think it was?

19:19.744 --> 19:21.608
Richard Pryor?

19:21.746 --> 19:24.197
No, nobody told
me that before.

19:25.819 --> 19:27.545
Now lemme speak to Florence.

19:29.616 --> 19:33.896
Hey, Florence? Look, bring
one of those pirate costumes
up to Bentley,

19:34.034 --> 19:35.657
and then you get
his Superman shirt
and bring it to me.

19:35.795 --> 19:36.899
You got it?

19:37.037 --> 19:38.177
Yeah.

19:38.315 --> 19:39.868
Look, just hurry up!

19:40.006 --> 19:42.042
George, I...
Not now, Weezy, I'm busy.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.734
George I want to know
what you're up to.

19:43.872 --> 19:48.048
Okay Fletcher, I just
talked to my man Leroy.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.050
You know that big "S" on
your Superman shirt?

19:50.189 --> 19:52.191
Well, it now stands
for "Spotless."

19:52.329 --> 19:54.020
You mean you got that
grape juice out?

19:54.158 --> 19:56.056
Florence'll be back
in a minute. You can
see for yourself.

19:56.195 --> 19:58.024
George, I don't believe it!

19:58.162 --> 20:00.095
Would I lie to the
Queen of the Nile?

20:02.028 --> 20:03.961
But you kept saying you
couldn't do it.

20:04.099 --> 20:06.619
I know that's one of
my biggest faults,
I'm too modest.

20:09.173 --> 20:12.625
And besides, I don't want
nobody to know about my new
secret process yet.

20:12.763 --> 20:13.764
What secret process?

20:14.696 --> 20:17.871
I call it "That Old
Black Magic."

20:18.009 --> 20:19.873
Well, I'll tell you one
thing, if it really works,

20:20.011 --> 20:21.530
you're the best cleaner
in the business.

20:21.668 --> 20:24.015
And the best costumes deserve
the best cleaner, right?

20:24.153 --> 20:25.845
Right!

20:25.983 --> 20:30.470
Okay, everybody, now
here's the proof. I told
you he could do it.

20:30.608 --> 20:32.403
Look, it's clean as a whistle.

20:32.541 --> 20:36.614
Mr. Jefferson,
this is remarkable.

20:36.752 --> 20:39.203
It's also twenty bucks extra!

20:39.341 --> 20:40.825
Thank you, Florence, dear!

20:47.591 --> 20:49.869
Course, ah, I still have to
work out some of the wrinkles.

20:50.007 --> 20:51.319
It's still amazing.

20:51.457 --> 20:53.321
If I didn't see it,
I wouldn't believe it.

20:53.459 --> 20:58.740
Me, either. George, I owe
you an apology. I thought
you were up to something.

20:58.878 --> 21:00.397
Weezy, when are you gonna
learn to trust me?

21:01.915 --> 21:03.986
That old black magic
has me in its spell

21:04.124 --> 21:05.988
That old black magic
that you weave so well

21:06.126 --> 21:08.543
Those icy fingers
up and down my spine

21:08.681 --> 21:11.062
Mr. Jefferson, now,
what am I supposed to
do with this shirt?

21:11.200 --> 21:13.444
You said pirate.
This is Superman.

21:13.582 --> 21:15.412
You know, I tried to ask
you on the phone, but...

21:15.550 --> 21:18.000
What shirt? That ain't
no shirt, Leroy.

21:18.138 --> 21:19.588
That's an old piece of rag.
Throw it away.

21:19.726 --> 21:23.765
Hold it, that's not an old
rag. It's a Superman shirt.

21:23.903 --> 21:25.456
Well, what do you know?

21:25.594 --> 21:27.941
Two grape stains in one day!
What a coincidence!

21:28.079 --> 21:30.634
Take it downstairs Leroy,
and give it the new
secret process!

21:30.772 --> 21:32.877
Right, Boss, the
secret process...

21:33.015 --> 21:34.914
What secret process?

21:36.778 --> 21:38.366
The one you ain't
supposed to talk about!

21:38.504 --> 21:40.264
Hold it!

21:40.402 --> 21:42.956
Look, that's my shirt, look!

21:43.094 --> 21:45.442
It is? Well, whose shirt
is that you're wearing?

21:46.374 --> 21:48.272
Where did that one come from?

21:48.410 --> 21:51.171
Yes, George. Where did
it come from?

21:58.282 --> 22:00.180
It came from Bentley.
I got it from him.

22:00.319 --> 22:01.837
I don't understand.

22:01.975 --> 22:04.978
Has Bentley gone into
the cleaning business?

22:06.428 --> 22:08.188
Why, George, why?

22:08.672 --> 22:09.707
Well...

22:09.845 --> 22:11.813
Cause I wanted to
get his business.

22:11.951 --> 22:13.884
Why didn't you just ask?

22:14.022 --> 22:16.058
Cause he could've said "no."

22:16.196 --> 22:18.854
Look, you gotta find some
way to show your customers
that you're good.

22:18.992 --> 22:21.201
But you tried to trick us,
Mr. Jefferson.

22:21.719 --> 22:23.100
Yeah, I know.

22:24.032 --> 22:25.102
Sorry, Fletcher.

22:25.240 --> 22:28.139
Why be sorry? That's how
I got where I am, too!

22:30.487 --> 22:33.455
But it's not worth it, George.
You don't need the money.

22:33.593 --> 22:35.284
It ain't the money,
it's the game.

22:35.423 --> 22:37.977
Exactly. And you're not
a winner until you
make it to the top.

22:38.115 --> 22:40.289
Yeah, that's right.
You're a good man, Jefferson,

22:40.428 --> 22:41.774
I like your spirit.

22:41.912 --> 22:43.810
Ah, well, you'd like my
cleaning even better.

22:43.948 --> 22:45.916
My cleaner is terrible!
I'm the best!

22:46.054 --> 22:47.814
He's slow!
I'm fast!

22:47.952 --> 22:49.471
He's expensive!
I'm...

22:49.609 --> 22:51.853
Not so expensive.

22:51.991 --> 22:55.235
And he never supports the
Interracial Awareness Society.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.583
What kind of bigot is he?

22:58.860 --> 23:00.620
I support it all the way!

23:00.758 --> 23:03.312
Oh, really, George?
How much have you given?

23:03.451 --> 23:04.969
How much have you given?

23:05.107 --> 23:08.145
Tom is a sustaining sponsor.
One thousand dollars.

23:08.283 --> 23:11.113
Oh, yeah? Well, Weezy and I
are both sustaining sponsors,

23:11.251 --> 23:13.046
and I'm pledging two
thousand dollars!

23:13.184 --> 23:14.841
Jefferson, I wanna give
you my business.

23:14.979 --> 23:16.878
Great!
But I can't.

23:17.016 --> 23:19.501
What?
My brother-in-law
does all our cleaning.

23:19.639 --> 23:21.227
Mrs. Fletcher would kill me.

23:21.365 --> 23:23.505
You better believe it, cookie!

23:23.643 --> 23:26.232
Oh, Fletcher, you just
gave me the business.

23:26.370 --> 23:28.234
Uh, I'm sorry, Jefferson.

23:28.372 --> 23:30.443
Can I go now,
Mr. Jefferson?

23:30.581 --> 23:33.515
You know, I ain't been
this confused since
I don't know when.

23:34.343 --> 23:35.310
Yesterday?

23:35.448 --> 23:39.314
Yeah, that's when it was!

23:39.452 --> 23:41.972
Look, bring one of
those pirate costumes
up here for Mr. Fletcher.

23:42.110 --> 23:43.698
All right, Boss.

23:47.736 --> 23:49.497
Well...

23:49.635 --> 23:52.672
George, I'm sorry you
didn't get the contract,

23:52.810 --> 23:55.123
but I hope you've
learned a lesson.

23:55.261 --> 23:58.091
I sure did, Weezy.
A big lesson.

23:58.229 --> 24:01.301
First you close the deal,
then you make the donation!

24:02.855 --> 24:05.444
But, George,
it's for a good cause.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.308
Maybe I can get
some of it back.

24:08.447 --> 24:09.655
How much do you win
for Best Costume?

24:10.310 --> 24:11.484
Five hundred dollars.

24:11.622 --> 24:12.727
Hey! That ain't bad.

24:12.865 --> 24:15.212
Huh, betcha I win, too.
Sharp as I am.

24:15.350 --> 24:17.007
Hey, watch this.

24:19.388 --> 24:21.356
Reach!

24:26.395 --> 24:28.536
Oh my goodness!

24:49.522 --> 24:51.282
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped

24:51.420 --> 24:53.319
in front of a studio audience.
