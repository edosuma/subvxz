additional violence.

12:05.183 --> 12:06.593
That suggests
a power—assertive rapist—

12:06.685 --> 12:08.550
somebody who’s obsessed
with masculinity,

12:08.645 --> 12:11.102
who needs others
to see him as a man.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.100
If Sergeant Scott
fit the profile,

12:13.191 --> 12:16.274
he would’ve reacted to my overture
with one emotion— disgust.

12:16.361 --> 12:18.022
There was no disgust,
just surprise.

12:18.113 --> 12:21.025
Correct.
Eyebrows up, jaw down.

12:21.116 --> 12:23.573
Okay. But the guy
was totally amped up.

12:23.660 --> 12:26.242
Yeah, but he showed no
deception leakage, right?
There was no sign of lying.

12:26.330 --> 12:28.412
He looked like he wanted
to throw me across the room.

12:28.498 --> 12:31.581
A man charged with rape is
even more likely to be angry
if he’s innocent.

12:31.710 --> 12:35.168
Well, they can’t both
be telling the truth.
[Cal] They’re not.

12:35.255 --> 12:38.213
Sheila Lake made
two mouth shrugs...

12:38.300 --> 12:40.211
when she was describing
the rape.

12:42.554 --> 12:47.139
That’s a classic gestural slip.
It means she has no confidence
in her words.

12:47.225 --> 12:49.352
The woman was lying.

13:00.948 --> 13:02.484
I was sexually assaulted.

13:02.574 --> 13:06.158
You really think a woman
would lie about rape?

13:06.244 --> 13:10.157
Unpleasant truths—
human mortality,
mustache on a woman.

13:10.248 --> 13:12.159
Three things we’d all
prefer to ignore.

13:12.250 --> 13:16.619

have found that eight percent
of rape allegations are false.

13:16.713 --> 13:19.455
Okay. but the army vets
I worked with at T.S.A....

13:19.549 --> 13:21.164
said that sexual assault
was a big problem.

13:21.259 --> 13:23.295
It doesn’t explain
the gestural slip.

when recounting her story.

13:29.685 --> 13:31.926
No shame, no fear.

13:32.020 --> 13:35.933

13:36.024 --> 13:37.639
But there isn’t any.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.770
Maybe she’s got
posttraumatic stress.

13:39.861 --> 13:41.772
Emotional numbing
might explain her inability
to express herfeelings.

about Sergeant Scott.

13:45.742 --> 13:50.406
You know, I once had actors
play out the testimony
from a rape case...

13:50.497 --> 13:52.408
in front of30 federal judges.

13:52.499 --> 13:55.957
You know the biggest predictor
ofwhether they believed
the man or the woman?

13:56.044 --> 13:57.955
The gender of the judge.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.458

’cause I’m a woman?

14:04.636 --> 14:07.013

it’s important...

14:07.097 --> 14:09.759

Typical vocal stress
on a typical question.

18:17.639 --> 18:19.379
That’s Taft’s vocal-stress baseline.

18:19.516 --> 18:22.974
And given how irritating
most people find you—
It’s a high-tolerance baseline.

18:23.061 --> 18:25.677
He’d have to be
extremely anxious
for his pitch to spike above it.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.728
So, applying the baseline.

18:27.816 --> 18:30.728
You can see from the spikes
that Taft had three moments
of extreme anxiety.

18:30.819 --> 18:33.652
Let me guess. That’s
when he denied bribing
our basketball phenom.

18:33.738 --> 18:36.821

- He was 16.

We have several, Major.

35:23.580 --> 35:25.741
You still want to tell me
she’s not lying?

35:33.882 --> 35:36.589
Isolate Rebecca Metz.

35:39.054 --> 35:41.670
There’s something
not right about her smile.
She doesn’t look happy.

Push in on her eyes.

35:44.101 --> 35:46.843
Brows up,
pulled together.

35:46.937 --> 35:49.314
She’s scared.
Hi.

35:49.398 --> 35:51.389
Yeah, it’s a masking smile.

35:51.483 --> 35:56.147
She’s smiling, but her eyes
say she’s afraid,
very afraid.

35:56.238 --> 35:59.696
-Wi|lyou pull up
the masking smiles?
- [ Ria ] Yeah.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.320
[ Gillian ] M/ss South Carolina

the same problem with the press.

36:04.830 --> 36:07.572
Rebecca Metz
with her pla toon leader.
[ Ria ] Right.

36:07.666 --> 36:09.406
She doesn’t want
to be involved
with Sergeant Scott.

36:09.501 --> 36:11.457
But he’s her commander.
She’s gotta do what he says.

36:11.545 --> 36:13.331
He wants sex, right?

36:13.422 --> 36:16.209
She feels forced
to give it to him.

36:16.300 --> 36:19.133
She can ’t say no.
It’s not consensual
/t’s rape.

36:19.219 --> 36:21.380
Army psychologists have reported
several recent cases like this.

36:21.472 --> 36:23.383
They’re calling it
“command rape.”

36:23.474 --> 36:26.591
It’s comparable
to sexual harassment,
but much more extreme.

36:26.685 --> 36:28.892
When your boss makes advances,
you’re scared of losing yourjob.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.595
But if it’s your platoon leader,
you’re scared of losing your life.

36:31.690 --> 36:34.807
Sergeant Scott redeploys ton/ght.
We have to get back to Fort Meade.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.863
They won’t believe
it was rape.

36:41.950 --> 36:44.566
Sergeant Scott
never raised a hand.

36:44.661 --> 36:46.743
It doesn’t matter
that he didn’t
attack you physically.

36:46.830 --> 36:51.369
- You were coerced.
- No one’s gonna
see it that way.

36:51.460 --> 36:52.870
I never actually said no.

36:52.961 --> 36:54.497
He was responsible
for your safety.

36:54.630 --> 36:56.791
You had to feel threatened.

36:56.882 --> 36:59.840
Everyone knew
ifyou crossed him,
he’d make you drive lead.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.714
- Drive lead?
- Lead truck in the convoy.

37:02.805 --> 37:06.514
It’s the most vulnerable
to a roadside bomb.

37:06.600 --> 37:08.556
I had a friend die that way.

37:08.644 --> 37:12.102
/knew from the ﬁrst time
he came in my tent
that if/ said no,

37:12.189 --> 37:13.554
I’d be driving lead
for a month.

37:13.649 --> 37:16.812
So youjust took it.
You never said no?

37:19.071 --> 37:21.312
Well, that’s what
you’ll tell Major Harris.

37:21.448 --> 37:23.154
He’ll never believe me.
Sure he will.

37:23.242 --> 37:26.325
We’ll put you on a polygraph.
They love ’em over there.

37:26.412 --> 37:29.825
- [Cal] O/I/
[ Wh/st/es]
- They’ll never see it that way.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.497
Sergeant Scott never made me drive lead,
and he’ll never admit he would have.

37:32.584 --> 37:36.293
She’s right. We still don’t
have any proofthat he was
tying her safety to sex.

37:36.380 --> 37:38.371
The truth isn’t good enough
for these people.

37:38.465 --> 37:40.956
Who said anything
about the truth?

37:43.429 --> 37:45.966

- Yes.

37:59.528 --> 38:01.484

And are you
a private ﬁrst class...

38:01.572 --> 38:03.483

38:03.574 --> 38:06.691
Yes.

Did you have a relationship
with Staff Sergeant
Russell Scott?

38:09.413 --> 38:11.119
No.

38:11.206 --> 38:14.243
Private Metz,
let me rephrase.

38:14.334 --> 38:17.622
Were you physically involved
with Staff Sergeant Scott...

38:17.713 --> 38:20.295
when you were serving
in Afghanistan?

38:20.382 --> 38:22.714
Yes. He forced me
to have sex with him.

38:22.801 --> 38:25.008
We had a relationship!

38:25.095 --> 38:27.051
[ Polygrapher]
He ordered you
to have seX with him?

38:27.139 --> 38:31.098
No, but he was
my commanding officer.
I didn’t have a choice.

38:31.185 --> 38:34.518
Did you ever
refuse to ha ve seX
with Sergeant Scott?

38:36.565 --> 38:38.806
Yes. Once.

38:40.360 --> 38:43.352
- He forced me to drive
lead convoy for a week.
- That’s a lie.

38:43.447 --> 38:46.405
Ifshe’s lying, it graphs
above the red bar here?

38:46.492 --> 38:48.653
- [ Polygrapher Continues,

- That’s right.

38:48.744 --> 38:50.860
- The machine says it’s true.
- Well, it’s not true.

38:50.954 --> 38:53.661
- The polygraph says it is.
- I don’t care what the machine says.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.240
She’s making it up!
I never made her drive lead!

38:57.586 --> 38:59.827
- You never
made her drive lead?
- No.

38:59.922 --> 39:01.787
I thought that duty rotates.
You never made her drive lead?

39:01.882 --> 39:03.747
I never made her drive lead!
It’s a lie!

39:03.842 --> 39:05.798
Sergeant, you don’t
have to respond.

39:05.886 --> 39:10.425
So as long as she was
in a relationship with you,
she never had to drive lead.

39:10.516 --> 39:11.926
- Is that right?
- Sergeant Scott.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.178
- Is that right, Sergeant Scott?
- Sergeant Scott, don’t.

- Sergeant Scott,
you don’t have to respond.

Yeah! Yeah, that’s right.

39:22.903 --> 39:25.645

Well, her safety
was in your charge.
You traded her safety for sex.

doesn’t understand the full—
- Yes, he does.

wasn ’t fra terniza tion.
It was rape.

you’re talking about.

- I’m a decorated soldier!

You want a degree.

41:23.315 --> 41:25.727
So I convinced Dr. Lightman
to put our fee into a trust.

Probably not enough
