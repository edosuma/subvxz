Announcer:
<i>Last week...</i>

00:02.772 --> 00:05.077
Watch and learn.

00:05.077 --> 00:07.147
<i>a classic</i>
<i>Gordon Ramsay dish...</i>

00:07.147 --> 00:08.584
He takes a simple egg

00:08.584 --> 00:12.091
<i>and turns it</i>
<i>into the Taj Mahal.</i>

00:12.091 --> 00:13.426
Announcer:
<i>...sent six home cooks...</i>

00:13.426 --> 00:15.097
Gordon:
His eggs looks
really runny.

00:15.097 --> 00:16.432
<i>...to the bottom</i>
<i>of the competition.</i>

00:16.432 --> 00:18.203
You'll be doing
this challenge

00:18.203 --> 00:20.173
<i>all over again.</i>

00:20.173 --> 00:23.113
‐ Please, God, please, God.
‐ <i>and when they scrambled</i>
<i>for redemption...</i>

00:23.113 --> 00:26.185
‐ ( gasps )
‐ <i>Heather cracked</i>
<i>under the pressure.</i>

00:26.185 --> 00:27.488
( coughs )

00:27.488 --> 00:29.158
Gordon:
The color is dark and gray.

00:29.158 --> 00:33.568
<i>Ending her time</i>
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

00:33.568 --> 00:35.738
<i>Tonight...</i>

00:35.738 --> 00:37.809
‐ Gordon: Lamb.
‐ Cool.

00:37.809 --> 00:41.316
<i>The top 17 have</i>
<i>front row seats</i>

00:41.316 --> 00:43.420
<i>to a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>master class.</i>

00:43.420 --> 00:45.825
Can we do this today?
This is crazy.

00:45.825 --> 00:47.328
Gordon:
<i>You've got to speed up.</i>

00:47.328 --> 00:49.365
<i>And when the competition</i>
<i>heats up,</i>

00:49.365 --> 00:50.501
<i>who has the chops...</i>

00:50.501 --> 00:52.204
‐ Whoo‐hoo!
‐ It's beautifully done.

00:52.204 --> 00:54.175
You just cook
like a chef's dream.

00:54.175 --> 00:56.112
<i>to make the cut?</i>

00:56.112 --> 00:58.249
What in the ( bleep )
happened?

01:11.376 --> 01:13.714
<i>Welcome, everybody.</i>

01:13.714 --> 01:16.052
Please make your way
to the front.
Let's go.

01:16.052 --> 01:17.522
Top 17.

01:17.522 --> 01:20.160
Being a nutritionist,
food is my passion.

01:20.160 --> 01:23.066
<i>So being able</i>
<i>to breathe and live</i>

01:23.066 --> 01:24.335
<i>in the MasterChef kitchen</i>

01:24.335 --> 01:27.074
<i>is just like</i>
<i>a dream come true.</i>

01:27.074 --> 01:28.577
It's time to get
your next challenge started.

01:28.577 --> 01:29.680
<i>Let's go.</i>

01:29.680 --> 01:31.082
I haven't been
in the bottom yet,

01:31.082 --> 01:32.719
but I haven't got
a win yet.

01:32.719 --> 01:34.790
<i>I am so tired</i>
<i>of just coasting.</i>

01:34.790 --> 01:36.860
So it's like,
time to show up
and show out.

01:36.860 --> 01:40.535
So now they're gonna find out
what Eboni is all about.

01:40.535 --> 01:43.306
Tonight, we'll be testing
all of you talented home cooks

01:43.306 --> 01:46.412
on something
extremely technical.

01:51.724 --> 01:53.460
Let's see what we got.

01:53.460 --> 01:56.265
Now, you all
are about to face

01:56.265 --> 01:58.236
what we call
a skills test.

01:58.236 --> 02:00.307
A true master chef
needs to know

02:00.307 --> 02:03.379
their way
around butchering.

02:03.379 --> 02:06.687
And on the menu tonight,
Colorado's finest...

02:11.597 --> 02:14.201
‐ lamb.
‐ Oh!

02:14.201 --> 02:16.072
<i>This one is immaculate.</i>

02:16.072 --> 02:19.211
<i>But it doesn't start out</i>
<i>like this.</i>

02:19.211 --> 02:21.048
It starts out like...

02:25.257 --> 02:26.827
this.

02:26.827 --> 02:29.131
<i>Most home cooks buy</i>
<i>their rack of lamb</i>
<i>from a butcher,</i>

02:29.131 --> 02:33.173
<i>fully prepped,</i>
<i>with all that fat</i>
<i>and membrane removed.</i>

02:33.173 --> 02:35.243
We call that Frenching.

02:35.243 --> 02:38.082
Tonight, you'll have
to French your rack of lamb

02:38.082 --> 02:40.521
<i>like a master butcher.</i>

02:40.521 --> 02:42.525
Now, I'm gonna show you
how it's done.

02:44.094 --> 02:46.499
All of you, please,
watch and learn.

02:49.639 --> 02:53.146
Now, hold
your rack of lamb up

02:53.146 --> 02:56.118
and then run your thumb
down the outside

02:56.118 --> 02:58.691
and gently peel back
that first layer

02:58.691 --> 03:00.193
of fat.

03:00.193 --> 03:02.464
From there,
place it on the board

03:02.464 --> 03:08.076
and then just very carefully,
lift the fat up and slice.

03:08.076 --> 03:10.080
Be careful.
One slip of the knife here

03:10.080 --> 03:12.585
and you've lost a finger.

03:12.585 --> 03:14.154
As I pull back this fat,

03:14.154 --> 03:18.697
you can start to see
the layers of bones exposed.

03:18.697 --> 03:21.770
Now, this is where
the real work starts.

03:21.770 --> 03:24.643
What you want to do
is separate the sinew
from the bones.

03:24.643 --> 03:28.049
So, knife goes in and down

03:28.049 --> 03:30.621
and you peel away.

03:30.621 --> 03:32.057
Turn the knife over,

03:32.057 --> 03:33.727
again, peel.

03:33.727 --> 03:35.330
This is a labor of love.

03:35.330 --> 03:40.140
Knife goes in,
twist.

03:40.140 --> 03:42.812
Get your cloth,
and this little bit
of sinew here

03:42.812 --> 03:45.818
you pull over
and down.

03:45.818 --> 03:49.158
‐ See how it's coming off?
‐ Home cooks: Yes.

03:49.158 --> 03:53.433
And then trim
that lamb beautifully.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.671
Now, once those bones
are cleaned,

03:55.671 --> 03:57.240
go around
for a second time,

03:57.240 --> 03:59.278
scrape down both sides
of the bones.

03:59.278 --> 04:03.152
And look how clean
those bones are getting..

04:03.152 --> 04:05.558
Really important to get
every little scrap,

04:05.558 --> 04:09.465
'cause if not, the bones
look dirty and unpresentable.

04:09.465 --> 04:13.406
And then finally,
this dense layer of fat

04:13.406 --> 04:14.809
needs to come off.

04:14.809 --> 04:17.749
Jason:
<i>My eyes are as wide</i>
<i>as saucers.</i>

04:17.749 --> 04:21.757
Chef Ramsay looks so smooth
and precision‐like.

04:21.757 --> 04:25.063
Everything is just moving
like a well‐oiled machine.

04:25.063 --> 04:27.234
<i>Can we do this today?</i>
<i>This is crazy.</i>

04:27.234 --> 04:28.737
Once you get
to the very end,

04:28.737 --> 04:32.177
give the bones
a final polish.

04:32.177 --> 04:37.120
And that is how you
French trim a rack of lamb
like a true master chef.

04:37.120 --> 04:40.193
( cheers )

04:43.366 --> 04:46.138
‐ Good luck.
‐ All: Thank you, chef.

04:47.575 --> 04:51.148
All right, home cooks.
Please go to your stations.

04:51.148 --> 04:53.219
Newton:
<i>As a rancher in Texas,</i>
<i>I raise cattle.</i>

04:53.219 --> 04:55.156
<i>So I know my way</i>
<i>around the knife.</i>

04:55.156 --> 04:56.593
This is gonna be
no big deal.

04:56.593 --> 04:58.564
This is like a cakewalk.

04:58.564 --> 05:00.333
I'm gonna take
these young kids out.

05:00.333 --> 05:03.172
It's time to send them
back to their millennial life

05:03.172 --> 05:06.178
with the taverns, the beer,
and hip‐hop music.

05:06.178 --> 05:08.182
Christina: <i>In front of you,</i>
<i>you each have a gorgeous,</i>

05:08.182 --> 05:09.519
raw rack of lamb.

05:09.519 --> 05:11.088
At the end
of this challenge,

05:11.088 --> 05:12.692
you should be left
with a pristine,

05:12.692 --> 05:15.063
Frenched rack of lamb,
just like Gordon's.

05:15.063 --> 05:16.700
The home cooks
that complete

05:16.700 --> 05:19.104
this skills challenge
to our standards

05:19.104 --> 05:20.406
will be safe.

05:20.406 --> 05:22.310
<i>But those that fail</i>
<i>to execute the technique</i>

05:22.310 --> 05:25.116
will immediately face
an elimination challenge

05:25.116 --> 05:28.055
where at least one of you
will be sent home tonight.

05:28.055 --> 05:30.160
You'll all have
20 minutes

05:30.160 --> 05:31.897
to perfectly butcher

05:31.897 --> 05:34.001
those incredible
racks of lamb.

05:34.001 --> 05:36.071
‐ Is everybody ready?
‐ Yes, chef.

05:36.071 --> 05:39.111
<i>Your 20 minutes</i>
<i>starts...</i>

05:39.111 --> 05:40.446
now.

05:40.446 --> 05:42.250
‐ Christina: <i>Come on, guys.</i>
‐ Gordon: Come on.

05:47.127 --> 05:49.866
<i>Now, French rack of lamb</i>
<i>is the most pristine,</i>

05:49.866 --> 05:52.872
<i>Rolls‐Royce cut of lamb</i>
<i>anywhere in the world.</i>

05:52.872 --> 05:56.378
This is something
that takes years to master
in professional kitchens.

05:56.378 --> 05:58.216
<i>Gordon, you made it</i>
<i>look easy.</i>

05:58.216 --> 05:59.953
<i>But what are</i>
<i>the potential pitfalls?</i>

05:59.953 --> 06:01.990
You have to be precise,
every cut.

06:01.990 --> 06:04.896
<i>Take too much fat off</i>
<i>and you've lost half</i>
<i>of the rack of lamb.</i>

06:04.896 --> 06:06.398
There we go.

06:06.398 --> 06:08.402
Tonight's purpose
is all about trimming it
properly,

06:08.402 --> 06:09.806
<i>finish with those</i>
<i>bones clean,</i>

06:09.806 --> 06:11.242
<i>and making sure</i>
<i>that you're left</i>

06:11.242 --> 06:13.814
<i>with 90%</i>
<i>of that cannon intact.</i>

06:17.020 --> 06:20.193
You know, in Boston,
I have not butchered
a rack of lamb.

06:20.193 --> 06:21.830
So it's not something
I'm familiar with.

06:21.830 --> 06:23.366
But my mother
grew up on a farm.

06:23.366 --> 06:25.203
I always watched her
in the kitchen growing up.

06:25.203 --> 06:27.207
And I just hope
I paid enough attention
back then,

06:27.207 --> 06:29.044
paid enough attention
just now when chef was
demonstrating.

06:29.044 --> 06:30.881
I think I'm on
the right path here.

06:30.881 --> 06:34.822
And I just have to keep
doing what I'm doing.

06:34.822 --> 06:36.225
I have cut
a rack of lamb before,

06:36.225 --> 06:37.828
it's been
a very long time.

06:37.828 --> 06:39.866
Rack of lamb was
one of my sister‐in‐law's
favorite dishes

06:39.866 --> 06:41.335
and she passed away
five years ago,

06:41.335 --> 06:42.972
so I'm doing this for her.

06:42.972 --> 06:45.209
Gordon:
<i>Guys, five minutes gone.</i>
<i>15 minutes to go.</i>

06:45.209 --> 06:47.147
Gotta be on those bones now.

06:47.147 --> 06:51.923
Come on,
you son of a bitch.

06:51.923 --> 06:53.827
Oh, my God.
There's so much fat.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.063
‐ Eboni.
‐ Yes, chef?

06:55.063 --> 06:57.100
‐ Now, do you eat lamb often?
‐ I love lamb.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.872
I cook it almost every Sunday
for my husband.

06:59.872 --> 07:01.810
But I've never
cleaned one like this.

07:01.810 --> 07:03.847
Confident you can get
yourself up on the balcony?

07:03.847 --> 07:05.116
Hopefully.
I'm hoping for that.

07:05.116 --> 07:06.820
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

07:08.824 --> 07:10.326
‐ Ah!
‐ All right, Jenny.

07:10.326 --> 07:11.896
‐ Hi, chef.
‐ I've gotta believe
you've eaten

07:11.896 --> 07:13.165
some lamb
in your day, no?

07:13.165 --> 07:14.902
‐ Nope.
‐ Not really?

07:14.902 --> 07:17.073
You seem a little frazzled,
what's going on?

07:17.073 --> 07:20.346
Um, to start with,
a French cut is a little bit
intimidating.

07:20.346 --> 07:22.818
I'm not sure what to leave
and what to take off.

07:22.818 --> 07:24.421
And we'll see how good
I can make it.

07:24.421 --> 07:26.860
Jenny, I need to see
that confidence out of you
right now.

07:26.860 --> 07:29.498
‐ Okay, please?
You can do it, all right?
‐ I know, I'm feeling kinda...

07:29.498 --> 07:30.534
‐ I know.
‐ Good luck, mama.

07:30.534 --> 07:31.870
‐ Thank you.
‐ Stick with it.

07:36.513 --> 07:39.852
‐ Right, Reba.
Have you done this before?
‐ No, sir.

07:39.852 --> 07:41.288
‐ This is my first time.
‐ Really?

07:41.288 --> 07:42.457
I've never even at lamb.

07:42.457 --> 07:44.127
‐ <i>What?</i>
‐ No.

07:44.127 --> 07:47.367
‐ Seriously?
‐ So what's the
go‐to meat that you hunt?

07:47.367 --> 07:49.271
Deer, squirrel, rabbit.

07:49.271 --> 07:51.408
‐ Squirrel? You don't eat
squirrel, do you?
‐ Yeah.

07:51.408 --> 07:53.880
What part of the squirrel
is the best bit for you then?

07:53.880 --> 07:56.118
‐ I like the squirrel legs.
‐ Squirrel legs?

07:56.118 --> 07:57.888
My uncle likes
to suck the brains.

07:57.888 --> 07:59.892
‐ He sucks the brains?
‐ Throw the head in there

07:59.892 --> 08:01.261
and just suck the brains
out of it.

08:01.261 --> 08:03.499
It's just juicy
and succulent.

08:03.499 --> 08:05.102
And it's delicious.

08:05.102 --> 08:07.508
‐ But they're vermin.
‐ I don't care, they're good.

08:07.508 --> 08:10.279
Young lady, get yourself safe
up on the balcony.

08:10.279 --> 08:11.448
<i>Good luck.</i>

08:12.450 --> 08:14.522
<i>Ten minutes remaining.</i>

08:15.858 --> 08:16.893
<i>‐ All right, Jason.</i>
<i>‐ Hi.</i>

08:16.893 --> 08:18.930
How confident are you
in this challenge?

08:18.930 --> 08:22.203
Uh, I'm a little
out of my element here.

08:22.203 --> 08:23.874
Lamb used
in Chinese cooking

08:23.874 --> 08:25.309
is always cut up
into pieces,

08:25.309 --> 08:27.380
so this is just
a very different
presentation.

08:27.380 --> 08:28.884
I just wanna
do it justice.

08:28.884 --> 08:30.486
<i>Well, you're</i>
<i>a teacher, right?</i>

08:30.486 --> 08:32.958
<i>So you know what it takes</i>
<i>to be a good student,</i>

08:32.958 --> 08:34.896
so stay focused
and good luck.

08:34.896 --> 08:35.931
Thank you, chefs.

08:37.835 --> 08:41.074
Right, Cate.
Ever French trimmed
one of these at home?

08:41.074 --> 08:44.515
‐ No. But I'm very familiar
butchering deer.
‐ <i>Right.</i>

08:44.515 --> 08:46.251
<i>You know, I grew up</i>
<i>hunting and fishing</i>

08:46.251 --> 08:47.922
and being like a wild child.

08:47.922 --> 08:49.424
How confident are you
to nail this tonight?

08:49.424 --> 08:50.827
You know what,
I'm confident,

08:50.827 --> 08:53.032
I just need to get this
Frenching technique down.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.936
‐ Good luck, young lady.
‐ Thank you, chef.

08:57.006 --> 08:58.977
Whoo‐hoo.

08:58.977 --> 09:01.281
Five minutes remaining.

09:01.281 --> 09:02.885
<i>You've got to speed up.</i>

09:02.885 --> 09:05.089
Now, guys, who do you think's
gonna really succeed?

09:05.089 --> 09:06.391
For me, Newton.

09:06.391 --> 09:08.563
You gotta believe
that him working on a ranch

09:08.563 --> 09:10.066
can be a huge advantage
for Newton.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.805
So I'm looking
for big things from him.

09:12.805 --> 09:14.441
Reba's is incredible.

09:14.441 --> 09:15.811
And Reba's
never done it before.

09:15.811 --> 09:18.082
Those bones are
immaculate, guys.

09:18.082 --> 09:20.019
Now there are some
home cooks out there

09:20.019 --> 09:21.789
that are definitely
struggling.

09:21.789 --> 09:24.762
Yeah. Sam, he's had
some serious struggles
in this kitchen.

09:24.762 --> 09:26.098
His confidence seems down.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.937
I'm really concerned
that it might get
the best of him.

09:28.937 --> 09:30.807
Christina:
<i>I'm worried about Jennifer.</i>

09:30.807 --> 09:31.943
Come on, Jennifer.
Please.

09:31.943 --> 09:32.978
She looks
all over the place.

09:32.978 --> 09:34.447
Messy board, messy knife.

09:34.447 --> 09:39.124
I agree, she's kind
of just hacking at the lamb.

09:39.124 --> 09:42.130
<i>All right, guys,</i>
<i>you have just 60 seconds.</i>

09:42.130 --> 09:45.302
<i>You want your rack of lamb</i>
<i>to be beautiful enough</i>

09:45.302 --> 09:47.140
<i>to bring you to the safety</i>
<i>of the balcony.</i>

09:49.310 --> 09:50.881
Come on, Eboni.
Let's push.

09:50.881 --> 09:55.156
Gordon: <i>Use your cloth.</i>
<i>Come on, guys, you can do this.</i>

09:55.156 --> 09:59.164
‐ Christina:
<i>Polish those bones.</i>
‐ Push, Caitlin.

09:59.164 --> 10:00.399
Gordon:
<i>Finishing touches.</i>
<i>Let's go.</i>

10:00.399 --> 10:03.272
Judges:
<i>Ten, nine, eight,</i>

10:03.272 --> 10:06.178
<i>seven, six, five,</i>

10:06.178 --> 10:09.852
<i>four, three, two, one.</i>

10:09.852 --> 10:11.956
‐ Stop. Hands in the air.
‐ <i>Hands in the air.</i>

10:18.870 --> 10:21.241
<i>You want your rack of lamb</i>
<i>to be beautiful enough</i>

10:21.241 --> 10:23.112
to bring you to the safety
of the balcony, guys.

10:23.112 --> 10:24.548
Let's go.

10:24.548 --> 10:28.957
Judges:
<i>Five, four, three,</i>
<i>two, one.</i>

10:28.957 --> 10:32.564
Stop. Hands in the air.

10:32.564 --> 10:35.169
Wow. Well done.

10:35.169 --> 10:36.939
It's time to find out
who did enough

10:36.939 --> 10:40.412
to get themselves safe
up there on the balcony.

10:47.995 --> 10:50.432
Jason. You're a teacher,
you work with numbers
and grades

10:50.432 --> 10:52.003
‐ all the time, right?
‐ Yes.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.474
‐ How do you think you did?
‐ I think I did, probably,

10:54.474 --> 10:57.346
92%.

10:57.346 --> 11:01.087
A 92%?

11:01.087 --> 11:04.562
Jason, you're selling
yourself short.

11:04.562 --> 11:07.233
This is more like a 98.
All right?

11:07.233 --> 11:10.339
It has the right ratio
of meat to bone.

11:10.339 --> 11:12.911
<i>The way that you brought</i>
<i>down all of the fat</i>

11:12.911 --> 11:15.416
<i>right to the perimeter</i>
<i>of the cannon or the eye.</i>

11:15.416 --> 11:16.819
Unbelievable job.

11:16.819 --> 11:18.957
My man, you are
definitely safe.

11:18.957 --> 11:21.328
‐ Please go upstairs.
‐ Thank you very much.
Thank you.

11:21.328 --> 11:24.835
98% from chef Sánchez.
I mean, come on, for real?

11:24.835 --> 11:26.873
‐ Look at that eye.
‐ Very good.

11:26.873 --> 11:29.277
To know that I got
a nice passing grade

11:29.277 --> 11:30.513
and I'm up to the balcony,

11:30.513 --> 11:35.456
that's the best
feeling ever.

11:35.456 --> 11:36.859
<i>Jennifer.</i>
<i>Describe your performance</i>

11:36.859 --> 11:38.195
because it looked like
you were struggling.

11:38.195 --> 11:39.531
I was struggling
a little bit,

11:39.531 --> 11:41.969
but I feel like
that I've paid a lot
of attention,

11:41.969 --> 11:43.171
and I tried my best.

11:43.171 --> 11:45.009
So let's cut straight
to the chase.

11:45.009 --> 11:47.881
Those bones look terrible.

11:47.881 --> 11:49.317
There's still meat
on the bone.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.021
They are caked in sinew.

11:51.021 --> 11:53.893
And you haven't focused
on cleaning any of those bones.

11:53.893 --> 11:58.503
‐ Yes, I‐‐
‐ That does not look like
the Rolls‐Royce of lamb.

11:58.503 --> 12:01.374
‐ That looks like
a dog chew.
‐ Yes, chef.

12:01.374 --> 12:04.882
You are definitely not
heading up on the balcony.

12:04.882 --> 12:06.484
I understand.

12:10.794 --> 12:12.229
Sam, how do you think
you did?

12:12.229 --> 12:15.069
<i>I did my best.</i>
<i>I got all of the fat off,</i>
<i>I believe.</i>

12:15.069 --> 12:18.308
I would've liked to have
gotten the bones cleaner.

12:20.814 --> 12:23.418
Well, it's very uneven.

12:23.418 --> 12:25.523
It's been completely
hacked up over there.

12:25.523 --> 12:27.159
You can see the grooves
from your knife

12:27.159 --> 12:28.328
as you were sawing.

12:28.328 --> 12:29.497
That's right.

12:29.497 --> 12:30.499
This doesn't
cut the mustard.

12:30.499 --> 12:31.869
You are not safe.

12:31.869 --> 12:33.005
( sighs )

12:36.846 --> 12:38.516
All right, Cate,
how do you think you did?

12:38.516 --> 12:40.920
Um, I'm happy,
it's presentable.

12:40.920 --> 12:43.025
But I don't think
I'm the best butcher yet.

12:43.025 --> 12:44.227
You know,
I'm like a tomboy,

12:44.227 --> 12:46.031
I'm kinda rough
around the edges.

12:46.031 --> 12:48.068
Well, Cate, I gotta say,

12:48.068 --> 12:50.907
there's nothing
rough around the edges
about your butchery.

12:50.907 --> 12:55.449
‐ This is a gorgeous,
gorgeous rack of lamb.
‐ Oh, jeez, thanks.

12:55.449 --> 12:57.253
It's incredibly impressive.

12:57.253 --> 12:58.623
Thank you so much.

12:58.623 --> 13:01.327
Look at that beautiful
cannon there.

13:01.327 --> 13:04.067
Great job with those bones.
They're polished.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.539
That is the closest
rack of lamb I've seen

13:06.539 --> 13:07.908
to Gordon's all night.

13:07.908 --> 13:09.878
‐ You are safe.
‐ Thank you.

13:09.878 --> 13:13.385
‐ Head up to the balcony.
‐ First girl. I'm coming, guys.

13:13.385 --> 13:15.189
Beautiful. I mean,
literally, textbook.

13:16.191 --> 13:19.030
‐ Hey.
‐ Jason: Yay.

13:19.030 --> 13:23.271
Eboni. You said this was
the highlight of any Sunday
lunch for your man.

13:23.271 --> 13:24.942
It is.

13:24.942 --> 13:27.948
Honestly, you've just taken
the most expensive cut of lamb

13:27.948 --> 13:30.285
‐ anywhere in the world...
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:30.285 --> 13:31.922
and made it look
the cheapest.

13:31.922 --> 13:33.559
Even the bones
aren't cleaned.

13:33.559 --> 13:36.131
‐ What happened?
‐ I was trying to take
my time too much.

13:36.131 --> 13:38.335
That's not French trimmed.

13:38.335 --> 13:40.439
That's French screwed.

13:40.439 --> 13:42.844
‐ Stay where you are,
young lady.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

13:42.844 --> 13:44.982
Eboni:
<i>I cannot believe</i>
<i>that I messed up</i>

13:44.982 --> 13:48.488
on something that I cook
almost every week.

13:48.488 --> 13:50.960
<i>I just want to crawl</i>
<i>under a rock right now.</i>

13:50.960 --> 13:52.797
'Cause now I gotta
face elimination,

13:52.797 --> 13:55.369
and this sucks.

13:55.369 --> 13:58.543
‐ Jeff, it's good.
You are safe.
‐ Thank you.

13:58.543 --> 14:00.847
‐ Brien, you're safe.
Congratulations.
‐ Thank you, chefs.

14:00.847 --> 14:02.717
Please head up
to the balcony.

14:02.717 --> 14:04.287
Gabriel, you should be
very proud of yourself.

14:04.287 --> 14:05.924
<i>That's one of</i>
<i>the best ones</i>
<i>we've seen.</i>

14:05.924 --> 14:07.393
<i>Head on up</i>
<i>to the balcony.</i>

14:07.393 --> 14:09.965
‐ Great job.
‐ Thank you, chef.

14:09.965 --> 14:11.835
Christina:
<i>That's a lot of fat</i>
<i>right there.</i>

14:11.835 --> 14:15.843
Caitlin, I'm afraid
to say you're not safe.

14:15.843 --> 14:17.948
Aarón:
<i>Daniel, those bones</i>
<i>are immaculate.</i>

14:17.948 --> 14:20.085
‐ You are safe.
‐ Thank you very much, chef.

14:21.287 --> 14:23.258
It's like you
were hacking at it.

14:23.258 --> 14:24.928
What's happened to you?

14:24.928 --> 14:26.164
I wasn't in
the game today, chef,

14:26.164 --> 14:27.534
and obviously
this proves it.

14:27.534 --> 14:29.838
Christina:
Jenny, you're staying here.

14:34.982 --> 14:37.319
Gordon:
Yachecia, you know...

14:37.319 --> 14:39.825
I mean, that is...

14:39.825 --> 14:41.895
textbook.

14:41.895 --> 14:44.968
Bones are clean.
You've got the cannon
beautifully round.

14:44.968 --> 14:46.471
When you see something
that beautiful,

14:46.471 --> 14:47.807
before it's even cooked,

14:47.807 --> 14:49.978
can you imagine
what that looks like

14:49.978 --> 14:52.149
when it comes out of
the oven and hits the table?

14:52.149 --> 14:54.086
‐ You're beyond safe.
‐ Thank you, chef.

14:54.086 --> 14:56.190
‐ Thank you so much.
‐ Head on upstairs.

14:57.927 --> 14:59.430
Reba, how'd you do?

14:59.430 --> 15:01.535
I don't think
I done too bad
for my first time.

15:01.535 --> 15:03.104
Gotta tell you, Reba,

15:03.104 --> 15:05.175
in all the weeks I've seen
you cook in this kitchen,

15:05.175 --> 15:07.146
<i>I've never seen you</i>
<i>so comfortable before.</i>

15:07.146 --> 15:09.885
‐ Thank you, ma'am.
‐ That's definitely one
of the best of the night.

15:09.885 --> 15:12.289
You are safe.
Please head up
to the balcony.

15:12.289 --> 15:13.959
‐ Good job.
‐ Nice job.

15:13.959 --> 15:15.830
<i>Yay, Reba!</i>

15:17.801 --> 15:19.036
Way to go, Reba.

15:26.050 --> 15:27.086
Aarón:
<i>You're a ranch owner.</i>

15:27.086 --> 15:28.522
You see animals
all the time, right?

15:28.522 --> 15:29.858
Yes, sir.

15:29.858 --> 15:32.931
Presentation of this lamb
is so crucial,

15:32.931 --> 15:35.035
to deliver
that "wow" factor.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.106
<i>Newton...</i>

15:37.106 --> 15:39.845
<i>it's a mess.</i>

15:39.845 --> 15:41.882
I mean, what did
that rack of lamb do to you?

15:41.882 --> 15:44.086
It's one of the most difficult
challenges I've been in.

15:45.857 --> 15:47.025
Oof.

15:47.025 --> 15:48.863
Aarón:
I think I need
glue for that.

15:48.863 --> 15:51.067
I just got too much of
the fat off around the bones

15:51.067 --> 15:52.302
or something
when I was cleaning.

15:52.302 --> 15:54.140
But it's rough
as a night in jail.

15:54.140 --> 15:56.377
"Rough as a night
in jail."

15:56.377 --> 15:58.081
Well, there's
one thing right.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.022
That's a crime.

16:11.842 --> 16:14.848
‐ I think I need glue for that.
‐ I just got too much
of the fat off

16:14.848 --> 16:15.883
around the bones
or something.

16:15.883 --> 16:17.352
I thought you were
gonna nail this.

16:17.352 --> 16:19.023
<i>It's too heavy‐handed.</i>

16:19.023 --> 16:20.793
Newton,
I think you know,

16:20.793 --> 16:22.095
with that kind
of performance,

16:22.095 --> 16:23.799
you're not safe.
You're staying right here.

16:23.799 --> 16:25.937
‐ I'm sorry, Newton.
‐ Thank you, chef.

16:28.876 --> 16:31.314
I'm just‐‐
my head's a‐spinning.

16:31.314 --> 16:33.418
<i>I mean, this should've</i>
<i>been a cake walk.</i>

16:33.418 --> 16:36.157
<i>I just turned</i>
<i>this great piece of meat</i>

16:36.157 --> 16:38.228
<i>into horse manure.</i>

16:38.228 --> 16:40.232
And I'm starting to have
a lot of self‐doubt.

16:42.570 --> 16:44.406
To all 11
of you up there,

16:44.406 --> 16:46.110
we were
thoroughly impressed,

16:46.110 --> 16:47.747
<i>and all of you</i>
<i>are safe tonight.</i>

16:47.747 --> 16:51.287
Two of you in particular
really impressed us
with your technique.

16:51.287 --> 16:53.826
<i>Those two</i>
<i>home cooks are...</i>

16:53.826 --> 16:55.763
Cate...

16:55.763 --> 16:57.332
and Yachecia.

16:57.332 --> 16:58.769
‐ <i>Well done.</i>
‐ Thank you.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.606
‐ Thank you, thank you.
‐ ( cheers, applause )

17:00.606 --> 17:02.109
‐ Thank you.
‐ Stellar job.

17:02.109 --> 17:03.779
Thank you, chef.

17:03.779 --> 17:06.284
Christina:
<i>Six of you remain</i>
<i>down here at your stations.</i>

17:06.284 --> 17:08.556
<i>We will say goodbye</i>
<i>to at least one of you tonight.</i>

17:08.556 --> 17:12.296
Please, all of you,
down to the front.

17:12.296 --> 17:16.237
I'm not used to being
at the bottom of anything
I do in life.

17:16.237 --> 17:18.341
I'm usually one
that excels to the top,

17:18.341 --> 17:20.580
<i>so I feel very vulnerable,</i>

17:20.580 --> 17:22.416
but I'm ready to step up
to the challenge.

17:22.416 --> 17:24.119
You all now are gonna
have to take

17:24.119 --> 17:26.123
the rack of lamb
that you butchered

17:26.123 --> 17:29.430
and turn it into
not just a dish

17:29.430 --> 17:30.766
worthy of this kitchen,

17:30.766 --> 17:33.371
<i>but a dish worthy</i>
<i>of any of my restaurants.</i>

17:43.291 --> 17:44.393
All of you
will be making...

17:46.565 --> 17:49.638
my delicious
herb‐crusted rack of lamb

17:49.638 --> 17:51.541
<i>with potato fondant,</i>
<i>honey‐glazed carrots,</i>

17:51.541 --> 17:54.313
<i>and an incredible</i>
<i>red wine sauce.</i>

17:54.313 --> 17:56.718
<i>Now, I'm going</i>
<i>to show all of you</i>

17:56.718 --> 17:59.490
<i>how to replicate</i>
<i>this intricate dish.</i>

17:59.490 --> 18:01.160
Watch and learn.

18:02.462 --> 18:03.666
Start off with the oil,

18:03.666 --> 18:06.203
and get that pan
really nice and hot, okay?

18:06.203 --> 18:07.272
<i>With a herb‐crusted</i>
<i>rack of lamb,</i>

18:07.272 --> 18:09.109
you cannot
season after it,

18:09.109 --> 18:11.515
so you need to season it
right at the very beginning.

18:11.515 --> 18:15.288
Salt and pepper.
Season it generously,
both sides.

18:15.288 --> 18:18.361
Make sure the rack of lamb
is seasoned throughout.

18:18.361 --> 18:21.300
There. As the oil
comes up to temp...

18:22.469 --> 18:25.241
...start to sear
this beautiful rack of lamb.

18:25.241 --> 18:26.812
Garlic in,

18:26.812 --> 18:30.485
and then in with
this fresh, fragrant thyme.

18:30.485 --> 18:32.322
Don't over‐sear the lamb.

18:32.322 --> 18:34.527
<i>So nice, gentle color.</i>

18:34.527 --> 18:36.497
Searing in the ends,

18:36.497 --> 18:39.103
locking in
all that flavor.

18:39.103 --> 18:41.107
And then from there,
lay out your thyme,

18:41.107 --> 18:43.679
and your garlic,

18:43.679 --> 18:46.618
and you literally
sit that on top.

18:46.618 --> 18:47.854
That acts as a trivet.

18:47.854 --> 18:49.123
Beautiful.

18:49.123 --> 18:51.460
Couple of knobs of butter.

18:51.460 --> 18:53.264
<i>As the butter</i>
<i>starts to melt,</i>

18:53.264 --> 18:57.272
then tilt the pan
and baste.

18:57.272 --> 18:58.542
What does that do?

18:58.542 --> 19:00.145
Moistens it, keeps it
from drying out.

19:00.145 --> 19:01.247
Exactly that.

19:01.247 --> 19:02.382
Eboni:
<i>Chef Ramsay is cooking</i>

19:02.382 --> 19:04.052
<i>right in front of my face.</i>

19:04.052 --> 19:06.090
This is, like,
phenomenal.

19:06.090 --> 19:09.731
We're gonna cook that
in the oven now
for four minutes.

19:09.731 --> 19:11.200
<i>I'm literally blinking</i>

19:11.200 --> 19:14.173
like I'm taking snapshots
of him, doing this demo

19:14.173 --> 19:17.445
so I can remember every step
exactly how he did it.

19:17.445 --> 19:20.619
Now, once the lamb
is parcooked,

19:20.619 --> 19:22.523
as it's still
nice and warm,

19:22.523 --> 19:25.228
the secret now
is to get your brush.

19:25.228 --> 19:26.765
and you've got
your Dijon mustard,

19:26.765 --> 19:28.535
and you brush
while it's warm,

19:28.535 --> 19:30.873
with that mustard,
so the mustard seeps in,

19:30.873 --> 19:34.246
and literally
almost tenderizes
the lamb even more.

19:34.246 --> 19:36.150
Here I've got
panko breadcrumbs,

19:36.150 --> 19:38.722
parmesan cheese,
salt, pepper,
and fresh basil.

19:38.722 --> 19:40.726
From there,
take your lamb,

19:40.726 --> 19:44.567
roll up, and you roll
all the way along.

19:44.567 --> 19:47.405
Tilt... tilt,

19:47.405 --> 19:49.611
and shake off
any excess breadcrumbs.

19:49.611 --> 19:51.648
Place it back
into the pan,

19:51.648 --> 19:54.687
and then back into the oven
for four more minutes.

19:54.687 --> 19:56.791
From there,
we get our garnish plate.

19:56.791 --> 19:58.127
This is a fondant potato.

19:58.127 --> 19:59.831
Potato's peeled,
cut out with a cutter,

19:59.831 --> 20:01.433
into a pan,
hot heat.

20:01.433 --> 20:02.870
As they color,
you turn them over,

20:02.870 --> 20:05.275
put some stock in,
and they go in the oven.

20:05.275 --> 20:07.513
Braised carrots,
you can all do that
with your eyes closed.

20:07.513 --> 20:09.717
‐ What's the hero tonight?
‐ All: The lamb.

20:09.717 --> 20:12.122
Four minutes later,

20:12.122 --> 20:13.692
take this out.

20:14.794 --> 20:16.297
And you let it rest.

20:16.297 --> 20:18.467
What happens when
we slice meat piping hot?

20:18.467 --> 20:20.305
Juices run out of it
and it becomes dry.

20:20.305 --> 20:21.808
Yeah.

20:23.144 --> 20:25.181
Now, I take my bone,
open that up there,

20:25.181 --> 20:27.820
and I'll come in here,
'cause I want one nice,
beautiful chop.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.724
I go down.
I come off.

20:29.724 --> 20:31.594
And I place
onto the plate.

20:31.594 --> 20:32.930
Come to the second
one here.

20:32.930 --> 20:35.502
One clean,
straight slice.

20:35.502 --> 20:37.673
Shake off any excess,
and on.

20:37.673 --> 20:39.877
This bone here,
too thin,

20:39.877 --> 20:43.250
so I come round,
I take that off.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.554
That's for my bulldog.

20:44.554 --> 20:46.190
<i>I come back up,</i>

20:46.190 --> 20:48.461
and I cut
all the way
through again.

20:48.461 --> 20:50.699
‐ Third one. Now...
‐ Beautiful, chef.

20:50.699 --> 20:54.272
...finally,
you take your sauce...

20:54.272 --> 20:57.880
and you sauce very carefully
around the plate,

20:57.880 --> 21:01.654
and just over the actual bone,
not on that crust.

21:01.654 --> 21:04.226
And there you have
a beautiful, stunning,

21:04.226 --> 21:06.430
<i>crusted rack of lamb</i>
<i>with fondant potatoes</i>

21:06.430 --> 21:07.432
<i>and glazed carrots.</i>

21:07.432 --> 21:10.038
( applause )

21:10.038 --> 21:11.674
Thank you.

21:11.674 --> 21:14.446
Now, please, all of you,
head back to your stations.
Thank you.

21:14.446 --> 21:17.352
Now I gotta recreate
one of Gordon Ramsay's dishes.

21:17.352 --> 21:20.224
He doesn't get Michelin stars
for throwing out horse manure.

21:20.224 --> 21:23.532
And I gotta use
this piece of meat that
I've kind of macerated.

21:23.532 --> 21:25.201
There's not much meat
left on the bone.

21:25.201 --> 21:28.307
I need a miracle
just to survive this.

21:28.307 --> 21:30.378
At your stations,
you'll find everything
you need

21:30.378 --> 21:32.550
<i>to make Gordon's</i>
<i>stunning lamb dish.</i>

21:32.550 --> 21:34.754
You have just
60 minutes, guys,

21:34.754 --> 21:37.626
to pull off this extremely
technical, complicated dish.

21:37.626 --> 21:39.496
‐ Is everybody ready?
‐ All: Yes, chef.

21:39.496 --> 21:43.237
60 minutes starts...

21:43.237 --> 21:45.408
‐ ...now.
‐ Woman: <i>Let's go, guys.</i>

21:45.408 --> 21:47.613
Man: <i>You can</i>
<i>do this, guys.</i>

21:47.613 --> 21:49.349
Clean this up.

21:50.919 --> 21:51.921
Looking good, Jenny.

21:51.921 --> 21:53.658
I've never made
rack of lamb before.

21:53.658 --> 21:55.261
I've never had
rack of lamb before,

21:55.261 --> 21:56.931
so I'm definitely getting
out of my comfort zone.

21:56.931 --> 21:59.369
I don't think I've
been in my comfort zone
this whole competition,

21:59.369 --> 22:01.206
but I'm not going out
without a fight.

22:03.244 --> 22:04.547
This seems like
a daunting task,

22:04.547 --> 22:06.551
to be able to recreate
one of your signature dishes

22:06.551 --> 22:09.222
after they've already
jumbled up a little bit
of their lamb rack.

22:09.222 --> 22:10.893
I'm worried
that this might be
too much, Gordon.

22:10.893 --> 22:12.462
The saving grace tonight
is that they

22:12.462 --> 22:13.832
<i>have double</i>
<i>the amount of lamb</i>
<i>in front of them</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:15.736
<i>than they actually need</i>
<i>to put on a plate.</i>

22:15.736 --> 22:19.276
<i>Eight bones in each rack.</i>
<i>They only need</i>
<i>three stunning cutlets.</i>

22:19.276 --> 22:21.413
So you can bounce back
with this.

22:23.150 --> 22:26.591
20 minutes gone.
Just under 40 minutes
remaining.

22:28.762 --> 22:31.701
‐ Eboni, how you feeling?
‐ Yes, chef. I'm okay, chef.

22:31.701 --> 22:34.139
‐ I'm amazed you're down here,
you know that.
‐ I know. Me too.

22:34.139 --> 22:36.611
<i>This is a protein</i>
<i>that you cook every week</i>
<i>for your husband.</i>

22:36.611 --> 22:40.284
My husband have a fit, I go
home on the lamb challenge.
That might be a divorce.

22:40.284 --> 22:41.888
You're more confident about
the cooking of it, yes?

22:41.888 --> 22:43.625
I always cook mine
pretty rare,

22:43.625 --> 22:45.194
so I think
I'm okay with that.

22:45.194 --> 22:47.365
I'm concerned with
making the plate look
as good as yours

22:47.365 --> 22:49.202
and making sure
all my flavors are there.

22:49.202 --> 22:50.539
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

22:52.876 --> 22:54.179
Yachecia:
Come on, Sam.

22:54.179 --> 22:55.649
Sam, how we feeling
over here, buddy?

22:55.649 --> 22:57.686
I'm pretty good.
I've prepped all
of my vegetables,

22:57.686 --> 22:59.557
I've seasoned my lamb.

22:59.557 --> 23:02.663
I've cleaned these three
a fair amount more.

23:02.663 --> 23:04.165
You'll have enough meat

23:04.165 --> 23:06.370
to give me three
beautiful medallions
of lamb.

23:06.370 --> 23:07.840
‐ That's the idea.
‐ Are you confident?

23:07.840 --> 23:09.810
‐ I am confident.
‐ I need you to step back.

23:09.810 --> 23:12.315
‐ Come on, man.
‐ All right, I'm doing it.
I'm doing it!

23:12.315 --> 23:13.785
‐ Good.
‐ Reba: Yeah,
let's go, Sam!

23:13.785 --> 23:14.787
Whoo!

23:14.787 --> 23:16.290
Right.
How you doing?

23:16.290 --> 23:18.795
Pretty good.
Little embarrassed
about my performance.

23:18.795 --> 23:21.567
I'm a rancher.
You know, you'd think
I'd know my way around

23:21.567 --> 23:23.672
a skills contest
with the lamb.

23:23.672 --> 23:26.511
Didn't work out that way,
so it's all about redemption
for me right now.

23:26.511 --> 23:28.147
Are you confident
you can pull this off?

23:28.147 --> 23:29.149
‐ I am.
‐ You are.

23:29.149 --> 23:30.552
Do I have that
fight in you?

23:30.552 --> 23:31.988
‐ You do have that fight in me.
‐ I want to see it.

23:31.988 --> 23:33.992
‐ I want to see you
nail it, okay?
‐ Fair enough.

23:33.992 --> 23:36.664
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

23:36.664 --> 23:39.269
Gordon:
Just under 30 minutes
to go, guys.

23:39.269 --> 23:41.440
Where's the...

23:41.440 --> 23:43.177
( groans )

23:43.177 --> 23:45.549
Jennifer, there's time.
You don't need
to be frazzled.

23:45.549 --> 23:47.251
Jennifer looks like
she's over her head.

23:47.251 --> 23:48.621
Oh, dear.

23:48.621 --> 23:52.295
I did forget
the ( bleep ) cheese, though.

23:52.295 --> 23:53.598
Cate:
<i>Jen, deep breaths,</i>
<i>you got it.</i>

23:53.598 --> 23:56.303
<i>Jennifer isn't</i>
<i>the best under pressure,</i>

23:56.303 --> 24:00.244
and she gets frazzled
in the kitchen
all the time.

24:03.417 --> 24:05.555
My biggest demon
in this competition

24:05.555 --> 24:09.830
<i>is my memory,</i>
<i>trying my best to remember</i>
<i>every step</i>

24:09.830 --> 24:11.701
<i>that Chef Ramsay had said.</i>

24:11.701 --> 24:15.174
<i>And if I don't,</i>
<i>that's it for me.</i>
<i>I could be going home.</i>

24:18.113 --> 24:19.884
She is a flurry.

24:19.884 --> 24:22.255
Oh, God.
I can't watch that.

24:22.255 --> 24:24.693
I'm worried she's
gonna crumble.

24:31.707 --> 24:32.709
Ugh.

24:34.747 --> 24:37.218
I'm worried
she's gonna crumble.

24:37.218 --> 24:40.792
Oh, God.
I can't watch that.

24:40.792 --> 24:43.230
Jennifer, look at me.
You can do this.

24:43.230 --> 24:45.167
Listen, you do your best
when you're focused,

24:45.167 --> 24:46.904
<i>and when you're confident.</i>

24:46.904 --> 24:49.342
This doesn't have
to be your last night
in this kitchen, okay?

24:49.342 --> 24:50.612
I don't want it to be.

24:50.612 --> 24:52.649
What are you worried about
in terms of this dish?

24:52.649 --> 24:54.285
When do I put
this lamb on?

24:54.285 --> 24:55.789
<i>Like, my mind</i>
<i>is like, "Do it now."</i>

24:55.789 --> 24:57.191
Okay, so let's
talk through it.

24:57.191 --> 24:59.195
How long does it need
to sear the first time?

24:59.195 --> 25:00.331
Two minutes,
not even.

25:00.331 --> 25:01.366
And then what
happens next?

25:01.366 --> 25:03.136
You put it in the oven
for four minutes,

25:03.136 --> 25:05.374
and then take it out,
and then you mustard
encrust it

25:05.374 --> 25:07.211
and then put it in there
for four minutes.

25:07.211 --> 25:08.882
You got it.
Nice job.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.253
Don't let that other voice
in your head get you.

25:11.253 --> 25:12.656
I believe in you.

25:12.656 --> 25:15.261
‐ You can do this.
‐ I appreciate it, thank you.

25:15.261 --> 25:16.296
Daniel: <i>Let's go, Jen!</i>

25:16.296 --> 25:17.833
Let's go, Jennifer!

25:17.833 --> 25:20.271
‐ <i>Let's go, Jen!</i>
‐ <i>Come on, Jennifer!</i>

25:25.281 --> 25:26.751
Miss Caitlin,
talk to me.

25:26.751 --> 25:28.588
You eat a lot
of lamb and meat, right?

25:28.588 --> 25:31.192
I eat a lot of meat,
but not a lot of lamb.

25:31.192 --> 25:32.996
I normally consider it
pretty far out of my budget.

25:32.996 --> 25:34.265
Really? Okay, well,

25:34.265 --> 25:35.467
<i>are you feeling good</i>
<i>about everything?</i>

25:35.467 --> 25:36.804
<i>I'm feeling okay</i>
<i>so far.</i>

25:36.804 --> 25:38.975
I'm just gonna focus
on the task at hand

25:38.975 --> 25:41.146
<i>and make sure I don't</i>
<i>overcook tonight's lamb.</i>

25:41.146 --> 25:43.183
All right, make sure
that your timing
is concise,

25:43.183 --> 25:45.220
‐ Yes, chef.
‐ <i>And you deserve</i>
<i>not to be in the bottom,</i>

25:45.220 --> 25:47.626
‐ but where?
‐ I deserve to be
on the balcony tonight.

25:47.626 --> 25:49.630
Aarón:
<i>Okay, show us</i>
<i>you can do it.</i>

25:49.630 --> 25:51.466
Gordon:
<i>Guys, just under</i>
<i>ten minutes to go.</i>

25:51.466 --> 25:53.470
<i>Sauce should be reducing.</i>

25:53.470 --> 25:55.207
Carrots, potatoes,
coming together.

25:57.378 --> 25:58.514
Gordon:
Wow, it's intense.

25:58.514 --> 26:00.351
Eboni is a little bit
down in the dumps.

26:00.351 --> 26:02.121
This is the rack of lamb
that she cooks

26:02.121 --> 26:04.593
<i>for her family</i>
<i>every Sunday,</i>
<i>but she never trims it.</i>

26:04.593 --> 26:07.198
<i>I'm just hoping</i>
<i>that she doesn't get</i>
<i>herself into a muddle</i>

26:07.198 --> 26:09.102
with the cooking
of that lamb.

26:09.102 --> 26:12.441
My concern is
that Sam's crust
looks very separated.

26:12.441 --> 26:14.647
It's not emulsified.
It has too much
bread crumb in it.

26:14.647 --> 26:15.649
( sighs )

26:15.649 --> 26:18.120
Two and half
minutes to go.

26:18.120 --> 26:20.124
Lamb should be
out resting.

26:20.124 --> 26:21.292
Christina:
Come on, guys.

26:22.963 --> 26:24.332
Come on, damn it.

26:24.332 --> 26:27.138
Gordon:
<i>Start dressing</i>
<i>your plates.</i>

26:27.138 --> 26:28.574
Perfect slices.

26:28.574 --> 26:30.210
Man:
<i>Jenny, love that crust.</i>

26:30.210 --> 26:32.148
Aarón:
<i>Every last detail, guys.</i>

26:32.148 --> 26:34.318
‐ Gordon: <i>Come on.</i>
‐ Christina: <i>Whoo!</i>

26:34.318 --> 26:35.855
Come on,
get it all on the plate.

26:35.855 --> 26:38.326
‐ <i>Focus on finishing strong.</i>
‐ Man: <i>Come on, guys.</i>

26:38.326 --> 26:39.663
Gordon:
<i>Here we go, ten...</i>

26:39.663 --> 26:41.734
‐ <i>( cheers, applause )</i>
‐ Judges: <i>Nine, eight...</i>

26:41.734 --> 26:44.338
<i>seven, six, five...</i>

26:44.338 --> 26:48.180
<i>four, three, two, one!</i>

26:48.180 --> 26:49.182
‐ Stop!
‐ That's it.

26:49.182 --> 26:50.618
<i>Hands in the air!</i>

26:51.754 --> 26:53.423
‐ ( applause )
‐ Gordon: <i>Well done.</i>

26:55.528 --> 26:59.536
It's time to see who was able
to turn this night around.

26:59.536 --> 27:03.143
<i>and to find out of course</i>
<i>who is heading home for good.</i>

27:03.143 --> 27:04.646
First up, Eboni.
Let's go, please.

27:04.646 --> 27:07.251
I really feel like I let
my husband and my kids down

27:07.251 --> 27:08.554
<i>the way I butchered</i>
<i>this lamb.</i>

27:08.554 --> 27:11.192
<i>So I really hope</i>
<i>that I redeem myself</i>

27:11.192 --> 27:13.396
<i>with the cook on it</i>
<i>especially,</i>

27:13.396 --> 27:15.668
but in this competition,
you never know.

27:15.668 --> 27:18.106
Okay, first off,
across those 60 minutes,

27:18.106 --> 27:20.344
you looked down.
You okay?

27:20.344 --> 27:22.114
I'm okay.
I was concentrating,

27:22.114 --> 27:23.283
trying to put
everything in order

27:23.283 --> 27:25.187
<i>to make sure I don't</i>
<i>forget anything.</i>

27:25.187 --> 27:26.356
<i>Here's the thing, Eboni.</i>

27:26.356 --> 27:28.193
Ten minutes ago,
the way you were cooking,

27:28.193 --> 27:31.534
<i>I thought you had</i>
<i>one foot out the door.</i>

27:31.534 --> 27:35.140
So, I'm amazed you've got
something looking this good.

27:36.476 --> 27:38.079
<i>Visually,</i>
<i>it looks beautiful.</i>

27:38.079 --> 27:40.217
<i>Lamb is not hacked.</i>
<i>It's sliced beautifully.</i>

27:40.217 --> 27:42.556
Love that nice
dark green crust.

27:42.556 --> 27:44.726
It's almost like
the sort of field of grass

27:44.726 --> 27:46.129
that the sheep's
come out on.

27:46.129 --> 27:48.166
It's beautifully done.

27:48.166 --> 27:50.103
Slicing that lamb
is like slicing
through butter.

27:50.103 --> 27:51.574
<i>And look, when you slice</i>
<i>through there,</i>

27:51.574 --> 27:56.750
pink, and then the crust,
nice and crispy.

27:56.750 --> 27:59.021
Uh, the dish is delicious.
Let's get that right.

27:59.021 --> 28:00.424
Thank you, chef.

28:00.424 --> 28:01.794
Gordon:
<i>Lamb is cooked</i>
<i>to perfection.</i>

28:01.794 --> 28:04.098
<i>Carrots beautifully glazed,</i>
<i>sauce not too thick.</i>

28:04.098 --> 28:07.204
What would I change?
Cook the potatoes
a bit longer.

28:07.204 --> 28:10.545
But here's the thing,
you just cook like
a chef's dream.

28:10.545 --> 28:12.883
I need you just
sounding more confident,

28:12.883 --> 28:15.420
<i>just start</i>
<i>believing in yourself</i>
<i>a little bit more.</i>

28:15.420 --> 28:18.126
‐ <i>Great job.</i>
‐ Thank you, chef.

28:18.126 --> 28:20.397
Now, Eboni,
what did you season
this lamb with?

28:20.397 --> 28:22.569
I used some thyme, garlic.

28:22.569 --> 28:25.240
And how much of
that mustard did you
brush down on that lamb?

28:25.240 --> 28:27.746
Two, three tablespoons.

28:27.746 --> 28:30.117
It's delicious.
It's well‐seasoned.

28:30.117 --> 28:32.087
Your vegetables
are beautifully cooked.

28:32.087 --> 28:33.824
You've never made
this dish before,

28:33.824 --> 28:36.864
and yet your replication
of Gordon's dish is
almost exact.

28:36.864 --> 28:39.168
‐ Thank you, chef.
‐ Nice job.

28:39.168 --> 28:41.272
Brien:
<i>Good job, Eboni!</i>

28:43.276 --> 28:45.280
Sam, come forward.

28:45.280 --> 28:47.619
I've been in
the bottom a lot,

28:47.619 --> 28:49.388
<i>but I'm confident</i>
<i>with my dish.</i>

28:49.388 --> 28:51.125
<i>It's no more flunking.</i>

28:51.125 --> 28:52.629
<i>I'm ready to get</i>
<i>that A paper.</i>

28:52.629 --> 28:54.465
<i>That's what I'm here</i>
<i>to show the judges today.</i>

28:54.465 --> 28:56.804
Sam, how do you feel
it went for you there?

28:56.804 --> 28:59.475
I made some mistakes,
but I got everything there,

28:59.475 --> 29:03.249
and frankly, it's one of
the prettier plates I've
presented for you guys.

29:03.249 --> 29:05.487
The lamb. Why did you
choose to sauce

29:05.487 --> 29:07.424
the top part
of the chop?

29:07.424 --> 29:12.167
I was trying to keep
the sauce off the crust,
most importantly.

29:12.167 --> 29:14.338
What is that?

29:14.338 --> 29:16.610
I think that's some
of the sauce that congealed.

29:16.610 --> 29:18.313
I think maybe you
over‐reduced it,

29:18.313 --> 29:19.649
which is a little bit
disappointing.

29:19.649 --> 29:22.121
I think the fact that you
sauced the top of the lamb

29:22.121 --> 29:23.323
<i>also shows</i>
<i>a lot of oversight.</i>

29:23.323 --> 29:25.127
( sighs )
Look at that.

29:25.127 --> 29:27.699
That right there is rare,
black and blue, right?

29:27.699 --> 29:30.505
I mean, this thing
still has fur on it.

29:33.844 --> 29:35.480
I mean‐‐ ( coughs )
here's the deal.

29:35.480 --> 29:38.153
Had this lamb been cooked
a little bit better,

29:38.153 --> 29:40.390
I can overlook some of
the other glaring issues

29:40.390 --> 29:42.094
which is that crust.
Look at that.

29:42.094 --> 29:44.666
Does that look like
your crust, Gordon?
I don't think so.

29:44.666 --> 29:46.737
‐ That's too much
bread crumb, right?
‐ Yeah.

29:46.737 --> 29:48.373
Well, the sauce has
a lot of flavor.

29:48.373 --> 29:50.444
‐ Thank you.
‐ That's the only thing

29:50.444 --> 29:52.715
<i>I can gravitate towards</i>
<i>that gives me some relief</i>

29:52.715 --> 29:54.185
from the undercooking
of the lamb.

29:54.185 --> 29:56.289
There's some
fundamental mistakes

29:56.289 --> 29:57.892
that are very hard
to overlook.

29:59.028 --> 30:01.800
Sam, I don't mind
the rare,

30:01.800 --> 30:03.771
medium‐rare pink,
beautiful.

30:03.771 --> 30:06.275
But blue
there's no excuse for.

30:06.275 --> 30:07.645
( sighs )

30:07.645 --> 30:10.217
The lamb, it's so rare

30:10.217 --> 30:12.889
that even the fat
hasn't even rendered down.

30:12.889 --> 30:15.460
<i>Also, the actual</i>
<i>crumb mixture</i>

30:15.460 --> 30:17.732
is so bland
and anemic‐looking,

30:17.732 --> 30:19.335
it looks unappetizing.

30:19.335 --> 30:22.141
So, blue lamb...

30:22.141 --> 30:25.413
is an insult to the cut.

30:25.413 --> 30:26.617
I wouldn't even
( bleep ) swallow that.

30:26.617 --> 30:28.253
I can't do that
to my palate.

30:28.253 --> 30:29.488
( coughs )

30:29.488 --> 30:32.427
Let me ask you this:
are you happy with it?

30:32.427 --> 30:34.666
‐ I might eat it.
‐ You'd seriously
eat blue lamb?

30:34.666 --> 30:35.935
Yeah, I would.

30:35.935 --> 30:37.805
For you to turn round
and openly admit

30:37.805 --> 30:39.208
that you'd eat
that ( bleep ),

30:39.208 --> 30:41.880
that tells me
a lot about you, Sam.

30:41.880 --> 30:45.621
I'm disappointed.
I really wanted to
impress the judges,

30:45.621 --> 30:46.890
and I failed with that today.

30:46.890 --> 30:48.894
<i>But I know</i>
<i>that my flavors are there,</i>

30:48.894 --> 30:52.234
<i>and I hope it's enough</i>
<i>to keep me safe.</i>

30:52.234 --> 30:54.205
Next up, Jennifer, please.
Let's go.

30:54.205 --> 30:55.541
I lost my cool
during the cook,

30:55.541 --> 30:57.545
but I feel like it doesn't
reflect on my plate.

30:57.545 --> 30:59.181
<i>I feel like</i>
<i>I pulled it together,</i>

30:59.181 --> 31:01.319
and I'm hoping this dish
will keep me here.

31:01.319 --> 31:04.358
First of all, have you ever
been in an airplane

31:04.358 --> 31:06.128
where it hits turbulence,

31:06.128 --> 31:07.665
and the thing
starts nose‐diving?

31:07.665 --> 31:09.268
‐ No.
‐ I have‐‐

31:09.268 --> 31:13.611
watching you cook
across the last
60 minutes.

31:13.611 --> 31:16.449
Are you confused
as much as I am right now?

31:16.449 --> 31:18.721
What in
the ( bleep ) happened?

31:27.137 --> 31:28.306
Gordon:
First of all,

31:28.306 --> 31:30.076
have you ever been
in an airplane

31:30.076 --> 31:33.483
where it hits turbulence
and the thing starts
nose‐diving?

31:33.483 --> 31:34.986
‐ No.
‐ <i>I have‐‐</i>

31:34.986 --> 31:38.226
watching you cook
across the last 60 minutes.

31:40.163 --> 31:42.267
What in
the ( bleep ) happened?

31:42.267 --> 31:44.171
I'm kind of at
a loss for words.

31:44.171 --> 31:46.342
The only thing I can
think of is that

31:46.342 --> 31:49.348
‐ I get panicky, 'cause‐‐
‐ Why?

31:49.348 --> 31:52.254
You take people's
possessions away
for a living!

31:52.254 --> 31:55.695
And you get yourself
in a tizz cooking
a piece of lamb?

31:55.695 --> 31:57.899
‐ Are you ready to quit?
‐ No, I don't want to quit.

31:57.899 --> 31:59.936
I'm not here to quit.
I want to be here.

31:59.936 --> 32:01.238
‐ You do?
‐ Yes, chef.

32:01.238 --> 32:02.675
‐ Then stay composed.
‐ Okay.

32:02.675 --> 32:06.215
So, lamb is cooked pink.
Well done.

32:06.215 --> 32:07.719
Let's taste it.

32:11.727 --> 32:13.262
Here's the thing.

32:13.262 --> 32:15.200
Lamb's cooked beautifully,
let's get that right.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.104
Sauce, carrots,
cooked beautifully.

32:17.104 --> 32:20.678
However, you put the rack
back in the oven upside down.

32:20.678 --> 32:22.749
That's why it's
slightly soggy underneath.

32:22.749 --> 32:25.688
Not a big deal.
You did a really good job.

32:25.688 --> 32:27.558
Stop working yourself up.

32:27.558 --> 32:30.130
Stay composed, confident,

32:30.130 --> 32:31.600
and don't show
that weakness.

32:31.600 --> 32:33.302
‐ Promise?
‐ I promise.

32:33.302 --> 32:34.706
‐ <i>Good girl.</i>
‐ Okay, thank you.

32:34.706 --> 32:35.875
Cate:
Good job, Jennifer.

32:35.875 --> 32:39.381
( cheers, applause )

32:42.889 --> 32:44.793
Aarón:
Miss Caitlin.
Please come down.

32:44.793 --> 32:46.495
( applause )

32:46.495 --> 32:49.234
Caitlin:
<i>I have been barely sliding</i>
<i>by in this competition.</i>

32:49.234 --> 32:52.307
'Cause I have been in the bottom
three times in a row,

32:52.307 --> 32:56.315
<i>so I really need to show</i>
<i>the judges why I deserve</i>
<i>to stay in this competition.</i>

32:56.315 --> 32:58.252
Aarón:
<i>Caitlin, so you've cooked</i>
<i>with lamb before?</i>

32:58.252 --> 32:59.589
Very rarely.

32:59.589 --> 33:03.129
Once or twice on Easter
with my family.

33:03.129 --> 33:04.866
Well, you know what?
I couldn't tell.

33:04.866 --> 33:07.137
‐ It looks like Easter around
here, because...
‐ Thank you.

33:07.137 --> 33:10.711
this is something you could
find at many restaurants
all over the world.

33:10.711 --> 33:13.082
Do you eat at a lot
of high‐end restaurants, or no?

33:13.082 --> 33:16.222
I prefer to get humble groceries
and cook them up at home

33:16.222 --> 33:19.394
in a way that I can
stretch my budget and focus
on my dance training.

33:25.306 --> 33:29.248
The cooking of the lamb,
which is a true star here,

33:29.248 --> 33:31.786
is out of this world.

33:31.786 --> 33:33.422
I mean look at that.
You guys see that up there?

33:33.422 --> 33:34.659
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yes, chef.

33:34.659 --> 33:36.195
‐ <i>That's medium rare.</i>
‐ Gorgeous.

33:36.195 --> 33:38.132
For me, the balance
is definitely there.

33:38.132 --> 33:40.270
It's vibrant, it's fresh.
I love the fact

33:40.270 --> 33:42.207
that you didn't go heavy
on the mustard.

33:42.207 --> 33:45.948
<i>I can see the color of the</i>
<i>potatoes have that beautiful</i>
<i>bronze exterior,</i>

33:45.948 --> 33:48.486
<i>and you've wilted down</i>
<i>the carrots in such a way</i>

33:48.486 --> 33:51.292
that they truly are caramelized
and glazed. I love that.

33:51.292 --> 33:53.897
‐ Well done.
‐ Thank you, chef.

33:53.897 --> 33:57.505
Look at that lamb.
Unbelievable.

33:57.505 --> 33:59.809
All right, what were you
worried about going into it?

33:59.809 --> 34:02.147
I was primarily worried
about the cook on the lamb,

34:02.147 --> 34:05.186
so I pulled it out
of the oven at 120 degrees

34:05.186 --> 34:07.758
<i>and let it rest</i>
<i>for at least ten minutes.</i>

34:10.430 --> 34:12.602
Well, you've nailed it.
Ten times over.

34:12.602 --> 34:15.106
Look, pink.
Beautiful throughout.

34:15.106 --> 34:17.277
Plating, great finesse.

34:17.277 --> 34:18.714
What's the worse thing
about the dish?

34:18.714 --> 34:19.983
You've got the breading
a little bit too clumsy.

34:19.983 --> 34:22.688
‐ Okay.
‐ That's it.

34:22.688 --> 34:23.724
<i>Lamb's delicious.</i>

34:23.724 --> 34:25.126
Fondant, cooked beautifully.

34:25.126 --> 34:26.462
Carrots braised beautifully.

34:26.462 --> 34:28.132
<i>I mean, it's</i>
<i>a restaurant‐quality dish.</i>

34:28.132 --> 34:30.504
Continue like this,
you're going to be
more than a threat.

34:30.504 --> 34:33.476
‐ Very well done.
‐ Thank you so much.

34:33.476 --> 34:35.480
‐ Good job, Caitlin.
‐ Nice job, Caitlin.

34:36.516 --> 34:38.386
Finally.

34:40.891 --> 34:42.561
Next up, please, Jenny.

34:42.561 --> 34:45.166
Necco:
<i>Come on, Jenny.</i>

34:45.166 --> 34:49.241
Going up in front of the judges
is always a nerve‐wracking
experience.

34:49.241 --> 34:51.846
Especially when you're
replicating the dishes

34:51.846 --> 34:53.583
<i>of some of the best</i>
<i>chefs in the world.</i>

34:53.583 --> 34:55.721
<i>They know those dishes</i>
<i>inside and out,</i>

34:55.721 --> 34:59.127
<i>and so I'm scared</i>
<i>that I might not have gotten</i>
<i>the flavors completely right.</i>

34:59.127 --> 35:01.566
‐ All right, Miss Jenny.
‐ Yes, chef?

35:01.566 --> 35:05.808
What was sort of your
biggest challenge over
this one hour cook?

35:05.808 --> 35:08.379
Definitely getting
the lamb rack cleaned.

35:08.379 --> 35:11.485
I didn't get it to the point
where I needed it to be,

35:11.485 --> 35:14.157
but I did my best to get
off as much as I could.

35:14.157 --> 35:15.861
I'm hoping I did
just enough.

35:15.861 --> 35:17.865
Potato fondant is nice,
cooked well.

35:17.865 --> 35:19.736
<i>Carrots very well seasoned.</i>

35:19.736 --> 35:21.539
The cook on the lamb
is beautiful.

35:21.539 --> 35:26.281
The sauce for me is really
the star that helps make
the lamb shine.

35:26.281 --> 35:28.219
You know, visually, I would
have loved to see you spend

35:28.219 --> 35:31.425
a little bit more time
on these bones here,
really polishing them off.

35:31.425 --> 35:34.231
The flavors are there.
You did a pretty good job.

35:34.231 --> 35:35.567
Thank you, chef.

35:42.113 --> 35:44.384
The cooking of that lamb
is spectacular.

35:44.384 --> 35:46.221
You did a beautiful sear
on the outside.

35:46.221 --> 35:49.261
<i>I think your crust</i>
<i>is one of the better crusts</i>
<i>that I've tasted so far.</i>

35:49.261 --> 35:52.300
<i>I saw your lamb before</i>
<i>it became this.</i>

35:52.300 --> 35:53.737
You made something
really special.

35:53.737 --> 35:56.441
I mean, you completely
transformed what at one point

35:56.441 --> 35:57.778
<i>didn't look like it</i>
<i>was salvageable.</i>

35:57.778 --> 36:00.249
‐ That's amazing.
‐ Thank you, chef.

36:00.249 --> 36:02.521
‐ Good job.
‐ Jason: <i>Great job, Jenny.</i>

36:02.521 --> 36:03.690
Daniel:
Killin' it.

36:07.363 --> 36:10.704
Christina:
<i>Newton, please bring</i>
<i>your plate forward.</i>

36:10.704 --> 36:13.142
In the previous challenge,
I've let the judges down.

36:13.142 --> 36:14.979
<i>But now,</i>
<i>I feel quite confident.</i>

36:14.979 --> 36:16.883
<i>My meat looks good,</i>

36:16.883 --> 36:18.954
my accoutrements look good,
my sauce is excellent.

36:18.954 --> 36:21.225
<i>This is the time</i>
<i>to redeem myself.</i>

36:22.561 --> 36:24.464
All right, Newton,
ranch owner from Texas.

36:24.464 --> 36:26.335
<i>You definitely know meat.</i>

36:26.335 --> 36:28.573
How would you feel,
if you left tonight

36:28.573 --> 36:31.411
on a butchering and meat
cooking challenge?

36:31.411 --> 36:33.683
I don't know if I
can say "jackass,"

36:33.683 --> 36:37.591
but my friends would give me
a hard time about it.

36:37.591 --> 36:40.162
All right, let's dig in.

36:40.162 --> 36:43.435
Now lamb, Gordon's
cooked medium rare.

36:43.435 --> 36:46.174
Let's see how you did.

36:50.349 --> 36:52.988
Uh, okay.

36:52.988 --> 36:54.992
<i>Newton...</i>

36:54.992 --> 36:58.833
um...
your lamb is...

37:10.089 --> 37:11.425
( sighs )

37:11.425 --> 37:14.297
Newton, wish I had
better news.

37:14.297 --> 37:16.536
Your lamb is definitely
undercooked.

37:22.681 --> 37:25.386
How much mustard
did you put on there?

37:25.386 --> 37:26.689
<i>That's a lot of heat.</i>

37:26.689 --> 37:28.560
Did you kind of use
that as the glue?

37:28.560 --> 37:30.731
I did.

37:30.731 --> 37:34.638
<i>The carrots, the potatoes,</i>
<i>they're cooked beautifully,</i>

37:34.638 --> 37:38.078
but the crusting balance
of herbs is off,

37:38.078 --> 37:43.389
and for me, beyond
the lamb being undercooked,
there's so much mustard.

37:43.389 --> 37:45.192
<i>That it tastes</i>
<i>like Dijon mustard</i>

37:45.192 --> 37:50.169
before it tastes like
beautiful gamey lamb.

37:50.169 --> 37:53.175
If I thought anyone was going
to nail this challenge,
I thought it was you.

37:53.175 --> 37:56.381
Maybe the only person
that would love
that dish is Sam.

37:59.855 --> 38:03.228
I'm so disappointed
and disgusted with myself.

38:03.228 --> 38:06.401
<i>I'm supposed to be the guy</i>
<i>that skates through this</i>
<i>with a blindfold.</i>

38:06.401 --> 38:08.072
I actually feel
like I'm going home.

38:08.072 --> 38:09.875
I've screwed the pooch.

38:14.417 --> 38:17.758
Guys, this was an extremely
difficult challenge,

38:17.758 --> 38:22.433
but two of you excelled
beyond our expectations.

38:22.433 --> 38:27.343
<i>The two people</i>
<i>that are absolutely</i>
<i>safe tonight are Eboni...</i>

38:27.343 --> 38:30.584
‐ Thank you, chef.
‐ and Caitlin.

38:30.584 --> 38:32.186
‐ Daniel: <i>Well deserved.</i>
‐ Thank you.

38:32.186 --> 38:33.288
Head up to the balcony.

38:33.288 --> 38:35.760
Bum, bum, bum, bah.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.865
<i>I just heard the church</i>
<i>bells ringing. I'm safe.</i>

38:37.865 --> 38:39.635
Great job. Well done.

38:39.635 --> 38:43.242
I cracked for just
a little bit, got nervous.

38:43.242 --> 38:45.714
<i>Not no more.</i>
<i>Everybody gotta be worried now.</i>

38:49.154 --> 38:51.124
All right, so there's
four of you.

38:51.124 --> 38:54.397
<i>The fact of the matter is</i>
<i>that two of you are safe.</i>

38:54.397 --> 38:58.272
Jenny, please step forward.

38:58.272 --> 39:04.184
<i>Jennifer, please step forward.</i>

39:04.184 --> 39:09.127
Tonight, you guys
did just enough

39:09.127 --> 39:10.764
to stay in this competition

39:10.764 --> 39:14.103
Please, head upstairs.

39:14.103 --> 39:15.574
Jennifer:
<i>I'm going up to the balcony,</i>
<i>now I'm safe,</i>

39:15.574 --> 39:16.776
<i>and that is a huge relief.</i>

39:16.776 --> 39:19.113
There's no more getting
into a huffy puffy.

39:19.113 --> 39:21.084
No more tailspins.
It's time to work.

39:21.084 --> 39:27.096
<i>It's time to figure out</i>
<i>how I'm gonna get</i>
<i>myself to the top.</i>

39:27.096 --> 39:32.507
Two of you stand here,
one of you will be leaving
this competition tonight.

39:32.507 --> 39:35.747
Sam, you are clearly passionate,
let's get that right.

39:35.747 --> 39:38.118
<i>You're a smart,</i>
<i>intelligent young man,</i>

39:38.118 --> 39:40.790
<i>but that test got</i>
<i>the better of you.</i>

39:40.790 --> 39:45.266
Newton, you are talented.
You do have a future in food.

39:45.266 --> 39:50.376
But your dish
was just a disgrace.

39:50.376 --> 39:55.687
<i>My money was on you.</i>
<i>Tonight, you let yourself</i>
<i>down, you let me down.</i>

39:55.687 --> 39:59.628
Gentlemen, one of you knows,

39:59.628 --> 40:03.468
it's the end of the road.

40:03.468 --> 40:09.180
If that's you, please,
go ahead and untie your
apron, gracefully.

40:23.408 --> 40:27.216
<i>Christina, Aarón,</i>
<i>and myself agree.</i>

40:27.216 --> 40:30.422
Newton, say goodbye to Sam,
head on upstairs.

40:30.422 --> 40:33.261
Good luck, buddy.
Good luck to you always.

40:41.879 --> 40:45.754
<i>Sam, were really</i>
<i>hoping you would have</i>
<i>bounced back tonight,</i>

40:45.754 --> 40:49.494
but you are not ready
to become America's
next master chef.

40:49.494 --> 40:52.066
Sam:
<i>You know, cooking,</i>
<i>it's something I love.</i>

40:52.066 --> 40:55.472
I'm happy because
I think the criticism

40:55.472 --> 40:57.911
<i>that I got from you guys</i>
<i>made me stronger,</i>

40:57.911 --> 41:00.683
and I feel privileged.

41:00.683 --> 41:04.792
Sam, please place
your apron on your bench
and go back to school.

41:04.792 --> 41:07.229
‐ Thank you.
‐ Bye, Sam. We love you.

41:07.229 --> 41:09.233
Caitlin:
Love you, Sam.

41:09.233 --> 41:10.770
Sam took a bullet
for me, today.

41:12.541 --> 41:16.782
Feel bad for him,
happy as hell for me.

41:16.782 --> 41:19.220
<i>I think this was a good</i>
<i>kick in my pants</i>

41:19.220 --> 41:21.291
<i>to get me laser‐focused.</i>

41:21.291 --> 41:26.234
I gotta take every one
of these challenges on
as if it's my last.

41:26.234 --> 41:28.171
Sam, best wishes.

41:30.242 --> 41:31.579
<i>Bye, Sam.</i>

41:31.579 --> 41:33.916
<i>Bye, Sam.</i>

41:36.589 --> 41:37.691
Announcer:
<i>Next time on "MasterChef"...</i>

41:37.691 --> 41:39.193
Service!

41:39.193 --> 41:42.032
<i>...the home cooks run</i>
<i>a five‐star restaurant service.</i>

41:42.032 --> 41:43.301
Too many, one pancake.

41:43.301 --> 41:45.773
<i>But will this high‐end</i>
<i>breakfast challenge...</i>

41:45.773 --> 41:46.775
Burning your eggs.

41:46.775 --> 41:48.813
<i>...leave one team scrambled?</i>

41:48.813 --> 41:50.282
Where's my two and two?!

41:50.282 --> 41:51.619
It's not up, it's done.

41:51.619 --> 41:53.623
If my pancakes are up,
then they're dying.

41:53.623 --> 41:55.292
You need to get this together.

41:55.292 --> 41:57.797
Five‐star hotel,
and we're serving that.

41:57.797 --> 41:59.200
Oh, my God.

42:00.302 --> 42:01.404
<i>Followed by a pressure test...</i>

42:01.404 --> 42:02.774
Fish and chips.

42:02.774 --> 42:04.778
<i>...that's a Gordon Ramsay</i>
<i>classic.</i>
