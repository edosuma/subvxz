WEBVTT

00:28.445 --> 00:33.158
That fucking janitor keeps smiling at
me, with his creepy nasty face.

00:34.785 --> 00:37.538
He smacked my ass while
I was washing my hands.

00:38.163 --> 00:41.041
No one believes me,
except Sonia and Miss Craig.

00:42.501 --> 00:46.797
Everyone else says he's a good person,
and I'm just a delusional little bitch.

00:48.048 --> 00:49.633
What the hell am I still doing here?

02:26.396 --> 02:30.025
All doors and windows
locked, goodnight Angela.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.047
I skipped school again today.

02:53.590 --> 02:56.885
That bitch is always making fun
of me in front of the zombies.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.639
I don't know why she hates me so much.

03:01.264 --> 03:04.309
I never did anything to
her or her dumb boyfriend.

04:29.478 --> 04:32.814
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

04:35.734 --> 04:39.237
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

04:41.698 --> 04:45.285
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

04:48.205 --> 04:49.623
Warning, the window

05:36.044 --> 05:41.508
Following the Italian government's recent terrorist
attack, the curfew has been extended by 3 hours.

05:42.509 --> 05:47.347
The curfew will now start at
6pm and will conclude at 6am.

05:49.057 --> 05:54.437
I know it's been a long time, but I need
your help. Meet me at the market, 10am

05:54.729 --> 05:59.209
Any individual found guilty of conspiring with or aiding
Italian terrorists will be tried and executed on the spot

06:13.665 --> 06:18.753
Hello... my name is Alexander Morin,

06:19.296 --> 06:26.678
I am... was, a journalist, back when
real journalism was still permitted.

06:26.970 --> 06:31.349
But there was one story that
I never got to the bottom of;

06:31.892 --> 06:36.104
a truth that remained untold.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.064
The Annie Red case;

06:38.690 --> 06:42.986
I believe it to be no
accident, but I need evidence.

06:44.905 --> 06:47.741
This brings me to why I contacted you...

06:49.367 --> 06:55.248
Having been a close friend
ofAnnie's mother, Angela,

06:55.540 --> 06:58.919
I believe you are in a
unique position to help.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.838
You see, I have reason to believe Angela

07:02.130 --> 07:05.008
has been withholding vital
information about the case.

07:06.134 --> 07:11.222
Already, I myself have often
tried to contact Angela,

07:11.932 --> 07:17.437
to no avail...
perhaps you can succeed where I failed

07:18.563 --> 07:22.067
I just want to get justice
for that little girl,

07:22.359 --> 07:24.611
is that really so much to ask?

07:26.154 --> 07:30.992
Already a sum, double your standard
fee, has been lodged in your account.

07:32.702 --> 07:39.417
I trust you won't speak of
this investigation to anyone.

07:39.709 --> 07:42.420
And please don't try to contact me,

07:43.213 --> 07:46.174
just send me a message
and I'll get back to you.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.801
Thank you.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.308
Hi, Angela

07:57.435 --> 07:59.521
This is a public service announcement.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.440
It is vital that all
citizens remain vigilant.

08:03.358 --> 08:05.026
If you see anything suspicious,

08:05.318 --> 08:09.406
or if you have any information relating
to the recent terrorist incidents,

08:09.698 --> 08:17.372
contact @UKMartial immediately via
Lettera or call the emergency number 508.

08:17.872 --> 08:22.502
Until further notice, the mandatory
curfew has been extended by 3 hours.

08:23.753 --> 08:28.591
Curfew will be strictly enforced
between the hours of6pm and 6am.

08:29.259 --> 08:34.179
I repeat, the mandatory curfew
has been extended by 3 hours.

08:34.681 --> 08:39.144
Curfew will be strictly enforced
between the hours of6pm and 6am.

08:40.227 --> 08:42.480
Remain in your homes during these times.

09:15.972 --> 09:18.433
I've got to admit,
those other Crows did a great job on you.

09:19.225 --> 09:22.353
I mean, sewing together two human
beings is not an easy task, is it?

09:25.273 --> 09:28.234
Especially when they are as
mangled up as you are hahahah

09:44.167 --> 09:46.836
Mistrandia said I'm the
fourth replacement...

09:50.757 --> 09:52.175
what happened to the others?

10:01.017 --> 10:04.979
Here you go. Try your best to keep
the lens clean next time huntsman...

10:05.730 --> 10:08.108
Or should I say Huntsmen, eh? ahahaha

10:15.073 --> 10:19.160
Access granted, faced recognized.
Welcome home

10:25.750 --> 10:29.087
Are you tired but you are unable to sleep?

10:29.587 --> 10:34.342
You want to just relax,
but the insomnia is too strong.

10:34.926 --> 10:35.593
Look at me,

10:35.927 --> 10:38.847
your eyelids are so heavy,

10:39.389 --> 10:42.058
your neck is so soft,

10:42.350 --> 10:45.353
you feel so good.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.398
Goodnight

11:16.092 --> 11:18.011
Ok, let's go see your mother.

11:34.319 --> 11:35.570
So, how are you doing?

11:36.696 --> 11:38.615
Fine... I'm actually moving house.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.201
You willing to move far from here?

11:42.368 --> 11:47.290
Yeah, I thought I'd go back into town. Well, I
think it's time I did a lot of things I put off.

11:47.582 --> 11:50.752
I thought your dream was to have an
house surrounded by trees and greenery

11:51.502 --> 11:55.131
Yes it was, things change I guess

11:55.590 --> 11:57.342
So how is your love life?

11:59.552 --> 12:02.972
Michael, you mean? It's over

12:04.015 --> 12:05.600
I'm sorry about that.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.562
No it's fine, it's for the better;

12:10.271 --> 12:12.190
So what are doing for work?

12:13.691 --> 12:18.821
Well, it's quite a big change,
it's a bit crazy actually

12:19.113 --> 12:20.113
Really?

12:20.698 --> 12:24.577
Yeah, could be working
for a detective agency

12:25.578 --> 12:28.289
Oh, is it interesting?

12:29.332 --> 12:37.048
Yeah, it's something I always wanted to do.
I just took a weapon's licensing class.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.466
Wow...

12:41.844 --> 12:45.682
That's the door on the first floor, it
always slams when you don't close it well

13:10.290 --> 13:13.001
I... I ain't ever seen a Wolf
Infection like this before.

13:17.672 --> 13:21.884
I mean, you need to clean
the gangrene... and...

13:22.176 --> 13:24.971
Sorry... (Cough)

13:27.140 --> 13:29.684
and you need to remove the
pus from these wounds...

13:30.935 --> 13:32.979
You see? Like t.. this..

13:37.358 --> 13:38.735
Like that

13:39.986 --> 13:41.195
So sorry...

13:51.372 --> 13:53.291
I really didn't mean to offend you madam...

13:54.459 --> 13:56.919
please accept my sincerest
apologies grandmother...

14:01.841 --> 14:03.760
Please forgive me (Cough cough)

14:06.512 --> 14:09.140
Oh shit...

14:48.930 --> 14:50.848
Can I ask you a favour?

14:51.808 --> 14:52.808
Sure

14:52.934 --> 14:58.731
I mean, It's very hard for me at the
moment again. Something is happening

14:59.649 --> 15:00.649
Is it serious?

15:01.192 --> 15:02.192
I think so,

15:03.319 --> 15:06.572
I'm not sure if it's a man or a woman...

15:07.740 --> 15:09.075
someone is stalking me.

15:09.367 --> 15:10.076
What?

15:10.368 --> 15:11.702
Did you call the police?

15:11.994 --> 15:12.994
No, not yet

15:13.413 --> 15:15.331
Well I think you should

15:15.623 --> 15:20.837
To be honest, I went to the police station, but the
policemen didn't seem to take it too seriously

15:21.129 --> 15:21.629
Why?

15:22.046 --> 15:26.008
They said they need some concrete
evidence, and they think I don't have any

15:30.054 --> 15:33.599
You know the one who is stalking me is
very careful not to leave any traces,

15:34.100 --> 15:36.936
no phone calls, no messages

15:39.564 --> 15:44.152
It started some time ago, at first he makes
me find animal corpses in the front garden

15:46.904 --> 15:52.910
Mice... cats ...even a little lamb

15:54.287 --> 15:55.287
What did the police say?

15:55.955 --> 15:58.916
They said those animals could
have naturally died in the garden.

16:00.543 --> 16:03.129
I guess they think I put
them there on my own.

16:05.214 --> 16:08.551
All the corpses were
lying in the same place.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.845
Their legs facing the entrance of the house

16:13.055 --> 16:14.765
Yesterday it got into the house...

16:16.225 --> 16:18.144
took one of my daughter's dolls.

16:20.980 --> 16:24.150
Do you remember my daughter, Annie?

16:25.067 --> 16:26.944
Yes of course...

16:28.988 --> 16:30.323
Do you think I'm crazy?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.157
No

16:34.118 --> 16:35.118
I do...

16:35.661 --> 16:38.080
I think I'm driving myself crazy...

16:41.209 --> 16:45.213
I'd like you to help me
understand what is happening...

16:46.297 --> 16:47.298
Ok

16:49.133 --> 16:51.886
Look, I'm already moving,
so how about I come here for the night?

16:54.430 --> 16:59.018
You know, just stay for one night, it
might help you feel a bit more protected.

17:01.145 --> 17:02.730
Okay, thank you

17:46.232 --> 17:47.858
The wolf...

17:51.612 --> 17:57.493
the wolf's existence reminds us
how lucky we are to still be human.

17:57.785 --> 18:02.540
But with each breath, the wolf also
reminds us that we have failed.

18:02.999 --> 18:05.835
We sacrifice our left hand,

18:06.127 --> 18:09.505
he sister who helped us
to heal the infection.

18:09.797 --> 18:17.797
This sacrifice will fuel us with
both pain and with ephemeral joy,

18:19.181 --> 18:22.393
preparing us for our
battle against the unclean.

18:25.605 --> 18:30.359
Rejoice and suffer, son of my son.

19:56.696 --> 20:00.157
All doors and windows
locked, goodnight Angela.

20:15.047 --> 20:17.133
That douchebag is even worse than her.

20:18.259 --> 20:20.886
Yesterday morning he pissed on my diary.

20:22.179 --> 20:23.347
I wish they would just die.

21:21.447 --> 21:24.366
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

21:29.622 --> 21:32.583
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

21:54.104 --> 21:58.442
When I woke up this morning I was
lying on the floor, next to the window

22:01.278 --> 22:05.699
I woke up on the floor again today.
This is the third time.

22:11.413 --> 22:12.790
Mom doesn't give a fuck.

22:13.082 --> 22:15.000
All she does is cry and overreact.

22:15.626 --> 22:18.212
I don't even know why I
call her 'Mom' anymore.

22:20.297 --> 22:22.758
I'm starting to hate seeing
my face in the mirror.

22:23.133 --> 22:26.846
Sometimes it looks like mom's fucking
face, and I can't stand it.

22:28.097 --> 22:30.391
This house is a stinking pile of shit now.

22:32.184 --> 22:33.769
I was happy when Dad was here...

22:41.068 --> 22:42.278
WE were happy.

22:50.828 --> 22:53.247
Sorry if I skip the pleasantries

22:53.747 --> 22:58.335
but something has been on my mind
since our conversation yesterday;

22:59.253 --> 23:02.590
just what was it that happened
between you and Angela?

23:03.924 --> 23:07.678
I had an affair with a married man...

23:08.220 --> 23:09.722
He's name is Michael

23:10.014 --> 23:11.515
She judged me

23:12.224 --> 23:16.061
She thought I was immoral and cruel.

23:17.187 --> 23:19.106
So Angela left you?

23:20.441 --> 23:23.861
One of Michael's requests was
to exclude Angela from my life.

23:24.528 --> 23:28.157
So you left her, I see.

23:30.117 --> 23:32.578
And why did you accept this job Diane?

23:33.787 --> 23:37.041
I just... I really wanna make things right

23:38.042 --> 23:41.629
She was going through the hardest
thing she has ever been through,

23:43.005 --> 23:44.548
and I wasn't there for her.

23:45.591 --> 23:48.510
Well now is your chance.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.013
Thank you.

24:15.704 --> 24:18.832
The only decent people in this
school are Sonia and Miss Craig.

24:19.667 --> 24:21.335
They are the only ones who talk to me.

24:22.711 --> 24:24.880
Sometimes they even make
me feel like I'm normal.

26:10.652 --> 26:15.949
Access granted, faced recognized.
Welcome home, guest Diane.

26:49.942 --> 26:53.737
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

26:57.741 --> 27:01.286
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

27:08.252 --> 27:12.214
Warning, the window upstairs is unlocked

27:15.592 --> 27:17.511
Warning, the window upsta..

27:59.595 --> 28:02.556
Rejoice in your sacrifice,

28:03.390 --> 28:06.101
you half-innocent lamb:

28:06.518 --> 28:13.859
you who aided the unclean,
you who brought joy to their rotten hearts.

28:14.776 --> 28:21.742
Because your pain will temporarily
slake the Wolf's anger,

28:22.576 --> 28:28.373
because your pain will
give our brothers power,

28:29.041 --> 28:33.128
because your pain will impair the Wolf.

28:33.587 --> 28:39.927
Rejoice in your sacrifice,
because your pain is pure and holy.

29:07.454 --> 29:12.376
And they covered the bread
with the Martyrs' Oil,

29:15.796 --> 29:22.177
to remind themselves that one
cannot feed on happiness alone,

29:25.097 --> 29:33.063
just as the beast errs
by feasting only on pain.

29:35.524 --> 29:40.028
Rejoice and suffer, son of my son.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.313
Good morning

30:17.524 --> 30:18.984
Hi, did you sleep well?

30:23.030 --> 30:27.326
Yes I think so, I needed to go
upstairs to close the window

30:27.784 --> 30:29.704
When the wind is strong
the door beats all night

30:42.382 --> 30:44.142
You're hungry,
do you want something to eat?

30:44.718 --> 30:45.718
Yes, I'm starving

31:02.235 --> 31:03.235
Can I ask you something?

31:03.987 --> 31:04.987
Sure

31:08.825 --> 31:10.744
Why did you end your
relationship with Michael?

31:11.995 --> 31:16.666
I discovered he had another
relationship, a third one

31:16.958 --> 31:18.877
so I decided to leave him

31:19.753 --> 31:23.715
When I found out... I was forced to
consider that what we had was not real.

31:25.300 --> 31:26.426
It wasn't real love,

31:28.011 --> 31:29.691
he was never gonna break up with his wife,

31:32.599 --> 31:37.354
It was just an excuse so
he can have another lover

31:39.773 --> 31:42.943
You won't believe me
Diane, but I'm really sorry

31:43.485 --> 31:46.738
No it's like you said,
Michael was never mine.

31:49.157 --> 31:51.076
...It was just an illusion

31:53.078 --> 31:58.208
But now I'm here,
and I really wanna help you, ok?

31:58.792 --> 32:00.293
Let's just focus on this

32:00.585 --> 32:03.338
I don't want that you feel
like you owe me, Diane...

32:04.589 --> 32:05.799
I was just giving you a hint,

32:06.716 --> 32:08.427
it's what friends use to do, isn't it?

32:08.718 --> 32:12.931
I don't feel like I owe you about
your advice, about Michael...

32:13.390 --> 32:14.766
Annie you mean?

32:16.309 --> 32:21.064
I should have been here for
you, but shame kept me away

32:23.608 --> 32:25.152
I'm gonna go shopping now

32:27.070 --> 32:28.196
the fridge is empty.

32:29.990 --> 32:31.908
Give me a couple of
minutes, I'll come with you

32:32.617 --> 32:36.371
No, do you mind if you stay here?
I don't want to leave the house empty.

32:37.539 --> 32:38.957
Ok, Sure

32:40.834 --> 32:42.544
You can put your stuff in Annie's room

32:42.836 --> 32:43.836
Fine

32:44.713 --> 32:48.216
I mean you can put your clothes in
there, you can sleep in mine

32:49.968 --> 32:51.303
Ok thanks

34:02.749 --> 34:06.586
I got a phone call this evening
from an old Italian woman.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.464
She's the leader of some religious group.

34:09.797 --> 34:15.428
She said I'm sick, and that's why I keep waking up
in weird places and can't remember what happened.

34:15.719 --> 34:19.391
Dad had the same illness,
but he was even sicker than me.

34:19.975 --> 34:26.231
She said he was dangerous, and that's why he
left us: he didn't want to harm me or Mom.

34:27.023 --> 34:32.237
She said that this is an ancient illness and
their group have been curing it for generations.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.739
She said they can help me,
just like they helped my Dad.

34:36.241 --> 34:39.703
I've got so many questions
to ask them about Dad.

34:40.453 --> 34:42.371
I did some research on them.

34:42.914 --> 34:47.418
Apparently, they don't have a "lettera" account
because I couldn't find much on the web about them.

34:48.085 --> 34:51.672
They call themselves the Woodmen,
and they are a religious cult.

34:52.215 --> 34:55.385
They used to find helpers on the web
and they'd recruit homeless people.

34:55.760 --> 35:00.765
They stopped doing that after they got the
support of Lumen Corp - yes, the famous one.

35:01.099 --> 35:03.018
After that, they just disappeared.

35:03.643 --> 35:08.982
Apparently, they own a few places here in London, like a
couple of abandoned warehouses and a desecrated church.

35:12.986 --> 35:16.072
You bleeding bastards...

35:17.449 --> 35:18.700
You killed her...

35:20.869 --> 35:23.955
you killed her, I know you're here.

35:27.167 --> 35:28.376
I know you're here.

35:29.252 --> 35:30.462
Come out!!!

35:32.088 --> 35:33.673
I know you're here.

35:38.470 --> 35:40.639
I know you killed her

36:34.734 --> 36:35.735
I brought some food,

36:39.906 --> 36:42.659
you must be starving.

36:43.618 --> 36:45.328
I'm gonna put them in my jacket,

36:46.496 --> 36:47.496
right?

36:47.747 --> 36:50.417
And then, you take them out, right?

36:51.960 --> 36:53.878
You have to brush your teeth, right?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.381
If you don't, they'll rot.

36:57.674 --> 36:58.967
You've beautiful teeth.

37:03.513 --> 37:04.513
Ok

37:09.978 --> 37:12.522
My jacket is coming down, ok?

37:13.940 --> 37:14.940
You got it?

37:18.695 --> 37:22.240
I can bring you anything else you
want, sweetheart, ok?

37:30.707 --> 37:31.707
I'll be back soon

39:34.289 --> 39:35.790
Where are you?

39:36.124 --> 39:39.377
I'm in Angela's house...
to be exact in Annie's room.

39:40.003 --> 39:42.088
I got those pictures you sent me.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.090
Where did you find them?

39:44.382 --> 39:47.844
I was putting my clothes in the closet...

39:49.137 --> 39:52.223
and I found some really weird
things that belonged to Annie

39:52.932 --> 39:55.226
The files are encrypted,

39:55.518 --> 39:57.061
I'll need time do convert them,

39:57.353 --> 39:59.606
but I did some research on the picture.

40:00.189 --> 40:03.234
Those people are part of a cult.

40:03.526 --> 40:10.074
Their leader is an 85 year-old
woman they call the Grandmother.

40:10.742 --> 40:12.035
But it goes deeper,

40:12.785 --> 40:15.163
they've been financed by a company:

40:15.997 --> 40:17.290
Lumen corp.

40:18.082 --> 40:22.086
I want to tell Angela ...but..
I don't know if she knows or not.

40:22.378 --> 40:24.297
No, Don't do that...

40:29.427 --> 40:33.890
I know... I know there is a connection between
Angela's stalkers and what happened to Annie

40:35.058 --> 40:38.728
Maybe, or maybe nobody is stalking Angela,

40:40.688 --> 40:42.357
maybe she is delusional.

40:43.191 --> 40:48.988
Do you really think someone broke in to
Angela's house just to steal Annie's doll?

40:49.280 --> 40:57.280
I'm trying to not be influenced by suggestion... but I
think that some really strange things happened to Annie.

40:57.872 --> 40:59.248
You are right to be wary,

41:01.084 --> 41:03.378
some of those people in the picture

41:04.545 --> 41:08.883
died this week, in a most brutal manner.

41:09.175 --> 41:12.679
Perhaps those involved in Annie's tragedy

41:13.638 --> 41:15.556
don't take kindly to witnesses...

41:16.224 --> 41:19.394
or maybe someone is out to avenge Annie...

41:20.269 --> 41:21.688
maybe it's Angela.

41:44.002 --> 41:45.420
Is that all Detective?

41:45.878 --> 41:49.882
Yes, just bring those papers
to General Strainer...

41:50.675 --> 41:58.016
Hey!! HEY!! Go straight to the
headquarters, ok? Don't stop for any reason

42:33.760 --> 42:36.763
Are you doing those fucking rituals again?

42:37.638 --> 42:41.809
I covered for you with that Annie
Red thing, but I won't do that again.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.312
Listen... LISTEN!!!

42:45.104 --> 42:50.401
Maybe you haven't noticed
yet: BUT WAR IS COMING!!!

42:50.943 --> 42:54.906
If they find out I was involved,
it's a court martial for me...

42:55.490 --> 42:57.867
they don't waste time with trials anymore

42:58.910 --> 43:02.663
If I find another body in the streets,

43:03.164 --> 43:08.377
I'll come after you and I'll put
a bullet in your fucking head.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.049
I know it's you, Don't fuck with me!!!

43:16.219 --> 43:17.219
This...

43:19.889 --> 43:23.851
this is an Interview I
did with Detective Costa.

43:25.686 --> 43:28.898
Just listen to how he answered my questions

43:29.232 --> 43:32.902
Yes, you heard me,
we can't find the girl's body.

43:33.194 --> 43:36.030
The pit is connected to
an underground river.

43:36.322 --> 43:39.659
We believe she was dragged
away by the current

43:39.951 --> 43:41.452
One more question, detective

43:41.744 --> 43:44.622
If you'll excuse me,
we are extremely busy right now

43:44.914 --> 43:46.833
So you basically left her die!!!!

43:47.125 --> 43:53.339
Listen to me very carefully dickhead,
I'm not obliged to answer your questions...

43:53.673 --> 43:57.718
I was gracious enough to
tolerate your bullshit,

43:58.094 --> 44:02.098
this interview is fucking over...

44:02.390 --> 44:03.390
You see?

44:04.934 --> 44:09.897
You see now why I believe
Annie's death was no accident!

44:36.465 --> 44:37.465
Hey

46:02.718 --> 46:03.718
Angela

46:06.973 --> 46:07.973
Hello

46:08.724 --> 46:10.643
Oh my God, what happened to you?

46:12.186 --> 46:13.186
I had a problem...

46:13.854 --> 46:14.854
Where have you been?

46:15.815 --> 46:17.358
I wanted go to the supermarket...

46:18.651 --> 46:21.651
a driver almost ran me over... I fell
to the ground, but fortunately I'm ok

46:23.739 --> 46:24.907
You lost your jacket...

46:26.033 --> 46:27.576
Yes I know...

46:29.662 --> 46:31.289
Did you set your things in Annie's room?

46:33.624 --> 46:35.584
I put them on the couch.
There wasn't enough room

46:37.503 --> 46:39.422
Yeah... I haven't used
that closet in a while

46:40.256 --> 46:43.509
Angela, there are some
things I found on there

46:45.886 --> 46:46.887
What kind of things?

46:48.681 --> 46:50.321
I think you should see with your own eyes

46:51.142 --> 46:55.146
Ok but not now.
I need to take a shower, I'm disgusting.

47:24.258 --> 47:27.094
The things I took for granted
are those that I miss most.

47:29.638 --> 47:31.557
I miss you calling me "Little Red".

47:34.101 --> 47:35.144
But I'm not sad,

47:40.775 --> 47:42.276
I'm pissed off...

47:52.078 --> 47:56.290
If there is a God, I would bash his fucking
face in for what he has done to our family.

48:04.882 --> 48:06.425
Annie wrote that letter to her father

48:11.764 --> 48:13.140
I also found this...

48:17.686 --> 48:19.686
she must have been a member
of some kind of cult...

48:20.523 --> 48:21.774
Did you know any of them?

48:23.901 --> 48:25.403
She stopped talking to me.

48:26.404 --> 48:28.072
She hated me.

48:29.865 --> 48:34.620
She was convinced that her father
left because I couldn't hold him here.

48:36.747 --> 48:40.292
I guess it was easier for her
to accept that it was my fault.

48:40.626 --> 48:43.003
She didn't really hate you, Angela

48:43.462 --> 48:47.216
You know, once she said to me that she
knew she didn't mean anything to me.

48:47.508 --> 48:51.011
She said: "Mom, if you had to choose",

48:51.887 --> 48:56.892
you'll put me on the side of the road so it's
easier for you to abandon me without any issue"

49:00.354 --> 49:02.273
My own daughter said that to me.

49:03.232 --> 49:05.860
She was manipulated by those people,

49:06.360 --> 49:08.863
probably the same people
that are stalking you now

49:09.697 --> 49:11.615
Diane, the truth is right in front of you.

49:12.908 --> 49:14.827
It is exactly like you are seeing it

49:16.412 --> 49:17.413
What do you mean?

49:32.970 --> 49:33.970
I'm here.

49:35.139 --> 49:36.724
I cooked breakfast for you

49:39.310 --> 49:40.686
Come, sit, eat something

49:41.061 --> 49:42.688
To be honest, I'm not that hungry

49:44.732 --> 49:47.193
You're anxious to go to the police I bet...

49:47.902 --> 49:49.487
Of course, aren't you?

49:50.946 --> 49:54.742
We know how I feel about it...
doesn't matter... at least drink this.

50:00.206 --> 50:02.124
Didn't you sleep at all last night?

50:04.168 --> 50:05.461
Maybe a couple of hours

50:09.089 --> 50:11.008
You need to relax before leaving

50:15.804 --> 50:18.432
No, I wanna resolve this now

50:20.976 --> 50:22.895
It will be a very long story,

50:27.650 --> 50:29.860
we will spend all day
at the police station.

50:34.198 --> 50:35.282
What it's 6 now?

50:36.534 --> 50:37.534
Let's go at 7.

50:38.160 --> 50:39.787
Give yourself an hour of sleep

50:44.500 --> 50:47.545
Ok, but no more than an hour

50:48.879 --> 50:50.381
No, no more than one hour,

50:53.592 --> 50:55.177
you're so tired aren't you.

50:58.472 --> 51:00.391
Come,

51:02.017 --> 51:03.227
get some rest,

51:04.103 --> 51:05.354
you'll feel better soon.

51:25.416 --> 51:26.416
I'm sorry

51:32.798 --> 51:33.798
Annie, I'm back

51:45.227 --> 51:47.771
Mom is here... Mom is here

51:50.024 --> 51:51.275
Can you hear me?

51:54.153 --> 51:55.321
Can you hear me?

51:57.573 --> 51:59.199
I knew it was you,

52:01.160 --> 52:03.078
I knew it was you, I knew it was you,

52:13.797 --> 52:14.965
Mom is here

52:38.989 --> 52:39.989
Mom is here

55:23.070 --> 55:24.070
Diane

55:24.404 --> 55:25.404
You have to look at this

55:25.656 --> 55:26.656
...Angela?

55:26.865 --> 55:27.865
Diane

55:29.701 --> 55:30.701
I don't feel well,

55:32.538 --> 55:34.456
I'm really thirsty,
I need something to drink

55:40.295 --> 55:41.672
Do you feel better now?

55:42.297 --> 55:43.297
Not really.

55:53.392 --> 55:54.393
Angelaaa!!!!

55:56.311 --> 55:59.106
Look, you are not crazy, alright?

56:00.357 --> 56:04.528
Yes you've been stalked, and they want
you to believe that Annie is still alive.

56:05.821 --> 56:07.531
We have got to go to the police

56:09.992 --> 56:10.992
Look at me

56:15.372 --> 56:17.082
You don't wanna help me

56:17.833 --> 56:19.167
What are you saying?

56:21.336 --> 56:26.091
Oh I see, you want a friend
to be a shoulder to cry on.

56:27.050 --> 56:31.513
Well I'm sorry, I'm not just gonna
be one of those fucking fake friends.

56:31.847 --> 56:34.308
Don't play Superwoman with me Diane

56:34.766 --> 56:35.766
What do you mean?

56:37.853 --> 56:39.438
I lost my head for my husband.

56:40.898 --> 56:42.190
I loved him,

56:44.026 --> 56:45.527
and then one day he looked at me

56:46.528 --> 56:49.281
in a strange way,
a way I can't describe now.

56:49.990 --> 56:50.990
Look at me

56:51.617 --> 56:52.617
He smiled,

56:53.201 --> 56:56.079
and I said: "is everything ok?"

56:57.497 --> 56:58.916
and he said "Yeah, of course".

57:01.084 --> 57:05.672
In that exact moment, I knew. And you?

57:07.549 --> 57:08.549
What?

57:09.801 --> 57:11.595
That Michael was seeing another woman

57:12.763 --> 57:15.682
It took you a long time to
recognize his real intentions.

57:16.808 --> 57:18.727
I guess you weren't that
much in love with him.

57:21.521 --> 57:23.899
You have no right to say that to me

57:25.025 --> 57:28.070
You just wanted to feel the pleasure
of stealing him from another woman.

58:30.090 --> 58:38.090
When the Wolf's blood contaminates the dead flesh of its victims, it will
deceive us sinners with the illusion that the corpse is alive once more.

59:11.757 --> 59:14.134
It's still too strong

59:34.404 --> 59:36.323
This morning I found a letter from Dad

59:37.866 --> 59:39.117
He left in the box,

59:40.410 --> 59:41.453
next to mine

59:43.163 --> 59:45.082
That means he must've been here last night

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.021
Diane

01:00:09.856 --> 01:00:11.191
as soon as you see this,

01:00:12.234 --> 01:00:13.234
leave town,

01:00:14.194 --> 01:00:15.195
build a new life.

01:00:17.697 --> 01:00:19.407
I fucked up bad...

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:22.202
I fucked up pretty bad this time,

01:00:22.911 --> 01:00:25.831
I should never have stuck
my nose in this mess.

01:00:45.433 --> 01:00:47.352
You threw her in that pit.

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:56.319
You are blind to the truth.

01:00:56.945 --> 01:01:04.369
If by "throwing her into the pit" you
mean performing the Abominatio ritual,

01:01:04.661 --> 01:01:08.290
then yes, we are indeed guilty.

01:01:08.999 --> 01:01:09.999
However,

01:01:11.585 --> 01:01:15.005
we did only what was necessary

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:19.718
to eradicate the curse she
inherited from her father.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:26.766
The ritual demanded that we
must slice her flesh 33 times,

01:01:27.475 --> 01:01:30.604
contort her body with sacred ropes,

01:01:31.146 --> 01:01:34.941
anoint her with Saint Gervase's Oil,

01:01:35.942 --> 01:01:37.068
and finally

01:01:38.069 --> 01:01:41.364
toss her body into the holy pit.

01:01:42.991 --> 01:01:45.577
By completing the ritual,

01:01:46.328 --> 01:01:49.998
we have succeeded in halting the bloodline.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:57.297
Unfortunately, we failed to do the
same for her father, 6 years ago.

01:02:37.379 --> 01:02:43.718
Those plagued by the Wolf's curse
must become masters of mimicry,

01:02:44.010 --> 01:02:49.975
not least in the curse's final stages
when it distorts their features.

01:02:50.684 --> 01:02:54.646
Before his victims died,
they were each convinced

01:02:54.938 --> 01:02:58.775
that they were in the
presence of a gentle soul.

01:03:05.907 --> 01:03:08.827
But that thing, he is not your friend.

01:03:09.202 --> 01:03:11.663
He is naught but a beast.

01:03:12.914 --> 01:03:18.420
He is Angela's husband and
you are ensnared in his trap.

01:03:20.880 --> 01:03:26.177
You cannot begin to envisage
what that monster is capable of.

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:33.601
He displayed compassion and humanity only
when he forsook Angela and her daughter

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:39.107
so as to shield them from
the threat he himself posed.

01:03:41.067 --> 01:03:43.403
He is avenging his daughter

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:47.991
even though he is truly to
blame for her demise.

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:52.996
He slaughtered her classmates,
for tormenting her.

01:03:54.122 --> 01:04:00.587
Then, Detective Costa: for
conspiring to conceal our rituals.

01:04:01.171 --> 01:04:07.260
Your lover, Michael: for causing
the rift between you and Angela.

01:04:07.552 --> 01:04:15.552
And of course you Diane, because you
abandoned his wife when she needed you most.

01:04:16.061 --> 01:04:19.397
But don't worry,
you will be bait for the Wolf.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:27.689
You should be honoured, because your sacrifice
will help us to banish the beast for all eternity.

01:04:49.135 --> 01:04:50.345
Help me!

01:04:52.305 --> 01:04:54.933
He has stolen my beautiful robes...

01:04:55.392 --> 01:04:56.976
IT'S HERE!!!!

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:16.079
Kill it!!!

01:09:53.064 --> 01:09:57.902
People will hunt you down just
because they don't understand you.

01:09:58.611 --> 01:10:03.574
They will call you monster, and they will
cut you to the bone, scarring you forever.

01:10:04.158 --> 01:10:06.953
Eventually you will start
seeing a monster in the mirror,

01:10:07.453 --> 01:10:11.833
And you will hate that monster
more than anyone or anything else.

01:10:12.750 --> 01:10:15.878
But even if you think there is
nothing left in you to love,

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:21.092
The echo of your first
smiles will always remain

01:10:21.843 --> 01:10:25.555
Impressed in the hearts of those
who loved you unconditionally

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:27.640
me and your Mom.

01:10:29.350 --> 01:10:30.727
You will live in me

01:10:31.602 --> 01:10:33.521
Until the end of time.
