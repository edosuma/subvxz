WEBVTT

01:08.360 --> 01:10.408
I went to that wedding...

01:10.571 --> 01:12.790
a couple of days ago and I...

01:12.948 --> 01:16.202
I tell you, I couldn't stop
thinking about you.

01:17.828 --> 01:20.047
You know, about us, ahem...

01:20.205 --> 01:23.550
up there together.

01:23.709 --> 01:25.586
You're my best friend.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.722
And, uh, I...

01:28.880 --> 01:31.099
well, love you.

01:41.643 --> 01:42.815
Oh.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.155
Will you marry me?

01:47.065 --> 01:49.193
Oh, it's so sweet of you to ask.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.831
Congratulations.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.799
Okay. Well...

02:07.961 --> 02:10.214
- ...have a good one.
- You too.

02:11.798 --> 02:13.926
<i>Proposing to a girl I never met...</i>

02:14.092 --> 02:16.345
<i>Well, after everything
I've been through...</i>

02:16.511 --> 02:18.730
<i>it really didn't seem that strange.</i>

02:19.222 --> 02:21.145
<i>Now Jessica knew everything...</i>

02:21.308 --> 02:23.731
<i>what I did and who I was.</i>

02:23.894 --> 02:26.067
<i>And you know what?
The world didn't end.</i>

02:27.230 --> 02:28.948
<i>So I had to ask myself:</i>

02:29.107 --> 02:31.405
<i>If everyone's got their destiny...</i>

02:31.568 --> 02:33.662
<i>was this mine?</i>

02:33.820 --> 02:35.697
Can I help you?

02:36.323 --> 02:37.495
Can I help you?

02:37.658 --> 02:40.207
- What are you doing?
- You must be Ray Drecker...

02:40.369 --> 02:43.794
- ...business partner.
- Who are you'? Where is Tanya?

02:43.955 --> 02:45.753
She ran out of here all upset.

02:47.334 --> 02:49.302
I don't know what racket
you got going...

02:49.461 --> 02:51.634
but if you wanna look
at really good pussy...

02:51.797 --> 02:54.391
scroll through the pictures
on my husband's phone.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.223
Who the hell are you?
What are you doing here?

02:57.844 --> 03:00.723
"On April 28th, 2011

03:00.889 --> 03:04.018
Ms. Tanya Skagle engaged
Always Quick Bail Bonds...

03:04.184 --> 03:09.532
to post bail for a Mr. Charles St. John
in the amount of $40,000."

03:09.690 --> 03:12.785
- Forty thousand dollars?
- "Mr. St. John's violated his bail.

03:12.943 --> 03:17.039
<i>Ms. Skagle's listed assets are
Happiness Consultants For Women, L.L.C...</i>

03:17.197 --> 03:19.825
- Come on, Tanya.
- ...but not limited to the contents...

03:19.991 --> 03:22.460
of physical plant therein.“

03:22.744 --> 03:23.791
We're taking her shit.

03:37.843 --> 03:39.561
- Tanya!
- Oh, God.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.472
Go away!

03:43.932 --> 03:46.026
Tanya, open the door.

03:46.184 --> 03:48.152
I said go away.

03:48.311 --> 03:51.565
Open the door! Open the door!

03:51.732 --> 03:53.575
God! Go away, Ray!

03:53.734 --> 03:55.611
Get the hell out of here!

04:03.910 --> 04:05.628
Tanya!

04:05.787 --> 04:07.334
All right, then.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.336
Tanya!

04:12.502 --> 04:14.425
Ray, keep it down. Go away!

04:14.588 --> 04:16.807
- You sold out the business!
- Go away.

04:16.964 --> 04:20.265
You bet the wellness center
on a fricking pimp?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.803
- Yeah.
- That's half mine!

04:21.970 --> 04:23.847
I am taking care of it.

04:24.014 --> 04:27.564
I'm raising the money.
I am selling my record collection on eBay.

04:27.726 --> 04:30.946
My Dark Side of the Moon
has started a bidding war.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.947
We owe $40,000, Tanya.

04:33.106 --> 04:35.905
- You're selling records?
- It might work, all right?

04:36.067 --> 04:38.741
I don't need your I-told-you-sos
right now.

04:38.904 --> 04:42.499
No, no, no, you don't get to fix
the problem by yourself, little lady.

04:42.657 --> 04:45.206
It's my problem too.
I'm coming up there, Skagle!

04:45.368 --> 04:46.961
You're crazy. You're fucking nuts!

04:47.120 --> 04:49.999
Ray, stop with the Rapunzel crap.
Stay down.

04:50.165 --> 04:52.293
You're gonna get me evicted.
I swear to God.

04:52.459 --> 04:54.382
- You're making me.
- Ray, I swear to God.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.922
You can climb one more step
and I'm gonna... Uhn!

04:58.465 --> 05:02.390
Ah! I'm sorry. Watch that spot.
The wood's rotted.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.099
Come here!
- All right. Stop it!

05:04.262 --> 05:05.980
- I said stop it.
- You know what?

05:06.139 --> 05:09.234
We've got till 3:00 Wednesday afternoon
or we're done!

05:09.392 --> 05:11.065
- You're an asshole!
- I'm the asshole?

05:11.228 --> 05:14.653
Well, why did you have to sell out
the business to a fricking pimp?

05:14.815 --> 05:17.193
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know why, Ray.

05:17.359 --> 05:19.202
- Because I'm an idiot, that's why.
- Yeah.

05:19.361 --> 05:21.455
You know why? Because it was working!

05:21.613 --> 05:24.708
It was working, Skagle!
It was finally starting to work:

05:24.866 --> 05:26.868
The wellness center, the classes.

05:27.035 --> 05:29.629
- You said that it was hooey!
- You were right!

05:29.788 --> 05:31.790
You were right, okay?

05:31.957 --> 05:33.425
A lot of those women are happy.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.838
Happier than when
they showed up anyway.

05:38.964 --> 05:40.136
- Okay.
- Yeah...

05:40.298 --> 05:43.051
You want me to say it?
We're making money, all right?

05:43.218 --> 05:45.596
Because of you. You did it.

05:46.721 --> 05:47.893
You did it.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.070
There, I said it.

06:04.573 --> 06:06.621
Tanya, I don't have anything else.

06:06.783 --> 06:09.662
I can say I'm a teacher,
but I haven't subbed in three months.

06:09.828 --> 06:14.379
This is it. This is all I got.

06:16.167 --> 06:18.590
Well, I don't know what to do.

06:18.753 --> 06:21.472
We're gonna find Charlie
and we're gonna get our shit back.

06:21.631 --> 06:25.056
We'll get our money.
We'll get it done. Together.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.980
You wanted to see me, Dr. Kopylov?

06:34.185 --> 06:36.563
Yes, Jessica Haxon. Uh...

06:36.730 --> 06:38.027
Come in.

06:38.607 --> 06:40.575
It's about the urine.

06:46.489 --> 06:48.537
This is not Mr. Patsourakas'.

06:48.825 --> 06:52.125
Oh. Okay. Whose is it, then?

06:52.287 --> 06:55.712
You tell me. It says Mr. Patsourakas
on the label you applied...

06:55.874 --> 06:58.252
but it turns out there's estrogen
in the sample.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.670
You know what that means?

07:01.004 --> 07:04.224
It's Mrs. Patsourakas'?

07:04.382 --> 07:07.352
She's deceased.
But this is a female sample.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.229
Now I understand
sometimes urine spills. I get it.

07:10.388 --> 07:14.438
But the correct thing to do
is just be upfront about this.

07:15.852 --> 07:18.230
You think I peed into that cup?

07:18.396 --> 07:20.148
We'll never know, will we?

07:20.315 --> 07:24.240
But you did mix up the samples
and that is a cause for termination.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.572
- What?
- Jessi ca...

07:26.738 --> 07:29.617
I cannot run my office
like a hot-dog stand.

07:29.783 --> 07:33.538
"Ketchup, mustard? Who cares?"
I'm sorry.

07:33.703 --> 07:36.081
This is extremely hard for me.

07:36.790 --> 07:39.259
We gave it a shot and it didn't work out.

07:40.126 --> 07:42.003
No hard feelings...

07:42.462 --> 07:44.464
on my part, anywaY...

07:46.633 --> 07:48.556
I told you if you would just get waxed...

07:48.718 --> 07:51.096
you wouldn't even have razors
in the house.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.936
Wait, hold on one second.
I'm getting another call.

07:54.099 --> 07:57.399
Hello. This is the Wild Oaks Suicide
Prevention Center. How can I help you?

07:57.560 --> 07:59.938
<i>Hey. I'm calling because I'm...</i>

08:00.105 --> 08:01.903
<i>I'm in a bad place.</i>

08:02.482 --> 08:06.112
<i>- Who am I speaking to?
- ALF.</i>

08:06.277 --> 08:08.575
Okay, ALF.

08:09.197 --> 08:12.542
- What's on your mind?
- I letdown a friend.

08:13.910 --> 08:16.880
<i>This woman is...
She's really important to me.</i>

08:17.914 --> 08:20.713
Why do you think you did it, ALF?

08:20.875 --> 08:24.254
- I was stupid.
- Did you try apologizing?

08:24.421 --> 08:26.765
I did. She didn't accept it.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.935
Have you tried fucking her?

08:33.346 --> 08:34.643
Oh, fuck.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.479
- I'm sorry.
- Say it again.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.315
I'm so fucking sorry, Lenore.

08:39.602 --> 08:41.024
- Are you really sorry?
- Yes.

08:41.187 --> 08:43.986
- Really, really sorry?
- Oh, yes!

08:44.149 --> 08:46.777
- Oh! Oh, what's wrong?
- I can't do it, Jason.

08:46.943 --> 08:48.240
Why? Why not? Why not?

08:48.403 --> 08:51.748
- You burned me too many times.
- I'm not gonna do it again. I promise.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.908
It wasn't just business for me, Jason.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.498
I had faith in you. I believed in you.

08:56.661 --> 08:59.460
- I was gonna make you the best.
- I want to be the best.

08:59.622 --> 09:01.670
I want you to make me the best.

09:01.833 --> 09:03.835
It was supposed to be
the two of us, Jason.

09:04.002 --> 09:05.675
- Fred and Ginger.
- Mm-hm.

09:05.837 --> 09:07.430
- Bonnie and Clyde.
- Uh-huh.

09:07.589 --> 09:08.715
- You and me.
- Oh.

09:08.882 --> 09:10.930
So why can't it be like that?

09:11.092 --> 09:14.062
You let the wrong people
into your heart and I can't trust you.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.724
So, what can I do?
How do I make you trust me again?

09:18.308 --> 09:21.187
Lenore, what can I do?

09:26.858 --> 09:28.280
- Parking spot, parking spot.
I...

09:28.443 --> 09:31.697
Just passed a parking spot.
Perfectly good one, by the way.

09:34.866 --> 09:37.540
- Pshew. Jesus, it smells bad.
- Ray, could you lock...

09:37.702 --> 09:39.545
- Just lock the door. It's a lane!
- Okay.

09:39.704 --> 09:42.207
I spilled a latte! Lock the car.
Lock the door, please.

09:42.373 --> 09:44.501
Wouldn't want the smell to get away.

09:44.667 --> 09:48.547
- Just keep it in there.
- Look, stop making fun of my car.

09:48.713 --> 09:52.013
It's reliable transportation.
You're the one with the broken Mustang...

09:52.175 --> 09:55.179
Mr. Mid-Life-Crisis car,
you never gave your kids, by the way.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.847
I'm still giving it to my kids.

09:57.013 --> 09:59.266
- Yeah.
- What are we doing? I'm not going in here.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.150
- You talk to her.
- This was your idea.

10:01.351 --> 10:05.106
That doesn't mean I have to go talk to her.
I don't wanna talk to her ever again.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.694
- Don't be a jerk.
- What are we doing at a restaurant?

10:07.857 --> 10:09.404
Don't be such a jerk.

10:09.567 --> 10:13.697
She ran the plates for us, Ray. She's a cop.
She is not gonna meet us at the cop station.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.115
I know she's a cop.

10:15.281 --> 10:18.125
She wanted to meet us somewhere
where she doesn't know anyone.

10:21.204 --> 10:23.878
- All right, I'll... I'll wait here.
- No.

10:24.040 --> 10:26.589
- Just... You know what?
- I'm gonna wait in the car.

10:26.751 --> 10:28.048
Hi.

10:29.462 --> 10:32.056
We're normal, okay? We're normal.
We're normal citizens.

10:32.215 --> 10:33.933
- Hi, Tanya. Hi, Ray.
- We're fine.

10:34.384 --> 10:38.890
Hi, Lydia. Okay, we gotta get
Charlie's address, okay?

10:39.055 --> 10:40.682
Act normal.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.443
- Hi.
- Hi. Why don't you have a seat?

10:43.601 --> 10:45.603
- Want a margarita?
- We can't right now.

10:45.770 --> 10:47.772
We're kind of in a hurry,
but we came to...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.987
We wanted to get that thing. Sorry.

10:50.150 --> 10:54.451
Oh. You don't wanna hang out?
So I just do stuff for you...

10:54.612 --> 10:55.738
and you blow me off?

10:58.199 --> 10:59.701
Everybody, these are my friends.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.838
This is Tanya and Ray,
the best pimp and ho in Detroit.

11:04.873 --> 11:06.671
It's just... That's a figure of speech.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.506
Pimp, ho.

11:08.668 --> 11:10.386
Guess which one's the ho?

11:13.506 --> 11:16.134
Relax. Don't take shit so seriously.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.520
I'm just fucking with you.

11:18.803 --> 11:20.305
Here.

11:21.431 --> 11:23.274
What do you say, Ray?

11:25.435 --> 11:27.153
Thank you?

11:27.312 --> 11:28.780
So nice.

11:30.899 --> 11:32.867
Okay. Bye-bye. Thank you.

11:33.026 --> 11:36.951
That's it, we're done. We are over!

11:37.113 --> 11:38.581
This is it.

11:39.991 --> 11:41.868
It's a full breakup right now.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.835
Sandee, I wanna talk to you
and I want you to listen, okay?

11:49.000 --> 11:51.173
Hi, Mr. Ferris, Carol.

11:51.711 --> 11:56.012
- Is everything okay?
- Nana died, Jason.

11:56.174 --> 11:57.892
She died in the tub.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.769
Oh, no.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.772
She fell?
No, she just died in the tub.

12:03.973 --> 12:05.475
What, Nana was...

12:05.642 --> 12:08.191
- She was great.
- We were looking at caskets.

12:08.353 --> 12:12.529
We were thinking maybe that one.
The walnut?

12:13.191 --> 12:16.661
Jason, can you take out the trash?
Because it's starting to stink in here.

12:31.501 --> 12:33.629
I could really use your help in here.

12:33.795 --> 12:36.048
Please. Sandee?

12:46.891 --> 12:48.564
I know this is really...

12:48.726 --> 12:52.026
it's not...
This is not the best timing right now...

12:52.188 --> 12:55.067
but I need some time.

12:56.025 --> 12:59.120
- What?
- Like a... Like a break.

12:59.279 --> 13:02.658
Or a timeout.
Just permanent timeout.

13:02.824 --> 13:06.078
You're breaking up with me?

13:06.661 --> 13:10.416
- Nana is gone and you're dumping me?
- It's not you.

13:11.082 --> 13:13.084
It's Lenore, isn't it?

13:13.251 --> 13:17.472
- Sweetheart, just calm down.
- I am grieving.

13:18.256 --> 13:21.556
What's wrong?
- He is breaking up with me.

13:21.718 --> 13:22.810
What? Jason.

13:22.969 --> 13:25.848
What the hell's wrong with you?
My mother is dead.

13:30.101 --> 13:33.981
I got you a Disney travel package...

13:34.147 --> 13:38.903
and there's a ﬂight, there's a hotel
and there's a three-day Park Hopper pass...

13:39.068 --> 13:42.288
that you can use
as soon as you're ready.

13:49.245 --> 13:51.873
Sweetie. My baby doll.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.883
Did Charlie ever say anything about a farm?

13:54.042 --> 13:55.760
God, Ray, I would remember a farm.

13:55.918 --> 13:59.422
I'm telling you, Tanya,
this is the road. The map's pretty clear.

13:59.589 --> 14:04.937
- 5158, 5160... Right there!
- What'? Wait, wait, wait.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.222
- That place?
- Fuck.

14:07.388 --> 14:10.232
Put it on the grass.
Down on the right, down on the right.

14:10.391 --> 14:12.314
- Down on the right.
- I got it, I got it!

14:12.477 --> 14:15.105
- No, you don't.
- Jesus, I'll drive, all right'?

14:15.271 --> 14:19.026
- Now you're parked in the middle of the road.
- It's a country road!

14:19.192 --> 14:21.866
What, you're gonna put money
in the meter?

14:22.028 --> 14:23.075
Jesus.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.080
5160, this is it?

14:29.702 --> 14:31.124
Lydia is fucking with you.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.540
- There's no way this guy lives out here.
- I gotta pee.

14:38.252 --> 14:39.378
Wow.

14:41.214 --> 14:42.932
- Fuck! Ray, get down, get down!
- What?

14:43.091 --> 14:46.345
It's Missy. It's Charlie's girlfriend, Ray.

14:47.011 --> 14:49.139
Okay. Well, that settles that.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.558
God. All right, so now what do we do?

14:51.724 --> 14:55.445
We're in the middle of bumblefuck
Michigan and we've got no plan.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.734
Look at these cows.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.945
Look at this color. That's beefalo.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.361
You know, these are like
3, 4 grand a pop.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.121
Ray, how do you know
so much about cows?

15:05.279 --> 15:07.281
I'm a man, Tanya.
I know all kinds of shit.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.451
Come on, we need a truck.

15:11.494 --> 15:12.791
A truck for what?

15:12.954 --> 15:14.672
- He owes us 40 grand.
- Ray.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.630
Ten, 12 of those suckers,
we're in the clear.

15:17.792 --> 15:20.636
- I'm driving. Come on!
- Ray.

15:21.045 --> 15:23.423
No, we're not stealing cows.

15:23.589 --> 15:26.468
- Get in the car, Skagle.
- I'm not doing it.

15:26.634 --> 15:29.513
Ray, we're not... We're not stealing cows.

15:29.679 --> 15:31.056
Come on.

15:33.224 --> 15:34.942
I said... Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!

15:35.101 --> 15:37.354
Stop! Ray, that's my car.

15:42.024 --> 15:45.528
Could you please turn the music down?

16:09.177 --> 16:13.273
Listen, gnu little shit, turn it clown
or I'll shove this up your ass!

16:13.431 --> 16:16.355
Fuck you! You're the worst neighbors
in the whole world!

16:16.517 --> 16:18.064
Turn it down!

16:19.645 --> 16:21.067
Thank you!

16:40.082 --> 16:41.459
Jessica.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.754
What are you doing here?

16:45.838 --> 16:48.967
Jessica. Jessica, wait.

16:49.634 --> 16:53.229
Why don't we take fingerprints?
Find out who else touched that sample?

16:53.387 --> 16:55.435
What are you talking about?
We're not CSI.

16:55.598 --> 16:59.068
Maybe they did it. Or maybe Mindy
came in and peed in the cup.

16:59.227 --> 17:01.070
Patsy, could you please escort her out?

17:01.229 --> 17:03.402
Just so you know,
since you already fired me...

17:03.564 --> 17:07.819
and you can't fire me twice,
you are the worst lay I have ever had.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.284
He sings while he screws, ladies.

17:10.445 --> 17:12.618
Oh, yes, show tunes.

17:12.781 --> 17:16.286
And he's got a foot fetish,
which is really fucked up...

17:16.452 --> 17:18.750
for the husband of a podiatrist.

17:18.913 --> 17:20.665
I don't need your crap anymore, Matt.

17:20.830 --> 17:24.256
I have three dependants and an ex-husband
I just found out is...

17:24.417 --> 17:29.470
Ha-ha. He is not a substitute teacher.
But I would rather clean toilets...

17:29.632 --> 17:32.806
than spend another minute
in here with you.

17:32.969 --> 17:35.848
Go back to your exam,
but remember you sexually harassed me...

17:36.013 --> 17:38.436
and then you fired me.
I want a severance package.

17:38.599 --> 17:41.523
And a bonus. Have a good fucking day.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.654
Are you doing security or not, Patsy?

17:49.360 --> 17:50.657
It's my birthday girl.

17:50.820 --> 17:51.867
That's a good girl.

17:52.154 --> 17:55.784
Patty? I got it.
Yes, that's a good girl, birthday girl.

17:57.326 --> 17:58.669
Who is it, Patty?

17:58.828 --> 18:00.375
Is that the Chinese delivery man?

18:00.538 --> 18:04.259
Is that our kung pao chicken?
Is that our kung pao chicken?

18:07.169 --> 18:08.921
I thought you went to Disney World.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.590
I'm here.

18:11.299 --> 18:13.643
Is that your dog? I love dogs.

18:14.176 --> 18:16.224
How did you get into
the building, Sandee?

18:16.387 --> 18:18.435
I don't wanna fight you anymore.

18:18.598 --> 18:20.771
Jason is destined for bigger things...

18:20.933 --> 18:24.278
and I know that you can
take him there, so I'm letting go.

18:25.187 --> 18:27.110
Here, this is for you. it's...

18:27.273 --> 18:28.946
it's a present.

18:29.817 --> 18:32.946
- That's very mature of you. Thank you.
- Open it.

18:37.867 --> 18:40.336
"Bang"? That's stupid.
I don't get it.

18:41.495 --> 18:42.542
What the fuck?

18:48.919 --> 18:51.013
Okay. Okay, come on, Daisy.

18:51.172 --> 18:52.549
Come on, girl.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.347
Hey.

18:56.177 --> 18:57.394
What?

18:58.846 --> 19:00.439
- Come on! Just...
- I know.

19:01.057 --> 19:02.104
Just kick it.

19:02.266 --> 19:04.064
- It's asleep.
- It'll wake up.

19:04.226 --> 19:06.149
Hey, come here!

19:06.979 --> 19:09.607
- Okay, come on. Come on. Come on, girl.
- Get in here.

19:09.774 --> 19:11.321
Come on, Daisy. Come on.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.912
Ah! Ray!

19:21.077 --> 19:22.704
- We're gonna get shot.
- Keep moving.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.713
- We're not in the city, Ray.
- Keep going.

19:24.872 --> 19:27.842
In the city, you get shot, it's illegal.
In the country, you just get shot.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.595
Shh! No one's gonna get shot.
Hey. Just... Come on, you big bovine.

19:31.754 --> 19:33.597
- Come here!
- You're hurting him, Ray.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.975
- Come here! Ouch!
- God, give me the...

19:36.425 --> 19:38.302
- God.
- I got it, I got it, Ray.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.846
Give me...

19:41.055 --> 19:42.272
Hey!
- Fuck!

19:42.431 --> 19:44.354
What the fuck you doing with my cows?

19:44.517 --> 19:45.609
Shit, Ray.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.112
- Charlie.
- Yeah, I'm gonna ask you again:

19:48.479 --> 19:52.575
What the fuck are doing with my cows?

19:52.733 --> 19:56.237
All right, we're taking your cows, okay?

19:56.404 --> 19:59.624
- It's a payback.
- I told you I'd get the money back to you.

19:59.782 --> 20:02.410
- I gave you my word.
- Yeah?

20:02.576 --> 20:04.499
Well, your word is shit, Charlie.

20:04.662 --> 20:07.381
Look, these are my motherfucking cows.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.918
I need you to put them back
in the motherfucking stable...

20:10.084 --> 20:11.757
so they can eat
some motherfucking grass.

20:11.919 --> 20:13.637
Then I want you
to get the fuck out.

20:13.796 --> 20:17.141
Don't talk to her like that, okay?
We're gonna take 10 of your cows.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.853
- Okay? And then we're gonna call it even.
- Daisy.

20:21.011 --> 20:24.766
- No. And this don't even concern you.
- Yeah, it does concern me.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.435
All right? Tanya took a chance on you.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.024
- You fucked her over.
- Tanya and I...

20:30.187 --> 20:33.316
we have an arrangement.
And it worked out fine for both of us.

20:33.482 --> 20:36.201
No, it didn't work out fine, pal.
You walked all over her.

20:36.777 --> 20:39.747
Her heart's so big,
you wasted her time and our money.

20:39.905 --> 20:44.081
- To post bail for a bum like you?
- So you wanna talk about Tanya's heart?

20:44.243 --> 20:47.122
You dumb-ass ho,
you wanna talk about wasting time?

20:47.288 --> 20:49.256
- Yeah.
- Wasting money? Wasting her life?

20:49.415 --> 20:51.588
- You're a fucking money pit.
- I'm the money pit?

20:51.751 --> 20:53.469
You're the bottomless ho!

20:53.627 --> 20:55.174
Listen, guys! Guys!
- Oh, it's me?

20:55.337 --> 20:56.884
Don't put your hands on me, man!

20:57.047 --> 20:59.721
- No. Hey, listen up. Listen up!
- Well, I just did!

20:59.884 --> 21:04.310
All right? I have a fucking bail bondsman
sitting in the parking lot of the 7-Eleven...

21:04.472 --> 21:05.940
a half a mile from here.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.897
And if you don't give us these cows,
all I do is call him...

21:09.059 --> 21:11.278
and he's here in under a minute.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.735
What? You're gonna send
me back to jail, baby?

21:13.898 --> 21:17.243
That's right. I bailed you out when
nobody else would answer your phone.

21:17.401 --> 21:19.995
But if you fuck with me
I will fuck with you.

21:20.154 --> 21:24.000
Ha-ha-ha. Thing is, there ain't no
fucking 7-Eleven around here.

21:24.158 --> 21:27.503
- Give me this. Come on, girl.
- Well, then it's a mini-mart or something.

21:27.661 --> 21:30.164
But I... Okay.
It's ringing. It's ringing.

21:30.331 --> 21:32.425
- I'm taking the cow. Give me the cow.
- Hello.

21:32.583 --> 21:35.712
It's Tanya Skagle.
Hello. Yes, this is Tanya Skagle calling.

21:35.878 --> 21:38.802
Hey, give me the cow.
You know she's nutty enough to do it.

21:38.964 --> 21:41.012
Don't make me rat you out, Charlie.

21:41.175 --> 21:44.554
Remember what you said?
"A pimp always comes through for a pimp."

21:44.720 --> 21:46.939
I didn't say that. You said it.

21:47.097 --> 21:48.644
You agreed.

21:56.982 --> 21:58.450
All right.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.986
Just 10 cows.

22:03.405 --> 22:05.703
Don't take the one
with the yellow tag on its ear.

22:05.866 --> 22:07.618
That's Nacho.

22:08.702 --> 22:10.830
Little Charlie's favorite.

22:18.921 --> 22:22.471
All right, let's go. Come on.
We've got one more cow to go.

22:34.854 --> 22:36.356
How do they not fall over?

22:36.522 --> 22:39.901
They're cows, Tanya.
They've got a low center of gravity.

22:40.067 --> 22:43.446
God, I think I've got mud in my eye.

22:43.612 --> 22:46.240
- It might not be mud.
- What?

22:46.407 --> 22:48.409
Ray, God. What if it gets infected?

22:48.576 --> 22:51.295
Oh, it's ﬂoating around in there.

22:51.453 --> 22:53.706
Okay, hang on.

22:58.127 --> 23:00.129
- Just hold on.
- God, it's...

23:01.005 --> 23:02.598
- it's right in there.
- Come here.

23:02.756 --> 23:04.929
- Stuck in there.
- Come here. Don't touch it.

23:05.092 --> 23:08.062
- Can you see it?
- No.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.063
It's right there.

23:10.806 --> 23:13.275
- Do you...? Do you see it?
- Yeah.

23:14.435 --> 23:16.904
I don't like it when people
touch my eyeballs.

23:17.062 --> 23:19.360
I haven't done anything yet.

23:19.523 --> 23:21.241
Look that way.

23:22.526 --> 23:24.745
- Uh...
- There.

23:24.904 --> 23:27.748
- Wait, did you get it?
- Yeah.

23:27.907 --> 23:29.500
It was dirt.

23:36.832 --> 23:38.300
All right.

23:41.629 --> 23:44.473
Well.
We'll live to see another day.

23:44.632 --> 23:47.852
Yeah.
Orgasmic Living lives to see another day.

23:48.010 --> 23:49.011
Orgasmic Living.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.896
Women love it.

23:51.055 --> 23:54.184
- They love you, Ray.
- They love the whole thing, Tanya.

23:54.350 --> 23:58.025
You need a bath.
You've got a date in 12 hours.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.940
- We'd better hurry and find a butcher.
- What?

24:01.106 --> 24:03.279
Where do you think these cows
are going, Tanya?

24:03.442 --> 24:04.864
Fuck. Ray, what?
