Hey, guys, go on in.

00:27.748 --> 00:29.651
I'll be right there, thank you
for coming.

00:30.285 --> 00:32.851
We would like to
thank everyone for coming out

00:32.853 --> 00:36.692
to celebrate the life
of Brenda Amelia Arnaud.

00:38.026 --> 00:39.361
Brenda was well-loved.

00:42.396 --> 00:45.165
She spent her life as as
accountant and a dance instructor.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.132
Jim, we love
you; we're here for you.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.000
- Oh! Yeah, thanks.
- You're gonna get through it.

00:48.002 --> 00:49.836
She lived to the age
of 54.

00:49.838 --> 00:51.236
Thanks a lot. Oh, thank
you.

00:51.238 --> 00:54.239
She left us too soon.

00:54.241 --> 00:56.909
She was survived by three
children,

00:56.911 --> 00:58.246
Shane, Morgan, and James.

00:59.347 --> 01:00.913
James is with us here today,

01:00.915 --> 01:02.815
and he's like to say a few
words.

01:02.817 --> 01:04.887
James, would you please join us,
please?

01:08.222 --> 01:10.292
Oh yeah. Yeah, thanks.

01:10.792 --> 01:12.861
Sorry.

01:16.965 --> 01:18.964
Do you have everything you need?
You're prepared?

01:18.966 --> 01:20.769
Oh yeah, no, I'm fine. Thank you
so much.

01:22.504 --> 01:23.806
Hey, everybody.

01:24.206 --> 01:25.707
Thank you for coming.

01:27.775 --> 01:29.743
Brenda was a free spirit.

01:29.745 --> 01:32.781
She was a wonderful mother.

01:33.081 --> 01:34.716
She had three children.

01:35.250 --> 01:37.116
My brother and my sister
couldn't make it today

01:37.118 --> 01:39.188
but I've spoken to them on the
phone.

01:40.956 --> 01:42.224
She had 7 grandkids

01:44.159 --> 01:45.761
who loved her very much.

01:47.194 --> 01:49.397
She was a certified public
account,

01:50.465 --> 01:52.332
and she ran the dance academy

01:52.334 --> 01:54.203
here in town until about

01:54.736 --> 01:58.439
2009? Next to the old drug
store.

02:01.242 --> 02:03.077
My mother

02:04.146 --> 02:05.914
didn't believe in any of this!

02:07.248 --> 02:08.782
Not that that's a bad thing, she

02:09.518 --> 02:11.353
never judged anybody

02:11.686 --> 02:13.421
and, loved everybody, and

02:14.322 --> 02:15.524
cared for everybody, and

02:15.723 --> 02:17.556
never put herself first, it
seems like

02:17.558 --> 02:18.490
hearing some-

02:18.492 --> 02:20.425
sorry yeah, thank you so much
for comin

02:20.427 --> 02:22.828
Kevin, Matt, we got people here,
Judy

02:22.830 --> 02:24.899
Thank you, it means a lot, thank
you

02:27.169 --> 02:29.237
My mother was an extremely
charitable woman

02:30.472 --> 02:32.540
she donated to my school once
when I was a kid

02:33.341 --> 02:36.445
There was this girl in my grade
named Caitlin

02:37.412 --> 02:39.281
and she had Down's Syndrome

02:40.414 --> 02:41.449
or she had something

02:41.616 --> 02:43.448
she was

02:43.450 --> 02:45.018
she, no, she was a

02:45.020 --> 02:47.320
she was horrible-she was a
bitch, this girl

02:47.322 --> 02:49.088
and I know you're not supposed
to say that

02:49.090 --> 02:50.889
about a little girl, bless her
heart, but

02:50.891 --> 02:53.292
she used to bite kids a lot

02:53.294 --> 02:54.928
and she'd just come out at you

02:54.930 --> 02:57.432
and, I, the nightmares I used to
have

02:57.931 --> 03:00.101
She actually bit a teacher and

03:00.936 --> 03:02.337
Anyway

03:02.836 --> 03:05.437
My mom donated, like, a thousand
dollars

03:05.439 --> 03:06.538
to the school, because

03:06.540 --> 03:09.042
She wasn't allowed to play on
the play structures

03:09.044 --> 03:10.476
it was too dangerous

03:10.478 --> 03:13.145
but my Mom wanted her to -

03:13.147 --> 03:15.114
so they built her a little
playhouse and

03:15.116 --> 03:17.152
my Mom donated like a thousand
dollars and

03:17.318 --> 03:19.318
she didn't like the idea of her
being left out

03:19.320 --> 03:21.019
and she did it all anonymously!

03:21.021 --> 03:23.090
She didn't tell anybody about it
or anything

03:23.424 --> 03:25.157
and I don't have that in me.

03:25.159 --> 03:29.897
Whatever that is, but uh, it was
her, and-

03:38.639 --> 03:40.908
I opened the door for somebody
this morning and I

03:41.209 --> 03:43.277
got angry that they didn't say
thanks

03:46.213 --> 03:48.282
Sorry.

03:50.284 --> 03:53.388
I had some stuff, uh, I had some
stuff written down.

03:54.021 --> 03:56.090
<i>You're fine.</i>

03:59.394 --> 04:01.896
When you're a kid and you think
about stuff, you

04:02.163 --> 04:04.663
learn about America and the
founding-

04:04.665 --> 04:06.935
Thomas Jefferson and all that.

04:08.336 --> 04:10.405
But when you're a kid, you think
about it and say

04:10.737 --> 04:14.308
"Yeah, you know, these guys they
did all this."

04:16.043 --> 04:18.112
It doesn't mean anything to you.

04:18.413 --> 04:20.413
And then you grow up, and

04:20.415 --> 04:22.414
you realize, these guys were
incredible

04:22.416 --> 04:24.416
and they were just people

04:24.418 --> 04:27.486
like us, who lived, and loved-

04:27.488 --> 04:29.557
had a kid!

04:33.560 --> 04:35.560
And then you think about your
mom

04:35.562 --> 04:37.632
and your dad

04:38.165 --> 04:39.199
and the stories they used to
tell you

04:39.201 --> 04:42.671
when you were growing up, of
them, being young.

04:46.074 --> 04:48.143
And before I called her Mom she
was Brenda.

04:49.610 --> 04:51.680
Sorry.

04:52.012 --> 04:53.947
I don't know if I can keep
going.

04:53.949 --> 04:55.447
Keep going, you've got this.

04:55.449 --> 04:56.014
Yeah?

04:56.016 --> 04:57.649
You can do this, go on.

04:57.651 --> 04:59.452
That's cool.

04:59.454 --> 05:01.523
Yeah, no, I'm fine.

05:02.589 --> 05:04.659
She was just so wonderful and

05:05.492 --> 05:07.562
I gave her hell growing up

05:09.163 --> 05:11.163
we gave each other hell

05:11.165 --> 05:14.368
and... it gets to you when you
grow up

05:15.036 --> 05:17.305
and I'm one of the good guys
now!

05:20.408 --> 05:22.477
But I was just mean to her

05:24.512 --> 05:26.581
I'd lie to her

05:27.682 --> 05:29.951
I didn't mean to be

05:30.151 --> 05:32.219
John Wayne.

05:34.154 --> 05:35.454
I tell my daughter sometimes,

05:35.456 --> 05:37.526
"Hey, never say anything mean to
me."

05:38.392 --> 05:41.293
Not for my sake, obviously, you
know, I can take it

05:41.295 --> 05:43.365
I'm a grown man.

05:45.300 --> 05:49.170
But you would just hate for her
to have to look back and

05:51.639 --> 05:53.709
I was just stupid.

05:55.110 --> 05:57.179
I was just so stupid.

06:02.550 --> 06:04.619
I have, um-

06:08.189 --> 06:10.258
I am a dyslexic.

06:10.790 --> 06:13.060
I never even think about it
really,

06:14.327 --> 06:17.163
when I was in high school I had to
listen to all of these books on tape

06:17.165 --> 06:19.164
it looks like the words are all
jumbled up when you're reading

06:19.166 --> 06:21.235
I can do it, I'm just not that
fast

06:22.504 --> 06:24.573
but when I went to school at LSU

06:25.372 --> 06:27.442
Go Tigers.

06:28.875 --> 06:32.478
We found out they weren't gonna have
anything like that for my textbooks

06:32.480 --> 06:34.549
and so my Mom bought a little
tape recorder-

06:36.117 --> 06:38.186
and so she

06:39.120 --> 06:43.458
and so she'd read all the things that I
had to read so I could do well in school

06:44.459 --> 06:46.528
that's all she wanted.

06:47.295 --> 06:49.364
Screwed that up.

06:50.163 --> 06:53.168
And I'd say "hey thanks Mom, for
doing that"

06:53.600 --> 06:56.571
"that means a lot, sending it to
me in the mail", but

06:58.238 --> 07:00.307
she must have been up so late

07:00.975 --> 07:03.245
and it gets to you when you grow
up

07:04.678 --> 07:06.747
it eats you alive.

07:10.819 --> 07:12.819
I'm so sorry, I'm so

07:12.821 --> 07:16.221
I had it planned, I wasn't-I

07:16.223 --> 07:18.259
Go ahead, you're fine.

07:19.326 --> 07:21.396
Anywho!

07:22.596 --> 07:25.533
My mom was a big fan of Bruce
Springsteen

07:26.634 --> 07:28.703
she loved Bruce Springsteen

07:29.069 --> 07:33.438
and "Bruce Springsteen" meant leaving your small
town and going to do something with your life

07:33.440 --> 07:35.440
and she said that she wouldn't
have left

07:35.442 --> 07:37.676
if she hand't heard him-she
loved him so much.

07:37.678 --> 07:39.747
I'm so sorry.

07:42.182 --> 07:44.752
She used to sing Thunder Road
to me when I was going to sleep

07:46.620 --> 07:50.188
and I'm not a singer, or a
dancer-

07:50.190 --> 07:53.493
or you know, anything my daughter
is the creative one, but

07:53.495 --> 07:57.132
people said it'd be a good idea
if I brought it in, so

07:58.665 --> 08:01.269
so I brought it in and, uh

08:03.771 --> 08:05.841
Yeah, so I'm gonna sing it.

08:08.209 --> 08:10.278
Okay...

08:17.519 --> 08:19.588
I had it working this morning, I
promise.

08:20.922 --> 08:23.191
Come on just fucking work.

08:24.791 --> 08:26.861
Come on, please, just-sorry.

08:35.370 --> 08:36.568
It's not gonna work, uh

08:36.571 --> 08:38.436
yeah! Could you do that? That'd
be great

08:38.438 --> 08:40.509
It's, uh, it's just Track 4
thank you so much.

08:41.475 --> 08:45.413
Uh, it's a beautiful song,
How do you explain it?

08:46.279 --> 08:50.782
It's a song this guy, telling this
girl to leave their small town forever

08:50.784 --> 08:51.883
to change their lives-

08:51.885 --> 08:53.886
Should we just call the
manufacturer?

08:53.888 --> 08:56.555
Change their lives forever for
the better

08:56.557 --> 08:58.557
and my Mom really loved it-

08:58.559 --> 09:00.560
It's not gonna work? No, he's
saying it's not gonna work.

09:00.562 --> 09:02.630
I'm sorry, uh well

09:03.565 --> 09:05.634
Typical! I uh-

09:05.899 --> 09:08.401
I don't even know if it's gonna work
without the song to be honest with you

09:08.403 --> 09:10.969
but I did a lot of planning
for it and I love my Mom

09:10.971 --> 09:15.177
and so I'm just gonna do it, and I
don't know what else to do, so-

09:28.690 --> 09:30.759
It starts out and there's a
harmonica

09:32.460 --> 09:34.528
and this girl walks out on her
porch

09:34.861 --> 09:36.932
and she's listening to Roy
Orbison

09:37.764 --> 09:39.765
and back in the day

09:39.767 --> 09:42.734
Roy Orbison used to sing songs
for sad and lonely people

09:42.736 --> 09:44.805
so they wouldn't be sad and
lonely anymore.

09:46.307 --> 09:49.344
It's a beautiful song.
You can find it.

09:50.477 --> 09:52.677
Actually they whole thing is on
YouTube I have it on my phone

09:52.679 --> 09:54.799
I could have just done that now
that I think about it.

09:56.918 --> 09:58.917
I'm just gonna do it.

09:58.919 --> 10:00.754
Uh, I'm gonna be sick.

10:00.955 --> 10:03.225
Sorry.

10:15.802 --> 10:17.871
Crystal, go sit back down with
Mommy.

10:18.605 --> 10:20.875
Crystal, please go sit back down
with Mommy, honey.

10:21.140 --> 10:23.410
Crystal, go sit, uh

10:23.610 --> 10:25.513

10:28.515 --> 10:31.785
It's ok, honey, it's alright
Daddy is just dancing.

10:32.687 --> 10:34.686
Daddy's just dancing

10:34.688 --> 10:36.656
Oh, Mona, I didn't mean to make
you cry!

10:36.658 --> 10:38.726
I'm sorry!

10:39.461 --> 10:43.298
Your mascara is all over the-
You look awful.

10:43.597 --> 10:45.699
Do you want to take some time
outside?

10:45.966 --> 10:47.532
Do I have to leave?

10:47.534 --> 10:49.535
No, no, do you want to take your
seat?

10:49.537 --> 10:52.738
Oh, yeah, yeah, I can got sit,

Yeah, that's fine-Actually, uh

10:55.308 --> 10:57.542

just say "goodbye" real quick?

10:57.544 --> 10:59.613
Of course, of course!

11:06.019 --> 11:08.289
Fuck, what do you do? Uh...

11:12.025 --> 11:14.295
Goodbye, Mom.

11:17.065 --> 11:19.065

It's ok honey. Oh, Jesus
fucking Christ you're heavy.

11:33.847 --> 11:35.916
I would hope that everyone
please remember

11:38.485 --> 11:40.554
That everyone grieves
differently

11:41.054 --> 11:43.324
and everyone - is unique.

11:44.125 --> 11:47.761
There's no right way, and
there's no wrong way.

Oh, thank you, thats,

13:46.847 --> 13:49.248
You must have had to say that a
couple times today, huh?

13:49.250 --> 13:51.083
What's that?

13:51.085 --> 13:54.689
Oh, yeah.

No no, it's totally fine, I'm
actually kind of glad you didn't.

14:02.897 --> 14:06.701
Oh yeah?
Did everything go ok?

14:06.900 --> 14:08.969
Everything went normal.

14:12.706 --> 14:14.775
Great!

14:15.009 --> 14:17.877
So, do you want to get going?

This fucking guy, huh?

14:40.268 --> 14:42.968
What's goin' on here today,
sir?

14:42.970 --> 14:45.070
They don't know!

14:45.072 --> 14:46.671
Sir, would you stop
thrashing around please?

14:46.673 --> 14:47.573
They don't know.

14:47.575 --> 14:49.074
Who doesn't know, sir?

14:49.076 --> 14:51.276
They don't know.

14:51.278 --> 14:53.244
Sir, I've gotten a few phone
calls from local businesses

14:53.246 --> 14:55.247
that somebody's in their
parking lot thrashing around,

14:55.249 --> 14:57.550
saying nasty things about
a certain female politician

14:57.552 --> 14:58.383
taking their clothes off.

14:58.385 --> 14:59.218
Do you know anything about that,
sir?

14:59.220 --> 15:00.986
They don't
know!

15:00.988 --> 15:02.854
You got a name, hombre?

15:02.856 --> 15:04.022
Any ID?

15:04.024 --> 15:04.956
Copy that.

15:04.958 --> 15:06.858
Idiot!

15:06.860 --> 15:08.227
Well, now, that's not very
nice.

15:08.229 --> 15:09.295
- You're gonna hurt my feelings.
- Hey, listen,

15:09.297 --> 15:10.296
We're still getting complaints.

15:10.298 --> 15:12.263
Let's, uh, let's just
sit him down over there

15:12.265 --> 15:14.199
on the sidewalk and let him
cool off a little bit, huh?

15:14.201 --> 15:15.065
- How 'bout I give you
- HOMELESS MAN: Huh! Huh!

15:15.067 --> 15:16.427
One last chance to play nice
there?

15:18.773 --> 15:20.071
Don't start spittin', sir.

15:20.073 --> 15:21.306
That's a bad habit.

15:21.308 --> 15:23.709
Huh, huh, huh!

15:23.711 --> 15:24.709
- Call the boss.
- Right!

15:24.711 --> 15:25.844
Maybe Richie's got the keys

15:25.846 --> 15:26.578
- to the one that's big enough.
- Hey!

15:26.580 --> 15:28.012
Oh!

15:28.014 --> 15:29.815
The fuck is your problem,
asshole?

15:29.817 --> 15:30.682
They don't
know!

15:30.684 --> 15:31.517
Jim, Jim.

15:31.519 --> 15:32.450
They don't
know!

15:32.452 --> 15:34.219
Jim!

15:34.221 --> 15:35.688
- Jim! Jim! Jim!
- They don't know!

15:36.990 --> 15:38.891
They don't
know!

15:38.893 --> 15:40.291
You assaulted a
police officer, asshole,

15:40.293 --> 15:41.627
and we don't take kindly to that
shit, generally!

15:41.629 --> 15:43.094
- Hey, hey, hey.
- They don't know.

15:43.096 --> 15:43.896
Hey, hey, hey.

15:43.898 --> 15:45.598
- Jim!
- They don't know!

15:45.600 --> 15:46.632
- Go wait in the car!
- What's wrong with you?

15:46.634 --> 15:47.333
Go wait in the car, please!

15:47.335 --> 15:48.032
What is wrong with you?

15:48.034 --> 15:48.867
Please, Go wait in the car.

15:48.869 --> 15:49.501
I don't know what's wrong with
me!

15:49.503 --> 15:50.169
Please go wait in the car.

15:50.171 --> 15:52.604
Hey, Captain, hey, Captain.

15:52.606 --> 15:53.439
No, everything's fine.

15:53.441 --> 15:55.074
- Hey, Captain, hey, Captain...
- Jim!

15:55.076 --> 15:56.675
Jim, what're you doing here
today?

15:56.677 --> 15:58.243
It's a simple drunk and
disorderly, sir.

15:58.245 --> 15:59.777
Nate and I got it covered.

15:59.779 --> 16:00.778
We're bookin' him, end of story.

16:00.780 --> 16:02.781
Do you remember the
meeting we had last week

16:02.783 --> 16:03.647
where we discussed and we agreed

16:03.649 --> 16:04.983
that you would not be here this
week?

16:04.985 --> 16:06.919
You were to take this week off.

16:06.921 --> 16:08.621
No, sir, I'm a field officer.

16:08.623 --> 16:09.320
So I'm out here in the field.

16:09.322 --> 16:10.122
Been doing it for six years.

16:10.124 --> 16:10.921
I thought you'd know that by
now.

16:10.923 --> 16:11.989
You don't remember that
meeting

16:11.991 --> 16:15.026
where you called me a
name, you spilled coffee?

16:15.028 --> 16:17.863
And you were not gonna be here
this week.

16:17.865 --> 16:18.729
'Fraid I don't.

16:18.731 --> 16:19.998
Come on, man, please don't do
this.

16:20.000 --> 16:21.967
Let me tell ya what's gonna
happen in the next 10 seconds.

16:21.969 --> 16:23.801
You're gonna get in
that cruiser over there,

16:23.803 --> 16:25.871
and Officer Louis is gonna take
you home.

16:25.873 --> 16:27.739
What part of that did you not
understand?

16:29.710 --> 16:30.711
I got it.

16:32.078 --> 16:33.244
Glad to hear it.

16:33.246 --> 16:34.979
Thank you so much, sir!

16:34.981 --> 16:37.116
I'll take all that into
consideration.

16:37.118 --> 16:39.084
And thank you for coming
down here today, sir.

16:39.086 --> 16:40.819
That means a lot, you
didn't have to do that,

16:40.821 --> 16:42.253
but that's top down leadership.

16:42.255 --> 16:43.388
Everything you were talkin'
about

16:43.390 --> 16:45.156
in your PowerPoint presentation,

16:45.158 --> 16:48.727
synergy, teamwork, all that, I
heard it.

16:48.729 --> 16:50.963
And thank you so much,
Richie, for handling all this.

16:50.965 --> 16:52.397
That mean's a lot.

16:52.399 --> 16:53.265
Don't worry about that bullshit.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.233
I'm gonna see you guys on the
sixth.

16:54.235 --> 16:57.869
Ninth! You
will return for duty

16:57.871 --> 16:59.838
- on Monday the ninth.
- The ninth, the ninth.

16:59.840 --> 17:01.942
Monday's the ninth, guys.

17:11.152 --> 17:12.152
OK.

17:14.855 --> 17:16.188
Feel like driving me home?

17:16.190 --> 17:17.823
Yeah.

17:17.825 --> 17:19.724
Is everything OK?

17:19.727 --> 17:22.060
With me? I'm fine.

17:22.063 --> 17:24.228
I never been better in my life.

17:24.230 --> 17:26.150
See me wrestling an
aligator, help the alligator.

17:27.835 --> 17:29.834
Yeah, you like that one?

17:29.836 --> 17:32.103
It's an old one of my dad's,
apparently.

17:32.105 --> 17:32.970
He used to say that all the time

17:32.972 --> 17:35.140
whenever anything was goin' just
great.

17:35.142 --> 17:37.077
You know, it's my mom,

17:38.846 --> 17:40.746
but I'm fine,

17:40.748 --> 17:43.047
and, uh, I'm glad he did
that, pull me off duty

17:43.049 --> 17:44.149
in front of everybody like that.

17:44.151 --> 17:45.383
- That was a smart move.
- Yeah?

17:45.385 --> 17:47.419
- Yeah, he's a smart guy.
- He is smart.

17:47.421 --> 17:50.322
Yeah, deeply appreciate it,
you know?

17:50.324 --> 17:52.056
Why don't you actually come
to dinner and meet, please...

17:52.058 --> 17:54.159
No, I'm fine, honestly.

17:54.161 --> 17:56.161
I got family over at my
place right now cookin' up,

17:56.163 --> 17:57.763
and I shouldn't keep 'em.

17:57.765 --> 17:59.898
And I got Crystal on Monday, so
I'm...

17:59.900 --> 18:03.736
Actually, would you, uh, would
you mind,

18:03.738 --> 18:06.337
would you drop me off at
an Office Depot real quick?

18:17.484 --> 18:18.851
Hello.

18:18.853 --> 18:20.119
Hi, how y'all doin'?

18:20.121 --> 18:22.153
Doin' fine. Anything
I can help you with?

18:22.155 --> 18:25.990
Yeah, I need to buy a scanner
I think.

18:25.992 --> 18:27.159
But it's gotta be
something that'll hook up

18:27.161 --> 18:28.994
to my laptop from work.

18:28.996 --> 18:31.430
Is that even something
you guys would have?

18:36.936 --> 18:38.003
So down the middle,

18:38.005 --> 18:40.072
they're saying it's gonna
be 1248 and 70 cents.

18:40.074 --> 18:42.775
Is that something y'all
can handle right now?

18:45.011 --> 18:46.010
What do you think about Shane?

18:46.012 --> 18:48.814
Do you think he's in a
place to take that on?

18:48.816 --> 18:49.882
There is nothing, really.

18:49.884 --> 18:53.117
What do they say? A third
of zero is still zero?

18:53.119 --> 18:56.121
No, Morgan, I'm not gonna
sell the dance academy.

18:56.123 --> 18:57.322
That thing's a money maker.

18:57.324 --> 19:00.025
I'm gonna go in there myself
and clean it up, you'll see.

19:00.027 --> 19:01.258
And split that income three
ways.

19:01.260 --> 19:03.996
I don't care if all of your
children want saxophone lessons.

19:03.998 --> 19:06.467
That is never going to happen.

19:10.069 --> 19:12.136
It was fine, it was intense.

19:12.138 --> 19:14.206
I wasn't expecting that.

19:14.208 --> 19:15.908
I'm glad I was there, though.

19:15.910 --> 19:16.574
Not like that.

19:16.576 --> 19:18.075
No, stop!

19:18.077 --> 19:19.411
I didn't mean it like that.

19:19.413 --> 19:22.113
I meant that I'm glad
that I was there for her

19:22.115 --> 19:26.520
because I didn't have a
whole lot of that growing up.

20:15.536 --> 20:17.969
Oh!

20:17.971 --> 20:19.304
- Wait a minute!
- Stand up.

20:19.306 --> 20:20.138
Hold on a sec!

20:20.140 --> 20:20.805
I know this boy's
mother!

20:20.807 --> 20:21.506
Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.

20:21.508 --> 20:23.475
Now what did you do?

20:23.477 --> 20:25.076
You are as dumb as they say you
are!

20:25.078 --> 20:26.879
- I'm gonna call your mother!
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am!

20:26.881 --> 20:28.046
- Ma'am, stop!
- And I'm gonna tell her!

20:28.048 --> 20:30.315
Ma'am!

20:30.317 --> 20:31.315
Stay right here.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.352
I'm gonna come back and
ask you some questions.

20:33.354 --> 20:36.188
Uhhh, I do have traffic
tickets, sir.

20:36.190 --> 20:37.623
That's fine.

20:40.027 --> 20:44.432
Ain't this some
bullshit!

21:23.369 --> 21:25.103
Shit.

21:25.105 --> 21:26.371
Mind rolling down the window?

21:26.373 --> 21:27.439
Sorry, Officer.

21:27.441 --> 21:28.305
I'm not talkin' to
you, I'm talkin' to her.

21:28.307 --> 21:31.109
Why don't you to roll down the
window.

21:31.111 --> 21:33.581
Evening, officer, what's up?

21:35.348 --> 21:38.449
Everything all right,
ma'am?

21:38.451 --> 21:39.452
I'm fine.

21:43.356 --> 21:45.123
Why don't you step out
of the car for a second.

21:45.125 --> 21:48.459
Come talk to me. It looks
a little steamy in here.

21:49.730 --> 21:51.462
What're you doin'?

21:51.464 --> 21:53.664
Don't smoke that in front
of a cop, it's trashy.

21:53.666 --> 21:54.798
You seem like a smart girl.

21:54.800 --> 21:57.469
What're you doin' hangin'
out with these two clowns?

21:57.471 --> 22:00.171
Nothin' better to do out here.

22:00.173 --> 22:01.239
You're telling me
there's nothin' better to do

22:01.241 --> 22:03.240
in this town than make out
with these two slickers

22:03.242 --> 22:07.312
in a parking lot outside of the
Dillard's?

22:07.314 --> 22:08.314
Yeah.

22:09.048 --> 22:13.285
All right, well, that
hasn't been my experience.

22:13.287 --> 22:15.720
How 'bout I give you a ride
home.

22:15.722 --> 22:18.090
No, sir, my mom
would kill me

22:18.092 --> 22:20.225
if she saw me get
dropped off in a cop car.

22:20.227 --> 22:21.325
All right, well,

22:21.327 --> 22:22.594
I don't have to fuckin'
drop you off right outside.

22:22.596 --> 22:24.595
I can drop you off around the
corner or something like that.

22:24.597 --> 22:26.198
I'm not leavin' a
16-year-old in a parking lot

22:26.200 --> 22:27.431
with two slickers.

22:27.433 --> 22:32.237
How 'bout you go collect your
things, I'll drive you home.

22:37.510 --> 22:40.011
Hey, is everything
all right, officer?

22:40.013 --> 22:42.413
Keep it up,
buddy, see what happens.

22:42.415 --> 22:44.382
What school you go to?

22:44.384 --> 22:45.517
Stoneybrook.

22:45.519 --> 22:47.486
Stoneybrook, huh?

22:47.488 --> 22:50.354
Yeah, since kindergarten.

22:50.356 --> 22:51.424
Go Wildcats.

22:53.126 --> 22:55.360
What's your family do?

22:55.362 --> 22:57.496
My dad's a contractor.

22:57.498 --> 23:01.102
He's always out doing something
or other.

23:01.801 --> 23:05.136
You try to stay out of
trouble?

23:05.138 --> 23:07.238
I mean, I try.

23:07.240 --> 23:10.443
but trouble always ends up
finding me,

23:23.757 --> 23:25.426
Take care.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.460
Hey, you don't have to
walk on the sidewalk

23:29.462 --> 23:31.296
if you ever feel unsafe.

23:31.298 --> 23:34.799
You can just walk in the middle
of the street, that's fine.

23:46.380 --> 23:48.580
No, get in front.

23:48.582 --> 23:52.450
That looks pretty, you
gotta frame your face.

23:52.452 --> 23:54.186
Did you get enough to eat?

23:54.188 --> 23:55.453
Yeah.

23:55.455 --> 23:57.354
Hey, sweetie.

23:57.356 --> 23:59.458
Hey, you're early.

23:59.460 --> 24:01.793
All right, well, it's
better than being late.

24:01.795 --> 24:04.830
Yeah, that was really
something to see the other day.

24:04.832 --> 24:06.133
Yeah, well,

24:06.767 --> 24:07.865
I lost my mom,

24:07.867 --> 24:10.334
and she woulda loved it, so.

24:10.336 --> 24:12.770
It was just, never
seen anything like that.

24:12.772 --> 24:13.971
All the people

24:13.973 --> 24:15.574
I've been speaking to say
that's pretty normal, actually.

24:15.576 --> 24:16.674
When you talk about losing
somebody.

24:16.676 --> 24:17.741
Really? What people
you been speaking to?

24:17.743 --> 24:18.876
You can move that.

24:18.878 --> 24:19.878
People.

24:19.880 --> 24:21.746
Yeah, I heard that part of it.

24:21.748 --> 24:22.817
What people?

24:23.650 --> 24:25.316
I don't know, people.

24:25.318 --> 24:26.584
What do you want? Leave me
alone.

24:26.586 --> 24:28.553
- If I'm hearing you right...
- Seatbelt on.

24:28.555 --> 24:29.621
I'm glad you finally
got some professional help

24:29.623 --> 24:31.555
for yourself because I've
told you that before.

24:31.557 --> 24:32.556
OK, that's great, Roz.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.525
OK, well, I'm taking her now.

24:33.527 --> 24:36.361
Hey, Crystal, make
sure he feeds you, baby.

24:36.363 --> 24:37.863
Honey, tell your mommy to feed
herself.

24:37.865 --> 24:39.500
Mommy.

24:44.872 --> 24:46.604
Goodbye, honey, what's up?

24:46.606 --> 24:48.440
When? When will I see you
again?

24:48.442 --> 24:49.540
Thursday, it's nothing.

24:49.542 --> 24:51.276
It's gonna fly right by.

24:51.278 --> 24:52.143
I love you.

24:52.145 --> 24:53.344
I love you, too!

24:53.346 --> 24:55.346
Hey, let's say our prayers
today, Tuesday, and Wednesday...

24:55.348 --> 24:56.280
Yeah, OK, thanks, Roz!

24:56.282 --> 24:57.815
Yeah, goodbye, Jim.

24:57.817 --> 24:58.883
Love you.

24:58.885 --> 25:00.584
Hey, Roz, actually, real
quick, while I got you.

25:00.586 --> 25:01.286
They're doing some construction

25:01.288 --> 25:03.188
on the railroad tracks up there.

25:03.190 --> 25:05.157
They got some cars and some
flares set up,

25:05.159 --> 25:06.458
but the signs aren't that big.

25:06.460 --> 25:07.691
Keep an eye out, all right?

25:07.693 --> 25:09.861
I'd hate to see you and Chris
get hit by a fuckin' train.

25:09.863 --> 25:11.662
Yeah, thanks a lot, Jim.

25:11.664 --> 25:13.230
Just lookin' out.

25:13.232 --> 25:15.767
Yeah, I really appreciate
that.

25:21.441 --> 25:22.540
Are we going?

25:22.542 --> 25:23.775
Yeah, we're going.

25:24.644 --> 25:26.779
Hey, honey! How ya doin'?

25:28.382 --> 25:31.449
So when did she shut this
place down?

25:31.451 --> 25:35.187
2009, honey, that's
why we gotta clean it up.

25:36.722 --> 25:38.657
How many student were there?

25:38.659 --> 25:40.691
At one point, there were over
a hundred.

25:40.693 --> 25:42.826
Grandma has awards from
all over the state.

25:42.828 --> 25:45.363
Wish I could find those...

25:45.365 --> 25:46.634
She was sick?

25:47.834 --> 25:49.567
Yeah.

26:02.382 --> 26:03.382
Ta-da!

26:05.952 --> 26:07.651
What do you think?

26:07.653 --> 26:09.587
If you hate it, we can take it
back.

26:09.589 --> 26:10.657
It's nice.

26:11.657 --> 26:13.326
I like my old bed.

26:15.895 --> 26:16.963
All right.

26:17.931 --> 26:20.431
I still have it leaning up
against the back of the house.

26:20.433 --> 26:23.535
I could bring it back up here if
you like.

26:23.537 --> 26:26.504
No, it's fine.

26:26.506 --> 26:27.771
Oh, honey, you don't
have to do that right now.

26:27.773 --> 26:28.840
I was hoping we could go
downstairs,

26:28.842 --> 26:31.742
order a pizza, and watch
The Fast and the Furious.

26:31.744 --> 26:33.644
OK, if that's what you wanna
do.

26:34.981 --> 26:37.949
Well, what do you wanna do?

26:46.026 --> 26:49.563
Did I get invited to Arial's
birthday?

26:50.564 --> 26:51.564
Um...

26:52.398 --> 26:53.931
Which one's Ariel?

26:53.933 --> 26:55.432
When was it?

26:55.434 --> 26:57.936
From camp.

26:57.938 --> 26:59.504
It was last week.

26:59.506 --> 27:01.538
She asked why I didn't make it.

27:01.540 --> 27:02.540
Uhhh...

27:04.411 --> 27:08.282
Uhhh, yeah, lemme, ah,
sorry, honey, hold on.

27:12.419 --> 27:17.488
Which one is she?

27:17.490 --> 27:19.359
Yeah, honey, you did.

27:21.428 --> 27:23.795
Oh, no, it was Friday; your mom
had you.

27:23.797 --> 27:27.298
I know, she asked why you
didn't remind her about it.

27:27.300 --> 27:29.901
Oh, well, yeah.

27:29.903 --> 27:31.303
I thought you were so excited
about it.

27:31.305 --> 27:33.705
I thought you woulda told her.

27:33.707 --> 27:36.007
And I didn't
get her a present.

27:36.009 --> 27:37.308
Oh, that's fine.

27:37.310 --> 27:38.742
We can still get her something,
honey.

27:38.744 --> 27:40.511
We don't have to...
Don't worry about that.

27:40.513 --> 27:41.746
We'll find her something.

27:41.748 --> 27:45.816
Tell her Daddy messed up and
that we'll get her something.

27:45.818 --> 27:48.355
No, that's fine.

27:51.458 --> 27:52.657
Hey, I was thinkin'
maybe we could go down

27:52.659 --> 27:54.758
to the ice cream stand in a
bit and get some ice cream.

27:54.760 --> 27:56.628
How's that sound?

27:56.630 --> 27:58.796
I could eat ice
cream.

27:58.798 --> 28:00.401
Could you? Huh.

28:01.134 --> 28:02.467
I didn't know you liked ice
cream.

28:02.469 --> 28:03.301
That's super interesting.

28:03.303 --> 28:05.804
I'm gonna have to write that
down.

28:05.806 --> 28:09.039
You know how
to play the hands up game?

28:09.041 --> 28:10.040
What's that?

28:10.042 --> 28:11.476
The hand up game.

28:11.478 --> 28:13.614
Caroline taught me. Here.

28:22.122 --> 28:23.488
Oh, yeah, girls used
to do this at school.

28:23.490 --> 28:24.355
I know this game.

28:24.357 --> 28:25.759
How do you do it?

28:27.728 --> 28:30.596
Pop right, pop left, pop
front.

28:31.832 --> 28:33.998
- OK.
- That's it,

28:34.000 --> 28:36.901
and two for two, three
for three, four for four.

28:36.903 --> 28:39.703
And after four you slap down,
got it?

28:39.705 --> 28:41.040
OK, let's do it.

28:43.910 --> 28:46.710
Honey, I, honey, I can't
do it that fast, sorry.

28:46.712 --> 28:47.511
Let's do it again.

28:47.513 --> 28:48.979
No, it's fine, just keep
going.

28:48.981 --> 28:50.614
OK.

28:50.616 --> 28:52.484
I'm sorry, honey, do we
have to go that fast?

28:52.486 --> 28:54.021
That wasn't fast.

28:55.154 --> 28:56.623
Oh, OK, cool.

28:58.791 --> 29:00.658
Honey, honey, I'm
really not gonna be good

29:00.660 --> 29:02.596
at this kind of stuff.

29:05.531 --> 29:06.899
Yeah.

29:17.443 --> 29:19.576
How 'bout we go get
some of that ice cream?

29:19.578 --> 29:22.582
I'm going to stay
here.

29:25.885 --> 29:27.684
This door open enough,
honey?

29:27.686 --> 29:28.552
Yep.

29:28.554 --> 29:29.120
You want me to leave the
light on

29:29.122 --> 29:31.756
in the hallway for you?

29:31.758 --> 29:33.658
It's fine.

29:33.660 --> 29:36.527
All right, I goin' to bed,
honey.

29:36.529 --> 29:38.531
Good night, I love you.

30:02.923 --> 30:04.655
An estimated
1.3 million of the vehicles

30:04.657 --> 30:07.991
model years 2011 to 2017 could
be...

30:09.028 --> 30:09.893
Still
can't find solid evidence

30:09.895 --> 30:10.894
the injuries were accidents but
caused

30:10.896 --> 30:15.836
by carbon monoxide leaks
which doesn't sit well...

30:26.980 --> 30:28.712
Honey, you're not
nervous about going to school,

30:28.714 --> 30:29.646
are ya?

30:29.648 --> 30:30.849
No.

30:30.851 --> 30:32.584
Good. Caroline's in your
class.

30:32.586 --> 30:34.486
It's gonna be just like
goin' to Camp Catalaya,

30:34.488 --> 30:36.854
or like a summer party
at your mom's place.

30:36.856 --> 30:37.855
You're gonna do just fine,
honey.

30:37.857 --> 30:39.757
I think you're really
gonna like fourth grade.

30:39.759 --> 30:43.126
Yeah, I keep hearing
that.

30:43.128 --> 30:46.597
Hey, Dad, can I talk to you for
a second?

30:46.599 --> 30:47.565
What's up?

30:47.567 --> 30:49.968
Can I talk
to you for a second?

30:49.970 --> 30:50.970
Yeah.

30:53.606 --> 30:55.507
What's goin' on, honey?

30:55.509 --> 30:57.176
Everything all right?

31:33.680 --> 31:34.680
OK, OK.

31:39.586 --> 31:40.951
So how 'bout we get your
backpack on,

31:40.953 --> 31:44.622
and I'll take you to school,
sound good?

31:44.624 --> 31:46.024
Yeah, all right.

31:46.026 --> 31:48.629
(phone rings

31:59.071 --> 32:00.806
Hey, you got Jim.

32:05.979 --> 32:08.345
All right, big miss fourth
grade!

32:08.347 --> 32:11.151
Make way! This is gonna be the...

32:15.188 --> 32:17.020
Honey, are you wearing makeup?

32:17.022 --> 32:18.291
No.

32:19.192 --> 32:21.726
Crystal, look at me.

32:21.728 --> 32:23.330
Crystal, look at me.

32:24.698 --> 32:26.597
Honey, why are you wearing
makeup?

32:26.599 --> 32:27.931
Stop! I'm gonna be late!

32:27.933 --> 32:28.900
It's fine!

32:28.902 --> 32:30.000
No, you're in fourth
grade, honey.

32:30.002 --> 32:30.901
They're gonna send you home.

32:30.903 --> 32:32.003
Why're you wearin' all that?

32:32.005 --> 32:32.670
It's fine!

32:32.672 --> 32:33.837
Plenty of girls wear makeup!

32:33.839 --> 32:38.809
It's not a big deal!

32:38.811 --> 32:42.080
I just thought that if I'm
starting in a new class,

32:42.082 --> 32:44.215
I should at least be
one of the pretty girls.

32:45.785 --> 32:48.753
What are you talkin'
about, honey?

32:48.755 --> 32:50.220
You're one of the most beautiful
girls

32:50.222 --> 32:51.221
in your grade last year.

32:51.223 --> 32:52.757
That picture of you at the lake?

32:52.759 --> 32:55.159
No, I have your jaw
and I have your eyebrows!

32:55.161 --> 32:56.995
I look like a boy.

32:56.997 --> 33:01.766
Well, you look like a model,
is what you look like, honey.

33:01.768 --> 33:02.767
You don't get to pick that
stuff.

33:02.769 --> 33:04.401
You get what you get,
and you don't get upset.

33:04.403 --> 33:05.937
You don't see me complaining.

33:05.939 --> 33:10.173
I don't have a big job or
anything, and I make do.

33:10.175 --> 33:12.075
You're gonna be fine, and you're
fine now.

33:12.077 --> 33:14.211
Who's tellin' you you're not
pretty?

33:14.213 --> 33:15.646
I don't know.

33:22.955 --> 33:27.257
Look, I'm happy to
take you somewhere and

33:27.259 --> 33:29.259
look into gettin' you a new
dress or something like that,

33:29.261 --> 33:31.328
but I can't drop you off
at school like that, honey.

33:31.330 --> 33:34.800
You look like a... Hold on, look
at me.

33:37.237 --> 33:40.705
Crystal, look at me.

33:40.707 --> 33:44.107
Good lord.

33:44.109 --> 33:45.276
You're gonna be fine today,
honey.

33:45.278 --> 33:45.977
I'm gonna take you to the park,

33:45.979 --> 33:46.611
and we're gonna wash that off.

33:46.613 --> 33:47.844
You have a beautiful face.

33:47.846 --> 33:51.181
Don't go ruin it with some shit
your mom got you at Target.

33:51.183 --> 33:53.316
I hope I get Mom's boobs.

33:53.318 --> 33:54.751
What did you say?

33:54.753 --> 33:57.455
I said, I hope I get Mom's
boobs!

33:57.457 --> 34:02.360
Oh, my god.

34:02.362 --> 34:05.098
I hope everyday that you don't.

34:09.335 --> 34:11.001
Hey, honey, don't jump
out of a moving car!

34:11.003 --> 34:12.003
Hey! I love you!

34:12.005 --> 34:14.137
Pay attention! Pay
attention! Pay attention!

34:14.139 --> 34:15.972
Call me if you need anything!

34:17.143 --> 34:18.143
Hey.

34:49.141 --> 34:50.806
Hi
there, are you Jimmy Arnaud?

34:50.809 --> 34:51.675
I am.

34:51.677 --> 34:53.010
Hi, I represent a local law
firm.

34:53.012 --> 34:54.978
I'm here to serve you those
papers.

34:54.981 --> 34:55.978
You're from a law firm?

34:55.981 --> 34:57.280
Am I gettin' sued? What
am I getting sued for?

34:57.282 --> 35:00.886
Not my
concern.

35:01.820 --> 35:03.789
Well, you're no help!

35:06.259 --> 35:07.458
Hello?

35:07.460 --> 35:09.260
Hey Roz, I just had a guy
in a nice suit on a bicycle

35:09.262 --> 35:10.762
drop off some paperwork for me.

35:10.764 --> 35:12.063
What is this I'm lookin' at
here?

35:12.065 --> 35:14.965
It's divorce paperwork,
Sherlock.

35:14.967 --> 35:16.200
I think you knew this was
coming.

35:16.202 --> 35:17.133
Yeah, no, I knew this was
coming.

35:17.135 --> 35:18.503
Who'd you talk to about doin'
all this?

35:18.505 --> 35:19.436
What do you care?

35:19.438 --> 35:21.472
I filed, you don't have to do
anything.

35:21.474 --> 35:22.338
Fuck you, I don't have to do
anything.

35:22.340 --> 35:23.907
This says you're asking for sole
custody.

35:23.909 --> 35:24.775
You read it?

35:24.777 --> 35:25.744
He read it.

35:25.746 --> 35:27.445
Well, Jim, she hates being at
your place,

35:27.447 --> 35:29.546
and I'm not paying for her to
come to Tuscaloosa every week.

35:29.548 --> 35:31.249
It's not like you won't
be able to see her.

35:31.251 --> 35:32.550
She's just gonna be living with
me.

35:32.552 --> 35:34.151
No, dummy, that's
exactly what this means.

35:34.153 --> 35:36.153
Since when are you two
assholes moving to Tuscaloosa?

35:36.155 --> 35:36.854
What?

35:36.856 --> 35:38.222
Ongoing investigation.

35:38.224 --> 35:40.358
I've been advised not to speak
to you.

35:40.360 --> 35:43.327
Look, Roz, whatever's
actually happening,

35:43.329 --> 35:44.829
I hope that you and I
can still remain civ...

35:44.831 --> 35:46.329
Yep!

35:53.438 --> 35:57.008
It's
Rosalind. Leave a message.

35:57.876 --> 35:58.943
Hey Roz, it's Jim.

35:58.945 --> 36:00.945
I just lost you, or maybe
your phone died again.

36:00.947 --> 36:02.280
I'd like to continue our
conversation

36:02.282 --> 36:03.581
that we were just having about
Crystal.

36:03.583 --> 36:05.316
I'm happy to talk about
anything and everything

36:05.318 --> 36:06.383
regarding her.

36:06.385 --> 36:08.351
And I wanted to say that
I'm sorry about everything

36:08.353 --> 36:10.921
that I said about you
getting hit by a train.

36:10.923 --> 36:14.258
That was an off-color joke,
obviously.

36:14.260 --> 36:17.494
I would hate to see
anything bad happen to you,

36:17.496 --> 36:19.231
for Crystal's sake.

36:20.867 --> 36:23.534
Uh so, yeah, so OK, I'll leave
you to it.

36:23.536 --> 36:24.536
Take care.

36:29.275 --> 36:31.108
I'm so sorry you had to hear
that, Claire.

36:31.110 --> 36:33.344
Oh, that's fine, I wasn't
listening.

36:33.346 --> 36:36.146
You can talk out here anytime,
sweetie, it's all right.

36:37.516 --> 36:40.584
But I wouldn't let
anybody walk all over me.

36:40.586 --> 36:43.987
I am so sorry to hear about all
that.

36:46.559 --> 36:48.525
So what d'you wanna do?

36:48.527 --> 36:52.195
I wanna drag her behind my
truck with an extension cord.

36:52.197 --> 36:53.965
I don't mean that, don't listen
to me.

36:53.967 --> 36:55.333
I'm just talkin'.

36:55.335 --> 36:57.969
Yeah, we went through
this, me and Sandra.

36:57.971 --> 37:00.070
At least I got to keep
the house and my pension.

37:00.072 --> 37:03.139
Oh, fuck, I didn't
even think about that.

37:03.141 --> 37:05.309
I got a lady, name is Donna.

37:05.311 --> 37:09.347
She's not cheap, but she's
the best in the state.

37:09.349 --> 37:10.349
Money.

37:19.259 --> 37:22.959
So I don't think I'm handlin'
this whole thing that great.

37:22.961 --> 37:24.628
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

37:24.630 --> 37:26.463
Well, I'm glad you're
done

37:26.465 --> 37:30.300
with that everything's fine
bullshit.

37:30.302 --> 37:32.570
Hey, man, it's a good step.

37:32.572 --> 37:34.037
Why don't you come over tonight.

37:34.039 --> 37:35.238
We're having a barbecue at my
place.

37:35.240 --> 37:36.509
No! I'm busy.

37:41.581 --> 37:42.649
So I, hey...

37:44.217 --> 37:46.416
So I danced to that event the
other day.

37:46.418 --> 37:49.487
That event, you know
what I'm talkin' about?

37:49.489 --> 37:51.090
She was a dancer.

37:53.592 --> 37:57.961
I wanted to say goodbye,
I don't really know how.

37:57.963 --> 37:59.563
I think people thought I
was making the whole thing

37:59.565 --> 38:02.235
about me instead of about her.

38:04.202 --> 38:06.237
Shane and Morgan didn't show up.

38:06.239 --> 38:09.005
Somebody's filming it
on their fuckin' phone.

38:09.942 --> 38:13.213
I heard about that; I took
care of it.

38:15.614 --> 38:20.016
So you... That guy doesn't
have that footage anymore?

38:20.018 --> 38:21.018
Nope.

38:21.586 --> 38:23.989
Unless he's a scuba diver.

38:34.333 --> 38:36.032
Hey, Crystal, stop, hold on.

38:36.034 --> 38:38.135
I gotta talk to you about
something important.

38:38.137 --> 38:39.403
What?

38:39.405 --> 38:40.405
Um...

38:45.010 --> 38:47.711
Who's that boy I saw you
talkin' with at school today?

38:47.713 --> 38:50.648
What? Oh, that was Tony.

38:50.650 --> 38:53.284
Yeah, is Tony a slicker?

38:53.286 --> 38:54.617
What?

38:54.619 --> 38:56.753
Does Tony think he's
real slick?

38:56.755 --> 38:58.322
I don't know.

38:58.324 --> 38:59.724
Look, I got nothing against
the guy.

38:59.726 --> 39:01.057
I just think maybe we don't hang
out

39:01.059 --> 39:03.094
with Tony too much anymore, OK?

39:03.096 --> 39:04.996
Why? It's just Tony.

39:04.998 --> 39:05.862
Look, please just listen to
me.

39:05.864 --> 39:06.798
I know what I'm talkin' about,
honey.

39:06.800 --> 39:09.032
You give a mouse a
cookie... Hey, I love you!

39:09.034 --> 39:11.036
I'll see you on Monday!

39:19.545 --> 39:22.079
Jimmy, Roz tell you about
us maybe keeping Crystal?

39:29.422 --> 39:30.420
Lord, thank you for this food

39:30.422 --> 39:33.023
and for watching over
our boys in their work.

39:33.025 --> 39:36.159
Please continue to watch over
our family and our friends

39:36.161 --> 39:37.394
in their time of need.

39:37.396 --> 39:40.030
We ask all this in Jesus' name,
amen.

39:40.032 --> 39:41.699
Amen.

39:41.701 --> 39:44.034
Amen, Celia, that was really
beautiful.

39:44.036 --> 39:45.269
Thank you for saying that.

39:45.271 --> 39:47.304
Oh, thank you for joining our
family.

39:47.306 --> 39:49.572
You always have a spot at this
table.

39:49.574 --> 39:51.675
Tell another story about Dad.

39:51.677 --> 39:54.711
Hey, Jay, man, let him eat.

39:54.713 --> 39:56.146
Probably know all the good
ones,

39:56.148 --> 39:57.115
ones that got him decorated.

39:57.117 --> 39:58.682
You lookin' for more
funny ones there, Ryan?

39:58.684 --> 40:00.383
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

40:00.385 --> 40:01.552
You know the one about
the breaking and entering

40:01.554 --> 40:03.155
about a year ago?

40:04.090 --> 40:05.090
No.

40:06.826 --> 40:08.726
Dad and I got a call, and
it was a breaking and entering

40:08.728 --> 40:10.327
at this house by the interstate.

40:10.329 --> 40:12.729
It was actually one of the
first calls we got, right?

40:12.731 --> 40:15.201
Yeah, drive there, pull up.

40:16.168 --> 40:19.170
All the neighbors are
out on the front lawn.

40:19.172 --> 40:20.804
Dad stays outside, I go inside.

40:20.806 --> 40:22.706
It's every sign of a robbery.

40:22.708 --> 40:24.842
Front door's open, furniture's
flipped,

40:24.844 --> 40:26.677
all these cabinets are open.

40:26.679 --> 40:28.579
There's nobody there, I clear
the house.

40:28.581 --> 40:29.512
I come back outside.

40:29.514 --> 40:32.215
Your dad's still talkin' to the
neighbor.

40:32.217 --> 40:33.416
I guess they went to high school
together.

40:33.418 --> 40:35.219
You went to Jesuit, is that
right?

40:35.221 --> 40:36.623
Yeah, small town.

40:37.856 --> 40:41.224
Anyway, I come up, your dad's
saying,

40:41.226 --> 40:43.461
"Hey, brother, you got a card on
you?"

40:43.463 --> 40:46.630
He goes, "Yeah," and he
reaches into his pocket.

40:46.632 --> 40:48.199
When he pulls his hand out,

40:48.201 --> 40:51.202
his watch catches on all
these gold necklaces,

40:51.204 --> 40:52.869
and they fall out on the
sidewalk,

40:52.871 --> 40:54.704
and we both pull guns on him,
didn't we?

40:54.706 --> 40:57.240
We did!

40:57.242 --> 40:59.311
Now that shit's funny!

41:00.813 --> 41:02.713
I don't get it.

41:02.715 --> 41:04.782
Dad went to help
somebody and it turns out

41:04.784 --> 41:07.851
that they were the ones who
had stolen from the house.

41:07.853 --> 41:08.853
Ooooooh!

41:12.324 --> 41:15.126
How come you couldn't tell?

41:15.128 --> 41:20.200
'Cause sometimes your father
only sees the good in people.

41:26.972 --> 41:28.472
So, Celia, I saw those
pictures

41:28.474 --> 41:29.740
of y'all at the farmers' market.

41:29.742 --> 41:30.673
Those were really beautiful.

41:30.675 --> 41:33.309
Thank you, Nate took those on
his phone,

41:33.311 --> 41:34.445
but they turned out great,
right?

41:34.447 --> 41:35.579
They did!

41:35.581 --> 41:36.445
How did you guys even hear

41:36.447 --> 41:39.682
that there was a farmers' market
uptown?

41:39.684 --> 41:41.851
Oh, um, I don't even know.

41:41.853 --> 41:45.822
It was on a sign or someone... I
forget.

41:45.824 --> 41:47.423
Do you remember?

41:47.425 --> 41:48.492
Nope.

41:48.494 --> 41:51.896
Yeah, is there like a
website or like a chatroom

41:51.898 --> 41:54.798
that'll fill me in on stuff
that's happening around town?

41:54.800 --> 41:56.032
I always see this stuff late,

41:56.034 --> 41:59.670
and it looks like stuff that
we really would've loved to do.

41:59.672 --> 42:02.639
I don't know; it's a good
idea.

42:02.641 --> 42:04.608
I can certainly send you some
stuff...

42:04.610 --> 42:05.943
I would love that, honestly,
really.

42:05.945 --> 42:07.144
- And anything really.
- OK.

42:07.146 --> 42:10.748
I'm just lookin' for fun
kinda family-style activities,

42:10.750 --> 42:13.349
a frameable moment, you know
what I mean?

42:13.351 --> 42:14.651
I do.

42:14.653 --> 42:17.220
Um, we can all go together next
time.

42:17.222 --> 42:18.502
You can borrow our photographer.

42:19.724 --> 42:21.791
I'd like that, and hell, I'll
trade ya.

42:21.793 --> 42:23.827
You can have the recipe
for my potato salad,

42:23.829 --> 42:26.262
if that's even something
you guys would like.

42:33.338 --> 42:35.238
I need you to step away from
that door

42:35.240 --> 42:36.072
and throw that fucking weapon
down!

42:36.074 --> 42:37.374
Put the weapon down,
sir!

42:37.376 --> 42:38.742
Put the weapon down!

42:38.744 --> 42:41.478
Dude, do not go back!

42:41.480 --> 42:43.581
Do not go back! Shit!

42:43.583 --> 42:45.943
Come back with hands up, come
back out of the curtains, sir!

42:46.485 --> 42:48.552
Sir! Come back out and talk to
us, sir.

42:48.554 --> 42:49.820
We're here to help you!

42:49.822 --> 42:51.322
Sir, we just wanna have a
conversation.

42:51.324 --> 42:52.456
Would you put the knife down.

42:52.458 --> 42:53.389
I-I just went to the bathroom!

42:53.391 --> 42:54.124
I need you to leave.

42:54.126 --> 42:54.891
- Ma'am, I need you to go.
- Now?

42:54.893 --> 42:56.526
- I need, now, now!
- Go now?

42:56.528 --> 42:58.762
Come now, come now, go!

42:58.764 --> 43:00.231
Sir, you put that
weapon down and come out here,

43:00.233 --> 43:01.599
we'll all be leaving here on two
feet.

43:01.601 --> 43:02.833
You understand me?

43:07.440 --> 43:08.738
Super gritty.

43:08.740 --> 43:10.374
Yeah, big time.

43:10.376 --> 43:11.941
Sir, I need you to come
out with your hands up

43:11.943 --> 43:12.809
and nothing in them.

43:12.811 --> 43:15.746
Otherwise, I can't ensure your
safety.

43:15.748 --> 43:17.617
Sir, can you hear me?

43:18.784 --> 43:21.653
Sir, I need an auditory
response!

43:38.903 --> 43:40.804
I got him.

43:40.806 --> 43:43.275
Nate, I got him, he's down.

43:46.512 --> 43:48.711
Code four, he's out, I got him.

43:48.713 --> 43:49.715
He's drunk.

43:52.518 --> 43:53.518
Wait.

43:54.820 --> 43:56.487
Wait.

43:58.990 --> 44:00.994
- Sorry.
- Come on!

44:01.893 --> 44:02.758
Call it in...

44:02.760 --> 44:04.327
Call for downtown unit,
11:39.

44:04.329 --> 44:05.162
Call a bus!

44:05.164 --> 44:05.795
Corporation Bar and
Grill,

44:05.797 --> 44:07.831
we need an ambulance ASAP.

44:07.833 --> 44:10.034
Victim is, uh, bleeding.

44:10.036 --> 44:12.568
He's got a self-inflicted knife
wound.

44:12.570 --> 44:15.639
57 East Fifth Street, an
ambulance ASAP.

44:30.356 --> 44:31.354
Mr. Z.

44:31.356 --> 44:35.059
Mr. Arnaud, thank you
so much for coming in.

44:35.061 --> 44:36.059
Thank you for having me.

44:36.061 --> 44:37.661
Officer Arnaud!

44:37.663 --> 44:39.329
- I'm so sorry!
- Totally fine.

44:39.331 --> 44:40.530
Did I miss Crystal and Roz?

44:40.532 --> 44:41.764
Uh, no, I don't know.

44:41.766 --> 44:43.566
I don't think they're comin' in
tonight.

44:43.568 --> 44:44.501
Oh.

44:44.503 --> 44:45.802
But you're here,
that's what's important.

44:45.804 --> 44:47.037
- Yeah, while I have you,
- Yeah.

44:47.039 --> 44:47.871
I wanted to let you know

44:47.873 --> 44:48.838
that I'm gonna be the point
person

44:48.840 --> 44:50.941
for Crystal's education
in the coming years,

44:50.943 --> 44:52.909
just so you can pass that
on to the administration.

44:52.911 --> 44:54.980
OK, I will, thank you.

44:55.914 --> 44:57.050
Shall we sit?

44:58.117 --> 44:59.117
Sure.

45:04.724 --> 45:06.490
Is everything all right?

45:06.492 --> 45:08.891
Oh, I'm fine. I'm workin'.

45:08.893 --> 45:13.130
See me wrestling an alligator,
help... How are you?

45:13.132 --> 45:15.099
I'm great, I'm great, yeah.

45:15.101 --> 45:16.733
The kids are really good this
year.

45:16.735 --> 45:18.034
Good, except for Crystal.

45:19.438 --> 45:21.671
No, no not at all, I wouldn't
say that.

45:21.673 --> 45:23.574
I mean, they're kids, right?

45:23.576 --> 45:26.476
They're kids, obviously
they're all gonna be different.

45:26.478 --> 45:27.344
And you're saying it's her
classwork

45:27.346 --> 45:29.479
she's not excelling at, is that
right?

45:29.481 --> 45:31.849
It's more her performance in
class.

45:31.851 --> 45:35.385
She can be kind of strident
with some of the other kids,

45:35.387 --> 45:37.621
and we just wanted to get
you in and talk about it.

45:37.623 --> 45:38.722
I see.

45:38.724 --> 45:40.624
So you're gonna have to
tell me what strident means.

45:40.626 --> 45:42.559
I went to LSU.

45:42.561 --> 45:44.561
Actually, they said they had
to stop making ice over there

45:44.563 --> 45:48.831
'cause the student with
the recipe graduated.

45:48.833 --> 45:50.800
Oh, yeah.

45:50.802 --> 45:52.702
Uh, Crystal is disruptive,

45:52.704 --> 45:56.407
and she won't listen to
me or her other teachers.

45:56.409 --> 45:58.175
I see, I'm sorry to hear that.

45:58.177 --> 46:00.711
Look, I mean, I have trouble
with her listening, too.

46:00.713 --> 46:02.545
Straight up, I'm the first to
admit it.

46:02.547 --> 46:03.547
Um...

46:04.115 --> 46:06.016
I don't know how much you know,

46:06.018 --> 46:08.084
kind of about what my family's
goin' through right now?

46:08.086 --> 46:09.753
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah.

46:09.755 --> 46:12.722
And, look, I'm just the
messenger here,

46:12.724 --> 46:15.525
but we do have to think about
what's best for all the kids.

46:15.527 --> 46:16.659
Sure.

46:16.661 --> 46:17.894
And so we think it might
just be a simple solution

46:17.896 --> 46:20.697
of moving her to another
homeroom,

46:20.699 --> 46:22.032
and then observing how she gets
along.

46:22.034 --> 46:23.534
Yeah, see, the problem with
that is,

46:23.536 --> 46:25.635
her little friend
Caroline's in this class,

46:25.637 --> 46:26.869
and we think that might be the
only thing

46:26.871 --> 46:27.938
that's keeping her straight.

46:27.940 --> 46:30.206
Yeah, actually, we
already had to separate them

46:30.208 --> 46:31.708
'cause they were talkin' too
much.

46:31.710 --> 46:33.142
So if we move her out,

46:33.144 --> 46:35.679
they're not gonna miss each
other at all.

46:35.681 --> 46:36.681
Oh.

46:38.918 --> 46:41.117
See, I didn't know that.

46:41.119 --> 46:42.086
I get it.

46:42.088 --> 46:44.086
You know, when kids are
outside of the home,

46:44.088 --> 46:46.055
the parents can't see
how they're behaving.

46:46.057 --> 46:46.956
So this can be surprising.

46:46.958 --> 46:48.090
Oh, she's misbehaving?

46:48.092 --> 46:48.958
Well, she used expletives

46:48.960 --> 46:49.925
against some of the other
students,

46:49.927 --> 46:54.197
and she taught them what they
meant, yeah.

46:54.199 --> 46:55.467
All right.

46:59.070 --> 47:01.671
What kind of expletives
are we talkin' about here?

47:01.673 --> 47:03.206
Primarily the one where
someone pleases a gentleman

47:03.208 --> 47:04.810
with their mouth.

47:06.010 --> 47:07.010
Yep.

47:07.646 --> 47:09.880
And then there was another one
where,

47:09.882 --> 47:12.048
in an LGBT relationship,

47:12.050 --> 47:15.786
or I guess really in any
relationship and there's a man

47:15.788 --> 47:18.822
and then someone else
standing behind that man,

47:18.824 --> 47:20.824
and then they, uh, they...

47:20.826 --> 47:24.061
The one behind uses their
hand to reach around to,

47:24.063 --> 47:25.262
- well, it's a reach-around.
- I see.

47:25.264 --> 47:27.097
Is what it is, she called
my classwork a reach-around.

47:27.099 --> 47:28.731
- I am so sorry to hear that.
- Mm-hmm.

47:28.733 --> 47:30.534
I'm certain that couldn't
be further from the truth.

47:30.536 --> 47:31.767
You clearly run a tight ship.

47:31.769 --> 47:32.702
I do!

47:32.704 --> 47:35.572
Let's not, let me first
clarify for you

47:35.574 --> 47:36.673
that she's getting that language

47:36.675 --> 47:39.075
at her mother's house and not
from me.

47:39.077 --> 47:40.947
Mm-hmm, understood.

47:41.780 --> 47:45.182
Look, you can't blame
Crystal for this kinda stuff.

47:45.184 --> 47:46.682
Even with the homework thing,

47:46.684 --> 47:48.519
she gets an assignment on a
Monday.

47:48.521 --> 47:50.521
She does it, but she leaves
it at her mom's house.

47:50.523 --> 47:52.021
I have her for the next few
days.

47:52.023 --> 47:53.956
She doesn't get to you for a
week,

47:53.958 --> 47:55.592
- sometimes weeks at a time.
- Right.

47:55.594 --> 47:56.894
She gets demerits on it.

47:56.896 --> 47:58.628
That's the problem of
living between two homes.

47:58.630 --> 48:00.264
Don't blame her for that, that's
on us.

48:00.266 --> 48:01.697
She's a good student.

48:01.699 --> 48:03.534
Well, she's also been
exhibiting

48:03.536 --> 48:06.938
some pretty serious reading
difficulties.

48:08.673 --> 48:13.746
Well, now, that
she would've gotten from me.

48:19.684 --> 48:21.251
- I'm sorry.
- Mr. Ar...

48:21.253 --> 48:23.153
You gotta give me a
minute, I'm so sorry.

48:23.155 --> 48:24.655
I'm gonna have to hold onto
this desk for a minute.

48:24.657 --> 48:26.188
- Please.
- You gotta stop.

48:26.190 --> 48:27.289
You never wanna hear that.

48:27.291 --> 48:28.624
You never wanna hear you
passed on something terrible

48:28.626 --> 48:30.026
to a child.

48:30.028 --> 48:33.229
Sorry, I'm gonna have to
walk around for a second.

48:33.231 --> 48:34.831
- Mr. Arnaud?
- You gotta stop that!

48:34.833 --> 48:37.233
You gotta stop talkin'
to me, man, shithead.

48:37.235 --> 48:38.735
I didn't mean to call you that.

48:38.737 --> 48:40.670
I'm sorry, that just came out,

48:40.672 --> 48:42.005
and now you think I'm
probably the bad parent

48:42.007 --> 48:42.871
'cause I cursed in front of you.

48:42.873 --> 48:43.840
This whole thing was about her
cursing.

48:43.842 --> 48:45.742
We danced around it for like
five minutes.

48:45.744 --> 48:47.209
This is a fucking nightmare.

48:47.211 --> 48:48.644
- No, no, c'mon...
- Here I am! I cursed again!

48:48.646 --> 48:49.845
Let's calm down, let's calm
down.

48:49.847 --> 48:51.715
Give me a demerit, see if
I give a shit, I don't care.

48:51.717 --> 48:53.983
Dude, I will hum this desk
across the room so fast.

48:53.985 --> 48:57.789
I prefer you don't;
that's Crystal's desk.

49:04.762 --> 49:06.231
Put the desk down.

49:07.800 --> 49:08.800
Please!

49:15.773 --> 49:17.643
Stuff on the floor.

49:36.327 --> 49:39.931
Crystal is temporarily a
problem child.

49:41.300 --> 49:43.300
She's not the worst.

49:43.302 --> 49:46.068
She's certainly not gonna be the
last.

49:46.070 --> 49:47.237
We just needed to get you in
here

49:47.239 --> 49:48.738
so we could form a united front

49:48.740 --> 49:50.374
against the problematic
behavior.

49:50.376 --> 49:52.842
- And I think that's great.
- Great.

49:52.844 --> 49:54.043
Thank you for coming in.

49:54.045 --> 49:57.079
- Thank you for having me.
- OK.

49:57.081 --> 49:57.780
If you have any other questions,

49:57.782 --> 49:59.983
you can feel free to reach out,

49:59.985 --> 50:01.184
and I'm gonna probably send

50:01.186 --> 50:04.755
some reading comprehension
lessons home as a PDF tonight.

50:04.757 --> 50:07.226
I'm goin' through a divorce.

50:09.862 --> 50:11.130
I understand.

50:13.297 --> 50:16.333
It's an emotional time for
everybody.

50:43.996 --> 50:45.695
We good?

50:45.697 --> 50:47.764
Yeah, we're good.

50:59.043 --> 51:01.010
- Thank you.
- Take care.

51:55.768 --> 51:57.400
Sorry I'm late, Jim Arnaud.

51:57.402 --> 51:58.467
Yes, Donna.

51:58.469 --> 51:59.836
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

51:59.838 --> 52:01.505
- Please, slide in.
- Thank you, thank you.

52:01.507 --> 52:03.373
Whoo, you're gonna be fine.

52:03.375 --> 52:05.508
Glad you wore the uniform,
that'll do us good.

52:05.510 --> 52:09.211
Now, remind me what this
is.

52:09.213 --> 52:10.146
It's divorce proceedings.

52:10.148 --> 52:12.249
Oh! I know, I know, OK.

52:12.251 --> 52:16.019
Uh, any verbal abuse,
any trauma, any history?

52:16.021 --> 52:18.287
No, she just stopped loving
me.

52:18.289 --> 52:19.456
We have a daughter together.

52:19.458 --> 52:21.925
OK, and we are arguing
for joint custody.

52:21.927 --> 52:23.894
You don't want to fight for sole
custody?

52:23.896 --> 52:25.061
Oh, I don't think so.

52:25.063 --> 52:26.063
Why not?

52:26.797 --> 52:30.201
Uh, I think she should have
her mom.

52:31.302 --> 52:32.302
Huh.

52:33.038 --> 52:34.038
Huh.

52:35.541 --> 52:36.572
What's up?

52:36.574 --> 52:37.941
McCarthy's tough.

52:37.943 --> 52:40.209
He's gonna be difficult, he's an
asshole.

52:40.211 --> 52:42.244
You don't say anything you don't
have to.

52:42.246 --> 52:43.813
It's best that I take care of
everything.

52:43.815 --> 52:44.847
That's right.

52:44.849 --> 52:46.550
All rise!

52:46.552 --> 52:49.889
The Honorable John Aldredge
McCarthy.

52:52.824 --> 52:54.423
Arnaud v. Arnaud.

52:54.425 --> 52:55.825
Defense?

52:55.827 --> 52:57.026
Your honor, Mrs. Arnaud,

52:57.028 --> 52:59.896
who filed the suit, is not with
us today,

52:59.898 --> 53:02.932
is asking for half her
husband's salary and pension

53:02.934 --> 53:06.235
along with complete custody of
the couple's daughter Crystal

53:06.237 --> 53:10.507
which we're arguing is gross
overreaction to circumstances

53:10.509 --> 53:12.041
and superficial testimony.

53:12.043 --> 53:15.512
OK, let's get the father up
here.

53:15.514 --> 53:18.447
So, I... He asked, he
asked for me, so now I go up?

53:18.449 --> 53:22.120
- Yes, you need to go up.
- So now I go up.

53:23.521 --> 53:24.521
How are you, your honor?

53:24.523 --> 53:25.755
How are you, officer?

53:25.757 --> 53:29.226
I'm doin' just fine,
I'm here for my daughter today.

53:29.228 --> 53:31.161
You have a good job, clearly.

53:31.163 --> 53:33.028
I do indeed.

53:33.030 --> 53:34.231
And you're decorated!

53:34.233 --> 53:36.365
I am, your honor.

53:36.367 --> 53:37.867
Any strikes on your
record?

53:37.869 --> 53:38.869
None.

53:40.572 --> 53:42.472
I'm here fightin' for my
daughter today.

53:42.474 --> 53:44.608
I'd like to continue joint
custody with my wife,

53:44.610 --> 53:46.943
which is what we've
done for the last year,

53:46.945 --> 53:48.347
since everything.

53:49.081 --> 53:51.313
I have no problem with the
way that she raises our child.

53:51.315 --> 53:52.548
I'm a good police officer.

53:52.550 --> 53:54.284
And your wife
has never given you

53:54.286 --> 53:57.052
cause for concern with her child
rearing?

53:57.054 --> 54:00.125
I... That's not, no, short
answer.

54:00.757 --> 54:04.094
I see no problem with the
way that Roz raises Crystal.

54:04.096 --> 54:05.628
She has many problems of her
own.

54:05.630 --> 54:08.430
We have a very separate take
on how we raise our child

54:08.432 --> 54:10.200
from our problems with each
other.

54:10.202 --> 54:12.401
We have a united front against
her problematic behavior,

54:12.403 --> 54:15.005
and Roz is working on
her issues right now.

54:15.007 --> 54:18.374
I've been assured, and
I'm certain that she is.

54:18.376 --> 54:20.043
The court has
testimony

54:20.045 --> 54:23.246
that you practiced reckless
or violent behavior,

54:23.248 --> 54:25.447
a public event, a funeral this
month.

54:25.449 --> 54:27.452
Any of that hold water?

54:31.023 --> 54:32.557
I wasn't violent.

54:36.961 --> 54:38.561
I wasn't violent.

54:38.563 --> 54:41.965
I was upset for sure, I
lost somebody I loved,

54:41.967 --> 54:43.635
but I wasn't violent.

54:44.469 --> 54:45.434
And actually everybody
I've been speaking to

54:45.436 --> 54:47.537
say that's pretty normal when
you find out

54:47.539 --> 54:51.206
what losing somebody in
your life means.

54:51.208 --> 54:52.374
I hope that when you're
lookin' at the coffin

54:52.376 --> 54:53.543
of somebody you love,

54:53.545 --> 54:58.447
you act with a little more
grace than I did.

54:58.449 --> 55:00.184
Is that a threat?

55:03.521 --> 55:05.090
Absolutely not.

55:06.190 --> 55:08.557
No, I'm sorry, let's go back.

55:08.559 --> 55:12.061
I didn't mean for it to come out
that way.

55:12.063 --> 55:15.030
Why don't you go back and
sit down with your counsel.

55:15.032 --> 55:16.231
I'm so sorry. No! Let's go...

55:16.233 --> 55:17.499
That's, I didn't mean it like
that.

55:17.501 --> 55:18.434
I don't have to go back and...

55:18.436 --> 55:20.070
That's, let's just have a
conversation.

55:20.072 --> 55:21.137
That's why I came up
here in the first place.

55:21.139 --> 55:22.139
You're on one side of the
law, I'm on the other.

55:22.141 --> 55:23.505
I thought we were gonna
have a heart-to-heart

55:23.507 --> 55:24.606
or somethin' like that.

55:24.608 --> 55:27.543
Why don't you go sit back
down with your counsel.

55:27.545 --> 55:28.512
'Cause now I'm scared
I'm gonna lose my daughter

55:28.514 --> 55:32.518
'cause I said somethin'
stupid to the judge.

55:39.056 --> 55:42.124
Thank you so much, your honor.

55:42.126 --> 55:43.626
Why did you let me do that?

55:43.628 --> 55:45.528
- Why did you let me do that?
- Don't, don't, don't.

55:45.530 --> 55:47.063
- Why did you let me do that?
- Don't, don't, don't.

55:47.065 --> 55:48.365
What did I do wrong?

55:48.367 --> 55:49.733
The fuck off, Chris.

55:49.735 --> 55:50.566
Don't show any emotion.

55:50.568 --> 55:53.702
You just stand up, leave, go
home,

55:53.704 --> 55:55.505
and we will go back to my
offices in the morning,

55:55.507 --> 55:56.572
and we will file a motion
for a continuation.

55:56.574 --> 55:57.641
So what does that mean, we
lost?

55:57.643 --> 55:59.476
That means we lost today.

55:59.478 --> 56:02.512
No, listen, no, because we're
gonna file a motion for...

56:02.514 --> 56:05.782
I think we can
reach a tentative ruling.

56:05.784 --> 56:08.717
We have an exhibit I am
told we are not to miss!

56:08.719 --> 56:11.189
Clerk, please, the exhibit.

56:32.077 --> 56:33.077
Fuck!

56:36.181 --> 56:37.046
Jim!

56:37.048 --> 56:37.981
What happened?

56:37.983 --> 56:39.182
What do you mean, what
happened?

56:39.184 --> 56:39.816
What happened? They had
the footage at the courtroom!

56:39.818 --> 56:40.516
What happened with what?

56:40.518 --> 56:40.950
I thought you took care of it!

56:40.952 --> 56:42.651
What? What?

56:42.653 --> 56:43.686
I thoughtyou took care of it!

56:43.688 --> 56:44.686
They had the fucking
footage in the courtroom!

56:44.688 --> 56:45.688
I-I-I-I did! I threw
it in the fuckin' lake!

56:45.690 --> 56:47.757
Or, he musta got, it's,
it's up in the cloud!

56:47.759 --> 56:48.758
What? No, they had it
in the fuckin' ourtroom!

56:48.760 --> 56:49.624
The cloud? What're you
talkin' about, asshole!

56:49.626 --> 56:50.760
What're you talkin' about? I
did...

56:50.762 --> 56:52.962
- They fuckin' had the thing...
- I did my job! I tried!

56:53.498 --> 56:54.396
I paid your fucki' fancy
lawyer...

56:54.398 --> 56:55.831
Calm down, man, that's not
necessary!

56:55.833 --> 56:56.666
- You don't have to...
- I had to fuckin'

56:56.668 --> 56:57.733
pay for your fuckin' lawyer,
asshole!

56:57.735 --> 56:59.601
- Don't you fuckin' hit me!
- You fuckin' ass...

56:59.603 --> 57:01.804
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Stay down!

57:01.806 --> 57:03.773
- Stay down! Stop!
- Ow! The fuck!

57:03.775 --> 57:04.440
You ripped my pants!

57:04.442 --> 57:05.141
You fuckin' hit me!

57:05.143 --> 57:05.842
You ripped my pants, asshole!

57:05.844 --> 57:06.708
You punched me in the face!

57:06.710 --> 57:07.376
You slapped in in the fuckin'
face!

57:07.378 --> 57:09.644
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

57:09.646 --> 57:10.679
You ripped my fuckin'
pnts! You ruined my life!

57:10.681 --> 57:11.380
- I never ruined your life!
- You ruined my...

57:11.382 --> 57:12.081
I saw that goddamned video!

57:12.083 --> 57:14.117
Who dances at a fuckin' funeral!

57:14.119 --> 57:15.351
In my culture, we do that!
That's our...

57:15.353 --> 57:17.287
That's not your fuckin' culture!

57:17.289 --> 57:18.688
- Fuck you!
- Don't put this shit on me!

57:18.690 --> 57:20.322
I spent all this money
on your fuckin' lawyer,

57:20.324 --> 57:21.190
and I lost, asshole!

57:21.192 --> 57:22.758
I've always been a good friend
to you,

57:22.760 --> 57:24.661
- You ruined my life!
- You sad son of a bitch!

57:24.663 --> 57:25.894
You ruined my fuckin'
life!

57:25.896 --> 57:28.231
I'll tell the rest of
these mother fuckers about...

57:28.233 --> 57:29.231
- You have a nice family!
- Jimmy.

57:29.233 --> 57:30.499
- You don't have problems!
- Jimmy.

57:30.501 --> 57:31.568
- Yes, I do!
- No, you don't!

57:31.570 --> 57:32.434
Yes, I do!

57:32.436 --> 57:33.436
James Edward!

57:33.438 --> 57:34.438
What!

57:48.753 --> 57:49.753
It's fine.

57:51.422 --> 57:53.255
It's all right.

57:53.257 --> 57:54.324
I'm putting it away.

57:54.326 --> 57:55.557
Put the gun down
now!

57:55.559 --> 57:57.226
No, it's really fine.

57:57.228 --> 57:59.162
I'm just glad he put it away in
time.

57:59.164 --> 58:00.162
It's not fine.

58:00.164 --> 58:02.365
You put the gun down,
you put the badge down.

58:02.367 --> 58:03.900
That's quite enough out of you!

58:03.902 --> 58:05.300
Oh, what, am I fired?

58:05.302 --> 58:06.469
Yes.

58:06.471 --> 58:08.237
Why, 'cause of this?

58:08.239 --> 58:09.072
This is nothing!

58:09.074 --> 58:12.244
This guy is my brother, this
guy's...

58:18.650 --> 58:19.852
Oh, all right.

58:21.152 --> 58:22.385
Yeah, that's fine.

58:22.387 --> 58:24.220
I don't fuckin' care, that's
fine.

58:24.222 --> 58:25.822
I don't wanna fuckin' work here
anyway.

58:25.824 --> 58:27.423
Y'all can take my shit.

58:27.425 --> 58:28.624
You think I give a shit?

58:28.626 --> 58:30.827
I had to watch a guy fall on
his fuckin' knife last week!

58:30.829 --> 58:32.896
You think I need that shit right
now?

58:32.898 --> 58:34.597
You're a bad
influence.

58:34.599 --> 58:36.398
I'm a bad influence?

58:36.400 --> 58:38.735
I'm the most decorated
motherfucker out here!

58:38.737 --> 58:39.635
I'm a bad influence.

58:39.637 --> 58:40.769
Think I give a shit?

58:40.771 --> 58:43.773
They don't know, they don't
know.

58:43.775 --> 58:45.641
They don't know! They don't
know!

58:45.643 --> 58:46.943
They don't know.

58:46.945 --> 58:49.311
You want me to talk?

58:49.313 --> 58:50.545
Yeah, I'll talk.

58:50.547 --> 58:53.950
Ask me to talk, fuck, I'll talk
all day, the day I'm havin'.

58:53.952 --> 58:55.885
Yeah, you don't want me to talk.

58:55.887 --> 58:58.420
I got dirt on all a y'all!

58:58.422 --> 58:59.755
Shit!

58:59.757 --> 59:00.690
Fuck!

59:00.692 --> 59:02.659
I'll be out here, try gettin'
off duty!

59:02.661 --> 59:05.961
I will ruin the parking lot
experience for all of you!

59:05.963 --> 59:10.233
I'll talk all night,
right here, motherfuckers.

59:10.235 --> 59:11.133
I'll start with myself.

59:11.135 --> 59:13.403
My wife left me a year and a
half ago.

59:13.405 --> 59:15.671
There, laugh it up!

59:15.673 --> 59:17.507
Does that change anything?

59:17.509 --> 59:19.242
No!

59:19.244 --> 59:21.610
Am I cured? 'Course not!

59:21.612 --> 59:26.284
Talkin' about your problems
never helped anybody ever!

59:28.519 --> 59:30.188
I slept in my car!

59:31.590 --> 59:33.389
Right here, three weeks!

59:33.391 --> 59:35.557
Jerry saw it, isn't that right,
Jerry?

59:35.559 --> 59:37.392
Yeah, I brought you
breakfast.

59:37.394 --> 59:39.662
Thank you so much for doing
that, Jerry.

59:39.664 --> 59:41.597
That meant a lot back then.

59:41.599 --> 59:43.532
But fuck you right now.

59:43.534 --> 59:44.200
You're drunk!

59:44.202 --> 59:45.534
I'm not drunk; I'm angry.

59:45.536 --> 59:46.668
I realize that, I'll calm...

59:46.670 --> 59:48.604
No! I won't calm down!

59:48.606 --> 59:53.342
I lost my daughter today!

59:53.344 --> 59:55.613
And I did everything right!

59:56.748 --> 59:58.248
She was comin'!

59:58.250 --> 01:00:00.516
I got married, man, my
whole family was there!

01:00:00.518 --> 01:00:01.920
It was beautiful!

01:00:03.320 --> 01:00:06.755
I haven't had a good
night's sleep since 2009

01:00:06.757 --> 01:00:08.791
because of this shit!

01:00:08.793 --> 01:00:10.262
Fuck! For what!

01:00:11.028 --> 01:00:13.429
So I could impress you
overweight assholes!

01:00:13.431 --> 01:00:16.298
I gave up my fuckin' family!

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.969
Why? For decorations?

01:00:19.003 --> 01:00:20.436
For armed marksman!

01:00:20.438 --> 01:00:23.405
You think I give a shit
about armed marksman!

01:00:23.407 --> 01:00:25.508
Clara! Fuck you.

01:00:25.510 --> 01:00:27.342
And the rest of it!

01:00:27.344 --> 01:00:28.911
What? You want my pants, too!

01:00:28.913 --> 01:00:29.878
Fine!

01:00:29.880 --> 01:00:32.581
Fuck you, you can keep 'em, I
don't care.

01:00:32.583 --> 01:00:33.883
You can't hurt me!

01:00:33.885 --> 01:00:34.883
You think you're fuckin' hurtin'
me?

01:00:34.885 --> 01:00:38.354
I found out she lost her
boyfriend in Vietnam!

01:00:38.356 --> 01:00:41.057
I never asked her about it!

01:00:41.059 --> 01:00:43.729
Why?

01:00:44.963 --> 01:00:46.898
I never made the time.

01:00:48.867 --> 01:00:53.939
I was selfish.

01:00:55.907 --> 01:01:00.979
This is what you get!

01:01:07.018 --> 01:01:08.619
I'm walkin' home.

01:01:10.588 --> 01:01:11.787
I hope they take my house.

01:01:11.789 --> 01:01:13.992
Now I really have nothin'.

01:01:16.827 --> 01:01:18.764
I really have nothin'.

01:01:23.001 --> 01:01:27.472
I hope I get hit by a truck
full of fuckin' cement.

01:03:12.844 --> 01:03:13.844
Jimmy!

01:03:16.481 --> 01:03:18.683
Brother Nathaniel!

01:03:34.833 --> 01:03:37.568
You ready to lose some money?

01:03:41.206 --> 01:03:43.008
Didn't go so well.

01:03:44.842 --> 01:03:46.978
Didn't go so well, huh?

01:03:48.980 --> 01:03:51.182
Judge was not a nice guy.

01:03:51.782 --> 01:03:54.853
Yeah, that happens,
man.

01:03:59.056 --> 01:04:03.594
I'm sorry if I committed
a hate crime against you.

01:04:05.762 --> 01:04:07.965
Yeah, I... I forgive you.

01:04:09.501 --> 01:04:10.532
Hey, why don't you come on
downstairs,

01:04:10.534 --> 01:04:12.536
and we play some cards?

01:04:15.639 --> 01:04:18.809
I don't know what I'm doing
anymore.

01:04:22.547 --> 01:04:27.085
Cleanin' the house, the vacuum
cleaner stopped workin'.

01:04:29.253 --> 01:04:33.991
I turned it over, and it was
all caught up in her hair.

01:04:35.059 --> 01:04:38.994
It was perfect.

01:04:38.996 --> 01:04:42.164
Looked just like the
top of her little head.

01:04:42.166 --> 01:04:43.235
I kissed it.

01:04:45.670 --> 01:04:48.005
I kissed the vacuum cleaner.

01:04:53.945 --> 01:04:56.112
I was lookin' into getting
an above-ground pool

01:04:56.114 --> 01:04:57.715
for the backyard.

01:04:59.951 --> 01:05:02.083
I went down to the showroom.

01:05:02.085 --> 01:05:04.186
This guy Ray-ray showed me
around.

01:05:04.188 --> 01:05:05.554
I thought they'd be expensive.

01:05:05.556 --> 01:05:08.626
They're pretty reasonable,
actually.

01:05:12.797 --> 01:05:13.628
I was hoping we could've been

01:05:13.630 --> 01:05:16.867
one of the cool kids in high
school.

01:05:18.969 --> 01:05:22.106
They'd all come over here and
cut up.

01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.641
I'd stay out of the way.

01:05:25.643 --> 01:05:29.077
They'd all be out there at
night.

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:31.780
I'd let 'em think they were
gettin' away with murder,

01:05:31.782 --> 01:05:33.950
but I'd be the one to call
all the parents and say,

01:05:33.952 --> 01:05:37.987
"Yeah, they're here, and
yeah, they're drinkin',

01:05:37.989 --> 01:05:41.927
"but they're safe; I'm
keepin' an eye on 'em."

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:49.934
I don't know what I'm doin'
anymore, man.

01:05:50.335 --> 01:05:52.267
Hey,
is he there? Is he hurt?

01:05:52.269 --> 01:05:55.304
No, no, no, no, he's uh... he's
fine.

01:05:55.306 --> 01:05:56.574
Listen, I...

01:05:57.309 --> 01:05:59.641
I need you to come get me from
Jim's in a couple of hours.

01:05:59.643 --> 01:06:01.911
- Can you do that?
- Really? OK.

01:06:01.913 --> 01:06:03.813
Great, all right.

01:06:03.815 --> 01:06:04.815
Hey...

01:06:08.318 --> 01:06:09.320
I love you.

01:06:10.755 --> 01:06:12.722
I love you so much, we're
so lucky.

01:06:12.724 --> 01:06:14.956
Oh, honey, I'm so
sorry.

01:06:14.958 --> 01:06:19.295
- Yeah, all right, I love you.
- I love you.

01:06:19.297 --> 01:06:20.297
Hey!

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:31.673
What happened to the fridge?

01:06:31.675 --> 01:06:32.677
Um, yeah.

01:06:33.777 --> 01:06:35.779
There was a fist fight.

01:06:36.413 --> 01:06:38.882
I thought it was a burglar.

01:06:39.751 --> 01:06:40.751
OK.

01:06:42.853 --> 01:06:45.186
Wait, are we still goin' to
dinner?

01:06:45.188 --> 01:06:47.324
Nope, we're doin' this.

01:06:52.664 --> 01:06:53.963
Two.

01:06:53.965 --> 01:06:55.664
I don't even know where that one
went!

01:06:55.666 --> 01:06:56.599
She was doin' this thing.

01:06:56.601 --> 01:06:59.834
She was selling medical
equipment online.

01:06:59.836 --> 01:07:02.438
I think she went to Cincinnati,
and she texted me once.

01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:06.978
I was here, and she said,
"Hey, you wanna make out?"

01:07:08.079 --> 01:07:08.911
And I think she was drunk,

01:07:08.913 --> 01:07:10.845
or at least she said she was
drunk.

01:07:12.849 --> 01:07:14.249
But from the
beginning,

01:07:14.251 --> 01:07:17.019
I thought she must be
texting somebody else

01:07:17.021 --> 01:07:18.320
and accidentally texted me.

01:07:18.322 --> 01:07:19.320
Hey, asshole.

01:07:19.322 --> 01:07:21.691
And
I called her out on it,

01:07:21.693 --> 01:07:22.992
and I spent the week in a motel.

01:07:22.994 --> 01:07:25.026
- Hmmm?
- No, no, no, not yet.

01:07:25.028 --> 01:07:26.394
I'm fuckin' Babe Ruth!

01:07:26.396 --> 01:07:28.863
Well, then, you fuckin'
better...

01:07:37.375 --> 01:07:38.074
Woo-hee!

01:07:38.076 --> 01:07:39.240
Hit me again.

01:07:39.242 --> 01:07:40.909
I can, I can fix that for you.

01:07:40.911 --> 01:07:42.077
Lemme see.

01:07:42.079 --> 01:07:43.813
I mean, we got this
thing a couple years ago.

01:07:43.815 --> 01:07:44.847
It's a piece of shit.

01:07:44.849 --> 01:07:47.483
- Lemme see.
- Whatever.

01:07:47.485 --> 01:07:51.420
Yeah, look, these are
all done up for knuckles

01:07:51.422 --> 01:07:54.423
so you can put your hands down
like that.

01:07:54.425 --> 01:07:58.293
So you gotta make sure
that when you're doin' it,

01:07:58.295 --> 01:08:01.796
it's like exactly for the palm
of the hand

01:08:01.798 --> 01:08:03.733
so that it fits perfectly in.

01:08:03.735 --> 01:08:06.869
They say a stitch in time saves
nine.

01:08:06.871 --> 01:08:09.438
So you do it once right,

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:13.778
you don't have to do it
nine times in the future.

01:08:16.779 --> 01:08:18.381
Sounds good to me.

01:08:19.951 --> 01:08:21.082
Thanks for comin' over, man.

01:08:21.085 --> 01:08:23.118
Glad to do it, man.

01:08:23.121 --> 01:08:25.256
That's what I'm here for.

01:08:49.046 --> 01:08:52.149
Oh! Stop!

01:09:15.471 --> 01:09:17.305
Hey, oh my god!

01:09:17.307 --> 01:09:18.874
You guys got so big!

01:09:18.876 --> 01:09:19.541
How's it goin'?

01:09:19.542 --> 01:09:20.408
Good.

01:09:20.411 --> 01:09:21.277
You mom home?

01:09:21.279 --> 01:09:22.143
Yes.

01:09:22.145 --> 01:09:22.844
All right.

01:09:22.845 --> 01:09:23.578
Gimme one of these.

01:09:23.581 --> 01:09:24.446
Oh, hey, man!

01:09:24.448 --> 01:09:25.379
Take it easy, you'll break my
hand.

01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:27.148
What, are you Hulk Hogan?

01:09:27.149 --> 01:09:29.551
Get outta here.

01:09:31.956 --> 01:09:33.121
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Hey, Morgan.

01:09:33.122 --> 01:09:34.323
How are you?

01:09:40.064 --> 01:09:42.197
How was your drive?

01:09:42.198 --> 01:09:43.064
Oh, it was fine.

01:09:43.067 --> 01:09:44.265
Yeah, it's two hours.

01:09:44.268 --> 01:09:46.402
It's uh, I can do it in one
sitting.

01:09:46.404 --> 01:09:47.402
Well, come on in.

01:09:47.404 --> 01:09:48.870
Can I get you somethin'?

01:09:48.872 --> 01:09:50.471
Ah, I'm fine.

01:09:50.474 --> 01:09:52.241
Actually, a big glass
of water would be great.

01:09:52.243 --> 01:09:53.243
Sure.

01:09:54.045 --> 01:09:55.910
So it's all settled?

01:09:55.912 --> 01:09:56.914
How was it?

01:09:57.948 --> 01:09:59.548
It was tough.

01:09:59.550 --> 01:10:01.317
A lot of people were there.

01:10:01.319 --> 01:10:03.117
Everybody's asking for ya.

01:10:03.119 --> 01:10:04.186
Not like they were bein' rude.

01:10:04.188 --> 01:10:07.455
They just missed seeing
you and Jeff and the kids.

01:10:07.457 --> 01:10:08.322
They've grown up.

01:10:08.324 --> 01:10:10.893
They have. I heard that would
happen.

01:10:10.895 --> 01:10:12.393
With Peyton, he's at practice,

01:10:12.395 --> 01:10:14.162
I just wanna put a brick on his
head

01:10:14.164 --> 01:10:16.432
and keep him at the same size
forever.

01:10:16.434 --> 01:10:18.634
It's a good age.

01:10:18.636 --> 01:10:20.468
So you got your appeal coming
up?

01:10:20.470 --> 01:10:22.137
That's good news.

01:10:22.139 --> 01:10:25.040
Yeah, my attorney
has it all figured out.

01:10:25.042 --> 01:10:28.143
She wants me to attack Roz's
character moving forward,

01:10:28.145 --> 01:10:30.245
problems with everything.

01:10:30.247 --> 01:10:32.647
I've been forthwith
with you about all that.

01:10:32.649 --> 01:10:35.250
I don't want to make her
out to be some kind of a...

01:10:35.252 --> 01:10:37.285
A B-word in front of a judge,

01:10:37.287 --> 01:10:38.987
but now they're thinkin' I
shoulda just been honest,

01:10:38.989 --> 01:10:42.223
that my wife, in fact, in
this case, specifically,

01:10:42.225 --> 01:10:44.293
is probably the biggest one of
them all.

01:10:44.295 --> 01:10:45.963
Thank you so much.

01:10:51.135 --> 01:10:52.668
So we're just doin' that until
the fifth,

01:10:52.670 --> 01:10:55.236
tweakin' it everyday, makin' it
perfect.

01:10:55.238 --> 01:10:56.537
I'm takin' some time off.

01:10:56.539 --> 01:10:59.077
Captain's asked me to, um...

01:11:00.411 --> 01:11:01.411
Uh...

01:11:05.015 --> 01:11:06.617
It's a mess, Morgan.

01:11:08.051 --> 01:11:10.188
The whole thing's a mess.

01:11:14.292 --> 01:11:15.258
Did you hear about

01:11:15.260 --> 01:11:19.227
when Mom had to back
out of the conservatory?

01:11:19.229 --> 01:11:20.898
What's that? No.

01:11:22.233 --> 01:11:24.400
Mom had her knee happen
earlier in the year,

01:11:24.402 --> 01:11:27.268
and Brittany Ray had just
taken over at the ballet or,

01:11:27.270 --> 01:11:28.202
or I think it was around then,

01:11:28.204 --> 01:11:30.606
that they had come to her to do
Swan Lake.

01:11:30.608 --> 01:11:32.441
And she'd done it in the '90s.

01:11:32.443 --> 01:11:33.976
Actually, I think it was seein'
that show

01:11:33.978 --> 01:11:35.611
that made her want to be a
dancer.

01:11:35.613 --> 01:11:38.682
Pawpaw took her; she was just a
kid.

01:11:39.951 --> 01:11:41.650
Anyhow, they wanted her
for it.

01:11:41.652 --> 01:11:44.053
For Odette, the princess role?

01:11:44.055 --> 01:11:45.987
And it was just for the
Tulane Conservatory, you know.

01:11:45.989 --> 01:11:47.723
It was no big deal or nothin',

01:11:47.725 --> 01:11:49.724
but she went through
three rounds of callbacks

01:11:49.726 --> 01:11:52.393
before she finally admitted
that she had had the surgery,

01:11:52.395 --> 01:11:54.696
and that workin' so hard
and doing those rehearsals

01:11:54.698 --> 01:11:58.267
was the real reason that
she ruined her knee.

01:11:58.269 --> 01:12:00.169
She couldn't do it anymore.

01:12:00.171 --> 01:12:03.307
That's why she taught from the
chair.

01:12:04.542 --> 01:12:06.241
When was that?

01:12:06.243 --> 01:12:11.316
Would've been
after the storm, 2006, 2007.

01:12:13.117 --> 01:12:15.483
I have no memory of that.

01:12:15.485 --> 01:12:17.352
Where wa... Was I at the academy?

01:12:17.354 --> 01:12:19.187
Oh, she never told anybody.

01:12:19.189 --> 01:12:22.691
I had to hear about it from
Brittany last week.

01:12:22.693 --> 01:12:24.259
I mean, can you imagine?

01:12:24.261 --> 01:12:26.995
She was driving an hour
every night to kill her knee

01:12:26.997 --> 01:12:28.330
because she couldn't admit to
anyone

01:12:28.332 --> 01:12:31.066
that she wasn't up to it.

01:12:31.068 --> 01:12:33.538
God, she was sneaky like that.

01:12:35.139 --> 01:12:37.141
That's how we lost her.

01:12:38.141 --> 01:12:39.141
Anyway.

01:12:50.787 --> 01:12:55.391
What was it like growin'
up with her as a mom?

01:12:55.393 --> 01:12:57.328
As a daughter, I mean.

01:12:59.229 --> 01:13:04.234
You feel like, as a girl, growin'
up with a mom was enough?

01:13:07.238 --> 01:13:08.439
It was fine.

01:13:11.375 --> 01:13:15.576
Everybody wants two
parents.

01:13:15.578 --> 01:13:19.415
I got no more tears for that,
hardly.

01:13:19.417 --> 01:13:23.117
You two didn't have the
pressure to be successful.

01:13:23.119 --> 01:13:25.353
Y'all were already doing well,

01:13:25.355 --> 01:13:27.289
and I know we talked about
this at the barbecue,

01:13:27.291 --> 01:13:30.094
but I just never got the feeling

01:13:30.828 --> 01:13:34.098
that she ever really approved of
me.

01:13:35.599 --> 01:13:39.537
Yeah, yeah, I remember
hearing you say that.

01:13:40.537 --> 01:13:44.238
Remember drivin' home and
I was thinkin' about...

01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:45.339
What that would look like,

01:13:45.341 --> 01:13:49.077
a parent who doesn't approve
of their child, but...

01:13:49.079 --> 01:13:50.845
I mean, she never acted like to
you.

01:13:50.847 --> 01:13:52.680
So I don't know where that comes
from.

01:13:52.682 --> 01:13:54.415
I mean, Jeff and I started so
quick,

01:13:54.417 --> 01:13:56.617
and she was there to help
with the boys and everything,

01:13:56.619 --> 01:13:58.553
but she didn't come to
half the birthday parties

01:13:58.555 --> 01:14:00.488
that she did for Crystal.

01:14:00.490 --> 01:14:02.391
Oh, don't, I mean, y'all live
out here.

01:14:02.393 --> 01:14:04.226
Well, I woulda gone and picked
her up.

01:14:04.228 --> 01:14:06.428
We built that room for
her at the top of the stairs,

01:14:06.430 --> 01:14:10.232
and she only used it but the one
time.

01:14:10.234 --> 01:14:12.134
She gave you Mawmaw's earrings,

01:14:12.136 --> 01:14:14.472
and you can't even wear 'em.

01:14:16.439 --> 01:14:21.511
I don't know.

01:14:21.912 --> 01:14:23.314
You got money?

01:14:25.416 --> 01:14:26.781
What?

01:14:26.783 --> 01:14:28.784
Oh, yeah, no, that's...

01:14:28.786 --> 01:14:30.384
Go on with what you were sayin'.

01:14:30.386 --> 01:14:33.254
I can't do this right now.

01:14:33.256 --> 01:14:34.723
I got this stupid meeting in an
hour,

01:14:34.725 --> 01:14:37.893
and I gotta get ready for it.

01:14:37.895 --> 01:14:43.167
I'm gonna get all worked
up.

01:14:44.568 --> 01:14:47.371
I've caught you at a bad time.

01:14:48.037 --> 01:14:51.440
No, uh, stay and
we'll have dinner later,

01:14:51.442 --> 01:14:53.509
and I just got a bunch of
breakfast stuff for tomorrow.

01:14:53.511 --> 01:14:54.742
It's fine.

01:14:54.744 --> 01:14:56.144
I just wanted to see you and
let you know how I was doin'.

01:14:56.146 --> 01:14:57.112
Jimmy, stay!

01:14:57.114 --> 01:14:57.745
You wouldn't have driven
all the way out here

01:14:57.747 --> 01:14:58.246
if you weren't gonna stay.

01:14:58.248 --> 01:14:59.180
You woulda called.

01:14:59.182 --> 01:15:00.816
That's all right, I'll call
next time.

01:15:00.818 --> 01:15:03.152
Jimmy, don't be difficult.

01:15:03.154 --> 01:15:05.586
That's my middle name, isn't
it?

01:15:05.588 --> 01:15:07.388
Let's do that phone call
sometime soon.

01:15:07.390 --> 01:15:09.258
I'm lookin' forward to it.

01:15:09.260 --> 01:15:11.262
Yeah, that'd be nice.

01:15:12.863 --> 01:15:14.731
You want a to go cup?

01:16:44.020 --> 01:16:46.456
Hey, Mom, this is stupid.

01:16:59.869 --> 01:17:01.503
So, yeah, so I lost Crystal,

01:17:01.505 --> 01:17:02.336
and I don't know what to do,

01:17:02.338 --> 01:17:05.674
and I wish you were here to tell
me.

01:17:05.676 --> 01:17:07.041
Sometimes I'm actually glad
you're not

01:17:07.043 --> 01:17:09.277
'cause you'd be ashamed of me.

01:17:09.279 --> 01:17:10.279
I get it.

01:17:11.515 --> 01:17:12.984
I guess I'm lucky.

01:17:16.886 --> 01:17:19.754
But I did everything that I
could,

01:17:19.756 --> 01:17:22.523
and I had to sell the dance
academy to pay for the lawyers,

01:17:22.525 --> 01:17:26.663
and I lost, I'm sorry.

01:17:28.765 --> 01:17:30.999
I wish I could go back.

01:17:31.001 --> 01:17:34.939
I'd a done it different,
I'd a listened to ya.

01:17:36.539 --> 01:17:40.375
Your headstone looks
beautiful, by the way.

01:17:40.377 --> 01:17:45.416
A lot of these are pretty
tacky yeah.

01:17:47.717 --> 01:17:51.454
Yours is nice; it just
says "Mother" on it.

01:17:53.524 --> 01:17:55.824
I thought it was gonna be spooky
out here.

01:17:55.826 --> 01:17:58.429
It's not bad. I'll come back.

01:17:59.630 --> 01:18:01.966
Hate to think you're lonely.

01:18:03.701 --> 01:18:04.701
Anyway.

01:18:06.337 --> 01:18:10.841
If you're tryin' to help me,
you don't have to anymore.

01:18:12.009 --> 01:18:14.011
Help Morgan if you can.

01:18:44.742 --> 01:18:46.674
What's goin' on? I'm
sober!

01:18:46.676 --> 01:18:47.942
Hey, it's me!

01:18:47.944 --> 01:18:48.610
I'm sober!

01:18:48.612 --> 01:18:49.745
I'm sober, what's goin' on?

01:18:49.747 --> 01:18:50.879
Pick up your phone.

01:18:50.881 --> 01:18:51.812
What?

01:18:51.814 --> 01:18:55.650
Your phone! Pick up
your phone.

01:18:57.387 --> 01:18:58.519
What's goin'
on? I've been drinkin'.

01:18:58.521 --> 01:19:00.054
They're tryin' to call
you.

01:19:00.056 --> 01:19:00.921
I'm locked, I'm locked
out.

01:19:00.923 --> 01:19:02.891
I locked myself out of my car, I
guess.

01:19:02.893 --> 01:19:03.758
What's goin' on?

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.794
I don't... They just sent
me to...

01:19:05.796 --> 01:19:07.094
Oh, you don't know!

01:19:07.096 --> 01:19:08.095
- Fuckin' find out!
- OK.

01:19:08.097 --> 01:19:09.764
Why would you pull me
over if you don't know!

01:19:09.766 --> 01:19:10.799
- OK, I call it...
- What's goin' on?

01:19:10.801 --> 01:19:11.366
- Why do they need me?
- I'll call it in!

01:19:11.368 --> 01:19:13.701
Goddamn! Is my house?

01:19:13.703 --> 01:19:15.803
What's your name again, Doug?

01:19:15.805 --> 01:19:16.806
Fuck, Doug!

01:19:17.841 --> 01:19:18.841
Goddamn!

01:19:20.042 --> 01:19:21.042
Goddamn!

01:19:27.484 --> 01:19:30.117
Ow! Ow! Ow!

01:19:30.119 --> 01:19:31.419
Fuck! You got a stick?

01:19:31.421 --> 01:19:32.486
Hey! You got a
stick?

01:19:32.488 --> 01:19:33.623
Yep.

01:19:42.533 --> 01:19:43.964
How do I, how do I, all right.

01:19:43.966 --> 01:19:46.768
Does it have a little coop on
it?

01:19:51.475 --> 01:19:52.476
Goddamn it.

01:19:53.076 --> 01:19:55.910
Fuck me.

01:19:55.912 --> 01:19:57.144
It's dead, it's dead.

01:19:57.146 --> 01:19:59.046
The battery life on these
fuckin' things.

01:19:59.048 --> 01:20:00.449
270 Winthrop?

01:20:00.451 --> 01:20:02.920
That's my wife's house, 270?

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.687
That's my wife's house.

01:20:10.127 --> 01:20:12.693
What happened? What
happened?

01:20:12.695 --> 01:20:14.094
- She's fine.
- What happened?

01:20:14.096 --> 01:20:14.762
Honey, what happened?

01:20:14.764 --> 01:20:15.863
She's just fine, she's OK.

01:20:15.865 --> 01:20:16.731
What happened?

01:20:16.733 --> 01:20:18.165
Are you OK? What happened?

01:20:18.167 --> 01:20:19.201
What happened?

01:20:29.813 --> 01:20:31.745
She have to see any of that?

01:20:31.747 --> 01:20:34.684
She's the one that called it
in.

01:20:35.685 --> 01:20:37.251
You did great, honey.

01:20:37.253 --> 01:20:39.487
You did great, honey, you did so
good.

01:20:40.490 --> 01:20:41.356
Go with Uncle Nate.

01:20:41.358 --> 01:20:42.757
You gotta go with Uncle Nate,
honey.

01:20:42.759 --> 01:20:44.860
I'm sorry, but you coulda called
me.

01:20:44.862 --> 01:20:45.861
You coulda called me, honey.

01:20:45.863 --> 01:20:48.629
It's OK.

01:20:48.631 --> 01:20:50.768
Why didn't she call me?

01:21:47.024 --> 01:21:48.024
Yeah.

01:21:50.560 --> 01:21:51.560
Sad.

01:21:59.036 --> 01:22:01.971
I will never forgive you for
this.

01:22:09.813 --> 01:22:13.147
I've hated your for a long time,

01:22:13.149 --> 01:22:15.752
but it was nothin' like this.

01:22:24.060 --> 01:22:26.596
You were a wonderful mother,

01:22:27.663 --> 01:22:29.867
and you were so beautiful,

01:22:31.167 --> 01:22:34.572
and you let everything get in
the way.

01:22:38.175 --> 01:22:39.175
So...

01:22:41.345 --> 01:22:43.881
This is from me and Crystal.

01:22:52.055 --> 01:22:55.255
And this is from Crystal's
future husband and my mom.

01:23:08.305 --> 01:23:09.306
You good?

01:23:10.640 --> 01:23:12.240
I'm good.

01:23:12.242 --> 01:23:14.075
She's in the bus right now
with Sharon.

01:23:14.077 --> 01:23:15.143
I got someone headed to pick up
your car.

01:23:15.145 --> 01:23:16.945
You got keys?

01:23:16.947 --> 01:23:17.948
Uh, here.

01:23:19.282 --> 01:23:20.281
Captain's on the phone right
now

01:23:20.283 --> 01:23:21.982
with CPS about your character.

01:23:21.984 --> 01:23:23.017
I think you got her.

01:23:23.019 --> 01:23:24.819
They're calling it
non-pursuable jurisdiction.

01:23:25.287 --> 01:23:27.088
Oh, we've got people lookin' for
Chris.

01:23:27.090 --> 01:23:29.190
Yeah, find him; you don't want
me to.

01:23:44.140 --> 01:23:45.440
It's fine, it's fine.

01:23:45.442 --> 01:23:47.176
It's fine, it's OK.

01:23:48.679 --> 01:23:50.948
It's just the neighborhood.

01:24:02.158 --> 01:24:03.292
Hey, honey.

01:24:06.128 --> 01:24:08.996
Yeah, come over here, it's fine.

01:24:08.998 --> 01:24:09.830
It's fine, honey.

01:24:09.832 --> 01:24:11.331
She wouldn't wake
up.

01:24:11.333 --> 01:24:16.036
I know, honey, I'm so
sorry.

01:24:16.038 --> 01:24:17.071
Let me talk to you for a second.

01:24:17.073 --> 01:24:18.238
I gotta talk to you about
somethin' important.

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:20.911
You gotta listen for a second.

01:24:23.345 --> 01:24:25.312
Did Mom ever talk to you about
Grandma?

01:24:25.314 --> 01:24:27.115
No.

01:24:27.117 --> 01:24:28.117
Yeah.

01:24:30.052 --> 01:24:31.486
Well, look.

01:24:31.488 --> 01:24:34.057
Just because somebody leaves,

01:24:38.862 --> 01:24:42.897
just because somebody chooses to
leave,

01:24:42.899 --> 01:24:46.468
that doesn't mean they didn't
wanna be here with you.

01:24:46.470 --> 01:24:49.470
It means they had a hard time of
things.

01:24:49.472 --> 01:24:51.408
A lot for some people.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:55.045
That's not gonna be us.

01:24:55.979 --> 01:24:59.848
And you and I are gonna have
a hard time for a long while.

01:24:59.850 --> 01:25:02.983
Might even have to go
and talk to some people,

01:25:02.985 --> 01:25:06.521
but before you know it, everything
will be back to normal.

01:25:06.523 --> 01:25:10.993
And I'm gonna be the best
dad ever, you understand?

01:25:13.395 --> 01:25:15.865
I gotta get you out a here.

01:25:16.899 --> 01:25:19.235
It's a dead end living here.

01:25:20.237 --> 01:25:21.835
Move to a city.

01:25:21.837 --> 01:25:25.839
Pack up the house and go
tonight if we have to.

01:25:25.841 --> 01:25:29.378
Oh God, it's the song.

01:25:38.421 --> 01:25:39.553
Sorry, honey.

01:25:39.555 --> 01:25:41.955
Daddy's realizing he's had
this conversation before.

01:25:41.957 --> 01:25:43.826
I was about your age.

01:25:44.560 --> 01:25:46.162
How'd she say it?

01:25:51.501 --> 01:25:54.169
I can't make you leave.

01:25:54.171 --> 01:25:57.205
You gotta want more for
yourself.

01:25:57.207 --> 01:25:58.473
I can't promise you

01:25:58.475 --> 01:26:02.212
it's not gonna get much
better living here.

01:26:03.512 --> 01:26:05.047
What do you say?

01:26:06.283 --> 01:26:09.483
You wanna hop in the car with
me?

01:26:09.485 --> 01:26:11.954
You wanna runaway together?

01:26:14.990 --> 01:26:17.458
Yeah.

01:26:17.460 --> 01:26:18.492
Yeah?

01:26:18.494 --> 01:26:19.496
Yeah, OK.

01:26:21.931 --> 01:26:23.000
All right.

01:26:24.600 --> 01:26:26.601
All right, I'm gonna take you
home.

01:26:26.603 --> 01:26:28.169
Actually, I can't take you home.

01:26:28.171 --> 01:26:29.937
Hold on, wait for a second.

01:26:29.939 --> 01:26:31.138
Hey, Nate! My house.

01:26:31.140 --> 01:26:32.406
Yeah, what?

01:26:32.408 --> 01:26:34.010
My house.

01:26:35.478 --> 01:26:37.512
Yeah, yeah, I'm on it.

01:26:37.514 --> 01:26:39.115
I'm... I'm on it.

01:26:57.132 --> 01:26:58.866
This is gonna be so lame.

01:26:58.868 --> 01:27:00.268
No it's not, honey, you're
gonna love it.

01:27:00.270 --> 01:27:01.635
Put your shawl on.

01:27:01.637 --> 01:27:03.303
Why do I have to wear a shawl?

01:27:03.305 --> 01:27:05.540
'Cause that's what girls do
when they go to the ballet.

01:27:05.542 --> 01:27:08.242
Don't complain; stop
being a little Grinch.

01:27:08.244 --> 01:27:09.177
Gimme that.

01:27:09.179 --> 01:27:10.279
Oh, my god!

01:30:04.984 --> 01:30:09.984
