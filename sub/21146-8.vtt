WEBVTT

00:46.131 --> 00:47.590
Get out of the way.

00:56.099 --> 00:57.434
Can't believe it's you.

01:03.356 --> 01:04.899
I'd rather eat a skunk's balls.

01:05.817 --> 01:07.360
I'll save it for later.

01:50.028 --> 01:52.405
Thank you. That was nice of you.

01:54.115 --> 01:55.617
No, it wasn't. No, no.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.910
Take him to the hole.

01:57.160 --> 01:59.954
No, no, no, no, no. Please, please.
I was being selfish. Okay?

02:00.038 --> 02:01.331
Look, I didn't want to trip on it.

02:01.414 --> 02:02.957
Please. I wasn't being nice.

02:03.041 --> 02:06.336
Please. Anything. Anything but the hole!

02:06.419 --> 02:07.921
I don't want to go to the hole!

02:10.173 --> 02:11.758
- You're welcome.
- Bummer, man!

02:14.677 --> 02:16.721
- What are we supposed to eat now?
- That bitch!

02:20.266 --> 02:21.267
Tell her this isn't right.

02:24.229 --> 02:25.230
What did we do?

02:26.689 --> 02:28.858
Quiet! Shut up and let me think!

02:31.569 --> 02:33.154
I said, "Shut up!"

02:34.614 --> 02:35.698
Hold him down.

02:42.205 --> 02:44.707
Let's show him
how much that fire can really burn.

02:49.254 --> 02:51.256
Next time I tell you to shut up,

02:52.257 --> 02:53.341
shut up!

02:56.010 --> 02:57.470
Hope nobody has to shit.

03:38.052 --> 03:39.137
What are you looking at?

04:54.003 --> 04:56.214
You're a chubby little bugger, aren't you?

04:59.592 --> 05:04.389
<i>Way down in Tipperary
where cow plop is thick</i>

05:05.139 --> 05:08.935
<i>Where women are young
and the lads all come quick</i>

05:11.062 --> 05:14.732
<i>There lived pretty Charlotte
the girl we adore</i>

05:16.734 --> 05:19.237
<i>The pride of dear Erin</i>

05:20.446 --> 05:22.573
<i>The scarlet-haired whore</i>

05:23.783 --> 05:27.370
<i>It's Scarlet the harlot
the girl we adore</i>

05:29.288 --> 05:31.416
<i>The pride of dear Erin</i>

05:33.001 --> 05:35.086
<i>The scarlet-haired whore</i>

05:39.257 --> 05:40.675
Don't you worry, <i>a mhac.</i>

05:42.635 --> 05:45.013
I'm gonna be the best da you ever seen.

06:41.069 --> 06:42.987
Can I get you anything?

06:43.154 --> 06:44.989
<i>Puis-je vous offrir
quelque chose?</i>

06:48.326 --> 06:50.328
No. I won't do it.

07:07.845 --> 07:09.680
Still with the nightmares, then?

07:12.016 --> 07:13.643
Fridge is busted.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.856
You know, me brother
used to get night terrors.

07:18.940 --> 07:21.734
Me ma'd fix him
something called a Celtic Sandman.

07:23.194 --> 07:28.241
Dram of whisky, dram of honey,
and just a pellet or two of rat poison.

07:28.324 --> 07:31.494
Couple of swigs of that,
you'll sleep so hard, you won't even dream.

07:33.412 --> 07:35.206
Hey, you wanna go out?

07:35.873 --> 07:36.916
Out where?

07:39.377 --> 07:43.965
I don't know. Out, you know.
Have fun, get in trouble.

07:44.048 --> 07:46.676
Maybe go back to that Hurt Locker place.

07:46.759 --> 07:48.553
I should stay here with Denis.

07:50.805 --> 07:52.390
What about Jesse?

07:55.184 --> 07:56.394
Nah.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.189
He's got his God thing going on.

08:01.566 --> 08:03.568
Needs his rest.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.653
It's already 2:30 in the morning.

08:05.736 --> 08:08.406
I think you do too, love. No?

08:10.908 --> 08:12.118
Yeah. No.

08:13.035 --> 08:15.329
Bad idea. You're right.
Mmm-mmm.

08:16.664 --> 08:18.624
- I'm going to bed.
- All right.

08:19.250 --> 08:21.085
- Night, Cass.
- Night, love.

08:34.807 --> 08:35.933
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:37.643 --> 08:38.811
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:39.103 --> 08:41.022
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:42.356 --> 08:43.566
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:45.276 --> 08:46.986
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:47.069 --> 08:49.739
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:49.947 --> 08:51.240
<i>Mords-moi!</i>

08:52.200 --> 08:53.201
<i>Mords-moi.</i>

08:53.367 --> 08:56.078
- What is it? What's the matter?
<i>- Mords-moi. Mords-moi!</i>

08:56.162 --> 08:58.998
- All right. All right, all right. Calm down.
<i>- Mords-moi.</i>

08:59.081 --> 09:01.792
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

09:03.961 --> 09:06.672
<i>Bite me. Bite me.</i>

09:07.298 --> 09:11.427
<i>Bite me. Bite me. Bite me.</i>

09:11.510 --> 09:13.971
<i>Bite me. Bite me.</i>

09:51.842 --> 09:56.097
Hey. I'm so glad I got the landlord
to let us use the back staircase.

09:56.514 --> 09:57.890
Super handy.

10:00.268 --> 10:02.228
Yeah. Two sugars. Like you like.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.024
So, this is worth all the risk, huh?

10:07.692 --> 10:11.445
The best way to know your target
is through concealed intimacy.

10:11.529 --> 10:12.780
It's in the handbook.

10:12.863 --> 10:14.407
So, when does the big boss man get here?

10:14.490 --> 10:17.702
- "Boss man"?
- Yeah. <i>Herr</i> Starr.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.120
He's on his way.

10:20.663 --> 10:21.872
What is that?

10:22.581 --> 10:25.418
Boo Berry. Want some?

10:26.544 --> 10:28.170
Those are why you look like that.

10:44.228 --> 10:45.604
How's it goin'?

10:48.065 --> 10:49.442
Bit of a rough night.

10:49.859 --> 10:53.321
Doctor said there's no use to the hospital,
just give him a sedative,

10:53.404 --> 10:56.073
and told me to just be here
for him, you know?

10:58.993 --> 11:00.578
Anything I can do?

11:01.579 --> 11:03.414
Nah, we're good, ta.

11:03.497 --> 11:05.082
You headed out?

11:05.791 --> 11:07.752
Yeah, I thought I'd go to Circuit Works.

11:08.169 --> 11:11.339
Right. Okay. Fun.

11:11.422 --> 11:14.008
I'm takin' the God audition.
It's your idea, right?

11:14.759 --> 11:19.180
See if they can enhance the video,
blow up the image?

11:19.805 --> 11:21.557
Yeah. Right, right.

11:24.268 --> 11:26.937
Look for serial numbers
on the barrel of the gun.

11:27.229 --> 11:30.358
- See if they can trace the...
- Back to the owner. Yeah.

11:30.441 --> 11:33.527
Like they do in the shows. Makes sense.

11:37.823 --> 11:39.617
That's my only lead.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.079
It's all I got.

11:43.162 --> 11:46.457
Well, it's a good idea.
I'm glad I thought of it.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.585
Tell me how you get on, all right?

11:49.668 --> 11:50.711
All right.

11:55.633 --> 11:56.717
Padre?

12:01.347 --> 12:03.974
You know, you were asking if there
was anything you could do to help?

12:04.058 --> 12:07.395
- With Denis?
- You want me to pray for him?

12:07.478 --> 12:08.938
No. Christ, no.

12:11.148 --> 12:14.485
I'm sure, if it'd help, like.
But that's not what I was thinking.

12:14.902 --> 12:15.903
What?

12:18.864 --> 12:21.492
Look, I don't know if it's possible,
or even doable,

12:21.575 --> 12:22.743
or how your power works there

12:22.827 --> 12:24.286
in terms of guidelines and parameters,

12:24.370 --> 12:27.081
what the bloody rules are per se, but...

12:30.084 --> 12:32.336
Padre, he's dying, all right?

12:33.170 --> 12:35.005
- Maybe you could just...
- Jesus, Cass.

12:36.632 --> 12:38.759
I mean...

12:38.843 --> 12:40.886
I'm not sure Genesis could help,

12:42.221 --> 12:43.681
but even if it could,

12:45.683 --> 12:47.101
I just...

12:49.562 --> 12:52.064
I don't think that's what it's for.

12:54.191 --> 12:55.651
All right. Of course.

12:56.110 --> 12:57.695
Probably not.

12:58.195 --> 12:59.864
- You understand?
- Yeah.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.077
All right.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.710
- Hey.
- Hey.

13:12.918 --> 13:14.003
Where were you?

13:14.712 --> 13:16.630
Hurt Locker.

13:16.714 --> 13:20.301
What is it with you and that place?
I don't get it.

13:20.384 --> 13:21.886
Obviously.

13:24.138 --> 13:25.181
You okay?

13:29.894 --> 13:31.061
Yeah.

13:34.732 --> 13:37.860
All right. Good.

13:40.905 --> 13:42.198
I'm going to Circuit Works.

13:43.908 --> 13:44.950
Why?

13:46.952 --> 13:48.370
Show them the God audition.

13:49.205 --> 13:51.665
See if they can blow up an image of the gun.

13:51.874 --> 13:53.167
You know?

13:54.418 --> 13:56.086
Trace the shooter.

14:00.466 --> 14:02.176
It was Cassidy's idea.

14:07.431 --> 14:08.599
Can I come?

14:13.187 --> 14:14.396
Sure.

14:21.862 --> 14:23.447
Okay. Next.

14:25.032 --> 14:26.700
So, I have this video, it's unclear.

14:27.076 --> 14:29.703
And I heard from a friend
that you could improve the picture.

14:31.288 --> 14:33.874
- Like they do in the shows.
- "The shows"?

14:34.833 --> 14:36.460
Yeah, you know, like, the cop shows.

14:37.461 --> 14:39.880
When they blow up an image
and see a license plate,

14:39.964 --> 14:43.133
or a blurry sign, serial numbers on a gun.

14:46.554 --> 14:49.932
And, uh, what are you
looking for?

14:50.015 --> 14:51.642
Serial numbers on a gun.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.478
We'll take a look. Give us a minute.

14:55.938 --> 14:57.565
You should know

14:58.315 --> 15:01.318
there are things on here that, out of context,

15:02.236 --> 15:03.821
might seem confusing.

15:03.904 --> 15:06.740
This is New Orleans. We've seen it all before.

15:06.824 --> 15:08.617
And worse.

15:10.369 --> 15:13.497
I just wanna know
if you can see the serial numbers.

15:14.164 --> 15:16.625
Right. Give us a minute.

15:22.339 --> 15:25.259
It's got an auto-defrost. Ice maker right here.

15:25.759 --> 15:28.262
Each one of these shelves
can hold a gallon of liquid.

15:28.345 --> 15:29.513
Can I get it today?

15:29.597 --> 15:31.348
What are you doing?

15:31.432 --> 15:32.891
Oh, we needed a fridge.

15:32.975 --> 15:35.019
I can send an order in 20 minutes.

15:35.102 --> 15:37.021
- Great.
- Great.

15:37.521 --> 15:38.522
Let's go.

15:39.023 --> 15:40.691
I'm still waiting on the Dork dudes.

15:43.068 --> 15:44.570
- The what?
- The serial numbers?

15:45.195 --> 15:47.156
The reason we came here, remember?

15:49.158 --> 15:50.826
Oh. Right. Yeah.

15:51.702 --> 15:52.745
You need me for that?

16:00.002 --> 16:02.338
This is how good behavior will be dealt with.

16:04.048 --> 16:06.216
In other news, my team and I

16:06.300 --> 16:08.927
have discovered the source
of our technical difficulties,

16:09.011 --> 16:12.139
so, we should have you back
in your individual Hell cells

16:12.222 --> 16:13.390
in short order.

16:13.724 --> 16:15.100
- Man.
- Jesus.

16:15.768 --> 16:17.936
Yes. I'm excited, too.

16:19.063 --> 16:24.234
Your cells, for those of you that don't know,
are powered by a central generator.

16:24.318 --> 16:28.697
From this generator, each block
draws its allowance of power.

16:28.906 --> 16:34.078
An allowance, a very specific
allowance, based on personnel.

16:34.745 --> 16:35.788
Based on you.

16:37.247 --> 16:38.415
But problems can occur.

16:38.499 --> 16:40.793
Problems like the ones
we've been experiencing,

16:40.876 --> 16:43.420
when there are more yous
than there should be,

16:43.796 --> 16:47.049
when one of the yous
isn't supposed to be here.

16:48.258 --> 16:50.552
My question is, who?

16:52.137 --> 16:56.100
Don't be afraid. The sooner I know,
the sooner I can get you out of here.

16:57.309 --> 16:58.602
Who is it, then?

17:00.437 --> 17:02.022
Who doesn't belong in Hell?

17:03.691 --> 17:04.775
Going once...

17:07.152 --> 17:08.946
Going twice...

17:14.284 --> 17:15.327
No, over here. It's me.

17:15.411 --> 17:17.121
- It's me.
- No, I raised my hand first.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.455
- No, over here!
- It's me!

17:18.622 --> 17:19.832
- No!
- I don't belong here.

17:19.915 --> 17:20.916
Put your hands down.

17:23.168 --> 17:25.587
All right. We'll do it that way.

17:26.797 --> 17:29.299
Don't worry. Whoever you are,

17:30.008 --> 17:31.427
we'll find you.

17:39.143 --> 17:42.062
It's me. I know it is.

17:42.146 --> 17:45.023
Single mother. Three kids.

17:45.107 --> 17:49.194
I gave them everything. Cooking, cleaning.

17:49.278 --> 17:53.407
And they weren't easy, those kids.
I was at the end of my rope.

17:54.408 --> 17:57.661
- And then you set them on fire.
- Because it was never enough!

17:58.662 --> 18:01.039
Okay, well,
I'm the one who doesn't belong here

18:01.123 --> 18:02.458
'cause I didn't kill anybody.

18:03.208 --> 18:06.545
- You raped four women.
- It was date rape. There's a difference.

18:07.045 --> 18:08.088
"No" means "No."

18:08.172 --> 18:10.841
Well, they said "yes" to the date, didn't they?

18:11.675 --> 18:12.926
Ask my dad's lawyer.

18:13.010 --> 18:14.094
That's implied consent.

18:15.387 --> 18:16.388
I think I should go.

18:16.472 --> 18:18.557
The things I did? I did them for public good.

18:18.640 --> 18:20.893
It's you, isn't it?

18:22.644 --> 18:24.104
You don't belong.

18:25.856 --> 18:27.816
I'm probably the evilest person in here.

18:30.611 --> 18:31.695
Other than you.

18:34.448 --> 18:35.908
Is that so?

18:38.494 --> 18:40.829
And what did you do?

18:45.459 --> 18:46.960
None of your business.

18:51.340 --> 18:53.675
You know my crimes, Eugene.

18:55.344 --> 19:00.933
Why don't you tell me about yours,
from one evil person to another?

19:04.561 --> 19:05.687
It's a girl.

19:06.855 --> 19:08.023
She trusted me.

19:10.484 --> 19:11.485
I took advantage.

19:14.571 --> 19:15.906
You

19:17.407 --> 19:18.575
defiled her?

19:22.162 --> 19:23.247
Maimed her?

19:25.207 --> 19:26.542
Murdered?

19:27.584 --> 19:28.585
I kissed her.

19:30.420 --> 19:32.798
You don't belong here, my friend.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.593
I don't deserve to get out.

19:39.638 --> 19:41.223
Don't be fooled.

19:42.516 --> 19:45.143
Mannering's not letting anybody get out.

19:48.105 --> 19:51.775
When I first came here,
they had high hopes for me.

19:51.859 --> 19:55.863
They made me a custodian.
I had free run of the place.

19:56.572 --> 20:00.284
I saw things. I learnt how they think.

20:01.410 --> 20:03.787
Someone gets out of Hell
to tell the tale? Never.

20:07.541 --> 20:08.959
I'll just tell them it's me.

20:09.293 --> 20:10.335
Listen to me, Eugene.

20:11.295 --> 20:14.548
Hell is more than Zagnuts
and flat basketballs.

20:16.383 --> 20:18.260
There are other places they can put you.

20:21.096 --> 20:22.890
If I deserve something else...

20:24.641 --> 20:25.726
...so be it.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.776
No, no, no, no, no.

20:34.860 --> 20:36.862
That was nice of you, Eugene.

21:13.023 --> 21:14.191
All right?

21:14.816 --> 21:17.486
It's all right. It's all right. It's all right. Oh...

21:17.569 --> 21:21.949
It's all right there. Get it out. That's it.
Good boy. That's it, that's it.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.911
All right. All right. Lie down. Lie back.
Come on now. Lie back.

21:27.079 --> 21:30.290
Yes, that's it. It's all right.

21:49.601 --> 21:50.602
Nice fridge.

21:57.317 --> 21:58.652
Hey, Tule.

21:59.569 --> 22:00.779
Can I ask you a question?

22:01.196 --> 22:02.239
Yep.

22:02.364 --> 22:03.490
Do you ever think,

22:05.325 --> 22:06.910
you know, maybe...

22:08.036 --> 22:09.454
Maybe you'd wanna be me?

22:10.414 --> 22:12.165
- Nope.
- Not me, exactly.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.334
Christ, I barely want that.

22:15.085 --> 22:17.129
I mean, the other part.
You know, like, what I am.

22:17.671 --> 22:20.007
What? The vampire part?

22:20.090 --> 22:23.301
The "not dying" part.
If you could have that, would you want it?

22:25.762 --> 22:26.763
Uh...

22:28.223 --> 22:31.643
Live forever, huh? I guess it'd be cool.

22:32.436 --> 22:35.689
You don't have to worry,
'cause nothing hurts you, you know?

22:35.772 --> 22:40.068
- There's nothing to be afraid of.
- Yeah, well, things still hurt.

22:40.902 --> 22:42.404
You know what I mean.

22:43.613 --> 22:45.824
You got all your fingers chopped off.

22:45.907 --> 22:48.493
A couple of these bad boys later,
and they're back.

22:48.577 --> 22:50.579
Yeah. Well, all right. Yeah. That's a point.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.997
To be sure, that's a bonus, all right.

22:52.080 --> 22:53.957
But there's trade-offs like...

22:55.792 --> 22:58.045
I used to love the beach.

22:58.128 --> 22:59.212
When I was a boy,

22:59.296 --> 23:02.257
me ma used to take us
to the beach in the summer.

23:02.340 --> 23:04.885
Me and me brother. Every Sunday.

23:04.968 --> 23:07.220
Every other stupid git'd
be down on his knees in church.

23:07.304 --> 23:09.806
We'd have the whole run of the place.
I loved it.

23:12.059 --> 23:14.728
Christ, I can't remember
the last time I was on a beach.

23:14.811 --> 23:17.147
Yep. Me neither.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.191
I hate the beach.

23:20.692 --> 23:22.110
Then there's the boredom.

23:23.820 --> 23:25.280
You've heard every joke.

23:25.947 --> 23:27.532
Drugs barely work.

23:30.035 --> 23:32.537
And then everyone you ever cared
or loved just...

23:33.789 --> 23:35.165
Just dies.

23:38.251 --> 23:39.503
Except you.

23:48.678 --> 23:49.721
Yep, that sucks.

23:52.682 --> 23:53.683
Yeah.

24:29.719 --> 24:32.764
<i>From the ocean floor below,
to the mountain peaks above.</i>

24:32.848 --> 24:35.725
<i>From the food you eat, to the mess you make.</i>

24:35.809 --> 24:36.852
<i>We're behind it.</i>

24:37.561 --> 24:41.398
<i>Making a today great for you,
and a tomorrow great for us.</i>

24:43.024 --> 24:45.986
<i>Custer, Jesse.
The Dork Docs will see you now.</i>

24:48.363 --> 24:49.364
Dude.

24:49.447 --> 24:51.741
You did it? It worked?

24:53.118 --> 24:54.911
Enjoy the brilliance.

24:56.037 --> 24:59.457
So, we punch in nice and tight,
right there, and... Oh!

24:59.541 --> 25:01.751
What do we see there on the gun barrel?

25:03.670 --> 25:06.214
- I don't see anything.
- No, you don't.

25:09.926 --> 25:11.052
I don't see anything.

25:11.595 --> 25:13.847
- No serial numbers.
- That's right.

25:13.930 --> 25:15.599
They've been scrubbed off.

25:15.682 --> 25:19.978
There's nothing on this tape
that can identify who's holding that gun.

25:21.062 --> 25:22.898
But I wanna know who's holding that gun.

25:25.650 --> 25:27.319
Don't we know who's holding that gun?

25:28.612 --> 25:30.405
- You.
- It's not me.

25:30.488 --> 25:32.157
Why would I bring it in here if it was me?

25:32.240 --> 25:33.366
To cover your ass.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.787
I thought you were worried about
someone tracing this back to you.

25:37.871 --> 25:42.500
But, no, he was hoping
that we'd find the serial numbers.

25:42.584 --> 25:45.253
Yes, like I said before,

25:45.962 --> 25:47.672
I need to know who's behind this.

25:47.756 --> 25:49.799
Yeah, that's tough.

25:52.052 --> 25:53.929
There has to be some other way.

25:55.013 --> 25:56.306
Has to be.

25:57.224 --> 25:58.683
All right. Start it from the beginning.

26:01.853 --> 26:03.188
Stop. There.

26:03.647 --> 26:04.648
What is that?

26:05.023 --> 26:07.943
Okay, that's a slate.
When you're making a movie...

26:08.026 --> 26:09.152
In the reflection.

26:10.695 --> 26:11.988
Behind the camera.

26:13.073 --> 26:14.449
That's a face.

26:16.117 --> 26:17.202
Or a coffee pot.

26:17.911 --> 26:22.415
I don't know. I think he might be right.
The resolution's completely deteriorated.

26:22.499 --> 26:25.085
Maybe if we did a pixel recalibration.

26:25.168 --> 26:27.087
- Oh. Yeah.
- Can you do it?

26:27.671 --> 26:28.672
- Give us a minute.
- Give us a minute.

27:34.571 --> 27:35.822
What's down there?

27:35.905 --> 27:37.407
An extrapolator.

27:38.867 --> 27:39.826
A what?

27:39.909 --> 27:41.745
I told you we could make things worse.

27:41.828 --> 27:42.829
No!

28:22.786 --> 28:24.287
It's the same.

28:26.122 --> 28:27.290
You have to.

28:28.041 --> 28:30.794
You're the only one
I can count on to do what I say.

28:35.131 --> 28:36.257
Look, Tracy.

28:37.217 --> 28:40.720
It's like what Mary Poppins
says in <i>The Sound of Music,</i>

28:42.889 --> 28:45.266
"When God closes a door,
He always opens up a window."

28:48.019 --> 28:49.312
You're right.

28:51.231 --> 28:53.233
I used to love Mary Poppins.

29:11.167 --> 29:12.669
Thanks, Eugene.

29:27.142 --> 29:28.184
What the heck?

29:29.686 --> 29:32.897
- I'm sorry. I just thought that...
- You like me?

29:38.111 --> 29:39.112
Yeah.

29:41.698 --> 29:42.782
Wait.

29:44.784 --> 29:45.994
You're not mad?

29:46.786 --> 29:49.831
Yes, I'm mad.
Mad that you didn't say anything!

29:50.290 --> 29:52.876
- What?
- I like you, too.

30:01.718 --> 30:04.262
- I feel like singing.
- Me, too.

30:10.310 --> 30:11.895
<i>Closing time</i>

30:13.062 --> 30:18.401
<i>One last call for alcohol
so finish your whisky or beer</i>

30:20.069 --> 30:22.071
<i>Closing time</i>

30:22.697 --> 30:28.411
<i>You don't have to go home
but you can't stay here</i>

30:29.496 --> 30:33.249
<i>I know who I want to take me home</i>

30:34.083 --> 30:38.004
<i>I know who I want to take me home</i>

30:39.130 --> 30:43.092
<i>I know who I want to take me home</i>

30:44.427 --> 30:48.389
<i>Take me home</i>

30:50.016 --> 30:53.603
- Why are you crying now?
- I'm just...

30:56.606 --> 30:57.690
Happy.

31:03.780 --> 31:04.781
Oh...

31:05.865 --> 31:07.116
Is someone in there?

31:08.076 --> 31:10.203
I wish you'd told me
how you felt sooner, Eugene.

31:10.286 --> 31:13.414
I kind of already promised myself
to someone else.

31:15.833 --> 31:16.960
What?

31:18.294 --> 31:19.295
Who?

31:21.214 --> 31:22.215
God.

31:26.469 --> 31:29.097
Eugene. I didn't know you were here.

31:29.764 --> 31:30.765
Preacher?

31:31.224 --> 31:32.725
How you doing?

31:32.809 --> 31:35.603
Tracy tells me you got a big
chemistry test coming up this week.

31:37.063 --> 31:38.147
You gonna be ready?

31:38.815 --> 31:40.066
Yeah. I think so.

31:40.650 --> 31:43.152
Good. That goes for you, too, Tracy.

31:43.653 --> 31:45.405
The more effort you guys put in now,

31:45.488 --> 31:47.824
the more options you're gonna have
later on in life.

31:48.324 --> 31:51.452
I do most of my homework
on the bus on the way home from school.

31:51.536 --> 31:52.579
'Course you do.

31:55.290 --> 31:56.332
Tracy.

32:00.128 --> 32:01.421
Preacher's not God.

32:03.256 --> 32:04.424
He is to me.

32:13.308 --> 32:14.309
No.

32:15.810 --> 32:17.103
No, guys...

32:19.230 --> 32:21.190
Cut it out! Guys!

32:21.858 --> 32:22.900
Cut it out!

32:26.696 --> 32:27.697
No!

32:29.032 --> 32:30.366
No, I said stop!

32:33.536 --> 32:35.288
Stop!

32:43.338 --> 32:46.716
Eugene? I called your father!
He's gonna be very upset with you!

32:46.883 --> 32:48.718
Finish the job.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.345
Eugene!

32:50.511 --> 32:53.222
Go on, Eugene. Finish the job.

32:55.266 --> 32:56.267
Uh-huh.

32:57.810 --> 32:59.020
That's right.

32:59.228 --> 33:02.273
Ah. Yeah.
Oh, that's right.

33:02.357 --> 33:03.316
Go on.

33:03.399 --> 33:05.777
I told you I was gonna come for you, Eugene.

33:06.027 --> 33:09.530
And I'm coming right now!

33:18.581 --> 33:19.624
All right.

33:20.792 --> 33:24.003
All right, here we go. Bit of ginger ale.

33:27.548 --> 33:29.133
Whoa. Oh, dear God.

33:29.759 --> 33:31.219
Poor fella. Come here.

33:31.302 --> 33:32.637
All right, mate.

33:34.806 --> 33:36.516
You all right?

33:36.599 --> 33:38.142
Come on, let's get that out the way.
Come on, mate.

33:39.560 --> 33:42.772
Hard to recuperate when you're
inhaling the smell of your own sick.

33:43.398 --> 33:44.440
My God.

33:44.774 --> 33:46.984
All right, let me get that for you.

33:50.029 --> 33:51.114
Papa.

33:53.825 --> 33:56.494
Papa, please.

34:28.443 --> 34:29.902
Are you okay?

34:36.534 --> 34:38.828
You had to see for yourself.

34:39.996 --> 34:41.539
You had to see.

34:43.291 --> 34:45.418
Once they find out you are the mistake,

34:45.501 --> 34:47.628
that is where they will put you.

34:48.588 --> 34:51.424
And not just for an hour or two.

34:51.507 --> 34:53.009
But forever.

34:56.512 --> 34:59.515
I know. It's not fair.

35:00.850 --> 35:02.185
Please give me a break.

35:03.519 --> 35:05.605
What do you care about fair?

35:05.772 --> 35:08.691
You have to trust me, Eugene.

35:10.193 --> 35:11.736
I want to help you.

35:13.780 --> 35:14.864
Help me?

35:16.532 --> 35:17.658
Help me what?

35:18.701 --> 35:21.078
To escape, of course.

36:07.708 --> 36:09.252
Who is it?

36:10.586 --> 36:11.879
Um... Your neighbor.

36:22.348 --> 36:23.349
Who's out there with you?

36:25.685 --> 36:27.520
Nobody. It's just me.

36:28.604 --> 36:29.605
Is...

36:30.022 --> 36:31.399
What do you want?

36:31.983 --> 36:32.984
Um...

36:33.568 --> 36:37.613
I'm just going round all the apartments
and fixing up the holes.

36:38.322 --> 36:39.615
If you want.

36:46.497 --> 36:48.291
I thought you were my ex.

36:49.917 --> 36:51.419
Come, come on in.

36:59.010 --> 37:00.094
God.

37:03.306 --> 37:06.642
I don't know why I'm praying
when I know you're not there,

37:10.313 --> 37:12.440
but if this is your plan for me

37:14.734 --> 37:16.485
and you can hear me,

37:18.988 --> 37:20.990
I'm asking for your help.

37:24.410 --> 37:27.330
I gave up a piece of my soul to find you.

37:29.957 --> 37:31.751
Don't let it be for nothing.

37:33.836 --> 37:35.463
Please.

37:36.088 --> 37:38.841
<i>Custer, Jesse. Please come to the Dork Docs.</i>

37:45.056 --> 37:46.182
Any luck?

37:46.557 --> 37:48.351
Sorry, man. We've got nothing.

37:50.937 --> 37:51.938
What?

37:52.021 --> 37:54.106
We enlarged the image,

37:54.190 --> 37:57.443
ran it through this pixel manipulator, but...

37:57.693 --> 37:59.612
He's right. It was a coffee pot.

38:00.029 --> 38:01.822
I guess maybe they had coffee
before they killed him.

38:02.490 --> 38:03.991
Or after they killed him.

38:04.367 --> 38:05.660
- Right.
- Yeah.

38:07.954 --> 38:09.038
Nothin'.

38:12.124 --> 38:15.544
All this for nothin'.

38:19.215 --> 38:20.758
Is there anything else
we can help you with, sir?

38:20.841 --> 38:23.094
Yeah, I'm looking for God! You seen him?

38:23.177 --> 38:24.679
You got him back there?

38:32.144 --> 38:33.270
I'm sorry.

38:34.522 --> 38:35.856
Oh. Hey, your DVD.

38:36.273 --> 38:38.734
Like you said, there's nothing on it.

38:51.914 --> 38:56.669
I was gonna do that sooner or later,
but thank you.

38:57.920 --> 39:00.089
You know,
I heard the shooting was pretty bad.

39:00.923 --> 39:04.218
Yeah. It was.

39:07.013 --> 39:08.097
That why you got a gun?

39:10.766 --> 39:11.809
Oh.

39:11.892 --> 39:15.438
No. That's, um...
For my ex.

39:18.441 --> 39:22.611
Rodney can be unpredictable.

39:25.614 --> 39:27.283
Where's all your furniture?

39:27.992 --> 39:29.035
Mmm.

39:29.118 --> 39:33.289
I just got here,
so I had to leave kind of quick.

39:34.623 --> 39:38.210
So, for now, it's just table, chairs,
and an air mattress.

39:38.294 --> 39:39.670
And a TV.

39:40.129 --> 39:41.130
Oh.

39:41.255 --> 39:43.049
Right. Creature comforts.

39:44.008 --> 39:45.134
Yeah.

39:47.344 --> 39:48.387
Boo Berry.

39:50.139 --> 39:51.182
Oh.

39:51.265 --> 39:53.726
Yeah, my favorite.

39:54.852 --> 39:55.936
Me, too.

39:56.896 --> 39:58.314
Count Chocula can suck it.

40:01.942 --> 40:03.110
I'm Tulip.

40:03.736 --> 40:04.737
Um...

40:05.029 --> 40:06.113
Jenny.

40:08.157 --> 40:09.450
Yeah, so...

40:09.533 --> 40:12.953
You can let it set an hour, maybe.

40:13.871 --> 40:16.332
Then you can sand, paint, whatever.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.001
Thanks, again.

40:24.131 --> 40:25.132
Mmm.

40:27.968 --> 40:30.971
You ever put on a bullet-proof vest
and get shot in the chest?

40:32.348 --> 40:35.351
I can't say that I have.

40:36.018 --> 40:37.019
Hmm.

40:38.729 --> 40:40.189
But it sounds fun.

40:42.441 --> 40:43.442
It is.

40:46.695 --> 40:47.822
We should go sometime.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.199
I'd like that.

41:04.130 --> 41:05.297
<i>What?</i>

41:05.381 --> 41:06.799
Hey, it's Proinsias.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.551
<i>What do you want? Money?</i>

41:09.718 --> 41:11.345
It's good to hear your voice, Seamus.

41:11.428 --> 41:14.598
<i>I have no patience for your dancing
about. How much this time?</i>

41:14.682 --> 41:16.559
No, I'm not looking for your handouts.

41:17.143 --> 41:19.061
<i>No? Then what?</i>

41:21.063 --> 41:22.356
I have a son.

41:22.439 --> 41:26.026
<i>Well, I imagine you have dozens,
but congratulations.</i>

41:26.110 --> 41:27.820
No, look, it's not like that.

41:28.821 --> 41:31.991
Look, Denis is not new, all right? He's old.

41:33.200 --> 41:34.535
And he's sick.

41:38.164 --> 41:39.832
<i>How well do you know him?</i>

41:41.667 --> 41:43.419
I just told you he's me son, didn't I?

41:43.502 --> 41:47.339
<i>You know what I'm asking. What's he like?
What's his prevailing temperament?</i>

41:47.423 --> 41:49.008
<i>How well do you know him, Proinsias?</i>

41:49.091 --> 41:52.428
I know that he's dyin', Seamus, all right?

41:53.304 --> 41:54.597
I know that much.

41:55.723 --> 41:59.602
<i>Don't do it. Let him die.</i>

42:16.869 --> 42:21.749
<i>Way down in Tipperary
where cow plop is thick</i>

42:25.794 --> 42:29.965
<i>Where women are young
and the lads all come quick</i>

42:32.635 --> 42:36.639
<i>There lived pretty Charlotte
the girl we adore</i>

42:38.807 --> 42:42.811
<i>The pride of dear Erin
the scarlet-haired whore</i>

42:45.814 --> 42:49.276
<i>It's Scarlet the harlot
the girl we adore</i>

42:53.447 --> 42:56.158
<i>The pride of dear Erin</i>

42:57.618 --> 42:59.828
<i>The scarlet-haired whore</i>
