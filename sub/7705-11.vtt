[instrumental music]

00:07.274 --> 00:11.377
Yo, Kate! Where do you keep
your casserole dishes?

00:11.379 --> 00:12.444
Why?

00:12.446 --> 00:13.445
The cat won't fit in

00:13.447 --> 00:14.880
the toaster.

00:16.183 --> 00:19.618
Never mind. I'll make
a peanut-butter sandwich.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.653
Where's the blender?

00:21.655 --> 00:23.722
Try it without the blender
this time.

00:23.724 --> 00:26.358
And don't get hair
in the peanut-butter jar.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.193
Rules, rules, rules.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.632
Yes, that's the answer.
San Diego.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.801
Fine. What was the question?

00:35.803 --> 00:37.703
Where should we go
on our vacation?

00:37.705 --> 00:39.171
I say we should go to San Diego.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.974
Oh, San Diego sounds fine to me.
But what about ALF?

00:41.976 --> 00:45.377
We don't have to check with ALF.
That's where we're going.

00:45.379 --> 00:47.913
San Diego really does have
something for everyone.

00:47.915 --> 00:50.149
It's not just an empty slogan.

00:50.151 --> 00:52.317
I mean, what are we
going to<i> do</i> with ALF?

00:52.319 --> 00:54.153
SeaWorld, Brian will love that.

00:54.155 --> 00:55.854
They've got..
The new killer whales are in.

00:55.856 --> 00:58.190
And look,
look at those beaches. The..

00:58.192 --> 00:59.725
Lynn'll have a great time!

00:59.727 --> 01:02.194
[clears throat]
What about ALF?

01:02.196 --> 01:03.328
I'm sorry.

01:03.330 --> 01:06.098
Did you say I<i> should</i> get hair

01:06.100 --> 01:07.399
in the peanut butter

01:07.401 --> 01:09.501
or I shouldn't?

01:09.503 --> 01:11.670
Just toss it out.

01:11.672 --> 01:13.005
The hair or the peanut butter?

01:13.007 --> 01:16.208
- Both!
- No problem!

01:16.210 --> 01:17.543
Why don't I believe that?

01:17.545 --> 01:19.711
Oh, my gosh!

01:19.713 --> 01:22.014
They're having
a Shakespeare Festival.

01:22.016 --> 01:26.385
Willie, there is hair
in our peanut butter.

01:26.387 --> 01:30.055
"Love Boat's" Bernie Kopell
is playing Hamlet.

01:30.057 --> 01:31.790
I said,
what are we gonna do about--

01:31.792 --> 01:33.625
Grease fire! Grease fire!

01:33.627 --> 01:37.196
- 'ALF!'
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

01:37.198 --> 01:39.932
(ALF)
'Never mind the curtains.
Put me out!'

[inaudible]

02:21.909 --> 02:25.077
[music continues]

02:45.032 --> 02:48.867
Thank you for this food that
you've set before us tonight.

02:48.869 --> 02:52.838
And once again, thank you
for sparing our kitchen.

02:53.641 --> 02:54.940
Amen to that.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.909
[bangs]
Let's eat!

02:58.546 --> 03:00.846
There's hair in this tuna fish.

03:03.384 --> 03:04.783
I like it.

03:05.786 --> 03:08.620
How come I didn't get any hair?

03:08.622 --> 03:10.289
We ran out.

03:10.291 --> 03:12.491
Which is<i> exactly</i>
what I'm gonna do.

03:12.493 --> 03:14.793
- May I please be excused?
- No, no, stay, Lynn.

03:14.795 --> 03:16.461
Uh that's the end
of the hair talk.

03:16.463 --> 03:18.964
I-I wanna talk about what
we're gonna do on our vacation.

03:18.966 --> 03:21.633
Why's that the end
of the hair talk?

03:21.635 --> 03:23.535
Because that's the end.
That's why.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.803
We've changed subjects.

03:24.805 --> 03:26.305
We're talking about
our vacation.

03:26.307 --> 03:29.408
I thought we decided.
San Diego.

03:29.410 --> 03:31.376
It has something for everyone.

03:31.378 --> 03:32.911
Well, your mother and I

03:32.913 --> 03:35.747
I mean, Kate and I,
have talked about this

03:35.749 --> 03:38.016
and we've decided, uh

03:38.018 --> 03:39.751
we should all stay right here.

03:39.753 --> 03:41.853
At the table?

03:41.855 --> 03:44.656
No, no, uh, but in house

03:44.658 --> 03:46.692
or-or around the house.

03:46.694 --> 03:47.826
Around the house?

03:47.828 --> 03:49.828
Well, we can go out-outside.

03:49.830 --> 03:52.097
Do we get to cross the street?

03:52.099 --> 03:55.934
We just thought instead of going
somewhere far away and different

03:55.936 --> 03:57.936
it would be more fun
to, to stay home

03:57.938 --> 04:00.239
where-where things
are, are not so different

04:00.241 --> 04:03.775
and, uh, do pretty much
the same things

04:03.777 --> 04:05.844
we do every day.

04:05.846 --> 04:08.046
I think you sold them, dear.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.515
No sale here.
I think it bites wind.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.418
- 'ALF--'
- What? That's not hair talk.

04:13.420 --> 04:17.022
Uh, we-well, let's just get back
to this vacation thing, alright?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.857
Yeah, I think
we should talk about it.

04:18.859 --> 04:20.125
How come
we're not going anywhere?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.194
Did you lose all your money?

04:22.196 --> 04:24.863
Been playing the ponies,
haven't you?

04:24.865 --> 04:26.231
If you wanna know the truth

04:26.233 --> 04:27.899
you're the reason
we're staying home.

04:27.901 --> 04:30.269
-<i> Moi? </i>
-<i> Oui, monsieur.</i>

04:30.271 --> 04:33.038
-<i> Porquoi? </i>
- Because you're an alien.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.706
- We're dropping the French?
- We're dropping it.

04:34.708 --> 04:37.042
No<i> problemo.</i>

04:37.044 --> 04:39.378
Why can't we take ALF
to San Diego?

04:39.380 --> 04:41.280
Because the minute
we check into a hotel

04:41.282 --> 04:42.714
somebody's gonna call
the police.

04:42.716 --> 04:44.783
Or "The National Enquirer."

04:46.053 --> 04:47.886
And, obviously,
we can't leave you home alone.

04:47.888 --> 04:49.388
You proved that today.

04:49.390 --> 04:53.392
I suppose that's a reference
to this kitchen thing.

04:53.394 --> 04:54.893
You did start that fire.

04:54.895 --> 04:56.795
And then you watched TV

04:56.797 --> 04:58.597
while Kate and I put it out.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.732
I didn't think
it was a three-man job.

05:00.734 --> 05:05.504
The point is we're going to have
to spend this vacation at home.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.172
I-I feel terrible.

05:07.174 --> 05:11.476
I ruined your stove,
now I'm ruining your vacation.

05:11.478 --> 05:14.646
I'm worthless. I'm garbage.

05:14.648 --> 05:16.948
I'm canal water. I bite wind.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.684
- ALF!
- What?

05:18.686 --> 05:20.519
ALF,
you haven't ruined anything.

05:20.521 --> 05:23.622
- Except our stove.
- And our vacation.

05:23.624 --> 05:25.424
Well, I can't live with that.

05:25.426 --> 05:27.926
You people are going on vacation
without me.

05:27.928 --> 05:29.428
I don't see how we can.

05:29.430 --> 05:30.762
Pen me in the yard

05:30.764 --> 05:32.931
where I won't cause any damage.

05:32.933 --> 05:36.201
Chain me to a tree.
Put me in a kennel.

05:36.203 --> 05:39.705
No, ALF! We're not going
on vacation without you.

05:39.707 --> 05:43.041
I agree. There's gotta be
some place we can all go.

05:43.043 --> 05:45.377
Before we gloss over
this kennel business--

05:45.379 --> 05:46.478
Kate!

05:46.480 --> 05:47.612
Maybe if we went

05:47.614 --> 05:48.647
deep into the woods

05:48.649 --> 05:50.949
where nobody would see ALF.

05:50.951 --> 05:54.453
Out of the mouths of babes.

05:54.455 --> 05:55.620
We can rent a motorhome.

05:55.622 --> 05:57.556
We could go
to some secluded campground.

05:57.558 --> 05:59.358
That's a great idea!

05:59.360 --> 06:02.661
Let's give it a shot!
It could be fun.

06:02.663 --> 06:06.164
Singing songs
around the campfire

06:06.166 --> 06:09.735
eating pork and beans
out of a tin can

06:09.737 --> 06:13.138
being together 24 hours a day

06:13.140 --> 06:15.474
learning to accept each other's

06:15.476 --> 06:18.510
little idiosyncrasies.

06:18.512 --> 06:19.745
So the kennel idea is dead?

06:19.747 --> 06:20.812
- 'Mom!'
- Kate!

06:20.814 --> 06:22.714
Okay, fine, we'll go camping.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.049
What do we need? Uh..

06:24.051 --> 06:26.718
We need, um, pork and beans.

06:26.720 --> 06:30.155
- Yeah.
- Uh, wolf repellant..

06:30.157 --> 06:32.023
¶ Two bottles of beer
on the wall ¶

06:32.025 --> 06:33.658
¶ Two bottles of beer ¶

06:33.660 --> 06:36.161
¶ If one of those bottles
should happen to fall ¶

06:36.163 --> 06:37.829

06:43.670 --> 06:47.706
¶ No more bottles of beer
on the wall ¶¶

06:47.708 --> 06:49.207
One more time!

06:49.209 --> 06:51.243
¶ A thousand bottles of beer
on the wall ¶

06:51.245 --> 06:52.911
¶ A thousand bottles of beer ¶¶

06:52.913 --> 06:54.546
Come on, mom, sing with us.

06:54.548 --> 06:57.015
I don't know the words.

06:57.017 --> 07:00.786
Hey, Willie, keep your eyes open
for a clean gas station.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.287
I'm gonna need to make
a pit stop.

07:02.289 --> 07:04.723
- Again?
- I can't help it.

07:04.725 --> 07:07.025
It's all this
singing about beer.

07:09.463 --> 07:12.597
Hey, Lynn, you wanna spit out
the window with me?

07:12.599 --> 07:14.966
[chuckles]
Maybe later.

07:14.968 --> 07:17.969
- I'll spot you ten feet.
- No thanks.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.939
I'm gonna write a letter
to my boyfriend.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.607
How about you, Kate?

07:23.777 --> 07:24.976
I don't know how to spit.

07:24.978 --> 07:26.378
Come on, it's easy!

07:26.380 --> 07:27.446
[expectorates]

07:27.448 --> 07:29.414
No!

07:29.416 --> 07:31.082
[gulps]
Alright!

07:31.084 --> 07:33.084
Don't get your shorts in a knot.

07:33.086 --> 07:35.720
I guess I'll just moon
some state troopers.

07:35.722 --> 07:36.721
Make way here.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.391
There'll be no mooning!

07:39.393 --> 07:42.227
Boy, you call this a vacation?

07:45.432 --> 07:48.567
Hey, chief, how about letting me
take over the controls a while?

07:48.569 --> 07:50.402
You don't know how to drive.

07:50.404 --> 07:52.170
I drove through the cosmos,
didn't I?

07:52.172 --> 07:55.907
- You crashed into our garage.
- You see any garages out there?

07:55.909 --> 07:57.275
- No. No! No, no.
- Come on!

07:57.277 --> 07:59.010
- Somebody get ALF off me!
- ALF, no, don't!

<i> Dear Lash, day number two</i>

<i> I think we're in hell.</i>
<i> Please rescue me.</i>

08:25.539 --> 08:29.441
Is it just me,
or are the walls closing in?

08:29.443 --> 08:32.844
You know, I really think
the rain is gonna stop.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.280
Yeah,
it's bound to stop sometime.

08:35.282 --> 08:38.683
You've been saying that
since we docked.

08:38.685 --> 08:40.652
Come on, let's just
make the best of it.

08:40.654 --> 08:42.988
Okay, how about a game
of Chinese checkers?

08:42.990 --> 08:44.823
I'm tired of Chinese checkers.

08:44.825 --> 08:47.559
Yeah, we're tired
of Chinese checkers.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.561
How about Scrabble?

08:49.563 --> 08:52.230
ALF ate all the vowels.

08:52.232 --> 08:56.201
I was bored!
When I'm bored, I eat vowels.

08:56.203 --> 08:58.570
Well, there's always charades.

08:58.572 --> 09:00.005
I don't like charades.

09:00.007 --> 09:02.807
I always feel like
everyone's watching me.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.576
What does everyone wanna do?

09:04.578 --> 09:07.746
That is your call. You're
the one who dragged us here.

09:07.748 --> 09:11.149
You guys really are
a bunch of negative nellies.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.684
Yeah, we're trying to make
the best

09:12.686 --> 09:14.319
of a less-than-perfect situation

09:14.321 --> 09:16.855
and try to find something
that we can all do together.

09:16.857 --> 09:18.490
May I suggest San Diego?

09:18.492 --> 09:19.824
(Willie)
'No, you may not.'

09:19.826 --> 09:21.192
Now, look, I know

09:21.194 --> 09:23.228
things haven't worked out
exactly as planned

09:23.230 --> 09:26.231
but when you have a lemon,
you make lemonade.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.567
What lemon?
What are you talking about?

09:28.569 --> 09:30.835
I'm just trying to tell you
there's more than one way

09:30.837 --> 09:32.270
to skin a cat.

09:32.272 --> 09:35.674
You've been reading
my recipe book.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.208
Alright, let's do something.

09:37.210 --> 09:39.444
Everybody in your coats
and hats, we're going on a hike.

09:39.446 --> 09:41.947
- Oh, boy! In the rain!
- That sounds like fun!

09:41.949 --> 09:44.382
That's the spirit!
Let's go, huh?

09:44.384 --> 09:46.284
Who cares
if we get a little wet..

09:46.286 --> 09:49.921
That's easy for you to say.
You're not 98% hair.

09:49.923 --> 09:53.458
Now, look here, uh,
we can sit here and complain

09:53.460 --> 09:56.294
or we can go out there
and enjoy ourselves.

09:56.296 --> 09:57.896
I'm gonna sit here and complain.

09:57.898 --> 10:00.165
Fine, we'll see you later.

10:01.134 --> 10:04.336
[thunder rumbling]

10:05.973 --> 10:07.739
[sighs]

10:07.741 --> 10:09.975
Welcome back.

10:09.977 --> 10:11.543
Chutes and ladders anyone?

10:11.545 --> 10:14.779
Well, I'm gonna set up
the barbecue. Anybody hungry?

10:14.781 --> 10:16.381
You're not going out there.

10:16.383 --> 10:17.716
Oh, I'll cook under the awning.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.720
You need some help
bobbing for firewood?

10:21.722 --> 10:24.956
One more word out of you,
and you're not eating with us.

10:24.958 --> 10:26.791
Right, let the alien starve.

10:26.793 --> 10:29.160
I think
the alien could skip a meal.

10:29.162 --> 10:32.530
It might be
a new experience for him!

10:35.402 --> 10:38.069
Uh, how would you like
your hamburger?

10:38.071 --> 10:40.639
Medium-rare. Hold the lightning!

10:41.675 --> 10:45.910
Well, how would you like
to be 50% hair?

10:45.912 --> 10:48.413
You know, you're a different
person when you're on vacation.

10:48.415 --> 10:51.416
I'm just trying
to make this vacation fun.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.151
How? By drowning us?

10:53.153 --> 10:56.087
By trying to keep
a positive attitude!

10:56.089 --> 10:57.756
You might do that yourself

10:57.758 --> 11:00.191
instead of<i> complaining </i>
all the time!

11:00.193 --> 11:01.292
Guys, please!

11:01.294 --> 11:02.594
Well, not everyone enjoys

11:02.596 --> 11:04.596
spending their vacation
in a rainforest.

11:04.598 --> 11:06.798
We're in this rainforest
because of<i> you!</i>

11:06.800 --> 11:09.434
- I vote we go home.
- Uh, you're not voting on this.

11:09.436 --> 11:12.570
Call the newspapers!
Democracy is dead!

11:13.840 --> 11:16.274
You wanna go home? Go!
No one's stopping him.

11:16.276 --> 11:17.609
- Dad!
- There's the door!

11:17.611 --> 11:19.444
- Willie!
- You want me to go, I'll go!

11:19.446 --> 11:22.747
- Fine, go!
- Fine, I'm going.

11:23.517 --> 11:25.116
ALF, don't!

11:25.118 --> 11:28.019
Sorry, Brian, I have my pride.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.422
[thunder rumbling]

11:31.191 --> 11:32.691
- ALF.
- Come on, ALF.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.159
You're not really going.

11:34.161 --> 11:37.195
I'm out of here. I'm history!

11:40.801 --> 11:42.801
I'm going to die.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.804
[thunder rumbling]

11:45.806 --> 11:48.773
[instrumental music]

11:54.014 --> 11:56.047
[birds chirping]

11:56.049 --> 11:57.882
Where could he be?

11:57.884 --> 12:00.919
- Is that him?
- No.

12:00.921 --> 12:03.621
I think that's just
a rotted tree stump.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.727
[birds chirping]

12:10.197 --> 12:11.996
One, two, three, four.

12:11.998 --> 12:13.732
Oh, no! I slipped on the chute.

12:13.734 --> 12:16.501
Well, I'll just have to start
at the beginning.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.503
Dad, how can you play
at a time like this?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.071
ALF is all alone out there.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.840
He might get caught
in a bear trap.

12:21.842 --> 12:24.776
And it will be
getting dark soon, Willie.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.847
Maybe we better call the police.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.349
No, to be a missing person,
you'd have to be missing

12:31.351 --> 12:32.917
for 24 hours..

12:33.854 --> 12:35.453
...and be a person.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.289
Shoot!

12:38.291 --> 12:40.525
Another chute!

12:40.527 --> 12:44.028
Well, it just isn't my day.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.864
It's not ALF's day, either.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.466
Yeah, we want ALF back.

12:48.468 --> 12:51.402
Ju.. Don't try to make me
feel guilty about--

12:51.404 --> 12:54.739
- Sending him out to die?
- Asking him to leave.

12:54.741 --> 12:57.142
Anyone else would have done
the same thing.

12:57.144 --> 12:58.877
- Not me.
- Not me.

12:58.879 --> 13:00.011
Not me.

13:01.715 --> 13:03.715
Alright,
where's the wolf repellent?

13:03.717 --> 13:05.750
Oh, honey!

13:05.752 --> 13:06.918
Yay, dad!

13:06.920 --> 13:09.654
Remember, dad,
it doesn't work on bears.

13:09.656 --> 13:11.122
Oh, thanks.

13:11.124 --> 13:14.425
And, honey, I want you to be
very careful out there, alright?

13:14.427 --> 13:16.628
- Give me a kiss.
- Yeah, okay.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.229
- Alright.
- Mwah. I love you, daddy.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.299
Alright. So long, son.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.502
[sighs]

13:27.073 --> 13:28.306
[door shuts]

13:29.910 --> 13:32.877
[instrumental music]

13:38.451 --> 13:41.653
[birds chirping]

13:47.093 --> 13:49.994
[door creaking]

13:49.996 --> 13:51.996
Hello?

13:51.998 --> 13:53.932
Anybody home?

13:57.103 --> 13:59.003
I'm coming in!

14:03.009 --> 14:04.909
I'm in!

14:11.451 --> 14:14.519
I'm looking through
your cabinets.

14:17.057 --> 14:18.690
[sniffing]

14:26.700 --> 14:28.066
Yikes!

14:31.905 --> 14:34.873
Oh! Oreos.

14:34.875 --> 14:36.574
My kind of people.

14:39.846 --> 14:41.880
(male #1)
'Ah, it's your fault.
Hey, look here.'

14:41.882 --> 14:45.583
'You left the door open. You
know, you really are an idiot.'

14:45.585 --> 14:49.554
I mean, I had that rabbit
right in my sights

14:49.556 --> 14:53.625
and then you scare him away
with that sound you were making.

14:55.028 --> 14:56.561
It was a rabbit call.

14:56.563 --> 14:58.730
Rabbits don't have a call.

14:58.732 --> 15:00.665
How do they get
each other's attention?

15:00.667 --> 15:03.401
- Don't talk to me.
- Rabbits have a call.

15:03.403 --> 15:08.006
If you don't believe me,
look it up.

15:08.008 --> 15:10.775
[exhales sharply]
Would you look at this?

15:10.777 --> 15:13.044
I mean, you're always
leavin' the cookies out.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.880
- We're gonna get ants!
- I didn't do that.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.181
Well, who did?

15:17.183 --> 15:20.518
Maybe some animal
got in here or somethin'.

15:20.520 --> 15:22.053
Right, some animal

15:22.055 --> 15:25.423
who just happens to be
partial to Oreos!

15:25.425 --> 15:26.925
[ALF groans]

15:28.361 --> 15:29.427
What was that?

15:29.429 --> 15:30.962
I think we have a burglar.

15:30.964 --> 15:32.196
[guns cocking]

15:32.198 --> 15:34.532
A dead burglar.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.034
Cover me.

15:41.308 --> 15:43.041
It<i> is</i> an animal.

15:43.043 --> 15:46.811
Well,
it's an ugly little sucker!

15:47.647 --> 15:50.248
I think it's a dog!

15:50.250 --> 15:51.816
That's no dog!

15:51.818 --> 15:53.618
Yeah, it's one of those
expensive dogs.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.386
I've seen pictures of 'em.

15:55.388 --> 15:58.056
I think Cher has one.

15:58.058 --> 16:02.593
Nah, that's one of those
weird animals from Australia.

16:02.595 --> 16:05.663
Oh, yeah, sure.
Then how did it get here?

16:05.665 --> 16:07.799
Don't you know anything?

16:07.801 --> 16:10.635
The continents
used to be connected.

16:10.637 --> 16:13.404
That is the stupidest thing
you ever said!

16:13.406 --> 16:15.540
Well, look it up!

16:18.578 --> 16:21.746
You know what that is?
It's an anteater.

16:22.916 --> 16:24.415
Are you sure?

16:24.417 --> 16:27.585
Yeah, and it's against the law
to shoot anteaters.

16:30.857 --> 16:34.192
What are you talkin' about?
You can shoot anteaters!

16:34.194 --> 16:35.593
[spits]

16:36.930 --> 16:39.030
I don't care what he is,
I'm gonna take him out

16:39.032 --> 16:40.331
and butcher him.

16:40.333 --> 16:41.833
[gasps]

16:41.835 --> 16:44.268
Why do you always get to do
all the butchering?

16:44.270 --> 16:48.139
Because you usually end up
mutilating all the good meat!

16:48.141 --> 16:49.440
[whimpering]

16:49.442 --> 16:51.109
I'll get the chain saw

16:51.111 --> 16:52.844
you make the salad.

16:57.617 --> 17:00.685
That guy orders me around
too much.

17:01.621 --> 17:02.987
Uh, yeah, you're getting

17:02.989 --> 17:05.623
the short end of the stick,
alright.

17:05.625 --> 17:07.091
I hear ya.

17:09.963 --> 17:11.262
I do hear you.

17:12.532 --> 17:15.299
You-you're talkin'!

17:15.301 --> 17:17.368
A-a talkin' anteater!

17:17.370 --> 17:20.304
Yeah, listen, uh, you should
get even with that guy.

17:20.306 --> 17:24.308
May I suggest a murder-suicide?

17:24.310 --> 17:25.643
You're really talkin'!

17:25.645 --> 17:27.645
Yeah, I'm talkin'.
Let's get past that.

17:27.647 --> 17:30.815
Why, I never ate anything
that talked.

17:30.817 --> 17:33.151
Well, my cousin's cockatoo.

17:33.153 --> 17:36.154
[chainsaw sputtering]

17:37.991 --> 17:40.725
ALF? ALF?

17:41.761 --> 17:43.828
Hey-hey, Earth to yokel.

17:43.830 --> 17:45.596
Focus in here, alright?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.932
I'm, uh, I'm not an anteater.

17:47.934 --> 17:52.904
I'm a magical creature
of the forest.

17:52.906 --> 17:57.341
If you release me,
I'll grant you three wishes.

17:57.343 --> 18:00.044
Oh, wait a second,
you're not a magical creature.

18:00.046 --> 18:02.513
You're just
an ordinary talking anteater.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.649
Well, look it up.

18:06.186 --> 18:07.785
Hey, Artie!

18:07.787 --> 18:10.688
- This anteater talks.
- What?

18:10.690 --> 18:13.357
Yeah, but don't listen to a word
he says, he's tricky.

18:13.359 --> 18:15.693
I think he's from the city.

18:15.695 --> 18:17.728
We've got to get you a woman.

18:17.730 --> 18:18.796
[knocking on door]

18:18.798 --> 18:19.864
Who could that be?

18:19.866 --> 18:22.600
Maybe it's a talking rabbit.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.268
Hello. I-I'm sorry
to bother you.

18:24.270 --> 18:28.039
But have you seen
a-anything unusual in the area?

18:28.041 --> 18:29.740
I know
that's a very general question

18:29.742 --> 18:31.075
but if you've seen
what I'm referring to

18:31.077 --> 18:32.877
I'm sure you'll know
what I mean.

18:32.879 --> 18:34.212
And if you haven't, well

18:34.214 --> 18:35.746
there'll be no point
in taking up your time

18:35.748 --> 18:37.482
with a long explanation.

18:37.484 --> 18:38.583
Who is this?

18:38.585 --> 18:41.786
Some guy with a run-on sentence.

18:41.788 --> 18:43.254
[ALF whining]

18:43.256 --> 18:45.890
ALF! Oh, ALF!

18:45.892 --> 18:48.593
Oh, ALF, thank goodness!

18:48.595 --> 18:50.261
Oh, we were<i> so</i> worried.

18:50.263 --> 18:51.796
Look, I'm sorry
about what happened.

18:51.798 --> 18:53.998
Are-are you okay?
Did you get lost?

18:54.000 --> 18:55.933
[clears throat]

18:55.935 --> 18:58.336
Oh, obviously,
I don't expect him to answer.

18:58.338 --> 19:00.271
I do.

19:00.273 --> 19:04.642
Well, thank you,
thank you for finding our..

19:06.312 --> 19:07.912
...anteater.

19:08.648 --> 19:10.414
Come on, ALF. Come on.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.616
Come on, boy, we got to go.

19:11.618 --> 19:13.384
Now wait just a minute.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.688
How do we know he's yours?

19:17.690 --> 19:19.991
Look at the way
he's hugging my leg.

19:19.993 --> 19:23.661
So what? I had a dog
who did that to everybody.

19:24.631 --> 19:26.330
I don't know
what kind of proof you want

19:26.332 --> 19:28.332
but ALF belongs to me.

19:28.334 --> 19:31.435
Possession
is nine-tenths of the law.

19:31.437 --> 19:34.071
That's right, he's half ours.

19:36.543 --> 19:38.776
Look, ALF is coming with me.

19:38.778 --> 19:40.378
And that's that.

19:42.348 --> 19:44.782
Did I mention
the generous $50 reward there is

19:44.784 --> 19:46.217
for finding ALF?

19:46.219 --> 19:47.818
Oh, 50 each?

19:47.820 --> 19:49.187
Uh, no-no, 25 apiece.

19:49.189 --> 19:52.223
- Oh, well, I was gonna say--
- Shut up!

19:52.225 --> 19:53.457
That's 50 apiece!

19:53.459 --> 19:56.627
Uh, $100 is ridiculous!

19:56.629 --> 19:57.662
[chainsaw sputtering]

19:57.664 --> 20:00.031
Ridiculous of me to say no!

20:02.335 --> 20:04.635
Alright.
Nice doing business with you.

20:04.637 --> 20:07.038
My pleasure. Come on.

20:07.040 --> 20:09.073
I'm telling you,
that thing can talk!

20:09.075 --> 20:11.309
Can't believe
those guys can talk.

20:11.311 --> 20:12.643
What was that?

20:12.645 --> 20:14.412
I said I was gonna
take him for a walk.

20:14.414 --> 20:16.214
Come, come, come. Come on, ALF.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.816
[door shuts]

20:18.818 --> 20:21.152
I'll hold your 25.

20:21.154 --> 20:22.920
Oh, thanks.

20:29.829 --> 20:32.663
[sighs]
ALF..

20:32.665 --> 20:35.333
ALF, I think
we'd make better time

20:35.335 --> 20:37.268
if you let go of my leg.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.769
Just a little longer.

20:38.771 --> 20:41.539
I've been through
a traumatic experience.

20:41.541 --> 20:44.909
Did I tell you how much
I appreciate you saving my life?

20:44.911 --> 20:46.877
Yes, you did, ALF.

20:46.879 --> 20:48.679
Did I also tell you that I think

20:48.681 --> 20:51.515
you're a credit
to the human race?

20:51.517 --> 20:53.684
Over and over.

20:53.686 --> 20:56.687
Did I tell you
I think you got us lost?

20:56.689 --> 20:58.289
- We're not lost.
- Yeah.

20:58.291 --> 21:00.424
I think
we've been walking in circles.

21:00.426 --> 21:03.361
That's because you've been
holding on to my leg.

21:03.363 --> 21:05.029
Well, anyway, we're lost.

21:05.031 --> 21:07.431
We're not lost.
We're going the right way.

21:07.433 --> 21:10.301
No, I'm pretty sure
we should be going that way.

21:10.303 --> 21:14.038
No, that is the way
back to the camper.

21:14.040 --> 21:17.875
No, that's the way
back to the camper.

21:17.877 --> 21:20.177
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.781
Alright, well, let's compromise.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.650
Let's go that way.

21:25.652 --> 21:28.619
No! No, no!
That's where those guys live.

21:28.621 --> 21:32.957
You got it! I'm gonna
return you, get my $100 back.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.395
You know what?
You're absolutely right.

21:37.397 --> 21:40.431
<i> That</i> is the way
back to the camper.

21:40.433 --> 21:43.834
- Whatever you say.
- All aboard!

21:49.075 --> 21:51.008
Here's more rain, Lucky.

21:52.512 --> 21:55.012
Rain again.

21:55.014 --> 21:58.316
- Rain from another angle.
- I took that one.

21:58.318 --> 22:01.018
Hang on, Lucky, we're just
getting to the good part.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.587
ALF, we've seen these
dozens of times.

22:03.589 --> 22:04.989
Yeah,<i> we</i> have.

22:04.991 --> 22:08.426
But I haven't shown them
to the Luck-meister.

22:08.428 --> 22:09.527
[meows]

22:10.697 --> 22:13.030
Here I am
after Willie rescued me

22:13.032 --> 22:14.665
from what I'd like to call

22:14.667 --> 22:17.401
The Cabin That Dripped Blood.

22:19.472 --> 22:22.340
Here I am, kissing the floor
of the motorhome.

22:23.443 --> 22:25.276
(ALF)
'Here I am, kissing Willie.'

22:25.278 --> 22:26.877
'Let me tell ya,
I got more response'

22:26.879 --> 22:29.213
from kissing the floor!
Hah! Hah!

22:29.215 --> 22:30.481
Oh, yeah, only kidding, my man!

22:30.483 --> 22:33.317
You saved my life.
Stand up and take a bow.

22:33.319 --> 22:37.288
Come on. Oh, he's modest.
I love that. Alright.

22:37.290 --> 22:39.557
Here I am,
lighting the barbeque.

22:40.893 --> 22:43.527
Here's the motorhome
going up in flames.

22:44.964 --> 22:46.997
Here we are, coming home by bus.

22:46.999 --> 22:49.100
That's me in the duffel bag.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.203
Here I am
being chained to a tree

22:52.205 --> 22:54.805
before the family took off
for San Diego!

22:54.807 --> 22:57.475
Hey, no hard feelings.
