WEBVTT

00:17.655 --> 00:20.000
This really is
the middle of nowhere, isn't it?

00:20.103 --> 00:22.965
Yeah, well, consider it a gift.

00:23.068 --> 00:25.448
No passing cars
means no witnesses.

00:25.551 --> 00:27.965
No one to send up
a flare to Grey Flag.

00:28.068 --> 00:29.724
This is bad.

00:29.827 --> 00:31.862
We're already on
thin ice with Captain James,

00:31.965 --> 00:34.517
and now we've laid
two dead bodies at his feet.

00:37.965 --> 00:39.965
<i>One that's
connected to Grey Flag...</i>

00:41.068 --> 00:43.068
- ...and the other that's...
- And one that is directly

00:43.172 --> 00:44.517
connected to me. Yeah.

00:46.482 --> 00:49.206
There's no coming back
from this, is there?

00:50.827 --> 00:52.241
I guess...

00:53.068 --> 00:55.758
...we shouldn't have run down
theories behind his back,

00:55.862 --> 00:57.448
no, but we've looped him in now.

00:57.551 --> 00:59.448
You know, we-we didn't
ask for permission...

00:59.551 --> 01:02.068
But we're gonna beg
for forgiveness.

01:14.862 --> 01:16.758
Cap.

01:29.862 --> 01:31.448
Trey.

01:35.137 --> 01:36.206
Hey.

01:36.310 --> 01:39.103
Wait... What are you...?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.655
What do we got, Cap?

01:51.758 --> 01:53.448
It's Hyde.

01:53.551 --> 01:54.862
What?

01:54.965 --> 01:56.724
Wait-wait-wait, okay,
hold-hold on a second.

01:56.827 --> 01:57.965
Hyde-Hyde, what?

01:58.068 --> 01:59.586
It's Andrew Hyde.

01:59.689 --> 02:01.413
A-Andrew Hyde?

02:02.724 --> 02:04.275
Who's Andrew Hyde?

02:07.172 --> 02:09.862
Trey's way into Grey Flag.

02:11.103 --> 02:12.896
Or at least he was.

02:16.310 --> 02:17.724
We got a lot to talk about.

02:17.827 --> 02:19.103
Yeah.

02:32.413 --> 02:35.965
The Feds provided this house so
we can work the Grey Flag case,

02:36.068 --> 02:37.103
steer clear of any

02:37.206 --> 02:39.448
Fenton-type moles at HQ.

02:39.551 --> 02:41.103
All right, C-Cap?

02:41.206 --> 02:42.448
Why didn't you tell
Cassie and me?

02:42.551 --> 02:44.655
What, you think
we're too close to it?

02:44.758 --> 02:47.517
I was ordered
to exclude you both.

02:47.620 --> 02:48.551
You...

02:48.655 --> 02:50.620
Sean had done recon on Cassie,

02:50.724 --> 02:52.137
abducted you and your brother.

02:52.241 --> 02:53.586
Look, I-I actually
wanted to tell you.

02:53.689 --> 02:55.413
You're two of my best,
you know that,

02:55.517 --> 02:56.724
but FBI wouldn't bend.

02:56.827 --> 02:58.310
Yeah, until tonight.

02:58.413 --> 03:01.482
All right,
so here's where we're at:

03:01.586 --> 03:03.172
Trey has gone under
to infiltrate Grey Flag.

03:03.275 --> 03:04.413
Wait, what?

03:04.517 --> 03:05.517
His insubordination,

03:05.620 --> 03:06.827
his DPS hearing and firing--

03:06.931 --> 03:08.862
it was all an act.

03:08.965 --> 03:10.517
And it was
a pretty damn good one,

03:10.620 --> 03:12.448
if I do say so myself.

03:12.551 --> 03:13.689
Uh, sorry,

03:13.793 --> 03:15.413
how long has
this plan been underway?

03:15.517 --> 03:18.586
Well, our old friend
Federal Agent Tessa Graves

03:18.689 --> 03:20.103
reached out right after
Cordell's run-in

03:20.206 --> 03:21.172
with the Grey Flag chemist.

03:25.068 --> 03:26.586
We thought that attack
was the end of them,

03:26.689 --> 03:28.413
but FBI spotted
pockets of activity

03:28.517 --> 03:30.310
resembling their MO
across the country.

03:30.413 --> 03:31.620
We're talking nationwide now?

03:31.724 --> 03:32.862
No, they're not really
organized yet.

03:32.965 --> 03:35.620
But, uh, underground chatter

03:35.724 --> 03:37.172
named Texas as the home base.

03:37.275 --> 03:39.172
Feds suspected
they were still operating

03:39.275 --> 03:41.068
in the shadows.

03:41.172 --> 03:44.482
That's when they called
to set up a meeting.

03:46.655 --> 03:48.965
<i>Undercover mission was
approved on Thanksgiving.</i>

03:49.068 --> 03:50.655
<i>- Thanksgiving?
- After the storm cleared,</i>

03:50.758 --> 03:53.310
<i>Trey and I met with the Feds.</i>

03:53.413 --> 03:55.862
<i>By then, we knew</i>

03:55.965 --> 03:58.344
Trey had to be the one,
the only one, read in on this,

03:58.448 --> 03:59.931
especially after Cassie
let it slip

04:00.034 --> 04:01.793
that you two opened up
the Grey Flag evidence.

04:03.068 --> 04:04.862
But, look, that is
what it is, right?

04:04.965 --> 04:06.068
And we are where we are,

04:06.172 --> 04:07.275
and now that we're here,
the four of us

04:07.379 --> 04:08.310
need to act like one Ranger,

04:08.413 --> 04:10.172
all right?

04:10.275 --> 04:12.862
Right hand always knows
what the left hand's doing,

04:12.965 --> 04:14.620
and vice versa.

04:14.724 --> 04:16.413
The lies, the defiance,
the secrets,

04:16.517 --> 04:18.344
it's... in the past.

04:18.448 --> 04:19.931
Well, not exactly
that far in the past

04:20.034 --> 04:22.413
since you just told us
ten seconds ago.

04:23.793 --> 04:24.965
And, uh,

04:25.068 --> 04:26.862
you're cool with this,
you're solid?

04:26.965 --> 04:29.413
I got this, Cass.
I mean, I've held my own

04:29.517 --> 04:31.172
around guys like this
back when I served.

04:31.275 --> 04:32.241
But at the end of the day,

04:32.344 --> 04:34.310
it's... it's Cap's call.

04:36.206 --> 04:37.827
Yeah, right.

04:37.931 --> 04:39.379
Yeah, Cap's call.

04:39.482 --> 04:40.827
And, uh, now we know

04:40.931 --> 04:44.344
we're all in the same
circle of trust together.

04:45.413 --> 04:47.137
All right, Tommy Adams

04:47.241 --> 04:49.965
was off the grid
for, like, 15 years.

04:50.068 --> 04:51.517
How'd you guys find his place?

04:53.551 --> 04:56.068
<i>Julia, Julia Johnson.</i>

04:57.241 --> 04:58.275
<i>She had a source</i>

04:58.379 --> 04:59.413
<i>who knew how to locate Tommy.</i>

04:59.517 --> 05:01.275
She's in D.C. right now.

05:01.379 --> 05:02.551
She'll be headed back soon.

05:02.655 --> 05:04.551
- Julia Johnson, huh?
- Yeah.

05:04.655 --> 05:06.275
You still in contact with her?

05:06.379 --> 05:07.551
Uh, yes, sir.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.965
All right, reach out to her,

05:09.068 --> 05:10.517
see if she turned over
any new Grey Flag stones

05:10.620 --> 05:11.517
while she was gone.

05:11.620 --> 05:13.137
No need to mention Trey.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.551
You realize this means that
what Tommy told me is correct?

05:16.655 --> 05:18.241
Someone is hunting
my Marine unit.

05:18.344 --> 05:21.310
And not just someone,
but it seems to be Grey Flag.

05:21.413 --> 05:24.000
- Yeah.
- And now there's just one left.

05:24.103 --> 05:27.586
Yeah, me, so I'm the last one
on their hit list.

05:27.689 --> 05:29.965
But wait, if Grey Flag
wanted you dead,

05:30.068 --> 05:32.862
why not just ice you when they
had you chained up at Westvale?

05:32.965 --> 05:35.965
I don't know. All I know is
that whatever they want,

05:36.068 --> 05:39.448
uh, it certainly includes
a personal vendetta against me.

05:39.551 --> 05:40.689
Yeah.

05:40.793 --> 05:42.000
Which is why
our support for Trey

05:42.103 --> 05:43.620
needs to come
at a safe distance,

05:43.724 --> 05:45.034
especially yours, Walker,
and that's an order.

05:45.137 --> 05:46.793
Look, you're too close
to the whole thing, man.

05:46.896 --> 05:49.310
Contact Julia, see what
she knows. You can help out

05:49.413 --> 05:51.379
without making
everybody else a target.

05:52.206 --> 05:53.655
Captain's orders. You got it.

05:53.758 --> 05:56.068
Okay. Listen, any intel

05:56.172 --> 05:58.206
that can affect this operation
needs to be shared

05:58.310 --> 06:00.655
immediately and completely.

06:01.551 --> 06:02.517
Right hand, left hand.

06:02.620 --> 06:04.172
Do we all copy that?

06:04.275 --> 06:05.172
Copy.

06:05.275 --> 06:06.448
Yes, sir.

06:06.551 --> 06:08.275
Copy.

06:08.379 --> 06:09.758
All right.

06:17.655 --> 06:19.655
<i>♪ Yeah, on my way, on my way♪</i>

06:19.758 --> 06:20.689
Oh, thank you.

06:20.793 --> 06:23.344
<i>♪ Oh, on my way♪</i>

06:23.448 --> 06:25.758

06:30.310 --> 06:32.655

06:34.275 --> 06:35.689
Hey.

06:36.448 --> 06:37.793
Open it, Cassie.

06:45.000 --> 06:46.758
- What's it say?
-"For the boot:

06:46.862 --> 06:49.655
Oswald 0-9-3-0 Springdale."

06:49.758 --> 06:50.827
Okay, what does that mean?

06:50.931 --> 06:53.068
0-9-3-0. 9:30.

06:53.172 --> 06:55.068
It's military time.
It's 9:30 a.m.

06:55.172 --> 06:57.206
"For the boot."
Boot is slang for "recruit."

06:57.310 --> 06:58.206
Yeah.

06:58.310 --> 06:59.586
Whoever's texting Andrew

06:59.689 --> 07:01.137
must be referring to Trey,
so that...

07:01.241 --> 07:03.448
That means that
this is the instructions

07:03.551 --> 07:05.068
for Trey's
first Grey Flag assignment.

07:05.172 --> 07:06.275
Okay, so we got a time

07:06.379 --> 07:08.517
and we have a street--
Springdale.

07:08.620 --> 07:10.103
Let me check
this street real quick.

07:10.206 --> 07:12.862
Springdale Road.

07:13.896 --> 07:15.068
It's a pretty big street.

07:15.172 --> 07:16.724
Now, "Oswald."

07:16.827 --> 07:18.034
As in...

07:18.137 --> 07:19.586
- Lee Harvey?
- Lee Harvey Oswald.

07:19.689 --> 07:22.137
Dealey Plaza, shot JFK
from a book depository.

07:22.241 --> 07:24.551
Check if there are any
on Springdale Road.

07:26.551 --> 07:28.620
Or, uh, libraries, more likely.

07:28.724 --> 07:30.793
All right, I'm on it.

07:30.896 --> 07:33.448
Search libraries
on Springdale Road.

07:34.206 --> 07:37.896
Yeah. There's one library
on Springdale Road,

07:38.000 --> 07:40.344
and it's been abandoned
since 2004.

07:40.448 --> 07:41.689
Well, that's got
to be the place.

07:41.793 --> 07:42.965
Tomorrow, while Walker's
with Julia,

07:43.068 --> 07:45.103
Cassie and I
will keep an eye on Trey.

07:45.206 --> 07:47.103
- All right.
- Okay.

07:47.206 --> 07:51.448
All right. Hey, um, as someone
who's been under before,

07:51.551 --> 07:52.758
just do what's best
for the case.

07:52.862 --> 07:55.103
Don't get attached to anyone.

07:55.206 --> 07:57.793
You'd be surprised
how a sad story can pull you in.

07:58.965 --> 08:00.379
All right.
Appreciate that, Walker.

08:00.482 --> 08:01.931
- You got it.
- Yeah.

08:02.034 --> 08:03.758
All right, everybody,
get some sleep tonight.

08:03.862 --> 08:06.034
Tomorrow is day one.
Fresh start,

08:06.137 --> 08:07.379
clean slates.

08:07.482 --> 08:08.896
Let's do it.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.310
<i>♪ Walked out the door
to another new day♪</i>

08:24.413 --> 08:27.724
<i>♪ Another night tryin'
to drink my blues away...♪</i>

08:27.827 --> 08:29.793
Isn't Biscuit just the cutest?

08:29.896 --> 08:31.620
Aw, the sweetest, too.

08:33.517 --> 08:34.758
Uh, Stella,
why are you here so early?

08:34.862 --> 08:36.448
God, the option to sleep in

08:36.551 --> 08:38.000
is completely wasted on you.

08:38.103 --> 08:40.206
Early risers get first pick
of breakfast meats.

08:40.310 --> 08:41.586
Aw, dang it.

08:41.689 --> 08:43.103
Yeah, there's extra bacon
in the oven.

08:43.206 --> 08:45.275
I asked Stella
to come here to help me

08:45.379 --> 08:47.448
work on the look-book
for the horse rescue.

08:47.551 --> 08:50.310
Yeah, it's going to have each
horse's story and profile

08:50.413 --> 08:52.448
and then some basic care
instructions for beginners.

08:52.551 --> 08:54.655
Yeah, can I take
a look at these instructions?

08:54.758 --> 08:56.344
Now that I've got
a stake in this venture,

08:56.448 --> 08:58.724
I'd sure like to make sure
that everything's squared away.

08:58.827 --> 09:00.241
Now, I have all the paperwork.

09:00.344 --> 09:03.068
I can put a laminated copy
in the binder.

09:03.172 --> 09:04.620
Well, I think your dad
just wants to make sure

09:04.724 --> 09:06.000
that you have a clear vision

09:06.103 --> 09:07.620
of what you want to accomplish

09:07.724 --> 09:10.103
with this
Walker Rescues venture.

09:10.206 --> 09:12.655
I want people to feel fulfilled

09:12.758 --> 09:14.344
when they take care
of the horses,

09:14.448 --> 09:15.655
like I did when I was doing

09:15.758 --> 09:17.310
community service
at the horse stables.

09:17.413 --> 09:18.586
Wasn't that court-mandated?

09:18.689 --> 09:20.103
Way to miss the point.

09:20.206 --> 09:23.000
Yes, and I would like
to show how powerful

09:23.103 --> 09:24.758
equine therapy can actually be.

09:24.862 --> 09:26.724
Chelsea and Donna
both had different methods,

09:26.827 --> 09:28.827
but maybe we could hire them

09:28.931 --> 09:31.793
as remote consultants to
further shape our programming.

09:31.896 --> 09:33.310
We have the funds for that?

09:33.413 --> 09:36.551
We're gonna put a donation
button on our website.

09:36.655 --> 09:39.068
Yeah, because who wouldn't
donate to a horse charity?

09:39.172 --> 09:41.448
It's about humans
helping horses.

09:41.551 --> 09:43.689
And horses helping humans.

09:43.793 --> 09:45.137
We can throw together a pitch

09:45.241 --> 09:47.517
and make a list
of organizations to approach.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.241
You know, I'd be happy

09:49.344 --> 09:51.241
to help you craft
a mission statement.

09:51.344 --> 09:54.000
You may only get one chance
to get a yes,

09:54.103 --> 09:57.172
and so you got to be
effective and focused.

09:58.172 --> 09:59.103
You do realize that I was on

09:59.206 --> 10:00.689
a few non-profit boards, right?

10:00.793 --> 10:01.931
And you guys should
do something really cool

10:02.034 --> 10:03.482
or crazy that
makes you unforgettable.

10:03.586 --> 10:05.000
You know, I think it'd be sick

10:05.103 --> 10:07.551
if you guys threw, like,
a-a photo booth for horses.

10:07.655 --> 10:09.206
You know, have big props

10:09.310 --> 10:12.655
like big sunglasses and
mustaches to put on the horses.

10:13.724 --> 10:15.724
Why would you put
a mustache on a horse?

10:15.827 --> 10:18.896
Uh, it was just...

10:20.827 --> 10:22.344
You guys are
enemies of innovation.

10:26.482 --> 10:28.275
Coming.

10:30.620 --> 10:31.931
- Hi. Come in.
- Hey.

10:33.206 --> 10:34.689
Thought about bringing flowers,

10:34.793 --> 10:35.655
then I felt like
it wasn't exactly

10:35.758 --> 10:36.862
your vibe, but I didn't

10:36.965 --> 10:38.655
want to come empty-handed, so...

10:38.758 --> 10:40.517
- a sandwich.
- Sandwich.

10:40.620 --> 10:41.862
For me?

10:41.965 --> 10:43.931
Thank you.

10:44.793 --> 10:45.896
I'm sorry about Tommy.

10:46.000 --> 10:49.068
Yeah, yeah. Uh, me, too.

10:51.689 --> 10:52.758
Can I, uh,

10:52.862 --> 10:54.758
get you something to drink?

10:54.862 --> 10:56.896
- I'm good, thanks.
- Okay.

10:57.000 --> 10:59.172
So, uh, when'd you
get back from D.C.?

10:59.275 --> 11:00.344
Late last night.

11:00.448 --> 11:02.034
I linked up with
a friend at the Pentagon

11:02.137 --> 11:04.034
- about Tommy's theories.
- Yeah?

11:04.137 --> 11:06.275
He's leaving a USB drive
for me at our dead drop.

11:07.172 --> 11:09.275
Miscellaneous files
on your unit.

11:09.379 --> 11:11.034
Just like that?

11:11.137 --> 11:12.482
So...

11:12.586 --> 11:15.172
he's just leaving you
all this without question?

11:15.275 --> 11:16.896
He owes me.

11:18.137 --> 11:19.758
And I told him I'm writing
a story to expose the truth.

11:19.862 --> 11:23.000
Journalism is kind of
punk rock that way.

11:23.103 --> 11:24.241
No rules,

11:24.344 --> 11:25.724
all justice.

11:25.827 --> 11:27.310
All justice?

11:27.413 --> 11:31.275
Not sure all journalists
share your philosophy.

11:31.379 --> 11:32.724
You're not wrong,

11:32.827 --> 11:33.931
And I'm not even sure
what'll be on those files.

11:34.034 --> 11:35.689
Could be key evidence

11:35.793 --> 11:37.896
or could be
a whole lot of trash.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.275
Right. Well, either way, uh,

11:40.379 --> 11:43.137
I'm not really looking forward
to revisiting my past, you know.

11:43.241 --> 11:45.793
At least not that part of it.

11:45.896 --> 11:47.896
'Cause of your mission
over there?

11:51.758 --> 11:53.896
Uh, Coop's death.

11:54.862 --> 11:56.965
Coop's death did a number on me.

11:57.068 --> 11:59.482
Uh, you know,
I'd never had someone

11:59.586 --> 12:01.965
so close to me die.

12:02.068 --> 12:04.793
Especially not the way he died.

12:04.896 --> 12:06.758
You were just
a 20-something kid.

12:06.862 --> 12:08.344
Yeah, I know, but

12:08.448 --> 12:11.034
even with Tommy, I mean,

12:11.137 --> 12:13.310
he and I hadn't talked
in however long,

12:13.413 --> 12:15.689
and it all just
came back, you know?

12:15.793 --> 12:18.137
Like, uh, like I was back there.

12:19.931 --> 12:21.724
I'm not

12:21.827 --> 12:24.551
sure why
I'm telling you all this.

12:24.655 --> 12:28.034
Well, I've been told
that I'm a good listener.

12:28.137 --> 12:31.000
I guess in your line of work,
you'd have to be.

12:32.034 --> 12:33.827
Julia,

12:33.931 --> 12:36.689
I am choosing to trust you.

12:36.793 --> 12:39.206
Enough to believe
that you're genuinely

12:39.310 --> 12:41.655
trying to help me find anything
to take Grey Flag down.

12:41.758 --> 12:45.448
I can't promise those files
will be remotely helpful,

12:45.551 --> 12:48.068
but I promise I do want to help.

12:48.172 --> 12:50.689
And not out of pity, but because

12:50.793 --> 12:53.413
no rules, all justice, you know?

12:53.517 --> 12:55.793
That, plus you don't need
to hear my sad stories.

12:55.896 --> 12:58.103
Please, I've heard a million.

12:58.206 --> 13:01.000
Even, uh, lived a few, too.

13:01.965 --> 13:03.275
Morse code?

13:03.379 --> 13:05.758
Like when we met, in captivity?

13:05.862 --> 13:06.793
Too soon?

13:08.931 --> 13:10.413
Just trying to be
of some comfort.

13:10.517 --> 13:11.965
Anyway, don't you
think we're past the point

13:12.068 --> 13:13.620
of speaking in code?

13:13.724 --> 13:14.620
Yeah.

13:20.482 --> 13:23.344
"Dropped." Let's go.

13:24.379 --> 13:26.275
Let's go.

13:28.275 --> 13:30.896
Ah, Mr. Golden.
It's good to see you.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.103
Hey there, August Walker.
Mind giving me a hand?

13:33.206 --> 13:35.241
- Yeah, sure thing.
- Thanks, dude.

13:35.344 --> 13:36.724
I didn't realize
that you were the one

13:36.827 --> 13:38.413
throwing the BYOB event today.

13:38.517 --> 13:41.758
Oh, yeah, just a casual mixer
for some key players

13:41.862 --> 13:43.413
in some non-profits
and foundations.

13:43.517 --> 13:45.586
It's a breezy way to score
endorsements for the mayor.

13:45.689 --> 13:48.482
Favors are currency, after all.

13:48.586 --> 13:50.172
"Favors are currency."

13:50.275 --> 13:52.344
I've never thought
about it that way.

13:52.448 --> 13:54.379
Speaking of favors,

13:54.482 --> 13:57.000
are you sure you don't
want me to see what I can do

13:57.103 --> 13:59.793
to help expedite your bar's
liquor license paperwork?

13:59.896 --> 14:02.137
Okay, personally,
I would love that,

14:02.241 --> 14:05.000
but, um, yeah, my dad's
just been real strict

14:05.103 --> 14:07.137
about following
the TABC's process,

14:07.241 --> 14:10.000
same as every other business.

14:10.827 --> 14:12.137
Dad's a little stubborn, huh?

14:12.241 --> 14:15.448
Yeah. Yeah, he, uh, can be,

14:15.551 --> 14:16.793
but I'm used to it.

14:16.896 --> 14:19.344
It's just a part of being
a Ranger's son, I guess.

14:19.448 --> 14:22.068
Yeah, well, just because that's
how things are always done

14:22.172 --> 14:25.000
doesn't make 'em
suck any less, huh?

14:25.965 --> 14:27.517
Yeah. Yeah.

14:28.448 --> 14:30.344
Hey, is, uh,
is Cassie coming around?

14:30.448 --> 14:32.275
If she is, I got to
warn the guys in the back

14:32.379 --> 14:33.896
to keep the queso flowing.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.275
You know, I don't think so.

14:37.103 --> 14:38.862
Cassie and I
stopped seeing each other.

14:38.965 --> 14:41.172
Ah, dude, I'm...

14:41.275 --> 14:42.448
I'm really sorry about that.

14:42.551 --> 14:44.103
Breakups are
the worst, you know?

14:44.206 --> 14:46.034
I'm not sure
you can call it a breakup

14:46.137 --> 14:48.827
if we never officially started.

14:48.931 --> 14:51.896
Hey, a relationship
is a relationship

14:52.000 --> 14:53.379
if it was real to you, right?

14:54.344 --> 14:56.344
I've never thought
of it that way.

14:56.448 --> 14:58.000
Fortunately, work's
been keeping me

14:58.103 --> 14:59.103
pretty busy, you know?

14:59.206 --> 15:01.000
Distractions and all that?

15:02.034 --> 15:04.034
Yeah, yeah. Um...

15:05.103 --> 15:07.931
Hey, my sister and my uncle,

15:08.034 --> 15:09.379
they're-they're
looking for donors

15:09.482 --> 15:10.931
to get their horse therapy
business off the ground,

15:11.034 --> 15:12.275
and I was,
I was wondering if-if maybe

15:12.379 --> 15:13.827
I could invite them by.

15:13.931 --> 15:15.689
Yeah, of course.

15:15.793 --> 15:17.620
Happy to make introductions.

15:17.724 --> 15:19.206
Awesome.

15:31.965 --> 15:34.758
You must be Trey Barnett,
Andrew's security consultant?

15:34.862 --> 15:36.517
Yeah, that's me.

15:36.620 --> 15:38.551
Lana Jones. Pleasure.

15:38.655 --> 15:40.172
Dial 1 for the boss.

15:40.275 --> 15:43.482
It's the only number in there.
The only one we need.

15:43.586 --> 15:45.206
High praise from Andrew.

15:45.310 --> 15:47.275
He mentioned you're itching
to get back in action

15:47.379 --> 15:49.034
after the Rangers
put you on ice.

15:49.137 --> 15:50.724
Yeah, those white hats
wouldn't know talent

15:50.827 --> 15:53.068
if it roundhouse-kicked them
in the head.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.103
Well, Andrew swore
you can handle

15:56.206 --> 15:58.344
much higher-level work
than being lookout,

15:58.448 --> 16:01.724
but higher-ups want to know
you're not above simple tasks.

16:01.827 --> 16:03.241
A test of ego.

16:03.344 --> 16:06.000
There's no ego here.
I'm your lookout.

16:06.103 --> 16:07.655
Killer.

16:07.758 --> 16:08.896
Any questions?

16:09.000 --> 16:11.379
- No.
- Good,

16:11.482 --> 16:12.620
'cause that was another test.

16:12.724 --> 16:14.103
All right,
all you have to do now

16:14.206 --> 16:15.965
is just keep watch
while I go inside,

16:16.068 --> 16:17.586
deal with some buddies.

16:17.689 --> 16:18.655
If things go awry,

16:18.758 --> 16:20.103
handle accordingly.

16:20.206 --> 16:22.620
All right, sounds easy enough.

16:39.379 --> 16:41.241
Didn't think Trey's
first play undercover

16:41.344 --> 16:43.931
would be turning his neck
180 degrees every six seconds.

16:44.034 --> 16:47.275
Yes, I am so glad we've got

16:47.379 --> 16:49.655
these security cameras to
capture every precious moment.

16:50.655 --> 16:52.241
Hey, um,

16:52.344 --> 16:54.000
it's not lost on me

16:54.103 --> 16:56.586
that what Trey
and I have been doing

16:56.689 --> 16:59.517
smells a lot like what Miles
and Fenton put you through.

17:01.379 --> 17:02.689
When you brought me on,

17:02.793 --> 17:04.448
you said you would
always be straight up.

17:04.551 --> 17:06.206
It's why I put
the badge back on.

17:06.310 --> 17:08.931
I really did want to
read you guys in sooner.

17:09.034 --> 17:10.241
FBI shut it down.

17:10.344 --> 17:11.793
And then,
after you got caught...

17:12.620 --> 17:15.896
...lying, um, I couldn't
really defend you, you know?

17:16.000 --> 17:18.310
Yeah, I know, I get it.

17:19.344 --> 17:22.551
I know I can be
a little enthusiastic.

17:22.655 --> 17:24.827
Just a smidge, you think?

17:24.931 --> 17:27.758
No, your out-of-the-box
thinking is an asset.

17:27.862 --> 17:29.862
It really is.

17:29.965 --> 17:31.275
Just, you know,
before you spring

17:31.379 --> 17:32.758
one of your
out-of-the-box plans,

17:32.862 --> 17:34.068
give me a heads-up.

17:34.172 --> 17:37.586
All right,
I think I can manage that.

17:49.586 --> 17:52.448
Your vision for Walker Rescues
aligns perfectly

17:52.551 --> 17:53.793
with our organization's efforts,

17:53.896 --> 17:55.275
and I love how it touches
each generation

17:55.379 --> 17:56.724
in your household.

17:56.827 --> 17:58.620
That really says something
about your values.

17:59.724 --> 18:03.000
Well, we're a very tight-knit
family, Georgia.

18:03.103 --> 18:04.068
I'll draw up
your grant paperwork

18:04.172 --> 18:05.310
when I'm back in the office.

18:05.413 --> 18:07.068
Expect to hear
from me next week.

18:07.896 --> 18:09.137
Thank you so much.

18:09.241 --> 18:11.448
- Of course.
- Yeah, thank you. Very excited

18:11.551 --> 18:12.862
- to get started on all this, yeah.
- Absolutely.

18:12.965 --> 18:14.689
- Take care.
- Thanks.

18:18.379 --> 18:19.551
Congratulations, you two.
- Golly.

18:19.655 --> 18:20.965
Listen, I'm glad you got
the right funding

18:21.068 --> 18:22.275
to follow through
with your plans.

18:22.379 --> 18:23.931
I'm proud of you both.

18:24.034 --> 18:25.931
Honestly, Gramps, you might
have been our secret weapon.

18:26.034 --> 18:28.137
Yeah, she really liked that
every generation was involved.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.379
Yeah, well,

18:29.482 --> 18:31.482
the presentation
that Mawline helped

18:31.586 --> 18:33.827
- you two craft didn't hurt.
- Let's grab some drinks, Bon.

18:33.931 --> 18:35.413
I think this deserves a toast.

18:35.517 --> 18:37.103
Shirley Temples
all the way around?

18:37.206 --> 18:39.551
- Yeah, sounds good.
- Yes.

18:39.655 --> 18:41.241
Yeah, all right.

18:43.172 --> 18:44.862
Hey, great job today.

18:44.965 --> 18:46.413
You, too.

18:46.517 --> 18:48.965
And I was thinking we could
use the donation money

18:49.068 --> 18:50.862
to get some rehab equipment
for the horses.

18:50.965 --> 18:53.448
I bet we could find a good deal
on vibration plates.

18:53.551 --> 18:56.172
Or a solarium,
if we really wanted to splurge.

18:56.275 --> 18:58.517
Or I think a better
use of the funds

18:58.620 --> 19:00.517
might be to hire those
consultants so we can offer

19:00.620 --> 19:02.206
equine therapy
sooner than later.

19:02.310 --> 19:04.344
The horses need their therapy,
too, though.

19:04.448 --> 19:06.448
Understood, but there's
a way to go about that.

19:06.551 --> 19:08.689
You know, I had
a whole team managing my budget

19:08.793 --> 19:11.793
for my D.A. campaign.
I picked up some stuff.

19:11.896 --> 19:13.206
I could go through
our potential spending

19:13.310 --> 19:14.137
and divide
the funds accordingly.

19:14.241 --> 19:16.586
Okay, but...

19:16.689 --> 19:18.000
I thought we were
equal partners.

19:18.103 --> 19:19.931
As in, we're going to talk
about all this,

19:20.034 --> 19:21.344
- right?
- Right.

19:21.448 --> 19:22.724
Because it feels like
you're just deciding

19:22.827 --> 19:24.586
what to do
with the money right now.

19:27.000 --> 19:28.862
Everything okay?

19:28.965 --> 19:30.931
We're-we're just talking.

19:31.034 --> 19:33.275
We're just trying to
figure out how we can get

19:33.379 --> 19:34.724
what we want out of this,
that's all.

19:34.827 --> 19:36.206
I thought
we were on the same page,

19:36.310 --> 19:37.862
but, I don't know,
maybe I wasn't

19:37.965 --> 19:39.379
being realistic or something.

19:39.482 --> 19:42.068
No, no, it's all
possible, it's just...

19:42.172 --> 19:44.482
I think we just need
to figure it out.

19:44.586 --> 19:47.724
Th-There's nothing wrong
with having differing passions.

19:48.620 --> 19:51.206
Look, your granddad
is already helping you

19:51.310 --> 19:52.931
with the horse part
of Walker Rescues.

19:53.034 --> 19:55.551
Why don't you let me
help out on the people part?

19:55.655 --> 19:57.517
You know, I can
take on operations,

19:57.620 --> 19:59.965
budgeting, organizing,

20:00.068 --> 20:01.551
what have you,

20:01.655 --> 20:03.000
which will give you
a chance to focus on

20:03.103 --> 20:05.034
your shared vision,

20:05.137 --> 20:06.931
whatever that evolves into.

20:08.344 --> 20:10.310
And, yes,
mission statements can change.

20:10.413 --> 20:14.344
Well, that sounds good, right?

20:14.448 --> 20:15.965
I mean, I think it is
important to remember

20:16.068 --> 20:18.724
why we started this
in the first place.

20:18.827 --> 20:21.241
We wanted to help people.

20:22.206 --> 20:23.689
Horses and humans.

20:26.137 --> 20:28.724
Welcome aboard, Mawline.

20:28.827 --> 20:30.172
Thank you.

20:31.862 --> 20:33.896
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

20:45.965 --> 20:48.586
I know Coop
was important to you.

20:48.689 --> 20:50.965
He was important
to his family, too.

20:52.103 --> 20:54.655
It might be nice to have that
conversation with Ms. Cooper.

20:54.758 --> 20:57.413
You know,
share some memories of him.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.862
My memories of Coop
and our time in Afghanistan

20:59.965 --> 21:03.206
haven't really left
such a nice feeling lately.

21:10.137 --> 21:12.068
This is the spot.

21:12.172 --> 21:14.827
Okay. All clear.

21:29.413 --> 21:31.379
Guess we're headed
down memory lane.

21:44.931 --> 21:45.965
Okay.

21:47.413 --> 21:49.689
Wow. Okay. You weren't kidding.

21:49.793 --> 21:53.620
Uh, how-how did your source,
uh, get all this?

21:53.724 --> 21:55.000
Couldn't tell you.

21:55.103 --> 21:56.448
It's going to take a while

21:56.551 --> 21:58.137
to decrypt them all
before we can see them.

21:58.241 --> 21:59.827
Okay.

21:59.931 --> 22:02.620
But I've got an idea
how we could kill time.

22:03.931 --> 22:05.517
Where did you say
Ms. Cooper lives again?

22:05.620 --> 22:07.241
I-I don't think
she wants to see me

22:07.344 --> 22:08.517
as much as you think she does.

22:08.620 --> 22:11.275
Why don't we just try, you know?

22:11.379 --> 22:13.448
You could show up,
see how it goes.

22:14.689 --> 22:15.931
Not empty-handed, though.

22:16.034 --> 22:17.344
Bringing a gift
always helps. Here.

22:17.448 --> 22:19.896
- What, like a sandwich?
- Funny.

22:21.000 --> 22:23.103
Let's look at her socials,
see what she likes.

22:23.206 --> 22:25.827
All right.

22:30.103 --> 22:31.793
Oh.

22:31.896 --> 22:33.758
What?

22:36.413 --> 22:38.000
She died?

22:39.275 --> 22:40.689
Last week, it says.

22:40.793 --> 22:42.724
She went gently in her sleep
from natural causes.

22:42.827 --> 22:44.827
She was... 92.

22:48.344 --> 22:50.517
I guess we can add that

22:50.620 --> 22:53.034
to the list of things
I won't be able to make right.

23:00.724 --> 23:04.241
Why don't you say what
you wanted to say aloud?

23:04.344 --> 23:06.310
Like, if she was here right now,

23:06.413 --> 23:08.241
what would you say?

23:09.137 --> 23:11.379
I don't know.
That's the problem.

23:11.482 --> 23:14.275
I mean, not that
there's anything

23:14.379 --> 23:16.793
I could say to her right now,

23:16.896 --> 23:21.000
but even when she was with us,

23:21.103 --> 23:24.448
and I went to her house
with Cassie

23:24.551 --> 23:26.068
to speak with her,
I guess I thought

23:26.172 --> 23:28.379
I would just walk in
and look her in the eyes

23:28.482 --> 23:31.000
and talk with her about her son.

23:40.413 --> 23:42.034
<i>I blanked. I guess I froze.</i>

23:42.137 --> 23:43.448
Couldn't do it.

23:43.551 --> 23:46.034
If you didn't freeze...

23:46.137 --> 23:50.448
if you had a chance,
what would you say?

23:52.379 --> 23:53.793
Okay, um...

23:53.896 --> 23:54.931
I would say...

23:58.137 --> 24:01.000
I'd talk to her
about Coop's flag.

24:02.551 --> 24:05.517
I'd tell her why I kept it
all those years.

24:06.827 --> 24:07.827
You know, it was the only

24:07.931 --> 24:10.379
personal item left afterwards,

24:10.482 --> 24:12.551
and, uh...

24:12.655 --> 24:14.827
our unit would take it
on missions with us,

24:14.931 --> 24:17.206
you know, to-to keep
his memory alive.

24:17.310 --> 24:21.137
It even got burnt
in an attack months later,

24:21.241 --> 24:22.620
but I still kept it.

24:22.724 --> 24:25.793
I-I held on to it.
I didn't want to leave it behind

24:28.586 --> 24:30.310
I didn't want to leave him
behind, you know?

24:30.413 --> 24:32.000
Um...

24:32.103 --> 24:33.482
And then,
when I got back stateside

24:33.586 --> 24:36.413
with it...

24:36.517 --> 24:39.000
I hid it away

24:39.103 --> 24:40.620
because...

24:43.586 --> 24:46.482
Yeah, I've put away
plenty of things.

24:46.586 --> 24:47.965
Hiding them from myself

24:48.068 --> 24:51.793
but keeping them
to remember, to relive.

24:53.275 --> 24:54.965
It's one way to cope, I guess.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.068
But it was wrong of me

24:58.172 --> 24:59.586
to keep that flag
when it should have gone

24:59.689 --> 25:00.586
to Coop's next of kin.

25:00.689 --> 25:01.689
It was selfish of me.

25:01.793 --> 25:02.620
I lost a friend, yes, sure.

25:02.724 --> 25:06.241
I lost my mentor,

25:06.344 --> 25:07.620
but Ms. Cooper

25:07.724 --> 25:10.034
lost a son.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.482
There's closure
we get ourselves,

25:14.586 --> 25:16.448
and there's closure we...

25:16.551 --> 25:18.551
give ourselves.

25:20.965 --> 25:22.896
Sometimes that's
got to be good enough.

got the briefcase,

but she caught a bullet.
If I don't get her

26:42.000 --> 26:43.379
to a hospital,
she's gonna bleed out.

26:43.482 --> 26:44.413

to stop the bleeding.

27:06.517 --> 27:08.620
Hey, hey.

27:12.965 --> 27:14.620
Trey doesn't have anything
to stop the bleeding.

27:14.724 --> 27:16.103
What are you doing?

27:16.206 --> 27:18.620
We both know he's
not going to let her die.

27:18.724 --> 27:19.896
Perez, where are you going?

27:20.000 --> 27:21.172
Cap, I have
an out-of-the-box impulse

27:21.275 --> 27:22.862
to run out there
and bring this to Trey.

27:22.965 --> 27:24.172
Any objections?

27:26.896 --> 27:28.275
Hand off the gauze,

27:28.379 --> 27:29.448
come right back.

27:29.551 --> 27:30.689
- Come right back.
- Yes, sir.

27:43.448 --> 27:45.344
Sir. Sir, is she okay?

27:45.448 --> 27:46.862
Do you need any assistance?

27:46.965 --> 27:48.241
Yeah, she's good, she's good.

- It's fine, Cap.

28:27.310 --> 28:29.827

28:33.758 --> 28:35.310
It looks worse than it is.

28:35.413 --> 28:36.724

I would have come right back

for the rogue shooter.

28:44.758 --> 28:46.000

let you go out there.

28:47.310 --> 28:48.344
Hey.

28:49.103 --> 28:52.000
I knew what the risks were.
Don't take this on.

28:53.068 --> 28:54.965
Do we have any idea
who the shooter was?

28:55.068 --> 28:56.517
I'm checking
the database right now

28:56.620 --> 28:58.137
for matching facial features.

28:58.241 --> 28:59.275
Okay.

29:04.965 --> 29:06.000
Just like that, we got a hit.

29:06.103 --> 29:08.068
- Yeah?
- Chris Wayne.

29:08.172 --> 29:10.000
Chris Wayne. I know that name.

29:10.103 --> 29:11.896
Yeah, he was busted
a couple times

29:12.000 --> 29:13.724
for selling C-4
on the black market.

29:13.827 --> 29:15.241
C-4?

29:16.551 --> 29:18.517
That must be what
Lana meant when she said

29:18.620 --> 29:20.103
these guys might blow up.

29:20.206 --> 29:21.517
So, it could be that
the briefcase Trey's delivering

29:21.620 --> 29:23.896
to Grey Flag is filled with C-4.

29:30.551 --> 29:32.896
- Hey.
- Hey.

29:33.931 --> 29:35.241
Here.

29:35.344 --> 29:36.448
Oh, thank you.

29:36.551 --> 29:38.344
Of course.

29:40.689 --> 29:43.758
You, uh... okay?

29:43.862 --> 29:45.206
Yeah, you okay?

29:45.310 --> 29:47.448
Yeah, yeah, of course. Yeah.

29:47.551 --> 29:49.344
Um, okay. Um, yeah.

29:49.448 --> 29:50.551
We're okay.

29:50.655 --> 29:52.517
I mean, in the grand
scheme of things,

29:52.620 --> 29:55.310
we are most likely
not okay as people.

29:55.413 --> 29:57.793
- Fair. Right.
- But you and I, just now?

29:57.896 --> 29:59.896
Yeah, we're good.

30:00.000 --> 30:02.103
Good.

30:03.413 --> 30:05.448
Well, look at that.
Talk about timing.

30:05.551 --> 30:07.103
I guess the files are decrypted.

30:07.206 --> 30:09.586
Want an exclusive sneak peek?

30:09.689 --> 30:12.586
I, um... I-I do, but I should

30:12.689 --> 30:15.068
probably wait to go through it
with the rest of the team.

30:15.172 --> 30:17.862
Captain's orders.
Right hand, left hand, all that.

30:17.965 --> 30:20.068
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

30:23.241 --> 30:26.000
Okay, you planning
to write an exposé?

30:26.103 --> 30:27.793
I wouldn't jeopardize your case.

30:27.896 --> 30:30.827
Maybe after you end
Grey Flag for good.

30:31.793 --> 30:32.827
It'd be one hell of a story.

30:32.931 --> 30:34.448
Yeah.

30:37.413 --> 30:39.448
Julia, um...

30:40.620 --> 30:41.896
...thanks for today.

30:42.000 --> 30:43.965
I mean, thanks for,

30:44.068 --> 30:46.620
you know, listening
to my sad truths.

30:46.724 --> 30:48.413
Don't mention it.

30:48.517 --> 30:50.379
Happy to listen and...

30:50.482 --> 30:52.068
all of it.

30:52.172 --> 30:54.827
But I bet there are
other people in your life

30:54.931 --> 30:57.862
that want to hear your
sad truths all the same.

31:00.000 --> 31:02.000
I'll see you.

31:22.965 --> 31:24.758
You made it.

31:24.862 --> 31:26.000
Cutting it close.

31:26.103 --> 31:28.000
Yeah. Well, uh,

31:28.103 --> 31:30.000
I hit the car pool lane.

31:30.103 --> 31:31.448
Something came up.

31:32.241 --> 31:35.241
- She got hit?
- Yeah.

31:37.103 --> 31:38.655
How is she even okay right now?

31:40.241 --> 31:42.103
I wondered the same thing.

31:44.482 --> 31:47.965
Barnett just came prepared,
combat gauze and all.

31:48.068 --> 31:50.965
Yeah. Uh...

31:51.068 --> 31:53.000
Once a medic,
always a medic huh?

31:53.103 --> 31:54.620
Yeah.

31:54.724 --> 31:56.344
Couldn't ask for
a better lookout.

31:59.482 --> 32:01.448
That's impressive, Barnett.

32:01.551 --> 32:03.000
The boss is gonna hear
about this.

32:03.103 --> 32:04.379
I wouldn't be surprised

32:04.482 --> 32:06.034
if you get an invite
up to the compound.

32:06.965 --> 32:08.413
We'll be in touch.

32:08.517 --> 32:10.000
Absolutely.

32:31.827 --> 32:34.000
Cass? Cassie, hey.

32:34.103 --> 32:36.034
What happened?

32:36.137 --> 32:38.655
Trey's mission went
a little off the rails.

32:38.758 --> 32:39.965
A bullet grazed me,

32:40.068 --> 32:41.413
- but I-I'm fine, seriously.
- A b...

32:41.517 --> 32:42.586
- Cap...
- Walker?

32:42.689 --> 32:44.034
I'm fine.

32:45.586 --> 32:47.310
What'd you find?

32:47.413 --> 32:48.689
Okay. All right.

32:48.793 --> 32:51.000
Well, um, uh, Julia's source

32:51.103 --> 32:52.965
dropped some files
on my old Marine unit,

32:53.068 --> 32:55.034
so if Grey Flag
is coming after me,

32:55.137 --> 32:56.413
something here
might tell us why.

32:56.517 --> 32:59.551
Okay. That's perfect.
I'll check it out.

32:59.655 --> 33:00.620
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33:00.724 --> 33:03.137
Oh, um, actually, um...

33:04.241 --> 33:06.034
Can I talk to you
about something?

33:06.137 --> 33:07.586
- Uh...
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

33:07.689 --> 33:08.586
Come on.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.241
Yeah, yeah.

33:11.068 --> 33:13.586
I just wanted to talk to you
about, um,

33:13.689 --> 33:16.068
when we went to visit
Coop's mom's house.

33:16.172 --> 33:18.586
Okay. Do you want to sit?

33:18.689 --> 33:20.551
Sure, sure. Um...

33:22.413 --> 33:24.103
So...

33:24.896 --> 33:26.689
I-I didn't...

33:26.793 --> 33:28.931
actually speak with her.

33:29.034 --> 33:30.482
I-I didn't even see her.

33:30.586 --> 33:34.344
When I was in there,
in her living room,

33:34.448 --> 33:36.482
with pictures of
Coop everywhere,

33:36.586 --> 33:38.000
I...

33:38.103 --> 33:39.965
I don't know,
I-I couldn't figure out

33:40.068 --> 33:41.241
what I could possibly say

33:41.344 --> 33:43.172
to change the facts
of what happened,

33:43.275 --> 33:45.103
so I... I left.

33:45.206 --> 33:47.655
I left the flag there.

33:47.758 --> 33:50.620
Why did you feel like
you couldn't tell me that?

33:50.724 --> 33:52.551
I think I have an idea.

33:52.655 --> 33:54.517
I think I was, um...

33:54.620 --> 33:55.689
I think I was ashamed.

33:55.793 --> 33:57.068
I...

33:57.172 --> 33:59.000
I am ashamed.

34:00.034 --> 34:02.379
- Oh.
- On...

34:02.482 --> 34:04.275
our final mission together,

34:04.379 --> 34:06.758
Coop, uh, gave an order
that separated him

34:06.862 --> 34:08.241
from the rest of the unit.

34:08.344 --> 34:10.655
I-I didn't agree with it,
but I stood down.

34:10.758 --> 34:12.965
You know, he was
my commanding officer,

34:13.068 --> 34:14.620
even though he was the one

34:14.724 --> 34:18.448
that always was
riding me to trust my gut,

34:18.551 --> 34:19.827
- I-I stood down.
- You were following orders.

34:19.931 --> 34:21.172
I get it.

34:22.379 --> 34:24.344
And when
Coop was separated from us,

34:24.448 --> 34:27.068
he held off enemy fire, um,

34:27.172 --> 34:28.310
as long as he could.

34:28.413 --> 34:31.620
And then there was an explosion.

34:31.724 --> 34:33.034
Uh...

34:33.137 --> 34:34.758
And Coop was killed.

34:34.862 --> 34:37.655
He never made it home.

34:39.275 --> 34:41.034
Which is why the flag
was so important.

34:41.137 --> 34:42.965
And I-I-I didn't tell you.

34:43.068 --> 34:44.896
I didn't know how to tell you,

34:45.000 --> 34:47.275
but I-I wanted you to know.
I want you to know.

34:47.379 --> 34:48.655
You know, same page, all that.

34:48.758 --> 34:50.068
Yeah, same page.

34:50.172 --> 34:51.965
And I know
how you feel about secrets...

34:52.068 --> 34:54.000
This is something
that you had to deal with

34:54.103 --> 34:57.000
in your own way,
in your own time.

34:58.724 --> 35:02.724
Is there anything else
you wanted to tell me?

35:02.827 --> 35:04.758
I'm sorry, Cass.

35:04.862 --> 35:06.551
No, we're good, partner.

35:11.793 --> 35:14.724
- Hi.
- There he is,
man of the hour.

35:14.827 --> 35:16.206
Hey.

35:16.310 --> 35:18.206
Excellent work, Barnett.

35:19.137 --> 35:20.586
The FBI's very happy.

35:20.689 --> 35:23.413
Thanks, but, uh, there's no need
to make a big deal of it.

35:23.517 --> 35:24.827
I mean, we barely made it

35:24.931 --> 35:26.344
- on time, so...
- Hey, hey.

35:26.448 --> 35:28.413
You saved the girl,
you made the delivery.

35:28.517 --> 35:30.724
You got the job done, okay?
It's why you're here.

35:30.827 --> 35:34.206
Yeah, well, I was just doing,
uh, what's best for the case.

35:35.482 --> 35:36.862
Wow, just take
the compliment, Trey.

35:36.965 --> 35:39.379
We're back to some good,
old-fashioned teamwork, right?

35:39.482 --> 35:40.724
Teamwork.

35:42.000 --> 35:43.310
Barnett, you good?

35:44.931 --> 35:46.206
Talk to me, man. What's up?

35:46.310 --> 35:48.413
Look, guys, I know
we got the win today,

35:48.517 --> 35:50.000
but I still have
somebody else's blood

35:50.103 --> 35:52.068
all over me.
You do see that, right?

35:52.172 --> 35:53.413
Yeah.

35:53.517 --> 35:54.862
- Look, Trey, I'm sorry--
- No, no, no, Cass.

35:54.965 --> 35:56.655
I don't even want
to hear it from you right now.

35:56.758 --> 35:59.103
What you did with the combat
gauze was extremely risky.

35:59.206 --> 36:00.517
Hell, you even got shot for it.

36:01.586 --> 36:03.068
I'm starting to realize

36:03.172 --> 36:06.103
why undercover assignments
are usually ran solo.

36:07.137 --> 36:09.551
Walker, what did you tell me?

36:09.655 --> 36:11.034
Do what's best for the case,

36:11.137 --> 36:12.448
and don't get
attached to anyone.

36:12.551 --> 36:14.206
- Right, but...
- All right, well, for me,

36:14.310 --> 36:15.862
you guys are my attachments.

36:18.517 --> 36:20.793
Guys, I need
to do this one alone.

36:26.275 --> 36:31.034
Look, at this point, it might be
the safest thing for everybody.

36:31.137 --> 36:32.137
Walker's already
keeping his distance.

36:32.241 --> 36:33.827
Cassie, you should do the same.

36:35.344 --> 36:37.000
All right, listen,

36:37.103 --> 36:39.689
I think I'm getting called up
to Grey Flag's compound.

36:39.793 --> 36:41.448
I'll gather more intel
while I'm there

36:41.551 --> 36:42.931
until this mission is complete.

36:43.034 --> 36:45.206
And I think they're prepping
for something big.

36:47.206 --> 36:50.413
Okay, if Cap thinks
this is safest,

36:50.517 --> 36:52.793
and this is what you want, Trey,

36:52.896 --> 36:54.689
then we'll respect
your decisions.

37:13.310 --> 37:15.793
Can I get a, uh,
club soda and lime, please.

37:15.896 --> 37:16.793
Thank you.

37:16.896 --> 37:18.965
Hey, Mr. Golden. Um...

37:19.068 --> 37:20.896
Hey, I just wanted
to say thank you so much

37:21.000 --> 37:22.172
for helping me help my family.

37:22.275 --> 37:23.448
They just scored
their first donation.

37:23.551 --> 37:25.068
It was, um, Happy Horse Trails.

37:25.172 --> 37:26.862
Ah, that's great news.
That's great news, August.

37:26.965 --> 37:27.862
I'm glad I could help out.

37:27.965 --> 37:30.000
Hey, between you and me,

37:30.103 --> 37:32.034
I went ahead and reached
out to my friend at TABC.

37:32.137 --> 37:34.482
We're gonna speed up
The Side Step's paperwork.

37:34.586 --> 37:36.551
Wow. Um, are you sure?

37:36.655 --> 37:38.482
My-my dad might
get upset, right?

37:38.586 --> 37:40.103
Your dad doesn't need to know.

37:41.103 --> 37:43.827
But if he does get up in arms,
he can come to me.

37:43.931 --> 37:45.379
Happy to fall on my sword.

37:45.482 --> 37:47.586
Thanks, Steve.

37:47.689 --> 37:49.344
Ah, um...

37:49.448 --> 37:51.103
Well, thank you so much.

37:51.206 --> 37:53.586
Man, you're-you're so connected.

37:53.689 --> 37:56.827
Even today, it was really cool
watching you work the room,

37:56.931 --> 37:59.517
and I'd-I'd love
to learn how to do that.

38:01.137 --> 38:02.965
Well, you can.

38:04.379 --> 38:06.448
It's a learned skill.
How about this?

38:06.551 --> 38:08.517
Why don't I swing by
the ranch sometime,

38:08.620 --> 38:10.103
help you work
on your communication?

38:10.206 --> 38:11.758
- Yeah?
- Yeah, of course.

38:11.862 --> 38:13.655
You know, self-awareness, social
skills, that kind of stuff.

38:13.758 --> 38:15.344
If memory serves,
you could use some help

38:15.448 --> 38:16.827
in that department.

38:16.931 --> 38:18.620
Well, that'd be dope, man.
I-I'd love that.

38:18.724 --> 38:20.586
Sounds good. See you then.

38:36.931 --> 38:38.172
Hmm.

38:38.275 --> 38:40.517
I think I found something.

38:40.620 --> 38:42.931
2004 drone footage.

38:43.034 --> 38:44.862
And I-I don't know
what I'm looking at here,

38:44.965 --> 38:48.965
but it matches the story
you told me, Walker.

38:49.068 --> 38:50.793
About the night Coop died.

38:53.517 --> 38:55.551
- Play it. Yeah.
- Yeah?

38:58.241 --> 39:01.758
This was just recovered
from Mossad intelligence.

39:02.896 --> 39:04.310
Now, could that have been Coop?

39:18.551 --> 39:20.000
Whoa.

39:22.862 --> 39:25.586
Wait a minute. What is that?

39:28.172 --> 39:29.206
Wait, wait, you...

39:29.310 --> 39:30.827
You don't think he...

39:30.931 --> 39:33.551
He wouldn't have
survived that, right?

39:35.448 --> 39:37.413
No.

39:37.517 --> 39:39.413
Even if he did...

39:39.517 --> 39:41.517
the injuries
he would've sustained,

39:41.620 --> 39:43.551
and being alone
in the desert like that,

39:43.655 --> 39:44.931
there's no way
he would've survived.

39:49.448 --> 39:51.344
There's no way.

40:00.448 --> 40:02.758
Man, it's nice digs we got here.

40:05.896 --> 40:08.379
I'll take you
to your barracks, Barnett.

40:08.482 --> 40:11.241
Training starts tomorrow.

40:11.344 --> 40:12.689
You ready?

40:12.793 --> 40:14.068
Tomorrow, brother, I stay ready.
