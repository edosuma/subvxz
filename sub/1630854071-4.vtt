WEBVTT

00:00.634 --> 00:01.966
(mysterious music)

00:45.212 --> 00:47.145
(old-time music, crowd cheering)

00:47.915 --> 00:49.848
(indistinct chatter)

00:54.321 --> 00:55.520
(cheering)

01:03.764 --> 01:05.196
(cheering)

01:10.905 --> 01:13.639
- This show is making people
thirsty.

01:13.641 --> 01:15.574
At this rate, we're
going to run out of liquor.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.442
- I'm glad tonight
is profitable.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.313
- Violet, you've had
a long face all night.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.414
Do you not like the show?

01:24.384 --> 01:25.517
I'm just not in the mood
for a party.

01:26.420 --> 01:27.285
- Well, the rest of toronto is.

01:28.989 --> 01:31.924
(woman): And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for...

01:31.926 --> 01:33.691
The one, the only...

01:34.328 --> 01:36.128
Nina bloom!

01:36.263 --> 01:37.663
(cheering)

01:37.665 --> 01:39.531
(big-band music)

01:40.468 --> 01:42.601
- Are we having fun tonight,
toronto?

01:42.670 --> 01:43.935
(cheering)

01:53.080 --> 01:55.547
(man): Party's over, you painted
ladies! Get out of this town!

01:55.549 --> 01:57.081
(coughing)

01:57.118 --> 01:58.083
(woman): It's a smoke bomb!

01:58.152 --> 02:00.485
- It's all right,
it's all right.

02:01.222 --> 02:02.287
(sighs)

02:02.323 --> 02:04.823
It's all right,
I've got it. Carry on!

02:04.892 --> 02:06.491
(indistinct chatter)

02:06.560 --> 02:07.359
(coughing)

02:07.494 --> 02:08.360
(clears throat)

02:08.495 --> 02:10.162
- Hit it, boys!

02:10.231 --> 02:11.230
(cheering)

02:11.365 --> 02:12.964
(big-band music)

02:18.305 --> 02:20.038
(bell ringing)

02:20.074 --> 02:21.439
- That's enough complaining.

02:21.441 --> 02:23.909
When I was your age,
I was at work before daybreak.

02:23.911 --> 02:26.244
All you two have to do is get
yourselves to school on time!

02:27.481 --> 02:28.313
(screams)

02:28.382 --> 02:29.681
(suspenseful music)

02:33.854 --> 02:35.254
- I spoke to the woman
who found him.

02:35.256 --> 02:36.588
She said there
was no one else around.

02:37.658 --> 02:38.590
- Very good, george.

02:39.760 --> 02:40.959
- I can't believe somebody
just left him like that.

02:42.329 --> 02:43.328
- Dead?

02:43.330 --> 02:44.062
- Naked.

02:45.332 --> 02:46.865
I mean, presumably
they were after his wallet,

02:46.867 --> 02:48.600
But why take all of his clothes?

02:50.270 --> 02:53.138
- But george, he was tied to a
pole, stripped naked and killed.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.407
I doubt very much this was
just about his wallet.

02:57.477 --> 02:59.277
(suspenseful music)

03:04.985 --> 03:07.219
- I would estimate some time in
the last three to seven hours.

03:08.255 --> 03:09.488
- He appears to have been
stabbed.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.424
- Indeed. A puncture wound
of a small circumference,

03:12.426 --> 03:13.491
Close to the heart.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.093
- Any other wounds?

03:16.197 --> 03:17.195
- He has abrasions
on his wrists from where

03:17.231 --> 03:18.530
He was tied to the lamp.

03:18.532 --> 03:20.765
I think he struggled
for some time before he died.

03:21.902 --> 03:23.134
That's all I can
tell you for now.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.036
- Very good, mrs. Hart.

03:25.072 --> 03:26.204
(indistinct chatter)

03:27.474 --> 03:28.373
(distant bell ringing)

03:29.576 --> 03:31.743
- Miss hamilton.
We've not seen you for a while.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.580
- It's mrs. Reddick, now.
This is my husband.

03:34.715 --> 03:35.714
- How do you do?

03:35.849 --> 03:37.382
- Inspector, I've just seen

03:37.384 --> 03:38.517
Advertisements for a burlesque

03:38.652 --> 03:40.451
Show that's to be staged
in toronto.

03:40.487 --> 03:41.686
- You don't say?

03:41.755 --> 03:42.788
- I want to know what you

03:42.923 --> 03:44.523
And your men are going
to do about it.

03:44.525 --> 03:45.590
- Honestly?

03:45.593 --> 03:47.259
There's not much
I can do about it, mrs. Reddick.

03:47.394 --> 03:49.894
- But the burlesque
is an absolute disgrace.

03:50.998 --> 03:52.664
You may recall,
I visited this station house

03:52.666 --> 03:54.666
Before to complain about
these types of shows.

03:54.801 --> 03:55.934
- How could I forget?

03:57.037 --> 03:59.204
- Our cause has been joined
by mr. Glover.

04:00.541 --> 04:03.408
- I can see why mr. Reddick
is here. What's your excuse?

04:03.543 --> 04:05.978
- Well, I've recently
moved to toronto hoping

04:06.113 --> 04:07.813
It would be a bastion
of morality.

04:07.815 --> 04:09.281
- Oh, have you now? Well,

04:09.283 --> 04:12.484
Welcome to toronto,
an excellent city where

04:12.553 --> 04:14.452
Burlesque dancing
is perfectly legal.

04:15.155 --> 04:16.120
(indistinct chatter)

04:18.558 --> 04:19.491
(ringing)

04:24.832 --> 04:26.164
- Higgins, what are you doing?

04:27.467 --> 04:28.433
- Giving miss bloom's show
some free advertising.

04:29.637 --> 04:31.169
- Your former ladylove
is causing quite the stir.

04:31.171 --> 04:32.771
- Is that right?

04:32.773 --> 04:35.173
- I've just had some do-gooders
rabbiting on at me.

04:35.175 --> 04:36.508
They want me to shut down
her show.

04:37.511 --> 04:38.710
- But, sir, I haven't
seen it yet.

04:39.913 --> 04:41.780
- Yes, well these types
are best left ignored.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.615
- Have you seen miss bloom's
show yet, crabtree?

04:45.653 --> 04:46.518
- No, I haven't, sir.
I'm a married man.

04:47.921 --> 04:50.655
- And miss bloom is a former
paramour. Too much temptation?

04:51.558 --> 04:52.590
- Hardly seems appropriate.

04:52.660 --> 04:54.059
- Well, that doesn't stop
the inspector.

04:54.762 --> 04:55.660
- Watch it, higgins.

04:57.765 --> 04:58.696
- Excuse me.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.132
Can you help?

05:02.069 --> 05:03.535
I'm looking for my husband.

05:04.638 --> 05:05.370
- How long has your husband
been missing?

05:05.505 --> 05:07.004
- Only a day.

05:07.041 --> 05:09.874
But I am embarrassed to say

05:09.910 --> 05:11.409
He may be in your cells.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.579
For public intoxication.

05:14.715 --> 05:16.881
- Ah. What's his name?

05:16.950 --> 05:18.216
- Richard hadley.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.284
- Could you describe him to us?

05:20.554 --> 05:22.887
- He was wearing a brown tweed
suit with a red tie

05:22.956 --> 05:24.723
And a blue-striped shirt.

05:25.726 --> 05:27.392
Clean-shaven, brown hair.
Spectacles.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.427
(suspenseful music)

05:28.562 --> 05:29.761
- Large mole on his left thigh?

05:29.896 --> 05:31.363
- Yes. Why?

05:41.709 --> 05:42.774
That's richard.

05:43.877 --> 05:44.675
What happened to him?!

05:45.545 --> 05:46.745
- He was found this morning.

05:47.448 --> 05:48.713
He had been stabbed.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.617
- Who would do that to him?

05:53.287 --> 05:54.218
Was he robbed?

05:55.622 --> 05:56.388
- Yes, ma'am.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.123
Of his clothes, even.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.425
- He was naked?

06:02.663 --> 06:05.397
- Mrs. Hadley, where was your
husband last night?

06:07.467 --> 06:10.669
- He always goes bowling
on thursdays at the ymca

06:10.671 --> 06:11.803
With some men from work.

06:12.606 --> 06:13.538
- Detective? A word.

06:16.744 --> 06:18.410
- Please excuse me, mrs. Hadley.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.145
Uh, take all the time you need.

06:21.815 --> 06:22.948
(sighs)

06:22.950 --> 06:24.015
(mysterious music)

06:25.352 --> 06:27.619
- Mr. Hadley had a great deal
of alcohol in his stomach.

06:28.455 --> 06:29.854
- The ymca doesn't serve liquor.

06:30.891 --> 06:32.056
- Cause of death was
a single stab wound,

06:32.092 --> 06:34.225
Directly to the heart.
He would have died in minutes.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.961
I found this in
the pulmonary valve.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.697
It's gold and has
a point at the end.

06:40.500 --> 06:41.466
- Curious weapon.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.501
- I'd guess it's half
of a hat pin.

06:44.271 --> 06:45.837
- Oh, very good.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.171
- One more thing...

06:47.207 --> 06:49.908
A stab directly to the heart
is somewhat unusual.

06:50.878 --> 06:52.377
The heart is difficult to reach.

06:53.781 --> 06:55.246
The killer would have had to
puncture the skin on the left,

06:55.282 --> 06:56.982
Between the third
and fourth rib,

06:57.117 --> 06:59.050
And then directed
the weapon towards the right.

07:00.421 --> 07:02.186
- So, the killer had to have
knowledge of human anatomy.

07:03.323 --> 07:04.655
- Or got very lucky.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.529
- Does effie know that nina
is back in town?

07:11.598 --> 07:13.665
- Higgins, I'm trying to tell
you about our honeymoon.

07:13.800 --> 07:15.233
- Yes, but does she?

07:16.403 --> 07:17.802
- I don't know.
I certainly haven't told her.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.070
Perhaps she's seen a poster.

07:20.207 --> 07:22.573
- Well, now that we're
practically brothers,

07:23.610 --> 07:24.642
I feel I have to say...

07:25.579 --> 07:26.611
I don't
think you should see nina.

07:26.647 --> 07:28.012
- Higgins, I wasn't planning...

07:29.550 --> 07:30.515
Look at this chap.

07:31.418 --> 07:32.451
What did miss hadley say?

07:32.586 --> 07:34.753
A... A tweed suit, striped
shirt, red tie?

07:34.755 --> 07:35.820
- Red tie.

07:35.823 --> 07:36.688
- Excuse me, sir!

07:36.690 --> 07:37.522
- Hm?

07:40.961 --> 07:42.093
(suspenseful music)

07:46.733 --> 07:47.966
(panting)

07:51.438 --> 07:52.570
- Sir, stop there!

07:53.306 --> 07:54.005
- Are those your clothes?

07:54.808 --> 07:56.374
- They're mine, fair and square!

07:57.377 --> 07:58.577
- Well, that's a strange thing
to say.

07:58.712 --> 07:59.644
Where did you get them?

07:59.680 --> 08:01.445
- I'm not telling!

08:02.483 --> 08:03.848
- I believe these clothes
belonged to a man

08:03.917 --> 08:04.983
Who was murdered last night.

08:05.785 --> 08:06.518
- Oh.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.186
Look,

08:08.255 --> 08:10.621
I don't know anything
about any murdered man,

08:11.792 --> 08:13.224
But I'm keeping the suit!

08:14.161 --> 08:15.126
- Turn out your pockets,
please, sir.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.194
(mumbles)

08:16.263 --> 08:17.628
- There's nothing
in the pockets!

08:18.565 --> 08:19.731
Definitely no money.

08:20.800 --> 08:22.267
Worst luck.
(chuckles)

08:22.269 --> 08:23.001
Just this.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.405
(mysterious music)
- the star bright club.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.709
- Drunk, tied naked to a post.

08:32.546 --> 08:33.411
What a way to go!

08:33.947 --> 08:34.779
- Indeed.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.549
- And how did he end up like
that after a night of bowling?

08:38.452 --> 08:40.351
- Sir, I telephoned the ymca.

08:41.488 --> 08:42.487
The bowling alley has been
closed for a month,

08:42.622 --> 08:44.656
Undergoing renovations.

08:44.791 --> 08:46.090
- So, hadley lied to his wife,

08:47.594 --> 08:49.294
His wages were burning
a hole in his pocket
and he wanted a drink.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.765
- Yes. Or it's possible
he never told his wife

08:53.767 --> 08:54.966
He was going bowling at all.

08:55.903 --> 08:57.068
- Do you think she's lying
to you?

08:57.971 --> 08:58.904
- It's possible.

08:59.039 --> 08:59.971
- Why would she do that?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.340
- I shall endeavour to find out.

09:02.842 --> 09:04.008
- Hm.

09:04.811 --> 09:06.111
- His name was richard hadley.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.914
- I'm sorry, there were a lot
of men in here last night.

09:09.917 --> 09:12.784
- Well, he was, uh,
clean-shaven, spectacles,

09:12.853 --> 09:14.919
Blue-striped shirt, red tie.

09:16.189 --> 09:16.922
(laughing)

09:17.057 --> 09:17.855
- Yes.

09:17.891 --> 09:18.923
(chuckling)

09:18.992 --> 09:20.258
I remember him now.

09:21.728 --> 09:25.129
He slapped his wage packet on
the bar and spent every penny.

09:26.366 --> 09:27.698
- Something about this chap
you found quite funny?

09:28.669 --> 09:30.134
- It depends on what
you find funny.

09:31.405 --> 09:33.805
That man was enjoying himself,
spending a lot of money,

09:33.807 --> 09:36.941
When a woman came in looking for
him. I assumed it was his wife.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.409
- What makes you say that?

09:39.513 --> 09:41.445
- Oh, I know an angry wife
when I see one.

09:42.516 --> 09:43.682
She asked for his wages.

09:43.817 --> 09:47.385
When he said they were gone,
she gave him quite a smack.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.220
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.221
- And did they leave together?

09:51.091 --> 09:52.090
- She marched out right after.

09:52.759 --> 09:53.724
He stayed a while.

09:54.294 --> 09:55.093
- Oh.

09:57.197 --> 09:58.162
- George?

09:59.366 --> 10:00.098
- Nina!

10:02.369 --> 10:03.835
(playful music)

10:03.904 --> 10:05.770
- You didn't come to my show
last night.

10:05.806 --> 10:08.372
- Well, I... I...
I wasn't sure... I didn't
know you were in town.

10:08.408 --> 10:10.307
- Well, you must have seen
the posters.

10:11.345 --> 10:12.910
Well, never mind.
You're here now.

10:13.814 --> 10:16.313
You are looking
fabulous, george.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.082
You haven't aged a day.
(scoffs)

10:19.353 --> 10:21.386
You know, it was really sweet
of you to come see me.

10:22.623 --> 10:24.122
- As a matter of fact,
I... I happen to be here on

10:24.124 --> 10:25.089
Police business.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.859
- Oh. So, you didn't come
see me at all?

10:29.296 --> 10:30.495
- Well, it... It wasn't that I
didn't want to come to see you,

10:30.630 --> 10:35.800
I was... I'm not sure how
to behave, or... Or how to be,

10:35.935 --> 10:38.336
In terms of you
and me because I'm...

10:38.405 --> 10:39.671
You know, I'm recently married.

10:40.707 --> 10:41.439
- Hm.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.374
And?

10:44.444 --> 10:46.077
- And I wasn't sure
if it was appropriate

10:46.113 --> 10:48.212
To come see somebody
who's a former...

10:49.215 --> 10:50.949
You know, and also happens
to be a...

10:51.818 --> 10:52.684
You know.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.052
Do you know? I don't know.

10:54.187 --> 10:55.353
- George...

10:55.488 --> 10:56.620
We're friends.

10:58.091 --> 10:59.958
- Of course. Of course. Yes.

11:00.093 --> 11:01.292
- Then you're coming
to our next show.

11:01.361 --> 11:02.160
- Yes.

11:02.229 --> 11:03.428
- And you're bringing your wife.

11:03.430 --> 11:04.295
- No!

11:04.364 --> 11:06.063
- I will not take no
for an answer.

11:06.667 --> 11:09.033
- No... Nina, I...

11:13.106 --> 11:15.273
- Don't worry.
She'll have the best of care.

11:17.644 --> 11:18.510
- If you would?

11:19.913 --> 11:21.579
So, how is life as
a working mother?

11:21.648 --> 11:22.447
(sighs)

11:22.516 --> 11:23.915
- Busy. But happy.

11:23.984 --> 11:25.784
- Good. Honestly, there's
so much going on around here,

11:25.919 --> 11:27.384
I'm not sure how we'd cope
without you.

11:27.421 --> 11:28.252
(chuckles)

11:28.288 --> 11:29.086
- I beg your pardon.

11:29.756 --> 11:30.955
Can you help me, please?

11:30.957 --> 11:33.758
- Yes. What can we do for you,
mrs...?

11:33.894 --> 11:34.959
- Parsons.

11:36.029 --> 11:37.862
I wasn't feeling like
myself this morning.

11:37.931 --> 11:39.130
My neighbour said
I should come...

11:39.166 --> 11:41.265
- Oh! Mrs. Parsons,
you all right?

11:42.135 --> 11:43.401
- I think I'm going to faint.

11:43.536 --> 11:44.668
- Kate, fetch some water.

11:44.705 --> 11:46.738
Let's get you through
to the examination room.

11:46.807 --> 11:47.539
(soft music)

11:47.674 --> 11:48.539
(sniffing)

11:49.976 --> 11:51.542
- She slapped her husband right
there in the star bright club?

11:51.578 --> 11:52.576
- According to miss bright.

11:53.246 --> 11:54.145
- Then she lied to us.

11:55.482 --> 11:56.748
And where's this man who was
wearing the victim's clothing?

11:56.883 --> 11:58.949
- Ah, higgins had him wait
in your office.

11:58.985 --> 11:59.784
- Very good.

12:00.620 --> 12:01.952
- Ah, sir, one other thing.

12:03.190 --> 12:05.423
Have you and the doctor ever
attended the burlesque?

12:06.393 --> 12:07.425
- No, no.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.960
Although we did
attend a performance

12:09.029 --> 12:10.361
Of the jubilee singers once

12:10.430 --> 12:12.463
That turned remarkably racy.

12:13.700 --> 12:15.633
- Right. I... It's just
that nina bloom is in town

12:15.702 --> 12:20.805
And she wants to meet effie
and she's invited us to the show

12:20.940 --> 12:22.173
And...

12:22.308 --> 12:27.378
There's so many elements
I find awkward and inappropriate

12:27.380 --> 12:29.947
About it, I...I haven't
the foggiest idea of what to do.

12:31.851 --> 12:35.786
- My advice would be
to seek counsel from
someone else, george.

12:36.322 --> 12:37.121
Shall we?

12:40.794 --> 12:42.994
- All this fuss over some
clothes?

12:43.063 --> 12:45.162
I found them!
They're mine!

12:46.399 --> 12:48.666
- The man who owns those
clothes was killed last night,

12:48.735 --> 12:49.467
Mr. Trombey.

12:51.037 --> 12:52.469
- Well, I like the suit.

12:53.306 --> 12:54.605
I wouldn't kill for it.

12:56.009 --> 12:59.210
- Mr. Trombey, I'd like to know
where you found these clothes.

13:00.614 --> 13:05.550
- I was sitting on a bench near
the clarence avenue bridge,

13:05.685 --> 13:08.153
And I saw a woman toss
a pile of clothes over

13:08.288 --> 13:09.420
Onto the tracks.

13:10.457 --> 13:12.823
So, I went down and...
And got them.

13:15.361 --> 13:16.160
Fits pretty good!

13:18.632 --> 13:20.031
- Can you describe this woman?

13:20.767 --> 13:21.599
- Slight.

13:22.369 --> 13:23.368
Blonde hair.

13:23.370 --> 13:24.502
(soft music)

13:25.238 --> 13:26.070
- That fits mrs. Hadley.

13:26.873 --> 13:28.005
- So, she lied to us.

13:29.442 --> 13:32.443
She slapped her husband
and threw his clothes
off a bridge.

13:33.380 --> 13:34.245
Bring her in, george.

13:34.281 --> 13:35.046
- Sir.

13:40.920 --> 13:41.719
- Mrs. Hadley,

13:42.722 --> 13:44.655
I understand you just lost your
husband,

13:46.827 --> 13:48.259
But you did lie to us.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.028
- I was embarrassed.

13:52.465 --> 13:55.133
I thought he had drank
so much that he got locked up.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.201
That's why I came here.

13:58.538 --> 14:00.704
But I didn't want to say
where he was drinking.

14:02.475 --> 14:04.308
- So, you knew where he went
last night?

14:04.344 --> 14:05.109
- Yes.

14:06.446 --> 14:09.147
- You went into the club
and you confronted your husband.

14:09.949 --> 14:11.549
- We're just scraping by.

14:13.687 --> 14:16.554
I couldn't believe that he would
be out buying expensive drinks

14:16.689 --> 14:17.889
When we needed that money.

14:20.126 --> 14:21.558
- What happened
after the argument?

14:22.195 --> 14:23.127
- I went home.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.498
And when I woke up,
I realized he hadn't come back.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.302
And then work called saying
he hadn't arrived for his shift.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.038
- Was anyone with you?

14:34.841 --> 14:36.507
Did anyone see you go home?

14:36.509 --> 14:38.509
- No, I... I don't think so.

14:38.545 --> 14:39.744
(suspenseful music)

14:41.648 --> 14:45.049
- I have a witness who saw
a woman throw your husband's

14:45.184 --> 14:46.985
Clothes off a bridge...

14:47.120 --> 14:49.520
A woman bearing
your description.

14:49.589 --> 14:51.823
- I don't know anything
about that.

14:52.659 --> 14:53.925
You have to believe me.

14:54.928 --> 14:55.960
(indistinct chatter)

14:57.830 --> 14:58.729
- Oh, george.

14:58.765 --> 14:59.797
- Not now, higgins.

14:59.833 --> 15:01.466
- Well, you don't know
what I was going to say.

15:01.601 --> 15:03.267
- If it's about nina,
I don't want to hear it.

15:03.336 --> 15:06.004
- It's actually about
the murder, but if you don't
want to hear it...

15:06.139 --> 15:07.204
- Well, what is it, then?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.941
- I was just speaking to stephen
at the water cooler.

15:09.943 --> 15:11.342
- This better be going
somewhere.

15:11.411 --> 15:12.944
- He just took
a trip to buffalo

15:13.079 --> 15:14.612
And he told me
that while he was there,

15:14.614 --> 15:17.215
He read a very interesting
article in the newspaper.

15:17.217 --> 15:18.082
- And?

15:18.118 --> 15:20.752
Well, a man was stripped naked

15:20.754 --> 15:22.220
And tied to a lamppost.

15:23.023 --> 15:24.489
- Really? Was he murdered?

15:25.758 --> 15:27.358
- No. But the man refused
to say who did it to him.

15:28.528 --> 15:29.793
It's strange, don't you think?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.363
- Indeed. When was this?

15:32.365 --> 15:33.564
- Two weeks ago.

15:34.968 --> 15:35.866
- Right then, higgins,

15:36.769 --> 15:37.702
See if you can find other

15:37.771 --> 15:39.570
Instances of this happening
in other cities.

15:39.572 --> 15:40.705
- Well, how will I do that?

15:40.774 --> 15:42.373
- Well, telephone
the newspapers.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.975
It's not the type of story
they're likely to forget.

15:43.977 --> 15:45.810
- Well, aren't you
going to help?

15:45.945 --> 15:47.378
- I'll help as soon as I'm back.

15:47.380 --> 15:49.447
I've got to go talk to effie.

15:49.449 --> 15:50.748
(mysterious music)

15:52.953 --> 15:53.917
- Mr. Duncan.

15:54.821 --> 15:56.054
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.389
- Gives me no pleasure to say
what I have to say to you, tom.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.157
- Oh? Please, have a seat.

16:00.226 --> 16:02.827
- I've just had mrs. Reddick
down at the board of control,

16:02.962 --> 16:06.064
Along with her husband,
though she did all the talking.

16:06.199 --> 16:08.199
- Yes, I've met her.
Several times.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.069
- She's furious about
this burlesque revue.

16:11.204 --> 16:14.072
- She's always complained
about anything to do with
liquor or dancing.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.008
I told her today as I've told
her before, it's all perfectly

16:17.077 --> 16:18.943
Legal and I won't be putting
a stop to it.

16:19.078 --> 16:20.611
- You can and you will.

16:21.914 --> 16:23.814
Mrs. Reddick said she will
not rest until these dancers

16:23.883 --> 16:25.349
Are made to stop.
And she means it.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.019
- What does it matter?
Let her complain all she wants.

16:28.154 --> 16:30.054
- She holds great sway
in the temperance movement

16:30.189 --> 16:32.289
And I can't afford to get on
their bad side.

16:32.926 --> 16:34.759
Shut it down, tom.

16:35.695 --> 16:36.527
(mysterious music)

16:39.832 --> 16:40.565
(sighs)

16:42.535 --> 16:44.502
- Mrs. Parsons, your blood
pressure's very low.

16:45.304 --> 16:46.370
- Is that bad?

16:46.373 --> 16:48.773
- Well, it's likely why you
almost fainted.

16:48.775 --> 16:50.441
We'll have
to ascertain the cause.

16:52.479 --> 16:53.911
Your heartbeat is accelerated.

16:55.114 --> 16:57.048
- I... I'm just not going back
to the hospital.

16:58.317 --> 16:59.984
- You were in the hospital
recently?

17:00.053 --> 17:01.852
- Yes. Two weeks ago.

17:03.123 --> 17:04.321
They were horrible to me.

17:05.291 --> 17:06.356
- What were you
in the hospital for?

17:07.761 --> 17:09.359
- What they call
a tubal ligation.

17:10.330 --> 17:11.929
- That's a major surgery.

17:11.965 --> 17:13.330
Have you been resting since?

17:14.467 --> 17:17.668
- How can I? I have to work,
raise my children.

17:19.105 --> 17:21.105
My husband didn't want
me getting it done,

17:21.107 --> 17:23.741
But I told him I'd get
the surgery and he wouldn't
even notice.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.742
(sighs)

17:24.877 --> 17:25.610
Ah!

17:25.745 --> 17:26.644
(groaning)
- oh.

17:28.248 --> 17:30.214
Mrs. Parsons, you're likely
suffering complications
from the surgery.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.649
It could be internal bleeding.

17:32.852 --> 17:33.650
Nurse sullivan!

17:36.156 --> 17:37.421
This woman needs surgery
immediately.

17:37.490 --> 17:38.822
Help me prepare the room.

17:38.858 --> 17:40.024
- But we can't.

17:40.093 --> 17:41.025
- There's no time.

17:42.162 --> 17:43.427
Now, kate!

17:43.430 --> 17:44.162
(suspenseful music)

17:44.964 --> 17:45.762
(sighs)

17:47.100 --> 17:49.066
- So, let me get this straight,

17:49.102 --> 17:52.837
Nina bloom has invited
us to watch her remove
her clothes?

17:52.839 --> 17:54.138
- But not all of her clothes.

17:54.808 --> 17:55.706
- Some of her clothes?

17:55.708 --> 17:57.108
- Some of her...
Most of her clothes.

17:58.177 --> 17:59.309
- And you think this
is a good idea?

17:59.345 --> 18:01.712
- I think it's about
the most uncomfortable situation

18:01.781 --> 18:02.613
I could imagine.

18:04.084 --> 18:05.783
But I didn't want
to pretend the whole
thing didn't happen and...

18:06.920 --> 18:07.718
- And?

18:09.022 --> 18:12.189
- And in an ideal world,
I would like to remain a friend

18:12.258 --> 18:14.192
Of hers and this is the way
she suggested we proceed.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.162
- Well, I hardly
mind either way.

18:18.665 --> 18:19.796
- Really?

18:19.833 --> 18:21.398
- The question is what would
you like to do?

18:21.434 --> 18:22.199
(laughter)

18:22.335 --> 18:24.001
Avoid the situation entirely.

18:24.037 --> 18:27.204
- Right. Something
that appears not to be possible.

18:28.808 --> 18:30.741
- Ah, george crabtree.
- We meet again.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.476
- Ah! Here we are.

18:32.512 --> 18:33.744
- Yes.

18:33.746 --> 18:34.946
Ah, nina....

18:35.081 --> 18:38.282
Lovely to see you. This is
effie. Effie crabtree, my wife.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.017
(laughing)

18:41.221 --> 18:42.853
- Nice to meet you.
I've heard so much about you.

18:42.856 --> 18:44.588
- Hello, mrs. Crabtree.

18:45.592 --> 18:47.891
- Nina, your former
flame is married?

18:49.996 --> 18:53.430
- I would like to introduce
you both to the outspoken

18:53.500 --> 18:58.169
Randy potts,
edie sweet and scarlett blaze,

18:58.304 --> 19:00.938
All part of nina bloom's
burlesque spectacular.

19:00.974 --> 19:02.640
- Well, lovely to meet you all.

19:03.343 --> 19:04.508
- What's it like...

19:04.577 --> 19:07.912
Knowing your husband courted
the nina bloom?

19:10.083 --> 19:11.048
- It's fine.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.783
- You're not the least
bit jealous?

19:12.819 --> 19:14.151
- Why should I be?

19:15.421 --> 19:18.055
If george crabtree is the prize,
then I am the winner.

19:18.191 --> 19:19.356
(laughing)

19:19.893 --> 19:21.058
- I like her.

19:21.094 --> 19:23.527
- Well, then it's settled,
you're coming to the show.

19:24.697 --> 19:25.896
- Well, we... We'd love to.

19:26.666 --> 19:27.531
- I'm so pleased.

19:27.600 --> 19:28.866
Until then.

19:29.869 --> 19:30.867
Ladies?

19:30.904 --> 19:31.802
(eerie music)

19:31.804 --> 19:33.537
- Yes, I told the constable

19:33.540 --> 19:34.605
That I remembered that man.

19:35.808 --> 19:37.474
- Did you see him leave
the club?

19:38.611 --> 19:40.777
- I saw his wife leave,
right after they fought.

19:42.248 --> 19:45.616
- But what about him, or anyone
else that was with him?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.486
- No. Sorry, detective.

19:49.989 --> 19:50.788
- Thank you, miss bright.

19:52.358 --> 19:56.093
- You could ask
the man that's been here
harassing me and my patrons.

19:56.963 --> 19:57.695
He was here again last night.

19:58.297 --> 19:58.896
- Who's this?

19:59.031 --> 20:00.297
- I don't know his name,

20:00.366 --> 20:02.432
But he moved into that building
across the street.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.667
- Oh.

20:04.503 --> 20:05.903
- Detective, you could also

20:06.038 --> 20:08.172
Tell him to leave me
and my club alone.

20:09.375 --> 20:10.708
(mysterious music)

20:14.581 --> 20:16.514
- Detective murdoch,
toronto constabulary.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.448
- Oh. Yes.

20:18.284 --> 20:19.650
I spoke with your inspector.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.618
Are you here to shut down that
establishment across the street?

20:22.655 --> 20:24.055
- Um...

20:24.057 --> 20:26.924
I... I'd like to ask you
if you saw a man leave the club

20:26.993 --> 20:28.692
Last night between
1 and 2 am?

20:29.829 --> 20:31.528
- Many men come
and go from that place.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.130
Absolute wastrels.

20:33.967 --> 20:34.999
Chicago was bad enough,

20:35.068 --> 20:36.467
I thought this was
toronto the good.

20:36.969 --> 20:37.735
(sighs)

20:38.471 --> 20:39.603
- Uh, this particular man

20:39.606 --> 20:43.540
Wore spectacles, had a red tie,
brown tweed suit.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.275
He was likely inebriated.

20:47.080 --> 20:49.212
- I did see a man like that,
as a matter of fact.

20:50.350 --> 20:52.083
He came out of the club
and he went that way.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.284
Ah, he was with a woman...

20:54.053 --> 20:56.086
Tall, red hair.

20:57.090 --> 20:58.955
They went
into those lodgings there,

20:58.992 --> 21:00.023
At the end of the street.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.026
(mysterious music)

21:02.762 --> 21:03.660
- Are you quite sure?

21:04.831 --> 21:06.963
The man I'm referring
to was found this morning,

21:07.000 --> 21:09.566
Having gone entirely
the opposite direction.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.302
- Oh, I'm sure.

21:14.774 --> 21:15.773
(suspenseful music)

21:17.243 --> 21:19.910
- I see two torn stitches
causing internal bleeding.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.745
- Blood pressure's
still very low.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.916
- I'm repairing
the stitches now.

21:26.786 --> 21:28.119
- This is irresponsible, julia.

21:28.254 --> 21:29.586
We're not equipped for surgery.

21:30.823 --> 21:31.989
- We had no choice.

21:32.124 --> 21:33.457
- We should have taken
her to the hospital.

21:35.128 --> 21:36.093
- There was no time.

21:38.564 --> 21:39.763
- And if we fail?

21:42.935 --> 21:43.734
- We won't.

21:51.744 --> 21:53.644
- Detective murdoch!
How are you?

21:54.380 --> 21:55.546
- Miss bloom. Hello.

21:55.615 --> 21:57.014
- My burlesque troupe
is in toronto.

21:57.016 --> 21:58.115
You should come see a show.

21:59.018 --> 22:01.485
- Ah, yes. Uh...
(clears throat)

22:01.487 --> 22:03.421
Uh, miss bloom,
I'm conducting a murder

22:03.423 --> 22:05.423
Investigation and, uh...

22:06.292 --> 22:07.892
How do I put this delicately?

22:08.027 --> 22:10.461
- No need to be delicate
around us, detective.

22:10.596 --> 22:11.328
(chuckling)

22:13.766 --> 22:15.966
- Did you or any of
your...

22:15.968 --> 22:18.769
Friends bring a man back
here last night?

22:18.904 --> 22:20.171
- Not a real man.

22:20.306 --> 22:21.438
- Randy.

22:21.507 --> 22:23.173
No, not any kind of man.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.309
We left the club together
a little after 1 am.

22:25.378 --> 22:26.176
(mysterious music)

22:27.380 --> 22:29.045
- I spoke with a witness
who says he saw the victim

22:29.082 --> 22:31.181
With a red-haired woman.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.985
- Surely I'm not the only woman
with red hair in toronto.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.355
- I'm sorry we can't
be more help, detective.

22:39.425 --> 22:40.391
We have to get
ready for our show tonight.

22:41.794 --> 22:42.793
- Of course.
- Okay.

22:42.829 --> 22:43.660
- Thank you.

22:48.067 --> 22:53.204
- San francisco, chicago,
buffalo have all had reports

22:53.339 --> 22:55.673
Of men being stripped
and tied to lampposts.

22:55.808 --> 22:56.606
- Detroit, as well.

22:56.642 --> 22:57.541
- Detroit.

22:57.577 --> 22:59.076
And, of course, toronto.

23:00.913 --> 23:02.078
Do you think it's
the same person?

23:02.782 --> 23:03.647
- Well, it's hard to say.

23:03.783 --> 23:04.748
None of the men will admit

23:04.751 --> 23:06.350
Who tied them to the lamppost.

23:06.352 --> 23:08.919
- If it is the same person,
why did they kill in toronto?

23:09.689 --> 23:10.821
- If it was the same person,

23:10.956 --> 23:13.590
Perhaps this time
they just went too far.

23:14.560 --> 23:15.292
- He could become
a sequential killer.

23:15.428 --> 23:16.627
- Or she.

23:16.696 --> 23:18.428
Remember, it was
a gold hat pin that was used

23:18.464 --> 23:19.563
As the murder weapon.

23:21.300 --> 23:22.766
- Were the men all embarrassed

23:22.835 --> 23:24.635
That a woman overcame them
and tied them up?

23:25.571 --> 23:26.570
- That could be the case.

23:26.639 --> 23:27.504
Although I've known some

23:27.573 --> 23:29.139
Particularly strong women
in my time.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.308
- You certainly have.

23:31.844 --> 23:32.643
-Higgins...

23:33.712 --> 23:34.511
Wait a minute.

23:35.248 --> 23:36.246
Give me that.

23:36.315 --> 23:38.549
- Uh, read out the-the dates
of the incidents.

23:40.386 --> 23:41.985
- Yeah, buffalo, April 18th.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.720
Columbus, April 25th.

23:43.756 --> 23:45.355
Chicago, may 6th.

23:45.425 --> 23:46.356
And toronto, may--

23:46.392 --> 23:47.257
- Higgins.

23:50.663 --> 23:51.728
We need to find the detective.

23:56.169 --> 23:57.468
- Miss bloom,
what can you tell me

23:57.603 --> 23:58.936
About the night of the murder?

23:59.005 --> 24:01.004
Because, at the moment,
all of the evidence points

24:01.040 --> 24:02.739
Towards you and your friends.

24:03.810 --> 24:04.942
- I don't know what you're
talking about.

24:06.879 --> 24:10.146
- I can tie your burlesque
troupe to a string of incidents

24:10.183 --> 24:13.016
Where men were stripped
naked and tied up.

24:16.288 --> 24:18.088
- We didn't have anything
to do with a murder.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.157
I swear on my life.

24:23.562 --> 24:24.728
- But did you know this man?

24:29.034 --> 24:30.033
(sighs)

24:30.102 --> 24:33.303
- After our shows,
if there's a fellow

24:33.372 --> 24:35.372
Who's a little too friendly,

24:35.374 --> 24:37.975
One of us pretends to be drunk.

24:38.644 --> 24:39.476
- And then what?

24:40.646 --> 24:42.913
- She takes him home,
the other women follow.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.617
If he just takes her to her door
and leaves, he's a gentleman.

24:48.721 --> 24:50.854
- And if he doesn't just leave?

24:50.890 --> 24:52.155
(eerie music)

24:52.225 --> 24:54.524
- We take him out to the street
corner, force him to undress

24:54.560 --> 24:56.193
And leave him tied
to a lamppost.

24:59.532 --> 25:01.331
- Mr. Hadley was one
of these men.

25:02.335 --> 25:04.467
And miss blaze
left the club with him?

25:05.705 --> 25:06.903
- And randy potts threw
his clothes over the bridge.

25:11.744 --> 25:14.411
- Mr. Hadley could have
overpowered any one of you.

25:14.413 --> 25:17.214
- I have a prop gun for our
cops and robbers routine.

25:17.349 --> 25:21.218
I... I used it just to scare
him a little. It doesn't work.

25:21.287 --> 25:23.253
You can see for yourself,
it's back at my room.

25:24.390 --> 25:26.122
- Miss bloom,
mr. Hadley wasn't shot.

25:27.560 --> 25:29.626
He was stabbed through
the heart with a hat pin.

25:31.196 --> 25:33.029
- I... I don't know anything
about that.

25:35.134 --> 25:37.034
We never hurt anyone.

25:37.870 --> 25:38.636
We just...

25:40.306 --> 25:43.907
We just want to embarrass
them and make them think twice

25:43.910 --> 25:45.776
Before ever being aggressive
with a lady.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.448
George. Can we talk?

25:52.051 --> 25:52.983
- Constable.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.688
Is there anything you forgot
to tell the detective this time?

25:57.690 --> 25:58.622
(phone ringing)

25:59.725 --> 26:01.891
- No, I...
I just wanted to apologize.

26:03.529 --> 26:05.796
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
how we were involved sooner.

26:05.931 --> 26:07.430
- Well, you really should have,
nina.

26:07.466 --> 26:09.065
I'm sure you know
that this makes you

26:09.101 --> 26:10.266
And your friends look guilty.

26:10.303 --> 26:12.202
- I swear to you,
we didn't hurt him.

26:13.005 --> 26:14.204
He was trying to hurt one of us.

26:15.341 --> 26:16.874
Look, george,
you don't know what it's like

26:17.009 --> 26:18.909
To always be on your guard,

26:19.044 --> 26:20.276
To know that any evening,
some man--

26:20.313 --> 26:22.779
- I appreciate that, nina,
but what you and your friends

26:22.781 --> 26:25.816
Were doing... You were playing
a very dangerous game.

26:25.818 --> 26:26.816
- I know.

26:27.787 --> 26:30.287
But, george, please
stand up for us.

26:32.024 --> 26:32.723
You know me.

26:33.926 --> 26:35.759
You know I could never
be involved in a murder.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.127
(mysterious music)

26:39.365 --> 26:41.464
- Right now I have to make sure
that you're in the cells.

26:42.401 --> 26:43.267
I'm sorry.

26:45.037 --> 26:47.171
I believe her, sir.
She had nothing to do with this.

26:47.306 --> 26:49.273
- Sounds like she was involved.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.708
She admitted as much.

26:50.843 --> 26:54.578
- Well, they tied the man
to a lamppost to humiliate him,
that's all.

26:54.647 --> 26:56.446
- That makes them all suspects.

26:56.482 --> 26:58.548
- Yes, but anything
could have happened after
they left him there.

26:59.485 --> 27:00.851
Sirs, you both know
nina bloom well.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.387
Do you honestly think she's
capable of killing a man?

27:04.991 --> 27:07.124
- Things could have changed
since we last saw miss bloom,
crabtree.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.259
The life of a travelling
burlesque dancer could make
a woman--

27:09.295 --> 27:10.460
- Into a murderer?

27:11.831 --> 27:14.330
- Into someone who might go
to extremes to protect herself.

27:14.367 --> 27:15.665
(mysterious music)

27:16.768 --> 27:17.468
(sighs)

27:18.537 --> 27:20.337
- Mrs. Parsons,
did you sleep well?

27:21.440 --> 27:22.806
- I don't know, I think so.

27:24.010 --> 27:26.876
- We had to operate
to stop the internal bleeding.

27:27.880 --> 27:29.379
- You... You saved me, doctor.

27:30.683 --> 27:33.550
- Yes, but we're not equipped
to perform surgeries here.

27:33.686 --> 27:35.218
You should have gone back
to the hospital.

27:36.622 --> 27:38.956
- At the hospital they just
poked and prodded me like I was

27:38.958 --> 27:40.090
A slab of meat on the table.

27:40.225 --> 27:41.224
(sombre music)

27:42.228 --> 27:43.694
They didn't listen
to anything I said.

27:43.696 --> 27:45.061
I'm never going back there.

27:46.232 --> 27:47.297
- You could have died.

27:47.366 --> 27:50.233
- But I didn't, thanks to you.

27:55.908 --> 27:56.640
- Cheers.

27:57.743 --> 27:58.842
- Miss bloom and her dancers
are in jail?

28:00.179 --> 28:01.845
- Until we get to the bottom
of what happened,

28:01.980 --> 28:03.113
Their show's cancelled.

28:04.116 --> 28:05.449
- Those protestors
got their wish.

28:06.785 --> 28:08.685
Maybe now they'll
leave me alone.

28:09.655 --> 28:10.887
- You ought to count yourself
lucky.

28:11.824 --> 28:12.689
They went to
the board of control.

28:12.725 --> 28:14.057
They want me to shut
this place down.

28:14.693 --> 28:15.625
- Shut me down?

28:16.895 --> 28:18.595
I should be the one bringing
charges against them!

28:19.198 --> 28:20.130
- What for?

28:20.166 --> 28:22.466
- They threw a smoke bomb
on my stage.

28:23.602 --> 28:24.935
- Why didn't you come
to the station house

28:24.937 --> 28:25.869
And file a report?

28:26.805 --> 28:27.771
- What's the point?

28:29.208 --> 28:30.607
And I didn't see who did it.

28:33.512 --> 28:34.611
Are you going to shut me down?

28:35.414 --> 28:36.680
- I'd rather not.

28:36.749 --> 28:39.916
But if the board wants you out
of business, they'll find a way.

28:41.053 --> 28:42.285
(mysterious music)

28:42.354 --> 28:44.021
You wouldn't still have
that smoke bomb, would you?

28:44.857 --> 28:45.822
- Yes, I think so.

28:47.025 --> 28:47.824
Why?

28:54.834 --> 28:55.632
- All right, george.

28:55.701 --> 28:56.767
Miss bloom said the gun was

28:56.769 --> 28:58.502
In a box near the door.

29:05.044 --> 29:06.843
- Sir, it's rusted through.

29:07.747 --> 29:08.779
Completely seized.

29:10.349 --> 29:11.548
- Very good, george.

29:11.584 --> 29:12.483
We'll bring that with us.

29:14.019 --> 29:16.253
- Sir, I can't imagine we'll
find much else of use in here.

29:16.255 --> 29:18.555
I feel like we should be out
looking for the real killer.

29:19.725 --> 29:21.458
- I know you want
to believe miss bloom, george,

29:21.460 --> 29:22.659
But let's keep looking.

29:24.396 --> 29:25.729
- What exactly
are we looking for?

29:26.599 --> 29:27.464
- We'll know when we find it.

29:40.746 --> 29:42.646
- Oh, no. Sir?

29:44.216 --> 29:45.382
- What is it, george?

29:49.755 --> 29:50.821
The other half of the hat pin.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.389
- The missing piece
of the murder weapon.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.294
- Oh, it's you lot.

29:59.698 --> 30:01.698
- I trust mr. Duncan
from the board of control
has seen you.

30:01.700 --> 30:03.299
- Indeed he has.

30:03.335 --> 30:05.569
- Then you'll shut down that
immoral nightclub immediately?

30:05.638 --> 30:07.838
- Their show has been cancelled.

30:08.874 --> 30:10.707
But don't gloat,
it's nothing you did.

30:11.844 --> 30:14.010
It's due to circumstances
beyond your control.

30:15.314 --> 30:17.947
- All the same, it's a small
step in the right direction.

30:20.018 --> 30:21.751
- What did I say
when I saw you last?

30:23.556 --> 30:24.921
- That the, uh, burlesque show

30:24.990 --> 30:27.857
Was legal,
which I find hard to believe.

30:27.893 --> 30:29.759
- I said I would look
into the matter.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.996
But when I did, I found this.

30:34.666 --> 30:35.465
(mysterious music)

30:36.669 --> 30:39.269
This was thrown onto stage
at the star bright club.

30:39.404 --> 30:41.004
Now, I'm willing to bet
one of you did it.

30:42.141 --> 30:43.006
- We would never!

30:43.075 --> 30:44.174
- Well, then you won't mind

30:44.176 --> 30:45.209
Giving me your fingermarks
to compare.

30:47.146 --> 30:49.913
Or, I'll dispose of this

30:49.915 --> 30:53.449
If you lot get out of my station
house for good. Clear?

30:54.820 --> 30:57.354
- You've just made an enemy
of mr. Duncan, inspector.

30:59.225 --> 31:00.023
Ronald!

31:01.293 --> 31:03.893
- Scarlett blaze.
Is that your real name?

31:05.097 --> 31:06.496
- It's been my name so long,
I forget any other.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.564
- ...Anything to do with this.

31:09.401 --> 31:10.868
- And this is the truth,
miss potts.

31:11.704 --> 31:12.502
- Constables,

31:13.839 --> 31:15.772
Are these women dancers
with that licentious revue?

31:16.842 --> 31:17.840
- In the flesh.

31:18.978 --> 31:20.644
- Are you both being arrested
for immorality?

31:20.646 --> 31:21.911
- Oh!

31:21.947 --> 31:24.381
Um, we're all in here
accused of murder,

31:24.516 --> 31:27.784
But they've got nothing
on any of us that'll stick.

31:27.920 --> 31:28.751
(playful music)

31:32.791 --> 31:33.590
- Miss potts.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.459
Please.

31:35.594 --> 31:37.760
Will you speak to all
the women again, sir?

31:39.064 --> 31:40.730
- They all covered for each
other and I fear they would

31:40.766 --> 31:42.732
Do the same again
and we'd be no further ahead

31:42.801 --> 31:44.868
In discovering who killed
mr. Hadley.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.538
- Well, if you don't mind, sir,
perhaps I'll call effie.

31:48.574 --> 31:49.673
Maybe she can help them.

31:49.742 --> 31:51.141
- Ah, yes, george.

31:51.276 --> 31:52.676
If they won't confess
anything further,

31:52.678 --> 31:54.144
Then I'm afraid
I can't help them.

31:54.880 --> 31:56.079
They'll all go to trial.

32:00.152 --> 32:01.351
(mysterious music)

32:02.888 --> 32:04.120
Where did this photograph
come from?

32:05.123 --> 32:06.356
- I suppose higgins
may have found it

32:06.425 --> 32:07.423
Looking into the ladies' tour.

32:14.166 --> 32:14.931
- George,

32:16.702 --> 32:17.867
Have a look at that.

32:18.470 --> 32:19.736
- The hat pin?

32:20.673 --> 32:21.938
The murder weapon.

32:23.108 --> 32:23.906
- It's identical.

32:26.545 --> 32:29.179
And it's worn by one edie sweet.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.989
- I swear to you,
I lost that hat pin in chicago.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.124
I was frantic,
it's the most expensive thing

32:41.259 --> 32:42.259
Anyone ever gave me!

32:43.362 --> 32:45.529
- If you lost it,
how did half of it end up

32:45.531 --> 32:48.465
In mr. Hadley's chest
and the other half
hidden in your room?

32:48.600 --> 32:49.932
- I'm telling you, I don't know!

32:51.337 --> 32:54.270
- You stabbed mr. Hadley
with such force

32:54.306 --> 32:55.872
The hat pin broke in half.

32:56.008 --> 32:58.908
You then pulled the jewelled
half out of his chest,

32:58.978 --> 33:01.411
Hid it in your room,
likely to pawn later.

33:01.447 --> 33:02.279
- No!

33:03.515 --> 33:06.849
I did keep it,
but I didn't stab him.

33:09.354 --> 33:10.086
I went back,

33:11.156 --> 33:13.322
After we had all left him.

33:14.827 --> 33:17.494
- You and your friends
left mr. Hadley there

33:17.563 --> 33:18.962
And he was alive?

33:20.099 --> 33:23.366
You then came back alone
and found him dead?

33:24.970 --> 33:26.369
Why did you go back to him?

33:28.240 --> 33:29.840
- I don't want to say.

33:31.710 --> 33:33.943
- Miss sweet, you are likely
going to hang for murder.

33:35.481 --> 33:38.147
Your co-operation right now
may be the only thing
that saves you.

33:40.886 --> 33:42.386
- I wanted an apology.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.321
- For him trying to force
himself on your friend?

33:46.025 --> 33:47.390
- No.

33:47.393 --> 33:48.558
Not that.

33:50.595 --> 33:51.661
- You knew him?

33:52.931 --> 33:53.930
- Years ago.

33:55.100 --> 33:55.932
We used to...

33:57.036 --> 33:58.534
Be together.

33:59.738 --> 34:00.804
He beat me.

34:02.007 --> 34:03.139
He stole from me.

34:03.175 --> 34:04.608
He was horrible.

34:06.145 --> 34:07.811
- That's why
you all targeted him.

34:11.550 --> 34:14.217
- It always feels good to give
those men what's coming to them.

34:16.555 --> 34:17.687
But with him...

34:19.491 --> 34:20.223
I wanted more.

34:21.994 --> 34:26.395
I wanted to see his humiliation
just a little bit longer.

34:28.867 --> 34:32.369
- Miss sweet, this all sounds
like very strong motive
for murder.

34:33.205 --> 34:34.237
- But I didn't kill him!

34:35.441 --> 34:36.606
He was dead.

34:37.776 --> 34:40.143
I saw the hat pin,
I panicked and I took it.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.879
(door opening)

34:44.283 --> 34:47.183
- Mrs. Crabtree.
Thank you for coming.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.385
- Of course.

34:48.387 --> 34:50.052
I'm sorry our second meeting

34:50.089 --> 34:52.489
Is under much less enjoyable
circumstances.

34:53.992 --> 34:55.525
Do you think you can
get me out of here?

34:56.995 --> 34:59.061
- Well, there's an awful lot
of evidence against you.

35:00.199 --> 35:02.431
- I just don't understand
what happened.

35:03.468 --> 35:06.336
When we left him,
he was alive and then,

35:06.471 --> 35:08.404
When I went back,
he was dead. I...

35:08.440 --> 35:11.807
- Your former lover,
killed with your hat pin.

35:11.844 --> 35:12.876
- Yes.

35:16.215 --> 35:17.614
- How do you suppose
it got there?

35:17.683 --> 35:20.183
- I don't know.
- Was it one of your friends?

35:20.319 --> 35:21.818
- No! Why would they?

35:23.088 --> 35:25.322
- Miss sweet, it's very
difficult to understand how

35:25.457 --> 35:27.657
Anyone but you could
be responsible.

35:28.460 --> 35:29.759
- Do you think I did it?

35:29.828 --> 35:32.295
- I think that a jury will
believe you did it.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.564
(phone ringing)

35:34.699 --> 35:35.899
(indistinct chatter)

35:35.968 --> 35:37.033
- Oh, henry.

35:38.437 --> 35:39.969
Good detective work today.

35:40.038 --> 35:41.972
That photograph was very useful.

35:42.107 --> 35:43.773
- Uh, what photograph, sir?

35:45.110 --> 35:46.977
- The one you left on my desk
of the burlesque dancers.

35:47.846 --> 35:48.911
- I'm sorry, sir.

35:48.947 --> 35:49.980
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:50.782 --> 35:51.948
(mysterious music)

35:53.919 --> 35:54.717
- Oh...

35:57.022 --> 35:59.122
Right, henry,
gather all of the information

35:59.257 --> 36:01.124
You have on the men
who were tied to lampposts,

36:01.126 --> 36:03.059
Give it all to george
and have him meet me

36:03.128 --> 36:04.394
In my office straight away.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.796
- Sir, I have those articles.

36:06.832 --> 36:07.730
- Ah, yes.

36:08.534 --> 36:09.733
Were you able to find anything

36:09.735 --> 36:12.135
Pertaining to
the chicago incident?

36:12.270 --> 36:13.069
- I did, sir.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.472
And that was the burlesque
troupe's last stop before coming

36:15.474 --> 36:16.940
To toronto, just last week.

36:17.743 --> 36:19.008
Right, then, listen to this.

36:19.077 --> 36:22.212
"a man was found this morning
tied to a lamppost on the corner

36:22.347 --> 36:23.947
Of fairview and carfax avenue.

36:24.016 --> 36:26.349
He identified himself
as dr. Sullivan reid

36:26.351 --> 36:28.151
Of netheredge drive.

36:28.286 --> 36:30.486
Dr. Reid refused
to say how he found himself

36:30.556 --> 36:31.421
In the predicament,

36:31.423 --> 36:32.689
Or who put him there.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.958
He also refused to comment
on the fact that he was absent

36:35.027 --> 36:36.058
A stitch of clothing."

36:37.930 --> 36:40.163
- Miss sweet maintains
that she lost the hat pin

36:40.165 --> 36:42.566
In chicago and then
it turned up here in toronto

36:42.701 --> 36:43.767
As a murder weapon.

36:43.902 --> 36:46.169
- But, sir, she had a prior
relationship with hadley.

36:46.238 --> 36:47.237
She hated him.

36:47.239 --> 36:49.005
- That could be
a terrible coincidence.

36:49.140 --> 36:51.441
- So, how does this dr. Reid

36:51.576 --> 36:53.175
From chicago figure
into the murder?

36:54.413 --> 36:56.846
- He could have taken
the hat pin, kept it with him,

36:56.915 --> 36:59.449
Travelled to toronto following
the tour dates

36:59.518 --> 37:00.516
Of the burlesque troupe,

37:00.586 --> 37:02.252
It wouldn't have been difficult,

37:02.254 --> 37:04.854
And waited for them
to find their next man.

37:06.191 --> 37:07.957
- There's no picture of him.
How will we know who he is?

37:09.060 --> 37:10.059
(soft music)

37:10.128 --> 37:11.060
- Chicago.

37:12.764 --> 37:14.230
I believe we've met him, george.

37:14.799 --> 37:15.865
Several times.

37:16.001 --> 37:17.400
- Chicago was bad enough.

37:17.535 --> 37:18.868
I thought this
was toronto the good.

37:20.138 --> 37:22.071
- Mr. Glover knew that we had
all the women in custody.

37:22.140 --> 37:24.674
- We're all in here accused
of murder,

37:24.743 --> 37:27.744
But they've got nothing
on any of us that'll stick.

37:29.114 --> 37:31.214
- Sir, he could have been
the one who put that photograph

37:31.216 --> 37:32.214
Of miss sweet on your desk.

37:33.819 --> 37:36.519
- He's the one who pointed
me in the direction of
the women's lodgings.

37:38.123 --> 37:40.290
And as he's a doctor,
he would know how to stab
a man through the heart.

37:41.559 --> 37:43.059
Release the women, george.

37:43.928 --> 37:44.761
The show must go on.

37:46.431 --> 37:47.897
- Good people of toronto!

37:48.934 --> 37:51.701
Turn away from
this den of iniquity!

37:51.770 --> 37:54.904
Shameful degenerates
have no place in our town!

37:55.040 --> 37:57.673
- Mrs. Reddick, mrs. Reddick,
what are you doing?

37:58.710 --> 37:59.576
- We are trying to make
the citizens--

37:59.711 --> 38:00.443
- Dear, please.

38:02.014 --> 38:04.313
We are doing work that you
and your men should be doing,
detective.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.051
We were told the show
tonight was cancelled,
but evidently not.

38:08.120 --> 38:09.785
- So, you're teaching
these people a lesson?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.354
- Precisely.

38:12.390 --> 38:13.723
- Is that what you were doing,
dr. Reid?

38:14.993 --> 38:16.926
- Yes, of course. We must...

38:16.928 --> 38:18.228
(suspenseful music)

38:20.799 --> 38:22.465
(indistinct chatter)

38:23.135 --> 38:24.166
- Sir, he's running!

38:29.607 --> 38:30.573
(grunting)

38:33.345 --> 38:34.543
(panting)

38:35.380 --> 38:38.280
- Dr. Reid, you're under arrest.

38:39.751 --> 38:40.616
- On your feet!

38:45.156 --> 38:46.389
- They did it to me, all right.

38:47.959 --> 38:51.094
All I was trying to do
was help one of those
ladies back to her hotel.

38:52.230 --> 38:53.329
- Are you sure that's
all you were doing?

38:54.833 --> 38:57.299
- They tied me up,
they took my clothes,

38:57.336 --> 38:58.501
And they left me there all
night.

38:58.636 --> 39:00.202
I was the laughingstock
of chicago!

39:01.540 --> 39:05.708
I lost my practice,
my wife, everything.

39:05.777 --> 39:06.976
(sombre music)

39:07.112 --> 39:10.112
- So, you took miss sweet's
hat pin that night in chicago

39:10.148 --> 39:10.914
And kept it with you?

39:12.617 --> 39:15.985
- I knew I could use
it to get revenge on at
least one of those harlots.

39:17.122 --> 39:18.855
And what better way
to do it than stab it

39:18.990 --> 39:21.857
Through the heart
of another poor schmuck
who they were gonna destroy?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.828
- You killed an innocent man
to get your revenge.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.229
- Innocent?

39:28.400 --> 39:29.665
He was at a burlesque,

39:30.735 --> 39:32.735
Pawing women
and drinking his life away.

39:33.872 --> 39:34.604
Pathetic.

39:37.442 --> 39:38.574
Just like me.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.913
(mysterious music)
