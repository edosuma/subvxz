Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! Don't
shoot! Don't shoot, please!

00:29.044 --> 00:31.851
Put the bag on the ground
and step back.

00:31.952 --> 00:34.612
Bag on the ground! Do it!

00:36.168 --> 00:38.132
Let me see your hands.
Hands up.

00:38.191 --> 00:39.685
On the ground.
Get on the ground now.

00:39.722 --> 00:42.524
- I haven't done anything.
- On the ground!

00:42.814 --> 00:45.265
Facedown. Facedown!

00:45.403 --> 00:48.749
Don't look at me.
Do it now! Come on.

00:48.873 --> 00:51.202
I haven't done anything. I...

00:51.327 --> 00:52.648
Please, I...

00:52.730 --> 00:54.218
I haven't done anything, please.

I-I...

01:30.832 --> 01:33.802
We got him.
Threat's been neutralized.

01:37.957 --> 01:39.253
Your bed is as hard as a rock.

01:39.347 --> 01:41.895
No, it's firm,
which is better for your back...

01:41.955 --> 01:43.097
And everything else.

01:43.135 --> 01:44.363
"Everything else" was great

01:44.531 --> 01:47.461
in my soft, comfortable bed
last night and this morning.

01:47.741 --> 01:49.824
Jackson: You might want
to put on some clothes.

01:49.895 --> 01:51.106
And change the subject.

01:51.135 --> 01:52.903
Since when are you so modest?

01:52.973 --> 01:55.184
Probably since I got here.

01:55.511 --> 01:56.895
Dad!

01:57.473 --> 01:59.887
Hey, Bug. Conner.

01:59.965 --> 02:02.145
Interesting philosophy
on mattresses.

02:02.204 --> 02:04.949
Sorry, sir. I... we didn't
realize you were here.

02:05.043 --> 02:06.113
Last-minute trip.

02:06.138 --> 02:07.129
Just here for a few days,

02:07.154 --> 02:09.026
and I was hoping
somebody might have some time

02:09.103 --> 02:11.246
- to join me for breakfast.
- Mm-hmm.

02:12.334 --> 02:15.707
Oh, sorry, Jax.
Just Hayes this time.

02:21.926 --> 02:23.970
I'll say it again...
that's not breakfast.

02:24.015 --> 02:25.048
What time is it?

02:25.134 --> 02:27.154
Time of consumption
does not define breakfast

02:27.216 --> 02:28.656
versus non-breakfast foods.

02:28.747 --> 02:29.968
That's where you're wrong.

02:29.997 --> 02:32.924
I issued an executive order
on my way out.

02:33.158 --> 02:36.517
My girl in charge
of this whole place?

02:37.056 --> 02:39.072
Omar Abbas?
He's a federal prisoner.

02:39.172 --> 02:40.932
He was arrested by MTA police

02:41.096 --> 02:42.603
and arraigned
by a New York City D.A.

02:42.667 --> 02:44.853
Until homeland security
and the Pentagon swooped in

02:44.917 --> 02:46.415
and declared him
an enemy combatant,

02:46.517 --> 02:48.417
allowing him to be detained
without trial.

02:48.506 --> 02:51.079
In a patently unconstitutional
stunt...

02:51.124 --> 02:53.650
debatably unconstitutional
and definitely six years ago.

02:53.697 --> 02:55.486
Why the sudden interest?

02:55.525 --> 02:58.258
Because Omar Abbas is a month
into a hunger strike.

02:58.345 --> 03:00.447
Tried to commit suicide twice.

03:00.509 --> 03:02.220
This time he might succeed.

03:02.270 --> 03:03.743
And because
an intelligence source

03:03.814 --> 03:04.969
told me he might be innocent.

03:04.993 --> 03:06.329
He was arrested with liquid Sarin

03:06.354 --> 03:07.704
in front of
a thousand witnesses.

03:07.759 --> 03:08.908
Does your source have evidence?

03:08.932 --> 03:09.890
None that they can provide

03:09.915 --> 03:12.197
without compromising
their anonymity,

03:12.242 --> 03:14.328
which is why no one I've asked
in dhs or the Pentagon

03:14.399 --> 03:15.782
is willing to reopen the case.

03:15.853 --> 03:18.118
God forbid anyone think
you're soft on terror.

03:18.204 --> 03:22.509
Lucky for Omar Abbas, you don't give
a damn about what anyone thinks.

03:22.759 --> 03:25.189
You're talking about
taking on the military,

03:25.337 --> 03:26.486
homeland security.

03:26.535 --> 03:28.626
Sounds like fun, doesn't it?

03:28.915 --> 03:31.486
My team only has five days
to work a case.

03:31.814 --> 03:34.079
Abbas hasn't had an ounce
of food in a month.

03:34.181 --> 03:36.009
Now he's refusing water.

03:36.157 --> 03:38.868
He could be dead in five days.

03:39.225 --> 03:41.055
You might be his only shot.

04:02.086 --> 04:03.438
Maxine is fine.

04:03.594 --> 04:05.852
First, it was
as New York state case,

04:05.958 --> 04:07.860
and if we can convince
a dod review board

04:07.949 --> 04:09.719
to see it
as a miscarriage of justice,

04:09.805 --> 04:11.251
then it could be again.

04:11.322 --> 04:15.063
He was caught attempting mass
murder with a chemical weapon.

04:15.114 --> 04:17.857
And thrown into solitary
confinement for six years

04:17.928 --> 04:19.360
before even being charged.

04:19.418 --> 04:20.985
Fair price
for joining al-qaeda.

04:21.053 --> 04:23.392
Allegedly. It was all
over the news, man.

04:23.605 --> 04:25.894
So was the part where prisoners
of war don't get jury trials.

04:25.918 --> 04:28.376
Timothy McVeigh declared war
against the U.S. government,

04:28.477 --> 04:30.188
launched a successful attack.

04:30.258 --> 04:32.126
He was never deemed
an enemy combatant.

04:32.251 --> 04:34.415
You see a difference?
Beyond McVeigh being white.

04:34.484 --> 04:35.954
He was executed, for one.

04:36.102 --> 04:38.147
After a trial.

04:38.251 --> 04:39.555
Ted:
These types of disagreements

04:39.614 --> 04:42.783
are what make America the
greatest country in the world.

04:43.227 --> 04:44.998

is that Omar Abbas

04:45.023 --> 04:46.571
be offered the protection

04:46.691 --> 04:48.151
of this great country's
legal system.

04:48.243 --> 04:51.172
That's where you fine folks
come in.

04:51.290 --> 04:54.555

05:02.975 --> 05:05.375

05:05.488 --> 05:07.922
Red cross have arranged
a video conference.

05:08.155 --> 05:10.493

do we have to work with?

05:10.600 --> 05:12.528
This is Omar's arrest report.

05:12.582 --> 05:14.032
This is the lab test

05:14.096 --> 05:16.063

in the duffel bag was Sarin.

is deemed classified.

06:34.160 --> 06:37.246
I was picking up a fare.

06:37.568 --> 06:40.137
When I opened my trunk,
I saw the duffel bag.

06:40.279 --> 06:43.098
The guy I dropped off a minute...

06:43.340 --> 06:46.981
Earlier forgot his bag.

06:47.345 --> 06:49.824
I grabbed the bag, tried
to find him in the station.

06:49.855 --> 06:52.238
The police checked
your meter and phone log.

06:52.345 --> 06:54.879
There's no record of the fare
you say you dropped off.

06:55.012 --> 06:56.749
I didn't put him on the meter.

06:56.863 --> 06:59.084
Sometimes I'd offer people
a flat fee

06:59.121 --> 07:01.340
if they agreed to pay cash.

07:01.659 --> 07:04.106
It wasn't right...

07:04.391 --> 07:06.332
Or legal, but...

07:06.510 --> 07:07.910
I'm not a terrorist.

after your arrest.

you're al-qaeda?

since your girlfriend's dad

07:51.639 --> 07:53.910
caught you talking

07:54.660 --> 07:57.548

I blocked it out entirely.

07:59.004 --> 08:00.481
Well, listen, um...

08:00.551 --> 08:02.762
Thank you for letting me hijack
your CIU.

08:02.903 --> 08:04.007
You're welcome.

08:04.082 --> 08:05.824
Although Hayes and I
have an understanding

08:05.882 --> 08:07.582
that she picks her own cases.

08:07.660 --> 08:09.785
And, of course,
the investigation could be good

08:09.832 --> 08:12.137
for you as well as the country.

08:12.449 --> 08:13.957
That's not why I'm okay

08:14.004 --> 08:16.309

08:16.349 --> 08:18.020
But it didn't hurt.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.684
One thing you taught me...

08:21.038 --> 08:23.004
always have an agenda.

08:23.207 --> 08:26.609
'Cause everyone else
will have theirs.

08:27.703 --> 08:31.003
So, you and Hayes
have rekindled the flame?

08:31.115 --> 08:32.823
We have.

08:33.042 --> 08:35.352
Which I hoped
you'd be happy about.

08:35.566 --> 08:37.878
Mm.

08:38.089 --> 08:40.019
I just don't see it...

08:40.057 --> 08:43.092
Working out for you two, long-term.

08:43.542 --> 08:46.245
She's a force of nature,
my daughter.

08:47.105 --> 08:49.294
Sir, Hayes
is not the same woman she was

08:49.300 --> 08:52.659
when she left Chicago
or even just a few months ago.

08:52.703 --> 08:55.011
You never
stop being an Alpha dog.

08:55.183 --> 08:58.292
And no relationship
can handle two alphas.

08:58.417 --> 08:59.980
Trust me.

09:00.409 --> 09:02.175
I know.

09:03.255 --> 09:04.940
Anyway, thanks again.

09:04.998 --> 09:06.943
Yes, sir.

09:07.652 --> 09:10.693
Maxine: Obviously, Omar Abbas
was on a terrorist watch list.

09:10.810 --> 09:12.326
I can neither confirm or deny...

09:12.404 --> 09:13.791
your team connected him
with al-qaeda

09:13.815 --> 09:15.498
within 48 hours of his arrest.

09:15.562 --> 09:17.498
That's based
on classified intelligence,

09:17.560 --> 09:20.849
- and as such, I'm not...
- I was on the job on 9/11.

09:21.065 --> 09:22.765
If this guy is connected
to Al-qaeda,

09:22.767 --> 09:26.740
I have no interest in exposing
your sources or getting him out.

09:26.935 --> 09:28.271
All I want to know is,

09:28.427 --> 09:31.787
how did you guys intercept Omar
at the train station?

09:32.115 --> 09:33.913
How did you know
what he was there to do?

09:34.123 --> 09:38.141
NSA picked up some chatter, so
we put the mta police on alert.

09:38.224 --> 09:39.787
They have
electronic chemical sniffers

09:39.875 --> 09:42.294
positioned at all major
terrorism targets in the city.

09:42.373 --> 09:43.654
I've never heard of that.

09:43.685 --> 09:45.419
And you still haven't.

09:45.591 --> 09:47.961
There were several sniffers
on the light post outside.

09:48.084 --> 09:51.263
Omar tipped the sensors
walking into the station.

09:51.857 --> 09:54.331
What about Omar's claim
that the bag wasn't his?

09:54.583 --> 09:57.951
Sarin can only be created
by trained chemists.

09:58.146 --> 10:00.334
Omar Abbas was
a... a cab driver

10:00.410 --> 10:02.210
getting a degree
in child psychology.

10:02.334 --> 10:03.374
Which is why we're certain

10:03.445 --> 10:06.005
he obtained the Sarin
from another source.

10:06.255 --> 10:07.888
Any idea who?

10:07.979 --> 10:10.552
That's what we've been trying
to find out.

10:10.779 --> 10:14.557
Until we do,
he's staying locked up.

10:20.240 --> 10:22.498
My son was not
a member of Al-qaeda.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.701
My husband is a decent man.

10:25.044 --> 10:27.005
He was studying to become
a guidance counselor

10:27.061 --> 10:28.435
so he could help children.

10:28.581 --> 10:30.724
He's never even met his own.

10:35.110 --> 10:38.173
I was pregnant
when Omar was arrested.

10:38.376 --> 10:39.976
People
who are holding your son...

10:39.977 --> 10:42.181
"holding"
doesn't even begin to describe

10:42.300 --> 10:44.478
what they've done to him.

10:44.540 --> 10:46.483
He's been imprisoned, tortured.

10:46.608 --> 10:48.378
Look at this.

10:53.189 --> 10:57.589
They won't even let him see
the sky or hear a bird,

10:57.753 --> 10:59.644
not even
for the few seconds it takes

10:59.702 --> 11:02.048
to get from a building to a car.

11:02.433 --> 11:05.502
Can you blame him
for refusing to eat?

11:05.933 --> 11:07.433
For wanting to die?

11:07.698 --> 11:09.538
That's why
we're trying to help him.

11:09.925 --> 11:13.581
My son could've gotten
a much better part-time job...

11:13.844 --> 11:15.159
Than driving a cab.

11:15.214 --> 11:16.495
But he wanted people to know

11:16.562 --> 11:20.062
that he's proud
to be a cab driver's son.

11:21.407 --> 11:23.095
Is there any possibility

11:23.120 --> 11:25.790
that someone
intentionally set Omar up?

11:25.923 --> 11:27.702
Do you know
if he had any enemies?

11:27.780 --> 11:29.422
Set him up?

11:29.427 --> 11:31.093
It's hard to believe that
he made the Sarin on his own,

11:31.117 --> 11:35.442
which means either someone gave
it to him or it was planted.

11:36.800 --> 11:38.574
Omar was liked by everyone.

11:38.645 --> 11:40.754
Sir, no one is liked by everyone.

11:40.965 --> 11:44.074
What about
other students at his college?

11:44.270 --> 11:46.421
Anybody
that was studying chemistry,

11:46.512 --> 11:49.114
someone with a grudge against him?

11:54.001 --> 11:55.481
What is it?

11:58.382 --> 12:01.309
There was someone.

12:01.659 --> 12:03.959
They didn't have a problem
with Omar.

12:04.028 --> 12:06.321
They had a problem with me.

12:12.598 --> 12:15.035
Sam: Omar may not have had
enemies, but his dad did.

12:15.074 --> 12:16.996
Nasir Mohammed.
He's a hawaladar.

12:17.098 --> 12:18.192
A what?

12:18.254 --> 12:21.129
It's basically
a black-market western union

12:21.247 --> 12:23.598
Arab communities use
to send money overseas.

12:24.089 --> 12:27.496
This guy has a record
for multiple assaults.

12:27.585 --> 12:29.985
Nasir and two of his thugs
had a financial dispute

12:30.074 --> 12:31.613
with Omar's dad, Tariq.

12:32.043 --> 12:33.549
Why would they target Omar

12:33.574 --> 12:35.582
if the issue
was with Omar's father?

12:35.637 --> 12:38.537
Tariq was supposed to be driving
the cab that day.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.863
We're looking
for Nasir Mohammed.

12:57.918 --> 12:58.988
Can I help you?

12:59.013 --> 12:59.957
We need to talk to you

12:59.982 --> 13:02.332
about your relationship
with Tariq Abbas.

13:02.696 --> 13:03.996
I don't know anyone
by that name.

13:04.021 --> 13:05.112
Really? 'Cause two
of your associates

13:05.136 --> 13:07.621
were previously arrested for
threatening and harassing him.

13:07.800 --> 13:08.969
We're not here to shut you down.

13:08.993 --> 13:10.913
We just need to know
about your dispute with him.

13:11.098 --> 13:13.153
It was a personal matter.
It's been resolved.

13:13.199 --> 13:15.160
By planting Sarin in his taxi?

13:15.246 --> 13:17.006
You're suggesting
that I was somehow involved

13:17.097 --> 13:18.426
with what happened with his son?

13:18.471 --> 13:20.486
Hawaladars are known for having
black-market connections.

13:20.510 --> 13:22.259
It would be easy for you
to get liquid Sarin.

13:22.283 --> 13:25.051
I move money. That's it.

13:25.231 --> 13:27.137
And I had nothing to do
with Omar's arrest.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.679
If you're looking
for terrorist connections,

13:28.703 --> 13:30.403
you should be talking to Tariq.

13:30.881 --> 13:32.996
His nephew Asif was radicalized.

13:33.323 --> 13:34.559
And you know this because...

13:34.592 --> 13:36.168
Asif used my service.

13:36.324 --> 13:39.621
He transferred $3,000 U.S.
to Karachi,

13:39.758 --> 13:42.207
telling me that
it was for some family friend

13:42.259 --> 13:44.159
who had fallen on hard times.

13:44.488 --> 13:47.332
A month later, I found out
the recipient was a Jihadist.

13:47.391 --> 13:48.668
He violated my trust.

13:48.720 --> 13:50.880
I could've been targeted
by homeland security.

13:50.997 --> 13:52.927
And that was the source
of your fight with Tariq.

13:52.974 --> 13:55.901
Yes.
Asif used his uncle's account.

13:55.982 --> 13:58.029
His violation
was Tariq's responsibility.

13:58.119 --> 14:00.419
And you never reported Ssif
to anyone?

14:01.529 --> 14:04.732
In my culture, you let
family deal with their own.

14:06.751 --> 14:11.189
Asif Khan, 19 at the time he
was allegedly using a hawaladar

14:11.284 --> 14:12.529
to fund terrorist activities.

14:12.628 --> 14:13.743
Can we corroborate this story?

14:13.767 --> 14:15.652
Uh, no. Hawaladars
operate under the radar.

14:15.730 --> 14:16.851
No paper trail.

14:16.856 --> 14:20.057
Not for that, but Asif did
travel to Pakistan three times

14:20.159 --> 14:22.166
in the year
leading up to Omar's arrest.

14:22.283 --> 14:24.458
Each time, he flew
from New York to Dubai,

14:24.518 --> 14:26.276
then took a local charter
to Pakistan.

14:26.339 --> 14:27.902
He didn't want anyone to know
his final destination.

14:27.926 --> 14:29.620
But looks like Omar knew.

14:29.707 --> 14:32.707
He paid for one of Ssif's
flights on his credit card.

14:32.805 --> 14:35.330
So much for no terrorist ties.
Where's Asif now?

14:35.362 --> 14:37.541
It looks like he's got
an apartment in the Bronx.

14:37.612 --> 14:40.716
You and Sam try and track him
down, get his side of the story.

14:41.682 --> 14:43.283
Got a sec?

14:44.080 --> 14:46.382
I'm checking in
on Omar Abbas' case.

14:46.432 --> 14:47.953
Any particular reason?

14:47.978 --> 14:50.041
Media found out
ciu was investigating,

14:50.137 --> 14:52.838
so now, in addition to all the
calls I'm getting from the FEDs...

14:52.877 --> 14:54.634
The press are all over you.

14:54.694 --> 14:57.030
What's that saying?
No such thing as bad publicity?

14:57.079 --> 14:59.130
This from a woman
who knows that isn't true.

14:59.155 --> 15:02.110
You having a problem
with us looking into this?

15:02.250 --> 15:06.227
No. I'm just wondering
why your dad brought it to you.

15:06.391 --> 15:08.739
Because he wants
to right a wrong.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.641
Because he loves the idea of
sticking it to the Pentagon.

15:11.734 --> 15:13.204
You sure that's all
that's going on?

15:14.501 --> 15:17.216
Whatever the reason now, I'm in.

15:18.984 --> 15:22.040
Your dad came by my office
yesterday.

15:22.121 --> 15:23.544
He doesn't think
we're gonna work out.

15:23.568 --> 15:26.602
Something about two Alpha dogs
not being a good match.

15:26.657 --> 15:30.805
You are taking relationship
advice from my dad?

15:31.454 --> 15:34.391
It didn't exactly work out
between him and your mother.

15:34.456 --> 15:37.360
We're not them.
My dad is trying to rattle you.

15:37.470 --> 15:38.954
He does this
with any guy I'm seeing.

15:38.979 --> 15:40.077
He didn't last time.

15:40.102 --> 15:43.477
Maybe this time
he senses that we're serious.

15:44.368 --> 15:45.985
Maybe.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.012
I really want to kiss you
right now.

15:48.125 --> 15:50.563
Too bad
the whole world is watching.

15:52.166 --> 15:54.016
Later, then.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.847
- Keep me posted.
- Mm-hmm.

16:01.193 --> 16:03.048
Thanks for coming in.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.602
How long have
you and Asif been roommates?

16:05.737 --> 16:06.930
About a year.

16:06.993 --> 16:08.743
When was the last time
you saw him?

16:09.360 --> 16:10.802
Last night.

16:10.930 --> 16:14.303
He left in a hurry,
and he took his prayer rug.

16:14.423 --> 16:16.055
I don't think
he's coming back soon.

16:16.157 --> 16:17.524
Any idea where he went?

16:17.577 --> 16:20.137
No. I asked,
but he wouldn't tell me.

16:20.333 --> 16:22.352
He seemed pretty freaked out.

16:23.746 --> 16:25.626
I brought his journal...

16:25.926 --> 16:28.186
In case it might help you
track him down.

16:30.055 --> 16:32.118
What is this, Arabic?

16:32.259 --> 16:34.251
Urdu, I'm guessing.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.469
Can you...

16:35.494 --> 16:38.251
- Translate?
- No, I was born in the Bronx.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.243
Looks like a terrorist camp.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.782
Is that Omar
with his cousin, Asif?

16:45.905 --> 16:47.945
They were working together.

16:54.079 --> 16:55.890
<i>That photo was taken
a long time ago.</i>

16:55.938 --> 16:57.583
These men are on
the most wanted terrorist list,

16:57.584 --> 16:58.720
and that's you
standing next to them.

16:58.744 --> 17:00.945
- <i>I can explain.</i>
- Did they provide you with the Sarin?

17:01.020 --> 17:02.922
<i>No.</i> Because if you're
protecting a terrorist.

17:02.966 --> 17:05.203
<i>I... Asif was troubled.</i>

17:05.414 --> 17:07.500
<i>After 9/11, he was assaulted.</i>

17:07.561 --> 17:10.164
<i>People called him a terrorist.
He was angry, frustrated.</i>

17:10.262 --> 17:13.258
<i>Decided if he was gonna be
labeled that way anyway...</i>

17:14.579 --> 17:16.305
<i>He stole my credit card,</i>

17:16.455 --> 17:18.790
<i>used it to buy a plane ticket
to Karachi.</i>

17:18.938 --> 17:20.348
Well, that explains
what he's doing there.

17:20.373 --> 17:21.586
What about <i> you?</i>

17:21.703 --> 17:23.944
<i>I went to bring him home.</i>

17:24.088 --> 17:27.258
<i>Save him.</i>

17:27.713 --> 17:29.983
<i>I had to pretend
I wanted Jihad, too.</i>

17:29.984 --> 17:31.852
<i>It was the only way
I could get Asif out.</i>

17:31.955 --> 17:33.995
That's gonna be hard to prove,
even if it's tr...

17:35.388 --> 17:36.988
- Omar?
- <i>Call the medic!</i>

17:37.144 --> 17:38.508
Omar!

17:48.680 --> 17:51.078
Is Omar going to be okay?

17:51.151 --> 17:53.758
I don't even know
who to ask for a status update.

17:53.814 --> 17:56.820
Low thiamine levels probably
sent his body into shock.

17:56.993 --> 17:58.453
He's being force-fed
through a tube now.

17:58.477 --> 17:59.766
That's protocol.

17:59.814 --> 18:02.172
He started the hunger strike
so he could gain some control.

18:02.264 --> 18:03.534
Now he's lost it again.

18:03.789 --> 18:05.333
What about his story?

18:05.358 --> 18:06.625
Are we really buying

18:06.701 --> 18:09.000
Omar went to Pakistan
to rescue his cousin?

18:09.090 --> 18:10.832
Flying halfway around the world
to infiltrate a terrorist cell?

18:10.856 --> 18:12.826
Seems well beyond
the call of duty.

18:12.913 --> 18:15.410
You know,
when I got out of prison,

18:15.460 --> 18:18.260
my cousin was in deep
with my old gang.

18:18.381 --> 18:19.906
I was on parole,

18:19.996 --> 18:22.426
so getting anywhere near them
was a violation.

18:22.451 --> 18:24.383
I could've ended up back inside

18:24.485 --> 18:26.875
or in serious trouble
if the gang realized

18:26.922 --> 18:28.461
I was trying to pull him out.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.857
So I crashed a few parties.

18:30.938 --> 18:32.789
I managed to talk
some sense into him

18:32.817 --> 18:34.985
before they ruined his life.

18:35.227 --> 18:36.735
I buy Omar's story.

18:36.899 --> 18:39.362
We need to find Asif,
see if he confirms it.

18:41.037 --> 18:42.305
I talked to his roommate
this morning.

18:42.306 --> 18:43.602
Still no sign of him.

18:43.695 --> 18:45.789
I think I know
how to track him down.

18:49.891 --> 18:51.281
Hayes.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.016
Agent Cole sexton,
agent maeda from DHS.

18:54.061 --> 18:56.367
You guys buy those suits
in bulk?

18:56.703 --> 18:59.219
I'm looking for Omar's cousin,
Asif Khan.

18:59.221 --> 19:01.430
I'm guessing the dhs
has him under surveillance,

19:01.461 --> 19:03.291
given his flirtation
with terrorism.

19:03.399 --> 19:06.477
CIU's investigation
on Omar Abbas is over.

19:06.608 --> 19:08.578
Drop the case.

19:08.914 --> 19:10.336
Why would I do that?

19:10.367 --> 19:13.274
Because Omar was caught
red-handed with liquid Sarin.

19:13.375 --> 19:15.438
And we corroborated
both his ties to Al-qaeda

19:15.508 --> 19:17.258
and his plan
to attack the train station.

19:17.308 --> 19:20.000
With whom?
A confidential informant.

19:20.057 --> 19:23.102
Okay. So put me in contact
with this informant,

19:23.188 --> 19:25.430
and I will corroborate
the corroboration.

19:25.516 --> 19:27.814
Omar was put away
in accordance with the law.

19:27.953 --> 19:30.274
I don't need to show you
any proof,

19:30.353 --> 19:32.781
and I'm not about to
expose our source.

19:33.130 --> 19:35.030
Shut it down.

19:39.731 --> 19:41.501
Thank you for your support.

19:41.595 --> 19:44.336
Hayes, the evidence
is completely against Omar.

19:44.441 --> 19:46.784
What evidence? The evidence the
feds refuse to share with us?

19:46.808 --> 19:48.820
They have a c.I.
With whom I need to speak.

19:48.864 --> 19:51.194
Sexton's never going to give you access.
Doesn't matter.

19:51.271 --> 19:53.618
Omar's connection to al-qaeda
comes through his cousin, Asif.

19:53.642 --> 19:55.670
We find Asif,
he gives us the c.I.

20:01.697 --> 20:03.820
Frankie: This man used his credit
card in here the other day.

20:03.844 --> 20:05.094
You recognize him?

20:05.121 --> 20:06.320
Sorry. Can't help you.

20:06.389 --> 20:08.031
Might help
if you looked at the photo.

20:08.056 --> 20:09.867
I doubt it.
I don't help cops.

20:10.055 --> 20:11.914
I look like a cop to you, man?

20:14.516 --> 20:15.610
No, but you act like one.

20:15.695 --> 20:17.019
We're from D.A.'S office,

20:17.020 --> 20:18.780
and actually, we're trying to
help someone get out of jail.

20:18.788 --> 20:20.418
So you can put someone else in?

20:20.423 --> 20:21.953
Only if they were involved

20:21.958 --> 20:24.288
in a Sarin attack at the train
station six years ago.

20:24.294 --> 20:25.624
I remember that.

20:25.628 --> 20:26.788
So you'll help us, then.

20:26.796 --> 20:28.664
No.

20:28.665 --> 20:29.936
You want to order some food,
let me know.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.979
You want to see me naked?

20:33.096 --> 20:35.948
Already have.
Paparazzi pics from nice.

20:36.135 --> 20:37.385
Like I don't know who you are.

20:37.473 --> 20:38.862
Those were just topless.

20:38.948 --> 20:40.508
I'm talking about
the ones from Italy.

20:40.565 --> 20:42.221
<i>Spiaggi di guvano.</i>

20:42.293 --> 20:45.666
You tell us something we don't already
know, I'll give you the website.

20:52.654 --> 20:54.054
He came in twice yesterday.

20:54.057 --> 20:56.157
He paid cash for lunch
and used the card for dinner.

20:56.219 --> 20:57.359
That's all I got.

20:57.445 --> 20:58.565
First, you want to make sure

20:58.594 --> 21:01.000
you have an antivirus program
installed on your computer,

21:01.025 --> 21:02.238
and then you go to ww...

21:02.263 --> 21:05.263
it's all right.
I've seen those already, too.

21:05.711 --> 21:08.383
She's cool. You're not.

21:09.765 --> 21:12.234
Asif must be hiding out
somewhere nearby.

21:12.320 --> 21:14.738
Why else would anyone eat here
twice in one day?

21:14.828 --> 21:16.937
There's a crappy motel
around the corner.

21:20.165 --> 21:22.935
The clerk said he's in room 309.

21:27.664 --> 21:28.955
Housekeeping.

21:29.031 --> 21:30.325
Asif: I said
I didn't want service today.

21:30.326 --> 21:32.561
Housekeeping, sir.
We just need to take trash out.

21:32.562 --> 21:33.432
It... it's fine.
It's fine.

21:33.433 --> 21:35.195
Housekeeping.
Damn it.

21:38.742 --> 21:41.929
Why you running, Asif?
We're just trying to help.

21:43.272 --> 21:45.859
When I heard someone was asking
around about my cousin,

21:45.984 --> 21:47.238
I got scared.

21:47.243 --> 21:48.976
You didn't want the CIU
to uncover the truth,

21:49.000 --> 21:50.445
that you're the terrorist,
not your cousin.

21:50.469 --> 21:51.773
No. That's...

21:51.820 --> 21:53.059
we're trying to find the informant

21:53.083 --> 21:54.975
who put your cousin away.

21:56.670 --> 21:58.459
That's me.

21:58.621 --> 22:00.998
I'm the one
who informed on Omar.

22:12.606 --> 22:15.067
I'm not saying anything else.
I should've never told you that!

22:15.131 --> 22:17.091
We're not going anywhere, Asif.

22:17.168 --> 22:19.129
We can wait.
What'll it be? Porn?

22:19.207 --> 22:21.676
"Fast and furious 17"?

22:21.936 --> 22:24.883
I only informed on Omar because
I didn't have any other choice.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.270
And what's that
supposed to mean?

22:26.349 --> 22:28.942
Please tell us the truth.

22:32.494 --> 22:34.141
After Omar was arrested...

22:34.423 --> 22:37.267
Some men grabbed me
off the street.

22:37.387 --> 22:39.494
Who?
The Hawaladar's enforcers?

22:39.587 --> 22:40.587
No.

22:40.673 --> 22:42.564
No, they were government agents.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.345
I'm pretty sure they were the
same ones who picked up Omar.

22:44.369 --> 22:45.465
What did they want from you?

22:45.489 --> 22:48.447
They were convinced that I'd
helped Omar plan the attack

22:48.498 --> 22:49.775
even though I kept telling them

22:49.800 --> 22:52.298
there was no plan, no attack,

22:52.533 --> 22:54.892
that my cousin
wasn't a terrorist.

22:55.238 --> 22:58.564
They wouldn't stop asking
the same questions...

22:58.845 --> 23:00.520
About where Omar got the Sarin,

23:00.569 --> 23:03.072
was it from the man
on the 911 call...

23:03.267 --> 23:05.072
What 911 call?

23:05.148 --> 23:07.306
They played it over and over.

23:07.462 --> 23:10.226
There was a man saying
there was Sarin in a duffel bag

23:10.251 --> 23:12.540
- in the trunk of a taxi cab.
- Did you recognize his voice?

23:12.564 --> 23:14.853
No,
but they wouldn't believe me.

23:14.947 --> 23:18.775
They said I could disappear
and no one would ever know.

23:18.923 --> 23:20.342
They held me there for days.

23:20.367 --> 23:21.806
They wouldn't let me sleep,

23:21.831 --> 23:23.531
barely gave me
any food or water.

23:23.533 --> 23:24.933
They tortured you.

23:24.934 --> 23:27.939
I thought I was gonna die.
I had to get out of there.

23:28.228 --> 23:30.773
I told them
what they wanted to hear.

23:31.033 --> 23:34.048
That Omar was Al-qaeda...

23:34.210 --> 23:36.940
And he planned to release
the Sarin in the train station.

23:38.908 --> 23:40.704
It was the only way
they would stop.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.017
Torture... cruel and ineffective.

23:43.119 --> 23:44.382
My cousin saved me

23:44.431 --> 23:46.627
when he pulled me
from that terrorist camp.

23:46.915 --> 23:48.822
In return...

23:49.440 --> 23:51.978
I ruined his life.

23:52.454 --> 23:54.228
He's never even met
his daughter.

23:54.287 --> 23:56.213
Well, this is your chance
to fix it,

23:56.399 --> 23:58.439
but we need you
to tell your story.

23:58.509 --> 23:59.869
No. No, I... I can't.

23:59.962 --> 24:02.819
Asif, I took Omar's case because
my father asked me to.

24:02.906 --> 24:04.134
He'll protect you.

24:04.219 --> 24:06.525
And now even the media
are paying attention.

24:06.767 --> 24:08.787
But you need to be brave.

24:08.900 --> 24:11.141
Your cousin could die
if you're not.

24:13.315 --> 24:16.181
Madam Chairperson, in light of
Asif Khan's appearance

24:16.211 --> 24:18.712
here today to recant
his original testimony...

24:18.796 --> 24:20.306
woman: Testimony
implicating Mr. Abbas

24:20.423 --> 24:22.767
in planning a mass-casualty
attack in New York City.

24:22.824 --> 24:25.462
A statement made under duress
after days of torture.

24:25.539 --> 24:26.796
Man: Enhanced interrogation,

24:26.930 --> 24:28.971
which is permissible
under the laws of this country.

24:29.012 --> 24:31.415
Just because it's legal doesn't
make it any less inhumane.

24:31.494 --> 24:32.969
Watch yourself, Ms. Morrison.

24:32.994 --> 24:34.673
I will do that, ma'am.

24:34.783 --> 24:36.525
Who is watching all of you?

24:36.606 --> 24:37.736
Respectfully,

24:37.814 --> 24:39.986
Omar Abbas was arrested
in New York City,

24:40.087 --> 24:42.939
but he was never charged
or allowed to stand trial.

24:43.056 --> 24:44.548
The people of New York

24:44.573 --> 24:46.698
deserve the opportunity to hold
him accountable for his crimes.

24:46.722 --> 24:50.806
Omar Abbas is rotting away in
a military facility in Virginia.

24:50.962 --> 24:52.486
He is being kept alive

24:52.522 --> 24:54.822
by being fed through a tube
forced up his nose

24:54.892 --> 24:56.165
because he's given up hope.

24:56.204 --> 24:57.283
And I don't blame him.

24:57.308 --> 24:59.110
He's never stood trial,
he's never been charged...

24:59.134 --> 25:01.079
as happens
with enemy combatants.

25:01.173 --> 25:03.845
He's an American citizen,
arrested on American soil,

25:03.908 --> 25:05.933
not that any human being
deserves to be treated this...

25:05.957 --> 25:08.978
it is our understanding that the
detainee still has not divulged

25:09.081 --> 25:12.142
any information about where
he acquired the chemical agent.

25:12.259 --> 25:14.379
That assumes he's guilty,
which has never been proven.

25:14.447 --> 25:17.079
Actually, it has,
by Asif Khan's signed affidavit.

25:17.147 --> 25:18.223
Which he recanted.

25:18.259 --> 25:19.847
Can your witness prove

25:19.908 --> 25:22.103
that the Sarin found
in Omar Abbas' possession

25:22.150 --> 25:23.283
didn't belong to him?

25:23.308 --> 25:25.110
- No, but...
- Or that he's not lying right now

25:25.134 --> 25:27.125
to try and exonerate his cousin?

25:27.150 --> 25:28.736
He made a sworn statement.

25:28.814 --> 25:31.422
Your request for Mr. Abbas'
immediate release is denied.

25:31.447 --> 25:32.468
He'll face trial

25:32.493 --> 25:34.728
when the justice department's
investigation is complete.

25:34.798 --> 25:36.165
How long is that gonna take?

25:36.275 --> 25:37.822
As long as we need it to.

25:38.001 --> 25:40.431
The security of the country
is at stake.

25:44.345 --> 25:46.009
The federal review board
shut us down,

25:46.034 --> 25:48.102
- leaving us with one option.
- Which is?

25:48.143 --> 25:50.252
Prove Omar wasn't trying to
carry out a terrorist attack,

25:50.276 --> 25:51.766
which means finding the person

25:51.791 --> 25:53.806
that left the duffel bag
of Sarin in the cab.

25:53.893 --> 25:55.293
So, essentially do in two days

25:55.318 --> 25:57.128
what the feds couldn't do
in six years?

25:57.193 --> 25:59.690
We need to get ahold of the
911 call that Asif mentioned,

25:59.792 --> 26:00.822
the one about the Sarin.

26:00.823 --> 26:01.597
Whoever made that call

26:01.622 --> 26:04.073
was either responsible
for the attack or knows who is.

26:04.151 --> 26:05.643
I already checked with NYPD.

26:05.745 --> 26:07.262
Call didn't go to 911 dispatch.

26:07.323 --> 26:08.663
Well, if it didn't go through 911,

26:08.665 --> 26:10.253
then it had to go
to the dhs tip line.

26:10.331 --> 26:12.815
You mean that "if you see
something, say something" number

26:12.878 --> 26:14.362
on billboards?

26:14.573 --> 26:17.370
We're never gonna get our hands
on that recording.

26:17.581 --> 26:19.151
I may have a way.

26:27.849 --> 26:29.418
I can't help you, Max.

26:29.419 --> 26:31.086
Seriously, Reese?

26:31.111 --> 26:33.368
After my dad helped you
get assigned to the 127th

26:33.414 --> 26:34.814
after we graduated
from the academy?

26:34.844 --> 26:37.055
I can't help you because I
couldn't find any information

26:37.110 --> 26:38.680
in the DHS phone logs.

26:38.946 --> 26:40.571
Well, maybe our witness lied.

26:40.625 --> 26:43.008
I didn't say that.
I'm gonna show you something.

26:43.070 --> 26:45.031
You don't get to take it with
you, you can't take a picture...

26:45.055 --> 26:47.634
I'll take a peek
and forget where I saw it.

26:47.870 --> 26:49.504
The record for the time
you asked me about

26:49.528 --> 26:52.407
shows no call coming in about
a terror threat or Sarin.

26:52.555 --> 26:55.118
But a call entry around
that time was deleted.

26:55.266 --> 26:56.388
Deleted, meaning...

26:56.477 --> 26:57.615
The recording's missing,

26:57.711 --> 27:00.594
along with all the details about
the number it came in from.

27:00.726 --> 27:01.952
Whatever's on that call,

27:01.993 --> 27:04.571
someone's making sure
you don't find it.

27:07.458 --> 27:08.938
You really made these, Jax?

27:09.039 --> 27:11.469
- Yes. Sure did.
- Dad, I need a minute.

27:11.524 --> 27:13.602
Uh, uh, can it...
can it wait a minute, Bug?

27:13.627 --> 27:14.507
We... we have company.

27:14.532 --> 27:16.327
Have one of your brother's
shrimp toasts.

27:16.352 --> 27:19.680
Mm. Uh! It's about Omar Abbas.

27:19.902 --> 27:21.562
I'll be right back.

27:21.649 --> 27:23.282
Hey, tell him how you wrangled
that committee seat

27:23.306 --> 27:24.736
for your mother.

27:25.141 --> 27:27.649
It all started with
shrimp toast just like this.

27:29.174 --> 27:32.444
Hayes: The dod review board
turned down our appeal

27:32.515 --> 27:35.071
even though their main witness
recanted his testimony.

27:35.184 --> 27:37.071
I need to talk to your source.

27:37.493 --> 27:38.407
A tip was called in.

27:38.492 --> 27:40.130
That's how MTA
knew about the Sarin.

27:40.327 --> 27:42.250
I'm sorry.
I have to stay out of this.

27:42.287 --> 27:44.196
This is our only chance
to free Omar.

27:44.266 --> 27:46.336
Hayes, you know,
I can't reveal my source.

27:46.430 --> 27:47.969
Use the resources at your disposal.

27:48.008 --> 27:49.844
What resources?

27:50.258 --> 27:52.211
Redacted files?
Anonymous sources?

27:52.301 --> 27:53.851
You... you'll meddle
with my personal life,

27:53.875 --> 27:55.219
you'll take a shot
at Wallace and me,

27:55.243 --> 27:56.141
but you won't help me with this?

27:56.200 --> 27:58.610
Bug, settle down. We have guests.

27:59.914 --> 28:01.799
You didn't expect me to succeed.

28:01.841 --> 28:03.821
You <i> never</i> expected me
to succeed.

28:03.946 --> 28:05.203
That's ridiculous.

28:05.264 --> 28:07.344
Wallace asked me why you pushed
me to take this case.

28:07.440 --> 28:09.670
I thought he was being paranoid.

28:10.141 --> 28:12.154
Whatever your agenda...

28:12.336 --> 28:13.696
It's been satisfied.

28:13.743 --> 28:16.532
CIU took the case,
now the media knows about it.

28:16.675 --> 28:19.575
You don't care
whether Omar lives or dies.

28:19.805 --> 28:23.125
But, hey,
as long as it's a win for you.

28:47.422 --> 28:50.062
- You expecting company?
- No.

29:00.702 --> 29:03.008
What is it?

29:07.961 --> 29:10.618
It's the missing call log
from the terror tip line.

29:10.925 --> 29:12.725
Looks like you made a friend.

29:24.135 --> 29:25.723
This was left in the elevator?

29:25.840 --> 29:27.609
It's the missing DHS call log.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.690
You see this right here?
Time stamp 4:35 P.M.,

29:29.774 --> 29:30.974
lasting 58 seconds?

29:31.100 --> 29:32.354
This is the call

29:32.379 --> 29:35.190
that was deleted from the log
I "didn't see" yesterday.

29:35.215 --> 29:35.987
That must be the call

29:36.012 --> 29:38.042
warning about the Sarin
being in Omar's cab.

29:38.108 --> 29:39.384
We need to find out
who placed it.

29:39.408 --> 29:41.112
I looked into the envelope
the log came in.

29:41.176 --> 29:42.909
Made by Minoso Paper Company...

29:43.018 --> 29:45.475
available in any office-supply
store on the East Coast.

29:45.526 --> 29:48.057
- No fingerprints, no DNA.
- So a total bust.

29:48.100 --> 29:49.925
Whoever left that info for you
in the elevator

29:49.950 --> 29:51.349
didn't want it
traced back to them.

29:51.454 --> 29:52.641
Well, luckily, they gave us
enough to figure out

29:52.665 --> 29:54.225
where the anonymous tip
was placed from.

29:54.295 --> 29:56.677
City directory says it's a pay
phone in the financial district.

29:56.701 --> 29:57.762
They still have those?

29:57.787 --> 29:59.224
In 2011, they did.

29:59.420 --> 30:01.467
This call
came from the courtyard

30:01.492 --> 30:03.529
at the Galloway bank
corporate headquarters.

30:03.678 --> 30:04.858
A bank... that's perfect.

30:04.917 --> 30:06.414
They should have plenty
of security footage.

30:06.438 --> 30:08.967
But not archived
six years later, Bug.

30:10.529 --> 30:12.662
Uh, we will have to
go back to Omar

30:12.701 --> 30:13.795
and see if this new information

30:13.819 --> 30:16.014
will help him remember
some of his old fares.

30:16.098 --> 30:19.108
Sam, you call me "Bug" again,
I'll take your legs off.

30:22.103 --> 30:24.608
<i>Every other day now,
they strap me to a chair,</i>

30:24.772 --> 30:26.154
<i>put a tube up my nose.</i>

30:26.194 --> 30:28.545
Omar, we have a lead
on whoever informed the police

30:28.584 --> 30:30.251
about the Sarin in your cab.

30:30.334 --> 30:31.561
The person who made the call

30:31.624 --> 30:34.740
did it from a pay phone outside
a Galloway Bank on Broad Street.

30:34.931 --> 30:36.261
<i>That was six years ago.</i>

30:36.381 --> 30:38.873
We checked your credit-card
transactions from that day.

30:38.950 --> 30:41.021
None of those passengers
were picked up or dropped off

30:41.045 --> 30:41.963
near that location.

30:42.037 --> 30:44.240
Do you remember
anyone who paid cash

30:44.309 --> 30:46.584
that you might have dropped off
in that area?

30:49.144 --> 30:52.743
Try and think back.
Fall 2011.

30:53.048 --> 30:55.064
<i>I tried to avoid
the financial district.</i>

30:55.095 --> 30:57.259
<i>Traffic was so terrible,
all the protests.</i>

30:57.361 --> 30:58.790
Occupy wall street.

30:58.939 --> 31:01.017
<i>That's right.</i>

31:01.673 --> 31:03.827
<i>Now, I dropped
one young man off around there.</i>

31:03.853 --> 31:07.829
<i>He was, uh, white,
early 20s, short blond hair,</i>

31:07.907 --> 31:08.947
<i>wore a baseball cap.</i>

31:09.040 --> 31:11.095
Mets, Yankees,
or something useful?

31:11.165 --> 31:12.901
<i>From a college, I think.</i>

31:12.986 --> 31:14.202
<i>I remember him because...</i>

31:14.275 --> 31:15.555
<i>because I tried
to turn him down,</i>

31:15.589 --> 31:18.189
<i>but he offered five times
the meter to go downtown.</i>

31:18.361 --> 31:21.322
<i>For that money, I was... I was
fine to sit in traffic.</i>

31:21.347 --> 31:23.822
Any chance this young man left
a duffel bag in your trunk?

31:23.931 --> 31:25.361
<i>Yeah, possibly.</i>

31:25.548 --> 31:28.048
<i>When it's too cold,
I... I pop the trunk</i>

31:28.134 --> 31:30.587
<i>and let the passengers
load and unload for themselves.</i>

31:30.806 --> 31:33.572
Hang in there, Omar.
We'll follow up on this.

31:35.126 --> 31:37.579
If the feds are monitoring
Omar's communications,

31:37.642 --> 31:39.363
they'll know we're closing in
on a suspect.

31:39.400 --> 31:40.501
Which can't make them happy.

31:40.525 --> 31:42.079
We need to find this college kid
before they do.

31:42.103 --> 31:44.799
Or they'll make him disappear
before we get to talk to him,

31:44.923 --> 31:47.123
and Omar will stay locked up.

31:51.307 --> 31:53.307
You kept files
on the protestors?

31:53.439 --> 31:55.200
It must've been a headache
for you and your team.

31:55.224 --> 31:56.418
I don't know what's worse...

31:56.471 --> 31:58.345
a snot-nosed kid calling me
a fascist

31:58.346 --> 31:59.564
every day that you come to work

31:59.588 --> 32:02.260
or having to sit and listen
to that drum circle all day.

32:02.330 --> 32:04.900
Any of these kids seem capable
of doing some real damage?

32:05.018 --> 32:07.222
Which one of those punks wasn't?

32:07.322 --> 32:09.533
30 of them stormed the lobby
that morning.

32:09.634 --> 32:11.486
In the afternoon,
it was quiet, though,

32:11.549 --> 32:12.971
because they were all arrested

32:13.025 --> 32:15.838
and cooling their heels
at the tombs.

32:15.965 --> 32:17.908
I don't see our clean-cut
college kid anywhere.

32:18.010 --> 32:20.122
Is there any chance
someone else was here that day,

32:20.213 --> 32:21.436
someone that didn't fit the part?

32:21.437 --> 32:23.471
Hmm.

32:23.822 --> 32:26.221
Hey, wait a minute.
There was this one guy.

32:26.263 --> 32:29.252
I caught him throwing eggs at
the employees a week earlier.

32:29.439 --> 32:31.463
And we had to run him off,
though.

32:31.666 --> 32:33.082
What did this guy look like?

32:33.197 --> 32:35.383
Like him, minus 10 years.

32:35.533 --> 32:37.084
But we haven't seen him since.

32:37.158 --> 32:41.135
Probably gone back to get his
bachelor's degree in Macrame.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.590
College kids, right? You
got a picture of this guy?

32:43.728 --> 32:44.963
Uh, yeah, sure.

32:44.988 --> 32:48.197
Ever since 9/11, we keep
all troublemakers on file.

32:50.338 --> 32:51.846
That's him right there.

32:51.993 --> 32:53.377
This guy got a name?

32:55.135 --> 32:56.547
Paul Sedgewick.

32:56.596 --> 32:58.924
Thank you.
Let's go.

32:59.268 --> 33:00.971
Thank you, Emilio, for your help.

33:01.081 --> 33:03.981
Yeah. It's, uh, my pleasure.

33:04.313 --> 33:06.243
We appreciate
you coming down here, Paul.

33:06.301 --> 33:07.537
We're reviewing
an arrest that was made

33:07.561 --> 33:10.278
during the occupy wall street
protests a few years back.

33:10.418 --> 33:12.285
A lot of those charges filed
against us protestors

33:12.309 --> 33:13.520
were bogus.

33:13.628 --> 33:14.770
Are you saying you didn't assault

33:14.794 --> 33:16.746
a 47-year-old mother of two
with an egg?

33:16.957 --> 33:18.707
I was aiming for her boss.

33:18.864 --> 33:20.504
Gandhi would be proud.

33:20.606 --> 33:23.139
You're not a big fan
of Galloway Bank, huh, Paul?

33:23.140 --> 33:24.371
Why would I be?

33:24.454 --> 33:26.754
They wiped out my parents'
pension, took away their home.

33:26.865 --> 33:28.387
I had to drop out of college.

33:28.467 --> 33:32.145
My dad came out of retirement
to pay the bills.

33:32.334 --> 33:35.278
Then he had a heart attack
working a double shift.

33:35.574 --> 33:38.110
He died on the factory floor.

33:38.309 --> 33:40.582
Before you dropped out,
you were premed, right?

33:40.607 --> 33:41.660
Yes.

33:41.685 --> 33:42.699
And after your dad died,

33:42.741 --> 33:46.035
you went back and majored
in chemical engineering.

33:47.989 --> 33:49.223
So what?

33:49.278 --> 33:50.732
That's the kind of thing
that comes in handy

33:50.756 --> 33:53.895
when you want to make a
chemical agent, say, like Sarin.

34:00.835 --> 34:03.735
I'm done talking to you
without a lawyer.

34:10.245 --> 34:12.385
You can't leave.
I'm not under arrest.

34:12.438 --> 34:14.626
What happened, Paul? Did you get
cold feet when you got to the bank?

34:14.650 --> 34:16.197
Leave the Sarin in the taxi?

34:16.253 --> 34:18.666
You called the authorities because you
didn't want innocent people to get hurt.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.159
Well, someone did get hurt...
Omar Abbas.

34:21.273 --> 34:23.065
I don't have to tell you
anything.

34:23.090 --> 34:25.346
You don't want to leave, Paul.

34:25.418 --> 34:27.620
We have every reason to believe
the FEDs are onto you by now.

34:27.643 --> 34:29.444
And believe me,
you'd rather talk to us.

34:29.500 --> 34:31.525
Just ask Omar Abbas.

34:35.062 --> 34:37.161
Just who we're here to see.

34:44.079 --> 34:45.748
Is that
Omar's co-conspirator?

34:45.837 --> 34:48.632
You have done nothing
but keep my unit in the dark.

34:48.806 --> 34:50.376
Now I have to be transparent with you?

34:50.440 --> 34:51.985
So he is?

34:52.204 --> 34:53.524
No.

34:53.679 --> 34:55.726
Sedgewick planned the attack alone.

34:55.804 --> 34:57.493
His target
was the Galloway bank,

34:57.594 --> 34:58.829
but you all zeroed in on Omar

34:58.883 --> 35:00.274
because he looked
like a terrorist.

35:00.337 --> 35:02.016
Meanwhile,
the real criminal got away.

35:02.069 --> 35:03.602
This might change that.

35:04.024 --> 35:05.529
It's the audio recording

35:05.571 --> 35:08.469
of the tip about the Sarin
being in Omar's cab.

35:10.188 --> 35:11.866
We've been looking for this.

35:11.954 --> 35:13.313
I had no idea.

35:13.423 --> 35:16.196
Because you're
my father's source.

35:16.378 --> 35:18.540
You knew that Omar was locked up

35:18.594 --> 35:20.774
based on
Asif's coerced testimony.

35:20.844 --> 35:23.469
You confided in my father
that he might be innocent,

35:23.649 --> 35:26.704
then leaked the pay-phone number
when you knew I hit a dead end.

35:27.789 --> 35:30.938
You've got five minutes before
we take him into custody.

35:31.047 --> 35:32.735
Make them count.

35:33.161 --> 35:34.766
Paul:
<i>Pay attention. This is real.</i>

35:34.813 --> 35:36.563
<i>There's a cab in lower Manhattan</i>

35:36.602 --> 35:37.735
<i>with liquid Sarin in it.</i>

35:37.736 --> 35:39.463
<i>It's in a duffel bag.</i>

35:39.468 --> 35:41.508
<i>You're running out of time.</i>

35:41.626 --> 35:43.685
I think that's more than enough
for a voice match, don't you?

35:43.709 --> 35:45.810
Absolutely.
In fact, Homeland Security

35:45.873 --> 35:47.568
is tracing the Sarin
right back to you now,

35:47.717 --> 35:50.178
finding the chemical components
you bought to make it.

35:50.256 --> 35:51.826
Talk to us while you can.

35:51.959 --> 35:55.224
The more people that know
your story, the better for you.

36:02.967 --> 36:04.754
When I got to the bank,

36:04.974 --> 36:08.790
I saw that it was crawling
with protestors.

36:08.998 --> 36:10.818
And once I bailed on the attack,

36:10.864 --> 36:14.178
I realized that other people
could get hurt.

36:14.506 --> 36:17.076
That's why I called
about the Sarin.

36:17.240 --> 36:22.037
I didn't mean
for somebody else to get blamed.

36:26.548 --> 36:29.051
The review board will convene
an emergency session

36:29.076 --> 36:30.181
tomorrow morning in Washington.

36:30.186 --> 36:31.834
In light of recent developments,

36:31.904 --> 36:33.537
we'd appreciate
if you backed our motion

36:33.607 --> 36:35.701
to release Omar Abbas immediately.

36:35.795 --> 36:37.576
Since you've
conclusively demonstrated

36:37.628 --> 36:39.615
he's not a threat
to our nation's security...

36:39.678 --> 36:41.060
He never was.

36:41.217 --> 36:42.731
We'll support
your recommendation

36:42.787 --> 36:44.568
under one condition.

36:44.725 --> 36:47.107
That Omar's investigation
remain classified.

36:47.201 --> 36:49.334
Like hell.
The man's rights were violated.

36:49.406 --> 36:52.006
It's in everyone's interest
for Omar to be released

36:52.056 --> 36:54.646
with as little fanfare
as possible.

36:56.049 --> 36:58.037
Sounds reasonable enough.

37:00.172 --> 37:01.803
Take the win.

37:12.732 --> 37:15.154
Your father
is a great humanitarian.

37:15.301 --> 37:18.529
Even done quietly,
this will make that clear.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.412
The right people will know.

37:24.508 --> 37:26.326
The right people?

37:26.638 --> 37:29.037
There's an opening at the U.N.

37:29.269 --> 37:31.439
Secretary General.

37:45.661 --> 37:47.748
Welcome home.

38:05.572 --> 38:08.812
You're more beautiful
than I imagined.

38:21.163 --> 38:22.398
You did it.

38:22.553 --> 38:24.624
Sure did.

38:25.102 --> 38:27.874
You should've told me
about your U.N. Position.

38:28.014 --> 38:29.600
What does it matter?

38:29.702 --> 38:31.606
This man is free because of you.

38:31.678 --> 38:33.408
And because you wanted a new job.

38:33.410 --> 38:35.580
An important one.
I'll be good at it.

38:35.631 --> 38:37.068
Why couldn't you
just be honest with me?

38:37.092 --> 38:39.319
Why is there always
an agenda with you?

38:39.577 --> 38:42.233
That's not just me, Bug.
That's everyone.

38:42.342 --> 38:43.428
That's Wallace.

38:43.453 --> 38:45.467
Okay, dad.

38:45.835 --> 38:48.286
You have no idea
about our relationship.

38:48.374 --> 38:49.621
I love him.

38:49.663 --> 38:52.303
I know you do.
And he loves you, too.

38:52.436 --> 38:55.959
But part of what he loves about
you is that you're my daughter.

38:56.124 --> 38:58.296
You were raised
in a political family,

38:58.374 --> 39:01.967
you have power, access,
all the things he never had.

39:02.272 --> 39:03.694
Why would you say that?

39:03.807 --> 39:06.256
You've always been big
on the truth.

39:07.550 --> 39:09.919
You're wrong about him.

39:10.108 --> 39:13.448
Okay.
But how will you ever know?

39:22.267 --> 39:24.306
Wallace: That was amazing.

39:24.681 --> 39:25.728
You're amazing.

39:25.796 --> 39:27.908
Now you're exaggerating.

39:29.263 --> 39:31.728
Hayes Morrison,
champion of the underdog.

39:31.855 --> 39:34.142
Who else could've actually
pulled that off?

39:34.348 --> 39:36.322
This demands a celebration.

39:36.452 --> 39:39.299
And not just this case...
everything.

39:39.470 --> 39:42.197
CIU, your mom's win,

39:42.321 --> 39:44.791
my beating
the U.S. Attorney.

39:45.000 --> 39:48.430
And us, of course.

39:57.861 --> 39:59.478
Sorry.
What were you saying?

39:59.577 --> 40:01.544
To us.
