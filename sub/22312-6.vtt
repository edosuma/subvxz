And you're also getting
very good at basketball...

14:35.666 --> 14:37.001
I am!

14:37.084 --> 14:41.046
But being good at something doesn't
mean you should brag about it.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.008
I'm not bragging.

14:44.091 --> 14:47.469
I can't help it if my flying skills
make me the best at everything.

14:47.553 --> 14:49.329
But it's important to remember that

14:49.336 --> 14:51.771
everyone has something they're good at.

14:51.849 --> 14:54.518
And all of your friends
have special skills too.

Well, speaking of special skills, it's

I'm not doing any more races! Ever!

18:08.337 --> 18:12.549
What's the matter, Drac? I thought
you liked racing with your friends.

18:13.509 --> 18:14.843
I did,

18:14.927 --> 18:18.597
but that was before my flying failed
and everybody had to rescue me.

18:20.224 --> 18:23.102
Cleo used her wind power
to untangle me from the net.

18:23.185 --> 18:26.605
And Lobo's speed helped him to
catch me when I was stuck in the tire

18:26.688 --> 18:30.109
and then Zoe, Frankie and Katya
had to use their superpowers

18:30.192 --> 18:31.985
to rescue me from the tree branch.

are all pretty special.

better than being the best flyer.

made them decide they

don't want to be my friends anymore?
