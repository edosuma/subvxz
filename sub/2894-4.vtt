WEBVTT

00:00.700 --> 00:02.100
(people screaming)

00:02.102 --> 00:04.803
Man: Look out!
(crashing)

00:04.971 --> 00:06.104
(growls)

00:06.106 --> 00:08.840
(grunts)

00:08.975 --> 00:11.710
Ulik, you are
not welcome here.

00:11.712 --> 00:14.513
Where did a troll like you
get such a weapon of asgard?

00:14.515 --> 00:18.083
I think you've more
pressing concerns, odinson.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.990
(rumbling)

00:25.691 --> 00:27.893
Ulik: Hmph.
What damage
have you done?

00:27.895 --> 00:30.162
You'll soon find out.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.566
Not again.

00:34.568 --> 00:36.535
(grunts)

00:42.642 --> 00:44.776
Prepare for your demise.

00:45.978 --> 00:48.780
Long have I waited
for this day!

00:48.782 --> 00:50.449
(repulsor ray firing)
(groans)

00:53.019 --> 00:54.686
Iron man:
Mind if I crash the party?

00:54.688 --> 00:56.888
Running a scan
on your playmate, thor.

00:56.890 --> 00:59.958
One second
and I'll know exactly how
we should deal with...

00:59.960 --> 01:02.494
Thor:
<i>He is not of earth.</i>

01:02.496 --> 01:05.464
<i>Even worse for you,</i>
<i>there is magic involved.</i>

01:05.465 --> 01:09.167
To me it's just science
I haven't figured out yet.

01:12.839 --> 01:14.005
(yells)

01:14.007 --> 01:15.574
(grunts)

01:18.010 --> 01:19.578
(growls)

01:19.580 --> 01:22.914
Have at thee,
prince of asgard.

01:26.185 --> 01:28.520
Home run!

01:28.522 --> 01:30.055
(roars)

01:30.057 --> 01:31.490
(coughing)

01:35.728 --> 01:37.195
He is down.

01:37.197 --> 01:38.897
There is a much more
pressing concern.

01:38.899 --> 01:41.500
I know, I know.
Lost asgardian battle ax.

01:42.068 --> 01:44.002
Is this bad?
Very.

01:44.004 --> 01:46.605
Ulik's arrival
from the underworld
is one thing.

01:46.607 --> 01:49.608
His use of that weapon
reveals a terrible truth.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.577
An ancient legend that
does not bode well for me.

01:52.579 --> 01:55.180
Which legend
are you referring to?

01:55.182 --> 01:58.250
The only one that has ever
mattered to me, my friend.

01:58.252 --> 02:00.252
For on this day,

02:00.254 --> 02:02.988
I may be destined to perish.

02:04.000 --> 02:10.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.540 --> 02:21.940
(thudding)

02:28.848 --> 02:29.915
Where is it?

02:29.917 --> 02:31.917
We must find ulik's weapon.

02:31.919 --> 02:34.953
Unfortunately, it stinks
of your brand of science,

02:34.955 --> 02:37.789
Which is keeping my onboards
from getting a fix on it.

02:37.791 --> 02:39.724
Tell me more
about this legend.

02:39.726 --> 02:41.826
Why is the ax
so important?

02:41.828 --> 02:43.562
It cannot remain lost.

02:43.564 --> 02:45.030
If it falls into
the wrong hands,

02:45.032 --> 02:47.933
That weapon could mean
the end of the world.

02:47.935 --> 02:50.101
Okay. Fine.
Let's head back
to the tower.

02:50.103 --> 02:54.072
I can rig something
that will search
a lot better than we can.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.241
(humming)

03:00.814 --> 03:04.115
Inform skull that we've
secured the object.

03:10.923 --> 03:12.591
(rapid firing)

03:13.960 --> 03:16.027
<i>Engaging latverian hostiles.</i>

03:20.032 --> 03:22.267
<i>Go, go. Go!</i>
<i>(glass shattering)</i>

03:25.938 --> 03:27.339
Cap: How's the prisoner?

03:27.341 --> 03:29.975
So far, he's
the ideal house guest.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.710
Ulik, is it?

03:31.712 --> 03:33.011
To what do we owe
the pleasure?

03:33.613 --> 03:35.347
Ask the odinson.

03:35.781 --> 03:38.350
My hatred of you
knows no bounds.

03:38.352 --> 03:41.319
So I came here to see
if the legend was true.

03:41.321 --> 03:45.023
(inaudible)
and score another point
for the so-called legend.

03:45.257 --> 03:46.858
Fortunately,
I'm the kind of guy

03:46.860 --> 03:48.927
That doesn't let
his friends go so easily.

03:48.929 --> 03:50.929
Let's hit
the datacrux.

03:53.899 --> 03:56.001
Thor:
This waiting is intolerable.

03:56.335 --> 03:58.336
Listen, I'm using
everything I've got

03:58.338 --> 03:59.838
To find ulik's
missing weapon.

03:59.840 --> 04:02.907
Thor, your life
is up to you.
Not a legend.

04:02.909 --> 04:05.010
Each of us has a path
that is fated to him.

04:05.012 --> 04:08.079
This is mine.
I do not expect you
to believe.

04:08.214 --> 04:10.181
Sorry, I don't do well
with cryptic.

04:10.183 --> 04:11.950
In the meantime,
I think I've localized

04:11.952 --> 04:13.918
The specific frequency
that was causing

04:13.920 --> 04:17.022
So much interference
when I tried to scan ulik.

04:17.356 --> 04:19.190
You found it?
You betcha.

04:19.192 --> 04:22.227
Now, let's see
which beach
we're storming today.

04:22.762 --> 04:23.962
Uh-oh.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.964
Cap: That's
the latverian embassy.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.699
That means...
(thor grunts)

04:27.867 --> 04:29.134
Thor: Latveria.

04:29.136 --> 04:31.369
So doom possesses
this weapon?

04:32.338 --> 04:33.772
I'm gonna bill you
for that.

04:35.241 --> 04:37.776
Why do I think
there's something
about this legend

04:37.778 --> 04:39.744
Thor isn't telling us?

04:44.283 --> 04:46.451
Red skull:  <i>Von doom,</i>
<i>you have usurped</i>

04:46.453 --> 04:48.887
<i>An artifact that is</i>
<i>rightfully mine.</i>

04:48.889 --> 04:52.424
It would seem
you are mistaken,
"iron skull."

04:52.858 --> 04:54.926
The ax-hammer is mine.

04:54.928 --> 04:57.162
I sent a squadron
of agents to retrieve it.

04:57.164 --> 05:00.699
They became victims
of your accursed doom dogs.

05:00.701 --> 05:02.934
Yes. A tragedy.

05:02.936 --> 05:07.138
But the war
for world supremacy
demands casualties.

05:07.306 --> 05:11.476
This weapon serves
a purpose that only I
can properly utilize.

05:11.911 --> 05:13.945
And so I shall.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.815
We have both heard
the legend of its purpose,

05:16.817 --> 05:20.118
<i>But you are tampering</i>
<i>with forces you cannot</i>
<i>possibly control.</i>

05:20.120 --> 05:21.786
<i>Only together could we...</i>

05:21.788 --> 05:24.889
I am through
hearing your
pathetic sales pitch

05:24.891 --> 05:27.492
For this so-called
cabal, skull.

05:27.893 --> 05:29.928
This conversation...

05:29.930 --> 05:32.030
(shattering)
...Is over.

05:32.398 --> 05:35.066
And my own ascension

05:35.068 --> 05:37.102
Has begun.

05:38.003 --> 05:39.370
Iron man:
Time to call the play.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.272
I've got everyone's
task assigned.

05:41.274 --> 05:43.808
Please tell me it's me
detonating an
explosive arrow

05:43.810 --> 05:45.376
Right under
doom's throne.

05:45.378 --> 05:47.278
There is no time
to waste, archer.

05:47.280 --> 05:49.948
We must retrieve this weapon
before more damage is done.

05:49.950 --> 05:52.050
I'm already
bored here.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.952
Don't drag
your knuckles yet, hulk.

05:53.954 --> 05:58.757
Iron man's right.
Any move on the latverian
embassy has to be handled

05:58.759 --> 06:00.792
With a sizable degree
of delicacy.

06:00.960 --> 06:03.461
Falcon, hawkeye,
you're our recon team.

06:03.463 --> 06:07.232
We need to get as much
boots on the ground intel
as possi...

06:07.234 --> 06:09.000
(grunts)

06:09.002 --> 06:11.469
Our two big guns
just flew the coop.

06:13.839 --> 06:15.140
Not a bad plan.

06:15.142 --> 06:17.041
This is no game, brute.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.977
The weapon is our
primary objective.

06:18.979 --> 06:21.179
Who cares about that?

06:21.181 --> 06:23.081
I just wanna smash.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.484
Iron man: Falcon,
you're air cover.
Falcon: Got it.

06:26.486 --> 06:28.453
What're the odds
doom's on vacation?

06:28.455 --> 06:29.921
Cap: We ever been that lucky?

06:29.923 --> 06:31.055
Iron man: Nope.

06:36.428 --> 06:37.929
This is barton.

06:37.931 --> 06:39.197
I'm under the embassy.

06:43.068 --> 06:44.135
(mechanical whirring)

06:55.014 --> 06:55.914
(powering down)

06:55.916 --> 06:57.949
(distant thudding)

06:57.951 --> 06:59.250
Uh-oh.

06:59.252 --> 07:01.452
You are trespassing.

07:06.959 --> 07:07.992
(grunts)

07:14.066 --> 07:15.567
I think that's
the last of them.

07:15.569 --> 07:16.935
So what's next?

07:16.937 --> 07:18.269
Do we just go inside?

07:18.271 --> 07:20.939
Yeah. Find me
something else to hit.

07:20.941 --> 07:22.373
(rumbling)
hmm?

07:24.043 --> 07:26.945
You dare trespass
on latverian soil?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.613
Is that it?
Thor: Yes.

07:28.615 --> 07:31.015
Its power rivals
that of mjolnir.

07:31.150 --> 07:32.884
So you do possess it.

07:32.886 --> 07:35.153
How dare you carry
a weapon of asgard!

07:35.155 --> 07:37.222
You want it back?

07:37.224 --> 07:39.290
Come and get it.

07:39.292 --> 07:40.491
(yells)

07:47.967 --> 07:49.500
(hulk groans)

07:50.369 --> 07:52.370
Iron man:
New battle plan, avengers.

07:53.005 --> 07:55.473
Doom's power levels
are suddenly off the charts.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.509
Missed.
Falcon?

07:58.511 --> 08:00.912
I'm on it.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.413
How'd he do that?

08:02.415 --> 08:04.115
That's a thor trick.

08:05.050 --> 08:06.618
(gasps)

08:07.453 --> 08:09.087
(grunts)
what enchantment

08:09.089 --> 08:11.189
Could this
mortal despot possess?

08:11.191 --> 08:12.891
It's not
enchantment, thor.

08:12.893 --> 08:14.626
He's modified it
with doomtech.

08:14.628 --> 08:17.896
Thor: Modified or not,
its true purpose remains.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.164
Indeed it does.

08:21.033 --> 08:22.100
(all groan)

08:24.003 --> 08:27.572
(people screaming)

08:27.574 --> 08:29.073
Man 1: Look out!
Man 2: Whoa!

08:29.075 --> 08:30.942
You dare not tamper
with legends

08:30.944 --> 08:37.081
Too late. That which you fear
the most is on its way.
(distant roaring)

08:37.082 --> 08:39.082
Iron man: Falcon, recon.

08:39.985 --> 08:42.153
Falcon: I really don't
wanna know what thor fears.

08:42.354 --> 08:43.922
(explosion)
(screaming)

08:43.924 --> 08:45.056
Uh...

08:51.563 --> 08:52.697
Iron man: That would be...

08:52.699 --> 08:55.066
The midgard serpent.

08:55.068 --> 08:57.035
The end of all things.

08:57.037 --> 08:58.469
(roars)

09:04.376 --> 09:06.344
(people screaming)

09:06.645 --> 09:08.613
(roars)

09:19.558 --> 09:22.193
Getting a scan
on our new playmate.

09:22.594 --> 09:26.164
Is it just me,
or is this thing
actually getting bigger?

09:26.465 --> 09:30.068
Once unleashed,
the serpent will increase
in size and mass,

09:30.070 --> 09:32.570
<i>Until it is large enough</i>
<i>to feast on the earth itself.</i>

09:32.572 --> 09:33.738
Falcon:
Wait a minute.

09:33.740 --> 09:35.473
He's gonna swallow
the entire planet?

09:35.475 --> 09:37.241
Isn't that
what I just said?

09:37.243 --> 09:39.477
Cap: This was ulik's plan
all along, wasn't it?

09:39.479 --> 09:45.116
Thor: I am the only one
who can defeat
the midgard serpent.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.151
At the cost
of my own life.

09:47.153 --> 09:49.454
Come on, thor.
It's just another
big lizard.

09:49.456 --> 09:52.557
We got more than enough muscle
to send it back to the swamps.

09:52.559 --> 09:54.158
Yeah, we do.

09:54.160 --> 09:57.195
No snake is gonna swallow
goldilocks while I'm around.

09:58.464 --> 09:59.697
(roars)
hulk, no!

09:59.699 --> 10:01.366
(growls)

10:04.603 --> 10:06.604
(yells)

10:07.506 --> 10:09.240
Okay.

10:09.242 --> 10:11.509
I'd like to amend
my earlier statement.

10:20.252 --> 10:21.619
(hissing)

10:21.621 --> 10:24.789
You are mine, serpent.
(roars)

10:25.524 --> 10:27.425
Doom is your master!

10:28.527 --> 10:30.595
(roars)

10:37.603 --> 10:39.137
(grunts)

10:39.139 --> 10:40.638
Did I miss anything?

10:42.174 --> 10:43.474
(crowd clamoring)
I'll take that as a yes.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.143
(crowd screaming)

10:49.715 --> 10:52.550
Out for a few minutes,
and things turn into
a disaster movie.

10:52.552 --> 10:55.686
Hawkeye, we need to get
these civilians to safety.

10:57.623 --> 11:00.491
Falcon, obviously
we're short a big gun.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.726
A big green one.

11:01.728 --> 11:04.595
Go find him.
Bring him back here asap.

11:04.597 --> 11:06.330
I'm on it.

11:07.666 --> 11:09.500
You have fought well.

11:09.502 --> 11:12.570
If all that I am
is to be ended on this day.

11:12.572 --> 11:15.640
Not exactly a win
by avenger standards,
is it?

11:15.642 --> 11:19.744
If I must fall
so the serpent falls,
then so be it.

11:19.746 --> 11:20.845
Thor!

11:22.514 --> 11:25.550
Soon you will be
my weapon, beast.

11:25.552 --> 11:29.320
The rest of the world
will bow before me!

11:29.322 --> 11:32.857
No force on earth
can contain
the serpent, doom!

11:33.525 --> 11:35.560
We shall see.

11:36.528 --> 11:38.262
(yells)

11:40.499 --> 11:41.833
(explosion)

11:49.241 --> 11:50.608
(panting)

11:52.744 --> 11:54.212
(straining)

11:58.450 --> 12:01.319
(falcon chuckling)
pretty easy to map
hulk's trajectory.

12:01.321 --> 12:02.887
(siren wailing
in the distance)

12:04.423 --> 12:05.723
Up and at 'em, greenie.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.425
Come on, big guy.

12:07.626 --> 12:11.629
Man, I am not giving you
mouth-to-mouth, got it?

12:12.431 --> 12:14.866
(sighs) okay, falc,
time to prove it.

12:15.567 --> 12:18.236
(straining) come on.

12:19.605 --> 12:21.405
(people laughing)

12:35.220 --> 12:36.554
Hope this works.

12:36.556 --> 12:37.889
(grunts)

12:46.566 --> 12:50.668
You'd better have
a really good reason
for doing that.

12:52.472 --> 12:56.774
And I'm the only one
who can turn it
to my advantage.

12:57.376 --> 12:59.477
No, you're the only one
foolish enough

12:59.479 --> 13:02.547
To think you can control
a force you don't understand.

13:02.681 --> 13:04.649
(both grunting)

13:05.517 --> 13:08.219
You two can argue
mythology later.

13:08.221 --> 13:13.691
Of an enormous lizard
doing his own renovations
on the manhattan skyline.

13:13.693 --> 13:16.827
Dr. Doom:
Only I have the power
to tame the serpent

13:17.329 --> 13:18.829
And make it my slave.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.531
Well, that's
a great plan.

13:20.533 --> 13:21.699
And impossible.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.501
No mere mortal can control.

13:23.503 --> 13:24.835
(screams)

13:24.837 --> 13:26.370
(roaring)

13:28.640 --> 13:31.475
Thor, there's got to be
a better way here.

13:31.477 --> 13:34.245
Only by sacrificing
myself to the serpent

13:34.247 --> 13:35.947
Can the earth be saved.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.648
No. I don't accept that.

13:37.783 --> 13:39.650
The legend
cannot be denied.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.519
Iron man:
This is no time for...

13:41.521 --> 13:46.390
It is doom whose destiny
shall be fulfilled today.

13:46.392 --> 13:47.758
(grunts)

13:51.496 --> 13:53.831
Neat trick.
No tricks, stark.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.500
I command
this weapon now.

13:56.502 --> 13:58.903
And in doing so,
will fulfill my promise

13:58.905 --> 14:02.406
To the world,
to rule with
an iron hand.

14:02.408 --> 14:05.610
You want an iron hand?
I've got two.

14:05.612 --> 14:06.811
(groans)

14:09.681 --> 14:13.317
You cannot possibly
fathom my capacity
to rule.

14:13.652 --> 14:15.286
From this day forward,

14:15.288 --> 14:17.521
There will only
be one true...

14:18.023 --> 14:19.757
Yikes.

14:21.526 --> 14:23.027
(roars)

14:31.270 --> 14:32.737
Iron man:
Only one way out.

14:32.739 --> 14:35.673
Re-route power
for an electroshock
exo-charge.

14:35.675 --> 14:36.974
(roars)

14:37.609 --> 14:38.776
(grunts)

14:41.046 --> 14:42.580
(yells)

14:46.918 --> 14:49.654
(cat screeches)
iron man:
This is humiliating.

14:50.489 --> 14:51.756
(roars)

14:55.527 --> 14:57.928
It's just you and I.

15:03.702 --> 15:04.835
(serpent growling)

15:15.647 --> 15:17.682
(yells)
(glass shattering)

15:20.786 --> 15:22.553
Consume me
and spare earth.

15:22.555 --> 15:24.455
(roars)

15:29.561 --> 15:33.831
I enter valhalla proudly.

15:47.746 --> 15:49.647
Thor:
How dare you interfere?

15:49.649 --> 15:51.449
The legend
must be fulfilled.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.417
It's the only way
to save this planet.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.786
Sorry, thor,
I don't believe
anyone's destiny

15:55.788 --> 15:57.621
Is automatically
chosen for them.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.557
Besides, these
age-old legends

15:59.559 --> 16:01.692
Never mentioned
the avengers, did they?

16:02.427 --> 16:05.863
No.
Then get ready
to write a new one.

16:09.368 --> 16:10.835
(weapons firing)

16:19.411 --> 16:22.613
Listen, you and the serpent
going another 10 rounds
isn't gonna help anyone.

16:23.048 --> 16:24.815
We just need
to get it out of here.

16:25.150 --> 16:28.419
What do you say?
I will do whatever it takes.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.487
(roaring)

16:31.857 --> 16:33.724
Cap:  <i>Iron man,</i>
<i>are you reading me?</i>

16:33.726 --> 16:35.459
Yeah, cap,
where are you?

16:35.461 --> 16:37.027
We're at what's left
of the embassy.

16:37.029 --> 16:39.463
Doom's back,
and you won't believe
what we're seeing.

16:49.408 --> 16:52.610
This is the new
world order, monster!

16:54.613 --> 16:56.046
(roars)

16:58.517 --> 17:00.651
Get him off of there,
whatever it takes.

17:00.653 --> 17:03.454
After what
he did to me,
it'll be my pleasure.

17:08.460 --> 17:11.462
Your interference
is most unwelcome.

17:11.630 --> 17:12.829
Watch it!
Whoa!

17:19.003 --> 17:20.503
Thor: This is madness.

17:20.506 --> 17:24.642
How did ulik get here?
Same as you, I'm assuming?

17:24.644 --> 17:27.811
Not at all.
Trolls possess knowledge
of hidden rifts

17:27.814 --> 17:30.181
That connect earth
and the asgardian underworld.

17:30.183 --> 17:33.651
Then the first thing
we have to do
is find the rift.

17:33.653 --> 17:36.554
I've still got ulik's
weird energy signal on file.

17:36.556 --> 17:39.123
Now, discounting him
and the weapon,

17:39.125 --> 17:41.926
Let's see if we can find it
anywhere else.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.694
(computer beeps)

17:44.029 --> 17:45.196
And there it is!

17:45.198 --> 17:46.564
I think.

17:49.468 --> 17:50.935
That's the spot
right there.

17:50.937 --> 17:54.171
It's like a pinhole
in the fabric
of space-time.

17:54.173 --> 17:57.741
It needs
a bigger jolt of power
to blow it wide open.

17:57.743 --> 17:59.109
Any ideas?

17:59.111 --> 18:00.811
Aye. Only one.

18:03.915 --> 18:05.649
(thunder rumbles)

18:07.085 --> 18:08.552
(yells)

18:11.723 --> 18:12.857
Thor: There it is.

18:12.859 --> 18:15.159
Ulik's passage back
to the underworld.

18:15.161 --> 18:16.727
Then let's make
good use of it.

18:17.095 --> 18:21.532
Dr. Doom:
Serpent, you shall become
a servant of doom.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.634
Now and forever!

18:25.670 --> 18:27.938
Think this
just got serious.

18:27.940 --> 18:30.708
Iron man, the situation
has reached a crisis point.

18:30.710 --> 18:33.210
<i>What's your status?</i>
<i>Iron man:</i>
<i>Just hang tight.</i>

18:33.545 --> 18:35.513
You hit him high,
I'll hit him low.

18:35.515 --> 18:38.215
Indeed.
We must drive it
to the portal.

18:38.750 --> 18:39.984
(yells)

18:49.628 --> 18:51.295
Doom, this is insane.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.196
Even for you.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.865
Let history
be my judge.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.000
(grunts)

18:58.937 --> 19:00.671
(hawkeye screams)

19:00.673 --> 19:02.172
(roaring)

19:04.210 --> 19:08.012
Wherever you're
wanting it to go,
it's not going.

19:08.014 --> 19:10.214
Iron man: It's no use.
We need more power.

19:12.017 --> 19:14.151
Falcon:
<i>Heads up, guys.</i>
<i>Incoming.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:16.587
Falcon?
Please tell me you...
<i>I found him.</i>

19:16.589 --> 19:19.056
And he's coming your way...
(grunting)

19:19.058 --> 19:21.225
Now!
Ready for round two.

19:22.861 --> 19:24.895
(impact echoing)

19:26.197 --> 19:27.765
(serpent roaring)

19:35.140 --> 19:36.674
Pour it on.

19:36.676 --> 19:39.276
Doom! You need
to get clear, now.

19:39.278 --> 19:42.613
Dr. Doom:
Never! It is my destiny!

19:48.153 --> 19:49.853
(yells)

19:51.056 --> 19:52.323
(growls)

19:56.695 --> 19:58.329
(roars)

19:59.164 --> 20:00.297
Dr. Doom: No.

20:00.299 --> 20:02.099
No!

20:03.234 --> 20:04.368
(thor yells)

20:13.311 --> 20:14.678
(thor grunts)

20:16.314 --> 20:17.815
It worked.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.216
We've done
the impossible.

20:19.218 --> 20:21.352
The serpent's threat
has ended.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.787
Hey, it's all
in a day's work.

20:24.889 --> 20:26.256
Cap: What about doom?

20:26.258 --> 20:27.858
I imagine he'll
have his hands full

20:27.860 --> 20:29.827
In the asgardian
underworld.

20:30.161 --> 20:31.829
(laughing) indeed.

20:32.330 --> 20:35.032
The serpent will be
the least of his problems.

20:35.333 --> 20:38.068
Well, it couldn't
have happened
to a nicer dictator.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.137
(sirens wail)

20:41.740 --> 20:42.906
Hawkeye: Yikes.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.342
Somebody had better
call damage control.

20:45.344 --> 20:48.045
I mean, unless you
wanna clean this up.

20:48.047 --> 20:49.346
Whoa!
Can I use your face
as a shovel?

20:50.249 --> 20:55.052
I think I'm getting
the hang of this whole
"saving the world" thing.

20:55.054 --> 20:56.720
Iron man:
That's what it's all about.

20:57.088 --> 21:00.090
You're not just
a house guest
at avengers tower.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.959
Speaking of which...

21:08.800 --> 21:10.267
What?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.002
Ulik: This cannot be.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.704
Surprised, ulik?

21:13.706 --> 21:15.839
I heard the roar
of the serpent.

21:15.841 --> 21:18.008
I felt the earth tremble.

21:18.010 --> 21:20.911
If he is gone, then you
should have perished.

21:20.913 --> 21:23.080
How is this possible?

21:23.082 --> 21:25.115
I decided my own fate.

21:25.117 --> 21:28.318
And odin will decide yours
in asgard.

21:28.320 --> 21:30.054
Iron man: Yeah.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.789
And don't forget
to tell dear old dad

21:31.791 --> 21:34.024
That when it comes to
an avenger's destiny,

21:34.026 --> 21:36.160
No one decides it for us.

21:36.162 --> 21:37.461
Indeed.
