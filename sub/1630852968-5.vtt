smuggled over the border

43:28.173 --> 43:29.705
To be strikebreakers.

43:29.841 --> 43:34.343
(tense dramatic music)

43:34.412 --> 43:35.612
In effect,

43:35.747 --> 43:37.847
This expansion will make us
both an international railway,

43:37.849 --> 43:39.849
And a shipping conglomerate.

43:39.984 --> 43:42.785
<i> With st. Kitt's being of</i>
<i> particular interest to us,</i>

43:42.854 --> 43:45.921
Given its deep ports and its
proximity to the panama canal.

43:45.991 --> 43:47.356
This is impressive.

43:48.660 --> 43:50.293
<i> But how do you plan</i>
<i> to manage the budget</i>

43:50.428 --> 43:52.595
That would accompany
this kind of expansion?

43:52.664 --> 43:54.464
Foreign labour,
of course.

43:55.667 --> 43:56.599
Apologies for
keeping you waiting,

43:56.734 --> 43:57.600
Prime minister,

43:57.735 --> 43:59.502
I had a few pressing
matters on my desk.

43:59.571 --> 44:00.870
As I understand it,

44:00.872 --> 44:03.406
<i> The labour strike chatter</i>
<i> grows louder by the day.</i>

44:03.408 --> 44:04.940
Well, I've never let
unions get the best of me

44:05.010 --> 44:06.476
And I won't start now.

44:07.679 --> 44:09.479
I've already made the
necessary arrangements.

44:12.350 --> 44:13.816
(loud chattering)

44:13.852 --> 44:15.151
Moschel:
<i> Settle down!</i>

44:16.021 --> 44:17.320
<i> Settle down!</i>

44:18.023 --> 44:19.421
I said settle down!

44:20.558 --> 44:22.425
The strike has been called!

44:22.427 --> 44:23.425
Steel workers,

44:23.461 --> 44:24.560
Longshoremen,

44:24.562 --> 44:25.628
<i> Cops, firemen.</i>

44:25.763 --> 44:27.563
All unions are
set to walk out.

44:27.565 --> 44:30.166
And what if we don't
have jobs to walk back to

44:30.235 --> 44:31.234
When it's over?

44:31.236 --> 44:32.969
(crowd affirmations)

44:33.104 --> 44:34.804
Can you feed your
family tommy?

44:34.939 --> 44:36.338
<i> Can you pay your mortgage?</i>

44:36.408 --> 44:39.575
If we don't stand together,
we all fall apart.

44:39.577 --> 44:42.912
(crowd chatters in agreement)

44:43.047 --> 44:44.113
I'll be back in a minute.

44:44.248 --> 44:45.114
Where are you going?

44:45.249 --> 44:46.181
Moschel:
<i> Just eat your fucking cookie!</i>

44:46.217 --> 44:48.184
(crowd protests angrily)

44:48.186 --> 44:49.285
Tommy:
<i> You see?</i>

44:49.287 --> 44:51.053
<i> This is exactly what</i>
<i> I'm talking about!</i>

44:51.122 --> 44:53.055
(crowd protests angrily)

45:01.633 --> 45:03.332
(door opens)

45:03.401 --> 45:04.767
Mr. Moschel.

45:05.536 --> 45:07.403
I thought I made it clear,

45:07.472 --> 45:09.806
You need to handle
things in ottawa first.

45:09.941 --> 45:11.240
<i> If my boys get wind I'm</i>
<i> even talking to you-</i>

45:11.276 --> 45:12.809
Well, what if they got wind

45:12.944 --> 45:15.912
Of a train car full of
strikebreakers from the states?

45:15.914 --> 45:17.180
Impossible.

45:17.315 --> 45:20.082
I wrote a letter to the
minister of immigration,

45:20.085 --> 45:21.818
He assured me that the
border measures in place

45:21.953 --> 45:23.953
Would keep
foreign labour out.

45:23.955 --> 45:26.421
Well what if I heard it
from a man who escaped?

45:26.458 --> 45:31.794
(solemn dramatic music)

45:31.830 --> 45:37.299
<i> ♪ oh my soul</i>

45:52.317 --> 45:53.249
I got a business
to take care of-

45:53.318 --> 45:54.317
Hey, just wait for it.

45:54.452 --> 45:55.784
Wait for what?

45:56.320 --> 45:57.719
Wait for it.

45:59.991 --> 46:00.990
(loud fireworks bang)

46:00.992 --> 46:02.491
What the hell was?

46:06.197 --> 46:07.930
