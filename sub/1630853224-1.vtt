spring chicken, darling.

06:00.161 --> 06:01.358

06:01.393 --> 06:03.998
- For someone with
such a long journey,

06:04.033 --> 06:07.133
I hate to have to
tell you this, but,

06:09.709 --> 06:12.677

08:01.348 --> 08:04.283

with their family.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.791
- You know, you are not
gonna get much of me at home

08:06.826 --> 08:09.992
'cause my life in LA is
so much more interesting.

08:10.027 --> 08:12.357

- Well--
- Do you wanna be remembered

08:19.905 --> 08:21.674

08:21.709 --> 08:23.005

08:24.877 --> 08:27.141
I'm gonna email you
the details, good luck.

08:52.432 --> 08:55.433
- I'm just gonna
scout it out first.

08:57.470 --> 08:58.370
Here we go.

09:29.106 --> 09:30.204

09:42.053 --> 09:42.887
Can you stop filming?

09:42.922 --> 09:43.789
I'm not ready yet.

09:43.824 --> 09:45.120
- It's not how it works, Kay.

09:45.155 --> 09:46.726
- 10 Long
years, baby girl.

09:46.761 --> 09:47.925
- Or five.

09:47.960 --> 09:49.894
- You should've won
that damn contest.

09:49.929 --> 09:52.699
I gave those bloggers
a piece of my mind.

09:52.734 --> 09:53.931
- What bloggers?

09:53.966 --> 09:55.394
- And you would be?
- This is Colin.

09:55.429 --> 09:57.363
He's just gonna be doing
some filming a little bit.

09:57.398 --> 09:59.266
So let's just stay
out of his way.

09:59.301 --> 10:00.971
- Wait, is this "After The Cut"?

10:01.006 --> 10:02.236
- No.
- Yup.

10:02.271 --> 10:03.633
- How do
you know about it?

10:03.668 --> 10:06.075
- That Marissa called,
you should have told me.

10:06.110 --> 10:08.077

10:08.112 --> 10:10.475
so.

right next to mine.

10:23.864 --> 10:24.830
We'll share a wall.

10:24.865 --> 10:27.932
- Alrighty, I am

10:27.967 --> 10:30.165
'cause we're gonna have
a big couple of weeks.

10:30.200 --> 10:30.968
- A month.

10:33.665 --> 10:36.941

13:13.000 --> 13:16.397
like Americans love to
watch people eat, right?

13:16.432 --> 13:20.170
So we follow me around eating
different pieces of food

in different spots.

and then I'll warm
up like a part

that like really shows off
my range and I'll be like,

13:29.346 --> 13:30.675
oh my God, Colin, don't--

13:30.710 --> 13:33.513
- So I'm gonna
let you rest today

13:33.548 --> 13:35.614
and we'll pick this
back up tomorrow.

what are your ideas?

13:37.090 --> 13:38.452
'Cause this is like,--

13:38.487 --> 13:42.060
- Probably get better footage
once you've had a day off.

13:42.095 --> 13:43.094
- OKay.

13:46.528 --> 13:48.099
Good idea.
- Cool.

14:51.791 --> 14:52.592
Oopsies.

15:06.608 --> 15:07.805

15:24.593 --> 15:26.560
I can't believe
you're actually here.

15:26.595 --> 15:28.925
I voted for you so many times.

15:28.960 --> 15:30.927
She's here, she's here.

15:32.238 --> 15:34.403
Oh my gosh, I'm sorry, I'm
sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:34.438 --> 15:35.635

15:44.778 --> 15:45.744
huh, huh?

15:45.779 --> 15:47.317
Hi, Miss Bonnie.

15:47.352 --> 15:49.187
- Kay, this is Anna,

15:49.222 --> 15:50.551
the little songbird
I've been coaching

15:50.586 --> 15:52.223
for Spring Spectacular.

15:52.258 --> 15:53.290
- Still doing that, huh?

15:53.325 --> 15:54.819
- No, retired.

15:54.854 --> 15:58.757
Now I just help those who wanna
take it to the next level.

15:58.792 --> 16:02.299
- Oh my God Kay, you should
do the Spring Spectacular.

16:02.334 --> 16:05.302
- Oh Kay is very familiar
with the Spring Spectacular.

16:05.337 --> 16:07.271
She got her first period

16:07.306 --> 16:09.471
- Mom.
- One fan kick and boom.

16:09.506 --> 16:12.001
- This year we're raising money
for the children's hospital.

16:12.036 --> 16:15.972
- We have kids who need a
leg here, a kidney there,

16:16.007 --> 16:17.644
and they just can't afford it.

16:17.679 --> 16:20.482
- And Kay, we are so,
so glad you're here

16:20.517 --> 16:22.847
because America is going
to see how amazing you are.

16:22.882 --> 16:24.321
- And might give
a little boot to--

16:24.356 --> 16:25.652
- Yeah mom, I got it.

16:25.687 --> 16:27.192
- So what do you
think you'll sing?

16:27.227 --> 16:29.018
- Excuse me?
- For the Spectacular.

16:29.053 --> 16:31.229
- Just keep in mind,
it's an Easter theme.

16:31.264 --> 16:33.396
So think Jesus, think apostle.

16:33.431 --> 16:35.200
- I'm thinking
"Pump Up Our Love"

16:35.235 --> 16:38.335
but I'm changing all the
lyrics that say baby to savior.

16:38.370 --> 16:41.272
- And we're working
on Anna's vibrato

16:42.605 --> 16:45.342
to give her voice a
more mature sound.

16:45.377 --> 16:47.575
♪ Like Liza ♪

16:48.380 --> 16:49.676
- Uh-oh.

16:49.711 --> 16:50.842
- Let's get
to it girlfriend.

16:50.877 --> 16:52.514
- OKay well just an FYI

16:52.549 --> 16:54.615
so everyone here is
on the same page,

16:54.650 --> 16:57.486
I am going to need to check
in with "Pop Star Now!" first

16:57.521 --> 16:59.455
to see if I'm even available

16:59.490 --> 17:01.391
because I'm like
on call with them.

17:01.426 --> 17:04.724
So whatever they need, I just
like have to race outta here--

17:04.759 --> 17:06.363
- We'll have they called?

17:06.398 --> 17:07.991
- No, but something
might come up.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.334
- It won't.
- OKay, I'm just saying

17:10.369 --> 17:13.029
that I'm gonna need to
check in with them first

17:13.064 --> 17:15.174
and then I will let you know.

17:22.183 --> 17:23.578
So the mall gets really
packed on a Saturday.

17:23.613 --> 17:27.252
So there are gonna be a lot of
people who recognize me here.

17:27.287 --> 17:29.584
So should I act natural

17:29.619 --> 17:33.049
or should I actually
refer to the camera

17:34.261 --> 17:36.921
or you know, should
tell a couple jokes

17:36.956 --> 17:39.231
and really show
off my personality?

17:39.266 --> 17:40.133
- Whatever.

17:41.796 --> 17:45.105
- OKay, it's not
really an answer, but.

17:46.570 --> 17:47.470
Here we go.

18:15.126 --> 18:15.927
Hi girl.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.519
All right, where to next?

18:38.754 --> 18:40.820
- Oh my word, little Kay.

18:43.825 --> 18:44.956
- Hi, Miriam.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.663
- All covered up?

18:49.501 --> 18:52.161
I'm just teasing, whoa.

18:52.196 --> 18:54.064
I'm just kidding you.

18:54.099 --> 18:57.342
We have been praying and praying
that you'd win that show,

18:57.377 --> 19:00.510
but clearly God did
not want that from you.

19:00.545 --> 19:01.907
And you know what?

19:01.942 --> 19:03.315
If I'm being honest,

19:03.350 --> 19:05.350
I just, I think they did
you a real disservice

19:05.385 --> 19:06.978
dressing you in mustard.

19:07.013 --> 19:08.386
- OKay.
- You were just like

19:08.421 --> 19:11.114
walking gray poop home.

19:11.149 --> 19:14.491
I mean, it just washed out
your gorgeous skin tone

19:14.526 --> 19:18.792
and made you look 10 years
older than you actually are

19:18.827 --> 19:19.925
and heavier too.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.432
- OKay.
- So much bigger.

19:21.467 --> 19:24.534
I said Thursday, she's just
a little slip of a thing.

19:24.569 --> 19:27.196
You know, how'd she get
to be like a size 10?

19:27.231 --> 19:29.341
- That much, huh?
- How'd they do that?

19:29.376 --> 19:30.540
But you still look so beautiful.

19:30.575 --> 19:33.070
- OKay.
- Shut the front door.

19:36.350 --> 19:37.173
- Nano.

19:38.242 --> 19:39.076
Hey.

19:41.520 --> 19:44.015
- How long have
you been in town?

19:44.050 --> 19:45.181
- Just a day.

19:45.216 --> 19:46.985
- A week.
- A week

19:47.020 --> 19:49.592
and you haven't called me yet?

19:51.530 --> 19:53.332
You oKay, buddy?

19:53.367 --> 19:56.027
- Oh yeah, yeah,
never been better.

19:56.062 --> 19:58.194
- Wow, maybe that's why
you haven't called me yet.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.162
Who's this?

19:59.197 --> 20:00.471
- Oh, I'm sorry, this is Colin.

20:00.506 --> 20:02.132
He's like a second skin.

20:02.167 --> 20:04.409
He's my DP for the
next couple of weeks.

20:04.444 --> 20:06.070
- DP?

20:06.105 --> 20:07.907
- Director of photography.

20:07.942 --> 20:10.514
It's like a showbiz term.

20:10.549 --> 20:13.550
- Must be why I
didn't recognize it.

20:17.622 --> 20:19.424
- Yeah, they've added
this "After The Cut"

20:19.459 --> 20:21.525
part of the show I was on.

20:21.560 --> 20:22.757
- Oh yeah, I read about that,

20:22.792 --> 20:25.056
where they follow
around the losers.

20:25.091 --> 20:26.596
- Oh well, kinda.

20:27.896 --> 20:29.258
I mean, I guess there
was like this fan outrage

20:29.293 --> 20:30.567
and they were like Kay, Kay,

20:30.602 --> 20:31.898
put Kay back on the show.

20:31.933 --> 20:36.342
And so I'm one of the
stars of the show now.

20:36.377 --> 20:37.739
- Congrats dude.

20:37.774 --> 20:39.576
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

20:43.307 --> 20:45.351
Well I have a kid now.

20:45.386 --> 20:46.176
- I see.

20:48.752 --> 20:49.553
Wow.

20:51.018 --> 20:54.085
- Well you did it, good for you.

20:54.120 --> 20:55.185
- Thanks Nan.

20:56.760 --> 20:58.529
- Too bad you've turned
into shitty a friend.

20:58.564 --> 21:01.224
Did you get any of my messages?

21:03.404 --> 21:05.503
- I'm sorry, what, when?

21:05.538 --> 21:08.132
- Like over the last five years.

21:13.645 --> 21:16.514
'Cause I'm curious why you
wouldn't call me just once

21:16.549 --> 21:18.945
maybe when I got pregnant
or maybe when John left me

21:18.980 --> 21:20.452
six months after
getting me pregnant

21:20.487 --> 21:22.619
or maybe when I actually
pushed the baby out.

21:22.654 --> 21:24.489
But hey, I hope it was worth it

21:24.524 --> 21:25.754
'cause you've changed,

21:25.789 --> 21:28.625
you suck, but welcome back.

21:28.660 --> 21:29.527
Come on, bud.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.833
- How you feeling
right now, Kay?

21:42.333 --> 21:45.840
- Awesome, wonderful
feedback from my fans.

22:01.792 --> 22:03.462
- It's on.

22:05.356 --> 22:08.159
- This is
"Pop Star Now!".

22:10.999 --> 22:12.471
- This is it.

22:12.506 --> 22:14.803
- Which one of our
singers will be joining Ty

22:14.838 --> 22:18.037
in the "Pop Star
Now!" season finale?

22:18.072 --> 22:21.304
Will it be Jack or
will it be Bethany?

22:22.483 --> 22:25.484
Bethany, please take
one step forward.

22:30.249 --> 22:33.426
Tonight you will be
the one going home

22:35.760 --> 22:36.858
to the mansion!

22:37.729 --> 22:39.729
- Oh my God, oh my God.

22:42.701 --> 22:44.360
- Which
sadly means Jack,

22:44.395 --> 22:46.967
this is the end of your
journey here on our show.

22:47.002 --> 22:49.002
- Oh Buddy, you bad boy.

22:51.402 --> 22:52.610
Hey Col, you made it.

22:52.645 --> 22:53.743
- I'm heading out.

22:53.778 --> 22:55.140
- Speaking of losers,

excited me a lot,

23:13.424 --> 23:16.392
probably more than
it legally should.

23:16.427 --> 23:18.031
- I will prove it
to you, America,

23:18.066 --> 23:20.638
that I can be your
"Pop Star Now!".

23:20.673 --> 23:24.235

- Bethany's oKay, I don't get
what all they hype is about

23:48.833 --> 23:51.196
- After months with
her fellow contestants,

23:51.231 --> 23:56.201
it's not easy adjusting to
life outside of the mansion.

23:56.742 --> 23:57.103
- Oh God.

24:01.780 --> 24:03.373
Shit!

24:03.408 --> 24:05.650
- But in a few days
she was back on her feet,

24:05.685 --> 24:08.015
reconnecting with
her humble community.

24:08.050 --> 24:10.347
- I hope it was worth it
'cause you've changed,

24:10.382 --> 24:12.151
you suck, welcome back.

24:12.186 --> 24:14.857
- I mean it washed
out your skin tone

24:14.892 --> 24:17.959
and it just made you
look 10 years older

24:17.994 --> 24:19.994
than you actually are.

24:20.029 --> 24:22.832
- But nothing
cures the elimination blues

24:22.867 --> 24:25.131
like the comfort of your family.

24:25.166 --> 24:26.099
- When did this happen?

24:26.134 --> 24:27.672
What happened?

24:27.707 --> 24:29.102
- Well she started wearing
a bra at nine years old

24:29.137 --> 24:30.708
and she got her first pube 10.

24:30.743 --> 24:33.106
So no, it's not hard to believe

24:33.141 --> 24:35.680
she let her boot pop
out my by accident.

24:35.715 --> 24:37.374
- Oh my God.

24:37.409 --> 24:38.309
- Wow, Kay,

24:39.851 --> 24:42.346
we hope you're doing oKay.

24:42.381 --> 24:45.085
Hopefully Janelle
had a better week.

24:45.120 --> 24:47.989
We'll soon find out, stay tuned.

25:12.015 --> 25:14.048
- Hello?
- Hi, this is Kay

25:14.083 --> 25:16.721
Montgomery from "Pop Star Now!".

25:16.756 --> 25:18.349
- What?

25:18.384 --> 25:20.450
- "Pop Star Now!".

25:20.485 --> 25:21.352
- You say Kay?

25:21.387 --> 25:22.859
- Yeah with a K.

25:22.894 --> 25:25.829
I'm actually just calling
to see is Anna's in.

25:25.864 --> 25:26.764
OKay, thanks.

25:30.528 --> 25:32.605
- Oh my God,
is it really you, Kay?

25:32.640 --> 25:33.496
- Hi Anna.

25:34.367 --> 25:35.740
Yeah.
- Did you watch

25:35.775 --> 25:36.840
"After The Cut"?
- Yeah I watched.

25:36.875 --> 25:39.645
Listen, you know it
seems that the network

25:39.680 --> 25:41.339
is not gonna have a
problem with me at all

25:41.374 --> 25:42.912
joining this Spring Spectacular.

25:42.947 --> 25:44.342
- Seriously?
- And you know,

25:44.377 --> 25:45.849
I actually think it's going
to be a great opportunity

25:45.884 --> 25:48.544
for me to help the children.

25:48.579 --> 25:50.282
- We have our first
rehearsal tomorrow at seven.

25:50.317 --> 25:51.382
- Yeah, oKay, great.

25:52.550 --> 25:53.483
See you then.
- This is gonna be

25:53.518 --> 25:54.286
so great.

26:39.135 --> 26:40.805
- Nice job on the show.

26:40.840 --> 26:43.566
I absolutely loathe
reality television,

26:43.601 --> 26:45.502
but you have an oKay voice.

26:45.537 --> 26:47.944
- Welcome Kay.
- Oh hi, Miriam.

26:49.277 --> 26:50.881
- Now this is Clive.

26:50.916 --> 26:54.577
He's our pianist and also
bit of a local celebrity.

26:54.612 --> 26:56.887
He's just off his tour
de force performance

26:56.922 --> 27:00.088
in his man show
version of "Cats",

27:00.123 --> 27:01.287
which is called Cat.

27:01.322 --> 27:04.059
- Riveting performance
the other night.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.264
- Gentle.
- I'm so excited to meet you.

27:11.299 --> 27:12.628
I'm Michael Bronson Junior,

27:12.663 --> 27:14.432
but everybody calls me Mick.

27:14.467 --> 27:16.104
I'm so excited to meet you.

27:16.139 --> 27:17.336
- Yeah--
- I'm gonna do

27:17.371 --> 27:18.436
the best job for you,
I promise I will.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.943
- Yeah Mick, it's me, Kay.

27:19.978 --> 27:23.782
- Mick, they just
called you over there.

27:23.817 --> 27:24.783
- I gotta go 'cause I'm playing

27:24.818 --> 27:25.916
the bongos.
- Go, go,

27:25.951 --> 27:27.346
run like the wind.

27:28.217 --> 27:29.447
There was an accident.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.988
We just don't mention it.

27:32.023 --> 27:35.651
I'm so thrilled you're
joining the Spectacular.

27:35.686 --> 27:36.927
It's just wonderful

27:36.962 --> 27:39.358
and we're just gonna
be like old times.

27:39.393 --> 27:43.362
Anyhow, now that you've
met Mick and Clive,

27:43.397 --> 27:44.935
over there that's Holly.

27:44.970 --> 27:46.398
- Oh Holly.

27:46.433 --> 27:47.806
- Oh, oh, oKay, she's busy,

27:47.841 --> 27:49.808
and you know Anna.

27:50.734 --> 27:52.305
Oh, they come and go so quickly.

27:52.340 --> 27:53.911
Now before we go
into the details,

27:53.946 --> 27:57.475
I was wondering if I
could ask you to share

27:57.510 --> 27:59.213
a few pointers with the gang.

27:59.248 --> 28:00.148
- Oh, yeah.

28:01.283 --> 28:02.546
- I think it would
be really good

28:02.581 --> 28:03.987
for that program
that you're doing.

28:04.022 --> 28:06.682
- Yes, good idea, Colin?

28:06.717 --> 28:08.959
- Chop chop, Colin.

28:08.994 --> 28:10.389
Just teasing you.

28:13.295 --> 28:17.099
OKay everybody gather
around, attention, everyone.

28:17.134 --> 28:20.069
That's right, just
keep gathering.

28:20.104 --> 28:22.940
There you go, all right, gather.

28:22.975 --> 28:25.701
Keep gathering, all right.

28:25.736 --> 28:29.815
Great, now I just wanna thank
each and every one of you

28:29.850 --> 28:33.951
for giving your time, your
talents and your trust

28:35.119 --> 28:38.582
to yet another Spectacular
this year, yes.

28:38.617 --> 28:42.718
And we have a very heavy
weight on our backs this year.

28:42.753 --> 28:44.060
As you know, we're raising money

28:44.095 --> 28:45.930
for the children's hospital

28:45.965 --> 28:49.758
and what we're hoping is we'll
raise enough money to buy,

28:49.793 --> 28:50.726
what have we here?

28:50.761 --> 28:53.036
Yeah, for three prosthetics

28:53.071 --> 28:55.269
and two liver transplants.

28:56.140 --> 28:57.942
How 'bout that?

28:57.977 --> 29:00.736
Unbelievable, doing Lord's work

29:00.771 --> 29:04.542
and I'm also very excited
for this year's theme.

29:04.577 --> 29:08.513
Just busted about it,
it's Easter Extravaganza.

29:08.548 --> 29:10.746
- Yes, yes!

29:10.781 --> 29:12.286
- Isn't that fantastic?

29:12.321 --> 29:16.323
And I'd like to first
announce that the lead role

29:18.129 --> 29:21.064
in this production
will be played by

29:21.099 --> 29:24.166
Clive, he'll be
playing Jesus Christ.

29:25.532 --> 29:27.301
Don't let it get to your head.

29:27.336 --> 29:31.206
But we also have a very
special guest joining us

29:31.241 --> 29:34.176
and that's our very
own little Kay,

29:34.211 --> 29:37.916
but you may know her from
her program, "Pop Star Now!".

29:37.951 --> 29:39.951
- Whoo, I love you, Kay.

29:41.284 --> 29:44.857
- All right, now before we
pass out the song order,

29:44.892 --> 29:47.585
I've asked Kay to
just help us out

29:47.620 --> 29:50.225
by starting us off
with a few pointers,

29:50.260 --> 29:52.931
some professional pointers.

29:52.966 --> 29:54.757
So if you would.

29:54.792 --> 29:56.594
- Well hi, everybody.

29:58.169 --> 30:00.829
Well does anyone have
any questions to start?

30:00.864 --> 30:02.974
- Did you pull your
boob out on purpose?

30:03.009 --> 30:04.602
- Okie dokie, all
right, you know what?

30:04.637 --> 30:05.801
Let's just dive in,

30:05.836 --> 30:07.913
I think is best
with the song order.

30:07.948 --> 30:10.146
I'm gonna do that right now.

30:11.446 --> 30:13.116
I worked very carefully on,

30:13.151 --> 30:16.284
we have five numbers
total as per usual

30:17.485 --> 30:18.781
starting with the
opening number,

30:18.816 --> 30:22.026
that's the group
number, I love so much.

30:22.061 --> 30:24.127
♪ Easter has Sprung. ♪

30:24.162 --> 30:26.129
Love that song.
- Yay!

30:26.164 --> 30:28.032
- And then we're
gonna go to, well,

30:28.067 --> 30:31.101
I'm gonna come out
and welcome the crowd.

30:31.136 --> 30:32.465
It's a big crowd pleaser

30:32.500 --> 30:34.599
and then we're gonna
have Holly and Mick

30:34.634 --> 30:37.833
do their percussion
experimental duet.

30:37.868 --> 30:40.572
- Usually I sing a solo there,

30:40.607 --> 30:42.145
but I'm on vocal rest.

30:42.180 --> 30:44.642
So I'm doing a
percussion duet instead.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.677
I play nine instruments.

30:49.352 --> 30:51.022
- She does and then after that,

30:51.057 --> 30:53.849
we're gonna go to Anna's solo

30:53.884 --> 30:57.193
and then we'll move into the
last supper slash crucifixion,

30:57.228 --> 30:58.227
blah, blah, blah,

30:58.262 --> 31:00.130
and then we're
gonna end with Kay.

31:00.165 --> 31:01.395
So any questions?

31:03.201 --> 31:06.136
Terrific, let the
play practice begin.

31:09.603 --> 31:12.208
I'm so proud of all of you.

31:12.243 --> 31:13.341
Oh goodness, it was that,

31:13.376 --> 31:15.079
how was the volume
on that, Colin?

31:15.114 --> 31:16.674
- That was
good, I got you.

31:16.709 --> 31:18.181
- Now as far as distance goes,

31:18.216 --> 31:21.019
like is that, I know a lot
of times like in theater,

31:21.054 --> 31:22.713
you should be far away, right?

31:22.748 --> 31:24.451
But I think it's
more intimate right,

31:24.486 --> 31:25.914
when you're doing television.

31:25.949 --> 31:27.960
Well you probably know, Kay.
- Yeah.

31:27.995 --> 31:29.357
- Can get you like this.

31:29.392 --> 31:31.194
- OKay.
- It's not bad.

31:42.702 --> 31:45.241
- Where's my glass?

31:45.276 --> 31:47.111
- Are you gonna
be here the whole time?

31:47.146 --> 31:48.343
- Maybe.

31:51.975 --> 31:53.282
- I'm super happy
you're doing this.

31:53.317 --> 31:54.415
- Yeah, sure.

31:56.320 --> 31:57.880
- When we started
selling tickets

31:57.915 --> 31:59.387
and when we announced
that, you know,

31:59.422 --> 32:00.949
you'd be part of the show,

32:00.984 --> 32:03.127
we sold like almost
half of them already.

32:03.162 --> 32:04.161
Can you believe it?

32:04.196 --> 32:05.261
Pretty amazing.

32:08.167 --> 32:09.760
Do you know what you're singing?

32:09.795 --> 32:11.102
- Not yet.

32:11.137 --> 32:12.070
I can't really think of
any resurrection ballads

32:12.105 --> 32:14.303
off the top of my head yet, so.

32:14.338 --> 32:15.469
- Well maybe you
could write one.

32:15.504 --> 32:17.009
- Oh yeah, right.

32:20.003 --> 32:23.840
- I was wondering, do
you ever get nervous?

32:23.875 --> 32:26.348
I do, I always get nervous.

32:26.383 --> 32:29.879
Nothing like being on
TV though, am I right?

32:29.914 --> 32:31.947
- Well, I guess on,

32:31.982 --> 32:33.454
I guess when I sang on
the first live episode,

32:33.489 --> 32:37.128
I was nervous 'cause I puked,
but like nerves are funny.

32:37.163 --> 32:39.559
I mean, what's the
worst that can happen?

32:39.594 --> 32:41.660
Well, they could not like you

32:41.695 --> 32:44.531
and maybe vote you off the show.

32:44.566 --> 32:45.895
- True.

32:51.243 --> 32:53.276
When did you start singing?

32:53.311 --> 32:57.016
- I started singing
after my mum had to go.

32:58.316 --> 32:59.249
- What?

32:59.284 --> 33:00.778
- Oh, she got sick,

33:02.012 --> 33:03.319
so she had to go.

33:06.225 --> 33:09.655
I live with my dad and
my step-mom Jasmine now

33:09.690 --> 33:11.327
and she's pregnant.

33:11.362 --> 33:15.364
So, they mostly just
sit around and watch TV,

33:15.399 --> 33:16.860
stuff like that.
- Sorry.

33:16.895 --> 33:17.795
- Oh, it's oKay.

33:17.830 --> 33:19.368
Sometimes I watch with them.

33:19.403 --> 33:20.765
- No, I mean..

33:20.800 --> 33:22.173
- Oh, it's oKay.

33:24.034 --> 33:26.375
I'm super, super happier here

33:26.410 --> 33:29.411
even though I wish
you would have won.

33:33.285 --> 33:34.614
- You are just too fun,

33:34.649 --> 33:36.979
you're on the wrong
side of that camera,

33:37.014 --> 33:39.124
that's clear, that's clear.

33:39.159 --> 33:40.884
Are you in there?

33:49.895 --> 33:51.400
- You're welcome.

33:52.601 --> 33:54.238
- For what?

33:54.273 --> 33:55.998
- Introducing you to those folks

33:56.033 --> 34:00.376
so you could do your help
the less fortunate thing.

34:00.411 --> 34:01.278
- Goodnight, mom.

34:01.313 --> 34:03.643
- You know what your problem is?

34:03.678 --> 34:05.249
You want too much.

34:06.351 --> 34:07.548
You always have.

34:09.684 --> 34:13.048
They didn't want ya, you're
not the most talented,

34:13.083 --> 34:13.884
so what?

34:17.087 --> 34:18.328
- Goodnight, mom.

34:24.094 --> 34:26.171
- You'd be a lot happier.

34:47.293 --> 34:49.854
- I really can't speak to
this because I'm not her,

34:49.889 --> 34:52.395
but I just think it's really
sad when people feel like

34:52.430 --> 34:55.090
they have to do things like
this to gain attention,

34:55.125 --> 34:56.729
you know, especially women.

34:56.764 --> 34:58.500
We need to stay empowered.

34:58.535 --> 35:01.668
She has a really nice voice
and that should be enough.

35:01.703 --> 35:03.901
Nudity is not the
way to get ahead.

35:32.272 --> 35:33.095
- Hey.

35:43.283 --> 35:44.513
Getting a snack?

35:44.548 --> 35:46.416
- Pedialyte, my kid is sick.

35:46.451 --> 35:48.044
- Oh no, I'm sorry.

35:51.555 --> 35:54.391
If you're ever up
her getting a drink,

35:54.426 --> 35:57.988
I'm just here for the
next couple of weeks.

35:59.222 --> 36:01.057
- How about right now?

36:02.533 --> 36:03.598
- Yeah, sure.

36:05.503 --> 36:07.899
- No, I mean like right now.

36:09.408 --> 36:12.937
- Oh yeah, no, I don't
think I can do that.

36:12.972 --> 36:14.378
- Oh that's right, I forgot,

36:14.413 --> 36:15.511
you're a celebrity now.

36:15.546 --> 36:17.546
- No, that's not it.

36:17.581 --> 36:18.877
- Then why not?

36:21.585 --> 36:23.321
- Well I haven't stolen a beer

36:23.356 --> 36:25.488
since like the last
time we stole beer.

36:25.523 --> 36:27.358
- Well, it's not like
it's hard, he's blind.

36:27.393 --> 36:28.788
- Walt went blind?

36:34.928 --> 36:36.499
Security cameras.

36:36.534 --> 36:40.536
- Please, this place
barely has running water.

36:40.571 --> 36:44.540
Oh, that's right, I
forgot you changed.

36:44.575 --> 36:45.508
- No, I'm in.

36:51.846 --> 36:54.484
- OKay, it's the same as always,

36:54.519 --> 36:56.585
but now the beers
are at the back.

36:56.620 --> 36:57.586
- What?

36:57.621 --> 36:58.389
Crap.

36:58.424 --> 36:59.214
- Oh, it's fine.

36:59.249 --> 37:00.050
Come on, you're a pro.

37:00.085 --> 37:01.491
- OKay.

37:01.526 --> 37:03.218
- Go.

37:03.253 --> 37:04.890
- I'm going in.
- Go.

37:06.597 --> 37:08.795
- Wait, your bangles.

37:08.830 --> 37:11.259
Come on, blind people
can hear food digesting.

37:11.294 --> 37:12.931
- True.
- Oh and your shoes.

37:12.966 --> 37:15.604
Oh my God, those look like
who's looked like the shoes

37:15.639 --> 37:18.266
we found in Jessica
Bellerman's dad's closet.

37:18.301 --> 37:19.443
- How are the Bellerman's?

37:19.478 --> 37:20.411
- He goes by Judy now.

37:20.446 --> 37:22.039
- I knew it.
- I know.

37:22.074 --> 37:22.875
OKay, go.

37:24.351 --> 37:25.647
Wait, your skirt.

37:26.980 --> 37:28.243
- What about it?

37:28.278 --> 37:29.717
- It's gonna clack
every time you walk.

37:29.752 --> 37:30.652
- Well, I'm not
taking a skirt off.

37:30.687 --> 37:31.719
- You have to take it off.

37:31.754 --> 37:32.786
- No, I'm not.
- Take your skirt off.

37:32.821 --> 37:33.985
- I'm not taking the skirt off.

37:34.020 --> 37:35.217
- Take it off, take it off,
- No, no,

37:35.252 --> 37:36.559
- take it off, take it off.
- no, no no.

37:36.594 --> 37:37.593
- Is it vinyl?

37:38.761 --> 37:40.464
It's so ugly.
- OKay, going in.

37:40.499 --> 37:41.597
- Oh, it's designer.

37:41.632 --> 37:42.631
- What, why?

37:44.602 --> 37:45.601
Just go.

37:46.637 --> 37:49.297
Wait, don't get
anything too hoppy.

37:49.332 --> 37:50.342
- Oh my God.

37:51.334 --> 37:53.642
- It gives you hemorrhoids.

38:08.285 --> 38:09.086
Yeah.

38:22.365 --> 38:23.199
Down.

39:19.565 --> 39:20.355
- Wait, what?
- Thanks Walt,

39:20.390 --> 39:21.664
put it on my tab.

39:26.033 --> 39:27.703
- Are you kidding me?

39:57.636 --> 40:00.901
- I don't think anyone
will see this coming.

40:00.936 --> 40:03.431
- I don't think so either.

40:03.466 --> 40:05.576
- All right, Kay,

40:05.611 --> 40:07.237
Kay, you're up next.

40:07.272 --> 40:08.777
- Oh, she
had a big week.

40:08.812 --> 40:11.109
Didn't y'all read?

40:11.144 --> 40:12.440
- Hey Kay, you're up.

40:12.475 --> 40:13.617
- Yeah, I'm sorry.

40:13.652 --> 40:14.585
I don't have anything.

40:14.620 --> 40:15.817
- Oh, you don't?

40:17.249 --> 40:19.722
Oh, all right, oKay,
that's all right.

40:19.757 --> 40:22.956
So why don't we just
agree to nail it down?

40:22.991 --> 40:24.419
No pun intended.

40:24.454 --> 40:25.255
- That's me.

40:26.192 --> 40:27.455
- That was not intentional.

40:27.490 --> 40:29.259
All right, but in all serious,

40:29.294 --> 40:30.458
we'll nail something
down next week

40:30.493 --> 40:34.264
and Anna, sweetie,
you're gonna be next.

40:34.299 --> 40:38.103
- Wait, you can sing your
audition song from "Pop Star".

40:38.138 --> 40:40.875
You know, the famous
one that, you know,

40:40.910 --> 40:42.580
what's it called?

40:42.615 --> 40:44.109
- Forget the words?

40:45.310 --> 40:48.014
- Did you forget the words?
- No, no.

40:48.984 --> 40:51.413
- Oh good, that a girl.

40:52.251 --> 40:53.789
- Go, Kay.

40:53.824 --> 40:54.658
- Not yet.

I really need you, dad.

43:55.005 --> 43:58.875
You always told me
there'd be a place for me,

44:00.142 --> 44:02.010
that it was worth it.

44:06.115 --> 44:10.513
I mean, why couldn't they
see me the way you saw me?

44:15.025 --> 44:17.388
I just think this is who I am.

44:19.898 --> 44:21.524
I think mom's right.

44:22.659 --> 44:25.660
Just like always
gonna be second best.

44:30.700 --> 44:32.106
Like fourth best.

44:35.914 --> 44:39.245
I'm always just not
gonna be good enough.

44:49.092 --> 44:51.829
Need you to tell me what to do.

44:53.492 --> 44:55.866
How to get out of this mess.

didn't rub it in my face.

45:52.991 --> 45:54.749

else's dad died,

45:54.784 --> 45:57.356
so we had to use a
different storyline.

45:57.391 --> 45:59.292

46:11.834 --> 46:14.142

we have received a more
reaction from this contestants

47:12.367 --> 47:14.037
"After The Content" then we did

47:14.072 --> 47:17.073
when she was
actually on the show.

47:17.108 --> 47:21.176
Here's what America can
not stop talking about,

47:21.211 --> 47:22.111
take a look.

47:22.146 --> 47:23.178
- Hey Kay, we are freaking out.

47:23.213 --> 47:25.675
You are so hilarious.

47:25.710 --> 47:29.085
- Girl, you are
cracking us the heck up.

47:29.912 --> 47:32.682
- Hey Kay, is Perez Hilton.

47:32.717 --> 47:35.223
I have been watching every week

47:35.258 --> 47:39.392
and the stuff you've been
pulling is something.

47:39.427 --> 47:42.934
Very entertaining, any
press is good press.

47:42.969 --> 47:45.728
- Wow, I can't believe it.

47:45.763 --> 47:47.334
Here she is, America.

47:47.369 --> 47:50.370
Your old silly girl,
Kay Montgomery.

48:03.286 --> 48:05.319
Back in her small hometown,

48:05.354 --> 48:07.552
it didn't take long
for Kay to reunite

48:07.587 --> 48:10.324
with our local Thesbian group.

48:14.924 --> 48:16.231
- Well this year,

48:16.266 --> 48:17.364
we're raising money for
the children's hospital.

48:17.399 --> 48:21.137
- As soon as Kay hear,
she stepped right in.

48:22.305 --> 48:25.075
But Kay still makes time for fun

48:26.276 --> 48:29.211
and deep conversation
with herself.

48:31.809 --> 48:34.414
Stay tuned for Janelle's
"After The Cut"

48:34.449 --> 48:38.748

48:55.470 --> 48:56.502

I don't think I'm gonna be
able to fit inside the coffin.

50:01.470 --> 50:06.242

can fit you inside a photo.

OKay peoples, look dead.

50:35.273 --> 50:38.175
- No, no, no, you
killed them all.

50:38.210 --> 50:41.178
You're alive, you're the star.

50:41.213 --> 50:43.807

51:29.327 --> 51:31.723
My skin's allergic
to it or something.

51:31.758 --> 51:32.823
- Oh my gosh.

51:34.398 --> 51:36.266
That is like, when I was on
"Up Late Talking" last week

51:36.301 --> 51:39.401
and Bruno Mars came
out and pranked me.

51:40.833 --> 51:42.965
He wore so much cologne, I
could not stop smelling like it.

51:55.287 --> 51:57.188

51:57.223 --> 51:59.487
- Well this "After The
Cut" thing is crazy

51:59.522 --> 52:01.753
and it like never stops.

52:01.788 --> 52:04.459
- Oh yeah, your
little music troop.

52:04.494 --> 52:06.824
It must be weird going
from such a big stage to--

52:06.859 --> 52:08.155
- Well the troop has talent

52:08.190 --> 52:10.498
and I'm they're
helping sick kids.

52:10.533 --> 52:11.829
So it's like.

52:11.864 --> 52:13.435
- I am just so blessed I
haven't had to go through it.

52:13.470 --> 52:15.096
- Through being sick?

52:15.131 --> 52:16.669
- Oh no, no, losing.

52:21.742 --> 52:24.545
- I saw your interview about me.

52:27.385 --> 52:29.451
- Oh, oh, that one.

52:29.486 --> 52:31.981
Oh my gosh, that is
not how I intended

52:32.016 --> 52:33.356
for that to come out at all.

52:33.391 --> 52:34.918
You know how they take
things out of context

52:34.953 --> 52:36.458
just for a little sound bite?

52:36.493 --> 52:37.723
You're "After The Cut" episode,

52:37.758 --> 52:39.296
I'm sure all that
gross drunk talking

52:39.331 --> 52:41.056
was not how it
actually happened.

52:41.091 --> 52:43.564
- Actually, it was a lot worse.

52:45.304 --> 52:46.094
- Oh.

53:05.753 --> 53:06.554
- Thanks.

53:31.614 --> 53:32.415

53:47.091 --> 53:47.892

- Oh.

53:48.730 --> 53:50.125
Oh shit.
- Sorry.

53:56.199 --> 53:57.572
- It's a breast pump, Kay.

53:57.607 --> 54:00.575
- Yeah, that's what
I was thinking.

54:00.610 --> 54:02.137
- What do you want?

54:04.482 --> 54:06.614
- I wanna say I'm sorry

54:08.849 --> 54:11.080
for being a crappy friend.

54:12.622 --> 54:14.622
- Shitty, explosive shitty,

54:15.988 --> 54:17.988
diarrhea.
- Yeah, got it.

54:21.224 --> 54:22.597
- Where's Scorcese?

54:22.632 --> 54:23.499
- I don't know.

54:23.534 --> 54:25.666
Hand washing is beanie.

54:28.968 --> 54:30.737
I made the front page.

54:30.772 --> 54:33.168

- Wanna egg his house?

55:04.476 --> 55:05.574
Can I call you?

55:14.486 --> 55:16.387
- Hey, we have some beer

55:17.687 --> 55:19.522
that's about to go bad.

55:19.557 --> 55:21.887
You can have it if you want

55:30.326 --> 55:33.294
This one only expired yesterday.

55:40.710 --> 55:43.843
- I'm pretty
sure that one's expired.

55:43.878 --> 55:45.108
- Yeah, I heard.

55:45.143 --> 55:46.714

55:55.527 --> 55:58.055
- Mrs. Fillerman's class,
sophomore year, yeah.

55:58.090 --> 56:00.695
- Welcome home.
- Thanks.

56:00.730 --> 56:02.257
- I gotta tell you my mom,

56:02.292 --> 56:04.567
my mom watches the show.

56:04.602 --> 56:06.899
No, it's great, it's very cool.

56:06.934 --> 56:10.969
No, I'm serious, you're
doing your town proud.

56:11.004 --> 56:13.873
- So you work here too now?

56:13.908 --> 56:15.710
- Actually, I own this place.

56:15.745 --> 56:16.942
- Uh-oh.

56:20.717 --> 56:22.684
- So you got a big
night ahead or what?

56:22.719 --> 56:24.719
- Nope, just, you know.

56:24.754 --> 56:26.248
- 'Cause you got like a whole.

56:26.283 --> 56:27.755
- Oh crap, yeah.

56:29.286 --> 56:33.497
This was for this thing
I did for the show,

56:33.532 --> 56:34.861
after the first show

56:34.896 --> 56:36.159
and now I just sound
like an a-hole,

56:36.194 --> 56:38.227
so I'll leave it at that.

56:38.262 --> 56:40.537
So you've been in
Sandy this whole time?

56:40.572 --> 56:41.395
- Oh yeah.

56:43.432 --> 56:44.739
- You seem happy.

56:45.775 --> 56:46.774
- I am.

56:48.305 --> 56:49.612
Yeah I am, you?

56:55.114 --> 56:55.915
OKay.

56:57.556 --> 56:59.622
You sticking around some?

57:00.724 --> 57:02.790
- God no, no offense.

57:02.825 --> 57:04.385
- No, none taken.

57:08.160 --> 57:09.962
- So why did you stay?

57:11.295 --> 57:13.900
- I'm not really the go out

57:13.935 --> 57:18.608
and make something of
yourself kind of person.

57:18.643 --> 57:20.269
I always just assume that
I could make something

57:20.304 --> 57:22.810
out of myself wherever I was.

57:30.248 --> 57:31.819
You still writing?

57:35.484 --> 57:36.725
- What?

57:36.760 --> 57:37.957
- I remember back
in high school,

57:37.992 --> 57:40.729
you were always
jotting stuff down.

57:40.764 --> 57:45.228
- Yeah, I had a extreme
poetry journal phase.

57:45.263 --> 57:45.998
- A what?

57:48.332 --> 57:50.035
Extreme poetry.
- Yeah.

57:50.070 --> 57:50.871
- Cool.

57:52.468 --> 57:54.941
You should try some out here.

57:54.976 --> 57:57.306
- Oh, I don't
actually write songs.

57:57.341 --> 57:59.715
I just sing everyone else's.

58:00.718 --> 58:02.146
- Oh oKay, yeah.

58:03.380 --> 58:07.052
That's gotta suck to be
trapped like that, huh?

58:12.521 --> 58:15.423
- Can you please
pass the body of Christ?

58:15.458 --> 58:17.535
- Sure can, Judas?

58:20.903 --> 58:22.771
- Wonderful, wonderful.

58:24.775 --> 58:28.711
Kay, please tell me
you landed on a song.

58:28.746 --> 58:30.372
- I did.

58:30.407 --> 58:31.813

in you, hallelujah.

I was thinking more like 21.

1:00:31.968 --> 1:00:32.967
- No, 22 tops.

- So what's in
store for us this year

1:01:38.364 --> 1:01:40.529
at the Spring Spectacular?

1:01:40.564 --> 1:01:41.904
- Well, I'll tell you Diane,

1:01:41.939 --> 1:01:44.566
we have a fantastic
show this year

1:01:44.601 --> 1:01:47.239
called Easter Extravaganza.

1:01:47.274 --> 1:01:48.977
We do have a little
trick up our sleeves,

1:01:49.012 --> 1:01:51.474
our very own local
girl makes good,

1:01:51.509 --> 1:01:55.577
Kay Montgomery is gonna be
performing here live with us

1:01:55.612 --> 1:01:57.711
and she's singing
an original song

1:01:57.746 --> 1:01:59.922
that she just made up herself.

1:01:59.957 --> 1:02:01.418
- You heard it here, folks,

1:02:01.453 --> 1:02:04.553
a special guests from
TV's "Pop Star Now!".

1:02:04.588 --> 1:02:05.928
There's only a few tickets left.

1:02:05.963 --> 1:02:09.261
So you wanna come on
down and snag yours.

1:02:16.105 --> 1:02:17.269
- Hello?

1:02:17.304 --> 1:02:19.106
- Kay, Marissa, gotta
make this quick.

1:02:19.141 --> 1:02:20.701
So the producers want
you to do that song

1:02:20.736 --> 1:02:22.571
you've been writing
on the finale.

1:02:22.606 --> 1:02:23.704
- Really?
- I know,

1:02:23.739 --> 1:02:26.146
I can't believe it either.

1:02:26.181 --> 1:02:28.115
- Dang, I mean
this means so much.

1:02:28.150 --> 1:02:29.743
- Yeah, that's cute.

1:02:29.778 --> 1:02:31.888
So the band needs some extra
time to rehearse with you now.

1:02:31.923 --> 1:02:33.890
So we'll be flying
you out a day early.

1:02:33.925 --> 1:02:35.892
- Oh, oh you mean tomorrow?

1:02:35.927 --> 1:02:37.751
- Yes.

1:02:37.786 --> 1:02:39.060
- Can't they just squeeze me in

1:02:39.095 --> 1:02:40.259
after I arrive?

1:02:40.294 --> 1:02:41.865
- No.

1:02:41.900 --> 1:02:46.067
- It's just that it's
Easter Extravaganza tomorrow

1:02:46.102 --> 1:02:48.003
and I promised--
- No Kay, it's insane here.

1:02:48.038 --> 1:02:52.370
Rehearsing a day early is
the only way they can do it.

1:02:52.405 --> 1:02:54.108
You signed a contract, Kay.

1:02:54.143 --> 1:02:56.407
This is huge exposure,
they never do this.

1:02:56.442 --> 1:02:58.805
What is the holdup?

1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:00.642
- They can't make an acception?

1:03:00.677 --> 1:03:02.479
- Once again Kay,
not how it works.

1:03:02.514 --> 1:03:04.085
I'll be emailing
you flight details,

1:03:04.120 --> 1:03:05.218
I'll see you tomorrow.

1:03:08.817 --> 1:03:09.827
- Of course.

1:03:13.822 --> 1:03:16.526
- Try shifting
your weight to your right.

1:03:16.561 --> 1:03:18.099
- I think it's the rope.
- Nope.

1:03:18.134 --> 1:03:19.529
- See, there's a knot
in it right here.

1:03:19.564 --> 1:03:21.102
- Mick, my brother's
a contractor.

1:03:21.137 --> 1:03:22.466
I'll get him in here
tomorrow and he can--

1:03:22.501 --> 1:03:23.830
- Tomorrow?

1:03:23.865 --> 1:03:28.142
I'm dangling 10 feet
up in the air, people!

1:03:28.177 --> 1:03:30.276
- Miriam, Miriam, if
you have a second?

1:03:30.311 --> 1:03:31.882
- What is it doll?

1:03:33.215 --> 1:03:35.413
- I just got a call
from "Pop Star"

1:03:35.448 --> 1:03:39.813
and they want me to sing
my song in the finale.

1:03:39.848 --> 1:03:41.683
- Oh that's wonderful, Kay.

1:03:41.718 --> 1:03:42.816
Isn't that sweet?

1:03:42.851 --> 1:03:44.158
- Oh my gosh, no way.

1:03:44.193 --> 1:03:45.786
- Yeah, yeah.

1:03:45.821 --> 1:03:48.624
- And you're making me come
back a little bit earlier

1:03:48.659 --> 1:03:51.792
than planned, tomorrow actually.

1:03:51.827 --> 1:03:56.137
So I am going to have
to miss the Spectacular.

1:03:56.172 --> 1:03:57.666
- What?
- Oh shit.

1:03:57.701 --> 1:03:58.975
- Seriously?

1:03:59.010 --> 1:04:01.373
- Can't you stay for the
Spectacular and then go?

1:04:01.408 --> 1:04:02.671
- That's what you can do.

1:04:02.706 --> 1:04:04.013
What she just said,
that's what we'll do.

1:04:04.048 --> 1:04:05.212
- You can do that,
that would work.

1:04:05.247 --> 1:04:06.741
- Still up here.

1:04:06.776 --> 1:04:08.743
- What about the hospital
and all the tickets?

1:04:08.778 --> 1:04:11.845
- Anna, Anna, you
could sing my song.

1:04:11.880 --> 1:04:14.353
- Well, we'd have to
make an announcement

1:04:14.388 --> 1:04:15.959
and refund tickets.

1:04:15.994 --> 1:04:18.687
- Oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1:04:18.722 --> 1:04:20.062
I'm sure people will understand.

1:04:20.097 --> 1:04:22.229
- They will not understand.

1:04:23.760 --> 1:04:27.333
The audience was counting
on you and we added a show.

1:04:27.368 --> 1:04:28.895
- We did?

1:04:28.930 --> 1:04:31.502
- Just don't go.

1:04:31.537 --> 1:04:32.437
- What?

1:04:32.472 --> 1:04:33.405
- Don't go.

1:04:35.046 --> 1:04:36.507
- How?
- They don't own you,

1:04:36.542 --> 1:04:37.706
miss your flight,

1:04:37.741 --> 1:04:39.048
take a later one
after the Spectacular.

1:04:39.083 --> 1:04:40.214
- Yeah, yeah, you could do that.

1:04:40.249 --> 1:04:42.546
Do that.
- Still up here.

1:04:44.022 --> 1:04:44.878
- Yeah, I can't do that.

1:04:44.913 --> 1:04:45.747
- Why not?

1:04:46.948 --> 1:04:48.255
- Well I don't wanna
jeopardize anything.

1:04:48.290 --> 1:04:50.290
- Oh, so you want to go?

1:04:52.921 --> 1:04:53.931
- Well yeah.

1:04:55.132 --> 1:04:56.824
Well they're finally
taking me seriously, Nan.

1:04:56.859 --> 1:04:57.924
- They're taking you seriously?

1:04:57.959 --> 1:04:59.464
When did they start doing that?

1:04:59.499 --> 1:05:01.367
- It's just not how things work.

1:05:01.402 --> 1:05:03.369
- Right, like in the real world.

1:05:03.404 --> 1:05:06.042
- No, I'm just saying I have
to stick to my commitment.

1:05:06.077 --> 1:05:07.703
- What do you think this is?

1:05:07.738 --> 1:05:10.376
You wouldn't know the real
world if it shat on your face.

1:05:10.411 --> 1:05:12.345
- I am just really stuck here.

1:05:12.380 --> 1:05:13.643
- Tell me about it.

1:05:13.678 --> 1:05:14.908
- This is not my fault.

1:05:14.943 --> 1:05:16.811
- No, it's your choice.

1:05:28.132 --> 1:05:29.197
- I fixed it.

1:05:31.201 --> 1:05:32.860
You don't have call your
brother 'cause I fixed it.

1:05:32.895 --> 1:05:34.070
- Yes I do.

1:05:34.105 --> 1:05:36.435
I have to have him refix
what you just fixed.

1:05:36.470 --> 1:05:37.271
Come on.

1:05:40.144 --> 1:05:42.276
- Does he have
to go on one of those?

1:05:42.311 --> 1:05:44.575
Do you even have insurance?

1:05:52.288 --> 1:05:55.586
- Hey, good news
about your song.

1:05:55.621 --> 1:05:58.721
Must be good if they're
having you come back early.

1:05:58.756 --> 1:06:00.756
- If I can finish it.

1:06:00.791 --> 1:06:03.561
- I always knew
you had it in you.

1:06:06.665 --> 1:06:10.667
Too bad you have to leave
the gang high and dry.

1:06:13.738 --> 1:06:16.079
You know a lot of those
sick kids watch the show.

1:06:16.114 --> 1:06:17.344
They voted for you too.

1:06:17.379 --> 1:06:20.314
- And what is it
that I owe them, mom?

1:06:20.349 --> 1:06:21.744
- I didn't say you owed

1:06:21.779 --> 1:06:25.022
them anything--
- Well you didn't have too.

1:06:28.016 --> 1:06:30.291
- Why are you
leaving again, Kay?

1:06:30.326 --> 1:06:31.952
- Can't you just
be happy for me?

1:06:31.987 --> 1:06:33.360
- I am happy for you.

1:06:33.395 --> 1:06:34.922
- No you're not.
- Yes, I'm happy for you.

1:06:34.957 --> 1:06:35.725
- But?

1:06:38.268 --> 1:06:40.697
- Baby girl, you're not happy.

1:06:42.272 --> 1:06:44.536
- And how would you know?

1:06:44.571 --> 1:06:47.473
- OKay, I have let you play
this thing through, but you...

1:06:47.508 --> 1:06:50.377
You are like to Delisa
on "Sunset of Desire",

1:06:50.412 --> 1:06:53.182
determined to elope with Derek

1:06:53.217 --> 1:06:54.975
when she should have stayed put

1:06:55.010 --> 1:06:57.714
and she wound up destroying
the lives of the whole village.

1:06:57.749 --> 1:07:01.223
- Well did Delisa have
a mother like you?

1:07:01.258 --> 1:07:03.225
Ever since I've gotten home,

1:07:03.260 --> 1:07:05.425
all you've done is paraded
yourself around here

1:07:05.460 --> 1:07:08.461
and hijack the one
thing I've got.

1:07:08.496 --> 1:07:10.397
- I did you a favor.

1:07:10.432 --> 1:07:12.729
I gave them something
more than a drunk,

1:07:12.764 --> 1:07:14.368
sad couch performance.

1:07:14.403 --> 1:07:18.504
- So you did notice that
I was sad and drunk.

1:07:18.539 --> 1:07:20.407
- You should be glad
that I care this much.

1:07:20.442 --> 1:07:22.310
- Your care is a curse,

1:07:23.742 --> 1:07:25.445
it suffocates me.

1:07:25.480 --> 1:07:28.250
I've had to be away from
this house for five years

1:07:28.285 --> 1:07:30.186
just so I can breathe my own air

1:07:30.221 --> 1:07:31.077
and look what it's got me,

1:07:31.112 --> 1:07:32.320
I'm America's biggest joke.

1:07:32.355 --> 1:07:33.717
- That's not on me,

1:07:33.752 --> 1:07:35.389
that was your choice.

1:07:35.424 --> 1:07:37.787
And now the dress isn't right
and the camera's not right,

1:07:37.822 --> 1:07:40.053
and what, now your
mom's not right?

1:07:40.088 --> 1:07:40.922
Nah.

1:07:41.925 --> 1:07:43.760
What the heck do you want?

1:07:43.795 --> 1:07:45.366
No, what do you want?

1:07:45.401 --> 1:07:47.203
Do you want me to care, do
you not want me to care?

1:07:47.238 --> 1:07:48.369
Let me know.

1:07:48.404 --> 1:07:50.030
You want me involved,
not involved?

1:07:50.065 --> 1:07:52.340
Tell me what to do
and I will do it.

1:07:52.375 --> 1:07:54.474
- I don't want to be you.

1:07:55.939 --> 1:07:57.279
I don't wanna wear a leotard,

1:07:57.314 --> 1:07:58.874
I don't wanna have
ice in my wine,

1:07:58.909 --> 1:08:02.284
I don't want to end up with
a shack in my backyard.

1:08:02.319 --> 1:08:04.352
Quit trying to be
something you're not.

1:08:04.387 --> 1:08:06.354
You are an embarrassment, mom,

1:08:06.389 --> 1:08:09.489
and I don't wanna
be a fucking loser.

1:08:27.971 --> 1:08:30.345
- You don't wanna be a loser?

1:08:33.680 --> 1:08:37.484
Then I suggest you figure
out how you can win.

1:08:52.567 --> 1:08:56.338

moments away from crowning

1:11:55.211 --> 1:11:57.486
our "Pop Star Now!" winner.

1:11:57.521 --> 1:12:00.313
But first we have
another one of our losers

1:12:00.348 --> 1:12:02.491
with a very special performance.

1:12:02.526 --> 1:12:06.396
Here is your third runner
up, Kay Montgomery.

1:12:14.065 --> 1:12:18.199
Kay, well you have had quite
the bumpy ride here on our show

1:12:18.234 --> 1:12:21.235
and if a natural born
superstar like Bethany

1:12:21.270 --> 1:12:22.643
had not shown up,

1:12:22.678 --> 1:12:25.712
I would have sworn that you
would have had a better shot.

1:12:25.747 --> 1:12:27.516
Let's take a look.

1:12:27.551 --> 1:12:28.715
- My name
is Kay Montgomery

1:12:28.750 --> 1:12:31.652
and I've wanted to be
a singer my whole life.

1:12:31.687 --> 1:12:35.348
- I liked the song, but
I'm not sure about the vocals.

1:12:35.383 --> 1:12:36.822
- Well something
really good about it,

1:12:36.857 --> 1:12:40.727
but something that about like
fingernails on a chalk board.

1:12:40.762 --> 1:12:42.993
♪ Right before the song began ♪

1:12:43.028 --> 1:12:45.831

1:12:47.362 --> 1:12:49.164
I'm sorry, you're out.

1:12:51.773 --> 1:12:53.740
Quite the journey, Kay.

1:12:53.775 --> 1:12:56.479
And America has really
taken to that journey

1:12:56.514 --> 1:12:58.811
and the journey
after that journey.

1:12:58.846 --> 1:13:00.340
So we have asked you
here tonight to sing

1:13:00.375 --> 1:13:02.243
a very special song, haven't we?

1:13:02.278 --> 1:13:04.179
- Yes, a song I wrote myself.

1:13:04.214 --> 1:13:06.687
- So here's singing
an original song,

1:13:06.722 --> 1:13:10.086
here's our troubled girl, Kay.

1:13:21.704 --> 1:13:24.672
- But first I just
want to thank the folks

1:13:24.707 --> 1:13:28.236
at "Pop Star Now!"
for covering the costs

1:13:29.547 --> 1:13:32.779
of the Easter
Extravaganza ticket sales.

1:13:36.213 --> 1:13:38.851
And for their generous donation

1:13:38.886 --> 1:13:42.052
to the Sandy
Children's Hospital,

1:13:42.087 --> 1:13:42.987
$1 million.

1:13:43.924 --> 1:13:45.121
- What?

1:13:46.828 --> 1:13:47.662
- We need to go to commercial.

1:13:47.697 --> 1:13:49.631
- We can't.

1:13:49.666 --> 1:13:52.128
- What, did you know about this?

1:13:52.163 --> 1:13:53.635
Colin!

1:13:53.670 --> 1:13:56.671
- So thank you,
you really do care.

1:13:58.972 --> 1:14:01.170
Now I don't think it's
right to sing this one

1:14:01.205 --> 1:14:03.436
without my friends from
Sandy backing me up.

1:14:03.471 --> 1:14:04.547
What do y'all thinking?

1:14:06.441 --> 1:14:07.715
- Yeah!

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:09.585
- Well then let me
introduce the cast

1:14:23.194 --> 1:14:24.633
- Oh go, Holly.

1:14:24.668 --> 1:14:26.998
- You gotta be kidding me.

1:14:28.364 --> 1:14:29.330
- Hey look, we're on TV

1:14:29.365 --> 1:14:31.574
Hi mom and Jerry.

1:14:31.609 --> 1:14:33.268
- You sure are, buddy.

1:14:33.303 --> 1:14:35.336
- Just do it, do it, quick,

1:14:35.371 --> 1:14:38.438
we are not going commercial.

1:14:38.473 --> 1:14:39.472
We are live!

1:14:40.618 --> 1:14:42.783
- Well it seems
America wants more.

1:14:45.986 --> 1:14:47.513
- Zoom
on camera three.

1:14:47.548 --> 1:14:52.056
- America, this is why this is
the best show on television.

1:14:52.091 --> 1:14:53.893
Anything can happen.

1:14:54.863 --> 1:14:58.392

and her Easter people.
