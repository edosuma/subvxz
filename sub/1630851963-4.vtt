10:46.400 --> 10:47.880
To put himself in the spotlight.

10:47.920 --> 10:50.120
Exactly! He gets off

10:50.160 --> 10:51.760
on everyone knowing
how good he is.

10:51.800 --> 10:53.960
Better than good.
Mind-blowing.

10:54.000 --> 10:55.920
No one likes to be told
they're a shit shag.

10:55.960 --> 10:57.680
I'll take your word for it.
[Chuckles]

10:57.720 --> 10:59.240
He's gonna know
we're stitching him up.

10:59.280 --> 11:00.520
I want him making mistakes.

11:00.560 --> 11:02.200
I want him making
deranged phone calls

11:02.240 --> 11:03.400
that we can actually track.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.000
That's how we get him, Bax.

11:05.720 --> 11:06.920
He's only human.

11:09.880 --> 11:12.320
JOY: Lovely looking girl,
Carnage Bae.

11:12.360 --> 11:13.480
Love the hair.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.080
Have you felt that lump before?

11:20.520 --> 11:22.920
-You can't feel that?
-That's my skull.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.880
[Sighs] Sometimes it takes
someone else to spot them.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.840
My husband found the lump
on my breast.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.280
That wiped the smile
off his face.

11:29.320 --> 11:30.760
Oh my God, Joy...

11:30.800 --> 11:34.200
Oh no, thank God,
in my case it wasn't cancer.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.160
-It's just a fatty deposit.
-A what?

11:36.200 --> 11:39.240
Funny how they measure them
in fruit. Tumors.

11:39.280 --> 11:42.560
It's the size of a blueberry,
a grape, a satsuma, an apple.

11:42.600 --> 11:45.120
I think about that every time
I eat a grapefruit. [Chuckles]

11:45.160 --> 11:46.360
[Knock at door]

11:46.920 --> 11:48.160
We're ready now.

11:50.440 --> 11:51.800
Happiness!

11:51.840 --> 11:53.440
Sorry to rush you along,
darling.

11:53.480 --> 11:55.040
We've got an anti-vaxxer on,

11:55.080 --> 11:58.040
only his kid gave him measles.
I need to cover up the welts.

11:58.080 --> 11:59.160
Thanks, Joy.

12:06.320 --> 12:07.400
[Door closes]

12:07.440 --> 12:08.920
Can you turn off
your microphone?

12:09.760 --> 12:11.320
You'll have to unzip me.

12:15.880 --> 12:17.720
You can't blame me
for Carnage Bae.

12:17.760 --> 12:20.560
I'm a dinosaur,
until about 2017,

12:20.600 --> 12:22.200
I thought you said meme
in a French accent.

12:22.240 --> 12:23.560
Kinda like segue...

12:24.040 --> 12:25.720
"Me-may".

12:25.760 --> 12:27.960
Tomorrow morning,
Wingate's going to be shot dead
on his doorstep.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.160
We need you to report it
as fact,

12:30.200 --> 12:31.280
pin it on the killer.

12:31.320 --> 12:33.240
Carefully-planned,
ritualized kills

12:33.280 --> 12:36.240
suggests an inability
to improvise.

12:36.280 --> 12:37.880
He'll start making mistakes.

12:37.920 --> 12:39.200
Then, when we catch him,

12:39.240 --> 12:42.400
you can reveal that Wingate
is alive and well.

12:42.440 --> 12:44.320
I'm guessing you and Nathan
came up with this?

12:45.480 --> 12:46.880
So why isn't he here?

12:46.920 --> 12:48.680
Because I need to know
that you can behave yourself.

12:48.720 --> 12:50.760
We're offering you two stories
for the price of one.

12:50.800 --> 12:53.120
Assuming the killer
really does go to pieces.

12:53.160 --> 12:54.600
He's not invincible,

12:54.640 --> 12:56.040
you just made him look that way.

12:56.080 --> 12:57.680
I'm really not interested
in him.

12:57.720 --> 13:00.880
Dishonest institutions pose
a far bigger threat to people.

13:00.920 --> 13:02.680
What do you know about honesty?

13:02.720 --> 13:04.000
You sniff out cops

13:04.040 --> 13:06.440
with an axe to grind
and get them shit-faced.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.680
Or you just flat-out bribe them,
like Chambers.

13:08.720 --> 13:13.360
Right now, you're not
in a position to lecture me
on professional integrity

13:13.400 --> 13:15.160
after what you have
just asked me to do.

13:15.200 --> 13:16.880
But, I get the anger.

13:16.920 --> 13:18.760
We've made
very similar sacrifices.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.960
We have nothing in common.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.680
There are some differences.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.200
I punch up.
I'm not institutionalized.

13:25.240 --> 13:26.760
And I can be wrong.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.040
I can hold my hands up and say,
hey, I lost this round.

13:30.080 --> 13:31.440
You're allowed to lose?

13:32.680 --> 13:34.040
I can't win.

13:34.080 --> 13:35.760
And you want my help with that?

13:38.600 --> 13:39.640
Okay.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.720
Kate?

14:07.640 --> 14:09.560
Detective Sergeant Rose.

14:09.600 --> 14:10.720
Have you got a minute?

14:13.360 --> 14:15.200
D'you know Aquarium
in Shoreditch?

14:15.240 --> 14:16.760
Club with
the indoor swimming pool?

14:16.800 --> 14:18.440
Sure. They skimp
on the chlorine,

14:18.480 --> 14:20.160
but it all adds
to the Russian roulette charm
of the place.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.360
Well, my chef de partie
caught noro-virus off one
of the hot tubs.

14:22.400 --> 14:24.960
So it's not a great time
to be honest.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.040
I want to talk to you
about the murder
of Teresa Shepton.

14:38.840 --> 14:40.240
Look, what's your problem?

14:40.280 --> 14:43.160
Teresa's boyfriend, Adam Malik,
he sold you heroin.

14:43.200 --> 14:45.760
You saw Adam the night
he vanished.

14:45.800 --> 14:48.320
You saw someone else
too. Didn't you, Kate?

14:48.360 --> 14:52.520
I'm not an idiot.
I recognize you.

14:52.560 --> 14:54.280
Your name's on that list.

14:54.320 --> 14:56.640
There's only one reason you're
interested in Teresa Shepton.

14:56.680 --> 15:00.360
The guy I saw, you think
it's the Ragdoll killer?

15:00.400 --> 15:02.560
They call him the Faust.

15:02.600 --> 15:05.120
I think you're the only
person to see his face and live.

15:06.160 --> 15:07.720
Help us.

15:07.760 --> 15:11.440
I knew that man was a psycho,
I could see it in his eyes,

15:11.480 --> 15:14.400
but now I'm reading the papers
like everyone else

15:14.440 --> 15:15.800
and he's some kind of genius.

15:15.840 --> 15:17.680
-He's only human.
-That's not what it looks like.

15:17.720 --> 15:20.760
And everyone that gets within
six feet of you winds up dead.

15:20.800 --> 15:22.120
So piss off!

15:26.440 --> 15:27.800
I'm gonna leave you my card.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.120
I mean it, stay away from me.

15:36.400 --> 15:40.040
The killer used this to track
Eric Turner's prison van
yesterday.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.360
Can you tell me
where he bought it?

15:41.400 --> 15:42.920
I can run off a list
of suppliers.

15:42.960 --> 15:44.240
It's not specialist equipment.

15:44.840 --> 15:47.200
Hey, can you also...

15:47.240 --> 15:50.840
could you
trace this number for me?
That would be amazing.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.040
[Cell phone ringing]

16:05.760 --> 16:07.960
Yeah, there's a scrambler on it.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.160
It's a trick criminals use to
secure two-way comms
with a victim.

16:11.200 --> 16:13.080
What, like,
in a kidnap situation?

16:13.120 --> 16:15.920
Kidnappers, blackmailers.

16:15.960 --> 16:17.840
I explained all of this
to DS Rose.

16:17.880 --> 16:20.200
He was asking about
the same number. I told
him it's not on our system.

16:20.240 --> 16:23.720
Wait, Rose thought this number
belongs to the Ragdoll killer?

16:23.760 --> 16:26.800
It was a theory.
He did blackmail
two of his victims.

16:26.840 --> 16:28.480
You guys need to work on
your communication.

16:28.520 --> 16:30.160
It very nearly
saved my marriage.

17:21.880 --> 17:25.720
I heard the judge agreed to come
in tomorrow.
What did you tell him?

17:25.760 --> 17:27.520
Look, I need your help
on something.

17:27.560 --> 17:29.320
Yesterday, I saw
you go above and beyond--

17:29.360 --> 17:30.800
-I'm in.
-You didn't let me finish.

17:30.840 --> 17:33.240
I mean, you can keep
flattering me.

17:33.280 --> 17:36.960
I'm not flattering you.
Yesterday, you ignored
a direct order.

17:37.000 --> 17:39.160
Yeah! To protect you.

17:39.200 --> 17:40.760
I told you to stay
with Eric Turner.

17:40.800 --> 17:42.360
Wait. So, I'm responsible
for his death?

17:42.400 --> 17:43.680
No, I'm not saying that.

17:43.720 --> 17:46.120
But I need to know you can
do exactly as I say.

17:46.160 --> 17:49.560
I need you to stay in your car
tomorrow, whatever happens.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.480
You can trust me, ma'am.

17:52.360 --> 17:53.800
Meet me at Wingate's at 5 am.

17:53.840 --> 17:55.600
Well is Rose involved?

17:55.640 --> 17:58.160
I'm not questioning
your judgement at all.

17:58.200 --> 17:59.280
The less you know, the better.

17:59.320 --> 18:00.360
What if I don't accept
those terms?

18:01.960 --> 18:04.080
Rose and I both know
how good you are.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.480
Are you in?

18:09.480 --> 18:11.000
Yeah, I'm in.

18:11.040 --> 18:13.680
DC Edmunds? Someone called
Hannah delivered this for you.

18:15.120 --> 18:17.200
Thank you.

18:17.240 --> 18:20.480
I'm sorry, if you told me,
I forgot. Is Hannah your
girlfriend?

18:21.920 --> 18:25.840
Er, I don't think
I ever said. Did I?

18:25.880 --> 18:27.520
I don't know, I'm asking.

18:27.560 --> 18:30.760
Yeah. Yeah, that's her.
That's Hannah.

for counter-terror training
exercises at Hendon.

to look great.

19:50.520 --> 19:52.320
It's a peace offering, Rose.

19:52.360 --> 19:54.040
You know, crime is born
of two things,

19:54.080 --> 19:56.280
knobishness and need.

19:56.320 --> 19:57.920
I now see that
you're not a knob.

I'm not a criminal, either.

the truth of your diagnosis.

[Clears throat]

20:05.280 --> 20:07.720
You were psychotic when
you attacked Hooper.

20:07.760 --> 20:10.040
But, you broke the law before
the trial too,

20:10.080 --> 20:11.800
because you needed a conviction.

20:11.840 --> 20:15.400
Can we blame all of that
on your PTSD?

20:15.440 --> 20:18.880

How about we knock the booze
on the head?

I know I get a bit
micromanagery.

Really? You put some water
in the pan,

then you turn the pan on.
Have you cooked pasta before?

business, where you want to
spend the night.

25:10.200 --> 25:11.320
Except you.

25:16.240 --> 25:17.440
[Sighs]

25:21.720 --> 25:25.000
You never talk about
the hospital.

25:25.040 --> 25:28.040
Every time I think about it,
it's like a big hole
opens up in me.

25:29.920 --> 25:31.680
When you saw cops
outside your flat,

25:31.720 --> 25:34.480
did it make you feel like
you were back inside there?
Locked up?

25:36.600 --> 25:38.760
It reminded me
how much you care.

25:43.280 --> 25:45.040
That's what made you run away?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.520
I felt ashamed.

25:54.560 --> 25:56.800
You deserve
so much better than me.

26:17.680 --> 26:19.080
-It's the dog.
-[Exhales]

26:21.240 --> 26:23.760
Did you drink
some of that tequila?

26:23.800 --> 26:25.480
What?
That's a weird thing to say.

26:25.520 --> 26:27.760
No, I'm just asking,
I'm not judging. Was it good?

26:27.800 --> 26:29.800
I drink the same as any man
in our department.

26:29.840 --> 26:32.080
You wouldn't be up my arse
if I was any of those lot.

26:32.120 --> 26:34.040
Yeah, cause I don't give
a toss about them.

26:37.640 --> 26:39.280
[Whispers] Oh, God.

27:10.440 --> 27:12.480
-Hello?
-I'm clearing out.

27:12.520 --> 27:14.000
I'm about to get on a plane.

27:14.040 --> 27:15.720
BAXTER: Rose who is it? Rose?

27:15.760 --> 27:17.640
It's, it's okay. All good.

27:17.680 --> 27:19.520
BAXTER: Rose, I can hear you.
Who's on the phone?

27:19.560 --> 27:20.800
[Whispers] Can I call you later?

27:20.840 --> 27:22.480
No. I'm really late.

27:22.520 --> 27:23.760
Where are you headed?

27:23.800 --> 27:25.600
You think I'm gonna tell you
over the phone?

27:25.640 --> 27:28.600
The minute I get to security
that's it, I'm done.

27:28.640 --> 27:30.160
You will never
hear from me again.

27:30.200 --> 27:32.640
Okay, okay.
Give me two minutes.

27:32.680 --> 27:34.160
I need to find
somewhere quiet

27:42.400 --> 27:44.920
Rose? Where are you going?

27:44.960 --> 27:47.320
I have a lead on the killer,
a possible eyewitness.

27:47.360 --> 27:49.080
-How? Who is it?
-Stay in the car.

27:49.120 --> 27:50.680
Whatever happens,
stay in there.

27:50.720 --> 27:53.000
Wait, wait, who is the witness?

27:53.480 --> 27:54.600
Rose?

28:08.600 --> 28:10.120
[Phone vibrating]

28:10.160 --> 28:11.920
ROSE: The killer is outside
the house.

28:11.960 --> 28:13.640
What? What does he look like?

28:13.680 --> 28:15.920
Don't know.
He phoned me to brag,
he couldn't resist.

28:15.960 --> 28:18.120
I can't trace the call,
it was a blocked number.

28:18.160 --> 28:19.920
Look I am deeply sorry
about last night.

28:19.960 --> 28:21.320
The strain got to me.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.760
I think we were all
very emotional--

28:22.800 --> 28:24.880
Go back upstairs, now,
lock the door. Don't come out.

28:24.920 --> 28:26.240
Wait for Rose.

28:29.640 --> 28:31.280
What did he say?

28:31.320 --> 28:33.720
He thinks we're moving Wingate
to the safe house this morning.

28:33.760 --> 28:35.680
He doesn't know
about the squibs.

28:35.720 --> 28:38.200
I'm searching the streets
at the back of the house.

28:38.240 --> 28:39.560
You search the front.

28:39.600 --> 28:41.080
I'll tell the officers outside.

28:41.120 --> 28:43.560
Don't. He could be disguised
as one of them,

28:43.600 --> 28:46.760
or could have
blackmailed one of them.

28:46.800 --> 28:48.600
We can't trust anyone, Bax.

28:48.640 --> 28:50.160
[Sighs] Damnit.

28:58.240 --> 29:00.600
You only go inside
if you hear someone in distress.

29:00.640 --> 29:02.280
-You got that?
-Yes, ma'am.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.800
Right, I'm here now.

29:07.840 --> 29:11.160
All right, look, I don't know
if Adam killed Teresa Shepton.

29:11.200 --> 29:12.880
But no way did he do a runner.

29:12.920 --> 29:15.560
For one thing, I owed him
a grand.
That's why I went round.

29:15.600 --> 29:17.920
Only, he was a mess.

29:17.960 --> 29:19.040
What do you mean?

29:19.080 --> 29:20.640
Adam never got high.

29:20.680 --> 29:22.440
But that night,
he was out of it.

29:22.480 --> 29:24.280
Then a paramedic shows up.

29:24.320 --> 29:25.560
What, so you called
an ambulance?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.680
No. The paramedic
just appeared.

29:27.720 --> 29:29.400
He said I'd left
the door open.

29:29.440 --> 29:31.080
This paramedic,
what did he look like?

29:31.120 --> 29:34.400
Uh, he was a stocky bloke,
strong, beard.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.720
Was he white?

29:35.760 --> 29:37.160
Yes, yeah.

29:37.200 --> 29:38.360
Age, roughly?

29:38.400 --> 29:39.760
Was he over 18?

29:39.800 --> 29:44.200
Yeah, he was in his 30s.
Big blue eyes, kind of wet eyes.

29:44.240 --> 29:48.200
Boxer's nose. Calm.

29:48.240 --> 29:53.520
And we will be crossing live
to a location in central London
soon, for some expected

in the Ragdoll

it gets, I can do it.

they could stay anonymous.

my orders.

all over it.

at your place two nights ago.

They'll be rioting
in the streets.

38:37.920 --> 38:39.440
But there
has to be consequences.

38:39.480 --> 38:41.120
We'll pin this on the killer.

38:41.160 --> 38:43.560
We'll say he conned Wingate
into a bit of
private enterprise,

38:43.600 --> 38:44.960
faking his own death
without telling us.

If you do that, sir,
if there's no right or wrong,

38:48.520 --> 38:50.960
no consequences,
then what are we even
doing here?

already been made.

in less than a week.

You have no power, no autonomy.

There can't be exceptions
for any officer,
in any circumstance.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.160
That's what I thought.

39:04.200 --> 39:07.120
But these days,
it's all about optics.

39:08.360 --> 39:10.640
[Sighs in exasperation]

39:26.280 --> 39:30.120
I gave him the keys.
I told him not to come in
without a good reason.

39:30.160 --> 39:31.800
He just needed
the bathroom.

39:33.760 --> 39:36.560
So the killer switched out
the fake blood
for sulphuric acid,

39:36.600 --> 39:38.000

and Rose coming back.

Rose's story.

39:47.200 --> 39:48.840
He says he didn't call you,

39:48.880 --> 39:51.760
he says the killer used
a deep-fake to get you
out of the house.

39:51.800 --> 39:53.920
And the killer used my voice
to trick Rose.

39:53.960 --> 39:55.800
So, why would Rose lie
about that?

39:55.840 --> 39:57.240
If he made the call himself.

39:57.280 --> 39:58.840
What, at exactly the same time

39:58.880 --> 40:00.640
that the killer decides
to break in?

40:00.680 --> 40:01.840
What if it's not a coincidence?

40:01.880 --> 40:04.280

has an accomplice.

Rose is the accomplice?

who he went to see this morning,

a word he says.

right past you?
