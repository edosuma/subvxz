WEBVTT

00:05.405 --> 00:09.209
Geordie Shore is back in Newcastle.
Home sweet fucking home.

00:09.275 --> 00:12.679
(cheering)
We're back with a fucking boom.

00:15.215 --> 00:16.248
Get in!

00:20.787 --> 00:22.689
Come on.
And bang!

00:22.756 --> 00:26.126
I told you to shut the fuck up.
Fuck, Marnie's back.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.395
(Gary) Scott's gonna kick off.

00:30.163 --> 00:32.899
Sort yourself. Put bros before hos.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.901
She's standing dancing by herself.

00:34.968 --> 00:38.238
I'm starting to feel
really awful about it all.

00:38.304 --> 00:40.440
Scott can't have it all his own way.

00:43.176 --> 00:44.811
I can't trust her.

00:46.012 --> 00:47.480
Mitch is here!

00:47.547 --> 00:50.617
He could've turned up sober.
The kid's fucking smashed.

00:50.683 --> 00:55.088
Their first impression is that
he's a massive fucking bell-end.

00:57.390 --> 00:59.526
I never wanted it to end this way.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.899
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

01:05.965 --> 01:08.067
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:08.134 --> 01:10.570
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:10.637 --> 01:13.173
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:13.239 --> 01:15.442
I never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

01:15.508 --> 01:17.377
Hardest graft I do is doing me hair.

01:17.444 --> 01:20.013
I'm fit, flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:20.079 --> 01:22.482
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:36.296 --> 01:39.699
I can't believe last night.
I can.

01:39.766 --> 01:44.838
Me and Gary are having breakfast and
we feel so bad about what happened.

01:44.904 --> 01:48.608
Mitch was a prick. I can't believe
how much he upset Charlotte.

01:48.675 --> 01:51.344
Obviously he was drunk.
I don't care.

01:51.411 --> 01:53.279
That is not an excuse for anyone.

01:53.346 --> 01:58.251
He started calling everyone fucking
idiots, calling us all cunts.

01:58.318 --> 02:01.521
Honestly, at one point,
I was gonna fucking knock him out.

02:01.588 --> 02:05.291
That relationship is one-sided.
Charlotte came to London.

02:05.358 --> 02:07.927
All he's gotta do is be nice
and he can't.

02:07.994 --> 02:10.930
I couldn't believe
that she's chosen him over us.

02:10.997 --> 02:14.000
I know Charlotte
will be gutted about last night.

02:14.067 --> 02:18.905
I hope she comes back and explains
what went on, then we can move on.

02:21.674 --> 02:24.744
Me and Mitch are in the park.
I'm still angry.

02:24.811 --> 02:27.547
Mitch, you do realise
how drunk you were?

02:27.614 --> 02:29.749
Nah, I weren't that drunk.
You were.

02:29.816 --> 02:32.418
I weren't.
I couldn't even calm you down.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.255
You were flinging us around
like a yo-yo.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.224
What makes it worse
is Mitch can't remember anything.

02:38.291 --> 02:40.426
One minute you were saying
you loved us

02:40.493 --> 02:43.796
and the next you didn't want
to be anywhere near us.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.900
Everyone's probably gonna hate
Mitch now.

02:46.966 --> 02:48.768
I just look like a complete mug.

02:48.835 --> 02:52.105
Well, everyone probably thinks
I'm a dickhead, don't they?

02:52.171 --> 02:55.041
Holly was angry
so I'm dreading going back today.

02:55.108 --> 02:57.010
Well, tell Holly I'm sorry.

02:57.076 --> 03:00.780
I can't face seeing the others yet.
I need to go home.

03:00.847 --> 03:05.018
I'll see them at the house. I need
to prepare what I'm gonna say.

03:05.084 --> 03:06.419
Cos I love ya.

03:06.486 --> 03:09.088
I'm glad.
I'm glad you love us, mind.

03:10.490 --> 03:15.261
(Holly) After last night, I forget
that we now have to go rap jumping.

03:15.328 --> 03:19.365
Why would anyone want to go to the
top of a building and walk down it?

03:19.432 --> 03:21.301
That's just fucking plain stupid.

03:21.367 --> 03:25.038
This is 47 metres of tower.
We'll watch Colin do a demo jump.

03:25.104 --> 03:28.141
Oh, God.
Oh, my God.

03:28.207 --> 03:30.777
(screaming)
Oh, my God!

03:30.843 --> 03:32.445
That looks unreal.

03:32.512 --> 03:34.347
That looks so good.
Give us a go.

03:34.414 --> 03:36.082
Rap jumping is my bucket list.

03:36.149 --> 03:40.253
I'm gonna show everyone and dive off
this building like a fucking swan.

03:40.320 --> 03:43.923
I'm feeling sick looking up at it.
I can't do that, man.

03:43.990 --> 03:48.828
There's no chance I'm doing this.
I'd be sick all over meself.

03:48.895 --> 03:51.764
Holly's not doing it either
cos she hates everything.

03:51.831 --> 03:53.866
Oh, my God, it's so high.

03:53.933 --> 03:57.904
I can't wait to hoy meself over the
edge. Gaz looks like he's gonna cry.

03:57.971 --> 04:01.074
Don't worry, kid,
we'll paint your nails later.

04:02.642 --> 04:05.411
I honestly can't watch.
I'm running down!

04:05.478 --> 04:09.182
I'm running down a wall, for fuck's
sake. It feels fucking mint.

04:09.248 --> 04:11.184
Oh, my God.

04:13.286 --> 04:14.887
Let's do it, man.
Nah.

04:14.954 --> 04:18.291
Come on! Go on, Gary!

04:22.895 --> 04:24.497
Oh, my God.

04:24.564 --> 04:28.334
Shit. Scott's done it, Gary's done
it. There's no way I can't do it.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.969
Keep going, Marnie!

04:31.371 --> 04:34.774
I'm hanging here like a puppet,
looking like a fucking twat.

04:34.841 --> 04:36.009
(laughter)

04:38.044 --> 04:40.146
Thank fuck the rap jumping's over.

04:40.213 --> 04:44.550
I hope when we get back to the house
Charlotte's gonna be waiting for us.

04:48.855 --> 04:53.626
I'm on me way back and I'm so
worried. I need to phone me mam.

04:53.693 --> 04:56.696
She knows best.
Mams always know what to do.

04:56.763 --> 05:01.167
Everyone is gonna be talking about
it, saying that he's an arsehole.

05:01.234 --> 05:06.706
I just... I can't be bothered. It's
gonna be made into such a big deal.

05:06.773 --> 05:09.575
I hope Holly forgives us
and she understands.

05:09.642 --> 05:11.611
I don't want her to be mad.

05:11.678 --> 05:14.781
I don't want her to think
that I chose Mitch over her.

05:14.847 --> 05:17.450
Holly's already said stuff, Mam.

05:17.517 --> 05:20.787
Now I've gotta meet them.
They'll all be like, "I hate him".

05:20.853 --> 05:22.689
I don't want to hear that.

05:23.723 --> 05:26.959
Me mam's reassuring us that it's
gonna be fine when I go back

05:27.026 --> 05:28.494
and see the others.

05:28.561 --> 05:30.296
I just hope she's right.

05:40.473 --> 05:45.278
I'm on the settee and I can hear the
car pulling up and I'm so nervous.

05:51.684 --> 05:54.087
They come straight over
and give us a hug.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.256
I don't know why
I was ever so scared.

05:57.323 --> 06:00.059
It's all right.
Are you all right?

06:00.126 --> 06:02.862
Thank God Charlotte's there.

06:02.929 --> 06:06.499
I know she's upset,
but her boyfriend acted like a dick.

06:06.566 --> 06:09.268
All I was trying to do
was protect her.

06:09.335 --> 06:11.838
Don't worry.
Sorry for shouting at you.

06:15.775 --> 06:18.010
It's hard, watching Charlotte cry.

06:18.077 --> 06:20.747
It used to be me making her cry,
but I can make it OK.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.015
When it's someone else,
it kills us.

06:23.082 --> 06:28.387
I know what he did was bad. I'm not
making any excuses. He was an idiot.

06:28.454 --> 06:31.457
I just don't want you all
to hate him.

06:31.524 --> 06:35.561
The last thing I want is them
to think bad of me relationship

06:35.628 --> 06:40.066
cos I really love Mitch and I really
wish things had gone differently.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.001
(phone rings)

06:43.269 --> 06:45.505
(sighs) Oh, God. Hello?

06:45.571 --> 06:47.807
"Hi, Holly."
Hi, Anna.

06:47.874 --> 06:49.542
"I've got a job for you."

06:49.609 --> 06:54.714
Anna tell us we've got to work at
the Bucking Bronco and I hate her.

06:57.049 --> 06:59.919
Are you going to work with anyone?
You.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.888
You. No!
You.

07:01.954 --> 07:03.322
(laughter)

07:03.389 --> 07:06.225
Anna says me, Holly and Gary
are at work.

07:06.292 --> 07:08.161
I hope Mitch isn't brought up

07:08.227 --> 07:11.664
cos I can't fight his corner
any more than I already have.

07:16.235 --> 07:18.437
Lately I've been rooshing the drink

07:18.504 --> 07:20.907
so I'm gonna stop in
and watch The Notebook.

07:29.849 --> 07:31.517
I do like Scott.

07:31.584 --> 07:36.322
But he doesn't know where his head's
at, so how am I supposed to know?

07:37.223 --> 07:38.991
Bye, everyone!

07:53.072 --> 07:56.976
Perfect job, helping the girls get
their leg over the bucking bronco.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.946
I'm just looking at
their fucking knickers. Result.

08:11.524 --> 08:14.026
It's killing Charlotte,
what happened.

08:14.093 --> 08:17.830
I just wanna make sure
her and Mitch are actually OK.

08:23.135 --> 08:26.239
Gary's telling us that he didn't
like seeing us upset.

08:26.305 --> 08:30.943
That's rich. He made us like that
for two years. He wasn't arsed then.

08:36.682 --> 08:41.386
I know Gary will be loving that my
boyfriend treat us bad. I hate it.

08:41.453 --> 08:44.557
If anyone, I wanted to prove
to Gary that I was happy now,

08:44.624 --> 08:46.025
I was totally over him.

08:53.399 --> 08:56.802
Me and James get to Tup Tup.
I'm buzzing that I'm not at work.

09:04.477 --> 09:07.079
James is surprised
I didn't stay with Scott.

09:07.146 --> 09:09.215
But Scott wouldn't do that for me.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.328
What's going on
between Scott and Marnie?

09:22.395 --> 09:25.164
One minute they're saying
they like each other,

09:25.231 --> 09:29.368
the next they want to neck on with
other people. I've had enough of it.

09:32.838 --> 09:35.641
I can hear Holly and Gary
talking about Mitch.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.843
I'm standing right here.

09:43.549 --> 09:46.185
Charlotte's put pressure
on herself with Mitch

09:46.252 --> 09:48.921
cos she wanted everything
to go perfectly,

09:48.988 --> 09:50.856
but he shouldn't have been a dick.

09:50.923 --> 09:53.125
That's not what I want
for my best friend.

09:58.798 --> 10:02.601
I've had enough. Everyone's acted
like a drunken dickhead before.

10:02.668 --> 10:05.304
Why are they still
slagging off Mitch?

10:10.643 --> 10:14.547
Thank fuck work's done. Time to hit
Tup Tup and have a good night.

10:19.318 --> 10:23.255
Everyone's here. Time to get mortal
and have a fucking mint night.

10:29.362 --> 10:31.697
We're in the club
and me mind's on Mitch.

10:31.764 --> 10:35.835
Me head's not in this. I can't
stop thinking about anything else.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.176
I didn't think Charlotte
would come back.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.712
Hope she doesn't beat herself up
about it.

10:58.024 --> 11:01.327
Holly's still talking about Mitch.
I can't deal with this.

11:01.394 --> 11:04.397
I can't stay while they're
slagging off me boyfriend.

11:04.463 --> 11:06.265
I know they're not gonna stop.

11:16.642 --> 11:21.180
I can't stay with them saying awful
things about him. It just kills us.

11:21.247 --> 11:24.717
I don't want to be the girl
who's got a horrible boyfriend

11:24.784 --> 11:28.454
and I don't wanna be the girl who
has to sit there and listen to them

11:28.521 --> 11:32.124
and know they're all talking
about us behind me back.

11:47.440 --> 11:52.244
I feel so torn between everyone in
the Geordie Shore house and Mitch.

11:52.311 --> 11:55.748
I don't wanna leave them all,
but I can't have them talk about

11:55.815 --> 11:58.684
someone who I care about so much
in bad ways.

12:09.428 --> 12:12.331
I can't see Charlotte.
She's disappeared.

12:13.999 --> 12:17.536
Marnie's telling me
that Charlotte's still really upset

12:17.603 --> 12:20.606
cos she thinks everyone's
still slagging off Mitch.

12:32.118 --> 12:36.489
I feel like I've said something
to upset her. I just hope not.

12:41.026 --> 12:45.831
Fuck this, we need to go back to the
house and find out what's going on.

12:52.238 --> 12:55.975
I don't know whether I can ever come
back to the Geordie Shore house.

12:56.041 --> 12:59.445
I'm writing the note
because I want Holly to know

12:59.512 --> 13:04.416
I haven't left her by herself cos
I feel so guilty for having to go.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.318
I just hope she understands.

13:17.730 --> 13:19.532
I finally thought I was happy.

13:19.598 --> 13:22.735
The last thing I want
is for them all to hate me.

13:22.801 --> 13:25.237
I really wish
things had gone differently.

13:30.776 --> 13:33.946
(sobs) She's gone.

13:34.013 --> 13:36.949
I'm genuinely lost.
Charlotte is my soul mate.

13:37.016 --> 13:40.853
I'm probably make her squirt
all over the fucking shop.

13:40.920 --> 13:43.589
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

13:43.656 --> 13:43.722
.

13:48.394 --> 13:48.594
.

13:55.801 --> 13:59.205
I don't know whether
I can ever come back to the house.

13:59.271 --> 14:00.839
I thought I was happy.

14:00.906 --> 14:03.943
The last thing I want
is for them all to hate me.

14:04.009 --> 14:06.412
I really wish
things had gone differently.

14:09.949 --> 14:12.384
We need to find out what's going on.

14:12.451 --> 14:17.056
Why would she run out of a club
and not tell us where she's going?

14:31.270 --> 14:33.005
I get back to the house...

14:35.407 --> 14:36.942
...and there's this letter.

14:37.009 --> 14:38.377
Ah, no.
Oh, no.

14:38.444 --> 14:40.446
No, no, no, no.

14:40.512 --> 14:42.314
(cries)

14:44.316 --> 14:46.252
What's wrong?
(sobs)

14:48.254 --> 14:49.455
Letter, man.

14:50.856 --> 14:52.157
She's gone.

15:00.065 --> 15:04.436
No-one in that house has a fucking
clue how devastated me and Holly is.

15:04.503 --> 15:07.406
Charlotte literally is my soul mate.

15:07.473 --> 15:10.643
For her to leave...
I'm genuinely lost.

15:17.082 --> 15:21.387
I feel like
I am partly responsible for it.

15:21.453 --> 15:24.056
I just can't believe
she's just gone.

15:26.025 --> 15:28.560
Scott's got to be asleep in there.

15:28.627 --> 15:31.263
I can't believe Charlotte's
actually left.

15:31.330 --> 15:32.865
Scott was in the house.

15:32.931 --> 15:35.567
If he was awake,
he maybes could've stopped her.

15:43.475 --> 15:45.778
Charlotte loves Mitch so much.

15:45.844 --> 15:48.347
I am being selfish,
wanting her to be there,

15:48.414 --> 15:50.549
but she's my best friend.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.851
I feel completely heart-broken.

15:55.988 --> 15:59.091
It does go through my head,
what if I'd got with Charlotte?

15:59.158 --> 16:02.294
What if I could've made her
the happiest girl in the world?

16:02.361 --> 16:06.932
It keeps replaying over and over
in my head... what if?

16:19.912 --> 16:24.083
So I've woken up in this massive room
and I'm completely by myself.

16:24.149 --> 16:26.719
Charlotte's not here.
I'm absolutely gutted.

16:26.785 --> 16:30.589
She just disappeared.
We came back and she's left a note.

16:30.656 --> 16:33.058
She just disappeared?
Mm-hmm.

16:33.125 --> 16:35.828
Marnie woke us up
and tells us Charlotte's left.

16:35.894 --> 16:38.897
I must've been flat out
cos I would've stopped her.

16:38.964 --> 16:42.067
I still can't believe
that last night Charlotte left

16:42.134 --> 16:44.570
and now there's just the five of us.

16:44.636 --> 16:46.839
(sighs) Fucking hell.

16:46.905 --> 16:50.542
What's the craic?
Just feeding the chickens.

16:50.609 --> 16:53.779
I feel like Rachel and Elizabeth
are really sad right now

16:53.846 --> 16:56.849
because they're looking
for Charlotte. They miss her.

16:56.915 --> 16:59.518
I don't know how much
I'm supposed to feed them.

16:59.585 --> 17:01.820
She didn't leave me any guidelines.

17:01.887 --> 17:06.125
There's only two days left.
Try and end it on a high.

17:06.191 --> 17:08.127
Try and make the most of it.

17:14.031 --> 17:16.201
Marnie still had the chance
to meet Kate

17:16.268 --> 17:20.105
so we're gonna go to the beach
together, a little double date.

17:25.444 --> 17:28.747
Ah, that's good. Double date?

17:30.048 --> 17:31.650
I'm excited to meet her.

17:31.717 --> 17:34.286
James is calling this a double date.

17:34.353 --> 17:37.790
Not everyone's got a ball and chain
round their ankle like you.

17:45.597 --> 17:46.665
Hi.

17:46.732 --> 17:48.233
You all right?
Yeah.

17:50.135 --> 17:53.405
It's like a little couple's day
out now. I know.

18:00.145 --> 18:03.882
Me and Kate are absolutely smashing
Scott and Marnie at volleyball.

18:03.949 --> 18:06.718
Guess who's the new dream team?
Bosh.

18:15.194 --> 18:17.329
Yeah, very... close.

18:26.772 --> 18:30.409
So are you gonna pull tonight
or not? Don't know.

18:30.476 --> 18:35.414
I do feel like if Scott doesn't pull
a girl tonight, I might put out.

18:35.481 --> 18:37.683
Will you rub some oil on me back
for us?

18:37.749 --> 18:42.187
I tell you what,
I'll put oil on you in bed, lube.

18:42.254 --> 18:44.089
Marnie's asking for a massage.

18:44.156 --> 18:48.093
Knowing how good I am I'll make her
squirt all over the fucking shop.

18:48.160 --> 18:50.629
That's too much!
It's not, man.

18:50.696 --> 18:51.930
Very romantic.

18:53.131 --> 18:55.067
I thought it was romantic.

19:00.038 --> 19:02.608
Fuck!
(laughs)

19:15.120 --> 19:17.890
Lads, I need your help tonight.

19:17.956 --> 19:20.058
Tonight I want Scott all to meself.

19:20.125 --> 19:23.862
I'll ask James and Gary to help us.
It's Operation Wingman Marnie.

19:23.929 --> 19:27.132
I don't want Scott to pull.
Right. Ooh.

19:27.199 --> 19:31.637
I have a feeling he's gonna. Gary,
talk to every girl he tries to pull.

19:31.703 --> 19:34.339
Cock-block him?
Cock-block the fuck out of him.

19:34.406 --> 19:37.309
My night out?
Dedicate it to Marnie and Scott.

19:37.376 --> 19:41.246
James, tell him how amazing I am,
much better than these girls.

19:41.313 --> 19:43.882
I'd do that anyway,
wouldn't I, Marnie?

19:43.949 --> 19:47.819
Gaz is gonna cock-block and
I'm gonna big Marnie up to Scott.

19:47.886 --> 19:52.057
I might put out before we leave
the house if he doesn't pull.

19:52.124 --> 19:55.761
Fucking hell, all of his hard work
might pay off. Yeah.

19:55.827 --> 19:59.865
I like Scott still and if he
doesn't pull, I might put out.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.368
Yay!

20:09.107 --> 20:13.211
We're playing beer pong, but instead
of beer we're using tequila.

20:13.278 --> 20:16.682
This is only gonna end up one way,
fucking mortal.

20:20.352 --> 20:24.022
Tonight we're hitting Bijoux
and I know Charlotte's not there,

20:24.089 --> 20:27.492
but she'd want me to get mortal
and have a good time for her.

20:38.203 --> 20:41.607
If somebody said that it'd be just me
and Marnie left at the end,

20:41.673 --> 20:44.242
I would've told them
to go fuck themselves.

20:46.311 --> 20:49.548
It's time to get Operation
Wingman Marnie into action.

20:59.191 --> 21:02.694
Everyone's banging on about Marnie.
It's scrambling me brain.

21:02.761 --> 21:05.030
I wanna get smashed
and see what happens.

21:14.439 --> 21:17.943
I'm talking to Gary.
We agree the plan is going well.

21:18.010 --> 21:21.013
Scott isn't talking to girls.
So far so good.

21:35.093 --> 21:39.064
It's never gonna work. Scott is so
scared of admitting he likes Marnie.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.733
He doesn't wanna lose his lad title
and not pull.

21:50.609 --> 21:54.846
Scott's talking to girls, meaning
James and Gaz have failed miserably.

21:54.913 --> 21:58.550
Me and Holly are gonna have to get
involved and do the cock-blocking.

22:17.602 --> 22:20.405
I'm not sure whether shagging
Marnie's a good idea

22:20.472 --> 22:23.575
cos she'll fall in love
and it'll make things complicated.

22:28.413 --> 22:31.483
The girls have left
and Scott didn't pull anyone.

22:31.550 --> 22:34.286
Operation Wingman Marnie
was a success.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.334
(burps)

22:49.401 --> 22:52.537
I've had a good night.
I'm absolutely mortal.

22:52.604 --> 22:55.073
I feel like right now
all I need is me bed.

23:01.947 --> 23:06.284
I need a girl's advice.
The closest thing I've got is James.

23:11.256 --> 23:15.360
That's fucking weird. I don't even
know how to answer that one, like.

23:15.427 --> 23:18.430
Marnie's talking to us
like I'm one of her girlfriends.

23:30.675 --> 23:34.179
I haven't got a clue
what she's talking about.

23:34.246 --> 23:36.815
So Scott didn't pull tonight.

23:36.882 --> 23:40.152
If he can do the same tomorrow,
there'll be a happy ending.

23:42.154 --> 23:46.625
How the fuck are you meant
to wear it? Like this. Cock.

23:48.360 --> 23:51.096
Scott's ran away
cos he saw Marnie kiss another boy.

23:51.163 --> 23:54.166
Go home to your mammy.
So much for family night.

23:54.232 --> 23:56.668
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

23:56.735 --> 23:56.802
.

24:01.773 --> 24:01.973
.

24:16.922 --> 24:19.558
Me and Marnie have ended up
spooning most nights.

24:19.624 --> 24:23.428
Tonight's our last night. I wonder
if she'll accept the fucking length.

24:26.198 --> 24:30.135
So tonight is the last night.
We need to look amazing.

24:30.202 --> 24:32.871
We're going shopping
to get something nice.

24:41.847 --> 24:45.016
You do know that the last night's
a family night?

24:45.083 --> 24:46.484
What does that mean?

24:46.551 --> 24:50.722
Like, the lads can't pull,
the girls can't pull.

24:50.789 --> 24:54.626
I wasn't gonna pull anyway.
You're allowed to pull each other.

24:54.693 --> 24:58.697
The last night in the Geordie Shore
house means it's family night.

24:58.763 --> 25:01.366
I'll stick to that plan
if Scott does.

25:01.433 --> 25:02.467
Found stuff?

25:02.534 --> 25:04.135
I'm gonna get these.
Nice.

25:04.202 --> 25:07.138
I've spoke to Marnie
and she completely gets it.

25:07.205 --> 25:11.943
There's no pulling and that's final.
I just hope the boys get it for once.

25:16.882 --> 25:19.484
(doorbell)

25:21.853 --> 25:23.054
Hello.

25:23.121 --> 25:26.925
It's our last night. Anna turns up.
Is she having a fucking laugh?

25:26.992 --> 25:30.428
Hi. You'll be pleased
it's the last job of the summer.

25:30.495 --> 25:36.167
You're making us work on the last
night? Yes, all three lads. OK?

25:36.234 --> 25:39.371
Anna's telling us that the boys
have to go to work tonight.

25:39.437 --> 25:44.175
Usually we're together as a family,
and now she's just fucked it up.

25:44.242 --> 25:47.646
And you will be wearing these.
It's non-negotiable.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.983
Oh, you can fuck off.
Is that a thong?

25:52.050 --> 25:54.853
Wear it in the limo.
Are you fucking kidding?

25:54.920 --> 25:57.389
She wants us to wear a thong.

25:57.455 --> 26:00.358
If she wanted to see me ball-sack,
she should've asked.

26:00.425 --> 26:05.263
We're dressing like tits and getting
sent to work, on our last night.

26:05.330 --> 26:06.865
Bye.
(all) Bye.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.834
I was gonna say cheers, Anna,
but...

26:15.273 --> 26:17.342
Are you wearing yours?
Don't know.

26:17.409 --> 26:20.178
It doesn't really fit.
It's a medium.

26:20.245 --> 26:22.847
There's no way I'll fit my chod
in that thong.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.849
I'll get done for packing pure heat.

26:24.916 --> 26:28.253
How the fuck are you meant
to wear it? Like this.

26:28.320 --> 26:29.487
Alright, ladies?

26:29.554 --> 26:30.889
Hey, knock-knock.

26:30.956 --> 26:34.826
Scott's being a pussy
and James' arse's is too fat.

26:34.893 --> 26:37.162
Cock. (laughs)

26:37.228 --> 26:41.166
Do you wanna sniff these ones
like you did with Marnie's? What?

26:41.232 --> 26:43.368
James!
(laughs) Oops.

26:43.435 --> 26:44.769
What the fuck?

26:44.836 --> 26:48.306
Scott's been sniffing me knickers?
The scruffy twat.

26:48.373 --> 26:50.275
All right?
What's happening?

26:54.145 --> 26:56.848
To the fucking lads.
To the lads.

26:56.915 --> 26:59.250
We're pumped up,
ready for work tonight.

26:59.317 --> 27:02.787
We get there and it's a 25th
birthday party, buzzing.

27:02.854 --> 27:05.423
We need to show them a good time.

27:05.490 --> 27:08.460
It's Claire's birthday,
let's get fucking smashed.

27:08.526 --> 27:10.428
I'll put me cock in her face later.

27:10.495 --> 27:12.163
(cheering)
Cheers!

27:18.603 --> 27:22.707
Scott didn't pull last night
so he's definitely in with a chance.

27:27.345 --> 27:29.347
I'm shaving me fairy for Scott.

27:29.414 --> 27:33.485
It's had no attention for ages
and me mam said always be prepared.

27:43.928 --> 27:47.499
Marnie is dry-shaving her fairy
in the room next to me.

27:47.565 --> 27:49.634
I don't think I can deal with this.

27:57.642 --> 28:02.947
Me and Holly are glammed up to the
max. Shot of tequila and we're out.

28:03.014 --> 28:07.786
To the last night and to your shaven
fairy not going to waste. Lovely.

28:17.295 --> 28:19.664
This bus has been fucking mental.

28:19.731 --> 28:22.667
It's time to hit Indigo
and let the party games begin.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.388
Scott and Gaz are firing ice
at each other.

28:43.455 --> 28:47.125
Time to leave before they end up
necking on with each other.

28:48.726 --> 28:51.262
We've shown these girls
an amazing time.

28:51.329 --> 28:53.398
It's time to hit the club.

28:53.465 --> 28:56.868
(roars)
(roars)

28:56.935 --> 28:59.104
I think we might be
a little bit pissed.

28:59.170 --> 29:00.805
Fucking right!

29:08.713 --> 29:12.283
Me and Marnie are in the club,
waiting for the boys to arrive,

29:12.350 --> 29:14.185
so that family night can begin.

29:28.233 --> 29:31.669
I'm so happy Holly's telling us
I'm part of the family

29:31.736 --> 29:36.307
cos she never thought she could see
that happening. I'm over the moon.

29:43.481 --> 29:48.720
We finally get to the club. Time to
kick off and get fucking mortal.

29:54.559 --> 29:58.863
Scott's avoiding us. I'm dancing
on me own. I don't know what's up.

30:04.869 --> 30:08.439
I see Scott and he's talking
to girls. I've fucking had enough.

30:17.115 --> 30:21.452
Marnie, I explained family night
and you don't seem to be getting it.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.589
Scott's talking to girls.
You don't have to rise to it.

30:24.656 --> 30:26.491
You look like a fucking mug.

30:30.962 --> 30:33.998
Cos these birds are all over me
Marnie's got desperate

30:34.065 --> 30:38.336
and necks on with some other lad.
He's nowt compared to me.

30:52.283 --> 30:55.486
So Scott's kicked off.
Fucking hell, all this over a girl.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.989
We've never seen this side
of Scott before.

31:09.968 --> 31:13.838
Scott hasn't got the brain or the
balls to pull off banging Marnie.

31:13.905 --> 31:15.306
It's not happening.

31:15.373 --> 31:18.910
Marnie is fucking with me head.
I can't trust her again.

31:23.715 --> 31:27.318
My head is completely battered
so fuck it, I'm off home.

31:41.633 --> 31:45.303
So Scott's ran away
cos he saw Marnie kiss another boy.

31:45.370 --> 31:47.472
What the fuck?
OK, go home to your mammy.

31:51.509 --> 31:54.579
I look over at Gary
and he's necking on with this girl.

31:54.646 --> 31:58.016
There's nobody left in this house
who cares about the family.

31:58.082 --> 31:59.484
I'm completely alone.

32:10.161 --> 32:13.965
Gary comes over cos I'm crying.
I'm like, "What are you doing?"

32:14.032 --> 32:17.435
"You don't even wanna be here.
You'd rather be necking on."

32:23.207 --> 32:25.677
This is just a complete fucking mess

32:25.743 --> 32:28.646
and all I wanna do now is go home.

32:30.448 --> 32:31.849
So much for family night.

32:34.118 --> 32:36.254
I wanted us to be a family.

32:36.321 --> 32:40.024
If I was gonna get with anyone,
it was going to be Scott.

32:40.091 --> 32:42.660
Then I seen him talking to girls
and I thought,

32:42.727 --> 32:46.164
"If Scott's doing it,
I'm gonna do it." Then he walks out.

32:46.230 --> 32:50.735
I don't give a fuck about anyone
right now. This isn't a family.

32:50.802 --> 32:52.937
Everyone can seriously fucking do one

32:53.004 --> 32:55.807
cos you're all giving me
a bastard fucking headache.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.250
I get home and all I wanna do
is go straight to bed.

33:06.317 --> 33:10.455
Everyone else in this house
is so selfish.

33:10.521 --> 33:14.292
All they care about is pulling
or getting one over on each other.

33:14.359 --> 33:17.895
That's not what family is.
They actually don't give a fuck.

33:17.962 --> 33:20.064
Holly storms off. Scott's not here.

33:20.131 --> 33:23.568
At least Marnie's up for it.
We get in the hot tub,

33:23.634 --> 33:25.703
get pissed,
we're gonna have a laugh.

33:26.871 --> 33:28.840
Gaz and Marnie are in the hot tub.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.409
Marnie's after a bang
on her last night.

33:31.476 --> 33:35.813
Scott's not here so Gaz will have
to do. We all know he won't say no.

33:37.115 --> 33:42.120
When you're smashed and a girl's
in underwear, it is tempting.

33:42.186 --> 33:45.456
Resisting Marnie is one of
the hardest things I've done.

33:45.523 --> 33:47.692
Everyone knows how much I love girls.

33:53.231 --> 33:57.468
I wouldn't do it to Scott. He better
realise what a good friend I am.

33:58.770 --> 34:00.972
(horn sounds)
Oh, fuck!

34:01.038 --> 34:05.543
Shock, Scott's bouncing over like
Tigger with a stick up his arse.

34:05.610 --> 34:08.045
I wanna leave whatever we've had.
(cheering)

34:08.112 --> 34:12.784
This might actually be an OK end
to this whole disaster. (cheering)

34:12.850 --> 34:15.219
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

34:15.286 --> 34:15.353
.

34:20.324 --> 34:20.525
.

34:35.039 --> 34:37.241
I'm so hungover this morning.

34:37.308 --> 34:41.078
Last night was absolutely terrible.
I was completely on my own.

34:41.145 --> 34:44.282
This whole "family" night
didn't even exist.

34:44.348 --> 34:47.685
Oh, my God. I'm so ill.
I'm fucking ill.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.687
Last night was a fucking disaster.

34:49.754 --> 34:53.291
It wasn't family night at all
and Scott isn't anywhere to be seen.

34:53.357 --> 34:56.159
You were cracking on with lads.
Scott was with birds.

34:56.226 --> 35:01.599
The only reason I pulled was cos
he was trying again to pull girls.

35:01.666 --> 35:03.501
Fair enough.

35:03.568 --> 35:08.139
He can fuck off. I don't know what
the future holds for me and Scott.

35:08.206 --> 35:12.743
I'm gutted. I thought it'd be about
me and Scott finally getting it on.

35:12.810 --> 35:17.482
Today we've got to do one last
bucket list thing. What is it?

35:17.548 --> 35:20.618
I'm not gonna tell you,
but it's gonna be mint.

35:20.685 --> 35:22.854
I'm actually gonna be sick.

35:22.920 --> 35:24.388
It's our last day.

35:24.455 --> 35:28.125
I'm not leaving here without everyone
happy, so I'm ringing Scott.

35:28.192 --> 35:31.229
(phone rings)
"Hello?"

35:31.295 --> 35:32.563
Oi-oi.

35:40.571 --> 35:45.843
Shock, he can't remember, he was too
pissed. Now it's all fine and dandy.

35:45.910 --> 35:47.311
Get ready and...

35:49.347 --> 35:54.585
It's our last day. I've chartered a
luxury yacht to cruise down the Tyne.

36:00.525 --> 36:02.593
All right, everyone.

36:04.529 --> 36:06.631
Oh, my God, it's lush.

36:09.800 --> 36:13.538
(Holly) I'm actually quite happy
about it. It looks amazing.

36:13.604 --> 36:16.807
This might actually be
an OK end to this whole disaster.

36:16.874 --> 36:18.843
Anchor up, full steam ahead.

36:18.910 --> 36:20.945
What is it?

36:21.012 --> 36:22.013
Aye, go on.

36:22.079 --> 36:23.414
(horn sounds)
Oh, fuck!

36:25.283 --> 36:27.118
There he is.

36:27.184 --> 36:31.122
Shock, Scott's bouncing over like
Tigger with a stick up his arse.

36:31.188 --> 36:35.326
This is fucking sexy as fuck.
Where the fuck did you go, then?

36:35.393 --> 36:36.394
I'm so sorry.

36:38.796 --> 36:40.665
This time has been a head fuck.

36:40.731 --> 36:43.801
I've been at my house
as much as the Geordie Shore house.

36:43.868 --> 36:46.737
I need to stop doing off
every time there's trouble.

36:46.804 --> 36:48.639
What happened last night, then?

36:50.575 --> 36:52.076
I didn't see you.

36:53.477 --> 36:55.947
Scott pretends
he can't remember anything.

36:56.013 --> 36:59.183
I know you're pissed off
cos Marnie pulled another lad.

36:59.250 --> 37:01.385
I literally can't remember anything.

37:01.452 --> 37:02.720
Surprise, surprise.

37:02.787 --> 37:06.624
Scott's came back with
a fucking smug smile on his face.

37:06.691 --> 37:08.960
He's not getting away with it.

37:09.026 --> 37:12.797
We've got this for one day
so we're gonna blast down the Tyne,

37:12.863 --> 37:16.167
go to the beach, go swimming.
It's the last day.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.708
I wanna make sure Marnie
isn't angry with me.

37:23.774 --> 37:25.643
I wanna smooth things over.

37:25.710 --> 37:29.847
I just wanna leave whatever we've
had cos it's not going anywhere.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.415
It's just a head fuck.

37:31.482 --> 37:36.220
Scott won't change. All he cares
about is being in the dream team.

37:36.287 --> 37:40.091
I do actually like you. You're
a lush girl. I think you're mint.

37:40.157 --> 37:42.760
But your actions,
I can't deal with them.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.262
I was never gonna trust Marnie.

37:45.329 --> 37:48.599
She plays too many games.
She flirts with my mates.

37:48.666 --> 37:50.701
I'm not gonna mug myself off.

37:50.768 --> 37:54.305
Let's just agree to be friends,
nothing more from now on.

37:54.372 --> 37:55.840
No more flirting.

37:57.842 --> 38:01.946
I'm gutted me and Scott didn't work
out because I did really like him.

38:02.013 --> 38:05.116
But if we can't be together,
I'm hoping we can be friends.

38:14.025 --> 38:16.694
I'll have some lobster, like.
Oh, it stinks.

38:16.761 --> 38:19.563
Eugh!
Eugh!

38:19.630 --> 38:22.933
How the fuck...?
(screams)

38:23.000 --> 38:24.802
Pop my cork, Scotty.

38:27.371 --> 38:31.008
After last night I thought the
family was broken, but the yacht,

38:31.075 --> 38:35.046
we've pieced it all back together.
I'll be sad to say goodbye.

38:35.112 --> 38:36.714
Well done, everyone.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.351
(cheering)

38:42.953 --> 38:45.756
The yacht was an amazing idea
for the last day.

38:45.823 --> 38:49.627
Now it's back to the house, pack
and fuck off. It's all over again.

38:58.669 --> 39:03.507
Today on that yacht we were having
a good time. Nothing can break us.

39:03.574 --> 39:06.444
We have actually come back
as a family.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.745
One more.

39:13.084 --> 39:14.185
Packed.

39:16.153 --> 39:19.857
Been fucking mint this time.
See you later.

39:19.924 --> 39:20.925
Sweet.

39:20.991 --> 39:26.063
The best thing this time around,
by far, was the whole bucket list.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.003
Have some of that, water,
you bell-end.

39:33.070 --> 39:34.605
(cheering)

39:34.672 --> 39:36.640
I've got one! I've got one!

39:39.443 --> 39:41.746
I'm shitting meself.
It's so exciting.

39:41.812 --> 39:43.481
I'm flying!

39:43.547 --> 39:45.216
(cheering)

39:50.554 --> 39:53.324
This time around,
it's been fucking mental.

39:53.390 --> 39:56.761
There's been loads of highs,
loads of lows and loads of drama.

39:56.827 --> 39:58.329
But I love it.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.466
You off?
Yes.

40:02.533 --> 40:04.135
(both) I'll miss you.

40:05.436 --> 40:08.706
Me and Holly have been through
a lot of shit.

40:08.773 --> 40:13.277
I'm just pleased we've sorted it
out. I think it's a fucking miracle.

40:13.344 --> 40:17.214
Yes, I am intimidated.
She's fucking gorgeous.

40:18.249 --> 40:20.651
So Marnie and Scott are kissing.

40:20.718 --> 40:25.456
I'm watching Marnie's hanging gammon
being slapped around Gary's face.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.425
Everyone's fucking kicking off.
Oh, shit!

40:29.727 --> 40:31.762
She goes or I fucking go!

40:31.829 --> 40:34.398
She's came in
and fucking ruined it all.

40:34.465 --> 40:36.167
I told you to shut the fuck up!

40:36.233 --> 40:37.635
It's my birthday!

40:44.108 --> 40:46.110
Buzzing. I'm over the cock-fright.

40:49.146 --> 40:52.283
We may have had our ups and downs.
We have gone through a lot.

40:52.349 --> 40:56.253
Even though I say I hate them most
of the time, I am sad to be going.

40:58.889 --> 41:02.526
I knew walking into the Geordie
Shore house was gonna be hard,

41:02.593 --> 41:04.628
but I didn't realise quite how hard.

41:06.564 --> 41:08.465
It's Marnie!

41:08.532 --> 41:11.769
Gary is really good-looking,
but I'm looking at Scott

41:11.836 --> 41:14.572
and it's making us
get fanny flutter already.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.876
I just wanna pure blast her.

41:22.279 --> 41:25.683
She's a massive flirty slag
with really long, confusing hair.

41:27.251 --> 41:29.687
I ain't coming back.
You're a little slut!

41:29.753 --> 41:33.023
Fuck, Marnie's back.
You stupid little scumbag!

41:33.090 --> 41:37.027
I'm not gonna let them girls push
us out. She's dancing by herself.

41:37.094 --> 41:40.865
This is us making up.
I am so embarrassed and humiliated.

41:42.466 --> 41:45.703
I've finally been accepted
as part of the family.

41:45.769 --> 41:50.374
I've enjoyed every minute and I
wouldn't change it for the world.

41:50.441 --> 41:54.345
Now I look back after all the drama,
I think next time...

41:54.411 --> 41:56.680
Dream Team back.
Full on.

41:56.747 --> 42:00.784
Me and Gary ended up arguing over a
girl. That's never happened before.

42:00.851 --> 42:02.486
It should never happen again.

42:02.553 --> 42:06.123
She's fucked you off
with your so-called best friend.

42:06.190 --> 42:08.893
It's the most tested
our friendship's ever been.

42:08.959 --> 42:11.462
That looked weird.
What?

42:11.528 --> 42:16.667
I've got a fucking 'nother girl. The
shagging crown is back on my head.

42:20.104 --> 42:22.907
He's on the verge
of getting a fucking slap.

42:22.973 --> 42:27.077
Hopefully I don't knock him out.
Scott's gonna kick off World War 19.

42:30.080 --> 42:33.584
Start putting bros before hos
or you'll end up with no mates.

42:38.522 --> 42:41.592
We're all good now
and the fucking Dream Team lives on.

42:44.428 --> 42:46.931
Fuck me, that was mental.

42:46.997 --> 42:48.766
(cheering)

42:50.734 --> 42:53.304
We're gonna get mortal, shock.

42:58.442 --> 43:00.210
You're in for a treat, pal.

43:06.250 --> 43:08.953
At least we've had an amazing night.
Ha!

43:13.891 --> 43:14.892
Get in!

43:19.830 --> 43:20.931
Standard craic.

43:26.036 --> 43:27.404
(vomits)

43:27.471 --> 43:29.340
Egg's dead.

43:29.406 --> 43:32.676
(all) Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.
Oh, my God!

44:10.814 --> 44:11.015
.
