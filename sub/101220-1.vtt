00:51.318 --> 00:52.619
I'm telling you, Addie,

00:52.686 --> 00:54.654
if we build these factories
in San Miguel,

00:54.722 --> 00:56.858
the business is going
through the roof.

00:56.924 --> 00:59.961
<i>I'd rather have you
than the money.</i>

01:00.027 --> 01:02.797
<i>You're away too much, Slade,
and I...</i>

01:04.965 --> 01:05.967
<i>You okay?</i>

01:07.534 --> 01:10.303
When you're home,
when we're all together,

01:10.370 --> 01:12.439
I never even think about it.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.574
But as soon
as you're away, I...

01:26.120 --> 01:29.322
For God's sake, Addie,
Cambodia was years ago.

01:29.389 --> 01:31.259
Before we were even married.

01:31.324 --> 01:32.827
<i>We were in love.</i>

01:32.894 --> 01:34.729
<i>We were engaged.</i>

01:34.796 --> 01:36.429
And we've both
seen enough combat

01:36.496 --> 01:38.698
to know that however much
wounds may heal...

01:40.667 --> 01:42.435
How could you do this to me?

01:42.502 --> 01:43.805
I trusted you.

01:50.577 --> 01:52.379
<i>...the scars never go away.</i>

01:54.215 --> 01:55.216
Can I talk to him?

01:55.283 --> 01:57.651
I know. I know.

01:57.718 --> 02:00.888
And I swear to you, Addie,
I haven't lied to you since.

02:00.955 --> 02:02.824
And I will never
lie to you again.

02:03.623 --> 02:04.926
You believe me, don't you?

02:05.559 --> 02:06.660
Of course I do.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.395
- It's just...
- Can I talk?

02:09.931 --> 02:11.833
<i>Somebody wants you.</i>

02:11.899 --> 02:14.135
- I wonder who.
- <i>Hi, Papa.</i>

02:14.202 --> 02:15.837
Hey, buddy. Teeth all brushed?

02:16.336 --> 02:17.404
Yeah.

02:19.140 --> 02:20.041
Read to me.

02:20.107 --> 02:21.341
I would, Joe,

02:21.408 --> 02:22.810
but I'm late for
a dinner meeting and...

02:22.877 --> 02:24.045
Just a little.

02:25.947 --> 02:26.914
A little little.

02:27.347 --> 02:28.415
Hmm?

02:34.789 --> 02:37.591
<i>"The land
was filled with dragons</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.160
<i>and the people were afraid.</i>

02:39.227 --> 02:41.729
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>

02:41.796 --> 02:44.165
<i>to protect both man and maid.</i>

02:44.232 --> 02:48.435
<i>He faced the fiercest creatures
that the world had ever known.</i>

02:48.501 --> 02:50.403
<i>And he did it without any help.</i>

02:50.470 --> 02:52.139
<i>He did it all alone.</i>

02:52.206 --> 02:56.476
<i>And when his work was done,
the dragons were no more.</i>

02:56.543 --> 02:58.779
<i>And so the Knight rode on,</i>

02:58.846 --> 03:01.782
<i>into legend, into lore."</i>

03:02.817 --> 03:04.417
<i>And that's it for tonight, kid.</i>

03:04.484 --> 03:06.519
More. Please?

03:06.586 --> 03:08.388
<i>I've gotta go, buddy,</i>

03:08.455 --> 03:10.157
<i>and you've gotta get to sleep.</i>

03:10.224 --> 03:11.092
Okay.

03:14.061 --> 03:15.096
He misses you.

03:15.997 --> 03:17.564
<i>We miss you.</i>

03:17.631 --> 03:19.499
I'll be on the last plane
out tonight.

03:21.135 --> 03:23.170
I love you, Adeline Wilson.

03:23.237 --> 03:26.107
And I adore you, Slade Wilson.

03:41.389 --> 03:42.857
Under the covers,
little soldier.

03:42.924 --> 03:44.591
Aye-aye, Captain.

03:45.927 --> 03:46.928
Read to me, Mama.

03:46.994 --> 03:49.163
- But Papa already read you...
- Please?

03:49.230 --> 03:53.100
Don't give me that wide-eyed
innocent routine, mister.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.502
Please, Mama?

03:56.938 --> 03:59.340
Not that one.
That's just for Papa.

03:59.407 --> 04:03.144
You are clearly the commanding
officer in this family.

05:17.418 --> 05:18.919
'Night, little soldier.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.255
Good night, Mama.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.598
No need to panic.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.666
You'd be dead already
if I wanted it.

05:33.734 --> 05:36.037
What do you want?

05:36.636 --> 05:37.838
Your son.

06:26.754 --> 06:28.322
If you were looking
for a helpless victim,

06:28.389 --> 06:30.524
you came to the wrong house.

06:45.473 --> 06:47.708
You're out of practice Adeline.

06:50.010 --> 06:52.746
From what I've heard,
you were something to behold,

06:52.813 --> 06:55.182
before marriage and motherhood
made you soft.

06:57.318 --> 07:00.620
Leader of an elite squad within
the Green Berets called Team Seven.

07:00.687 --> 07:03.224
You trained Slade Wilson.

07:03.290 --> 07:05.860
Helped make him the killing
machine that he is today.

07:05.926 --> 07:08.695
"Killing machine"?

07:08.762 --> 07:10.764
He's a businessman.

07:10.831 --> 07:12.665
Oh, Adeline,

07:12.733 --> 07:14.667
there's so much you don't know.

07:14.735 --> 07:16.737
Who the hell are you?

07:17.338 --> 07:18.405
The Jackal.

07:35.823 --> 07:37.858
Molina sent you.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.693
<i>El Presidente</i> doesn't
like his generals plotting against him.

07:40.761 --> 07:43.097
He finds
revolution distasteful.

07:43.164 --> 07:45.599
Then go ahead.
Cut my throat.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.068
You'll never
get out of here alive.

07:48.135 --> 07:49.436
Of course I will.

07:51.939 --> 07:53.307
What is this?

07:53.374 --> 07:54.775
The head of President Molina.

07:54.842 --> 07:57.011
Note the look of surprise
on his face.

07:57.077 --> 07:59.380
Very similar to
how you look right now.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.951
I don't understand.

08:04.018 --> 08:06.654
If Molina hired you
to assassinate me, then...

08:06.720 --> 08:08.688
I'm a mercenary,
not an idiot.

08:08.756 --> 08:10.958
Your president
was an oppressive fascist

08:11.025 --> 08:12.993
who ground his people
into the dirt.

08:13.060 --> 08:15.796
Under his rule,
San Miguel became a cesspool

08:15.863 --> 08:17.898
of poverty, hunger and disease,

08:17.965 --> 08:21.502
while he just grew richer
and fatter.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.170
Do better, General Suarez.

08:23.971 --> 08:25.272
Or this will be you.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.275
And, oh, yes,

08:28.342 --> 08:30.811
there is the little matter
of my fee.

08:40.054 --> 08:41.889
Which I am delighted to pay.

08:50.164 --> 08:52.199
<i>Took a few hits, I see.</i>

08:52.266 --> 08:54.034
It's nothing.

08:54.101 --> 08:56.370
<i>Do you ever consider what would
happen to Adeline and Joseph</i>

08:56.437 --> 08:59.373
<i>if you died on
one of these little jaunts?</i>

08:59.440 --> 09:02.376
<i>You've been doing this for
what, eight years now? Nine?</i>

09:02.443 --> 09:05.879
<i>Maybe it's time to stop being
a mercenary and start being...</i>

09:05.946 --> 09:08.249
I'll need transport
ASAP, Wintergreen.

09:08.315 --> 09:10.284
<i>And you will have it,
old friend.</i>

09:13.754 --> 09:16.957
<i>The older I get,
the more I envy your ability to heal.</i>

09:17.024 --> 09:19.793
<i>The Army certainly got
what they paid for.</i>

09:19.860 --> 09:21.262
And more.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.845
It's not working, dammit!

09:43.150 --> 09:45.653
- Will he live?
- Doesn't matter.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.121
We've failed again.

09:53.560 --> 09:54.962
They said...

09:55.029 --> 09:56.630
They said it was a miracle
I'm still alive.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.301
I told you not to volunteer
for that damn drug trial.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.469
When they wouldn't even tell you
what it was for, I knew that...

10:02.536 --> 10:03.971
It was my choice.

10:04.038 --> 10:05.372
I could have said no.

10:05.439 --> 10:06.840
Then why didn't you?

10:06.907 --> 10:08.743
Because they needed me.

10:08.809 --> 10:11.178
There were only a handful of
men that fit the profile...

10:11.245 --> 10:13.580
And you've always been
a good soldier.

10:14.515 --> 10:16.083
Maybe too good.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.118
They'll be sending me home
in a few days.

10:18.185 --> 10:19.687
And I'm going with you.

10:19.754 --> 10:21.155
But your duties...

10:21.221 --> 10:23.190
I've served my country.

10:23.257 --> 10:25.025
And done a damn good job of it.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.561
- But you need me now...
- No.

10:27.628 --> 10:29.296
You've got another 14 months.

10:29.363 --> 10:31.465
You do what you
signed on to do.

10:33.735 --> 10:37.137
Let me try to build
a life for myself, for us.

10:37.671 --> 10:39.206
Then...

10:39.273 --> 10:40.742
Then, if you still want me...

10:40.809 --> 10:43.077
Why wouldn't I want you?

10:43.143 --> 10:44.713
I love you, Slade.

10:44.779 --> 10:46.413
We've got plans.

10:46.480 --> 10:48.115
A whole life ahead of us.

10:48.182 --> 10:51.018
The Army's the only life
I've ever known, Addie.

10:51.085 --> 10:54.221
Being that good soldier.
Following orders.

10:55.456 --> 10:57.157
Killing the enemy.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.393
There's more to you than that.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.162
I hope so.

14:02.576 --> 14:04.378
Addie?

14:20.929 --> 14:22.931
Dear God, what happened?

14:22.997 --> 14:24.398
Where's Joseph?

14:24.464 --> 14:27.735
He said if I called the police,
he'd kill him.

14:28.402 --> 14:30.571
Who? Who did this?

14:31.338 --> 14:33.741
Said it's you he wants.

14:33.808 --> 14:34.809
Who did this?

14:35.977 --> 14:37.377
The Jackal.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.646
Who the hell is the Jackal?

14:39.714 --> 14:41.348
You know who he is!

14:41.415 --> 14:43.584
"I haven't lied to you since,"
you said,

14:43.650 --> 14:46.453
"and I will never
lie to you again."

14:46.520 --> 14:49.523
But it's all been
nothing but lies, hasn't it?

14:49.590 --> 14:50.925
I don't know
what you're talking about.

14:50.992 --> 14:52.492
Stop!

14:52.559 --> 14:55.395
The Jackal told me everything.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.398
The Army thought
the experiment was a failure,

14:58.465 --> 15:00.267
that their drug didn't work.

15:00.334 --> 15:02.436
That's why they discharged you.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.205
But it just took a little time
to turn you into...

15:05.272 --> 15:07.008
What did he call you?

15:07.075 --> 15:08.275
Deathstroke.

15:09.343 --> 15:11.378
I'm a businessman.

15:11.445 --> 15:14.147
That's what
I always believed.

15:14.214 --> 15:17.317
Slade Wilson, a good
and decent man,

15:17.384 --> 15:19.219
who loved his wife and son,

15:19.286 --> 15:21.421
who'd do anything
for his family.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.791
But you're a goddamn mercenary.

15:23.858 --> 15:26.961
Selling death
to the highest bidder,

15:27.028 --> 15:28.796
and you hid it from me.

15:29.964 --> 15:31.331
All these years.

15:32.734 --> 15:33.634
Why?

15:38.338 --> 15:40.074
I'll bring Joseph back.

15:40.140 --> 15:43.377
And I'll bring the Jackal's
carcass back with me.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.480
I don't need you.
We don't need you.

15:46.546 --> 15:48.082
I can do this without you.

15:50.684 --> 15:52.252
Broken, damn it.

15:52.319 --> 15:54.187
In several places,
from the look of it.

15:54.588 --> 15:55.455
Go.

16:02.329 --> 16:04.431
When this is over, Addie,
we'll talk.

16:04.498 --> 16:06.466
Don't even try
to lie to me again,

16:06.533 --> 16:09.236
you manipulative
son of a bitch.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.405
Just bring Joseph home.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.808
And God help you if you fail.

16:15.143 --> 16:16.510
I never fail.

16:37.297 --> 16:39.599
How's the wife,
Wilson?

16:39.666 --> 16:40.868
Show yourself.

16:46.741 --> 16:47.909
I'm right here.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.610
My son...

16:50.677 --> 16:53.480
Is fine.
Just a bargaining chip.

16:53.547 --> 16:56.316
Accept the bargain
and he doesn't get hurt.

16:56.383 --> 16:58.351
I won't work with H.I.V.E.

16:58.418 --> 17:00.520
So you said
the last time I asked.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.889
And I respect that.

17:01.956 --> 17:04.925
Unfortunately,
my superiors don't.

17:08.963 --> 17:12.200
They think your skills
would be of great value to us.

17:12.265 --> 17:13.567
You're terrorists.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.837
Equal opportunity murderers.

17:15.903 --> 17:18.305
Selling our services
to the highest bidder,

17:18.371 --> 17:19.741
just like you.

17:19.807 --> 17:22.342
Only difference is
you're small-time.

17:22.409 --> 17:24.444
H.I.V.E. thinks globally.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.780
How many innocent people,

17:25.847 --> 17:29.183
women and children
have died at your hands?

17:29.249 --> 17:31.886
Honestly,
I've lost count.

17:31.953 --> 17:36.157
But we're all murderers
under the skin, Wilson.

17:36.224 --> 17:38.159
It's just a matter of scale.

17:38.226 --> 17:41.863
Morality is delusion that fools
wear like a comforting cloak.

17:42.897 --> 17:45.332
But you're no fool.
Are you?

17:45.398 --> 17:48.136
A monster perhaps,
but not a fool.

17:48.202 --> 17:49.503
Monster?

17:49.569 --> 17:52.073
Yes, I kill for a living.

17:52.140 --> 17:54.108
But only if the cause is right.

17:54.175 --> 17:56.077
There are lines I won't cross.

17:56.144 --> 17:58.012
I don't know
if the widows and children

17:58.079 --> 18:01.481
of those soldiers you murdered
in San Miguel would agree.

18:02.183 --> 18:03.450
We're the same.

18:03.517 --> 18:04.919
Can't you see that?

18:04.986 --> 18:08.388
Men like us pretend
to have hearts and souls.

18:08.455 --> 18:09.623
But underneath that,

18:10.323 --> 18:11.491
only darkness.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.462
I...

18:19.033 --> 18:21.702
The answer is no.

18:23.137 --> 18:24.437
Reconsider.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.537
Enough!

19:01.474 --> 19:02.710
Enough.

19:28.202 --> 19:31.072
You do realize
that you've proven my point.

19:31.138 --> 19:34.541
She was
an extraordinary operative.

19:35.776 --> 19:37.945
But clearly
not extraordinary enough.

19:38.012 --> 19:41.148
Bronze Tiger's skills are legendary.

19:41.916 --> 19:43.084
And look at him.

19:45.518 --> 19:47.955
Give me my boy.

19:48.022 --> 19:50.523
Give me your answer.

19:50.590 --> 19:51.926
Will you join H.I.V.E.?

20:00.634 --> 20:03.037
Or will my man slit little
Joseph's throat here and now?

20:13.446 --> 20:15.816
Joseph, don't be afraid.

20:39.874 --> 20:40.775
Joe.

20:41.608 --> 20:42.743
Joseph!

20:44.078 --> 20:45.112
You're not gonna die.

20:45.179 --> 20:46.714
I swear to God
you're not gonna die.

21:39.599 --> 21:40.935
<i>Dear Joseph,</i>

21:44.671 --> 21:47.875
<i>your mother thinks it's best
that I stay away for a while.</i>

21:48.776 --> 21:49.944
<i>And I agree.</i>

22:00.988 --> 22:03.190
<i>You see, I have a secret,</i>

22:03.257 --> 22:06.460
<i>one I've never shared
with you before.</i>

22:06.526 --> 22:09.764
<i>I'm a knight, like the ones
in our favorite book,</i>

22:09.830 --> 22:11.932
<i>roaming a dangerous world.</i>

22:11.999 --> 22:15.102
<i>Righting wrongs,
slaying dragons.</i>

22:18.205 --> 22:22.076
<i>And I don't want those dragons
to hurt you, or your mom...</i>

22:23.077 --> 22:24.078
<i>ever again.</i>

23:11.559 --> 23:13.693
That was a mistake.

24:06.847 --> 24:08.349
Who sent you?

24:09.483 --> 24:10.417
Does it matter?

24:12.086 --> 24:13.354
I was paid a small fortune

24:13.420 --> 24:15.688
to liberate what's
hidden away downstairs.

24:16.590 --> 24:17.858
But frankly, Bora...

24:24.231 --> 24:26.934
...I would have done this one
for free.

24:59.533 --> 25:00.901
It's all right.

25:00.968 --> 25:03.804
No one's gonna hurt you
ever again.

26:07.034 --> 26:09.738
<i>Hello, Wilson.</i>

26:09.803 --> 26:12.406
<i>Or do you prefer "Deathstroke"?</i>

26:12.473 --> 26:13.407
Who the hell...

26:15.576 --> 26:18.012
<i>You can call me
the H.I.V.E. Queen.</i>

26:18.612 --> 26:19.813
H.I.V.E. is gone.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.750
I spent years
making sure of that.

26:21.815 --> 26:24.785
<i>No, not gone, underground.</i>

26:25.886 --> 26:27.621
<i>Regrouping.</i>

26:27.688 --> 26:30.924
<i>Dozens of independent cells
scattered across the world.</i>

26:30.991 --> 26:35.963
<i>And my little cell is very
interested in the Wilson family.</i>

26:36.030 --> 26:38.132
I turned H.I.V.E. down
ten years ago.

26:38.198 --> 26:40.100
- And if you think...
- <i>Don't flatter yourself.</i>

26:40.167 --> 26:42.803
<i>You made it clear then
that you were a bad fit.</i>

26:42.870 --> 26:46.407
<i>And really, why bother
with the father</i>

26:46.473 --> 26:48.475
<i>when I have the son?</i>

26:48.542 --> 26:49.410
What?

26:50.844 --> 26:52.212
Joseph?

26:52.279 --> 26:54.214
<i>You're a
handgun, Slade.</i>

26:55.649 --> 26:59.086
<i>Your boy, he's a nuclear bomb.</i>

26:59.153 --> 27:01.723
<i>A bomb that belongs to me now.</i>

27:01.790 --> 27:03.290
What have you done to him?

27:06.527 --> 27:09.229
<i>Me? Don't you know?</i>

27:09.897 --> 27:11.432
<i>You did this.</i>

27:13.834 --> 27:15.469
<i>You didn't know.</i>

27:16.771 --> 27:18.238
<i>More's the pity.</i>

27:49.570 --> 27:52.774
I chose that school in
Switzerland for the security.

27:52.841 --> 27:54.208
You chose poorly.

27:55.943 --> 27:57.746
Did you know?

27:57.812 --> 28:00.180
That whatever the Army did to
alter your biology, your genetics,

28:00.247 --> 28:01.682
was passed on to Joseph?

28:01.750 --> 28:02.851
Of course not.

28:02.916 --> 28:04.418
From what
that H.I.V.E. Queen said,

28:04.485 --> 28:06.453
his abilities are
very different than mine.

28:06.520 --> 28:08.989
Not physical in nature,
psychic.

28:09.923 --> 28:11.258
What?

28:11.325 --> 28:12.960
There were times when I'd...

28:14.495 --> 28:15.929
feel him.

28:15.996 --> 28:17.464
As if he was
in the room with me.

28:17.531 --> 28:20.167
But I thought
I was just imagining it.

28:20.234 --> 28:21.502
He should have been with you.

28:21.568 --> 28:23.036
How could you just
send him away like that?

28:23.103 --> 28:25.205
I did it to keep him safe.

28:25.272 --> 28:26.841
I could have
kept him safe.

28:26.907 --> 28:28.409
The way you did
last time?

28:28.475 --> 28:31.311
When that animal cut his
throat and left him mute?

28:31.378 --> 28:33.815
You punished me enough
for it, didn't you?

28:33.882 --> 28:35.315
Locked me out of his life.

28:38.051 --> 28:39.920
And you never
once questioned it.

28:39.987 --> 28:41.488
Never once tried to see him.

28:41.555 --> 28:44.024
Another man would have
fought me tooth and nail,

28:44.091 --> 28:46.093
would have begged
to see his son.

28:46.160 --> 28:48.662
But you? One pathetic letter,

28:48.730 --> 28:50.964
and then you were gone forever.

28:51.031 --> 28:52.366
Why?

28:52.433 --> 28:55.169
I always seem to be
asking you that. Why?

28:55.235 --> 28:56.805
The past is dead, Addie,

28:56.871 --> 28:59.239
and nothing we do,
nothing we say, can change it.

28:59.306 --> 29:01.375
But the past isn't dead, Slade.

29:01.442 --> 29:04.244
It's happening all over again.

29:04.311 --> 29:05.847
So what are we
going to do about it?

29:05.914 --> 29:07.181
"We"?

29:07.247 --> 29:09.483
You're not going after him
alone this time.

29:09.550 --> 29:11.351
I'm going with you.

29:11.418 --> 29:13.420
Do you remember
what the Jackal did to you?

29:13.487 --> 29:14.488
Oh, I remember.

29:14.555 --> 29:17.558
He broke me.
Humiliated me.

29:17.624 --> 29:19.293
And it was my own fault.

29:19.359 --> 29:21.830
I put so much energy
into being a mother,

29:21.896 --> 29:23.197
being your wife,

29:23.263 --> 29:25.065
that I lost my center.

29:25.132 --> 29:26.567
Well, I've found it again.

29:28.502 --> 29:30.437
You haven't been
on a combat mission in years.

29:36.878 --> 29:38.979
Guess I'm just too rusty, huh?

29:42.717 --> 29:44.618
Stay out of it, Adeline.

29:44.685 --> 29:46.253
Slade. Slade.

29:51.726 --> 29:52.593
Good luck.

31:15.342 --> 31:17.678
It's a beautiful home,
Colonel Kapoor,

31:25.118 --> 31:27.621
Built with H.I.V.E. money,
as I recall.

31:27.688 --> 31:32.559
I stopped working for them years
ago, as you no doubt also recall.

31:33.360 --> 31:35.095
You had no choice.

31:35.162 --> 31:36.430
I destroyed them.

31:37.065 --> 31:38.632
Or so I thought.

31:38.699 --> 31:40.500
They're back?

31:40.567 --> 31:42.804
<i>And I want information
about one cell in particular,</i>

31:42.870 --> 31:45.439
<i>led by a woman who calls
herself the H.I.V.E. Queen.</i>

31:45.505 --> 31:48.342
<i>I closed the door
on that chapter of my life.</i>

31:48.408 --> 31:51.079
<i>I've spoken to
close to a dozen former operatives</i>

31:51.144 --> 31:52.847
<i>who all claim the same thing.</i>

31:53.513 --> 31:54.481
And?

31:54.548 --> 31:56.316
Telling the truth,
as far as I know.

31:56.718 --> 31:57.919
And?

31:57.986 --> 31:59.887
Don't worry, Colonel,
I left them all intact.

31:59.954 --> 32:01.889
Aside from Myshkin.

32:01.956 --> 32:04.759
He was so afraid to even talk about
H.I.V.E. that he killed himself.

32:04.826 --> 32:07.694
I was never in very deep,
Deathstroke, you know that.

32:07.762 --> 32:11.131
As a colonel I could
provide a favor here and there.

32:11.198 --> 32:13.101
For which you were
richly rewarded.

32:13.166 --> 32:16.838
And the truth is,
I was relieved when you took them down.

32:17.972 --> 32:20.842
I have a wife now. A family.

32:20.908 --> 32:24.078
A little graft is one thing, but
getting involved with H.I.V.E. again...

32:24.144 --> 32:25.212
No.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.886
If you hear anything,

32:31.953 --> 32:34.122
you contact me immediately.

32:34.221 --> 32:35.322
I will.

32:59.781 --> 33:01.682
<i>This better
be good, Kapoor.</i>

33:44.926 --> 33:45.827
Impressive.

33:47.028 --> 33:48.595
This is a surprise.

33:56.603 --> 33:58.005
Look at you.

33:58.072 --> 34:00.640
Hero of the Kaznian revolution.

34:01.441 --> 34:03.111
You know how it goes.

34:03.177 --> 34:05.412
Southern Kaznians
take the capital.

34:05.479 --> 34:07.982
A few years go by,
and then the north takes it.

34:08.049 --> 34:09.649
Been going on for years.

34:09.717 --> 34:12.485
I've worked for both sides.
They're very generous.

34:12.552 --> 34:15.688
And children starve.
Innocents die.

34:15.757 --> 34:18.592
Still singing the same song,
huh, Wilson?

34:18.658 --> 34:20.694
The mercenary
with a conscience.

34:20.762 --> 34:22.395
The rest of us...

34:22.462 --> 34:23.831
we're beneath you!

34:29.335 --> 34:32.339
I didn't come here
to debate, Tiger.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.440
Or to fight.

34:34.507 --> 34:37.277
I came here for information.

34:37.344 --> 34:39.279
If it's dope on H.I.V.E.
you want...

34:51.690 --> 34:53.426
You have nothing
to do with them.

34:53.493 --> 34:55.328
Didn't even know
they still existed.

35:03.436 --> 35:05.338
Oh, I knew.

35:05.405 --> 35:07.074
Once the Jackal took over.

35:09.143 --> 35:10.912
Jackal? He's alive?

35:14.381 --> 35:16.550
You should've made sure
he was dead.

35:19.053 --> 35:22.455
That man has
a serious hate on for you.

35:26.260 --> 35:28.129
After that mess with your kid,

35:28.196 --> 35:31.331
Jackal decided that H.I.V.E.
needed reorganization.

35:31.398 --> 35:34.434
New leadership.
So he stepped back.

35:34.501 --> 35:37.537
And let
me wipe out his competition.

35:42.409 --> 35:46.013
And then, very quietly,
put the pieces back together.

36:07.768 --> 36:09.937
But I was tired
of taking orders.

36:10.004 --> 36:11.404
Decided to freelance.

36:13.406 --> 36:15.109
Worked out pretty well.

36:29.323 --> 36:30.624
Again?

36:30.690 --> 36:32.293
Son of a bitch.

36:32.360 --> 36:34.328
You did it again.

36:34.394 --> 36:36.764
Where can I find
the H.I.V.E Queen?

36:51.411 --> 36:52.679
Fine.

36:52.747 --> 36:54.414
The Kerguelen Islands.

36:55.349 --> 36:56.516
Thank you.

36:58.352 --> 36:59.686
That's my ride.

37:12.233 --> 37:13.500
Don't bother.

37:13.566 --> 37:16.170
Where he's headed,
there's no coming back.

37:19.539 --> 37:20.775
Oh, shit.

37:33.087 --> 37:36.690
So, how the hell did you get your
hands on an aircraft like this?

37:36.757 --> 37:38.192
Somebody owed me a favor.

37:38.259 --> 37:40.061
A very big one, apparently.

37:41.695 --> 37:43.397
There's every chance
they know you're coming.

37:43.463 --> 37:44.664
I'm counting on it.

37:44.732 --> 37:46.466
You'll never change.

37:46.533 --> 37:48.336
Having second thoughts,
Wintergreen?

37:48.402 --> 37:49.536
On the contrary.

37:49.602 --> 37:51.638
Since MI6 retired me,

37:51.706 --> 37:56.110
the only fun I ever have is when you
invite me along on these little jaunts.

37:56.177 --> 37:57.945
I'll be too old for this
soon enough.

37:58.012 --> 38:00.815
Well, I'm probably
too old for it now,

38:00.881 --> 38:03.117
but I'm not ready
for the nursing home just yet.

38:03.184 --> 38:04.719
This one's no jaunt.

38:04.785 --> 38:06.454
Joseph's life is at stake.

38:06.519 --> 38:08.055
And what kind of
godfather would I be

38:08.122 --> 38:10.391
if I wasn't helping you
bring him home?

38:10.458 --> 38:11.826
In fact, I...

38:12.492 --> 38:14.395
There they are.

38:14.462 --> 38:18.933
The Kerguelens. Also known as
the Desolation Islands.

38:19.666 --> 38:21.102
Aptly named, I think.

38:29.043 --> 38:30.711
<i>Best of luck, Slade.</i>

38:30.778 --> 38:32.813
I don't believe in luck.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.216
But in this case, I'll take it.

39:54.661 --> 39:56.363
I was expecting an army.

39:57.597 --> 39:59.166
They don't need an army.

40:00.534 --> 40:02.236
They've got me.

40:02.303 --> 40:06.040
Sandra Wu San.
Also known as Lady Shiva.

40:06.107 --> 40:07.908
There are people
who consider you

40:07.975 --> 40:10.711
the deadliest hand-to-hand
combatant in the world.

40:10.778 --> 40:12.279
And they would be right.

40:18.319 --> 40:19.753
What are you doing?

40:19.820 --> 40:21.122
Surrendering.

40:21.188 --> 40:23.623
I do not accept your surrender.

40:23.690 --> 40:25.192
<i>Not tonight, Shiva.</i>

40:25.259 --> 40:26.494
<i>I want him alive.</i>

40:26.560 --> 40:27.761
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

40:29.263 --> 40:30.831
Yes, my Queen.

40:31.432 --> 40:32.299
Up.

40:50.650 --> 40:53.287
Surrender
is a clever strategy.

40:53.354 --> 40:56.390
Easier than fighting
your way into the fortress.

40:56.457 --> 40:58.959
But it won't be
quite as easy getting out.

41:01.661 --> 41:02.863
What?

41:02.930 --> 41:04.431
You're just a child.

41:13.007 --> 41:16.110
And you're a dinosaur
whose time has passed.

41:20.848 --> 41:22.750
Let's cut the bullshit,
shall we?

41:22.816 --> 41:25.319
Where's my boy? Where's Joseph.

41:26.187 --> 41:28.923
Yes. Let's cut the bullshit.

41:33.260 --> 41:34.595
Where is he?

41:34.662 --> 41:36.197
Such concern.

41:36.263 --> 41:39.800
And yet, you abandoned Joseph
without a second thought

41:39.867 --> 41:41.569
just as his mother did.

41:41.635 --> 41:45.739
Left him trapped, isolated,
friendless in that school.

41:45.806 --> 41:49.276
His mind, his very soul,
on fire.

41:49.343 --> 41:50.778
I didn't know.

41:50.844 --> 41:51.979
Could it be...

41:53.814 --> 41:55.282
you didn't want to?

41:57.184 --> 42:00.621
So, he's what,
your little lab rat?

42:00.688 --> 42:02.456
We're going
to train him.

42:02.523 --> 42:04.892
Help him master his powers.

42:04.959 --> 42:07.094
You've got him
locked in a damn cage.

42:07.161 --> 42:08.896
For his own protection.

42:08.963 --> 42:12.733
His psychic energies
are still wildly unstable.

42:12.800 --> 42:14.101
But his potential,

42:14.635 --> 42:15.769
limitless.

42:15.836 --> 42:18.472
- As a weapon.
- Yes.

42:19.206 --> 42:20.641
Think of it.

42:20.709 --> 42:24.178
Manipulation on a global scale
through the power of the mind.

42:24.245 --> 42:27.047
Domination of the planet
with no bullets.

42:27.114 --> 42:28.182
No bombs.

42:28.249 --> 42:31.885
What country on Earth
could resist us?

42:35.956 --> 42:37.391
Joseph? Joseph!

42:38.792 --> 42:39.893
Joseph!

42:39.960 --> 42:41.028
Don't be afraid.

42:45.165 --> 42:46.033
Joe...

42:48.435 --> 42:51.205
"Joseph" was the name
you gave him.

42:52.072 --> 42:53.807
But I've given him a new name.

42:53.874 --> 42:55.242
A better name.

42:55.744 --> 42:57.044
Jericho.

42:57.111 --> 42:58.779
Because, with my help,

42:58.846 --> 43:03.150
he's going to bring the walls
of the old order tumbling down.

43:07.855 --> 43:09.390
Be honest, Wilson.

43:09.456 --> 43:11.358
You don't really
care about him.

43:11.925 --> 43:13.160
You never did.

43:13.227 --> 43:15.329
This is just another
adventure to you.

43:15.396 --> 43:18.565
Another chance to prove
your questionable manhood.

43:19.199 --> 43:20.167
But here,

43:21.035 --> 43:24.071
he'll find a home, a family.

43:27.608 --> 43:29.543
<i>Help me, Papa.</i>

43:29.610 --> 43:31.312
<i>Get me out of here!</i>

43:31.378 --> 43:32.246
<i>Please!</i>

43:33.614 --> 43:34.882
Get back, buddy.

43:38.652 --> 43:39.920
No!

44:37.678 --> 44:39.714
<i>I can help.
Put me down.</i>

44:39.781 --> 44:41.515
- You're weak.
- <i>I'm all right.</i>

44:48.322 --> 44:49.256
Joe.

44:50.891 --> 44:52.259
<i>I know a way out.</i>

44:55.195 --> 44:56.765
<i>This will get us
to the surface.</i>

44:56.831 --> 44:58.733
<i>But I don't know what to do
once we're up there.</i>

44:58.800 --> 45:00.100
I've got that covered.

45:00.167 --> 45:01.935
Wintergreen, it's time.

45:02.002 --> 45:03.370
<i>On my way, Slade.</i>

45:12.312 --> 45:13.647
<i>That's all...</i>

45:13.715 --> 45:15.015
<i>That's all I can...</i>

45:17.117 --> 45:18.519
Wintergreen.

45:18.585 --> 45:21.054
Wintergreen?

45:21.121 --> 45:23.223
<i>Uncle William's not coming.</i>

45:23.290 --> 45:24.658
What?

45:24.726 --> 45:26.326
<i>I blocked the signal.</i>

45:26.393 --> 45:27.361
But I heard him.

45:27.428 --> 45:29.596
You heard
what I wanted you to hear.

45:30.397 --> 45:32.199
Joseph, why?

45:32.266 --> 45:35.269
Did you really think
I would betray my own sister?

45:35.870 --> 45:36.937
Sister?

45:45.179 --> 45:47.916
The H.I.V.E. Queen, she's...

45:47.981 --> 45:49.049
<i>Your daughter.</i>

45:51.118 --> 45:53.086
You really didn't know?

45:53.153 --> 45:55.222
Joseph, listen to me.
I came here...

45:55.289 --> 45:58.392
<i>Ride to the rescue
like a knight in shining armor?</i>

46:00.527 --> 46:02.196
Joseph. Joseph!

46:02.864 --> 46:04.131
<i>My name</i>

46:04.732 --> 46:05.733
<i>is Jericho!</i>

46:09.838 --> 46:11.605
<i>Joseph's gone.</i>

46:11.672 --> 46:12.539
Joseph!

46:18.412 --> 46:21.114
<i>Good-bye, Deathstroke.</i>

46:45.105 --> 46:47.641
Joseph.

46:58.753 --> 47:01.088
Well done, boy. Well done.

47:16.738 --> 47:17.739
<i>Dark.</i>

47:19.573 --> 47:20.607
<i>Stillness.</i>

47:21.910 --> 47:22.777
<i>Peace.</i>

47:23.978 --> 47:25.078
<i>Oblivion.</i>

47:27.548 --> 47:31.385
<i>Is it such a terrible thing
to embrace the void,</i>

47:32.820 --> 47:34.722
<i>surrender to the silence,</i>

47:35.757 --> 47:36.657
<i>die?</i>

47:39.293 --> 47:41.328
<i>But I can't die now.</i>

47:41.395 --> 47:43.630
<i>One day, maybe soon.</i>

47:44.598 --> 47:46.366
<i>But not yet.</i>

47:48.235 --> 47:50.604
<i>Joseph needs me.</i>

47:50.671 --> 47:51.739
<i>My son needs me.</i>

47:53.106 --> 47:54.174
<i>And I...</i>

47:55.475 --> 47:56.376
<i>have...</i>

47:57.177 --> 47:58.645
<i>to live!</i>

48:05.085 --> 48:06.854
Easy. Easy.

48:06.921 --> 48:09.489
How am I even alive?

48:10.357 --> 48:12.060
You almost weren't.

48:12.125 --> 48:14.494
If I hadn't
fished you out in time...

48:14.561 --> 48:16.030
Addie?

48:16.096 --> 48:19.867
You may have an incredible
ability to heal, Slade.

48:19.934 --> 48:21.435
But you're not immortal.

48:26.406 --> 48:29.142
And one of these days,
you won't be coming back.

48:32.814 --> 48:35.482
Told you I wasn't gonna
let you do this alone.

48:36.249 --> 48:37.719
Where are we?

48:37.785 --> 48:38.853
On a boat.

48:38.920 --> 48:41.789
Far enough away
from that damn island.

48:41.856 --> 48:43.256
How did...

48:43.323 --> 48:44.658
How did you find me?

48:44.726 --> 48:46.894
I've been on you
the whole time.

48:46.961 --> 48:49.764
Used a nano-tracker that I
procured from an old friend.

48:49.831 --> 48:53.266
Tiny GPS device that lodged
into your intestinal tract.

48:54.434 --> 48:57.270
- But how did...
- Sealed with a kiss.

49:03.176 --> 49:05.646
You implanted it
with your tongue?

49:07.715 --> 49:10.350
And here I thought
I'd won your heart again.

49:10.417 --> 49:11.853
It's got a limited shelf life.

49:11.919 --> 49:14.154
Should dissolve
in another few days.

49:14.789 --> 49:16.289
Drink this.

49:16.356 --> 49:19.626
A mix of herbs that should help
speed up your natural healing.

49:19.693 --> 49:20.360
Ugh.

49:20.427 --> 49:22.429
Drink it, tough guy.

49:28.235 --> 49:29.336
Ah...

49:29.837 --> 49:31.105
Wait.

49:31.171 --> 49:33.573
You said you got your tracker
from an old friend.

49:34.641 --> 49:36.343
Wintergreen.

49:36.410 --> 49:37.879
You two have been conspiring?

49:37.945 --> 49:39.212
Not conspiring,

49:39.279 --> 49:42.884
just sharing information
and resources.

49:42.950 --> 49:44.418
When I see that old man...

49:44.484 --> 49:47.421
If you're going to be angry
at someone, try yourself.

49:47.487 --> 49:50.357
You've made some terrible
choices in your life, Slade.

49:50.424 --> 49:52.160
And the people you love,

49:52.225 --> 49:54.361
that you claim to love,

49:54.428 --> 49:56.396
have paid a terrible price.

50:02.003 --> 50:03.771
So he's dead?

50:03.838 --> 50:06.473
The sharks have made
a meal of him by now.

50:06.540 --> 50:09.476
You must feel a profound sense
of satisfaction, Rose.

50:10.111 --> 50:11.913
I wish I did.

50:11.979 --> 50:15.615
I've wanted this for so long,
but now that I have it...

50:15.682 --> 50:18.753
Let it go, child.
You've done well.

50:18.820 --> 50:20.054
Made me proud.

50:20.121 --> 50:21.989
Now let's move on
with our plans.

50:22.924 --> 50:24.424
We need more time.

50:24.491 --> 50:25.893
Jericho is not ready.

50:25.960 --> 50:28.996
You'll make sure he's ready,
won't you?

50:29.063 --> 50:30.732
- But...
- Won't you?

50:31.698 --> 50:32.900
Yes.

50:32.967 --> 50:34.301
I have faith in you, Rose.

50:34.367 --> 50:36.536
I've always had faith in you.

50:36.603 --> 50:38.538
Since the day we met

50:38.605 --> 50:42.210
and I rescued you
from a hellish existence.

50:42.275 --> 50:44.244
It wasn't all hell.

50:46.147 --> 50:47.280
<i>My mother,</i>

50:47.347 --> 50:49.016
<i>she loved me.</i>

50:49.083 --> 50:51.185
<i>Yes, she did.</i>

50:51.251 --> 50:53.121
<i>After Wilson abandoned her.</i>

50:53.187 --> 50:54.889
<i>left her pregnant and alone,</i>

50:54.956 --> 50:58.325
<i>she sacrificed everything
to build a good life for you.</i>

51:03.931 --> 51:05.767
<i>And perhaps,
it would have been good...</i>

51:09.436 --> 51:10.805
<i>...had she lived.</i>

51:14.374 --> 51:15.977
<i>And you were left alone.</i>

51:17.178 --> 51:18.813
<i>And Wilson,</i>

51:18.880 --> 51:21.314
<i>did he ever look back
and wonder?</i>

51:21.381 --> 51:22.850
<i>If he'd bothered,</i>

51:22.917 --> 51:25.352
<i>he might have discovered
that he had a daughter</i>

51:25.418 --> 51:27.621
<i>living on the streets
of Phnom Penh.</i>

51:29.991 --> 51:32.927
<i>But your father
did leave you one legacy.</i>

51:32.994 --> 51:35.797
<i>He passed his altered genetics
on to you</i>

51:37.965 --> 51:39.233
<i>Speed,</i>

51:39.299 --> 51:40.500
<i>stamina,</i>

51:41.434 --> 51:42.536
<i>heightened strength...</i>

51:44.604 --> 51:45.740
<i>What a gift.</i>

51:46.707 --> 51:48.441
<i>It was a curse.</i>

51:53.714 --> 51:55.716
<i>I suppose it was
at first.</i>

51:58.186 --> 51:59.053
<i>But then...</i>

52:02.089 --> 52:03.523
<i>I found you.</i>

52:04.926 --> 52:07.460
Took you under my wing,
trained you,

52:07.527 --> 52:09.362
became the father
you never had.

52:09.429 --> 52:11.698
Made you a queen.

52:11.766 --> 52:14.434
And now, you'll make
your brother a king.

52:14.501 --> 52:15.502
And together...

52:15.569 --> 52:17.537
We'll rule the world?

52:17.604 --> 52:20.507
No. We'll rule the rulers.

52:20.574 --> 52:22.642
So much better that way.

52:22.710 --> 52:25.313
Project Jericho launches
in ten days, Rose.

52:25.378 --> 52:28.850
I have my final preparations
to see to and you have yours.

52:29.382 --> 52:30.483
Be ready.

52:31.384 --> 52:33.154
Will I see you then?

52:33.221 --> 52:35.056
It's been more than a year.

52:35.122 --> 52:37.191
You know I have to
remain in seclusion.

52:37.258 --> 52:39.359
No one can know
where the H.I.V.E. Lord is.

52:39.426 --> 52:40.862
Not even you.

52:40.928 --> 52:42.596
But this, child,

52:42.662 --> 52:44.598
I wouldn't miss for the world.

52:51.005 --> 52:51.973
<i>You okay?</i>

52:55.343 --> 52:56.643
I am now.

53:02.216 --> 53:04.417
I didn't know
Lillian was pregnant.

53:04.484 --> 53:06.120
She never told me.

53:06.187 --> 53:08.455
- If I had known...
- You would've been the father to that girl

53:08.521 --> 53:09.991
that you were to Joseph?

53:11.225 --> 53:13.861
Years ago, when you told me
about Lillian,

53:13.928 --> 53:16.163
you said she didn't mean
anything to you.

53:17.664 --> 53:18.766
Was that true?

53:19.300 --> 53:20.467
She didn't.

53:20.533 --> 53:22.169
Not like you, Addie.

53:22.236 --> 53:23.503
But?

53:23.570 --> 53:26.473
After I realized
what had happened to me...

53:26.539 --> 53:28.843
what the army
had turned me into, I felt...

53:29.310 --> 53:30.177
lost.

53:30.945 --> 53:32.013
Untethered.

53:32.079 --> 53:34.215
I needed time
to sort through things.

53:34.282 --> 53:36.549
So, I travelled. Looking for...

53:36.616 --> 53:38.551
Something I couldn't give you?

53:38.618 --> 53:39.954
I don't know.

53:40.021 --> 53:42.422
Maybe it was easier
turning to a stranger.

53:42.489 --> 53:44.392
Lillian was a good woman.

53:44.457 --> 53:46.193
Sweet. Kind.

53:46.260 --> 53:47.728
So you did care about her.

53:47.795 --> 53:48.996
Yes. But not like...

53:49.063 --> 53:51.598
And just left her,
pregnant and alone.

53:51.665 --> 53:53.801
I didn't know about the child.

53:53.868 --> 53:55.703
Would you rather I'd stayed
with her and not...

53:55.770 --> 53:57.637
I'd rather
it had never happened.

53:57.705 --> 53:59.439
It sounds funny, I know.

53:59.506 --> 54:00.975
But my affair with Lillian,

54:01.042 --> 54:04.211
it's what made me realize
that you were the only one.

54:04.278 --> 54:05.246
That no other woman could...

54:05.313 --> 54:06.714
I'm not laughing.

54:06.781 --> 54:08.382
I didn't mean it like that.

54:08.448 --> 54:09.917
What did you mean?

54:09.984 --> 54:11.185
Addie, I...

54:17.892 --> 54:20.694
Doesn't matter now, does it?

54:21.195 --> 54:22.396
No.

54:22.462 --> 54:23.864
Not when you
destroyed our family,

54:23.931 --> 54:26.067
and another one
you didn't even know you had.

54:26.133 --> 54:28.601
That's your forte, isn't it?
Destruction.

54:28.668 --> 54:31.372
If you feel that way,
then why the hell are you helping me?

54:31.439 --> 54:33.107
I'm not helping you.

54:33.174 --> 54:34.474
I'm helping Joseph.

54:34.541 --> 54:36.077
And once this is done,

54:36.609 --> 54:37.812
so are we.

54:43.985 --> 54:46.653
<i>We did
the right thing, didn't we?</i>

54:47.388 --> 54:48.356
Yes.

54:48.422 --> 54:50.257
Of course, we did.

54:50.324 --> 54:52.259
He was a monster.

54:52.326 --> 54:54.295
He had to die.

54:54.362 --> 54:56.030
<i>He was a knight once.</i>

54:56.097 --> 54:57.331
What?

54:57.398 --> 54:58.598
<i>Nothing.</i>

55:00.134 --> 55:02.870
I know a part of you
still loves them.

55:03.503 --> 55:05.239
You can't help it.

55:05.306 --> 55:09.509
But Slade Wilson
never gave a damn about you.

55:09.576 --> 55:11.644
His entire life was a lie.

55:12.213 --> 55:13.646
And your mother,

55:13.714 --> 55:15.449
if she really loved you,

55:15.515 --> 55:18.651
would she have locked
you away in that school,

55:18.719 --> 55:20.254
left you there to rot?

55:21.956 --> 55:23.391
Would she?

55:23.457 --> 55:24.591
<i>No.</i>

55:39.407 --> 55:41.942
We were both so alone, Jericho.

55:42.009 --> 55:43.676
So alone.

55:43.744 --> 55:46.847
But we found each other,
didn't we?

55:49.283 --> 55:52.619
I guess we can thank
Deathstroke for that much.

55:52.685 --> 55:54.687
Years before we ever met,

55:54.755 --> 55:56.991
your mind reached out,

55:57.058 --> 55:58.092
found me.

55:58.159 --> 55:59.559
We knew each other,

55:59.626 --> 56:04.098
shared each other's thoughts,
feelings, all our hopes,

56:04.664 --> 56:06.067
all our sorrows.

56:06.767 --> 56:08.102
When this...

56:08.169 --> 56:11.405
this power inside me
came alive,

56:11.472 --> 56:13.640
I was so scared, Rose.

56:13.707 --> 56:16.177
I thought it was
going to burn me up,

56:16.243 --> 56:17.745
tear me apart.

56:17.812 --> 56:20.314
But then, I felt something.

56:20.381 --> 56:21.515
Like...

56:21.581 --> 56:23.851
Like the echo
of my own soul.

56:24.418 --> 56:25.286
Me.

56:26.554 --> 56:27.922
You.

56:27.988 --> 56:29.957
I think I would have died
without you.

56:31.792 --> 56:34.061
And I would have died
without you.

56:36.629 --> 56:38.631
You see, Jericho,

56:38.698 --> 56:41.135
you don't need
a mother or a father...

56:44.338 --> 56:45.806
when you have me.

56:49.810 --> 56:52.947
<i>And what about the man
who calls himself your father?</i>

56:53.013 --> 56:54.614
<i>What about the Jackal?</i>

57:01.789 --> 57:03.724
Wintergreen, you there?

57:05.092 --> 57:06.393
<i>Always.</i>

57:22.042 --> 57:23.744
Hey, what about the boat?

57:27.781 --> 57:29.150
I stole it, anyway.

57:43.264 --> 57:44.331
Bring them in.

57:51.705 --> 57:54.008
Thank you, agents,
for volunteering.

57:54.074 --> 57:55.910
But we didn't volun...

57:58.145 --> 58:00.781
Agent Sanchez, step forward.

58:05.920 --> 58:07.221
<i>On your knees.</i>

58:10.057 --> 58:10.925
Now her.

58:13.894 --> 58:15.129
<i>Your weapon.</i>

58:21.435 --> 58:23.671
This is nothing
compared to what's coming.

58:23.737 --> 58:27.775
And if you can't do this,
all our plans are for nothing.

58:28.475 --> 58:29.410
<i>All right.</i>

58:32.446 --> 58:33.914
<i>Shoot him.</i>

58:47.428 --> 58:48.295
<i>I can't.</i>

58:52.766 --> 58:54.368
Why'd you stop?

58:54.435 --> 58:55.769
<i>It worked, didn't it?</i>

58:55.836 --> 58:57.805
<i>She would've killed him
on my command.</i>

58:57.871 --> 58:59.907
<i>Why lose
a perfectly good agent?</i>

59:00.674 --> 59:02.142
Fine.

59:02.209 --> 59:05.045
Then let's have a show,
shall we?

59:28.703 --> 59:29.937
That's enough, Jericho.

59:39.380 --> 59:40.247
That's enough.

59:46.620 --> 59:47.521
Jericho, stop!

59:48.389 --> 59:49.256
Stop!

01:00:04.138 --> 01:00:05.572
<i>Oh, God! Oh, God!</i>

01:00:05.639 --> 01:00:07.975
<i>I'm sorry, Rose.
I don't know what happened!</i>

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:09.943
<i>I couldn't control it! I...</i>

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:12.246
Shh! It's my fault.

01:00:12.313 --> 01:00:15.316
I pushed you too far. Too fast.

01:00:15.382 --> 01:00:17.618
We'll go
a little slower tonight.

01:00:17.685 --> 01:00:20.954
<i>Tonight? But, can't we...</i>

01:00:21.021 --> 01:00:22.222
Tomorrow, then.

01:00:23.490 --> 01:00:25.092
And no more excuses.

01:00:31.999 --> 01:00:33.534
How did you get this?

01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:35.869
While you were blundering
into the H.I.V.E. Queen's trap,

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:39.340
I was hacking
into their servers.

01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:42.343
Jericho.
That's what she called Joseph.

01:01:09.336 --> 01:01:12.172
They're turning our son
into a weapon of war.

01:01:12.239 --> 01:01:15.442
Remember what she said?
I'm a handgun, but Joseph's...

01:01:15.509 --> 01:01:16.811
A nuclear bomb.

01:01:16.877 --> 01:01:18.713
But not in the way you think.

01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:22.784
Those exercises are to help him
master his abilities, focus them.

01:01:22.851 --> 01:01:23.951
But the goal?

01:01:24.952 --> 01:01:27.121
A revolution from within.

01:01:27.187 --> 01:01:29.323
Imagine if you
controlled someone

01:01:29.390 --> 01:01:31.191
who could control
the minds of others.

01:01:31.258 --> 01:01:35.830
Presidents, prime ministers,
despots, kings.

01:01:35.896 --> 01:01:37.732
Mind-theft on a global scale.

01:01:37.799 --> 01:01:41.402
You could reshape the planet
without firing a single shot.

01:01:41.468 --> 01:01:45.973
And we've got ten days to figure
out what their first move is.

01:01:46.039 --> 01:01:48.008
And it's all
because of her.

01:01:48.075 --> 01:01:50.677
She used Joseph.
Manipulated him.

01:01:54.214 --> 01:01:55.983
<i>You can do this.</i>

01:01:57.651 --> 01:01:59.553
<i>I know you're scared, Jericho,</i>

01:01:59.620 --> 01:02:01.255
<i>but I believe in you.</i>

01:02:01.321 --> 01:02:03.690
<i>As long as we have
each other, little brother,</i>

01:02:03.758 --> 01:02:06.861
<i>there's nothing
we can't accomplish.</i>

01:02:06.927 --> 01:02:09.129
<i>We're two parts of a whole.</i>

01:02:09.196 --> 01:02:11.031
<i>I'll never leave you.</i>

01:02:11.098 --> 01:02:13.667
<i>Never abandon you
the way they did.</i>

01:02:15.102 --> 01:02:17.004
<i>We're family.</i>

01:02:21.910 --> 01:02:24.945
Is that manipulation
or love?

01:02:30.117 --> 01:02:32.986
Thanks, Addie.
I'll take it from here.

01:02:33.053 --> 01:02:34.455
The hell you will!

01:02:34.521 --> 01:02:37.191
You don't get to decide
what I do or don't do.

01:02:37.257 --> 01:02:39.794
You've risked enough.
This is my job.

01:02:39.861 --> 01:02:42.596
I lived with risk every
damn day we were married,

01:02:42.663 --> 01:02:46.533
only, I never knew it,
did I, Deathstroke?

01:02:46.600 --> 01:02:47.735
You never told me.

01:02:47.802 --> 01:02:50.103
Please, can we stop
dredging up the past?

01:02:50.170 --> 01:02:52.206
You know there's something else
you never told me.

01:02:53.040 --> 01:02:54.308
Why?

01:02:54.374 --> 01:02:57.578
Why did you choose
Deathstroke over us?

01:02:57.644 --> 01:02:59.848
A life of deceit and risk,
instead of...

01:02:59.914 --> 01:03:02.449
I didn't choose to be
one over the other, Addie.

01:03:02.516 --> 01:03:04.084
And I didn't
choose to be this.

01:03:04.151 --> 01:03:05.519
There's always a choice.

01:03:05.586 --> 01:03:08.088
Those bastards
made me this way

01:03:08.155 --> 01:03:09.958
with their
damned experiment.

01:03:10.023 --> 01:03:11.726
And I did the best
I could with it.

01:03:11.793 --> 01:03:13.994
That was your best?

01:03:14.061 --> 01:03:16.497
A mercenary? A murderer?

01:03:17.331 --> 01:03:18.900
My father was a soldier.

01:03:18.967 --> 01:03:20.234
His father was a soldier.

01:03:20.300 --> 01:03:23.003
All I knew
was the military life.

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:24.605
So I took
that training and...

01:03:24.671 --> 01:03:26.975
Corrupted it. Spit on it.

01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.943
This world is filled with evil.

01:03:29.009 --> 01:03:31.445
On a scale
you can't comprehend.

01:03:33.080 --> 01:03:35.082
Oh, I have some idea.

01:03:35.148 --> 01:03:39.686
Then you should understand that I just
did what we did when we served together.

01:03:39.754 --> 01:03:41.188
Took down the bad guys.

01:03:41.255 --> 01:03:43.490
Don't you dare compare the two.

01:03:50.697 --> 01:03:51.833
I...

01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:53.935
I tried to be the knight
Joseph believed I was.

01:03:54.002 --> 01:03:56.004
A knight?

01:03:56.069 --> 01:03:58.238
Is that what
you think you are?

01:03:58.305 --> 01:04:01.976
Oh, my God, Slade,
are you that delusional?

01:04:02.042 --> 01:04:04.111
Joseph didn't need a knight.

01:04:04.177 --> 01:04:05.679
He needed a father.

01:04:05.747 --> 01:04:07.614
I needed a husband.

01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:12.653
What's so wrong inside you that
you preferred Deathstroke to us?

01:04:13.453 --> 01:04:15.188
My life as Deathstroke,

01:04:15.255 --> 01:04:17.157
it was separate
from my life with you.

01:04:17.224 --> 01:04:18.860
It had nothing
to do with...

01:04:18.927 --> 01:04:20.360
You really don't see it?

01:04:20.427 --> 01:04:23.230
All these years
you've been compartmentalizing.

01:04:23.297 --> 01:04:26.133
Filing pieces of yourself
away in little boxes.

01:04:26.199 --> 01:04:28.736
Lying to yourself.
And to me.

01:04:30.070 --> 01:04:32.272
Thank you.

01:04:32.907 --> 01:04:34.776
For what?

01:04:34.842 --> 01:04:39.546
For reminding me why I've chosen to
remain a bachelor all these years.

01:04:39.613 --> 01:04:43.952
Now, are you two going to spend
the day at each other's throats,

01:04:44.018 --> 01:04:47.421
or are we going to save Joseph,
and perhaps the world?

01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.515
<i>The nation
has been rocked this morning</i>

01:05:15.582 --> 01:05:19.553
<i>by what appear to be a series of
coordinated terrorist attacks.</i>

01:05:19.620 --> 01:05:22.090
<i>Moments after a hijacked
Patriot Airlines flight</i>

01:05:22.155 --> 01:05:25.292
<i>was deliberately crashed
into the Golden Gate Bridge,</i>

01:05:25.359 --> 01:05:29.964
<i>a dozen armed men launched a mass
attack in New York Times Square.</i>

01:05:30.031 --> 01:05:31.298
<i>While in Washington,</i>

01:05:31.365 --> 01:05:33.467
<i>at least one bomb,
possibly more,</i>

01:05:33.533 --> 01:05:35.703
<i>tore through
the Capitol Building.</i>

01:05:35.770 --> 01:05:38.138
<i>No estimates yet
on total casualties,</i>

01:05:38.205 --> 01:05:42.442
<i>but it's clear that hundreds of
lives have been lost, perhaps more.</i>

01:05:42.509 --> 01:05:46.546
<i>The president, just returning from
the World Economic Forum in Davos,</i>

01:05:46.613 --> 01:05:48.548
<i>remains aboard Air Force One,</i>

01:05:48.615 --> 01:05:51.652
<i>while all other flights across
the nation have been grounded.</i>

01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:53.921
God damn it!

01:05:53.988 --> 01:05:57.257
I look like a weak fool,
circling around up here,

01:05:57.324 --> 01:05:58.525
afraid to land.

01:05:58.592 --> 01:06:00.460
It has nothing to
do with fear, sir.

01:06:00.527 --> 01:06:02.063
It's for your safety.

01:06:02.130 --> 01:06:04.431
Until we know the full
extent of the attacks...

01:06:04.498 --> 01:06:06.533
The nation needs
to be reassured!

01:06:06.600 --> 01:06:10.170
And the commander-in-chief
needs to be protected.

01:06:15.043 --> 01:06:16.576
Eerie, isn't it?

01:06:16.643 --> 01:06:18.545
We're the only plane
in the sky.

01:06:23.383 --> 01:06:25.519
At least, we're supposed to be.

01:06:35.529 --> 01:06:38.298
Our attacks were
the perfect distraction.

01:06:38.365 --> 01:06:40.802
The entire country is in chaos.

01:06:40.868 --> 01:06:42.804
People are hiding away
in their little holes

01:06:42.870 --> 01:06:44.839
like the frightened rabbits
they are.

01:06:45.672 --> 01:06:48.442
And there he sits, all alone.

01:06:49.744 --> 01:06:53.981
A fat, ripe fruit,
ready for the picking.

01:06:54.048 --> 01:06:58.418
Without you, child,
none of this would be possible.

01:06:58.485 --> 01:07:00.654
If I've pleased you, sir,
then...

01:07:00.722 --> 01:07:03.157
You've more than pleased me.

01:07:03.223 --> 01:07:05.159
You've given me the world.

01:07:05.258 --> 01:07:07.061
Are you ready, son?

01:07:07.128 --> 01:07:08.796
<i>I... I think so.</i>

01:07:08.863 --> 01:07:10.664
You think?

01:07:10.732 --> 01:07:11.733
<i>I am, sir.</i>

01:07:12.399 --> 01:07:13.801
We'll swarm them.

01:07:13.868 --> 01:07:15.402
Confuse and terrify them.

01:07:15.469 --> 01:07:16.704
And when they're close enough,

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:19.741
you'll use
your astonishing gift.

01:07:19.807 --> 01:07:22.476
And our little puppet
will return to Washington.

01:07:22.542 --> 01:07:24.444
Declare martial law.

01:07:24.511 --> 01:07:27.815
The most powerful nation on Earth
will be in H.I.V.E.'s control and...

01:07:27.882 --> 01:07:29.282
And we

01:07:29.349 --> 01:07:31.853
will be in control of H.I.V.E.

01:07:32.285 --> 01:07:33.453
What?

01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:34.889
Now, Jericho!

01:07:42.496 --> 01:07:44.531
Rose?

01:07:44.598 --> 01:07:47.267
I've waited a long time
for this.

01:07:56.443 --> 01:07:59.080
You trained him well.

01:07:59.147 --> 01:08:00.580
Better than I knew.

01:08:00.647 --> 01:08:02.183
And all of this for what?

01:08:02.250 --> 01:08:04.018
Vengeance?
A righteous killing?

01:08:04.085 --> 01:08:08.222
You manipulated me from the first
moment you stepped into my life.

01:08:08.288 --> 01:08:11.259
Did you think I didn't know
what you were even then?

01:08:11.324 --> 01:08:14.327
I was a father to you.
I trained you.

01:08:14.394 --> 01:08:16.328
Helped you master
those powers.

01:08:16.395 --> 01:08:17.832
A father?

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:21.368
You used a lonely,
grief-stricken girl.

01:08:21.434 --> 01:08:24.005
But I wasn't as alone
as you believed.

01:08:24.071 --> 01:08:26.974
I had my brother, in here.

01:08:27.041 --> 01:08:30.044
Long before I ever
told you about him.

01:08:30.111 --> 01:08:33.546
And I knew what you did to him.

01:08:33.613 --> 01:08:36.448
I made you a queen.

01:08:36.515 --> 01:08:39.452
And now that queen
is taking your throne.

01:08:39.519 --> 01:08:42.290
H.I.V.E. won't use us again.

01:08:42.354 --> 01:08:45.926
No one will ever use us,
hurt us, again.

01:08:46.593 --> 01:08:48.627
We have the power.

01:08:48.694 --> 01:08:52.499
And what will you do
with all that power, Rose?

01:08:53.701 --> 01:08:56.603
I'll start by making you pay
for what you did.

01:08:56.670 --> 01:08:58.840
But not with your life.

01:08:58.906 --> 01:09:00.372
With your mind.

01:09:00.439 --> 01:09:02.442
Take him! Become him!

01:09:19.961 --> 01:09:22.897
Did you really think
I'd unleash a weapon like you

01:09:22.964 --> 01:09:25.198
without providing
myself protection?

01:09:25.265 --> 01:09:28.870
Took my best technicians eight months
to come up with psychic dampers

01:09:28.935 --> 01:09:31.906
capable of absorbing
your psionic powers,

01:09:31.973 --> 01:09:35.375
and hurling them back
in your astonished face.

01:09:41.015 --> 01:09:42.917
You knew?

01:09:42.984 --> 01:09:44.517
I suspected.

01:09:44.584 --> 01:09:47.955
After all, a guttersnipe
like you can't be trusted.

01:09:53.194 --> 01:09:54.362
Jericho.

01:09:54.427 --> 01:09:55.495
Jericho?

01:10:02.636 --> 01:10:06.774
You should know, Rose,
that family will always disappoint you.

01:10:06.841 --> 01:10:10.244
Denied the president's mind,
we'll have to take his body.

01:10:10.311 --> 01:10:13.047
I enjoy a good old-fashioned
kidnapping, don't you?

01:10:14.081 --> 01:10:16.884
Initiate Plan Jericho Two.
On my...

01:10:16.951 --> 01:10:18.753
Sir, another plane, heading our way.

01:10:18.819 --> 01:10:20.453
Who the hell
could it...

01:10:21.421 --> 01:10:22.857
Deathstroke.

01:10:36.569 --> 01:10:37.972
<i>We warned them.</i>

01:10:38.873 --> 01:10:40.808
Why didn't they listen?

01:10:40.875 --> 01:10:43.778
By the time our contacts got through to
the people who could make a difference,

01:10:43.844 --> 01:10:46.513
it was just too late.

01:10:46.579 --> 01:10:48.916
But we'll damn sure
make a difference here.

01:10:50.985 --> 01:10:53.120
These energy readings
are extraordinary.

01:10:53.187 --> 01:10:55.957
It's got to be Joseph.
He's in the lead plane.

01:10:56.023 --> 01:10:58.926
You gonna be okay
all alone, Grandpa?

01:10:58.993 --> 01:11:01.062
<i>Oy, behave yourself.</i>

01:11:01.128 --> 01:11:02.730
<i>Have you looked in the mirror
lately, you old bag of wind?</i>

01:11:02.797 --> 01:11:04.365
<i>I've got this, Slade.</i>

01:11:04.432 --> 01:11:05.665
You always do.

01:11:10.171 --> 01:11:12.139
You're not talking me
out of this.

01:11:12.206 --> 01:11:13.841
I wouldn't dream of it.

01:11:13.908 --> 01:11:16.576
You're the finest commanding
officer I've ever served under.

01:11:16.643 --> 01:11:19.880
And you get extra points
since I've seen you naked.

01:11:21.415 --> 01:11:22.883
Fuck you.

01:11:39.133 --> 01:11:40.500
How did they know?

01:11:40.567 --> 01:11:42.269
They're here now.
And maybe that's for the best.

01:11:44.271 --> 01:11:47.875
Wilson's brats may have betrayed
me and ruined my careful planning.

01:11:47.942 --> 01:11:50.811
But now their father
can have a front-row seat

01:11:50.878 --> 01:11:52.713
when his children die.

01:12:31.786 --> 01:12:32.652
What's happening?

01:12:43.397 --> 01:12:44.265
Kill them.

01:13:16.363 --> 01:13:18.065
Bravo, Rose.

01:13:18.631 --> 01:13:19.800
Bravo.

01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.235
Not bad for an old dog.

01:14:10.751 --> 01:14:13.154
No! No, no, no!

01:14:25.698 --> 01:14:28.402
<i>Air Force
One, prepare to be boarded.</i>

01:14:52.393 --> 01:14:55.362
You just saved the President
of the United States.

01:14:55.429 --> 01:14:56.864
Damn right I did.

01:15:03.070 --> 01:15:05.372
It appears we were expected.

01:15:18.852 --> 01:15:20.087
Joseph!

01:15:25.993 --> 01:15:27.428
So, tell me, Wilson.

01:15:28.229 --> 01:15:30.931
Which one do I murder first?

01:15:30.998 --> 01:15:33.601
The girl whose mother
you used for your own pleasure

01:15:33.667 --> 01:15:36.003
and then so casually
threw away?

01:15:36.070 --> 01:15:38.839
Or the boy
you so easily abandoned?

01:15:38.906 --> 01:15:41.809
Spare me the litany
of my sins, Jackal.

01:15:41.875 --> 01:15:43.577
I know them well enough.

01:15:43.644 --> 01:15:46.447
Of course. You're not
the only sinner here.

01:15:46.513 --> 01:15:49.350
Take our dear friend Rose,
for instance.

01:15:49.416 --> 01:15:52.219
She's been manipulating
her brother for years.

01:15:52.286 --> 01:15:56.190
Poisoning his mind
against you and Adeline.

01:15:56.257 --> 01:15:59.728
Making sure
his only loyalty was to her.

01:15:59.827 --> 01:16:03.797
I told him the truth.
I love Jericho.

01:16:03.864 --> 01:16:07.067
And what's love but another
way to control people?

01:16:07.534 --> 01:16:08.402
No.

01:16:10.904 --> 01:16:14.475
What you did to him was no
different from what I did to you.

01:16:14.541 --> 01:16:16.043
No.

01:16:16.110 --> 01:16:18.312
God, no!

01:16:18.379 --> 01:16:21.248
It's not the same, Rose.
You're not the same.

01:16:22.683 --> 01:16:25.720
But I did use him. I...

01:16:25.786 --> 01:16:28.455
I didn't mean to, but I did.

01:16:28.522 --> 01:16:32.159
Just because love isn't perfect,
doesn't mean it isn't real.

01:16:32.226 --> 01:16:34.895
You were there for him,
when I wasn't.

01:16:34.962 --> 01:16:37.398
Not for him.
Not for you.

01:16:41.335 --> 01:16:44.905
Hardly the time or
place for family therapy.

01:16:47.574 --> 01:16:50.144
Let them go.

01:16:52.646 --> 01:16:54.615
Say "please."

01:16:54.682 --> 01:16:57.518
Please.
They've suffered enough.

01:16:57.584 --> 01:16:59.420
Then I'll end their suffering.

01:17:01.555 --> 01:17:03.424
You fucking monster.

01:17:05.125 --> 01:17:07.127
I told you years ago, Wilson.

01:17:07.995 --> 01:17:09.630
We're two of a kind.

01:17:09.697 --> 01:17:11.532
Get the hell away
from my kids!

01:17:36.725 --> 01:17:39.693
I've performed several
major upgrades to this armor

01:17:39.761 --> 01:17:41.428
since our last battle.

01:17:41.495 --> 01:17:42.463
And, now,

01:17:43.664 --> 01:17:45.265
I'm unstoppable!

01:18:05.787 --> 01:18:07.921
Not bad.

01:18:34.648 --> 01:18:35.582
Thank you.

01:18:35.649 --> 01:18:37.050
We've got to help him.

01:18:44.258 --> 01:18:45.192
Jericho.

01:18:46.627 --> 01:18:49.129
Jericho. Joseph.

01:18:49.196 --> 01:18:51.031
I'm so sorry.

01:18:51.098 --> 01:18:53.701
- I never meant to-
- <i>I know. I...</i>

01:18:54.869 --> 01:18:56.470
<i>Mom?</i>

01:18:56.537 --> 01:18:58.105
Hey, little soldier.

01:19:18.325 --> 01:19:20.160
All these years, Jackal...

01:19:20.694 --> 01:19:23.030
Why? Why me?

01:19:23.798 --> 01:19:25.466
Why my children?

01:19:25.532 --> 01:19:29.002
Do you think you were the only
man to ever have a daughter?

01:20:02.202 --> 01:20:04.171
She was your...

01:20:04.238 --> 01:20:06.273
Yes, she was!

01:20:09.978 --> 01:20:12.079
And now, I'll take from you

01:20:12.145 --> 01:20:14.381
what you took from me.

01:20:30.597 --> 01:20:31.665
No!

01:20:43.076 --> 01:20:44.411
Slade!

01:20:56.423 --> 01:20:58.125
<i>You were right, Addie.</i>

01:21:00.127 --> 01:21:04.732
<i>All these years I've been filing
pieces of myself away in little boxes.</i>

01:21:04.799 --> 01:21:06.633
<i>Lying to myself.</i>

01:21:06.701 --> 01:21:08.268
<i>And to you.</i>

01:21:08.335 --> 01:21:10.705
<i>It was the only way
I knew how to survive.</i>

01:21:12.040 --> 01:21:13.574
<i>I'm not a knight, my love.</i>

01:21:15.910 --> 01:21:17.277
<i>I never was.</i>

01:21:19.814 --> 01:21:24.518
<i>But maybe now I can be
the man you always needed.</i>

01:21:28.355 --> 01:21:30.290
- Can you?
- I can try.

01:21:37.431 --> 01:21:39.199
How long can you keep it there?

01:21:39.266 --> 01:21:40.969
<i>As long as I have to.</i>

01:21:41.035 --> 01:21:43.403
<i>I'm not losing you again.</i>

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:47.507
I'll get us down fast.

01:21:58.585 --> 01:22:00.387
Wintergreen,
can you see them?

01:22:02.222 --> 01:22:03.690
No, I...

01:22:03.758 --> 01:22:05.692
Wait! There!

01:22:05.760 --> 01:22:08.562
You get to ground.
I'll try to reach Slade.

01:22:13.600 --> 01:22:15.302
This has been fun, Wilson.

01:22:19.439 --> 01:22:21.976
But it's time to
say our good-byes.

01:22:22.043 --> 01:22:24.511
This isn't gonna
end well for you.

01:22:28.548 --> 01:22:30.818
Not for you either, asshole.

01:22:32.185 --> 01:22:34.154
What?

01:22:34.221 --> 01:22:36.891
<i>Joseph, I love you.</i>

01:22:41.963 --> 01:22:42.897
Slade!

01:22:42.964 --> 01:22:44.164
<i>Papa!</i>

01:22:53.074 --> 01:22:57.945
<i>"The land was filled with
dragons and the people were afraid.</i>

01:22:58.012 --> 01:23:00.782
<i>But the Shining Knight
came riding forth</i>

01:23:00.848 --> 01:23:04.184
<i>to protect both
man and maid.</i>

01:23:04.251 --> 01:23:06.319
<i>He faced
the fiercest creatures</i>

01:23:06.386 --> 01:23:08.856
<i>that the world
had ever known.</i>

01:23:08.923 --> 01:23:11.893
<i>And he did it all
to save us.</i>

01:23:11.959 --> 01:23:13.660
<i>For the knight was not alone."</i>

01:23:13.728 --> 01:23:16.831
<i>Oh, how he loved reading
that book to you.</i>

01:23:18.265 --> 01:23:19.967
<i>That...</i>

01:23:20.034 --> 01:23:21.568
<i>That was a long time ago.</i>

01:23:25.139 --> 01:23:26.506
<i>The past is dead.</i>

01:23:34.015 --> 01:23:35.315
He needs time.

01:23:36.084 --> 01:23:37.819
We all need time.

01:23:37.885 --> 01:23:41.288
Do you think he survived?

01:23:41.354 --> 01:23:43.991
Not even he could
have survived that.

01:23:51.631 --> 01:23:52.967
I'll be leaving tomorrow.

01:23:53.801 --> 01:23:54.802
And going where?

01:23:58.206 --> 01:24:00.407
You stay as long
as you need to.

01:24:00.474 --> 01:24:02.009
We're family now.

01:24:02.076 --> 01:24:06.680
Dysfunctional as
hell, but we're family.

01:24:32.006 --> 01:24:34.776
<i>"The land was filled
with dragons,</i>

01:24:34.842 --> 01:24:37.611
