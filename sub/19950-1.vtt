00:09.836 --> 00:12.100
Do you insist on going, Father?

00:13.139 --> 00:15.334
Will you stop me, Sesshomaru?

00:17.477 --> 00:18.808
I won't try to stop you.

00:19.012 --> 00:21.310
However, before you go...

00:21.648 --> 00:25.607
please entrust the swords,
Sounga and Tetsusaiga, to me.

00:26.653 --> 00:29.781
And if I say I won't,

00:29.856 --> 00:31.847
will you kill me, your own father?

00:37.931 --> 00:40.058
Do you desire power so much?

00:42.135 --> 00:44.467
Why do you seek power?

00:45.638 --> 00:48.368
The path I walk is
the Way of Supreme Conquest.

00:48.675 --> 00:51.542
And it is power that will
reveal the way for me.

00:53.146 --> 00:54.807
The Way of Supreme Conquest, huh?

00:56.049 --> 00:57.516
Tell me Sesshomaru...

00:57.584 --> 01:00.576
Have you someone to protect?

01:02.355 --> 01:03.822
Someone to protect?

01:09.896 --> 01:14.856
I, Sesshomaru, have no need
of such.

01:53.106 --> 01:54.835
Please wait, Lord Takemaru!

01:54.941 --> 01:57.307
The Princess is in labor!

01:57.477 --> 02:00.241
She is going to have a child
fathered by a demon!

02:00.313 --> 02:02.008
There is no need
for decorum!

02:02.448 --> 02:04.814
A man must not enter!

02:05.685 --> 02:07.118
Lord Takemaru...?

02:17.430 --> 02:18.658
Dearest...

02:23.736 --> 02:26.466
<i>Have you someone to protect?</i>

02:30.577 --> 02:31.669
Ridiculous!

02:36.950 --> 02:39.111
You must not do this!
Do not be rash!

02:39.185 --> 02:41.119
Please reconsider!

02:41.287 --> 02:46.452
The wounds from your battle
with Ryukotsusei have not healed!

02:46.993 --> 02:49.257
I cannot let her die!

02:49.495 --> 02:51.725
- But...!
- Besides...

02:51.965 --> 02:53.865
I am not long for this world.

02:53.933 --> 02:55.332
Master!

03:05.845 --> 03:07.540
A lunar eclipse...

03:08.047 --> 03:10.982
A perfect night to
slay a demon.

03:16.522 --> 03:17.921
Who is it?

03:18.324 --> 03:20.815
It is I, Takemaru of Setsuna.

03:21.861 --> 03:23.260
Takemaru?

03:24.464 --> 03:26.193
Thank goodness
you are here.

03:26.633 --> 03:31.195
Gather the men outside
and leave immediately.

03:31.537 --> 03:35.667
There is no one who can
defy him.

03:36.009 --> 03:42.642
My Lady Izayoi, I have long felt
a deep attachment towards you.

03:43.216 --> 03:47.846
Even if your heart has been
captured by a demon...!

04:01.267 --> 04:03.827
My feelings for you will
never change.

04:13.179 --> 04:15.943
Izayoi! I am coming!

04:39.439 --> 04:43.170
Wind Scar!

05:07.700 --> 05:09.930
Izayoi! Izayoi!

05:12.138 --> 05:16.404
So you've come, demon!
A little late, though.

05:16.576 --> 05:17.543
What?

05:17.777 --> 05:21.076
Lady Izayoi is in
a place beyond your reach.

05:21.147 --> 05:23.308
I sent her there myself.

05:23.883 --> 05:24.872
Fool!

05:37.563 --> 05:39.030
Set it afire!

05:39.098 --> 05:41.362
Burn down this mansion...

05:41.434 --> 05:43.095
along with its occupants
and the demon!

05:58.284 --> 05:59.148
Izayoi!

06:00.253 --> 06:01.345
Izayoi!

06:10.963 --> 06:13.193
I'm counting on you, Tenseiga!

06:41.461 --> 06:44.191
I have no regrets since
I am fighting you.

06:44.430 --> 06:47.297
Let us journey together
to the netherworld!

06:49.068 --> 06:50.535
Live!

06:51.170 --> 06:52.296
My dear...!

06:59.011 --> 07:00.171
Inuyasha.

07:01.347 --> 07:02.405
What?

07:02.582 --> 07:07.246
The infant's name.
The infant shall be named Inuyasha.

07:09.055 --> 07:10.283
Inuyasha?

07:11.157 --> 07:13.057
Now go!

07:14.026 --> 07:15.084
Yes!

07:31.377 --> 07:32.674
Izayoi...

07:32.745 --> 07:36.010
You must live. Live long.

07:37.283 --> 07:40.047
Together with Inuyasha.

08:07.279 --> 08:07.579
<i>My name is Kagome Higurashi.</i>

08:07.579 --> 08:09.481
<i>My name is Kagome Higurashi.
Inuyasha!</i>

08:09.481 --> 08:09.810
<i>My name is Kagome Higurashi.</i>

08:10.482 --> 08:12.746
<i>I was your average middle schooler,</i>

08:12.818 --> 08:13.318
<i>until one day, I fell into an ancient well
in our family shrine</i>

08:13.318 --> 08:15.754
<i>until one day, I fell into an ancient well
in our family shrine
What took you so long?
I've been starving!</i>

08:15.754 --> 08:15.787
What took you so long?
I've been starving!

08:15.787 --> 08:16.755
<i>And passed through time
into the feudal era.
What took you so long?
I've been starving!</i>

08:16.755 --> 08:18.848
<i>And passed through time
into the feudal era.</i>

08:19.424 --> 08:21.326
<i>There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha
who is part demon and part human.</i>

08:21.326 --> 08:22.327
<i>There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha
who is part demon and part human.
No thanks!</i>

08:22.327 --> 08:24.129
<i>There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha
who is part demon and part human.</i>

08:24.129 --> 08:24.563
<i>There, I met a half demon named Inuyasha
who is part demon and part human.
Got anything better?</i>

08:24.563 --> 08:25.630
Got anything better?

08:25.630 --> 08:26.098
<i>He's so moody and spoiled,
but oh so strong!
Got anything better?</i>

08:26.098 --> 08:26.231
<i>He's so moody and spoiled,
but oh so strong!</i>

08:26.231 --> 08:28.100
<i>He's so moody and spoiled,
but oh so strong!
- Hey, I went to a lot of trouble
- All I'm saying is</i>

08:29.735 --> 08:33.364
<i>Inuyasha has a demon brother
named Sesshomaru</i>

08:33.438 --> 08:37.772
<i>who covets the Tetsusaiga, a sword
passed down from their father.</i>

08:38.943 --> 08:42.140
<i>Even though he already has
a sword, the Tenseiga.</i>

08:42.313 --> 08:44.578
I said, I'll protect you!

08:53.558 --> 08:54.923
<i>Presently, our group includes</i>

08:54.993 --> 08:55.994
<i>Miroku, a monk who has a Wind Tunnel
in his palm which will swallow up anything.</i>

08:55.994 --> 08:58.030
<i>Miroku, a monk who has a Wind Tunnel
in his palm which will swallow up anything.
Hey Inuyasha!</i>

08:58.030 --> 08:58.063
Hey Inuyasha!

08:58.063 --> 08:59.231
<i>And Sango the Demon Slayer.
Hey Inuyasha!</i>

08:59.231 --> 09:00.198
<i>And Sango the Demon Slayer.</i>

09:00.399 --> 09:03.960
<i>Along with Shippo,
the young fox demon,</i>

09:04.036 --> 09:06.834
<i>we journey in search of
the Shikon Jewel shards.</i>

09:07.272 --> 09:08.774
Inuyasha!
You didn't have to eat it all!

09:08.774 --> 09:10.609
<i>At first, it was hard living
in the feudal era,
Inuyasha!
You didn't have to eat it all!</i>

09:10.609 --> 09:10.675
<i>At first, it was hard living
in the feudal era,</i>

09:10.675 --> 09:11.510
<i>At first, it was hard living
in the feudal era,
Inuyasha!</i>

09:11.676 --> 09:12.938
<i>But I've grown accustomed to it</i>

09:13.011 --> 09:15.881
<i>and through great teamwork,
I'm managing fine.</i>

09:15.881 --> 09:16.748
<i>And through great teamwork,
I'm managing fine.
- You lecherous monk!
- But Sango</i>

09:16.748 --> 09:17.214
- You lecherous monk!
- But Sango

09:17.282 --> 09:18.214
Sit boy!

09:21.820 --> 09:25.950
<i>And besides, I get to return to
the present time once in a while like this.</i>

09:35.833 --> 09:36.993
There it comes!

09:39.036 --> 09:39.832
Kagome!

09:40.471 --> 09:41.165
Okay!

09:42.239 --> 09:42.830
Go!

09:43.107 --> 09:43.732
Yuka!

09:44.208 --> 09:44.902
I'll get it!

09:47.144 --> 09:48.133
Watch it, Kagome!

09:53.451 --> 09:55.214
Hey! Where's the ball?!

09:55.619 --> 09:57.917
Did someone just call you, Kagome?

09:57.989 --> 10:00.423
Didn't something just
pass us by?

10:01.859 --> 10:05.818
Yeah! Just try and hurt Kagome
with somethin' like this!

10:07.331 --> 10:08.889
Hey Kagome!

10:09.166 --> 10:10.531
Over here! Hey!

10:11.135 --> 10:11.897
Sit!

10:13.537 --> 10:15.164
What's wrong, Kagome?

10:16.207 --> 10:18.198
What did you mean by "sit"?

10:18.476 --> 10:19.738
Oh...

10:19.910 --> 10:21.810
Did I say that?

10:22.046 --> 10:23.707
You sure did!

10:24.181 --> 10:24.943
Yeah...

10:25.516 --> 10:28.644
Oh... I meant vinegar is good.

10:28.719 --> 10:29.617
Vinegar?

10:29.887 --> 10:31.855
You know vinegar is good
for you, right?

10:31.956 --> 10:35.619
Grandpa always tells me to sip vinegar
'cause it's good for your health.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.484
But... oww...

10:37.728 --> 10:40.026
I think I drank too much
and now I have a tummy ache.

10:40.564 --> 10:42.088
- 'Scuse me, okay?
- Are you all right?

10:49.306 --> 10:50.238
I'm home.

10:50.408 --> 10:51.841
Welcome back, Sota.

10:51.942 --> 10:53.068
What's that?

10:53.144 --> 10:54.475
Oh that...

10:55.046 --> 10:57.708
A family shrine treasure a sword passed
down from generation to generation

10:57.782 --> 10:59.443
known as the Sword of Murakumo.

11:00.418 --> 11:01.442
That's what it is.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.344
Oh...

11:03.888 --> 11:07.551
The Sword of Murakumo is the alternate
name for the Sword of Kusanagi

11:07.625 --> 11:09.650
which appears in the annals
of the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki.

11:09.960 --> 11:13.088
In other words, it is
a national treasure.

11:14.165 --> 11:17.726
Geez! Why'd you come
to my school?!

11:17.935 --> 11:20.062
I didn't want anything
to happen to you.

11:21.272 --> 11:25.231
I have to watch out for you
since you always get into scrapes.

11:25.476 --> 11:28.343
This time period isn't as
dangerous as yours.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.808
Grrr...

11:39.824 --> 11:42.122
I was just playing volleyball
it's a sport.

11:42.593 --> 11:44.584
Rather, it's like exercise.

11:44.929 --> 11:48.330
<i>Exercise?
Is it a game like kemari?</i>

11:48.766 --> 11:50.358
Yes, that's precisely it!

11:50.468 --> 11:52.026
Have you ever played?

11:54.572 --> 11:57.268
I don't have nice memories
about it.

12:25.536 --> 12:28.505
<i>That was the time I saw
my mother's tears.</i>

12:31.542 --> 12:32.270
Inuyasha?

12:33.444 --> 12:35.071
- What?
- Is something wrong?

12:35.646 --> 12:37.079
No, it's nothing.

12:38.916 --> 12:42.283
By the way, can't you do something
about the Beads of Subjugation?

12:42.520 --> 12:45.921
If you keep telling me to "sit,"
my body won't hold up.

12:46.357 --> 12:49.292
Do I say "sit" that often...?

12:50.327 --> 12:52.352
Oops, sorry!
I didn't mean that.

12:52.429 --> 12:53.726
It's too late!

13:01.272 --> 13:04.173
This is the grave of
Inuyasha's mother?

13:04.642 --> 13:05.574
Yes.

13:06.010 --> 13:08.570
She was very beautiful.

13:09.747 --> 13:14.013
It's been many years since
Lady Izayoi passed away.

13:14.685 --> 13:17.051
But Master Inuyasha still misses her.

13:17.922 --> 13:20.049
Did you place those
flowers there, Myoga?

13:20.291 --> 13:23.055
Oh no...
It was probably Master Inuyasha.

13:23.227 --> 13:26.628
So there is a kind side of him.

13:26.797 --> 13:29.994
Yes...
He is half human.

13:30.067 --> 13:34.026
He can't help but have some traits
that are unbecoming of demons.

13:35.673 --> 13:38.107
So being kind is not a good thing?

13:40.444 --> 13:41.536
There!

13:45.115 --> 13:51.350
Now then, the Sword of Murakumo
is the magical sword

13:51.422 --> 13:57.418
<i>that Prince Susano Oh found inside the
beast, Yamata no Orochi, which he slew.</i>

13:58.796 --> 14:01.788
And we take it out once in a while
and give it an airing.

14:01.899 --> 14:04.561
But there is rust on this sword

14:04.635 --> 14:06.762
and I can't remove it from
its sheathe.

14:07.805 --> 14:09.238
There!

14:09.340 --> 14:10.830
I've made space for it here.

14:11.141 --> 14:12.904
There's something written on this.

14:13.344 --> 14:16.575
It says Sword of Murakumo.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.849
But doesn't this last
character mean "fang"?

14:20.184 --> 14:21.276
What!?

14:21.585 --> 14:24.281
Then it must be read Sounga.

14:24.421 --> 14:26.685
Hah! So it's a fake!

14:26.824 --> 14:28.519
No, that's impossible!

14:28.926 --> 14:31.053
This is a sword of true value,

14:31.128 --> 14:33.289
found by our forefather's
forefather generations ago

14:33.364 --> 14:35.457
in the ancient well.

14:35.766 --> 14:38.030
That makes it sound even
more fake.

14:38.202 --> 14:42.070
No! There is a scroll which
describes the event.

14:42.139 --> 14:43.731
Now where was it?

14:43.807 --> 14:45.502
Oh, isn't that it?

14:47.244 --> 14:48.734
This sword bites!

14:49.413 --> 14:51.278
Don't be silly!

14:52.716 --> 14:54.980
<i>Hey, when did I bite?</i>

14:56.086 --> 14:57.815
This sword can speak!

14:58.055 --> 15:01.183
<i>I am the one speaking.
Not Sounga.</i>

15:01.258 --> 15:04.989
Oh! Only in our shrine could
such a treasured sword be found!

15:05.696 --> 15:06.492
<i>Oh no....</i>

15:06.563 --> 15:09.361
<i>The 700 year old seal
will be broken.</i>

15:09.533 --> 15:12.024
What?! A 700 year old seal?

15:12.603 --> 15:15.265
<i>Sounga will be free of me.</i>

15:15.572 --> 15:16.334
<i>Hey!</i>

15:16.407 --> 15:18.238
<i>Is there a strong demon nearby?</i>

15:18.442 --> 15:19.431
A demon?

15:19.543 --> 15:21.272
<i>Oh dear.. . What a bind I'm in!</i>

15:21.345 --> 15:25.076
<i>The Sounga is a terrible demon sword!
Terrible things will happen.. !</i>

15:30.621 --> 15:31.645
<i>Hey Sounga!</i>

15:31.722 --> 15:33.053
<i>Where are you going?!</i>

15:33.590 --> 15:34.852
<i>Wait! Hey!</i>

15:36.460 --> 15:37.791
It went away.

15:38.495 --> 15:40.986
Our family treasure!

15:44.001 --> 15:46.595
- What's that?
- Looks like a sword?

15:46.670 --> 15:49.264
- A sword?
- But can a sword fly?!

15:51.208 --> 15:53.699
- Something's coming!
- Huh? Where, where?

15:53.777 --> 15:54.744
What's that?!

16:00.651 --> 16:01.583
What's that?!

16:01.819 --> 16:03.753
Man, it hurts...

16:03.821 --> 16:06.517
I said I'm sorry.
Now put the hat on.

16:07.057 --> 16:07.751
Huh?

16:10.427 --> 16:11.894
A strong demonic aura!

16:14.965 --> 16:15.659
Stand back!

16:17.868 --> 16:20.462
<i>Finally, it's calmed down.</i>

16:21.071 --> 16:22.231
What?

16:22.940 --> 16:24.931
<i>Well, well!
If it isn't Tetsusaiga!</i>

16:25.008 --> 16:26.202
<i>It's been a long time.</i>

16:26.276 --> 16:27.140
What?

16:27.211 --> 16:29.645
<i>Could you be Inuyasha?</i>

16:31.248 --> 16:33.580
I don't know any swords!

16:34.017 --> 16:37.350
<i>Well, I don't blame you
for not remembering.</i>

16:37.788 --> 16:41.622
<i>You were just a newborn back then.</i>

16:42.760 --> 16:44.250
<i>I am Saya.</i>

16:44.328 --> 16:46.888
<i>The sheathe of Sounga,</i>

16:46.964 --> 16:50.900
<i>the famous sword of Supreme Conquest
wielded by your father.</i>

16:51.402 --> 16:52.494
My father?

16:53.103 --> 16:55.401
<i>Oh no....
It's acting up again!</i>

16:58.642 --> 17:01.202
<i>This sword....
I have a really bad feeling about it.</i>

17:02.079 --> 17:03.512
<i>Hey Inuyasha!</i>

17:03.881 --> 17:05.815
<i>Hurry and take hold of Sounga!</i>

17:06.116 --> 17:08.584
<i>Otherwise, terrible things will happen!</i>

17:09.219 --> 17:11.710
I don't take orders from you!

17:13.991 --> 17:16.585
<i>Oh, it's too late!</i>

17:23.066 --> 17:24.464
<i>It's freed itself!</i>

17:52.696 --> 17:53.890
This is...

17:54.231 --> 17:55.289
What is this?

17:55.666 --> 17:57.861
<i>Can the two of you see it?</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:01.936
<i>This is the future
of this land</i>

18:02.005 --> 18:04.166
<i>which Sounga will bring about.</i>

18:05.242 --> 18:07.176
This is... the future?

18:07.344 --> 18:10.040
<i>Sounga's frightening power will</i>

18:10.113 --> 18:13.412
<i>make the skies dark and
cause the lands to decay.</i>

18:13.484 --> 18:15.179
<i>And people will die.</i>

18:15.519 --> 18:17.384
What do we do
to prevent this from happening?

18:17.721 --> 18:20.815
<i>Take Sounga and
leave this land.</i>

18:21.492 --> 18:24.518
<i>However, a human must
not wield Sounga.</i>

18:24.728 --> 18:26.218
<i>And if a human did
take hold of it?</i>

18:26.597 --> 18:28.087
<i>It will be the end
of this world.</i>

18:29.199 --> 18:30.996
<i>Anyone wielding the Sounga</i>

18:31.068 --> 18:33.662
<i>will continue killing until
every other human is killed,</i>

18:33.737 --> 18:37.002
<i>whether it takes decades
or centuries.</i>

18:37.641 --> 18:41.372
<i>Humans are more egotistical
and greedy</i>

18:41.445 --> 18:42.969
<i>than any other living creature.</i>

18:44.047 --> 18:47.175
<i>When a human possesses
the power of the Sounga,</i>

18:47.251 --> 18:50.618
<i>he becomes more evil
than any demon alive.</i>

18:52.890 --> 18:56.018
Can't be helped. I'll put the sword
back in its sheathe.

18:56.326 --> 18:57.384
Inuyasha...

18:58.028 --> 18:59.086
Inuyasha!

19:34.765 --> 19:36.027
I'm so relieved!

19:39.670 --> 19:40.500
Here, your hat.

19:40.571 --> 19:41.469
Stay away!

19:54.451 --> 19:55.418
Inuyasha!

20:04.127 --> 20:04.889
Inuyasha...!

20:08.899 --> 20:11.299
What IS this sword anyway?!

20:13.270 --> 20:15.761
<i>So you are his son?</i>

20:16.106 --> 20:18.768
Are you... Sounga?!

20:19.076 --> 20:24.139
<i>And you think you are strong
enough to subdue me?</i>

20:25.148 --> 20:27.639
<i>Obey me!</i>

20:28.118 --> 20:32.282
<i>And I shall make you supreme ruler
of these lands.</i>

20:32.556 --> 20:34.046
Shaddup!

20:35.359 --> 20:37.850
I ain't interested in
such a thing!

20:46.036 --> 20:49.472
There's a better place
for you to be!

20:49.539 --> 20:51.803
I'll take you there!

20:53.143 --> 20:54.371
Inuyasha...!

20:56.346 --> 20:57.779
I'll go get rid of this!

20:58.015 --> 21:00.245
Get rid of it?
How?

21:00.550 --> 21:02.040
It's my old man's sword!

21:02.786 --> 21:06.552
I should be able to do
something about it!

21:06.657 --> 21:07.385
But...!

21:07.858 --> 21:09.416
Don't follow me!

21:10.794 --> 21:12.125
I'm going, Kagome.

21:12.195 --> 21:12.991
Inuyasha!

21:19.569 --> 21:21.628
<i>What a relief!</i>

21:21.705 --> 21:25.106
<i>It's a burden off my shoulders
and I can breathe easy.</i>

21:25.242 --> 21:26.004
Stupid!

21:27.444 --> 21:29.036
Stupid Inuyasha!

21:29.613 --> 21:31.274
Acting so proud!

21:31.915 --> 21:35.180
Trying to do everything
by yourself!

21:35.919 --> 21:38.717
Why can't you rely
on me a bit more?!

21:46.930 --> 21:49.922
Hey... You're the sheathe
of that sword, aren't you?

21:50.200 --> 21:51.667
<i>That I am...</i>

21:52.102 --> 21:54.900
Then you can suppress
the power of the sword?

21:56.873 --> 21:59.137
<i>Well, I wonder....</i>

21:59.376 --> 22:00.934
You can, can't you?

22:02.379 --> 22:05.280
I can't say until I try...

22:05.682 --> 22:07.115
Then it's decided.

22:15.625 --> 22:16.592
What is that?

22:17.027 --> 22:18.187
That's...

22:18.261 --> 22:19.990
It's coming from
the Bone Eater's Well.

22:20.564 --> 22:22.156
T That's ridiculous!

22:24.434 --> 22:25.924
Tenseiga?

22:27.137 --> 22:29.571
What's the matter, Lord Sesshomaru?

22:33.977 --> 22:36.104
Lord Sesshomaru laughed!

22:36.646 --> 22:38.944
Something bad is about
to happen.

22:45.822 --> 22:47.255
Is that you, Inuyasha?

22:48.358 --> 22:49.586
Shippo, get away!

22:51.528 --> 22:53.655
Get... away!

22:59.603 --> 23:01.594
Inuyasha, what's wrong with you?!

23:18.288 --> 23:20.222
Stop! Inuyasha!

23:22.092 --> 23:24.253
A demon! A demon is coming!

23:25.095 --> 23:25.823
What?!

23:25.896 --> 23:28.228
Everyone run! A demon!

23:28.999 --> 23:29.988
Help!

23:34.304 --> 23:35.396
Help!

23:36.573 --> 23:37.938
Inuyasha!
Huh?!

23:50.487 --> 23:52.648
He's not the usual Inuyasha.

23:52.889 --> 23:54.516
Whatever happened to him?

23:57.861 --> 24:01.160
What's going on?! That's Sounga!

24:13.276 --> 24:15.836
<i>Kill them! Kill them!</i>

24:25.922 --> 24:28.152
Stop, Inuyasha!
Come back to your senses!

24:28.692 --> 24:31.456
<i>What's wrong, Inuyasha?
Kill them!</i>

24:31.528 --> 24:32.961
<i>Kill them, I said.</i>

24:35.932 --> 24:37.695
Snap out of it, Inuyasha!

24:38.335 --> 24:40.599
<i>Do it! Kill them!</i>

24:41.771 --> 24:45.104
<i>Silence its noisy cries!
Do it!</i>

24:46.209 --> 24:47.176
Stop!

24:53.717 --> 24:54.684
<i>Why you!</i>

24:55.652 --> 24:56.448
Inuyasha!

24:56.753 --> 24:58.482
<i>So you won't heed my words?</i>

25:01.157 --> 25:03.352
<i>Kill them! Kill them!</i>

25:07.264 --> 25:10.392
Miroku... take them away quickly!

25:17.474 --> 25:20.443
- What's happened to Inuyasha?
- I don't know.

25:20.510 --> 25:21.977
Something is wrong with him!

25:22.445 --> 25:23.104
Shippo!

25:25.882 --> 25:26.507
Inuyasha!

25:27.117 --> 25:29.483
Stay back! Get away from me!

25:29.552 --> 25:32.817
<i>I'll send you all to hell!</i>

25:34.791 --> 25:36.349
Oh no!
It's the Dragon Twister!

25:36.559 --> 25:38.527
Everyone, take to the skies!

25:43.900 --> 25:45.026
Kirara! Please go!

25:48.171 --> 25:49.968
Dragon Twister!

26:00.817 --> 26:02.011
How frightening!

26:02.252 --> 26:04.345
Such incomprehensible power!

26:04.554 --> 26:07.250
That was the Dragon Twister,
the attack of a dragon from hell!

26:07.657 --> 26:11.024
Its destructive power surpasses
even the Backlash Wave.

26:11.428 --> 26:13.191
We must stop Inuyasha quickly!

26:13.630 --> 26:15.860
If we approach him now,
we'll all be killed!

26:16.099 --> 26:17.225
Let's wait for Kagome.

26:17.500 --> 26:18.933
That's all we can do
at this point.

26:56.306 --> 26:58.103
It's quiet now.

26:58.475 --> 27:01.308
It used up its power
with that Dragon Twister.

27:02.312 --> 27:04.507
And now it needs to recoup, huh?

28:00.103 --> 28:00.831
'Morning!

28:01.104 --> 28:02.071
Kagome...

28:02.138 --> 28:03.571
Kagome!

28:07.710 --> 28:09.200
What happened here?

28:09.612 --> 28:12.513
<i>Did Inuyasha use
the Dragon Twister?</i>

28:12.916 --> 28:15.180
W Who was it that
just spoke?

28:15.318 --> 28:17.980
<i>It was me!
Anything wrong with that?</i>

28:18.154 --> 28:20.679
<i>Am I bothering you?</i>

28:21.091 --> 28:24.219
He's awfully touchy, this guy.

28:24.994 --> 28:25.983
It's you, Saya!

28:26.062 --> 28:29.327
Why does Inuyasha have
the Sounga?

28:29.466 --> 28:33.061
<i>It's been awhile, Myoga!
Still running away from things?</i>

28:33.303 --> 28:34.634
Answer my question!

28:34.771 --> 28:36.739
<i>Well, things have happened.</i>

28:37.006 --> 28:38.439
You're the one who told me

28:38.508 --> 28:40.908
you'd take care of things
for about 700 years.

28:40.977 --> 28:42.740
You slacked off again, huh?!

28:42.979 --> 28:44.207
<i>What're you saying?</i>

28:44.280 --> 28:47.306
<i>I kept strict guard
for 200 years!</i>

28:47.550 --> 28:49.347
The numbers don't add up!

28:49.619 --> 28:54.079
Umm... Maybe passing through the Bone
Eater's well had something to do with it?

28:54.357 --> 28:55.949
<i>The Bone Eater's Well?</i>

28:57.494 --> 29:00.122
Oh Kagome! You're back!

29:00.330 --> 29:01.297
Sango!

29:01.931 --> 29:03.364
Now we're all together.

29:03.933 --> 29:06.902
Let's follow the trail
of the Dragon Twister.

29:18.214 --> 29:21.183
Is it that sword which
awakened us?

29:21.284 --> 29:24.447
We have protected this land
for ages.

29:24.521 --> 29:26.045
This is an forgivable act!

29:26.156 --> 29:29.853
Now, you shall taste the power
and wrath of the great Ogre tribe!

29:29.959 --> 29:31.051
Prepare to die!

29:42.739 --> 29:43.569
Dammit!

29:59.789 --> 30:01.381
<i>Good, Inuyasha.</i>

30:01.891 --> 30:07.022
<i>Your heart is steadily trying
to become one with mine.</i>

30:07.697 --> 30:10.757
Lord Sesshomaru!
Please wait!

30:10.900 --> 30:15.496
Lord Sesshomaru!
Where are you headed?

30:17.941 --> 30:20.068
<i>Is it close, Tenseiga?</i>

30:20.510 --> 30:22.102
<i>But this scent....</i>

30:24.147 --> 30:25.205
Kagome, look!

30:25.615 --> 30:26.809
Dead demons!

30:29.819 --> 30:31.116
I'll go take a look.

30:31.321 --> 30:33.255
You stay here, Kagome.

30:36.159 --> 30:37.626
I hope it's safe.

30:38.461 --> 30:40.952
It hasn't been long
since it died.

30:41.231 --> 30:43.256
I still sense an evil aura
close by.

30:45.835 --> 30:47.860
Is it Sounga's aura?

30:47.937 --> 30:49.768
<i>Huh? Well.. . Yes.</i>

30:56.112 --> 30:57.636
It's supposed to be dead!

30:58.414 --> 30:59.472
<i>I just remembered!</i>

30:59.549 --> 31:04.987
<i>Those slain by Sounga come back
as soul less undead creatures!</i>

31:05.054 --> 31:05.816
What?!

31:07.957 --> 31:08.889
Hiraikotsu!

31:15.932 --> 31:16.728
It's still alive!

31:18.201 --> 31:19.293
Wind Tunnel!

31:27.176 --> 31:28.074
Miroku!

31:29.679 --> 31:30.771
Are you all right?!

31:30.880 --> 31:33.576
<i>Their corpses contain
potent miasma!</i>

31:33.650 --> 31:35.345
<i>You shouldn't take them in.</i>

31:35.652 --> 31:38.519
I wish you'd said so sooner!

31:38.888 --> 31:40.014
What'll we do then?

31:40.390 --> 31:42.950
<i>Fire! Burning them is the best way!</i>

31:43.026 --> 31:44.960
That's my cue!

31:52.435 --> 31:53.299
Fox Fire!

31:57.607 --> 31:59.939
<i>Not enough fire power.</i>

32:03.212 --> 32:04.042
Kirara!

32:20.663 --> 32:21.595
Are you all right?

32:23.099 --> 32:23.963
Thank you!

32:31.808 --> 32:32.775
Miroku!

32:33.309 --> 32:34.105
Kagome!

32:34.310 --> 32:36.778
Never mind me.
Go and find Inuyasha!

32:37.146 --> 32:39.876
- But...
- I'll look after Miroku.

32:40.283 --> 32:43.411
If more of these appear,
we won't be able to handle them.

32:43.486 --> 32:44.885
All right, I understand.

33:12.148 --> 33:14.548
<i>So it is you, Inuyasha.</i>

33:16.953 --> 33:19.979
How did one like you come
to possess the Sounga?

33:20.523 --> 33:23.924
Don't tell me that another one of
Father's swords chose you?

33:24.193 --> 33:25.626
How would I know?!

33:25.695 --> 33:28.391
I'd gladly give this one to you...

33:29.332 --> 33:31.960
but it seems you're gonna have
to take it by force.

33:34.504 --> 33:35.937
I intended to anyway.

33:41.110 --> 33:42.236
Master Jaken...

33:42.378 --> 33:44.676
Lord Sesshomaru and Inuyasha
are siblings,

33:44.747 --> 33:46.476
but they really don't get along, do they?

33:46.816 --> 33:48.943
Must you state the obvious?!

33:49.952 --> 33:53.752
<i>But Lord Sesshomaru is
very angry.</i>

33:54.157 --> 33:58.059
<i>Has Inuyasha's possession
of the sword upset him that much?</i>

33:58.661 --> 34:03.030
<i>But in retrospect, Lord Sesshomaru's
father was so heartless!</i>

34:03.099 --> 34:05.693
<i>Entrusting the powerful swords
only to Inuyasha....</i>

34:05.835 --> 34:10.204
<i>and leaving Lord Sesshomaru
the useless Tenseiga!</i>

34:22.185 --> 34:25.813
You are not fit to wield
the Sounga or the Tetsusaiga!

34:25.888 --> 34:29.483
The fact that Father's blood flows through
your veins is unforgivable.

34:30.525 --> 34:32.426
Who cares about that!

34:35.898 --> 34:39.594
<i>Sesshomaru, do you covet
the Sounga?</i>

34:40.168 --> 34:44.230
<i>When our blades clash,
I can read you completely.</i>

34:44.440 --> 34:47.273
<i>Even about Inuyasha cutting
off your left arm.</i>

34:47.743 --> 34:50.177
Shut your damn mouth for a second!

35:00.957 --> 35:02.185
He must be there!

35:04.861 --> 35:06.590
Totosai!

35:06.929 --> 35:08.487
Oh, it's you Kagome.

35:09.732 --> 35:11.927
<i>Totosai, it's been awhile.</i>

35:12.001 --> 35:14.595
Oh Saya, you're here too, eh?

35:14.837 --> 35:16.429
You're all acquaintances?

35:16.939 --> 35:19.840
Totosai, you must have
guessed already...

35:20.076 --> 35:24.445
I never thought that
Sounga would return...

35:24.580 --> 35:26.775
<i>Inuyasha has it now.</i>

35:26.916 --> 35:30.784
What? Inuyasha doesn't have
the power to control it.

35:30.953 --> 35:32.921
<i>I had a suspicion about that....</i>

35:32.989 --> 35:35.389
Why did you make such
a dangerous sword?

35:35.458 --> 35:37.016
That wasn't me.

35:37.093 --> 35:40.221
The Great Dog Demon had it
from long ago.

35:40.296 --> 35:43.163
He's right. Unlike Tetsusaiga
and Tenseiga,

35:43.232 --> 35:46.895
Sounga is possessed by the spirit of
an ancient evil demon.

35:47.069 --> 35:49.196
With the Great Dog Demon gone,

35:49.272 --> 35:53.606
the only one who can wield the Sounga
is probably Sesshomaru.

35:53.709 --> 35:55.370
Lord Sesshomaru!

36:03.419 --> 36:07.617
<i>What's the matter, Inuyasha?
Can't win it alone?</i>

36:07.790 --> 36:10.350
<i>Then use my power!</i>

36:22.772 --> 36:24.933
L Lord Sesshomaru is on
the defensive!

36:26.809 --> 36:29.937
<i>Two blood brothers killing each other....</i>

36:30.079 --> 36:33.105
<i>You two are just as foolish
as your father was.</i>

36:33.482 --> 36:36.076
<i>If he had heeded my words,</i>

36:36.152 --> 36:40.646
<i>he would not have met
such a miserable death.</i>

36:40.790 --> 36:41.779
Silence!

37:01.243 --> 37:02.369
Amazing!

37:02.612 --> 37:04.671
You must hand it to
Lord Sesshomaru!

37:17.660 --> 37:19.150
<i>How can this be?</i>

37:19.362 --> 37:22.525
<i>I have never seen Lord Sesshomaru
brought to his knees!</i>

37:24.033 --> 37:25.694
Such a persistent one!

37:27.069 --> 37:27.933
<i>Blood....</i>

37:28.004 --> 37:29.335
<i>Not enough blood.</i>

37:29.438 --> 37:32.430
<i>Give me a live sacrifice!</i>

37:35.978 --> 37:36.967
He's coming!

37:38.214 --> 37:39.078
Stop!

37:42.518 --> 37:43.280
Don't come any closer!

37:48.891 --> 37:50.085
Sit boy!

37:51.727 --> 37:52.921
<i>What is this?!</i>

37:54.363 --> 37:56.160
SIT BOY!

38:01.871 --> 38:03.532
<i>Damn wench!</i>

38:10.112 --> 38:11.136
Master Jaken!

38:13.482 --> 38:14.710
Oh dear...

38:16.485 --> 38:21.787
Oh, it seems Sounga has
been driven off.

38:22.158 --> 38:24.285
Leave it to Kagome!

38:35.705 --> 38:38.299
<i>Ohh! You're back to
your old self, Inuyasha!</i>

38:38.541 --> 38:40.270
<i>You are free of Sounga.</i>

38:41.010 --> 38:42.637
<i>It's all due to this girl.</i>

38:42.745 --> 38:48.547
Inu... yasha... I came.
I'm sorry.

38:48.951 --> 38:50.111
Kagome!

38:50.486 --> 38:51.510
Hey Kagome!

38:52.421 --> 38:55.151
Dammit! That's why I told
you to stay away!

39:02.431 --> 39:03.363
Wait!

39:05.067 --> 39:09.333
I'll destroy the Sounga!
I don't want your interference!

39:10.139 --> 39:11.572
It is impossible for you.

39:11.941 --> 39:12.737
What?!

39:13.008 --> 39:14.976
Be grateful to that girl.

39:17.113 --> 39:20.173
Master Jaken, wake up!
Lord Sesshomaru is leaving!

39:21.584 --> 39:24.018
Master Inuyasha, I'm so glad
you are safe.

39:24.086 --> 39:25.713
- Myoga...
- Yes?

39:26.122 --> 39:28.317
What was my old man like?

39:28.724 --> 39:32.319
Well... He had tasty blood.

39:32.394 --> 39:35.659
Never mind that!
Was he strong?

39:35.865 --> 39:39.164
Well, he was a great demon, so...

39:40.069 --> 39:41.798
Was he stronger than I am right now?

39:41.871 --> 39:44.465
Well...

39:44.607 --> 39:45.574
'Fess up!

39:45.908 --> 39:49.776
The Great Dog Demon was
a thousand times stronger.

39:49.912 --> 39:53.370
He never made the mistake of
allowing Sounga to control him.

39:55.484 --> 39:56.678
I see...

40:01.857 --> 40:02.949
Master Inuyasha!

40:03.025 --> 40:04.219
Take care of Kagome.

40:04.326 --> 40:07.386
Huh? Where do you intend
to go?

40:07.663 --> 40:09.130
Isn't it obvious?

40:10.432 --> 40:12.832
How can I let Sounga
get away?

40:13.602 --> 40:16.002
Well then, take Saya with you.

40:16.906 --> 40:20.569
<i>Err.. . I really don't want to go....</i>

40:25.014 --> 40:28.279
<i>Kagome, I can't involve you.</i>

40:29.852 --> 40:33.583
<i>I'll do something about my
old man's sword myself.</i>

40:37.426 --> 40:42.022
<i>Why did Father leave me,
not the Sounga nor Tetsusaiga...</i>

40:42.298 --> 40:45.096
<i>but the Tenseiga?</i>

41:14.430 --> 41:18.230
<i>Not much of a body,
but better than nothing.</i>

41:37.219 --> 41:40.188
<i>With this, I can use
the Dragon Twister.</i>

41:40.823 --> 41:45.556
<i>I shall destroy both
the Tetsusaiga and the Tenseiga!</i>

42:00.376 --> 42:03.504
<i>Awaken, Takemaru of Setsuna!</i>

42:03.779 --> 42:06.077
<i>I am Sounga.</i>

42:06.916 --> 42:08.713
<i>Sounga?</i>

42:09.351 --> 42:11.842
<i>Why do you call me
from the dead?</i>

42:12.354 --> 42:17.053
<i>I, Sounga, shall save
your wandering soul.</i>

42:17.459 --> 42:19.723
<i>Take revenge with me.</i>

42:20.195 --> 42:22.720
<i>Against the sons of the one
who killed you....</i>

42:22.798 --> 42:25.892
<i>take revenge against
Sesshomaru and Inuyasha.</i>

42:26.101 --> 42:29.434
<i>Unleash your pent up grudge!</i>

42:29.872 --> 42:30.998
Grudge?

42:31.273 --> 42:33.833
<i>The woman who abandoned you....</i>

42:35.144 --> 42:36.975
<i>Izayoi!</i>

42:37.680 --> 42:40.649
<i>You loved that woman.</i>

42:42.885 --> 42:44.876
<i>And he stole your woman.</i>

42:45.187 --> 42:46.552
<i>Hate him!</i>

42:46.889 --> 42:48.254
<i>Hate the woman!</i>

42:48.724 --> 42:50.624
<i>Hate his sons!</i>

42:51.126 --> 42:56.063
<i>Otherwise, your soul will
forever be chained here.</i>

42:56.999 --> 42:59.126
<i>Now, I call upon you!</i>

42:59.368 --> 43:02.895
<i>Let us take revenge against
his sons!</i>

43:04.373 --> 43:05.499
<i>Hate!</i>

43:06.642 --> 43:10.942
<i>I hate Inuyasha.. . And Sesshomaru!</i>

43:11.013 --> 43:13.538
<i>And I hate Izayoi!</i>

43:23.392 --> 43:27.886
A sword which makes a man keep on
killing until the world is destroyed...

43:28.964 --> 43:32.991
In ages past, countless men sought
to be the supreme ruler of this world

43:33.068 --> 43:36.799
and searched for the Sounga,
stole it, and killed each other.

43:37.172 --> 43:40.369
The one who stopped
this senseless cycle...

43:40.743 --> 43:43.610
Was Inuyasha's father?

43:43.946 --> 43:44.935
Yes.

43:46.181 --> 43:48.547
Oh Kagome, you're conscious!

43:50.152 --> 43:51.050
Where's Inuyasha?

43:52.621 --> 43:54.452
Where did Inuyasha go?

43:54.990 --> 43:57.618
Hah! Who cares about Inuyasha!

43:57.693 --> 43:59.661
Why are you both here?

43:59.728 --> 44:04.131
Well... It's not that
Lord Sesshomaru left us...

44:05.067 --> 44:07.035
- He did, didn't he?
- Uh huh.

44:08.170 --> 44:09.603
Don't say anything!

44:10.272 --> 44:13.435
I can't stay here!
I must catch up to Lord Sesshomaru!

44:13.542 --> 44:15.203
No, Master Jaken.

44:15.277 --> 44:17.609
We must thank Kagome properly.

44:19.381 --> 44:23.875
I didn't ask to be saved!
That girl acted willfully!

44:24.920 --> 44:26.012
Here!

44:27.322 --> 44:28.812
The enchanted beads...

44:29.091 --> 44:30.649
You gathered them?

44:31.093 --> 44:33.118
I'm not sure if they're all there.

44:33.462 --> 44:34.451
Thank you.

44:34.763 --> 44:38.597
No, I should thank you for
saving me.

44:42.171 --> 44:46.335
Can no one stop Inuyasha now?

44:50.412 --> 44:54.815
Stupid Inuyasha!
He's such a bother!

44:54.883 --> 44:57.113
It's all your fault, Saya!

44:57.653 --> 44:58.711
Saya!

44:59.855 --> 45:01.789
<i>Huh? What?
What's the matter?</i>

45:02.157 --> 45:06.150
You said you could seal the Sounga
for about 700 years.

45:07.162 --> 45:08.220
<i>Did I?</i>

45:08.697 --> 45:12.292
But why was the Sounga
at our shrine?

45:13.001 --> 45:15.902
It can't be helped...
Let us tell you the tale.

45:16.271 --> 45:18.831
This goes back about
200 years...

45:19.074 --> 45:22.407
when Inuyasha's father died.

45:26.248 --> 45:27.613
Master!

45:28.117 --> 45:29.846
Don't cry, Myoga.

45:30.252 --> 45:33.688
Crying won't bring back
the great Dog Demon.

45:33.789 --> 45:35.882
I know that, but...

45:36.058 --> 45:40.154
By the way, did you take care of the
Tetsusaiga according to his will?

45:40.329 --> 45:41.557
Naturally!

45:41.630 --> 45:46.033
I sealed it behind the black pearl
together with the Master's body.

45:47.035 --> 45:50.732
And I made sure Tenseiga was
passed on to Sesshomaru.

45:51.039 --> 45:51.440
FOR SESSHOMARU

45:51.440 --> 45:53.175
FOR SESSHOMARU
You didn't give it to him yourself?

45:53.175 --> 45:53.607
FOR SESSHOMARU

45:53.709 --> 45:55.734
Why would I do such a
dangerous thing?

45:55.811 --> 45:58.075
I want to live a long life!

45:59.248 --> 46:01.944
Which leaves this problem the Sounga.

46:02.751 --> 46:03.911
Saya...

46:04.119 --> 46:08.021
Are you sure Master didn't leave
any instructions for the Sounga?

46:08.190 --> 46:11.785
<i>No, he only left instructions
for Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga.</i>

46:12.094 --> 46:13.061
Oh dear...

46:13.128 --> 46:17.792
Knowing the Master, he must have
good reason for this.

46:18.100 --> 46:20.796
But what a problem he
left us with.

46:22.871 --> 46:25.305
The Tetsusaiga which
their father wielded,

46:25.374 --> 46:27.399
along with the Tenseiga and Sounga

46:27.476 --> 46:29.535
were known as the three swords
of supreme conquest,

46:29.611 --> 46:32.671
with the power to dominate
the three worlds.

46:33.382 --> 46:34.110
Three worlds?

46:34.616 --> 46:38.950
Heaven, Hell, and Earth
are the three worlds.

46:39.855 --> 46:43.416
Heaven, where the Buddha and
gods reside.

46:43.792 --> 46:46.693
Hell, the netherworld.
The world of the dead.

46:47.062 --> 46:50.896
And Earth, this world
in which we reside.

46:51.934 --> 46:55.426
Each sword corresponded
to one world...

46:55.571 --> 46:59.063
Heaven's Tenseiga could save
a hundred lives in one sweep.

46:59.775 --> 47:02.243
Sounga of Hell could open
the gateway to the netherworld

47:02.311 --> 47:04.541
and summon a hundred dead souls
in one sweep.

47:05.380 --> 47:07.746
Tetsusaiga, the guardian of men,

47:07.816 --> 47:09.875
could fell a hundred enemies
in one sweep.

47:10.652 --> 47:13.917
And Inuyasha's father possessed
all three swords?

47:13.989 --> 47:15.217
So greedy!

47:15.390 --> 47:17.415
And then what happened?

47:17.793 --> 47:20.421
We couldn't think of
a good solution,

47:20.495 --> 47:22.292
and we were in a dilemma.

47:22.898 --> 47:26.732
<i>How about letting Sesshomaru
have it?</i>

47:26.802 --> 47:27.962
Don't be ridiculous!

47:28.036 --> 47:31.563
He's upset with us
over Tenseiga.

47:31.807 --> 47:34.037
If he finds us,
we'll all be killed.

47:34.309 --> 47:37.403
And Inuyasha is just an infant.

47:37.980 --> 47:40.380
<i>If it's just to keep the Sounga quiet,</i>

47:40.449 --> 47:43.282
<i>I think I could hold on to it
for about 700 years.</i>

47:44.119 --> 47:45.279
<i>I guess I have no choice....</i>

47:45.354 --> 47:49.256
<i>Throw me into the Bone Eater's Well
in the land of Musashi.</i>

47:49.491 --> 47:51.152
- Bone Eater's Well?
- Bone Eater's Well?

47:51.293 --> 47:54.694
<i>I've heard that if a demon's corpse
is thrown into the well,</i>

47:54.763 --> 47:57.254
<i>it will disappear somewhere.</i>

47:57.499 --> 47:59.228
<i>That would work, wouldn't it?</i>

48:00.535 --> 48:02.628
And that's how it came to
be at our shrine?

48:03.138 --> 48:06.471
<i>Now although it's only been
200 years here,</i>

48:06.541 --> 48:10.534
<i>beyond the well,
it's been a good 700 years.</i>

48:10.746 --> 48:14.375
Why is it that Kagome doesn't age when
she passes through the well?

48:14.549 --> 48:15.516
<i>Well....</i>

48:15.784 --> 48:19.276
<i>It is the Bone Eater's Well swirling
with demonic aura.</i>

48:19.554 --> 48:23.490
So Saya, is there a way to
defeat the Sounga?

48:24.626 --> 48:25.752
<i>Just one.</i>

48:27.095 --> 48:29.063
<i>With Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga.</i>

48:29.298 --> 48:32.597
<i>Pitted one on one, Sounga
will be stronger.</i>

48:33.001 --> 48:37.904
<i>But with the two swords combined,
it is possible to beat Sounga.</i>

48:38.507 --> 48:40.441
Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga?

48:41.176 --> 48:43.906
If Inuyasha and Sesshomaru
join forces...

48:49.251 --> 48:52.743
Lord Sesshomaru join forces
with Inuyasha?!

48:52.821 --> 48:53.753
Are you crazy?!

48:53.855 --> 48:56.289
Hell will freeze over
before that happens!

48:56.391 --> 48:57.619
I agree with him.

48:57.759 --> 48:59.056
Same here.

48:59.194 --> 49:00.024
Me too.

49:00.562 --> 49:04.396
Saya, can't you seal the Sounga
one more time?

49:04.566 --> 49:06.227
<i>Don't ask the impossible.</i>

49:06.335 --> 49:09.668
<i>I've hung in there for a thousand years,
and I'm exhausted.</i>

49:09.771 --> 49:11.636
Wasn't it 200 hundred years?

49:11.707 --> 49:14.335
I've aged quite a lot.

49:15.010 --> 49:18.343
Kagome, don't be too hopeful
about that.

49:18.413 --> 49:21.473
Exactly! You can't rely on Saya.

49:21.917 --> 49:22.474
<i>Huh?!</i>

49:29.324 --> 49:31.724
<i>Takemaru, use this....</i>

49:32.260 --> 49:33.022
What is it?

49:33.795 --> 49:35.660
<i>Sesshomaru's left arm.</i>

49:39.201 --> 49:42.398
<i>With that arm, you can produce
the Dragon Twister.</i>

49:43.038 --> 49:45.598
<i>You will have no rival
in this universe.</i>

49:45.674 --> 49:47.972
<i>It will do you good
to test it.</i>

50:08.463 --> 50:11.330
The path of the supreme conqueror
who knows no rival, huh?

50:25.013 --> 50:26.708
Rejoice, everyone!

50:26.815 --> 50:28.510
Our castle is in sight!

50:30.519 --> 50:32.953
We celebrate our triumphant
return tonight!

50:33.121 --> 50:34.952
Drink up and make merry!

50:42.564 --> 50:44.122
Huh? W What is it?

50:45.066 --> 50:46.829
Such a strange cloud movement.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.994
Hurry men!
The rain is coming!

50:58.513 --> 50:59.878
Open the gate!

51:04.553 --> 51:05.645
What's going on?!

51:19.501 --> 51:20.559
W Who are you?!

51:21.403 --> 51:23.997
I am called Takemaru of Setsuna.

51:25.607 --> 51:27.006
Men!

51:32.214 --> 51:34.409
Dragon Twister!

52:05.847 --> 52:10.341
This arm doesn't heed my
instructions too well.

52:21.997 --> 52:25.023
<i>What was the Sounga doing
in a place like this?</i>

52:37.612 --> 52:39.443
Takemaru of Setsuna...

52:40.215 --> 52:43.343
The Sounga chose that vermin?

52:43.952 --> 52:44.976
You know him?

52:47.589 --> 52:51.184
That's unusual.
This is a human burial site.

52:51.693 --> 52:54.423
Just what's your connection
to this?

52:55.196 --> 52:57.323
I have no connection
to that vermin.

52:57.566 --> 53:00.057
If there is a connection,
it is to you.

53:01.002 --> 53:01.832
Me?

53:02.237 --> 53:04.501
Humph... You probably aren't aware.

53:05.440 --> 53:07.032
You were born ignorant,

53:07.108 --> 53:09.668
and you live as an
ignorant half demon.

53:11.613 --> 53:14.639
So then, you can die ignorant!

53:16.585 --> 53:19.053
Die and give me that Tetsusaiga!

53:20.922 --> 53:22.981
Well, it looks like
you've forgotten something!

53:23.191 --> 53:26.285
That Tetsusaiga's barrier rejects you!

53:26.661 --> 53:28.322
That may be so.

53:28.396 --> 53:31.024
But I'll have enough time to
kill that worm!

53:31.833 --> 53:35.428
I'll destroy the old man's sword!
You stay out of it!

53:35.704 --> 53:37.968
You don't even know what
Father looked like!

53:38.039 --> 53:39.404
So don't talk big!

53:47.182 --> 53:50.117
You merely received
Father's sword!

53:50.352 --> 53:52.115
Just what...

53:52.187 --> 53:53.586
can a half demon like you do?!

53:58.827 --> 54:00.294
Sorry if I'm a half demon!

54:00.762 --> 54:03.356
But seeing as I've beaten
you time and again,

54:03.431 --> 54:05.729
you're just a loser dog!

54:07.602 --> 54:08.830
Behold...

54:09.170 --> 54:10.797
Dragon Strike!

54:12.907 --> 54:14.738
I was expecting somethin' like that!

54:15.176 --> 54:17.167
Backlash Wave!

54:26.254 --> 54:30.520
<i>Sesshomaru, why do
you seek power?</i>

54:31.326 --> 54:32.418
<i>Father....</i>

54:32.761 --> 54:35.696
<i>I wanted to defeat you,
the one with supreme power.</i>

54:36.798 --> 54:38.390
<i>Yet you died....</i>

54:38.466 --> 54:41.958
<i>for the sake of a mortal woman
and Inuyasha.</i>

54:42.537 --> 54:46.803
<i>You, the one with the ultimate power....
the one I was supposed to beat!</i>

54:47.676 --> 54:51.578
<i>Inuyasha! You and your mother
caused his miserable death!</i>

54:54.149 --> 54:55.548
W What?!

54:56.151 --> 54:58.210
My Backlash Wave...!

55:12.067 --> 55:15.036
This was as much as the Tokijin
could manage...

55:15.970 --> 55:18.131
I failed in killing him again.

55:32.654 --> 55:35.680
Sheathe... Did you protect me?

55:37.559 --> 55:41.586
Inuyasha never spoke about
his father.

55:42.397 --> 55:43.625
When I asked why,

55:43.698 --> 55:46.258
he'd say because he didn't even know
what his father looked like.

55:47.368 --> 55:52.396
But then, why is he so obsessed
with his father's sword?

55:52.774 --> 55:55.299
Why is he trying to resolve
everything all alone?

55:55.944 --> 55:58.674
That's how boys are.

55:59.180 --> 56:02.946
A boy's father is always at
the forefront of one's consciousness.

56:03.685 --> 56:06.483
How can I put it...?
It's very irritating.

56:07.889 --> 56:10.153
What your father can do,
you can do.

56:10.325 --> 56:12.691
And one day, you'll surpass him.

56:13.261 --> 56:17.129
For boys, a father is
a role model.

56:18.099 --> 56:21.262
Then if one's father is great,
that's tough.

56:21.836 --> 56:23.201
Well, I guess so.

56:23.638 --> 56:26.698
Hey! Keep your hands to yourself
when you talk!

56:26.908 --> 56:28.808
Oh, I got this habit from
my father.

56:28.877 --> 56:31.209
I must overcome it
someday, too.

56:33.081 --> 56:34.480
Forget it!

56:37.886 --> 56:38.853
When you think about it,

56:38.920 --> 56:40.945
Inuyasha's desire to get the
Sacred Jewel shards

56:41.022 --> 56:42.455
to become a full fledged demon

56:42.524 --> 56:45.789
all boils down to his wish to
become a great demon like his father.

56:46.361 --> 56:49.660
You're right. Though he's already
strong enough.

56:50.064 --> 56:54.262
<i>Damn! I don't even "know what
Father looked like, " huh?</i>

56:54.903 --> 56:59.704
<i>You're lucky, Sesshomaru.
You know what the old man looked like.</i>

57:01.176 --> 57:04.543
<i>You've spoken with the old man.</i>

57:10.685 --> 57:12.949
Fallen soldiers all!

57:13.555 --> 57:15.853
Rise from the dead!

58:24.826 --> 58:29.786
Now come anytime!
Sesshomaru and Inuyasha!

58:34.002 --> 58:36.937
<i>I shall wield Father's Sounga
with this arm....</i>

58:37.805 --> 58:42.174
<i>At that moment, I shall have the
same power as Father.</i>

58:49.918 --> 58:54.446
Tetsusaiga, looks like we're gonna
be in a huge battle.

59:00.995 --> 59:03.555
That cloud...
What an ominous air...

59:03.898 --> 59:07.231
It seems as though that is
Sounga's citadel.

59:07.402 --> 59:08.369
Let's hurry!

59:09.103 --> 59:13.130
<i>Kagome, are you serious
about going?</i>

59:13.341 --> 59:14.569
Of course!

59:14.776 --> 59:18.212
<i>But just what is the meaning
of this?</i>

59:18.613 --> 59:19.443
Meaning?

59:19.647 --> 59:21.877
<i>I understand Inuyasha's
involvement in this.</i>

59:21.950 --> 59:25.408
<i>But there's no reason for
you to fight.</i>

59:25.853 --> 59:27.252
<i>So why do you?</i>

59:27.755 --> 59:29.518
<i>Are you fond of fighting?</i>

59:29.857 --> 59:31.188
<i>I am not!</i>

59:31.793 --> 59:35.490
I hate fighting, but I want
to stay by Inuyasha's side.

59:35.830 --> 59:37.229
That's all.

59:38.399 --> 59:39.593
<i>Oh dear....</i>

59:39.767 --> 59:43.567
<i>No matter how old I get,
I will never understand humans.</i>

59:43.738 --> 59:45.262
I completely agree.

59:45.406 --> 59:46.464
Same here.

59:49.844 --> 59:50.708
Forward!

01:00:05.193 --> 01:00:07.753
<i>You are an interesting man....</i>

01:00:08.763 --> 01:00:12.722
<i>With Dragon Twister, it would
be over in a second.</i>

01:00:13.101 --> 01:00:15.592
But then my hatred will
not subside.

01:00:15.737 --> 01:00:20.037
I want those two to
suffer to the fullest.

01:00:20.208 --> 01:00:21.539
Fine...

01:00:40.094 --> 01:00:43.086
So many of them.

01:00:43.464 --> 01:00:45.523
They're all dead soldiers...

01:00:45.900 --> 01:00:47.868
He's killed too many!

01:00:48.536 --> 01:00:52.370
<i>That Sounga.. . He used the
Dragon Twister yet again.</i>

01:00:52.907 --> 01:00:54.670
There are about 2000 enemy soldiers.

01:00:55.043 --> 01:00:58.012
Excluding Myoga, Rin and Momo
from fighting,

01:00:58.079 --> 01:00:59.603
there are eight of us
plus two demons.

01:01:01.049 --> 01:01:02.914
That's 200 soldiers for each of us.

01:01:03.484 --> 01:01:06.715
But how do we kill
the living dead?

01:01:07.188 --> 01:01:11.056
<i>If you weaken the demonic aura
around them, they can be destroyed.</i>

01:01:11.159 --> 01:01:12.888
<i>It will take time, though.</i>

01:01:13.227 --> 01:01:14.558
Hey Miroku...

01:01:14.762 --> 01:01:17.731
Why isn't a weak, little guy
like me excluded from fighting?

01:01:17.965 --> 01:01:21.765
What are you saying?
We're depending on you...

01:01:21.869 --> 01:01:23.461
and your Fox Fire.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:25.932
Oh... oh I see!

01:01:26.140 --> 01:01:29.234
Jaken, fire works well against them!

01:01:29.911 --> 01:01:31.401
We're counting on you!

01:01:33.314 --> 01:01:36.306
I'll show them the power
of the Staff of Two Heads!

01:01:36.384 --> 01:01:38.249
You're trembling with fear!

01:01:38.319 --> 01:01:41.516
Silly! I'm trembling with excitement!

01:01:46.294 --> 01:01:47.124
Rain...

01:01:47.795 --> 01:01:49.626
Huh?!
Inuyasha!

01:02:20.061 --> 01:02:21.585
I have no business with you guys!

01:02:21.662 --> 01:02:22.629
Where's your leader?!

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:26.189
Where's this Takemaru who
has the Sounga?!

01:02:40.815 --> 01:02:42.544
Go!

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:53.557
Geez, I don't want to waste my strength
on something like this!

01:02:56.998 --> 01:02:59.466
Take this!
Staff of Two Heads!

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:01.693
Go, Master Jaken!

01:03:02.170 --> 01:03:03.330
Hiraikotsu!

01:03:03.905 --> 01:03:04.564
Sacred Sutras!

01:03:08.442 --> 01:03:10.637
Take this!
Fox Fire!

01:03:15.983 --> 01:03:17.644
Aghh! It doesn't work too well!

01:03:19.120 --> 01:03:20.348
Move! Move!

01:03:22.623 --> 01:03:24.113
Outta my way!

01:03:35.636 --> 01:03:38.537
Even a demon's strength will weaken...

01:03:38.806 --> 01:03:40.068
And that moment...

01:03:40.775 --> 01:03:42.072
is the moment of victory!

01:04:01.829 --> 01:04:02.386
Damn!

01:04:10.037 --> 01:04:10.799
They're close.

01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.371
Dragon Strike!

01:04:17.011 --> 01:04:18.239
Is that Sesshomaru?

01:04:18.779 --> 01:04:22.078
<i>Takemaru, destroy the Tenseiga.</i>

01:04:22.183 --> 01:04:23.309
Understood.

01:04:23.884 --> 01:04:26.546
Shattering the Tenseiga is
a simple task.

01:04:31.525 --> 01:04:34.050
The fang of a weak demon...
That's all it is.

01:04:34.362 --> 01:04:35.454
Poison Claw!

01:04:36.731 --> 01:04:37.629
You're in the way!

01:04:48.242 --> 01:04:49.641
<i>Tenseiga....</i>

01:04:49.844 --> 01:04:52.438
<i>A sword I wouldn't miss
if I lost it, but....</i>

01:04:53.714 --> 01:04:54.806
<i>Father....</i>

01:05:00.588 --> 01:05:02.419
That's Lord Sesshomaru's...!

01:05:16.404 --> 01:05:17.769
What is this?

01:05:17.838 --> 01:05:19.772
<i>You there, Rin!</i>

01:05:20.107 --> 01:05:22.098
<i>He wants the Tenseiga!</i>

01:05:22.510 --> 01:05:25.172
No! This belongs to Lord Sesshomaru!

01:05:27.248 --> 01:05:28.613
Kagome!

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:29.907
Kagome!

01:05:31.218 --> 01:05:32.207
Kagome!

01:05:33.454 --> 01:05:36.252
Help... Lord Sesshomaru!

01:05:38.826 --> 01:05:39.588
Kagome!

01:05:55.443 --> 01:05:56.239
<i>Huh?</i>

01:05:56.677 --> 01:05:57.473
Who is that?

01:05:57.912 --> 01:06:02.372
<i>Takemaru of Setsuna who fought
with Inuyasha's father 200 years ago.</i>

01:06:03.551 --> 01:06:07.112
<i>Hmm.. . You brought something
very interesting.</i>

01:06:07.455 --> 01:06:11.687
<i>Huh?! That Sounga has possessed
Takemaru!</i>

01:06:11.892 --> 01:06:16.852
<i>Takemaru.. . These young girls are just
like Izayoi.</i>

01:06:16.964 --> 01:06:19.797
<i>That Izayoi whom you killed.</i>

01:06:20.835 --> 01:06:21.893
Izayoi?

01:06:22.236 --> 01:06:23.601
Who's Izayoi?

01:06:23.838 --> 01:06:25.567
<i>Inuyasha's mother!</i>

01:06:25.973 --> 01:06:28.840
Then he killed Inuyasha's mother?

01:06:29.443 --> 01:06:33.379
<i>If you kill that girl, how will
Inuyasha react?</i>

01:06:39.353 --> 01:06:41.583
Hey stop!
Don't come near!

01:06:43.624 --> 01:06:45.455
You are both Izayoi!

01:06:45.726 --> 01:06:50.925
Females who share an affinity
with demons are all Izayoi!

01:06:51.565 --> 01:06:54.534
<i>This guy.. . He's stark crazy!</i>

01:06:55.269 --> 01:06:56.566
Move, move!

01:07:06.781 --> 01:07:07.509
Sesshomaru!

01:07:07.882 --> 01:07:09.281
Useless fool!

01:07:09.350 --> 01:07:11.375
So what are you doing here?

01:07:11.452 --> 01:07:12.384
Shaddup!

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:18.280
Sesshomaru!

01:07:18.359 --> 01:07:21.226
When this is over,
we'll settle things for good!

01:07:22.062 --> 01:07:24.394
If you live that long!

01:07:25.499 --> 01:07:28.593
You'd better not be killed
by anyone else!

01:07:36.143 --> 01:07:37.041
How's that?!

01:07:39.613 --> 01:07:40.807
Hold it!

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.280
That's dirty, Sesshomaru!

01:07:54.061 --> 01:07:55.323
Come then!

01:07:55.830 --> 01:07:57.889
<i>What're you going to do with that?</i>

01:07:58.032 --> 01:07:59.624
It can put up a barrier
or something, right?!

01:08:01.335 --> 01:08:03.701
A rusty old sheathe is useless.

01:08:03.771 --> 01:08:04.863
<i>What?!</i>

01:08:05.105 --> 01:08:06.037
Kagome!

01:08:09.343 --> 01:08:10.571
How dare you?!

01:08:10.778 --> 01:08:13.212
A man shouldn't hurt girls!

01:08:14.181 --> 01:08:16.546
Rin, run away...

01:08:16.617 --> 01:08:17.743
Don't worry!

01:08:17.818 --> 01:08:21.015
Lord Sesshomaru will save
us without fail!

01:08:21.689 --> 01:08:24.953
Resign yourselves and
go to the netherworld.

01:08:25.593 --> 01:08:26.287
Rin!

01:08:26.594 --> 01:08:27.582
Die!

01:08:27.661 --> 01:08:28.957
Lord Sesshomaru!

01:08:36.904 --> 01:08:38.564
Lord Sesshomaru!

01:08:42.910 --> 01:08:46.140
Go! You'll only be
in my way!

01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:48.411
Let's go, Rin!

01:08:48.582 --> 01:08:50.640
Lord Sesshomaru! Here!

01:08:53.354 --> 01:08:54.321
Hurry and go.

01:08:54.889 --> 01:08:55.719
Yes.

01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:08.591
You're late.

01:09:10.638 --> 01:09:12.002
That left arm...

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:16.403
Yes, it's yours.
Want it back?

01:09:17.211 --> 01:09:18.200
No thanks!

01:09:24.285 --> 01:09:25.115
Damn!

01:09:33.093 --> 01:09:36.995
Their bodies are imitations...
but their swords are real?!

01:09:38.698 --> 01:09:39.961
There's no end to this!

01:09:44.971 --> 01:09:46.064
Inuyasha!

01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:47.370
You all...!

01:10:00.788 --> 01:10:02.779
Aren't you exhausted, Inuyasha?!

01:10:04.625 --> 01:10:07.822
I didn't ask for help!

01:10:07.895 --> 01:10:09.988
Don't be so proud, Inuyasha!

01:10:10.264 --> 01:10:12.858
This is none of your business!

01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.468
Yeah, this is none of our business!

01:10:17.504 --> 01:10:20.337
But we're your friends!

01:10:24.945 --> 01:10:26.913
Heh, just do as you please!

01:10:30.918 --> 01:10:32.351
How does it feel?

01:10:32.419 --> 01:10:34.979
To be killed by your own hand?

01:10:35.689 --> 01:10:37.919
Is that all you were?

01:10:38.058 --> 01:10:38.922
What?

01:10:39.460 --> 01:10:42.395
You haven't noticed that
you're just Sounga's puppet.

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:45.228
You actually believe that
it's your power...

01:10:45.299 --> 01:10:46.926
Such a miserable specter you are.

01:10:47.034 --> 01:10:48.058
Silence!

01:10:48.369 --> 01:10:51.668
You'll suffer the same humiliation
your father wrought upon me!

01:10:56.010 --> 01:10:56.704
What?!

01:11:02.316 --> 01:11:03.715
Be honored...

01:11:03.851 --> 01:11:06.615
You will be killed
with my father's fang!

01:11:07.521 --> 01:11:08.385
Hah!

01:11:11.928 --> 01:11:13.293
This way, Rin!

01:11:27.010 --> 01:11:28.068
Kagome!

01:11:36.319 --> 01:11:37.081
Kirara!

01:11:44.194 --> 01:11:45.161
I'm here!

01:11:55.972 --> 01:11:58.304
There're still so many!

01:12:00.076 --> 01:12:01.441
Everyone all right?

01:12:02.345 --> 01:12:04.404
I'm fine! I can manage!

01:12:05.715 --> 01:12:06.704
Shippo!

01:12:08.151 --> 01:12:09.083
Kirara!

01:12:16.426 --> 01:12:18.018
Oh dear, this is troublesome.

01:12:22.832 --> 01:12:23.924
Sango!

01:12:26.836 --> 01:12:31.603
Inuyasha, leave this to us.
Hurry and go to Kagome!

01:12:31.975 --> 01:12:32.703
Miroku!

01:12:33.843 --> 01:12:35.572
I'll take care of the rest
with my Wind Tunnel.

01:12:36.112 --> 01:12:37.409
Now hurry!

01:12:37.914 --> 01:12:39.677
A All right.

01:12:41.184 --> 01:12:42.242
Miroku!

01:12:44.020 --> 01:12:45.021
If you use the Wind Tunnel...

01:12:45.021 --> 01:12:47.353
You've all reached your limits.

01:12:47.591 --> 01:12:51.027
Besides, if I don't use it
for the woman I love...

01:12:51.394 --> 01:12:53.828
what good will it do to have this?

01:12:55.165 --> 01:12:56.325
Miroku...

01:12:56.933 --> 01:12:59.697
You two!
The enemy's right behind you!

01:13:02.472 --> 01:13:04.463
Now you living dead!

01:13:04.908 --> 01:13:06.432
Find peace!

01:13:06.710 --> 01:13:07.642
Wind Tunnel!

01:13:24.928 --> 01:13:26.987
Miroku... I owe you one!

01:13:36.039 --> 01:13:37.063
Miroku...

01:13:49.386 --> 01:13:50.148
Miroku!

01:13:52.088 --> 01:13:54.579
Hang on! Don't die!

01:14:01.965 --> 01:14:05.025
What can you do with
a sword that can't kill?!

01:14:05.735 --> 01:14:08.431
It can't kill humans,
but it can kill the living dead!

01:14:24.954 --> 01:14:28.287
What? Can't even kill a corpse?

01:14:29.693 --> 01:14:31.388
Release Kagome!

01:14:35.131 --> 01:14:36.098
Kagome!

01:14:38.968 --> 01:14:40.663
Thank you, Rin!

01:14:48.478 --> 01:14:49.740
<i>That's no good!</i>

01:14:52.048 --> 01:14:54.243
Oh! I keep missing.

01:14:54.617 --> 01:14:56.847
Move, you klutz!

01:15:06.529 --> 01:15:07.518
Inuyasha!

01:15:07.764 --> 01:15:10.961
I guess you can't do
without me, huh?

01:15:11.668 --> 01:15:13.533
Don't tell me that
was also "sports"?

01:15:13.803 --> 01:15:14.701
No, it wasn't.

01:15:15.905 --> 01:15:19.033
Umm... Lord Sesshomaru is still
up there...

01:15:19.542 --> 01:15:22.272
Damn him! Showing off
by himself!

01:15:22.345 --> 01:15:23.175
Wait!

01:15:23.913 --> 01:15:24.902
Don't stop me!

01:15:25.248 --> 01:15:28.240
I have to settle things
with Sounga!

01:15:28.318 --> 01:15:29.546
So listen to me!

01:15:29.619 --> 01:15:30.984
What is it?

01:15:31.054 --> 01:15:32.681
In order to destroy Sounga,

01:15:32.789 --> 01:15:37.658
Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga have to
combine forces and work together!

01:15:37.927 --> 01:15:38.916
<i>Exactly!</i>

01:15:39.229 --> 01:15:40.321
What?!

01:15:40.563 --> 01:15:44.499
<i>You must combine your Backlash Wave
with Sesshomaru's Dragon Strike,</i>

01:15:44.667 --> 01:15:47.693
<i>in order to defeat
Sounga's Dragon Twister.</i>

01:15:48.905 --> 01:15:52.739
Hah! No way will Sesshomaru
cooperate with me!

01:15:53.109 --> 01:15:53.871
Stupid!

01:15:54.077 --> 01:15:56.602
<i>You have to cooperate
with Sesshomaru!</i>

01:15:56.913 --> 01:15:58.380
I ain't gonna do that!

01:15:58.615 --> 01:16:00.344
There's no other way!

01:16:00.617 --> 01:16:03.711
You're brothers! Defer to him
just this once!

01:16:05.121 --> 01:16:06.053
Try it!

01:16:06.456 --> 01:16:08.083
You can do it, Inuyasha!

01:16:08.691 --> 01:16:10.852
You've managed every time
until now.

01:16:13.730 --> 01:16:15.994
Hah! Like it's so easy to do!

01:16:22.972 --> 01:16:23.870
<i>What's the matter?</i>

01:16:25.508 --> 01:16:27.135
The enchanted beads...

01:16:28.745 --> 01:16:31.543
<i>We're still connected, aren't we?</i>

01:16:34.751 --> 01:16:36.412
What's wrong, Sesshomaru?

01:16:37.887 --> 01:16:40.014
Your father's fang is crying!

01:16:46.429 --> 01:16:48.693
<i>Do you have someone
to protect?</i>

01:16:49.966 --> 01:16:50.898
Father...

01:17:09.385 --> 01:17:12.548
Your nose is sharp as ever.

01:17:13.156 --> 01:17:15.954
You picked up the scent
of my Wind Scar, huh?

01:17:16.292 --> 01:17:19.557
Your wind is no more than
a gentle breeze.

01:17:19.796 --> 01:17:23.425
Heh, I was hoping to take you
both out at the same time!

01:17:23.933 --> 01:17:27.232
Two brothers working together
to avenge their father, huh?

01:17:27.370 --> 01:17:30.396
So even demons have feelings?

01:17:30.607 --> 01:17:33.508
Who the hell are you to talk?!

01:17:35.578 --> 01:17:39.014
Looking at you reminds
me of lzayoi.

01:17:39.082 --> 01:17:39.707
Huh?!

01:17:39.782 --> 01:17:44.981
A foolish woman who abandoned me and
gave birth to a half breed like you...

01:17:45.622 --> 01:17:46.520
Why you

01:17:46.589 --> 01:17:48.181
Listen well, Inuyasha...

01:17:48.892 --> 01:17:53.261
I am the man who sent your mother
to the netherworld.

01:17:58.902 --> 01:17:59.732
Move!

01:18:00.136 --> 01:18:01.125
Get back!

01:18:01.204 --> 01:18:02.034
Shaddup!

01:18:02.105 --> 01:18:04.096
You're not going to one up
me this time!

01:18:04.274 --> 01:18:08.176
This is the perfect opportunity
to kill you both at the same time!

01:18:08.611 --> 01:18:11.273
<i>Takemaru, use the Dragon Twister.</i>

01:18:11.414 --> 01:18:13.905
<i>Destroy the Tetsusaiga
and Tenseiga.</i>

01:18:14.083 --> 01:18:16.574
I don't need you to
tell me that!

01:18:19.122 --> 01:18:20.487
Like I'd let you!

01:18:20.556 --> 01:18:22.387
You don't know when
to give up, do you?!

01:18:26.329 --> 01:18:28.957
I just don't like to give up!

01:18:32.101 --> 01:18:33.625
Huh?! Lmpossible...!

01:18:34.671 --> 01:18:38.607
<i>Why you!
You still have such power....</i>

01:18:39.075 --> 01:18:41.509
This is nothing to
be surprised about!

01:18:43.513 --> 01:18:45.811
It's inconceivable in a demon!

01:18:45.915 --> 01:18:48.816
Damn right! I'm a half demon!

01:18:49.519 --> 01:18:53.148
More egotistical and greedy
than any other living creature...

01:18:53.222 --> 01:18:54.814
That's a human being, right?

01:18:55.291 --> 01:18:57.521
Well, human blood flows through
my veins

01:18:57.593 --> 01:18:59.458
and that's why I just won't give up!

01:18:59.796 --> 01:19:00.728
On top of that...

01:19:00.797 --> 01:19:03.595
when a human has someone
he has to protect,

01:19:03.666 --> 01:19:06.328
his power increases multifold.

01:19:08.204 --> 01:19:10.172
That's why I'm able to destroy you now!

01:19:10.239 --> 01:19:12.707
I owe it to my mother!

01:19:14.177 --> 01:19:15.576
<i>Takemaru....</i>

01:19:17.380 --> 01:19:18.404
Izayoi...

01:19:30.626 --> 01:19:32.992
<i>Hurry and leave immediately.</i>

01:19:38.701 --> 01:19:42.193
<i>Hurry and leave with
the men outside.</i>

01:19:42.905 --> 01:19:45.931
Lady lzayoi...
You...

01:19:46.042 --> 01:19:49.307
<i>I do not want you to die.</i>

01:19:50.146 --> 01:19:52.239
You tried to protect me...

01:19:52.782 --> 01:19:56.343
<i>Takemaru.. ?
What's wrong, Takemaru?</i>

01:19:56.986 --> 01:19:58.214
I remember...

01:19:59.455 --> 01:20:03.619
I never resented Lady lzayoi.

01:20:04.360 --> 01:20:08.319
I always... loved... Lady lzayoi...

01:20:15.138 --> 01:20:16.332
It's over.

01:20:28.217 --> 01:20:30.777
Hah! I don't know what
you're up to,

01:20:30.853 --> 01:20:33.481
but I'm the one who beat him!

01:20:33.656 --> 01:20:35.453
It's not over yet.

01:20:35.658 --> 01:20:36.488
Huh?!

01:20:40.563 --> 01:20:41.860
Persistent bastard!

01:20:59.248 --> 01:21:03.150
<i>I shall open the path
to the underworld!</i>

01:21:29.078 --> 01:21:32.878
<i>Oh no! Sounga has opened
the gateway to Hell!</i>

01:21:32.949 --> 01:21:34.382
What happens when
it's open?

01:21:34.817 --> 01:21:37.945
The boundary between the
living and the dead disappears.

01:21:38.020 --> 01:21:40.250
We'll all end up dead.

01:21:40.556 --> 01:21:41.454
Oh no...!

01:21:41.524 --> 01:21:44.755
After all, it's the sword that
controls Hell.

01:21:45.294 --> 01:21:48.388
<i>While Tetsusaiga and Tenseiga
exchange blows,</i>

01:21:48.464 --> 01:21:52.230
<i>Sounga is trying to absorb
this world into Hell.</i>

01:21:53.769 --> 01:21:56.033
<i>Fool! Don't go near there!</i>

01:22:11.087 --> 01:22:12.349
What is that?!

01:22:12.755 --> 01:22:14.950
The dead of the underworld.

01:22:15.024 --> 01:22:18.551
<i>They're calling out to
the souls of the living.</i>

01:22:19.028 --> 01:22:23.124
<i>We must hurry and run away,
or your souls will be swallowed up!</i>

01:22:23.432 --> 01:22:25.730
But Inuyasha and Sesshomaru are still...

01:22:26.035 --> 01:22:27.229
<i>Here it comes!</i>

01:22:36.245 --> 01:22:37.906
They cause so much trouble!

01:22:39.182 --> 01:22:40.171
<i>What is this?</i>

01:22:40.383 --> 01:22:42.749
<i>This feeling deep in my heart?</i>

01:22:50.226 --> 01:22:52.990
Sango, you must be strong.

01:22:53.229 --> 01:22:55.094
Do not let your heart be
devoured by the darkness!

01:22:57.833 --> 01:23:00.495
<i>Everyone! Gather round me!</i>

01:23:07.743 --> 01:23:09.677
It's so cold, Master Jaken!

01:23:10.046 --> 01:23:12.344
Hey Saya! Can't you do something?!

01:23:12.748 --> 01:23:15.046
<i>With my power, this is the limit.</i>

01:23:15.117 --> 01:23:17.142
<i>But if you leave my barrier,</i>

01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:20.951
<i>all the humans will be taken
over by the dead.</i>

01:23:21.390 --> 01:23:25.986
No way! If anything happens to Rin,
I'll be killed by Lord Sesshomaru!

01:23:26.862 --> 01:23:28.659
Huh?! Lord Sesshomaru!

01:23:30.166 --> 01:23:30.962
Move!

01:23:32.101 --> 01:23:32.965
You're in my way!

01:23:36.138 --> 01:23:38.129
<i>You're such a disappointment.</i>

01:23:39.275 --> 01:23:42.073
A vulgar sword deserves
a cast off arm.

01:23:46.682 --> 01:23:50.015
<i>You can't wield the Sounga!</i>

01:23:50.186 --> 01:23:51.585
Move!

01:23:52.555 --> 01:23:54.989
I'll be the one to destroy you!

01:23:55.424 --> 01:23:56.391
<i>That won't work!</i>

01:23:56.459 --> 01:23:59.485
<i>You can't attack him separately!</i>

01:24:02.498 --> 01:24:03.624
Kagome! Where are you going?!

01:24:21.651 --> 01:24:22.583
Inuyasha!

01:24:23.185 --> 01:24:24.015
Kagome!

01:24:24.654 --> 01:24:27.350
Please fight together with Sesshomaru!

01:24:27.757 --> 01:24:29.657
No way!

01:24:29.925 --> 01:24:33.190
Sesshomaru! Please cooperate
with Inuyasha!

01:24:33.262 --> 01:24:33.990
What?!

01:24:34.063 --> 01:24:36.122
Are you listening, Sesshomaru?!

01:24:37.233 --> 01:24:39.030
Yes, Lord Sesshomaru!

01:24:39.168 --> 01:24:43.036
There's no need for you to ally
yourself with a half demon like Inuyasha!

01:24:47.943 --> 01:24:52.471
Lord Sesshomaru...
Please join forces with Inuyasha.

01:24:54.784 --> 01:24:55.876
Move!

01:24:56.852 --> 01:25:00.481
I give up on both of you nincompoops!

01:25:04.527 --> 01:25:05.221
Now!

01:25:05.995 --> 01:25:06.689
Why you!

01:25:09.465 --> 01:25:10.295
Kagome!

01:25:13.602 --> 01:25:14.569
Kagome!

01:25:20.042 --> 01:25:21.031
Hold this!

01:25:21.210 --> 01:25:23.201
Lt'll protect you for
a little while.

01:25:34.757 --> 01:25:35.883
W What's happening?!

01:25:36.292 --> 01:25:37.884
<i>The hole is expanding!</i>

01:25:37.960 --> 01:25:39.325
<i>It's dangerous here, too!</i>

01:25:39.729 --> 01:25:41.492
But Kagome and Inuyasha are...!

01:25:46.836 --> 01:25:48.201
It's useless...

01:25:49.905 --> 01:25:51.463
<i>Dragon Twister!</i>

01:25:53.476 --> 01:25:54.101
What?!

01:25:56.212 --> 01:25:56.940
Inuyasha!

01:25:58.114 --> 01:25:58.978
Inuyasha!

01:25:59.849 --> 01:26:00.645
Dammit!

01:26:06.122 --> 01:26:07.851
Backlash Wave!

01:26:11.794 --> 01:26:14.058
<i>You're not bad.
This is entertaining!</i>

01:26:14.163 --> 01:26:15.994
Damn! I missed!

01:26:17.233 --> 01:26:17.927
Inuyasha!

01:26:18.334 --> 01:26:20.768
Wait here!
I'll be back without fail!

01:26:22.104 --> 01:26:22.798
All right.

01:26:27.243 --> 01:26:29.336
<i>Kid, how's this?</i>

01:26:34.550 --> 01:26:35.915
Backlash Wave!

01:26:38.754 --> 01:26:40.051
My Backlash Wave isn't working!

01:26:45.394 --> 01:26:46.418
Inuyasha...!

01:26:50.199 --> 01:26:53.691
<i>Even Lord Sesshomaru is at
a disadvantage when empty handed.</i>

01:26:53.936 --> 01:26:56.632
Was that the limit of
Dragon Twister's power?

01:26:56.806 --> 01:26:59.775
<i>Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga
are nearby.</i>

01:26:59.842 --> 01:27:03.369
<i>So Sounga can't utilize
its full power.</i>

01:27:07.583 --> 01:27:08.572
Inuyasha!

01:27:15.057 --> 01:27:15.751
Take this!

01:27:16.258 --> 01:27:18.783
<i>I'll send you both to Hell!</i>

01:27:19.261 --> 01:27:20.353
You're in the way!

01:27:21.797 --> 01:27:22.889
Lord Sesshomaru!

01:27:26.368 --> 01:27:26.891
Ah!

01:27:37.112 --> 01:27:39.307
Lord Sesshomaru, you are safe!

01:27:39.582 --> 01:27:42.983
He protected himself at the last second
with Tenseiga's barrier.

01:27:43.052 --> 01:27:46.419
Hey Myoga, weren't you with Kagome?

01:27:48.290 --> 01:27:50.087
Err... Well...

01:27:50.292 --> 01:27:54.592
It seemed to me that
Sesshomaru also protected Inuyasha.

01:27:54.763 --> 01:27:55.422
Yes...

01:28:03.973 --> 01:28:05.668
I can't produce the Backlash Wave!

01:28:14.483 --> 01:28:15.575
Inuyasha!

01:28:24.793 --> 01:28:27.728
<i>Now do you realize how
weak you are, half demon?</i>

01:28:27.997 --> 01:28:31.023
<i>Sesshomaru! It is your turn next!</i>

01:28:33.202 --> 01:28:34.601
It ain't over yet!

01:28:37.640 --> 01:28:38.766
Like...

01:28:39.174 --> 01:28:40.266
I said...

01:28:41.010 --> 01:28:43.171
with human blood flowing
through my veins...

01:28:43.379 --> 01:28:45.540
I don't give up!

01:28:52.888 --> 01:28:55.880
<i>Then this time, I shall
deliver the final blow!</i>

01:28:55.991 --> 01:28:59.654
<i>Fall to Hell with the mortal girl!</i>

01:29:00.596 --> 01:29:01.722
Come at me!

01:29:01.797 --> 01:29:04.561
I'll counter your attack
with my Backlash Wave!

01:29:11.173 --> 01:29:12.538
<i>Dragon Twister!</i>

01:29:14.777 --> 01:29:18.213
Go! Backlash Wave!

01:29:21.650 --> 01:29:24.949
<i>Fool! As if you can win
with just the Tetsusaiga!</i>

01:29:25.187 --> 01:29:27.382
<i>Try as you may to stop me!</i>

01:29:27.456 --> 01:29:30.391
<i>But the world of mortals will
be swallowed up by the netherworld!</i>

01:29:31.327 --> 01:29:33.022
Shut your mouth!

01:29:35.497 --> 01:29:37.488
I have someone to protect!

01:29:39.902 --> 01:29:41.802
That's why I can't give up!

01:29:46.275 --> 01:29:47.435
Tenseiga?

01:29:48.477 --> 01:29:50.843
<i>Have you someone to protect?</i>

01:29:53.382 --> 01:29:54.371
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:29:54.516 --> 01:29:55.676
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:29:55.818 --> 01:29:57.046
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:29:57.186 --> 01:29:58.483
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:29:58.787 --> 01:29:59.879
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:30:00.055 --> 01:30:01.044
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:30:01.256 --> 01:30:02.348
<i>Lord Sesshomaru!</i>

01:30:03.325 --> 01:30:05.486
<i>Have you someone to protect?</i>

01:30:08.297 --> 01:30:09.696
Someone to protect?

01:30:17.072 --> 01:30:21.338
I, Sesshomaru,
have no one to protect!

01:30:24.413 --> 01:30:25.277
What?!

01:30:50.005 --> 01:30:50.699
Did we get him?!

01:30:59.415 --> 01:31:01.007
The cloud is being
swallowed up!

01:31:14.363 --> 01:31:15.193
Kagome!

01:31:21.637 --> 01:31:24.333
- Lord Sesshomaru!
- Lord Sesshomaru!

01:31:36.752 --> 01:31:38.344
Kagome! Inuyasha!

01:31:38.487 --> 01:31:39.749
You're both okay!

01:31:39.822 --> 01:31:41.187
'Course!

01:31:41.623 --> 01:31:43.022
Inuyasha, look!

01:31:45.360 --> 01:31:46.793
That's the Sounga!

01:32:10.119 --> 01:32:11.017
<i>Father....</i>

01:32:18.694 --> 01:32:20.059
- Master!
- Master!

01:32:21.029 --> 01:32:22.189
What! Father?

01:32:23.031 --> 01:32:23.929
Then that's?!

01:32:27.035 --> 01:32:29.936
<i>Sesshomaru.. . Inuyasha....</i>

01:32:30.906 --> 01:32:33.807
<i>You finally found the answer.</i>

01:32:34.143 --> 01:32:38.079
<i>With this, Sounga has been sealed
forever in the netherworld.</i>

01:32:38.447 --> 01:32:41.314
<i>There is nothing more
to say to you.</i>

01:32:43.118 --> 01:32:44.016
Old man!

01:32:48.557 --> 01:32:49.888
<i>Father....</i>

01:32:51.660 --> 01:32:57.121
The Master believed in his sons
and left everything in their hands.

01:32:57.332 --> 01:32:58.321
What do you mean?

01:32:58.400 --> 01:33:01.699
<i>The only chance to seal
Sounga, the sword of calamity,</i>

01:33:01.770 --> 01:33:06.639
<i>was the moment the gateway
to Hell opened.</i>

01:33:06.809 --> 01:33:08.276
And that only became possible

01:33:08.343 --> 01:33:12.939
when Tenseiga and Tetsusaiga
combined their powers.

01:33:13.282 --> 01:33:16.649
<i>The Master hoped that this
would happen.</i>

01:33:16.985 --> 01:33:19.886
Hah! The nerve of him!

01:33:20.956 --> 01:33:21.923
Ridiculous!

01:33:24.026 --> 01:33:27.518
- Wait, Lord Sesshomaru!
- Wait, Lord Sesshomaru!

01:33:29.131 --> 01:33:32.692
Saya! If you heard the Master's
last wishes,

01:33:32.768 --> 01:33:34.895
why didn't you speak up earlier?!

01:33:35.037 --> 01:33:38.097
<i>Well, I was just thinking
of those two....</i>

01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:40.067
Hah! I'll bet you forgot!

01:33:40.142 --> 01:33:41.166
<i>Well....</i>

01:33:41.643 --> 01:33:44.305
Such lovable old men.

01:33:47.015 --> 01:33:49.950
Your father seemed like a kind man.

01:33:50.519 --> 01:33:51.486
Think so?

01:33:51.787 --> 01:33:53.345
Are you happy you
got to meet him?

01:33:53.722 --> 01:33:54.654
Not really.

01:33:55.224 --> 01:33:58.660
Wasn't there something you
wanted to say to your father?

01:33:58.961 --> 01:34:00.690
Nope. Not at all.

01:34:02.397 --> 01:34:03.591
So proud!

01:34:03.999 --> 01:34:05.125
What?

01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.497
Oh, look, larks!

01:37:14.889 --> 01:37:16.379
Say Inuyasha...

01:37:16.724 --> 01:37:17.782
Huh?

01:37:18.325 --> 01:37:21.419
I thought that Sesshomaru
didn't like people,

01:37:21.495 --> 01:37:22.962
but maybe it's not so.

01:37:23.464 --> 01:37:24.988
I'm sure he hates them

01:37:25.533 --> 01:37:28.434
But Rin is by his side
all the time.

01:37:28.803 --> 01:37:30.430
Who cares about that?

01:37:30.871 --> 01:37:34.034
Oh yes! Inuyasha, sit up!
C'mon sit up!

01:37:34.141 --> 01:37:35.165
What?

01:37:35.943 --> 01:37:37.535
I have something nice for you.

01:37:38.479 --> 01:37:39.946
What a pain...

01:37:40.314 --> 01:37:42.680
Please, close your eyes.

01:37:43.384 --> 01:37:44.214
Geez...

01:37:47.621 --> 01:37:48.451
Okay, open.

01:37:49.089 --> 01:37:49.885
Huh?

01:37:50.758 --> 01:37:52.726
Arghh! What is this?

01:37:52.793 --> 01:37:54.522
Not the Beads of
Subjugation again!

01:37:55.262 --> 01:37:57.287
You said something nice!

01:37:57.364 --> 01:37:59.958
You were thinking of
something nasty!

01:38:00.267 --> 01:38:01.700
L Like what?!

01:38:01.769 --> 01:38:02.599
I knew it!

01:38:03.037 --> 01:38:07.201
I don't need this thing!
Don't you trust me?

01:38:07.441 --> 01:38:08.669
Sure I trust you.

01:38:08.943 --> 01:38:11.411
But I don't want you
going off alone again.

01:38:12.379 --> 01:38:15.246
I won't!
Hey! Take it off!

01:38:15.316 --> 01:38:16.146
Nope.

01:38:16.684 --> 01:38:18.117
Take it off!

01:38:18.185 --> 01:38:19.174
Sit boy.
