00:02.135 --> 00:03.796
Doctor is a prestigious occupation...

00:05.138 --> 00:06.867
...but it's one of the only jobs...

00:07.040 --> 00:10.009
...where you have to have your
diploma right up there on the wall.

00:10.176 --> 00:12.235
It makes them seem
so insecure, doesn't it?

00:12.412 --> 00:15.142
"I really am a doctor, you know.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.510
If you think I'm not,
just check it out."

00:19.819 --> 00:21.878
I don't know why they need
these little bits...

00:22.055 --> 00:23.682
...of psychological
leverage over us.

00:23.857 --> 00:26.417
"Go in that room, take your pants off,
wait 15 minutes...

00:26.593 --> 00:29.255
...then I'll give you my opinion."

00:29.963 --> 00:31.794
After that, anybody with pants on...

00:31.965 --> 00:34.229
...seems like they know
what they're talking about.

00:34.401 --> 00:38.360
In any difference of opinion,
pants always beats no pants.

00:44.477 --> 00:46.502
Can I say one word to you?

00:46.679 --> 00:48.169
Lobster.

00:48.348 --> 00:50.179
The lobster here is unbelievable.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.651
A little expensive.

00:55.121 --> 00:58.056
-Twenty-five dollars.
-Yes, well, you know...

00:58.224 --> 01:00.419
...I'm not thinking about the price.

01:00.593 --> 01:03.824
You know, you're the only woman
I've never thought about the price.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.658
Get the lobster. I beg you to get it.

01:05.832 --> 01:08.357
-Go for it. Go for the lobster.
-George...

01:08.535 --> 01:10.162
George...

01:10.336 --> 01:12.463
...I think we have to talk.

01:12.639 --> 01:14.539
I think we have a problem.

01:15.341 --> 01:16.740
We do?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.745
We can't keep seeing each other.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.407
Why?

01:22.949 --> 01:26.077
Because it's over.

01:27.620 --> 01:30.111
It's my parents, George.

01:30.290 --> 01:32.850
The differences in our religion...

01:34.461 --> 01:36.053
George...

01:36.229 --> 01:38.993
...can you ever forgive me?

01:39.766 --> 01:41.961
Have you decided yet?

01:42.502 --> 01:45.630
Yes. I'll have the lobster.

01:50.210 --> 01:54.704
You know, I'm starting to think that
maybe lobster isn't the way to go.

01:56.950 --> 02:00.215
-What? He asked you out?
-We started to talk, I told him I jog...

02:00.386 --> 02:03.514
...and he put his hand on my heart.
-On your heart?

02:03.790 --> 02:07.123
-Jerry, the man is a doctor.
-Doctor. He's a podiatrist.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.782
So? Same thing.

02:08.961 --> 02:12.261
Anyone can get into podiatry school.
George got into podiatry school.

02:12.532 --> 02:14.295
-Really?
-Sure.

02:14.834 --> 02:16.961
-Hello.
-Oh, hi.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.067
-Are you gonna be stopping by later?
-Yes, I'll be stopping.

02:20.240 --> 02:23.073
-Okay. I'll see you later.
-See you later.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.908
Well, we can't all be
dating podiatrists.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.318
-It's over.
-What?

02:35.488 --> 02:37.922
-How'd you get in?
-Kramer.

02:38.091 --> 02:40.559
-What's that?
-Lobster.

02:42.695 --> 02:44.993
Looks like a swan.

02:45.565 --> 02:48.557
-She says we can't go out anymore.
-Why?

02:48.735 --> 02:51.169
Because I'm not Latvian Orthodox.

02:52.138 --> 02:55.938
Her parents won't let her date
anyone who isn't Latvian Orthodox!

02:56.276 --> 02:58.710
Latvian Orthodox?

02:58.878 --> 03:00.641
It is lobster.

03:00.813 --> 03:03.611
She's limiting herself
to Latvian Orthodox?

03:03.783 --> 03:06.217
-That's too bad.
-I know.

03:06.419 --> 03:09.217
This was the only woman
I never lied to.

03:09.389 --> 03:11.550
Well, that's not entirely true.

03:11.724 --> 03:13.282
Oh, whatever.

03:14.427 --> 03:17.021
-This is delicious.
-Succulent.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.793
She knew I didn't have a job.
She knew I lived at home.

03:21.968 --> 03:24.095
Didn't seem to bother her.

03:24.270 --> 03:26.534
I think I could have married
this woman.

03:26.739 --> 03:28.570
Why don't you just ask her parents?

03:28.775 --> 03:31.903
I can't. I met them. They're devout.

03:32.078 --> 03:35.479
You know, in the cab
on the way over here, I...

03:35.648 --> 03:38.310
I actually thought about converting.

03:39.118 --> 03:42.918
-To Latvian Orthodox?
-Why not? What do I care?

03:45.091 --> 03:47.787
You know, it's not like
changing toothpaste.

03:48.027 --> 03:50.291
I think it would be romantic.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.623
-Really?
-Yeah. It's like Edward Vlll...

03:54.834 --> 03:58.531
...abdicating the throne
to marry Mrs. Simpson.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.233
Like King Edward.

04:02.108 --> 04:04.872
-Like King Edward, Jerry.
-Yeah, well...

04:05.044 --> 04:09.105
...King Edward didn't live in Queens
with Frank and Estelle Costanza.

04:09.849 --> 04:12.181
You know what?
I could probably do this.

04:12.352 --> 04:15.014
-What's the difference?
-George, I was just kidding around.

04:15.188 --> 04:17.553
I wouldn't even tell her.
I could surprise her.

04:17.724 --> 04:20.921
-George, I wasn't serious.
-How hard could it be?

04:21.094 --> 04:24.461
You make a little contribution,
you have a ceremony.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.259
I am gonna think about this.

04:27.433 --> 04:30.596
I am really gonna think about this.

04:32.171 --> 04:35.106
-I guess this one is my fault.
-Oh, yeah.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.416
That was nice. Have you always
been such a good kisser?

04:46.786 --> 04:48.879
I don't know. Not always.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.386
No?

04:50.556 --> 04:53.389
No, I... I had to work at it.

04:53.626 --> 04:57.357
As a kid, while kids were out playing,
I'd be in my room practicing kissing.

04:58.364 --> 05:00.093
It was worth it.

05:01.100 --> 05:04.228
I'll be right back.

05:08.341 --> 05:10.673
-Where are you going?
-To wash my hands.

05:10.843 --> 05:13.607
-They're sticky from the orange.
-Meet you back here?

05:13.780 --> 05:15.975
-Right there.
-Okay.

05:37.070 --> 05:39.038
<i>Fungicide?</i>

05:39.639 --> 05:41.300
<i>Fungus?</i>

05:44.577 --> 05:46.306
Fungicide.

05:48.381 --> 05:50.474
-I mean, what could she have?
-I don't know.

05:50.650 --> 05:52.948
-Fungus.
-Exactly.

05:54.387 --> 05:57.151
-So, what'd you say?
-I said I was coming down...

05:57.323 --> 05:59.348
...with the flu and I had to go home.

05:59.525 --> 06:01.993
What were you doing
opening her medicine cabinet?

06:02.161 --> 06:07.030
I didn't open it. It was open.
I just nudged it a little.

06:07.433 --> 06:09.993
-You were snooping.
-I was not snooping.

06:10.236 --> 06:13.069
I did not break the seal.
There was no breaking and entering.

06:13.239 --> 06:15.298
-I wouldn't do that.
-I would.

06:16.809 --> 06:18.640
I always open medicine cabinets.

06:18.978 --> 06:21.879
Well, I trust people not to do that.

06:22.048 --> 06:23.743
Big mistake.

06:26.119 --> 06:28.587
Why don't you ask
that doctor what it is.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.815
Now he's a doctor?
Before he was a podiatrist.

06:32.058 --> 06:35.516
But that's what podiatrists do.
They deal in fungus.

06:35.695 --> 06:39.256
They're knee-deep in fungus.
This guy knows fungus.

06:39.632 --> 06:42.499
I am not going to ask him
about funguses.

06:42.869 --> 06:44.393
Fungi.

06:46.139 --> 06:49.233
-What?
-Fungi.

06:54.447 --> 06:59.009
Why do you want to accept
the Latvian Orthodox faith?

07:01.421 --> 07:05.687
In this age of uncertainty
and confusion...

07:07.093 --> 07:11.393
...a man begins to ask himself
certain questions.

07:12.198 --> 07:16.498
How can one even begin
to put into words something so...

07:16.803 --> 07:18.668
Enigmatic?

07:19.205 --> 07:21.935
-Vast?
-No, not vast.

07:22.675 --> 07:26.372
Well, whatever it is,
basically you like the religion.

07:26.679 --> 07:29.239
-Yes.
-Is there one aspect of the faith...

07:29.415 --> 07:31.713
...you find particularly attractive?

07:34.020 --> 07:36.045
I think the hats.

07:39.559 --> 07:43.825
The hat conveys that solemn
religious look you want in a faith.

07:44.363 --> 07:45.489
Very pious.

07:46.065 --> 07:49.660
Are you familiar
with Orthodox theology?

07:50.703 --> 07:55.800
Well, perhaps not to the extent
that you are, but...

07:56.709 --> 07:58.973
But I know the basic plot, yeah.

08:00.012 --> 08:02.742
-Plot?
-Yes, you know, the flood...

08:02.915 --> 08:06.351
...and the lepers
and the commandments and all that.

08:06.519 --> 08:09.784
Well, it's obvious
you are sincere in your desire.

08:10.156 --> 08:13.990
Oh, yes, I am, Father.
Incredibly sincere.

08:14.160 --> 08:15.684
So...

08:15.862 --> 08:17.523
...am I in?

08:19.131 --> 08:22.692
The first step would be
to familiarize yourself...

08:22.869 --> 08:25.702
...with these texts.

08:27.974 --> 08:32.172
You see, Father, I'm incredibly
anxious to become a member.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.042
Don't you offer any kind
of an express conversion?

08:36.215 --> 08:37.943
A quick change?

08:38.417 --> 08:39.509
Yes?

08:40.453 --> 08:43.980
Oh, I'm sorry. Father, there's a man
waiting in the chapel.

08:44.155 --> 08:46.351
Well, you may attend to it, Sister.

08:46.592 --> 08:51.495
This is George Costanza.
He is interested in joining the Church.

08:51.898 --> 08:54.230
Are you? Well, that's wonderful.

08:54.400 --> 08:56.595
-Well, good luck to you.
-Thank you.

08:59.005 --> 09:00.939
Nice nun.

09:01.240 --> 09:04.107
No, no. Sister Roberta is not a nun.

09:04.310 --> 09:06.904
She is what we call a novice.

09:07.079 --> 09:10.207
She won't be taking her final vows
until next Thursday.

09:11.617 --> 09:13.209
May I help you?

09:13.386 --> 09:16.878
Yeah. I'm here to pick up my friend,
George Costanza.

09:17.423 --> 09:20.483
-Well, he's in with the Father.
-Oh, yeah.

09:21.127 --> 09:24.756
-I'm Sister Roberta.
-Oh, Kramer, yeah. It's a pleasure.

09:25.231 --> 09:26.892
Mine.

09:28.467 --> 09:32.335
I can't believe how easy it is.
I'm virtually Orthodox.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.668
All I have to do is read a few books,
memorize a few prayers...

09:35.841 --> 09:37.433
...and I'm in the club.

09:37.610 --> 09:40.340
-That's all there is to it?
-That's all there is to it.

09:40.513 --> 09:44.347
By Christmas Day,
I will be Brother Costanza.

09:44.617 --> 09:49.077
And what is Brother Costanza
planning on telling Mother Costanza?

09:51.657 --> 09:55.286
Brother Costanza will be taking
the vow of silence.

09:57.730 --> 09:59.163
-Hey.
-Hey.

09:59.465 --> 10:01.228
Oh, a Slinky.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.696
-Sister Roberta gave it to me.
-Why'd she give you that?

10:06.939 --> 10:08.338
Well, I think she liked me.

10:10.242 --> 10:13.439
-What do you mean, she liked you?
-Liked me.

10:13.846 --> 10:16.644
Kramer, they like everybody.
They're friendly people.

10:17.116 --> 10:19.550
I think I picked up on a vibe.

10:21.120 --> 10:24.351
-You picked up on a vibe from a nun.
-Yeah.

10:24.724 --> 10:27.192
Jerry, I'm telling you,
I have this power...

10:27.360 --> 10:29.658
...and I have no control over it.

10:30.129 --> 10:31.391
Yeah. All right.

10:31.897 --> 10:33.660
That's my phone.

10:36.335 --> 10:37.597
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

10:37.770 --> 10:40.261
Just wanted to stop by and see
how you were feeling.

10:40.439 --> 10:42.304
A little better.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.805
Okay. If you need anything,
let me know.

10:46.979 --> 10:48.310
-Okay. All right.
-Okay.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.005
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:52.451 --> 10:53.816
Story.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.986
She's subletting Carol's place
for a month.

10:57.223 --> 10:59.885
-Yeah. She likes you.
-Yeah. But there's a problem.

11:00.059 --> 11:03.028
I found a tube of a fungicide
in her medicine cabinet.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.524
-So?
-So I don't know why she's using it.

11:06.732 --> 11:09.895
How do you even know it's hers?
Maybe it belonged to Carol.

11:10.069 --> 11:12.264
-Did you see a name on the tube?
-I didn't look.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.236
Well, take a look.
It might not even belong to her.

11:15.408 --> 11:17.569
People always leave things
in medicine cabinets.

11:17.743 --> 11:19.540
I got this old bottle
of cough medicine.

11:19.845 --> 11:21.506
I still have Brylcreem.

11:33.392 --> 11:34.984
-Hi.
-Hi.

11:35.161 --> 11:37.755
-Could I use your bathroom?
-My bathroom?

11:40.466 --> 11:42.457
-You sure you don't mind?
-Oh, of course not.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.035
People ask me medical questions
all the time.

11:45.204 --> 11:48.002
Well, I mean, the question
isn't even for me, actually.

11:48.174 --> 11:50.472
-It's for a friend.
-Elaine, I'm used to it.

11:51.010 --> 11:53.501
-I'm a doctor.
-Well...

11:53.679 --> 11:54.907
...podiatrist.

11:59.685 --> 12:03.086
No, no. I'm just saying, you didn't
really go to medical school.

12:03.255 --> 12:04.745
You went to podiatry school...

12:04.924 --> 12:08.758
...which I'm sure is very grueling
in its own way.

12:08.928 --> 12:12.557
I went to podiatry school
because I like feet.

12:12.732 --> 12:15.530
I chose to work with feet.

12:16.135 --> 12:21.038
-I like feet too. I'm just saying...
-Saying what?

12:23.709 --> 12:27.008
-How you doing in there?
-Fine. All done.

12:27.179 --> 12:30.273
-Just looking for the soap.
-No soap?

12:30.449 --> 12:32.576
No, I don't see it.

12:35.554 --> 12:36.543
Here you go.

12:38.491 --> 12:41.085
George?
What are you doing in there?

12:41.293 --> 12:43.386
What? Nothing.

12:43.562 --> 12:46.554
-You've been in there an hour.
-You don't feel well?

12:46.732 --> 12:48.063
-I'm fine.
-I want to know...

12:48.234 --> 12:51.032
...what you're doing in there.
-Nothing.

12:51.203 --> 12:53.137
-George, open the door.
-No.

12:53.305 --> 12:55.102
-Georgie.
-No!

12:58.611 --> 13:00.135
-Hey.
-Good evening.

13:00.312 --> 13:01.779
I hope I'm not disturbing you...

13:01.947 --> 13:04.916
...but I found another toy
I thought you might like.

13:12.625 --> 13:16.186
Okay. Latvius was the son
of which apostle?

13:16.428 --> 13:18.919
And I'll need that
in the form of a question.

13:20.332 --> 13:24.428
I don't know. I can't believe
they're making me take this test.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.773
-Hey, did you talk to the doctor?
-No.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.944
All right, the next time you see him,
show him this.

13:33.245 --> 13:37.443
-You took her medicine.
-Well, not on purpose. I was...

13:37.616 --> 13:39.481
I was hoping there'd be
a name on the tube.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.951
-When are you seeing him again?
-I don't know. We got into this thing...

13:43.122 --> 13:45.852
...about how podiatrists
aren't real doctors.

13:46.025 --> 13:47.287
How could you say that?

13:49.094 --> 13:51.927
That's your fault.
You just got me thinking.

13:52.097 --> 13:53.894
I was merely speaking
extemporaneously.

13:54.066 --> 13:57.399
I've got nothing against the foot.
I'm pro-foot.

13:57.570 --> 13:59.128
Me too.

13:59.305 --> 14:03.105
-Do you think I should apologize?
-Yes. He's a doctor.

14:04.944 --> 14:06.605
Wait a second.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.349
-What are you doing?
-What does it look like I'm doing?

14:12.117 --> 14:13.641
"Matthew. Luke.

14:14.386 --> 14:15.785
Paul."

14:16.088 --> 14:19.023
What, you're cheating
on your conversion test?

14:21.460 --> 14:22.688
-I told you.
-What?

14:22.862 --> 14:24.454
-I told you she liked me.
-Who?

14:24.630 --> 14:26.120
-Sister Roberta.
-How do you know?

14:26.298 --> 14:28.391
She told me.
She said she's never had a man...

14:28.567 --> 14:30.660
...stir up all these feelings
inside of her.

14:30.836 --> 14:33.896
She's questioning her faith.
She's thinking of leaving the Church.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.969
All this power!

14:38.677 --> 14:40.804
Look what I'm doing.
I'm dangerous, Jerry.

14:40.980 --> 14:43.505
I'm very, very dangerous!

14:52.024 --> 14:55.050
I must say, George,
I was somewhat surprised...

14:55.227 --> 14:57.661
...at the results
of your conversion test.

14:58.464 --> 15:03.128
I don't recall having seen
such an impressive performance.

15:04.036 --> 15:08.097
You truly must be filled
with the spirit of the Lord.

15:08.440 --> 15:10.499
Oh, I'm full of it, Father.

15:13.112 --> 15:14.773
Yes? Yes?

15:16.415 --> 15:18.212
Yes, yes, I see.

15:18.384 --> 15:21.547
I'm sorry. Something has come up.

15:22.021 --> 15:24.046
Oh, sure. I understand.

15:26.158 --> 15:28.183
-Hey.
-Yeah.

15:30.729 --> 15:33.163
-You wanted to see me, Father?
-Yes.

15:33.332 --> 15:35.766
Please sit down.

15:37.202 --> 15:39.261
Sister Roberta came
to see me yesterday...

15:39.438 --> 15:42.430
I know what this is about, Father.
I didn't do anything.

15:42.608 --> 15:45.338
I just spoke to her innocently
for just a few minutes.

15:45.544 --> 15:47.375
It's just that I...

15:47.546 --> 15:49.309
I have this power.

15:50.683 --> 15:52.241
Yes.

15:55.087 --> 16:00.525
It is a Latvian word which means
"the lure of the animal."

16:01.593 --> 16:03.220
I don't understand.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.727
Women are drawn to you.

16:05.898 --> 16:09.163
They would give anything
to be possessed by you.

16:09.335 --> 16:11.735
Help me, Father. Help me!

16:11.904 --> 16:13.428
Yes, yes. I will help you.

16:13.605 --> 16:15.800
Now, listen very carefully.

16:16.008 --> 16:19.876
I want you to buy
10 cloves of garlic...

16:20.045 --> 16:22.639
...three quarts of vinegar...

16:22.815 --> 16:24.282
...6 ounces...

16:25.651 --> 16:29.382
What is that stench? I got it.

16:34.560 --> 16:36.551
-Hey.
-Hey, what the hell is going on?

16:36.729 --> 16:39.289
-It stinks. What are you doing?
-I've got the <i>kavorca.</i>

16:39.465 --> 16:42.457
-The <i>kavorca</i> ? What is that?
-The lure of the animal.

16:42.634 --> 16:45.194
-I'm dangerous.
-What is this thing around your neck?

16:45.371 --> 16:48.704
The priests, they're helping me.
I just bathed in vinegar.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.335
You know, you're funkifying
the whole building.

16:51.510 --> 16:54.445
Keep away, Jerry. Just keep away.

16:55.581 --> 16:57.549
Kramer! Kramer!

17:02.221 --> 17:03.586
George Costanza?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.018
Estelle's son?

17:05.457 --> 17:07.516
Latvian Orthodox?

17:07.693 --> 17:09.991
-Why are you doing this?
-For a woman.

17:10.162 --> 17:12.186
A woman?
What, are you out of your mind?

17:12.364 --> 17:15.663
Why can't you do anything
like a normal person?

17:15.834 --> 17:20.066
Wait. Is this the group that goes
around mutilating squirrels?

17:21.906 --> 17:23.396
No, it's a regular religion.

17:23.575 --> 17:26.544
I'm calling my lawyer. It might not be
too late to get out of this.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.805
-I don't want to get out of it!
-But, George...

17:28.981 --> 17:32.610
...you don't know what you're saying.
You're under their control.

17:32.785 --> 17:35.447
-What, they brainwashed you?
-No. No.

17:35.621 --> 17:38.522
You're not performing any rituals
in this house!

17:38.690 --> 17:41.056
Go back to the psychiatrist.
I beg you.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.854
And stay away from those squirrels.

17:47.266 --> 17:49.666
-Oh, hi.
-How you doing, Jerry?

17:49.868 --> 17:51.961
-Good. What's the matter?
-I'm tired.

17:52.137 --> 17:55.265
I hardly slept last night
with all the scratching.

17:55.507 --> 17:57.566
Bonkers was going crazy.

17:58.577 --> 18:00.408
-Bonkers?
-My cat.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.173
He's got this weird
sort of skin condition.

18:03.348 --> 18:05.816
It's some type of fungus.
I couldn't find his medicine.

18:05.984 --> 18:09.010
-Oh, it's your cat!
-What?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.220
Nothing.

18:16.695 --> 18:19.721
-Are you ready, my son?
-Yes, "faddah."

18:19.898 --> 18:22.059
-What did you say?
-What?

18:22.334 --> 18:23.995
I thought you said "faddah."

18:24.803 --> 18:27.135
I said "faddah." I...

18:27.306 --> 18:30.139
I meant "Father."
Just a little bit nervous.

18:30.642 --> 18:32.803
Of course.

18:42.721 --> 18:44.382
How you doing?

18:44.556 --> 18:46.547
Get away from me, you creep.

18:46.725 --> 18:49.023
Yes. Yes, it worked!

18:49.194 --> 18:52.186
Sister Roberta.
I still got time to catch her.

19:09.381 --> 19:10.643
I gotta get there.

19:25.430 --> 19:28.422
Congratulations, George.

19:28.867 --> 19:30.801
Welcome to the faith.

19:30.969 --> 19:35.099
Sister Roberta, would you please
offer the final benediction?

19:39.578 --> 19:41.341
I can't.

19:41.513 --> 19:44.539
I'm sorry.
It's a beautiful religion...

19:44.716 --> 19:46.240
...but I am not worthy of it.

19:47.352 --> 19:48.842
I've found something else.

19:53.358 --> 19:54.825
Him.

20:02.201 --> 20:06.968
You know, because I love the foot.
I'm a big fan of the foot.

20:07.139 --> 20:09.164
Well, it's my fault.
I got a little defensive.

20:09.341 --> 20:12.435
And that pinkie toe. Come on!

20:12.611 --> 20:15.409
How adorable is the pinkie toe?

20:15.581 --> 20:16.946
It's my favorite toe.

20:17.115 --> 20:19.481
Let's face it. You get a bunion,
where you going?

20:19.651 --> 20:23.883
-You're not going to the ear guy.
-No, you're not.

20:30.596 --> 20:33.463
Would you excuse me?
I'll be right back.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.493
-Where's the bathroom?
-It's right down here to the left.

20:38.337 --> 20:40.202
I will meet you right back here?

20:41.073 --> 20:44.839
Elaine, it's her cat.
Her cat has the fungus.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.375
So I need the tube back.

20:50.782 --> 20:52.306
<i>Fungicide?</i>

20:52.584 --> 20:54.313
<i>Fungus?</i>

20:57.122 --> 21:00.421
Something's wrong.
I don't feel the same lure.

21:01.360 --> 21:02.793
You don't?

21:02.961 --> 21:04.258
What have I..?

21:04.463 --> 21:07.364
I must return to the Church.

21:08.066 --> 21:10.591
By the way, you really need
to take a bath. You stink.

21:10.769 --> 21:13.101
Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

21:13.272 --> 21:15.035
Once you put medicine
in your cabinet...

21:15.207 --> 21:18.176
...you're never using it again.
Medicine you use is on the sink.

21:18.343 --> 21:22.040
It's not really a medicine cabinet.
It's really like an ointment museum.

21:22.214 --> 21:25.081
It's like, "Here's a salve from 1983...

21:25.284 --> 21:28.742
...some cream from the '70s."
But you want to keep it private.

21:28.920 --> 21:31.889
A medicine cabinet is a place
that reveals our weaknesses...

21:32.057 --> 21:35.049
...and can throw off the balance
between people that are going out.

21:35.227 --> 21:37.695
Somebody peeks in there,
"Oh, I see Mr. Perfect needs...

21:37.863 --> 21:39.956
...tough actin' Tinactin.

21:42.100 --> 21:46.730
Well, I guess I'll be calling the shots
in this relationship from now on."

21:56.148 --> 22:00.312
-You did that for me?
-Well, I didn't do it for my mother.

22:00.852 --> 22:03.320
-I'm really flattered.
-Yeah.

22:04.056 --> 22:07.822
But I just don't feel ready
to make a commitment yet.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.926
Maybe when I get back from Latvia.

22:13.932 --> 22:15.524
Latvia?

22:15.701 --> 22:18.864
Yes. I'm going to stay
with some relatives there for a year.

22:19.037 --> 22:20.834
Isn't it great?

22:22.441 --> 22:24.636
Enjoy. Enjoy.

22:25.410 --> 22:28.777
Oh, George. You are so sweet.

22:28.980 --> 22:30.311
Don't ever change.

22:34.353 --> 22:37.117
I'd like a doggy bag for this, please.
