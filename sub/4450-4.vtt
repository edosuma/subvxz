00:02.268 --> 00:03.035
(Jakes)
Previously on Graceland...

00:04.136 --> 00:05.637
If you don't do exactly
what he says,

00:05.670 --> 00:07.538
he's gonna use that
Juan Badillo tape against you.

00:07.538 --> 00:08.672
None of us want
an indictment.

00:08.672 --> 00:10.340
What's it gonna
cost me, boss?

00:10.373 --> 00:11.474
Ari Adamian--

00:11.508 --> 00:13.408
he's a lieutenant
in the Sarkissian family.

00:13.408 --> 00:15.244
The previous UC,
Colby Moore,

00:15.277 --> 00:17.278
spent the last week
establishing you with Ari,

00:17.311 --> 00:18.412
building an ID.

00:18.412 --> 00:20.213
Logan won't let me
put Ari away,

00:20.247 --> 00:21.481
so I'm gonna put him down.

00:21.515 --> 00:23.148
I quit the job to get away
from Ari.

00:23.182 --> 00:24.250
Let's get this guy.

00:24.283 --> 00:25.283
I need you.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.684
You can't keep ignoring me.

00:26.684 --> 00:28.685
Baby, I want to be
with you all the time,

00:28.685 --> 00:30.987
but if you father finds out,
I'm a dead man.

00:31.020 --> 00:32.255
What's with
all the muscle?

00:32.288 --> 00:34.489
Martun's daughter got herself
into a car accident.

00:34.523 --> 00:36.090
Layla?

00:36.123 --> 00:38.526
Somebody smashed into her car,
stole a bunch of her shit.

00:38.559 --> 00:42.027
He was wearing a mask.

00:42.027 --> 00:43.962
(Briggs)
Start to finish,
this takes 24 hours.

00:43.996 --> 00:45.129
How do you imagine
this ending?

00:45.162 --> 00:46.964
With Ari no longer a threat
to the living.

00:46.998 --> 00:48.698
I need a harder drink
for that.

00:48.698 --> 00:50.400
Yeah.

00:50.433 --> 00:52.034
Mm.

00:54.702 --> 00:56.703
[line trilling]

00:56.703 --> 00:57.671
(Briggs)
Yeah?

00:57.704 --> 01:00.373
Something bad
has happened, guy.

01:00.406 --> 01:03.475
I need you to come here.

01:13.315 --> 01:16.050
[knock at door]

01:20.452 --> 01:21.654
Hey.

01:21.687 --> 01:23.021
Did you bring it?

01:23.054 --> 01:27.391
- Yeah, right here.
- Come.

01:27.424 --> 01:29.025
(Paul)
You got some blood on you.

01:29.058 --> 01:30.726
I woke up
in my car like this.

01:30.959 --> 01:33.061
Oh, dude, you should never sleep
in your car.

01:33.061 --> 01:34.995
It's the quickest way to jack up
your lumbar, you know?

01:35.029 --> 01:37.730
[crowbar slams on table]
- You're a chiropractor now.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.432
Be serious.

01:39.464 --> 01:41.366
I need to know what happened
last night.

01:41.400 --> 01:44.268
Okay, I mean, like, what--
what happened to me?

01:44.302 --> 01:45.569
Hey, hey, hey.

01:45.602 --> 01:48.038
I don't give a flying shit
what happened to you, guy.

01:48.071 --> 01:49.171
- All right, all right.
- Huh?

01:49.204 --> 01:51.306
What happened
to my fingers, huh?

01:51.306 --> 01:53.174
You--you burned yourself?

01:53.174 --> 01:54.575
Are you an asshole?

01:54.608 --> 01:57.543
I don't know what happened,

01:57.577 --> 01:59.445
and I'm asking you!

01:59.478 --> 02:00.579
Okay, okay.

02:00.612 --> 02:03.480
Listen, Ari, w-w-we went out
for drinks, okay?

02:03.480 --> 02:05.949
And I left to--to go do laundry.
I told you, man.

02:05.949 --> 02:07.050
Bullshit, laundry.

02:07.083 --> 02:10.352
It was a 24-hour coin-op
in Studio City.

02:10.352 --> 02:13.020
Your call woke me up, man,
I came here to help you.

02:13.054 --> 02:14.387
That's why I'm here.

02:19.458 --> 02:20.458
[gun clicks]

02:20.458 --> 02:22.293
Hey, hey!

02:22.327 --> 02:24.461
Come on, man.
Ari...

02:24.494 --> 02:27.330
Why is my gun empty
of bullets, huh?

02:27.330 --> 02:28.563
[sighs]

02:28.597 --> 02:31.199
I take your gun.

02:31.199 --> 02:32.333
[gun clatters]

02:32.333 --> 02:34.467
If any shit happen today,

02:34.500 --> 02:36.336
I ain't gonna be the one
going down.

02:36.369 --> 02:41.172
How much did you have to drink
after I left?

02:41.205 --> 02:43.974
I don't know.

02:43.974 --> 02:45.442
Cheap Arak...

02:45.475 --> 02:47.543
There are holes
in my memory.

02:50.645 --> 02:52.579
These were in my pocket...

02:52.613 --> 02:54.348
mentholated cigarettes.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.949
They're for college kids
and your people.

02:57.983 --> 02:59.284
Right.

02:59.317 --> 03:01.452
Put that shit in a bag.

03:01.485 --> 03:05.488
Okay.

03:05.488 --> 03:08.956
Not your blood...

03:08.956 --> 03:12.359
certainly not your cigarettes.

03:12.359 --> 03:15.594
I don't know.

03:15.628 --> 03:17.429
You think maybe you made a new
friend last night or something?

03:17.462 --> 03:19.364
Yes.

03:19.364 --> 03:22.466
And I have a suspicion...

03:22.466 --> 03:24.133
he's in the trunk of my car.

03:24.166 --> 03:27.235
It wouldn't be
the first time.

03:28.637 --> 03:30.971
Oh, man.

03:30.971 --> 03:34.240
Uh, you have heard of Uber,
right, bro?

03:34.240 --> 03:36.508
I'm usually
an excellent drunk driver.

03:36.508 --> 03:39.477
You see,
the key is broke off.

03:39.510 --> 03:41.077
Hmm.

03:41.111 --> 03:42.245
Yeah, and you, uh--

03:42.278 --> 03:44.113
you think your, uh, new buddy
is still in there?

03:44.146 --> 03:46.581
Alive or dead.

03:46.614 --> 03:49.083
[cell phone vibrating]

03:49.117 --> 03:50.584
Mother--
Come on!

03:50.617 --> 03:54.086
[grunting]

04:01.257 --> 04:03.359
This shit isn't mine.

04:03.393 --> 04:05.227
Whoa. Huh.

04:05.227 --> 04:06.460
What's that?

04:06.494 --> 04:07.595
Looks like a receipt

04:07.628 --> 04:09.196
from some gas station up
in Sun Valley.

04:09.230 --> 04:11.231
You did have
a late night, homey--

04:11.264 --> 04:13.399
2:51 a.m.

04:15.133 --> 04:18.468
Take the pipe
out of the windscreen, guy.

04:21.003 --> 04:22.538
We're going
to Sun Valley.

04:22.571 --> 04:24.606
[grunts]

04:38.615 --> 04:40.617
In Armenia,
there is a saying--

04:40.650 --> 04:42.985
"The sun won't stay
behind the cloud forever."

04:43.018 --> 04:44.118
You know what that means?

04:44.118 --> 04:45.987
Yeah, it means the truth
will come out.

04:45.987 --> 04:48.221
That's right.
The truth will come out.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.123
We're here.

04:59.162 --> 05:02.998
[man singing
in foreign language]

05:02.998 --> 05:06.000
[music and engine stop]

05:08.868 --> 05:12.271
[car door closes]

05:12.304 --> 05:14.072
You drove all the way
out here last night.

05:14.105 --> 05:17.407
You must remember
something, man.

05:17.407 --> 05:19.408
[muttering]

05:19.408 --> 05:20.609
I don't know.

05:20.643 --> 05:23.144
All I know
is my fingers hurt.

05:23.144 --> 05:26.013
Well, uh, let's see
what you bought.

05:26.013 --> 05:28.081
Maybe it'll jog your memory.

05:30.582 --> 05:32.117
They better have
my cigarettes.

05:32.150 --> 05:34.418
I smoke any more menthols,
I'll turn into a frickin'--

05:34.418 --> 05:36.152
[gunshots]
- Shit.

05:36.186 --> 05:37.887
(Briggs)
Shit.

05:37.887 --> 05:40.122
(man)
I said I would kill you
if you came back here.

05:40.155 --> 05:42.023
Hey, nobody is gonna kill
anybody, okay?

05:42.023 --> 05:45.025
That's right!
We're all friends!

05:45.025 --> 05:46.493
Jesus.

05:46.526 --> 05:48.160
Asshole!

05:48.160 --> 05:50.029
Hey, Ari, I think now
is a good time

05:50.029 --> 05:51.129
for you to give me back
my gun.

05:51.162 --> 05:52.597
Yeah, no frickin' way.

05:54.298 --> 05:57.033
Okay, look, I'm--
I'm coming out.

05:57.033 --> 05:59.568
Don't shoot.

05:59.601 --> 06:01.303
Jesus Christ!
Hey, Scarface!

06:01.303 --> 06:02.636
Easy with
the trigger finger, okay?

06:02.870 --> 06:03.637
I got this.

06:03.871 --> 06:05.972
Brother,
I'm not armed, okay?

06:06.005 --> 06:08.107
I'm not armed.
Don't shoot me.

06:08.140 --> 06:11.342
I'll shoot you and your friend.
I'm not playing.

06:14.311 --> 06:17.313
[electronic music]

06:17.313 --> 06:24.051
â™ª

06:27.320 --> 06:29.221
I'm not armed, okay?
I'm not armed.

06:29.221 --> 06:30.522
Don't shoot me.

06:30.554 --> 06:34.591
I'll shoot you and your friend.
I'm not playing.

06:38.927 --> 06:41.095
You were flatlined
two weeks ago.

06:41.129 --> 06:42.429
Now you're going
to kick some ass.

06:42.429 --> 06:43.430
You're a maniac.

06:43.463 --> 06:45.030
Well, Briggs is bent over
on this thing,

06:45.064 --> 06:46.432
and if you really think
about it,

06:46.432 --> 06:48.566
that damn tape
was in my bag.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.968
It's not only
your fault, baby.

06:51.001 --> 06:52.870
And I'm not that ready.

06:52.903 --> 06:55.204
The side's still
a work in progress.

06:55.238 --> 06:59.341
Wow. And there is no shipment of
Oxy in that lockbox over there.

07:02.176 --> 07:03.877
I'm done with painkillers,
Charlie.

07:03.910 --> 07:05.477
I'm joking, Mike.

07:05.477 --> 07:07.613
Oh, yeah.
[chuckles]

07:07.613 --> 07:09.447
Just be careful.

07:09.480 --> 07:12.349
You were going to shoot
at Ari Adamian today.

07:12.349 --> 07:13.916
It's all part of the plan.

07:13.949 --> 07:17.585
If Briggs says he'll handle it,
he'll handle it.

07:17.585 --> 07:20.053
Okay.

07:20.053 --> 07:21.321
It's good.

07:21.321 --> 07:22.922
- Let me see.
- Hmm?

07:22.922 --> 07:24.290
Yeah.

07:24.323 --> 07:25.857
(Briggs)
Look, brother,
we can work this out.

07:25.891 --> 07:28.059
- Your friend attacked me.
- Bullshit! You're a liar!

07:28.093 --> 07:29.460
I'm not lying!

07:29.460 --> 07:31.127
You punched me in the face and
threatened to cut off my balls!

07:31.161 --> 07:33.062
Yeah, put your gun down,
or I cut off your balls.

07:33.062 --> 07:34.329
Ari, please!

07:34.329 --> 07:35.931
I'm not gonna cut off
his balls.

07:35.964 --> 07:37.899
That'd mean I'd have to touch
his frickin' balls.

07:37.932 --> 07:38.900
And he's obsessed.

07:38.933 --> 07:40.600
Look, nobody
wants to hurt anybody.

07:40.834 --> 07:41.835
Okay?

07:41.868 --> 07:44.036
Aah! You said nobody
was getting hurt.

07:44.069 --> 07:45.471
You really shouldn't have shot
at us, man.

07:45.503 --> 07:47.205
That's right. Let's teach
this white boy a lesson.

07:47.238 --> 07:49.139
(Briggs)
It's okay. Ari, look, school's
out of session, bro.

07:49.173 --> 07:51.141
I say we just get
the information we need

07:51.175 --> 07:52.809
- and get the hell out of here.
- Good idea.

07:52.809 --> 07:54.342
Security camera--
where is the footage, huh?

07:54.376 --> 07:56.478
Dude, it's just for show, man.
There's no tape around here.

07:56.511 --> 07:59.480
Bullshit, show me
the security camera footage.

07:59.513 --> 08:01.581
There's no tape in there.
It's just for show, man.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.948
There's no actual tape.

08:02.948 --> 08:04.216
What happened
last night, huh?

08:04.216 --> 08:05.817
He came in.
He was bloody as shit.

08:05.850 --> 08:07.318
He bought a couple gas cans,

08:07.351 --> 08:09.286
and then he went nuts
when we didn't have smokes.

08:09.319 --> 08:10.320
Dunston Reds?

08:10.353 --> 08:11.420
Yeah, I said
there are other brands.

08:11.453 --> 08:12.588
- Other brands are shit.
- I know!

08:12.822 --> 08:14.223
That's what you said
before you hit me!

08:14.223 --> 08:16.090
Look, man, we got
your smokes in this morning.

08:16.090 --> 08:19.393
Was anybody else with him?

08:19.393 --> 08:20.827
No, it was just him.

08:20.827 --> 08:22.895
Uh, but he did use
a girl's credit card,

08:22.929 --> 08:23.895
Layla or something.

08:23.929 --> 08:25.096
How do you know that name?

08:25.096 --> 08:27.064
How do you remember
that name, huh?

08:27.097 --> 08:29.165
You don't forget a guy
that uses a girl's credit card

08:29.199 --> 08:30.900
and punches you in the face.

08:30.934 --> 08:32.034
Hey, hey, hey!

08:32.067 --> 08:33.368
- I'll shoot you in the head.
- Ari!

08:33.402 --> 08:35.970
I'll frickin' blow a hole
in your face.

08:35.970 --> 08:38.104
Tell me what you know
about Layla Sarkissian.

08:38.104 --> 08:39.940
Ari, just take it easy, man.

08:39.973 --> 08:41.073
Hey, shut up.

08:41.106 --> 08:42.842
Go, watch the door,
I'll handle this.

08:42.875 --> 08:44.475
Shooting him in the head is
not going to help us find Layla!

08:44.509 --> 08:46.076
You wait for me!
Go watch the door!

08:46.109 --> 08:47.244
I'll handle this!

08:47.244 --> 08:49.212
(Ari)
Now, was she here?

08:49.245 --> 08:52.447
Hey, hey, hey, there's
a black SUV pulling in here.

08:52.480 --> 08:55.015
Holy shit.

08:55.049 --> 08:59.085
That's frickin'
Martun Sarkissian.

09:00.153 --> 09:03.788
Hello.
Is this Martun Sarkissian?

09:03.821 --> 09:05.389
Yes, you requested data

09:05.389 --> 09:08.225
on your daughter's
recent purchases--Layla.

09:08.258 --> 09:09.325
Uh-huh.

09:09.358 --> 09:13.461
We show one purchase
at Sun Valley Gas, 2:51 a.m.

09:13.494 --> 09:14.962
There's only one
in that location.

09:14.995 --> 09:17.264
[cell phone beeps]
- He hung up on you?

09:17.264 --> 09:18.397
You like
my white-people voice?

09:18.431 --> 09:20.132
- I do. That shit was awesome.
- Good, right?

09:20.132 --> 09:22.000
[laughs]

09:22.000 --> 09:23.134
Yo, hold on.

09:23.134 --> 09:25.336
- Ah, there he is.
- Yeah.

09:27.937 --> 09:29.905
Yo, send the text.

09:34.508 --> 09:37.777
(Ari)
This is my
frickin' property, guy.

09:40.279 --> 09:42.780
This shit isn't mine.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.283
What's that?

09:47.283 --> 09:48.417
Looks like a receipt

09:48.451 --> 09:50.285
from some gas station up
in Sun Valley.

09:54.021 --> 09:56.155
Martun Sarkissian...

09:56.155 --> 09:58.891
what the hell
is he doing here?

09:58.891 --> 10:01.125
Get up, guy.

10:01.158 --> 10:03.394
Okay, give me
that pack of Reds.

10:03.427 --> 10:06.062
Get your mop, start cleaning
all this stuff up.

10:06.096 --> 10:07.830
Do your frickin' job!

10:16.035 --> 10:18.536
Okay, look, sorry
for the headaches.

10:18.770 --> 10:21.205
You weren't here last night.
You didn't see anything.

10:21.238 --> 10:23.507
There's no security footage.
You don't know anything.

10:23.540 --> 10:27.009
Please don't make me
have to kill you, okay?

10:30.444 --> 10:33.380
My car got into a fight
with a pipe.

10:33.413 --> 10:35.814
What are you doing here?

10:35.848 --> 10:37.283
What are you doing here?

10:37.283 --> 10:39.751
Martun asked me to come.
What are you doing?

10:39.751 --> 10:42.286
Can we save the pissing contest
for another day?

10:42.286 --> 10:44.954
Layla didn't come home
last night.

10:44.987 --> 10:46.822
What do you mean
she didn't come home last night?

10:46.856 --> 10:48.957
Well, she's missing.

10:48.990 --> 10:50.224
Where is she?

10:50.257 --> 10:51.292
Missing!

10:51.292 --> 10:53.526
Missing--
it means we don't know.

10:53.760 --> 10:57.296
[speaking Armenian]

11:02.265 --> 11:03.800
Now, who is this, huh?

11:03.800 --> 11:05.434
I, um--I'm Paul.
I was--

11:05.467 --> 11:06.936
He's nothing.
He's nobody.

11:06.936 --> 11:09.504
[speaking Armenian]

11:11.305 --> 11:13.039
Get out of here, guy.

11:23.046 --> 11:25.247
- What?
- This worker is an idiot.

11:25.280 --> 11:27.915
He wasn't here last night.

11:27.949 --> 11:29.250
But we checked the records.

11:29.283 --> 11:31.785
She bought gasoline
and Dunston Menthols.

11:31.785 --> 11:34.053
She doesn't smoke.

11:34.053 --> 11:36.921
Ari, you smoke Dunston?

11:36.921 --> 11:38.056
I smoke Reds.

11:38.089 --> 11:39.990
Layla was
in a car accident, right?

11:40.023 --> 11:41.258
Guy, shut up.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.159
What? I'm just saying.
Somebody hit her, right?

11:43.159 --> 11:44.293
They did it intentionally.

11:44.293 --> 11:45.894
They robbed her.
Now she's missing.

11:45.927 --> 11:47.162
There's no way that
that's a coincidence.

11:47.195 --> 11:48.796
Can you put a muzzle
on your dog?

11:48.829 --> 11:50.797
That makes sense.
It could be the same guy.

11:50.797 --> 11:51.898
Then maybe he brought her
up here.

11:51.931 --> 11:52.932
That's enough!

11:52.932 --> 11:54.466
No one brought her here.

11:54.499 --> 11:56.801
When she was young,
we used to rent a cabin

11:56.801 --> 11:58.402
up in Maple Canyon.

11:58.436 --> 12:02.938
Caught trout and cook them
on the skewer.

12:02.972 --> 12:06.808
I just have a feeling
she's there somewhere.

12:06.808 --> 12:09.343
Ari, you follow us,

12:09.343 --> 12:11.477
just in case of trouble.

12:11.477 --> 12:14.946
Trouble?
From what if she's alone?

12:17.781 --> 12:19.283
I said maybe.

12:19.315 --> 12:22.384
Maybe your dog here
is a bloodhound...

12:22.417 --> 12:25.286
and she's together with a man
who smokes menthol.

12:25.319 --> 12:28.955
In any case,
if she's in trouble,

12:28.955 --> 12:31.190
someone will die today.

12:37.494 --> 12:40.096
What the hell did I do, guy?
What did I do?

12:40.129 --> 12:42.464
I don't think
you did anything.

13:02.810 --> 13:04.479
(Ari)
Goddamn bitch.

13:04.479 --> 13:08.148
This cabin, guy--
we used to go there to screw.

13:08.181 --> 13:09.248
She never told me

13:09.281 --> 13:11.716
she went there to fish for trout
with her father.

13:11.716 --> 13:13.084
When we get up there,
are we gonna find

13:13.118 --> 13:14.385
the dead body
of Layla Sarkissian?

13:14.385 --> 13:15.452
Jesus Christ.

13:15.486 --> 13:17.053
No, she's gonna be
snuggled up

13:17.086 --> 13:18.821
watching The Bachelorette
or some shit.

13:18.855 --> 13:20.188
Okay.

13:20.222 --> 13:22.890
I mean, look, dude, you woke up
covered in blood, Ari.

13:22.923 --> 13:24.325
Your gun
was out of bullets.

13:24.358 --> 13:27.327
I don't think The Bachelorette
is going to explain all of that.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.461
Jesus Christ,
I didn't kill her.

13:29.695 --> 13:31.896
I have no reason
to kill her, no motive.

13:31.929 --> 13:33.097
I mean,
she piss me off, yes.

13:33.131 --> 13:34.231
She push my buttons.

13:34.231 --> 13:36.166
Today she has us
driving all around--

13:36.199 --> 13:37.333
Martun up my ass.

13:37.366 --> 13:38.701
When I find her--

13:38.701 --> 13:40.902
Hey, Ari, Ari, let's
dial it back

13:40.935 --> 13:42.037
to the "no motive" version.

13:42.070 --> 13:44.104
I didn't kill her.

13:44.104 --> 13:46.039
I left the bar with her.

13:48.840 --> 13:51.376
So now you remember the bar--
Nancy's?

13:52.877 --> 13:54.911
I remember pieces.

13:58.380 --> 13:59.915
(Ari)
I drank.
I don't know how much.

13:59.948 --> 14:01.382
I couldn't see straight.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.785
But she sent me that text--
"I love you."

14:04.818 --> 14:06.986
I check my phone history.
I call her.

14:06.986 --> 14:08.920
She came to the bar...

14:08.953 --> 14:10.855
in a red dress.

14:10.889 --> 14:12.723
That, I remember.

14:12.723 --> 14:13.857
Who are you?

14:13.891 --> 14:15.258
[giggles]

14:15.258 --> 14:17.793
And there was something.

14:17.826 --> 14:20.128
She was like...

14:20.128 --> 14:22.263
a special kind of heaven--

14:22.263 --> 14:25.865
the kind reserved for little
dead babies and saints.

14:25.899 --> 14:27.666
And she whispered
in my ear...

14:27.699 --> 14:29.834
Do me in the desert.

14:31.968 --> 14:34.304
What am I supposed
to do, man?

14:37.739 --> 14:39.841
(Briggs)
"Do me in the desert"?

14:39.874 --> 14:41.341
What kind of freakin' shit
is that?

14:41.375 --> 14:42.743
That I'm supposed
to do her.

14:42.776 --> 14:45.344
She say
some dirty shit.

14:45.378 --> 14:48.747
She better be freakin' curled up
with a blanket

14:48.747 --> 14:50.214
or with that mystery guy,

14:50.247 --> 14:53.416
'cause ain't walking down
the aisle with that bitch.

15:07.392 --> 15:09.693
Hey, Ari, you and your guy--
you stay here.

15:09.726 --> 15:10.794
Keep your eyes open.

15:10.828 --> 15:12.895
You check that side.

15:15.430 --> 15:18.732
Layla?

15:18.766 --> 15:21.768
Layla!

15:21.768 --> 15:24.736
I got bad feelings, guy.

15:24.770 --> 15:26.105
I want to go home.

15:26.138 --> 15:29.006
Ah, it's gonna be
all right, bro.

15:29.040 --> 15:32.408
Hey, uh, what is it with you
and Martun's guy?

15:32.441 --> 15:34.276
Toros...Berbarian.

15:34.310 --> 15:35.844
Did you say "barbarian"?

15:35.877 --> 15:37.745
No, Ber--Berbarian.

15:37.779 --> 15:38.946
He's not a barbarian.

15:38.979 --> 15:41.114
He's more like
a sagging vagina.

15:41.147 --> 15:42.381
I don't like him.

15:42.415 --> 15:44.716
Yeah, I gathered.

15:44.749 --> 15:47.818
He's Martun's niece's husband.
[exhales deeply]

15:47.852 --> 15:49.420
He thinks he's next
in line, but...

15:49.420 --> 15:52.222
we're gonna see about that.

16:03.329 --> 16:06.297
[door closes]

16:06.331 --> 16:07.764
Any sign of her?

16:07.798 --> 16:09.733
I don't know you,
so shut up.

16:09.766 --> 16:12.168
Ari, I want you to call
your uncle,

16:12.168 --> 16:13.168
give him the details.

16:13.168 --> 16:15.403
I want everybody looking.

16:15.636 --> 16:16.871
Layla!

16:16.904 --> 16:18.872
(Toros)
Boss.

16:28.011 --> 16:30.045
- What?
- Footprints.

16:30.079 --> 16:31.714
And something was dragged.

16:31.747 --> 16:33.381
Shit.

16:39.051 --> 16:40.153
(Jakes)
This is nice.

16:40.186 --> 16:43.622
I feel like Baby Chocolate Jesus
in his manger.

16:43.655 --> 16:45.322
I feel like we should do this
more often.

16:45.356 --> 16:47.790
Shut up.

16:47.824 --> 16:50.059
Be real with me. Is it always
fried chicken with you,

16:50.093 --> 16:51.627
or can you throw in
a frickin' salad?

16:51.660 --> 16:54.061
Yo, it's not my fault
you're so predictable, man.

16:54.095 --> 16:56.663
And I happen to be a master
at RPS.

16:56.663 --> 16:59.165
Dude, wait.
No, stop doing that.

16:59.198 --> 17:01.033
You can't just go around
abbreviating shit.

17:01.066 --> 17:02.267
It's rock, paper,
scissors, son.

17:02.300 --> 17:06.036
See, you stay working out
your bis and tris.

17:06.069 --> 17:07.803
You got to do
some legs, man.

17:07.803 --> 17:08.804
[thud]
- Aah!

17:08.804 --> 17:10.206
Do not!

17:10.239 --> 17:12.274
- Sorry, bro.
- God damn it.

17:13.674 --> 17:15.809
We all know how
this is gonna end, right?

17:19.912 --> 17:22.180
Do you think anybody is gonna
realize those are monkey bones

17:22.213 --> 17:23.681
from the SC Med School?

17:23.714 --> 17:27.683
I'm pretty sure Martun
is not an anthropologist.

17:27.683 --> 17:30.652
It's nice.

17:30.685 --> 17:34.688
And, yeah, it's gonna end
with a bad man in a deep hole.

17:34.688 --> 17:35.956
It's funny.

17:35.956 --> 17:38.691
I always thought our job was
to put bad dudes behind bars,

17:38.691 --> 17:40.292
not in the ground.

17:40.325 --> 17:41.793
If this thing goes right,

17:41.826 --> 17:44.361
it'll be a Sarkissian thing,
not ours.

17:44.395 --> 17:48.197
We're just providing
the bullets.

17:48.230 --> 17:50.732
And didn't you
just kill a guy?

17:50.765 --> 17:51.799
Wow.

17:51.799 --> 17:54.034
Dude, you serious right now?

17:54.067 --> 17:56.336
Did I want that?
No.

17:56.336 --> 17:59.938
Did I set the plan in motion
like Briggs is doing? No.

18:01.372 --> 18:04.975
You know, one could argue
Logan set this into motion.

18:04.975 --> 18:08.977
He put Briggs in a corner.

18:08.977 --> 18:10.945
This is what happens.

18:10.978 --> 18:14.214
And I would argue
that Ari set this into motion.

18:19.984 --> 18:21.219
Are you gonna toss that in?

18:21.252 --> 18:23.787
Nah.

18:23.820 --> 18:27.790
Got to give the man
a hint of a conscience.

18:31.692 --> 18:35.628
I'm just saying...

18:35.661 --> 18:38.029
it sure will be nice to feel
like one of the good guys again.

18:38.063 --> 18:40.664
Hmm.

18:40.698 --> 18:44.234
This might not be the best way
to get justice,

18:44.267 --> 18:46.602
but these are the cards
we've been dealt, man.

18:50.104 --> 18:53.206
I think we all can agree.

18:53.240 --> 18:56.842
Ari Adamian...

18:56.875 --> 18:59.677
has got to go.

19:20.657 --> 19:23.626
[breathing heavily]

19:29.596 --> 19:31.565
My Layla.

19:31.598 --> 19:34.566
Layla.

19:34.599 --> 19:36.234
(Ari)
You don't know it's her.

19:36.268 --> 19:39.270
[sobbing]

19:40.637 --> 19:43.705
Here...

19:43.739 --> 19:48.576
It's the ring
that I gave her when...

19:48.609 --> 19:50.877
she was 11 years old.

19:55.980 --> 19:59.683
Layla.

19:59.716 --> 20:03.219
[retches]

20:03.252 --> 20:05.587
Aah!

20:05.620 --> 20:08.889
[sobbing]

20:15.860 --> 20:19.229
(Toros)
Hey, I got something here.

20:19.262 --> 20:21.130
He smoked a cigarette
and sat right here.

20:21.163 --> 20:23.865
Hey, that looks like one
of the menthols

20:23.898 --> 20:25.633
from the gas station,
you know?

20:25.633 --> 20:27.868
And check out this match.
Look how far down it's burned.

20:27.901 --> 20:30.002
It's, like, burned
all the way to the end.

20:30.036 --> 20:31.170
This guy hesitated.

20:31.170 --> 20:32.904
Whoever he was,
he didn't feel good

20:32.937 --> 20:34.973
- about burning Layla's body.
- Can you shut up?

20:35.006 --> 20:37.107
Aah! God!

20:37.875 --> 20:39.108
Shithead!

20:39.142 --> 20:40.809
Shut up.

20:40.842 --> 20:43.844
Don't take her name
ever in your mouth again.

20:43.878 --> 20:45.246
- Okay, okay.
- You even think her name,

20:45.279 --> 20:48.014
and you will die
right here, right now.

20:48.048 --> 20:50.015
All right, listen to me.
Listen to me.

20:50.049 --> 20:51.784
I-I should not
have spoken her name.

20:51.817 --> 20:52.984
Didn't mean any disrespect.

20:53.017 --> 20:54.185
I don't give a shit
what you mean.

20:54.185 --> 20:55.619
I just want to hurt you.

20:55.652 --> 20:57.287
(Toros)
Martun, you want
to open him up, do it.

20:57.321 --> 20:58.921
I'll bury him in the woods.
No one will find him.

20:58.921 --> 21:00.122
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

21:00.156 --> 21:02.023
I'm not the guy
that you need to hurt.

21:02.057 --> 21:06.160
Ah, he's not the guy
I need to hurt.

21:06.193 --> 21:07.727
Then who is?

21:07.760 --> 21:09.228
- Who is?
- I don't know.

21:09.262 --> 21:10.729
Who is?

21:10.762 --> 21:12.630
I don't--I don't know.

21:12.630 --> 21:15.032
But I've been right
all day.

21:15.032 --> 21:17.634
Why don't you just let me
help you find him, huh?

21:17.634 --> 21:19.735
Let me help you.

21:19.768 --> 21:21.969
[chuckles]

21:28.574 --> 21:30.909
Aah!

21:35.578 --> 21:38.780
(Martun)
We got to find
this menthol-smoking man.

21:38.814 --> 21:40.615
We got to find him.

21:40.649 --> 21:43.751
We got back to the city.
Come on.

21:48.887 --> 21:49.888
[spits]

21:52.190 --> 21:54.524
Aha.

21:54.524 --> 21:58.160
What "aha"?

21:59.794 --> 22:01.995
Aha.

22:03.197 --> 22:05.565
A motel key.

22:13.203 --> 22:15.538
Martun, we should call our guy
in the Department.

22:15.538 --> 22:16.672
What guy in the Department?

22:16.705 --> 22:18.540
We keep this in the family,
in our family.

22:18.540 --> 22:21.075
When we find...

22:21.075 --> 22:24.211
the guy who did this...

22:24.211 --> 22:26.946
and I don't care how the hell
we find this guy,

22:26.946 --> 22:30.814
as long as we find this guy.

22:30.814 --> 22:32.082
[spits]

22:32.082 --> 22:34.684
In the old country,

22:34.717 --> 22:38.086
there are certain ways
of killing, huh?

22:38.086 --> 22:41.055
And I would like to teach
this man something new...

22:41.088 --> 22:44.524
yeah, when we meet...

22:44.557 --> 22:47.692
something
he will never forget.

22:53.562 --> 22:55.831
[spits]

22:55.831 --> 22:58.633
Jesus.

23:00.834 --> 23:03.936
You could have said my name,
but you didn't.

23:03.970 --> 23:06.905
Of course not.

23:08.839 --> 23:11.574
So do you have any idea
what door this opens?

23:14.576 --> 23:17.645
"Do me in the desert."

23:25.083 --> 23:29.186
Goddamn Nancy's Bar...

23:29.219 --> 23:31.554
you never should have
brought me there, guy.

23:31.554 --> 23:34.256
12. This is a much your fault
as anyone's.

23:34.489 --> 23:36.224
Ari, if I had known anything
like this was gonna happen,

23:36.258 --> 23:38.259
I never would've left
you alone.

23:38.492 --> 23:40.960
Bad luck.

23:40.994 --> 23:42.594
Yeah, well...

23:42.594 --> 23:44.263
I burn, you burn.

23:44.496 --> 23:46.097
Remember that.

23:48.865 --> 23:50.200
Oh, shit.

23:53.035 --> 23:56.671
So what's next
for you, huh?

23:56.704 --> 23:59.072
What's next?
What's next with what?

23:59.106 --> 24:01.841
Tomorrow when we wrap up
this Ari Adamian business,

24:01.841 --> 24:03.108
what's next for you?

24:03.108 --> 24:06.210
That's the million-dollar
question, isn't it?

24:06.243 --> 24:10.113
I'm looking for a new case,
but nothing's really sticking.

24:10.113 --> 24:11.980
Nothing big enough
to put your name in lights.

24:12.014 --> 24:13.782
It's not like that.

24:13.816 --> 24:15.850
I'd settle for an hour of sleep
right now.

24:15.883 --> 24:20.019
You know, that's exactly
what I'm looking for...

24:20.052 --> 24:21.821
something to keep me up.

24:21.854 --> 24:24.489
I mean, there are cases
out there, but...

24:24.522 --> 24:27.591
I want to find
the right one, you know.

24:27.624 --> 24:29.592
One that speaks to me.

24:29.592 --> 24:30.793
Oh, yeah?

24:30.827 --> 24:33.662
What language would it have
to speak to you in, Mikey?

24:33.695 --> 24:35.463
Truthfully...
[chuckles]

24:35.496 --> 24:37.597
I'm not sure.

24:37.597 --> 24:39.732
Does this have something to do
with counting chickens

24:39.766 --> 24:42.734
and, uh, your dream journal
and shit?

24:42.768 --> 24:47.003
Come on, Mike, you know there
are no secrets in Graceland.

24:47.003 --> 24:49.472
It's nothing.

24:49.472 --> 24:51.840
Doesn't sound
like nothing.

24:51.873 --> 24:55.075
It's--it's like um...

24:56.877 --> 24:59.512
It's like a phantom limb,
you know.

24:59.512 --> 25:01.746
It's like you can feel it
itching, but it's not there.

25:01.746 --> 25:02.881
And then once you feel it,

25:02.881 --> 25:04.582
it's the only thing
you can think about.

25:04.615 --> 25:06.950
And then one day
you wake up...

25:09.618 --> 25:11.487
And it's gone.

25:11.487 --> 25:12.887
No more itch.

25:12.887 --> 25:14.754
Okay.

25:19.592 --> 25:20.959
Well...

25:20.992 --> 25:22.994
when you're done
with your little dream quest

25:23.027 --> 25:25.128
and ready to join us back
in Sanity Land,

25:25.162 --> 25:28.464
I'm gonna need a hand
on this "pillbilly" deal.

25:28.498 --> 25:29.731
At some point,
I got to introduce

25:29.764 --> 25:30.999
my West Coast money guy.

25:31.032 --> 25:32.833
Dream quest or not,

25:32.867 --> 25:36.569
you know anytime you need help,
I got you.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.003
Thanks, Mike.

25:38.003 --> 25:40.771
Anytime.
[exhales deeply]

25:56.082 --> 25:57.916
Oh, shit.

26:06.989 --> 26:09.557
[breathing heavily]
Oh, shit.

26:10.057 --> 26:10.858
This is just reckless, man.

26:10.892 --> 26:13.093
If you would've done this,

26:13.159 --> 26:16.495
you would've done it clean,
you know, like Windex--

26:16.529 --> 26:18.763
no residue, no trace.

26:18.796 --> 26:20.931
I mean...

26:20.964 --> 26:22.699
(Ari)
It's a goddamn mess.

26:22.766 --> 26:25.001
Yeah, somebody's messing
with you, dog.

26:25.067 --> 26:28.937
There is no world in which
you murdered Layla Sarkissian.

26:28.970 --> 26:31.605
[breathing heavily]

26:31.672 --> 26:34.440
I need your help.

26:34.507 --> 26:38.209
Can you help me
clean this up?

26:38.442 --> 26:39.644
Yeah.

27:06.695 --> 27:08.696
Now let's hit
this mattress, dog.

27:08.729 --> 27:10.964
Come on.

27:10.997 --> 27:12.965
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, Jesus.

27:12.998 --> 27:14.867
This is stupid, man.
This is stupid.

27:14.934 --> 27:16.134
- Put it down.
- We can switch it out.

27:16.401 --> 27:17.902
No, just put it down.
Put the mattress down.

27:17.936 --> 27:20.804
- Ari, there's still time, man.
- Forget it. This is stupid.

27:20.837 --> 27:22.505
I'll be back.
Stay here.

27:22.538 --> 27:24.073
- Where are you going?
[door closes]

27:37.815 --> 27:39.583
Shit! [crowbar clangs]

27:42.551 --> 27:45.620
- I told you, forget that shit.
- Ari, listen, listen, man.

27:45.687 --> 27:47.888
This is not the way. We should
really give this some thought.

27:47.955 --> 27:49.423
I have thought about it.

27:49.456 --> 27:50.656
So what are you gonna--

27:50.690 --> 27:52.058
you're gonna light up
a whole motel?

27:52.091 --> 27:53.892
The police are gonna track
the key here.

27:53.959 --> 27:56.093
They're gonna come
with their ultraviolet light,

27:56.126 --> 27:58.562
shine at all
these little hairs and semens

27:58.596 --> 28:00.029
and fingerprints
and everything.

28:00.096 --> 28:02.764
Even if we pull the carpet out,
I'm everywhere.

28:02.831 --> 28:04.799
So, uh...

28:04.832 --> 28:06.767
So we get out.
Come on, move. Let's go.

28:06.834 --> 28:09.069
All right.

28:10.703 --> 28:12.938
You're the boss.

28:19.042 --> 28:22.477
You've been very loyal, guy.

28:22.544 --> 28:26.480
If we make it through this,
I won't forget that.

28:26.547 --> 28:28.848
I appreciate you.

28:28.881 --> 28:31.883
Hey, uh, Ari,
are you sure about this, man?

28:31.950 --> 28:34.619
I mean, you're gonna light up
a whole motel.

28:34.685 --> 28:36.653
This place got to burn.

28:36.720 --> 28:39.822
I just wish I knew what the hell
happened last night.

28:39.855 --> 28:41.657
Yeah, well...

28:44.559 --> 28:47.761
[sniffs]

28:47.828 --> 28:49.662
Ari.

28:52.998 --> 28:54.832
Hey, man,
we don't really have time to--

28:54.865 --> 28:57.533
We shouldn't be
standing around...

28:57.567 --> 28:58.901
gasoline.

29:05.106 --> 29:09.041
Hey, hey, come on, man.
The ashtray is there...

29:09.108 --> 29:10.643
[exhales sharply]
For a reason.

29:10.709 --> 29:13.011
Jesus.

29:13.044 --> 29:15.879
I will kill you.

29:17.713 --> 29:19.648
I'm sure you could.

29:19.714 --> 29:21.383
Another drink, sir?

29:21.449 --> 29:22.750
Yeah.

29:22.783 --> 29:25.518
Yeah!

29:25.585 --> 29:27.120
Ah!

29:27.153 --> 29:31.023
[grunting]

29:31.089 --> 29:32.823
You are a devil.

29:32.857 --> 29:34.491
I can tell you...

29:34.557 --> 29:37.393
from a thousand miles away.

29:40.962 --> 29:43.397
Cheers.

29:43.463 --> 29:46.499
You are a devil.

29:53.904 --> 29:56.639
Ari, I came for you.

29:59.007 --> 30:01.409
Who are you?

30:01.475 --> 30:04.978
Layla.
[giggles]

30:05.011 --> 30:07.880
Layla.

30:07.913 --> 30:10.114
We should be together.

30:10.348 --> 30:11.782
No, no, no.

30:11.848 --> 30:14.550
Your father will kill me.

30:14.617 --> 30:16.452
My father is not here.

30:16.485 --> 30:17.719
I am.

30:17.752 --> 30:19.954
Ah.

30:20.021 --> 30:22.856
I'm drunk.

30:22.890 --> 30:24.390
I don't mind.

30:24.457 --> 30:26.124
[moans]

30:26.358 --> 30:28.759
Do me in the desert.

30:28.793 --> 30:30.761
Oh, yeah.

30:30.795 --> 30:33.129
Let's do it.

30:35.831 --> 30:38.700
All right,
where are your keys?

30:40.434 --> 30:41.501
Come on.

30:41.535 --> 30:44.503
I drive.
I am a man.

30:44.537 --> 30:46.438
- Huh?
- I am a man.

30:46.504 --> 30:48.106
Yeah?

30:49.773 --> 30:51.508
God damn it.

30:51.542 --> 30:53.710
Okay.

30:56.044 --> 30:58.579
Am I interrupting
something?

30:58.646 --> 31:00.014
He's out.

31:00.047 --> 31:02.482
- Here's the ring.
- Perfect.

31:02.515 --> 31:04.016
I got to meet
the Mexican in ten.

31:04.049 --> 31:05.984
Okay, here's the credit card.

31:06.051 --> 31:08.519
Help me get him in
and then grab his shoes.

31:08.586 --> 31:10.587
- You're an asshole.
- Yes, he is.

31:10.620 --> 31:12.521
Aah!

31:20.060 --> 31:21.994
How did it go?

31:22.061 --> 31:23.496
I mean, I wish
I didn't have to deal

31:23.528 --> 31:25.630
with him pawing at me
all night, but...

31:25.664 --> 31:27.398
it's fine.

31:28.532 --> 31:29.632
Looks like
he's out pretty good.

31:29.666 --> 31:30.700
Yeah.

31:30.767 --> 31:32.001
The amount
of GHB we gave him,

31:32.068 --> 31:33.569
he should be out
for six hours easy.

31:33.635 --> 31:36.037
(Charlie)
Nothing easy
about the next six hours.

31:36.070 --> 31:38.805
- Undress.
- [sighs]

31:46.511 --> 31:49.645
[engine turning over]

32:15.496 --> 32:17.464
- Got him?
- Yeah.

32:17.531 --> 32:19.465
[Jakes grunts]

32:19.532 --> 32:21.833
One, two, three.

32:48.284 --> 32:49.585
(Charlie)
Can we go home now, man?

32:49.652 --> 32:50.752
(Jakes)
Word up.

32:50.819 --> 32:53.287
(Paige)
Hey, who has the matches?

32:53.320 --> 32:55.989
We, uh--we good?
Can we, uh...?

32:56.055 --> 32:57.857
Almost.

33:16.302 --> 33:18.738
(Briggs)
Brother, this don't look good.

33:18.771 --> 33:21.772
[groaning]

33:28.277 --> 33:29.378
What?

33:29.444 --> 33:32.480
[phone dialing]

33:32.547 --> 33:35.682
[speaking Armenian]

33:53.593 --> 33:54.894
- Hey, hey, hey.
- Go inside, man.

33:54.961 --> 33:55.929
What, what, what?

33:55.962 --> 33:57.362
We're going back inside.
Come on.

33:57.429 --> 33:58.630
- Back inside for what?
- Go back inside.

33:58.697 --> 33:59.797
Come on.

33:59.864 --> 34:00.932
Wow.

34:00.998 --> 34:03.266
You--you said--you just said
you trusted me.

34:03.333 --> 34:04.401
Yes.

34:04.467 --> 34:06.468
New information, guy...

34:06.502 --> 34:08.837
and new beliefs.

34:08.870 --> 34:10.438
Jesus.

34:31.351 --> 34:31.985
They've been in there
for over an hour.

34:33.453 --> 34:34.820
I don't know what the hell
is going on.

34:34.820 --> 34:36.322
You have eyes
on the place.

34:36.322 --> 34:37.856
You haven't heard
any gunfire, right?

34:37.856 --> 34:40.591
No, but I'm--I'm gonna get
a closer look.

34:40.591 --> 34:42.825
- Don't get anxious.
- I am anxious, Dale.

34:42.825 --> 34:45.560
They've been in there forever,
and now it's just silent.

34:47.462 --> 34:49.597
- So you're waiting on a--
- Shut up, guy.

34:49.597 --> 34:52.365
[cell phone ringing]

34:52.365 --> 34:55.434
[speaking Armenian]

35:01.371 --> 35:03.272
Let's go.
We're taking another trip.

35:03.272 --> 35:04.974
Come on.

35:06.875 --> 35:09.009
(Dale on phone)
Charlie, you still there?

35:09.009 --> 35:11.344
(Charlie)
Hang on, Jakes.
They're leaving the motel.

35:15.447 --> 35:17.615
Shit, Ari just pulled a gun
on Paul.

35:17.615 --> 35:18.883
They're getting
into his car.

35:18.883 --> 35:20.750
Charlie, call backup.

35:20.750 --> 35:23.018
Shit. Shit.

35:23.018 --> 35:24.019
Charlie?

35:24.019 --> 35:26.487
[tires squealing]
- Paul!

35:32.358 --> 35:33.626
Shit.

35:33.626 --> 35:34.792
Shit!

35:34.792 --> 35:37.361
I had a gut feeling
about today...

35:37.361 --> 35:41.764
that someone very clever
was pulling the strings on me.

35:41.764 --> 35:44.366
And I'm standing there

35:44.366 --> 35:47.568
about to set
the Sahara Motel on flame,

35:47.568 --> 35:50.703
and I'm watching the match
burn down,

35:50.703 --> 35:52.871
about to burn
my fingers again,

35:52.871 --> 35:54.672
and I realize...

35:59.476 --> 36:02.011
They're the wrong fingertips.

36:02.011 --> 36:04.512
I've always been a lucky man.

36:04.512 --> 36:05.947
Gipsy woman once told me--

36:05.947 --> 36:07.781
something to do
with my stars.

36:07.781 --> 36:08.849
[groans]

36:08.849 --> 36:11.584
Today my stars are in line.

36:11.584 --> 36:13.752
I light it
with my left hand.

36:13.752 --> 36:17.388
So, if I'm sitting there
about to burn Layla's body,

36:17.388 --> 36:19.789
I ain't go use these...

36:19.789 --> 36:21.390
the right fingers.

36:21.390 --> 36:23.524
But then I'm thinking, guy.

36:25.326 --> 36:28.528
There's only one man
in the entire world,

36:28.528 --> 36:32.931
one man who knew enough
to make all this shit up.

36:34.599 --> 36:35.933
So I call Martun.

36:35.933 --> 36:38.668
He pulls a favor,
run some plates,

36:38.668 --> 36:41.236
and now we find him here.

36:41.236 --> 36:42.237
Pull in right here.

36:42.237 --> 36:44.438
(Briggs)
All right, boss.

36:54.278 --> 36:55.779
(Layla)
Ari didn't even call.

36:55.779 --> 36:57.280
(Colby)
He doesn't--

36:57.280 --> 36:58.814
He's afraid of your father
finding out about you.

36:58.814 --> 37:00.349
You know that.

37:00.349 --> 37:02.784
What are you doing here
anyway?

37:02.784 --> 37:04.551
Ari said you quit
working for him.

37:04.551 --> 37:06.486
Well, when your friend needs
your help,

37:06.486 --> 37:07.954
you got to come
out of retirement.

37:07.954 --> 37:10.755
Hey.

37:10.755 --> 37:12.890
He wants to elope.

37:12.890 --> 37:14.925
[scoffs]
Bullshit.

37:14.925 --> 37:16.526
Not bullshit.

37:16.526 --> 37:19.761
He loves you, Layla.

37:19.761 --> 37:21.862
- Is that right?
- Yes.

37:21.862 --> 37:24.631
Congratulations.

37:26.266 --> 37:27.399
I'll just call him.

37:27.399 --> 37:28.701
Well...

37:28.701 --> 37:30.702
your father has him looking
for the guy that hit you,

37:30.702 --> 37:32.536
so he's not alone.

37:33.804 --> 37:36.672
- [sighs]
- But he is coming, Layla.

37:36.672 --> 37:38.573
And he wants you
to be happy.

37:38.573 --> 37:41.508
Wants you to draw a bath
and relax...

37:41.508 --> 37:42.843
get comfortable.

37:42.843 --> 37:45.378
[slaps knees]

37:49.414 --> 37:50.815
Fine.

37:50.815 --> 37:53.516
Just tell him to hurry.

37:53.516 --> 37:55.517
You know he'll want to join me
for a bath.

37:55.517 --> 37:59.554
Yep, I'll get you another glass
to celebrate.

37:59.554 --> 38:01.255
Okay.

38:05.758 --> 38:08.460
[sighs]

38:13.429 --> 38:15.198
[champagne pouring]

38:15.198 --> 38:16.698
[knock at door]

38:16.698 --> 38:18.666
Come in.

38:21.268 --> 38:22.635
Here you go.

38:22.635 --> 38:24.570
Oh, you're too good
to me, Colby. Thank you.

38:24.570 --> 38:26.839
[chuckles]
Just hoping Ari gets
what he deserves.

38:26.839 --> 38:28.406
I brought you a robe.

38:28.406 --> 38:30.907
I'm gonna hang up
your clothes.

38:40.180 --> 38:41.714
Hey.
How's it going?

38:41.714 --> 38:43.549
Should be lights out soon.

38:43.549 --> 38:45.784
Okay, good, just make sure
you take her out of the bathtub

38:45.784 --> 38:48.252
before the drink hits.

38:48.252 --> 38:50.420
One death today
is more than enough.

38:50.420 --> 38:52.188
Yeah.

38:52.188 --> 38:55.591
Ah, this dress is actually
kind of cute.

38:55.591 --> 38:58.192
Yeah.

38:58.192 --> 38:59.693
Thanks.

39:04.430 --> 39:07.432
[indistinct conversation on TV]

39:35.216 --> 39:38.552
[siren wailing in the distance]

39:51.226 --> 39:54.295
[coins rattling]

39:58.632 --> 40:00.833
[can rattles]

40:05.335 --> 40:08.137
[can hisses]

40:23.214 --> 40:25.916
[door slams]

40:34.354 --> 40:35.689
[sighs]

40:35.689 --> 40:36.890
Awesome.

40:36.890 --> 40:38.624
There's no one here, Ari.

40:38.624 --> 40:41.226
Why did you
bring me here, huh?

40:41.226 --> 40:43.294
Hmm.

40:44.895 --> 40:47.630
Well, let's have
a look behind...

40:47.630 --> 40:49.865
door number two.

40:49.865 --> 40:52.184
Shall we?

40:52.184 --> 40:53.452
Ari, don't play.

40:53.452 --> 40:57.222
[sniffing]

40:57.222 --> 41:00.526
Ooh.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.904
Colby.

41:11.904 --> 41:14.439
[exhales sharply]

41:14.439 --> 41:17.209
You look real broken up
about this.

41:29.221 --> 41:30.489
Guy...

41:30.489 --> 41:32.357
[exhales deeply]

41:32.357 --> 41:34.593
We got to to have
a little talk.

42:05.524 --> 42:08.193
[dog barking]
