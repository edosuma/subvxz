00:19.110 --> 00:21.911
Don't do it.

00:21.946 --> 00:23.780
Please.

00:23.814 --> 00:25.081
We're almost home.

00:25.149 --> 00:27.917
There's no home.
Not yet.

00:34.391 --> 00:36.793
We haven't eaten
in three days.

00:45.302 --> 00:47.403
Dan, you all right?

00:47.471 --> 00:51.141
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.
Let's keep moving.

01:04.522 --> 01:06.890
There's no one here.

01:12.563 --> 01:15.865
It's a message from Hal.

01:15.900 --> 01:17.600
See,
I told you he'd be fine.

01:20.437 --> 01:22.539
Hal's telling us
they had to leave.

01:22.573 --> 01:24.874
Those numbers
should tell us where they went.

01:24.942 --> 01:27.377
Why don't we try to
scare up some food

01:27.411 --> 01:29.879
while you
decipher the message?

01:36.120 --> 01:39.422
Hey, Dad.
What are you looking at?

01:39.456 --> 01:42.926
Uh, coordinates.

01:42.960 --> 01:46.129
Longitude and latitude.

01:46.163 --> 01:49.299
30 miles
to the southwest.

01:49.333 --> 01:51.134
Right there.

01:51.168 --> 01:54.170
Hmm. Another hike.
We can do it.

01:54.205 --> 01:55.672
What do you think's
over there?

01:55.706 --> 01:57.106
I don't know.

01:57.141 --> 01:59.275
"Croatoan"
implies that Hal

01:59.310 --> 02:01.177
took everybody
to a safer place.

02:01.212 --> 02:03.046
I suggest
we go join them.

02:04.448 --> 02:06.316
<i> A place of...</i>

02:06.350 --> 02:09.219
<i>All will...</i>

02:09.252 --> 02:12.255

02:46.737 --> 02:49.125
<i>All will be welcome.</i>

02:55.132 --> 02:57.100
<i>A place of peace.</i>

04:13.344 --> 04:15.278
He goes down
about 100 yards,

04:15.346 --> 04:17.581
turns around, and comes back.
It's too tight, man.

04:17.615 --> 04:19.082
We can't get 50 people
through there

04:19.116 --> 04:20.817
without that thing
taking notice.

04:20.851 --> 04:23.653
We got to
find another way.

04:23.688 --> 04:25.155
All right.

04:25.223 --> 04:27.023
So, this way's out.

04:27.058 --> 04:28.698
The safety zone
from Lourdes' transmission

04:28.726 --> 04:30.594
can't be
more than 10 miles away.

04:30.628 --> 04:32.229
The Espheni
have this area locked down

04:32.263 --> 04:34.097
looking for us
escapees from the ghetto.

04:34.165 --> 04:35.699
Well,
with no firepower,

04:35.733 --> 04:37.267
we can't even fight our way through.
Yeah.

04:37.301 --> 04:40.003
Our only chance might be
to sneak through their lines.

04:40.037 --> 04:45.242
Mechs, mechs,
and more mechs.

04:45.309 --> 04:47.944
Here, here.

04:47.979 --> 04:50.614
So, you're saying
the scout was a success.

04:50.648 --> 04:52.648
Yeah, it's just another scar
to show the grandkids.

04:52.650 --> 04:55.085
Listen, we barely made it
out of there, man. All right?

04:55.119 --> 04:57.087
We bumped into a couple
skitters. It wasn't good.

04:57.121 --> 04:59.089
Next time,
we might not be so lucky.

04:59.123 --> 05:02.626
No escape route.
We're just sitting targets here.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.194
It's only a matter of time
before we get --

05:04.228 --> 05:05.662
You're not much of

05:05.696 --> 05:08.765
the cheerleading type,
are you, Dingaan?

05:08.799 --> 05:12.068
All right,
we got to find a better way

05:12.103 --> 05:14.104
to get some intel
on these Espheni positions.

05:14.138 --> 05:15.839
We can't make it
through this minefield

05:15.873 --> 05:17.340
if we don't know
where the mines are.

05:17.375 --> 05:19.075
Yeah, well,
I left my crystal ball

05:19.143 --> 05:20.777
back in
the magical land of Oz.

05:20.811 --> 05:22.812
You know what?
There actually might be a way.

05:24.081 --> 05:26.116
I need to see the Volm
about a map.

05:27.818 --> 05:29.219
We feared
you had been captured.

05:29.253 --> 05:31.013
- There are Espheni troops everywhere.
- No.

05:31.022 --> 05:33.290
We just thought we'd play
a little hide-and-seek.

05:33.324 --> 05:35.191
That was the overlord
from the ghetto --

05:35.226 --> 05:36.793
the one I burnt.

05:36.861 --> 05:39.663
For an Overload to
personally oversee ground forces

05:39.697 --> 05:41.831
is atypical
of Espheni tactics.

05:41.866 --> 05:43.199
He's looking for you,
Tom.

05:43.267 --> 05:45.869
Well, let him look.

05:45.903 --> 05:47.143
We're gonna put
as much distance

05:47.171 --> 05:48.972
between this place and us
as possible.

05:49.006 --> 05:50.307
Did you find any food?

05:50.374 --> 05:52.042
Unfortunately, no.

05:52.076 --> 05:54.210
But I did find this
in one of the office closets.

05:54.245 --> 05:57.213
Got some mileage on it,
but it's gonna come in handy.

05:57.248 --> 05:59.749
Sure could have used this
when we saw that cottontail.

05:59.784 --> 06:01.284
Huh, buddy?

06:02.720 --> 06:05.822
But I'm sure that Hal
rounded up some supplies

06:05.856 --> 06:07.757
before they bugged out.

06:07.792 --> 06:09.793
I can tough it out, sir.

06:11.395 --> 06:13.863
Yeah, don't worry. We know
exactly where Hal's headed.

06:13.898 --> 06:15.966
Can't be more
than a day ahead of us.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.301
I cannot join you,
I'm afraid.

06:18.369 --> 06:19.703
Why not?

06:19.737 --> 06:21.171
It is imperative
that I confirm

06:21.205 --> 06:23.173
the position
of my reconnaissance team.

06:23.207 --> 06:24.674
Progress must continue

06:24.742 --> 06:27.177
on locating
the Espheni power source.

06:27.211 --> 06:30.714
I will find you
as soon as I'm able.

06:30.781 --> 06:32.849
Might be kind of dangerous
out there alone.

06:32.883 --> 06:34.351
I will be fine.

06:34.385 --> 06:36.720
And I will be
joining you soon.

06:36.754 --> 06:38.288
Uh...

06:38.322 --> 06:40.357
Be safe, Tom Mason.

06:40.391 --> 06:42.158
You too.

06:42.193 --> 06:44.160
Cochise.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.261
Gentlemen.

06:47.431 --> 06:50.066
Think he'll be okay, Dad?
He's gonna be fine.

06:50.101 --> 06:52.068
He knows how to handle himself.
Let's move out.

07:04.982 --> 07:07.017
What are your plans
for my daughter?

07:08.886 --> 07:11.721
I'm protecting her.

07:11.756 --> 07:13.056
From what?

07:13.090 --> 07:15.759
I'm warning you.

07:15.793 --> 07:19.262
This can get very ugly
very fast.

07:19.296 --> 07:21.431
Why were you sent here
to interfere with her?

07:21.465 --> 07:24.768
No one sent me.
I'm acting on my own

07:24.802 --> 07:27.303
to keep her safe, to join her
on the path to peace.

07:27.338 --> 07:28.838
You expect
me to believe

07:28.906 --> 07:31.174
you want peace
between our races?

07:31.208 --> 07:33.176
You don't have
even the slightest idea

07:33.210 --> 07:34.811
what she is, do you?

07:34.845 --> 07:37.947
I'm not like the others.
I'm not involved in your war.

07:37.982 --> 07:40.850
Lexi is something
new and unique --

07:40.885 --> 07:42.852
a link between
human and Espheni.

07:42.887 --> 07:45.188
Please believe me.
I don't.

07:45.222 --> 07:48.358
What possible reason
could I have for trusting you?

07:48.392 --> 07:49.492
If you don't,
it could be

07:49.560 --> 07:51.127
very dangerous
for her and for you.

07:55.533 --> 07:58.168
Something's wrong
with Ben.

07:59.904 --> 08:02.005
What are you doing
to him?

08:02.039 --> 08:03.873
This connection
is difficult for him.

08:03.908 --> 08:05.875
I certainly don't want
any harm to come to him.

08:05.910 --> 08:07.343
Let him go! Now!

08:07.378 --> 08:09.012
Now!

08:11.048 --> 08:12.515
It's too much for him!

08:12.583 --> 08:14.184
He needs a break!

08:18.489 --> 08:20.990
Don't think this is over.

08:21.025 --> 08:22.325
I'm coming back.

08:22.359 --> 08:25.462
And next time,
I won't be so gentle.

08:25.496 --> 08:28.398
You will tell me
what I want to know.

08:35.390 --> 08:38.558
Looks like
they got the trucks moving.

08:38.594 --> 08:40.695
I knew Hal was okay.

08:40.761 --> 08:43.230
We can follow these tracks,
but let's keep our eyes open.

08:43.265 --> 08:45.232
Heads up.

08:45.267 --> 08:47.435
We got bogeys up there.

08:52.474 --> 08:54.408
You smell that?

08:54.476 --> 08:55.776
They're
cooking something.

08:55.811 --> 08:58.579
Could be refugees
from the ghetto.

08:58.614 --> 08:59.847
Probably best
we go around them.

08:59.881 --> 09:02.917
Dad...
They have food.

09:06.421 --> 09:08.556
Okay.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.257
Maybe this time
we'll catch a break.

09:10.292 --> 09:11.892
I'll cover you.

09:11.927 --> 09:16.430
Stick with me, Matt.
Stay close.

09:16.465 --> 09:19.567
Ooh.

09:19.601 --> 09:22.303
We don't
want any trouble.

09:22.337 --> 09:24.939
We've been on the run a few days
and we smelled your food.

09:25.007 --> 09:26.340
Who's "we"?

09:26.375 --> 09:29.477
Well, let's just start
with me.

09:29.511 --> 09:30.778
Name's Tom Mason.

09:30.846 --> 09:34.682
Don't have any more food,
pal. Sorry.

09:34.716 --> 09:36.550
Tom Mason?

09:36.585 --> 09:39.487
Yeah.

09:39.521 --> 09:41.322
You're a legend, man.

09:41.356 --> 09:42.957
You're the ghost!

09:42.991 --> 09:44.725
Oh, we heard
all about you.

09:44.760 --> 09:46.880
Yeah. I-I'm Nick Phillips.
This is my brother, Cooper.

09:46.928 --> 09:48.763
Hey. Uh,
what's ours is yours.

09:48.797 --> 09:50.297
Please, come join us.

09:56.905 --> 10:00.408
This is Colonel Weaver,
My son, Matt.

10:00.475 --> 10:02.743
Hey, Matt. Colonel.

10:02.778 --> 10:04.779
Come over by the fire.
There you go.

10:04.846 --> 10:07.581
You go easy on it.
You'll give yourself a gut ache.

10:07.616 --> 10:10.616
Oh, that's all right. I think a gut ache
is exactly what the doctor ordered.

10:11.887 --> 10:15.723
Thank you.
Our pleasure.

10:26.668 --> 10:29.470
You said
you would talk to him,

10:29.538 --> 10:31.472
but instead
you took him hostage.

10:31.540 --> 10:33.541
You lied to me!
My own mother.

10:33.575 --> 10:35.376
The Espheni are monsters,
Lexi.

10:35.410 --> 10:37.845
He's not like the others.
He's lying to you.

10:37.879 --> 10:39.580
You said
you only wanted to

10:39.614 --> 10:41.482
talk to him,
that you wouldn't harm him.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.651
I haven't harmed him.
I'm only trying to protect you.

10:43.685 --> 10:45.686
So is he.
When the walls came down,

10:45.721 --> 10:47.855
when we had to run,
he found me.

10:47.889 --> 10:49.356
He kept me safe.

10:49.391 --> 10:51.025
You have to let him go.

10:51.093 --> 10:53.027
I can't do that.

10:53.095 --> 10:55.029
Don't make me defy you.

10:55.063 --> 10:57.965
We both know
I don't need your permission.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.867
Maybe not.

10:59.901 --> 11:02.002
But I am
still your mother,

11:02.070 --> 11:04.371
and you do need to
deal with me, Lexi,

11:04.439 --> 11:06.507
because I have been
fighting those animals

11:06.541 --> 11:08.342
a lot longer
than you can imagine.

11:08.376 --> 11:11.011
That thing is locked up
for a damn good reason.

11:11.046 --> 11:14.381
And that is to protect you.
That's my job.

11:14.416 --> 11:16.383
And I'm not gonna stop
until I know you

11:16.418 --> 11:18.719
and the rest of our family
is safe.

11:18.754 --> 11:21.856
I need him,
and you're keeping him from me!

11:21.890 --> 11:23.524
Lexi!

11:25.560 --> 11:27.728
Lexi!

11:30.499 --> 11:32.666
I can't breathe!

11:32.701 --> 11:34.502
Lexi! Lexi!

11:36.505 --> 11:37.772
Lexi! Ugh!

11:39.975 --> 11:42.510
Lexi?

11:42.544 --> 11:45.780
Hold it and then
just let it go like this.

11:45.814 --> 11:47.481
Whack!

11:47.516 --> 11:50.384
Mm-hmm.
Your brother's good with kids.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.720
You know,
Coop was a sous chef

11:52.754 --> 11:58.058
at a cajun place in Augusta
before the aliens.

11:58.093 --> 12:01.495
A sous chef? Classic.

12:01.530 --> 12:02.997
How about you?

12:03.031 --> 12:06.834
I worked at Goldman Sachs.
How funny is that?

12:06.868 --> 12:08.836
Long way
from Wall Street.

12:08.870 --> 12:11.038
A few years ago,
if you told me I'd be

12:11.072 --> 12:14.875
out in the woods drinking
Kentucky bourbon by the fire,

12:14.910 --> 12:17.611
hiding from aliens...

12:17.646 --> 12:20.548
You guys
are pretty well outfitted.

12:20.582 --> 12:23.417
We've been scavenging every
abandoned building and house

12:23.451 --> 12:25.886
for the last three years.
Where'd you find all this stuff?

12:25.954 --> 12:29.089
A couple weeks ago,
we, uh, came across

12:29.124 --> 12:32.593
an old Mormon farmhouse
in the middle of nowhere.

12:32.627 --> 12:35.529
You know Mormons. They got
seven years' of food stored up.

12:35.564 --> 12:38.632
So we took as much as we could
and headed out.

12:38.667 --> 12:40.534
Mormons drink alcohol?

12:40.602 --> 12:42.436
Jack mormons do!

12:45.540 --> 12:47.474
To the Latter Day Saints.

12:47.542 --> 12:50.511
God bless 'em.

12:52.180 --> 12:53.814
Where did
you come from?

12:53.849 --> 12:58.385
We, uh...escaped
from a skitter farm.

12:58.420 --> 13:01.722
A skitter farm?

13:01.790 --> 13:04.758
They, uh -- they've been
trying to harness adults,

13:04.793 --> 13:07.094
trying to
turn us into skitters.

13:07.128 --> 13:11.765
They dropped me into this pen
with a bunch of strangers.

13:11.833 --> 13:13.901
Start picking people
out at random.

13:13.935 --> 13:15.603
I could hear the screams.

13:15.670 --> 13:17.504
Sometimes
these people would come back.

13:17.539 --> 13:21.208
Their bodies were deformed,
skin shed like a snake.

13:21.243 --> 13:25.746
Other times,
they'd have this sort of harness

13:25.780 --> 13:29.083
grafted onto their bodies,
choking them.

13:29.117 --> 13:30.584
They couldn't speak,

13:30.619 --> 13:32.486
but I could see
the pain in their eyes.

13:32.520 --> 13:36.891
Most of the time,
they just died.

13:36.925 --> 13:39.727
They hadn't
perfected the process yet.

13:39.794 --> 13:43.597
Beta testing, I guess.

13:43.665 --> 13:45.532
One night, uh,

13:45.567 --> 13:48.869
they cleared us all
out of that damn pen.

13:48.937 --> 13:50.604
Suddenly,
there was this explosion.

13:50.639 --> 13:52.907
It was enough of a diversion
for me to get away.

13:52.974 --> 13:57.444
And when I got back
to my people, it was...

13:57.479 --> 14:01.682
Well...it was too late.

14:01.750 --> 14:04.551
We've all lost people.

14:04.586 --> 14:07.521
I'm sure you did
everything you could.

14:07.589 --> 14:11.692
Coop was the only one
from my group who got away.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.461
Thank God for that.
Otherwise...

14:14.529 --> 14:17.164
I'd be all alone.

14:17.198 --> 14:20.634
Damn it, Coop!
You almost hit me.

14:23.038 --> 14:26.273
All right, Matt.
Time to turn in.

14:26.308 --> 14:30.277
Long day tomorrow.

14:30.312 --> 14:32.646
Well, feel free.

14:32.681 --> 14:35.816
You know, make yourselves
at home, you guys.

14:38.853 --> 14:41.822
I don't know about these guys.
Me neither.

14:41.856 --> 14:44.024
Play it safe tonight.
All right.

14:44.059 --> 14:47.061
I'll take
the first watch.

14:53.001 --> 14:54.969
Could we use
your recon drones

14:55.003 --> 14:56.971
to track the Espheni
troop movements?

14:57.005 --> 14:58.639
No,
because they're all

14:58.673 --> 15:00.641
searching for
the Espheni power source.

15:00.675 --> 15:03.711
However,
there's one course of action

15:03.745 --> 15:07.848
that could provide
the intel we need.

15:10.919 --> 15:13.220
So...you gonna tell me
what you have in mind

15:13.254 --> 15:15.155
or are we gonna stare at each
other till the sun comes up?

15:15.223 --> 15:18.559
That would be a terribly
inefficient use of our time.

15:18.593 --> 15:20.027
We'd further exhaust
ourselves by morning.

15:20.061 --> 15:22.730
Shaq,
I was being sarcastic.

15:22.764 --> 15:24.231
Oh.

15:25.934 --> 15:29.603
What I have
to suggest is...

15:29.671 --> 15:31.605
Highly irregular.

15:35.076 --> 15:37.044
Whoa!

15:37.078 --> 15:39.046
Easy there, chief.

15:39.080 --> 15:42.082
You're quick on the draw,
aren't you?

15:42.117 --> 15:44.918
Suppose I've gotten
that way, yeah.

15:44.953 --> 15:47.087
Ah.

15:47.122 --> 15:50.624
It's too quiet out here.
It makes me feel uneasy.

15:50.692 --> 15:53.994
Like there's
skitters' eyes on us.

15:54.029 --> 15:56.363
Sometimes there are.

15:58.967 --> 16:01.769
So, how did you
hear about the Ghost?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.137
Well, we came across

16:03.171 --> 16:05.305
a couple of people
that you liberated.

16:05.340 --> 16:07.341
Oh, come on, man.
You're famous.

16:09.010 --> 16:12.146
Mormon farmhouse.

16:12.180 --> 16:15.015
Fully stocked.

16:15.050 --> 16:17.317
It's almost
too good to be true.

16:17.385 --> 16:20.721
The lord works
in mysterious ways.

16:20.755 --> 16:21.855
Mysterious?

16:21.890 --> 16:24.324
Or suspicious?

16:24.359 --> 16:27.294
You calling me a liar,
friend?

16:40.308 --> 16:41.675
Cooper!

16:41.709 --> 16:45.079
Hey, Coop!
Get over here!

17:16.006 --> 17:18.074
We were right
about those guys.

17:18.108 --> 17:19.809
Where's my dad?
He's gone.

17:19.844 --> 17:22.111
Whoa, hey. Matt, Matt,
Matt, Matt, Matt, Matt.

17:22.179 --> 17:24.446
We're gonna find him.
I promise.

17:24.481 --> 17:25.982
We'll find him.

17:26.050 --> 17:28.885
We'll track them down,
we'll find their trail.

17:28.953 --> 17:31.387
I promise.

17:31.422 --> 17:33.089
So,
imagine our surprise

17:33.157 --> 17:35.792
when the almighty ghost
fell into our lap.

17:35.826 --> 17:37.961
You know, there's a big price
on your head from the Espheni.

17:37.995 --> 17:39.996
You know that,
right?

17:40.030 --> 17:42.332
Is that why you're doing this?
For a bounty?

17:42.366 --> 17:44.868
Nothing's quite
that simple, Mason.

17:44.902 --> 17:47.003
I escaped from the skitter farm
like I told you,

17:47.071 --> 17:50.373
but the group my brother
and I were with got wiped out.

17:50.407 --> 17:52.242
So the only way
for us to survive

17:52.276 --> 17:55.211
is to start playing
for the winning team.

17:55.279 --> 17:58.448
I want to know what you did
to my friend

17:58.482 --> 18:00.016
and my son.

18:00.050 --> 18:02.318
Don't talk to him, Cooper.
Tell me.

18:02.353 --> 18:03.519
I heard the shots.

18:06.156 --> 18:08.458
You want to know
what I did?

18:08.492 --> 18:09.959
I shot them
while they slept,

18:09.994 --> 18:11.828
tucked away
in their sleeping bags.

18:11.862 --> 18:13.796
They didn't know
what hit them.

18:18.402 --> 18:21.271
In their sleeping bags?

18:21.305 --> 18:23.273
You son of a bitch!
You couldn't even

18:23.307 --> 18:26.776
look them in the eye
when you did it?!

18:26.810 --> 18:28.544
Hey, you. Shut up.

18:28.579 --> 18:31.214
You don't give us any trouble...
Or you're next.

18:31.282 --> 18:33.116
Come on! Let's go!

18:35.152 --> 18:37.053
Come on.

18:37.087 --> 18:38.354
Let's go.

18:41.058 --> 18:42.859
She's burning up.

18:42.893 --> 18:44.260
Lexi?

18:49.300 --> 18:51.100
She was so upset.
And then she just collapsed..

18:51.135 --> 18:54.537
When she's mad, she has a hard time
controlling her powers.

18:54.571 --> 18:56.539
I didn't <i>do</i> anything to her,
Lourdes.

18:56.573 --> 18:59.075
Maybe they did.
Maybe you did.

19:01.078 --> 19:03.212
Your daughter's
very special.

19:03.280 --> 19:06.816
Well,
inexplicable, really.

19:06.850 --> 19:10.153
Knowing her has had
a profound effect upon me.

19:10.220 --> 19:13.356
Just seeing what
the human psyche is capable of

19:13.390 --> 19:15.058
inspired me.

19:15.092 --> 19:17.226
She inspires everyone.

19:17.261 --> 19:19.963
All right.

19:19.997 --> 19:23.333
Well, I'm gonna take
a blood sample. But I'm not su--

19:26.136 --> 19:27.603
this can't be right.

19:27.638 --> 19:30.273
Must be broken.

19:30.341 --> 19:31.474
118?

19:31.508 --> 19:33.309
How is that possible?

19:33.344 --> 19:34.844
It isn't.

19:34.912 --> 19:36.479
Anything over 108,

19:36.547 --> 19:38.114
and her body
would be shutting down,

19:38.182 --> 19:39.882
her proteins breaking down,
melting away.

19:39.917 --> 19:41.918
Mom.

19:41.952 --> 19:43.920
Oh! Lexi?

19:43.954 --> 19:45.388
Help me.
Oh.

19:45.422 --> 19:47.357
Oh, baby. I'm trying.

19:47.391 --> 19:49.058
I'm on fire.

19:56.100 --> 19:58.101
Lexi!

20:09.013 --> 20:12.015
Just like clockwork.

20:12.049 --> 20:14.183
These things
are as reliable as FedEx.

20:14.218 --> 20:16.652
All right,
it's got to be timed just right.

20:16.687 --> 20:18.054
Keep that thing tight.

20:24.561 --> 20:26.396
Do you think that
there's any way,

20:26.463 --> 20:28.131
anytime soon
that you might be able to

20:28.165 --> 20:30.533
give me some pointers
on how to stick it to the enemy?

20:30.567 --> 20:33.069
Is that some sort
of euphemism?

20:33.103 --> 20:34.904
No. You know
what I'm talking about.

20:34.938 --> 20:36.406
Nothing fancy.
Just, you know,

20:36.440 --> 20:39.475
maybe how to
shoot down something ugly.

20:39.510 --> 20:42.011
We'll talk about it
some other time.

20:42.046 --> 20:44.047
Don't blow me off.

20:44.081 --> 20:46.382
I'm tired of
running and hiding.

20:46.417 --> 20:48.384
I-I-I want to
fight back.

20:48.419 --> 20:51.054
I want to take my
end-of-the-world anger out

20:51.121 --> 20:53.956
on someone other than
a guy like you.

20:55.592 --> 20:57.460
All right.
Then it starts now.

20:59.096 --> 21:02.398
Want to go for a ride?
I thought you'd never ask.

21:24.588 --> 21:27.490
Ready for this fastball?

22:01.258 --> 22:03.426
In the event of a sudden
change in cabin pressure,

22:03.494 --> 22:06.462
stick your head between your legs...
Kiss your ass goodbye!

22:28.118 --> 22:29.652
We get what we need?

22:30.754 --> 22:34.257
Whoo! We crushed that thing
like a cheap beer can!

22:34.291 --> 22:36.425
Don't get cocky.

22:38.162 --> 22:40.496
Highly irregular.

22:40.531 --> 22:43.633
He's leaving breadcrumbs --
a trail for us to follow.

22:43.667 --> 22:45.635
Don't worry, Matt.
We're gonna find him.

22:45.669 --> 22:49.405
These idiots don't even know
we're tracking them.

22:51.308 --> 22:53.276
They can't be
far beyond that Ridge.

22:53.310 --> 22:55.645
They'll have to
make camp soon.

22:55.679 --> 22:59.515
That's where
we'll ambush them.

22:59.550 --> 23:04.086
Uh, well, you want to
get revenge on these guys, huh?

23:04.121 --> 23:06.088
Not just revenge.
I want to punish them.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.257
Make them pay
for what they've done.

23:08.292 --> 23:10.259
I want to make them
pay, too, Matt.

23:10.294 --> 23:13.095
I've lost my mom,
maybe my brothers,

23:13.163 --> 23:15.097
my sister, now my dad.

23:15.165 --> 23:17.600
You don't mess with my family.
Hey, Matt --

23:17.634 --> 23:19.468
They deserve
whatever they're gonna get.

23:19.536 --> 23:23.806
Yeah, I-I understand that...
You're angry.

23:23.840 --> 23:27.109
I'm angry, too,
but, believe me,

23:27.144 --> 23:30.079
when someone
hurts your family, it --

23:30.147 --> 23:33.115
it can make you...

23:33.150 --> 23:35.384
Well, it can make you
feel kind of crazy.

23:35.452 --> 23:37.587
I understand. I...

23:37.654 --> 23:40.122
But the fastest way
to get beat on the battlefield

23:40.190 --> 23:45.161
is to let the enemy
make you forget who you are.

23:47.464 --> 23:51.300
I had a drill sergeant
back in basic training

23:51.368 --> 23:53.636
that used to tell us

23:53.670 --> 23:55.504
that the true soldier
doesn't fight

23:55.572 --> 23:57.240
because he hates
what's in front of him.

23:57.274 --> 24:00.209
He fights because
he loves what's behind him.

24:00.244 --> 24:01.711
Okay.

24:01.778 --> 24:04.247
So what do you do
with all the hate?

24:04.281 --> 24:09.619
What do you do...
with all the hate?

24:14.758 --> 24:17.393
I'll tell you what you do
with it. You put it aside.

24:17.427 --> 24:21.264
That's what
a real soldier does.

24:21.331 --> 24:25.167
If you let that hate
destroy who you are,

24:25.202 --> 24:27.303
then you lose everything,
and we can't --

24:27.371 --> 24:29.805
we cannot
let that happen to us.

24:29.840 --> 24:33.209
You're part of a family,
Matt.

24:33.243 --> 24:36.746
A father who loves you,
brothers, a sister now.

24:36.780 --> 24:39.715
You fight for them
if you fight.

24:39.783 --> 24:42.585
You're a Mason.

24:42.619 --> 24:46.555
You come from a long line
of Masons -- brave Masons.

24:48.859 --> 24:51.560
I understand.

24:51.595 --> 24:53.896
But I still want to make them
pay for what they've done.

24:59.636 --> 25:03.973
I should have known
you were dirty, Nick,

25:04.007 --> 25:06.375
as soon as you told me you were
working for Goldman Sachs.

25:06.410 --> 25:07.810
What do you think is gonna happen
to you after you turn me over?

25:07.844 --> 25:11.314
You're gonna be
out of chips.

25:11.348 --> 25:12.782
Ignore him, Coop.

25:14.818 --> 25:16.952
Do you always do
what your brother tells you?

25:16.987 --> 25:19.955
How long
has that been going on?

25:20.023 --> 25:23.759
Your whole life?
Nick's puppet?

25:23.794 --> 25:25.895
Shut up.

25:25.929 --> 25:27.530
I told you
to ignore him, Coop.

25:27.564 --> 25:31.567
Probably better do
what your brother says, huh?

25:33.637 --> 25:35.471
Yeah,
that's what I thought.

25:55.359 --> 25:56.992
Well, I guess
that makes us even.

26:01.598 --> 26:05.034
Aah!

26:05.068 --> 26:06.369
Now we're even.

26:11.175 --> 26:12.609
Good?
Yeah.

26:12.643 --> 26:15.846
All right.
I'm gonna get some firewood.

26:15.880 --> 26:18.715
You keep an eye on him
till I get back.

26:33.798 --> 26:36.633
You've got kids,
don't you?

26:38.603 --> 26:41.271
I could tell...

26:41.305 --> 26:43.740
By the way
my son responded to you.

26:43.808 --> 26:47.310
I've got three boys.

26:47.345 --> 26:48.812
And a girl now, too.

26:48.846 --> 26:52.783
The one you killed
was my youngest son.

26:52.817 --> 26:57.454
His name was Matt.

26:57.522 --> 27:00.490
He was only 8
when the Espheni came.

27:00.525 --> 27:03.627
Kind of a perfect age.

27:03.661 --> 27:06.730
That's the age
he'll always be.

27:06.764 --> 27:09.633
Like I said,
his name was Matt.

27:11.536 --> 27:14.237
I was proud of him.

27:16.207 --> 27:18.542
He was a brave boy.

27:20.511 --> 27:22.813
His name was Matt.

27:22.847 --> 27:26.116
I'm tired of your mouth.

27:26.150 --> 27:28.118
You can't shut me up.

27:28.152 --> 27:30.420
What are you gonna do,
kill me?

27:30.455 --> 27:32.556
Oh, right.
You can't kill me.

27:32.623 --> 27:34.724
I guess that makes you kind of --
Please.

27:34.759 --> 27:36.526
Just stop talking.

27:38.763 --> 27:41.498
Let me guess.
This was Nick's idea?

27:43.501 --> 27:46.636
I had kids.

27:46.704 --> 27:48.371
Two of them.

27:48.406 --> 27:50.373
What were their names?

27:54.679 --> 27:57.380
Alex and Josh.

27:59.750 --> 28:02.252
They're dead.

28:06.757 --> 28:09.426
I wasn't able to
be there for them

28:09.460 --> 28:11.228
when they
were growing up.

28:19.337 --> 28:21.872
Got you,
you son of a bitch.

28:21.906 --> 28:24.908
Can't storm
their position

28:24.942 --> 28:28.945
without putting your dad
in jeopardy.

28:28.980 --> 28:31.348
Just gonna
have to be patient.

28:31.382 --> 28:33.984
Just waiting
for the right moment.

28:36.821 --> 28:39.656
I got you.

28:39.724 --> 28:42.759
Don't do it.

28:42.827 --> 28:46.329
Matt...

28:46.364 --> 28:48.798
Go stand
in those trees over there.

28:48.866 --> 28:50.967
You don't need to see this.
No.

28:51.035 --> 28:53.003
I want to take the shot.

29:02.680 --> 29:06.650
Well...all right.

29:06.684 --> 29:09.686
I understand.

29:09.720 --> 29:11.621
Go ahead. Take it.

29:20.765 --> 29:22.232
See him?

29:22.300 --> 29:23.967
Yeah.

29:27.071 --> 29:30.407
If you're off
by 1/8 of an inch,

29:30.441 --> 29:32.609
you might just
wound that guy.

29:32.643 --> 29:36.613
Off by more than that,
you might hit your father.

29:36.647 --> 29:39.683
Count to three.

29:41.419 --> 29:43.887
Okay.

29:45.790 --> 29:47.457
One...

29:47.525 --> 29:49.459
Two...

30:04.909 --> 30:07.711
I can't do it.

30:07.745 --> 30:09.579
I'm sorry, Colonel.

30:09.647 --> 30:12.282
No. You're not sorry.

30:12.316 --> 30:15.318
You're a human being.

30:17.355 --> 30:19.456
Hey.

30:19.523 --> 30:22.559
You're a human being.
That's why.

30:22.627 --> 30:25.428
Don't be sorry.

30:25.463 --> 30:26.529
It's okay.

30:28.566 --> 30:30.033
Hey.

30:30.067 --> 30:32.936
Matt.

30:32.970 --> 30:36.940
I want to
get a little bit closer.

30:36.974 --> 30:40.076
You wait here, soldier.

30:40.111 --> 30:41.811
Okay.

30:49.893 --> 30:52.295
I need your help.

30:52.329 --> 30:53.529
Lexi is burning up.

30:53.564 --> 30:55.698
She has a fever
over 120 degrees.

30:55.733 --> 30:57.300
I think she's dying.

30:57.368 --> 30:59.402
Are you doing this?

30:59.436 --> 31:01.871
You say you care for her.

31:01.939 --> 31:03.606
If so, stop this!

31:06.210 --> 31:09.679
You have taken
everything from me.

31:09.713 --> 31:13.383
My son is dead,
Tom is probably dead,

31:13.450 --> 31:17.286
you've twisted my daughter
and fed her lies.

31:17.321 --> 31:20.223
Everything and everyone
I've ever loved!

31:20.257 --> 31:25.895
I am offering you
a chance at redemption.

31:25.929 --> 31:28.598
I know you know
how to save her.

31:28.632 --> 31:29.966
Will you?

31:32.936 --> 31:35.471
Lourdes is with Lexi,
calming her down.

31:35.506 --> 31:39.208
And what about you?

31:39.243 --> 31:42.311
It must have been awful
being connected to that thing.

31:42.346 --> 31:43.813
You feeling better?

31:43.847 --> 31:45.681
Good as new.
It's a...

31:45.716 --> 31:47.683
Fringe benefit
of being a freak.

31:47.718 --> 31:49.986
Pain, injury doesn't
keep me down for too long.

31:50.020 --> 31:52.488
You're not a freak,
Ben.

31:52.556 --> 31:54.924
What you are
is incredibly brave.

31:57.394 --> 32:00.329
I know you can't
speak English,

32:00.364 --> 32:02.331
but you sure as hell
can nod your head yes or no.

32:02.366 --> 32:04.200
So I'm asking you
once more!

32:04.268 --> 32:05.735
Will you stop this?!

32:08.772 --> 32:10.940
Fine.

32:13.343 --> 32:15.311
You've really
left me no other choice.

32:15.345 --> 32:16.345
Oh!

32:16.380 --> 32:18.347
What? What's wrong?

32:18.382 --> 32:19.849
Aah!
Geez!

32:19.883 --> 32:22.218
What's happening?
Oh, my God!

32:22.252 --> 32:24.420
Aah!
Okay. Okay.

32:24.455 --> 32:26.456
Okay. Okay.
What is it?

32:26.490 --> 32:28.491
Tell me! Tell me!

32:28.559 --> 32:30.293
Tell me how to save her!

32:32.396 --> 32:35.731
Flower! Flower!

32:35.766 --> 32:38.901
Aah!

32:40.471 --> 32:42.905
Ann! Ann, stop!

32:42.940 --> 32:44.707
It's killing Ben!

32:44.741 --> 32:48.377
Ben keeps saying something about
a flower. What does it mean?

32:52.783 --> 32:55.651
I know what it means.

32:55.686 --> 32:59.889
We're gonna
stay all night.

33:03.494 --> 33:05.428
What is this place?

33:05.496 --> 33:06.963
Rendezvous point
with the enemy?

33:06.997 --> 33:09.031
You mean <i>your</i> enemy?
Yeah.

33:09.066 --> 33:12.435
This...

33:12.469 --> 33:14.437
This is home base.

33:14.471 --> 33:17.607
Soon we'll, uh, send up a flare.
They'll come collect.

33:17.641 --> 33:19.609
And Coop and I
will be home free.

33:19.643 --> 33:22.578
Simple trade.
Done and done.

33:22.613 --> 33:25.815
Tell me again
about that skitter farm.

33:27.050 --> 33:29.852
People were dying left
and right, but you got out.

33:31.355 --> 33:32.989
How did you survive?

33:34.625 --> 33:37.727
I told you.

33:37.761 --> 33:39.395
There was an explosion.

33:39.429 --> 33:41.564
Yeah,
that is what you said.

33:41.598 --> 33:43.566
But I keep wondering
if you didn't

33:43.600 --> 33:46.869
make a simple trade
then, too.

33:46.904 --> 33:48.871
That is what you're good at,
right? Making deals?

33:48.906 --> 33:50.540
Shut up.

33:50.574 --> 33:52.041
Or the Espheni
won't kill you --

33:52.109 --> 33:53.743
I will do it myself.

33:53.777 --> 33:56.012
When did you make the deal,
Nick?

33:57.047 --> 33:59.949
How did it feel to give up
your friends, your family?

33:59.983 --> 34:03.352
I said, "shut up"!

34:08.125 --> 34:10.458
Tell me that's
not how it went down.

34:10.494 --> 34:12.628
Don't listen to him,
Coop.

34:12.663 --> 34:14.063
He's just trying to
get in your head.

34:14.097 --> 34:18.100
Nick...
Tell me you didn't.

34:19.902 --> 34:23.438
You're their Uncle.
Josh and Alex loved you.

34:23.473 --> 34:26.475
I loved them, too!

34:26.510 --> 34:30.012
But how long were they gonna
survive in that place?

34:30.047 --> 34:32.949
How long were <i> we</i> gonna survive?!
I was gonna be harnessed!

34:35.619 --> 34:38.588
But it wasn't about you.

34:38.621 --> 34:40.056
They were my boys.

34:40.090 --> 34:41.891
You're not
gonna shoot me.

34:41.925 --> 34:44.994
I'm your brother.
Put it down, for God's sake.

34:45.027 --> 34:47.964
I need to hear it
from your mouth.

34:49.733 --> 34:51.567
I want you to tell me.

34:51.601 --> 34:54.737
I did it for us, Coop.

34:54.804 --> 34:59.075
The boys --
it was just a matter of time.

35:04.982 --> 35:09.518
They were gonna
turn me into a monster.

35:12.623 --> 35:15.891
I knew it.

35:15.926 --> 35:18.928
Deep down, I knew it.

35:18.962 --> 35:22.064
I knew you gave my kids away
and I just ignored it.

35:25.135 --> 35:29.772
But you're my brother.

35:29.806 --> 35:32.508
And I love you.

35:34.544 --> 35:37.213
I love you, too, Coop.

35:39.616 --> 35:43.085
That's why I've protected you
our whole lives.

35:53.964 --> 35:57.933
There's nothing to live for
anymore.

35:57.968 --> 35:59.902
We both
lost our children.

36:07.811 --> 36:09.111
Just playing it safe.

36:16.926 --> 36:19.883
So, what is it, exactly,
that you're doing?

36:21.000 --> 36:23.101
Using the mech's
transmitter array

36:23.169 --> 36:27.039
to link into the Espheni
remote frequency.

36:43.923 --> 36:48.026
I'm patched into
the Espheni command broadcast.

36:49.962 --> 36:51.296
The icons represent
the location

36:51.330 --> 36:53.732
of all enemy patrols
in this area.

36:53.766 --> 36:55.524
And this is real-time?
This is right now?

36:55.810 --> 36:57.448
Yes.

36:58.104 --> 37:02.140
Purple arrows are Beamers.
Red triangles, skitters.

37:02.175 --> 37:04.009
Green circles are mechs.

37:04.043 --> 37:05.844
Awesome.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.679
This is Lourdes'
safety zone right here.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.848
There aren't
any Espheni troops there.

37:09.882 --> 37:11.049
None at all.

37:11.084 --> 37:12.884
It's unbelievable.

37:12.919 --> 37:15.187
All right,
we'll take this path right here.

37:15.254 --> 37:17.089
We'll be there
in a couple hours.

37:17.123 --> 37:18.924
All right, Hal.

37:21.127 --> 37:24.262
Well done.
Mm.

37:30.736 --> 37:33.572
Lexi showed me
this flower before.

37:33.606 --> 37:35.941
It's special.

37:45.251 --> 37:48.753
Today, right now,

37:48.788 --> 37:51.623
we're on the same side.
Agreed?

37:54.060 --> 37:55.193
Of course.

37:57.196 --> 37:59.731
Mom?

37:59.765 --> 38:01.700
I'm here.

38:01.734 --> 38:03.902
Can I have
some more tea?

38:08.674 --> 38:11.810
You can have
anything you want.

38:13.846 --> 38:16.214
Lourdes.

38:21.687 --> 38:24.623
What was that about?

38:24.657 --> 38:28.126
I asked her
to leave us alone.

38:28.194 --> 38:31.863
I need you to promise
not to hurt him again.

38:31.898 --> 38:34.132
You know
I can't promise that.

38:43.643 --> 38:49.281
I never wanted to choose
between you and him.

38:51.317 --> 38:55.120
No skitters, mechs,
or Beamers.

38:55.154 --> 38:58.023
I'm surprised.

38:58.057 --> 39:00.358
This safety zone
might actually be for real.

39:00.393 --> 39:02.727
Listen to
the born-again optimist.

39:02.762 --> 39:05.197
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.
I agree.

39:05.231 --> 39:08.133
It seems safe for now.

39:08.167 --> 39:09.868
Hey, Dad,

39:09.902 --> 39:13.738
why did that guy
kill his brother?

39:13.773 --> 39:16.341
Well.

39:16.375 --> 39:20.212
Sometimes in extreme situations,
things can get...

39:20.279 --> 39:23.415
Um...

39:23.449 --> 39:25.951
I don't know.

39:25.985 --> 39:28.220
The truth is, those guys
weren't really brothers.

39:28.254 --> 39:29.721
What are you talking about?
They said that they were --

39:29.789 --> 39:31.723
No, no, it doesn't matter
what they said.

39:31.791 --> 39:33.725
Family isn't about
whose womb you come from

39:33.759 --> 39:35.393
or whose blood type
you share.

39:35.461 --> 39:38.430
It's, um...

39:38.464 --> 39:40.799
You remember
when your mom and I went out

39:40.833 --> 39:42.968
and left Ben in charge
for the first time?

39:43.002 --> 39:44.169
And you guys
had that huge fight

39:44.237 --> 39:47.038
and you kicked a hole
in the bedroom door.

39:47.073 --> 39:49.374
I didn't --
Yeah, it was obvious.

39:49.408 --> 39:51.376
No, you weren't
fooling anybody.

39:51.410 --> 39:54.713
And he took
the rap for you, right?

39:54.747 --> 39:58.149
'Cause that's
what real brothers do

39:58.184 --> 40:02.153
whether they're
blood relatives or not.

40:02.188 --> 40:05.490
They look out
for each other.

40:05.524 --> 40:08.026
Those guys
may have been related,

40:08.060 --> 40:11.029
but they weren't brothers.
There's a difference.

40:16.269 --> 40:19.371
Thanks, Colonel,
for taking the shot.

40:19.405 --> 40:21.239
I would have missed.

40:44.830 --> 40:48.133
Someone knocked out Anthony
and let the monk go.

40:48.200 --> 40:50.435
What?!
He's gone, Anne.

41:02.915 --> 41:06.051
You had no right
to keep him captive.

41:06.118 --> 41:08.420
Did you do this?

41:08.487 --> 41:10.322
How?

41:10.356 --> 41:12.023
Why?

41:12.058 --> 41:15.493
I told you.
I need him.

41:15.528 --> 41:19.364
Just tell me.

41:19.398 --> 41:22.033
Because...

41:22.929 --> 41:24.973
He is also my father.
