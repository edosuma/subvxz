- Are you finished

02:39.895 --> 02:41.026
Shawn, can I talk
to you for a minute?

02:42.095 --> 02:43.237
I guess.

02:45.098 --> 02:48.440
Uh, I've just been editing
your release for VitaChew,

02:48.706 --> 02:50.772
"The gummy with its own
special blend of multivitamins

02:51.775 --> 02:53.610
guaranteed to lower
your cholesterol."

02:53.645 --> 02:56.206
-Yeah?
-So, unfortunately,

02:56.241 --> 02:58.780
the FDA
has very strict guidelines

02:58.815 --> 03:01.519
on what we can and can't say
when it comes to supplements.

03:01.554 --> 03:04.258
-Okay, what did I say?
-"Guaranteed"

03:04.293 --> 03:06.051
Our products haven't been
clinically tested,

03:06.086 --> 03:08.020
so we can't guarantee that
they'll do anything-

03:08.055 --> 03:10.462
-Okay, so change it.
-Right, yes, absolutely.

03:10.497 --> 03:13.300
And then also, this line:
"lowers your cholesterol".

03:13.335 --> 03:15.192
We can't say that either.

03:15.227 --> 03:16.765
The best we could
say something like,

03:16.800 --> 03:18.470
"it promotes healthy
cholesterol levels".

03:18.505 --> 03:21.770
That doesn't sound hard.
Just put that in.

03:21.805 --> 03:23.277
Great. Right.

03:23.312 --> 03:24.905
Oh, and then
just one more thing.

03:24.940 --> 03:27.281
Just, you know,
when I add all that in,

03:27.316 --> 03:29.712
I also have to include this.

03:29.747 --> 03:32.484
"This statement
has not been evaluated

03:32.519 --> 03:34.387

Okay.
Just... whatever.

03:42.023 --> 03:43.594
No one reads this shit anyway.

03:45.928 --> 03:49.996
So, it looks like we have to
stop selling Morning Glow B-16.

03:50.031 --> 03:52.097
I know,
I know it's bullshit.

03:52.132 --> 03:56.475
But that woman in Arkansas
went into a coma, so...

03:56.510 --> 03:59.808
The lawyers think she
probably mixed up her meds,

03:59.843 --> 04:01.810
but still,
we gotta phase it out.

04:01.845 --> 04:05.143
But when we do,
we're going to be ready

04:05.178 --> 04:09.851
to roll with Power Dawn B-16!

04:09.886 --> 04:11.853
Now, the lab guys
think that they switched out

04:11.888 --> 04:13.624
the right enzyme,
so hopefully,

04:13.659 --> 04:16.022
we should be able to pick up
right where we left off.

04:16.057 --> 04:19.190
But, in the meantime,
we gotta put everything out

04:19.225 --> 04:20.862
for Power Dawn
like it's a new product.

04:20.897 --> 04:24.470
But when all this shit
is done,

04:24.505 --> 04:27.968
here's what's
coming down the pipeline:

04:28.003 --> 04:31.543
Pro-Lig Joint Pain Supplement.

04:31.578 --> 04:33.006
Hm. That's cool.

04:33.041 --> 04:35.382
Big fucking deal, okay?

04:35.417 --> 04:37.142
We're a couple of months
out from launch,

04:37.177 --> 04:39.276
but I want everybody

12:49.306 --> 12:51.009
Now you're talking.

12:51.044 --> 12:53.011
Now, I know
we're not there yet,

12:53.046 --> 12:55.310
but I've been thinking about
some of our marketing angles.

12:55.345 --> 12:56.773
Yes, absolutely.

12:56.808 --> 12:58.676
When we get
to the email campaign,

12:58.711 --> 13:00.348
I really wanna nail
that grandparent demographic.

13:00.383 --> 13:02.350
Right, exactly.

13:02.385 --> 13:04.715
So, this is gonna sound a bit
outside of our comfort zone,

13:04.750 --> 13:06.992
but I think that we can make
a social media play.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.895
Facebook hasn't filtered
spam the same way

13:08.930 --> 13:11.392
that email has, so someone could
see an ad for a supplement

13:11.427 --> 13:13.361
and think that it's targeted
specifically towards them.

13:13.396 --> 13:15.198
They might not even think of it
as advertising.

13:15.233 --> 13:17.365
I don't know,
80-year-olds on Facebook?

13:17.400 --> 13:19.334

are surprisingly encouraging.

13:19.369 --> 13:21.402
Ah, direct mail
and email has always

13:21.437 --> 13:24.174
been our honeypot
with these older folks, Annie.

13:24.209 --> 13:26.473
Hey, my grandfather's 90
and he's on Instagram.

13:28.180 --> 13:29.883
I mean,
he has no clue how it works,

13:29.918 --> 13:32.248
but that's how he sees pictures
of his friends.

13:32.283 --> 13:33.711
Oh-ho, I love that.

13:33.746 --> 13:37.253
That's a really great example.

13:37.288 --> 13:39.717
Um, now, Instagram doesn't have
quite the same penetration

13:39.752 --> 13:41.928
in the 75-plus demo
as Facebook does--

13:41.963 --> 13:43.721
Instagram,
Facebook, whatever.

13:43.756 --> 13:45.822
The point is we can reach
people this way, right?

13:45.857 --> 13:47.494
-Yes, sir, we can.
-Great. Let's do it.

13:47.529 --> 13:49.430

No previous marriages
and no kids.

25:04.370 --> 25:07.910
But I am the fun uncle
to Dean and Paul.

25:07.945 --> 25:09.373
Aw!
You're a funcle?

25:09.408 --> 25:12.211
All right.
I like this one.

25:12.246 --> 25:13.850
-Is he a good kisser?
-Kiara!

25:13.885 --> 25:15.687
-What?
-Yes.

25:17.724 --> 25:20.021
Oh, babe,
show them the resort.

25:20.056 --> 25:21.627
Resort?

25:21.662 --> 25:23.189
We're going on
a special anniversary trip.

25:23.224 --> 25:24.696
-What?
-Show them.

25:24.731 --> 25:26.456
-Park Hyatt Maldives.
-Very nice.

25:26.491 --> 25:29.701
Private beach villa.
Nothing but cocktails and sex.

25:29.736 --> 25:32.033
-Naturally.
-Honey, please.

25:32.068 --> 25:34.772
What, like they don't know
what we're going to be up to?

25:34.807 --> 25:36.301
There's lots of other things
to do there.

25:36.336 --> 25:37.643
Oh, like what?

25:37.678 --> 25:38.974
-Canoeing.
-Oh.

25:39.009 --> 25:40.305
-Archery.
-Mm.

25:40.340 --> 25:42.142
Ah, basketball courts.

25:42.177 --> 25:44.650
Ah, man, I used to love
playing basketball.

25:44.685 --> 25:46.080
Yeah.
Ah, past tense?

25:46.115 --> 25:47.576
Ah, too many injuries.

25:47.611 --> 25:49.622
I'm prone to syndesmosis
ligament problems.

25:49.657 --> 25:51.481
High ankle sprains.

25:51.516 --> 25:53.659
I spent most of my teen years
on and off crutches

25:53.694 --> 25:55.089
and in and out of moon boots.

25:55.124 --> 25:56.453
Sounds like
you need Pro-Lig.

25:56.488 --> 25:57.960
Oh, that your new supplement?

25:57.995 --> 25:59.830
Yes. And guess who's writing
the copy.

25:59.865 --> 26:02.393
-Stop, really?
-Mm-hm.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.230
Made some great suggestions
a while back,

26:04.265 --> 26:06.331
and my boss said
I could run with it, so...

26:06.366 --> 26:08.102
-Wow. That's amazing.
-Good job.

26:08.137 --> 26:09.774
-I'm so proud of you.
-Great job.

26:09.809 --> 26:11.776
Your entrees are
on the way out from the kitchen.

26:11.811 --> 26:13.239
Can I get
everybody another round?

26:13.274 --> 26:14.812
Ah, yeah,
let's get another bottle.

26:14.847 --> 26:16.110
And tonight's on me.

26:16.145 --> 26:18.244
That's very nice.
He's a keeper.

26:18.279 --> 26:20.312
So, when can
I get this miracle pill?

26:20.347 --> 26:21.918
Well, to be honest,

26:21.953 --> 26:23.788
you're not really
in our target demographic.

26:23.823 --> 26:25.284
Oh, dear.

26:25.319 --> 26:26.956
Got any grandparents
with sore knees?

26:26.991 --> 26:28.485
"Pro-Lig is not
guaranteed to do anything."

26:28.520 --> 26:29.926
It doesn't work?

26:29.961 --> 26:31.796
I mean, it doesn't not work.

26:31.831 --> 26:33.490
It won't make
your joints worse.

26:35.164 --> 26:36.999
And, actually,
according to the research,

26:37.034 --> 26:40.497
61% of users did experience
some joint relief.

26:40.532 --> 26:42.675
Well, 61%, not bad.

26:42.710 --> 26:45.040
Except it's not
actual clinical testing.

26:45.075 --> 26:46.844
It's kind of like
the bare minimum

26:46.879 --> 26:49.814
they have to do to say
they tested it at all.

26:49.849 --> 26:51.717
So those users may have only
manifested an improvement

26:51.752 --> 26:54.984
or imagined they felt better.
It's a whole thing.

26:55.019 --> 26:56.348
Anyway, whatever,
it's a job.

26:56.383 --> 26:57.789
-It's a job.
-Yep.

26:57.824 --> 26:59.956
-It's a job.
-Hey, cheers.

26:59.991 --> 27:01.386
-To new love.
-Oh, boy.

27:01.421 --> 27:02.860
-And to old love.
-Mm.

27:02.895 --> 27:04.994
And to fucking
on a private beach!

27:05.029 --> 27:06.655
Sorry.

27:08.428 --> 27:10.835
I wish you could bottle
that early feeling

27:10.870 --> 27:13.398
when you just want
the other person all the time.

27:13.433 --> 27:15.400
Everything they do turns
you on.

27:15.435 --> 27:18.777
Even thinking about them
makes you smile like a goof.

27:27.117 --> 27:29.480
You're staring at me.

27:29.515 --> 27:31.020
Yeah.

27:31.055 --> 27:32.923
You like the way I wash dishes?

27:32.958 --> 27:35.354
I kind of like
everything you do.

27:39.767 --> 27:41.690
Mm. Mm. Hello.

27:43.232 --> 27:44.429
Love this guy.

27:55.277 --> 27:58.575
But that early feeling
doesn't last, does it?

27:58.610 --> 28:00.676
Which is totally normal, right?

28:00.711 --> 28:02.381
Oh, of course, of course.

28:03.483 --> 28:07.419
When did the new relationship
shine start to fade?

28:35.988 --> 28:38.714
Hey, what you doing there?

28:38.749 --> 28:40.925
Hmm?

28:40.960 --> 28:43.092
Oh,
Words with Buddies.

28:43.127 --> 28:44.555
What is that?

28:44.590 --> 28:46.656
It's kind of like Scrabble,

28:46.691 --> 28:48.559
but with subtle differences
to avoid copyright issues.

28:48.594 --> 28:51.298
Ah, you playing against someone?

28:51.333 --> 28:53.432
Yeah, Alan G-77.

28:53.467 --> 28:55.632
Alan?

28:55.667 --> 28:58.844
I don't know, the game assigns
people randomly, but he's good.

28:58.879 --> 29:00.670
I'm only up by two points.

29:00.705 --> 29:03.607
Can I see?

29:03.642 --> 29:04.949
Hmm?

29:04.984 --> 29:06.951
Here, let me see.

29:06.986 --> 29:10.317
Jesus, how do you use
this thing?

29:10.352 --> 29:12.451
Um, I squint mostly.

29:13.993 --> 29:15.487
I know
a great screen-repair guy,

29:15.522 --> 29:17.588
Can get you another
one for 100 bucks.

29:17.623 --> 29:19.931
Thank you,
but I can't really afford that.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.692
Oh, forget it.
I got you.

29:22.727 --> 29:26.300
Mm.
Ah. This is easy.

29:27.699 --> 29:29.842
-"Mall"?
-Six points.

29:29.877 --> 29:32.878
Yeah, but there's a triple word
score that I was trying to use.

29:32.913 --> 29:35.606
Uch, of course,
he just used it.

29:35.641 --> 29:38.543
Okay.
Well, find a better word.

29:38.578 --> 29:40.512
No, it's okay.
I can do it.

29:40.547 --> 29:43.889
Come on, we'll do it together.

29:43.924 --> 29:47.453
How about this?

29:47.488 --> 29:50.995
"Style."
Yeah, that's good.

29:51.030 --> 29:52.326
Mm.

29:57.498 --> 29:59.872
Mm. So how are things
with you and Tom?

29:59.907 --> 30:01.203
Yeah, they're good.

30:01.238 --> 30:02.831
Yeah. How's the sex?

30:02.866 --> 30:04.305
Kiara.

30:04.340 --> 30:05.735
What?
They're a couple.

30:05.770 --> 30:07.572
They're having sex.

30:07.607 --> 30:09.475
Presumably, they have
coffee from time to time too.

30:09.510 --> 30:11.015
I'm very happy to talk
about coffee.

30:11.050 --> 30:13.248
Okay, great.

30:13.283 --> 30:15.745
So, last night, while Mitch
and I were having coffee,

30:15.780 --> 30:17.483
I put a ball-gag in his mouth

30:17.518 --> 30:19.023
and I whipped him
like a racehorse.

30:19.058 --> 30:20.387
Oh, jeeze.
Oh, please, you love it.

30:20.422 --> 30:21.850
I do.

30:21.885 --> 30:23.720
So, it's good?

30:23.755 --> 30:26.558
Not just the sex.
Tom.

30:26.593 --> 30:29.198
The whole package,
not just the package.

30:29.233 --> 30:31.761
Yeah. Tom is great.
He's amazing.

30:31.796 --> 30:33.829
So is the package.

30:33.864 --> 30:35.369
Yes.

30:40.981 --> 30:43.278
Hey, Dougie.

30:43.313 --> 30:46.644
Can he call you in an hour?

30:48.483 --> 30:50.186
Thanks, hon.

30:50.221 --> 30:52.584
So, you guys just use
each other's phones?

30:52.619 --> 30:54.883
Yeah, of course.
Mitch has nothing to hide.

30:54.918 --> 30:57.259
Oh, cut or uncut?

30:57.294 --> 30:59.261
I need to know these things.

31:02.926 --> 31:06.235
The buzz is fucking building,
people.

31:06.270 --> 31:08.534
I'm telling you,
the focus groups were great.

31:08.569 --> 31:11.867
And the bean counters
found an extra $40,000

31:11.902 --> 31:13.407
for the social media strategies.

31:13.442 --> 31:15.739
Now let's talk color schemes.

31:15.774 --> 31:17.543
Um, actually, Mr. McKay,

31:17.578 --> 31:19.985
I have a copy suggestion I
wanted to share with the group.

31:20.680 --> 31:24.550
So I was thinking of opening
with "Sick of joint pain?"

31:24.585 --> 31:26.156
But I think now
I'm actually gonna go with

31:26.191 --> 31:28.092
"Tired of joint pain?"

31:28.127 --> 31:30.292
because we're not
claiming to cure sickness.

31:30.789 --> 31:33.724
We are simply offering
an alternative to being

31:33.759 --> 31:36.232
weighed down by the chronic
aches and pains

31:36.267 --> 31:38.399
that folks of this age
suffer from every day.

31:38.434 --> 31:39.829
It's a tiny shift,
but I think

31:39.864 --> 31:41.402
it will subtly change
how people read it.

31:41.437 --> 31:43.943
Hey, if it sells more pills.

31:44.968 --> 31:46.308
Shawn, what do you think?

31:46.343 --> 31:48.640
-Oh, yeah, that could work.
-Great.

31:48.675 --> 31:49.938
Incorporate it into the copy.

31:49.973 --> 31:51.841
-You got it.
-Anything else? Okay, great.

31:51.876 --> 31:52.842
Wait, sir. I thought
I was writing the copy.

31:54.483 --> 31:55.878
You?

31:57.024 --> 31:58.386
You did?

31:59.818 --> 32:01.818
You're the copy editor,
Anne.

32:01.853 --> 32:03.996
You edit the copy.

32:04.031 --> 32:05.690
And, and you're great at it.

32:07.826 --> 32:09.892
Sir, you told me
to run point on this.

32:11.170 --> 32:14.039
Oh, I meant the research,

32:14.074 --> 32:17.867
you know, all that Facebook
stuff you were talking about.

32:17.902 --> 32:19.836
-You did that, right?
-Yeah.

32:19.871 --> 32:22.212
And, Shawn, you've been
working on the copy, right?

32:22.247 --> 32:25.985
-Yeah.
-Make the exchange.

32:29.155 --> 32:32.651
Good teamwork,
that's good teamwork.

32:32.686 --> 32:34.455
Where were we?

32:34.490 --> 32:36.886
♪♪♪

32:36.921 --> 32:41.990
♪♪♪♪

32:42.025 --> 32:44.498
That must have been unpleasant.

32:44.533 --> 32:46.368
Yeah, no shit.

32:46.403 --> 32:48.205
I finally thought
we were getting somewhere.

32:48.240 --> 32:50.075
"We"?

32:50.110 --> 32:51.472
I.

32:51.507 --> 32:53.078
What did I say?
"We"?

32:53.113 --> 32:56.180
Sure there's some
psychological reason for that.

32:56.215 --> 32:58.215
Maybe.

32:58.250 --> 33:00.382
You were in a new relationship,
but doubts had started

33:00.417 --> 33:02.384
to creep in about it,
about the two of you.

33:02.419 --> 33:04.056
"We."

33:04.091 --> 33:06.718
Right.

33:06.753 --> 33:10.018
Do you make
a good living at your job?

33:10.053 --> 33:12.724
I can pay my bills.

33:12.759 --> 33:14.396
Easily?

33:14.431 --> 33:17.663
I mean, no, not easily.

33:17.698 --> 33:20.732
An opportunity for advancement
at your work doesn't pan out,

33:20.767 --> 33:22.866
but you've met this new fella
who's very generous

33:22.901 --> 33:24.901
with his money.
Maybe you felt a little trapped.

33:24.936 --> 33:27.772
I wasn't trapped.
I really liked Tom.

33:27.807 --> 33:30.346
At your job, then.

33:30.381 --> 33:32.777
You felt your work
wasn't respected,

33:32.812 --> 33:35.285
but you couldn't quit
because you needed the money.

33:35.320 --> 33:36.616
No,
I've quit jobs before.

33:36.651 --> 33:38.046
I always land on my feet.

33:38.081 --> 33:40.356
"On your feet."

33:43.130 --> 33:45.427
Sorry, can we talk about
something else for a minute?

33:45.462 --> 33:48.892
I thought you were anxious
to get out of here.

33:48.927 --> 33:51.367
I am. I just--

33:51.402 --> 33:54.535
This isn't working
for me right now.

33:54.570 --> 33:57.439
We can talk
about anything you want.

33:57.474 --> 34:00.376
Or nothing at all.

34:00.411 --> 34:03.775
Yeah, let's do that.
Nothing at all.

34:10.619 --> 34:14.126
Okay.
We'll pick this up tomorrow.

34:17.087 --> 34:18.856
Good night.

34:37.041 --> 34:39.184
Making progress?

34:39.219 --> 34:42.319
-It's a tricky case.
-Why's that?

34:42.354 --> 34:45.685
It's not your typical
five stages of grief.

34:45.720 --> 34:48.083
I'm trying to get
some background info

34:48.118 --> 34:49.623
just so I can lead her up--

34:49.658 --> 34:51.856
We don't need
any background info.

34:51.891 --> 34:55.332
Actually, it does help to lead
her into the larger discussion.

34:55.367 --> 34:57.367
I wanna talk to her.

34:57.402 --> 35:00.128
-No.
-No?

35:00.163 --> 35:01.932
She's in a very fragile state.

35:01.967 --> 35:04.308
She barely remembers anything.

35:04.343 --> 35:06.035
So, push her.
Jog her memory.

35:06.070 --> 35:07.476
It doesn't work that way.

35:07.511 --> 35:09.346
A crime
has been committed here.

35:09.381 --> 35:10.941
I wanna talk to the victim.

35:10.976 --> 35:12.976
And I'm telling you
that the victim

35:13.011 --> 35:14.813
doesn't even realize
there was a crime.

35:14.848 --> 35:17.717
She thought she was
in here for a sprained ankle,

35:17.752 --> 35:20.621
which has become
a broken fibula.

35:20.656 --> 35:22.150
-You serious?
-Swear to God.

35:22.185 --> 35:24.119
It's called
dissociative amnesia.

35:24.154 --> 35:26.627
It's very frequent
in trauma victims.

35:26.662 --> 35:29.201
It usually presents
as memory loss.

35:29.236 --> 35:31.533
But in some cases,
the patient can manifest

35:31.568 --> 35:34.470
new memories to cover up
the pain of the old ones.

35:34.505 --> 35:38.133
I got to tell you,
I feel like Frank

35:38.168 --> 35:39.640
would have gotten
this done by now.

35:39.675 --> 35:41.741

1:16:38.164 --> 1:16:40.032
Not like that.

Just like I didn't know if there
was something wrong with me.

1:16:45.875 --> 1:16:47.270
Why didn't I leave?

1:16:49.472 --> 1:16:52.341
And maybe if
I had been stronger

1:16:52.376 --> 1:16:54.607
then none of this would
have happened, you know,

1:16:54.642 --> 1:16:57.984
'cause then at least
I wouldn't be a victim.

1:16:58.019 --> 1:16:59.722

But how can we ever
be okay with what happened?

1:17:24.606 --> 1:17:29.015
All I can be okay with is
my part in what happened.

I didn't do anything wrong.
