us limited allegations

10:48.269 --> 10:49.555
and asking for a response.

10:49.556 --> 10:51.171
Okay, so there's a bomb about to go off,

10:51.172 --> 10:52.478
and do we know what the fuck is in it?

10:52.479 --> 10:55.075
Why do you do this, Dad?
Why do you hoard information?

10:55.076 --> 10:57.209
What you don't know can't hurt you.

10:57.210 --> 11:00.045
Obviously, uh, we are
confident on our position,

11:00.046 --> 11:01.246
regardless of the allegations.

11:01.247 --> 11:03.749
KENDALL: <i>And, uh, this'll drop when?</i>

11:03.750 --> 11:05.150
HUGO: <i> Well, online first,</i>

11:05.151 --> 11:08.187
thirty-six to forty-eight hours.
Um, so, yeah. Not two weeks.

11:08.188 --> 11:10.289
Again, I've no idea
where that came from.

11:10.290 --> 11:12.091
So, this sinks Pierce, right?

11:12.092 --> 11:13.693
If you don't get that
done and signed off

11:13.694 --> 11:15.661
<i>- before this drops, then...</i>
- Can we kill it?

11:15.662 --> 11:16.996
No, you can't kill it. Key.

11:16.997 --> 11:18.230
LOGAN: <i>I've killed bigger.</i>

11:18.231 --> 11:19.599
No, not in the last five years.

11:19.600 --> 11:22.802
Respectfully, Shiv, take a beat.
You're new to this, yeah?

11:22.803 --> 11:24.704
SHIV: <i>Oh, yeah, and
thank fuck for you I am.</i>

11:24.705 --> 11:27.874
This stinks of stale, pale male,

11:27.875 --> 11:29.941
and you need an outsider to advise.

11:29.942 --> 11:33.112
- Cease and desist, right?
- Yes, Hugo. We're on that.

11:33.113 --> 11:35.114
KENDALL: No, we go, how
deep are their pockets,

11:35.115 --> 11:36.948
fuckin' scare the shit out of them.

11:36.949 --> 11:38.050
Yeah, get word around,

11:38.051 --> 11:39.684
our lawyers will go balls to the wall,

11:39.685 --> 11:41.053
say he's super pissed.

11:41.054 --> 11:44.156
Subtext is this is personal,
we're feeling vindictive,

11:44.157 --> 11:46.158
get the senior management
asking where they'll go

11:46.159 --> 11:48.560
- if we bankrupt them.
- SHIV: <i> Dad, cease and desist</i>

11:48.561 --> 11:51.696
<i>and a full-on shit-flinging
freak-out is very high risk,</i>

11:51.697 --> 11:53.565
<i>but we could get them to delay.</i>

11:53.566 --> 11:55.200
Tell them we'll get
into it all with them,

11:55.201 --> 11:56.868
we'll cooperate, play it all out,

11:56.869 --> 11:59.204
- and then stiff them.
- Um, we could offer up

11:59.205 --> 12:00.906
morsels in exchange for postponement?

12:00.907 --> 12:02.474
HUGO: We might be
able to find something,

12:02.475 --> 12:04.375
- maybe out of the studios?
- SHIV: <i> No.</i>

12:04.376 --> 12:05.677
Bigger. Juicier.

12:05.678 --> 12:07.478
- People who are... Sorry.
- (HAND DRYER WHIRRING LOUDLY)

12:07.479 --> 12:08.503
Fuck, I'm sorry.

12:08.504 --> 12:10.238
People who are writing
about cruise abuse scandals

12:10.239 --> 12:12.751
are not gonna be getting
all kissy for a plot twist

12:12.752 --> 12:15.319
- on frat baby two.
- No. Delay is too soft.

12:15.320 --> 12:17.422
SHIV: Dad, ignore him.
Accelerate the deal.

12:17.423 --> 12:20.692
What the fuck do you think
we've been doing, Siobhan?

12:20.693 --> 12:22.093
Well, I have no fuckin' idea, Dad,

12:22.094 --> 12:23.527
because you never tell me anything.

12:25.264 --> 12:26.464
Cave on everything,

12:26.465 --> 12:28.033
get them to at least
sign a letter of intent

12:28.034 --> 12:29.729
before the story breaks, it should hold.

12:29.730 --> 12:32.303
No, Dad, we go for the piece,
we scare them into thinking

12:32.304 --> 12:33.972
what they have isn't solid,

12:33.973 --> 12:36.041
just fuckin' kill, kill, kill.

12:36.042 --> 12:37.208
LOGAN: <i> Ken, you're on that.</i>

12:37.209 --> 12:40.611
Start sprinkling how
fucking unreasonable I am,

12:40.612 --> 12:43.447
Gerri, foot down on the
deal. LOI if we need,

12:43.448 --> 12:46.817
They're half-pregnant.
Let's finish the fucking job

12:46.818 --> 12:49.720
- before this breaks.
- GERRI: Sure, but I have to say

12:49.721 --> 12:51.121
- just legally...
- LOGAN: Now.

12:51.122 --> 12:52.521
I need it now.

12:54.292 --> 12:55.826
What money's floating this year?

12:55.827 --> 12:57.327
You mean for a white knight?

12:57.328 --> 12:59.129
I could see what Roman could scratch up.

12:59.130 --> 13:02.332
- Hmm. Tom?
- Roman's hungry.

13:02.333 --> 13:05.102
All right. Shiv, let's get you out here.

13:05.103 --> 13:08.171
<i>- I need your help on the optics.</i>
- Uh, excuse me?

13:08.172 --> 13:10.507
No. I... I am not flying out to Argestes

13:10.508 --> 13:11.808
to be the face of this.

13:11.809 --> 13:14.376
Then what the fuck are you
doing on the phone, Siobhan?

13:17.515 --> 13:18.982
NATURE GUIDE: So, welcome everyone,

13:18.983 --> 13:21.784
to the Airbus Cultural
and Leadership Walk.

13:21.785 --> 13:24.321
We're gathered here
today with a commitment

13:24.322 --> 13:27.290
to sustainability and stewardship.

13:27.291 --> 13:30.927
So, this place-based
learning today will focus on

13:30.928 --> 13:33.430
creating opportunities
for you to gain the...

13:33.431 --> 13:36.366
- Oh, sh... Tom!
- GUIDE: ... perspective for...

13:36.367 --> 13:37.967
GREG: Sorry, Tom?

13:37.968 --> 13:39.569
- Tom! Hey!
- (GUIDE CONTINUES INDISTINCTLY)

13:39.570 --> 13:41.271
- Hey, buddy.
- Uh, problem.

13:41.272 --> 13:42.606
Uh, you're not picking up?

13:42.607 --> 13:44.841
- Dude, this is a great group.
- Sorry.

13:44.842 --> 13:46.108
You did good.

13:46.109 --> 13:48.756
It's like I've fallen
into a barrel of deal tits.

13:48.757 --> 13:49.778
- (LAUGHING)
- Yeah. So...

13:49.779 --> 13:51.647
So, there's a thing about your talk.

13:51.648 --> 13:52.681
- Um...
- My talk?

13:52.682 --> 13:55.351
Um, yes. Uh... When it got circulated,

13:55.352 --> 13:57.853
uh, legal and comms
wanted you to be aware that

13:57.854 --> 14:00.989
maybe we shouldn't go with
"ATN: We're listening."

14:00.990 --> 14:04.793
Uh, okay. I mean, I really
do like, "We're listening."

14:04.794 --> 14:07.829
It sounds like... I mean, it
sounds like we're listening.

14:07.830 --> 14:09.431
- No. Sure, it's just...
- Yeah.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.168
It's just, um, there's
apparently, in the EPG

14:12.169 --> 14:13.769
on the set top boxes,

14:13.770 --> 14:18.440
the voice activation
mode, it does, um...

14:18.441 --> 14:21.276
Like, there's a gray area in
terms of our data collection,

14:21.277 --> 14:23.311
so that we are kind of like, uh...

14:23.312 --> 14:25.714
We actually are listening.

14:25.715 --> 14:26.782
We're listening?

14:26.783 --> 14:28.216
It's complicated, but... but, yeah.

14:28.217 --> 14:29.507
It seems that we are sometimes,

14:29.508 --> 14:31.820
uh, listening quite aggressively.

14:31.821 --> 14:33.121
- We're listening?
- Yeah.

14:33.122 --> 14:36.191
But it's just to, like,
maximize the user experience.

14:36.192 --> 14:37.759
But if that was to break,

14:37.760 --> 14:38.927
- maybe...
- Oh, fuck!

14:38.928 --> 14:40.395
So, yeah.

14:40.396 --> 14:42.698
So, the question is, is it a smart thing

14:42.699 --> 14:44.966
for you to be saying, "We're listening",

14:44.967 --> 14:46.568
when we are indeed listening?

14:46.569 --> 14:48.236
Why was I not aware of this?

14:48.237 --> 14:50.739
Well, it's basically
legal, the guy said.

14:50.740 --> 14:52.708
But he didn't wanna
put that in an email,

14:52.709 --> 14:54.943
- so...
- What am I gonna call it now?

14:54.944 --> 14:56.243
I don't know. Maybe, uh...

14:56.244 --> 14:59.146
They suggested "we hear
you." Is that any better?

14:59.147 --> 15:02.249
We tested this, Greg! God damn!

15:02.250 --> 15:04.719
- Yeah, I'd love to. Yeah, yeah.
- WOMAN: Great.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.485
Oh. (CHUCKLES)

15:07.322 --> 15:09.189
Hey. Everything is okay?

15:10.391 --> 15:11.726
Uh...

15:11.727 --> 15:13.160
Marcia.

15:13.161 --> 15:15.762
It's possible that some
things will come out.

15:17.265 --> 15:18.565
Nasty things.

15:18.566 --> 15:21.468
People will say things
about me, about the company.

15:21.469 --> 15:24.503
I might need to know you're with me.

15:25.273 --> 15:26.373
Logan...

15:26.374 --> 15:29.908
when I am with someone, I am with them.

15:31.045 --> 15:32.177
Look at me.

15:32.847 --> 15:34.512
I know who you are.

15:42.656 --> 15:43.790
Hey, Rome.

15:43.791 --> 15:45.191
Hey.

15:45.192 --> 15:46.760
You see that guy?

15:46.761 --> 15:47.994
Asgarov.

15:47.995 --> 15:49.763
ROMAN: Oh, Eduard. Him?

15:49.764 --> 15:52.766
Your dad is intrigued by
sounding out big money,

15:52.767 --> 15:55.802
in the event that the
Pierce deal goes under.

15:55.803 --> 15:57.536
Well, it's a done deal though, right?

15:57.537 --> 15:59.705
Yeah, I don't know.

15:59.706 --> 16:01.641
Could you start a conversation

16:01.642 --> 16:04.243
in case we need an emergency exit?

16:04.244 --> 16:06.945
White knight, go private?

16:06.946 --> 16:08.447
With Eduard?

16:08.448 --> 16:11.417
In his loafers made from
the skin of... I don't know,

16:11.418 --> 16:13.218
what is that? Human rights activists?

16:13.219 --> 16:15.521
- (ROMAN CHUCKLES)
- Uh-huh.

16:15.522 --> 16:18.824
His dad has a hose attached
to the central bank.

16:18.825 --> 16:22.894
He's apparently conceptualising
a 300-year investing horizon.

16:23.930 --> 16:25.798
So, this is what, make-up sex?

16:25.799 --> 16:28.668
This is you grinding yourself against me

16:28.669 --> 16:31.771
and saying sorry for not
telling me about Shiv and Dad?

16:31.772 --> 16:35.308
Roman, your dad wanted
Tom on this. I said you.

16:35.309 --> 16:36.942
Come on, please.

16:36.943 --> 16:39.878
I don't know what the world
is gonna look like in 36 hours.

16:39.879 --> 16:42.079
Just... Just do what you can.

16:47.386 --> 16:50.388
I don't know if it's wise
for us to be seen talking.

16:50.389 --> 16:52.991
Oh, I can take a bit of tittle tattle.

16:52.992 --> 16:55.127
Well, you're an old rhino.

16:55.128 --> 16:57.830
I'm just a flighty, little sparrow.

16:57.831 --> 17:01.566
We'd like to ink it here tomorrow.

17:01.567 --> 17:04.368
Sure, um... I mean,

17:04.369 --> 17:07.239
we appreciate the need for
expediency from your end.

17:07.240 --> 17:12.175
From what I understand, we're
still some distance apart.

17:12.176 --> 17:13.811
The break fee? Oh.

17:13.813 --> 17:17.815
Tell your crowd if
they push, we'll cave.

17:18.951 --> 17:21.252
Undermining your own position?

17:21.252 --> 17:23.521
Could you sue yourself?

Listen, Rhea.

17:29.729 --> 17:31.463
Uh...

Can you persuade her that if
she doesn't sign here tomorrow,

17:39.004 --> 17:40.371
we might walk?

17:42.007 --> 17:43.575
Later. Uh...

17:43.576 --> 17:45.776
I hear the culture
hike's the hot ticket.

17:45.777 --> 17:47.811
But I'm not sure you're crazy about

17:47.812 --> 17:49.345
either one of those things.

- KENDALL: For tomorrow?
- JESS JORDAN: So, um, 11:00 AM,

17:55.353 --> 17:58.455
we've got Thomas Fisher doing
"Qualities of Inequality".

17:58.456 --> 17:59.922
- What difference...
- Right.

18:07.732 --> 18:09.331
Hey, hey. Look who it is.

18:10.034 --> 18:11.166
Daddy's boy.

18:13.371 --> 18:15.939
I hear your staff are all
killing themselves now.

18:15.940 --> 18:19.009
Yeah, at the thought that
you could be their boss.

18:19.010 --> 18:20.476
Which you never will be.

18:20.477 --> 18:22.212
No, sure, because of
all the acquisitions

18:22.213 --> 18:23.846
you guys are making,
like, really bloating

18:23.847 --> 18:24.915
yourselves up, huh?

18:24.916 --> 18:26.983
There's a 75-dollar Cobb salad here.

18:26.984 --> 18:29.019
Dude, you should buy that,
use that as a defense.

18:29.020 --> 18:30.887
- Yeah. Yeah, maybe.
- Uh-huh.

18:30.888 --> 18:34.724
Either the Cobb salad
or something else tasty.

18:34.725 --> 18:39.329
(LAUGHS) Ooh, that's...
scary. What could that be?

18:39.330 --> 18:41.531
Is it a hamburger? Is it calamari?

Is it fuckin'... Dude, is it Napster?

(KENDALL LAUGHS) Look, I'm
just gonna say, honestly,

18:47.972 --> 18:49.105
we have something coming in,

18:49.106 --> 18:51.007
and it's gonna make your deal untenable.

18:51.008 --> 18:52.475
So...

18:52.476 --> 18:54.677
I thought, as a friend,
I should mention it.

18:54.678 --> 18:55.978
Oh, that's kind.

18:55.979 --> 18:57.713
That's like BFF shit right there.

have a deal in the bag

kill your approach. Okay?

panned out between us.

19:38.921 --> 19:41.189
We're gonna go with, "we hear you"?

29:25.093 --> 29:28.962
- RHEA: You slept okay?
- Couple of hours. The usual.

29:28.963 --> 29:30.630
What am I supposed to do with this?

29:30.631 --> 29:32.832
- You wear it, Nancy.
- Oh, absolutely not.

29:32.833 --> 29:35.035
Oh, come on. Join the fun.

29:35.036 --> 29:37.871
A show of false humility.
Everyone wears one.

29:37.872 --> 29:39.139
Zuckerberg wears one.

29:39.140 --> 29:42.274
Hand me a pen and I'll
write my name across my face.

29:44.511 --> 29:46.145
You okay for this?

29:46.146 --> 29:48.448
I think I made my
position perfectly clear,

29:48.449 --> 29:51.451
but for whatever reason you
felt it urgently necessary

29:51.452 --> 29:54.353
to put me in transit
for grapefruit juice

29:54.354 --> 29:57.090
- and a plate of eggs.
- You should go at your own pace,

29:57.091 --> 29:59.758
absolutely, that's imperative.

29:59.759 --> 30:02.562
I just think this is
such a good deal for you.

30:02.563 --> 30:04.063
For... For us.

30:04.064 --> 30:06.231
That it's worth a little haste.

30:07.734 --> 30:10.570
So, we have a little room
for signing right in there.

30:10.571 --> 30:13.306
Just in and out, and boom.

30:13.307 --> 30:14.907
- (LOGAN SIGHS)
- KENDALL: You okay?

30:14.908 --> 30:16.374
Is it the altitude?

30:16.375 --> 30:19.111
I don't know. Maybe.
Um, what... what's...

30:19.112 --> 30:21.713
- What's with the... ?
- Uh, yeah, let's...

30:21.714 --> 30:23.181
- let's move you around.
- No, no. No.

30:23.182 --> 30:25.183
I'm not in a fucking
wheelchair. You don't...

30:25.184 --> 30:26.985
I'm good. I'm good.

30:26.986 --> 30:29.587
- (LOGAN CLEARS THROAT)
- (INDISTINCT CHATTER)

30:33.292 --> 30:35.527
- LOGAN: Sunglasses.
- Yeah.

30:35.528 --> 30:37.395
I just had a call from Karolina.

30:37.396 --> 30:39.331
The magazine is not cooperating.

30:39.332 --> 30:41.500
They feel bullied, and
the piece might go up

30:41.501 --> 30:43.701
this morning. Print, Monday.

30:43.702 --> 30:46.338
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

30:46.339 --> 30:48.305
Well... (STAMMER) When?
How long do we have?

30:48.306 --> 30:51.175
Hours. Maybe minutes. I...

30:51.176 --> 30:53.510
What do we do? Do we bail?

30:56.314 --> 30:58.015
- LOGAN: Hmm.
- KENDALL: Dad?

30:58.016 --> 31:00.017
I'm thinking.

31:00.018 --> 31:01.918
We should leave. We
need to get out of here.

31:01.919 --> 31:04.721
Let's leave. We go. Oh.

31:04.722 --> 31:06.957
Apologies.

31:06.958 --> 31:09.960
Well, I feel like the
belle of the ball out here.

31:09.961 --> 31:11.695
Very discreet.

31:11.696 --> 31:15.098
You're happy with this table?
Visible enough from all sides?

31:15.099 --> 31:18.034
Oh, it's all quite adolescent, isn't it?

31:19.204 --> 31:22.539
So, we're there. Correct?

31:22.540 --> 31:24.607
Happy about the break fee, the rest?

31:24.608 --> 31:27.377
Sorry, did I miss the preamble?
I heard that you were

31:27.378 --> 31:30.113
going to apologise for
your outburst at Ternhaven.

31:30.114 --> 31:35.552
Oh, I... I... Sorry. I'm tired.

31:35.553 --> 31:38.555
Well, that's appreciated.

31:38.556 --> 31:40.857
My dad is just reflecting our desire

31:40.858 --> 31:42.492
to get this concluded as swiftly

31:42.493 --> 31:44.761
- and amicably as possible.
- Mm-hmm. Yes.

31:44.762 --> 31:47.363
Every day a letter, a meeting, a call.

31:47.364 --> 31:50.100
I'm afraid my metabolism
tends a little slower.

31:50.101 --> 31:52.569
We're due a check-in
with the cousins later on

31:52.570 --> 31:53.704
this afternoon.

31:53.705 --> 31:55.538
LOGAN: Yeah, but we can sign.

31:55.539 --> 31:57.340
We are ready to sign.

31:57.341 --> 31:59.642
- Ken?
- Yeah. Uh, right in there.

31:59.643 --> 32:02.672
We thought we could sign and
then have a nice breakfast

32:02.673 --> 32:04.514
- out here.
- But before we do, I...

32:04.515 --> 32:07.584
I think there's perhaps a wider
conversation to be had here.

32:07.585 --> 32:10.119
- Uh-huh?
- We would be interested

32:10.120 --> 32:12.422
in exploring the option...

32:12.423 --> 32:15.225
Uh, I'm sorry. I...

32:15.226 --> 32:17.459
I can't concentrate until I order.

32:18.596 --> 32:21.297
Good God, the prices.

32:21.298 --> 32:24.933
I'll, uh. I'll just have
tap water, thank you.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.069
Um... No, no, thank you.

32:27.070 --> 32:29.905
We would be interested
in exploring the option

32:29.906 --> 32:32.440
of a bonus based on PGM performance.

32:33.977 --> 32:38.046
Of course. We could
cover the legal fees.

32:39.482 --> 32:42.551
Your side, outside counsel.

32:42.552 --> 32:43.918
The whole thing.

32:45.622 --> 32:49.024
Well, this... this isn't really
for us to discuss here, surely.

32:49.025 --> 32:53.729
Well, I think I've explained, uh,
there's a limit to our patience.

32:53.730 --> 32:56.232
Logan, I think perhaps
we're not going to agree

32:56.233 --> 32:57.967
to anything over watermelon.

32:57.968 --> 32:59.500
Well, what's it gonna take?

33:00.470 --> 33:02.171
Why are we still fuckin' around?

33:02.172 --> 33:03.572
I think perhaps we all need

33:03.573 --> 33:05.381
a little less sunshine and vinegar.

33:05.382 --> 33:09.177
It always gets a little testy
at the end. We're all good.

33:09.178 --> 33:13.748
Nan, is there not a way we
could sign the LOI at least?

33:15.518 --> 33:17.017
(CELLPHONE CHIMES)

33:21.758 --> 33:22.891
Dad, I'm wondering if

33:22.892 --> 33:25.192
maybe we should get to
our next appointment?

33:26.496 --> 33:28.129
Oh, yeah, sure. Sure.

33:28.130 --> 33:31.965
RHEA: Why don't you do
that? Let us chew a while.

33:33.703 --> 33:36.003
- Soon.
- RHEA: See you later.

33:38.473 --> 33:41.108
So, what do we think?

33:41.109 --> 33:43.911
It's bad, but not...
(SIGHS) I don't know.

33:43.912 --> 33:45.845
We should have gone at them harder.

33:46.581 --> 33:48.081
Paper copy. Now.

33:48.082 --> 33:49.617
Coming up from reception in two.

33:49.618 --> 33:51.619
Oh, so everyone in the fuckin' world

33:51.620 --> 33:53.788
has read it except me, huh?

33:53.789 --> 33:57.124
Hey. Okay, so where's the link?
Why did no one send me the link?

33:57.125 --> 33:58.859
Just fucking Google it.

33:58.860 --> 34:00.594
Google what? I don't know what we did.

34:00.595 --> 34:03.163
Uh, "Brightstar roller coaster rape."

34:03.164 --> 34:05.398
- Give me something.
- Sending link now.

34:06.468 --> 34:08.467
Thank you. (SIGHS)

34:10.972 --> 34:12.005
Well, fuck me.

34:12.005 --> 34:14.141
Do you think they could make this text

34:14.141 --> 34:15.809
any fucking smaller?

34:15.810 --> 34:17.610
This is pretty gray.

34:17.610 --> 34:19.980
Yeah, but also vivid.

34:19.981 --> 34:22.782
Hey. Great work on frightening them off.

34:22.783 --> 34:25.185
Uh-huh. Good work on stalling.

34:25.186 --> 34:26.719
I'm reading.

34:26.721 --> 34:29.922
- Thanks for coming.
- SHIV: Yeah, sure.

34:29.924 --> 34:32.659
Uh, is everyone here
remedial at reading? Come on.

34:32.659 --> 34:35.462
Is it me or is this bullshit?
Maybe this, maybe that.

34:35.463 --> 34:37.397
- Rome, careful.
- Is this one of those things

34:37.398 --> 34:40.567
that I need a woman to
explain to me why it's bad?

34:40.568 --> 34:43.337
- Shiv? Is it bad?
- Don't fuckin' ask me.

34:43.338 --> 34:46.105
I'm not your grope Geiger counter.

34:46.106 --> 34:47.406
What do you think, Rome?

34:47.407 --> 34:50.342
Um, I do think it's bad, but
it's not that fuckin' bad.

34:50.344 --> 34:51.775
LOGAN: (SIGHS) Fuck.

34:52.445 --> 34:54.080
What's the protein?

34:54.081 --> 34:56.014
HUGO: They found a woman, Keerson.

34:56.016 --> 34:59.051
She was working the cruises
back in the mid '90s,

34:59.052 --> 35:01.988
name-checks Lester McClintock.

35:01.989 --> 35:05.157
She says Uncle Mo asked for sex
with her and the other dancers

35:05.158 --> 35:06.692
to get their contracts renewed.

35:06.693 --> 35:08.261
ROMAN: Were all of you in on this?

35:08.262 --> 35:09.528
Did you all know this was coming?

35:09.529 --> 35:13.399
- It's not ultra-detailed.
- Amazing.

35:13.400 --> 35:16.568
- So they fucked.
- It says sexual exploitation.

35:16.569 --> 35:19.237
Yeah, she's saying that
she was one of the only ones

35:19.238 --> 35:20.805
who refused to sign an NDA

35:20.806 --> 35:23.541
and that we derailed
her career as a result.

35:23.542 --> 35:24.910
- Is that it?
- GERRI: No, look.

35:24.911 --> 35:27.697
The old Hewson story, the woman
that jumped and drowned...

35:27.698 --> 35:28.746
LOGAN: Uh-huh.

35:28.747 --> 35:30.348
... what if something happened to her?

35:30.349 --> 35:31.983
It's... It's just innuendo.

35:31.984 --> 35:34.485
The dancer says that
she heard stories of

35:34.486 --> 35:36.788
dozens of other women who
actually signed the NDAs.

35:36.789 --> 35:39.291
Okay, but in terms of actual stuff?

35:39.292 --> 35:42.394
GERRI: There's not a lot of
specifics. It's spooky words,

35:42.395 --> 35:45.997
you know, data wipes, NDAs, shadow logs,

35:45.998 --> 35:47.765
hiding cruise malpractice.

35:47.766 --> 35:51.303
But cold hard facts, it's
one woman in the 1990s,

35:51.304 --> 35:54.138
not like 20 women four years ago.

35:54.139 --> 35:57.041
Great. I'm glad we're able
to do such good victim math.

35:57.042 --> 35:58.810
Gerri's just saying
it doesn't necessarily

35:58.811 --> 36:01.278
- punch through.
- Sure. But you know...

36:01.279 --> 36:04.381
- this is not okay.
- We know it's not okay, Kendall.

36:04.382 --> 36:05.950
We're preparing a corporate response.

36:05.951 --> 36:07.284
Do we have outside PR?

36:07.285 --> 36:09.420
Pinks passed. We've got J Preston.

36:09.421 --> 36:10.621
SHIV: No, seriously?

36:10.622 --> 36:13.109
They're three disgusting,
old, white dudes.

36:13.110 --> 36:15.326
They'll probably just say
they're money-grubbing sluts.

36:15.327 --> 36:18.429
- It's bad PR to hire them.
- I mean, call me sociopathic,

36:18.430 --> 36:20.698
but doesn't this all seem a tiny bit...

36:20.699 --> 36:23.067
quaint in comparison
to the past few years?

36:23.068 --> 36:24.735
LOGAN: He's right.

36:24.736 --> 36:26.837
It's cultural splash back.

36:26.838 --> 36:29.639
We're being punished
for the sins of others.

36:29.640 --> 36:31.908
No one real gives a fuck.

36:31.909 --> 36:35.645
No, no. We... We can't
be seen to minimize.

36:35.646 --> 36:38.482
I think we need to
loudly and quickly say

36:38.483 --> 36:39.783
that this is not okay.

36:39.784 --> 36:42.385
I think the question is what
closes this down fastest?

36:42.386 --> 36:44.654
Do we say it's something
and we'll fix it,

36:44.655 --> 36:46.089
or it's nothing and fuck off?

36:46.090 --> 36:48.525
Something. There have
to be consequences.

36:48.526 --> 36:51.427
Nope. Condemn and move
on. It's just good advice.

36:51.428 --> 36:54.664
LOGAN: If we get into it all,
they'll never be satisfied.

36:54.665 --> 36:57.934
It's bullshit. It's all about me.

36:57.935 --> 37:00.636
It's not real, it's not honest.

37:00.637 --> 37:04.007
They don't give a flying
fuck for these poor bitches.

37:04.008 --> 37:05.374
They hate me.

37:06.276 --> 37:10.012
So, no! Condemn and move on.

37:10.947 --> 37:12.681
New circus in town tomorrow.

37:12.682 --> 37:15.918
What about the, um, panel? Kendall?

37:15.919 --> 37:17.553
Roman? Do we cancel?

37:17.554 --> 37:19.155
No! Fuck no!

37:19.156 --> 37:20.856
No. Obviously not, no.

37:20.857 --> 37:22.265
- I meant...
- Obviously, it'd be great

37:22.266 --> 37:24.994
if we do go ahead with
it, to, uh, have a person

37:24.995 --> 37:27.195
who could speak to it in terms of...

37:28.198 --> 37:29.331
A woman.

37:30.300 --> 37:32.301
- Gerri?
- Well, not legal counsel.

37:32.302 --> 37:33.469
That gives the wrong sign.

37:33.470 --> 37:37.338
No, I mean... It's
something of a no-brainer.

37:41.511 --> 37:44.880
I... I don't know, I...

37:44.881 --> 37:47.783
- Come on. I just got here.
- Oh, Shiv.

37:47.784 --> 37:49.785
Would you? Please?

37:49.786 --> 37:52.287
Oh, come on. I'm not good
enough for an invitation,

37:52.288 --> 37:54.657
and suddenly this blows up
and you wanna jam it up my...

37:54.658 --> 37:57.525
fucking uterus and smother
it in estrogen? Please.

37:58.094 --> 37:59.494
No, I...

37:59.495 --> 38:01.196
I'm not fully briefed.

38:01.197 --> 38:03.131
We don't need Shiv. I can do it.

38:03.132 --> 38:05.133
We can do it.

38:05.134 --> 38:07.301
Fine. We could do with your help,

38:08.071 --> 38:09.203
but fine.

38:10.139 --> 38:12.807
Okay. Let's get out there.

38:12.808 --> 38:14.409
- ROMAN: Walk of shame?
- Yeah.

38:14.410 --> 38:17.512
Everybody out. Business as usual.

38:17.513 --> 38:19.181
So, you want me to touch base with Rhea,

38:19.182 --> 38:22.517
- take the temperature?
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:22.518 --> 38:23.851
No one speaks to Rhea.

38:23.852 --> 38:27.321
- Me, Laird, no one else.
- GERRI: Right.

38:29.758 --> 38:31.725
Shiv, you're with me.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.231
ROMAN: Little miss
fucking credible, huh?

38:36.232 --> 38:38.533
- (CELLPHONE CHIMES)
- Logan, your 6:00 PM canceled.

38:38.534 --> 38:40.868
- Also, your 7:30.
- Qatari money?

38:40.869 --> 38:42.703
Uh, he said he'd meet for coffee.

38:42.704 --> 38:43.937
Wary about dinner.

38:43.938 --> 38:46.407
And Jack canceled dinner.

38:46.408 --> 38:47.708
Playground bullshit.

38:47.709 --> 38:49.543
Everyone's waiting to
see how it plays out.

38:49.544 --> 38:51.112
- (LAUGHING)
- Hang back a second.

38:51.113 --> 38:52.203
What's up, dude?

38:52.204 --> 38:54.047
I guess if you did
have something going on,

38:54.048 --> 38:55.782
you know, like, deal-wise,
it's kinda, like,

38:55.783 --> 38:57.851
dead in the water now, right?

38:57.852 --> 39:00.253
Like some of the women
that went on those cruises.

39:01.423 --> 39:04.190
Ken, I'm so sorry, bro. I feel for you.

39:11.199 --> 39:12.965
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

39:20.441 --> 39:22.041
- Hi.
- SHIV: How are you?

39:22.042 --> 39:23.543
- Okay.
- SHIV: Uh-huh.

39:23.544 --> 39:25.811
- You?
- SHIV: Yeah. Mm-hmm.

39:25.812 --> 39:26.878
Good.

39:29.550 --> 39:30.649
Jamie...

39:32.353 --> 39:34.920
- You've seen?
- Uh-huh. Yeah. It's not good.

39:34.921 --> 39:36.922
- LOGAN: No.
- It's not good for the Pierces,

39:36.923 --> 39:39.359
it's not good for the proxy fight.

39:39.360 --> 39:43.229
- I need to speak to Rhea.
- I've tried calling.

39:43.230 --> 39:44.663
Several times.

39:45.466 --> 39:46.766
I'm wondering, in any event,

39:46.767 --> 39:49.802
if I'm the right flavor of
person to be reaching out.

39:49.803 --> 39:53.071
Now my reputation seems to
be a fluctuating currency.

39:54.307 --> 39:57.843
But, uh, young Siobhan,
she's as close to T-Bills

39:57.844 --> 39:59.343
as we're likely to get.

40:02.049 --> 40:03.683
- (GRUNTS)
- Dad?

40:03.684 --> 40:05.484
(LOGAN GRUNTS, RETCHES)

40:05.485 --> 40:07.820
- Christ.
- Oh, my God. Dad.

40:07.821 --> 40:09.487
- Jesus.
- Dad?

40:11.558 --> 40:14.093
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're fine.

40:14.094 --> 40:15.828
- Uh-huh. We're fine.
- (LOGAN GRUNTS)

40:15.829 --> 40:19.764
- I'm fine. I'm fine.
- Okay. We're fine. Thank you.

40:32.845 --> 40:33.945
- RHEA: Hi.
- Oh, hey.

40:33.946 --> 40:36.014
Sorry I couldn't meet you for coffee.

40:36.015 --> 40:37.716
I've had wall-to-wall meetings.

40:37.717 --> 40:39.984
No, it's, uh... it's fine.

40:39.985 --> 40:43.187
You're hiding from us. I'd do the same.

40:45.057 --> 40:46.391
How's your dad?

40:46.392 --> 40:49.261
The rumor mill is
saying practically dead.

40:49.262 --> 40:52.964
Uh... yes. Fine. It's...
It's the altitude.

40:52.965 --> 40:54.399
Uh, so...

40:54.400 --> 40:56.968
The piece. I'm sorry for all the fuss.

40:56.969 --> 40:58.169
You know how these things are.

40:58.170 --> 41:00.104
No, I... I don't, actually.

41:00.105 --> 41:04.108
Okay. Well, uh, for a few days...

41:04.109 --> 41:05.509
you know, people step away from you

41:05.510 --> 41:06.611
like you farted on the dance floor

41:06.612 --> 41:08.379
but you ride it out. It's no big deal.

41:08.380 --> 41:11.949
Uh-huh. But you're here. Checking in.

41:11.950 --> 41:14.885
Yeah. Well, I was
surprised that you called.

41:14.886 --> 41:16.653
The acceptable face.

41:17.522 --> 41:18.622
Right.

41:20.091 --> 41:21.659
So, you heard the piece was coming,

41:21.660 --> 41:23.426
and you're still pushing this?

41:25.063 --> 41:26.464
You must really want this to happen.

41:26.465 --> 41:28.931
Well, I'm easy come, easy go.

41:29.568 --> 41:30.701
Uh-huh.

41:30.702 --> 41:32.803
And, uh, where is
everybody else's head at?

41:32.804 --> 41:35.372
Well, some of the
cousins are still reading,

41:35.373 --> 41:37.141
which is surprising, because...

41:37.142 --> 41:39.409
they have views on the
new Jonathan Franzen

41:39.410 --> 41:41.378
three days before it
fucking hits the shelf.

41:41.379 --> 41:43.213
(CHUCKLING) Uh-huh. Comfy on the fence?

41:43.214 --> 41:44.513
RHEA: Yeah.

41:46.417 --> 41:47.584
What about Nan?

41:47.585 --> 41:51.054
Um, she's quite unhappy.

41:51.055 --> 41:53.523
- SHIV: Mm.
- She doesn't like a muddle.

41:53.524 --> 41:57.494
Well, I'm around if
she has any questions,

41:57.495 --> 41:58.628
or to allay any fears.

41:58.629 --> 42:00.563
- Sure.
- SHIV: Thank you.

42:00.564 --> 42:03.066
I guess our first question might be

42:03.067 --> 42:06.469
did anyone kill any girls on your boat?

42:06.470 --> 42:07.837
No.

42:07.838 --> 42:10.072
And, you know, statistically speaking,

42:10.073 --> 42:12.609
liners have a high death rate
simply because of the alcohol,

42:12.610 --> 42:14.444
and the profile of the
people who tend to...

42:14.445 --> 42:18.047
Yeah, but the fact that
I'm even having to ask...

42:18.048 --> 42:20.483
Dead girls, boats? Ugh.

42:20.484 --> 42:22.318
It's unpleasant on the tongue.

42:23.588 --> 42:25.622
Well, perhaps the family
would be more comfortable

42:25.623 --> 42:27.103
seeking another source of investment.

42:32.863 --> 42:34.464
I like your dad.

42:34.465 --> 42:36.333
- Uh-huh.
- But...

42:36.334 --> 42:39.703
what sort of a problem
are we looking at here?

42:39.704 --> 42:41.403
Are we in the middle of the storm,

42:41.404 --> 42:44.406
- or is this the first raindrops?
- No, my dad has assured me

42:44.407 --> 42:46.374
that this is not a major issue.

42:47.276 --> 42:48.376
Oh.

42:49.312 --> 42:52.012
Truth is it's in the balance.

42:53.282 --> 42:54.350
Uh-huh.

42:54.351 --> 42:56.885
I think we... they feel that

42:56.886 --> 43:00.322
if it was just a few bad
apples from a long time ago,

43:00.323 --> 43:02.791
then maybe they can grit their teeth.

43:02.792 --> 43:04.893
Well, that's going to be the line,

43:04.894 --> 43:06.527
- so...
- Good.

43:08.431 --> 43:12.033
Well, Nan is coming to your panel,

43:12.034 --> 43:14.603
so I'm sure your flacks
are getting you all

43:14.604 --> 43:15.738
jumping through hoops,

43:15.739 --> 43:19.374
but if you could apply
a nice tourniquet,

43:19.375 --> 43:20.976
then maybe we could patch this up.

43:20.977 --> 43:23.544
Yeah, it's just gonna
be Roman and Kendall.

43:23.545 --> 43:28.316
Right. Roman. Okay. Lovely guys.

43:28.317 --> 43:32.354
- I thought perhaps you might...
- SHIV: No.

43:32.355 --> 43:35.956
No, I'm not, uh, fully briefed. So...

43:37.059 --> 43:38.658
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

43:40.529 --> 43:41.762
Could you get briefed?

43:42.999 --> 43:45.432
Uh... I guess.

43:48.504 --> 43:49.905
This isn't really my mess

43:49.906 --> 43:51.138
- to clean up.
- No. Sure.

43:51.139 --> 43:54.409
But... And I mean, I don't
wanna overdramatize,

43:54.410 --> 43:58.312
but Nan gets cold feet
and you can't buy us.

43:58.313 --> 44:01.482
Your dad could lose control. He could.

44:01.483 --> 44:03.785
That's real.

44:03.786 --> 44:07.588
There are many different angles
to me appearing on that panel.

44:07.589 --> 44:10.925
RHEA: Oh, sure. I get
it, honey. But listen.

44:10.926 --> 44:13.160
All I would say is there is a time

44:13.161 --> 44:17.832
to accumulate capital, and
there is a time to spend it.

44:17.833 --> 44:22.436
But hey, whatever. My dad
worked in an asbestos plant.

44:23.572 --> 44:24.671
So...

44:25.507 --> 44:27.040
It's all gravy, right?

44:32.247 --> 44:35.916
And Roman, the safe place
is the three Rs, okay?

44:35.917 --> 44:37.584
- Yeah.
- HUGO: Regret.

44:37.585 --> 44:39.218
It happened a long time ago.

44:40.155 --> 44:41.355
Responsibility.

44:41.356 --> 44:44.258
Belongs to individuals
and not corporations.

44:44.259 --> 44:47.294
Remedy. Super tough, super vague.

44:47.295 --> 44:50.064
The move is condemn and move on. Got it?

44:50.065 --> 44:51.131
- Yeah, got it.
- Okay.

44:51.132 --> 44:53.000
Right, and if you need to smash glass

44:53.001 --> 44:54.134
in case of emergency,

44:54.135 --> 44:56.136
it's enough of that
and back to the session.

44:56.137 --> 44:59.172
Family ownership and corporate
continuity in the digital age.

44:59.173 --> 45:02.141
- Whatever the fuck that means.
- (ROMAN GIGGLES)

45:02.142 --> 45:04.578
- LOGAN: Hey.
- Hey. Uh, so, listen.

45:04.579 --> 45:06.713
I think maybe I should
help out and do it.

45:06.714 --> 45:07.870
- The panel?
- ROMAN: What?

45:07.871 --> 45:08.900
- Yeah.
- Right,

45:08.901 --> 45:10.784
but it's like nine
minutes till show time.

45:10.785 --> 45:12.919
Shiv, no. We already decided.

45:12.920 --> 45:14.454
ROMAN: Yeah. We're all prepped.

45:14.455 --> 45:16.656
Oh, okay, fine. So, send
out the two cover stars

45:16.657 --> 45:18.324
for Toxic Male Monthly, and, uh,

45:18.325 --> 45:20.259
why don't we get Ted Bundy up there,

45:20.260 --> 45:22.362
- make it a three-way?
- Shiv, don't fuckin' pull this.

45:22.363 --> 45:25.198
- Okay? We... We asked you.
- Yeah, and I thought about it,

45:25.199 --> 45:26.466
and I changed my mind.

45:26.467 --> 45:28.468
- What do you think?
- Me?

45:28.469 --> 45:30.735
- Uh-huh.
- HUGO: Um... Well...

45:31.872 --> 45:34.474
- It's difficult.
- LOGAN: Oh. It's difficult.

45:34.475 --> 45:35.875
Oh, I'm sorry, buddy.

45:35.876 --> 45:38.343
Would you like a handjob and an Advil?

45:39.207 --> 45:41.406
Fuck off then.

45:43.017 --> 45:44.650
It's smart.

45:44.651 --> 45:46.252
Shiv works.

45:46.253 --> 45:49.255
It's smart? A sudden,
last-minute line-up change?

45:49.256 --> 45:51.124
Come on, man. It's panicky as fuck.

45:51.125 --> 45:52.825
She's not even in the company.

45:52.826 --> 45:55.561
It looks... kind of fucking cheesy...

45:55.562 --> 45:56.595
- ROMAN: Yeah.
- ... to be honest.

45:56.596 --> 45:58.597
Like, throw our token woman at it?

45:58.598 --> 46:01.067
Well, it can't be two men up
there right now. It just...

46:01.068 --> 46:02.101
It can't. Right?

46:02.102 --> 46:04.570
I mean, if disruption is an issue,

46:04.571 --> 46:06.539
the audience is expecting just Roys,

46:06.540 --> 46:10.909
so, maybe... maybe we
stick at two, and...

46:12.111 --> 46:14.046
someone relaxes.

46:14.047 --> 46:16.348
- Romulus.
- What, pull me?

46:16.349 --> 46:18.017
That looks like a humiliation.

46:18.018 --> 46:20.853
HUGO: Well, we could
just say you got sick.

46:20.854 --> 46:23.556
No. No, you don't bump
me. That's bullshit.

46:23.557 --> 46:26.138
Fuck that. Respectfully,
Dad, why is she even here?

46:26.139 --> 46:27.225
Because I was fucking invited.

46:27.226 --> 46:28.527
No. I need to be out there, okay?

46:28.528 --> 46:32.153
We need to hang tough,
you know? Together. Family.

46:32.154 --> 46:34.316
Oh, okay, so let's just
get Connor down here, then?

46:34.317 --> 46:35.640
- ROMAN: Oh, yeah, get Connor...
- We'll all pile on

46:35.641 --> 46:37.032
so no one's nose gets put
out of joint. Is that...

46:37.033 --> 46:38.489
- That's the important thing.
- I will put your nose

46:38.490 --> 46:39.713
- out of joint
- SHIV: Oh, you should say that

46:39.714 --> 46:41.602
- on the panel.
- That's a funny joke, Siobhan.

46:41.603 --> 46:43.193
If you wanna know what
I really think, I think

46:43.194 --> 46:45.084
you should drop both these
two, and I'll do it solo.

46:45.085 --> 46:47.196
Wow. Someone thinks they're Beyonce.

46:47.197 --> 46:48.798
Pretty desperate, Shiv. You know,

46:48.799 --> 46:50.516
exploiting the situation
for personal gain.

46:50.517 --> 46:52.876
I'm just thinking about
what's best for the firm. Okay?

46:52.877 --> 46:55.462
Oh, sure. Sure. No,
that's, uh... (CHUCKLES)

46:55.463 --> 46:57.196
That's coming through loud and clear.

46:57.197 --> 46:59.398
She's a loose cannon.
She is out of control.

46:59.399 --> 47:00.934
SHIV: Look, Dad. I don't care.

47:00.935 --> 47:03.770
I can make this go away.
I know this in my bones.

47:03.771 --> 47:05.104
I don't need fuckin' flash cards.

47:05.105 --> 47:07.607
I'm not officially in, so
I have freedom of movement.

47:07.608 --> 47:10.142
But if you don't want me,
then I don't give a fuck.

47:10.143 --> 47:12.178
I will go eat lobster and
watch the fuckin' roast,

47:12.179 --> 47:16.014
because it's all...
it's all gravy, baby.

47:22.456 --> 47:24.857
It's important to remember
two fundamental things

47:24.858 --> 47:26.258
about the news.

47:26.259 --> 47:29.295
One: it's new.

47:29.296 --> 47:31.797
All the things that are new.

47:31.798 --> 47:34.666
The many news. The news.

47:34.667 --> 47:36.235
Your boyfriend's really suckin' ass

47:36.236 --> 47:37.569
- out there.
- Two...

47:37.570 --> 47:40.606
Hey, I'm sitting on the
right when we're out there.

47:40.607 --> 47:42.508
You know, I can see your
bra through your sweater.

47:42.509 --> 47:44.310
- Your dick's hanging out.
- Guys.

47:44.311 --> 47:47.379
- There's no way...
- Guys, come on.

47:47.380 --> 47:49.250
- Focus.
- Ro, Ro, Ro.

47:49.251 --> 47:51.931
Do you want me to get a booster
seat for you, when you're out there?

47:51.932 --> 47:53.956
That's hilarious. Your
period just came on.

47:53.957 --> 47:59.257
We aim to evolve our coverage
into something that is, uh...

47:59.258 --> 48:02.127
not only dynamic, but democratic.

48:02.128 --> 48:04.596
And something that truly serves

48:04.597 --> 48:07.165
our audience's ever-changing needs.

48:07.166 --> 48:10.569
And that is why we like to say,

48:10.570 --> 48:15.908
ATN: We hear... for you.

48:15.909 --> 48:17.274
Thank you.

48:20.680 --> 48:22.445
Thank you very much. Thank you.

48:27.185 --> 48:29.318
- Hey. Well done, baby.
- TOM: Good luck. Good luck.

48:36.028 --> 48:37.126
Well?

48:37.829 --> 48:38.929
Afternoon.

48:40.866 --> 48:41.965
Where's Nan?

48:50.275 --> 48:52.209
SALLY-ANNE CORDELL:
Thank you for joining us.

48:52.210 --> 48:56.212
Next up, please give
a warm Argestes welcome

48:56.213 --> 48:58.347
to Roman and Kendall Roy,

48:58.348 --> 49:01.017
joint chief operating officers

49:01.018 --> 49:02.518
at Waystar Royco,

49:02.519 --> 49:07.289
and political and corporate
strategist, Siobhan Roy.

49:10.895 --> 49:13.797
Welcome. You don't do
many of these, Siobhan.

49:13.798 --> 49:16.165
- Uh, no. I'm... I'm hard to get.
- (KENDALL LAUGHS)

49:16.166 --> 49:17.700
I'm exceedingly easy to get.

49:18.402 --> 49:19.535
(SALLY-ANNE CHUCKLES)

49:19.536 --> 49:23.707
So, I love this idea
of corporate continuity

49:23.708 --> 49:26.275
being a positive in the digital age.

49:26.276 --> 49:28.800
But first, I wanted to
give you the opportunity

49:28.801 --> 49:32.248
to respond to the magazine
piece, which came out today.

49:32.249 --> 49:34.217
- Well...
- Yes, well... Uh, go ahead.

49:34.218 --> 49:35.985
No, no. Go ahead.

49:35.986 --> 49:38.454
I mean, uh, I think
the thing for us is...

49:38.455 --> 49:40.723
we don't want to simply
condemn and move on.

49:40.724 --> 49:42.725
You know, we'll... we'll
want to look into this,

49:42.726 --> 49:43.859
investigate it thoroughly,

49:43.860 --> 49:45.894
and then absolutely do the right thing.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.963
Uh, I think we all have
the same view on that.

49:47.964 --> 49:49.432
SALLY-ANNE: Uh-huh

49:49.433 --> 49:51.367
And give us an insight.

49:51.368 --> 49:53.836
Tough day for the company, Siobhan?

49:53.837 --> 49:56.284
Well, uh, obviously I've been, uh,

49:56.285 --> 49:57.475
given the privilege of growing up

49:57.476 --> 49:59.375
around the business,
whilst also being able

49:59.376 --> 50:01.277
to plow my own furrow on the outside.

50:01.278 --> 50:03.045
She's been working in
politics for ten years,

50:03.046 --> 50:04.812
so don't hold out for a straight answer.

50:04.813 --> 50:05.880
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

50:05.881 --> 50:08.617
Oh, I'll give you a straight answer.

50:08.618 --> 50:11.353
Look, obviously, as you say,
yes, it's been a tough day

50:11.354 --> 50:13.054
for the company.

50:13.055 --> 50:17.025
Sometimes there are, uh...
not errors, not misjudgements

50:17.026 --> 50:18.293
in corporate governance,

50:18.294 --> 50:20.629
- but, um...
- Catastrophes?

50:20.630 --> 50:23.622
Well, no, because it's not really about

50:23.623 --> 50:26.301
corporate procedures here, is it?

50:26.302 --> 50:27.838
It's about human decency

50:27.839 --> 50:29.671
that transcends management structures.

50:29.672 --> 50:31.387
I mean, you know, that's
what's so abhorrent

50:31.388 --> 50:32.874
about these stories
when they come to light,

50:32.875 --> 50:34.108
in whatever sector.

50:34.109 --> 50:35.257
And sometimes it feels like,

50:35.258 --> 50:36.978
"my God, it's... it's everywhere."

50:36.979 --> 50:40.247
Yeah, that... that's absolutely
right. Uh... I mean,

50:40.248 --> 50:42.784
the language... I just would say, um...

50:42.785 --> 50:44.618
Yeah, we don't know.

50:44.619 --> 50:46.420
Right now, we just don't know.

50:46.421 --> 50:48.622
We haven't started the
necessary investigation,

50:48.623 --> 50:50.992
so that language is, uh...

50:50.993 --> 50:52.994
But absolutely, on the sentiment.

50:52.995 --> 50:54.461
I think he's telling me to calm down.

50:54.462 --> 50:55.596
(PANEL AND AUDIENCE LAUGH)

50:55.597 --> 50:57.999
No, no, no. Hell, no. No, I'm not. Uh...

50:58.000 --> 51:00.702
I... You know, if this stuff is true,

51:00.703 --> 51:02.303
doesn't matter to the victim

51:02.304 --> 51:04.405
if these were isolated incidents
that happened, you know,

51:04.406 --> 51:07.041
- many decades ago, right?
- SHIV: Right, and just because

51:07.042 --> 51:08.375
it did happen 25 years ago,

51:08.376 --> 51:10.812
is not a reason to simply
condemn and just move on.

51:10.813 --> 51:12.613
No. No. Absolutely not.

51:12.614 --> 51:15.683
You know, we've been accruing
and maintaining brand loyalty

51:15.684 --> 51:18.785
for decades, and that
trust is a result of

51:18.786 --> 51:19.920
knowing and respecting

51:19.921 --> 51:21.689
- our customers...
- Stop looking around.

51:21.690 --> 51:22.789
You will hurt your neck.

51:22.790 --> 51:24.425
KENDALL: ... to compromise that trust,

51:24.426 --> 51:26.993
we'll take the necessary
steps to make amends.

51:26.994 --> 51:29.496
Uh, we'll do whatever
it takes, you know.

51:29.497 --> 51:31.397
We'll do whatever anyone wants.

51:33.501 --> 51:36.837
You know, it's... it's about
being completely unimpeachable.

51:36.838 --> 51:39.506
And sometimes companies
develop bad habits,

51:39.507 --> 51:41.975
and you need fresh eyes, clean hands,

51:41.976 --> 51:43.410
and new ideas to address those.

51:43.411 --> 51:45.746
KENDALL: Yeah, I mean, that...
that's, uh, the great thing

51:45.747 --> 51:47.847
about a company that's
structured like ours.

51:47.848 --> 51:50.182
We can do that while
retaining core values,

51:50.183 --> 51:51.451
you know, manage change.

51:51.452 --> 51:53.886
- He's good, right? He's great.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

51:53.887 --> 51:55.154
I think I'm a little more aggressive.

51:55.155 --> 51:57.123
Sometimes I think you just
need a good old fashioned

51:57.124 --> 51:59.024
dinosaur cull.

51:59.025 --> 52:01.961
SALLY-ANNE: And who's the big T-Rex

52:01.962 --> 52:02.995
in your sights?

52:02.996 --> 52:07.267
Oh, no. I mean dinosaur attitudes.

52:07.268 --> 52:08.868
Dinosaur values.

52:08.869 --> 52:10.470
No, I would never go after my dad.

52:10.471 --> 52:13.538
- That's a sport others enjoy.
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

52:19.647 --> 52:22.748
- Hey, Tom. You did good.
- Hey.

52:22.749 --> 52:24.291
Sorry I wasn't there for you before,

52:24.292 --> 52:26.585
but, you know, "we hear for you" now.

52:26.586 --> 52:30.088
(TOM CHUCKLES) No worries.
You fucking shimmered.

52:30.089 --> 52:31.856
- SHIV: Thank you.
- TOM: Was that all okayed?

52:31.857 --> 52:35.160
Nice. Bring your
daughter to the slaughter.

52:35.161 --> 52:37.663
Tell the old dinosaur
what you were gonna do?

52:37.664 --> 52:38.963
KENDALL: Hey, I'm sorry.

52:38.964 --> 52:41.333
"We will do whatever anyone wants"?

52:41.334 --> 52:44.569
- Yeah.
- Fuck it! Right? It played.

52:44.570 --> 52:46.271
It's just words. There
was no press anyway,

52:46.272 --> 52:47.839
so who gives a shit?

52:47.840 --> 52:49.641
- Hey.
- What?

52:49.642 --> 52:52.209
- What was that?
- I was just dancing.

52:53.613 --> 52:57.081
Hey, I'm sorry about Nia last night.

52:57.082 --> 52:59.784
- You can do whatever you like.
- Thank you.

52:59.785 --> 53:01.519
It's not like I really want to.

53:01.520 --> 53:03.187
- Really?
- No.

53:04.623 --> 53:07.792
Because, truthfully, when
I saw you talking to her,

53:07.793 --> 53:09.961
I wanted to smack her
in the face and say,

53:09.962 --> 53:11.863
"Back up, bitch. He's mine."

53:11.864 --> 53:13.397
- (BOTH LAUGHING)
- You should've.

53:13.398 --> 53:15.033
I would've really
liked to have seen that.

53:15.034 --> 53:16.733
SHIV: Oh, yeah? (LAUGHS)

53:22.074 --> 53:23.708
It was too much, Siobhan.

53:23.709 --> 53:25.776
- Dinosaurs?
- Uh...

53:25.777 --> 53:28.746
Yeah. It was over the line.
Shiv went over the line.

53:28.747 --> 53:30.147
Oh, I... I think it was pretty clear

53:30.148 --> 53:32.282
- that I was talking about...
- Oh, no, it was clear. Yeah.

53:32.283 --> 53:35.386
You tortured the old dinosaur.
You barbecued him live, hmm?

53:35.387 --> 53:36.654
Don't fuck with me!

53:36.655 --> 53:38.929
Hey! No! Don't fucking touch him!

53:38.930 --> 53:40.224
SHIV: It's okay. Jesus, Dad.

53:40.225 --> 53:43.193
It played well, okay?
Word is it played well.

53:43.194 --> 53:45.195
- It's okay.
- SHIV: Ro, are you okay?

53:45.196 --> 53:46.730
- (ROMAN SPITS)
- SHIV: Here.

53:47.599 --> 53:49.601
- SHIV: You all right?
- KENDALL: You all right?

53:49.602 --> 53:50.668
Yeah, I'm fuckin' fine.

53:50.669 --> 53:52.369
Fucking leave me alone. I'm fine.

53:53.805 --> 53:55.905
It's just a tooth. I'll get another one.

54:04.182 --> 54:07.117
WOMAN: Ladies and gentlemen,
as it's traditional

54:07.118 --> 54:09.686
to roast us home from Argestes,

54:09.687 --> 54:11.388
it's the Argie awards.

54:11.389 --> 54:14.258
And please welcome your
host for this evening,

54:14.259 --> 54:15.658
Zell Simmons!

54:15.659 --> 54:18.660
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)

54:20.231 --> 54:21.598
Hey.

54:21.599 --> 54:23.833
All right. How you doin'?

54:23.834 --> 54:26.336
All right. Look at all you
guys with your blazers on,

54:26.337 --> 54:28.538
coming from Burlington
Coat Factory, huh?

54:28.539 --> 54:30.607
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)
- That where y'all shop at?

54:30.608 --> 54:32.609
I'm glad you guys are out here,

54:32.610 --> 54:34.343
solving the world's problems.

54:34.344 --> 54:36.478
I don't see you solving
anything, jerk-off.

54:36.479 --> 54:38.414
Yeah, that's like a guy
sitting on a grain silo

54:38.415 --> 54:39.882
in the middle of a famine, going,

54:39.883 --> 54:41.951
"Why is everybody so down?

54:41.952 --> 54:44.787
- They don't have WiFi here?"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

54:44.788 --> 54:46.889
Did you talk to Roman? Is he okay?

54:46.890 --> 54:49.425
Yeah. Uh, he said he wasn't gonna come.

54:49.426 --> 54:51.260
But... But he was fine.

54:51.261 --> 54:53.429
All right, who do we got
here? Who we got here?

54:53.430 --> 54:56.498
Oh, we got... The Roys
are here! What's up, guys!

54:56.499 --> 54:58.267
Oh, shit, I hope he doesn't do me.

54:58.268 --> 55:01.837
Ahoy there! Permission
to never fuckin' board?

55:01.838 --> 55:03.372
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

55:03.373 --> 55:05.707
I think this is going to be a long bit.

55:05.708 --> 55:07.909
I don't understand this tradition.

55:07.910 --> 55:10.312
Why do we come to be insulted?

55:10.313 --> 55:12.013
How is this entertainment?

55:12.014 --> 55:13.748
ZELL SIMMONS: I shouldn't even
be joking about them like that,

55:13.749 --> 55:15.750
because they're in the midst of a...

55:15.751 --> 55:17.685
"hands on investigation".

55:17.686 --> 55:20.121
(AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

55:20.122 --> 55:22.557
Yeah, I hear there's a lot
of deals going down here, too.

55:22.558 --> 55:24.192
Man, someone's gonna make a sale.

55:24.193 --> 55:27.495
To Waystar. Hey, I think that's great.

55:27.496 --> 55:29.397
That's like the Hindenburg going down,

55:29.398 --> 55:31.699
and they're like,
"Yeah, hydrogen blimps.

55:31.700 --> 55:33.435
Sign me up!

55:33.436 --> 55:36.137
- That's the future, baby!"
- (AUDIENCE LAUGHS)

55:36.138 --> 55:39.674
No, that's a horrible
idea. It's worse than that,

55:39.675 --> 55:42.042
at least nobody was
forced to give a blowjob

55:42.043 --> 55:43.511
on the Hindenburg!

55:43.512 --> 55:45.044
(AUDIENCE GASPS, LAUGHS)

55:46.982 --> 55:49.350
- Where are you going?
- SIMMONS: Oh, man.

55:49.351 --> 55:50.474
- You okay?
- Yeah.

55:50.475 --> 55:52.110
SIMMONS: Look at Logan Roy,
man. I love that guy, man.

55:52.111 --> 55:55.122
- I mean, he's a very nice guy...
- It's funny 'cause it's true.

55:55.123 --> 55:56.590
Fuck off.

55:57.392 --> 55:59.961

Oh, here comes Rhea. Of course.

56:05.166 --> 56:06.467
Oh. Let's talk.

56:06.468 --> 56:08.168
I... I hope you're not swayed by...

56:08.169 --> 56:10.771
I mean, you get these
hothouse atmospheres,

56:10.772 --> 56:13.240
- but we're good.
- NAN: We'll talk.

56:13.241 --> 56:15.309
- We're good though?
- No.

56:15.310 --> 56:16.911
But we can explain.

56:16.912 --> 56:20.514
(SIGHS) Look, it's, uh...
It's a tempest in a tea kettle.

56:20.515 --> 56:22.282
Relax. I drink them by the pint.

56:22.283 --> 56:25.319
(LAUGHS) Oh, thank you.
I am perfectly relaxed.

56:25.320 --> 56:27.921
But if you want to talk about it,

56:27.922 --> 56:29.689
- it's over.
- RHEA: Oh, Nan.

56:29.690 --> 56:32.559
- Come on. Calm down.
- LOGAN: A few bad jokes,

56:32.560 --> 56:34.061
what, and you bend?

56:34.062 --> 56:35.729
I think you're made of stronger stuff

56:35.730 --> 56:38.832
- than these Palo Alto pricks.
- Oh, it's intolerable.

56:38.833 --> 56:41.368
I had a call with the family tonight,

56:41.369 --> 56:43.170
on a number of matters,

56:43.171 --> 56:45.305
and they've left it in my hands.

56:45.306 --> 56:47.974
Which call? After... After our call?

56:47.975 --> 56:50.344
Rhea, may I ask you something?
Have you ever had

56:50.345 --> 56:53.374
any communication or
meetings with Logan Roy

56:53.375 --> 56:54.748
- that I'm not aware of?
- What?

56:54.749 --> 56:56.016
Um... Not...

56:56.017 --> 56:58.217
- Not in terms of...
- Are you trying to figure out

56:58.218 --> 56:59.485
what your attorney would let you say?

56:59.486 --> 57:03.557
- No! I have always acted with...
- I have been rolled.

57:03.558 --> 57:05.425
I have been sand-bagged.

57:05.426 --> 57:06.660
This is a good deal!

57:06.661 --> 57:08.962
You spoke to Logan on the 13th.

57:08.963 --> 57:11.031
What was the nature of that discussion?

57:11.032 --> 57:14.067
I do not recall. It could
have been any number of...

57:14.068 --> 57:15.401
I would like your resignation.

57:15.402 --> 57:17.370
I don't appreciate being hustled.

57:17.371 --> 57:18.772
This is a good fucking deal!

57:18.773 --> 57:20.406
You won't get a deal like this again.

57:20.407 --> 57:21.441
RHEA: It is a good deal,

57:21.442 --> 57:23.610
and I have never had anything in mind

57:23.611 --> 57:25.210
other than what's best for Pierce.

57:25.211 --> 57:26.912
Oh, horse potatoes.

57:26.913 --> 57:28.948
You work for Rhea Jarell.

57:28.949 --> 57:31.840
And as long as our interests
were aligned, it was fine.

57:31.841 --> 57:33.051
You'll be hearing from the lawyers.

Oh, I think my family will be fine,

57:42.963 --> 57:44.196
but thank you for your concern.
