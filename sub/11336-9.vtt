The mind is its own place,

00:04.571 --> 00:06.137
and in itself can make
heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.008
(beeps)

00:09.010 --> 00:10.510
The mind is its own place,

00:10.511 --> 00:12.011
and in itself can make
heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

00:12.680 --> 00:14.646
(beeps twice)

00:14.648 --> 00:15.781
(phone rings)

00:15.783 --> 00:17.450
The mind is its own place,

00:17.451 --> 00:19.118
and in itself can make
heaven of hell, hell of heaven.

00:19.120 --> 00:21.020
(ringing continues)

00:21.022 --> 00:22.488
Come on. Pick up the phone.

00:23.758 --> 00:26.792
I swear to God I will kill her
and I will take you down.

00:26.794 --> 00:28.660
The mind is its own place,
and in itself can...

00:28.662 --> 00:30.696
Penny?
No!

00:30.698 --> 00:32.097
It's time.

00:35.236 --> 00:38.771
GIRL:
¶ When the blazing sun is gone ¶

00:38.773 --> 00:42.641
¶ When he nothing shines upon ¶

Hey, Pips.

00:52.753 --> 00:54.720
Check this out.

00:54.722 --> 00:56.088
Globular cluster.

00:56.090 --> 00:58.490
Messier 3, I think.

01:01.095 --> 01:04.763
Hey! Who ate the
ketchup chips?

01:04.765 --> 01:06.732
Must've been the coyotes.

01:06.734 --> 01:08.267
Grape juice?

01:08.269 --> 01:10.402
Coyotes drink
grape juice, too?

01:10.404 --> 01:12.571
Hey, Pips, see if
you can find Saturn.

01:12.573 --> 01:14.573
I'm going for more grape juice.

01:14.575 --> 01:15.741
For me.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.543
Not you, me.

01:17.545 --> 01:19.445
(laughs)

01:20.748 --> 01:24.283
¶ When the traveler

01:24.285 --> 01:27.753
¶ Thanks you

01:27.755 --> 01:32.624
¶ He could not see
which way to go... ¶

01:32.626 --> 01:33.859
That was fast, Dad.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.496

02:43.697 --> 02:47.499
that out of hell
leads up to light."

02:51.672 --> 02:54.273
Good morning, Sunshine.

02:55.843 --> 03:00.746
You can call me Sunshine
as long you promise to...

03:00.748 --> 03:02.548
Ah, yes, letter of application.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.717
Basic Tactical Operations
course.

03:05.719 --> 03:07.653
I'm signing it right now.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.221
Thank you, Sarge.

03:09.223 --> 03:10.622
My pleasure, Kira.

03:14.328 --> 03:15.827
Everything okay?

03:15.829 --> 03:18.864
Yeah.
Yeah, everything's fine.

03:18.866 --> 03:22.234
Just... just the way
it always is.

(ringing continues)

03:38.786 --> 03:41.253
Gerald?

03:41.255 --> 03:42.421
GERALD:
Hey, babe.

03:42.423 --> 03:43.589
Where are you?

03:43.591 --> 03:44.890
Nearly home.
How'd you sleep?

03:44.892 --> 03:45.891
I didn't.

03:45.893 --> 03:47.726
I kept hearing noises.

03:47.728 --> 03:49.428
But you know
you're safe, right?

03:49.430 --> 03:50.862
I know.

03:50.864 --> 03:52.231
Hey, you know what?

03:52.233 --> 03:54.600
What?
I've got a surprise for you.

04:00.407 --> 04:02.841
You okay?
I'm gonna wet my pants.

04:03.811 --> 04:05.944
Okay.
(seat belt unfastening)

04:05.946 --> 04:06.912
Come on.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.981
Let's go.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.952
She's been missing for 12 hours.

04:13.954 --> 04:16.321
Police say she was abducted
last night

04:16.323 --> 04:18.290
from a playground
in Sault Sainte Marie.

04:18.292 --> 04:20.926
Her mother says her back
was turned for only a second,

04:20.928 --> 04:23.895
and then,
Lilly Deacon vanished.

04:23.897 --> 04:26.632
Lilly was wearing a yellow dress
and pink sandals.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.033
She has long blonde hair,

04:28.035 --> 04:29.868
and has a birthmark
under her chin

04:29.870 --> 04:31.670
shaped like a teardrop.
(entrance bell chimes)

04:31.672 --> 04:33.639
(TV clicks off)
Hey, guys.

04:33.641 --> 04:34.873
Hi, restroom?

04:34.875 --> 04:36.308
Yeah, out back. Hang on.

04:36.310 --> 04:37.643
You need a key.

04:37.645 --> 04:39.011
There you go.
Thank you.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.980
JULES:
Hey, Sarge,

04:41.982 --> 04:43.315
Wordy said you wanted
to see me?

04:43.317 --> 04:44.983
Hey, Jules, grab
a seat, will you?

04:44.985 --> 04:47.986
Ooh, that bad?

04:47.988 --> 04:49.488
Psych evaluations,

04:49.490 --> 04:50.889
you know they're
mandatory, right?

04:50.891 --> 04:52.424
Yeah, I do. I just, uh...

04:52.426 --> 04:54.293
You just haven't
signed up for one yet.

04:54.295 --> 04:55.961
Everyone else has done

04:55.963 --> 04:57.663
theirs already,
and I wanted to make sure

04:57.665 --> 04:58.897
things were copacetic.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.666
Everything's copacetic.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.835
Look. Look at me.
I'm signing up right now.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.338
You know it's like this
with you every year, Jules.

05:06.340 --> 05:09.041
It's like, uh,
nobody likes to do this.

05:09.043 --> 05:11.843
I know,
they just freak me out.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.345
All those questions.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.614
Who do you like better:
your mom or dad?

05:15.616 --> 05:17.082
You want
to garden or paint?

05:17.084 --> 05:19.017
Fly a plane?

05:19.019 --> 05:20.652
Jump on a train?

05:20.654 --> 05:21.853
They're just questions.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.622
No right or wrong answers.

05:23.624 --> 05:26.358
That's the problem:
I like right or wrong.

05:26.360 --> 05:28.527
You shoot. There's a target.
You hit it.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.629
Bull's-eye.
Bam. You go home.

05:30.631 --> 05:32.631
That's true.
You can be perfect.

05:32.633 --> 05:34.333
Scared to make mistakes--

05:34.335 --> 05:35.901
it's going to get
in your way.

05:35.903 --> 05:36.902
We're human.

05:36.904 --> 05:38.437
We're going to get things wrong.

05:42.343 --> 05:43.475
(entrance bell chimes)
Hey, great.

05:43.477 --> 05:44.576
So pump #2?

05:44.578 --> 05:47.112
That's, uh, $47.28, please.

05:48.515 --> 05:50.415
Hey, who's this?
What's your name?

05:50.417 --> 05:52.751
Jack. He's a little shy.

05:52.753 --> 05:53.952
Oh.

05:58.425 --> 06:00.992
Hey, Jack, uh, tell me.

06:00.994 --> 06:02.494
(wrappers rustling)

06:02.495 --> 06:03.995
What's your favorite flavor
here: cherry or grape?

06:03.997 --> 06:05.430
It's okay.
It's on the house.

06:07.701 --> 06:09.134
Cherry.

06:09.136 --> 06:12.637
Okay, but here comes
the cherry airplane.

06:12.639 --> 06:14.673
(mimics airplane sounds)

06:14.675 --> 06:16.408
Up it goes.

06:19.380 --> 06:20.912
How about some change?

06:20.914 --> 06:24.082
Sure.

06:24.084 --> 06:25.851
Sorry about that.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.119
(bills ruffle, coins clink)

06:27.121 --> 06:28.954
And here we go.

06:28.956 --> 06:30.122
(drawer closes)

06:36.797 --> 06:40.098
Oh...

06:40.100 --> 06:41.800
(touch-tone dialing)

06:41.802 --> 06:42.934
WOMAN:
911?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.736
Uh, yeah, um...

06:44.738 --> 06:46.638
The-the missing girl?
Lilly, Lilly something?

06:46.640 --> 06:48.807
Um, she's here.
She's here at my gas station.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.176
And she's, she's with a man
and he has a gun.

06:51.178 --> 06:52.844
Ma'am, are you certain
it's the child?

06:52.846 --> 06:54.446
Yes, I'm absolutely sure.

06:54.448 --> 06:55.747
She's wearing boy's clothes,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.649
and she has a birthmark
underneath her chin.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.584
Okay, ma'am,
I need you to stay calm,

06:59.586 --> 07:00.886
but if you can get
a license plate...

07:00.888 --> 07:02.821
License plate...

07:02.823 --> 07:04.556
License plate.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.691
KIRA (over P.A.):
Team One, gear up.

07:06.693 --> 07:07.859
We have a sighting
of missing child

07:07.861 --> 07:10.095
Lilly Deacon,
traveling in a car

07:10.097 --> 07:12.631
license plate: Romeo 1

07:12.633 --> 07:14.032

07:34.721 --> 07:37.155

(door opens and closes)

07:46.733 --> 07:48.800
Penny?

07:49.770 --> 07:52.170
You're home.

07:52.172 --> 07:53.939
I told you I was close.

08:00.881 --> 08:02.747
LILLY:
Hello?

08:09.056 --> 08:11.122
I want you to meet someone.

08:17.498 --> 08:19.197
Surprise.

08:20.601 --> 08:24.236
Penny, this is Lilly.

Team One, Child Services
have been notified

09:01.174 --> 09:03.308
and they're standing by;
uniform units are en route

09:03.310 --> 09:05.243
to secure the perimeter.
Copy that.

09:05.245 --> 09:07.612
Advise those units
to use radio code only.

09:07.614 --> 09:10.248
Media will be on their scanners,
and this girl's

09:10.250 --> 09:12.984
been going through
enough without all that.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.253
This guy's been
driving all night.

09:15.255 --> 09:17.022
Lilly Deacon
was abducted, what,

09:17.024 --> 09:19.024
500 miles
north of here.

09:19.026 --> 09:20.258
(siren wails in distance)

09:21.328 --> 09:23.128
You did a beautiful
job, Penny.

09:23.130 --> 09:24.663
It's clean, huh?

09:24.665 --> 09:26.331
You could eat off the floor.

09:26.333 --> 09:27.699
(bottle cap clatters)

09:27.701 --> 09:29.200
Why?

09:29.202 --> 09:31.036
Why what?

09:31.038 --> 09:33.638
Why is she here?

09:33.640 --> 09:35.040
Did I do something?

09:37.878 --> 09:40.178
Lilly...

09:40.180 --> 09:41.813
All right,
what's going on?

09:41.815 --> 09:43.982
Nothing. My son--
he sent back another letter,

09:43.984 --> 09:46.184
"return to sender,"
big surprise.

09:46.186 --> 09:48.653
You've got to see him in person.
Where...?

09:48.655 --> 09:50.355
He's in Dallas, right?

09:50.357 --> 09:52.057
You've got to go there.
It doesn't matter

09:52.059 --> 09:54.125
if they slam the door
in your face.

09:55.662 --> 09:57.729
Ah, I think I'm done, you know?

10:01.168 --> 10:04.235
Lilly... follow me.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.104
Come here.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.142
This is really special,
okay?

10:12.279 --> 10:14.145
You are very
important to me.

10:14.147 --> 10:17.048
And this is going to help
keep you safe.

10:22.189 --> 10:23.221
There.

10:23.223 --> 10:24.756
Now what do you say?

10:27.060 --> 10:30.161
What do you say when someone
gives you a present?

10:30.163 --> 10:32.230
Thank you.

10:32.232 --> 10:33.398
You're welcome.

10:33.400 --> 10:34.800
Here's how it works.

10:34.801 --> 10:36.201
You get too close
to a door or window,

10:36.203 --> 10:37.402
and you're going
to feel a little buzz.

10:37.404 --> 10:38.937
That's a warning.

10:38.939 --> 10:41.239
And what happens if we don't
pay attention to the buzz?

10:41.241 --> 10:43.074
What happens if we go
outside the house?

10:43.076 --> 10:44.643
You cross the
underground wire

10:44.645 --> 10:46.778
and the bracelet
electric-shocks you and you die.

10:46.780 --> 10:49.047
But you know what?

10:49.049 --> 10:51.182
It's better to die
than to get caught

10:51.184 --> 10:53.218
by the police 'cause
you know what happens

10:53.220 --> 10:55.420
if you caught
by the police?

10:55.422 --> 10:57.322
They'll hurt you so bad,

10:57.324 --> 10:59.357
you'll wish you were dead.

11:07.300 --> 11:08.433
11:32 a.m.

11:08.435 --> 11:10.035
Armed abduction
of a child.

11:10.037 --> 11:12.003
Subject Gerald Duglin
presumed to be in the residence

11:12.005 --> 11:13.338
at 60 Red Brick Lane

11:13.340 --> 11:15.707
with the abducted child,
Lilly Deacon.

11:15.709 --> 11:17.142
This is where
we have to stay

11:17.144 --> 11:18.343
until it's safe
to go out again.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.178
We have no choice.

11:20.180 --> 11:21.713
It's what your parents wanted.

11:21.715 --> 11:24.215
It's why they asked me
to bring you here.

11:24.217 --> 11:26.251
They didn't.

11:27.220 --> 11:29.220
Yeah, they did.

11:29.222 --> 11:31.890
Your dad and I had a long talk

11:31.892 --> 11:33.324
before we left last night.

11:33.326 --> 11:36.327
My daddy wasn't there
last night.

11:36.329 --> 11:38.463
He was in Buffalo

11:38.465 --> 11:40.165
with my grandma.

11:40.167 --> 11:41.366
We talked on the phone.

11:41.368 --> 11:43.368
Come here.

11:43.370 --> 11:45.370
First rule of the house.

11:45.372 --> 11:47.138
No talk-back.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.845
You're probably hungry, huh?

11:53.847 --> 11:56.247
That's good.
You know why?

11:56.249 --> 11:58.349
'Cause Penny's going
to make us lunch.

11:58.351 --> 11:59.417
Penny.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.890
Teenager next door confirmed

12:05.892 --> 12:07.392
Gerald's car pulled in
ten minutes ago.

12:07.394 --> 12:09.094
He didn't notice a child.

12:09.096 --> 12:11.129
As far as they know,
he has no family,

12:11.131 --> 12:13.164
no children, and he is,
quote, "quiet

12:13.166 --> 12:14.232
and keeps
to himself."

12:14.234 --> 12:16.201
Yeah, I'll bet.
You see his windows?

12:16.203 --> 12:18.970
Mm-hmm.
Every single one
frosted, shuttered.

12:18.972 --> 12:20.271
Apparently, he's a contractor.

12:20.273 --> 12:21.806
Built this whole development.

12:21.808 --> 12:23.374
Mug shot.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.977
Okay.

12:25.979 --> 12:29.447
The guy's got two priors
for sexual assault.

12:29.449 --> 12:31.483
Spent a couple
months in jail

12:31.485 --> 12:32.751
a decade ago.

12:32.753 --> 12:35.019
And he's got no weapons
registered.

12:35.021 --> 12:37.956
Except he's got one.

12:37.958 --> 12:39.290
We have to have
rules here.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.792
Rules keep us safe.

12:40.794 --> 12:43.027
It's all really,
really simple.

12:44.998 --> 12:46.998
Hey.

12:48.969 --> 12:51.970
Why don't I show you
the rest of the house?

12:51.972 --> 12:54.038
Come on.

12:55.275 --> 12:57.308
I'll take you
upstairs.

12:57.310 --> 12:58.376
Gerald...

12:58.378 --> 13:01.079
Yes, Penny?

13:02.048 --> 13:04.949
Um, let me show her around.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.285
You're making lunch.

13:07.287 --> 13:08.520
I can make it later.

13:08.522 --> 13:10.321
What?

13:10.323 --> 13:11.990
She's tired. She-she only

13:11.992 --> 13:13.124
just got here.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.326
I hear your voice
one more time...

13:15.328 --> 13:17.929
Please just let me
take care of her.

13:17.931 --> 13:19.097
Lilly, no!

13:19.099 --> 13:20.999
(bracelet buzzing)
Ow!

13:21.001 --> 13:22.567
(gasping)

13:22.569 --> 13:24.169
Hey!

13:24.171 --> 13:25.837
Lilly!

13:25.839 --> 13:28.273
Lilly, come here.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.478
(gasping)

13:34.314 --> 13:36.548
She's just scared, Gerald.

13:36.550 --> 13:38.016
Penny, get in the closet.

13:38.018 --> 13:40.185
No... Gerald, no.

13:40.187 --> 13:41.419
In the closet.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.354
Please, please,
she didn't mean it. Gerald, no!

13:43.356 --> 13:45.089
Enough. I've had enough.
No.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.991
That's enough, okay? That's it.
I've had enough of you.

13:46.993 --> 13:48.193
Okay?

14:05.345 --> 14:07.512
The mind is its own place,

14:07.514 --> 14:10.548
and in itself can make a heaven
of hell, a hell of heaven.

14:16.857 --> 14:17.856
You know what I'm gonna do?

14:17.857 --> 14:18.856
I'm gonna show you
the rest of house first.

14:18.859 --> 14:20.558
We can explore.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.560
You want to see upstairs?

14:22.562 --> 14:24.095
Come on.

14:25.365 --> 14:26.464
(beeps)

14:31.371 --> 14:32.537
(beeps)

14:35.475 --> 14:36.908
(beeps)

14:36.910 --> 14:39.477
(phone rings)

14:46.953 --> 14:48.319
(ringing continues)

14:48.321 --> 14:49.520
Come on. Pick up the phone.

14:54.427 --> 14:56.928
Hello?

14:56.930 --> 14:59.030
Hello, Mr. Duglin?

14:59.032 --> 15:01.032
This is Sergeant
Gregory Parker,

15:01.034 --> 15:03.034
with the Police Strategic
Response Unit.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.937
Am I speaking
with Gerald Duglin?

15:08.275 --> 15:10.108
Mr. Duglin, a little girl
has been abducted

15:10.110 --> 15:11.342
and we have reason to believe

15:11.344 --> 15:12.577
that she's inside your house.

15:12.579 --> 15:14.012
Now if you
and the other occupants

15:14.014 --> 15:15.580
can please exit,

15:15.582 --> 15:17.549
we can start talking

15:17.550 --> 15:19.517
about how you can safely return
Lilly to her parents.

15:19.519 --> 15:21.085
If you're interested
in her safety,

15:21.087 --> 15:22.921
then you stay out of my house.

15:22.923 --> 15:24.355
You step one foot
in this house,

15:24.357 --> 15:26.357
and I swear to God
I will kill her

15:26.359 --> 15:28.426
and I will take you down.

15:30.430 --> 15:33.264
(phone rings)

15:42.709 --> 15:45.443
(ringing continues)

15:45.445 --> 15:46.978
(gasping):
No!

15:46.980 --> 15:48.279
It's time.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.314
They're here.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.115
You know what to do.

15:52.085 --> 15:54.352
I know what to do.

16:00.560 --> 16:03.027
Come on. Pick up the phone.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.030
(ringing continues)

16:06.032 --> 16:07.665
Like we practiced,
like I showed you.

16:07.667 --> 16:09.133
What's happening?
Shh!

16:09.135 --> 16:10.268
They've come, okay.

16:10.270 --> 16:11.569
Who?
Who's come?
Don't worry.

16:11.571 --> 16:13.104
I'll protect you.
Come on.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.605
Quick, Penny.

16:14.607 --> 16:16.140
(ringing continues)

16:16.142 --> 16:17.675
Okay, take that.
Take that.

16:17.676 --> 16:19.209
Well, you're staying
with us though...
Shh, shh, shh.

16:19.212 --> 16:20.345
We're going to need
more ammo, okay?

16:20.347 --> 16:21.312
We've got more
in the basement.

16:21.314 --> 16:22.447
No, we don't have any time.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.681
I'll be right back.
Two minutes.

16:23.683 --> 16:26.250
I'll be right back.
I promise.

16:26.252 --> 16:28.386
(ringing continues)

16:28.388 --> 16:31.622
Without you, no life. Okay?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.193
(sobbing):
No.

16:35.195 --> 16:37.261
Let me come with you.

16:38.732 --> 16:40.264
No!
Gerald! Gerald!

16:40.266 --> 16:42.300
Please don't leave me!

16:42.302 --> 16:44.219
LEWIS:
11:43 a.m.

16:44.220 --> 16:46.137
First telephone contact
terminated by subject.

16:46.139 --> 16:48.306
Threats uttered to hostage
and police units.

16:48.308 --> 16:49.607
All right.

16:49.609 --> 16:51.309
He's not reestablishing.

16:51.311 --> 16:52.210
Hey, Ed?

16:52.212 --> 16:53.344
Holding in position.

16:53.346 --> 16:54.445
I can't reestablish.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.480
If you go in...

16:55.482 --> 16:56.614
Dangerous for the girl,

16:56.616 --> 16:57.648
but if we don't go in...

16:57.650 --> 16:59.384
Dangerous for the girl.

16:59.386 --> 17:01.619
Copy that.

17:01.621 --> 17:03.788
Spike, head to white,
keep your eyes on the front.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.456
Copy that.

17:05.458 --> 17:08.526
(hip hop music playing)

17:10.230 --> 17:13.297
(increases car stereo volume)

17:18.238 --> 17:21.205
ED:
We're in the garage.

17:21.207 --> 17:23.274
Help me.
Help me tip the table.

17:26.179 --> 17:27.478
Close the door.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.480
We can't.
He's coming back.

17:29.482 --> 17:32.316
How long do we have
to stay in here?

17:32.318 --> 17:35.353
As long as it takes.

17:40.493 --> 17:42.360
SAM:
Garage door breached.

17:48.134 --> 17:49.400
Entry clear.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.797
Kitchen's clear.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.798
Boss,

18:20.800 --> 18:23.434
table's set for three.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.619
Clear.

18:24.620 --> 18:25.803
(whispering):
Living room's clear.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.774
He saw us coming.

18:29.776 --> 18:31.776
Sarge.

18:31.778 --> 18:34.679
I'm looking at a box
for an electric dog collar.

18:34.681 --> 18:36.714
PARKER:
He might have a containment
around the house.

18:36.716 --> 18:38.249
So let's cut the circuit.

18:38.251 --> 18:39.517
First floor clear.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.697
(cocking shotgun)

18:57.470 --> 18:59.537
(clattering)

19:01.474 --> 19:03.541
We got something
downstairs.

19:19.759 --> 19:21.526
We got eyes.

19:29.769 --> 19:32.370
Okay, we've got Lilly Deacon
with another

19:32.372 --> 19:35.406
young woman, approximately
16 years of age in...

19:36.543 --> 19:38.543
...looks like
the master bedroom.

19:38.545 --> 19:39.877
No sign of Duglin.

19:39.879 --> 19:41.245
Let's transmit that

19:41.247 --> 19:43.247
to Kira, see if she can ID
that other girl.

19:43.249 --> 19:45.316
Possible accomplice.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.384
Hey, Sam, can you get
another angle of the bedroom?

19:47.387 --> 19:48.553
See if Duglin's in there?

19:48.555 --> 19:51.422
Copy that.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.795
He's not in there, boss.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.766
Boss, Lilly's upstairs, correct?

20:01.768 --> 20:03.768
That's affirmative.

20:03.770 --> 20:05.236
Where are you?

20:05.238 --> 20:06.404
Basement steps.

20:06.406 --> 20:08.506
Police Strategic
Response Unit!

20:08.508 --> 20:09.941
Police! Get down!
Weapons on the ground!

20:09.943 --> 20:11.876
Police!
Hands in the air!
Weapons on the ground!

20:11.878 --> 20:12.977
Let me see your hands!

20:15.348 --> 20:18.416
Looks like somebody's
been transcribing a book.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.318
By hand.

20:21.254 --> 20:22.720
<i>Paradise Lost.</i>

20:22.722 --> 20:24.605
Milton.

20:24.606 --> 20:26.489
Adam and Eve in Paradise.
Good stuff.

20:26.492 --> 20:29.560
Fire and brimstone,
my dad's kind of book.

20:31.497 --> 20:33.364
How long have you
lived here?

20:33.366 --> 20:34.899
A long time.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.702
Don't you ever
want to go home?

20:39.639 --> 20:42.006
Get down.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.808
Guys, she's armed.

20:43.810 --> 20:46.010
(blasting)

20:46.980 --> 20:48.546
Yes, she is.

20:48.548 --> 20:50.548
Camera's down.

20:50.550 --> 20:52.350
All right, stand by
for immediate action.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.118
Let's get up closer
to the house.

20:54.119 --> 20:55.885
We're on the move. We're
gonna need two units lead us up.

20:55.888 --> 20:57.555
Eddie, check in. Where are you?

20:57.557 --> 20:59.523
Boss, I don't know
how he did it,

20:59.525 --> 21:00.858
but he's completely
disappeared.

21:00.860 --> 21:02.526
We lost him.

21:02.528 --> 21:03.894
Go careful.
Duglin's not upstairs.

21:03.896 --> 21:05.296
We're on the move.

21:06.266 --> 21:07.598
You heard that, right?

21:07.600 --> 21:10.468
It's like a... like
a scraping sound or...

21:10.470 --> 21:13.638
Ed, look at these marks
on the floor.

21:13.640 --> 21:15.439
Go, go, go.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.942
Sarge, we found a tunnel.

21:18.878 --> 21:21.279
We're going in.

21:21.281 --> 21:23.481
Okay, you go for it,
but keep me posted.

21:30.056 --> 21:32.323
Sarge, I think I got a match
on your girl.

21:32.325 --> 21:33.357
I'm sending it through now.

21:33.359 --> 21:34.592
PARKER:
Rap sheet, any priors?

21:34.594 --> 21:36.294
No, sir, found her
in Missing Persons.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.329
Matches an aged-up picture
of Penny Westler.

21:38.331 --> 21:39.897
Who?

21:39.898 --> 21:41.464
Missing child
taken from her own backyard

21:41.467 --> 21:43.634
eight years ago:
stranger abduction.

21:43.636 --> 21:45.403
No arrest made.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.871
Oh, my God.

21:46.873 --> 21:48.806
She must be 17 by now.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.616
(siren blaring)

22:06.959 --> 22:09.894
PARKER (over radio):
Okay, team, subject is on foot.

22:09.896 --> 22:11.929
Constables Lane and Wordsworth
are in pursuit.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.497
We've got the neighborhood
contained.

22:13.499 --> 22:16.100
We need to get this
under control now.

22:19.339 --> 22:20.871
We're in front of the house now.

22:20.873 --> 22:22.907
Change of plans:
we're gonna talk this girl down.

22:22.909 --> 22:25.409
Jules, I want you to do it.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.044
Oh, Sarge,
if you're right,

22:27.046 --> 22:30.514
this girl's been in here,
like, eight years.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.517
We're dealing with some
serious Stockholm syndrome.

22:33.519 --> 22:35.619
She probably doesn't even know
who she is anymore.

22:35.621 --> 22:37.588
I know, and my bet,
he's conditioned her

22:37.590 --> 22:40.091
to fear the police,
and that's why she's firing.

22:40.093 --> 22:41.892
Now, you're gonna be fine.

22:41.894 --> 22:44.061
This girl has spent eight years
in captivity

22:44.063 --> 22:45.563
at the hands of a man.

22:45.565 --> 22:47.732
What she needs now
is a female voice.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.500
All right, we're starting
at ground zero.

22:49.502 --> 22:52.103
I mean, I... I don't know
if I know how to do this.

22:53.139 --> 22:55.506
All right, I'm coming in.

22:55.508 --> 22:57.408
Okay, wait.

22:58.811 --> 23:00.511
Can you help me
with the Stockholm?

23:01.481 --> 23:04.081
Yeah.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.050
Now, the first thing
to remember...

23:06.052 --> 23:07.885
there will be nothing simple

23:07.887 --> 23:09.987
about her feelings
for her captor.

23:09.989 --> 23:13.958
Just follow the same rules
as always: connect, respect...

23:13.960 --> 23:15.426
Protect. Okay.

23:15.428 --> 23:17.495
Okay, just keep it simple.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.764
By now, Penny's
got a belief system

23:19.766 --> 23:22.500
that has helped her survive
whatever it is she survived,

23:22.502 --> 23:24.402
and it's not your job
to tear that down.

23:24.404 --> 23:27.071
It's your job to get these
two girls out of there safely,

23:27.073 --> 23:29.039
and I'm gonna stay right here
and be your second

23:29.041 --> 23:31.542
inside your ear the whole time,
all right?

23:32.512 --> 23:34.312
Copy.

23:34.313 --> 23:36.113
Spike, you go with Sam;
you cover Jules.

23:39.018 --> 23:41.018
Lou, we need to track down
Penny's parents.

23:41.020 --> 23:43.120
Get them here fast, but I
need to talk to them first.

23:43.122 --> 23:44.488
Copy.
Eddie,

23:44.490 --> 23:45.556
what's your 20?

23:45.558 --> 23:47.191
We're in a tunnel heading west.

23:47.193 --> 23:49.827
Okay, stay on it.

23:49.829 --> 23:51.662
Kira, you want
to map this out for us,

23:51.664 --> 23:53.531
tell us where the hell we are?

24:02.642 --> 24:03.741
He's up ahead.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.543
Go, go, go.

24:06.479 --> 24:08.579
Hey, girls, my name is Jules.

24:08.581 --> 24:10.648
PARKER:
Slow down, Jules.

24:10.650 --> 24:12.983
Just work
against the adrenaline.

24:12.985 --> 24:15.152
Your names are Penny and Lilly.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.154
Is that right?

24:18.858 --> 24:21.625
Well, I'm a police officer,

24:21.627 --> 24:23.494
and I'm here to
help you both.

24:23.496 --> 24:26.530
You know, I'd really like
to open these doors

24:26.532 --> 24:29.099
so that we can
speak easier.

24:30.036 --> 24:31.101
Is that okay?

24:35.508 --> 24:37.541
All right, I'm opening the door,

24:37.543 --> 24:41.779
but I promise you, I'm gonna
stay back here, all right?

24:42.715 --> 24:46.050
Penny, is that right?

24:46.052 --> 24:47.852
The little girl
that you have with you,

24:47.854 --> 24:50.087
her name is Lilly Deacon,

24:50.089 --> 24:52.256
and I'm really hoping
that we can return her

24:52.258 --> 24:54.258
safely to her mom
and dad.

24:55.862 --> 24:57.161
Can we can work that out?

24:57.163 --> 24:59.063
Can you help us out with that?

24:59.065 --> 25:00.030
Get away from us!

25:00.032 --> 25:02.099
(shotgun blasting)

25:02.101 --> 25:03.200
PARKER:
Team status-- everybody.

25:03.202 --> 25:04.768
No harm.

25:04.770 --> 25:06.270
No harm, no harm.
No harm.

25:07.206 --> 25:09.039
(panting)

25:09.041 --> 25:10.274
Sarge?

25:10.276 --> 25:12.176
De-escalate, Jules, de-escalate.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.044
Whatever Penny's world was
an hour ago,

25:14.046 --> 25:15.813
it's a whole lot
more confusing now,

25:15.815 --> 25:18.516
so just... just keep doing
what you're doing.

25:18.518 --> 25:21.018
Just stay covered.

25:21.954 --> 25:24.121
How do they know my name?
Shh.

25:24.123 --> 25:25.956
Everything they say is a lie.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.035
Penny?

25:38.037 --> 25:40.137
I know that you
are very scared right now.

25:40.139 --> 25:42.172
I mean, you've
got a gun with you.

25:43.876 --> 25:46.110
And guns are always scary.

25:46.112 --> 25:49.980
But I...
but I really believe

25:49.982 --> 25:51.282
that you don't want
to hurt anyone.

25:51.284 --> 25:53.150
I really believe that, Penny.

25:53.152 --> 25:55.686
So what do you think?

25:55.688 --> 25:58.756
What do you think?
Can we get rid of the gun?

25:58.758 --> 26:01.592
So that we can talk
without being scared?

26:03.029 --> 26:05.696
Penny, if you and Lilly
don't say anything,

26:05.698 --> 26:07.231
how am I gonna know
that you're okay?

26:07.233 --> 26:08.332
Leave us alone!

26:08.334 --> 26:10.100
Gerald?

26:10.102 --> 26:12.102
Gerald!

26:12.104 --> 26:13.904
What did you do to him?

26:15.942 --> 26:17.041
Okay, okay, okay... Sergeant,

26:17.043 --> 26:18.309
I got Penny's parents
on the line.

26:18.311 --> 26:19.944
Squad car's got them en route.

26:19.946 --> 26:21.245
Jules, Jules,
you're doing great.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.113
That's great news.
She made her first request.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.849
She wants to know
about Gerald, okay?

26:25.851 --> 26:29.219
So remember, just take
your time, slow it down,

26:29.221 --> 26:32.222
and get her to yellow.

26:32.223 --> 26:35.224
Penny, I know that you want
Lilly and Gerald to be safe.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.928
So you know what...

26:37.930 --> 26:39.964
you know
what I'm gonna do?

26:40.900 --> 26:42.199
I'm gonna find out for you.

26:42.201 --> 26:45.269
I'm gonna see where he is
and how he's doing.

26:47.073 --> 26:48.906
'Cause I think
the guys I work with,

26:48.908 --> 26:49.974
they might know.

26:50.943 --> 26:53.277
Do you want me to ask?

26:55.147 --> 26:56.347
Yeah.

26:57.316 --> 26:58.782
Okay.

27:03.155 --> 27:04.989
Guys, any word on Duglin?

27:04.991 --> 27:08.325
Guy tapped into some
tunnel system in the basement.

27:08.327 --> 27:10.060
Guy knows what he's doing.

27:14.300 --> 27:18.202
Kira, we're in a tunnel
with railroad tracks.

27:18.204 --> 27:20.170
Where are we?

27:21.240 --> 27:23.641
Brickworks--
whole subdivision used to be

27:23.643 --> 27:24.908
a brick factory.

27:24.910 --> 27:27.211
Red Brick Lane, Kiln Avenue...

27:27.213 --> 27:28.812
What's up ahead?

27:28.814 --> 27:30.848
Which way you going?

27:30.850 --> 27:32.783
Still heading west.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.084
(typing)

27:34.086 --> 27:36.020
Westbound, tunnel ends
in a warehouse.

27:36.022 --> 27:37.888
You're gonna have
to go up a level.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.891
Where is he?

27:40.893 --> 27:42.292
Where is he?

27:43.663 --> 27:45.863
(gunshot)

27:55.207 --> 27:57.374
Mrs. Westler, Mr. Westler,

27:57.376 --> 28:00.044
I'm Greg Parker.
We spoke on the phone.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.278
Where is she?

28:01.280 --> 28:02.980
She's in that house,
but we need

28:02.982 --> 28:04.982
to be incredibly
patient here.

28:04.984 --> 28:07.317
We haven't seen our
daughter in eight years.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.053
You can't imagine...

28:09.055 --> 28:12.790
I understand, but Penny's exit
from that house

28:12.792 --> 28:15.259
has to be on her terms,
at her pace.

28:15.261 --> 28:17.294
If she's rushed
in any way,

28:17.296 --> 28:19.430
she may freeze up,
she may escalate.

28:19.432 --> 28:22.099
The only way we can get your
daughter out of there safely

28:22.101 --> 28:24.301
is if we help her choose
to come out.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.105
She seems nice.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.940
Why can't we just go?

28:29.942 --> 28:32.876
Because... they'll capture us,

28:32.878 --> 28:35.813
and what happens
after that is...

28:35.815 --> 28:37.748
What?

28:37.750 --> 28:39.283
What?

28:39.285 --> 28:41.418
It's complicated.

28:41.420 --> 28:43.320
Have you heard of Anne Frank?

28:44.290 --> 28:45.956
She was a
little girl

28:45.958 --> 28:48.892
who lived with her family
in an attic for years

28:48.894 --> 28:51.195
waiting for it to be safe
to go outside

28:51.197 --> 28:53.764
because bad people
were in charge,

28:53.766 --> 28:55.232
and they sent
police in

28:55.234 --> 28:58.068
to drag people away
to barbwire prisons.

28:58.070 --> 29:00.337
It was just like hell,
but on earth.

29:00.339 --> 29:06.076
Like devils and fire
and people burning?

29:06.078 --> 29:07.377
Exactly.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.047
So that's just like now.

29:10.049 --> 29:15.219
So we have to be brave and wait
for Gerald to come back for us.

29:19.258 --> 29:21.024
JULES:
Penny, I found out
about Gerald.

29:21.026 --> 29:22.159
Do you want to hear?

29:23.329 --> 29:25.462
Yeah.

29:26.465 --> 29:28.766
Okay, well, this might sound
kind of funny, but we...

29:28.768 --> 29:30.067
we don't know where he is.

29:31.036 --> 29:32.436
No.

29:32.438 --> 29:34.538
No, you've captured him.

29:34.540 --> 29:36.940
You had the house
surrounded; we saw it

29:36.942 --> 29:38.375
on the alarm screens;
you surrounded us.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.512
I know... I know that this seems
impossible, but he left.

29:41.514 --> 29:43.080
No, he wouldn't leave.

29:43.082 --> 29:44.815
Penny,
I promise you.

29:44.816 --> 29:46.549
There's a tunnel that leads
out of the basement.

29:46.552 --> 29:47.918
You're making fun of me?

29:47.920 --> 29:48.952
No, I'm not.

29:48.954 --> 29:51.155
Penny, I would not
make fun of you.

29:51.157 --> 29:53.090
I know
that you're waiting

29:53.092 --> 29:54.542
for Gerald to come back.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.993
I can tell that you care
a lot about him.

29:55.995 --> 29:58.195
"So dear I love him
that with him all deaths

29:58.197 --> 29:59.530
I could endure,
without him no life."

29:59.532 --> 30:01.498
It's from the book.

30:02.434 --> 30:04.201
(sobbing)

30:06.405 --> 30:08.472
(sobbing):
He's gone. He's gone.

30:08.474 --> 30:10.207
He's gone.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.341
Penny?

30:11.343 --> 30:12.442
Shh, it's okay.

30:12.444 --> 30:14.845
It's gonna be okay...

30:14.847 --> 30:16.146
It's gonna be okay.

30:16.148 --> 30:17.481
I want to go home.

30:17.483 --> 30:20.450
No, no, no, no.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.586
I want to see
my mommy and daddy.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.822
No, they sent you here
to be safe.

30:24.824 --> 30:26.523
No, they... they didn't.

30:26.525 --> 30:27.991
He made that up.

30:29.461 --> 30:31.128
I'm going home.

30:31.130 --> 30:33.497
No, Lilly, what are you doing?

30:34.867 --> 30:37.534
I want to go home... now.

30:37.536 --> 30:39.169
Sarge, Lilly wants
to come out.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.382
No, you can't walk out there.

30:52.384 --> 30:53.517
They're going to send you
to prison.

30:53.519 --> 30:54.952
Lilly,

30:54.954 --> 30:56.854
we're not going to hurt you,
I'm promise you

30:56.856 --> 30:58.388
on my life.
We're not going to hurt you.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.424
Lilly, you can't walk out there.

31:00.426 --> 31:01.925
Lilly,
your mom and dad--

31:01.927 --> 31:03.560
they're on a plane.

31:03.562 --> 31:04.995
They're coming in
from Sault Sainte Marie.

31:04.997 --> 31:06.530
They're so excited
to see you.

31:06.532 --> 31:07.998
I'm going home.

31:08.000 --> 31:09.283
Lilly!

31:09.284 --> 31:10.567
I won't let them
take you away!

31:10.569 --> 31:12.035
(gasping)

31:19.178 --> 31:20.944
What's going on, guys?

31:20.946 --> 31:22.412
Penny's holding her gun
on Lilly.

31:22.414 --> 31:24.114
She thinks Lilly's
going into a trap.

31:24.116 --> 31:26.033
Jules, I don't
have eyes in.

31:26.034 --> 31:27.951
This is your call, but if Penny
is threatening Lilly...

31:27.953 --> 31:29.186
She's not going to hurt her.

31:34.660 --> 31:36.360
Jules, stand down.

31:36.362 --> 31:38.595
The little girl's the priority.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.297
Sam?
I have it.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.498
She's not going to hurt her.

31:41.500 --> 31:42.466
Lilly?

31:42.468 --> 31:43.634
Stay here.

31:43.636 --> 31:44.952
Penny,

31:44.953 --> 31:46.269
we're not going to take Lilly
anywhere,

31:46.272 --> 31:47.671
unless she chooses to go.

31:47.673 --> 31:48.972
There is no choice.

31:48.974 --> 31:50.207
That's what
the book says.

31:50.209 --> 31:52.542
Okay, I didn't read that book,
Penny.

31:52.544 --> 31:54.912
But this what I know
about choice.

31:54.914 --> 31:56.380
Okay?

31:56.382 --> 31:57.614
Gerald made
a choice today.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.082
He chose
to leave you.

31:59.084 --> 32:01.585
And Lilly--
Lilly's making a choice.

32:01.587 --> 32:04.254
She wants to see
her mom and dad.

32:04.256 --> 32:06.256
And you made an amazing choice.

32:06.258 --> 32:08.292
The most amazing choice.

32:08.294 --> 32:10.460
Because you just met
this little girl,

32:10.462 --> 32:11.495
and you're
protecting her,

32:11.497 --> 32:13.630
and not everybody
would do that.

32:13.632 --> 32:15.666
Penny,

32:15.668 --> 32:18.602
please, let her choose.

32:19.672 --> 32:22.606
(softly):
Please.

32:24.710 --> 32:26.977
She's not going
to hurt her.

32:27.947 --> 32:28.946
Lilly?!

32:28.948 --> 32:30.013
Don't go outside!

32:30.015 --> 32:31.281
You'll cross
the underground wire...

32:31.283 --> 32:33.483
Penny, she's going to be fine.

32:33.485 --> 32:35.252
We cut the wire.

32:35.254 --> 32:38.588
Why don't you look
for yourself.

32:38.590 --> 32:40.657
Why don't you look
out the window, Penny.

32:43.162 --> 32:45.228
Sam, hold off.

32:46.966 --> 32:48.265
Lilly?

32:48.267 --> 32:50.000
I have the solution.

33:00.379 --> 33:02.346
Lilly, it's okay.

33:02.348 --> 33:04.381
Okay, right down
the stairs, okay?

33:04.383 --> 33:05.983
There you go.
That's great. Good, good.

33:05.985 --> 33:08.485
All right?

33:08.487 --> 33:10.387
Right over here,
okay?

33:10.389 --> 33:11.688
You're going to be okay.

33:11.690 --> 33:14.057
(Lilly crying)

33:14.059 --> 33:16.159
You're going
to be fine.

33:26.739 --> 33:29.373
Ed.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.010
That's a revolver, right?

33:33.012 --> 33:35.212
Six in a chamber,
that's number three.

33:35.748 --> 33:37.547
Four.

33:38.617 --> 33:40.617
Five.

33:40.619 --> 33:43.387
Where's six?
Where's six? Where's six?

33:49.595 --> 33:51.695
Penny!

33:51.697 --> 33:53.363
Penny!

33:53.365 --> 33:54.231
Oh, my God.

34:00.039 --> 34:01.138
You got it?

34:01.140 --> 34:03.573
I got it.

34:06.078 --> 34:07.811
Gerald, it's over.

34:09.782 --> 34:11.615
Just put the gun down

34:11.617 --> 34:13.350
and come down
those steps.

34:13.352 --> 34:15.152
Hands in the air.

34:15.154 --> 34:16.486
Hands where we can see 'em.

34:16.488 --> 34:17.387
Stop!

34:17.389 --> 34:19.322
Okay? Just stop.

34:19.324 --> 34:22.092
ED:
All right,
it's up to you.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.427
Just put the gun down
and come down

34:23.429 --> 34:24.594
or we will come
in there.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.396
You have five seconds.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.165
You don't understand.

34:28.167 --> 34:29.199
No one does.

34:29.201 --> 34:32.069
Explain it to me, Gerald.

34:32.071 --> 34:35.072
This isn't what I wanted.

34:35.074 --> 34:36.239
Yeah?

34:36.241 --> 34:37.574
What did you want?

34:37.576 --> 34:40.343
To be happy.

34:40.345 --> 34:42.379
Just like anybody else.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.182
You're not like everybody else,
Gerald.

34:46.852 --> 34:48.718
Put the gun down.

34:48.720 --> 34:50.821
(sighs)

34:50.823 --> 34:52.856
I can't.

34:52.858 --> 34:55.125
Without her no life.

35:00.165 --> 35:02.232
(gunshot)

35:03.402 --> 35:06.203
There's six.

35:08.273 --> 35:10.407
Jules...
It's okay.

35:10.409 --> 35:12.476
Penny.

35:14.279 --> 35:16.279
Thank you

35:16.281 --> 35:18.648
for letting Lilly choose.

35:18.650 --> 35:23.153
He said I'd die
if I left the house.

35:23.155 --> 35:25.355
Penny...

35:25.357 --> 35:26.823
No.

35:26.825 --> 35:28.792
No! You have him.

35:28.794 --> 35:31.895
We don't. We don't.
You have him
and he isn't coming back!

35:31.897 --> 35:33.296
We don't. We do not have him.

35:33.298 --> 35:34.865
No! Without him no life!

35:34.867 --> 35:36.867
(sobbing)
Okay, Penny.

35:36.869 --> 35:38.268
Penny, please.

35:38.270 --> 35:39.302
Please.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.804
Two minutes.

35:40.806 --> 35:42.305
That's what he said.

35:42.307 --> 35:43.540
He said two minutes.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.808
He promised.

35:44.810 --> 35:45.842
He said he was coming back.

35:45.844 --> 35:48.778
(sobbing)

35:48.780 --> 35:50.914
It's not true, is it?

35:52.351 --> 35:54.384
He isn't coming back, is he?

35:54.386 --> 35:55.852
SAM:
Sarge, she's got her gun
on Jules.

35:55.854 --> 35:58.155
Jules, you gotta control
this thing.

35:58.157 --> 35:59.222
I have the solution.

35:59.224 --> 36:00.390
Copy that, Sam.

36:00.392 --> 36:01.925
Your call. It's your call.

36:01.927 --> 36:04.628
No. Please.

36:04.630 --> 36:06.196
JULES:
Sarge, you gotta let me do this.

36:06.198 --> 36:07.297
She's going to be okay.

36:10.202 --> 36:11.801
Okay, Penny,

36:11.803 --> 36:14.804
I want to help you go home.

36:14.806 --> 36:17.541
I want to help you remember

36:17.543 --> 36:19.576
the girl that you used to be.

36:19.578 --> 36:21.578
Good thinking, Jules.

36:21.580 --> 36:22.879
I'll get the mother on it.

36:22.881 --> 36:24.748
Feed her memories.

36:24.750 --> 36:27.284
Sarah, I need you
to tell us about your child.

36:27.286 --> 36:28.752
Any time that she felt

36:28.754 --> 36:32.222
joy or safe or loved
or thrilled or anything.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.257
I remember the snowstorm
in the country.

36:34.259 --> 36:36.793
We were walking, uh, trying
to get to the house.

36:36.795 --> 36:38.461
There was a snowstorm.

36:38.463 --> 36:39.930
You and your parents.

36:39.932 --> 36:41.298
And then we lost her.

36:41.300 --> 36:42.799
Remember we couldn't find her?

36:42.801 --> 36:44.501
And my heart was pounding.

36:44.503 --> 36:46.970
Only for a minute
they-they couldn't see you

36:46.972 --> 36:48.438
because of all the snow.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.773
Yeah, and then we did.

36:49.775 --> 36:51.808
We scooped up Pips,
and we took her home.

36:51.810 --> 36:53.810
And you got
to stay up late.

36:53.812 --> 36:55.812
Do you remember that?

36:55.814 --> 36:57.214
And they gave you
three desserts.

36:57.216 --> 36:58.899
Oh, mosquito netting.

36:58.900 --> 37:00.583
She used to have it over
her bed like a canopy.

37:00.586 --> 37:02.319
A canopy that was
like a tent.

37:02.321 --> 37:04.354
And there were all these
stuffed animals underneath.

37:04.356 --> 37:05.989
The telescope she got
when she turned nine--

37:05.991 --> 37:07.591
it's still there;
it's still in her room.

37:07.593 --> 37:09.559
Man, I wanted a
telescope so bad

37:09.561 --> 37:11.428
when I was a kid.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.929
Saturn.

37:12.931 --> 37:14.898
I don't even know where that is,

37:14.900 --> 37:16.967
but I guess you do.

37:18.270 --> 37:20.337
'Cause that's what your parents
are saying.

37:22.441 --> 37:24.941
They're right
outside, Penny.

37:24.943 --> 37:26.276
They're right outside.

37:26.278 --> 37:28.345
They're waiting for you.

37:30.282 --> 37:32.282
Come on, Pips.

37:32.284 --> 37:34.351
Come on.

37:35.721 --> 37:38.421
Come on, Pips.

37:38.423 --> 37:41.458
(under breath):
Pip...

37:41.460 --> 37:43.526
Pip-squeak?

37:44.863 --> 37:46.896
That's what that
means, right?

37:46.898 --> 37:48.265
Yes.

37:48.267 --> 37:50.834
That's what that means.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.836
I know you're really
scared, Penny.

37:52.838 --> 37:53.970
I know.

37:53.972 --> 37:55.639
I totally understand.

37:55.641 --> 37:57.641
But outside--

37:57.643 --> 37:59.643
that great big world--

37:59.645 --> 38:02.846
it's even prettier
than the one in your room.

38:06.785 --> 38:08.818
It's your choice.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.820
It's your choice.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.889
It's up to you.

38:16.395 --> 38:18.928
Yes?

38:18.930 --> 38:20.897
(drops rifle)

38:21.867 --> 38:23.867
Yeah.

38:23.869 --> 38:25.035
Okay.

38:25.037 --> 38:27.337
You're safe.

38:27.339 --> 38:29.406
They're outside.

38:32.377 --> 38:34.444
They're right outside.

38:51.096 --> 38:53.096
On her time.

38:53.098 --> 38:54.764
Her time.

39:22.060 --> 39:24.861
PARKER:
Let her come to you.

39:53.525 --> 39:55.558
¶ ¶

39:58.997 --> 40:01.998
Julianna Callaghan,
you made me proud.

40:02.000 --> 40:05.001
Yeah, and I wasn't
even perfect.

40:05.003 --> 40:07.003
No, you weren't.
(both chuckle)

40:07.005 --> 40:09.172
You were human.
That's what those girls needed.

40:09.174 --> 40:12.175
That's what they both needed
to get out safe.

40:12.177 --> 40:14.177
Screwing up
and being human.

40:14.179 --> 40:16.179
My biggest fear.

40:16.181 --> 40:19.182
Copy that.

40:19.184 --> 40:21.184
Look what happened.

40:21.186 --> 40:23.853
Planets aligned.
It was a good day.

40:23.855 --> 40:25.188
Right?

40:25.190 --> 40:26.856
You coming for a drink?
I'm buying.

40:26.858 --> 40:28.024
Nah.

40:28.026 --> 40:30.026
Actually, I'm going
to go do something.

40:30.028 --> 40:32.028
But I'll see you Monday?

40:32.030 --> 40:33.163
Yeah.

40:33.165 --> 40:34.864
Yep.

40:34.866 --> 40:36.933
Right.

40:44.509 --> 40:47.010
Your e-ticket
and credit card.

40:47.012 --> 40:49.012
Better hurry.
It's the last flight.

40:49.014 --> 40:51.147
Dallas.

40:51.149 --> 40:53.616
Long way to go
for two days.

40:53.618 --> 40:56.686
Not as long
as it took me to do this.

41:19.177 --> 41:21.878
This one's
for focus, right?

41:21.880 --> 41:23.213
Yeah.

41:23.215 --> 41:25.482
Yeah, that's for focus.

41:38.196 --> 41:39.963
Dad.

41:44.069 --> 41:47.103
The stars--
they're still there.
