00:54.763 --> 00:56.064
Let's go.

00:56.066 --> 01:00.201
Wait, wait, wait.
Can we go, just the two of us?

01:00.203 --> 01:03.805
Look, if this is gonna work,
you two need to get along.

01:03.807 --> 01:05.606
She doesn't like me.

01:05.608 --> 01:08.376
Well, it takes effort
from both sides.

01:11.313 --> 01:15.683
She's had a hard time lately,
that's all I'm saying.

01:15.685 --> 01:18.453
Come on, you know I didn't
mean anything by it.

01:18.455 --> 01:20.521
Just come.

01:22.624 --> 01:24.792
OK.

01:24.794 --> 01:27.195
But you're gonna
make it up to me later.

01:27.197 --> 01:30.698
OK, I will.
I mean with dinner... out.

01:31.733 --> 01:33.701
Yeah, OK.

01:39.741 --> 01:44.445
Look at how many of you there are.
Oh, cool.

01:44.447 --> 01:46.747
You think all the you's are
thinking the same thing?

01:46.749 --> 01:49.217
Yeah, they're thinking,
"Get me out of this TV."

01:49.219 --> 01:50.551
I can't believe you're
doing homework.

01:50.553 --> 01:54.589
AP classes.
Um, you girls better clean up.

01:54.591 --> 01:57.658
Emmy, get ready.
We're leaving in a half.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.728
Is she going?
Yes, she's going.

02:00.730 --> 02:04.432
Can't I just stay here?
We're leaving in a half.

02:05.367 --> 02:08.436
She's so fake.
She seems nice.

02:08.437 --> 02:10.304
Yeah, too nice.

02:10.306 --> 02:12.573
Yeah, well, at least
she leaves you alone.

02:12.575 --> 02:16.611
My step-mom always wants to hang out,
even bribes me with wine coolers.

02:16.613 --> 02:17.845
It's pitiful.

02:20.916 --> 02:23.784
This is actually a really
good price for 70 acres.

02:23.786 --> 02:25.887
We foreclosed on this
house eight months ago.

02:25.889 --> 02:29.657
It's only now just coming on the market.
That's sad.

02:29.659 --> 02:32.927
It's not so sad.
It had to go to somebody.

02:32.929 --> 02:36.764
OK, peeps.
Lunch?

02:36.766 --> 02:41.736
Lunch, for sure.
OK, I see how it is.

02:41.738 --> 02:44.172
Ah, well, at least we
agreed on something.

02:44.174 --> 02:47.175
Yes, we do... at last.

03:08.830 --> 03:13.334
Well, what do we think?
Got anything else?

03:39.695 --> 03:42.330
Jesus, man, you shouldn't
sneak up on people.

03:42.332 --> 03:44.498
Sorry about that.

03:44.500 --> 03:46.801
Not too keen on the
neighborhood, huh?

03:46.803 --> 03:48.002
Not really.

03:48.004 --> 03:52.573
Well, I don't blame you.
It's pre-fab crap around here.

03:52.575 --> 03:56.410
You live around here?
Me? No, no, no, no.

03:56.412 --> 04:00.281
Is that your son?
Yeah.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.817
You know, you look like a
man who needs some space.

04:02.819 --> 04:06.387
You know, a place you can
really stretch your legs.

04:06.389 --> 04:09.657
What if I told you
I had just the place?

04:09.659 --> 04:11.025
I should have figured you were
trying to sell something.

04:11.027 --> 04:14.528
You a realtor?
No, no, this is my place.

04:14.530 --> 04:18.632
The open house is today.
70 acres.

04:18.635 --> 04:23.304
It's a real escape from the world.
70 acres?

04:23.306 --> 04:25.673
That's a deal for 70 acres.
What's the catch?

04:25.675 --> 04:28.042
Oh, there's no strings attached.

04:28.044 --> 04:31.345
You just have to really want it.

04:31.347 --> 04:36.050
I'll hope to see you there.
Come on, Ollie.

04:43.759 --> 04:47.628
So, Em, want to go
shopping tomorrow?

04:49.598 --> 04:53.034
We could, um, go to a movie.

04:53.036 --> 04:55.036
What else could we do?

04:56.738 --> 05:00.875
I guess we could, um...
Who's that guy?

05:00.877 --> 05:02.576
Who?

05:07.616 --> 05:10.484
Did you see that?
Careful! Sorry, sir.

05:10.486 --> 05:13.821
Did you see that man?
What man?

05:13.823 --> 05:15.723
Him?

05:15.725 --> 05:18.025
His face!
Shh!

05:22.831 --> 05:24.632
Great tour.

05:24.634 --> 05:27.668
Yeah, we could do this today.
We'll give you a call.

05:27.670 --> 05:29.437
There has been a lot of
interest in the place.

05:29.439 --> 05:32.873
We'll give you a call.
Thank you.

05:32.875 --> 05:37.611
Thank you.
It was great.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.513
You should've gone inside,
and the price is perfect.

05:39.515 --> 05:41.382
It's not right.

05:41.384 --> 05:43.784
What's wrong with it?
You didn't even give it a chance.

05:43.786 --> 05:46.020
It had a pool.

05:46.022 --> 05:48.789
How long exactly do you
plan on staying with us?

05:48.791 --> 05:51.592
Jesus, Don.
I am sorry to burden you.

05:51.594 --> 05:53.594
It's your fault
you're in that thing.

05:53.596 --> 05:56.030
It's yuppy-ville around here,
drives me crazy.

05:56.032 --> 05:58.432
Come on, let's take a
look at this place.

05:58.434 --> 06:02.103
Where did you get that?
I want to go home!

06:02.105 --> 06:05.673
It won't take long.
I'm telling you what I saw!

06:05.675 --> 06:07.541
Oh, my God.
I saw him, too.

06:07.543 --> 06:10.811
There was nothing wrong with
him, except for the tacky hat.

06:10.813 --> 06:12.546
Dad, why won't you
listen to me?

06:12.548 --> 06:17.017
Please, Emmy, I understand you don't
want to be here, OK, but really!

06:17.019 --> 06:20.521
This has nothing to do with her!
Her?

06:20.523 --> 06:24.458
Is that how I'm referred to now?
I'll refer to you any way I like!

06:24.460 --> 06:26.093
Both of you, stop it!

06:26.095 --> 06:30.564
Now we're going to go see this house,
and then we're going to go home.

06:30.566 --> 06:32.967
And I don't want to hear any more
about it from either of you.

06:32.969 --> 06:34.468
I don't want to hear a word!

06:56.057 --> 06:58.492
That's him, that's the
guy from the restaurant.

06:58.494 --> 07:00.060
Emmy!

07:02.063 --> 07:05.466
Come on.
Look at this place!

07:05.468 --> 07:06.901
Huh?

07:19.448 --> 07:21.682
Well, it looks like we
missed the open house.

07:21.684 --> 07:24.718
Technically
it's still an open house.

07:30.091 --> 07:31.992
Hello?

07:34.062 --> 07:36.063
Hello?

07:41.169 --> 07:44.104
Welcome to lot number 6485.

07:44.106 --> 07:48.609
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

07:48.611 --> 07:52.646
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

07:52.648 --> 07:56.250
I think you'll like what you see.
People are so lazy nowadays.

07:56.252 --> 07:58.586
Well, we can go in.

08:09.764 --> 08:11.565
Who's this?

08:18.673 --> 08:20.107
This is more like it.

08:20.109 --> 08:22.009
Hi.

08:22.011 --> 08:24.945
I take it you're not the realtor?
No.

08:24.947 --> 08:28.983
We're the Hayses.
I'm Charlie Hays.

08:28.985 --> 08:30.718
Don.

08:30.720 --> 08:35.089
The door was wide open,
we just peeked in.

08:35.091 --> 08:39.193
The number's on the sign,
we'll just get it.

08:41.229 --> 08:44.565
I'm cold.
I'm gonna go sit in the car.

08:46.902 --> 08:48.536
Bye.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.906
He seems friendly.

08:51.908 --> 08:56.611
He sees us as competition,
and well he should.

08:56.913 --> 08:58.145
For what?

08:58.147 --> 09:01.048
Oh, come on, this is pristine!

09:01.050 --> 09:04.118
70 acres in the middle of nowhere.

09:04.120 --> 09:05.853
That's my point.

09:18.767 --> 09:21.902
The service out here sucks.
Dad!

09:28.209 --> 09:29.910
Is everybody OK?
Yeah.

09:29.912 --> 09:31.879
Emmy?
I'm fine.

09:31.881 --> 09:35.816
You didn't hit her, did you?
No, he didn't hit her.

09:35.818 --> 09:38.285
You didn't, did you?
No.

09:38.287 --> 09:40.220
I don't think so.

09:47.662 --> 09:50.164
Hello?

09:50.166 --> 09:53.667
Oh, my God.
Hello?

09:53.669 --> 09:55.069
Would you help me, please?

09:56.872 --> 09:58.105
What's the matter?
Is somebody after you?

09:58.107 --> 10:00.608
I think she bit her tongue.

10:02.177 --> 10:04.278
Just keep her down.

10:14.289 --> 10:17.124
Did you hit her?

10:17.126 --> 10:19.760
No, she ran out of the woods
in front of the car, we swerved.

10:19.762 --> 10:22.029
What's wrong with her mouth?
She bit her tongue.

10:22.031 --> 10:23.731
Fucking gross.

10:23.733 --> 10:25.399
She's in shock.
How do you know?

10:25.401 --> 10:29.370
I'm a nurse.
She was running from someone.

10:31.840 --> 10:34.241
Do you think this is
why the house is empty?

10:34.243 --> 10:37.044
What...
well, what do you mean?

10:41.116 --> 10:45.686
Let's get out of here,
let's get her to the hospital.

10:45.688 --> 10:48.155
One, two, three.

10:52.327 --> 10:54.361
Hey! Hey!

10:54.363 --> 10:57.765
Don! What are you doing?

11:03.838 --> 11:05.406
Could you turn the heat up, please?

11:05.408 --> 11:08.342
She's freezing.
Who do you think she is?

11:08.344 --> 11:09.877
Maybe a runaway?

11:09.879 --> 11:11.845
Who cares?
I just want her out of my car.

11:11.847 --> 11:15.249
How can you say that?
Easy. There's something off.

11:15.251 --> 11:18.152
Or am I the only one to see that?
No, Don, for God's sakes.

11:18.154 --> 11:20.287
You're not the only one who
sees that something's off.

11:20.289 --> 11:23.290
OK, I'm sure there's a
reasonable explanation for this.

11:23.292 --> 11:24.692
Sure there is.

11:24.694 --> 11:26.126
Does any of this
seem reasonable to you?

11:26.128 --> 11:28.996
Hey!
Why the hell did you turn around?

11:28.998 --> 11:30.364
I didn't.

11:30.366 --> 11:31.398
We must have turned around, right?

11:31.400 --> 11:34.234
I didn't turn around.

11:34.236 --> 11:37.071
Keep her quiet!

11:37.073 --> 11:40.474
It's OK, it's OK, it's OK, it's OK.

11:48.817 --> 11:50.451
Did you see that?
What the fuck?

11:50.453 --> 11:52.152
It's OK.

12:04.799 --> 12:08.902
What do you think?
Welcome to lot number 6485.

12:08.904 --> 12:13.040
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

12:13.042 --> 12:17.311
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

12:17.313 --> 12:19.980
I think you'll like what you see.

12:34.329 --> 12:36.463
Would you slow down!
Dad, relax!

12:36.465 --> 12:39.299
Yeah, take it easy, will you?
Don't tell me to take it easy!

12:39.301 --> 12:40.868
What...
Don't!

12:40.870 --> 12:43.036
Get out.
What do you want?

12:43.038 --> 12:45.172
Get out, Jason.
Ow!

12:45.174 --> 12:46.974
Get off her!

12:46.976 --> 12:49.042
Tell me what's going on!
Get off her!

12:52.981 --> 12:56.950
Oh, my God!
Her tongue is gone!

12:56.952 --> 12:59.319
This is fucked up!

12:59.321 --> 13:01.155
I'm sorry.

13:50.271 --> 13:53.841
What's going on?

13:55.543 --> 13:57.611
We're out of gas.

13:59.881 --> 14:01.582
I'm gonna take a walk
through the woods.

14:01.584 --> 14:05.252
No, no, Don, please don't.
There's somebody out there.

14:07.055 --> 14:09.323
Someone's bound to show
up in the morning.

14:09.325 --> 14:11.158
What do you mean, stay here?

14:11.160 --> 14:14.428
I saw a fireplace and
firewood inside.

14:14.430 --> 14:16.263
No, uh-uh, no,
I don't want to do that.

14:16.265 --> 14:17.931
That's a bad idea.

14:22.637 --> 14:25.439
Flashlights?
Give me some flashlights.

14:27.609 --> 14:30.911
Here.
It's OK.

14:32.380 --> 14:34.147
She doesn't want to come inside.

14:34.149 --> 14:36.116
She's got to come inside,
it's freezing out here.

14:36.118 --> 14:39.319
It's all right, it's all right,
we're not gonna hurt you.

14:39.321 --> 14:43.290
She doesn't want to go.
She does... come on, you guys.

14:43.292 --> 14:46.660
She doesn't want to...
Dad, please don't.

14:46.662 --> 14:50.964
We all have to stay together.
She doesn't want to come inside!

14:50.966 --> 14:53.667
We got to get her...
Stop it, stop it!

14:56.204 --> 14:59.139
What is the matter with you? Do you
want to spend the night in the car?

15:01.676 --> 15:03.677
Charlie!

15:15.991 --> 15:17.190
No...

15:28.202 --> 15:32.706
Let's get her upstairs into one of
the beds in the upstairs bedrooms.

15:32.708 --> 15:35.075
All right, let's go, come on.

15:35.077 --> 15:36.997
What's wrong with her?
What's she looking at?

15:39.348 --> 15:42.182
Try to put her on one of
the sofas in the den.

15:46.956 --> 15:50.958
All right, all right.

15:50.960 --> 15:55.228
I'll get a... I'll get a blanket
from one of the bedrooms.

16:22.623 --> 16:25.058
Thinking about starting a family?

16:25.060 --> 16:28.562
There's plenty of room for
your little bundle of joy here!

17:15.742 --> 17:18.211
Leslie?
Thank you.

17:21.214 --> 17:23.282
She has a fever.

17:27.688 --> 17:32.459
We tried to leave 23 times.

17:32.461 --> 17:34.394
Was it that many?

17:37.365 --> 17:42.069
Do you think she was trying
to leave and couldn't?

17:42.071 --> 17:44.204
I don't know.

17:44.206 --> 17:47.340
Would you please be quiet?

17:47.342 --> 17:50.243
I can say whatever I want.

17:53.114 --> 17:55.482
I can't be stuck here!

17:55.484 --> 17:58.685
I don't think any of us
want to be stuck here.

17:58.687 --> 18:03.156
We need to be patient,
because someone is gonna come.

18:03.158 --> 18:06.226
Some of us have a life, OK?

18:09.530 --> 18:11.198
We do!

18:13.267 --> 18:15.335
Oh, Jesus.

18:40.261 --> 18:42.662
I got to get some wood.

20:09.784 --> 20:11.918
Was that just sitting there?

20:13.788 --> 20:15.422
Yeah.

20:46.420 --> 20:48.321
I was rude.

20:50.324 --> 20:52.993
It's just that...

20:52.995 --> 20:56.796
I start a new shift on Monday.

20:56.798 --> 20:59.633
We can't be stuck here.
Right?

21:01.002 --> 21:03.270
I hope not.

21:05.640 --> 21:08.408
What do you do?

21:08.410 --> 21:12.712
I was a third grade teacher...
before kids.

21:14.482 --> 21:18.885
Is he your only one?
He is now.

21:23.891 --> 21:26.326
Someone was here today.

21:26.328 --> 21:29.996
There's fresh shaving
cream upstairs.

21:29.998 --> 21:32.499
Look at this.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.402
Seven cans.
Just enough.

21:35.404 --> 21:39.673
Wow.
That's wonderfully creepy.

21:56.390 --> 21:58.024
Gross.

22:10.705 --> 22:13.340
Your mother's really scared.

22:13.342 --> 22:15.575
She's not my mom.

22:15.577 --> 22:17.844
You don't like her.
I can tell.

22:17.846 --> 22:19.813
Jason.
I'm sorry, hon.

22:19.815 --> 22:24.084
No, no, it's fine.
I don't like her.

22:31.125 --> 22:35.528
So, uh, where's your mom?

22:40.901 --> 22:44.738
Hello!
Shut up, Jason.

22:48.008 --> 22:52.579
So how'd you break your leg?
Car crash.

22:52.581 --> 22:54.848
Yeah?
Yeah.

22:57.852 --> 23:01.054
Didn't get a ticket, though.

23:01.056 --> 23:04.424
I was able to drive home,
even with a broken leg.

23:04.426 --> 23:06.559
Lucky you.

23:18.839 --> 23:23.009
I'll take the first watch.
Wake you in a few hours.

23:23.011 --> 23:25.445
Want to sleep next to me?

23:27.515 --> 23:30.183
I was just messing around.

23:39.727 --> 23:42.662
Welcome to lot number 6485.

23:42.664 --> 23:46.766
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

23:46.768 --> 23:51.070
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

23:51.072 --> 23:55.809
I think you'll like what you see!
Welcome to lot number 6485.

23:55.811 --> 23:59.946
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers...

23:59.948 --> 24:02.816
Turn that shit off!

24:02.818 --> 24:05.485
Feel free to take a look around.
I think you'll like what you see.

24:05.487 --> 24:08.455
Press the buttons on the speakers
you see around the house...

24:08.457 --> 24:11.558
Where's the girl?
Welcome to lot number 6485.

24:11.560 --> 24:14.527
I think you'll like what you see.
Feel free to take a look around.

24:16.530 --> 24:21.601
If the girl goes outside, she could die.
Son of a bitch, that's him!

24:25.473 --> 24:26.940
Don't go out there!
What if he's chasing after her?

24:26.942 --> 24:30.477
Then we need to have a talk.
Don, stop it! Don't go out!

24:30.479 --> 24:31.911
Stubborn!

24:42.523 --> 24:43.790
Hey!

24:43.792 --> 24:45.091
Stop!

24:48.696 --> 24:51.231
Shit!
Where did they go?

24:51.233 --> 24:52.832
Dad!

24:52.834 --> 24:54.667
Get back to the house!
Get back to the house!

24:54.669 --> 24:56.870
That's him, that's they
guy from the restaurant!

24:56.872 --> 25:00.073
I met that guy.
He told me about this place.

25:00.075 --> 25:01.774
Let's get back to the house.
Come on.

25:01.776 --> 25:04.644
I'm going to try and walk to the road.
But that thing is out there!

25:04.646 --> 25:08.214
Come on, come on, it'll be... it'll be OK.
Get back, get back to the house.

25:10.819 --> 25:13.586
You bitch!
What are you doing?

25:13.588 --> 25:15.188
You have no idea what
the fuck she's doing!

25:15.190 --> 25:18.091
Wait till you see what I found!

25:24.164 --> 25:25.765
Come with me.

25:33.607 --> 25:35.608
Check it out, it's still warm.

25:37.611 --> 25:38.678
Oh, what?
You think she did this?

25:38.680 --> 25:40.680
Wait, check this out, come on.

25:44.018 --> 25:47.320
Look.
She must have done it.

25:50.858 --> 25:52.091
Why do you say that?

25:52.093 --> 25:56.229
She was the only one gone!

25:56.231 --> 25:58.665
She just had her tongue cut out.

25:58.667 --> 26:02.201
I doubt that she's stacking
cans in the pantry.

26:04.605 --> 26:07.206
I'm just saying.

26:07.208 --> 26:09.309
I'm gonna go start a fire.

26:12.046 --> 26:14.781
<i>♪ She said, Charlie, my dear... ♪</i>

26:21.889 --> 26:26.359
Jason, find a station
and leave it there, OK?

26:26.361 --> 26:28.161
What are you doing?

26:28.163 --> 26:31.030
I just figured
if we're gonna be here...

26:39.340 --> 26:42.275
I think the phone service
must be cut at the pole.

26:42.277 --> 26:46.646
The water heater's busted.
I couldn't get the heater to work,

26:46.648 --> 26:51.284
but we've got plenty of firewood,
so we won't freeze to death.

26:51.286 --> 26:52.619
Anything from the girl?

26:52.621 --> 26:54.220
No.

26:54.222 --> 26:55.922
Is she eating?

27:02.163 --> 27:06.265
Psst! Hey! Turn that thing off!
Turn it off!

27:20.347 --> 27:22.682
Bring him in, he's frozen!

27:25.919 --> 27:28.054
Sit down. Come by the fire.
Come on, come on.

27:28.056 --> 27:29.088
You OK?

27:30.792 --> 27:32.158
Get a blanket.

27:34.028 --> 27:35.962
Did you find someone?

27:35.964 --> 27:40.700
I could hear cars going
by just over the hill.

27:40.702 --> 27:42.335
So they're coming to get us?

27:42.337 --> 27:46.272
They were always just...
over the hill.

27:46.274 --> 27:47.774
What do you mean?

27:47.776 --> 27:52.579
I mean, every time
I went across the hill,

27:52.781 --> 27:57.150
they were just over the next fucking hill!
So you didn't even get to the road?

27:57.152 --> 28:01.020
Jason, what are you missing
in "just over the next hill?"

28:01.022 --> 28:02.889
I walked around for I don't
know how many hours,

28:02.891 --> 28:07.293
and every time I looked around,
there was the house.

28:07.295 --> 28:08.728
This house!

28:08.730 --> 28:12.999
I'm sorry.
I cannot get stuck here!

28:13.001 --> 28:16.169
Shut up.
Excuse me?

28:16.171 --> 28:19.739
Shut up.
The girl knows.

28:21.208 --> 28:24.110
We all stay here
until someone comes.

28:24.112 --> 28:25.778
OK?

29:17.531 --> 29:20.366
Welcome to lot number 6485.

29:20.368 --> 29:24.470
Feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers

29:24.472 --> 29:28.975
you see around the house to
hear about this great place!

29:28.977 --> 29:31.277
I think you'll like what you see.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.569
Do you want me to wash it?

30:01.008 --> 30:04.143
No, it'll work...

30:04.145 --> 30:06.546
for one more day.

30:06.548 --> 30:09.348
Did you sleep last night?

30:09.350 --> 30:12.118
No.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.153
Not at all?

30:14.155 --> 30:15.488
Mm-mm.

30:21.094 --> 30:23.162
How was your night?

30:23.164 --> 30:24.497
Are you serious?

30:24.499 --> 30:27.166
Yes, I...

30:27.168 --> 30:29.836
Fine, thank you.

30:38.512 --> 30:42.148
Are you coming downstairs?
No.

30:42.150 --> 30:44.483
Do you want me to stay here?

30:47.354 --> 30:49.388
What?

30:49.390 --> 30:53.226
I just can't help thinking...

30:53.228 --> 30:56.395
I wasn't even supposed to be here.

30:56.397 --> 30:58.331
Why's that?

30:58.333 --> 31:02.902
Charlie, I told you I didn't
want to go looking at houses.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.871
With Emmy, you mean.

31:04.873 --> 31:08.341
No. No, I mean...

32:49.009 --> 32:51.043
I want to get the kindling today.

32:52.579 --> 32:55.448
You get to go outside.

32:55.450 --> 32:57.149
I'll go with her.

32:59.619 --> 33:01.320
Take this.

33:05.659 --> 33:08.160
Well, don't... don't go far.

33:18.338 --> 33:20.139
No one's coming.

33:23.643 --> 33:25.745
You want to go out there again?

33:28.482 --> 33:31.617
Don't know what else
we can do but try.

33:35.756 --> 33:38.124
At least that thing
hasn't been back.

33:38.126 --> 33:41.627
Only one lucky family will
call this house their home.

33:41.629 --> 33:44.630
Will it be your family?

33:44.632 --> 33:47.533
But it is watching.

33:47.535 --> 33:49.402
I get that much.

34:03.383 --> 34:07.520
You're almost walking normal.
I only need the brace for a week more.

34:19.331 --> 34:21.067
Can I kiss you?

34:24.170 --> 34:25.571
You remind me of my ex.

34:38.851 --> 34:40.619
More photographs.

34:42.188 --> 34:46.792
Your name is on these.
It's from the bank.

34:46.793 --> 34:48.627
Foreclosure agreement.

34:50.630 --> 34:52.565
Is that why we're here?

34:52.567 --> 34:55.868
Because you foreclosed
on these people's house?

35:10.317 --> 35:13.352
There's a boy in the window.
Mm-hmm.

35:13.354 --> 35:16.122
I'm serious!
Yeah, uh-huh.

35:20.794 --> 35:23.629
We must have evicted them.

35:24.865 --> 35:26.332
Oh.

35:28.735 --> 35:29.869
What's wrong?
There's someone in the house.

35:29.871 --> 35:32.872
Who? Who?
I saw a little boy in that window.

35:35.408 --> 35:38.444
This is him, this is
the boy that I saw.

36:06.373 --> 36:07.740
What is it?

36:11.344 --> 36:13.579
Not a sane one in this house.

36:17.450 --> 36:20.653
He was standing right there.

36:20.655 --> 36:23.289
You sure you saw someone?

36:51.484 --> 36:52.952
Mommy?

36:54.955 --> 36:56.689
Mommy?

37:01.695 --> 37:03.362
Lizzy.

37:04.564 --> 37:07.499
Baby, what are you doing here?

37:07.501 --> 37:10.269
I came to see you, Mommy.

37:12.572 --> 37:14.106
Baby.

37:14.508 --> 37:16.809
I miss you so much.

37:18.678 --> 37:20.946
Oh, look at that.

37:20.948 --> 37:24.717
We never could get that hair
to stay in place, could we?

37:24.719 --> 37:28.254
Let's fix that. OK.
Let's put that up.

37:28.256 --> 37:31.323
Look at your sweet little face.

37:33.526 --> 37:34.893
There.

37:36.696 --> 37:41.300
There! Look at that!
I can't stay.

37:41.302 --> 37:44.303
Oh, no, please don't go.
Don't go now.

37:44.305 --> 37:46.805
Please don't leave Mommy.
Stay with me.

37:46.807 --> 37:49.008
Please stay with Mommy.

38:00.420 --> 38:02.454
What about everybody else?

38:04.391 --> 38:05.691
I can't.

38:06.726 --> 38:08.594
I can't.

38:10.664 --> 38:12.898
I love you so much.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.000
I love you, too, Mommy.

39:25.405 --> 39:27.873
I'm gonna get sick if I eat
any more of this shit.

39:27.875 --> 39:32.611
Honey, please don't ruin dinner.
But it's not dinner. It's crap.

39:32.613 --> 39:35.447
Don't talk to your mother that way.

39:35.449 --> 39:37.950
At least we have something.

39:40.387 --> 39:41.887
What?

39:47.127 --> 39:49.561
Do you like being here?

39:51.698 --> 39:56.034
It's just... it seems like it.

39:56.036 --> 40:00.806
You know, you're always cleaning
and straightening and...

40:00.808 --> 40:02.641
It's not making
a bit of difference.

40:02.643 --> 40:07.646
How is that any different than
out there in the real world?

40:07.648 --> 40:11.083
Oh, I think
it's very goddamn different.

40:17.624 --> 40:18.891
Sorry.

40:18.893 --> 40:23.829
Let's just all take a breath, OK?

40:25.832 --> 40:27.499
No.

40:29.702 --> 40:31.870
You know something.

40:35.074 --> 40:39.511
It is not my fault that
you can't handle this.

40:41.714 --> 40:43.749
You know what I can't handle?

40:43.751 --> 40:47.686
I can't handle
your demure attitude.

40:47.688 --> 40:50.923
You know what that means?

40:50.925 --> 40:52.791
Or did you not teach that
to your third graders?

40:52.793 --> 40:55.994
Susan...
Please.

40:55.996 --> 40:59.932
It's OK.
She can't help herself.

40:59.934 --> 41:00.999
Oh, please.

41:02.969 --> 41:07.706
Do you think you're the only
person who's ever lost someone?

41:07.708 --> 41:09.775
Huh?

41:09.777 --> 41:12.544
The rest of us just
haven't given up!

41:29.529 --> 41:31.763
You all just keep pushing.

41:45.879 --> 41:48.113
I'm not the enemy.

41:53.820 --> 41:56.788
We could have saved her.

41:56.790 --> 41:59.725
We did everything we could.
Please...

41:59.727 --> 42:03.228
No, just get away from me.
Just get away from me.

42:04.898 --> 42:07.032
Get away from me!

42:36.930 --> 42:38.730
Baby.

42:45.672 --> 42:46.939
Yeah.

42:48.107 --> 42:51.310
OK.
OK.

42:56.649 --> 43:01.720
On the speakers you see around the
house to hear about this great place!

43:01.722 --> 43:03.755
I think you'll like what you see.

43:03.757 --> 43:06.825
It takes a family to
make a house a home.

43:10.998 --> 43:15.100
<i>♪ I'm crazy about you</i>

43:15.102 --> 43:17.803
<i>♪ Without you</i>

43:17.805 --> 43:21.707
<i>♪ For you I'm strong</i>

43:21.709 --> 43:24.343
<i>♪ I can't do without you</i>

43:24.345 --> 43:26.979
<i>♪ Howcha magowcha</i>

43:26.981 --> 43:30.115
<i>♪ Don't stay too long</i>

44:06.819 --> 44:09.087
Charlie! Charlie!

44:11.958 --> 44:15.861
You would never do that.
Right?

44:18.698 --> 44:22.868
Do what?
Would you?

45:08.848 --> 45:12.484
I went into a house,
and it wasn't a house.

45:12.486 --> 45:17.189
It has big steps
and a great, big hall.

45:17.191 --> 45:22.394
But it hasn't got a garden,
a garden, a garden.

45:22.396 --> 45:25.297
It isn't like a house at all.

45:30.303 --> 45:33.138
How do we get out of here?

45:41.981 --> 45:44.750
What did she say? Huh?

45:44.752 --> 45:48.353
What is that?
What do you know?

45:51.257 --> 45:53.225
How did you get here?

45:56.262 --> 45:59.498
Did you come to look at the house?

45:59.500 --> 46:03.435
Yeah.
Did you come alone?

46:20.219 --> 46:22.087
What does it want?

46:24.991 --> 46:26.391
The house?

46:28.027 --> 46:31.096
Then why the hell
did it give me the flyer?

46:31.098 --> 46:33.498
You want it, take it!
You hear me?

46:33.500 --> 46:36.535
You want the whole place, take it!

46:39.305 --> 46:41.540
Where's your mother?
I don't know.

46:41.542 --> 46:44.509
I'll find her.
You get our cans of food.

46:44.511 --> 46:46.545
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
what are you doing?

46:46.547 --> 46:48.280
Remember what that thing said?

46:48.282 --> 46:51.149
Only one family can have
this house. We're leaving.

46:51.151 --> 46:53.585
Well, then we're going with you.
No, you're not.

46:53.587 --> 46:56.588
You're staying with her.
You're not leaving us here unarmed!

46:56.590 --> 46:58.423
I saw the eviction notice!

46:58.425 --> 47:01.259
Whoever you kicked out
of here wants you!

47:01.261 --> 47:05.096
You're staying.
Leslie! Leslie!

47:05.098 --> 47:07.499
There are only six cans.

47:12.939 --> 47:15.574
Who took the can?
I don't know.

47:15.576 --> 47:18.944
Look, we stand a better chance
if we all stick together.

47:18.946 --> 47:21.179
Oh, yeah?
How do you know that?

47:21.181 --> 47:22.480
And why should I trust you?

47:22.482 --> 47:24.950
For all I know, you took the can!
You're being ridiculous.

47:24.952 --> 47:28.119
Leslie, come on!
We're going with you.

47:28.121 --> 47:33.291
No, you are not.
Come on, Mom! Let's go!

47:34.527 --> 47:36.228
Leslie?

47:45.972 --> 47:47.572
Mom?

48:05.892 --> 48:09.661
No! No! No!
No, no, no.

48:11.063 --> 48:13.999
Get a knife!
OK.

48:23.643 --> 48:26.411
No, baby, no.
No, no, no.

48:28.481 --> 48:31.249
Just let me check her,
just let me check her, please.

48:39.558 --> 48:43.094
You're gonna be all right.
You're gonna be all right.

48:45.197 --> 48:47.399
She did this hours ago.

48:51.070 --> 48:52.470
You caused this.

48:52.472 --> 48:55.507
What?
Me?

48:55.509 --> 48:58.176
Yeah. You had to keep
pushing her, didn't you?

48:58.178 --> 49:00.712
Didn't you?
Stop it!

49:07.553 --> 49:10.355
Keep pushing me, Charlie,
I dare you.

49:10.357 --> 49:11.990
Huh?

49:17.263 --> 49:19.230
Oh, baby...

50:12.585 --> 50:15.220
I guess she couldn't handle it.

50:59.098 --> 51:00.565
Dad?

51:04.703 --> 51:07.472
Your neck.
Huh?

51:12.545 --> 51:15.113
You hanging in there, kiddo?

51:15.115 --> 51:20.752
Yeah.
I was thinking about Mom.

51:24.156 --> 51:27.358
I was thinking about the
time we went to the beach.

51:28.794 --> 51:31.729
I remember how much you
two were fighting.

51:31.731 --> 51:34.132
Married people fight.

51:34.734 --> 51:37.702
Were you guys
going to get a divorce?

51:40.372 --> 51:43.541
Is this about Susan?
No.

51:43.543 --> 51:48.379
Well, then why do you ask?
It just seemed that way.

51:48.381 --> 51:53.184
Why does it matter now?
I just want to know.

51:54.787 --> 51:58.223
She was seeing someone else.

51:58.225 --> 52:00.592
So she was going to leave us?

52:02.328 --> 52:06.631
I guess so.
I don't understand.

52:06.633 --> 52:08.566
Why would she do
something like that?

52:08.568 --> 52:10.535
I don't know.

52:24.350 --> 52:29.721
Welcome to lot number 6485.
Feel free to take a look around.

52:29.723 --> 52:33.625
Press the buttons on the speakers you
see around the house to hear about...

52:33.627 --> 52:37.529
Welcome to lot number 6485.
I think you'll like what you...

52:37.531 --> 52:40.832
feel free to take a look around.
Press the buttons on the speakers

52:40.834 --> 52:44.369
you see around the house
to hear about this...

52:45.738 --> 52:48.606
I'm sorry.

52:48.608 --> 52:52.577
It's for the best.
You can see her now.

52:57.283 --> 52:58.716
I'm sorry.

53:01.720 --> 53:03.821
It's for the best.

53:07.826 --> 53:09.727
You can see her now.

53:11.931 --> 53:14.265
You can see her now.

53:38.591 --> 53:39.924
You OK?

53:41.760 --> 53:43.861
I saw him.

53:48.234 --> 53:52.637
Who?
The man with the white face.

53:52.639 --> 53:57.642
He shot himself.
He shot the little boy.

53:59.645 --> 54:01.446
There's nothing in there.

54:02.781 --> 54:06.284
Nothing in there is real.

54:06.286 --> 54:08.453
You're gonna be OK.

54:11.023 --> 54:14.559
Come on, I'd never let
anything happen to you, OK?

54:14.561 --> 54:17.362
Never let anything happen to you.

54:24.703 --> 54:28.439
Shit!
Shit!

57:19.478 --> 57:21.512
Help me.

58:08.927 --> 58:12.196
I'm glad you're fucking dead!

58:12.198 --> 58:15.700
Show me what you want!
I don't care!

58:15.702 --> 58:19.237
I don't care!
I don't care what you show me!

58:19.239 --> 58:21.906
She deserved to die!

58:32.684 --> 58:34.118
Hey!

59:10.822 --> 59:14.826
I went to a house,
but it wasn't a house.

59:15.328 --> 59:19.464
It has big steps and
a great, big hall.

59:20.066 --> 59:25.169
But it has not a garden,
a garden, a garden.

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:03.341
Hello?

01:00:06.745 --> 01:00:09.213
What are you doing here?

01:00:09.215 --> 01:00:12.049
Same thing you're doing here.

01:00:14.186 --> 01:00:16.320
I know you're out.

01:00:21.994 --> 01:00:23.928
Take a load off.

01:00:34.373 --> 01:00:36.073
Miss her, huh?

01:00:37.743 --> 01:00:40.378
I didn't see it coming, you know?

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:43.147
She's always been so...
Stable?

01:00:43.149 --> 01:00:46.050
And sweet.

01:00:46.052 --> 01:00:49.353
The first time I shot a
deer and brought it home,

01:00:49.355 --> 01:00:51.656
she actually cried.

01:00:53.158 --> 01:00:55.660
She hated when I would hunt.

01:00:55.662 --> 01:00:59.030
She did like venison, though.

01:00:59.032 --> 01:01:01.165
She was a good cook.

01:01:04.236 --> 01:01:07.204
I can't remember the last
time I told her that.

01:01:07.206 --> 01:01:09.874
Hell of a situation you're in, huh?

01:01:09.876 --> 01:01:11.776
Don't you mean that we're in?

01:01:11.778 --> 01:01:15.312
You're on your own on this one.

01:01:15.314 --> 01:01:17.948
If it wasn't for that bitch.

01:01:17.950 --> 01:01:21.052
How dare she bring up our daughter.

01:01:21.054 --> 01:01:24.455
I can tell you're not putting
two and two together.

01:01:24.457 --> 01:01:26.891
What do you mean?

01:01:26.893 --> 01:01:30.261
I think Susan knew
what she was doing.

01:01:30.263 --> 01:01:35.166
She just picked at her and
she couldn't take it, and...

01:01:35.168 --> 01:01:38.836
Why do you think she would do that?

01:01:38.838 --> 01:01:42.006
If I knew, you'd know.

01:01:42.008 --> 01:01:43.908
I've got a hunch, though.

01:01:43.910 --> 01:01:47.044
You want to hear it?
Uh-huh.

01:01:47.046 --> 01:01:52.316
I think they know what they're doing.
What do you mean?

01:01:52.318 --> 01:01:55.820
You heard what the house said...
us or them.

01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:59.890
And they're playing dirty.
It's just a hunch, though.

01:01:59.892 --> 01:02:02.226
So...

01:02:02.228 --> 01:02:04.795
They're in it to win it, huh?

01:02:07.866 --> 01:02:10.835
Hello?
How's it going?

01:02:10.837 --> 01:02:12.403
Man, I'll tell you,
it's been a little rough.

01:02:12.405 --> 01:02:14.839
The whole family's had the flu.

01:02:17.075 --> 01:02:19.143
Hello?!

01:02:24.983 --> 01:02:27.151
I just shaved.
Nice, huh?

01:02:29.521 --> 01:02:33.124
Did you hear anyone?
No.

01:02:33.126 --> 01:02:37.294
Look, I didn't mean to come
across so pushy before.

01:02:37.296 --> 01:02:39.396
I'm sure you have someone you miss.

01:02:39.398 --> 01:02:43.868
I heard cars and people talking.
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:02:43.870 --> 01:02:46.871
Huh?
A boyfriend?

01:02:46.873 --> 01:02:50.107
Do you have one?
No.

01:02:51.943 --> 01:02:55.513
I know I'm a little older,
but what does that matter?

01:02:55.515 --> 01:02:58.282
I'm gonna go warm up.
I'll keep you warm.

01:02:58.284 --> 01:03:00.384
I want to go back to the house.

01:03:00.386 --> 01:03:02.353
You're not even giving it a chance!

01:03:02.355 --> 01:03:04.855
I'm going back to the house.

01:03:06.458 --> 01:03:08.526
Well, if you guys want to go...
Do you hear that?

01:03:08.528 --> 01:03:10.394
What?

01:03:17.836 --> 01:03:20.871
All I wanted was a kiss!
One kiss!

01:03:20.873 --> 01:03:22.406
But you had to be such a prude!

01:03:23.942 --> 01:03:26.377
You never know what other
people are capable of.

01:03:26.379 --> 01:03:28.445
But, then again,

01:03:28.447 --> 01:03:31.482
you never quite know what
you're capable of, either.

01:03:33.084 --> 01:03:34.485
Hey.

01:03:39.925 --> 01:03:42.493
The more you struggle,
the longer this will take.

01:03:58.977 --> 01:04:02.513
What the fuck are you waiting for?
Go get some help!

01:04:22.300 --> 01:04:26.537
Oh, my God. Jason, what the...
What the hell happened?

01:04:28.139 --> 01:04:32.343
That fucking mute bitch
hit me with a log!

01:04:32.345 --> 01:04:35.646
Why did she hit you?
I don't know, ow!

01:04:35.648 --> 01:04:40.517
It caught you good, man.
What were you doing out here?

01:04:40.519 --> 01:04:43.220
I was following the girl!
The mute girl?

01:04:43.222 --> 01:04:47.958
No! The girl! Emmy!
What was she doing out here?

01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:51.061
Trying to leave, I think.
She was trying to leave?

01:04:51.063 --> 01:04:52.496
Maybe, fuck, who cares?
Get this out of me!

01:04:52.498 --> 01:04:54.398
All right, all right, all right.

01:05:01.640 --> 01:05:04.942
Don.
Yeah?

01:05:04.944 --> 01:05:08.279
Why don't you let Susan
take a look at him?

01:05:08.281 --> 01:05:12.249
Should I let her
take a look at him, Chuck?

01:05:12.251 --> 01:05:16.053
So she can "take care of him," huh?

01:05:16.055 --> 01:05:21.458
We're just trying to help.
Like you helped Leslie?

01:05:21.460 --> 01:05:23.560
What are you talking about?

01:05:25.497 --> 01:05:30.534
You're just gonna pick us off, one by
one, until you can leave, that the plan?

01:05:30.536 --> 01:05:33.304
Of course not.

01:05:33.306 --> 01:05:36.307
It's you or us.

01:05:37.009 --> 01:05:38.642
Isn't that right?

01:05:41.313 --> 01:05:44.148
So you're with them, too, huh?

01:05:44.150 --> 01:05:46.417
She only hit him because
he tried to rape me.

01:05:46.419 --> 01:05:47.985
That's bullshit!

01:05:47.987 --> 01:05:50.187
Alright, don't.
Ow!

01:05:53.458 --> 01:05:55.192
I'm gonna get you off that thing.

01:05:55.194 --> 01:05:57.561
You can't just pull it out, Don,
he could bleed to death.

01:05:57.563 --> 01:06:01.565
Shut up.
Look at me in the eye.

01:06:01.567 --> 01:06:05.436
I'm gonna count to three.
Give me your hands.

01:06:07.172 --> 01:06:08.672
One...

01:06:13.311 --> 01:06:14.378
Two...

01:06:25.724 --> 01:06:30.327
Put some wood on the fire.
OK, look at his wound.

01:06:30.329 --> 01:06:33.464
Let's just take it easy
with the orders, Don, OK?

01:06:33.466 --> 01:06:37.301
Or what, Chuck? Huh?

01:06:37.303 --> 01:06:39.003
There's some gauze
and alcohol upstairs.

01:06:39.005 --> 01:06:42.539
Someone get it, please.
I'll get it.

01:06:46.778 --> 01:06:50.180
You can see it, right?
What does it look like?

01:06:50.182 --> 01:06:53.484
It didn't hit any major organs.
It needs to be stitched,

01:06:53.486 --> 01:06:56.353
and he should be given antibiotics.
So where do we find those, huh?

01:06:56.355 --> 01:07:02.092
I know that. I'm just saying, OK?
But he's gonna be OK?

01:07:02.094 --> 01:07:05.596
It depends on how much blood he's
lost, and if it gets infected.

01:07:05.598 --> 01:07:08.098
I'm right fucking here!

01:07:09.367 --> 01:07:12.403
If he dies, you die.

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:24.381
This is gonna hurt.

01:07:44.803 --> 01:07:47.271
House meeting in the den.

01:07:50.508 --> 01:07:51.842
Now.

01:07:53.478 --> 01:07:55.512
Come on, baby.

01:08:16.501 --> 01:08:20.370
As we can all agree, I think
this situation has really...

01:08:21.606 --> 01:08:25.375
gone off the rails.
I'm not the bad guy.

01:08:25.377 --> 01:08:29.145
I just want to get out of here
in one piece, that's all.

01:08:29.148 --> 01:08:33.283
So what can we do
to make that happen?

01:08:34.685 --> 01:08:37.587
Emmy, what were you
doing out in the woods?

01:08:37.590 --> 01:08:41.692
First I want to know why your
son attacked my daughter.

01:08:41.694 --> 01:08:45.395
Look, Charlie, whatever
happened, it's done.

01:08:45.397 --> 01:08:48.499
I think we'll all agree that we need to
figure out a way to get out of here.

01:08:48.501 --> 01:08:51.702
Don't you say a word.
Fine, Chuck.

01:08:51.703 --> 01:08:55.538
Jason, why did you attack his daughter?
And don't lie to me.

01:08:56.875 --> 01:08:58.876
She was walking backwards.

01:09:00.345 --> 01:09:02.712
She kept falling.

01:09:02.715 --> 01:09:05.415
She fell and I caught her.

01:09:05.417 --> 01:09:10.187
She pushed me off, and then that
girl hit me with a fucking log.

01:09:12.256 --> 01:09:14.424
You were walking backwards?

01:09:15.727 --> 01:09:17.594
Yeah.

01:09:17.595 --> 01:09:19.429
And I must have made it
to the road,

01:09:19.430 --> 01:09:24.201
because two cars were stopped,
and I heard people talking.

01:09:24.203 --> 01:09:25.836
You heard people talking?
No one was talking.

01:09:25.837 --> 01:09:28.872
Yes, there were, and after you
attacked me, they were gone.

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:31.408
I didn't attack you!
Enough!

01:09:34.379 --> 01:09:35.679
OK.

01:09:37.348 --> 01:09:39.683
Nobody goes back into
those woods except me.

01:09:39.685 --> 01:09:41.350
Oh, you're keeping us
hostage here now?

01:09:41.353 --> 01:09:44.621
We're all being kept hostage.
What about him?

01:09:47.524 --> 01:09:49.826
If this thing only wants
one of our families,

01:09:49.828 --> 01:09:53.697
then understand this,
it won't be us.

01:10:15.787 --> 01:10:17.521
Mom!

01:10:58.863 --> 01:11:01.431
If you help me up, I can go.

01:11:04.535 --> 01:11:06.737
I hate leaving you with them.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.807
I don't trust 'em.

01:11:25.890 --> 01:11:27.691
That should last.

01:11:31.829 --> 01:11:33.897
What if something happens to
you when you're out there?

01:11:33.899 --> 01:11:36.533
What then?

01:11:36.535 --> 01:11:39.036
Nice try, Chuck.

01:11:39.038 --> 01:11:43.940
Your son's wounds need to be cleaned.
I know that he needs help,

01:11:43.942 --> 01:11:48.479
but I'm not going to have you running
around after what you did to him.

01:11:48.981 --> 01:11:50.614
Jason.

01:11:50.616 --> 01:11:53.483
I will be back for you.

01:12:23.881 --> 01:12:25.816
Take it easy.

01:12:25.818 --> 01:12:29.519
Everybody, just take it easy,
we're gonna get out of this.

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:39.529
You know I'm getting
out of here, right?

01:12:39.531 --> 01:12:42.099
What makes you so sure any of us
are getting out of here, huh?

01:12:42.101 --> 01:12:47.404
Well, I don't know if we're getting
out of here, but I know you're not.

01:12:56.047 --> 01:13:00.016
It's a shame to leave a sweet
piece of ass like you here.

01:13:00.018 --> 01:13:01.985
You know why you're shivering?

01:13:01.987 --> 01:13:05.589
Because your body's lost so much blood
it can't keep itself warm, asshole.

01:13:05.591 --> 01:13:07.057
Shut up, bitch!

01:13:10.061 --> 01:13:12.396
You're in mild shock by now, too.

01:13:12.398 --> 01:13:13.964
I said shut up!

01:13:13.966 --> 01:13:17.667
What did you see out there, Jason?
I saw you in the field.

01:13:17.669 --> 01:13:20.971
You said she deserved to die.
Who deserved to die?

01:13:20.973 --> 01:13:22.773
Shut up!

01:13:32.083 --> 01:13:36.686
What's happening?
He's having a seizure.

01:13:43.495 --> 01:13:45.162
We have to get that!

01:13:46.631 --> 01:13:49.733
Oh, you guys, we have to get it!

01:13:49.735 --> 01:13:51.668
Give me your hand.
Untie me.

01:13:56.641 --> 01:13:58.475
Hurry.

01:14:13.192 --> 01:14:15.125
Hello?

01:14:15.127 --> 01:14:19.095
Only one lucky family will
call this house their home.

01:14:19.097 --> 01:14:20.997
Fuck you!

01:14:29.741 --> 01:14:31.107
Jason, Jason!

01:14:31.109 --> 01:14:32.843
Jason!

01:14:32.845 --> 01:14:34.244
There's nothing here,
there's nothing here.

01:14:34.246 --> 01:14:39.082
Are you all right? Huh?
Bitch was on me.

01:14:39.084 --> 01:14:42.986
Who was on you?
I don't know who she was.

01:14:42.988 --> 01:14:47.557
Have you seen her before?
Have you?

01:14:47.559 --> 01:14:50.994
Yes.
Where?

01:14:50.996 --> 01:14:54.164
When I hit that deer
a couple of months ago.

01:14:54.166 --> 01:14:55.732
Yeah?

01:14:57.902 --> 01:15:00.570
It wasn't a deer.

01:15:00.572 --> 01:15:04.908
You hit a person?
Yes!

01:15:06.911 --> 01:15:09.946
Some woman was jogging at night.

01:15:09.948 --> 01:15:12.883
It was like four miles from here.

01:15:15.019 --> 01:15:17.587
Fuck! She was running at night!

01:15:19.123 --> 01:15:23.727
What did you do?
I left.

01:15:30.902 --> 01:15:35.238
What happened in the woods?
She fucking hit me with a log!

01:15:35.240 --> 01:15:39.776
With Emmy.
Did you attack her?

01:15:41.946 --> 01:15:46.316
Jesus, Dad, don't buy into their shit!
Shut up.

01:15:57.595 --> 01:16:01.798
You made it... to the road.

01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:15.178
Let's get out of here.

01:16:17.949 --> 01:16:19.282
No!

01:16:22.820 --> 01:16:25.655
No!

01:16:25.657 --> 01:16:27.657
Dad!

01:16:34.999 --> 01:16:36.666
Dad, the gun!

01:16:42.807 --> 01:16:45.909
Give me the fucking gun!
Give it to me!

01:16:45.911 --> 01:16:47.944
Give it to me!

01:16:56.087 --> 01:17:00.190
Don.
Don, how did you do it?

01:17:00.192 --> 01:17:04.761
How did you get to the road?
Don, how did you get to the road?

01:17:13.871 --> 01:17:18.308
He was going to kill us!
No, he wasn't.

01:17:20.745 --> 01:17:22.946
What do you mean?

01:17:27.985 --> 01:17:29.786
Don't leave.

01:17:34.692 --> 01:17:37.661
Don't do this!

01:17:37.663 --> 01:17:39.996
Charlie, don't do this!

01:17:51.709 --> 01:17:53.410
6485.

01:17:53.412 --> 01:17:55.679
Feel free to take a look around.

01:17:57.983 --> 01:18:00.216
Feel free to take a look around.

01:18:06.090 --> 01:18:08.692
Do you think there are only five?

01:18:25.843 --> 01:18:27.410
What now?

01:18:31.015 --> 01:18:33.016
I don't know.

01:18:37.488 --> 01:18:39.389
Without food...

01:18:41.258 --> 01:18:44.994
I want to go home.
You are at home.

01:19:34.145 --> 01:19:36.513
This was their house.

01:19:57.067 --> 01:19:58.902
Hey.

01:20:03.174 --> 01:20:05.108
Is that the woman?

01:20:11.081 --> 01:20:12.582
Go to hell.

01:20:46.217 --> 01:20:51.288
Emmy thinks her mom left me,
that she met somebody else.

01:20:51.590 --> 01:20:53.423
Just tell her.

01:20:53.425 --> 01:20:56.326
She'd never forgive me,
and she'd hate you even more.

01:20:56.328 --> 01:20:59.529
Charlie, got to hell.

01:20:59.531 --> 01:21:03.299
You made your decision, I'm not
gonna live with your guilt!

01:21:13.978 --> 01:21:18.114
Why don't you tell her?
Tell her.

01:21:18.116 --> 01:21:22.118
Shut up.
You brought it up.

01:21:45.910 --> 01:21:48.278
You want...

01:21:48.280 --> 01:21:50.680
Susan to look at your wound?

01:21:50.682 --> 01:21:54.150
Do you want Susan
to look at your wound?

01:21:58.389 --> 01:22:00.256
Don't touch him.

01:22:02.593 --> 01:22:05.395
Don't you dare touch him.

01:22:05.397 --> 01:22:07.530
No, stop.

01:23:39.490 --> 01:23:43.226
I'd rather starve to death than
eat any more of that stuff.

01:23:52.202 --> 01:23:54.804
I want you to take this,
hide it in your jacket,

01:23:54.806 --> 01:23:56.706
and don't go anywhere without it.

01:23:56.708 --> 01:23:58.341
Why?

01:24:00.344 --> 01:24:04.047
I'm going to try
to get to the road.

01:24:04.049 --> 01:24:06.516
It's not safe.

01:24:06.518 --> 01:24:10.319
Either I get to the road
or we all die here.

01:24:10.321 --> 01:24:13.156
It's as simple as that.

01:24:18.395 --> 01:24:20.797
But what if you don't come back?

01:24:23.834 --> 01:24:26.169
I'll make it back.

01:24:28.272 --> 01:24:29.705
I promise.

01:25:13.617 --> 01:25:15.585
You going out there?

01:25:17.855 --> 01:25:19.555
Yeah.

01:25:51.155 --> 01:25:52.922
Just wait a second.

01:25:54.725 --> 01:25:58.461
Whatever happens here,
I want you to know...

01:25:58.463 --> 01:26:02.865
no one thought your mother
was gonna kill herself, OK?

01:26:02.867 --> 01:26:04.700
What do you mean?

01:26:04.702 --> 01:26:09.673
I mean your father and I were seeing each
other for a year before your mother died.

01:26:10.275 --> 01:26:12.675
Why are you telling me this?

01:26:12.677 --> 01:26:15.178
I thought you should know.

01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:18.881
When your father told
your mother about us...

01:26:18.883 --> 01:26:22.185
he couldn't have known
what she was gonna do.

01:26:22.187 --> 01:26:23.786
Right?

01:26:31.328 --> 01:26:34.797
My dad says she met someone else.

01:26:34.799 --> 01:26:37.366
No.

01:26:37.368 --> 01:26:40.570
Your father was worried
about a messy divorce.

01:26:40.572 --> 01:26:43.472
Maybe she was, too.

01:26:43.474 --> 01:26:45.274
You little bitch!

01:26:46.843 --> 01:26:49.679
If I had known I was gonna
have to put up with you,

01:26:49.681 --> 01:26:53.449
I would have thought twice about
marrying your fucking father!

01:27:00.791 --> 01:27:03.359
I'll do it. I will!

01:27:04.928 --> 01:27:06.629
Do it.

01:27:08.365 --> 01:27:09.932
That's her!

01:27:25.482 --> 01:27:27.316
Hello?

01:27:28.852 --> 01:27:30.920
Hello?

01:27:35.525 --> 01:27:37.326
Is there somebody there?

01:27:41.999 --> 01:27:44.467
Well.

01:27:44.469 --> 01:27:47.903
Are you just gonna stand there?

01:27:49.606 --> 01:27:53.509
Have you...
been here...

01:27:53.511 --> 01:27:55.478
the whole time?

01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:58.914
I need to get us out of here.

01:27:58.916 --> 01:28:02.718
There are bigger issues to
deal with at the moment.

01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:06.389
Really?
Oh, yeah.

01:28:06.391 --> 01:28:07.690
What?

01:28:07.692 --> 01:28:13.596
Susan is gonna tell
Emmy about Diane.

01:28:13.598 --> 01:28:17.566
She doesn't know.
Maybe she figured it out.

01:28:17.568 --> 01:28:20.569
I never told her.

01:28:20.571 --> 01:28:23.072
I never told anyone.

01:28:23.074 --> 01:28:27.410
It was an accident, right?
You wanted out.

01:28:27.412 --> 01:28:29.745
We wanted Susan.

01:28:29.747 --> 01:28:32.315
It looked like a suicide.

01:28:32.317 --> 01:28:35.318
We got a second chance.

01:28:35.320 --> 01:28:39.722
And now Susan is going
to tell Emmy the truth,

01:28:39.724 --> 01:28:42.525
Emmy won't be able to take it.

01:28:42.527 --> 01:28:45.695
And then there's the girl.

01:28:45.697 --> 01:28:47.730
What about her?

01:28:47.732 --> 01:28:51.667
Well, she isn't part
of this family.

01:28:51.669 --> 01:28:55.037
There won't be any help

01:28:55.039 --> 01:28:59.709
till all the problems in
that house are dealt with.

01:29:36.680 --> 01:29:38.381
Emmy?

01:29:48.892 --> 01:29:50.659
What happened?

01:29:54.131 --> 01:29:56.766
You said Mom met someone.

01:29:59.669 --> 01:30:01.804
What really happened?

01:30:04.441 --> 01:30:07.476
Did Susan do this?
What did she tell you?

01:30:08.979 --> 01:30:12.014
It was an accident.

01:30:12.016 --> 01:30:13.983
What was?

01:30:20.457 --> 01:30:24.693
I had nothing to do with it.
With what?

01:30:28.632 --> 01:30:31.567
It's all going to be OK.

01:30:33.537 --> 01:30:36.939
Once we clear all this up...

01:30:38.809 --> 01:30:40.743
we can leave.

01:30:50.654 --> 01:30:52.455
Susan!

01:31:15.745 --> 01:31:18.914
What are you doing?
I'm getting out of here.

01:31:21.985 --> 01:31:24.820
How?
I'm going to walk.

01:31:28.492 --> 01:31:30.659
What did you tell Emmy?

01:31:34.564 --> 01:31:37.266
Let me go.
You bitch.

01:31:37.268 --> 01:31:41.704
You wanted this, Charlie.
You're gonna have to pay for it.

01:31:45.542 --> 01:31:47.142
You?

01:31:47.144 --> 01:31:48.844
I didn't put them there.

01:31:48.846 --> 01:31:50.647
Then how did they get there?
I don't know!

01:31:50.648 --> 01:31:52.915
You're taking food out of
my daughter's mouth...

01:31:52.917 --> 01:31:56.051
I said I did not put them there!

01:31:58.154 --> 01:32:01.624
I don't care about your
precious daughter.

01:32:01.626 --> 01:32:03.025
Get off of me!

01:32:45.869 --> 01:32:48.337
What did you do?

01:32:48.339 --> 01:32:50.606
You just got to understand.

01:32:52.976 --> 01:32:55.144
She was gonna destroy us.

01:32:57.614 --> 01:32:59.715
Did you kill her?

01:32:59.717 --> 01:33:05.388
We're this much closer
to being able to leave.

01:33:07.924 --> 01:33:11.093
There's only the girl now.

01:33:11.095 --> 01:33:12.995
Don't you trust me?

01:33:12.997 --> 01:33:16.632
When you said "an accident,"

01:33:16.634 --> 01:33:20.703
what did you mean?
Why, are you afraid?

01:33:20.705 --> 01:33:22.104
Please?

01:33:23.707 --> 01:33:26.709
It's you and me, kiddo.

01:33:26.711 --> 01:33:29.645
We've got to stick together.

01:33:29.647 --> 01:33:34.783
We don't even know
who this girl is.

01:33:34.785 --> 01:33:37.886
What did you mean
about an accident?

01:33:39.089 --> 01:33:43.993
Did you mean Mom?
Emmy.

01:33:45.895 --> 01:33:47.930
Come here.

01:33:49.633 --> 01:33:53.335
Leave the girl.
She cannot go with us.

01:33:53.337 --> 01:33:57.806
Please, Dad!
Get back.

01:33:59.909 --> 01:34:01.710
Emmy.

01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:06.148
I'm your father.

01:34:06.150 --> 01:34:09.418
I know what's right.

01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:12.187
She's part of this.

01:34:12.189 --> 01:34:14.923
You have to let me handle it.

01:34:19.362 --> 01:34:20.996
Emmy.

01:34:22.699 --> 01:34:26.301
Do not make me angry.

01:34:26.303 --> 01:34:27.836
Hmm?

01:34:27.838 --> 01:34:31.907
Do you know what
I just did for you?

01:34:31.909 --> 01:34:34.443
She was taking the food,

01:34:34.745 --> 01:34:38.280
taking the food out of
my daughter's mouth.

01:34:38.282 --> 01:34:40.115
I could not have that happen.

01:34:40.117 --> 01:34:43.352
I would never let anyone hurt you.

01:34:43.354 --> 01:34:45.721

Be careful.

01:37:27.284 --> 01:37:30.853
Watch her head.
Come on, come on, come on.
