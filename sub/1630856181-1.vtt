00:04.750 --> 00:07.625
[suspenseful music]

00:16.542 --> 00:17.625
[Gideon] Hello?

00:19.500 --> 00:20.833
Anyone there?

00:20.917 --> 00:24.042
[suspenseful music]

00:41.333 --> 00:42.542
Hey?

00:47.292 --> 00:50.083
[lightning clapping]

01:03.333 --> 01:04.375
[gasps]

01:09.875 --> 01:12.708
[elevator whirring]

01:22.542 --> 01:24.042
Turn around!

01:26.708 --> 01:28.458
-Gideon.
-Paul?

01:28.542 --> 01:30.292
[Paul] What are you doing here?

01:32.167 --> 01:33.917
[Mallory] Gideon knew
the next words out of her mouth

01:34.000 --> 01:36.667
would be among the most
important she would ever speak.

01:38.917 --> 01:41.083
If her suspicions proved correct

01:41.167 --> 01:43.083
and her uncle
really was the monster

01:43.167 --> 01:45.083
who poisoned her aunt,

01:45.167 --> 01:47.167
then she just might be
the second member

01:47.250 --> 01:49.500
of the Snow family
to die that week.

01:49.542 --> 01:51.958
She knew she had to say
something very smart,

01:52.042 --> 01:54.125
very quickly.

01:54.208 --> 01:57.458
She looked into her
uncle's eyes and said...

02:01.042 --> 02:02.708
you'll just have to buy
the book to find out.

02:02.792 --> 02:05.208
[laughter]

02:05.333 --> 02:06.250
[Michael] Thank you, Mallory.

02:06.333 --> 02:08.000
One more time, everyone.

02:08.042 --> 02:09.333
-Mallory Dearborn.
-Thank you.

02:09.417 --> 02:11.833
-[Michael] Yeah.
-Thank you.

02:11.958 --> 02:13.208
[cheers and applause]

02:13.292 --> 02:15.042
[man] Hey, Mallory.

02:15.167 --> 02:17.542
[indistinct]

02:17.667 --> 02:18.750
Wow.

02:20.042 --> 02:21.458
Thank you.

02:24.583 --> 02:27.042
[Michael] Don't worry.
They limit the presales to 100.

02:27.167 --> 02:28.167
-Why?
-I thought you'd be tired

02:28.333 --> 02:29.375
after the long day.

02:29.500 --> 02:30.958
I always have time for the fans.

02:31.042 --> 02:32.167
Besides, it's not every day
you could have a signed copy

02:32.292 --> 02:34.333
of the very last Gideon
Snow novel.

02:34.375 --> 02:36.500
Speaking of which,
how did it go with Wendy

02:36.583 --> 02:38.500
about this being my last one?

02:38.542 --> 02:40.208
Mal, the book just came out.

02:40.292 --> 02:43.000
[chuckles] You haven't told her.

02:43.042 --> 02:44.792
We'll talk about this later.
Okay?

02:44.875 --> 02:47.250
[Mallory] Michael, she's been
my publisher for 10 years.

02:47.375 --> 02:48.583
She deserves to know.

02:48.708 --> 02:50.625
And she will. I promise.

02:50.708 --> 02:52.458
You honestly think I'll let
my favorite client down?

02:52.542 --> 02:54.583
Why do I get the feeling you say
that to all your clients?

02:54.667 --> 02:57.125
[Michael] Hmm. Okay. What
are we waiting for, Christmas?

02:57.208 --> 02:59.167
-Thank you.
-Let's go. Let's go.

02:59.250 --> 03:01.167
Mallory Dearborn.

03:01.250 --> 03:02.833
There's no bigger fan than me.

03:02.917 --> 03:05.542
I talk about you all the time
on my podcast.

03:05.667 --> 03:08.250
Um, Carrie Addison.

03:08.333 --> 03:11.250
-Uh...
-The Mystery Maven.

03:11.333 --> 03:12.708
It's very nice to meet you.

03:12.708 --> 03:14.167
-Who should I make this out to?
-[Carrie] Carrie.

03:14.208 --> 03:16.167
-[Mallory] Carrie.
-Carrie Addison.

03:17.375 --> 03:19.167
I'm not
just a podcast host, though.

03:19.292 --> 03:21.500
I'm a mystery writer, too.

03:21.542 --> 03:24.917
Well, aspiring anyway,
you know as well.

03:25.000 --> 03:26.125
Enjoy the book, Carrie.

03:26.208 --> 03:28.417
Um, Gideon Snow

03:28.417 --> 03:31.833
is my favorite
literary character of all time.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.375
I don't know what I would do

03:33.375 --> 03:34.833
if you ever stopped
writing these.

03:37.208 --> 03:38.583
Okay. Let's keep it moving.

03:38.708 --> 03:40.042
I just also wanted
to tell you that--

03:40.125 --> 03:41.500
[Michael] A lot of people
to get through.

03:43.042 --> 03:44.458
Thank you.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.792
-Hi.
-Hi. Made out to?

03:47.875 --> 03:50.125
[woman] Carolyn, please.

03:50.208 --> 03:52.375
-Thanks.
-Thank you.

03:57.667 --> 03:59.917
Why does Wendy care so much
about another

04:00.000 --> 04:01.208
Gideon novel anyway?

04:01.292 --> 04:02.750
Wise-ass detectives
are like a dime a dozen.

04:02.833 --> 04:04.458
Well, not the way
you write 'em, Mal.

04:04.542 --> 04:06.292
Look, if you need a break,
take a break.

04:06.375 --> 04:08.167
You deserve a vacation
after all the hard work

04:08.250 --> 04:09.333
you've done
promoting the new book.

04:09.375 --> 04:12.000
A vacation
is not gonna fix this, Michael.

04:12.083 --> 04:13.500
Don't get me wrong.
I love my fans.

04:13.583 --> 04:16.000
I love Gideon,
but when am I gonna get

04:16.083 --> 04:17.958
the chance
to write something for me?

04:18.042 --> 04:19.375
Soon, right, I promise.

04:19.458 --> 04:22.667
Come on.
Just, hey, one more, one more.

04:22.708 --> 04:23.958
Do you know
how many times I've said that

04:24.042 --> 04:25.458
to myself over the years?

04:25.542 --> 04:26.833
Well, what'd you even write
about? What?

04:26.958 --> 04:28.292
A new detective,
a new cast of characters?

04:28.417 --> 04:29.500
No, no, no, no, no.

04:29.625 --> 04:31.292
No more thrillers,
no more mysteries.

04:31.375 --> 04:34.750
I wanna write a novel
that actually means something.

04:34.750 --> 04:36.083
You know, something
you can't just pick up

04:36.167 --> 04:38.542
at an airport
or read on the beach.

04:38.625 --> 04:40.833
So, in other words, a book
that won't make any money?

04:40.958 --> 04:42.250
I'm not doing it for money.

04:42.333 --> 04:43.500
I'm doing it for me.

04:43.583 --> 04:45.083
Well, I hate to be the bearer
of bad news,

04:45.208 --> 04:47.083
but some of us do work
on commission.

04:47.167 --> 04:48.833
This guy.

04:48.875 --> 04:52.667
Michael, you believed in me
when no one else did.

04:52.750 --> 04:55.333
And you've been my agent
a long time.

04:55.417 --> 04:57.292
And so while I don't know
what this next chapter

04:57.375 --> 05:00.333
is gonna lead, I do hope
that you'll be a part of it.

05:02.542 --> 05:04.167
You're exhausted.

05:04.208 --> 05:06.833
Let's talk about this
more tomorrow. Okay?

05:06.875 --> 05:08.292
-Okay.
-Okay.

05:08.375 --> 05:09.583
Get some rest.

05:14.042 --> 05:15.167
To be continued.

of position that puts me in?

I'm calling my lawyer.

Well, let your heart
not be troubled.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.500
I come bearing Christmas gifts.

07:10.625 --> 07:12.083
It's not Christmas yet.

07:12.167 --> 07:13.458
Well, fine. If you don't want
the croissants,

07:13.583 --> 07:14.833
-I can just--
-From DeNucci's?

07:14.875 --> 07:16.875
-Where else?
-[Mallory] Fair enough.

07:16.958 --> 07:18.750
You can stay. [giggles]

07:21.042 --> 07:23.500
So have you, uh,

07:23.542 --> 07:26.833
given any thought
about what we talked about?

07:26.875 --> 07:29.125
I thought
about it all night actually.

07:29.208 --> 07:30.042
I could barely sleep.

07:30.167 --> 07:31.667
And?

07:31.750 --> 07:34.125
Well, Gideon Snow has been
very good to me

07:34.208 --> 07:36.000
for both of us.

07:37.042 --> 07:39.250
But I became a writer
to write all kinds of books,

07:39.333 --> 07:40.625
not just Gideon Snow novels.

07:40.708 --> 07:42.750
What about the fans?

07:42.875 --> 07:44.458
What about 'em?

07:44.542 --> 07:46.292
Well, aren't you afraid
of letting them down?

07:46.375 --> 07:47.958
The opposite actually.

07:48.042 --> 07:49.958
I wanna give them something
brand new to be excited about,

07:50.042 --> 07:52.000
you know, something
that they've never seen before.

07:52.083 --> 07:55.208
What better way to show them
how much I appreciate them?

07:55.292 --> 07:56.833
And Wendy?

07:58.750 --> 08:00.583
I'll honor the agreement,

08:00.667 --> 08:02.833
but for a new book.

08:02.875 --> 08:04.042
Michael, don't look so glum.

08:04.167 --> 08:05.875
It's not like I'm giving up
writing forever.

08:05.958 --> 08:09.333
If I miss Gideon,
I can always pay her a visit

08:09.375 --> 08:10.708
somewhere down the road,

08:10.792 --> 08:12.500
just like long down the road.

08:12.583 --> 08:13.667
[Michael] Of course.

08:14.792 --> 08:16.208
Of course.

08:16.292 --> 08:18.750
I don't mean to make things
difficult for you, Michael.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.333
If you think it would help,
I'd be happy to sit down

08:20.375 --> 08:21.625
with Wendy
and talk to her myself.

08:21.708 --> 08:24.042
No. No, no. I'll handle Wendy.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.917
Just do me a favor.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.000
Don't say anything
to anybody just yet.

08:28.042 --> 08:30.667
Okay? I think we owe it
to her to hear from me first.

08:32.333 --> 08:33.458
Of course.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.458
So this new book...

08:36.833 --> 08:38.292
any idea
what you wanna write about?

08:38.375 --> 08:39.750
[Mallory] I don't know.

08:39.833 --> 08:41.042
Honestly, I've been
in the Gideon Snow business

08:41.125 --> 08:44.000
for so long, I think
I'd just take the holidays

08:44.042 --> 08:48.125
and recharge, you know?

08:48.208 --> 08:51.167
[dramatic music]

08:55.375 --> 08:57.583
[Michael] Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice, Wendy.

08:57.583 --> 08:59.208
Considering what you told me
over the phone,

08:59.292 --> 09:00.833
I didn't have much of a choice.

09:00.917 --> 09:03.417
I know. I know.

09:03.417 --> 09:05.875
She's a special writer, Michael.

09:05.958 --> 09:08.083
Well, you don't have to tell me.

09:08.167 --> 09:10.792
-She's made up her mind.
-Then change it.

09:10.875 --> 09:12.500
I've already tried everything.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.500
She does realize
that she's agreed

09:14.542 --> 09:16.833
to give us another title.

09:16.917 --> 09:19.083
-She does.
-[Wendy] And she is aware

09:19.167 --> 09:21.667
that we've already paid her
a handsome advance

09:21.750 --> 09:23.875
for another Gideon novel,
isn't she?

09:26.708 --> 09:28.708
Well, if she doesn't deliver,

09:28.708 --> 09:31.167
I'll have no choice but to sue.

09:31.250 --> 09:32.708
And not just for the advance,

09:32.833 --> 09:35.583
for damages
due to lost royalties.

09:36.542 --> 09:38.292
[phone rings]

09:38.375 --> 09:40.458
Wait a minute.

09:40.542 --> 09:43.542

doesn't she?

09:46.208 --> 09:47.333
Michael.

09:47.417 --> 09:48.792
I just need a little time.

09:48.875 --> 09:51.208
I'll return it, plus interest.

09:55.208 --> 09:56.458
Okay.

09:56.542 --> 09:58.000
I'll give you a couple months.

09:58.083 --> 10:01.042
And that's only
because of our history together.

10:17.000 --> 10:19.833
Hmm. Thanks for meeting me.

10:19.917 --> 10:22.708
You said you had good news.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.833
Well, I, uh, I met with Wendy.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.958
-And?
-And she's on board.

10:29.042 --> 10:30.167
You're serious?

10:30.250 --> 10:31.875
I'm not gonna joke
about something like that.

10:31.958 --> 10:33.500
-Just like that.
-Well, there is one

10:33.542 --> 10:34.750
little thing.

10:34.833 --> 10:35.667
-Of course.
-[Michael] No, no, no.

10:35.750 --> 10:36.625
It's not terrible.

10:36.708 --> 10:38.833
Not terrible.

10:38.958 --> 10:40.833
Do you remember the winter home
I have up in the mountains?

10:40.917 --> 10:42.542
I've heard you talk about it,
but I don't think

10:42.625 --> 10:45.000
-I've ever been there.
-Oh. Um,

10:45.083 --> 10:46.750
excuse me, oh...

10:48.583 --> 10:51.000
-take it.
-What is this?

10:51.083 --> 10:52.000
[Michael] Well, you said
you wanted

10:52.083 --> 10:53.542
to take the holidays
to recharge.

10:53.625 --> 10:54.750
Yeah. But I didn't need--

10:54.833 --> 10:55.958
[Michael] Oh, you'll love it.

10:56.042 --> 10:57.667
I just decorated it
for the holidays.

10:57.750 --> 10:59.333
It's isolated.

10:59.417 --> 11:02.542
It's got a gorgeous library,
a great big writing desk.

11:02.667 --> 11:04.667
Plus they just got
a little dusting of snow.

11:04.708 --> 11:06.667
So you'll be able
to have yourself

11:06.750 --> 11:08.125
a merry little Christmas.

11:08.208 --> 11:10.250
I'm not gonna change
my mind, Michael.

11:10.375 --> 11:11.667
[Michael] I know. I know.

11:11.708 --> 11:14.167
But you've seemed so down
since your parents died.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.500
I think it would do you good
to get away for a few weeks.

But I also know that you get
antsy when you don't write.

[suspenseful music]

25:54.708 --> 25:56.500
It takes me a year
to write a novel,

25:56.542 --> 25:57.625
-you know that, right?
-[Michael] No, no.

25:57.708 --> 25:59.000
it takes a year
to publish a novel.

25:59.125 --> 26:01.458
And that's just mainly
a strategic decision

26:01.542 --> 26:02.875

plus that's with all

26:03.000 --> 26:05.125
the usual distractions,
procrastinations,

26:05.208 --> 26:07.208
which lucky for you,

26:08.333 --> 26:10.208
won't be a problem this time.

26:14.000 --> 26:17.375
75,000 words,

26:17.458 --> 26:18.625

26:19.958 --> 26:21.083

26:21.167 --> 26:23.167
So I think if you devote
a hundred percent

26:23.208 --> 26:25.250
of your time to your craft,

26:25.333 --> 26:29.417
we could bump that up

something we both don't want.

27:23.833 --> 27:26.583
Trust me, you don't want
that on your conscience.

27:29.708 --> 27:31.625
Why don't you start
writing while I'm gone?

27:38.292 --> 27:39.750
Oh, thank God.

27:39.833 --> 27:41.375
I wasn't sure
if anyone lived here

27:41.458 --> 27:42.500
and then I saw
the cars out front,

27:42.583 --> 27:43.458
I thought maybe I would just--

27:43.542 --> 27:44.792
Can I--can I help you?

27:44.875 --> 27:46.333
Actually, you can.

27:46.375 --> 27:48.250
I'm renting a B&B
a couple miles from here,

27:48.333 --> 27:50.667
thought I'd go for a hike
in the woods, you know,

27:50.750 --> 27:52.167
get back to nature and all that,

27:52.208 --> 27:53.500
which seemed like
a good idea at the time

27:53.625 --> 27:55.583
but somehow I ended up here.

27:55.667 --> 27:56.667
[Michael] Well,
it happens all the time.

27:56.750 --> 27:58.042
These woods
aren't too forgiving.

27:58.042 --> 27:59.875
Anyway, can I come
inside for a bit

27:59.958 --> 28:01.500
just to rest for a little while?

28:01.583 --> 28:03.167
I've been walking for hours.

28:03.208 --> 28:04.250
Uh,

28:07.208 --> 28:08.708
please, yeah.

28:08.792 --> 28:09.958
-Come in.
-Thanks, man.

28:10.042 --> 28:11.667
-You're a lifesaver.
-Michael, by the way.

28:11.750 --> 28:13.917
-Grant.
-Nice to meet you, Grant.

28:20.750 --> 28:24.500
[muffled moaning]

28:24.542 --> 28:26.542
[Grant] Sweet place, man.

28:26.625 --> 28:27.792
Thank you.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.542
It's my little getaway
from the city.

28:29.625 --> 28:30.875
You all alone out here?

28:31.792 --> 28:33.500
That's the point, isn't it?

28:33.542 --> 28:34.750
You're telling me.

28:34.833 --> 28:36.792
I come out every year
just to get away.

28:40.875 --> 28:42.292
This is just what I needed.

28:44.333 --> 28:46.583
So what is it you do
back in the city?

28:46.667 --> 28:47.792
Literary agent.

28:47.875 --> 28:49.292
[Grant] Really? Like authors?

28:49.375 --> 28:50.208
[Michael] That's right.

28:51.333 --> 28:52.792
Anyone famous?

28:52.875 --> 28:54.667
Depends on your
definition of famous.

28:54.708 --> 28:55.833
[laughs]

28:55.917 --> 28:57.542
I wouldn't know.
I'm not much of a reader.

28:57.667 --> 28:59.250
Hmm. Shocker.

29:09.833 --> 29:12.500
Hey, do you mind
if I use your bathroom?

29:12.500 --> 29:13.458
I haven't had a leak in hours.

29:14.833 --> 29:16.000
Not at all.

29:25.292 --> 29:26.792
No, no, no, no.

29:26.875 --> 29:29.458
The bathroom is down there.

29:29.583 --> 29:31.667
-What was that?
-Hmm?

29:31.708 --> 29:32.875
I thought you said
you were alone?

29:32.875 --> 29:34.000
[muffled screaming]

29:34.083 --> 29:35.708
[Grant] Is someone in there?

29:35.833 --> 29:36.875
I think you should go.

29:36.958 --> 29:38.375
I think I should
check it out first.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.208
I insist.

29:40.333 --> 29:41.417
Do you mind?

29:52.792 --> 29:54.167
[muffled screaming]

29:54.208 --> 29:55.375
What the...

29:58.375 --> 29:59.417
[Mallory] Michael.

30:17.625 --> 30:19.792
[panting]

30:38.458 --> 30:39.917
I warned you.

30:41.208 --> 30:43.417
I told you to keep quiet
and now look what you've done.

30:45.292 --> 30:48.333
You didn't follow the rules
and now a man is dead.

30:50.583 --> 30:51.958
You think this is a game?

30:53.375 --> 30:54.792
I didn't mean what I said?

30:58.375 --> 30:59.417
Now you know.

31:05.542 --> 31:06.875
Get away from me, Michael.

31:06.958 --> 31:08.667
-Stop it.
-[Mallory] No. I'm serious.

31:08.750 --> 31:10.083
I'm not going anywhere with you.

31:11.833 --> 31:12.958
Fine.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.917
It can wait tomorrow.

31:25.375 --> 31:26.250
[sighs]

31:41.667 --> 31:42.625
[gasps]

31:42.708 --> 31:43.625
[door closes]

31:45.792 --> 31:46.833
Morning, Janice.

31:46.875 --> 31:47.833
[Janice] Morning, Sheriff.

31:47.958 --> 31:48.833
Some coffee?

31:48.958 --> 31:50.958
I'll get it myself, thank you.

31:51.875 --> 31:53.667
Anything come in overnight?

31:53.792 --> 31:55.292
No. Well,

31:55.375 --> 31:58.708
we did receive one call
but it was just a hang-up.

31:58.792 --> 32:00.458
Figured it was an accident.

32:00.542 --> 32:02.083
-Landline?
-[Janice] Um...

32:02.208 --> 32:05.208
cell phone right off
of County Road 19.

32:07.375 --> 32:08.333
Huh.

32:09.292 --> 32:10.417
Do you think it's something?

32:10.500 --> 32:11.500
[Sheriff Hill] No.

32:11.542 --> 32:12.875
You're probably right.

32:18.167 --> 32:21.417
Still, it wouldn't hurt
to take a look out there.

32:21.542 --> 32:22.958
Just to be safe.

32:24.375 --> 32:26.292
[dramatic music]

32:32.750 --> 32:33.792
[Mallory sighing]

32:33.875 --> 32:35.917
[dramatic music]

32:44.417 --> 32:45.333
[sighs]

33:01.875 --> 33:03.125
[knock on door]

33:07.417 --> 33:09.083
I know you're not much
of a breakfast person,

33:09.167 --> 33:10.750
but I assume you would
need the strength,

33:10.875 --> 33:14.375
so I made you some bacon,
eggs, toast,

33:14.500 --> 33:16.750
and black coffee.

33:16.833 --> 33:17.750
[Mallory] Thanks.

33:17.833 --> 33:18.958
But I'm not hungry.

33:20.583 --> 33:22.625
Well, I'll leave it there
in case you change your mind.

33:25.792 --> 33:27.333
-How's it going?
-Good.

33:28.292 --> 33:30.250
-Can I see what you have so--
-Uh...

33:31.625 --> 33:32.833
No?

33:32.917 --> 33:34.250
Never mind. Too soon, right?

33:34.333 --> 33:36.500
You got to get in the groove,
right?

33:36.583 --> 33:37.500
-[chuckles]
-Mmm-hmm.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.500
[doorbell dings]

33:39.542 --> 33:41.958
[tense music]

33:42.042 --> 33:43.167
Stay quiet.

33:46.042 --> 33:47.708
[doorbell dings]

33:52.667 --> 33:54.000
Open.

33:55.542 --> 33:57.542
Not one word.

33:57.625 --> 33:58.583
I mean it.

34:01.375 --> 34:02.625
[sighs]

34:02.708 --> 34:04.583
[doorbell dings]

34:12.542 --> 34:13.542
[sighs]

34:21.292 --> 34:22.958
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.

34:23.042 --> 34:24.125
I hope I'm not bothering you.

34:24.208 --> 34:25.833
[Michael] No, no. Not at all.

34:25.917 --> 34:27.000
How can I help?

34:27.042 --> 34:28.708
I'm Sheriff Hill.

34:28.792 --> 34:29.667
Pleasure, Sheriff.

34:29.708 --> 34:31.625
Um, actually,

34:31.708 --> 34:33.667
I was hoping
for a few minutes of your time.

34:33.792 --> 34:35.167
Of course.

34:37.000 --> 34:40.458
Uh, well, uh,
would you mind if I came in?

34:40.542 --> 34:41.708
No.

34:41.792 --> 34:43.958
Uh, yes, I'm sorry, I just...

34:44.042 --> 34:45.250
[laughs]

34:45.333 --> 34:47.083
I'm just, uh,
a little busy right now.

34:47.167 --> 34:49.000
Uh, I just got here
yesterday and haven't had

34:49.083 --> 34:50.667
a chance to unpack anything.

34:50.792 --> 34:53.333
[Sheriff Hill] Well,
I'm sure I've seen worse.

34:55.792 --> 34:57.583
Of course. Please. Come in.

34:57.667 --> 34:58.750
Come in.

34:58.833 --> 34:59.917
[chuckles]

35:00.000 --> 35:02.042
[dramatic music]

35:06.125 --> 35:08.917
It smells like
somebody's been cookin'.

35:09.042 --> 35:10.792
I just finished my breakfast.

35:14.917 --> 35:16.625
-[laughs]
-I was hungry.

35:18.750 --> 35:19.833
So, you said there was something

35:19.958 --> 35:21.792
that you wanted
to talk to me about?

35:21.875 --> 35:24.083
Uh, the thing is, sir, uh,

35:24.167 --> 35:26.667
we got a 911 call yesterday

35:26.708 --> 35:30.083
from a cell phone tower
not too far from here.

35:31.208 --> 35:32.375
What did they say?

35:32.375 --> 35:34.333
Didn't say anything. Hung up.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.958
Frankly, I'm surprised anybody

35:36.042 --> 35:37.292
get a signal way out here.

35:37.375 --> 35:39.167
[Sheriff Hill] [laughs]
Don't I know it.

35:40.250 --> 35:44.000
Still, um,
you haven't noticed anything

35:44.042 --> 35:46.292
suspicious around here,
have you?

35:46.375 --> 35:47.417
No.

35:47.542 --> 35:49.458
I haven't seen anybody
since I got here.

35:50.583 --> 35:51.833
-This your place?
-[Michael] Family's.

35:51.958 --> 35:53.250
-Well...
-[Sheriff Hill] Oh.

35:53.333 --> 35:54.500
I don't get to spend
a whole lot of time up here,

35:54.583 --> 35:56.500
but my parents did, uh,
before they passed.

35:57.708 --> 35:58.792
My condolences.

35:58.875 --> 36:00.333
Thank you.

36:02.208 --> 36:04.583
[bangs table]

36:08.917 --> 36:10.750
-Do you hear that?
-Hear it?

36:10.833 --> 36:12.167
It nearly kept me up all night.

36:12.208 --> 36:14.125
I had to sleep
with my ear buds in.

36:16.917 --> 36:17.875
What is it?

36:18.000 --> 36:19.417
Uh, it's, uh,

36:20.750 --> 36:23.917
yeah, the pipes,
when the water freezes and...

36:25.167 --> 36:27.000
Huh.

36:27.042 --> 36:29.125
I'd be happy to take a look.

36:29.208 --> 36:31.208
Might only need a few turns
from the wrench.

36:31.292 --> 36:33.292
Oh, I appreciate that
but I called the plumber,

36:33.417 --> 36:34.375
they'll be here later today.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.500
Might save
you a few hundred bucks.

36:36.583 --> 36:38.167
Plumber told me not to touch it.

36:38.333 --> 36:39.500
That's what happened last time.

36:39.625 --> 36:41.083
I guess everyone thinks
they're a handyman.

36:41.208 --> 36:42.542
[laughs]

36:43.750 --> 36:44.708
Well...

36:46.083 --> 36:47.708
I won't keep
you any longer, then.

36:48.667 --> 36:50.792
-Okey-dokey.
-[banging on table]

36:55.792 --> 36:58.000
Oh, uh, can I get your name?

36:58.042 --> 36:59.333
For the report.

36:59.333 --> 37:01.042
Right. Michael.
Michael Harrington.

37:01.125 --> 37:03.625
Uh, oh, in fact...here.

37:03.708 --> 37:06.542
Uh, my cell's on there
so if you need anything,

37:06.625 --> 37:07.917
feel free to give me a call.

37:09.792 --> 37:11.458
I'll do that.

37:11.542 --> 37:12.583
Thank you.

37:14.708 --> 37:16.667
[dramatic music]

37:37.417 --> 37:39.000
I thought we had
an understanding.

37:43.250 --> 37:44.833
He's gonna come back, you know.

37:44.875 --> 37:46.375
Eventually, when that
hiker doesn't show up,

37:46.458 --> 37:48.000
he's gonna come back.

37:48.083 --> 37:49.208
Hey.

37:50.708 --> 37:52.208
I guess you better
get back to work.

38:09.042 --> 38:10.375
[dramatic music]

38:10.375 --> 38:11.833
[Mallory] The lights
reminded her of Christmas.

38:13.708 --> 38:17.708
Only these were the flashing
red and blues of the cop car.

38:17.792 --> 38:20.250
Not the soft white
twinkling teardrops

38:20.333 --> 38:22.542
that decorated every
house on the block.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.333
Gideon kept her head down,

38:26.417 --> 38:28.833
her face tucked
into her fur collar,

38:28.958 --> 38:31.375
as the rough snow, really, ice,

38:31.500 --> 38:33.583
sliced against her face.

38:35.792 --> 38:37.333
Gideon hadn't slept.

38:37.458 --> 38:38.833
She hadn't showered.

38:38.917 --> 38:42.500
Her hair was greasy
and her eyes feral.

38:42.542 --> 38:45.333
Every time she heard the sound
of someone approaching

38:45.458 --> 38:47.875
or felt someone
might be watching,

38:49.500 --> 38:51.292
her breath caught in her chest.

38:52.875 --> 38:56.708
Even in death,
her nemesis had her on edge.

38:59.375 --> 39:01.667
Gideon reached into her pocket.

39:01.750 --> 39:05.542
She caressed the ivory
handle like a warm lover,

39:05.625 --> 39:07.958
only this lover had a bite.

39:08.042 --> 39:09.583
A deadly one.

39:21.958 --> 39:23.833
[owl hoots]

39:28.792 --> 39:29.667
How's it going?

39:32.458 --> 39:33.750
I'm halfway done.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.333
13th.

39:36.417 --> 39:37.792
-Right on schedule.
-[Mallory] Yeah.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.750
The thing is, usually,

39:39.833 --> 39:42.750
when I'm about
halfway done with a book,

39:42.875 --> 39:46.833
I take a minute to recharge
my creative batteries.

39:46.958 --> 39:48.083
What do you have in mind?

39:48.167 --> 39:49.000
[Mallory] A bottle of wine...

39:50.208 --> 39:51.417
and a nice dinner.

39:52.542 --> 39:54.208
Anything else, Your Highness?

39:54.208 --> 39:55.917
You want a book in three weeks?

39:56.042 --> 39:57.750
This is my process.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.042
Why not.

40:04.625 --> 40:05.833
Mind if I freshen up?

40:07.708 --> 40:09.500
I'll call you when it's ready.

40:09.583 --> 40:11.625
[suspenseful music]

40:51.667 --> 40:53.125
You look beautiful.

40:53.250 --> 40:54.417
[scoffs]

40:56.542 --> 40:58.083
Something smells amazing.

40:59.708 --> 41:01.333
Yes. Uh,

41:01.375 --> 41:04.417
seared brook trout
with sage and thyme.

41:04.500 --> 41:07.542
-Hmm.
-Please, sit.

41:07.667 --> 41:10.500
[upbeat music playing]

41:26.625 --> 41:28.583
I know it doesn't go
with the meal

41:29.750 --> 41:31.000
but I can't be too careful.

41:36.375 --> 41:37.458
[sighs]

41:40.917 --> 41:42.000
How is it?

41:42.167 --> 41:43.208
-Hmm.
-Be honest.

41:44.208 --> 41:46.792
I had no idea you were
so talented in the kitchen.

41:46.875 --> 41:47.833
[Michael laughs]

41:47.875 --> 41:49.792
One of my first clients
wrote cookbooks.

41:49.875 --> 41:50.875
Hmm.

41:53.125 --> 41:54.833
I'm not oblivious, Mal.

41:54.917 --> 41:57.792
I know how much you must
loathe me right now.

41:58.958 --> 42:00.792
I think we're way past that,
Michael.

42:02.083 --> 42:03.500
I can't say I blame you.

42:04.750 --> 42:06.333
This isn't exactly
how I envisioned

42:06.375 --> 42:07.500
our partnership ending.

42:07.583 --> 42:09.917
Don't pretend
this was inevitable.

42:10.000 --> 42:11.000
It's beneath you.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.125
Oh, I suppose not.

42:12.208 --> 42:14.875
We all make choices
we have to live with.

42:18.042 --> 42:21.375
You know, in a strange way,
this reminds me of the old days.

42:21.458 --> 42:23.333
-The old days?
-[Michael] Mmm-hmm.

42:24.292 --> 42:28.000
When we first started working
together, our first Gideon book.

42:28.083 --> 42:31.208
[laughs] All those hours I spent
pacing around your office,

42:31.333 --> 42:33.583
encouraging you, reassuring you,

42:33.667 --> 42:36.500
offering my opinion
on every new page.

42:36.542 --> 42:38.833
That was a long time ago.

42:38.917 --> 42:39.917
Yeah, it was.

42:41.125 --> 42:42.042
It really was.

42:44.958 --> 42:46.333
Something wrong with your wine?

42:46.500 --> 42:48.458
Oh. Hmm.

42:48.542 --> 42:50.750
Don't get me wrong,
I love cabernet, but...

42:50.833 --> 42:52.792
-But?
-[Mallory] It's fish.

42:54.292 --> 42:56.083
I don't suppose you have...

42:57.292 --> 42:58.208
white wine?

43:02.208 --> 43:03.083
You're right.

43:04.458 --> 43:06.500
I have just the thing.

43:06.625 --> 43:08.250
[laughs]

43:08.333 --> 43:09.833
In addition to their cold cuts,

43:09.917 --> 43:13.250
that little market has
a surprisingly eclectic

43:13.333 --> 43:14.417
selection of wine.

43:14.500 --> 43:15.667
Oh.

43:15.792 --> 43:18.000
This particular sauvignon

43:18.083 --> 43:20.917
was imported from the
Upper Loire Valley of France.

43:21.000 --> 43:21.958
[Mallory] Oh.

43:23.375 --> 43:25.083
[Michael] Very, very nice.

43:25.167 --> 43:26.208
Hmm.

43:36.500 --> 43:37.458
You're not having any?

43:37.542 --> 43:38.750
No, no, no.

43:38.833 --> 43:40.292
I prefer the red.

43:40.375 --> 43:41.333
Hmm.

43:41.417 --> 43:42.583
More for me then.

43:46.000 --> 43:47.292
To Gideon.

43:47.375 --> 43:48.583
To Gideon.

43:56.042 --> 43:57.583
[wine pours]

43:57.667 --> 43:59.250
[tense music]

44:05.042 --> 44:06.125
[thud]

44:10.958 --> 44:11.833
Mallory...

44:13.042 --> 44:17.083
I know you well enough to know
you never drink white wine.

44:18.250 --> 44:19.833
How much was in there?

44:19.875 --> 44:22.000
Enough to kill me
or just knock me out?

44:24.167 --> 44:26.625
Go back to work
before I seriously start

44:26.708 --> 44:28.708
considering repercussions.

44:45.833 --> 44:47.917
-[doors slams]
-[sniffles]

45:00.208 --> 45:01.333
[exhales]

45:16.042 --> 45:18.625
It was Vargas who pulled her
out of that orphanage,

45:18.708 --> 45:20.583
who had recognized her talents

45:20.667 --> 45:22.500
and who had honed her skills.

45:22.583 --> 45:25.167
And it was Vargas
who had betrayed her.

45:26.167 --> 45:27.833
In the end,
her training was more important

45:27.875 --> 45:29.500
than her relationships.

45:29.583 --> 45:31.500
If and when the time came,

45:31.583 --> 45:33.375
Gideon knew she would
have to kill him,

45:34.542 --> 45:35.833
and she also knew

45:36.750 --> 45:38.083
she wouldn't hesitate.

45:51.667 --> 45:52.917
I was wondering when
you're gonna come out.

46:01.208 --> 46:03.000
I don't know
why you're so angry.

46:03.083 --> 46:05.042
You're the one
who tried to poison me.

46:08.542 --> 46:09.792
[sighs]

46:16.833 --> 46:19.000
That writing cabinet
belonged to my grandfather.

46:20.708 --> 46:22.500
He was a writer.
Did I ever tell you that?

46:22.583 --> 46:24.667
Uh-uh.

46:24.750 --> 46:26.625
[Michael]
Dime store novels mostly.

46:26.708 --> 46:29.042
Never really had
any big successes.

46:29.125 --> 46:30.875
Neither did my father
for that matter.

46:32.500 --> 46:34.458
I just figured if...

46:34.542 --> 46:36.375
I didn't have any talent,

46:36.375 --> 46:39.042
why not do the deals
for the people who did?

46:43.083 --> 46:44.167
Wait.

46:55.167 --> 46:56.792
Why'd you really come out here?

46:58.750 --> 47:02.792
Well, actually,
I did have a request.

47:04.375 --> 47:06.583
-Go on.
-I need to do some research.

47:06.708 --> 47:08.792
-Your desk is in the library.
-You don't have what I need.

47:08.875 --> 47:10.750
-And what is that?
-The internet.

47:10.833 --> 47:13.000
[chuckles] I don't think so.

47:13.042 --> 47:14.875
-It's important.
-You'll just have to make do.

47:14.958 --> 47:16.417
[Mallory] It's just a browser.

47:16.500 --> 47:18.667
What am I supposed
to do with a browser?

47:18.708 --> 47:20.292
Oh, I don't know. Let's see.

47:20.375 --> 47:22.375
Maybe you send an email
from a website,

47:22.458 --> 47:25.208
post something in a chat room
or on a message board.

47:26.417 --> 47:27.458
Yeah, that's what I thought.

47:29.125 --> 47:31.458
This is the only
connection you have

47:31.542 --> 47:34.458
to the outside world,
and you are not getting it.

47:37.500 --> 47:39.417
Fine.

47:39.500 --> 47:41.083
I guess I'll just have to...

47:42.125 --> 47:43.375
make do.

47:43.500 --> 47:45.208
I guess so.

47:50.750 --> 47:51.958
[door squeaks, slams]

47:54.542 --> 47:56.375
[sighs]

48:07.208 --> 48:08.167
[phone chimes]

48:12.542 --> 48:14.083
[Michael] Attagirl, Wendy.

48:14.167 --> 48:17.042
Start stoking that interest.

48:19.458 --> 48:20.708
[news reporter]
Mallory's longtime publisher,

48:20.833 --> 48:22.167
Wendy Brouchard,

48:22.250 --> 48:23.833
hinted on an earnings
call this morning

48:23.958 --> 48:25.708
that prior to her recent death,

48:25.792 --> 48:27.833
hit mystery writer,
Mallory Dearborn,

48:27.917 --> 48:29.958
may actually have completed
one last title

48:30.042 --> 48:31.833
in her bestselling
Gideon Snow series.

48:31.917 --> 48:33.833
[chuckles]

48:33.917 --> 48:35.667
[news reporter]
According to her longtime agent,

48:35.708 --> 48:37.375
Michael Harrington,
there was indeed

48:37.458 --> 48:40.000
an unpublished Gideon Snow
manuscript discovered,

48:40.083 --> 48:42.000
along with other
partially completed works

48:42.125 --> 48:44.000
at Dearborn's residence.

48:44.083 --> 48:46.375
While no publication date
has been officially announced,

48:46.375 --> 48:49.167
Dearborn's fan base would
no doubt be excited to see

48:49.250 --> 48:52.542
the legendary detective
in action one last time.

49:02.625 --> 49:04.083
I'm most excited that,

49:04.167 --> 49:05.917
because the mystery
is so personal,

49:05.917 --> 49:07.875
this new novel
shows a side of Gideon

49:07.958 --> 49:09.750
that readers
have never seen before.

49:09.833 --> 49:11.458
And, so far,
the reaction from fans

49:11.542 --> 49:13.000
has been very positive,

49:13.083 --> 49:15.167
which frankly is all
I could ever hope for.

49:15.250 --> 49:16.500
[news anchor]
Speaking of the fans,

49:16.583 --> 49:18.292
is there any chance
you can give us a little hint

49:18.375 --> 49:19.958
of Gideon's next big mystery?

49:20.083 --> 49:21.167
[Mallory] I wish I could.

49:21.208 --> 49:22.917
The thing is I never write

49:23.042 --> 49:24.333
more than one book at a time.

49:24.458 --> 49:26.375
I never wanna give
my fans anything

49:26.375 --> 49:28.333
less than a hundred
percent of my effort.

49:28.417 --> 49:31.000
So I usually take
about a month off

49:31.042 --> 49:33.542
after publication
to gauge their reaction

49:33.625 --> 49:35.167
before I can even think about

49:35.208 --> 49:37.333
writing another book.

49:37.417 --> 49:39.083
[rewinds]

49:39.167 --> 49:41.292
So I usually take
about a month off

49:41.375 --> 49:43.917
after publication
to gauge their reaction

49:44.000 --> 49:45.417
before I can even think about

49:45.542 --> 49:46.750
writing another book.

49:46.833 --> 49:49.667
[suspenseful music]

50:02.375 --> 50:03.958
[sighs]

50:14.875 --> 50:16.042
Black?

50:16.125 --> 50:17.250
Obviously.

50:19.708 --> 50:22.208
With no extra ingredients?

50:22.292 --> 50:24.750
Just good
old-fashioned caffeine.

50:27.375 --> 50:28.667
[sighs]

50:30.833 --> 50:32.417
Thank you.

50:32.542 --> 50:33.667
Sit.

50:45.875 --> 50:47.167
[clears throat]

50:47.250 --> 50:49.167
Can I ask you a question?

50:49.208 --> 50:51.500
Guess you could call me
a captive audience.

50:54.042 --> 50:56.708
When you decided to stop
writing your Gideon books,

50:57.875 --> 51:00.167
did you ever consider how
it might affect other people?

51:00.250 --> 51:01.917
Of course, I did.

51:02.000 --> 51:03.167
[Michael] And?

51:03.292 --> 51:04.875
And I figured I could always

51:05.000 --> 51:06.333
just pay Gideon a visit

51:06.375 --> 51:07.833
somewhere down
the line, you know,

51:07.917 --> 51:09.167
when the timing was right

51:09.208 --> 51:11.000
and I hoped that my readers

51:11.125 --> 51:12.625
would be understanding

51:12.708 --> 51:15.333
of my desire
to try something different.

51:15.417 --> 51:17.375
I wasn't talking
about your readers.

51:18.708 --> 51:21.208
Tell me, if I hadn't found you

51:21.292 --> 51:23.500
in that mystery bookstore,
where would you be?

51:23.542 --> 51:26.125
I think we both benefited
over the years, don't you?

51:26.208 --> 51:28.375
And the years to come?
What about those?

51:30.208 --> 51:31.333
Where are you going?

51:32.667 --> 51:35.500
Do you want your book
before Christmas or not?

51:37.458 --> 51:39.375
[dramatic music]

51:43.625 --> 51:45.542
[phone rings]

51:46.875 --> 51:48.792
[phone vibrates]

51:51.375 --> 51:52.708
Wendy?

51:52.792 --> 51:54.250
I was just thinking about you.

51:54.375 --> 51:56.542
Yeah. Great, great,
great, great. Yeah.

51:56.625 --> 51:59.667
No, I'm really excited
about this manuscript.

51:59.792 --> 52:02.667
It has the potential
to be a real game changer.

52:04.500 --> 52:07.583
Tell them they have
nothing to worry about.

52:07.667 --> 52:08.833
You got my word.

52:10.417 --> 52:13.083
Trust me, it's gonna keep
readers guessing

52:13.167 --> 52:15.208
from start to finish.

52:16.250 --> 52:18.500
I know. I know. And you will.

52:18.542 --> 52:20.083
But you wouldn't wanna
open your present

52:20.167 --> 52:21.625
before Christmas morning,
would you?

52:22.875 --> 52:24.417
You won't regret this one.

52:24.500 --> 52:26.375
I'm confident this
book has all the elements

52:26.458 --> 52:29.208
to be Gideon's
bestselling novel yet.

52:30.375 --> 52:31.333
Okay.

52:31.417 --> 52:32.792
Bye.

52:39.833 --> 52:41.167
A little bit jumpy?

52:41.292 --> 52:42.750
I'm always
jumpy when I'm writing.

52:43.750 --> 52:45.708
You'll never guess
who just called me.

52:47.208 --> 52:49.708
-[Mallory] Who?
-Wendy Brouchard.

52:49.792 --> 52:52.000
Seems everyone at the company
is thrilled about the new book.

52:52.042 --> 52:53.500
[Mallory]
It's great news, right?

52:53.583 --> 52:55.750
The sooner this is over,
the sooner we can...

52:57.042 --> 52:59.542
go back to our lives, right?

53:00.708 --> 53:01.958
Yeah.

53:02.042 --> 53:03.500
Of course. Of course.

53:03.542 --> 53:04.750
Something wrong?

53:05.708 --> 53:08.417
Now, I know this
hasn't been easy for you.

53:08.500 --> 53:09.875
To tell you the truth,
it hasn't exactly been

53:10.000 --> 53:11.333
a picnic for me either.

53:11.375 --> 53:12.917
If you're looking
for sympathy from me--

53:13.000 --> 53:15.333
No. [laughs]
I know better than that.

53:16.542 --> 53:19.208
But I am gonna have to go back
into the city tomorrow

53:19.292 --> 53:20.875
to meet with Wendy
about the new book,

53:20.875 --> 53:22.167
which means unfortunately--

53:22.250 --> 53:23.625
You're gonna have to lock me up.

53:23.708 --> 53:25.167
Just for a few hours.

53:25.292 --> 53:26.792
Unless you have
a better suggestion.

53:26.875 --> 53:28.833
I can promise you I won't leave.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.792
[laugh]

53:32.000 --> 53:33.583
That's funny.

53:33.667 --> 53:35.792
At least, you haven't lost
your sense of humor.

53:35.917 --> 53:40.083
Oh, is there, uh, anything
I can bring back for you?

53:40.167 --> 53:42.167
I'd settle
for your head on a spike.

53:42.250 --> 53:43.833
Yeah.

53:43.917 --> 53:45.375
You know, I was thinking,

53:45.458 --> 53:47.667
there's no reason
this has to be a one-off.

53:48.708 --> 53:53.042
Maybe there's another
Gideon novel in there somewhere.

53:53.167 --> 53:54.083
Don't push it.

53:54.167 --> 53:55.375
Hmm.

53:55.458 --> 53:57.542
We can think about it.

53:57.625 --> 53:58.875

[Carrie] Hi. Uh, my name
is Carrie Addison.

54:18.583 --> 54:20.208
I'm the host of a--of a podcast

54:20.333 --> 54:22.417
about, um, mystery writers.

54:22.542 --> 54:25.250
I'm writing a piece about
the life of Mallory Dearborn,

54:25.333 --> 54:26.958
and she mentioned
in an interview

54:27.042 --> 54:28.375
that you two were close.

54:28.500 --> 54:29.958
After the news of her death,

54:30.042 --> 54:31.333
you wrote on your socials

54:31.417 --> 54:33.208

Did she ever mention
writing books

54:49.375 --> 54:51.583
that maybe
hadn't been published?

how Mallory died?

that's what buzz does.

certainly was special.

about her death, Michael.

55:29.542 --> 55:32.500
But from a business perspective,

55:32.542 --> 55:35.375

is a literary grand slam.

Yeah. Uh, when I was going
through her files.

a bit of material in there.

55:52.208 --> 55:53.583
Most of it unfinished,
of course.

55:53.708 --> 55:56.083
That's a little surprising, no?

55:56.167 --> 55:57.417
Why?

55:57.542 --> 55:58.708
Because she never
mentioned it to you.

not her priest.

of aspects of her life

56:02.208 --> 56:03.917

56:05.542 --> 56:07.458
[Michael] Positive.

56:07.542 --> 56:09.333

no one can write like her.

56:09.417 --> 56:11.042
[Wendy] Okay. Well,

[exhales] That's a week away.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.667

a problem, considering

56:19.750 --> 56:21.708

the book in hand.

56:23.167 --> 56:25.042
Of course.

01:08:33.667 --> 01:08:35.292
One more day,
you'll have your book.

01:08:37.208 --> 01:08:39.125
It was never my book, Mal.

01:08:40.125 --> 01:08:42.208
I just provided the inspiration.

01:08:42.292 --> 01:08:43.500
-Right.
-[car approaching]

01:08:45.667 --> 01:08:47.042
[car horn honks]

01:08:47.125 --> 01:08:48.625
Expecting someone?

01:08:50.125 --> 01:08:51.250
No.

01:08:53.625 --> 01:08:54.500
Hi.

01:08:55.875 --> 01:08:57.833
Hi there.

01:08:57.917 --> 01:08:59.583
Uh, Michael was it?

01:08:59.667 --> 01:09:01.667
That's right.
Good morning, sheriff.

01:09:01.750 --> 01:09:03.958
Still have your business card
right here.

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:06.083
[chuckles]

01:09:06.167 --> 01:09:08.458
I just thought I'd, uh,

01:09:08.542 --> 01:09:11.125
come out and take
another look around,

01:09:11.208 --> 01:09:12.375
if that's okay with you.

01:09:12.458 --> 01:09:14.292
Yeah. I'm glad you did.

01:09:14.375 --> 01:09:16.333
Is there anything
I can help you find?

01:09:16.417 --> 01:09:18.208
Uh, we'll see what we find.

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:20.333
Well, I don't know
what you're hoping to find.

01:09:20.417 --> 01:09:23.667
It's been too darn cold out here
to do much of anything lately.

01:09:23.792 --> 01:09:24.833
[chuckles]

01:09:28.708 --> 01:09:31.208
[Sheriff Hill]
Been doing some digging, huh?

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:34.458
[Michael] What?
You mean my compost pit?

01:09:34.542 --> 01:09:37.750
It's probably been
like a couple weeks, at least.

01:09:39.208 --> 01:09:40.625
What's this?

01:09:44.833 --> 01:09:46.500
I was looking for that.

01:09:46.625 --> 01:09:48.792
It must have fallen off
when I was digging.

01:09:57.292 --> 01:09:58.667
Doesn't fit, huh?

01:10:00.792 --> 01:10:01.958
Must be the cold.

01:10:02.042 --> 01:10:03.208
Yeah.

01:10:04.333 --> 01:10:08.667
Speaking of, uh,
mind if we go inside?

01:10:14.708 --> 01:10:19.667
Just isn't Christmas
without a tree, huh?

01:10:19.750 --> 01:10:22.333
A lot of folks
complain about the cold,

01:10:22.417 --> 01:10:26.000
but me, I love
the holiday season up here.

01:10:26.042 --> 01:10:27.333
Yeah. Me too.

01:10:28.500 --> 01:10:31.333
Anyways, uh, we got a call

01:10:31.417 --> 01:10:34.042
about a person that had gone
missing around these parts,

01:10:34.125 --> 01:10:36.708
and that made me think
about that, uh,

01:10:36.792 --> 01:10:39.792
911 call from before.

01:10:39.875 --> 01:10:41.292
Oh?

01:10:41.375 --> 01:10:45.958
A fella named Grant Hudson
from Jersey.

01:10:46.042 --> 01:10:50.542
Sister said he came out to stay
at B and B down the road.

01:10:50.625 --> 01:10:53.375
She hadn't heard from him
in a couple of weeks.

01:10:53.458 --> 01:10:56.458
-Really? Hmm.
-Yeah. I was asking around,

01:10:56.542 --> 01:11:01.375
but it seems
you're the only one home.

01:11:01.458 --> 01:11:05.000
Well, my neighbors are a bunch
of snowbirds, I'm afraid.

01:11:05.083 --> 01:11:06.500
Hmm.

01:11:06.583 --> 01:11:08.333
Well, you wouldn't have happened

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:11.500
to have seen anyone, have you?

01:11:11.583 --> 01:11:13.917
No. Not since
you were here last.

01:11:15.458 --> 01:11:16.917
That's what I figured...

01:11:18.208 --> 01:11:19.917
or else she would have called.

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:23.458
Huh.

01:11:27.542 --> 01:11:29.000
[sighs]

01:11:33.167 --> 01:11:34.292
One of your authors?

01:11:34.375 --> 01:11:35.667
One of my best.

01:11:37.375 --> 01:11:39.000
I'll have to pick up
one of her books

01:11:39.125 --> 01:11:40.625
when I have the time.

01:11:40.708 --> 01:11:42.542
I'll tell you what, Sheriff,
why don't you take that one?

01:11:42.625 --> 01:11:44.792
-Oh, no, no.
-No. Come on. I insist.

01:11:44.875 --> 01:11:47.792
-It's an early Christmas gift.
-Thank you.

01:11:47.875 --> 01:11:49.750
Yeah, in fact, she's working
on a new one right now.

01:11:49.875 --> 01:11:50.833
Ah.

01:11:51.875 --> 01:11:55.792
Well, uh, I hate to say it
but I gotta get back to work.

01:11:57.875 --> 01:12:01.500
Well, I thought
you came up here to relax.

01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:04.167
Well, you know what they say,
no rest for the weary--

01:12:04.250 --> 01:12:05.917
-Huh.
---or their agents.

01:12:12.458 --> 01:12:14.667
Sorry you wasted your time
coming all the way out here,

01:12:14.708 --> 01:12:17.500
but if I hear anything
about the hiker,

01:12:17.542 --> 01:12:20.542
that is, I'll be sure
to give you a call.

01:12:20.542 --> 01:12:22.583
I'd sure appreciate that.

01:12:22.667 --> 01:12:24.417
Thank you for your time.

01:12:30.917 --> 01:12:32.833
[car engine revs]

01:12:38.708 --> 01:12:41.958
[Mallory] And with that,
she turned and walked away.

01:12:43.458 --> 01:12:45.833
She didn't know
what the future would bring.

01:12:45.958 --> 01:12:48.875
She didn't know what mysteries,
if any at all, lay ahead.

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.958
The only thing she did know
is that she was ready to face

01:12:52.042 --> 01:12:55.833
this uncertain future
like she always did,

01:12:55.917 --> 01:12:57.750
one day at a time.

01:13:04.208 --> 01:13:05.500
The end.

01:13:08.083 --> 01:13:09.042
[sighs]

01:13:24.042 --> 01:13:24.917
Well?

01:13:26.708 --> 01:13:27.625
Your book.

01:13:29.542 --> 01:13:31.875
That's it? The book is finished?

01:13:31.958 --> 01:13:35.333
The whole 75,000 words,
give or take.

01:13:35.458 --> 01:13:36.792
We did it.

01:13:36.875 --> 01:13:37.792
You did it, Mal.

01:13:38.958 --> 01:13:40.833
It's cause for a drink,
don't you think?

01:13:40.917 --> 01:13:42.208
Hmm?

01:13:42.292 --> 01:13:43.917
[Mallory chuckles]

01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:45.333
Aged 15 years.

01:13:45.375 --> 01:13:46.667
I brought this back
from Scotland myself.

01:13:48.042 --> 01:13:50.125
You can't drink scotch.

01:13:50.208 --> 01:13:51.833
No?

01:13:51.875 --> 01:13:54.625
No. When I finish a book,
we'd always...

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:58.125
-Champagne.
-Exactly.

01:13:58.208 --> 01:13:59.833
-Yeah.
-[chuckling]

01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:04.083

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:07.833
Oops.

01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:18.083
To Gideon's gone

01:14:19.458 --> 01:14:21.917
but maybe not for good, hmm?

01:14:23.042 --> 01:14:24.167
Bottoms up.

01:14:28.542 --> 01:14:30.458
-Mmm.
-Mmm.

01:14:30.542 --> 01:14:33.167
-[coughs]
-[chuckles]

01:14:33.292 --> 01:14:36.333
Why don't you pour us another

01:14:36.458 --> 01:14:38.042
and I'll read you the ending?

01:14:38.167 --> 01:14:39.583
Sounds good.

01:14:47.042 --> 01:14:48.708
Goodnight, Janice.

01:14:48.833 --> 01:14:50.125
[exhales]

01:14:52.208 --> 01:14:53.125
[chuckles]

01:14:54.917 --> 01:14:56.125
-Janice.
-Oh.

01:14:57.333 --> 01:14:59.250
-Sorry, Sheriff.
-I said goodnight.

01:14:59.375 --> 01:15:00.875
I'm, uh, I'm headed home.

01:15:00.958 --> 01:15:03.583
This thing has got me hooked.

01:15:03.708 --> 01:15:04.875
What you got there?

01:15:06.208 --> 01:15:07.708
Mystery novel.

01:15:07.792 --> 01:15:09.750
This author can write.

01:15:09.833 --> 01:15:11.083
[Sheriff Hill chuckles]

01:15:11.208 --> 01:15:12.500
That's funny.

01:15:12.542 --> 01:15:14.333
I got this book yesterday.

01:15:14.417 --> 01:15:15.958
-You bought a book?
-No.

01:15:16.042 --> 01:15:18.708
-[chuckles]
-Uh, the agent gave it to me.

01:15:18.875 --> 01:15:21.292
-What do you mean?
-Oh, he's got that, uh,

01:15:21.375 --> 01:15:23.667
big Tudor place
off Winslow Street.

01:15:23.750 --> 01:15:26.333
-Huh.
-Who knows, you know?

01:15:26.417 --> 01:15:29.292
Maybe we'll get to meet her
one day too.

01:15:29.375 --> 01:15:31.292
[chuckles]

01:15:31.375 --> 01:15:33.042
Not unless you hold a seance.

01:15:33.125 --> 01:15:35.625
[chuckles]

01:15:35.708 --> 01:15:37.500
Uh, what are you talking about?

01:15:37.625 --> 01:15:39.208
-The author?
-Yeah.

01:15:39.292 --> 01:15:40.958
-Mallory Dearborn...
-Uh-huh.

01:15:41.042 --> 01:15:41.917
She's dead.

01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:46.083
-Recently?
-Very recently.

01:15:46.167 --> 01:15:48.208
Gosh, Sheriff,
don't you read the news?

01:15:49.792 --> 01:15:51.292
I could have sworn he said--

01:15:51.375 --> 01:15:53.083
Said what?

01:15:54.625 --> 01:15:56.708
Nothing. I...

01:15:56.792 --> 01:16:00.667
I guess I must have just,
uh, misheard him.

01:16:08.542 --> 01:16:09.833
[groans]

01:16:09.875 --> 01:16:11.417
-I got woozy for a sec.
-[Mallory] Uh-hmm.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:12.833
Didn't you know
that's what happens

01:16:12.875 --> 01:16:14.625
when you mix scotch
and champagne?

01:16:14.708 --> 01:16:16.833
-Oh.
-[Mallory] But don't you worry.

01:16:16.875 --> 01:16:19.167
-Hmm.
-All you have to do

01:16:19.292 --> 01:16:21.167
is sit there and listen.

01:16:22.375 --> 01:16:23.333
Okay.

01:16:29.208 --> 01:16:30.125
Hmm.

01:16:32.750 --> 01:16:37.250
"And in that moment, Gideon knew
that she was finally free.

01:16:39.375 --> 01:16:41.500
Not just from Vargas,

01:16:41.583 --> 01:16:43.958
but from her own prison
of self-doubt.

01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.667
She was a detective at her core.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:52.250
And although he may have been
the first to notice it,

01:16:52.333 --> 01:16:54.000
to nurture it,

01:16:54.083 --> 01:16:57.875
it was as indelible
a part of her as her eyes

01:16:57.958 --> 01:17:01.333
were the angry-looking scar
across her eyebrow."

01:17:01.458 --> 01:17:03.208
Hmm. I'm loving it, Mal.

01:17:03.333 --> 01:17:04.875
Keep going. Keep going.

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.625
"Vargas had done her
two big favors.

01:17:08.792 --> 01:17:14.375
One, he had reinvigorated
her love for the craft,

01:17:15.875 --> 01:17:20.500
but, more importantly,
he had broken his vow

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:24.375
to never let her
get behind him again."

01:17:31.417 --> 01:17:33.042
Get up.

01:17:33.167 --> 01:17:34.333
Get up, you bastard.

01:17:34.375 --> 01:17:36.000
-You hit me?
-Yes.

01:17:36.042 --> 01:17:38.167
And if you don't get up
right now, I'll kill you.

-I'm up.
-[Mallory] Good.

01:18:02.583 --> 01:18:04.333
Gotta be honest with you, Mal.

01:18:04.917 --> 01:18:06.667
I'm not too crazy
about this ending.

01:18:06.708 --> 01:18:09.000
-Shut up.

01:18:12.375 --> 01:18:13.333
Unlock it.

01:18:15.083 --> 01:18:16.167
Do it.

01:18:27.792 --> 01:18:30.583
All I ever wanted
was to help you, Mallory.

01:18:30.667 --> 01:18:32.667
After all,
where would you be without me?

01:18:32.750 --> 01:18:34.917
-Out of this house.
-Hmm.

01:18:37.125 --> 01:18:39.375
Now, like I told you
a long time ago...

01:18:44.667 --> 01:18:48.417
Nobody's leaving here.

01:18:48.500 --> 01:18:50.250
You had me fooled, Mal.

01:18:50.375 --> 01:18:51.375
I'll give you that.

01:18:52.625 --> 01:18:55.333
I thought we were
on the same page, hmm?

01:18:55.417 --> 01:18:57.083
But now that you're finished,

01:18:57.083 --> 01:18:59.417
I think it's time
we close this book for good.

throw me off, Mal?

in the dark by now.

make it worse for yourself.

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.417
Please, send help.
Someone is trying to kill me.

01:20:06.417 --> 01:20:08.375
[dispatcher] Ma'am, did you say
someone is trying to kill you?

01:20:08.458 --> 01:20:10.542
-Yes. Please send help.
-[dispatcher] Where are you?

01:20:10.625 --> 01:20:12.875
-[Michael] Mallory.
-[Mallory] Oh, the address?

01:20:12.958 --> 01:20:13.958
I don't remember.

01:20:14.042 --> 01:20:16.167
Um, uh, Winslow Street,

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:18.167
um, but it's owned
by Michael Harrington.

01:20:18.208 --> 01:20:19.458
[dispatcher] Is he the one
trying to hurt you, ma'am?

01:20:19.542 --> 01:20:21.125
Yes. Please send help.

01:20:22.875 --> 01:20:24.667
Where did he go?

01:20:24.750 --> 01:20:26.250
Forget about the sword
and pen, Mal.

01:20:26.333 --> 01:20:28.917
A laptop to the head has got
them both beat.

01:20:30.042 --> 01:20:31.833
-Get off of me!
-[both grunting]

01:20:31.917 --> 01:20:35.500
[suspense music]

01:20:39.542 --> 01:20:41.958
[dispatcher] Ma'am? Ma'am?
Are you still there?

01:20:45.375 --> 01:20:48.083
[Michael] I really wanna
collaborate on another book now,

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:50.958
but now it's time for you to
join that hiker six feet under.

01:20:56.042 --> 01:20:57.750
-Leave her alone.
-Who are you?

01:20:57.833 --> 01:20:59.792
[grunts]

01:20:59.875 --> 01:21:01.167
[gunshot]

01:21:01.250 --> 01:21:02.583
[grunts]

01:21:03.875 --> 01:21:05.625
-[gunshot]
-[gasps]

01:21:05.708 --> 01:21:07.125
[shrieks]

01:21:08.292 --> 01:21:09.500
[groans]

01:21:18.667 --> 01:21:20.000
So this is how the novel ends?

01:21:21.083 --> 01:21:22.875
Only one problem.

01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:26.708
I'm not Vargas
and you're not Gideon.

01:21:26.833 --> 01:21:29.167
You're right, I'm not Gideon.

01:21:29.208 --> 01:21:32.083
My name is Mallory Dearborn.

01:21:34.417 --> 01:21:35.542
Police!

01:21:37.833 --> 01:21:43.083
Sheriff, this man has kept me
prisoner for over a month.

01:21:43.083 --> 01:21:44.958
He killed your hiker.

01:21:45.042 --> 01:21:47.000
You'll find him
buried in the woods.

01:21:51.875 --> 01:21:53.458
All right. Come on.

01:21:53.542 --> 01:21:55.375
As soon as you two ladies
are up for it,

01:21:55.458 --> 01:21:57.292
please come down
to see me at the station

01:21:57.375 --> 01:21:59.583
so I can get a statement
from both of you.

01:22:06.708 --> 01:22:08.875
I remember you.

01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:10.542
Carrie, right,
from the bookstore?

01:22:11.833 --> 01:22:14.083
I told you I'm your biggest fan.

01:22:14.167 --> 01:22:17.292
Actually, Carrie,
I think I'm yours.

01:22:17.375 --> 01:22:19.000
[chuckles]

01:22:19.083 --> 01:22:20.917
How did you find me?

01:22:22.917 --> 01:22:24.333
Well, I had a little help

01:22:25.417 --> 01:22:27.167
from the best detective
in the world.

01:22:27.250 --> 01:22:28.750
I don't know
if you've heard of her.

01:22:28.833 --> 01:22:29.833
Gideon Snow.

01:22:29.958 --> 01:22:32.542
[laughter]

01:22:39.375 --> 01:22:40.500
[exhales]

01:22:44.750 --> 01:22:47.625
[siren wailing on a distance]

01:22:56.292 --> 01:22:57.917
Thank you so much.
Enjoy the book.

01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.250
[woman] Thank you.

01:23:00.875 --> 01:23:03.125
In case I forget,

01:23:03.208 --> 01:23:05.417
thank you again
for this opportunity.

01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:06.875
No, thank you.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.833
Besides, it's the least
I could do,

01:23:08.958 --> 01:23:10.667
given that I have no bigger fan.

01:23:10.750 --> 01:23:12.250
[chuckles]

01:23:13.583 --> 01:23:15.000
For once, I wrote a book

01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:16.583
that actually means something
and I...

01:23:17.583 --> 01:23:20.333
I couldn't have done it alone,
so...

01:23:24.042 --> 01:23:27.458
So what are you gonna do next?

01:23:27.542 --> 01:23:29.167
Something historical.

01:23:29.208 --> 01:23:30.708
Something that probably
won't make any money.

01:23:30.792 --> 01:23:31.833
[chuckles]

01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:33.417
What about you?

01:23:33.542 --> 01:23:34.708
I don't know. I'm...

01:23:34.792 --> 01:23:36.667
I was thinking about asking

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:40.458
if the world might be ready
for another Gideon Snow book?

01:23:40.542 --> 01:23:41.917
Are you volunteering?

01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.417
Only with your permission,
of course.

01:23:47.458 --> 01:23:51.667
I can't think of anyone better
than the Mystery Maven herself.

01:23:52.875 --> 01:23:54.333
-Really?
-Yeah.

01:23:54.417 --> 01:23:57.792
Just, uh, take good care
of her for me, will you?

01:23:57.875 --> 01:23:58.750
I will.

01:24:00.667 --> 01:24:01.750
Oh. [chuckles]

01:24:03.208 --> 01:24:04.750
Well, I'll save you
the first signed copy.

01:24:04.833 --> 01:24:06.917
-I'll hold you to that.
-Okay.

01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:09.125
[chuckles]

01:24:09.208 --> 01:24:10.792
Oh, my gosh.

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:12.333
Woo!

01:24:12.417 --> 01:24:14.292
[chuckles]

01:24:17.708 --> 01:24:20.667
[soft dramatic music]
