00:09.885 --> 00:13.765
Come on. Come on. Should be
just enough to finish the job.

00:13.972 --> 00:16.646
Phew! Can't be too careful
with this stuff.

00:18.519 --> 00:20.066
(alarm sounding )

00:25.025 --> 00:25.742
( clock beeping )
"Warning."

00:25.943 --> 00:27.616
Blah blah blah...

00:27.819 --> 00:30.242
"Extreme usage could result
in minor gravity anomalies."

00:30.447 --> 00:32.448
Can it, Poindexter.
I've come this far.

00:32.658 --> 00:34.410
I'm not giving up now.

00:34.618 --> 00:35.870
( Blares )

00:38.997 --> 00:42.046
Yes, this is it!

00:44.795 --> 00:45.762
( Bleats )

01:02.271 --> 01:05.366
STAN: It's gonna be a bumpy ride,
but it'll all be worth it.

01:11.363 --> 01:13.036
Just eighteen more hours.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.868
Finally, everything changes...

01:16.076 --> 01:17.123
today.

01:35.012 --> 01:36.889
MABEL: Aah! It's here!
It's here! It's here!

01:37.097 --> 01:38.849
( Yawns )

01:39.057 --> 01:41.856
Okay, so I was just opening
random doors, because I'm a creep,

01:42.060 --> 01:44.483
when I found
something amazing!

01:44.688 --> 01:47.817
If it was worth waking up at
7:00 am for, that will be amazing.

01:48.025 --> 01:49.823
Feast your eyes!

01:50.027 --> 01:51.495
DIPPER: Whoa!

01:51.695 --> 01:53.868
Bro. Bro.
We're both thinkin' it.

01:54.072 --> 01:56.291
BOTH: Crazy rooftop
fireworks party!

01:56.491 --> 01:58.619
Not so fast, kids.

01:58.827 --> 02:03.207
There is no way on earth you're setting
off those dangerous, illegal fireworks...

02:03.415 --> 02:04.337
without me.

02:07.502 --> 02:08.970
(all laughing)

02:09.170 --> 02:10.592
Here you go, sweetie!

02:10.797 --> 02:13.425
Set something on fire for your
Grunkle Stan!

02:13.634 --> 02:15.932
I am the god
of destruction!

02:17.179 --> 02:19.932
ALL: ( laughing )
Whoa!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.518
<i>Ya“ Whoa'.!</i>

02:22.726 --> 02:24.399
Hold on a minute.
Do you have a permit for those?

02:24.561 --> 02:25.904
Uh...

02:26.104 --> 02:28.106
Uh, do you have a permit
for being totally lame?

02:28.315 --> 02:30.409
(all laughing)
Hey-o!

02:30.609 --> 02:33.408
( Chuckles )
Well, I can't argue with that.

02:33.612 --> 02:34.784
Carry on.

02:34.988 --> 02:36.786
Ha ha!
( sighs )

02:36.990 --> 02:39.118
But seriously, though, we should
probably clean this mess up.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.747
With water balloons?

02:43.955 --> 02:44.877
I don't see why not.

02:47.959 --> 02:48.881
Seriously?

02:49.086 --> 02:50.178
,,°,..".Z,'b!

02:50.379 --> 02:52.757
Ah, this is what
Saturdays are for.

02:52.923 --> 02:54.345
Doing dumb things forever!

02:54.549 --> 02:56.347
BOTH:
Dumb things forever!

02:56.551 --> 02:58.679
( laughing )
Whoa, there!

02:58.887 --> 02:59.683
To Grunkle Stan!

02:59.888 --> 03:02.266
Not just a great uncle--

03:02.474 --> 03:03.976
The greatest uncle!

03:04.184 --> 03:07.188
Ha ha. All right,
all right. I tell ya,

03:07.396 --> 03:10.775
it's unnatural for siblings to
get along as well as you do.

03:10.982 --> 03:13.405
Ha ha! Don't worry, we've still
got plenty of summer left

03:13.610 --> 03:14.907
to drive each other crazy.

03:15.112 --> 03:20.869
Heh...yeah...
plenty of summer left.

03:21.076 --> 03:24.171
Kids, there's something I, uh...
something I should tell you.

03:24.371 --> 03:27.375
It's, um... W-well, it's
complicated.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.175
I...

03:29.376 --> 03:31.845
I'm gonna go refresh my soda.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.513
Enjoy it while you can, Stan.

03:33.714 --> 03:35.512
They'll find out
sooner or later.

03:36.675 --> 03:38.677
Today's the day.

03:38.885 --> 03:39.977
What is that, a ladybug?

03:40.178 --> 03:41.896
( Grunting )

03:42.097 --> 03:43.474
What the--
Oh, no!

03:43.640 --> 03:44.562
(grunts)

03:45.976 --> 03:47.899
Target's secure.
Take the house.

03:49.521 --> 03:50.397
( Helicopters whirring )
What the...?

03:50.605 --> 03:51.447
Kids are secure.

03:51.648 --> 03:53.195
Roof team, go!

03:57.028 --> 03:58.871
Clear!

03:59.072 --> 04:00.574
Clear!

04:00.782 --> 04:01.783
( Squeals )

04:01.992 --> 04:04.165
Pig secure--we
have secured a pig.

04:06.496 --> 04:07.998
STAN:
( groaning )

04:08.165 --> 04:10.133
Hey, hands off, you stooge!

04:10.333 --> 04:11.880
Aah! I don't understand!

04:12.043 --> 04:15.297
What did I do that warrants
this much arresting?

04:16.923 --> 04:18.345
The government guys?

04:18.550 --> 04:20.392
I thought you
got eaten by zombies.

04:20.594 --> 04:22.141
We survived...barely.

04:22.345 --> 04:24.188
I used Trigger
as a human shield.

04:24.389 --> 04:25.857
He cried like a baby.

04:26.057 --> 04:26.853
Wha--hey!

04:27.058 --> 04:28.651
Not in front
of the special ops guys.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.856
This is security footage
of a government waste facility.

04:32.063 --> 04:36.284
At 0400 hours last night, someone robbed
300 gallons of dangerous waste.

04:36.443 --> 04:37.911
What? You think
that's me?

04:38.111 --> 04:39.784
Don't play dumb
with us, Pines!

04:39.988 --> 04:42.491
But I actually am dumb!
Last night I was restocking

04:42.699 --> 04:43.791
the gift shop...I swear!

04:43.992 --> 04:46.290
Wait, Grunkle Stan!

04:46.495 --> 04:48.964
You've got the wrong guy!
Our Grunkle Stan might shoplift

04:49.164 --> 04:52.885
the occasional tangerine,
but he's notsome evil supervillain.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.837
Listen, kid. We've been watching
your family all summer,

04:56.046 --> 04:57.719
and we've seen
some disturbing things,

04:57.881 --> 05:00.725
but nothing as dangerous
as what your uncle is hiding.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.888
Somewhere hidden in this
shack is a doomsday device!

05:05.889 --> 05:07.391
Trigger, you take
the children.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.352
I'll talk to the old man.
Sorry to break it to you, kids,

05:10.519 --> 05:12.692
but you don't know
your uncle at all.

05:14.231 --> 05:16.700
Icee pop, clear!
Hey!

05:23.907 --> 05:27.878
Kids! You gotta believe me!
For once I'm actually innocent!

Break down the door!

05:38.380 --> 05:40.098
Or...maybe not.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.733
Stanford Pines, you stand accused
of theft of government waste,

05:53.937 --> 05:56.565
conspiracy, and possession
of illegal weapons.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.366
How do you plead
to these charges?

I mean, "innoguilty."

06:01.903 --> 06:04.201
Um...can I
have my phone call?

06:06.491 --> 06:08.960

got that comes with a free toy.

of possession situation?

06:14.040 --> 06:14.757
<i>Soos, pick up!</i>

06:14.958 --> 06:16.084
Mr. Pines,
what happened?

06:16.293 --> 06:17.636
I heard you got arrested
or something?

06:17.836 --> 06:18.837
I had to go get
some panic food.

06:19.045 --> 06:20.672
<i>Listen, I need
something from you.</i>

06:20.839 --> 06:22.557

06:37.689 --> 06:39.362

<i>We've got Mr. Pines
in custody.</i>

06:51.244 --> 06:52.962

<i>You take care
of those kids.</i>

What are you gonna do to us?

06:57.292 --> 07:00.091
- We'll be taking you to child services.
- Boo!

07:00.295 --> 07:02.798
In the meantime, enjoy
some mindless reality TV...

07:02.964 --> 07:05.717

you stop asking questions.

There's no way Stan was
stealing hazardous waste.

07:17.395 --> 07:18.612
We gotta clear his name!

07:18.813 --> 07:19.735
Hmm...

07:21.942 --> 07:24.365
Wait a minute,
the security tapes!

07:24.569 --> 07:27.197
Didn't Stan say he was restocking
the gift shop last night?

07:27.364 --> 07:29.037
If we could get the Mystery Shack's
surveillance tapes,

07:29.199 --> 07:30.621
we could prove
he's innocent!

07:30.825 --> 07:33.920
We just need to think
of a way out of here.

07:34.079 --> 07:36.457

Come on, Dipper. We're gonna go
clear our uncle's name.

08:15.787 --> 08:18.666
Oh, you poor kids. You really think
your uncle's innocent?

08:18.873 --> 08:21.797
I've seen it all before.
False names, double lives.

08:21.960 --> 08:23.507
One minute, they're playing
with water balloons.

08:23.712 --> 08:25.680
The next, they're building
doomsday devices.

08:25.839 --> 08:27.841
Your uncle scammed
the whole world.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.301
You gonna let him
scam you, too?

You--you don't know
what you're talking about.

I gotta be there!
Come on, Stan,

08:53.908 --> 08:54.875
you gotta think
of a way out of this.

you karate-chop the other dude
in the neck,

and then we'll back-flip
through the front door!

the simpler solution?

09:52.175 --> 09:53.097
On, right.

09:53.301 --> 09:55.144
So is it a rock,
or is it a face?

09:55.345 --> 09:57.814

it's a metaphor.

10:11.820 --> 10:13.117
All right.
If I was Stan,

10:13.279 --> 10:16.032
where would I hide
those surveillance tapes?

"jackalope"?

Okay, okay. So maybe Grunkle Stan
stole some toxic waste.

11:27.187 --> 11:29.986
That doesn't mean he's leading
a nefarious double life.

in Pines' death."

12:05.058 --> 12:08.779
"Fiery car crash,
brakes cut..." By who?

12:11.022 --> 12:13.741
DIPPER: "Unnamed grifter
at large"?

12:13.942 --> 12:15.694
Why would they call him
"unnamed"?

12:15.902 --> 12:17.745
Unless Stan...

12:17.946 --> 12:18.742
...isn't...

12:18.947 --> 12:20.790
"Stan?!
Stan?!

12:27.914 --> 12:29.461
DIPPER: Stan Pines is dead?

12:29.666 --> 12:31.339
Then who have we
been living with?

12:31.542 --> 12:32.714
It doesn't make
any sense!

12:32.919 --> 12:35.047
There has to be
some explanation.

12:35.255 --> 12:36.848
Maybe we're getting
Ker-Pranked!

12:37.048 --> 12:38.800
Justin Ker-Prank
is gonna jump up

12:39.008 --> 12:41.932
from behind one of these plants,
any minute now!

12:43.304 --> 12:45.602
Any minute, Justin.

12:45.807 --> 12:47.935
Can't believe it! This whole summer
I've beenlooking for answers,

12:48.142 --> 12:50.816
and the biggest mystery
was right under our nose.

12:51.020 --> 12:53.694
There's gotta be some kind
of explanation in here, somewhere.

12:53.898 --> 12:54.694
What the--?

12:54.899 --> 12:57.322
"Secret Code to Hideout"?

12:57.485 --> 12:59.237
Let me see that!

12:59.404 --> 13:01.782
A1, B, C3...

13:01.990 --> 13:03.833
I've never seen
a code like this.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.159
Wait, I have!

13:05.368 --> 13:07.621
Dipper,
it's the vending machine!

13:12.333 --> 13:14.552
All right, Pines.
Play time is over.

13:14.752 --> 13:16.880
Chopper's ready
to dust off to Washington.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.806
I'll enjoy
putting you away.

13:19.007 --> 13:21.556
What? Um, can't we stick
around for maybe one minute,

13:21.759 --> 13:23.727
uh, one minute,
thirty seconds?

13:23.928 --> 13:26.727
We're not falling
for your games, Pines.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.558
You've been running
your whole life.

13:28.725 --> 13:31.228
Your time is finally up.

13:31.436 --> 13:33.734
Bathroom break?
Just gimme 15 seconds.

13:33.938 --> 13:35.861
Sorry, but you've got
a flight to catch.

13:41.529 --> 13:42.781
Oh, yeah?
So do you!

13:42.989 --> 13:44.286
Huh?

13:44.490 --> 13:46.709

13:49.954 --> 13:51.501
POWERS: Whoa, whoa, hey!

13:51.706 --> 13:53.333

Dang it, get back here!

14:00.923 --> 14:02.391
POWERS: Men, get him!

14:05.345 --> 14:08.599
POWERS: No! You won't get
away with this! Aah!

14:11.059 --> 14:13.187
_GOI1I1a get _Aah! Va!

14:13.394 --> 14:15.396
POWERS: Ow!
( coffee mug breaks )

14:15.563 --> 14:17.691
Whoa!

14:17.899 --> 14:18.775
You know where
the Mystery Shack is?

14:18.983 --> 14:19.905
Uh, yeah.

14:20.109 --> 14:21.201
Okay,
here's a hundred bucks.

14:21.361 --> 14:22.908
Drive as far away
from the Shack as possible,

14:23.112 --> 14:25.581
and don't stop when the cops
start chasing you!

14:29.327 --> 14:31.204
POWERS: He's getting away!

14:31.412 --> 14:34.086
Obviously,
follow that cab!

14:36.376 --> 14:38.470
Stanford escaped!
He's at large!

14:38.669 --> 14:41.593
We need to sweep the town!
Move, move, move!

14:54.811 --> 14:56.108
All right, Soos,
remember the plan.

14:56.312 --> 14:57.814
Protect the machine,
earn Stan's trust,

14:58.022 --> 15:00.491
legally get adopted by Stan,
change name to Stan Junior.

15:00.691 --> 15:01.658
DIPPER: Soos!
Aah!

15:01.859 --> 15:03.202
Oh, kids,
where have you been?

15:03.361 --> 15:04.908
W-what are you doing here?

15:05.113 --> 15:06.911
Stan gave me a mission
to protect this machine.

15:07.115 --> 15:08.913
Ha! And I thought
I loved snacks!

15:09.117 --> 15:11.336
Soos, listen. Something huge
is going on here.

15:11.536 --> 15:13.334
If Stan is hiding
some dangerous secret,

15:13.538 --> 15:14.915
we need to find out
what it is!

15:15.081 --> 15:17.129
I need you
to step aside.

15:17.333 --> 15:21.383
Yeah, just let us through so we can prove
this is all just a big misunderstanding.

15:21.587 --> 15:25.512
Guys, I know this seems crazy, but I promised
Stan I would guard this with my life.

15:26.717 --> 15:28.970
I'm sorry, Soos.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.148
Aah! Attack glitter!
It's pretty, but it hurts!

15:32.348 --> 15:33.691
Please, Soos!
C'mon, Soos!

15:33.891 --> 15:35.893
Aw, c'mon, I don't wanna
fight you guys!

15:36.102 --> 15:38.150
This hurts me
more than it hurts you!

15:38.354 --> 15:39.901
( Grunting)
SOOS: Aah!

15:40.106 --> 15:42.484
Seriously, it hurts me
way more than it hurts you.

15:46.446 --> 15:48.915
ALL: Aah!

15:49.115 --> 15:51.959
ALL: ( coughing )

15:52.160 --> 15:52.956
Ohh...

15:53.119 --> 15:54.587
ALL: ( gasp )

15:59.125 --> 16:00.877
It's like something
from a video game.

16:01.043 --> 16:02.590
Or a dream.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.921
Or a nightmare.

16:08.384 --> 16:11.934
I gotta be there
when it happens! Aah!

16:17.018 --> 16:17.985
ALL: ( gasp )

16:21.355 --> 16:22.948
Guys, are we dreaming?
Somebody wake me up.

16:23.149 --> 16:24.867
This...can't be real.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.241
I don't understand. Why would
Mr. Pines have all this?

16:28.446 --> 16:30.665
It's just like
that bunker in the woods.

16:30.865 --> 16:33.084
But what is it doing
underneath the Mystery Shack?

16:33.242 --> 16:36.837
Okay, okay, so he's got a huge,
gigantic lab.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.756
That doesn't mean
anything bad.

16:38.956 --> 16:40.378
Everyone's got secrets!

16:41.709 --> 16:43.803
It's still Stan,
and he loves us.

16:43.961 --> 16:45.929
And we love him,
right?

16:46.130 --> 16:48.053
Can't be...
it's impossible.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.601
DIPPER: The other two journals?!

16:50.760 --> 16:53.604
All this time, all this time,
Stan had them!

16:53.763 --> 16:56.482
I can't believe it!
Was anything he said to us real?

16:56.641 --> 16:58.359
Why would he have
those journals?

16:58.559 --> 16:59.560
Maybe he's the author.

16:59.769 --> 17:01.612
Or maybe he stole them
from the author!

17:01.812 --> 17:03.814
Maybe the reason he has
all of those fake IDs

17:04.022 --> 17:05.695
is because he is
a master criminal,

17:05.900 --> 17:08.028
and this machine
is his master plan!

17:14.282 --> 17:15.329
Whoa!
( gasps )

17:17.912 --> 17:19.630
"I was wrong the whole time."

17:19.829 --> 17:22.709
"The machine was meant to create
knowledge, but it is too powerful!"

17:22.916 --> 17:24.839
"I was deceived,
and now it is too late!"

17:25.002 --> 17:26.628
"The device,
if fully operational,

17:26.837 --> 17:28.464
"could tear our universe apart!"

17:31.008 --> 17:33.010
"It must not fall
into the wrong hands.

17:33.219 --> 17:36.849
"If the clock ever reaches zero,
our universe is doomed."

17:39.100 --> 17:42.650
It's the final countdown!
Just like they always sung about!

17:46.023 --> 17:48.446
The agents were right!
We have to shut it down!

17:51.279 --> 17:52.872
ALL: ( gasp )

17:59.495 --> 18:00.872
There! Quick!

18:03.916 --> 18:05.463
Turn these! Together!

18:07.962 --> 18:09.680
That's it!
The shutdown switch!

18:12.925 --> 18:15.644
This all stops now!

18:15.803 --> 18:19.899
Don't touch that button!
( panting )

18:24.854 --> 18:25.946
Dipper, just back away.

18:27.857 --> 18:30.781
Please don't press that shutdown
button. You gotta trust me.

18:30.985 --> 18:32.282
And I should trust you, why?

18:32.486 --> 18:34.159
After you stole
radioactive waste,

18:34.322 --> 18:35.995
after you lied to us
all summer!

18:36.198 --> 18:37.916
I don't even know
who you are!

18:38.117 --> 18:39.539
Look, I know this
all seems nuts,

18:39.744 --> 18:41.166
but I need that machine
to stay on.

18:41.370 --> 18:42.747
If you just
let me explain--
