10:33.920 --> 10:36.600

alien contraband.

10:36.800 --> 10:40.560
A few months ago, Vadic stole a
handful of classified weapons...

10:40.760 --> 10:43.730

you encountered.

10:43.930 --> 10:46.130
Its use
at the recruitment center,

10:46.330 --> 10:49.390

10:51.720 --> 10:53.700
The theft of something else?

10:53.900 --> 10:56.180
Steal the diamonds
so nobody checks on the pearls.

10:56.380 --> 10:58.840
It's obvious. They stole
a weapon ten times more deadly.

So we're looking for
a smoking gun

11:00.820 --> 11:02.840
that no longer exists.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.280
Then we just follow the smoke.

11:05.480 --> 11:07.190
The only way to identify
and retrieve this weapon

11:07.390 --> 11:09.800
is by getting ahold of
Daystrom's project manifest,

11:10.000 --> 11:11.150
its inventory.

11:11.350 --> 11:13.370
Which is heavily redacted
in the files

11:13.570 --> 11:14.940
that Ro was able to gather.

11:15.140 --> 11:19.470
Exactly. But the raw data
should be on a computer

11:19.660 --> 11:21.730
in the station's primary vault.

11:21.930 --> 11:25.950
So we burgle the very
institution hunting us.

11:26.150 --> 11:27.650
Excellent use of
the word "burgle," Admiral.

11:27.850 --> 11:29.650
WORF:
Since the break-in,

11:29.850 --> 11:31.870
the station has been
mostly unoccupied.

11:32.070 --> 11:34.650
It is patrolled by Starfleet
security every hour,

11:34.850 --> 11:39.010
but the vault itself
is protected by

11:39.210 --> 11:41.840
an astonishingly lethal
AI system.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.620
One that thinks,
that adapts.

11:44.820 --> 11:47.670
Fortunately,
we have acquired a key

11:47.870 --> 11:49.800
that should temporarily
disable the system.

11:50.000 --> 11:54.410
Unfortunately,
if this key fails...

11:54.610 --> 11:56.630
Well, instead of finding
one weapon,

11:56.830 --> 11:59.240
we'll be on the wrong end
of many.

11:59.440 --> 12:01.460
PICARD:
Ro believed this missing weapon

12:01.660 --> 12:05.080
to be central to the entire
Changeling conspiracy.

12:05.280 --> 12:08.650
This is the only way
that we can clear our names

12:08.840 --> 12:10.990
and save Starfleet.

12:11.860 --> 12:13.820
So...

12:15.560 --> 12:17.860
...any volunteers?

12:34.840 --> 12:36.720
Uh, it's good to see--

12:36.920 --> 12:38.540
Oh, it's great to be seen.

12:41.670 --> 12:44.250
I have gone into battle
with lovers countless times.

12:44.450 --> 12:45.810
- It can be therapeutic...
- I'm not going.

12:46.010 --> 12:48.770
That is a relief.
I was practicing deceit.

12:48.970 --> 12:53.210
Breakups on my homeworld
seldom end without bloodshed.

12:53.410 --> 12:55.520
Okay. Ready.

12:55.720 --> 12:58.480
We warped close enough
to beam you inside

12:58.680 --> 12:59.870
without alerting Starfleet.

13:00.070 --> 13:01.260
Ro's intel had a workaround

13:01.460 --> 13:02.740
for the transport inhibitors.

13:02.940 --> 13:04.610
But we'll have to get you
in and out

13:04.810 --> 13:06.400
before the manual
security patrol.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.710
How much time will we have
to find the weapons manifest?

13:08.900 --> 13:10.050
An hour at best.

13:10.250 --> 13:11.530
RIKER:
Oof.

13:11.730 --> 13:13.750
I hope this key works.

13:13.950 --> 13:15.760
Otherwise we're going
to have to resort to some

13:15.960 --> 13:18.930

25:35.260 --> 25:37.630
Sidney joined Starfleet...

25:37.830 --> 25:39.370
Any luck?

25:39.570 --> 25:41.370
I'm so sorry about this.

25:41.570 --> 25:43.580
You know how stubborn he is.

25:59.860 --> 26:02.040
- Off.
- Mm...

26:02.240 --> 26:03.860
I'm just trying it out.

26:07.560 --> 26:09.400
JACK:
Ooh.

26:09.600 --> 26:10.920
Let me see.

26:11.120 --> 26:13.570
That one is the <i>Defiant.</i>

26:15.220 --> 26:17.830
Mm, that's the <i>New Jersey.</i>

26:21.530 --> 26:23.500
Oh, wow.

26:23.700 --> 26:26.620
Well, this one is
my personal favorite.

26:27.620 --> 26:30.110
Kirk's <i>Enterprise.</i>

26:30.310 --> 26:33.380
All those perfectly clean
retro lines.

26:33.580 --> 26:36.290
Yep, I'm definitely
a <i>Constitution-</i>class man.

26:36.490 --> 26:38.340
That's a fair amount of history
for somebody

26:38.540 --> 26:39.730
who doesn't give a damn
about Starfleet.

26:39.930 --> 26:42.210
Oh, no,
I've always loved a starship.

26:42.410 --> 26:44.640
Well before I knew anything
about my old man.

26:48.380 --> 26:50.090
Oh.

26:50.290 --> 26:52.260
Oh, she's a beauty.

26:53.820 --> 26:55.430
Which one's that?

26:58.700 --> 27:01.060
The USS <i>Voyager.</i>

27:01.260 --> 27:04.370
She made her name
farther out than...

27:04.570 --> 27:06.840
any of those other relics
had ever gone.

27:09.410 --> 27:12.070
I was reborn there.

27:12.270 --> 27:14.420
She was my home.

27:14.620 --> 27:16.720
Her crew were my family.

27:19.590 --> 27:21.430
And now...

27:21.630 --> 27:24.380
You're just trying
to find another.

27:26.510 --> 27:28.770
We all long for connection.

27:30.340 --> 27:33.660
But we're just a little bit
alone, aren't we?

27:33.860 --> 27:35.750
Stars in the same galaxy,

27:35.940 --> 27:39.100
but light-years between us.

27:39.300 --> 27:41.930
Oh, you are definitely
your father's son.

27:42.120 --> 27:45.450
He, too, has a knack
for the, um,

27:45.650 --> 27:48.150
poetic drive-by observation.

27:48.350 --> 27:49.660
Can be very annoying.

27:51.010 --> 27:55.760
But it can also make a person
feel seen.

27:58.370 --> 28:02.380
Yeah, well, I can't say
being equal parts

28:02.580 --> 28:05.860
irritating and endearing
isn't entirely unfamiliar.

28:06.060 --> 28:07.650
[chuckles]

28:07.850 --> 28:09.300
[beeps]

28:09.500 --> 28:12.830
Ah. What's that one?
Is that a...

28:13.030 --> 28:14.350
Is that a Klingon Bird-of-Prey?

28:14.550 --> 28:15.870
The HMS <i>Bounty,</i>

28:16.070 --> 28:17.570
pulled from the bottom
of the San Francisco Bay.

28:17.770 --> 28:19.180
Yeah, right.
The whole whale thing.

28:19.380 --> 28:21.490
Story goes they had
a hell of a time finding it.

28:21.690 --> 28:23.220
It disappeared.

28:28.790 --> 28:32.230
Because the cloaking device
had reactivated.

28:39.190 --> 28:41.380
He wasn't trying to hurt us.

28:41.580 --> 28:43.930
He was trying to communicate.

28:46.420 --> 28:49.650
He was reaching out to us.
He recognized us.

28:49.840 --> 28:52.470
I thought Data died. Twice.

28:52.670 --> 28:53.950
He did.

28:54.150 --> 28:56.090
- This cannot be our Data.
- RAFFI: He appears to be

28:56.290 --> 28:57.700
some kind of hybrid--

28:57.900 --> 28:59.700
synthetic
with android interface.

28:59.900 --> 29:01.560
But it could be him.

29:03.520 --> 29:07.230
Data copied everything he was
onto B-4.

29:07.430 --> 29:10.360
His memory, personality.
His mind.

29:10.560 --> 29:12.710
And up to now
it's been unrecoverable.

29:12.910 --> 29:15.410
But since the ban on synths
has been lifted,

29:15.610 --> 29:17.320
nothing's impossible.

29:17.520 --> 29:19.280
RAFFI:
Looks like after Soong passed,

29:19.480 --> 29:22.630
Starfleet co-opted most of
his unfinished work.

29:22.830 --> 29:26.670
Hmm. They took a keen interest
in your sentient AI friend here.

29:28.330 --> 29:29.420
Hold on.

29:29.620 --> 29:31.240
What's that?

29:34.810 --> 29:36.600
- Altan Soong.
- [Altan sighs]

29:36.800 --> 29:40.770
Before I gifted Picard
my golem...

29:42.300 --> 29:45.440
...my intention was to live
beyond my years.

29:45.640 --> 29:47.350
To become my own legacy.

29:49.260 --> 29:53.620
Now I see, in my final days,

29:53.820 --> 29:56.490
that wasn't just poor humanity,

29:56.690 --> 29:58.920
it was poor science.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.070
<i>Because evolution is not</i>

30:03.270 --> 30:07.290
<i>an act of preservation.</i>

30:07.490 --> 30:10.600
<i>It's addition.</i>

30:10.790 --> 30:13.250
<i>GEORDI:</i>
<i>Sidney, she was the hard one.</i>

30:13.450 --> 30:15.500
Just... stubborn.

30:17.250 --> 30:19.860
In truth, she probably
got it from me.

30:21.550 --> 30:22.740
You always want to impart

30:22.940 --> 30:25.920
the best aspects of yourself
to them.

30:26.110 --> 30:29.140
I've recently been reminded that

30:29.340 --> 30:32.920
we are not in control
of what we pass on.

30:33.120 --> 30:35.140
Strengths, wisdom, talent,

30:35.340 --> 30:38.350
and also flaws.

30:39.880 --> 30:41.710
<i>Weaknesses.</i>

30:41.910 --> 30:45.850
<i>Sins of our past.</i>

30:46.050 --> 30:49.500
ALTAN:
Into this new golem will go

30:49.700 --> 30:54.070
a bit of Lal, B-4...

30:54.270 --> 30:56.160
of Lore.

30:56.360 --> 30:57.510
And, of course,

30:57.710 --> 31:01.780
a great deal of Data..

31:01.980 --> 31:05.040
this time with the wisdom

31:05.240 --> 31:09.920
and true
human aesthetic of age.

31:10.120 --> 31:14.310
With the hope that in totality,

31:14.510 --> 31:19.060
something-- someone--

31:19.250 --> 31:22.050
will rise to be the best of us.

31:23.180 --> 31:25.760
It appears Altan Soong died

31:25.960 --> 31:28.530
before he was able
to complete the project.

31:29.840 --> 31:31.940
The integration effort failed.

31:32.140 --> 31:37.060
All the personalities remain
at odds inside this vessel.

31:39.020 --> 31:41.820
<i>GEORDI:</i>
<i>I think back on those days</i>
<i>on the Enterprise,</i>

31:42.020 --> 31:44.430
all the danger
we rushed into.

31:44.630 --> 31:47.470
I never feared for my life.

31:47.670 --> 31:49.380
Not the way I fear for hers.

31:50.990 --> 31:54.570
Jean-Luc,
I want to help you.

31:54.770 --> 31:57.480
But I can't help you

31:57.680 --> 32:00.130
and protect them.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.270
I'm sorry.

32:03.470 --> 32:05.920
I really am.

32:10.010 --> 32:12.150
<i>- [door whooshes open]</i>
<i>- PICARD: We're leaving.</i>

32:12.350 --> 32:13.810
Your father can't help us,

32:14.010 --> 32:16.590
and I must respect
his wishes.

32:16.790 --> 32:19.630
However, he wants
to speak with you.

32:30.030 --> 32:31.560
Why won't you help us?

32:31.760 --> 32:33.900
Sidney, sit down.

32:43.260 --> 32:44.790
Now, Jean-Luc and I have
come to an agreement.

32:44.990 --> 32:47.270
You are going to stay here
at the museum with me,

32:47.470 --> 32:49.410
and he is willing to say
that you were

32:49.610 --> 32:51.450
- an unwilling participant.
- But it's not true.

32:51.650 --> 32:53.890
Sid, this is the way
it has to be.

32:54.090 --> 32:56.410
The galaxy is at stake here,
Dad.

32:56.610 --> 32:58.940
I've seen a corpse
that looked just like me.

32:59.140 --> 33:00.980
I know what these Changelings
are capable of.

33:01.180 --> 33:03.550
- We need to leave that
to Starfleet.
- I am Starfleet!

33:03.750 --> 33:06.680
I need you to be
thinking about us.

33:06.880 --> 33:09.210
I grew up listening
to your adventures.

33:09.410 --> 33:11.780
All the times you and Picard
stood up for what was right.

33:11.980 --> 33:13.340
- It was a different time.
- No!

33:13.540 --> 33:16.610
It is you and I
that are different.

33:16.810 --> 33:18.870
I'm not Alandra.

33:19.070 --> 33:21.080
I'm not an engineer like you.

33:22.340 --> 33:24.310
You built amazing things,
but me,

33:24.510 --> 33:26.620
I just wanted to fly them.

33:26.820 --> 33:28.490
You took that as me
rejecting you,

33:28.690 --> 33:31.320
but I always thought
it brought us closer together.

33:31.520 --> 33:35.830
You would believe in this
if you believed in me.

33:36.920 --> 33:39.230
Sidney!

33:41.060 --> 33:43.240
Have you any idea
how we felt

33:43.440 --> 33:46.250
when this ship went missing?
Hmm?

33:46.450 --> 33:48.250
Now you're out here
on the run,

33:48.450 --> 33:50.730
jeopardizing your future,
your entire life.

33:50.930 --> 33:53.560
- I'm on the run with my crew.
- They're not your family.

33:53.760 --> 33:56.640
Yes, they are.
You taught me that.

33:58.160 --> 34:01.000
And I'm not scared
to step up and help them.

34:01.200 --> 34:02.510
You are.

34:08.820 --> 34:10.270
<i>PICARD:</i>
<i>We're almost out of time.</i>

34:10.470 --> 34:12.400
We should return to Daystrom.

34:12.600 --> 34:13.790
Perhaps our only recourse

34:13.990 --> 34:15.750
is to take on
those ships ourselves.

34:15.950 --> 34:17.320
Battle stations?

34:17.520 --> 34:18.890
Sadly, I believe so.

34:19.090 --> 34:23.360
We should find Shaw
and strategize.

34:26.800 --> 34:30.290
So, you staying or going?

34:30.490 --> 34:32.410
- Staying.
- JACK: Brilliant.

34:33.280 --> 34:36.640
Oh, just to be clear,
I caused quite a lot of this.

34:36.840 --> 34:39.730
And your sister,
on more than one occasion,

34:39.930 --> 34:41.870
has flown us out
of the mess I made.

34:42.070 --> 34:44.610
Rather wonderfully,
I might add.

34:44.810 --> 34:47.650
Okay, let's reset our phasers.

34:47.850 --> 34:49.740
All of which is
a preamble to me asking

34:49.940 --> 34:52.090
two very simple questions.
One...

34:52.290 --> 34:53.970
how well do you know
this museum?

34:54.170 --> 34:57.060
Two... what's your temperance

34:57.260 --> 35:00.060
for some, shall we say...

35:00.260 --> 35:02.530
minor larceny?

35:04.230 --> 35:05.670
<i>RAFFI:</i>
<i>So Starfleet installed</i>

35:05.870 --> 35:09.980
an insane AI to defend
its deepest secrets?

35:10.180 --> 35:13.120
They used him because he's
a one-of-a-kind work of art.

35:13.310 --> 35:14.510
Certainly more brilliant than

35:14.710 --> 35:15.940
anything else they can
come up with.

35:16.140 --> 35:18.080
You know, he glitched
when he saw us.

35:18.280 --> 35:20.860
He recognized us,
which means...

35:21.060 --> 35:22.910
He sees everything
that comes in and out.

35:23.110 --> 35:25.690
He is not protecting
the manifest,

35:25.890 --> 35:27.510
he <i>is</i>the manifest.

35:30.990 --> 35:32.700
RAFFI:
I can see the files.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.220
Data should be able to tell us
exactly what the Changelings

35:35.420 --> 35:38.530
- stole from Daystrom.
- [alarm sounding]

35:38.730 --> 35:40.400

<i>Daystrom intruders...</i>

Are you there? Jean-Luc,

35:51.480 --> 35:53.070
do you read me?

35:53.270 --> 35:55.580
He does not.

35:59.200 --> 36:00.860
<i>SHAW:</i>
<i>Mr. La Forge,</i>

36:01.060 --> 36:04.120
uh, as a former engineer,
I just wanted to say

36:04.320 --> 36:08.040
what a, what an honor it is
to have you on board.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.950
Captain, your hull is
battered, bruised,

36:10.150 --> 36:11.780
and basically paper-thin.

36:11.980 --> 36:14.520
You're spewing fumes
through layers

36:14.720 --> 36:16.610
of 21st-century duct tape.

36:16.810 --> 36:19.140
Yeah, it's been a weird week.

36:19.340 --> 36:22.230
Which is why,
under better circumstances,

36:22.430 --> 36:24.530
I would gladly geek out
with you over

36:24.730 --> 36:26.880
the marvel of maintenance
and engineering

36:27.080 --> 36:27.930
that this ship is.

36:28.130 --> 36:29.500
[stifled laugh]

36:29.700 --> 36:32.190
Thank you.
Thank you, um,

Bridge to Transport.
See that the La Forges

36:34.090 --> 36:35.940
get home safe.

36:36.140 --> 36:39.460
[thunderous rumbling]

36:39.660 --> 36:42.200
Captain, we're reading massive
bursts of EM radiation.

36:42.400 --> 36:43.810
What the hell have you done,
Jean-Luc?

36:44.010 --> 36:45.200
Geordi, I assure you...

36:50.250 --> 36:53.350
- Admiral, we're now cloaked.
- PICARD: Cloaked?

36:53.550 --> 36:55.780
GEORDI:
You stole the goddamn
cloaking device

36:55.980 --> 36:58.050
from my Bird-of-Prey?

36:58.250 --> 37:00.000
Geordi, I would never
deceive you,

37:00.200 --> 37:02.780
and I would never steal from...

37:05.310 --> 37:07.710
- Jack.
- Sidney.

37:07.910 --> 37:09.410
SIDNEY:
We're phasing in and out.
It's not installed correctly.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.320
I think we either need to
oscillate the power resonators

37:11.520 --> 37:14.110
- or adjust the reflective index.
- Oh, is that all?

37:14.310 --> 37:15.980
But if we do either
of those things incorrectly

37:16.180 --> 37:18.540
or in the wrong order, it will
create a power feedback

37:18.740 --> 37:20.330
that will cripple the ship
entirely.

37:20.530 --> 37:23.110
Removing the device tripped
an automatic security alarm.

37:23.310 --> 37:25.550
Starfleet is on their way.

37:25.750 --> 37:29.470
Have you any idea, Jean-Luc,
how many Federation treaties

37:29.670 --> 37:30.690
this violates?

37:30.890 --> 37:33.260
Well, I guess they'll just

37:33.450 --> 37:36.600
have to add it to my tab.

37:38.250 --> 37:39.960
We need you.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.170
<i>She needs you.</i>

[electricity crackles]

37:46.990 --> 37:48.960
It's probably not
supposed to do that.

Inducers overheating.
I don't know how to stop

37:56.960 --> 37:59.580
- the chain reaction.
- But I do.
