01:31.440 --> 01:32.954
I'm Suzanne.

01:33.840 --> 01:34.830
My name is Phillip.

04:41.520 --> 04:42.795
I just...

04:42.880 --> 04:45.270
I need more time to collect my thoughts

04:45.360 --> 04:48.114
because it all seems like seeing a ghost

04:48.200 --> 04:52.911
and explaining to you what I saw
is like unravelling a mystery.

04:59.120 --> 05:01.715
Everything went by so fast

05:01.800 --> 05:05.111
and all I remember was seeing
the shadow outlines of people

05:05.240 --> 05:07.880
and then the darkness swallowed me up.

05:09.240 --> 05:14.713
I let my mind be invaded
by all the things I used to be afraid of

05:14.800 --> 05:16.632
that suddenly appeared.

05:17.760 --> 05:23.552
And it all seemed like a delusion.
So was I scared?

05:26.200 --> 05:28.556
I have goose bumps now talking about it.

05:29.440 --> 05:33.354
I was light headed, my palms were soaked,

05:33.440 --> 05:36.274
I felt my heart pounding in my throat.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.758
And then the adrenaline kicked in.

05:40.240 --> 05:41.594
So what do you think?

05:42.480 --> 05:46.076
Yeah. Of course I was petrified.

05:48.880 --> 05:51.111
Pain is so strange.

05:52.640 --> 05:55.200
A coyote that kills your little dog,

05:55.920 --> 05:58.594
falling off your bike as a kid
and scraping your knee,

06:00.240 --> 06:02.960
watching helplessly
as a loved one lays dying.

06:04.760 --> 06:07.320
Then pain arrives, bang,

06:08.200 --> 06:10.078
it's right there,

06:10.160 --> 06:15.633
it's very real and to anyone
who's watching this, you look dumb.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.155
Like you've been suddenly made a fool,

06:20.680 --> 06:23.752
and there's no cure for it
unless there's someone there

06:24.760 --> 06:27.070
who knows what you're going through.

06:27.160 --> 06:28.514
Someone who's...

06:29.600 --> 06:31.193
Someone who can help you.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.470
That's why you're here.

06:35.320 --> 06:37.391
We understand. We want to help you.

06:40.160 --> 06:45.713
But we need you to drag your thoughts away
from whatever it is that's bothering you.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.230
We need some details, Suzanne.

06:48.320 --> 06:51.279
Please...
You don't mind if I call you Suzanne?

06:53.920 --> 06:55.832
Why would I mind? That's my name.

06:56.960 --> 06:58.076
Okay then, Suzanne.

07:01.960 --> 07:03.633
Why would I mind? That's my name.

07:06.160 --> 07:09.631
Let's go back. How did your morning start?

07:11.560 --> 07:12.994
Okay. Okay...

07:14.320 --> 07:15.800
Morning...

07:17.640 --> 07:21.793
Well, it was slow. We had a few patients.

07:21.920 --> 07:25.118
Just a few.
The ones we had were mostly stable.

07:27.120 --> 07:29.316
How did you get involved?

07:30.440 --> 07:31.794
How did I get involved?

07:33.040 --> 07:34.838
I work there.

07:34.920 --> 07:38.357
I was just doing my job
when this shit storm fell on me.

07:43.520 --> 07:44.874
Okay.

07:45.480 --> 07:48.200
Have you ever seen this man?

08:00.720 --> 08:03.394
Before today
I'd never seen that face in my life.

08:05.240 --> 08:08.392
This is the man that saved your life, right?

08:09.600 --> 08:10.795
Yes.

08:11.440 --> 08:13.875
But what does that matter, he's dead now.

08:13.960 --> 08:17.431
I know it's been
a hell of a day for you, Suzanne.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.752
A lot of people died.

08:21.760 --> 08:24.229
And you were there.

08:24.480 --> 08:29.430
So we're just trying to figure out
why you were there.

08:30.040 --> 08:33.272
Aren't there security cameras?
Why can't you just check the tapes?

08:33.360 --> 08:38.150
I'm exhausted,
I wanna go home and feed my cat.

08:39.520 --> 08:42.513
Well, you'll get to do that
pretty soon, Suzanne,

08:42.600 --> 08:45.752
but what Agent Holman is trying to say here

08:45.840 --> 08:49.470
is that we're just really trying
to figure out how you are still alive.

08:49.960 --> 08:53.556
And I wanna know if she knows anything
about the assassination attempt.

08:53.760 --> 08:56.798
Just give me a second here, okay?
I'm getting into that.

08:57.320 --> 08:58.674
Look, what do you want me to say?

08:58.760 --> 09:03.312
Why don't you just tell me so I can say it,
sign a statement and go home.

09:03.400 --> 09:04.993
It doesn't work that way.

09:05.920 --> 09:08.435
As you know the hospital has been closed for,

09:08.520 --> 09:09.920
yeah, a couple of years.

09:10.000 --> 09:11.992
Only the ER is up and working...

09:12.600 --> 09:13.954
No video.

09:14.040 --> 09:17.795
Unfortunately,
we're having a delicate problem here.

09:17.880 --> 09:22.557
You see we can't secure a positive ID on you

09:22.640 --> 09:24.199
so we can't just let you leave.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.317
Check the personnel roster.

09:26.480 --> 09:28.756
I'm an ER nurse at Redondo Coast Medical.

09:28.880 --> 09:32.715
Well, the hospital's database
has been corrupted.

09:32.840 --> 09:34.752
But we do have
a couple of guys working on it.

09:34.960 --> 09:36.360
Might take some time.

09:37.840 --> 09:40.071
So how is this supposed to work?

09:40.160 --> 09:43.676
You want me to tell you what happened,
but we can't even get past who I am?

09:44.400 --> 09:46.790
I didn't do anything wrong.

09:46.880 --> 09:47.916
We don't know that yet, do we?

09:48.000 --> 09:51.960
Let's just... Let's, you guys...
Let's all take a deep breath.

09:56.480 --> 09:58.711
And let's go back to the beginning.

10:09.480 --> 10:10.994
Ironically, it was a slow day.

10:12.360 --> 10:17.276
Then several ambulances showed up at once
and it was complete chaos.

10:17.880 --> 10:21.032
I immediately went
and tried to assist Dr Todd...

10:21.200 --> 10:23.078
Yeah. Okay. Okay.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.389
What's happening?

10:24.480 --> 10:27.518
Well, it looks like we have
a victim with a gunshot wound.

10:30.400 --> 10:31.754
Can we handle it?

10:31.840 --> 10:33.672
Well, the rest of the place
might be shut down,

10:33.760 --> 10:35.274
but ER is still up and running.

10:35.560 --> 10:37.916
You two are here. My A-Team.
We should be fine.

10:38.440 --> 10:39.635
I thought you said one ambulance?

10:39.840 --> 10:41.160
That's what I thought.

10:44.160 --> 10:47.631
We've got a mess coming in,
we need everyone to triage.

10:50.960 --> 10:54.476
Prioritise, people.
Victims with vitals first.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.878
No heartbeat? No treatment.

10:57.960 --> 10:59.917
Dr Todd, we need you.

11:03.040 --> 11:05.600
Sir? Sir, can you hear me?

11:06.320 --> 11:08.198
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Where are you injured, sir?

11:08.280 --> 11:09.999
- Let me see.
- The head.

11:10.080 --> 11:11.673
Lay back, sir.

11:12.440 --> 11:14.159
- You cut your arm, yes?
- Yes.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.072
Okay. And your head?

11:22.160 --> 11:23.514
- You hit your head, sir?
- Yeah.

11:23.600 --> 11:25.831
- Do you think you have a concussion?
- I don't know.

11:25.920 --> 11:27.115
Dr Todd.

11:27.600 --> 11:28.829
What do you got?

11:28.920 --> 11:31.992
Head wound, possible concussion,
and an arm laceration.

11:32.080 --> 11:33.753
I think I can handle him myself.

11:36.280 --> 11:38.351
I agree. Get him stable. Come give us a hand.

11:38.480 --> 11:39.470
Okay.

11:40.640 --> 11:41.790
Sir, you're going to be just fine.

11:53.160 --> 11:54.640
I've got it from here.

11:58.760 --> 12:00.353
You're gonna be fine, sir.

12:11.960 --> 12:14.998
Take it easy. You're gonna be fine.
Lay back. Lay back.

12:15.640 --> 12:16.630
Okay.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.355
Here.

12:35.160 --> 12:36.640
Careful, careful.

12:44.920 --> 12:46.149
Listen.

12:46.760 --> 12:47.910
I need your help.

12:48.920 --> 12:50.798
- You need to help me.
- I know. Don't talk.

12:50.880 --> 12:54.317
You're in shock. You'll only say
something you might regret later.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.634
- Better?
- Yeah.

12:58.720 --> 12:59.915
Okay.

13:00.520 --> 13:03.513
You don't get it. It's a fuck up.

13:03.640 --> 13:06.109
It's a big fuck up. Okay?

13:07.080 --> 13:09.640
- Come back, please.
- Okay. I'll be right back.

13:12.920 --> 13:14.593
Security.

13:16.200 --> 13:17.600
Security.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.797
- What's going on?
- It's a diplomat or something.

13:19.880 --> 13:20.996
He's in bad shape.

13:21.080 --> 13:23.117
- Where is my security?
- Where you taking him?

13:23.200 --> 13:26.477
Fifth floor. There's still a clean room
and electricity up there.

13:26.560 --> 13:27.789
Okay.

13:28.680 --> 13:30.000
Come on, let's go. Let's go!

13:30.120 --> 13:31.440
Security.

13:32.920 --> 13:34.718
Where is my security?

13:39.360 --> 13:41.511
What are you doing? Sir, lay down.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.910
Lay back down. Lay down.

13:45.560 --> 13:46.755
What?

13:47.320 --> 13:50.597
Nothing. It was just weird.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.233
What's weird?

13:54.080 --> 13:56.390
His heart rate. It was steady.

13:56.560 --> 13:57.994
Slow, even.

13:58.680 --> 14:00.672
I mean, the guy was in pain, he was bleeding,

14:00.760 --> 14:03.434
but when I put my hand on his chest,

14:04.200 --> 14:05.998
it was almost like he was asleep.

14:08.920 --> 14:10.434
And again remind me,

14:10.520 --> 14:13.672
this was the first time that
you had seen Phillip, correct?

14:13.760 --> 14:14.750
Yes.

14:15.800 --> 14:17.075
You didn't know him from Adam?

14:17.400 --> 14:19.995
No, at this point,
he was just a patient to me.

14:20.560 --> 14:22.233
Hold it, right there.

14:22.440 --> 14:24.591
What do you mean, "At this point"?

14:24.680 --> 14:26.876
Well, he ended up giving his life for mine,

14:26.960 --> 14:30.317
so, of course,
now I'm gonna feel something for the guy.

14:30.480 --> 14:34.713
Just please help us make this easier
for all of us, all right?

14:35.000 --> 14:37.913
Maybe Agent Holman over there
could stop talking to me

14:38.000 --> 14:39.798
like I'm his red-headed stepchild.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.594
Come on. He's just being thorough.

14:41.760 --> 14:43.399
Yeah, a thorough asshole.

14:43.480 --> 14:45.597
All right! All right now.

14:47.320 --> 14:49.880
Let's just scale it back. Okay?

14:52.360 --> 14:53.350
Right.

14:53.960 --> 14:54.950
The Brokovich brothers.

15:06.600 --> 15:10.230
I've been tracking these scumbags
all over Europe for a few years.

15:10.320 --> 15:12.152
I know what they're capable of.

15:18.880 --> 15:21.839
They're vicious, ruthless, murderers.

15:22.200 --> 15:25.034
Ready to kill their own mother
for the right amount of money.

16:22.280 --> 16:24.920
So you can understand
that we're interested in

16:25.000 --> 16:27.356
how come you are still alive then?

16:28.160 --> 16:31.198
Because most people they get
in contact with end up dead.

16:42.600 --> 16:45.672
And how are guys like this
allowed to just walk around

16:45.760 --> 16:48.514
when you obviously
already know all about them?

16:50.760 --> 16:52.433
Did you see them?

16:54.240 --> 16:55.720
I was getting to that.

16:57.640 --> 16:59.757
- You can't get up.
- I'll be fine.

16:59.880 --> 17:01.837
Go help other people. That's your job.

17:02.240 --> 17:03.879
You're not well, you need stitches.

17:04.359 --> 17:06.795
I'm okay. I'm fine.

17:07.359 --> 17:09.271
Promise me you won't try to get up again?

17:11.119 --> 17:12.873
I'm not going anywhere.

17:18.200 --> 17:19.349
Where is he?

17:19.880 --> 17:20.869
Where is he?

18:05.840 --> 18:09.038
Rest in peace, brother.

18:26.360 --> 18:28.317
I will avenge your death.

18:32.040 --> 18:34.077
- No.
- Where is he?

18:37.800 --> 18:38.790
What the hell?

18:39.880 --> 18:41.678
Where is he?

18:45.680 --> 18:47.000
Dr Todd?

18:51.800 --> 18:52.870
Where is he?

19:00.640 --> 19:03.155
I've never trusted you, you son of a bitch.

19:03.240 --> 19:05.960
You were always the sheep
hiding among the wolves,

19:06.080 --> 19:08.151
now you're going to die.

19:43.080 --> 19:45.037
Out of bullets, asshole?

20:24.240 --> 20:25.469
Fuck!

20:28.320 --> 20:30.232
No, I don't get it.

20:30.320 --> 20:32.789
Why did you stay? I don't get it.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.196
Why not run?

20:36.640 --> 20:40.111
I don't know.
I'm a nurse, it's my job to help people.

20:41.200 --> 20:45.911
Look, at this point, all I knew is that
there was a crazy, insane, violent dude

20:46.200 --> 20:48.157
blocking my only exit.

20:48.840 --> 20:51.400
I was scared. I didn't want to die.

20:51.800 --> 20:54.440
This guy seemed like someone
who could help me stay alive.

20:54.520 --> 20:55.920
Come on. Please!

20:56.000 --> 20:57.753
Look, I don't know what you want me to say.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.958
I didn't do anything but survive.

21:01.040 --> 21:03.396
Since when is surviving a tragedy a crime?

21:03.480 --> 21:06.234
This is a matter of national security.

21:06.320 --> 21:08.198
And you have no rights.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.193
Until we're satisfied with all your answers,
you got it?

21:11.800 --> 21:13.598
If he's going to keep acting like this,

21:13.680 --> 21:16.479
then I'm just gonna stop talking
and you two can go fuck yourselves.

21:16.600 --> 21:19.115
- Hey. Hey.
- I don't need this.

21:19.200 --> 21:20.554
You need me, remember?

21:20.640 --> 21:23.109
- You need to pull that stick out of your ass.
- Mark!

21:23.240 --> 21:24.356
What?

21:24.520 --> 21:26.113
Shut up.

21:27.280 --> 21:29.954
Can you just go and check
on the computer system

21:30.040 --> 21:31.156
or do something, please?

21:31.240 --> 21:32.435
Yeah, I need to take a whiz.

21:32.560 --> 21:34.995
Fantastic. I don't care. Just go.

21:35.080 --> 21:36.560
Give us a second.

21:36.720 --> 21:38.791
- Enjoy it.
- Thank you.

21:44.720 --> 21:46.040
Sorry.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.269
Go ahead.

21:52.480 --> 21:53.800
What's going on?

22:00.080 --> 22:02.311
You're hurt.
You have to let me stitch your arm.

22:04.040 --> 22:06.271
Please! Let's get out of here.

22:06.360 --> 22:07.999
Come on, we can go in here.

22:08.080 --> 22:09.753
Come on, please.

22:12.600 --> 22:15.434
Come on. Right in here. Come on.

22:16.640 --> 22:17.835
Come on.

22:18.520 --> 22:19.874
Take your jacket off.

22:25.440 --> 22:27.272
Here, let me help you.

22:47.440 --> 22:48.794
What do you think?

22:50.360 --> 22:53.353
Here, look. I don't think she's lying.

22:59.120 --> 23:02.272
Come on, bitch. Give me something. Anything.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.634
She's lying.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.399
I can smell it.

23:19.080 --> 23:21.117
- Agent Holman?
- Yeah.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.275
Thank you.

23:29.560 --> 23:30.914
All right.

23:34.320 --> 23:38.360
Look what I found under the Christmas tree.

23:48.680 --> 23:50.239
They were all there?

23:53.640 --> 23:56.200
Yeah, apparently a goddamned reunion.

23:56.520 --> 23:58.079
What are you talking about?

23:59.080 --> 24:02.596
Well, the ex-Serbian
Minister's security team.

24:02.680 --> 24:05.195
- Yeah.
- Recognise any of them?

24:19.040 --> 24:22.590
So this is the deal. Klaus is the leader.

24:24.680 --> 24:25.716
What's going on?

24:25.800 --> 24:27.553
- He's here.
- Did you kill him?

24:27.640 --> 24:28.710
Son of a bitch escaped.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.320
This isn't normal...

24:32.440 --> 24:33.874
He is just one man.

24:35.080 --> 24:40.474
Find him and kill him like a fucking dog.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.836
- For your brother.
- I will.

24:44.960 --> 24:46.189
Go.

24:52.360 --> 24:53.953
He's in the building.

24:58.520 --> 25:00.239
Be ready.

25:01.080 --> 25:04.198
Okay. Okay.

25:05.840 --> 25:09.993
Dusan is the intimate type,
likes to work close in.

25:10.080 --> 25:14.996
He seems to prefer small calibre fire arms
and sharp objects to do his damage.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.960
And from our reports,
he seems to really love his job.

25:19.040 --> 25:21.032
A real piece of work.

25:29.600 --> 25:34.277
He was here in LA just a few months ago
and that's the last we heard of him.

26:14.960 --> 26:20.160
And then, we have Almira.
Now she's a bad, bad girl.

26:31.400 --> 26:32.993
Hey, baby.

26:33.960 --> 26:38.239
It's a little hot in here, isn't it?

26:45.600 --> 26:47.557
I had a really good time tonight.

26:49.640 --> 26:51.996
The dinner was excellent!

26:53.920 --> 26:55.513
Why didn't you order any desert?

26:56.680 --> 27:00.879
I wasn't really in the mood. But now I am...

27:02.960 --> 27:04.872
The question is...

27:06.040 --> 27:07.554
Are you?

27:18.520 --> 27:21.957
Love, where is your hair?

27:23.040 --> 27:25.680
Gone on vacation?

27:26.040 --> 27:28.714
And you will go soon...

27:28.800 --> 27:29.790
Nice.

27:29.880 --> 27:32.111
A long vacation...

27:34.840 --> 27:37.071
Don't work.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.351
Work kills.

27:55.680 --> 27:57.319
What are you doing?

28:07.240 --> 28:08.913
Bye, love.

28:43.400 --> 28:45.198
Ivan is the muscle.

28:45.320 --> 28:48.996
He can fight.
But usually, he doesn't need to.

29:25.200 --> 29:26.793
Have a nice day.

29:33.440 --> 29:35.511
Second floor, third, fourth...

29:36.160 --> 29:37.514
Go on.

29:38.240 --> 29:41.517
Yeah, those were the people
who tried to kill me.

29:41.600 --> 29:45.435
What did Phillip tell you?
Did he tell you what happened to him?

29:45.520 --> 29:47.352
That's when he started to trust me.

29:47.600 --> 29:49.512
Are we gonna be able to get out of here?

29:53.200 --> 29:54.714
How many people are trying to kill you?

29:57.560 --> 29:59.279
What are we supposed to do now?

30:11.720 --> 30:13.234
He told me he worked with them.

30:24.920 --> 30:27.799
He said he was here in LA for business.

30:27.880 --> 30:31.920
His boss had an important meeting
at the Plaza Hotel.

30:32.000 --> 30:34.231
And he was part of his security team.

30:42.240 --> 30:43.913
But that's when things went terribly wrong.

30:48.240 --> 30:49.959
Yeah, things went wrong...

30:50.760 --> 30:54.595
But, listen, we're more interested
in what Phillip told you.

30:55.880 --> 30:57.439
What's his version?

30:59.760 --> 31:01.513
I wasn't there.

31:01.600 --> 31:03.592
I can only tell you what he said.

33:34.640 --> 33:37.280
I need your help
to get me to the fifth floor.

33:39.440 --> 33:42.911
This hospital is basically abandoned
except for emergency operations.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.311
But I know a back way.

33:48.400 --> 33:49.993
So, I can help you.

33:50.160 --> 33:51.674
Do they have power there?

33:53.400 --> 33:54.436
Yes.

33:54.640 --> 33:58.236
Okay. We've got to get to him before they do.

33:58.320 --> 34:01.040
Make it faster. Please.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.359
I don't have anaesthesia.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.716
That's okay. Please.

34:10.360 --> 34:11.476
Hold still.

34:12.080 --> 34:16.120
So after all this you still went with him.

34:16.800 --> 34:18.199
What do you think I should have done?

34:18.320 --> 34:20.516
Run down the stairs
and ask the guys with guns

34:20.600 --> 34:22.478
to tell me their side of the story?

34:22.639 --> 34:23.960
I don't know.

34:24.639 --> 34:26.597
Can I tell you something
about your new friend?

34:27.800 --> 34:30.679
He's nothing but a cold-blooded killer.

34:31.440 --> 34:33.079
How was I supposed to know that?

34:33.159 --> 34:38.235
Not five minutes before, he saved my life
from a guy with a gun to my head.

34:38.400 --> 34:41.598
I just wanted to live.
I don't see how you can't understand that.

34:41.679 --> 34:46.072
So then you helped him
get to the Serbian ex-Minister.

34:46.639 --> 34:47.994
Helped?

34:49.080 --> 34:51.914
Yeah, if running and hiding
in a closet is helping,

34:52.000 --> 34:54.036
then sure, yeah, I helped him.

34:54.159 --> 34:56.197
No. I'm not accusing you of...

34:56.320 --> 35:00.439
You might not be, but your friend here keeps
acting like it's a crime I'm still alive.

35:00.520 --> 35:02.876
We're just trying to piece things together.

35:03.000 --> 35:05.959
Just to make sure that everything adds up.

35:09.840 --> 35:11.991
Want me to get you a calculator?

35:13.440 --> 35:14.999
Now, that's funny.

35:16.040 --> 35:18.714
But it doesn't add up.

35:23.480 --> 35:26.518
Can I tell you something
about your friend Phillip?

35:27.640 --> 35:31.475
See, Phillip was born in former Yugoslavia.

35:31.560 --> 35:33.916
At that time, Yugoslavia was held together

35:34.000 --> 35:38.711
by a communist dictator with the name, Tito.

35:39.320 --> 35:43.917
And it wasn't until the end of the Cold War
around '88 or '89

35:44.000 --> 35:48.597
when the wall came tumbling down
that the whole communist system collapsed.

35:48.680 --> 35:51.036
And with it, Yugoslavia.

35:51.280 --> 35:56.230
Seven different ethnic groups
now became seven independent countries.

35:56.400 --> 35:59.518
And Serbia had its brilliant idea
of starting a war.

35:59.760 --> 36:04.073
They invaded their neighbours
Croatia, Slovenia and Bosnia.

36:04.560 --> 36:06.950
Big war erupted.

36:07.200 --> 36:13.754
And over 300,000 people dead
and one million scattered in exile.

36:14.760 --> 36:18.515
UN? Nah. They did little to nothing.

36:18.600 --> 36:23.470
It wasn't until the US together with NATO
started to bomb the crap out of Serbia

36:23.560 --> 36:27.110
that this war finally could come to an end.

36:31.160 --> 36:33.311
Phillip had a father.

36:33.400 --> 36:38.077
A political activist and journalist.
Albanian.

36:39.440 --> 36:42.558
Now, that's a hot topic over there
in the Balkans

36:42.640 --> 36:45.633
to be a journalist and political activist.

36:45.920 --> 36:47.877
And he opposed the war.

36:48.480 --> 36:50.870
Especially, the ethnic cleansing.

36:58.120 --> 37:00.351
He told the world about this problem.

37:01.800 --> 37:04.031
And he received death threats

37:04.120 --> 37:07.318
and he was forced
to move his family constantly.

37:19.720 --> 37:22.394
Eventually, his enemies caught up with him.

37:59.200 --> 38:00.190
Are you okay?

38:02.000 --> 38:03.878
Go, go, go.

38:12.720 --> 38:16.714
That day changed Phillip's life forever

38:17.560 --> 38:20.200
and set the stage for what happened today.

40:39.040 --> 40:41.032
Dusan, what's going on?

40:44.320 --> 40:45.470
Dusan?

40:48.360 --> 40:49.874
Dusan, are you OK?

40:53.880 --> 40:56.076
Fuck! Fuck!

40:57.360 --> 40:58.794
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

41:22.080 --> 41:23.400
Are you okay?

41:26.080 --> 41:27.196
I'm okay.

41:28.200 --> 41:29.316
Should we take the elevator?

41:29.400 --> 41:31.517
No, the stairs. It's safer.

41:31.600 --> 41:33.990
Okay. Let's go.

41:36.400 --> 41:37.675
So then you knew.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.154
Knew what?

41:41.680 --> 41:44.832
You know, I'm a nurse
not a super sleuth like you.

41:44.920 --> 41:49.358
My job is to trust what people tell me,
so I can give them the best care possible.

41:49.440 --> 41:53.673
Can you stop rubbing
this noble nurse shit in my face?

41:53.760 --> 41:54.830
I'm not buying it.

41:54.920 --> 41:58.436
All right, all right, okay, let's just
take it down a notch here, all right?

41:59.280 --> 42:01.749
Suzanne, we are not the bad guys.

42:02.080 --> 42:05.790
And the more information we get,
the better we can do our jobs.

42:10.120 --> 42:13.796
Agent Sanders is right,
we're not the bad guys.

42:15.520 --> 42:17.671
So what happened next, Suzanne?

42:36.800 --> 42:38.598
I'm wearing down.

42:38.680 --> 42:41.240
I need some sugar, food, water.

42:41.320 --> 42:42.470
Okay.

42:42.560 --> 42:44.517
There's a break room just down the hall.

42:45.880 --> 42:47.792
- Let's go.
- Yeah.

42:55.320 --> 42:58.950
Radovan, I'm coming to you.

43:01.120 --> 43:03.112
On my way to the second floor.

43:20.720 --> 43:21.710
You okay?

43:25.800 --> 43:26.870
We're almost there.

43:27.000 --> 43:29.071
Here. It's right here. Come on.

43:44.040 --> 43:45.394
You're bleeding again.

43:47.160 --> 43:48.435
It's not my blood.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.520
Phillip.

43:58.200 --> 44:00.351
- What?
- My name is Phillip.

44:02.360 --> 44:03.680
I'm Suzanne.

44:04.920 --> 44:08.391
Suzanne. It's a nice name.

44:12.640 --> 44:17.072
You're the type of girl I would like to walk
with you in the woods and listen to the birds.

44:22.080 --> 44:23.958
Plus, you're intelligent.

44:26.440 --> 44:28.397
But I've got something to finish.

44:42.080 --> 44:44.151
We're going to make it, okay?

44:46.200 --> 44:47.429
Okay.

45:09.440 --> 45:10.669
Phillip.

45:14.640 --> 45:16.393
Why don't you come and get me?

45:26.160 --> 45:27.640
Don't be afraid.

45:27.960 --> 45:31.397
I promise
I will give you the death you deserve.

45:34.760 --> 45:37.480
Come out and die like a man!

46:24.400 --> 46:25.470
In here.

46:31.960 --> 46:33.792
He had time to fucking eat.

46:33.920 --> 46:35.513
Son of a bitch.

46:44.440 --> 46:45.430
Go.

46:47.320 --> 46:48.310
Over here.

46:52.720 --> 46:54.234
The radiation room.

46:55.640 --> 46:56.630
The door locks.

47:00.560 --> 47:02.392
Fucking imbeciles.

47:59.680 --> 48:01.831
Where the fuck are you, Phillip?

48:17.400 --> 48:18.390
Nothing.

48:22.440 --> 48:23.476
Ivan.

48:24.200 --> 48:26.032
Go.

48:26.640 --> 48:27.596
Almira.

48:27.680 --> 48:28.830
Yes.

48:30.080 --> 48:31.275
Go to the 3rd floor.

48:32.200 --> 48:33.350
On my way now.

48:33.800 --> 48:34.950
Let's go.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.879
Are these friends of yours?

48:51.520 --> 48:53.000
Something like that.

48:53.680 --> 48:56.752
Well, I hate to break it to you
but your friends hate you.

48:57.120 --> 48:58.839
The feeling is mutual.

49:05.920 --> 49:08.071
I thought you said
just one guy tried to kill your boss.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.117
There's a lot more people
than that out there.

49:14.200 --> 49:17.910
They're cleaners.
They're here to finish the job.

49:21.280 --> 49:22.953
Okay. Follow me.

49:26.160 --> 49:27.196
Yes.

49:27.880 --> 49:29.633
Here's the file you requested.

49:29.720 --> 49:31.916
Agent Sanders, they want you upstairs.

49:33.600 --> 49:36.513
Carry on. Try not to kill each other.

49:38.000 --> 49:38.990
Thank you.

49:50.040 --> 49:51.997
- Now what do I have here?
- What's that?

49:52.080 --> 49:54.834
Pictures of more bad guys
for me to not recognise?

49:54.920 --> 50:00.075
It's a file on one Suzanne Goodwin.

50:03.160 --> 50:04.480
That's you, right?

50:08.800 --> 50:10.234
You know what's in here?

50:12.120 --> 50:13.600
Let me guess.

50:13.960 --> 50:17.840
It says, I was a good student
but a horrible girlfriend.

50:18.000 --> 50:21.550
It says, when I was nine years old
I tried to steal a candy bar

50:21.640 --> 50:23.518
but then I freaked out and put it back,

50:23.600 --> 50:25.751
which then marked me as having
too much self-respect

50:25.840 --> 50:28.594
to ever be considered
for recruitment at any spy agency.

50:28.720 --> 50:30.757
Hey, listen up, Suzanne.

50:31.880 --> 50:35.590
I might drop this whole
"I don't believe you" thing

50:35.720 --> 50:38.519
if you can tell me a few things.

50:39.880 --> 50:42.270
Sounds good? Okay?

50:45.280 --> 50:46.350
Fine.

50:52.640 --> 50:54.120
Place of birth?

50:56.000 --> 50:57.320
Orlando.

50:59.320 --> 51:00.879
Mother's maiden?

51:02.440 --> 51:03.840
Davidson.

51:04.000 --> 51:06.879
Okay. SAT Score?

51:09.120 --> 51:10.873
That's not in there.

51:12.840 --> 51:13.830
No?

51:17.720 --> 51:19.313
This is interesting.

51:19.720 --> 51:23.077
It says here you were arrested once.

51:23.600 --> 51:24.750
Why?

51:25.440 --> 51:26.840
Oh, my God.

51:28.000 --> 51:29.354
You bastard.

51:31.080 --> 51:33.276
- You don't know why?
- Of course I know.

51:35.520 --> 51:37.193
Tell me.

51:37.320 --> 51:38.640
Okay, if I tell you,

51:38.720 --> 51:43.715
this whole "I don't believe you are
who you say you are" bullshit stops?

51:44.680 --> 51:48.151
If you answer my question,
I'll believe anything you say.

51:53.480 --> 51:55.278
I almost killed my boyfriend.

51:58.280 --> 52:01.956
I guess he wasn't really my boyfriend,
I'd been on a few dates with him.

52:03.360 --> 52:06.398
But he hit me
and tried to force himself on me,

52:08.640 --> 52:10.916
so I beat the shit out of him.

52:13.840 --> 52:17.117
He called the cops on me.
I spent one night in jail.

52:18.000 --> 52:19.354
That's it.

52:20.120 --> 52:22.874
You beat the shit out him.

52:27.400 --> 52:29.232
I have my black belt.

52:31.400 --> 52:32.959
Are you registered?

52:33.040 --> 52:36.272
My uncle taught me Hapkido martial arts
growing up.

52:36.840 --> 52:39.036
- Billy Jack.
- What?

52:39.600 --> 52:42.479
It's an old movie from the '70s. Billy Jack.

52:43.920 --> 52:45.400
Whatever.

52:45.480 --> 52:49.599
My uncle said a girl in Orlando
ought to be able to protect herself.

52:49.680 --> 52:51.273
It came in handy.

52:55.720 --> 52:57.200
Do you still train?

52:58.040 --> 53:00.271
No, I mean, not like I used to.

53:00.360 --> 53:04.798
And my job is physically demanding
so it keeps me in pretty good shape.

53:07.120 --> 53:09.715
Yeah, I guess I still know
how to handle myself.

53:10.760 --> 53:12.433
Are you satisfied?

53:18.520 --> 53:19.590
Yeah.

53:22.520 --> 53:23.510
1480.

53:24.920 --> 53:26.752
- What?
- My SAT score.

53:28.080 --> 53:30.197
1480 out of 1600.

53:34.440 --> 53:35.669
This floor is clean.

53:40.000 --> 53:40.990
I'm looking for her.

53:41.080 --> 53:43.640
Almira, they're coming towards me.
I hear them.

53:47.240 --> 53:49.675
Hey, Phillip, what's the rush?

53:51.200 --> 53:52.190
Run!

54:08.440 --> 54:10.352
She's coming your way.

54:11.080 --> 54:12.309
Good, I'm waiting.

54:33.720 --> 54:36.110
Where are you, fucking sobaka?

54:45.880 --> 54:47.030
Hey, there.

55:00.280 --> 55:01.430
You hear that?

55:03.520 --> 55:04.795
No. What?

55:07.640 --> 55:08.869
Nothing.

55:09.520 --> 55:11.159
No one is coming.

55:12.880 --> 55:15.440
Just you and me.

55:17.280 --> 55:19.397
Phillip can't beat Ivan.

55:21.000 --> 55:22.400
Never could.

57:55.800 --> 57:56.870
Okay?

58:02.400 --> 58:05.393
How long did it take
for the cops to get on the scene?

58:07.080 --> 58:10.551
I don't really know.
It seemed like an eternity to me.

58:11.000 --> 58:14.232
According to records it took 21 minutes.

58:14.320 --> 58:16.357
That's according to them.

58:17.160 --> 58:19.391
Well, you didn't see any cops?

58:19.880 --> 58:22.679
I was mostly inside running and hiding.

58:22.760 --> 58:26.071
I didn't see anyone
until I was on the fifth floor.

58:27.200 --> 58:29.078
So you killed Almira?

58:29.920 --> 58:32.355
- No. I...
- No, that's what you said.

58:33.600 --> 58:35.353
I wasn't trying to kill her.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.909
I was defending myself.

58:38.760 --> 58:40.877
But you're right, I mean,
maybe I should have asked her to stop,

58:40.960 --> 58:44.556
so we could talk it over,
over, like, a skinny latte or something.

58:44.640 --> 58:46.233
She seemed like such a nice person.

58:46.320 --> 58:49.916
I'm sure it was just a misunderstanding
that made her try to murder me.

59:02.360 --> 59:03.714
I'm done.

59:04.480 --> 59:06.676
I can't do this any more, it's too much.

59:07.120 --> 59:08.474
I'm gonna break.

59:09.960 --> 59:13.590
Listen, we're almost there.
We're going to make it. Okay?

59:14.840 --> 59:16.559
I want to leave.

59:18.640 --> 59:21.872
Listen, you stay with me. I get the job done.

59:23.240 --> 59:25.675
We better stay together. Okay?

59:26.760 --> 59:29.116
Do you really believe that?

59:29.200 --> 59:32.796
If you want a guarantee,
I cannot give you one.

59:40.200 --> 59:41.953
No, I'm gonna go.

59:42.800 --> 59:44.154
I need to.

59:54.760 --> 59:55.796
Thank you.

59:57.080 --> 59:58.150
Yeah.

59:58.840 --> 01:00:00.718
And good luck, I guess.

01:00:03.120 --> 01:00:05.794
- Can you just tell me why?
- Why what?

01:00:06.800 --> 01:00:08.234
Why this?

01:00:09.520 --> 01:00:11.318
What really happened?

01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:16.192
Stop playing me like an idiot.

01:00:16.880 --> 01:00:19.839
You're not protecting anyone
at this point except for me,

01:00:19.920 --> 01:00:22.435
and that's really a matter of circumstance
you put me in.

01:00:22.600 --> 01:00:23.875
Exactly.

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.995
Look. If these guys really wanted
to kill your boss or whoever,

01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:34.431
wouldn't they already
be up on the fifth floor?

01:00:34.520 --> 01:00:36.989
Listen, you can go now and get killed.

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:40.873
Or you stay with me. I finish my job,

01:00:41.880 --> 01:00:43.792
and you're staying alive.

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:45.870
Okay?

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:49.198
I'll take my chances.

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:01.231
So you just abandoned him.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:04.120
No, I just wanted to stay alive.

01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:07.072
I didn't abandon him.

01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:09.559
The story of his life...

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:12.953
What do you mean?

01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.191
After his father got killed,

01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:21.753
Phillip's mother was put on a watch list
as an enemy of the state.

01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:26.595
They confiscated all her documents,
she couldn't leave the country.

01:01:27.440 --> 01:01:30.035
And she was left with no other choice

01:01:30.120 --> 01:01:34.512
but to send her son across the border
with a family friend.

01:01:37.720 --> 01:01:40.997
You are an exceptional child,

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:42.958
you never forget that.

01:01:43.720 --> 01:01:47.316
Push your boundaries daily
and you discover your true strength.

01:01:48.320 --> 01:01:50.437
You were bred for greatness.

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:55.519
Me and your father, we did everything we
could do to make this life wonderful for you.

01:01:56.320 --> 01:01:59.950
Your father will live on through you.

01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:09.910
This man, he is an enemy of your people.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:14.236
And one day you must do
everything in your power to stop him

01:02:14.320 --> 01:02:17.597
and stop people like him. Can you do that?

01:02:20.480 --> 01:02:21.994
Yes, Mom.

01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:29.677
You will find that the pain
of losing someone never actually leaves.

01:02:33.760 --> 01:02:37.310
Don't you go one day
when you don't miss us immensely.

01:02:48.040 --> 01:02:51.112
The love in your heart
that we share for each other...

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:53.354
I love you.

01:02:56.080 --> 01:02:59.073
...it will carry you
for the rest of your life.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.150
Now to the kicker.

01:04:00.240 --> 01:04:03.233
The man who killed Phillip's father

01:04:04.120 --> 01:04:07.557
was the Serbian ex-Minister,

01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:09.916
Dimitri Petrovic.

01:04:10.920 --> 01:04:12.274
Jesus.

01:04:15.440 --> 01:04:17.830
Now, this friend started to train Phillip

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:21.470
in various forms of military
hand-to-hand combat.

01:04:22.160 --> 01:04:26.393
And he taught him everything
there is to know about survival.

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.390
And this family friend taught Phillip

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:06.190
how to live by the family code of Shala.

01:05:32.520 --> 01:05:36.196
What does this crazy man do?
Your friend, Phillip?

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.551
Now that he's a trained killer.

01:05:38.640 --> 01:05:40.677
He's a one man army.

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:44.079
Does he go after the guy
who killed his father?

01:05:44.160 --> 01:05:46.072
Does he take him out?

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:50.553
No, not Phillip. He changes his identity.

01:05:50.640 --> 01:05:54.156
He needs to get close to Dimitri Petrovic.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:18.429
Looks good!

01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.509
Dusan...

01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.517
So he moves in, moves in and waits
until he can take his revenge.

01:08:37.960 --> 01:08:42.432
Thirty years after
his father's assassination.

01:08:46.520 --> 01:08:51.037
Wait, you said the Serbian ex-Minister
was a gangster?

01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:53.719
Then how did he...

01:08:53.800 --> 01:08:58.511
Well, you buy it
or in his case you take it by force.

01:08:59.560 --> 01:09:03.917
He was a Bosnian Serb
who took advantage of the ethnic cleansing.

01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:09.917
He used the movement to gain influence
and amass a network of criminal activity

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:11.474
using the government funds,

01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.156
at the same time
that he was climbing the political ladder.

01:09:19.080 --> 01:09:21.879
When Yugoslavia fell it was complete mayhem.

01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:23.474
And Petrovic capitalised.

01:09:23.560 --> 01:09:26.997
- He took control over the arms in Serbia.
- Yeah.

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:30.357
And you control all the weapons,
you have all the friends in the world.

01:09:30.640 --> 01:09:35.590
And bang, just like that,
Petrovic was now the Serbian minister.

01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:41.078
Phillip waited 30 years to take his revenge.

01:09:42.080 --> 01:09:44.072
Let's call it a Balkan vendetta.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:46.158
It happens all the time over there.

01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:49.756
We didn't expect it to happen here,
on our territory.

01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:57.076
Look at this.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:07.517
What is that?

01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.111
It's the seal of The Black Hand.

01:10:11.760 --> 01:10:12.750
The what?

01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:16.273
The Black Hand
is a group of Serbian assassins.

01:10:16.880 --> 01:10:19.395
That's right. Your friend, Phillip,

01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:23.119
he's the assassin.

01:10:25.080 --> 01:10:26.309
Oh, my God.

01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:33.236
Now let me tell you
what actually happened at the Plaza.

01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:37.519
Our man, Petrovic,
was meeting with some Mexican drug lord.

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:42.160
They were going to help him to escape
to Ecuador or Venezuela.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.560
Why?

01:10:43.640 --> 01:10:47.190
Because they don't answer
to the International Court of Justice

01:10:47.280 --> 01:10:50.876
and they have no extradition treaty
with the US.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:59.317
You see, Dimitri was planning an escape
to avoid prosecution for war crimes.

01:11:00.160 --> 01:11:03.437
Phillip found out about this plan.

01:11:03.520 --> 01:11:07.230
Based on our preliminary assessment
of the crime scene

01:11:07.320 --> 01:11:10.518
there he was in the kitchen.

01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.432
There you have it.

01:12:25.800 --> 01:12:27.917
He's The Black Hand.

01:12:28.480 --> 01:12:30.711
He may have helped you, but...

01:12:31.760 --> 01:12:34.229
He would have killed you
if you got in his way.

01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:37.353
Probably good that you left when you did.

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.636
Actually I started to leave, but then...

01:12:44.440 --> 01:12:48.832
As I was going back down,
I heard someone coming up the stairs.

01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:51.838
So, I got scared and turned around.

01:12:53.720 --> 01:12:55.359
But when I got to the fifth floor,

01:12:56.440 --> 01:12:58.796
all I saw were bodies.

01:14:05.800 --> 01:14:07.280
Phillip?

01:14:15.160 --> 01:14:16.674
Who shot me?

01:14:17.200 --> 01:14:18.873
Am I safe?

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:23.592
Where is everybody?

01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:25.353
Please, help me.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.640
You killed my father.

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:40.997
I'm sorry, Phillip.

01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:42.873
- You killed my father.
- I'm sorry!

01:14:43.640 --> 01:14:44.915
Please don't.

01:14:45.800 --> 01:14:48.554
I can make you rich. Don't.

01:14:48.640 --> 01:14:49.994
That's for my father.

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:57.039
And that's for me.

01:15:07.240 --> 01:15:09.596
Was Petrovic already dead when you got there?

01:15:11.080 --> 01:15:12.196
I guess so.

01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:14.480
Who shot him?

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.914
I don't know.

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:19.000
Look. When I got to the fifth floor

01:15:19.080 --> 01:15:22.676
all I saw were dead guards
and I heard gun shots, so I hid.

01:15:25.440 --> 01:15:26.760
I can't tell you who killed him.

01:15:26.840 --> 01:15:28.752
You can't or you won't?

01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:32.633
I thought we settled this.
You said you were going to believe me.

01:15:32.720 --> 01:15:34.837
I don't know who did it.

01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:38.550
I was, you know, a little preoccupied
with trying not to get murdered.

01:16:07.400 --> 01:16:08.629
Phillip.

01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:17.274
Where are you?

01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:26.036
You're out of bullets.

01:16:58.680 --> 01:17:00.751
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

01:20:03.720 --> 01:20:05.712
You will die like your father.

01:20:27.360 --> 01:20:28.919
Must breathe in.

01:20:29.000 --> 01:20:30.354
Fuck you.

01:20:34.400 --> 01:20:35.800
- Hold.
- Police.

01:20:35.880 --> 01:20:37.075
Clear. Clear.

01:20:39.240 --> 01:20:42.472
I am sending you to hell.

01:20:48.360 --> 01:20:50.079
- Police. Police.
- Clear.

01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:09.674
- I got you covered.
- Come on, sir, keep going.

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:12.996
- Move it. Move it. Check him.
- Gotta get going!

01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.870
Contact!

01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:23.956
He's done, let's move. Push.

01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:35.320
And that's it.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:37.480
Sounds scary.

01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:39.070
Yeah.

01:21:40.160 --> 01:21:42.391
I was lucky to make it out alive.

01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:44.953
Did you see Phillip die?

01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:49.391
Not exactly, they fell through the window,

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.756
so I assume he did,

01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:55.231
and then when the SWAT team got there,
I heard them say they were all dead.

01:21:55.320 --> 01:21:58.233
Well, Suzanne, we couldn't find his body.

01:22:01.040 --> 01:22:05.000
Well, I don't know what to tell you,
I told you everything I saw.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.480
Well, it must have been Phillip then.

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:12.680
That killed them all.

01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:27.320
I need some coffee.

01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:31.000
Can I leave now?

01:22:33.240 --> 01:22:35.436
Give Agent Holman your contact info.

01:22:35.520 --> 01:22:39.639
So we can get a hold of you
if something comes up,

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:40.915
then you can go.

01:22:50.720 --> 01:22:51.836
What?

01:22:52.640 --> 01:22:53.710
Yeah.

01:25:08.560 --> 01:25:10.233
Thank you once again.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:11.356
Yeah, not a problem.

01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:13.957
Yeah. I know. Hi.

01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:17.958
We've got your number
just in case we need something else.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:19.549
With a "Z."

01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.036
What?

01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:26.352
My name. Suzanne with a "Z."
You misspelled it.

01:25:28.960 --> 01:25:30.519
How do you know that?

01:25:31.200 --> 01:25:32.759
Everyone makes that mistake.

01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:39.240
Here you go.

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:41.353
- What are these?
- Hospital staff directory.

01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:43.079
Finally got these computers to work.

01:25:43.200 --> 01:25:45.032
Already cross referenced
with the deceased list.

01:25:45.160 --> 01:25:46.879
It's not finished, but it's a start.

01:25:47.520 --> 01:25:50.479
If they have a body
it would be in the deceased column.

01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:52.153
All right. Thank you, Laura.

01:26:01.160 --> 01:26:03.072
- Hey, wait.
- What?

01:26:05.040 --> 01:26:08.397
You forgot to sign the statement.

01:26:11.920 --> 01:26:13.593
Down there. Yeah.

01:26:25.360 --> 01:26:27.750
My name. Suzanne with a "Z."
You misspelled it.

01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.269
She can read backwards.

01:27:24.640 --> 01:27:26.199
Your glasses, Mark.

01:27:28.560 --> 01:27:30.074
Place of birth?

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.675
Orlando.

01:27:34.240 --> 01:27:35.833
Mother's maiden?

01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:38.440
Davidson.

01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:42.669
She can read the files
through the reflection.

01:27:46.720 --> 01:27:48.200
That's impossible.

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.993
Suzanne with a "Z." You misspelled it.

01:27:52.120 --> 01:27:53.156
How do you know that?

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.640
But doable.

01:27:55.680 --> 01:27:57.990
- Yeah, what?
- Suzanne Goodwin. She's there.

01:27:59.960 --> 01:28:01.758
- Who?
- The nurse.

01:28:01.880 --> 01:28:04.714
They found her at the hospital,
tied up and gagged.

01:28:04.840 --> 01:28:05.910
What?

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:09.036
Fuck.

01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:58.278
Suzanne Goodwin.

01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:01.760
Thanks, Suzanne.

01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:29.234
Fuck. Shit.

01:29:30.040 --> 01:29:32.953
I'm gonna find the bitch. I'm gonna find her.
I'm gonna find her.

01:29:33.040 --> 01:29:34.269
Fuck.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:36.480
What now? Told you.

01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.800
Fuck. Shit. Shit.

01:30:08.160 --> 01:30:09.355
You okay?

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:11.634
I'm good.

01:30:21.000 --> 01:30:22.514
Breaking news.
