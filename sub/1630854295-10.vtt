WEBVTT

00:01.268 --> 00:02.903
Tonight, Gwyneth Paltrow,

00:02.903 --> 00:04.404
Oscar-winning actress
and founder

00:04.404 --> 00:06.540
of lifestyle juggernaut goop,
joins the Tank.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.575
I tend to invest in things
that I would use,

00:08.575 --> 00:11.144
a huge opportunity here.
and I think you have

00:11.144 --> 00:13.280
Our team of MIT engineers

00:13.280 --> 00:15.649
award-winning technology. developed

00:15.649 --> 00:17.518
Jica what?!

00:17.518 --> 00:19.486
Oh!
Jica yeah!

00:19.486 --> 00:22.155
I'm a little nervous, so I'm
gonna need a drink for this.

00:22.155 --> 00:23.657
I fell in love
with an acrobat,

00:23.657 --> 00:25.792
to a surprising discovery.
and it led me

00:25.792 --> 00:26.727
Oh, my God.
Whoa!

00:26.727 --> 00:28.295
Hello!
This is crazy.

00:28.295 --> 00:30.430
In just one year sales,
$1 million. Wow.

00:30.430 --> 00:31.832
O'Leary: No one is gonna
do this deal--

00:31.832 --> 00:33.400
not here, not anywhere.

00:33.400 --> 00:35.335
Who coined you
"Mr. Wonderful"?
He did.

00:35.335 --> 00:36.436
He did himself.

00:36.436 --> 00:38.005
Gwyneth, there's truth
in advertising.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.606
That's bold.

00:46.313 --> 00:47.614
First in the Tank

00:47.614 --> 00:51.552
is a healthier version of
a favorite breakfast indulgence.

01:17.844 --> 01:20.714
Wow.
This is crazy.

01:22.316 --> 01:23.850
This is Lindsey.

01:23.850 --> 01:25.752
Wow. Wow.

01:25.752 --> 01:27.521
Hi, Lindsey.
Hi, Sharks!

01:27.521 --> 01:29.890
Hi, Lindsey.
Lindsey is
the love of my life.

01:29.890 --> 01:31.058
And I am Samuel Taylor,

01:31.058 --> 01:33.727
Long Table in Chicago.
the founder of

01:33.727 --> 01:35.896
I'm here to offer you
15% of my company

01:35.896 --> 01:38.899
in exchange for $140,000.

01:38.899 --> 01:40.834
See, I fell in love
with an acrobat,

01:40.834 --> 01:43.303
to a surprising discovery.
and it led me

01:43.303 --> 01:44.571
Are you telling the story

01:44.571 --> 01:46.406
of how you won my heart
with pancakes?

01:46.406 --> 01:47.307
Yeah.
Nice.

01:48.442 --> 01:50.277
See, I badly wanted to impress

01:50.277 --> 01:54.047
this deeply charming acrobat
with a pancake

01:54.047 --> 01:55.682
that would be nutrition-dense
enough

01:55.682 --> 01:58.218
one of her performances,
to carry her through

01:58.218 --> 02:01.588
but also so light
that, like her,

02:01.588 --> 02:03.357
it would practically float.

02:03.357 --> 02:05.125
Damn.
Now, I knew that meant
whole grains,

02:05.125 --> 02:07.694
whole-grain flour out there
but there was no

02:07.694 --> 02:09.196
that was fluffy enough.

02:09.196 --> 02:10.864
So...

02:10.864 --> 02:12.432
I invented a new one...

02:13.300 --> 02:15.202
Hello! Oh, my God.
Whoa!

02:15.202 --> 02:16.603
...out of popcorn!

02:16.603 --> 02:18.872
Oh. Crazy. Wow.

02:18.872 --> 02:21.708
Popcorn flour
is a new twist

02:21.708 --> 02:23.744
on an heirloom whole grain,

02:23.744 --> 02:25.345
and it makes the lightest--

02:25.345 --> 02:26.380
Nicely done.
Thank you.

02:26.380 --> 02:27.714
Good job.

02:30.117 --> 02:32.586
lightest whole-grain pancakes
Popcorn flour makes the

02:32.586 --> 02:33.887
in the world.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.189
He invented a flour
for me.

02:36.189 --> 02:38.091
Of course
I married him.

02:38.091 --> 02:39.926
I love flowers.

02:39.926 --> 02:41.128
Good luck, my love.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.063
I'm out.
Uh, do you want a ride?

02:43.063 --> 02:44.765
Yeah, sure.
Let's go.

02:48.001 --> 02:50.771
Whoa. Whoa!
Oh, my God!

02:52.406 --> 02:54.541
Oh, my God.

02:54.541 --> 02:56.343
Wow.

02:56.343 --> 02:59.179
Wow! Good job.
That's great. Wow.

02:59.179 --> 03:02.649
So these are our farm-to-
table, clean-label pancake mixes.

03:02.649 --> 03:04.751
I sourced my heirloom grains
directly from

03:04.751 --> 03:07.287
organic and regenerative farmers.

03:07.287 --> 03:08.655
And now is the part
where I ask you,

03:08.655 --> 03:12.092
who wants to sit
at the Long Table?

03:12.092 --> 03:14.327
There you go.
So we have samples
in front of us?

03:14.327 --> 03:17.297
As long as you're not asking
us to sit up on that thing.

03:17.297 --> 03:18.832
No, no, no, no.

03:18.832 --> 03:19.900
Yeah, yeah. Dig in.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.736
are arranged thusly.
So the pancakes

03:22.736 --> 03:24.905
are definitely our best
The big pancakes seller.

03:24.905 --> 03:26.840
Those are the popcorn-flour
pancakes.

03:26.840 --> 03:27.974
It's very interesting.

03:27.974 --> 03:29.943
It tastes popcorn-y-ish.

03:29.943 --> 03:32.512
It's lighter than Yeah.
a typical pancake.

03:32.512 --> 03:35.615
That's also 100% stone-ground,
whole-grain pancake.

03:35.615 --> 03:36.717
It's very good.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.018
It's actually really good. Ooh.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.953
It's got
Thank you.
a crunchy aftertaste.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.456
That's very, very good.
Thank you.

03:42.456 --> 03:43.757
And then the other ones
you've got there,

03:43.757 --> 03:45.158
is my personal favorite.
the blue corn

03:45.158 --> 03:47.894
make great pancakes,
They don't just

03:47.894 --> 03:50.397
they also, of course,
make great waffles.
Ah, yeah.

03:50.397 --> 03:53.133
And one of my best customers
is reminding me of this fact

03:53.133 --> 03:55.368
so very frequently

03:55.368 --> 03:57.671
he should just come on down
that I told him

03:57.671 --> 03:59.439
and make y'all some waffles.

03:59.439 --> 04:02.109
he's America's friend...
He's my good friend,

04:03.110 --> 04:04.745
...Mr. David Schwimmer!

04:07.114 --> 04:08.381
Aw.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.588
There you go.

04:14.588 --> 04:16.323
Wow.
What?!

04:16.323 --> 04:17.424
Schwimmer!

04:17.424 --> 04:19.526
Wait, can I go hug him?
Hi, Sharks.

04:19.526 --> 04:21.728
I have to hug him.
Gwyneth, come here.

04:21.728 --> 04:24.598
We did a movie together
in the '90s.
for ages.
We've known each other

04:24.598 --> 04:26.366
Hi.
Hi. Hey.

04:26.366 --> 04:28.602
How are you?
What on Earth
are you doing here?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.036
I'll explain.
I know, this is crazy.

04:30.036 --> 04:31.304
Okay.

04:32.305 --> 04:33.640
Hi, Sharks.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.876
First of all, I just want to
say I'm thrilled to be here.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.878
I've been a fan forever.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.847
a movie together ages ago,
Yeah, Gwyneth and I did

04:40.847 --> 04:44.651
and now you're a wildly
successful entrepreneur,

04:44.651 --> 04:46.787
and I apparently
push a waffle cart.

04:50.457 --> 04:51.892
What's up, dude?
Hey, Mark.

04:51.892 --> 04:54.261
Let me move this--
this out of the way.

04:54.261 --> 04:55.996
I love waffles.
Yum, yum.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.597
Hey, Barbara.
Thank you so much.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.432
My pleasure.

04:59.432 --> 05:00.700
O'Leary: Right there.
Here you go.
Thank you.

05:00.700 --> 05:02.335
Wow. Raspberries and all. Nice.

05:02.335 --> 05:03.737
Thank you.
Hi, Lori.

05:03.737 --> 05:06.606
Hi, honey.
Hi, again.

05:06.606 --> 05:08.275
This is--
Crazy, right? Yeah.

05:08.275 --> 05:10.043
Mmm!

05:11.378 --> 05:12.779
You know what,
as a waffle,

05:12.779 --> 05:15.482
the texture even more.
I appreciate
Mmm!

05:15.482 --> 05:18.084
that corn more in my mouth.
I feel like I feel
It's really good!

05:18.084 --> 05:20.320
So, yeah,
I'm here, obviously,
This is very good.

05:20.320 --> 05:24.491
pancake and waffle mixes
because I think these

05:24.491 --> 05:26.726
are hands-down
the best I've ever had.

05:26.726 --> 05:30.530
for my daughter every weekend.
And I make these waffles

05:30.530 --> 05:32.465
Having said that, I'm not--
I'm not an investor.

05:32.465 --> 05:37.037
other than seeing the joy
I have nothing to gain

05:37.037 --> 05:39.506
these pancakes and waffles.
of more people eating

05:39.506 --> 05:41.708
So, um, you're
probably wondering

05:41.708 --> 05:43.810
how we know each other.

05:43.810 --> 05:46.813
I'm with a not-for-profit
theater company in Chicago

05:46.813 --> 05:48.281
called Lookingglass.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.718
And Samuel and Lindsey are
part of the Lookingglass family.

05:51.718 --> 05:53.320
They actually met
and fell in love

05:53.320 --> 05:55.355
working on one of our
seminal productions.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.356
Well, that's cool.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.892
Yeah, so,
when the pandemic hit,

05:58.892 --> 06:02.429
involved in live performance
all my closest friends

06:02.429 --> 06:06.466
in the theater were rendered
immediately unemployed.

06:06.466 --> 06:09.970
for 19 months.
Our theater had to shut down

06:09.970 --> 06:12.405
We had to let go
over half of our staff.

06:12.405 --> 06:13.940
And frankly,
we're still struggling

06:13.940 --> 06:16.376
to kind of find
our footing again.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.945
And we're one of
the lucky ones.

06:18.945 --> 06:21.548
Small and midsize theaters
all across the country

06:21.548 --> 06:23.316
have shuttered forever.

06:23.316 --> 06:24.451
So about 10 months ago,

06:24.451 --> 06:27.220
I reached out
to check in with Samuel.

06:27.220 --> 06:29.623
They've got
a four-year-old boy.

06:29.623 --> 06:31.558
occurred to me
And, um, and it suddenly

06:31.558 --> 06:33.894
that he should be
on "Shark Tank."

06:34.995 --> 06:36.429
It was your idea?
I was like--

06:36.429 --> 06:37.731
Oh, that's awesome. Yeah.

06:37.731 --> 06:41.101
So I urged him to apply,
and I told him
he got on, <i>if</i>

06:41.101 --> 06:43.370
and convince Lori,
that I would try to come on

06:43.370 --> 06:45.839
a fan of pancakes...
who I know is not

06:45.839 --> 06:47.607
I told you
I watch the show.

06:47.607 --> 06:49.376
Anyway, so that's
why I thought

06:49.376 --> 06:50.810
I'd pop in and say hi.
What a great story.

06:50.810 --> 06:52.545
Great, great story.
But now, uh...

06:52.545 --> 06:55.348
'cause I'm not a numbers guy.
I'll leave it to him

06:55.348 --> 06:57.050
with the theater.
Good luck
Go get 'em.

06:57.050 --> 06:58.885
Bye. Bye.
Thanks, David.

06:58.885 --> 07:00.687
O'Leary:
Bye. Thank you.
Well, that's wonderful.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.355
Let's talk a little bit
about your business,

07:02.355 --> 07:03.757
because the product
is fantastic.

07:03.757 --> 07:04.891
Why, thank you.

07:04.891 --> 07:06.526
I mean, I'm never
gonna eat anything else

07:06.526 --> 07:08.061
when it comes to pancake.
This is great.

07:08.061 --> 07:11.298
about popcorn flour, itself?
May I tell you, first,

07:11.298 --> 07:13.333
Okay. Yes.
That's what's kind of
the key innovation

07:13.333 --> 07:15.802
that makes us really different
from a lot of our competitors.

07:15.802 --> 07:18.505
And the reason why
is that this...

07:19.839 --> 07:22.175
whole-grain wheat flour.
...is five pounds of

07:22.175 --> 07:23.310
Okay?

07:23.310 --> 07:24.945
And this...

07:24.945 --> 07:27.414
whole-grain popcorn flour.
is five pounds of

07:27.414 --> 07:29.015
Wow.
Wow.

07:29.015 --> 07:31.685
So it's a lot lighter,
is what you're saying?
It is.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.820
Did you ever tell us what you
sell a bag of this for?

07:33.820 --> 07:35.989
That goes for $11.25.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.758
The cost of making those
is $3.10 per unit.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.060
You know
you're at premium price.

07:40.060 --> 07:41.928
There's probably
35 products out there

07:41.928 --> 07:44.097
that all sell
between $3 and $10.

07:44.097 --> 07:45.999
the top end of the market,
I realize that I'm at yeah.

07:45.999 --> 07:48.101
So let's talk about sales.
Let's do.

07:48.101 --> 07:50.704
million dollars in sales
So we've done a quarter total

07:50.704 --> 07:51.705
over the years.

07:51.705 --> 07:53.206
From 2015 to 2019,

07:53.206 --> 07:56.409
we did about $20,000
a year in sales.

07:56.409 --> 07:58.812
it's hard to live off that.
Doing $20,000 a year,

07:58.812 --> 08:02.415
And where's the distribution?
Where are you finding
traction?

08:02.415 --> 08:05.852
sort of independent grocers,
I'm in about 20

08:05.852 --> 08:08.121
mostly in the Chicago area,
which is where I'm based.

08:08.121 --> 08:10.023
of our business, 70%,
And then the bulk

08:10.023 --> 08:11.291
has been direct to consumer.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.892
So you're selling online?

08:12.892 --> 08:14.828
Yeah, just on our website.
We're not on Amazon.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.029
We're not on any of
the bigger players.

08:16.029 --> 08:17.764
So you haven't done
any work on social?

08:17.764 --> 08:19.632
not my strong suit.
Social media is

08:19.632 --> 08:20.967
Oh, that's a problem.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.335
That is a problem.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.449
All Sharks are still in

08:36.449 --> 08:40.220
on Samuel's whole-grain
pancake mix, Long Table,

08:40.220 --> 08:42.889
but his low sales and lack
of social-media skills

08:42.889 --> 08:43.990
could be an issue.

08:43.990 --> 08:45.692
is not my strong suit.
Social media

08:46.960 --> 08:48.461
Oh, that's a problem.

08:48.461 --> 08:49.729
That is a problem.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.266
I'll tell you,
you created a product

08:53.266 --> 08:54.901
to capture
someone's heart.

08:54.901 --> 08:56.636
How romantic is that.

08:56.636 --> 08:59.339
I don't think I've ever
even heard that story.

08:59.339 --> 09:03.176
You know, I'm not
really a pancake fan.

09:03.176 --> 09:06.713
was the best one
That blue-corn pancake

09:06.713 --> 09:08.681
I've ever had in my life.

09:08.681 --> 09:11.584
So, cheers to you
for that.
Thank you.

09:11.584 --> 09:13.420
I love it, but when
I invest in something,

09:13.420 --> 09:16.589
passionate about it and get
I have to feel super
behind it.

09:16.589 --> 09:18.825
And it's not
my right category,

09:18.825 --> 09:21.661
but good job
on what you did.

09:21.661 --> 09:23.263
I'm sorry. I'm out.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.564
Thank you.

09:24.564 --> 09:27.367
What I don't like
is a slow start in business.

09:27.367 --> 09:28.835
I think when you start
a business,

09:28.835 --> 09:31.171
the moment you think about it
is the moment in time

09:31.171 --> 09:34.207
that you have to grab it
from the sky, get it going.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.843
For me, simply because
of the slowness

09:36.843 --> 09:39.446
of the trajectory
of the business,

09:39.446 --> 09:42.849
I don't have a lot of faith
in it hitting the goal post.

09:42.849 --> 09:44.350
So, for that reason,
I'm out.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.021
Just to
I hear that.
counter that, you know,

09:48.021 --> 09:49.522
I don't know that
I agree with you, Barbara.

09:49.522 --> 09:52.892
especially when, you know,
I think that sometimes,

09:52.892 --> 09:57.297
migrating into another area
you have an actor who's

09:57.297 --> 10:00.066
and doing something with a lot
of heart and a lot of care,

10:00.066 --> 10:01.768
like, sometimes it
takes time, you know,

10:01.768 --> 10:03.403
along the way,
you're learning skills

10:03.403 --> 10:05.038
to be an entrepreneur.
you're learning how

10:05.038 --> 10:08.875
like, actor to entrepreneur,
So I just want to say,

10:08.875 --> 10:11.244
for you, and--
I have a lot of respect

10:11.244 --> 10:13.246
and I think
the product is beautiful,

10:13.246 --> 10:17.417
but the business is a little
small for me at the moment.

10:17.417 --> 10:21.020
but I'm regretfully out.
I wish you the best,

10:22.322 --> 10:23.790
Why call it "Long Table"?

10:23.790 --> 10:26.559
I mean, I get the farm-to-
table, but you're the pancake guy.

10:26.559 --> 10:28.461
You're all about
pancake <i>love.</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:31.831
So, part of what I am about
Well, I'll tell you--

10:31.831 --> 10:33.800
regenerative agriculture,
is about

10:33.800 --> 10:35.135
and it's about building
a supply chain

10:35.135 --> 10:37.237
from farms to consumers.
that goes directly

10:37.237 --> 10:38.872
But I have
a fundamental issue.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.773
I'm a big believer
in your mission,

10:40.773 --> 10:44.444
but sometimes it's the mission
that drives the company

10:44.444 --> 10:46.646
rather than the product
driving the company.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.081
You get so caught up
in the mission

10:48.081 --> 10:49.716
that you forget
to feature the product

10:49.716 --> 10:51.017
and you forget to make
the product

10:51.017 --> 10:52.752
what the company's
all about.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.854
And, so, I think you're more
on the mission first,

10:54.854 --> 10:56.222
product second.

10:56.222 --> 10:58.725
And, so, for those reasons,
I'm out.

10:58.725 --> 11:00.193
But congrats
on what you've accomplished.

11:00.193 --> 11:02.295
I appreciate that, Mark.
Thank you.
You're welcome.

11:02.295 --> 11:05.598
O'Leary: So, the way
I look at this is, um,

11:05.598 --> 11:07.433
this business
is very on trend

11:07.433 --> 11:09.869
for a change that's happening
in America on diet.

11:09.869 --> 11:12.839
I'm part of that movement that
seeks out food like this now.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.475
This is the kind of thing
that I can get behind

11:15.475 --> 11:17.477
because I would use
the product

11:17.477 --> 11:20.580
and I would explain that
to my social-media base.

11:20.580 --> 11:24.484
But what we've all learned
on "Shark Tank,"

11:24.484 --> 11:27.086
you have to have
a social-media platform--

11:27.086 --> 11:29.589
not maybe, you <i>have</i> to.

11:29.589 --> 11:34.761
I mean, this is the best
pancake I've ever had, period.

11:34.761 --> 11:38.665
If you told this story every
day on every platform,

11:38.665 --> 11:40.767
your sales would be
in the millions.

11:40.767 --> 11:42.435
And I'd be
a very happy investor.

11:42.435 --> 11:45.305
But you don't have that
and you should have that.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.606
And if there's anything
you learned here

11:46.606 --> 11:47.941
in the Shark Tank today

11:47.941 --> 11:50.410
is you brought the story,
all right?

11:50.410 --> 11:51.978
Now go tell it.

11:51.978 --> 11:54.480
I'm out.
He's right.
He's right.

11:54.480 --> 11:55.949
Good luck with it.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.383
And congrats, again.

11:57.383 --> 11:59.686
Don't diminish what you've
accomplished. It's amazing.

11:59.686 --> 12:01.187
Good luck.
Thank you.

12:02.488 --> 12:03.856
I didn't get a deal today,

12:03.856 --> 12:05.658
but I got some great advice
from the Sharks.

12:05.658 --> 12:08.795
And hopefully, with the power
of the Shark Tank behind me,

12:08.795 --> 12:11.764
in terms of getting to
tell my story to people

12:11.764 --> 12:13.600
and that advice,

12:13.600 --> 12:15.068
in a very different position
I hope to be

12:15.068 --> 12:16.603
in a couple of years.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.244
Thanks.
Best pancake.

12:29.315 --> 12:32.418
I was born into
a show-business family.

12:32.418 --> 12:34.988
My mother is an
amazing actress,

12:34.988 --> 12:38.424
and my mother was a television
producer and a director.

12:38.424 --> 12:42.362
For as long as I can remember,
I wanted to be an actor.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.697
my mother rehearse plays
I used to watch

12:44.697 --> 12:46.165
when I was very, very little.

12:46.165 --> 12:47.867
She was so inspiring.

12:47.867 --> 12:49.636
especially my father,
My parents,

12:49.636 --> 12:52.305
was really, really
strict around

12:52.305 --> 12:54.507
having a very, very strong
work ethic.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.276
He would never give me a dime.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.645
It instilled in me
that working hard

12:58.645 --> 13:01.648
and having a consciousness
of manifestation,

13:01.648 --> 13:03.916
you can-- you can do it.

13:03.916 --> 13:05.585
I worked pretty steadily,

13:05.585 --> 13:09.322
a big turning point in 1998
and then I had

13:09.322 --> 13:11.190
when "Shakespeare in Love"
came out.

13:11.190 --> 13:14.027
I was getting lots of awards.
It changed my life.

13:14.027 --> 13:16.496
It was an incredibly
intense year.

13:16.496 --> 13:17.997
I did a film in Paris,

13:17.997 --> 13:19.899
and I remember being
really struck

13:19.899 --> 13:23.403
find what the great cafés were
by how difficult it was to

13:23.403 --> 13:26.506
and wellness practitioners.
and stores

13:26.506 --> 13:29.842
And that's really where the
very, very kernel of the idea

13:29.842 --> 13:31.678
for goop was born.

13:31.678 --> 13:34.047
I was living in London
In 2008,

13:34.047 --> 13:36.883
the first goop newsletter.
and pressed "send" on

13:36.883 --> 13:40.286
In a nutshell, goop is a
multi-vertical lifestyle brand.

13:40.286 --> 13:44.824
wellness, home, fashion, food
We have clean beauty, delivery.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.326
We have five retail stores.

13:46.326 --> 13:50.029
We launched a podcast that has
more than 30 million downloads.

13:50.029 --> 13:54.233
We have over 200 employees,
over 8 million subscribers,

13:54.233 --> 13:58.204
and at our last valuation,
we were valued at $390
million.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.807
People thought I was crazy
for walking away

14:00.807 --> 14:04.310
from this big movie-star
career and being a startup founder.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.511
But for me, it's been

14:05.511 --> 14:08.481
an incredibly fulfilling transition.

14:08.481 --> 14:10.316
We want it to
feel sexy, right?
Yeah.

14:10.316 --> 14:12.251
So I think
the spice does that.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.955
identifying trends very early
I think I'm good at

14:15.955 --> 14:18.091
and where the consumer
is thinking about going

14:18.091 --> 14:19.792
before they even know.

14:19.792 --> 14:21.828
I want to be
a Shark because

14:21.828 --> 14:24.564
I have an extra-soft spot
for entrepreneurs

14:24.564 --> 14:26.032
because it's so hard.

14:26.032 --> 14:29.235
You're pushing a boulder up
the same hill every day.

14:29.235 --> 14:31.270
around every corner.
There's problems

14:31.270 --> 14:34.774
I have always leaned
into helping other entrepreneurs

14:34.774 --> 14:37.343
because I respect
the journey so much.

14:37.343 --> 14:40.446
leather one with the tie.
I like the simplified

14:40.446 --> 14:42.548
I think the great thing
about "Shark Tank"

14:42.548 --> 14:44.784
is that it really
sets the stage

14:44.784 --> 14:47.587
for people to accelerate
the growth of their business

14:47.587 --> 14:50.656
and to really have a seat
on the world stage.

14:50.656 --> 14:53.626
It's a huge opportunity to go
from being in your garage

14:53.626 --> 14:55.027
trying to make a product

14:55.027 --> 14:57.964
to being able to show
America and the world

14:57.964 --> 15:00.500
that you have something
viable and exciting.

15:12.645 --> 15:17.016
Next up is a product designed
to help you keep your cool.

15:28.594 --> 15:31.164
and this is my wife, Lisa.
Hi, Sharks. I'm Randall,

15:31.164 --> 15:33.966
We're from Austin, Texas, and
we are the founders of VoChill.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.135
We are here
seeking $300,000

15:36.135 --> 15:38.471
for a 5% stake
in our company.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.273
Hang on, Sharks.
I'm a little nervous,

15:40.273 --> 15:42.375
so I'm gonna need
a drink for this.

15:44.110 --> 15:45.211
Wh-What are you doing?

15:45.211 --> 15:46.412
bottle of wine,
That was a really nice

15:46.412 --> 15:48.014
and you're gonna
put ice in it?

15:48.014 --> 15:50.316
Well, it's getting kind
of warm in here.

15:50.316 --> 15:52.518
And who likes warm wine?

15:52.518 --> 15:53.786
No one. No one.

15:53.786 --> 15:55.521
of crazy things
People do all kinds

15:55.521 --> 15:56.856
to keep their wine chilled,

15:56.856 --> 15:59.459
from putting ice in it
or other frozen things,

15:59.459 --> 16:01.427
to using these metal cups,

16:01.427 --> 16:03.529
which, you can't see
the wine or smell it,

16:03.529 --> 16:06.098
and they just make
your wine taste awful.

16:06.098 --> 16:07.567
And none
of these things work.

16:07.567 --> 16:11.471
So that's why
we created VoChill.

16:11.471 --> 16:15.441
The world's first and only
personal wine chiller.

16:15.441 --> 16:18.211
It keeps your wine crisp,
cool, and refreshing

16:18.211 --> 16:21.347
without compromising the wine
or the wine experience.

16:21.347 --> 16:23.583
That's right.
With our innovative design

16:23.583 --> 16:27.286
cradle that is re-freezable,
and its detachable chill

16:27.286 --> 16:29.589
in VoChill
you simply rest your glass

16:29.589 --> 16:31.457
perfectly chilled
between sips to keep your wine

16:31.457 --> 16:33.292
from the first sip
to the last.

16:33.292 --> 16:34.827
And it's incredible
for reds.

16:34.827 --> 16:37.363
It'll bring a room-temperature
red down to cellar temp

16:37.363 --> 16:38.531
in about 10 minutes,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.766
bringing out the wine's
best characteristics.

16:40.766 --> 16:42.568
It's genius!

16:42.568 --> 16:45.505
And it's become your
new best friend.
So say you.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.240
to introduce you
Sharks, we are here

16:47.240 --> 16:49.342
to the future
of wine enjoyment.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.543
So, who here...

16:50.543 --> 16:51.844
Or how many of you...

16:51.844 --> 16:54.947
...want to sip,
savor, and chill with us?

16:56.949 --> 16:58.784
So, Sharks, you have samples
in front of you.

16:58.784 --> 17:00.019
You have some wine.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.821
To chill it down, do you have
to put the whole unit

17:01.821 --> 17:03.823
No, sir.
in the freezer?

17:03.823 --> 17:06.993
So you just--- this top
portion is separable from the stand.

17:06.993 --> 17:08.928
So this part you just
keep in the freezer.

17:08.928 --> 17:10.129
So it takes up minimal--
It's very cold.

17:10.129 --> 17:11.397
It is.
Very cold.

17:11.397 --> 17:13.232
It takes up minimal
freezer space.
Very cold.

17:13.232 --> 17:14.700
Hello.

17:14.700 --> 17:16.202
Yes, Mark,
you have a martini.

17:16.202 --> 17:19.839
Mark has a martini, so...
O'Leary: Ohhh.

17:19.839 --> 17:20.873
Yes, I do!

17:20.873 --> 17:22.341
Yes, we often get
questions like,

17:22.341 --> 17:24.677
does it work with
martinis or beers?

17:24.677 --> 17:26.546
Anything besides wine?
Of course it does.

17:26.546 --> 17:29.048
Can you tell me what you sell
it for and what it costs to
make?

17:29.048 --> 17:33.419
The stemmed version
is $49.95,

17:33.419 --> 17:36.389
and the stemless version
is $44.95.

17:36.389 --> 17:38.624
It costs us $9.21
to make the stem

17:38.624 --> 17:41.027
and $8.62
to make the stemless.

17:41.027 --> 17:42.595
Do you sell it online?

17:42.595 --> 17:43.996
Yes, on our website.

17:43.996 --> 17:45.498
If you put one
in the freezer,

17:45.498 --> 17:47.099
how are you modulating
the temperature

17:47.099 --> 17:48.801
between the reds
and the whites?

17:48.801 --> 17:51.504
'Cause I like my white
super-ice-cold

17:51.504 --> 17:53.172
and the red not as cold.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.808
Sure. So the--
for white wines,

17:55.808 --> 17:58.945
it's designed to preserve
the chill in the glass, right?
Okay.

17:58.945 --> 18:02.214
For red wine, it'll bring
a room-temperature red

18:02.214 --> 18:06.819
down to 65 degrees, or cellar
temp, in about 10 minutes.

18:06.819 --> 18:10.022
O'Leary: So I'm in the wine
business, as you know. Yes.

18:10.022 --> 18:13.559
understand how that started...
Icing wine, just so we

18:13.559 --> 18:14.827
Oh, shoot me now.

18:14.827 --> 18:16.495
...Saint-Tropez, 1955,

18:16.495 --> 18:20.032
Brigitte Bardot, <i>cinquante
- cinq,</i> was shooting a film.

18:20.032 --> 18:22.501
She asked the server,
because she was so hot,

18:22.501 --> 18:25.438
to put some ice in the rosé,
and he'd say--

18:25.438 --> 18:26.572
He was shocked.

18:26.572 --> 18:29.241
Today, 50% of rosé
is consumed with ice,

18:29.241 --> 18:32.378
rosés are blended differently.
and as a result, now

18:32.378 --> 18:34.347
to do with why
That has nothing

18:34.347 --> 18:36.015
The point is,
50% today put in ice.

18:36.015 --> 18:39.051
not everybody needs
to chill their wine.

18:39.051 --> 18:42.822
imputes to $6 million value.
$300,000, 5%,

18:42.822 --> 18:45.291
You got to be selling
a ton of these, right?

18:45.291 --> 18:49.629
So, uh, last year we did
$800,000, $820,000 in sales.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.263
That's healthy.

18:51.263 --> 18:53.499
Yes, we've been around
less than two years.

18:53.499 --> 18:56.302
Congrats. Whoa. Amazing.
Just with these two SKUs?

18:56.302 --> 18:57.837
That was just--
Well--

18:57.837 --> 19:00.006
Last year, that was just
with that stem SKU

19:00.006 --> 19:01.140
and only three colors.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.708
And where were you
selling these that?

19:02.708 --> 19:05.711
On our website
and on Amazon.

19:05.711 --> 19:06.912
And this year?

19:06.912 --> 19:08.014
$1.8 million.

19:08.014 --> 19:09.015
$1.8? Wow.

19:09.015 --> 19:10.116
Are you making any money

19:10.116 --> 19:12.518
after customer acquisition
on this?

19:12.518 --> 19:14.253
We are not making
any money yet.

19:14.253 --> 19:16.455
We're not profitable yet.
Why?

19:16.455 --> 19:19.158
Because it's costing so much
to acquire the customer, right?

19:19.158 --> 19:21.994
Our acquisition,
our CPA, is $57.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.296
$57 an hour.
There you go.
That's a lot.

19:24.296 --> 19:26.132
you're here, right?
Which is why

19:26.132 --> 19:27.767
Your EBITDA loss last year?

19:27.767 --> 19:32.471
Our cash loss last year
was $470,000.
Wow.

19:32.471 --> 19:35.441
What has the reaction been
from wine drinkers

19:35.441 --> 19:37.076
and the wine community?

19:37.076 --> 19:38.277
They love it.
Very strong, very good.

19:38.277 --> 19:40.012
here's an offer, okay?
Hey, guys,

19:40.012 --> 19:41.647
I have zero flexibility.

19:41.647 --> 19:43.315
That's why they call me
"Mr. Wonderful."

19:43.315 --> 19:46.786
This company is not worth
$6 million right now. Sorry.

19:46.786 --> 19:50.056
So, I'll do the $300,000
for 10%,

19:50.056 --> 19:53.426
but I want a $2 royalty until
I recoup a million dollars.

19:53.426 --> 19:54.627
Okay?

19:54.627 --> 19:56.562
Then the royalty goes away.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.997
And then I have 10%
of the company,

19:57.997 --> 19:59.565
and I'm still incentivized

19:59.565 --> 20:00.666
to keep growing it.

20:00.666 --> 20:02.902
The trouble with your deal
is your CAC,

20:02.902 --> 20:05.604
your customer-acquisition
cost, is too high.

20:05.604 --> 20:08.708
I think I can help you reduce
that dramatically.

20:08.708 --> 20:10.309
Guys, I'll simplify it for you.

20:10.309 --> 20:12.378
Kevin's the wine guy, right?

20:12.378 --> 20:15.481
But it's just not a fit for
me. So for those reasons, I'm
out.

20:15.481 --> 20:16.615
Thank you.
Thank you, Mark.

20:16.615 --> 20:18.417
functionally, I love this
I think,

20:18.417 --> 20:19.885
because it makes great sense,

20:19.885 --> 20:22.321
it's so ugly-looking.
but I think
Oh, I love it.

20:22.321 --> 20:24.957
I have a beautiful kitchen,
beautiful dishes,

20:24.957 --> 20:27.493
everything's beautiful
beautiful, beautiful.

20:27.493 --> 20:29.595
I would have to hide it. Hm.

20:29.595 --> 20:32.298
So, for that reason, I'm out.

20:32.298 --> 20:35.401
Um, for me,
I tend to really invest

20:35.401 --> 20:36.736
in things that I would use,

20:36.736 --> 20:39.772
and every wine, like, "trick"
that I've ever bought,

20:39.772 --> 20:41.574
I just-- I never
implement it.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.776
I got the thing that, you
know, sucks the air out

20:43.776 --> 20:45.544
so you could have
one nice glass at a time.

20:45.544 --> 20:46.946
I never used it.

20:46.946 --> 20:49.115
I tried to use it once,
I thought it was gonna explode.

20:49.115 --> 20:51.851
That's why they're called
"wine accessories."
Right.

20:53.119 --> 20:55.287
So I love this, and I think
you're gonna do great

20:55.287 --> 20:56.555
but for those reasons,
I'm out.

20:56.555 --> 20:57.890
Okay. Thank you.
Thank you.

20:57.890 --> 21:01.460
And I will tell you,
I would be sitting there

21:01.460 --> 21:02.728
trying to, like, change it,

21:02.728 --> 21:04.930
and to make it simpler,
to make it smaller

21:04.930 --> 21:06.499
all of this stuff.
and, you know,

21:06.499 --> 21:09.235
what you need or what you
I don't think that's
want.

21:09.235 --> 21:10.669
I wish you good luck,

21:10.669 --> 21:12.271
it's the right product for me.
but I don't think

21:12.271 --> 21:13.506
I'm sorry. I'm out.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.808
Thank you.
Thank you, Lori.
Appreciate that.

21:15.808 --> 21:17.409
So, go ahead
and say it, Kevin.

21:17.409 --> 21:19.011
All roads
lead back to him.

21:19.011 --> 21:21.514
As usual, all roads lead back
to Mr. Wonderful.

21:21.514 --> 21:24.850
Who coined you
You know, the--
"Mr. Wonderful"?

21:24.850 --> 21:26.352
He did himself.
He did.

21:26.352 --> 21:27.753
You did that
to yourself?

21:27.753 --> 21:29.822
Gwyneth, there's truth
in advertising.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.191
Wow. That's bold.

21:32.191 --> 21:34.326
I know and I respect
The point is,

21:34.326 --> 21:36.662
to protect your valuation,
that you're trying

21:36.662 --> 21:38.964
if you should really sweat
but I don't know that.

21:38.964 --> 21:40.366
You should try and figure out,

21:40.366 --> 21:42.701
what's the best deal
for you and this product?

21:42.701 --> 21:44.103
How can you blow this up?

21:44.103 --> 21:45.137
Yes.

21:45.137 --> 21:47.373
If I give you $300,000,

21:47.373 --> 21:49.074
I'm actually gonna
care about that.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.443
Like, that, you know,
I have to work for that,

21:51.443 --> 21:53.179
pay tax on it
and then give it to you.

21:53.179 --> 21:54.580
I don't want to lose it.

21:54.580 --> 21:56.448
Our interests will be aligned.

21:56.448 --> 21:58.484
You know, I don't think
that we'd be interested

21:58.484 --> 22:00.019
in the royalty piece.

22:00.019 --> 22:01.987
We want to keep all the money
in the business.

22:01.987 --> 22:03.556
Smart.
That's fair.

22:03.556 --> 22:06.091
So how would I ever get
my capital back?

22:06.091 --> 22:07.927
Well, you get it back
whenever we get it back--

22:07.927 --> 22:09.461
when there's an exit.

22:09.461 --> 22:11.197
Your money
Great answer.
at the same time.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.499
But you're asking me
to give you $300,000

22:13.499 --> 22:15.134
and then go work for you.

22:15.134 --> 22:16.202
I have a job.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.503
I'm really busy.

22:17.503 --> 22:19.205
I mean, that's basically
what you're saying.

22:19.205 --> 22:21.040
You guys are
allowed to counter

22:21.040 --> 22:22.174
or you can decline.

22:22.174 --> 22:24.476
Would you do...

22:26.679 --> 22:29.548
...$300,000...

22:29.548 --> 22:30.883
and, I'm sorry...
It's all good.

22:30.883 --> 22:32.451
...$300,000 for 8%?

22:32.451 --> 22:34.353
And if you can tell me
what that valuation is,

22:34.353 --> 22:35.621
that would be...

22:35.621 --> 22:37.790
No, if there's no royalty
return of capital on this,

22:37.790 --> 22:39.892
and I have to do
all the work to sell it,

22:39.892 --> 22:41.227
I'm not gonna do the deal.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.661
You should know that.

22:42.661 --> 22:43.662
Right.

22:43.662 --> 22:46.198
Well, we appreciate
the offer,

22:46.198 --> 22:48.300
but the royalty is something
that we just can't do.

22:48.300 --> 22:49.969
and understand it.
And I respect

22:49.969 --> 22:52.204
Way to stand your ground,
guys. It's a great company.

22:52.204 --> 22:53.239
Thank you.
Nothing wrong with that.

22:53.239 --> 22:54.907
Good luck, guys.
Thanks, guys.

22:54.907 --> 22:58.377
Congrats, guys.
Well done.
Thank you.
Lisa and Randall:

22:58.377 --> 23:00.045
Bye. Bye.

23:02.281 --> 23:04.550
We literally have put
everything we had

23:04.550 --> 23:05.751
into this company.

23:05.751 --> 23:08.587
You know,
we drained our life savings,

23:08.587 --> 23:10.689
we tapped into
our 401(k)'s.

23:10.689 --> 23:13.626
We have put everything we had
into this company,

23:13.626 --> 23:14.960
and we will continue
to do that

23:14.960 --> 23:17.363
because it means
that much to us.

23:17.363 --> 23:19.064
It is our third child,

23:19.064 --> 23:22.701
and we're gonna take it
above and beyond.

23:34.813 --> 23:36.015
Next into the Tank

23:36.015 --> 23:38.217
hoping to wrap up a deal
is a couple

23:38.217 --> 23:40.853
calorie superfood.
for their low

23:49.361 --> 23:51.196
Hi, Sharks.
My name is Xin Wang.

23:51.196 --> 23:52.798
And my name's
Melissa Colella-Wang,

23:52.798 --> 23:53.966
and we're from New York,

23:53.966 --> 23:57.436
3% equity of our company.
seeking $300,000 for

23:57.436 --> 24:00.439
Sharks, let's talk
about something important--

24:00.439 --> 24:01.440
tacos.

24:01.440 --> 24:02.608
Everyone loves tacos,

24:02.608 --> 24:05.177
but my doctors say
I can't eat tacos every day.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.746
That's 'cause of
the calorie-laden tortilla.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.215
And switching
to lettuce wraps?
Uh, no.

24:10.215 --> 24:11.817
They break apart
whenever you pick them up

24:11.817 --> 24:13.619
and they just
don't taste great.

24:13.619 --> 24:15.020
that combined
If only there was something

24:15.020 --> 24:16.755
of a lettuce wrap
the nutritional benefit

24:16.755 --> 24:18.991
of a traditional tortilla.
and the functionality

24:18.991 --> 24:20.592
Well, now there is.
Say hello to...

24:20.592 --> 24:22.027
Jica wraps! Jica wraps!

24:22.027 --> 24:23.929
A crisp and refreshing
tortilla alternative

24:23.929 --> 24:26.365
of fresh jicama.
made from thin slices

24:26.365 --> 24:28.167
Jica what?!

24:28.167 --> 24:30.436
Oh!
Jica yeah!

24:30.436 --> 24:33.872
Hey! It's Jicaman, a member
of the League of Superfoods!

24:33.872 --> 24:35.674
Jicama's
our hero ingredient

24:35.674 --> 24:37.509
'cause it truly is
a superfood.

24:37.509 --> 24:39.545
It's super low calorie...

24:39.545 --> 24:41.380
...super low carb...

24:41.380 --> 24:43.615
...super high fiber...

24:43.615 --> 24:46.085
...and one of its superpowers
is improving gut health.

24:46.085 --> 24:48.854
Ooh!
Jica yeah!

24:48.854 --> 24:50.122
Compared to a tortilla,

24:50.122 --> 24:52.124
which contains
100 calories and 15 carbs,

24:52.124 --> 24:54.159
our wraps
are only eight calories

24:54.159 --> 24:55.494
and one net carb per wrap.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.329
Use them to "skinny"
any taco.

24:57.329 --> 24:59.264
round and pliable,
Plus, they're perfectly

24:59.264 --> 25:01.667
and their neutral taste pairs
well with any recipe.

25:01.667 --> 25:04.236
paleo, keto,
So whether you're gluten-free,

25:04.236 --> 25:06.705
Whole30, or just looking
for a healthier way

25:06.705 --> 25:09.208
to make every day
Taco Tuesday...

25:09.208 --> 25:11.276
...you can say
"See ya, tortilla."

25:11.276 --> 25:13.779
"Lettuce do better with...

25:13.779 --> 25:14.847
Jica wraps!"

25:14.847 --> 25:16.382
Jica yeah!

25:16.382 --> 25:18.717
Come on, Sharks,
and join the jica mania.

25:19.818 --> 25:22.121
Jica what?!
Jica what?!

25:22.121 --> 25:23.622
So you guys
have got samples

25:23.622 --> 25:24.890
of our Jicama Tacos,

25:24.890 --> 25:26.258
you've got samples
of our Jicama Sticks

25:26.258 --> 25:28.861
with cilantro-lime seasoning,
and our Jica de Gallo.

25:28.861 --> 25:32.264
pico de gallo with jicama in
The Jica de Gallo is our it.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.966
without the stuffing?
Can I get one

25:33.966 --> 25:36.402
I just want to taste
the actual tortilla.

25:36.402 --> 25:38.070
jicama before?
Have you never had

25:38.070 --> 25:40.539
very pleasant-tasting...
It's like a watery,
I have not had it before.

25:40.539 --> 25:42.341
...slightly sweet root.

25:42.341 --> 25:46.178
I actually have jicama taco
recipes in my last cookbook.

25:46.178 --> 25:47.546
Oh, you do?

25:47.546 --> 25:49.681
How much do you sell it for?
What does it cost to make?

25:49.681 --> 25:52.384
So, we make it
for $1.85.

25:52.384 --> 25:56.388
$2.99, and it's on shelf for
We sell it to retail for
$4.99.

25:56.388 --> 25:58.123
And how many do I get
in that package?

25:58.123 --> 26:00.292
So you have about
15 wraps per package.

26:00.292 --> 26:02.261
about $0.30.
Each wrap is actually

26:02.261 --> 26:05.164
a regular tortilla like this.
You're gonna pay $0.28 for

26:05.164 --> 26:07.399
like a cassava
And a grain-free tortilla

26:07.399 --> 26:09.401
or an almond-flour tortilla,
you're paying over a dollar

26:09.401 --> 26:11.370
a lot of times
for that kind of a tortilla.

26:11.370 --> 26:12.805
So it's very
reasonably priced.

26:12.805 --> 26:16.208
I see, as a trend
in the wellness world,

26:16.208 --> 26:18.477
a huge thing.
grain-free is becoming

26:18.477 --> 26:19.845
First, it was gluten-free

26:19.845 --> 26:22.214
and now it's, like,
full on grain-free.

26:22.214 --> 26:24.716
So people are not even
having rice or quinoa.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.086
this category.
They're really moving into

26:27.086 --> 26:30.689
getting traction, for sure.
So I understand why it's

26:30.689 --> 26:33.759
Hey, are you making any money?
Do you have any profits?

26:33.759 --> 26:36.328
So, we started the company
in 2015,

26:36.328 --> 26:38.163
and we launched
with a different product.

26:38.163 --> 26:39.465
It was a jicama chip.

26:39.465 --> 26:42.267
And that jicama chip,
we got to $500,000 in sales.

26:42.267 --> 26:45.704
The issue was, we were
competing in the salty-snacks
category,

26:45.704 --> 26:47.873
and we were competing
with large giants,

26:47.873 --> 26:49.475
and we were losing
so much money.

26:49.475 --> 26:50.576
We got to the point

26:50.576 --> 26:52.678
where we only had $300
in our bank account

26:52.678 --> 26:54.913
and $70,000
in credit-card debt.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.682
We literally
Airbnb'ed our house

26:56.682 --> 26:57.883
just to survive.
Oh, my gosh.

26:57.883 --> 26:59.952
We sold our car.
We sold everything.

26:59.952 --> 27:01.587
So we pivoted in 2019

27:01.587 --> 27:04.289
from our jicama chips
to fresh-cut jicama.

27:04.289 --> 27:07.659
So in 2019, just one year
sales, $1 million.

27:07.659 --> 27:08.861
Wow!

27:08.861 --> 27:10.329
2020, $4 million. Wow.

27:10.329 --> 27:12.564
2021, $5 million.
What?!

27:12.564 --> 27:14.366
This year,
we're doing $6 million.

27:14.366 --> 27:15.501
Wow. Okay.

27:15.501 --> 27:16.869
This year,
in terms of profits,

27:16.869 --> 27:19.404
about $400,000,
about the same as last year.

27:19.404 --> 27:21.006
down this year
Our profits are a little

27:21.006 --> 27:23.575
because we've been putting
a lot of our money and resources

27:23.575 --> 27:26.945
into actually building our
own self-manufacturing
capacity.

27:26.945 --> 27:28.514
Where are you
manufacturing?

27:28.514 --> 27:33.018
The jicama products are
processed and sourced in Mexico.

27:33.018 --> 27:34.419
Mexico's actually
the only country

27:34.419 --> 27:36.188
that grows jicama commercially.

27:36.188 --> 27:37.756
So we like to put
our manufacturing

27:37.756 --> 27:38.957
very close to the source.

27:38.957 --> 27:40.959
And how long
does it stay fresh?

27:40.959 --> 27:44.296
I mean, they package it
in Mexico and ship it?

27:44.296 --> 27:45.964
is 19 days,
Yeah, so, our shelf life

27:45.964 --> 27:47.933
which is actually
2 to 3 times

27:47.933 --> 27:50.202
processors
what normal, fresh-cut

27:50.202 --> 27:51.370
will get on Jicama

27:51.370 --> 27:53.172
optimized the packaging
because we've really

27:53.172 --> 27:54.706
to extend that shelf life.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.742
What national retailers
are you in, or grocers?

27:56.742 --> 27:59.511
Some of the retailers that
we're in are Whole Foods, Sprouts,

27:59.511 --> 28:00.879
and we actually have
a big push

28:00.879 --> 28:02.381
into food services
here with Sysco.

28:02.381 --> 28:03.448
We're actually
being pushed into

28:03.448 --> 28:04.750
all of their
distribution centers.

28:04.750 --> 28:06.618
So that's a great thing
for food services.

28:06.618 --> 28:08.187
So how many stores
are you in?

28:08.187 --> 28:09.788
We're in about 700 doors.

28:09.788 --> 28:12.524
And that leads to
$6 million in sales?

28:12.524 --> 28:13.692
They're very popular.

28:13.692 --> 28:14.993
Yes.
O'Leary:
Can I ask you a question?

28:14.993 --> 28:17.229
$300,000 for 3%.

28:17.229 --> 28:20.032
to $10 million valuation.
I think that imputes

28:20.032 --> 28:22.701
You're gonna make
$400,000.

28:22.701 --> 28:26.238
You're asking for
a 25 multiple.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.706
The stock market, currently,

28:27.706 --> 28:31.643
the entire S&P trillion-dollar
market capitalization,

28:31.643 --> 28:33.545
trades at 17.5.

28:33.545 --> 28:36.481
Who is going to pay you
25x for this?

28:36.481 --> 28:38.250
let's be realistic.
Well, I mean,

28:38.250 --> 28:39.685
Well, we did
come in here

28:39.685 --> 28:41.019
asking for
two times our sales.

28:41.019 --> 28:42.788
So, actually, this year
we're gonna do $6 million,

28:42.788 --> 28:44.089
next year we're gonna do
$9 million.

28:44.089 --> 28:45.857
Yeah, but at the end of the
day, it's what you make,

28:45.857 --> 28:48.527
and you're making thin margins
in a food category.

28:48.527 --> 28:51.196
No one is gonna do
this deal at 3%--

28:51.196 --> 28:53.198
not here, not anywhere.

28:53.198 --> 28:55.067
Well, we'd love to hear
some offers from you guys.

28:55.067 --> 28:56.501
If you want to increase
the percentage,

28:56.501 --> 28:59.037
we're more than ha--
I'll start with an offer.

28:59.037 --> 29:00.372
Sure.
All right.

29:00.372 --> 29:03.875
$300,000 for 10%,
I'll give you

29:03.875 --> 29:06.678
but I'd like a pro rata share
of what you earn from a business.

29:06.678 --> 29:10.816
Okay.
So, therefore,
if you're taking out $90,

29:10.816 --> 29:13.719
you're handing me $10.
Okay.

29:13.719 --> 29:15.420
I'll save you some time.
Look, I'm--

29:15.420 --> 29:16.855
The jicama's good
'cause I'm starving.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.057
I'm not a huge jicama fan.

29:19.057 --> 29:20.425
So for those reasons,
I'm out.

29:20.425 --> 29:22.661
Okay, thank you
so much, Mark.
Got it. Thank you, Mark.

29:22.661 --> 29:24.096
I'm gonna follow Mark
on this one.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.932
I love you, Jicama man.
I-I'm sorry.

29:26.932 --> 29:28.467
You're adorable.

29:28.467 --> 29:30.502
The product is fantastic.
I love jicama.

29:30.502 --> 29:34.106
But for me, I make this
myself at home, so...

29:34.106 --> 29:37.276
You buy the whole jicama,
you peel it, you use it. Right.

29:37.276 --> 29:39.077
So, for that reason, I'm out.

29:40.345 --> 29:42.814
I like what you're doing.
I like jicama.

29:42.814 --> 29:45.617
completely in the right space
I believe that you are

29:45.617 --> 29:47.919
doing the right thing.
at the right time,

29:47.919 --> 29:49.521
I think it's a great business
for you.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.356
the right business for me.
I don't think it's

29:51.356 --> 29:52.724
I wish you good luck,
but I'm out.

29:52.724 --> 29:54.726
Okay, thank you, Lori.

29:54.726 --> 29:58.764
You're killing Jicama Man
over here.
Aw, Jicama Man.

29:58.764 --> 30:00.632
You know, you have an offer
from Barbara.

30:00.632 --> 30:01.900
What do you think of it?

30:01.900 --> 30:05.537
percentage, um, are you
So, in terms of the willing

30:05.537 --> 30:11.143
to do, uh, the $300,000
for, um...

30:11.143 --> 30:12.377
do it at 5%?

30:12.377 --> 30:13.679
No, I wouldn't.

30:13.679 --> 30:15.580
I would have to
stay with the 10%.

30:15.580 --> 30:16.815
I'll do it for 9%,

30:16.815 --> 30:19.017
just to make it interesting
for Barbara.

30:19.017 --> 30:20.686
And then you get
Chef Wonderful.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.689
Just squeezing her jicama
a little bit. Okay.

30:23.689 --> 30:26.258
And pro rata deal
for Kevin, as well.
Oh, absolutely.

30:26.258 --> 30:28.560
Otherwise, you'll never get
your capital back.

30:28.560 --> 30:31.463
Are you guys willing to do,
uh, 7%?

30:31.463 --> 30:33.398
Definitely not.
Not for me, no.

30:33.398 --> 30:34.900
O'Leary: I've pointed out
what you've done.

30:34.900 --> 30:37.035
You valued your business at
an extraordinary multiple.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.705
I'm a financial services guy.
I'm a multiple guy,

30:39.705 --> 30:41.373
private-equity deals.
I do a lot of

30:41.373 --> 30:43.342
You would not get that deal
in the world today.

30:43.342 --> 30:44.643
Other than the money,

30:44.643 --> 30:47.112
what is it you're looking for
in a Shark partner?

30:47.112 --> 30:50.148
As we mentioned before, we
have the manufacturing set up,

30:50.148 --> 30:52.050
but we need help
in sales and marketing.

30:52.050 --> 30:53.552
I can open up the doors
of grocery

30:53.552 --> 30:55.253
because I have so many
other products in there.

30:55.253 --> 30:57.723
He's honestly...
But she's talking her book.

30:57.723 --> 30:59.858
I know what I do
well. I do sales and marketing.

30:59.858 --> 31:02.594
That's how I became rich
in the first place.

31:02.594 --> 31:04.529
I know it better
than anyone else.

31:04.529 --> 31:06.932
the same social marketing
I can certainly deliver

31:06.932 --> 31:09.167
as Mr. Wonderful, who thinks
he's much more wonderful

31:09.167 --> 31:11.002
than he actually is.

31:11.002 --> 31:13.572
Because he's
Oh!
an overstater.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.941
O'Leary: You want the truth?
The only reason she's here

31:15.941 --> 31:18.276
a new broom this year.
is I bought her

31:18.276 --> 31:21.513
And I'm gonna tell him where
to shove that broom any minute.

31:21.513 --> 31:22.614
You guys have to
make a decision.

31:22.614 --> 31:23.815
You got two offers.

31:23.815 --> 31:27.486
$300,000 for 6%
Barbara, would you consider

31:27.486 --> 31:29.955
and then 2%
in advisory shares?

31:29.955 --> 31:32.557
Well, how about one more
percent in advisory shares?

31:32.557 --> 31:35.293
Total of 9%.
3% in advisory shares.

31:35.293 --> 31:37.729
Yes, I would, actually,
just to beat him out. Okay.

31:43.001 --> 31:44.436
What would you guys
like to do?

31:44.436 --> 31:47.572
So, Barbara...
you've got a deal.

31:47.572 --> 31:49.674
Congrats, guys.
Thank you very much.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.476
That's smart.
Really smart move.
Good deal.

31:51.476 --> 31:53.612
Congrats, Barb.
Thank you very much.

31:53.612 --> 31:55.614
by the way.
You're terrific together,
Thank you.

31:55.614 --> 31:57.082
Get rid of this bozo, though.

31:57.082 --> 31:58.550
Yeah!

31:58.550 --> 32:00.218
Jica yeah!

32:02.854 --> 32:04.356
with Barbara.
We made a deal

32:04.356 --> 32:06.558
I can't believe--
This is insane!

32:06.558 --> 32:09.461
I mean, we've been watching
"Shark Tank" forever now, so...

32:11.797 --> 32:13.131
Dream of our lifetime.

32:23.041 --> 32:24.643
like each other?
Do you guys

32:24.643 --> 32:26.144
No, I hate all of them.
Very much do. Yeah.

32:26.144 --> 32:28.880
No, I'm kidding.
You do?

32:32.350 --> 32:34.486
Next up is
an eco-friendly version

32:34.486 --> 32:36.888
of one of the world's
biggest polluters.

32:44.763 --> 32:48.133
My name is Amrita Saigal,
Hi, Sharks.

32:48.133 --> 32:51.136
Los Angeles, California.
and I am from

32:51.136 --> 32:57.509
for 5% equity in my company,
I'm seeking $250,000

32:57.509 --> 32:59.044
Kudos.

32:59.044 --> 33:02.314
So, Sharks, this may seem
a little odd to you,

33:02.314 --> 33:04.249
being wrapped in plastic,

33:04.249 --> 33:08.320
disposable diapers are made
but this is what most of,

33:08.320 --> 33:12.357
meaning most babies spend two
to three years of their lives

33:12.357 --> 33:16.394
wrapped in plastic,
not letting their butts breathe,

33:16.394 --> 33:18.029
and not to mention,

33:18.029 --> 33:22.501
diapers are the third-largest
consumer item in landfills.

33:22.501 --> 33:26.304
So we decided to diaper
the world differently

33:26.304 --> 33:27.906
with Kudos.

33:27.906 --> 33:30.742
Kudos are premium
disposable diapers

33:30.742 --> 33:32.978
where baby's sensitive tush

33:32.978 --> 33:37.916
touches 100% soft, natural
cotton all day--

33:37.916 --> 33:40.218
not plastic.

33:40.218 --> 33:43.822
Cotton is the number-one
doctor-recommended material

33:43.822 --> 33:45.924
for rash and eczema.

33:45.924 --> 33:49.761
it's natural, chlorine free,
Our customers love that

33:49.761 --> 33:52.664
and far more sustainable.

33:52.664 --> 33:56.902
And these are natural diapers
that actually work!

33:56.902 --> 34:00.338
Our team of MIT engineers
developed award-winning,

34:00.338 --> 34:03.575
double-dry technology
patent-pending,

34:03.575 --> 34:06.344
absorption layers
that uses two

34:06.344 --> 34:11.483
instead of just one to avoid
those leaks and blowouts

34:11.483 --> 34:15.587
and keep your baby
sleeping all night long.

34:15.587 --> 34:18.924
So, Sharks, who's in to
help change the world with us

34:18.924 --> 34:21.092
one tush at a time?

34:21.092 --> 34:22.294
So, in front of you,

34:22.294 --> 34:25.096
you each have
an individual pack of diapers.

34:25.096 --> 34:28.266
The first thing you might
notice about them is how soft
they are.

34:28.266 --> 34:30.936
our customers love about them.
And this is something

34:30.936 --> 34:33.905
So very soft, like,
if I'm comparing, right?
Yeah.

34:33.905 --> 34:35.340
the plasticky feel.
Doesn't have

34:35.340 --> 34:37.142
Obviously there's something
on the outside here

34:37.142 --> 34:38.476
that keeps it leakproof. Yeah.

34:38.476 --> 34:40.111
Not super thick. Correct.

34:40.111 --> 34:42.914
your average diaper, for sure.
I think this is thinner than Yep.

34:42.914 --> 34:45.116
Will you tell us a little
about your background?

34:45.116 --> 34:49.354
So, I come from a family
of all engineers.

34:49.354 --> 34:51.356
I was fortunate to go to MIT,

34:51.356 --> 34:53.291
in mechanical engineering,
where I majored

34:53.291 --> 34:55.727
and I later went to Harvard
to get my MBA.

34:55.727 --> 34:58.029
I got my dream job
out of college,

34:58.029 --> 35:01.366
engineer for Procter & Gamble.
working as a manufacturing

35:01.366 --> 35:05.003
And I saw firsthand
just how much plastic

35:05.003 --> 35:08.173
sanitary pads and diapers.
we were putting into

35:08.173 --> 35:10.609
to take a huge risk.
So I decided

35:10.609 --> 35:14.546
I decided to quit my stable
job and move to India

35:14.546 --> 35:16.247
and start my first company there,

35:16.247 --> 35:18.917
making biodegradable
sanitary pads

35:18.917 --> 35:20.819
banana-tree fiber,
out of waste

35:20.819 --> 35:22.087
and that has grown to become

35:22.087 --> 35:24.923
eco-friendly brands there.
one of the leading

35:24.923 --> 35:27.726
I transitioned out of that,
moved back to the US,

35:27.726 --> 35:29.461
and as I entered
my early 30s,

35:29.461 --> 35:33.064
my first wave of friends
started having babies,

35:33.064 --> 35:35.333
and I knew we could do better
with diapers, as well.

35:35.333 --> 35:39.704
Do you have a baby at this
time, or just for your
friends? No. No.
Um, yeah, no baby.

35:39.704 --> 35:42.674
I actually am now a new mom
with a 12-week-old at home.

35:42.674 --> 35:44.643
Congrats.
Ah.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.613
There's a picture of her right
here where she is wearing Kudos

35:48.613 --> 35:50.281
and has been testing them
every day.

35:50.281 --> 35:51.716
Kind of wild.

35:51.716 --> 35:54.719
I actually got the call for--
from the producers

35:54.719 --> 35:56.354
for "Shark Tank" when I was
in the delivery room,

35:56.354 --> 35:58.690
and I was like,
"Oh, my God!
That's crazy.

35:58.690 --> 36:00.592
How is this all gonna happen
in the next couple of weeks?"

36:00.592 --> 36:02.894
That's a very
special day, then, huh?

36:02.894 --> 36:04.195
A lot of new beginnings.

36:04.195 --> 36:06.498
But, like, as a new mom,
this is even more personal.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.867
I want the cleanest
and safest ingredients

36:08.867 --> 36:10.468
touching her-- her skin.

36:10.468 --> 36:12.170
And what are your sales?

36:12.170 --> 36:13.838
So, we launched a year ago.

36:13.838 --> 36:16.608
we have done $850,000 in
In this first year, sales.

36:16.608 --> 36:18.343
That's pretty good.
It's very good.

36:18.343 --> 36:20.245
O'Leary: And how have you
sold-- direct to consumer

36:20.245 --> 36:21.713
or you're going through
retail distribution?

36:21.713 --> 36:24.115
We are-- been 100%
direct to consumer.

36:24.115 --> 36:26.051
Have you bootstrapped
this whole thing?

36:26.051 --> 36:27.185
We have not.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.287
We have raised $3.2 million.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.655
Dang!
Wow.

36:30.655 --> 36:31.956
O'Leary: And what valuation?

36:31.956 --> 36:34.926
Our last valuation
was $12.5 million.

36:34.926 --> 36:37.529
I'm assuming you're
not profitable.
We are not profitable.

36:37.529 --> 36:39.898
What are your aggregate losses
since you started this?

36:39.898 --> 36:42.067
Since we've started,
$1.5 million.

36:42.067 --> 36:44.969
That being said, we do expect
to become profitable next year.

36:44.969 --> 36:48.239
$4.5 million sales next year.
We do expect to do

36:48.239 --> 36:51.109
How much are the diapers?
We have two options.

36:51.109 --> 36:53.311
a one-time purchase for $88
You can make

36:53.311 --> 36:56.815
or join our subscription
for $78 a month.

36:56.815 --> 37:00.385
Each box of diapers we sell is
a one-month supply of diapers.

37:00.385 --> 37:01.686
How does your product price

37:01.686 --> 37:03.855
compared to the general market
out there?

37:03.855 --> 37:06.691
So, in the eco-friendly space,

37:06.691 --> 37:09.294
we are very much
on par with them.

37:09.294 --> 37:11.663
Are the eco-friendly
category of diapers

37:11.663 --> 37:14.833
about twice as expensive
as the rest of the diapers?
Not twice as expensive.

37:14.833 --> 37:17.635
I would say it's
anywhere from 20% to 50%.

37:17.635 --> 37:19.137
And what is your margin
on the diapers?

37:19.137 --> 37:23.041
is $39.
So, landed at our warehouse

37:23.041 --> 37:25.710
That's not a lot of margin for
a direct-to-consumer business.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.747
for the diaper industry,
And the reality is,

37:28.747 --> 37:30.148
it's very, very typical.

37:30.148 --> 37:32.450
No, I'm not saying this,
but you're direct to consumer.

37:32.450 --> 37:34.119
How much do you spend
on marketing?

37:34.119 --> 37:38.056
$100,000 in marketing in our
We have spent less than
first year.

37:38.056 --> 37:41.226
of customer acquisition
Our blended cost

37:41.226 --> 37:43.661
which we're really proud of.
has been $23,

37:43.661 --> 37:45.864
has been huge for us.
Word of mouth

37:45.864 --> 37:48.233
So where do you see yourself
in five years?

37:48.233 --> 37:51.035
I really think of baby diapers
as just the beginning.

37:51.035 --> 37:54.038
We just launched with baby
wipes three weeks ago.

37:54.038 --> 37:56.508
we expect to be launching
And then, additionally,

37:56.508 --> 37:58.309
with training pants
and swim pants.

37:58.309 --> 37:59.444
That's just the beginning.

37:59.444 --> 38:01.513
Then where I really
see us going, Mark,

38:01.513 --> 38:03.081
is the adult diaper market.

38:03.081 --> 38:05.316
you could be a customer.
So, Kevin,

38:05.316 --> 38:09.087
It is a booming market.
Listen, I'd like to wear a
pair with the Mavs logo on it.

38:10.822 --> 38:12.757
This is
a very mature market.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.326
You worked at the largest
player in this space.
I did.

38:15.326 --> 38:17.462
There was
a behemoth brand there. Yeah.

38:17.462 --> 38:20.198
Do you really think,
after you get, let's say,

38:20.198 --> 38:22.467
4% or 5% share of the market,

38:22.467 --> 38:23.968
they're not gonna
wake up and say

38:23.968 --> 38:26.237
"We need
an eco-friendly diaper"?

38:26.237 --> 38:27.772
And I know you've said
it's very hard to do--

38:27.772 --> 38:29.340
Kevin, if they get 4%--

38:29.340 --> 38:32.410
if she gets 4% or 5%,
she doesn't care.

38:32.410 --> 38:35.146
the numbers into perspective,
Kevin, just to put

38:35.146 --> 38:40.084
0.01% of the market would be
$7 million in sales.

38:40.084 --> 38:41.753
But these
big incumbents,

38:41.753 --> 38:43.688
they cannot build brands
themselves in-house.

38:43.688 --> 38:45.156
You see it all the time.

38:45.156 --> 38:47.425
companies are--
I mean, big soft-drink

38:47.425 --> 38:49.460
Gwyneth, the only way
you get out--
an authentic brand.
They can't develop

38:49.460 --> 38:52.230
So anyway, let me--
while they're arguing, right?

38:52.230 --> 38:53.631
What are you missing?

38:53.631 --> 38:54.966
In terms of what?

38:54.966 --> 38:56.935
What are you
looking for?
We need to figure out

38:56.935 --> 38:58.603
how to make this product
a household name.

38:58.603 --> 39:00.038
We know we have
a better product,

39:00.038 --> 39:01.272
we know parents love it.

39:01.272 --> 39:04.042
We need to expand into
other online retailers.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.744
We know the goop audience
is very, very aligned with--

39:06.744 --> 39:08.646
has shared values in--

39:08.646 --> 39:10.982
Gwyneth. Gwyneth, is this
something you like?

39:24.696 --> 39:26.731
All Sharks
are still in,

39:26.731 --> 39:28.700
and Mark has asked Gwyneth
if she's interested

39:28.700 --> 39:31.269
in Amrita's eco-friendly
diaper brand, Kudos.

39:31.269 --> 39:32.670
Gwyneth, is this
something you like?

39:32.670 --> 39:33.872
I like it.

39:33.872 --> 39:35.573
about what you're doing.
I am very excited

39:35.573 --> 39:38.142
white space in the market.
I do see a really big

39:38.142 --> 39:40.445
I was using eco diapers
When I had babies,

39:40.445 --> 39:43.047
Yeah.
and had a mustard explosion.

39:43.047 --> 39:47.352
So, I-- if it's true that
these really function the way

39:47.352 --> 39:48.753
that you're saying
that they function,

39:48.753 --> 39:50.154
I mean, this is--

39:50.154 --> 39:52.056
a huge opportunity here.
I think you have
Yep. 100%.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.658
I do too.

39:53.658 --> 39:55.093
Do you want to do
something together?

39:55.093 --> 39:57.962
Yeah.
...whether it's
mastering your--

39:57.962 --> 39:59.464
moments, and I've felt that--
There are a lot of tough

39:59.464 --> 40:01.099
You know what? We're gonna
try to save you some time.

40:01.099 --> 40:02.467
Right?
Okay. Okay.

40:02.467 --> 40:05.870
So, I'd like to make an offer
with Gwyneth, right?

40:05.870 --> 40:09.807
And you're gonna need money,
but this is a starting point.

40:09.807 --> 40:12.377
You asked for 250K for 5%.
Yeah.

40:12.377 --> 40:14.679
I'm thinking 12%, Gwyneth.
Does that work for you?

40:14.679 --> 40:16.447
Perfect.
That works for me.

40:16.447 --> 40:18.983
We'll offer you
the 250K for 12%.

40:20.385 --> 40:21.920
But you'll have
both of us.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.755
All the online retailers
are easy.

40:23.755 --> 40:25.757
Obviously, Gwyneth
is a superstar.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.660
We've got products
in every retail organization,

40:28.660 --> 40:30.061
so I think we can
get you there.

40:30.061 --> 40:32.263
So now it's up to you.
What do you want to do?

40:32.263 --> 40:34.933
Okay. Could-- That's--

40:34.933 --> 40:37.602
than I wa-- that I wanted to
That's a little more--

40:37.602 --> 40:39.704
Welcome to the Shark Tank.
O'Leary: Welcome to
the Shark Tank.

40:39.704 --> 40:41.506
What do you think
happens in here?

40:41.506 --> 40:42.907
You can counter.
You can counter.

40:42.907 --> 40:44.809
the value a Shark brings.
I completely understand

40:44.809 --> 40:46.210
Two Sharks.
I 100% understand that.

40:46.210 --> 40:47.979
And I am so thankful.
Two Sharks.

40:47.979 --> 40:49.914
With complementary
skill sets.

40:49.914 --> 40:53.284
I understand all of that.
So, first of all, thank you.

40:53.284 --> 41:00.224
Could I counter that
for $250,000 for...

41:00.224 --> 41:02.560
8%, 4% each?

41:02.560 --> 41:03.895
Would you be willing
to do that?

41:03.895 --> 41:05.596
Make it 10%?

41:05.596 --> 41:06.898
I'd be good with 10%.

41:06.898 --> 41:09.767
10% and you got it.
We'll split the difference.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.669
And they could
be advisory shares.

41:11.669 --> 41:15.707
Could we do 3% advisory shares
Okay. Okay.

41:15.707 --> 41:18.242
and then split the 7%
between the two of you?

41:18.242 --> 41:20.011
That's the total of 10,
so that works.

41:21.546 --> 41:24.916
Oh, my God.
You got a deal!

41:24.916 --> 41:27.085
Congrats!

41:27.085 --> 41:28.353
This is honestly...
Oh, my God!

41:28.353 --> 41:29.687
This is gonna be amazing.
You're a star.

41:29.687 --> 41:30.855
...a dream come true!

41:30.855 --> 41:32.623
Congratulations,
and congrats on the baby.

41:32.623 --> 41:34.225
Oh, my God!

41:34.225 --> 41:36.661
This is literally a dream!

41:36.661 --> 41:38.429
It's exciting.
Thank you so much!

41:38.429 --> 41:39.630
Congratulations.

41:39.630 --> 41:40.865
Thanks. Thank you!

41:40.865 --> 41:42.200
Congrats.

41:44.535 --> 41:46.471
Oh, my God!

41:46.471 --> 41:49.140
Did that really just happen?!

41:49.140 --> 41:50.808
Ahhh!

41:50.808 --> 41:53.077
No one understands
the Kudos audience

41:53.077 --> 41:54.946
better than Gwyneth Paltrow.

41:54.946 --> 41:56.381
With her on board,

41:56.381 --> 41:59.517
we are going to have cotton
on every baby's butt

41:59.517 --> 42:01.452
as soon as possible.

42:01.452 --> 42:02.453
I think you're right, Gwyneth.

42:02.453 --> 42:03.521
I think this is a star.

42:03.521 --> 42:06.224
She's got a dynamic pedigree, obviously,

42:06.224 --> 42:08.092
with all the engineering.
Yeah, you got to bet on
a jockey like that.

42:08.092 --> 42:10.828
She's an engineer.
She went to HBS.

42:10.828 --> 42:12.764
I mean, she clearly has
a business mind,

42:12.764 --> 42:14.198
an engineer's mind. Yep.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.901
And I think that she's doing
something really important

42:16.901 --> 42:19.270
and really needed
in the market.
Mm-hmm.
100%. Yeah.

42:19.270 --> 42:22.140
She also has enough energy
for about five entrepreneurs.

42:22.140 --> 42:25.777
I was waiting for her
to spontaneously combust.
