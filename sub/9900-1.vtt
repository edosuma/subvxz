02:41.559 --> 02:44.459
- Twenty-five. I'll take it!
- How's July? July how?

02:44.461 --> 02:48.663
July's at 95 and a quarter.
At 95 and a quarter.

02:48.665 --> 02:51.265
Ninety-four and a half bid. Ninety-four
and a half bid. Hey, bonehead! Moron!

02:51.267 --> 02:53.267

- Sold, 300.

02:58.373 --> 03:00.639
Buy 300. Yes!

03:00.641 --> 03:04.842
Three hundred? Three hundred! You idiot!
Get out of my way!

03:08.414 --> 03:11.848
Three hundred lots of coffee futures?
You call that a hunch?

03:11.850 --> 03:15.518
No, Richard, I call that
an opportunity.

03:15.520 --> 03:19.188
Three hundred lots in this market is
not an opportunity. It's a death wish.

03:19.190 --> 03:23.325
- Oh, ye of little faith.
- No, no, no. Me of big mortgage.

03:23.327 --> 03:25.327
- Hi, maddy. Whaddya got?
- American flight 109,

03:25.329 --> 03:28.596
leaving jfk at 1:00 P.M.,
arriving caracas at 6:22 P.M.

03:28.598 --> 03:31.632
- All right, all right.
- Aw, come on. You're not still leaving, are ya?

03:31.634 --> 03:34.801
- After what you just did in there?
- I'm getting married to Charlotte in 30 days.

03:34.803 --> 03:37.537
In order to do that, I need
the divorce from Patricia.

03:37.539 --> 03:39.539
- Toiletries. Two shirts, two shorts, two socks.
- I don't believe this.

03:39.541 --> 03:42.708
You're gonna leave me
with 5,100 tons of coffee?

03:42.710 --> 03:45.577
Richard, the only reason I've
put up with you for so long...

03:45.579 --> 03:47.679
Is 'cause you're
the best analyst on the street.

03:47.681 --> 03:49.647
I... y-you know, you give me
that same patronizing...

03:49.649 --> 03:51.649
Little speech every time you
play one of your stupid hunches.

03:51.651 --> 03:53.684
- Yeah? And what happens?
- I'm hospitalized,

03:53.686 --> 03:55.652
and the blood pressure
medication is adjusted.

03:55.654 --> 03:58.321
Laptop, uplink.
You'll overnight in caracas,

03:58.323 --> 04:00.323
then fly to canaima the next
morning where you'll be met.

04:00.325 --> 04:02.325
Thanks. See ya in two days.

04:04.562 --> 04:07.462
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

04:21.444 --> 04:24.478
This thing might be quicker
if you used both engines!

04:24.480 --> 04:27.314
Senor cromwell?

04:27.316 --> 04:29.349
Ahh, senor cromwell.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.486
That would be me...
Michael cromwell with a "c."

04:34.488 --> 04:38.756
Senor cromwell with a "c," I am Abe
botero with a "b," your attorney-at-law.

04:38.758 --> 04:41.925
- I am outrageously pleased to meet with you.
- Mm-hmm.

04:41.927 --> 04:45.495
Okay. Abe... Abe, lemme go.

04:45.497 --> 04:48.431
My car is right over here.
Do you have any more luggage?

04:48.433 --> 04:52.435
I travel kinda light, Abe. So
what's the deal? Where is Patricia?

04:52.437 --> 04:56.038
Ahh, we received this letter
from your wife today.

04:56.040 --> 04:59.274
Senora cromwell says that
she could not come to canaima,

04:59.276 --> 05:01.393
but she wants us
to get you to lipo lipo.

05:01.394 --> 05:03.511
Wait a second. What are you talkin' about?
I travel 3,000 to get here,

05:03.513 --> 05:05.913
and she doesn't show up.
What's that about?

05:05.915 --> 05:08.749
Abe has a saying.

05:08.751 --> 05:11.618
He who knows what a woman wants
knows everything,

05:11.620 --> 05:14.621
but not even God knows that.

05:14.623 --> 05:18.958
Okay. If that's the way she wants to
play it, she's not gonna get a dime.

05:24.498 --> 05:30.334
If cromwell should bother to call, put
him through to my office immediately!

05:30.336 --> 05:35.405
Has anybody seen that idiot
kempster around here? Kempster!

05:35.407 --> 05:37.840
Michael, you have got
to get back here tomorrow.

05:37.842 --> 05:39.975
Langston is going insane.
Where are you?

05:39.977 --> 05:43.445
I'm staying in the middle
of "nightmare on bodega street."

05:43.447 --> 05:46.948
If... if you don't get here, do I
sell the coffee or do I hold it?

05:46.950 --> 05:50.618
No, no, no, no. Do not sell the
coffee till I give you the go-ahead.

05:50.620 --> 05:52.987
Call me on the uplink as soon
as London opens, all right?

05:52.989 --> 05:55.022
- All right. Okay.
- Kempster!

06:25.620 --> 06:27.686
No, no. I wouldn't do that.

06:27.688 --> 06:31.122
Oh, and why not?

07:01.654 --> 07:05.688
Lipo lipo.
So nice they named it twice.

07:08.592 --> 07:10.992
Oh, my God.

07:10.994 --> 07:13.661
She left me
for gilligan's island.

07:18.801 --> 07:20.834
Great. I'll be right back.

07:20.836 --> 07:23.036
Not long. I have an appointment.

07:23.038 --> 07:27.706
You have an appointment? Well, if it's
the cable guy, you got plenty of time.

07:27.708 --> 07:30.108
- Okay.
- Hi. Um...

07:30.110 --> 07:34.545
I-I'm... I'm Michael cromwell. I'm
looking for Patricia cromwell.

07:34.547 --> 07:39.782
You know, Patricia. Patricia cromwell?
She's a... uh, she's a doctor.

07:39.784 --> 07:42.518
No. No, a woman,
which would look like me,

07:42.520 --> 07:46.421
but, but, but full-figured.

07:46.423 --> 07:48.523
Paliku.

07:48.525 --> 07:50.791
- Paliku. Paliku. Paliku.
- Pali who?

07:50.793 --> 07:52.859
- Paliku. Pali...
- Pali...

07:52.861 --> 07:55.595
- paliku? Where is she?
- Paliku. Paliku.

07:55.597 --> 07:58.130
- Paliku. Paliku. Paliku.
- Yes, I heard you.

07:58.132 --> 08:00.732
- Paliku.
- Okay, okay.

08:05.772 --> 08:07.771
Patricia.

08:10.709 --> 08:13.710
You look different.

08:13.712 --> 08:16.512
Michael. You made it.

08:17.548 --> 08:20.181
Um, yes, I did.

08:29.725 --> 08:32.125
You look good.

08:32.126 --> 08:34.126
So do you.

08:34.129 --> 08:36.863
- How have you been?
- Better. Much better.

08:36.865 --> 08:39.664
Weren't you supposed to meet me
in canaima last night?

08:39.667 --> 08:41.967
Botako's having
her first litter.

08:41.969 --> 08:46.137
- Congratulations.
- Not her. This is pontspie. Pontspie...

08:51.243 --> 08:53.476
this is botako.

08:54.946 --> 08:57.846
Y-you know, as much as I hate
to spoil this joyous event...

08:57.848 --> 09:00.682
I took an airplane from New York City.
I have a boat waiting.

09:00.684 --> 09:03.184
You remember the divorce?
Patricia.

09:03.186 --> 09:06.053
- Patricia!
- Paliku.

09:06.055 --> 09:09.089
My pinare name is paliku.
We pick our own names here.

09:09.091 --> 09:11.991
Do you remember
12, 13 years ago maybe...

09:11.993 --> 09:17.196
When outta the blue... we weren't even
married a year... and you walked out on me.

09:17.198 --> 09:20.599
And now you want a divorce, and you
think I'm gonna hit you up for money.

09:20.601 --> 09:23.034
We both want a divorce.
And aren't you?

09:23.036 --> 09:27.805
- I don't want any money.
- Great! We can get to caracas right now.

09:27.807 --> 09:31.208
That way we can sign the divorce papers. I'd
be back in New York by, uh, Friday afternoon.

09:31.210 --> 09:34.810
Tomorrow's the <i> fanenteyou</i> celebration.
I have to be here.

09:36.747 --> 09:38.780
- Oh.
- It's a male!

09:40.950 --> 09:43.984
As much as I'd like to stick
around for the circumcision,

09:43.986 --> 09:46.785
I've got a canoe waiting, and
my boatman has an appointment.

09:50.524 --> 09:53.091
- Your boatman is gone.
- What?

09:53.093 --> 09:55.159
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait! Tell him to stop!

09:55.161 --> 09:57.261
<i>Hasta LA vista.</i>

09:57.263 --> 10:00.631
Hey, hey, hey! Stop!
You can't leave me here!

10:00.633 --> 10:02.933
What you're doing
is very unprofessional.

10:12.644 --> 10:15.144
Oh, no. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa!

10:15.146 --> 10:18.046
Come back here!
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

10:18.048 --> 10:21.649
I'm gonna need all these clothes back
right where they came from, all right?

10:22.585 --> 10:25.085
Aww, this is a braun.

10:26.688 --> 10:29.055
Wh... what about my boat?

10:29.057 --> 10:32.792
He'll be back, couple of days.

10:32.794 --> 10:36.629
- What am I supposed to do now?
- The chief says you can spend the night with the bachelors.

10:36.631 --> 10:39.965
- I'm not stayin' with the bachelors.
- Or pontspie offered her hut.

10:44.204 --> 10:46.204
Bring on the bachelors.

11:05.591 --> 11:07.624
Aw, come on. Come on.

11:07.626 --> 11:11.127
- Hungry?
- I am starving.

11:11.129 --> 11:13.929
- Oh.
- It's yellow-eared bat, a pinare specialty.

11:13.931 --> 11:16.731
- It's made from the bladder.
- Oh, bat bladder.

11:16.733 --> 11:18.999
Holy kaopectate.
I don't think so.

11:21.937 --> 11:23.937
- You might prefer the <i> Kara toka.</i>
- Yeah, right.

11:23.939 --> 11:26.306
- Chicken.
- Yeah, I would prefer that.

11:26.308 --> 11:30.343
Thanks. Okay. Okay.
I'm ready. Excuse me.

11:30.345 --> 11:32.378
- Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!
- Michael.

11:32.380 --> 11:34.880
Michael, there's something that
I have to talk to you about.

11:34.882 --> 11:38.283
- Patricia, let's not, okay?
- Well, there's something that you don't know.

11:38.285 --> 11:40.852
Oh, yeah? Like why you left me.

11:40.854 --> 11:44.889
I left you because
of the fifth phone line.

11:44.891 --> 11:47.391
- What is that supposed to mean?
- One morning some guy...

11:47.393 --> 11:50.160
Showed up at our apartment
to install a fifth phone line.

11:50.162 --> 11:52.629
He asked if I was
the receptionist.

11:52.631 --> 11:55.031
And I realized
that I had lost you somehow.

11:55.033 --> 11:59.101
So I packed my things, and I left you
alone. I figured you'd be happier that way.

11:59.103 --> 12:02.304
- You thought this would make me happy?
- How long before you noticed I was gone?

12:02.306 --> 12:06.775
Why didn't you talk to me? -Talk to you? I
spent six months telling you I was unhappy.

12:06.777 --> 12:09.110
It was a crazy time for me. I'd
just started working at l.T.G.

12:09.112 --> 12:11.412
- I had a straddled position in sugar. The price went up.
- Michael.

12:11.414 --> 12:14.715
- It skyrocketed. I'm short in...
- Michael. Michael!

12:14.716 --> 12:18.017
- What?
- It's very hard for me to tell you this, so please listen.

12:18.020 --> 12:21.287
Well, what choice do I have? I'm stuck
here with you and the village people...

12:21.289 --> 12:23.956
Till you celebrate
banana-fana fo-fana.

12:23.958 --> 12:26.325
<i>Hello, you.</i>

12:28.162 --> 12:31.229
Excuse me. The real world calls.

12:32.332 --> 12:34.932
<i>Hello, you.</i>

12:43.742 --> 12:46.776
- What I'm trying to say is that...
- Look, I was right.

12:46.778 --> 12:48.778
- I wasn't exactly alone when I left.
- I was right. I was right.

12:48.780 --> 12:51.531
- Ninety-seven and a quarter?
- Michael.

12:51.532 --> 12:54.283
- I guess... I'm... I'm with ya. Coffee has gone crazy.
- Michael.

12:54.285 --> 12:57.002
- I didn't know it at the time, but I was...
- 97 and a quarter. 97... 97 and a quarter.

12:57.003 --> 12:59.720
Am I greedy? I'm feelin' pretty greedy. I'm s...
I'm gonna wait till... -...Pregnant with your son.

12:59.723 --> 13:01.889
97 and a half,
'cause it's gonna happen.

13:01.891 --> 13:04.124
Waitin'. Papa is waitin'.
Come to papa. Come to papa.

13:04.126 --> 13:08.728
Ninety-seven and a half. Ninety-seven and
a half. Sold for a tidy $300,000 profit.

13:08.730 --> 13:11.330
God, it's good to be good.

13:11.332 --> 13:13.865
- What'd she say?
- Hello, you.

13:15.101 --> 13:17.101
Patricia.

13:18.304 --> 13:20.904
All right, Patricia,
what'd I do?

13:20.906 --> 13:24.340
I just told you that you had a
son, and you didn't even hear me.

13:24.342 --> 13:26.375
What are you talking about,
I have a son? What son?

13:26.377 --> 13:31.046
Your son. The boy sitting next to
the fire over there is your son.

13:45.862 --> 13:48.362
That is my son?

13:52.835 --> 13:55.268
I must've started
a thousand letters to tell you,

13:55.270 --> 13:58.237
but every one of them started with,
"I know you never wanted children."

13:58.239 --> 14:01.173
- This is nuts. This is nuts. This is unbelievable.
- I was confused.

14:01.175 --> 14:04.343
- Do you know what you just said to me? This is unforgivable!
- I didn't know what to do.

14:04.344 --> 14:07.512
I'm not asking you to forgive me, but he
didn't do anything, so don't blame him.

14:24.297 --> 14:26.764
That's my son?

14:34.307 --> 14:36.340
His name is Mimi siku.

14:38.010 --> 14:40.010
His name is what?

14:40.879 --> 14:43.212
Mimi siku.

14:43.214 --> 14:45.647
Mimi siku.

14:45.649 --> 14:48.416
Roughly translated it means...

14:48.418 --> 14:51.986
Cat piss.

14:51.988 --> 14:54.955
- He picked the name cat piss?
- He was six years old at the time.

14:54.957 --> 14:57.123
It's a territorial thing.

14:57.125 --> 14:59.258
- You sure he's mine?
- Positive.

14:59.260 --> 15:02.094
He's got your nose,
and he thinks he's never wrong.

15:03.097 --> 15:06.498
Hello, you.

15:06.500 --> 15:08.633
No, no. Go. Get away.
No, no, no. Don't touch that!

15:08.635 --> 15:11.002
Don't touch that. No.
Don't touch that.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.208
Ohh.

15:20.545 --> 15:22.912
You wouldn't happen to have a place
where I could stick that, would ya?

15:22.914 --> 15:24.914
Hello, you.

15:39.163 --> 15:41.429
Talk about
your wind instruments.

15:50.939 --> 15:54.173
Oh, ease up on the fruit,
for God sakes.

15:56.410 --> 15:58.410
Mitsubishi!

15:59.579 --> 16:02.079
Mimi siku.

16:03.615 --> 16:08.184
Hi, uh, Mimi siku.
I'm Michael cromwell.

16:08.186 --> 16:11.253
Patricia... oh, um... paliku...

16:11.255 --> 16:14.089
tells me that, um,

16:14.091 --> 16:16.123
that I-I'm... I'm your father.

16:18.660 --> 16:21.694
That's a nice pot you have.

16:21.696 --> 16:23.996
Do you understand any English?

16:26.400 --> 16:31.202
Well, Patricia... or paliku... wanted
me to say somethin' paternal to ya.

16:31.204 --> 16:33.237
And I gotta admit,
th-this isn't easy for me.

16:33.239 --> 16:36.206
I don't have any regrets.
Well, I have regrets.

16:37.676 --> 16:40.276
But then again... <i>too
few to mention</i> hah!

17:28.358 --> 17:30.392
Michael.

17:31.762 --> 17:34.062
- You all right?
- Yes.

17:34.064 --> 17:36.497
You should put air bags
in these things.

17:39.068 --> 17:42.436
What do you call this place
again? The surface of the sun?

17:42.438 --> 17:45.071
Mimi said that you talked
to him last night.

17:45.073 --> 17:47.206
I told him that I was
his father, and, uh,

17:47.208 --> 17:51.543
he said somethin' in Indian
and then gave a girl a pot.

17:51.545 --> 17:55.580
Giving a pot here is like giving flowers.
It's a love gift.

17:55.582 --> 17:58.616
He's very popular
with the girls.

17:58.618 --> 18:00.684
Maybe he is mine after all.

18:00.686 --> 18:03.220
He is yours.

18:03.221 --> 18:05.755
Why don't you try again? He's going
out on the river. Go with him.

18:05.757 --> 18:08.257
Maybe I can teach him
about commodities.

18:08.259 --> 18:10.826
Based on what I learned here
in the bachelor hut last night,

18:10.828 --> 18:13.195
he could make a killing
in gas futures.

18:13.197 --> 18:16.164
- Go.
- Is it the local fruit?

18:34.183 --> 18:37.584
- Baboon! Baboon!
- Huh?

18:37.586 --> 18:40.385
No, no, no, no.
Uh, uh, a monkey.

18:41.855 --> 18:44.121
Monkey.

18:48.593 --> 18:50.593
Parasite.

18:50.595 --> 18:54.395
No, uh, Mimi. Um... water. Wa...

18:56.499 --> 19:00.133
piranha.

19:00.135 --> 19:03.235
Cut. Infection. Death.

19:04.471 --> 19:06.471
Oh.

19:13.445 --> 19:15.578
<i>Hoko:</i> Bird.

19:15.580 --> 19:18.781
Bird who can't sing: <i>Hoko</i> ono.

19:18.783 --> 19:22.584
No, no, no, no, no.
<i>Hoko</i> is toucan.

19:22.586 --> 19:25.620
"Bird" is <i> pomoko.</i>

19:26.656 --> 19:29.590
- You speak English?
- Paliku taught me.

19:29.592 --> 19:32.593
So, you understood
everything I said last night.

19:42.303 --> 19:45.904
Is it much further? You know,
these shoes cost me $500. Whoa.

19:51.778 --> 19:54.612
Hey, hey, hey!

19:55.448 --> 19:57.447
Good shot.

20:00.919 --> 20:03.853
<i>Buradu.</i>

20:03.855 --> 20:06.755
Okay.

20:06.757 --> 20:10.625
- Scared of snake?
- No. Scared of snake bite.

20:19.936 --> 20:23.537
- This <i> buradu</i> is dead, right?
- Sleeping. We kill it before we eat it.

20:23.539 --> 20:26.639
No, no, no, no, no.
I do not eat snake.

20:30.344 --> 20:35.613
- Lizard guts.
- You know, actually the snake filled me right up.

20:35.615 --> 20:39.382
No, no, no, no, no.
I make it for you. Taste good.

20:42.954 --> 20:46.655
Now you here you stay with me
all the time?

20:46.657 --> 20:49.658
I'd like to, Mimi siku,
but I can't.

20:49.660 --> 20:52.661
Why?

20:52.663 --> 20:56.865
Well, I have a whole
'nother life where I live.

20:56.867 --> 21:01.703
- Another son?
- No. You're the only son I have.

21:01.705 --> 21:04.806
- I'll teach you to hunt.
- Tomorrow, I've gotta go back to my village.

21:04.808 --> 21:06.841
I'm a trader.
That's what I do, okay?

21:08.911 --> 21:11.745
Thi... this in
your village, yes?

21:11.747 --> 21:14.214
Woman who hold fire
up sky's butt?

21:16.651 --> 21:20.753
I've never... I've never had her
described quite like that.

21:20.755 --> 21:25.224
Yeah, she's in my village. We
call her the statue of liberty.

21:25.226 --> 21:28.660
When I'm a man, will you take me
to statue of liberty?

21:28.662 --> 21:32.864
Sure. Why not? Yeah. When you're a man,
I'll take you to the statue of liberty.

21:45.544 --> 21:47.777
Sleep time.

22:17.741 --> 22:20.908
Mimi, don't move!

22:20.910 --> 22:23.043
Don't move!
There's a giant spider on ya!

22:24.513 --> 22:26.880
Don't move! What's it doin'?

22:26.882 --> 22:30.450
Oh, great!
It's now comin' up to me!

22:30.452 --> 22:32.885
Damn, it's chasin' me!
Wait! Stop! Stop! Stop!

22:32.887 --> 22:35.888
I don't want to hurt you,
but I will.

22:35.890 --> 22:39.323
I will crush you like a bug.

22:41.794 --> 22:45.996
Mimi, don't! No, no! I can handle this.
Go to the village. Save yourself.

23:01.746 --> 23:05.347
No, no! Back! Jesus!

23:19.061 --> 23:22.695
If you scream, maitika attack.

23:22.697 --> 23:27.533
If you're calm, maitika nice.
But kukuve always mean.

23:27.535 --> 23:29.935
Who's kukuve?

23:36.376 --> 23:38.943
This place is a nightmare!

23:55.861 --> 23:59.729
Nice turtle.

23:59.731 --> 24:02.798
The hair on your chest
reminds them of a monkey.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.800
"Baboon" is your pinare name.

24:04.802 --> 24:07.402
Baboon? That's the best
they can come up with?

24:07.404 --> 24:11.506
Well, at first they wanted to go with
"man who must be smarter than he looks."

24:11.508 --> 24:14.075
If we get to pick our own names,
I'd like to pick this:

24:14.077 --> 24:17.044
Man who's extremely
well-endowed.

24:17.046 --> 24:19.880
Sorry, it's already taken.

24:27.688 --> 24:30.622
- What's he sayin' to 'em?
- The chief is telling the forest...

24:30.624 --> 24:32.624
That Mimi's no longer a child.

25:00.753 --> 25:04.154
- Are they finished?
- Almost.

25:04.156 --> 25:06.956
But to become
a tribal leader someday,

25:06.958 --> 25:10.559
Mimi has to perform a special task
that the chief will give to him.

25:12.763 --> 25:17.966
He says he's very proud of Mimi siku,
and as his father, you should be too.

25:19.536 --> 25:22.036
Well, I am very proud of him
considering the fact...

25:22.038 --> 25:24.538
That I just found out
a couple days ago I had a son,

25:24.540 --> 25:27.541
and I'm standing about
four feet from a witch doctor.

25:38.186 --> 25:40.186
The chief has given
Mimi the task...

25:40.188 --> 25:44.557
Of bringing fire back
from the statue of liberty.

25:44.559 --> 25:46.625
- Guy doesn't kid around, does he?
- You promised...

25:46.627 --> 25:48.693
To take me to New York
when I become a man, baboon.

25:48.695 --> 25:50.695
When... when you're a man,
I will.

25:50.697 --> 25:55.633
In this tribe, he is a man,
and he wants to go now?

25:55.635 --> 26:00.004
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Tomorrow
we fly to caracas, we sign the divorce papers,

26:00.006 --> 26:03.040
then I get in the big steel bird
and fly back to New York City.

26:05.077 --> 26:07.811
Did you promise to take him
to New York or not?

26:07.813 --> 26:11.514
Maybe. Mimi siku, I have to be
back at the exchange floor.

26:11.516 --> 26:13.749
I'm gettin' married.
I cannot take you tomorrow.

26:13.751 --> 26:16.051
Here, if you make a promise,
you keep it.

26:16.053 --> 26:19.087
"Tomorrow." "Can't." "Maybe." These
words don't mean anything to Mimi.

26:19.089 --> 26:21.489
- He doesn't understand them.
- It's not my fault he doesn't understand.

26:21.490 --> 26:23.890
You're his mom. You brought him down here
to live with the pirates of the Caribbean.

26:23.893 --> 26:25.993
- Maybe you shoulda taught him better English.
- This is...

26:25.995 --> 26:28.628
The most important day
in your son's life,

26:28.630 --> 26:31.230
and he wanted you here
to share it with him.

26:31.232 --> 26:33.632
And now you're gonna humiliate him
in front of the whole tribe...

26:33.634 --> 26:36.501
By not keeping the first promise
you ever made to him?

26:36.503 --> 26:40.638
Baboon, I... I want to go.

26:40.640 --> 26:46.076
Mimi siku, I am...
I'm very sorry.

26:46.078 --> 26:48.144
You made <i> wakatepe</i> with me.

27:18.975 --> 27:21.942
Excuse me, Mr. cromwell,

27:21.944 --> 27:26.212
but the young man you're with
is urinating on the exit door.

27:27.582 --> 27:29.682
Thank you.

27:36.556 --> 27:38.989
Me happy to be with you, baboon.

27:43.562 --> 27:45.663
Michael! Michael!

27:45.665 --> 27:48.666
All right, we gotta get
movin' here pretty... come on.

27:48.668 --> 27:51.134
Get on there. It's just...
it's a moving sidewalk.

27:54.205 --> 27:56.271
Michael! Hey, Mike!

27:56.273 --> 27:59.140
- Michael. How ya doin'?
- Richard, what are you doin' here?

27:59.142 --> 28:01.809
I told Langston you had a reason.
You do have a reason, right?

28:01.811 --> 28:04.011
- For what?
- For holding onto the beans.

28:04.013 --> 28:07.080
- What beans?
- The coffee beans.

28:07.082 --> 28:09.182
- You didn't sell them?
- No.

28:09.184 --> 28:11.817
I told you to sell them
at 97 and a half.

28:13.987 --> 28:16.220
Oh, God! I'm dead!

28:16.222 --> 28:19.856
I'm gonna lose my house!
Where will my children live?

28:19.858 --> 28:23.059
Richard. Richard. Excuse me.
Richard, Richard, Richard.

28:23.061 --> 28:25.761
Come on. Why didn't ya sell?

28:25.763 --> 28:28.764
'Cause you didn't confirm,
that's why!

28:28.766 --> 28:30.799
- What?
- You did not confirm.

28:30.801 --> 28:32.901
- What's coffee doin' now?
- It's under 90 cents...

28:32.903 --> 28:34.936
And gone limit down!

28:36.906 --> 28:40.440
I asked you, I told you
to sell it at 97 and a half,

28:40.442 --> 28:42.708
and you can't do it
'cause I didn't say "confirm"?

28:42.710 --> 28:45.377
- You're an idiot.
- Look, for 15 years, Michael,

28:45.379 --> 28:47.245
you say "sell," I say "confirm."

28:47.247 --> 28:49.213
"Sell." "Confirm."
"Sell." "Confirm."

28:49.215 --> 28:52.916
You confirm, and I sell. You
didn't confirm, so I didn't sell.

28:52.918 --> 28:55.285
Look, kid, I've given
to the rain forest, okay?

28:55.287 --> 28:58.187
His name is Mimi siku.

28:59.490 --> 29:02.491
- He's my son.
- What do you mean "son"?

29:02.493 --> 29:05.327
Uh... y-you didn't have one when
you left here three days ago.

29:05.329 --> 29:08.797
Well, apparently I did.

29:08.799 --> 29:10.799
He's Patricia's son.

29:12.969 --> 29:15.235
He's Patricia and my son.

29:19.841 --> 29:23.408
- This your village, baboon?
- Yep. This is my village.

29:25.478 --> 29:28.111
It's big.

29:54.238 --> 29:56.504
Where are all the animals?

29:56.506 --> 29:58.906
Up in their offices,
where they work.

30:00.442 --> 30:02.842
Cromwell!

30:02.844 --> 30:04.844
Okay, take a look at that.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.946
Baboon must go fight the chief.

30:08.249 --> 30:11.984
Look at this!
Cromwell, look at this.

30:11.986 --> 30:16.355
Coffee is at 88,
and it's dropping like a brick.

30:16.357 --> 30:20.025
By tomorrow morning,
it could be 85 or lower.

30:20.027 --> 30:24.329
If we just wait it out, something'll
happen. The market will turn around.

30:24.331 --> 30:26.564
- But what if it doesn't?
- You remember what happened in '91?

30:26.566 --> 30:29.433
You can't always depend
on a natural disaster.

30:29.435 --> 30:32.803
It doesn't have to be a natural disaster.
We can hope for an assassination.

30:32.805 --> 30:34.972
- Oh, would you take it seriously for once?
- In just a minute.

30:34.973 --> 30:37.140
- I'm tryin' to lighten this guy up.
- Stop it! Stop it! Now come on.

30:37.142 --> 30:41.077
Behave yourselves here! Now
something better happen fast...

30:41.079 --> 30:44.246
Or I'm gonna throw
both your butts out the window.

30:44.248 --> 30:47.515
What the hell do you hotshots think
about when you make these deals?

30:47.517 --> 30:53.420
You seem to have forgotten, cromwell, that
you were investing the company's money!

30:53.422 --> 30:57.824
When you invest the company's money
and win, the company's behind you.

30:57.826 --> 31:03.495
But when you screw up like this, you're
both on the hook for any loss we take.

31:03.497 --> 31:07.031
- It would be over a million dollars.
- Now that's not my problem.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.133
And by the way, cromwell,

31:09.135 --> 31:14.304
when somebody is playing with
millions of dollars of my money,

31:14.306 --> 31:16.572
I generally like them
in the country.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.274
- This country!
- Sto... stop yelling, please.

31:19.276 --> 31:23.111
This is still my office.
I'll shout, I'll yell,

31:23.113 --> 31:26.615
I'll scream as much as I want.

31:26.616 --> 31:30.118
When I made you shareholders in this company,
it was to share profits, not losses!

31:30.120 --> 31:33.454
Not losses is right. We're not
here to share, share losses.

31:33.456 --> 31:35.522
We're here to share profits!

31:35.524 --> 31:38.558
Profits! Profits!

31:40.628 --> 31:44.997
Look up! It's a... an alien circle
with Mickey Rourke's picture in it.

31:44.999 --> 31:48.400
Look at it!
Look, look, look, look, look!

31:48.402 --> 31:50.869
Up! Up! Look! Look up! Look up!

31:50.871 --> 31:53.171
He... he just found out
that he has a son.

31:55.108 --> 31:57.975
- Look, look, look, look, look!
- Stop shouting, baboon.

31:57.977 --> 32:00.877
- Maitika kill chief.
- Catch the damn spider, will ya, please?

32:00.879 --> 32:03.012
Go, go, go.

32:03.014 --> 32:07.082
I-I... I said I was gonna go fight
the chief, not kill the chief.

32:07.084 --> 32:10.885
Around here, only
postal employees kill chief.

32:10.887 --> 32:12.920
Do you understand?

32:17.092 --> 32:21.561
Boy, whatever you do in Venezuela,
do not try the chili del fuego.

32:30.104 --> 32:32.971
And I say
we should just wait it out.

32:32.973 --> 32:35.373
You're insane. Langston
is right. You know, we, we, we,

32:35.375 --> 32:40.110
we have to find a buyer for the coffee,
cut our losses and get out now.

32:42.314 --> 32:45.314
Wow. Nice shot.

32:48.018 --> 32:50.318
Put this away!

32:50.320 --> 32:53.421
Would you give me a few moments with
Charlotte before you bring Mimi up, okay?

32:53.423 --> 32:55.456
All right.

33:00.528 --> 33:03.262
- Michael, you're back!
- Boys. Brian. Brian.

33:03.264 --> 33:05.264
Come on. Let's go.
Come on. Come, come, come!

33:07.568 --> 33:10.001
Oh, I missed you.
You never called me.

33:10.003 --> 33:12.003
- Well, I had...
- I was so worried.

33:12.005 --> 33:14.405
Uh, we're here,
but we're not "here," okay?

33:14.407 --> 33:18.142
Try to think of us
as, uh, furniture.

33:18.144 --> 33:20.711
Just act natural.
So did you miss me, darling?

33:22.214 --> 33:24.948
I missed you very much.

33:24.950 --> 33:28.017
My pieces in the show
were such a hit that Ian...

33:28.019 --> 33:31.053
- Michael cromwell, this is Ian Finch-chumley.
- Good to meet you, Ian.

33:31.055 --> 33:35.123
- Hi, Michael.
- He's gonna be doing a profile on me for the fashion channel.

33:35.125 --> 33:37.158
He'll be following me from now
through the spring collection,

33:37.160 --> 33:39.393
and he'll be covering
the wedding as well.

33:39.395 --> 33:42.162
Isn't that fabulous?

33:42.164 --> 33:44.531
There's... there's a...
there's a fashion channel?

33:44.533 --> 33:46.666
- Yeah.
- Forget the camera.

33:46.668 --> 33:49.001
Just talk to me.
They're furniture.

33:49.003 --> 33:51.436
Now, honey, did you
get everything settled?

33:54.140 --> 33:56.707
- Yeah.
- Yes! Oh!

33:56.709 --> 33:58.975
Actually... um, actually,

34:00.044 --> 34:02.010
Patricia was, was
very reasonable.

34:02.012 --> 34:04.178
So?

34:04.180 --> 34:08.081
What did you bring me?

34:08.083 --> 34:11.217
- Ow!
- So, Mimi, how old are you?

34:11.219 --> 34:15.087
The roots of the yomano tree...

34:15.089 --> 34:18.190
Have broken ground
three times in my life.

34:18.192 --> 34:22.627
So I guess that would
make you around...

34:22.629 --> 34:25.228
- thirteen.
- Thirteen. Thirteen.

34:26.665 --> 34:30.333
You know, I have a daughter
around that age... Karen.

34:30.335 --> 34:32.467
Will I meet daughter?

34:32.469 --> 34:34.503
Yeah. Yeah. Oh, no, she's
just up at Charlotte's house.

34:34.505 --> 34:36.737
She's trying on her dress
for the wedding.

34:38.007 --> 34:41.241
- What are you doing?
- Feed maitika.

34:41.243 --> 34:44.344
What's maitika?

34:49.550 --> 34:53.184
- Are you upset?
- You brought back a child.

34:53.186 --> 34:56.554
Everyone else I know comes back from
South America with a bag of coffee.

34:56.556 --> 35:01.125
Well, I have ten million bags of coffee. I thought I'd
bring you back somethin' with a little less caffeine.

35:01.127 --> 35:04.128
I have a show to prepare
and a wedding to plan.

35:05.498 --> 35:08.532
What the...
but that's months away.

35:08.534 --> 35:11.201
Honey!

35:11.203 --> 35:13.636
He's only gonna be here
for a short while.

35:20.477 --> 35:22.477
- Mimi.
- Baboon.

35:22.479 --> 35:25.079
- What have you done with Mr. kempster?
- Excuse me. Michael.

35:25.081 --> 35:27.480
- Do you know who maitika is?
- Daddy.

35:29.817 --> 35:32.217
Karen.

35:32.219 --> 35:36.220
Look at you. You look beautiful.

35:37.256 --> 35:40.223
Angel on table.

35:42.827 --> 35:47.462
- Look at me. I'm smoking.
- The rain forest is a very hot issue right now.

35:47.464 --> 35:52.600
Being associated with this, uh,
jungle bloke... it can only help you.

35:52.602 --> 35:56.170
Where is the rain forest?

35:56.172 --> 35:59.139
Brian, find out where
the rain forest is.

35:59.141 --> 36:01.274
Right.

36:03.411 --> 36:07.813
- Oh. Ah.
- Mimi siku, this is Charlotte.

36:07.815 --> 36:11.516
And, uh, Charlotte,
this is Mimi siku.

36:11.518 --> 36:13.551
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Mimi <i> siki.</i>

36:13.553 --> 36:15.553
- Mimi siku.
- Mimi siku.

36:15.555 --> 36:19.189
- This your female, baboon?
- This is my female.

36:19.191 --> 36:22.759
And as his female, I'd like to
invite you to dinner tonight...

36:22.761 --> 36:24.761
With Fiona gluckman.

36:24.763 --> 36:30.700
She's the fashion editor
of <i> Elle</i> magazine. Very major.

36:30.702 --> 36:33.335
She wants to see the sketches
for my wedding trousseau.

36:33.337 --> 36:37.405
And if you're available,
I'd love for you to join us.

36:37.407 --> 36:40.408
Is there anything special
you like to eat?

36:40.410 --> 36:42.410
Lizard guts.

36:42.412 --> 36:46.213
- Lizard guts?
- Yes, but very lean.

36:46.215 --> 36:48.715
- Great earrings. Honey!
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

36:48.717 --> 36:50.767
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Mimi. Mimi. Mimi.

36:50.768 --> 36:52.818
Do you remember what we talked about
using the toilet on the airplane?

36:52.821 --> 36:56.289
Let's continue to do that. Um, I
will find the men's room for him,

36:56.291 --> 36:59.191
and we will see you tonight.

36:59.193 --> 37:01.660
Come on, Mimi.

37:03.163 --> 37:05.296
Will he be wearing
the loin cloth to dinner?

37:05.298 --> 37:08.332
I'll get him some clothes.

37:08.334 --> 37:11.285
No, no, no. Don't...
don't touch it. Don't touch.

37:11.286 --> 37:14.237
Before you pee you lift the seat. After
you pee you put the seat back down.

37:14.239 --> 37:16.472
Females in tribes
start war over this.

37:16.474 --> 37:18.674
Many deaths.

37:20.911 --> 37:23.678
Oh, that's very good. Very...

37:23.680 --> 37:26.480
Bob Montgomery.
That's wonderful.

37:26.482 --> 37:29.649
Listen. So, Bob, I'm standing
with Michael cromwell,

37:29.651 --> 37:32.385
and, and, and you know, considering
our long history together,

37:32.387 --> 37:35.187
you're the first person
we wanted to make this offer to.

37:35.189 --> 37:39.857
Are you ready?
5,100 tons of coffee beans.

37:43.596 --> 37:46.463
- We're dead. Okay?
- Baboon!

37:46.465 --> 37:48.598
- Baboon!
- He's doing a fay wray!

37:48.600 --> 37:51.267
- Michael! Mumu!
- Mimi!

37:51.269 --> 37:53.603
- Come back inside!
- Statue of liberty, baboon!

37:53.605 --> 37:56.572
- You do as I tell you!
- Get this!

37:56.574 --> 38:00.275
- Come look!
- No, no, no. Come back here!

38:00.277 --> 38:02.377
- Mimi, wait. Get... get back in here. Come on.
- Cool!

38:02.379 --> 38:04.779
- Life happens around you.
- Come on. Move! Get outta my way. Come on.

38:04.781 --> 38:06.781
Mimi! Watch out,
watch out, watch out.

38:06.783 --> 38:09.416
- Mimi! Mimi!
- Get the wide angle lens for this.

38:09.418 --> 38:11.817
Stay outta the way, please.

38:13.821 --> 38:15.921
Mimi! Wait, wait, wait!

38:28.635 --> 38:31.068
Statue of liberty, baboon.

38:31.070 --> 38:35.872
- Statue not far, baboon.
- Mimi. You stand right there.

38:35.874 --> 38:38.441
- We go now?
- We'll go tomorrow, okay?

38:41.679 --> 38:44.312
Whoa.

38:44.314 --> 38:46.314
People down there
so far from us.

38:46.316 --> 38:50.885
I'd like to keep 'em
that way, okay?

38:50.887 --> 38:54.421
- I'm gonna die up here. I'm gonna die up here.
- Nothing bad happen, baboon.

38:54.423 --> 38:57.090
I just hate heights. I...

38:57.092 --> 39:00.026
whoa. Oh.

39:01.362 --> 39:03.695
Pinare secret: Don't look down.

39:03.697 --> 39:06.898
Just for the record,
it's not that big a secret.

39:10.737 --> 39:13.104
Yes!

39:13.106 --> 39:16.073
Don't you ever, ever, ever
do that to me again!

39:16.075 --> 39:19.709
When I tell you to do somethin',
I mean it. D'you understand me?

39:19.711 --> 39:21.744
Mimi siku sorry.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.079
Look. Look, look,
look, look. I-I'm...

39:27.750 --> 39:30.083
Sorry.

39:30.085 --> 39:32.552
I... I was just worried about you
out there. I really was.

39:32.554 --> 39:35.621
All right? W... um...
we should go.

39:40.928 --> 39:44.529
- Baboon scared?
- Yes, baboon scared.

39:44.531 --> 39:46.697
Baboon not know
he could be so scared.

39:46.699 --> 39:48.732
Baboon's pants a little damp.

39:53.538 --> 39:56.071
Oh, my God. Oh, Charlie!

39:56.073 --> 39:58.406
- Mimi, get down.
- This is fabulous!

39:58.408 --> 40:03.077
When I saw the shoulders
on this gown, I plotzed.

40:03.079 --> 40:08.481
I said to myself, "Fiona, this,
this is the future of fashion."

40:08.483 --> 40:10.549
O-oh, no.
Remember what I told ya?

40:10.551 --> 40:13.585
Forks go on the left side... this side.
Small fork on the outside.

40:13.587 --> 40:15.720
Take your knife,
put it over next to the spoon.

40:15.722 --> 40:18.422
Blade... blade in. Perfect.

40:18.424 --> 40:20.991
Yeah. You might wanna
work on that one too.

40:20.993 --> 40:25.628
In lipo lipo we eat with hands. -In
New York, New York, we eat with forks.

40:25.630 --> 40:28.731
When are we gonna eat?
I'm famished.

40:28.733 --> 40:30.766
A little champagne?

40:30.768 --> 40:32.768
You know, why don't we show her
the bride's maids sketches?

40:32.770 --> 40:34.803
Show me, show me,
show me, show me.

40:37.908 --> 40:40.841
Oh, I'm loving this!

40:44.046 --> 40:46.579
What is taking so long
with the food?

40:46.581 --> 40:48.614
I'll give them a call.

40:49.950 --> 40:53.785
I don't eat meat.
I don't eat dairy...

40:53.787 --> 40:55.787
Or nightshade vegetables,

40:55.789 --> 40:58.756
and of course
I don't touch preservatives.

40:58.758 --> 41:01.658
Obviously.

41:01.660 --> 41:04.460
- Cat fat.
- Mm-hmm.

41:04.462 --> 41:06.928
- We eat cat.
- Excuse me?

41:09.599 --> 41:11.599
- That must be the food.
- Oh! Finally.

41:11.601 --> 41:14.134
- Gino. Louis.
- Coming.

41:15.137 --> 41:17.637
We are not going to eat the cat.

41:23.511 --> 41:25.577
Cat's job: Feed people.

41:25.579 --> 41:30.648
No, not here. Here, cat's job
is to sleep and lick crotch.

41:30.650 --> 41:35.552
Oh! Charlotte, it smells so good! I
can't stand it. I can't stand it.

41:35.554 --> 41:37.854
Course, this is
much too much for me.

41:37.856 --> 41:39.889
Did they forget my tiramisu?

41:43.794 --> 41:46.961
- Oh, God.
- This much tasty.

41:46.963 --> 41:48.963
Your female
makes good food, baboon.

41:50.566 --> 41:53.133
Oh, Louis,
you are such a cliche.

42:05.713 --> 42:08.580
You had no right
to change the rules.

42:08.582 --> 42:11.149
- What rules?
- When we talked about having children,

42:11.151 --> 42:14.652
we agreed that you would be my child
and that I would be your child.

42:14.654 --> 42:17.755
And now I find out that
you've had a child all along.

42:17.757 --> 42:20.758
Wait a second! Are you saying
I knew that I had a child?

42:20.760 --> 42:23.761
Well, if I had a child,
I certainly would've known.

42:23.763 --> 42:25.863
Hello? You're a woman.
Of course you'd know.

42:25.865 --> 42:28.565
You're there when you have it.

42:28.567 --> 42:32.268
Look, there's no magical bond between a
father and son that spans the continents.

42:32.270 --> 42:35.704
The only reason I know I have a
child is because you insisted...

42:35.706 --> 42:38.907
- Oh, so now you're saying that you having a child is my fault.
- I go down the Amazon to finalize the divorce.

42:38.909 --> 42:41.776
- I don't think so, Michael.
- Mimi's just visiting.

42:41.778 --> 42:45.112
I wanna show him a good time.
After that, he goes back home,

42:45.114 --> 42:48.115
and we can go back to being
exactly the way we were:

42:48.117 --> 42:51.785
Entirely wrapped up
in ourselves.

42:51.787 --> 42:54.587
Promise?

43:46.807 --> 43:48.807
Ow!

44:40.060 --> 44:43.294
My little darlings.

44:45.865 --> 44:48.866
Ahh! Ooh!

44:48.868 --> 44:51.134
Are your little bellies empty?

44:51.136 --> 44:53.136
Aww.

44:53.771 --> 44:55.937
Bonjour.

44:57.140 --> 44:59.173
Bonjour-r-r.

44:59.175 --> 45:02.943
We are all so happy today,
<i>n'est-ce pas?</i>

45:05.280 --> 45:07.346
What's goin' on up here?

45:08.882 --> 45:12.884
You... go, go,
go, go, go, go, go, go!

45:12.886 --> 45:16.888
Mimi, you can't do this. We do not
kill birds around here for breakfast.

45:16.890 --> 45:20.424
If you're hungry, ask me.
I bought some stuff for ya.

45:20.426 --> 45:23.260
This is what kids love:
Cap'n crunch.

45:24.296 --> 45:27.714
- What is?
- This is cereal.

45:27.715 --> 45:31.133
It's just corn, brown sugar,
yellow number five and zinc oxide.

45:31.136 --> 45:33.136
They've added a sunblock to it.

45:34.005 --> 45:36.705
You pour this on this.

45:36.707 --> 45:38.806
That's your breakfast.
Enjoy yourself.

45:41.043 --> 45:43.376
Charlie.

45:43.378 --> 45:45.378
Come on. Wake up, sweetheart.

45:45.380 --> 45:50.916
Wake up. Charlie,
bloomingdale's burned down.

45:50.918 --> 45:53.785
- What?
- Mimi's havin' breakfast out in the kitchen.

45:53.787 --> 45:56.154
I will be home before lunch.

45:56.156 --> 45:58.756
- Bye.
- Bye. Wait!

45:58.758 --> 46:01.058
I can't watch him.

46:01.060 --> 46:03.160
Women's wear is coming
to the loft.

46:03.162 --> 46:05.896
You don't need to baby-sit him.
He'll be fine.

46:05.898 --> 46:07.898
Now go back to sleep.

46:15.707 --> 46:18.874
Mimi, I gotta get goin' here.
No, no!

46:18.876 --> 46:21.810
This is... n... no,
it's not, not, not your fault.

46:21.811 --> 46:24.745
I-I didn't... I didn't mention that
you usually put this in a bowl.

46:24.748 --> 46:26.748
Wh-when we go
to statue of liberty?

46:26.750 --> 46:29.050
- Uh, tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

46:29.052 --> 46:32.119
I know I told you we were
goin' today, but I can't today.

46:32.121 --> 46:35.188
I've... I've... baboon's makin'
some very big trades today.

46:35.190 --> 46:38.257
- Me go trade with baboon.
- Baboon go alone.

46:38.259 --> 46:40.826
I'd like to be around you,
but, but...

46:40.828 --> 46:43.295
I'm obligated to go.

46:43.297 --> 46:47.131
- What means "obligated"?
- Obligated. I-it means...

46:48.934 --> 46:52.902
When you do somethin' that
you don't really wanna do.

46:52.904 --> 46:56.305
Okay.

46:56.307 --> 47:00.909
- Baboon obligated.
- And, uh, will you promise baboon one thing?

47:00.911 --> 47:03.511
You won't shoot
any more animals?

47:05.848 --> 47:08.014
And don't eat the cat.

47:08.016 --> 47:10.116
I'll bring food home.

47:39.247 --> 47:41.313
Maitika.

47:41.315 --> 47:43.981
Maitika? Maitika?

47:46.285 --> 47:48.385
Maitika?

47:49.921 --> 47:51.954
Maitika?

47:53.791 --> 47:55.791
Maitika.

47:57.060 --> 47:59.126
Maitika.

48:00.896 --> 48:02.896
Maitika.

48:07.903 --> 48:09.903
Maitika.

48:19.314 --> 48:22.581
- Nice <i> pushibushi.</i>
- That is the last <i> pushibushi...</i>

48:22.583 --> 48:25.116
You're gonna see around here,
you little savage!

48:34.593 --> 48:39.329
<i>Hi, we're not here right now. Leave a
message. We'll call you right back.</i>

48:39.331 --> 48:41.397
<i>Charlie, pick up. It's me.</i>

48:43.367 --> 48:46.067
You're probably in the bathroom
makin' yourself look beautiful.

48:46.069 --> 48:48.969
<i>Um, I don't want you
feelin' trapped by Mimi.</i>

48:48.971 --> 48:53.540
Try to open up to him. Just don't
leave him alone with the cat.

48:53.542 --> 48:56.009
<i>I'll see ya soon.
I love you. Bye.</i>

49:00.015 --> 49:05.018
Michael, don't hang up!
Don't hang up! There's a spider!

49:05.020 --> 49:09.322
This can't be happening!
This is a penthouse apartment!

49:09.324 --> 49:13.125
<i>There's nothing to gain
when there's nothing to be lost</i>

49:15.295 --> 49:19.230
<i>there's nothing to gain if you
stay behind and count the cost</i>

49:21.300 --> 49:27.170
<i>make a decision you can be

49:27.172 --> 49:31.540

You can never have enough

52:21.486 --> 52:23.452
Look, Mimi,
I've got a life here.

52:23.454 --> 52:25.454
I can't change everything
just because you showed up.

52:25.456 --> 52:28.490
- Then why you bring me here?
- I was obligated.

52:35.665 --> 52:38.232

- You said "obligated"!

52:56.349 --> 52:58.849

- You always angry at me!

53:19.436 --> 53:22.170
- "Don't do this. Don't do that."

53:22.172 --> 53:26.440
- This is a dangerous jungle.
- Mimi siku not scared. Mimi siku a man.

53:26.442 --> 53:29.709
No, you're not a man.
You are an adolescent.

53:29.711 --> 53:33.212
- Adolescent?
- Yes, an adolescent.

53:33.214 --> 53:35.781
You don't have a wife.

53:35.783 --> 53:37.816
You don't have
a family to support.

53:37.818 --> 53:40.185
You are free to do
whatever you want.

53:41.321 --> 53:44.188
You're an adolescent.

53:44.190 --> 53:48.859
What? No, no, no, no, no! I am
not an adolescent. I'm a man.

53:48.861 --> 53:51.928
- I'm a man too.
- Not here you're not a man.

53:51.930 --> 53:54.463
You're a 13-year-old boy
running around in a loincloth.

53:54.465 --> 53:56.832
I'm a man too!

54:04.941 --> 54:09.376
Okay, okay. You're right.
You are a man.

54:09.378 --> 54:12.479
But you're gonna have to learn
what men do in my jungle.

54:12.481 --> 54:15.715
And you have to learn
how to breathe when you run.

54:18.486 --> 54:20.486
Okay, first lesson. Ooh!

54:20.488 --> 54:22.855
You wanna go someplace
in my village,

54:22.857 --> 54:25.991
all you gotta do
is wave your arm.

54:25.993 --> 54:28.226
Wave your arm.

54:32.599 --> 54:35.967
- Magic.
- No, magic will be if he understands English.

54:37.470 --> 54:39.736
All right, fulton fish market
on "ze" double.

54:39.738 --> 54:42.739
Okay.

54:42.741 --> 54:46.976
Wh-where is he? Richard, this guy
gets very upset when you're late.

54:46.978 --> 54:50.012
Yes, well, he's gonna be here.
He-he's obviously delayed...

54:50.014 --> 54:52.647
here he is! Okay.

54:52.649 --> 54:55.282
- All right. Get your stuff. Get out on the other side.
- Thank you very much.

54:55.284 --> 54:58.585
- You call this a tip?
- Watch it. Mimi, watch traffic when you're comin' around.

54:58.587 --> 55:02.755
- What took you...
- We're meeting this guy at a fish stall?

55:02.757 --> 55:05.824
No, no, he is
above a fish stall.

55:05.826 --> 55:08.326
Much better.

55:10.763 --> 55:13.597
Oh, I love what they've
done with the place.

55:13.599 --> 55:16.733
Now, look. Let me tell you something.
This guy has a lot of money, okay?

55:16.735 --> 55:19.268
He's the king of caviar,
and he's gonna save our asses.

55:19.270 --> 55:21.536
So you just play your hunches
and let me play mine.

55:21.538 --> 55:24.605
Okay, okay. Now listen up.

55:24.607 --> 55:28.408
When you get to the top of
the stairs, ring the bell once,

55:28.410 --> 55:32.812
knock twice,
then ring three times.

55:34.348 --> 55:36.948
- Okay.
- Don't forget.

55:39.018 --> 55:42.819
- What happened to his fingers?
- He rang four times.

55:42.821 --> 55:44.821
Good luck.

55:47.525 --> 55:50.459
Ring twice, knock once,
ring three times. Okay.

55:50.461 --> 55:52.828
- Oh, boy.
- Okay, um, okay.

55:52.830 --> 55:54.629
- So, it is...
- What? What?

55:54.631 --> 55:56.530
- Ring twice.
- Ring twice. Got it. Got it. Got it.

55:56.532 --> 55:58.765
Knock once, and then
you ring three times.

55:58.767 --> 56:00.867
- You sure it's three?
- Yes, it's definitely three times.

56:00.869 --> 56:02.902
Okay.

56:07.575 --> 56:10.876
Okay, that's wrong. So what
we do... ring three times.

56:10.878 --> 56:13.712
- I'm not sure it...
- Knock once and ring twice.

56:13.714 --> 56:16.347
- No, it would be...
- Yeah, yeah.

56:16.349 --> 56:19.783
- We're gonna get shot.
- Mm-mm. No, it's gonna be fine. It's gonna be good.

56:19.785 --> 56:22.269
- Yeah, okay, that really worked out great.
- Seriously.

56:22.270 --> 56:24.754
- I remember differently now. I got what it is.
- All right, Mr. wizard. Take over, please.

56:24.756 --> 56:26.355

- Take over.

56:26.357 --> 56:28.390

56:28.391 --> 56:30.424

Open damn door!

56:42.070 --> 56:44.070
- Hi, there. I am, uh...

56:44.072 --> 56:46.405
Don't say a word.
I know, I know.

56:46.407 --> 56:48.874
Let me introduce
my comrades to you.

56:48.876 --> 56:51.943
Stand up. Thank you. Sit down.

56:51.945 --> 56:54.812
Come. We talk beans.

Coffee on market

57:01.920 --> 57:06.889
I pay you 85 cents one pound.

57:06.891 --> 57:08.790
- Why you take trade?
- Shhh.

57:08.792 --> 57:12.493
- Uh, Michael.
- 85 cents more than 83 cents?

57:12.495 --> 57:15.729
- Yes, it is.
- Tell wild child to shut up!

57:15.731 --> 57:17.731
- Hey!
- You know, he's just a kid.

57:17.733 --> 57:20.700
I mean, hey, listen.
He's... he's an unusual kid.

57:20.702 --> 57:22.902
Not now, mama.

57:22.904 --> 57:25.371
So moving on.
So we have a deal then?

57:25.373 --> 57:29.808
I want guarantee the price
not drop below 75.

57:29.810 --> 57:31.876
- You got it.
- Wait a minute!

57:31.878 --> 57:35.412
There are no guarantees.
This is a speculation.

57:35.414 --> 57:38.481
I know speculation.

57:38.483 --> 57:42.484
He knows speculation, for heaven's sakes.
So, so when can we expect payment?

57:43.887 --> 57:46.553
Oh, this is lovely.

57:49.157 --> 57:51.991
Look, Richard, it's cash.

57:51.993 --> 57:55.861
- Oh, my.

57:55.863 --> 58:00.532
Look, um, would it be possible to
talk to my partner in private?

58:00.534 --> 58:03.534
- Of course.
- Richard, let's go.

58:06.472 --> 58:08.738
It'll just take a moment.

58:14.144 --> 58:16.144
Richard, are you
out of your mind?

58:16.146 --> 58:18.746
Now we're laundering money

58:18.748 --> 58:21.815
Yes, we are. And we'll

- Just get us out of this.

58:34.994 --> 58:37.494
- All right.
- Problem?

58:37.496 --> 58:39.762
Oh, no. No, no, not at all.

Oh, you'll get used
to those shoes.

01:01:24.097 --> 01:01:28.432
Huh? Here. Why don't you
give her the flowers, huh?

01:01:28.434 --> 01:01:31.268
Charlie,

- Michael, I've been in this bathroom for hours!

01:01:39.076 --> 01:01:41.910
- Make sure you open a window.
- Michael!

01:01:41.912 --> 01:01:44.379
I'm being attacked
by a giant spider!

01:01:44.381 --> 01:01:47.382
Oh! Uh, uh, I-I-I can see it.

01:01:47.384 --> 01:01:49.884
Move away from the door! Quickly,

- Grab this thing. Come on, come on, come on.
- Do something!

01:01:51.988 --> 01:01:54.421
Oh, I'm doing something. I'm gonna
fight it. Stay away from the door!

01:01:54.423 --> 01:01:56.890
Look at that. Look at that. Oh,
it's a big one! It's a big one!

01:01:56.892 --> 01:01:59.392
- Be careful!
- I'm gonna put it in the wastebasket.

01:01:59.394 --> 01:02:02.762
Don't come out here yet.
It's still moving.

01:02:02.764 --> 01:02:04.897
- Put the thing back in his box.
- What?

01:02:04.899 --> 01:02:07.432
It's as big as an ox!

01:02:07.434 --> 01:02:11.903
You bad girl, maitika.
Stay here.

01:02:15.842 --> 01:02:17.875
To him it's like a pet.

01:02:17.877 --> 01:02:21.411
No, no, no, no. A dog is a pet,
Michael. A cat is a pet.

01:02:21.413 --> 01:02:25.948
Although for your son, a cat
is a dietary supplement as well.

01:02:25.950 --> 01:02:28.083
We'll just keep him out
on the balcony.

01:02:28.085 --> 01:02:30.385
How do you know it hasn't already
laid eggs in the apartment?

01:02:30.387 --> 01:02:33.020
- I'll have the place fumigated.
- Well, what if they miss one...

01:02:33.022 --> 01:02:35.155
And it grows up and crawls
into my ear one night...

01:02:35.157 --> 01:02:37.824
While I'm sleeping and
lays its eggs in my brain?

01:02:37.826 --> 01:02:40.359
We'll have to have them
come back and spray again.

01:02:40.361 --> 01:02:43.295
This is serious, Michael!
We have to move!

01:02:43.297 --> 01:02:45.830
You're blowing this
way out of proportion.

01:02:45.832 --> 01:02:47.832
Oh!

01:02:48.968 --> 01:02:52.336
Ian. Great.
I've really missed you.

01:02:52.338 --> 01:02:54.504
Is Charlotte all right? Look,

01:02:54.506 --> 01:02:57.507
if something dramatic has
happened, it should be on film.

01:02:57.509 --> 01:03:00.943
I have a shoot tomorrow which
I was unable to prepare for...

01:03:00.945 --> 01:03:03.278
Because I was trapped
in the bathroom all day...

01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:05.780
By his son's pet spider.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:09.416
So I'll be spending the night at
the loft to make up for lost time.

01:03:09.418 --> 01:03:13.286
So, the appearance of little mowgli
is straining the relationship?

01:03:13.288 --> 01:03:15.821
Ian, you're furniture,
and furniture doesn't talk.

01:03:15.823 --> 01:03:20.058
Furniture may not talk, Michael, but
it listens, better than you do.

01:03:20.060 --> 01:03:24.062
I'm an artist, Michael. You look
at something and see what it is.

01:03:24.064 --> 01:03:26.531
I look at something
and see what it can be...

01:03:26.533 --> 01:03:29.000
And who can wear it.

01:03:29.002 --> 01:03:31.402
Charlotte. Y...

01:03:36.809 --> 01:03:39.409
you all right?

01:03:39.411 --> 01:03:43.813
Charlotte's mad.
She doesn't like me.

01:03:43.815 --> 01:03:48.216
No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Come on.
It's not you at all. It's me.

01:03:48.218 --> 01:03:51.319
She's afraid of change.

01:03:51.321 --> 01:03:55.256
Why did paliku
leave you, baboon?

01:03:55.258 --> 01:03:57.257
Boy, um...

01:04:00.195 --> 01:04:03.863
I probably took her for granted.

01:04:03.865 --> 01:04:06.365
So, n-now you're with Charlotte.

01:04:06.367 --> 01:04:09.067
Yes, I am.

01:04:09.069 --> 01:04:11.269
Many females
in your village, baboon.

01:04:11.271 --> 01:04:14.805
- Mm-hmm.
- Why you pick only one?

01:04:17.442 --> 01:04:20.976
Well, when you pick one to love,
it's very different.

01:04:22.579 --> 01:04:27.582
It's like there's a big picture of her
in front of your face at all times.

01:04:27.584 --> 01:04:32.252
And the picture's so big
you can't see any other females.

01:04:34.889 --> 01:04:37.890
Well, I try harder
to make Charlotte like me.

01:04:49.169 --> 01:04:51.903
- Hi.
- Hello, jan. You look nice today.

01:04:51.905 --> 01:04:55.072
Thank you.

01:04:55.074 --> 01:04:58.041
This is Mimi siku.

01:04:58.043 --> 01:05:02.378
Mimi, this is Mrs. kempster,
and I think you know Karen.

01:05:03.581 --> 01:05:05.847
- Isn't he adorable?
- Mom!

01:05:05.849 --> 01:05:08.516
- Hello, Mimi siku!
- Jan.

01:05:08.518 --> 01:05:11.318
I am so happy that
you've come to our house...

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:14.187
- Jan.
- In the country to spend the night!

01:05:14.189 --> 01:05:17.490
- Jan, he's not deaf.
- Although he might be now.

01:05:17.492 --> 01:05:20.526
I can't thank you enough
for lettin' him spend the night.

01:05:20.528 --> 01:05:23.028
I've really got to spend
some time with Charlotte.

01:05:23.030 --> 01:05:26.114
It's our pleasure.

01:05:26.115 --> 01:05:29.199
All right, everything he needs is in the
knapsack here. He sleeps in a hammock.

01:05:29.202 --> 01:05:31.268
It's in there, and he'll set it
up somewhere around the yard.

01:05:31.270 --> 01:05:34.271
- Okay!
- Is Richard home?

01:05:34.273 --> 01:05:36.506
He left early for the office.

01:05:36.508 --> 01:05:39.375
<i>Over in the comex,
coffee continues to plunge...</i>

01:05:39.377 --> 01:05:43.212
<i>From its high of 971/2
less than a week ago.</i>

01:05:43.214 --> 01:05:46.981
<i>In trading today, the price
of futures was at 68.5.</i>

01:05:50.386 --> 01:05:52.919
<i>The blue chip indicator
rose slightly...</i>

01:05:54.989 --> 01:05:56.989
<i>in other news, reactions were...</i>

01:05:58.325 --> 01:06:00.358
what kind of a dumb name
is Mimi siku?

01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:04.195
Don't be rude. He probably
thinks Andrew is a dumb name.

01:06:04.197 --> 01:06:06.564
So do I.

01:06:06.566 --> 01:06:09.532
- I think Mimi siku is a nice name.
- You would.

01:06:13.004 --> 01:06:15.437
These are my father's fish.

01:06:15.439 --> 01:06:20.975
That's a poe... poe... uh...

01:06:20.977 --> 01:06:25.678
it's a poecilia latipinna.
They're from the Amazon.

01:06:29.050 --> 01:06:31.316
- We call it <i> rishi.</i>
<i>- Rishi?</i>

01:06:31.318 --> 01:06:35.519
- Yeah.
- Oh. I like that name better.

01:06:37.923 --> 01:06:41.090
At least I can pronounce it.

01:06:45.029 --> 01:06:48.964
Oh! Hi. Do you like fish, Mimi?

01:06:48.966 --> 01:06:53.000
I'm cooking fish for lunch.

01:06:54.937 --> 01:06:57.570
- We call it <i> rishi.</i>
- Fish.

01:07:05.613 --> 01:07:07.946
Oh!

01:07:07.948 --> 01:07:10.615
This not fish. Not taste good.

01:07:10.617 --> 01:07:15.085
Well, it's frozen, Mimi.
You have to cook it first.

01:07:15.087 --> 01:07:18.655
Oh! Poor thing.

01:07:18.657 --> 01:07:22.658
'Kay now, be honest. Which do you like
best for the flower girl's dress?

01:07:24.061 --> 01:07:26.061
- Yeah?
- Michael, it's me!

01:07:26.063 --> 01:07:29.064
<i>Richard, not now. Charlotte
and I are just about to...</i>

01:07:29.066 --> 01:07:31.533
<i>look toward the kitchen.</i>

01:07:33.570 --> 01:07:37.004
Come here. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

01:07:37.006 --> 01:07:40.240
Great. Okay. All right,
Richard. Thanks. Bye.

01:07:42.410 --> 01:07:45.110
Excuse me just
for a second, please.

01:07:48.515 --> 01:07:51.115
- What? What? What?
- I made the deal.

01:07:51.117 --> 01:07:55.419
- What deal?
- Uh, with jovanovic.

01:07:55.421 --> 01:07:59.356
After you left, I made the deal.

01:07:59.358 --> 01:08:02.025
- Are you out of your mind?
- Yes, yes.

01:08:02.027 --> 01:08:04.895
I am, I am
out of my mind. Squid?

01:08:04.896 --> 01:08:07.764
No, no, no, no, no. H-how did you get the
certificates out of the vault without my signature?

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:10.767
- Well...
- You forged my signature?

01:08:10.769 --> 01:08:13.603
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was... I was
afraid that we would lose everything.

01:08:13.605 --> 01:08:18.140
- What did you do with the money?
- It's here. Here.

01:08:20.144 --> 01:08:23.678
You're walking around New York City
with a million dollars in a suitcase?

01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:27.747
Not so loud!
Would you... it's good.

01:08:27.750 --> 01:08:30.484
Hi. The worst part...

01:08:30.486 --> 01:08:33.487
- there's a worse part?
- Oh, yes, there is.

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:37.491
Coffee fell below 75
this morning.

01:08:37.493 --> 01:08:40.493
- Let me think. Let me think.
- Yes.

01:08:41.363 --> 01:08:43.763
Come on.

01:08:43.765 --> 01:08:47.700
We will go to jovanovic. Tell him we made
a big mistake. Give him the money back.

01:08:47.702 --> 01:08:50.769
But... Charlotte, hi.

01:08:50.770 --> 01:08:54.639
Richard! What are you
doing here?

01:08:54.640 --> 01:08:58.509
- There's a very big problem with the coffee trade.
- Don't tell me. You're leaving.

01:08:58.511 --> 01:09:02.211
- This is very important to me.
- And I'm not?

01:09:04.381 --> 01:09:06.546
Of course you're important.

01:09:06.549 --> 01:09:10.651
You are the most important thing
in the world to me,

01:09:10.653 --> 01:09:12.752
except for this other thing
I gotta do now.

01:09:12.755 --> 01:09:15.154
This better be an emergency.

01:09:15.157 --> 01:09:18.224
It is. We're gonna die.

01:09:18.225 --> 01:09:21.493
Does anyone know where Mimi is?

01:09:21.495 --> 01:09:23.828
Mom, Mimi's doin' something bad.

01:09:25.096 --> 01:09:27.096
Oh!

01:09:28.366 --> 01:09:32.568
Well, um, isn't that
interesting?

01:09:32.569 --> 01:09:36.104
Me cook real fish. You taste?

01:09:36.106 --> 01:09:38.606
Try everything once,
I always say.

01:09:38.608 --> 01:09:41.642
Oh. Hot. Okay.

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:44.578
That is very tasty.
Where'd you get the fish?

01:09:44.581 --> 01:09:47.247
Mom, Tarzan's eating
daddy's fish.

01:09:47.250 --> 01:09:49.216
House pond.

01:09:52.453 --> 01:09:54.921
House pond?

01:09:54.923 --> 01:09:57.423
- We'll manage to survive this, okay?
- Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.

01:09:57.425 --> 01:09:59.625
- I got kids to feed.
- So do I!

01:09:59.627 --> 01:10:01.627
Yeah, but mine want
nike and Nintendo.

01:10:01.629 --> 01:10:04.396
Yours wants blowguns
and meow mix.

01:10:06.867 --> 01:10:10.201
Beluga. Best caviar
in whole world.

01:10:10.203 --> 01:10:12.369
- Oh, yes, yes. Bar none, the best.
- Oh, it's delicious. Very tasty.

01:10:12.371 --> 01:10:14.704
- Yes. Uh-huh.
- It's very good.

01:10:14.706 --> 01:10:16.906
- Taste. - No, not without toast points.
- No, thanks.

01:10:16.908 --> 01:10:18.807
- Gotta have toast points and capers.
- Tempting, tempting.

01:10:18.809 --> 01:10:20.809
- Taste!
- Yeah, all right. Look at that.

01:10:20.811 --> 01:10:22.977
- Right out of the fish. Mmm!
- Mmm!

01:10:22.979 --> 01:10:24.845
- Mmm! Mmm!
- Mmm!

01:10:24.847 --> 01:10:26.980
- Oh, it's so fishy.
- Very fishy.

01:10:26.982 --> 01:10:28.915
- With egg...
- Eggy, fishy.

01:10:31.619 --> 01:10:35.854
Morrison tell me
coffee now below 70, no?

01:10:35.856 --> 01:10:38.590
We were as shocked as you are.

01:10:38.592 --> 01:10:41.926
- Ow!
- Much lower than 75.

01:10:41.928 --> 01:10:44.895
We think it was wrong
to sell you the coffee futures.

01:10:44.897 --> 01:10:47.864
- We want to buy them back.
- How much?

01:10:47.866 --> 01:10:50.967
The same. A million dollars.

01:10:50.969 --> 01:10:53.869
You lose money.

01:10:53.871 --> 01:10:56.638
Oh, don't worry about that.

01:10:56.640 --> 01:10:59.841
W-we value your friendship
is what it is.

01:10:59.843 --> 01:11:01.843
And our fingers.

01:11:03.446 --> 01:11:07.247
- Very good.
- I do not know.

01:11:07.249 --> 01:11:09.983
Wh-what's not to know?
Y-y-you're cleaning up here.

01:11:09.985 --> 01:11:13.419
You are shrewd men.

01:11:13.421 --> 01:11:16.488
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Believe me,

01:11:16.490 --> 01:11:19.790
shrewdness is not
in the picture.

01:11:22.995 --> 01:11:25.428
I told you.
Time heals everything.

01:11:25.430 --> 01:11:27.730
It just...
oh, the door's locked.

01:11:27.732 --> 01:11:31.834
W-well, that's a statement,
I guess. Okay, so...

01:11:31.836 --> 01:11:36.638
I'll keep these certificates
at my house and...

01:11:36.640 --> 01:11:40.808
don't worry about me. I'm sure
there's a train I can take.

01:11:40.810 --> 01:11:43.477
It's not like it's a dangerous
neighborhood or anything.

01:11:44.613 --> 01:11:46.746
Hi. How ya doin'?

01:11:48.916 --> 01:11:51.950
And this is supposed
to be a bribe?

01:11:51.952 --> 01:11:54.786
Is it working?

01:11:54.788 --> 01:11:58.022
It's pretty effective.

01:11:58.024 --> 01:12:00.557
I'll get some champagne.

01:12:00.559 --> 01:12:03.560
And I'll change into
something more comfortable.

01:12:48.373 --> 01:12:51.474
Huh?

01:12:51.476 --> 01:12:55.377
Oh, no. Oh, girl,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:12:55.379 --> 01:12:58.380
I didn't mean to do that.
It was an accident.

01:12:58.382 --> 01:13:00.915
Come on.

01:13:03.986 --> 01:13:08.655
Coco, coco. Come on. Coco? Coco?

01:13:08.657 --> 01:13:11.724
Michael, I was thinking about
taking tomorrow morning off.

01:13:11.726 --> 01:13:14.927
Yes, that... oh, that's a great
idea. Whatever you'd like to do.

01:13:14.929 --> 01:13:18.764
'Cause then it would... it would just be...
it would just be you and me, wouldn't it?

01:13:18.766 --> 01:13:21.600
Coco? Coco, coco.

01:13:22.669 --> 01:13:26.003
Here. Snap out of it. Come on.

01:13:26.005 --> 01:13:28.839
Come on, coco.
You're killing me. Wake up!

01:13:28.841 --> 01:13:32.108
Coco, what's that?
It's a mouse! Go get it!

01:13:32.110 --> 01:13:34.610
Oh.

01:13:34.612 --> 01:13:39.147
Coco, coco, coco. Coco? Coco?

01:13:57.032 --> 01:14:01.034
- Jan!
- Now, where is this champagne?

01:14:01.036 --> 01:14:05.104
Let's go in the kitchen.
You're so feisty today.

01:14:05.106 --> 01:14:08.640
It's so nice to see you and coco
getting along so well.

01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:11.743
She's so fast. Oh!

01:14:11.745 --> 01:14:14.178
What do you say we take
the champagne...

01:14:14.180 --> 01:14:16.746
And drink it in the bedroom?

01:14:19.784 --> 01:14:22.651
So, uh, let me just
get this clear in my head.

01:14:22.653 --> 01:14:24.786
Y-you... you thought what?
That I wouldn't notice?

01:14:24.788 --> 01:14:27.722
Those fish cost me
thousands of dollars!

01:14:27.724 --> 01:14:32.059
I think what we have here is an
intercultural misunderstanding.

01:14:32.061 --> 01:14:35.762
Oh, well, why don't you tell that
to my yellow dwarf cichlids?

01:14:35.764 --> 01:14:38.765
- Because they can't hear anymore!
- Fish taste good.

01:14:38.767 --> 01:14:43.835
Well, let's hope so, Mimi. 'Cause you
just downed $10,000 worth of Sushi.

01:14:43.837 --> 01:14:47.170
There's still one left.

01:14:48.606 --> 01:14:50.606
Winky.

01:14:51.909 --> 01:14:53.909
My most loyal fish.

01:14:55.913 --> 01:15:00.114
Remember how he used to always
follow my finger across the glass?

01:15:03.085 --> 01:15:05.652
Now I'm gonna
have to go like this.

01:15:05.654 --> 01:15:08.521
Everybody, go to bed.
It's late. Give me this.

01:15:08.523 --> 01:15:10.523
- No. Uh-uh.
- Yes. Come on, sweetheart.

01:15:10.525 --> 01:15:13.659
All right, keep it.
Mimi, you go to bed too.

01:15:13.661 --> 01:15:15.661
- It's just... you know, I mean...
- Okay. Come on. Come on.

01:15:15.663 --> 01:15:18.096
- It's one thing to...
- Come on.

01:15:18.098 --> 01:15:21.099
I... you've no idea
what this kind of...

01:15:21.101 --> 01:15:23.101
yes, I know.

01:16:24.063 --> 01:16:26.663
Wait.

01:16:26.665 --> 01:16:28.898
Wait.

01:16:28.900 --> 01:16:31.700
Wait. Now.

01:16:41.044 --> 01:16:43.244
You pinare now.

01:16:45.648 --> 01:16:49.282
- Choose a name.
- Choose for me.

01:16:53.054 --> 01:16:56.554
- Ukume.
- What?

01:16:58.891 --> 01:17:01.892
- Ukume.
- What does it mean?

01:17:04.029 --> 01:17:09.565
It means "sound of, of rain
on river water."

01:17:10.768 --> 01:17:14.136
Ukume. It's pretty.

01:17:59.015 --> 01:18:03.083
Jan! Jan!

01:18:03.085 --> 01:18:05.085
You're goin' to camp.
End of discussion.

01:18:05.087 --> 01:18:08.121
- Dad! But, mom, we didn't do anything.
- Not understand problem.

01:18:08.123 --> 01:18:10.356
Look, I'll tell you
the problem, Mimi.

01:18:10.358 --> 01:18:14.626
You started a wildfire in my yard,
you ate my yellow dwarf cichlid...

01:18:14.628 --> 01:18:17.228
And now you're putting the moves
on my 12-year-old daughter.

01:18:17.230 --> 01:18:20.030
- Okay?
- But that's just not true.

01:18:20.032 --> 01:18:22.899
Oh, well, there. See? See? Maybe
you're overreacting, Richard.

01:18:22.901 --> 01:18:26.702
- I was putting the moves on him.
- Tell me I didn't hear that.

01:18:26.704 --> 01:18:29.971
Well, now, honey, honey, maybe
we should be very grateful...

01:18:29.973 --> 01:18:32.707
- That this happened at home.
- Mom!

01:18:32.709 --> 01:18:34.942
- Hold on!
- Mom, nothing happened!

01:18:34.944 --> 01:18:37.678
Well, you know what, Karen?
You're still goin' to camp.

01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:40.213
- An all-girls camp.
- Yes!

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:43.316
My name's not Karen anymore.
It's ukume.

01:18:43.318 --> 01:18:45.418
First dibs on ukume's room.

01:18:47.422 --> 01:18:51.423
Oh, now, this makes me feel
a whole lot better!

01:18:54.227 --> 01:18:57.061
Karen? Karen, honey?

01:18:57.063 --> 01:18:58.929
I-I still don't
understand the problem.

01:18:58.931 --> 01:19:01.131
No, Mimi, not now.
He might bite you.

01:19:01.133 --> 01:19:04.734
- Hello? -<i> Richard, it's morrison.</i>
- Come on. Come on.

01:19:04.736 --> 01:19:06.969
- Yeah?
- Let's just go away.

01:19:06.971 --> 01:19:10.205
- I just had another visit from jovanovic.
- Yeah?

01:19:10.207 --> 01:19:15.109
- Oh-h-h, then you haven't seen what's happening this morning?
- S-seen what?

01:19:15.111 --> 01:19:18.011
Price of coffee, soaring.

01:19:18.013 --> 01:19:20.246
And jovanovic thinks
you screwed him.

01:19:20.248 --> 01:19:23.449
<i>He may be coming by
for the certificates.</i>

01:19:23.451 --> 01:19:26.752
You mean he's angry?

01:19:26.754 --> 01:19:29.354
Boy, coco, you slept
like a log last night.

01:19:29.356 --> 01:19:31.723
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

01:19:31.725 --> 01:19:35.093
How would you feel about
Mimi being in the wedding?

01:19:35.095 --> 01:19:39.197
I thought he was
gonna be gone by then.

01:19:39.199 --> 01:19:42.433
- Remember, it's just you and me this morning.
- I remember.

01:19:42.435 --> 01:19:46.003
- No, business, no Mimi.
- What is it, Richard? I can't...

01:19:46.005 --> 01:19:48.705
stop, stop, stop, stop. What?

01:19:50.308 --> 01:19:54.276
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Don't panic, please.

01:19:54.278 --> 01:19:57.778
Now, should we go out for breakfast,
or do you think we should stay in?

01:19:59.248 --> 01:20:01.314
Michael?

01:20:01.316 --> 01:20:03.482
Okay, everybody!
Change of plans!

01:20:03.484 --> 01:20:06.451
Jan, you take everyone out
for a big breakfast!

01:20:06.453 --> 01:20:09.287
And bring a change of clothes!

01:20:13.726 --> 01:20:16.126
- I told you.
- Karen, we don't have time for this, honey.

01:20:16.128 --> 01:20:18.328
I'm not goin'
to an all-girls camp!

01:20:18.330 --> 01:20:20.496
Karen, open this door
right now! Do you hear me?

01:20:20.498 --> 01:20:24.399
Calm down. What is going on?

01:20:26.136 --> 01:20:30.838
- ...a big knife!
- Karen, open the door right this minute!

01:20:30.840 --> 01:20:32.973
You get the car ready.
I'll take care of her, okay?

01:20:32.975 --> 01:20:35.976
- Go! Go! Please, please! Go! Go!
- All right, all right.

01:20:35.978 --> 01:20:38.511
Andrew, clear the door.

01:20:43.450 --> 01:20:46.784
Cool.

01:20:48.154 --> 01:20:51.388
Karen! Open this door.

01:20:51.390 --> 01:20:55.258
Karen, open this door right now!
Do you hear me?

01:20:55.260 --> 01:20:59.195
- Your father's very mad.
- I'm not coming out!

01:21:11.808 --> 01:21:14.475
- I'll get some matches. We'll smoke her out.
- Andrew, get back here!

01:21:14.477 --> 01:21:19.346
I can handle this. Karen, this is
getting really, really boring!

01:21:20.315 --> 01:21:22.815
Open it! Come on!

01:21:22.817 --> 01:21:25.017
- Any word from the Russians?
- Not yet. No, no.

01:21:25.019 --> 01:21:27.185
- Karen, open up!
- What's goin' on?

01:21:27.187 --> 01:21:29.954
Karen has locked herself
in the bedroom. Okay?

01:21:29.956 --> 01:21:33.424
Come on, honey. Open this door,
or you know what's gonna happen?

01:21:33.426 --> 01:21:36.059
Andrew is gonna smoke you out!
How about that?

01:21:36.061 --> 01:21:38.027
- Cool!
- I am kidding. Get back here.

01:21:38.029 --> 01:21:40.863
Calm down. Please, calm down.
Where's Mimi?

01:21:40.865 --> 01:21:44.099
Uh, Mimi? I don't know. He's probably in
a bar hitting on a cocktail waitress.

01:21:44.101 --> 01:21:46.401
- What?
- Karen! Your son just spent the night...

01:21:46.403 --> 01:21:49.404
In his hammock
with my daughter, okay?

01:21:49.406 --> 01:21:52.106
- Was there a pot involved?
- No, there was no pot involved.

01:21:52.108 --> 01:21:55.175
- You have nothing to be upset about, then.
- There is nothing to be upset about?

01:21:55.177 --> 01:21:59.513
- No!
- Come here. There's no reason to be upset, huh?

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:04.384
Well, how about the fact that your son ate
my prizewinning fish, including winky?

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:06.686
And the fact that the Russian
mafia is due here any moment.

01:22:06.688 --> 01:22:09.121
I guess you're right.

01:22:11.291 --> 01:22:13.624
That's a pain
that's here to stay.

01:22:13.626 --> 01:22:16.226
Richard, screaming's no way
to deal with a child, all right?

01:22:16.228 --> 01:22:19.229
Oh, what? Are you suddenly Dr. Spock here?
You've been a father for three days.

01:22:19.231 --> 01:22:22.165
- And you're giving me lessons? That's good.
- You sound like an idiot.

01:22:22.167 --> 01:22:24.500
I'm a parent;
Therefore, I'm an idiot.

01:22:24.502 --> 01:22:27.369
I have spent every day for the last
12 years worrying about my kids.

01:22:27.371 --> 01:22:30.305
About their safety, about their
happiness, about their crooked teeth.

01:22:30.307 --> 01:22:32.373
- No offense, Andrew.
- None taken.

01:22:32.375 --> 01:22:34.208
But of course none of this
means anything to you,

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.410
because in the next few days
your son will be gone.

01:22:36.412 --> 01:22:39.646
Open this door! Karen!

01:22:39.648 --> 01:22:43.149
Open up! I've gotta
get her out of here.

01:22:43.151 --> 01:22:46.352
Look, two shoulders are better
than one, right? Come on.

01:22:46.354 --> 01:22:49.355
Baboon is here. He make peace.

01:22:59.666 --> 01:23:01.632
All right!

01:23:02.968 --> 01:23:06.469
- Oh!
- Ohh.

01:23:06.471 --> 01:23:11.106
- Awesome fall, dad.
- Thank you, Andrew.

01:23:11.108 --> 01:23:15.343
Okay, we gotta get jan and the kids into
the car before jovanovic gets here.

01:23:15.345 --> 01:23:18.446
Andrew, meet me downstairs.

01:23:18.448 --> 01:23:22.383
- You okay, daddy?
- Yeah, I'm fine. L-l-let me lean on you, honey. Ow.

01:23:22.385 --> 01:23:26.286
- Mimi, come on downstairs.
- Coming.

01:23:28.056 --> 01:23:31.323
Anybody can land on their feet.

01:23:31.325 --> 01:23:33.391
- Okay, Andrew, let's go! Let's go. We're going.
- Where are we going?

01:23:33.393 --> 01:23:36.033
- Wh... uh, the... French toast sale going on.
- What's the matter?

01:23:39.231 --> 01:23:41.330
Good morning.

01:23:44.668 --> 01:23:47.101
Sorry.

01:23:51.407 --> 01:23:53.407
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:23:53.409 --> 01:23:57.544
Give me coffee certificates.

01:23:57.546 --> 01:24:02.315
We-well, you don't think that I would keep
certificates like that around my house, would you?

01:24:02.317 --> 01:24:07.086
- Don't make me lose temper.
- Ow. Ow. Ow.

01:24:07.088 --> 01:24:10.756
- Dad keeps everything I-in the bookcase.
- Andrew! Ow.

01:24:10.758 --> 01:24:13.391
Behind the Bible
and Judith krantz.

01:24:13.393 --> 01:24:16.527
Thank you, Andrew.

01:24:25.637 --> 01:24:28.638
Oh.<i> Scruples.</i>

01:24:29.641 --> 01:24:32.307
Could not put it down.

01:24:35.111 --> 01:24:37.644
Oh.

01:24:37.646 --> 01:24:41.514
All right, so, so, uh,
you have your certificates,

01:24:41.516 --> 01:24:45.217
and I would appreciate it if you would
just take them and leave my house.

01:24:45.219 --> 01:24:48.687
- Sit.
- Sure.

01:24:48.689 --> 01:24:53.658
First, I teach you never
to make fool of jovanovic again.

01:24:53.660 --> 01:24:56.260
Rope him down.

01:24:57.529 --> 01:25:00.263
"Rope him down"?

01:25:00.265 --> 01:25:02.298
I have an idea.

01:25:04.201 --> 01:25:06.568
- You'll need these.
- What? What?

01:25:13.843 --> 01:25:18.145
Ow! C-couldn't we discuss this
over a lovely cup of coffee?

01:25:18.147 --> 01:25:20.580
- Quiet!
- Or jan could whip up some borscht.

01:25:20.582 --> 01:25:23.082
- You make a fool of jovanovic.
- No.

01:25:23.084 --> 01:25:25.484
In front of my comrades,
my community.

01:25:25.486 --> 01:25:29.287
You waste my time.
You try to cheat me.

01:25:29.289 --> 01:25:33.090
- Oh!
- Now you must pay.

01:25:34.093 --> 01:25:37.260
Sit still, coward!

01:25:37.262 --> 01:25:40.096
Now, I teach you...

01:25:40.098 --> 01:25:44.599
Never, never to make a fool
of jovanovic again.

01:25:47.136 --> 01:25:49.603
Eeny?

01:25:49.605 --> 01:25:52.138
- Meeny?
- Mm-mm.

01:25:52.140 --> 01:25:55.141
Miney? No. Need
that one for traffic.

01:25:55.143 --> 01:25:56.675
Mo.

01:26:10.423 --> 01:26:13.824
Huh? What?

01:26:16.428 --> 01:26:19.662
Spider! Oh, I hate spiders!

01:26:19.664 --> 01:26:23.332
Kill spider! Kill spider
quickly! Not me! Spider!

01:26:23.334 --> 01:26:25.367
Don't move!
The spider will kill you!

01:26:25.369 --> 01:26:27.836
Kill spider. Shoot.
Shoot, boy. Go ahead.

01:26:27.838 --> 01:26:30.572
Don't worry about mess!

01:26:30.574 --> 01:26:34.542
- Get him, Mimi!
- I'm coming, daddy!

01:26:39.482 --> 01:26:41.715
Help me!

01:26:41.717 --> 01:26:45.452
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

01:26:45.454 --> 01:26:48.188
- Get away!
- Don't you do that to my son!

01:26:48.190 --> 01:26:50.690
Show 'em what
the kempsters are made of!

01:26:51.893 --> 01:26:55.628
Bite him, Andrew!
Use those crooked teeth!

01:26:57.231 --> 01:26:58.830
Crap!

01:27:00.733 --> 01:27:02.899
Shoot again, baboon!
Shoot again!

01:27:10.407 --> 01:27:12.874
Good boy, Andrew!

01:27:20.683 --> 01:27:23.282
Daddy?

01:27:26.720 --> 01:27:28.753
Don't shoot.

01:27:54.813 --> 01:27:58.413
Baboon, when thumb doesn't work,
pinare do this.

01:28:01.551 --> 01:28:05.286
Oh, that's gotta hurt. Oh!

01:28:10.693 --> 01:28:13.860
I'm startin' to really
like that spider.

01:28:18.266 --> 01:28:21.333
Please, please, don't point
spider at me any longer!

01:28:21.335 --> 01:28:23.501
I'm going. I'm going.

01:28:25.972 --> 01:28:29.673
I have many enemies,
but none like that spider.

01:28:29.675 --> 01:28:32.475
Drive!

01:28:40.484 --> 01:28:43.485
Karen, time to come
inside, baby!

01:28:48.325 --> 01:28:50.892
I want you to have this.

01:28:58.801 --> 01:29:01.868
Well, Mimi,
here's all your stuff.

01:29:01.870 --> 01:29:05.437
Better get goin', huh?
Your dad's waiting.

01:29:07.374 --> 01:29:10.641
Bye, Michael. Bye, Mimi.

01:29:23.422 --> 01:29:27.323
Come on. I'm gonna
take you someplace.

01:29:46.443 --> 01:29:49.544
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

01:29:49.546 --> 01:29:51.812
Come here. Come on.

01:29:54.983 --> 01:29:59.652
Last time I was here,
I bought that for your mom.

01:30:03.891 --> 01:30:06.825
I want to go back home.

01:30:06.827 --> 01:30:09.761
- You sick?
- No.

01:30:09.763 --> 01:30:11.796
You sure?

01:30:13.499 --> 01:30:16.800
All right. Um, but we gotta come
back here in a couple of days.

01:30:16.802 --> 01:30:19.336
Tell you why. Fourth of July.

01:30:19.337 --> 01:30:21.871
It's like that <i> fanenteyou</i> celebration
of yours, but here it's big.

01:30:21.873 --> 01:30:24.840
There's boats everywhere that you
can see and thousands of people.

01:30:24.842 --> 01:30:29.577
And at night, they... they shoot off
fire in the sky like you've never seen.

01:30:29.579 --> 01:30:32.379
I failed the chief, baboon.

01:30:32.381 --> 01:30:34.581
How did you fail the chief?

01:30:34.583 --> 01:30:37.584
Didn't get the fire
from the statue of liberty.

01:30:37.586 --> 01:30:39.586
The fire isn't real.

01:30:39.588 --> 01:30:42.822
Well, the fire's in here.

01:30:42.824 --> 01:30:45.357
Chief knows that.

01:30:46.893 --> 01:30:48.926
I miss paliku.

01:30:50.496 --> 01:30:52.828
I want to go back home.

01:30:55.098 --> 01:30:57.098
Home.

01:31:02.538 --> 01:31:04.538
All right.

01:31:25.394 --> 01:31:28.395
Ouch. Oh, almost forgot.

01:31:29.698 --> 01:31:32.865
- You'll be needin' this.
- You keep it.

01:31:32.867 --> 01:31:35.801
- No, Mimi. Here. Mimi. Come on. Come on. Come on. Here. Here.
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:31:35.803 --> 01:31:40.138
If you kill a fly,
you will be a real pinare.

01:31:40.140 --> 01:31:43.741
Yeah, like that's gonna happen.

01:31:43.743 --> 01:31:46.009
You know, I will practice.

01:31:46.011 --> 01:31:49.178
That way I can come down
and hunt with you.

01:31:52.550 --> 01:31:55.150
You'll never come to lipo lipo.

01:31:55.152 --> 01:31:57.919
<i>American airlines announces
the final boarding call...</i>

01:31:57.921 --> 01:32:00.788
<i>For flight 935
to caracas, Venezuela.</i>

01:32:00.790 --> 01:32:03.674
- Time to go.
- <i> Gate 48.</i>

01:32:03.675 --> 01:32:06.559
- <i> All passengers should be on the airplane now.</i>
- Thanks for the blowgun.

01:32:06.562 --> 01:32:08.695
Mimi, I got you somethin'.

01:32:08.697 --> 01:32:11.898
It's for you, but I want you
to open it in the plane.

01:32:11.900 --> 01:32:16.936
Don't open it now.
I also got you this.

01:32:29.149 --> 01:32:31.149
Fire from statue.

01:32:31.151 --> 01:32:35.085
Fire from statue.
Pretty cool, huh?

01:32:36.721 --> 01:32:38.921
Be careful with it though.

01:32:48.832 --> 01:32:51.065
<i>Wakatepe?</i>

01:32:52.001 --> 01:32:54.001
<i>Wakatepe.</i>

01:34:15.016 --> 01:34:18.318
Charlie, I got a great idea.

01:34:18.320 --> 01:34:22.055
What do you say you and I
get the hell outta here?

01:34:22.057 --> 01:34:25.425
Tomorrow. Just the two of us.
Head out to our favorite spa.

01:34:25.427 --> 01:34:27.860
That big suite. Just
get to know each other again.

01:34:27.862 --> 01:34:30.996
- That's not good for me, darling.
- Me neither.

01:34:30.998 --> 01:34:34.165
I really want to film all that,

01:34:34.167 --> 01:34:38.068
but I've got an appointment with
my chiropractor this weekend.

01:34:38.070 --> 01:34:40.170
You know how much my bloody back
affects my whole work.

01:34:40.172 --> 01:34:44.274
- Oh, I know.
- We could do it a week Friday.

01:34:44.276 --> 01:34:48.278
- That's not good for me.
- It's good for Ian.

01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:51.347
- Well, whatever's good for Ian.
- I-I suggest we go for a following Wednesday.

01:34:51.349 --> 01:34:53.349
Wednesdays are good.

01:35:13.771 --> 01:35:17.939
Cromwell! Cromwell, coffee's
up another two points.

01:35:17.941 --> 01:35:20.274
My boys, I never
doubted you for a minute.

01:35:20.276 --> 01:35:22.276
What do you say we go down
to the trading floor...

01:35:22.278 --> 01:35:24.244
With those certificates
and make us some money?

01:35:24.246 --> 01:35:26.946
Money is honey.

01:35:31.351 --> 01:35:33.951
Look at those prices!

01:35:33.953 --> 01:35:36.720
Boys, we're gonna clean up!

01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:53.368
- Did I ever tell you about cocoa in '73?
- Many times.

01:35:53.370 --> 01:35:57.171
Oh, there I was
with 800 pounds of cocoa...

01:35:57.173 --> 01:36:00.941
Back in the days before
greed became a dirty word.

01:36:00.943 --> 01:36:05.011
Now, I don't have to explain
that to you, my boy.

01:36:05.013 --> 01:36:07.146
You're a professional.

01:36:07.148 --> 01:36:11.750
But that cromwell, he's
a disaster waiting to happen.

01:36:11.752 --> 01:36:13.885
I don't know what's
going on with him.

01:36:13.887 --> 01:36:17.421
Between me and you,
cromwell has become...

01:36:17.423 --> 01:36:20.957
A colossal pain in the...

01:36:35.873 --> 01:36:38.473
yes!

01:36:39.542 --> 01:36:43.110
- Yes!
- Uh, George?

01:36:43.112 --> 01:36:47.880
Uh, get him something.
Michael, where you goin'?

01:36:47.882 --> 01:36:50.549
"And not only did he learn by..."

01:36:50.551 --> 01:36:54.352
- "experience."
- "Experience, but...

01:36:54.354 --> 01:36:56.253
- "Instincts...
- Good.

01:36:56.255 --> 01:36:59.789
Long dead, became alive again."

01:37:11.868 --> 01:37:14.101
- Baboon?
- <i> I nailed a fly.</i>

01:37:14.103 --> 01:37:16.470
- No!
- <i> You don't believe me. I'll show you.</i>

01:37:16.472 --> 01:37:19.172
- When?
- <i> Right now.</i>

01:37:26.547 --> 01:37:30.314
Baboon! Baboon!

01:37:31.984 --> 01:37:34.050
Baboon!

01:37:41.491 --> 01:37:43.958
Man, look at you.

01:37:43.960 --> 01:37:46.327
Oh, whoa, whoa, oh, oh, oh.

01:37:55.036 --> 01:37:58.570
Now you're a pinare, baboon.

01:37:58.572 --> 01:38:02.307
Will you stay with me
in lipo lipo?

01:38:02.309 --> 01:38:07.211
For a while. If you
teach me how to hunt.

01:38:07.213 --> 01:38:10.547
Oh. Got you something.

01:38:10.549 --> 01:38:13.149
Maybe you can use this.

01:38:15.219 --> 01:38:17.852
The real deal.

01:38:19.956 --> 01:38:22.022
How's Karen?

01:38:22.024 --> 01:38:25.291
I don't know. Why don't you
ask her yourself?

01:38:30.197 --> 01:38:32.530
Now that's a very big bug.

01:38:32.532 --> 01:38:36.934
Um, honey, this isn't one
of those topless tribes, is it?

01:38:36.936 --> 01:38:38.936
Don't even think
about that, Andrew.

01:38:38.938 --> 01:38:42.606
I can't, dad. I'm too nauseous
from the boat ride.

01:38:42.608 --> 01:38:47.443
Ukume! Ukume!

01:38:47.445 --> 01:38:51.079
Mimi! Mimi!

01:38:51.081 --> 01:38:54.148
- Karen!
- Karen!

01:38:59.488 --> 01:39:02.121
I thought I'd never
see you again.

01:39:45.565 --> 01:39:48.999
Looks too hot. Too hot.

01:40:09.487 --> 01:40:12.187
Look at my hand!

01:40:12.189 --> 01:40:14.656
<i>Mmm, it starts in the heart</i>

01:40:14.658 --> 01:40:17.392

<i>mmm, it starts in the heart</i>

01:40:20.163 --> 01:40:22.630
<i>mmm</i>

01:40:22.632 --> 01:40:25.332
<i>brick by brick
and stone by stone</i>

01:40:25.334 --> 01:40:28.968
<i>we all find a way
to build a wall</i>

01:40:33.207 --> 01:40:36.041
<i>and all they get is more alone</i>

01:40:36.043 --> 01:40:39.543
<i>can you see the stones
have got to fall</i>

01:40:41.113 --> 01:40:43.346
<i>oh, yeah</i>

01:40:43.348 --> 01:40:46.182
<i>we can let them stand</i>

01:40:46.184 --> 01:40:48.617
<i>but then nobody wins</i>

01:40:48.619 --> 01:40:51.319

<i>I look at you you look at me</i>

<i>can't you see that
I am on your side</i>

01:41:39.794 --> 01:41:42.427

01:41:52.638 --> 01:41:55.605
<i>and it isn't always clear.</i>

01:41:55.607 --> 01:41:58.341
<i>I know there's some way</i>

01:41:58.343 --> 01:42:01.344
