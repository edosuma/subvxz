What's really crazy is I was
actually here on Season 23.

Honestly, the no chair turn,

28:15.070 --> 28:17.197
I definitely
struggled with that.

28:17.238 --> 28:19.324
I would sit in my mom
and my dad's room

28:19.366 --> 28:20.492
and I would cry,

28:20.533 --> 28:22.994
and I thought that
because of that moment

28:23.036 --> 28:26.414
that I wasn't ever going
to be where I wanted.

of disappointments,

28:30.335 --> 28:33.505

of how strong she is

28:33.546 --> 28:37.300
and that she always continues
to just move forward.

28:37.342 --> 28:39.386
What makes me emotional
is knowing

28:39.427 --> 28:41.388
that I'm making
my parents proud,

28:41.429 --> 28:44.933
showing them, like, "Hey, I
learned it from you," you know?

28:44.974 --> 28:47.185
That is what drives me.

back and it might work out."

When you just said you're 18,
I can't believe that.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.285
Anything else
you want to add, bud?

37:25.120 --> 37:28.081
Me and my brother were adopted
by my mom and dad.

37:28.123 --> 37:30.000
We both have autism.

37:30.041 --> 37:32.252

of the spectrum,

37:32.293 --> 37:33.878

My brother Dawson, he is on
the lower end of the spectrum.

37:36.881 --> 37:39.676
I'm able to do a lot of things
that my brother can't.

37:39.718 --> 37:42.554

The black one or this one?

37:42.595 --> 37:45.181
Both.
You want 'em both?

37:45.223 --> 37:46.975
All right, looks like
we're gonna get them both.

37:47.017 --> 37:50.103
Me and my brother
have a deep bond in music.

37:50.145 --> 37:53.940
Growing up as a kid, he wasn't
able to talk clearly to us,

37:53.982 --> 37:57.944
so I would sing to my brother to
help try and stimulate his brain

37:57.986 --> 38:00.196
to get him to the point
where he could talk.

38:00.238 --> 38:02.407
I mean, it worked.
I mean, he's talking now.

38:02.449 --> 38:05.035
I love my brother, how he's
always been there for me

38:05.076 --> 38:06.494
ever since when
I was a baby,

38:06.536 --> 38:08.038
and I'm very proud
of him.

38:08.079 --> 38:10.874
You always have my support,
and I love you so much.

38:10.915 --> 38:14.419
Oh, my gosh.
I love you, too, buddy.

38:14.461 --> 38:16.963
I mean, he's like
my built-in best friend.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.674
We've been there for each other
through a lot.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.761
My dad passed away
when I was seven years old.

38:22.802 --> 38:24.346
I had epilepsy,

38:24.387 --> 38:27.724
so my mom and my dad would
take shifts sleeping with me,

38:27.766 --> 38:30.560
and it was
my dad's shift.

38:30.602 --> 38:33.355
And I woke up

38:33.396 --> 38:36.983
and I remember my dad just,
you know, laying there.

38:37.025 --> 38:39.611
Seeing these guys
grow up without a dad...

38:39.652 --> 38:41.237
I just did
the best I could.

38:41.279 --> 38:45.158
And then to see him here,
it's a dream come true.

38:45.200 --> 38:47.243
For the blind auditions,
I am singing

38:47.285 --> 38:49.954
"If Heaven Wasn't So Far Away"
by Justin Moore.

38:49.996 --> 38:52.624
It really connects to me
about the loss of my dad.

38:52.665 --> 38:54.834
If I could talk
to my dad again,

38:54.876 --> 38:56.878
I would just want to tell him
that I'm okay,

38:56.920 --> 38:58.755
that the family's okay,

38:58.797 --> 39:01.758
and that I'm doing my best
to take care of them

39:01.800 --> 39:03.635
and that I miss him

39:03.677 --> 39:06.429

I'm making him proud.

You took on one of the most
iconic soul songs,

01:04:56.771 --> 01:04:58.481
and I felt like
you were doing a lot

01:04:58.523 --> 01:05:00.608
when it came to runs
and things of that nature,

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:04.029

tell the story of the song

01:05:05.405 --> 01:05:07.949
The most magical moment
was that last "let"

when you let out that
big bellow, the "let."
Stunning. Gorgeous.

01:05:11.411 --> 01:05:12.912
It was like --
It was like a revelation.

to hear more of that."

Okay, I got it.

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:18.752
For me, your runs were pretty
good. It wasn't that.

01:05:18.793 --> 01:05:20.879
It was just they weren't
in the right spots.

My strategy for "The Voice"

is I want people on my team

what kind of music I sing,
