He's got [beep], bro!

37:15.608 --> 37:16.692
[both chuckling]

37:16.776 --> 37:19.528
{\an7}I'm exhausted,
but, uh, you can't be mad

37:19.612 --> 37:20.655
{\an8}when you wake up
to that though.

37:20.738 --> 37:22.657
{\an1}Ronnie!

37:22.740 --> 37:24.825
We seen a used condom.

37:24.909 --> 37:26.202
'Since when do you use those?'

37:26.285 --> 37:27.662
{\an1}Thought you guys
were trying.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.789
[all laughing]

37:32.124 --> 37:34.210
{\an7}Everybody's in a fabulous mood,
like, we're all just

37:34.293 --> 37:35.503
{\an8}so super excited to get home.

37:35.586 --> 37:38.923
{\an1}I love Italy, it's beautiful.
But I'm ready for Jersey.

37:39.006 --> 37:40.216
{\an1}I'm just happy we're all
going there in good spirits.

37:40.299 --> 37:44.220
I'm happy that we had
a good last two days.

37:44.303 --> 37:49.642
I was like contemplating
not going, but I'm going.

37:49.725 --> 37:52.979
{\an1}Who-- you know,
everything's all good.

37:53.062 --> 37:55.523
{\an4}<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>I know that Mike deep down</i>
<i>is a good person.</i>

37:55.606 --> 37:58.776
{\an7}<i>But Mike's personality is just</i>
<i>a hard one to deal with.</i>

37:58.859 --> 37:59.819
{\an8}What can I do?
But except accept it

37:59.902 --> 38:00.611
{\an8}and see what happens
in the future.

38:00.695 --> 38:03.322
{\an1}Show it!

38:03.406 --> 38:04.907
'Whoo!'

38:04.991 --> 38:06.033
Make a smile.

38:07.201 --> 38:10.246
- Aww.
- It's still there.

38:10.329 --> 38:12.456
<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>Jersey! Here I come.</i>

38:12.540 --> 38:15.084
{\an8}You know, I always got
something up my sleeve

38:15.167 --> 38:17.545
{\an8}and it's gonna be a situation.

38:17.628 --> 38:18.879
{\an1}(Pauly)
'I wanna do a cheers.'

38:18.963 --> 38:20.589
Here we go, Jersey.
Here we go, Jersey.

38:20.673 --> 38:22.174
{\an1}(Snooki)
'Let's go to Jersey, bitch!'

38:22.258 --> 38:23.300
[all cheering]

38:25.302 --> 38:26.804
{\an7}I'm real excited
to get back to seaside.

38:26.887 --> 38:28.723
{\an1}I can't wait to go tanning,
I'm gonna go tanning

38:28.806 --> 38:30.099
<i>then I'm gonna go tanning,</i>
<i>then I'm gonna go tanning</i>

38:30.182 --> 38:32.643
{\an7}then I'm gonna go to the gym
then I'm gonna do laundry.

38:32.727 --> 38:35.104
{\an8}G.T.L, I miss the most.

38:35.187 --> 38:36.063
DJ Pauly D, problems!

38:36.147 --> 38:38.524

Ow!

38:47.992 --> 38:49.076
[laughing]

38:49.160 --> 38:50.870
{\an1}<i>...Vinny and Pauly not</i>
<i>bringing home girls</i>

38:50.953 --> 38:51.912
{\an8}<i>I mean, this isn't real life.</i>

38:51.996 --> 38:54.040
{\an8}So in Jersey I think

38:54.123 --> 38:55.916
{\an8}everything's gonna
go back to normal.

38:56.000 --> 38:56.917
[whirring]

38:57.001 --> 38:59.920
{\an8}Oh, that felt weird.

39:00.004 --> 39:02.923
- Look at that. Oh!
- Yeah, buddy!

39:03.007 --> 39:05.468
{\an7}<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>My mother might be</i>
<i>a little disappointed</i>

39:05.551 --> 39:06.594
{\an7}that I'm not bringing back
a real, authentic

39:06.677 --> 39:09.221
{\an7}Italian wife home,
but that type of thing

39:09.305 --> 39:10.514
{\an8}<i>takes searching for.</i>

39:10.598 --> 39:11.724
{\an8}I'm still on the hunt.
We will meet someday.

39:11.807 --> 39:14.602
[both screaming]

39:15.436 --> 39:16.896
- Oh!
- Oh!

39:16.979 --> 39:19.857
{\an8}This house is kinda
like a foster home

39:19.940 --> 39:21.442
{\an8}with eight adopted children.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.694
<i>We fight, we argue,</i>
<i>but in the end</i>

39:23.778 --> 39:26.113
{\an7}everything always gets fixed
and we love each other.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.073
Ah!

39:27.156 --> 39:28.866

{\an1}<i>(Sammi)</i>
<i>Italy was really, really cool.</i>

39:33.204 --> 39:35.873
{\an7}<i>But Mike is such</i>

39:35.956 --> 39:37.666
{\an7}<i>It's like something I feel</i>
<i>like needs to be done</i>

39:37.750 --> 39:40.544
{\an7}before it escalates
into something crazy.

39:40.628 --> 39:42.797
{\an8}Yo, Ronnie said
only three more.

39:42.880 --> 39:44.298
{\an8}<i>(Mike)</i>
<i>I have no problem</i>

39:46.050 --> 39:48.135
{\an7}<i>I'm wild and I don't mind it,</i>
<i>you know.</i>

39:48.219 --> 39:49.095
{\an7}<i>Some of the others</i>
<i>just don't like drama.</i>
