00:10.478 --> 00:11.912
In prison they set you up!

00:12.046 --> 00:13.013
Who's they?

00:13.147 --> 00:14.482
- Pete.
- My Pete?

00:14.615 --> 00:15.983
He was afraid you'd flip.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.285
25 years, come on!

00:17.418 --> 00:18.752
Nobody does that kind of time.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.054
I did.

00:21.489 --> 00:22.856
Got sugar?

00:22.990 --> 00:25.526
No, we have, uh--
what do you call it-- Agave.

00:25.659 --> 00:27.461
What the fuck's that?

00:27.595 --> 00:30.531
You work for me now, understand?

00:30.664 --> 00:32.266
Go out there
and make some money.

00:32.400 --> 00:34.968
This is our territory.
Who gave you permission to sell?

00:37.638 --> 00:39.140
Black Macadam.

00:39.273 --> 00:40.641
Local biker gang.

00:40.774 --> 00:42.910
- They anything?
- Well, they ain't nothing.

00:44.278 --> 00:45.646
Let's go, my children.

00:45.779 --> 00:47.515
<i>The Art of War</i> states
that each man

00:47.648 --> 00:50.351
has gotta grow a set of balls.

00:51.985 --> 00:53.621
<i>- Hello?
- Jo, it's me.</i>

00:53.754 --> 00:54.922
I heard you called Tina.

00:55.055 --> 00:58.526
<i>Radio silence for 25 years...</i>

00:58.659 --> 01:01.595
- Why now?
- I don't know.

01:01.729 --> 01:03.631
<i>He's dying, Dwight.</i>

01:03.764 --> 01:06.234

It's all right.

03:49.797 --> 03:51.399
It's okay.

03:53.901 --> 03:55.403
Let me look at you.

03:55.536 --> 03:57.838
- Let me look at you.
- You look great.

03:57.971 --> 03:59.873
So do you. So do you.

04:00.308 --> 04:01.575
How was your flight?

04:01.709 --> 04:03.877
- It's good. It's good.
- Yeah?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.514
Tina here?

04:06.647 --> 04:08.081
Yeah.

04:09.683 --> 04:11.319
Why don't we go see
your brother first, though,

04:11.319 --> 04:12.786
before we start
the whole imbroglio.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.355
- Okay.
- Yeah.

04:14.488 --> 04:15.823
- Just anxious.
- I know.

04:15.956 --> 04:17.558
I don't think
she's ready.

04:21.729 --> 04:23.331
Hey Joe, look who's here.

04:23.464 --> 04:26.967
- My condolences, Denise.
- Oh, he loved you, Dwight.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.836
I loved him, too.
He was a great guy.

04:28.969 --> 04:31.439
Yeah. It's just so sad.

04:31.572 --> 04:33.974
The two of you didn't speak
for so many years

04:34.107 --> 04:35.743
and-- and now this.

04:35.876 --> 04:37.345
I'm sorry.

04:43.351 --> 04:46.253
Twenty years
in a token booth...

04:47.621 --> 04:49.357
and for what?

04:49.857 --> 04:51.024
Goes fast.

04:51.158 --> 04:52.760
Well, it goes slow, too.

04:52.893 --> 04:54.362
Wanna say a prayer?

04:55.128 --> 04:56.564
I already did.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.131
I'm gonna go smoke.

04:58.265 --> 04:59.933
I'm gonna
catch up with you.

05:17.184 --> 05:19.019
Thanks for coming.

05:55.756 --> 05:58.058
Your daughter's
a wonderful woman.

05:59.593 --> 06:02.896
Got a degree in horticulture,
owns her own business.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.231
Hmm.

06:04.432 --> 06:07.435
This husband,
Emory, he's okay?

06:07.535 --> 06:09.169
He's a nice guy.
He adores her.

06:09.302 --> 06:11.271
He's in, uh, finance
or something.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.840
Is he taking
care of her?

06:12.973 --> 06:15.643
Their condo is bigger than
the house we grew up in.

06:15.776 --> 06:17.310
Tell me about
my grandchildren.

06:17.445 --> 06:19.112
They're great.

06:19.246 --> 06:21.682
They're adorable. Twins.

06:22.182 --> 06:23.917
- Come on. Seriously?
- Yeah.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.686
Cody and Ryan.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.723
They're five,
uh, maybe six.

06:32.159 --> 06:34.194
They know about me?

06:35.095 --> 06:36.797
You know what?
I don't wanna do this anymore.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.567
- I don't. I--
- I don't wanna do it either.

06:43.370 --> 06:46.339
- I gotta go back inside.
- Yeah, I gotta go too.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.212
You're coming
to the mass tomorrow?

06:58.519 --> 07:00.754
I'd like to say
something at the mass.

07:00.888 --> 07:03.356
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

07:13.567 --> 07:15.669
Hell of a hiccup
over at the festival.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.505
Territorial dispute.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.640
A couple of boys
had their inventory took.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.109
I'm talking nitrous oxide.
You two follow?

07:22.643 --> 07:24.678
- A lot of money.
- Yeah.

07:25.212 --> 07:26.880
We cannot have that.

07:27.014 --> 07:28.381
As you can imagine,

07:28.516 --> 07:30.050
I'm getting some pressure
from the top dog...

07:31.384 --> 07:33.320
to respond,
if you will.

07:34.387 --> 07:36.824
rapidly and resoundingly.

07:37.925 --> 07:40.528
- What do you want from us?
- Did you hear what I just said?

07:41.261 --> 07:43.130
The big man's
not happy.

07:43.831 --> 07:45.533
He'd like
your attention on this.

07:46.199 --> 07:47.535
Pronto.

07:49.537 --> 07:50.938
License plate number.

07:51.338 --> 07:52.740
One of the guys
we're looking for.

08:04.351 --> 08:05.686
Yeah.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.988
I gotta hear
from strangers you're back.

08:08.121 --> 08:09.322
What's going on?

08:09.456 --> 08:10.991
<i>You know, it looks bad</i>

08:11.124 --> 08:12.726
<i>you sneak into town
and I'm not aware.</i>

08:13.093 --> 08:16.129
My brother died, but you
probably already heard that.

08:16.597 --> 08:18.265
This is family.

08:18.398 --> 08:20.568
- You understand?
- It's my brother.

08:20.701 --> 08:21.835
<i>"Token Joe,"</i> buonanima.

08:21.969 --> 08:24.772
- But my dad...
- What about him?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.775
Just get your ass to New York
Memorial in the morning.

08:28.308 --> 08:30.811
It's my brother's funeral.
I have obligations.

08:30.944 --> 08:33.747
Remember your first
and highest obligation.

08:34.414 --> 08:35.983
My father
was a brother to you too.

08:36.116 --> 08:38.418
<i>Don't you fucking
forget that.</i>

08:40.988 --> 08:43.624
Was I?

08:52.833 --> 08:54.602
<i>Woodvale Salon.
This is Charice.</i>

08:54.735 --> 08:58.305
Hi. Yes.
My-- my name is Tyson Mitchell.

08:58.438 --> 09:01.241
And I'm-- I'm with
the Acme Big Booty Service.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.943
<i>Oh, my God.
He returns.</i>

09:03.076 --> 09:04.978
What's going on,
baby girl? You good?

09:05.112 --> 09:06.780
<i>Better now.
Where the hell have you been?</i>

09:06.914 --> 09:08.515
Ripping and running busy,
you know?

09:08.649 --> 09:10.150
Hey, I got
my own place now, so,

09:10.283 --> 09:11.919
you know, I'm grounded.

09:12.052 --> 09:14.287
Shit!

09:16.523 --> 09:18.225
Here we go
with this shit, man.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.762
Hey, hey. Lemme--
lemme call you back, all right?

09:31.872 --> 09:33.306
Your license and registration.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.644
Hands where I can see 'em.

09:37.444 --> 09:38.946
Registration is in the glove.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.755
Who's this Dwight Manfredi?

09:47.888 --> 09:49.657
- He's my boss.
- Oh, yeah?

09:51.424 --> 09:53.661
Why don't you step
outta the car for me?

09:58.131 --> 10:01.268
No, you're not under arrest,
but for my protection,

10:01.401 --> 10:03.270
I am gonna cuff you
and give you a good toss.

10:03.403 --> 10:05.673
- You wearing a body camera?
- Why? You wanna be a movie star?

10:05.806 --> 10:07.340
- Some bullshit, man.
- Duly noted.

10:10.811 --> 10:12.946
Have a seat.

10:13.747 --> 10:15.182
Damn!

10:16.750 --> 10:18.618
You can't search my car
without a warrant.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.321
- Oh yeah? Who says?
- The constitution.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.691
Ah, look what I found.

10:25.425 --> 10:28.796
Now, this smells
suspiciously like marijuana.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.230
Come on, man.
That's not even mine.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.232
This car ain't even mine.
I told you that.

10:32.365 --> 10:35.202
So you're saying
you stole this vehicle?

10:37.437 --> 10:38.972
<i>This is Dwight. Leave a message.</i>

10:39.106 --> 10:41.008
<i>The mailbox is full</i>

10:41.141 --> 10:42.710
<i>and cannot accept
any messages at this time.</i>

10:42.843 --> 10:44.544
Hey, I'm gonna need
another call, man.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.046
Well, I need a foot massage

10:46.179 --> 10:47.915
and it looks like
we're both outta luck.

10:50.751 --> 10:52.185
Close group one.

11:07.801 --> 11:10.270
Couple bottles of Sassicaia 94.

11:10.403 --> 11:13.106
- Pinot Grigio.
Whatever anybody else wants.
- Yes, sir.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.843
- Just take care of them.
Keep it coming.
- Thank you, sir.

11:17.010 --> 11:18.812
Ah, it's good to be home.

11:18.946 --> 11:22.249
Of course,
not under these circumstances.

11:26.586 --> 11:28.621
I'm sorry, I don't remember
half the people.

11:28.756 --> 11:30.758
Who's everybody here?

11:30.758 --> 11:33.060
- This Stella. Selena.
- My daughter.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.928
- That's Stella?
- Yeah.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.830
There's Ethan,
Stella's husband, right?

11:36.964 --> 11:39.399
- It's nice to meet you, Ethan.
- You know Joe Junior?

11:39.532 --> 11:42.870
- You I know. Of course, you look
exactly like your old man.
- Thank you.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.604
- That's a good thing.
- Yeah. Thanks.

11:45.172 --> 11:48.575
Emory, we haven't been

11:48.776 --> 11:50.343
formally introduced.

11:50.778 --> 11:51.979
Well, I'm Emory.
I'm Tina's husband.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.981
Ah, we talked
on the phone.

11:54.114 --> 11:55.515
That's right,
we spoke briefly.

11:55.648 --> 11:57.684
There was a phone
where I was too, you know?

11:58.518 --> 12:02.355
- I-- I don't follow.
- Well, I'm just saying
you could have called

12:02.489 --> 12:05.358
and sought my blessing,
before you married my daughter.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.796
- The balls on you. Wow!
- I'm old school. I'm sorry.

12:09.229 --> 12:11.331
Yeah, you were also indisposed, remember?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.266
- But very easy to find.
- Okay.

12:13.400 --> 12:16.003
So you wanted this man
to endure a cavity search

12:16.136 --> 12:18.138
just to secure
your blessing?

12:19.439 --> 12:21.574
You're the one
who stopped calling us.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.146
My apologies, Emory.

12:30.250 --> 12:32.052
- Everybody hungry?
- I don't know.

12:32.185 --> 12:33.921
What was wrong with Bamonte's,
we had to drive

12:34.054 --> 12:36.189
- all the way to the city?
- Stop with Bamonte's.

12:36.323 --> 12:38.525
- Nobody eats at Bamonte's.
- Walter, this is four star.

12:38.658 --> 12:41.494
- Broaden your horizons.
- It's very nice, Uncle Dwight.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.396
- Joey would've loved it.
- Thank you. Yeah.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.498
- Thank you.
- Really,
foie gras ravioli?

12:45.632 --> 12:47.734
I mean, come on.
Uncle Joey is rolling

12:47.868 --> 12:49.837
- in his freshly dug grave,
right now.
- Oh, Tina!

12:49.970 --> 12:51.638
Am I wrong? Okay.

12:51.839 --> 12:53.974
This isn't about
what Uncle Joey would like.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.843
This isn't even about
what we would like.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.846
It's about what makes Dwight
look like a big shot.

12:59.212 --> 13:03.183
It's a nice place.
That's all. It's a gesture.

13:04.017 --> 13:05.118
Big splash, right,

13:05.252 --> 13:07.087
with the massive
spray of flowers

13:07.220 --> 13:09.089
and your big fat <i>busta.</i>

13:09.222 --> 13:10.858
Not for nothing, Unc, but...

13:11.491 --> 13:13.994
you settled the tab with Mikey C
at Supreme Memorials?

13:14.494 --> 13:17.564
We appreciate it,
but nobody asked you to do that.

13:17.697 --> 13:19.599
Denise,
you didn't have to ask.

13:19.732 --> 13:22.335
All right.
So he was just trying to help.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.371
Right.
Because whenever I needed help,

13:24.504 --> 13:26.173
first person I thought of,
was my dad.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.275
A toast...

13:31.578 --> 13:32.712
to Joe.

13:32.880 --> 13:34.414
May he rest in peace.

13:39.552 --> 13:41.054
And to...

13:42.255 --> 13:44.224
wiping out the past...

13:45.358 --> 13:48.929
and everybody
just enjoying

13:49.062 --> 13:51.664
the here and now,
while we can.

13:52.299 --> 13:53.466
Salut.

13:53.600 --> 13:55.468
Salut.

14:00.007 --> 14:04.211
- My deepest condolences, auntie.
I love you.
- Tina.

14:04.344 --> 14:06.446
It's okay-- you guys
enjoy dinner, okay?

14:10.050 --> 14:13.686
- I'll call you tomorrow.
Come on. Good night, uncle.
- Good night, sweetheart.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.679
- So, what did you like
at Remington?
- Nothing.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.782
Get that horse
cooled down, Richie.

14:46.586 --> 14:49.356
Hey there. Heard you've been
moonlighting as a tough guy.

14:50.423 --> 14:51.858
What?

14:52.225 --> 14:53.460
Tussle at the festival?

14:54.027 --> 14:56.964
Seminoles, Seniors and stoners.
Quite a gang you run with.

14:57.064 --> 14:59.699
- You a fucking smartass?
- Easy, <i>jefe!</i>

14:59.832 --> 15:01.034
Just a word to the wise.

15:08.308 --> 15:10.510
- Goodie, come on.
Fucking go already, would you?
- Relax.

15:10.643 --> 15:13.280
Quit your hemming and hawing.
We know you ain't got shit.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.049
- Hey, what you don't know
could fill a book.
- Too bad he couldn't read it.

15:16.183 --> 15:18.118
- I'll give youse all
a fucking <i>schiaff'.</i>
- Language.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.620
- All right, go ahead.
- The General approaches.

15:20.753 --> 15:21.989
Hey, Jerry.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.591
- Nico, Goodie. Ladies, hi.
- Dwight.

15:24.724 --> 15:27.860
- Dwight, how are you doing?
- Good. How are you doing, Nico?

15:28.361 --> 15:30.330
- In town long?
- In and out, why?

15:30.463 --> 15:32.332
Here we go. That's two.

15:32.465 --> 15:34.801
Do I hear four?

15:35.002 --> 15:37.270
- Got a tissue?
- Let me be of service.

15:39.239 --> 15:41.074
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

15:41.208 --> 15:42.842
Now, that's a gentleman.

15:44.744 --> 15:47.480
- Oh, here we go.
- Come on, what are you
trying to do, show me up?

15:47.614 --> 15:49.482
- I show you up by showing up.
- Oh, yeah, that's right.

15:49.616 --> 15:51.684
- Hey, hey. Even in
the fucking hospital?
- Vince, come on.

15:51.818 --> 15:53.320
- Talk to him.
- It's over.

15:53.453 --> 15:55.355
- Vince.
- Let's go.

15:55.488 --> 15:57.757
- Chickie, thank you.
- You know, you ought to be
a lifeguard, Nico.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.227
All right. Go ahead. I'll take
more of your fucking money.

16:00.360 --> 16:04.031
- Vince, sit down.
- You know, I learned the word
in the military.

16:04.164 --> 16:05.598
Deference.

16:06.599 --> 16:08.035
It means respect.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.604
Military.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.407
You talking
about Dickinson Academy?

16:14.541 --> 16:17.944
- Yeah.
- It's a military school.

16:18.078 --> 16:19.946
I was a ranked cadet.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.049
A pair of epaulets doesn't
make you George Washington.

16:22.182 --> 16:23.850
You know that, right?

16:24.951 --> 16:26.486
I'm gonna talk
to your old man.

16:26.619 --> 16:28.055
He's asleep.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.458
And the next time I call,
you come right away.

16:31.958 --> 16:33.326
You ought to get
a cocker spaniel,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.362
they come every time.

16:44.471 --> 16:46.739
Sir. Excuse me, sir.

16:46.873 --> 16:48.875
I need to go
to that bathroom, right now.

16:49.076 --> 16:51.444
- It's urgent. I need to go.
- Who's stopping you?

16:51.578 --> 16:54.081
Ain't nobody stopping me,
where I'm supposed to go?

16:57.084 --> 16:58.551
Officer, please,

16:58.685 --> 17:00.287
I have to go right now,
for real.

17:00.753 --> 17:03.223
- This your phone?
- Yeah, it's my phone.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.093
- What's your password?
- Come on now--

17:06.626 --> 17:08.828
Don't make me beg you, officer.

17:16.669 --> 17:18.438
051944.

17:19.939 --> 17:21.541
Bingo.
Show the man the head.

17:21.674 --> 17:23.009
My pleasure.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.949
So what do I owe
the pleasure?

17:30.117 --> 17:32.119
Just wanted to hear
a friendly voice.

17:32.919 --> 17:36.523
You wanna meet
for coffee or something?

17:36.656 --> 17:38.125
I can't. I'm in New York.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.826
You just booked it
outta here,

17:39.959 --> 17:41.594
after your run in
at the music festival?

17:41.961 --> 17:44.397
- I saw my daughter.
<i>- How'd that go?</i>

17:44.864 --> 17:49.202
<i>- It didn't.
She really wouldn't let me talk.</i>
- I'm sorry.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.272
<i>I'd be lying
if I said I was surprised.</i>

17:52.405 --> 17:53.973
It's been 18 years.

17:54.141 --> 17:56.476
Just keep trying.
She'll come around.

17:57.710 --> 18:00.647
- You think so?
- The fuck do I know.

18:00.780 --> 18:02.915
Oh, God.

18:06.653 --> 18:09.021
<i>Listen,
these nitrous guys,</i>

18:09.156 --> 18:11.924
<i>there's more to them
than meets the eye, okay?</i>

18:12.058 --> 18:15.195
- Such as?
- Not over the phone.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.064
Listen, uh--

18:18.198 --> 18:19.732
I gotta take
this phone call.

18:19.866 --> 18:21.168
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?

18:21.301 --> 18:24.171
Yeah, safe travels.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.005
Tyson.

18:26.173 --> 18:28.875
<i>Hello?
Tyson, are you there?</i>

18:31.344 --> 18:32.779
Bag him.

18:39.986 --> 18:42.622
Mitchell.
Tyson Mitchell.

18:42.755 --> 18:44.191
- That's me.
- It's check-out time.

18:45.258 --> 18:47.794
- Enjoy your stay?
- Shit, man, weak as hell.

18:47.927 --> 18:49.061
I'll make a note,

18:49.196 --> 18:50.663
and next time,
we'll upgrade you

18:50.797 --> 18:51.998
to less comfortable accommodations.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.700
There will be
no next time, man.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.369
- Where my car at?
- Impound on King Street.

18:56.836 --> 18:59.071
And my phone too, man.
Quit playing with me.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.808
It says here
you don't have no phone.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.075
No money, either.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.877
Whoa, I came here
with $1,200.

19:05.011 --> 19:07.347
If I were you,
I'd write your congressman.

19:19.559 --> 19:22.329
<i>You've reached
the Manfredi residence.</i>

19:22.462 --> 19:24.764
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

19:24.897 --> 19:26.533
<i>Hey, Denise, it's Dwight.</i>

19:26.999 --> 19:28.801
<i>It's really nice
hearing my brother's voice</i>

19:28.935 --> 19:30.403
<i>on the machine.</i>

19:30.537 --> 19:32.372
<i>There were some things
I wanted to say--</i>

19:32.505 --> 19:34.707
<i>should have said--
at the church,</i>

19:34.841 --> 19:38.878
but I'd like
to say them now, so...

19:40.713 --> 19:42.249
I wrote something down.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.252
Here it goes.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.490
"Little brother,
you were a giant.

19:52.259 --> 19:55.662
A big man who did
the little things,

19:55.795 --> 19:57.797
the things
that really matter.

19:58.765 --> 20:00.467
The sympathetic ear.

20:00.967 --> 20:02.502
The helping hand.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.204
The heart of gold.

20:06.072 --> 20:07.774
The voice of reason.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.443
Steady as a rock...

20:11.678 --> 20:13.112
you were always there.

20:14.247 --> 20:16.349
Not only
for your family, but...

20:17.817 --> 20:19.686
to do the job
you loved.

20:19.819 --> 20:21.921
I'm not sure
why you loved it...

20:22.855 --> 20:24.291
but you did.

20:24.924 --> 20:29.061
Guys like Joe are a rare
and precious find.

20:29.596 --> 20:31.331
Generous to a fault.

20:32.765 --> 20:34.534
Going long,

20:34.667 --> 20:36.235
where others fall short.

20:37.537 --> 20:40.106
Made of mercy and malice.

20:40.607 --> 20:43.843
<i>Full of force and foibles.</i>

20:44.544 --> 20:48.047
<i>They don't drop names,
they pick up the slack.</i>

20:48.415 --> 20:51.017
<i>They don't raise
their voices,</i>

20:51.150 --> 20:53.320
they lower the temperature.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.491
They don't hold grudges.

20:59.392 --> 21:01.928
They unlock potential.

21:03.830 --> 21:05.465
They don't show off...

21:08.435 --> 21:09.869
they show up."

21:14.341 --> 21:16.443
- Hey!
- Manny.

21:16.576 --> 21:18.445
So, what the fuck
were you talking about

21:18.578 --> 21:19.812
the other day?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.448
You wanna pretend
like that wasn't you

21:21.581 --> 21:23.215
- at Ogallala-land?
- No, it was me.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.984
I'm just asking you,
like, what did you mean

21:25.117 --> 21:26.553
by word to the wise?

21:26.686 --> 21:27.820
Ever heard of Black Macadam?

21:27.954 --> 21:29.155
No, what is that?
A band?

21:29.356 --> 21:31.458
Not hardly.
Motorcycle gang.

21:31.591 --> 21:32.992
One percenters.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.594
My old man's sergeant at arms.

21:34.727 --> 21:37.063
Yeah?
Kinda like leader of the pack?

21:37.196 --> 21:39.031
Yeah.
Keep laughing.

21:39.165 --> 21:40.867
They run
the nitrous game out here,

21:41.000 --> 21:42.435
and they're not to be
fucked with.

21:42.569 --> 21:44.136
Meaning what?

21:44.270 --> 21:46.105
Meaning they'll kill anyone
that gets in their way.

21:46.238 --> 21:48.375
Huh, you know,
it's funny,

21:48.508 --> 21:50.977
I've actually met
people like that before.

21:51.911 --> 21:53.380
Why don't you Google 'em,

21:53.480 --> 21:55.615
and then let me know
how funny you think it is.

22:10.730 --> 22:13.032
Tyson Mitchell,
tell me about him.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.502
I barely know him.
I barely know him.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.404
And yet your name

22:17.537 --> 22:20.139
is in the frequent contacts
of his cell phone?

22:20.272 --> 22:23.710
I do business with his boss,
Dwight Manfredi.

22:23.843 --> 22:25.277
And he is?

22:25.978 --> 22:28.681
The bane
of my fucking existence.

22:41.093 --> 22:43.663
I take it that Senor Manfredi

22:43.796 --> 22:46.433
is the older gentleman.

22:46.799 --> 22:48.234
Yeah.

22:48.868 --> 22:52.839
And what is the nature

22:52.972 --> 22:54.907
of your business together?

22:55.442 --> 22:57.076
I believe
the term is "extortion."

22:57.209 --> 22:58.945
You extort people?

22:59.078 --> 23:00.580
He's extorting me.

23:01.548 --> 23:03.983
What do you have
that he wants?

23:04.451 --> 23:06.218
What does everybody want?

23:06.352 --> 23:07.687
<i>Dosh.</i>

23:07.820 --> 23:10.790
Well, his mistake.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.925
Senor Manfredi, I mean,

23:13.059 --> 23:15.495
is trying to take mine.

23:15.628 --> 23:17.997
I'd be happy
to relay that message to him.

23:18.130 --> 23:21.300
And you will.

23:22.835 --> 23:24.136
But not quite yet.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.145
<i>♪ Could be holding

23:35.181 --> 23:39.185

24:05.077 --> 24:06.212
Help you, fellas?

24:06.345 --> 24:08.114
This mutt belong to you?

24:08.247 --> 24:10.116
It depends.
He wearing a tag?

24:10.249 --> 24:11.518
You're Mitch, right?

24:11.651 --> 24:13.419
AKA Mitch the Stick?

24:13.553 --> 24:15.254
Hate to break up
your little daisy chain,

24:15.387 --> 24:16.889
but we need a word.

24:17.356 --> 24:18.591
No, thanks.

24:19.191 --> 24:21.260
You under the impression
that we're negotiating?

24:21.393 --> 24:23.696
- Get the fuck out of my joint.
- Excuse me?

24:23.830 --> 24:25.331
You want it
in fucking sign language?

24:25.532 --> 24:27.834
I suggest
in the strongest of terms,

24:27.967 --> 24:29.201
you take it down a notch.

24:29.335 --> 24:31.203
And I suggest,
since this establishment

24:31.337 --> 24:32.805
is situated
on Cherokee land,

24:32.939 --> 24:34.741
where you have
absolutely no authority,

24:34.874 --> 24:38.010
that you get your fat sorry
fucking cottage cheese asses

24:38.144 --> 24:39.579
out of here.

24:54.561 --> 24:57.429
- See you soon.
- Looking forward to it.

24:57.897 --> 25:00.332
Fuck's going on?

25:48.380 --> 25:49.816
Sorry, we're closed.

25:51.117 --> 25:53.019
I could use some roses.

26:02.729 --> 26:04.063
What are you doing here?

26:04.196 --> 26:05.698
Just wanted to talk.

26:07.867 --> 26:09.636
Look, Tina,
I know you hate me, okay?

26:09.769 --> 26:11.170
I don't hate you, Dwight.

26:11.704 --> 26:13.339
I feel bad for you.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.643
You have to call me
by my first name?

26:17.744 --> 26:19.511
It's either that,
or Mr. Manfredi.

26:19.646 --> 26:21.648
"Dad" ship kinda left port
years ago.

26:21.781 --> 26:23.215
Dwight it is.

26:26.518 --> 26:28.655
And I will admit, Dwight,

26:28.655 --> 26:30.690
there is something inside me.

26:31.658 --> 26:33.525
Little flickering ember
of love for you.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.361
But something
just tells me

26:35.494 --> 26:37.129
to stomp it out
once and for all.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.031
Hope you don't do that.

26:39.799 --> 26:41.100
You're a bad bet.

26:41.668 --> 26:42.935
How's that?

26:43.069 --> 26:44.470
Because
you haven't learned anything.

26:44.671 --> 26:46.105
Oh, you'd be surprised.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.441
- I've learned a lot.
- Oh, really?

26:49.575 --> 26:50.810
Mmm.

26:51.210 --> 26:53.880
Then what in God's name
are you doing in Oklahoma?

26:57.383 --> 27:00.953
It's a little late in the game
for me to find a new trade.

27:02.922 --> 27:05.057
Let's just
end this now, Dwight.

27:05.457 --> 27:06.959
I wanna get home
to my kids.

27:07.093 --> 27:08.695
Can I see them, please?

27:09.595 --> 27:12.398
Tina,
is there any way for us

27:12.531 --> 27:15.101
just to--
to move past this?

27:15.234 --> 27:17.837
We definitely
can't go back now, can we?

27:20.039 --> 27:21.407
You know,
the day after Christmas

27:21.540 --> 27:23.209
was always such a relief.

27:23.342 --> 27:25.611
And that went
for every holiday,

27:25.745 --> 27:27.279
every milestone.

27:27.413 --> 27:31.217
You learn to dread
what should be happy times,

27:31.350 --> 27:34.987
and your life
becomes topsy-turvy.

27:37.156 --> 27:39.458
I don't wanna talk about this.
Let's talk about Uncle Joe.

27:39.591 --> 27:42.128
- May he rest in peace.
- Yeah.

27:44.964 --> 27:47.199
Would you have preferred
if it was me?

27:53.239 --> 27:54.741
No.

28:02.949 --> 28:04.383
But Uncle Joey...

28:06.318 --> 28:07.854
he was parked
outside my senior prom

28:07.987 --> 28:09.421
at the El Caribe.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.958
Pounding Michelobs
for three hours

28:12.091 --> 28:13.826
just to keep
an eye on my date.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.129
Ma gave me her pearls.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.567
And Aunt Joanne got
Anna B from the Style Inn

28:21.768 --> 28:23.269
to do my hair
and makeup.

28:28.174 --> 28:29.408
You...

28:31.677 --> 28:33.112
left us nothing.

28:35.614 --> 28:37.049
Nothing.

28:38.584 --> 28:39.986
Burdens...

28:40.787 --> 28:43.990
- obligations that wait.
- I know.

28:45.091 --> 28:46.492
And when you went away,

28:46.625 --> 28:48.494
Ma didn't have so much
as a checking account.

28:52.098 --> 28:56.235
Nico "The Package" Bugliosi
was the only one

28:56.368 --> 28:58.437
who'd come check in on us
from time to time.

28:58.570 --> 29:00.472
- Do you remember The Package?
- Yeah.

29:01.808 --> 29:04.176
I just saw him
at the hospital.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.646
Well, let's just say
one Tuesday night,

29:07.814 --> 29:09.181
while Ma was working a double

29:09.315 --> 29:12.018
I learned the hard way
why he's called--

29:15.021 --> 29:16.455
Why he's called what?

29:16.856 --> 29:18.390
Nothing.

29:19.525 --> 29:21.828
No, it's not. No.
Wait a minute.

29:21.961 --> 29:24.363
I-- it's not nothing. Stop.

29:24.496 --> 29:25.998
Called what?

29:26.132 --> 29:27.666
-"The Package"? Is that--
- Forget it.

29:27.834 --> 29:29.735
No, I'm not--
what are you trying to tell me?

29:29.869 --> 29:31.203
I don't wanna talk
about it.

29:31.337 --> 29:33.005
I don't even wanna
think about it, okay?

29:33.139 --> 29:34.673
No, please.
I'm-- I'm begging you.

29:34.841 --> 29:37.176
- No. No. Just--
- Tell me what happened.

29:37.309 --> 29:39.045
He did nothing.
Just forget it. Okay?

29:39.178 --> 29:40.880
- I can't forget it.
- No, please. Just--

29:41.013 --> 29:42.849
Please, Tina.
Please, I'm begging.

29:42.949 --> 29:44.516
- No.
- Just tell me.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.152
I'm asking you.

29:46.552 --> 29:49.922
Promise me
you won't do anything.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.564
Thank you.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.688
They finally got here.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.326
- Hey.
- How you doing?

31:00.459 --> 31:03.729
What a sight for sore eyes.

31:05.731 --> 31:08.267
I'm, uh...

31:08.400 --> 31:09.936
...hanging in there.

31:10.069 --> 31:11.603
That's good.

31:11.737 --> 31:13.139
Where's everybody?

31:13.672 --> 31:14.974
Chickie, Nico...

31:15.541 --> 31:18.610
They took off, to the club.

31:18.744 --> 31:20.212
Mm.

31:20.346 --> 31:22.514
How you doing?
You good?

31:23.015 --> 31:25.351
Mm-hmm.
I'm very good.

31:26.953 --> 31:30.222
I brought you this
from my brother's wake.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.624
I'm sorry abut that happening.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.695
I'm sure you would've been
there if you could.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.264
You kidding me?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.800
Of course.

31:44.136 --> 31:45.671
I was thinking
the other day, Pete,

31:45.804 --> 31:47.339
that when I was
in the joint,

31:47.473 --> 31:49.675
I used to think
about the good old days

31:49.808 --> 31:52.511
and friends, family.

31:52.644 --> 31:53.980
Good times.

31:54.846 --> 31:58.250
When you finally get out,
you look around...

31:59.651 --> 32:01.820
you realize
the good old days...

32:02.989 --> 32:04.290
were not really that good.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.293
Yeah. It's an adjustment.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.528
Sure.
It's an adjustment.

32:11.998 --> 32:15.634
Because now I realize
what I missed.

32:16.435 --> 32:18.637
Seeing my daughter
grow up...

32:19.505 --> 32:21.007
become a woman...

32:22.008 --> 32:23.375
get married.

32:24.610 --> 32:27.913
And she did all that
without me protecting her.

32:29.915 --> 32:32.684
And that kills me.

32:35.387 --> 32:37.856
'Cause that's what
a good father does.

32:39.458 --> 32:42.494
Protects the ones
they're responsible for.

32:44.396 --> 32:45.931
The ones they love.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.539
And then there's...

32:54.840 --> 32:56.275
you.

32:56.742 --> 32:58.044
You swore...

32:58.810 --> 33:00.546
on the soul
of your mother,

33:00.679 --> 33:04.450
you'd watch out
for my wife, my kid.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.652
You swore that.

33:07.286 --> 33:09.055
And then this Nico...

33:12.258 --> 33:13.692
Did you know?

33:14.926 --> 33:16.062
Know what?

33:16.195 --> 33:18.964
What the fuck
are you talking about?

33:19.098 --> 33:20.799
I'm not following you.

33:25.371 --> 33:26.805
Did...

33:28.874 --> 33:30.309
you...

33:31.277 --> 33:32.778
fucking...

33:33.912 --> 33:35.081
know?

33:46.092 --> 33:47.659
You didn't.

33:57.536 --> 33:58.970
Know what?

34:00.206 --> 34:01.873
Know what?

34:03.975 --> 34:05.777
Raging Bull...

34:05.911 --> 34:07.946
Then he says, "I dunno whether
to fuck him or fight him!"

34:08.114 --> 34:10.249
- Whose deal is it?
- Vince.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.551
- I just fucking dealt.
- You just dealt?

34:12.684 --> 34:14.253
Yo! What are you doing here?

34:14.386 --> 34:16.255
Get the door.

34:18.790 --> 34:20.626
My fucking daughter?

34:20.759 --> 34:22.461
Dwight!

34:22.594 --> 34:24.563
Come on!

34:33.139 --> 34:35.241
Enough already! You're gonna
fucking kill him!

34:35.374 --> 34:36.508
My daughter.

34:36.642 --> 34:38.510
My fucking daughter.

34:40.146 --> 34:43.282
<i>Will kiss, just as before ♪</i>

34:43.415 --> 34:44.950
Where are you going?

34:45.151 --> 34:48.320
<i>♪ Happy we'll be
beyond the sea ♪</i>

34:48.454 --> 34:50.556
<i>And never again-- ♪</i>

34:52.491 --> 34:55.026
<i>I'll go sailing ♪</i>

35:00.031 --> 35:01.300
You clean it up.

35:16.081 --> 35:18.184
I know he's your friend, pop,
but Jesus...

35:19.651 --> 35:20.952
What do we do with Dwight?

35:22.421 --> 35:23.655
Mr. Manfredi...

35:23.789 --> 35:25.591
Sir, you're overplaying
your hand.

35:25.724 --> 35:28.860
When I play my hand,
you won't see it coming.

35:28.994 --> 35:31.330
That's your idea
of cooling things down?

35:31.463 --> 35:33.699
Nobody said
I was a diplomat.

35:33.832 --> 35:35.267
I'd like to ask you
a few questions

35:35.401 --> 35:36.368
about a Dwight Manfredi.

35:38.036 --> 35:40.372
Whatever you're doing
you gotta stop.
