Mr. Getty is
in surprisingly good health

00:33.201 --> 00:35.536
considering his months
in captivity.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.706
We are treating him
for mild malnutrition

We expect him to be in hospital

How about that?

00:56.056 --> 00:57.658
The boy gets released.

00:57.691 --> 01:00.828

And this is the marble frieze

in a room downstairs.

I have built as a home for it

04:18.292 --> 04:19.527
in Pacific Palisades.

04:19.560 --> 04:20.828
What's he talking about?

04:20.861 --> 04:22.229
PAUL:
Close to the sea.

04:22.262 --> 04:26.600
It's air conditioned
and constructed strictly

04:26.634 --> 04:29.637
to house these objects alone,

04:29.670 --> 04:33.774
where they will be admired

04:33.807 --> 04:38.879
and if-if I may
use the word, loved...

04:38.912 --> 04:44.752
as they have never been loved
ever before.

04:44.785 --> 04:46.987
Lights.

04:47.020 --> 04:50.524
And you, ladies and gentlemen,

04:50.558 --> 04:53.994
will have a large room

04:54.027 --> 04:57.431
to fill

04:57.465 --> 04:59.266
It's an exciting prospect.

04:59.299 --> 05:01.769
Mr. Getty, there has clearly
been a misunderstanding.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.837
I was under the impression
we were...

05:03.871 --> 05:06.474
Gerald, I thought Mr. Getty
was offering his portions

05:06.507 --> 05:10.411
-of the the Parthenon Frieze
to the museum.
-Mm-hmm.

05:10.444 --> 05:14.081
No. No.

05:14.114 --> 05:18.919
Mr. Getty is offering you
half a billion dollars.

05:32.633 --> 05:38.338
suddenly as rich...
as rich as I am.

05:38.372 --> 05:43.276
You want us to hand over
the Elgin Marbles to you?

05:43.310 --> 05:48.882
Well, they're not really yours
to keep, are they?

05:48.916 --> 05:51.819
Stolen. I mean,
perhaps that's too strong.

05:51.852 --> 05:53.487
We bloody well paid for them.

05:53.521 --> 05:57.324
Well, let's call it kidnapped

05:57.357 --> 06:00.494
and I'm here to pay the ransom

What impasse?

06:05.198 --> 06:06.867
We don't need a way out.

06:06.900 --> 06:09.637
Oh, you will.

06:09.670 --> 06:13.707
The Papadopoulos regime
is going to be overthrown.

06:13.741 --> 06:17.678

of the triumphant return

06:17.711 --> 06:19.112
of democracy to Greece,

06:19.146 --> 06:22.516
the government will file a brief
with UNESCO

06:22.550 --> 06:25.586

of its rightful property,

06:25.619 --> 06:27.320
the Elgin Marbles.

06:27.354 --> 06:29.222
Well, that's just
bloody nonsense.

Mr. Ortoli, who is the president
of the European Commission

06:32.560 --> 06:34.528

take you on?
