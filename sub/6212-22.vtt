WEBVTT

00:04.872 --> 00:08.141
Hey, want a fresh cup
of the Guatemalan?

00:09.176 --> 00:11.979
Obviously, you prefer
the Venezuelan.

00:12.246 --> 00:13.847
Well, why don't you
go talk to him?

00:13.847 --> 00:15.382
I can't just go up
and introduce myself

00:15.382 --> 00:17.651
to a guy I don't even know.

00:17.651 --> 00:19.486
What if he's not
interested in me?

00:19.486 --> 00:21.088
Well, you'll never know
unless you go say hello.

00:21.088 --> 00:23.090
Or <i>hola.</i> You know, your choice.

00:27.094 --> 00:28.562
I can't do it!

00:28.562 --> 00:30.564
Just bring me something
with a lot of chocolate

00:30.564 --> 00:33.800
and leave me alone.

00:33.800 --> 00:35.602
Some people in here
are so pathetic.

00:35.602 --> 00:36.803
What can we do?

00:36.803 --> 00:38.138
Hilda's our boss.

00:38.138 --> 00:40.908
But once we graduate, we'll
never have to see her again.

00:40.908 --> 00:43.010
Well, <i>you</i> might have to--
she's your aunt.

00:43.010 --> 00:45.245
I'm talking about
our single customers.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.780
I wish there was
some way we could
bring them together.

00:46.780 --> 00:48.248
You know, "You're a nice
guy; you're a nice girl.

00:48.248 --> 00:50.250
Now, go get a blood
test and a mortgage."

00:50.250 --> 00:51.952
Hey, you know,
I've heard of these parties

00:51.952 --> 00:54.454
where singles get paired up
for like five minutes at a time.

00:54.454 --> 00:55.789
If they click,
they exchange phone numbers.

00:55.789 --> 00:58.191
If they don't, they move on
to the next person.

00:58.191 --> 01:00.894
Five-minute dates?
That is so unromantic.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.563
But what a time-saver.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.098
Ew. Ew. Ew.

01:05.098 --> 01:07.367
Are you people <i>trying</i>
to disgust me?

01:07.367 --> 01:09.536
Aunt Hilda, Josh and I want
to turn the coffeehouse

01:09.536 --> 01:10.837
into a singles meeting place.

01:10.837 --> 01:13.473
Great. Then maybe I'll finally
meet someone, dump this joint

01:13.473 --> 01:15.275
and never have to see
these people again.

01:15.275 --> 01:18.979
Well, I may have to see you
again-- you are my niece.

01:18.979 --> 01:19.813
No, Aunt Hilda

01:19.813 --> 01:20.747
the mixers wouldn't be for you--

01:20.747 --> 01:21.982
they'd be for the college kids.

01:21.982 --> 01:24.585
Oh, everything
is for kids!

01:24.585 --> 01:26.954
Movies, fashion, penne pasta.

01:26.954 --> 01:28.422
What was so wrong
with an egg noodle?

01:28.422 --> 01:30.424
We'll charge five dollars
a head; you'll get half.

01:30.424 --> 01:31.992
Wait-wait. We're
charging for this?

01:31.992 --> 01:35.162
Absolutely. People
are desperate for love

01:35.162 --> 01:37.297
and they're willing
to pay big bucks for it.

01:37.297 --> 01:38.832
Great idea, Josh--
Now all you need

01:38.832 --> 01:41.068
is a big, white hat
and a purple El Dorado.

01:41.401 --> 01:42.869
Don't be so cynical, Sabrina.

01:42.869 --> 01:44.371
In a cold and alienating world

01:44.371 --> 01:46.773
it's a wonderful thing
to bring people together.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.543
I'll play hostess and do
stand-up for 60% of the gross.

01:49.543 --> 01:51.311
I'll give you 65%
to take the night off.

01:51.311 --> 01:52.212
Deal.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.514
You know, Josh, I like the idea

01:54.514 --> 01:55.849
of helping out our
single customers

01:55.849 --> 01:57.951
but I'm not sure about
charging five bucks.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.119
Are you kidding me?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.754
These schmoes
spend double that

02:00.754 --> 02:03.390
to sit alone in a
cold, dark cineplex.

02:03.390 --> 02:04.591
At least here,
they have a shot

02:04.591 --> 02:07.027
at looking at someone
besides Helen Hunt.

02:07.027 --> 02:07.861
I'm sold.

02:07.861 --> 02:08.729
And whatever money we make

02:08.729 --> 02:10.931
we'll put towards a nice dinner
for the two of us.

02:10.931 --> 02:12.833
You had me at Helen Hunt.

02:17.337 --> 02:20.374
Poor thing, she'll never get up
the courage to make a move.

02:20.374 --> 02:22.342
A girl needs a guy
who catches her eye

02:22.342 --> 02:24.177
and make her less shy
when he walks by.

02:24.344 --> 02:25.479
( <i>ringing</i> )

02:26.713 --> 02:28.782
-Hey, Sabrina.
-Harvey.

02:28.782 --> 02:31.184
I was in the neighborhood
and decided to drop by.

02:31.184 --> 02:32.219
Oh, I'm glad you did.

02:32.219 --> 02:33.587
You know,
it's great to see you.

02:33.587 --> 02:36.156
So, you want to sit down
and catch up?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.825
Hi. I don't usually
do things like this

02:38.825 --> 02:42.362
but I'm Pam,
and I think you're cute.

02:42.362 --> 02:46.166
Thanks. I'm Harvey, and I
think you're cute, too.

02:46.166 --> 02:48.301
Do you want to go out
and grab something to eat?

02:48.301 --> 02:49.469
I'd love to.

02:49.469 --> 02:51.104
Uh, then afterwards,
we could check out

02:51.104 --> 02:52.839
one of the new
Helen Hunt movies.

02:52.839 --> 02:54.441
See you, Sabrina.

02:56.576 --> 02:57.778
They're lucky.

02:57.778 --> 02:59.946
Next week that would've
cost them five bucks.

Hilda, I just opened
our Visa bill.

03:43.523 --> 03:47.127
How could you spend $3,000
on World War II memorabilia?

03:47.127 --> 03:48.161
What are you talking about?

03:48.161 --> 03:50.363
You know
I'm a Boer War kind of gal.

03:50.363 --> 03:51.965
Well, if these aren't
your Visa charges

03:51.965 --> 03:54.701
and they aren't my Visa charges,
then whose are they?

03:54.701 --> 03:55.769
SALEM:
Mooshi-mooshi.

03:56.570 --> 04:00.107
The name on the card
is Zelda Spellman.

04:00.107 --> 04:04.978
( <i>speaking Japanese</i> )

04:04.978 --> 04:08.014
<i>Domo arigato,</i> Mr. Roboto!

04:08.014 --> 04:09.950
Just what do you
think you're doing?

04:09.950 --> 04:12.219
I know the kimono's
a little gauche

04:12.219 --> 04:13.987
but it's so dang silky.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.623
I'm talking about
my credit card.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.392
Oh, that. Just making
a little impulse buy.

04:19.392 --> 04:22.329
The future
Mrs. Mioshi Saberhagen

04:22.329 --> 04:23.864
ships in two weeks.

04:23.864 --> 04:25.632
You bought a mail-order bride?

04:25.632 --> 04:28.368
Dummy, what are you going to do
when a Japanese woman shows up

04:28.368 --> 04:31.772
and sees that her "number one
American husband" is a cat?

04:31.772 --> 04:33.940
When she sees the engagement
ring you bought her

04:33.940 --> 04:37.277
with your Discover card,
she won't care!

04:37.277 --> 04:37.878
( <i>laughing</i> )

04:37.878 --> 04:41.181
Can you believe the nerve
of that mangy little fur ball?

04:41.181 --> 04:43.150
Stealing from us
and then flaunting it.

04:43.150 --> 04:44.384
( <i>bell dings</i> )

04:44.384 --> 04:48.622
When was the last time actual
toast came out of that thing?

04:48.622 --> 04:49.790
Oh, it's for you

04:49.790 --> 04:51.625
from the Other Realm
Department of Justice.

04:51.625 --> 04:53.794
Justice? That can't be good.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.435
Oh, you're looking fine.

05:02.435 --> 05:04.571
Well, I was feeling fine
until you showed up.

05:04.571 --> 05:05.806
What do you want, Harry?

05:05.806 --> 05:06.873
A date for New Year's.

05:06.873 --> 05:09.743
And to read this.

05:09.743 --> 05:10.877
"Hilda Spellman

05:10.877 --> 05:13.446
as a gesture of amnesty,
the outgoing president

05:13.446 --> 05:15.315
of the Witch's Council
pardons you

05:15.315 --> 05:18.251
and everyone else involved
in the Witchwater scandal.

05:18.251 --> 05:19.653
That's fantastic!

05:19.653 --> 05:20.821
I've been pardoned!

05:20.821 --> 05:23.690
I knew buying his wife
that spa weekend would pay off.

05:23.690 --> 05:25.592
And the bottom line is,
you're no longer required

05:25.592 --> 05:28.228
to feed, clothe and house
Salem Saberhagen.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.565
The feline felon will be
assigned a new halfway house.

05:31.565 --> 05:33.633
Salem won't be living
with us anymore?

05:33.633 --> 05:35.202
Hilda, have you forgotten?

05:35.202 --> 05:37.404
He's a hardened criminal
who led a bloody insurrection

05:37.404 --> 05:39.506
to try to take over the world.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.541
Everyone makes a mistake
now and then.

05:41.541 --> 05:43.743
I suppose if you really want
to keep him...

05:43.743 --> 05:45.545
Zelda! My Fancy Feast has lumps

05:45.545 --> 05:47.848
and so does
my litter box!

05:47.848 --> 05:51.551
Hilda, roll up your sleeves
and start scooping.

05:51.551 --> 05:53.386
Book him, Dano.

05:53.787 --> 05:54.855
Huh?

05:56.223 --> 05:58.525
Zelda, he's gone.

05:58.525 --> 06:01.728
We'll never see Salem again.

06:01.728 --> 06:03.663
Free at last!

06:03.663 --> 06:05.098
Free at last!

06:05.098 --> 06:06.032
Thank God almighty.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.901
BOTH:
We're free at last!

06:07.901 --> 06:08.802
Whoo-hoo!

06:11.037 --> 06:12.639
Hey, what's that for?

06:12.639 --> 06:14.975
Josh and I are throwing
a singles party at
the coffeehouse.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.409
I'm sure you think
it's stupid.

06:16.409 --> 06:17.744
I haven't been on a date
in five months.

06:17.744 --> 06:19.346
I can live with stupid.

06:19.779 --> 06:22.782
Well, there's no motivation
like desperation.

06:22.782 --> 06:24.985
Okay, so I'm watching
<i>Deep Space Nine.</i>

06:24.985 --> 06:27.587
It was this cool
episode, uh...

06:27.587 --> 06:29.356
about the Borg...

06:29.923 --> 06:31.491
Well, she wasn't
your type anyway.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.994
Yeah, I usually strike out
with the normal, human ones.

06:33.994 --> 06:35.528
Let's face it, I'm never
going to meet a girl.

06:35.528 --> 06:37.130
Yes, you are--
lots of them.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.066
Why should I pay five dollars
to get rejected

06:40.066 --> 06:41.701
when I do it so well
for free?

06:41.701 --> 06:43.036
Well, for every girl
that says no

06:43.036 --> 06:44.938
you're that much closer
to the one that'll say yes.

06:44.938 --> 06:46.106
Dating is a numbers game.

06:46.106 --> 06:49.609
So getting rejected by 20 girls
in one night is a good thing?

06:49.609 --> 06:52.579
Yeah. For only five bucks,
that's a bargain.

06:55.582 --> 06:58.184
I never realized what
a pack rat Salem was.

06:58.184 --> 07:00.687
It's amazing--
he saved everything.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.622
Wrapping paper;
aluminum foil...

07:02.622 --> 07:04.291
my Cartier watch.

07:04.291 --> 07:08.128
He needed something to go
with your Ferragamo handbag.

07:08.128 --> 07:10.130
Zellie, are you sure I did
the right thing with Salem?

07:10.130 --> 07:13.533
Yes, absolutely--
he was evil, selfish
and disgusting.

07:13.533 --> 07:16.469
You're right.
Good-bye and good riddance.

07:16.469 --> 07:19.372
But honestly, how cute was he
when he wore this little outfit?

07:19.372 --> 07:21.007
I loved his Shirley
Temple phase.

07:21.007 --> 07:22.442
Remember how he'd
put that on

07:22.442 --> 07:24.744
and sing "The Good
Ship Lollipop"?

07:24.744 --> 07:27.480
That cat could really
shuffle off to Buffalo.

07:27.480 --> 07:29.549
I do hope he lands
someplace nice.

07:29.549 --> 07:31.084
( <i>yelling</i> )

07:31.618 --> 07:33.420
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
Well, who are you?

07:33.420 --> 07:37.257
Salem Saberhagen, AKA "The Fist"

07:37.257 --> 07:39.359
AKA "Mr. Julian."

07:39.359 --> 07:42.162
Must be the new parolee
Harry said he was sending over.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.797
You are correct, Madame.

07:43.797 --> 07:46.666
But now if you'll kindly
show me to my quarters

07:46.666 --> 07:48.201
I'd like to freshen up

07:48.201 --> 07:51.771
before gorging
on a nice ceviche appetizer.

07:51.771 --> 07:56.176
Of course you would, yes.

07:56.176 --> 07:57.978
( <i>chuckling</i> )

07:58.044 --> 07:58.745
( <i>yells</i> )

08:01.982 --> 08:03.016
He seemed nice.

08:03.016 --> 08:04.317
Yes.

08:05.118 --> 08:06.786
Uh-oh!

08:08.421 --> 08:13.293
Something tells me this
isn't the Good Ship <i>Lollipop.</i>

08:13.293 --> 08:15.962
Welcome to Dick and Dora's
prison labor camp.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.531
My name is Snake,
and I'll be your dungeon master.

08:18.531 --> 08:21.401
Now, get sewing,
or you're going to be my lunch.

08:21.401 --> 08:23.703
( <i>whimpering</i> ):
But I don't know how to sew!

08:23.703 --> 08:24.971
( <i>growls</i> )

08:24.971 --> 08:28.875
Just give me a minute
to thread my bobbin. Heh-heh.

08:32.045 --> 08:33.346
This is going great!

08:33.346 --> 08:35.048
I mean, how cool would it be
if everyone here got dates

08:35.048 --> 08:36.616
and the Singles Night
really took off?

08:36.616 --> 08:39.519
Very cool, and
very profitable.

08:39.519 --> 08:41.821
Sabrina, you and I
have discovered a beautiful way

08:41.821 --> 08:45.325
to create meaningful,
lasting relationships.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.860
( <i>rings bell</i> )
Switch!

08:48.695 --> 08:50.296
-I'm Steve.
-I'm Erica.

08:50.296 --> 08:53.266
I know you-- you're
in my biology lab.

08:53.266 --> 08:54.367
I've been trying
to get up the nerve

08:54.367 --> 08:55.969
to talk to you all semester.

08:55.969 --> 08:58.405
I've wanted
to talk to you, too!

08:58.405 --> 08:59.439
Let's find out
if we're soul mates

08:59.439 --> 09:01.341
in the next four minutes
and 20 seconds.

09:02.375 --> 09:04.110
I think we've got a
budding romance here.

09:04.110 --> 09:05.311
Yeah, I think we do.

09:05.311 --> 09:06.746
I mean, <i>they</i> do.

09:06.746 --> 09:09.382
Well, right, yeah, them.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.052
Why don't I, uh, make sure
we have enough sugar packets?

09:12.052 --> 09:14.087
Yeah, and I'll refill
the coffee pot.

09:14.087 --> 09:16.389
As soon as it's empty.

09:16.389 --> 09:18.358
( <i>rings bell</i> )
Time!

09:22.962 --> 09:24.297
My name is Miles.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.800
Thus far we've only known
each other as roommates

09:26.800 --> 09:29.235
but I'm open to other avenues.

09:29.235 --> 09:33.039
Make a U-turn--
this road is closed.

09:33.039 --> 09:35.742
I didn't pay five bucks
to get chatted up by Miles.

09:35.742 --> 09:38.144
I want to meet
that cute guy over there.

09:38.144 --> 09:39.712
That's my friend, Brett.

09:39.712 --> 09:42.582
He should be at your table
in another four bells.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.383
( <i>ringing bell</i> )

09:52.158 --> 09:55.295
Well, the girl knows
what she wants.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.597
We may only have a
few seconds together
before the next bell.

09:57.597 --> 10:00.667
I need you to sum
up your entire being
in four words. Go.

10:00.667 --> 10:03.570
Not interested in you.

10:03.570 --> 10:06.139
Four words on the dot.

10:07.640 --> 10:09.442
Can I get a bell, please?

10:15.115 --> 10:17.383
Well, I'd call this evening
a total success.

10:17.383 --> 10:19.285
I bet more than a dozen
phone numbers were exchanged.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.287
Yeah. Roxie met
my friend Brett

10:21.287 --> 10:22.922
Miles met my
friend Holly

10:22.922 --> 10:26.025
and I met a lot
of dead presidents.

10:26.025 --> 10:27.894
So where do you want
Mr. Lincoln and his pals

10:27.894 --> 10:28.928
to take us for dinner?

10:28.928 --> 10:30.463
Well, I know
Roxie's a little bit nervous

10:30.463 --> 10:31.798
about her first date with Brett

10:31.798 --> 10:33.466
so you know maybe the four
of us and the Lincolns

10:33.466 --> 10:34.634
could go someplace together.

10:34.634 --> 10:35.902
Sounds good to me.

10:35.902 --> 10:37.337
And old Abe's up for anything.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.873
As long as we don't wind up
at the theater.

10:40.406 --> 10:42.175
I'm so excited about
going out with Brett.

10:42.175 --> 10:43.643
Thanks for double-
dating with us.

10:43.643 --> 10:45.845
How many times
do I have to tell you?
We're not dating.

10:45.845 --> 10:48.281
And how many times
do I have to tell you
that you should be?

10:48.281 --> 10:49.916
We tried it,
but it didn't work.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.885
Then he tried it,
but I just wanted to be friends.

10:51.885 --> 10:53.286
Then I tried it,
but he was dating Morgan.

10:53.286 --> 10:54.787
Which he isn't anymore.

10:54.787 --> 10:56.289
The man's coming
over to take you

10:56.289 --> 10:57.590
to a Kung Fu movie.

10:57.590 --> 11:00.760
Dead giveaway that he wants
a serious relationship.

11:00.760 --> 11:01.528
You think so?

11:01.528 --> 11:03.930
What I think is that
you two are perfect
for each other.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.999
I don't know what's holding
either of you back.

11:05.999 --> 11:07.567
( <i>knocking on door</i> )

11:07.567 --> 11:09.068
Hey, you ready?

11:09.068 --> 11:10.904
Maybe I <i>am.</i>

11:10.904 --> 11:12.338
Where's Brett?

11:12.338 --> 11:13.773
Oh, he couldn't make it.

11:13.773 --> 11:15.074
Yeah, at the last second,
his buddy got him

11:15.074 --> 11:16.776
a box seat for the Red Sox game.

11:16.776 --> 11:18.144
He told me to tell you
he's sorry.

11:18.144 --> 11:19.445
That makes two of us.

11:19.445 --> 11:22.482
Wait a minute.
Okay, Brett cancels

11:22.482 --> 11:24.083
but he doesn't bother
to call Roxie

11:24.083 --> 11:25.518
and tell her himself?

11:25.518 --> 11:27.287
Like I said, he just
got the tickets

11:27.287 --> 11:28.755
he knew I was
coming over here

11:28.755 --> 11:30.523
and I told him I'd
give Roxie the message.

11:30.523 --> 11:31.991
Which I did.

11:31.991 --> 11:33.660
Roxie, are you okay?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.828
I'll be fine.
Have a great time.

11:35.828 --> 11:37.564
Okay, we better go.

11:37.564 --> 11:39.432
You don't want to miss the
beginning of a Bruce Lee movie.

11:39.432 --> 11:41.768
The first ten minutes sets up
the whole emotional arc.

11:41.768 --> 11:43.670
Hold the phone.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.338
When Brett told you
he was canceling

11:45.338 --> 11:47.407
to go to the game,
what did you say?

11:47.407 --> 11:49.742
Uh, "Who's pitching?"

11:49.742 --> 11:52.378
You didn't say anything about,
you know, how rude he was

11:52.378 --> 11:54.347
how insensitive,
how you could never be friends

11:54.347 --> 11:57.083
with someone
who was so morally bankrupt?

11:57.083 --> 11:58.218
I felt it was implied.

11:59.018 --> 11:59.652
Now, come on

11:59.652 --> 12:00.987
we don't want to miss
that cartoon

12:00.987 --> 12:02.622
with the little dancing hot dog.

12:02.622 --> 12:04.824
See if you can get
what I'm implying.

12:04.824 --> 12:07.827
You and I aren't going
to the movies.

12:07.827 --> 12:09.562
All right, let me get
this straight, Sabrina.

12:09.562 --> 12:12.432
You think my friend
acted like a jerk,
and you're blaming me?

12:12.432 --> 12:14.133
No, I'm blaming you
'cause you don't even realize

12:14.133 --> 12:15.168
your friend acted
like a jerk.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.104
Okay, fine, Brett was
a jerk-- are you happy?

12:18.104 --> 12:20.974
You're saying that 'cause
you don't want to keep arguing.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.775
I can't argue with <i>that.</i>

12:22.909 --> 12:24.711
You know, Josh,
the scary thing about this is

12:24.711 --> 12:26.079
you're not
who I thought you were.

12:26.079 --> 12:29.582
Yes I am-- I just happen
to have a jerky friend.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.084
Miles, what do you think
about a guy

12:31.084 --> 12:32.518
who doesn't care
how a woman is treated?

12:32.518 --> 12:33.653
Well, what do you
think about a woman

12:33.653 --> 12:35.521
who blames a guy for
stuff another guy does?

12:35.521 --> 12:38.191
You both need to <i>relax.</i>

12:38.191 --> 12:41.461
This is a normal argument that
eventually all couples have.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.062
BOTH:
We're not a couple.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.564
Then stop messing with my mind.

12:44.564 --> 12:46.733
I'm going to pick up
Holly for our date.

12:46.733 --> 12:48.534
Aren't you guys supposed to
be at the Bruce Lee movie?

12:48.534 --> 12:50.370
We were until
Johnny Blackheart here

12:50.370 --> 12:51.904
decided that he didn't care

12:51.904 --> 12:54.107
if his friend treated my friend
like dirt.

12:54.107 --> 12:56.609
Oh, you are just not going
to let this go, are you?

12:56.609 --> 12:57.810
Hang on a second.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.679
You have extra tickets
to the 1971 classic

12:59.679 --> 13:01.014
<i>Han Sing Dai Hing?</i>

13:01.014 --> 13:03.249
There you go. Enjoy.

13:03.516 --> 13:06.452
On second thought,
I'm coming with you.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.520
Josh, we're not done here.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.855
Oh, yes, we are.

13:16.229 --> 13:16.929
Popcorn?

13:17.563 --> 13:19.065
No, thanks.

13:19.165 --> 13:21.701
( <i>men grunting on-screen</i> )

13:21.701 --> 13:25.338
Ugh, artificial
butter flavor, yuck!

13:25.338 --> 13:28.474
Sabrina was way out of line,
wasn't she, Miles?

13:28.474 --> 13:30.710
Hello, on a date!

13:31.177 --> 13:33.880
Legend has it that
all these guys actually die

13:33.880 --> 13:35.815
during the filming
of this scene.

13:35.815 --> 13:36.916
I mean, where does she
get off blaming me

13:36.916 --> 13:38.184
for what happened to Roxy?

13:38.184 --> 13:39.485
I didn't do anything wrong.

13:39.485 --> 13:41.587
I acted the way any other guy
would have acted.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.423
Yeah, like a jerk!

13:43.423 --> 13:44.590
Ow!

13:44.590 --> 13:46.726
I think my popcorn bit me!

13:46.726 --> 13:49.662
Shh! This is the scene
where Bruce Lee repositions

13:49.662 --> 13:52.031
the spleens of 12 lawyers
from Thailand.

13:52.031 --> 13:54.200
Now, that's a real man.

13:54.200 --> 13:56.235
I'm glad <i>you</i> think so.

13:56.235 --> 13:59.038
MAN:
Gentlemen, I was going
to reposition your spleens

13:59.038 --> 14:00.440
but I've learned
that a real man should admit

14:00.440 --> 14:02.241
when he's behaved badly,
and have the insight

14:02.241 --> 14:03.576
to urge his friends
to be more sensitive.

14:03.576 --> 14:07.347
I don't remember this
in the movie, do you?

14:08.748 --> 14:11.250
He's going to have to get back
to you on that.

14:12.218 --> 14:13.152
So.

14:13.152 --> 14:14.487
So, here we are.

14:14.487 --> 14:16.589
Isn't this wonderful?

14:16.589 --> 14:17.457
Divine.

14:17.457 --> 14:18.658
Now that Salem's
not around

14:18.658 --> 14:20.693
we can eat like
civilized witches.

14:20.693 --> 14:23.429
That's true; no more guarding
our plates against that vulture.

14:23.429 --> 14:26.032
Oh, speaking of vulture, could
you please pass the vulture?

14:26.032 --> 14:27.567
Certainly.

14:27.567 --> 14:29.736
Yes, this is
such a treat.

14:29.736 --> 14:32.372
Nobody begging for scraps...

14:32.372 --> 14:34.507
leaving whiskers
in your crème brûlée.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.710
Parading around in your
best fishnet stockings.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.412
God, I miss him!

14:39.412 --> 14:42.382
Me, too. Hilda, do you think
it would be wrong of us to...

14:42.382 --> 14:43.716
Way ahead of you.

14:46.252 --> 14:47.019
You sure you don't want

14:47.019 --> 14:48.554
to give Singles Night
another shot?

14:48.554 --> 14:49.989
We booked
a really hot band.

14:49.989 --> 14:50.757
No one wants to be

14:50.757 --> 14:53.126
at that stinking coffeehouse
less than me.

14:53.126 --> 14:55.762
Except me. Josh and I
haven't spoken in a week.

14:55.762 --> 14:58.131
I mean, he hasn't even
called to apologize.

14:58.131 --> 15:00.867
This could kill
the whole relationship.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.735
You mean the relationship
you don't have

15:02.735 --> 15:04.570
with the guy
you're not dating?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.239
Yeah. I don't
want that to end.

15:06.239 --> 15:08.975
The end of a relationship
is always the most
depressing part.

15:08.975 --> 15:10.676
But it's got to be really
depressing to end something

15:10.676 --> 15:12.678
that never got
a chance to begin.

15:12.678 --> 15:13.746
All I know is,
he should be

15:13.746 --> 15:15.214
the first one to
call and apologize.

15:15.214 --> 15:17.717
He's the one who acted like a
jerk when Brett stood you up.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.118
Is that what this is about?

15:19.118 --> 15:20.353
You're throwing away
a great guy

15:20.353 --> 15:22.688
because of someone
that never meant anything to me?

15:22.688 --> 15:24.724
It's the principle
of the thing.

15:24.724 --> 15:26.292
If you're going to date
based upon principle

15:26.292 --> 15:29.529
your choices are the Pope
or St. Francis of Assisi.

15:29.529 --> 15:30.930
So I've got options.

15:37.670 --> 15:39.372
I like
your bungalow.

15:39.372 --> 15:41.340
I like saying
"bungalow."

15:41.340 --> 15:42.942
Bungalow.

15:42.942 --> 15:44.644
Say it with me.

15:44.644 --> 15:46.512
When will Salem be back?

15:46.512 --> 15:48.981
Hard to say; he loves
splashing around

15:48.981 --> 15:51.017
( <i>chuckling</i> ):
in the estuary,
doesn't he?

15:51.017 --> 15:52.151
Yes.

15:52.151 --> 15:53.152
That's funny, you know.

15:53.152 --> 15:57.123
He never liked playing
in brackish water at our house.

15:57.123 --> 15:57.690
( <i>rhythmic clonking</i> )

15:57.690 --> 15:58.624
What's that?

15:58.624 --> 16:02.228
Uh, the boiler;
it's on the fritz again.

16:02.228 --> 16:04.564
I think it needs
to be disciplined.

16:04.564 --> 16:06.332
Are you getting
a weird feeling?

16:06.332 --> 16:08.234
No, but there's
something new
I'd like to say.

16:08.234 --> 16:10.036
Brackish water.

16:10.036 --> 16:13.506
Say it with me:
brackish water.

Sabrina, this is great!

16:48.841 --> 16:51.077
How did you get the Pop Stars
to play at Singles Night?

16:51.077 --> 16:51.944
Well, they may
have a hit series

16:51.944 --> 16:55.014
but they're looking for love
just like everyone else.

16:55.014 --> 16:57.416
All right, everybody,
for the next round

16:57.416 --> 16:59.252
the women will switch tables.

16:59.252 --> 17:01.487
Let them
do something
for a change

17:01.487 --> 17:03.422
besides hold all us
guys responsible

17:03.422 --> 17:04.957
for everything bad
that happens in the world.

17:04.957 --> 17:06.425
Oh well,maybe we wouldn't
hold you responsible

17:06.425 --> 17:07.827
if you did the right thing in
the first place.

17:07.827 --> 17:09.295
How do we have a chance do the
right thing

17:09.295 --> 17:11.197
if you blame us for stuff
that isn't even our fault?

17:11.197 --> 17:13.933
It <i>is</i> your fault; you're just
too pigheaded to admit it.

17:14.166 --> 17:14.867
What do you think

17:14.867 --> 17:16.936
Pop Stars one
through five?

17:16.936 --> 17:20.339
I think you both need
some serious therapy.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.409
Hey, Sabrina.
Hey, Josh.

17:23.409 --> 17:25.144
Miles, what are
you doing here
on Singles Night?

17:25.144 --> 17:26.178
Yeah.
Where's Holly?

17:26.178 --> 17:27.847
It's over.

17:27.847 --> 17:28.548
There's a surprise.

17:28.548 --> 17:30.082
Another one of <i>your</i>
flaky Emerson friends

17:30.082 --> 17:31.284
dumps another one of <i>my</i>
<i>roommates</i>

17:31.284 --> 17:32.552
and you don't even <i>care!</i>

17:32.552 --> 17:33.519
How do you know
I don't care?

17:33.519 --> 17:36.188
You didn't even give
me a chance to react,
and stop poking me!

17:36.188 --> 17:38.824
Actually, I broke up
with Holly.

17:38.824 --> 17:39.825
Huh?

17:40.927 --> 17:43.596
Uh, looks like I made
a little poke mark there.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.463
Yeah, that happens

17:44.463 --> 17:46.699
when you point your finger
at the wrong person.

17:47.099 --> 17:49.335
All right, Josh, you know,
maybe I jumped all over you

17:49.335 --> 17:51.704
but I'm still upset
about the Brett thing.

17:51.704 --> 17:54.173
Uh, that's not much
of an apology.

17:54.173 --> 17:54.740
What are you talking about?

17:54.740 --> 17:56.475
You're the one the one
that needs to apologize.

17:56.475 --> 17:59.278
Again? Sabrina, how many times
do I have to say I'm sorry?

17:59.278 --> 18:01.280
Until the one time
you really mean it.

18:01.280 --> 18:04.183
Boy, for a couple trying
to bring people together

18:04.183 --> 18:05.585
you're setting
a rotten example.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.086
Both:
We're <i>not</i> a couple.

18:09.221 --> 18:12.391
( <i>rhythmic clonking</i> )

18:12.391 --> 18:14.660
Where did you get
those pumps?

18:14.660 --> 18:16.629
Other Realm
Shoe Pavilion.
Do you like them?

18:16.629 --> 18:18.264
Not particularly.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.298
What you doing?

18:19.298 --> 18:21.467
Translating Morse code.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.535
I've got it.

18:22.535 --> 18:25.404
"I'm in a basement prison
cobbling shoes.

18:25.404 --> 18:27.340
Send help and ceviche.

18:27.340 --> 18:30.343
Hilda, this is an Other Realm
prison labor camp!

18:30.343 --> 18:31.944
Dick and Doris,
shame on you!

18:31.944 --> 18:32.845
Zap 'em, Dick!

18:32.845 --> 18:33.746
Watch out, Zelda!

18:41.420 --> 18:43.089
Nice work, Super Witch.

18:43.089 --> 18:44.023
You, too, Hex Kitten.

18:44.023 --> 18:45.825
Let's find Salem
and get out of here.

18:46.892 --> 18:48.394
All right, that's it!

18:48.394 --> 18:50.196
I've had enough
of you, Saberhagen.

18:50.196 --> 18:51.864
I'm famished!

18:51.864 --> 18:53.799
( <i>hissing</i> )

18:58.371 --> 18:59.305
Everybody freeze!

18:59.305 --> 19:01.040
Hilda! Zelda!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.875
Am I glad
to see you!

19:02.875 --> 19:05.144
Salem, are you all right?

19:05.144 --> 19:07.980
Hilda, let's get out of here
before Dick and Doris escape.

19:07.980 --> 19:08.881
We'll send the authorities

19:08.881 --> 19:11.050
after these wretched men.
Come on!

19:11.050 --> 19:12.752
Wait a minute.

19:13.352 --> 19:14.987
( <i>gobbling</i> )

19:16.255 --> 19:18.190
( <i>bell ringing</i> )
All right, everybody,
wrap it up.

19:18.190 --> 19:20.192
The night's over;
we're closing.

19:20.192 --> 19:22.061
Actually,
it's just beginning.

19:22.061 --> 19:24.096
I'm sorry
I only have two arms.

19:24.096 --> 19:25.498
Pop Stars?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.070
Well, at least someone
had a good time this evening.

19:31.070 --> 19:33.806
Yeah, Miles and the Pop Stars
really seemed to hit it off.

19:33.806 --> 19:36.776
Yeah, they make an attractive...
you know, whatever.

19:36.776 --> 19:40.379
So, how is it that Miles can
get along with an entire harem

19:40.379 --> 19:42.815
and you and I can't even
be civil to each other?

19:42.815 --> 19:44.283
Look, Josh, I don't want
to keep going on like this.

19:44.283 --> 19:45.151
Me, neither.

19:45.151 --> 19:46.018
Just because
I didn't like

19:46.018 --> 19:47.119
how you handled things
with Brett

19:47.119 --> 19:48.120
doesn't mean
we shouldn't be friends.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.455
I mean,we still have
to work together

19:49.455 --> 19:51.824
so we should figure out
a way to get along so...

19:53.993 --> 19:56.095
Well, that's one way.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.596
For what it's worth

19:57.596 --> 20:00.299
if I ever had to
cancel a date,
I'd call you.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.302
For what it's worth,
I hope we have a date
for you to not cancel.

20:03.302 --> 20:05.304
Well, we never did go
out for that dinner.

20:05.304 --> 20:09.208
Well, maybe we can oct-up
with Miles and his harem.

20:17.516 --> 20:20.286
These are the most comfortable
shoes I've ever had.

20:20.286 --> 20:21.454
And stylish.

20:21.454 --> 20:22.621
Oh, cobbler?

20:22.621 --> 20:24.790
Yes, ma'am!

20:24.790 --> 20:27.393
I'd like five more pairs,
one in every color.

20:27.393 --> 20:29.128
Yeah, and how are you
with matching belts?

20:29.128 --> 20:30.896
I'll cobble whatever you want.

20:30.896 --> 20:32.565
I'm just glad to be home.

20:32.565 --> 20:34.366
And we're happy
to have you home.

20:34.366 --> 20:36.969
I'm sure you learned a lesson
from your misbehavior?

20:36.969 --> 20:38.471
I'm sure I have.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.406
( <i>doorbell rings</i> )

20:44.510 --> 20:46.712
I am Mrs. Salem-san.

20:46.712 --> 20:49.515
Okay... come in.

20:49.515 --> 20:53.185
I bring you gift.

20:53.185 --> 20:55.221
Where is my husband?

20:55.221 --> 20:57.590
Meeeeow!

20:57.590 --> 20:58.424
Nobody perfect.
