WEBVTT

00:19.185 --> 00:21.938
Oh. Jenny, I don't think we need
to bring the sewing machine.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.816
If a costume rips,
we're gonna need to fix it. Fast.

00:25.316 --> 00:26.651
And hand-sewing is not an option.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.782
-Is there enough room for everything?
-Great. Oh, good. Just...

00:32.866 --> 00:34.242
[car approaching]

00:40.915 --> 00:41.833
[Ruth] What's going on?

00:42.417 --> 00:44.794
I left a million messages
with your service.

00:44.878 --> 00:47.213
Jesus! You smell like a distillery.

00:47.297 --> 00:50.383
Well, that's what happens
if you drink for three days straight.

00:51.176 --> 00:53.344
I told everyone you were
at Esalen meditating.

00:53.428 --> 00:55.430
Go shower, and meet us at the Hayworth.

00:55.513 --> 00:56.681
Wait. Why?

00:56.765 --> 01:00.393
Sam! We are making this thing. Today.

01:00.810 --> 01:02.353
Bash's mom gave us a ballroom.

01:02.437 --> 01:05.523
Jenny's doing costumes,
Sheila's on sound, I did the props.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.233
We are all hanging on by a thread.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.526
Justine's my kid.

01:10.695 --> 01:11.696
[exhales sharply]

01:12.655 --> 01:13.490
Oh.

01:13.573 --> 01:15.450
She told me at that fucking party.

01:15.825 --> 01:18.411
And I didn't--
You know, I didn't handle it well, but...

01:18.495 --> 01:21.081
That's no surprise.
But I mean, look at me. I'm no...

01:21.164 --> 01:22.874
I'm no father figure. I mean--

01:22.957 --> 01:24.584
Stop feeling sorry for yourself.

01:25.043 --> 01:25.919
Go talk to her.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.253
I don't know what to say.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.800
I mean, fuck,
I don't even know which room is hers.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.889
All right, come on. Come on. Come on.

01:41.893 --> 01:44.062
Hey, how was the meditation retreat?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.231
Whoa. What is that smell?

01:46.314 --> 01:47.482
Bourbon and despair.

01:48.149 --> 01:49.109
Where is Justine?

01:49.692 --> 01:51.361
She probably spent the night at Billy's.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.238
Billy? Who the fuck is Billy?

01:53.321 --> 01:55.406
-Oh, see, that sounded very paternal.
-Shut up.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.493
He's this guy. He delivers pizza.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.497
-Are you coming in the limo with us?
-Sam's gonna follow us there.

02:02.580 --> 02:04.582
-[Arthie] That's probably better.
-Okay. Thanks.

02:04.666 --> 02:06.543
-Great.
-[Melrose] Let me see. Give me this.

02:07.544 --> 02:10.171
Look.
She's not gonna miss shooting the pilot.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.381
[sighs]

02:11.464 --> 02:12.549
I think she's gone.

02:13.049 --> 02:14.759
I'd be gone if I were her.

02:14.843 --> 02:17.929
If she's anything like you,
she's stubborn and confrontational,

02:18.012 --> 02:19.013
so, go find her.

02:20.765 --> 02:23.685
But brush your teeth first.
I'll keep things moving.

02:26.479 --> 02:29.482
All right, ladies, get the fuck in.
I still gotta get gas.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.526
-[Stacey] Okay, let's go.
-[Melrose] Debbie!

02:31.609 --> 02:34.529
You riding with us
or taking your own horse and carriage?

02:34.612 --> 02:35.572
I'll be right back.

02:38.283 --> 02:39.868
Hey. You ready?

02:41.452 --> 02:43.538
Are you moving out? For real?

02:44.080 --> 02:47.584
I, uh-- I can't work things out with Mark
if we're not living in the same house.

02:55.633 --> 02:58.595
-We were stupid to think this would work.
-[Ruth] Just give it a shot.

02:58.678 --> 02:59.679
I can't.

02:59.762 --> 03:03.224
-Doesn't look like a friendly chat.
-You think we should go over and help?

03:03.308 --> 03:05.518
-No.
-[car door slams]

03:06.352 --> 03:07.896
[engine starts]

03:14.068 --> 03:15.820
-Is everything okay?
-Uh...

03:16.654 --> 03:18.114
Debbie's made a decision.

03:18.198 --> 03:21.618
She's getting back together with Mark.
She's bailing on the show.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.245
-Who are you gonna fight?
-I don't know.

03:26.664 --> 03:29.876
Hey, look, we'll figure it out.
Let's go make a show.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.169
[chuckles]

03:31.252 --> 03:34.380
[Dawn] Okay, we're ready to go.
Let's go! Go, get in, get in! Come on.

03:35.465 --> 03:36.466
[Carmen] Okay.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.595
All right, first song to come on,
it's an omen.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.264

What do you think, huh?

04:28.351 --> 04:31.479
Me and Florian and the bellhops
have been working on it all morning.

04:31.562 --> 04:32.397
Check this out.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.233
-Are you ready to rumble?
-[feedback squeals]

04:35.316 --> 04:36.150
Check.

04:36.234 --> 04:39.487
-We gotta deal with that mic. Sheila?
-Yep. Sound. I'm on it.

04:41.239 --> 04:44.409
Uh, hey, is the director around?
We gotta position these tripods.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.495
Oh, no. No, no, no. No tripods. Sorry.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.330
The network said they want
to keep it simple.

04:49.414 --> 04:52.417
Well, the director's
going for something a little, uh...

04:52.500 --> 04:53.418
different, you know?

04:53.501 --> 04:56.462
He wants the shots to feel... visceral.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.714
So, handheld.

04:57.797 --> 04:59.215
[Ruth] Yes. Exactly.

04:59.799 --> 05:01.050
Move around with us,

05:01.134 --> 05:03.136
uh, pace the perimeter of the ring,
both of you.

05:04.095 --> 05:06.180
If we're both
on the perimeter of the ring,

05:06.264 --> 05:08.266
you're gonna see one of us in every shot.

05:08.349 --> 05:09.517
You'll figure it out.

05:12.854 --> 05:14.522
-It's really big.
-[Dawn] Yeah.

05:14.605 --> 05:16.024
We got this.

05:16.649 --> 05:19.235
Even if we totally change our lineup,
we know the moves.

05:19.819 --> 05:22.905
And we still have two hours
to figure everything else out.

05:22.989 --> 05:24.782
That's plenty of time. And...

05:25.742 --> 05:26.617
And look.

05:26.701 --> 05:29.203
Sam said he'd get us pink ropes,
he got us pink ropes.

05:29.287 --> 05:30.788
Loving the pink ropes, buddy.

Right? Arr!

05:36.085 --> 05:38.546
Let's go find the dressing room.
Just follow me.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.339
Well...

-[Justine groans] You don't have <i>Clue</i>?
-Yeah.

05:46.512 --> 05:48.973
My mom doesn't like games
where people get killed.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.059
Monopoly might be better.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.936
[woman] Justine?
Uh, someone is here to see you.

06:02.236 --> 06:03.446
You kids want anything?

06:03.529 --> 06:05.073
No. Thanks, Mom.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.450
-I'll take some coffee.
-Oh.

06:07.950 --> 06:08.785
Thank you.

06:10.745 --> 06:11.829
How did you find me?

06:11.913 --> 06:14.540
I called the pizza place.
I ordered a pizza.

06:14.624 --> 06:17.585
I shook down the kid who brought it,
and he sang like a canary.

06:19.003 --> 06:20.713
So, you must be the famous Billy.

06:21.881 --> 06:24.383
Relax with the standing
and sticking your chest out.

06:24.467 --> 06:25.676
I'm just here to talk.

06:25.760 --> 06:27.428
I don't have anything to say to you.

06:27.512 --> 06:30.014
Look, I'm sorry I tried to fuck you, okay?

06:30.098 --> 06:33.684
If you'd told me you were my daughter,
I would never have done that.

06:36.395 --> 06:37.563
Milk? Sugar?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.565
Oh, uh, black. Thank you.

06:41.192 --> 06:42.735
So, this is my fault.

06:42.819 --> 06:45.947
Look, I get that there's no great way
to deliver this news, okay?

06:46.030 --> 06:47.532
[stammers] But coming out here

06:47.615 --> 06:50.409
and pretending to audition
for a show that I'm directing,

06:50.493 --> 06:53.371
and then following me around
like some crazed fangirl,

06:53.454 --> 06:57.083
I mean, definitely, you know,
made it, you know, worse.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.960
That's all I'm saying.

07:00.586 --> 07:01.420
I just...

07:03.131 --> 07:04.382
wanted to meet you.

07:05.216 --> 07:06.300
That was it.

07:06.384 --> 07:08.719
That was all I'd figured out.
It wasn't like...

07:09.303 --> 07:11.222
some diabolical plan.

07:12.223 --> 07:14.934
[sighs] Is your name really Justine?

07:15.518 --> 07:18.521
Yes. Justine Victoria Biagi.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.524
That's a nice name.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.945
So, are you coming to the show?

07:26.696 --> 07:29.240
We've got a ballroom
or something down at the Hayworth.

07:29.323 --> 07:31.284
I don't actually care about wrestling.

07:31.534 --> 07:33.536
I didn't do any of this
so I could wrestle.

07:35.371 --> 07:36.205
All right.

07:37.290 --> 07:38.458
Well, listen, kid.

07:39.041 --> 07:41.711
It can only get better from here.

07:42.503 --> 07:43.337
I think.

07:44.172 --> 07:45.173
I hope.

07:45.882 --> 07:47.508
That's what I'm holding on to.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.098
Okay.

07:55.475 --> 07:56.309
I get it.

08:01.606 --> 08:03.608
Have to take a rain check on that coffee.

08:03.691 --> 08:04.817
Lovely home, though.

08:05.818 --> 08:06.777
It's very nice.

08:08.821 --> 08:11.032
[door opens, closes]

08:12.909 --> 08:13.910
That looks crazy.

08:14.535 --> 08:16.662
It's theatrical. It's a glitter unibrow.

08:16.746 --> 08:19.332
-I like it.
-Yeah. I like it, too. [clears throat]

08:19.415 --> 08:21.083
I don't like it at all. It looks crazy.

08:21.167 --> 08:22.752
Oh, yeah. What are we gonna do?

08:22.835 --> 08:26.130
When you're done with hair and makeup,
check with Jenny about costumes.

08:26.214 --> 08:29.175
-If you're waiting, stretch with Cherry.
-Who put you in charge?

08:29.258 --> 08:31.719
-Why? You wanna do it?
-You're doing great, Captain.

08:31.802 --> 08:32.803
[Rhonda] Hey, Ruth.

08:33.304 --> 08:34.180
Yeah?

08:34.263 --> 08:36.140
Is, um... is Sam okay?

08:36.557 --> 08:40.394
Well, I wouldn't say "okay,"
but he'll be fine. It's Sam. [chuckles]

08:40.978 --> 08:42.230
-Okay.
-[Bash] Whoo! All right!

08:42.313 --> 08:44.315
Those mics are hotter than Kelly LeBrock.

08:44.398 --> 08:46.067
Where's Sam?
Does he wanna test the levels?

08:46.150 --> 08:48.277
Uh, Sam had a family emergency.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.112
What? He doesn't have any family.

08:50.196 --> 08:53.658
That's the emergency.
So, we're gonna need you to announce.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.037
-I know, it's kind of a curveball, but--
-[Bash] No.

08:58.621 --> 09:00.331
I brought my tuxedo. [chuckles]

09:01.123 --> 09:03.125
I... I was born for this moment.

09:03.709 --> 09:04.877
Great. [chuckles]

09:04.961 --> 09:06.963
-Uh, so, I wrote all your lines--
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.757
I'll probably embroider these a tad,
but, uh-- Whoa.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.094
Since when does this thing end
with a tag-team match?

09:14.011 --> 09:14.887
[Melrose] Okay.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.349
Oh, don't let anyone see you.

09:21.352 --> 09:23.104
[Tammé] Told you we were in trouble.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.523
I was the audience coordinator
for <i>Family Feud.</i>

09:25.606 --> 09:28.317
You want people to sit,
you gotta give 'em something.

09:29.402 --> 09:31.112
Okay. I have 300 cash in my bag.

09:31.654 --> 09:34.865
I have the money from the car wash,
minus $5 for ice cream.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.705
[Melrose] Good. Come on, come on, come on!

09:40.788 --> 09:42.790
All right. Guys, you guys!

09:42.873 --> 09:44.667
All right, who wants to make ten bucks?
Huh?

09:44.750 --> 09:46.210
Who here likes women's wrestling?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.920
$10-- all you have to do is sit.

09:48.004 --> 09:52.341
Fuck this time travel shit, okay?
This movie's sold out till midnight.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.342
What are you?

09:53.426 --> 09:55.553
We're the Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.306
If you wanna see more,
you're gonna have to take this money

09:59.015 --> 10:01.559
and meet me across the street
at the Hayworth.

10:03.269 --> 10:05.271
[crowd chattering]

10:38.929 --> 10:40.181
American-made piece of shit!

10:40.264 --> 10:42.183
Whoa. Save it for the ring, all right?

10:42.892 --> 10:44.852
Hey, Glen! See you out there.

10:44.935 --> 10:46.395
[chuckles] Okay.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.649
Hello, Detective Chambers.

10:50.524 --> 10:52.151
-What?
-You didn't hear it from me,

10:52.234 --> 10:53.861
but you knocked it out of the park.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.030
I got the part?

10:56.781 --> 10:57.948
My lips are sealed,

10:58.032 --> 11:00.326
but they're setting up a costume fitting
for you next week.

11:01.285 --> 11:03.621
You'll have to give Sam
and Bash some notice.

11:04.705 --> 11:06.540
Wait, what? I can't do both?

11:06.624 --> 11:07.833
No. No.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.418
[laughs] How would that work?

11:09.502 --> 11:12.171
It'd be too confusing for the audience,
you know?

11:12.254 --> 11:13.798
One minute you're fighting crime,

11:13.881 --> 11:17.218
the next minute you're getting
your behind kicked in the ring. [chuckles]

11:17.301 --> 11:19.303
-[chuckles]
-[Glen] So, all right.

11:19.387 --> 11:22.932
Uh, not-- Not peeping,
just saying good luck, everyone.

11:23.015 --> 11:25.309
Have fun out there. [chuckles]

11:29.480 --> 11:31.857
[crowd murmuring]

11:36.028 --> 11:37.613
Are you ready?

11:38.656 --> 11:39.490
[chuckles]

11:39.573 --> 11:41.283
Welcome to the world premiere

11:41.367 --> 11:43.953
-of the <i>Gorgeous Ladies of Wrest</i>--
-[feedback squeals]

11:44.036 --> 11:44.995
Goddamnit.

11:46.705 --> 11:48.124
[man] This is bullshit!

11:49.166 --> 11:54.755
Welcome to the world premiere
of the <i>Gorgeous Ladies of Wrestling!</i>

11:55.381 --> 11:57.675
Ladies and gentlemen,
please take your seats.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.219
We're about to begin our live taping.

12:01.178 --> 12:02.471
Ignore the cameras.

12:02.555 --> 12:06.976
Uh, cheer, boo, stand up.
Be a part of our show.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.269
[woman boos]

12:10.312 --> 12:13.190
[Jenny] Rhonda, you have to stay still.
I can't get this.

12:13.274 --> 12:15.693
I don't understand
how you got this so stuck.

12:15.776 --> 12:19.530
[Bash] ...the smartest woman in the world,
Britannica!

12:19.613 --> 12:23.075
Oh, shit. That's me.
It's fine! I gotta go!

12:24.118 --> 12:26.036
[rock music playing over speakers]

12:26.120 --> 12:27.204
[crowd cheering]

12:27.288 --> 12:33.836
[Bash] Fun fact: Britannica's brain is
four pounds heavier than the average girl.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.339
And with her, as always,
is her trusted GLOW-bot.

12:38.132 --> 12:39.550
Thanks a bunch, GLOW-bot.

12:42.219 --> 12:45.055
Oh, no! I dropped my book. [giggles]

12:45.139 --> 12:48.893
Oh! Oh!

12:49.768 --> 12:56.233
And her opponent today, from the dusty,
dangerous deserts of Lebanon,

12:56.317 --> 12:59.111
the terrorist Beirut.

12:59.195 --> 13:00.571
[ululating]

13:00.654 --> 13:02.490
[Arabian music playing over speakers]

13:02.573 --> 13:04.158
[crowd booing]

13:04.241 --> 13:06.869
Oh, look at that dirty sand rat.

13:06.952 --> 13:09.079
She's come to kill.

13:09.163 --> 13:12.541
-Be warned. She'll do anything to win.
-Bah!

13:12.625 --> 13:15.961
She'll hijack this whole dang match
if she has to.

13:16.879 --> 13:17.755
[growls]

13:19.757 --> 13:22.426
Here she is, stepping into the ring.

13:23.010 --> 13:24.261
[yells]

13:24.345 --> 13:25.679
[crowd booing]

13:25.763 --> 13:27.348
-[bell rings]
-[Arthie laughs maniacally]

13:27.431 --> 13:32.686
But here comes Britannica,
a genius in and out of the ring.

13:32.770 --> 13:37.024
-Brains, beauty, brawn. Triple threat.
-[Rhonda gasps]

13:37.107 --> 13:38.025
[crowd jeering]

13:38.108 --> 13:40.736
[Rhonda screams, growls]

13:42.905 --> 13:45.407
Britannica! Terrorist!

13:45.491 --> 13:47.451
-Break her arms! Break her arms!
-Yeah!

13:47.535 --> 13:49.662
Get up and take it!

13:49.745 --> 13:51.205
-[groans]
-[crowd] Oh!

13:52.081 --> 13:55.000
That mad bomber has escaped her clutches.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.419
[groans]

13:58.671 --> 13:59.838
Get out of there!

14:04.426 --> 14:06.053
[screams]

14:06.136 --> 14:08.097
-[Bash] Holy Toledo!
-[ululating]

14:08.180 --> 14:12.518
Beirut's signature move,
the Lebanese Cannonball.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.937
-[growls]
-[man 1] Fuck you, terrorist!

14:15.521 --> 14:16.564
[spits]

14:17.147 --> 14:18.232
Oh! Uh--

14:18.315 --> 14:21.861
And we've got some animated fans
in the audience.

14:21.944 --> 14:22.820
Dirty towelhead!

14:22.903 --> 14:24.154
[man 2] Fuck you!

14:24.238 --> 14:26.574
[crowd booing]

14:27.408 --> 14:29.618
And it looks like evil's winning today.

14:29.702 --> 14:31.620
Go back to the Middle East, dune coon.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.248
-[Rhonda grunts]
-Oh!

14:34.331 --> 14:37.418
We've got a beer drinker here
tonight, folks.

14:37.501 --> 14:38.836
-Fuck you!
-[Bash] That's okay.

14:38.919 --> 14:40.337
We're having a good time.

14:40.421 --> 14:42.840
What the fuck is your problem, man?
Y'all got to go.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.884
-Screw you.
-You don't want me to come out.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.261
I will fuck you up, baldy.
And you, Gregg Allman.

14:50.097 --> 14:51.724
-Ah.
-Sorry.

14:51.807 --> 14:53.058
Hold still, hold still.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.019
-It's kind of deep.
-[groans]

14:55.436 --> 14:57.730
Oh, God. That was so intense.

14:59.106 --> 15:00.858
Everyone really hated me.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.694
All those people hated me.

15:04.278 --> 15:06.655
Yeah, but that's a good thing, though.
Right?

15:10.326 --> 15:11.577
[crowd cheering]

15:11.660 --> 15:12.620
Oh!

15:12.703 --> 15:15.873
Looks like Vicky Viking's
taking a real ax-kicking today.

15:15.956 --> 15:16.790
Am I right?

15:16.874 --> 15:20.753
And this match is heating up hotter
than a hot spring in the desert.

15:20.920 --> 15:22.296
Hey, Glen.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.632
[both yelling]

15:24.715 --> 15:27.843
[Bash] And the barbarian has taken
the upper hand.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.763
[Keith] Hey. Come on, no kicking.
No kicking. She's in the corner.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.348
Viking vag!

15:33.098 --> 15:34.099
[yelling]

15:34.725 --> 15:37.019
Hey. Get out of that corner.

15:37.102 --> 15:39.980
Now, that is a humiliating move,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:40.064 --> 15:41.440
The Bronco Buster.

15:42.191 --> 15:44.068
[screaming]

15:44.151 --> 15:45.152
[Keith] Come on, come on.

15:45.235 --> 15:48.489
[Bash] Will Junkchain be able
to hippity-hip-hop her way

15:48.572 --> 15:50.491
out of this Nordic nightmare?

15:50.574 --> 15:52.451
You okay? Let me check you out.

15:52.534 --> 15:53.577
I got the part.

15:53.661 --> 15:56.372
Oh, my God.
I'm too excited to concentrate.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.831
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

15:57.915 --> 16:00.250
Are you kidding me? It's a leading role.

16:00.334 --> 16:03.087
As soon as this is over, we gonna party.
We gonna celebrate.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.713
-Can we do this?
-Yeah, let's go.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.131
-Come on.
-Let's go.

16:06.215 --> 16:07.841
[Bash] These two warriors go back at it.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.553
She needs to be ready in five minutes.

16:11.637 --> 16:13.722
-She needs to stop blinking.
-I'm not.

16:13.806 --> 16:16.141
-You are. You're like an epileptic.
-[Ruth] Hey.

16:16.225 --> 16:17.393
How you doing?

16:17.476 --> 16:19.728
[inhales sharply]
It's a big crowd out there.

16:20.980 --> 16:21.814
Yup.

16:23.607 --> 16:24.858
At the beginning of every play,

16:25.567 --> 16:27.695
I pick something in the audience
to look at.

16:27.778 --> 16:30.322
A funny shirt, a broken chairback.

16:30.406 --> 16:33.492
Then I focus all my attention on it,
like a laser beam.

16:33.993 --> 16:34.868
It helps.

16:34.952 --> 16:37.371
Or I could take one of Bash's Quaaludes.
[chuckles]

16:37.955 --> 16:38.789
He offered.

16:40.082 --> 16:43.419
[Bash] Our third match tonight is a doozy.

16:43.502 --> 16:45.629
Beauty versus the Beast.

16:45.713 --> 16:51.051
From the neon streets of Hollywood,
weighing in at 103 pounds...

16:51.135 --> 16:55.097
-I love my fans.
-[Bash] Say hello to Melrose!

16:55.180 --> 16:56.640
[Melrose] Don't fucking drop me.

16:57.683 --> 16:59.268
[man] I think I love you!

16:59.351 --> 17:00.936
[Melrose] I love you, too.

17:01.020 --> 17:03.188
[Bash] Well, it's a full moon tonight,

17:03.272 --> 17:05.482
and that means it's time
to unleash the Beast.

17:05.566 --> 17:09.903
-[wolf howling over speakers]
-[Bash] Howl for Sheila the She-Wolf.

17:09.987 --> 17:11.989
[Sheila growling]

17:16.326 --> 17:20.205
[Bash] Oh, she's escaped! Oh, my God!
The She-Wolf is on the loose!

17:20.289 --> 17:21.290
[Sheila yells]

17:23.834 --> 17:25.711
[both grunting]

17:25.794 --> 17:30.049
This isn't a beauty contest anymore.
This is a wrestling match.

17:30.132 --> 17:31.175
[both grunting]

17:32.718 --> 17:34.178
[crowd gasping]

17:34.261 --> 17:37.973
And the She-Wolf just fed the party girl
a turnbuckle sandwich.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.017
[crowd cheering]

17:41.769 --> 17:44.146
[Bash] We're having a great time
here today, folks.

17:44.855 --> 17:46.774
Welcome to <i>GLOW</i>, baby.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.657
Shot of tequila. Thank you.

17:59.286 --> 18:01.580
Hey. What the hell are you doing out here?

18:01.663 --> 18:05.167
You're the fucking title match.
I mean, get backstage, get dressed.

18:05.250 --> 18:09.088
Well, Sam, you left,
so, everyone had to make decisions.

18:09.171 --> 18:10.422
What are you talking about?

18:10.506 --> 18:14.134
I mean, this whole thing builds
to the US versus Russia.

18:14.218 --> 18:15.969
Ruth has a whole contingency plan.

18:16.053 --> 18:18.764
-Trust me. It'll be fine.
-Is she gonna wrestle Keith?

18:18.847 --> 18:20.432
Relax. Ruth could wrestle herself

18:20.516 --> 18:22.351
-and be entertaining.
-You're a quitter.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.644
<i>I'm </i>a quitter?

18:25.104 --> 18:27.981
[Bash] And it looks like She-Wolf
wins the match.

18:28.065 --> 18:28.982
[bell rings]

18:29.066 --> 18:30.609
Can we get this guy some coffee?

18:30.692 --> 18:33.445
[Bash] And now a quick word
from our sponsor.

18:33.946 --> 18:36.824
-Who here wants to save, save, save?
-[man] Shut up!

18:36.907 --> 18:39.827
Are we gonna stay for the second half?
Wanna get some dinner?

18:39.910 --> 18:40.911
No. What?

18:41.370 --> 18:45.457
No, I wanna stay and support the girls.
They worked really hard.

18:45.833 --> 18:46.834
Really?

18:47.626 --> 18:48.752
[Mark scoffs]

18:48.836 --> 18:52.089
I am just trying to keep an open mind.
This is just kind of silly.

18:53.507 --> 18:54.800
Wow. Silly.

18:57.219 --> 19:00.222
Yeah, that's exactly what you said
about <i>Paradise Cove</i>.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.434
[Bash] Welcome back to the second half
of our show, ladies and gentlemen.

19:05.102 --> 19:07.229
From the South Side of Chicago,

19:07.312 --> 19:11.275
and the Ubamba province of Peru,
respectively,

19:11.358 --> 19:15.028
Welfare Queen and Machu Picchu!

19:15.112 --> 19:16.572
[crowd cheering]

19:21.827 --> 19:23.579
[woman] You're beautiful!

19:23.662 --> 19:27.291
Smells like donkey doo in here. Mm!

19:27.374 --> 19:28.834
[panting]

19:30.752 --> 19:33.297
Looks like Machu's got, uh...

19:33.380 --> 19:37.551
just a touch
of the infamous Peruvian jungle fever.

19:38.302 --> 19:42.055
Will she recover in time
to fight Welfare Queen...

19:42.431 --> 19:46.560
this liberal leech,
this, uh, parasite on our economy?

19:46.643 --> 19:50.355
Machu! Machu! Machu!

19:50.439 --> 19:52.399
[crowd] Machu! Machu! Machu!

19:52.482 --> 19:59.114
And the crowd is chanting.
Machu! Machu! Machu! Machu!

19:59.198 --> 20:02.326
Machu! Machu! Machu!

20:02.409 --> 20:06.163
Machu! Machu! Machu!

20:06.246 --> 20:08.332
Machu! Machu! Machu!

20:15.088 --> 20:16.298
[Bash] I can't believe it.

20:16.381 --> 20:20.135
The fever has broken,
and Machu grabs Welfare Queen.

20:20.219 --> 20:21.553
[grunting]

20:26.266 --> 20:28.602
-[Bash] Whacka whacka whammo!
-Yeah.

20:29.311 --> 20:31.855
Welfare Queen is pulling something
out of her costume.

20:31.939 --> 20:33.190
What is that? Is that...?

20:33.273 --> 20:34.524
It's food stamps.

20:34.608 --> 20:38.487
I get so much money from the government,
I just throw it away.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.739
[Keith] Hey, come on, now.
Good people could use those.

20:40.822 --> 20:41.740
[Bash] Oh, my goodness.

20:41.823 --> 20:45.494
She is literally shoving
her socialist welfare policy

20:45.577 --> 20:47.704
down Machu's throat!

20:49.873 --> 20:50.958
Ha!

20:51.041 --> 20:52.751
[crowd booing]

20:52.834 --> 20:54.211
Y'all afraid of me, right?

20:55.045 --> 20:59.508
Do you believe what President Reagan says?
That I'm cheating the system?

20:59.591 --> 21:04.972
I think Welfare Queen is trying
to bore Machu into submission.

21:05.430 --> 21:06.598
And it's working.

21:06.682 --> 21:08.684
[both grunting]

21:16.900 --> 21:18.568
[yelling]

21:23.365 --> 21:26.034
-[Carmen] Come on! Come on!
-[crowd cheering]

21:29.204 --> 21:30.372
[Bash] She's down.

21:34.418 --> 21:38.046
Machu needs to get up,
or this fight is over.

21:40.590 --> 21:42.217
Come on. You got this.

21:46.680 --> 21:48.015
[Carmen screams]

21:50.559 --> 21:52.269
[Tammé] Machu, put me down!

21:52.352 --> 21:53.478
Yeah.

21:54.563 --> 21:57.065
And she finished her off
with a Power Bomb.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.944
Unbelievable! The Incan giant has won!

22:01.611 --> 22:05.574
Goodness prevails.
Justice has been restored.

22:05.657 --> 22:06.491
I won!

22:08.118 --> 22:09.369
Yes!

22:09.453 --> 22:10.787
[bell rings]

22:11.371 --> 22:13.123
[Sam] What are these camera guys doing?

22:13.206 --> 22:16.251
You're in each other's shots.
Get-- Just...

22:18.211 --> 22:19.171
Jesus Christ.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.719
Next time maybe you should give them
some direction.

22:30.140 --> 22:31.641
Yeah, well, next time...

22:32.476 --> 22:34.728
don't fucking run away
so I have to come looking for you

22:34.811 --> 22:37.689
when I'm supposed to be directing
a goddamn television show.

22:41.401 --> 22:43.862
-[Justine] Costumes look good.
-[Sam] Yeah. Who the fuck knows?

22:45.363 --> 22:46.364
Might cut together.

22:47.199 --> 22:48.033
Maybe.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.579
-You wanna make out again?
-What?

22:52.662 --> 22:54.623
Kidding. Jeez.

23:04.800 --> 23:10.097
And now the final showdown
for the first ever GLOW crown.

23:11.056 --> 23:14.184
In one corner, from Bolshevik Russia

23:14.267 --> 23:17.979
and the rice paddies of China,
respectively,
