MAN: Better here?

00:52.428 --> 00:53.469
Or better here?

00:55.931 --> 00:58.891
Better here?
Or better here?

00:58.976 --> 01:00.309
You don't want to be
walking around blind

01:00.477 --> 01:02.145
at Christmas, Mrs. Ryor.
Help me out.

01:02.646 --> 01:04.397
I don't
need glasses.

01:04.480 --> 01:07.525
You need binoculars.
We're settling for glasses.

01:08.152 --> 01:09.444
Better one...

01:09.528 --> 01:11.487
Glasses will
make me look old.

01:20.831 --> 01:22.165
Try these.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.508
I look hot.

01:37.264 --> 01:38.431
Evening,
Father Bruce.

01:38.515 --> 01:39.891
Hello,
Dr. Finch.

01:41.226 --> 01:43.019
Hello, Mrs. Patterson.
Hello, Dr. Finch.

01:51.445 --> 01:52.820
Dr. Finch!

01:52.946 --> 01:54.280
Hello, Gustave, Gerta.

01:54.364 --> 01:55.573
I'd love to chat
and so,

01:55.699 --> 01:57.575
but you know how focused
Gerta gets on our runs.

01:58.368 --> 01:59.660
Oh, Gerta!

01:59.745 --> 02:00.745
(SPEAKING GERMAN)

02:02.206 --> 02:03.372
Auf Wiedersehen.

02:03.457 --> 02:06.959
Auf Wiedersehen.
You should maybe
get that looked at.

02:07.044 --> 02:08.252
And start wearing
some padding.

02:08.336 --> 02:09.419
GUSTAVE: Gut, gut, gut.

02:09.505 --> 02:11.964
Yes, well, I'm sure it's
more fun your way, Arturo,

02:12.049 --> 02:14.133
but I need you to
hang the decorations,

02:14.218 --> 02:15.968
not just chuck 'em up there
and hope they stick.

02:16.053 --> 02:17.094
Hey. Steve.

02:17.221 --> 02:18.304
Mayor Young.

02:18.388 --> 02:20.306
What do you think?
Lookin' good.

02:20.390 --> 02:21.557
Thank you.

02:21.725 --> 02:22.850
Is that...
Is that an angel on top?

02:22.935 --> 02:25.645
(CHUCKLES) It's supposed
to be, but we couldn't
find one big enough.

02:25.729 --> 02:27.939
Fortunately my wife has
a porcelain doll collection,

02:28.023 --> 02:29.565
so she lent us
her Marilyn Monroe.

02:29.817 --> 02:32.151
Nice touch.
Looks good.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.987
Yeah. Don't go overboard
with the lights though.
We don't want to seem tacky.

02:35.072 --> 02:37.698
Whatever you say, Steve.
Winterfest is your baby.
Hey, hey.

02:37.783 --> 02:39.659
We got any big surprises
this year?

02:39.743 --> 02:43.454
Come on. Come on. Nobody
keeps a secret better
than me. For instance...

02:44.331 --> 02:46.165
(CLEARS THROAT)
I know for a fact,

02:46.250 --> 02:48.751
Sheriff Dave
is a cross-dresser.

02:49.253 --> 02:51.170
I never told a soul.

02:51.255 --> 02:53.297
Until today.

03:37.342 --> 03:39.135
Hi, honey. I'm home.

03:42.014 --> 03:43.764
It's the raw
quail eggs, isn't it?

03:43.849 --> 03:46.976
It's the texture, right?
The grainy, slimy, milky...

03:47.311 --> 03:48.603
Can you taste the curry?

03:48.729 --> 03:50.021
Yeah. Yeah.

03:51.106 --> 03:53.274
Gee, I sure hope
there's more of that.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.484
You are such a bad liar.

03:56.153 --> 03:58.154
I knew it was awful.
It's awful, right?

03:58.739 --> 03:59.822
Yeah.

04:00.449 --> 04:01.490
Who wants pizza?

04:04.161 --> 04:06.954
My life just isn't
working out the way
I thought it would.

04:07.039 --> 04:08.080
Excuse me?

04:08.165 --> 04:10.249
Oh, honey,
you don't mean that.

04:10.334 --> 04:12.543
I'm 10, and
what have I really
accomplished?

04:13.086 --> 04:14.629
A half season
of soccer.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.173
Cleared legendary
mode of Halo.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.259
A lackluster stint
in the Cub Scouts.

04:20.761 --> 04:23.179
Hey. Hey.
Guess what day it is.

04:23.680 --> 04:24.680
Come on. Guess.

04:25.223 --> 04:26.390
Maddy.

04:26.475 --> 04:28.559
I don't know,
and I don't care.

04:29.019 --> 04:30.186
Wrong.

04:31.188 --> 04:32.772
It's December 1.

04:33.857 --> 04:35.066
(GROANS)

04:35.776 --> 04:36.984
KELLY: Oh!

04:37.069 --> 04:39.153
Time to break out
the Christmas calendar.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.864
Yes.
This is a busy time of year,

04:42.032 --> 04:43.908
so we have to
have a game plan.

04:44.701 --> 04:47.828
Okay. December 3,
we hang the wreath.

04:50.624 --> 04:52.500
You just get so intense
about Christmas.

04:52.584 --> 04:55.294
I'm not intense.
I'm just extremely organized.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.796
When you're talking about
Christmas caroling,

04:56.880 --> 04:59.382
you shouldn't have
to use the term
"flanking maneuver."

04:59.508 --> 05:02.635
Look. Look,
I know it's only December 1...
Uh-huh.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.179
...but I have all
the planning to do
for the Winterfest.

05:05.263 --> 05:08.057
You have a cookbook to write.
The kids have school.

05:08.141 --> 05:10.434
It all goes by
so quickly.

05:10.519 --> 05:12.061
Before you know it,
Christmas will be over.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.647
Yeah, but that doesn't
mean that we have to
plan every second.

05:15.023 --> 05:18.526
Look. My dad dragged me
from one air force base
to another.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.444
Christmas was not
a priority for him.

05:20.570 --> 05:22.405
We...
We didn't even have a tree.

05:22.906 --> 05:24.991
Well, I want things
to be different
for my kids.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.661
I want them to have
big family traditions,
year after year,

05:28.745 --> 05:31.747
that they can
count on and...
And look forward to.

05:32.249 --> 05:33.708
You're right.

05:34.543 --> 05:36.377
I'm gonna try to
be more supportive.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.337
Well, you should be.

05:38.547 --> 05:41.590
Madison is a loner.
She has hardly any friends.

05:42.759 --> 05:46.262
Carter's a
10-year-old boy
with a midlife crisis.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.973
Let's face it.
Our kids are
a little weird.

05:49.766 --> 05:52.351
Well, I think
this year they need
Christmas more than ever.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.395
You're right.

05:54.980 --> 05:57.064
I'm sorry. You're right.

05:58.942 --> 06:03.404
Snowmen, eggnog,
caroling, we're gonna
do it all, okay?

06:03.488 --> 06:04.613
Okay.

06:14.291 --> 06:15.791
And I don't
write cookbooks.

06:16.918 --> 06:18.044
What?

06:18.128 --> 06:21.130
You always say that
I write cookbooks,
but I don't.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.132
I just edit
other people's recipes,

06:23.216 --> 06:26.052
and then I compile them
into cookbooks
that nobody buys.

06:26.136 --> 06:27.887
Then write your own.
Oh, great.

06:27.971 --> 06:30.890
So all the rejection
would just be more
personal? No, thank you.

06:30.974 --> 06:32.933
Well, I think you should.
Really?

06:33.018 --> 06:35.519
Yeah. I think you could.
Really?

06:35.604 --> 06:36.687
Sure.

06:37.814 --> 06:39.356
(TRUCK APPROACHING)

06:41.318 --> 06:42.902
What is that?

06:43.028 --> 06:44.570
Is it a truck?

06:44.654 --> 06:46.155
I don't know.

(TRUCK ENGINE SPUTTERING)

06:56.500 --> 06:58.125
KELLY:
Ooh, it looks like
we have new neighbors.

06:58.210 --> 07:00.920
Who moves in
the middle of the night?
A meth lab?

07:04.132 --> 07:05.883
How bad could it be?

07:09.346 --> 07:10.346
Hmm.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.228
(MUTTERING)

07:17.312 --> 07:18.479
Okay.

07:39.668 --> 07:40.709
Oh! Oh! Ow!

07:40.794 --> 07:41.961
Whoa, big guy.

07:42.045 --> 07:43.587
Take it easy.
Hot, hot. Hot.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.923
You're spazzin' out
on me. You're havin'
a seizure.

07:46.007 --> 07:49.969
Oh. I got Tasered once.
It looked exactly like that.

07:50.053 --> 07:52.805
And I'm man enough
to say I wet myself.

07:52.889 --> 07:53.889
Who are you?

07:54.224 --> 07:57.184
I'm Buddy Hall.
We just moved in
across the street.

07:57.602 --> 07:59.812
You don't happen to
have a cat, do you?
No.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.022
Oh, good. Because I was
moving in last night,

08:02.107 --> 08:04.233
I accidentally dropped
a fridge on one.

08:04.317 --> 08:06.193
Thank God most
of it got away.

08:06.278 --> 08:08.028
Buddy!
Tia!

08:08.488 --> 08:09.697
Come on over and meet...
Hey.

08:09.781 --> 08:11.574
What's your name?
Finch. Steve Finch,

08:11.658 --> 08:12.950
but this isn't
really a very good time.

08:13.076 --> 08:14.410
Come and meet Steve.

08:14.494 --> 08:15.494
Good morning!
Hi.

08:15.579 --> 08:19.915
Oh, well, Steve,
you have a way
with the ladies.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.084
Thanks.
Oh, um, thank you.

08:22.169 --> 08:23.377
My wife, Kelly.
This is Buddy.

08:23.503 --> 08:24.670
Kelly. Very nice
to meet you.

08:24.754 --> 08:25.921
Nice to meet you.
Honey,

08:26.006 --> 08:28.090
I measured. The ceiling's
too low in the bedroom.

08:28.425 --> 08:29.675
We're gonna have to
get a shorter pole.

08:29.759 --> 08:31.010
(BUDDY GROANS)

08:31.094 --> 08:32.635
Morning.
Hi.

08:32.761 --> 08:35.014
Oh, what'd he do,
try to steal your paper?

08:35.097 --> 08:36.974
No. I was just
being neighborly.

08:37.058 --> 08:39.518
Oh, leave you alone
for five minutes...
(MURMURS)

we got a visitor.

Oh!

08:44.608 --> 08:47.276
Don't put
the little guy away
on my account.

08:49.654 --> 08:52.323

08:52.407 --> 08:53.532
Hi. So nice to meet you.
Hi.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.825
You too.

08:54.910 --> 08:56.577
You have kids, right?
We do.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.037
Why don't you
come on over,

08:58.121 --> 09:00.289
and we should talk
about maybe starting
a carpool or somethin'.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.457
That sounds great.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.541
Welcome.
TIA: Thank you.

Bye.

you're making me do this.

stop and say hello.

09:19.684 --> 09:20.726
Hello?

09:20.810 --> 09:25.231
Oh. Good. Oh, honey,
could you come over here
and give me a little boost?

09:25.649 --> 09:27.358
Oh, sure.
Seriously, sweetie.

09:27.484 --> 09:29.235
I'm about to
break my neck here.

09:29.319 --> 09:31.695
Just yank it up there.
Yeah. Just...
Yeah. A little bit harder.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.405
Oh.
More. Up.

09:33.490 --> 09:34.490
(YELPS)

09:35.158 --> 09:36.659
There you go.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.161
Whoo! That's one way
to get acquainted, huh?

09:39.246 --> 09:40.871
Oh, uh, these are for you.

09:41.456 --> 09:42.790
Oh, thank you.

09:42.874 --> 09:44.667
Oh, I love blueberry.

09:45.335 --> 09:46.919
Right to the hip.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.172
And who do
we have here?

09:50.298 --> 09:51.507
This is Madison.

09:51.841 --> 09:53.050
Say hello, Madison.

09:53.176 --> 09:54.468
Hello, Madison.

09:55.303 --> 09:57.012
She's 15.
You know how they get.

09:57.097 --> 09:58.931

Fifteen?

09:59.015 --> 10:00.641
My girls are 15.

10:01.393 --> 10:04.270
Girls,
get your butts down here!
We've got company!

10:04.521 --> 10:05.562
Carter. Carter.

10:05.689 --> 10:06.689
(GASPS)

10:06.856 --> 10:07.856
You're staring.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.275
Oh. Oh.

10:09.985 --> 10:12.319
Sorry about that.
I used to do
a little modeling.

10:12.696 --> 10:15.197
Mostly for art classes
at the community college.

10:15.532 --> 10:16.991
That's how I met Buddy.

10:17.075 --> 10:19.243
Really. Was he an artist?

10:19.619 --> 10:21.453
Nah. They caught
him peeking in
through the windows.

10:21.621 --> 10:22.871
(CHUCKLES)

10:23.498 --> 10:24.873
That...
That's such a sweet story.

10:25.292 --> 10:28.168
You know,
I just got so tired
of dating boys.

10:28.253 --> 10:29.628
No offense.
Mmm.

10:29.921 --> 10:31.922
Then one day
I met Buddy, and

10:32.382 --> 10:33.841
he just swept me
right off my feet.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.092
Oh.

10:35.218 --> 10:36.343
TIA: Oh, there you are.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.848
These are my babies,
Ashley and Emily.

10:41.516 --> 10:43.183
KELLY: Hi, girls.
BOTH: Hi.

10:43.268 --> 10:45.269
This is Madison,
and this is Carter.

10:45.353 --> 10:46.353
Hi.

10:46.438 --> 10:49.732
You know,
you girls will probably be
in a lot of the same classes.

10:49.983 --> 10:52.234
Great.
Are there any hot guys?

10:52.360 --> 10:53.360
Uh...

10:53.570 --> 10:56.488
Yeah, but, you know,
they're all enormous tools.

10:56.573 --> 10:58.157
Really?
Will you introduce us?

10:58.241 --> 10:59.992
Oh!
Kelly, thank you.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.410
That has been in
my family for years.

11:01.536 --> 11:02.786
Oh, it's beautiful.

11:02.871 --> 11:03.829
It ought to be.

11:03.913 --> 11:05.622
It's worth more
than this entire house
put together.

11:05.832 --> 11:06.832
(CHUCKLES)

11:07.083 --> 11:08.167
Let me just find
a safe place for it,

11:08.251 --> 11:09.626
and we'll see about
getting these kids to school.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.504
I can drop them
at school if you want
to stay and unpack.

11:12.589 --> 11:13.630
Really?

11:13.715 --> 11:15.299
Sure.
You'd do that for me?

11:15.383 --> 11:16.842
Yeah. No problem.
I'll just...

11:16.926 --> 11:18.969
I'll bring the car around
while they get dressed.

11:19.054 --> 11:20.304
Oh, they are dressed.
Trust me.

11:20.388 --> 11:21.930
This is more clothes
than they've worn
in months.

11:23.058 --> 11:24.433
Can I live here?

11:24.559 --> 11:25.934
Get in the car.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.355
You got
a fake I. D?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.023
Uh. No. No.

11:31.107 --> 11:32.232
Don't worry.
We can make you one.

11:32.359 --> 11:33.484
Nice girls.

11:33.568 --> 11:35.361
You kidding me?
I pray every day
for the strength

11:35.445 --> 11:38.197
not to run over
the both of them
with a truck.

11:38.281 --> 11:39.281
Have a nice day!

11:39.616 --> 11:41.950
MAN: All right.
Listen up, you guys.
We just got in

11:42.202 --> 11:44.078
a new shipment
of Aspens.

11:44.496 --> 11:47.456
And I want you to
sell three for me
by lunchtime. All right.

11:47.999 --> 11:49.041
What, are you kidding?

11:49.125 --> 11:51.293
Hey. We got
a new salesman.
Buddy Hall over here.

11:51.378 --> 11:52.419
Let's make him
feel welcome.

11:52.504 --> 11:53.587
Come on. Yeah.
How you doin'?

11:53.671 --> 11:54.963
All right.
All right. All right.

11:55.090 --> 11:56.382
Hi.

11:57.550 --> 11:58.884
Welcome aboard.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.677
Sell, sell, sell.
All right.

12:02.764 --> 12:03.972
(SOFTLY) Okay.

12:04.391 --> 12:06.475
(WHISPERING) Oh, this
is gonna be good. Oh!

12:06.559 --> 12:07.559
Oh.
Buddy!

12:07.644 --> 12:08.644
Hey. You, uh...

12:08.728 --> 12:10.729
Gee, you ready
to sell some cars?

12:10.814 --> 12:13.107
Me? I'm a born
car salesman.

12:13.191 --> 12:14.733
But I was
thinking today that

12:14.818 --> 12:17.194
maybe I would just
kind of ease into it.

12:17.278 --> 12:18.946
You know,
get a feeling for the place.

12:19.030 --> 12:21.990
Yeah, well...
Well, you see that
tire-kicker right there?

12:22.575 --> 12:23.700
He's all yours.

12:23.868 --> 12:24.868
Hmm.

12:25.161 --> 12:26.328
I don't know. I...

12:26.413 --> 12:28.705
I got a thousand bucks
says you can't sell him.

12:28.790 --> 12:30.165
Let me in
on that action.

12:30.291 --> 12:31.792
You know...
Thousand bucks?

12:31.876 --> 12:33.085
...let's just
make it three.

12:33.169 --> 12:34.545
Three?
TED: Three g's.

12:37.424 --> 12:39.174
All right.
You guys are asking for it.

12:41.344 --> 12:43.637
There's one born
every minute. Come on.

12:45.181 --> 12:46.890
MAN: Ted, this is genius.

12:47.267 --> 12:49.852
You can't let
these new guys
get into a rhythm.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.396
I'm telling you, boys.
From this day forward,

12:53.857 --> 12:54.898
we own that guy.

12:55.358 --> 12:57.359
There we go.
The brush-off.

12:57.527 --> 12:59.361
That's the brush-off.
The brush-off. Okay.

13:05.535 --> 13:06.577
(ALL LAUGHING)

13:06.661 --> 13:07.661
We got ya!

13:07.745 --> 13:08.829
Are you okay?

13:08.872 --> 13:10.998
You walked face-first
into that buzz saw.
(IMITATES SAW)

13:11.916 --> 13:15.252
Money on my desk
by the end of the day.
No checks.

13:18.089 --> 13:19.423
That... That's
not possible.

13:19.507 --> 13:21.717
Mr. Murray
owns the dealership.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.475
I just bought
one of my own cars.

13:32.854 --> 13:36.064
And the worst part
is I paid sticker.

13:41.905 --> 13:42.946
Hey, girls.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.406
Hey, Dad.
Hi, Dad.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.508
Buddy, no!
Oh, my God!

14:02.592 --> 14:04.593
Told you things
were gonna work out.
Yeah, yes.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.386
Oh, baby.
I'm so proud of you.
It's great.

14:06.471 --> 14:08.347
Great, great,

14:14.479 --> 14:15.854
Buddy.
Yeah.

14:15.939 --> 14:17.439
Bud.
I know.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.150
Don't you even...
You always do this.

14:20.235 --> 14:22.402
You start out great.
You lose interest.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.989
And the next thing you know,
I'm up to my neck
in cardboard boxes.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.867
No, it's great.
I'm a car salesman.

14:28.952 --> 14:30.577
Hey. That's a good job.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.287
It's a great job.
Great job.

Yes.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.798
It's all the same.

14:43.258 --> 14:45.592
I don't know.
I was just hoping that,

14:45.677 --> 14:48.428
you know, one day
I'd do something big.

14:49.389 --> 14:51.139
Something important.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.559
Something monumental.

14:53.935 --> 14:56.436
You are.
You're going to pay off
our monumental debt.

(GRUMBLES)

14:58.731 --> 15:00.315
Buddy, you promised me.

15:00.817 --> 15:04.069
Oh. Well, I will
keep my promise.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.320
That was a little...

15:05.446 --> 15:06.572
Everything's
gonna be great.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.699
Oh, yes.

What do you
got goin' here?

15:22.380 --> 15:23.714
It's My Earth.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.257
My Earth?
You type in an address,

15:25.341 --> 15:28.427
and you can see
every house in the
country from space.

15:28.511 --> 15:29.928
Really?
Mm-hmm.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.181
Emily's already used
it to track the, like,
five hottest guys in school.

15:33.266 --> 15:35.392
Yeah, Dad.
Three of them live
two blocks from here.

15:35.476 --> 15:38.145
Wow. That's more math
than you've done in years.

15:38.229 --> 15:39.896
Did it hurt?
Loser.

15:40.648 --> 15:42.858
Easy. You can see
every house from space?

15:42.942 --> 15:44.568
Yeah.
Let's see.

15:52.201 --> 15:53.660
Where's our house?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.287
Oh, you can't
see our house.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.830
EMILY: But you can
see the neighbors'.

15:57.457 --> 15:58.790

We're invisible.

Hmm.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.381
Space, huh?

16:16.726 --> 16:19.227
Of course you can see
the big house.

16:44.087 --> 16:46.213
See it from space.

16:48.758 --> 16:50.425
I'll light it up.

Buddy.

17:25.670 --> 17:27.462
Buddy.
Hey, Steve.

17:28.214 --> 17:30.132
Do you have any idea
what time it is?

17:30.216 --> 17:32.509
What's the matter?
All the clocks in
your house busted?

17:32.593 --> 17:34.678
No, I know
what time it is.

17:35.096 --> 17:36.596
Oh. What, did ya

17:36.681 --> 17:39.099
just need an excuse
to come over here
in your underwear?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.059
No. No.
I was being sarcastic.

17:41.811 --> 17:43.979
Oh. Well,
you gotta know that stuff

17:44.147 --> 17:46.314
like that just goes
right over my head.

17:46.399 --> 17:47.441
Here. Hold these things.

17:47.525 --> 17:48.567
I want to strand them out.

17:48.693 --> 17:49.735
No. I will not
hold on to this.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.280
That's why I came over
here. You're making
all kinds of noise.

17:53.364 --> 17:55.866
Do you have any idea
how bright your house is?

17:55.950 --> 17:58.160
Yeah. It's pretty
damn bright.

17:59.162 --> 18:00.954
BUDDY: Look at that. Whoo!

18:02.206 --> 18:05.459
Oh. Is that what's
bothering you? The lights?

18:05.793 --> 18:07.627
Yes. That's right.
Oh, I'm sorry.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.963
I didn't mean it.
I'll turn them off.
Thank you.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.673
Oh.
Thank you.

18:11.758 --> 18:12.799
Steve.

18:14.802 --> 18:16.178
Are we gonna be friends?

18:16.262 --> 18:19.473
Because,
you know, we just moved
into the neighborhood, and

18:20.016 --> 18:23.560
boy, it would be bad
if I ticked off
the only guy I know.

18:24.437 --> 18:26.188
That would kill me.

18:26.272 --> 18:29.107
Well, maybe I overreacted
a little bit.

18:30.151 --> 18:32.736
Ah, you know, I can be
a real jerk sometimes.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.822
Maybe we should just
start completely over.

18:38.701 --> 18:39.868
Buddy Hall. And you are?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.120
No. I didn't mean
we should literally.

18:42.205 --> 18:45.081
I was...
I was speaking metaphorically.

18:46.209 --> 18:47.209
Pew!

18:48.044 --> 18:49.294
That's it. I don't...

18:49.378 --> 18:52.506
Sometimes
my stupidity astounds me.

18:54.842 --> 18:57.719
I got an idea.
How about if you and I

18:57.804 --> 18:59.846
come up with
a series of hand signals,

18:59.931 --> 19:02.098
so I'll know when
you're gonna talk weird?

19:04.852 --> 19:05.894
I'll see you tomorrow.

19:10.024 --> 19:11.775
This is gonna be good.
Come on.
It's so late.

19:11.859 --> 19:14.444
Get that satellite
image up that you
had before.

19:14.529 --> 19:16.613
Go on. Here.
Honey, you sit here.
Really?

19:16.697 --> 19:18.782
Yeah. Sit right
there and watch. Yeah.

19:18.866 --> 19:20.867
There's so many buttons.
I'll do it. Move.

19:20.952 --> 19:23.787
Do it. Do it.
Okay. You do it.
Where you going?

19:23.871 --> 19:25.872
Stick around.
I want you to see this.

19:26.249 --> 19:27.207
You still can't see it.

19:27.291 --> 19:28.291
You're gonna miss it.

19:28.376 --> 19:30.043
Sorry, Daddy.
What do you mean
you can't see it?

19:30.127 --> 19:32.921
It's impossible.
I put so many
more lights on.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.298
Oh, honey,
you're gonna get it.
You'll get it.

more of these?

19:54.527 --> 19:55.694

19:55.778 --> 19:56.778

19:59.448 --> 20:02.158

You're gonna love this.

20:05.746 --> 20:08.999
It's a horse-drawn sleigh.

20:09.083 --> 20:10.876
Don't see many of
these around anymore.

20:10.960 --> 20:12.043
No, you don't.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.253
Nice.

20:15.798 --> 20:16.798
I'll take it!

20:17.925 --> 20:19.301
No.
Come on.

20:19.385 --> 20:20.427
No.
Why?

20:20.511 --> 20:22.220
Get away from me with that.
What do you mean?

20:22.305 --> 20:23.972
I'm serious.
I'll call Child Services.

20:24.098 --> 20:25.765
One look at that,
and they will put you away.

20:26.434 --> 20:27.976
Maddy. Maddy. We...

20:28.060 --> 20:31.021
We always wear
matching sweaters
for the family Christmas card.

20:31.105 --> 20:34.774
Come on.
It's all right. Huh? Please?

20:35.318 --> 20:37.152
Hmm? Look, huh?

20:39.822 --> 20:40.989
Please.

20:41.657 --> 20:43.033
Are we ready?

20:43.159 --> 20:44.576
There. You see?
Mom's wearing hers.

20:45.036 --> 20:47.120
Okay.
Mom's old and married.

20:47.204 --> 20:48.622
All right? She doesn't
need the self-esteem.

20:48.748 --> 20:50.165
I still have
something to live for.

20:50.499 --> 20:52.667
It's true.
Madison's right.

20:53.377 --> 20:55.170
She's got her whole life
ahead of her.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.006
That's more than I can say
for some of us.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.300
Come on.
He does this every year.

21:00.384 --> 21:02.427
He starts acting
all depressed so people
feel bad for him

21:02.511 --> 21:03.845
and buy him
bigger presents.

21:04.347 --> 21:06.097
Hey. The new
neighbors have reindeer.

21:06.724 --> 21:08.058
TOGETHER: Reindeer?

21:08.184 --> 21:09.559
Wait. Wait. Wait.

21:11.354 --> 21:13.605
BUDDY: Hey, Steve.
What do you think?

21:13.856 --> 21:15.690
Oh, my God.
(CHUCKLES)

21:15.775 --> 21:18.902
It's so cute.
Where in the world
did you find it?

21:18.986 --> 21:21.780
Eugene Young down
at the hardware store
sold it to him.

21:21.864 --> 21:22.906
Isn't it beautiful?

21:23.032 --> 21:24.115
Beautiful.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.242
Yes. And...
And these horses.

21:26.327 --> 21:29.204
These horses... I...
I especially like the way

21:29.288 --> 21:31.289
you've duct-taped
the antlers to their heads.

21:31.374 --> 21:35.460
Yeah, well,
apparently, reindeer are not
indigenous to the region.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.295
ASHLEY:
That sweater is really cool.

21:37.380 --> 21:38.630
Yeah.
Is it Marc Jacobs?

21:38.756 --> 21:40.006
Oh.

21:40.466 --> 21:41.925

the yard, a skeleton or two,

32:37.873 --> 32:39.332

and scare people.

32:39.374 --> 32:41.334
It'll be great.
What do you think?
I don't think so.

Our annual
Christmas carnival.

prestigious position.

Speed skating?
We do it right here.

They put the ice
right on Main Street.

speed skating myself.

Well, thank you, Wallace.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

33:18.372 --> 33:19.413
So, anyway,

33:20.457 --> 33:22.708
how do you feel
about the liberal
use of mistletoe?

33:23.251 --> 33:28.005
Well, I feel that
you should go sparingly
around the threshold,

33:28.090 --> 33:29.674
because that's a clichÃ©.

33:30.092 --> 33:31.967
Please. Please.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.678
My mission is clear.

33:33.762 --> 33:35.554

to do that for years.

34:10.465 --> 34:11.757

34:11.842 --> 34:16.846
It should be a cookbook

41:47.505 --> 41:49.173
Yeah, it is.

It's the stupidest
thing I've ever heard.

to be seen from space.

all down tomorrow.

what I mean.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.152
You just said
they look stupid.

42:10.278 --> 42:11.403

But all good ideas
are crazy.

These are lights.

it means more to
you than just lights.

Might turn out to be

42:32.967 --> 42:34.760
something monumental.

on you, can't I?

42:53.780 --> 42:56.031
He's bringing in animals
for a live manger scene.

make sure they see it,

bring 'em tonight.

if finishing those lights

that's the bill
to the new car you bought.

52:55.172 --> 52:57.674
I didn't buy a car.
You gave me a car.

52:57.758 --> 52:59.300

52:59.426 --> 53:01.010
Tr... The tree?

53:01.220 --> 53:03.012
I don't know
about any tree.

53:03.097 --> 53:07.016
And unless they have
film on it, you don't
know about any tree.

53:07.101 --> 53:08.434

film on it, do they?

53:08.602 --> 53:09.936

No, no, no, no, no.

53:11.939 --> 53:13.189

in my living room.

that that car was a present.

looked at the bill,

by almost a third,

is quite a substantial gift.

your signature.

have let me drive
the car outta here.

just be quiet

He's back up.
He's on his feet,
and he's skating fast,

01:00:07.688 --> 01:00:09.313

of ice to catch up.

Gustave and Gerta

his move now or else.

almost taking out
Buddy in the process!

Well...
Well, you know what it is.

01:13:36.162 --> 01:13:39.748
I was seven years old.
My dad and I moved to Alabama,

01:13:39.832 --> 01:13:43.043
and on Christmas morning
we woke up and sat
on the kitchen floor,

01:13:43.127 --> 01:13:44.920
ate french fries
and drank chocolate milk.

01:13:45.004 --> 01:13:48.965

Exactly. It wasn't planned.
It wasn't organized.

into their BlackBerry.

more than ever. No.

more than ever is you.

Christmas shopping with you.

01:14:06.484 --> 01:14:08.360

that tree with you.

01:14:08.444 --> 01:14:10.195
And Madison... Well,

01:14:10.279 --> 01:14:12.656
Madison's a teenage girl,
so she just pretty
much ignored you.

01:14:12.740 --> 01:14:15.117
But if you'd been
paying attention,

01:14:15.201 --> 01:14:16.868
you would have seen that
she just wants you to know

01:14:16.953 --> 01:14:18.453
that she's not
a little girl anymore.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:20.914

that's a message
I got pretty clear.

you weren't even
home last night?

went and stayed in a motel.

to talk to me.

left it out here
last night.

my power.

cord. It goes both ways.

Hey, Mom, look!

01:18:56.857 --> 01:18:58.775
Carter, get back here.

01:18:59.151 --> 01:19:02.112
I'll get him.
Carter, get back here,
you little fart.

01:19:08.994 --> 01:19:12.038
Mom, you won't believe this.
You guys have to come.

01:19:12.581 --> 01:19:14.207
Carter!

01:19:14.333 --> 01:19:16.000

Let's see where it goes!

It's real cool!

it keeps going!

This is amazing.

01:20:11.765 --> 01:20:13.266
Mom,
all these lights...

01:20:13.392 --> 01:20:14.893
Were Dad's lights.

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.937
STEVE: I begged you
to let me do the yams.

01:20:18.022 --> 01:20:20.982
BUDDY: I could tell
right away you had no
feeling for starches.

01:20:21.066 --> 01:20:22.400
Your three-bean
salad is very bad.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:23.860
What did you expect
me to do,

01:20:23.944 --> 01:20:26.654
the three-bean salad
and the fiesta corn?

01:20:29.366 --> 01:20:31.826
We thought maybe
you'd be hungry.

01:20:33.078 --> 01:20:34.579
Tia, look.
You thought some lights

01:20:34.663 --> 01:20:37.874
and a TV dinner would
make up for all
the crap that I have...

01:20:44.131 --> 01:20:45.340
Is that what I think it is?

01:20:45.466 --> 01:20:46.674
We didn't have
time to do a turkey.

01:20:47.384 --> 01:20:50.428
So we made a few things
from your new cookbook.

01:20:56.644 --> 01:21:00.480
I got you this little
pre-Christmas gift.

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:14.619
I missed you
so much. Oh.

01:21:15.788 --> 01:21:19.541
Oh, gosh.
How did you afford it?
How did you ever afford it?

01:21:19.625 --> 01:21:21.876
Well, let's just say
we're not gonna use

01:21:22.002 --> 01:21:24.295
our credit cards for
the rest of our lives.

01:21:28.634 --> 01:21:30.343
You've been busy.

01:21:30.427 --> 01:21:33.638
Kelly, I'm so sorry.
It's just everything got so...

01:21:34.473 --> 01:21:36.391
You go along thinking
you're doing all
the right things

01:21:36.475 --> 01:21:38.643
for all the right
reasons, and then,

01:21:39.144 --> 01:21:41.312
one day you blow up
your house.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:43.690
And it occurs to
you that somewhere
along the way,

01:21:44.358 --> 01:21:45.692
things got out of hand.

01:21:47.194 --> 01:21:49.404
It just seemed
like your whole life
had gotten so loud,

01:21:49.488 --> 01:21:52.490
that the only thing you were
gonna hear was an empty house.

01:21:52.992 --> 01:21:54.492
You're right.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:58.037
You were right.
And you were right to leave.

01:21:59.123 --> 01:22:00.248
You were. I understand.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:04.168
You all were.
You were all right to leave.
And I'm so glad you're back.

01:22:10.301 --> 01:22:11.384
So I can date now?

01:22:11.885 --> 01:22:13.970
Sailors during wartime? No.

01:22:14.847 --> 01:22:19.517
But you are growing up,
so, I guess I have
to get used to that.

01:22:21.395 --> 01:22:23.646
Mr. Hall, you took down
all your lights.

01:22:23.731 --> 01:22:25.356
Yeah. I thought
it would be better.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.066
Gee, I bet it would
have worked.

01:22:27.151 --> 01:22:28.776
Yeah, it might have.
I bet they could have

01:22:28.861 --> 01:22:29.986
seen our house from space.

01:22:30.696 --> 01:22:32.155
We'll never know.

Look. I...
I'm sorry. Um...

01:22:56.347 --> 01:22:57.847
You all have to go home.

01:22:59.224 --> 01:23:00.850
There are no lights tonight.

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:03.436
Nope, but there will be!

01:23:04.021 --> 01:23:05.063
Buddy, what's happening?

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.272
I don't know.

01:23:06.357 --> 01:23:08.399
I told them Buddy
was a little short on lights

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:10.777
and maybe they'd like to come
and help out.

01:23:10.861 --> 01:23:12.737
How many people
did you call?

01:23:13.322 --> 01:23:16.491
You have no idea
how bad the eyesight
is in this town.

01:23:16.575 --> 01:23:20.662
MTV is sending someone
down to do a story
on Buddy's lights.

01:23:20.746 --> 01:23:22.497
They don't know
he took 'em down.

01:23:22.581 --> 01:23:24.290
Which is why we better
put 'em back up.

01:23:25.084 --> 01:23:26.626
Well,
you just gonna stand there,

01:23:26.752 --> 01:23:28.336
or are you gonna
help me do this thing?

Thank you so much.

01:23:57.574 --> 01:24:00.368
And keep those
truck lights on too.
Those are good too.

That's really nice of you.

doing an excellent job.

where apparently
the whole town

01:24:18.137 --> 01:24:19.762
has come out to
see if Buddy Hall,

a local car salesman,
can achieve the impossible.

01:24:23.267 --> 01:24:25.643

display in his front yard

be seen from space.

this situation live.

for spending your
holiday plans with us.

with a tin of biscuits,

finally arrived.

like this town.

maybe you could ask
for your job back
