00:19.410 --> 00:21.180
Placing beam-out marker.

00:21.350 --> 00:24.420
Return transport,
14 minutes, 40 seconds.

00:25.420 --> 00:27.420
Is your view any better, Geordi?

00:27.590 --> 00:31.260
Not too bad. A lot
of charged-particle precipitation.

00:31.430 --> 00:34.930
- I can compensate.
- Communicators are dysfunctional.

00:35.100 --> 00:36.560
Tricorders?

00:36.730 --> 00:39.130
Readings only valid
within five metres.

00:39.300 --> 00:43.740
Good thing we didn't bring Data.
We'd be unscrambling his circuits.

00:45.740 --> 00:47.310
Commander!

00:47.810 --> 00:50.480
Picking up something
on the positron scan.

00:57.750 --> 01:01.660
Over here!
Some electrically conductive objects.

01:12.530 --> 01:15.140
Recognise those markings, Worf?

01:15.300 --> 01:17.470
Yes, sir. Romulan.

01:18.710 --> 01:22.540
What the hell are they doing
in a Federation sector?

01:22.710 --> 01:26.050
Picking up
traces of ultritium residue.

01:26.210 --> 01:29.680
An explosive device
must have destroyed the craft

01:29.850 --> 01:31.550
after it crashed.

01:32.390 --> 01:34.990
Let's spread out. 25-metre radius.

01:35.160 --> 01:38.230
Our window back closes in 1 2 minutes.

01:57.710 --> 01:59.280
Commander!

02:11.930 --> 02:13.360
Cmdr Riker!

02:57.140 --> 02:59.740
- Four minutes to beam-up.
- Where is he?

02:59.910 --> 03:01.640
Wait here.

03:41.320 --> 03:42.980
Worf!

03:46.720 --> 03:48.720
Cmdr Riker!

03:54.660 --> 03:56.260
Geordi!

04:10.140 --> 04:13.650
Worf! Cmdr Riker!

04:21.320 --> 04:23.290
Hold your position, Mr Worf.

04:31.630 --> 04:33.200
Worf!

05:03.460 --> 05:06.400
Space, the final frontier.

05:08.140 --> 05:11.540
These are the voyages
of the Starship Enterprise.

05:12.070 --> 05:16.580
Its continuing mission,
to explore strange new worlds...

05:17.740 --> 05:21.050
...to seek out new life
and new civilisations...

05:22.380 --> 05:25.920
...to boldly go
where no one has gone before.

06:26.280 --> 06:30.220
Captain's log, stardate 43349.2.

06:30.380 --> 06:35.360
An unidentified distress signal has
uncovered a crashed Romulan vessel

06:35.520 --> 06:38.890
on the surface of Galorndon Core,
a Federation planet.

06:39.060 --> 06:41.260
They have recovered one survivor.

06:41.430 --> 06:45.630
But Lt Cmdr La Forge did not
report back with the away team

06:45.800 --> 06:47.800
and is still missing.

06:48.640 --> 06:53.270
- Get him to sickbay.
- Post a guard at all times.

06:53.440 --> 06:56.110
He's not going anywhere, Lieutenant.

06:57.880 --> 07:00.410
Sorry. There's no way to lock in.

07:00.580 --> 07:02.720
Keep trying, O'Brien.

07:03.750 --> 07:06.490
The storm's creating
thousands of ghosts.

07:06.650 --> 07:09.360
Beam those ghosts back!
One may be Geordi.

07:09.490 --> 07:12.530
- Permission to lead another team.
- Denied.

07:12.690 --> 07:16.000
When we get a window
in the storms. The crash site?

07:16.160 --> 07:17.870
The Romulan craft is a loss.

07:18.030 --> 07:21.370
There's nothing to salvage
unless you use tweezers.

07:21.540 --> 07:22.870
No others?

07:23.040 --> 07:26.240
You couldn't see
two metres in front of yourself.

07:26.410 --> 07:31.080
It is the last place one would expect
Romulan encroachment.

07:31.250 --> 07:33.350
On the other hand,

07:33.510 --> 07:36.250
Galorndon Core
would provide ideal cover

07:36.420 --> 07:39.090
for the opening move
of a new offensive.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.360
I doubt they were there
for the climate.

09:08.180 --> 09:11.040
We thought it would
be like working on Vulcans.

09:11.210 --> 09:13.810
But there are subtle differences.
Too many.

09:13.980 --> 09:17.420
- Can you treat him?
- He has damage to vital areas.

09:17.580 --> 09:21.760
He needs a transfusion
of compatible ribosomes to recover.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.890
I'm setting up a schedule
to test the crew.

09:25.060 --> 09:28.560
- We can't use the replicator?
- It's too complex.

09:28.730 --> 09:32.370
- Will he survive?
- I can't answer that yet.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.070
Will he survive long enough
to tell us what he was doing?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.370
It's an important consideration.

09:39.410 --> 09:41.910
I can bring him around
for a few minutes.

09:42.080 --> 09:44.550
But there is
one serious complication.

09:46.150 --> 09:50.320
His brainwaves indicate
early neural-pathway degeneration.

09:50.480 --> 09:53.650
- Head injury?
- No obvious cranial trauma.

09:53.790 --> 09:56.960
I'm guessing
the magnetic fields on the surface

09:57.120 --> 10:00.130
slowly broke down
his synaptic connections.

10:00.290 --> 10:02.260
Will that affect Geordi?

10:11.410 --> 10:13.640
He'll be conscious for a minute.

10:18.980 --> 10:22.620
You are on board
the Federation Starship Enterprise.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.450
We're treating your injuries.

10:26.690 --> 10:29.490
How long were you
down on Galorndon Core?

10:31.960 --> 10:33.530
Do you understand me?

10:34.190 --> 10:37.630
I... will not answer questions.

10:37.730 --> 10:41.000
We need to know
if there are other survivors.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.510
I am alone.

10:45.040 --> 10:47.780
I will not answer any questions.

10:48.680 --> 10:51.910
Do you have a mothership
to advise of your condition?

11:02.020 --> 11:05.090
The only answer he gives
is that he was alone.

11:05.260 --> 11:07.260
Which suggests that he wasn't.

11:56.980 --> 12:00.350
Something, anything,
to cut through the storm.

12:00.510 --> 12:03.580
Some way to get a signal
through to him.

12:04.420 --> 12:08.360
A neutrino pulse! We could build
a portable neutrino source

12:08.520 --> 12:11.490
and send it to the surface
as a beacon.

12:12.090 --> 12:16.000
A neutrino pulse would send
particles up through the atmosphere

12:16.160 --> 12:18.200
and be detected by Geordi's visor.

12:18.370 --> 12:20.830
He can show himself
by modifying the pulse.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.070
Make it so.

12:24.710 --> 12:25.940
Captain.

12:26.110 --> 12:29.540
I have a new transmission
on a parallel frequency.

12:29.710 --> 12:33.880
- From the surface?
- No, from inside the Romulan zone.

12:34.050 --> 12:36.850
We should be able
to view the transmission.

12:37.020 --> 12:38.520
On screen.

12:39.350 --> 12:41.120
Tomalak to Pi.

12:42.460 --> 12:45.730
We have received
your distress signal. Respond.

12:47.590 --> 12:49.460
If you can hear me,

12:49.630 --> 12:52.970
we are entering
the Neutral Zone now.

12:53.130 --> 12:55.940
We will reach you in six hours.

13:06.950 --> 13:09.520
Mr Worf, hail the Romulan vessel.

13:11.420 --> 13:13.490
Hailing frequencies open, sir.

13:13.650 --> 13:16.960
Romulan vessel,
this is Capt Jean-Luc Picard

13:17.120 --> 13:19.790
of the Federation
Starship Enterprise.

13:24.330 --> 13:26.300
The frequency is open, sir.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.870
Cmdr Tomalak, we have
intercepted your transmission.

13:31.040 --> 13:34.510
You are not
to enter Federation space.

13:35.340 --> 13:38.380
Capt Picard, my apologies.

13:38.910 --> 13:40.750
Had I known you were near,

13:40.910 --> 13:44.820
I would have advised you
before crossing the Neutral Zone.

13:44.990 --> 13:45.920
Indeed?

13:46.090 --> 13:48.760
I am sure you will understand.

13:48.890 --> 13:51.490
One of our ships
had a navigational error

13:51.660 --> 13:54.190
and crashed on Galorndon Core.

13:54.360 --> 13:56.500
A slight navigational error?

13:56.660 --> 13:59.700
Nearly half a light year
past the Neutral Zone?

13:59.870 --> 14:03.770
I assure you,
no aggression was intended.

14:04.610 --> 14:06.010
Commander.

14:06.570 --> 14:09.240
We have recovered
one of your survivors.

14:10.540 --> 14:12.680
He is on board your ship?

14:12.850 --> 14:15.580
He is being treated
for severe injuries.

14:16.720 --> 14:18.290
And his craft?

14:18.820 --> 14:22.620
Destroyed... deliberately.
After the crash.

14:23.490 --> 14:27.800
I'm sure you are prepared
to rendezvous in the Neutral Zone.

14:28.260 --> 14:32.570
I have a team on the planet.
We have to beam them up.

14:32.730 --> 14:35.300
And then you will return my officer?

14:37.340 --> 14:41.610
Are there any other Romulans
to recover from Galorndon Core?

14:43.110 --> 14:45.980
No. It was a one-man craft.

14:47.480 --> 14:48.650
Captain.

14:48.820 --> 14:52.650
We will be at the Federation border
in roughly five hours.

14:52.820 --> 14:55.890
We will expect you to rendezvous
at that time.

14:58.790 --> 15:00.130
Counsellor?

15:00.290 --> 15:03.060
There is great hostility
behind his smile.

15:03.230 --> 15:06.000
He'll stop at nothing
to complete his mission.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.170
Including the Neutral Zone border.

15:08.340 --> 15:12.010
Captain, I see no reason
to return the Romulan.

15:12.170 --> 15:14.310
He should be held and interrogated.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.880
We have every right to detain him.

15:17.040 --> 15:20.710
Without evidence of intent,
it will not be simple.

15:20.880 --> 15:24.850
It obviously wasn't pilot's error.
It demands a response.

15:25.020 --> 15:27.920
But we must measure
our response carefully,

15:28.090 --> 15:30.790
or history may remember
Galorndon Core

15:30.960 --> 15:35.760
along with Pearl Harbor
and Station Salem One

15:35.930 --> 15:39.630
as the stage
for a bloody preamble to war.

15:49.440 --> 15:52.980
I want him off the drugs.
They're not doing anything.

15:53.150 --> 15:55.550
- Dr Crusher to Picard.
- Go ahead.

15:55.720 --> 15:58.590
My patient is not responding
to treatment.

15:58.750 --> 16:01.420
You haven't found
a compatible ribosome donor?

16:01.560 --> 16:03.920
The lab is still processing
the tests.

16:04.090 --> 16:05.630
Early results indicate

16:05.790 --> 16:08.330
humans have many
bio-rejection factors.

16:08.500 --> 16:10.460
I've also ruled out the Vulcans.

16:10.960 --> 16:13.800
I think
I'll try old-fashioned medicine.

16:13.970 --> 16:17.270
Keep the fever down
and let the body heal itself.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.510
Keep me advised. Picard out.

16:19.670 --> 16:23.110
The neutrino beacon
is aboard a class-3 probe.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.180
Well done, Ensign.
Mr Worf, launch the probe.

16:26.350 --> 16:27.820
Aye aye, sir.

17:17.599 --> 17:20.099
Probe has reached the surface, sir.

17:20.700 --> 17:22.640
The neutrino stream is strong.

17:22.800 --> 17:26.210
Sensors are tracking the probe
despite the interference.

17:48.530 --> 17:51.230
A stationary neutrino source!

17:52.500 --> 17:56.500
Wesley Crusher. Thank you, Wesley!

18:36.940 --> 18:40.780
- You are my prisoner!
- Right.

18:40.950 --> 18:42.550
Congratulations.

18:42.680 --> 18:46.050
Surely a strategic triumph
for the Romulan Empire.

18:46.220 --> 18:47.790
Stay there!

18:49.590 --> 18:51.760
My shoes are full of sand.

18:51.930 --> 18:53.690
I hate that. Don't you?

18:53.860 --> 18:55.560
Name and rank.

18:56.760 --> 19:02.070
Lt Cmdr Geordi La Forge.
I don't think I got yours.

19:02.240 --> 19:04.740
A Romulan ship will arrive shortly.

19:04.840 --> 19:08.210
- You will accompany me on board.
- I don't think so.

19:08.380 --> 19:13.380
We heard your message, too,
and well, the fleet's in.

19:13.510 --> 19:15.720
The sky's full of Federation ships.

19:16.980 --> 19:21.190
- You're lying.
- I never lie with sand in my shoes.

19:22.220 --> 19:23.820
Get up!

19:26.130 --> 19:32.230
Seriously, the only way out of here
is for you to put that thing down.

19:32.400 --> 19:34.900
When there's a window in the storm...

20:07.530 --> 20:09.400
Are you OK?

20:23.120 --> 20:26.390
- You gotta be kidding.
- Sit!

20:33.490 --> 20:36.130
Welcome to Galorndon Core,

20:36.300 --> 20:39.930
where no good deed goes unpunished.

20:49.610 --> 20:51.180
Yes, Doctor?

20:52.180 --> 20:55.650
Lieutenant, good.
Come in. Please sit down.

21:02.360 --> 21:06.160
We have found a compatible
ribosome match for the Romulan.

21:06.330 --> 21:07.560
But only one.

21:07.730 --> 21:09.160
You.

21:10.300 --> 21:12.670
That is impossible. I am a Klingon.

21:13.170 --> 21:14.840
Different species, yes.

21:15.000 --> 21:17.970
But many humanoids have
comparable cell structures.

21:18.140 --> 21:21.380
And you have what this Romulan needs.

21:21.540 --> 21:24.580
There's absolutely no risk to you.

21:27.920 --> 21:30.880
You understood
that was the purpose of the testing?

21:31.390 --> 21:34.050
I have no objection to tests.

21:38.430 --> 21:41.100
You have an objection
to being a donor?

21:41.930 --> 21:43.100
Yes.

21:46.100 --> 21:49.900
I understand your feelings
about the Romulans,

21:50.040 --> 21:52.110
but this is not the time.

21:52.270 --> 21:56.640
If you had seen them kill
your parents, you would understand

21:56.780 --> 21:59.750
it is always the time
for those feelings.

21:59.910 --> 22:03.480
This Romulan
didn't murder your parents.

22:03.680 --> 22:06.920
And you are the only one
who can save his life.

22:10.320 --> 22:12.130
Then he will die.

22:18.970 --> 22:21.470
I sure wish you'd put that away.

22:21.600 --> 22:24.200
- You're afraid of dying!
- You bet.

22:24.370 --> 22:26.440
- Who isn't?
- I'm not.

22:26.540 --> 22:29.640
- Right!
- To die serving my people...

22:29.810 --> 22:31.810
The Romulan path to glory.

22:32.780 --> 22:34.650
You can be sarcastic now.

22:34.820 --> 22:38.020
But in a few millennia,
when humans are extinct

22:38.190 --> 22:40.890
and the Romulan Empire
spans the galaxy...

22:41.050 --> 22:44.420
You really believe that stuff,
don't you, Commodore?

22:45.690 --> 22:49.200
You may address me
as Centurion Bochra.

22:50.100 --> 22:51.930
Bochra?

22:52.570 --> 22:55.700
Good, solid Romulan name.

22:59.870 --> 23:01.780
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

23:01.940 --> 23:04.710
Wrong. Your heart rate
just shot way up.

23:10.750 --> 23:15.220
It translates radiation into
neural impulses. It allows me to see.

23:17.560 --> 23:19.390
Without it, you're blind?

23:20.860 --> 23:22.430
Yeah.

23:24.230 --> 23:28.140
- How did this happen?
- I was born that way.

23:29.040 --> 23:31.110
And your parents let you live?

23:31.270 --> 23:34.910
What kind of question is that?
Of course they did!

23:35.610 --> 23:37.640
No wonder your race is weak.

23:37.810 --> 23:41.250
You waste time and resources
on defective children.

23:44.850 --> 23:46.350
Whoa!

23:52.330 --> 23:55.960
I must be having some sort of...
polarity shift.

23:59.800 --> 24:02.470
Diagnostic insists everything's fine.

24:10.340 --> 24:13.910
Your body temperature's
gone up almost another point.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.880
- What are you saying?
- I don't know.

24:17.050 --> 24:20.920
It must be this place,
all that electromagnetic soup.

24:21.090 --> 24:23.820
It's wreaking havoc
on our nervous systems.

24:23.990 --> 24:28.100
Your metabolism's messed up,
so's my interface with the visor.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.100
- We gotta get out.
- Sit down.

24:30.260 --> 24:32.770
- Bochra.
- Sit down!

24:48.250 --> 24:49.850
What is that?

24:51.850 --> 24:56.020
It's just background fluctuation.
He hasn't found it yet.

24:56.190 --> 24:58.990
Then he must be hurt. Or dead.

25:02.600 --> 25:05.370
When does our next window open up,
Data?

25:05.530 --> 25:08.340
There is no indication,
no way to predict.

25:08.500 --> 25:12.310
- Incoming Romulan transmission.
- They're early.

25:12.470 --> 25:16.510
The Romulan warbird should be
29 minutes from the Neutral Zone.

25:16.680 --> 25:20.380
Close enough, however,
to see that we are not there.

25:21.680 --> 25:23.280
On screen.

25:24.150 --> 25:27.390
Picard. I'm approaching
the Federation border.

25:27.550 --> 25:30.660
The Enterprise is not to be found.
Why?

25:30.820 --> 25:35.700
My away team is unable to leave
the surface because of the storms.

25:35.860 --> 25:37.460
And my officer?

25:38.670 --> 25:42.570
- He is alive.
- His life remains in jeopardy?

25:44.170 --> 25:45.240
Yes.

25:45.410 --> 25:47.340
And yet you will not permit me

25:47.510 --> 25:51.040
into your precious Federation space
to retrieve him?

25:51.510 --> 25:55.380
If the point is not clear,
let me make it again.

25:55.550 --> 25:58.590
Romulan warships
do not enter Federation space

25:58.750 --> 26:00.520
unless they are to do battle.

26:01.050 --> 26:03.160
But a mission of mercy?

26:03.320 --> 26:06.760
A mission to recover
one of your officers,

26:06.930 --> 26:10.400
who has been caught
on a Federation planet

26:10.560 --> 26:12.370
for reasons as yet unknown.

26:12.530 --> 26:16.440
- I have already explained.
- I rejected your explanation!

26:17.740 --> 26:19.310
Territories!

26:20.540 --> 26:24.040
You would measure territories

26:24.210 --> 26:26.380
against a man's life?

26:27.150 --> 26:30.750
I am singularly impressed
by your concern for a life.

26:30.920 --> 26:34.090
Do not risk more lives
by leaving the Neutral Zone!

26:34.250 --> 26:35.790
Picard out.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.500
Bochra.

26:47.530 --> 26:50.470
You're in bad shape.
My vision's worse.

26:50.640 --> 26:55.980
There's a beacon to get us to
my ship, but not if I can't find it.

26:56.110 --> 26:58.480
I cannot surrender to the Federation.

26:58.650 --> 27:00.550
Then stay here and die!

27:02.450 --> 27:04.790
If the situation were reversed...

27:05.990 --> 27:08.660
...would you not die to avoid capture?

27:09.160 --> 27:11.160
I don't know. I might.

27:12.130 --> 27:14.900
If I thought
the stakes were high enough.

27:15.060 --> 27:17.530
But they'd have to be pretty high.

27:20.500 --> 27:23.370
I guess I'd make a lousy Romulan!

27:25.410 --> 27:28.340
I no more wish to die than you do.

27:28.840 --> 27:30.240
Bochra.

27:31.410 --> 27:36.220
There are times when it's necessary
to die for one's ideals.

27:38.950 --> 27:41.460
Do you believe this is the time?

27:52.770 --> 27:55.440
Come on. Let's go find that beacon.

28:02.780 --> 28:04.510
Whoa!

28:04.680 --> 28:06.350
What is it?

28:06.980 --> 28:08.980
Everything's gone blank.

28:14.960 --> 28:16.520
I'm blind.

28:30.970 --> 28:32.510
Come.

28:33.910 --> 28:35.510
Worf.

28:42.050 --> 28:44.590
You are busy. Forgive my intrusion.

28:44.750 --> 28:48.420
For what it's worth,
I understand your bitterness.

28:48.590 --> 28:51.260
With respect, sir, you cannot.

28:53.890 --> 28:56.900
I am asked to give the blood
of my mother and father

28:57.060 --> 29:00.430
- To those who murdered them!
- You blame all Romulans?

29:00.600 --> 29:02.440
- Yes.
- For ever?

29:04.840 --> 29:08.180
What if the Federation made peace
with the Romulans?

29:09.610 --> 29:10.910
Impossible.

29:11.910 --> 29:15.680
That's what your people said
a few years ago about humans.

29:18.290 --> 29:21.090
Think how many died in that war.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.060
Would you and I be here now

29:24.220 --> 29:27.830
if we hadn't let go
of the anger and blame?

29:28.460 --> 29:30.300
Where does it end, Worf?

29:30.460 --> 29:32.730
If that Romulan dies,

29:33.430 --> 29:37.070
does his family carry the bitterness
on another generation?

29:42.310 --> 29:44.550
Then you believe I should?

29:44.710 --> 29:47.850
What I believe... doesn't matter.

29:49.380 --> 29:52.050
My Starfleet training
tells me one thing.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.890
But everything I am
tells me another.

29:56.060 --> 29:59.790
- Lt Worf to sickbay.
- Acknowledged.

30:22.220 --> 30:25.650
Lieutenant,
his life is coming to an end.

30:25.820 --> 30:29.320
I thought it important
for you to see him again.

30:29.490 --> 30:32.530
It's not too late
to change your mind.

30:47.340 --> 30:49.240
Come close to me, Klingon.

30:51.210 --> 30:54.110
Let me die
with my hands at your throat.

30:55.080 --> 30:59.490
There is a substance within
my cells which you need to survive.

31:02.920 --> 31:06.490
Then you've come
to hear me beg for my life?

31:07.590 --> 31:09.100
No.

31:15.540 --> 31:17.700
I would rather die

31:17.870 --> 31:22.280
than pollute my body
with Klingon filth!

31:36.220 --> 31:39.290
I've lost
almost all feeling in my legs.

31:40.330 --> 31:43.060
My synapses must be turning to jelly.

31:43.230 --> 31:46.570
The visor's fine.
I just can't see a thing.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.000
How do we locate the beacon?

31:52.170 --> 31:53.740
We don't.

31:58.680 --> 32:02.380
Do all humans give up so easily?

32:02.980 --> 32:07.690
We're lost, unless you've got
something that can smell neutrinos.

32:10.890 --> 32:13.560
We have the sensor device
you are carrying.

32:13.730 --> 32:18.270
Tricorder? It's not set up
to detect neutrinos.

32:18.430 --> 32:21.500
Your eye device does. Connect them.

32:21.670 --> 32:24.170
They don't speak the same language.

32:24.340 --> 32:28.010
Besides, I'd never be able
to get an accurate sampling.

32:28.640 --> 32:30.640
Wait a second.

32:31.510 --> 32:35.150
I wouldn't need an accurate sampling,
just a pointer.

32:36.480 --> 32:38.450
A neutrino Geiger counter.

32:41.260 --> 32:43.320
No, it's still not possible.

32:43.920 --> 32:47.190
- You cannot do it?
- Under normal circumstances, maybe.

32:47.360 --> 32:49.830
Here? No way.

32:50.000 --> 32:53.000
- Why?
- Because I can't see!

32:55.970 --> 33:01.180
Adapting the neural output
of the visor can't be done by touch.

33:06.710 --> 33:10.020
Then I... will be your eyes.

33:17.560 --> 33:22.030
The storm is subsiding. We should
have a window in an hour.

33:22.200 --> 33:25.530
There's still no indication
he's found the beacon.

33:25.700 --> 33:27.700
- Assemble a team.
- Sir.

33:27.870 --> 33:30.840
The Romulan warship
has crossed the border.

33:31.000 --> 33:34.110
It is in Federation space
and heading towards us.

33:34.610 --> 33:36.610
Belay that order, Number One.

33:39.610 --> 33:41.220
Red alert.

33:47.550 --> 33:50.820
Make sure the limiter
matches the output range.

33:50.990 --> 33:52.760
Not so fast.

33:55.500 --> 33:57.630
Now, place the neural output pods

33:57.800 --> 34:00.800
in contact
with the tricorder scanner heads.

34:03.070 --> 34:05.070
- Ready.
- Let her rip.

34:12.810 --> 34:14.679
Bearing three-five-zero.

34:15.920 --> 34:19.750
We did it! The first
Federation-Romulan co-venture.

34:22.620 --> 34:24.460
The storm may be breaking.

34:24.630 --> 34:29.030
With any luck, there'll be
an electromagnetic window opening up.

34:29.199 --> 34:32.199
At which point,
I'll be your prisoner.

34:35.500 --> 34:38.840
- Can you walk?
- I don't know.

34:39.739 --> 34:41.540
Well, let's find out.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.909
Come on.

34:48.750 --> 34:51.420
- OK, let's go.
- Straight ahead.

34:58.030 --> 34:59.830
To the right.

35:02.100 --> 35:03.500
Come.

35:05.830 --> 35:09.370
- You wished to see me?
- Yes, Lieutenant.

35:10.000 --> 35:13.940
- I assume you know what it's about.
- Yes.

35:15.440 --> 35:18.910
The Romulan vessel
will reach us within the hour.

35:20.650 --> 35:22.780
If our patient dies...

35:23.950 --> 35:27.720
...it may be just the excuse
the Romulan commander needs

35:27.890 --> 35:29.660
to start an incident.

35:31.560 --> 35:36.130
The death of a Romulan officer
at the hands of the Federation.

35:36.300 --> 35:38.630
- Think of it.
- I have.

35:39.830 --> 35:46.840
So, there is no question that he is
more valuable to us alive than dead.

35:47.440 --> 35:49.010
I understand.

35:51.680 --> 35:53.280
Lieutenant...

35:55.320 --> 36:02.190
...sometimes, the moral obligations
of command are less than clear.

36:02.360 --> 36:05.390
I have to weigh the good of the many

36:05.560 --> 36:08.030
against the needs of the individual,

36:08.200 --> 36:11.730
and try to balance them
as realistically as possible.

36:11.900 --> 36:14.400
God knows, I don't always succeed.

36:14.570 --> 36:17.640
I have not had cause to complain,
Captain.

36:18.370 --> 36:22.210
Lieutenant, you wouldn't complain
even if you had cause.

36:25.250 --> 36:28.480
If you order me
to agree to the transfusion,

36:28.650 --> 36:30.550
I will obey, of course.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.860
I don't want... to order you.

36:36.220 --> 36:38.430
But I ask you. I...

36:40.330 --> 36:44.430
...beg you to volunteer.

36:44.600 --> 36:46.430
I cannot.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.910
Lieutenant.

37:01.580 --> 37:02.520
Sir?

37:04.320 --> 37:05.990
That will be all.

37:14.500 --> 37:17.600
- Picard to Dr Crusher.
- Go ahead.

37:17.770 --> 37:21.300
Do not continue to enlist
the cooperation of Lt Worf.

37:22.540 --> 37:24.540
I won't have to, Captain.

37:25.210 --> 37:27.270
The Romulan has died.

37:45.660 --> 37:47.460
We've found it!

37:48.560 --> 37:52.800
Now we alter its signal
so the Enterprise knows we found it.

37:52.970 --> 37:56.240
- Will that be difficult?
- Not with your help.

38:01.140 --> 38:03.540
The scanners are showing a window.

38:03.710 --> 38:07.510
- Expected duration?
- Nine minutes, 40 seconds, sir.

38:07.680 --> 38:10.080
No change in the beacon's signal.

38:10.250 --> 38:13.990
Romulan ship approaching.
Bearing 354, mark 287.

38:14.150 --> 38:15.720
On screen.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.600
Entering phaser range.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.230
- We are being hailed, sir.
- On viewer.

38:27.000 --> 38:31.840
You have one chance
to escape destruction, Picard.

38:32.770 --> 38:35.840
Return my officer at once.

38:36.010 --> 38:39.410
You have entered Federation space
despite my warning.

38:39.580 --> 38:41.950
You forced the situation!

38:42.780 --> 38:45.350
I will not leave without him.

38:48.360 --> 38:49.860
He is dead.

38:53.330 --> 38:58.300
Then he...
is but the first to fall, Picard.

38:59.830 --> 39:03.170
The Romulan ship is powering
its forward disruptor.

39:03.300 --> 39:05.140
All shields to maximum.

39:05.870 --> 39:07.310
Aye, sir.

39:07.940 --> 39:09.780
Lock phasers on target.

39:09.940 --> 39:12.280
Phasers locked... and ready.

39:12.910 --> 39:15.580
The signal from the beacon
is modulating.

39:16.320 --> 39:17.350
It's Geordi.

39:17.520 --> 39:19.390
But our shields are up.

39:19.550 --> 39:21.920
Lower them
and the Romulans will strike.

39:22.060 --> 39:26.490
The electromagnetic window
is closing. Three minutes remain.

39:26.660 --> 39:30.030
Transporter room,
lock onto the beam and stand by.

39:30.200 --> 39:31.600
Standing by.

39:31.770 --> 39:34.870
The window is allowing
intermittent readings.

39:35.040 --> 39:39.410
There are ghost images
but we are picking up two life forms.

39:41.380 --> 39:42.880
Another Romulan?

39:42.980 --> 39:44.580
I cannot say.

39:44.750 --> 39:48.280
The interference
prevents an accurate reading.

39:48.450 --> 39:50.920
But that's a likely hypothesis.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.220
If Cmdr La Forge has located
a second survivor...

39:54.390 --> 39:56.090
Lieutenant.

39:56.960 --> 39:59.630
- Hail the Romulan vessel.
- Aye, sir.

40:01.660 --> 40:05.330
- They are ignoring our hail.
- Repeat the hail.

40:05.500 --> 40:09.340
They have no way of knowing
how accurate our sensors are.

40:10.070 --> 40:13.010
Put on your best poker face,
Number One.

40:13.170 --> 40:14.780
Open a frequency.

40:15.480 --> 40:17.080
Cmdr Tomalak.

40:17.780 --> 40:20.580
It would appear
our away team has located

40:20.750 --> 40:24.350
a second man from your one-man ship.

40:24.950 --> 40:27.320
We're preparing to beam them up.

40:27.490 --> 40:30.960
After which,
we will return the survivor to you.

40:32.360 --> 40:34.230
No acknowledgement, sir.

40:36.330 --> 40:39.370
Commander, both our ships
are ready to fight.

40:41.030 --> 40:44.040
We have two extremely powerful

40:44.200 --> 40:47.670
and destructive arsenals
at our command.

40:47.840 --> 40:51.480
Our next actions
will have serious repercussions.

40:52.550 --> 40:54.920
We have reason to mistrust
one another

40:55.080 --> 40:59.320
but even better reason
to set those differences aside.

40:59.490 --> 41:03.890
Of course, the question is,
who will take the initiative?

41:05.590 --> 41:09.430
Who will make
the first gesture of trust?

41:16.470 --> 41:18.270
The answer is, I will.

41:18.410 --> 41:20.440
I must lower our shields

41:20.610 --> 41:24.040
to beam those men
up from the planet's surface.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.820
Once the shields are down,

41:31.950 --> 41:35.120
you will have the opportunity
to fire on us.

41:35.290 --> 41:39.790
If you do, you will destroy
not only the Enterprise and its crew,

41:39.960 --> 41:44.930
but the ceasefire that the Romulans
and the Federation now enjoy.

41:48.170 --> 41:51.000
Lieutenant, lower the shields.

41:52.340 --> 41:54.440
Leave the hailing frequency open.

41:56.210 --> 41:57.950
Yes, sir.

41:58.510 --> 42:00.280
Shields down.

42:01.180 --> 42:05.220
Mr O'Brien, transport La Forge
and the Romulan to the bridge.

42:05.350 --> 42:07.190
Aye, sir. Energising.

42:13.960 --> 42:17.630
- Security to the bridge.
- Belay that order. Shields up.

42:22.240 --> 42:24.540
No one is going to harm you.

42:25.540 --> 42:27.570
You have my word on that.

42:31.180 --> 42:33.310
Well, Commander?

42:35.880 --> 42:39.350
If he has been
in any way mistreated...

42:43.120 --> 42:46.830
I have given them no information,
Commander.

42:46.990 --> 42:49.430
But I have not been mistreated.

42:50.460 --> 42:52.100
In fact...

42:53.330 --> 42:55.840
...this human saved my life.

42:56.770 --> 42:57.810
Tomalak.

42:59.510 --> 43:04.340
How is it possible that you
didn't know of the second Romulan?

43:05.810 --> 43:08.980
A simple misunderstanding,
Capt Picard.

43:09.150 --> 43:13.650
I was misinformed
as to the size of the craft.

43:13.790 --> 43:16.620
I assure you,
I intended no deception.

43:16.790 --> 43:18.460
Of course not.

43:19.290 --> 43:21.200
You doubt my good faith?

43:22.260 --> 43:26.030
My faith would be strengthened
by a gesture from you.

43:26.200 --> 43:28.870
Such as powering down
your disruptors.

43:32.810 --> 43:34.540
Disruptors powering down.

43:35.280 --> 43:38.380
Thank you.
Cancel red alert, Lieutenant.

43:39.480 --> 43:44.180
We shall return your officer
and escort you to the Neutral Zone.

43:44.350 --> 43:45.950
That is acceptable.

43:49.560 --> 43:53.790
- Good to have you back.
- Good to be back.

43:53.890 --> 43:57.230
Actually, I have Centurion Bochra
to thank for it.

43:58.600 --> 43:59.770
Indeed?

44:04.610 --> 44:06.240
Cmdr La Forge

44:06.410 --> 44:08.380
and Lt Worf,

44:08.540 --> 44:11.610
escort our guest
to transporter room one.

44:12.310 --> 44:14.110
Yes, sir.

44:14.280 --> 44:16.080
Come on.

44:19.720 --> 44:22.560
- Close call.
- Too close, Number One.

44:23.660 --> 44:26.330
Brinkmanship is a dangerous game.
