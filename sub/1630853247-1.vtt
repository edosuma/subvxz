02:55.610 --> 02:57.264
- Looks good.
- Thank you.

02:57.307 --> 02:58.874
- Want to pray?
- Yeah.

02:58.917 --> 03:00.745
Okay.
Thank you, Father,

03:00.789 --> 03:03.226
thank you, Father,
for this food, for this food.

03:06.316 --> 03:07.752
Amen.

03:09.319 --> 03:11.234
- Did you finish your work?
- Yeah.

03:11.278 --> 03:13.889
- Um, it was hard, but I called Isabella.
- Isabella?

03:13.932 --> 03:17.022
I thought she was
not a good student.

03:17.066 --> 03:19.634
She is, Dad.
Where'd you hear that from?

03:19.677 --> 03:23.028
Well, you told me last year
she wasn't doing too well.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.813
Especially not
in math.

03:24.856 --> 03:27.207
- That was last year.
- Okay.

03:28.208 --> 03:30.775
What's at 1:30?

03:32.212 --> 03:34.518
Come on.

03:34.562 --> 03:36.259
- Career Day.
- Yeah.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.653
Yeah. I'll be there.

03:38.696 --> 03:41.786
It's just that there's
the time change, and I--

03:41.830 --> 03:43.832
But this is the only time
we have to talk.

03:43.875 --> 03:46.226
I know that.
- Darius, the breakfast is ready.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.879
In a minute!

03:49.316 --> 03:51.361
If we don't FaceTime,
we won't talk.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.884
How will we stay friends?

03:52.928 --> 03:55.191
You need to make
new friends,

03:55.235 --> 03:57.454
- ones that live in your own time zone.
- No, wait, please!

03:57.498 --> 04:00.457
Just go out and meet people.
Make friends.

04:00.501 --> 04:02.764
You'll be happier that way.
You'll see.

04:02.807 --> 04:05.245
- Just, please, hold on.
- Bye, Darius.

04:06.681 --> 04:08.726
Didn't you hear me
calling you?

04:18.127 --> 04:21.348
My huevoshave
gone cold, Rosa.

04:22.523 --> 04:25.743
My huevos
have gone cold.

04:25.787 --> 04:27.397
- Christian?
- Hey.

04:27.441 --> 04:28.920
What are you doing,
man?

04:31.053 --> 04:32.794
I was just meditating.

04:32.837 --> 04:34.839
You all right, man?

04:34.883 --> 04:36.406
Yeah. Yes.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.539
Yeah, I'm good.
I'm awesome.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.019
Bullshit.

04:41.063 --> 04:44.501
Did she kick you out again?
'Cause you can't

04:44.545 --> 04:47.504
keep passing out in your car
like this, man.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.550
You're pissing everybody off
in the building.

04:49.593 --> 04:51.987
Yeah. No, you're right.
Absolutely right.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.728
Cool.
Cool, cool, cool.

04:53.771 --> 04:56.165
Also, it's the 5th,
so if you could

04:56.208 --> 04:58.472
drop your check off in my box,
that would be great.

04:58.515 --> 05:01.083
You know what happens
when it's the 6th.

05:01.953 --> 05:03.346
- That was...
- Huh?

05:03.390 --> 05:05.305
...a one-time thing,
okay?

05:05.348 --> 05:06.915
That's great.

05:08.395 --> 05:09.961
Cool.

05:19.623 --> 05:23.279
Sweetheart, please call us back.
Your dad and I are worried.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.151
We know what happened
with the record label, honey.

05:26.195 --> 05:28.676
I know you must
feel terrible.

05:33.463 --> 05:35.160
We just want you to know

05:35.204 --> 05:37.902
that we love you
no matter what.

05:37.946 --> 05:39.643
Please give us a call, honey.
Please?

05:39.687 --> 05:42.080
- Ugh!
- Ladies.

05:43.604 --> 05:46.041
Well, did you call 911?

05:46.084 --> 05:48.348
- Yes.
- What'd they say?

05:48.391 --> 05:50.306
Well, they said
since he's already dead,

05:50.350 --> 05:53.265
it's not technically
an emergency.

05:53.309 --> 05:55.703
- I don't know about that, but--
- What are you doing?

05:55.746 --> 05:58.445
Documenting. It's the first
part of any investigation.

05:58.488 --> 06:00.577
This isn't
an investigation.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.840
- It is now.
- Ned, stop it.

06:02.884 --> 06:05.234
If I see that
on the Facebook...

06:05.277 --> 06:07.323
Facebook?

06:07.367 --> 06:09.281
I'm on Snapchat.

06:10.544 --> 06:13.285
- I think we should move him.
- Why?

06:13.329 --> 06:16.506
Because the kids are gonna be
walking right by here!

06:17.507 --> 06:19.857
The kids.
That's right.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.772
Do you think
it would hurt him?

06:24.514 --> 06:26.821
- Where should we put him?
- Um, let's put him in the, uh,

06:26.864 --> 06:28.475
uh, up in
the teacher's lounge.

06:28.518 --> 06:29.693
- Okay.
- Okay.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.521
Oh!

06:34.219 --> 06:35.438
Well, good morning.

06:35.482 --> 06:36.787
Good morning.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.789
You're here early,
aren't you?

06:38.833 --> 06:40.400
Uh-huh.

06:40.443 --> 06:42.837
Well, why don't you just
take a seat,

06:42.880 --> 06:44.404
and we'll be
right back.

06:44.447 --> 06:46.318
Okay.

06:46.362 --> 06:47.842
Move!

06:56.067 --> 06:58.113
Stop.

06:58.156 --> 07:00.245
- Wait, please.
- Stop.

07:05.686 --> 07:09.037
They told me to sit here
while they moved the man.

07:10.647 --> 07:12.823
Sounds good to me.

07:16.914 --> 07:18.525
He's gone.

07:38.545 --> 07:41.025
1:30. I don't want you
to be late.

07:41.069 --> 07:42.853
I'm not gonna
be late.

07:42.897 --> 07:44.464
- Promise?
- Yeah.

07:47.118 --> 07:50.774
- Who's that?
- That's Mr. McCrow. He's the music teacher.

07:50.818 --> 07:53.516
Is he smoking
a cigarette?

07:53.560 --> 07:55.344
Two.

07:55.387 --> 07:57.651
Should he be doing that
on campus?

07:57.694 --> 07:59.653
Probably not.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.306
Excuse me.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.700
Excuse me!

08:03.744 --> 08:06.877
Should you be smoking
on school grounds?

08:06.921 --> 08:09.576
- I mean, the guy is smoking three--
- Dad!

08:09.619 --> 08:11.882
- I don't under--
- Dad, I've gotta go.

08:11.926 --> 08:14.885
Okay.
All right.

08:14.929 --> 08:17.671
- One...
- Thirty.

08:26.593 --> 08:28.116
Darius?

08:28.159 --> 08:31.075
Today's
my last day.

08:31.119 --> 08:32.554
What?

08:32.599 --> 08:35.558
I got a new job
with a new family.

08:35.602 --> 08:39.693
I'm sorry. I...
I didn't know how to tell you.

08:39.736 --> 08:41.172
You're leaving me?

08:41.216 --> 08:43.260
It's just
too much moving.

08:44.349 --> 08:46.221
Will I still see you?

08:46.264 --> 08:48.353
I hope so.

08:54.621 --> 08:58.059
Got you some Rolos...
to help you make friends.

09:00.322 --> 09:02.237
Bye, Rosa.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.847
Bye, Darius.

09:14.945 --> 09:17.687
All right, there.

09:17.731 --> 09:20.472
Principal Nichols?

09:20.516 --> 09:22.344
- Jesus!
- I know.

09:22.387 --> 09:25.608
We found him this morning
next to a big pile of manure.

09:25.652 --> 09:27.610
He must've
passed away

09:27.654 --> 09:30.526
before he had a chance to
spread it over the lawn.

09:30.570 --> 09:31.962
It's okay, Mindy.

09:33.355 --> 09:36.140
But it really does
make you think...

09:36.184 --> 09:37.968
about the anonymity
of it all.

09:38.012 --> 09:40.405
I mean, this man tended
to our grounds for a decade.

09:40.449 --> 09:43.234
we don't even
know his name.

09:43.278 --> 09:46.150
- Kevin.
- What?

09:46.194 --> 09:49.763
Kevin.
His name was Kevin.

09:50.851 --> 09:52.592
Kevin.

09:52.635 --> 09:55.290
Thought it'd have been
something more Mex...

09:56.508 --> 09:59.860
more monosyllabic.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.166
Like Joe, maybe,
or, uh, Ted,

10:02.210 --> 10:03.777
You know?
A good Ted.

10:03.820 --> 10:05.517
But Kevin? Ha!

10:05.561 --> 10:08.608
Never heard of a gardener
named Kevin.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.523
Mindy, we need to leave him here
so the kids don't see him.

10:11.567 --> 10:14.962
Now, I've called the paramedics.
They should be here soon. Oh!

10:15.005 --> 10:18.356
You're just a big bag of surprises
this morning, aren't you, Kev!

10:19.488 --> 10:20.968
That'll do, Ned.

10:21.011 --> 10:23.231
Now, we've got to go out
and do morning assembly.

10:23.274 --> 10:25.494
When the paramedics arrive, lead
them here and show them the body.

10:25.537 --> 10:28.976
In the meantime, see if you can find
his emergency contact information.

10:29.019 --> 10:31.979
- We should notify his family.
- Should I close the lounge?

10:32.022 --> 10:34.459
Close the teacher's lounge?

10:34.503 --> 10:37.462
Do you have any idea what kind of
shit storm that would unleash? No!

10:37.506 --> 10:41.728
Okay, but if we're gonna be storing
a corpse here, don't you think--

10:42.903 --> 10:44.774
Hey, morning,
everybody.

10:44.818 --> 10:46.776
Say, did you guys catch
The Voicelast night?

10:46.820 --> 10:50.127
There was this guy,
had the face of a toad.

10:50.171 --> 10:51.912
I mean,
this guy was ugly,

10:51.955 --> 10:53.957
even by amphibian
standards,

10:54.001 --> 10:56.307
but then he opens
his mouth to sing,

10:56.351 --> 10:58.832
and darned if that toad
doesn't just turn into

10:58.875 --> 11:00.834
a strapping young prince
right before your very eyes.

11:00.877 --> 11:02.574
But then I guess that's why
they call it The Voice.

11:02.618 --> 11:04.707
Excuse me.
I'm sorry about this.

11:04.751 --> 11:06.796
All right, have a good day.
I'll see you later.

11:09.930 --> 11:11.714
- Close the lounge.
- Yeah, go ahead and close it.

11:11.758 --> 11:13.368
Now.

11:24.988 --> 11:26.947
- Hello?
- Daniel?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.600
- Yeah?
- Daniel Crawford?

11:28.644 --> 11:29.950
Yes.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.213
This is Bob.

11:32.256 --> 11:33.867
- Bob?
- Nadine's wife.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.825
Husband.
Sorry, I meant husband.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.784
Listen, I know about
you and Nadine.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.569
- What?
- Spare me the bewilderment, Danny.

11:40.612 --> 11:43.050
I know it's happening, you know it's
happening, we both know it's happening.

11:43.093 --> 11:45.443
I'm calling because
I want to get lunch with you.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.271
You want to get lunch
with me?

11:47.315 --> 11:49.317
- Yes.
- Why?

11:49.360 --> 11:51.232
Lots of reasons,

11:51.275 --> 11:52.886
curiosity being the largest,
I guess.

11:52.929 --> 11:55.149
A man having sex
with your wife,

11:55.192 --> 11:57.325
you're naturally inclined
to compare yourself to him.

11:57.368 --> 11:59.762
It's masochistic
but unavoidable.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.417
Oh, and there's one other thing.
I don't want to lie,

12:02.460 --> 12:04.549
so I'm going to be very
up-front about this.

12:04.593 --> 12:07.335
- I may kick your ass.
- No, Bob--

12:07.378 --> 12:09.641
My secretary's going to call Nadine,
and they'll set up a time for us.

12:09.685 --> 12:12.035
I'm totally cock-fucked
with appointments today,

12:12.079 --> 12:13.776
but I think I'll be able
to squeeze it in.

12:13.820 --> 12:16.779
Look, Bob, can I call you
later? Please, this--

12:16.823 --> 12:19.521
Sorry, Daniel, got to run. I've got a
meeting I've been dreading all week.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.784
Shit.

12:21.828 --> 12:24.831
Shit, shit, shit,
shit, shit!

13:10.224 --> 13:12.095
Morning, Daniel.

13:12.966 --> 13:14.402
What's going on here?

13:14.445 --> 13:15.969
The whole office
has gone bat-shit.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.840
- That's what's going on.
- Why?

13:17.884 --> 13:20.016
- They're not saying.
- Who? Who's not?

13:20.060 --> 13:22.976
Building security. It's been
like this since 6: 00 a.m.

13:23.019 --> 13:24.368
They taped off the kitchen
and won't say why.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.892
Can we use
the coffee machine?

13:25.935 --> 13:27.371
Maybe you didn't hear me.

13:27.415 --> 13:30.374
They taped off the kitchen!

13:30.418 --> 13:32.507
How am I supposed to
get to my office?

13:32.550 --> 13:34.248
You got to go down to the lobby
and take the freight elevator.

13:34.291 --> 13:36.685
- Are you kidding?
- Do I look like I'm kidding?

13:36.728 --> 13:39.035

This is ridiculous.

Good morning, Daniel.
I have some--

- Shit.

14:01.057 --> 14:03.320

Oh, I'm glad to hear that. I'm
glad to hear that you're sorry!

14:09.718 --> 14:11.938
In all fairness,
I wasn't acting alone.

14:11.981 --> 14:15.028
Don't you dare try to put this on me.
You took advantage of me!

14:15.071 --> 14:18.509
Took advantage? You sent me an email with
a typo saying you wanted to blow me.

14:18.553 --> 14:21.730
- Well, you took me up on the offer!
- Yeah.

14:21.773 --> 14:24.820

We'll figure this out.

14:24.864 --> 14:27.257

You don't have anyone to lose!

14:30.043 --> 14:31.783
I'm sorry.
That was mean.

14:31.827 --> 14:33.394
Bob wants to have lunch

14:33.437 --> 14:35.483

- My husband, Bob?

14:35.526 --> 14:37.659
- Yes.
- Wants to have lunch with you?

14:37.702 --> 14:39.617
- Yes.
- What's he gonna say to you?

14:39.661 --> 14:41.706
What are you gonna say to him?
What are you gonna tell him?

14:41.750 --> 14:43.708
Are you gonna
tell him about the...

14:43.752 --> 14:45.754
Don't tell him.
Do not tell him.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.365
- Don't talk to Bob!
- I'm telling you because he said

14:48.409 --> 14:51.934
he was going to have his assistant
contact you and schedule it for today.

14:51.978 --> 14:54.981
You can't have lunch with him today. He's
cock-fucked with appointments today.

14:55.024 --> 14:57.940
Yeah, he said that.
He said that exactly, actually.

14:57.984 --> 15:00.160
Oh!

Oh, this is rich.

18:15.703 --> 18:17.183
You ever done
one of those before?

18:17.226 --> 18:19.968
- No.
- Wait, you got a plan?

18:20.011 --> 18:22.144
Those kids
can be rough, man.

18:22.188 --> 18:24.755
It's not like
standing up

18:24.799 --> 18:26.670
and talking in front of
a group of 40-year-olds,

18:26.714 --> 18:28.542
I can tell you that much.

18:28.585 --> 18:30.805
Career day is an event.

18:30.848 --> 18:34.156
It's a happening. It's a happening
of monumental proportions.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.506
Those little fuckers
can be brutal.

18:36.550 --> 18:38.160
You-You've been to one?

18:38.204 --> 18:40.510
Last year. My nephew.

18:40.554 --> 18:42.425
I was sure that
they were gonna love me,

18:42.469 --> 18:45.515
that I was gonna leave
that classroom a champ.

18:45.559 --> 18:48.692
They made me
feel like a loser.

18:48.736 --> 18:50.694
Let me give you
some advice.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.784
Don't lie. They can tell,
and they hate you for it.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.744
- I don't care what they think.
- Yeah, but Patricia cares.

18:56.787 --> 18:58.746
Oh.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.576
We've got a department meeting
in the conference room.

19:02.619 --> 19:05.492
Building security
called it.

19:05.535 --> 19:07.624
Come on.
I'll race you.

19:10.627 --> 19:13.891
All right, everyone,
stop your talking.

19:13.935 --> 19:16.067
Stop your talking!

19:21.638 --> 19:23.684
My name's
Arthur Schneedy.

19:23.727 --> 19:27.253
Corporate transferred me over
here to shape this department up,

19:27.296 --> 19:29.429
and shape it up I shall.

19:31.344 --> 19:33.737
I want to be brief so we can all get
back to work, so I'm just gonna

19:33.781 --> 19:37.088
turn it over to the head of building
security, Melanie Brickman.

19:37.132 --> 19:39.482
- Melanie, you want to take it?
- Uh, it's Melissa, sir.

19:39.526 --> 19:42.137
- Melissa. Melissa Brickman.
- Thank you.

19:42.181 --> 19:44.226
Good morning, people.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.750
My name's
Melissa Brickman.

19:46.794 --> 19:49.144
My friends call me Brick,

19:49.188 --> 19:51.190
but none of you
are my friends,

19:51.233 --> 19:53.888
so you can just disregard that
little peek behind the curtain.

19:53.931 --> 19:56.717
I'm sure you've all noticed

19:56.760 --> 19:59.633
the yellow caution tape
blocking off the hallway,

19:59.676 --> 20:02.026
And I'm sure
the "foodies" among you

20:02.070 --> 20:06.161
have noticed the department
kitchen is closed.

20:06.205 --> 20:07.597
Right?

20:07.641 --> 20:09.643
Well, I'm here
to explain why.

20:09.686 --> 20:12.167
Got here around 5:00
this morning.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.952
Did my usual rounds.
Nothing was out of the ordinary.

20:14.996 --> 20:17.216
Everything seemed
hunky-dory.

20:19.130 --> 20:22.264
It wasn't until about 6:00,
when Mr. Schneedy called

20:22.308 --> 20:24.310
and informed me

20:24.353 --> 20:27.704
that something was,
in fact, amiss.

20:28.879 --> 20:31.142
Mr. Schneedy,

20:31.186 --> 20:33.014
you wanna go ahead and tell them
what you told me?

20:33.057 --> 20:35.277
First thing I did
in the morning,

20:35.321 --> 20:37.453
I made a beeline
for the coffee machine.

20:37.497 --> 20:40.326
I fired that baby up,
I gave her a few minutes,

20:40.369 --> 20:44.286
came back to pour myself
a cup of joe.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.289
but when I tipped the carafe,
nothing came out.

20:47.333 --> 20:49.726
Not a goddamn drop.

20:52.860 --> 20:56.037
At first I was confused,
I was disoriented.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.126
And then I spotted it.

20:58.169 --> 21:02.086
The power cord
had been slashed.

21:02.913 --> 21:04.393
That's right.

21:04.437 --> 21:07.744
Somebody sabotaged
the coffee machine.

21:11.008 --> 21:13.272
Ah, but it gets worse.

21:15.143 --> 21:18.320
Next to the broken
appliance,

21:18.364 --> 21:20.279
I found
the following note:

21:20.322 --> 21:23.456
"Fuck Field Publishing."

21:23.499 --> 21:27.286
And it is adorned
with a god-awful drawing

21:27.329 --> 21:29.331
of a human penis,

21:29.375 --> 21:32.595
just shy of climax.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.684
Now, once Mr. Schneedy

21:34.728 --> 21:36.469
informed us
about the crime,

21:36.512 --> 21:39.341
my boys did a sweep
of the department kitchen

21:39.385 --> 21:41.561
and concluded that

21:41.604 --> 21:43.476
the machine
had been sabotaged,

21:43.519 --> 21:46.479
most likely
over the weekend.

21:46.522 --> 21:49.873
So, the only people who
would've had access are

21:49.917 --> 21:53.050
employees of
Field Publishing,

21:53.094 --> 21:55.009
accounts department,

21:55.052 --> 21:57.011
which means
everyone in this room.

21:57.054 --> 21:59.622
Now, Mr. Schneedy has
requested an investigation,

21:59.666 --> 22:02.669
so we're gonna be setting up shop
in the conference room next door.

22:02.712 --> 22:06.499
We're just gonna ask you all to
stop by, answer a few questions.

22:06.542 --> 22:10.111
With all of your cooperation,
we hope to settle this matter

22:10.154 --> 22:11.939
by the end of the day.

22:14.071 --> 22:16.596
That's all I have for them
at this point, sir.

22:21.731 --> 22:24.430
I'm not a stupid man.

22:26.693 --> 22:28.390
I get it. I'm hip.

22:28.434 --> 22:30.305
Let's keep it real.

22:31.611 --> 22:33.656
I know what
you're all thinking.

22:33.700 --> 22:35.441
New guy comes in.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.225
Whoa.

22:37.268 --> 22:41.142
he's overreacting to
a relatively minor incident,

22:41.185 --> 22:43.536
but let me be clear:

22:43.579 --> 22:47.409
This is not about
an electrical appliance.

22:47.453 --> 22:50.194
This is about vandalism.

22:52.588 --> 22:55.330
All right, you can go.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.464
One more thing. Uh, when
you're done talking to Brick,

22:58.507 --> 23:02.206
I want you to shoot by my
office, introduce yourselves.

23:02.250 --> 23:03.947
I want you to come prepared
with your name,

23:03.991 --> 23:06.515
your favorite work
achievement,

23:06.559 --> 23:08.430
and one interesting fact
about yourself.

23:08.474 --> 23:11.825
It'll be a good way for me
to get to know you all.

23:15.089 --> 23:17.004
- This guy's dead.
- Yeah.

23:17.047 --> 23:18.701
Well, this is
how I found him.

23:18.745 --> 23:20.442
He was lying dead
like this outside

23:20.486 --> 23:22.488
- by a pile of manure.
- A big pile of manure.

23:22.531 --> 23:24.881
He was outside?

23:24.925 --> 23:27.406
- Yes.
- And how did he get inside?

23:28.494 --> 23:30.757
- We moved him.
- You moved him?

23:30.800 --> 23:33.107
You bet we did.

23:33.150 --> 23:35.631
I mean, we had to wheelbarrow him
up those stairs. It was a workout.

23:35.675 --> 23:37.894
Do you know that moving
a dead person

23:37.938 --> 23:39.461
without the consent
of the family

23:39.505 --> 23:41.985
or civic authority
is illegal?

23:42.029 --> 23:43.813
- Totally!
- Wha-- Wha--

23:43.857 --> 23:45.511
She gave the orders
on that one.

23:45.554 --> 23:47.687
Well, what were we
supposed to do?

23:47.730 --> 23:50.167
We can't leave a corpse
in the middle of a field.

23:50.211 --> 23:52.169
This school
isn't public.

23:52.213 --> 23:53.867
Next time you move
a dead body,

23:53.910 --> 23:55.608
just make sure you ask
permission first.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.827
Well, hopefully
there won't be a next time.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.395
Lady, there's always
a next time.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.615
Well, aren't you going to
take him with you?

24:02.658 --> 24:05.444
- We're paramedics.
- So?

24:05.487 --> 24:08.447
We don't deal with dead bodies,
we deal with dying people.

24:08.490 --> 24:10.579
Whoa! So you're just
gonna leave him here?

24:10.623 --> 24:15.018
We can't just drive dead bodies
around the city, okay?

24:15.062 --> 24:18.195
We need to keep our van open
for real medical emergencies.

24:18.239 --> 24:21.068
You know, people with strokes
or heart attacks.

24:21.111 --> 24:23.723
People that have fallen off of
buildings, that sort of thing.

24:23.766 --> 24:25.812
Well, what are we supposed
to do with him?

24:27.291 --> 24:30.469
- Call the coroner.
- Oh, my God. I can't-- No!

24:30.512 --> 24:33.167
You're actually going to leave a
dead body in our teacher's lounge?

24:33.210 --> 24:35.430
You're the one
who moved him.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.479
What are they doing?

24:40.522 --> 24:42.568
They took the donuts.

24:43.830 --> 24:45.962
What... They're not
taking the body?

24:46.006 --> 24:49.226
Well, apparently,
he's too dead for them.

24:49.270 --> 24:51.925
- What?
- Did you tell everyone the lounge is closed?

24:51.968 --> 24:54.884
- Yeah. They weren't too happy.
- No shit.

24:54.928 --> 24:57.496
What about his emergency
contacts?

24:57.539 --> 24:59.410
We don't have anything
on file for him,

24:59.454 --> 25:01.151
so I called
the landscaping company,

25:01.195 --> 25:03.589
but they have four Kevins
on staff.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.417
What? Ha!

25:06.461 --> 25:09.856
Are you serious? They got four
gardeners over there named Kevin?

25:09.899 --> 25:11.510
Yeah. So?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.903
So, I'm still trying to
absorb the fact

25:13.947 --> 25:15.688
that there's one gardener
named Kevin,

25:15.731 --> 25:18.647
and you come in here
and tell me there are four?

25:18.691 --> 25:21.345
I feel like it's a set
of Russian dolls.

25:21.389 --> 25:23.913
I just keep, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin,
Kevin, Kevin, Kevin, Kevin!

25:23.957 --> 25:26.089
- Kevins coming out of my ears!
- Stop!

25:26.133 --> 25:30.137
Just find out which Kevin he is
and contact his family.

25:30.180 --> 25:34.620
In the meantime, I am going to
reach out to the coroner.

25:34.663 --> 25:36.752
Mindy, Mindy, Mindy, wait.
Mindy, Mindy--

25:36.796 --> 25:39.363
The Bayeux Tapestry
is a record

25:39.407 --> 25:42.105
of all the Norman conquests,
which is amazing,

25:42.149 --> 25:44.630
because they were actually
able to weave and--

25:46.153 --> 25:48.764
All right, guys,
see you after art class.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.703
Excuse me.

26:14.747 --> 26:16.531
Can I have a word?

26:16.575 --> 26:18.011
Um, sure.

26:19.403 --> 26:22.363
In private,
if you don't mind.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.234
Okay.

26:29.239 --> 26:31.198
Oh, my gosh!

26:31.241 --> 26:33.461
- Would you like a Rolo?
- What are Rolos?

26:33.504 --> 26:36.769
They're candies.
Adult candies.

26:37.813 --> 26:39.902
Thank you.

26:42.688 --> 26:45.604
So, um, what did you
want to talk to me about?

26:45.647 --> 26:48.302
- I wanted to thank you for helping me this morning.
- Oh, yeah.

26:48.345 --> 26:50.434
Don't worry about it.

26:54.395 --> 26:56.223
It's tough being
the new kid.

26:56.266 --> 26:58.921
People, they seem
to pick on you.

26:58.965 --> 27:00.923
- Yeah.
- I'm used to it, though.

27:00.967 --> 27:03.012
I've been to tons
of different schools.

27:03.056 --> 27:05.885
- You have?
- I just moved from London.

27:05.928 --> 27:09.453
I've lived everywhere--
Chicago, New York,

27:09.497 --> 27:11.325
Mumbai--
that was hot.

27:13.153 --> 27:15.372
- I'm Darius.
- Nice to meet you.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.636
I was named after
Darius the Great.

27:18.985 --> 27:20.769
Who is Darius the Great?

27:20.813 --> 27:23.380
- A musician.
- Cool.

27:23.424 --> 27:26.645
Well, I'm Patricia.
I was named after my grandma.

27:26.688 --> 27:29.865
- I bet she was a lovely woman.
- She's not dead.

27:29.909 --> 27:32.302
Oh, good.

27:36.524 --> 27:38.744
Hey, Christian.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.226
You'll like this.

27:43.270 --> 27:46.926
Mike Friedlander shat his pants
in my class this morning.

27:46.969 --> 27:49.711
Right there
at his desk.

27:49.755 --> 27:51.757
He gets this concentrated
look on his face,

27:51.800 --> 27:54.281
and I'm thinking,
there's no way

27:54.324 --> 27:58.067
he's that into my lecture
on sanding and then... pfft!

27:58.111 --> 28:02.376
Whole room smells like a five-week-old
order of chicken tikka masala.

28:03.638 --> 28:05.466
The boy
is 12 years old.

28:05.509 --> 28:08.382
When does it end?

28:08.425 --> 28:10.689
You all right?
What's going on?

28:13.692 --> 28:16.607
When a man loses
everything,

28:16.651 --> 28:18.914
what's he got left?

28:18.958 --> 28:22.048
Is this a trick question
or something?

28:22.875 --> 28:24.093
No.

28:25.878 --> 28:28.054
Uh... nothing.

28:28.097 --> 28:31.361
If a man loses everything,
he has nothing left.

28:32.319 --> 28:33.842
Yeah, that's about right.

28:33.886 --> 28:38.020
You all right?
You seem more down than usual.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.894
Over the weekend, I had this realization.
It's like,

28:41.937 --> 28:46.246
- we spend our entire lives--
- Shit, they got the table saw.

28:46.289 --> 28:48.770
Isaac!
Put the blade down!

28:48.814 --> 28:50.990
Isaac!

28:51.033 --> 28:53.383
- How long have you lived here?
- My whole life.

28:53.427 --> 28:55.168
Your whole life?

28:55.211 --> 28:57.866
Wow. Must be nice to have
that kind of stability.

28:57.910 --> 29:00.564
- I guess.
- I used to.

29:00.608 --> 29:02.305
Then my mom died.

29:02.349 --> 29:03.959
Your mom died?

29:04.003 --> 29:06.048
Yeah.

29:06.092 --> 29:07.789
My mom did too.

29:07.833 --> 29:09.530
Really? That's so--

29:09.573 --> 29:13.012
Uh, I think we got to go
to class now.

29:13.055 --> 29:14.622
- Right.
- Bye.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.103
Patricia!

29:18.104 --> 29:19.409
Yes?

29:21.847 --> 29:25.024
- Will you go with me?
- Darius--

29:25.067 --> 29:28.375
Look, I know it's
a big decision, so...

29:28.418 --> 29:31.595
how about you think about it and
tell me at lunch before Career Day?

29:33.032 --> 29:34.250
Sure.

29:34.294 --> 29:35.556
Okay.

29:35.599 --> 29:37.471
Patricia?

29:45.392 --> 29:48.090
We got to find
the Swiss Army knife.

29:48.134 --> 29:50.789
- What?
- Find the Swiss Army knife.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.834
What do you mean,
"find the Swiss Army knife"?

29:52.878 --> 29:54.923
Well, clearly whoever did this
used a Swiss Army knife.

29:54.967 --> 29:58.448
- Why do you say that?
- I watch a lot of NCIS, Daniel,

29:58.492 --> 30:02.496
and after a while you pick up on
certain investigative tactics.

30:02.539 --> 30:04.150
Isn't NCISthe navy one?

30:04.193 --> 30:06.065
Just because
the crimes are aquatic

30:06.108 --> 30:07.806
don't mean that the techniques
are any less useful.

30:07.849 --> 30:10.243
Gotta pay attention
to the little details.

30:10.286 --> 30:12.680
That cord was cut clean.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.813
That was a sharp blade.

30:14.856 --> 30:17.380
All we got in the kitchen
are those little plastic knives.

30:17.424 --> 30:19.905
You can't even cut a bagel
with one of those.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.994
No.
It's not a scissor.

30:22.037 --> 30:24.039
That'd be like
gnawing at that cord.

30:24.083 --> 30:26.172
Nah,
this is a sharp blade.

30:26.215 --> 30:28.739
Not a little Swiss Army knife
for your cuticles but, like,

30:28.783 --> 30:31.220
a pocket knife,
Swiss Army knife.

30:31.264 --> 30:33.875
- Kinda makes sense.
- "Kinda"?

30:33.919 --> 30:36.617
No, it does make sense.
It's like The Fugitive.

30:36.660 --> 30:39.838
- I don't want to hear about The Fugitiveagain.
- Find the one-armed man.

30:39.881 --> 30:43.189
But we're not looking for a
one-armed man, we're looking for

30:43.232 --> 30:46.192
a two-armed man with a Swiss Army knife.

30:46.235 --> 30:49.412
- This is Daniel. - Daniel,
security is ready to see you.

30:54.983 --> 30:57.246
- How are you, Daniel?
- Good.

30:57.290 --> 31:00.423
Good. Care for anything to drink?
Water, soda, anything like that?

31:00.467 --> 31:02.295
No, thanks.
I'm okay.

31:02.338 --> 31:04.253
Coffee?

31:04.297 --> 31:06.342
I thought the coffee
machine was broken.

31:06.386 --> 31:07.953
I was just kidding.

31:07.996 --> 31:10.129
You got your wits
about you.

31:10.172 --> 31:13.132
You'd be shocked how many
we fool with that one.

31:13.175 --> 31:14.873
Okay, children,

31:14.916 --> 31:17.223
little ones, friends.

31:17.266 --> 31:20.008
Jesus.

31:22.881 --> 31:25.274
Look, um, I know
I said we would be

31:25.318 --> 31:28.712
working on recorders today,
which is fun,

31:28.756 --> 31:31.019
always is, but, um...

31:31.063 --> 31:33.282
there's been
a change of plans.

31:33.326 --> 31:35.981
Uh...
What's up, Nathan?

31:36.024 --> 31:37.852
I need to go
to the bathroom.

31:37.896 --> 31:41.334
I sympathize with you,
my man, but, um,

31:41.377 --> 31:43.510
I can't let anybody
leave today, all right?

31:43.553 --> 31:45.947
The lesson's just
too important,

31:45.991 --> 31:47.557
yeah, and, uh...

31:47.601 --> 31:50.473
it actually might be
the most important lesson

31:50.517 --> 31:53.433
that you've ever learned,
and, uh, trust me,

31:53.476 --> 31:55.914
you'll learn it.

31:55.957 --> 31:59.265
I'll get started.
Okay, so, uh...

31:59.308 --> 32:02.442
today, guys,
I just want to

32:02.485 --> 32:04.705
talk to you about...

32:07.664 --> 32:10.624
- Fear?
- Failure!

32:10.667 --> 32:12.669
Yeah.

32:12.713 --> 32:14.541
Failure.

32:14.584 --> 32:17.413
What time did you arrive
at work this morning, Daniel?

32:17.457 --> 32:19.763
Around 9:00, I think.

32:19.807 --> 32:22.288
When you got here at 9:00,
what did you do?

32:22.331 --> 32:24.551
I walked in,
and I saw,

32:24.594 --> 32:27.641
you know, the...
the crime scene.

32:27.684 --> 32:30.600
I asked what was going on,
and then I went into my office.

32:30.644 --> 32:33.212
Daniel,

32:33.255 --> 32:35.301
look me in the eye.

32:35.344 --> 32:37.912
Did you sabotage
the coffee machine?

32:37.956 --> 32:40.306
- Are you serious?
- Oh, I'm dead serious.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.699
- It's a simple yes-or-no question.
- No.

32:42.743 --> 32:45.659
Daniel,
look me in the eyes.

32:45.702 --> 32:47.530
- Did you sabotage--
- No!

32:47.574 --> 32:49.141
Let me finish
the question.

32:49.184 --> 32:51.012
I know what
you're going to ask.

32:51.056 --> 32:54.059
Wow. You seem to have a strange
affinity for telepathy.

32:54.102 --> 32:57.279
I did not sabotage
the coffee machine.

32:59.194 --> 33:01.327
That'll be all, Mr. Crawford.
Thank you.

33:03.416 --> 33:06.027
- You all right?
- No, it's a full-on interrogation.

33:06.071 --> 33:08.116
What?

33:13.078 --> 33:15.602
Hey, don't forget to
go meet the new boss.

33:17.952 --> 33:19.562
Damn it!

33:20.694 --> 33:22.565
Yell at me...

33:22.609 --> 33:25.046
And it all
boils down to this.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.048
All right, this is the moment
of clarity, wherein

33:27.092 --> 33:30.878
pessimism gives way
to nihilism,

33:30.921 --> 33:34.316
and nihilism gives way
to acceptance, right?

33:34.360 --> 33:37.711
We will all reach this day.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.844
And for me,

33:40.888 --> 33:42.629
that day...

33:43.673 --> 33:45.675
is today.

33:47.329 --> 33:49.462
Today's that day.

33:49.505 --> 33:52.291
- Daniel Crawford.
- Go on in, hon.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.078
Daniel Crawford, sir.

33:59.167 --> 34:01.517
- Please.
- Thank you.

34:02.736 --> 34:05.391
How was your, uh,
meeting with Brick?

34:05.434 --> 34:08.784
Fine. I mean,
it was a little intense.

34:08.829 --> 34:11.136
Intense? How?

34:11.179 --> 34:14.922
They're really just treating this
whole thing like it's a major crime.

34:16.271 --> 34:19.100
Which makes sense.

34:19.143 --> 34:21.797
Well, the whole purpose
of this sit-down is just

34:21.842 --> 34:24.801
for me to get to know you,
so... let's hear it.

34:24.844 --> 34:27.543
Okay. My name
is Daniel Crawford.

34:27.587 --> 34:29.893
My proudest
work achievement,

34:29.937 --> 34:33.549
I would say,
I-I guess, is...

34:33.592 --> 34:36.813
securing the Bridgewater
account-- that was a big deal.

34:36.857 --> 34:39.033
- The Bridgewater account?
- Yes.

34:39.077 --> 34:41.469
That was--
That was your achievement?

34:41.514 --> 34:43.777
You mean, was I
personally responsible?

34:43.820 --> 34:47.128
- Yeah.
- No, but it was a team, you know--

34:47.172 --> 34:51.350
Well, then, that's not really
your achievement, is it?

34:51.393 --> 34:53.960
I mean, can you think
of anything that you've done

34:54.004 --> 34:56.964
that other people
didn't have a hand in?

34:57.007 --> 34:59.140
Yeah. Yeah.

34:59.184 --> 35:01.490
Does it have to be
recent?

35:01.534 --> 35:04.798
Jesus, Daniel, it's not supposed
to be a difficult question.

35:04.841 --> 35:06.887
The thing is,

35:06.930 --> 35:09.237
- I'm an account manager, so--
- So?

35:09.281 --> 35:12.240
So, the job I do
is mostly administrative.

35:12.284 --> 35:14.112
- So?
- So, it's like,

35:14.155 --> 35:16.418
what I do is help
the ship run smoothly.

35:16.462 --> 35:18.942
it's not like I would have
a ton of achievements, per se.

35:18.986 --> 35:22.642
I didn't ask you for a ton,
Daniel, I asked you for one.

35:24.339 --> 35:26.602
Yeah.

35:26.646 --> 35:28.430
you know, I...

35:28.474 --> 35:30.563
I write
the company newsletter.

35:30.606 --> 35:32.956
The company
newsletter?

35:33.000 --> 35:36.699
Yes, I-I write it.

35:36.743 --> 35:40.181
The company
newsletter.

35:41.443 --> 35:43.532
- Yes.
- Okay, uh,

35:43.576 --> 35:45.534
why don't we just,
uh, move on.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.711
Tell me something interesting
about yourself.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.238
Well, something
interesting about me?

35:53.281 --> 35:54.935
Yeah.

35:55.805 --> 35:57.155
I play guitar.

35:58.460 --> 36:00.854
Acoustic
or electric?

36:00.897 --> 36:03.117
Mostly acoustic.

36:03.161 --> 36:05.772
That's not interesting,
Daniel.

36:06.816 --> 36:08.557
Not interesting
at all.

36:09.689 --> 36:11.125
Well...

36:14.389 --> 36:16.348
- Psst!
- What?

36:16.391 --> 36:18.176
Have you thought about it?

36:18.219 --> 36:19.829
I thought I had
until break.

36:19.873 --> 36:23.485
You do. I just thought
I would check in, you know?

36:23.529 --> 36:26.227
Oh, well, um, I haven't
really been thinking about it.

36:26.271 --> 36:28.969
Okay, great.
No problem.

36:36.629 --> 36:38.021
Psst!

36:38.065 --> 36:40.023
- What?
- I just wanted to let you know

36:40.067 --> 36:42.069
while you're thinking
about it

36:42.112 --> 36:44.027
that I'm a really
great guy.

36:44.071 --> 36:46.247
I always look both ways
before I cross the street,

36:46.291 --> 36:49.032
and I don't kill bugs
unless they look poisonous.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.426
I'll take it all
into account.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.602
Great, thanks.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.522
- Psst!
- What?

37:00.566 --> 37:02.176
Can I borrow
a pencil?

37:02.220 --> 37:04.831
Oh, yeah. Sure.

37:06.049 --> 37:08.095
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

37:08.138 --> 37:09.923
Daniel, hey,
you get my message?

37:09.966 --> 37:11.794
I know I said
we could do lunch,

37:11.838 --> 37:13.970
but it's gonna have to be
coffee instead.

37:14.014 --> 37:16.321
I've been getting butt-punked
with meetings all morning.

37:16.364 --> 37:18.236
3:00 work for you?

37:18.279 --> 37:20.194
Actually, no.
That's why I called.

37:20.238 --> 37:22.327
It doesn't. I have my daughter's
Career Day this afternoon.

37:22.370 --> 37:24.677
I know that.
My wife is your assistant.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.983
I'm pretty in the loop as far
as your schedule is concerned.

37:27.027 --> 37:29.943
Right, but I don't know how long
Career Day's gonna last,

37:29.986 --> 37:32.815
and I don't know if there's
some type of thing afterward.

37:32.859 --> 37:34.948
- You mean like an after-party?
- Yeah.

37:34.991 --> 37:38.604
Is Jay Z's kid
in the class?

37:38.647 --> 37:41.215
Look, Bob, the truth is,
I don't want to meet.

37:41.259 --> 37:43.783
No "buts," goddamn it! You put
your vagina in my wife's cock!

37:43.826 --> 37:46.699
Cock in my wife's vagina!
You know what I mean.

37:46.742 --> 37:49.658
You fucked my wife.
And now you owe me coffee.

37:49.702 --> 37:51.921
And I mean that in a figurative
and literal sense,

37:51.965 --> 37:54.097
because I fully expect you
to pay!

37:54.141 --> 37:56.752
- I'll see you at 3:00, Daniel.
- Look, Bob, that's...

38:00.930 --> 38:03.672
All right, everybody,
that's enough for today.

38:05.718 --> 38:07.850
Patricia!
It's break.

38:07.894 --> 38:09.591
Have you decided?

38:11.767 --> 38:13.378
- Yes.
- Really?

38:13.421 --> 38:15.205
No, I didn't mean
"yes" like "yes,"

38:15.249 --> 38:16.990
I meant, "Yes, I've come
to a decision."

38:17.033 --> 38:18.905
Oh.

38:18.948 --> 38:20.689
Look, Darius, um,

38:20.733 --> 38:24.693
I'm sorry, but I don't
want to go out with you.

38:24.737 --> 38:26.869
Is it because I'm new?

38:26.913 --> 38:29.394
No, no. It has nothing
to do with that.

38:29.437 --> 38:31.744
But if you knew me
better,

38:31.787 --> 38:33.398
maybe you would
have said yes.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.051
I mean, it's true
I don't know you, but--

38:35.095 --> 38:38.533
- I see.
- Uh, are you okay?

38:38.577 --> 38:40.448
Yeah.

38:40.492 --> 38:42.494
Are you sure?

38:42.537 --> 38:44.147
Yes.

38:44.191 --> 38:46.236
Oh. Oh, no.
Please don't cry.

38:46.280 --> 38:48.413
It's just...

38:49.979 --> 38:52.242
I've had
a really hard day.

38:53.983 --> 38:55.811
Sorry.

38:58.553 --> 39:01.251
Yes, well, I've been trying
all morning. Your line's been busy.

39:01.295 --> 39:04.298
Yes, and they told me
to call you.

39:04.342 --> 39:08.389
Look, just get here
as soon as you can.

39:08.433 --> 39:10.565
Well, how long
will that be?

39:12.132 --> 39:14.352
All right, fine.
Thank you.

39:17.224 --> 39:19.008
So, what'd
the coroner say?

39:19.052 --> 39:21.184
They said
they'd be here ASAP.

39:21.228 --> 39:22.838
What does that mean?

39:22.882 --> 39:24.710
Well, hopefully
within the hour.

39:24.753 --> 39:27.887
- No, what does "ASAP" mean?
- A-S-A-P.

39:28.888 --> 39:30.890
Oh, my God.

39:30.933 --> 39:32.326
It means,

39:32.370 --> 39:35.111
"as soon as possible."

39:35.155 --> 39:39.289
Okay. So, do they think they'll
be here before Career Day starts?

39:39.333 --> 39:41.770
How the hell
do I know, Ned?

39:42.641 --> 39:44.599
Okay, so I reached out

39:44.643 --> 39:46.514
to all the emergency contacts
for all the Kevins,

39:46.558 --> 39:48.429
and they're insisting that
their Kevin is still alive.

39:48.473 --> 39:51.345
Well, one of them
is wrong.

39:51.389 --> 39:53.826
Yes, one is wrong,
but which one?

39:53.869 --> 39:56.089
Look, until we can say for sure
which one it is,

39:56.132 --> 39:57.656
I don't feel comfortable
calling these people.

39:57.699 --> 39:59.701
Okay. I understand.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.096
Lounge is closed.

40:03.139 --> 40:06.229
- Is this a joke?
- I said the lounge is closed.

40:06.273 --> 40:08.754
How come he gets
to be in here?

40:08.797 --> 40:11.017
Gary, please?

40:11.060 --> 40:13.367
So the faculty gets cast out
into the wilderness,

40:13.411 --> 40:16.457
but the fucking gardener gets to
nosh on bear claws all day?

40:16.501 --> 40:17.937
This is bullshit.

40:17.980 --> 40:20.113
All right, all...

40:21.810 --> 40:24.465
how long before the
parents start showing up?

40:24.509 --> 40:27.163
Not long, and we need
to start preparing

40:27.207 --> 40:29.165
for situations like this.

40:29.209 --> 40:31.864
Somebody could stumble in here
before the coroner gets here

40:31.907 --> 40:33.692
and destroys the body.

40:33.735 --> 40:35.607
Coroners don't destroy
bodies, Ned.

40:35.650 --> 40:37.870
Mindy, please.

40:37.913 --> 40:41.264
Let's not lose the forest
for the tree.

40:41.308 --> 40:43.832
Oh, my God.
Well, I'll be damned.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.443
What?

40:45.486 --> 40:47.053
He's got
a lottery ticket.

40:47.096 --> 40:49.098
So?

40:49.142 --> 40:51.144
So, it's a winner.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.493
I doubt it.

40:52.537 --> 40:53.712
How much?

40:53.755 --> 40:55.453
Uh, I have no idea.

40:55.496 --> 40:57.629
I can never figure
these fucking things out.

40:57.672 --> 41:00.066
All right, let's see.
"Match three, show a prize.

41:00.109 --> 41:03.156
Two diamonds doubles the prize.
Treasure chest triples the prize."

41:03.199 --> 41:05.158
Huh?
Okay, so he's...

41:05.201 --> 41:06.986
What is he?

41:07.029 --> 41:09.510
Hey, he won a free ticket.

41:09.554 --> 41:12.600
- That is not a win.
- How is that not a win?

41:12.644 --> 41:15.473
It's just a ruse to get you to
play this stupid game again.

41:15.516 --> 41:17.475
Well, I'm keeping it.

41:17.518 --> 41:19.825
Uh, you can't keep
a dead man's lottery ticket.

41:19.868 --> 41:22.654
News flash, Mindy: You can't
move a dead man either,

41:22.697 --> 41:25.831
but we did that, at what, 7:30
this morning, so I'm good.

41:25.874 --> 41:27.746
- Throw it out, Ned.
- No way.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.749
Ned...

41:30.792 --> 41:33.403
I will buy you 10 tickets.
Just throw that one out.

41:33.447 --> 41:36.885
Ten? I'm gonna hold you to that.
Mindy, you're my witness.

41:36.929 --> 41:40.062
Okay, fine.
I'm your witness. God.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.114
You got another coffee?

41:48.157 --> 41:50.464
I'm sorry
I didn't get you one.

41:50.508 --> 41:52.945
She just brought it to me
'cause of my knee.

41:52.988 --> 41:55.904
- You're just gonna rub it in my
face-- - Daniel Crawford?

41:55.948 --> 41:59.168
- Yes?
- Mr. Schneedy wants to see you.

42:22.714 --> 42:24.629
You wanted to see me?

42:24.672 --> 42:27.588
Nadine just met with Brick
in the conference room,

42:27.632 --> 42:29.764
and...

42:29.808 --> 42:32.158
she told her something
very interesting.

42:32.201 --> 42:34.247
She did?

42:35.465 --> 42:37.337
Why don't you sit?

42:44.823 --> 42:47.521
I'm-- I'm sorry.

42:47.565 --> 42:49.523
You're sorry?

42:49.567 --> 42:51.960
Yes, I'm sorry.

42:52.004 --> 42:55.877
I don't know what else to say.
I'm embarrassed.

42:55.921 --> 42:58.532
Well, you should be. It's a
goddamn place of business.

42:58.576 --> 43:00.490
You can't behave
like a child

43:00.534 --> 43:02.580
and not expect to face
the consequences.

43:02.623 --> 43:04.538
I know. You're right.

43:04.582 --> 43:06.758
Yeah, I know I'm right.
I'm your boss.

43:06.801 --> 43:10.326
Well, for what it's worth,
it ended this morning.

43:10.370 --> 43:13.982
Her husband found out,
and...

43:14.026 --> 43:17.638
she pretty much hates me now,
so... it's over.

43:17.682 --> 43:19.640
What the hell
are you talking about?

43:20.859 --> 43:23.644
Wait, what exactly
did Nadine say?

43:23.688 --> 43:25.428
Sweet holy Lord.

43:27.169 --> 43:29.302
You're having an affair
with your assistant?

43:29.345 --> 43:31.957
I thought
that's what she told Brick.

43:32.000 --> 43:34.437
No, she said that you were the one
who sabotaged the coffee machine.

43:34.481 --> 43:36.526
- What?
- You're cramming Nadine?

43:36.570 --> 43:38.964
She said I sabotaged
the coffee machine?

43:39.007 --> 43:41.357
- Do you have any idea how reckless that is?
- What did she say?

43:41.401 --> 43:43.316
I told you what she said.
She said that

43:43.359 --> 43:45.492
you were the one who sabotaged
the coffee machine.

43:45.535 --> 43:47.842
- Two other assistants are backing--
- Two? Who?

43:47.886 --> 43:50.976
Daniel, they overheard
you making plans last Friday.

43:51.019 --> 43:53.152
Plans? Are you
fucking kidding me?

43:53.195 --> 43:55.763
How much planning do I have
to do to slash an electric cord

43:55.807 --> 43:58.374
and write "Fuck Field
Publishing" on a slip of paper?

43:58.418 --> 44:01.421
I don't know, Daniel. I don't know the
inner workings of the criminal mind.

44:01.464 --> 44:04.685
You believe this bullshit?
This is horseshit!

44:04.729 --> 44:07.209
- I don't see why she should lie.
- I just told you she hates me.

44:07.253 --> 44:10.560
Yeah, well, we have two other
assistants backing up their story.

44:10.604 --> 44:13.085
Or did you break off affairs
with those too?

44:13.128 --> 44:15.261
They're her friends.
You know how assistants are.

44:15.304 --> 44:16.915
Actually, I don't know
how assistants are.

44:16.958 --> 44:18.960
You know why?
'Cause I don't fuck 'em.

44:19.004 --> 44:20.658
- I didn't--
- You're fired.

44:20.701 --> 44:21.963
What?

44:22.007 --> 44:23.486
You're fired.

44:23.530 --> 44:25.706
Pack up your shit,
put it in a box,

44:25.750 --> 44:28.230
and then follow your wandering
dick out of the building.

44:31.059 --> 44:32.582
Thanks.

44:36.586 --> 44:39.807
I did not sabotage
the coffee machine.

44:44.769 --> 44:46.596
Escort.

44:52.341 --> 44:54.343
Can I help you? 'Cause I'm
trying to get some work done.

44:54.387 --> 44:56.694
- You got me fired.
- What?

44:56.737 --> 44:58.043
I lost my job, Nadine.

44:58.086 --> 45:00.480
- Daniel, they fired you?
- Yes.

45:00.523 --> 45:03.178
I got fired, and now I have to go
speak at Patricia's Career Day.

45:03.222 --> 45:05.137
Nadine, I'm out of cover sheets
for the memos.

45:05.180 --> 45:07.530
Hang on
just a second, Aaron.

45:07.574 --> 45:10.577
- I am so sorry. I didn't mean ever--
- Maybe you didn't hear me.

45:10.620 --> 45:12.710
- Excuse me one second.
- Sorry. This is important.

45:12.753 --> 45:14.450
- Why would you actually-- - I'm
out of cover sheets for memos.

45:14.494 --> 45:17.410
I'm having a conversation.
Hang on just a minute.

45:17.453 --> 45:19.325
- Why would you tell him that I did that?
- I am so sorry.

45:19.368 --> 45:21.849
- Aaron, please!
- It's what you intended!

45:21.893 --> 45:24.373
- We're having a conversation!
- Could you hold up for a second?

45:24.417 --> 45:26.593
- You intended this!
- I need the cover sheets.

45:26.636 --> 45:28.856
- Aaron, please! Daniel, wait.
- Just give me the cover sheets.

45:28.900 --> 45:32.251
Right here. Right up here.

45:32.991 --> 45:35.210
- Here!
- Thank you.

45:37.256 --> 45:39.475
It's pretty easy.

45:39.519 --> 45:42.043
- All you had to do is just reach in a drawer--
- Dude...

47:03.908 --> 47:05.605
Okay.

47:05.648 --> 47:07.563
Just hand me your keycard,
and you're good to go.

47:10.175 --> 47:11.741
All right.

47:14.048 --> 47:16.746
- How are you?
- What?

47:16.790 --> 47:20.098
How are you? I mean,
you've had such a crazy day--

47:20.141 --> 47:22.535
losing your job,
your plot getting foiled.

47:22.578 --> 47:24.450
There wasn't a plot.

47:24.493 --> 47:27.018
You don't have to justify
yourself to me, okay?

47:27.061 --> 47:29.411
This is not the judicial part
of the office.

47:29.455 --> 47:32.414
This is Human Resources.

47:32.458 --> 47:35.461
I am a human being.
You are a human being.

47:35.504 --> 47:38.768
We are humans,
being together.

47:38.812 --> 47:40.770
I just want to know
you're doing okay.

47:40.814 --> 47:44.731
- I'm not. I'm not okay.
- Hmm.

47:44.774 --> 47:48.517
That's what I figured,
given your recent infractions,

47:48.561 --> 47:50.519
but...

47:50.563 --> 47:52.739
I wanted to hear
you say it.

47:52.782 --> 47:54.915
Thanks for
all your good work.

47:54.959 --> 47:56.961
Oh, hey, well, you know,

47:57.004 --> 47:58.963
you train, you prepare,
and when the shit hits the fan,

47:59.006 --> 48:02.227
you just hope that
muscle memory kicks in.

48:02.270 --> 48:04.316
Well, it did, and I thank you.
Now you should go.

48:04.359 --> 48:06.971
Oh, yeah. Um, okay.

48:07.014 --> 48:09.887
We need the conference room.
Also, I got to head out early.

48:09.930 --> 48:11.889
Yes, sir.

48:15.675 --> 48:17.764
No one cares.

48:18.808 --> 48:20.767
No one cares at all.

48:22.203 --> 48:24.249
You all right there,
pal?

48:24.292 --> 48:26.904
Looks like you're having
a rough go.

48:28.644 --> 48:32.126
- Do you want to talk about it?
- That's okay.

48:32.170 --> 48:34.912
You wouldn't understand.

48:34.955 --> 48:36.696
Maybe not,

48:36.739 --> 48:38.916
but it couldn't hurt
to try, right?

48:38.959 --> 48:40.265
Come on.

48:43.442 --> 48:45.879
Maybe we should talk
outside.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.402
Nonsense.

48:47.446 --> 48:50.057
A little bacteria here and there
is good for you.

48:50.101 --> 48:52.059
Helps the immune system.

48:52.103 --> 48:53.931
Come on.

48:57.673 --> 48:59.893
So what's going on?

48:59.937 --> 49:02.069
Do you have someone
to share your life with?

49:02.113 --> 49:04.376
You mean like,
am I married?

49:04.419 --> 49:06.726
Yes.

49:06.769 --> 49:09.250
How long have you and
your wife been together?

49:09.294 --> 49:11.949
Mm, seven years.

49:13.907 --> 49:17.606
Would you say you enjoy
being with her?

49:19.304 --> 49:21.654
Yes, most of the time.

49:22.916 --> 49:25.658
Would you say
she's your everything?

49:25.701 --> 49:27.138
What?

49:27.181 --> 49:29.270
Would you say
she's your everything?

49:31.490 --> 49:34.145
Uh, if pressed,

49:34.188 --> 49:37.017
yes, I would say
she's my everything.

49:37.061 --> 49:39.280
She's your everything.

49:39.324 --> 49:41.021
She's my everything.

49:41.065 --> 49:42.327
Your everything.

49:42.370 --> 49:44.459
- My everything.
- Everything.

49:44.503 --> 49:48.333
Okay, we've established her importance.
Let's move on.

49:49.464 --> 49:51.640
If a man loses everything,

49:51.684 --> 49:53.468
what does he have left?

49:53.512 --> 49:55.905
- Have you been talking to Mr. McCrow?
- Who?

49:55.949 --> 49:59.735
Never mind.
It's just... nothing.

49:59.779 --> 50:02.216
Um, nothing.

50:02.260 --> 50:06.264
If a man loses everything,
he has nothing left.

50:07.091 --> 50:09.006
Thank you.

50:10.050 --> 50:12.400
You've been
very helpful.

50:15.664 --> 50:17.449
You got it.

50:35.554 --> 50:37.860
I can't picture
her face anymore.

50:37.904 --> 50:39.601
When I try,

50:39.645 --> 50:42.126
all I get is fuzzy features
and hazy eyes.

50:42.169 --> 50:45.346
I lived with her
for 15 years,

50:45.390 --> 50:49.002
and I can't remember what she looks like,
and I know she looks like our daughter,

50:49.046 --> 50:50.960
but I can't remember.

50:51.004 --> 50:52.701
I can't...

50:52.745 --> 50:56.096
Have you tried dating
or seeing someone else?

50:56.140 --> 50:58.620
No. No.

50:58.664 --> 51:01.536
Though I got involved
with Nadine.

51:01.580 --> 51:02.972
Which...

51:03.016 --> 51:06.541
- That was stupid.
- Nadine, Nadine, Nadine.

51:06.585 --> 51:08.891
It got me fired, and now
I have a meeting with Bob.

51:08.935 --> 51:11.111
Who's Bob?

51:11.155 --> 51:12.895
Nadine's husband.

51:12.939 --> 51:15.898
Why are you meeting
with her husband?

51:15.942 --> 51:18.249
He wants to get coffee
at 3:00.

51:18.292 --> 51:20.425
Scratch that, 3:30.

51:20.468 --> 51:23.384
And I have to go to
my daughter's Career Day.

51:23.428 --> 51:26.822
I have to speak at my daughter's
Career Day. What am I gonna say?

51:26.866 --> 51:30.130
I would not mention
the coffeemaker

51:30.174 --> 51:32.524
or getting fired

51:32.567 --> 51:34.003
or Nadine.

51:35.396 --> 51:37.529
Well, Daniel,
I'd love to talk all day,

51:37.572 --> 51:40.271
but I do still
work here, so...

51:40.314 --> 51:43.317
This does mark the end of your
tenure here at Field Publishing,

51:43.361 --> 51:46.973
but I just want you to know
that I am available to you.

51:47.016 --> 51:49.062
Okay? If you're
ever in distress,

51:49.106 --> 51:51.673
need support,
or just a friendly voice,

51:51.717 --> 51:54.111
I'm just a phone call away,
okay?

51:54.154 --> 51:57.766
I may not be a registered therapist,
but I am a registered friend.

51:58.941 --> 52:01.205
Thank you.

52:01.248 --> 52:03.772
All right, good luck
out there, okay?

52:03.816 --> 52:05.470
- Yeah.
- Gonna need it.

52:05.513 --> 52:08.429
Oh, hey, Daniel?
I should mention to you

52:08.473 --> 52:11.258
that Mr. Schneedy
requested that we cite

52:11.302 --> 52:13.608
improper conduct as the reason
for your termination,

52:13.652 --> 52:16.524
so you won't get unemployment
in this state.

52:16.568 --> 52:19.266
- Serious?
- I know.

52:19.310 --> 52:21.442
It's like, my hands
are so tied, you know,

52:21.486 --> 52:23.314
but I think part
of being human--

52:23.357 --> 52:25.142
You're an asshole.

52:26.534 --> 52:28.057
Beth!

52:30.712 --> 52:33.062
See him out!

52:33.106 --> 52:35.239
Uh, let's see. Where
did we leave off last time?

52:35.282 --> 52:38.024
We were talking
about the mayor.

52:38.067 --> 52:40.592
Does anybody remember
where we left-- Patricia?

52:40.635 --> 52:42.768
Um, Darius is gone.

52:42.811 --> 52:45.074
- What?
- Darius, the new kid?

52:46.163 --> 52:47.860
Oh. No, he was here.

52:47.903 --> 52:49.644
Um, but he's not now.

52:49.688 --> 52:51.907
Well, you know what?
He probably got lost.

52:51.951 --> 52:53.953
If he's not back in five
minutes, I'll go look for him.

52:53.996 --> 52:55.476
Okay.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.478

54:18.255 --> 54:20.082
No, don't do that!

No, no, no, no, no.
They're already too late.

54:22.389 --> 54:24.652
If anything, we should call them
and tell them not to come,

54:24.696 --> 54:27.438
so we won't have to carry a dead body
out in the middle of Career Day.

54:27.481 --> 54:30.267
All right. You should

All right,
the format is pretty simple.

55:11.133 --> 55:14.093
- Do you have dreams?
- Dreams?

55:14.136 --> 55:15.834
Yeah, like goals,

55:15.877 --> 55:17.879
ambitions,
stuff like that.

55:17.923 --> 55:20.795
I don't know. I guess.

55:20.839 --> 55:22.797
Over the weekend,
I had a realization.

55:22.841 --> 55:25.409
We all have these
grand aspirations

55:25.452 --> 55:28.063
and these dreams

55:28.107 --> 55:30.718
that we're never
gonna live up to.

55:45.124 --> 55:47.953
We're just
gonna go alphabetically.

55:50.869 --> 55:53.001
- What the fuck?
- Oh, God.

55:53.045 --> 55:55.352
What the
hell are you doing here?

55:55.395 --> 55:59.268
My kid's in this class.
What are you doing here?

55:59.312 --> 56:02.620
I just-- I just
love Career Days.

56:02.663 --> 56:05.144
Excuse me. I'm sorry.
Uh...

56:05.187 --> 56:08.756
- Is this Miss Arin's 6th-grade class?
- Yes, you're in the right place.

56:08.800 --> 56:12.586
- Great.
- I just want you guys to pay attention today and really be--

56:12.630 --> 56:15.110
What's your dream?

56:15.154 --> 56:17.765
I wanted to be
a musician.

56:17.809 --> 56:19.985
Were you any good?

56:20.812 --> 56:23.118
Yeah, I was good.

56:23.162 --> 56:24.555
I was pretty good.

56:24.598 --> 56:26.295
You know,
I think I was good.

56:26.339 --> 56:28.036
But it doesn't matter.

56:28.080 --> 56:32.084
I'm gonna die having never
done anything, ever.

56:32.127 --> 56:35.566
- The thing about hospice is...
- This is awkward.

56:35.609 --> 56:37.916
Yeah.

56:37.959 --> 56:41.006
You know, if I had any idea
you were gonna be here today,

56:41.049 --> 56:43.965
I would've waited to
fire you till tomorrow.

56:44.009 --> 56:47.491
- Wow. You got a big heart.
- Oh, don't patronize me.

56:47.534 --> 56:49.580
- Don't talk to me.
- Shut up.

56:49.623 --> 56:52.626
Well, my dad's name
is Daniel Crawford,

56:52.670 --> 56:54.933
and he works for a magazine
publishing firm

56:54.976 --> 56:56.804
called Field Publishing.

56:56.848 --> 57:00.155
Oh, yeah. This'll be good.

57:18.913 --> 57:21.307
Um, would you like a minute,
Mr. Crawford?

57:21.350 --> 57:23.265
- Hmm?
- Would you like a minute?

57:23.309 --> 57:26.443
No, no. I'm fine,
I'm fine.

57:26.486 --> 57:28.836
Well, first of all,

57:28.880 --> 57:30.925
I don't work for
Field Publishing anymore.

57:30.969 --> 57:33.145
I got fired today.

57:33.188 --> 57:35.539
So technically
I'm unemployed.

57:35.582 --> 57:38.759
I don't have a career.
But, um,

57:38.803 --> 57:41.501
I was an accounts manager,
and actually,

57:41.545 --> 57:44.243
if any of you parents
know anyone that's hiring

57:44.286 --> 57:47.855
or maybe hiring yourselves, I would
love to talk to you after class.

57:50.815 --> 57:54.645
Well, I guess I can
take questions now.

58:00.128 --> 58:02.566
- Yes?
- Why did you get fired?

58:02.609 --> 58:06.526
I was accused of breaking
the department coffee machine.

58:06.570 --> 58:08.006
Yeah.

58:08.049 --> 58:10.965
- Did you do it?
- No.

58:13.794 --> 58:16.275
- Yeah?
- What are you gonna do now?

58:16.318 --> 58:18.103
I don't know.

58:18.146 --> 58:20.366
My dad says you should
only do what you love.

58:20.409 --> 58:22.586
- What does your dad do?
- He's an accountant.

58:22.629 --> 58:25.371
And a liar.
An accountant and a liar.

58:25.414 --> 58:27.373
Any more questions?

58:27.416 --> 58:29.549
Uh, no, no. I think
that's enough for today.

58:29.593 --> 58:32.639
- Thank you, Mr. Crawford.
- Oh, but there's one last thing, one last thing.

58:32.683 --> 58:35.686
The guy who fired me

58:35.729 --> 58:38.210
is standing right there!

58:41.474 --> 58:43.563
Oh, God.

58:43.607 --> 58:45.478
- Wow, really?
- Mm-hmm.

58:45.522 --> 58:48.394
Yeah, you wanna? Okay.
How you doing?

58:48.437 --> 58:50.570
- Who's next?
- I'm next. I'm next.

58:50.614 --> 58:52.659
- We're going alphabetically.
- Well, that's okay.

58:52.703 --> 58:54.269
I don't think we need to go
alphabetically.

58:54.313 --> 58:58.143
- I think I'll go next.
- That would be great.

58:58.186 --> 59:00.449
- Great. Yeah, let him go next.
- You okay with that?

59:00.493 --> 59:02.321
Yeah.

59:02.364 --> 59:04.845
- Let's see what you got.
- Okay, Darius,

59:04.889 --> 59:07.413
why don't you
introduce me?

59:07.456 --> 59:09.589
Where is he? Is he on
a bathroom break or something?

59:09.633 --> 59:11.939
Hey, man, I'm spilling
my guts over here.

59:11.983 --> 59:15.682
What, uh, brings you
up to the roof?

59:17.292 --> 59:18.729
Nothing.

59:20.600 --> 59:23.255
A man does not
go on a roof

59:23.298 --> 59:25.910
in the middle of the day
for no reason.

59:25.953 --> 59:29.914
Even if he is
a very small man.

59:29.957 --> 59:32.046
So what's up?

59:34.571 --> 59:38.096
I guess
I'm just lonely.

59:41.142 --> 59:42.448
Yeah.

59:43.971 --> 59:46.974
I'll introduce myself.
My name is Arthur Schneedy.

59:47.018 --> 59:49.847
I am Darius's father.

59:49.890 --> 59:54.068
I am senior operating officer
at Field Publishing.

59:54.112 --> 59:56.331
My job involves
a lot of travel.

59:56.375 --> 59:59.770
I'm constantly put in situations
where I'm forced to

59:59.813 --> 01:00:02.120
take control of offices

01:00:02.163 --> 01:00:05.427
filled with employees
who don't know me and resent me

01:00:05.471 --> 01:00:08.256
because of my
superior status.

01:00:08.300 --> 01:00:10.998
But I do my job.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:13.914
The moment a problem arises,
I nip it in the bud.

01:00:13.958 --> 01:00:16.177
Just this morning, I...

01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:18.049
I was given
the opportunity

01:00:18.092 --> 01:00:20.878
to show some new employees
how I do business.

01:00:20.921 --> 01:00:24.011
I invited Daniel
into my office to discuss

01:00:24.055 --> 01:00:25.709
a vandalized
coffee machine,

01:00:25.752 --> 01:00:28.537
and he took that opportunity
to let it slip

01:00:28.581 --> 01:00:31.453
that he had been carrying on a--
how do I put it?--

01:00:31.497 --> 01:00:35.936
a series of brisk workouts
in Cupid's gymnasium

01:00:35.980 --> 01:00:38.156
- with his female office assistant.
- This is getting inappropriate!

01:00:38.199 --> 01:00:40.332
I'm sorry,
but I got to finish.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:42.682
- Okay, This is getting inappropriate.
- Hang on one second.

01:00:42.726 --> 01:00:45.685
- Keep it about the career.
- Uh, yeah. This is exactly

01:00:45.729 --> 01:00:47.687
- what I was dealing with at work today.
- They're 6th graders.

01:00:47.731 --> 01:00:49.254
I appreciate that.

01:00:49.297 --> 01:00:53.388
It turned out that Daniel
and his vagabond sausage,

01:00:53.432 --> 01:00:56.478
they were violating
office policy.

01:00:56.522 --> 01:00:59.699
They broke--
everyone in the office

01:00:59.743 --> 01:01:02.310
knows that
he broke rules--

01:01:02.354 --> 01:01:05.183
Everyone in that office knows
that you are a piece of--

01:01:05.226 --> 01:01:08.577
Tread lightly, Daniel.
Tread lightly.

01:01:08.621 --> 01:01:11.319
The last person who called me
that, they got kicked real hard.

01:01:11.363 --> 01:01:12.756
- Okay, boys, that's enough!
- Real hard.

01:01:12.799 --> 01:01:14.279
- You...
- Don't do it.

01:01:14.322 --> 01:01:15.976
- Are a piece...
- Daniel!

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:19.632
- You cannot un-ring that bell.
- of shit!

01:01:25.290 --> 01:01:28.380
- We're going outside!
- Let's go outside.

01:01:28.423 --> 01:01:30.208
Outside!

01:01:44.962 --> 01:01:46.572
- Yeah?
- Yeah, we're gonna do this.

01:01:46.615 --> 01:01:49.444
- Oh, it's time to go!
- Yeah, uh-huh!

01:01:49.488 --> 01:01:51.969
I need to ask you something,
because...

01:01:52.012 --> 01:01:55.015
it would be irresponsible
not to, but...

01:01:55.059 --> 01:01:57.148
you didn't come up here
to jump, did you?

01:01:57.191 --> 01:01:58.758
'Cause if you did,

01:01:58.802 --> 01:02:00.978
I can't let you
go through with it.

01:02:01.021 --> 01:02:03.981
No. I just came up here
to get away.

01:02:04.024 --> 01:02:05.765
Did you?

01:02:07.419 --> 01:02:09.987
I'm gonna make you
my assistant.

01:02:10.030 --> 01:02:12.163
Make you
my little assistant.

01:02:12.206 --> 01:02:15.470
- Here's what I'm gonna do to you.
- I was tracking my steps.

01:02:15.514 --> 01:02:17.168
All right. I'm ready.

01:02:17.211 --> 01:02:18.778
You're going down!

01:02:18.822 --> 01:02:20.649
Come to Daddy.
Come to Daddy.

01:02:20.693 --> 01:02:22.869
- Come on.
- Come on, bro.

01:02:24.218 --> 01:02:26.090
You wanna come?

01:02:26.133 --> 01:02:28.179
You think I don't study
this madness?

01:02:37.318 --> 01:02:38.798
What is going on?

01:02:38.842 --> 01:02:41.453
- The roof!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:02:41.496 --> 01:02:44.064
Uh, uh, call 911!

01:02:48.634 --> 01:02:50.592
What's going on
down there?

01:02:50.636 --> 01:02:51.985
Looks like a fight.

01:02:53.291 --> 01:02:55.510
Looks more like they're dancing.

01:02:58.949 --> 01:03:02.126
- Jesus.
- Who's that?

01:03:02.169 --> 01:03:04.563
It's my mom.
She's worried about me.

01:03:04.606 --> 01:03:06.478
You know how moms
can be, right?

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:08.523
My mom's dead.

01:03:11.004 --> 01:03:13.006
So maybe you don't.

01:03:14.965 --> 01:03:17.010
Come on, Grandpa!

01:03:20.535 --> 01:03:23.712
- When did she die?
- A few years ago.

01:03:23.756 --> 01:03:25.323
You miss her, huh?

01:03:25.366 --> 01:03:27.847
When she was around,
the moving was easier.

01:03:27.891 --> 01:03:30.328
I could handle
everything.

01:03:30.371 --> 01:03:33.070
You're lucky
you still have your mom.

01:03:34.071 --> 01:03:35.463
Yeah.

01:03:36.856 --> 01:03:38.336
Yeah, I guess I am.

01:03:47.171 --> 01:03:49.260
You've gotta be
kidding me.

01:03:49.303 --> 01:03:51.479
You wanna make it real?
You wanna make it real?

01:03:51.523 --> 01:03:54.265
- Yeah!
- Make it real!

01:03:54.308 --> 01:03:56.310
- Real!
- Real!

01:03:57.703 --> 01:04:00.140
- Give me one sec.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:04:00.184 --> 01:04:02.664
I think that's my dad.

01:04:05.015 --> 01:04:07.060
Who, the guy
in the tank top?

01:04:07.104 --> 01:04:08.932
Yeah.

01:04:08.975 --> 01:04:11.021
I hate him.

01:04:11.064 --> 01:04:14.633
Why? 'Cause he beats
people up at your school?

01:04:14.676 --> 01:04:18.245
Because he's always making me move.
I'm always the new kid.

01:04:18.289 --> 01:04:20.639
No one likes
the new kid.

01:04:20.682 --> 01:04:22.771
They all pick on him, shove his
head in toilets, call him names.

01:04:22.815 --> 01:04:25.774
- Being a kid sucks.
- Yes.

01:04:26.863 --> 01:04:29.213
Yes, it does.

01:04:31.041 --> 01:04:33.739
Lady, we're not gonna
pick up the dead guy.

01:04:33.782 --> 01:04:36.655
No, the dead guy
is not the problem.

01:04:36.698 --> 01:04:38.831
That is the problem.

01:04:38.875 --> 01:04:40.572
- Suicide case?
- I don't blame him.

01:04:40.615 --> 01:04:43.401
- Two. Two suicide cases.
- Well, we don't do suicides.

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:46.491
- What?
- We don't do suicides.

01:04:46.534 --> 01:04:49.929
That is police domain.
Just call the cops.

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:52.801
We called 911.
Why do you keep showing up?

01:04:52.845 --> 01:04:55.152
Why do you keep
requesting us?

01:04:55.195 --> 01:04:56.936
911 is not a deejay.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:59.417
You don't
make requests.

01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:02.289
Well, clearly someone's never
worked in emergency services.

01:05:06.250 --> 01:05:08.078
Is this interesting?

01:05:08.121 --> 01:05:10.167
Is this interesting
at all?

01:05:11.472 --> 01:05:13.822
That's my boy up there.

01:05:13.866 --> 01:05:15.389
Darius?

01:05:15.433 --> 01:05:16.913
What's he saying?

01:05:16.956 --> 01:05:18.566
I think
he's shouting my name.

01:05:18.610 --> 01:05:20.525
Your name's Darius?

01:05:20.568 --> 01:05:23.571
- What are you doing up there?
- Like Darius the Great?

01:05:23.615 --> 01:05:25.225
That's what I always
tell people,

01:05:25.269 --> 01:05:27.706
but my parents just found
it in a name book.

01:05:27.749 --> 01:05:29.969
Darius, sweetheart,
what are you doing up there?

01:05:30.013 --> 01:05:32.232
I should
probably go down there.

01:05:32.276 --> 01:05:34.321
- Yeah, you probably should.
- Darius, be careful!

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:37.237
Hey, um, I know
you had a rough day,

01:05:37.281 --> 01:05:41.198
and you don't think anybody
cares about you,

01:05:41.241 --> 01:05:43.504
but I enjoyed talking
with you, and,

01:05:43.548 --> 01:05:46.203
for whatever it's worth,
I care.

01:05:47.291 --> 01:05:49.249
Thanks...
What's your name?

01:05:51.251 --> 01:05:55.560
Uh, well, you're supposed to
call me Mr. McCrow, but...

01:05:55.603 --> 01:05:57.997
but just call me Christian,
all right?

01:05:58.041 --> 01:05:59.694
Thanks, Christian.

01:05:59.738 --> 01:06:01.740
And if you want
my opinion,

01:06:01.783 --> 01:06:04.003
I don't think
you're a failure.

01:06:08.921 --> 01:06:11.141
Hey, Darius.

01:06:11.184 --> 01:06:13.012
Yeah?

01:06:13.056 --> 01:06:15.493
I think I'm gonna
come with you.

01:06:17.669 --> 01:06:21.238
He's leaving!
He's not gonna jump!

01:06:54.532 --> 01:06:56.186
Christian!

01:07:13.072 --> 01:07:15.379
That was pretty scary.

01:07:23.691 --> 01:07:25.606
I won.

♪ Do you know when
You were already gone ♪

01:07:28.044 --> 01:07:30.263
Don't move.
The paramedics are coming.

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:34.572
- They're on their way.
- It's a miracle!

01:07:34.615 --> 01:07:37.314
That has to be,
like, 30 feet!

01:07:37.357 --> 01:07:39.055
Sir?

01:07:39.098 --> 01:07:40.926
Sir, can you hear me?

01:07:40.969 --> 01:07:42.884
Can you tell me your name,
please?

01:07:42.928 --> 01:07:45.278
It's Christian.

01:07:45.322 --> 01:07:47.063
- Any dilation?
- Yep.

01:07:47.106 --> 01:07:49.456
Pulse? Okay.

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:51.937
Sir, I'm gonna put some oxygen on.
Just breathe normally, please.

01:07:51.980 --> 01:07:54.505
- All right, on my count--
- Christian!

01:07:55.593 --> 01:07:57.160
Hey.

01:07:57.203 --> 01:08:00.206
Good move
leaving the roof.

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:02.556
Are you gonna be okay?

01:08:02.600 --> 01:08:06.778
You should tell your dad
what you told me.

01:08:16.265 --> 01:08:18.832
What the hell were you
doing up there?

01:08:18.877 --> 01:08:21.009
I don't know.

01:08:21.053 --> 01:08:23.751
What were you doing
up on the roof?

01:08:23.795 --> 01:08:27.667
I don't want to move anymore.
I just don't want to move.

01:08:29.017 --> 01:08:30.845
I love you, buddy.

01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:39.202
Patricia...

01:08:39.245 --> 01:08:40.768
How could you
do that?

01:08:40.812 --> 01:08:42.944
How could you just
come in here and...

01:08:42.988 --> 01:08:46.513
Dad, do you know
how hard

01:08:46.557 --> 01:08:49.341
I've been trying to keep
the two of us together?

01:08:49.386 --> 01:08:52.215
- To keep us--
- Yes, I do.

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:54.260
And I behaved
like a real jerk.

01:08:54.304 --> 01:08:57.045
And I'd be upset too
if my dad

01:08:57.089 --> 01:08:58.917
showed up at school
and got into a fight.

01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.701
It's not that.

01:09:00.745 --> 01:09:03.269
You and I are supposed
to be a team.

01:09:03.313 --> 01:09:05.576
Especially
now that Mom's gone.

01:09:05.618 --> 01:09:07.317
You should've
told me first.

01:09:07.359 --> 01:09:10.885
I deserved to know
before the rest of my class.

01:09:10.929 --> 01:09:13.192
- You're right.
- And if you would've told me first,

01:09:13.236 --> 01:09:15.716
I would've been
able to say

01:09:15.760 --> 01:09:18.937
that we would be okay, and that
you would get another job,

01:09:18.979 --> 01:09:21.809
and we'll
make it through.

01:09:21.853 --> 01:09:23.942
That's not your job.

01:09:23.984 --> 01:09:25.987
It's not your job, okay?

01:09:29.426 --> 01:09:31.776
I love you.

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:35.171
I'm sure glad
you take after Mom.

01:09:35.214 --> 01:09:36.868
Yeah, me too.

01:09:43.265 --> 01:09:45.529

01:09:45.572 --> 01:09:48.401
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I am.

01:09:48.444 --> 01:09:51.535
Dad, this is
my new friend, Darius.

01:09:51.578 --> 01:09:54.538
- Nice to meet you, Darius.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

01:09:54.581 --> 01:09:56.409
Actually,

01:09:56.453 --> 01:09:58.890
Darius and I have
a lot in common.

01:10:00.021 --> 01:10:01.762
His mom died too.

01:10:03.329 --> 01:10:05.113
I'm very sorry
to hear that.

01:10:07.768 --> 01:10:09.857
See you at school
tomorrow?

01:10:09.901 --> 01:10:11.511
Take it easy.

01:10:11.555 --> 01:10:13.948

Daniel.

01:10:43.326 --> 01:10:45.589
Bob?

01:10:45.632 --> 01:10:48.505
So sorry I had to keep
rescheduling today.

01:10:48.548 --> 01:10:50.333
I got, uh, fucking
cock-rammed

01:10:50.376 --> 01:10:52.117
with a whole series
of meetings this afternoon.

01:10:52.160 --> 01:10:54.598
- You want to order something?
- No, I'm good.

01:10:54.641 --> 01:10:58.297
You sure? Coffee, tea, anything like that?
This place is great.

01:10:58.341 --> 01:11:01.344
No, my daughter's in the car waiting,
so I kind of want to make this quick.

01:11:04.912 --> 01:11:07.045
- Smart.
- What's smart?

01:11:07.088 --> 01:11:09.439
Bringing your daughter along so I
don't beat the shit out of you.

01:11:09.482 --> 01:11:12.485
- That's not why she's here--
- It's fine.

01:11:12.529 --> 01:11:15.271
Come on.
Follow me.

01:11:21.973 --> 01:11:23.583
Watch your head.

01:11:26.978 --> 01:11:28.936
The bathroom?

01:11:28.980 --> 01:11:30.590
The bathroom.

01:11:43.429 --> 01:11:44.822
All right.

01:11:44.865 --> 01:11:47.128
Pull out your cock.

01:11:47.172 --> 01:11:48.695
What?

01:11:48.739 --> 01:11:50.741
I told you, Daniel,
I need to compare.

01:11:50.784 --> 01:11:54.048
Healthy or not, I need to compare.
It's human nature.

01:11:54.092 --> 01:11:56.660
I need to compare our height,
our weight, our hair color,

01:11:56.703 --> 01:11:59.967
the way we pronounce certain
multisyllabic words.

01:12:00.011 --> 01:12:03.188
By the way, could you say,
"antidisestablishmentarianism?"

01:12:03.231 --> 01:12:06.060
Antidisestablishmentarianism.

01:12:06.104 --> 01:12:08.933
Hmm. Interesting.

01:12:08.976 --> 01:12:11.370
Anyway,
I need to compare.

01:12:11.414 --> 01:12:14.591
And of all the things I need to compare,
the cock is the most important.

01:12:14.634 --> 01:12:17.028
It's the part of you
that committed the act.

01:12:17.071 --> 01:12:18.682
Look, I don't feel
comfortable

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:20.771
pulling out my cock
in front of you.

01:12:20.814 --> 01:12:24.470
And I'm not comfortable knowing
you put your cock in my wife!

01:12:24.514 --> 01:12:27.778
But I have to deal with it.
Now, pull it out!

01:12:44.229 --> 01:12:46.362
What are you doing?

01:12:46.405 --> 01:12:48.581
You know what, Bob?

01:12:48.625 --> 01:12:51.018
I've had a hell
of a day today.

01:12:51.062 --> 01:12:53.194
A hell of a day.

01:12:53.238 --> 01:12:56.154
And I'm sorry what happened
with Nadine. I really am.

01:12:56.197 --> 01:12:58.548
But life's too short
to waste time comparing cocks

01:12:58.591 --> 01:13:01.028
with strangers
in coffee shop bathrooms.

01:13:01.072 --> 01:13:04.510
My daughter's in the car waiting.
I'm gonna leave now.

01:13:04.554 --> 01:13:07.165
Well, I'm gonna take your
unwillingness to pull out your cock

01:13:07.208 --> 01:13:09.472
as a sign that
you have a tiny penis.

01:13:09.515 --> 01:13:11.430
You can read it
any way you like.

01:13:11.474 --> 01:13:13.650
Okay, I will.

01:13:13.693 --> 01:13:15.391
You still want to
kick my ass?

01:13:15.434 --> 01:13:17.131
No.

01:13:17.175 --> 01:13:19.743
Nadine told me about
what happened today.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:21.571
Her lying about
the coffee machine,

01:13:21.614 --> 01:13:24.443
you getting fired
and all that.

01:13:24.487 --> 01:13:28.186
- Looks like you've had enough for one day.
- That's kind of you to say.

01:13:28.229 --> 01:13:30.406
Yeah, well I'm consoled
by the fact

01:13:30.449 --> 01:13:33.191
that your penis
is unquestionably tiny.

01:13:33.234 --> 01:13:35.454
You're free to go.

01:13:35.498 --> 01:13:38.631
- Good to meet you, Daniel.
- You too, Bob.

01:13:41.765 --> 01:13:45.246
- What is that, an Indian burn?
- Apache-style!

01:13:48.946 --> 01:13:50.513
Ha!

01:13:55.518 --> 01:13:57.433
Ow!

01:14:03.134 --> 01:14:05.571
Oh, my God.
What happened to your arm?

01:14:05.615 --> 01:14:07.660
This dude gave me
an Indian burn.

01:14:07.704 --> 01:14:10.489
An Indian burn?
I didn't know adults did that.

01:14:10.533 --> 01:14:12.317
Well, neither did I.

01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:14.798
Well, are you
gonna be okay?

01:14:15.929 --> 01:14:18.105
Yeah, I think I am.

01:14:19.063 --> 01:14:20.456
