WEBVTT

00:05.673 --> 00:07.206
You wanted to see me,
Baxter?

00:07.208 --> 00:08.607
No. I want to talk to you.
Mm-hmm.

00:08.609 --> 00:11.043
Seeing you is
an unfortunate by-product.

00:12.446 --> 00:14.213
Mnh-mnh.
Look at this.

00:14.215 --> 00:18.884
Oh, no. Somebody bwoke
your wittle twuck.

00:18.886 --> 00:20.486
It's a tank.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.855
And if it weren't for the
M4 Sherman tank... Mm-hmm.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.823
...instead of
speaking baby talk,

00:24.825 --> 00:26.759
you'd be
<i> sprechen sie Deutsc!</i>

00:28.295 --> 00:30.062
What do we want to do
about this?

00:30.064 --> 00:32.831
Well, I recommend a two-pronged attack.
All right.

00:32.833 --> 00:36.335
Okay, number one --
try to grow up.

00:36.337 --> 00:38.670
Number two --
when that proves impossible,

00:38.672 --> 00:40.172
leave your toys at home.

00:40.174 --> 00:42.074
I've seen your desk.
Yeah.

00:42.076 --> 00:44.410
You got all
the Jackson bobbleheads.

00:44.412 --> 00:47.813
Mm, I'm not really seeing
the connection there.

00:47.815 --> 00:49.581
Why don't we get back to
the crime of the century?

00:49.583 --> 00:52.184
This isn't the first time
this happened, right? Mm-hmm.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.254
Somebody is coming here at night
and playing with my stuff,

00:55.256 --> 00:58.257
right under the watchful eyes
of your crack security team.

00:58.259 --> 00:59.658
All right, so what do you
want me to do,

00:59.660 --> 01:01.660
uh, station a guy
in your office

01:01.662 --> 01:03.462
to make sure your toys
don't get broken?

01:04.765 --> 01:07.032
You want me to station a guy
in your office

01:07.034 --> 01:09.201
to make sure
your toys don't get broken.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.103
This is custom-made stuff.
Uh-huh.

01:11.105 --> 01:12.337
The track is broken.

01:12.339 --> 01:13.872
I got to custom order this,
right?

01:13.874 --> 01:16.875
Which means
this Sherman tank is out.

01:16.877 --> 01:21.780
Which means my left flank is
now open and tiny Hitler wins.

01:21.782 --> 01:24.550
Can you see
tiny Hitler, Mike?

01:24.552 --> 01:27.052
(whispers)
Is he in the room with us?

01:27.054 --> 01:29.455
Mock me if you want...
and get fired.

01:29.457 --> 01:30.689
(laughs)

01:30.691 --> 01:32.291
Help me with this.

01:32.293 --> 01:34.093
All right. Okay. Okay.
I'll do something about it.

01:34.095 --> 01:35.761
Tonight I'll bring in
my best man.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.096
Thank you.
Yeah.

01:37.098 --> 01:38.964
Jermaine Jackson. Yeah.

01:38.966 --> 01:40.432
N-Nothing gets past
Jermaine.

01:40.434 --> 01:42.101
He's like...

01:42.103 --> 01:44.103
(laughs)

01:47.041 --> 01:50.142
-- Captions by VITAC --

01:53.914 --> 01:55.881
Hey.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.250
Wow.
Old wrinkly sweats.

01:58.252 --> 02:02.054
Honey, if you've officially
given up, I'm having more bacon.

02:02.056 --> 02:04.089
I am wearing these
because I<i> haven't</i> given up.

02:04.091 --> 02:05.757
I'm going out
to get some exercise.

02:05.759 --> 02:06.825
Well, good for you.

02:06.827 --> 02:09.161
I still want more bacon.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.562
I'm going power walking.

02:10.564 --> 02:12.397
Helen Potts is stopping by
to pick me up.

02:12.399 --> 02:15.667
Oh, great.
Helen Potts is coming over.

02:15.669 --> 02:17.769
My legs want to run,
but there's more bacon,

02:17.771 --> 02:20.139
so my stomach
wants to stay.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.574
I'm literally
tearing myself apart over this.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.910
Come on. She's nice.

02:24.912 --> 02:26.245
And, you know,
I give her a lot of credit.

02:26.247 --> 02:28.013
She's getting out there,

02:28.015 --> 02:30.516
trying to put her life back
together after Tom's passing.

02:30.518 --> 02:33.085
It's been two years
since he faked his death, right?

02:33.087 --> 02:35.020
Hey!

02:35.022 --> 02:38.090
Either way,
he's in a better place.

02:38.092 --> 02:39.691
You know,
you can't fool me.

02:39.693 --> 02:41.260
You like Helen.
I do.

02:41.262 --> 02:43.028
If you didn't, not even bacon
could keep you here.

02:43.030 --> 02:46.198
Never underestimate
the power of pork.

02:46.200 --> 02:47.699
You wouldn't talk
like that

02:47.701 --> 02:49.268
if you heard the nice things
she says about you.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.269
Yeah?

02:50.271 --> 02:51.303
You don't know.

02:51.305 --> 02:52.271
Hey, Helen.

02:52.273 --> 02:54.006
Hey, Vanessa.

03:00.214 --> 03:01.380
(sighs)

03:01.382 --> 03:03.448
Hi, Mike.
Good morning.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.217
Do you know
that you're the reason

03:05.219 --> 03:07.286
that we always start the
power walk over here? Really?

03:07.288 --> 03:10.289
Yeah, I see you, and I want
to get away as fast as I can.

03:10.291 --> 03:13.058
You're right, honey.
She does love me.

03:13.060 --> 03:16.795
Well, I wouldn't go that far --
<i> ever.</i>

03:16.797 --> 03:18.964
But, uh, I-I did
bring you this.

03:18.966 --> 03:20.165
Yeah?

03:20.167 --> 03:21.833
Oh.
Looks like a nice jacket.

03:21.835 --> 03:23.835
Oh.
Looks good.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.204
It fits!

03:25.206 --> 03:27.573
Beautiful, and I like it.
Thank you very much.

03:27.575 --> 03:29.708
Yeah, I just couldn't let it
be buried with Tom.

03:32.079 --> 03:34.146
Even though it looked great
on him in the coffin.

03:34.148 --> 03:36.014
(groans)

03:36.016 --> 03:37.816
Great --
a dead guy's coat.

03:37.818 --> 03:40.018
Nice, thanks.

03:40.020 --> 03:42.321
I'm clearing out
all of Tom's stuff.

03:42.323 --> 03:43.989
You know, I'm trying to move on
with my life,

03:43.991 --> 03:46.592
but it's<i> hard</i> with
all of his things in the house.

03:46.594 --> 03:48.427
Yeah.
I understand what you mean.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.362
I mean, nobody believes me
when I say this,

03:50.364 --> 03:52.831
but it'll be hard for me
when Mike passes.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.500
Would you like some cheese
on your bacon?

03:55.502 --> 03:56.902
(laughs)

03:56.904 --> 03:58.403
It's nice to hear
that you're moving on.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.938
You know, getting out,
maybe meet a guy.

03:59.940 --> 04:01.106
You know,
get back on the market.

04:01.108 --> 04:03.041
Real nice, Mike.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.310
Made me feel like
a fresh slab of meat.

04:06.714 --> 04:08.380
No one said "fresh."

04:08.382 --> 04:10.282
(laughs)

04:10.284 --> 04:12.417
You know, you always
make me feel better

04:12.419 --> 04:14.286
about not having a man
in my life.

04:14.288 --> 04:17.022
Yeah? Not exactly up to you,
now is it?

04:17.024 --> 04:18.557
Okay! Okay!

04:18.559 --> 04:21.693
Ding! Ding!
Round's over.

04:21.695 --> 04:25.030
You know, I just don't know
if I'm ready to date.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.467
You know, I'm trying
to take this moving-on thing

04:28.469 --> 04:29.701
one step at a time,
but...

04:29.703 --> 04:31.303
(sighs)

04:31.305 --> 04:34.206
...there is something
that I could use your help with.

04:34.208 --> 04:35.641
Everything is gone

04:35.643 --> 04:37.409
except for Tom's hobby stuff
in the basement,

04:37.411 --> 04:38.977
and that -- I just --

04:38.979 --> 04:40.579
I can't be there
when the buyer comes to get it.

04:40.581 --> 04:41.580
Would you do it?

04:41.582 --> 04:42.981
We'd be happy to.
Yeah.

04:42.983 --> 04:44.883
Hold on a second.

04:44.885 --> 04:47.419
Meeting strangers
in her basement

04:47.421 --> 04:49.521
while she has an alibi.

04:50.924 --> 04:52.758
This is gonna end up
on Netflix.

04:52.760 --> 04:54.893
(both laugh)

04:58.966 --> 05:00.966
Kyle, we have a disaster
at the restaurant.

05:00.968 --> 05:02.501
Go find Kristin, please.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.703
Yes, sir.
Here she is.

05:06.240 --> 05:07.572
Good work, son.

05:07.574 --> 05:08.840
We're turning this thing around
already.

05:08.842 --> 05:10.242
What's this about?

05:10.244 --> 05:11.176
Yelp.

05:11.178 --> 05:14.079
Okay. Yipes!

05:14.081 --> 05:15.514
What's this about?

05:15.516 --> 05:17.783
No, uh, I think
he's talking about Yelp,

05:17.785 --> 05:20.452
the -- the website
where customers write reviews.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.621
And the Outdoor Man Grill
just got a terrible one

05:22.623 --> 05:25.190
by someone
who goes by Bubba X.

05:25.192 --> 05:27.459
Oh, no.
That's our target demographic --

05:27.461 --> 05:29.795
a hillbilly Muslim.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.096
I'm serious, Kristin.

05:31.098 --> 05:32.331
A lot of people
read these things,

05:32.333 --> 05:33.832
and this could
hurt our business.

05:33.834 --> 05:36.101
Oh, okay, well, did he say
who he had a problem with?

05:36.103 --> 05:37.602
I-I'll just talk to him.

05:37.604 --> 05:39.271
No, I don't think
you're the person to do that.

05:39.273 --> 05:40.706
Listen to this --

05:40.708 --> 05:42.441
"My dining experience
at Outdoor Man Grill

05:42.443 --> 05:44.509
made me envy
the braised ostrich

05:44.511 --> 05:46.211
who didn't
have to sit through it.

05:46.213 --> 05:49.614
Manager Kristin Baxter
was dismissive and inattentive.

05:49.616 --> 05:50.882
She was such a shrew,

05:50.884 --> 05:52.951
I'm surprised
she wasn't on the menu."

05:54.054 --> 05:55.354
"Zero stars."

05:55.356 --> 05:57.289
Yipes.

05:59.526 --> 06:03.228
Ed, uh, you know
how well I treat our customers.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.563
This just sounds
like somebody

06:04.565 --> 06:05.997
who's -- who's
trying to get a free meal.

06:05.999 --> 06:07.332
Well, it worked.

06:07.334 --> 06:08.467
That's exactly
what you're gonna do.

06:08.469 --> 06:09.968
You're gonna
invite him back.

06:09.970 --> 06:11.536
Okay. Okay.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.338
And I will be sure to turn on
the Kristin Baxter charm.

06:13.340 --> 06:15.440
Excellent.
Let's see that smile.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.711
You know what? Give him
some free calamari, too.

06:24.885 --> 06:28.320
I really appreciate you handling
this sale for me, guys.

06:28.322 --> 06:30.155
Of course, Helen.

06:30.157 --> 06:32.224
We understand how difficult it
is to part with such memories.

06:32.226 --> 06:37.095
Man, Tom built himself
quite the man cave.

06:37.097 --> 06:40.399
Looks like he was really trying
to get away from something.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.367
What was Tom's hobby?

06:42.369 --> 06:43.769
War.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.538
Yeah, yeah.
I had boxes of these tanks.

06:46.540 --> 06:48.173
Got all sorts of tanks
in there --

06:48.175 --> 06:50.208
artillery pieces,
he's got the big Tiger II,

06:50.210 --> 06:52.277
an M5 Stuart.

06:52.279 --> 06:57.048
This is like Easter
and I found all the eggs!

06:57.050 --> 06:59.217
These are all the tanks
from the Battle of the Bulge.

06:59.219 --> 07:00.552
That was Tom's favorite.

07:00.554 --> 07:02.087
Yeah, but for tanks battles
it's Kursk.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.422
That was the battle.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.525
But for pure mayhem,
you got to love the Bulge.

07:06.527 --> 07:09.027
Well, every year on
the anniversary of the battle --

07:09.029 --> 07:11.463
December 16th
through January 25th.

07:11.465 --> 07:13.298
I'm impressed.

07:13.300 --> 07:17.803
I will give you $500 if you can
tell me when our anniversary is.

07:17.805 --> 07:20.439
She's
a public-school teacher.

07:20.441 --> 07:22.474
She doesn't have $500.

07:23.710 --> 07:27.913
Anyway, Tom would, like,
re-enact the whole battle.

07:27.915 --> 07:29.648
You know, on the 16th,

07:29.650 --> 07:31.249
he would come down here
in the morning --

07:31.251 --> 07:33.885
That's when the Germans
attacked, those sneaky bastards.

07:33.887 --> 07:38.323
And he would lay everything
out on this.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.759
Wow. Wow.

07:40.761 --> 07:41.927
Do you know what this is,
Vanessa?

07:41.929 --> 07:43.595
This is
the entire battlefield.

07:43.597 --> 07:44.896
That's it?

07:44.898 --> 07:48.133
Then why did World War II
take so long?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.902
So, he built all this,
and he built these tanks?

07:50.904 --> 07:51.970
Oh, yeah.

07:51.972 --> 07:53.738
He'd position
all the tanks,

07:53.740 --> 07:56.908
and then every day,
he'd move these markers around

07:56.910 --> 07:59.411
exactly the way
the battle unfolded.

07:59.413 --> 08:00.812
Does he have
any more of these tanks?

08:00.814 --> 08:02.147
Oh, tons.
(sighs)

08:02.149 --> 08:04.115
These grown men
and their toy tanks.

08:04.117 --> 08:05.917
You know, sometimes
it seems like

08:05.919 --> 08:07.652
you and I married
the same man.

08:10.457 --> 08:12.591
You know,
the kids and I always wanted

08:12.593 --> 08:14.459
Tom to explain
this battle to us,

08:14.461 --> 08:16.194
but we never
got around to it.

08:16.196 --> 08:17.362
Yeah.

08:17.364 --> 08:19.264
Sounds pretty emotional
for you.

08:19.266 --> 08:22.200
Tell you what, why don't we just
move all this stuff to my house

08:22.202 --> 08:23.668
and I'll sell
all the tanks from there?

08:23.670 --> 08:25.437
You know, or whatever.

08:25.439 --> 08:27.606
I'm sorry.
I can't do that.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.374
I've already sold them.
Oh.

08:29.376 --> 08:31.343
And the buyer's
on the way.

08:31.345 --> 08:33.778
A deal's a deal.
I'm so sorry.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.780
Yeah. A deal's a deal,
that's for sure.

08:35.782 --> 08:37.215
No kidding.

08:37.217 --> 08:40.619
You got to honor that --
I'm gonna get these tanks.

08:40.621 --> 08:42.354
She said no.

08:42.356 --> 08:45.123
Somebody -- Hey,
somebody already bought them.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.725
Face it --
you can't have these.

08:46.727 --> 08:49.828
I've never wanted anything more
in my entire life

08:49.830 --> 08:52.330
than these tanks.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.833
That's what you said about me
30 years ago.

08:54.835 --> 08:56.167
I already got you.

08:56.169 --> 08:58.904
Now I've moved on
to something else.

09:05.312 --> 09:08.079
Thanks again, Mike,
for all your help.

09:08.081 --> 09:12.384
You and Vanessa have been so
supportive through all of this.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.520
Well, Vanessa has.

09:15.522 --> 09:18.390
Well, that's the yin and
the yang of our relationship.

09:18.392 --> 09:22.027
She does good things,
I am yang.

09:22.029 --> 09:24.162
Mike, Helen, the, uh --
the buyer's here.

09:24.164 --> 09:27.232
Oh, hey.

09:27.234 --> 09:28.900
Hi. Hi.

09:31.872 --> 09:33.238
This is Teresa.

09:33.240 --> 09:35.674
And I am so excited
about these tanks.

09:35.676 --> 09:37.342
(voice breaking)
Well, I'm -- I'm just glad

09:37.344 --> 09:38.710
that they're gonna go
to somebody

09:38.712 --> 09:40.211
who will love them
as much as Tom did.

09:40.213 --> 09:42.080
Hey, hey, hey.
No tears.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.348
Come on, let's get you
out of here

09:43.350 --> 09:44.382
before you change
your mind.

09:44.384 --> 09:47.118
Yeah. Hmm.

09:47.120 --> 09:49.220
Okay. Uh, so you're gonna buy
all these tanks. Mm-hmm.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.722
First up,
I should tell you

09:50.724 --> 09:54.292
that there's a lot lead paint
involved in these,

09:54.294 --> 09:57.696
so if your kids were to put them
in their mouths,

09:57.698 --> 10:01.032
their test scores
will go right into the toilet.

10:01.034 --> 10:02.867
I'm actually
buying them for me.

10:02.869 --> 10:05.370
But, you know, I-I'll take note
of what you said, there.

10:05.372 --> 10:08.640
That's some really great ad--
great advice.

10:08.642 --> 10:12.644
"Don't...eat...them."

10:17.618 --> 10:19.150
All these tanks
are for you?

10:19.152 --> 10:21.252
Yeah.
Of course they are.

10:21.254 --> 10:23.221
Well, it's just that a woman
of your poise and elegance,

10:23.223 --> 10:25.957
playing with toy tanks
seems kind of goofy.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.159
Oh, well, actually,
I commanded

10:28.161 --> 10:30.428
a tank maintenance unit
in Iraq.

10:30.430 --> 10:32.731
I can take a tank apart
and put it back together

10:32.733 --> 10:34.099
in a sandstorm.

10:34.101 --> 10:38.336
Well, doesn't sound
so goofy now, does it?

10:38.338 --> 10:39.671
You know,

10:39.673 --> 10:42.273
I kind of get
the impression that, uh...

10:42.275 --> 10:43.408
you don't want me
to buy these.

10:43.410 --> 10:46.911
Yes.
No. I don't.

10:46.913 --> 10:48.847
Is it something to do
with Helen?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.749
She seems like she doesn't
want to sell them,

10:50.751 --> 10:52.450
that she's still attached to them.
Yeah, you noticed that.

10:52.452 --> 10:54.352
That's -- That's why
you're good around tanks.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.788
You understand that under the steel
plates, there's a beating heart.

10:56.790 --> 10:58.289
Mm.

10:58.291 --> 11:00.525
So why is she doing this?

11:00.527 --> 11:04.796
Well, that -- that other
woman with her...  Yes?

11:04.798 --> 11:07.599
...with the hair
and the teeth is...

11:07.601 --> 11:09.701
is her v-very mean sister.

11:10.971 --> 11:14.272
And she, uh,
didn't like Tom, the husband,

11:14.274 --> 11:16.107
and so she's making Helen

11:16.109 --> 11:19.611
get rid of everything
that reminded her of that.

11:19.613 --> 11:20.879
Are you serious?
Yeah.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.180
Serious. Oh, yeah.

11:22.182 --> 11:24.482
Well, you saw
she was getting out of here,

11:24.484 --> 11:25.750
she even said,
"Don't cry!"

11:26.787 --> 11:28.853
'Cause, you know,
she doesn't want her to cry,

11:28.855 --> 11:31.456
even shed a tear
for the poor old guy.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.892
That's --
That's horrible.

11:33.894 --> 11:36.728
Ah, she's awful!

11:36.730 --> 11:40.231
Nothing -- Nothing would make
sweet Helen happier

11:40.233 --> 11:43.501
than -- Mm --
coming down here

11:43.503 --> 11:46.671
and seeing these tanks
exactly the way

11:46.673 --> 11:48.907
old big Tom left them.

11:52.179 --> 11:55.647
You know, I -- I can't take them
from that poor woman.

11:55.649 --> 11:57.982
Of course you can't.
No, you can't.

11:57.984 --> 11:59.751
So, I wouldn't --
I wouldn't blame you.

11:59.753 --> 12:01.720
Oh, gosh.
That's a good choice.

12:01.722 --> 12:03.655
You know, here's what I think -- we
should keep it between us...  Okay.

12:03.657 --> 12:07.158
...'cause you don't want to get
on the bad side of that sister.

12:07.160 --> 12:09.894
Boy, she --
she's a badger.

12:11.698 --> 12:13.631
Lemonade?

12:16.036 --> 12:18.369
No, thank you.
I was just leaving.

12:18.371 --> 12:20.105
Uh, what --
what about your tanks?

12:20.107 --> 12:21.906
Ah, don't you mean
<i> Tom's</i> tanks?

12:21.908 --> 12:24.342
They're staying here,
right where they belong!

12:32.185 --> 12:33.785
What did I do?

12:33.787 --> 12:37.222
Honey, sometimes things
aren't all about you.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.124
(Sighs)

12:39.126 --> 12:41.526
But now that we've removed
the obstacle,

12:41.528 --> 12:44.095
I'm ready
to accept my reward.

12:45.532 --> 12:47.799
What happened?
Oh.

12:47.801 --> 12:50.201
T-Teresa changed her mind.

12:50.203 --> 12:53.104
And then she said
she'd pray for me.

12:53.106 --> 12:55.707
People!
People are nuts!

12:55.709 --> 12:57.776
Listen,
here's what I'm gonna do.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.477
How about I buy
all the tanks?

12:59.479 --> 13:01.579
Whatever she was gonna pay you,
I'll add 10%,

13:01.581 --> 13:04.949
<i> and</i> I will pray for yo.

13:08.755 --> 13:10.722
Thanks, Mike.
Yeah.

13:10.724 --> 13:12.991
You're a good friend.
Yeah.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.695
Yes.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.734
Seriously?

13:22.736 --> 13:24.402
S-- You are gonna --
Hey, look at me.

13:24.404 --> 13:26.237
Look at me!

13:26.239 --> 13:27.972
You are gonna let
that poor woman

13:27.974 --> 13:29.908
think you are doing this
out the kindness of your heart?

13:29.910 --> 13:33.077
She's grieving right now.
She needs a hero.  What?

13:40.420 --> 13:41.586
Kristin.
Hmm?

13:41.588 --> 13:43.621
Is Bubba X here?
Oh, any minute,

13:43.623 --> 13:45.990
and I promise he will have
a great experience.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.358
Excellent.

13:47.360 --> 13:49.627
Oh, and, when you shake hands
with him...

13:49.629 --> 13:51.129
lighten up, all right?

13:51.131 --> 13:53.932
'Cause you've got a real
East German thing going on.

13:56.102 --> 13:57.101
(clears throat)

13:57.103 --> 13:58.369
Hey, Eve.

13:58.371 --> 13:59.771
Uh, I don't really have
time to talk.

13:59.773 --> 14:00.939
I-I'm expecting someone.

14:00.941 --> 14:02.607
You're expecting me.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.609
Bubba X, party of one.

14:04.611 --> 14:06.845
You're Bubba X?

14:06.847 --> 14:09.147
Well, my friends
call me "Bubba."

14:09.149 --> 14:10.982
Hi, Bubba!

14:10.984 --> 14:12.450
Can we all
pick new names?

14:12.452 --> 14:14.953
Oh, can I be "Hootie"?

14:14.955 --> 14:17.722
Eve, did you think
that that review was funny?

14:17.724 --> 14:19.357
Uh, a little.

14:19.359 --> 14:22.227
That part about you being
a mole person was hilarious.

14:22.229 --> 14:25.396
It was a shrew.
And I am not one.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.131
I don't know why
you wouldn't want to be.

14:27.133 --> 14:28.800
They can see in the dark.

14:28.802 --> 14:30.535
Could you get back to work,
please?

14:30.537 --> 14:32.203
(laughs)
Hootie out.

14:32.205 --> 14:33.838
All right,
you know what, Kris?

14:33.840 --> 14:36.808
My review
was mostly honest.

14:36.810 --> 14:38.643
What are you
talking about?

14:38.645 --> 14:40.511
Uh, when Cammy and I
came in last week,

14:40.513 --> 14:42.046
you treated me like crap.
What?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.548
I have never treated
a customer

14:43.550 --> 14:45.316
with anything
but the upmost respect.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.218
I know, but you didn't treat me
like a customer.

14:47.220 --> 14:48.853
You treated me
like your little sister.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.321
What does that mean?

14:50.323 --> 14:51.990
You stuck me in the corner
by the kitchen.

14:51.992 --> 14:54.158
It was like being put at
the kid's table at Thanksgiving

14:54.160 --> 14:56.094
but without the food.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.429
I-I don't know
if you've noticed, Kristin,

14:58.431 --> 14:59.864
but I-I'm an adult now.

14:59.866 --> 15:01.666
Then act like one.

15:01.668 --> 15:03.201
If an adult was having
a bad experience,

15:03.203 --> 15:04.702
they would speak
with the manager, okay?

15:04.704 --> 15:07.739
Not post a bogus review
that could hurt my business.

15:07.741 --> 15:09.073
Uh, "bogus"?

15:09.075 --> 15:10.675
You made me wait,
I got a bad table,

15:10.677 --> 15:12.210
and you even
gave our candle

15:12.212 --> 15:14.245
to an old man
who couldn't read his menu.

15:14.247 --> 15:16.948
So, what do you say we get this
started with some calamari,

15:16.950 --> 15:20.184
rings only, pick out the gross
ones with the tiny legs, okay?

15:20.186 --> 15:23.354
(Laughs) Or we could start
you off with a big fat "no,"

15:23.356 --> 15:26.424
followed by the door
and the parking lot.

15:26.426 --> 15:29.360
Okay. Well, I just might
have to update my review then.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.129
Oh, knock yourself out.

15:31.131 --> 15:33.464
Oh, and, hey, let me know
if you need any help with that.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.236
Hey, you.

15:38.238 --> 15:40.972
Uh, honey, I prefer
when I'm in front of my troops

15:40.974 --> 15:43.541
you call me "General."

15:43.543 --> 15:45.310
Can I ask you something?

15:45.312 --> 15:47.211
What is it
with you and tanks?

15:48.114 --> 15:50.415
Oh, uh, General.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.417
It's a big metal machine
with a huge gun.

15:52.419 --> 15:54.152
What's the mystery?

15:54.154 --> 15:56.054
It was my Grandpa Jack.
Oh.

15:56.056 --> 15:57.889
He got me involved
with this stuff.

15:57.891 --> 16:00.425
Yeah, he made these -- these
little models, too? (groans)

16:00.427 --> 16:02.327
(chuckles)

16:02.329 --> 16:04.062
His tanks
were a little bit bigger --

16:04.064 --> 16:07.098
19 feet long,
66,000 pounds.

16:07.100 --> 16:08.733
He<i> made</i> tanks?
Yes, he did.

16:08.735 --> 16:10.101
Wow.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.302
Gosh, I always thought
he worked for Chrysler.

16:11.304 --> 16:12.637
Well, he did,
but during the war,

16:12.639 --> 16:14.172
Chrysler, along with
the other car companies,

16:14.174 --> 16:15.740
stopped making cars
and started making stuff,

16:15.742 --> 16:17.342
including tanks.
Hmm.

16:17.344 --> 16:20.144
I bet that's why the cars
in the '50s were so damn big.

16:20.146 --> 16:23.581
(laughs) 'Cause the...

16:23.583 --> 16:25.516
He got me this kit. It was just
like this -- a Sherman tank.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.285
I had to build it, he wouldn't
help, 'cause he said,

16:27.287 --> 16:29.620
"I do enough of that stuff
at work."

16:29.622 --> 16:33.424
So tanks were your
connection to him. Yeah.

16:33.426 --> 16:35.626
Kind of feels like he's sitting
right here with us,

16:35.628 --> 16:37.695
although he'd be right there,
going, "Cronkite?

16:37.697 --> 16:39.630
He's a pinko."

16:39.632 --> 16:41.632
(chuckles)
Yeah. Yeah.

16:41.634 --> 16:44.702
I guess, uh, that's
what it's like for Helen, too.

16:44.704 --> 16:46.604
You know,
tanks and Tom --

16:46.606 --> 16:49.607
these are all just part
of one nice memory.

16:49.609 --> 16:52.110
I bet that's why it was so hard for
her to let them go. (chuckles)

16:52.112 --> 16:54.979
But, you know, I mean, at least
you got what you wanted.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.415
So you enjoy.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.052
General.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.121
Oh, I-I will.

17:03.123 --> 17:05.056
I'm gonna enjoy it.
(chuckles)

17:05.058 --> 17:06.758
Can't stop me
from enjoying it.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.961
Damn it!

17:18.371 --> 17:21.172
Oh, no,
you're closed.

17:21.174 --> 17:24.175
Looks like I'm late
for more terrible service.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.977
Get in here, Bubba.

17:25.979 --> 17:27.245
All right, fine.

17:27.247 --> 17:28.679
What did you want
to talk to me about?

17:28.681 --> 17:30.681
So, uh, I took another look
at your review

17:30.683 --> 17:34.519
and it wasn't
<i> totally</i> inaccurate.

17:34.521 --> 17:37.822
This is totally starting
to sound like an apology.

17:37.824 --> 17:39.357
Go on.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.725
That night was crazy,

17:40.727 --> 17:42.860
and when I saw you sitting there
I thought,

17:42.862 --> 17:44.662
"Hey, at least there's one table
that I don't have to worry about."

17:44.664 --> 17:47.532
Or serve. At all.

17:47.534 --> 17:50.201
Look, Eve,
I know you're 18 now,

17:50.203 --> 17:53.438
but sometimes all I can see
is that adorable little girl

17:53.440 --> 17:56.374
who used to
waterboard her Barbies.

17:56.376 --> 17:59.577
Hey, I got a lot of
good intel on Ken. Hmm.

17:59.579 --> 18:02.513
Anyway, I'm sorry.

18:02.515 --> 18:04.215
Thanks.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.550
And you were right,

18:05.552 --> 18:07.685
posting that review
was pretty immature,

18:07.687 --> 18:09.020
so I took it down.

18:09.022 --> 18:10.888
I promise to stop
using the Internet

18:10.890 --> 18:12.557
to blackmail family members.

18:12.559 --> 18:13.624
Good thing.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.059
Are we cool?

18:15.061 --> 18:16.961
Ah, yeah, actually,
there is one more thing.

18:16.963 --> 18:19.530
Ladies, your table awaits.

18:19.532 --> 18:23.034
What's going on? I organized a
three-course meal for the two of us.

18:23.036 --> 18:24.936
I thought, "Hey,
since we're both adults now,

18:24.938 --> 18:26.804
we could enjoy
a fancy meal together."

18:26.806 --> 18:28.372
But, Kris,
it's after 10:00.

18:28.374 --> 18:30.141
Well, yeah, I had to wait
for the restaurant to close.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.642
Besides,
what's more grown-up

18:31.644 --> 18:33.277
than staying awake
late at night?

18:33.279 --> 18:37.215
Owning a briefcase.

18:37.217 --> 18:39.317
Just get the appetizers,
Hootie.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.785
Yeah.

18:40.787 --> 18:43.955
Well, now that
we're both adults,

18:43.957 --> 18:46.257
what do you say we get some wine
up in these glasses?

18:46.259 --> 18:47.792
(chuckles sarcastically)

18:47.794 --> 18:50.194
Don't push it, kiddo.

18:54.634 --> 18:57.902
HELEN: Who's down there?!
I got a gun!

18:57.904 --> 19:02.273
Well, good luck.
I got 50 tanks.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.142
It's me, Helen. Mike.

19:04.144 --> 19:07.478
Oh. Mike!

19:07.480 --> 19:08.946
Well, I'm glad it's you.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.781
I actually
don't have a gun.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.316
That's good.

19:12.318 --> 19:15.453
It's always smart to say
you have one when you don't.

19:15.455 --> 19:16.454
What?

19:16.456 --> 19:17.488
What do you think?

19:17.490 --> 19:20.024
What did you do?

19:20.026 --> 19:23.427
This looks exactly the way
that Tom used to set it up.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.363
Well, that's
kind of the point.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.098
Now you can come down
with your boys

19:27.100 --> 19:28.966
and jog your memories
any time you want.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.535
A lot of people
were telling me

19:30.537 --> 19:32.537
that I needed to get rid
of all this stuff

19:32.539 --> 19:34.172
so that I could move on.

19:34.174 --> 19:36.541
Maybe they just
wanted your stuff.

19:37.844 --> 19:40.811
People are awful.

19:40.813 --> 19:43.047
There's nothing wrong with
holding on to a few memories.

19:43.049 --> 19:45.349
This is so cool.
Hmm.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.651
The boys
are gonna love this.

19:46.653 --> 19:48.019
I just wish
that Tom had taught us

19:48.021 --> 19:50.188
how to set up
all these battles.

19:50.190 --> 19:51.455
Well,
I'll tell you what --

19:51.457 --> 19:53.357
anytime you want,
I'll come over

19:53.359 --> 19:55.393
and tell you and you boys
exactly what happened here.

19:55.395 --> 20:00.164
Spoiler alert --
the good guys won.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.633
Wait. You love this stuff
so much

20:02.635 --> 20:04.368
that you'd be willing
to spend time with me?

20:04.370 --> 20:08.005
Yeah, you never underestimate
the power of tanks...

20:08.007 --> 20:09.440
and pork.

20:20.420 --> 20:22.019
Hey, hey, Baxter.
Got a minute?

20:22.021 --> 20:23.854
You know, I was
just about to leave,

20:23.856 --> 20:25.356
so why don't
I just do that?

20:25.358 --> 20:27.992
You -- You want to talk?
Talk to the chair.

20:27.994 --> 20:29.427
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.995
I ran into somebody
at the VFW last night.

20:30.997 --> 20:32.863
She told me a story
about being tricked

20:32.865 --> 20:34.999
out of some model tanks
she was trying to buy.

20:35.001 --> 20:37.768
Yeah, it's a cute story.
Talk to the chair.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.670
Oh.

20:39.672 --> 20:41.272
Oh!

20:41.274 --> 20:43.207
Teresa!
Mm-hmm.

20:43.209 --> 20:45.176
So,
I was talking to Chuck,

20:45.178 --> 20:47.278
and I just mentioned
the name "Mike Baxter"

20:47.280 --> 20:49.714
and his eyes lit up.

20:49.716 --> 20:51.682
They were lit already.
I'd been there a while.

20:53.052 --> 20:54.719
Carol's mother's in town.

20:54.721 --> 20:57.255
Yeah, well, I don't care
what story Chuck told you.

20:57.257 --> 20:59.690
I put the tanks
back in Helen's basement.

20:59.692 --> 21:01.025
He told me that.

21:01.027 --> 21:04.528
And that is why
I brought you this.

21:04.530 --> 21:06.964
Well, look at that.

21:06.966 --> 21:09.033
You fixed my tank.
Mm-hmm.

21:09.035 --> 21:12.036
A lot easier doing it
not inside of a sandstorm.

21:12.038 --> 21:15.439
I love all military stuff.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.475
Grew up with it.

21:17.477 --> 21:21.245
Proud to say that my father
was a Tuskegee Airman.

21:21.247 --> 21:22.647
Wow.

21:22.649 --> 21:24.315
My dad was in the military, too.
Hmm.

21:24.317 --> 21:26.050
Now he sells pot.
