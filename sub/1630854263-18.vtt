WEBVTT

00:07.000 --> 00:08.150
Ta-da.

00:08.350 --> 00:09.620
Oh, wow.
Yeah.

00:09.820 --> 00:13.040
Impressive.
Yeah.

00:14.480 --> 00:16.130
You have no idea
what this is, do you?

00:16.330 --> 00:17.860
No.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.730
This is a scale model of the new
garage we're going to open.

00:20.930 --> 00:24.640
See? Electric Vehicle
Restoration Complex.

00:24.840 --> 00:25.700
Wow.

00:25.900 --> 00:28.110
For real this time.
Yeah.

00:28.310 --> 00:30.280
Look at all the little people.
Okay.

00:30.480 --> 00:31.410
And that one right there,
that's you.

00:31.610 --> 00:33.650
So, why am I holding
a light saber?

00:33.850 --> 00:36.920
Is it because I fix cars
at lightning speed?

00:37.120 --> 00:38.980
No, Daddy. Then you'd
be the Flash.

00:39.190 --> 00:41.450
And I don't have any action
figures from the DC Universe.

00:41.650 --> 00:43.520
I assume I don't
have to explain why.

00:43.720 --> 00:47.410
Well, actually, you do,
but I don't want to hear it.

00:48.680 --> 00:53.880
Hey, Mama, check it out.
Wow. Impressive. Yeah.

00:54.650 --> 00:57.520
Okay, you two have been
married way too long.

00:58.490 --> 00:59.740
Hey, hey.

00:59.940 --> 01:01.470
Malcolm, you'll never guess
what this is.

01:01.670 --> 01:04.980
Um, looks like a scale
model of your new business.

01:05.180 --> 01:06.550
Well, yeah, you know,
y'all live together.

01:06.750 --> 01:08.100
He probably told you.

01:09.700 --> 01:10.820
This looks expensive.

01:11.020 --> 01:13.050
Can we afford to
make all this life-size?

01:13.250 --> 01:15.520
Well, Pops made a bundle
when he sold the Pit Stop.

01:15.720 --> 01:17.760
Yeah, but that's
our retirement money.

01:17.960 --> 01:21.460
We can't risk that.
Oh, no, no, life is risk, Mama.

01:21.660 --> 01:24.800
As Michael Jordan once said,
you miss 100% of the shots

01:25.000 --> 01:27.370
you don't take.
Hey, wasn't that Tiger Woods?

01:27.570 --> 01:30.620
It's Wayne Gretzky.
Read a book.

01:31.850 --> 01:33.640
Look, don't worry
about the risk, babe.

01:33.840 --> 01:36.010
We're going to borrow
the money from the bank.

01:36.210 --> 01:38.840
All right? They're going to be
begging us to take their money.

01:39.040 --> 01:41.010
And I'm going to be like,
"Nah, bro."

01:41.210 --> 01:42.720
And then they're going
to be like, "Calvin,

01:42.920 --> 01:45.450
please take our money,"
and I'll be like,

01:45.650 --> 01:47.490
"Aw, I don't know, man."

01:47.690 --> 01:49.490
And then they gonna offer me
some more money,

01:49.690 --> 01:51.160
and I'll be like,
"Eh, should I? Should I?"

01:51.360 --> 01:52.560
(laughter)

01:52.760 --> 01:54.030
That's when they gonna double
the offer,

01:54.230 --> 01:56.460
and I'm gonna be like,
"All right then."

01:56.660 --> 01:59.600
(laughter, excited chatter)

01:59.800 --> 02:02.120
Eh... Back to real life.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.800
You know, it's never
that easy to get a loan.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.210
It is when you
have an idea this good.

02:08.410 --> 02:10.810
Servicing electric vehicles that
have fallen out of warranty.

02:11.010 --> 02:14.280
It's going to be huge.
Then I can kiss JPL goodbye.

02:14.480 --> 02:16.950
Oh, and it lights up.

02:17.150 --> 02:20.320
Oh!
Come on!

02:20.520 --> 02:22.020
Well, check this out.

02:22.220 --> 02:24.420
Your company has a
gender-neutral bathroom.

02:24.620 --> 02:26.330
How progressive of you, Pop.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.900
Hey, look, me?
Nah, I'm down with whatever,

02:30.100 --> 02:32.200
you know what I'm saying?
But I am going to need

02:32.400 --> 02:33.470
my own bathroom.

02:33.670 --> 02:35.470
I get a shy bladder
when women are around.

02:35.670 --> 02:36.970
MARTY:
Okay.

02:37.170 --> 02:38.590
(laughing)

02:40.260 --> 02:41.590
You better.

02:44.390 --> 02:46.280
* Welcome to the block,
welcome to the neighborhood *

02:46.480 --> 02:47.960
* Welcome to the hood. *

02:54.040 --> 02:56.860
Ooh. Good news. The laser tag
people just confirmed

02:57.060 --> 02:58.120
for Grover's birthday.

02:58.320 --> 02:59.690
They still can't do my party,
huh?

02:59.890 --> 03:00.930
They said no.

03:01.130 --> 03:02.260
Hmm.

03:02.460 --> 03:04.750
It just seems like...
I didn't ask them, Dave.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.070
You know,
it's not just for kids, Gemma.

03:09.270 --> 03:11.470
There's a lot of strategy in LT.
That's laser tag.

03:11.670 --> 03:12.660
Oh, boy.

03:14.360 --> 03:17.180
You have to be stealth,
have catlike reflexes,

03:17.380 --> 03:19.450
and you always keep
your back up against the wall

03:19.650 --> 03:22.500
so nobody can sneak up on you.
Dave.

03:24.770 --> 03:26.290
Hey, Gregory.

03:26.490 --> 03:29.620
Oh, hi. I'm Gemma, Dave's wife.
It's nice to meet you.

03:29.820 --> 03:31.370
Gregory.

03:34.010 --> 03:35.760
Uh, we were just
having lunch together

03:35.960 --> 03:38.400
and planning our son's
13th birthday party.

03:38.600 --> 03:42.300
Oh, birthdays are fun.
You know what's not fun?

03:42.500 --> 03:45.240
Being married for 20 years,
and you wake up one day and

03:45.440 --> 03:48.390
your wife tells you she's
leaving you for her trainer.

03:50.460 --> 03:53.110
Oh, I'm so sorry to hear that.

03:53.310 --> 03:55.210
Yeah, that's
really tough, um...

03:55.410 --> 03:58.220
(clears throat) Gregory.
That's-that's-that's, uh...

03:58.420 --> 04:00.300
That's really tough.

04:05.740 --> 04:06.860
I'm going to go.

04:07.060 --> 04:08.860
Yeah.

04:09.060 --> 04:10.660
You haven't finished your lunch.

04:10.860 --> 04:12.050
I'm full.

04:14.820 --> 04:17.770
Gosh, Gregory, I'm really sorry
to hear about you and your wife.

04:17.970 --> 04:19.310
Oh, it's working out okay.

04:19.510 --> 04:20.710
I'm looking forward
to the weekend.

04:20.910 --> 04:23.340
I've moved into a condo.
I'm building a bookshelf.

04:23.540 --> 04:25.580
Oh, and I'm working out
at the gym on Saturday.

04:25.780 --> 04:28.810
Well, that's great. Seems like
a positive step towards healing.

04:29.010 --> 04:31.500
With the same trainer
my wife left me for.

04:32.900 --> 04:35.770
I am never going to prepay
for anything ever again.

04:37.070 --> 04:39.220
But it sounds like you're
going to have a good weekend.

04:39.430 --> 04:41.990
Ha! Yeah. Please.
If you're interested

04:42.190 --> 04:44.060
in coming to a party
with cold pizza

04:44.260 --> 04:46.670
and 20 or so screaming kids
all shooting at each other,

04:46.870 --> 04:48.350
let me know.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.870
Sounds like fun. Thanks.

04:51.070 --> 04:53.220
Yeah, you're welcome.
(chuckles)

04:59.730 --> 05:01.560
Sounds like fun?

05:03.030 --> 05:04.570
What the hell just happened?

05:08.240 --> 05:09.490
You invited your weird,

05:09.690 --> 05:13.130
sad-ass boss to our
son's birthday party?

05:13.330 --> 05:15.230
I don't know.
I didn't mean to.

05:15.430 --> 05:17.660
I was obviously joking
when I made the offer.

05:17.860 --> 05:20.400
Was he obviously joking
when he accepted?

05:20.600 --> 05:23.350
It's not clear that he knows
what a joke is.

05:24.620 --> 05:27.290
But maybe he does.
Look, I don't know.

05:28.620 --> 05:32.480
Well, you better figure it out.
I want this day to be special.

05:32.680 --> 05:35.080
Our little boy is
becoming a teenager.

05:35.280 --> 05:36.780
You only get one
13th birthday.

05:36.980 --> 05:41.270
Well, you only ever really
ever get one of each birthday.

05:42.070 --> 05:45.240
You think that was a smart thing
to say right now, Dave?

05:46.840 --> 05:49.700
I can't have that downer
at the birthday party.

05:49.900 --> 05:52.970
I don't want the kids to see how
bad their lives could turn out.

05:53.170 --> 05:54.870
What am I supposed to do?
He's my boss.

05:55.070 --> 05:57.540
It's already weird.
This will just make it weirder.

05:57.740 --> 06:01.810
Just give him the wrong date
by accident on purpose.

06:02.010 --> 06:03.590
I do it all the time.

06:04.930 --> 06:06.850
Is that why I missed
your birthday party

06:07.050 --> 06:08.430
when we first moved here?

06:09.930 --> 06:12.800
All right, it's looking good.
I'll see y'all later.

06:20.440 --> 06:23.160
(mutters, sniffs)
H-H-Hey!

06:23.360 --> 06:26.160
Check you out, Pop.
(chuckles)

06:26.360 --> 06:28.130
Looking cleaner
than a game show host.

06:28.330 --> 06:32.200
Ah. Survey says you ain't lying.

06:32.400 --> 06:35.170
Okay. What's the occasion?

06:35.370 --> 06:36.510
Well, me and Marty,

06:36.710 --> 06:37.880
we're going to the bank
to get a loan.

06:38.080 --> 06:39.900
Okay.
Hey, hey.

06:40.900 --> 06:42.330
No!

06:43.300 --> 06:44.250
What?

06:44.450 --> 06:45.980
Go put on a suit.

06:46.180 --> 06:47.120
What's wrong with this?

06:47.320 --> 06:48.900
It's not a suit.

06:50.240 --> 06:52.320
If there's one thing
I've learned,

06:52.530 --> 06:54.560
it's that you have to look
like you have money

06:54.760 --> 06:59.010
if you want people
to give you more money.

06:59.980 --> 07:04.850
Well, then I'm good,
because this hoodie cost $250.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.760
You paid $250 for gym clothes?

07:10.160 --> 07:11.210
Go change.

07:11.410 --> 07:12.860
But, Daddy...
Go on now.

07:17.370 --> 07:18.850
Great to see you again, Calvin.

07:19.050 --> 07:21.320
Marty. I remember when you
were just a little tyke,

07:21.520 --> 07:23.460
running around the Pit Stop
with a baseball bat.

07:23.660 --> 07:26.190
Oh, that was my other
son, Malcolm.

07:26.390 --> 07:28.190
Oh, this is the nerd.

07:28.390 --> 07:30.900
Mm-hmm.

07:31.100 --> 07:32.260
How you doing?

07:32.460 --> 07:33.870
Good. Good.

07:34.070 --> 07:35.830
So, what am I looking at?

07:36.030 --> 07:37.970
Well, you're looking
at the future here, Doug.

07:38.170 --> 07:40.140
You see the people
who are out there driving

07:40.340 --> 07:42.410
electric cars,
when they have a problem,

07:42.610 --> 07:44.610
they're hostages
to the dealership.

07:44.810 --> 07:47.280
We're going to give them
a better, cheaper option.

07:47.480 --> 07:48.750
How are you going to do that?

07:48.950 --> 07:50.520
Well, the first thing we have
to do is reverse...

07:50.720 --> 07:53.220
Son, I got this.
Okay.

07:53.420 --> 07:54.940
Kids.

07:56.670 --> 08:00.130
Doug, the problem with
electric cars is that, one,

08:00.330 --> 08:02.390
they're electrified, all right?

08:02.600 --> 08:04.560
There's electricity.
You're dealing with that.

08:04.760 --> 08:07.930
You mix that, obviously--
the electrons

08:08.130 --> 08:11.040
of the electrolytes
is what happens, right?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.610
And if you take these and you
remove each electro-size...

08:14.810 --> 08:16.640
electron...
You know what, Marty?

08:16.840 --> 08:19.010
Why don't you go ahead and
tell him what we're going to do.

08:19.210 --> 08:20.410
Just gonna hop in right there.

08:20.610 --> 08:22.520
First of all,
none of what you just said.

08:22.720 --> 08:24.220
You see,

08:24.420 --> 08:25.650
each car manufacturer

08:25.850 --> 08:27.150
has its own
unique operating system.

08:27.350 --> 08:29.190
And if you can figure out how to
reverse engineer it,

08:29.390 --> 08:31.220
which,
with my background at JPL,

08:31.420 --> 08:32.860
I can, then you can repair

08:33.060 --> 08:34.830
any brand of electric car.
Hmm.

08:35.030 --> 08:36.660
And we could do it
cheaper than the dealership.

08:36.860 --> 08:39.200
Huh. That is an interesting
idea. And what would you be

08:39.400 --> 08:41.800
securing the loan with?
Securing it?

08:42.000 --> 08:44.370
Well, we never do a loan
this size without collateral.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.440
Your home, investment property.

08:46.640 --> 08:48.610
(stammers)
Doug, come on.

08:48.810 --> 08:51.880
You don't need collateral
for an idea this good.

08:52.080 --> 08:54.410
It's no risk.

08:54.610 --> 08:56.620
I mean, you know me,
and I know you,

08:56.820 --> 09:00.700
so that's collateral enough.
(laughing)

09:02.000 --> 09:04.520
(laughing forcefully)
Oh, my God.

09:04.720 --> 09:08.460
(chuckling)
Okay, Calvin. Sounds great.

09:08.660 --> 09:10.860
There we go. There we go!
All right!

09:11.060 --> 09:13.470
All right. So, uh,

09:13.670 --> 09:15.570
how long are we talking?
Oh, very soon.

09:15.770 --> 09:17.950
Just let me talk to my team,
run it up the flagpole.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.310
There is no flagpole,
is there, Doug?

09:23.510 --> 09:24.840
Well...

09:25.040 --> 09:26.950
So you're not going to
give us the money?

09:27.150 --> 09:28.160
I'm not.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.480
But I didn't want to say it
in front of your little slugger.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.570
I'm the nerd.

09:39.610 --> 09:40.830
Hey, Gregory.

09:41.030 --> 09:43.300
Uh, just curious.
When you said my son's

09:43.500 --> 09:45.860
birthday party sounded like fun,
you were joking, right?

09:46.060 --> 09:47.330
Were you joking?

09:47.530 --> 09:49.700
Me? No.

09:49.900 --> 09:53.860
Good. Because I spent
$600 on a gift.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.240
(laughing)

09:56.440 --> 09:58.840
That's funny.
You know, 600 dol...

09:59.040 --> 10:02.310
It's your wife's loss. You are
way funnier than that trainer.

10:02.510 --> 10:04.050
He doesn't have
to be funny.

10:04.250 --> 10:05.730
He has abs.

10:06.770 --> 10:08.690
But I wasn't joking.

10:08.890 --> 10:10.510
You...

10:12.370 --> 10:14.090
My God. Uh...

10:14.290 --> 10:15.790
You got my son a PlayStation 5.

10:15.990 --> 10:19.060
Yes. How weird
would it be if I showed up

10:19.260 --> 10:21.000
at a kid's party without a gift?

10:21.200 --> 10:23.470
(chuckles)
Right.

10:23.670 --> 10:25.940
Sure. Because, you know,
that would be weird.

10:26.140 --> 10:27.760
Yeah.

10:36.530 --> 10:39.450
So the bank said no?
I don't know what happened.

10:39.650 --> 10:43.320
I had on my best suit,
the cufflinks, the good cologne.

10:43.520 --> 10:45.490
I even hit him with
my rich white guy chuckle.

10:45.690 --> 10:47.710
(chuckles loudly)

10:48.780 --> 10:53.830
Telling me we need collateral.
The Butler name is collateral.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.200
(Tina groans)

10:55.400 --> 10:57.440
You know what? Look,
you gave it all you got.

10:57.640 --> 10:58.840
You know?

10:59.040 --> 11:02.240
And if it's any consolation,
you look handsome.

11:02.440 --> 11:07.050
Well, my dreams are shattered,
but my mama thinks I'm handsome.

11:07.250 --> 11:09.230
It's a wash.

11:11.670 --> 11:12.950
What am I hearing?

11:13.150 --> 11:14.690
One rejection and y'all
are giving up?

11:14.890 --> 11:16.790
Do you know how many times
the Wright brothers

11:16.990 --> 11:18.860
crashed to the ground
before they were able to fly?

11:19.060 --> 11:20.160
How many?

11:20.360 --> 11:21.990
I don't know exactly, Pop,

11:22.190 --> 11:24.200
but I'm sure
it was a bunch of times.

11:24.400 --> 11:27.530
Marty doesn't need to
go crashing around in planes.

11:27.730 --> 11:30.700
He needs to stay at JPL,
which is like a nice, safe bus.

11:30.900 --> 11:33.370
Statistically, more people die
in buses than planes.

11:33.570 --> 11:36.810
Stop hating on my point,
Marty.

11:37.010 --> 11:38.180
I'm just saying that maybe

11:38.380 --> 11:39.910
the universe
is telling us something.

11:40.110 --> 11:41.350
Maybe Marty should keep
his nice,

11:41.550 --> 11:42.920
steady job and
your father and I could

11:43.120 --> 11:44.870
keep our nice, cozy nest egg.

11:45.630 --> 11:47.850
I don't want to just
keep punching the clock at JPL.

11:48.050 --> 11:49.550
Especially when we're
sitting on such a great idea.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.470
And if we don't do it,
somebody else will.

11:53.540 --> 11:56.360
You know what?
Maybe we should be pitching this

11:56.560 --> 11:59.130
like a tech start-up.
Go venture capitalist.

11:59.330 --> 12:01.500
Exactly. You see, they
have vision. They take risks.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.300
Yeah, they move fast.
They break things.

12:03.500 --> 12:05.750
So do toddlers.
What's your point?

12:07.390 --> 12:09.110
What I'm saying is,
I know a guy that used

12:09.310 --> 12:11.080
to work at JPL
who made a fortune on crypto.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.640
Now he's an angel investor.

12:12.850 --> 12:14.380
Angel investor?

12:14.580 --> 12:17.820
That sound like a fancy way
of saying sugar daddy.

12:18.020 --> 12:22.200
Marty, I ain't doing nothing
strange for some change.

12:31.850 --> 12:34.570
Marty, I feel ridiculous.

12:34.770 --> 12:38.020
I got on this big jacket,
and half my legs are out.

12:38.850 --> 12:40.340
Dad, this is what
you have to wear when you're

12:40.540 --> 12:41.740
meeting with
a young investor.

12:41.940 --> 12:43.340
Well, it better work fast,

12:43.540 --> 12:45.980
because I'm cold on the bottom
and I'm hot on the top.

12:46.180 --> 12:50.300
(humming)

12:51.670 --> 12:52.750
What was that?

12:52.950 --> 12:54.670
That's who we're here to meet.

12:55.570 --> 12:57.660
(grunting rhythmically)

12:57.860 --> 13:01.560
Marty and Marty's dad!
Things are getting litty.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.500
What is up?
Hey, thanks for
having us, Pike.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.000
Pike? Is that your last
name or your first name?

13:08.200 --> 13:09.520
Yes.

13:12.320 --> 13:14.320
Guys, have a seat.

13:17.430 --> 13:19.440
Uh, you know,
I think I'll stand.

13:19.640 --> 13:22.250
I don't have beanbag knees.

13:22.450 --> 13:24.530
Take a swing.

13:25.500 --> 13:30.420
Yeah. Okay, sure.
Yeah, I'll just swing.

13:30.620 --> 13:31.420
Okay.

13:31.620 --> 13:34.560
All right.
Okay.

13:34.760 --> 13:38.260
Yeah. Feeling litty.
Yeah, very good. Very litty.

13:38.460 --> 13:41.200
Let's get into it.
Blow me away.

13:41.400 --> 13:42.970
Use-use your legs, Daddy.

13:43.170 --> 13:45.320
Okay.

13:46.960 --> 13:49.110
Uh... You got to...

13:49.310 --> 13:54.480
Hey, uh, I hate to
be-be rude here, but, uh,

13:54.680 --> 13:56.950
is this a business
or a daycare center?

13:57.150 --> 13:59.280
Ha! Daycare center.

13:59.480 --> 14:01.090
I like this guy.

14:01.290 --> 14:04.490
Yeah. My dad is hilarious.

14:04.690 --> 14:05.560
I'm going to cut to the chase.

14:05.760 --> 14:06.760
I read your guys' one-liner.

14:06.960 --> 14:07.930
I'm very interested.

14:08.130 --> 14:09.490
Okay, well,

14:09.690 --> 14:11.030
we think there's
about to be

14:11.230 --> 14:13.300
a huge market in EVs that are
falling out of warranty.

14:13.500 --> 14:14.830
One question.

14:15.030 --> 14:16.840
You're going to reverse engineer
the operating systems?

14:17.040 --> 14:18.600
Yes.
I'm in.

14:18.800 --> 14:20.170
Oh.

14:20.370 --> 14:22.810
I'm sorry, I missed it, guys.

14:23.010 --> 14:25.180
I'm in.
Oh!

14:25.380 --> 14:26.850
So, wait a minute.

14:27.050 --> 14:30.080
You don't have to, uh, talk
to your team or your-your mom?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.720
(laughs)
I love this guy.

14:32.920 --> 14:35.490
Okay. Whoa.

14:35.690 --> 14:37.620
I only got one problem.
Uh-oh.

14:37.820 --> 14:40.230
You guys aren't
asking for enough money.

14:40.430 --> 14:41.790
We need to add a zero.

14:41.990 --> 14:44.280
Well, all right!

14:46.080 --> 14:47.600
Dudes, let's make history.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.400
I'll text my guy to
wire you the money now.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.340
Morton Alderman.
Yeah?

14:53.540 --> 14:55.210
You're under arrest
for securities fraud,

14:55.410 --> 14:56.470
wire fraud and
money laundering.

14:56.670 --> 14:59.130
Securities fraud?
Marty, call my mom!

15:00.200 --> 15:03.820
Officer, could you let him hit
"send" before you take him away?

15:04.020 --> 15:06.320
Was he sending you money?

15:06.520 --> 15:08.290
Money? No.

15:08.490 --> 15:10.390
No, no, no, no, no.

15:10.590 --> 15:11.660
No money. No, no.

15:11.860 --> 15:13.710
He was sending me a meme.
Memes.

15:14.680 --> 15:16.260
Y-You seen the one with the baby

15:16.460 --> 15:18.330
on the horse,
and then the daddy come in?

15:18.530 --> 15:20.800
And the daddy say,
"Give my baby back."

15:21.000 --> 15:22.170
It was...

15:22.370 --> 15:24.720
Yeah.
Let's get out of here.

15:26.190 --> 15:28.390
(weapons chirping)

15:29.290 --> 15:30.680
So not fair.

15:30.880 --> 15:31.880
What happened?

15:32.080 --> 15:33.350
We just won again.

15:33.550 --> 15:34.960
Gregory is so good!

15:37.230 --> 15:38.080
Yes, he is.

15:38.280 --> 15:39.280
Every round, he zapped me

15:39.480 --> 15:40.750
in the first five seconds.

15:40.950 --> 15:43.320
You left yourself
wide open, man.

15:43.520 --> 15:45.790
This game is so easy.

15:45.990 --> 15:49.010
Gregory, you were
a sharpshooter in the Marines.

15:50.710 --> 15:53.900
Hey, Gemma, thank you so much
for letting me bring a plus-one.

15:54.100 --> 15:56.780
How you doing, Mumbles?

15:58.020 --> 15:59.370
I didn't want
to leave him at home.

15:59.570 --> 16:02.260
He's been having
some digestive issues.

16:03.260 --> 16:07.380
Ah. Well, I just caught him
eating a whole box of donuts

16:07.580 --> 16:09.760
but maybe that'll
help settle his stomach.

16:11.830 --> 16:14.020
Mumbles, were you a naughty boy?

16:14.220 --> 16:17.320
Hey, you know what, Gregory?
Maybe Mumbles needs some air.

16:17.520 --> 16:19.090
You know, feel free to take...

16:19.290 --> 16:20.640
(weapon chirping)

16:22.080 --> 16:23.830
Come on, man. Really?

16:24.030 --> 16:26.410
There are no rules in war,
David.

16:29.020 --> 16:32.640
I am so sorry
you didn't get the money, guys.

16:32.840 --> 16:34.510
But, look, don't
be discouraged.

16:34.710 --> 16:36.410
There's so many other
things you can try.

16:36.610 --> 16:38.680
Remember we went to that
farmer's market

16:38.880 --> 16:40.650
and we saw that guy
who sold his own honey?

16:40.850 --> 16:42.530
You thought that was so cool.

16:43.330 --> 16:45.800
I need bees, Tina.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.320
Oh, look.

16:49.520 --> 16:50.920
Yeah.
David's friend.

16:51.120 --> 16:53.830
Okay. Not right now, Gregory.
I am having a hard day.

16:54.030 --> 16:57.660
Day? Must be nice.
I'm having a hard year.

16:57.860 --> 17:00.270
My wife left me
for a guy who looks like

17:00.470 --> 17:01.970
Brad Pitt in <i>Fight Club.</i>

17:02.170 --> 17:04.790
Damn, that's prime Pitt.

17:06.320 --> 17:10.410
It's not just his looks.
He's a risk-taker and I'm not.

17:10.610 --> 17:13.080
I'm just a normie
with a nine-to-five

17:13.280 --> 17:15.830
on his fourth
Toyota Corolla.

17:17.270 --> 17:18.880
And now
look at me.

17:19.080 --> 17:21.050
Here I am, stuck at
a kid's birthday party

17:21.250 --> 17:23.390
I didn't even want to go to, but

17:23.590 --> 17:25.010
Dave invited me
and then made it weird.

17:27.040 --> 17:30.660
Hey, Gregory,
Mumbles is barking in his sleep,

17:30.860 --> 17:32.330
and he is scaring the kids.

17:32.530 --> 17:34.830
Oh, God.
The nightmares are back.

17:35.030 --> 17:37.040
Oh...

17:37.240 --> 17:38.400
Man.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.500
What?

17:39.700 --> 17:40.870
I'm Gregory.

17:41.070 --> 17:42.470
What? What are you
talking about?

17:42.670 --> 17:43.840
I'm Gregory.
Think about it.

17:44.040 --> 17:45.480
I just lost my fiancée,
I'm stuck at

17:45.680 --> 17:47.150
a boring job,
I'm playing it safe.

17:47.350 --> 17:50.220
Oh, no. Come on, Marty.
It's not like that.

17:50.420 --> 17:51.650
I drive a Chevy Bolt!

17:51.850 --> 17:54.000
That's the Corolla
of electric cars.

17:55.300 --> 17:58.160
Calm down, Marty,
we're still in this thing.

17:58.360 --> 18:00.380
We'll...
We'll figure it out.

18:01.080 --> 18:03.930
Calvin, I love that you're
supporting our baby's dream.

18:04.130 --> 18:05.750
And I always will.

18:08.650 --> 18:10.870
You know what?

18:11.070 --> 18:12.300
Go for it.

18:12.500 --> 18:13.840
Excuse me?

18:14.040 --> 18:17.010
To hell with counting
on other people's money.

18:17.210 --> 18:19.710
This is a great idea.
Whatever we need to do to

18:19.910 --> 18:21.350
get that loan, let's do it.

18:21.550 --> 18:23.170
Are you serious?

18:24.470 --> 18:26.450
Baby, I believe in us.

18:26.650 --> 18:28.450
You know, I was so
worried about the money,

18:28.650 --> 18:31.190
I wasn't thinking
about what this meant for Marty.

18:31.390 --> 18:35.080
I don't want him to end up
a sad man with a saggy dog.

18:37.250 --> 18:40.200
Really, Mama?
Yes, baby.

18:40.400 --> 18:42.270
So, Dad, are we back in?

18:42.470 --> 18:44.040
Yes.
Yes!

18:44.240 --> 18:45.970
We in it to win it.
You know what?

18:46.170 --> 18:49.170
It's a risk we can handle
because we have the collateral.

18:49.370 --> 18:50.340
We got the house.

18:50.540 --> 18:51.440
Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:51.640 --> 18:52.910
You are risking the house?

18:53.110 --> 18:55.550
All right, Pop,
that's what I'm talking about.

18:55.750 --> 18:58.080
Betting on yourself.
That is bold.

18:58.280 --> 18:59.950
I'm not that bold.

19:00.150 --> 19:01.850
No, I'm risking your house.
Yeah.

19:02.050 --> 19:04.290
Whoa, whoa, whoa, that seems
like a rash decision.

19:04.490 --> 19:05.820
I like it, and I'm in.

19:06.020 --> 19:08.590
Of course you're in, Marty.
It's your business.

19:08.790 --> 19:10.460
I'm not even involved
and y'all risking my house.

19:10.660 --> 19:12.730
Shh! Don't worry, baby.

19:12.930 --> 19:15.270
Worst-case scenario,
you can move

19:15.470 --> 19:16.730
back in with your mama.

19:16.930 --> 19:20.090
I mean, it's a win-win for me.
(squeals)

19:21.460 --> 19:22.710
And listen, Malcolm.

19:22.910 --> 19:25.110
If we lose the house,

19:25.310 --> 19:27.750
I'll give you your deposit back.

19:27.950 --> 19:29.750
I didn't give you any deposit.

19:29.950 --> 19:31.900
So what the hell
you complaining about?

19:39.410 --> 19:42.130
LeBron to the hole. Boom!

19:42.330 --> 19:44.430
Ha-ha! I love this game.

19:44.630 --> 19:47.670
You know, this is the best
present Grover's ever got.

19:47.870 --> 19:50.220
Can I get a turn?

19:51.020 --> 19:53.240
In a minute.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.210
You said that 90 minutes ago.

19:55.410 --> 19:58.730
Well, I'm only down
43 points.

19:59.790 --> 20:03.220
I can't believe Gregory
bought this boy a PS5.

20:03.420 --> 20:05.620
Me neither.
I told him he could come over

20:05.820 --> 20:07.100
and play it anytime.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.260
You what?

20:10.460 --> 20:12.760
Well, I mean,
I was obviously joking.

20:12.960 --> 20:14.440
(doorbell rings)

20:15.910 --> 20:17.810
It couldn't be, could it?

20:22.220 --> 20:24.390
It is.

20:29.220 --> 20:30.810
Ha! Gregory.

20:31.010 --> 20:34.510
Surprised to see you here
on this Saturday night

20:34.710 --> 20:36.880
at... 9:00 p.m.

20:37.080 --> 20:39.550
Yeah, it wasn't my plan,

20:39.750 --> 20:43.170
but Grover invited me
and then made it weird.

20:45.170 --> 20:47.340
Guess I got next.
