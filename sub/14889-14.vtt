Okay, thanks.

13:29.266 --> 13:32.566
Excuse me...could you help us?

13:32.600 --> 13:34.300
Come on, pal,
we can’t do every thing.

13:35.266 --> 13:37.133
Aah!
Wait a minute.

13:37.166 --> 13:39.166
You can’t take him.
I need him.

13:39.200 --> 13:40.200
So does the surgeon.

13:40.233 --> 13:42.266
He can’t operate on
his knee without ’em.

13:42.300 --> 13:44.266
We’ll be back
for Mr. Vaughn later.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.666
[Balki groaning]

13:50.466 --> 13:52.500
Balki, this‐this‐this
is terrible.

13:52.533 --> 13:55.033
Oh, cousin, it’s not so bad.

13:56.433 --> 13:58.533
I’m sure Mr. Vaughn
don’t mind waiting.

13:58.566 --> 14:01.300
[instrumental music]

14:06.733 --> 14:08.266
[instrumental music]

14:12.666 --> 14:15.366
Cousin, you know,
it was so easy

14:15.400 --> 14:18.033
to get Mr. Vaughan back
in bed after I found out

14:18.066 --> 14:20.700
that he likes to play
"Simon says" in his sleep.

14:23.700 --> 14:26.533
Simon says raise your legs.

14:32.400 --> 14:34.200
Put your legs down.

14:36.533 --> 14:38.166
He’s good.

14:42.266 --> 14:44.666
Simon says put your legs down.

14:49.766 --> 14:51.500
Cousin, we can go now.

14:51.533 --> 14:55.033
Balki, I’m not leaving until
they bring Hank back.

14:55.066 --> 14:58.466
Cousin, learn to let go.

15:00.133 --> 15:01.633
Hank is in good hands

15:01.666 --> 15:04.266
and there are plenty of other
patients who need our help.

15:04.300 --> 15:06.400
But they don’t play football
for the Chicago Bears

15:06.433 --> 15:08.566
and Hank Peterson does.

15:13.400 --> 15:18.400
Oh‐ho, now I get it!

15:18.433 --> 15:21.466
You didn’t come here
to‐to‐to help patients.

15:21.500 --> 15:24.533
You came to get an interview
with Hank Peterson.

15:24.566 --> 15:27.400
So what if I did?

15:27.433 --> 15:30.300
If I get this interview
it’ll mean a lot for my career.

15:30.333 --> 15:32.766
But, cousin, you’re doing a good
thing for a selfish reason.

15:32.800 --> 15:37.466
That’s wrong. Do I have to
review the order for you again?

15:37.500 --> 15:42.066
First you do good things,
then good things happen.

15:42.100 --> 15:44.033
Balki, you know
what your problem is?

15:44.066 --> 15:45.500
You’re too rigid.

15:46.300 --> 15:47.633
I’ll do my hospital work

15:47.666 --> 15:50.600
after they bring Hank back
and I interview him.

15:50.633 --> 15:54.766
Well, they’re not going to bring
him back, Mr. Smarty Trousers.

15:57.133 --> 16:00.166
He’s going to the Recovery Room.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.600
Well, then I’ll interview him
in the Recovery Room.

16:04.266 --> 16:06.733
‐Good thinking, cousin.
‐Thank you.

16:08.166 --> 16:10.700
(Balki)
’Can you pretend to have a key?’

16:11.600 --> 16:13.566
A key?

16:13.600 --> 16:16.700
Doctors use them to open
the Recovery Room.

16:21.333 --> 16:23.633
‐Someone else must have a key.
‐Nope, only doctors

16:23.666 --> 16:28.300
and the occasional
trusted Mypiot volunteer.

16:36.133 --> 16:38.300
‐Balki?
‐Yes?

16:40.166 --> 16:42.700
Do you have a key?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.133
‐No.
‐No?

16:46.166 --> 16:50.100
That was the other
Mypiot volunteer.

16:51.233 --> 16:55.366
Balki, may I have
the key, please?

16:55.400 --> 16:57.033
No, cousin!

16:57.066 --> 16:59.600
And I’ll never
tell you where it is.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.633
Balki, give me the key!

17:04.665 --> 17:07.233
Ha!

17:07.266 --> 17:09.700
When pigs walk!

17:12.165 --> 17:16.366
No, no, no, no. No, no, no.

17:16.400 --> 17:19.233
Aah! No, no, no.

17:19.266 --> 17:21.733
Balki...

17:21.766 --> 17:25.099
...give me the key.

17:25.133 --> 17:26.366
Never!

17:26.400 --> 17:29.133
[air hissing]

17:29.766 --> 17:33.366
Balki, give me the key.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.433
Never!

17:34.466 --> 17:37.700
[air hissing]

17:37.733 --> 17:40.433
Balki, give me the key

17:40.466 --> 17:44.533
or I’ll squeeze
your brains out.

17:44.566 --> 17:45.600
Never!

17:45.633 --> 17:47.566
[air hissing]

17:48.500 --> 17:49.566
Never!

17:49.600 --> 17:52.000
[hissing continues]

17:53.300 --> 17:56.066
[indistinct chatter]

17:56.100 --> 17:58.033
Balki! Balki! Balki!

17:58.066 --> 18:01.000
Just kidding, cousin.
Hee hee hee.

18:02.600 --> 18:04.400
Ha!

18:06.433 --> 18:08.266
You’ll never get that key!

18:08.300 --> 18:10.166
Aah!

18:10.666 --> 18:12.766
Aah!

18:12.800 --> 18:14.100
Ha ha ha!

18:14.133 --> 18:16.133
Oh, oh, oh!

18:16.166 --> 18:18.466
Simon says hug!

18:20.466 --> 18:23.033
Alright, Balki.
Two can play at this game.

18:23.066 --> 18:25.233
Simon says let go.

18:25.266 --> 18:27.700
Ha!

18:27.733 --> 18:29.700
It only works for me.

18:29.733 --> 18:31.766
I’m it.

18:33.100 --> 18:35.033
Alright, Balki,
please, please, please.

18:35.066 --> 18:36.300
I need the key.

18:36.333 --> 18:39.100
Cousin, you promised to work for
the hospital, not for yourself.

18:39.133 --> 18:41.766
Balki, if you help me,
I’ll work here for a month.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.166
A month? Ha!

18:44.200 --> 18:46.433
Simon says hug tighter.

18:46.466 --> 18:48.033
[Larry groaning]

18:49.566 --> 18:51.466
Six months!

18:52.800 --> 18:55.033
Simon says let go.

18:57.333 --> 19:00.300
[instrumental music]

19:11.300 --> 19:14.500
Hank. Hank. Hank, wake up.

19:15.833 --> 19:18.566
Hi, mom. We’re number one.

19:20.833 --> 19:23.100
Hank, Hank, Hank, wake up.

19:23.133 --> 19:24.233
We’re doctors

19:24.266 --> 19:29.100
and‐and we need a little
post‐operative information.

19:29.133 --> 19:30.066
What?

19:30.100 --> 19:33.033
Are you ever going to
play football again?

19:33.066 --> 19:35.766
Oh, you’re the doctor.
What are you asking me for?

19:36.766 --> 19:38.133
Balki?

19:38.166 --> 19:39.633
Hi, Hank.

19:39.666 --> 19:42.066
What are you doing here?

19:42.100 --> 19:44.433
Is it story time?

19:46.700 --> 19:48.800
Not until after dinner.

19:48.833 --> 19:51.433
Hank, we‐we were,
we were wondering‐‐

19:51.466 --> 19:54.500
Balki, please.
Balki, Balki, please.

19:54.533 --> 19:56.266
Hank, my name is Larry Appleton.

19:56.300 --> 19:58.633
I’m a reporter with
The Chicago Chronicle.

19:58.666 --> 20:00.300
Cousin, I think I can help.

20:00.333 --> 20:02.133
Balki, you can help
by being quiet.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.300
So, short interview?
What do you say, Hank?

20:06.333 --> 20:08.500
I say no.

20:08.533 --> 20:10.500
Well, that’s it.
I’m through. I’m finished.

20:12.166 --> 20:15.166
Cousin, may I speak now?

20:15.200 --> 20:17.533
You can do anything you want.
My life is over.

20:21.233 --> 20:24.433
Hank, he’s a friend of mine.

20:25.633 --> 20:27.733
Well, why didn’t you say so?

20:30.266 --> 20:32.733
I tell you what, my doctors are
gonna be in in a few minutes.

20:32.766 --> 20:34.266
Why don’t you stick around

20:34.300 --> 20:35.500
and we’ll find out
whether or not

20:35.533 --> 20:37.700
they’re gonna retire my jersey?

20:37.733 --> 20:39.633
You have a cow?

20:40.633 --> 20:43.466
[instrumental music]

20:55.066 --> 20:56.033
Appleton.

20:56.066 --> 20:58.600
‐Yes, sir, Mr. Wainwright.
‐Great interview.

20:58.633 --> 21:01.600
We were the first paper to tell
Chicago Hank will be back.

21:01.633 --> 21:02.833
Thank you, sir.

21:02.866 --> 21:06.300
But‐but I couldn’t have done it
without Balki’s help.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.666
Nice work, Bartokomous.

21:07.700 --> 21:10.433
Thank you, Mr. Wainwright.

21:11.833 --> 21:13.733
Well, you and Appleton
make a good team.

21:13.766 --> 21:16.066
Well, you know what they say...

21:16.100 --> 21:17.800
...a bird in the hand

21:17.833 --> 21:19.466
will just keep pecking

21:19.500 --> 21:22.733
and pecking and
pecking and pecking

21:22.766 --> 21:25.400
until your hand
starts to bleed.

21:27.066 --> 21:28.600
He helped you?

21:28.633 --> 21:30.400
Uh, a lot.

21:30.433 --> 21:31.466
Well, I don’t know
how you did it

21:31.500 --> 21:33.266
but you brought in a big story.

21:33.300 --> 21:37.066
Maybe I should think about
making this team permanent. Hm.

21:39.300 --> 21:41.100
Permanent?

21:41.133 --> 21:42.633
‐Did you hear that?
‐Yes.

21:42.666 --> 21:45.033
He’s going to do our hair.

21:50.833 --> 21:52.400
Yes, that’s right.

21:54.733 --> 21:58.033
Well, Balki,
it looks like our careers

21:58.066 --> 21:59.400
are starting to take off.

21:59.433 --> 22:00.500
This is a big day for me.

22:00.533 --> 22:03.500
‐Well, it’s a big night, too.
‐What do you mean?

22:03.533 --> 22:08.033
Well, you go to work
at the hospital tonight.

22:08.066 --> 22:09.133
You got your interview.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.366
And now you have to pay
Peter Piper.

22:11.400 --> 22:14.266
Hey, I’m happy to do it.

22:14.300 --> 22:15.700
Well, that’s a good attitude.

22:15.733 --> 22:19.766
Now, what would you like to do
for the first three months

22:19.800 --> 22:23.400
mash down garbage
or work on the third floor?

22:24.700 --> 22:27.633
Ooh, that’s a toughie.

22:27.666 --> 22:28.800
I’ll take the third floor.

22:28.833 --> 22:31.133
Bedpans it is.

22:32.833 --> 22:36.000
