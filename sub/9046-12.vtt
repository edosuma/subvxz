00:00.278 --> 00:02.078
Previously, on <i>Awkward...</i>

00:02.080 --> 00:03.346
Friend or foe?

00:03.348 --> 00:06.814
So, you need to choose.
Him or me?

00:06.817 --> 00:08.885
So, when it came to the boys,

00:08.887 --> 00:11.988
if a do-over wasn't an option,
maybe a start-over was.

00:11.990 --> 00:13.990
And I finally knew
who it would be with.

00:16.059 --> 00:17.393
Spin the bottle.

00:17.395 --> 00:18.862
It was a requisite
rite of passage.

00:18.864 --> 00:20.964
And while I was
past my prime to play,

00:20.966 --> 00:22.599
it seemed fitting,

00:22.601 --> 00:27.804
given all the spiraling
I'd done throughout the year.

00:27.806 --> 00:29.706
I'm gonna take a pass.

00:29.708 --> 00:31.374
I knew you'd be out.

00:31.376 --> 00:33.543
You're right.
I'm not into bears.

00:33.545 --> 00:35.545
But I will make out
with your boyfriend.

00:35.547 --> 00:37.881
Good luck with that.

00:37.883 --> 00:40.116
Pass equals drink.

00:43.453 --> 00:48.190
In the game, all decisions
were left to the bottle.

00:53.463 --> 00:57.033
And for once, the bottle
was more fickle than I was.

00:57.035 --> 01:01.404
You can choose or spin again.

01:01.406 --> 01:02.705
Spin again.

01:02.707 --> 01:05.474
The bottle didn't know
what I wanted, but I did.

01:05.476 --> 01:07.544
Despite already
having made a decision...

01:07.546 --> 01:08.545
Bottle flip!

01:08.547 --> 01:12.715
Seven minutes in heaven
for you two.

01:12.717 --> 01:14.116
I was still in the closet.

01:14.518 --> 01:17.719
- So what should we do?
- Put on a show.

01:17.721 --> 01:20.889
- Mm, yeah, baby.
- Oh, yeah. Oh--

01:22.427 --> 01:27.263
You don't have to fake it.
I know you're together now.

01:27.265 --> 01:29.665
It's cool.

01:29.667 --> 01:32.301
- I told him.
- I was going to.

01:32.303 --> 01:33.669
You snooze, you lose.

01:33.671 --> 01:35.838
With Jake getting
the answer he needed,

01:35.840 --> 01:38.307
Matty was clear to be
with the girl he wanted.

01:38.309 --> 01:39.741
Me.

01:39.743 --> 01:42.878
So I made use of my last
three minutes of seven...

01:42.880 --> 01:44.213
in heaven.

01:47.618 --> 01:51.787
Sophomore summer abroad.
We have to go.

01:51.789 --> 01:53.489
This year has been
crap-tastic, suck-drastic,

01:53.491 --> 01:56.092
but if we go to Europe,
I can save my summer.

01:56.094 --> 01:57.894
How are we gonna pay for it?

01:57.896 --> 01:59.395
Panties.

01:59.397 --> 02:00.930
You can sell your dirty ones
to businessmen abroad.

02:00.932 --> 02:04.633
How do you think the mafia
affords so much sushi?

02:04.635 --> 02:06.068
They're a major distributor.

02:06.070 --> 02:08.871
Have you sold
your underwonders?

02:08.872 --> 02:10.406
No comment.

02:10.407 --> 02:11.540
I'm not selling my underwear.

02:11.542 --> 02:12.875
Even if it means
I'm stuck here.

02:12.877 --> 02:14.310
You're not stuck

02:14.312 --> 02:15.744
if you're about to have
a real boyfriend summer.

02:15.746 --> 02:18.180
The other shoe is poised
to drop at any moment.

02:18.182 --> 02:20.283
Remember,
all good things in my life

02:20.285 --> 02:22.451
are closely followed
by something bad.

02:22.453 --> 02:24.620
Dare you forget,
Matty and I haven't DTRed.

02:24.622 --> 02:28.590
Oh, tell me we're not gonna be
obsessing over that again.

02:28.592 --> 02:31.027
Hey.

02:31.029 --> 02:34.130
Apparently, our BF-GF status
didn't need words to define it.

02:34.132 --> 02:35.731
Will my girlfriend
give me a bit?

02:35.733 --> 02:39.201
Or "girlfriend"
would roll off Matty's tongue

02:39.203 --> 02:40.602
and onto my salami.

02:40.604 --> 02:43.839
Hitting the courts.
See you later?

02:43.841 --> 02:47.410
You have everything.

02:47.412 --> 02:49.812
And all I have
is a text from my ex.

02:49.814 --> 02:51.580
Ricky is sniffing me out.
There's trouble in paradise.

02:51.582 --> 02:54.150
- Once a cheater, always a cheater.
- Cheater!

02:54.152 --> 02:56.652
He's been texting that troll!

02:56.654 --> 02:58.387
If he cheated,
he would have deleted.

02:58.389 --> 03:00.022
But he will cheat
if you don't confront him.

03:00.024 --> 03:03.225
And let him know I'm snooping?
That's really smart.

03:03.227 --> 03:04.961
Thank you.

03:04.963 --> 03:08.297
I think he's avoiding me.
I need to shake things up.

03:08.299 --> 03:10.166
No, you need to do
what you always do.

03:10.168 --> 03:11.700
Put him in his place.

03:11.702 --> 03:14.903
Don't tell me how to do
what I do, birdbrain.

03:14.905 --> 03:17.239
Exactly. Just like that.

03:21.045 --> 03:23.745
Hello, this I--
Ricky.

03:23.747 --> 03:27.683
Yes, I am answering your phone,
because you left it in my car.

03:27.685 --> 03:29.285
But--

03:29.287 --> 03:31.320
Since I haven't
seen you for two days,

03:31.322 --> 03:33.389
I haven't been able
to give it back to you.

03:33.391 --> 03:34.923
Do you miss me?
'Cause I miss you.

03:36.461 --> 03:38.560
All. The. Time.

03:38.562 --> 03:40.062
Sure.

03:40.064 --> 03:41.430
I can give the phone to Rob

03:41.432 --> 03:43.165
to give to Marty
to give back to you.

03:43.167 --> 03:47.136
And then you can
call me, beefcake.

03:47.138 --> 03:49.938
No.
"Call me, comma, beefcake."

03:49.940 --> 03:53.342
You're the beefcake.

03:53.344 --> 03:56.778
I love you, babe.

03:56.780 --> 03:58.747
God, why do exes
always have to creep back?

03:58.749 --> 04:00.649
But did all exes creep back?

04:00.651 --> 04:03.552
And could they
creep back as friends?

04:03.554 --> 04:05.154
Jake and I haven't
really talked,

04:05.156 --> 04:08.224
and even though he says
he's cool, I don't think he is.

04:08.226 --> 04:10.459
He looks pretty cool to me.

04:10.461 --> 04:11.894
It's a front.

04:12.396 --> 04:14.563
None of those skanks
are up to par.

04:14.565 --> 04:15.564
So who is?

04:15.566 --> 04:17.533
A girl with substance.

04:17.535 --> 04:18.800
Like T.

04:18.802 --> 04:22.004
He couldn't handle me.

04:22.005 --> 04:24.272
I'm a lot of woman.

04:24.274 --> 04:26.274
And if I wanted Jake
to be my friend,

04:26.276 --> 04:28.610
I needed to be a woman
and man up.

04:28.612 --> 04:33.549
Thanks.

04:33.551 --> 04:37.819
See you guys.

04:40.256 --> 04:41.356
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:41.358 --> 04:42.958
Crazy seeing you here.

04:42.960 --> 04:44.626
In the school hallway?

04:44.628 --> 04:46.895
No, I-I meant
on this route to class.

04:46.897 --> 04:48.063
I go this way every day.

04:48.065 --> 04:50.498
Me too.
That is so weird.

04:50.500 --> 04:52.034
This is weird.

04:52.036 --> 04:53.969
Do you feel weird?
'Cause I'm acting weird.

04:53.971 --> 04:56.104
- I just--
- Don't.

04:56.106 --> 04:58.006
When I said I'd be fine
with your decision, I meant it.

04:58.008 --> 04:59.207
Might not have been
what I wanted,

04:59.209 --> 05:01.276
but hey, it's what I needed.

05:01.278 --> 05:02.978
Really?

05:02.980 --> 05:03.979
Jenna, I've been
a serial monogamist

05:03.981 --> 05:05.647
since the fifth grade.

05:05.649 --> 05:07.382
To be honest, I haven't seen
this much action since I was 10.

05:07.384 --> 05:08.917
Don't get me wrong.

05:08.919 --> 05:10.886
You set the bar really high.

05:10.888 --> 05:13.488
And it's gonna be a while till
I meet someone like you again.

05:13.490 --> 05:15.290
But until then...

05:15.292 --> 05:20.161
Don't hate the player,
hate the game.

05:21.397 --> 05:23.098
Well, ladies...

05:23.100 --> 05:26.267
For once, the universe was
actually working in my favor.

05:26.269 --> 05:28.737
Which was not
cause for celebration.

05:28.739 --> 05:30.472
It was setting off alarms.
I was...

05:30.474 --> 05:33.241
Jenna Hamilton,
please report to the office.

05:33.243 --> 05:35.777
Thankfully,
on my way to a problem.

05:35.779 --> 05:38.546
I am really,
really disappointed in you.

05:38.548 --> 05:40.048
You're being selfish.

05:40.050 --> 05:43.485
You need to work out your issues
and get back together.

05:43.487 --> 05:44.820
- We are back together.
- We are back together.

05:44.822 --> 05:45.954
Damn, I'm good!

05:45.956 --> 05:48.256
Uh! Double up. Uh, uh!

05:50.794 --> 05:53.795
J. We're having
a family meeting.

05:53.797 --> 05:55.163
Finally,
something bad would happen

05:55.165 --> 05:57.165
so I could get on with my day.

05:57.167 --> 05:58.834
Closer.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.537
Let's get closer.

06:02.539 --> 06:05.941
I asked our folks here to have
a little state of the union.

06:05.943 --> 06:08.810
And it appears that the union
is back intact.

06:08.812 --> 06:09.978
Is that true?

06:09.980 --> 06:11.446
- Yes.
- Good.

06:11.448 --> 06:14.149
Now, I think the only way

06:14.151 --> 06:18.987
that you can atone
for the hell you put us through

06:18.989 --> 06:22.357
is to send Jenna
on the Europe trip with me.

06:22.359 --> 06:23.458
Her sista...

06:23.460 --> 06:25.761
Slash-chaperone.

06:25.763 --> 06:28.196
- That sounds fantastic!
- But...

06:28.198 --> 06:29.965
- Oh! But...
- We can't.

06:29.967 --> 06:31.867
Money's a little tight
right now.

06:31.869 --> 06:33.535
And whose fault is that?

06:33.537 --> 06:36.371
Yet again, dad, you're operating
from a selfish place.

06:36.373 --> 06:39.440
Can't you just cash out
some of your retirement fund?

06:39.442 --> 06:40.942
I mean, what good is that money
when you're old?

06:40.944 --> 06:43.145
I don't need to go.

06:43.147 --> 06:45.313
I'm just happy that my parents
are back together.

06:45.315 --> 06:46.414
Just amazing.

06:46.416 --> 06:49.217
Now, this is what
I call selflessness.

06:49.219 --> 06:52.921
How 'bout we think
about the trip?

06:52.923 --> 06:56.658
That is acceptable.
Meeting adjourned.

06:56.660 --> 06:58.960
Okay.

07:01.463 --> 07:03.131
Isn't there a problem
I need to address?

07:03.133 --> 07:05.400
Nope.
Just have a good day.

07:05.402 --> 07:06.835
That was the problem.

07:06.837 --> 07:11.740
I needed a problem
to have a good day.

07:11.742 --> 07:12.808
Everything is perfect.

07:12.810 --> 07:14.710
Maybe too perfect.

07:14.712 --> 07:16.277
Something bad
is bound to happen.

07:16.279 --> 07:18.246
- Mm, not possible.
- Possible.

07:18.248 --> 07:20.182
If you haven't noticed,
I'm a walking disaster zone.

07:20.184 --> 07:24.219
This summer is gonna be
the best summer of our lives.

07:24.221 --> 07:28.289
Just you, me, and Camp Puka.

07:28.291 --> 07:29.858
We're gonna get paid,
and you're gonna get laid.

07:29.860 --> 07:31.426
Don't get ahead of yourself.

07:31.428 --> 07:33.261
I don't want to get ahead,
I want to get on top.

07:33.263 --> 07:34.930
I was being neurotic.

07:34.932 --> 07:37.032
The other shoe
didn't need to drop

07:37.034 --> 07:38.499
for me to get
everything I wanted,

07:38.501 --> 07:41.803
which involved more of McKibben
and less of his clothes.

07:41.805 --> 07:44.472
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

07:44.474 --> 07:45.974
Ever heard of a knock?

07:45.976 --> 07:49.044
We couldn't wait.
We had to tell you that...

07:49.046 --> 07:50.345
we're sending you to Europe!

07:50.347 --> 07:53.148
You're signed, sealed,
and paid for.

07:53.150 --> 07:57.219
So I wasn't neurotic.
I was intuitive.

07:57.221 --> 08:01.056
The other shoe
had definitely dropped,

08:01.058 --> 08:02.523
but it wasn't
a sweaty converse.

08:02.525 --> 08:04.893
It was a sparkly
Manolo Blahnik.

08:06.212 --> 08:08.380
- Europe.
- Europe.

08:10.117 --> 08:15.053
We are gonna have so much fun
when we take in the sights,

08:15.055 --> 08:16.455
because we are going
on an adventure.

08:16.457 --> 08:18.357
We are getting
ahead of ourselves.

08:18.359 --> 08:20.325
Why?

08:20.827 --> 08:23.528
Because the "we" that is me
has already committed to camp.

08:23.530 --> 08:25.897
- You can get out of it.
- I could, but...

08:25.899 --> 08:27.131
I don't want to.

08:27.133 --> 08:28.867
I'm gonna be a head counselor.

08:28.869 --> 08:30.401
But that doesn't mean
you can't go.

08:30.403 --> 08:32.971
I can't go unless you go.

08:32.972 --> 08:34.572
That's not true.

08:34.573 --> 08:35.673
It's six weeks.

08:35.674 --> 08:37.475
It'll be over
before you know it.

08:37.477 --> 08:39.376
"It'll be over
before you know it?"

08:39.379 --> 08:41.044
What does that even mean?

08:41.047 --> 08:42.413
Stop being paranoid
and get amped!

08:42.414 --> 08:44.448
We're going to Europe!

08:44.450 --> 08:46.584
- You got the green light?
- The light isn't just green.

08:46.586 --> 08:47.852
It's neon.

08:47.854 --> 08:49.821
I walked in on my mom making out
with her friend Claire.

08:49.823 --> 08:51.188
Your mom's gay?

08:51.190 --> 08:52.423
No, she's a lesbutante.

08:52.425 --> 08:54.058
She keeps it strictly
above the belt.

08:54.060 --> 08:55.960
But it was a TS sitch, so my
mom is letting me go on the trip

08:55.962 --> 08:57.562
to keep me
from telling my grandma.

08:57.564 --> 09:00.965
Little does she know
I'm totes equal opportunity.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.266
O-M-G.

09:02.268 --> 09:04.636
- I have it. Problem solved.
- Well, tell me.

09:04.638 --> 09:06.137
With all my mom's
guilt tripping,

09:06.139 --> 09:07.805
I bet I could swing
a euro trash bash.

09:07.807 --> 09:09.407
We'll show McKibben

09:09.409 --> 09:11.709
just how much he'll be livin'
if he comes with!

09:11.711 --> 09:12.911
I don't want to manipulate him.

09:12.913 --> 09:14.111
It's not manipulation.

09:14.113 --> 09:17.649
It's coercion.
Think about it.

09:19.586 --> 09:22.020
I was stuck with the hiccups.

09:22.022 --> 09:23.555
An annoying series
of convulsions

09:23.557 --> 09:26.257
disrupting the blood flow
from my heart to my head.

09:26.259 --> 09:28.159
I wanted to go to Europe.

09:28.161 --> 09:30.628
And yet, I was afraid
to go without Matty.

09:30.630 --> 09:32.697
So there was only
one thing left to consider.

09:32.699 --> 09:35.934
You really want to know
what I think?

09:35.936 --> 09:37.468
Yes.

09:37.470 --> 09:39.571
I knew my mom would tell me
what I wanted to hear.

09:39.573 --> 09:41.405
Stay with the--
Go to Europe.

09:41.407 --> 09:43.975
Come on, when you were my age,
you would've picked Matty.

09:43.977 --> 09:47.378
- 100%.
- I rest my case.

09:47.380 --> 09:49.313
Jenna, I'm not
the best role model.

09:49.315 --> 09:51.482
That was a given.

09:51.484 --> 09:53.350
Back in the day,
when I was with Ben,

09:53.352 --> 09:55.119
I had so many opportunities

09:55.121 --> 09:57.589
to do things
that I really wanted to do,

09:57.591 --> 09:59.691
but I didn't do them
because he didn't want to.

09:59.693 --> 10:01.960
Like what?

10:01.962 --> 10:03.427
Camping.

10:03.429 --> 10:07.264
- Mom, you are not a camper.
- Who knows? I might be.

10:07.266 --> 10:10.068
I do own a battery-operated
curling iron.

10:10.470 --> 10:12.169
And there were so many times

10:12.171 --> 10:15.206
that I never got to dance
'cause Ben didn't like to.

10:15.208 --> 10:16.573
I just sat on his lap,

10:16.575 --> 10:18.275
and watched everyone
around me having fun.

10:18.277 --> 10:22.346
Is that why you chose dad?
For his white man's overbite?

10:22.348 --> 10:25.016
Yes.

10:25.018 --> 10:28.252
And someday,
he will bust it out for me

10:28.254 --> 10:31.855
on a dance floor in Europe.

10:31.857 --> 10:34.992
But until we get that chance,

10:34.994 --> 10:37.028
we really want you to have it.

10:37.030 --> 10:40.864
Surprisingly,
my mom was giving good advice.

10:40.866 --> 10:43.100
Which left me
with one last resort.

10:43.102 --> 10:44.201
Manipulation.

10:44.203 --> 10:47.738
And this is the last stop
on our tour.

10:47.740 --> 10:49.507
Italy.

10:49.509 --> 10:51.842
A country full of pasta
and passion.

10:51.844 --> 10:53.244
Does that mean I could
eat pizza off your chest?

10:53.246 --> 10:56.514
If you go to Europe.

10:56.516 --> 10:59.050
I'm gonna bump uglies tonight!

10:59.052 --> 11:00.617
Code red.
She is wasted.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.586
I better help T.

11:02.588 --> 11:07.425
Meet you in Paris?

11:07.427 --> 11:09.493
How much have you had to drink?

11:09.495 --> 11:10.494
A...

11:10.496 --> 11:11.962
lot.

11:11.964 --> 11:15.433
'Cause tonight,
I'm breaking all the rules.

11:15.435 --> 11:17.868
And my hymen.

11:17.870 --> 11:21.004
I'm ready for Freddy
to get sweaty.

11:21.006 --> 11:23.340
Head to Amsterdam
and get a condom.

11:23.342 --> 11:25.376
Oh...

11:25.378 --> 11:27.311
She needs to sober up.

11:27.313 --> 11:28.912
With a cold shower.

11:28.914 --> 11:30.514
I'll take care of it.
You just keep hammering Matty.

11:30.516 --> 11:32.216
Actually,
I think he's warming up.

11:32.218 --> 11:34.718
Ricky is still being cold, and
he's been avoiding me all night.

11:34.720 --> 11:36.220
What should I do?

11:36.222 --> 11:38.122
Why are you asking me?
You don't want my opinion.

11:38.124 --> 11:41.892
Desperate times
call for desperate measures.

11:41.894 --> 11:43.461
Get really drunk,
so you throw up,

11:43.463 --> 11:44.428
and he has to
hold your hair back.

11:44.430 --> 11:45.862
Boys like to feel needed.

11:45.864 --> 11:47.531
Boys like to watch
getting blown,

11:47.533 --> 11:49.233
not the blowing of chunks.

11:49.235 --> 11:50.501
Then take your own advice.

11:50.503 --> 11:52.503
Make him an offer
he can't refuse.

11:52.505 --> 11:53.504
Like what?

11:53.506 --> 11:55.038

- What'd she say?
- "Let's hook up."

12:07.653 --> 12:09.987
I don't know what happened,
but all of a sudden, I'm you.

12:09.989 --> 12:11.922

grabbed my johnson.

12:14.627 --> 12:16.660
I was peeing.

going to Europe.
