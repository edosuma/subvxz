WEBVTT

00:07.888 --> 00:10.430
Joey: "MELISSA & JOEY" IS RECORDED
IN FRONT OF A LIVE STUDIO AUDIENCE.

00:10.431 --> 00:12.392
( door opens )

00:12.393 --> 00:14.934
JOE, THE BLOOD AND GUTS
ON THE FRONT PORCH

00:14.935 --> 00:16.226
LOOK DISGUSTING!

00:16.227 --> 00:18.978
GREAT JOB!

00:18.979 --> 00:21.191
THANK YOU, HONEY. AND I'VE ACTUALLY
SAVED MY MOST TRAUMATIZING WORK

00:21.192 --> 00:23.483
FOR RIGHT HERE IN THIS LIVING ROOM,
BECAUSE UNDERNEATH THOSE SHEETS,

00:23.484 --> 00:26.446
I AM BUILDING THE
MOST BLOOD-CURDLING,

00:26.447 --> 00:28.988
TERRIFYING MECHANICAL MONSTER
THIS NEIGHBORHOOD...

00:28.989 --> 00:32.362
NO, ACTUALLY ALL OF NORTHEAST
TOLEDO, HAS EVER SEEN.

00:32.363 --> 00:34.494
MM-HMM. IS THIS ABOUT
THOSE KIDS LAST YEAR

00:34.495 --> 00:36.916
THAT LOOKED AT YOUR
DECORATIONS AND WENT, "YO,

00:36.917 --> 00:38.998
CHECK OUT THE DOUCHE-O-LANTERN"?

00:38.999 --> 00:40.580
I DON'T CARE WHAT THOSE
KIDS THINK, ALL RIGHT?

00:40.581 --> 00:41.871
AND AFTER THEY SEE
WHAT'S UNDER THERE,

00:41.872 --> 00:43.333
THIS YEAR THEY'LL BE
PEEING IN THEIR PANTS.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.044
OH, GOOD, THAT'S JUST WHAT THE
FRONT PORCH IS MISSING...

00:45.045 --> 00:47.127
THE PUNGENT SCENT OF FEAR PEE.

00:47.128 --> 00:50.760
SO WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO UNVEIL
THIS SUPER-SCARY CREATION OF YOURS?

00:50.761 --> 00:52.262
DON'T... DON'T SAY IT LIKE THAT.

00:52.263 --> 00:54.514
- SAY WHAT LIKE WHAT?
- ( high voice ) "SUPER SCARY."

00:54.515 --> 00:56.556
LIKE, YOU JUST PUT
QUOTES AROUND IT,

00:56.557 --> 00:58.638
LIKE YOU DON'T THINK I CAN
ACTUALLY SCARE PEOPLE.

00:58.639 --> 00:59.939
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
CAN SCARE PEOPLE.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.812
I'VE SEEN YOU TALK TO
SMOKERS IN RESTAURANTS.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.984
SO WHEN DO I GET TO
LOOK UNDER THAT?

01:04.985 --> 01:08.027
ALL RIGHT, OKAY.
STAND OVER HERE.

01:08.028 --> 01:10.860
READY? MEET...

01:10.861 --> 01:13.193
SCARY LARRY. HUH?!

01:13.194 --> 01:14.994
OKAY, HOLD ON, HOLD ON, HOLD ON.

01:14.995 --> 01:16.826
PREPARE TO BE TERRIFIED.

01:16.827 --> 01:21.161
( deep voice ) I'M GOING TO...

01:21.162 --> 01:22.543
( whirring )

01:24.465 --> 01:26.916
WHAT? YOU'RE GONNA WHAT?

01:26.917 --> 01:31.261
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT, JOE. THE
SUSPENSE IS TERRIFYING.

01:31.262 --> 01:35.925
"I'M GONNA HACK YOU TO BITS." THE HATCHET'S
SUPPOSED TO GO UP AND THEN SWOOSH DOWN.

01:35.926 --> 01:37.767
BATTERIES MUST BE DEAD.

01:37.768 --> 01:41.271
WELL, MAYBE NEXT TIME YOU
SHOULD GET UNDEAD BATTERIES.

01:41.272 --> 01:44.484
( girl screaming )

01:44.485 --> 01:46.316
LIKE THAT DOORBELL, DON'T YOU?

01:46.317 --> 01:48.859
I LOVE THE DOORBELL!

01:52.943 --> 01:55.325
DR. RADLER.

01:55.326 --> 01:56.946
HELLO, MEL.

01:56.947 --> 02:00.290
UH, JOE, THIS IS DR.
RADLER, MY GYNECOLOGIST,

02:00.291 --> 02:02.121
WHO'S HERE AT OUR HOUSE
FOR SOME REASON.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.083
- NICE TO MEET YOU.
- YEAH, SAME HERE.

02:04.084 --> 02:05.875
OH, I'M SORRY. DON'T
MIND THE HATCHET.

02:05.876 --> 02:07.957
I'M ACTUALLY JUST HOLDING
IT FOR A FRIEND.

02:07.958 --> 02:09.549
SO WHY THE HOUSE CALL?

02:09.550 --> 02:10.960
YEAH, IS MEL OKAY?

02:10.961 --> 02:13.052
OH, YES, IT'S NOTHING
TO WORRY ABOUT.

02:13.053 --> 02:15.054
IT'S NOT A PROFESSIONAL CALL,

02:15.055 --> 02:17.427
JUST A LITTLE CATCH-UP
BETWEEN WOMEN.

02:17.428 --> 02:20.970
JUST BECAUSE I'VE SEEN YOUR CERVIX
DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN'T BE FRIENDS.

02:20.971 --> 02:24.564
JUST TO BE CLEAR, I DON'T
NEED TO SEE YOUR CERVIX

02:24.565 --> 02:26.856
IN ORDER TO BE FRIENDS.

02:26.857 --> 02:29.569
I'M GONNA GET OUT OF HERE BEFORE
THIS CONVERSATION GETS WEIRD...

02:29.570 --> 02:30.771
IT'S TOO LATE, THOUGH.

02:32.483 --> 02:33.903
( door opens )

02:33.904 --> 02:35.655
MEL, IT'S TIME YOU KNEW...

02:35.656 --> 02:37.777
I'M NOT A REAL GYNECOLOGIST.

02:37.778 --> 02:39.699
WHAT?! WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT WAIT.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.991
SO THAT WASN'T
ACTUALLY AN I.U.D.?

02:41.992 --> 02:44.454
- THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT.
- I BEG TO DIFFER!

02:44.455 --> 02:47.337
I'VE BEEN WATCHING OVER
YOU IN VARIOUS GUISES

02:47.338 --> 02:48.918
EVER SINCE YOU WERE A TEENAGER.

02:48.919 --> 02:51.421
BUT NOW IT'S TIME
YOU KNEW THE TRUTH.

02:51.422 --> 02:56.347
MEL BURKE, YOU ARE A GREAT
AND POWERFUL WITCH.

02:58.058 --> 02:59.930
ME?

03:02.803 --> 03:07.017
♪ I GUESS YOU'RE STUCK WITH ME ♪

03:10.811 --> 03:12.812
I'M A WITCH? LIKE A WITCH WITCH?

03:12.813 --> 03:16.526
LIKE, "CACKLE CACKLE, RIDING ON A
BROOMSTICK, WARTS ON THE NOSE"?

03:16.527 --> 03:20.620
WELL, NOWADAYS, MOST WITCHES HAVE
WART-REDUCTION SURGERY, BUT YES.

03:20.621 --> 03:22.622
YOU ARE A POWERFUL WITCH.

03:22.623 --> 03:26.085
THE ADVENTURES OF YOUR YOUTH ARE
RETOLD TIME AND TIME AGAIN,

03:26.086 --> 03:28.958
MOSTLY ON SATURDAY AFTERNOONS.

03:28.959 --> 03:31.791
OH, I GET IT. THIS IS SOME
KIND OF HALLOWEEN PRANK.

03:31.792 --> 03:33.633
MEL, THIS IS NO PRANK.

03:33.634 --> 03:36.215
AS A TEENAGE GIRL, YOU GREW
UP IN THE WITCH WORLD,

03:36.216 --> 03:37.837
THE OTHER REALM.

03:37.838 --> 03:40.680
YOU GREW UP UNDER MY CARE.
I'M A WITCH TOO.

03:40.681 --> 03:41.891
I'M 300 YEARS OLD.

03:41.892 --> 03:45.685
WELL, YOU LOOK FANTASTIC.

03:45.686 --> 03:47.937
I MOISTURIZE.

03:47.938 --> 03:51.561
BUT LET'S NOT TALK ABOUT
HOW BEAUTIFUL I AM.

03:51.562 --> 03:55.445
YEARS AGO, A DARK FORCE
INFILTRATED OUR WORLD.

03:55.446 --> 03:57.947
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, WE
ERASED YOUR MEMORIES

03:57.948 --> 04:00.910
AND PLACED YOU HERE IN
UNASSUMING TOLEDO, OHIO

04:00.911 --> 04:03.032

04:03.033 --> 04:05.495
AN AVERAGE MIDWESTERN WOMAN.

04:05.496 --> 04:08.167
AVERAGE? HAVE YOU SEEN ME
RUN DOWNSTAIRS IN HEELS?

04:08.168 --> 04:09.999
I'M AMAZING.

04:10.000 --> 04:12.832
BUT NOW YOU AND YOUR
POWERS ARE NEEDED

04:12.833 --> 04:15.585
FOR EVIL HAS OVERTAKEN
THE OTHER REALM.

04:15.586 --> 04:19.008
THE DARK LORD HAS RISEN
AND CHAOS REIGNS.

04:19.009 --> 04:22.512
DR. RADLER, HONEY,

CRAZY PANTS TO YOU?

04:37.858 --> 04:42.492
NO, THIS SPARKLY CELL PHONE MAKES

04:45.366 --> 04:47.867

04:47.868 --> 04:51.372
USE THIS APP TO OPEN THE
eBOOK OF INCANTATIONS.

04:53.003 --> 04:55.915
READ IT THOROUGHLY, FOR IT
CAN SAVE YOUR VERY LIFE.

04:55.916 --> 04:58.758
MEL? UH...

04:58.759 --> 05:01.971

JOE, I'M KIND OF DEALING WITH A
VERY IMPORTANT HOUSE CALL HERE.

05:08.889 --> 05:11.020
SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION, DR.
RAD...

05:11.021 --> 05:12.732
WHERE DID SHE GO?!

05:12.733 --> 05:15.435
- DR. RADLER WAS JUST HERE!
- SHE'S NOT HERE NOW.

05:15.436 --> 05:17.647
( sighs ) SHE JUST TOLD ME
THE MOST BIZARRE THING.

05:17.648 --> 05:20.940
APPARENTLY, I'M A WITCH AND I'M
NEEDED TO SAVE THE OTHER REALM.

05:20.941 --> 05:22.782
A WITCH, HUH? MMM!

05:22.783 --> 05:24.654
ARE YOU GOOD WITCH
OR A BAD WITCH?

05:24.655 --> 05:26.325
YOU KNOW, SHE DIDN'T SAY.

05:26.326 --> 05:30.159
YEAH? WELL, I HOPE
YOU'RE A BAD BAD WITCH.

05:30.160 --> 05:32.001
WHERE'D YOU GET THE
NEW CELL PHONE?

05:32.002 --> 05:34.954
DR. RADLER GAVE IT TO ME. IT'S
A BOOK OF SPELLS, APPARENTLY.

05:34.955 --> 05:39.008
YOU KNOW, YOU MIGHT WANT TO LOOK
AROUND FOR A NEW GYNECOLOGIST.

05:39.009 --> 05:40.009
LOOK, HONEY, I GOT
TO GO TO THE STORE,

05:40.010 --> 05:41.671
GOTTA PICK UP SOME
MORE BATTERIES,

05:41.672 --> 05:43.963
GET SCARY LARRY WORKING HERE BEFORE
THE KIDS START TO TRICK-OR-TREAT.

05:43.964 --> 05:46.466
- YOU NEED ANYTHING?
- BETTER CANDY THAN YOU USUALLY GET?

05:46.467 --> 05:48.888
RAISINS ARE NATURE'S CANDY!

05:48.889 --> 05:51.852
AND THAT'S WHY PEOPLE THROW
NATURE'S EGGS AT OUR DOOR!

05:54.024 --> 05:56.025
( beeping )

05:56.026 --> 05:57.937
Female voice: Hello, Mel.

05:57.938 --> 05:59.739
Are you ready to cast a spell?

05:59.740 --> 06:02.321
WOW, DR. RADLER WENT ALL OUT!

06:02.322 --> 06:05.615
OKAY, I CAN PLAY ALONG
WITH THE DOCTOR'S JOKE.

06:05.616 --> 06:07.787
UM, LEVITATE THE COUCH.

06:07.788 --> 06:09.789
Your spell will
not be successful

06:09.790 --> 06:11.871
without the proper
intention and gesture.

06:11.872 --> 06:13.913
OH JEEZ. OKAY.

06:13.914 --> 06:15.546
LEVITATE, COUCH!

06:17.087 --> 06:18.878
Gesture poor.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.920
Intention level, weak.

06:20.921 --> 06:23.052
MAYBE I'M GETTING A BAD SIGNAL.

06:23.053 --> 06:25.595
THIS MIGHT BE A LOUSY
WITCH-COVERAGE AREA.

06:25.596 --> 06:27.848
OH, YEAH, I'VE ONLY
GOT TWO BROOMS.

06:29.560 --> 06:32.432
OOOOH!

06:32.433 --> 06:35.354
OH, RYDER, NICE COSTUME.

06:35.355 --> 06:38.277
YOU'RE ROCKIN' HALLOWEEN
OLD-SCHOOL "PEANUTS" STYLE.

06:38.278 --> 06:39.819
WHERE ARE YOU TWO HEADED?

06:39.820 --> 06:42.692
OOOOOH!

06:42.693 --> 06:44.694
RYDER SAID HE'S NOT SPEAKING
UNTIL AFTER HE GETS BACK

06:44.695 --> 06:45.785
FROM THIS PARTY WE'RE GOING TO.

06:45.786 --> 06:47.827
HE'S VERY COMMITTED
TO HIS CHARACTER.

06:47.828 --> 06:49.910
OOOH!

06:51.872 --> 06:53.793
THAT IS SO SWEET...
WAIT A SECOND.

06:53.794 --> 06:56.165
WERE THOSE MY
1,000-THREAD-COUNT SHEETS?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.878
YOU KNOW WHAT? HE IS GOING TO
BE A GHOST WHEN HE GETS HOME.

06:58.879 --> 07:02.001
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY COSTUME?

07:02.002 --> 07:03.963
OH, YEAH, IT'S GREAT.

07:03.964 --> 07:06.846
- WHAT ARE YOU?
- YOU CAN'T TELL?

07:06.847 --> 07:08.307
UH, DON'T GIVE ME THE EYEBROW.

07:08.308 --> 07:09.639
OKAY, I'M REALLY TRYING HERE.

07:09.640 --> 07:12.602
UM, OH! I GOT IT.
YOU'RE A RAT PRINCESS.

07:12.603 --> 07:16.105
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE A SEXY CAT!

07:16.106 --> 07:19.479
- OH, NOW I SEE IT.
- NO, YOU DON'T.

07:19.480 --> 07:21.651
UGH! STUPID CHEAP
MAIL-ORDER COSTUME.

07:21.652 --> 07:23.863
IT'S NOT SEXY AND
IT'S BARELY A CAT.

07:23.864 --> 07:25.194
HONEY, YOU LOOK VERY NICE.

07:25.195 --> 07:26.616
I DO NOT!

07:26.617 --> 07:28.988
UH! YOU DON'T REALLY
CARE, DO YOU?

07:28.989 --> 07:30.870
OF COURSE I CARE, SWEETHEART.

07:30.871 --> 07:32.161
I CARE A GREAT DEAL.

07:32.162 --> 07:34.874
I MEAN, I WANT YOU TO BE THE MOST
REALISTIC CAT THERE EVER WAS!

07:34.875 --> 07:37.537
Lennox's voice: OH MY GOD!

07:37.538 --> 07:39.288
WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

07:39.289 --> 07:41.130
I DON'T KNOW.

07:41.131 --> 07:43.963
- UNDO! UNDO!
- ( phone beeping )

07:43.964 --> 07:45.385
CONTROL Z!

07:50.390 --> 07:51.971
Lennox: HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?

07:51.972 --> 07:53.853
HOW THE HELL DID YOU
TURN ME INTO A CAT?

07:53.854 --> 07:55.014
I DON'T KNOW!

07:55.015 --> 07:57.937
APPARENTLY I HAD THE PROPER
INTENTION AND GESTURE.

07:57.938 --> 07:59.689
WHAT ARE YOU, SOME
KIND OF MAGICIAN?

07:59.690 --> 08:00.810
NO, I'M A...

08:00.811 --> 08:03.152
A WITCH!

08:03.153 --> 08:05.985
THEN DO WHATEVER THAT WAS AGAIN
AND CHANGE ME BACK RIGHT NOW.

08:05.986 --> 08:07.737
I HAVE A PARTY TO GO TO TONIGHT.

08:07.738 --> 08:09.989
ALL RIGHT, DON'T WORRY, OKAY?
I'M GONNA CHANGE YOU BACK.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.490
OH, YOU'RE SO SOFT!

08:11.491 --> 08:14.824
OKAY, I JUST HAVE TO FIND THE
RIGHT SPELL TO TRANSFORM YOU.

08:14.825 --> 08:16.826
OH, NO, I HAVE TO
GO TO THE BATHROOM.

08:16.827 --> 08:18.878
WHAT? NO NO NO! WE DON'T
HAVE A LITTER BOX.

08:18.879 --> 08:20.329
THEN LET ME OUTSIDE.

08:20.330 --> 08:22.461
WELL, OKAY FINE,
BUT DON'T RUN OFF.

08:22.462 --> 08:24.423
WE DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE FIXED,
AND I DON'T WANT TO FIND OUT

08:24.424 --> 08:26.255
WHEN YOU'RE POPPING OUT
KITTENS IN MY CLOSET.

08:26.256 --> 08:27.837
OH, THIS IS HUMILIATING.

08:27.838 --> 08:29.680
OKAY.

08:30.841 --> 08:33.432
I PROMISE NO MATTER
WHAT YOU FALL OFF OF

08:33.433 --> 08:37.017
OR HOW WELL YOU PLAY PIANO, I
WILL NOT POST IT ON YOUTUBE.

08:39.640 --> 08:41.480
OH!

08:41.481 --> 08:42.902
NOW DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

08:42.903 --> 08:45.775
YES, I BELIEVE YOU. I'M A
WITCH FROM THE FAR SIDE.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.567
- THE OTHER REALM.
- WHATEVER.

08:47.568 --> 08:50.700
LOOK, NOW I JUST NEED TO KNOW HOW
TO TURN LENNOX BACK INTO A PERSON.

08:50.701 --> 08:54.113
YOU CAN'T. YOU WON'T HAVE YOUR FULL
POWERS UNTIL YOU DEFEAT THE DARK LORD.

08:54.114 --> 08:55.955
- WELL, HOW DO I DO THAT?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:55.956 --> 08:58.457
- WELL, WHERE IS HE?
- I DON'T KNOW.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.750
YOU'RE REALLY NOT BRINGING A WHOLE
LOT TO THE PARTY HERE, LADY.

09:00.751 --> 09:03.122
THE DARK LORD HAS
OVERTAKEN THE WITCH REALM

09:03.123 --> 09:05.625
AND IS NOW POISED TO CONQUER
THE MORTAL WORLD AS WELL.

09:05.626 --> 09:07.717
HE WISHES TO DESTROY YOU

09:07.718 --> 09:10.970
BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONLY
OBSTACLE TO HIS SUPREMACY.

09:10.971 --> 09:13.382
I FEEL HIS PRESENCE IS NEAR.

09:13.383 --> 09:15.134
WAIT, WHAT? THE DARK
LORD IS COMING HERE?

09:15.135 --> 09:16.345
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE?

09:16.346 --> 09:18.808
HE TAKES MANY FORMS AND GUISES.

09:18.809 --> 09:21.180
SO HE'S LIKE THE MERYL
STREEP OF EVIL?

09:21.181 --> 09:23.142
HE ONCE WAS MERYL STREEP.

09:23.143 --> 09:25.945
YOU KNOW, I BET IT
WAS IN "MAMMA MIA."

09:25.946 --> 09:28.948
Joey: HELLO! I'M BACK!

09:28.949 --> 09:32.531
IN A MINUTE! LOOK, DR. RADLER...

09:32.532 --> 09:35.075
I WISH SHE'D STOP DOING THAT.

09:36.576 --> 09:37.907
OH, JOE, I'M SO
GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

09:37.908 --> 09:39.458
HEY, YOU WANT TO HEAR
SOMETHING WEIRD?

09:39.459 --> 09:41.460
DO YOU KNOW WHEN I GOT HOME,
THERE WAS SOME STRAY BLACK CAT

09:41.461 --> 09:43.002
TAKING A PEE ON THE FRONT LAWN?

09:43.003 --> 09:45.875
I CHASED IT OFF, BUT IT WAS REALLY WEIRD...
BEFORE IT LEFT,

09:45.876 --> 09:48.417
IT LOOKED AT ME JUST LIKE THIS.

09:48.418 --> 09:50.509
I SWEAR I'VE SEEN THAT
LOOK SOMEWHERE BEFORE,

09:50.510 --> 09:52.591
- I JUST CAN'T PLACE IT.
- THAT WAS LENNOX.

09:52.592 --> 09:56.345
I'M A WITCH AND I TURNED
LENNOX INTO A CAT BY ACCIDENT.

09:56.346 --> 09:58.888
OOOH! SPOOKY.

09:58.889 --> 10:01.020
SOMEONE'S IN THE HALLOWEEN SPIRIT.
I LIKE THAT.

10:01.021 --> 10:03.893
I DON'T BLAME YOU FOR NOT BELIEVING ME.
I BARELY BELIEVE IT MYSELF.

10:03.894 --> 10:06.525
LISTEN, HONEY, I'D LOVE TO CHAT WITH YOU,
BUT I GOT TO GET SCARY LARRY UP AND WORKING

10:06.526 --> 10:08.357
BECAUSE THE KIDS ARE ALREADY
OUTSIDE TRICK-OR-TREATING, OKAY?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.901
- Lennox: AUNT MEL, LET ME IN!
- KEEP YOUR FUR ON, LENNOX!

10:11.902 --> 10:14.074
( girl screaming )

10:18.498 --> 10:20.660
RUN, KIDS! SAVE YOURSELF!

10:20.661 --> 10:22.202
THERE'S A CRAZED
KILLER ON THE LOOSE!

10:23.543 --> 10:26.005
( low voice ) I'M GOING
TO HACK YOU TO BITS!

10:26.006 --> 10:29.338
MWAH HA HA HA HA HA!

10:29.339 --> 10:31.210
THAT'S LAME.

10:31.211 --> 10:34.303
THAT'S NOT LAME. YOU WERE
SCARED, YOU KNOW IT.

10:34.304 --> 10:35.885
NAH.

10:35.886 --> 10:39.759
FINE, WHATEVER. HERE, TAKE
YOUR HALLOWEEN CANDY AND GO.

10:39.760 --> 10:43.102
BLACK LICORICE? GROSS!

10:43.103 --> 10:46.766
WE WALKED UP, LIKE,
SEVEN STEPS FOR THIS?

10:46.767 --> 10:49.318
HEY, IT'S CLASSIC
HALLOWEEN CANDY!

10:49.319 --> 10:53.032
- ( Theremin playing )
- ( low voice ) YEAH.

10:53.033 --> 10:56.235
- ( groaning )
- COOL.

10:56.236 --> 10:58.988
- WOW.
- ( grunts )

10:58.989 --> 11:00.830
HEY, WAIT A MINUTE. I'M
NOT EVEN DOING THAT.

11:00.831 --> 11:03.913
THAT'S WEIRD. HOW IS HE...
HOW IS HE DOING THAT?

11:03.914 --> 11:06.956
RUN, KIDS! SAVE YOURSELVES!

11:06.957 --> 11:08.838
AND MISS THIS? NO WAY!

11:08.839 --> 11:10.669
( grunts )

11:10.670 --> 11:12.792
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- I DON'T... I DON'T KNOW!

11:12.793 --> 11:14.673
IT'S SCARY LARRY. IT'S LIKE
HE'S POSSESSED OR SOMETHING.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.796
- ( grunts )
- IT'S THE DARK LORD!

11:16.797 --> 11:19.428
HE'S COME OVER TO
THIS WORLD TO GET ME!

11:19.429 --> 11:21.640
IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOU, MEL.

11:21.641 --> 11:24.263
HEY, YOU'RE A WITCH, RIGHT?
WHY DON'T YOU DO SOMETHING?

11:24.264 --> 11:27.016
- CAST A LITTLE SPELL.
- ALL RIGHT, DON'T FREAK OUT. DON'T FREAK OUT.

11:27.017 --> 11:29.769
UH, ZITHER,
ZORASTRIANS, ZOMBIES.

11:29.770 --> 11:32.571
OH, HERE'S SOMETHING...
"MAKA-LAKA-HI, LAKA HINEY HO!"

11:32.572 --> 11:34.864
- ( whirring )
- FAIL.

11:34.865 --> 11:37.947
YOU KNOW, TELL ALL YOUR FRIENDS
WE HAVE BLACK LICORICE.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.949
( grunting )

11:39.950 --> 11:42.411
HA! COME HERE, COME HERE.

11:42.412 --> 11:45.324
( grunting )

11:45.325 --> 11:47.417
HERE, JOE!

11:49.669 --> 11:52.792
- ( groaning )
- JOKE'S ON YOU, MONKEY FIGHTER.

11:52.793 --> 11:55.635
( groaning )

11:57.637 --> 12:00.179
THAT WAS AMAZING.

12:00.180 --> 12:02.893
( sighs ) I DEFEATED
THE DARK LORD.

12:05.015 --> 12:06.105
YOU?

12:06.106 --> 12:08.347
I WAS THE ONE WITH
THE LETHAL LICORICE.

12:08.348 --> 12:10.309
YEAH. YOU, ME...
SAME DIFFERENCE.

12:10.310 --> 12:12.651
THE IMPORTANT THING
IS HE'S GONE.

12:12.652 --> 12:15.945
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT. AND NOW

12:15.946 --> 12:18.237
IT'S TIME TO TAKE OUT THE TRASH.

12:18.238 --> 12:20.529
NO, WAIT A MINUTE. I CAN DO
BETTER THAN THAT. HOLD ON.

12:20.530 --> 12:23.282
OKAY, YOU READY? HERE IT IS.

12:23.283 --> 12:25.916
IT'S TRASH NIGHT

12:27.127 --> 12:28.828
AND I'M TAKING IT OUT.

12:28.829 --> 12:29.999
WAIT A MINUTE. I CAN DO BETTER.

12:30.000 --> 12:31.831
- I CAN DO BETTER...
- JUST GET RID OF IT.

12:31.832 --> 12:33.172
I HAVE TO GO FIND LENNOX.

12:33.173 --> 12:36.836
LENNOX? HERE, NIECY,
NIECY, NIECY, NIECY!

12:36.837 --> 12:38.929
( sighs )

12:40.050 --> 12:44.053
( wind blowing )

12:44.054 --> 12:45.846
( static )

12:47.848 --> 12:50.149
( low voice ) MUST KILL.

12:50.150 --> 12:53.772
MUST DESTROY WITCH.

12:53.773 --> 12:56.857
MUST AVOID PERSONAL PRONOUNS.

12:57.948 --> 13:00.901
( evil laughter )

13:03.824 --> 13:04.904
LENNOX?

13:04.905 --> 13:06.745
THIS IS YOU, RIGHT?

13:06.746 --> 13:08.577
YES, AND PUT ME DOWN.

13:08.578 --> 13:10.409
YOU'RE SQUISHING, LIKE,
FIVE OF MY BOOBS.

13:10.410 --> 13:13.913
THANK GOODNESS. OKAY, LET'S
TRY TO CHANGE YOU BACK.

13:13.914 --> 13:16.585
YUCK! YOU'RE PUTTING ME ON THE
COUNTER WHERE WE PUT FOOD?

13:16.586 --> 13:17.967
DO YOU KNOW WHERE I'VE BEEN?

13:17.968 --> 13:19.879
OH, STOP COMPLAINING. I'M
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

13:19.880 --> 13:21.590
HOW TO TURN YOU BACK
TO YOUR REGULAR SELF.

13:21.591 --> 13:23.012
( phone beeping )

13:23.013 --> 13:25.184
OKAY, RESTORE LENNOX
TO HER HUMAN FORM.

13:25.185 --> 13:27.096
Female voice: Sorry, you
have Spellbook Lite.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.268
You need to upgrade
to the full version

13:29.269 --> 13:31.190
to use that spell.

13:31.191 --> 13:34.353
HURRY UP, AUNT MEL. THE PARTY ALREADY
STARTED AND I'VE GOT TO DO MY HAIR.

13:34.354 --> 13:35.985
EXCUSE ME! I'VE JUST
BEEN BUSY, YOU KNOW,

13:35.986 --> 13:38.777
TRYING TO PROTECT ALL OF
HUMANITY FROM THE DARK LORD.

13:38.778 --> 13:40.199
WHO'S THE DARK LORD?

13:40.200 --> 13:43.032
EVIL PERSONIFIED, THE DEVIL
INCARNATE, BLAH BLAH.

13:43.033 --> 13:45.154
YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST GOING TO
DO THIS THE OLD-FASHIONED WAY

13:45.155 --> 13:46.825
AND HOPE I'M NOT VIOLATING
ANY COPYRIGHT LAWS...

13:46.826 --> 13:48.827
BIBBITY-BOBBITY-BOO!

13:48.828 --> 13:51.830
YAY! I'M BACK!

13:51.831 --> 13:53.913
YES, YOU ARE.

13:53.914 --> 13:56.916
UH, BUT YOU MIGHT WANT
TO DO A LITTLE WAXING

13:56.917 --> 13:58.918
BEFORE YOU GO OUT.

13:58.919 --> 14:01.010
( gasps )

14:01.011 --> 14:03.592
OH NO! WHAT DID YOU DO TO ME?

14:03.593 --> 14:05.384
AHH!

14:05.385 --> 14:08.928
THIS DOESN'T COME OFF. I'M LIKE
HALF-CAT, HALF-HUMAN MUTANT.

14:08.929 --> 14:11.020
THANKS A LOT, AUNT MEL.

14:11.021 --> 14:12.932
HEY, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

14:12.933 --> 14:14.773
I'M GOING TO DO
SOME STRESS EATING.

14:14.774 --> 14:17.777
OOH, BUTTER!

14:19.940 --> 14:21.780
- ( growling )
- WHAT ARE YOU UPSET ABOUT?

14:21.781 --> 14:23.983
I'M THE ONE WHO CAN'T TURN MY NIECE BACK.
LOOK AT HER.

14:23.984 --> 14:25.985
( growling )

14:25.986 --> 14:27.987
I KNOW, RIGHT?

14:27.988 --> 14:30.079
( girl screaming )

14:30.080 --> 14:31.700
OH, MORE TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

14:31.701 --> 14:33.542
- LENNOX, WILL YOU GET THE DOOR?
- HOW?

14:33.543 --> 14:35.164
I DON'T HAVE OPPOSABLE THUMBS.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.667
YOU'RE A TALKING CAT.
FIGURE IT OUT.

14:40.000 --> 14:42.211
( low voice ) MUST HAVE VICTORY.

14:42.212 --> 14:44.133
( sighs ) TELL ME ABOUT IT.

14:44.134 --> 14:47.306
WANT A GLASS OF WINE? I THINK WE DESERVE
IT AFTER KILLING THAT DARK LORD.

14:47.307 --> 14:50.770
DARK LORD STANDS BEFORE YOU.

14:52.432 --> 14:54.473
AH! YOU'RE THE DARK LORD!

14:54.474 --> 14:57.776
BEEN SEARCHING FOR TEENAGE
WITCH SEASON AFTER SEASON.

14:57.777 --> 15:00.019
MUST DESTROY.

15:00.020 --> 15:02.821
AHA!

15:02.822 --> 15:04.984
DARK LORD IS NOT A VAMPIRE.

15:04.985 --> 15:07.156
OH, DAMN!

15:07.157 --> 15:09.869
UH, HERE! GARLIC!

15:11.581 --> 15:13.203
THAT'S FOR VAMPIRES TOO.

15:14.294 --> 15:15.794
THOSE ARE SCALLIONS ANYWAY.

15:15.795 --> 15:19.089
REALLY? ARE YOU SURE?

15:20.630 --> 15:22.881
( gasps ) MY MAPLE CABINETS.

15:22.882 --> 15:25.884
THOSE ARE CUSTOM!
THAT'S IT, BITCH.

15:25.885 --> 15:27.386
GET OUT OF MY MAN!

15:27.387 --> 15:31.050
WE'RE GETTING A LOT OF COMPLAINTS
ABOUT THE BLACK LICORICE.

15:31.051 --> 15:33.602
- MUST DESTROY WITCH.
- LENNOX, IT'S THE DARK LORD.

15:33.603 --> 15:35.554
- ( growls )
- WHERE?

15:35.555 --> 15:37.356
- INSIDE JOE!
- OH NO!

15:37.357 --> 15:39.438
WELL, CAN'T YOU JUST, LIKE,
USE A SPELL OR SOMETHING?

15:39.439 --> 15:41.110
NO, MY POWERS DON'T WORK ON HIM.

15:41.111 --> 15:42.982
UM, OH! BUT THERE'S
A MAGIC YOU'VE HAD

15:42.983 --> 15:44.483
THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN
MORE POWERFUL.

15:44.484 --> 15:46.325
THE MAGIC OF LOVE.

15:46.326 --> 15:47.826
YOU'RE KIDDING ME, RIGHT?

15:47.827 --> 15:49.778
NO, LOVE IS THE STRONGEST
POWER ON EARTH.

15:49.779 --> 15:51.991
JUST... JUST REACH OUT TO HIM.
THE MAN YOU LOVE

15:51.992 --> 15:53.702
IS STILL INSIDE OF
THERE SOMEWHERE.

15:53.703 --> 15:55.494
JUST COME ON! YOU'VE
GOT TO TRY IT.

15:55.495 --> 15:57.536
OKAY, IT'S WORTH A SHOT. JOE?

15:57.537 --> 15:59.748
- ( growling )
- SWEETIE?

15:59.749 --> 16:01.340
PUDDING PIE?

16:01.341 --> 16:03.172
( growling )

16:03.173 --> 16:05.294
AH!

16:05.295 --> 16:06.795
JOE?

16:06.796 --> 16:09.178
- ( hisses )
- I KNOW YOU'RE IN THERE.

16:09.179 --> 16:11.140
FIND YOUR WAY OUT, SWEETHEART.

16:11.141 --> 16:12.851
( growling )

16:12.852 --> 16:14.434
I LOVE YOU.

16:16.556 --> 16:18.727
YOU'RE DOING IT. COME ON,
YOU CAN BEAT HIM, JOE.

16:18.728 --> 16:20.690
( growls )

16:21.901 --> 16:24.604
I LOVE YOU.

16:26.316 --> 16:27.866
( gasps )

16:27.867 --> 16:29.948
( grunting )

16:29.949 --> 16:31.820
OH, HERE, LET ME HELP YOU.

16:31.821 --> 16:33.283
GET OUT OF HIM, YOU BEAST!

16:35.035 --> 16:37.166
ACTUALLY, THAT WAS ALL ME.

16:37.167 --> 16:38.827
OH, SORRY.

16:38.828 --> 16:40.879
MAN, THIS GUY IS STRONG.

16:40.880 --> 16:42.831
I'M TELLING YOU, THIS GUY
WORKS OUT AS MUCH AS I DO.

16:42.832 --> 16:44.923
- ( beast growling )
- THE ONLY WAY FOR ME TO DESTROY HIM

16:44.924 --> 16:46.585
IS TO DESTROY MYSELF, MEL.

16:46.586 --> 16:48.127
NO! JOE, DON'T DO IT.

16:48.128 --> 16:49.338
I HAVE TO!

16:49.339 --> 16:50.969
IT'S THE ONLY WAY
THAT I CAN SAVE YOU.

16:50.970 --> 16:52.971
- ( beast growling )
- AH!

16:52.972 --> 16:54.683
IT'S THE ONLY WAY!

16:54.684 --> 16:57.226
I LOVE YOU, MEL.

16:57.227 --> 16:58.977
( beast growling )

16:58.978 --> 17:01.190
- GOODBYE.
- ( beast growling )

17:01.191 --> 17:04.313
( static )

17:04.314 --> 17:05.944
JOE!

17:05.945 --> 17:07.906
NO, THIS CAN'T BE!

17:07.907 --> 17:09.698
THAT WAS AMAZING.

17:09.699 --> 17:12.491
HE SACRIFICED HIMSELF TO SAVE
US ALL FROM THE DARK LORD.

17:12.492 --> 17:15.824
OH, MY SWEET, NOBLE JOE!

17:15.825 --> 17:19.869
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU'RE GONE FOREVER.

17:23.042 --> 17:24.963
BACK FROM DEAD!

17:24.964 --> 17:25.795
OH!

17:25.796 --> 17:27.466
I'M KIDDING. THAT'S JUST ME.

17:27.467 --> 17:29.878
OH! JOE.

17:29.879 --> 17:31.430
THAT WAS AMAZING.

17:31.431 --> 17:34.012
WOW, YOU'RE THE ONE WITH
THE SPECIAL POWERS.

17:34.013 --> 17:36.175
YEAH, I TELL YOU, IT'S A
GOOD THING I WAS HERE.

17:36.176 --> 17:38.887
OTHERWISE I NEVER WOULD HAVE
BEEN ABLE TO DEFEAT MYSELF.

17:38.888 --> 17:40.939
I COULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
WITHOUT YOU, THOUGH, BABY.

17:40.940 --> 17:43.852
OH, WELL, NOW THAT WE... JOE...

17:43.853 --> 17:46.685
DEFEATED THE DARK LORD, I
CAN FOCUS ALL MY ATTENTION

17:46.686 --> 17:48.687
ON RESTORING YOU TO
YOUR HUMAN FORM.

17:48.688 --> 17:51.450
UM, ACTUALLY, CAN I
KEEP THIS LOOK FOR NOW?

17:51.451 --> 17:53.902
I'LL HAVE A GREAT SHOT AT WINNING
THE COSTUME CONTEST AT THE PARTY.

17:53.903 --> 17:57.196
YOU CAN JUST CHANGE ME BACK
WHEN I GET HOME, OKAY? BYE.

17:57.197 --> 17:59.328
HEY, BE SAFE! HAVE FUN.

17:59.329 --> 18:01.580
YEAH, AND DON'T GO
CROSSING ANYONE'S PATH.

18:01.581 --> 18:03.662
- WELL DONE.
- ( both gasp )

18:03.663 --> 18:06.465
LOOK, SOMEDAY YOU'RE GOING TO DO THAT
TO SOMEONE IN A CONCEALED-CARRY STATE,

18:06.466 --> 18:08.257
AND YOU'RE GOING TO REGRET IT.

18:08.258 --> 18:11.340
CONGRATULATIONS, MEL. YOU
DEFEATED THE DARK LORD

18:11.341 --> 18:13.802
AND SAVED THE OTHER REALM
AS WELL AS THIS ONE.

18:13.803 --> 18:15.804
YOUR POWERS ARE NOW
FULLY RESTORED.

18:15.805 --> 18:18.016
YOU ARE ONCE AGAIN THE
GREAT WITCH THAT YOU WERE.

18:18.017 --> 18:19.718
- REALLY?
- TRY IT.

18:19.719 --> 18:21.770
( wheezing sound )

18:21.771 --> 18:23.562
THAT MOVE IS TAKEN.

18:23.563 --> 18:27.896
OH, OKAY. UH, TURN JOE INTO
THE MOST DESIRABLE MAN ALIVE.

18:27.897 --> 18:29.107
( tinkling )

18:29.108 --> 18:31.150
OH, THAT'S ODD. IT DIDN'T WORK.

18:31.151 --> 18:33.942
YES, IT DID. HE'S ALREADY THE
MOST DESIRABLE MAN I KNOW,

18:33.943 --> 18:36.285
BUT NOW WITH RAVIOLI.

18:36.286 --> 18:37.907
YEAH.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.911
AND TAKE A PEEK IN THERE.

18:42.912 --> 18:46.295
OH, NO MAGIC IS NEEDED FOR THAT AREA...
THAT'S PERFECT.

18:46.296 --> 18:48.297
NO NO NO, LOOK IN
YOUR PANTS POCKET.

18:48.298 --> 18:51.009
YOU HAVE TWO TICKETS TO JUSTIN
TIMBERLAKE AT THE TOLEDO HOLLYWOOD BOWL.

18:51.010 --> 18:52.842
WHAT?

18:53.923 --> 18:56.925
NOW I HAVE IT ALL.

18:56.926 --> 18:59.057
AND NOW, MEL, YOU
MAY TAKE YOUR PLACE

18:59.058 --> 19:00.929
AS A LEADER IN THE
REALM OF WITCHES.

19:00.930 --> 19:04.683
OH, JOE! WE'RE GOING TO
BE, LIKE, WITCH ROYALTY.

19:04.684 --> 19:07.356
OOH, MAYBE WE CAN PARTY WITH
HARRY POTTER AND HERMIONE.

19:07.357 --> 19:12.030
I'M SORRY. THE OTHER REALM HAS A
STRICT ANTI-IMMIGRATION POLICY

19:12.031 --> 19:15.864
WHEN IT COMES TO... MORTALS.

19:15.865 --> 19:17.826
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
SHE JUST SAID THAT.

19:17.827 --> 19:20.078
IT'S YOUR CHOICE, MEL.

19:20.079 --> 19:22.911
IF YOU STAY HERE, YOU
WILL LOSE YOUR POWERS

19:22.912 --> 19:25.334
AND REMAIN A MORTAL FOREVER.

19:25.335 --> 19:27.836
SO NO MORE WITCHY-WITCHY STUFF?

19:27.837 --> 19:30.879
YOU KNOW, LIKE...

19:30.880 --> 19:34.253
NO, THAT ALL GOES AWAY.

19:34.254 --> 19:36.595
( record screeches )

19:36.596 --> 19:38.297
SO WHAT DO YOU CHOOSE?

19:38.298 --> 19:41.009
WELL, I MEAN, ARE YOU KIDDING?

19:41.010 --> 19:44.434
THIS IS A NO-BRAINER.

19:46.766 --> 19:50.068
YOU'RE WILLING TO GIVE UP
ALL YOUR WITCH POWERS?

19:50.069 --> 19:51.610
YES.

19:51.611 --> 19:53.612
- ARE YOU SURE?
- YEAH.

19:53.613 --> 19:55.404
WHAT'S THE USE OF ALL
THOSE OTHER POWERS

19:55.405 --> 19:57.407
IF I DON'T HAVE THE
POWER OF LOVE?

19:59.409 --> 20:01.029
WELL, ALL RIGHT, YOU MAY STAY.

20:01.030 --> 20:03.031
BUT YOUR MAGIC WILL BE GONE

20:03.032 --> 20:05.994
AND ALL MEMORY OF THESE EVENTS
WILL BE ERASED FROM YOU BOTH.

20:05.995 --> 20:07.457
I'LL MISS YOU.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.000
SHAZAM!

20:12.001 --> 20:13.252
WHOA.

20:13.253 --> 20:14.713
- HO!
- WHAT?

20:14.714 --> 20:15.754
I FEEL WEIRD.

20:15.755 --> 20:17.796
OOH, I FEEL WEIRD TOO.
WHAT TIME IS IT?

20:17.797 --> 20:20.138
IT'S 8:30. IT'S...
IT'S ALREADY 8:30.

20:20.139 --> 20:21.800
- WHAT HAPPENED TO THE NIGHT?
- ( girl screaming )

20:21.801 --> 20:23.512
( gasps ) OH, TRICK-OR-TREATERS.

20:23.513 --> 20:25.764
GOOD, BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
TONIGHT'S BEEN SO BORING.

20:25.765 --> 20:27.606
- YEAH.
- HEY, YOU KNOW,

20:27.607 --> 20:29.978
I REALLY LOVE WHAT YOU'VE DONE
WITH THE DECORATIONS IN HERE.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.400
I MEAN, I LOVE
THIS FAKE CLEAVER.

20:31.401 --> 20:34.353
I DIDN'T DO THAT. I THOUGHT
THAT YOU DID THAT.

20:34.354 --> 20:35.944
I DIDN'T DO THAT.

20:35.945 --> 20:40.068
( creepy music playing )

20:40.069 --> 20:41.741
WHOA!

20:44.364 --> 20:45.574
AUNT MEL?

20:45.575 --> 20:47.786
I NEED YOU TO CHANGE
ME BACK RIGHT NOW!

20:47.787 --> 20:51.169
SECOND PLACE MY FURRY ASS!

20:51.170 --> 20:52.832
AUNT MEL?

20:57.086 --> 21:00.799
"WENT TO LOOK AT NEIGHBORHOOD
HALLOWEEN DECORATIONS."

21:00.800 --> 21:03.141
OKAY, FINE.

21:03.142 --> 21:05.555
I'LL WAIT.

21:19.238 --> 21:22.901
FIRST PLACE... IN
YOUR FURRY FACE!

21:22.902 --> 21:24.903
SHUT UP, RYDER!

21:24.904 --> 21:27.166
OOH!
