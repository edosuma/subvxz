00:39.472 --> 00:43.431
I've heard it said
that this here...

00:43.576 --> 00:45.305
...this here's a man's world.

00:46.780 --> 00:49.578
And some girls, they believe it.

00:50.950 --> 00:54.408
Primping and fussing
and holding out,

00:54.554 --> 00:57.387
hoping a boy will look her way.

00:59.292 --> 01:02.193
They don't know they got the power.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.628
As for me...

01:12.672 --> 01:14.799
...I'm not that kind of girl.

01:14.941 --> 01:16.966
I'm on top.

01:17.110 --> 01:18.771
Which begs the question...

01:20.447 --> 01:23.939
...if the girl's on top, well...

01:26.152 --> 01:28.586
...who's the one getting screwed?

01:33.259 --> 01:34.886
Hey, wait up!

01:35.495 --> 01:39.261
So if it's a man's world,
God wouldn't have made me.

01:39.999 --> 01:42.365
Or that fat fuck.

01:54.781 --> 01:58.774
OK, who can give me
an example of a good choice?

01:59.619 --> 02:01.382
- Tonya?
- Waiting.

02:01.521 --> 02:04.217
I mean, if a guy
really likes you, he'll wait.

02:04.891 --> 02:09.351
And if he doesn't understand,
well, you know... so what?

02:09.496 --> 02:13.933
Most excellent.
But hey, I know how it is.

02:14.067 --> 02:17.002
I was young, too.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.504
- Our hormones can get the best of us.
- Hey, pass it down.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.734
The only safe sex is no sex.

02:23.877 --> 02:27.210
Unless you stay busy,
get some hobbies,

02:27.347 --> 02:31.443
and practice abstinence,
you could end up asking,

02:31.584 --> 02:35.042
"Was the momentary thrill
really worth it?"

02:35.188 --> 02:37.588
What are some healthy alternatives?

02:37.724 --> 02:40.625
- Tonya?
- You could have a pizza party.

02:40.760 --> 02:44.093
Right on.
Who doesn't love pizza?

02:44.230 --> 02:46.289
Anyone else?

02:48.568 --> 02:51.002
What are your thoughts
on the pull-out method?

02:56.242 --> 02:58.369
You must like the time
we spend together.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.773
It's a real hoot.

02:59.913 --> 03:02.279
Your classmates are
impressionable, Miss Edmonston.

03:02.415 --> 03:04.940
Your ears might be
used to that kind of talk,

03:05.084 --> 03:07.177
but most of these kids
come from good families.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.222
You have any positive
males in your life?

03:10.924 --> 03:13.017
A pastor or a neighbor or an uncle...

03:13.159 --> 03:14.888
It's none of your business.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.087
You're an exasperating girl,
Miss Edmonston.

03:17.230 --> 03:19.892
According to Mr. Potter,
you spoke quite explicitly

03:20.033 --> 03:21.728
about male projectile.

03:21.868 --> 03:25.065
- It's a sex education class.
- Lifestyle choices.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.939
I'm putting you in Challengers.

03:31.077 --> 03:33.637
- Special Ed?
- Challengers.

03:33.780 --> 03:37.011
- That's for retards.
- It's either that or expulsion.

03:37.150 --> 03:39.243
Miss Pierce will give you
your new schedule.

03:39.385 --> 03:42.081
What is there to know? It's one room
in the basement, all the time.

03:42.222 --> 03:46.056
Danielle, you're a smart girl.
You just make bad choices.

03:46.192 --> 03:49.184
If you'll do your homework,
and stop being a distraction to others,

03:49.329 --> 03:51.957
you'll be back with
the normal kids in no time.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.565
Danielle...

03:54.801 --> 03:57.565
...nobody likes a dirty girl.

03:59.138 --> 04:00.833
Hello, Challengers!

04:00.974 --> 04:02.066
Hey.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.642
Today we are going to start a project

04:04.777 --> 04:09.043
that will hopefully teach us
that parenthood is no joke.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.174
Right, Sabrina? Yeah.

04:12.318 --> 04:14.548
Nobody's laughing at her house.

04:14.687 --> 04:18.053
OK, everyone partner up
with someone of the opposite sex.

04:20.660 --> 04:22.651
Two by two, like in the ark.

04:22.795 --> 04:25.525
Who does not have a partner?

04:25.665 --> 04:29.499
OK, Benita, why don't you
come over here near Joaquin?

04:29.636 --> 04:34.005
And Clarke? We'll think of something.

04:40.213 --> 04:41.805
OK, class?

04:41.948 --> 04:45.076
This is Danielle Edmon... Edmonston.

04:45.218 --> 04:49.917
And she will be joining us today,
so everyone say a big hello.

04:50.056 --> 04:51.921
Hey.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.185
OK, Danielle. We're partnering up,

04:54.327 --> 04:57.023
so why don't you just head right
on back there with Clarke.

05:05.271 --> 05:09.571
For the next six weeks,
you will be married to your partner

05:09.709 --> 05:12.007
in every sense but the biblical one.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.340
You're that fag, right?

05:14.480 --> 05:19.315
And these precious sacks
of flour will be your bundles of joy.

05:19.452 --> 05:21.249
These are your daily journals.

05:21.387 --> 05:24.049
You will record baby's first steps,

05:24.190 --> 05:29.685
things that baby does that
are so cute you can't stand it.

05:29.829 --> 05:34.129
OK, here is Mrs. Stork, making
a special delivery to you.

05:34.534 --> 05:36.798
Who needs a baby?

05:36.936 --> 05:41.498
- Takes after you.
- This is going to be so much fun.

05:45.311 --> 05:49.042
- What do you want?
- Uh, we're partners.

05:49.182 --> 05:52.982
No offense, but my designated is, as
of this morning, no longer designated.

05:53.119 --> 05:55.212
I don't know what that means.

05:55.355 --> 05:58.483
It's Danielle's three D's of dating:
Discriminate, designate, and dump,

05:58.624 --> 06:00.251
and since the unfortunate
dumping of Brad,

06:00.393 --> 06:03.260
due to his lack of sanitary
respect, I'm on to the next.

06:03.396 --> 06:07.890
And quite frankly, as a dick smoker,
you don't qualify.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.468
But we're married.

06:14.374 --> 06:15.705
Discriminate.

06:16.909 --> 06:19.104
Miss Hatcher says
we need to be good parents.

06:22.915 --> 06:23.779
Designate.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.758
Hey.

06:40.767 --> 06:42.291
You got a light?

06:42.435 --> 06:43.663
Hey, fellas.

06:47.006 --> 06:51.443
- You're that girl, ain't you?
- Yep, I'm that girl.

06:52.578 --> 06:54.512
You know what I heard about you?

06:55.748 --> 06:58.774
Don't believe everything you hear.
Unless it's really good.

07:00.486 --> 07:01.783
Then it's true.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.254
Well, I hear you're
with the retards now.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.361
Your principal called today.

07:49.502 --> 07:51.868
I am very disappointed in you.

07:55.908 --> 07:57.842
Now, just say
whatever comes to mind.

08:04.650 --> 08:08.108
- Some pretty racy stuff, huh?
- Hm.

08:08.254 --> 08:09.744
Want to know what I think?

08:09.889 --> 08:12.551
I think those pictures scare you.

08:13.693 --> 08:17.789
You know, Clarke, sexual feelings
aren't something to be afraid of.

08:20.199 --> 08:22.463
What's your favorite kind of breast?

08:23.769 --> 08:25.100
Long ones?

08:26.772 --> 08:27.761
Pointy ones?

08:29.442 --> 08:30.932
How do you like 'em, Clarke?

08:33.779 --> 08:34.803
Hairy.

08:36.782 --> 08:38.340
Hairy.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.836
Clarke!

09:00.973 --> 09:03.498
Stop it! Let's go.

09:09.815 --> 09:13.251
Roger me this, Son.
You and I had a deal, didn't we?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.752
Seems to me you're not holding up
your end of the bargain, though,

09:15.888 --> 09:17.446
you copy me?

09:18.491 --> 09:21.187
Clarke? Do you copy me?

09:23.496 --> 09:27.296
You know what that makes you?
It makes you a welcher.

09:27.433 --> 09:30.425
The only thing worse than
being a gay is being a welcher.

09:31.504 --> 09:34.735
- I'm not no gay.
- Yeah, who am I supposed to believe?

09:35.541 --> 09:38.510
A 15-year-old welcher,
or a qualified medical physician?

09:38.644 --> 09:41.010
- He's a chiropractor.
- He's got experience.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.647
What the hell did you do in there?

09:43.783 --> 09:45.478
You think this is funny,
you little shit?

09:45.618 --> 09:48.815
- Wheel!
- God, don't do that!

09:48.955 --> 09:51.947
Don't yell at somebody
that's lost control of the car.

09:52.725 --> 09:55.751
You're a hair's breath from getting
your ass sent away for good.

09:56.362 --> 09:57.886
That military academy
is starting to look like

09:58.030 --> 10:00.464
a real sweet option to me
and your mother about now.

10:02.335 --> 10:07.739
In her spare time, Maggie enjoys
long walks by the creek,

10:07.873 --> 10:13.311
and stopping for sodas
at Sonic and shopping.

10:15.781 --> 10:19.148
Great work,
guys, really terrific.

10:19.285 --> 10:21.253
OK, Clarke and Danielle, you're up.

10:27.793 --> 10:31.490
Who do you think you are?
I mean, really.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.758
You didn't even give her an outfit.

10:34.500 --> 10:37.060
And for everyone else,
I appreciate your effort,

10:37.203 --> 10:42.607
and your time that you put
into realizing your children.

10:42.742 --> 10:45.677
Because, that one
would be dead on the street

10:45.811 --> 10:49.212
or laying under a car somewhere,
with a needle in her arm.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.982
Hey, Mike!

10:58.591 --> 10:59.683
Mike, get in the car.

11:00.793 --> 11:01.782
Let's go!

11:11.137 --> 11:12.263
Get in.

11:13.539 --> 11:15.336
- Me?
- We got homework.

11:22.848 --> 11:25.112
Don't worry
about being nice to my mom.

11:25.251 --> 11:27.242
She's a total poon.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.581
Danielle? Is that you?

11:30.623 --> 11:32.090
This is Clarke. He's from school.

11:32.224 --> 11:36.558
Sue-Ann. I'm Danielle's mom,
but you wouldn't know it to look at me.

11:36.696 --> 11:38.596
That's a totally gross thing to say.

11:38.731 --> 11:42.929
But people think we're
sisters all the time. Cookie?

11:43.069 --> 11:45.594
Nobody wants one of your
sad instant cookies, Sue-Ann.

11:45.738 --> 11:50.038
- You said you liked these.
- I said I liked the dough.

11:54.980 --> 11:56.208
Thanks.

12:02.788 --> 12:04.050
She's nice.

12:04.190 --> 12:05.919
She was a total slut
when she was in high school.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.993
Now she's with this Mormon guy,
and she thinks she's Suzy Homemaker.

12:09.128 --> 12:11.756
Danielle, we talked about this.

12:11.897 --> 12:15.094
You can have boys over,
but this door stays open.

12:15.234 --> 12:18.397
We're doing homework.
Besides, Clarke here's a fag.

12:22.374 --> 12:24.672
Ray's bringing the kids
over for dinner later.

12:24.810 --> 12:26.607
Y'all think you're
gonna be done by then?

12:26.746 --> 12:30.147
If you close the goddamn door and
leave us alone and let us concentrate.

12:36.989 --> 12:40.686
If I talked to my mom that way,
my dad would kick the shit out of me.

12:43.429 --> 12:44.953
I don't have a dad.

12:45.564 --> 12:48.089
So I do what I want.

12:49.502 --> 12:51.026
Boy or girl?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.195
I think I'd ruin a boy.

12:53.339 --> 12:55.432
Girl. Name?

12:57.610 --> 13:00.238
Uh... I don't know.

13:00.379 --> 13:03.143
How about Joan? Like Joan Jett.

13:03.282 --> 13:06.012
Or Crawford. That's nice.

13:06.886 --> 13:08.581
Is there some sort of special gene

13:08.721 --> 13:10.814
that makes you say "Crawford"
when I say "Joan"?

13:11.323 --> 13:12.312
Huh?

13:12.458 --> 13:14.585
It just seems the more times
a person gets poked in the butt,

13:14.727 --> 13:16.695
the more likely they
are to say stupid faggy shit.

13:22.868 --> 13:24.028
I'm a virgin.

13:28.874 --> 13:30.671
It's not a big deal.

13:32.211 --> 13:33.872
Tell it to my dad.

13:35.147 --> 13:37.342
He'd be happier if I didn't exist.

13:38.851 --> 13:40.216
That's not true.

13:42.121 --> 13:44.589
I'm sure my dad loves me,
and I don't even know him.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.286
That don't make no sense.

13:48.594 --> 13:50.619
You know, if you're not careful,
you're gonna end up one of them

13:50.763 --> 13:54.096
overweight homos with nobody
to love you but a gerbil named Bruce.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.127
You ready for me, baby?

13:57.269 --> 13:58.668
Here I come.

14:06.178 --> 14:08.078
Daddy's cleaning you all up.

14:12.885 --> 14:14.216
Yes!

14:18.224 --> 14:20.715
- Is that your dad?
- Unfortunately.

14:22.761 --> 14:25.889
- Where the hell have you been?
- I had homework.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.622
Hey!

14:31.470 --> 14:33.062
You forgot this.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.107
You ruin me for anybody else.

14:50.155 --> 14:52.020
Hey.

14:55.294 --> 14:57.023
Hey.

14:58.931 --> 15:00.330
Shit.

15:46.245 --> 15:47.974
Peggy, what are you doing?

16:00.592 --> 16:02.321
Are you crazy? That dog would kill you.

16:03.696 --> 16:05.755
- Oh, hi!
- There she is!

16:05.898 --> 16:08.230
We saved you some. It's on the stove.

16:09.935 --> 16:13.268
Your mother and I would like
to speak with you about something.

16:14.206 --> 16:15.503
Where's Mindy?

16:17.176 --> 16:18.905
Get out of my room!

16:19.044 --> 16:21.569
- You can be Heather.
- This is bullshit.

16:21.714 --> 16:23.841
I mean, you can marry
this Mormon loser if you like,

16:23.983 --> 16:27.749
but there is no way I'm sharing
my room with this little twat!

16:27.886 --> 16:30.047
All right now, that's
going to be rule number one.

16:30.189 --> 16:32.350
Anyone caught swearing
under this roof

16:32.491 --> 16:34.118
is going to get their
mouth washed out with soap.

16:34.259 --> 16:36.784
- Fuck you!
- Danielle.

16:36.929 --> 16:39.056
- Don't test me.
- What's a twat?

16:39.198 --> 16:41.792
You see? Now that's
what I'm talking about.

16:41.934 --> 16:44.266
Evil has a unique way of spiraling.

16:44.403 --> 16:47.895
A twat is an ugly,
flatulent, hairless vagina!

16:48.040 --> 16:51.942
- I'm not going to warn you again.
- OK now, Ray, Danielle.

16:53.345 --> 16:56.246
Have you ever heard of
the celestial kingdom, Danielle?

16:57.583 --> 17:02.316
That's a magical place in the sky
where we'll live for all eternity.

17:02.454 --> 17:05.582
- That's very good, honey.
- So?

17:06.692 --> 17:09.217
Well, we want you
there with us, Danielle.

17:09.361 --> 17:10.692
What are you talking about?

17:10.829 --> 17:13.957
After your mother and I are
married, I'm going to adopt you.

17:14.098 --> 17:16.896
- The hell you are!
- The hell I'm not.

17:17.036 --> 17:19.266
It's the only way for you to get in.

17:19.405 --> 17:21.464
We don't want you cast into...

17:21.607 --> 17:22.665
...the outer darkness.

17:22.808 --> 17:25.106
How's that different from any other day?

17:25.243 --> 17:28.645
Think about it, Danielle.
You've always wanted a daddy.

17:28.781 --> 17:31.579
- I have a daddy.
- A real daddy.

17:32.351 --> 17:35.343
You know what? I'm going to take
this family on a retreat this weekend.

17:35.487 --> 17:39.287
- Oh, wow! That's great!
- A little fishing, a little hot cocoa.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.484
- Help you get used to the idea.
- You love cocoa.

17:41.627 --> 17:44.926
I'm not going anywhere. Me and Clarke
are going to work on our project.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.395
Well, family first.

17:46.532 --> 17:48.966
Tough love time, Danielle.
You don't want us,

17:49.101 --> 17:50.432
- we don't want you either.
- Ray!

17:50.569 --> 17:52.469
- You can stay.
- Thank you.

17:52.604 --> 17:55.004
But we're taking all
the food out of the kitchen.

17:55.140 --> 17:57.131
- All the money out of your pockets.
- Fine.

17:57.276 --> 17:59.210
- And the keys to your car.
- What?

17:59.344 --> 18:00.675
- No! No!
- Then you will know

18:00.813 --> 18:03.873
what it means to be alone
and stranded for all eternity!

18:04.016 --> 18:07.713
- Ray, not a good idea.
- Well now, dadgum it, Sue-Ann.

18:07.853 --> 18:09.184
You want me to be
the man of the house,

18:09.321 --> 18:10.913
you gotta let me
make the tough decisions.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.081
I believe, after this weekend,

18:13.225 --> 18:15.989
Danielle will see the wisdom
and let me be her daddy.

18:16.128 --> 18:20.531
Yeah? Does that mean
this guy will be my brother?

18:20.666 --> 18:23.328
Well, is that a problem?

18:23.469 --> 18:25.369
Yeah, considering I fucked him.

18:27.306 --> 18:30.173
- Mindy, go to your room.
- Don't you...!

18:31.210 --> 18:34.236
- Hey, you fucking cow!
- Girl fight!

18:34.379 --> 18:36.006
I hate you!

18:36.148 --> 18:37.638
No!

18:37.783 --> 18:41.150
Calm down!
I am bigger, and I will win.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.151
Let go of me!

18:43.822 --> 18:45.915
You are not my dad!

19:04.576 --> 19:07.704
Could you leave me alone? Please?

19:09.348 --> 19:11.009
Ray's a good man.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.581
He could be a good father.

19:17.222 --> 19:21.090
You can try to make me a Mormon,
but you're still a shitty mother.

19:25.197 --> 19:27.995
Good guys don't come
around that often, Danielle.

19:30.536 --> 19:32.401
I'd like to keep this one.

19:35.140 --> 19:36.801
He's not even cute.

19:55.260 --> 19:57.922
We could have
a good family going here.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.958
I don't want your stupid fake family.

20:05.571 --> 20:06.765
OK.

20:14.646 --> 20:16.671
We'll see how you do on your own.

20:36.268 --> 20:37.565
Meet Joan.

20:37.703 --> 20:41.264
So named for the irrepressible
lead singer of the Blackhearts.

20:41.406 --> 20:43.931
And the alcoholic,
child-abusing movie star.

20:45.510 --> 20:46.943
Hey, wait up.

20:47.079 --> 20:49.513
Don't fuck with me. I haven't
eaten in, like, 13 hours.

20:49.648 --> 20:50.808
Why not?

20:50.949 --> 20:53.440
Sue-Ann thinks she can
starve me into being a Mormon.

20:53.585 --> 20:56.554
- That sucks.
- I'm having a really shitty day.

20:56.688 --> 20:59.020
If you don't mind,
I'd just like to be left alone.

20:59.157 --> 21:01.057
My dad said that I can
take you out tonight, his treat.

21:01.193 --> 21:04.526
I have discriminated,
and designated. And I designate you.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.297
Just... Please, just go away.

21:08.433 --> 21:12.164
He gave me his credit card
if you want to go eat, or something.

21:19.878 --> 21:22.142
Screw this.
I need a fork, you want one?

21:25.717 --> 21:28.515
Chinese men must be good
with their fingers, I swear.

21:28.654 --> 21:30.918
I hear they have straight pubic hair.

21:31.056 --> 21:35.117
I tired to get a look at Shani Suzuki's
once in the locker room.

21:35.260 --> 21:38.195
She's real careful with
her towel, so I never saw shit.

21:43.802 --> 21:46.566
- Why are the lights off?
- Uh, fluorescent bulbs hurt my eyes.

21:46.705 --> 21:49.071
Sue-Ann's so cheap.
You'd think at her age

21:49.207 --> 21:51.004
she'd want to give her face
the benefit of the doubt.

21:51.143 --> 21:53.703
But it saves money, so I guess
she doesn't mind being green.

21:56.715 --> 21:58.342
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

21:58.483 --> 22:01.008
You're hitting on me,
and I do not appreciate it.

22:01.153 --> 22:04.611
I have discriminated,
and I have designated.

22:04.756 --> 22:05.745
Ahh!

22:07.059 --> 22:08.720
What the fuck?
I thought you were a faggot.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.953
- Only 65 percent.
- Huh?

22:11.096 --> 22:14.691
My therapist showed me this chart.
It says that I'm 35 percent hetero.

22:14.833 --> 22:16.494
And if I can get that up to 60 percent,

22:16.635 --> 22:18.466
my parents won't
send me to military school.

22:19.371 --> 22:21.430
You're bleeding.
I'm gonna get you a Kleenex.

22:24.476 --> 22:25.773
Thanks.

22:25.911 --> 22:28.175
Soon as it stops bleeding,
you'd best go.

22:28.313 --> 22:31.009
You send me back now and
they're going to know we didn't do it.

22:31.149 --> 22:34.744
Contrary to popular belief,
I'm not the world's personal whore bag.

22:35.721 --> 22:38.087
I just figured, after yesterday,
you wouldn't mind.

22:39.024 --> 22:40.286
You'd best go now.

22:42.627 --> 22:44.424
Joan's family tree's due tomorrow.

22:45.964 --> 22:47.397
Shouldn't we work on it?

22:49.434 --> 22:50.492
Hm?

22:54.373 --> 22:55.738
Sometimes...

22:57.876 --> 22:59.639
...he hurts me.

23:07.452 --> 23:09.420
Well...

23:09.554 --> 23:11.351
...he already thought we were doing it.

23:11.490 --> 23:13.458
What, am I going to save
my reputation now?

23:14.793 --> 23:18.627
- You owe me one.
- Thank you.

23:18.764 --> 23:21.358
- Thank you.
- Ah, ah! Mm-mm.

23:40.252 --> 23:41.981
Oh, shit.

23:43.922 --> 23:45.321
It's lopsided.

23:45.457 --> 23:48.756
Looks like we're gonna be spending
holidays with your side of the family.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.486
We should put some on your side
just to balance it.

23:50.629 --> 23:53.860
Maybe draw some birds
or something in the branches.

23:54.633 --> 23:55.895
It just doesn't look very good.

24:05.143 --> 24:06.770
I'm gonna show you something.

24:07.312 --> 24:09.712
When I do, you can't say
it's stupid or nothing.

24:09.848 --> 24:10.837
OK.

24:13.185 --> 24:16.586
- What did you do to your hair?
- It's Sue-Ann, you idiot.

24:16.721 --> 24:18.211
Oh.

24:21.726 --> 24:22.920
That your dad?

24:23.061 --> 24:26.360
I found it in Sue-Ann's jewelry box
when I was little, and I swiped it.

24:26.498 --> 24:29.296
- He's cute.
- Thanks.

24:30.435 --> 24:33.199
- Let's put him in.
- I don't know his name.

24:33.338 --> 24:35.738
I'm a real good drawer.
I could draw him in.

24:37.843 --> 24:41.506
No, just do birds or something.

24:42.514 --> 24:43.776
Poor Joan.

24:43.915 --> 24:46.475
She only has one grandpa,
and he's a total dick.

24:47.486 --> 24:49.147
What are we gonna tell her?

24:50.355 --> 24:52.823
They were high school sweethearts,

24:52.958 --> 24:55.688
and he was handsome
and magical.

24:55.827 --> 24:59.786
You know, if they were high school
sweethearts, he'd be in her yearbook.

24:59.931 --> 25:03.799
I checked those, like, a zillion times.
He didn't go to her school.

25:03.935 --> 25:05.630
Maybe he wasn't a student.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.339
You take this one, OK?

25:24.956 --> 25:26.218
Peggy?

25:27.959 --> 25:29.449
What is that?

25:32.664 --> 25:34.154
It's just as well.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.097
I wasn't thrilled by the idea
of my dad being a pedophile.

25:42.007 --> 25:44.305
This one don't have no signatures.

25:44.442 --> 25:46.501
That's the year she dropped out,
'cause of me.

25:52.517 --> 25:54.951
Ooh, football players are yummy.

25:55.086 --> 25:56.815
Ah! They're the worst.

25:56.955 --> 26:00.948
I mean, the idea and all is hot,
but that cream they use is so nasty.

26:01.092 --> 26:04.186
I like they way they smell,
like Bengay and ferns.

26:04.329 --> 26:07.628
You have no self-respect.

26:07.766 --> 26:09.825
I'm gonna get some more food.
You want some?

26:11.570 --> 26:12.730
OK.

26:18.610 --> 26:21.044
- Danielle?
- What?

26:22.347 --> 26:23.678
Found him.

26:34.626 --> 26:38.323
Assistant coach, Danny Briggs.

26:40.298 --> 26:43.995
Danny? You're named after him.

26:51.943 --> 26:54.343
- Hello?
- Hey, baby. You doing OK?

26:54.479 --> 26:55.673
Just fine.

26:55.814 --> 26:57.509
Have you had time
to think about things?

26:58.149 --> 26:59.446
Yeah.

27:01.286 --> 27:03.914
You're right.
I do need a man in my life.

27:04.689 --> 27:05.815
It's working.

27:08.226 --> 27:11.753
Listen, baby. In my bedroom under
the lamp, I left you some cash.

27:11.896 --> 27:14.126
Go ahead and order
yourself a pizza. OK?

27:14.265 --> 27:15.459
OK.

27:18.937 --> 27:21.337
And we'll be back on Monday.

27:21.473 --> 27:24.670
- OK.
- Hey, you.

27:25.844 --> 27:27.607
I love you.

27:29.581 --> 27:31.776
OK.

27:37.989 --> 27:40.514
This house is really nice.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.786
Maybe there's another
Danny Briggs in Norman.

27:43.962 --> 27:45.554
No, this is it.

27:48.700 --> 27:50.600
Maybe you should've called first.

28:00.945 --> 28:02.913
- Yeah?
- Hi.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.370
Hi.

28:05.650 --> 28:07.208
I'm Sue-Ann's little girl.

28:08.887 --> 28:10.650
Good for you.

28:11.423 --> 28:13.983
What can I do for you?

28:14.125 --> 28:16.889
We're looking for Danny Briggs.
You him?

28:17.562 --> 28:18.756
Billy?

28:21.032 --> 28:22.294
Who is it?

28:25.437 --> 28:28.167
Let's see, we moved in here,
when, about a year ago?

28:28.306 --> 28:31.070
Let's see... it was
right after my sister's wedding,

28:31.209 --> 28:33.541
which was a week before
the space shuttle blew up.

28:33.678 --> 28:36.670
- Such a sad time for the country.
- I'm still not over it.

28:37.615 --> 28:41.278
I don't mean to be rude or nothing,
but where the fuck is my dad?

28:41.953 --> 28:44.854
- You're saucy, I like that.
- Fresno, sweetie.

28:44.989 --> 28:47.753
I like your house. It's super tasteful.

28:47.892 --> 28:49.553
- Fresno?
- California.

28:49.694 --> 28:51.252
You should've seen it
when we first moved in.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.795
That wife of his

28:52.931 --> 28:54.990
had it all done up in faux country.

28:55.133 --> 28:56.862
Oh, I hate that.

28:57.001 --> 28:58.866
We almost didn't get
this house because of her.

28:59.003 --> 29:01.801
When she found out we were in a
long-term committed life partnership.

29:01.940 --> 29:03.532
Bitch.

29:03.675 --> 29:08.112
- Hey, you got an address?
- Does she even know about you?

29:08.246 --> 29:10.771
Danny's wife? Oh, my God.

29:17.021 --> 29:20.684
- They asked us to forward the mail.
- We never did. Oops.

29:20.825 --> 29:22.122
Would you like to deliver it?

29:23.561 --> 29:27.327
- Thanks.
- She is gonna shit twice and die.

29:27.465 --> 29:29.194
You are bad.

29:29.334 --> 29:31.461
- California.
- You are.

29:34.139 --> 29:35.572
Get up!

29:38.143 --> 29:41.442
- Come on, we have to go!
- Where do you want to eat breakfast?

29:41.579 --> 29:44.047
You know, I think Sambo's
takes credit cards.

29:44.182 --> 29:46.946
- You're taking me to California.
- You're a crazy person.

29:47.085 --> 29:49.212
Ray took my keys or I'd drive myself.

29:49.354 --> 29:51.345
Dani, my parents will kill me.

29:51.489 --> 29:54.083
Well, tell them you were
manipulated by my pussy.

29:54.225 --> 29:56.659
I can't steal my dad's car.

29:57.729 --> 30:01.358
I don't know what would happen,
but I imagine it would hurt. A lot.

30:02.934 --> 30:04.993
I don't want to be a Mormon, Clarke.

30:07.705 --> 30:09.832
It's my chance.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.339
I've never known my daddy.

30:11.476 --> 30:14.309
And now I've got
a name and an address.

30:15.246 --> 30:16.406
It's my hope.

30:19.217 --> 30:20.479
Please?

30:24.455 --> 30:25.717
I can't.

30:28.426 --> 30:31.589
Mom, I'm home!

30:49.047 --> 30:50.571
Did you have a good time?

30:55.086 --> 30:56.849
What are we going
to do about you, Clarke?

30:59.591 --> 31:02.583
You know you're not supposed
to drink from the container!

31:03.561 --> 31:05.495
Come here! Goddamn it!

31:06.264 --> 31:08.994
Clarke! Clarke! Come here!

31:09.133 --> 31:11.658
Don't you take my car! Hey! Hey!

31:11.803 --> 31:13.566
Hey! God damn it!

31:14.472 --> 31:16.940
Ow! Clarke!

31:24.215 --> 31:25.443
Bring Joan!

31:30.688 --> 31:31.916
Whoo!

31:32.056 --> 31:34.422
Dear Diary,

31:34.559 --> 31:37.756
I am super excited
about our family vacation.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.887
I'm only a week old and already

31:40.031 --> 31:42.864
I'm seeing all the great sights
of this great land.

31:44.602 --> 31:46.467
It is said that most
American families

31:46.604 --> 31:48.799
don't spend enough
quality time together.

31:48.940 --> 31:50.840
My family is different.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.636
Whoo!

31:52.777 --> 31:56.440
I ain't never been out of Oklahoma!
Goddamn!

31:56.581 --> 31:59.516
Whoo!

31:59.651 --> 32:02.449
My grandma lives in Dallas,
so I'm used to traveling.

32:02.587 --> 32:05.647
- Have you ever seen the ocean?
- No.

32:07.125 --> 32:08.990
I ain't never seen the ocean neither.

32:09.127 --> 32:11.891
So when we get to Fresno,
we go to the beach.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.090
Don't you just love Melissa Manchester?

32:18.369 --> 32:23.329
You know... I was thinking when we get
back, we could enter the talent show.

32:23.474 --> 32:25.066
Do one of her songs.

32:26.277 --> 32:28.074
I'm not going on no stage with you.

32:29.447 --> 32:32.075
There's no way I'm signing up
for the talent show.

32:32.216 --> 32:34.150
It just wouldn't be right in the
public eye to see the two of us

32:34.285 --> 32:36.150
belting out the theme
from Ice Castles.

32:38.056 --> 32:40.422
What if we did "Don't Cry Out Loud"?

32:40.558 --> 32:42.423
Clarke, I'm not going back.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.755
And that song sucks.

32:46.431 --> 32:48.456
If you spill that, my dad'll kill me.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.528
Baby...

32:52.170 --> 32:54.536
...you came out of the closet,

32:54.672 --> 32:57.266
stole his car and took off
with the class whore.

32:58.476 --> 33:00.967
You're the definition of dead.

33:08.319 --> 33:09.308
Hello?

33:09.454 --> 33:10.887
I have
a collect call from Clarke.

33:11.022 --> 33:12.546
Yes, yes.

33:13.558 --> 33:17.585
- Clarke, honey, where are you?
- Is Daddy real mad at me?

33:17.729 --> 33:21.460
Honestly, honey,
I'm afraid of what he might do.

33:22.100 --> 33:25.627
- Does he still want to send me away?
- Your father is...

33:25.770 --> 33:29.365
...just sort of determined when he
makes up his mind about something.

33:29.507 --> 33:31.236
I know.

33:31.376 --> 33:33.742
We can just try
to convince him together.

33:33.878 --> 33:35.505
All right, can you do that?

33:36.748 --> 33:38.716
Clarke, are you with that girl?

33:43.388 --> 33:46.846
- Peggy? Who was that?
- Nobody.

33:48.326 --> 33:50.419
Let's go over to that girl's house.

33:50.561 --> 33:52.051
Somebody should wait by the phone.

33:53.031 --> 33:54.396
All right.

34:04.242 --> 34:06.437
Did you tell
your parents where we are?

34:06.577 --> 34:07.839
I swear to God, if you did, Clarke,

34:07.979 --> 34:10.607
I will pull this car over
and kick your ass out!

34:10.748 --> 34:12.739
You are running toward something,
Danielle.

34:12.884 --> 34:15.318
- I am just running away.
- Well, ain't that poetic?

34:15.453 --> 34:18.114
My daddy's credit card is financing
this little adventure of yours.

34:18.255 --> 34:22.317
- You have not even said, "Thank you."
- Some things go without saying.

34:22.460 --> 34:25.257
Then I guess it goes without saying

34:25.396 --> 34:27.920
that you are the neatest person
that I have ever met!

34:28.065 --> 34:30.295
And I am not afraid no more
when I'm around you,

34:30.435 --> 34:33.199
'cause you are cooler
than I will ever be.

34:33.337 --> 34:37.706
And It also goes without saying
that I would never tell on you!

34:44.782 --> 34:46.841
I promise
I'll find a way to thank you.

35:15.646 --> 35:16.510
Breaker, breaker.

35:17.815 --> 35:20.147
Got me a peeper in my sights.

35:20.885 --> 35:23.251
No! No!

35:25.156 --> 35:27.420
Breaking and entering,
was that really necessary?

35:27.558 --> 35:28.923
I mean, couldn't you have just called?

35:29.060 --> 35:31.187
That would've been
the neighborly thing to do.

35:31.329 --> 35:34.992
I got an at-risk kid. And he is at risk.

35:35.133 --> 35:36.293
Hm-hm.

35:36.434 --> 35:38.595
Hey, I need some
medical attention here.

35:38.736 --> 35:40.863
I got my ass bleeding like a sieve.

35:41.005 --> 35:43.200
Oh, and you think
that's news around here?

35:55.219 --> 35:58.746
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth

35:58.890 --> 36:02.758
# They say in heaven love comes first

36:02.894 --> 36:06.694
# We'll make heaven a place on earth

36:06.831 --> 36:10.927
# Ooh, heaven is a place on earth... #

36:11.068 --> 36:13.559
We were just passing through
and thought we'd stop by and say...

36:13.704 --> 36:16.229
Hi. You live in a beautiful place.

36:16.941 --> 36:18.238
Hi...

36:19.110 --> 36:20.668
What do you think of my hair?

36:20.811 --> 36:22.005
Bonjour...

36:23.281 --> 36:25.146
Hola...

36:25.616 --> 36:30.178
It's so great to finally meet you.
I'm real excited to be... Shit.

36:32.323 --> 36:36.282
How am I supposed to face my father?
I look like a fucking leper.

36:36.427 --> 36:37.860
Where's Joan?

36:41.566 --> 36:42.999
Oops.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.898
Clarke.

36:46.037 --> 36:48.801
- You've gotta be more careful with her.
- Sorry.

36:48.940 --> 36:50.567
How would you like
to be dropped on your head?

36:50.708 --> 36:53.802
I have been dropped on my head.
Daddy says Mama dropped me,

36:53.945 --> 36:56.072
and that's what
accounts for my feminine ways.

36:56.214 --> 36:57.772
You trying to make Joan a lesbian?

36:57.915 --> 37:00.440
You gays are always trying
to convert everybody.

37:00.585 --> 37:03.452
Well, I don't see no damage.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.988
None that Hatcher
would notice, anyway.

37:06.123 --> 37:10.184
If you're not going back, why are
you so worried about your grade?

37:12.630 --> 37:14.860
Go to sleep.

37:14.999 --> 37:17.365
A long day ahead of us tomorrow.

37:19.537 --> 37:20.799
You ever tried Magic Fingers?

37:22.273 --> 37:24.298
Lay down.

37:30.081 --> 37:32.777
OK, OK, now do this.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.045
- Uh...
- Uh...

37:42.760 --> 37:44.785
Oh! Shit! Goddamn it!

37:44.929 --> 37:47.056
You can't yank like that, that fast!

37:47.198 --> 37:49.166
Well, I see you made a friend.

37:49.300 --> 37:51.928
Joseph?
What happened to your behind?

37:53.304 --> 37:54.737
What took you so long?

37:54.872 --> 37:59.241
Well, you took one car and Clarke
took the other and I had to walk.

37:59.377 --> 38:01.845
I swear to God, Peggy.
I'm going to get my hands on him.

38:01.979 --> 38:04.948
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
but I'm gonna do something probably.

38:05.783 --> 38:06.841
Joseph?

38:08.352 --> 38:11.981
I want you to promise me
that you will not hurt him.

38:12.123 --> 38:14.387
You know how humiliating this is?

38:14.525 --> 38:17.653
I got a biker rapist
picking glass out of my ass.

38:17.795 --> 38:19.956
Well, our son could have called.

38:20.097 --> 38:24.329
Am where am I? I am here,
bailing my husband out of jail.

38:24.468 --> 38:27.562
Officer, could you just open this
damn cell door and let me out?

38:31.309 --> 38:35.871
Officer, if I refuse
to take my husband right now,

38:36.013 --> 38:37.776
what is going to happen?

38:37.915 --> 38:40.383
Why, Peggy? You're not
refusing to take your husband.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.749
Well, seeing as though it's the weekend,
the judge won't be here till Monday.

38:46.123 --> 38:49.217
And would he have
to stay here all locked up?

38:49.360 --> 38:50.827
- Hm-hm.
- No.

38:50.961 --> 38:54.863
I don't have to stay locked up here,
because you're getting me out.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.366
- Then I refuse to take my husband.
- What?

38:59.337 --> 39:01.237
I'm gonna go find our son.

39:01.372 --> 39:05.399
And you are never, ever, ever

39:05.543 --> 39:07.909
going to hurt him again.

39:08.045 --> 39:12.880
Peggy, don't get emotional.
You're not supposed to get emotional.

39:13.017 --> 39:15.076
You know what happens when you
get emotional, you get stupid.

39:16.887 --> 39:21.824
Rot!

39:21.959 --> 39:24.723
What's wrong with you?
Bust my fucking eardrum.

39:28.299 --> 39:29.391
Peggy!

39:33.704 --> 39:35.604
Peggy?

39:39.210 --> 39:42.509
- Whoo!
- Dear Diary,

39:42.646 --> 39:45.979
New Mexico is brown and flat.

39:46.117 --> 39:50.076
Mom does most of the driving, because
she thinks that Dad goes too slow.

39:51.122 --> 39:54.489
Daddy is happy, being a man
and all, just navigating.

39:55.226 --> 39:59.094
- He is a most excellent map reader.
- # Shoop-de-bop!

39:59.230 --> 40:02.028
With the division of labor
so neatly divided

40:02.166 --> 40:06.125
and both of them willing to stay in
their designated roles, I'm convinced...

40:06.270 --> 40:07.396
# Funky pops!

40:07.538 --> 40:10.632
...that I have the happiest
family there ever was.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.709
# Coffee, tea or me baby

40:12.843 --> 40:14.367
# Touché ole

40:14.512 --> 40:18.448
# My opening line
might be a bit passé, yes

40:18.582 --> 40:22.211
# But don't think that
I don't know what I'm feeling for you

40:22.353 --> 40:26.346
# 'Cause I got a vibe on you the
first time that I saw you, saw you

40:26.490 --> 40:30.221
# I need your love
and I won't bring no pain

40:30.361 --> 40:33.694
# A little birdie told me
that you feel the same

40:33.831 --> 40:38.063
# I'm for the real
and for you I'm true blue

40:38.202 --> 40:41.660
# Let's make a deal, sugar
all I want to do is

40:41.806 --> 40:46.539
# Be your one and only lover... #

40:46.677 --> 40:47.974
Did you see that guy?

40:49.513 --> 40:52.380
- Pull over.
- Press on we must, Clarke.

40:52.516 --> 40:53.710
Press on we must.

40:53.851 --> 40:55.785
You're the one who keeps saying
you need to get me laid.

41:08.232 --> 41:10.257
Sweetheart, did you
eat something today?

41:10.401 --> 41:13.529
Go on in, I'll whip
you up some flapjacks, OK?

41:13.671 --> 41:15.662
Can I sleep in Danielle's room?

41:15.806 --> 41:17.967
Honey, you can sleep
anywhere you want.

41:20.344 --> 41:22.904
Let's all just go inside.
Put your stuff away.

41:24.482 --> 41:27.178
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

41:27.318 --> 41:31.084
This is incredibly embarrassing,
but I have reason to believe

41:31.222 --> 41:34.020
that my son has
run off with your daughter.

41:34.158 --> 41:36.285
Oh, God, I should never
have left her alone.

41:36.427 --> 41:38.554
Listen, horny children
are the least of my worries.

41:38.696 --> 41:41.358
- They'll turn up, they always do.
- My son is gay!

41:43.334 --> 41:44.596
Oh...

41:47.738 --> 41:49.865
Oh, Lord, I never
said that out loud before.

41:50.774 --> 41:52.241
Are you Clarke's mama?

41:54.378 --> 41:56.039
I've lost my son.

41:57.214 --> 41:58.203
Sue-Ann!

41:58.349 --> 41:59.714
- Yeah?
- Someone broke in!

41:59.850 --> 42:02.318
- There's glass all over your bed.
- What?

42:02.453 --> 42:05.286
- Goodness.
- Oh...

42:05.422 --> 42:09.654
My husband is just a little bit
testy when it comes to our son.

42:09.793 --> 42:11.727
I promise I'll pay for any damages.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.495
Oh, no. Oh, no.

42:37.555 --> 42:38.715
Excuse me.

42:42.259 --> 42:44.284
Are those Bugle Boy jeans
that you're wearing?

42:48.332 --> 42:49.856
It's this one right here.

42:54.805 --> 42:56.636
Hey, Danielle.

42:56.774 --> 42:58.571
Joel here is wondering if we
could drop him off in Vegas?

42:59.143 --> 43:00.667
- I...
- I told him it wouldn't be a problem,

43:00.811 --> 43:02.802
this being my car and everything.

43:02.947 --> 43:04.938
I got a job there waiting for me.

43:05.082 --> 43:07.448
- Listen, Joel...
- And the cool thing is that,

43:07.585 --> 43:09.052
unlike some people...

43:10.421 --> 43:12.355
...Joel is willing
to help out with expenses.

43:12.489 --> 43:15.890
Yeah, I got money,
I just ain't got wheels.

43:16.026 --> 43:17.152
Get in.

43:17.294 --> 43:18.591
Danielle, you don't mind driving do you?

43:19.163 --> 43:20.721
We don't know him.

43:20.864 --> 43:23.332
You said you wanted to think
of a way to thank me?

43:23.467 --> 43:25.867
This is a distraction
from our stated goals.

43:26.003 --> 43:29.837
- You have your destiny, I have mine.
- Fuck.

43:36.347 --> 43:41.842
Dear Diary, it turns out
that Daddy is a big, fat whore.

43:42.686 --> 43:45.587
I'm a lucky girl that I'm
learning such valuable lessons

43:45.723 --> 43:49.181
about the true nature of men.

43:49.326 --> 43:50.987
Oh, you like that.

43:51.128 --> 43:53.653
So what sort of work
do you have in Vegas?

43:53.797 --> 43:55.230
Oh, it went right on my tooth.

43:55.366 --> 43:56.924
I'm a dancer.

43:58.902 --> 44:00.597
Like on Fame.

44:00.738 --> 44:04.037
Well, no. I'm not all that technical.
I'm more free form.

44:04.174 --> 44:07.507
- Can you do splits?
- You dance for tips, right?

44:07.645 --> 44:09.442
That's why you got all them singles.

44:10.247 --> 44:13.307
It's my art. If people want
to give me money for my art,

44:13.450 --> 44:15.247
that just makes me
a professional artist.

44:16.186 --> 44:17.710
Right, you're a stripper.

44:17.855 --> 44:20.653
- Erotic entertainer.
- Stripper.

44:21.425 --> 44:22.221
Ow!

44:22.359 --> 44:25.658
Lots of people can't make
a living doing what they love.

44:25.796 --> 44:26.785
You're lucky.

44:28.098 --> 44:30.623
You get me, don't you? Huh?

44:30.768 --> 44:32.463
- You do, don't you?
- Stop.

44:36.707 --> 44:39.141
- I can do splits, too.
- You are bad.

44:39.276 --> 44:42.643
Are you telling me
my little boy's in California?

44:42.780 --> 44:45.908
- Sue-Ann?
- I kept it from her too long.

44:46.050 --> 44:48.985
- How did this happen?
- Oh, I don't know. I don't know.

44:49.119 --> 44:52.111
We are going to need
to contact Danielle's father.

44:52.256 --> 44:53.689
What? Wait. No.

44:53.824 --> 44:57.817
- Wait a minute.
- Do you have feelings for this... guy?

44:57.961 --> 45:01.294
- No, of course not!
- It's written all over your face.

45:01.432 --> 45:03.559
We have an address.
Do we have a phone number?

45:03.701 --> 45:05.601
You don't understand,
he don't know about her.

45:05.736 --> 45:08.102
I don't know what I would say.
I thought this part of my life was over.

45:08.238 --> 45:09.296
- It is over!
- Look, Ray!

45:09.440 --> 45:10.998
Don't be like that, all right?

45:11.141 --> 45:13.507
Now this is a minor,
little big deal, OK?

45:13.644 --> 45:15.635
I'm gonna take care of it and
then we're gonna be real happy.

45:15.779 --> 45:19.510
This guy pops up out of nowhere,
putting all my plans in peril.

45:19.650 --> 45:23.518
- If you could see yourself.
- I am doing the best that I can!

45:23.654 --> 45:28.785
All right, everybody, calm down!
Jesus H. Christ!

45:28.926 --> 45:34.330
Look, there is obviously a lot of
feelings swirling around this place.

45:34.465 --> 45:36.660
But we need to stay focused.

45:36.800 --> 45:40.201
- Do you love me?
- This isn't about you, sir.

45:40.337 --> 45:43.272
- Of course I do.
- This is about our children.

45:43.407 --> 45:45.602
Now, as a father,
you should understand that.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.142
Daddy?

45:49.012 --> 45:50.946
I need to go after her, Ray.

45:52.850 --> 45:54.545
And then you'll come back to me?

45:56.120 --> 45:57.712
Of course I will.

46:02.493 --> 46:03.926
Go get our girl.

46:09.133 --> 46:13.502
- I'm a shitty mother.
- Join the club.

46:17.107 --> 46:20.406
- This is on you, right?
- Sure thing.

46:27.551 --> 46:30.418
Oh, he is so fine.

46:31.822 --> 46:33.983
He's not gonna fuck you, Clarke.

46:34.124 --> 46:37.525
Just telling you.
So start getting used to the idea.

46:37.661 --> 46:40.721
If you were a real friend,
you wouldn't say stuff like that.

46:40.864 --> 46:42.695
- Clarke.
- I gotta pee.

46:50.307 --> 46:51.467
Hey.

46:56.580 --> 46:59.549
Well, I sure do
appreciate your hospitality,

46:59.683 --> 47:01.548
giving me a ride and all.

47:01.685 --> 47:05.018
If you make him any promises,
you best follow through, motherfucker!

47:09.259 --> 47:10.988
Now we got a nice tailwind,

47:11.128 --> 47:14.461
so our flight time to Bakersfield
should be just under three hours.

47:14.598 --> 47:16.657
Sit back and enjoy the flight.

47:37.054 --> 47:39.420
And I thought the
Boy Scouts taught me nothing.

47:41.024 --> 47:43.322
Out of all the hitchhikers in the world,

47:43.460 --> 47:46.122
how did we get one
so masculine and capable?

47:46.263 --> 47:49.130
Oh, well, you learn a few things
when you're on your own.

47:52.903 --> 47:56.339
- Were you a Boy Scout, Clarke?
- For like a week in second grade.

47:56.473 --> 48:01.069
They... They gave us these boxes
of candy to sell door to door.

48:01.211 --> 48:04.237
I ate all mine,
so my mom gave me the money

48:04.381 --> 48:06.872
to buy the whole box,
so I wouldn't get in trouble.

48:07.718 --> 48:10.186
My dad was so mad.

48:10.320 --> 48:12.345
Said the two of us was in cahoots.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.427
My daddy took off when I was little.

48:21.765 --> 48:22.789
Like Dani's.

48:24.468 --> 48:26.629
Mine took off
before I was born, so I win.

48:28.472 --> 48:29.666
Are we competing?

48:30.941 --> 48:32.875
I'm just saying I probably had it worse.

48:34.945 --> 48:37.140
You know what it's like then,
don't you?

48:39.149 --> 48:41.379
That crazy thing when you
look for him everywhere.

48:42.986 --> 48:46.581
Anytime you're in a crowd,
there's a chance, so you...

48:46.723 --> 48:51.353
...walk around a little straighter,
hoping to look your best, just in case.

48:55.866 --> 48:58.664
Looking everywhere for somebody
who don't want to be found.

49:07.344 --> 49:09.278
I want to hear more about your art.

49:09.880 --> 49:11.404
Show us.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.016
- You guys are crazy.
- Come on.

49:20.891 --> 49:25.055
We got the music,
and the fancy lighting.

49:25.195 --> 49:29.063
- All that's missing is a pole.
- It's cold out.

49:29.199 --> 49:32.032
Keeps everything perky.

49:33.637 --> 49:37.038
Aw, this one's too fast.
I only dance to the slow ones.

49:37.808 --> 49:38.968
It's kind of my signature.

49:40.911 --> 49:42.936
All right, this one's a ballad.

49:51.488 --> 49:54.616
I cannot believe I'm doing this
out in the middle of nowhere.

49:56.493 --> 49:57.892
You best appreciate it.

49:58.996 --> 50:01.226
I promise I do.

50:01.365 --> 50:04.630
OK, see now, the trick is
to dance in your own world.

50:07.004 --> 50:08.835
Let them come to you.

52:49.299 --> 52:50.527
Joel?

53:00.610 --> 53:01.907
Hey.

53:04.114 --> 53:07.083
I know you don't want
to hear this right now,

53:07.217 --> 53:08.809
but you will get over it.

53:08.952 --> 53:11.318
I fell in love last night,
and now he's gone.

53:12.789 --> 53:16.350
- My one chance at happiness.
- Stop acting like a girl.

53:16.493 --> 53:18.461
You drove him away.

53:18.595 --> 53:21.359
Clarke, I'm gonna stop
this conversation right now

53:21.498 --> 53:24.126
until you adjust your thinking.

53:24.267 --> 53:27.794
Welcome to life, Clarke, you're
just another tainted grown-up.

53:27.938 --> 53:29.929
Jesus Christ.

53:31.074 --> 53:33.474
There's no room in this world
for a love like ours.

53:34.611 --> 53:35.703
They hate us for it.

53:40.584 --> 53:42.449
Shit! No.

53:44.120 --> 53:47.453
Shit. Shit, shit, shit!

53:59.803 --> 54:04.900
Agh! Stupid, fucking shit car!

54:05.041 --> 54:06.906
Joel would know what
to do if he where here.

54:08.778 --> 54:11.542
- We'd best start walking.
- Yes, you'd best.

54:11.681 --> 54:14.047
Clarke, let's go.

54:14.184 --> 54:17.153
You're the one with
the reason to live. You walk.

54:21.424 --> 54:23.119
OK. You know what?

54:23.260 --> 54:27.390
When I get to the next town
I'm gonna call your father! Agh!

54:28.331 --> 54:29.320
- Fuck!
- Fine!

54:47.217 --> 54:49.014
Do I look OK?

54:49.786 --> 54:51.754
He is gonna die.

55:14.144 --> 55:16.510
All right, mister.
Your time is up.

55:19.883 --> 55:21.407
We found your car.

55:24.287 --> 55:25.515
You found it?

55:27.390 --> 55:28.823
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

55:28.958 --> 55:32.792
- Do y'all have a pillow I could use?
- Sure.

55:41.471 --> 55:43.905
One tank of gas, $15.

55:44.040 --> 55:46.235
I'll have my dad give you
a ride back to your car.

55:46.376 --> 55:48.537
Will that be cash or charge?

55:48.678 --> 55:50.873
- Charge.
- Cash.

55:51.014 --> 55:54.040
I am sick of paying your way.
You're hateful, and ungrateful.

55:54.184 --> 55:57.483
- Don't be an asshole.
- You got an emergency fund.

55:58.054 --> 55:59.453
Use it.

56:00.623 --> 56:02.523
I can't.

56:02.659 --> 56:05.526
Why spend your own money when you
can spend somebody else's, right?

56:07.464 --> 56:09.159
I don't have it anymore.

56:10.367 --> 56:11.629
You spent it?

56:12.535 --> 56:14.435
The only cash we have?

56:16.139 --> 56:18.664
You are a selfish bitch.

56:20.710 --> 56:23.235
- What did you buy yourself, huh?
- It's what I bought you!

56:28.051 --> 56:31.782
I wanted to do something nice
for you, to thank you.

56:35.992 --> 56:37.016
Hm?

56:38.128 --> 56:40.392
And you liked him so much.

56:42.699 --> 56:44.530
He didn't think I was sexy.

56:46.002 --> 56:50.701
I'm sure he did.
It was just extra encouragement.

56:58.014 --> 56:59.675
Clarke!

57:09.859 --> 57:11.554
I need your credit card.

57:22.338 --> 57:25.136
That's what I get
for marrying a faggot.

57:27.510 --> 57:29.000
This'll just be a minute.

57:32.015 --> 57:33.676
Collect, from Clarke.

57:34.651 --> 57:38.553
- Clarke, run! Run! Shit! Uh...
- What?

57:38.688 --> 57:41.816
Hey, get back here!
Come on, Dad, come on!

57:41.958 --> 57:43.186
What the fuck?

57:43.326 --> 57:45.021
I'm gonna call the cops,
you stay with them!

57:45.161 --> 57:48.062
Your card's been reported stolen!
They're gonna know where we are!

57:48.198 --> 57:49.290
Shit! Shit!

57:49.432 --> 57:51.229
Danielle wait up,
where you going?

58:03.279 --> 58:05.611
Hey. I want to enter
the stripping competition.

58:05.748 --> 58:07.511
- Where's the sign-up sheet?
- You're looking at him.

58:07.650 --> 58:10.915
- Great.
- It wouldn't exactly be appropriate.

58:11.054 --> 58:13.284
I'm young,
but I got the moves. Trust me.

58:13.423 --> 58:16.449
- He'll vouch for me, OK?
- She's done her research.

58:16.593 --> 58:20.154
That prize money's mine.
Come on, give me a chance.

58:20.296 --> 58:21.786
Jade wins every night.

58:21.931 --> 58:25.799
But if you think you can win
these boys over, be my guest.

58:25.935 --> 58:29.735
Mister, you don't know
who you're dealing with.

58:40.416 --> 58:42.179
Let's hear it for Jade!

58:44.254 --> 58:47.155
Beginning of the second chorus,
that's when you throw the water on me.

58:47.290 --> 58:49.986
- You got it?
- Dani, you don't have to do this.

58:52.195 --> 58:54.823
- Don't look at me like that.
- Like what?

58:54.964 --> 58:56.898
Like you don't approve.

58:57.033 --> 59:01.402
Just, don't show them nothing, OK?

59:02.872 --> 59:05.773
- I won't.
- Promise?

59:05.909 --> 59:08.844
I'll just bat my eyelids
and shake my shoulders.

59:09.679 --> 59:11.909
- I'm sure Jade's got nothing on me.
- Sure.

59:13.216 --> 59:15.707
- You got a better idea?
- We can go home.

59:21.057 --> 59:23.491
- Got your music?
- Yeah.

59:25.728 --> 59:27.423
You're up, young'un.

59:30.033 --> 59:31.159
Second chorus, Clarke.

59:33.069 --> 59:37.369
For all you boys who like
'em young, we got a special treat.

59:37.507 --> 59:41.637
A little lady thinks she can
unseat the undisputed champion.

59:41.778 --> 59:46.738
Direct from Tornado Alley,
90 pounds of dynamite!

59:47.750 --> 59:49.718
It's Danielle!

01:00:07.203 --> 01:00:08.795
Get off my stage!

01:00:39.135 --> 01:00:42.434
- Tough crowd.
- Them boys like it from Jade.

01:00:42.572 --> 01:00:45.006
Ain't nobody sexier than Danielle.

01:00:49.646 --> 01:00:52.672
Oh! I beg your pardon.

01:00:54.817 --> 01:00:57.809
Oh, my God. They're gay! Dani, stop!

01:01:00.056 --> 01:01:02.581
- They're gay, Dani!
- What?

01:01:02.725 --> 01:01:04.750
- They're gay.
- But they're so ugly.

01:01:04.894 --> 01:01:06.919
- Let's get you out of here.
- No.

01:01:07.063 --> 01:01:09.793
- We can't give up now.
- Danielle, they don't like you.

01:01:10.967 --> 01:01:13.401
- You have to do it.
- I can't.

01:01:13.536 --> 01:01:15.936
- Yes, you can.
- I am not like you.

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:20.533
What would Joel do?

01:01:23.913 --> 01:01:28.680
OK, see now, the trick
is to dance in your own world.

01:01:30.253 --> 01:01:32.244
Let 'em come to you.

01:01:48.771 --> 01:01:50.864
Yeah!

01:01:58.047 --> 01:02:00.038
Whoo!

01:02:20.770 --> 01:02:23.705
- By an overwhelming majority...
- Jesus Christ!

01:02:23.840 --> 01:02:26.536
...and winner of
the 50-dollar prize money,

01:02:26.676 --> 01:02:30.009
- the new champ is...
- Clarke!

01:02:31.948 --> 01:02:35.714
This is fucking kidnapping,
you ugly motherfucker!

01:02:35.852 --> 01:02:39.310
Hey! I don't need any of your
goddamn lip! And don't you hit my car!

01:02:39.455 --> 01:02:42.049
It's because of you my son's
gone completely off the deep end.

01:02:42.191 --> 01:02:45.285
Your son was a miserable, whiny,

01:02:45.428 --> 01:02:47.726
dishrag before I got my hands on him.

01:02:47.864 --> 01:02:50.890
Yeah, and you turned him into
a full-blown cocksucker, didn't you?

01:02:51.501 --> 01:02:52.968
It's over for you, boy.

01:02:53.102 --> 01:02:55.195
Soon as we drop your
little friend off here,

01:02:55.338 --> 01:02:57.135
your ass is going straight
to the military academy.

01:02:58.574 --> 01:03:00.201
I'm gonna pull this car
over right now, goddamn it,

01:03:00.343 --> 01:03:03.710
- and set your ass at the curb.
- And what are you gonna do, huh?

01:03:03.846 --> 01:03:06.246
Smack her around?
Knock some sense into her?

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.974
That's enough of your shit, Clarke.

01:03:09.685 --> 01:03:12.518
I'll tell you what. I like cocks.

01:03:12.655 --> 01:03:14.452
Jesus Christ!
What did you just say, Clarke?!

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:18.390
- I like the dreamy, creamy taste...
- Shut the fuck up, Clarke!

01:03:18.528 --> 01:03:22.225
Somebody pass me a cracker
for all that dick cheese!

01:03:25.868 --> 01:03:27.859
God! Jesus Christ!

01:03:28.004 --> 01:03:29.904
Take the money, take Joan,

01:03:30.039 --> 01:03:31.768
- and get out of here.
- I mean her, I know!

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.933
If I'm good at anything,
it's how to take a punch. Trust me.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:36.670
- OK, when I say run, you run. OK?
- Hey, don't touch him!

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.644
You don't say that
kind of shit to your dad!

01:03:38.781 --> 01:03:42.774
- Get off me!
- Don't you hurt him!

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:46.047
Go! Run, Dani, run!

01:03:46.189 --> 01:03:49.249
- Run, Dani!
- Fuck!

01:03:49.392 --> 01:03:51.622
Why the fuck are you like this?

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.627
Dear Diary...

01:04:32.735 --> 01:04:34.396
...Daddy had to leave.

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:37.764
As daddies sometimes do.

01:04:42.011 --> 01:04:45.174
He left so the dreams of
our family could come true.

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.643
But Mommy will soldier on.

01:04:53.189 --> 01:04:56.420
Because that is what mommies do.

01:05:39.669 --> 01:05:41.967
We're here.

01:06:20.009 --> 01:06:21.340
Where's my father?

01:06:22.178 --> 01:06:23.668
Danielle.

01:06:25.114 --> 01:06:27.241
We should just head on home now, OK?

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.384
- Is that his wife?
- Yes, it is.

01:06:30.519 --> 01:06:32.919
- Can I go say hello to her?
- No, you may not.

01:06:33.055 --> 01:06:35.023
We have caused these people
enough trouble.

01:06:35.157 --> 01:06:38.388
Can I come in? I'm really tired
and I need to use the restroom.

01:06:38.527 --> 01:06:41.155
Taxi! Wait, please, thank you.

01:06:41.297 --> 01:06:42.787
Where's my boy?

01:06:43.899 --> 01:06:45.867
His daddy found us.

01:06:46.002 --> 01:06:49.267
If he is hurt, I'm going to hold you
personally responsible, young lady.

01:06:49.405 --> 01:06:51.532
- OK, OK...
- Let go!

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.606
No, no! No!

01:06:53.743 --> 01:06:56.735
You... You get back here!

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:57.937
You get back here.

01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.411
You listen to your mama!

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:03.546
You come back here! Baby!

01:07:23.739 --> 01:07:24.933
Come on.

01:07:34.417 --> 01:07:35.475
Danny Briggs?

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.791
You must be Sue-Ann's little girl.

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.394
Uh-huh.

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:51.659
Damned if you ain't
the spitting image of your mama.

01:07:51.801 --> 01:07:53.132
Yeah...

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.733
People think we're sisters all the time.

01:07:59.608 --> 01:08:02.577
- You can't be here!
- It's OK, Janet.

01:08:04.346 --> 01:08:06.177
Daniel, this is not what we discussed.

01:08:06.315 --> 01:08:08.112
Just go back inside, all right?

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:10.718
It's fine. Just go inside, let us talk.

01:08:11.821 --> 01:08:12.810
Go on.

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:21.060
Hey...

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.731
Don't mind her, she's a little upset.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:31.731
Them boys you sold the house to, told
me she was kind of high-strung, and all.

01:08:31.874 --> 01:08:34.171
I was prepared in my mentality.

01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:40.075
That makes you a pretty smart girl.

01:08:49.325 --> 01:08:55.229
You know, the secret to making
a good burger is to only flip it once.

01:08:59.801 --> 01:09:02.236
- Hey.
- I knew... I knew it.

01:09:04.206 --> 01:09:07.073
It's OK. It's OK.

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.361
These last few days have been
really strange for me, Danielle.

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.738
I hadn't seen your mom
in such a long time.

01:09:39.008 --> 01:09:42.238
Yeah, it must be weird.

01:09:42.377 --> 01:09:44.538
Yeah, weird's a good word. It was weird.

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:46.443
Super-duper weird.

01:09:46.582 --> 01:09:49.050
Even better, super-duper weird.
I like that one.

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.051
Danielle, I didn't know about you.

01:09:59.295 --> 01:10:01.786
- She didn't tell you?
- No.

01:10:01.931 --> 01:10:03.262
I mean...

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:08.031
I thought she was gonna get rid of it.

01:10:18.747 --> 01:10:24.151
I'm... I'm not proud
of myself, Danielle.

01:10:26.355 --> 01:10:28.016
She decided to keep me?

01:10:30.826 --> 01:10:32.293
I had no idea.

01:10:37.333 --> 01:10:38.732
You know what this means?

01:10:42.004 --> 01:10:43.062
What?

01:10:43.205 --> 01:10:45.673
It means I don't have to forgive you
for running out on us.

01:10:45.808 --> 01:10:47.537
And I was kind of
looking forward to that.

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:53.042
It would mean a lot to me
if you did just that.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.945
If you'd forgive me.

01:10:58.721 --> 01:10:59.983
Done.

01:11:06.862 --> 01:11:10.229
Bet you missed a lot of school
coming to see me like this.

01:11:11.333 --> 01:11:13.563
Only a couple of days.
I brought my homework.

01:11:13.702 --> 01:11:15.169
Well, you gotta be
in a hurry to get back.

01:11:15.304 --> 01:11:17.295
I mean, your friends,
this time of year in school...

01:11:17.439 --> 01:11:19.407
I don't know what Sue-Ann told you...

01:11:21.176 --> 01:11:25.078
...but our situation ain't really ideal.

01:11:25.214 --> 01:11:28.047
And I know it's a shock,
me being here and all.

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:30.851
But if it would be all right,

01:11:30.986 --> 01:11:32.749
and I know it would take
a lot of adjusting...

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:35.083
Honey, honey...

01:11:36.525 --> 01:11:37.787
You can't stay here.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:40.558
I'd keep my room real nice.

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.461
Danielle, I'm a stranger to you.

01:11:48.003 --> 01:11:49.436
You're my daddy.

01:11:59.048 --> 01:12:01.642
You seem like you're
a really sweet girl.

01:12:02.918 --> 01:12:05.580
And I know that I'd be
very proud of you.

01:12:05.721 --> 01:12:08.952
Don't bet on it.

01:12:09.091 --> 01:12:10.991
But you just...

01:12:11.126 --> 01:12:13.117
Daddy? Who's that?

01:12:13.262 --> 01:12:15.355
Sweetie, this is one of my students.

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:18.091
Why don't you run on back inside,
OK, and finish your nap?

01:12:21.937 --> 01:12:24.030
- Hi.
- What's your name?

01:12:24.173 --> 01:12:27.574
Danielle. What's yours?

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:30.838
- Tiffany. And you know what?
- What?

01:12:30.979 --> 01:12:34.380
My daddy's taking me
to Disneyland on my birthday.

01:12:34.516 --> 01:12:38.748
Wow, that makes you a really lucky girl.

01:12:38.887 --> 01:12:40.821
Hey, hey, the tickle monster's coming.

01:12:40.956 --> 01:12:42.218
Where you going?

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.354
Got you, I got you!

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:55.091
I want you to go upstairs and be a
good girl and finish your nap now, OK?

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:58.901
- Bye, Danielle.
- Bye, Tiffany.

01:13:01.810 --> 01:13:03.072
I'm sorry about that.

01:13:05.581 --> 01:13:09.244
- She's real cute.
- Yes, she is.

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.183
Yeah.

01:13:12.321 --> 01:13:14.755
I bet she's your pride and joy.

01:13:16.825 --> 01:13:18.019
You could say that.

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:26.592
I think I need to go, huh?

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.830
Probably be a good idea.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:50.424
Mommy.

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:00.428
Oh, my baby.

01:14:02.404 --> 01:14:04.395
Oh, my baby.

01:14:04.540 --> 01:14:06.030
Oh, my baby.

01:14:10.245 --> 01:14:13.009
I'm so stupid.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:22.218
Oh, God, I love you.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.627
Will you help me?

01:15:09.404 --> 01:15:10.632
Sure.

01:15:20.983 --> 01:15:23.451
Oh, isn't he something, that hair?

01:15:23.585 --> 01:15:26.076
Yeah, I think he's cute, that one.

01:15:26.221 --> 01:15:29.384
He's got beautiful eyes.
Oh, he's dreamy.

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.323
Maybe I'll hang this up in my room.

01:15:32.461 --> 01:15:34.725
I think Ray wouldn't
like that very much.

01:15:36.298 --> 01:15:38.027
I think this one's cute, up here.

01:15:38.166 --> 01:15:42.500
Yeah, he is. You are so bad.

01:15:42.638 --> 01:15:46.165
You're my daughter.
You learned from the best.

01:15:54.650 --> 01:15:57.949
- Mrs. Gardner.
- What are you doing here?

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:02.079
- I wanted to see how Clarke's doing.
- Oh.

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:07.694
Well, um... he's gonna be fine.

01:16:07.829 --> 01:16:10.923
- It's all gonna be fine.
- Is he at that school?

01:16:12.668 --> 01:16:13.930
There's a lot going on here,

01:16:14.069 --> 01:16:16.629
so that's the best place
for him right now.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:19.398
Where's his daddy?

01:16:20.108 --> 01:16:22.770
He's getting himself a little apartment.

01:16:24.179 --> 01:16:26.477
I broke up your family.

01:16:29.117 --> 01:16:30.379
I'm so sorry.

01:16:31.019 --> 01:16:33.180
You did not break up our family.

01:16:34.423 --> 01:16:37.722
You have all these ideas about
what it is to be a good parent.

01:16:37.859 --> 01:16:41.295
And everybody says that if you just
do your best, that's all that matters.

01:16:41.430 --> 01:16:44.558
But... it's not true.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:49.399
I mean, if your best stinks,
then what good are you?

01:16:50.973 --> 01:16:53.441
I don't mean to do you
no disrespect, ma'am...

01:16:54.910 --> 01:16:57.003
...but Clarke would rather be with you.

01:17:09.091 --> 01:17:10.353
Danielle.

01:17:14.062 --> 01:17:15.825
Tell your mama I said hello.

01:17:22.871 --> 01:17:24.600
I guess you
could say our little girl's

01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:29.734
been through
a whole lot in her short life.

01:17:29.878 --> 01:17:32.574
She's learned that sometimes

01:17:32.714 --> 01:17:36.115
you got to accept
what life throws at you.

01:17:36.251 --> 01:17:40.881
But only after a really good fight,
to find out what you're made of.

01:17:42.924 --> 01:17:46.087
It's the fight that makes
the accepting bearable.

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:47.991
Very nice, Danielle.

01:17:48.130 --> 01:17:49.654
- I'm not done.
- OK.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.833
She also misses her daddy a whole lot.

01:17:57.039 --> 01:18:00.475
And hopes that someday her family
will be brought back together...

01:18:01.476 --> 01:18:03.171
...'cause it's real fun.

01:18:11.453 --> 01:18:13.421
You've come
a long way, Danielle.

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:16.149
Miss Hatcher says you're doing great,
that you're more involved.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:18.849
I even hear you signed up
for the talent show.

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:21.724
I'm working on being a more
traditional type of person.

01:18:21.863 --> 01:18:25.959
I might be taking a risk here,
but if you promise that I can trust you,

01:18:26.101 --> 01:18:28.069
I'll put you back with the normal kids.

01:18:30.105 --> 01:18:31.902
Can I trust you?

01:18:36.845 --> 01:18:37.971
Good.

01:19:02.637 --> 01:19:04.969
Let's hear it for Perpetual Motion.

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:14.140
And now...

01:19:14.282 --> 01:19:18.150
...for the musical stylings
of Miss Danielle Edmonston.

01:19:36.304 --> 01:19:38.499
Clarke wanted this here to be a duet.

01:19:38.640 --> 01:19:42.940
May sound corny,
but this is for my baby's daddy.

01:19:44.379 --> 01:19:46.370
And this here's his favorite song.

01:19:48.216 --> 01:19:52.778
# Baby cried the day
the circus came to town

01:19:54.623 --> 01:19:59.720
# 'Cause she didn't want
parades just passing by her

01:20:00.896 --> 01:20:05.924
# So she painted on a smile
and took off with some clown

01:20:07.402 --> 01:20:12.271
# And she danced
without a net up on the wire

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:19.311
# I know a lot about her
'cause you see

01:20:20.382 --> 01:20:24.819
# Baby is an awful lot like me

01:20:27.055 --> 01:20:31.754
# Don't cry out loud

01:20:31.893 --> 01:20:35.420
# Just keep it inside

01:20:35.564 --> 01:20:39.295
# Learn how to hide your feelings

01:20:39.434 --> 01:20:44.599
# Fly high and proud

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:47.970
# And if you should fall

01:20:48.109 --> 01:20:54.105
# Remember you almost had it all

01:20:58.253 --> 01:21:02.053
# Baby saw that when they
pulled the big top down

01:21:04.025 --> 01:21:09.986
# They left behind her dreams
among the litter

01:21:10.131 --> 01:21:14.727
# And the different
kind of love she thought she'd found

01:21:15.971 --> 01:21:21.910
# There's nothing there
but sawdust and some glitter

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:27.913
# But baby can't be broken
'cause you see

01:21:28.049 --> 01:21:33.180
# She had the finest teacher,
that was...

01:21:33.321 --> 01:21:34.913
# I taught her...

01:21:35.056 --> 01:21:39.117
# Don't cry out loud

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:41.786
# Just keep it inside

01:21:41.930 --> 01:21:46.128
# Learn how to hide your feelings

01:21:46.268 --> 01:21:51.035
# Fly high and proud

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:54.005
# And if you should fall

01:21:54.142 --> 01:22:00.138
# Remember you almost had it all

01:22:09.424 --> 01:22:13.793
# Don't cry out loud

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:16.727
# Just keep it inside

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:20.995
# Learn how to hide your feelings

01:22:21.136 --> 01:22:25.266
# Fly high and proud

01:22:25.407 --> 01:22:28.672
# And if you should fall

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:33.747
# Remember you almost had it all #

01:22:33.882 --> 01:22:36.214
Dear Diary,

01:22:36.351 --> 01:22:38.581
this world is full of dipshits.

01:22:38.720 --> 01:22:41.883
But guess what?
Mommy got a fairy-tale ending.

01:22:42.691 --> 01:22:43.919
Because Daddy?

01:22:44.793 --> 01:22:46.784
Daddy came back.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.930
So they let you out
for good behavior or something?

01:22:56.071 --> 01:22:59.131
My mama came and got me.
Said she was compelled.

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:01.501
What did you do to your hair?

01:23:01.643 --> 01:23:03.838
- You don't like it?
- Hell, no.

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.782
Better? I'm glad you're back.

01:23:11.386 --> 01:23:12.853
I don't know, I kind of miss that place.

01:23:12.988 --> 01:23:14.285
Shut up.

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:15.946
In a school with no girls,
I was very popular.

01:23:16.091 --> 01:23:19.356
- You fucking whore.
- Thank you.

01:23:19.494 --> 01:23:22.258
Remember, Clarke,
nobody likes a dirty girl.

01:23:22.897 --> 01:23:24.489
Right.
