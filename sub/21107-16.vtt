20:31.965 --> 20:33.764
Well, that was disgusting.

20:33.766 --> 20:37.201
And it's only going to get
worse, baby Drac.

20:37.203 --> 20:40.605
I'm staying
till the bitter split end.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.240
(LAUGHING)

20:42.242 --> 20:44.308
Battle lice, ready!

20:45.110 --> 20:47.945
Unless...
(WHISTLING)

20:49.781 --> 20:53.351
Oh, no! No! Oh, no!
Oh, no, you don't!

20:53.685 --> 20:56.087
(LAUGHING)
(RAZOR BUZZING)

20:56.089 --> 20:57.688
You wouldn't dare.

20:57.690 --> 20:59.257
Oh, wouldn't I?

21:02.861 --> 21:04.895
(BOTH SHOUTING)

21:08.033 --> 21:09.967
(WHIMPERING)

21:09.969 --> 21:12.270
I'll see y'all
at your funerals!

21:12.272 --> 21:13.571
(YELLING)

21:13.573 --> 21:15.773
Medusa!

21:15.775 --> 21:18.042
(ALL SHOUTING)

21:20.779 --> 21:22.546
I did it!
Aunt Lydia!

21:22.548 --> 21:23.547
I got Medusa!

21:23.549 --> 21:26.784
Everything worked out
perfectly after all!

21:27.819 --> 21:29.453
(GROANING)

21:32.524 --> 21:36.027
Okay, maybe
not perfectly.

21:36.428 --> 21:40.865
So, Medusa, again,
really sorry about
shrinking you and all.

21:40.867 --> 21:45.903
Do you think maybe you could
leave that detail out
next time you're on TV?

21:45.905 --> 21:47.138
No chance.

21:47.140 --> 21:48.506
As soon as I'm out of here,

21:48.508 --> 21:51.542
I'm telling
the whole underworld.

21:51.544 --> 21:56.247
Um, when exactly do you think
we might get out of here?

21:56.249 --> 21:56.681
(MAVIS SIGHING)

21:56.683 --> 22:00.551
I'm guessing at least not
until her hair grows back.

22:01.553 --> 22:03.287
(CLICKING TONGUE)

22:04.256 --> 22:05.690
Ugh.

22:06.358 --> 22:08.292
(MUSIC PLAYING)

22:09.661 --> 22:12.496
(VOCALIZING)
