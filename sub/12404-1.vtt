00:12.327 --> 00:16.035
That state of simplest
form of awareness alone,

00:16.117 --> 00:20.952
"is worthy of seeing, hearing,
contemplating and realizing."

00:22.036 --> 00:24.078
From the Upanishads.

02:23.090 --> 02:25.841
That day, I was going
to meet my sister for lunch.

02:25.924 --> 02:29.924
I emailed her that morning,
just to confirm what time,

02:30.007 --> 02:32.341
and I didn't hear anything back.

02:33.842 --> 02:37.050
Thinking, "It's really strange
how Lotje hasn't got back to me."

02:37.133 --> 02:40.092
You know, because I had also texted,
"Are you okay?"

02:40.175 --> 02:45.218
Which is, like, quite a strong, um...
message.

02:45.301 --> 02:47.760
And I was sure that she would text back.

02:49.051 --> 02:51.385
Usually, you know,
she comes into work every day.

02:51.468 --> 02:55.719
She didn't come in on the Monday,
and, uh, I thought it was a bit weird.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.052
I, um, walked, like,
four, five minutes to where her flat was.

03:01.135 --> 03:03.845
And that's where Jan was with Ant,

03:03.928 --> 03:07.553
looking more and more confused
by what was going on.

03:08.720 --> 03:10.696
We tried to bang on the door...

03:10.720 --> 03:13.513
...shout, but she wasn't responding.

03:13.596 --> 03:16.054
I remember Jan
kind of calling out, "Lotje!"

03:19.929 --> 03:21.569
What was going through our minds was that

03:21.597 --> 03:24.013
there's only one reason why
she'd still be in her flat.

03:27.097 --> 03:30.222
At that point,
I decided to call 999.

03:32.640 --> 03:36.972
The police arrived together
with the landlord, who had a key.

03:37.056 --> 03:39.074
And there was this very strange
moment of, like,

03:39.098 --> 03:43.015
the police holding Jan back a bit, saying,
"Do you want us to go in first?"

03:43.099 --> 03:46.724
The guy who opened the door, not wanting
to be the first guy to go in there.

03:46.808 --> 03:50.140
It was all very strange.
And Jan just said, "I'm going in."

03:56.683 --> 04:01.184
The flat just looked like
some serious chaos had happened.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.393
You know, I was like,
"Shit, where is she?"

04:03.476 --> 04:05.309
Everything was Topsy-turvy.

04:05.393 --> 04:09.309
There was clothes everywhere,
there was vomit

04:09.393 --> 04:11.602
and excrement everywhere.

04:13.935 --> 04:17.560
The fact that she wasn't there
was sort of a relief.

04:18.351 --> 04:21.644
But then the next question was,
"Where is she?"

04:27.645 --> 04:32.145
Lotje's always been quite good at
going somewhere, to adventures,

04:32.229 --> 04:34.729
and experiencing...
Going and seeing friends, so...

04:34.813 --> 04:37.978
I've had this throughout my life.

04:38.062 --> 04:40.522
"Where is Lotje?" has been a question.

04:40.605 --> 04:42.397
You know, you go to the supermarket

04:42.438 --> 04:46.480
and you pick something from the shelf,
"Where is Lotje?"

04:46.563 --> 04:48.856
Where is Lotje?

04:58.022 --> 05:03.023
Somebody at Royal London
fitted Lotje's description.

05:03.107 --> 05:06.732
They couldn't identify her,
because she wasn't able to speak.

05:06.816 --> 05:09.650
The police that I'd called
and the police at the Royal London

05:09.733 --> 05:13.358
managed to, sort of, work out
that this was my sister.

05:17.024 --> 05:20.192
To see a young patient
who is semi-conscious,

05:20.275 --> 05:24.734
who is actually becoming
more unconscious as time goes by,

05:24.818 --> 05:27.235
with the speed that she was deteriorating,

05:27.318 --> 05:29.110
really, you're faced with a situation

05:29.193 --> 05:33.735
where you have to decide
to act urgently and save a life.

05:34.610 --> 05:36.193
We arrived at the hospital,

05:36.276 --> 05:40.403
where it was explained that Lotje
was undergoing some kind of

05:40.486 --> 05:44.069
very severe medical emergency
to her brain.

05:44.152 --> 05:47.737
And that she had
a very high probability of... of dying.

05:48.445 --> 05:51.278
She'd had an intracerebral
brain hemorrhage.

05:51.362 --> 05:55.153
My initial reaction about this
was that this was a very large blood clot

05:55.237 --> 05:57.571
and it was immediately life-threatening.

06:01.696 --> 06:05.113
I must say that a lot of these cases
are so severe

06:05.196 --> 06:10.114
that it isn't possible to intervene,
or if you do, you are unsuccessful.

06:14.406 --> 06:17.948
The surgery involved
an incision on the scalp,

06:18.031 --> 06:20.031
the removal of a small window of bone,

06:20.115 --> 06:21.740
approximately that size,

06:21.824 --> 06:24.698
just a small cut
through the brain substance itself

06:24.782 --> 06:26.408
to reveal the blood clot,

06:26.449 --> 06:29.616
and then to remove
as much of the blood clot as possible.

06:29.699 --> 06:31.866
Now, that doesn't necessarily mitigate

06:31.949 --> 06:34.699
the damage that's been done
by the bleed into the brain.

06:34.783 --> 06:38.200
That is damage that is done
and can't really be reversed.

06:39.492 --> 06:43.826
The commonest type of stroke
is actually an area of the brain

06:43.908 --> 06:47.951
that is starved of oxygen
and loses its blood supply.

06:48.034 --> 06:52.243
Lotje's type of stroke
is a bleed into the brain substance.

06:53.034 --> 06:56.577
Most of them are caused
by either an abnormal blood vessel

06:56.661 --> 07:00.952
that may be developmental,
it can be blood-clotting abnormalities,

07:01.035 --> 07:04.161
and there are a lot of rare things
that can cause it.

07:04.911 --> 07:07.537
There are still some tests to be done
later down the line,

07:07.620 --> 07:12.412
but at the moment, we don't have
a clear cause for why this happened.

07:12.453 --> 07:14.579
It may well be that we never find one,

07:14.663 --> 07:16.954
and it may well be
we never know the cause.

07:20.871 --> 07:24.205
They kept her artificially asleep.

07:24.288 --> 07:28.247
It seemed that they had no idea
if they'd even be able to wake her up.

07:28.330 --> 07:31.955
Or if she woke up,
what her functions would be.

07:32.038 --> 07:33.790
So during that whole 24 hours,

07:33.873 --> 07:36.706
we literally had no idea
what the outcome would be.

08:13.210 --> 08:15.210
Okay.

08:15.293 --> 08:16.960
I'm alive.

08:18.335 --> 08:21.837
Very bad at writing...

08:23.753 --> 08:26.420
...but I'm not dead.

08:28.002 --> 08:30.420
That's a start.

08:30.461 --> 08:32.712
Very messed up...

08:32.796 --> 08:37.087
but definitely excited to be alive.

08:40.044 --> 08:43.046
We came in about ten minutes
after she woke up.

08:43.921 --> 08:45.839
She did talk...

08:45.921 --> 08:48.422
but she was very confused.

08:48.921 --> 08:52.131
We're not sure what's gonna happen today.

08:52.214 --> 08:55.631
It's either gonna be a new...

08:56.673 --> 08:58.131
plate...

08:58.214 --> 09:01.173
place...
or something completely different.

09:01.257 --> 09:02.965
We're just not sure.

09:05.090 --> 09:07.590
I was really nervous seeing her.

09:07.674 --> 09:09.632
And Jan had kept saying how,

09:09.715 --> 09:14.758
you know, "It's very weird and she's...
she might not recognize you."

09:15.883 --> 09:18.883
For the possibilities...

09:18.966 --> 09:22.426
for life and death.

09:22.467 --> 09:23.967
The fact was, she was alive.

09:24.050 --> 09:26.300
Actually, that was the biggest,
I would say...

09:26.384 --> 09:29.718
"Look, she's alive. And she looks great."

09:31.218 --> 09:32.510
Okay.

09:33.510 --> 09:34.552
Here.

09:38.260 --> 09:40.302
Right, here we are. Hmm?

09:41.094 --> 09:42.761
Okay.

09:42.845 --> 09:45.594
I want you to say some words
beginning with...

09:45.678 --> 09:48.386
Yeah.

09:49.345 --> 09:51.387
You think you can do that?

09:51.429 --> 09:52.470
Um...

09:54.637 --> 09:58.555
So, it could be, um, "sound,"

09:58.638 --> 10:02.596
or "swing," or "sitting."

10:03.596 --> 10:06.888
So, it's starting from... now.

10:09.930 --> 10:12.139
Summer.

10:12.222 --> 10:13.930
- Mmm.
- Or did I already...?

10:14.972 --> 10:16.639
S... Okay.

10:19.181 --> 10:21.473
Seed.

10:26.807 --> 10:29.015
I get...

10:29.099 --> 10:30.349
I get too...

10:40.350 --> 10:43.434
She wasn't able to do the tests
that they do for these situations.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.034
I know you're trying your best...

10:45.058 --> 10:47.934
So it was becoming clear
that there was... more severe issues.

10:48.017 --> 10:49.810
But, I mean, not knowing...

10:49.893 --> 10:54.351
not understanding, really,
what those issues were.

11:11.437 --> 11:14.687
So why don't you just tell me...
what's happened?

11:14.770 --> 11:17.979
I was in a pretty normal,

11:18.062 --> 11:21.521
very busy, normal...

11:23.229 --> 11:25.980
Kind of a clever person.

11:26.063 --> 11:29.439
And now, I'm starting from the beginning.

11:29.980 --> 11:31.938
What does it feel like?

11:33.105 --> 11:36.022
It's extremely strange,

11:36.106 --> 11:38.523
starting from nothing.

11:38.606 --> 11:40.481
It's like tripping out.

11:40.565 --> 11:42.582
I don't really know how to describe it.

11:42.606 --> 11:44.481
How do I say it? I can't...

11:47.649 --> 11:50.441
This normal world...

11:50.482 --> 11:53.357
Normality.

11:53.441 --> 11:54.566
I'm very, sort of...

11:54.649 --> 11:56.733
Bizarre is a way to describe it...

11:56.817 --> 11:58.859
It's difficult to...

11:59.692 --> 12:02.983
Uh, I guess I'm not making much sense.

12:03.066 --> 12:04.275
Sorry.

12:04.358 --> 12:06.443
I wish I could...

12:06.484 --> 12:07.693
Yeah.

12:07.776 --> 12:09.526
I'll try.

12:12.984 --> 12:15.152
What about these photographs?
Do you...

12:15.235 --> 12:16.378
- Pictures?
- Yeah.

12:16.402 --> 12:18.819
Matilda is, um, my...

12:20.277 --> 12:21.485
Is...

12:25.695 --> 12:26.944
My...

12:29.194 --> 12:30.611
She's...

12:34.237 --> 12:36.154
I can't...

12:37.487 --> 12:39.863
My... nephew.

12:39.945 --> 12:42.529
- Yeah, my nephew.
- She's your nephew?

12:42.612 --> 12:43.946
Yes, nephew.

12:44.029 --> 12:47.238
And now, she's also a...

12:48.363 --> 12:51.155
A nephew? Neef... Niece.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.239
I meant, "niece."

12:53.947 --> 12:57.698
For some reason,
I can't say the actual word itself.

12:57.781 --> 12:59.114
This word.

13:00.197 --> 13:02.448
- On that shelf?
- Yeah.

13:02.531 --> 13:05.157
- A record.
- Record, yeah.

13:06.240 --> 13:08.282
Exactly, so...

13:08.365 --> 13:11.657
for some reason, I can say...

13:15.408 --> 13:16.658
You say it again.

13:16.741 --> 13:18.450
- Record.
- Record.

13:19.949 --> 13:21.199
Record.

13:22.576 --> 13:25.950
I can only say it if I don't actually...
If I go like that...

13:26.701 --> 13:30.200
- then I can say the word "record."
- Record.

13:30.284 --> 13:31.451
But not...

13:38.076 --> 13:39.452
You say it again.

13:39.493 --> 13:41.870
- Record.
- Record, yeah.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.453
Record.

13:43.536 --> 13:44.870
I can't...

13:46.453 --> 13:49.369
I can't say it now. But I can't...

13:53.871 --> 13:55.078
Um...

13:56.036 --> 13:59.287
You know, I can't speak or...

13:59.370 --> 14:00.537
No, not speak.

14:00.620 --> 14:01.746
I can't...

14:03.413 --> 14:04.455
be clever.

14:04.538 --> 14:06.180
What do you call it? Um...

14:06.204 --> 14:09.037
- Write?
- Yeah, write.

14:09.121 --> 14:11.706
I can't write at all.

14:11.789 --> 14:14.873
Or be clever or be normal.
Any of that.

14:14.955 --> 14:18.539
It's... it's beyond terrifying.

14:22.123 --> 14:24.582
This could read "tale."
Not "tale."

14:26.790 --> 14:28.766
- What does that say? It's "the"?
- Yeah.

14:28.790 --> 14:29.916
Oh, yeah, "the."

14:29.999 --> 14:31.434
- Does that say "the"?
- Yeah.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.957
I've written "the" before.

14:36.458 --> 14:40.667
I didn't think I would have trouble
with the word "the."

14:41.834 --> 14:45.500
A-B-C-D-E-F-G...

14:51.751 --> 14:52.793
No?

14:53.918 --> 14:57.293
Two?

14:57.418 --> 15:01.461
This isn't in my
correct dictionary, in my brain.

15:01.502 --> 15:03.002
Stew.

15:04.043 --> 15:05.627
Where did that come from?

15:05.711 --> 15:08.169
My date of birth...

15:08.252 --> 15:09.837
and I wrote it wrong.

15:09.920 --> 15:11.837
Happy... Argh!

15:13.211 --> 15:15.795
Okay, something's not right, here, today.

15:15.879 --> 15:18.128
"Help."

15:18.211 --> 15:22.713
That must have been the first wrote
I wrote other than "hi."

15:22.796 --> 15:24.546
The green one is...

15:26.463 --> 15:28.755
on top of the blue one.

15:28.839 --> 15:31.422
- Correct?
- No.

15:34.630 --> 15:39.756
I can't believe I...
can look at, uh, some words...

15:39.840 --> 15:44.756
- Pen. Pen. Pen.
- You know, a book or Internet...

15:45.756 --> 15:51.174
an Internet page,
or someone's written to me an email,

15:51.257 --> 15:55.757
and I don't see what it says.

15:55.841 --> 15:57.884
I know what it says.

15:57.966 --> 16:01.842
But it's all-round
complete gobbledygook.

16:01.925 --> 16:03.717
And I can't believe that.

16:07.217 --> 16:11.176
I refuse to believe that I...
that's happening.

16:14.759 --> 16:19.177
She was an extremely dynamic,
extremely social,

16:19.260 --> 16:21.635
very impassioned individual.

16:22.844 --> 16:26.969
She had a really, really tough job,
had to be very, very organized.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.261
Multitasking, loads of things going on
at the same time.

16:30.344 --> 16:32.428
That was her existence.

16:32.470 --> 16:37.012
Communication, writing films,
writing in general and reading.

16:37.095 --> 16:40.137
You know, Lotje was always reading,
like, these really thick books.

16:42.095 --> 16:44.387
She's the most articulate person.

16:45.179 --> 16:47.763
So, yeah, it's kind of...

16:47.847 --> 16:52.346
...it's almost obscene
that this part, um...

16:53.472 --> 16:55.347
it's affected that part of her brain.

16:55.431 --> 16:57.972
So, today.
It starts today, your holiday.

16:58.055 --> 17:00.764
I think it's probably very alienating.

17:00.848 --> 17:04.138
She can't interact
in the same way with people.

17:04.222 --> 17:06.182
She gets fatigued very easily.

17:06.265 --> 17:09.223
Mathematical function
seems to be impaired.

17:09.307 --> 17:12.015
Which is something that
hasn't actually been addressed, really,

17:12.098 --> 17:14.766
at all, up to this stage,
but I've noticed it.

17:14.849 --> 17:18.933
You know, that kind of logistics,
I don't know the technical terms for it,

17:19.016 --> 17:22.183
but, you know, these, sort of
logical things that we take for granted.

17:24.057 --> 17:26.476
A concern I have at this stage is,

17:26.517 --> 17:29.642
because she's so ambitious
and so energetic,

17:29.726 --> 17:32.058
that she puts too much
pressure on herself.

17:32.142 --> 17:35.059
And that pressure ultimately
leads to a situation

17:35.143 --> 17:39.894
where, you know,
she gets meltdown, basically.

17:43.686 --> 17:47.478
If I'm faced with the question,
"Who am I?"

17:47.561 --> 17:51.561
I'm someone who has a huge
amount of friends,

17:51.644 --> 17:53.562
very hard-working,

17:53.645 --> 17:57.312
travels all over the world,
loves to read.

17:58.562 --> 18:01.896
What if all of that evidence is removed?

18:04.480 --> 18:06.979
What does that make me?

18:13.063 --> 18:18.189
Something's happened to my vision,
which nobody's really explained to me yet.

18:19.481 --> 18:24.482
Pretty normal on the left,
as long as I just keep it on the left.

18:24.565 --> 18:29.148
If I go on the right side,
it's like a whole nother dimension.

18:34.858 --> 18:39.441
Vision to
an internal space, an inner world.

18:43.942 --> 18:47.692
It's a heightened sense of reality.

18:47.775 --> 18:52.776
I don't know, it becomes
a sort of euphoric notion.

18:59.984 --> 19:01.944
Whether it's my brain or reality,

19:02.027 --> 19:08.068
I can experience colors and sounds
like I wasn't able to before.

19:10.360 --> 19:13.904
It sounds like a very loud sound.

19:17.986 --> 19:22.446
So intensified, so exaggerated.

19:26.362 --> 19:29.696
Everything becomes a momentary experience.

19:30.780 --> 19:33.906
Time has a new meaning.

19:33.988 --> 19:38.280
It's all elongated and transient.

19:40.615 --> 19:42.740
You are in this new,

19:42.823 --> 19:46.740
devastating and extremely scary world

19:46.823 --> 19:50.365
that's all yours, by yourself.

19:58.866 --> 20:02.700
To find yourself in this world
where... everything's altered,

20:02.783 --> 20:05.241
it's such a...
such a very strange process,

20:05.325 --> 20:08.910
because as far as we can see,
nothing's changed.

20:08.992 --> 20:11.701
Yet it's all changed for her.

20:20.744 --> 20:25.243
Last time I was in my...
my former home, um,

20:25.327 --> 20:28.369
it was an extremely disturbing experience.

20:30.203 --> 20:32.578
- You okay?
- Yeah.

20:35.203 --> 20:36.244
Oh...

20:37.161 --> 20:38.412
Okay.

20:40.662 --> 20:42.287
I can do it...

20:42.370 --> 20:44.995
It is that one. No, this one.

20:50.330 --> 20:53.497
I don't know if I can do it.
I haven't tried it.

20:53.538 --> 20:55.914
- Must be the other one.
- This one?

20:55.996 --> 20:57.079
Mmm-hmm.

21:02.289 --> 21:03.331
There.

21:10.874 --> 21:12.624
Oh, this is so weird!

21:16.833 --> 21:19.374
That's okay.

21:20.833 --> 21:22.875
It's like a dream.

21:23.583 --> 21:26.626
Somebody did a very good job tidying.

21:27.501 --> 21:33.792
It's like, um, something that I've, um...
changed completely.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.585
If you see what I mean.

21:36.668 --> 21:40.376
Ugh, I feel so pukey.
Do you feel...

21:45.335 --> 21:48.377
I just remember trying to survive
and I don't even know.

21:48.461 --> 21:53.961
I just... I do actually remember
giving up and not caring.

21:54.044 --> 21:55.545
And not...

21:55.629 --> 21:57.921
I just was, like, in a terrible state,

21:58.003 --> 22:00.587
and I didn't know
how I could get out of it.

22:01.837 --> 22:06.546
You're in this weird...
like, weird, parallel-trip thing,

22:06.630 --> 22:09.505
so you can't... you can't say...

22:09.546 --> 22:13.630
You're trying to explain
why you can't make a phone call

22:13.713 --> 22:17.380
or put some clothes on and sort...
get out of here.

22:17.464 --> 22:19.923
You just remember this weird,
bizarre thing

22:20.005 --> 22:22.464
that just got worse and worse
into this nightmare.

22:22.506 --> 22:25.590
And then I remember crying,
which I never cry,

22:25.673 --> 22:29.006
but being really, really upset,

22:29.089 --> 22:34.216
but not being able to figure out why
and how or any of that.

22:34.299 --> 22:38.966
I just got more and more upset,
more sick, more ill,

22:39.049 --> 22:42.633
and more, like, into this nightmare.

22:44.008 --> 22:48.592
I hated the idea that
she'd gone through this all by herself...

22:48.675 --> 22:53.509
...and just lay down in her bed
and, like, was ready to die.

22:53.550 --> 22:56.510
And then something got her up.

22:56.551 --> 22:59.426
And she did it. She got up. And...

23:00.510 --> 23:02.551
you know, that's how...

23:02.635 --> 23:06.219
That's why she gets up every day

23:06.302 --> 23:11.552
and bumps into a wall
and is reminded of what's going on.

23:11.636 --> 23:14.678
But she just... she does it,
and she keeps going.

23:23.137 --> 23:27.804
I haven't lived with my mother
since I was 18.

23:28.638 --> 23:31.721
So, now I'm twent...

23:33.222 --> 23:34.931
Thirty...

23:36.430 --> 23:37.972
four.

23:39.096 --> 23:42.640
So... 34 years old.

23:43.389 --> 23:45.932
Now, we live together.

23:47.848 --> 23:51.891
I mean, I've never thought much
about the brain before, at all.

23:51.974 --> 23:54.766
I mean, this is called
"acquired brain injury,"

23:54.849 --> 23:58.265
but it's an acquired new world
at the same time.

23:59.265 --> 24:01.307
It's very difficult
for anybody to understand,

24:01.390 --> 24:04.558
for her friends and for anybody
around her, because...

24:04.642 --> 24:07.391
She says it herself,
she said the other day, she said,

24:07.475 --> 24:09.850
"I feel like a baby,
but, you know, I'm a grown-up,"

24:09.934 --> 24:12.059
and it's the two things at the same time.

24:12.893 --> 24:16.351
You know, I need to nurture my body
and I need to have a rhythm in the day.

24:16.434 --> 24:20.351
"And, you know, just like a child.
Otherwise, I can't function at all."

24:20.434 --> 24:24.018
On the other hand, you know,
everything's there already. Um...

24:24.101 --> 24:27.810
It's very, very difficult to understand.

24:29.602 --> 24:34.561
I can keep thoughts and ideas
and thought process...

24:34.645 --> 24:38.353
...that are partially finished

24:38.436 --> 24:41.020
and partially need to keep going,

24:41.103 --> 24:42.521
but they disappear.

24:43.145 --> 24:46.187
So, when I can start to be able to write,

24:46.270 --> 24:49.771
I thought, "Instead of having them
disappear into thin air",

24:49.855 --> 24:53.396
which is horrible,
I'll try to write them."

24:55.438 --> 24:56.772
Vi... No.

24:58.104 --> 24:59.271
Va...

24:59.856 --> 25:04.523
The problem is,
of course, is that I can't spell, so...

25:04.564 --> 25:06.981
I don't know if that's the real word.

25:07.898 --> 25:10.565
Isola...

25:10.649 --> 25:12.690
Isolation...

25:14.148 --> 25:19.149
I dream mixed up dreams of the stroke.

25:19.233 --> 25:22.483
The clock strikes.

25:22.525 --> 25:25.358
The stroke of the clock.

25:25.441 --> 25:28.149
And then, creepy mice.

25:29.317 --> 25:35.025
Your dreams have a real new kind of
realness to them,

25:35.108 --> 25:37.984
but before, they were just strange.

25:38.067 --> 25:41.652
And you kind of
get confused between, um...

25:41.735 --> 25:45.026
what's real and what's in your head.

25:48.819 --> 25:50.444
Keep looking at my eye.

25:50.528 --> 25:53.528
I'm going to bring this little target in
from the outside.

25:53.569 --> 25:55.449
Just say "yes" when you see it
coming into view.

25:58.445 --> 25:59.570
Now.

26:03.111 --> 26:04.111
Now.

26:05.779 --> 26:06.779
Now.

26:08.780 --> 26:10.404
Now.

26:10.488 --> 26:13.363
Now. Now. Now.

26:13.446 --> 26:14.446
All right.

26:14.530 --> 26:16.863
You see how much better
the field is on this side

26:16.947 --> 26:18.322
compared to this side.

26:18.405 --> 26:20.565
- When you had your injury...
- Yeah.

26:20.614 --> 26:23.656
...then that affected just one part...

26:23.739 --> 26:26.697
...on the same part of space in each eye.

26:26.782 --> 26:27.907
- Okay.
- Okay?

26:30.865 --> 26:31.907
Okay.

26:33.114 --> 26:36.866
I'm sort of looking around
to who this person's talking to.

26:36.950 --> 26:39.741
I don't know who they're referring...

26:39.824 --> 26:41.074
what, who they're referring to.

26:41.157 --> 26:46.200
And I don't know, um...
how to respond to what they're saying.

26:46.283 --> 26:48.242
It'll take half an hour to work.

27:02.618 --> 27:05.869
I wanted to ask you
why you wanted to film this.

27:05.953 --> 27:08.244
Why did you get in touch with me?

27:08.327 --> 27:12.869
A lot of people in your situation would
just be thinking about their recovery.

27:12.953 --> 27:15.620
I'm rec... I'm obsessed
with recording everything

27:15.703 --> 27:19.578
and I'm unable to remember anything.

27:19.662 --> 27:20.745
So, it's like...

27:20.828 --> 27:25.162
I think it's part of the brain
has become unable to...

27:25.246 --> 27:26.287
um...

27:27.371 --> 27:28.496
remember things.

27:28.538 --> 27:30.454
You've become obsessed
with recording it...

27:30.538 --> 27:32.204
- Mmm.
- ...'cause you're just terrified

27:32.287 --> 27:34.120
- that it's gonna get lost.
- Mmm.

27:35.372 --> 27:39.789
In order to, uh, make sense of it,
I want to record it.

27:43.080 --> 27:48.206
There is a hilariously, kind of,
surreal reality to it.

27:48.289 --> 27:50.248
It's surreal-it's surreal.

27:50.331 --> 27:54.457
And um, I don't know
if it's your neurological...

27:55.040 --> 27:56.040
I don't know.

27:56.123 --> 27:57.582
It's not me, it's...

27:57.666 --> 28:00.541
That's what happened.
That's what it feels like.

28:00.624 --> 28:02.082
It's like, um...

28:03.123 --> 28:06.333
You know, you think about, um...

28:07.792 --> 28:10.750
You know,
you think about David Lynch and...

28:10.833 --> 28:12.226
...things like that a lot.

28:17.960 --> 28:21.709
It's like being in the Red Room
in Twin Peaks.

28:22.543 --> 28:25.835
I've been having imaginary conversations
with him in my head.

28:34.878 --> 28:38.545
My name's Lotje Sodderland,

28:38.586 --> 28:42.336
and I live in Hackney, in London.

28:42.420 --> 28:46.420
Two months ago,
I had an intracerebral...

28:46.504 --> 28:48.587
...hemorrhage

28:48.671 --> 28:53.713
and lost the use of my
reading and writing,

28:53.797 --> 28:57.255
which is why I'm sending you
a video message.

28:58.213 --> 29:01.380
It's like a dimen... a new dimension.

29:01.463 --> 29:04.256
It's an exquisite, painful...

29:04.339 --> 29:08.881
sometimes, like a nightmare place

29:08.965 --> 29:10.631
inside my head.

29:10.714 --> 29:14.257
But it's also somewhere where I can...

29:15.382 --> 29:21.633
get completely lost inside this beautiful

29:21.716 --> 29:28.091
and extraor... extraordinary new place
that I've myself discovered,

29:28.174 --> 29:31.425
where my brain once was.

29:31.509 --> 29:35.634
So I'd love to share it with you,
'cause I think you're gonna like it.

29:46.343 --> 29:50.134
I'm going on a fun trip.
With my bag.

29:50.219 --> 29:54.011
I only found out three days ago
that I was gonna go there.

29:54.094 --> 29:59.553
This might be very, very difficult
for me to actually do properly.

29:59.594 --> 30:03.220
I can't process the, um...
...the concept,

30:03.303 --> 30:07.178
the reality of going to live
as an inpatient

30:07.262 --> 30:10.846
in a neurological... place.

30:11.930 --> 30:13.221
Hospital.

30:13.304 --> 30:15.972
Full of ill people like me.

30:17.596 --> 30:21.597
Just to imagine that I'm with a friend,

30:21.681 --> 30:24.389
going somewhere fun,
like it would be before.

30:24.472 --> 30:27.055
And maybe it will be after.

30:27.138 --> 30:31.306
And that there's gonna be some
very serious moments...

30:31.390 --> 30:32.890
...inside it.

30:32.974 --> 30:35.223
But there's no point
in me trying to imagine them,

30:35.306 --> 30:39.016
because my brain doesn't have
the capacity to compute.

30:39.099 --> 30:41.808
So, to compute something...

30:41.891 --> 30:44.474
to anything like that is stupid,

30:44.558 --> 30:49.141
is pointless, is stressful
and counterproductive.

30:50.433 --> 30:52.058
Okay.

30:59.810 --> 31:02.518
So, are you ready
for the final countdown?

31:03.518 --> 31:08.269
I'm ready, but the question
more importantly is, are you ready?

31:08.352 --> 31:13.852
Well, I've got no sense of space and time,
so it's fine for me.

31:15.978 --> 31:17.687
We have a very close relationship.

31:18.186 --> 31:22.103
We've had a very tumultuous life
and we've shared quite a lot of that,

31:22.186 --> 31:24.436
so I think that's why we're quite close.

31:25.478 --> 31:27.604
Our parents weren't together.

31:27.688 --> 31:29.479
So I was brought up by my mum.

31:30.271 --> 31:34.062
And our childhood was
an unconventional adventure.

31:35.437 --> 31:38.230
But I always knew I could
depend on Jan for anything.

31:39.814 --> 31:42.230
I wonder if I'll be allowed outside.

31:42.313 --> 31:44.022
What do you think?

31:44.105 --> 31:47.064
I think they don't tend to, uh, put...

31:47.147 --> 31:50.064
let people outside from the secure unit.

31:51.273 --> 31:54.439
He has a great sense of humor.

31:54.523 --> 31:57.566
That makes an enormous difference.
And he'll always be like that.

31:57.607 --> 31:59.440
He's been like that since the beginning.

31:59.524 --> 32:02.983
Even in the hospital, he'll be funny
and he'll make me laugh.

32:03.065 --> 32:05.942
Even if I can't even laugh myself.

32:06.025 --> 32:08.984
If I still smoked cigarettes,
I'd be allowed out.

32:09.066 --> 32:10.525
I don't know if they would.

32:10.567 --> 32:15.400
I think you might be tied down
until you'd given up smoking.

32:15.483 --> 32:19.651
- How do you get out, though, and in?
- I'll show you.

32:22.276 --> 32:24.693
About to be admitted.

32:24.776 --> 32:29.527
You're going to say goodbye to the world,
especially me, 'cause I'm not coming out.

32:29.569 --> 32:33.318
Maybe I'll be an impre...
improved specimen.

33:26.783 --> 33:28.324
I'm really...

33:35.075 --> 33:36.909
Hey, Sophie.

33:37.867 --> 33:39.576
Quick hello from the loo.

33:41.701 --> 33:44.577
Trying to go back to being in hospital...

33:46.035 --> 33:49.285
after being away for almost two months.

33:50.451 --> 33:51.868
Um...

33:51.952 --> 33:57.411
Trying to get around the psychology
of being a patient...

33:57.494 --> 33:59.202
and being reduced...

34:01.119 --> 34:06.912
to be equal with everybody else
who's in there with me.

34:08.661 --> 34:10.661
I'm feeling very fortunate.

34:12.121 --> 34:17.329
Um, I'll send you a picture of dinner,
which was at 5:30 p.m.

34:18.413 --> 34:21.246
I'm going to bed in just under an hour.

34:22.289 --> 34:23.831
Have a great evening.

34:38.498 --> 34:40.373
1:00 a.m.

34:45.206 --> 34:47.708
Night-time sounds at the hospital...

34:48.623 --> 34:52.583
remind me of when I first woke up.

34:54.583 --> 34:58.542
And it felt like nobody could hear me
and I was invisible.

34:59.542 --> 35:01.376
How terrifying that is.

35:06.585 --> 35:09.209
Not sure that this is a good idea,
but the...

35:10.794 --> 35:15.252
but the silence in the head
doesn't exist here.

35:27.253 --> 35:28.753
Time to get up.

35:40.672 --> 35:43.589
It can happen to you,
it could happen to me.

35:43.630 --> 35:47.922
It seems to be fairly indiscriminate

35:48.006 --> 35:52.048
and that's quite a reality to behold,
I think.

35:52.131 --> 35:56.798
Point to your forearm,
then your shoulders.

35:58.214 --> 36:00.716
- Forearm, then my shoulders?
- Mmm-hmm.

36:06.173 --> 36:07.382
Mmm...

36:08.300 --> 36:09.675
shoulders...

36:15.383 --> 36:16.592
Close.

36:18.259 --> 36:19.801
- Shoulders.
- Mmm-hmm.

36:19.884 --> 36:21.968
It's hugely confrontational,

36:22.051 --> 36:27.719
because unless you challenge
what someone can't do...

36:29.011 --> 36:30.927
you won't improve it.

36:31.011 --> 36:35.552
This is where I learn
about the outer reaches...

36:37.469 --> 36:41.511
of human vulnerability...

36:45.094 --> 36:46.553
and strength...

36:48.095 --> 36:52.596
and what a person,
what a human is made from.

36:54.137 --> 36:57.221
What it's made from inside.

36:59.014 --> 37:05.513
Lotje has aphasia,
which is an impairment of language.

37:06.639 --> 37:09.015
She has this difficulty sequencing,

37:09.097 --> 37:12.681
sifting information,
knowing what's the most important thing.

37:12.764 --> 37:13.848
Where were you?

37:14.389 --> 37:16.807
I was, um...

37:18.265 --> 37:20.140
in intensive care.

37:21.181 --> 37:26.099
- And it seemed like... night-time.
- Mmm-hmm.

37:29.433 --> 37:30.600
And...

37:33.975 --> 37:36.392
my brother was there and my mum.

37:37.892 --> 37:42.225
I didn't understand
why I wasn't able to talk to them.

37:44.059 --> 37:47.351
And I guess that's just the beginning...
that's the beginning.

37:56.061 --> 37:59.061
I haven't slept very well.

38:03.978 --> 38:06.520
They, uh...

38:06.604 --> 38:07.979
This is gonna take forever.

38:08.062 --> 38:09.812
No, it's okay that it does.

38:10.812 --> 38:12.437
It takes as long as it takes.

38:21.896 --> 38:24.939
Getting really difficult to be...

38:25.023 --> 38:27.064
other people's properly...

38:27.147 --> 38:29.772
Property.

38:29.856 --> 38:34.648
People taking over my plans, my life.

38:34.732 --> 38:38.565
Doctors telling me...

38:38.607 --> 38:40.857
...things that I don't understand.

38:43.524 --> 38:46.107
But still being
at that stage in life where...

38:47.649 --> 38:53.108
obviously, I should be able to take
control of myself, and responsibility.

38:54.817 --> 38:58.609
But people are hijacking... my whole life.

38:58.650 --> 39:00.984
Hijacked, I guess.

39:15.902 --> 39:20.736
Touch-typing using shortcuts
are coming back to me like magic,

39:20.819 --> 39:23.320
so I know I can rely on those.

39:23.403 --> 39:27.570
You do it automatically.
It's automatic... now, you know?

39:27.612 --> 39:32.071
For a long time, it was, like, one...
one at a time.

39:34.237 --> 39:36.404
"I look back..."

39:39.195 --> 39:42.238
at my words...

39:43.572 --> 39:49.155
"they will have disappeared."

39:50.031 --> 39:51.990
Maybe,
"Especially because I can still write."

39:52.073 --> 39:52.990
Yeah.

39:53.073 --> 39:58.615
Because that's that thing that is quite...
the most unintuitive part of all of this.

39:58.656 --> 40:01.949
We think of reading and writing as being
almost the same thing.

40:02.033 --> 40:03.949
You write something, then you read it.

40:04.033 --> 40:07.115
But for the brain, it doesn't work
like that at all, you know?

40:07.198 --> 40:10.783
It's a very different process
that is not at all obvious.

40:10.867 --> 40:13.283
Is that 'cause it's a different
part of the brain?

40:13.366 --> 40:16.867
It's because
the pathways are a little different.

40:16.950 --> 40:19.867
To write something,
you don't need to necessarily see it.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.701
But to read it,
it's the visual part of the brain

40:22.784 --> 40:24.409
that now is having the trouble.

40:24.492 --> 40:26.451
So your brain can see the words,

40:26.534 --> 40:28.594
but the connection
between the seeing part of the brain

40:28.618 --> 40:31.160
and the language part of the brain
has been disrupted.

40:32.535 --> 40:35.243
But the path which goes
from the language part of the brain

40:35.327 --> 40:38.201
to the motor part of the brain
to write it is fine.

40:38.285 --> 40:41.786
So you can write it and then
when you read it, there's a blockage.

40:41.870 --> 40:43.244
Yeah.

40:43.328 --> 40:44.953
Okay.

40:45.494 --> 40:48.202
Update to self, note to self,

40:48.286 --> 40:52.370
this is not a step backwards,
this is an enormous step forwards.

40:55.495 --> 40:57.203
This is progress.

40:59.580 --> 41:03.288
Massive progress.
The other one was just an illusion.

41:04.788 --> 41:06.913
A comfortable illusion.

41:06.997 --> 41:10.497
This is an uncomfortable reality.

41:18.582 --> 41:20.415
Cuckoo...

41:20.498 --> 41:23.041
Cuckoo...

41:25.082 --> 41:28.541
It's all going nuts here at the nuthouse.

41:28.625 --> 41:31.875
The psychology of recovery.

41:33.708 --> 41:35.207
Escape?

41:37.083 --> 41:39.667
And run away?

41:40.792 --> 41:41.834
Kidding.

41:42.834 --> 41:45.959
One of the nice ladies said I was allowed.

41:46.043 --> 41:48.044
So long as I don't get lost.

41:48.126 --> 41:50.501
My weekly timetable.

41:50.585 --> 41:54.251
Occupational therapist,
language therapist,

41:54.335 --> 41:56.878
a psychologist and a psychiatrist.

41:56.961 --> 41:59.753
And I'm not sure which is which.

41:59.836 --> 42:01.878
You know, this video communication

42:01.961 --> 42:04.961
is really amazing for people
who were away.

42:05.045 --> 42:06.502
Here I am...

42:09.087 --> 42:10.378
in...

42:11.795 --> 42:13.795
the brain room.

42:13.879 --> 42:15.587
Exactly what Lotje
was doing before,

42:15.629 --> 42:18.379
she communicates with everyone via video.

42:18.463 --> 42:21.630
And she just makes me laugh.

42:21.713 --> 42:25.546
This is where I perform
me leisure activities.

42:25.630 --> 42:30.631
And this is where I like to play snooker
or write some music.

42:32.297 --> 42:35.882
You have to come here sometime.
It's a real hoot.

42:36.673 --> 42:41.090
Really want to know what that... says.

42:46.966 --> 42:49.633
- Hey, Adam.
- Hello.

42:50.966 --> 42:52.841
How are you doing?

42:52.924 --> 42:54.424
Wonderful.

42:54.507 --> 42:55.800
What are you making?

42:57.133 --> 42:59.342
I'm not making,
I'm creating.

42:59.425 --> 43:00.634
What are you creating?

43:00.717 --> 43:03.675
A robot for my son.

43:04.592 --> 43:07.301
You're my only friend here, Adam.

43:07.384 --> 43:08.926
I'm your only friend?

43:09.010 --> 43:11.635
Here at the RNRU, yeah.

43:11.676 --> 43:14.761
Well, you've got a good friend,
that's all I can say.

43:16.260 --> 43:17.969
You're not wrong there, Adam.

43:19.844 --> 43:21.677
Very good friend.

43:21.761 --> 43:26.012
Are you looking forward to going home,
going into the real world?

43:27.470 --> 43:30.637
I'm... I'm looking forward to it, yes,

43:30.720 --> 43:34.137
but I'll deal with it when I get there,

43:34.220 --> 43:38.429
because I've been out here
for a long time.

43:38.512 --> 43:40.471
You think it's gonna be all right?

43:40.554 --> 43:43.889
Yeah.
Life is what you make it.

43:44.889 --> 43:46.930
Life is what you make it.

43:53.431 --> 43:56.931
- Martin. Magical Martin.
- Mmm.

43:57.015 --> 43:59.348
- I'm going to read.
- Okay.

43:59.431 --> 44:02.640
See, um...
See if I can do it without messing it up.

44:02.681 --> 44:04.807
- Okay. We're a team.
- Yeah?

44:04.891 --> 44:09.515
In this case, the writings
of the incredible Mr. Lynch,

44:09.599 --> 44:12.767
that I'm dying to get my head around.

44:13.433 --> 44:17.725
"Within every..." No.

44:18.642 --> 44:20.350
"Within..."

44:20.433 --> 44:25.517
"Within your own self
is a treasury, an ocean of pure bliss",

44:25.601 --> 44:29.184
consciousness, intelligence, creativity,

44:29.267 --> 44:33.226
love, happiness, energy, and peace,

44:33.310 --> 44:35.352
"within every human being."

44:35.435 --> 44:39.894
"...of pure bliss."

44:39.977 --> 44:40.977
Yeah.

44:41.061 --> 44:45.811
"Experience that
and you will begin to know yourself",

44:45.895 --> 44:50.020
which is unbounded, eternal totality."

44:51.062 --> 44:55.104
"...to-ta-lity."

44:55.187 --> 44:57.604
Excellent. Well done.

44:57.646 --> 44:59.854
Yeah.

45:01.064 --> 45:02.372
I think that's wonderful.

45:02.396 --> 45:06.855
It means we have it all in us,
don't need to search too far.

45:06.938 --> 45:08.022
Yeah.

45:08.105 --> 45:11.981
- Just, uh, have a look inside...
- Mmm-hmm.

45:12.065 --> 45:14.356
...and hopefully
we'll find what we're looking for.

45:14.439 --> 45:18.023
- That's it, yeah. Mmm.
- I think that's great.

45:19.023 --> 45:21.024
It feels like a door has opened.

45:21.690 --> 45:23.231
A brand new door.

45:23.315 --> 45:26.940
It's in the middle, but it's open.

45:28.273 --> 45:29.857
It wants to let me in.

45:32.775 --> 45:36.858
Note to tell Sophie, or someone.

45:45.317 --> 45:46.651
This is your towel.

45:48.150 --> 45:49.652
That's it?

45:49.735 --> 45:52.069
This is your towel, too.

45:52.151 --> 45:53.860
I should've brought a bag, really.

45:53.943 --> 45:55.735
It's all right, we can...
I can carry it.

45:55.818 --> 45:57.485
What are you thinking about now?

45:59.402 --> 46:02.235
Can I just show you how
these organizational skills

46:02.319 --> 46:03.903
have massively improved?

46:03.986 --> 46:06.070
I think you're very distracted right now.

46:06.152 --> 46:08.987
You're not thinking about
the task in hand at all.

46:09.071 --> 46:11.570
- What, me?
- Yeah.

46:11.654 --> 46:13.362
See, if you had a brain hemorrhage,

46:13.445 --> 46:16.528
you'd focus on the things
that you should be focusing on,

46:16.612 --> 46:18.613
and ignore everything else.

46:18.655 --> 46:21.404
Pretty handy, in fact.

46:21.488 --> 46:24.571
I'll remember that.
I'll be sure to have one soon.

46:24.655 --> 46:26.072
Mmm-hmm.

46:26.154 --> 46:30.947
It's been a very, very, very, very, very,
very, very hard process to be here.

46:33.947 --> 46:37.823
I am different than I was,
maybe I'm never gonna be the same.

46:37.907 --> 46:40.365
That's only, really,
just occurred to me.

46:42.115 --> 46:45.074
But I'm still hoping that it's not true.

46:46.531 --> 46:48.991
Where I'm gonna end up,
or how I'll end up,

46:49.075 --> 46:54.324
when it comes to romance,
my life, work, you know,

46:54.407 --> 46:57.283
those are the things
that you start freaking out about.

47:09.326 --> 47:11.618
Is that one for Auntie Lotje?

47:11.660 --> 47:12.743
Yeah.

47:13.409 --> 47:15.159
Well, thank you.

47:15.242 --> 47:16.368
Is that a leaf?

47:16.451 --> 47:18.202
Yeah.

47:19.869 --> 47:22.327
This is a book
for people who can't read.

47:24.869 --> 47:26.536
It's got all pictures in it, you see?

47:26.620 --> 47:29.703
- I can't read.
- Neither can I.

47:29.787 --> 47:31.578
I can't read.

47:32.578 --> 47:33.912
I can't read.

47:35.161 --> 47:37.287
I can't read and I can read it.

47:39.329 --> 47:41.412
Dear Mr. Lynch,

47:41.496 --> 47:45.080
I'm writing to you
from Victoria Park in London.

47:45.162 --> 47:50.372
I'm worried that I've used up
the limit of my intelligence

47:50.455 --> 47:53.747
and it won't develop
any further from here.

47:53.830 --> 47:59.206
That would make problems
in the trajectory of my future.

47:59.289 --> 48:03.665
Certainly if I can't do writing
or reading...

48:03.748 --> 48:04.873
I've had it.

48:06.582 --> 48:08.290
Only time will tell.

48:11.540 --> 48:12.999
Very curious.

48:19.125 --> 48:22.416
What do we have here?
Headline,

48:22.500 --> 48:27.542
a very long and very
interesting-looking article

48:27.626 --> 48:30.751
about reprogramming our brains...

48:31.334 --> 48:33.834
using crans...

48:33.918 --> 48:38.460
No, transcranial stimulation,

48:38.543 --> 48:40.418
which sounds very scary,

48:40.502 --> 48:44.336
but that is exactly
what I have just signed up for.

48:44.419 --> 48:50.087
And when I've done this fabled therapy,
I'll be able to read.

48:50.169 --> 48:51.419
Maybe.

49:06.380 --> 49:07.463
Like that?

49:08.421 --> 49:10.421
Yes, please, that's great.

49:19.297 --> 49:20.690
It's basically a battery.

49:20.714 --> 49:22.900
When it first switches on,
you can feel a bit of tingling,

49:22.924 --> 49:27.007
so you get two pads over the head,
and the current goes between the two pads.

49:27.091 --> 49:29.067
A lot of the current actually
doesn't go through the brain.

49:29.091 --> 49:30.358
A lot of it just goes through the skin.

49:30.382 --> 49:34.341
But a small amount goes through the brain
and we think that's the therapeutic bit.

49:34.424 --> 49:37.341
So, for some, it works, and for some,
it doesn't work so well,

49:37.424 --> 49:38.716
but on a group level, it works.

49:38.800 --> 49:41.174
So we know that works,
we're trying to enhance that.

49:41.257 --> 49:42.384
Okay.

49:42.467 --> 49:45.051
Yeah, I'm definitely willing to do that.

49:45.134 --> 49:46.967
- Okay, great.
- Yeah.

49:48.467 --> 49:52.593
I'm super excited to see
what the results will be,

49:52.677 --> 49:54.677
but I'm also fully aware of the fact

49:54.760 --> 49:59.510
that this is an experiment
that, uh, may or may not work.

49:59.593 --> 50:05.177
I'd love to wake up with a massively
improved cognitive ability, of course,

50:05.260 --> 50:07.511
especially around my reading.

50:08.594 --> 50:09.594
Um...

50:10.511 --> 50:11.679
But...

50:13.345 --> 50:18.428
Um, you know, if it doesn't work,
then I've given my body to science.

50:20.096 --> 50:22.055
Get this all set up and ready.

50:26.262 --> 50:28.471
- How's it feel?
- All right.

50:28.554 --> 50:30.639
- Tingling away?
- Tingling away.

50:30.681 --> 50:32.722
All right, well,
let's start the training.

50:32.806 --> 50:34.389
- You ready?
- Yeah.

50:34.472 --> 50:35.555
Okay, off you go.

50:37.681 --> 50:39.555
- Rain.
- Rain.

50:39.639 --> 50:41.640
- Yes.
- Yes.

50:41.682 --> 50:43.515
- Space.
- Space.

50:43.598 --> 50:45.348
- Assist.
- Assist.

50:45.431 --> 50:49.515
I have to spend a month
doing very intensive therapy.

50:49.598 --> 50:51.516
- Purple.
- Purple.

50:51.599 --> 50:53.599
- Past.
- Past.

50:53.683 --> 50:58.016
The effect is to rewire my brain,

50:58.100 --> 51:00.101
so that it's able to find

51:00.183 --> 51:04.225
new routes to where
it used to go automatically.

51:04.308 --> 51:06.101
- Panic.
- Panic.

51:06.183 --> 51:08.017
- Down.
- Down.

51:08.101 --> 51:09.726
- Past.
- Past.

51:09.810 --> 51:10.976
Yes.

51:12.351 --> 51:15.893
I have to be exposed to words

51:15.976 --> 51:19.769
through sound and vision simultaneously,

51:19.852 --> 51:23.894
so that, as I hear the words
and I see them,

51:23.977 --> 51:30.645
I start to reconnect the sound of
those words with the sight of those words.

51:31.812 --> 51:33.687
- Roar.
- Roar.

51:33.770 --> 51:35.520
- Rescue.
- Rescue.

51:35.603 --> 51:37.062
- Boy.
- Boy.

51:37.978 --> 51:39.688
- Wish.
- Wish.

51:39.771 --> 51:40.979
Pie.

51:42.105 --> 51:46.688
Kind of a crazy sensation.
It feels like stinging nettles.

51:47.479 --> 51:49.438
Hard work,

51:49.522 --> 51:53.814
and they've given me this really
dodgy laptop to take home,

51:53.897 --> 51:57.648
to carry on when I get home,
for an hour every day.

52:02.272 --> 52:04.564
- Birds.
- Birds.

52:04.648 --> 52:06.606
- Tough.
- Tough.

52:06.690 --> 52:08.482
- Soon.
- Soon.

52:08.565 --> 52:10.440
- Quick.
- When...

52:10.524 --> 52:12.816
- Tad.
- Tad.

52:12.899 --> 52:14.816
- Skill.
- Skill.

52:14.899 --> 52:17.358
- Hope.
- Hope.

52:17.441 --> 52:19.233
- Dance.
- Dance.

52:19.316 --> 52:24.692
I'm starting to actually
read the word along its length.

52:24.733 --> 52:28.859
Read each letter in the word

52:28.943 --> 52:31.984
and understand the series,

52:32.068 --> 52:36.443
the sequence of letters in a joint whole.

52:36.527 --> 52:38.485
- Loan.
- Loan.

52:38.568 --> 52:40.860
- Owl.
- Owl.

52:40.944 --> 52:43.235
- Need.
- Need.

52:43.318 --> 52:45.694
The cognition is
certainly improving.

52:45.777 --> 52:47.070
- Abuse.
- Abuse.

52:47.153 --> 52:49.528
But what do I know?

52:49.611 --> 52:53.194
I'm just an innocent guinea pig.

52:56.529 --> 53:02.612
So, um, did you have any ill effects
after the, uh, stimulation yesterday?

53:02.696 --> 53:05.697
No headaches,
nothing else like that in the evening?

53:05.780 --> 53:07.822
- No.
- Good.

53:07.905 --> 53:11.238
Words, words, words.
So many words.

53:11.321 --> 53:12.947
Words, words, words.

53:13.030 --> 53:14.822
Just three days left.

53:17.656 --> 53:19.406
Whoo-hoo!

53:19.489 --> 53:21.447
- Stroke.
- Stroke.

53:21.531 --> 53:23.447
- See.
- See.

53:23.531 --> 53:24.907
- Dog.
- Dog.

53:24.990 --> 53:26.990
Wood.

53:28.281 --> 53:30.448
Lid.

53:30.532 --> 53:31.615
Open.

53:31.699 --> 53:32.907
Open.

53:34.908 --> 53:37.700
Legal.

53:37.783 --> 53:39.449
I thought I just saw a flash.

53:40.700 --> 53:42.199
May have been...

53:42.282 --> 53:43.700
Are you okay?
How are you feeling?

53:43.783 --> 53:45.659
- Legal.
- No.

53:47.701 --> 53:48.867
Happen.

53:50.867 --> 53:52.307
- Given.
- First mistake.

53:52.367 --> 53:53.409
Given.

53:53.492 --> 53:54.702
- Girl.
- Girl.

53:54.743 --> 53:56.535
Oh!

53:57.535 --> 53:58.636
Mum.

53:58.660 --> 54:00.493
That's deeply unpleasant.

54:00.576 --> 54:02.827
It didn't do that before.
This is new.

54:02.910 --> 54:05.202
- Strike.
- Strike.

54:05.285 --> 54:06.285
- Winner.
- Winner.

54:06.369 --> 54:08.054
Run through that block
and I'll get Jenny down.

54:08.078 --> 54:09.161
- Love.
- Love.

54:09.244 --> 54:10.869
- Log.
- Log.

54:10.953 --> 54:12.953
- Sock.
- Sock.

54:13.036 --> 54:15.037
- Story.
- Story.

54:15.787 --> 54:16.995
Next one?

54:17.079 --> 54:18.245
Uh, just hold it there.

54:18.328 --> 54:19.829
- You sure?
- Yeah.

54:59.708 --> 55:01.374
It was probably about 4:00 p.m.

55:01.959 --> 55:05.417
Lotje had called and there was a problem,

55:05.500 --> 55:08.042
and I needed to go over there
very quickly.

55:10.167 --> 55:14.292
She was squatting outside,
her speech was very impaired,

55:14.376 --> 55:16.459
and she didn't really know
what was going on.

55:16.543 --> 55:18.209
There was a lot of confusion.

55:20.710 --> 55:24.128
The ambulance came,
I explained to them Lotje's history.

55:24.210 --> 55:28.169
They asked me questions,
they tried to ask Lotje questions,

55:28.252 --> 55:31.129
some of which she could answer,

55:31.211 --> 55:35.878
some of which she half-answered,
most of which she didn't answer at all.

55:39.586 --> 55:43.212
Lotje was half off the stretcher,

55:43.295 --> 55:47.713
her eyes turned up, you could only see the
whites of her eyes, her face was purple.

55:47.796 --> 55:49.337
And she was...

55:51.131 --> 55:53.505
You know,
I didn't know what was going on.

56:01.423 --> 56:05.631
She started convulsing. You know,
these were very violent body movements.

56:11.549 --> 56:14.340
One of the nurses was trying to,
sort of, keep her on the stretcher.

56:15.215 --> 56:17.382
The movements got so powerful

56:17.465 --> 56:20.842
that he asked me to help him
to keep Lotje where she was.

56:22.134 --> 56:24.341
Overall,
it lasted over a four-hour period.

56:29.426 --> 56:32.467
At that stage, obviously,
you start, um...

56:32.551 --> 56:36.135
I guess you start blaming
or you start looking for reasons.

56:54.386 --> 56:57.053
My whole body is, um, is in shock.

56:58.595 --> 57:04.387
The whole of my back,
my arms, my legs, my-my...

57:05.554 --> 57:08.805
My, um...

57:08.888 --> 57:10.304
This.

57:11.596 --> 57:12.847
What do you call that?

57:12.930 --> 57:14.388
- Hips?
- Yes.

57:15.513 --> 57:17.472
Truth.

57:18.723 --> 57:21.347
Talk me through
what you can remember.

57:21.431 --> 57:26.931
On Monday, I went back
to Queen Square for the penultimate time.

57:28.223 --> 57:31.557
After my zapping, I went home

57:31.640 --> 57:35.682
and started my one hour
of words repetition.

57:35.724 --> 57:38.183
- Bird.
- Bird.

57:38.266 --> 57:43.891
I started seeing these flashes of color
appearing in front of me.

57:43.975 --> 57:47.934
Lots of color, repetitive flashes,
growing bigger and bigger, like...

57:50.475 --> 57:55.726
A hallucinogenic,
uncontrollable growth of color.

57:57.185 --> 57:59.518
I started panicking. Um...

58:00.560 --> 58:03.727
When I thought,
"Okay, I have to, uh...

58:03.810 --> 58:08.477
I don't know what's happening,
but it feels a little bit like a stroke."

58:09.602 --> 58:13.728
It's frightening losing yourself...

58:14.728 --> 58:16.228
being lost in your body.

58:17.062 --> 58:21.895
I wasn't, obviously,
expecting an epileptic fit.

58:24.228 --> 58:27.063
"Epileptic seizures result from
abnormal, excessive,"

58:27.147 --> 58:31.771
or hypersynchronous
neuronal activity in the brain.

58:31.855 --> 58:35.439
About 50 million people worldwide
have epilepsy,

58:35.522 --> 58:40.564
"and nearly 90% of epilepsy occurs
in the developing countries."

58:40.647 --> 58:41.772
Okay.

58:42.772 --> 58:45.107
- Just... just...
- I don't have epilepsy.

58:46.690 --> 58:47.940
Do I?

58:52.565 --> 58:54.774
My vision is distorted...

58:55.399 --> 59:01.774
but this time, it isn't interesting
like it was in Nov... November.

59:01.858 --> 59:03.232
It's scary.

59:06.525 --> 59:11.483
Okay, now I'm seeing things
on my right hand side.

59:11.567 --> 59:14.443
Things that shouldn't be there.

59:14.526 --> 59:15.943
I see this...

59:17.484 --> 59:20.234
phantom... object.

59:21.068 --> 59:26.027
Colors are getting brighter
and the patterns keep repeating.

59:26.111 --> 59:31.194
Orange. No. Yeah. No, purple.

59:31.277 --> 59:34.611
And green.
And they keep growing.

59:35.278 --> 59:38.987
"Diplopia, double vision,
amnesia, balance disorder",

59:39.070 --> 59:40.528
disturbance in attention,

59:40.611 --> 59:43.071
"loss of concentration,
memory impairment."

59:43.155 --> 59:47.320
The land looks unfamiliar.

59:48.988 --> 59:51.071
I feel like a stranger here.

59:52.739 --> 59:57.488
Tomorrow, I'll talk to Elsmore
and see what he thinks.

59:57.572 --> 01:00:01.197
I hope it's not gonna be like this
for the rest of my life.

01:00:02.948 --> 01:00:05.906
I'm terrified of having...

01:00:06.948 --> 01:00:08.531
...another epi.

01:00:08.614 --> 01:00:12.158
"Agitation, depression,
emotional instability",

01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:15.615
mood swings,
hostility or aggression, insomnia,

01:00:15.699 --> 01:00:19.782
"nervousness, irritability,
personal disorders, behavioral problems."

01:00:19.866 --> 01:00:22.533
Great medication!

01:00:22.616 --> 01:00:25.366
Perfect for your condition,
I would say.

01:00:25.450 --> 01:00:27.408
Isn't it?

01:00:42.202 --> 01:00:44.261
You were telling me
that you'd had a seizure.

01:00:44.285 --> 01:00:45.827
So, tell me what happened there.

01:00:45.910 --> 01:00:51.995
Well, I've been doing this, um,
electromagnetic therapy thing.

01:00:52.078 --> 01:00:56.619
- Uh, I forget what it...
- See... I've regressed.

01:00:56.703 --> 01:00:59.286
- I have regressed since the seizure.
- Yeah.

01:00:59.369 --> 01:01:03.328
Um, but... Um, but yeah, it's, um...

01:01:03.412 --> 01:01:05.620
Yeah, some sort of...

01:01:07.370 --> 01:01:10.455
- Um, transmagnetic...
- Yes, I know what you mean.

01:01:10.538 --> 01:01:13.122
I don't have much experience
of the technique.

01:01:13.205 --> 01:01:14.747
It would not surprise me at all

01:01:14.788 --> 01:01:18.496
if it were a potential side effect
to the treatment,

01:01:18.580 --> 01:01:20.539
but I don't know for definite.

01:01:20.622 --> 01:01:23.497
Brain injury puts you at risk of seizures,

01:01:23.581 --> 01:01:28.748
so you were at risk of having a seizure
with or without the treatment,

01:01:28.789 --> 01:01:32.707
so, difficult to say, for me,
whether it was directly related.

01:01:32.749 --> 01:01:35.207
Did anyone start you
on any treatment for that?

01:01:35.290 --> 01:01:37.415
- Yeah, I have to take it every day.
- Yes.

01:01:37.498 --> 01:01:39.666
And it's for people
who have epileptic fits.

01:01:39.750 --> 01:01:40.791
Yeah.

01:01:40.875 --> 01:01:43.291
So, I don't know if that...
you know, if that includes me,

01:01:43.374 --> 01:01:47.083
because it might just have been a one-off.

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:48.917
I hope it was a one-off.

01:01:49.001 --> 01:01:50.584
It's a bit difficult to tell,

01:01:50.667 --> 01:01:53.827
but probably the sensible thing for you
at the moment is to be on the treatment.

01:01:53.876 --> 01:01:54.876
Yeah.

01:01:54.959 --> 01:01:58.126
And that's... the most likely situation
where this won't happen again,

01:01:58.209 --> 01:02:00.543
which is, I'm sure,
what you would like at the moment.

01:02:00.626 --> 01:02:04.752
The medication
can make people a little bit drowsy

01:02:04.793 --> 01:02:07.543
and feel not quite themselves.

01:02:12.294 --> 01:02:15.086
I remember Jan,
my brother, saying...

01:02:15.753 --> 01:02:18.754
Uh, "Don't worry,
you'll be better in a few weeks."

01:02:19.754 --> 01:02:22.879
You know, hopefully making that...
making that assumption.

01:02:22.962 --> 01:02:27.087
And some people do recover
from, um, strokes very quickly.

01:02:28.588 --> 01:02:32.379
But, in my case, language-wise,
I certainly didn't.

01:02:33.046 --> 01:02:35.337
So, now I'm thinking...

01:02:35.421 --> 01:02:40.089
maybe none of...
me will recover quickly ever.

01:02:41.338 --> 01:02:45.839
Anything can happen
at any time to any degree.

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:49.548
Um, so...

01:02:50.715 --> 01:02:54.590
I better not have faith in anything.

01:02:58.758 --> 01:03:00.424
Mmm...

01:03:00.507 --> 01:03:02.900
- Here we are, "Provoked seizure."
- Here, yeah.

01:03:02.924 --> 01:03:05.466
- Did you ask him about provoked seizure?
- Yeah.

01:03:05.549 --> 01:03:08.717
- And what did he say about that?
- He doesn't really know.

01:03:08.759 --> 01:03:11.300
You know, Andy Elsmore is a surgeon.

01:03:11.383 --> 01:03:13.550
- A brain surgeon.
- Okay.

01:03:13.633 --> 01:03:16.177
- That's his specialty.
- Yeah.

01:03:16.259 --> 01:03:20.093
So anything else
needs to be referred to other people.

01:03:20.177 --> 01:03:21.634
In all fairness...

01:03:21.718 --> 01:03:25.301
it sounds like you got
no answers from him at all.

01:03:26.594 --> 01:03:27.719
Well...

01:03:28.469 --> 01:03:31.011
Well, what kind of answers would you like?

01:03:31.094 --> 01:03:34.719
Some answer.
Like, "I don't know" is an answer.

01:03:34.761 --> 01:03:36.012
Like what?

01:03:36.095 --> 01:03:40.636
Like, "Okay, what are these
flashes of light I had?"

01:03:40.720 --> 01:03:44.470
"Fits." "And should...
Should I have been told that they were?"

01:03:44.553 --> 01:03:47.054
He can't answer those questions.

01:03:47.138 --> 01:03:49.304
- Why not?
- Because he wasn't there.

01:03:49.387 --> 01:03:52.804
He doesn't know anything about it
other than what I've told him.

01:03:52.888 --> 01:03:54.638
And what did he say?

01:03:54.722 --> 01:03:56.222
He said, "I don't know."

01:03:57.430 --> 01:04:01.722
I was unaware actually, myself,
that there is a very high risk,

01:04:01.764 --> 01:04:03.388
a one-in-five risk pretty much,

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:06.015
of this happening anyway
if you've had a hemorrhage,

01:04:06.098 --> 01:04:07.473
in the first year after.

01:04:07.556 --> 01:04:10.098
So... ...you know...

01:04:10.182 --> 01:04:12.765
I should have probably
been more prepared for the fact

01:04:12.848 --> 01:04:14.515
that this kind of thing could happen.

01:04:14.599 --> 01:04:17.099
For some reason, we weren't,
I mean, as a family.

01:04:17.183 --> 01:04:19.016
And Lotje wasn't either.

01:04:20.766 --> 01:04:23.808
I mean, there's no way of knowing.
It's just like...

01:04:23.892 --> 01:04:25.017
It's just unfortunate.

01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:28.767
Well, the thing is, it's likely to have
been a provoked seizure, that's the thing,

01:04:28.808 --> 01:04:31.767
but it's just a question
of what provoked it.

01:04:32.767 --> 01:04:33.851
Yeah.

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:42.726
...very slowly.

01:04:42.768 --> 01:04:43.977
I was doing a lot better,

01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:46.977
but now I've gone backwards again
since this, uh...

01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.935
Show me if you can read this.

01:04:52.644 --> 01:04:54.103
- This?
- Yeah.

01:04:54.187 --> 01:04:55.936
Just take your time. Just...

01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:58.561
"John..."

01:04:59.853 --> 01:05:01.436
Gifford...

01:05:02.645 --> 01:05:06.395
"was... the... was the..."

01:05:06.479 --> 01:05:09.240
Just remind me again how long
the whole thing lasted for.

01:05:09.270 --> 01:05:10.771
When did your speech return?

01:05:10.854 --> 01:05:14.147
Well, the thing is that
the actual fits happened in hospital.

01:05:14.230 --> 01:05:16.063
- I see.
- So it was many, many hours.

01:05:16.147 --> 01:05:19.189
It's probably about...
Um, after the fits, Lotje slept.

01:05:19.271 --> 01:05:22.647
So by the time she was speaking again,
it was nine o'clock in the evening.

01:05:22.731 --> 01:05:23.773
Okay.

01:05:23.814 --> 01:05:28.481
Whether the seizures were triggered
or made worse by the treatment

01:05:28.564 --> 01:05:29.856
is difficult to answer.

01:05:29.939 --> 01:05:31.583
- I have a question...
- Yes?

01:05:31.607 --> 01:05:34.523
...which is, um, the flashes,
were they seizures or not?

01:05:34.607 --> 01:05:37.857
- Uh, they're not seizures, per Se.
- Mmm.

01:05:37.940 --> 01:05:40.815
I think it may be that the brain
was sort of primed.

01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:43.649
Uh, you've got, uh,
abnormal brain there anyway.

01:05:43.733 --> 01:05:46.858
So it may be they conspired
to give rise to what was,

01:05:46.941 --> 01:05:49.483
what sounded like
a very prolonged seizure.

01:05:50.483 --> 01:05:52.442
In a very small proportion of patients,

01:05:52.525 --> 01:05:55.442
generalized seizures can carry fatality,
actually.

01:05:55.525 --> 01:05:57.234
And certainly patients can die,

01:05:57.317 --> 01:05:58.960
for example,
in their sleep from a seizure.

01:05:58.984 --> 01:06:02.068
So, generalized seizures
certainly need to be treated.

01:06:14.527 --> 01:06:20.320
Here I am on my last visitation
to Queen Square.

01:06:20.403 --> 01:06:23.112
Curious to see...

01:06:24.987 --> 01:06:29.154
...how much worse... off I am...

01:06:29.237 --> 01:06:30.654
than I was...

01:06:31.613 --> 01:06:33.696
before the...

01:06:36.863 --> 01:06:38.404
the fits set in...

01:06:39.655 --> 01:06:42.739
and certainly disturbed and destroyed...

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:47.614
my brain and my mind.

01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:08.158
So, this graph...

01:07:08.241 --> 01:07:11.950
it turned out that you had
the tDCS in the first week.

01:07:12.034 --> 01:07:16.242
'Cause, remember, we were blinded to that,
so we had to, um, unblind ourselves.

01:07:16.325 --> 01:07:19.160
And the biggest improvement was,
in fact, in the first week.

01:07:19.243 --> 01:07:21.035
So you can see that your reading speeds,

01:07:21.118 --> 01:07:23.160
actually for both trained
and untrained words,

01:07:23.243 --> 01:07:25.659
um, both of them increased dramatically.

01:07:25.743 --> 01:07:27.534
- Oh, wow.
- Quite dramatically there.

01:07:27.618 --> 01:07:31.244
So you've gone from an average
of around about 2.2 seconds per word

01:07:31.327 --> 01:07:34.452
down to an average of about 1.5 seconds.

01:07:34.535 --> 01:07:37.411
That's about 40% improvement
in reading speed, something like that.

01:07:37.495 --> 01:07:38.620
- Wow.
- Yeah.

01:07:38.703 --> 01:07:41.037
- So that's quite impressive.
- That's great.

01:07:41.120 --> 01:07:42.578
- So that is good news.
- Thank you.

01:07:42.661 --> 01:07:46.411
Well, it's all your hard work, really.
And we would predict this.

01:07:46.495 --> 01:07:49.205
So, generally speaking,
there's a big effect of practice.

01:07:49.287 --> 01:07:52.829
But there's a hint here
that there's an effect of the tDCS.

01:07:52.913 --> 01:07:55.496
Scientifically, it's unfortunate
because you had the seizure,

01:07:55.579 --> 01:07:57.371
that the last time point
would've helped us.

01:07:57.455 --> 01:08:00.455
So, if you hadn't had the fit
and you had gone down again here,

01:08:00.538 --> 01:08:01.723
in other words,
you'd improved again,

01:08:01.747 --> 01:08:05.538
that would've been good evidence that
there wasn't a real effect of the tDCS,

01:08:05.622 --> 01:08:08.790
but because we lost that last time point,
we can't really answer that question.

01:08:08.831 --> 01:08:10.099
I'm sorry about that.

01:08:10.123 --> 01:08:12.790
It's not your fault.
Absolutely not your fault at all.

01:08:16.166 --> 01:08:18.999
The data that we got from you,
we are very encouraged by.

01:08:19.082 --> 01:08:22.041
And we're using this to put together

01:08:22.124 --> 01:08:24.791
a grant application to,
obviously to do it in more subjects.

01:08:24.874 --> 01:08:28.000
So all of this stuff, you know,
promising, but not conclusive,

01:08:28.082 --> 01:08:31.416
is gonna go into an application
to try and do it on a bigger level.

01:08:31.500 --> 01:08:34.750
Did I understand
correctly that, um...

01:08:34.792 --> 01:08:39.210
you're not going to be testing any more
zapping on brain hemorrhage people?

01:08:39.292 --> 01:08:40.518
Yeah, I think we'll...

01:08:40.542 --> 01:08:43.751
We'll probably put that in
as one of the exclusion criteria.

01:08:43.792 --> 01:08:46.460
Obviously, we want to be safe,
but on the other hand,

01:08:46.542 --> 01:08:48.752
if you exclude a load of people
in these studies,

01:08:48.794 --> 01:08:51.627
then when you finally publish it, um...

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:54.002
there will be no evidence
for a certain proportion.

01:08:54.085 --> 01:08:56.711
So I'm always a little bit wary
about excluding people,

01:08:56.795 --> 01:08:59.502
because as soon as you start
excluding a certain type of person,

01:08:59.586 --> 01:09:03.170
it then means that whatever you find
cannot be generalized to those people.

01:09:04.252 --> 01:09:06.796
Okay. I wouldn't want to be,
you know...

01:09:06.837 --> 01:09:09.462
I wouldn't want to contribute
to people missing out

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:12.046
on potentially helpful treatment.

01:09:12.129 --> 01:09:14.171
But, um...
But, yeah, at the same time...

01:09:14.255 --> 01:09:16.421
- Uh, well, it's not...
- ...having a fit isn't fun.

01:09:16.505 --> 01:09:18.689
It's not really a decision for you
or a decision for me.

01:09:18.712 --> 01:09:21.633
There's a group of us, and, ultimately,
it's down to the ethics committee.

01:09:21.712 --> 01:09:23.796
So they decide what is safe
and what isn't.

01:09:24.798 --> 01:09:29.506
I mean, if there is a safety issue, then,
surely it's a good thing to exclude those.

01:09:29.589 --> 01:09:33.215
I think it's something
that we're all discussing.

01:09:33.296 --> 01:09:35.256
- Yeah.
- Okay.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:48.925
Okay, so it didn't work.
Is that what you're hearing?

01:09:49.008 --> 01:09:50.883
No, it did work, there's a 60...

01:09:50.966 --> 01:09:54.634
There's 40% increase of improvement
in the first week.

01:09:54.717 --> 01:09:58.176
Okay, I can't read this, then.
Can you explain it to me?

01:10:00.842 --> 01:10:03.802
Do you see... Do you see...

01:10:03.843 --> 01:10:06.343
I mean, to be honest,
I have no fucking idea.

01:10:06.426 --> 01:10:07.944
So basically, if the red line...

01:10:07.968 --> 01:10:10.760
There's a 40% increase
in the first week,

01:10:10.802 --> 01:10:13.344
and then it flatlines out.

01:10:19.094 --> 01:10:24.386
It terrifies me that death
can just spring up out of nowhere,

01:10:24.470 --> 01:10:28.970
and, um, threaten to take me away.

01:10:29.054 --> 01:10:32.263
I mean, that could happen
to anybody at any time.

01:11:13.642 --> 01:11:17.642
My first holiday
since my brain was broken

01:11:17.725 --> 01:11:22.101
with the magical Miss Lucy McRae.

01:11:27.434 --> 01:11:30.186
This is undoubtedly the cure.

01:11:31.102 --> 01:11:34.894
The brain needs to be quiet
to perform its function.

01:11:34.977 --> 01:11:35.977
Quiet.

01:11:39.978 --> 01:11:43.520
I feel much closer to my consciousness,

01:11:43.603 --> 01:11:49.020
a much more raw closeness to the self

01:11:49.103 --> 01:11:52.437
that is the essence of me.

01:11:52.521 --> 01:11:57.271
If the physical body,
the brain, is damaged,

01:11:57.354 --> 01:12:01.355
does this extend to damage to the self?

01:12:02.438 --> 01:12:07.272
I need to be comfortable with...
with subtle,

01:12:07.355 --> 01:12:11.940
or some may say "unsubtle" differences

01:12:12.023 --> 01:12:16.606
between who I was before
and who I am now.

01:12:18.106 --> 01:12:23.565
In meditation, I've discovered
the fragility of the mind

01:12:23.649 --> 01:12:27.191
and also its limitless resources.

01:12:27.274 --> 01:12:32.234
And in that discovery,
I've become empowered.

01:12:36.817 --> 01:12:39.818
The silence, solitude.

01:12:41.859 --> 01:12:42.901
Salut.

01:12:54.318 --> 01:12:55.652
No, a film.

01:13:00.945 --> 01:13:03.237
Ah, it's me.

01:13:06.361 --> 01:13:08.821
- Is it your garden?
- Yes.

01:13:08.862 --> 01:13:09.987
Ah.

01:13:10.071 --> 01:13:13.821
It's very peaceful here, there's no noise.

01:13:16.530 --> 01:13:22.113
I'm here every day and there's no noise.
Apart from when I'm on my tractor.

01:13:22.197 --> 01:13:22.988
Yeah?

01:13:23.072 --> 01:13:27.031
Yes, I mean, the tractor makes noise.
Or when I use the trimmer...

01:13:27.114 --> 01:13:29.031
To cut the grass.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:33.156
But otherwise there's no noise.

01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.823
No.

01:13:41.032 --> 01:13:42.949
Just breathe.

01:13:44.241 --> 01:13:48.158
Don't panic. Let go of fear.

01:14:03.867 --> 01:14:06.827
Okay. I hope to be able to share with you

01:14:06.910 --> 01:14:13.868
some insights from my own recovery of, um,
my intracerebral brain hemorrhage.

01:14:13.952 --> 01:14:17.953
Cognition seems a very complex
and mysterious thing, um,

01:14:18.036 --> 01:14:19.911
that I've tried to get my own head around.

01:14:19.994 --> 01:14:23.161
So I hope I can share
some of those insights with you,

01:14:23.245 --> 01:14:25.578
but I'm not sure if I can.

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:31.120
Um, I think one of the challenges,
probably, for therapists is to...

01:14:31.204 --> 01:14:32.870
to just deal with the fact that you...

01:14:32.954 --> 01:14:37.579
you know, you have to work with somebody
who is being assessed

01:14:37.663 --> 01:14:40.830
and somebody who is being defined
by their limitations,

01:14:40.913 --> 01:14:46.539
because that's the only way to figure out
how to make them better.

01:14:46.622 --> 01:14:50.831
And I think just the experience of,
sort of, continually being defined by

01:14:50.872 --> 01:14:54.331
what you can no longer do,
or how you're sort of limited,

01:14:54.414 --> 01:14:57.665
becomes, I think, devastating.

01:14:57.748 --> 01:15:02.665
Is there anything that you could
advise us, as therapists, um...

01:15:02.748 --> 01:15:05.833
to help you get through that?

01:15:05.874 --> 01:15:08.474
Or do you think there was no other way
that we could have done it,

01:15:08.499 --> 01:15:10.083
but said it like it was?

01:15:10.166 --> 01:15:15.375
To maybe focus on things that
a patient might find along the way.

01:15:15.458 --> 01:15:20.959
Where they're always, um,
initially defined by what they can't do,

01:15:21.042 --> 01:15:24.043
they may discover something
that they weren't expecting at all,

01:15:24.126 --> 01:15:27.210
which is certainly
what happened in my case.

01:15:32.502 --> 01:15:35.002
Dear Mr. Lynch:

01:15:35.086 --> 01:15:37.961
My name is Lotje Sodderland.

01:15:39.044 --> 01:15:43.128
Almost exactly a year ago,
I had a brain hemorrhage.

01:15:43.753 --> 01:15:45.878
It doesn't feel like a year,

01:15:45.962 --> 01:15:50.670
'cause time has taken on
a different dimension.

01:15:50.753 --> 01:15:56.504
I was trying to relearn my reading faculty
with a therapist.

01:15:56.587 --> 01:15:59.337
And something struck me in those words

01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:04.755
that completely changed
my experience of recovery.

01:16:04.839 --> 01:16:08.005
I've learnt that I'm strong,

01:16:08.089 --> 01:16:13.381
but I've also accepted my vulnerability.

01:16:13.464 --> 01:16:16.923
I've learnt to focus only...

01:16:19.548 --> 01:16:21.757
on what matters.

01:16:21.841 --> 01:16:25.382
It just takes a very long time...

01:16:26.465 --> 01:16:29.924
to get used to a new brain.

01:16:30.007 --> 01:16:33.967
Please find
attached the tenancy agreement.

01:16:34.050 --> 01:16:37.050
Please initial each page where prompted.

01:16:37.133 --> 01:16:40.717
I don't need to return to my old life.

01:16:40.801 --> 01:16:44.759
This is a new existence, a new dynamic,

01:16:44.843 --> 01:16:49.467
where I wasn't defined by my limitations,

01:16:49.551 --> 01:16:53.385
but rather about endless possibility.

01:16:54.635 --> 01:16:56.635
Thank you, Mr. Lynch.

01:17:01.886 --> 01:17:07.928
A really, really important
part of this story has been this film.

01:17:09.179 --> 01:17:13.929
The film was something that was
absolutely born of necessity.

01:17:14.012 --> 01:17:20.847
It's created a way for me to understand
something that's extremely complex,

01:17:20.888 --> 01:17:23.429
and it's created a structure.

01:17:23.513 --> 01:17:28.681
Yeah, a narrative structure
for me to understand my own story.

01:17:28.764 --> 01:17:30.764
Happy face.

01:17:30.848 --> 01:17:33.181
We don't really know the answers.

01:17:33.265 --> 01:17:37.181
But what I can say
in this second of existence,

01:17:37.265 --> 01:17:39.224
reality...

01:17:39.307 --> 01:17:41.057
is only...

01:17:41.849 --> 01:17:46.515
what we believe and perceive to be true.

01:17:46.598 --> 01:17:49.766
That makes absolute sense to me.

01:17:52.016 --> 01:17:54.267
And very little does these days.

01:17:56.808 --> 01:18:00.934
Everybody loves a story.
And this is a really good one.

01:18:01.017 --> 01:18:06.226
With a beginning and a very long middle,
and it will have an end.

01:18:06.309 --> 01:18:09.685
The story will have an end.
The experience probably won't.

01:18:30.104 --> 01:18:32.854
Hi, David. My name's Lotje Sodderland.

01:18:33.770 --> 01:18:35.312
Are you Lotje Sodderland?

01:18:35.395 --> 01:18:36.855
I am.

01:18:36.938 --> 01:18:39.188
Lotje, it's so good to hear your voice.

01:18:39.272 --> 01:18:45.188
I can't see you, Lotje, but I wanna say,
I loved your video letter to me.

01:18:45.272 --> 01:18:47.772
And I'm very happy, as I told you,

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:50.522
that you found meditation

01:18:50.605 --> 01:18:53.564
and you're enjoying it
and enjoying the benefits.

01:18:53.647 --> 01:18:57.274
So, uh, what was your question
you'd like to ask tonight, Lotje?

01:18:57.356 --> 01:19:00.773
I wanted to thank you, first of all,
for inviting me this evening,

01:19:00.857 --> 01:19:04.857
but also for transforming my, um...

01:19:04.940 --> 01:19:06.858
um, my experience.

01:19:06.899 --> 01:19:12.566
Not only of a very sort of
devastating brain injury recovery,

01:19:12.649 --> 01:19:17.859
but also of my sort of
perception of existence.

01:19:17.942 --> 01:19:20.692
And, um... And my question to you was,

01:19:20.775 --> 01:19:26.860
do you think the brain
is the engine of the mind or vice versa?

01:19:27.818 --> 01:19:32.401
They say consciousness
is the driver of everything.

01:19:32.484 --> 01:19:34.485
The brain is a beautiful thing.

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:39.027
And now with brain research,
they can see on the EEG machine

01:19:39.111 --> 01:19:45.279
that when a person truly transcends,
they see a wondrous thing.

01:19:45.361 --> 01:19:50.862
Boom! The full brain lights up.
They call it "total brain coherence."

01:19:50.903 --> 01:19:54.654
And it's the only experience
in life that does that.

01:19:54.737 --> 01:19:57.779
That coherence gets
more and more permanent,

01:19:57.863 --> 01:20:00.445
giving rise to
higher states of consciousness,

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:06.322
and ultimately supreme enlightenment,
which is total fulfillment,

01:20:06.405 --> 01:20:08.322
total liberation,

01:20:08.405 --> 01:20:11.697
a state they describe as
"more than the most,"

01:20:11.780 --> 01:20:13.323
living totality.
