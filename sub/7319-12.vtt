WEBVTT

00:12.033 --> 00:14.267
PREVIOUSLY
ON "GREY'S ANATOMY"...

00:14.300 --> 00:16.067
YOU'RE WATCHING ME SLEEP AGAIN?
IT'S JUST THAT
YOU SNORE A LITTLE.

00:16.100 --> 00:18.800
(George) HAROLD O'MALLEY, 63,
SCHEDULED FOR

00:18.833 --> 00:20.800
A TRANSHIATAL ESOPHAGECTOMY
TOMORROW MORNING AT 9:00.

00:20.833 --> 00:24.567
I WANT YOU TO TAKE
THE TUMOR OUT.
AS THINGS PROGRESS WITH MY DAD,

00:24.600 --> 00:27.533
IT WOULD HELP ME
IF YOU WERE STRAIGHT WITH ME.
OKAY.

00:27.567 --> 00:29.467
SO THAT'S IT?
WE'RE CLOSING HIM BACK UP?
NO.

00:29.500 --> 00:32.567
BUT I THOUGHT--
THE PATIENT ASKED US
TO PROCEED.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.833
YOU WANT TO WATCH THE KIDNEYS
BECAUSE IF THE KIDNEYS FAIL,

00:34.867 --> 00:38.167
THAT'S A SIGN THAT EVERYTHING
ELSE IS STARTING TO GO.

00:38.200 --> 00:41.133
130 ccs OF SHINY,
YELLOW URINE!
THAT IS FANTASTIC! MM.

00:41.167 --> 00:43.167
(Izzie) HEATHER DOUGLAS, 17,

00:43.200 --> 00:44.833
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY
OF VATER SYNDROME.

00:44.867 --> 00:47.367
I THINK I COULD SIGNIFICANTLY
HELP WITH THE SPINAL CURVATURE.

00:47.400 --> 00:49.300
I GET TO SCRUB IN.
NOT TILL I SAY SO.

00:49.333 --> 00:51.633
I DEPOSITED THE DAMN CHECK.
INSURANCE BASTARDS.

00:51.667 --> 00:54.100
THE SURGERY'S
TOO EXPERIMENTAL.

00:54.133 --> 00:55.833
LOOKS LIKE THERE WON'T BE
A SURGERY TO SCRUB IN ON.

00:55.867 --> 00:57.800
SORRY, STEVENS.
YOU DON'T GET THE HIGH HORSE
THIS WEEK, ADDISON.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.267
NOT THIS WEEK.
(Cristina) DR. BURKE'S HAND--

01:00.300 --> 01:02.733
HAS HE HAD ANY TREMORS?
(Meredith) TALK TO HIM.

01:02.767 --> 01:05.100
NO. 'CAUSE THEN HE WINS.
(Meredith) MY FATHER'S HERE.

01:05.133 --> 01:07.167
THE ONE I DON'T TALK TO
AND BARELY KNOW? HE'S HERE.

01:07.200 --> 01:09.300
IF YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO PLASTICS...

01:09.333 --> 01:12.200
NAH.

01:12.233 --> 01:13.500
OH!

01:16.533 --> 01:18.067
(alarm buzzing)

01:18.067 --> 01:20.767
(snoring)

01:20.800 --> 01:22.733
***

01:22.767 --> 01:25.233
ALL RIGHT!
JUST SHUT IT OFF, PLEASE!

01:25.267 --> 01:27.133
COULD YOU NOT SNAP AT ME?

01:27.167 --> 01:28.667
(alarm stops)

01:28.700 --> 01:30.533
I DIDN'T SLEEP MUCH.

01:30.567 --> 01:32.733
MAYBE THAT'S BECAUSE YOU WERE
TOO BUSY SHOVING ME

01:32.767 --> 01:34.667
EVERY FIVE MINUTES.
I WASN'T SHOVING YOU.

01:34.700 --> 01:36.200
I WAS NUDGING YOU

01:36.233 --> 01:38.100
TO STOP
THE VERY LOUD SAWING OF WOOD.

01:38.133 --> 01:39.467
I WORE THE NOSE STRIP.

01:39.500 --> 01:42.167
OH, IT'S CUTE,
BUT IT DOESN'T WORK.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.367
OW.
WHAT?

01:43.400 --> 01:45.067
YOU NEED TO SHAVE.

01:45.100 --> 01:46.300
OH.

01:46.333 --> 01:48.767
***

01:48.800 --> 01:49.733
OH.

01:49.767 --> 01:53.067

01:56.633 --> 01:59.700
IZZIE, UH...

02:05.367 --> 02:07.400

02:07.433 --> 02:09.767
HERE. MOVE, MOVE, MOVE.
DID YOU--

02:09.800 --> 02:12.267
NOT--IT--IT'S NOT HERE.

02:12.300 --> 02:13.767
IZZIE, IT'S NOT HERE.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.133
I DEPOSITED IT, OKAY?

02:16.167 --> 02:18.067
YOU DIDN'T DEPOSIT IT
IN THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL

02:18.067 --> 02:19.800
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
DID YOU?

02:19.833 --> 02:21.700
IT'S AT THE BANK,
OKAY, GEORGE?

02:21.733 --> 02:24.600
NOW JUST SHUT UP
ABOUT IT ALREADY.

02:24.633 --> 02:26.533
IT'S AT--IT'S AT THE BANK?

02:26.567 --> 02:28.333
IT'S--
IT'S EARNING INTEREST?

02:28.367 --> 02:30.833
DID I NOT JUST SAY,
"SHUT UP ABOUT IT ALREADY"?

02:30.867 --> 02:33.233
IZZIE...
IT'S REAL NOW.

02:33.267 --> 02:34.700
I--THAT MONEY,

02:34.733 --> 02:36.633
IT COULD--
THE MONEY COULD TRAVEL.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.533
IT COULD--IT COULD BUY THINGS.

02:38.567 --> 02:40.467
IT COULD BUY MANY,
MANY THINGS.

02:40.500 --> 02:42.400
THAT'S A--
THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY, IZZIE.

02:42.433 --> 02:43.733
SHUT UP ABOUT IT, GEORGE.

02:43.767 --> 02:45.267
I'M JUST SAYING--

02:45.300 --> 02:47.367
I'M JUST SAYING,
LIFE IS SHORT.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.200
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE,
CANCER HAPPENS

02:50.233 --> 02:52.367
AND SURGERY HAPPENS,
AND I--

02:52.400 --> 02:55.367
YOU KNOW, IT'S JUST--
IT'S JUST--

02:55.400 --> 02:57.100
"GATHER YE ROSEBUDS"...

02:57.133 --> 03:00.700
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
8.7 MILLION ROSEBUDS, IZZIE.

03:00.733 --> 03:02.667
YOU GOTTA SPEND
SOME ROSEBUDS.

03:02.700 --> 03:04.767
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

03:08.500 --> 03:10.333
YOU MADE ME BURN
MY FRENCH TOAST.

03:10.367 --> 03:12.533
YOU CAN BUY
NEW FRENCH TOAST.

03:19.667 --> 03:22.067
(ferry horn blows)

03:32.467 --> 03:34.333
OH.

03:34.367 --> 03:36.333
HEY. UH, I WAS, UH--

03:36.367 --> 03:39.167
YEAH, I WAS JUST, UH,

GOOD. THAT'S--THAT'S GOOD.
YEAH.

03:42.800 --> 03:45.233
DOCTORS.
YES.

03:45.267 --> 03:46.600
WHAT?
I WAS WONDERING,
THE BABY LOOKS...

03:46.633 --> 03:49.533
(Addison and Alex) GOOD.
YEAH, SHE'S GOOD.

03:49.567 --> 03:51.567
GOOD. SHE LOOKS GOOD.
SHE IS. SHE'S, UH...

03:51.600 --> 03:54.533
SHE'S GOOD? SHE'S--
SHE'S OUT OF THE WOODS?
SHE IS. SHE'S, UH...

03:54.567 --> 03:57.067
SHE'S GOOD.
SHE IS OUT OF THE WOODS.

03:57.100 --> 03:58.433
HER VITALS ARE STRONG.

03:58.467 --> 04:00.733
UH, SHE MADE IT THROUGH
THE NIGHT,

04:00.767 --> 04:03.367
AND SHE'S, UH...
SHE'S A FIGHTER. (laughs)

04:03.400 --> 04:05.633
GOOD. SO I CAN TELL MY WIFE
AND MY DAUGHTER?

04:05.667 --> 04:07.300
YOU CAN.

04:07.333 --> 04:09.233
AND YOU SHOULD.

04:09.267 --> 04:11.167
OH, THANK YOU.
THANK YOU BOTH SO MUCH.

04:11.200 --> 04:13.067
MM-HMM.

04:14.367 --> 04:16.567
(clears throat)

04:18.367 --> 04:19.400
SORRY.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.533
YEAH. YEAH.
NO, SHE'S OUT OF THE WOODS.

04:29.567 --> 04:31.467
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

04:31.500 --> 04:35.067
HOW AM I RELATED
TO THAT MAN?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:35.067 --> 04:37.767
NO, NO, NO, NO. WHEN SHE--
I MEAN, LOOK AT HIM.
HE'S A MESS.

04:37.800 --> 04:39.700
YEAH?
OH. UH, HOLD ON.
YEAH, HOLD ON.

04:39.733 --> 04:42.433
I MEAN, HE'S A DISASTER...
(muffled) HOLD ON. HOLD ON.
HOLD ON.

04:42.467 --> 04:44.367
HE'S A STAMMERING, MUMBLING,
CLUMSY DISASTER

04:44.400 --> 04:46.700
WITH WHOM I HAVE ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING IN COMMON,

04:46.733 --> 04:48.233
NOT ONE THING.

04:48.267 --> 04:51.300
NO, NO, SHE'S--
NO, THEY SAID THAT...

04:51.333 --> 04:54.200
(laughs) I HATE
TO BREAK THIS TO YOU...

04:54.233 --> 04:55.433
WHAT?

04:55.467 --> 04:57.367
WELL, YOU KNOW,
YOU DO YOUR OWN SHARE

04:57.400 --> 04:58.733
OF STAMMERING YOURSELF.

04:58.767 --> 05:00.700
YEAH, THAT NERVOUS TALKING
THING YOU DO?

05:00.733 --> 05:02.533
IT'S ACTUALLY
A LOT LIKE HIM.
(Cristina) MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

05:02.567 --> 05:04.467
(Thatcher) YEAH,
THAT'S WHY I'M SO HAPPY.
NO, IT'S NOT.

05:04.500 --> 05:06.400
PLUS THAT MESSY THING.
OH, TOTALLY.

05:06.433 --> 05:07.400
YOU'RE THE MESSY ONE.

05:07.433 --> 05:10.200
NO, MY APARTMENT'S MESSY,
MY LOCKER'S MESSY,

05:10.233 --> 05:12.800
BUT I AM NOT MESSY.
(laughs)

05:12.833 --> 05:16.133
SOMETIMES YOU HAVE, LIKE,
FOOD AND STUFF IN YOUR HAIR.

05:16.167 --> 05:18.100
YEAH, FOOD.
BAND-AIDS ON YOUR FACE.

05:18.133 --> 05:19.600
MM-HMM.
I CAN STILL KINDA SEE

05:19.633 --> 05:21.767
THAT INDENTATION FROM
THE NOSE STRIP YOU WERE WEARING

05:21.800 --> 05:22.800
LAST NIGHT.

05:22.833 --> 05:26.500
WITH NO WORDS.

05:26.533 --> 05:29.067
AND YOU ARE A MILLIONAIRE
IN $20 SHOES.

05:29.100 --> 05:31.367
WHATEVER.

05:31.400 --> 05:32.433
UM...

05:32.467 --> 05:35.133
OH, MY GOD...
SHE'S JUST LIKE HIM.

05:35.167 --> 05:37.100
RIGHT? (laughs)
WOW.

05:37.133 --> 05:38.667
(pager beeps)

05:38.700 --> 05:41.433
DR. BAILEY, YOU PAGED ME?

05:41.467 --> 05:42.667
YES, I DID.

05:42.700 --> 05:46.267
WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED WITH
HEATHER'S SURGERY, AS SCHEDULED.

05:46.300 --> 05:48.600
THE INSURANCE COMPANY
CHANGED THEIR MIND?

05:48.633 --> 05:50.600
NO. BETTER.

05:50.633 --> 05:52.533
IT SEEMS AN ANONYMOUS DONOR
HAS OFFERED TO FOOT

05:52.567 --> 05:55.133
HEATHER'S ENTIRE BILL.

05:55.167 --> 05:57.333
WOW. THAT IS INCREDIBLE.
YOU'RE A VERY LUCKY GIRL.

05:57.367 --> 06:00.267
HEY, THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
ANYONE'S EVER SAID

06:00.300 --> 06:02.267
THAT SENTENCE TO ME
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

06:02.300 --> 06:04.200
I LIKE IT.

06:16.800 --> 06:20.067
YOU SPENT 300 GRAND
SO YOU COULD SCRUB IN

06:20.100 --> 06:21.400
ON THIS SURGERY?
NO.

06:21.433 --> 06:22.600
NO?

06:24.733 --> 06:26.500
I-I SPENT THE 3--

06:26.533 --> 06:28.133
HAVE YOU SEEN THAT GIRL?

06:28.167 --> 06:31.267
HER LIFE IS MISERABLE.
SHE'S DESPERATE.

06:31.300 --> 06:34.167
SHE--SHE'LL NEVER HAVE A DATE,
SHE'LL NEVER WEAR HIGH HEELS,

06:34.200 --> 06:35.533
SHE'LL NEVER FEEL NORMAL.

06:35.567 --> 06:37.433
I-I SPENT 300 GRAND
BECAUSE IT--

06:37.467 --> 06:40.067
IT'S A GOOD THING.

06:43.767 --> 06:45.633
I WAS HOPING
YOU WOULD TELL ME

06:45.667 --> 06:48.667
YOU SPENT THE MONEY
SO YOU COULD SCRUB IN.

06:48.700 --> 06:49.700
BUT I--

06:49.733 --> 06:53.400
YOU NEED TO DECIDE WHETHER
OR NOT YOU'RE A SURGEON.

06:53.433 --> 06:55.267
BECAUSE THIS THING YOU DID--

06:55.300 --> 06:57.700
THIS IS LOVELY AND GENEROUS,

06:57.733 --> 07:01.400
AND I'M NOT TRYING TO TAKE AWAY
FROM ANY OF THAT, BUT...

07:01.433 --> 07:04.167
YOU ARE, ONCE AGAIN,
OVERLY INVOLVED.

07:04.200 --> 07:06.300
ONCE AGAIN,
YOU ARE PERSONALLY INVOLVED,

07:06.333 --> 07:09.800
SO... NO, I'M SORRY.

07:09.833 --> 07:13.167
YOU CANNOT SCRUB IN.
(sighs)

07:28.233 --> 07:31.100
***

07:37.767 --> 07:40.067
GEORGE KISSED ME.

07:40.100 --> 07:40.900
YESTERDAY.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.533
ONE MINUTE HE'S HOLDING
A URINE BAG,

07:42.567 --> 07:44.467
THE NEXT MINUTE,
HE'S KISSING ME.

07:44.500 --> 07:46.367
***

07:46.400 --> 07:49.433
(sighs) YOU THINK HE'S JUST
FREAKING OUT ABOUT HIS DAD?

07:49.467 --> 07:51.133
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,
YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:51.167 --> 07:52.333
HE'S PROBABLY JUST
FREAKING OUT.

07:52.367 --> 07:54.267
I SHOULDN'T
HOLD HIM TO IT.

07:54.300 --> 07:56.067
OH, MAN.
WHAT?

07:56.067 --> 07:58.067
***

07:58.067 --> 08:00.733
DID YOU NOT JUST HEAR
A WORD I SAID?

08:00.767 --> 08:02.667
I'M POURING
MY HEART OUT HERE.

08:02.700 --> 08:04.600
JEEZ. IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU,
ISN'T IT?

08:04.633 --> 08:07.700
IT'S ALL ABOUT A--
EVERYTHING'S ABOUT ADDISON.

08:07.733 --> 08:10.633
I ABORTED MARK'S BABY.

08:10.667 --> 08:14.167
IT IS ALL ABOUT YOU.

08:14.200 --> 08:15.633
FLOOR IS ALL YOURS.

08:15.667 --> 08:18.833
***

08:18.867 --> 08:21.500
ABOUT EIGHT MONTHS AGO.

08:21.533 --> 08:24.633
I...

08:24.667 --> 08:26.500
PEED ON A STICK,

08:26.533 --> 08:30.133
AND I WASN'T EVEN, UH...
GONNA TELL HIM,

08:30.167 --> 08:33.067
BUT THEN I DID...
TELL HIM.

08:33.100 --> 08:37.267
AND, UH, HE WENT OUT
AND HE BOUGHT THIS...

08:37.300 --> 08:41.067
INSANE YANKEES ONESIE

08:41.100 --> 08:45.100
AND A CALENDAR
AND MARKED THE DUE DATE,

08:45.133 --> 08:48.733
WHICH, I SHOULD MENTION,
WAS TODAY.

08:48.767 --> 08:50.667
YOU DIDN'T WANT A BABY?

08:50.700 --> 08:53.400
I WANTED DEREK.

08:53.433 --> 08:57.600
I WANTED TO HAVE
A BABY WITH DEREK.

08:57.633 --> 08:59.767
I NEVER THOUGHT
I'D END UP ALONE.

08:59.800 --> 09:03.533
HEY, YOU HAVE NOT
"ENDED UP" ANYWHERE.

09:03.567 --> 09:05.467
(chuckles) YEAH,
YOU'RE RIGHT, I KNOW.

09:05.500 --> 09:08.300
IT'S JUST THAT, UM...

09:08.333 --> 09:11.633
SOMETIMES IT FEELS THAT WAY,
YOU KNOW?

09:11.667 --> 09:15.167
THIS IS ONE OF THOSE WEEKS
IT FEELS THAT WAY.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.500
(sighs)

09:22.500 --> 09:25.067
(Derek) DRILL.

09:25.100 --> 09:26.433
ANOTHER SCREW, PLEASE.

09:26.467 --> 09:29.067
(drill whirring)

09:29.067 --> 09:30.400
HEY, HOW'S YOUR OLD MAN?

09:30.433 --> 09:31.767
HIS URINE OUTPUT'S
HOLDING STEADY.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.700
MOSTLY IT'S STEADY TODAY,
WHICH IS GOOD.

09:34.733 --> 09:36.733
HAVE YOU SEEN BURKE TODAY?

09:36.767 --> 09:40.133
EVEN IF I DID LIKE YOU,
I STILL WOULDN'T TELL YOU THAT.

09:40.167 --> 09:43.667
HOW CAN YOU BE OKAY
WITH BURKE BUT NOT CRISTINA?

09:43.700 --> 09:46.133
HER CAREER WASN'T ON THE LINE
WHEN SHE LIED TO ME.

09:46.167 --> 09:49.067
WHY DON'T YOU JUST ASK BURKE
ABOUT THE HAND YOURSELF?

09:49.067 --> 09:52.233
I AM NOT TALKING TO HIM.
HE OWES ME.
WHAT?

09:52.267 --> 09:55.200
OH, I DON'T KNOW.
SO YOU'RE TOGETHER, BUT YOU
DON'T TALK TO EACH OTHER?

09:55.233 --> 09:56.200
UH-HUH.

09:56.233 --> 09:58.533
(laughs) I WISH I COULD
FIND THAT IN A WOMAN.

09:58.567 --> 10:00.800
HEY, HOW'S IT GOING
WITH ADDISON?
WHAT?

10:00.833 --> 10:02.733
WHAT?
WHY--WHY--WHY WOULD YOU...

10:02.767 --> 10:06.333
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT DO YOU--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

10:06.367 --> 10:08.333
LAURA GREY, TINY BABY.

10:08.367 --> 10:09.667
LAURA. THE BABY. RIGHT.

10:09.700 --> 10:11.600
SHE'S, UH,
SHE'S, UM, DOING FINE.

10:11.633 --> 10:13.433
SHE'S DOING WELL.

10:13.467 --> 10:15.367
I GOTTA GET OUT
OF GYNIE, THOUGH.

10:15.400 --> 10:18.267
I GOTTA GET BACK TO SLOAN.

10:18.300 --> 10:21.300
WHAT ARE YOU PLOTTING,
AND CAN I GET IN ON IT?

10:21.333 --> 10:22.800
SHUT UP.

10:22.833 --> 10:24.467
OH.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.300
(laughs)

10:26.333 --> 10:29.200
AH! THIS IS MY SURGERY.
I SHOULD BE DOWN THERE.

10:29.233 --> 10:30.567
(pager beeps)

10:30.600 --> 10:32.167
(sighs)

10:32.200 --> 10:35.267
NO. EXCUSE ME.

10:35.300 --> 10:37.733
(pager beeps)

10:37.767 --> 10:39.733
MR. O'MALLEY.
(Izzie) 9-1-1?

10:39.767 --> 10:42.000
YEAH.

10:44.600 --> 10:46.500
SUCKS.

10:46.533 --> 10:48.400
YEAH.

10:48.433 --> 10:50.500
(Derek) RETRACTOR.
UM, DR. SHEPHERD,

10:50.533 --> 10:52.700
CAN YOU PROCEED
WITHOUT ME?
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

10:52.733 --> 10:55.233
THIS IS YOUR SURGERY, TORRES,

10:55.267 --> 10:58.233
THIS IS YOUR FIND,
AND YOU WANT TO LEAVE?
I, UM, I DON'T,

10:58.267 --> 10:59.767
BUT, UH, YES, I'M SORRY.

10:59.800 --> 11:02.367
BUT IF IT'S ALL RIGHT,
I NEED TO LEAVE.

11:04.600 --> 11:06.633
GIVE ME SOME SPONGES,
LAP SPONGES.

11:09.500 --> 11:12.400
OKAY, I CALLED THE FAMILY IN
BECAUSE I NEED TO PERFORM

11:12.433 --> 11:15.333
A PROCEDURE, UH, ON YOUR FATHER
TO HELP HIM BREATHE.

11:15.367 --> 11:18.433
ALL RIGHT, SO--SO YOU'RE
SAYING HE CAN'T BREATHE?

11:18.467 --> 11:22.067
UH, WITH THE EXTENSIVE SURGERY,

11:22.067 --> 11:25.200
UH, YOUR FATHER IS NOT
BREATHING ON HIS OWN,

11:25.233 --> 11:27.267
WHICH IS WHY WE STILL
HAVE HIM INTUBATED.

11:27.300 --> 11:29.500
INTUBATED?
THE TUBE IN DAD'S MOUTH.

11:29.533 --> 11:31.500
IT'S BREATHING FOR HIM.

11:31.533 --> 11:34.067
AND RIGHT NOW THAT TUBE
HAS A KINK IN IT,

11:34.067 --> 11:35.500
WHICH IS STRAINING
HIS BREATHING.

11:35.533 --> 11:37.433
HOW DID IT GET
A KINK IN IT?

11:37.467 --> 11:39.400
IT JUST HAPPENS.
WE DON'T ALWAYS KNOW WHY.

11:39.433 --> 11:41.533
BUT--BUT HE'S
DOING GOOD TODAY.

11:41.567 --> 11:44.167
I MEAN, HE MADE--HE MADE
PLENTY OF PEE, SO...

11:44.200 --> 11:45.833
STILL, WE NEED TO REPLACE
THE TUBE.

11:45.867 --> 11:48.700
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO IT? I
MEAN, WHAT ARE WE WAITING FOR?

11:48.733 --> 11:50.833
(exhales) OKAY, WITH THE DAMAGE
TO YOUR FATHER'S ESOPHAGUS

11:50.867 --> 11:52.767
AND THE SWELLING IN HIS THROAT

11:52.800 --> 11:54.700
FROM BEING INTUBATED
ALL THIS TIME--

11:54.733 --> 11:58.133
YOU MIGHT NOT BE ABLE
TO GET IT IN, THE NEW TUBE?

12:00.500 --> 12:02.767
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES...

12:02.800 --> 12:05.467
IT CAN BE
A COMPLICATED PROCEDURE.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.733
IF I'M NOT SUCCESSFUL...

12:08.767 --> 12:14.300
I'M SAYING, UH,
YOU NEED TO PREPARE YOURSELVES.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.433
(grunts)

12:33.700 --> 12:36.567
(Louise) WHAT IS THAT?

12:36.600 --> 12:38.667
IT'S JERRY.
I'M SORRY. I'M NERVOUS.

12:38.700 --> 12:40.133
(Louise) OH.

12:40.167 --> 12:41.467
OH, GOD.
OH!

12:41.500 --> 12:42.800
OH, MY GOD.

12:42.833 --> 12:44.733
MY GOD,
STOP IT, JERRY!
I'M NERVOUS!

12:44.767 --> 12:46.667
(laughs)
(passes gas)

12:46.700 --> 12:48.200
OH! FOR GOD'S SAKE,

12:48.233 --> 12:51.333
TAKE SOME CHARCOAL
OR SOMETHING, SON.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.833
(all laughing)

12:53.867 --> 12:56.467
(George) THAT'S DISGUSTING.
SHEESH.

12:56.500 --> 12:58.300
TYLER.

12:58.333 --> 12:59.667
YEAH.

12:59.700 --> 13:01.700
COULD YOU LET DR. BURKE KNOW

13:01.733 --> 13:03.633
THAT MR. O'MALLEY IS HAVING

13:03.667 --> 13:05.833
SOME KIND OF MEDICAL CRISIS
RIGHT NOW,

13:05.867 --> 13:08.833
AND I THOUGHT HE
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

13:08.867 --> 13:10.700
HE'S AWAKE, YOU KNOW?

13:13.267 --> 13:15.333
YEAH, I KNOW.

13:18.067 --> 13:20.333
YOU WANT TO HANDLE THIS,
CHIEF?
DR. BAILEY,

13:20.367 --> 13:22.733
YOU HAVE A LOT MORE HANDS-ON
HOURS THESE DAYS THAN I DO.

13:22.767 --> 13:25.667
I'LL BE STANDING BY TO HELP,
BUT THIS IS ALL YOURS.

13:25.700 --> 13:28.767
ALL RIGHT, GREY, LET ME HAVE
AN 8.0 E.T. TUBE.

13:28.800 --> 13:30.333
DR. BAILEY...

13:30.367 --> 13:32.367
THIS IS A PATIENT,
LIKE ANY OTHER PATIENT.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.700
THERE'S NO ROOM FOR ERROR,

13:34.733 --> 13:37.367
WHICH MEANS THERE'S NO ROOM
FOR NERVES,

13:37.400 --> 13:39.100
SO SHAKE IT OFF.

13:41.867 --> 13:43.633
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO THIS.

13:43.667 --> 13:46.333
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

13:47.833 --> 13:52.300
(Miranda) GREAT. 8.0.

13:52.333 --> 13:54.333
I CAN'T, UH...
(monitor beeping erratically)

13:54.367 --> 13:56.767
IS IT TOO TIGHT?
I CAN'T GET PAST
THE VOCAL CHORDS. DAMN IT.

13:56.800 --> 13:59.200
PULSE OX DOWN 88.

13:59.233 --> 14:00.533
DAMN IT.
86. COME ON, LET'S GO.

14:00.567 --> 14:03.767
COME ON, LET'S GO.
LET ME HAVE A 7 1/2.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.233
(beeping continues)

14:05.267 --> 14:06.700
HURRY.

14:06.733 --> 14:08.300
COME ON, COME ON, COME ON.

14:08.333 --> 14:09.833
GOOD.

14:09.867 --> 14:12.167
(beeping continues)

14:12.200 --> 14:13.667
LET ME GET A--
OKAY, I GOT IT.

14:13.700 --> 14:16.633
(monitor beeping rhythmically)

14:19.467 --> 14:22.433
BEAUTIFUL JOB. BEAUTIFUL JOB.

14:22.467 --> 14:24.400
OH, CAN I GO TELL GEORGE?

14:28.767 --> 14:31.833
DR. BAILEY, YOU ALL RIGHT?

14:31.867 --> 14:34.433
MY SON...
IS NAMED AFTER HIS SON.

14:34.467 --> 14:36.400
I JUST NEED A MINUTE.

14:45.833 --> 14:47.333
THERE'S A SURGERY,
YOU KNOW?

14:47.367 --> 14:49.233
IT'S A MINOR LASER THING.

14:49.267 --> 14:52.133
SUPPOSED TO REALLY HELP.
WE COULD LOOK INTO IT.

14:52.167 --> 14:53.067
SURE,
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,

14:53.067 --> 14:54.833
LET'S LOOK AT HALITOSIS CURES
FOR YOU.

14:54.867 --> 14:56.367
NOT TO MENTION STUBBLE CURES,

14:56.400 --> 14:58.767
BECAUSE IT'S NOW BECOME
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE

14:58.800 --> 15:00.700
FOR ME TO KISS YOUR FACE.

15:00.733 --> 15:04.067
I AM TOO TIRED TO SHAVE!

15:06.067 --> 15:07.800
SLOAN! DR. SLOAN.
BONE DRY CAPPUCCINO.

15:07.833 --> 15:09.733
AND I WATCHED 'EM
MAKE IT THIS TIME

15:09.767 --> 15:11.267
SO NO MISTAKES.

15:11.300 --> 15:13.167
HEY, I-I NOTICED YOU HAD
A RECONSTRUCTIVE RHINOPLASTY

15:13.200 --> 15:14.533
ON THE BOARD TODAY,

15:14.567 --> 15:18.267
AND I'D--I'D REALLY LIKE
TO SCRUB IN IF AT ALL POSSIBLE.

15:19.833 --> 15:22.267
YOU BEEN WORKING WITH ADDISON
THIS WEEK?

15:22.300 --> 15:23.800
YES, SIR, WORKING.

15:23.833 --> 15:26.433
WORKING... A LOT.
WORKING HARD.

15:26.467 --> 15:28.800
JUST... WORKING.

15:30.833 --> 15:32.567
IS SHE MISERABLE?

15:32.600 --> 15:34.567
I'M SORRY?

15:34.600 --> 15:36.633
IT'S JUST...

15:36.667 --> 15:39.733
I NEED TO KNOW IF SHE'S...

15:39.767 --> 15:42.067
AT LEAST MISERABLE
THIS WEEK.

15:42.067 --> 15:44.633
DID SHE SEEM...

15:44.667 --> 15:47.100
IS SHE MISERABLE?

15:47.133 --> 15:48.767
OH, DUDE, SHE'S AWFUL.

15:48.800 --> 15:50.133
SHE'S TORTURING ME.

15:50.167 --> 15:52.633
I SERIOUSLY HAVE TO GET
AWAY FROM THAT WOMAN.

15:52.667 --> 15:57.333
I MEAN, SHE IS COMPLETELY
AND UTTERLY, 100% MISERABLE.

15:57.367 --> 15:59.467
GOOD.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.833
SO CAN I SCRUB IN?

16:00.867 --> 16:03.200
NO.

16:03.233 --> 16:05.167
(sighs)

16:07.100 --> 16:08.267
ARE YOU SLEEPING?

16:08.300 --> 16:10.733
I SHOULD BE.
I HAVEN'T SLEPT IN DAYS.

16:10.767 --> 16:12.733
(sighs) ME NEITHER.

16:14.800 --> 16:16.700
I CAN'T SLEEP ALONE ANYMORE.

16:16.733 --> 16:21.100
I USED TO SLEEP JUST FINE,
AND THEN HE...

16:21.133 --> 16:24.733
(sighs) GOD, HE GETS ME
ALL STRUNG OUT ON HIM,

16:24.767 --> 16:26.267
AND THEN HE DISAPPEARS?

16:26.300 --> 16:28.333
HE DIDN'T DISAPPEAR.
HE'S IN THE HOSPITAL.

16:29.767 --> 16:32.167
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW HE'S DOING.

16:32.200 --> 16:34.067
YOU COULD JUST ASK HIM.

16:34.100 --> 16:36.067
UH, HE COULD JUST TELL ME.

16:36.067 --> 16:37.133
(laughs)

16:39.700 --> 16:44.133
GEORGE'S DAD IS GOING INTO
RENAL FAILURE.

16:44.167 --> 16:45.467
I HEARD.

16:45.500 --> 16:48.467
MY DAD'S HERE,
EVERYWHERE, EVERY DAY.

16:48.500 --> 16:50.167
HE'S PERFECTLY HEALTHY,

16:50.200 --> 16:52.567
AND I HAVE NOTHING
TO SAY TO HIM.

16:52.600 --> 16:55.267
IF GEORGE'S DAD DIES...

16:55.300 --> 16:57.667
I KNOW.

16:57.700 --> 17:00.800
IF THATCHER DIED, MY LIFE
WOULDN'T BE ANY DIFFERENT.

17:02.867 --> 17:06.400
IS IT WEIRD THAT I'M
A LITTLE JEALOUS OF GEORGE?

17:09.100 --> 17:11.100
YES.

17:14.400 --> 17:17.200
BAILEY RE-INTUBATED HIM,
BUT, UM...

17:17.233 --> 17:20.200
HE WAS WITHOUT OX-OXYGEN FOR,
I DON'T KNOW,

17:20.233 --> 17:21.667
A FEW MINUTES.

17:21.700 --> 17:24.333
O'MALLEY...

17:24.367 --> 17:25.800
THERE'S NO BLAME HERE.

17:27.633 --> 17:29.667
YOUR FATHER'S BODY
IS DISEASED

17:29.700 --> 17:32.800
AND HAS UNDERGONE
TREMENDOUS TRAUMA.

17:32.833 --> 17:36.300
NOW HIS ORGANS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

17:36.333 --> 17:39.100
THERE'S NO BLAME HERE.

17:39.133 --> 17:41.133
DO PEOPLE COME BACK
FROM THIS?

17:42.800 --> 17:44.700
HIS, UH, B.U.N.
AND CREATININE ARE HIGH.

17:44.733 --> 17:46.133
I GET THAT.

17:47.633 --> 17:50.600
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
IN--IN YOUR EXPERIENCE,

17:50.633 --> 17:53.200
CAN PEOPLE COME BACK
FROM THIS?

17:55.467 --> 17:57.367
I DON'T HAVE ANY STATISTICS.

17:57.400 --> 18:01.133
I DON'T HAVE
ANY MORE MEDICINE FOR YOU.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.700
(exhales)

18:02.733 --> 18:06.200
NOW IT'S ABOUT FAITH.

18:06.233 --> 18:08.767
WE'RE MEN OF SCIENCE.

18:08.800 --> 18:11.300
IN MY EXPERIENCE,

18:11.333 --> 18:13.600
SCIENCE IS NOT ENOUGH,
O'MALLEY.

18:13.633 --> 18:19.067
BUT IF YOU WANT ME
TO HOPE WITH YOU...

18:19.100 --> 18:21.400
IF YOU'D LIKE ME TO SEND UP
A PRAYER,

18:21.433 --> 18:24.800
THAT IS A THING
I'D BE HAPPY TO DO.

18:35.433 --> 18:37.633
YOU HAVE FAMILY HERE?

18:37.667 --> 18:40.500
YEAH, A DAUGHTER.

18:40.533 --> 18:42.200
SHE'S 17.

18:42.233 --> 18:44.067
(Louise) OH, I'M SO SORRY.

18:44.100 --> 18:45.733
YEAH.

18:45.767 --> 18:48.200
SHE HAD SURGERY
ON HER SPINE.

18:48.233 --> 18:50.800
AND THEY SAID
IT WENT WELL.

18:50.833 --> 18:54.533
BUT THEN SHE HAS TROUBLE
WITH HER KIDNEYS AND...

18:54.567 --> 18:57.333
WELL, SHE HASN'T WOKEN UP.

18:57.367 --> 19:00.600
MY HUSBAND EITHER.

19:00.633 --> 19:03.600
IT WAS A DANGEROUS SURGERY.

19:03.633 --> 19:05.133
THEY TOLD US THAT.

19:05.167 --> 19:07.400
MY HUSBAND'S, TOO.

19:07.433 --> 19:10.700
HE HAS... CANCER, SO...

19:10.733 --> 19:13.633
I WAS SURPRISED WHEN THEY
WENT THROUGH WITH IT.

19:13.667 --> 19:17.067
I THOUGHT
I'D BE TAKING HIM HOME.

19:20.767 --> 19:25.233
(Izzie) EXCUSE ME,
MRS. DOUGLAS.

19:25.267 --> 19:27.200
HEATHER IS ASKING FOR YOU.

19:27.233 --> 19:30.233
SHE WOKE UP?
SHE DID.

19:30.267 --> 19:33.067
AND SHE LOOKS GREAT.
(Louise) CONGRATULATIONS.

19:33.067 --> 19:34.233
THAT'S WONDERFUL.

19:34.267 --> 19:36.567
GOOD LUCK. I'LL...

19:36.600 --> 19:38.733
GOOD LUCK.

19:38.767 --> 19:40.400
THANKS.

19:47.867 --> 19:51.367
WHY DID YOU DO IT?
(Richard) DR. O'MALLEY.

19:51.400 --> 19:54.600
WHY DID YOU DO THE SURGERY ONCE
YOU SAW THE CANCER HAD SPREAD?

19:54.633 --> 19:56.667
GEORGE...

19:56.700 --> 19:59.700
HE ASKED YOU, RIGHT?

19:59.733 --> 20:03.067
HE ASKED YOU TO DO IT
NO MATTER WHAT?

20:03.100 --> 20:06.433
WE HAVE TO HONOR
OUR PATIENT'S WISHES.

20:11.233 --> 20:14.700
YOU SAID YOU WOULD
BE STRAIGHT WITH ME.

20:14.733 --> 20:18.033
HE--HE COULD'VE LIVED
FOR WEEKS...

20:18.067 --> 20:21.433
OR... OR MONTHS.

20:21.467 --> 20:23.800
WE COULD'VE HAD MONTHS
WITH HIM.

20:23.833 --> 20:26.400
MY MOM--SHE COULD'VE HAD
MONTHS WITH HIM!

20:26.433 --> 20:28.333
(Richard) HE WANTED TO FIGHT
THE CANCER, GEORGE.

20:28.367 --> 20:31.167
IT WAS HIS CHOICE.
HE DIDN'T KNOW ANY BETTER!

20:33.333 --> 20:35.800
YOU KNEW BETTER!

20:37.467 --> 20:39.767
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT.

20:42.333 --> 20:44.300
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT!

21:00.733 --> 21:03.800
(coughs)

21:03.833 --> 21:04.800
OH, MY GOD.

21:04.833 --> 21:06.367
LOOK AT YOU.

21:06.400 --> 21:08.067
(nasally voice)
I'M MISERABLE.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.533
IT'S THE RAIN...

21:10.567 --> 21:13.300
THE CONSTANT DAMPNESS
IN THE AIR.

21:13.333 --> 21:15.300
IT TAKES THE BODY A WHILE
TO ADJUST.

21:15.333 --> 21:17.233
I DON'T WANT TO ADJUST.

21:17.267 --> 21:19.567
THEN GO HOME.

21:21.200 --> 21:22.800
IF YOU'D HAD THE BABY,

21:22.833 --> 21:25.300
WE'D BE TOGETHER
IN NEW YORK RIGHT NOW.

21:25.333 --> 21:26.667
IT WOULDN'T BE RAINING,

21:26.700 --> 21:28.600
AND EVEN IF IT WAS,
WE WOULDN'T CARE

21:28.633 --> 21:31.067
BECAUSE WE'D BE TOGETHER.

21:31.100 --> 21:33.233
WE'D BE TOGETHER,
AND I'D HAVE A FAMILY

21:33.267 --> 21:34.733
INSTEAD OF WALKING PNEUMONIA

21:34.767 --> 21:36.667
AND AN EX-BEST FRIEND
WHO HATES ME.

21:36.700 --> 21:38.600
YOU DIDN'T WANT TO RAISE
A CHILD, MARK.

21:38.633 --> 21:41.067
YOU WANTED TO TRUMP DEREK.
YOU WANTED TO WIN.

21:41.100 --> 21:44.233
DON'T MAKE THIS MY FAULT.
YOU DIDN'T WANT A BABY.

21:44.267 --> 21:47.333
NO, I DID WANT A BABY, MARK.

21:47.367 --> 21:50.200
THAT LAST WOMAN YOU SLEPT WITH
BEFORE I LEFT NEW YORK--

21:50.233 --> 21:52.133
CHARLENE, THE PEDS NURSE?

21:52.167 --> 21:56.467
I--DID YOU THINK THAT SHE WAS
THE ONLY ONE I KNEW ABOUT?

21:56.500 --> 21:58.733
YOU'RE REWRITING HISTORY,
MARK.

21:58.767 --> 22:02.600
WE WOULDN'T STILL BE TOGETHER.
WE WEREN'T A GREAT COUPLE.

22:02.633 --> 22:05.133
AND YOU WOULD'VE MADE...

22:05.167 --> 22:09.500
A TERRIBLE FATHER, MARK.

22:09.533 --> 22:11.400
I DID WANT A BABY.
I DID.

22:11.433 --> 22:13.200
I JUST...

22:13.233 --> 22:15.533
I JUST DIDN'T WANT ONE
WITH YOU.

22:23.333 --> 22:26.233
***

22:39.533 --> 22:43.500
***

22:49.600 --> 22:50.700
(woman) WHAT?

22:50.733 --> 22:53.167
IS THAT HIS LUNCH? I'VE BEEN
LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR THAT.

22:53.200 --> 22:55.100
OH, NO. HE CAN'T HAVE THAT.
WHAT?

22:55.133 --> 22:57.667
HE'S, UH, RESTRICTED
FROM FOOD.
NO, HE'S NOT.

22:57.700 --> 23:00.367
NO, I'M HIS DOCTOR.
YOU ARE NOT.

23:00.400 --> 23:02.133
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
HOW HE IS.

23:02.167 --> 23:04.100
AND WITHHOLDING FOOD
GETS HER THAT HOW?

23:04.133 --> 23:05.833
FINE.

23:05.867 --> 23:09.733
FEED HIM. WHATEVER.

23:09.767 --> 23:12.533
YOU WANT ME TO CALL SECURITY?

23:12.567 --> 23:15.467
***

23:27.567 --> 23:29.467
HEY.

23:29.500 --> 23:31.133
HEY.

23:31.167 --> 23:33.600
HAVEN'T SEEN YOU
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

23:33.633 --> 23:35.533
YEAH, I WAS COVERING THE PIT,

23:35.567 --> 23:39.067
AND, UH, I GOT PULLED INTO
AN EMERGENCY APPY

23:39.067 --> 23:41.067
AND A RUPTURED SPLEEN.

23:41.067 --> 23:43.733
IT'S BEEN PRETTY CHAOTIC.

23:43.767 --> 23:45.667
LOOK, KAREV,
I'M YOUR ATTENDING.

23:45.700 --> 23:48.067
I'M SORRY
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.133
IT'S BEEN A...

23:50.167 --> 23:51.500
A WEIRD WEEK FOR ME.

23:51.533 --> 23:55.767
UM... SO I NORMALLY...

23:55.800 --> 23:59.500
ANYWAY, I APOLOGIZE.

24:00.633 --> 24:03.667
THE BABY'S, UH, BOWELS
FUNCTIONING YET?

24:03.700 --> 24:05.600
UH, YEAH, ACTUALLY, UM...

24:05.633 --> 24:08.400
SHE HAD HER FIRST
DIAPER CHANGE TODAY, SO...

24:08.433 --> 24:10.100
THAT'S GOOD.

24:10.133 --> 24:12.433
YEAH, IT IS.

24:12.467 --> 24:15.367
***

24:34.500 --> 24:38.400
THAT NEIGHBOR KID,
MIKE WILDEN?

24:38.433 --> 24:41.733
I DID HIT HIM IN THE FACE
WITH A STICK.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.600
AND... WHEN HIS DAD
CAME OVER

24:46.633 --> 24:48.667
AND HE WAS YELLING AND...

24:48.700 --> 24:52.433
AND--AND YOU ASKED ME
IF IT WAS TRUE...

24:54.200 --> 24:56.133
I LIED.

24:57.467 --> 25:00.300
AND YOU THOUGHT
I NEVER LIED

25:00.333 --> 25:03.667
SO YOU TOOK MY SIDE.

25:03.700 --> 25:06.567
AND YOU AND HIS DAD
GOT IN THAT BIG FIGHT,

25:06.600 --> 25:08.767
AND THEN HIS KIDS
EGGED OUR HOUSE

25:08.800 --> 25:13.467
AND THEN RONNIE AND JERRY
WENT OVER AND...

25:13.500 --> 25:14.833
BLEW UP HIS LAWN MOWER.

25:14.867 --> 25:17.500
ANYWAY...

25:17.533 --> 25:19.500
I DID IT.

25:21.167 --> 25:23.200
HE WAS TEASING ME...

25:23.233 --> 25:26.633
AND HE WAS BIGGER THAN ME...

25:26.667 --> 25:30.533
SO I NEEDED THE STICK
TO REACH HIS FACE.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.333
AND I LIED TO YOU, DAD.

25:40.567 --> 25:42.667
SO...

25:44.433 --> 25:47.067
I'M SAYING I'M SORRY.

25:50.233 --> 25:52.767
DAD...

25:56.667 --> 25:59.533
IF YOU HAVE ANY MORE FIGHT
IN YOU...

26:01.333 --> 26:04.167
IF YOU COULD FIGHT THIS THING
JUST A...

26:04.200 --> 26:07.533
JUST A LITTLE HARDER,
THAT WOULD BE GOOD.

26:10.100 --> 26:12.700
THAT'D BE GOOD RIGHT NOW.

26:26.700 --> 26:27.433
(clock ticking)

26:27.467 --> 26:29.133
WHERE'S DEREK?

26:29.167 --> 26:31.067
HE SLEPT AT HIS PLACE.

26:31.067 --> 26:31.833
(laughs)

26:31.867 --> 26:33.100
(sighs)

26:33.133 --> 26:35.600
DO I REALLY SNORE?

26:35.633 --> 26:37.533
WELL, I GREW UP
NEXT TO A FREEWAY,

26:37.567 --> 26:39.800
SO IT DOESN'T REALLY BOTHER ME,
BUT, YEAH, YOU DO.

26:39.833 --> 26:40.633
(sighs)

26:40.667 --> 26:43.267
DID YOU GET ANY SLEEP
LAST NIGHT?

26:43.300 --> 26:44.600
NO.

26:44.633 --> 26:48.167
NO, I STAYED UP BAKING
AND CLEANING THE BATHROOM FLOOR

26:48.200 --> 26:50.467
IN CASE GEORGE WANTS
TO LAY DOWN ON IT.

26:53.233 --> 26:55.167
IT'S WEIRD.
I HAVE ALL THIS MONEY.

26:55.200 --> 26:57.800
I... I HAVE ALL THIS MONEY,

26:57.833 --> 26:59.733
AND I WOULD SPEND
EVERY PENNY OF IT

26:59.767 --> 27:02.633
TO SAVE GEORGE FROM WHAT HE'S
ABOUT TO GO THROUGH,

27:02.667 --> 27:04.400
BUT I... CAN'T.

27:04.433 --> 27:06.600
IT'S USELESS.

27:06.633 --> 27:08.633
SO I MADE COBBLER.

27:08.667 --> 27:12.200
WELL, COBBLER'S GOOD.

27:12.233 --> 27:14.233
YEAH.

27:32.633 --> 27:35.333
SHE TOLD YOU.

27:35.367 --> 27:37.733
UH...

27:37.767 --> 27:39.633
YEAH.

27:44.067 --> 27:46.367
YOU THINK I'D BE
A TERRIBLE FATHER?

27:46.400 --> 27:47.733
OH, I DON'T--
I DON'T--

27:47.767 --> 27:49.633
ARE YOU...

27:49.667 --> 27:52.533
OKAY, DO YOU LIKE KIDS?

27:52.567 --> 27:54.333
I DON'T KNOW.

27:54.367 --> 27:56.333
DEPENDS ON
HOW LOUD THEY ARE.

27:56.367 --> 27:57.767
OKAY.

27:57.800 --> 27:59.700
DO YOU LIKE YOUR FAMILY?

27:59.733 --> 28:01.700
I MEAN, ARE YOU
A FAMILY KIND OF GUY?

28:01.733 --> 28:03.633
I DON'T REALLY HAVE
A FAMILY.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.700
DEREK...
WAS MY FAMILY.

28:06.733 --> 28:08.533
OKAY.

28:08.567 --> 28:11.667
WELL, WHAT ABOUT, UH,
BIRTHDAYS AND ANNIVERSARIES?

28:11.700 --> 28:13.600
DO YOU REMEMBER
THOSE SORTS OF THINGS?

28:13.633 --> 28:16.567
NO. I DON'T KNOW.

28:16.600 --> 28:18.133
SOMETIMES.

28:18.167 --> 28:19.367
HMM.

28:19.400 --> 28:21.533
ISN'T IT THE SAME WITH--
WITH ALL MEN?

28:21.567 --> 28:23.433
NO.
SOME MEN JUST LIKE KIDS.

28:23.467 --> 28:27.233
TO, UH, TO SOME MEN,
FAMILY IS EVERYTHING.

28:27.267 --> 28:29.800
RIGHT.

28:29.833 --> 28:32.067
AND YOU KNOW THESE MEN?

28:32.067 --> 28:33.800
I DO. (laughs)

28:33.833 --> 28:35.767
I KNOW ONE.

28:43.567 --> 28:46.700
I WOULD'VE MADE
A TERRIBLE FATHER.

28:51.733 --> 28:54.800
(Louise) YOU'RE SAYING...

28:54.833 --> 28:56.733
YOU'RE SAYING
IT'S NOT GETTING BETTER.

28:56.767 --> 29:00.167
YOU'RE SAYING
HE'S NOT GONNA WAKE UP.

29:00.200 --> 29:02.500
MRS. O'MALLEY...

29:02.533 --> 29:05.467
ALL OF HIS ORGANS
ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

29:05.500 --> 29:09.233
HIS LIVER AND HIS KIDNEYS
ARE NO LONGER SUPPORTING HIM,

29:09.267 --> 29:13.200
AND HE IS ENTIRELY DEPENDANT
UPON HIS LIFE SUPPORT MACHINES.

29:13.233 --> 29:15.700
WE'RE SAYING
HE'S NOT GOING TO WAKE UP.

29:15.733 --> 29:20.267
YOU CAN KEEP HIM
ON LIFE SUPPORT

29:20.300 --> 29:22.667
AND WAIT FOR NATURE
TO TAKE ITS COURSE.

29:22.700 --> 29:26.067
THAT COULD TAKE DAYS
OR WEEKS.

29:26.100 --> 29:28.500
OR YOU CAN...

29:28.533 --> 29:31.067
TAKE HIM OFF LIFE SUPPORT.

29:31.100 --> 29:34.167
UNPLUG HIM?

29:34.200 --> 29:37.067
YES, MA'AM.

YEAH?

29:43.067 --> 29:45.800
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

29:50.200 --> 29:52.233
DAD'S IN PAIN.

29:52.267 --> 29:54.333
HIS ORGANS ARE SHUTTING DOWN.

29:54.367 --> 29:56.233
HE CAN'T BREATHE ON HIS OWN.

29:56.267 --> 29:59.067
IT'S PAINFUL.

29:59.100 --> 30:02.433
AND HE'S ON MEDICATION,
BUT...

30:02.467 --> 30:07.367
MEDICATION CAN ONLY DO
SO MUCH.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.400
YOU THINK...

30:10.433 --> 30:13.200
YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK
IT'S TIME...

30:15.367 --> 30:18.367
TO LET HIM GO?

30:23.067 --> 30:26.833
***

30:26.867 --> 30:31.700
WE CAN'T TELL YOU
WHAT TO DO HERE, GEORGE.

30:31.733 --> 30:35.533
***

30:43.167 --> 30:45.633
HE'S NOT DAD LIKE THIS.

30:48.733 --> 30:51.833
AND HE'S NOT
GONNA WAKE UP, MOM.

30:51.867 --> 30:55.433

I'M SORRY, WHAT?

31:36.500 --> 31:38.567
I JUST...

31:38.600 --> 31:39.767
WANTED TO KNOW.

31:41.733 --> 31:43.633
OF THE STORY
OF WHY YOU LEFT.

31:43.667 --> 31:47.267
AND I WAS JUST WONDERING
IF MAYBE YOU HAVE A SIDE

31:47.300 --> 31:49.067
THAT I HAVEN'T HEARD.

31:53.867 --> 31:58.667

AND, UH...

31:58.700 --> 32:00.833
I WANTED TO...

32:00.867 --> 32:03.333
BUT SHE TOLD ME NOT...

32:03.367 --> 32:07.100
TO CALL OR COME AROUND,
AND, UH...

32:07.133 --> 32:10.467
SHE--SHE WAS, UH, UM...

32:13.833 --> 32:16.700
EVENTUALLY, I REMARRIED.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.833
I'M...

WHAT?

32:31.233 --> 32:33.300
IT APPEARS THAT I SNORE.

32:33.333 --> 32:36.700
MY MOTHER NEVER DID,
SO I WAS JUST...

32:36.733 --> 32:38.200
FORGET IT.

32:38.233 --> 32:41.467
I SNORE.

32:41.500 --> 32:45.400
I SNORE LIKE A TRUCKER.
