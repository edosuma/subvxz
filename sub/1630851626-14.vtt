00:02.524 --> 00:04.134
Hey. I brought you
something to snack on.

00:04.178 --> 00:05.527
Oh, thank you, dear.

00:05.570 --> 00:07.659
Could I ask another favor?Mm-hmm.

00:07.703 --> 00:10.140
My sister will be here any
minute to have lunch with me.

00:10.184 --> 00:11.141
Oh, how nice.

00:11.185 --> 00:12.838
Yeah, definitely.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.058
When she gets here,
could you tell her I died?

00:15.102 --> 00:16.320
What?

00:16.364 --> 00:17.539
You don't want to see her?

00:17.582 --> 00:20.194
No. She's rude, foul-tempered

00:20.237 --> 00:22.718
and has a mouth on her
you wouldn't believe.

00:22.761 --> 00:24.894
So she's you?

00:25.895 --> 00:27.244
Without the charm.

00:28.245 --> 00:30.856
Norma, you have a guest.

00:30.900 --> 00:32.032
Ah, thank you, Gabby.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.859
Gabby?

00:33.903 --> 00:35.687
With a voice like that,
your name should be SpongeBob.

00:35.731 --> 00:37.080
I know, right?

00:39.909 --> 00:41.519
Hello, Irene.

00:41.563 --> 00:42.868
Hello, Norma.

00:42.912 --> 00:44.392
My big sister.

00:44.435 --> 00:48.178
Now my little sister,
due to osteoporosis.

00:48.222 --> 00:50.093
Yes, I have gotten
a little shorter,

00:50.137 --> 00:53.053
and you've gotten
a little wider.

00:53.096 --> 00:55.359
Family reunion. Yay.

00:55.403 --> 00:56.404
[chuckles]

00:56.447 --> 00:57.927
Hi, I'm Gina.

00:57.970 --> 01:00.190
Gina owns the place.

01:00.234 --> 01:02.366
You own a retirement home?

01:02.410 --> 01:05.065
What, you couldn't
buy a cemetery?

01:05.108 --> 01:08.590
I find it very rewarding
helping people.

01:08.633 --> 01:10.070
Oh, you're a do-gooder.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.984
What are you,
from California?

01:12.942 --> 01:14.378
No, um, I'm from...

01:14.422 --> 01:16.380
Just let it go.

01:16.424 --> 01:18.252
Oh, hello, ladies.

01:18.295 --> 01:21.429
Hey, Drew, come on over
and-and meet Norma's sister.

01:21.472 --> 01:23.387
The woman preys on weakness.

01:23.431 --> 01:25.128
You're gonna introduce her
to him?

01:25.172 --> 01:27.217
Uh, this is Irene.

01:27.261 --> 01:28.566
Drew drives our shuttle van.

01:28.610 --> 01:29.785
Oh, only temporarily.

01:29.828 --> 01:31.395
I'm a therapist by trade,

01:31.439 --> 01:32.788
but I'm on a sabbatical
while I go on a journey

01:32.831 --> 01:34.398
of self-discovery. [chuckles][chuckles]

01:34.442 --> 01:37.227
You sound like a guy
who's living in his car.

01:37.271 --> 01:39.099
It's a van, actually. So...

01:39.142 --> 01:40.926
You ever try not being rude?

01:40.970 --> 01:42.624
I call it like I see it.

01:42.667 --> 01:45.757
And rude? You didn't even come
to my husband's funeral.

01:45.801 --> 01:47.455
Why the hell would I do that?

01:47.498 --> 01:50.762
Because he was my husband,
and you're my sister.

01:50.806 --> 01:53.417
Well, don't expect to see me
at your funeral, either.

01:53.461 --> 01:55.158
Oh, you're gonna outlive me?

01:55.202 --> 01:58.248
Let's play connect-the-dots
with your melanoma.

01:58.292 --> 01:59.249
[Norma scoffs]

01:59.293 --> 02:00.250
How's your diabetes?

02:00.294 --> 02:01.599
Still got both feet?

02:01.643 --> 02:04.036
I only need one
to kick your ass.

Oh, you have a little dog hair
on your derrière.

03:23.551 --> 03:26.031
Rhyme unintentional,

Oh.

Well, get it for me.

03:27.424 --> 03:29.034
Really?
Mm.

Oh.

03:39.567 --> 03:40.698
And good.

03:40.742 --> 03:41.873
[chuckles] You're spotless.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.048
You could eat off that thing.

03:43.092 --> 03:44.528
Not soup, obviously,

03:44.572 --> 03:46.226
but certainly a sandwich
or a finger food.

03:46.269 --> 03:47.879
[chuckles] Thanks, buddy.

03:47.923 --> 03:49.229
Ooh.

03:49.272 --> 03:50.752
I did not know
I was into that.

03:51.753 --> 03:53.363
Good morning to you, Harry.Yeah.

03:53.407 --> 03:55.365
What's the deal with you two?

03:55.409 --> 03:57.889
Oh, nothing, just getting rid
of some dog hair on her behind.

03:57.933 --> 03:59.717
She did give me a kidney.

03:59.761 --> 04:01.719
Well, this is against
my better judgment,

04:01.763 --> 04:03.982
but I'd like to see you happy.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.725
You have any interest
in meeting my grandniece?

04:07.769 --> 04:10.380
You want me to be a part
of your family.

but then who doesn't?

04:20.129 --> 04:22.392
I demand-a to meet Amanda.

MAN [on TV]:
No matter how clever he is,
he still needs...

04:29.312 --> 04:31.575
Tomorrow night, I was thinking
we could get sushi.

04:31.619 --> 04:34.099
Sure, if it's
on the Applebee's menu.

04:34.143 --> 04:35.405
Mm.

04:35.449 --> 04:37.929
And then maybe after,
you could, uh...

04:37.973 --> 04:39.931
spend the night.

04:39.975 --> 04:41.803
You mean like a sleepover?

04:42.804 --> 04:44.414
Well, I know you wanted
to take it slow,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.937
but things have been good,
right?

04:45.981 --> 04:48.418
Uh, things got a little bumpy

04:48.462 --> 04:51.160
when you made me binge
"Downtown Abbey,"

04:51.203 --> 04:53.423
but otherwise, yeah, good.

Mm.

we can get crazy.

Oh, don't be scared.

Just a few toys.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.001
Great.

05:06.044 --> 05:07.611
So if you have a good time,

05:07.655 --> 05:10.310
I won't know if it
was me or the slinky.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.445
Wh-- Oh, Peter, my God.
What happened?
Oh.

05:15.489 --> 05:18.622
I believe the technical term
is "I fell on my ass."

05:18.666 --> 05:20.798
Oh. Are you okay?

05:20.842 --> 05:22.974
I slipped in the shower
and injured my coccyx.

Oh.

05:24.019 --> 05:25.847
Let the snickering begin.

I'll bring you
an ice pack later.[sighs]

with a swollen coccyx.

lunch and dinner,

Nice to meet you.

Okay, let's go sit over there.Mm.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.194
Far, far away from other people.

06:09.238 --> 06:12.372
Uh, for the record,
if you and I were a couple,

06:12.415 --> 06:14.678
I'd be proud
to be with you.

06:14.722 --> 06:16.724
Thank you.

06:17.768 --> 06:19.509
This place isn't half bad.

06:19.553 --> 06:22.556

and an application to move in.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.209
Oh, hell no.

06:24.253 --> 06:26.386
Why not?
Since Stanley died,

06:26.429 --> 06:28.562
there's nothing for me
in Florida anymore.

06:28.605 --> 06:30.085
Course there is.

06:30.128 --> 06:32.870
There's hurricanes
and alligators.

06:32.914 --> 06:36.439
I'm at the age where
assisted living makes sense.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.920
Wouldn't mind some help
getting off the can.

06:39.921 --> 06:42.053
This is my home,

06:42.097 --> 06:44.099

let you ruin it for me.

causes or was it a choice?

07:03.771 --> 07:05.599
What's up?Yeah. Hey, um...

07:05.642 --> 07:08.428
Any chance someone else could
drive the van tomorrow night?

07:08.471 --> 07:10.081
I've got a bit of a sitch.

07:10.125 --> 07:11.735
Oh, I'm sure we could
figure out something.

07:11.779 --> 07:13.128
What's your sitch?

07:13.171 --> 07:14.608
Well, it's not really a sitch.

07:14.651 --> 07:16.436
It's more of a thang.

07:16.479 --> 07:17.741
Ooh, a thang.

07:17.785 --> 07:19.917
You gonna get some spice
where it's nice?

07:19.961 --> 07:23.268
It's just a blind date,
but phasers are set to fun.

07:28.535 --> 07:30.754
Harry set me up
with his niece, Amanda.Ooh.

07:30.798 --> 07:32.277
Amanda.

07:32.321 --> 07:34.323
And what do we know
about Amanda?

07:34.366 --> 07:37.587
Not much, but it seems as if
I've piqued your curiosity.

07:37.631 --> 07:38.806
It's not piqued.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.503
You've piqued nothing.

07:40.547 --> 07:41.635
Oh, it's piqued.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.334
Like my wife
is always yelling at me,

07:45.377 --> 07:46.770
"Flush!"

07:46.814 --> 07:48.468
[groaning]

07:48.511 --> 07:50.121

07:54.865 --> 07:56.171
Can I ask you a question?

07:56.214 --> 07:57.781
I mean, like, confidential?

07:57.825 --> 07:59.827
Your secret is safe with us.

07:59.870 --> 08:01.785
Mostly because
we won't remember it.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.613
SPENCER:
Listen, I-I...

08:03.657 --> 08:06.616
I've been out of the dating
scene for a long time.

08:06.660 --> 08:09.358
What's the story
with those pills, you know,

08:09.401 --> 08:12.840
for your little engine
that sometimes can't?

08:14.406 --> 08:15.973
You talking about boner pills?

08:16.017 --> 08:17.801
I got a trunk full of 'em.

08:17.845 --> 08:20.369
You want me to crush some up
in your "pasghetti" tonight?

08:20.412 --> 08:22.632
It's not like I need 'em, I...

08:22.676 --> 08:23.807
Take 'em.

08:23.851 --> 08:24.808
Really, I don't have a problem.

08:24.852 --> 08:25.809
Take 'em.

08:25.853 --> 08:26.810
But I'm not even sure, I...

08:26.854 --> 08:28.812
Take 'em.Fine.

08:28.856 --> 08:30.335
I'll take 'em.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.556
It's just that
I haven't been with a woman

08:33.600 --> 08:35.036
since Jackie passed.

08:35.079 --> 08:36.167
So you're nervous?

08:36.211 --> 08:37.821
Damn right I am.

08:37.865 --> 08:40.824
I can't help feeling like
maybe I'm betraying her.

08:40.868 --> 08:42.173
Mm.
Mm.

08:42.217 --> 08:43.827
After my wife passed,

08:43.871 --> 08:46.526
it was several years
before I was even interested

08:46.569 --> 08:48.005
in talking to another woman.

08:48.049 --> 08:50.355
Oh, yeah.
Meredith was it for me.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.531
Oh, yeah.

08:51.574 --> 08:52.532
HARRY:
Besides, I'm 85.

08:52.575 --> 08:54.185
I'm done talking,

08:54.229 --> 08:55.230
and more importantly,
I'm done listening.

08:55.273 --> 08:56.666
[laughs]

08:56.710 --> 08:58.363
I know divorce isn't death,

08:58.407 --> 09:00.670
but, uh, I had trouble
moving on, too--

09:00.714 --> 09:03.543
until I saw
my ex's dating profile.

09:03.586 --> 09:06.894
Single one month,
now you love hiking, Paula?

09:08.069 --> 09:09.853
I lost my first wife,

09:09.897 --> 09:12.247
but I felt like
finding love again

09:12.290 --> 09:15.598
and living life to the fullest
was actually honoring her.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.209
I had no idea your wife died.

09:18.253 --> 09:19.559
I'm so sorry.

09:19.602 --> 09:22.083
No, I lost her
at a Super Kmart.

09:23.084 --> 09:25.042
She said she was going
for Q-tips,

09:25.086 --> 09:26.566
and I never saw her again.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.090
But I know you're
watching over me, Coco.

09:30.961 --> 09:33.877
I-I think what
he's trying to say is

09:33.921 --> 09:37.446
that Jackie would be happy
you found Bette.JERRY: Yeah.

09:39.274 --> 09:41.406
I think she would.

09:41.450 --> 09:43.408
Thanks, fellas.

09:43.452 --> 09:45.062
Bette's a special lady,

09:45.106 --> 09:47.761
a-and I want to show her
by banging her good.

09:50.938 --> 09:52.243
[knock on door]

09:52.287 --> 09:53.723
Come in.

09:53.767 --> 09:55.595
Hey, how's it going?

09:55.638 --> 09:57.640
I didn't see you at dinner.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.425
That's 'cause the food
gets in the way of the booze.Oh.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.950
Irene is definitely a handful.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.735
A handful?
Don't you mean a bitch?

10:05.779 --> 10:09.434
I don't like it when women
use that word for other women...

10:09.478 --> 10:12.133
but yeah, total bitch.

10:12.176 --> 10:14.091
My whole life,

10:14.135 --> 10:16.616
everything I had,
she had to have, too.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.011
When I got a doll, she'd cry
until she got the same one.

10:22.143 --> 10:23.797
I permed my hair in high school.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.972
So did she.

10:25.015 --> 10:26.756
Thankfully her hair fell out.

10:26.800 --> 10:29.933
Yeah, but that's
normal sister stuff.

10:29.977 --> 10:33.154
Like, when my sister got a bag
of weed, I wanted one, too.

10:35.156 --> 10:37.114
Did your sister
steal your first love?

10:37.158 --> 10:41.162
Well, weed was my first love.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.296
She really
stole your boyfriend?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.777
The date was May 11, 1958.

10:47.821 --> 10:50.040
I guess I'm sitting
for this one.

10:51.346 --> 10:53.653
I'd been seeing Stanley
for a while.

10:53.696 --> 10:56.786
He was handsome, funny...

10:56.830 --> 10:59.136
I was madly in love with him.

10:59.180 --> 11:00.964
[sucks teeth]

11:01.008 --> 11:03.314
Then Irene walks in wearing one
of her tight sweaters

11:03.358 --> 11:05.665
and asks him
to fix her flat tire.

11:06.578 --> 11:09.190
Six months later,
I was at their wedding.

11:10.191 --> 11:11.975
I got so drunk,

11:12.019 --> 11:15.065
I wound up fooling around
with my second cousin, Larry.

11:16.023 --> 11:19.679
Coat closet, Cousin Dwight,
been there.

11:21.724 --> 11:24.379
So you understand
why I can't have her live here.

11:24.422 --> 11:26.033
Totally.

11:26.076 --> 11:28.513
I know what it's like
to have a sister who...

11:28.557 --> 11:31.168
Don't you dare
make this about you.

11:31.212 --> 11:32.822
But I have an awful sister, too.

11:32.866 --> 11:33.867
[groans]

11:40.047 --> 11:42.005
[knock on door]One second.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.051
I'm old, time is precious.

11:44.094 --> 11:46.009
Here's my application
to move in.

11:46.053 --> 11:49.012
For emergency contact,
I put Tom Selleck.

11:49.056 --> 11:51.885
I don't know him, but I'd like
to meet him before I die.

11:51.928 --> 11:54.714
[chuckles softly]
Yeah, about that...

11:54.757 --> 11:57.412
We actually have no vacancies.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.022
I see.

11:59.066 --> 12:01.024
Like little baby Jesus,
no room at the inn.

12:01.068 --> 12:03.374
Yes. Exactly.

12:03.418 --> 12:06.726
And it has nothing to do with
my sister not wanting me here?

12:06.769 --> 12:08.728
Right again.You're a terrible liar.

12:08.771 --> 12:11.078
Mm, I know.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.863
She poisoned you against me.

12:13.907 --> 12:16.083
Oh, she did tell me
about Stanley.

12:16.126 --> 12:17.737
You want to hear my side?

12:17.780 --> 12:18.738
Not really.

12:20.043 --> 12:23.046
They'd been going out for a bit,
nothing serious,

12:23.090 --> 12:25.745
and then one day, Stanley
showed up before Norma got home,

12:25.788 --> 12:27.398
and we started talking.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.879
And it was like, bam,
instant connection.

12:29.923 --> 12:31.446
Still, she's your sister.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.753
Yeah, and he was my soul mate.

12:33.796 --> 12:36.886
We were together for 57 years.

12:36.930 --> 12:38.758
[sighs]

12:38.801 --> 12:41.804
See, that's why I didn't
want to hear this.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.068
And she met her Arthur
a year later.

12:45.112 --> 12:47.114
They had a wonderful life
together.

12:47.157 --> 12:51.248
Well, as wonderful as
life can be with Norma.

12:51.292 --> 12:52.467
[smacks lips]

12:52.510 --> 12:54.121
It's interesting.

12:54.164 --> 12:57.428
I have a terrible relationship
with my sister.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.648
Don't make this about you.

13:01.650 --> 13:04.131
You know,
I've never dated a therapist

13:04.174 --> 13:05.915
that wasn't my therapist.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.787
This was right after
my ex-husband

13:07.830 --> 13:10.485
dropped the assault and battery
charges against me.

13:11.486 --> 13:14.271
Are we sleeping together
tonight?

13:14.315 --> 13:16.926
Um, you know, I hadn't
given it much thought.

13:16.970 --> 13:18.798
I'm asking 'cause
I'm waiting on some lab results,

13:18.841 --> 13:20.800
and I can only do hand stuff.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.803
That's very thoughtful.

13:23.846 --> 13:26.283
My Uncle Harry said
really nice things about you.

13:26.327 --> 13:27.937
Did he? Oh.
Mm-hmm.

13:27.981 --> 13:29.983
Funny, he didn't say
nearly enough about you.

13:30.026 --> 13:31.811
[chuckles][chuckles]

13:33.987 --> 13:36.337
Welcome to my humble abode.

13:40.515 --> 13:42.473
Well, I figured
there'd be leopard print,

13:42.517 --> 13:45.737
but you got the
entire endangered species list.

13:46.738 --> 13:48.740
[sexy jazz starts playing]

13:56.009 --> 13:56.966
Mm.

13:57.010 --> 13:59.490
Oh, right to it, huh?

13:59.534 --> 14:02.667
You know, at our age,
we really ought to stretch.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.191
I'd hate to pull something.

14:05.192 --> 14:07.977
Let me do the pulling. Mm.

14:08.021 --> 14:10.023
[both moaning]

14:12.764 --> 14:16.029
Whoa. Your floor plan's got
the bathroom and the window

14:16.072 --> 14:18.858
on the right.
Mine's just the opposite.

14:18.901 --> 14:21.338
Are you sure
you're ready for this?

14:21.382 --> 14:23.384
Oh, yeah. Totally.

14:24.385 --> 14:27.518
I'm just worried
I'm gonna disappoint you.

14:27.562 --> 14:31.348
Oh. That's very sweet, but
there's nothing to worry about.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.872
Thanks.

14:32.915 --> 14:35.744
I just don't really
know where to start.

14:40.444 --> 14:43.534
Whoa, those are nice.

14:43.578 --> 14:44.535
Mm-hmm.

14:44.579 --> 14:46.233
I'd applaud, but...

14:46.276 --> 14:48.888
I don't want
to take my hands off.

14:48.931 --> 14:52.630
Should we get into bed?

14:54.067 --> 14:55.764
I go where they go.

14:57.418 --> 14:59.594
I asked you both
here because

14:59.637 --> 15:01.552
we should be able
to work this out like adults...

15:01.596 --> 15:02.902
No.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.033
I understand you're upset,
but...

15:04.077 --> 15:05.252
No.

15:06.601 --> 15:08.385
I told you she couldn't
be mature about this.

15:08.429 --> 15:11.736
She's not just a child in size.

15:11.780 --> 15:14.217
It's hard to believe
you don't have any friends

15:14.261 --> 15:16.263
keeping you in Florida.

15:16.306 --> 15:17.917
Typical Norma.
You've got a good thing,

15:17.960 --> 15:19.744
and you don't want to share it.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.051
Why would I share it when
you're gonna take it anyway?

15:22.095 --> 15:23.923
I didn't take Stanley!

15:23.966 --> 15:26.055
Oh, you're gonna lie to my face?

15:26.099 --> 15:28.405
Your original face or this one?

15:28.449 --> 15:30.407
Okay, let's keep it civil.

15:30.451 --> 15:31.974
Everybody knows
how it went.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.411
There's a reason
they called you Easy Irene.

15:34.455 --> 15:36.936
And there's a reason
nobody called you at all.

15:36.979 --> 15:40.417
Stanley was mine, and
that's why you wanted him.[scoffs] Yeah,

15:40.461 --> 15:42.593
I stayed with him for 57 years

15:42.637 --> 15:44.291
just to annoy you.NORMA:
See?

15:44.334 --> 15:46.423
All we do is fight.
Why the hell would you want

15:46.467 --> 15:47.947
to live here anyway?Because you're my sister

15:47.990 --> 15:50.123
and you're all I have left.

15:52.995 --> 15:54.779
My husband's gone.

15:54.823 --> 15:57.957
I'm lucky
if I see my kids twice a year.

15:58.000 --> 16:00.829
I hate my grandchildren.

16:03.005 --> 16:04.659
If I don't have you,

16:04.702 --> 16:06.966
I've got nothing.

16:08.010 --> 16:10.839
You're my big sister,
and I love you.

16:18.064 --> 16:20.675
Okay, you can live here.

16:21.676 --> 16:23.460
Really?

16:23.504 --> 16:24.984
I'm willing to see
where this goes.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.638
But if you do anything
to piss me off,

16:27.682 --> 16:28.988
then you're out.

16:29.031 --> 16:30.293
I've seen the men here.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.513
We're not gonna have
any problems.

16:37.692 --> 16:40.042
[voice breaking]: I only wish
that my sister and I could...

16:40.086 --> 16:42.523
BOTH:
This is not about you.

16:44.090 --> 16:47.049
[panting][panting]
Wow.

16:47.093 --> 16:49.660
Sorry I yelled "touchdown"
at the end.

16:49.704 --> 16:52.011
It's been a while.

16:52.054 --> 16:54.013
I didn't mind.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.015
It was incredible.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.190
Really?Mmm.

16:57.233 --> 16:58.495
The best I ever had.

16:58.539 --> 17:00.149
Oh, wow, that's something

17:00.193 --> 17:02.325
coming from a woman
who's done...

17:02.369 --> 17:04.675
From someone
who's been around the...

17:04.719 --> 17:06.373
Thanks.

17:07.374 --> 17:09.202
How was it for you?

17:09.245 --> 17:10.899
It was nice.

17:10.942 --> 17:13.206
"Nice"?Yeah.

17:13.249 --> 17:16.687
"Nice" is a grilled cheese
sandwich on a cold, rainy day.

17:16.731 --> 17:18.733
Well, it was
our first time.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.083
We got to get in a groove.

17:21.127 --> 17:22.693
Well, then let's try again.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.043
What, now?Yeah.

17:24.086 --> 17:25.914
Are you crazy?Yeah.

17:27.394 --> 17:29.570
Is everyone okay? Oh, my God.

17:31.224 --> 17:33.052
You pressed
your emergency call button?

17:34.401 --> 17:36.925
Oh. Our bad.GIDEON:
Mm.

17:36.968 --> 17:40.102
That's gonna haunt me.

17:51.983 --> 17:53.246
DREW:
Gina?

17:55.596 --> 17:58.207
Hi, Drew.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.556
What are you doing?

17:59.600 --> 18:02.559
What are youdoing?

18:02.603 --> 18:04.387
Would you like to come in?

18:04.431 --> 18:05.780
Oh, no. No.

18:05.823 --> 18:08.913
Uh, I don't want to
interrupt your date.

18:08.957 --> 18:10.567
Oh, I took my date home.

18:10.611 --> 18:12.265
Really?

18:13.266 --> 18:16.225
It's pretty early.Yeah, well,

18:16.269 --> 18:17.748
she wasn't exactly my type.

18:17.792 --> 18:19.141
Hmm. What type was she?

18:19.185 --> 18:20.316
Clinically insane.

18:21.317 --> 18:22.927
Why? Are you still piqued?

18:22.971 --> 18:25.669
I'm not piqued.
I was never piqued.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.282
Gina,

18:29.325 --> 18:31.414
how long are we gonna do this?

18:31.458 --> 18:32.676
Do what?

18:33.677 --> 18:35.114
I love you.

18:35.157 --> 18:37.246
You have to know that.

18:37.290 --> 18:40.423
And I think you feel something,
too. Otherwise,

18:40.467 --> 18:42.121
you wouldn't be creeping around
trying to get a glimpse

18:42.164 --> 18:43.818
at the psychopath
I just took to dinner.

18:43.861 --> 18:45.124
[chuckles softly]

18:47.822 --> 18:51.260
Ah, the long pause
after I tell a woman I love her.

18:51.304 --> 18:53.480
Reminds me of my marriage.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.615
It's complicated. I just...

18:58.659 --> 19:00.008
I need more time.

19:01.009 --> 19:02.489
Course you do.

19:03.490 --> 19:05.796
Sorry I'm not following
your schedule.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.191
Whatever. Take all
the time you want.

19:14.196 --> 19:17.330
It might not have been clear,
but that was me storming out.

19:27.340 --> 19:28.993
Good morning.Good morning.

19:29.037 --> 19:30.821
I smell sex.

19:30.865 --> 19:32.519
Yeah, you do.

19:34.042 --> 19:37.045
I'm with her.
But I see you looking.

19:38.264 --> 19:41.484
If I'm looking at one of you,
it's her.

19:41.528 --> 19:43.530
Hey, how's it going?

19:43.573 --> 19:44.705
You all settled in?

19:44.748 --> 19:45.880
Yes, I am.

19:45.923 --> 19:47.490
Uh, hey, while I got you here,

19:47.534 --> 19:49.492
who do I see
about getting some nice towels?

19:49.536 --> 19:51.059
Uh, well,

19:51.102 --> 19:54.323
I guess you'd see
Bed Bath & Beyond. [chuckles]

19:54.367 --> 19:57.892
With what you're charging me,
that crap isn't gratis?

19:57.935 --> 20:01.200
Well, we're not a hotel per se.

20:01.243 --> 20:03.550
Listen to you. "Per se."

20:04.899 --> 20:07.336
All right.
Here's a hundred bucks.

20:07.380 --> 20:10.209
Go run out, get me some towels.GINA:Uh...

20:10.252 --> 20:12.515
Well... Uh...

20:12.559 --> 20:14.517
You wanted this.

20:14.561 --> 20:17.041
Okay. Any particular color?

20:17.085 --> 20:18.739
Nah, I'm easy.

20:20.436 --> 20:22.569
Why are you
still standing there?

20:26.094 --> 20:28.401
What are you smiling about?

20:28.444 --> 20:31.882
I'm just thinking about
how that son of a bitch Stanley

20:31.926 --> 20:34.755
got 57 years of you.
