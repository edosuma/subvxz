09:11.348 --> 09:13.150
- HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
GETTING THESE GIRLS OUT

09:13.183 --> 09:14.851
WITHOUT
SHUTTING SULLA DOWN?

09:14.885 --> 09:17.254
- HOW?
- BUY THEM. ALL OF THEM.

09:17.287 --> 09:18.589
HE'S TAKEN YOUR MONEY ONCE.
HE'LL DO IT AGAIN.

09:18.622 --> 09:20.424
- THAT'LL COST
OVER A MILLION DOLLARS

09:20.457 --> 09:23.360
- 1.5 MILLION.

09:23.360 --> 09:24.895
- 1.5 MILLION, HUH?

09:24.895 --> 09:27.764
- I FILLED OUT THE REQUISITION.
IT JUST NEEDS YOUR SIGNATURE.

09:27.764 --> 09:31.535
FILE IT WITHIN THE HOUR,
OR I'M GONNA HURT YOU.

09:34.605 --> 09:36.273
- SEX SLAVES.

09:36.306 --> 09:38.642
- SO IF THE TUNNELS WORK,

09:38.675 --> 09:41.778
HOW DO WE SELL IT
TO PAPA SOLANO IN MEXICO?

09:41.812 --> 09:43.814
- JOHNNY'S OUR WAY IN.
- HE LOST CARLITO.

09:43.847 --> 09:45.782
- WE STILL GOT THE GIRL.
- LUCIA?

09:45.782 --> 09:47.517
- MM-HMM.
- SHE'S NOT ABOUT THAT LIFE.

09:47.517 --> 09:50.454
- SHE'S A SOLANO. HE COULD USE
HER TO GET TO THE FATHER.

09:50.487 --> 09:53.457
- DO YOU THINK HE'S IN ANY
POSITION TO TALK HER INTO IT?

09:53.490 --> 09:54.858
- CALL HIM AND FIND OUT.

09:54.891 --> 09:56.360
[numbers beeping]

09:57.928 --> 10:01.798
[shower running,
cell phone buzzing]

10:01.832 --> 10:03.367
- YOU COLD?
- NO.

10:03.400 --> 10:05.168
- YOU SURE?
- MM-HMM.

10:05.202 --> 10:09.239
- MM. I SWEAR YOU DO THINGS
TO ME, BABE.

10:18.282 --> 10:21.385
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:21.385 --> 10:23.854
- MY FATHER WANTS ME HOME
WITH HIM IN MEJICO.

10:23.887 --> 10:26.290
- TELL HIM
YOU'RE SAFE WITH ME.

10:26.290 --> 10:27.824
- HE WON'T LISTEN, JOHNNY.

10:27.824 --> 10:29.493
- ALL RIGHT,
FORGET YOUR DAD, THEN.

10:29.526 --> 10:31.828
- NO.
- I'LL KEEP YOU HIDDEN.

10:31.862 --> 10:33.730
- YOU KNOW CARLITO,

10:33.764 --> 10:37.634
BUT MY FATHER...
IT'S ALWAYS DEATH.

10:37.668 --> 10:41.305
- OKAY.
- DEATH AND BLOOD AND I'M DONE.

10:41.338 --> 10:42.673
DONE WITH MEJICO.
- ALL RIGHT. OKAY.

10:42.673 --> 10:44.775
- I DON'T WANT TO GO.
- OKAY. OKAY, OKAY.

10:44.808 --> 10:47.644
SO NO MEXICO, THEN.

10:47.678 --> 10:51.448
ME AND YOU...
WE'LL FIGURE IT OUT, RIGHT?

10:51.481 --> 10:53.817
I GOT YOU.

11:05.495 --> 11:08.865
LUCIA SAYS SHE'S NOT GONNA
GO TO MEXICO.

11:08.899 --> 11:11.168
SHE WON'T DO IT.
SHE JUST TOLD ME.

11:11.168 --> 11:13.337
- CAN YOU CHANGE HER MIND?
- NO.

11:13.370 --> 11:14.838
SHE'S TRYING
TO CUT TIES, MAN.

11:14.838 --> 11:16.707
SHE WANTS TO GET AWAY
FROM THAT LIFE--LET HER DO IT.

11:16.707 --> 11:18.775
- THAT'S NOT THE QUESTION,
JOHNNY.

11:18.809 --> 11:22.779
CAN YOU CHANGE HER MIND?

11:22.813 --> 11:24.214
- NO.

11:24.247 --> 11:26.316
SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE ALONE
WITH THAT FAMILY.

11:26.350 --> 11:28.752
- YOU'LL BE WITH HER.

11:28.785 --> 11:30.320
- I'M SORRY, WHAT NOW?

11:30.320 --> 11:32.723
- YOUR RELATIONSHIP WITH LUCIA
AND CARLITO IS READY-MADE

11:32.723 --> 11:34.257
FOR AN INTRODUCTION
WITH THEIR FATHER.

11:34.291 --> 11:35.425
- IT'S NOT READY-MADE
FOR NOTHING.

11:35.459 --> 11:36.727
I'M JUST SOME DUDE
THEY KNOW.

11:36.727 --> 11:38.628
- HEY,
YOU'RE THE BEST WE GOT.

11:38.662 --> 11:40.597
- THANKS.

11:40.630 --> 11:42.599
- OKAY, LOOK.

11:42.632 --> 11:44.201
YOU JUST GET 'EM
TO BUY OUR IDEA

11:44.234 --> 11:45.869
TOWARDS REESTABLISHING
THEIR SHIPMENTS NORTH.

11:45.902 --> 11:47.237
- DO WE HAVE A METHOD?
- WE'RE LOOKIN'

11:47.270 --> 11:49.339
TO CO-OP THE DRUG TUNNEL
INVESTIGATION

11:49.339 --> 11:50.507
AND THEN TAKE IT OVER.

11:50.540 --> 11:51.875
- YOU WANT ME
TO SELL THAT TO THEM?

11:51.875 --> 11:53.810
- YEAH.

11:53.844 --> 11:56.813
- [sighs]

11:56.847 --> 11:59.416
YOU CARE. I GET IT.

11:59.449 --> 12:01.718
BUT THERE'S
NO INNOCENTS HERE.

12:01.752 --> 12:03.487
THEY NEED TO BUY
OUR METHOD

12:03.487 --> 12:07.491
BEFORE THEY FIGURE OUT
THEIR OWN.

12:07.491 --> 12:09.393
I NEED
AN EXPENSIVE WATCH.

12:09.426 --> 12:11.161
- PHONE ROOM,
TOP RIGHT DRAWER.

12:13.597 --> 12:15.866
- LOOK, MAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
I CAN'T DO IT.

12:15.866 --> 12:19.703
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO DO IT TO HER.

12:27.611 --> 12:29.646
- LUCIA STILL
AT YOUR MOM'S?

12:29.646 --> 12:32.516
OH, THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

12:34.885 --> 12:36.286
YOU SLEEP WITH HER, JOHNNY?

12:36.319 --> 12:39.256
- I LOOK STUPID TO YOU?
DON'T ANSWER THAT.

12:39.256 --> 12:41.258
- SHE'S A CARTEL CONNECTED
SUBJECT

12:41.258 --> 12:42.692
OF A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION.

12:42.726 --> 12:44.928
- SHE KIND OF STOPPED
BEIN' A SUBJECT A WHILE AGO.

12:45.162 --> 12:46.263
- SO YOU HAD TO GO
AND SCREW HER?

12:46.263 --> 12:47.431
- YEAH, I DID.
SO WHAT?

12:47.464 --> 12:49.499
- SO WHAT?
BEST-CASE SCENARIO,

12:49.499 --> 12:51.301
YOU'RE ON THE STAND
SENDING HER FATHER

12:51.334 --> 12:52.836
AND HER BROTHER
TO THE GAS CHAMBER--BEST CASE.

12:52.869 --> 12:54.838
AND SHE'S WATCHING YOU.

12:54.871 --> 12:57.374
- DON'T TELL ME THE WORST THEN.
- YOU BLEW YOUR COVER.

12:57.407 --> 12:59.443
- NO.

12:59.476 --> 13:01.912
THIS STAYS BETWEEN YOU
AND ME.

13:05.482 --> 13:07.250
- WHAT'D I MISS?
- HUH?

13:07.284 --> 13:08.285
- NOTHIN'.
- TALKIN'.

13:08.318 --> 13:09.686
- I'M GONNA
GO SEE SULLA.

13:09.719 --> 13:11.455
OH,

13:11.488 --> 13:13.657
I FIGURED OUT HOW TO GET LUCIA
MOVIN' TO MEXICO

13:13.690 --> 13:15.826
WITH YOU AT HER SIDE.
- HOW IS THAT?

13:15.859 --> 13:19.696
- I'M GONNA MAKE HER A PERSON OF
INTEREST IN A TRIPLE HOMICIDE.

13:25.669 --> 13:27.137
- ACCORDING TO BASCO,

13:27.170 --> 13:29.873
THE GUNS ARE IN A CLOSET
IN THIS CORNER OF THE HOUSE.

13:29.906 --> 13:32.776
RECON HAS LOOKOUTS HERE
AND HERE.

13:32.809 --> 13:34.578
WE'RE GONNA WAIT FOR HODGES
TO BREACH,

13:34.611 --> 13:37.848
AND THEN WE ARE ALL GOING IN
FRONT AND BACK.

13:37.881 --> 13:39.916
- HOW MANY GUNS?
[phone buzzing]

13:40.150 --> 13:43.587
- 20 TO 30
ACCORDING TO MR. FINN THERE.

13:43.620 --> 13:46.223
- HOW MANY TRIGGER FINGERS?
[phone buzzing]

13:46.256 --> 13:47.657
- PAUL?
- UH, YEAH.

13:47.691 --> 13:48.825
I'M SORRY, GUYS.
I GOT--I GOT TO TAKE THIS.

13:48.825 --> 13:50.760
- HEY, WEST,
WE'RE NOT FINISHED HERE.

13:50.794 --> 13:53.196
- THE LOOKOUTS HAVE THEIR
THUMBS ON SPEED-DIAL...

13:53.196 --> 13:56.166
- KELLY? KELLY, YOU THERE?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

13:56.199 --> 14:00.337
- I CAN'T LIVE
WITHOUT HIM.

14:00.370 --> 14:02.172
- WHERE ARE YOU?

14:03.707 --> 14:04.875
- I'M SAYING GOOD-BYE.

14:04.908 --> 14:06.843
- KELLY, LISTEN TO ME
VERY CAREFULLY.

14:06.843 --> 14:09.513
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME
WHERE YOU ARE, HUH?

14:11.214 --> 14:12.282
- I'M WITH JUAN.

14:12.315 --> 14:15.452
I BOUGHT HIM A HEADSTONE.

14:42.437 --> 14:44.672
- JESUS CHRIST.

14:45.740 --> 14:48.510
KELLY.
KELLY.

14:48.543 --> 14:50.612
SWEETHEART.

14:50.645 --> 14:52.514
KELLY,
WHAT DID YOU TAKE, HUH?

14:52.547 --> 14:54.716
HUH? WHAT ARE THESE?

14:54.716 --> 14:57.452
ALL RIGHT.
KELLY, SIT UP FOR A SECOND.

14:57.485 --> 15:00.255
SIT UP, SWEETIE. SIT UP. SIT UP.
SIT UP. SIT UP. SHH. IT'S OKAY.

15:00.288 --> 15:02.657
IT'S OKAY. IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY. SHH.

15:02.690 --> 15:05.460
HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
HEY. WHERE'S MAIA, HUH?

15:05.493 --> 15:07.762
KELLY. KELLY, WHERE'S MAIA?
WHERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

15:07.795 --> 15:11.165
- MOM. MY MOM.
- SHE'S WITH YOUR MOTHER? OKAY.

15:13.201 --> 15:14.636
I NEED YOU TO STAND UP,
SWEETIE.

15:14.669 --> 15:17.305
- I'M HERE WITH HIM,
WHERE HE SHOULD BE.

15:17.338 --> 15:18.873
- KELLY, I'M SORRY, BABY,

15:18.873 --> 15:22.810
BUT I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET YOU
TO A HOSPITAL.

15:22.844 --> 15:26.347
- THEY'LL TAKE MAIA AWAY
FROM ME.

15:30.351 --> 15:32.453
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY. STAY
AWAKE. STAY AWAKE. STAY AWAKE.

15:32.487 --> 15:34.322
COME HERE. EASY.

15:34.355 --> 15:37.258
JUST LEAN ON ME. LEAN ON ME.
LEAN ON ME. RIGHT HERE.

15:37.292 --> 15:39.494
WE'RE GOING THIS WAY, OKAY?
I GOT YOU.

15:39.527 --> 15:41.462
[whispering] TAKE IT EASY.
WE'RE JUST GOIN' THERE.

15:57.312 --> 15:59.280
- WHEN YOU GAVE ME
A PLACE TO MEET,

15:59.314 --> 16:01.249
I WAS EXPECTING
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

16:01.249 --> 16:03.184
- I WANT
TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING.

16:03.217 --> 16:06.354
IT'S THE REASON
WE'RE HERE.

16:06.387 --> 16:08.089
- [chuckles]

16:08.089 --> 16:09.524
I THOUGHT WE WERE HERE
TO NEGOTIATE.

16:09.557 --> 16:11.759
- NEGOTIATE?
- YEAH.

16:11.759 --> 16:13.561
- I TOLD YOU
ON THE TELEPHONE, NO.

16:13.595 --> 16:14.762
I'M NOT SELLING
THE GIRLS.

16:14.762 --> 16:17.632
YOU INSISTED.
- HMM.

16:17.632 --> 16:21.135
- YOU WANT MORE?
HERE'S MORE.

16:39.520 --> 16:42.590
HE'S MY KID BROTHER.
HE'S A VEGETABLE.

16:47.261 --> 16:49.263
- WHAT HAPPENED?

16:49.263 --> 16:51.599
- MY EMPLOYER BEAT HIM WITH
THE BUTT OF AN ANTIQUE RIFLE.

16:51.633 --> 16:55.470
- WHAT'D HE DO?
- NOTHING.

16:55.503 --> 16:59.474
JUST A PRODUCT
OF MY DISOBEDIENCE.

16:59.507 --> 17:02.810
- YOUR BOSS BEAT HIM
TO REMIND YOU WHO'S IN CHARGE?

17:02.810 --> 17:06.814
- MY BOSS BEAT HIM
FOR FUN.

17:06.814 --> 17:08.149
THIS, THIS PLACE--

17:08.149 --> 17:10.351
THIS IS THE REMINDER.

17:10.385 --> 17:12.286
- AND THIS IS WHY
THERE'S NO SALE.

17:12.286 --> 17:14.489
- NOT FOR LACK OF DESIRE.

17:14.522 --> 17:18.559
YOU SEE, MY BOSS IS HAVING
TROUBLE WITH THE FBI,

17:18.593 --> 17:20.828
DOESN'T WANT TO ATTRACT
ATTENTION.

17:20.862 --> 17:23.364
THE GIRLS GO NOWHERE.

17:23.398 --> 17:27.368
JUST BE A BIT DIFFICULT TO SPEND
YOUR MONEY AS A VEGETABLE.

17:47.855 --> 17:50.158
- THEY WANT ME, JOHNNY.

17:52.427 --> 17:53.828
THERE'S NO GETTING OUT
OF THIS.

17:56.531 --> 17:58.399
- LISTEN--
- WE HAVE TO GO.

17:58.433 --> 17:59.867
WE HAVE TO
GET OUT OF HERE.

18:00.101 --> 18:01.636
WE HAVE TO GET AS FAR AS WE CAN.
- LUCIA.

18:01.669 --> 18:03.471
- OR DO WE STAY AND HIDE?
I CAN CUT MY HAIR--

18:03.471 --> 18:06.674
- MEXICO. IT'S THE SAFEST PLACE
FOR YOU RIGHT NOW.

18:06.708 --> 18:08.743
- JOHNNY, YOU SAID
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO GO BACK.

18:08.776 --> 18:10.878
- I KNOW. I KNOW I DID,

18:11.112 --> 18:14.282
BUT I WAS IN THE HOUSE,
TOO.

18:14.315 --> 18:18.486
THEY PROBABLY ALREADY GOT MY DNA
OR FIBERS OR WHATEVER.

18:18.486 --> 18:20.888
THEY'RE GONNA BLAME
THE MURDER ON US, BABE.

18:20.888 --> 18:23.758
- SO YOU'RE A COWARD.

18:23.791 --> 18:27.428
- NO.

18:27.462 --> 18:29.397
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE YOU.

18:29.430 --> 18:31.232
YOUR FATHER'S PLACE
IS PROTECTED.

18:31.265 --> 18:33.768
MEXICO IS THE BEST PLACE
FOR YOU AND ME.

18:33.801 --> 18:35.670
- IT'S TOO LATE.
- IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

18:35.703 --> 18:37.205
- IT IS.

18:37.205 --> 18:39.474
I CAN'T CROSS THE BORDER
WITH THE LAST NAME "SOLANO."

18:39.474 --> 18:42.443
- I CAN GET US ACROSS.
- HOW?

18:42.477 --> 18:45.346
WE NEED PASSPORTS,
GOOD ONES.

18:45.379 --> 18:46.814
- I GOT PEOPLE.

18:46.848 --> 18:50.184
IF I CAN...

18:53.187 --> 18:56.457
YOU CROSS WITH ME?

18:56.491 --> 18:57.725
- YOU'RE GONNA MAKE ME
DO THIS?

18:57.759 --> 19:00.194
- BABY, JUST--

19:00.228 --> 19:01.362
- STOP.

19:06.701 --> 19:08.636
FINE.

19:16.410 --> 19:18.279
[knock on door]

19:18.312 --> 19:21.449
- YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?
- YEAH, COME IN.

19:23.718 --> 19:25.720
YOU GUYS HAVE
A NEW DELIVERY METHOD?

19:25.753 --> 19:29.323
- WORKIN' ON IT.
- WHAT IS IT?

19:29.357 --> 19:31.526
- TUNNELS.
- NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT.

19:31.526 --> 19:34.428
DRUGS AND GUNS CAN TRAVEL
THROUGH TUNNELS EASILY,

19:34.462 --> 19:35.830
AND SO CAN WOMEN.

19:35.863 --> 19:37.799
MIKE'S NOT GONNA GIVE SOLANO
ANOTHER WAY

19:37.799 --> 19:39.567
TO TRAFFIC THESE GIRLS.
IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.270
WE HAVE TO FIGURE
SOMETHING ELSE OUT.

19:44.472 --> 19:45.840
- ALL RIGHT.

19:45.873 --> 19:48.176
A COUPLE YEARS BACK,

19:48.209 --> 19:51.379
A MAJOR CARTEL
STARTED DROPPIN' CONTRABAND

19:51.412 --> 19:53.748
FROM A BIG CARGO PLANE,
TONS OF STUFF.

19:53.781 --> 19:56.217
THEY DROPPED OFF DRUGS,
GUNS,

19:56.250 --> 19:59.520
EVERYTHING VEGETABLE
AND MINERAL, NEVER ANIMAL.

19:59.554 --> 20:01.789
NO ILLEGALS,
NO HUMAN TRAFFICKING.

20:01.823 --> 20:03.257
- OKAY.

20:03.257 --> 20:04.659
- THEY TIED EVERYTHING
TO THESE BIG PALLETS

20:04.692 --> 20:06.194
AND DROPPED 'EM
OUT THE BACK OF THE PLANE

20:06.227 --> 20:08.162
ATTACHED TO PARACHUTES.

20:08.196 --> 20:10.464
SH--,
I WOULDN'T RISK THE RIDE.

20:10.498 --> 20:13.301
- OKAY, WE GO WITH PLANES.
THE TUNNELS ARE OUT.

20:13.334 --> 20:14.402
- MIKE'S HOT FOR IT.

20:14.435 --> 20:16.304
- NO. NOT AN OPTION.

20:16.337 --> 20:17.705
YOU TELL MIKE
THAT THE TUNNELS ARE OUT.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.240
WE'RE GOIN' WITH PLANES.

20:19.273 --> 20:21.475
- OKAY.

20:21.509 --> 20:24.445
WELL, THEN I GUESS WE GOT TO
FIND OURSELVES A PLANE.

20:24.478 --> 20:25.713
- MM-HMM.

20:29.717 --> 20:31.686
- SIT UP. SIT UP. SIT UP.
SIT UP. SIT UP.

20:31.719 --> 20:33.554
- STOP, I CAN'T.
