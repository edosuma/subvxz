01:01.900 --> 01:04.608
Police found her in the street.
Looks like she was bitten.

01:04.778 --> 01:06.128
Some kind of an animal.

01:06.321 --> 01:08.154
Jesus! Her water’s broken!

01:08.323 --> 01:10.037
She's going into
uterine contractions!

01:10.159 --> 01:12.204
We'll have to do a C-section!

02:10.469 --> 02:11.953
What you got down there,
little man?

02:12.095 --> 02:13.802
Oh, that's my heatseeker.

02:13.902 --> 02:15.356
I'll bet it is.

02:18.602 --> 02:19.893
So, where are we going?

02:20.062 --> 02:21.715
It's a surprise, baby.

02:21.855 --> 02:23.563
Yeah, I like surprises.

02:30.030 --> 02:31.405
Oh, my God!

02:31.823 --> 02:34.528
What the fuck are we doing here?

02:37.210 --> 02:38.575
Look at all that.

02:41.463 --> 02:42.917
What the fuck is that?

02:53.470 --> 02:55.510
What did you just say?

03:34.511 --> 03:35.511
Wow.

03:51.069 --> 03:52.232
What's up?

03:52.654 --> 03:54.196
Man!

04:04.499 --> 04:05.698
All right.

04:30.817 --> 04:32.857
What's happening?

04:39.576 --> 04:41.070
Whoa!

04:41.495 --> 04:42.775
Man.

04:47.751 --> 04:48.949
Fuck.

04:59.972 --> 05:01.632
Fuck. I need a drink.

05:57.404 --> 05:59.278
What's wrong, baby?

06:55.254 --> 06:56.254
Is that him?

06:56.672 --> 06:58.166
Jesus, that's him.

06:58.590 --> 07:01.377
It's Blade. It's the Daywalker.

07:23.240 --> 07:24.520
Come on, Daywalker!

07:45.095 --> 07:47.966
I'm gonna rip
your fucking head off!

08:42.152 --> 08:44.359
That's him! Get him!

08:44.780 --> 08:45.780
Fuck him up!

08:46.073 --> 08:49.157
We're gonna jack you up.
Make him hurt bad.

09:54.433 --> 09:55.678
Quinn...

09:59.021 --> 10:00.861
I'm getting a little tired
of chopping you up.

10:05.402 --> 10:09.234
Thought I might try fire
for a change.

10:11.909 --> 10:14.197
Give my regards to Frost.

10:18.123 --> 10:19.368
Please don't!

10:33.889 --> 10:35.051
Put him out.

10:35.474 --> 10:37.098
- Yes, sir.
- Paramedics.

11:00.165 --> 11:03.415
Got a charred cadaver for you.
Still warm, too.

11:03.835 --> 11:05.495
One, two, three.

11:10.467 --> 11:12.543
Jesus, that's rank.

11:13.637 --> 11:16.093
He was still screaming
when they found him...

11:16.515 --> 11:19.220
stapled to a wall.

11:19.643 --> 11:20.923
That's very pretty.

11:34.533 --> 11:35.693
Did you check the chem count?

11:36.076 --> 11:37.654
Blood sugar's
three times norm...

11:38.078 --> 11:39.831
phosphorus and uric acid
are off the charts.

11:39.931 --> 11:41.740
You took this off a DOA?

11:45.794 --> 11:47.703
But this doesn't make any sense.

11:51.425 --> 11:53.667
The red blood cells are
biconvex, which is impossible.

11:54.094 --> 11:56.134
Look at the polys,
they're binucleated.

12:00.642 --> 12:03.477
Curtis,
it's 3.00 in the morning...

12:03.896 --> 12:04.896
This is not a joke.

12:05.188 --> 12:07.062
I've got the body
in the morgue right now.

12:08.984 --> 12:11.440
I thought you promised
to give me some distance.

12:12.487 --> 12:14.610
I just want you to come down
and take a look.

12:21.079 --> 12:24.413
Show me the body.

12:24.833 --> 12:27.040
And I don’t want to hear
a word about us.

12:27.461 --> 12:30.034
Done.
We've had that conversation.

12:34.176 --> 12:36.056
You haven't started
on the internal organs yet?

12:36.261 --> 12:38.135
Just a blood sample
for the pericardium.

12:40.766 --> 12:43.886
The maxilla
looks a little deformed.

12:44.311 --> 12:46.683
There's some odd muscle
structure around the canines.

12:47.105 --> 12:49.976
I'm going to start the "Y"
and check the tracheal mucosa.

12:55.072 --> 12:56.614
Let me ask you something.

12:58.325 --> 12:59.523
Honestly...

13:01.161 --> 13:02.721
you ever have
second thoughts about us?

13:05.749 --> 13:06.912
Sometimes.

13:09.044 --> 13:11.202
But then I remember
how much of an asshole you were.

13:11.630 --> 13:12.670
Want to cut me some slack?

13:12.965 --> 13:15.456
You asked for time off,
I gave you time off.

13:16.510 --> 13:17.750
- Look, Curtis...
- I'm trying.

13:17.886 --> 13:19.464
It's over.

13:38.448 --> 13:39.729
Call security!

13:56.675 --> 13:58.050
Came back to finish you off.

13:58.468 --> 14:00.508
Get out of my way, you freak!

14:07.477 --> 14:09.102
Freeze!

14:10.814 --> 14:13.601
Motherfucker,
are you out of your damn mind?!

15:06.703 --> 15:08.281
Hey, you! Freeze!

15:27.182 --> 15:28.511
Hold it right there!

15:44.449 --> 15:46.193
My shoulder...

15:46.618 --> 15:48.196
it's dislocated.

17:37.521 --> 17:38.521
Whistler.

17:50.284 --> 17:51.659
Bringing home strays now?

17:53.954 --> 17:55.365
She's been bitten.

17:59.835 --> 18:00.997
Should've killed her, then.

18:01.420 --> 18:03.044
Yeah, I know...

18:05.507 --> 18:07.001
but I didn't.

18:13.807 --> 18:15.800
You watch her close.

18:16.226 --> 18:19.013
If she starts to turn,
you finish her off.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.644
Or I will.

18:32.242 --> 18:33.653
She's borderline.

18:35.287 --> 18:38.122
Another hour,
she'd be well into the change.

18:40.792 --> 18:43.497
Dr. Karen Jenson, listen close.

18:44.630 --> 18:46.622
I'm going to inject you
with allium sativum...

18:47.049 --> 18:48.543
garlic.

18:48.967 --> 18:50.759
This is going to hurt... a lot.

18:51.178 --> 18:52.376
It was Quinn.

18:53.597 --> 18:55.139
Frost's little errand boy?

18:56.433 --> 18:58.011
You get a lead on him?

19:00.270 --> 19:01.729
Too bad.

19:04.441 --> 19:05.472
Hold her.

19:16.787 --> 19:18.411
I give her fifty-fifty...

19:18.830 --> 19:21.119
if she makes it
through the night.

19:47.484 --> 19:48.978
Blade...

19:49.403 --> 19:51.111
the Daywalker...

19:51.530 --> 19:53.772
still pursuing
his ridiculous crusade.

19:57.578 --> 19:58.953
How many died?

20:00.247 --> 20:01.990
We don't have an exact count.

20:02.416 --> 20:04.325
Apparently,
he used a lot of silver.

20:04.751 --> 20:08.334
- We're having difficulty...
- Send in Frost.

20:16.555 --> 20:17.717
Deacon Frost.

20:21.768 --> 20:23.311
You can come in now.

20:58.096 --> 20:59.646
These nightclubs of yours
are dangerous.

20:59.746 --> 21:01.140
Are they?

21:01.558 --> 21:04.014
They draw needless attention
to our kind.

21:04.436 --> 21:05.436
You know our policy.

21:05.687 --> 21:07.479
Your policy, not mine.

21:07.898 --> 21:10.056
Our livelihood...

21:11.276 --> 21:14.277
depends on our ability
to blend in...

21:15.322 --> 21:16.697
and our discretion.

21:17.783 --> 21:20.072
Maybe it's time
we forgot about discretion.

21:21.578 --> 21:23.072
We should be ruling
the humans...

21:23.497 --> 21:26.070
not running around making
back-alley treaties with them.

21:26.500 --> 21:28.220
For fuck's sake,
these people are our food...

21:28.460 --> 21:29.705
not our allies.

21:30.128 --> 21:32.999
- You're out of line.
- Am I?

21:33.423 --> 21:35.257
Or maybe I'm just
the first to say out loud...

21:35.357 --> 21:36.505
what we’ve all been thinking.

21:36.927 --> 21:38.338
We have existed this way...

21:38.762 --> 21:41.170
for thousands of years.

21:41.598 --> 21:45.976
Who are you
to challenge our ways?

21:46.395 --> 21:48.637
You're not even a pureblood.

21:52.067 --> 21:53.347
Like it matters.

21:54.653 --> 21:58.104
I was born a vampire...

21:58.532 --> 22:01.865
as was every other member
of this house...

22:02.286 --> 22:03.531
but, you, Frost...

22:06.915 --> 22:09.489
you were merely turned.

22:11.628 --> 22:15.246
The world belongs to us...
not the humans.

22:16.049 --> 22:17.460
You know that.

22:22.180 --> 22:24.553
Do we have
any other business to discuss?

22:24.975 --> 22:30.182
There's the matter
of our offshore accounts.

22:30.606 --> 22:33.013
And have you made
the transfer to the...

22:33.442 --> 22:36.443
Gitano, you may wake up one day
and find yourself extinct.

23:10.520 --> 23:11.931
You're a week early.

23:20.822 --> 23:23.492
Whistler says I'm building up
a resistance to the serum.

23:26.912 --> 23:29.237
I figured that might happen.

23:38.465 --> 23:40.007
You take care, all right?

25:25.239 --> 25:27.065
I must be getting soft
in my old age...

25:27.491 --> 25:29.733
letting you bring home
a stray like that.

25:31.036 --> 25:33.194
It was damn stupid of you.

25:33.622 --> 25:35.661
Might've lucked out, though.

25:36.917 --> 25:39.325
I checked her background.

25:42.089 --> 25:44.496
It turns out
she's a haematologist.

25:46.093 --> 25:47.966
She might be useful to us.

25:49.555 --> 25:50.965
I doubt it.

25:52.349 --> 25:54.057
I'm serious.

25:54.476 --> 25:56.036
I took a look
at that notebook of hers.

25:56.353 --> 25:58.511
She's onto something.

26:01.108 --> 26:02.732
I had to increase the dose.

26:04.194 --> 26:05.902
It's over 50 milligrams now.

26:06.321 --> 26:07.484
That's getting dangerous.

26:07.906 --> 26:11.489
Just do it... old man.

27:11.470 --> 27:13.795
Wander off the beaten path,
Doctor?

27:15.682 --> 27:17.011
Who are you people?

27:17.434 --> 27:19.012
My name's Abraham Whistler.

27:20.312 --> 27:21.771
You've met Blade.

27:37.871 --> 27:39.828
So, am I a prisoner here?

27:41.416 --> 27:42.959
Not at all.

27:43.377 --> 27:45.029
We just had to take
certain precautions...

27:45.129 --> 27:47.085
before we let you go.

27:47.506 --> 27:50.626
You got to understand,
they're everywhere.

27:51.051 --> 27:52.878
Vampires...

27:53.303 --> 27:54.797
the hominus nocturna.

27:56.139 --> 27:59.057
We hunt them... moving
from one city to the next...

27:59.476 --> 28:00.970
tracking their migrations.

28:01.395 --> 28:04.514
They're hard to kill.
Tend to regenerate.

28:04.940 --> 28:06.420
And I'm supposed
to believe all this?

28:06.567 --> 28:09.437
You already met Mr. Crispy
at the hospital.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.439
What do you think?

28:13.365 --> 28:15.025
So, what do you use, then?

28:15.450 --> 28:16.993
Stakes? Crosses?

28:17.411 --> 28:19.119
Crosses don't do squat.

28:19.538 --> 28:21.863
Some of the legends
are true, though.

28:22.291 --> 28:25.494
Vampires are severely allergic
to silver.

28:25.919 --> 28:29.039
Feed them garlic and they go
into anaphylactic shock.

28:29.464 --> 28:31.184
Then, of course,
there's always sunlight...

28:31.425 --> 28:32.883
ultraviolet rays.

28:33.302 --> 28:35.508
I got this sucker running.

28:35.929 --> 28:37.673
You want to give it a try
tonight?

28:44.563 --> 28:45.678
It's still heavy.

28:47.274 --> 28:48.472
But you're so big.

28:51.195 --> 28:52.755
If you want to live
to see another day...

28:52.855 --> 28:54.174
you'll be out of town
by nightfall.

28:54.573 --> 28:56.566
Where am I supposed to go?

29:00.412 --> 29:02.701
You've been exposed to them.

29:03.123 --> 29:05.910
One way or another, somebody's
going to take you out.

29:10.797 --> 29:12.755
There's a war going on
out there.

29:14.092 --> 29:16.500
Blade, myself, a few others...

29:16.929 --> 29:19.716
we've tried to keep it from
spilling over onto the streets.

29:20.140 --> 29:23.474
Sometimes, people like yourself
get caught in the cross fire.

29:24.853 --> 29:27.012
I have blood samples.
I can go to the police.

29:27.439 --> 29:29.930
They own the police.

29:30.359 --> 29:32.079
You have to understand,
they're everywhere.

29:32.236 --> 29:35.236
Chances are you've seen them
yourself and didn't know it...

29:35.656 --> 29:37.529
on the subway or in a bar.

29:39.618 --> 29:42.287
So that's it?

29:42.704 --> 29:45.575
You guys just patch me up
and send me on my way?

29:49.628 --> 29:50.908
Here.

29:51.338 --> 29:52.749
Vampire mace...

29:54.341 --> 29:56.084
silver nitrate,
essence of garlic.

29:56.510 --> 29:58.799
You keep your eyes open.

29:59.221 --> 30:01.130
Be careful.

30:05.269 --> 30:07.427
One other thing...

30:07.854 --> 30:09.812
buy yourself a gun.

30:11.275 --> 30:13.314
If you start getting
sensitive to daylight...

30:14.611 --> 30:16.403
If you find you're thirsty...

30:16.822 --> 30:19.692
regardless of how much
you had to drink...

30:20.117 --> 30:23.367
then I suggest you take that gun
and use it on yourself.

30:27.040 --> 30:29.448
Better that
than the alternative.

31:27.351 --> 31:29.308
You have been warned before.

31:29.728 --> 31:33.311
These archives are restricted
to the members of the House.

31:36.276 --> 31:37.901
You are wasting your time.

31:38.320 --> 31:39.980
It's a dead language.

31:40.405 --> 31:42.979
The ancient texts
can never be translated.

31:45.369 --> 31:47.445
You wouldn't even
understand them.

31:49.790 --> 31:52.115
Damn it, Frost!
I'm talking to you!

31:56.421 --> 31:58.213
Keep your voice down, Gitano.

32:00.717 --> 32:01.717
We're in a library.

32:02.135 --> 32:03.250
You don't need to shout.

32:04.805 --> 32:06.299
What are you up to?

32:18.485 --> 32:20.525
What are you going to do?

32:25.951 --> 32:27.149
What?

32:32.541 --> 32:34.083
You bore me.

33:09.077 --> 33:10.785
Rememberer what we told you.

33:11.997 --> 33:13.408
You keep your eyes open.

33:13.832 --> 33:15.326
They're everywhere.

33:17.169 --> 33:18.793
But it's daytime!

34:18.522 --> 34:19.850
How you doing?

35:38.310 --> 35:40.018
Hi, there.

35:40.437 --> 35:43.010
I'm sorry. Whoa! Hold on.

35:43.440 --> 35:45.183
Police officer. I'm sorry, OK?

35:45.609 --> 35:48.064
I didn't mean to scare you.
The front door was open.

35:48.487 --> 35:49.458
What are you doing here?

35:49.558 --> 35:52.400
I'm here on a routine check.

35:52.824 --> 35:55.576
Look, I'm Officer Krieger,
42nd precinct.

35:55.994 --> 35:58.865
You're Karen Jenson, right?

36:00.707 --> 36:02.067
Your co-workers
at the hospital...

36:02.376 --> 36:04.534
said that you were kidnapped
last night.

36:06.088 --> 36:07.088
Are you OK?

36:07.506 --> 36:10.756
What happened
to the other doctor I was with?

36:12.469 --> 36:15.174
Curtis Webb? He died.

36:16.557 --> 36:19.178
Don’t worry about that
right now, OK?

36:20.143 --> 36:21.554
Why?

36:21.979 --> 36:24.434
Because you're dead, too, bitch.

36:27.776 --> 36:29.603
Bitch! What is it?

36:32.489 --> 36:33.489
What is this, garlic?

36:33.740 --> 36:35.982
He said it would work
against vampires.

36:36.410 --> 36:37.904
Vampires?

36:38.996 --> 36:41.202
Who said I was a vampire?

36:43.584 --> 36:44.615
Nobody.

36:49.548 --> 36:51.291
He's a familiar...

36:52.175 --> 36:53.835
a vampire wannabe.

36:55.137 --> 36:57.260
If he's loyal enough...

36:57.681 --> 37:00.433
and he proves himself,
maybe his master will turn him.

37:02.603 --> 37:04.642
Wait a minute.
You used me as bait?

37:05.063 --> 37:06.688
Get over it.

37:11.570 --> 37:12.570
Is all that necessary?

37:18.035 --> 37:20.989
That's a glyph...
a vampire cattle brand.

37:21.413 --> 37:24.118
It means that Officer Krieger
is somebody's property.

37:24.541 --> 37:26.607
Another vampire tries
to bleed this little hooker...

37:26.707 --> 37:29.124
then they have to answer
to his owner.

37:33.133 --> 37:35.126
We've been tracking him
for a long time.

37:35.552 --> 37:37.011
All right.

37:37.429 --> 37:38.674
Officer Krieger...

37:39.097 --> 37:41.553
you going to be
a good little bloodhound, huh?

37:41.975 --> 37:43.495
Tell us what your master's
been up to.

37:43.894 --> 37:46.100
Great, now you robbing him.
You going to rob me, too?

37:46.521 --> 37:49.522
How do you think
we fund this organization?

37:49.942 --> 37:52.267
We're not exactly
the March of Dimes.

37:55.447 --> 37:56.858
It's fake.

37:59.868 --> 38:03.202
Looks like our friend here
has been blood running.

38:04.456 --> 38:05.456
Hillbarn Clinic.

38:05.666 --> 38:07.146
I know this place.
It's a blood bank.

38:07.501 --> 38:09.436
Owned by vampires,
and there's one in every city.

38:09.536 --> 38:11.335
And they always deliver.

38:11.755 --> 38:13.130
So, where were you taking it?

38:13.549 --> 38:14.949
I don't know
what you're talking...

38:16.468 --> 38:18.377
Look, take it easy.

38:18.804 --> 38:20.547
I'm only going to ask you
one more time.

38:20.973 --> 38:23.214
Where were you taking it?

38:23.642 --> 38:24.642
Go fuck yourself.

38:25.018 --> 38:26.394
Fuck me? No, you fuck this.

38:44.580 --> 38:46.122
You better wake up.

38:46.540 --> 38:49.327
The world you live in
is just a sugar-coated topping.

38:49.751 --> 38:51.874
There is another world
beneath it...

38:52.296 --> 38:53.296
the real world.

38:53.505 --> 38:57.717
If you want to survive it,
learn to pull the trigger.

39:01.638 --> 39:03.132
Wait a minute.
I'm coming with you.

39:03.557 --> 39:04.719
You're useless.

39:08.979 --> 39:10.639
I have to stick with you.

39:11.064 --> 39:12.984
It's the only way
I'll stay alive long enough...

39:13.442 --> 39:15.102
to find a cure for myself.

39:15.527 --> 39:17.520
There is no cure.

39:27.748 --> 39:29.824
He's not going to come back.

39:30.250 --> 39:31.579
Nobody's that stupid.

39:32.002 --> 39:34.919
When you understand
the nature of a thing...

39:35.339 --> 39:37.130
you know what it's capable of.

39:55.067 --> 39:57.439
It's Krieger. I'm at 16-0-0-9.

39:58.654 --> 39:59.899
Get me through.

40:04.535 --> 40:05.975
I got a delivery
in progress here...

40:06.119 --> 40:07.519
and I just had a run-in
with Blade.

40:13.919 --> 40:16.492
I got to clear out
that clinic on Hillbarn now!

40:37.234 --> 40:39.559
Looks like we hit pay dirt.

40:39.987 --> 40:41.529
That's a vampire mark.

40:41.947 --> 40:44.355
It means there's a safe house
around here somewhere...

40:44.783 --> 40:47.321
a place they can go
with donors coming.

40:47.744 --> 40:49.654
See the valets over there?

40:50.080 --> 40:51.278
They're vampires.

40:51.707 --> 40:53.830
So is the doorman...

40:54.251 --> 40:55.662
and the whore on the corner.

40:57.796 --> 40:58.796
How can you tell?

40:59.006 --> 41:01.247
By the way they move...

41:01.675 --> 41:02.955
the way they smell.

41:06.680 --> 41:08.340
It's like a bad dream.

41:08.765 --> 41:10.805
There are worse things
out tonight than vampires.

41:11.226 --> 41:12.226
Like what?

41:12.519 --> 41:13.894
Like me.

41:15.564 --> 41:17.355
OK, vampire anatomy 101.

41:17.774 --> 41:19.334
Crosses and holy water
don't do dick...

41:19.568 --> 41:21.168
so forget what you've seen
in the movies.

41:21.528 --> 41:23.485
You use
a stake, silver, or sunlight.

41:23.906 --> 41:25.530
You know how to use
one of these?

41:25.949 --> 41:28.523
Nope, but I'll damn sure
learn quick.

41:28.952 --> 41:30.714
The safety's off,
round's already chambered...

41:30.814 --> 41:32.126
silver hollow point
filled with garlic.

41:32.226 --> 41:33.336
You aim for the head
or the heart.

41:33.498 --> 41:35.990
Anything else is your ass.

41:37.586 --> 41:40.503
Do you have an invitation?

42:28.512 --> 42:29.710
Kenji!

42:45.112 --> 42:46.191
Where's the entrance?

42:46.613 --> 42:48.653
I can't tell you that, man.

42:52.327 --> 42:53.644
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

42:53.744 --> 42:55.073
Where's the entrance?

42:55.497 --> 42:57.406
OK.

42:58.417 --> 43:00.409
It's in the freezer.

43:09.636 --> 43:12.554
Come on, man! I told you!
It's in the fridge!

43:23.066 --> 43:24.858
You give Frost
a message from me.

43:25.277 --> 43:27.435
You tell him it's open season
on all suckheads.

44:10.906 --> 44:12.899
Some kind of archive.

44:17.037 --> 44:19.077
This must be where they keep
most of their records.

44:19.498 --> 44:21.289
Isn't this
just a little high-tech?

44:21.708 --> 44:23.784
They've got their claws
into everything...

44:24.211 --> 44:25.835
politics, finance, real estate.

44:26.255 --> 44:28.496
They already own
half of downtown.

44:52.573 --> 44:54.233
Frost throws a good party.

44:54.658 --> 44:57.493
Yeah... but where is he?

45:11.842 --> 45:13.087
Come on, baby.

45:22.561 --> 45:24.968
Don't keep everyone waiting.

45:44.917 --> 45:47.490
Deacon, there's someone here
to see you.

45:51.173 --> 45:52.916
I got to talk to you, Frost.

45:54.384 --> 45:56.176
I'm sorry. I had to come here.

45:56.595 --> 45:58.173
It's a mistake going to Pearl's.

45:58.597 --> 46:00.755
I know that. Dumb fucking me.

46:01.183 --> 46:02.263
I know you're disappointed.

46:02.559 --> 46:03.530
Am I that transparent?

46:03.630 --> 46:06.175
You want to meet him?
I can get you in...

46:06.605 --> 46:08.245
because we're tight.
We're like brothers.

46:08.649 --> 46:09.680
Fuck.

46:10.108 --> 46:11.306
Fuck. Frost.

46:15.364 --> 46:17.204
I've been telling these bitches
all about you.

46:17.616 --> 46:19.696
They've been dying to meet you.
They are so psyched.

46:19.952 --> 46:21.944
Bad ass bitches. They...

46:23.956 --> 46:26.114
Frost, it's about Blade.

46:26.542 --> 46:27.542
He's busy, you know?

46:27.834 --> 46:29.792
Because when he's focused
on business...

46:30.921 --> 46:32.332
Frost, this is important.

46:32.756 --> 46:34.381
Blade was waiting for me...

46:34.800 --> 46:36.839
using the girl as bait.

46:37.261 --> 46:38.621
You were stupid enough
to take it.

46:38.845 --> 46:41.419
Shut up. I didn't know
he was going to be there.

46:41.848 --> 46:44.174
It was a trap, see?
But don’t worry about it.

46:44.601 --> 46:46.677
It's no problem.
We can still get the girl.

47:18.468 --> 47:19.548
Forget the girl.

47:19.970 --> 47:22.461
- I want Blade.
- I know you do.

47:22.890 --> 47:25.677
You hear me, Quinn?
I want him alive.

47:26.101 --> 47:27.216
What?

47:29.980 --> 47:33.100
Wait a minute, man.
You want him alive?

47:36.236 --> 47:37.814
What's that smell?

47:40.699 --> 47:43.783
...image carefully, Frost.

47:44.203 --> 47:48.070
You will need 12 purebloods
to make the ritual work.

47:48.498 --> 47:50.206
Krieger, is that you?

47:50.626 --> 47:52.499
He's here!

47:52.920 --> 47:55.755
This must be Pearl...
the record keeper.

47:58.508 --> 48:01.046
He's going to kill me!
You need me, Frost!

48:02.262 --> 48:03.543
Pearl, you're history.

48:03.972 --> 48:06.463
Have the good grace to die
with some fuckin' dignity.

48:08.310 --> 48:09.888
Ruthless bloodsucker.

48:10.312 --> 48:11.391
Congratulations, Blade.

48:13.023 --> 48:14.383
I hear you've been lookin'
for me.

48:14.733 --> 48:17.141
- I'm flattered.
- It'll pass.

48:19.488 --> 48:20.686
Fuck.

48:23.075 --> 48:24.046
What is that?

48:24.146 --> 48:26.490
That, biscuit boy,
is a U.V. Lamp.

48:26.912 --> 48:29.284
We're gonna play a little game
of 20 Questions.

48:29.706 --> 48:31.082
Depending on how you answer...

48:31.500 --> 48:33.991
you may walk out of here
with a tan.

48:34.419 --> 48:35.419
What's that?

48:35.712 --> 48:39.164
That? It's nothing.
It's routine research.

48:39.591 --> 48:41.833
Actually, it's a video game.

48:52.688 --> 48:53.802
That must've hurt.

48:54.231 --> 48:55.974
It's a fragment,
a piece of the prophecy!

48:56.400 --> 48:57.400
What prophecy?

48:57.693 --> 48:59.187
I'm not really sure.

48:59.611 --> 49:01.687
There are so many out...

49:15.460 --> 49:19.043
And there is nothing you can
do about it, Daywalker!

49:19.464 --> 49:21.208
Is that so?

49:22.467 --> 49:24.045
Well, that's what Frost says.

49:24.469 --> 49:27.221
Then you won't mind me
borrowing this, will you?

49:27.639 --> 49:30.510
If he moves, fry him.

49:33.812 --> 49:34.804
What's in here?

49:34.904 --> 49:37.352
It's a storeroom.
But you're wasting your time.

49:37.774 --> 49:39.434
There's nothing
of importance to anyone.

49:39.860 --> 49:41.817
Then you won't mind
if I take a peek.

50:05.552 --> 50:06.963
He moved.

50:38.502 --> 50:39.961
What is this?

50:41.463 --> 50:44.168
These are the pages
from The Book of Erebus...

50:45.133 --> 50:46.676
the vampire Bible.

50:48.887 --> 50:50.796
It contains everything...

50:52.099 --> 50:53.723
their entire history.

50:55.185 --> 50:57.392
La Magra
must be one of their legends.

51:01.775 --> 51:03.898
Why is Frost so interested
in La Magra?

51:42.983 --> 51:45.854
- Give me your hand.
- ¡Hola, amigo!

51:47.988 --> 51:49.363
Do you remember me?

52:07.883 --> 52:09.081
Give it to him!

52:27.194 --> 52:28.356
Nice one.

52:29.446 --> 52:30.609
Well, well, well.

52:31.490 --> 52:32.490
You took my arm, man.

52:32.908 --> 52:34.450
Remember?

52:34.868 --> 52:36.612
But it's cool.

52:37.788 --> 52:39.116
I got a new one.

52:40.332 --> 52:42.490
Think I'll ever
play piano again?

52:44.253 --> 52:45.913
You can slice him,
you can dice him...

52:46.338 --> 52:47.998
but the Quinn man
just keeps on comin'!

52:48.423 --> 52:49.423
Check it out.

52:49.591 --> 52:51.833
I've got his pigsticker.

52:56.181 --> 52:57.592
You're a fuckup, Crease!

53:03.689 --> 53:06.476
You're just full of surprises,
ain't you, chief?

53:14.950 --> 53:17.523
Stay with me, sweetness...

53:17.953 --> 53:20.361
'cause I'm not finished
with you yet.

53:22.583 --> 53:24.374
Looky here.

53:26.628 --> 53:27.909
Silver.

53:28.338 --> 53:29.583
Nice craftsmanship, huh?

53:30.007 --> 53:31.631
Probably cost you
a pretty penny.

53:32.050 --> 53:36.463
This here is a man
who takes his job...

53:38.640 --> 53:40.680
just a little too seriously,
don't you think?

53:45.606 --> 53:47.148
Come to think of it, Blade...

53:47.566 --> 53:49.357
I owe you one.

53:53.864 --> 53:56.437
Actually, if you want
to get technical...

53:58.076 --> 53:59.452
I owe you two.

54:03.332 --> 54:04.612
What's so funny, bright eyes?

54:07.878 --> 54:09.752
I'm expecting company.

54:25.187 --> 54:27.061
Catch you fuckers at a bad time?

54:27.481 --> 54:28.856
No! No guns!

54:39.159 --> 54:40.570
Fuckin' this way!

54:49.586 --> 54:50.784
Drop the guns!

54:51.213 --> 54:52.213
I need him!

54:52.506 --> 54:54.961
Deac wants Blade alive! Go!

54:59.346 --> 55:00.946
You've been listening in
the whole time?

55:01.306 --> 55:02.306
Keeping radio contact.

55:02.724 --> 55:04.644
Think I'd let him run loose
without a chaperone?

55:13.443 --> 55:15.235
Christ! I'm too old for this.

55:16.530 --> 55:18.736
Somebody get me
a goddamn wheelchair.

55:29.501 --> 55:30.621
He can take care of himself.

55:30.836 --> 55:32.034
Jump!

56:53.585 --> 56:54.585
What are you gonna do?

56:55.712 --> 56:57.123
Oh, my God.

57:12.604 --> 57:13.604
What's wrong?

57:15.691 --> 57:17.600
It's dislocated.

57:19.903 --> 57:21.397
Let me help you.

57:33.041 --> 57:34.041
Let me give you...

57:34.418 --> 57:36.209
No! Get away.

57:52.269 --> 57:53.811
You're one of them, aren't you?

57:58.275 --> 57:59.650
I'm something else.

58:07.326 --> 58:08.903
I found him when he was 13.

58:09.328 --> 58:10.870
He'd been livin'
on the streets...

58:11.288 --> 58:12.830
feedin' off the homeless.

58:14.291 --> 58:16.864
His need for blood
had taken hold at puberty.

58:17.294 --> 58:20.295
I took him for a vampire
at first.

58:21.298 --> 58:22.757
Almost killed him, too.

58:23.967 --> 58:25.960
Then I realized what he was.

58:27.262 --> 58:28.982
Blade's mother
was attacked by a vampire...

58:29.348 --> 58:30.806
while she was pregnant.

58:31.225 --> 58:33.929
She died, but he lived.

58:34.353 --> 58:37.638
Unfortunately, he'd undergone
certain genetic changes.

58:38.065 --> 58:41.647
He can withstand garlic,
silver...

58:42.069 --> 58:43.231
even sunlight...

58:43.654 --> 58:45.362
and he's got their strength.

58:47.366 --> 58:50.320
This time tomorrow,
all his wounds will be healed.

58:52.287 --> 58:54.410
He still ages like a human,
though.

58:54.831 --> 58:57.369
Vampires age slower than us.

58:58.669 --> 59:00.626
Unfortunately...

59:01.046 --> 59:03.086
he also inherited their thirst.

59:04.424 --> 59:07.129
I thought the serum
was supposed to suppress that.

59:07.553 --> 59:09.213
Time's runnin' out.

59:11.348 --> 59:13.305
His body's
startin' to reject it.

59:14.768 --> 59:18.896
So far, all my efforts
to find a cure have failed.

59:23.360 --> 59:25.187
Why do you hunt them?

59:27.489 --> 59:29.612
I had a family once...

59:30.033 --> 59:32.275
a wife and two daughters.

59:34.872 --> 59:37.078
Then a drifter
came callin' one evenin'...

59:37.499 --> 59:40.168
a vampire.

59:40.586 --> 59:42.377
He toyed with 'em first...

59:43.505 --> 59:44.964
tried to make me decide...

59:45.382 --> 59:47.125
which order they’d die in.

59:50.721 --> 59:53.675
We kill as many of 'em
as we can find...

59:54.099 --> 59:55.297
but it's gettin' worse.

59:55.726 --> 59:56.971
Because of Frost.

59:57.394 --> 01:00:00.478
There's somethin' happenin'
in the vampire ranks.

01:00:00.898 --> 01:00:01.898
It's somethin' big...

01:00:02.316 --> 01:00:03.726
and I'd stake my life...

01:00:04.151 --> 01:00:06.724
that son of a bitch
is at the centre of it.

01:00:30.469 --> 01:00:32.260
Whistler told me what happened.

01:00:36.225 --> 01:00:37.802
He told me what you are.

01:00:41.521 --> 01:00:43.313
You don't know me.

01:00:43.732 --> 01:00:45.689
You don't know
anything about me.

01:00:48.987 --> 01:00:51.063
I'm not human.

01:00:53.867 --> 01:00:55.065
You look human to me...

01:00:55.494 --> 01:00:57.985
Humans don't drink blood.

01:00:58.413 --> 01:01:00.453
That was a long time ago.

01:01:02.125 --> 01:01:03.952
Maybe you should let that go.

01:01:06.838 --> 01:01:08.381
I have spent my whole life...

01:01:08.799 --> 01:01:10.957
looking for that thing
that killed my mother.

01:01:12.553 --> 01:01:14.545
It made me what I am.

01:01:18.016 --> 01:01:21.017
And every time I take
one of those monsters out...

01:01:21.436 --> 01:01:23.974
I get a little piece
of that life back...

01:01:24.398 --> 01:01:27.102
so don't you tell me
about forgetting.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.112
He took us by surprise!

01:01:33.407 --> 01:01:35.287
Two of them against
your entire security force?

01:01:35.742 --> 01:01:37.902
Don't put that shit on me,
'cause you were there, too!

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:39.480
I'm sure Deacon will
appreciate...

01:01:39.913 --> 01:01:42.665
...stabbed in the balls for it!
You little skeez!

01:01:43.083 --> 01:01:44.705
Don't see the lifestyle
really suits you.

01:01:44.805 --> 01:01:47.067
I'll put this stump through
that shit-eating grin of yours.

01:01:47.167 --> 01:01:50.497
Face it. You were sloppy.
You got what you deserved.

01:01:55.053 --> 01:01:57.758
Deac, let me take this guy out.
Look what he fuckin' did!

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.181
He took my hand again!

01:01:59.391 --> 01:02:02.178
Listen to me. I want him alive.

01:02:02.603 --> 01:02:05.010
What the fuck are you talk...
You want him alive?

01:02:05.439 --> 01:02:07.559
We've been tryin' to kill
this motherfucker for years.

01:02:07.941 --> 01:02:09.483
Are you
out of your fuckin' mind?

01:02:11.069 --> 01:02:14.154
Big guy, relax.

01:02:14.573 --> 01:02:15.853
Be patient.

01:02:17.451 --> 01:02:19.028
Now, we got a lot to do here.

01:02:20.037 --> 01:02:21.579
I need you, man.

01:02:25.542 --> 01:02:27.416
I need you.

01:03:10.879 --> 01:03:12.457
Morning.

01:03:12.881 --> 01:03:14.459
How you feelin'?

01:03:23.684 --> 01:03:24.882
Look at that.

01:03:29.064 --> 01:03:31.935
Gettin' a little toasty
out here, huh?

01:03:34.278 --> 01:03:37.812
When's the last time you stopped
to appreciate a good sunrise?

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:40.000
Oh, that's right.
You were born a vampire...

01:03:40.158 --> 01:03:42.151
so you never had
the pleasure, have you?

01:03:42.578 --> 01:03:44.985
That's OK. It's all right.

01:03:45.414 --> 01:03:46.659
Least we’re here together.

01:03:47.082 --> 01:03:48.624
Share the moment...

01:03:49.042 --> 01:03:51.082
which means a lot to me
by the way, really.

01:03:51.503 --> 01:03:52.748
I mean that.

01:03:55.215 --> 01:03:57.374
'Cause actually,
when you get to know me...

01:03:57.801 --> 01:03:59.794
I'm a fairly
sentimental type of guy.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:02.343
Bit of an innocent,
you might say.

01:04:05.309 --> 01:04:07.218
Do what you want, Frost.

01:04:08.312 --> 01:04:10.269
Doesn't make any difference.

01:04:11.732 --> 01:04:13.689
You just don't fuckin' get it.

01:04:15.819 --> 01:04:17.179
You're never gonna be
a pureblood.

01:04:17.529 --> 01:04:18.988
Hold him.

01:04:21.533 --> 01:04:23.442
You will never rule us!

01:04:36.340 --> 01:04:38.000
Jesus Christ.

01:04:38.425 --> 01:04:39.588
Have a nice day.

01:04:40.427 --> 01:04:41.427
Sorry, you old dog.

01:04:41.762 --> 01:04:43.522
You just got a little too long
in the tooth.

01:04:45.224 --> 01:04:47.133
What, man? That was funny.

01:04:47.559 --> 01:04:48.840
"Long, tooth." Funny.

01:04:49.269 --> 01:04:51.677
Did I tell you the one about...

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.377
What have you done
with Dragonetti?

01:05:30.477 --> 01:05:32.766
Let's get down to business,
shall we?

01:05:33.188 --> 01:05:35.347
I need 12 volunteers.

01:05:46.827 --> 01:05:48.238
What is this?

01:05:50.038 --> 01:05:51.912
Smells like a vampire
wiped his ass with it.

01:05:52.332 --> 01:05:53.613
I took it from the archives.

01:05:54.042 --> 01:05:55.122
It's written in blood.

01:05:55.544 --> 01:05:57.786
It's from The Book of Erebus.

01:06:03.635 --> 01:06:05.347
I think it's what Frost
has been workin' on.

01:06:05.447 --> 01:06:07.130
It's somethin' about
the Blood God...

01:06:07.556 --> 01:06:08.884
the Spirits of the Twelve.

01:06:09.308 --> 01:06:11.431
I don't know.
I can't make out the rest of it.

01:06:11.852 --> 01:06:13.429
Maybe this'll help.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:15.849
I’ll figure out something.

01:06:17.482 --> 01:06:18.763
So what's all this?

01:06:19.193 --> 01:06:21.399
Took a trip
to the hospital last night...

01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.398
borrowed some equipment.

01:06:23.822 --> 01:06:25.779
For your miracle cure?

01:06:28.368 --> 01:06:29.368
This is E.D.T.A.

01:06:29.703 --> 01:06:30.703
It's an anticoagulant.

01:06:30.913 --> 01:06:33.285
We use it to treat blood clots.

01:06:34.458 --> 01:06:36.139
Now look what happens
when I introduce it...

01:06:36.239 --> 01:06:37.958
onto a sample of vampire blood.

01:06:40.422 --> 01:06:41.964
Take a step back.

01:06:42.382 --> 01:06:44.007
The reaction's energetic.

01:06:53.352 --> 01:06:54.352
Some cure.

01:06:54.519 --> 01:06:57.189
I didn't say E.D.T.A.
Was a cure.

01:06:57.606 --> 01:07:01.686
But maybe you could use it
to explode some vampire heads.

01:07:04.196 --> 01:07:06.983
Wait a minute.
I need a sample of your blood.

01:07:07.407 --> 01:07:08.407
Later.

01:07:08.617 --> 01:07:10.444
Gotta go downtown.

01:07:10.869 --> 01:07:11.869
Need some serum.

01:07:12.162 --> 01:07:13.162
Serum can wait.

01:07:13.539 --> 01:07:15.116
This is important.

01:07:37.187 --> 01:07:38.468
Is he sick?

01:07:38.897 --> 01:07:40.095
Cancer.

01:07:42.693 --> 01:07:44.436
You have a lot of love for him,
don't you?

01:07:45.821 --> 01:07:47.481
We have a good arrangement.

01:07:47.906 --> 01:07:50.658
He makes the weapons.
I use 'em.

01:07:54.496 --> 01:07:56.323
My mother used to say...

01:07:56.748 --> 01:07:59.074
"a cold heart is a dead heart."

01:08:16.643 --> 01:08:18.386
You don't look so good.

01:08:19.688 --> 01:08:20.688
I'm just a little tired.

01:08:20.856 --> 01:08:22.683
You know we've been...

01:08:23.108 --> 01:08:24.483
workin' all night.

01:08:27.446 --> 01:08:29.569
I guess we didn't catch it
in time.

01:08:31.158 --> 01:08:35.156
You got another day...
two at the most.

01:08:39.457 --> 01:08:41.201
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

01:08:41.627 --> 01:08:44.830
You make it sound like
I'm already dead.

01:09:29.341 --> 01:09:31.049
How you doin', chief?

01:09:32.386 --> 01:09:33.417
Easy.

01:09:35.055 --> 01:09:36.535
Wouldn’t want
our little friend here...

01:09:36.635 --> 01:09:39.184
to wind up on the back
of a milk carton, would we?

01:09:42.354 --> 01:09:44.560
It's nice to finally meet you.

01:09:44.982 --> 01:09:46.974
Had my eye on you for years.

01:09:47.401 --> 01:09:48.515
I know all about you...

01:09:48.944 --> 01:09:51.517
your serum, Whistler...
everything.

01:09:51.947 --> 01:09:53.774
Sunblock.

01:09:54.198 --> 01:09:55.907
Hey, it's a start, right?

01:09:56.326 --> 01:09:58.782
The goal, of course,
is to be like you...

01:09:59.204 --> 01:10:00.367
the Daywalker.

01:10:01.957 --> 01:10:03.996
You got the best of both worlds,
don't you?

01:10:05.043 --> 01:10:07.665
All our strengths...
none of our weaknesses.

01:10:08.088 --> 01:10:10.793
Maybe I don't see it that way.

01:10:11.216 --> 01:10:13.886
Oh, so it's back to pretending
we're human again?

01:10:14.303 --> 01:10:17.672
Come on. Spare me
the Uncle Tom routine, OK?

01:10:18.098 --> 01:10:20.885
You can't keep denying
what you are, man.

01:10:21.310 --> 01:10:24.264
You think the humans will ever
accept a half-breed like you?

01:10:24.688 --> 01:10:27.144
They can't.
They're afraid of you.

01:10:28.650 --> 01:10:29.931
And they should be.

01:10:30.360 --> 01:10:31.331
You're an animal.

01:10:31.431 --> 01:10:33.443
You're a fuckin' maniac.

01:10:36.533 --> 01:10:37.533
Look at 'em.

01:10:37.951 --> 01:10:39.908
They're cattle...

01:10:40.329 --> 01:10:41.906
pieces of meat.

01:10:42.331 --> 01:10:45.000
What difference does it make
how their world ends?

01:10:45.417 --> 01:10:49.118
Plague, war, famine.

01:10:49.546 --> 01:10:51.918
Morality
doesn't even enter into it.

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:54.995
We're just a function
of natural selection, man...

01:10:55.095 --> 01:10:57.091
the new race.

01:10:58.597 --> 01:11:01.218
Looks like
your mascara's running.

01:11:08.398 --> 01:11:10.272
I'm offering you a truce.

01:11:10.692 --> 01:11:11.973
I want you with us.

01:11:12.402 --> 01:11:14.395
What do you think, I'm stupid?

01:11:22.996 --> 01:11:24.953
You're familiar
with the Blood God.

01:11:27.793 --> 01:11:29.999
You're nothing to me...

01:11:30.420 --> 01:11:32.994
but another dead vampire.

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:35.961
You're an idiot. You know that?

01:11:36.385 --> 01:11:38.305
I came down here
offering you an easy way out...

01:11:38.637 --> 01:11:40.962
and you spit it right back
in my fuckin' face.

01:11:42.683 --> 01:11:44.509
Careful.

01:11:47.646 --> 01:11:50.137
What do I care?

01:11:50.566 --> 01:11:52.523
They're nothing but cattle...

01:11:52.943 --> 01:11:54.437
just like you said.

01:11:54.862 --> 01:11:58.230
If you wanna take the hard road,
be my guest...

01:11:58.657 --> 01:12:00.497
but I promise you,
by the time this is over...

01:12:00.826 --> 01:12:03.151
you're gonna wish they never
cut you from your mother's...

01:12:38.697 --> 01:12:39.942
Go home.

01:12:43.785 --> 01:12:44.715
It was simple.

01:12:44.815 --> 01:12:46.488
Why do vampires need
to drink blood?

01:12:46.914 --> 01:12:48.874
'Cause their own blood
can't sustain haemoglobin.

01:12:49.291 --> 01:12:51.912
It's a genetic defect,
just like haemolytic anaemia.

01:12:52.336 --> 01:12:54.743
That means that we have
to treat it with gene therapy...

01:12:55.172 --> 01:12:58.173
rewrite the victim's DNA
with a retrovirus.

01:12:58.592 --> 01:13:00.964
They've been using it
on sickle cell anaemia.

01:13:01.386 --> 01:13:02.549
Are you sure that's safe?

01:13:02.971 --> 01:13:06.056
I have no idea,
but I don't have a choice, do I?

01:13:08.477 --> 01:13:10.434
You actually think
this could work?

01:13:10.854 --> 01:13:13.891
On me... yes.

01:13:15.025 --> 01:13:16.733
On Blade, I'm not so sure.

01:13:17.152 --> 01:13:20.319
He didn't contract vampirism
from a bite like I did.

01:13:20.739 --> 01:13:21.937
He was born with it.

01:13:22.366 --> 01:13:24.074
It's part of his DNA.

01:13:24.493 --> 01:13:27.031
I'm sure I can cure
his thirst...

01:13:27.454 --> 01:13:28.652
but it's gonna take time.

01:13:29.081 --> 01:13:31.120
We're out of time.

01:13:31.542 --> 01:13:33.451
You saw what was on that disk.

01:13:38.590 --> 01:13:40.084
Damn.

01:13:42.094 --> 01:13:43.292
Get out of here.

01:14:07.995 --> 01:14:10.320
I said get out of here!

01:14:16.420 --> 01:14:19.705
Nice place.
Took us a while to find it!

01:14:27.931 --> 01:14:29.051
Bite me and get it over with.

01:14:29.391 --> 01:14:30.802
I ain't gonna bite you.

01:14:44.281 --> 01:14:45.479
Do your thing.

01:16:06.530 --> 01:16:08.985
Frost took her.

01:16:16.665 --> 01:16:18.124
Listen to me.

01:16:21.169 --> 01:16:22.368
The disk.

01:16:23.672 --> 01:16:24.870
He decoded it.

01:16:25.299 --> 01:16:28.134
Frost is trying to...

01:16:28.552 --> 01:16:32.051
trigger
a fuckin' vampire apocalypse.

01:16:34.182 --> 01:16:36.175
There's some kind of...

01:16:36.602 --> 01:16:39.768
vampire god
he's trying to resurrect.

01:16:41.356 --> 01:16:42.934
La Magra.

01:16:46.320 --> 01:16:48.063
You're the key.

01:16:49.531 --> 01:16:51.323
He needs your blood...

01:16:55.037 --> 01:16:57.195
the blood of the Daywalker.

01:16:59.791 --> 01:17:02.496
You're the chosen one.

01:17:06.048 --> 01:17:07.328
Listen to me, Blade.

01:17:08.842 --> 01:17:10.420
You can't go after him.

01:17:10.844 --> 01:17:12.125
Bullshit.

01:17:12.554 --> 01:17:14.463
If Frost gets his hands
on you...

01:17:14.890 --> 01:17:17.297
it's all over.

01:17:20.270 --> 01:17:22.393
There'll be armies
of the motherfuckers.

01:17:25.734 --> 01:17:26.897
Shit.

01:17:31.907 --> 01:17:33.449
You're gonna have
to finish me off.

01:17:35.285 --> 01:17:36.827
Don’t want me coming back.

01:17:38.747 --> 01:17:40.656
We can treat the wounds.

01:17:42.334 --> 01:17:43.745
It's too far gone.

01:17:44.169 --> 01:17:46.292
You know that.

01:17:49.633 --> 01:17:52.302
Give me your gun.

01:17:56.431 --> 01:17:59.183
Give me the goddamn gun.

01:18:24.251 --> 01:18:25.251
Now walk away...

01:18:25.627 --> 01:18:27.953
you stupid son of a bitch.

01:18:32.718 --> 01:18:35.173
Walk the fuck away.

01:18:56.158 --> 01:18:57.318
By the time you watch this...

01:18:57.451 --> 01:18:58.851
your friend Whistler
should be dead.

01:18:59.161 --> 01:19:00.655
If it makes any difference
to you...

01:19:01.079 --> 01:19:02.408
he put up quite a fight.

01:19:02.831 --> 01:19:05.500
You can find us
at the Edgewood Towers.

01:20:43.765 --> 01:20:45.888
You seem a bit tense.

01:20:46.310 --> 01:20:47.934
A bit pent-up maybe...

01:20:48.353 --> 01:20:49.931
like you need
to release something.

01:20:51.523 --> 01:20:52.523
You know?

01:20:52.733 --> 01:20:53.733
Blade not...

01:20:54.902 --> 01:20:56.360
givin' it to you maybe?

01:20:56.778 --> 01:20:58.901
I don't know. I just...

01:21:00.282 --> 01:21:02.321
I see such a beautiful woman.

01:21:04.036 --> 01:21:05.316
Great skin.

01:21:08.040 --> 01:21:09.783
I'd like to see you happy,
that's all.

01:21:10.209 --> 01:21:13.412
Is this the part
where you offer to turn me?

01:21:15.005 --> 01:21:17.081
It's either that or a body bag.

01:21:17.507 --> 01:21:20.378
Go ahead. Bite me.

01:21:20.802 --> 01:21:23.424
I'll just cure myself.

01:21:23.847 --> 01:21:26.599
I did it before,
and I can do it again.

01:21:27.017 --> 01:21:28.476
There is no cure, baby.

01:21:28.894 --> 01:21:31.136
There is
if you've been bitten...

01:21:31.563 --> 01:21:33.770
if you were once human.

01:21:39.112 --> 01:21:41.686
How'd you get that scar, Deacon?

01:21:42.115 --> 01:21:44.571
A born vampire has the power
to regenerate from birth.

01:21:44.993 --> 01:21:47.864
You must've gotten scarred
before you were turned.

01:21:48.288 --> 01:21:50.447
Isn't that right?

01:21:50.874 --> 01:21:52.701
Vampires like you
aren't a species.

01:21:53.126 --> 01:21:54.953
You're just infected...

01:21:55.379 --> 01:21:58.000
a virus,
a sexually transmitted disease.

01:21:58.423 --> 01:21:59.743
I'll tell you what we are,
sister.

01:21:59.883 --> 01:22:02.090
We're the top
of the fuckin' food chain.

01:22:02.511 --> 01:22:04.231
The Blood God's coming,
and after tonight...

01:22:04.638 --> 01:22:06.298
you people are fuckin' history.

01:22:07.766 --> 01:22:08.929
He's a hurricane...

01:22:09.351 --> 01:22:11.059
an act of God.

01:22:11.478 --> 01:22:14.396
Anyone caught in his path
will instantly be turned.

01:22:16.316 --> 01:22:17.645
Everyone you've ever known...

01:22:18.068 --> 01:22:20.855
everyone
you've ever fucking loved.

01:22:21.280 --> 01:22:24.565
It won’t matter
who's pureblood and who's not.

01:22:24.992 --> 01:22:27.696
How are you gonna cure
the whole fuckin' world?

01:22:34.418 --> 01:22:36.541
And Blade's blood is the key.

01:22:36.962 --> 01:22:38.586
We got an intruder.

01:23:07.951 --> 01:23:10.151
I don't think you understand.
This dude is fuckin' bad.

01:23:10.287 --> 01:23:11.995
He had 20 guys around him...

01:23:12.414 --> 01:23:13.894
and he's got shit
he throws at you...

01:23:14.291 --> 01:23:15.489
Yeah, the swords.

01:23:15.918 --> 01:23:17.467
Throw it in the air,
catch it underneath.

01:23:17.567 --> 01:23:18.574
Yeah. Shut the fuck up!

01:23:19.004 --> 01:23:20.323
There's no intruder
where we are.

01:23:20.423 --> 01:23:21.881
Look, make it happen, all right?

01:23:22.299 --> 01:23:23.544
It's one guy on foot.

01:23:28.263 --> 01:23:29.923
That's him! Get him!

01:23:49.952 --> 01:23:50.983
Why am I hearing gunfire?

01:23:51.411 --> 01:23:53.737
Did I tell anybody
to start shooting?

01:23:54.164 --> 01:23:55.623
I need him alive.

01:24:00.087 --> 01:24:01.332
Please!

01:24:01.755 --> 01:24:03.000
I just work for them!

01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:06.700
Jesus Christ.
Lock this place down.

01:24:07.094 --> 01:24:08.292
Yes, sir!

01:25:55.577 --> 01:25:57.285
Eric?

01:26:08.298 --> 01:26:10.006
But you died.

01:26:11.301 --> 01:26:13.377
I came back, Eric.

01:26:13.804 --> 01:26:15.132
That very same night...

01:26:16.890 --> 01:26:19.512
when Deacon welcomed me
into his arms.

01:26:36.493 --> 01:26:38.486
Jesus Christ.
I thought you'd be happy.

01:26:40.455 --> 01:26:42.335
You're finally reunited,
and you act like this?

01:26:43.917 --> 01:26:45.874
Blade, give it up. It's over.

01:26:46.295 --> 01:26:48.536
She belongs to me, buddy.

01:26:51.425 --> 01:26:52.587
Don't look so surprised.

01:26:53.010 --> 01:26:54.504
You spent your whole life...

01:26:54.928 --> 01:26:57.336
looking for the vampire
who bit your mother.

01:26:57.764 --> 01:26:59.722
Well, here I am.

01:27:02.603 --> 01:27:05.473
Who would ever guess you'd
survive your mother's death?

01:27:05.898 --> 01:27:06.898
But you did.

01:27:07.274 --> 01:27:08.519
And here we are...

01:27:08.942 --> 01:27:11.267
one big happy fuckin' family.

01:27:22.664 --> 01:27:24.456
I need my serum.

01:27:27.169 --> 01:27:30.372
Maybe when we get outta this,
I'll take your miracle cure.

01:27:30.797 --> 01:27:32.375
There's one catch.

01:27:36.303 --> 01:27:37.927
If it works...

01:27:38.347 --> 01:27:40.802
you'll lose your strength...

01:27:41.225 --> 01:27:43.016
and your ability to regenerate.

01:27:44.144 --> 01:27:46.184
You'll be completely human.

01:28:50.878 --> 01:28:52.420
Glad you could make it.

01:28:52.838 --> 01:28:55.163
Thanks for the shades.

01:28:57.467 --> 01:28:59.045
Our ancestors
called this place...

01:28:59.469 --> 01:29:01.261
the Temple of Eternal Night.

01:29:04.349 --> 01:29:05.844
Nice, isn't it?

01:29:06.268 --> 01:29:08.841
Apparently, these geniuses
forgot it ever existed.

01:29:09.271 --> 01:29:11.643
Fortunately for us...

01:29:12.065 --> 01:29:16.359
I'm what you might call
a student of history.

01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:31.203
Why are we here?

01:29:33.712 --> 01:29:37.247
This temple was built
for one glorious moment...

01:29:37.674 --> 01:29:40.924
this night, for the Blood God.

01:29:49.228 --> 01:29:50.473
Thanks.

01:29:55.692 --> 01:29:57.270
Let's see this sword of yours.

01:30:00.781 --> 01:30:01.943
Well.

01:30:02.366 --> 01:30:03.366
Titanium, right?

01:30:03.534 --> 01:30:05.573
Acid-etched?

01:30:08.372 --> 01:30:10.115
I'll get used
to a weapon like this.

01:30:16.338 --> 01:30:19.754
What? You look surprised.

01:30:20.801 --> 01:30:23.090
I told you, Blade,
I know everything about you.

01:30:24.972 --> 01:30:25.972
Hold out your arm, Quinn.

01:30:26.223 --> 01:30:28.050
Why, man?
They're, like, all better.

01:30:28.475 --> 01:30:30.931
Hold out your arm. Now.

01:30:34.690 --> 01:30:35.888
Deac, l...

01:30:41.113 --> 01:30:42.311
Just kidding.

01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:48.154
He was fuckin' with me.

01:30:51.665 --> 01:30:54.417
He can't hear you, honey.
The thirst has got him now.

01:31:01.133 --> 01:31:02.133
What do we have here?

01:31:02.509 --> 01:31:05.214
The precious serum.

01:31:07.431 --> 01:31:08.911
How long's it been
since you shot up?

01:31:09.057 --> 01:31:11.465
Twelve, thirteen hours maybe?

01:31:11.894 --> 01:31:15.428
I bet you're just dying
for a drink, aren't you?

01:31:17.900 --> 01:31:19.098
What's it feel like?

01:31:21.028 --> 01:31:22.652
Is your blood on fire?

01:31:23.071 --> 01:31:25.147
Try some.

01:31:25.574 --> 01:31:27.863
You might like it.

01:31:28.285 --> 01:31:30.361
Thanks, but I prefer
the real thing.

01:31:31.079 --> 01:31:32.989
In any event...

01:31:33.123 --> 01:31:35.282
I don't think you'll be
needing these anymore.

01:31:42.841 --> 01:31:44.039
It's a shame, you know?

01:31:45.302 --> 01:31:46.782
When I think
of what you've become...

01:31:47.095 --> 01:31:49.384
what you should have become.

01:31:49.806 --> 01:31:51.431
I guess I don't blame you.

01:31:51.850 --> 01:31:53.530
I mean, with everything
that's happened...

01:31:53.644 --> 01:31:56.479
it's the human side of you
that's made you weak.

01:31:56.897 --> 01:31:58.377
You should've listened
to your blood.

01:31:58.690 --> 01:32:00.482
Say what you want...

01:32:00.901 --> 01:32:04.151
but, I promise you,
you'll be dead by dawn.

01:32:08.700 --> 01:32:09.981
Get him outta here.

01:32:14.331 --> 01:32:16.371
Get these fucks downstairs.
Now.

01:32:16.792 --> 01:32:18.619
Come on. Let's go.

01:32:25.092 --> 01:32:27.499
Don’t worry, sweetheart.
We haven’t forgotten about you.

01:32:27.928 --> 01:32:28.928
Oh, no, baby.

01:32:29.096 --> 01:32:31.338
We got something real special
planned for you.

01:32:32.724 --> 01:32:35.262
That surfer boy had a nice ass.
I sucked him dry.

01:32:35.686 --> 01:32:37.096
And you’d figure he'd turn, man.

01:32:37.521 --> 01:32:38.830
Yeah, but he didn't turn,
did he?

01:32:38.930 --> 01:32:40.338
No. He turned into
some kinda zombie.

01:32:40.438 --> 01:32:42.313
It happens sometimes, cutie.

01:32:43.735 --> 01:32:45.146
He was fuckin' tripped out.

01:32:46.154 --> 01:32:47.154
Pathetic.

01:32:47.364 --> 01:32:49.484
These guys are complete scum.
They'll eat anything...

01:32:49.783 --> 01:32:53.484
animals, rodents, corpses,
and sometimes...

01:32:54.872 --> 01:32:56.070
they'll even eat vampires.

01:32:56.498 --> 01:32:57.498
That's a plus.

01:32:57.916 --> 01:32:59.156
And bearing that all in mind...

01:32:59.376 --> 01:33:01.250
I'd like you to meet
an old friend of yours.

01:33:07.384 --> 01:33:08.582
It's too bad.

01:33:09.011 --> 01:33:10.920
I kinda liked her.

01:33:11.346 --> 01:33:12.544
What a waste.

01:33:34.244 --> 01:33:36.201
I don't know
what's happening to me.

01:33:37.372 --> 01:33:38.867
No pulse.

01:33:39.291 --> 01:33:42.577
And, of course, there's
the question of lividity.

01:33:54.723 --> 01:33:56.965
I never thought
I would see you again.

01:33:57.392 --> 01:33:58.935
Tell me, Karen...

01:33:59.353 --> 01:34:01.392
do you ever have second thoughts
about us?

01:35:37.534 --> 01:35:39.194
Poor child.

01:35:40.954 --> 01:35:42.532
You're so sick.

01:35:43.874 --> 01:35:45.913
So thirsty.

01:35:46.919 --> 01:35:48.294
Don't touch me.

01:35:50.839 --> 01:35:53.413
Eric, look at me.

01:35:53.842 --> 01:35:56.167
Vampires are my people now.

01:35:56.595 --> 01:35:58.219
I'm one of them.

01:35:59.389 --> 01:36:00.718
Can't be.

01:36:02.267 --> 01:36:04.011
Yes, it can.

01:36:07.189 --> 01:36:08.897
Try to understand, Eric.

01:36:10.817 --> 01:36:13.273
Your mother
died a long time ago.

01:36:15.656 --> 01:36:17.114
I've hunted...

01:36:18.742 --> 01:36:20.236
I've killed...

01:36:22.579 --> 01:36:24.406
and I've enjoyed it.

01:36:26.083 --> 01:36:27.281
Haven't you?

01:36:29.002 --> 01:36:30.461
I know you have.

01:36:33.340 --> 01:36:36.376
Sooner or later,
the thirst always wins.

01:37:20.888 --> 01:37:22.133
Come on.

01:37:28.896 --> 01:37:30.141
Spread them out.

01:37:31.273 --> 01:37:33.811
One on each glyph,
under the towers.

01:37:34.234 --> 01:37:36.026
Make it perfect.

01:38:17.194 --> 01:38:18.392
Bring the elevator up.

01:38:58.443 --> 01:38:59.772
You stupid girl.

01:39:00.195 --> 01:39:01.562
What do you think
is going to happen?

01:39:01.662 --> 01:39:03.528
La Magra? The Blood God?

01:39:03.949 --> 01:39:06.985
That's a fairy tale
for pretty little vampires.

01:39:07.411 --> 01:39:08.891
Then why are you sweating,
pureblood?

01:39:10.330 --> 01:39:12.406
You're afraid
we're gonna steal your soul...

01:39:12.833 --> 01:39:14.991
your pureblood spirit?

01:39:15.419 --> 01:39:16.996
You should be.

01:39:17.421 --> 01:39:18.749
Read the prophecy.

01:39:19.172 --> 01:39:22.458
It's time you fucks contributed
something to the cause.

01:39:26.680 --> 01:39:28.720
Even if Frost is right...

01:39:29.141 --> 01:39:30.849
you really think he cares
about you?

01:39:31.268 --> 01:39:34.138
You're gonna die
just like the rest of us.

01:40:10.724 --> 01:40:13.096
Tonight, the age of man
comes to an end.

01:40:13.518 --> 01:40:15.476
No more compromises.

01:40:15.896 --> 01:40:17.355
We're gonna be gods.

01:40:18.857 --> 01:40:20.055
Of course we are.

01:40:23.445 --> 01:40:24.445
I'm gonna be naughty.

01:40:24.863 --> 01:40:27.698
I'm gonna be
a naughty vampire god.

01:40:36.375 --> 01:40:37.833
Gotta stop...

01:40:39.962 --> 01:40:41.504
Save your strength.

01:40:41.922 --> 01:40:43.167
Blue.

01:40:45.259 --> 01:40:47.631
You're hypovolaemic.
You're bleeding to death.

01:40:48.053 --> 01:40:51.422
Need... serum.

01:41:16.290 --> 01:41:17.488
Listen to me.

01:41:19.001 --> 01:41:21.408
I want you
to take some of my blood.

01:41:29.303 --> 01:41:31.628
Look, just do it.

01:41:57.331 --> 01:41:58.576
Is everybody thirsty?

01:41:58.999 --> 01:42:02.783
I hope you're all
very fucking thirsty.

01:42:23.482 --> 01:42:24.680
Don't stop.

01:43:43.687 --> 01:43:45.181
How was it?

01:44:58.595 --> 01:45:00.255
I'm your mother.

01:45:02.599 --> 01:45:04.722
You wouldn't hurt your mother...

01:45:05.143 --> 01:45:06.388
would you?

01:45:08.981 --> 01:45:10.179
Come here.

01:45:14.611 --> 01:45:16.983
I must release you.

01:45:27.875 --> 01:45:28.875
Fuck!

01:46:35.192 --> 01:46:36.437
Not anymore.

01:46:54.294 --> 01:46:55.294
Kill him.

01:46:55.504 --> 01:46:57.212
Wait! I owe you, man.

01:46:57.631 --> 01:46:59.125
I got two new hands, Blade.

01:46:59.550 --> 01:47:01.430
I don't know which one
to use to kill you with!

01:48:46.073 --> 01:48:48.065
I'm really going
to enjoy this now.

01:49:40.335 --> 01:49:42.292
Let's do this.

01:50:36.058 --> 01:50:37.682
You're too late, Blade.

01:50:57.204 --> 01:50:58.746
My turn.

01:51:25.107 --> 01:51:27.479
Look at you.
You're a little bitch.

01:51:29.319 --> 01:51:30.861
What, your serum?

01:51:31.280 --> 01:51:32.822
It can't help you now, stud.

01:51:40.205 --> 01:51:41.486
Nice shot.

01:52:13.614 --> 01:52:17.148
Some motherfuckers are always
trying to ice-skate uphill.

01:52:59.284 --> 01:53:01.241
Let's get out of here.

01:53:36.864 --> 01:53:40.315
I need to get back to the lab
if I'm going to cure you.

01:53:42.286 --> 01:53:43.994
It's not over.

01:53:44.413 --> 01:53:45.788
You keep your cure.

01:53:46.915 --> 01:53:48.409
There's still a war going on...

01:53:48.834 --> 01:53:50.791
and I have a job to do.

01:53:52.087 --> 01:53:53.795
You want to help...

01:53:54.214 --> 01:53:56.337
make me a better serum.

01:53:57.305 --> 01:54:03.939
