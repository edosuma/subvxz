WEBVTT

00:06.998 --> 00:08.431
This night is
a disaster already,

00:08.433 --> 00:09.366
I can feel it.

00:09.368 --> 00:11.368
What? But we haven't
even eaten yet.

00:11.370 --> 00:12.903
When you're on a date

00:12.905 --> 00:15.066
with the mayor
of crazy town,

00:15.068 --> 00:16.894
you can just
sense these things.

00:18.001 --> 00:19.987
I just said I liked
John Cusack movies.

00:19.989 --> 00:21.085
Old ones...

00:21.087 --> 00:23.093
A-and the new ones,

00:24.261 --> 00:25.992
So, what, that
makes me crazy?

00:25.994 --> 00:27.495
I'm just saying,
on a first date...

00:27.497 --> 00:28.728
These things

00:28.730 --> 00:30.328
are best left
unmentioned.

00:30.330 --> 00:31.229
Okay, you're doing

00:31.231 --> 00:33.261
the British accent
thing again.

00:33.263 --> 00:34.429
Am I, darling?

00:34.431 --> 00:36.499
Yes, you do it when
you're feeling insecure.

00:36.501 --> 00:37.401
No...

00:37.403 --> 00:38.339
Yes.

00:38.341 --> 00:39.543
Behavior analyst.

00:39.545 --> 00:40.377
No, no, I do it

00:40.379 --> 00:41.678
when I've
nothing else to say,

00:41.680 --> 00:43.351
and I dread
the silences

00:43.353 --> 00:44.519
between the sayings
of things.

00:44.521 --> 00:45.453
Ah, yes.

00:45.455 --> 00:46.588
What will happen
if they strike?

00:46.590 --> 00:47.823
What will happen?

00:47.825 --> 00:49.724
Uh, death, chaos,
a baseball strike.

00:49.726 --> 00:51.228
Try it.

00:51.230 --> 00:52.497
Oh, this you
telling me to shut up?

00:52.499 --> 00:53.631
Try it.

00:53.633 --> 00:55.032
Okay.

00:57.000 --> 01:03.074

01:04.509 --> 01:06.642
Italian.

01:07.812 --> 01:09.711
The, uh, restaurant
we're going to

01:09.713 --> 01:12.347
is this Italian joint
called "Alfredo's".

01:12.349 --> 01:13.614
You may have
heard of it.

01:13.616 --> 01:16.116
As in five-star review,

01:16.118 --> 01:18.687
"we don't take
reservations" Alfredo's?

01:18.689 --> 01:20.289
For most
people, but...

01:20.291 --> 01:21.457
Oh, really?

01:21.459 --> 01:23.361
Well, I'm a very
influential guy.

01:23.363 --> 01:24.997
Oh.

01:24.999 --> 01:27.032
And I may have also
possibly--

01:27.034 --> 01:28.467
William...

01:28.469 --> 01:29.702
Used my boss's name
to get us a table,

01:29.704 --> 01:32.072
but it's an amazing
table, so...

01:32.074 --> 01:33.340
Well...

01:33.342 --> 01:37.111
That sounds lovely, William!

01:38.347 --> 01:39.513
Tip of the day,

01:39.515 --> 01:40.347
Leave the accents to me.

01:40.349 --> 01:41.348
I do work on them.

01:41.350 --> 01:42.516
Come on, guv'nor!

01:42.518 --> 01:43.583
Let's have a laugh
and a pint!

01:43.585 --> 01:45.418
Abby...

01:45.420 --> 01:47.020
Hi.

01:53.393 --> 01:54.560
Okay...

01:54.562 --> 01:55.761
I'm just going to
reach into my pocket

01:55.763 --> 01:56.795
and get my wallet.

01:56.797 --> 01:58.730
Everything's
in there.

01:58.732 --> 02:01.668
Cash, cards,
take what you want--

02:06.374 --> 02:07.340
Take 'em both.

02:08.376 --> 02:09.476
Hey, hey--

02:10.445 --> 02:12.445
Get in there.

02:12.447 --> 02:14.280
Shut up!

02:37.314 --> 02:40.751
Skinny little punk,
ain't he?

02:40.753 --> 02:43.921
This is a mistake.

02:43.923 --> 02:47.892
If you want money,
we can negotiate that,

02:47.894 --> 02:50.428
but kidnapping us is...

02:50.430 --> 02:53.065
You have
the wrong people.

02:53.067 --> 02:55.201
No, we don't.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.307
You don't know what's going on,

03:00.309 --> 03:02.042
so if you want to stay healthy,

03:02.044 --> 03:04.244
you'll shut up, listen,
and learn,

03:04.246 --> 03:05.446
both of you.

03:05.448 --> 03:07.115
We know exactly
who you are,

03:07.117 --> 03:08.182
Dr. Will Zimmerman,

03:08.184 --> 03:10.952
and you're here
for one reason only.

03:18.226 --> 03:20.361
You save his life,

03:20.363 --> 03:22.931
or you both die.

03:38.203 --> 03:39.203
It doesn't matter
what happened.

03:39.205 --> 03:41.239
Just fix him.

03:41.241 --> 03:43.841
It's obvious that
your friend needs help,

03:43.843 --> 03:45.777
but I am not
your guy.

03:45.779 --> 03:47.279
He's not lying.

03:47.281 --> 03:48.380
You really did kidnap
the wrong person,

03:48.382 --> 03:49.815
or-or people.

03:49.817 --> 03:51.149
You're a doctor.
You work at the Sanctuary.

03:51.151 --> 03:53.352
He's a shrink,

03:53.354 --> 03:55.888
who, yeah, works at
the Sanctuary.

03:55.890 --> 03:57.356
When you put it
like that,

03:57.358 --> 03:58.457
it sounds so cheap.

03:58.459 --> 03:59.625
Okay, we have
nothing to gain

03:59.627 --> 04:00.959
by lying to
these people.

04:00.961 --> 04:02.528
We don't want to deepen
their obvious trust issues,

04:02.530 --> 04:04.462
not to mention exacerbate
the dynamic of paranoia

04:04.464 --> 04:06.931
already at play here.

04:06.933 --> 04:08.232
Oh, I get it now.

04:08.234 --> 04:11.268
FBI Behavioral Science
Department.

04:11.270 --> 04:12.202
Two shrinks!

04:12.204 --> 04:13.069
That's great.

04:13.071 --> 04:14.304
Actually, I'm more of

04:14.306 --> 04:15.272
a clinical
sociologist,

04:15.274 --> 04:17.240
mass pattern
specialist--

04:17.242 --> 04:20.142
Sigmund and Anna Freud,
right here.

04:20.144 --> 04:21.444
Listen,
your friend needs

04:21.446 --> 04:22.745
medical help, okay?

04:22.747 --> 04:25.180
Surgical treatment.

04:25.182 --> 04:26.748
Fine. Get busy.

04:26.750 --> 04:28.350
What about the last
three minutes

04:28.352 --> 04:29.351
did you miss?

04:29.353 --> 04:30.419
I am not a surgeon.

04:30.421 --> 04:31.920
He gets queasy.

04:31.922 --> 04:33.288
What is this?

04:33.290 --> 04:34.790
We need a real doctor,
a scientist or something.

04:34.792 --> 04:36.292
Just haul him off to the ER?

04:36.294 --> 04:38.460
Those quills
aren't normal.

04:38.462 --> 04:40.196
He needs special
treatment,

04:40.198 --> 04:41.496
Sanctuary treatment.

04:41.498 --> 04:42.464
He's screwing with us.

04:42.466 --> 04:44.033
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:44.035 --> 04:45.801
Hold on a second here,

04:45.803 --> 04:48.270
I-I think I understand
what's happening.

04:48.272 --> 04:51.941
You wanted my boss,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.175
but as it happens,
she's out of town,

04:53.177 --> 04:55.177
so you have to
settle for me?

04:55.179 --> 04:56.412
Right?

04:57.849 --> 04:59.816
Wow, that's a shame,

04:59.818 --> 05:03.386
because I would pay
all kinds of money

05:03.388 --> 05:05.388
to see you try to
shanghai Helen Magnus.

05:15.433 --> 05:17.333
Whoa, whoa,
h-h-hold on a sec.

05:17.335 --> 05:19.234
Just hold on, okay?

05:19.236 --> 05:21.336
Just calm down.

05:21.338 --> 05:25.139
Are you testing me, shrink?

05:25.141 --> 05:28.076
No.

05:28.078 --> 05:30.912
I'm-I'm going to see
what I can do here.

05:33.182 --> 05:36.084
Please, assist.

05:42.192 --> 05:43.959
Okay, so, what are
these things anyway?

05:43.961 --> 05:47.163
They look...
like giant quills.

05:47.165 --> 05:48.397
Yeah.

05:48.399 --> 05:50.233
Something
messed him up good.

05:50.235 --> 05:52.835
Something
abnormal, right?

05:52.837 --> 05:54.871
You now what kind?

05:54.873 --> 05:57.373
This is from
a Mongolian Jessoped.

05:57.375 --> 05:59.842
It's a tundra predator.

05:59.844 --> 06:02.345
It releases toxic quills
anytime you corner it,

06:02.347 --> 06:03.813
or piss it off.

06:03.815 --> 06:04.847
Oh, God.

06:04.849 --> 06:06.149
How long till...

06:06.151 --> 06:07.384
If this just happened,

06:07.386 --> 06:08.952
we have some time,

06:08.954 --> 06:10.520
but it's a few hours, max.

06:12.024 --> 06:14.959
So?

06:14.961 --> 06:16.494
Well, I have to get him
back to the Sanctuary

06:16.496 --> 06:18.162
immediately
for treatment--

06:18.164 --> 06:19.497
not a chance.

06:19.499 --> 06:21.300
Because he won't survive
if we don't.

06:21.302 --> 06:22.868
Then neither will you,

06:22.870 --> 06:23.936
or her.

06:23.938 --> 06:25.137
Next option.

06:25.139 --> 06:26.405
There isn't one.

06:26.407 --> 06:28.274
You see, he's been
poisoned,

06:28.276 --> 06:30.509
which means
I need the auto-assist

06:30.511 --> 06:31.610
in the main lab
of the Sanctuary

06:31.612 --> 06:33.312
to create
a counter-toxin.

06:33.314 --> 06:35.281
I need access
to diagnostics machines,

06:35.283 --> 06:36.950
I need saline

06:36.952 --> 06:38.351
and antibiotics
to stabilize him--

06:38.353 --> 06:40.620
and your automatic security

06:40.622 --> 06:42.122
that'll disable us
as soon as we get in there.

06:42.124 --> 06:43.323
No, no.

06:43.325 --> 06:46.226
I can guarantee you
safe passage.

06:46.228 --> 06:47.328
You just have to trust me.

06:47.330 --> 06:50.897
It's not happening.

06:50.899 --> 06:52.132
Do what you
got to do,

06:52.134 --> 06:54.368
but do it here.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.636
We've brought in
everything

06:55.638 --> 07:00.240
that you should need.

07:02.477 --> 07:04.478
I need water, hot water,

07:04.480 --> 07:05.746
towels, a lighter

07:05.748 --> 07:06.447
to sterilize
whatever sharp instrument

07:06.449 --> 07:08.149
you trust me with.

07:09.617 --> 07:11.318
One knife,

07:11.320 --> 07:13.053
and we'll sterilize it.

07:13.055 --> 07:14.454
Koda.

07:21.162 --> 07:22.429
So, uh...

07:22.431 --> 07:24.297
Will, I think--
I think maybe we're done

07:24.299 --> 07:26.667
with the "feeling
them out" phase of things.

07:26.669 --> 07:28.302
They are killers, Will.

07:28.304 --> 07:31.204
No, they're criminals,
or drug dealers.

07:31.206 --> 07:32.571
If we keep our heads,
we will get through this--

07:32.573 --> 07:35.307
No, will, they are killers.

07:35.309 --> 07:36.441
Those viper tattoos
they all have?

07:36.443 --> 07:40.211
It's the symbol
of the Vendetta crew.

07:40.213 --> 07:42.380
A loose affiliation
of contract killers

07:42.382 --> 07:45.049
from North America to Asia.

07:45.051 --> 07:46.583
The FBI has a file
on these guys

07:46.585 --> 07:48.018
a mile long.

07:48.020 --> 07:52.021
They are very bad people, Will.

07:52.023 --> 07:54.423
This must be
their Michael Corleone.

07:59.429 --> 08:01.030
Be careful with it.

08:01.032 --> 08:02.164
It was a gift from my mom.

08:02.166 --> 08:03.266
Oh, God.

08:06.236 --> 08:08.304
I'm going to clean the wound
to get a better look.

08:10.074 --> 08:12.476
Will...

08:14.379 --> 08:16.380
The wounds are pretty nasty.

08:16.382 --> 08:18.015
They're going to
have to come out.

08:18.017 --> 08:19.484
Will...

08:19.486 --> 08:20.585
I know, I know.

08:20.587 --> 08:21.653
I hate blood too.

08:21.655 --> 08:23.121
No, blood
is fine.

08:23.123 --> 08:24.256
It's needles.

08:24.258 --> 08:25.557
A-anything sharp,

08:25.559 --> 08:26.725
I can't stand to have it
near my skin.

08:26.727 --> 08:28.760
It's a total phobia.

08:30.263 --> 08:32.163
Okay, that
is not important now.

08:32.164 --> 08:32.996
Come on.

08:32.999 --> 08:34.498
Hey...

08:34.500 --> 08:37.701
We're going to be fine.

08:37.703 --> 08:39.535
Okay, seriously?

08:39.538 --> 08:42.672
Can you stop with
the baseless affirmations?

08:42.674 --> 08:44.741
Classic violent
group-think dynamic

08:44.743 --> 08:45.741
means that they will use

08:45.743 --> 08:47.209
any form of leverage they can

08:47.211 --> 08:48.244
to get what they want.

08:48.246 --> 08:50.313
I know, that's why
they brought both of us.

08:50.315 --> 08:53.116
Yeah, leverage,
right here, so...

08:53.118 --> 08:54.718
You know, just....

08:54.720 --> 08:57.020
stop telling me everything's
going to be fine.

08:57.022 --> 08:58.088
At least they're human.

08:58.090 --> 08:59.089
You think?

08:59.091 --> 09:00.190
Yeah.

09:00.192 --> 09:02.325
Listen, I've never heard
of this Vendetta crew,

09:02.327 --> 09:04.127
so they're not on
the Sanctuary watch list.

09:04.129 --> 09:05.329
I'm not saying
they're not dangerous,

09:05.331 --> 09:06.764
but, you know,
they're not...

09:06.766 --> 09:08.065
Crazy monsters

09:08.067 --> 09:09.499
that shoot
poison quills?

09:09.501 --> 09:10.700
Yeah.

09:10.702 --> 09:12.368
So there's that.

09:14.038 --> 09:17.240
No matter
what happens, Will,

09:17.242 --> 09:19.542
whether we save
this guy or not,

09:19.544 --> 09:22.312
the faster we cure him,
the sooner we die.

09:23.681 --> 09:25.147
Yeah.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.249
There are a lot
of guns here,

09:27.251 --> 09:29.285
but they're spread out.

09:29.287 --> 09:30.487
There must be a million
places to hide

09:30.489 --> 09:31.421
in this place.

09:31.423 --> 09:32.555
I know.

09:32.557 --> 09:33.890
If we can at least just
get out of this room.

09:33.892 --> 09:36.158
Just need
some kind of distraction.

09:43.634 --> 09:45.134
He's going into
toxic shock.

09:45.136 --> 09:47.336
We don't have
a lot of time.

09:47.338 --> 09:48.537
Okay, we can do this.

09:48.539 --> 09:49.404
We need a plan.

09:49.406 --> 09:50.505
We don't have time.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.373
Follow my lead.

09:52.375 --> 09:54.108
Wait, no, no.
Abby, what are you doing--

09:55.210 --> 09:56.544
we need fresh hot water,

09:56.546 --> 09:58.679
and I need to use
the powder room.

10:09.456 --> 10:12.425
Anything else?

10:23.104 --> 10:25.805
What, no scented hand towels?

10:25.807 --> 10:26.806
Make it fast.

10:26.808 --> 10:28.374
Oh, absolutely,

10:28.376 --> 10:30.609
because you know how much
women love to be rushed.

10:30.611 --> 10:31.577
Out of earshot.

10:33.814 --> 10:35.514
Go.

10:40.253 --> 10:41.787
So, how did you wind up

10:41.789 --> 10:44.789
on the wrong side
of a Jessoped?

10:44.791 --> 10:47.792
This thing,
with the quills.

10:47.794 --> 10:49.794
You just love
to keep pushing me.

10:49.796 --> 10:50.896
No, I just
want to know

10:50.898 --> 10:52.131
why you're risking
his life like this.

10:52.133 --> 10:54.233
Because we don't have time
to mess around.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.602
We're meeting a new supplier,

10:55.604 --> 10:56.636
someone big, a whole new level.

10:56.638 --> 10:58.439
And they'll only deal with him.

10:58.441 --> 11:00.474
Someone else shows up,
and the deal goes sour.

11:00.476 --> 11:01.909
Come on, what is it?

11:01.911 --> 11:02.910
Drugs?

11:02.912 --> 11:04.845
Weapons?

11:04.847 --> 11:06.548
Midnight.

11:06.550 --> 11:08.382
That's how long you have
to get him healthy.

11:08.384 --> 11:10.518
Now, we could
keep bonding,

11:10.520 --> 11:12.520
but you're
on the clock.

11:37.581 --> 11:39.314
Uh...

11:39.316 --> 11:41.883
A little help
in here?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.361
Put 'em down, now!

11:59.672 --> 12:01.304
You don't have the balls
to do this, shrink.

12:01.306 --> 12:02.739
You want to try me?

12:02.741 --> 12:03.973
Because I haven't eaten
since breakfast,

12:03.975 --> 12:06.777
and I get real pissy
when I'm hungry!

12:06.779 --> 12:10.213
I want to hear
those guns hit the floor!

12:13.452 --> 12:14.586
Do what he says.

12:28.934 --> 12:30.735
The gun, please.

12:41.315 --> 12:43.850
Get back to work.

12:50.524 --> 12:53.525
This goes back to my
first year of pre-med.

12:53.527 --> 12:54.726
We need to stop
the seizures.

12:54.728 --> 13:00.666
A combination of
epinephrine and saline.

13:00.668 --> 13:03.001
Okay, sounds-sounds good.

13:06.639 --> 13:07.972
Nice try, by the way.

13:07.974 --> 13:09.541
You too.

13:11.010 --> 13:12.844
Don't ever do that again.

13:15.315 --> 13:16.849
When that gun went off,
I just thought--

13:16.851 --> 13:18.584
Will, I'm-I'm s--

13:18.586 --> 13:19.886
No, no.
No, no, no.

13:19.888 --> 13:21.821
You're not sorry, okay?

13:21.823 --> 13:23.523
I'm sorry.

13:23.525 --> 13:24.391
This is my fault.

13:24.393 --> 13:26.526
Y-you shouldn't be here.

13:26.528 --> 13:28.461
I deserve to be here,
but not you.

13:28.463 --> 13:30.362
Will...

13:32.033 --> 13:34.599
I'm not even worried.

13:34.601 --> 13:36.601
I mean, the make-up sex
is gonna be incr--

13:36.603 --> 13:37.936
uh... date!

13:37.938 --> 13:38.870
Make-up <i> date</i> is gonna be--

13:38.872 --> 13:40.705
Hey!

13:43.676 --> 13:46.343
Okay.

13:46.345 --> 13:48.446
Here goes nothing.

14:07.535 --> 14:08.534
Y-you did it!

14:08.536 --> 14:11.671
Thank you, pre-med.

14:17.077 --> 14:19.010
Will, what
just happened?

14:21.580 --> 14:23.347
I think I just killed him.

14:31.501 --> 14:32.833
What the hell
did you do to him?

14:32.835 --> 14:33.767
Nothing that should have
killed him!

14:33.769 --> 14:35.002
He's not
breathing!

14:35.004 --> 14:36.303
I know! It triggered
a massive heart attack!

14:36.305 --> 14:37.404
Aw, man,
they are so dead--

14:37.406 --> 14:39.373
Just give us a chance
to save him!

14:39.375 --> 14:40.440
Then you're welcome
to kill us, okay?

14:40.442 --> 14:41.375
Just back down, Koda.

14:42.610 --> 14:43.944
Oh, come on...

14:43.946 --> 14:46.413
Will...Will...

14:46.415 --> 14:47.548
You said <i> I</i> went off
half-cocked.

14:47.550 --> 14:48.549
What did you give him,
pure adrenaline?

14:48.551 --> 14:50.284
It was 90% saline.

14:50.286 --> 14:51.952
This shouldn't have happened.

14:51.954 --> 14:53.220
Okay, wait, wait,
what are you doing?

14:53.222 --> 14:54.622
It's a hail Mary,
a triple dose of epi.

14:54.624 --> 14:55.923
Are you crazy?

14:55.925 --> 14:57.057
Yes,

14:57.059 --> 14:58.325
and it's the only thing
that'll work.

15:05.566 --> 15:06.767
Come on, man...

15:06.769 --> 15:07.901
Come on, come back to me!

15:20.914 --> 15:22.014
Oh, God...

15:22.016 --> 15:24.516
Will, how did you know
that would save him?

15:27.987 --> 15:30.489
Would you like
to explain to me

15:30.491 --> 15:32.691
what in the holy hell
just happened?

15:32.693 --> 15:33.693
You tried to kill him!

15:33.695 --> 15:35.161
Like hell I did!

15:35.163 --> 15:36.863
The first shot I gave him
should have stabilized him,

15:36.865 --> 15:39.466
but if you keep
holding out on me,

15:39.468 --> 15:41.901
this is what you get.

15:43.870 --> 15:44.837
Back!

15:46.407 --> 15:47.774
All of you.

15:51.946 --> 15:54.982
This guy
is an abnormal.

15:54.984 --> 15:56.583
That's the only reason
that he would react this way.

15:56.585 --> 15:58.920
Lower your voice.

15:58.922 --> 16:01.122
Something
difficult to detect.

16:01.124 --> 16:02.957
A human offshoot?

16:04.559 --> 16:05.926
He's a Septerran.

16:05.928 --> 16:06.961
Ah.

16:06.963 --> 16:07.895
Full-blooded.

16:07.897 --> 16:09.797
Fifth generation, apparently.

16:09.799 --> 16:11.232
Okay, wait, wait,
what's a--

16:11.234 --> 16:14.168
It means he looks human,
but he's far from it.

16:14.170 --> 16:16.637
Just a little detail
you happened to leave out?

16:16.639 --> 16:17.538
I didn't think
it'd make a difference.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.372
Well, it does!

16:18.374 --> 16:19.773
Lower your voice!

16:19.775 --> 16:21.942
Because they have completely
inverse immune systems,

16:21.944 --> 16:22.977
don't they?

16:22.979 --> 16:24.111
Helen Magnus
would have killed him--

16:24.113 --> 16:25.145
Shut up!

16:25.147 --> 16:25.980
--Without that info!

16:25.982 --> 16:28.082
Why didn't you
tell us?

16:28.084 --> 16:29.083
The others
can't know.

16:29.085 --> 16:31.018
They wouldn't understand.

16:31.020 --> 16:32.019
They wouldn't follow him.

16:34.156 --> 16:35.423
What about you?

16:36.791 --> 16:38.192
Two hours!

16:38.194 --> 16:40.027
That's how long
you have to save him,

16:40.029 --> 16:42.430
or you both take a bullet!

16:42.432 --> 16:44.832
No mystery what that'll do.

16:47.502 --> 16:48.869
That's getting old.

16:56.579 --> 17:00.582
Buddy, buddy!

17:00.584 --> 17:03.185
If you keep screaming at me
like that, I'm just gonna--

17:03.187 --> 17:04.886
no, no!

17:04.887 --> 17:09.156
No, no, I don't know
what happened to Mr. Will.

17:09.159 --> 17:10.992
No--

17:10.993 --> 17:12.861
am I his girlfriend?

17:12.863 --> 17:14.162
Dude, have you
seen the guy?

17:14.164 --> 17:16.897
He's a matchstick
with hair gel.

17:16.900 --> 17:18.098
Oh, really?

17:18.101 --> 17:18.867
Well, maybe I should ask
the health inspector

17:18.868 --> 17:21.670
to pay you a surprise visit--

17:21.672 --> 17:23.171
yeah, well,

17:23.173 --> 17:26.709
just be glad I don't
<i>parlez italiano</i> .

17:29.746 --> 17:30.780
Who was that?

17:32.116 --> 17:35.084
The maitre 'd at Alfredo's.

17:35.086 --> 17:37.786
<i>El furioso</i> that Will
reserved a private table

17:37.788 --> 17:38.754
in Magnus's name.

17:41.726 --> 17:43.593
Always liked the cut
of that man's jib.

17:43.595 --> 17:44.527
Big date.

17:44.529 --> 17:46.462
Gotta make things happen.

17:46.464 --> 17:47.663
Yeah, well, they're
none too happy about it.

17:47.665 --> 17:49.064
Why are they
in a twist?

17:49.066 --> 17:51.100
A customer's
a customer.

17:51.102 --> 17:52.268
Because according to
screamy mcnaples,

17:52.270 --> 17:54.237
Will and Abby never showed up.

17:54.239 --> 17:55.872
Say what?

17:55.874 --> 17:57.874
"It's like poison
to my mother's eyes,

17:57.876 --> 17:58.842
an empty table!

17:58.844 --> 18:00.010
Ai..."

18:01.046 --> 18:02.546
I love Italians.

18:02.548 --> 18:03.681
So passionate.

18:03.683 --> 18:04.782
He said in 30 years

18:04.784 --> 18:05.884
they've never once
had a no-show.

18:05.886 --> 18:07.820
Yeah, well, maybe
the food's slipping.

18:07.822 --> 18:08.854
Alfredo's?

18:08.856 --> 18:10.089
Not a chance.

18:10.091 --> 18:11.824
That place is booked up
months in advance

18:11.826 --> 18:12.792
for good reason.

18:12.794 --> 18:15.728
It's odd that he didn't
at least call.

18:15.730 --> 18:16.863
Hmm.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.132
Guys...

18:19.134 --> 18:20.767
Thinking out loud here,

18:20.769 --> 18:23.937
but maybe his date with Abby
got off to a good start.

18:27.675 --> 18:28.976
As in, a really good start.

18:32.581 --> 18:33.915
As in they never left
her apartment!

18:33.917 --> 18:35.016
Work with me,
people!

18:36.985 --> 18:38.019
No, not a chance.

18:39.121 --> 18:40.754
Mate, the food's that good?

18:40.756 --> 18:41.989
Yes.

18:41.991 --> 18:46.994
Better than spontaneous
pre-date nookie?

18:46.996 --> 18:49.597
Yes.

18:53.034 --> 18:54.735
I need some supplies.

18:54.737 --> 18:56.270
Now, before you get
all Alpha-dog on me,

18:56.272 --> 18:58.272
hear me out.

18:58.274 --> 19:00.541
Yes, I've seen wounds
like this before.

19:00.543 --> 19:01.842
One of our operatives
got quilled

19:01.844 --> 19:03.678
on a mission last year.

19:03.680 --> 19:06.114
Now, I've cobbled together
a counter-toxin from memory,

19:06.116 --> 19:09.183
but I'm missing
a few key ingredients.

19:13.090 --> 19:15.324
"Radon firebrats.

19:15.326 --> 19:18.227
Savoy leech extract?"

19:18.229 --> 19:19.761
These elements are
what we call "red list".

19:19.763 --> 19:21.964
It means they're only available
on the local black market.

19:21.966 --> 19:23.599
There's a list of suppliers
who sell them there, too.

19:24.868 --> 19:26.834
You really think
I'm going to let you

19:26.836 --> 19:28.569
go to the mall
right now?

19:28.571 --> 19:29.770
Send Abby.

19:29.772 --> 19:32.906
Have one of your
Rhodes scholars

19:32.908 --> 19:35.074
escort her.

19:35.076 --> 19:36.309
Listen, if you want me
to save your boss,

19:36.311 --> 19:39.078
then this is what I need.

19:41.214 --> 19:43.383
If you mess with me

19:43.385 --> 19:45.050
or you try to make contact
with the Sanctuary--

19:45.052 --> 19:46.151
she dies.

19:46.153 --> 19:47.186
I get it.

19:49.856 --> 19:53.226
Are we going to
do this or not?

19:55.295 --> 19:56.162
Koda...

19:57.998 --> 19:59.666
Take the lady shopping.

19:59.668 --> 20:01.268
If she tries to run,

20:01.270 --> 20:02.970
shoot her.

20:02.972 --> 20:05.172
Copy that.

20:09.879 --> 20:11.613
Show him the red box.

20:11.615 --> 20:13.248
The red one.
Open it and then run.

20:13.250 --> 20:16.752
Got it?

20:17.988 --> 20:23.091
Okay, so, uh...
You sure about this?

20:23.093 --> 20:26.694
Just get everything
on the list.

20:26.696 --> 20:28.096
You step outside
the line,

20:28.098 --> 20:30.231
he's dead.

21:25.019 --> 21:26.954
Okay, his handwriting
is like a fifth grader's.

21:26.956 --> 21:29.756
Well, that was
the last thing on the list.

21:29.758 --> 21:32.860
I think we got
everything.

21:32.862 --> 21:34.228
Your boyfriend's
into some freaky stuff.

21:34.230 --> 21:36.230
Okay, not
my boyfriend.

21:36.232 --> 21:37.398
I already
told you that.

21:37.400 --> 21:39.833
Can you hold that?

21:39.835 --> 21:41.101
I hope they gave us
the right thing.

21:41.103 --> 21:42.703
Can you just check?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.253
Where are you?

22:00.255 --> 22:01.187
What?

22:03.358 --> 22:05.791
How long ago?

22:07.094 --> 22:09.062
Watch him!

22:11.532 --> 22:14.066
I could use a hand here, guys.

22:14.068 --> 22:16.068
I need to change his bandages.

22:16.070 --> 22:17.236
Could wait till he has
another seizure,

22:17.238 --> 22:19.404
but it's going to be
a lot harder then.

22:19.406 --> 22:20.606
Okay, just go easy,

22:20.608 --> 22:21.340
'cause his wounds
could open--

22:35.387 --> 22:37.120
Get up.

22:40.091 --> 22:41.459
Your girlfriend sicked
one of those freaks she bought

22:41.461 --> 22:42.293
on my boy.

22:42.295 --> 22:44.896
No kidding?

22:44.898 --> 22:46.431
Big mistake.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.200
Without the shopping list,
you can't make the cure.

22:48.202 --> 22:49.935
No cure means
you're useless to me.

22:49.937 --> 22:51.437
Thanks for the house-call.

22:51.439 --> 22:53.039
Don't! Don't!

22:53.041 --> 22:54.841
Oh, Abby, no...

22:54.843 --> 22:57.010
I'm sorry, Will.

23:09.789 --> 23:11.790
Ain't love grand?

23:16.987 --> 23:18.020
Hold still.

23:20.503 --> 23:23.703
I thought I gave you
specific instructions.

23:23.705 --> 23:25.606
Open the red box
and then run,

23:25.608 --> 23:26.941
and I did.

23:26.943 --> 23:28.008
And what about

23:28.010 --> 23:29.844
contacting
the Sanctuary for help?

23:29.846 --> 23:31.779
They were going
to shoot you.

23:31.781 --> 23:33.080
I just thought, you know,

23:33.082 --> 23:37.519
might as well make
that counter-toxin

23:37.521 --> 23:38.887
and buy some more time.

23:38.889 --> 23:41.056
Abby...

23:41.058 --> 23:42.658
I am not leaving
this date

23:42.660 --> 23:44.393
until it is
officially over,

23:44.395 --> 23:46.062
and...

23:46.064 --> 23:49.399
I think it's going quite well.

23:50.402 --> 23:51.567
Don't you?

23:55.539 --> 23:56.672
Yes, I do.

24:01.671 --> 24:03.538
What was in the red box?

24:03.540 --> 24:07.742
It's called
a Moroccan Cave Scorpion.

24:07.744 --> 24:09.544
It's a nasty little bastard,
isn't it?

24:09.546 --> 24:11.646
It bit his face.

24:13.684 --> 24:15.684
Yeah, you're normally
not supposed to release one

24:15.686 --> 24:18.254
without wearing
a welder's mask and gloves.

24:18.256 --> 24:20.389
Noted for next time.

24:24.494 --> 24:28.498
I really hope
you didn't need this alive.

24:32.136 --> 24:34.505
Nice move.

24:43.413 --> 24:46.714
Okay, so no witnesses saw them
go anywhere near Alfredo's,

24:46.716 --> 24:48.683
but we got
something else.

24:48.685 --> 24:49.517
What's this?

24:49.519 --> 24:51.285
Black market stuff.

24:51.287 --> 24:52.252
Red list dealers.

24:52.254 --> 24:53.453
I got a call
from Squid

24:53.455 --> 24:55.445
asking us why we didn't
go to him for firebrats.

24:55.458 --> 24:57.035
Accusing us
of undercutting him

24:57.059 --> 24:58.360
as our supplier.
Firebrats.

24:58.427 --> 24:59.582
We haven't bought any recently.

24:59.616 --> 25:01.416
Well, someone did,
tonight,

25:01.477 --> 25:02.509
a woman.

25:02.511 --> 25:03.610
She bought a pod from Remy

25:03.612 --> 25:05.645
and asked for
the Sanctuary rate.

25:05.647 --> 25:07.080
She was wholesome, sweet,

25:07.082 --> 25:08.515
couldn't haggle
to save her life.

25:08.517 --> 25:09.850
Abby.

25:09.852 --> 25:11.518
What the hell is she doing
buying red list materials?

25:11.520 --> 25:13.086
And check out
the list.

25:13.088 --> 25:14.821
Harper mites, Savoy leeches,

25:14.823 --> 25:16.089
and get this,
a Moroccan Cave Scorpion.

25:16.091 --> 25:17.858
Ooh, they're nasty.

25:17.860 --> 25:18.892
I cross-referenced
the list

25:18.894 --> 25:19.894
in the database,

25:19.896 --> 25:21.762
and all of them
except for the scorpion

25:21.764 --> 25:23.897
are ingredients that make up
a counter-toxin for--

25:23.899 --> 25:25.999
Jessoped attack.

25:26.001 --> 25:26.934
Right.

25:26.936 --> 25:28.001
No direct contact
from Will

25:28.003 --> 25:29.770
likely means
the situation's not good.

25:29.772 --> 25:31.839
You think he's infected?

25:31.841 --> 25:34.207
Well, if one of them's hurt,
why not come here?

25:34.209 --> 25:35.909
Exactly.

25:35.911 --> 25:37.777
You know, I think that Will
told Abby to get those things

25:37.779 --> 25:38.978
knowing that it would
grab our attention.

25:38.980 --> 25:41.614
He needs our help.

25:43.016 --> 25:44.115
This is crazy.

25:44.117 --> 25:46.184
Yeah, well, tell her that.

25:53.426 --> 25:55.127
No, Abby, Abby,
no, no, no.

25:55.129 --> 25:56.295
This is crazy.

25:56.297 --> 25:57.729
He needs proper
medical treatment--

25:57.731 --> 25:59.564
Keep playing nurse, cupcake.

25:59.566 --> 26:00.999
But he--

26:01.001 --> 26:01.833
Is there something wrong
with your hearing?

26:01.835 --> 26:02.734
No--

26:02.736 --> 26:03.769
Abby.

26:09.108 --> 26:11.243
It's that new thing
called sarcasm.

26:11.245 --> 26:13.145
I was trying to appeal
to her compassionate side.

26:13.147 --> 26:14.947
But you're making her
look weak.

26:14.949 --> 26:16.982
Yeah, or she's read
the bad guy playbook.

26:16.984 --> 26:17.983
She's the perfect mix

26:17.985 --> 26:18.884
of violent
and crazy../

26:18.886 --> 26:20.319
don't forget paranoid.

26:20.321 --> 26:21.921
I just think there are
a lot of things

26:21.923 --> 26:23.356
that don't add up.

26:23.358 --> 26:25.891
I mean, so they get attacked
by that spiky creature,

26:25.893 --> 26:26.759
a...

26:26.761 --> 26:28.027
Jessoped.

26:29.596 --> 26:31.964
Their boss gets quilled,
and they call in you?

26:31.966 --> 26:36.969
Well, I do happen to be
number two

26:36.971 --> 26:39.771
at the most advanced
medical facility in the world.

26:39.773 --> 26:41.773
Okay, and bravo for that,

26:41.775 --> 26:43.241
but, I mean,
Will, come on,

26:43.243 --> 26:44.309
you are really not

26:44.311 --> 26:45.744
the right person
for this job.

26:45.746 --> 26:47.612
Admit it, you're tap dancing
to save this guy,

26:47.614 --> 26:49.014
and I think she knows it.

26:51.183 --> 26:52.584
Disparaging much?

26:52.586 --> 26:56.789
Suddenly you <i> are</i> an expert
in exotic poisons?

26:56.791 --> 27:00.292
Well, why couldn't I be?

27:00.294 --> 27:02.861
Okay.

27:02.863 --> 27:04.330
I was just thinking out loud.

27:04.332 --> 27:07.599
Sounded like you were
emasculating out loud.

27:10.171 --> 27:11.837
Okay.

27:11.839 --> 27:13.372
No, look,

27:13.374 --> 27:16.809
I will admit
that it is a little wonky.

27:16.811 --> 27:18.044
I mean, if you want
to save your boss,

27:18.046 --> 27:19.344
there are better ways
than kidnapping me.

27:19.346 --> 27:20.212
Agreed.

27:20.214 --> 27:21.613
Just sayin'.

27:23.984 --> 27:25.151
Would you pass me that, please?

27:25.153 --> 27:27.620
Yes, sir...

27:27.622 --> 27:28.855
Number two.

28:34.422 --> 28:37.224
Turns out Will was more clever
than we first thought.

28:37.226 --> 28:39.394
We've triangulated
all the red list purchases.

28:39.396 --> 28:40.662
They're all
in the fifth ward,

28:40.664 --> 28:42.097
and they're all
in this area here.

28:42.099 --> 28:43.332
Four street sales.
Two city blocks.

28:43.334 --> 28:44.967
Thermal tracking
and energy grid spikes

28:44.969 --> 28:47.103
show major activity

28:47.105 --> 28:48.771
in this building

28:48.773 --> 28:49.906
less than three blocks
from here.

28:49.908 --> 28:51.708
He gave us
his location.

28:51.710 --> 28:53.377
Indeed.
Clever lad.

28:53.379 --> 28:54.912
The plot thickens.

28:54.914 --> 28:56.113
Word is

28:56.115 --> 28:57.414
people from something
called the Vendetta crew

28:57.416 --> 28:59.949
ran into
a Jessoped tonight.

28:59.951 --> 29:01.317
Vendetta crew?

29:01.319 --> 29:03.453
Heard of them.
Nasty bunch.

29:03.455 --> 29:04.387
Well, it seems
like their boss,

29:04.389 --> 29:05.621
one Horatio Gibbs,

29:05.623 --> 29:06.722
got hit by a bunch
of toxic quills

29:06.724 --> 29:08.424
at a weapons buy
gone bad.

29:08.426 --> 29:10.058
So this Gibbs guy
gets quilled,

29:10.060 --> 29:11.059
they kidnap Will

29:11.061 --> 29:12.394
to make them
a counter-toxin.

29:12.396 --> 29:13.428
Wrong man for the job.

29:13.430 --> 29:14.862
Tell me
about it.

29:14.864 --> 29:15.730
Good news is

29:15.732 --> 29:16.864
we've got
a possible location.

29:16.866 --> 29:18.299
I'll put together
a tactical team.

29:21.235 --> 29:24.404
Okay, so it's
coming up on 11:00.

29:24.406 --> 29:26.239
How long till
this is ready?

29:26.241 --> 29:29.276
Uh, half an hour ago.

29:29.278 --> 29:32.245
I've been thinking
about your theory,

29:32.247 --> 29:34.881
that Sioux's temper
is all an act.

29:34.883 --> 29:36.884
You might be right.

29:36.886 --> 29:39.053
Her body language
is all wrong.

29:39.055 --> 29:40.955
Her autonomic responses
aren't aggressive.

29:40.957 --> 29:43.525
She's self conscious,

29:43.527 --> 29:45.794
or stressed out.

29:45.796 --> 29:48.130
Because she's
hiding something.

29:49.466 --> 29:50.466
Huh...

30:11.119 --> 30:12.953
You wanted
confirmation.

30:14.923 --> 30:17.492
Hello, gangsters.

30:17.494 --> 30:19.795
Right under our noses.

30:19.797 --> 30:21.263
Pound to a penny

30:21.265 --> 30:23.799
those lads are holding
Will and Abby inside.

30:23.801 --> 30:25.101
We should have
the tactical team

30:25.103 --> 30:26.369
weapon up.

30:26.371 --> 30:27.236
Absolutely.

30:28.305 --> 30:31.141
So, that's...

30:31.143 --> 30:32.276
Yeah, pretty much.

30:32.278 --> 30:34.111
And it'll...

30:34.113 --> 30:36.413
Pretty sure.

30:36.415 --> 30:38.281
If we give it to him,
we die.

30:38.283 --> 30:39.516
If we don't
give it to him...

30:39.518 --> 30:41.284
We're killers?

30:41.286 --> 30:43.819
And we probably die.

30:43.821 --> 30:46.522
Time's ticking.

30:48.491 --> 30:50.125
Okay.

31:04.808 --> 31:07.143
What's wrong?

31:07.145 --> 31:08.511
Everything.

31:08.513 --> 31:10.246
Hold positions
and wait for the command.

31:10.248 --> 31:12.182
And clean targets.

31:12.184 --> 31:14.584
We want to bring them home
in one piece.

31:18.021 --> 31:19.889
Hey. Why aren't you
geared up?

31:19.891 --> 31:22.458
The mission's been scrubbed.

31:22.460 --> 31:23.291
You're all to stand down.

31:23.293 --> 31:25.127
On whose orders?

31:26.295 --> 31:28.262
Helen Magnus.

31:34.442 --> 31:36.475
<i>I know this is time sensitive,</i>

31:36.482 --> 31:37.915
<i>but Henry and I</i>
<i>won't be back there</i>

31:37.917 --> 31:39.050
<i>until tomorrow.</i>

31:39.052 --> 31:40.952
Doc, we have
Will and Abby's location.

31:40.954 --> 31:42.687
They're hostages.
What's the problem?

31:42.689 --> 31:45.023
<i>There are a number of details</i>
<i>concerning this Vendetta crew</i>

31:45.025 --> 31:46.692
<i>that you need to know.</i>

31:46.694 --> 31:47.659
I had a friend
at Interpol

31:47.661 --> 31:48.961
send me a file.

31:48.963 --> 31:50.096
They're a band of killers,
international.

31:50.098 --> 31:51.431
No abnormal activity
among them

31:51.433 --> 31:52.799
that I can detect.

31:52.801 --> 31:54.734
<i>True, but they are</i>
<i>of special interest</i>

31:54.736 --> 31:56.470
<i>to our covert operatives</i>
<i>at the Beijing Sanctuary.</i>

31:56.472 --> 31:57.804
Because?

31:57.806 --> 31:59.005
<i>Beijing believes</i>

31:59.007 --> 32:01.074
<i>that the Vendetta leader,</i>
<i>Gibbs,</i>

32:01.076 --> 32:03.877
<i>is close to connecting with</i>
<i>a ring of abnormal smugglers.</i>

32:03.879 --> 32:05.712
<i>In fact, our intel indicates</i>

32:05.714 --> 32:08.482
<i>that he's due to connect</i>
<i>with a slave ship</i>

32:08.484 --> 32:09.483
<i>at some point tonight.</i>

32:09.485 --> 32:10.985
The "ghost ship"?

32:10.987 --> 32:12.453
You're joking.

32:12.455 --> 32:15.056
Unregistered vessel
carrying hundreds of abnormals

32:15.058 --> 32:17.592
to be sold on
the black market... as slaves.

32:17.594 --> 32:19.060
I thought that was a myth.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.528
<i>We've been trying</i>
<i>to shut them down</i>

32:20.530 --> 32:21.396
<i>for months.</i>

32:21.398 --> 32:22.764
<i>We think Gibbs knows</i>

32:22.766 --> 32:25.534
<i>when and where</i>
<i>that ship will dock.</i>

32:25.536 --> 32:27.002
<i>If we storm that building now,</i>

32:27.004 --> 32:28.704
<i>we may well lose</i>
<i>our only chance</i>

32:28.706 --> 32:30.139
<i>to find that ship.</i>

32:30.141 --> 32:31.774
So, what, we just
sit on our hands and wait?

32:31.776 --> 32:33.543
<i>I know it's intolerable, Kate,</i>

32:33.545 --> 32:35.012
<i>but for now,</i>

32:35.014 --> 32:36.880
<i>I ask that you keep</i>
<i>a close watch on the situation,</i>

32:36.882 --> 32:38.015
<i>and hope that Will</i>

32:38.017 --> 32:39.683
<i>can handle things</i>
<i>on his own.</i>

32:39.685 --> 32:41.084
<i>I've seen the list</i>
<i>of ingredients</i>

32:41.086 --> 32:42.719
<i>he had Abby purchase.</i>

32:42.721 --> 32:44.488
<i>He does in fact</i>
<i>have everything he needs</i>

32:44.490 --> 32:45.555
<i>to make that counter-toxin.</i>

32:45.557 --> 32:47.791
<i>Now, with luck,</i>

32:47.793 --> 32:49.859
<i>Will will keep Gibbs alive</i>
<i>long enough</i>

32:49.861 --> 32:52.128
<i>for us to follow him</i>
<i>to that ship.</i>

32:52.130 --> 32:53.763
<i>I'm sorry,</i>

32:53.765 --> 32:55.731
<i>but there far are too many</i>
<i>innocents at stake.</i>

32:58.802 --> 33:00.169
Time's up.

33:00.171 --> 33:04.540
You better have
something for me.

33:04.542 --> 33:06.509
Oh, this is ready,

33:06.511 --> 33:07.877
but, uh,

33:07.879 --> 33:09.913
I'm not going to
give it to him.

33:09.915 --> 33:11.414
The hell you won't.

33:11.416 --> 33:12.649
I've had enough
of this lying crap.

33:12.651 --> 33:13.750
Who is this man?

33:13.752 --> 33:14.718
Stop.

33:17.489 --> 33:20.792
He's in severe tachycardia,

33:20.794 --> 33:21.860
which,

33:21.862 --> 33:23.996
if you knew anything
about Septerrans,

33:23.998 --> 33:25.931
you would know that
that's impossible.

33:25.933 --> 33:26.765
He's got a heart-rate

33:26.767 --> 33:28.000
half that of
a human being's.

33:28.002 --> 33:30.569
His body should be
shutting down

33:30.571 --> 33:31.604
from the toxins.

33:31.606 --> 33:35.041
Would you like to speak to me?

33:36.076 --> 33:38.712
Stay. Koda.

33:42.750 --> 33:45.118
Yeah, okay.

33:48.489 --> 33:50.190
You force us in here,
you abuse us,

33:50.192 --> 33:51.524
you're all kinds
of tough,

33:51.526 --> 33:52.959
but you know
what I think?

33:52.961 --> 33:56.229
I think you're
hiding something.

33:56.231 --> 33:58.564
Sit down.

34:06.072 --> 34:07.505
Okay?

34:07.507 --> 34:08.672
So he's not a Septerran.

34:08.675 --> 34:10.641
No, he's not.

34:10.643 --> 34:11.976
Then what is he?

34:13.844 --> 34:14.911
A rare hybrid.

34:14.914 --> 34:15.879
And you've known this
all along.

34:15.880 --> 34:17.848
Of course I did.

34:17.850 --> 34:19.850
The plan was to kill him,
not save him.

34:19.851 --> 34:21.952
Why?

34:21.954 --> 34:23.120
So you could get
a bigger percentage?

34:26.090 --> 34:28.824
Gibbs wants to deal
in abnormal slaves.

34:28.827 --> 34:31.194
The supplier
we're meeting tonight

34:31.196 --> 34:33.496
is selling a shipload
from Asia.

34:33.498 --> 34:36.266
The ghost ship.

34:38.136 --> 34:39.136
That's your supplier.

34:41.706 --> 34:44.041
We've been looking
for that thing for months.

34:44.043 --> 34:47.043
I won't deal in slaves,
human or otherwise.

34:47.045 --> 34:49.112
That's not why
I joined this crew.

34:49.114 --> 34:51.882
I tried to talk Gibbs
out of it,

34:51.885 --> 34:53.885
but he said
the money was too huge.

34:55.954 --> 34:58.722
Why didn't you turn him in,
or come to us?

34:58.724 --> 35:00.791
Vendetta's reach is too deep.

35:00.793 --> 35:02.059
If it looked like
I tried to roll him over,

35:02.061 --> 35:03.461
I'd be dead.

35:03.463 --> 35:05.530
So instead you sicked
a Jessoped on him

35:05.532 --> 35:06.731
to take him out of the play?

35:06.733 --> 35:07.732
The only thing
I didn't count on

35:07.734 --> 35:09.100
was his resistance
to the quills.

35:09.102 --> 35:11.269
I was hoping
it'd kill him faster.

35:11.271 --> 35:13.839
And when that didn't work,

35:13.841 --> 35:16.909
you ruined the only date
I've had in months.

35:16.911 --> 35:19.812
I needed someone
who might be able to save him--

35:19.814 --> 35:22.080
but would fail.

35:24.650 --> 35:28.587
If you try to save him,
and he dies,

35:28.589 --> 35:29.755
you might get out of here.

35:31.924 --> 35:34.259
But if they find out you were
trying to kill Gibbs...

35:35.795 --> 35:37.863
You understand?

35:37.865 --> 35:39.131
Gibbs can't meet that ship.

35:39.133 --> 35:41.333
Not tonight, not ever.

35:48.308 --> 35:50.876
The counter-toxin I made
will kill him

35:50.878 --> 35:52.611
if I don't modify it.

35:52.613 --> 35:54.047
That's what I'm hoping for--

36:02.221 --> 36:03.755
I knew that bitch
was hiding something.

36:03.757 --> 36:04.856
Will...

36:04.858 --> 36:06.023
You let her go!

36:06.025 --> 36:07.358
You're gonna finish
what you started,

36:07.360 --> 36:09.059
and make it fast.

36:09.061 --> 36:12.762
You've got
two patients now.

36:21.356 --> 36:22.356
We're in position.

36:22.358 --> 36:24.358
<i>They got one at the door.</i>

36:26.961 --> 36:29.096
Two on the roof.

36:29.098 --> 36:30.797
No one's come
in or out of the building.

36:30.799 --> 36:34.234
Far as we know,
Will and Abby are still inside.

36:35.403 --> 36:36.838
Oh, God.

36:36.840 --> 36:38.172
How bad is it?
It's bad, right?

36:38.174 --> 36:39.173
D-don't look, okay?

36:39.175 --> 36:40.475
I just want you
to breathe.

36:40.477 --> 36:41.910
I'm going to give you
the counter-toxin.

36:41.912 --> 36:43.745
No, Will, I told you.

36:43.747 --> 36:44.913
I-I hate needles.

36:44.915 --> 36:47.049
She's not
the priority, dude!

36:47.051 --> 36:47.883
He is.

36:47.885 --> 36:49.285
She's human.

36:49.287 --> 36:51.054
The quills will affect her
faster than him.

36:51.056 --> 36:52.388
She needs treatment now!

36:52.390 --> 36:53.723
Yeah, well, you should
have thought of that

36:53.725 --> 36:56.426
before you had a scorpion
bite my face!

36:56.428 --> 36:57.361
Make it work,

36:57.363 --> 36:58.328
or I put a bullet
in her right now.

36:58.330 --> 36:59.195
If you want him
to live,

36:59.197 --> 37:01.097
nothing happens to her!

37:01.099 --> 37:02.031
Get to work.

37:09.239 --> 37:10.339
Okay...

37:11.875 --> 37:14.276
Just stay with me, Abby.

37:14.278 --> 37:15.477
I told you, Will.

37:15.479 --> 37:17.479
It's all about
leverage.

37:17.481 --> 37:19.381
That's why they brought me too.

37:19.383 --> 37:21.016
Yeah, I know.

37:21.018 --> 37:22.017
Just keep breathing, okay?

37:23.320 --> 37:25.287
Was...

37:25.289 --> 37:29.157
Was the food really that good
at Alfredo's?

37:29.159 --> 37:31.126
I really wanted to try
the agnolotti.

37:31.128 --> 37:35.330
I heard
it was delicious.

37:35.332 --> 37:37.032
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

37:37.034 --> 37:40.202
You're going to love it.

37:40.204 --> 37:44.106
I thought maybe we'd start
with a nice sangiovese.

37:44.108 --> 37:45.808
Maybe a caprese salad.

37:47.311 --> 37:48.711
And dessert?

37:48.713 --> 37:53.049
They have this beautiful
torta della cioccolata.

37:53.051 --> 37:54.984
It's to die for.

37:54.986 --> 37:56.085
Yummy.

37:59.790 --> 38:00.890
Abby, breathe.

38:00.892 --> 38:02.926
Stay on target, hero.

38:02.928 --> 38:03.927
He dies,
she's next--

38:03.929 --> 38:05.161
Yes, I got it!

38:27.868 --> 38:29.035
What the hell happened?

38:29.037 --> 38:30.904
Welcome back, man.

38:37.079 --> 38:38.478
How long was I...

38:38.480 --> 38:40.780
Uh, a few hours.

38:40.782 --> 38:42.181
The ship?

38:42.183 --> 38:43.282
We still got time to meet it
if you're good to go.

38:44.784 --> 38:45.985
Load up the men.
We're leaving.

39:00.033 --> 39:03.034
You're from
the Sanctuary, right?

39:03.036 --> 39:04.135
Yeah.

39:04.137 --> 39:06.070
You did all this?

39:06.072 --> 39:07.772
Yeah.

39:07.774 --> 39:11.908
Guess I owe you my life.

39:12.703 --> 39:13.870
You bastard!

39:13.900 --> 39:15.534
Give my regards
to Helen Magnus.

39:15.535 --> 39:17.836
Tell her that ship
and everything on it

39:17.931 --> 39:19.564
now belongs to me.

39:33.815 --> 39:36.551
She seemed nice.

39:48.829 --> 39:50.096
Abby...

39:50.098 --> 39:52.831
It's okay, Will.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.767
You tried.

39:54.769 --> 39:56.801
No. Leverage.

39:56.803 --> 39:59.138
I told you.

39:59.140 --> 40:01.807
Yeah...

40:01.809 --> 40:04.477
And I listened.

40:06.146 --> 40:07.547
Clever boy.

40:07.549 --> 40:10.117
In case one of us
got poisoned.

40:11.153 --> 40:12.420
No, no, no, no...

40:12.422 --> 40:14.155
Will, can't you--
can't you just

40:14.157 --> 40:16.625
turn it into a pill,

40:16.627 --> 40:20.728
or a-a lotion
or something, please?

40:20.730 --> 40:22.496
Shh, just
be still, okay?

40:37.544 --> 40:38.711
I didn't feel anything.

40:40.547 --> 40:42.448
The needle or the kiss?

40:44.517 --> 40:46.084
There was a kiss?

41:04.838 --> 41:06.873
Signal them.

41:16.851 --> 41:18.118
Radio the other trucks.

41:18.120 --> 41:19.954
The ship's only docking
for 20 minutes,

41:19.956 --> 41:23.123
and we have a lot of guests
to transport.

41:23.125 --> 41:24.858
I don't think so!

41:24.860 --> 41:27.227
Put it down!
Put it down now!

41:30.497 --> 41:31.464
Down!

41:32.632 --> 41:33.866
Put it down!

41:38.839 --> 41:41.874
Glad you're feeling better.

41:52.120 --> 41:53.020
Long night?

41:55.223 --> 41:56.957
What time is it?

41:56.959 --> 41:59.292
It's about noon.

41:59.294 --> 42:01.961
How's that jet lag?

42:01.963 --> 42:03.596
I just didn't want to
go to bed until we--

42:03.598 --> 42:04.830
No, she's fine.

42:04.832 --> 42:07.966
That counter-toxin
worked like a charm.

42:07.968 --> 42:10.268
Who knew
I had that kind of game, huh?

42:10.270 --> 42:12.637
From memory,

42:12.639 --> 42:13.904
with no lab to speak of.

42:13.906 --> 42:15.873
At gunpoint, no less.

42:15.875 --> 42:17.842
Incredibly
well done, Will.

42:17.844 --> 42:19.176
Thank you,

42:19.178 --> 42:20.277
and with Gibbs
and the slave trades

42:20.279 --> 42:21.512
all locked up,

42:21.514 --> 42:24.215
it'd say that's what
we call a win-win.

42:24.217 --> 42:25.283
True.

42:25.285 --> 42:26.717
However...

42:26.719 --> 42:28.753
Here we go.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.154
Using my name
to get a table

42:30.156 --> 42:31.656
at my favorite
restaurant?

42:31.658 --> 42:33.925
Incredibly low-brow,
Will.

42:33.927 --> 42:35.259
I'm still trying to make
amends with Alfredo.

42:35.261 --> 42:39.030
And I still
owe Abby a date, so...

42:39.032 --> 42:39.998
I've never eaten
at this restaurant.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.699
Is the food really that good?

42:42.835 --> 42:46.871
Oh... it's that good.
