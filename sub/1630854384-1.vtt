WEBVTT

00:01.702 --> 00:03.904
[Andi] Previously on "Sistas".

00:04.003 --> 00:05.005
What are you doing here?

00:05.105 --> 00:06.073
You won't talk to me.

00:06.173 --> 00:07.541
And I still won't.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.676
I am trying everything
I can to say that I'm sorry.

00:09.776 --> 00:11.445
He bought me a
penthouse apartment.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.113
-I'm pregnant.
-Who's the daddy?

00:13.213 --> 00:14.414
I put a timeline together.

00:14.515 --> 00:15.949
I really think you should
look at the calendar.

00:16.049 --> 00:17.951
-Sabrina.
-How are you?

00:18.051 --> 00:19.186
All the better
after seeing you.

00:19.286 --> 00:20.521
Bitch, wasn't nobody
even talking to you.

00:20.621 --> 00:22.422
What are you?
Calvin!

00:22.523 --> 00:24.791
Here's my number.
You must call me.

00:24.892 --> 00:25.926
Danni, I'm a cop.

00:26.026 --> 00:28.428
-Hi.
-Hey, don't I know you?

00:28.529 --> 00:29.730
No, I don't think so.

00:29.830 --> 00:30.964
You look familiar.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.366
Sabrina needs to get a lawyer.

00:32.466 --> 00:35.469
This man bought me a fish bowl
to watch me in it.

00:35.569 --> 00:37.104
I got a call from a lawyer.

00:37.204 --> 00:39.206
He was asking a lot of questions
about you.

00:39.306 --> 00:43.076
I'm not gonna say a word,
if you have sex with me.

00:43.177 --> 00:45.145
I bought a ticket home.
Here.

00:45.245 --> 00:47.314
-I love you, Danni.
-Still on it.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.816
This right here,
he's off limits.

00:49.917 --> 00:51.618
Do you understand?

00:51.718 --> 00:53.754
-Are you okay, Karen?
-I'm just a little dizzy.

00:53.854 --> 00:55.389
You're bleeding.

00:55.489 --> 00:56.723
The bank is closed.

00:56.823 --> 00:57.991
You are under arrest
for conspiracy to

00:58.091 --> 00:59.259
commit bank robbery.

00:59.359 --> 01:00.460
Get 'em out of here.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.895
Does Danni know
you're doing this?

01:01.995 --> 01:02.930
[Maurice] Do you know him?

01:07.234 --> 01:08.535
What do you think that's about?

01:08.635 --> 01:11.071
I don't know, Andi, but I can't
stand his bitch ass.

01:11.170 --> 01:14.074
Okay. I won't worry about it.

01:14.174 --> 01:15.642
Don't.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.178
All right.
Let's get back to work.

01:18.277 --> 01:19.446
Okay.

01:19.545 --> 01:24.685
All right, so um, we were on the
Dexter-Jackson file.

01:24.785 --> 01:26.286
That's where we were at.

01:26.386 --> 01:28.055
Yeah.

01:30.023 --> 01:33.160
Um, hello.
Fatima.

01:34.661 --> 01:37.931
Girl, I'm trying to calm down.

01:38.031 --> 01:41.835
Well, what's going on now?

01:41.935 --> 01:44.438
You know, nothing makes
me madder than when a man

01:44.538 --> 01:46.707
calls a woman a bitch.

01:46.807 --> 01:48.008
I can understand that.

01:48.108 --> 01:51.011
Mm-hmm.

01:51.110 --> 01:53.947
Wait, who in their right mind
called you a bitch?

01:54.047 --> 01:55.682
-No man that's living.
-I know that's right.

01:55.782 --> 01:57.718
Yeah.

01:57.818 --> 02:01.054
Wait, then where is
this coming from?

02:02.189 --> 02:03.524
All right, you're
gonna make me say it.

02:03.624 --> 02:04.958
Yes.

02:05.058 --> 02:06.593
So Gary came in here today
and said he was here

02:06.693 --> 02:08.461
to see his lawyer.

02:08.562 --> 02:10.062
Okay.

02:10.163 --> 02:12.165
And I told him
that you were busy.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.034
Well, Fatima,
I'm not his lawyer.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.203
Right, right.
I know that.

02:16.303 --> 02:21.642
And proceeded to say
that bitch ain't my lawyer.

02:21.742 --> 02:25.512
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.

02:25.612 --> 02:27.581
He said that to you?

02:27.681 --> 02:30.551
That's what he said.

02:31.351 --> 02:34.221
Okay.
I got it.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.255
What?

02:35.355 --> 02:36.757
I'ma show him
what kind of bitch I am.

02:36.857 --> 02:38.225
Wait, Andi.
Hold on.

02:38.325 --> 02:40.727
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where are you going?

02:40.827 --> 02:41.828
Just give me a minute.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.430
Hold on, hold on.

02:43.530 --> 02:45.098
Fatima, now you know we're not
gonna fight in this office.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.433
Girl, I need to
take my earrings off.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.837
If you're about to confront him,
I needs to be ready.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.004
Oh, Lord.
Okay, fine.

02:51.103 --> 02:52.906
I'm coming with you.

02:59.179 --> 03:01.381

So how do you feel?

03:17.998 --> 03:19.466
Shit.

03:19.566 --> 03:20.901
What is it?

03:21.001 --> 03:23.203
My stomach is in knots.

03:23.303 --> 03:24.938
Do you want me to
go get the doctor?

03:25.038 --> 03:27.541
No. She said she'd be back.

03:27.641 --> 03:30.043
Okay.

03:30.143 --> 03:32.012
I don't know what's
taking her so long.

03:33.881 --> 03:34.982
Do you think it's bad news?

03:35.082 --> 03:37.651
No, I don't.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.119
How do you know, Pam?

03:39.219 --> 03:42.189
Because I think you
just need to relax.

03:42.289 --> 03:46.326
Oh, shit.
Oh my God, my life.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.496
I don't know what's going on.
Everything is just upside down.

03:49.596 --> 03:52.266
Yes, it is.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.203
But you're okay.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.572
No, I'm not.

03:58.672 --> 04:00.541
-Karen.
-Pam.

04:00.641 --> 04:02.576
Can I tell you something?

04:02.676 --> 04:03.944
What?

04:04.044 --> 04:07.047
Do you have any idea
how much I admire you?

04:07.147 --> 04:09.183
I think you're smart.

04:09.283 --> 04:11.652
You got your shit together.

04:11.752 --> 04:12.986
No, I don't.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.923
Well, maybe not
in the man department,

04:16.023 --> 04:19.259
but I do look up to you.

04:19.358 --> 04:23.764
And all of this,
it's all right.

04:23.864 --> 04:26.700
It really is.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.769
I don't feel like it is.

04:28.869 --> 04:33.073
Well, it is.

04:33.173 --> 04:34.875
Do you want me to call Aaron?

04:34.975 --> 04:36.909
-Pam.
-What?

04:37.010 --> 04:39.379
No, I don't want you
to call Aaron. Gosh.

04:39.479 --> 04:41.114
Oh.

04:41.215 --> 04:43.417
You want me to call Zac?

04:43.517 --> 04:44.918
Really Pam?

04:45.018 --> 04:46.186
I'm trying to help.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.721
I swear I'm not trying
to work your nerves.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.123
Okay, well, that's exactly
what you're doing right now.

04:50.224 --> 04:53.727
Okay. I'll just be quiet.

04:53.827 --> 04:55.462
Actually,

04:55.562 --> 04:57.397
can you just go
back to the salon?

04:57.497 --> 04:59.733
I'm not leaving you
here by yourself.

04:59.832 --> 05:01.969
I'm gonna be fine.

05:02.069 --> 05:04.004
At least let me call Andi
and the girls.

05:04.104 --> 05:08.675
No. Just go, please.
I'm fine.

05:08.775 --> 05:13.614
I will wait for you outside.

05:14.047 --> 05:17.618
[phone ringing]

05:26.793 --> 05:28.128
Hey, mama.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.998
[Lisa] Hey, baby.
Why do you sound like that?

05:31.098 --> 05:32.499
I'm on my way.

05:32.599 --> 05:33.534
What?

05:33.634 --> 05:35.969
[Lisa] Just tell
me where you are.

05:36.069 --> 05:38.972
Uh--

05:39.072 --> 05:41.275
I'm--

05:41.375 --> 05:42.843
I'm at the hospital.

05:42.943 --> 05:44.511
[Lisa] What happened?

05:44.611 --> 05:46.280
I'll tell you when
you get here.

05:46.380 --> 05:47.981
[Lisa] Are you sure
you're okay?

05:48.081 --> 05:49.650
Yeah, I am.

05:49.750 --> 05:50.918
[Lisa] I'm on my way.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.320
Okay.

05:58.457 --> 05:59.893
Can you believe
she's doing this shit?

05:59.993 --> 06:02.262
Yeah, I can.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.198
You can't trust
these bitches, bro.

06:04.298 --> 06:05.299
Hayden.

06:05.399 --> 06:07.100
I'm telling you,
I've had so many,

06:07.201 --> 06:08.569
believe me.

06:08.669 --> 06:11.338
They all like her.

06:11.438 --> 06:13.040
You've had a woman like Andi?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.441
Who do you think
you're talking to?

06:14.541 --> 06:16.643
You know how I get down, bro.
I'm a player out here.

06:16.743 --> 06:17.778
Come on now.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.314
The word player went out
in the 90s, Hayden.

06:20.414 --> 06:22.015
You know what I'm sayin'.

06:22.115 --> 06:24.718
Name one chick you
had as bad as Andi.

06:24.818 --> 06:27.387
-Fatima.
-Fatima?

06:27.487 --> 06:28.789
Yes.

06:28.889 --> 06:33.126
And help me out here, playa.
How long were y'all together?

06:33.227 --> 06:34.294
See all that don't matter.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.796
See you're getting
into details.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.264
-All that don't matter.
-No, no, no, no, no.

06:37.364 --> 06:40.734
Hayden, details matter.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.170
Gary, see we getting
a little distracted.

06:43.270 --> 06:46.306
This is about you
right now, right?

06:46.406 --> 06:48.909
Did you buy her a car?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.477
Nah, I ain't buy her no car.

06:50.577 --> 06:53.046
Did you buy her an apartment?

06:53.146 --> 06:54.381
I would never do that.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.082
What you trying to say?

06:56.183 --> 06:57.484
That's why we're here, brother.

06:57.584 --> 06:59.920
But trust me, I'm gonna get all
that back for you.

07:00.020 --> 07:04.291
And on top of that, we gonna
teach this bitch a lesson.

07:04.391 --> 07:06.193
And what bitch would that be?

07:06.293 --> 07:09.296
Excuse me.
I'm in a meeting.

07:09.396 --> 07:11.899
Hmm, that involves me.

07:11.999 --> 07:13.267
You can still leave.

07:13.367 --> 07:14.735
That's not happening.

07:14.835 --> 07:15.736
Really?

07:15.836 --> 07:18.071
Did you not hear
what she just said?

07:18.172 --> 07:19.540
Okay.

07:19.640 --> 07:21.441
See, if you keep it up,
you're going back to jail,

07:21.542 --> 07:23.310
so be real careful, all right?

07:23.410 --> 07:25.846
Hayden, I don't work for you.

07:25.946 --> 07:27.948
Excuse me you two.

07:28.048 --> 07:30.484
This involves me,

07:30.584 --> 07:32.286
so would someone like
to tell me what's going on?

07:32.386 --> 07:34.054
I'm suing you.

07:34.154 --> 07:36.356
-Gary.
-No, no, no.

07:36.456 --> 07:40.594
I'm suing you for the apartment
and the car.

07:40.694 --> 07:43.597
-Gary...
-And pain and suffering.

07:43.697 --> 07:46.466
-And distress.
-And distress.

07:46.567 --> 07:48.936
Andi.

07:49.036 --> 07:51.305
It's okay.
I got this.

07:51.405 --> 07:53.507
This -- talkin' about
pain and suffering

07:53.607 --> 07:55.642
after all the shit
he done put you through.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.945
All the shit I done
put her through?

07:58.045 --> 08:00.047
Mother--,
are you delusional?

08:00.147 --> 08:03.650
Fatima, please do something in
here, so I can take your job.

08:03.750 --> 08:06.320
Please.

08:06.420 --> 08:09.823
Andi, please.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.025
Please let me shoot this
mother-- just one time.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.327
-Please.
-No.

08:13.427 --> 08:15.762
You need to get her
up out of my office.

08:15.863 --> 08:18.365
- --
-Please don't provoke her.

08:18.465 --> 08:21.602
Okay?
Fatima.

08:21.702 --> 08:24.338
Fatima.

08:24.438 --> 08:28.709
Fatima, hello.
Hey, Fatima.

08:28.809 --> 08:32.111
Could, could you just step out
of the office just momentarily?

08:32.212 --> 08:34.548
Both of y'all go outside.

08:35.414 --> 08:38.318
Please. I got this.

08:40.888 --> 08:42.923
-I got it.
-Okay.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.726
Cool 'cause I'm sick of
both of these --.

08:45.826 --> 08:46.727
Okay.

08:46.827 --> 08:47.694
Bye.

08:47.794 --> 08:48.795
-- you!

08:48.896 --> 08:51.665
[door slams]

09:08.148 --> 09:10.951
So you're suing me?

09:11.051 --> 09:13.921
Yeah.

09:19.059 --> 09:21.628
I'm sorry.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.164
What's so funny?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.469
You don't want me, Gary.

09:30.003 --> 09:32.372
And I don't want you.

09:34.540 --> 09:37.477
So why are we doing this?

09:38.779 --> 09:39.847
-Andi--
-Is it because you think

09:39.947 --> 09:41.782
I'm a bitch?

09:41.882 --> 09:43.550
Because you told Fatima
I was a bitch

09:43.650 --> 09:45.319
and you let Hayden
call me a bitch.

09:45.419 --> 09:47.087
-I did not.
-You did.

09:47.187 --> 09:50.023
I just--

09:50.123 --> 09:52.426
You just what?

09:52.526 --> 09:56.430
You wanna hurt me?

09:56.530 --> 09:58.198
Is that what you want?

09:58.298 --> 10:01.935
-Look--
-Because you hurt me enough.

10:04.571 --> 10:08.809
Suing me for
pain and suffering?

10:10.644 --> 10:15.115
You bought the penthouse, so you
could watch my every move.

10:15.215 --> 10:19.853
You bought me all those things,
so that you can control me.

10:19.953 --> 10:21.588
That's not true.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.157
It is.

10:25.158 --> 10:27.694
I want to talk about this.

10:28.695 --> 10:29.897
You wanna talk about this?

10:29.997 --> 10:32.366
Mm-hmm.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.602
Well, I'm talking
with my lawyer.

10:35.702 --> 10:38.906
And as his lawyer,
you need to leave.

10:40.540 --> 10:43.010
I think you should leave.

10:46.647 --> 10:48.849
Look at me, Gary.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.518
Look at me.

10:51.852 --> 10:54.421
You can't, can you?

10:57.224 --> 11:00.494
We're wrong for each other.

11:00.594 --> 11:03.564
You know that.
I know that.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.466
Hey, what are you doing?

11:06.567 --> 11:09.937
What, what, what do you want?
You want--

11:10.037 --> 11:11.939
You want the penthouse
and you want the car.

11:12.039 --> 11:12.906
Is that it?

11:13.006 --> 11:16.109
You're damn right.

11:18.946 --> 11:21.481
I can defend this.

11:21.582 --> 11:24.952
And I will win.

11:26.053 --> 11:29.056
You put everything in my name.

11:32.526 --> 11:35.696
And what you didn't do
was pay the taxes on it

11:35.796 --> 11:39.233
and that's fine.
I did that.

11:39.333 --> 11:41.902
But you also put me in a bind.

11:42.002 --> 11:45.339
I sold my old place.
I have nowhere to go.

11:46.373 --> 11:49.676
You gave it to me
'cause you said you loved me.

11:55.382 --> 11:58.218
That's fine.

11:58.318 --> 12:02.122
I'll give you everything back.

12:03.423 --> 12:06.760
How about you just
refund me the tax monies

12:06.860 --> 12:10.063
for the property and the car,

12:10.163 --> 12:13.133
and we call it a truce?

12:13.233 --> 12:16.203
Is that fair, Gary?

12:18.705 --> 12:21.475
Is that fair?

12:26.346 --> 12:28.615
Hayden, can I talk
to her for a second?

12:28.715 --> 12:30.751
-Bro.
-Please just--

12:30.851 --> 12:34.221
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

12:34.922 --> 12:37.391
All right.

12:50.938 --> 12:53.340
What are you doing?

12:53.440 --> 12:55.609
Look, I don't know
what you did to me.

12:55.709 --> 12:59.780
What does that even mean?

12:59.880 --> 13:03.150
Nobody makes me
crazier than you.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.686
Nobody makes me
happier than you.

13:05.786 --> 13:10.858
I mean, nobody -- me
or -- me over like you do.

13:11.491 --> 13:13.560
Oh, shit. I don't even know how
I got to do to let you go,

13:13.660 --> 13:16.363
but I--

13:16.463 --> 13:20.200
Listen, I know this is bad.

13:20.300 --> 13:24.238
And I know we don't match,
but Andi--

13:24.338 --> 13:28.108
I just, I don't know.
I just--

13:31.778 --> 13:36.016
Baby, sometimes--

13:36.116 --> 13:40.254
People are just wrong
for each other.

13:40.354 --> 13:43.123
No matter how bad they want it.

13:43.223 --> 13:46.226
And no matter what
they do for it.

13:47.928 --> 13:50.130
Is he that much better than me?

13:50.230 --> 13:51.999
What are you talking about?

13:52.099 --> 13:54.401
This--
This Robin dude.

13:54.501 --> 13:58.639
It's not about Robin.
It's about us.

13:58.739 --> 14:01.575
You and me.

14:03.277 --> 14:07.247
What is this?
What are we doing?

14:07.347 --> 14:08.749
What are we doing?

14:08.849 --> 14:11.518
Baby--

14:12.219 --> 14:15.389
This is the end.

14:15.789 --> 14:17.724
We're over.

14:20.394 --> 14:22.763
You don't want to admit it,

14:22.863 --> 14:24.698
but you know it.

14:24.798 --> 14:27.668
I know it.

14:27.768 --> 14:30.537
It's over.

14:35.776 --> 14:40.414
Can you say that?
Can you say that it's over?

14:42.049 --> 14:44.318
We're over.

14:46.687 --> 14:49.289
I'm gonna be fair.

14:49.389 --> 14:52.526
I'm gonna give you
everything back.

14:55.896 --> 14:58.532
I never wanted any of it.

14:58.632 --> 15:01.835
I just wanted you.

15:02.169 --> 15:04.938
That's all I wanted.

15:08.141 --> 15:10.410
I know.

15:12.646 --> 15:15.516
I'll call the realtor tomorrow.

15:19.453 --> 15:22.322
You can have everything.

15:25.125 --> 15:27.461
All right.

15:31.365 --> 15:34.868
Look, just so you know--

15:35.435 --> 15:39.473
Please, no more sorries.

15:40.774 --> 15:43.410
No more.

16:06.200 --> 16:07.868
[line ringing]

16:07.968 --> 16:10.337
-Hey.
-Hey.

16:10.437 --> 16:11.972
So what happened?

16:12.072 --> 16:13.073
We got 'em.

16:13.173 --> 16:15.409
-[Que] We did?
-Yeah, we did.

16:15.509 --> 16:17.477
So are they gonna let me walk?

16:17.578 --> 16:19.112
Yeah, they gonna let you walk.

16:19.213 --> 16:20.514
Okay, great.

16:20.614 --> 16:23.016
But, D-A is gonna need you to
testify in court.

16:23.116 --> 16:24.184
[Que] Okay.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.286
Okay, so you need
to get a damn job.

16:26.386 --> 16:28.288
Man, how am I gonna do that?

16:28.388 --> 16:30.090
Just look like a good witness.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.192
You don't have a record,
so get a damn job

16:32.292 --> 16:33.794
and stay out of trouble.

16:33.894 --> 16:36.496
I will,
but can you help me with that?

16:36.597 --> 16:39.032
Damn. I gotta help
you with everything?

16:39.132 --> 16:40.601
I'm sorry.

16:40.701 --> 16:43.637
Okay, look.
I'll call you tomorrow.

16:43.737 --> 16:46.273
I think I might have somebody
that might hook you up.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.741
And you better
be there on time.

16:47.841 --> 16:49.309
And do the damn job.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.346
-I will.
-Okay.

17:00.254 --> 17:01.421
What the hell are
you doing here?

17:01.522 --> 17:04.458
What do you mean?

17:04.558 --> 17:05.959
And where's Maurice?

17:06.059 --> 17:07.728
I don't know.

17:07.828 --> 17:09.863
Well, I don't know what
you got going on,

17:09.963 --> 17:12.299
but you can't stay here.

17:12.398 --> 17:13.834
I just can't get up
and leave, Calvin.

17:13.934 --> 17:17.171
I don't care.
You can't stay here.

17:17.271 --> 17:21.675
Well, Maurice already
said I can.

17:21.775 --> 17:22.976
You know what?

17:23.076 --> 17:24.411
I'm moving my shit out of here.

17:24.511 --> 17:26.113
I can't do this.

17:26.213 --> 17:29.783
-Well, maybe you should.
-I am.

17:31.084 --> 17:33.921
Look, um, I cooked.

17:34.555 --> 17:37.324
-Say what?
-Yeah, check it out.

17:39.927 --> 17:40.761
It does look good.

17:40.861 --> 17:43.997
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
Just for you.

17:44.097 --> 17:46.466
What are you up to?

17:46.567 --> 17:48.468
Man, look, I'm just here to help
you and Maurice out.

17:48.569 --> 17:51.038
Nah, nah, nah.
You up to something.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.507
I'm not.

17:53.607 --> 17:54.474
Before you start scoopin'
all that shit,

17:54.575 --> 17:56.310
did you wash your hands?

17:56.410 --> 17:59.947
Of course.
It's clean.

18:00.414 --> 18:03.584
-Look, just eat.
-All right, well.

18:03.684 --> 18:05.018
Eat.

18:05.118 --> 18:06.920
I'll take a little.

18:07.020 --> 18:10.424
That's all you want?

18:11.558 --> 18:14.127
I'm talkin' about the food.

18:14.228 --> 18:16.897
Yeah, okay.

18:16.997 --> 18:18.365
Why are you doing this?

18:18.465 --> 18:20.734
What do you mean?

18:20.834 --> 18:23.036
Forget it.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.973
Look, just eat.

18:26.440 --> 18:28.108
Why do I keep getting
this call?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.643
From who?

18:29.743 --> 18:32.012
I keep getting a call
from the correction institute.

18:32.112 --> 18:33.580
Really?

18:33.680 --> 18:36.550
Yeah and the only criminal I
know is standin' right here.

18:36.650 --> 18:38.585
Well, I won't be calling you.

18:38.685 --> 18:41.121
Nah, that's how you used
to call Maurice.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.457
Yeah, that's all--
Come on.

18:43.557 --> 18:44.525
Here's your plate.
Sit down.

18:44.625 --> 18:45.759
I got it.
I got it.

18:45.859 --> 18:46.894
Just go ahead and enjoy, man.

18:46.994 --> 18:47.594
I need a fork.

18:47.694 --> 18:50.531
I got you.
Here.

18:50.864 --> 18:52.466
Go ahead and sit down
and enjoy your meal.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.568
Is that the fork you
just put in your mouth?

18:54.668 --> 18:56.537
Yeah, but you know,
we're roommates.

18:56.637 --> 19:01.008
Nah, we're not roommates.
I'll get my own fork.

19:10.384 --> 19:11.785
Hey, baby.

19:11.885 --> 19:14.321
Mama.

19:14.922 --> 19:17.424
-I messed up.
-Oh, sweetheart.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.093
Oh, it's okay, baby,
whatever it is.

19:20.194 --> 19:22.162
Come on.
Sit down.

19:22.262 --> 19:24.164
Okay.

19:25.132 --> 19:28.735
Whatever it is,
it'll be fine.

19:28.836 --> 19:30.537
You don't even know
what it is yet.

19:30.637 --> 19:35.309
I can guess.

19:35.409 --> 19:37.444
I'm pregnant.

19:40.147 --> 19:42.449
And I was bleeding at work.

19:42.549 --> 19:43.784
What did the doctor say?

19:43.884 --> 19:45.586
I don't know.
I'm waiting for her.

19:45.686 --> 19:47.054
Do you want me to go get her?

19:47.154 --> 19:49.289
No. She's been in here twice.

19:49.389 --> 19:52.860
They just keep running tests.

19:52.960 --> 19:54.695
Mama, I'm scared.

19:54.795 --> 19:57.397
What are you scared for?

19:57.497 --> 19:58.966
I want this baby.

19:59.066 --> 20:03.504
Okay. Then happy thoughts.
We're gonna have a baby.

20:03.604 --> 20:05.772
It's just--

20:05.873 --> 20:08.108
What?

20:08.208 --> 20:11.144
And where's the baby daddy?

20:11.245 --> 20:16.250
Well, um--
I didn't call him.

20:16.350 --> 20:18.819
Why not?

20:19.286 --> 20:20.454
Let me call Zac right now.

20:20.554 --> 20:23.023
No, mama.

20:23.123 --> 20:28.495
I don't know
100% that it's his.

20:30.731 --> 20:33.267
Oh.

20:33.367 --> 20:35.169
Okay.

20:35.869 --> 20:41.408
So um, it might be his
or--

20:41.508 --> 20:43.377
The accountant?

20:43.477 --> 20:46.180
-He's not an accountant.
-Oh, honey.

20:46.280 --> 20:48.482
It's all starting
to make sense.

20:48.582 --> 20:49.516
What is?

20:49.616 --> 20:52.152
Why you're so stressed out.

20:52.252 --> 20:54.588
I know, but I can't stop.

20:54.688 --> 20:57.291
Why not?

20:57.391 --> 21:01.295
Zac has moved on

21:01.395 --> 21:04.631
and he's in love
with someone else.

21:04.731 --> 21:07.401
Okay.

21:07.501 --> 21:08.969
What?

21:09.069 --> 21:13.740
Oh, but babe,
you still love Zac.

21:13.841 --> 21:15.709
I don't wanna.

21:15.809 --> 21:20.948
Oh, honey, it's just not that
easy to forget him overnight,

21:21.048 --> 21:23.383
not with all you've
gone through.

21:23.483 --> 21:25.352
Shit, I still love your father.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.321
Not that I'd ever
want him back.

21:27.421 --> 21:33.260
No. You know, when we were
together he was just young,

21:33.360 --> 21:35.929
dumb, doing stupid
things all the time.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.297
I became the adult.

21:37.397 --> 21:39.166
I was the one that had
to make sure there was

21:39.266 --> 21:42.002
a roof over our heads
and food on the table.

21:42.102 --> 21:44.338
I couldn't wait to get
rid of him and when I did,

21:44.438 --> 21:48.375
oh my God.
It was fabulous.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.678
Then he met that other woman
and suddenly became

21:51.778 --> 21:54.515
very responsible and became
the man I always wanted him

21:54.615 --> 21:57.317
to be with us.

21:57.417 --> 21:58.852
And the tough part for me was

21:58.952 --> 22:02.222
that now she was reaping the
benefits of all my hard work.

22:02.322 --> 22:06.493
And baby, that pissed
me the -- off.

22:06.593 --> 22:09.129
But I wouldn't have
it any other way now.

22:09.229 --> 22:11.665
And I know you love Zac,

22:11.765 --> 22:15.402
but you gotta take all that love
that you've got going

22:15.502 --> 22:20.607
and put it into making
that little nugget work.

22:20.707 --> 22:25.145
-What if he's the father?
-What if he is?

22:25.245 --> 22:26.847
I'm gonna have to
see him all the time.

22:26.947 --> 22:29.583
Oh my God, Christmas.

22:29.683 --> 22:31.618
-What?
-Christmas.

22:31.718 --> 22:34.922
When you were a little girl,
every Christmas,

22:35.022 --> 22:37.691
the day after, you'd start
talking about what you wanted

22:37.791 --> 22:39.593
for Christmas next year.

22:39.693 --> 22:41.061
It drove me crazy.

22:41.161 --> 22:44.498
And I would always
say to you, baby...

22:44.598 --> 22:47.301
Be thankful
and enjoy what you have now.

22:47.401 --> 22:48.902
Don't look so far ahead.

22:49.002 --> 22:53.173
Exactly.
This is Christmas.

22:53.273 --> 22:56.076
You gotta stop worrying what's
gonna happen next week,

22:56.176 --> 23:01.915
next month,
next year.

23:02.015 --> 23:05.719
-I'm trying.
-Well, mommy's here.

23:05.819 --> 23:08.689
I'm gonna make you try
just a little bit harder.

23:08.789 --> 23:10.190
Gosh.

23:10.290 --> 23:12.526
Oh, sweetheart.

23:16.263 --> 23:17.931
-Hey, Linda.
-Hey.

23:18.031 --> 23:18.932
I'm about to get out of here.

23:19.032 --> 23:20.434
All right.

23:20.534 --> 23:21.902
This one right here is
gonna go to fourth circuit.

23:22.002 --> 23:23.804
Perfect. Okay.

23:23.904 --> 23:25.305
These will go to Judge Bracket.

23:25.405 --> 23:27.341
All right.
Judge Bracket.

23:27.441 --> 23:28.775
And the rest of
these are gonna go out.

23:28.876 --> 23:30.677
All right. Perfect.
You want me to run these over?

23:30.777 --> 23:32.346
Oh, no. Just get a messenger.
It's fine.

23:32.446 --> 23:34.781
-Okay. Perfect.
-Thanks.

23:34.882 --> 23:36.650
-Hey, girl.
-Hey.

23:36.750 --> 23:37.885
Are you okay?

23:37.985 --> 23:39.186
Yeah.

23:39.286 --> 23:41.154
What happened?

23:41.255 --> 23:43.724
How about we talk
about that later?

23:43.824 --> 23:47.861
Okay. Well, um, do you need
anything else before I--

23:47.961 --> 23:49.596
Well, I was already
getting out of here, but--

23:49.696 --> 23:51.431
No, I don't need anything.
I'ma leave with you.

23:51.532 --> 23:52.432
Okay.

23:52.533 --> 23:54.968
But where are you
rushing off to?

23:55.068 --> 23:56.537
My man.

23:56.637 --> 24:01.508
Oh. Look at you.
It's the glow for me.

24:01.608 --> 24:05.846
Andi, I'm telling you.
I love going home to him.

24:08.248 --> 24:11.185
One day I wanna say that.

24:11.285 --> 24:13.053
Andi, you're gonna find love.
You will.

24:13.153 --> 24:14.755
Oh, I got love.

24:14.855 --> 24:19.359
I need a good,
non-toxic variation of love.

24:19.459 --> 24:20.727
It's preferred.

24:20.827 --> 24:22.162
Yeah. I know.

24:22.262 --> 24:24.698
Um, what is he doing here?

24:24.798 --> 24:29.403
Uh. I don't know.
What are you doing here?

24:29.503 --> 24:31.538
-Hey Zac.
-What's up?

24:31.638 --> 24:32.539
Are you done?

24:32.639 --> 24:33.874
I am, but what are
you doing here?

24:33.974 --> 24:35.375
You better be. I'm trying to
take you to dinner.

24:35.475 --> 24:36.844
-Oh.
-Oh, really?

24:36.944 --> 24:38.178
You see me.
You see me.

24:38.278 --> 24:39.780
I see you.
That's cute.

24:39.880 --> 24:41.215
I see you.

24:41.315 --> 24:42.716
So is she ready to go?

24:42.816 --> 24:44.918
Yeah, I am.

24:45.018 --> 24:46.253
Bye, girl.

24:46.353 --> 24:47.888
No, nah-uh-uh.
I got more work for you to do.

24:47.988 --> 24:51.792
I'm just kidding.
Go have fun.

24:53.227 --> 24:54.461
Oh, shit.

24:54.561 --> 24:55.863
Okay, you want to
explain this to me?

24:55.963 --> 24:59.032
How is this criminal at
my place of business?

24:59.132 --> 25:00.400
I'm leaving, bro.

25:00.501 --> 25:02.903
Come on, baby.
Come on.

25:03.003 --> 25:05.739
-Bye, girl.
-Bye, girl.

25:06.173 --> 25:07.441
See, that shit ain't right.

25:07.541 --> 25:09.409
You know I got a restraining
order on him, right?

25:09.510 --> 25:10.444
Hayden, let this go.

25:10.544 --> 25:11.845
Nah, I ain't letting shit go.

25:11.945 --> 25:14.781
Robin told you to let it go.
You should let it go.

25:14.882 --> 25:16.884
Okay?
Get a life.

25:16.984 --> 25:18.919
This shit ain't over.

25:21.288 --> 25:22.289
Get me a car.

25:22.389 --> 25:24.825
Yes, sir.
Coming right up.

25:28.095 --> 25:32.132
Shit.
No, don't tell me shit.

25:32.232 --> 25:34.101
What is the delay?

25:34.201 --> 25:35.502
There was weather, ma'am,

25:35.602 --> 25:38.172
but your flight is gonna be here
at the gate shortly.

25:38.272 --> 25:39.973
Y'all -- suck.

25:40.073 --> 25:42.075
Well, we sure are sorry, ma'am.

25:42.176 --> 25:43.477
--, you can't
get me first class?

25:43.577 --> 25:44.711
Are you really
saying this to me?

25:44.811 --> 25:46.380
What? Shit.

25:46.480 --> 25:49.016
Look, this is exactly
why we didn't work out.

25:49.116 --> 25:52.786
No. We didn't work out 'cause
your black ass is broke.

25:52.886 --> 25:54.221
You know what?

25:54.321 --> 25:57.157
Excuse me, we don't actually
need to sit next to each other.

25:57.257 --> 25:58.625
You know.

25:58.725 --> 26:01.128
I agree with you completely, but
this flight is sold out.

26:01.228 --> 26:03.664
Bitch, you can find us a seat.

26:03.764 --> 26:05.232
Chill.

26:05.332 --> 26:06.834
No, -- you.

26:06.934 --> 26:08.769
I should've flown
with another airline.

26:08.869 --> 26:11.672
Well, there are plenty here.
There's Silver Winds.

26:11.772 --> 26:14.408
What? You know,
what did you just say?

26:14.508 --> 26:16.376
-Ma'am?
-No, bitch.

26:16.476 --> 26:17.978
-Julie, Julie.
-I want you fired.

26:18.078 --> 26:19.179
Excuse me.

26:19.279 --> 26:20.681
Yeah, where is your
damn supervisor?

26:20.781 --> 26:21.915
Okay.

26:22.015 --> 26:23.150
Chill that shit, all right?

26:23.250 --> 26:26.720
No. I want her ass fired.

26:26.820 --> 26:27.754
I'm-I'm sorry.

26:27.855 --> 26:30.057
My supervisor will
be here shortly.

26:30.157 --> 26:32.392
If there's anything you can do.

26:32.492 --> 26:34.194
I'll talk to my supervisor

26:34.294 --> 26:37.264
and I'll see what
she can do for you.

26:37.364 --> 26:40.067
What's takin' so long, bitch?

26:40.167 --> 26:44.571
Ma'am, have you been drinking?

26:44.671 --> 26:46.373
-What?
-I think you have.

26:46.473 --> 26:49.510
I can kind of smell it
and you know, unfortunately

26:49.610 --> 26:52.513
we won't be able to
accomodate you today.

26:52.613 --> 26:54.081
Wait, wait, whoa, hey.
Wait, wait.

26:54.181 --> 26:55.382
I am getting on that plane!

26:55.482 --> 26:57.851
Oh, unfortunately ma'am,
I don't think you are.

26:57.951 --> 26:59.253
Are you serious?

26:59.353 --> 27:02.689
Wait. I'm sorry. Look, we,
we're trying to get to our son.

27:02.789 --> 27:04.791
He's at camp
and he broke his leg.

27:04.892 --> 27:08.629
Please, please.

27:08.729 --> 27:13.267
You know, ma'am, if you would
kindly sit your ass over there

27:13.367 --> 27:15.769
and be quiet,
I'll see what I can do.

27:15.869 --> 27:17.871
Go ahead and sit your
ass down, please.

27:17.971 --> 27:19.973
Here, take the bag.

27:21.275 --> 27:22.376
She's lovely.

27:22.476 --> 27:25.012
-Oh, she is.
-Thank you.

27:25.112 --> 27:27.147
Mm-hmm.

27:35.222 --> 27:37.191
He bought me some flowers.

27:40.827 --> 27:43.597
-Hey.
-Hey, Aaron.

27:43.697 --> 27:46.800
-Is Karen here?
-No.

27:46.900 --> 27:48.001
I've been calling her.

27:48.101 --> 27:50.537
So you decided to just pop up?

27:50.637 --> 27:52.906
I mean, she usually returns my
calls at this point.

27:53.006 --> 27:54.474
Well, she ain't here.

27:54.575 --> 27:56.577
Okay, well, did she tell you
where she was going?

27:56.677 --> 27:58.946
Uh-uh.

28:01.815 --> 28:04.151
Hey Karen, I just want to make
sure you're doing okay.

28:04.251 --> 28:05.452
I've been calling you.

28:05.552 --> 28:08.055
Call me back when you
get this please.

28:11.825 --> 28:14.261
Uh, what are you doing?

28:14.361 --> 28:15.863
I'm just gonna sit here
and wait for her.

28:15.963 --> 28:17.831
Not right there you ain't.

28:17.931 --> 28:19.233
Why not?

28:19.333 --> 28:21.802
I'm about to close
this place up and go home.

28:21.902 --> 28:25.138
Okay. I mean, that's okay
I could just-

28:25.239 --> 28:28.175
-Okay.
-Thank you.

28:30.444 --> 28:32.746
-Pam.
-What?

28:32.846 --> 28:34.314
What's going on?

28:34.414 --> 28:38.585
If she wanted you to know where
she is, she would tell you.

28:38.685 --> 28:40.287
Okay, fine.

28:40.387 --> 28:43.090
Give a girl some
breathing room.

28:43.190 --> 28:48.896
I mean, you are fine,
but you ain't all that.

28:49.296 --> 28:51.632
Or did you play
football or something?

28:51.732 --> 28:52.933
Really?

28:53.033 --> 28:54.501
-Did you really say that?
-You heard me.

28:54.601 --> 28:56.036
Would you just have
her call me, please?

28:56.136 --> 28:59.339
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

29:00.774 --> 29:02.943
-Hey, Andi.
-Hi, Aaron.

29:03.043 --> 29:05.145
-How are you?
-I'm great.

29:05.245 --> 29:09.483
-Good.
-Good and just leaving.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.653
Have you talked to Karen today?

29:12.753 --> 29:14.254
No, that's why I'm here.

29:14.354 --> 29:17.157
She's not answering her phone
and I wanted to know why.

29:17.257 --> 29:18.792
So you don't know where she is?

29:18.892 --> 29:21.295
No.

29:21.395 --> 29:23.096
Can I talk to you in her office
for a second?

29:23.197 --> 29:24.565
Not in there.

29:24.665 --> 29:26.066
It's okay, one second.
We won't even be that long.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.301
No, no, no, no.

29:27.401 --> 29:29.636
Just really quickly.
Really quickly.

29:36.844 --> 29:39.379
What's going on?

29:39.479 --> 29:41.782
Is Karen okay?

29:41.882 --> 29:43.884
Yeah, she's fine.

29:43.984 --> 29:46.520
Okay. Do you know
what's going on?

29:46.620 --> 29:50.657
She is my best friend, Aaron.
She tells me everything.

29:50.757 --> 29:54.962
Okay, so you know that she's not
sure who the father is?

29:55.062 --> 29:57.497
Of course. I'm aware of that.

29:57.598 --> 29:59.766
I mean, I just want to be
there for her, you know?

29:59.867 --> 30:02.703
Aaron, Karen is the type of
woman who when she needs

30:02.803 --> 30:05.772
her space, she takes it.

30:05.873 --> 30:10.210
So the more you push her, the
more she's gonna push you away.

30:10.310 --> 30:12.012
So you think I
should step away?

30:12.112 --> 30:14.281
No, that's not what I'm saying.

30:14.381 --> 30:16.383
I just wanted to give you a
better idea

30:16.483 --> 30:20.387
of how Karen copes with things.

30:21.188 --> 30:23.790
I'm just so confused.

30:23.891 --> 30:26.126
So is she.

30:31.031 --> 30:33.100
Does she still love Zac?

30:33.200 --> 30:34.568
Oh, yeah, no.

30:34.668 --> 30:38.772
I am not going to talk to you
about him or that at all.

30:38.872 --> 30:40.307
I get that.

30:40.407 --> 30:42.576
I'm just looking
for some good advice.

30:42.676 --> 30:46.346
Kind of like the
advice you gave Gary?

30:46.446 --> 30:47.447
What?

30:47.548 --> 30:50.217
Aaron, did you tell
Gary to sue me?

30:50.317 --> 30:52.553
Uh, no, I did not.

30:52.653 --> 30:55.923
What did you tell him?

30:56.023 --> 30:57.524
I don't want to
break his confidence,

30:57.624 --> 31:00.127
but I definitely
did not tell him that.

31:00.227 --> 31:04.831
Do you want more advice
about Karen or not?

31:07.968 --> 31:09.536
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay, look.

31:09.636 --> 31:12.606
All I'm gonna say is that he
really, really loves you, Andi.

31:12.706 --> 31:14.474
I know that.

31:14.575 --> 31:17.911
And I think you love him, too.

31:18.512 --> 31:20.814
You know what I've learned?

31:20.914 --> 31:24.051
Is that you can love someone,

31:24.151 --> 31:27.054
but not need or have them.

31:27.154 --> 31:29.523
Look, I know that
Gary has his issues.

31:29.623 --> 31:34.962
I just, he really
is a great guy, Andi.

31:35.062 --> 31:39.833
That great guy called
me a bitch today.

31:39.933 --> 31:41.535
At my job.

31:41.635 --> 31:44.004
Okay, well,
that's disrespectful.

31:44.104 --> 31:45.506
I'm not condoning that.

31:45.606 --> 31:47.708
I guess what I'm saying is,
if he's not reacting

31:47.808 --> 31:51.578
from his anger like that,

31:51.678 --> 31:53.046
he's a good guy.

31:53.146 --> 31:54.615
Yeah, the problem
with that statement

31:54.715 --> 31:57.751
is that he's always
reacting from his anger.

31:57.851 --> 32:00.254
He's angry a lot.

32:00.354 --> 32:02.956
Look, have you ever talked
to him when he's calm

32:03.056 --> 32:04.925
and really heard him out?

32:05.025 --> 32:06.326
I have.

32:06.426 --> 32:09.096
Has he told you
about his mother?

32:09.196 --> 32:11.231
I know about his mother.

32:11.331 --> 32:13.233
And he's told you everything?

32:13.333 --> 32:14.601
I'm sorry.

32:14.701 --> 32:17.271
Are you insinuating
that he gets permission

32:17.371 --> 32:19.239
to be an asshole
because of all those things?

32:19.339 --> 32:20.607
No, no, no, no.

32:20.707 --> 32:22.309
No, there's no excuse
for being an asshole.

32:22.409 --> 32:23.844
I'm not saying that.

32:23.944 --> 32:25.379
-Okay.
-Again, I don't condone-

32:25.479 --> 32:26.947
-What are you saying?
-Those actions.

32:27.047 --> 32:30.484
I'm just saying that if you got
to know his past more maybe you

32:30.584 --> 32:33.387
could understand him better.

32:33.487 --> 32:35.889
I think it's too late for that.

32:35.989 --> 32:36.957
I understand that.

32:37.057 --> 32:40.561
Have a good evening, Aaron.

32:40.661 --> 32:43.463
Good evening, Andi.
And hey, could--

32:43.564 --> 32:46.667
If you talk to Karen, can
you please have her call me?

32:46.767 --> 32:48.135
I will.

32:48.235 --> 32:51.238
-Thank you.
-No problem.

32:58.912 --> 33:01.114
-Bye, Pam.
-Bye, Aaron.

33:01.215 --> 33:03.317
-Bye, Andi.
-Bye, Aaron.

33:03.417 --> 33:04.918
Girl, he got it bad.
He ain't even call.

33:05.018 --> 33:06.386
He just popped up.

33:06.486 --> 33:08.222
-Pam.
-Hmm.

33:08.322 --> 33:11.291
-Where is Karen?
-I don't know.

33:11.391 --> 33:13.994
You are lying.

33:14.094 --> 33:16.463
I told you I don't know.

33:16.563 --> 33:18.899
Pam!

33:18.999 --> 33:20.300
Okay, look.

33:20.400 --> 33:22.703
I do know, but she don't
want me to tell nobody.

33:22.803 --> 33:24.171
What the hell, Pam?

33:24.271 --> 33:26.440
-I'm sorry.
-Well, is she okay?

33:26.540 --> 33:29.443
Yes.

33:29.743 --> 33:31.845
You know what?

33:37.317 --> 33:39.219
Karen, I have been
calling you all day

33:39.319 --> 33:41.388
and you are not
picking up the phone.

33:41.488 --> 33:43.156
I'm standing in front of Pam

33:43.257 --> 33:45.292
and she's not
telling me anything.

33:45.392 --> 33:49.363
Call me back asap.
I'm starting to get worried.

33:53.233 --> 33:55.335
I'ma remember that.

33:55.435 --> 33:57.104
-Andi.
-You know what that means.

33:57.204 --> 33:59.873
What does that mean?

33:59.973 --> 34:03.977
Andi.
I like your suit.

34:04.077 --> 34:06.580
-[Andi] Girl!
-And your shoes!

34:10.717 --> 34:12.920
Babe, what are we doing?

34:13.020 --> 34:15.322
We doing this.

34:15.422 --> 34:18.625
We are in the middle
of a parking lot.

34:18.725 --> 34:21.428
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

34:21.527 --> 34:22.696
Look, what are we doing?

34:22.795 --> 34:24.598
We here.

34:25.966 --> 34:27.668
-Here.
-Here.

34:27.768 --> 34:29.203
What?

34:29.303 --> 34:34.208
This spot right here is where
my whole life changed.

34:34.308 --> 34:36.777
Oh, the night I hit you
on the bike.

34:36.877 --> 34:39.146
Yes. Yes.

34:39.246 --> 34:43.717
Oh, wow.
Yeah, that was right here.

34:43.817 --> 34:44.751
You don't, you don't get it?

34:44.851 --> 34:46.186
No.

34:46.286 --> 34:51.757
Imagine walking through,
okay, riding through life

34:51.859 --> 34:55.829
and getting smacked
by the most beautiful,

34:55.929 --> 34:59.967
non-driving ass woman
in the whole world?

35:00.067 --> 35:04.304
In a truck.
And your whole life changed.

35:04.404 --> 35:05.339
Zac.

35:05.439 --> 35:06.306
Think about it.

35:06.406 --> 35:08.742
If I'd have been
one minute later--

35:08.842 --> 35:11.111
Yeah, well,
I was running late that day.

35:11.211 --> 35:15.048
Okay, so imagine
if you was on time.

35:15.148 --> 35:16.517
Hmm.

35:16.617 --> 35:18.652
We would've never met.

35:18.752 --> 35:20.654
Yeah.

35:20.754 --> 35:23.824
-But baby.
-What's up?

35:23.924 --> 35:27.361
-You been smokin'?
-No, I ain't--

35:27.461 --> 35:29.696
No, I ain't been smokin',
Fatima.

35:29.796 --> 35:31.498
Okay, so what, what,
what's going on?

35:31.598 --> 35:32.633
I'm just tryin' to--

35:32.733 --> 35:36.303
Fatima, I--

35:36.403 --> 35:39.439
I ain't never loved
a woman like you before.

35:39.540 --> 35:42.509
I ain't never even met
a woman like you before.

35:42.609 --> 35:46.079
And I don't know what God did

35:46.180 --> 35:50.250
to make me deserve
to be with you.

35:50.350 --> 35:52.319
Oh, babe.

35:52.419 --> 35:53.520
No and just--

35:53.620 --> 35:57.057
-No, seriously.
-Stop it.

35:57.157 --> 35:58.959
-Okay, so-
-Keep it coming.

35:59.059 --> 36:02.763
If I -- up
or if you -- up.

36:02.863 --> 36:04.097
I ain't gonna -- up.

36:04.198 --> 36:06.667
Can we, it's my moment.
Can I have my moment?

36:06.767 --> 36:09.236
Okay, I'm sorry.
I'll be quiet.

36:09.336 --> 36:10.704
Go ahead.

36:10.804 --> 36:13.140
If things ever get bad

36:13.240 --> 36:17.144
and we feel like we can't get
back to each other's hearts,

36:17.244 --> 36:20.781
promise me,
we can always come back here.

36:20.881 --> 36:23.951
Yes.

36:24.051 --> 36:27.020
I love you.

36:29.423 --> 36:30.624
-Zac.
-Yes.

36:30.724 --> 36:32.025
That is so sweet.

36:32.125 --> 36:34.127
-Is it really?
-Yes.

36:34.228 --> 36:37.164
Why are you telling me
all the right things?

36:37.264 --> 36:41.034
I just love you.
Close your eyes.

36:41.134 --> 36:44.738
Close your eyes.
Come on, close your eyes.

36:44.838 --> 36:47.140
Okay.

36:47.508 --> 36:51.345
I want you to think about
the type of man

36:51.445 --> 36:53.847
you want to spend the rest
of your life with.

36:53.947 --> 36:55.849
And I want you to know

36:55.949 --> 37:01.488
that I'm gonna do everything in
my power to be better than him.

37:01.588 --> 37:04.057
-He looks like Idris.
-He look like who?

37:04.157 --> 37:05.359
-I mean--
-Keep playing with me.

37:05.459 --> 37:07.261
Keep--you see?
You see you playing around?

37:07.361 --> 37:08.495
I'm joking,
I'm joking.

37:08.595 --> 37:09.796
I'm trying to have
a romantic moment.

37:09.897 --> 37:11.298
I know. I'm joking, baby.

37:11.398 --> 37:13.367
Look, I don't need to close
my eyes to know what I want.

37:13.467 --> 37:15.002
-No?
-No.

37:15.102 --> 37:18.372
You are literally all
the man that I want.

37:18.472 --> 37:23.243
Stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come on, stop.

37:23.343 --> 37:26.747
You are literally all
the man that I want and need.

37:26.847 --> 37:28.315
Okay?

37:28.415 --> 37:29.716
-I love you.
-I love you, too.

37:29.816 --> 37:31.685
Stop playing with me or I'll
take you home right now.

37:31.785 --> 37:32.619
Come on, come on.

37:32.719 --> 37:34.955
Uh-uh.

37:35.055 --> 37:35.956
What?

37:36.056 --> 37:37.291
-Zac.
-Come on.

37:37.391 --> 37:38.926
-I'm trying to go home-
-This was the date?

37:39.026 --> 37:40.427
Are you trying to
take me home now?

37:40.527 --> 37:41.962
Fati--you bee--I been tryin to
have this moment with you.

37:42.062 --> 37:42.930
You've been killing
this moment.

37:43.030 --> 37:44.097
I'm trying to be romantic.

37:44.198 --> 37:45.299
You taking all the
romance out of it.

37:45.399 --> 37:46.767
-I'm hungry.
-You're always hungry.

37:46.867 --> 37:48.168
Are you going
to take me to eat?

37:48.268 --> 37:49.870
I'm going to take you to eat.
Can you change clothes

37:49.970 --> 37:51.271
-so I can take you to eat?
-Come on.

37:51.371 --> 37:52.840
-Girl, you're just a hungry--
-I done worked all day.

37:52.940 --> 37:54.241
I get it,
but I'm trying to be romantic.

37:54.341 --> 37:55.642
You can't let a --
be romantic?

37:55.742 --> 37:57.678
That was sweet.
That was sweet. That was sweet.

38:00.781 --> 38:03.684
All right. Be ready to
take off all your clothes.

38:03.784 --> 38:04.918
What?

38:05.018 --> 38:06.386
You have to be
stripped searched.

38:06.486 --> 38:09.590
No.
I haven't even done anything.

38:09.690 --> 38:12.392
Is that your real hair?

38:12.759 --> 38:14.027
It's faux locks.

38:14.127 --> 38:15.796
Can you take them out?

38:15.896 --> 38:17.764
What?

38:17.865 --> 38:20.400
Lady, are you hard of hearing?

38:20.501 --> 38:23.136
No. You know this is a process.

38:23.237 --> 38:25.572
Okay, then,
can you take them out?

38:25.672 --> 38:27.374
It's hard.

38:27.474 --> 38:29.276
If you can't take them out,
then we'll cut them out.

38:29.376 --> 38:30.777
What?
I need a lawyer.

38:30.878 --> 38:32.212
I need to talk to somebody.

38:32.312 --> 38:33.947
Look, Lady, we've
got other inmates.

38:34.047 --> 38:35.315
I'm not an inmate!

38:35.415 --> 38:37.618
As of now, you are an inmate.

38:37.718 --> 38:38.886
No. I'm not doing this.

38:38.986 --> 38:40.187
I haven't even done
anything wrong.

38:40.287 --> 38:41.922
I need to talk to my lawyer now!

38:42.022 --> 38:44.458
I am not in the mood for this
or any of your foolishness.

38:44.558 --> 38:47.027
Now we can do this the easy way
or the hard way.

38:47.127 --> 38:48.595
All I'm saying is,
I need--

38:48.695 --> 38:52.466
Officer Jack and Mims,
we have an unruly prisoner.

38:52.566 --> 38:54.067
I am not unruly.

38:54.168 --> 38:55.602
You are not doing what I'm
telling you to do,

38:55.702 --> 38:56.970
therefore you are unruly.

38:57.070 --> 38:58.372
I don't wanna hear it.

38:58.472 --> 39:00.207
I didn't even do anything.
I just--

39:00.307 --> 39:03.343
Take her.
She will not do it on her own.

39:03.443 --> 39:06.813
What? Well, hold on a second.
Ma'am, ma'am!

39:06.914 --> 39:07.881
And that's not her real hair.

39:07.981 --> 39:10.751
Ma'am!
You know--

39:12.786 --> 39:14.521
Sabrina, call me.

39:14.621 --> 39:16.490
I've been tryin'
to talk to you, girl.

39:16.590 --> 39:17.658
I've been tryin' to call you.

39:17.758 --> 39:19.493
Danni.

39:21.995 --> 39:25.465
-Danni.
-I thought you were gone.

39:25.566 --> 39:30.137
I thought I was, too,
but I thought about something.

39:30.237 --> 39:32.606
What's that?

39:32.706 --> 39:35.175
I love you, Danni.

39:37.511 --> 39:38.612
Okay.

39:38.712 --> 39:41.048
I know I messed up
and I got some bad advice,

39:41.148 --> 39:43.650
but I truly love you.

39:46.153 --> 39:47.654
Just I'm--

39:47.754 --> 39:52.526
I know you feel something
for me, too, Danni.

39:53.961 --> 39:55.362
Preston.
It's just right now.

39:55.462 --> 39:59.867
Listen,
I have to tell you something.

39:59.967 --> 40:03.704
I was dating this
girl named Mindy.

40:03.804 --> 40:06.206
Okay.

40:06.540 --> 40:09.309
Mindy's not really sounding
like a black-girl name, but--

40:09.409 --> 40:13.447
No. Danni, she's not.
We--

40:15.449 --> 40:19.119
I needed to take a break.

40:19.219 --> 40:21.088
We met in elementary school
and then we dated

40:21.188 --> 40:22.623
for a really long time.

40:22.723 --> 40:25.592
I just needed to see
what else was out there.

40:25.692 --> 40:30.831
And I know that she was hurt
by that, but I needed that.

40:31.498 --> 40:35.969
Okay. You're sharing this
just to--

40:36.069 --> 40:40.908
That's because I didn't think
it was important until now.

40:41.008 --> 40:42.609
Why is this important now?

40:42.709 --> 40:46.747
Just--
Hear me out.

40:50.484 --> 40:55.322
Danni, she loves me
like no woman ever has.

40:56.523 --> 41:00.394
And I've just been out
here running after you.

41:01.862 --> 41:04.565
So I'm going home.

41:04.665 --> 41:08.702
And I'm gonna take her
to that same playground,

41:10.070 --> 41:12.439
that same elementary school.

41:12.539 --> 41:15.742
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

41:16.743 --> 41:20.814
That's beautiful.
Congratulations.

41:21.615 --> 41:24.585
Unless you tell me not to.

41:24.685 --> 41:25.819
Okay.

41:25.919 --> 41:29.156
Unless you tell me

41:29.256 --> 41:32.326
that you don't want
me to do that.

41:32.426 --> 41:35.929
And that's what
I'm gonna do, Danni.

41:36.930 --> 41:40.000
Just tell me you don't
want me to do that.

41:49.810 --> 41:51.612
[Danni] Next on "Sistas".

41:51.712 --> 41:53.013
Did Pam call you?

41:53.113 --> 41:53.780
No.

41:53.881 --> 41:54.781
Nobody knows I'm here.

41:54.882 --> 41:56.149
Karen, come on.

41:56.250 --> 41:57.584
-[Karen] Hi, Fatima.
-Zac, talk to this girl.

41:57.684 --> 41:59.620
No, you a low-down
bitch for that.

41:59.720 --> 42:01.154
Now you're worrying me.

42:01.255 --> 42:03.257
I had a friend who said
they were being investigated

42:03.357 --> 42:04.191
at the bank.

42:04.291 --> 42:06.693
-Investigated?
-For the robbery.

42:06.793 --> 42:08.028
If this baby is mine,

42:08.128 --> 42:09.429
we're gonna have to
figure this shit out.

42:09.530 --> 42:11.365
Why don't you just go on home?

42:13.133 --> 42:14.101
Andi.

42:14.201 --> 42:15.769
Oh my God!
