00:58.591 --> 01:02.288
<i>What is it that makes a man a man?</i>

01:02.629 --> 01:06.087
<i>Is it his origins,
the way things start?</i>

01:06.299 --> 01:10.429
<i>Or is it something else,
something harder to describe?</i>

01:10.804 --> 01:14.331
<i>For me, it all began in 1944.</i>

01:14.507 --> 01:17.738
<i>Classified mission
off the coast of Scotland.</i>

01:18.244 --> 01:20.303
<i>The Nazis were desperate.</i>

01:20.480 --> 01:22.948
<i>Combining science and black magic...</i>

01:23.116 --> 01:26.517
<i>...they intended to upset
the balance of the war.</i>

01:26.920 --> 01:32.153
<i>I was 28, already a paranormal
advisor to President Roosevelt.</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:36.885
<i>I could never have suspected
that what would transpire that night...</i>

01:37.063 --> 01:40.089
<i>...would not only affect
the course of history...</i>

01:40.300 --> 01:42.962
<i>...but change my life forever.</i>

01:43.136 --> 01:44.694
All right, men, let's go. Move!

01:50.643 --> 01:52.873
Come on! Come on! Come on!

01:53.947 --> 01:55.175
Let's fan it out.

02:01.321 --> 02:02.686
Your men...

02:02.856 --> 02:04.790
...they'll need these.

02:07.660 --> 02:09.025
Are you a Catholic?

02:09.195 --> 02:12.631
Yes. Among other things.
But that's hardly the point.

02:12.799 --> 02:14.664
Well, you're gonna need
one of these.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.230
I abhor the use of violence.

02:17.804 --> 02:21.069
Thank you. I wouldn't want you
to think me mad, Sergeant Whitman.

02:21.241 --> 02:23.801
No, three days too late for that,
Professor Broom.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.140
All right, you guys,
let's move, move, move, move!

02:31.951 --> 02:33.885
Come on boys, let's go!

02:34.053 --> 02:35.577
This way! Left, right!

02:35.755 --> 02:37.723
Come on, men, let's get the lead out!

02:37.891 --> 02:38.880
We're close!

02:39.058 --> 02:42.391
You're wasting our time. There's
nothing here but sheep and rocks.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.496
- Ruins, not rocks.
- Hold it right here!

02:44.664 --> 02:48.122
The remains of Trondham Abbey,
built on an intersection of ley lines...

02:48.301 --> 02:50.394
...the boundaries between
our world and the others...

02:50.570 --> 02:52.504
What a load of crap!

02:52.739 --> 02:55.902
Hell, a week ago, I never even heard
the word "parabnormal. "

02:56.075 --> 02:57.372
Paranormal.

02:57.544 --> 02:59.136
Move it!

03:00.580 --> 03:01.911
Hold the line.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.775
Come on!

03:09.489 --> 03:11.480
Sweet Jesus.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.626
They must be here for the sheep.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.339
The freak in the gas mask...

03:38.518 --> 03:40.986
Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

03:41.754 --> 03:46.453
Hitler's top assassin
and head of the Thule Occult Society.

03:47.827 --> 03:50.728
If he's here, this is worse
than I thought.

04:15.788 --> 04:18.017
No matter what happens tonight...

04:18.190 --> 04:21.183
...this book will guide you
back to me.

04:21.361 --> 04:23.352
I will not leave you.

04:25.198 --> 04:28.361
I grant you everlasting life...

04:28.601 --> 04:29.727
...youth...

04:29.902 --> 04:32.996
...and the power to serve me.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.306
Ilsa! Grigori!

04:38.044 --> 04:39.033
It's time.

04:50.156 --> 04:53.091
Five years of research
and construction, Grigori.

04:53.259 --> 04:54.556
Five years!

04:54.727 --> 04:57.059
The fÃ¼hrer doesn't look kindly
on failure.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.926
There will be no failure, general.

05:00.300 --> 05:03.030
I promised Herr Hitler a miracle.

05:05.938 --> 05:08.099
I'll deliver one.

05:17.817 --> 05:21.020
What I will do tonight
can never be undone!

05:21.187 --> 05:23.280
I will open a portal...

05:23.790 --> 05:26.315
...and awaken the Ogdru Jahad:

05:26.492 --> 05:29.188
The Seven Gods of Chaos!

05:29.696 --> 05:32.460
Our enemies will be destroyed!

05:32.632 --> 05:34.793
And from the ashes...

05:35.568 --> 05:39.334
...a new Eden will arise.

07:04.023 --> 07:05.718
Get down!

07:08.928 --> 07:10.088
I was taking a picture.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.891
You do that again
and I'll carve you a new one.

07:13.065 --> 07:15.295
Listen, the portal is open.

07:15.468 --> 07:18.528
Do you understand?
We have to stop them.

07:50.269 --> 07:51.736
Go! Go! Go! Go!

08:03.983 --> 08:05.485
Look out!

08:50.196 --> 08:51.493
Get down!

09:35.708 --> 09:37.232
It's almost over.

09:37.410 --> 09:38.877
No, it's not.

09:41.280 --> 09:43.373
The portal's been open for too long.

09:43.549 --> 09:45.710
Something may have come through.

09:45.885 --> 09:48.877
Have your men search
the area thoroughly.

09:51.924 --> 09:54.222
Spread out over that way!

09:57.964 --> 10:00.694
Sir! Something up here!

10:02.635 --> 10:04.364
He's gone.

10:04.537 --> 10:06.505
For now.

10:08.641 --> 10:11.701
When you said something
came through...

10:12.078 --> 10:13.943
From where?

10:18.751 --> 10:20.616
I don't see them!

10:26.792 --> 10:31.024
Do you really, really believe in hell?

10:32.632 --> 10:35.465
There is a place,
a dark place...

10:35.635 --> 10:39.662
...where ancient evil slumbers
and waits to return.

10:39.839 --> 10:43.002
- Grigori gave us a glance tonight.
- Grigori?

10:43.342 --> 10:45.776
That's Russian, right?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.277
Grigori Efimovich Rasputin.

10:48.447 --> 10:49.539
Rasputin?

10:49.715 --> 10:53.151
- Come on!
- Occult adviser to the Romanovs.

10:53.319 --> 10:56.117
In 1916, at a dinner in his honor...

10:56.288 --> 11:01.191
...he was poisoned, shot,
stabbed, clubbed...

11:01.394 --> 11:04.386
...castrated and finally drowned.

11:04.563 --> 11:07.964
And yet, we saw him here tonight.

11:09.168 --> 11:10.192
Professor Broom.

11:14.306 --> 11:16.137
Careful. Be careful.

11:39.498 --> 11:41.591
- What the hell is that? An ape?
- No.

11:41.767 --> 11:44.292
It was red. Bright red.

11:44.470 --> 11:46.438
Lower your light, you're scaring it.

11:47.506 --> 11:50.270
- What are you two shooting at?
- A red ape!

11:50.443 --> 11:52.968
No, it's not an ape.

11:54.113 --> 11:55.978
It's got a big stone in its hand.

11:56.148 --> 11:59.049
I think that is its hand.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.448
Look at the size of that whammer.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.422
No, wait! Wait!

12:38.557 --> 12:41.492
A blanket. Get me a blanket.

12:45.431 --> 12:48.628
Come on. Come on. It's safe.

12:48.934 --> 12:49.958
Jump down.

12:50.136 --> 12:52.400
Come on. Jump down.

12:57.076 --> 12:58.737
It's a boy.

12:59.945 --> 13:01.845
It's just a baby boy.

13:08.988 --> 13:10.080
Move to the left.

13:10.256 --> 13:15.523
<i>There we were, an unready father
for an unwanted child.</i>

13:16.395 --> 13:19.193
<i>The boys gave him a name
that very night.</i>

13:19.365 --> 13:22.630
<i>In retrospect,
perhaps not the most fortunate.</i>

13:22.802 --> 13:26.568
<i>But nevertheless,
a name we all came to use.</i>

13:26.772 --> 13:30.208
<i>We called him Hellboy.</i>

13:33.279 --> 13:34.712
Look at the birdie.

13:47.226 --> 13:48.887
<i>Speculation about the origins...</i>

13:55.134 --> 13:56.396
<i>Evidence that Hellboy...</i>

14:10.182 --> 14:12.776
<i>So, what is it exactly
that you say this agency does?</i>

14:14.553 --> 14:16.248
<i>I kid you not. It hunts monsters.</i>

14:24.230 --> 14:26.357
<i>The claim, of course,
that this creature...</i>

14:26.532 --> 14:28.693
<i>...works for the FBI
as a monster hunter.</i>

15:04.370 --> 15:07.339
What you seek is in there.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.656
This is a sacred place.

16:10.302 --> 16:11.496
Give me my gold.

16:13.772 --> 16:14.932
We shouldn't be here.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.896
Master.

17:16.068 --> 17:18.093
Your eyes.

17:19.704 --> 17:22.970
What did they do to your eyes?

17:27.413 --> 17:30.348
- Have you told him yet?
- No.

17:31.450 --> 17:32.576
We should.

17:41.760 --> 17:44.228
Malignant sarcoma.

17:45.030 --> 17:46.657
In the lungs...

17:47.933 --> 17:49.730
...the spine...

17:49.902 --> 17:52.700
...liver.
- Approximately...

17:53.539 --> 17:57.270
...how long?
- Maybe six weeks.

17:57.443 --> 18:02.403
I can arrange for hospitalization
and pain management.

18:02.581 --> 18:06.779
- Make the time more bearable.
- No.

18:06.952 --> 18:09.250
I'd rather be at home.

18:09.788 --> 18:13.121
I have some arrangements to make.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.655
For my son.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.625
You can always get
a second opinion.

18:23.635 --> 18:26.126
That won't be necessary.

18:31.610 --> 18:32.634
Hurry up!

18:33.479 --> 18:35.413
- Hurry up!
- Wait right here!

18:36.915 --> 18:39.975
<i>Tom Manning is the head
of special operations at the FBI.</i>

18:40.152 --> 18:43.883
<i>He joins Pat in the studio tonight
to go over the latest Hellboy sighting.</i>

18:44.056 --> 18:46.889
There. That's the tail.

18:47.059 --> 18:49.050
And these are the horns.

18:49.228 --> 18:50.354
I have a question.

18:52.998 --> 18:56.593
In the pictures of aliens, UFO,
the yeti, Hellboy...

18:56.768 --> 18:59.566
...why is it they're always out of focus?

19:00.539 --> 19:01.665
<i>Why don't you tell us...</i>

19:01.840 --> 19:04.775
<i>...about the Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense?</i>

19:04.943 --> 19:08.003
I wanna tell you, I wanna tell
the American public one thing.

19:08.180 --> 19:09.841
Now, this Bureau for the...

19:10.015 --> 19:13.109
Paranormal Research and Defense.

19:14.720 --> 19:19.623
There is no such thing.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.740
"Waste Management Services"?

19:40.312 --> 19:41.506
<i>What is it?</i>

19:42.047 --> 19:44.709
John Myers, FBI.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.078
Transfer from Quantico.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.547
<i>Look at the birdie, son.</i>

20:11.410 --> 20:15.608
- Hello. I'm John...
- You are late. That's what you are.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.274
- Five minutes.
- Yes, I know.

20:18.450 --> 20:22.682
- I'm going to...
- Section 51. I know.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.248
Watch your hands and elbows.

20:25.424 --> 20:27.915
- Pardon?
- Watch your hands and elbows.

20:55.654 --> 20:56.882
Hello?

21:03.762 --> 21:06.492
Turn the pages, please,
if you don't mind.

21:11.270 --> 21:12.771
Please.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.773
The pages.

21:15.274 --> 21:16.525
These? You're reading these?

21:16.560 --> 21:19.778
Four books at once, every day...

21:20.779 --> 21:22.781
...as long as I'm there
to turn the pages.

21:23.282 --> 21:24.650
My name's Broom.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.411
Professor Trevor Broom.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.574
Sir, I'm John...

21:27.753 --> 21:30.119
Agent John T. Myers,
Kansas City, '76.

21:30.289 --> 21:32.587
T stands for Thaddeus,
mother's older brother.

21:32.758 --> 21:34.953
Scar on your chin happened
when you were 10.

21:35.127 --> 21:37.960
You still wonder if it's ever
going to fade away.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.893
- How did it...?
- He.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.194
Not "it. "

21:43.402 --> 21:45.393
Abraham Sapien.

21:46.571 --> 21:49.131
Discovered alive
in a secret chamber...

21:49.308 --> 21:52.141
...of St. Trinian's
Foundling Hospital, Washington.

21:52.311 --> 21:54.438
His name was taken
from this inscription...

21:54.613 --> 21:57.207
...stuck to the side of his tank.
- "Icthyo Sapiens.

21:57.382 --> 21:59.942
April 14, 1865."

22:00.218 --> 22:02.914
The day that Abraham Lincoln died.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.487
Hence, Abe Sapien.

22:06.892 --> 22:08.189
Rotten eggs.

22:09.561 --> 22:11.893
A delicacy. Abe loves them.

22:12.064 --> 22:14.157
How does he know
so much about me?

22:14.333 --> 22:17.564
Abe possesses a unique frontal lobe.

22:18.937 --> 22:23.271
"Unique. " That's a word you'll hear
frequently around here.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.976
Sir, where am I, exactly?

22:29.948 --> 22:32.678
As you entered the lobby,
there was an inscription:

22:32.851 --> 22:37.447
"In the absence of light,
darkness prevails. "

22:38.156 --> 22:41.023
There are things that go bump
in the night, Agent Myers.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.785
Make no mistake about that.

22:43.195 --> 22:47.359
And we are the ones
who bump back.

22:50.602 --> 22:54.868
1937, Hitler joins
the Thule Society...

22:55.073 --> 22:58.770
...a group of German aristocrats
obsessed with the occult.

22:58.944 --> 23:03.313
1938, he acquired
the Spear of Longinus...

23:03.482 --> 23:05.313
...which pierced the side of Christ.

23:05.484 --> 23:07.577
He who holds it becomes invincible.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.620
Hitler's power increases tenfold.

23:10.789 --> 23:14.589
1943, President Roosevelt
decides to fight back.

23:14.793 --> 23:17.887
The Bureau of Paranormal
Research and Defense is born.

23:18.230 --> 23:21.563
1958, the Occult Wars
finally come to an end...

23:21.733 --> 23:24.224
...with the death of Adolf Hitler.

23:24.903 --> 23:27.565
1945, you mean.

23:27.906 --> 23:29.396
Hitler died in '45.

23:30.776 --> 23:32.107
Did he, now?

23:34.846 --> 23:37.576
Myers, this is Agent Clay.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.114
Take his lead.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.283
He'll make the introductions.

23:45.457 --> 23:47.015
You're not coming?

23:47.926 --> 23:52.829
I handpicked you from a roster of over
70 academy graduates.

23:52.998 --> 23:54.590
Make me proud.

23:55.801 --> 23:57.598
They're not speaking.

23:58.336 --> 24:00.236
Professor Broom had him grounded.

24:00.405 --> 24:02.737
Grounded? Who's grounded?

24:11.917 --> 24:14.408
Okay. You saw the fish guy, right?

24:14.586 --> 24:16.747
Oh, yeah. That was weird.

24:17.155 --> 24:18.622
Yeah. Right.

24:25.931 --> 24:29.230
Well, come on in.
Meet the rest of the family.

24:30.202 --> 24:31.635
He gets fed six times a day.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.327
He's got a thing for cats.

24:33.505 --> 24:36.440
You'll be his nanny,
his keeper, his best friend.

24:36.908 --> 24:39.274
He never goes out unsupervised.

24:39.444 --> 24:40.433
Who?

24:46.985 --> 24:48.247
I hate those comic books.

24:49.788 --> 24:51.449
They never get the eyes right.

24:57.429 --> 24:58.953
Hellboy.

24:59.764 --> 25:00.753
He's real.

25:00.932 --> 25:04.368
60 years old by our count.
But he doesn't age like we do.

25:04.536 --> 25:07.903
Think reverse dog years.
He's barely out of his 20s.

25:08.073 --> 25:09.472
What's with the hair, Clay?

25:10.075 --> 25:11.804
Finally got them implants, huh?

25:13.512 --> 25:14.979
It'll fill in.

25:15.413 --> 25:16.641
Who's the squirt?

25:17.449 --> 25:19.644
Agent Myers is your new liaison.

25:22.687 --> 25:23.984
I don't want him.

25:25.156 --> 25:27.317
What, you get tired of me, Clay?

25:27.926 --> 25:29.860
The candy. Give him the candy.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.121
Oh, sir, I...

25:32.297 --> 25:34.128
I have these for you.

25:35.534 --> 25:36.660
Father's back?

25:38.403 --> 25:41.429
- He still angry?
- Well, you did break out.

25:41.606 --> 25:42.800
I wanted to see her.

25:43.275 --> 25:46.802
- Nobody's business.
- It is. You got yourself on TV again.

25:47.145 --> 25:48.806
Myers, huh?

25:49.180 --> 25:51.546
You got a first name, Myers?

25:51.716 --> 25:54.446
Try not to stare.
He hates it when people stare.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.022
John. John Myers.

25:58.189 --> 26:00.123
Well, John'll do.

26:00.292 --> 26:04.456
- Stare at what?
- His horns. He files them to fit in.

26:13.004 --> 26:14.369
What you looking at, John?

26:16.474 --> 26:19.739
Oh, no, no, no. Nothing.
Nothing at all.

26:19.911 --> 26:21.242
<i>Code red.</i>

26:21.413 --> 26:22.402
Hey, hey, hey.

26:22.581 --> 26:23.912
<i>Warning. Code red.</i>

26:24.082 --> 26:25.447
They're playing our song.

26:25.850 --> 26:29.183
Come on, champ,
let's go fight some monsters.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.395
We're here at the Machen Library...

26:37.562 --> 26:40.326
...where just hours ago,
an alarm was triggered.

26:40.498 --> 26:43.433
The N.Y.P.D. has yet
to issue a statement.

26:43.602 --> 26:47.038
We've got SWAT vans, paramedics.
You name it.

26:47.205 --> 26:49.298
And now here comes
a garbage truck.

26:49.474 --> 26:51.465
A large garbage truck.

26:54.946 --> 26:56.538
Look at them ugly suckers, Blue.

26:56.715 --> 26:59.343
One sheet of glass
between them and us.

26:59.517 --> 27:01.314
Story of my life.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.946
Outside.
I could be outside.

27:07.292 --> 27:10.022
You mean, outside with her.

27:10.195 --> 27:12.459
Don't get psychic with me, fella.

27:12.631 --> 27:14.496
Nothing psychic about it.

27:14.866 --> 27:16.163
You're easy.

27:16.334 --> 27:19.303
How am I gonna get a girl?
I drive around in a garbage truck.

27:21.272 --> 27:22.739
Liz left us, Red.

27:23.208 --> 27:24.675
Take the hint.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.743
We don't take hints.

27:36.221 --> 27:38.189
Civilians in bedroom.

28:00.578 --> 28:02.569
Okay, guys,
let's sync up our locators.

28:07.285 --> 28:10.152
Seal the doors.
Red and Blue are coming in.

28:11.189 --> 28:13.453
1900 hours, an alarm was tripped.

28:13.625 --> 28:17.061
A large entity, type 5, reported.
Very aggressive.

28:17.228 --> 28:18.388
Six guards dead.

28:18.563 --> 28:20.360
I thought we checked this place.

28:20.532 --> 28:21.999
Fakes and reproductions.

28:22.167 --> 28:24.965
Apparently, not everything was fake.

28:27.839 --> 28:29.204
Father.

28:36.081 --> 28:38.242
The entity is still in there.

28:38.416 --> 28:43.319
Video surveillance shows
a 16th-century statue was destroyed.

28:43.621 --> 28:45.680
St. Dionysius the Areopagite.

28:45.857 --> 28:48.621
- Who wards off demons.
- Exactly.

28:49.694 --> 28:53.061
The statue, however, was hollow.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.331
A reliquary.

28:55.900 --> 28:57.265
A prison.

28:57.435 --> 29:00.666
The Vatican deemed its occupant
dangerous enough...

29:00.839 --> 29:05.435
...to include it on The List of Avignon,
of which, by the way, we hold a copy.

29:05.610 --> 29:07.874
Perfect job for these babies.

29:08.079 --> 29:09.603
Made them myself.

29:10.014 --> 29:14.246
Holy water, clove leaf, silver
shavings, white oak. The works.

29:18.590 --> 29:21.923
Behind this door, a dark entity.

29:22.727 --> 29:26.493
Evil, ancient and hungry.

29:26.664 --> 29:30.532
Oh, well.
Let me go in and say hi.

29:59.864 --> 30:01.798
<i>You better hit the books,
Brother Blue.</i>

30:01.966 --> 30:04.992
<i>We'll definitely need
more info on this one.</i>

30:05.170 --> 30:07.331
Hey, no one goes with him? Jesus.

30:07.505 --> 30:09.871
No. He likes it that way.

30:10.041 --> 30:13.408
The whole "lonely hero" thing.

30:28.459 --> 30:30.324
Hey, Stinky.

30:32.797 --> 30:34.424
Kitchen's closed.

30:35.066 --> 30:36.556
What you having?

30:37.168 --> 30:40.228
Six library guards, raw,
plus belts and boots.

30:40.405 --> 30:44.569
Man, you're gonna need
some heavy fiber to move that out.

30:44.742 --> 30:46.607
<i>Red, I found something.</i>

30:47.045 --> 30:49.809
This entity's name is Sammael,
the desolate one.

30:49.981 --> 30:51.710
Son of Nergal, brother of...

31:05.196 --> 31:06.754
Listen, Sammy...

31:07.265 --> 31:11.292
...I'm not a very good shot, but The
Samaritan here uses really big bullets.

31:19.978 --> 31:23.812
So, what do you say we work this out
in a nice, peaceful...

31:25.250 --> 31:26.649
Oh, crap.

31:38.863 --> 31:41.161
That's it for you, Sam.

31:43.635 --> 31:46.297
<i>Red, you need to hear
the rest of the information.</i>

31:46.638 --> 31:48.731
No, he's taken care of.

31:48.907 --> 31:50.841
No, listen to this.

31:51.342 --> 31:55.210
"Sammael, the desolate one,
lord of the shadows...

31:55.380 --> 31:58.315
<i>...son of Nergal,
hound of resurrection... "</i>

32:01.319 --> 32:03.082
See...

32:03.254 --> 32:04.551
...I don't like that.

32:04.722 --> 32:06.553
<i>What? Hound of resurrection?</i>

32:07.558 --> 32:10.186
<i>"Harbinger of pestilence.
Seed of destruc... "</i>

32:10.361 --> 32:12.727
Cut to the end. How do I kill it?

32:12.897 --> 32:14.262
<i>Doesn't say.</i>

32:20.371 --> 32:22.032
Go to the front. Let's go! Move!

32:22.206 --> 32:23.833
I'm going around the back.

32:46.531 --> 32:48.226
Oh, crap.

32:48.399 --> 32:50.196
Child.

32:51.803 --> 32:53.668
All grown up, I see.

32:54.806 --> 32:56.569
That voice.

32:57.275 --> 33:00.369
It was the first lullaby
you ever heard, my son.

33:00.545 --> 33:03.070
I ushered you into this world.

33:03.247 --> 33:07.013
I alone know your true calling,
your true name.

33:07.685 --> 33:09.084
Name this.

33:28.906 --> 33:31.773
- That thing. That thing.
- What do you think you're doing?

33:31.943 --> 33:34.503
- What do you think you're doing?
- Helping you. L...

33:34.679 --> 33:36.271
Nobody helps me!

33:36.447 --> 33:37.880
It's my job.

33:41.953 --> 33:44.547
You want to help? Here.
Load this.

33:47.692 --> 33:49.694
It's a tracking bullet. Crack the pin.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.699
Jesus, what's that on your arm?

33:55.199 --> 33:56.200
Oh, crap.

34:01.939 --> 34:03.804
What the hell is that thing?

34:04.409 --> 34:05.899
Let me go ask.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.429
All right, keep coming.
Good. Keep coming.

34:34.138 --> 34:35.469
Why, you little...

34:55.460 --> 34:56.654
Wait!

35:00.098 --> 35:01.793
We're heading toward civilians.

35:12.910 --> 35:15.674
Crazy costumes, huh?
Trick or treat.

35:45.209 --> 35:46.608
Red means stop!

35:59.423 --> 36:02.017
- You all right?
- Yeah.

36:02.193 --> 36:04.286
Stay here.

36:15.106 --> 36:18.542
Sammy, you got a leak.

36:25.082 --> 36:27.778
Waiting for me, chunk-face?

36:33.457 --> 36:34.947
What the...?

37:10.528 --> 37:12.655
- I'm on your side.
- Sure.

37:18.603 --> 37:19.968
That's right!

37:42.560 --> 37:44.323
Open wide!

37:49.066 --> 37:50.055
Son of a...

37:54.772 --> 37:55.864
Yuck!

37:56.540 --> 37:57.871
Screw this.

38:12.290 --> 38:14.087
I'm fireproof.

38:14.892 --> 38:16.860
You're not.

38:24.769 --> 38:25.758
Hey, Myers.

38:26.504 --> 38:28.199
Yeah? Yeah? Yeah?

38:28.372 --> 38:30.033
<i>How's your arm?</i>

38:30.207 --> 38:33.267
Yeah, my arm's fine.
Where are you?

38:33.444 --> 38:35.412
I just fried Stinky.

38:35.579 --> 38:37.240
Listen...

38:37.515 --> 38:39.039
...tell Father I'll be home...

38:39.216 --> 38:40.649
<i>...but he shouldn't wait up.</i>

38:40.818 --> 38:42.217
No. No, wait, wait.

38:42.386 --> 38:43.819
<i>Yeah, I gotta go with you.</i>

38:43.988 --> 38:46.548
- Hey, Myers.
- Yeah?

38:48.626 --> 38:50.355
Bye.

38:52.663 --> 38:54.392
Damn it.

40:07.772 --> 40:11.105
Sammael has fulfilled his destiny.

40:11.742 --> 40:13.903
Die in peace...

40:14.078 --> 40:17.514
...and be reborn again and again.

40:22.686 --> 40:25.951
Only seven more days
till the eclipse.

40:26.123 --> 40:30.253
The child will be there,
and so will we all.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.323
Won't we?

41:21.512 --> 41:23.810
There's a big, red man down there.

41:23.981 --> 41:26.848
That's fine, darling.
Santa's not here for another month.

41:27.017 --> 41:28.780
Not Santa.

41:28.953 --> 41:30.716
Well, who, then?

41:41.765 --> 41:43.528
I brought beer.

41:43.901 --> 41:45.835
Oh, Red, your arm.

41:47.538 --> 41:49.529
You better get that looked at.

41:56.981 --> 41:58.209
I wanted to see you.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.476
Every time the media gets
a look at him, they run to me.

42:26.644 --> 42:28.236
I'm running out of lies, Trevor.

42:28.412 --> 42:30.972
- I thought you like being on TV.
- I do.

42:31.282 --> 42:34.843
So how many escapes
this year alone? Five.

42:35.019 --> 42:37.249
Tom, he's our guest, not a prisoner.

42:37.421 --> 42:41.653
Your guest is 6-foot-5, bright red,
has a tail and is government-funded.

42:41.825 --> 42:43.190
I know where to find him.

42:43.661 --> 42:46.323
- I'll get him back.
- Hey, fish stick.

42:46.630 --> 42:47.790
Don't touch anything.

42:47.965 --> 42:50.160
I need to touch it to see.

42:50.334 --> 42:53.462
- See what?
- Past, future.

42:54.338 --> 42:57.000
Whatever this object holds.

42:57.174 --> 42:58.300
Is he serious?

42:58.475 --> 43:01.444
Don't worry about fingerprints.
Never had any.

43:03.647 --> 43:06.548
Professor, they were here.

43:09.787 --> 43:13.245
Who was here? Nixon? Houdini?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.324
Jimmy Hoffa? Who?

43:15.492 --> 43:19.155
Show me, Abe.
Show me what happened here.

43:34.612 --> 43:36.739
<i>This is east-wing check-in.
We're all clear.</i>

43:38.916 --> 43:41.942
<i>Also, make sure it's all locked up
over there in the annex.</i>

43:43.220 --> 43:44.244
<i>Roger that.</i>

44:11.148 --> 44:12.809
Kroenen!

44:13.784 --> 44:14.944
Move.

44:30.000 --> 44:31.126
Move!

44:32.636 --> 44:33.796
There he is!

44:42.312 --> 44:44.143
We'll cover him from here!

44:46.183 --> 44:48.583
All right, don't move! Put that down.

44:48.986 --> 44:50.613
Put down the weapon!

44:50.988 --> 44:51.977
Get them.

44:52.156 --> 44:53.748
Drop the weapon.

44:56.126 --> 44:57.753
On the ground!

45:02.232 --> 45:03.790
Last warning!

45:09.773 --> 45:11.434
Take him out!

45:37.034 --> 45:41.471
Now, ready the welcome, my love.

45:46.944 --> 45:52.143
Salt gathered from the tears
of a thousand angels.

45:52.649 --> 45:54.640
Restraining the essence...

45:54.818 --> 45:58.049
...of Sammael, the hellhound.

45:58.989 --> 46:02.356
The seed of destruction.

46:12.336 --> 46:15.931
This I can promise, Sammael.

46:16.940 --> 46:20.034
For each one of you that falls...

46:20.210 --> 46:21.700
...two shall arise.

46:57.080 --> 46:59.412
- Professor.
- I'm all right.

47:01.552 --> 47:02.849
Professor.

47:05.823 --> 47:07.484
You...

47:08.892 --> 47:11.224
You are very sick.

47:12.563 --> 47:15.623
I don't want Hellboy to know.

47:17.768 --> 47:21.226
Sixty years ago,
they tried to destroy the world.

47:21.405 --> 47:22.929
They're back.

47:23.473 --> 47:27.068
In my lifetime, they're back...

47:27.444 --> 47:30.174
...to finish the job.

47:33.250 --> 47:34.911
We miss you at the bureau.

47:35.085 --> 47:37.349
Abe's crazier every day.

47:37.521 --> 47:39.751
Father's still mad at me.

47:43.994 --> 47:45.791
Come back, Liz.

47:45.963 --> 47:48.693
- Come back.
- No. No, H.B.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.097
No, not this time.

47:54.037 --> 47:56.301
I don't like it here...

47:57.140 --> 48:00.701
...but I haven't had an episode
in months.

48:03.180 --> 48:05.478
And you know what?

48:07.417 --> 48:09.783
I'm learning to control it.

48:10.554 --> 48:13.421
I'm learning where it comes from.

48:14.224 --> 48:17.250
For the first time in my life...

48:18.896 --> 48:20.488
...I'm not afraid.

48:28.171 --> 48:31.402
- Looks like your ride is here.
- Have escort stand by.

48:34.945 --> 48:36.537
The Nanny Squad.

48:37.114 --> 48:39.412
Hey, stop. Wait. Wait.

48:40.284 --> 48:43.048
Sir, may I go first?

48:43.220 --> 48:44.915
Hang on a minute.

48:45.088 --> 48:46.555
He barely knows him.

48:46.723 --> 48:50.716
Then he should make it his business
to change that.

48:55.165 --> 48:56.632
Listen, H. B...

48:56.800 --> 48:59.291
...I've got a chance out here.

49:00.037 --> 49:02.232
So if you really care about me...

49:05.676 --> 49:08.304
...you won't come back.

49:19.623 --> 49:21.022
Yeah...

49:21.558 --> 49:22.889
...I gotta go too.

49:25.028 --> 49:26.825
Lots to do.

49:34.738 --> 49:37.036
What took you so long?

49:39.910 --> 49:42.811
Come on, time to go home.

49:43.246 --> 49:45.077
Tape you up.

49:47.985 --> 49:50.044
What are you, a Boy Scout?

49:51.855 --> 49:55.086
- Nope, I never was.
- Well, you could have fooled me.

49:56.693 --> 49:58.058
Hey, Red.

49:58.462 --> 50:01.056
Oh, God. You've lost a lot of blood.

50:01.231 --> 50:02.664
This is nothing.

50:02.833 --> 50:05.427
You know what'll kill me, don't you?

50:06.403 --> 50:08.871
Okay, Red, let's get you home.
Come on.

50:27.391 --> 50:32.488
You were burned
by some organic acid.

50:32.662 --> 50:34.323
I'm lucky that way.

50:35.999 --> 50:38.695
- I worry about you.
- Me?

50:40.804 --> 50:42.533
Well...

50:44.207 --> 50:46.198
...I won't be around forever,
you know.

50:46.376 --> 50:47.468
Damn!

50:47.844 --> 50:50.836
Could you please be a little careful?

50:51.114 --> 50:52.342
Big baby.

50:52.949 --> 50:55.417
How long was it latched onto you?

50:55.786 --> 50:58.254
I don't know. About five seconds.

50:59.389 --> 51:02.881
- Professor, look.
- Is it bad?

51:03.693 --> 51:07.686
Touched you five seconds,
laid three eggs.

51:07.898 --> 51:09.866
Didn't even buy me a drink.

51:14.738 --> 51:18.970
The stinger detaches itself from
the tongue and injects the eggs.

51:19.142 --> 51:23.010
They are very sensitive
to heat and light.

51:24.047 --> 51:29.417
They need a humid,
dark environment to breed.

51:29.586 --> 51:31.577
Did you ever lose track of him?

51:33.290 --> 51:34.780
Well, let's see.

51:34.958 --> 51:38.917
There was that moment when
I had the train on top of my head.

51:39.096 --> 51:40.757
We can't risk it.

51:40.931 --> 51:44.230
Tomorrow you'll go back to the tracks
with a group of agents.

51:44.401 --> 51:47.199
Search the whole place
top to bottom.

51:47.370 --> 51:49.565
Find those eggs and destroy them.

52:00.951 --> 52:02.543
"Elizabeth Sherman. "

52:03.086 --> 52:05.816
<i>I don't like the term "fire-starter. "</i>

52:06.089 --> 52:07.078
<i>I just don't.</i>

52:07.691 --> 52:11.627
<i>And "pyrokinesis" sounds like
some psychosis or something.</i>

52:11.795 --> 52:13.023
<i>I don't know.</i>

52:13.697 --> 52:15.221
<i>Maybe that's right.</i>

52:15.398 --> 52:17.764
<i>Not being able to let go.</i>

52:17.934 --> 52:19.231
<i>It's scary.</i>

52:19.836 --> 52:24.364
<i>I black out after each episode.
Sometimes for hours.</i>

52:25.041 --> 52:27.339
<i>You hear about so and so...</i>

52:27.511 --> 52:30.036
<i>...who just lost control
and just exploded.</i>

52:30.213 --> 52:31.942
<i>Well, they're lucky it isn't true.</i>

52:32.749 --> 52:34.341
<i>With me, it is.</i>

52:46.496 --> 52:51.092
My master is calling
your name now, my girl.

52:51.835 --> 52:54.599
You must return to the child.

52:54.838 --> 52:56.897
So once again...

52:57.374 --> 52:59.535
...dream...

53:00.010 --> 53:02.103
...of fire.

53:18.862 --> 53:20.090
Hey, freak!

53:21.565 --> 53:23.157
Get back here, freak!

53:23.333 --> 53:24.857
- Let's get her!
- Get her!

53:25.535 --> 53:27.332
- Get her, guys!
- Watch this!

53:28.872 --> 53:29.998
Freak!

53:33.677 --> 53:36.202
Oh, no! Not again.

53:36.713 --> 53:39.045
Oh, no! Somebody!

53:39.216 --> 53:40.615
Help me!

53:40.817 --> 53:43.911
Help me, somebody! Help me!

54:30.333 --> 54:33.234
How many buildings
does she have to burn down?

54:33.403 --> 54:35.234
She belongs here.

54:35.538 --> 54:36.869
That's not what she feels.

54:37.440 --> 54:40.443
She may never feel it.
It's her choice.

54:40.478 --> 54:41.945
Professor, the girl you're...

54:42.946 --> 54:46.950
Professor,
that girl you're talking about...

54:46.985 --> 54:48.302
Hey, Boy Scout...

54:48.337 --> 54:49.619
...think twice.

54:49.719 --> 54:51.710
No, listen, I read her file.

54:52.722 --> 54:54.713
- "Read her file. "
- She blames herself...

54:54.891 --> 54:58.657
...for that explosion in Pittsburgh.
Look, I think I can help.

54:59.929 --> 55:01.260
I could talk to her.

55:01.431 --> 55:03.262
I think I could bring her back.

55:03.700 --> 55:07.033
Just what was it that landed you
this job pushing "pamcakes," huh?

55:07.404 --> 55:08.894
What was it?

55:09.072 --> 55:12.098
Punctuality?
The way you part your hair?

55:12.275 --> 55:14.266
What is your area of expertise?

55:17.113 --> 55:18.546
<i>He doesn't want me with him.</i>

55:18.882 --> 55:20.042
I know that much.

55:20.250 --> 55:22.480
- You're doing fine.
- No, I'm not.

55:22.652 --> 55:24.882
Look, he respects Clay, not me.

55:26.690 --> 55:28.419
I'm really sorry, okay?

55:30.560 --> 55:31.959
I'm not your guy.

55:32.896 --> 55:35.797
I'm dying, Agent Myers.

55:37.167 --> 55:40.068
Like any father, I worry about him.

55:42.505 --> 55:46.236
In medieval stories,
there is often a young knight...

55:46.409 --> 55:49.970
...who is inexperienced...

55:51.081 --> 55:53.675
...but pure of heart.
- Come on.

55:53.850 --> 55:56.045
Look, I am not pure of heart.

55:56.219 --> 55:57.777
Yes, you are.

55:58.688 --> 56:01.350
Rasputin is back for him.

56:01.591 --> 56:03.354
What I ask of you...

56:03.526 --> 56:07.587
...is to have the courage
to stand by him when I am gone.

56:08.465 --> 56:11.059
He was born a demon.
Can't change that.

56:11.234 --> 56:13.259
But you will help him...

56:14.037 --> 56:15.868
...in essence...

56:16.539 --> 56:18.097
...to become a man.

56:33.590 --> 56:34.579
Pull that down.

56:34.758 --> 56:36.658
<i>She was making great progress...</i>

56:36.826 --> 56:37.986
...and now this.

56:38.161 --> 56:40.152
We'll be closed for months.

56:40.330 --> 56:42.662
And it put a big dent
in our Thorazine supply.

56:43.666 --> 56:46.226
She's been like this
since it happened.

56:48.138 --> 56:51.767
Are you sure you want to go in?

56:59.549 --> 57:01.483
Miss Sherman?

57:01.651 --> 57:04.279
I'm Agent Myers, FBI.

57:07.757 --> 57:09.588
Miss Sherman?

57:11.528 --> 57:14.190
Can I call you Liz?

57:14.364 --> 57:16.798
It's a beautiful name.

57:16.966 --> 57:20.595
Sixty percent of all the women
in the world are named Liz.

57:21.471 --> 57:25.430
Well, it's impressive by my standards.
My name's John.

57:25.809 --> 57:28.277
John T. Myers.

57:28.912 --> 57:31.380
Dr. Broom asked me to invite you
back to the bureau.

57:31.548 --> 57:35.177
No special precautions,
no security escorts.

57:35.351 --> 57:38.809
Just you and me in a taxi
like regular folks.

57:39.823 --> 57:41.620
That doesn't sound like him.

57:41.791 --> 57:45.158
Well, Miss Sherman,
he's asking you back...

57:45.328 --> 57:47.523
...but it's entirely your choice,
you know?

57:47.864 --> 57:49.388
Choice, huh?

57:49.566 --> 57:51.363
That's cute.

57:51.534 --> 57:54.867
I've quit the bureau 13 times.

57:55.038 --> 57:57.268
I always go back.

57:57.440 --> 57:59.635
Where else would I go?

58:17.427 --> 58:18.917
Over here.

58:20.396 --> 58:22.887
You said those eggs need it
dark and humid?

58:23.066 --> 58:25.000
Well, they hit the jackpot.

58:25.168 --> 58:28.501
The subway lines,
they all converge right around here.

58:28.705 --> 58:31.105
Right below us
is the old Vandeveer reservoir.

58:31.274 --> 58:33.071
It was abandoned in the mid-30s.

58:33.276 --> 58:34.834
There's a pulse.

58:37.180 --> 58:40.911
There. A cistern on the other side.

58:44.454 --> 58:46.547
Most of the eggs are there.

58:47.690 --> 58:49.021
There's no way in.

58:50.527 --> 58:53.496
We should go back and request
a special permit, type 2...

59:11.614 --> 59:13.445
You guys coming or what?

59:34.571 --> 59:36.664
We lead a charmed life.

59:52.322 --> 59:54.051
Here you are, doctor.

59:54.757 --> 59:56.259
This should cover your tail fin.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.761
Reliquary. Straight from the Vatican.

01:00:01.264 --> 01:00:04.767
A bone from St. Dionysius.
Looks like a pinkie.

01:00:05.768 --> 01:00:07.670
Remind me why I keep doing this.

01:00:07.704 --> 01:00:10.332
Rotten eggs
and the safety of mankind.

01:00:54.951 --> 01:00:57.613
This doesn't really look
like doll's hair.

01:00:57.787 --> 01:00:59.516
Be honest, Red. What do you think?

01:01:00.757 --> 01:01:02.588
I'm thinking about doing it myself.

01:01:03.893 --> 01:01:05.485
Hey, you guys find anything?

01:01:05.662 --> 01:01:06.651
<i>No eggs yet, Red.</i>

01:01:06.829 --> 01:01:08.626
<i>What, are you on a lunch break?</i>

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:10.163
Nothing here.

01:01:20.009 --> 01:01:21.806
Red's on the move. I'll cover him.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.585
Damn it, Red.

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:16.680
Hey, it's Abe.

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:24.390
Oh, God.

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:27.792
Bring your toy over here.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:30.663
Oh, man.

01:03:31.407 --> 01:03:32.806
Oh, Jesus.

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.538
There's only one. I'll fry him quick.

01:03:36.712 --> 01:03:38.805
Two. There were two.

01:04:06.976 --> 01:04:08.068
Red?

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.041
Red. Come in, Red.

01:04:10.213 --> 01:04:13.410
What's your 20? I got no signal.
Where the hell are you?

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:15.915
<i>It's like Swiss cheese in here.</i>

01:04:16.586 --> 01:04:18.486
Sit tight, pal, I'm on him.

01:04:35.508 --> 01:04:38.341
Sammael, hound of the resurrection.

01:04:42.081 --> 01:04:43.981
Didn't I kill you already?

01:04:54.560 --> 01:04:57.188
You goddamn monster!

01:05:19.485 --> 01:05:20.509
Oh, crap.

01:05:35.969 --> 01:05:37.266
It's for you!

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:40.235
You shouldn't hurt people!

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.354
You missed.

01:06:22.115 --> 01:06:24.379
Hey, chunk-face.

01:06:26.052 --> 01:06:29.544
You can do better than that,
big monster like you.

01:07:20.473 --> 01:07:23.041
My kittens! Please!

01:07:23.076 --> 01:07:26.079
Somebody, please, get my kittens!

01:07:30.850 --> 01:07:32.283
Second date.

01:07:33.186 --> 01:07:34.653
No tongue.

01:07:47.333 --> 01:07:49.767
My kittens. Careful with them!

01:07:49.936 --> 01:07:51.927
Lady, give me a break!

01:08:12.458 --> 01:08:13.447
Thank you.

01:08:15.128 --> 01:08:16.152
My job.

01:09:08.680 --> 01:09:13.185
<i>Clay, I'm getting a signal from Abe.
I'm on my way back.</i>

01:09:16.189 --> 01:09:18.691
Buddy, don't take another step.

01:09:44.015 --> 01:09:45.745
Clay.

01:10:19.885 --> 01:10:22.911
Man down. I need an ambulance
right away. Do you read me?

01:10:23.122 --> 01:10:24.749
Hang in there, pal.

01:10:25.157 --> 01:10:28.558
Man down.
Do you read? Do you read?

01:10:31.030 --> 01:10:33.294
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?

01:10:33.866 --> 01:10:36.858
Quarry, Moss, do you read me?
Man down!

01:10:42.742 --> 01:10:46.769
Feels good to be outside.
It's been so long.

01:10:46.946 --> 01:10:49.506
You know that's...
That's not safe Miss Sherman.

01:10:49.682 --> 01:10:51.513
Please stay in the car.

01:10:55.788 --> 01:10:59.884
No, no. Miss Sherman. Please,
can you come down, Miss Sherman?

01:11:08.467 --> 01:11:10.059
Nice view.

01:11:11.003 --> 01:11:14.905
Hey, a smile, huh?
Yeah, that's good.

01:11:15.474 --> 01:11:17.135
Here.

01:11:18.644 --> 01:11:20.407
Damn.

01:11:21.247 --> 01:11:25.411
- You'll have to take another one later.
- Yeah.

01:11:49.141 --> 01:11:51.166
He'll make it.

01:11:53.212 --> 01:11:55.373
Not everyone was so lucky.

01:11:56.949 --> 01:11:59.315
We had two agents die today.

01:11:59.985 --> 01:12:02.419
Clay probably won't survive
the night.

01:12:02.588 --> 01:12:05.318
- Not now, Manning, please.
- My problem with you:

01:12:07.026 --> 01:12:08.493
You're reckless.

01:12:08.661 --> 01:12:11.994
These men trusted you
to lead them as a team.

01:12:12.164 --> 01:12:14.029
Where were you?

01:12:14.900 --> 01:12:16.765
I knew those men
better than you did.

01:12:16.936 --> 01:12:20.633
- That makes it all right, then.
- No, it doesn't make it all right.

01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:24.377
- But I stopped that thing, didn't I?
- Yes, you did.

01:12:24.412 --> 01:12:26.897
It's what you do.
It's why we need you.

01:12:26.932 --> 01:12:29.382
You have an insight.
You know monsters.

01:12:30.883 --> 01:12:32.885
What are you trying to say?

01:12:33.886 --> 01:12:36.389
This whole thing is a farce.

01:12:36.889 --> 01:12:37.890
Because in the end...

01:12:38.391 --> 01:12:41.726
...after you've killed, after you've
captured every freak out there...

01:12:42.661 --> 01:12:44.458
...there's still one left.

01:12:45.331 --> 01:12:46.821
You.

01:12:51.270 --> 01:12:52.999
Hey, Manning.

01:12:53.172 --> 01:12:55.766
I wish I could be more gracious, but...

01:13:02.148 --> 01:13:04.548
Welcome back.

01:13:06.185 --> 01:13:08.813
It's only for the weekend,
Professor Broom.

01:13:09.722 --> 01:13:12.190
Then I shall be on my way.

01:13:12.358 --> 01:13:15.327
Oh, you should have a look around.

01:13:15.494 --> 01:13:17.860
We made some changes
around here.

01:13:25.204 --> 01:13:28.970
I want that thing locked up,
starting now.

01:13:29.141 --> 01:13:30.904
Right now! Do you...?

01:13:31.277 --> 01:13:33.177
Now, you hear me?

01:13:33.345 --> 01:13:35.279
- Locked up!
- Nothing's changed.

01:13:35.481 --> 01:13:36.607
Home sweet home.

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:38.144
Liz?

01:13:40.719 --> 01:13:42.380
Liz!

01:13:44.423 --> 01:13:47.119
You did it, buddy. You did it!

01:13:50.696 --> 01:13:52.493
Myers?

01:13:53.032 --> 01:13:54.727
Pop?

01:14:02.641 --> 01:14:05.075
Hey, how you doing?

01:14:05.244 --> 01:14:07.235
Hey, what's that on your wrist?

01:14:08.347 --> 01:14:09.939
This?

01:14:10.115 --> 01:14:14.347
- It's something I learned in therapy.
- Yeah?

01:14:14.520 --> 01:14:17.512
I'm depressed, one rubber band.

01:14:17.690 --> 01:14:19.487
I'm impatient...

01:14:21.727 --> 01:14:23.558
...two rubber bands.

01:14:23.729 --> 01:14:25.594
Maybe...

01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:30.166
Maybe I should get you
a fresh pack.

01:14:32.471 --> 01:14:34.200
Yeah, maybe two.

01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.708
Yeah, maybe.

01:14:44.817 --> 01:14:47.183
I'm gonna put these over here, okay?

01:14:47.353 --> 01:14:48.615
One minute. One minute.

01:14:52.091 --> 01:14:53.649
Hey, Myers...

01:14:53.826 --> 01:14:55.953
...you're a talker.

01:14:56.195 --> 01:14:59.426
What's a good word,
a solid word, for "need"?

01:14:59.598 --> 01:15:00.758
Well...

01:15:00.933 --> 01:15:02.924
..."need" is a good, solid word.

01:15:03.102 --> 01:15:04.330
Too needy.

01:15:04.503 --> 01:15:06.971
Start in, okay?
You got nachos coming.

01:15:08.807 --> 01:15:09.933
Nachos.

01:15:10.109 --> 01:15:11.701
Oh, my God.

01:15:11.877 --> 01:15:13.708
Look at them all.

01:15:14.446 --> 01:15:16.573
Who had babies?

01:15:18.217 --> 01:15:23.177
Liz, there's something I need
for you to hear, and it's...

01:15:23.355 --> 01:15:25.846
Will it take long?
Because I'm actually going out.

01:15:27.626 --> 01:15:28.615
Out?

01:15:30.162 --> 01:15:31.151
"Out" out?

01:15:31.697 --> 01:15:35.690
Yeah. Yeah, for a cup of coffee,
but go ahead, read.

01:15:35.868 --> 01:15:37.358
Are you going alone?

01:15:38.871 --> 01:15:41.203
No, Myers is taking me.

01:15:42.207 --> 01:15:44.607
Hey, your chili's getting cold.

01:15:45.210 --> 01:15:46.234
Not hungry.

01:15:48.314 --> 01:15:50.373
Is there something
you'd like me to hear?

01:15:50.549 --> 01:15:53.245
- It's just a list. It's not finished.
- Okay.

01:15:53.419 --> 01:15:55.353
Well, then, later.

01:15:56.121 --> 01:15:57.850
See you.

01:15:59.158 --> 01:16:01.251
- Anything else you need?
- Not from you.

01:16:02.428 --> 01:16:03.417
Well, good night.

01:16:04.630 --> 01:16:05.790
Goodbye.

01:16:15.608 --> 01:16:18.771
Subject: Karl Ruprecht Kroenen.

01:16:19.111 --> 01:16:22.012
Born in Munich, 1897.

01:16:23.082 --> 01:16:25.983
Suffered from
a masochistic compulsion...

01:16:26.852 --> 01:16:30.185
...commonly known
as surgical addiction.

01:16:33.592 --> 01:16:36.993
Both eyelids surgically removed...

01:16:40.265 --> 01:16:42.130
...along with his upper...

01:16:43.535 --> 01:16:45.127
...and lower lip.

01:16:46.939 --> 01:16:50.932
The blood in his veins
dried up decades ago.

01:16:52.711 --> 01:16:55.908
Only dust remains.

01:16:59.284 --> 01:17:02.310
What horrible will...

01:17:03.155 --> 01:17:06.215
...could keep such a creature
as this alive?

01:17:40.259 --> 01:17:42.250
Oh, no.

01:17:44.063 --> 01:17:46.054
Come on, Red.

01:17:48.133 --> 01:17:49.828
Jesus.

01:17:55.974 --> 01:17:59.239
Damn it, Red. Not again

01:18:00.913 --> 01:18:03.473
And one of those cookies.
Do you have any doughnuts?

01:18:03.649 --> 01:18:05.981
Sorry, pal. How about a bear claw?

01:18:23.736 --> 01:18:26.830
Do you want anything else?
The shop's closing.

01:18:27.005 --> 01:18:28.836
Here we go.

01:18:29.041 --> 01:18:30.770
Listen about...

01:18:31.143 --> 01:18:33.737
I admire him. He's a force of nature.

01:18:33.912 --> 01:18:36.506
What are you two talking about?

01:18:36.682 --> 01:18:39.981
What is so fascinating,
so important?

01:18:40.152 --> 01:18:42.518
No. He's determined, unstoppable.

01:18:42.688 --> 01:18:44.679
Some people would call that cocky.

01:18:44.857 --> 01:18:47.348
- He's just strong.
- Yeah. That he is.

01:18:47.526 --> 01:18:48.993
Hey, I've got yours.

01:18:49.762 --> 01:18:54.358
My uncle, he used to say
we like people for their qualities...

01:18:54.533 --> 01:18:56.728
...but love them for their defects.

01:18:58.771 --> 01:19:00.534
He loves you, you know.

01:19:02.808 --> 01:19:04.207
What about you?

01:19:05.878 --> 01:19:08.608
I don't know. I grew up with him.

01:19:10.449 --> 01:19:13.418
But now every time I see him,
I get confused.

01:19:13.585 --> 01:19:16.554
There's hardly a day that goes by
that he's not in my mind.

01:19:16.722 --> 01:19:17.882
Even now...

01:19:19.024 --> 01:19:21.117
...I feel like he's here.

01:19:22.561 --> 01:19:24.119
Hey, wait up.

01:19:27.199 --> 01:19:29.599
You like doughnuts? I got two.

01:19:30.435 --> 01:19:33.233
- Thanks. That was nice.
- I got a cookie, as well.

01:19:33.405 --> 01:19:35.635
- Sugar?
- No. No sugar. Thank you.

01:19:35.808 --> 01:19:38.299
No cream and sugar, moron.
She takes it black.

01:19:38.744 --> 01:19:41.645
- I got some milk here.
- No. I'm okay. I don't take milk.

01:19:42.447 --> 01:19:43.675
Told you.

01:19:47.519 --> 01:19:49.009
She took his picture.

01:19:49.488 --> 01:19:50.648
Damn!

01:19:52.825 --> 01:19:54.656
She took his picture.

01:19:57.029 --> 01:19:58.690
She took his picture.

01:20:01.567 --> 01:20:03.057
She took his picture.

01:20:06.371 --> 01:20:07.668
Oh, crap.

01:20:17.216 --> 01:20:18.740
It's freezing, isn't it?

01:20:19.384 --> 01:20:21.215
Coffee's warming me up.

01:20:22.521 --> 01:20:24.284
Well, what do we do now?

01:20:24.456 --> 01:20:27.857
Newark, New Jersey,
entertainment capital of the world.

01:20:28.560 --> 01:20:31.358
- You sound like a game-show host.
- Hi.

01:20:31.730 --> 01:20:33.197
Hey.

01:20:35.601 --> 01:20:36.659
You're Hellboy.

01:20:40.405 --> 01:20:42.373
I'm on a mission.

01:20:45.277 --> 01:20:48.610
All right, tell me something about you.
Where do you come from?

01:20:48.780 --> 01:20:51.146
I lived with my uncle most of my life.

01:20:51.316 --> 01:20:54.911
Then I went to Quantico, went to top
of my class. I'm nothing like...

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:56.514
Don't tell anyone, huh?

01:21:00.292 --> 01:21:01.384
Attaboy.

01:21:09.801 --> 01:21:11.996
Sir, he left his locator.

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:16.368
- Shall we send out some scouts?
- Enough, enough, enough.

01:21:18.143 --> 01:21:20.577
He'll never change.

01:21:20.879 --> 01:21:22.471
A child.

01:21:23.582 --> 01:21:26.016
Always a child.

01:21:40.632 --> 01:21:45.035
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

01:21:45.203 --> 01:21:46.932
Moscow.

01:21:47.105 --> 01:21:49.903
Who wants us in Moscow?

01:22:37.155 --> 01:22:39.817
- My mom baked them.
- She's laughing.

01:22:40.726 --> 01:22:43.422
She's sitting on a park bench,
and she's laughing.

01:22:43.996 --> 01:22:46.521
That's it. I'm done.

01:22:46.932 --> 01:22:48.832
They don't look like spies.

01:22:49.701 --> 01:22:51.669
Are you kidding me?

01:22:52.004 --> 01:22:53.665
Look at this guy.

01:22:53.839 --> 01:22:57.536
Those shady little eyes,
that phony grin.

01:22:58.076 --> 01:23:00.510
- Are you going to eat that?
- No.

01:23:02.180 --> 01:23:05.308
Hey, he's yawning. He's bored.

01:23:05.484 --> 01:23:08.078
Yeah, the old yawning trick.

01:23:10.155 --> 01:23:11.747
Watch his arm.

01:23:18.463 --> 01:23:21.955
First he wants my job,
then he wants my girl.

01:23:25.637 --> 01:23:28.902
Hey, we all have a side
that we try to hide.

01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:36.972
God...

01:23:37.249 --> 01:23:38.841
Hey, what the hell?

01:23:39.017 --> 01:23:42.214
Hey! Hey, who threw that?

01:23:45.157 --> 01:23:48.183
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:23:51.263 --> 01:23:52.787
Nice shot.

01:23:57.536 --> 01:24:01.563
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

01:24:02.274 --> 01:24:04.936
It's Rasputin's mausoleum.

01:24:12.217 --> 01:24:13.946
I see the puppet.

01:24:14.719 --> 01:24:16.983
But where is...

01:24:17.956 --> 01:24:19.480
...the puppeteer?

01:24:19.658 --> 01:24:21.592
Very good, Professor Broom.

01:24:23.428 --> 01:24:24.895
It was you.

01:24:25.063 --> 01:24:27.531
The scraps of paper...

01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:30.497
...Liz's sudden relapse and return.

01:24:30.669 --> 01:24:32.569
Bread crumbs on the trail.

01:24:32.737 --> 01:24:34.568
Like in a fable.

01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:36.965
They both distract him...

01:24:37.742 --> 01:24:39.869
...and guide him exactly
where I need him.

01:24:40.045 --> 01:24:41.205
Moscow.

01:24:41.379 --> 01:24:43.370
His destiny.

01:24:44.816 --> 01:24:46.113
And the last clue...

01:24:46.284 --> 01:24:49.412
...will be left by
the late Professor Broom.

01:24:49.588 --> 01:24:51.283
You raised the child.

01:24:51.456 --> 01:24:53.321
Nurtured him.

01:24:53.492 --> 01:24:55.585
So in return...

01:24:56.027 --> 01:24:57.619
...I will permit you...

01:24:57.796 --> 01:25:02.460
...a brief, brief glimpse of the future.

01:25:30.962 --> 01:25:33.123
<i>He will open the portal...</i>

01:25:33.298 --> 01:25:36.165
<i>...and bring about
the end of the world.</i>

01:25:40.472 --> 01:25:43.964
<i>If only you had had him destroyed
60 years ago...</i>

01:25:44.142 --> 01:25:46.303
<i>...none of this would have
come to pass.</i>

01:25:46.478 --> 01:25:49.845
<i>But then,
how could you have known?</i>

01:25:50.015 --> 01:25:53.075
<i>Your God chooses to remain silent.</i>

01:25:53.818 --> 01:25:56.116
Mine lives within me.

01:25:56.288 --> 01:25:58.882
Every time I died and crossed over...

01:25:59.824 --> 01:26:04.124
...a little more of the master...

01:26:04.296 --> 01:26:06.594
...came back with me.

01:26:07.265 --> 01:26:10.666
He disclosed to me
the child's true name.

01:26:11.503 --> 01:26:13.334
Would you like to know it?

01:26:13.505 --> 01:26:17.202
I know what to call him.

01:26:19.144 --> 01:26:22.910
Nothing you can do or say...

01:26:23.081 --> 01:26:25.311
...can change that.

01:26:26.218 --> 01:26:28.186
I call him...

01:26:30.488 --> 01:26:31.750
...Son.

01:26:37.329 --> 01:26:39.126
I'm ready.

01:26:41.266 --> 01:26:42.563
It'll be quick.

01:27:06.958 --> 01:27:10.291
Just go there
and tell her how you feel.

01:27:12.530 --> 01:27:13.690
My mom says that...

01:27:13.865 --> 01:27:16.800
Look, it's not...
It's not that easy, okay?

01:27:19.537 --> 01:27:21.664
Plus, you're 9.

01:27:22.173 --> 01:27:24.767
You're not old enough
to be giving me advice.

01:27:26.745 --> 01:27:29.407
- All right, stand by.
- Who are those guys?

01:27:37.289 --> 01:27:40.986
Liz, I'm sorry. It's Broom.
Let's go. We need to find him.

01:27:41.159 --> 01:27:43.024
- No!
- Wait, what happened?

01:27:43.194 --> 01:27:44.525
- No!
- It's okay.

01:27:44.696 --> 01:27:46.061
No, not him.

01:27:46.231 --> 01:27:48.222
- Would you take her?
- Something's wrong.

01:29:37.108 --> 01:29:40.009
<i>He hasn't spoken to anybody
in three days.</i>

01:29:40.678 --> 01:29:42.339
Not a word.

01:29:42.647 --> 01:29:45.138
He won't eat, he won't sleep.

01:29:45.750 --> 01:29:47.809
I've never seen him like this.

01:29:47.986 --> 01:29:48.975
Never.

01:29:49.654 --> 01:29:51.554
Should I stay?

01:29:52.157 --> 01:29:54.284
With him, I mean?

01:29:56.094 --> 01:30:00.326
Listen, I'm not much
of a problem solver.

01:30:01.566 --> 01:30:06.128
Three decades,
I've only completed two sides.

01:30:06.304 --> 01:30:07.737
But I do know this much.

01:30:07.906 --> 01:30:10.136
If there's trouble...

01:30:10.308 --> 01:30:14.244
...all us freaks have is each other.

01:30:15.513 --> 01:30:17.071
And I'm stuck here.

01:30:17.248 --> 01:30:18.875
So...

01:30:19.050 --> 01:30:22.451
...take care of the big monkey for me,
will you?

01:31:04.896 --> 01:31:08.889
I have accumulated many objects
of great interest...

01:31:09.067 --> 01:31:12.002
...preserving our heritage.

01:31:14.372 --> 01:31:17.466
Many, like me,
believe Mother Russia...

01:31:17.642 --> 01:31:22.102
...to be very close
to a historic rebirth.

01:31:23.248 --> 01:31:24.875
"Rebirth"?

01:31:25.950 --> 01:31:27.975
I like that.

01:31:34.292 --> 01:31:37.022
Twenty tons of stone.

01:31:37.195 --> 01:31:40.130
This thing fell from the sky
into Tunguska Forest.

01:31:40.298 --> 01:31:42.289
June 30th, 1908.

01:31:42.467 --> 01:31:45.630
The Romanovs took possession
of it immediately.

01:31:45.803 --> 01:31:47.896
I've wanted it for ages.

01:31:48.072 --> 01:31:49.437
You're aware, of course...

01:31:49.607 --> 01:31:53.338
...there's no way you'll get it out
of Russian territory.

01:31:53.511 --> 01:31:57.948
He is aware.
Our guests are coming in.

01:31:58.283 --> 01:32:02.310
Volokolamsk Fields, 50 miles from
Moscow, that's where we're going.

01:32:02.487 --> 01:32:06.856
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.
That's the only clue we have.

01:32:07.025 --> 01:32:09.721
We've collected
and destroyed thousands of eggs...

01:32:09.894 --> 01:32:13.853
...but we have no trace of this
Sammael or this Rasputin character.

01:32:14.032 --> 01:32:17.559
We leave as soon
as we get clearance and equipment.

01:32:17.735 --> 01:32:19.396
Hellboy's coming.

01:32:19.904 --> 01:32:22.930
I'm not pleased about that,
but I'll be in charge this time.

01:32:23.107 --> 01:32:27.601
We either wrap this up or I'm closing
this freak show for good.

01:32:37.822 --> 01:32:39.119
Hi.

01:32:39.457 --> 01:32:40.515
Hi.

01:32:45.363 --> 01:32:47.024
I'll...

01:32:47.332 --> 01:32:49.129
...come to Moscow...

01:32:49.300 --> 01:32:51.632
...if you're still going.

01:32:52.103 --> 01:32:53.263
I am.

01:32:53.771 --> 01:32:56.171
But I have something to say.

01:32:58.643 --> 01:33:01.043
I understand
what you don't like about me.

01:33:01.212 --> 01:33:02.474
I do.

01:33:03.815 --> 01:33:05.305
What I am...

01:33:06.884 --> 01:33:09.444
...makes you feel
a little out of place...

01:33:09.921 --> 01:33:10.910
...out there.

01:33:11.089 --> 01:33:12.579
- Red, I don't...
- Listen.

01:33:15.193 --> 01:33:16.626
I'm not like Myers.

01:33:17.862 --> 01:33:20.262
He makes you feel like you belong...

01:33:20.999 --> 01:33:22.626
...which is good, really.

01:33:29.507 --> 01:33:32.101
I wish I could do something about this.

01:33:34.112 --> 01:33:35.977
I can't.

01:33:38.116 --> 01:33:40.482
I can promise you two things:

01:33:41.619 --> 01:33:44.110
One, I'll always look this good.

01:33:48.993 --> 01:33:51.120
And two...

01:33:52.630 --> 01:33:54.530
...I'll never give up on you.

01:33:57.335 --> 01:33:58.461
Ever.

01:34:00.605 --> 01:34:02.163
I like that.

01:34:16.721 --> 01:34:20.316
This engraving here
represents Sammy. Text reads:

01:34:20.491 --> 01:34:25.019
"One falls, two shall arise. Sammael. "

01:34:26.898 --> 01:34:29.526
We'll have to nail them all at once,
and the eggs.

01:34:29.701 --> 01:34:31.726
And when we do, no mumbo jumbo.

01:34:33.104 --> 01:34:35.937
Double-core Vulcan-65 grenades.

01:34:36.107 --> 01:34:39.474
We've installed a handy little timer.
You set it, you walk away.

01:34:39.644 --> 01:34:41.544
Cable pulls the safety pins.

01:34:41.879 --> 01:34:42.868
Kaboom.

01:34:43.047 --> 01:34:45.140
Easy to clean, easy to use.

01:34:51.923 --> 01:34:55.154
Sparky to Big Red.
Do you read me? Come in.

01:34:57.995 --> 01:34:59.292
"Sparky"?

01:34:59.464 --> 01:35:01.762
<i>Who came up with that? Myers?</i>

01:35:02.066 --> 01:35:05.092
<i>Yeah, we're leaving the main road,
so hang on.</i>

01:35:05.269 --> 01:35:07.294
This better be the place or I'll puke.

01:35:14.579 --> 01:35:16.171
You better come out and see.

01:35:28.826 --> 01:35:32.262
Sebastian Plackba, number 16.

01:35:41.973 --> 01:35:46.137
Forget it. We're never gonna find
Rasputin's mausoleum.

01:35:46.310 --> 01:35:48.744
It's practically a city.

01:35:48.913 --> 01:35:51.211
And it stinks, and it's muddy.

01:35:51.382 --> 01:35:56.376
I think we go back, we check
into the hotel, we regroup.

01:35:56.554 --> 01:35:58.385
After breakfast.

01:35:58.556 --> 01:36:02.014
I think what we have to do here
is we have to make a grid.

01:36:02.193 --> 01:36:07.290
We go in by quadrants.
Maybe satellite photography.

01:36:10.635 --> 01:36:12.694
Let me ask for directions.

01:36:14.906 --> 01:36:16.897
Where are you going?

01:36:27.285 --> 01:36:30.686
Come on, baby, find me a talker.

01:36:49.307 --> 01:36:50.467
Hi there.

01:37:11.095 --> 01:37:12.357
Come on.

01:37:13.497 --> 01:37:14.589
Come on.

01:37:15.499 --> 01:37:16.727
Come on.

01:37:20.338 --> 01:37:22.033
What do you want?

01:37:22.940 --> 01:37:24.737
This is ridiculous.

01:37:26.878 --> 01:37:28.402
I run this show, not him.

01:37:28.579 --> 01:37:30.308
This guy's nothing but trouble.

01:37:32.617 --> 01:37:35.085
- Ten minutes, we're out of here.
- Will you shut up...

01:37:35.253 --> 01:37:37.221
...and let him do his thing?

01:37:37.388 --> 01:37:39.288
Anybody got a PowerBar?

01:37:42.159 --> 01:37:44.559
Hey, there he is.

01:37:46.530 --> 01:37:48.930
Sixty feet further, comrades.

01:37:49.867 --> 01:37:51.459
And three rows in.

01:37:52.203 --> 01:37:54.364
What the hell is that on his back?

01:37:55.106 --> 01:37:57.836
This here is Ivan Klimentovich.

01:37:58.042 --> 01:37:59.703
Say "hi," Ivan.

01:37:59.977 --> 01:38:02.411
Go that way, Red Monkey!

01:38:02.613 --> 01:38:03.602
Gotcha.

01:38:16.060 --> 01:38:18.893
Ivan says there's a whole network
of tunnels down here.

01:38:19.063 --> 01:38:20.394
Goes on for miles.

01:38:25.469 --> 01:38:27.994
Stay close, everybody.

01:38:28.572 --> 01:38:30.233
You better be right about this.

01:38:38.983 --> 01:38:41.474
We'll be all right as long as
we don't separate.

01:38:59.537 --> 01:39:01.528
Hey, Sparky.

01:39:01.706 --> 01:39:05.335
Tell everyone to turn their locator
belts on. Anybody sees anything...

01:39:05.509 --> 01:39:06.703
I'll say "Marco. "

01:39:06.877 --> 01:39:07.901
Polo.

01:39:08.346 --> 01:39:11.679
<i>- Are you sure about this?
- On a scale of one to ten: two.</i>

01:39:12.249 --> 01:39:15.412
Don't worry, Boy Scout,
she'll take care of you.

01:39:15.586 --> 01:39:17.247
<i>She's a tough one.</i>

01:39:20.925 --> 01:39:21.983
Come on.

01:39:32.870 --> 01:39:35.600
Ask your buddy
how far this thing goes.

01:39:51.522 --> 01:39:53.422
How you doing up there, Ivan?

01:39:53.824 --> 01:39:57.191
If I had legs I'd kick your ass!

01:39:57.928 --> 01:40:00.954
Would you mind holding this guy
for a while? He is so negative.

01:40:16.247 --> 01:40:17.578
What the hell is that?

01:40:26.057 --> 01:40:27.581
Something big.

01:40:27.758 --> 01:40:29.487
- Lime, come with me.
- Right.

01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:32.925
No, no, no. Stay put!

01:40:35.466 --> 01:40:37.127
Stop!

01:40:37.802 --> 01:40:39.599
You listen to me.

01:40:39.770 --> 01:40:40.828
Listen to me!

01:40:41.906 --> 01:40:42.930
I'm in charge.

01:40:43.107 --> 01:40:46.008
We're gonna go back.
You can take that door apart.

01:40:46.177 --> 01:40:49.806
Whatever it is, it's coming for us.
Now, we gotta move forward!

01:40:49.980 --> 01:40:51.311
Lime, let's go!

01:40:51.482 --> 01:40:54.144
Stay put!

01:40:55.419 --> 01:40:59.788
And you! I am not afraid of you!

01:40:59.957 --> 01:41:02.721
I'm in charge! We go back!

01:41:05.930 --> 01:41:10.697
I was better off dead!

01:41:35.192 --> 01:41:36.352
Oh, crap.

01:42:10.561 --> 01:42:12.392
Music.

01:42:55.239 --> 01:42:56.263
Really went deep.

01:43:02.780 --> 01:43:04.509
Hey, what's wrong with you?!

01:43:28.138 --> 01:43:30.003
You killed my father.

01:43:30.174 --> 01:43:31.402
Your ass is mine.

01:43:43.520 --> 01:43:45.988
What are you laughing at,
you Nazi son of a...?

01:44:11.915 --> 01:44:13.746
Don't even think about it.

01:44:34.872 --> 01:44:37.670
That's all for you, pinhead.

01:44:47.051 --> 01:44:48.678
What are you doing?

01:44:48.852 --> 01:44:50.410
- What are you doing?
- Having a...

01:44:50.587 --> 01:44:52.316
You never light a cigar that way.

01:44:52.489 --> 01:44:53.956
You use a wooden match.

01:44:56.327 --> 01:44:58.625
Preserves the flavor. You see?

01:45:07.838 --> 01:45:09.396
Thank you.

01:45:09.573 --> 01:45:11.131
Thank you.

01:45:17.681 --> 01:45:20.707
So he thinks you and I...

01:45:22.152 --> 01:45:23.915
That's why he's mad at me.

01:45:29.126 --> 01:45:32.254
But it's not true, right?

01:45:34.064 --> 01:45:35.088
What?

01:45:35.265 --> 01:45:38.496
Well, that, you know,
you feel that way about me.

01:45:38.869 --> 01:45:42.100
You want to know that here? Now?

01:45:46.810 --> 01:45:47.902
Yeah.

01:45:50.013 --> 01:45:53.107
Red, white, whatever.
Guys are all the same.

01:45:56.086 --> 01:45:57.110
Hey, wait up.

01:45:58.288 --> 01:46:00.051
<i>Have you found them yet?</i>

01:46:00.224 --> 01:46:03.193
<i>I got them right below me.
It's a matter of minutes.</i>

01:46:03.360 --> 01:46:04.987
Okay, good.

01:46:06.697 --> 01:46:11.225
Could you hurry up?
Because it's a little spooky in here.

01:46:12.002 --> 01:46:14.071
Liz, wait.

01:46:17.074 --> 01:46:19.076
Oh, my God.

01:46:20.077 --> 01:46:23.080
Let's back out real slow.

01:46:40.464 --> 01:46:42.830
Myers, ready your grenades.

01:46:44.401 --> 01:46:47.063
Marco. Marco. Marco.

01:46:47.237 --> 01:46:49.899
Get your big, red butt over here.

01:46:56.180 --> 01:46:57.442
I'm coming for you, kid!

01:47:56.473 --> 01:47:58.668
No piggybacks!

01:48:03.614 --> 01:48:05.445
Get off me, you...

01:48:09.019 --> 01:48:10.043
Liz, no!

01:48:10.220 --> 01:48:13.053
They're gonna kill him!
Do something!

01:48:13.223 --> 01:48:14.656
What do you want me to do?

01:48:14.825 --> 01:48:15.849
- Hit me.
- What?

01:48:16.660 --> 01:48:18.025
Hit me.

01:48:19.930 --> 01:48:20.919
Now!

01:48:30.707 --> 01:48:32.937
You should be running.

01:49:43.046 --> 01:49:44.911
They are all here.

01:49:45.349 --> 01:49:46.873
All of them.

01:49:47.384 --> 01:49:50.182
Just the way it was promised.

01:49:53.890 --> 01:49:55.357
This one's awake.

01:50:00.330 --> 01:50:02.821
Thank you for this.

01:50:40.337 --> 01:50:41.929
"And I looked...

01:50:43.173 --> 01:50:44.675
...and beheld an angel.

01:50:46.176 --> 01:50:51.181
And in his right hand,
the key to the bottomless pit. "

01:50:53.684 --> 01:50:58.689
These were the words I heard
as a peasant boy in Tobolsk.

01:50:58.724 --> 01:51:01.024
And now, the door.

01:51:01.491 --> 01:51:03.721
Sent by the Ogdru Jahad...

01:51:04.327 --> 01:51:09.594
...so that they might at long last
enter our world.

01:51:09.766 --> 01:51:13.759
You are the key,
the right hand of doom.

01:51:14.738 --> 01:51:16.399
Your stone hand.

01:51:16.573 --> 01:51:18.939
What did you think it was made for?

01:51:20.944 --> 01:51:22.343
Open the locks.

01:51:22.512 --> 01:51:24.139
Don't do it, Red! Don't do it!

01:51:26.983 --> 01:51:28.245
Silence.

01:51:30.954 --> 01:51:33.479
Imagine it.

01:51:33.657 --> 01:51:35.750
An Eden...

01:51:35.926 --> 01:51:37.450
...for you and her.

01:51:37.661 --> 01:51:39.229
No.

01:51:39.730 --> 01:51:41.231
No?

01:51:43.233 --> 01:51:45.235
In exchange for her soul, then?

01:51:51.708 --> 01:51:52.868
Open the door.

01:51:54.544 --> 01:51:56.136
No.

01:51:56.947 --> 01:51:59.279
As you wish.

01:52:00.784 --> 01:52:02.684
No!

01:52:21.905 --> 01:52:23.202
Liz!

01:52:31.982 --> 01:52:34.974
Her soul awaits on the other side.

01:52:35.318 --> 01:52:37.286
If you want her back...

01:52:37.454 --> 01:52:40.082
...open the door and claim her.

01:52:44.227 --> 01:52:48.857
Your true name is inscribed
around the locks that hold you.

01:52:49.032 --> 01:52:50.522
You cannot break them...

01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:53.225
...no matter how strong you are.

01:52:53.403 --> 01:52:55.394
The eclipse has begun.

01:52:58.642 --> 01:53:00.473
Your true name...

01:53:01.578 --> 01:53:03.239
...say it!

01:53:10.220 --> 01:53:11.278
Become the key.

01:53:20.397 --> 01:53:22.388
For her.

01:53:23.800 --> 01:53:26.735
Anung un Rama.

01:53:26.903 --> 01:53:28.530
Repeat it.

01:53:28.705 --> 01:53:31.265
Anung un Rama.

01:55:56.653 --> 01:55:58.917
Open the final lock.

01:55:59.622 --> 01:56:02.318
Remember who you are!

01:56:22.645 --> 01:56:25.808
Believe me, I have lived
long enough to know...

01:56:25.982 --> 01:56:28.416
...not a tear will be shed
for this world!

01:56:28.585 --> 01:56:30.109
You have a choice.

01:56:30.286 --> 01:56:32.811
Your father gave you that.

01:56:32.989 --> 01:56:34.320
No, you don't!

01:56:34.491 --> 01:56:35.822
Open it!

01:56:38.495 --> 01:56:40.087
Do it!

01:57:04.254 --> 01:57:05.983
What have you done?

01:57:08.124 --> 01:57:09.751
I chose.

01:57:22.872 --> 01:57:25.500
You will never fulfill your destiny.

01:57:25.675 --> 01:57:29.634
You will never understand
the power inside you.

01:57:29.813 --> 01:57:32.714
I'll just have to find a way
to live with that.

01:57:44.294 --> 01:57:45.761
Child.

01:57:45.929 --> 01:57:47.521
Look what you've done.

01:57:48.298 --> 01:57:50.493
You've killed me...

01:57:51.134 --> 01:57:52.999
...an insignificant man.

01:57:53.169 --> 01:57:55.330
But you have brought forth...

01:57:56.272 --> 01:57:58.206
...a god.

01:58:06.516 --> 01:58:08.575
Myers, let's go.

01:58:27.303 --> 01:58:30.204
Hell will hold no surprises for us.

01:58:43.953 --> 01:58:45.944
I took a grenade belt.

01:58:47.724 --> 01:58:49.851
The damn thing's broken.

01:58:54.731 --> 01:58:56.892
Keep her safe, will you?

01:58:57.066 --> 01:58:59.557
Whatever happens,
don't leave her alone.

01:59:00.203 --> 01:59:01.261
I won't.

01:59:09.312 --> 01:59:11.109
You're okay, Myers.

01:59:12.015 --> 01:59:13.482
Stick around.

01:59:14.117 --> 01:59:15.880
Hey, Red.

01:59:19.289 --> 01:59:20.722
Just pull the cable.

01:59:20.890 --> 01:59:22.289
I didn't get you anything.

01:59:24.227 --> 01:59:27.390
Are you going to be okay alone?

01:59:30.466 --> 01:59:32.127
How big can it be?

01:59:39.909 --> 01:59:41.069
Damn!

01:59:58.661 --> 01:59:59.753
Damn.

02:00:49.078 --> 02:00:50.670
Oh, this is gonna hurt.

02:01:20.443 --> 02:01:22.570
Gonna be sore in the morning.

02:01:42.398 --> 02:01:44.127
She's got no pulse.

02:01:45.268 --> 02:01:46.929
She's not breathing.

02:01:57.880 --> 02:01:59.279
Liz?

02:01:59.615 --> 02:02:01.913
I was so foolish.

02:02:33.950 --> 02:02:35.247
Red.

02:02:42.525 --> 02:02:44.186
In the dark...

02:02:47.764 --> 02:02:49.823
...I heard your voice.

02:02:54.670 --> 02:02:56.433
What did you say?

02:02:58.541 --> 02:03:00.099
I said, "Hey...

02:03:01.010 --> 02:03:03.240
...you on the other side...

02:03:05.081 --> 02:03:06.742
...let her go.

02:03:08.584 --> 02:03:10.108
Because for...

02:03:17.059 --> 02:03:19.391
For her I'll cross over.

02:03:22.799 --> 02:03:25.461
And then you'll be sorry. "

02:03:45.955 --> 02:03:48.549
<i>What makes a man a man?</i>

02:03:48.858 --> 02:03:51.520
<i>A friend of mine once wondered.</i>

02:03:52.161 --> 02:03:56.222
<i>Is it his origins?
The way he comes to life?</i>

02:03:56.699 --> 02:03:58.530
<i>I don't think so.</i>

02:03:58.701 --> 02:04:00.635
<i>It's the choices he makes.</i>

02:04:00.803 --> 02:04:03.101
<i>Not how he starts things...</i>

02:04:03.272 --> 02:04:06.400
<i>...but how he decides to end them.</i>

02:06:14.303 --> 02:06:17.397
Hey, guys? I'm still here.

02:06:20.543 --> 02:06:21.874
Hello?
