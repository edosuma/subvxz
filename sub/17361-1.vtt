00:04.504 --> 00:07.541
(breathing heavily)

00:15.098 --> 00:17.214
Negan: What?

00:17.392 --> 00:19.257
Was the joke
that bad?

00:25.275 --> 00:27.266
I'm gonna kill you.

00:36.286 --> 00:38.948
What?

00:39.122 --> 00:42.239
Ididn't quite catch that.
You're gonna have to speak up.

00:48.298 --> 00:50.129
(sniffles)

00:51.134 --> 00:53.125
Not today...

00:54.137 --> 00:56.298
...not tomorrow...

00:59.476 --> 01:01.933
...but I'm gonna
kill you.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.353
(inhales sharply)

01:12.655 --> 01:13.986
Jesus.

01:15.867 --> 01:17.573
(chuckles softly)

01:17.744 --> 01:19.655
Simon...

01:20.997 --> 01:23.329
what did he have,
a knife?

01:24.709 --> 01:27.371
Simon:
Uh, he had a hatchet.

01:29.214 --> 01:31.170
A hatchet?

01:31.341 --> 01:33.832
He had an ax.

01:35.220 --> 01:37.006
(chuckles)

01:38.598 --> 01:41.556
Simon's my right-hand man.

01:41.726 --> 01:44.183
Having one of those
is important.

01:44.354 --> 01:47.221
I mean, what do you have left
without them?

01:47.398 --> 01:50.526
A whole lot of work.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.945
Do you have one?

01:53.113 --> 01:55.946
Maybe one of these fine people
still breathing?

01:58.243 --> 01:59.699
Oh.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.450
Or did I...

02:01.621 --> 02:03.361
(clicks tongue)

02:12.257 --> 02:14.339
(sighs)

02:15.635 --> 02:17.296
Sure.

02:17.470 --> 02:19.882
Yeah.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.967
Give me his ax.

02:24.644 --> 02:27.260
(footsteps approach)

02:55.758 --> 02:57.168
(inhales deeply)

02:57.343 --> 02:59.004
I'll be right back.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.919
Maybe Rick
will be with me.

03:01.097 --> 03:02.257
And if not, well,

03:02.432 --> 03:05.174
we can just turn these people
inside out, won't we?

03:06.519 --> 03:09.761
I mean...
the ones that are left.

03:09.939 --> 03:13.727
(sobbing)

03:25.163 --> 03:28.030
(music playing)

04:05.245 --> 04:08.282
(grunting)

04:08.456 --> 04:10.287
(breathing heavily)

04:10.458 --> 04:12.198
(both grunt)

04:12.377 --> 04:14.584
(sighs)

04:25.390 --> 04:28.177
(sighs)
Let's go for a ride.

04:28.351 --> 04:31.684
(engine sputtering)

04:36.150 --> 04:37.435
Wow.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.771
What a piece of shit.

04:42.865 --> 04:44.605
"I'm gonna kill you."

04:44.784 --> 04:46.615
(chuckles)

04:46.786 --> 04:48.822
Are you kiddin' me?

04:48.997 --> 04:51.238
Did you see what just happened,
what ljust did?

04:51.416 --> 04:53.122
You just...

04:53.293 --> 04:55.124
(sighs)

04:55.295 --> 04:56.876
(scoffs)

04:57.046 --> 04:58.877
Your best chance...

04:59.048 --> 05:02.085
is to stand up,
grab that ax,

05:02.260 --> 05:04.501
and drive it through
the back of my head.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.262
See how you do.

05:09.726 --> 05:12.388
Keep actin' tough.

05:12.562 --> 05:14.553
Go ahead.

05:14.731 --> 05:17.097
Grab the damn ax.

05:19.569 --> 05:20.934
(chuckles)

05:24.741 --> 05:26.481
Drop it.

05:34.459 --> 05:36.745
(grunts)

05:36.919 --> 05:39.331
(gasping)

05:39.505 --> 05:41.996
Ohh.

05:44.344 --> 05:45.959
(ax clangs)

05:46.137 --> 05:48.503
Don't make me
get up again.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.093
Well, look at that.

05:55.271 --> 05:58.138
Dawn is breakin'.

05:58.316 --> 06:01.649
It's a brand-new day,
Rick.

06:01.819 --> 06:04.310
(chuckles)

06:04.489 --> 06:07.356
I want you to think about
what could have happened...

06:08.951 --> 06:11.078
...think about
what happened,

06:11.245 --> 06:14.954
and think about
what can still happen.

06:17.502 --> 06:20.915
(engine starts, revs)

06:36.646 --> 06:38.136
(walker growls)

06:38.314 --> 06:40.100
(laughing)
Oh! Boom!

06:40.274 --> 06:42.185
(laughs)

06:42.360 --> 06:44.271
That remind you
of anybody you know?

06:44.445 --> 06:46.561
(laughs)

06:46.739 --> 06:48.115
Oh, yeah.

06:48.282 --> 06:50.022
(growling continues)

06:50.201 --> 06:51.486
ï¬‚huds)

06:54.080 --> 06:57.413
(thud, brakes squeal)

06:59.293 --> 07:02.706
(engine shuts off,
keys jingle)

07:02.880 --> 07:05.132
(walkers growling)

07:12.473 --> 07:14.509
You are mine.

07:14.684 --> 07:19.178
The people back there --
they are mine.

07:20.523 --> 07:21.979
This...

07:24.360 --> 07:26.817
This is mine.

07:26.988 --> 07:30.401
(growling continues)

07:36.372 --> 07:39.705
(growling continues)

07:41.544 --> 07:42.624
(grunts)

07:42.795 --> 07:46.253
(growling continues)

07:49.010 --> 07:51.251
(ax clatters)

07:52.263 --> 07:54.549
Hey, Rick...

07:54.724 --> 07:57.215
go get my ax.

07:57.393 --> 07:59.179
Let's be friends.

08:02.607 --> 08:03.847
(walker growling loudly)

08:04.942 --> 08:08.150
Oh. (chuckles)

08:09.447 --> 08:12.029
(Negan sighs)

08:17.955 --> 08:20.116
Get my ax.

08:30.176 --> 08:31.962
(grunts)

08:33.721 --> 08:35.632
(door slams)

08:36.974 --> 08:40.762
(walkers growling)

08:42.939 --> 08:44.270
Aah!

08:44.440 --> 08:45.771
Aah!

08:45.942 --> 08:48.684
Aah!

09:00.873 --> 09:04.365
(growls)

09:07.004 --> 09:09.040
(grunting)

09:09.215 --> 09:12.127
(walkers growling)

09:15.513 --> 09:17.219
Ohh!

09:17.390 --> 09:19.802
- (grunting)
- (growling)

09:22.353 --> 09:23.968
(grunts)

09:24.146 --> 09:25.977
(growling)

09:26.148 --> 09:27.684
(grunts)

09:27.858 --> 09:30.941
(walkers growling)

09:45.334 --> 09:48.667
(wind rushing)

10:03.019 --> 10:06.352
(walkers growling)

10:06.522 --> 10:10.185
(music playing)

10:33.049 --> 10:35.586
(music continues)

11:07.917 --> 11:11.535
Negan: Bet you thought you were
all gonna grow old together,

11:11.712 --> 11:13.953
sittin' around the table
at Sunday dinner

11:14.131 --> 11:16.964
in the happily ever after.

11:17.134 --> 11:18.385
No.

11:18.552 --> 11:20.508
Doesn't work like that, Rick.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.965
(walkers growling)

11:22.139 --> 11:24.221
Not anymore.

11:24.392 --> 11:27.225
Think about what happened.

11:30.272 --> 11:33.605
(walkers growling)

11:40.449 --> 11:42.314
(Negan's voice echoing)
I simply cannot decide.

11:44.036 --> 11:46.448
(chuckles)

11:57.049 --> 11:59.461
Negan:
lgotanidea.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.974
Eenie...

12:10.980 --> 12:12.811

12:12.982 --> 12:14.893

12:17.987 --> 12:19.943

12:21.991 --> 12:23.777
a tiger...

12:24.994 --> 12:26.655
by...

12:26.829 --> 12:29.286
his toe.

12:29.457 --> 12:30.742
If...

12:30.916 --> 12:33.168
he hollers...

12:35.671 --> 12:37.832
let him go.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.998
My mother...

12:40.176 --> 12:43.168
told me...

12:45.639 --> 12:47.800
to pick...

12:47.975 --> 12:49.681
the very...

12:49.852 --> 12:51.262
best...

12:51.437 --> 12:52.643
one...

12:55.608 --> 12:59.192
and you...

12:59.361 --> 13:02.444
are...

13:26.472 --> 13:28.178
...it.

13:28.349 --> 13:31.056
Negan: Anybody moves,
anybody says anything,

13:31.227 --> 13:33.889
cut the boy's other eye out
and feed it to his father,

13:34.063 --> 13:35.894
and then we'll start.

13:36.065 --> 13:38.977
You can breathe.
You can blink.

13:39.151 --> 13:41.688
You can cry.

13:44.740 --> 13:47.277
Hell, you're all
gonna be doing that.

13:47.451 --> 13:49.567
(thud echoes)

13:50.830 --> 13:52.240
Oh!

13:52.414 --> 13:53.574
Look at that!

13:53.749 --> 13:55.910
Taking it
like a champ!

13:56.085 --> 13:58.076
Suck...

13:58.254 --> 13:59.790
my...

13:59.964 --> 14:01.625
nuts.

14:03.926 --> 14:05.086
(thud echoes)

14:08.138 --> 14:11.426
(echoing blows landing)

14:11.600 --> 14:15.343
(walkers growling)

14:17.481 --> 14:18.766
Negan:
Did you hear that?

14:18.941 --> 14:20.101
(chuckles)

14:20.276 --> 14:23.689
He said, "Suck my nuts."

14:23.863 --> 14:25.023
Phew.

14:25.197 --> 14:28.781
(laughs)

14:28.951 --> 14:31.192
- (blows landing)
- (grunting)

14:31.370 --> 14:34.783
(crying)

14:34.957 --> 14:39.291
(blows continue landing)

14:39.461 --> 14:41.417
(grunting continues)

14:52.266 --> 14:55.133
- (man groans)
- (Negan laughs)

14:55.311 --> 14:59.771
Oh, my goodness!

14:59.940 --> 15:01.396
Look at this!

15:01.567 --> 15:02.977
(blood splatters)

15:03.152 --> 15:05.143
(laughs)

15:05.321 --> 15:09.815
You guys,
look at my dirty girl!

15:17.249 --> 15:20.036
Sweetheart...

15:20.210 --> 15:23.919
Lay your eyes
on this.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.341
(sighs heavily)

15:27.843 --> 15:29.583
Oh, damn.

15:31.221 --> 15:32.381
Were you--

15:32.556 --> 15:35.013
were you together?

15:35.184 --> 15:36.390
That sucks.

15:37.770 --> 15:40.102
But if you were,
you should know

15:40.272 --> 15:42.649
there was a reason
for all this.

15:42.816 --> 15:45.808
Red--
and hell, he was, is,

15:45.986 --> 15:47.567
and will ever be red.

15:47.738 --> 15:52.198
He just took one
or six or seven for the team!

15:54.870 --> 15:58.488
So take... a damn look.

15:58.666 --> 16:00.657
(breathing shakily)

16:03.295 --> 16:04.626
Take a damn look!

16:04.797 --> 16:07.539
(grunting)

16:11.720 --> 16:12.709
Rick: Daryl!

16:12.888 --> 16:14.719
No!

16:16.892 --> 16:18.928
Oh, no.

16:24.066 --> 16:27.149
(chuckles)

16:27.319 --> 16:29.310
That?

16:29.488 --> 16:32.104
Oh, my!

16:32.282 --> 16:34.318
That...

16:34.493 --> 16:36.233
is a no-no.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.324
The whole thing--

16:39.498 --> 16:43.958
not one bit of that shit
flies here.

16:44.128 --> 16:46.540
(woman crying)

16:50.926 --> 16:52.962
Do you want me
to do it?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.718
Right here.

16:56.265 --> 16:58.677
(grunting)

17:00.352 --> 17:02.058
No.

17:02.229 --> 17:05.062
No,
you don't kill them...

17:05.232 --> 17:07.439
not until
you try a little.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.273
(grunting)

17:18.871 --> 17:20.327
And anyway...

17:22.541 --> 17:24.782
that's not
how it works.

17:24.960 --> 17:27.952
Now,
I already told you people,

17:28.130 --> 17:31.293
first one's free.
Then what'd I say?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.674
I said I would
shut that shit down!

17:35.804 --> 17:38.386
No exceptions.

17:38.557 --> 17:41.390
Now, I don't know
what kind of lying assholes

17:41.560 --> 17:43.767
you've been dealing with...

17:45.564 --> 17:47.475
but I'm a man
of my word.

17:48.650 --> 17:50.606
First impressions
are important.

17:55.324 --> 17:59.067
I need you to know me.

18:02.664 --> 18:04.529
So...

18:07.711 --> 18:09.747
back to it.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.038
(all gasping)

18:13.592 --> 18:15.958
Maggie: No!

18:16.136 --> 18:19.219
(groaning, gasping)

18:29.191 --> 18:32.604
(walkers growling)

18:33.612 --> 18:35.694
Buddy,

18:35.864 --> 18:37.400
(grunting, sputtering)

18:37.574 --> 18:38.905
ljust don't know.

18:39.076 --> 18:41.863
It seems like
you're trying to speak,

18:42.037 --> 18:44.619
but you just took
a hell of a hit.

18:44.790 --> 18:47.532
ljust popped your skull
so hard,

18:47.709 --> 18:49.700
youreyebaH
just popped out,

18:49.878 --> 18:52.995
and it is
gross as shit!

18:53.173 --> 18:56.757
Maggie, I'll find you.

18:59.054 --> 19:01.887
(sobbing)

19:02.057 --> 19:05.549
(grunting)

19:05.727 --> 19:09.811
Oh.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.813
Oh, hell.

19:15.404 --> 19:17.941
I can see this is hard
on you guys.

19:18.115 --> 19:20.447
(grunting continues)

19:20.617 --> 19:22.994
I am sorry.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.118
I truly am.

19:26.582 --> 19:28.538
But I did say it.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.951
No exceptions!
(grunts)

19:33.172 --> 19:35.788
(walkers growling)

19:37.301 --> 19:39.758
(blows landing)

19:39.928 --> 19:42.089
(thudding, squelching)

19:42.264 --> 19:46.758
(all sobbing)

19:55.527 --> 19:56.983
(walkers growling)

19:57.154 --> 19:59.896
You bunch of pussies.

20:02.576 --> 20:05.158
I'm just getting started.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.445
(grunting)

20:07.623 --> 20:11.332
(blows landing)

20:11.501 --> 20:15.710
Lucille is thirsty.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.167
(laughs)

20:18.342 --> 20:20.754
She is a vampire bat.

20:20.928 --> 20:23.385
(sobbing continues)

20:24.932 --> 20:27.264
(breathing shakily)

20:49.456 --> 20:51.822
What?

20:52.000 --> 20:53.865
Was the joke
that bad?

20:54.044 --> 20:55.580
(thumping)

20:55.754 --> 20:57.540
(walkers growling)

20:57.714 --> 21:00.046
Negan:
People died, Rick.

21:00.217 --> 21:02.048
It's what happened.

21:02.219 --> 21:04.881
Doesn't mean
the rest of them have to.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.170
(growling continues)

21:06.348 --> 21:08.384
Get me my ax.

21:09.643 --> 21:13.227
Get me... my... ax!

21:17.651 --> 21:20.063
(walkers growling)

21:22.572 --> 21:24.824
Negan: lthought
you were the guy, Rick.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.357
Maybe you're not.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.821
We'll give it
one more go.

21:28.996 --> 21:33.410
Now, I really want you
to try this time.

21:33.583 --> 21:35.835
Last chance.

21:36.003 --> 21:38.210
Bring me my ax!

21:38.380 --> 21:39.961
(gunshots)

21:44.970 --> 21:48.212
(growling continues)

21:49.224 --> 21:51.556
(growling)

21:51.727 --> 21:53.809
(groaning)

21:53.979 --> 21:55.640
(growling)

21:55.814 --> 21:59.147
Aah!

22:06.033 --> 22:08.775
Aah!

22:11.455 --> 22:13.696
Help!

22:13.874 --> 22:15.410
(growling continues)

22:15.584 --> 22:18.667
(gunfire)

22:23.008 --> 22:24.123
Aah!

22:24.301 --> 22:25.541
(gunfire continues)

22:28.055 --> 22:31.013
Clock is ticking, Rick!

22:32.184 --> 22:35.392
Think about
what can still happen.

22:39.524 --> 22:40.980
(grunts)

22:41.151 --> 22:43.893
(walkers growling)

22:55.457 --> 22:57.288
(growls)

22:57.459 --> 22:59.290
(grunts)

22:59.461 --> 23:01.372
(sighs heavily)

23:01.546 --> 23:02.956
(growling)

23:05.550 --> 23:07.461
(horn honking)

23:07.636 --> 23:10.048
(grunting)

23:16.520 --> 23:17.635
(grunting)

23:20.023 --> 23:23.607
(grunts)

23:31.159 --> 23:32.990
(grunting)

23:47.884 --> 23:50.626
(walkers growling)

23:54.891 --> 23:58.224
(Rick breathing heavily)

24:15.036 --> 24:17.118
Attaboy!

24:21.585 --> 24:24.873
(walkers growling)

24:25.046 --> 24:27.037
(breathing heavily)

24:27.215 --> 24:29.171
(growling fades)

24:32.929 --> 24:35.181
(engine starts)

24:51.531 --> 24:54.694
(brakes squeal)

24:54.868 --> 24:57.905
(engine stops)

24:58.079 --> 25:01.242
(keys jingling)

25:01.416 --> 25:04.078
(claps hands)

25:04.252 --> 25:06.243
We're here, prick.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.382
(scoffs)

25:15.013 --> 25:18.676
This must be hard for you,
right?

25:18.850 --> 25:23.389
I mean, you have been King Shit
for so long.

25:29.277 --> 25:31.108
Losin' two of your own
like...

25:31.279 --> 25:33.611
(snaps fingers)

25:33.782 --> 25:36.819
Gettin' 'em clipped like that,
one nut, then the other,

25:36.993 --> 25:39.109
and in front
of your boy?

25:39.287 --> 25:44.122
That is
some screwed-up shit!

25:44.292 --> 25:46.283
Ah.

25:47.462 --> 25:50.499
Oh.

25:50.674 --> 25:52.130
Goody.

25:54.219 --> 25:55.834
(cap clatters)

25:56.012 --> 25:58.879
(sighs)

26:00.892 --> 26:03.053
You were in charge.

26:03.228 --> 26:05.093
(Negan grunts)

26:07.482 --> 26:08.767
Hell...

26:10.777 --> 26:13.234
you were probably...

26:13.405 --> 26:15.612
addicted to it.

26:15.782 --> 26:21.197
And now, well, clip, clip--
that's over.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.788
But...

26:29.087 --> 26:31.499
you can still lead...

26:31.673 --> 26:35.791
a nice, productive life
producing for me.

26:46.187 --> 26:48.348
I think
you're gonna need it.

26:51.693 --> 26:54.810
| just got a feelin'.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.275
(sighs)

27:03.038 --> 27:05.529
So take it.

27:13.298 --> 27:16.631
(breathing heavily)

27:23.892 --> 27:25.883
Here we are.

27:27.562 --> 27:28.893
Let me ask you something,
Rick.

27:29.064 --> 27:32.727
Do you even know
what that little trip was about?

27:42.577 --> 27:44.238
Negan:
Speak when you're spoken to.

27:44.412 --> 27:46.573
(breathing heavily)

27:48.583 --> 27:50.915
Okay. Okay.

27:53.588 --> 27:54.748
That trip was about

27:54.923 --> 27:57.380
the way
that you looked at me.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.711
I wanted
to change that.

27:59.886 --> 28:02.468
I wanted you
to understand.

28:04.349 --> 28:08.183
But you're still looking at me
the same damn way...

28:09.771 --> 28:11.762
like I shit
in your scrambled eggs,

28:11.940 --> 28:14.602
and that's not
gonna work.

28:14.776 --> 28:16.516
So...

28:20.949 --> 28:24.032
do I give you
another chance?

28:24.202 --> 28:26.363
(breathing raggedly)

28:28.456 --> 28:29.992
Yeah.

28:30.166 --> 28:32.623
Yes.

28:32.794 --> 28:35.126
Yes.

28:35.296 --> 28:36.456
Okay.

28:36.631 --> 28:39.464
(chucang)
All right.

28:39.634 --> 28:44.128
And here it is,
the grand-prize game.

28:44.305 --> 28:49.015
What you do next will decide
whether your crap day

28:49.185 --> 28:52.643
becomes everyone's
last crap day

28:52.814 --> 28:55.977
orjust
another crap day.

28:58.528 --> 29:02.237
Get some guns
to the back of their heads.

29:03.908 --> 29:07.241
(guns cocking)

29:11.332 --> 29:14.119
Good. Now...

29:14.294 --> 29:18.333
level with their noses,
so if you have to fire...

29:18.506 --> 29:20.121
(imitates explosion)

29:20.300 --> 29:23.633
...it'll be a real mess.

29:33.772 --> 29:34.978
Kid...

29:39.694 --> 29:41.309
Right here.

29:43.490 --> 29:46.903
Kid... now.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.826
You a southpaw?

29:58.004 --> 29:59.869
Am I a what?

30:00.048 --> 30:02.755
You a lefty?

30:02.926 --> 30:04.006
No.

30:04.177 --> 30:06.213
Good.

30:12.352 --> 30:13.762
That hurt?

30:13.937 --> 30:15.518
No.

30:15.688 --> 30:17.940
It should.

30:18.107 --> 30:21.190
It's supposed to.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.567
All right.

30:22.737 --> 30:26.355
Get down on the ground, kid,
next to Daddy.

30:26.533 --> 30:28.615
Spread them wings.

30:39.128 --> 30:40.538
Simon...

30:42.966 --> 30:44.251
you got a pen?

30:44.425 --> 30:47.007
Yeah.

30:58.773 --> 31:00.104
(grunts)

31:00.275 --> 31:02.516
Sorry, kid.

31:02.694 --> 31:05.936
This is gonna be
as cold as a warlock's ballsack,

31:06.114 --> 31:08.150
just like he was
hanging his ballsack above you

31:08.324 --> 31:12.488
and dragging it
right across the forearm.

31:12.662 --> 31:14.072
There you go.

31:14.247 --> 31:16.659
Gives you
a little leverage.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.039
Please. Please.

31:18.209 --> 31:19.289
Please don't.

31:19.460 --> 31:20.711
Please don't.

31:22.714 --> 31:24.329
Me?

31:24.507 --> 31:26.964
(chuckles)

31:27.135 --> 31:29.171
I ain't doing shit.

31:32.515 --> 31:33.630
Ahh.

31:33.808 --> 31:36.641
Rick, I want you
to take your ax...

31:36.811 --> 31:38.927
cut your son's
left arm off,

31:39.105 --> 31:40.345
right on that line.

31:40.523 --> 31:43.139
Now, I know,
I know.

31:43.318 --> 31:45.604
You're gonna have to
process that for a second.

31:45.778 --> 31:46.984
That makes sense.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.942
Still, though,
I'm gonna need you to do it,

31:50.116 --> 31:52.323
or all these people
are gonna die.

31:52.493 --> 31:54.154
Then Carl dies,

31:54.329 --> 31:57.867
then the people
back home die...

31:58.041 --> 32:01.329
and then you,
eventually.

32:01.502 --> 32:03.663
I'm gonna keep you breathing
for a few years,

32:03.838 --> 32:05.624
just so
you can stew on it.

32:05.798 --> 32:07.129
Michonne:
You-- you don't have to do this.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.506
We understand.

32:08.676 --> 32:09.927
We understand.

32:10.094 --> 32:11.630
Negan:
You understand.

32:13.014 --> 32:14.254
Yeah.

32:14.432 --> 32:17.094
I'm not sure
that Rick does.

32:18.686 --> 32:20.096
I'm gonna need
a clean cut

32:20.271 --> 32:21.602
right there
on that line.

32:21.773 --> 32:24.059
Now, I know this is
a screwed-up thing to ask,

32:24.233 --> 32:27.396
but it's gonna have to be
like a salami slice--

32:27.570 --> 32:29.902
nothing messy,
clean, 45 degrees--

32:30.073 --> 32:31.734
give us something
to fold over.

32:31.908 --> 32:33.068
We got
a great doctor.

32:33.242 --> 32:35.278
The kid'll be fine.

32:35.453 --> 32:37.239
Probably.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.788
Rick...

32:42.377 --> 32:45.119
this needs
to happen now--

32:45.296 --> 32:46.536
chop,chopn

32:46.714 --> 32:50.298
or I will crush
the little fella's skull myself.

32:50.468 --> 32:53.084
It can-- it can--
it can be me.

32:53.262 --> 32:54.877
It can be me.

32:55.056 --> 32:56.171
W-w--
(sniffles)

32:56.349 --> 32:58.089
Y-you could do it
to me.

32:58.267 --> 33:01.100
l c-- I can go
with-- with you.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.555
No.

33:02.730 --> 33:06.188
This is the only way.

33:06.359 --> 33:07.565
Rick...

33:07.735 --> 33:10.602
pick up the ax.

33:13.741 --> 33:15.902
Not making a decision

33:16.077 --> 33:19.444
is a big decision.

33:19.622 --> 33:21.908
You really want to see
all these people die?

33:22.083 --> 33:23.414
You will.

33:23.584 --> 33:27.543
You will see
every ugly thing.

33:30.383 --> 33:31.873
- Oh, my God.
- (Rick groans)

33:32.051 --> 33:33.916
Are you
gonna make me count?

33:34.095 --> 33:35.756
Okay, Rick.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.215
You win.

33:37.390 --> 33:39.096
lam counting.

33:39.267 --> 33:41.098
- Three!
- Please.

33:41.269 --> 33:42.509
(crying)
Please.

33:42.687 --> 33:44.769
(QaSping)
It can be me.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.224
Please!

33:46.399 --> 33:47.809
(crying)

33:47.984 --> 33:49.099
Two!

33:49.277 --> 33:50.642
Please, don't do--

33:50.820 --> 33:52.811
(sobbing)

33:56.534 --> 33:58.775
This is it.

33:58.953 --> 34:01.285
Aaah!

34:01.456 --> 34:04.163
- One.
- (sobbing)

34:05.293 --> 34:07.454
(sobs)

34:07.628 --> 34:10.461
Dad...
just do it.

34:10.631 --> 34:12.337
Just do it.

34:15.386 --> 34:16.671
(sobbing)

34:22.643 --> 34:24.179
(sobbing)

34:26.022 --> 34:27.011
(breathing heavily)

34:27.190 --> 34:29.522
You answer to me.

34:29.692 --> 34:31.648
You provide for me.

34:31.819 --> 34:33.525
You belong to me.

34:33.696 --> 34:35.072
Right?

34:37.867 --> 34:39.949
Speak when
you're spoken to!

34:41.537 --> 34:42.993
You answer to me.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.404
You provide for me.

34:44.582 --> 34:46.197
Provide for you.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.663
You belong to me,
right?!

34:49.837 --> 34:52.920
(breathing heavily)
Right.

34:54.509 --> 34:56.670
Right.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.176
That...

34:59.347 --> 35:02.464
is the look
I wanted to see.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.526
We did it...

35:16.697 --> 35:20.440
all of us, together.

35:20.618 --> 35:21.824
Even the dead guys
on the ground.

35:21.994 --> 35:25.578
Hell, they get
the spirit award, for sure.

35:25.748 --> 35:27.204
(sighs)

35:27.375 --> 35:32.711
Today was
a productive damn day!

35:32.880 --> 35:34.541
(sighs)

35:34.715 --> 35:39.209
Now, I hope,
for all your sake...

35:39.387 --> 35:41.218
that you get it now...

35:42.306 --> 35:46.390
that you understand
how things work.

35:50.898 --> 35:53.389
Things have changed.

35:53.568 --> 35:56.560
Whatever you had
going for you...

35:57.572 --> 36:00.405
that is over now.

36:01.951 --> 36:04.533
Ah.
Dwight...

36:06.289 --> 36:07.369
load him up.

36:26.142 --> 36:27.848
(vehicle doors close)

36:28.019 --> 36:30.101
He's got guts.

36:30.271 --> 36:33.684
Not a little bitch
like someone I know.

36:33.858 --> 36:35.098
I like him.

36:35.276 --> 36:36.516
He's mine now.

36:36.694 --> 36:39.481
But you still
want to try something?

36:39.655 --> 36:40.644
"Not today,
not tomorrow."

36:40.823 --> 36:41.983
"Not today,
not tomorrow"?

36:42.158 --> 36:44.194
I will cut pieces
off of...

36:46.787 --> 36:47.947
Hell's his name?

36:48.122 --> 36:50.329
Daryl.

36:50.499 --> 36:51.579
Wow.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.366
That actually sounds right.

36:53.544 --> 36:55.375
I will cut
pieces off of Daryl

36:55.546 --> 36:57.332
and put them
on your doorstep--

36:57.506 --> 37:01.340
or, better yet,
I will bring him to you

37:01.510 --> 37:04.877
and have you
do it for me.

37:08.392 --> 37:11.225
(chuckles)

37:11.395 --> 37:12.851
Ahh!

37:13.022 --> 37:16.890
Welcome to a brand-new
beginning, you sorry shits!

37:18.903 --> 37:20.768
I'm gonna leave you a truck.

37:20.947 --> 37:22.437
Keep it.

37:22.615 --> 37:26.984
Use it to cart all the crap
you're gonna find me.

37:27.161 --> 37:29.527
We'll be back for
our first offering in one week.

37:29.705 --> 37:31.115
Until then...

37:31.290 --> 37:32.871
ta-ta.

37:44.053 --> 37:47.216
(music playing)

39:03.299 --> 39:05.381
(insects chirping)

39:22.693 --> 39:25.856
Rick:
Maggie. Maggie.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.191
(sobs)

39:30.159 --> 39:32.866
Maggie...

39:33.037 --> 39:34.618
you need to sit down.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.154
Maggie.

39:36.332 --> 39:38.539
No.

39:40.669 --> 39:42.205
We need to get you
to the Hilltop.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.665
You need to go
get ready.

39:43.839 --> 39:46.046
For what?

39:48.386 --> 39:50.877
To fight them.

39:58.604 --> 39:59.935
They have Daryl.

40:00.106 --> 40:01.391
They have an army.

40:01.565 --> 40:02.896
(breathing heavily)

40:03.067 --> 40:05.274
We would die,
all of us.

40:07.196 --> 40:08.732
Go home.

40:11.534 --> 40:15.243
(voice breaking)
Take everybody with you.

40:15.413 --> 40:16.903
I can get there
by myself.

40:17.081 --> 40:18.537
You can barely
stand up.

40:18.707 --> 40:20.243
I need to go.

40:20.418 --> 40:22.750
You need to go
to Alexandria.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.330
(Maggie breathing heavily)

40:31.095 --> 40:34.132
You were out--
out here for me.

40:35.641 --> 40:37.256
We still are.

40:39.895 --> 40:42.432
(sobbing)

40:47.445 --> 40:48.730
I can make it now.

40:48.904 --> 40:49.893
I need you to go back.

40:50.072 --> 40:51.061
I can't have you out here.

40:51.240 --> 40:53.105
lcan't have you all
out here anymore.

40:53.284 --> 40:55.900
I need you to go back.

41:02.918 --> 41:05.375
Maggie...

41:05.546 --> 41:07.832
we're not letting
you go.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.372
Okay?

41:09.550 --> 41:10.710
You have to.

41:10.885 --> 41:12.295
(sighs)

41:12.470 --> 41:15.462
It's not gonna happen.

41:19.643 --> 41:21.895
(breathing heavily)

41:23.564 --> 41:26.226
I'm taking her.

41:27.860 --> 41:30.192
I'm gonna get
her there.

41:30.362 --> 41:32.774
I'm gonna keep
her safe.

41:38.412 --> 41:40.323
I'm not giving you
a choice.

41:40.498 --> 41:43.365
I'm taking him
with me.

41:47.087 --> 41:49.499
(groans)

42:02.436 --> 42:05.143
I'm gonna take him.

42:06.440 --> 42:09.182
(voice breaking)
That's what I'm gonna do.

42:09.360 --> 42:12.602
- (sniffles)
- (exhales sharply)

42:17.451 --> 42:20.909
(breathing heavily)

42:26.877 --> 42:30.290
I need to do this.
Please.

42:30.464 --> 42:33.501
We need to help you.

42:33.676 --> 42:37.464
I got it.

42:37.638 --> 42:38.844
I got it.

42:39.014 --> 42:41.630
No. No.

42:41.809 --> 42:45.301
Pl-- pl--
please let us.

42:50.234 --> 42:52.316
He-- he's our family, t--

42:52.486 --> 42:54.568
he's our family, too.

42:54.738 --> 42:59.698
(music playing)

42:59.868 --> 43:01.779
(sobbing)

43:01.954 --> 43:03.114
You're okay.

43:07.960 --> 43:09.575
All right.
On three.

43:09.753 --> 43:10.868
One, two...

43:11.046 --> 43:14.379
(sobbing continues)

43:23.183 --> 43:25.310
Yeah.

43:26.604 --> 43:29.971
Negan: Bet you thought you were
all gonna grow old together,

43:30.149 --> 43:32.481
sittin' around the table
at Sunday dinner

43:32.651 --> 43:35.267
in the happily ever after.

43:35.446 --> 43:37.152
No.

43:37.323 --> 43:40.406
Doesn't work like that, Rick.

43:40.576 --> 43:42.567
Not anymore.

43:42.745 --> 43:46.613
(music playing)

44:15.069 --> 44:17.560
(walker growling)

44:38.884 --> 44:41.717
(engine starts)

44:53.607 --> 44:56.724
(growling continues)

45:26.390 --> 45:30.383
(music playing)
