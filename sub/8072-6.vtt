[video game sounds]

00:10.311 --> 00:11.745
Hiyah!

00:11.779 --> 00:12.746
Hiyah!

00:12.780 --> 00:15.216
Ooh-ha!

00:15.249 --> 00:17.251
[video game sounds]

00:17.285 --> 00:18.519
That was fun.

00:18.552 --> 00:20.221
You're a way better
babysitter than Darlene.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.155
Oh yeah?

00:21.189 --> 00:24.925
Yeah, you let
me out of my room.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.094
Hey, I love these games.

00:26.127 --> 00:28.662
We used to play them all
the time back in Iowa.

00:28.696 --> 00:30.064
Without electricity?

00:30.098 --> 00:32.900
What?

00:32.933 --> 00:34.968
Darlene says there's
no electricity or lights

00:35.002 --> 00:36.704
where you come
from, but that's OK

00:36.737 --> 00:40.274
because you can't read anyway.

00:40.308 --> 00:42.710
Oh, yeah, well,
what else did she say?

00:42.743 --> 00:44.612
You guys keep
chickens in your kitchen

00:44.645 --> 00:46.714
and kill them with
your bare hands.

00:46.747 --> 00:48.149
Oh really?

00:48.182 --> 00:49.150
Yeah.

00:49.183 --> 00:51.385
Well, there's one
part I don't get.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.254
How can someone's
sister be their mom?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.259
Hey.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.460
Hey.

00:59.493 --> 01:00.361
Hi, Molly.

01:00.394 --> 01:03.164
Hi, David.

01:03.197 --> 01:05.566
You can go now.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.402
OK, um, just tell your
mom she can pay me tomorrow.

01:08.436 --> 01:09.970
What, you didn't
get the money upfront?

01:10.003 --> 01:12.573
Well, you'll learn.

01:12.606 --> 01:14.575
Well, she better pay,
because we're saving up

01:14.608 --> 01:17.845
so we can get us one of
them talking picture boxes.

01:17.878 --> 01:19.513
Excuse me?

01:19.547 --> 01:21.415
Oh, you know now that
we got electricity.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.421
Bye-bye now.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.022
Why thank you, David.

01:29.056 --> 01:29.890
Sleep tight.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.131
You're about to become a
strange smell in the attic.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.173
What are you smiling about?

01:45.206 --> 01:47.141
(LAUGHING) Nothing.

01:47.175 --> 01:48.576
Oh, come on.

01:48.609 --> 01:51.845
You don't go for that flirty,
cutesy Barbie doll crap, do ya?

01:51.879 --> 01:53.247
I mean, she was so obvious.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.482
I don't know.

01:54.515 --> 01:56.617
I guess for some guys, it'd
probably make them feel,

01:56.650 --> 01:58.219
you know, like a man.

02:03.624 --> 02:07.595
I can make you feel
like a man, David.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.462
Take out the trash.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.272
[theme music]

02:56.310 --> 02:58.712
[laughs]

03:03.284 --> 03:06.287
We're back!

03:06.320 --> 03:07.688
Come on, come on,
I've been holding it

03:07.721 --> 03:09.257
in since the
Illinois state line.

03:09.290 --> 03:14.228
Hey, you drink the big gulp,
you suffer the consequences.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.329
What a riot.

03:15.363 --> 03:17.030
I haven't been in the
flatbed of a pickup

03:17.064 --> 03:19.132
since I don't know when.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.768
It's a totally different
experience sitting up,

03:20.801 --> 03:22.135
ain't it, Jackie?

03:24.638 --> 03:25.506
Darlene!

03:25.539 --> 03:27.375
DJ!

03:27.408 --> 03:29.977
Here it is,
Iowa's best-selling

03:30.010 --> 03:31.545
sandwich comes to Lanford.

03:31.579 --> 03:32.880
Onasis had ships.

03:32.913 --> 03:34.315
Hilton Head hotels.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.416
We got loose meat.

03:35.449 --> 03:37.217
[laughs]

03:38.719 --> 03:40.020
What reeks?

03:40.053 --> 03:42.556
Your future.

03:42.590 --> 03:47.227
Yeah, that smells about right.

03:47.261 --> 03:48.762
I can't believe you
guys drove all that way

03:48.796 --> 03:50.464
just to copy some greasy diner.

03:50.498 --> 03:52.933
Well, if we're gonna be
successful in business,

03:52.966 --> 03:56.203
we're gonna have to steal
the idea from somebody.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.771
You should've
seen it, Darlene.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.640
People were shoving
loose meat in their faces

03:59.673 --> 04:02.343
as fast as they could
get their hands on it.

04:02.376 --> 04:04.645
Well, why not just drop
a carcass on the table

04:04.678 --> 04:05.779
and let them gnaw
till they're full?

04:08.549 --> 04:13.854
Hey, don't step
on my buzz, OK?

04:13.887 --> 04:15.122
This means a lot to me.

04:15.155 --> 04:17.157
I would like to have
something to show for my life

04:17.190 --> 04:20.394
besides stretchmarks.

04:20.428 --> 04:21.495
I'm sorry.

04:21.529 --> 04:22.863
I just can't believe
we're gonna make money

04:22.896 --> 04:24.732
by clogging people's
arteries with the fat

04:24.765 --> 04:27.535
of poor slaughtered animals.

04:27.568 --> 04:30.404
Cool, isn't it?

04:30.438 --> 04:32.473
Yeah, don't knock it till
you've tried it, Darlene.

04:32.506 --> 04:33.374
Come on.

04:33.407 --> 04:35.743
Take a bite for Daddy.

04:35.776 --> 04:36.644
Yoohoo.

04:36.677 --> 04:37.811
Come on, Darlene.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.580
All the really cool
kids are doing it.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.916
You would be so
popular if you did.

04:42.950 --> 04:44.985
All right, get that
thing away from me.

04:45.018 --> 04:48.055
I'm not gonna eat
some animal's face.

04:48.088 --> 04:50.090
You don't eat the face.

04:50.123 --> 04:53.561
You mount it on the
wall as a tribute.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.029
OK, I've sketched
out their floor plan.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.466
I say we stick to the
original as best we can,

04:58.499 --> 05:01.301
because whatever
they're doing works.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.103
I'll tell you one thing
we're gonna do differently.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.508
We're gonna put a lock on
the bathroom and a door.

05:07.541 --> 05:08.542
DJ!

05:08.576 --> 05:11.445
Darlene, do you know
if he ate dinner?

05:11.479 --> 05:13.514
Oh, I don't know, I
think Molly probably took

05:13.547 --> 05:16.083
him out back and slopped him.

05:16.116 --> 05:17.518
Well, would you please
go up and get him?

05:17.551 --> 05:20.488
'Cause I want him to come down,
taste one of these sandwiches.

05:20.521 --> 05:24.525
Oh, did Molly say how much
I owe her for babysitting?

05:24.558 --> 05:26.994
You know, funniest thing,
she said she couldn't

05:27.027 --> 05:28.228
take money for helping us out.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.330
It wouldn't be neighborly.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.465
What a nice girl.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.906
DJ!

05:38.939 --> 05:40.408
Mom said that she want--

05:43.577 --> 05:45.078
Oh, I'm sorry, Deej.

05:45.112 --> 05:48.516
I didn't know you were asleep.

05:48.549 --> 05:52.352
Like I'm really gonna buy
that, you stupid little loser.

05:52.386 --> 05:53.654
What are you up to?

05:53.687 --> 05:55.088
Nothing.

05:55.122 --> 05:57.891
Yeah, well then what's this?

05:57.925 --> 05:59.359
I was looking at the stars.

05:59.393 --> 06:00.193
Hmm.

06:05.032 --> 06:07.701
Oh, well, would
you look at that?

06:07.735 --> 06:09.169
There's a constellation
in the shape

06:09.202 --> 06:10.404
of a naked next door neighbor.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.176
I wasn't watching her.

06:16.209 --> 06:17.678
You were peeping at Molly.

06:17.711 --> 06:21.114
She's your babysitter,
you little pervert.

06:21.148 --> 06:22.015
I didn't do it.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.216
I hate girls.

06:23.250 --> 06:25.586
You know what happens
the next time you do it?

06:25.619 --> 06:27.721
I'm telling Mom and Dad.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.256
And then you get
hauled off to jail

06:29.289 --> 06:32.025
where peepers like you get
their eyelids sewn shut

06:32.059 --> 06:35.563
so they can never peep again.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.598
All right, go downstairs.

06:37.631 --> 06:41.435
Mom wants you to try
a loose meat sandwich.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.036
It's punishment enough for now.

06:51.211 --> 06:52.312
I knew she stuffed.

07:02.690 --> 07:03.524
Well?

07:03.557 --> 07:04.558
Yeah, what do you think, Dan?

07:04.592 --> 07:07.194
Did we get the recipe or not?

07:07.227 --> 07:11.465
Fruity yet bovine, an
impudent little sandwich.

07:11.499 --> 07:12.365
Bingo.

07:12.399 --> 07:13.501
Yes!

07:13.534 --> 07:14.401
It's great.

07:14.434 --> 07:15.836
It's just kind of hard to eat.

07:15.869 --> 07:18.539
Well, see, therein
lies the beauty.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.140
You drops half of
it on your lap,

07:20.173 --> 07:23.511
and then you're forced
to buy another one.

07:23.544 --> 07:25.412
I'll take another one.

07:25.445 --> 07:27.347
Coming right up.

07:27.380 --> 07:28.582
[giggling]

07:29.116 --> 07:30.283
What?

07:30.317 --> 07:32.486
It's just so neat, you
know, being in the kitchen

07:32.520 --> 07:34.488
with my guy all hungry,
waiting for food.

07:37.357 --> 07:39.827
Yeah, it really
is neat, you know.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.595
And if you play
your cards right,

07:41.629 --> 07:45.132
you get to do it three times a
day every day until one of you

07:45.165 --> 07:45.966
dies.

07:50.771 --> 07:54.341
OK, now we've got the recipe,
and we've got the money.

07:54.374 --> 07:56.143
And Nancy's out
looking for the place,

07:56.176 --> 07:59.880
so that means that so far we
have the recipe and the money.

07:59.913 --> 08:05.018
So what we need now
is a real catchy name.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.721
How about Lanford
Custom Cycle.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.290
I know where you can
get a sign real cheap.

08:10.323 --> 08:14.261
No, something real catchy
like Sandwiches and Stuff.

08:14.294 --> 08:15.162
Lunch and Munch.

08:15.195 --> 08:16.564
Eat and Go.

08:16.597 --> 08:19.733
Beef and Barf.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.635
All right, let's
think about this then.

08:21.669 --> 08:29.109
Meat, beef, beefy,
bun, sandwich,

08:29.142 --> 08:30.678
sandwich bun, the Sandwich Bun.

08:30.711 --> 08:31.511
I don't have anything.

08:39.887 --> 08:42.089
What's the matter
with you, DJ?

08:42.122 --> 08:43.624
You guys are in
there doing all

08:43.657 --> 08:46.560
this stuff about the restaurant,
and I don't get to do anything.

08:46.594 --> 08:48.395
Oh, I'm sorry.

08:48.428 --> 08:50.330
You know, it's your
restaurant too.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.866
You can do whatever
you want to do.

08:52.900 --> 08:54.501
Cool, I get to name the place!

08:54.534 --> 08:57.137
Well, uh, DJ, it's--

08:57.170 --> 08:59.740
Mom says I get to
name the restaurant.

08:59.773 --> 09:04.011
Great, from the boy who
named his goldfish Fluffy.

09:04.044 --> 09:05.646
Hey, he couldn't
do any worse than us.

09:05.679 --> 09:06.513
Go ahead, Deej.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.015
Give it a shot.

09:08.048 --> 09:08.849
The Lunchbox.

09:14.655 --> 09:15.455
That's pretty good.

09:19.793 --> 09:20.694
Lunchbox it is.

09:20.728 --> 09:21.595
Way to go, Deej.

09:21.629 --> 09:22.562
Yeah.

09:22.596 --> 09:23.463
Lunchbox.

09:23.496 --> 09:24.798
Hi, guys, guess what?

09:24.832 --> 09:25.999
We found a place.
- All right!

09:26.033 --> 09:27.200
Great!

09:27.234 --> 09:29.469
Because we got a name,
and we cracked the recipe.

09:29.502 --> 09:30.604
Yeah, yeah, here,
taste it, Nance.

09:34.341 --> 09:36.109
No, no, wait, me first.

09:36.143 --> 09:37.611
This is Kerry
Thompson, the realtor

09:37.645 --> 09:39.312
who's been showing me around.
DAN: Hi, Kerry.

09:39.346 --> 09:40.347
Hi.

09:40.380 --> 09:42.716
- Tell them about the place.
- Oh, OK.

09:42.750 --> 09:44.885
You know the Pizza
Palace on route 42?

09:44.918 --> 09:47.587
Yeah, that's the place with
the mural of the Last Supper

09:47.621 --> 09:50.758
but everyone's eating pizza.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.292
Really, the place is OK.

09:52.325 --> 09:53.193
Tell them it's OK.

09:53.226 --> 09:54.294
It's OK.

09:54.327 --> 09:56.396
But we have a problem.

09:56.429 --> 09:57.330
Tell them we have a problem.

09:57.364 --> 09:59.266
We have a problem.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.568
I don't think guys
have enough money.

10:01.601 --> 10:02.535
What are you talking about?

10:02.569 --> 10:04.037
We have $30,000.

10:04.071 --> 10:05.839
Well, you know, I mean,
have your accountant crunch

10:05.873 --> 10:07.975
the numbers, but I
haven't heard of anyone

10:08.008 --> 10:09.609
opening up even
the smallest place

10:09.643 --> 10:12.312
for under $40,000, $45,000.

10:12.345 --> 10:17.117
Not even if we skimp on
the health codes and stuff?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.252
Now, I'm just being honest.

10:19.286 --> 10:20.453
Well, we're screwed.

10:20.487 --> 10:22.555
There's no way any bank's
gonna loan us a dime.

10:22.589 --> 10:23.891
But you didn't let me finish.

10:23.924 --> 10:25.025
There's a thing we can do.

10:25.058 --> 10:25.926
Tell them about the--

10:25.959 --> 10:27.294
Would you stop that?

10:27.327 --> 10:28.929
I was telling
Nancy that we might

10:28.962 --> 10:30.864
want to try the Small
Business Administration.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.100
Now, it's this government
office where people

10:33.133 --> 10:35.168
like you can go and
get startup loans

10:35.202 --> 10:37.104
to get your business going.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.339
They're never gonna
give us any money.

10:39.372 --> 10:40.240
Sure, they will.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.641
We have a legitimate idea.

10:41.675 --> 10:43.610
We'll just go in there
and tell them the truth.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.511
Sounds great.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.512
We'll go down tomorrow.

10:45.545 --> 10:46.613
Tomorrow?

10:46.646 --> 10:48.115
I can't come up with
the truth by tomorrow.

11:00.828 --> 11:02.662
Donald Bobeck.

11:02.696 --> 11:04.064
Donald, that's a friendly name.

11:04.097 --> 11:05.132
A lot of friendly Donalds--

11:05.165 --> 11:09.569
Donald Duck, Donald
Sutherland, Donald--

11:09.602 --> 11:10.738
that girl's boyfriend.

11:10.771 --> 11:11.638
He was so friendly.

11:11.671 --> 11:13.573
What was his last name?

11:13.606 --> 11:15.642
Could you shut up?

11:15.675 --> 11:17.811
What are you so nervous about?

11:17.845 --> 11:21.081
Hollinger.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.415
What?

11:22.449 --> 11:25.819
That girl's boyfriend's
last thing was Hollinger.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.555
Oh great, well, could you
just keep that under your hat

11:28.588 --> 11:29.389
until they ask.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.194
Look at this pamphlet here.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.963
It's got this whole
section on minorities.

11:35.996 --> 11:38.065
It says they give
special consideration

11:38.098 --> 11:40.400
to businesses run by women.

11:40.433 --> 11:41.601
That's it.

11:41.634 --> 11:43.403
That's our angle.
We're women.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.309
I say we go with it.

11:49.342 --> 11:52.112
Thank god we all brought
our ovaries with us.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.580
[laughs]

11:53.613 --> 11:55.115
Hi there.

11:55.148 --> 11:56.750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

11:56.784 --> 11:58.685
Oh, that's OK.

11:58.718 --> 12:03.857
We're all real patient,
being women and all.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.226
Mrs. Conner and--

12:06.259 --> 12:10.163
- Ms. Harris.
- Just Nancy.

12:13.666 --> 12:16.103
Now, why don't you tell
me about this business

12:16.136 --> 12:17.170
you want to start?

12:17.204 --> 12:21.074
Well, OK, well, it's
a restaurant, see.

12:21.108 --> 12:22.342
But more.

12:22.375 --> 12:23.576
A lot more.

12:23.610 --> 12:26.780
We're gonna serve
loose meat sandwiches.

12:26.814 --> 12:28.381
Loose meat?

12:28.415 --> 12:32.319
Yeah, well, it's kind of like
early on when McDonald's just

12:32.352 --> 12:34.054
started, you know, because
all things are based

12:34.087 --> 12:35.655
around this kind
of hamburger thing,

12:35.688 --> 12:36.924
only ours looks really weird.

12:36.957 --> 12:40.693
But then you could buy
chips and pie and stuff.

12:40.727 --> 12:41.795
And pop.

12:41.829 --> 12:42.629
In cans.

12:46.834 --> 12:49.336
Interesting.

12:49.369 --> 12:52.072
Have any of you had
previous experience

12:52.105 --> 12:53.406
in running a restaurant?
- Oh, yeah.

12:53.440 --> 12:54.307
Yeah.

12:54.341 --> 12:55.408
I have.

12:55.442 --> 13:00.013
I was, well, the best
waitress at Rod Bells.

13:00.047 --> 13:01.614
But, you know, I
should have been put up

13:01.648 --> 13:03.116
into management but
they kind of held

13:03.150 --> 13:06.253
me back because I'm a woman.

13:06.286 --> 13:08.521
And you, Ms. Harris?

13:08.555 --> 13:14.327
I have hold meet.

13:14.361 --> 13:19.099
I have eaten meat.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.805
Nancy?

13:25.839 --> 13:29.809
I'm gonna have to take
a pass on this one, Don.

13:29.843 --> 13:32.946
Which, of course, we all
know is a woman's prerogative.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.347
[laughs]

13:35.715 --> 13:39.019
Well, we do have special
provisions for minorities

13:39.052 --> 13:40.687
and the handicapped.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.056
I assume none of
you are handicap.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.258
I have three kids.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.294
[chuckles] I'm in therapy.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.398
Mhm.

13:51.431 --> 13:54.534
And what bank will
you be going through?

13:54.567 --> 13:56.937
Oh, we're not going
through a bank, Don!

13:56.970 --> 13:59.039
That's why we're here.

13:59.072 --> 13:59.940
No, no, no, no.

13:59.973 --> 14:01.774
I don't think you understand.

14:01.808 --> 14:05.712
You see, what we do here at
the SBA is guarantee the loan.

14:05.745 --> 14:08.748
You still have to get
the money from the bank.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.918
Oh, so why do you call
it the Small Business

14:10.951 --> 14:12.185
Administration for?

14:12.219 --> 14:14.254
Why don't you call it the
"get your own damn money"

14:14.287 --> 14:16.023
administration.

14:16.056 --> 14:18.058
Mrs. Conner,
don't get excited.

14:18.091 --> 14:20.160
Well, now, we came to
you to get some money.

14:20.193 --> 14:24.164
So, do you guys have
any money or not?

14:24.197 --> 14:28.135
Well, we almost never
give direct loans.

14:28.168 --> 14:30.337
The government
changed the rules.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.272
Now we make a deal
with the banks

14:32.305 --> 14:35.442
so that if your business
folds, the bank will

14:35.475 --> 14:37.077
get most of its money back.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.579
Well, that sucks.

14:39.612 --> 14:41.915
So you're in
business with banks.

14:41.949 --> 14:42.916
What-- what about us?

14:42.950 --> 14:44.384
You know, banks
have tons of money.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.385
We don't got any.

14:45.418 --> 14:46.819
JACKIE: No, don't
blow it, Roseanne.

14:46.853 --> 14:50.290
This guy can help us get a loan
if he wants to recommend us.

14:50.323 --> 14:52.425
Will you recommend us?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.494
Not likely.

14:54.527 --> 14:58.831
Based on our criteria,
we consider you [sighs]

14:58.865 --> 15:00.400
a bad risk.

15:00.433 --> 15:03.370
I'll tell you
what a bad risk is.

15:03.403 --> 15:04.837
That's you sitting
across this desk

15:04.871 --> 15:06.273
from me calling me a bad risk.

15:06.306 --> 15:08.976
JACKIE: Forget it, Roseanne.

15:09.009 --> 15:12.612
You know, the SBA to help
people like you don't know

15:12.645 --> 15:14.614
nothing about people like us.

15:14.647 --> 15:16.816
The trouble with people
who work for the government

15:16.849 --> 15:17.817
is y'all have jobs.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.228
[doorbell ringing]

15:28.261 --> 15:30.197
[knocking]

15:30.230 --> 15:31.364
Yes?

15:31.398 --> 15:32.865
I think you should
know I was in my room

15:32.899 --> 15:36.136
getting ready for bed, and I
saw your brother watching me.

15:36.169 --> 15:38.705
Again?

15:38.738 --> 15:39.872
Again?

15:39.906 --> 15:42.475
Yeah, I caught him
doing it about a week ago.

15:42.509 --> 15:44.244
And you didn't do anything?

15:44.277 --> 15:45.445
Yeah, I told him
he wouldn't get

15:45.478 --> 15:46.313
much money for the pictures.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.750
I told him to stop.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.585
Thanks a lot
for all your help.

15:52.619 --> 15:53.987
Look, what was
I supposed to do?

15:54.021 --> 15:56.123
You could have told me.

15:56.156 --> 15:57.024
Oh, I forgot.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.191
You're not from these parts.

15:58.225 --> 16:00.027
Well here in the
big city, when you

16:00.060 --> 16:01.361
change in front
of an open window,

16:01.394 --> 16:04.764
you're not just
amusing the sheep.

16:04.797 --> 16:07.100
Darlene, what do
you have against me?

16:07.134 --> 16:08.401
Nothing.

16:08.435 --> 16:10.370
I just feel that we're at
that point in our friendship

16:10.403 --> 16:14.074
where you should realize
that we don't have one.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.808
I mean, what did
I ever do to you?

16:15.842 --> 16:18.511
Is this because
David flirts with me?

16:18.545 --> 16:19.846
I think you have
that backwards.

16:19.879 --> 16:21.514
You're the one always
pulling the touchy feely

16:21.548 --> 16:22.982
routine every time he's around.

16:23.016 --> 16:24.751
Look, I was just
trying to be nice.

16:24.784 --> 16:28.955
Well, he's not used to
being treated that way, OK?

16:28.988 --> 16:30.923
All right, look, maybe
I came on a little strong

16:30.957 --> 16:32.225
the other day, but
I was mad at you.

16:32.259 --> 16:33.126
Just trust me.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.794
I'm not interested in David, OK?

16:34.827 --> 16:35.962
Yeah right.

16:35.995 --> 16:37.897
And I'm sure David
doesn't like me.

16:37.930 --> 16:38.798
I know that.

16:38.831 --> 16:39.999
I didn't say he liked you.

16:40.033 --> 16:41.634
I said, cut the boy toy crap.

16:41.668 --> 16:42.802
OK.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.104
I know he doesn't like you!

16:44.137 --> 16:45.004
Fine!

16:45.038 --> 16:45.838
Fine!

16:48.108 --> 16:52.745
So anyway, are you gonna do
something about your brother?

16:52.779 --> 16:54.881
- Yeah, I'll take care of it.
- Well, I hope so.

16:54.914 --> 16:58.718
Because he could grow up to be
a really disturbed individual.

16:58.751 --> 17:00.587
You don't understand
here, Molly.

17:00.620 --> 17:02.189
This is the most normal
thing he's ever done.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.666
Hey, at least you tried.

17:13.700 --> 17:14.601
Yeah.

17:14.634 --> 17:17.470
I guess now I'm
back to trucking.

17:17.504 --> 17:19.272
Yeah, and I guess
I'm back to looking

17:19.306 --> 17:22.075
for some low paying crap job.

17:22.109 --> 17:22.975
Don't worry, honey.

17:23.009 --> 17:25.912
You'll find one.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.581
Dammit, Dan, I really
wanted this, you know?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.184
I wanted it really, really bad.

17:31.218 --> 17:32.652
I know, Rosie.

17:32.685 --> 17:34.487
It's not fair!

17:34.521 --> 17:36.055
I know, Jackie.

17:36.089 --> 17:40.093
How come our lives always has
to be the one that suck, huh?

17:40.127 --> 17:41.361
I don't know, Rosie.

17:41.394 --> 17:43.930
How come we never get one
little thing that we want?

17:43.963 --> 17:44.764
I don't know, Jackie.

17:47.500 --> 17:49.636
This is all your
fault, Jackie.

17:49.669 --> 17:50.970
My fault?

17:51.003 --> 17:53.039
Yeah, you're the one that
dragged that damn ray of hope

17:53.072 --> 17:54.674
into this house.

17:54.707 --> 17:56.609
I just can't believe
it's gonna end like this.

17:56.643 --> 17:58.811
There's got to be somebody
to loan us the money.

17:58.845 --> 17:59.846
How about Crystal and Ed?

17:59.879 --> 18:00.813
Nah.

18:00.847 --> 18:02.249
They got three kids
and a mortgage.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.150
Chuck and Anne-Marie.

18:03.183 --> 18:04.484
He's still looking for work.

18:04.517 --> 18:05.852
Gill and Penny?

18:05.885 --> 18:09.122
No, they're barely getting
by like everybody else we know.

18:09.156 --> 18:11.891
We've got to get a
better class of friends.

18:11.924 --> 18:14.461
[sighs] There's got
to be somebody who can

18:14.494 --> 18:21.834
give us $10,000 like Mom did.

18:21.868 --> 18:23.536
Well, it's a
awful lot of money.

18:23.570 --> 18:27.674
What happened to the $10,000
I gave you last week?

18:27.707 --> 18:32.212
Aw, cripes, Mom, we blew
that on candy and records.

18:32.245 --> 18:34.647
Roseanne, I told you,
it was a big mistake.

18:34.681 --> 18:35.548
Now, hold on.

18:35.582 --> 18:36.716
I didn't say no.

18:36.749 --> 18:39.319
Just give me a few minutes.

18:39.352 --> 18:42.689
Well, now, you've got to
use your imagination, Ma.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.757
You know, you've got to like
picture it full of people.

18:44.791 --> 18:47.093
Yeah, it's gonna look way
different full of people,

18:47.126 --> 18:50.597
Mom. it's not gonna
look so empty.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.166
Yes, Jackie, I suppose
it is the kind of place

18:53.200 --> 18:56.403
your trucker friends
would frequent.

18:56.436 --> 19:00.273
Would you like to
see the oven, Mom?

19:00.307 --> 19:03.910
I think I smell mice.

19:03.943 --> 19:04.877
What are we doing?

19:04.911 --> 19:05.878
This is our dream.

19:05.912 --> 19:09.349
We can't have a
dream with Mom in it!

19:09.382 --> 19:12.118
Well, don't think about
it as asking for her help.

19:12.151 --> 19:16.656
Think of it as
draining our nest egg.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.725
BEVERLY: This water is yellow!

19:18.758 --> 19:21.361
Oh god, oh god, oh god!

19:21.394 --> 19:24.964
I told you we shouldn't
have brought her here!

19:24.997 --> 19:27.534
Listen, trust me, this
is the perfect place

19:27.567 --> 19:29.469
to hit her up for money.

19:29.502 --> 19:34.507
And if she says no, it's the
perfect place to dump the body.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.543
Well, I've decided.

19:36.576 --> 19:38.478
I'm not going to
lend you the money.

19:38.511 --> 19:40.880
Big fat waste of time!

19:40.913 --> 19:45.685
However, what I will
do is put up the $10,000

19:45.718 --> 19:47.654
and become your fourth partner.

19:50.390 --> 19:53.025
But I want you to know,
I'm not doing this for you.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.427
I'm doing it for me.

19:54.461 --> 19:58.965
[laughs] I never had a chance
to do anything like this before.

19:58.998 --> 20:00.833
So, do we have a deal?

20:05.104 --> 20:06.939
Deal.

20:06.973 --> 20:10.643
This is where the thunder
claps and the sky turns black.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.178
I'll write you
a check tomorrow.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.647
You know what would look
great on these walls?

20:14.681 --> 20:16.215
Some paintings I've been doing.

20:16.249 --> 20:17.617
Painting, I've been painting!

20:24.524 --> 20:27.860
Listen, now--
now, listen, listen.

20:27.894 --> 20:30.763
Just think of it like this, OK?

20:30.797 --> 20:34.967
From now on, you'll be able
to write off your therapy

20:35.001 --> 20:36.369
as a business expense.

20:39.806 --> 20:43.142
[theme music]

20:51.584 --> 20:52.552
[doorbell ringing]

20:52.585 --> 20:54.954
[knocking]

20:57.089 --> 20:59.726
Your little brother
is doing it again.

20:59.759 --> 21:02.128
I told you I'd take
care of it, and I did.

21:02.161 --> 21:03.296
DJ!

21:03.330 --> 21:04.864
What are you calling
him down here for?

21:04.897 --> 21:05.965
He'll never admit it.

21:05.998 --> 21:07.066
Oh, he won't have to.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.135
I put shoe polish on
the eye of his telescope

21:09.168 --> 21:11.070
so he'll be branded for
the deviant that he is.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.442
What do you want?

21:15.475 --> 21:17.043
Brilliant plan.

21:17.076 --> 21:18.911
It should've worked.

21:18.945 --> 21:19.746
Hey.

21:34.694 --> 21:35.995
What?
