This is rustic.
Some backyard you got here.

00:21.316 --> 00:25.947
- Yeah, I like the quiet.
- Ugh, I fucking hate it.

00:26.866 --> 00:28.980
What, too many voices in your head?

00:31.283 --> 00:33.197
You have no idea.

00:34.366 --> 00:36.613
You should talk to someone about that.

00:36.732 --> 00:42.030
Well, why the hell do you
think I gave you a ride?

00:42.116 --> 00:44.980

00:45.066 --> 00:47.897
I'm honest. You're silent.

We both got our things.

00:51.399 --> 00:55.530
<i>So... what's your real damage?</i>

00:55.615 --> 01:00.980
I mean, you're obviously
punishing yourself for something.

01:01.066 --> 01:04.613
<i>Hey, we've all got shit we
wish we hadn't done, right?</i>

01:04.732 --> 01:06.897
And what shit do you
wish you hadn't done?

01:07.032 --> 01:10.864
Oh, we definitely haven't drank
enough for all that. [chuckles]

01:10.949 --> 01:13.613
So is this the part where you tell me

01:13.732 --> 01:17.447
to just forgive myself and move on?

01:17.565 --> 01:19.864
I don't know what you did.

01:19.949 --> 01:22.613
Maybe it's not forgivable.
[sighs]

01:24.066 --> 01:26.563
Did you forgive yourself?

01:27.732 --> 01:29.397
No.

01:29.532 --> 01:32.647
But I don't punish myself either.

01:32.732 --> 01:37.688

that to me one way or another anyway.

What do you want?

01:59.116 --> 02:02.864
I'm just trying to figure out if I'm
gonna keep running into you on this.

02:02.949 --> 02:05.697
And we both know I can't stop
you from poking around, but

02:05.782 --> 02:11.197
it would make my life easier if
you could just keep me in the loop.

- Fucking her was?

03:18.649 --> 03:21.430

03:26.615 --> 03:29.647
Well, get the fuck on with it.

You find whoever did this to her.

03:49.398 --> 03:50.697
FBI has it covered.

Employed is fine and good, but
you're talking about the cartels now.

I don't want to be compensated.

10:48.517 --> 10:50.014

Mr. Watts,

you make this delivery on time,

I'm sure you and I will come
to an agreement about your piece.

Why ain't you just killed me yet?

12:39.183 --> 12:41.215
I could do that.

12:42.467 --> 12:47.265
I could.
But honestly,

12:47.350 --> 12:51.014

- I will.

popcorn and saltwater taffy.

And we would sit on the same bench

18:59.217 --> 19:01.797
and he would tell me
stories about my mother.

19:04.300 --> 19:07.714

and put our feet in the surf.

19:10.799 --> 19:12.181

41:06.558 --> 41:08.673
I just want to say
a few things real quick.

41:08.808 --> 41:11.173
I gotta thank you all
for this celebration.

41:11.259 --> 41:12.673
It's great to see all of you.

41:12.808 --> 41:14.556
<i>[cheering]
[music stops]</i>

41:14.675 --> 41:17.839
Now, I look around and I see, man,

41:17.925 --> 41:21.806
a lot of changes since I went in.
A lot of changes.

41:21.892 --> 41:24.673
But after eight years in a cage,

41:24.808 --> 41:26.756
there's one thing that
hasn't changed at all.

41:26.841 --> 41:29.339
That's my commitment to all of you.

41:29.424 --> 41:30.589
[cheering]

41:30.675 --> 41:32.973
Like it or not, you
degenerates are my family.

41:33.058 --> 41:35.589
<i>[laughter]
Family sticks together.</i>

41:35.675 --> 41:39.339
<i>[cheers]
No matter what.</i>

41:39.424 --> 41:43.923
And on a personal note,
I've done my time.

41:45.508 --> 41:47.890
<i>Paid my dues.</i>

41:48.008 --> 41:53.006
And I'm tired of living in the gutter
in the name of the cause.

41:53.142 --> 41:55.090
<i>We sacrifice a lot for our beliefs.</i>

41:55.175 --> 41:59.257
But we's also allowed to enjoy
some of the spoils of war.

41:59.341 --> 42:02.056
[cheers]

42:02.175 --> 42:04.639
So I have laid plans.

42:05.808 --> 42:09.639
Plans that will put some of those spoils
into our own pockets.

42:09.725 --> 42:11.472
[cheers]

42:11.558 --> 42:14.556
And with that money
comes security.

42:14.675 --> 42:17.723
And with that, power.

42:17.841 --> 42:21.723
Tonight we drink.
[cheers]

42:21.841 --> 42:25.339
Tonight we fuck.
[cheers]

42:25.474 --> 42:30.256
And tomorrow,
the new Aryan revolution begins.

42:30.341 --> 42:32.723
<i>[cheering]
[music resumes]</i>

42:52.675 --> 42:57.140
- What the fuck was that?
- That was a new beginning, Calvin.

42:57.225 --> 42:59.553
Money? That's fucking pitch.

42:59.554 --> 43:01.781
Money? Since when has
the Brotherhood been about money?

43:01.838 --> 43:04.299
Don't be a fuck up, Calvin.
I take care of my own ideas

43:04.334 --> 43:06.731
don't pay the rent.
We can't all put on ties, suck dick

43:06.766 --> 43:09.626
- for some shit asking glamour.
- You're selling out the Brotherhood,

43:09.708 --> 43:13.121
everything we worked for,
look, you went to fucking jail for!

43:13.156 --> 43:14.768
I went to jail for my brothers,
for my family,

43:14.854 --> 43:16.552
for you, you ungrateful shit.

43:16.637 --> 43:19.385
And I come out and I see you
shitting all over the deals I made,

43:19.470 --> 43:22.367
looking at me
like I'm in your fucking way?

43:22.644 --> 43:25.308
Now, Maggie,
she married the wrong brother.

43:25.444 --> 43:28.935
Kurt might be confused,
but at least he got balls.

43:32.644 --> 43:34.725
Okay.

43:35.610 --> 43:39.775
- Okay.
- Let's fucking party!

Brock, leave me alone.
That's Randall Watts, the top dog.

44:13.694 --> 44:16.608
He just got out of jail.
One shot in his head and this is over.

44:16.694 --> 44:18.608
One shot and you're gonna have
the entire Brotherhood up here.

44:18.694 --> 44:20.859
Get up.
God damn it, Bunker. Be smart.

44:20.977 --> 44:22.775
<i>We've gotta be smarter than them.</i>

44:22.861 --> 44:25.475
We cannot beat them at their game.
We gotta beat them at ours.

44:25.610 --> 44:28.859
You're in uniform using one of our vehicles.
What the hell are you thinking?

44:28.977 --> 44:31.191
- I'm sorry.
- No, fuck sorry!

44:31.310 --> 44:34.558
This town's going off the rails.
We got a serial killer on the prowl,

44:34.644 --> 44:36.059
we got a mayor who's a gangster,

44:36.143 --> 44:38.275
and you want to start a war
with the neo-Nazis.

44:38.360 --> 44:39.775
Look at me.

44:39.861 --> 44:43.058
I don't have much in my life
that I care about anymore, Bunker.

44:43.143 --> 44:46.141
Just Banshee. That's it.

44:46.277 --> 44:49.141
And I'll be damned if I'm gonna
give up this town without a fight.

44:49.227 --> 44:51.225
Now you gotta decide right now

44:51.310 --> 44:53.692
whether you want to fight
with me the right way

44:53.811 --> 44:56.525
or you're just gonna be
another headache I gotta handle.

45:01.944 --> 45:03.975
Okay.

45:04.060 --> 45:07.655
- Okay?
- Okay.

45:10.811 --> 45:12.859
Let's get the hell out of here.

45:20.944 --> 45:26.535
That was a... [clears throat]
good speech.

45:33.644 --> 45:35.392
Ugh.

45:36.977 --> 45:40.358
Damn.
I took a couple shots back there.

45:40.477 --> 45:42.809
But you gave some, too.

45:46.694 --> 45:50.975
Hey, don't worry.
I already checked under the bed.

45:51.110 --> 45:53.892
You should get some rest.

45:53.977 --> 45:56.809
I should.
[sighs]

45:56.894 --> 45:59.392
But I can't drink all
this scotch by myself.

45:59.477 --> 46:01.525
Yeah, I think we both
know that's not true.

46:01.644 --> 46:04.058
Try and tell me you don't need a drink

46:04.143 --> 46:08.075
after that madness we
just witnessed back there.

46:09.976 --> 46:12.809
Yeah, you have a point.
[chuckles]

46:12.894 --> 46:14.859

So, we gonna track down that surgeon?

46:30.694 --> 46:32.974
I'm not a cop anymore.

46:33.110 --> 46:37.308
Even when I was,
I wasn't much of a team player.

46:37.394 --> 46:38.892
<i>Yeah, me neither.</i>

46:38.976 --> 46:41.892
But we're both out there
looking for the same guy.

46:41.976 --> 46:44.809
Might as well have each other's backs.

46:45.861 --> 46:48.475
I know you can go it alone.

46:48.610 --> 46:51.308
Me, too. That's why they sent me.

46:51.444 --> 46:57.279
But this guy is...
a different kind of bad news.

46:58.110 --> 47:02.275
And this is your town.
You know the lay of the land.

47:04.143 --> 47:06.725
And I could really use the backup.

47:21.694 --> 47:23.358
Okay.

47:36.477 --> 47:38.941
Maggie.

47:39.026 --> 47:42.058
Oh, I've been trying to reach you.
They let my dad out.

47:42.143 --> 47:44.225
I know.
He came to see me earlier.

47:44.310 --> 47:46.558
You've gotta do something, okay?
You can't wait any longer.

47:46.644 --> 47:49.108
I'm working on it, Maggie,
but this is a lot bigger

47:49.193 --> 47:53.359
/ than just your father and Calvin.
- You're talking about the drugs.

47:53.360 --> 47:56.386
How do you know about that?

47:59.277 --> 48:02.167
- I found these on Calvin's desk.
- Jesus Christ, Maggie,

48:02.168 --> 48:05.119
- if he caught you...
- I'm just trying to give you

48:05.193 --> 48:07.392
what you need, okay? This is some
kind of a production schedule.

48:07.477 --> 48:10.141
There's some big delivery
coming up, I think.

48:10.277 --> 48:14.858
- This was on Calvin's desk?
- Yeah, why?

48:14.976 --> 48:18.358
These are very large quantities.

48:18.477 --> 48:25.308
This isn't just... local drug dealing.
This is...

But I need you to go home and
pretend like everything's okay.

48:43.394 --> 48:46.775
Kurt, I-I-I can't do
this much longer, okay?

48:46.860 --> 48:51.941
- I'm scared all the time.
- I know. I will get you out of there.
