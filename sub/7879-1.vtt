00:04.212 --> 00:05.712
Well, hello there.

00:05.780 --> 00:08.248
My name... it's not important,

00:08.299 --> 00:11.001
but what is, is the next half hour.

00:11.085 --> 00:12.502
You're going to see a cautionary tale

00:12.587 --> 00:16.340
that may greatly influence
your next hot tub purchase.

00:16.724 --> 00:18.226
Here we go.

00:23.514 --> 00:25.332
Wait, Stan.

00:25.400 --> 00:29.152
Maybe we could do a little,
you know, morning grind.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.740
Wish I had time, but you know
how busy my days are.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.540
Oh, you're being ridiculous.

00:33.608 --> 00:35.077
It takes, like, two minutes.

00:35.343 --> 00:37.537
Let me break down my day
for you-- I'm up at 7:00.

00:37.703 --> 00:39.998
<i>From 7:00 to 7:08, I brush,</i>
<i>shave, shower...</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:42.084
From 7:08 to 7:09,

00:42.250 --> 00:43.627
<i>I frantically eat Grape-Nuts.</i>

00:43.793 --> 00:45.569
Then I have until 7:45
to take out the trash,

00:46.087 --> 00:48.006
<i>mow the lawn,</i>
<i>and feed Klaus his omelet.</i>

00:48.172 --> 00:49.132
7:45 to 9:00,

00:49.298 --> 00:50.342
<i>drive Steve to school</i>

00:50.508 --> 00:51.635
<i>and pick up</i> <i>Roger's dry cleaning.</i>

00:51.801 --> 00:52.636
9:00 to 9:10,

00:52.802 --> 00:53.428
<i>park, coffee, desk.</i>

00:53.594 --> 00:55.138
<i>9:11 to 9:12,</i>

00:55.304 --> 00:56.880
<i>think about 9/11.</i>

00:56.948 --> 00:57.849
<i>I get it, Stan,</i>

00:58.015 --> 00:59.232
you're busy.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.968
Great, the time we've spent
talking about this

01:01.019 --> 01:02.168
has put me off schedule.

01:02.220 --> 01:03.814
Now I'll have to shave in the car.

01:08.150 --> 01:09.986
Steve, out!

01:11.821 --> 01:12.796
Aw, damn it!

01:12.864 --> 01:14.449
Asian!

01:14.699 --> 01:16.867
This is not my fault,
Stan, I was texting.

01:20.655 --> 01:22.624
Dad, I'm going to be late.

01:22.790 --> 01:24.324
Look, I-I-I don't have time for this.

01:24.392 --> 01:26.878
I have to get this kid to
soccer practice and then-- aah!

01:27.044 --> 01:28.462
Back problems, huh?

01:28.529 --> 01:30.882

01:39.057 --> 01:42.509
Well, I guess it's up to me
to get to soccer practice.

01:57.191 --> 01:58.224
What are we doing here?

01:58.276 --> 01:59.943
You need to loosen up that back,

02:00.011 --> 02:02.813
and nothing can get you
looser than a hot 'cuzzi.

02:02.880 --> 02:05.917
Look at me, I'm all loosey-goosey.

02:08.786 --> 02:10.354
It's all thanks to my hot tub.

02:10.420 --> 02:13.256
Margaritte, set this man up
with some jets.

02:13.324 --> 02:15.218
Hi, I'm Margaritte.

02:15.543 --> 02:17.511
Look, I'm sorry, I'm not
really a hot tub guy.

02:17.578 --> 02:18.513
I have a family.

02:18.679 --> 02:20.547
Okay, first of all,
you need to let go

02:20.615 --> 02:22.783
of any preconceived notions
you have about tubs.

02:22.850 --> 02:24.451
We have a wide selection of tubs

02:24.519 --> 02:26.453
and can find the tub
that is right for you.

02:26.521 --> 02:27.621
Look at this tub.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.656
This is a family tub, DVD player...

02:29.724 --> 02:31.026
put <i>The Princess and the Frog</i>
on there.

02:31.388 --> 02:32.944
It's a good movie, man.

02:33.161 --> 02:34.461
A lot of people ain't see it

02:34.529 --> 02:36.229
because they weren't ready
to accept a black princess,

02:36.297 --> 02:37.714
and that's what
I'm talking about, man,

02:37.782 --> 02:39.182
being open-minded.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.085
Just be free and see
what's around you.

02:42.153 --> 02:44.039
Find your tub.

♪ Well... ♪

02:55.199 --> 02:57.167

02:59.270 --> 03:01.973
a single man's tub designed
for a party lifestyle.

03:02.139 --> 03:05.358
It's like it called to me.

03:05.426 --> 03:07.994
Come on, Stan,
that is a used hot tub.

03:08.062 --> 03:09.930
That's gross, man.

03:09.997 --> 03:12.199
This is an anything-goes tub.

03:12.266 --> 03:14.486

Oh, Stan, I can't believe
we have a hot tub!

03:26.956 --> 03:29.950

before I pick up the kids.

07:20.372 --> 07:23.608
I sat outside school like
an idiot for over four hours!

07:23.676 --> 07:25.560
Then I walked home
like a, like an animal!

07:25.628 --> 07:26.961
Do you even care?

07:27.029 --> 07:29.699
I mean, did you even pick
Roger up from soccer practice?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.242
Stan, the hot tub is great,

07:41.310 --> 07:43.111
but you need to take Steve to school.

07:43.178 --> 07:45.179
But I'm only halfway through my soak.

07:45.247 --> 07:47.332
Gee, Dad, I'd love to
get in the hot tub, too,

07:47.399 --> 07:48.733
but I can't because I'm pretty sure

07:48.801 --> 07:51.096
my parents (bleep) in it last night.

07:55.824 --> 07:58.592
Well, damn, man, you all tight again.

07:58.644 --> 08:00.295
Yeah, I don't want to go to work.

08:00.362 --> 08:02.947
Hey, we should have a party.

08:03.032 --> 08:04.065
No can do.

08:04.116 --> 08:06.200
Okay, okay, okay, I hear you.

08:06.268 --> 08:08.119
But what if we did?

08:14.451 --> 08:16.661
Ow, baby, yeah!

08:16.745 --> 08:19.447
Man, I got to tell you, I
was wrong about this tub.

08:19.498 --> 08:21.466
It is so deluxe.

08:21.550 --> 08:24.552
It seems more advanced
than a modern-day tub,

08:24.619 --> 08:27.632
which is strange.

08:28.957 --> 08:30.802
Great party, Stan.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.144
I brought you some of this Spa Down.

08:33.227 --> 08:35.229
Now, you'll need it
after a party like this.

08:35.297 --> 08:38.265
All the... body oils...
you know what I mean...

08:38.333 --> 08:39.650
it affects the chemistry
of the water,

08:39.735 --> 08:41.352
so when the tub gets out of control,

08:41.437 --> 08:44.439
just use some of this Spa Down
to calm it down.

08:44.490 --> 08:45.483
What the hell?!

08:45.649 --> 08:48.876
Get out, all of you!

08:50.070 --> 08:51.246
Who were those women, Papa?

08:51.313 --> 08:53.825
Steve, go inside.

08:53.991 --> 08:56.150
Stan, ever since you
got this hot tub,

08:56.218 --> 08:57.919
you've been acting different.

08:57.987 --> 09:00.054
You are taking a break from this tub.

09:00.122 --> 09:01.889
Fine.

09:25.689 --> 09:27.984
Come on, babe, you still mad?

09:28.150 --> 09:29.150
Yes.

09:29.218 --> 09:31.419
Stan, we can't just
do whatever we want.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.854
We're parents.

09:32.921 --> 09:35.123
You don't think that every
single day of my life

09:35.190 --> 09:36.524
I want to do coke?

09:36.592 --> 09:39.329
But I can't because
I have PTA tomorrow.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.145
And you need to clean the garage,

09:41.230 --> 09:43.147
Do the bills, do the gutters.

09:43.232 --> 09:44.876
The car needs an oil change,

09:45.150 --> 09:47.869
You have to look at that
busted sprinkler head,

09:47.936 --> 09:49.047
you need to help Steve
with his homework,

09:49.213 --> 09:51.906
move that wood pile out back.

09:51.957 --> 09:52.884
Stan!

09:53.050 --> 09:54.075
Are you listening to me?

09:54.143 --> 09:55.293
Yeah, yeah, of course,

09:55.377 --> 09:56.811
I'll, I'll do all of that
in the morning.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.913
