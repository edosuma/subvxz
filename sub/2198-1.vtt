02:06.760 --> 02:07.886
Huh?

02:07.960 --> 02:09.928
(WHISPERING) Oh, my God.
It means cover me, go left.

02:10.000 --> 02:11.889
Read the manual, why don't you?

02:13.880 --> 02:15.723
Wait for my three count.

02:16.040 --> 02:17.565
One... two...

02:18.400 --> 02:19.811

02:21.560 --> 02:24.882
Hands on top of your head!
On your head!

02:26.560 --> 02:27.891
Surprise.

02:28.320 --> 02:30.766
We've checked everywhere.
There's nothing.

02:31.240 --> 02:33.766
Place is clean, Ashburn.
Looks like your...

02:34.000 --> 02:36.844
...theory has a few holes in it.
Let's roll, boys.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.288
So you think it's clean, huh?
Oh, here we go.

02:39.440 --> 02:41.363
That's what they said last year

02:41.440 --> 02:43.602
right before I arrested
the Red Falls Killer.

02:43.920 --> 02:46.366
What are those?
Barbecued spare ribs?

02:46.640 --> 02:48.001
Is that what that is?
(DOG PANTING)

02:48.280 --> 02:50.726
I don't know,
maybe I'm wrong. Or...

02:53.760 --> 02:55.091
...maybe I'm not.

02:55.320 --> 02:57.766
Yeah. Airtight.
Dipped in wax.

02:58.080 --> 02:59.411
I respect that.

02:59.560 --> 03:02.325
I especially like the meat
to distract the dog.

03:02.760 --> 03:06.287
And while that may have fooled the
loudest breather in the world...

03:06.560 --> 03:08.085
...it did not fool me.

03:08.240 --> 03:10.402
And unfortunately it's not
what I'm looking for.

03:10.600 --> 03:13.444
So let's just cut to the chase.
Are there guns in the house?

03:13.640 --> 03:15.130
I don't know anything
about any guns.

03:15.760 --> 03:16.966
ASHBURN: Interesting.

03:17.600 --> 03:19.284
Maybe I'm wrong... you know?

03:19.440 --> 03:20.441
Wait for it.

03:20.600 --> 03:22.364
Maybe these guys
are right for a change.

03:22.440 --> 03:24.647
(CHUCKLES) Stranger things
have happened, right?

03:24.800 --> 03:26.848
That's a trap.
ASHBURN: Meteors, comets...

03:27.400 --> 03:29.607
Somebody married Pete and he
can't even count to three.

03:29.800 --> 03:30.801
See? Right there.

03:31.080 --> 03:32.286
ASHBURN: Oh, so frustrating.

03:32.960 --> 03:36.009
You know, they loved these houses
during the prohibition era.

03:36.600 --> 03:38.360
You guys know what
prohibition is, don't you?

03:38.640 --> 03:40.642
Yeah, selling your ass
for money?

03:41.080 --> 03:43.162
Really?

03:43.480 --> 03:44.811
No, it was alcohol.

03:44.960 --> 03:47.167
People loved to drink it, even
though they weren't supposed to.

03:47.320 --> 03:48.765
And these houses
had all these nooks

03:48.880 --> 03:50.800
and crannies where they could hide it.
(CLICKING)

03:50.920 --> 03:52.285
Like this one.

03:53.600 --> 03:56.649
Is there something behind me? (MOCK
WHISPERING) There is, isn't there?

03:57.320 --> 03:58.321
Fuck.

03:59.160 --> 04:00.650
Now you can roll.

Wow, that's pretty impressive, huh?

04:44.000 --> 04:45.684
Do you see that?
Look at that.

04:46.000 --> 04:47.889
DOCTOR: <i>Make an incision
right through there.</i>

04:48.080 --> 04:49.480
ASHBURN: That's
pretty amazing, huh?

04:50.160 --> 04:51.525
Pretty amazing.

04:51.880 --> 04:53.041
WOMAN: Pumpkin!

04:53.360 --> 04:54.725
Here, kitty, kitty!

04:55.160 --> 04:57.049
Are you at
the neighbor's again?

04:57.240 --> 04:58.605
Pumpkin!

04:59.560 --> 05:00.891
Here, kitty, kitty!

05:01.440 --> 05:03.602
Go on home. I'll see you tomorrow.
(MEOWS)

05:04.000 --> 05:05.365
There you go.

05:08.560 --> 05:12.531
Pumpkin, I told you to stay
away from that weird lady.

you working late, huh?

05:53.280 --> 05:54.884
(CHUCKLING) What do you want?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.606
Oh, just letting you know that I
have been observing the agents.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.125
Overseeing what
they've been up to,

05:59.200 --> 06:00.929
you know...
keeping an eye on them.

06:01.080 --> 06:02.570
Yeah. Supervising.

06:02.920 --> 06:04.410
Supervising. Yes, sir.

06:04.600 --> 06:05.806
Look, Ashburn.

06:05.960 --> 06:07.928
I haven't made
any decisions yet.

06:08.240 --> 06:11.289
Oh, of course not.
Everyone deserves a shot.

06:11.800 --> 06:14.644
I don't know if you are the
right person for this position.

06:14.920 --> 06:17.241
I'm sorry, what?
I'm confused.

06:17.480 --> 06:18.527
Walk with me.

06:18.760 --> 06:22.924
I've closed more cases than any agent here.
Should I not have done that?

06:23.080 --> 06:26.607
You are a solid agent. There
are many other solid agents.

06:26.800 --> 06:29.644
None of them have closed
the Red Falls Killer case.

06:29.800 --> 06:32.770
Ashburn, it's no secret that none
of the other agents like you.

06:32.960 --> 06:33.961
What?

06:34.160 --> 06:35.571
I've gotten
countless complaints

06:35.640 --> 06:38.484
of arrogance and competitiveness.
..showmanship.

06:38.720 --> 06:40.165
Just give it a rest.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.085
All right. We've got
a situation in Boston.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.491
The Feds picked up chatter
on a guy moving in.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.091
Simon Larkin.

06:49.480 --> 06:53.280
We don't know what he looks like,
where he comes from, nothing.

06:53.480 --> 06:55.847
We believe this guy is
doing the legwork for him.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.321
Julian Vincent.
Nasty son of a bitch.

06:58.680 --> 07:00.330
Murder. Extortion.

07:00.640 --> 07:02.130
This is his M.O.

07:02.960 --> 07:04.803
The problem with
guys like that is...

07:04.960 --> 07:06.644
...everyone's
too scared to talk.

07:06.840 --> 07:08.968
Pack your bags.
I'm sending you to Boston.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.963
You know how to get
inside people's heads.

07:11.120 --> 07:13.009
You want to find Larkin,
get to Julian.

we can talk about the job.

07:46.560 --> 07:47.561
MAN: Champaz?

07:47.720 --> 07:48.881
Did your mom
give you that name?

Not exactly.

DISPATCHER: <i>Hey, Mullins. Captain
wants to know when you're coming in.</i>

07:55.040 --> 07:58.567
You know what? Tell him I'll be there
sharply at go-fuck-yourself o'clock.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.406
Okay? If there's no traffic.
Thank you.

08:02.040 --> 08:03.724
That seems kind of expensive.
Expensive?

08:03.920 --> 08:05.524
Can you break a hundred?

08:05.600 --> 08:07.204
GIRL: No, I'm not gonna
break a hundred.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.404
(MUMBLING) I don't think I have that.
Do you have a discount?

08:11.360 --> 08:13.203
What's going on here?

08:14.240 --> 08:16.686
Okay, I don't want any drugs.
All right? Oh!

08:18.320 --> 08:19.321
How you doing?

08:19.480 --> 08:21.767
Are you trying to get a
deal on my girl here?

08:21.920 --> 08:23.046
Are you her pimp?

08:23.200 --> 08:24.565
No, we're just friends.

08:24.720 --> 08:27.530
Well, I think this is just
between her and I, so...

08:27.760 --> 08:29.171
Am I invading your space here?

08:29.240 --> 08:30.287
MAN: Kind of.

08:30.440 --> 08:32.727
I don't want to do that. Let
me see if this'll help you.

08:33.400 --> 08:34.731

(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

It's a good thing I didn't
get the drugs from you.

08:42.880 --> 08:44.689
Yeah, can you imagine that?

08:44.760 --> 08:45.966
(LAUGHING)

08:46.240 --> 08:47.571
That would have been crazy.

08:47.640 --> 08:48.971
That would have been bad.

08:49.120 --> 08:50.963
That would have been bad!

08:51.040 --> 08:52.041
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

08:52.920 --> 08:54.001
Phew!

08:54.240 --> 08:56.561
You'd better wipe that brow.

08:57.960 --> 09:04.241
Listen, I gotta ask. Whatever... But
what was actually going on here?

09:04.320 --> 09:06.891
We were just...

09:07.640 --> 09:11.725
She looked kind of sad, so I thought I'd
help her out and give her a ride home.

09:11.800 --> 09:13.928
That's nice, like a good Samaritan.
Yeah.

09:14.000 --> 09:16.401
Are you depressed? Was he
giving you a ride home?

09:16.480 --> 09:18.562
Yeah, I was cheering you up.
Yeah, good for you.

09:18.640 --> 09:20.722
You know who else is pretty sad?
Frank over here.

09:20.800 --> 09:23.644
Right, Frank? You get sad 'cause
you shit and piss yourself?

09:23.720 --> 09:24.721
You having a sad day, Frank?

09:24.800 --> 09:26.211
Hey, maybe you can put him
in the back of your car.

09:26.280 --> 09:29.090
You want to shit and piss
all over this guy's car?

09:29.160 --> 09:30.446
Let's open up the...

09:31.160 --> 09:33.970
Frank, you wanna shit your pants and get in the...
Oh, Good, it's open.

09:34.040 --> 09:35.565
I can put Frank in there.

09:35.640 --> 09:38.211
He can shit and piss
himself until he's happy.

09:38.520 --> 09:39.851
I got some towels...
Does that sound good?

09:40.000 --> 09:41.361
Why don't you let me
see your I.D.?

09:41.400 --> 09:42.447
Oh, come on, please?

09:42.680 --> 09:44.330
Let me take the whole thing.

09:44.520 --> 09:46.010
I don't...
It's good, I got it.

09:46.480 --> 09:47.811
Oh, good.

09:48.040 --> 09:50.088
I got nervous that
maybe you didn't have

09:50.160 --> 09:52.162
a wife and a whole
bunch of kids, but...

09:52.360 --> 09:54.727
...luckily you do.
What's your wife's name?

09:54.960 --> 09:55.961
Bella.

09:56.120 --> 09:57.804
Oh, Bella. Good.

09:58.320 --> 10:01.802
Hey, can I borrow your phone for a minute?
My battery's out.

10:02.000 --> 10:03.411
Why do you want
to borrow my phone?

10:03.480 --> 10:04.845
Because I asked
you for your phone.

10:05.040 --> 10:07.327
Give me your fucking phone.
Shut your mouth.

10:07.880 --> 10:10.247

10:10.440 --> 10:12.408
Yeah, I'll give you one chance.

Yeah, who's this? Is this Bella?
(GASPS)

10:14.400 --> 10:15.401
No, no, no!

10:15.520 --> 10:17.090
Don't do that. Don't do that.
(GROANING)

10:18.120 --> 10:20.646
This is Officer Mullins.
I'm here with your husband.

10:20.880 --> 10:22.882
God! What are you, Spock?
(GROANING)

10:23.440 --> 10:25.966
No, he's not been in an
accident, unfortunately.

10:26.120 --> 10:28.122
I do have him here
with a known prostitute.

10:28.280 --> 10:30.806
She's lying!
Bella, she's lying!

10:31.120 --> 10:33.043
Oh, that's not
the first time, huh?

10:33.480 --> 10:36.802
Yeah, that's him. He's crying because
I'm breaking his fucking hand.

10:37.040 --> 10:38.565
Oh, she said do it harder.

10:38.720 --> 10:40.404
Ow! All right, Bella.
That's for Bella.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.167
You got to go with
your instincts, Bella.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.490
You're welcome.

10:46.600 --> 10:48.807
She's probably gonna
burn your shit today.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.445
You don't understand.

10:50.600 --> 10:51.647
She just had a baby.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.649
There's a lot going on down there.
I'm not gonna touch that!

10:53.840 --> 10:55.968
Why don't you take
your seatbelt off?

10:56.120 --> 10:57.121
Come on, please.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.965
You seem reasonable.
Take your fucking belt off.

11:00.120 --> 11:01.610
You look like you
got some compassion.

11:01.800 --> 11:03.962
I love the sound
of a guy that...

11:04.160 --> 11:06.925
...after his wife gives him
his fifth fucking child,

11:07.000 --> 11:08.968
complains about
her messy vagina.

11:09.160 --> 11:11.322
And then you don't want
to fucking touch her?

11:11.520 --> 11:13.090
I can unlock the door!

11:13.160 --> 11:15.367
Get out of the fucking car!

11:15.640 --> 11:16.801
Get out of the fucking car!

11:16.880 --> 11:18.166
MAN: Are you kidding me?

11:18.520 --> 11:20.363
Get up against the car.
What is your problem?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.286
You want to do that?

11:22.360 --> 11:23.600
It's hot! The car is hot!

11:23.760 --> 11:26.286
Good! I hope it burns
your fucking dick off.

11:29.680 --> 11:32.490
MULLINS: Hey, it's Rojas!
My favorite asshole.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.205
Look what I found.

11:34.480 --> 11:37.529
Did I take some of your business away?
That's a shame.

11:37.680 --> 11:40.441
I don't know what you're talking about.
I just stand on this corner...

11:40.480 --> 11:42.005
...and do my sodukas, okay?

11:42.160 --> 11:44.321
Oh, is that right? First of
all, it's sudoku, dumb-ass.

11:44.840 --> 11:47.491
And you want to tell me that
you're just here coincidentally?

11:47.680 --> 11:49.569
Right in the middle
of all the prostitutes?

11:49.720 --> 11:51.722
Lady, why are you
so obsessed with me?

11:51.880 --> 11:52.881
You should be ashamed,

11:53.000 --> 11:55.651
trying to break down a successful
black man. You racist?

11:55.800 --> 11:58.121
Don't play that race
bullshit card with me!

11:58.320 --> 12:00.721
Nine out of ten guys
I fuck are black guys!

12:00.880 --> 12:04.965
Lady, what you need to do is go down
the road, take a vacation, okay?

12:05.240 --> 12:08.562
And go get your groove back.
Lady, just relax. Chill. Okay?

12:09.400 --> 12:10.401
What is that?

12:14.360 --> 12:15.407
Take off.

12:16.240 --> 12:17.241
That's what I thought.

12:17.560 --> 12:19.289
MAN: I'm not
a part of this!

12:19.360 --> 12:21.044
MULLINS: Shut up! Shut up!

12:28.720 --> 12:29.926
MAN: Oh, my God!

12:30.160 --> 12:31.685
Oh, it's on. (LAUGHS)

12:31.840 --> 12:32.921
She's crazy!

12:34.200 --> 12:36.726
Come on, please let me out. I
get really carsick. (PLEADING)

12:36.920 --> 12:38.763
Oh, no, that's terrible!

12:43.080 --> 12:45.082
I got him now.
I got him!

12:45.280 --> 12:46.930
You are a meth head!

12:47.280 --> 12:48.566
Oh, my God!

12:48.760 --> 12:50.125
Hey, look who's here!

12:54.440 --> 12:55.521
(LAUGHING)

12:58.760 --> 13:00.125
Yeah, you better run!

13:00.280 --> 13:01.406
Oh, shit.

13:08.960 --> 13:10.644
I got him! I got him!

13:13.720 --> 13:16.121
You piece of shit, I said stop!

13:16.600 --> 13:18.090
I said stop!

13:18.440 --> 13:19.521
I said stop!

13:19.600 --> 13:20.806
You're crushing my balls!

13:20.960 --> 13:22.644
I hope they fucking rupture!

13:23.840 --> 13:26.844
Lady, get the fuck off me! What
the hell is wrong with you?

13:26.960 --> 13:28.405
(GROANING)

13:30.680 --> 13:31.727
(WHIMPERING)

13:31.800 --> 13:34.007
Bella, I'm sorry!

13:34.440 --> 13:36.442
Let me go! Hold still,
you piece of shit!

13:36.640 --> 13:39.325
My leg, lady! Let me go!

13:40.600 --> 13:41.965
What is wrong with you?

13:42.120 --> 13:45.169
I'll tell you what's the matter with me!
It's you, piece of shit!

13:45.840 --> 13:47.171
Son of a bitch!

13:47.440 --> 13:48.805
Stop moving!

13:48.960 --> 13:50.325
Leave me alone!

13:50.520 --> 13:52.568
Get off me! Get off me!

13:54.840 --> 13:55.966
Shit. Oh!

13:57.640 --> 13:58.801
MULLINS: Yeah.

13:59.280 --> 14:00.805
What the hell did
you throw at me?

14:01.000 --> 14:02.047
A watermelon.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.360
A watermelon?

14:03.680 --> 14:05.682
Aw, hell, no! See, I told
you you was a racist.

14:05.840 --> 14:07.880
I tried to hit you with my car.
What's that make me?

14:08.000 --> 14:10.526
Let's see what you got in...
Oh, look at this!

14:10.800 --> 14:12.450
Look at this.
Not even my birthday.

14:12.520 --> 14:14.170
Hey, you planted
that shit on me!

14:14.320 --> 14:15.810
Yeah, I planted it.
I'm innocent!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.760
Shut up before I feed you watermelon.
Get up!

14:26.040 --> 14:27.041
Levy?

14:27.240 --> 14:29.242
Federal Agent Sarah Ashburn
from the New York field office.

14:29.360 --> 14:30.327
Hi, how are you?

14:30.400 --> 14:32.767
I need all your files on all
known drug dealers of the area.

14:32.920 --> 14:34.729
Right. We heard
you were coming.

14:34.880 --> 14:36.370
Actually, I was expecting it.

14:36.720 --> 14:37.881
I'll show you to your desk.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.360
Not necessary.
I won't be here long.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.210
I can carry these.
Thank you.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.609
Whoa! Hey! Ashburn!

14:47.840 --> 14:48.887
Oh!
Oh, God!

14:49.840 --> 14:51.365
You okay?
What is it?

14:51.600 --> 14:54.285
Low-end dealer just brought
into the East Boston precinct.

14:54.440 --> 14:55.930
Name's Terrell Rojas.

14:57.720 --> 14:59.563
Oh. Oh, okay.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.722
Good. Thank you very much.
Good luck out there.

15:02.200 --> 15:04.680
It's not about luck, pal.
Not about luck.

15:05.160 --> 15:06.241
(BRAKES SQUEAL)

15:08.080 --> 15:09.081
Wow.

15:09.560 --> 15:11.449
That was almost cool.

15:12.240 --> 15:14.163
Almost. (CHUCKLES)

15:23.680 --> 15:25.682
Come on, come on.

15:25.960 --> 15:27.962
Ain't gonna fucking park today?

15:28.280 --> 15:30.760
All right.
Here we go. Finally.

15:35.680 --> 15:37.205
I'm moving in there!

15:37.360 --> 15:38.441
No, don't...

15:38.520 --> 15:41.205
Hey, hey!
No, get back in your car!

15:42.760 --> 15:43.886
Hey, asshole!

15:44.760 --> 15:46.125
Goddamn it!

15:49.120 --> 15:50.121
FBI.

15:50.440 --> 15:51.965
Hey, you need to sign in.

15:54.800 --> 15:56.131
Captain Woods?

15:58.160 --> 15:59.286
Captain Woods?

15:59.440 --> 16:01.169
Christ.
I'm sorry?

16:01.480 --> 16:03.130
Uh... How can I help you?

16:03.640 --> 16:05.130
Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.

16:05.280 --> 16:06.884
We got intel recently
that you brought in

16:06.960 --> 16:08.530
a dealer by the name
of Terrell Rojas.

16:08.680 --> 16:10.842
Yeah, but Detective Mullins
isn't back from lunch yet.

16:11.320 --> 16:12.560
I'm sure he won't mind.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.327
He's a she, and we're not
allowed to go near her collars.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.971
Let me tell you what I think.

16:18.240 --> 16:19.480
Every second
we're standing here

16:19.520 --> 16:20.885
is interfering with
the federal investigation.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.162
So if you'd be so kind
as to show Mr. Rojas

16:23.240 --> 16:25.004
to an interrogation room.
Thank you.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.045
Special Agent?

16:28.000 --> 16:29.331
This way.

16:30.640 --> 16:32.005
Special Agent.

16:35.840 --> 16:37.330
Special Agent.

16:51.440 --> 16:52.680
Shit.

16:55.280 --> 16:58.011
You are looking at
possession with intent...

16:58.360 --> 17:02.046
...which is a class D drug charge,
chapter 94C, section 32A.

17:02.240 --> 17:04.288
I had a joint and a few
little bags of coke.

17:04.359 --> 17:05.599
Since when is
that shit illegal?

17:05.760 --> 17:07.603
The answer to your
question is always.

17:07.880 --> 17:09.369
And with your priors...

17:09.520 --> 17:13.047
...you are looking at 25 years
and some pretty stiff fines.

17:13.359 --> 17:16.045
Who the hell cares about fines?
That's 25 years!

17:16.359 --> 17:19.522
Never mind. Let's see
what you make of these.

17:20.200 --> 17:21.724
What I make of them...

17:21.880 --> 17:25.281
...is that somebody doesn't want
somebody else selling on their turf.

17:25.880 --> 17:29.043
But you're still here... and you're alive.
Why is that?

17:29.200 --> 17:30.725
Who you working for?
Nobody.

17:30.880 --> 17:31.961
Who you working for?
Nobody.

17:32.040 --> 17:33.121
Who you working for?
Nobody!

17:33.200 --> 17:34.804
If I tell you,
that's my ass chopped up

17:34.880 --> 17:36.405
into a million
motherfucking pieces!

17:38.040 --> 17:39.485
Goddamn it.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.686
(SIGHING)

17:40.840 --> 17:42.205
Fucker.

17:43.680 --> 17:45.569
God. Puss!

17:46.040 --> 17:48.042
Motherfucker!

17:48.120 --> 17:51.044
Everybody's got to fucking
park in my spot. Goddamn it!

17:51.920 --> 17:54.082
Shit! Suit-wearing, god...
(HORN HONKS)

17:54.560 --> 17:56.244
Ow, fuck!

17:57.120 --> 17:58.485
(GASPING)

17:58.560 --> 18:01.928
I said I'm fucking parking there!
(HONKING)

18:02.240 --> 18:04.561
Steal my goddamn fucking space!

18:08.640 --> 18:11.041
(SIGHS) I don't
want you to do time.

18:11.720 --> 18:14.291
I don't want you to get chopped
up into little, tiny...

18:15.120 --> 18:16.963
...mother-F-ing pieces. Oh.

18:17.280 --> 18:20.602
I can protect you. I can.
But you've got to help me.

18:20.920 --> 18:21.921
I can help you.

18:22.280 --> 18:23.770
You'll help me?
Yeah.

18:23.920 --> 18:25.285
Where can I find Julian?

18:25.440 --> 18:29.411
I get my stuff from this bitch
named Tatiana on Newkirk Avenue.

18:29.560 --> 18:30.971
Can you describe her?

18:31.280 --> 18:32.930
She got brown eyes.

18:33.440 --> 18:36.603
She got some
big-ass breastses.

18:37.560 --> 18:39.085
Big breastses.
Okay.

18:39.440 --> 18:42.523
Can you maybe be a little
bit more specific?

18:46.200 --> 18:48.726
Her breastses is like this.

18:50.240 --> 18:51.605
Okay. Thank you.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.564
That's a shame.

19:04.880 --> 19:05.881
Don't.

19:06.240 --> 19:09.005
Oh! Ha-ha! Oh, yeah!
We're at a comedy party!

19:09.200 --> 19:11.726
Move the fuck out of my way.
Get a room.

19:12.080 --> 19:14.003
Tim, you still owe me $40.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.244
Yeah, tomorrow it's $60!
Fucking dickweed.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.164
Why is the cage empty?

19:19.400 --> 19:21.767
What did I tell you
about moving my prisoners?

19:21.920 --> 19:23.331
He's in interrogation.

19:23.880 --> 19:26.804
Why would he be in interrogation
when I'm standing right here?

19:27.200 --> 19:28.247
They came and got him.

19:28.320 --> 19:29.367
Who's "they"?

19:29.560 --> 19:31.562
It better be two of me.
Is it two of me?

19:31.720 --> 19:32.767
It was a lady.

19:32.840 --> 19:34.285
I'm a lady.
Did I come and get him?

19:34.480 --> 19:36.482
No, it was a different lady.
She was nice.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.882
I'm fucking nice.
Why was she nice to you?

19:39.040 --> 19:40.485
She made me give her the keys.

19:40.640 --> 19:42.722
I'm gonna make you
fucking bend over...

19:42.880 --> 19:44.962
...and I'm gonna reach up
your ass into your pocket

19:45.120 --> 19:46.485
and get the keys to your house.

19:46.640 --> 19:48.449
Then I'm gonna drive there...

19:48.600 --> 19:50.762
...come in your front door
and kill you in your sleep.

19:51.120 --> 19:53.407
I think I have a clear idea
of what we're looking for,

19:53.480 --> 19:54.720
and I appreciate your time.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.649
Wow, lady, you're on
a real fucking roll.

19:56.840 --> 19:57.887
Excuse me?

19:57.960 --> 19:59.246
No, I won't excuse you.

19:59.400 --> 20:01.971
I just spent the last 30 minutes
thinking of ways to kill you.

20:02.160 --> 20:04.083
I'm sorry, when did we meet?

20:04.240 --> 20:05.321
Is this your lawyer?

20:05.560 --> 20:08.086
Are you an insurance salesman?
Do you sell those shitty suits?

20:08.240 --> 20:10.766
I'm Special Agent Sarah Ashburn.
How can I help you?

20:10.960 --> 20:13.930
You can get all of that
and get the fuck out of here.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.081
This is my room

20:15.240 --> 20:17.322
Were you about to be
questioned by a detective?

20:17.520 --> 20:20.285
I am a detective
and that's my perp.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.728
Ah! I understand now.

20:24.040 --> 20:27.044
Detective, Mr. Rojas will
be continuing on with me.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.483
No.
It's a jurisdictional issue.

20:29.640 --> 20:30.766
Not gonna happen.

20:30.840 --> 20:32.410
Your efforts are duly noted.

20:32.480 --> 20:33.527
Oh, great.

20:33.600 --> 20:36.171
And if you're okay with
everything, could you just...

20:36.320 --> 20:38.402
...close the door on the way out?
I'll shut the door on you.

20:38.560 --> 20:40.130
Will you lay down and put
your head in the door?

20:40.200 --> 20:43.329
I'll slam it
about 157,000 times.

20:43.480 --> 20:44.925
Aw, shit, girl, you better run.

20:45.080 --> 20:46.923
Shut your mouth.
Run like you on fire.

20:47.080 --> 20:48.161
Be quiet.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.322
Get up and we'll
settle this outside.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.164
I won't be going outside.

20:52.320 --> 20:54.687
You're gonna get up
and come outside.

20:54.840 --> 20:55.921
No, ma'am.

20:56.080 --> 20:57.764
Fine. We'll do this inside.

20:58.080 --> 21:01.129
Can somebody remove this person
from the interrogation room?

21:01.320 --> 21:04.563
Mental illness is nothing to be ashamed of.
It runs in many families.

21:04.720 --> 21:05.767
I'm gonna hit you.

21:05.840 --> 21:07.046
You're not. Please don't.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.402
I'm gonna hit you and knock
all your little buttons.

21:09.560 --> 21:10.607
I'm gonna hit you there,
or here...

21:10.680 --> 21:11.806
Do not put your finger in...

21:11.960 --> 21:13.166
Stop touching my buttons!

21:13.240 --> 21:14.321
Stop wearing buttons.

21:14.480 --> 21:16.642
Don't move those
fucking hands at me.

21:16.800 --> 21:18.450
I'll get that stupid barrette!

21:18.600 --> 21:20.443
I'll take that barrette right
out of your fucking hair!

21:20.600 --> 21:22.489
Stop, stop, stop!

21:22.840 --> 21:25.366
Both of you... my office now.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.764
Nope. Not in there.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.322
There is nothing I can do, Mullins.
The FBI has jurisdiction.

21:31.680 --> 21:33.250
Maybe they're in here.

21:33.640 --> 21:34.846
Stop. Will you stop?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.046
Nope, they're not in there.

21:36.520 --> 21:37.851
What is she doing?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.443
She's looking for my balls.

21:41.040 --> 21:43.042
Hey, if anyone sees
the Captain's balls...

21:43.760 --> 21:46.923
...let me know. They're about
this big, but a lot tinier.

21:47.280 --> 21:50.443
They're like a pea... or
like a ball bearing.

21:50.760 --> 21:54.287
Or if you've ever seen a mouse
ball, about half that size.

21:54.600 --> 21:57.126
Incredibly tiny. They're
like really, really tiny...

21:57.280 --> 21:59.886
...little girl balls.
If little girls had balls.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.806
So if you find little,
tiny girl balls...

22:03.080 --> 22:05.924
...that are so fucking
tiny and shriveled up...

22:06.240 --> 22:09.244
...let me know, because I'll put
them right back up his scrotum!

22:09.400 --> 22:10.686
Knock it off.

22:10.840 --> 22:12.604
How about you do
something for once?

22:12.760 --> 22:14.000
What do you want me to do?

22:14.160 --> 22:15.321
Have my back

22:15.400 --> 22:17.846
and stop being so goddamn
disappointing like everybody else!

22:18.000 --> 22:19.331
Well, that was professional.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.090
Was that not professional?
Here.

22:21.240 --> 22:23.891
Let me be professional. Let
me help you pick up your bag.

22:24.040 --> 22:25.121
That's very mature.

22:26.360 --> 22:28.761
Let me just
straighten that shit up.

22:29.040 --> 22:30.565
Oh, wait, hey!

22:30.720 --> 22:33.166
Good news! Good news,
I found his balls!

22:33.320 --> 22:37.405
In a clear sack! Yeah, enjoy that.
Shove those back up there.

22:38.200 --> 22:39.565
Cop of the year!

22:39.920 --> 22:41.410
Keep it up!

22:42.640 --> 22:44.324
This job is destroying me.

22:45.880 --> 22:47.120
You know how old I am?

22:48.560 --> 22:49.846
58?

22:50.240 --> 22:52.163
I'm 43 years old.

22:52.320 --> 22:53.606
Mmm-hmm.

22:53.680 --> 22:55.330
Well, I always round up.

22:55.560 --> 22:58.131
I have a five-year-old son
who calls me grandpa!

22:58.520 --> 23:01.603
So, uh... anyhoo, sir...

23:02.080 --> 23:04.367
...if you could
just... you know...

23:04.840 --> 23:07.161
...keep her... away from me...

23:07.520 --> 23:09.841
...that would
be... very helpful.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.880
She stole your keys,
didn't she?

23:12.200 --> 23:14.202
Yes, she did. Do you know
where I can find her?

23:14.360 --> 23:17.125
She's probably at O'Flanagan's.
It's a bar down the street.

23:17.280 --> 23:19.726
It's a little divey. You
might want to wear a vest.

23:23.760 --> 23:25.649
<i>Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack</i>

23:25.720 --> 23:27.404
<i>I'm next to that cheese
like rat traps</i>

23:27.480 --> 23:29.005
<i>On top of that green
like grass ass</i>

23:29.080 --> 23:30.445
<i>That's over y'all head
like snapbacks</i>

23:30.520 --> 23:32.280
<i>I get it where I fit in,
put up then I put in</i>

23:32.320 --> 23:33.924
<i>Tryna find an ass
I can put my fucking foot in</i>

23:34.000 --> 23:35.161
<i>Run this shit,
no, I run this shit</i>

23:35.240 --> 23:37.041
<i>Don't give one fuck, bitch
I done this shit...</i>

23:37.160 --> 23:40.164
Sir, is this place open?
Is there a door... Oh.

23:41.040 --> 23:45.602
So there is. Could you point
it out to me with your finger?

23:46.920 --> 23:48.524
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

23:58.440 --> 24:01.125
ASHBURN: Hand them over.
Give me the keys. Now.

24:02.440 --> 24:03.441
Oh, my God.

24:03.600 --> 24:05.125
Did you drop something?

24:06.160 --> 24:07.366
I apologize.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.121
You are so concerned about
taking down a guy like Rojas...

24:11.160 --> 24:12.525
...wasting all this time

24:12.680 --> 24:15.280
when I could have stopped a drug
lord who is far more dangerous...

24:15.360 --> 24:17.442
...and supplies to
people like Rojas.

24:17.640 --> 24:19.563
Bullshit. Who?

24:20.520 --> 24:22.329
Okay, you want to
see some bull feces?

24:22.520 --> 24:24.249
I think I said "bullshit".

24:24.440 --> 24:26.727
Here's some bull poo-poo.
How does that look?

24:28.120 --> 24:30.327
See that? Oh, come on.
I got a kid here.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.641
Oh, I'm so sorry.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.086
I'm very, very sorry.

24:33.280 --> 24:35.601
Wait a minute, this is a bar.

24:35.920 --> 24:38.207
No, absolutely not.
No, no, no, no.

24:38.400 --> 24:40.402
Why do I not know
who Simon Larkin is?

24:40.560 --> 24:43.325
That would probably be because
the FBI knows more than you do.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.165
Anything happening in my
neighborhood I have a right to know.

24:46.320 --> 24:49.324
No, you actually don't.
You want to know.

24:49.480 --> 24:50.811
And you do not
have the clearance

24:50.880 --> 24:54.168
that would allow you to read
everything that is in this file.

24:54.360 --> 24:55.521
Okay, all right!

24:56.040 --> 24:58.247
When bad shit happens
in my neighborhood,

24:58.320 --> 25:00.561
I get a little
passionate about it.

25:00.960 --> 25:03.725
I shouldn't have read your files.
I went too far.

25:03.920 --> 25:06.082
Well, I accept your apology.

25:06.720 --> 25:09.803
But you need to understand that
this is a highly important case.

25:10.040 --> 25:12.850
And the information is
highly, highly sensitive.

25:12.920 --> 25:14.331
Therefore we have
these clearances.

25:14.560 --> 25:18.246
I don't have the clearances.
Right? I mean, you are...

25:18.560 --> 25:20.722
You are, wow, FBI.

25:21.080 --> 25:24.084
I mean, you are a goddamn
angel of the law.

25:24.360 --> 25:26.044
Well, that's a little...

25:26.240 --> 25:28.481
I want you to spread those
wings and just soar.

25:32.200 --> 25:33.690
Watch it!

25:34.280 --> 25:36.442
You watch it.
I'm a federal agent.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.964
WOMAN: Oh, yeah? Well, guess what, you dick!
I'm a federal agent, too!

25:41.200 --> 25:42.964
I work at the post office.

25:43.280 --> 25:47.968
Well, I appreciate the work you do
for us on the ground. Thank you.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.645
You bet your ass you do.

25:49.880 --> 25:52.724
I see no one will be
getting their mail today!

25:53.120 --> 25:54.121
MULLINS: Good burn.

25:54.320 --> 25:56.482
Good burn. You got burned,
you big drunk paddy!

25:56.640 --> 25:58.768
WOMAN: Kiss my cunt,
you twat!

25:58.920 --> 26:01.082
So we are good?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.281
Thank you.
Thank you.

26:03.560 --> 26:04.891
America thanks you.

26:05.080 --> 26:06.206
And I it.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.606
And it you.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.041
Thank you.

26:09.160 --> 26:10.446
Whoa!

26:11.440 --> 26:13.124
Yes, okay.

26:13.800 --> 26:14.801
Good day.

26:16.520 --> 26:17.806
Dumbass.

26:20.920 --> 26:22.684
MULLINS: <i>So how
you been, Jason?</i>

26:23.080 --> 26:24.844
You want to talk
about Simon Larkin?

26:26.160 --> 26:27.525
I never heard of him.

26:27.680 --> 26:28.920
Don't lie to me.

26:29.080 --> 26:31.082
You're my brother,
I know when you're lying.

26:31.280 --> 26:33.487
I'm just a low-level guy.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.286
I heard of Larkin
but I never met him.

26:36.600 --> 26:39.922
He's a goddamn animal, and I'm
trying to keep him from meeting you.

26:40.240 --> 26:43.084
You gonna storm through Boston
and take down a drug lord?

26:43.440 --> 26:44.771
Yeah, I might.

26:45.160 --> 26:46.650
Have you met me?

26:47.280 --> 26:48.281
Yeah, unfortunately.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.490
Yeah, shut up. (CHUCKLES)

26:50.720 --> 26:52.484
Look, I get out tomorrow.

26:52.720 --> 26:55.166
I'm coming home.
I'm gonna be fine.

26:55.320 --> 26:57.004
I promise, all right?

27:14.360 --> 27:17.091
Oh! Never approach me if
I'm not expecting you!

27:17.440 --> 27:19.090
What are you, an animal?

27:19.440 --> 27:20.646
You said you would
stay off my case,

27:20.720 --> 27:24.361
and now I find you in front
of Tatiana's apartment.

27:24.680 --> 27:25.727
I live here.

27:26.120 --> 27:28.521
Oh, that's hilarious.
You know what's not funny?

27:28.720 --> 27:31.087
That you stole a
confidential FBI case file.

27:31.360 --> 27:33.044
I don't remember any of that.

27:33.200 --> 27:36.443
I'm going to say it one more time.
Stand down, Officer.

27:36.800 --> 27:38.006
Fuck off, Officer.

27:38.160 --> 27:40.845
Oh, okay, now you've really done it.
I'm going to call my boss.

27:41.040 --> 27:43.441
Yeah, you do that, tattle tits!

27:44.360 --> 27:45.441
Fucking narc!

27:45.720 --> 27:47.802
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.927
(RINGING)

27:53.120 --> 27:55.248
<i>It's Ashburn, sir.
I need authorization...</i>

27:55.440 --> 27:58.683
...to suspend a police officer
from my investigation.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.884
Ashburn, why is working with local
authorities a problem for you?

28:02.040 --> 28:03.041
<i>Sir, it's not.</i>

28:03.240 --> 28:05.971
I understand how this might
sound coming from me...

28:06.240 --> 28:10.006
...but I think this individual might
actually be mentally unstable.

28:10.160 --> 28:12.527
Her captain says she
grew up on those streets

28:12.600 --> 28:13.601
and knows them
better than anyone.

28:13.720 --> 28:15.563
That seems like an asset
to our investigation.

28:15.920 --> 28:16.967
Sir, I...

28:17.040 --> 28:18.326
No, just work with her.

28:18.560 --> 28:21.006
Show me you can do this
or forget the promotion.

28:24.160 --> 28:28.245
Well, sir, no need to take someone's badge.
I think I can, uh...

28:28.840 --> 28:30.842
I think I can work
something out, sir.

28:31.080 --> 28:32.844
All right. Thank you.

28:34.600 --> 28:36.090
You know, uh...

28:37.360 --> 28:38.850
I just...

28:39.080 --> 28:41.287
I think you and I got off
on the wrong foot.

28:41.440 --> 28:42.521
Oh!

28:42.600 --> 28:44.602
I don't know Boston,
and you obviously have...

28:44.760 --> 28:47.843
...a lot of resources and a lot of
knowledge about the area that could be,

28:47.920 --> 28:49.445
you know, useful.

28:49.600 --> 28:51.364
Probably very.
So, uh...

28:51.600 --> 28:53.364
...maybe we can work
together on this.

28:53.520 --> 28:56.046
I don't need your help
to take down Larkin.

28:56.200 --> 28:58.726
You wouldn't even have known
about Larkin if not for me.

28:58.920 --> 29:01.161
So obviously the FBI can
get information you can't.

29:01.320 --> 29:04.529
And there's a lot more
where that comes from. A lot!

29:04.760 --> 29:07.684
Maybe I just need to hear a little
"I need your help, Mullins."

29:07.840 --> 29:09.171
I won't be doing that.

29:09.320 --> 29:11.163
Okay, then get your
ass back in your car.

29:11.320 --> 29:12.685
This is ridiculous.

29:12.840 --> 29:15.002
I'm an FBI agent.
You're a police officer.

29:15.160 --> 29:16.844
"I need your help, Mullins."

29:17.320 --> 29:18.845
I need your help, Mullins.

29:19.080 --> 29:23.483
What is this, a whisper party? I
want that third floor to hear it.

29:23.960 --> 29:28.170
"I need your help, Mullins." Then
give me a little echo on "Mullins".

29:32.920 --> 29:36.049
I need your help, Mullins,
Mullins, Mullins...

29:37.200 --> 29:38.884
Just move. Move, move!

29:39.160 --> 29:41.640
God! Even in that,
you're annoying.

29:41.920 --> 29:43.649
I will work with you...

29:43.840 --> 29:46.161
...as long as we're clear
that this is my case.

29:46.440 --> 29:48.442
That's actually
not... correct.

29:48.680 --> 29:50.682
Awesome.
Glad you see it my way.

29:50.920 --> 29:52.251
Careful of the car.

29:52.800 --> 29:53.801
Goddamn it.

29:58.480 --> 30:00.403
Stand down.
I got it.

30:00.640 --> 30:02.483
If you just let go...
I got it.

30:02.640 --> 30:03.846
ASHBURN: I have it,
just let me...

30:03.920 --> 30:05.126
MULLINS: I've got it.

30:05.600 --> 30:06.931
I got it.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.604
Oh, shit!

30:12.160 --> 30:14.049
(MUSIC PLAYING FAINTLY)

30:20.720 --> 30:21.767
Ma'am, you, uh...

30:21.880 --> 30:23.609
Just go. Just go.

30:24.400 --> 30:26.767
Let me take the lead on this.
I'm a trained interviewer.

30:26.920 --> 30:29.241
"Interviewer?" What are
you, Barbara Walters?

30:29.400 --> 30:32.085
I thought we'd go in there and
bring in some heat on her.

30:32.240 --> 30:34.242
I'm sorry, what does
that even mean?

30:34.400 --> 30:35.925
Me and you, we're the heat.

30:36.080 --> 30:38.686
We go in there, interrogate her,
scare the shit out of her...

30:38.840 --> 30:40.922
We don't say "interrogation".
It's too aggressive.

30:41.080 --> 30:43.321
Rule number one, catch more
with sugar than with a stick.

30:43.440 --> 30:44.930
That's a horrible
fucking saying.

30:45.080 --> 30:48.289
We like to create a genuine
personal interest in the subject,

30:48.400 --> 30:49.401
allowing them to open up.
(SIGHING)

30:49.480 --> 30:52.484
Then I'll perform instant
personality assessments

30:52.560 --> 30:53.971
based on
the Myers-Briggs theory...

30:54.200 --> 30:56.362
...Thematic
Apperception Tests and...

30:56.520 --> 30:57.726
...a few others I
won't bore you with.

30:57.800 --> 31:00.371
Well, I am balls deep
in boredom.

31:00.640 --> 31:02.165
All right, as long as
you don't do that

31:02.240 --> 31:03.651
whole long explanation again...

31:03.840 --> 31:05.490
...we'll try it
your way first.

31:05.720 --> 31:07.006
Only because you're older.

31:07.080 --> 31:08.320
Oh, my God.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.080
Tatiana Krumova, I am Special
Agent Sarah Ashburn...

31:17.240 --> 31:19.607
...and this is Detective Mullins.
Detective Mullins.

31:20.320 --> 31:23.529
And we'd like to ask you a few questions
if you could give us a moment.

31:23.760 --> 31:28.322
(FOREIGN ACCENT) Oh, shoot. You know, now is bad.
I'm making butter.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.051
How about other time?

31:30.240 --> 31:32.360
If you could just give... How
about right fucking now?

31:32.480 --> 31:34.164
Right fucking now!

31:34.400 --> 31:37.165
Well, Tatiana, thank you.
This is very kind of you.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.561
So...

31:38.840 --> 31:40.842
How long have you lived here?

31:41.200 --> 31:43.043
I've lived here
since I moved in.

31:44.400 --> 31:47.085
Okay, that's
very... very helpful.

31:47.400 --> 31:49.562
Okay, we'll get
a little more specific.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.843
What do you do for a living?

31:52.000 --> 31:53.365
I know what this asshole
does for a living.

31:53.440 --> 31:54.680
What you know, asshole?

31:54.840 --> 31:56.001
Sugar, no stick.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.924
It is Bulgarian, is it not?

31:58.080 --> 31:59.605
No, I'm fucking French!

31:59.760 --> 32:01.444
Oh, Jesus.
Tatiana...

32:01.640 --> 32:04.291
(SPEAKING BULGARIAN)

32:04.640 --> 32:06.210
I don't understand
what you are saying.

32:06.560 --> 32:07.846
Nice bullshit Bulgarian.

32:07.920 --> 32:09.410
That was perfect Bulgarian.

32:09.600 --> 32:11.409
I mean I don't understand
what you are talking about!

32:11.480 --> 32:13.847
Why I go to jail
when I don't do shits?

32:13.960 --> 32:18.966
Ah! So she did understand what I
was saying, just not the context.

32:19.160 --> 32:20.491
Oh, sweet God.

32:20.720 --> 32:23.087
All right, Rosetta Stone,
you're done.

32:23.480 --> 32:24.561
(MOANING)

32:24.640 --> 32:26.005
Ugh! Oh, Jesus.

32:26.680 --> 32:28.523
How many porns have been
made on this couch?

32:28.680 --> 32:31.286
Oh, this couch not of your satisfaction?
You're not comfy?

32:31.440 --> 32:33.442
I'll get comfy. When
my foot's up your ass.

32:33.520 --> 32:34.521
Wow.

32:34.600 --> 32:36.648
That'll make me really comfy.
Don't poke me!

32:36.800 --> 32:38.802
Tatiana, I want to
get really real.

32:38.960 --> 32:41.122
You ready to get real?
Let's get real.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.847
Okay, we both know you've been
blowing shit up your nose all day.

32:45.000 --> 32:47.446
Man, I get it. There's nothing
more I'd love to do than...

32:47.600 --> 32:50.683
...slip into my camisole, put my
feet up, have a little smack.

32:50.880 --> 32:52.928
Real good time,
maybe a couple cold ones,

32:53.000 --> 32:55.048
a little chip and dip,
watch some cartoons.

32:55.360 --> 32:57.203
I'd get a big bowl of coke...

32:57.360 --> 32:59.761
I'd put my face in it, cut
it with a little Ritalin...

32:59.920 --> 33:01.604
Heaven on fucking earth, right?
Sure.

33:01.760 --> 33:03.967
I'd camp out all week
for tickets to that show.

33:04.160 --> 33:05.400
What is this, <i>Training Day?</i>

33:05.480 --> 33:07.926
All fucking week
I'd camp out for that!

33:08.200 --> 33:11.363
But you, you piece of shit, you've
been rolling deep for a long time.

33:11.520 --> 33:14.364
And now it's time you open
up that goddamn mouth

33:14.480 --> 33:15.760
and tell us what
we want to know.

33:15.920 --> 33:19.163
You got good point. I tell you what.
I open my mouth.

33:19.400 --> 33:21.528
You get the fuck
out my house now!

33:21.680 --> 33:23.330
How's that for open mouth?

33:23.520 --> 33:24.965
Fuck out! Get fuck out!

33:25.040 --> 33:26.530
Yeah, I'll get the fuck out.

33:26.920 --> 33:27.921
All right.

33:28.240 --> 33:31.926
You should really stop smoking
because it's an awfully bad habit.

33:32.160 --> 33:34.080
You're leaving half your
lipstick in the ashtray.

33:34.160 --> 33:38.370
I had a great aunt that lost
most of her teeth to smoking.

33:38.640 --> 33:39.641
Good to know.

33:39.800 --> 33:42.167
A lot of fistfights,
too, but mostly smoking.

33:42.320 --> 33:44.641
We're gonna get
out of your hair.

33:44.840 --> 33:45.887
That is not front door.

33:46.680 --> 33:48.364

Oh, my gosh!

33:52.160 --> 33:53.200
TATIANA: That's my mother!

33:53.280 --> 33:55.123
Do you have balloons
of horse up your ass?

33:55.280 --> 33:56.441
You break my fucking door!

33:56.520 --> 33:57.806
Stand down, Officer.

33:57.960 --> 33:59.769
Who closes the door
to take a shit?

34:00.440 --> 34:01.805
Humans do.

34:02.120 --> 34:03.645
Don't touch underpants!

34:03.840 --> 34:06.127
Get out, bull in china shop!
Out of my house!

34:06.240 --> 34:07.526
What the fuck's wrong with you?

34:08.280 --> 34:11.123
Wow, you are just
all stick and no sugar.

34:11.480 --> 34:12.811
Did you get
the cigarette or not?

34:14.639 --> 34:17.120
Uh, yeah... of course I did.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.481
Yeah.

34:19.800 --> 34:23.246
I snagged these matches, too. I think
our guy likes to go to Club Ekko.

34:25.000 --> 34:26.331
Really?
Yes, really.

34:26.840 --> 34:28.603
Let's find out, shall we?

34:28.800 --> 34:32.009
Hang on. The couch was disgusting.
I need to wash my hands.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.842
Wait a minute,
you do live here?

34:35.120 --> 34:36.645
That's what I said.

34:37.159 --> 34:38.366
Oh.

34:42.120 --> 34:45.203
Wow, your windows
are all boarded up.

34:46.280 --> 34:47.360
Yeah, I've got the glass,

34:47.480 --> 34:49.801
I just don't have the...
you know, window blankets.

34:50.000 --> 34:52.002
The curtains?
You mean the curtains?

34:52.239 --> 34:54.083
Whatever. Okay?

34:57.680 --> 34:59.205
That's just my family.

35:00.320 --> 35:01.401
ASHBURN: Oh.

35:01.480 --> 35:03.482
Yeah, it's sweet.

35:03.800 --> 35:04.847
You want something to eat?

35:04.960 --> 35:07.361
I didn't finish my submarine
sandwich the other day.

35:07.640 --> 35:09.051
No, thank you.

35:09.360 --> 35:12.011
Sorry I don't have poached
eggs in rubies for you.

35:12.320 --> 35:15.483
No, I don't mean
to be rude, but...

35:15.840 --> 35:18.844
...one could catch a MRSA
infection in here, that's all.

35:19.000 --> 35:20.570
What part of that wasn't rude?

35:20.760 --> 35:23.491
Just for your own well-being.
For example, that door.

35:23.840 --> 35:25.330
That door has no
way of locking.

35:25.400 --> 35:27.164
Someone could barge in at any moment.
It's not safe.

35:27.320 --> 35:29.322
No one's coming in here...

35:29.520 --> 35:32.171
...because they know
I keep this fully stocked.

35:32.840 --> 35:34.171
Oh, my God.

35:34.400 --> 35:35.481
Yeah, I know.

35:35.560 --> 35:37.403
A Marlin 1894CB?

35:37.680 --> 35:39.409
Is that an FN PS90?

35:39.560 --> 35:40.846
Yeah! Nice one.

35:41.000 --> 35:42.490
You have all of this
in your house?

35:42.560 --> 35:44.005
You didn't even
mention my baby.

35:44.200 --> 35:45.531
Look at this.
Oh!

35:46.200 --> 35:47.850
My little pride and joy.

35:51.720 --> 35:54.291
This little beauty could
vaporize an above-ground pool.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.249
If you didn't want
the pool anymore.

35:56.400 --> 35:57.731
No kidding.
Pretty, huh?

35:57.920 --> 36:00.400
Yeah. How do you refuse
that sales pitch, huh?

36:00.880 --> 36:03.042
You don't.
Unless you're an asshole.

36:05.920 --> 36:07.888
I haven't seen one of these
since World War II.

36:08.040 --> 36:10.566
No! God,
that... occasionally ticks.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.723
Put it back slowly.
Slowly!

36:13.200 --> 36:14.929
Like half that speed.

36:15.440 --> 36:17.204
Half that speed!

36:18.040 --> 36:20.042
Stop shaking.
Put your pinky down.

36:20.880 --> 36:23.326
I got it on eBay. It was supposed
to be bigger and different.

36:23.400 --> 36:24.401
It doesn't matter.

36:24.480 --> 36:26.801
I'm gonna "Bad Feedback"
his ass, though.

36:42.920 --> 36:43.921
LEVY: All right, ladies.

36:44.080 --> 36:45.844
Here's the DNA results
from the book of matches

36:45.920 --> 36:47.922
and the cigarette butt
you got from Tatiana's.

36:48.080 --> 36:51.448
We pulled two sets of prints.
First one's a real nut job.

36:51.760 --> 36:54.923
Look at this. Reckless
driving, assault, arson.

36:55.080 --> 36:57.606
Oh, God.
Ahem! Really?

He's my assistant.

to finish reading your files.

stay out of my business

you in the teeth.

about the cigarette?

37:12.680 --> 37:14.205
Okay. Hank LeSoire.

37:14.360 --> 37:15.361
Local businessman.

Got tons of ties to the
drug world, black market...

37:17.640 --> 37:20.484
...as well as prostitution rings.
Co-owner of Club Ekko.

37:20.640 --> 37:23.849
It looks like we found our distributor.
Can you back that up, please?

37:24.000 --> 37:25.490
Back up to which one?
That.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.047
I'm not into you!

invading my space.

out of my areola.

LEVY: I haven't been able to. Guy
gets a new prepaid every other week.

37:40.840 --> 37:42.205
By the time I can
get his phone number

37:42.320 --> 37:43.685
and hack in,
he's got a new one.

37:43.840 --> 37:46.047
Let's get a bug into the
phone he does have.

37:46.120 --> 37:47.326
I want to know what
he's saying this week.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.681
Just get a court order and a bug.
We'll do it ourselves.

37:49.800 --> 37:52.200

at least buy me dinner first.

37:52.320 --> 37:54.243

I'll get that to you ASAP.

was being charming.

I don't know what to say to that.
Now I just feel bad for you.

Okay, so LeSoire
co-owns Club Ekko.

38:08.840 --> 38:12.003
Let's start surveilling it and figure
out how to get a bug in his phone.

38:12.160 --> 38:13.366
Tell me everything
you know about it.

38:13.440 --> 38:14.720

a shitty club downtown.

38:14.840 --> 38:16.330
I've never been inside,

38:16.400 --> 38:19.006
but there's always a line of
awful people around the corner.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.527

times to break up fights.

38:21.680 --> 38:23.170
Oh, shit.
What's wrong?

38:23.360 --> 38:26.523
Just don't look. Don't look!

I really enjoyed our night together.
You just disappeared on me.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.490
Yeah, I know.
I was there.

38:33.640 --> 38:35.688
Can I take you to dinner,
or a movie, or something?

38:35.840 --> 38:39.083
Do you not hear how pathetic
everything out of your mouth sounds?

38:39.240 --> 38:42.050
There's a girl out there
for you, but it's not me.

38:42.200 --> 38:45.329
Maybe it's her. Her lady business
is like an old dirty attic.

lights and doll shoes and shit.

clean that out for her?

misrepresentation of my vagina.

I went to undergrad at Yale.

39:31.920 --> 39:35.766
I have been with the Bureau
for about twelve years.

that guy was innocent.

He's been in jail for eleven months.
That would make me...

you said was actually factual.

the judge you fucked up.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.806
I will grab the cell, place the bug
in it, tell him he dropped the phone.

41:05.000 --> 41:07.002
It's something I like
to call a "cop drop".

41:07.240 --> 41:09.368
Yeah, I got it.
Okay... here we go.

41:13.000 --> 41:15.207
My God, there are no wires
attached to this thing.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.444
What is that? Gum?
Or is it Silly Putty?

41:18.960 --> 41:20.644
Don't touch it!
It's a condom.

41:20.960 --> 41:23.122
(GAGGING) All right,
he's on the move.

41:24.640 --> 41:27.440
We got to get out there and shake our
asses like the rest of the foxes.

41:27.560 --> 41:30.723
Oh, yes, dancing to get close to him.
Fantastic idea!

41:31.080 --> 41:32.650
Jesus. Don't!

41:33.000 --> 41:34.490
Don't do anything you're doing.

41:34.560 --> 41:35.686
But he's over that way.

41:35.880 --> 41:37.644
Let's just go find a bathroom.

41:38.320 --> 41:40.766
I told you, I don't have
to use the bathroom!

41:40.920 --> 41:43.764
Did I ask about your bathroom habits?
You are killing us out there.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.526
You don't fit in! Take
off that fucking jacket.

41:46.680 --> 41:48.170
This is a good jacket.

41:48.320 --> 41:50.129
You look like you're
gonna set up a table

41:50.200 --> 41:52.009
and do their taxes.
Take it off!

41:52.360 --> 41:53.691
This is ridiculous.

41:53.760 --> 41:55.091
Your shitty jacket?
My God!

41:55.360 --> 41:57.931
Okay, jacket's off.
Jacket's off.

41:58.280 --> 42:00.965
I can't watch whatever
process is about to happen.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.525
Now unbutton your buttons.

42:02.680 --> 42:04.091
I'm a federal agent!

42:04.160 --> 42:05.844
I know, and you look like one.

42:06.040 --> 42:08.691
You think you'll bump into him and
he won't think something's up?

42:08.880 --> 42:11.281
Fine. How's that? Is that good?
Can we go?

42:11.520 --> 42:13.284
No, I think it's getting worse.

42:13.440 --> 42:15.204
My fear is I'm gonna
put you in a bikini

42:15.280 --> 42:17.009
and you'll still look like
a fucking bank teller.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.481
Do you have to
use that language?

42:19.680 --> 42:21.330
I'm trying to make a point!

42:21.480 --> 42:22.720
I'm saying your face

42:22.800 --> 42:24.529
and whatever is underneath this

42:24.600 --> 42:26.250
shitty outfit is
maybe not terrible.

42:26.520 --> 42:28.682
I'll have you know I
dress appropriately.

42:28.880 --> 42:31.042
I got it!
It's when this...

42:31.200 --> 42:34.409
...your big flapping mouth, starts
running, and then you put...

42:35.200 --> 42:39.967
...this getup on top of it, and it's just...
it's a boner killer.

42:40.240 --> 42:41.969
I'm gonna help you.
What are you doing?

42:42.240 --> 42:43.480
Now I just want you to shut up.

42:43.600 --> 42:44.886
(SIGHING) Oh, my God.

42:45.480 --> 42:48.643
Oh, my God! I only brought
five of these to Boston!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.570
I'll cut the other four.

42:51.080 --> 42:52.889
God, that's terrible fabric!

42:53.040 --> 42:54.690
Just get that off your wrist.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.401
This one was of
my favorite ones.

42:57.640 --> 42:59.051
Just take it off.
Take it off!

42:59.120 --> 43:00.565
Okay, just give me a second!

43:03.080 --> 43:05.162
Okay, I look like
I've been attacked.

43:05.400 --> 43:06.925
That's not my fault.

43:07.080 --> 43:09.162
Oh, it's my fault? Let
me even out the bottom.

43:09.320 --> 43:11.846
Would you stop
carving up my clothes?

43:12.040 --> 43:14.407
I'm making shorts!
Everybody likes shorts.

43:14.720 --> 43:16.722
(SIGHING)
Jesus! Hold still!

43:18.160 --> 43:21.209
That feels... awkward. Weird.
Don't touch that area.

43:21.360 --> 43:24.204
Don't duck down, or you're
gonna suck my hand up there.

43:25.360 --> 43:27.681
Will you stop
pulling my pants off?

43:27.920 --> 43:29.684
Jesus!
What?

43:30.120 --> 43:31.281
What are those?

43:31.760 --> 43:33.444
What are those?
Stop it!

43:33.760 --> 43:35.842
They're my Spanx. They
hold everything together.

43:36.520 --> 43:38.887
Why? What's gonna
come popping out?

43:39.040 --> 43:41.725
Nothing! It just keeps everything
where it's supposed to be.

43:41.960 --> 43:43.450
Shit, like medically?

43:43.640 --> 43:45.881
No, not medically.
Just to...

43:46.040 --> 43:48.725
It just keeps it right
where it's supposed to be.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.964
You got to vent that furnace.

43:52.400 --> 43:53.840
That's a lot of
compression and heat.

43:54.000 --> 43:56.082
It gets plenty of
ventilation, thank you.

43:56.160 --> 43:58.003
My hand's a foot off
and it's on fire.

43:58.160 --> 43:59.571
Then why don't you
cut them shorter

43:59.640 --> 44:01.244
because no one can
see my cervix yet?

44:01.400 --> 44:03.846
I'll cut them shorter. No, stop it!
We're finished.

44:04.240 --> 44:05.321
Okay, let's do you now.

44:05.400 --> 44:07.801
I don't need that!

44:08.240 --> 44:09.287
What do you mean?

44:09.360 --> 44:11.328
I put my sexuality
out through motion.

44:12.360 --> 44:15.204
When this starts going, it's all...
You'll get it.

44:15.400 --> 44:17.926
So I have to look like this and
you get to look like that?

44:18.240 --> 44:19.924
I know, it's not fair.

44:20.520 --> 44:21.601
We gotta tackle the helmet.

44:23.760 --> 44:26.604
It's got a real style
memory, huh?

44:27.080 --> 44:28.764
You gotta flip that shit over.

44:28.840 --> 44:30.171
Bend over.
Why?

44:30.240 --> 44:32.447
You look like Darth Vader.
Just flip it over.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.691
God Almighty.

44:34.760 --> 44:37.161
I gotta just finger tease
the shit out of this.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.447
Wait. What?
I'm gonna finger tease it.

44:40.080 --> 44:42.082
What is that?
What does that mean?

44:42.200 --> 44:43.884
Not what you want it to mean.

44:44.600 --> 44:46.443
(LOUD MUSIC PLAYING)

44:49.280 --> 44:50.281
Hit it!

44:53.080 --> 44:54.411
What are you looking at?

44:54.600 --> 44:57.285
I like how your friend's shorts
make me feel in my shorts.

44:57.440 --> 45:00.125
I am sorry. That was much
cruder than I meant it to be.

45:00.640 --> 45:03.166
I stand corrected on the shorts.
Let's proceed.

45:03.480 --> 45:05.323
Oh, God, we're dead.

45:05.680 --> 45:06.806
ASHBURN: At one o'clock.

45:06.880 --> 45:07.961
MULLINS: Let's do this.

45:08.880 --> 45:09.881
All right.

45:11.080 --> 45:13.242
Get in there.
Get in there.

45:14.200 --> 45:16.089
How do you get in?
I don't know how.

45:16.160 --> 45:17.286
Back it in.

45:17.520 --> 45:19.921
Get in there. Get your hands
in and get the phone.

45:20.120 --> 45:21.485
Okay, Pinky.

45:21.800 --> 45:23.484
Do the cop drop.
I'm trying to!

45:23.680 --> 45:25.011
Do the fucking cop drop!

45:25.080 --> 45:26.684
I can't do it
from this position!

45:28.760 --> 45:30.762
No. No, no, no!

45:31.440 --> 45:33.681
Okay, coming in one more time.
Get her away.

45:34.480 --> 45:37.165
MULLINS: I got her! But
you're like a fucking nanny!

45:37.360 --> 45:39.203
Picture time!

45:39.640 --> 45:41.802
Damn it. Can somebody
get my phone?

45:41.920 --> 45:44.048
ASHBURN: I got it!
I got it! Let go!

45:44.360 --> 45:47.364
LeSOIRE: Thanks a lot, bro. And close
a couple buttons... club policy.

45:48.120 --> 45:49.451
ASHBURN: God bless!

45:49.760 --> 45:51.091
MULLINS: I got
the orange one!

45:51.280 --> 45:52.645
I need some water.

45:52.800 --> 45:54.290
Stop it! Stop it!

45:54.400 --> 45:55.925
I will fucking kill you.

45:56.240 --> 45:57.241
Where is he?

45:57.440 --> 45:59.363
Get in there.
Okay, one more time.

45:59.520 --> 46:00.601
Get her away.

46:00.680 --> 46:02.281
MULLINS: Jesus,
there's too many of them!

46:02.400 --> 46:03.731
LeSOIRE: Hello.
ASHBURN: Hi.

46:03.880 --> 46:06.884
Your moves are weird
as shit... and I love it.

46:07.040 --> 46:08.451
You have really soft hair.

46:08.520 --> 46:10.045
Oh, yeah,
it's the shampoo move!

46:10.320 --> 46:11.970
MULLINS: Use your boobs!

46:12.320 --> 46:14.084
You see these?
Oh, God, yeah.

46:14.400 --> 46:18.246
I'm looking, I'm liking.
Oh, girl, so great!

46:20.080 --> 46:21.650
Hey, what is this?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.729
What's going on? Whoa!

46:25.880 --> 46:28.281
Oh, God, back it in.
Whoa, please!

46:29.160 --> 46:30.161
Hi.
Hi.

46:30.480 --> 46:33.006
You're the first chick over
forty to give me a boner.

46:34.280 --> 46:35.441
Great.

46:35.720 --> 46:36.767
Want to go get a drink?

46:36.840 --> 46:38.569
Okay. Yeah.

46:41.280 --> 46:42.964
Maybe. Maybe.

46:43.600 --> 46:45.443
That's the only reason
girls hit on me.

46:45.520 --> 46:46.681
Oh, sorry, yeah.

46:46.920 --> 46:48.922
Every night, the hottest
chicks come in here.

46:49.080 --> 46:52.448
They're like, "There's LeSoire!"
Short skirts, too much makeup.

46:52.760 --> 46:54.125
Looking like fucking gremlins.

46:54.200 --> 46:55.440
Oh, I hate that!

46:55.640 --> 46:58.769
Don't feed them after midnight, right?
They turn into more sluts.

47:00.360 --> 47:01.885
Give me a whiskey.

47:02.120 --> 47:03.770
I just noticed that lion.

47:03.960 --> 47:05.450
That is amazing.
Fuck!

47:05.600 --> 47:08.126
Who the fuck keeps putting
lions in the back?

47:08.920 --> 47:09.921
Fourteen dollars.

47:10.080 --> 47:11.081
Fourteen dollars?

47:12.080 --> 47:14.082
Is it magic fucking whiskey?

47:14.240 --> 47:17.403
Do I get a motorcycle with it?
Is it served in Jesus's shoe?

47:17.600 --> 47:18.761
Can I sit in your lap?

47:18.840 --> 47:19.921
Obviously.

47:21.200 --> 47:22.281
I like where this is going.

47:22.360 --> 47:23.407
ASHBURN: Me, too.

47:26.400 --> 47:27.561
I would love to!

Get her out of here.

I'll find you. I'll find you.

Ooh!

48:13.640 --> 48:15.642
I have to say that
was pretty awesome.

48:15.920 --> 48:18.491
It really was. Put her there.
Put her there!

48:18.800 --> 48:20.643
No, put her there.

Don't do that.

No, I was a precision

50:12.400 --> 50:14.607
Obviously you have no idea
who you are speaking with.

50:14.720 --> 50:15.960
I'm Federal Agent
Sarah Ashburn.

50:16.040 --> 50:18.805
Yes, I'm sure your credentials
are quite impressive,

50:18.920 --> 50:20.922
as is your choice
of... wardrobe.

50:21.120 --> 50:22.485
Nice hot pants.
You might want to try

50:22.560 --> 50:24.449
shaving above
the knee next time.

50:24.600 --> 50:27.285
Are you giving beauty tips?
Do you own a fucking mirror?

50:27.440 --> 50:31.081
Listen. This whole "female
professionals in the workplace" thing,

50:31.160 --> 50:32.241
I'm fine with it.

50:32.560 --> 50:35.450
But the problem, all due
respect with you people...

50:35.600 --> 50:38.126
...is that you get all excited,
your emotions take over...

50:38.280 --> 50:40.806
...your hormones kick in, you're
riding the cotton pony...

50:40.960 --> 50:42.371
Next thing you know
you're complimenting

50:42.440 --> 50:44.124
the bad guy on
his fucking couch!

50:44.320 --> 50:46.721
Oh, all due respect to you,
who's your wife?

50:46.800 --> 50:48.529
A five-pound bag of flour
with a hole in it?

50:48.680 --> 50:50.284
ADAM: Hey, hey, hey!
Listen, ma'ams.

50:50.480 --> 50:53.086
We've been cramped inside
this van for two months.

50:53.240 --> 50:54.571
We're not gonna
let you swoop in

50:54.640 --> 50:55.926
from nowhere and
take all the credit.

50:56.080 --> 50:58.321
I don't want to see you two
anywhere near this case!

50:58.760 --> 51:00.489
We have got
informants everywhere!

51:00.640 --> 51:02.324
We've got
surveillance everywhere!

51:02.400 --> 51:03.686
We do not need
the two of you...

51:03.840 --> 51:06.320
...coming in with your estrogen
flying at full speed...

51:06.480 --> 51:09.927
...sticking out in the middle of broad
daylight fucking things up for us!

51:10.080 --> 51:12.651
Because the two of us are
gonna bring these guys in.

51:13.840 --> 51:15.330
Fuck you, chalk balls!

51:15.560 --> 51:17.403
Not even on your birthday,
sweetheart.

51:18.640 --> 51:20.165
That's right, keep walking.

51:21.320 --> 51:22.685
This isn't over.

51:24.440 --> 51:28.001
FYI, we women were born
with hair on our legs.

51:33.360 --> 51:34.521
You don't have to stop.

51:34.600 --> 51:35.840
What are you doing? Whoa!

51:36.080 --> 51:38.128
(DOOR ALARM BEEPING)

51:38.960 --> 51:40.200
(SLAMS DOOR SHUT)

51:41.200 --> 51:43.282
You want to tell me
what was wrong back there?

51:43.360 --> 51:44.361
Nothing.

51:44.440 --> 51:46.204
I saw your face when
you watched the footage.

51:47.040 --> 51:50.647
It looked like you saw someone you knew.
Possibly your brother?

51:51.360 --> 51:54.204
You did not read that
from my fucking face.

51:54.520 --> 51:57.171
You read my file, didn't you?
God, you're an asshole!

51:57.320 --> 51:59.129
Yes, I read it,
but it is my job

51:59.200 --> 52:00.440
to know everything
about a case,

52:00.520 --> 52:01.560
including who I work with.

52:01.800 --> 52:02.961
I don't like that.

52:03.200 --> 52:05.328
We should talk to him tomorrow.

52:06.120 --> 52:07.645
Where is he?

52:07.880 --> 52:09.564
Probably at my parents'.

52:09.840 --> 52:11.842
Well then... let's
go to your parents'.

52:12.160 --> 52:14.401
No, I can't go to my parents'.

52:14.720 --> 52:15.767
Why?

52:15.840 --> 52:17.649
I'm the one that
put him in jail.

52:20.240 --> 52:21.401
Okay, never mind.

52:23.360 --> 52:25.362
It's not like I liked doing it.

52:25.560 --> 52:28.245
He got mixed up with a lot
of really bad people.

52:28.560 --> 52:29.891
And then he started...

52:30.560 --> 52:33.564
He started using that shit. I
just had to get him out of there.

52:34.240 --> 52:37.084
You know, ironically, a lot
of people become addicted...

52:37.240 --> 52:39.846
...when they're in prison.
I think it's like...

52:40.080 --> 52:43.243
...80%-85% of the inmates
require treatments.

52:44.400 --> 52:45.447
I hate you.

52:45.520 --> 52:46.726
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.

52:46.920 --> 52:50.049
But I actually wasn't finished.
I was going to say...

52:53.880 --> 52:55.928
Why can't you just be quiet?

53:11.600 --> 53:12.761
(SNIPPING)

53:39.080 --> 53:40.161
What the F?

53:40.600 --> 53:42.443
These are cloth.
They're nice.

53:42.600 --> 53:44.284
I could have shot you!

53:44.480 --> 53:47.165
Oh, I'm sorry, do you not like
someone invading your privacy?

53:47.320 --> 53:51.803
Oh, come on. I glanced at your file.
You broke into my home!

53:52.120 --> 53:54.122
I care about who
I'm working with, too.

53:54.360 --> 53:56.362
And it's a little uncomfortable

53:56.440 --> 53:58.363
that you feel the need
to travel with trophies.

53:58.520 --> 54:00.045
It's not what you think.

54:00.200 --> 54:02.567
They moved me up here,
rented this apartment,

54:02.640 --> 54:03.880
and that is all my stuff.

54:04.120 --> 54:07.681
These four shitty, sad boxes... this is it?
This is your life?

54:07.960 --> 54:08.961
Yes.

54:10.000 --> 54:12.844
Oh, God. I don't think that
could be any sadder if you...

54:13.000 --> 54:14.490
...threw it all
in the trash bag

54:14.560 --> 54:16.210
and started
dragging it behind you.

54:16.560 --> 54:19.450
You use coffee filters for
toilet paper at your house.

54:19.600 --> 54:21.602
I'm buying them anyway.
They have a dual purpose.

54:21.800 --> 54:23.325
That's not what they're for.

54:23.480 --> 54:26.324
Yeah, real fancy-pants.
I see it. I see it in here.

54:26.600 --> 54:28.682
Looks like you were pretty
cool in high school, huh?

54:28.840 --> 54:31.286
Yes. Yes, I was.
But what...

54:31.480 --> 54:32.811
Because you weren't.

54:33.080 --> 54:35.242
You know what that girl's not?
That girl's not cool.

54:35.400 --> 54:37.721
My favorite part is you
only have two signatures...

54:37.920 --> 54:39.410
...both by teachers.

54:39.600 --> 54:43.366
Mrs. Burke said, "Have a good
summer." That's a personal touch.

54:43.800 --> 54:45.689
My real favorite is this one.

54:46.600 --> 54:48.284
"It'll get better."

54:48.680 --> 54:50.011
Yes, fine.

54:50.440 --> 54:52.204
Okay, now we're even.

54:53.040 --> 54:54.041
Okay.

54:54.280 --> 54:55.645
I see you have a cat.

54:57.520 --> 54:58.521
Yep.

54:59.160 --> 55:02.767
Is he around? Because I'd like
to, you know, pet him and stuff.

55:03.240 --> 55:06.642
He... ran away, uh,
when I was in New York.

55:07.960 --> 55:09.246
(EXHALES)

55:11.440 --> 55:13.681
Oh, God, that
kind of tears me up.

55:14.080 --> 55:16.481
Yeah, it was,
um... it was a loss.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.447
That cat got one look
at your shitty life

55:19.520 --> 55:21.921
and said,
"No fucking thanks, man..."

55:22.720 --> 55:24.563
"...I am outta here!"

55:25.320 --> 55:28.005
I'm still kind of just grieving
a little bit about it.

55:29.040 --> 55:32.123
That fucking tabby is an
asshole, that's what he is.

55:32.360 --> 55:33.725
Fuck you!

55:33.920 --> 55:37.686
Yeah, "Fuck you!" That's what I
say to that cat. Goddamn it.

55:42.960 --> 55:45.486
Such a shitty,
shitty little life.

55:45.800 --> 55:47.564
You can't even keep a cat.

55:47.760 --> 55:49.444
(THUMPING)
That hurts a little bit.

55:49.640 --> 55:51.563
That's just the grief.
No, not the grief.

55:51.800 --> 55:54.246
It's just the pounding
a little bit.

55:54.880 --> 55:56.723
Oh. All right.
Don't be a dick about it.

55:56.920 --> 55:58.285
Thank you for that.

55:58.480 --> 56:00.881
All right, let's
hit the road, okay?

56:01.240 --> 56:02.730
I've got to change.

56:02.920 --> 56:04.729
What's the matter
with your pantsuit?

56:05.240 --> 56:07.004
It's pajamas.

56:07.320 --> 56:09.163
Well, excuse
the shit out of me,

56:09.240 --> 56:11.561
I didn't realize you
slept in a fucking tux.

56:11.960 --> 56:13.644
Go ahead, get your top hat.

56:22.080 --> 56:23.320
(LOCKING CAR)

56:24.720 --> 56:26.961
(PEOPLE ARGUING LOUDLY)

56:33.320 --> 56:36.722
MRS. MULLINS: This is the place where
you're supposed to be civilized!

56:37.000 --> 56:40.527
MARK: Be a mother
for once in your life.

56:41.000 --> 56:42.923
Oh, great. This asshole!

56:43.240 --> 56:45.641
Just take it easy.
Hey, Pop.

56:46.000 --> 56:47.240
Hey, pork chop.

56:47.400 --> 56:49.402
Well, well, well.
Look who it is!

56:49.600 --> 56:52.604
The rat's back in the house. Did you
come back to arrest somebody else?

56:52.800 --> 56:55.963
You know, I saw Ma throw a can of Diet
Coke in the garbage the other day.

56:56.120 --> 56:57.645
She didn't recycle it!

56:57.800 --> 57:01.043
Dad here, he's splicing cable
off the neighbors next door.

57:01.240 --> 57:02.287
Come on now, Mark.

57:02.360 --> 57:03.880
MARK: Maybe you should
fingerprint him.

57:03.920 --> 57:05.922
Maybe get yourself
some stripes!

57:06.080 --> 57:07.650
Petey here, how many songs

57:07.720 --> 57:09.768
you download illegally
off the Internet? 5,000?

57:10.040 --> 57:11.724
Ten, twenty thousand.
MARK: 20,000!

57:11.880 --> 57:13.962
Mikey just stole
a laptop from his work!

57:14.120 --> 57:16.805
Stole? I fucking worked there for six weeks.
I deserved to take it.

57:16.960 --> 57:18.962
Exactly. No health insurance.
That balances out.

57:19.160 --> 57:21.561
But not you... you'll probably
call in the SWAT team!

57:21.720 --> 57:24.007
Actually, she could, because
those are horrible examples.

57:24.160 --> 57:26.162
(SING-SONG)
Here are the nuggies!

57:26.320 --> 57:27.321
Here we go.

57:29.560 --> 57:33.645
What kind of an animal throws
her own brother in jail?

57:34.000 --> 57:36.082
This kind of animal... right here!
Shut up.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.841
How about keeps him
from killing himself?

57:37.960 --> 57:39.530
I was the only one that
got him off the street.

57:39.640 --> 57:40.801
None of you fucks did!

57:40.960 --> 57:43.361
You should never
arrest your family!

57:43.600 --> 57:45.443
Who the fuck are you?
That's Gina!

57:45.600 --> 57:47.443
Well, tell Gina I'm gonna
strangle her at the table!

57:47.600 --> 57:50.001
She is my best friend! You touch
her, you gotta go through me first.

57:50.160 --> 57:51.491
Who the fuck are you?

57:51.560 --> 57:53.761
I'll kill you, and kill her
with your fucking dead body!

57:54.120 --> 57:56.566
Everybody calm down.
Shannon's right.

57:56.720 --> 57:59.326
This one has no business
chiming in on a family matter!

57:59.480 --> 58:01.721
"This one?" Why are you talking
about my girlfriend like that?

58:01.880 --> 58:03.882
She wears sweatpants
to your mother's dinner!

58:04.080 --> 58:05.320
Those are her
classy sweatpants.

58:05.400 --> 58:06.961
They don't say
"Insert Here" on the ass.

58:07.080 --> 58:08.320
Her ass is hanging out!

58:08.400 --> 58:10.243
Look at her breasts
at the table!

58:10.320 --> 58:11.924
(INDISTINCT SHOUTING)

58:13.680 --> 58:15.045
Welcome home.

58:16.240 --> 58:17.287
You here to arrest me?

58:17.360 --> 58:18.407
I hope not.

58:19.560 --> 58:20.766
You selling Bibles?

58:20.840 --> 58:22.410
No, she's Ashburn.

58:22.760 --> 58:23.921
Let's go.

58:24.240 --> 58:25.571
We need to talk.

58:26.760 --> 58:28.091
Sit down.

58:28.520 --> 58:30.204
(ARGUING CONTINUES)

58:37.080 --> 58:38.684
(ARGUING STOPS)

58:41.600 --> 58:44.080
Uh, that is one
of the better...

58:44.920 --> 58:47.082
...Jesus sports-themed
paintings I've seen.

58:47.280 --> 58:49.601
It's very good. Nice.

58:50.120 --> 58:51.451
What are you doing
at Club Ekko?

58:51.600 --> 58:54.251
What are you, my mother?
How do you know I was there?

58:54.440 --> 58:58.047
I know everything. Are you already
working for those guys again?

58:58.200 --> 59:00.521
No, this guy Julian,
he sent for me

59:00.640 --> 59:02.290
because he wants me
to start working with him.

59:02.440 --> 59:04.966
But I told him no, I'm getting
a straight job, and it's fine.

59:05.120 --> 59:08.488
Everybody's cool now.
We parted amicably.

59:09.240 --> 59:10.969
Are you a knock?
I'm sorry?

59:11.200 --> 59:13.202
Are you a knock?
A "knock"?

59:13.600 --> 59:14.886
I'm sorry, I don't
know what that is.

59:14.960 --> 59:16.291
GINA: A knock.

59:16.600 --> 59:18.090
Am I speaking fucking Japanese?

59:18.200 --> 59:19.281
Yeah, listen to him.

59:19.480 --> 59:20.891
MICHAEL: I'll sound it out for you.

59:21.160 --> 59:22.810
(ENUNCIATING) Are you...
(MOUTHING ALONG)

59:23.160 --> 59:25.162
...or are you not...

59:26.320 --> 59:28.163
...a knock?
A fucking knock!

59:28.760 --> 59:30.250
Like Johnny Depp
in <i>21 Jump Street.</i>

59:30.320 --> 59:32.607
Ah, I see! Okay, a narc.

59:32.960 --> 59:35.327
A knock, yes!
What was I saying?

59:35.480 --> 59:39.121
I was missing the R.I heard
"knock", but apparently there's a C.

59:39.280 --> 59:40.327
He said knock!

59:40.400 --> 59:41.811
I said fucking knock, right?

59:41.960 --> 59:44.327
Why are you wearing a long-sleeved flannel?
It's hot out.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.006
(STAMMERING) I'm a little fluey.
It's nothing.

59:47.200 --> 59:49.362
You want me to break that thumb?
Please, don't! No!

59:49.560 --> 59:50.846
Mercy. Mercy. Mercy.

59:51.120 --> 59:52.485
MULLINS: Straighten that arm.

59:52.800 --> 59:56.122
It looks worse than it is. It's not a big deal.
This guy Julian...

59:56.320 --> 59:57.970
...wants me to keep working.
They like me.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.770
Tell me where I can
find Julian right now.

59:59.840 --> 01:00:00.966
No. Just stay out of it.

01:00:01.120 --> 01:00:04.203
They're maniacs. They'll chop you
up, or gun you down, or worse.

01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:06.323
Jason, tell me
what you fucking know!

01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.481
I don't know anything.

01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:09.406
(SCREAMS)

01:00:10.520 --> 01:00:12.522
Okay. Sal Natale.

01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:15.162
Okay?
You know Sal Natale?

01:00:15.480 --> 01:00:16.527
Of course I do.

01:00:16.680 --> 01:00:18.444
He was gonna steal
this huge shipment

01:00:18.520 --> 01:00:20.249
they got coming in,
so they popped him.

01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:23.051
He's in the trunk of his Caddy
under the Charles River Bridge.

01:00:23.200 --> 01:00:24.281
I want you to stay
in this house.

01:00:24.360 --> 01:00:26.886
If I catch you outside, I'll
hurt you worse than them.

01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.690
PETER: What are you?
Why are you here?

01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:31.002
I'm a federal agent.
I'm a Special Agent.

01:00:31.200 --> 01:00:32.531
Special, like retarded?

01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:35.407
We don't use that word.
We say "special needs".

01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:38.171
But I have a very high IQ.

01:00:38.440 --> 01:00:39.930
Are you a boy or a girl?

01:00:40.240 --> 01:00:41.571
That's a fair question.

01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:43.250
Uh, I'm... I'm female.

01:00:43.680 --> 01:00:44.681
No kidding.

01:00:44.840 --> 01:00:46.046
All woman!

01:00:46.280 --> 01:00:48.442
From the get-go?
No operation?

01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:49.766
Um...

01:00:49.840 --> 01:00:51.080
(CAR UNLOCKS) From birth, yes.

01:00:51.240 --> 01:00:53.360
How you get that close a shave
on your face? (HONKING)

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.561
I need to go, but I'll be back to, um...
(CAR STARTING)

01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:57.563
PETER: Nice knowing you.
Yeah, thank you.

01:00:57.960 --> 01:00:59.928
MULLINS: Yep, that's
Sal Natale, all right.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.567
Bullet hole through the head. That's
unusually civilized for them.

01:01:03.880 --> 01:01:05.564
Oh, they cut out his tongue, too.
Ah.

01:01:05.800 --> 01:01:08.406
There you have it. They
like to send a message.

01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:10.444
Did you find the tongue? Sure.

01:01:10.560 --> 01:01:12.244
Shoved it up his anal cavity.

01:01:12.480 --> 01:01:14.130
That's a weird message.

01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.360
The tip of the tongue was
sticking out of the rectum.

01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.130
So it made it appear
as if his buttocks

01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:19.804
were giving the police
the raspberry.

01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:22.765
Did they draw googly eyes or
anything on his butt cheeks?

01:01:22.920 --> 01:01:23.921
No.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:28.445
Seems like kind of an opportunity missed.
That would have been funny.

01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:32.924
Well, I feel that they were just
trying to be tongue in cheek.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:37.209
God, don't do that.

01:01:38.120 --> 01:01:40.202
(CLEARS THROAT)
Where are his belongings?

01:01:42.200 --> 01:01:44.282
Any clues as to where
the body was killed?

01:01:44.360 --> 01:01:46.442
We're still looking
for their base camp.

01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:48.489
Well, if there's
anything on him

01:01:48.600 --> 01:01:50.284
that will tell us,
I will find it.

01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:57.040
ASHBURN: Huh.
MULLINS: Is that coke?

01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:59.641
I don't think so.
It's more like a coating.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.121
Same traces found
on all the victims' shoes.

01:02:02.320 --> 01:02:03.810
All of them had...
Epoxy powder coating.

01:02:03.880 --> 01:02:04.881
Right?

01:02:05.040 --> 01:02:06.041
That's right.

01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:09.804
Each sample was made of the same ingredient.
Which means...

01:02:10.080 --> 01:02:11.491
They were all
killed same place.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:12.641
Exactly.

01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:14.085
I checked it out Wow.

01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:16.163
There are three places that
have this kind of powder.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.322
Paint factory!
Yeah.

01:02:18.720 --> 01:02:20.404
We all know that.
Well, it's...

01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:22.085
Look at this.

01:02:23.400 --> 01:02:25.402
This one right here is
centered in the location...

01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:28.086
Where all four dead
bodies were found!

01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.323
Right.
That's what I thought.

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.891
This one shut down years ago,

01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.291
owned by a man by
the name of Lief Sa...

01:02:33.440 --> 01:02:34.930
Sambertineson?
Sagglemint?

01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:37.446
Samber...?
Old Sagglemint.

01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:38.761
Santino.

01:02:38.920 --> 01:02:40.922
Oh, Santino!
Santino... Santino.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.444
Is that a derivative
of Sagglemint?

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:45.762
Get me the address
to that paint factory ASAP.

01:02:45.920 --> 01:02:47.365
Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...

01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:49.091
I was wondering...

01:02:49.360 --> 01:02:50.850
(MUTTERS SOFTLY) Oh. This
is a little awkward.

01:02:51.120 --> 01:02:53.600
Uh, it's nothing personal, but
as a rule I make it a point...

01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.206
...not to date my
co-workers, so... thank you.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:59.204
I was wondering if you would
not talk to me in that tone.

01:02:59.840 --> 01:03:01.968
Oh! Yes, of course!

01:03:02.200 --> 01:03:03.884
That's a little different.

01:03:04.040 --> 01:03:05.451
I wouldn't.
Why would I?

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:07.050
Why would you? Really.

01:03:07.360 --> 01:03:09.124
We should go to
the paint factory.

01:03:09.280 --> 01:03:12.284
Are we clear here? Because
it got real awkward.

01:03:12.440 --> 01:03:14.568
No... I think we're all good.
Right?

01:03:14.880 --> 01:03:16.370
Uh... ASHBURN: We're really good.

01:03:16.440 --> 01:03:17.487
Same page.

01:03:17.640 --> 01:03:18.880
Because I don't want any bad...

01:03:18.920 --> 01:03:20.126
ASHBURN: We're all good.
Here we go.

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:21.805
Let's go to the paint factory.

01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.406
She doesn't want to date
co-workers, so spread the word.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.641
Shut up.

01:03:25.960 --> 01:03:29.043
<i>Caught my man cheating Now I'm
rolling through the west side</i>

01:03:29.120 --> 01:03:31.771
<i>'Bout to burn this fucking
house down like I'm Left Eye</i>

01:03:31.840 --> 01:03:32.807
<i>Rest in peace</i>

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.211
<i>Like I'm Left Eye Rest in peace</i>

01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:35.486
<i>Like I'm Left Eye</i>

01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:38.530
<i>'Bout to burn this motherfucker
down like I'm Left Eye</i>

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:41.968
<i>Heard my man is cheating with
another bitch at my house</i>

01:03:56.720 --> 01:03:58.210
What is that shit?

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.601
Stop it.

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.081
(WHISPERING) Just cover
me and go right.

01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.525
Well, then say that.

01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.728
You make me want to shoot you.

01:04:08.680 --> 01:04:10.682
JULIAN: I don't know what your
problem is, but we told you...

01:04:10.760 --> 01:04:12.683
stay out of the city.

01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:17.648
I don't know what it is. Are you deaf?
Do you not speak English?

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.443
I got to do something
with you, man.

01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.282
Look, Julian...
I'm sorry.

01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:25.602
I'll sell for you guys.
Whatever you want me to do.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:27.681
I'm just trying to
make some extra money.

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:29.643
You can't blame
me for that, right?

01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:31.962
Relax.
I totally get it.

01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.122
Thank you. I'm not
gonna shoot you.

01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:36.282
Okay. It's cool, man. Thanks.

01:04:36.440 --> 01:04:38.283
He is.
Wait! Hold on!

01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:40.326
(SIGHS) (WHISPERING) Shit!

01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:43.211
(WHISPERING) If we grab Julian,
I can get into his head.

01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:44.486
We'll have Larkin by tonight.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:46.085
Two against two.
I like those odds.

01:04:46.160 --> 01:04:47.400
I'll call for backup.

01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:49.285
(WHISPERING) It's already here.

01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:51.765
Oh, hey!

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:55.209
I was looking for you. Um, I
forgot to get your number.

01:04:55.360 --> 01:04:58.682
Cool. It's, uh,
1-800-GiveMeYourFuckingGuns.

01:04:59.560 --> 01:05:03.167
That's, uh...
too many numbers.

01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:07.122
I met these disasters at
the club the other night.

01:05:07.440 --> 01:05:09.124
Now they're both here.

01:05:09.320 --> 01:05:10.760
You think you
might have been bugged?

01:05:11.320 --> 01:05:12.651
Give me a break.

01:05:15.400 --> 01:05:16.765
What the fuck?

01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.769
Think you're hot shit?
Guess what.

01:05:22.840 --> 01:05:24.569
You guys look even
older in this lighting!

01:05:24.920 --> 01:05:26.251
Come on.
Fuck you.

01:05:26.440 --> 01:05:29.683
Fuck you! It's not fuck me.
It's fuck you.

01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:33.248
You know why? Because I'm
about to fuck you up.

01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:37.801
Pick it up.

01:05:39.360 --> 01:05:41.840
Do it. Give me a reason
to shoot you in the face.

01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:48.481
How long will this take?

01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:50.290
Maybe 12 hours, hopefully less.

01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:51.964
I have to find out
what drives him.

01:05:52.120 --> 01:05:53.884
We could just beat him
with a phonebook.

01:05:54.040 --> 01:05:55.804
No! For so many
reasons, no.

01:05:55.960 --> 01:05:57.325
You just need to be
patient, all right?

01:05:57.400 --> 01:06:00.449
It is crucial that
you remain patient.

01:06:00.720 --> 01:06:03.200
It's also crucial that you stop
wearing this stupid barrette.

01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:05.044
Don't! Just leave it.

01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:07.168
Why? You have one on your head.

01:06:07.240 --> 01:06:09.208
Yeah, on top of my head,
like a normal person.

01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:11.402
What is the difference?
Just move on.

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:14.285
If you enter that room, you could
break the bond we have created.

01:06:14.440 --> 01:06:16.920
Okay? Just please, please
trust me on this one.

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:18.923
Do you understand
how important this is?

01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.365
Yeah, I do.

01:06:21.720 --> 01:06:23.245
And you will be patient?

01:06:23.880 --> 01:06:24.881
I will.

01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.365
Okay. All right.

01:06:31.720 --> 01:06:32.721
Hello.

01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.121
Coffee?

01:06:35.280 --> 01:06:38.124
I drink a little more coffee
than I probably should.

01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:40.681
Where's Larkin?

01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.489
You couldn't wait ten seconds?

01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:43.961
What's so funny?

01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.202
You... thinking you're
going to make me talk.

01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.448
You're talking
right now, dumb-ass!

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.360
You look like one of
the Campbell's soup kids

01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.084
who grew up and
became an alcoholic.

01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.449
Oh, surprisingly catty.
You're a fucking genius.

01:06:55.760 --> 01:06:57.762
(WHISPERING) I asked
you to stay outside!

01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:59.006
(WHISPERING) I need to
go tough on him.

01:06:59.200 --> 01:07:00.531
Are you not already doing that?

01:07:00.640 --> 01:07:02.005
No! I'm doing
good cop, bad cop.

01:07:02.200 --> 01:07:03.361
You know, I can hear you.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:04.521
Shut up!

01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:06.881
(SIGHS)

01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.321
Just please,
don't do anything crazy.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:11.164
I won't do anything crazy.

01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.808
What am I gonna do that's crazy?
I'm a police officer. Huh?

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.490
(GUN CLICKS) Am I gonna
shoot you in the dick?

01:07:16.640 --> 01:07:19.484
You said nothing crazy,
and that is a no-no!

01:07:19.560 --> 01:07:20.561
No-no!

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.409
Turn around. I need you
to pass a polygraph.

01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:24.250
Put it away!
Turn around!

01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:26.846
Don't worry, she won't do it.
She won't do anything.

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:30.243
So you want to gamble with your
scrotum and your testicles?

01:07:30.320 --> 01:07:31.606
Okay, gamble away!

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:32.801
Just go to the corner!

01:07:32.880 --> 01:07:33.881
I'm in it!

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.686
I'll tell you what we're gonna do...
play a little game.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.330
I'm gonna take
out these bullets.

01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:41.167
Except this one. Because
this is my favorite.

01:07:41.320 --> 01:07:42.480
I'm gonna keep that in there.

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:44.409
And then you're gonna
tell me where Larkin is.

01:07:44.680 --> 01:07:46.603
And you're gonna
tell me when and where

01:07:46.680 --> 01:07:48.682
that shipment is coming in.
Okay?

01:07:49.480 --> 01:07:50.641
Right now.

01:07:52.480 --> 01:07:54.448
I'm gonna kill you
and everyone you know.

01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.681
(GUN CLICKS)
(EXCLAIMS)

01:07:55.800 --> 01:07:57.529
That's not what I asked.

01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:59.569
Straight arrow,
take the gun from her!

01:07:59.640 --> 01:08:00.721
Now you want me to
save your scrotum?

01:08:00.880 --> 01:08:02.640

I don't know.

(GUN CLICKS) Ah!

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:06.201
All right! There's a
shipment on Wednesday!

01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:07.885
Where?
I don't know!

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.411
(GUN CLICKS) I swear
to God, I don't know!

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:11.284

her where it is!

Don't shoot me in the dick!

01:08:13.160 --> 01:08:15.242
I don't know! It's gonna be Wednesday!
That's four shots!

01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.169
Don't take any more shots!

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:18.964

where it's coming in!

shoot me in the dick!

(GUN CLICKS)
Enough! Stop it!

01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.484
You brought
Julian and LeSoire in?

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.483
You out of your minds?
Wasn't too smart.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.404
Oh. So you're not supposed
to arrest someone

01:08:28.479 --> 01:08:30.528
when they commit murder
and try and kill you?

01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.162
You wanted us to
keep them on the street?

01:08:33.359 --> 01:08:35.362
You shouldn't
even have been there!

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.522
Larkin is the big catch,
not those two!

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.363
Now we're never
gonna be able to...

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:41.124
Craig! Calm down!
We can all hear you.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:42.691
Yeah, dogs can hear you.

01:08:42.800 --> 01:08:44.211
Of course dogs can hear me!

01:08:44.439 --> 01:08:47.205
Are you okay? Because
you look really pale.

01:08:47.359 --> 01:08:48.885
It's a genetic condition!

01:08:49.120 --> 01:08:50.121

01:08:52.040 --> 01:08:55.647
CRAIG: Oh, I get it! That's a good
one because I'm really white!

01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.606
Can I have a moment
with my agent, please?

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:01.841
(SOFTLY) I'm good.

01:09:02.800 --> 01:09:04.962
All right. I'm gonna
be right over there.

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:07.165
Right there.

01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:08.640
Thank you.

01:09:08.800 --> 01:09:10.564
Why didn't you alert anyone

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.520
once you found evidence
of Julian's whereabouts?

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.243
It was an unconfirmed lead.

01:09:14.319 --> 01:09:16.402
I wasn't gonna waste anyone's
time until I knew it was real.

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.006
Give it a rest. I want
you to stand down...

01:09:19.160 --> 01:09:21.925
...while I figure out how to
repair all this shit with the DEA.

01:09:22.080 --> 01:09:24.207
Sir, no, please.
I swear I've been doing

01:09:24.279 --> 01:09:25.566
everything you sent
me out here to do.

01:09:25.760 --> 01:09:27.046
We've been doing
such good work.

01:09:27.120 --> 01:09:29.087
I know you are.

01:09:29.319 --> 01:09:30.401
It's just...

01:09:31.279 --> 01:09:34.648
I don't know, it's... never
easy when you are involved.

01:09:43.439 --> 01:09:44.770
Fuck that guy.

01:09:45.600 --> 01:09:47.640
If you're not in trouble,
you're not doing your job.

01:09:47.960 --> 01:09:48.961
Yeah.

01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:51.929
We should go get a drink. Right?

01:09:52.279 --> 01:09:53.611
What's the point of being a cop

01:09:53.680 --> 01:09:55.091
if you can't get one drink
at the end of the night?

01:09:55.440 --> 01:09:56.680
That's what I'm talking about!

01:09:56.800 --> 01:09:58.131
I said I just want one.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:00.403
Oh, no, no, here...
it is one.

01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:02.847
Sometimes he just likes
to do this thing where...

01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:06.681
...he pours them in three
little glasses, but it's one.

01:10:07.240 --> 01:10:09.641
All right, here we go!

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:11.651

Okey-dokey.

01:10:18.720 --> 01:10:19.801
There you go.

01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.002
There you go. Keep a pace.
(MUFFLED) Okay.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:24.003
Don't spit that shit out.
It's not free.

01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.366
Let's go.

01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:27.011
Keep that in.

01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:28.727
Ooh.

01:10:28.800 --> 01:10:32.168
Hey, how you doing?
I haven't heard from you.

01:10:32.480 --> 01:10:33.811
Shit.

01:10:34.480 --> 01:10:36.323
No, you haven't.

01:10:36.640 --> 01:10:39.007
Well, did I do
something wrong, or...

(SIGHS DEEPLY)

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.767
Okay, here we go.

01:10:44.160 --> 01:10:45.764
It's not you, it's me.

01:10:46.760 --> 01:10:48.762
Uh, I'm still
working on myself.

01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:51.844
So I can't be a part of two
until I'm a better one.

01:10:52.080 --> 01:10:53.411
You don't have to do that.

01:10:53.480 --> 01:10:54.766
Oh, wait.
My favorite's coming.

01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.081
Oh.

01:10:56.160 --> 01:10:58.527
You make me want to
be a better woman.

01:10:58.840 --> 01:11:00.251
I thought we had a good time.

01:11:00.520 --> 01:11:05.003
We did have a lot of fun.
And now we're gonna move on.

01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:06.850
Let it go.

01:11:07.840 --> 01:11:09.365
All right. Cool.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.523
No hard feelings, right?

01:11:21.040 --> 01:11:23.042
Okay, hit it.
Hit it.

01:11:26.080 --> 01:11:27.127
Bye.

01:11:28.120 --> 01:11:30.964
I didn't know how else to say it.
It's pretty clear.

01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:33.290
That's why you
don't feed strays.

01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:36.131
Can we get two more...

01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.966
...shots?

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.361
(MOUTHING) Six.

01:11:41.880 --> 01:11:44.042

few more of these, right?

01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:48.684
ASHBURN: I don't know, Mullins.
It's hard.

01:11:49.320 --> 01:11:50.810
I know we're not
supposed to say this,

01:11:50.880 --> 01:11:53.326
but being a woman
in this field is hard.

01:11:53.960 --> 01:11:57.726
Men are just so intimidated
by me, which is like... why?

01:11:58.320 --> 01:12:02.166
And then you put your personality
on top of that and it is...

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:03.965
...it is off-putting.

01:12:04.200 --> 01:12:07.522
You know, I was actually
married for six some years.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.450
Was he a hearing man?
Yes.

01:12:09.800 --> 01:12:13.043
He didn't understand how
much the job meant to me,

01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:14.804
so I thought it'd
be best to just...

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:17.765
...be alone rather than
to compromise the work.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:19.331
I get that.

01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:24.086
It's kind of weird that it does
get lonely... a little bit.

01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:27.607
It's hard to
make female friends.

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.842
I hung out, you know...

01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:33.527
...really just with my brothers
and stuff growing up and...

01:12:33.760 --> 01:12:36.525
...they just all turned out
to be terrible people.

01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:37.761
So that's kind of a bummer.

01:12:38.040 --> 01:12:40.042
Your family loves you.

01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.206
I mean,
in their own unique way,

01:12:43.280 --> 01:12:45.203
but they love you and
that's a wonderful...

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:46.361
Very unique.

01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:47.931

it's coming from

(CHUCKLES) somebody
that's an only child.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:52.804
No, I was actually raised
with a lot of children.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:55.162
Other children?
What, in a circus?

01:12:55.440 --> 01:12:57.283
No, just in...
in the houses.

Oh, my God.

01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.684
You're a foster kid.

01:13:03.640 --> 01:13:04.801
Yes, I was.

Oh, my God.

01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.442
No. Jesus, that clears up a lot.

01:13:08.520 --> 01:13:11.364
Foster kid. That makes sense.
That's a tough go of it.

01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:13.847
No, it was totally fine.

01:13:13.920 --> 01:13:17.720
There was a lot of benefits
to being a foster kid.

01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:19.529
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:22.683
On Christmases, there was
this local drugstore

01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:28.244
that would sponsor us and give us
little baggies of toiletries and stuff.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:34.327
On Thanksgiving, we would hit these
different putt putt golf courses.

01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:37.411
You'd meet all kinds of...
Other sad kids?

01:13:37.480 --> 01:13:39.403
No...
Oh, Jesus.

01:13:41.160 --> 01:13:44.004
That's the saddest series
of images I've ever heard.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:48.369
I don't think it affected me in
the long run at all. At all.

01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:49.441
You're probably fine.

01:13:49.520 --> 01:13:53.809
I can see how maybe it was, like, a
little bit, but not anything that's...

01:13:54.120 --> 01:13:56.202
Maybe it has?
Oh, God.

01:13:56.600 --> 01:13:58.204

cigarettes last night?

01:23:41.480 --> 01:23:42.970
we would have
Larkin and Julian.

01:23:43.160 --> 01:23:45.322
They would both be there,
and we could get them.

is out of there for now.

01:23:48.560 --> 01:23:49.561

01:23:50.560 --> 01:23:51.607
Shame, though.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.251
Having your brother on the

That's what you want to say?

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:56.766
Because you're
saying that out loud.

01:23:56.920 --> 01:23:59.924

thing if it wasn't your brother.

We're done talking about this.

So if it was just
some random drug dealer,

01:24:03.320 --> 01:24:04.520
you wouldn't send him back in?

if we don't catch Larkin.

there and gets killed.

to get involved with drugs.

You're an asshole for that.

01:24:27.120 --> 01:24:28.849
Okay, that's not
helping, either.

Oh, I feel like
you're an asshole.

01:33:23.840 --> 01:33:25.524
That officer right there...

01:33:25.840 --> 01:33:29.686
...is a better law enforcement
officer than anybody in this room.

01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.362
Myself included. She is better than
you, she is better than you...

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:35.522
...and she is definitely
better than you.

01:33:35.680 --> 01:33:38.684
What are you doing? Are you texting?
Playing a game?

01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:41.770
What is it? Put it away!
God, you guys!

01:33:42.040 --> 01:33:45.726
What is the matter with you?
You're just such jerks!

01:33:46.360 --> 01:33:48.044
You're just such...

01:33:48.240 --> 01:33:53.246
You're just a shit-jerk! You're
just a shit-jerk dick... fucker!

01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.564
You're a shit-jerk
dick-fucker assholer!

01:33:56.760 --> 01:33:59.445
And you just go
fuck yourselves!

01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:02.281
Sorry, <i>señor,</i> not you.
Pardon, please.

01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:04.921
Just... all you fuckers!

01:34:06.400 --> 01:34:07.845
(RUBBING GLASS)

01:34:15.080 --> 01:34:16.241
Get on the ground!

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:17.441
You are under arrest!

01:34:17.560 --> 01:34:20.723
Put your hands up and tell me where
the fuck Larkin is! (COCKING GUN)

01:34:21.320 --> 01:34:24.927
I think it'd be much more better
if you put your hands up.

01:34:25.560 --> 01:34:27.403
ASHBURN: "Much more better?"

01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.927
Drop the gun and take a
grammar course, you idiot.

01:34:30.120 --> 01:34:31.645
Who the fuck are you?

01:34:31.960 --> 01:34:33.291
Me and her...

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:36.604
...we're the fucking heat.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:42.482
All right... we've got some
scumbags to visit, huh?

01:34:42.800 --> 01:34:44.768
Yeah, we do.
Get up, asshole!

01:34:44.960 --> 01:34:45.961
Let's go.

01:34:49.520 --> 01:34:50.567
Where's Larkin?

01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:51.926
I don't even know who that is.

01:34:52.120 --> 01:34:53.201
Where is he?

01:34:53.280 --> 01:34:54.601
I don't know who
the fuck that is!

01:34:54.760 --> 01:34:56.444
ASHBURN: Really? It's clean?

01:34:56.960 --> 01:34:58.644
You not finding anything?

01:34:58.960 --> 01:35:00.450
Nothing in here?
(PANTING)

01:35:00.600 --> 01:35:03.444
Okay, hold on a second.
How about this? Right there!

01:35:03.640 --> 01:35:05.165
Right there!
(WHIMPERS)

01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:07.688
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
MULLINS: Got your pizza!

01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:09.850
Got your pizza, mister!

01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:12.645
Fresh hot pizza!

01:35:12.800 --> 01:35:14.962
ASHBURN: Get on your knees!
Where's your stash?

01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:16.281
I don't have anything yet.

01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.964
I'm waiting to get some
from a new distributor.

01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:19.804
Who's your new distributor?

01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.963
(SIGHING) Oh, shit, man!

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:27.651
Guess who.

01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.002
Surprise.
Come on, man!

01:35:30.240 --> 01:35:32.891
I don't know what y'all are doing here!
I'm out of the game.

01:35:33.080 --> 01:35:35.560
You know what I hate? Drugs.
I'm a different man!

01:35:37.800 --> 01:35:39.086
This is not mine.

01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.650
I just bought that
refrigerator the other day.

01:35:40.880 --> 01:35:42.644
This must have been in there.

01:35:44.320 --> 01:35:46.049
We want to know
where all this new shit

01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:47.770
is coming from.
Where is Larkin?

01:35:47.920 --> 01:35:51.925
Bitch, what part of "I'm out"
do you not understand? I'm out!

01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:55.331
You want to interview him?

01:35:55.880 --> 01:35:59.327
No. No. I think I have
something better in mind.

01:36:00.280 --> 01:36:01.281
(SCREAMING)

01:36:01.400 --> 01:36:04.051
Oh, shit! I don't know shit!
Come on!

01:36:04.360 --> 01:36:06.840
MULLINS: I don't know, you're
getting awfully heavy, Rojas.

01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:08.047
Yeah, lie to me again.

01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:10.480
I want to feel your body sliding
through my delicate hands.

01:36:10.600 --> 01:36:11.601
I don't know shit!

01:36:11.840 --> 01:36:13.410
Whoa, I can't hold you!

01:36:13.480 --> 01:36:14.680
ROJAS: No,
I don't want to die!

01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:16.051
I don't want to die!

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.965
Okay! It's at a warehouse!
On Summer Street!

01:36:19.240 --> 01:36:21.242
I'm almost disappointed.
Get me up!

01:36:21.400 --> 01:36:22.606
Let's pull him up.

01:36:22.680 --> 01:36:25.081
No, I'm not kidding.
I can't lift him up.

01:36:25.360 --> 01:36:26.600
I can't lift him!

01:36:26.680 --> 01:36:28.125
I've only done this
one other time

01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:29.565
and it was
a really tiny hooker.

01:36:29.800 --> 01:36:31.040
Lift my ass up!

01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:32.770
You ain't putting
nobody over no rails

01:36:32.840 --> 01:36:34.285
you can't fucking
lift them out!

01:36:34.520 --> 01:36:35.885
Okay, okay!

01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.925
Uh... Just tuck your head
and relax your body.

01:36:40.120 --> 01:36:41.485
Lady, what the fuck?

01:36:42.080 --> 01:36:44.082
Crap! Crap!
Get me up!

01:36:44.280 --> 01:36:45.645
(SCREAMING)

01:36:47.400 --> 01:36:48.970
(BOTH SIGH WITH RELIEF)

01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.721
Thank you again!
Thank you!

01:36:53.720 --> 01:36:55.882
That was on me.
I take that.

01:36:56.240 --> 01:36:58.720
I hope this ain't my car.
This is my car?

01:37:00.120 --> 01:37:03.090
On, shit! My 2003!

01:37:04.720 --> 01:37:05.926
Let's load up.

01:37:06.280 --> 01:37:07.964

You said that thing ticks.

01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.206
But not for days.

You hungry? I got a
sandwich I didn't finish.

01:37:32.280 --> 01:37:34.760
Is that the same sandwich
you offered me a week ago?

01:37:35.280 --> 01:37:37.487
It's cheese.
Cheese doesn't go bad.

01:38:37.480 --> 01:38:38.686
Unfortunate.

every time I see you.

Put the fucking guns down.
No, thanks.

01:38:43.400 --> 01:38:45.243
Nice entrance, Teen Wolf.

01:38:45.400 --> 01:38:47.448
You look like a Ninja Turtle.
Take it easy.

01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.647

01:38:48.720 --> 01:38:50.006
for 72 hours before.
Let's go.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:51.491
We need to do what he says.

01:38:51.560 --> 01:38:52.607
What?

01:38:52.760 --> 01:38:53.807
It's the best thing.

01:38:53.880 --> 01:38:56.406
We gonna shoot our way out of this?
Put the gun in the bag.

01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:58.404
No, hold your gun up.

01:38:58.560 --> 01:39:00.562
Give them the bag,
give them everything!

Goddamn you. I thought
you had my back.

01:39:03.720 --> 01:39:05.722
Put it in the bag
and slide it over, now.

It's in the bag!

01:39:07.440 --> 01:39:08.771
Slide the bag over!

01:39:08.960 --> 01:39:09.961
Sorry.

01:39:10.880 --> 01:39:12.848
I guess you and her
are engaged now, huh?

01:39:12.920 --> 01:39:13.921
What?

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:15.405
Well, because...

01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.887
...you just gave me
a ring, motherfucker!

How funny.

01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:53.006
This is like when you were interrogating
me, only now you're tied up...

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:55.163
...and I've got
all these knives.

01:39:57.320 --> 01:39:59.846
You know, I don't
like to shoot people.

01:40:00.080 --> 01:40:01.923
I like cutting people up.

01:40:02.440 --> 01:40:04.124
It's kind of what I do.

01:40:05.920 --> 01:40:07.809
I like that one.

01:40:07.960 --> 01:40:09.880
That's a good small one.
Good choice, it's small.

01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:11.406
You like this?

01:40:11.600 --> 01:40:12.761
Not too flashy.

01:40:13.120 --> 01:40:15.726
This is actually
an oyster shucking knife.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.287
Either of you ladies
need your oyster shucked?

01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:22.284
Not at the moment.
Not me.

01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:24.887
I got to tell you,
I've done this

01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:27.361
a lot of times
to a lot of people...

01:40:28.040 --> 01:40:31.044
...but you two, you're
gonna be the most fun.

(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING) What?

01:40:33.040 --> 01:40:34.530
Larkin's here.

01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:36.690
Larkin.
Upstairs.

01:40:41.600 --> 01:40:44.206
This fun will have to wait.
The boss is here.

01:40:44.880 --> 01:40:47.724
Can you please excuse
me a second, ladies?

01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.885
Sure, take what time you need.
Yeah, take your time.

01:40:51.040 --> 01:40:52.565
Okay, cool.

01:40:52.960 --> 01:40:54.644
Oh, also, um...

01:40:55.280 --> 01:40:57.123
...would you mind
holding this for me?

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:59.806
Well, my hands are tied,
but I can certainly try.

01:40:59.960 --> 01:41:01.644
Okay, let me help you.

01:41:01.880 --> 01:41:03.644

(BLOWING) Yeah, do that.

01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.411
Do that, do that.

Breathe it out, breathe it out.

01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:16.841
Okay, Mullins.

01:41:18.560 --> 01:41:19.925
If we should perish...

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:22.048
We're not gonna.
Just shh!

01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:24.846
I know I'm not very
good with my feelings...

01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:26.809
...but I need to
tell you something.

01:41:27.160 --> 01:41:29.128
You are smart.

01:41:29.440 --> 01:41:31.522
You are smart and
you are intuitive.

01:41:31.800 --> 01:41:34.007
And you're the best cop
I've ever worked with.

01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:36.645
You, too, thank you.

01:41:36.840 --> 01:41:39.366
You were right. I went back and
looked at the evidence and...

01:41:39.520 --> 01:41:41.841
...I think the Red Falls
Killer is innocent.

01:41:41.960 --> 01:41:43.086
(CURSING SOFTLY)

01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:45.043
Did you happen to
mention that to anybody

01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:46.964
before you put yourself in a
life-threatening situation?

01:41:47.160 --> 01:41:48.366
No, I didn't!

01:41:48.720 --> 01:41:51.724
Jesus! Good luck... you're taking
that to your grave probably.

01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.321
Fuck, the other leg!
Fuck, the other leg!

01:41:56.160 --> 01:41:57.889
You can move your chair,
too, you know.

01:41:57.960 --> 01:42:00.008
I am moving my chair.

01:42:00.520 --> 01:42:03.000
Just grab the knife.
Take it!

01:42:03.160 --> 01:42:04.844
Just take it!

01:42:05.880 --> 01:42:06.881
MULLINS: I'm sorry.

01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:09.327
(SCREAMS)
I got it! Shit!

01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:11.882
Shut up.
Shut up. Shut up.

01:42:12.240 --> 01:42:13.526
Just come on, all right?

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:15.045
I am doing it as fast as I can.

01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:16.611
It's almost there.

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.166
Got it!

01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:20.446
Hurry up, hurry up.

01:42:20.680 --> 01:42:21.841
(DOOR SLAMS) Hurry up.

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:24.005
What?
Somebody's coming up.

01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:25.890
Got to put it back in. What?

01:42:26.080 --> 01:42:27.411
I got to put it back in.

01:42:27.520 --> 01:42:28.965
And I'll put my hands
behind my back.

01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:30.485
When he gets close,
I'll grab him.

01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:32.404
But you got to shut up
and let me put it back in.

01:42:32.560 --> 01:42:33.800
Okay, just put it in.

01:42:34.240 --> 01:42:35.401
What are you doing?

01:42:35.520 --> 01:42:37.010
Sorry, it doesn't
go in that easy.

01:42:37.160 --> 01:42:38.321
Just shut up!

01:42:38.480 --> 01:42:40.084
(YELPS) Motherfucker!
(GAGGING)

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:42.688
I'm sorry. Oh, shit.

01:42:43.160 --> 01:42:45.640
I'll pretend to
keep my hands tied.

01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:47.570
Shut up, shut up.

01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:52.682
Oh, no, Scoob! Velma and
Daphne got captured!

01:42:52.840 --> 01:42:55.241
(SIGHS) I never thought I'd
be happy to see you guys.

01:42:55.400 --> 01:42:57.004
We got to get her
to the hospital.

01:42:57.200 --> 01:42:58.326
Did you guys call this in?

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:00.044
Yeah, I sent a fucking
owl with a note.

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.526
How did you even
know we were here?

01:43:01.600 --> 01:43:02.761
We followed you.

01:43:02.920 --> 01:43:04.365
I knew you wouldn't
give up easily,

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.283
especially not after they
greased your shitbag brother.

01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:09.882
Fuck you. It takes a lot more than
Larkin to take down a Mullins.

01:43:10.120 --> 01:43:11.610
Jason's not dead?

01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.524
Come on, Adam.
Larkin is on his way.

01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.682
What is this, a Q and A?
Can we do this later?

01:43:15.840 --> 01:43:18.207
Wait. Did he talk to the police?
Did he see Larkin?

01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.886
How is she supposed to know? He's
been in a coma. Untie my leg.

01:43:21.120 --> 01:43:23.805
That's too bad. Where is he?
Is he at Boston General?

01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:24.961
Why? You gonna send
him fucking flowers?

01:43:25.240 --> 01:43:26.321
ASHBURN: Why are you so...?

01:43:27.120 --> 01:43:28.406
Oh, my God.

01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:29.806
You piece of shit.

01:43:30.120 --> 01:43:32.122
You guys are
working with Larkin.

01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:33.721
I really wish you
hadn't said that.

01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:34.807
Said What?

01:43:36.280 --> 01:43:38.123
Oh, God!
Shit!

01:43:38.280 --> 01:43:39.805
That felt good! (CHUCKLES)

01:43:39.960 --> 01:43:42.645
It wasn't the albino.
I feel bad.

01:43:42.840 --> 01:43:44.604
He wasn't working for Larkin.

01:43:44.680 --> 01:43:46.170
He just wanted you off the case

01:43:46.280 --> 01:43:47.691
'cause he's
a misogynistic asshole.

01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:50.924
Why are you doing this? You
getting some kind of payoff?

01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:52.610
I was in the beginning.

01:43:52.840 --> 01:43:54.729
Six years dealing
with these lowlifes,

01:43:54.800 --> 01:43:56.450
making shit money...
Ah!

01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:59.081
You're Larkin.

01:43:59.400 --> 01:44:00.401
Holy shit.

01:44:00.680 --> 01:44:01.727
Ta-da!

01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:04.485
Get it? Right?
Makes perfect sense!

01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:08.885
Now I'm bragging, but it's very
nice having a second income.

01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:10.884
I heard shots.
What the...?

01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:13.647
Aw, the albino.
That guy was hilarious!

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.202
Boss, I don't think that
was such a good idea.

01:44:16.400 --> 01:44:18.801
You spend three years in a van
with him, you'd kill him, too.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:20.525
We'll pin it on LeSoire.

01:44:21.280 --> 01:44:23.567
I've got to go to the
hospital to finish Jason.

01:44:23.760 --> 01:44:26.604
You deal with these two. No loose ends.
Mmm-hmm.

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.445
You fucking rat.

01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:30.760
We told you to stay out of the way.
(ASHBURN CHUCKLES)

01:44:32.160 --> 01:44:33.366
Good-bye.

01:44:33.520 --> 01:44:34.851
You fucking rat!

01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:37.084
See you, buddy.
Don't call me buddy.

01:44:37.800 --> 01:44:39.404
He's actually a great guy.

01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.451
All right...

01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.644
...let's have some fun.

01:44:48.760 --> 01:44:51.206
I've been waiting to
do this a long time.

01:44:52.440 --> 01:44:54.807
Campbell soup, you're up first.

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.685
Please don't hurt us.

01:44:56.840 --> 01:44:59.241
Please. I didn't mean
to say the shit I said.

01:44:59.480 --> 01:45:00.481
Don't hurt us.

01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:02.326

01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.565
Mullins, gun at two-thirty!

01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:13.246
(GUNSHOTS)

01:45:13.320 --> 01:45:14.526
Get it!

01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:17.561
Don't!

01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.089
You take one step
and your partner gets it.

01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:23.040
(GRUNTING)

01:45:23.560 --> 01:45:24.686
Oh!
(THUDDING)

01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:26.161
Oh, shit.

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:27.407
Nice.

01:45:28.480 --> 01:45:29.527
Oh, God!

01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:30.647
Look at me.
Are you okay?

01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:32.490
I think I'm gonna throw up.

01:45:32.760 --> 01:45:35.161
That was
a really bad head-butt.

01:45:35.400 --> 01:45:37.482
It was good... but
you're gonna feel it.

01:45:37.680 --> 01:45:39.011
Go!
Get yourself untied.

01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:41.322
Then we're gonna go
get Jason. Got it?

01:45:43.880 --> 01:45:45.211
MULLINS: Why won't they
answer the fucking phone?

01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:46.731
ASHBURN: Go, go, go!

01:45:54.360 --> 01:45:55.441
Oh, dick-fucker!

(PHONES RINGING)

01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.882
Get off the fucking phone!

01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:03.125
Useless!

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:18.045
NURSE: We got something!
(GRUNTING)

01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:20.804
I got it.
Get her on the stretcher.

01:46:20.960 --> 01:46:23.804
No, I got it. I got it!
(COCKING GUN)

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:26.965
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

01:46:27.120 --> 01:46:28.485
Wow, crap.

01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:31.484
Here we go. Oh, crap.
All right. Got to turn.

01:46:31.960 --> 01:46:32.961
Call 911!

01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.651
You won't shoot me?

01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:36.211
Just call it!

01:46:39.680 --> 01:46:41.523
Where is my brother,
you asshole?

01:46:41.680 --> 01:46:43.921
It's that kind of language
from your family

01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:45.804
that forced us to move
him to the east wing.

01:46:46.200 --> 01:46:47.531
Move, dipshit!

01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:49.211
Jason, I'm coming!

01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:50.846
What the fuck?

01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:55.131
Come on, come on.

01:46:57.160 --> 01:46:59.003
This stupid chair!

01:46:59.520 --> 01:47:01.443
Screw it. (BLOWS)

01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:21.644
(GRUNTING)

01:47:27.240 --> 01:47:29.686
It's amazing what a little air

01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:32.240
in the bloodstream
does to the human heart.

01:47:32.840 --> 01:47:34.569
You may not want to watch this.

01:47:34.840 --> 01:47:36.001
Wait!

01:47:36.240 --> 01:47:39.050
I just want you to know
that I get it.

01:47:40.000 --> 01:47:41.684
I get it. I mean...

01:47:42.600 --> 01:47:45.251
...I've been on the job
a long time and...

01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:49.605
...you just see so many bad
things and bad people and...

01:47:50.240 --> 01:47:54.768
...you just start to wonder if
there's anybody good anymore and...

01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:58.922
...I just want you to know that
you don't have to do this.

01:47:59.840 --> 01:48:01.444
You don't have to do it.

01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:04.771
I know.

01:48:05.760 --> 01:48:07.125
But I do.

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:09.328
Because I have plans
that don't involve

01:48:09.400 --> 01:48:11.448
me going to prison
with people I put there.

01:48:11.680 --> 01:48:13.762
So say good-bye
to your mick brother.

01:48:13.880 --> 01:48:14.881
MULLINS: Wait!

01:48:15.680 --> 01:48:17.444
Drop it or I'll
fire this weapon!

01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:18.761
Or I inject...

01:48:21.960 --> 01:48:23.644
Oh, you shot him in the dick!

01:48:23.840 --> 01:48:25.171
Twice.

01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:26.527
Oh, shit!

01:48:26.840 --> 01:48:29.002
I took a page right out
of your book, partner.

01:48:29.320 --> 01:48:31.527
But I've never done it.

01:48:31.840 --> 01:48:35.322
I just aim it at it. I don't actually do it.
That's too fucking crazy.

01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.851
What about Julian?

01:48:36.920 --> 01:48:38.160
I take the bullets out!

01:48:38.480 --> 01:48:42.326
I just use it as a tactic to scare him.
I mean, Jesus, I'm not crazy!

01:48:42.640 --> 01:48:44.642
Don't make me
feel bad about it!

01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:46.325
No, I know.

01:48:46.800 --> 01:48:49.007
Ooh, watch that leg.
(GROANING)

01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:51.650

Internal Affairs is going to open
a top-to-bottom investigation

01:49:03.000 --> 01:49:05.162
of every department now.

01:49:05.440 --> 01:49:06.441
Nice work.

01:49:06.680 --> 01:49:09.160
Well, it was
a team effort, sir.

01:49:09.680 --> 01:49:12.490
Yeah, we put out
an APB on Julian.

01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.882
Oh, don't bother,
he's in the trunk.

01:49:15.840 --> 01:49:17.683
Oh, and, sir...

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:21.684
...we're going to have to reopen
the Red Falls Killer case.

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.205
Good for you.

01:49:26.200 --> 01:49:29.204
I thought that would feel
good, but it felt awful.

01:49:29.520 --> 01:49:32.922
MULLINS: That's probably
gonna just keep feeling bad.

01:49:33.720 --> 01:49:35.085
But I'm glad you did it.

01:49:35.360 --> 01:49:36.850
ASHBURN: Should we be
leaving the hospital?

01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:38.365
MULLINS: Oh, shit. No.

01:49:38.680 --> 01:49:41.524
Probably not.
Probably not. Spin it.

Let's take this one.

01:49:45.160 --> 01:49:46.889
Get up here.
Is that clean?

01:49:47.040 --> 01:49:48.326
It's clean enough.

01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:51.604
Oh, my God! It smells like
several people died on here.

01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:54.241
Let me just sit. I don't
need to be on my face!

01:49:54.440 --> 01:49:55.885
(GROANING) You can
help the process.

01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.725

Just flip me.

get off the leg.

I want this place
locked down, people!

01:50:08.240 --> 01:50:10.402
Nobody goes in or out
without talking to me!

01:50:10.680 --> 01:50:13.684
I want you three stationed at each
end of the east wing. Let's go!

01:50:13.960 --> 01:50:15.724
Let's clear
this hallway, people!

01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:18.085
Get the press out of here.

01:50:20.600 --> 01:50:21.601
You Okay?

01:50:22.040 --> 01:50:24.042
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:26.124
Yeah, I knew you would be.

01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.971
I'm good, too.

01:50:29.400 --> 01:50:30.401
Excuse me.

01:50:30.600 --> 01:50:33.809
This woman is one of the
best agents in the FBI.

01:50:34.120 --> 01:50:36.805
Make sure she's well taken care of.
All right?

01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:41.121
That was...

01:50:41.560 --> 01:50:43.403
That was interesting, right?

01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:45.603
I would look into that.

01:50:46.000 --> 01:50:47.331
(GURNEY THUMPS) What is that?

01:50:48.320 --> 01:50:49.890
All right, let's go.

01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:51.604
You actually have to stay here.

01:50:51.920 --> 01:50:55.163
Well, just do what you
can to save that leg.

01:50:55.600 --> 01:50:57.284
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, I'm not a doctor.

01:50:57.600 --> 01:50:59.762
All right, fucktard,
I know you're not a doctor.

01:50:59.960 --> 01:51:02.406
But tell it to the doctor!
How about that?

01:51:05.960 --> 01:51:09.009
All right! I'll wait
right here for you!

01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:11.084
Throw out that sandwich!

01:51:11.240 --> 01:51:12.480
I'll bring you that sandwich!

01:51:12.600 --> 01:51:13.806
No! Throw it out!

01:51:13.960 --> 01:51:15.564
You got it, buddy.

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:18.120
CAPTAIN WOODS: For outstanding service...

01:51:18.160 --> 01:51:20.003
...Officer Shannon Mullins.
(CAMERAS CLICKING)

01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:40.368
There you go, Shannon! That's
what I'm talking about!

01:51:45.160 --> 01:51:47.367
Now hold it up!
Hold it up! Yeah!

01:51:59.320 --> 01:52:00.685

01:52:09.000 --> 01:52:10.684
Yeah! To Jason!

01:52:10.920 --> 01:52:12.524
May I have your attention?

01:52:12.680 --> 01:52:14.760
I wanted you to have this.
It was your grandmother's.

01:52:15.160 --> 01:52:16.844
She would have been
very proud of you

01:52:16.920 --> 01:52:18.649
for taking care
of your brother.

01:52:20.520 --> 01:52:22.363
That's awesome.
Take a picture.

01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:25.286
Take a picture!
Come on, take a picture!

01:52:25.360 --> 01:52:26.486
JASON: Are you serious?

01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:28.531
"Dunkin' Jesus"?

01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.210
No cell phones.

01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.331
How about now?

01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:38.006
Oh, different story?
Aw, come on back!

01:52:38.320 --> 01:52:39.765
(PHONE RINGING)

01:52:44.560 --> 01:52:46.050
MULLINS: <i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:52:46.560 --> 01:52:49.803
So, you getting all
settled in your new digs?

01:52:50.040 --> 01:52:54.045
<i>Yeah, they're pretty sweet. Who
needed that promotion anyway?</i>

01:52:54.360 --> 01:52:56.886
I'm glad I stayed around
where all the action is.

01:52:57.080 --> 01:53:00.209
We got a lot of scumbags
to take down here in Boston.

01:53:00.400 --> 01:53:01.640
Yeah, we do.

01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:04.082
<i>Hey... did you get
that package I sent?</i>

01:53:04.400 --> 01:53:06.448
Oh, I haven't opened it yet.
I'm sorry.

01:53:06.520 --> 01:53:08.568
Your dad sent me
something, too.

01:53:08.920 --> 01:53:11.241
So it's like
the Mullins gift day.

01:53:12.400 --> 01:53:13.481
Oh. Okay.

01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:15.603
I signed it in the front.

01:53:15.840 --> 01:53:17.922
Does that mean you broke
into my house again?

01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:19.525
Maybe, maybe not.

01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:21.603
Amazing how that door
opens all by itself.

01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:23.684
I see it. Very funny.

01:53:23.760 --> 01:53:26.843
I know. I was just kidding.
Look at the back.

01:53:27.040 --> 01:53:29.042
<i>Oh, you wrote something
else mean and...</i>

01:53:29.560 --> 01:53:31.289
...profanity-laden
in the back?

01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:32.931
Okay, here it is.

01:53:38.760 --> 01:53:41.604
Well... don't make it weird.

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.521
Later, nerd.

01:53:46.920 --> 01:53:48.604
It takes a nerd to know a nerd.

01:53:49.080 --> 01:53:51.765
Okay. You made it weird. Bye.

01:53:54.800 --> 01:53:56.450

01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:20.644
Hey, there's, uh...

01:54:20.800 --> 01:54:23.531
...something I've been
thinking about a lot

01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.250
that's been bothering me and...

01:54:25.560 --> 01:54:26.925
I got you something.
Oh.

01:54:31.640 --> 01:54:33.005
I found your friend.

01:54:34.160 --> 01:54:36.162
Pumpkin!
Awesome, right?

01:54:36.480 --> 01:54:37.845
I drove all the way
to New Jersey,

01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:40.287
and I was up and down these
streets, looking all over.

01:54:40.600 --> 01:54:42.170
I was just about to give up,

01:54:42.280 --> 01:54:43.850
and I was over
by your old place,

01:54:43.920 --> 01:54:45.445
and suddenly I hear
this little bell.

01:54:45.600 --> 01:54:48.365
I thought, wait a minute! I looked
in your neighbor's window...

01:54:48.600 --> 01:54:50.682
...and I saw this asshole
sitting right on the couch.

01:54:50.840 --> 01:54:52.410
I said,
"You are coming with me,"

01:54:52.480 --> 01:54:54.005
"even if you don't want
to go back with her."

01:54:54.160 --> 01:54:55.525
Oh, he fought you, huh?

01:54:55.680 --> 01:54:57.444
Yeah, he fought me pretty hard.
Wow.

01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.366
But I'm just glad that I
could make this reuniting.

01:55:01.680 --> 01:55:04.047
What a surprise this is, huh?

01:55:04.840 --> 01:55:06.842
What a surprise, huh?

01:55:07.200 --> 01:55:08.964
Look at where you are!
(MEOWS)

01:55:09.680 --> 01:55:11.603
This was never your cat, was it?
No.

01:55:11.800 --> 01:55:14.201
Goddamn it. Put him in the box.
Put him in the box!

01:55:15.800 --> 01:55:16.847
Can you put him back?

01:55:17.080 --> 01:55:18.525
Do I have a lot of choice?

01:55:18.720 --> 01:55:20.370
Can you make sure he's got

01:55:20.440 --> 01:55:22.124
lots of water?
Just don't.

01:55:22.280 --> 01:55:23.281
He likes to snuggle.

01:55:23.360 --> 01:55:25.120
Don't make me put the
cat down and punch you.

01:55:31.080 --> 01:55:34.129
