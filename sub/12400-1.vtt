23:40.794 --> 23:42.534
- You wanna take thiS?
- No, you start.

23:42.713 --> 23:44.499
You paSS her up to me

23:46.550 --> 23:49.007

My name is Kramer.

23:49.136 --> 23:50.171
Can we talk?

23:50.304 --> 23:51.885
What would you like
to talk about, Kramer?

23:52.389 --> 23:54.380
I'd like to talk about Dale.
Is he okay?

23:54.934 --> 23:56.344
Nikita: Tell him how you are, Dale.

23:56.435 --> 23:59.097
Oh, my God,
you gotta get me outta here.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.307
Just give her what she wants.
I don 't wanna die.

24:01.523 --> 24:02.774
I wanna live.

They always oversell.

24:05.903 --> 24:08.610
You got what you wanted.
Here'S what I want.

24:08.739 --> 24:10.650

your Situation?

24:10.783 --> 24:12.193

24:20.834 --> 24:22.916
If you come in, he dieS.

24:24.505 --> 24:25.540
So what do you want?

24:25.714 --> 24:26.920
I'm on a rooftop, idiot.

24:27.049 --> 24:28.755
What do you think I want?

24:30.386 --> 24:31.876
She wantS a helicopter.

24:33.722 --> 24:35.098
It'S gonna take some time.

24:35.224 --> 24:36.839
Let me know
when you have it.

24:40.813 --> 24:42.349
She waS last Spotted

24:42.523 --> 24:44.514
The building iS 14 stories.

24:44.650 --> 24:47.392
She went up eight floorS
to get to the roof?

24:47.528 --> 24:49.018
That doesn't make any kind
of tactical sense.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.269
Why go up?

24:50.406 --> 24:51.987
Why call?

24:52.116 --> 24:53.902
All it did
waS tell us where She waS.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.116
Or where She wanted us
to think She waS.

24:56.245 --> 24:57.451
But to do that...

gonna run away again?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.017

hasn't died down yet.

25:22.146 --> 25:23.602
I don't want you guys

25:23.731 --> 25:24.937

you seem determined

25:25.107 --> 25:26.722

Huh.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.601
What did you
expect us to do?

25:34.491 --> 25:36.322
I thought that
if I wasn't around,

you could move on

aSk for you to leave,

Look, Nikki,

26:10.235 --> 26:12.521
you're gonna wind up
in an alley somewhere,

26:13.655 --> 26:16.397
alone and dying,

26:16.533 --> 26:18.990
unless you stop running
and let us help you.

sends out an alert

26:33.717 --> 26:35.332
Wouldn't want the FBI to--

26:36.386 --> 26:37.296
What?

26:38.639 --> 26:39.879
They dumped me.

26:40.015 --> 26:41.630
Nikki, I'm locked out
of the system.

GueSS that meanS
I'm locked in.

26:57.032 --> 26:58.442
Can you get back in?

26:58.575 --> 27:00.691
No, they must have figured out
we were in the system.

Hang on, Mikey.
She'S trying to call me.

27:16.051 --> 27:17.086
Michael: Do not answer her.

27:17.219 --> 27:18.584
We already played it
her way.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.711
We don't have time.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.845
Now get me everything
you can find on Graham.

27:22.975 --> 27:24.340
Guys, I'm trapped
in a building

27:24.476 --> 27:25.886
full of FBI agents here.
Somebody please talk to me.

27:26.061 --> 27:27.267
Hey, would you please
talk to her

27:27.396 --> 27:29.057
before She loseS patience
and decides to try

27:29.231 --> 27:31.347
and Shoot her way through
the Side of the building?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.223
What happens
if I Shoot the fan out?

27:33.861 --> 27:37.399
Uh, Birkhoff
sayS do not Shoot the fan.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.355

27:42.744 --> 27:46.111
All right, what'S the plan
to get me outta here then?

27:46.248 --> 27:48.910
Uh, in progress.

27:49.042 --> 27:51.704
I'm kinda curious about
the plan that got you in there.

27:51.879 --> 27:53.039
Dale Gordon?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.378
Karl Jaeger.

27:57.759 --> 27:58.965
You found a connection.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.709
Nikita: The police took evidence
from the scene

28:00.846 --> 28:02.382
where Jaeger was shot,
and the blood samples

28:02.514 --> 28:03.970
showed abnormal
"B" and "T" cells.

28:04.099 --> 28:05.384
But then when they
did the autopsy,

28:05.517 --> 28:07.098
the blood work was ﬁne.

28:07.269 --> 28:10.306
Germans just assumed that
the samples were contaminated.

28:10.439 --> 28:13.727
But I don 't know, Ryan,

28:13.859 --> 28:15.269
what if there
waS something else?

28:15.402 --> 28:16.938
Something in the blood?

28:17.696 --> 28:19.402
Like a drug.

28:20.616 --> 28:22.402
The blood on the scene
would have traces of it.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.910
It could've Skewed
the results.

28:24.036 --> 28:25.401
But by the time
they did the autopsy,

28:25.537 --> 28:27.653
the drug would
be out of hiS system,

28:27.789 --> 28:29.996
so the blood seemed clear.

28:30.125 --> 28:31.410

28:31.543 --> 28:33.659
especially oneS
that modify behavior.

28:34.421 --> 28:38.209
Yeah, I ran that,
but there'S some snags,

28:38.342 --> 28:40.298
mostly with time line.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.093
How'd you figure
thiS Jaeger thing out?

28:58.528 --> 29:00.189
Alex: I see the shipment.

29:01.949 --> 29:04.065
- It'S only four men.
Sonya: Did you say four?

can Spin straw into gold,

iS going on here.

with a heart of gold.

35:16.615 --> 35:18.526
Too bad you didn't feel
the same way about Spencer.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.400
I didn't kill her.
I tried to warn her.

35:21.536 --> 35:23.492
You kidnapped
the President's aide

35:23.622 --> 35:25.328
to get yourself
put on her schedule.

35:25.457 --> 35:26.572
You used the tunnels
to infiltrate yourself

35:26.708 --> 35:28.073
into the White House,

35:28.209 --> 35:30.165
somehow conning your way
into the blue sector,

35:30.295 --> 35:32.707
all to try and warn her?

35:32.839 --> 35:35.330
I did warn the President.

35:35.467 --> 35:37.674
And then She Shot herself
in the head?

35:40.472 --> 35:42.588
Autopsy report sayS the gun
waS fired at close range,

35:42.724 --> 35:44.885
possibly pressed up
against her temple.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.724
There were only
two people in that room.

35:46.895 --> 35:48.385
So if you
didn't pull the trigger,

35:48.521 --> 35:51.604
that only leaveS me
with one other possible culprit.

35:52.817 --> 35:54.478
Only if you
have an open mind.

35:54.611 --> 35:56.647
Let'S say that I do.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.233
You went there to warn her.

36:00.367 --> 36:01.732
Still one problem
with your story:

36:01.910 --> 36:03.116
Why did you bring the gun?

36:03.203 --> 36:05.159

36:27.727 --> 36:30.309
You and your friends
haven't scared me off, you know.

36:30.605 --> 36:31.811
I'll go home tonight
and make sure

36:31.940 --> 36:33.396

36:33.525 --> 36:35.436
but tomorrow, I'll start
hunting you again.

36:35.610 --> 36:37.646
Thought you were afraid
of losing yourjob.

36:37.779 --> 36:39.735
They could force me
to retire,

36:39.864 --> 36:41.946
but that'II just give me more
free time to dedicate to you.

36:42.075 --> 36:43.531

36:43.660 --> 36:45.776

what happened that day.

Wait.

37:20.864 --> 37:22.479
That fitS with
what Nikita found.

37:23.825 --> 37:25.861
Alex, I think you may
have found the puzzle piece

37:25.994 --> 37:27.655
we were looking for.

37:27.829 --> 37:29.740
That'S great.
So what doeS it mean?

37:30.623 --> 37:32.238
It can't be.

37:32.375 --> 37:33.831
Yeah, I think we're
gonna have to wait on that.

that Dale Gordon was inside
the mobile command center

41:02.251 --> 41:04.458
at the time
of the explosion.

41:04.587 --> 41:06.703
Authorities believe
that Nikita Mears

may have planted
the bomb on Gordon

41:08.758 --> 41:10.464
while she
was holding him hostage.

41:10.593 --> 41:12.129

are still coming in,

that Gordon,

ﬁne men and women

is still at large.

41:37.036 --> 41:38.901
As today's events
have shown,

41:39.080 --> 41:41.116
Nikita Mears
is highly dangerous

anyone who gets in her way.
