you remember but...

34:06.493 --> 34:08.993
You hog-tied me to the bathroom sink.

34:08.995 --> 34:11.728
(LAUGHS) Well, yeah.

34:11.731 --> 34:14.766
I want to apologize for that.

34:14.768 --> 34:17.034
No, honestly, I should
be the one apologizing.

34:17.036 --> 34:21.239
I mean... when you got
back, I assumed the worst

34:21.241 --> 34:24.175
about you but, I mean,
I'm more screwed up

34:24.177 --> 34:25.810
than anyone else.

34:25.812 --> 34:28.646
Well, we've all got demons, right?

34:34.253 --> 34:37.422
You know...

34:37.424 --> 34:40.958
you said some things
when you were out of it.

34:43.929 --> 34:48.132
Something about a... a body.

34:49.400 --> 34:50.967
I've had these images

34:50.969 --> 34:52.969
in my head for years...

34:57.076 --> 34:59.177
...since I was a teenager.

35:01.246 --> 35:02.613
Disturbing images...

35:02.615 --> 35:05.883
and they came to life last night

35:05.885 --> 35:07.552
when I was hallucinating.

35:07.554 --> 35:09.620
Oh.

35:09.622 --> 35:11.989
Images of what?

35:11.991 --> 35:14.759
Somebody dragging a
body down the stairs.

35:14.761 --> 35:17.261
The spindle breaking.

35:19.465 --> 35:21.566
You know, I always
thought it was some sort

35:21.568 --> 35:23.167
of drug-induced nightmare,

35:23.169 --> 35:28.139
but now with the belt and
the cops, I-I mean...

35:28.141 --> 35:30.074
what if it's some sort
of repressed memory?

35:30.076 --> 35:32.243
What if that's what the cops
are here to talk to me about?

35:32.245 --> 35:33.578
What if I was a part of something?

35:33.580 --> 35:35.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, listen to me.

35:35.482 --> 35:37.849
The stress and the drugs,

35:37.851 --> 35:40.318
all of it, it messes with your head.

35:40.320 --> 35:42.487
Yeah. Whatever it was

35:42.489 --> 35:44.455
you think you saw...

35:44.457 --> 35:47.825
it was not real.

35:50.896 --> 35:51.896
It's like that time

35:51.898 --> 35:53.264
in <i>Roger's Cube,</i>

35:53.266 --> 35:55.333
when Roger thought his girlfriend

35:55.335 --> 36:00.004
was cheating on him, but
really she was just into yoga.

36:00.006 --> 36:02.206
(CHUCKLES)

36:03.041 --> 36:05.042
You read my comic?

36:05.044 --> 36:07.211
They have papers in Maine.

36:21.160 --> 36:24.195
- (KNOCKING ON DOOR)
- Lieutenant wants to see you.

36:24.197 --> 36:26.397
DNA results are in.

36:32.771 --> 36:34.906
(SIGHS)

36:35.974 --> 36:38.209
Are you okay?

36:38.211 --> 36:39.677
I'm so sorry I wasn't here.

36:39.679 --> 36:41.345
Yeah, well, I thought maybe
you just didn't want

36:41.347 --> 36:43.014
to see me go through this again.

36:43.016 --> 36:46.017
I know how pathetic I must be to you.

36:46.019 --> 36:49.353
I don't think that, and
neither should you.

36:52.524 --> 36:54.992
It's in your genes, you know.

36:54.994 --> 36:59.430
My mother was an addict, an alcoholic.

36:59.432 --> 37:01.432
It's one of the reasons
I left home so young.

37:01.434 --> 37:03.367
I never knew that.

37:03.369 --> 37:05.236
I don't like to talk about it,

37:05.238 --> 37:08.139
but it's why I'm tough on you...

37:08.141 --> 37:11.275
because I know what it
can do to a child...

37:11.277 --> 37:12.944
and Jack needs you.

37:12.946 --> 37:14.946
I'm trying.

37:14.948 --> 37:16.647
I am.

37:21.053 --> 37:23.154
I know.

37:28.927 --> 37:30.728
Hey.

37:32.097 --> 37:34.832
How was the spa?

37:36.201 --> 37:39.737
More expensive than I remembered.

37:42.374 --> 37:45.076
(DOG BARKING, SIREN WAILING IN DISTANCE)

37:48.947 --> 37:51.282
You really need to get a cell phone.

37:53.252 --> 37:54.652
How's your brother?

37:54.654 --> 37:56.621
He's better.

37:56.623 --> 37:59.257
Thanks.

38:03.061 --> 38:05.830
I want to take you somewhere.

38:06.898 --> 38:08.566
Where?

38:08.568 --> 38:13.537
Somewhere I think will help
you understand me better.

38:16.575 --> 38:18.876
What changed your mind all of a sudden?

38:18.878 --> 38:22.213
I'll tell you when we get there.

38:32.291 --> 38:33.824
(DOOR OPENS)

38:33.826 --> 38:35.926
Hey.

38:35.928 --> 38:37.495
Where have you been? I've
been trying to call you.

38:37.497 --> 38:40.031
We're gonna be late for the debate...

38:42.134 --> 38:44.001
What's wrong?

38:53.945 --> 38:55.913
(SPINDLE SNAPPING)

39:02.120 --> 39:04.055
Okay.

39:05.357 --> 39:07.558
The DNA came back.

39:07.560 --> 39:09.627
Cam's blood was not a match.

39:09.629 --> 39:13.097
Oh. Oh, thank God!

39:13.099 --> 39:16.734
Tess, wait, there's more.

39:16.736 --> 39:18.402
There's more.

39:22.841 --> 39:24.842
Cam wasn't a match,

39:24.844 --> 39:27.745
but there was a familial match.

39:30.482 --> 39:33.351
What does that mean?

39:42.828 --> 39:44.662
It means the blood on the belt

39:44.664 --> 39:46.530
belongs to someone in your family.

39:49.634 --> 39:51.969
One of them is Silver Bells.
