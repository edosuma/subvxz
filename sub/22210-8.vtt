00:02.169 --> 00:04.286
<i>Previously on</i>
Crisis on Earth X...

00:04.379 --> 00:05.915
- To Barry and Iris.
- To Barry and Iris.

00:06.048 --> 00:07.539
- Are you asking me to marry you?
- I am.

00:07.633 --> 00:08.623
- Just forget about it.
- Felicity.

00:08.717 --> 00:10.049
I don't wanna marry you.

00:10.135 --> 00:11.876
I just called off my engagement.

00:12.012 --> 00:13.674
To making things go away.

00:13.764 --> 00:16.632
<i>Does anyone have just cause
why these two should not be married?</i>

00:17.643 --> 00:19.134
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.218
<i>Nazis?</i>

00:20.312 --> 00:21.302
<i>Why would Nazis want to
crash my wedding?</i>

00:21.396 --> 00:23.137
There's a 53rd Earth called Earth-X.

00:23.232 --> 00:25.144
Basically, our Earth
with one difference.

00:25.234 --> 00:26.224
The Nazis won the war.

00:26.318 --> 00:28.355
<i>I call it
"Calm after the Firestorm."</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:30.107
No powers for either of us.

00:30.197 --> 00:32.405
<i>The other archer
and flying woman</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:34.232
<i>are Oliver and Kara of Earth-X.</i>

00:34.326 --> 00:35.988
<i>And Thawne is working with them.</i>

00:36.078 --> 00:37.740
<i>The General is dying.</i>

00:37.829 --> 00:40.913
All we need is a new heart
and we found the perfect donor.

00:44.461 --> 00:46.077
<i>I don't think
this is our Earth.</i>

01:04.313 --> 01:05.680
<i>Eyes front!</i>

01:06.733 --> 01:08.895
So, this craphole is Earth-X.

01:10.320 --> 01:11.527
Wells was right.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.694
He usually is.

01:12.948 --> 01:16.157
It's hard to believe a place like this
actually exists. On any Earth.

01:17.744 --> 01:21.363
I wish I shared your sentiment,
but in all my travels to distant times,

01:21.832 --> 01:24.449
one thing sadly remains constant,

01:24.543 --> 01:27.456
is man's ability to feel hatred
for other men.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.045
<i>Keep moving.</i>

01:29.214 --> 01:30.375
<i>Move.</i>

01:36.722 --> 01:38.509
Stars and triangles.

01:38.599 --> 01:41.262
Badges used to identify reported crimes

01:41.351 --> 01:44.310
these people have quote-unquote
committed to land in here.

01:48.734 --> 01:50.145
What's the pink triangle for?

01:50.527 --> 01:51.688
<i>What'd you do?</i>

01:53.155 --> 01:54.521
I loved the wrong person.

01:58.452 --> 02:00.785
We gotta get out of these things.
Transmute us out.

02:00.871 --> 02:01.861
With pleasure.

02:04.541 --> 02:06.123
I can't vibrate through them either.

02:06.835 --> 02:08.201
Power-dampening collars.

02:09.170 --> 02:10.332
Why are we wearing them, then?

02:12.424 --> 02:14.962
Doesn't matter.
There's too many guards here, anyways.

02:16.428 --> 02:17.885
They're going to kill my sister.

02:18.096 --> 02:20.588
Look, we're not gonna
let that happen, Alex, I promise you.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.258
We're gonna get back to our Earth
before them.

02:23.352 --> 02:24.934
How? We don't even know how we got here.

02:25.187 --> 02:27.019
No, we don't. We're gonna figure it out.

02:27.522 --> 02:29.388
Then we're gonna find a way
to get out of this place

02:29.566 --> 02:31.102
and we're gonna get back
to the people we love.

02:31.693 --> 02:33.400
I hope everyone else is okay.

02:56.385 --> 02:57.375
Oh.

02:57.928 --> 02:59.965
<i>Rip Van Ramon awakens.</i>

03:04.351 --> 03:05.808
This doesn't look like a wedding.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.680
You missed quite a bit, Cisco.

03:10.774 --> 03:13.608
All you need to know is that
you're locked in one of your

03:13.694 --> 03:16.562
<i>fabulous anti-meta-human cells
with the rest of us.</i>

03:16.655 --> 03:17.645
And we can't escape.

03:17.739 --> 03:20.652
Of course we can't.
That's what I designed them for, genius.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.028
Good command of the obvious.

03:22.953 --> 03:25.161
- Boys...
- Is that a ball?

03:25.247 --> 03:26.738
Why? Is it bothering you?

03:26.832 --> 03:27.913
Yes.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.658
God!

03:30.752 --> 03:31.742
Hey!

03:34.339 --> 03:36.922
Are they gonna do that
the whole time we're in here?

03:37.008 --> 03:37.998
Probably.

03:38.093 --> 03:40.255
- It hurts. Cut it out.
<i>- Cut what out?</i>

03:47.811 --> 03:48.801
S.T.A.R. Labs.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.684
Feels like old times, doesn't it?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.941
You know, I built this place?

03:56.903 --> 04:01.147
With my own hands,
and called it home for 15 years.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.314
And do you know what?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.695
I hated every minute of it.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.615
- Where are my friends?
- Your friends...

04:10.959 --> 04:12.040
They're on Earth-X.

04:12.794 --> 04:14.751
But I wouldn't worry about
your friends too much

04:14.838 --> 04:18.457
because they're not going to be alive
much longer.

04:21.762 --> 04:23.173
<i>Oh, my.</i>

04:24.139 --> 04:26.552
It's because of the red sunlight.

04:26.933 --> 04:31.519
And trust me, it'll make you
weaker than you can possibly imagine.

04:38.987 --> 04:42.355
You did all this just... Just to get me?

04:43.241 --> 04:45.028
Do you know how many
innocent people you killed?

04:45.452 --> 04:47.318
Their lives to save mine?

04:48.955 --> 04:50.446
Well, they should feel honored.

04:54.294 --> 04:55.956
It's a strange sensation, isn't it?

04:56.797 --> 04:57.958
Feeling vulnerable.

05:00.258 --> 05:02.295
And it's just gonna get worse

05:02.594 --> 05:05.837
because this red sunlight,
it's softening you up,

05:06.389 --> 05:10.224
until pretty soon, I'm gonna
crack you open like a walnut.

05:11.478 --> 05:12.935
Then I'm gonna take your healthy heart.

05:14.564 --> 05:16.100
I'm gonna put it in her.

05:18.735 --> 05:21.148
Which means we should probably
get you going.

05:22.113 --> 05:23.103
Good.

05:23.281 --> 05:25.068
That'll give me time to talk to

05:26.451 --> 05:27.612
myself.

05:32.123 --> 05:33.580
Did you hear that?

05:34.334 --> 05:35.450
Everyone else is on Earth-X.

05:35.544 --> 05:38.332
Kara only has a few hours
before they go full Mengele on her.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.997
- We gotta stop them.
<i>- Got any ideas?</i>

05:41.091 --> 05:43.083
I don't know.
Give me some time to think.

05:43.176 --> 05:45.042
Iris, I'm all for girl power
and everything, but how are you and I

05:45.136 --> 05:47.799
gonna stop the meaner Nazi version of
my whatever he is right now,

05:47.889 --> 05:50.006
and people with superpowers?

05:51.518 --> 05:54.727
We don't have to, we just need
to get to the pipeline and get Cisco.

05:54.813 --> 05:56.805
He could turn off all the power to
the building and breach us out of here.

05:56.898 --> 05:58.639
Do you know how to get to the pipeline
from here?

06:00.944 --> 06:03.106
- I think so.
- Lead the way, McClane.

06:11.788 --> 06:12.824
<i>Move!</i>

06:12.914 --> 06:14.450
I don't like the looks of this.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.203
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

06:16.293 --> 06:17.534
<i>Keep moving.</i>

06:17.627 --> 06:18.617
What are we doing?

06:18.837 --> 06:21.079
- It's round-up time.
- Round-up for what?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.421
<i>In line. Now!</i>

06:37.606 --> 06:39.518
<i>So, these are...</i>

06:40.275 --> 06:41.891
The heroes.

06:42.611 --> 06:44.022
<i>Yes,</i> Sturmbannführer.

06:57.167 --> 07:02.208
Blond hair, blue eyes.
This is Nordic perfection.

07:05.717 --> 07:08.801
Why would you align yourself
with the unpure?

07:09.262 --> 07:10.673
Because I like men.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.013
And I like women.

07:18.688 --> 07:22.056
You know, I had a daughter
who looked just like you.

07:22.734 --> 07:24.566
With similar compulsions.

07:32.702 --> 07:35.035
And I expunged that filth

07:36.122 --> 07:38.159
from my family line forever.

07:43.505 --> 07:44.586
Bring them all.

07:47.092 --> 07:48.128
And him!

07:51.388 --> 07:54.472
<i>Move! Now! Go!</i>

08:01.189 --> 08:03.556
Not to be an alarmist,
but if we don't have an escape plan,

08:03.650 --> 08:05.437
I suggest we get one immediately.

08:35.974 --> 08:37.181
Up!

08:49.612 --> 08:50.602
Go.

09:04.711 --> 09:05.827
Turn around.

09:11.551 --> 09:13.634
I know you are not him,

09:15.346 --> 09:17.588
but I cannot stomach
the sight regardless.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.814
Ready!

09:31.571 --> 09:32.812
I'm sorry, Kara.

09:38.244 --> 09:39.325
Aim!

09:50.298 --> 09:51.539
I hate fire!

09:52.842 --> 09:54.333
- Snart?
- Snart?

10:00.725 --> 10:01.841
- Snart?
- Snart?

10:02.769 --> 10:03.930
About time!

10:05.355 --> 10:06.641
Kill them all!

10:08.983 --> 10:09.973
Take cover!

10:28.211 --> 10:29.793
Hey? You're cutting it close.

10:30.004 --> 10:32.212
I thought that was great timing.
I really enjoyed the pun.

10:33.174 --> 10:34.790
So, you're Leonard Snart's doppelganger.

10:34.884 --> 10:37.467
No, I'm Leonard Snart,
but you can call me Leo.

10:37.637 --> 10:40.675
That is a fantastic outfit.
Did you make that?

10:41.975 --> 10:43.557
- Leo?
- Right!

10:43.935 --> 10:45.392
Time to make you shine, buddy.

10:45.728 --> 10:46.718
Uh, you...

10:47.689 --> 10:48.930
You might wanna close your eyes.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.347
Why?

10:57.448 --> 10:59.690
I believe he just answered
your question.

11:12.213 --> 11:13.545
Come on, let's go.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.206
- Where we going?
- To our base.

11:16.301 --> 11:18.668
- Your base?
- And... And who are you?

11:18.761 --> 11:21.003
I was thinking exactly the same thing
about you all.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.305
You might have to tell us on the way.

11:38.031 --> 11:39.613
You're looking more human,

11:41.159 --> 11:43.742
scared, helpless, pathetic,

11:44.871 --> 11:47.329
- inferior.
- We're not that different from them.

11:48.082 --> 11:50.290
Oh, please.
We're everything they want to be.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.792
Blonde, white.

11:54.589 --> 11:57.081
- Aryan perfection.
- I'm not like you.

11:57.926 --> 11:59.838
I don't think I'm better
than everyone else.

11:59.928 --> 12:02.295
You should, you are.

12:03.389 --> 12:04.880
You're a god to them.

12:05.975 --> 12:07.466
You could've been living like one.

12:07.769 --> 12:10.102
- Like you?
- Yes, like me.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.347
They want someone to bow to.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.474
To worship. To lead.

12:16.611 --> 12:18.443
What you're doing is not leading.

12:19.155 --> 12:20.191
It's ruling.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.906
Yes, it is.

12:24.786 --> 12:26.823
They're like ants, Kara.

12:27.413 --> 12:28.995
They shouldn't fear us
for what we can do.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.915
They should rely on us
when they need us.

12:32.293 --> 12:34.876
Oh, spare me the Good Samaritan crap.

12:36.172 --> 12:39.040
I'm not going to take advantage
of anyone just because I can.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.127
The world isn't made better
by protecting the weak.

12:42.220 --> 12:44.132
It's made better by getting rid of them.

12:47.892 --> 12:49.474
You really are pathetic.

12:51.938 --> 12:53.554
You know, I saw you at the wedding.

12:54.524 --> 12:55.731
By yourself.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.901
Poor lonely little Kara,

13:00.446 --> 13:02.984
can't even find a date to a wedding.

13:04.492 --> 13:06.074
You don't know
what you're talking about.

13:07.036 --> 13:12.327
It's written all over that
pouty little face of yours.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.788
You spend so much time on your planet
taking care of everyone but yourself.

13:19.007 --> 13:23.468
No wonder you seem so utterly miserable.

13:24.220 --> 13:25.711
It's not going to work.

13:26.180 --> 13:27.591
You're not going to get what you want.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.757
Really?

13:32.729 --> 13:34.891
Why do you care if I take your heart?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.441
You're not using it.

13:40.903 --> 13:42.360
At least I have one.

13:48.286 --> 13:49.618
<i>We're almost ready.</i>

13:58.838 --> 13:59.919
Clear.

14:04.260 --> 14:05.842
I know bad guys have inopportune timing,

14:05.928 --> 14:07.635
but this is, like,
the worst timing ever.

14:07.722 --> 14:08.712
Yeah, tell me about it, sister.

14:08.806 --> 14:10.138
Barry and I were
just about to get married.

14:10.224 --> 14:11.214
At least you guys left on good terms.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.971
Last thing I said to Oliver was,
"I don't want to marry you."

14:13.061 --> 14:15.428
And now, he's stuck in Nazi world.
What if we never see them again?

14:16.647 --> 14:19.481
<i>Stop! Hands in the air.</i>

14:30.036 --> 14:32.369
- That was extremely badass.
- Same to you.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.029
Cisco?

14:34.123 --> 14:35.204
<i>Cisco!</i>

14:35.291 --> 14:36.372
Hey!

14:36.459 --> 14:38.792
Guys! We're trapped in here!

14:39.128 --> 14:40.118
We're gonna get you out of here.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.507
- Oh, you've got to be kidding me.
<i>- What?</i>

14:45.593 --> 14:47.835
- I can't open the blast door.
- You mean they're trapped?

14:50.264 --> 14:51.675
I'll send an SOS to the Legends.

14:51.766 --> 14:53.553
How long will it take
for them to get it?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.259
Depends where they are in time.

14:55.603 --> 14:56.810
I can't wait that long.

15:00.191 --> 15:01.727
It's up to us to save Kara.

15:15.540 --> 15:17.623
I guess we're in Earth-X's Star City.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.993
I have to say,
that's one hell of a story.

15:21.504 --> 15:23.791
- You're a speedster. Okay.
- Yeah.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.669
You two turn into the burning man,

15:27.635 --> 15:29.592
and you're the good doppelganger
of the <i>Führer.</i>

15:30.555 --> 15:32.763
"Good" might be an oversimplification.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.800
You still haven't told us
which Earth you're from.

15:35.893 --> 15:38.431
Clearly it's not this one.

15:38.980 --> 15:40.096
We're from Earth-1.

15:40.481 --> 15:41.847
Earth-1. Well,

15:42.400 --> 15:43.390
golly.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.818
Am I missing something here?

15:47.447 --> 15:48.733
I'm from Earth-1, too.

15:49.532 --> 15:52.070
If you're from our Earth, then you know
how we got here, don't you?

15:52.743 --> 15:54.154
Yeah. I have a pretty good idea.

15:56.122 --> 15:57.863
I think you guys

15:58.916 --> 16:00.532
came through this.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.126
A temporal gateway?

16:04.213 --> 16:07.126
Same physics as a breach.
Just more stable, and larger.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.206
Yeah, much larger.

16:09.635 --> 16:10.876
So, we have a way to get back?

16:13.764 --> 16:14.971
So, where is this thing?

16:15.057 --> 16:18.550
- It's actually not too far from here.
- 22.3 kilometers, to be exact.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.852
- Well, we drive it.
- Good. So, take us to it.

16:21.981 --> 16:23.438
Can't do that.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.598
Why?

16:24.942 --> 16:26.524
Because the gateway's in a facility

16:26.611 --> 16:29.604
guarded by a not-so-small army of Nazis.

16:30.823 --> 16:32.234
Yeah, well, we've faced worse, so...

16:32.325 --> 16:33.861
Look, it's our only way home.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.450
We're going through it.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.947
Nobody's going through anything.

16:38.414 --> 16:40.121
Because we're blowing it the hell up.

16:47.507 --> 16:48.497
Winn?

16:48.591 --> 16:50.833
Please, Freedom Fighter, General Schott.

16:51.135 --> 16:52.876
- General Schott?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

16:53.179 --> 16:55.671
- And who are you?
- New friends from Earth-1.

16:55.765 --> 16:56.881
They're on our side.

16:56.974 --> 17:00.217
Except for the part where you guys wanna
blow up our only way home.

17:00.311 --> 17:01.597
We don't exactly want to.

17:01.729 --> 17:03.971
Everyone we care about is on
the other side of that gateway,

17:04.190 --> 17:05.180
imprisoned by Nazis.

17:05.273 --> 17:07.641
The Nazis that want to
cut open my sister.

17:07.734 --> 17:08.771
We have to get back!

17:08.861 --> 17:11.228
Eliminate that facility,
and you eliminate our only chance

17:11.321 --> 17:12.983
of saving our friends from your enemies.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.694
I'm sorry, but we've been waiting
for an opportunity like this for years.

17:15.785 --> 17:17.696
We cannot wait any longer.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.621
This is our only chance to separate
the <i>Führer</i> from his army.

17:20.705 --> 17:22.492
We are trying to turn this war around.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.074
You are gonna leave our Earth

17:24.167 --> 17:27.080
at the mercy of the three psychopaths
who have ravaged yours.

17:27.171 --> 17:30.209
Wait, why does this man look exactly
like the <i>Führer</i> I'm trying to kill?

17:30.299 --> 17:31.585
Look, fingerless gloves,

17:31.676 --> 17:34.589
all we're asking is
for a little bit of time.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.300
Let us get into the facility
and through that gateway.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.803
The gateway's guarded
by 30 Panzer XII's,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.635
50 Sturmtigers,
and 100 Schutzstaffel officers.

17:42.728 --> 17:45.220
- Not the best odds, maybe.
- I'll take them.

17:45.314 --> 17:46.850
No! You will not!

17:47.066 --> 17:49.433
We're blowing up that gateway right now.

17:49.527 --> 17:50.517
Final order!

17:53.489 --> 17:55.355
Sorry, he's a little rough
around the edges,

17:55.449 --> 17:58.317
but he is the General,
and he's issued his commands.

17:59.161 --> 18:00.242
Hey, hey, hey.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.912
You won't change his mind. No one does.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.373
Look, on my Earth,
he and I are like family.

18:05.793 --> 18:07.625
And he would do anything
to help my sister.

18:09.422 --> 18:12.210
Ray! Let her try.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.136
You don't seem to know
how to take an order.

18:26.314 --> 18:27.896
That's because I'm used to giving them.

18:28.441 --> 18:29.807
You can't do this, Winn.

18:29.900 --> 18:31.391
General Schott.

18:31.611 --> 18:33.318
Look, I don't know
where the hell you think you are,

18:33.404 --> 18:35.862
but this planet has been
at war for generations.

18:35.948 --> 18:37.155
We are tired.

18:38.034 --> 18:41.948
There are men dying for the same causes
their grandfathers did.

18:44.290 --> 18:45.952
We're not asking you to surrender.

18:46.584 --> 18:50.123
Hey, just let us get back home
before you destroy that thing.

18:50.254 --> 18:51.961
I'm just asking for a little time.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.040
Time is what I can't give you!

18:57.720 --> 18:59.006
They have a weapon,

19:00.139 --> 19:04.930
a doomsday weapon powerful enough
to affect other worlds.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.471
It has to be eliminated.

19:12.276 --> 19:13.312
Winn.

19:13.944 --> 19:15.480
Please.

19:16.030 --> 19:19.774
The <i>Führer</i> on your Earth,
the people that you hate,

19:20.368 --> 19:25.033
they're going to kill my sister if you
don't let me get back to save her.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.287
On my Earth,
my sister is your closest friend.

19:31.379 --> 19:33.416
She's saved you countless times.

19:34.215 --> 19:36.002
You would do anything to help her.

19:36.175 --> 19:38.132
You'd do anything to help each other.

19:38.219 --> 19:39.505
No matter the risk.

19:39.762 --> 19:41.253
Without question.

19:42.556 --> 19:45.549
So, all I'm asking for is a chance.

19:46.977 --> 19:48.013
Please.

19:51.232 --> 19:54.976
I am sorry about your sister

19:56.445 --> 19:57.856
and about your Earth,

19:58.447 --> 20:00.404
I truly am,

20:01.784 --> 20:03.992
but today, I have the chance

20:04.537 --> 20:07.871
to protect my people, my Earth.

20:08.916 --> 20:10.282
My decision stands.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.538
Winn?

20:18.718 --> 20:19.754
Jefferson?

20:20.219 --> 20:21.676
Uh, Grey, I'm busy, man.

20:21.762 --> 20:23.128
Yes, I can see that,

20:23.222 --> 20:25.088
but I was hoping you might
take a moment away from your

20:25.182 --> 20:28.926
ruminations on dystopian alternative
history to accept my apology.

20:29.228 --> 20:32.016
I may be a learned man,
but I am not always an astute one.

20:32.106 --> 20:36.476
I think I was just so thrilled with
the reality of my imminent departure,

20:36.569 --> 20:38.481
that I neglected
to consider your feelings.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.063
Look, man, I'm not tryin' to take you
away from your family, or nothing.

20:41.157 --> 20:42.568
You are my family.

20:45.202 --> 20:48.036
Long before I unexpectedly found myself
with a daughter,

20:48.122 --> 20:51.035
I found myself unexpectedly with a son.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.079
- Yeah, I know. I...
- You know.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.618
You know, do you?

20:56.130 --> 21:00.340
Look around you. We're standing
in one of the darkest places imaginable.

21:00.843 --> 21:03.335
Yet somehow, I'm optimistic.

21:03.512 --> 21:05.253
- Do you know why?
- 'Cause you're a crazy old man.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.554
Yes. No!

21:07.475 --> 21:10.388
Because I'm standing here with you.

21:12.521 --> 21:14.638
You are a better son
than I could have ever hoped for.

21:16.400 --> 21:20.269
And no length of time or distance
will ever change that.

21:22.615 --> 21:24.857
A'ight. Apology accepted. Come here.

21:34.794 --> 21:35.784
What are you doing?

21:37.922 --> 21:39.083
Looking for a gun.

21:39.715 --> 21:41.331
<i>Or a knife. Anything.</i>

21:42.176 --> 21:44.634
Okay, I don't care how many Sturmtigers
they have out there,

21:44.929 --> 21:45.965
I'm gonna go save Kara

21:46.055 --> 21:47.717
with or without the help
of these people.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.088
No, you're not.

21:49.683 --> 21:53.677
I'm a government agent
certified in over 30 military weapons.

21:53.771 --> 21:55.433
And you're impressive,
I'll give you that,

21:55.731 --> 21:57.597
but you still can't fight your way

21:57.691 --> 22:00.183
through an army of Nazis
alone and scared.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.272
I'm not scared.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.562
No, not for you. For your sister.

22:07.952 --> 22:09.363
I should have done more.

22:10.371 --> 22:11.782
I mean, if I hadn't gotten so

22:12.706 --> 22:13.787
distracted.

22:13.874 --> 22:15.866
Well, sorry to be a distraction.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.292
You don't understand.

22:17.586 --> 22:19.122
I can't lose her.

22:20.256 --> 22:22.122
I understand more than you think.

22:26.262 --> 22:27.878
I lost my sister.

22:28.848 --> 22:33.513
The anger and guilt that I felt
for not being able to save her

22:35.229 --> 22:36.595
took me down a dark path.

22:37.731 --> 22:39.688
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

22:39.775 --> 22:40.891
How could you?

22:41.193 --> 22:43.480
I mean, the only thing
we know about each other

22:43.571 --> 22:45.233
is what we look like with clothes off.

22:45.990 --> 22:47.231
Beautiful, by the way.

22:48.284 --> 22:51.573
You also don't know
that I protect my team.

22:51.662 --> 22:54.700
And you, Danvers, you're on my team.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.198
And I promise you,

22:56.792 --> 22:59.580
we're not gonna let what happened
to my sister happen to yours.

23:01.088 --> 23:02.875
I'm sorry. I just want...

23:03.090 --> 23:05.707
I wanna save Kara
and I wanna get back to Maggie.

23:06.677 --> 23:07.667
Maggie is...

23:07.761 --> 23:09.468
- Complicated.
- Yeah.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.008
I had a Maggie, too.

23:12.099 --> 23:14.216
And I think about going back to her

23:14.852 --> 23:16.059
all the time.

23:16.729 --> 23:18.311
Look, Alex,

23:19.231 --> 23:21.097
you seem like
a pretty thoughtful person.

23:21.191 --> 23:23.524
And if you thought it wasn't gonna
work out and had to end it,

23:23.861 --> 23:25.477
I'm sure that reason was valid.

23:26.488 --> 23:27.854
Trust your instincts.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.738
Ray, please, let's talk to him.

23:35.831 --> 23:37.618
Look, you said to let Alex try,

23:37.708 --> 23:39.791
I let her try, she didn't succeed.

23:39.877 --> 23:41.539
So, that's that?
We'll just let these poor,

23:41.629 --> 23:44.337
strangely dressed individuals
lose their one way home?

23:44.423 --> 23:46.255
Look, it's what Winn ordered.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.710
And I'm not in the habit
of defying generals on any Earth.

23:49.970 --> 23:51.677
And what about your family?

23:52.097 --> 23:53.258
Back on Earth-1?

23:53.682 --> 23:54.672
What about them?

23:54.767 --> 23:56.929
You'd be giving up any chance
of ever seeing them again.

23:58.020 --> 23:59.101
Leo,

23:59.605 --> 24:01.312
why are you pushing this?

24:01.398 --> 24:03.765
- Pardon?
- We have fought, and bled,

24:03.859 --> 24:05.441
and sacrificed for this war,

24:05.527 --> 24:06.688
and then these strangers show up,

24:06.779 --> 24:08.816
and you're willing to throw
everything away for them?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.565
The fate of the world is at stake.

24:11.659 --> 24:13.651
So are the lives of their loved ones.

24:13.744 --> 24:14.734
Come on.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.404
Tease me all you want
for being sentimental,

24:17.539 --> 24:19.997
but these heroes would risk everything
for the people they love,

24:20.084 --> 24:21.074
just like I would.

24:22.169 --> 24:23.501
For you.

24:33.263 --> 24:35.721
You know I can't say no
when you look at me like that.

24:36.016 --> 24:37.757
That is why I look at you like that.

24:44.858 --> 24:48.147
We talked to the General,
and after a lot of arguing,

24:48.946 --> 24:50.983
- he agreed.
- We're gonna help you out.

24:58.539 --> 25:00.246
Now, you referenced 100 guards.

25:00.332 --> 25:02.198
I assume most of them
are around the perimeter?

25:02.292 --> 25:03.453
- Correct.
- All right.

25:03.544 --> 25:06.628
We fight through them outside,
we access the main corridor.

25:06.714 --> 25:08.546
What is security like inside the hangar?

25:08.632 --> 25:09.839
I'll do some recon.

25:10.801 --> 25:13.544
So, the entire facility
has meta-human dampeners.

25:14.179 --> 25:16.546
Okay, we can't take that hangar
with no powers, man.

25:16.640 --> 25:19.257
These satellites indicate a control room
off the hangar.

25:19.351 --> 25:21.092
That must be where the dampener is.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.645
Okay, well, we definitely can't take
the main control room with no powers.

25:24.732 --> 25:26.268
It's not like we blend in here.

25:33.157 --> 25:34.523
I think I know how to get in.

25:34.616 --> 25:37.825
I'm allowing this mission
against my better judgment.

25:38.579 --> 25:40.115
You have one hour.

25:41.165 --> 25:43.157
I appreciate it. We all do.

25:45.335 --> 25:46.576
Yeah, I know.

25:46.962 --> 25:47.952
I know what you're thinking.

25:48.047 --> 25:50.664
If you don't make it
through the gateway,

25:51.467 --> 25:53.424
I am not giving you more time.

25:53.510 --> 25:57.220
I will blow that place to kingdom come.

26:03.395 --> 26:05.227
Red light saturation

26:06.273 --> 26:07.809
<i>is complete.</i>

26:10.652 --> 26:12.018
She's cooked.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.655
And you will wake up
stronger than you've ever been.

26:19.745 --> 26:20.735
I love you.

26:23.957 --> 26:25.164
And I love you.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.661
Unfortunately, Miss Danvers,

26:30.631 --> 26:33.123
we need you awake for this procedure.

26:33.842 --> 26:35.003
My cousin,

26:36.095 --> 26:37.427
he'll find you.

26:38.680 --> 26:39.887
Your cousin.

26:40.974 --> 26:41.964
Really?

26:42.267 --> 26:43.428
<i>Fun tidbit.</i>

26:43.519 --> 26:45.101
I fought your cousin once,

26:45.562 --> 26:46.552
in the future.

26:46.980 --> 26:48.642
He is fast.

26:49.650 --> 26:50.811
I'm faster.

26:55.197 --> 26:58.406
- They're starting the surgery.
- I'm working on it. And...

27:17.177 --> 27:18.884
Just have backup power
and it's not enough.

27:18.971 --> 27:20.712
Well, everyone in the building
has been accounted for.

27:20.806 --> 27:22.342
Where might people be hiding?

27:47.624 --> 27:49.616
Take that, you Nazi mother...

27:52.880 --> 27:54.041
Hey, hey, hey.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.338
Come with me if you wanna live.

27:55.424 --> 27:57.507
- Get me to the sun.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.923
<i>- I got her, I got her.</i>
- Okay, okay.

28:06.727 --> 28:07.888
We've gotta go!

28:17.654 --> 28:20.567
<i>I don't believe
Mr. Thawne is done with you yet.</i>

28:32.252 --> 28:33.493
Your papers, <i>Sturmmann.</i>

28:33.962 --> 28:37.455
We don't have papers.
This is a special visit.

28:37.549 --> 28:39.586
Your papers. Now.

28:40.469 --> 28:42.176
Suit yourself,

28:42.679 --> 28:44.511
but I think you better talk to our boss.

28:48.852 --> 28:49.888
As you were.

28:50.270 --> 28:51.977
My God, my apologies, sir.

28:52.481 --> 28:54.222
<i>- Let them through!
- Let them through!</i>

28:54.691 --> 28:55.727
<i>Thank you,</i> Mein Führer.

29:21.218 --> 29:24.177
<i>Mein Führer,</i> we were...
We were not expecting you.

29:24.263 --> 29:26.129
Nor was I anticipating
being back so soon.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.131
Thanks to your incompetence.

29:28.225 --> 29:32.060
The Earth-1 doppelgangers,
my doppelganger,

29:32.521 --> 29:34.183
escaped his execution.

29:34.273 --> 29:36.185
Yes. He did.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.265
And?

29:37.609 --> 29:39.976
We are exhausting every possible means
to locate them.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.069
Good.

29:43.031 --> 29:45.899
Would you like us to delay deployment
until we do so?

29:45.993 --> 29:47.109
"Deployment"?

29:47.202 --> 29:49.194
She is inbound and ready.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.127
<i>Doomsday device.</i>

30:06.888 --> 30:08.880
<i>The</i> Wellenreiter
<i>is fully operational</i>

30:09.558 --> 30:11.550
and at the ready, <i>Mein Führer.</i>

30:14.563 --> 30:16.395
Shall we send her through?

30:17.607 --> 30:19.098
As scheduled.

30:21.361 --> 30:22.442
Begin!

30:41.757 --> 30:43.498
<i>The</i> Wellenreiter <i>is on its way.</i>

30:44.092 --> 30:45.299
Hail victory!

30:45.594 --> 30:47.051
Hail victory!

30:47.721 --> 30:48.757
Hail victory.

30:58.398 --> 31:00.264
- Report.
- Good news.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.817
The <i>Wellenreiter's</i>
made the transition to this Earth.

31:02.903 --> 31:05.190
Kara is all that matters.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.192
That red sunlight
we're flooding her with,

31:07.282 --> 31:08.272
that's burning off.

31:09.034 --> 31:11.071
And so, pretty soon,
her cells will be so desaturated,

31:11.161 --> 31:12.493
we cannot perform the surgery.

31:12.579 --> 31:14.195
- Fix it.
- I can't.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.664
This is your city.
This is your facility.

31:17.292 --> 31:19.375
So, turn the power back on.

31:19.628 --> 31:22.371
I can't because the system
has been encrypted.

31:22.506 --> 31:23.622
By who?

31:25.050 --> 31:26.131
By Miss Smoak.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.391
Is there anything else
I could help you with?

31:43.568 --> 31:44.809
No, that'll be all.

31:45.612 --> 31:46.693
Very well.

31:51.827 --> 31:55.912
Before I go, I have something for you,
<i>Mein Führer.</i>

31:56.623 --> 31:57.613
A gift

31:58.417 --> 31:59.953
to celebrate your return.

32:02.879 --> 32:03.915
Guard!

32:15.016 --> 32:18.054
Well, I know how much you enjoy
executing rule breakers

32:18.145 --> 32:19.886
and this one has broken many of them.

32:20.272 --> 32:22.434
We discovered that there's a Jewess

32:23.233 --> 32:25.646
handing her rations
to the work camp children.

32:25.735 --> 32:28.068
Strictly against camp rules, of course.

32:32.534 --> 32:34.025
Those children were starving.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.913
Well, this must be hard.

32:47.757 --> 32:52.627
I hear your doppelganger on Earth-1
loved a woman who looks just like this.

33:04.566 --> 33:07.183
Did you really think
I would hand you a loaded weapon

33:07.277 --> 33:09.064
before verifying who you are?

33:29.633 --> 33:32.592
Hey, hey, hey. Are you okay?
No, no, no, you're fine, you're fine.

33:34.554 --> 33:36.295
Just take this and go.

33:36.640 --> 33:37.847
Why are you doing this?

33:38.308 --> 33:40.391
It's the strong's duty
to protect the weak.

33:40.477 --> 33:41.467
Take it and go.

33:41.853 --> 33:42.843
Go!

33:50.612 --> 33:51.602
Clear.

33:52.656 --> 33:53.737
How did it...

33:53.949 --> 33:55.065
Oh.

33:56.618 --> 33:59.031
Barry, we have a problem.
The gateway control's been damaged.

33:59.120 --> 34:01.362
- We can't turn it on?
- We can't turn it on here,

34:01.456 --> 34:03.448
but there should be a manual override
at the platform.

34:03.542 --> 34:06.125
All right, we're gonna have to
fight our way through.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.244
What do you mean "call it back"?

34:08.547 --> 34:09.583
Too late. It's been programmed.

34:09.672 --> 34:11.665
<i>- There's no changing course now.</i>
- You said we'd have an hour!

34:12.259 --> 34:13.750
Yeah, well, I changed my mind.

34:13.842 --> 34:15.083
The team hasn't gone
through the breach yet.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.886
That team has nothing to do with us
or saving our planet!

34:17.973 --> 34:20.636
And everyone who can threaten it is on
the other side of that breach.

34:20.725 --> 34:21.841
They're not coming back through!

34:21.935 --> 34:23.597
- General...
<i>- Leo, enough!</i>

34:23.687 --> 34:26.145
I'm not risking any more time.
We are blowing it up.

34:30.277 --> 34:31.984
<i>Guys, we have a problem.</i>

34:33.530 --> 34:35.021
What kind of problem?

34:35.156 --> 34:37.239
<i>A weapon's heading
to blow up the facility.</i>

34:38.284 --> 34:40.322
A weapon? You mean a missile?

34:40.579 --> 34:41.820
<i>Not exactly.</i>

34:54.175 --> 34:57.088
Felicity Smoak, turn the power back on.

34:57.429 --> 34:58.465
He said...

35:00.181 --> 35:01.171
Felicity!

35:03.018 --> 35:06.136
Turn the power back on.

35:06.271 --> 35:07.978
I'm sorry, Earbard. "Earbard"?

35:08.064 --> 35:09.771
- Eobard.
- Eobard.

35:09.858 --> 35:11.520
My God, the future sounds weird.

35:11.943 --> 35:13.024
It's funny.

35:13.528 --> 35:17.317
Sometimes, we think
we're more clever than we are.

35:17.991 --> 35:19.732
Because where I come from,

35:19.826 --> 35:24.912
the history books are filled
with stories of this age of heroes.

35:25.749 --> 35:26.990
Green Arrow.

35:27.584 --> 35:28.825
<i>Black Canary.</i>

35:29.085 --> 35:30.201
The Flash.

35:31.254 --> 35:32.870
And yet, no one,

35:34.090 --> 35:35.080
no one

35:35.717 --> 35:40.337
- has ever heard of "Felicity Smoak."
<i>- Stop!</i>

35:41.056 --> 35:42.763
Stop. Stop.

35:44.601 --> 35:47.093
You came here for me,
so just take me, please.

35:48.313 --> 35:49.645
Please don't hurt anyone else.

35:55.070 --> 35:56.356
Give him the code.

35:56.446 --> 35:58.233
If I do, they'll kill you.

35:58.365 --> 36:00.652
It's fine.
Nobody's gonna die because of me.

36:03.787 --> 36:06.325
Latte, Ada, Jonas,
one-one-nine-zero-zero.

36:10.251 --> 36:12.743
"Latte"? Cute.

36:29.979 --> 36:31.186
<i>Let's go.</i>

36:33.942 --> 36:36.901
In 10 minutes, Red Tornado's gonna
bring down this entire facility

36:36.986 --> 36:38.898
and there's nothing we can do
to stop that robot.

36:38.988 --> 36:41.355
Then we need to reopen the gateway
before that happens.

36:41.449 --> 36:42.439
Barry. Ray.

36:42.534 --> 36:44.651
We know. Stop a flying robot somehow.

36:44.744 --> 36:46.827
Good. The rest of us
will open the breach.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.449
That's the whole plan?

36:48.540 --> 36:50.281
Well, as the Snart we know used to say,

36:50.375 --> 36:51.991
"Make a plan. Execute the plan.

36:52.085 --> 36:53.997
"Expect the plan to go off the rails.
Throw away the plan."

36:55.004 --> 36:55.994
Wow, that is...

36:56.381 --> 36:57.588
That is terrible advice.

36:57.674 --> 36:59.415
I always have a plan,
down to the second,

36:59.509 --> 37:00.625
so nothing ever goes wrong.

37:00.719 --> 37:02.210
No, no, no, the only plan now

37:02.303 --> 37:05.387
is not to leave this Earth without me.

37:05.473 --> 37:06.463
Okay.

37:08.643 --> 37:10.726
Right. Ready for Tornado watch.

37:10.812 --> 37:11.802
Let's do it.

37:12.605 --> 37:15.188
I thought it'd be fun
if we put on our costumes.

37:19.028 --> 37:20.485
Where'd you get the bow and quiver?

37:20.572 --> 37:22.313
The General collects weapons.

37:23.700 --> 37:24.781
Let's go to war.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.288
No one gets to the gateway!

37:35.587 --> 37:36.828
No one!

38:36.439 --> 38:38.101
Here we go!

39:13.184 --> 39:14.675
Okay, we're Nazi-free. Let's go.

39:14.769 --> 39:16.431
<i>Hold on.
That's an automated power cell.</i>

39:16.521 --> 39:18.979
<i>We need to activate it
before using the control console.</i>

39:19.065 --> 39:20.727
I can hot-wire it, no problem.

39:20.817 --> 39:22.228
<i>Then I'll turn on the console.</i>

39:22.318 --> 39:24.355
Oh. You wanna split up? You sure?

39:24.445 --> 39:25.526
<i>It's our most favorable odds.</i>

39:25.947 --> 39:27.358
<i>Let's kick some ass, Jefferson.</i>

39:50.972 --> 39:52.554
Grey, we've got power!

40:06.321 --> 40:08.062
Ray?

40:09.198 --> 40:10.188
A little help here.

40:26.090 --> 40:27.251
Whoa!

40:41.105 --> 40:42.221
- Oh, crap.
- Oh, crap.

41:01.042 --> 41:02.578
Well, that's not very fair.

41:18.226 --> 41:19.433
I'm pinned down!

41:41.833 --> 41:43.699
Grey! No!
