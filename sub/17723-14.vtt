00:17.951 --> 00:19.518
Dads <i>is recorded in front</i>
<i>of a live studio audience.</i>

00:19.520 --> 00:22.621
(laughing)
Oh, what a weird movie.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.957
I know.
Vin Diesel always looks like

00:24.959 --> 00:27.526
he can't decide
what he's smelling.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.195
He's, like...

00:30.197 --> 00:32.331
Gasoline...?

00:32.333 --> 00:33.832
(sniffs)

00:33.834 --> 00:35.634
No.

00:35.636 --> 00:37.469
It's cake.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.538
Come here.

00:40.807 --> 00:42.708
(chuckles)

00:46.312 --> 00:48.414
Pretend I no here.

00:49.382 --> 00:51.016
Edna...

00:51.018 --> 00:52.718
it's okay,
you-you can go.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.486
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Eli.

00:54.488 --> 00:55.387
Thank you.

01:00.527 --> 01:02.194
Wha... E-Edna, wha...

01:02.196 --> 01:04.663
what are you doing?

01:04.665 --> 01:07.933
Tomorrow I work from home.

01:09.169 --> 01:11.236
Where were we?

01:12.338 --> 01:14.540
Eli, there's something
you should know.

01:14.542 --> 01:15.908
Uh, okay.

01:15.910 --> 01:18.343
Do you want to see
if I can guess?

01:18.345 --> 01:20.045
Maybe we both say it
at the same time.

01:20.047 --> 01:22.014
Okay, one, two...

01:22.016 --> 01:23.348
You're bisexual.
I have a son.

01:23.350 --> 01:25.184
You have a son.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.919
Yeah.

01:28.221 --> 01:30.856
If-if you want to break up,
I understand.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.591
No, no. Are you kidding?

01:32.593 --> 01:33.892
I-I love kids.

01:33.894 --> 01:38.097
Why, I would rent a baby
six times a year...

01:38.099 --> 01:40.699
if that were legal.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.201
Well, Gene is 12.

01:42.203 --> 01:45.204
Well, you know what, Elsa?
I like you.

01:45.206 --> 01:47.106
So I'm still in.

01:47.108 --> 01:48.874
(chuckles)

01:48.876 --> 01:51.276
Eli.

01:51.278 --> 01:54.213
You have company?
Yes.

01:54.215 --> 01:56.415
Is it girl company?

01:56.417 --> 01:58.383
Yes.

01:58.385 --> 02:01.153
Does she by any chance
have any Q-tips?

02:02.922 --> 02:05.224
I guess I have
to tell you...

02:05.226 --> 02:07.993
I have a dad.

02:09.929 --> 02:14.099
¶ Daddy took me to the zoo

02:14.101 --> 02:15.934
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:15.936 --> 02:20.072
¶ Just to see
something brand-new ¶

02:20.074 --> 02:22.074
¶ <i>Na, na, na, ooh</i> ¶

02:22.076 --> 02:26.979
¶ So many stars up in the sky

02:26.981 --> 02:30.916
¶ So many questions have I

02:30.918 --> 02:32.951
¶ <i>Na, na, na, na</i> ¶

02:32.953 --> 02:35.687
¶ Daddy took me for a ride.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.425
(whistling a tune)

02:40.427 --> 02:41.927
Hey.

02:41.929 --> 02:43.762
That was, uh...

02:43.764 --> 02:45.764
a beautiful woman
you had here last night.

02:45.766 --> 02:48.467
Yeah. Things are getting
kind of serious.
Mm.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.802
There's one thing
I can't figure out.

02:50.804 --> 02:53.238
Why is she with you?

02:56.109 --> 02:59.645
Well, believe it or not, Dad,
she likes my personality.

02:59.647 --> 03:01.513
No.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.348
No way that's it.

03:05.952 --> 03:07.452
Well, she's gonna
introduce me to her son.

03:07.454 --> 03:08.854
That's it.

03:09.789 --> 03:12.124
Okay, now it makes sense.

03:12.126 --> 03:13.959
Little piece of advice,

03:13.961 --> 03:16.795
take it or leave it.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.931
Run...!

03:24.003 --> 03:26.071
(Crawford screams)

03:28.174 --> 03:30.542
Wh-What?

03:30.544 --> 03:32.211
Oh, nothing.
My doctor says

03:32.213 --> 03:34.346
I should make a noise
every few minutes

03:34.348 --> 03:37.482
to make sure
I'm still alive.

03:37.484 --> 03:38.850
Hey, hey.
Hey.

03:38.852 --> 03:39.885
Easy-E!

03:39.887 --> 03:41.153
E-Dog!

03:41.155 --> 03:42.788
¶ Eli-Eli-Oh!

03:44.891 --> 03:46.391
Are you on something?

03:46.393 --> 03:48.994
No. I'm just on the couch.

03:48.996 --> 03:51.063
I got into a fight
last night with Camila.

03:51.065 --> 03:52.598
(chuckles):
It was great.

03:53.900 --> 03:55.534
I never realized
how comfortable

03:55.536 --> 03:58.003
my couch was.
I haven't slept that good

03:58.005 --> 04:01.240
since I was in a coma
for two days.

04:01.242 --> 04:04.009
(laughs):
I feel so alive.

04:04.011 --> 04:05.410
(screams)

04:05.412 --> 04:07.746
Me, too.

04:07.748 --> 04:10.382
So, did you go out
last night?

04:10.384 --> 04:12.017
Yeah, yeah,
I had another date with Elsa.

04:12.019 --> 04:13.518
It's actually getting
kind of serious.

04:13.520 --> 04:15.687
Wow, number three--
the Third Date Kid.

04:15.689 --> 04:18.056
Yeah, it's good; we're, like,
texting all the time.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.858
It's all, like...
(high-pitched): Bwoo, boo,

04:19.860 --> 04:21.860
bwoo, boo, bwoo-bwoo,

04:21.862 --> 04:24.329
bwoo-bwoo, boo, boo, boo.

04:25.398 --> 04:26.932
Well, I keep my phone
on vibrate.

04:26.934 --> 04:31.069
Ooh, wh... <i>where</i> do you keep
your phone on vibrate?

04:31.071 --> 04:35.274
In a manila folder with
a sexual harassment complaint.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.777
Actually, you guys
can help me.

04:38.779 --> 04:40.045
Elsa has a 12-year-old son.

04:40.047 --> 04:41.213
I'm supposed
to meet him tonight.

04:41.215 --> 04:45.550
Just do your Grover voice:
Hey, kid, how's it goin'?

04:45.552 --> 04:47.419
I'm serious, though--
this is a kid

04:47.421 --> 04:50.722
being raised by a single mom
with no dad.

04:50.724 --> 04:53.091
This is me.
I can help this kid.

04:53.093 --> 04:55.894
Yes! Yes! Eli to the rescue.

04:55.896 --> 04:57.896
I love Energized Warner.

04:57.898 --> 04:59.064
This is great.

04:59.066 --> 05:00.799
Hey, you know,
we got that meeting

05:00.801 --> 05:02.901
with the big-box retailers
this week-- maybe you want

05:02.903 --> 05:05.570
to pick a fight with Camila,
sleep on the couch all week.

05:05.572 --> 05:06.905
(laughs):
That's ridiculous.

05:06.907 --> 05:09.107
I'm not gonna just
pick a fight for no reason.

05:09.109 --> 05:10.642
Look at the way
this towel is folded,

05:10.644 --> 05:12.911
and look at the way
this towel is folded.

05:12.913 --> 05:14.746
So?

05:14.748 --> 05:17.282
So, you used two different
folding techniques.

05:17.284 --> 05:19.117
One t... one towel's square

05:19.119 --> 05:20.419
while the other one's
a rectangle.

05:20.421 --> 05:21.953
What kind of country
are we living in,

05:21.955 --> 05:24.756
Crazy-stan?!

05:24.758 --> 05:26.958
I don't know what
your problem is tonight,

05:26.960 --> 05:28.927
but I'm gonna go
sleep on the couch.

05:28.929 --> 05:30.128
Oh, no, no, no, no!

05:30.130 --> 05:32.097
No, no, no, no, I'm gonna
sleep on the couch.

05:32.099 --> 05:33.098
No, I...
Nuh...

05:33.100 --> 05:33.932
You know what? Fine.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.001
Okay.
Okay.

05:36.003 --> 05:38.070
¶

05:42.508 --> 05:43.942
Mm.
So, Gene,

05:43.944 --> 05:46.011
tell Eli about
your school.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.749
I go to a school.

05:51.951 --> 05:53.685
He's a little shy
with strangers.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.587
Let me just get dessert.

06:00.293 --> 06:03.362
(like Grover):
So, what's up, buddy!

06:07.300 --> 06:09.501
Hey, uh, do you like
skateboarding?

06:09.503 --> 06:12.003
Man, I loved skateboarding
when I was your age,

06:12.005 --> 06:14.473
mostly 'cause
of <i>Back to the Future.</i>

06:14.475 --> 06:17.209
I've never heard of that.

06:17.211 --> 06:20.145
I'm not a thousand.

06:20.147 --> 06:22.547
Uh, do you like video games?

06:22.549 --> 06:23.482
I guess.

06:23.484 --> 06:24.649
Oh, cool.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.151
You should come
to my office, Ghost Child Games.

06:26.153 --> 06:27.319
Ghost Child?

06:27.321 --> 06:29.788
All your games suck.

06:31.491 --> 06:33.024
Listen, Gene...

06:33.026 --> 06:35.994
I know how hard it is
to grow up without a dad.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.164
So that's why all
your games suck?

06:39.166 --> 06:41.533
No, I'm just...
I'm saying that...

06:41.535 --> 06:44.069
like, if you ever
want someone to talk to,

06:44.071 --> 06:45.170
I'm here for you.

06:45.172 --> 06:49.007
Is everyone else in
the world but you dead?

06:49.009 --> 06:50.008
(chuckles softly)

06:50.010 --> 06:51.176
Come on, come on, buddy,

06:51.178 --> 06:53.078
I'm just...
I'm just trying to connect.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.884
Oop! Oop!

06:58.886 --> 07:00.385
What? I'm just
trying to connect

07:00.387 --> 07:03.422
my fist with your face.

07:03.424 --> 07:06.024
Uh, what are you...
Hey, hey...

07:06.026 --> 07:07.592
(nervous laugh)

07:08.761 --> 07:10.429
Are you and
my mom doing it?

07:10.431 --> 07:12.764
(laughs):
Uh, Ge...

07:12.766 --> 07:14.199
Gene...

07:14.201 --> 07:17.369
that is wildly inappropriate.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.971
You know I came out of
there 12 years ago.

07:22.108 --> 07:25.377
I was nine pounds
and 18 inches.

07:25.379 --> 07:28.146
What are you?

07:37.256 --> 07:40.025
Less, obviously.

07:46.232 --> 07:48.266
MAN:
Are you sick of high prices

07:48.268 --> 07:50.969
and parking lots
you can't land a plane in?

07:50.971 --> 07:53.104
I'm Ken.
I'm Jim.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.640
And this is
Texas Big Box!
Texas!

07:55.642 --> 07:58.310
We got the lowest
prices in all of...
Texas!

07:58.312 --> 08:00.779
Are you sick
of Mom and Pop's
high prices?

08:00.781 --> 08:01.980
Well, so are we.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.748
Scram!

08:03.750 --> 08:05.317
Go on! You git!

08:07.320 --> 08:09.921
Just in case they didn't die
in the wheelchair crash.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.157
We're offering
Texas-sized values

08:12.159 --> 08:14.259
at Rhode Island-
sized prices.

08:14.261 --> 08:16.495
Look at that little
twerp state, Rhode Island.

08:16.497 --> 08:17.929
(squeaky voice):
"I'm Rhode Island."

08:17.931 --> 08:19.931
Get off my country!

08:19.933 --> 08:21.666
Whoo-hoo!

08:21.668 --> 08:22.934
So whether
you're looking

08:22.936 --> 08:25.337
for shrimp or
a basketball court,

08:25.339 --> 08:27.439
you come on down
to Texas Big Box!

08:27.441 --> 08:29.508
Texas!
Whoo-hoo!

08:31.110 --> 08:32.811
Texas!

08:32.813 --> 08:35.113
They seem like jerks.

08:35.115 --> 08:37.115
Jerks that
can make us rich.

08:37.117 --> 08:39.017
(laughs):
Why are you being so negative?

08:40.152 --> 08:45.123
(sighs) Last night
I met Elsa's son, and...

08:45.125 --> 08:48.126
he bullied me.
(Veronica laughing)

08:48.128 --> 08:51.830
No way! Is he single?

08:51.832 --> 08:54.132
I'm serious.
Like, he almost punched me.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.634
Well, did you
almost punch him back?

08:55.636 --> 08:58.169
No! I can't hit a 12-year-old.

08:58.171 --> 09:01.506
His mom would <i>never </i>
<i>sleep with me again.</i>

09:01.508 --> 09:03.975
(both laughing)

09:03.977 --> 09:05.644
I'm gonna go watch
<i>The Karate Kid.</i>

09:05.646 --> 09:07.512
Uh, no, you are not.

09:07.514 --> 09:09.147
You are gonna go and test out

09:09.149 --> 09:10.315
the    <i>Hockey Death Mat</i>prototype
for tomorrow's meeting.

09:10.317 --> 09:11.983
(whining):
I don't want to.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.053
(gasps) All right,
all right, yes, ma'am.

09:16.556 --> 09:19.224
God, that was good.
I can't eat another bite.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.826
Oh, thank you. I spent almost
ten minutes ordering it.

09:21.828 --> 09:23.662
(laughs)

09:23.664 --> 09:25.030
Um...

09:25.032 --> 09:28.833
Hey, Elsa, has... has Gene been
having any trouble in school?

09:28.835 --> 09:32.671
What do you mean?
Well, I don't know
how to tell you this, but he...

09:32.673 --> 09:35.740
I mean, your son...
bullied me.

09:36.709 --> 09:38.410
What?

09:38.412 --> 09:42.080
Yeah, the other night at dinner,
he... he almost punched me.

09:42.082 --> 09:43.848
I don't know,

09:43.850 --> 09:45.750
I think he needs
to talk to somebody,

09:45.752 --> 09:47.852
like a therapist or maybe a...

09:47.854 --> 09:51.022
priest with no penis,
so there's no funny business.

09:51.024 --> 09:54.192
Okay, listen, if you're
not man enough to be with me

09:54.194 --> 09:56.561
because I have a son, fine,
Wha...?

09:56.563 --> 09:59.598
but don't just invent things
that are wrong with him.

09:59.600 --> 10:04.369
Oh... oh, don't go into
thing-gathering mode.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.937
Oh, I am gathering.

10:05.939 --> 10:07.939
What? Come on.
And by the way...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.610
...your sex face is stupid.

10:14.080 --> 10:17.649
Yeah, well, the back
of your head is stupid!

10:21.787 --> 10:23.288
Hi.
Hey.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.542
Where is she?

10:45.945 --> 10:48.913
Oh, I'm on to your little plan.

10:48.915 --> 10:52.484
Faking fights
so you can sleep on the couch.

10:53.586 --> 10:57.589
(weakly):
Wh-what are you talking about?

10:57.591 --> 10:59.824
CAMILA:
<i>When we got in that fight</i>
<i>last night,</i>

10:59.826 --> 11:01.426
<i>you made one little mistake.</i>

11:01.428 --> 11:03.428
You left your day planner open,
<i>and it said,</i>

11:03.430 --> 11:06.431
<i>"Fake fight with Camila</i>
<i>so I can sleep on couch."</i>

11:06.433 --> 11:07.932
<i>It's the paper trail.</i>

11:07.934 --> 11:10.602
<i>The paper trail, you fool.</i>

11:10.604 --> 11:11.970
So now...

11:11.972 --> 11:13.605
we're in a real fight.

11:13.607 --> 11:15.106
I'm gonna go to bed.

11:15.108 --> 11:16.141
These are yours.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.342
Good night.

11:22.481 --> 11:26.117
Warner... Warner, will
you stop wiggling?

11:26.119 --> 11:28.520
That's just
what your mother used to do,

11:28.522 --> 11:32.624
up all night with her stomach
pills and her heart pills.

11:32.626 --> 11:35.960
She had acute angina.

11:35.962 --> 11:39.197
Yeah, she sure did.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.738
(shouts)
(shouts)

11:47.973 --> 11:49.974
Thank you.
Oh, you're welcome.

11:49.976 --> 11:51.976
(phone chimes)

11:51.978 --> 11:55.547
Oh. Looks like Elsa
wants to make up with me.

11:55.549 --> 11:57.716
(phone chimes)
Oh.

11:57.718 --> 11:59.551
And it looks like she...

11:59.553 --> 12:01.619
Oh, wow.

12:02.555 --> 12:05.890
Oh, wow. Okay. Uh...

12:05.892 --> 12:07.492
Uh, hey, would you guys,

12:07.494 --> 12:11.896
uh, get out of here and maybe
not come back for an hour?

12:11.898 --> 12:13.898
Could you guys... could you guys
just split, like, for a sec?

12:13.900 --> 12:15.567
Just g-get out...
like, get out of the house

12:15.569 --> 12:18.002
and then, like, not-not
come back for an hour?

12:18.004 --> 12:19.904
Just... Would you get out?!

12:20.840 --> 12:21.906
Come on, Edna.

12:21.908 --> 12:23.842
Let's go down
to the computer store and see

12:23.844 --> 12:28.046
if we can ask so many questions
the guy quits.

12:28.048 --> 12:29.848
What is computer?

12:29.850 --> 12:31.950
That'll be our first question.

12:33.853 --> 12:35.920
(door shuts)

12:45.264 --> 12:47.332
(knocking)

12:48.901 --> 12:50.435
Damn it.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.906
(exhales)

12:54.908 --> 12:57.375
Uh...

12:57.377 --> 12:58.877
Hey, Gene. Uh...

12:58.879 --> 12:59.911
where's your mom?

12:59.913 --> 13:01.379
I borrowed her phone.

13:01.381 --> 13:05.183
So congratulations,
you just sexted a 12-year-old.

13:07.787 --> 13:10.054
(chuckles)
Come in.

13:10.056 --> 13:11.623
So...

13:11.625 --> 13:14.559
give me $100.

13:14.561 --> 13:17.929
What? Your mom and I aren't
even dating anymore.

13:17.931 --> 13:20.365
(mockingly): "Your mom and I
aren't even dating anymore."

13:21.400 --> 13:22.901
Okay.

13:22.903 --> 13:26.905
(sighs) Gene, I know that being
a kid can be tough.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.240
You know, you've got all
this anger and emotion.

13:29.242 --> 13:31.576
You don't know how
to express yourself.

13:31.578 --> 13:34.913
But being a bully,
that's not the answer.

13:34.915 --> 13:36.147
You're right.

13:36.149 --> 13:38.483
I guess I'm just sad
because my dad left.

13:39.451 --> 13:41.252
See? I totally get that.

13:41.254 --> 13:42.420
Can we talk about it?

13:42.422 --> 13:43.454
Absolutely.

13:43.456 --> 13:45.123
Can I have a glass
of apple juice first?

13:45.125 --> 13:46.457
Yes, of course you can.

13:46.459 --> 13:50.128
What single guy
doesn't have apple juice?

13:50.130 --> 13:53.097
Uh, let me see. I
got some water, an OJ,

13:53.099 --> 13:55.099
almond milk, soy milk,

13:55.101 --> 13:57.936
chocolate soy milk,
vanilla soy milk,

13:57.938 --> 13:58.937
coconut milk,
actual milk,

13:58.939 --> 14:01.773
Bloody Mary mix,

14:01.775 --> 14:03.441
clam juice--
ew, thank you, Dad--

14:03.443 --> 14:06.110
uh, tonic, pickle juice.

14:06.112 --> 14:07.946
Oh, here it is.
One apple juice coming up.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.014
Get ready. Catch.

14:13.953 --> 14:16.020
Gene?

14:18.123 --> 14:20.191
Wh...

14:21.327 --> 14:23.127
Oh, my G...

14:23.129 --> 14:25.129
My jacket.
DAVID:
I'm not looking.

14:25.131 --> 14:27.198
I just forgot my glasses.

14:29.535 --> 14:30.969
Dad, the...

14:30.971 --> 14:33.304
the prototype to our game--
it was in my jacket.

14:33.306 --> 14:35.740
That-that little bastard,
he just stole it!

14:36.709 --> 14:39.277
"He"?

14:40.980 --> 14:44.048
Elsa's a guy?

14:49.989 --> 14:52.056
Your son is bullying

14:52.058 --> 14:55.026
my son.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.061
Well, your son is a liar.

14:57.063 --> 14:58.329
What? No, I'm not.

14:58.331 --> 15:01.165
You said, "This usually
doesn't happen."

15:01.167 --> 15:04.068
And then it happened.

15:05.404 --> 15:07.906
Your son took my son's game

15:07.908 --> 15:09.741
<i>and</i> his jacket.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.509
I need that game.
It's my only copy.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.177
I need it
for a big meeting tomorrow.

15:13.179 --> 15:15.079
He's lying. He <i>gave</i> me those.

15:15.081 --> 15:17.849
Well, that's that.

15:17.851 --> 15:20.685
Wha...
Don't make me get
stern with you.

15:20.687 --> 15:22.020
Don't make me
get stern...

15:22.022 --> 15:23.855
Hey!
...with you!

15:23.857 --> 15:26.591
(screams):
Ow!

15:28.193 --> 15:30.261
(hisses, exhales)

15:32.932 --> 15:35.433
Single moms have become
a lot more dangerous

15:35.435 --> 15:38.503
since I used to leave 'em.

15:39.438 --> 15:41.506
Hey.

15:45.878 --> 15:46.945
Wake up.

15:46.947 --> 15:48.880
Sorry. I had to sleep
with my dad last night

15:48.882 --> 15:50.448
and he, uh...
he was having a dream.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.718
He kept yelling,
"Pick me, pick me, pick me."

15:53.720 --> 15:57.088
Well, they wouldn't pick me,
and I wanted them to.

15:57.090 --> 15:58.056
Well, they didn't!

15:58.058 --> 16:00.124
Because I'm white.

16:02.628 --> 16:03.962
So did you get the game?

16:03.964 --> 16:05.964
Nope. And it just goes to show,

16:05.966 --> 16:07.598
when me and my dad
work together,

16:07.600 --> 16:10.068
there is nothing we can do.

16:10.070 --> 16:11.102
VERONICA:
Look, we can't give up.

16:11.104 --> 16:12.070
Give me your phone.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.305
There.
Oh.

16:16.108 --> 16:18.943
Hi. Gene? This is Veronica.

16:18.945 --> 16:21.412
I work for your mom's
loser ex-boyfriend.

16:21.414 --> 16:24.148
So, what's it gonna take for you
to bring this game down here

16:24.150 --> 16:25.416
in the next 15 minutes?

16:25.418 --> 16:27.919
Ice cream? Stuffed animals?

16:27.921 --> 16:30.922
You got boobs?

16:30.924 --> 16:32.256
What?

16:32.258 --> 16:37.261
Do... you...
have... boobs?

16:37.263 --> 16:39.163
Y-Yeah.

16:39.165 --> 16:40.832
Describe them.

16:40.834 --> 16:44.168
De... Well...

16:44.170 --> 16:47.939
Well, to me, they're
just boring nothings.

16:47.941 --> 16:50.842
No, they're not.

16:50.844 --> 16:52.910
They're boobs.

16:54.947 --> 16:56.981
Listen-- why don't I
come over there

16:56.983 --> 16:59.317
and show them to you if
you give me back that game.

16:59.319 --> 17:01.953
Can I invite friends?

17:01.955 --> 17:03.955
No. I'll be right over.

17:03.957 --> 17:04.956
(phone beeps off)

17:04.958 --> 17:06.290
What happened?

17:06.292 --> 17:07.358
I have a plan.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.693
Howdy, boys.

17:08.695 --> 17:09.794
Stall them.

17:09.796 --> 17:11.629
Hope you don't mind us
being early,

17:11.631 --> 17:13.998
but we finished seeing
everything in San Francisco.

17:14.000 --> 17:15.133
Oh, yeah.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.335
Yeah, we saw a bridge,
a twisty street

17:17.337 --> 17:19.971
and a gay fella.

17:19.973 --> 17:21.305
That-that about covers it.

17:21.307 --> 17:23.307
(nervous laugh)

17:23.309 --> 17:26.310
So, can we get a look
at this new game?

17:26.312 --> 17:28.479
Oh, yes. Uh, soon.
It's just, um...

17:28.481 --> 17:30.014
r-rendering.

17:30.016 --> 17:33.651
(chuckles) I don't understand
all your fancy computer terms.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.987
That's why God created nerds!

17:35.989 --> 17:38.056
(guffawing)

17:40.025 --> 17:41.993
ELI:
I-It'll...

17:41.995 --> 17:43.194
it'll only take a minute.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.830
Things have really slowed down
around here...

17:45.832 --> 17:48.766
because of... Obamacare.

17:53.205 --> 17:55.139
Are you wearing cologne?

17:56.175 --> 17:58.009
(doorbell rings)

17:58.011 --> 17:59.210
Get out!

17:59.212 --> 18:00.344
Get out, get out.

18:00.346 --> 18:01.345
Get out!

18:01.347 --> 18:02.146
No.

18:06.351 --> 18:07.718
Wow.

18:07.720 --> 18:11.055
Those are not boring nothings.

18:11.057 --> 18:12.190
Give me game.

18:12.192 --> 18:13.724
Wait, you're not the lady

18:13.726 --> 18:14.859
I talked to on the phone.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.727
Veronica send me instead.

18:16.729 --> 18:18.029
Aren't you Eli's maid?

18:18.031 --> 18:20.064
<i>Sí. </i>
<i>I think you should leave.</i>

18:20.066 --> 18:21.933
Not without game.

18:21.935 --> 18:26.737
Eli gave that game
to my...

18:26.739 --> 18:28.840
son.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.376
Now...

18:32.378 --> 18:34.378
we can do this easy way

18:34.380 --> 18:38.616
or Easy Oven way.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.552
We are not giving you anything.

18:41.554 --> 18:45.990
(screaming)

18:47.392 --> 18:49.460
This place is a mess.

18:55.601 --> 18:57.068
If you need maid,

18:57.070 --> 18:59.704
I free on Tuesday and Thursdays.

19:07.312 --> 19:10.414
So, that is
Hockey Death Match.

19:10.416 --> 19:11.749
What do you think?

19:11.751 --> 19:12.817
We love it.

19:12.819 --> 19:14.252
That's great,
great, great.

19:14.254 --> 19:16.087
Um, so how many units?

19:16.089 --> 19:17.088
All of 'em.

19:17.090 --> 19:19.290
Really?
Oh.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.759
Uh, b-but we always
hold back some production

19:21.761 --> 19:23.427
for the independent
game shops.

19:23.429 --> 19:25.596
Those are the guys we're
trying to put out of business.

19:25.598 --> 19:27.165
JIM:
Independent game shops.

19:27.167 --> 19:29.433
We want to stomp
on the little guys' throats

19:29.435 --> 19:32.937
and then urinate
into their faces.

19:32.939 --> 19:34.972
But they helped put
our company on the map.

19:34.974 --> 19:38.442
You know, I-I...
Yeah, it's... if you urinate
on the independent game shops,

19:38.444 --> 19:41.145
that's like urinating
on us, and I'm not...

19:41.147 --> 19:42.680
WARNER:
Yeah. Yeah.

19:42.682 --> 19:46.684
I'm not gonna let anybody
urinate on me. No.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.753
Not again.

19:50.956 --> 19:53.191
Well, those are the terms.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.959
Go ahead and...

19:54.961 --> 19:57.161
sign these papers.

19:57.163 --> 20:00.131
You know what?
I'm sorry. We...

20:00.133 --> 20:01.966
we have to turn you down.

20:01.968 --> 20:04.135
Excuse me?

20:04.137 --> 20:07.305
Yeah, you...
you guys are bullies.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.307
And I'm tired
of being pushed around.

20:09.309 --> 20:12.343
I've been bullied
all week.

20:12.345 --> 20:14.812
By who?

20:14.814 --> 20:16.847
By a 12-year-old
and his single mom,

20:16.849 --> 20:18.549
but that's not important.
What is im...

20:18.551 --> 20:20.017
what is important
is that

20:20.019 --> 20:23.554
someone needs to...
stand up and do what's right.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.057
Gentlemen, we're
getting off track.

20:26.059 --> 20:27.825
We love your game.

20:27.827 --> 20:31.028
What's it gonna take for us
to get it up on our shelves?

20:31.030 --> 20:33.364
You know what?
Forget it.

20:33.366 --> 20:35.066
$2 million.

20:39.338 --> 20:41.072
$3 million.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.844
$4 million.
ELI:
Oh, my gosh.

20:46.846 --> 20:49.547
Stop offering us money.
Stop it.

20:49.549 --> 20:54.518
You boys drive a hard bargain,
and I respect that.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.687
We'll be back
in six months.

20:56.689 --> 20:58.689
We got a great
spot opening up

20:58.691 --> 21:02.159
right between tampons
and fried chicken.

21:06.031 --> 21:08.032
Oh, this is so great.

21:08.034 --> 21:10.401
A real bed.

21:10.403 --> 21:12.937
Oh, honey, thank you
for letting me back in.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.106
Yeah, well, you were
a complete jerk, but...

21:15.108 --> 21:17.575
I know you were working hard
to get that deal.

21:17.577 --> 21:19.910
Yeah, the deal, the deal.
They, uh...

21:19.912 --> 21:23.080
It went great. They-they wanted
to buy our whole inventory.

21:23.082 --> 21:25.549
This is amazing!

21:25.551 --> 21:27.618
Are you kidding me?
That's great.
Yeah, yeah.

21:27.620 --> 21:30.921
(gasps) Now we can afford
to get your dad his own place.

21:30.923 --> 21:32.723
Well, actually, we-we, uh...

21:32.725 --> 21:34.659
we-we had to turn them down.

21:39.798 --> 21:42.400
Warner? Warner...

21:42.402 --> 21:44.869
They picked me.
