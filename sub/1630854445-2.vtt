00:15.140 --> 00:18.101
Jude, I… I have to tell you something.

00:18.184 --> 00:19.811
Um…

00:19.894 --> 00:23.189
And I shouldn't have to be the bearer
of this because…

00:23.273 --> 00:24.607
Blech! It's, um…

00:25.442 --> 00:26.484
It's hard.

00:27.652 --> 00:29.821
But I love you so much,

00:29.904 --> 00:34.242
and whatever happens
we are in this together, okay?

00:36.786 --> 00:39.873
But there are shadows in your scans

00:40.415 --> 00:41.624
that they found.

00:41.708 --> 00:44.127
And-- and,
you know, it's probably nothing.

00:45.378 --> 00:46.921
But you probably have cancer!

00:47.005 --> 00:48.381
And you're gonna fucking die!

00:48.465 --> 00:49.549
-What?

00:49.632 --> 00:51.676
-Nothing!
-Were you talking to me?

00:51.760 --> 00:53.094
-'Cause I didn't hear.
-Nope!

00:53.178 --> 00:56.264
-Do you need me?
-No! Jesus, Judy, no!

01:06.816 --> 01:10.820
Judy, how are you chin-deep
in cupcakes already?

01:10.904 --> 01:11.738
We just got home.

01:11.821 --> 01:14.032
It's still Charlie's birthday.
It's the least I can do.

01:14.115 --> 01:16.076
You know your least
is better than my best.

01:16.159 --> 01:17.410
Thanks.

01:17.494 --> 01:19.537
It's vanilla chocolate chip
with a caramel ganache.

01:20.121 --> 01:21.664
Why wouldn't it be?

01:21.748 --> 01:24.084
Hey, Jude, um, can you sit down for a sec?

01:24.167 --> 01:25.919
I-I just need to talk to you.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.713
Yeah, of course.
I know, we have to talk about it.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.840
-Which part?
-That's Steve's been found.

01:31.424 --> 01:33.885
Oh… Yeah, right.

01:33.968 --> 01:35.470
I mean, is it terrifying? Yeah.

01:35.553 --> 01:38.223
Have I been having
low-grade diarrhea about it? Sure I have.

01:38.306 --> 01:40.517
-You have?
-Yeah. It's nervous poops.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.977
But I have to tell you,
I've been thinking about it,

01:43.061 --> 01:44.604
and it might not be the worst thing.

01:45.355 --> 01:46.981
No, that's true.

01:47.065 --> 01:48.191
When we were at the hospital,

01:48.274 --> 01:50.527
kept having this feeling
like another shoe was gonna drop.

01:50.610 --> 01:53.238
Though I never understood why
it's a shoe or why it's dropping.

01:53.321 --> 01:54.697
Maybe that's a regional thing.

01:54.781 --> 01:57.700
Anyway, I was afraid <i>you</i> were the shoe.

01:57.784 --> 02:00.370
Wait. Me? How-- how am I the shoe?

02:00.453 --> 02:01.788
Because of your injuries.

02:01.871 --> 02:04.541
-And you were the only shoe that I had.
-Okay.

02:04.624 --> 02:08.795
But then when Ben told me about Steve,
I was like, "Ooh, there it is."

02:08.878 --> 02:10.380
So Steve's the shoe?

02:10.463 --> 02:11.548
Right.

02:11.631 --> 02:14.092
-I know you're worried. Rightly so.
-Mm-hmm.

02:14.175 --> 02:16.719
Natural response.
But maybe this is a good thing.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.180
How could it be good?

02:19.264 --> 02:21.641
Because we don't have to worry
about the Steve shoe dropping,

02:21.724 --> 02:24.894
which was a lot of stress to keep inside.
It's not healthy.

02:24.978 --> 02:26.146
You're right. It's not.

02:26.229 --> 02:29.315
And now Ben and his family
can finally get closure.

02:29.399 --> 02:30.275
That's true.

02:30.859 --> 02:32.819
So, the way I see it,

02:33.486 --> 02:35.864
it's really kind of a relief
more than anything.

02:36.573 --> 02:37.907
Um,

02:39.075 --> 02:40.577
Jude, I--

02:40.660 --> 02:41.744
Yeah.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.042
I need to…

02:52.172 --> 02:54.883
…have wine. Do you want some wine?

02:54.966 --> 02:56.926
-Yeah, of course.
-And another pain pill.

02:57.010 --> 02:59.387
-Yeah. Should I get some weed?
-Yes.

03:00.263 --> 03:02.390
Let's grab all the numbing agents.

03:09.022 --> 03:10.648
Why does this not--

03:10.732 --> 03:11.608
Just--

03:12.650 --> 03:14.277
-Jen!
-What?

03:21.868 --> 03:23.119
Hey, what's up?

03:23.203 --> 03:25.872
Oh, hi. Here's the birthday boy.

03:26.539 --> 03:28.374
-Did you kill Steve Wood?

03:29.667 --> 03:30.501
What?

03:31.836 --> 03:33.796
I read the letters that you wrote us.

03:36.424 --> 03:39.677
Um, honey, I--

03:39.761 --> 03:43.348
All right. I can explain.

03:43.431 --> 03:44.682
Explain what?

03:44.766 --> 03:47.060
You torched Steve's car
because you were afraid the cops

03:47.143 --> 03:48.353
were gonna find out you had it?

03:48.436 --> 03:52.065
-What? No.
-Stop fucking lying!

03:52.148 --> 03:54.692
You wrote us fucking goodbye letters!

03:54.776 --> 03:56.736
-Honey.
-And really?

03:56.819 --> 03:59.113
You were gonna leave us
with this fucking weasel?

03:59.197 --> 04:01.699
After what happened with Dad?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.284
You told him?

04:04.410 --> 04:05.870
Did I?

04:05.954 --> 04:07.038
Oh, my God.

04:08.206 --> 04:09.207
Charlie.

04:09.832 --> 04:11.292
I am so sorry.

04:11.376 --> 04:14.796
I was gonna tell you one day.
I just, I…

04:14.879 --> 04:16.756
-I didn't mean--
-You didn't mean to what?

04:17.340 --> 04:18.758
Destroy our family?

04:20.260 --> 04:22.845
I hope fucking my dad was worth it.

04:23.972 --> 04:24.931
-What?
-What?

04:25.014 --> 04:29.102
And I don't know if you're protecting her
or getting back at her or what.

04:29.185 --> 04:33.314
All I know is that guy is dead,
and you look guilty as fuck.

04:36.859 --> 04:39.320
God, Charlie. 

04:40.113 --> 04:41.030
I can't--

04:43.366 --> 04:47.954
I can't believe that you would think
I was capable of something like that.

04:48.705 --> 04:51.249
You really think
that I am that much of a monster?

04:52.166 --> 04:53.167
Yeah, kinda.

04:54.919 --> 04:55.962
No, honey.

04:58.339 --> 05:02.176
Do you wanna know the real reason
why I lit that car on fire?

05:03.052 --> 05:04.429
I want the truth.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.101
So you deserve that.

05:12.729 --> 05:15.523
Have you ever heard
of the Greek Mafia?

05:15.606 --> 05:18.109
-More of a syndicate, really.
-A sy-din-dicate<i>,</i> yeah.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.653
-What?
-Well, Steve was involved.

05:20.737 --> 05:22.488
-Peripherally.
-Peripheral…

05:22.572 --> 05:26.117
With the Greeks.
And, uh, he laundered money from them--

05:26.200 --> 05:27.994
-And he stole from them.
-He did what?

05:28.077 --> 05:30.496
-Millions. Honest. Go ahead.
-Are you fucking kidding me?

05:31.080 --> 05:35.084
Anyway, he wanted me to hide his car,

05:35.168 --> 05:38.713
and I-I didn't know what to do,
so I put it in our storage and…

05:39.297 --> 05:43.051
Well, then you found it,
and I was terrified

05:43.134 --> 05:47.138
that bad people
were gonna… track it back to us.

05:47.221 --> 05:48.181
So,

05:48.848 --> 05:50.183
I had to light it on fire.

05:50.266 --> 05:51.351
Desperate times.

05:51.434 --> 05:54.437
-But after that, I went to the police.
-She did. That's true.

05:54.520 --> 05:58.191
And they completely understood
how innocent I was in all of this.

05:58.274 --> 05:59.150
Okay.

05:59.734 --> 06:03.279
But why did you need
to forgive Judy for Dad, then?

06:03.863 --> 06:06.491
Okay, that's a different story.

06:07.033 --> 06:09.535
She fucked him. You were right about that.

06:09.619 --> 06:11.704
She had an affair with Dad.

06:11.788 --> 06:14.499
And, um, yeah, I-I forgave her.

06:15.208 --> 06:16.959
She just seemed really sorry.

06:17.043 --> 06:18.753
Oh, yeah, I was. I mean, I am.

06:18.836 --> 06:21.547
-I'm just, uh… I'm so sorry.
-Yeah.

06:21.631 --> 06:24.634
So you see, there's
an explanation for everything, honey.

06:25.218 --> 06:27.470
Now, can you please give me the gun?

06:28.054 --> 06:30.264
Please give me the gun.
Don't point it at me!

06:30.348 --> 06:32.350
-Put it down.
-Down, like scissors.

06:32.433 --> 06:33.601
Okay. Thanks.

06:41.484 --> 06:44.112
Where's the bird
that was in there?

06:45.154 --> 06:47.156
I gave it back to Henry.
It's his, isn't it?

06:47.865 --> 06:49.867
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

06:58.084 --> 06:59.502
Why are you doing this?

07:00.044 --> 07:03.131
It's part of the game.
At first, it feels like you're a hostage.

07:03.214 --> 07:05.842
And then you end up liking it,
and never wanting to leave.

07:06.759 --> 07:08.678
Wait, not that. I just got it back.

07:08.761 --> 07:11.097
Sorry. I have to confiscate
all personal items.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.850
What happened to its tail?

07:14.434 --> 07:16.561
-It broke, I guess.
-Can I keep it?

07:16.644 --> 07:18.479
I collect things that are broken.

07:19.063 --> 07:20.648
Like my dad's promises.

07:20.731 --> 07:22.358
-Oh.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.820
Shandy, are you playing
Stockholm Syndrome again?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.657
-Not everyone idolizes Patty Hearst.
-Mm. No, it's okay.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.201
-I like it.
-It's working.

07:33.494 --> 07:34.495
Okay.

07:36.330 --> 07:38.458
Just make sure you clear his nose.

07:38.541 --> 07:40.209
If he passes out, I have to tell Jen.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.253
And I don't
wanna get on her bad side.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.720
I can't believe you told him
about the fucking letters.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.223
Oh, I can't believe you let him believe
that I was fucking Ted.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.392
Now he hates me
and not for the reason that he should.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.436
Well, I don't want him to know
why he should.

07:58.519 --> 08:00.396
It's not gonna make him hate you any less

08:00.480 --> 08:02.940
if he knew how
you actually fucked his father. I'm sorry.

08:03.024 --> 08:06.110
It's okay. I just-- I hate lying to him.

08:06.194 --> 08:09.822
Yeah, well, you know, sometimes
the-- the truth just hurts more, so…

08:09.906 --> 08:12.325
The way he looked at me,
it was like he wanted me to die.

08:12.408 --> 08:15.328
No, no one wants you to die.
Okay? Don't say that.

08:15.870 --> 08:17.246
Just-- he'll be fine.

08:17.955 --> 08:21.042
Just give him the car
and then all will be forgiven.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.253
-Feels a little transactional.
-Well, that's the great thing about kids.

08:24.337 --> 08:25.463
They can be bought.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.341
-Do you think he believed us?
-I think so.

08:28.424 --> 08:31.427
I mean, it does make you wonder
if he could figure all that out…

08:31.511 --> 08:33.804
-I mean, how hard would it be--
-I know.

08:35.598 --> 08:36.557
Mm.

08:39.310 --> 08:40.478
-Hmm!

08:40.561 --> 08:42.480
Oh, hi, look who it is!

08:42.563 --> 08:44.065
-Yeah.
-It's the police.

08:44.148 --> 08:45.566
-Great.
-Our police.

08:45.650 --> 08:48.402
-Well, what can we do you for?
-Hmm?

08:48.486 --> 08:50.238
-We just have a few questions.
-Why?

08:50.321 --> 08:51.906
The hit-and-run. We need your statements.

08:51.989 --> 08:52.823
Oh!

08:52.907 --> 08:54.158
-My God. Duh.
-Right.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.284
-Hello?
-Yeah.

08:55.368 --> 08:56.994
-Head injury.
-Thank you.

08:57.078 --> 08:59.455
-Come on in. Yeah.
-Yeah, yeah, come on in.

09:01.082 --> 09:03.125
-Get comfy. Yeah.
-Uh, thanks.

09:03.209 --> 09:06.587
Hey, uh, Judy, before we start,
I just wanna say…

09:06.671 --> 09:10.258
I'm really sorry about Steve.
I assume you've heard the news by now.

09:10.883 --> 09:12.885
-Thank you. It was a shock.
-Yeah. She was--

09:12.969 --> 09:15.763
-I mean, we were just, uh, so surprised.
-Oh. Yeah.

09:15.846 --> 09:19.183
I mean, I-I really--
I-I can't believe that he was…

09:19.267 --> 09:23.020
…he was found
in such a remote location.

09:23.104 --> 09:24.564
Do you know what happened?

09:25.147 --> 09:28.025
Um, no, we don't.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.735
No, it's not our jurisdiction.

09:29.819 --> 09:30.945
What-- what does that mean?

09:31.028 --> 09:34.115
Well, the body was found
in Angeles National Forest.

09:34.198 --> 09:36.867
-That's federal land.
-Which makes it a federal crime.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.870
Which means
the FBI has taken over the case.

09:39.954 --> 09:41.455
Oh.

09:41.539 --> 09:42.957
-Duh.
-That makes sense.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.585
-Federal. The first word in the BI.
-Yeah, FBI would--

09:45.668 --> 09:49.589
-Yeah, that's Feds.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.632
-My throat's a little dry.
-Oh, no.

09:52.341 --> 09:55.803
Yeah, yeah, I think I'm gonna--
I need some tea. Does anyone want any tea?

09:57.722 --> 09:59.849
I do. Yes. I like tea.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.226
Well, I have many kinds.
Would you like to go look?

10:02.935 --> 10:04.103
If you insist.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.187
-I do!
-Right.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.898
Right this way, sir.

10:08.441 --> 10:09.567
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

10:10.568 --> 10:12.612
Didn't take her
for a tea drinker.

10:12.695 --> 10:14.780
-Oh, God.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.033
-You got a crack there.
-What? Huh?

10:17.116 --> 10:20.620
-You should fix that before it gets worse.
-What? Oh, that.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.788
Oh, yeah. Well, you know what?

10:22.872 --> 10:26.584
It's kind of low on my "shit I have to
deal with" list at the moment.

10:26.667 --> 10:30.546
So, when were you gonna tell me
that the fucking FBI took over?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.841
You realize I don't work for you.
I don't have to tell you anything.

10:33.924 --> 10:36.719
Well, can you at least tell me
what it means now that they're in charge?

10:36.802 --> 10:38.596
I mean, what's gonna happen?

10:38.679 --> 10:40.097
God, I don't know!

10:40.181 --> 10:44.101
Uh, anything you can remember
about the person driving? Male? Female?

10:44.185 --> 10:46.687
I mean, gender isn't always binary,
so I can't say, but…

10:46.771 --> 10:49.732
I mean, I don't know.
I was too focused on Jen.

10:49.815 --> 10:52.234
-Okay. Uh, did you see a plate number?
-Mm.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.737
-Color? Size?
-Mm. Hmm?

10:54.820 --> 10:57.490
I mean, I think maybe it was an SUV?

10:57.573 --> 10:59.492
-Okay, that's good. Good. That's great.
-Okay.

11:02.078 --> 11:04.121
Look, um, I don't wanna alarm you,

11:04.205 --> 11:09.085
but in light of what happened to Steve,
I just-- I gotta ask.

11:09.168 --> 11:11.295
Have you noticed anything weird lately?

11:12.254 --> 11:14.215
-How weird?
-Anyone following you?

11:14.298 --> 11:15.675
-Uh…
-Strange cars outside?

11:15.758 --> 11:17.218
No, I don't think so. Why?

11:17.301 --> 11:19.428
-Off the record?
-Yeah, totally off.

11:20.137 --> 11:23.307
I just have this odd feeling
it might all be connected somehow.

11:24.141 --> 11:26.560
Steve's death. Your hit-and-run.

11:26.644 --> 11:28.104
Connected?

11:29.188 --> 11:30.272
How?

11:30.356 --> 11:34.193
So I just get a life sentence,
even though it's self-defense.

11:34.276 --> 11:36.529
His bludgeoned body
was found decomposing in the woods.

11:36.612 --> 11:38.239
Doesn't exactly reek of self-defense.

11:38.322 --> 11:40.783
There's just gotta be something
that you can do to help me.

11:40.866 --> 11:44.453
Help you? I-I could lose everything!
My job. I could go to prison.

11:44.537 --> 11:45.871
Oh, good. Then we'd be roommates.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.290
No, I'm sorry. You're on your own.
It's out of my hands.

11:48.374 --> 11:50.167
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

11:50.251 --> 11:52.878
I tried to do the right thing,
and you told me to go home.

11:52.962 --> 11:54.922
So this is still very much in your hands.

11:55.005 --> 11:56.882
By my calculations,
the right thing would've been

11:56.966 --> 11:59.260
to not kill a man
and bury him in the woods.

11:59.343 --> 12:00.761
I was protecting Judy.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.221
-Steve would've killed her.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.806
So I did the right thing,

12:03.889 --> 12:05.766
it just looked wrong.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.227
So, you know, by my calculations,

12:08.310 --> 12:11.397
you were the last one to do a wrong thing.

12:11.480 --> 12:13.941
So now you need
to do the right thing by me.

12:14.024 --> 12:14.900
You threatening me?

12:16.068 --> 12:17.069
Is it working?

12:21.240 --> 12:24.660
Fine. Okay, I'll see what I can do,
but no more surprises.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.495
No more carving hearts in trees.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.167
Unless that wasn't you,
and you're still protecting Judy.

12:31.250 --> 12:33.878
Judy is innocent. Please. I swear.

12:33.961 --> 12:35.880
She has no idea about any of it.

12:35.963 --> 12:38.758
The truth's
gonna come out. It always does.

12:38.841 --> 12:40.926
So if I were you,
I'd get my ducks in a row.

12:44.513 --> 12:46.932
-Answer the phone.

12:47.016 --> 12:50.352
Sorry, no outside communication.
I'm your family now.

12:51.312 --> 12:52.313
Okay.

12:52.396 --> 12:55.524
Hey, Boop! It's, uh, your mama!

12:55.608 --> 12:57.610
Um…

12:57.693 --> 13:00.154
I, uh… I was just wondering
when you were gonna come home,

13:00.237 --> 13:02.448
and I-I have a question for you.

13:02.531 --> 13:03.574
-So bye.

13:03.657 --> 13:06.327
Nick thinks whoever killed Steve
might have hit us.

13:06.410 --> 13:07.328
-He does?
-He does.

13:07.411 --> 13:09.038
He thinks it could be the Greeks.

13:09.121 --> 13:11.081
We should be
on the lookout for anything suspicious

13:11.165 --> 13:13.918
because if the Greeks killed Steve,
I could be next.

13:14.001 --> 13:15.503
I mean, that's actually kind of scary.

13:15.586 --> 13:16.712
-Judy.
-What?

13:16.796 --> 13:18.589
-We're the fucking Greeks!
-But are we?

13:21.759 --> 13:23.177
-Hey, I--
-Hey!

13:23.260 --> 13:24.637
Hey!

13:24.720 --> 13:26.806
Your birthday cupcakes are almost ready.

13:26.889 --> 13:28.390
I don't want your fucking cupcakes.

13:29.350 --> 13:30.559
Char!

13:31.310 --> 13:32.436
I'm sorry he's such a dick.

13:32.520 --> 13:33.979
-Get me some water, hon?
-Oh, yeah.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.116
Ta-da!

13:46.617 --> 13:47.576
Hey.

13:49.495 --> 13:51.288
Did you finally get your neck done?

13:51.372 --> 13:53.749
What? No. Lorna, I was--

13:53.833 --> 13:55.167
I was in a car accident.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.878
-Mm. Good cover.
-Is that a new car?

13:58.504 --> 14:01.632
-Isn't it fabulous?
-Oh, my God!

14:01.715 --> 14:04.051
This is literally, like, my dream car.

14:04.134 --> 14:05.219
Yeah.

14:05.302 --> 14:07.763
Well, it's yours! Happy birthday!

14:07.847 --> 14:10.140
-Are you kidding me?
-Are you kidding me?

14:10.224 --> 14:12.059
Have I ever made a joke in your direction?

14:12.142 --> 14:14.478
-Thank you, Grandma.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.438
I really needed this today.

14:17.189 --> 14:20.234
-Lorna. Lorna. Lorna!

14:20.317 --> 14:23.279
-You cannot give my son a car.
-Why not? You can't afford it.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.240
That's better than a Kia, huh?

14:26.323 --> 14:28.117
-It is.
-Shit.

14:28.200 --> 14:32.454
It's just a shame Teddy isn't alive
to see his first son in his first car.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.748
-Yeah.
-It is a shame.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.125
-Hmm.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.002
You never get over losing a child.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.129
Or a husband, or a father.

14:42.214 --> 14:43.340
You wouldn't understand.

14:44.216 --> 14:45.175
Oh.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.678
-Sorry, I-I need to--
-Judy, I--

14:48.387 --> 14:50.472
-What's her problem?

14:54.435 --> 14:57.688
-Are you okay, honey?
-No, I burnt the fucking cupcakes!

14:58.397 --> 15:01.317
-I'm just tired. I'm just so tired.
-You are?

15:01.400 --> 15:03.986
Do you need to go lay down? Honey?

15:06.822 --> 15:09.325
What if I just told Charlie what happened?

15:09.408 --> 15:11.327
He already hates me anyway.

15:11.911 --> 15:14.872
Doesn't he deserve to have some closure?

15:14.955 --> 15:16.665
Look, I get that you wanna tell him.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.085
Trust me, I-I understand.
I just think that he…

15:21.545 --> 15:23.964
He needs to be
in the right place to hear it.

15:24.048 --> 15:26.467
Okay, well, it's eating me up inside.

15:26.550 --> 15:29.720
I just wish I had been honest about it
from the beginning.

15:29.803 --> 15:32.556
Then you'd have just told me
to go fuck myself off the bat.

15:32.640 --> 15:33.849
None of this would've happened.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.435
I'm the shoe, Jen. I'm the fucking shoe.

15:36.518 --> 15:39.855
Everything I touch
turns into a rotten pile of shit.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.815
-Okay, that is not true.
-It <i>is </i>true!

15:41.899 --> 15:44.234
And I gave Henry
the stupid fucking missing bird.

15:44.318 --> 15:47.279
And now I can't even
make fucking cupcakes!

15:47.363 --> 15:48.489
Okay, first of all…

15:50.324 --> 15:52.701
-I would have eaten those.
-Oh, shit.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.412
Second.
The bird is not missing, okay?

15:55.496 --> 15:56.747
Henry has it.

15:58.165 --> 16:00.542
God, I just realized where…
I think I might know where it is.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.962
That it's on his bedside table.
I'm gonna go get it.

16:03.045 --> 16:04.463
Okay.

16:05.047 --> 16:08.217
Just everything's gonna be--
it's gonna be fine, okay?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.176
All right, it's--

16:09.259 --> 16:11.095
No, it's not.

16:13.472 --> 16:15.140
What? Oh, what? What? Oh, my God!

16:15.224 --> 16:17.351
-What happened?
-No, no, no, no. It's fine.

16:17.434 --> 16:18.560
-Wait.
-Don't touch me!

16:18.644 --> 16:21.522
-Sorry, sorry.
-Don't, don't, don't.

16:21.605 --> 16:23.482
-Don't touch.
-Okay. Sorry.

16:24.316 --> 16:26.568
-Yep, no, just, no. Ah! Ah! Stop it!
-I'm not touching you.

16:26.652 --> 16:29.029
-Shit!

16:29.113 --> 16:31.824
-Why are you answering the door?
-It's muscle memory. I'm overwhelmed.

16:32.825 --> 16:35.202
-Hi! Ben!
-Hey, Judes.

16:35.285 --> 16:38.247
Uh, got a little
wicker wellness basket for Jen.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.207
-Got some Epsom salts, glucosamine.
-What?

16:40.290 --> 16:41.750
-Uh, CBD oil rub.
-Mm-hmm.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.128
-And of course, dark chocolate.
-Can you stop talking?

16:44.211 --> 16:46.171
-Come here.
-What monster doesn't like a candle?

16:49.842 --> 16:52.511
-Hey.
-Hey, Ben. That's really nice of you.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.304
Oh, my God, what-- what happened?

16:54.388 --> 16:57.725
She was trying to go upstairs, but her
ribs are bruised, and her back is bad.

16:57.808 --> 16:59.351
-A perfect storm of shit.

16:59.435 --> 17:00.769
-Oh, my God!
-I got you.

17:00.853 --> 17:01.937
-I got you.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.188
Oh, thank you.

17:03.272 --> 17:04.857
Oh, fuck!

17:04.940 --> 17:09.111
-Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!
-Shit, that is so sweet.

17:09.194 --> 17:12.614
-Okay, easy.
-Thank you.

17:12.698 --> 17:15.659
-How's that?
-That's much better, thank you.

17:15.743 --> 17:18.662
Hope you, uh, didn't break a rib
picking me up. 

17:18.746 --> 17:20.748
Please. You're like a feather.

17:20.831 --> 17:23.208
And you're like a liar.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.461
-Here, let me just…
-Oh, thanks.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.589
-God, sorry.
-Okay, nope, nope, nope.

17:28.672 --> 17:30.132
-Got it.
-It's for comfort.

17:30.215 --> 17:31.633
It's okay. It's okay.

17:31.717 --> 17:35.179
I'm so sorry about the… accident.

17:35.262 --> 17:38.182
No, gosh, no.
I'm-- I'm really sorry about Steve.

17:39.016 --> 17:40.267
How are you doing?

17:40.768 --> 17:44.021
Uh… You know, I'm… still in shock.

17:44.605 --> 17:47.107
Just hearing his body
was found in the woods.

17:47.191 --> 17:48.984
It's like…

17:49.068 --> 17:51.904
I know he was involved with bad people.
I didn't know how bad.

17:51.987 --> 17:55.407
-I mean, apparently so bad, right?
-I mean, that's-- Yeah.

17:55.491 --> 17:58.118
Steve and I, we…
you know, we had our issues,

17:58.202 --> 18:00.370
but we came into the world together,

18:00.454 --> 18:02.831
and, you know, we were a unit.

18:02.915 --> 18:05.084
And now it's like…

18:05.167 --> 18:06.335
I know it sounds weird to say,

18:06.418 --> 18:09.880
but it's like
I don't know who I am without him.

18:09.963 --> 18:13.509
-That doesn't sound weird at all.
-No.

18:14.468 --> 18:15.969
I just wish we hadn't fought

18:17.221 --> 18:19.306
the last time we saw each other. I wish…

18:21.266 --> 18:23.185
I wish I could have made things right.

18:23.268 --> 18:24.353
Oh, that's so hard

18:25.354 --> 18:28.107
that you can't do that,
no matter how badly you want to.

18:28.190 --> 18:30.025
And I can't, you know…

18:32.069 --> 18:34.780
I can't tell him how sorry I am,
and that sucks.

18:34.863 --> 18:37.699
-You can though. You can talk to him.

18:37.783 --> 18:39.201
-I do.
-What are you talking--

18:39.284 --> 18:43.705
I mean, I will?
I-I plan on it, and you should try it too.

18:43.789 --> 18:45.833
-You could-- Yeah!
-Talk to him?

18:45.916 --> 18:48.877
Yeah, maybe you can work through some…

18:48.961 --> 18:50.671
Or if you have any regrets.

18:50.754 --> 18:54.216
I got a boatload of those.

18:54.299 --> 18:56.760
-Yeah.
-Mom?

18:56.844 --> 18:59.138
-Oh, hey, Boop.
-You okay?

18:59.221 --> 19:00.514
Yeah. No.

19:00.597 --> 19:02.808
I'm fine. We just, Judy and I, um,

19:02.891 --> 19:06.270
we got into just a car accident and--
but we're fine.

19:06.353 --> 19:07.771
What-- what happened? Who hit you?

19:08.355 --> 19:11.233
Um, we don't know that yet.

19:11.316 --> 19:14.903
So it was another hit-and-run? Like Dad?

19:15.779 --> 19:18.866
Yes, honey, but-- but we're fine, okay?

19:18.949 --> 19:22.661
We-- we talked to the police,
and they are gonna find who did this.

19:22.744 --> 19:23.829
I promise.

19:24.329 --> 19:26.707
-Okay? Aww.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.626
Oh, okay.

19:29.710 --> 19:31.461
Excuse me for just a minute.

19:32.379 --> 19:34.256
I'm gonna get you some pain pills.

20:17.466 --> 20:18.467
Steve?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.387
-Hey, brother.

20:22.471 --> 20:24.681
You're a real piece of shit.
You know that?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.025
Okay.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.023
You're good. You're good.
You're good. You're good.

21:15.607 --> 21:18.318
You're good.

21:19.361 --> 21:20.862
Oh.

21:20.946 --> 21:21.905
Hi.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.034
How's it going?
Hey, Henry, how are you?

21:26.118 --> 21:29.955
I just wanted to say
I'm sorry about your brother.

21:30.747 --> 21:31.790
My mom told me.

21:33.542 --> 21:37.004
Thank you, buddy.
I really appreciate that.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.550
Losing someone sucks.

21:42.968 --> 21:44.094
It really does, doesn't it?

21:44.177 --> 21:47.431
Yeah, but it gets easier. I--

21:47.931 --> 21:51.435
I mean, the missing part doesn't go away.

21:52.978 --> 21:54.604
But it stops hurting as much.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.607
Yeah.

21:59.359 --> 22:00.652
Can I give you something?

22:01.820 --> 22:04.031
-Sure. Yeah, what do you-- what do you--

22:12.998 --> 22:13.999
Thanks.

22:23.216 --> 22:25.344
Hey, there you are.

22:25.427 --> 22:27.804
Look at-- look what I'm watching.

22:27.888 --> 22:30.390
Oh, yeah. Hey, what-- what are these?

22:31.558 --> 22:32.476
Oh, shit.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.602
Yeah.

22:33.685 --> 22:35.645
-Are you okay?

22:35.729 --> 22:36.730
What is going on?

22:36.813 --> 22:39.441
Okay, um, just sit-- sit down, okay?

22:40.609 --> 22:44.363
I've been trying to tell you all day.

22:44.446 --> 22:47.949
But there
were just so many shoes,

22:48.033 --> 22:50.077
and, um, I didn't know how to tell you.

22:51.495 --> 22:53.872
Well, you can tell me anything.

23:00.337 --> 23:03.507
They found shadows on the CT.

23:03.590 --> 23:05.509
-Oh, my God.
-And…

23:05.592 --> 23:06.718
-Jen.
-Hmm?

23:06.802 --> 23:08.970
You told me you only had
a few bruised ribs.

23:09.596 --> 23:10.639
Oh.

23:11.473 --> 23:12.516
I-I do.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.017
Okay.

23:15.268 --> 23:18.230
Well, then I don't understand.
Why do you have these?

23:21.608 --> 23:23.443
Because they thought I was you.

23:24.861 --> 23:25.779
What?

23:25.862 --> 23:29.116
When the doctor came in,
I was-- I was in your bed

23:29.199 --> 23:32.744
'cause mine was wet and not because--
It's a-- it's a story.

23:32.828 --> 23:35.247
-Oh.
-But, um, they…

23:35.330 --> 23:37.457
they gave me your results.

23:39.626 --> 23:40.961
Oh.

23:44.214 --> 23:45.507
So you're okay?

23:46.967 --> 23:48.385
Yeah.

23:50.387 --> 23:52.764
So I'm the one that has the…

23:54.099 --> 23:57.394
Look, I don't--
just-- we don't know anything, okay?

23:57.477 --> 24:00.272
They were just shadows.
It's probably nothing.

24:00.355 --> 24:02.482
I-I swear. You're gonna be fine.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.235
Whatever it takes, okay?

24:10.031 --> 24:11.908
I'm so happy you're okay.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.959
Hey, Charlie. Listen, can we talk?

25:03.043 --> 25:04.127
How'd you guys meet?

25:04.211 --> 25:05.212
Who?

25:05.295 --> 25:06.421
You and my dad.

25:07.964 --> 25:08.924
Oh.

25:09.674 --> 25:11.092
Uh… um…

25:12.344 --> 25:13.303
He was running,

25:13.386 --> 25:14.888
and, uh, I don't know.

25:14.971 --> 25:17.682
It all happened so fast.
It was kind of like a blur.

25:18.850 --> 25:20.185
How long did it go on for?

25:23.188 --> 25:25.482
I really wanna tell you the truth.

25:28.401 --> 25:29.402
Please.

25:30.820 --> 25:31.988
I can handle it.

25:32.989 --> 25:33.990
I can.

25:40.664 --> 25:41.957
It was just one night.

25:45.085 --> 25:47.128
And if I would have known
that he had a family,

25:47.212 --> 25:49.506
I would have done everything differently.

26:11.278 --> 26:12.487
Happy birthday.

26:13.405 --> 26:15.865
Right. You nice and cozy?

26:15.949 --> 26:16.783
Yeah.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.621
Is there anything
that you wanna talk about? Or…

26:22.706 --> 26:23.748
Hmm. No, not really.

26:23.832 --> 26:26.334
Okay. Well, try to get to sleep soon.

26:26.418 --> 26:27.377
Yeah.

26:28.336 --> 26:29.629
Oh, you know what?

26:29.713 --> 26:30.589
Before I forget.

26:30.672 --> 26:33.008
Did Charlie give
you back your little bird?

26:33.091 --> 26:34.426
'Cause I wanted to fix it for you.

26:34.509 --> 26:36.469
Oh, yeah, but I don't have it anymore.

26:36.553 --> 26:37.679
What? Why?

26:38.263 --> 26:39.139
I gave it away.

26:40.140 --> 26:41.224
To who?

27:08.960 --> 27:10.587
You're a real piece of shit.
You know that?

27:10.670 --> 27:12.797
-Shut up.
-Drunk again. Surprise, surprise.

27:12.881 --> 27:14.716
-Fucking bully.
-You fucking loser!

27:16.426 --> 27:18.470
Leave me alone.

27:51.002 --> 27:53.171
Hey, man. I think you forgot something.
