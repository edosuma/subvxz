to stay here for a little bit.

00:08.770 --> 00:09.907
(YELLS)

00:09.970 --> 00:11.631
I sort of floated
him some cash.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.302
Y'all keep it cool
on our corners.
We keep shit peaceful.

00:13.380 --> 00:15.109
Nigga, you trippin'.

00:15.180 --> 00:16.738
We're here to talk
about Isabelle.

00:16.810 --> 00:18.209
She tried to shot Alex.

00:18.280 --> 00:20.714
I am not a babysitter.
It's not part of the deal.

00:20.780 --> 00:22.941
Does Wes live here?
I'm his daughter.

00:23.020 --> 00:24.282
Stay away.
Live you God damn life.

00:24.350 --> 00:26.511
"Live my God damn life?"

00:26.590 --> 00:28.649
They already own GenCoin.
If they own the Dark
web too...

00:28.720 --> 00:29.982
I know.

00:30.060 --> 00:31.982
We would really like to talk
about Guizer but...

00:32.060 --> 00:33.322
Who did you sell to?

00:33.400 --> 00:36.119
To Axis,
your friend Alex Bell.

00:36.200 --> 00:37.462
Araknet?
Yeah.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.191
I think it's going
to be a pass for me.

00:39.270 --> 00:40.532
I think Araknet could
be really something.

00:40.600 --> 00:41.931
Cool. I, uh,
appreciate that.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.206
Call me, sometime.

00:43.270 --> 00:45.033
Get him, Tou.
You ain't shit, dawg.

00:45.110 --> 00:46.304

whatever you need,
we got you.

give him some
more space.

all this food.

01:12.470 --> 01:14.233

Just leave it here.

01:14.940 --> 01:16.828
Hey, so, uh...

01:16.910 --> 01:19.731
I made you some Ropa Vieja.

01:19.810 --> 01:23.576
Probably tastes like shit,
but I'll leave it right here.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.641
Okay, just...
On your rug.

01:25.710 --> 01:27.871
Leave it here so
he doesn't step on it.

gonna do it, then who?

03:44.720 --> 03:46.483

I'd be using it to pay Off

and his associates,

managed such a feat

seeing here is a shift

that the horse every body
wants to back right now,

04:57.560 --> 05:00.449
is currency that no one fully
understands yet

thinking about it this way.

Think about IBM versus Apple
or Myspace versus Facebook.

05:24.320 --> 05:27.448

concerned about being first,

05:27.520 --> 05:30.318

about who's better.

05:44.410 --> 05:46.264
The cipher. From Guizer.

05:46.340 --> 05:50.379

is a terrible idea.

need your help.

eating this,

my dad would tell her that
I need some new clothes,

10:26.720 --> 10:28.688
and we'd come here.

10:28.760 --> 10:31.684

wonder why you didn't
come back with new clothes?

you could say that would...

think badly Of him.

to cash out pretty legit

and stole it from him.

of times so I guarantee you
she can still taste blood.
