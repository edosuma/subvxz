It all started
with my trip to Germany,

in a new way to treat dementia.

to revisit the past.

in housing units

whatever time period

01:25.753 --> 01:28.389

are most comfortable in.

01:28.422 --> 01:32.493

are living better lives.

01:32.526 --> 01:34.262
And in some cases,
they are even regaining

01:34.295 --> 01:36.797

of who they once were.

01:36.830 --> 01:38.866

my goal was to create

similar programs in the future.
