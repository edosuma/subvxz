00:31.698 --> 00:34.258
Come on! Yeah.

00:34.434 --> 00:35.458
Hey.

00:35.635 --> 00:37.967
Hey, tres to dos on Big Red!

00:38.138 --> 00:40.163
Tres to dos on Big Red.

00:40.340 --> 00:44.606
- Big Red! Big Red! Big Red!
- You ready, motherfucker?

00:44.778 --> 00:47.713
Yeah! Yeah!

00:49.883 --> 00:50.941
Yeah.

00:54.754 --> 00:57.951
Kick his fucking ass! Yeah, kill him!

00:58.124 --> 00:59.489
Yeah!

00:59.659 --> 01:01.684
Yeah!

01:04.297 --> 01:06.561
Pay up, motherfucker!

01:19.712 --> 01:21.475
You know who I am.

01:22.916 --> 01:24.383
And you know my reputation.

01:26.386 --> 01:31.346
And yet you place a bet with me, and you
don't have the fucking money to pay.

01:31.524 --> 01:35.551
- I pay you later, carnal.
- Steve does not accept fucking layaway.

01:35.728 --> 01:37.559
If you make a fucking bet with Steve...

01:37.730 --> 01:40.893
...you fucking pay Steve
when his fucking cock wins.

01:41.067 --> 01:43.433
Do we comprehende?

01:44.270 --> 01:47.364
Obviously not.
Obviously you don't comprehend.

01:47.640 --> 01:49.232
Fuck him up.

01:51.544 --> 01:54.240
Rough his fucking ass up.
Check his pockets, Aaron.

01:54.414 --> 01:57.850
Search every fucking
nook and cranny of that cheapskate.

01:58.885 --> 02:01.718
I'm gonna cut your fucking dick...

02:01.888 --> 02:05.346
...and maybe that'll put a fucking smile
on your fucking face.

02:05.525 --> 02:08.050
Maybe. Maybe we will cut
this motherfucker's balls off.

02:08.228 --> 02:11.129
You know what?
I can cut off your titties.

02:11.297 --> 02:14.562
- Don't make him cut me, Steve.
- Titty, titty, bang, bang.

02:15.068 --> 02:18.765
He will titty-titty-bang-bang you.
He will fucking cut your tits off right here.

02:18.938 --> 02:20.906
Take him, my donkey. He's all I have.

02:21.207 --> 02:23.835
- Fuck your donkey, bitch.
- Yeah, fuck that donkey.

02:24.010 --> 02:25.443
Why would I want that thing?

02:25.645 --> 02:28.546
He can carry things,
and you can make money with him.

02:28.948 --> 02:32.315
Paint him like a zebra and charge gringos.

02:32.485 --> 02:35.010
- Charge a who?
- The tourists.

02:35.188 --> 02:36.212
Take photos.

02:36.389 --> 02:40.621
I can't believe you would look at me
and the word "gringo" would come to mind.

02:40.793 --> 02:43.591
I think we got a fucking Mexican racist!

02:43.763 --> 02:47.631
Does it make your life easier just
to throw a quick racist term at somebody?

02:47.800 --> 02:49.734
A man who has seen the things
I've seen...

02:49.903 --> 02:53.395
...experienced the loss and pain
that I've experienced...

02:53.573 --> 02:54.870
...I transcend race, hombre.

02:55.041 --> 02:59.410
You understand, you motherfucker,
you fucking cocksucker?

02:59.579 --> 03:03.015
- Of course, and you are no gringo.
- Thank you for acknowledging that.

03:03.183 --> 03:04.514
A word of advice:

03:04.684 --> 03:08.176
Next time you wanna bet on my cock,
you better bring some fucking pesos.

03:08.354 --> 03:11.653
- Got it, ése?
- I got you, Steve.

03:12.392 --> 03:14.883
Gather the jackass and the cock.
We're out of here.

03:15.061 --> 03:16.289
- Hit it.
- Let's go.

03:16.462 --> 03:18.293
I'll grab the fucking donkey.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.630
This is me now.

03:28.508 --> 03:30.567
See you soon.

03:41.621 --> 03:44.488
A man haunted by the sacrifices
he's had to make.

03:48.861 --> 03:49.885
Shit.

03:51.064 --> 03:52.861
Fucking moron!

03:53.766 --> 03:56.132
A man who ran and never looked back.

04:00.773 --> 04:05.107
A man who drank his ass all the way
down to the butthole of America.

04:05.278 --> 04:07.041
Fucking Mexico.

04:07.213 --> 04:09.443
I left my country to begin a new life...

04:09.616 --> 04:12.813
...one where I could finally blend
with those I was living amongst...

04:12.986 --> 04:15.011
...become just another face in the crowd.

04:18.291 --> 04:21.317
Soon I was embraced by the natives.

04:21.494 --> 04:24.327
The wild landscape became my mistress.

04:29.335 --> 04:32.702
The wild women, my cum caves.

04:35.008 --> 04:38.375
Soon enough,
I felt like an entirely new person.

04:44.150 --> 04:48.018
But truthfully,
sometimes I did wonder about them.

04:48.354 --> 04:50.720
About how they'd deal with the holes,
the agonies...

04:50.890 --> 04:53.188
...the darknesses that no doubt
fell upon them...

04:53.359 --> 04:57.056
...when I rode off into the sunset
and then took that sunset with me.

04:58.331 --> 05:00.959
Do they even remember
what it's like to have hope?

05:02.435 --> 05:05.734
Did they forget how
to close their eyes and dream?

05:05.905 --> 05:09.807
Did they discover that, without me,
they may as well not even exist?

05:09.976 --> 05:13.707
Can anyone get a fucking break
around here?

05:13.946 --> 05:15.811
And although it makes me kind of sad...

05:15.982 --> 05:18.576
...I know that this savage land
was made for me.

05:18.751 --> 05:20.719
It's where outlaws go to die.

05:20.887 --> 05:23.481
And as that day nears,
I take comfort in knowing...

05:23.656 --> 05:27.786
...that the lives of those I left behind
are better off without -

05:28.728 --> 05:30.423
Goddamn it.

05:37.637 --> 05:39.195
Goddamn it.

05:39.372 --> 05:41.806
How many times
do I gotta tell y'all to keep it down?

05:41.974 --> 05:42.998
Keep your música down.

05:43.176 --> 05:46.236
Y'all out here kicking this soccer ball
around like you're Pelé...

05:46.412 --> 05:48.243
...blasting music. I'm trying to write.

05:48.648 --> 05:50.616
What kind of book are you writing?

05:50.783 --> 05:54.310
It's a motivational novel for people
dealing with grief and/or depression.

05:54.487 --> 05:57.979
It's honestly none of your business.
Will you get your brother off my moped?

05:58.157 --> 06:00.717
- How's it going, Steve?
- Let me make this clear, Catuey.

06:00.893 --> 06:04.351
If there is one thing I cannot stand,
it is fucking soccer. All right?

06:04.530 --> 06:06.361
I hate when people do it around me.

06:06.532 --> 06:10.059
Please hop off of my moped, please.
That's a very expensive vehicle.

06:12.872 --> 06:16.433
The language barrier, honestly,
is just so fucking frustrating right now.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.603
Oh, my God. I knew the barrio
was gonna be annoying...

06:21.781 --> 06:25.308
...but I didn't know it was gonna be
so loud. That's why I'm so frustrated.

06:25.485 --> 06:29.285
Listen, you still have not taken us up
on our offer for dinner, my friend.

06:29.455 --> 06:32.151
My wife is a wonderful cook.
We would love to host you.

06:32.525 --> 06:34.993
Yeah, looks like she's cooking
seared titty right now.

06:35.161 --> 06:38.187
Man, I feel like this is some
goddamn National Geographic shit.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.889
Who the fuck is that?
How many people you got in there?

06:41.067 --> 06:44.195
That's Maria, my sister in law.
You know what they say about family?

06:44.370 --> 06:48.238
- Family that prays together, stays together.
- Yeah, well, I appreciate the offer...

06:48.408 --> 06:50.672
...but I'm not into bonding
with people down here.

06:50.843 --> 06:53.937
I got a family. I don't need
the fucked-up version of the original.

06:54.113 --> 06:56.206
Your wife's titty
does look beautiful, though.

06:59.018 --> 07:03.819
And in addition to all that other stuff,
Kenny Powers still does not like children.

07:03.990 --> 07:07.357
Chapter Three:
Shit to do in Mexico in the nighttime.

07:35.788 --> 07:37.346
To all my friends present here

07:37.523 --> 07:39.218
at the stadium in this moment...

07:39.892 --> 07:41.757
Let me tell you that
we're here in the 8th inning,

07:41.928 --> 07:44.522
and the Charros are losing 7 to 0.

07:45.832 --> 07:48.630
I feel like hitting them with my shoe
to see if they'll come up with anything!

07:57.710 --> 08:00.076
Disgraceful. Fucking disgraceful.

08:00.246 --> 08:03.215
Yeah, Charros suck big dicks!

08:05.284 --> 08:08.481
This is disgusting. Isn't it disgusting?

08:08.654 --> 08:11.452
- It's fucking gross.
- Yeah, it's absolutely gross.

08:11.624 --> 08:15.116
Hey, what's your fucking problem, man?

08:15.294 --> 08:18.127
Why are you giving me
this freaking... look?

08:18.831 --> 08:21.561
- He wants to start a fight, dude.
- Shut the fuck up.

08:21.734 --> 08:25.101
Now, what's the-? What's your problem?
Yeah, you want more?

08:25.738 --> 08:26.830
You want to drink beer?

08:29.408 --> 08:31.467
I told you, didn't I?

08:31.644 --> 08:33.839
We're gonna get kicked out
of this motherfucker.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.510
Coach, he's back.

08:40.586 --> 08:42.053
What the hell is he doing here?

08:42.989 --> 08:44.013
Okay.

08:44.624 --> 08:46.854
Okay, let's go. The next one.
Don't worry about it.

08:48.060 --> 08:51.257
There's a lot of trim walking around.
I don't mind this joint at all.

08:51.430 --> 08:54.593
Neither do I. You know,
and let's talk fucking business first.

08:54.767 --> 08:59.101
Look at this motherfucker, always on point,
always wanting to get down to task.

08:59.272 --> 09:02.764
This little son of a bitch here
is probably the best sidekick I've ever had.

09:02.942 --> 09:07.675
He's beating you, Hector.
He is whooping your ass as a sidekick.

09:07.847 --> 09:09.781
- No, not fucking thumbs up.
- He has -

09:09.949 --> 09:14.443
- No, boss, he speaks no freaking English.
- Don't you ever wanna fucking win?

09:15.121 --> 09:17.316
- Oh, fuck.
- Do you wanna win?

09:17.490 --> 09:19.617
- Do you wanna win?
- Oh, yeah.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.726
Do you ever wanna jerk off?

09:24.163 --> 09:27.360
And Hector will have whatever
Aaron's having, only not as good.

09:27.533 --> 09:30.229
He hasn't reached that stage yet.

10:28.694 --> 10:30.184
Hey.

10:31.197 --> 10:34.633
- Hey. Where you been?
- Oh, I've been around.

10:34.800 --> 10:37.633
- You're not mad, are you?
- Why would I be mad at you?

10:37.803 --> 10:41.034
You know, because I got busy
and I didn't immediately call you back...

10:41.207 --> 10:42.674
...after I had made sex to you.

10:43.109 --> 10:46.704
Oh, no, I didn't expect
anything from you, so...

10:46.879 --> 10:48.608
I was pretty upfront with everything.

10:48.781 --> 10:52.273
I told you I was damaged goods and
I wasn't trying to get close to anybody.

10:52.451 --> 10:55.215
Yeah, you were pretty clear about that.

10:55.388 --> 10:58.016
Yeah, I mean it's really
for your own protection.

10:58.190 --> 11:01.819
People who get close to me,
well, they tend to get hurt.

11:02.428 --> 11:06.125
So I don't know what you're getting into
after all this, if you wanna...

11:07.533 --> 11:09.296
- I'm busy tonight.
- Oh, yeah, me too.

11:09.468 --> 11:12.904
I'm working on a book. I'm a writer.

11:13.072 --> 11:15.267
You got anything going on
maybe tomorrow night?

11:15.441 --> 11:19.343
- I'm pretty busy tomorrow too.
- Busy tomorrow too?

11:20.079 --> 11:22.775
Think I'm starting
to kind of get the picture here.

11:22.948 --> 11:25.143
You hit it and quit it.
That's how you roll?

11:25.317 --> 11:30.345
Oh, no, no. I just thought you were
just like a one-night-stand gringo.

11:30.523 --> 11:33.287
- That's it.
- You just saw me, like, as a piece of meat?

11:33.893 --> 11:35.656
Well, a good one, but...

11:35.828 --> 11:38.422
- I'm gonna be straight with you for a second.
- Okay.

11:38.597 --> 11:40.656
I'm new to Mexico
and I'm trying to adjust...

11:40.833 --> 11:44.325
...and most things are cool,
but I'm also kind of feeling a little weird...

11:44.503 --> 11:47.131
...and fucking empty all the time
and just fucking alone.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.940
I mean,
right now I just would like the comfort...

11:50.109 --> 11:52.907
...of somebody who seems normal...

11:53.079 --> 11:57.778
...and even though you're Mexican,
you seem normal to me.

12:02.221 --> 12:05.850
The sax player from Lost Boys trying
to rub the language barrier in my face.

12:06.025 --> 12:07.788
Is this guy giving you any trouble?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.929
- Why, you looking for some?
- No, he's not giving me any trouble.

12:11.097 --> 12:14.328
He's just a tourist who's lost.

12:14.633 --> 12:15.657
Right?

12:17.336 --> 12:19.531
Sure. A tourist who might
whip somebody's ass...

12:19.705 --> 12:22.299
...if they keep trying to isolate me
from conversations.

12:23.609 --> 12:25.236
Peace.

12:29.048 --> 12:32.415
- See you.
- Yeah. Awesome show.

12:32.585 --> 12:33.950
Thank you.

12:34.954 --> 12:36.546
See you around.

13:45.958 --> 13:47.721
- Hey, come on!
- Come on, come on!

13:47.893 --> 13:49.292
- Photos!
- Photos!

13:49.461 --> 13:51.895
- Step right up.
- Come to the real zebra.

13:52.064 --> 13:54.430
This is the one.
That motherfucker's got AIDS.

13:54.600 --> 13:57.797
You don't want an AIDS zebra picture.
You want a clean zebra picture.

13:57.970 --> 14:00.029
- Yeah.
- Look how tight their shit is, man.

14:00.206 --> 14:02.231
Their presentation
fucking blows ours away.

14:02.408 --> 14:04.672
You're standing here
with a sign on a Tecate box.

14:04.844 --> 14:07.108
We got Mice and Men here
with a disposable camera.

14:07.279 --> 14:10.771
We got the stupidest fucking jackass
in all of Mexico. Fuck those guys!

14:10.950 --> 14:12.076
That's a fake zebra.

14:12.251 --> 14:15.709
This is a real safari zebra
from the dark country of Africa.

14:15.888 --> 14:18.652
- Ten dollars, now.
- This is fucking unbelievable.

14:18.824 --> 14:21.486
- This is fucking shit.
- You know what? Fuck this.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.605
Safe!

14:36.709 --> 14:38.142
Damn it!

14:39.345 --> 14:41.939
Nice game, dick suckers.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.830
Hey, Kenny.

15:03.669 --> 15:05.500
Kenny Powers.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.137
Hey, you talking to me, muchacho?

15:09.308 --> 15:11.276
Well, yeah, hey, I was trying to.

15:11.443 --> 15:13.934
I'm Roger Hernandez,
manager of the Charros.

15:14.113 --> 15:16.980
- What are you doing down here?
- I think you got the wrong man.

15:17.149 --> 15:18.343
My name's Steve.

15:18.918 --> 15:22.183
Hey, I gotta tell you,
I admit the hair threw me for a minute.

15:22.354 --> 15:24.254
I was expecting to see
the famous mullet.

15:24.423 --> 15:27.085
Oh, yeah, Kenny Powers
does have famous hair, doesn't he?

15:27.259 --> 15:30.490
But this ain't his hair. This is Steve's hair.
Steve the cockfighter.

15:30.663 --> 15:31.960
Whoa, cockfighter.

15:32.131 --> 15:34.190
I'm a fucking cockfighter,
not a ball player.

15:34.366 --> 15:35.765
- I've never -
- Oh, really?

15:35.935 --> 15:37.129
- Been a ball player ever.

15:37.303 --> 15:40.431
So you're telling me
you're not Kenny Powers?

15:40.873 --> 15:42.340
No, hey, look, it's my fault.

15:42.508 --> 15:45.705
It's stupid of me to think Kenny Powers
would be living down here.

15:45.878 --> 15:47.709
With the kind of skills that guy had...

15:47.880 --> 15:52.180
...be a shame if he was spending his time
as a cockfighter and not on a field.

15:52.551 --> 15:55.418
- No offense, Steve.
- No offense taken.

15:55.587 --> 15:59.887
For Steve, this is a pretty awesome life.
He's improved things quite a bit.

16:00.459 --> 16:02.723
Sorry, just- It just seems so funny.

16:03.262 --> 16:05.059
I know Kenny Powers lost his pitch...

16:05.230 --> 16:08.131
...but can you imagine
if this was how low he'd really gotten?

16:08.300 --> 16:09.961
It's not fucking funny at all.

16:10.135 --> 16:12.763
From what I've heard,
Kenny Powers hasn't lost his pitch.

16:12.938 --> 16:15.429
Just got tired of baseball
always butt-fucking him.

16:15.607 --> 16:17.541
Causing him nothing
but pain and sorrow.

16:17.710 --> 16:20.702
Yeah, well, I'm sorry to hear
that Kenny Powers feels that way.

16:20.879 --> 16:23.313
It's a real shame
to let all that talent go to waste.

16:25.884 --> 16:28.614
Yeah, well,
too bad I'm not Kenny Powers.

16:36.795 --> 16:38.319
Too bad.

16:39.765 --> 16:41.824
Come on, work it, Big Red.

16:42.267 --> 16:43.666
Work it.

16:44.003 --> 16:46.403
There you go. Good job, buddy.

16:51.076 --> 16:53.670
Come on, buddy. Come on.

16:53.846 --> 16:55.370
Doing good, man.

16:55.547 --> 16:59.677
We're gonna fucking whup this
motherfucker's ass. Hear me? You hear me?

17:02.021 --> 17:03.511
It's time, boss.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.388
Let's do this.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.293
You have no chance, gringo.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.836
Vaya con Dios, motherfucker.

18:08.854 --> 18:10.378
Yeah!

18:10.889 --> 18:12.516
Yeah! Yeah!

18:31.777 --> 18:33.472
Fuck you!

18:34.580 --> 18:36.445
Fuck you, motherfucker!

19:08.580 --> 19:12.448
Big Red, you were a good cock.

19:13.185 --> 19:15.153
You made us a lot of money.

19:15.387 --> 19:19.118
May you find the peace in death
that you so longed for in life.

19:19.591 --> 19:22.219
I'm sorry about
the way things turned out.

19:23.328 --> 19:26.764
I'm sorry about the way
a lot of things have turned out.

19:27.499 --> 19:29.228
See you in hell, hombre.

19:29.401 --> 19:30.766
Y'all wanna add anything?

19:30.936 --> 19:34.497
Me and Hector, we don't
wanna work with you no more.

19:34.673 --> 19:36.334
What, are you guys kidding around?

19:37.276 --> 19:39.938
You're serious? I thought
we had a good thing going here.

19:40.112 --> 19:43.570
We're making money, hand over fist.
Is this you, Hector?

19:43.749 --> 19:47.412
Are you poisoning his mind just because
you and me didn't make a connection?

19:47.586 --> 19:50.350
No, man. It's me.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.114
I don't fucking like you.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.122
You don't like me?

19:54.593 --> 19:56.220
You're the one with the disability.

19:56.395 --> 19:58.659
It should be me not liking you,
yet I accept you.

19:58.830 --> 20:02.493
And you do this to me?
Man, fuck you, you midget.

20:02.668 --> 20:03.999
I'm taking the fucking cocks.

20:04.169 --> 20:07.696
Empty your pockets,
you fucking cock sucker.

20:07.873 --> 20:10.273
Oh, I see.
This is a fucking double-cross, huh?

20:10.442 --> 20:12.637
He'll bash my brains
and you'll cut my dick off?

20:12.811 --> 20:15.075
You're gonna steal the cocks
and fucking roll me?

20:15.247 --> 20:19.115
Fine. After I told you
that you were my best sidekick.

20:19.284 --> 20:22.549
Listen, bitch. I'm nobody's sidekick!

20:23.388 --> 20:26.846
Come, Hector. We're fucking done here.

20:30.662 --> 20:33.358
I can't believe y'all
would do this at Big Red's funeral...

20:33.532 --> 20:35.397
...when you know how much
he means to me.

20:35.901 --> 20:38.961
Fuck you, and fuck Big Red!

20:39.738 --> 20:44.471
- You're a cold motherfucker, Aaron.
- Go home, you fucking gringo.

20:44.643 --> 20:46.975
You don't fucking belong here.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.913
Hey, what's up?

21:25.117 --> 21:28.348
Wondering if y'all
had room for one mas more.

21:28.887 --> 21:30.411
Of course, my friend.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.523
Pasale, please. Come in.

21:38.930 --> 21:40.261
Shall we say grace?

21:59.318 --> 22:01.377
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:01.553 --> 22:05.489
And thank you, Lord, for letting
Steve join us for dinner. Amen.

22:05.657 --> 22:07.056
Amen.

22:13.332 --> 22:17.928
- That was a really nice prayer, Catuey.
- Thank you.

22:18.103 --> 22:20.731
But I think I should
confess something to you.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.334
Steve is not really who I am.

22:25.410 --> 22:26.968
Who are you?

22:29.147 --> 22:32.310
In Mexico a man can truly get lost.

22:32.484 --> 22:33.974
And if you're a bank robber...

22:34.152 --> 22:37.747
...or maybe somebody who's
committed a fucked-up crazy crime...

22:37.923 --> 22:39.481
...then that's a good thing.

22:39.825 --> 22:42.089
But hiding takes its toll.

22:42.394 --> 22:46.057
At first you don't realize it, but soon
the identity that you tried to shed...

22:46.231 --> 22:49.723
...starts getting pissed
and knocking at your insides.

22:50.369 --> 22:52.997
You know, when dealing
with deep depression and sad shit...

22:53.171 --> 22:55.332
...it's cool to pretend
like nothing is wrong.

22:55.507 --> 22:58.635
That sometimes works, but eventually...

22:58.810 --> 23:01.301
...you gotta call a goddamn
spade a spade and be like:

23:01.480 --> 23:04.779
"Yo, I'm fucked up
and I gotta make a change."

23:13.158 --> 23:15.126
Sometimes you gotta
wash away the paint...

23:15.293 --> 23:19.423
...and reveal to the world
the jackass that is hiding beneath.

23:37.849 --> 23:42.218
Sometimes you just gotta
get back in the fucking game.

23:52.063 --> 23:54.554
What the fuck is going on?

23:57.169 --> 24:00.366
Coach's staff, everyone,
come forward to me please.

24:01.907 --> 24:03.738
- Pull it in.
- Steve, what are you doing?

24:03.909 --> 24:05.240
You're interrupting practice.

24:05.410 --> 24:08.777
Practice doesn't seem to be working.
Come on, motherfuckers, get in here.

24:08.947 --> 24:10.278
I got a little announcement.

24:10.449 --> 24:13.077
I know a lot of you guys
have seen me around town, going:

24:13.251 --> 24:16.277
"Hey, there's Steve, the new guy,
running shit, the cockfighter."

24:16.455 --> 24:18.150
Well, I have a confession to make.

24:18.323 --> 24:20.951
My name's not Steve,
and I'm not a cockfighter.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.562
I'm a ball player,
and not just any ball player.

24:24.729 --> 24:26.287
I'm Kenny fucking Powers.

24:26.698 --> 24:31.032
And I reveal myself to you all here,
upon this field.

24:31.770 --> 24:33.431
Behold!

24:33.905 --> 24:35.896
It's my rookie card.
That's me on the front.

24:36.074 --> 24:39.703
Y'all wanna just pass this around
so you can just see it?

24:39.878 --> 24:42.938
I'm gonna need to get it back though.
I see the look on your faces.

24:43.114 --> 24:47.107
You're thinking, "Hey, Kenny, you're
from America. You probably have a printer.

24:47.285 --> 24:50.277
You could have just gone on the Internet
and printed that bitch."

24:50.455 --> 24:52.218
Yeah, you know what? I could have.

24:52.791 --> 24:59.219
Except for one fact: I don't own a printer,
and I fucking hate computers, all kinds.

25:00.065 --> 25:04.024
I come here today,
not just to bash on fucking technology...

25:04.202 --> 25:06.568
...but to offer you all a proposition.

25:06.771 --> 25:09.672
Let's face it, y'all fucking suck.

25:09.841 --> 25:12.401
Don't get your feelings hurt.
Don't get sensitive on me.

25:12.577 --> 25:13.908
I fucking suck too right now.

25:14.079 --> 25:18.140
I'm in the darkest Third World hole
I've ever been in in my entire life...

25:18.316 --> 25:21.877
...about a thousand hundred million miles
from where I should be...

25:22.053 --> 25:26.513
...and the only way for me
to get back there is for us to join forces.

25:26.691 --> 25:29.159
If we can make enough noise
down here...

25:29.327 --> 25:32.694
...then just maybe,
everyone in America will hear us.

25:32.864 --> 25:34.024
Everyone will.

25:34.199 --> 25:35.461
And they will all know...

25:35.634 --> 25:37.761
...that Kenny Powers is, in fact...

25:37.936 --> 25:40.700
...the Christ figure
that they perceive me to be.

25:41.406 --> 25:45.706
So if you all don't believe my words,
then perhaps you will believe this.

25:45.877 --> 25:48.437
Anyone have a ball?
Can I get an el ballo?

25:48.613 --> 25:51.776
Right there. Okay. Got it.

25:52.884 --> 25:57.048
Behold this, boys.
Try and fucking doubt this, all right?

26:18.977 --> 26:24.677
If this was America, you'd have a radar gun,
and right now it would read 101.

26:24.849 --> 26:26.942
- When's the next game, coach?
- Friday.

26:27.118 --> 26:28.642
See you dumb motherfuckers there.

26:28.820 --> 26:31.084
Where's the baseball card?
It's worth five bucks.

26:31.256 --> 26:33.315
Take that with me. Trying to pocket it.

26:33.491 --> 26:38.554
Keep my fucking eye on you.
All right, don't forget, my number's 55.

26:40.098 --> 26:43.124
Roger, what the hell is happening here?

26:45.337 --> 26:48.500
Fifty-five!
See you motherfuckers Friday.

26:48.974 --> 26:50.805
I think we just signed Kenny Powers.

26:50.976 --> 26:53.376
You got Kenny Powers
up in this motherfucker now!

26:53.545 --> 26:54.569
Son of a bitch.

26:54.746 --> 26:56.145
Now we're really fucked.

26:57.382 --> 26:59.748
Hey, hey, fuck you!

27:00.352 --> 27:02.479
Fuck you too, cabrone.

27:03.822 --> 27:06.188
Back to practice. Let's go!
