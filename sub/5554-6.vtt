WEBVTT

00:05.171 --> 00:07.104
WALTER:
<i> I'm Walter O'Brien.</i>

00:07.105 --> 00:09.038
<i> I run a team of geniuses</i>
<i> who handle worldwide threats</i>

00:09.041 --> 00:11.007
<i> only we can solve.</i>

00:11.009 --> 00:14.010
<i> Sylvester is</i>
<i> a human calculator.</i>

00:14.012 --> 00:15.177
<i> Happy's a mechanical prodigy.</i>

00:15.179 --> 00:17.712
<i> And Toby is our behaviorist.</i>

00:17.714 --> 00:20.181
<i> Agent Cabe Gallo</i>
<i> is our government handler.</i>

00:20.183 --> 00:22.349
<i> And Paige helps translates</i>
<i> the world for us</i>

00:22.351 --> 00:25.118
<i> while we help her understand</i>
<i> her genius son.</i>

00:25.120 --> 00:26.352
<i> Though sometimes</i>
<i> our biggest challenge</i>

00:26.354 --> 00:28.153
<i> is understanding each other.</i>

00:28.155 --> 00:30.254
<i> Together, we are Scorpion.</i>

00:33.626 --> 00:35.626
WALTER: Mr. Elia,
I can assure you

00:35.628 --> 00:38.395
I have taken
every imaginable precaution.

00:38.397 --> 00:40.029
Walter, how many times
do I have to say it?

00:40.031 --> 00:42.297
Mr. Elia is my dad.

00:42.299 --> 00:43.331
Sorry, Richard.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.666
(horn honking)
67 miles per hour,

00:45.668 --> 00:48.135
passing in three, two, one.
One, two, three.

00:49.605 --> 00:52.139
This morning
I completed

00:52.140 --> 00:54.674
the diagnostic on the building's
phone interpretation software,

00:54.676 --> 00:56.409
(horn honking) the climate
preferences, and personalized audio.

00:56.411 --> 00:57.743
Just hold on.

00:57.745 --> 00:59.578
Those were the only systems
that needed testing,

00:59.580 --> 01:01.179
and they passed
with flying colors.

01:01.181 --> 01:02.580
(whoops)

01:02.582 --> 01:04.114
I'm sure they did.
I guess I'm just more

01:04.116 --> 01:05.515
of a worrier than you are,
which is why we make

01:05.517 --> 01:07.049
a good team, right?
Mr. Elia...

01:07.051 --> 01:10.185
Richard, I do not do dangerous.

01:10.187 --> 01:13.054
I do calculations,
thereby eliminating risk.

01:13.056 --> 01:14.488
Walter, you sound

01:14.490 --> 01:16.690
like you're running
on the freeway.

01:16.692 --> 01:19.492
No. Not at the moment.

01:19.494 --> 01:21.227
Mr. Elia,
listen, I...

01:21.229 --> 01:23.829
I cannot tell you
how much this opportunity

01:23.831 --> 01:25.564
has meant to me and my team.

01:25.566 --> 01:27.399
We would never let you down.
Make sure you finish

01:27.401 --> 01:29.634
downloading the code
for the smart kitchen tech.

01:29.636 --> 01:32.203
See you tomorrow. 7:00 sharp.
Okay. Bye.

01:32.205 --> 01:34.538
Whew. That was intense!

01:34.540 --> 01:38.408
Man, didn't want
to lose this baby though. Right?

01:38.410 --> 01:39.609
Thanks for grabbing it. Sure.

01:39.611 --> 01:41.344
How'd the call with
the billionaire go?

01:41.346 --> 01:43.145
He's anxious
about tomorrow night.

01:43.147 --> 01:45.080
So are you.

01:45.082 --> 01:47.115
You look up to him.
You don't want to let him down.

01:47.116 --> 01:49.149
Well, he has
high expectations. So do I.

01:49.152 --> 01:50.684
It's all well and
good, Wally, but, listen,

01:50.686 --> 01:52.385
you need to relax
a bit, too, bro.

01:52.387 --> 01:54.253
Oh, hey, after you give the talk
at that tech conference tonight,

01:54.255 --> 01:56.255
you should go to that
little mixer thing after.

01:56.257 --> 01:57.689
Oh, no, I'm not the mixer type.
This guy

01:57.691 --> 02:00.291
you look up to, I'll bet
he's well-rounded, right?

02:00.293 --> 02:02.559
Life of the party,
easy line with the ladies.

02:02.561 --> 02:04.360
That is how you get
to the ivory tower.

02:04.362 --> 02:07.296
You just act like a
regular guy, be personable.

02:07.298 --> 02:09.364
Would also help with
your girlfriend, Pearl.

02:09.366 --> 02:11.466
Paige. And she's just my friend.
First rule

02:11.468 --> 02:13.234
of social mingling:
be self-deprecating.

02:13.236 --> 02:14.768
And if you happen
to chat up a lady,

02:14.770 --> 02:17.237
I want you to compliment her,
okay? But not on the standards.

02:17.239 --> 02:19.172
No hair, no eyes.
Just, you know,

02:19.174 --> 02:23.109
"Hey, wow. What
wonderful posture you have."

02:23.111 --> 02:25.177
Guarantee they've never heard
that before.

02:25.179 --> 02:26.511
Because that is
preposterous.

02:26.513 --> 02:27.578
It's gold.

02:27.580 --> 02:28.512
Trust me.

02:28.514 --> 02:30.514
Listen, I...

02:30.516 --> 02:32.883
am gonna make this
simple for you.

02:32.885 --> 02:34.885
Tonight, when in doubt, No.

02:34.887 --> 02:37.721
I want you to ask yourself, No.
Please...

02:37.723 --> 02:40.390
"What would Ray do?"

02:40.392 --> 02:41.657
Booyah.

02:44.294 --> 02:46.260
(dance music playing)

02:48.330 --> 02:50.296
(crowd cheering)

02:57.805 --> 02:59.571
(clears throat)

02:59.573 --> 03:01.406
Oh. (scoffs)

03:01.408 --> 03:04.776
Are you a-a recent sporting,
uh, contest?

03:04.778 --> 03:08.312
If I were you, I'd take a walk
to the other end of the bar.

03:08.314 --> 03:10.614
Great. (chuckles)

03:10.616 --> 03:12.582
I knew it. This guy Ray

03:12.584 --> 03:14.417
was suggesting I engage.

03:14.419 --> 03:17.153
No, dude, the girl
at the end of the bar.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.288
She's throwing you eyes.

03:24.328 --> 03:26.594
Yeah.
Yeah, I'll try it.

03:27.897 --> 03:31.364
I heard you're talking
superconducting electromagnets.

03:32.667 --> 03:34.166
Stimulating.

03:34.168 --> 03:35.934
No, it's been
highly caffeinated.

03:35.936 --> 03:37.268
I did hear snoring.

03:37.270 --> 03:39.937
(laughs)
Their loss.

03:40.873 --> 03:42.806
Has anybody ever told you

03:42.808 --> 03:45.742
that you have, uh,
perfectly rounded earlobes?

03:45.744 --> 03:47.610
It's a dominant
genetic trait.

03:47.612 --> 03:49.678
Oh, okay.

03:49.680 --> 03:51.379
Thank you?

03:51.381 --> 03:54.181
Do you want to see
a cool math trick?

03:54.183 --> 03:55.849
Who could turn that down?

04:03.358 --> 04:04.757
Okay, what is X?

04:07.394 --> 04:09.594
I think you need a drink.

04:09.596 --> 04:11.395
No, no, no, no, wait, wait.

04:12.364 --> 04:15.298
Ah, 87.

04:15.300 --> 04:16.866
This taught me to not
always accept things

04:16.868 --> 04:18.234
as they might first appear.

04:18.236 --> 04:20.703
Sometimes it's good to go
with your gut.

04:20.705 --> 04:21.537
BARTENDER:
What can I get you?

04:21.539 --> 04:22.371
Oh, no,

04:22.373 --> 04:23.939
I don't drink.

04:23.941 --> 04:25.373
Alcohol effects
my cognitive function.

04:25.375 --> 04:27.742
(chuckles)
Dry martini for me.

04:27.744 --> 04:30.211
And something sweet for...

04:30.213 --> 04:31.445
Oh, yeah, okay.

04:31.447 --> 04:33.513
Walter.

04:33.515 --> 04:35.498
Long Island iced tea?

04:35.499 --> 04:37.482
Caffeinated tea
can increase focus.

04:39.220 --> 04:40.852
You're different, aren't you?

04:40.854 --> 04:43.855
Just a regular guy.

04:43.857 --> 04:45.423
PAIGE:<i> Walter O'Brien would</i>
<i> never forget about tonight,</i>

04:45.425 --> 04:46.590
<i> Mr. Elia.</i>

04:46.592 --> 04:47.724
The building opening
is all Walter's

04:47.726 --> 04:49.258
been working toward for weeks.

04:49.260 --> 04:50.459
I'm going to guess
that he's neck-deep

04:50.461 --> 04:52.360
in trying to finish
the smart kitchen code

04:52.362 --> 04:54.495
and-and turned off his ringer.
He does that.

04:54.497 --> 04:57.264
As soon as he comes up for air,
I'll have him call you, okay?

04:57.266 --> 04:58.632
Okay, this is important.

04:58.633 --> 04:59.999
Thanks.
Where the hell is Walter?

05:00.002 --> 05:01.935
I can only hold off Elia
for so long.

05:01.936 --> 05:03.869
He's not answering his cell
or his hotel room phone.

05:03.872 --> 05:06.339
He's looking at the last of
the building specs, guaranteed.

05:06.341 --> 05:07.473
He'll be here any minute.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.191
Sly, hold this for me.
Okay.

05:09.192 --> 05:10.908
Is that for the Elia job?
Negative. Happy built me

05:10.911 --> 05:13.344
a personal humidor for
my Super Fun Guy comics.

05:13.346 --> 05:14.945
It controls temperature,
humidity,

05:14.947 --> 05:16.913
limits exposure to light
in order to prevent

05:16.915 --> 05:18.714
premature bleaching
of the covers.

05:18.716 --> 05:20.449
Humidor for your comics?

05:20.451 --> 05:22.451
Technically, it's a Super-dor.

05:22.453 --> 05:23.718
(sighs)

05:23.720 --> 05:24.719
Da-da-da-da-da.

05:24.721 --> 05:25.953
No dice, grabby hands.

05:25.955 --> 05:28.355
I've calculated a
precise monthly schedule

05:28.357 --> 05:30.623
for each comic to be perused
in order to ensure

05:30.625 --> 05:31.757
complete preservation.

05:31.759 --> 05:33.325
Four minutes, wearing gloves.

05:34.628 --> 05:36.027
I hate that look.

05:36.029 --> 05:37.795
It makes me feel like I'm
about to be diagnosed.

05:37.797 --> 05:39.930
Your submersion
into childhood interests

05:39.932 --> 05:41.298
indicates regression.

05:41.300 --> 05:42.799
Thank you.

05:42.801 --> 05:43.933
You're an enabler.

05:45.503 --> 05:47.035
This is a hobby.

05:47.037 --> 05:49.003
This must have something
to do with Megan.

05:49.005 --> 05:50.004
It's complicated.

05:50.006 --> 05:51.739
Yeah, life is complicated.

05:51.741 --> 05:53.474
Adult relationships
are complicated.

05:53.476 --> 05:55.542
This is your security
blanket, Linus.

05:55.544 --> 05:57.477
How about you

05:57.479 --> 05:58.878
avoiding adult relationships

05:58.880 --> 06:00.312
by pursuing
the one woman on earth

06:00.314 --> 06:01.613
who has no interest in you.

06:01.615 --> 06:03.715
Oh, please, I kicked that habit
cold turkey.

06:03.717 --> 06:06.451
I need Happy like
I need necrotizing fasciitis.

06:06.453 --> 06:08.820
You want me to prove it?

06:08.822 --> 06:10.822
I will. Watch me.

06:10.823 --> 06:12.823
CABE: Been trying to reach Walter.
It keeps going to voicemail.

06:12.826 --> 06:14.826
We're supposed to be to Elia's
in an hour.

06:14.828 --> 06:15.927
TOBY: Guys,
we've been slaving

06:15.929 --> 06:17.395
on this job for weeks,

06:17.397 --> 06:18.562
especially Walter.

06:18.564 --> 06:19.863
I'm sure he's...

06:19.865 --> 06:22.365
Yeah, I have no clue
where he could be.

06:23.735 --> 06:25.968
Let's take a ride.

06:33.310 --> 06:35.376
PAIGE: Walter?

06:36.312 --> 06:38.345
Oh, boy.

06:38.347 --> 06:41.514
He's passed out
on the floor.

06:41.516 --> 06:43.449
Fine, excellent.

06:43.451 --> 06:45.784
Oh, yeah,
you look real great, kid.

06:45.786 --> 06:47.018
It's not actual science,

06:47.020 --> 06:49.687
but I believe the phrase
is liquor before beer.

06:49.689 --> 06:51.822
Oh, I don't drink alcohol.

06:51.824 --> 06:53.790
I only had one
Rhode Island iced tea.

06:53.792 --> 06:54.891
Long Island iced tea.

06:54.893 --> 06:56.425
We got to get you ready.

06:56.427 --> 06:58.660
We're due at Elia's building
in 25 minutes.

06:58.662 --> 07:00.795
I only had one drink.

07:00.797 --> 07:02.930
Yeah, one drink
that you remember.

07:02.932 --> 07:04.398
You're just not used

07:04.399 --> 07:05.865
to the fire power
of the Long Island.

07:05.868 --> 07:07.901
Elia's been asking if you
finished the kitchen smart tech.

07:07.903 --> 07:09.736
Oh, boy.

07:09.738 --> 07:12.071
Yeah, I'm gonna
take care of it.

07:13.908 --> 07:16.608
Hmm, cell phone's dead,
room phone unplugged.

07:16.610 --> 07:17.909
Must have wanted privacy.

07:17.911 --> 07:19.844
I don't remember how I got here.

07:19.846 --> 07:21.078
Do you...

07:21.080 --> 07:23.346
smell perfume?

07:35.526 --> 07:36.992
(laughs)

07:36.994 --> 07:38.693
Okay, that's a good one.

07:38.695 --> 07:41.562
When was the last time you
saw Happy laugh at anything?

07:41.564 --> 07:43.830
I have made Happy laugh
a million times.

07:43.832 --> 07:45.665
Yeah,<i> at</i> you.

07:45.667 --> 07:46.899
She must be on with Chet.

07:46.901 --> 07:48.033
I mean, look at her expression.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.067
It looks like
she won the lottery

07:49.069 --> 07:50.535
or got nominated

07:50.537 --> 07:51.836
for some award or something.

07:51.838 --> 07:53.904
That's a big smile,
I got it.

07:55.073 --> 07:57.673
I know that you're skeptical,
but I'm good with this.

07:57.675 --> 08:00.042
I was totally fine
before Happy came into my life.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.943
You were a Dumpster fire.

08:02.879 --> 08:04.912
TOBY:
Wow, Walter,

08:04.914 --> 08:06.647
you look like me the day
after the Kentucky Derby.

08:06.649 --> 08:08.415
Are you ill? How ill?

08:08.417 --> 08:10.016
Just a cocktail flu.

08:10.018 --> 08:10.950
He's disease-free.

08:10.952 --> 08:11.951
We think.

08:11.953 --> 08:13.752
Let's just get inside.

08:13.754 --> 08:14.886
This is a big day

08:14.888 --> 08:16.387
for Scorpion.

08:16.389 --> 08:17.621
Thank you.

08:19.992 --> 08:21.491
I'm gonna get
my own door, thanks.

08:21.493 --> 08:23.159
It's an independence thing.

08:31.035 --> 08:32.467
You're welcome.

08:33.403 --> 08:35.069
ELIA:
<i> My dream was to create</i>

08:35.071 --> 08:37.838
the world's most
energy-efficient smart building

08:37.840 --> 08:40.440
that leaves
no negative footprint.

08:40.442 --> 08:44.076
Our new headquarters features
climate-responsive technology.

08:44.078 --> 08:46.545
Solar panels extend
from the building

08:46.547 --> 08:48.079
when touched by light.

08:48.081 --> 08:50.448
and the geothermal HVAC system
was designed

08:50.450 --> 08:52.049
using laminar air flow

08:52.051 --> 08:54.117
that creates completely
particle-free

08:54.119 --> 08:55.885
clean air environment.

08:55.887 --> 08:57.019
(applause)

08:57.021 --> 08:58.453
All of this was done

08:58.455 --> 09:00.755
using the input
of the world's top designers,

09:00.757 --> 09:03.924
architects
and the Scorpion team,

09:03.926 --> 09:05.425
led by Mr. Walter O'Brien.

09:05.427 --> 09:06.859
(applause)

09:06.861 --> 09:08.711
Hello.

09:08.712 --> 09:10.562
Please, I invite all of you
to tour the building,

09:10.564 --> 09:12.130
ask questions, and please,

09:12.132 --> 09:14.132
enjoy the food and drinks.

09:14.134 --> 09:17.134
Thanks for coming.

09:18.837 --> 09:20.002
Very good.

09:20.004 --> 09:21.737
You made it.
Oh, yeah, sorry.

09:21.738 --> 09:23.471
Forgive my cell
reception issues. Hello.

09:23.474 --> 09:24.739
I am just glad you're here.
Yes.

09:24.741 --> 09:26.040
This is my head of biometrics,

09:26.042 --> 09:27.074
Dan Smaisle.

09:27.076 --> 09:28.175
Oh, yes. Dan.

09:28.177 --> 09:29.609
Head of security,

09:29.611 --> 09:30.977
Wilson Adler.
Mr. O'Brien.

09:30.979 --> 09:32.979
You are? You look a little,
uh, flushed.

09:32.981 --> 09:34.814
Uh, never been better.

09:34.816 --> 09:37.616
Okay, because we have
a problem.

09:37.618 --> 09:40.752
WALTER:
<i> It is normal for people</i>

09:40.754 --> 09:43.054
to encounter
last-minute glitches,

09:43.056 --> 09:45.156
but all is gonna be handled
very soon.

09:45.158 --> 09:46.607
Of course,

09:46.608 --> 09:48.057
and maybe this is me
just worrying again,

09:48.060 --> 09:49.893
but I've been hawking
your prowess

09:49.895 --> 09:52.061
for the last month,
so you've got to come through.

09:52.063 --> 09:53.796
Tripling the tech budget
of a project

09:53.798 --> 09:56.999
three weeks before completion
does invite scrutiny.

09:57.001 --> 09:58.734
Guys, it's in the bag.

09:58.736 --> 10:01.002
Scorpion is synonymous
with professionalism.

10:01.004 --> 10:03.938
(pop song playing)

10:05.107 --> 10:07.006
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE: This is
the most frequently-played song

10:07.008 --> 10:10.476
of all music collections
in this elevator

10:10.478 --> 10:12.744
chosen from the playlist
of Tobias Curtis.

10:12.746 --> 10:14.078
This old girlfriend
downloaded it.

10:14.080 --> 10:15.479
I've never even listened to it.

10:15.481 --> 10:17.180
This song has been played

10:17.182 --> 10:19.248
17 times this week.

10:28.091 --> 10:29.190
The fish bubbles stopped.

10:29.192 --> 10:31.025
The ViviSpace projector
isn't working.

10:31.027 --> 10:33.193
Uh, you know, I set everything
up in here, so excuse me.

10:33.195 --> 10:35.028
An error message
keeps popping up.

10:35.030 --> 10:37.696
They are on it, Russell.
It's... my son.

10:39.866 --> 10:41.065
Oh, hey, Super Fun Guy fan?

10:41.067 --> 10:42.933
Very nice.  I'm
sure you've noticed

10:42.935 --> 10:45.669
that the room is freezing when
the thermostat says 70 degrees.

10:45.671 --> 10:47.137
We will have this
under control ASAP.

10:47.139 --> 10:49.139
I'll go glad-hand the press.

10:49.141 --> 10:51.107
Explain your absence.

10:51.109 --> 10:53.709
I went toe-to-toe with the board
to make this building happen.

10:53.711 --> 10:56.144
Those guys backed me. They're touchy.
Mm-hmm.

10:56.146 --> 10:57.678
Just wrap this up quietly

10:57.680 --> 10:59.680
and will be well.
Sure, sure.

10:59.682 --> 11:03.517
Sly, come here.

11:03.519 --> 11:06.653
Okay, guys... comms in.

11:06.655 --> 11:08.521
Happy, head to the basement

11:08.523 --> 11:12.057
pump room to inspect the
geothermal temperature system.

11:12.059 --> 11:13.124
Toby, evaluate the HVAC

11:13.126 --> 11:14.592
system on the roof.

11:14.594 --> 11:15.859
We are gonna
fix these glitches.

11:15.861 --> 11:18.094
There's no way
we're letting Elia down.

11:18.096 --> 11:19.646
Let's go.

11:19.647 --> 11:21.197
It's all right, Walter.
Glitches happen.

11:21.199 --> 11:22.865
I mean, you said
it yourself.

11:22.867 --> 11:24.933
Yeah, well, I was
just saying that because,

11:24.935 --> 11:26.768
in reality,
they don't happen to me.

11:26.770 --> 11:28.169
They happen to everyone.

11:28.171 --> 11:31.205
You might be on edge because
you're not feeling 100%.

11:31.207 --> 11:33.140
Probably didn't get a
lot of sleep last night

11:33.142 --> 11:34.941
Nothing untoward happened.

11:34.943 --> 11:36.275
Uh, oh, no, that's
none of my-my business.

11:36.277 --> 11:38.210
I'm just saying
regular people blow off steam.

11:38.212 --> 11:39.778
Nothing wrong
with being regular.

11:39.780 --> 11:41.780
Well, Elia, who is brilliant
and a billionaire,

11:41.782 --> 11:43.148
did not hire regular.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.150
Yeah.

11:45.152 --> 11:46.084
How's it going?

11:46.086 --> 11:48.786
I'm just running a quick check.

11:48.788 --> 11:50.087
(sharp beeping)

11:50.089 --> 11:52.222
Walter, what's going on?

11:52.224 --> 11:53.690
Building systems...

11:55.794 --> 11:57.660
are failing.
All of them.

11:57.662 --> 11:59.061
♪ ♪

11:59.063 --> 12:01.329
All right, fake Siri,
you made your point.

12:03.132 --> 12:05.298
You know, I'm not gonna stand
here and defend it to you.

12:05.300 --> 12:07.767
It's catchy, for one.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.702
It's classic
coming of age angst.

12:09.703 --> 12:11.636
And it reminds me of the summer
I made out with Susie Bren.

12:14.107 --> 12:15.940
Um...

12:15.942 --> 12:18.075
guys?

12:18.077 --> 12:19.209
The electrical system
for the elevator grid

12:19.211 --> 12:21.878
has shut down.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.513
Walter, I thought you said
you had this was control.

12:23.514 --> 12:25.147
Our programmable logic
controllers are under attack.

12:25.149 --> 12:26.781
It's behaving like Stuxnet.

12:26.783 --> 12:27.882
What?
It was a cyber-attack

12:27.884 --> 12:29.984
on Iranian nuclear capabilities.

12:29.986 --> 12:31.618
It burned out the whole system.

12:31.620 --> 12:34.187
Oh, no, it's introduced an
infected rootkit onto the PLC,

12:34.189 --> 12:37.156
it's modifying the codes,
it's giving unexpected commands.

12:37.158 --> 12:38.223
I got none of that.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.625
Building's been infected
by a worm.

12:40.627 --> 12:42.159
It's spreading swiftly.

12:42.161 --> 12:44.161
It's targeting
the individual systems.

12:44.163 --> 12:47.264
I recall that you insured
system protection against this.

12:47.266 --> 12:49.332
My code was designed

12:49.334 --> 12:51.334
to keep viruses like this out.

12:51.336 --> 12:54.770
I just, uh, I don't know
what's happening here.

12:54.772 --> 12:56.838
(alarm wailing)

12:58.608 --> 13:00.140
Uh, Walt, the geothermal pump

13:00.142 --> 13:02.842
has ramped up to hyper speed.

13:04.111 --> 13:06.344
And the motor just exploded!

13:07.280 --> 13:09.113
Okay, I got some
serious smoke down here.

13:09.115 --> 13:10.380
And no fire extinguisher.

13:10.382 --> 13:12.048
Okay, the sprinklers
and fire retardant

13:12.050 --> 13:13.282
should activate within seconds.

13:13.284 --> 13:15.050
Uh, okay, the flames
are getting bigger.

13:15.052 --> 13:16.618
And the sprinklers
aren't engaging.

13:16.620 --> 13:18.286
It's because of the worm.

13:20.857 --> 13:24.258
Okay, Walt, there are
embers flying here.

13:24.260 --> 13:26.827
I don't have to tell you
this is the building's lungs.

13:26.829 --> 13:28.361
It's a unidirectional
ventilation system,

13:28.363 --> 13:30.196
so the embers can
spread through the vents

13:30.198 --> 13:31.697
to anywhere in the building.

13:31.699 --> 13:34.399
My son is on the 17th floor.

13:34.401 --> 13:36.968
All right, Sylvester, get the
kids out of the building now.

13:36.970 --> 13:38.703
Okay, guys, uh, change of plans.

13:38.705 --> 13:40.137
We're gonna go downstairs
and get some fresh air.

13:40.139 --> 13:42.205
So come on.

13:44.142 --> 13:45.908
(sighs)

13:47.678 --> 13:50.411
Change of plans again. Everybody
just go back to where you were.

13:52.314 --> 13:53.680
What's going on?

13:53.682 --> 13:54.881
I don't
know.

13:54.883 --> 13:56.382
(whispers): Hey, Walter,
the doors are locked

13:56.384 --> 13:57.883
and we can't get out.

13:57.885 --> 14:00.185
What is the hold up?
Open those doors.

14:00.187 --> 14:02.754
WALTER: The worm is blocking me
at every turn. Something like

14:02.756 --> 14:05.223
a Stuxnet would have to have
been created externally

14:05.225 --> 14:07.291
and then inserted
into the system.

14:10.729 --> 14:12.962
PAIGE:
Walter?

14:12.964 --> 14:15.364
Okay, so according
to this diagnostic,

14:15.366 --> 14:19.034
the building system was
fully operational at 6:23 P.M.

14:19.036 --> 14:21.736
today and began
to falter at 6:25.

14:21.738 --> 14:24.071
During those
two minutes, I was

14:24.073 --> 14:25.939
installing the code
for the kitchen automation.

14:25.941 --> 14:28.908
So... this worm came from you?

14:28.910 --> 14:30.209
And how's that possible?
This is way

14:30.211 --> 14:32.144
too massive a file
to embedded in an e-mail.

14:32.146 --> 14:33.678
It had to have been
physically planted

14:33.680 --> 14:36.147
on my drive, but that
would have taken hours.

14:36.149 --> 14:38.949
And my computer's not been
out of my sight for...

14:40.285 --> 14:42.418
Stella.
Who?

14:42.420 --> 14:43.819
Was the woman, uh,

14:43.821 --> 14:44.986
that insisted I have that drink.

14:44.988 --> 14:46.053
But I only had one drink.

14:46.055 --> 14:47.087
What if she drugged me

14:47.089 --> 14:47.954
to get access to my laptop

14:47.956 --> 14:49.839
and then put that worm in?

14:49.840 --> 14:51.723
You went out drinking the night
before the launch?

14:51.726 --> 14:54.226
This is the work of some woman
in a bar? This sounds like

14:54.228 --> 14:57.028
a load of crap. You were
in charge of this system

14:57.030 --> 14:58.162
and now it is corrupted.

14:58.164 --> 14:59.997
You need to find
that woman.

14:59.999 --> 15:02.065
If we can get more information
on the coding of that virus,

15:02.067 --> 15:04.734
then I can stop it.
It all starts with her.

15:04.736 --> 15:06.435
Let's go.

15:11.074 --> 15:13.107
Come on!

15:13.109 --> 15:15.042
Okay, not good, Walter!

15:15.044 --> 15:17.143
Things are escalating down here.

15:20.148 --> 15:21.413
Guys, it's getting
a little smoky in here.

15:21.415 --> 15:24.115
Same thing is happening up here.

15:24.117 --> 15:25.382
This is my fault.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.283
How I was hacked.

15:27.285 --> 15:29.351
I'm the single point of failure.

15:40.396 --> 15:42.129
How does this happen with 50
of the top tech reporters

15:42.131 --> 15:45.799
downstairs? I don't think the
timing of this is a coincidence.

15:45.801 --> 15:48.501
Now, can you think of anyone who
would want to do this to you?

15:48.503 --> 15:50.102
Why are you so confident
that this is about us?

15:50.104 --> 15:51.736
Because this is not my
building or my launch.

15:51.738 --> 15:53.571
It's your technology.

15:53.572 --> 15:55.405
Whoever did this must know that
I'm an effective conduit to you.

15:55.408 --> 15:57.274
We'll make this
a two-pronged investigation.

15:57.276 --> 15:58.775
Our side, and yours.

15:58.777 --> 15:59.742
Regardless of the origin,

15:59.744 --> 16:01.343
I will fix this. Trust me.

16:01.345 --> 16:03.778
HAPPY: Walt, things are not
improving down here.

16:03.780 --> 16:05.479
And we could use
the fire department.

16:05.481 --> 16:06.813
They're on their way.

16:06.815 --> 16:07.880
(phone ringing)

16:07.882 --> 16:10.048
Yeah. Dan, where are you?

16:10.050 --> 16:11.783
Richard, I just walked out
to the car to get my phone.

16:11.785 --> 16:13.050
I can't get back in.

16:13.052 --> 16:15.152
And people are banging
on the lobby doors,

16:15.154 --> 16:16.319
trying to get out.

16:16.321 --> 16:20.122
(alarm wailing)

16:20.124 --> 16:22.290
Walt, bring me
the intercom speaker!

16:22.292 --> 16:23.891
Don't ask why!

16:23.893 --> 16:25.158
Okay. Yeah.

16:26.227 --> 16:27.125
Walt! What...

16:27.127 --> 16:28.993
what are you doing?
You...

16:30.162 --> 16:32.462
You gotta trust me.

16:34.766 --> 16:36.232
Toby, you out of
the elevator?

16:36.234 --> 16:38.100
Ah... No dice.

16:38.102 --> 16:40.068
The panels in the ceiling
only depress about half an inch.

16:40.070 --> 16:41.369
I can't get them fully open.

16:41.371 --> 16:43.037
Sylvester, what's your status?

16:43.039 --> 16:44.371
Scared. Anxious.
Worried.

16:44.373 --> 16:46.172
Tell the kids
it's gonna be okay.

16:46.174 --> 16:48.340
Actually, that's my status.

16:48.342 --> 16:49.841
Sylvester, remember
that you're the adult here.

16:49.843 --> 16:51.809
The kids are going to
look to you for help.

16:52.978 --> 16:54.811
Why are we stuck in here?

16:54.813 --> 16:56.813
It was probably just a glitch.

16:56.815 --> 16:57.914
It's okay, guys.

16:57.916 --> 16:59.782
We will be
out of here

16:59.784 --> 17:00.816
in a bit.

17:00.818 --> 17:01.834
(phone rings)
Paige?

17:01.835 --> 17:02.851
PAIGE:
We're driving to the hotel.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.786
Fill us in on this... Stella?

17:04.788 --> 17:06.120
Yeah, uh, dark hair,

17:06.122 --> 17:07.855
brown eyes, uh,
distinct dimples.

17:07.857 --> 17:09.557
Low waist-to-hip ratio...

17:09.558 --> 17:11.258
Walter, let's move on
past the physical.

17:11.260 --> 17:13.526
Not sure he has.

17:13.528 --> 17:15.127
Maybe you

17:15.129 --> 17:17.295
picked up something--
a napkin, a book of matches?

17:17.297 --> 17:18.996
Wait, wait, wait--
my clothes from last night--

17:18.998 --> 17:20.263
they're in Cabe's SUV,

17:20.265 --> 17:21.530
in the back, third row.

17:21.532 --> 17:22.831
Okay, I'll check through
your stuff.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.566
We'll call you back.

17:24.567 --> 17:26.300
In general, men can
be pretty clueless.

17:26.303 --> 17:28.803
Walter takes that
to another level.

17:28.805 --> 17:30.004
Oh, this glimpse of him,

17:30.006 --> 17:32.406
not in control, is insightful,
that's all.

17:37.412 --> 17:39.145
For example,
his shirt smells like

17:39.147 --> 17:40.647
the cheap perfume in his room.

17:40.648 --> 17:42.148
Maybe we can give it
to a scent-tracking dog

17:42.150 --> 17:43.915
who specializes in
finding sluts.

17:47.353 --> 17:48.418
(gasping)

17:48.420 --> 17:50.553
We have to stop the fire before

17:50.555 --> 17:52.855
the embers are sucked
into the vents

17:52.857 --> 17:54.089
and spread
all over the building.

17:54.091 --> 17:55.423
I'm not painting my nails here.

17:55.425 --> 17:57.591
We're going to use the
low-frequency sound waves

17:57.593 --> 17:59.493
to kill the flames.

17:59.494 --> 18:01.394
If we blast a song
between 30 and 60 hertz,

18:01.396 --> 18:03.462
it can separate the
oxygen from the fire

18:03.464 --> 18:04.596
and keep it from reigniting.

18:04.598 --> 18:06.064
We have to move now, Happy.

18:06.066 --> 18:09.099
I am moving
as fast as I can, O'Brien.

18:10.502 --> 18:11.567
(hip-hop beat throbbing)

18:11.569 --> 18:13.001
Okay, stand back.

♪ ♪

18:25.248 --> 18:26.981
Ah, it's not strong enough.

18:28.184 --> 18:29.917
Okay, it's too hot
to get closer.

18:29.919 --> 18:32.119
We have to increase the
size of the gain horn.

18:32.121 --> 18:33.553
We don't have time.
I'll get it closer.

18:33.555 --> 18:35.354
No! You're gonna burn
your face off.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.024
Finally! Got it.

18:45.397 --> 18:46.863
(coughing)

18:46.865 --> 18:48.598
This is taking too long!

18:48.600 --> 18:50.100
Every second the fire spreads,

18:50.101 --> 18:51.601
the higher the risk of embers
spreading through the vents.

18:51.603 --> 18:53.302
Okay, Walt, stop!

18:53.304 --> 18:54.936
(hip-hop beat
continues throbbing)

19:00.310 --> 19:02.943

19:02.945 --> 19:04.244
It's working.

Uh, Walt, you're on fire!

19:17.322 --> 19:18.954
(Walter screams)

19:22.259 --> 19:24.459
Come on...
(Walter gasping)

19:28.597 --> 19:29.763
WALTER:
The fire's out.

19:29.764 --> 19:30.930
We have to get
to the control room.

19:33.935 --> 19:35.935
(Walter coughing)

19:35.936 --> 19:37.936
Hey! You do realize
this isn't your fault.

19:37.939 --> 19:39.638
I'm socially vulnerable.

19:39.640 --> 19:42.040
The perfect mark for an
attractive woman at the bar.

19:42.042 --> 19:44.475
This is absolutely my fault
and I'm gonna fix it.

19:47.313 --> 19:49.179
Did you put it out
with your bare hands?

19:49.181 --> 19:50.580
HAPPY:
Close.

19:50.582 --> 19:52.982
Okay, now that the pump room
fire is under control,

19:52.984 --> 19:55.184
we can tackle each
failing system one by one.

19:56.921 --> 19:58.453
Let him handle it, okay?

19:59.956 --> 20:02.189
I feel like we just interrupted
a conversation. About us.

20:02.191 --> 20:03.557
In all honesty,
we were discussing

20:03.559 --> 20:05.442
how unlikely it is that someone

20:05.443 --> 20:07.326
from our side of the company
would commit sabotage.

20:07.329 --> 20:08.995
We have drawn no conclusions.

20:08.997 --> 20:10.563
We just want the
building under control.

20:10.565 --> 20:12.031
Good.

20:13.200 --> 20:14.265
You got burned.

20:18.337 --> 20:19.369
MAN:
Sorry.

20:25.243 --> 20:26.342
Vrakas.

20:26.344 --> 20:27.142
Who?

20:27.144 --> 20:28.376
Call Paige and Cabe.

20:28.378 --> 20:29.477
It was Jon Vrakas
that steered me

20:29.479 --> 20:30.945
to this Stella person.

20:30.947 --> 20:32.446
Sounds like a long shot.

20:32.448 --> 20:34.214
Walter, if the fire
is still out,

20:34.216 --> 20:35.715
how come there's smoke still
coming through the vents?

20:35.717 --> 20:37.683
The geothermal system
should be back online.

20:37.685 --> 20:40.519
Any residual smoke
should clear up momentarily.

20:40.521 --> 20:42.254
Dan, what can you tell me?

20:42.255 --> 20:43.988
DAN: Firefighters have tried
to get into the building,

20:43.991 --> 20:46.424
but the anti-terrorism
protocols are impenetrable.

20:46.426 --> 20:49.193
No, no... i-it, it's-it's okay,
we have a little time.

20:49.195 --> 20:51.128
The fire is contained.

20:51.130 --> 20:52.395
The fire has not
been contained.

20:52.397 --> 20:53.396
Not by a long shot.

20:53.398 --> 20:55.131
Put on the news.

20:57.068 --> 20:59.468
WOMAN: Fire has broken out
at Richard Elia's headquarters.

20:59.470 --> 21:01.069
Reports are coming in

21:01.071 --> 21:03.504
that the firefighters cannot get
into the building.

21:03.506 --> 21:07.074
The embers spread through the
vents and ignited those floors.

21:07.076 --> 21:09.142
That's just under the game
room. My son is in there.

21:09.144 --> 21:10.510
Get a truck and
smash through

21:10.512 --> 21:12.345
those damn anti-terror
blockades!

21:12.347 --> 21:13.713
That is what
they're designed

21:13.715 --> 21:16.015
to prevent.
No one will get through.

21:16.017 --> 21:17.517
SYLVESTER:
We're sealed in by

21:17.518 --> 21:19.018
tempered glass windows
and a locked fire door.

21:19.020 --> 21:22.154
WALTER: Okay, Sylvester, I am
gonna find a way to get you out.

21:22.156 --> 21:26.290
Just trust me. All of you,
please just... trust me.

21:27.726 --> 21:29.559
(typing rapidly)

21:29.561 --> 21:31.027
SYLVESTER:
Okay, guys,

21:31.029 --> 21:32.661
we're gonna be just fine.

21:34.464 --> 21:36.163
I don't know anything
about a guy being drugged.

21:36.165 --> 21:37.631
Just please,
low voices.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.633
When you yell,
it's like a hammer to my skull.

21:39.635 --> 21:41.001
Focus fast, Mr. Vrakas,

21:41.003 --> 21:42.535
or we can do
that hammer thing for real.

21:42.537 --> 21:44.470
Did you steer him
to a girl at a bar?

21:44.472 --> 21:46.071
Yeah.

21:46.073 --> 21:47.556
Why'd you do that?

21:47.557 --> 21:49.040
She seemed interested.
So did he.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.307
How much so?

21:50.309 --> 21:52.042
All right, let's circle
back to that.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.544
Did you know her?

21:53.545 --> 21:55.045
Never met her before.
We were just partying.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.130
And I'm no expert
on the subject,

21:57.131 --> 21:59.214
but I don't know about your guy
being blacked out or drugged.

21:59.217 --> 22:00.416
He was raging. For hours.

22:00.418 --> 22:02.284
This guy was raging?

22:02.286 --> 22:03.585
Buying rounds,

22:03.587 --> 22:04.719
telling jokes.
He was on fire.

22:04.721 --> 22:06.754
Yeah, it's real farfetched, pal.

22:06.756 --> 22:08.222
I remember one of the jokes.

22:08.224 --> 22:09.790
If an optimist sees
a cup as half full,

22:09.792 --> 22:11.625
and a pessimist sees it
as half empty,

22:11.627 --> 22:12.792
what does the engineer see?

22:12.794 --> 22:15.027
A cup that's too big by half.

22:15.029 --> 22:16.461
He tells that
joke all the time.

22:16.463 --> 22:18.563
Hardly a joke. Yeah,
it's not funny at all.

22:18.565 --> 22:20.482
But, you know,
you learn something.

22:20.483 --> 22:22.400
Bottom line, your dude had
a few too many and hooked up.

22:22.402 --> 22:24.068
Okay, you can shut up now, okay?

22:24.070 --> 22:25.769
All right.
We're done.

22:25.771 --> 22:27.704
Walter partying? Macking
some random woman?

22:27.706 --> 22:29.806
Is there a world where
that actually happened?

22:29.808 --> 22:31.808
We just got
the opinion of one guy.

22:31.810 --> 22:34.076
Security should have pulled
the surveillance by now,

22:34.078 --> 22:36.611
and we'll get the truth.

22:36.613 --> 22:41.182
So... does anybody here know
any good camp fire songs?

22:41.184 --> 22:42.816
My eyes itch.

22:42.818 --> 22:43.817
When are we gonna
get out of here?

22:43.819 --> 22:45.151
Soon.

22:45.153 --> 22:46.418
(coughing)

22:46.420 --> 22:48.353
My throat hurts.

22:48.355 --> 22:50.822
Okay.

22:50.824 --> 22:52.356
Okay. Think.

22:52.358 --> 22:55.158
What would the team do
if they were here right now?

22:55.160 --> 22:56.659
Walter would probably
tell me to focus

22:56.661 --> 22:59.328
on the first evident problem,
which is smoke inhalation.

22:59.330 --> 23:01.163
Toby would
probably just annoy me.

23:01.165 --> 23:03.231
And Happy...

23:04.834 --> 23:07.067
Happy would build something.

23:07.069 --> 23:09.102
Like smoke filtration masks.

23:09.104 --> 23:11.170
Okay, kids, this will
only be a second.

23:26.119 --> 23:29.120
(Sylvester panting)

23:29.122 --> 23:30.221
(coughs)

23:30.223 --> 23:32.723
WALTER:
<i> This is insanity!</i>

23:32.725 --> 23:34.124
The second
I rebuild a code bridge,

23:34.126 --> 23:35.391
the worm corrupts it behind me.

23:35.393 --> 23:36.759
I'm really starting to doubt

23:36.761 --> 23:38.427
that you are the right man
for this job.

23:38.429 --> 23:40.279
HAPPY: Oh, you think
you can handle it?

23:40.280 --> 23:42.130
What age did you win the coding Olympics?
ELIA: Okay, enough!

23:42.132 --> 23:44.665
Walter, you told me
to trust you. I do.

23:44.667 --> 23:46.700
What are your ideas?

23:46.701 --> 23:48.734
We have to completely reboot
the system from the server.

23:48.737 --> 23:50.403
Revert to your original program.
Yeah.

23:50.405 --> 23:52.471
Then we can
restart the system, bit by bit,

23:52.473 --> 23:54.372
without the worm. Then
we can open the vents,

23:54.374 --> 23:56.107
start the sprinklers,
kill the fire.

23:56.109 --> 23:57.341
Hold on. Hold on.
Please. Please.

23:57.343 --> 23:58.542
We are talking
about literally

23:58.544 --> 24:00.176
unplugging the brains
of the building.

24:00.178 --> 24:01.443
Yes. If we're unable to reboot,

24:01.445 --> 24:03.111
we are hopeless.
I understand.

24:03.113 --> 24:05.213
We are sealed. My son will be trapped.
I'm aware of that.

24:05.215 --> 24:06.280
Can't blame a man
for worrying about his son.

24:06.282 --> 24:07.514
We're all worried.

24:09.618 --> 24:11.551
Then let's go. Now.

24:11.553 --> 24:13.219
Thank you.

24:14.155 --> 24:16.822
See, this is fun. We're

24:16.824 --> 24:19.457
learning how
to do different things.

24:19.459 --> 24:22.326
Making a mask from
a dismantled charcoal filter.

24:22.328 --> 24:24.394
(coughing)

24:24.396 --> 24:26.229
Can anybody tell me
what activated charcoal is?

24:26.231 --> 24:27.496
(coughing)

24:27.498 --> 24:29.164
It's carbon
that's been treated

24:29.166 --> 24:30.798
with oxygen
to open up the millions

24:30.800 --> 24:32.499
of tiny pores between

24:32.501 --> 24:33.833
the carbon atoms.

24:33.835 --> 24:35.301
And those tiny pores
attract chemicals

24:35.303 --> 24:36.669
like the particles in smoke?

24:36.671 --> 24:40.339
Yes! Now, you tell me
this isn't just like camp.

24:40.341 --> 24:41.757
(coughing)

24:41.758 --> 24:43.174
Except for the choking to death.

24:43.177 --> 24:46.211
You're a real wit, Russell,
but we're not choking to death.

24:46.213 --> 24:48.346
We're just uncomfortable.

24:49.649 --> 24:52.383
Coughing is uncomfortable,
choking is uncomfortable.

24:52.385 --> 24:54.218
Plunging headfirst into

24:54.220 --> 24:57.454
a tank full of fish feces
and food bits is,

24:57.456 --> 24:59.522
for me,
off the uncomfortable scale.

24:59.524 --> 25:01.724
But it is something
that we will all accept

25:01.726 --> 25:04.359
because we are mature.

25:04.361 --> 25:06.194
Right?

25:06.196 --> 25:07.828
I'm just... open a...

25:07.830 --> 25:09.462
Want to help me?

25:09.464 --> 25:11.263
Thank you.

25:15.935 --> 25:17.701
See?

25:18.737 --> 25:20.169
Everybody's gonna be fine.

25:21.739 --> 25:24.205
Okay, the server room
is five floors up.

25:26.876 --> 25:29.209
The building's water pressure
and temperature's

25:29.211 --> 25:30.577
controlled by
the automated system.

25:30.579 --> 25:32.445
That steam's
over 200 degrees.

25:33.381 --> 25:34.713
Okay, good thing we missed that.

25:34.715 --> 25:37.549
Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

25:37.551 --> 25:39.517
That was close.

25:39.519 --> 25:42.253
Looks like the worm
is following us.

25:42.255 --> 25:44.338
It's malicious.

25:44.339 --> 25:46.422
All the tech in the building
that ran facial recognition

25:46.425 --> 25:48.758
to-to pick our favorite songs
or monitor room temperature

25:48.760 --> 25:51.260
is now guessing
where we are and attacking.

25:51.262 --> 25:52.961
Like it was designed
to make the tech look bad.

25:52.963 --> 25:54.696
Yeah, well, we don't have time
to just stand around here.

25:54.698 --> 25:56.230
I can run through it.

25:56.232 --> 25:56.964
Okay, are you crazy?!

25:56.966 --> 25:58.498
You're gonna melt your skin!

25:58.500 --> 26:00.766
Why are you so determined
to kill yourself?

26:00.768 --> 26:02.634
Toby, where
the hell are you?

26:02.636 --> 26:06.237
I made my way out of
the elevator-- solo, thank you.

26:06.239 --> 26:07.538
What floor are you on?

26:07.540 --> 26:09.406
15.
Okay, perfect.

26:09.408 --> 26:10.857
Head to the server room.

26:10.858 --> 26:12.307
Now, we'll try and meet you,
but if you beat us,

26:12.310 --> 26:14.410
we will talk you through
the reboot protocol.

26:14.412 --> 26:15.644
I'm on my way.

26:15.646 --> 26:16.611
(grunts)

26:16.613 --> 26:17.845
Ta-da!

26:17.847 --> 26:20.280
Ooh, my lingula.

26:34.496 --> 26:35.695
Guys, I don't think
I'm making it

26:35.697 --> 26:37.363
to the server room
any time soon.

26:46.406 --> 26:48.439
Would you look at that?

26:48.441 --> 26:50.808
If I wasn't seeing it,
I wouldn't believe it.

26:50.810 --> 26:52.543
That's where he ordered
a round of shots.

26:52.545 --> 26:54.711
I want drinks for everyone!

26:54.713 --> 26:56.345
It's like he's possessed
by some evil spirit

26:56.347 --> 26:58.313
that's in a fraternity.

26:58.315 --> 27:00.448
Back up the footage
to when he first gets the drink.

27:00.450 --> 27:02.716
Back up, back up.

27:02.718 --> 27:04.017
Keep going... Stop!

27:04.019 --> 27:05.985
All right, keep your eyes
on the girl's hands,

27:05.987 --> 27:09.321
and see if she slips him
anything into his drink.

27:09.323 --> 27:12.457
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

27:12.459 --> 27:14.392
It's out of frame
at the crucial moment.

27:14.394 --> 27:16.427
I can't see if she put
anything in his glass.

27:16.429 --> 27:18.429
It's really...

27:18.431 --> 27:19.630
Was she acting odd?

27:19.632 --> 27:21.632
No.

27:21.633 --> 27:23.633
She did turn down a few guys
before this one showed up.

27:23.636 --> 27:25.802
CABE: Well, maybe she
was waiting for him.

27:25.804 --> 27:27.470
Or she's just picky
and likes math humor.

27:27.472 --> 27:29.271
If she wasn't specifically
targeting Walter,

27:29.273 --> 27:31.039
then that means
he was just wrong?

27:31.041 --> 27:32.874
That he just somehow messed up

27:32.876 --> 27:34.442
the programming
at that building.

27:34.444 --> 27:36.461
Is that what we're saying?

27:36.462 --> 27:38.479
We're investigating,
so we're looking at every angle.

27:38.481 --> 27:40.647
Her purse!
Stop the footage?

27:43.485 --> 27:45.651
Yeah, Clementine Gym.

27:45.653 --> 27:46.885
Super fancy,
it costs a fortune.

27:46.887 --> 27:48.620
I think Gwyneth Paltrow
goes there.

27:48.622 --> 27:50.421
They'll have
this woman's photo on file.

27:53.025 --> 27:56.493
What the hell's
keeping you guys?!

27:56.495 --> 27:59.462
The vindictive steam pipes
seem to recognize us!

28:16.581 --> 28:18.647
Oh, boy.

28:20.384 --> 28:21.716
Aah!

28:24.954 --> 28:27.620
(shouting gibberish)

28:29.690 --> 28:31.723
Look at me, Mr. Self-Sufficient.

28:31.725 --> 28:33.691
Just got here on my own.

28:33.693 --> 28:35.459
No one helped me,
just so you know.

28:35.461 --> 28:37.594
Okay, what the hell's wrong
with the men on this team today?

28:37.596 --> 28:39.495
I'm totally fine.

28:39.497 --> 28:40.662
I'm fine on my own.

28:40.664 --> 28:42.030
Walter,
I'm at the server controls.

28:42.032 --> 28:44.065
Okay, I'm gonna walk you
through the reboot protocols.

28:44.067 --> 28:45.499
So, there's server blades
in the back.

28:45.501 --> 28:47.501
We're gonna be up there
in a minute,

28:47.503 --> 28:48.902
but we don't have
a minute to waste.

28:48.904 --> 28:50.536
Okay, Walter,
I'm at the server blades.

28:50.538 --> 28:51.787
(rapid beeping)

28:51.788 --> 28:53.037
Don't like the sound of that.

28:53.040 --> 28:54.506
Sound of what?

28:54.508 --> 28:55.691
Oh, the worm.

28:55.692 --> 28:56.875
The servers are
spinning too fast.

28:56.877 --> 28:58.610
They're overheating.
It's the same as Stuxnet.

28:58.612 --> 29:01.512
It's designed to attack
programmable logic controllers.

29:01.514 --> 29:03.413
If it spins too fast,
it will ignite.

29:03.415 --> 29:04.547
Walter, it's louder.

29:04.549 --> 29:06.515
Okay, Toby,
get the hell out of there!

29:06.517 --> 29:07.949
Oh! Oh!

29:07.951 --> 29:09.983
(grunting)

29:13.088 --> 29:14.954
Aah!

29:14.956 --> 29:17.488
Toby, now!

29:19.859 --> 29:23.560
What's happening here?

29:23.562 --> 29:25.628
It seals to contain the fire.

29:25.630 --> 29:27.696
The one damned fire protocol
that's working.

29:27.698 --> 29:29.664
That's nice.
Now get me out of here!

29:29.666 --> 29:32.533
Get back!

29:32.535 --> 29:35.068
This isn't working!

29:35.070 --> 29:37.470
What's the plan? We can't just
sit here and watch him cook.

29:41.843 --> 29:43.542
Come on, what's that look?

29:43.544 --> 29:44.976
Okay, so the server room
is protected

29:44.978 --> 29:46.811
by a hypoxic
air technology system.

29:46.813 --> 29:49.513
It sucks the oxygen out
of the room to kill the fire.

29:49.515 --> 29:51.581
Yeah, but wouldn't doing that
also kill the Toby?

29:51.583 --> 29:53.566
They system's down now,
because of the worm.

29:53.567 --> 29:55.550
But there's a manual
override right over there!

29:55.553 --> 29:57.519
I engage it,
I-I put out that fire,

29:57.521 --> 29:59.687
I save the building and everyone in it.
Except me.

29:59.689 --> 30:01.755
Toby, listen--
No, no, no, you listen!

30:01.757 --> 30:03.556
You cannot suck the air
out of this room, Walter!

30:03.558 --> 30:06.425
You even say the words
"greater good" and I swear--

30:06.427 --> 30:08.794
If the server is gone, then
we will never open the doors,

30:08.796 --> 30:10.462
we will never get
the sprinklers working,

30:10.464 --> 30:11.930
and everyone
in the building will die!

30:13.867 --> 30:16.434
But there's a very good chance
that we could revive you.

30:16.436 --> 30:19.003
Okay, you've been making
too many rash moves today,

30:19.005 --> 30:21.038
and I'm not let you
make another one!

30:21.040 --> 30:22.406
TOBY:
You're showing guilt markers.

30:22.407 --> 30:23.773
You feel responsible
for this fiasco.

30:23.776 --> 30:26.510
You're taking undue risk.

30:26.512 --> 30:28.445
No, no, no, no, no!
Stay away from that panel!

30:28.447 --> 30:29.979
I have a method
to douse the flames.

30:29.981 --> 30:31.413
I thought of all by myself.

30:31.415 --> 30:33.982
Huh?!

30:35.585 --> 30:37.651
(grunting)

30:42.424 --> 30:43.823
Yeah, what?!
Who are you?

30:43.825 --> 30:44.790
We need a minute. Now.

30:46.560 --> 30:48.593
I just saw a guy,
I thought he was cute.

30:48.595 --> 30:49.794
We talked
and went back to his room.

30:49.796 --> 30:51.061
How did you end up
in that bar?

30:51.063 --> 30:52.729
I saw a few
of the presentations.

30:52.731 --> 30:54.597
Just fascinated by tech?

30:54.599 --> 30:56.732
It's what I'm studying
at Long Beach.

30:56.734 --> 30:57.866
Saw the presentation,
and then what?

30:57.868 --> 30:59.267
I got a drink.

30:59.268 --> 31:00.667
You don't seem like someone
who would have an agenda

31:00.670 --> 31:01.735
against Richard Elia's company.

31:01.737 --> 31:02.836
More like the
opposite.

31:02.838 --> 31:04.871
I would love to work
for the guy one day.

31:04.873 --> 31:06.739
So if someone paid you to slip
our guy a little something?

31:06.741 --> 31:08.741
Never happened.

31:08.743 --> 31:10.142
You get that we're talking
about a building on fire

31:10.144 --> 31:11.810
with kids trapped inside?

31:11.812 --> 31:13.111
CABE: And that the worm that was
planted in Walter's computer

31:13.113 --> 31:15.780
is so destructive,
without the original code,

31:15.782 --> 31:17.481
he's having a hell of a time
getting rid of it.

31:17.483 --> 31:18.748
I don't know anything
about that--

31:18.750 --> 31:19.782
You had a drink

31:19.784 --> 31:20.816
and went back
to his room?

31:20.818 --> 31:22.651
Yes.
And then what?

31:22.653 --> 31:25.487
And then... Are you
his girlfriend or something?

31:25.489 --> 31:27.789
I am his friend-slash-colleague,
and we are trying to save lives.

31:27.791 --> 31:29.457
CABE: You understand that
I'm a Homeland agent.

31:29.459 --> 31:31.459
I'm gonna run your
computer and cell records.

31:31.461 --> 31:32.860
If you have anything
to do with this,

31:32.862 --> 31:34.094
we're gonna find
out about it.

31:34.096 --> 31:35.628
I don't roofie people.

31:35.630 --> 31:37.796
Especially not your
"friend-slash-colleague."

31:37.798 --> 31:39.464
PAIGE:
<i> I don't believe her.</i>

31:39.466 --> 31:41.899
What if we run this girl's
records, but nothing pops?

31:41.901 --> 31:43.767
Then our prospects
of proving Walter was drugged

31:43.769 --> 31:45.269
are not looking good.

31:45.270 --> 31:46.770
And if, God forbid,
someone dies in that building

31:46.772 --> 31:48.805
and it looks like it was
because of Walter's software,

31:48.807 --> 31:50.890
that's homicide.

31:50.891 --> 31:52.974
Walter, he... he would
never just make a mistake.

31:52.977 --> 31:55.477
Don't we all make mistakes?

31:55.479 --> 31:56.911
(alarm beeping)

32:03.118 --> 32:04.917
Toby, we're seconds away
from losing the server!

32:04.919 --> 32:05.884
(alarm continues beeping)

32:05.886 --> 32:07.685
I can fight it!

32:09.655 --> 32:10.186
No, don't!

32:10.188 --> 32:12.488
(alarm blaring)

32:12.490 --> 32:13.856
I promise this will work.

32:13.858 --> 32:16.959
(alarm continues blaring)

32:16.961 --> 32:19.695
He will not have oxygen
for a very short period of time.

32:20.931 --> 32:21.930
(muffled):
Walter!

32:21.932 --> 32:23.515
As soon as this fire's out,

32:23.516 --> 32:25.099
I turn it off and I manually
blast in O2, okay?

32:31.173 --> 32:32.839
That's enough!

32:32.841 --> 32:34.574
The flames are dying!
No, they're not dead yet!

32:34.576 --> 32:35.641
Just ten more seconds!

32:37.077 --> 32:40.044
You hit the room with air now,
and the server could reignite.

32:40.046 --> 32:42.880
Ten, nine, eight...

32:42.882 --> 32:45.916
You got a lot of balls
killing me, O'Brien.

32:45.918 --> 32:47.183
I will rise again.

32:47.185 --> 32:48.684
...five...

32:49.987 --> 32:51.886
Walt, we got to get in there!
...four, three,

32:51.888 --> 32:54.755
two, one.

32:55.724 --> 32:57.824
(beeping)

32:57.826 --> 32:59.025
It's not working.

33:01.896 --> 33:03.996
Okay, it didn't work!

33:03.998 --> 33:06.565
He's gonna suffocate!

33:07.534 --> 33:08.833
Hey, Walter!

33:08.835 --> 33:11.135
He's dying in there!

33:11.137 --> 33:12.136
What the hell did you do?!

33:12.138 --> 33:13.570
He's dying in there!

33:27.852 --> 33:29.818
HAPPY: Walt, the
doc's turning blue.

33:29.820 --> 33:31.719
Are you hearing me?
(alarm continues blaring)

33:31.721 --> 33:33.687
The air's being
sucked out of his lungs.

33:33.689 --> 33:35.822
"The air's being sucked
out of his lungs."

33:35.824 --> 33:37.623
We don't need
to smash the glass.

33:37.625 --> 33:39.224
The vacuum will do it.

33:39.226 --> 33:41.593
HAPPY: We just have to crack
the glass a fraction of an inch.

33:41.595 --> 33:43.795
The vacuum-pull on compromised
glass will shatter it.

33:43.797 --> 33:46.764
Except anything that we throw
against it bounces off.

33:46.766 --> 33:47.898
Yeah, well, bullet-resistant
glass is layered.

33:47.900 --> 33:49.232
That's why it
bends on impact.

33:49.234 --> 33:51.234
We just need something
to pierce it.

33:51.236 --> 33:53.236
A laser, a needle--
something extremely dense.

33:53.238 --> 33:54.637
Tungsten carbide!

33:54.639 --> 33:55.988
When you first met him,

33:55.989 --> 33:57.338
Elia gave you a pen
that's made out of TC.

33:57.341 --> 33:59.140
The one you wouldn't let
Toby touch because you were

33:59.142 --> 34:00.141
too proud of it.
He would've lost it.

34:00.143 --> 34:01.308
Okay, we need a slingshot.

34:01.310 --> 34:02.709
Ah! Scissors, scissors!

34:05.880 --> 34:08.013
It's a little bit odd
that there are billions

34:08.015 --> 34:09.714
in modern electronics
in this building,

34:09.716 --> 34:11.615
and we're solving these
problems with technology

34:11.617 --> 34:12.716
that David used
to beat Goliath.

34:13.685 --> 34:15.818
All right, stand back.
All right.

34:22.826 --> 34:24.692
(alarm continues blaring)

34:24.694 --> 34:26.760
Not good.

34:28.163 --> 34:29.896
Wait for it.

34:37.738 --> 34:39.804
Okay, don't bother
yourself helping me.

34:39.806 --> 34:40.704
There's no efficiency difference

34:40.706 --> 34:43.907
between one-
and two-man CPR.

34:48.946 --> 34:50.378
Okay, come on.

34:50.380 --> 34:51.645
Breathe, Toby.

34:52.848 --> 34:54.814
(coughing)

34:57.118 --> 34:58.851
I could've...

34:58.853 --> 35:00.118
Yeah, you could've died,
but you didn't.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.819
I could've done that on my own.

35:01.821 --> 35:03.987
You're a lunatic.

35:03.989 --> 35:05.955
Okay, I do not think that
there was significant damage

35:05.957 --> 35:07.490
done to the server.

35:07.491 --> 35:09.024
This should restore
our programming

35:09.026 --> 35:11.026
to settings prior
to the worm attack.

35:11.028 --> 35:12.861
I'm happy to be alive,
thank you, Walter.

35:12.863 --> 35:14.162
But how are you feeling?

35:15.131 --> 35:17.030
Okay, so once we reboot
the system,

35:17.032 --> 35:19.932
we can put out the fire
and get Sylvester

35:19.934 --> 35:21.700
and the kids
out to safety.

35:23.704 --> 35:25.821
SYLVESTER:
Stay low.

35:25.822 --> 35:27.939
Air quality is better
closer to the floor.

35:27.941 --> 35:30.308
Do we know exactly
what's burning below us?

35:30.310 --> 35:31.409
Good question.

35:31.411 --> 35:32.843
Not sure.

35:32.845 --> 35:34.094
Walter,

35:34.095 --> 35:35.344
please tell me
you have some news.

35:35.347 --> 35:36.779
Yeah. Getting there.

35:36.781 --> 35:39.314
We're close!

35:39.316 --> 35:40.315
RUSSELL:
I learned in school

35:40.317 --> 35:41.783
that when some things burn,

35:41.785 --> 35:43.251
they give off toxic chemicals.

35:43.253 --> 35:45.419
You look on the dark side.

35:45.421 --> 35:48.822
So do I, but I'm learning
that life is a mix

35:48.824 --> 35:50.824
of both good and bad.

35:50.826 --> 35:52.859
(mechanical thump)

35:54.762 --> 35:55.861
See?

35:55.863 --> 35:58.096
Positivity's practically
my middle name.

35:58.098 --> 36:00.482
So we're rebooting
system by system,

36:00.483 --> 36:02.867
starting with ventilation
and then the doors.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.268
Make sure the firefighters
are ready.

36:04.270 --> 36:05.969
They'll have access

36:05.971 --> 36:07.770
in 20 seconds.

36:07.772 --> 36:09.171
20 seconds!

36:11.842 --> 36:12.841
(laughs)

36:12.843 --> 36:14.375
Yeah!
(sighs)

36:14.377 --> 36:15.376
Yeah!

36:15.378 --> 36:16.443
The sprinklers are operational!

36:16.445 --> 36:19.245
(electronics powering up)

36:22.316 --> 36:25.350
(pop music playing
over speakers)

36:27.787 --> 36:30.254
Hey, Walter, while
we have 20 seconds.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.289
What's this about?

36:32.291 --> 36:34.190
Something not your business,
which is why

36:34.192 --> 36:35.324
they walked out there.

36:38.128 --> 36:40.862
With the clarity of one
recently risen from the dead,

36:40.864 --> 36:42.196
you're being a grade "A" tool.

36:42.198 --> 36:43.897
You have a bruised ego
from getting

36:43.899 --> 36:46.065
drugged by a bimbo,
and you're being reckless.

36:46.067 --> 36:47.966
This has nothing to do
with me or my ego.

36:47.968 --> 36:49.467
Am I embarrassed? Yes.

36:49.469 --> 36:51.469
Am I desperate to find out
who's responsible for this?

36:51.471 --> 36:53.187
Definitely.

36:53.188 --> 36:54.904
I might offer a deeper
psychological basis,

36:54.907 --> 36:57.374
i.e., your fraught relationship
with Elia.

36:57.376 --> 36:59.075
I should probably get back
to running the checks.

36:59.077 --> 37:01.710
You worked yourself to near
exhaustion the past few weeks

37:01.712 --> 37:02.977
on this project just to prove

37:02.979 --> 37:05.112
to your mentor,
the superstar billionaire,

37:05.114 --> 37:06.480
that you're just like him,

37:06.482 --> 37:08.081
a natural protégé.

37:08.083 --> 37:09.415
What's wrong with that?

37:09.417 --> 37:11.950
Well, the big guy didn't
get his name on a building

37:11.952 --> 37:13.952
by killing his teammates.

37:13.954 --> 37:15.853
One thing to overcompensate
for yourself,

37:15.855 --> 37:17.788
you almost killed me in there.

37:17.790 --> 37:18.922
I calculated
a very high probability

37:18.924 --> 37:20.223
of reviving
you in there.

37:20.225 --> 37:21.224
Oh, how comforting.

37:21.226 --> 37:22.491
The choice I made worked.

37:22.493 --> 37:24.326
By the skin of your teeth,
Walter.

37:24.328 --> 37:26.094
Really, my teeth.

37:27.363 --> 37:29.196
Fine. You know what?

37:29.198 --> 37:30.964
From now on, no undue risk.

37:30.966 --> 37:32.265
How's that sound?

37:32.267 --> 37:34.066
It's easy to say
at the finish line.

37:35.869 --> 37:38.035
You're trying to undo
the events at the bar,

37:38.037 --> 37:40.937
and acting like a madman's
not gonna make that happen.

37:40.939 --> 37:43.439
Nothing is gonna
make that happen.

37:43.441 --> 37:45.274
You see my point?

37:45.276 --> 37:47.276
No.

37:47.278 --> 37:49.011
You can't un-ring a bell,
Walter.

37:50.981 --> 37:52.847
Walt, we got a problem.

37:54.917 --> 37:56.850
What's happening?

37:56.852 --> 37:58.918
Looks like the worm
is reinfecting the system.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.286
ADLER:
What the hell is this?!

38:00.288 --> 38:02.154
(alarm beeping)
WALTER: No, no, no, no, no.

38:02.156 --> 38:03.021
Should not be happening.

38:03.023 --> 38:04.088
Sylvester,

38:04.090 --> 38:06.023
are you out of the game room?

38:07.960 --> 38:11.261
The doors are still locked,
and there's smoke again.

38:11.263 --> 38:12.795
Why is this happening, Walter?

38:12.797 --> 38:15.030
After the reboot,
somehow the worm reinstalled.

38:15.032 --> 38:16.331
But originally
it came from your computer.

38:16.333 --> 38:17.999
You didn't use your laptop
on the reboot.

38:18.001 --> 38:18.933
Reinstalled externally.

38:18.935 --> 38:20.118
HAPPY:
From what?

38:20.119 --> 38:21.302
A device
somewhere in the building?

38:21.304 --> 38:22.536
Or just close by.

38:22.538 --> 38:24.371
It would have to be a device
in communication

38:24.373 --> 38:25.839
with the building's system.

38:25.841 --> 38:27.273
It's keeping the worm
continually active.

38:27.275 --> 38:30.042
It's like those birthday candles
you can't blow out.

38:30.044 --> 38:31.843
Nobody likes those.

38:31.845 --> 38:33.277
If I just knew
the simplest elements

38:33.279 --> 38:35.279
of the worm's original design,
then I could disable it,

38:35.281 --> 38:37.547
but without knowing that,
it will take hours.

38:37.549 --> 38:39.081
SYLVESTER:
Walter, we don't have hours.

38:39.083 --> 38:40.816
The smoke is getting worse.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.217
We need to know who did this.

38:44.054 --> 38:45.153
Thanks for the update.

38:45.155 --> 38:47.221
There's no
suspicious activity

38:47.223 --> 38:49.123
on Stella's cell phone.

38:49.124 --> 38:51.024
She calls her mom every day,
she has an ex in Chicago,

38:51.026 --> 38:53.559
but no communication with anyone
in Richard Elia's company.

38:53.561 --> 38:54.993
They e-mailed
Stella's records.

38:54.995 --> 38:56.494
Boring Web activity.

38:56.496 --> 38:57.962
Tabloid sites, shopping sites,

38:57.964 --> 38:59.930
social media.

38:59.932 --> 39:01.932
Wait, there's a dating site--
Sweet Companionship.

39:01.934 --> 39:03.266
That's women
looking for sugar daddies

39:03.268 --> 39:05.118
or rich guys
looking for hookers.

39:05.119 --> 39:06.969
I know about it because
they spam single women like me

39:06.971 --> 39:07.970
ten times a week.

39:07.972 --> 39:09.204
Did I say anything?

39:09.206 --> 39:11.372
What if this woman was hired
to drug Walter?

39:11.374 --> 39:15.909
Okay, she last visited the site
yesterday at 6:14 p.m.

39:15.911 --> 39:17.877
That's 20 minutes before
Walter went into the bar.

39:17.879 --> 39:19.979
We need to find out who
she's been communicating with

39:19.981 --> 39:21.113
on that Web site.

39:21.115 --> 39:22.948
WALTER:
Structural integrity

39:22.950 --> 39:23.982
of the game room
has been compromised.

39:23.984 --> 39:25.917
SYLVESTER:
This is not news to us!

39:25.919 --> 39:28.152
The fire below has eaten a hole
through the floor!

39:28.154 --> 39:30.988
Sylvester, stay away from
the center of the room.

39:30.990 --> 39:32.923
Way ahead of you!

39:32.925 --> 39:34.991
Walter, through this
whole catastrophe,

39:34.993 --> 39:38.427
I have tried to remain calm
and be the adult in here.

39:38.429 --> 39:41.563
And doing amazing at it, Sly.

39:41.565 --> 39:43.965
But the gaping maw in the center
of the room looks like

39:43.967 --> 39:45.499
a portal to hell!

39:46.301 --> 39:49.035
(all screaming)

39:49.037 --> 39:51.103
You need to get us
out of here now, Walter!

39:57.510 --> 39:59.343
Fire chopper has just arrived,
if you can

39:59.345 --> 40:01.411
get to the roof.
There's no way to the roof.

40:01.413 --> 40:03.413
All access doors are sealed
tight or engulfed in flames.

40:03.415 --> 40:04.447
SYLVESTER:
Hate to concur,

40:04.449 --> 40:06.415
but there's no way out of here.

40:06.417 --> 40:07.433
Except through the windows.

40:07.434 --> 40:08.450
No, it's double-paned,
shatterproof.

40:08.452 --> 40:10.418
And then after that,

40:10.420 --> 40:14.388
it is a plunge down 170 feet
to the concrete.

40:14.390 --> 40:15.422
(building groaning)

40:15.424 --> 40:16.489
Oh.

40:18.392 --> 40:20.291
Heat from the fire is bending
the building supports.

40:20.293 --> 40:22.026
That might be a good thing.

40:22.028 --> 40:23.260
Sylvester, check the integrity

40:23.262 --> 40:25.195
of the windowpane.

40:27.265 --> 40:28.864
The shift
in the building exposed

40:28.866 --> 40:30.115
the corner of the glass.

40:30.116 --> 40:31.365
The space between
the double-paned windows

40:31.368 --> 40:32.467
is filled with gas, yes?

40:32.469 --> 40:33.918
To cool the building
in sunlight.

40:33.919 --> 40:35.368
Great. We just need
to make it explode.

40:35.371 --> 40:38.138
Sylvester, get a flame
to the corner of the window,

40:38.140 --> 40:40.473
heat the gas; the gas will the
expand and crack the window.

40:40.475 --> 40:42.374
Where am I supposed
to get flame?

40:42.376 --> 40:44.609
You know what? Scratch that.
Got it covered.

40:44.611 --> 40:47.078
Can you go break that lamp
and bring me a leg?

40:47.080 --> 40:48.479
Come on, guys.

40:48.481 --> 40:51.181
Okay, so even if we manage
to crack the window,

40:51.183 --> 40:52.916
you're still failing to address
the 170-foot drop.

40:52.918 --> 40:54.417
Fire department helicopter

40:54.419 --> 40:56.185
will drop a
rope ladder,

40:56.187 --> 40:57.319
and you'll climb up.

40:57.321 --> 40:58.486
That sounds harrowing.

41:01.491 --> 41:03.556
Thank you.

41:06.661 --> 41:09.561
(coughs)

41:09.563 --> 41:11.596
Okay.

41:13.166 --> 41:16.167
Uh... okay.

41:16.169 --> 41:18.502
Guys, guys,
shield your eyes.

41:18.504 --> 41:20.170
Okay, go, hide, hide!

41:31.950 --> 41:35.151
(helicopter whirring)

41:35.153 --> 41:37.186
It's open!
Tell the fire department

41:37.188 --> 41:38.654
helicopter to drop
a rope ladder right now!

41:38.656 --> 41:40.288
Dan, do you have that?

41:40.290 --> 41:40.688
Got it.

41:40.690 --> 41:42.523
(panting)

41:42.525 --> 41:44.324
(Sylvester shudders)

41:44.326 --> 41:46.159
Between out there and in here,

41:46.161 --> 41:48.961
I don't know which one
is more terrifying!

41:48.963 --> 41:51.430
(phone rings)

41:51.432 --> 41:52.697
Cabe.

41:52.699 --> 41:54.365
All right, we're
at the headquarters

41:54.367 --> 41:56.166
of Sweet Companionship
Web site.

41:56.168 --> 41:57.768
We called,
and they're still open.

41:57.769 --> 41:59.369
Walk us through it.
Well, if we're gonna find out

41:59.371 --> 42:00.570
who hired this Stella
to drug Walter,

42:00.572 --> 42:01.938
we're gonna have to access

42:01.940 --> 42:02.972
their secure client files.

42:02.974 --> 42:04.506
That means divide and conquer.

42:04.508 --> 42:06.474
Cabe, you're a rich guy
interested in their services.

42:06.476 --> 42:07.925
Paige, you're his assistant.

42:07.926 --> 42:09.375
You're gonna get
the receptionist or secretary,

42:09.378 --> 42:11.144
whoever, away from the computer

42:11.146 --> 42:12.345
while Cabe answers
intake questions.

42:12.347 --> 42:13.813
How do I get the password?

42:13.814 --> 42:15.280
When you're at the computer,
I'll walk you through it.

42:15.283 --> 42:17.016
Oh, and you got
about five minutes to do this

42:17.018 --> 42:19.451
because we're all on the brink
of death. No pressure.

42:19.453 --> 42:21.519
The fire department says
they can't send a man

42:21.521 --> 42:22.770
down the rope ladder.

42:22.771 --> 42:24.020
The heat from the fires
has created too much wind.

42:24.023 --> 42:25.522
It's convection current.

42:32.129 --> 42:34.195
Mr. Dodd!

42:37.300 --> 42:38.565
Good to know!

42:38.567 --> 42:40.567
The smoke from the fires
is getting bad.

42:40.569 --> 42:42.201
The fire department chopper
says they have

42:42.203 --> 42:44.320
about a minute
before they have to bug out.

42:44.321 --> 42:46.438
The ladder needs an anchor
to get it near the building.

42:48.475 --> 42:49.640
It reaches well below
Sylvester's floor.

42:49.642 --> 42:50.741
I can get to it.

42:50.743 --> 42:52.342
I have an idea!

42:52.344 --> 42:53.676
I really hate the sound of this.

43:00.050 --> 43:02.383
(muttering):
What would Toby do?

43:10.525 --> 43:12.458
Oh, your boss shouldn't be
more than a few minutes.

43:12.460 --> 43:14.126
Oh, no, he can take his time.

43:14.128 --> 43:16.561
You know I saw a car
in the parking lot, windows up.

43:16.563 --> 43:18.062
There was a dog inside.

43:18.064 --> 43:19.463
Might be a little
late in the day,

43:19.465 --> 43:21.064
but it's pretty warm out.

43:21.066 --> 43:22.732
What kind of car?

43:22.734 --> 43:25.301
Um, late model Celica.

43:25.303 --> 43:27.453
It's dirt brown.

43:27.454 --> 43:29.604
Some people should not
be allowed to own dogs.

43:29.607 --> 43:31.707
I know, right?

43:36.513 --> 43:38.179
Come on, Toby.

43:38.181 --> 43:40.614
(phone ringing)

43:40.616 --> 43:42.382
(sighs)

43:46.020 --> 43:47.686
Okay.

43:49.056 --> 43:51.322
Check those windows. Okay.

43:58.230 --> 44:01.464
Here. Happy, lighter!

44:02.500 --> 44:03.665
Hey, get down!

44:03.667 --> 44:06.300
Eyes!

44:16.578 --> 44:18.477
Sylvester!

44:18.479 --> 44:20.545
Sly! Hey!

44:20.547 --> 44:21.746
I have a plan!

44:21.748 --> 44:23.114
Get the kids ready

44:23.116 --> 44:24.682
to climb onto the ladder!

44:24.684 --> 44:26.483
Okay.

44:29.120 --> 44:30.185
So you mentioned a plan.

44:30.187 --> 44:31.252
I'm not seeing a good one.

44:31.254 --> 44:33.621
Ladder just needs an anchor.

44:33.623 --> 44:35.439
Uh, I'm not liking
your sprinter stance.

44:35.440 --> 44:37.256
I know I promised not
to do anything irrational

44:37.259 --> 44:39.292
anymore, but, uh,
one more time.

44:39.294 --> 44:43.329
(screams, groans)

44:43.331 --> 44:44.830
(screaming)

44:45.666 --> 44:46.798
He's out of his mind.

44:46.800 --> 44:48.699
Okay, grab him and
anchor the ladder.

44:50.703 --> 44:52.803
That was the stupidest thing
I've ever seen--

44:52.805 --> 44:54.171
but effective.

44:54.173 --> 44:55.272
(groans)

44:55.274 --> 44:57.274
I got it! Got the ladder!

44:57.276 --> 44:58.375
Come on, kids, come on.

44:58.377 --> 44:59.809
Quickly, come on.

44:59.811 --> 45:01.143
Guys,

45:01.145 --> 45:02.677
it's just like the jungle gym.

45:02.679 --> 45:04.612
Okay?

45:04.614 --> 45:06.513
FIREMAN:
Send the kids up now!

45:06.515 --> 45:08.681
Come on.

45:08.683 --> 45:09.548
Come on, first one out,
let's go.

45:09.550 --> 45:10.715
Little ones first.

45:11.584 --> 45:12.782
Lola, come on.

45:15.753 --> 45:17.385
Good job.

45:17.387 --> 45:18.452
One hand over the other.

45:18.454 --> 45:19.553
That's right.

45:19.554 --> 45:20.653
Keep going, keep going,
you're good.

45:20.656 --> 45:22.322
Okay, buddy.

45:29.630 --> 45:31.630
In an incredible act of heroism,

45:31.632 --> 45:33.331
an unidentified person

45:33.333 --> 45:35.199
leapt from the building
to secure a rescue ladder...

45:35.201 --> 45:36.366
Walter did it!

45:36.368 --> 45:37.567
The kids are gonna be okay.

45:37.569 --> 45:40.636
(phone buzzes)

45:40.638 --> 45:42.371
Richard.

45:42.373 --> 45:43.705
Walter's not a savior.

45:43.707 --> 45:45.773
He's the problem.

45:52.214 --> 45:53.513
Chester?

45:54.249 --> 45:56.182
No. (sighs)

45:56.184 --> 45:58.651
Cute Chester?

45:58.653 --> 46:00.285
No.

46:00.287 --> 46:01.719
Sweet Chester?

46:09.194 --> 46:11.661
Baby Chester?

46:11.663 --> 46:12.862
Oh, my God,

46:12.864 --> 46:14.530
I'm in.

46:14.532 --> 46:16.698
Okay. Stella.

46:28.344 --> 46:30.344
All right, keep going!

46:30.345 --> 46:32.345
Remember to look up and
head towards the firefighters.

46:32.348 --> 46:33.580
Look up, keep going.

46:33.582 --> 46:35.815
Give me your hand.

46:35.817 --> 46:38.250
We're running out of time.

46:38.252 --> 46:39.251
You're all right.

46:39.253 --> 46:40.385
There's too much turbulence.

46:40.387 --> 46:41.686
Two's in, number
two is secure.

46:41.688 --> 46:42.920
How's your visibility?

46:42.922 --> 46:44.788
Your turn, Russell.

46:44.790 --> 46:46.689
Can you still see?

46:46.691 --> 46:48.257
My comics!

46:48.259 --> 46:50.525
Okay, Russell, you need

46:50.527 --> 46:52.727
to go, now!

46:54.831 --> 46:56.664
(softly):
Okay.

46:56.666 --> 46:59.700
Okay, buddy.

47:07.709 --> 47:08.641
The smoke's too heavy!

47:08.643 --> 47:09.842
We got to go now!

47:11.412 --> 47:12.811
(over speaker):
We have to pull out!

47:12.813 --> 47:13.878
The smoke's too heavy.

47:15.615 --> 47:17.681
We'll be back as soon as we can.

47:30.361 --> 47:32.761
Sly! Hey, stay calm!

47:32.763 --> 47:34.329
We're gonna get you down, okay?

47:34.331 --> 47:35.830
We can't get him down.

47:35.832 --> 47:37.832
And we can't wait
for another chopper.

47:37.834 --> 47:39.600
He's got minutes before the
floor collapses into the fire.

47:39.602 --> 47:40.801
TOBY: That's a 170-foot drop

47:40.803 --> 47:42.202
from the window.

47:42.204 --> 47:43.536
Even Super Fun Guy
wouldn't make it.

47:43.538 --> 47:44.870
There has to be a third way.

47:46.773 --> 47:48.806
What if we could use
the building's smart tech

47:48.808 --> 47:49.773
to our advantage?

47:49.775 --> 47:50.940
That would be
a first for today.

47:50.942 --> 47:52.374
Can you rig an emergency light

47:52.376 --> 47:53.842
to amplify its output?

47:53.843 --> 47:55.309
To where it feels like
you're looking at the sun.

47:55.312 --> 47:56.711
Good, 'cause we're gonna need
a huge amount of light

47:56.713 --> 47:58.446
to extend the building's
retractable solar panels.

47:58.448 --> 48:01.315
Create a solar panel staircase
for Sly to climb down.

48:01.317 --> 48:02.749
Oh, that's brilliant!

48:02.751 --> 48:04.784
I mean, that might work.

48:06.687 --> 48:08.486
Homeland is running
the name and number

48:08.488 --> 48:09.854
of Stella's last hookup.

48:09.856 --> 48:11.522
Should be just
a few minutes.

48:11.524 --> 48:13.524
How many years
have you known Walter?

48:14.460 --> 48:16.793
20 years, give or take.

48:16.795 --> 48:18.211
Have you ever seen him act

48:18.212 --> 48:19.628
like the guy
in the surveillance footage?

48:19.631 --> 48:20.730
Jovial, laughing,

48:20.732 --> 48:22.264
joking...

48:22.266 --> 48:23.298
No.

48:23.300 --> 48:24.632
Yeah.

48:24.634 --> 48:27.534
Just makes me wonder
if there's another aspect

48:27.536 --> 48:28.735
to his personality.

48:28.737 --> 48:31.871
An aspect he doesn't let me--
us see.

48:31.873 --> 48:35.908
We all make choices
about letting people in.

48:35.910 --> 48:38.477
Is that what Walter's doing?

48:38.479 --> 48:41.680
(phone ringing)

48:41.682 --> 48:43.748
Gallo.

48:49.021 --> 48:50.754
Great. Thanks so much.

48:50.756 --> 48:53.289
The names are fake, no surprise.

48:53.291 --> 48:54.657
The cell is a burner.

48:54.659 --> 48:55.791
Oh, so we're back to square one?

48:55.793 --> 48:57.325
Not quite.

48:57.327 --> 48:58.793
They triangulated the number

48:58.795 --> 49:00.694
back to Elia's Research
and Development campus

49:00.696 --> 49:02.563
in Santa Monica.

49:02.564 --> 49:04.431
It was an inside job.
Someone in the company.

49:04.433 --> 49:05.565
(engine starts)
At this hour,

49:05.567 --> 49:07.700
we should make it in no time.

49:07.702 --> 49:08.834
TOBY:
I can get it.

49:08.836 --> 49:10.268
If it would just come loose.

49:11.838 --> 49:13.637
Okay, I know how to do this.

49:13.639 --> 49:14.738
See? I don't need your help.

49:15.407 --> 49:16.639
(groans)

49:16.641 --> 49:18.440
God! You just punched me!

49:18.442 --> 49:20.742
You realize ten minutes ago
I was technically deceased!

49:20.744 --> 49:22.410
Yeah, I should have
left you that way.

49:22.412 --> 49:24.678
You're acting like a child,
and I am sick of it.

49:24.680 --> 49:27.814
I was trying to prove my ability
to be independent from you.

49:27.816 --> 49:28.881
Yeah, you made it
pretty obvious.

49:28.883 --> 49:30.515
Now help, or get out of the way.

49:30.517 --> 49:32.049
But if you assert
your independence again,

49:32.051 --> 49:33.950
the next time you die
it'll be for real.

49:46.930 --> 49:48.763
The sensors are on
the edge of the panel.

49:48.765 --> 49:50.297
Once they get hit by the light,

49:50.299 --> 49:52.365
they should extend.

49:57.704 --> 49:59.637
You can use them
like a staircase

49:59.639 --> 50:00.738
to get down to us.

50:00.740 --> 50:01.905
You got it?
But step quick.

50:01.907 --> 50:03.706
I can only extend
one at a time.

50:03.708 --> 50:05.074
Ah, come on.

50:05.076 --> 50:07.543
SYLVESTER:
This might be a sign

50:07.545 --> 50:09.444
that this plan
is highly dangerous

50:09.446 --> 50:10.945
and frankly, a little rash!

50:17.319 --> 50:20.787
Oh, that panel looks
very flimsy.

50:20.789 --> 50:21.888
I'm gonna run the calculation

50:21.890 --> 50:23.956
on the chances
it can even hold me.

50:23.958 --> 50:25.524
No, no, no.
Don't run the calculations!

50:25.526 --> 50:27.025
Just trust us
that we can get you down.

50:27.027 --> 50:28.726
WALTER:
Look at me.

50:28.728 --> 50:29.760
You can do this.

50:29.762 --> 50:30.994
Okay?

50:38.403 --> 50:39.768
(sighs)

50:42.606 --> 50:43.638
(whimpers)

50:45.842 --> 50:47.408
(whimpers)

50:47.410 --> 50:49.776
Just don't look down.

50:52.914 --> 50:54.847
(screams) I looked down!
It was the first thing I did!

51:06.727 --> 51:08.727
(screaming)

51:08.729 --> 51:10.662
Happy,

51:10.664 --> 51:12.614
my panel is disappearing!

51:12.615 --> 51:14.565
HAPPY: Because the light is
extending the next one.

51:14.567 --> 51:16.567
Step down!

51:16.569 --> 51:17.868
WALTER:
Sylvester, just step down.

51:17.870 --> 51:18.969
Do it now!

51:18.971 --> 51:20.103
(screams)

51:21.573 --> 51:22.872
Hang on, hang on, hang on.

51:22.874 --> 51:24.773
TOBY: Just a few more,

51:24.775 --> 51:26.775
and you'll be in
our loving arms.

51:26.777 --> 51:28.877
(cracking)

51:30.814 --> 51:33.881
My calculations
would have predicted this!

51:36.418 --> 51:37.950
This one's gonna catch you, Sly.

51:37.952 --> 51:39.384
SYLVESTER:
I don't want to be caught!

51:39.386 --> 51:40.885
I don't want to fall at all!

51:40.887 --> 51:41.952
Sly, hang on!

51:51.930 --> 51:53.162
The power source.

51:53.164 --> 51:54.930
What the hell
happened to the juice?

51:54.932 --> 51:58.066
Guys, a little help up here!

51:58.068 --> 51:59.834
Power in this room
is still on.

51:59.836 --> 52:02.169
Must be an issue with a specific
blade in the server room.

52:02.171 --> 52:03.537
Hold on. I got an idea.

52:03.539 --> 52:04.971
Just hold tight, Sly.

52:04.973 --> 52:07.006
(whimpering):
Oh, no.

52:08.075 --> 52:10.175
Hey! Sylvester's about to fall
off the side of the building!

52:10.177 --> 52:11.509
What the hell
are you doing?

52:11.511 --> 52:12.910
What we should have done
hours ago.

52:12.912 --> 52:14.445
Taken back control
of the building.

52:14.446 --> 52:15.979
We're gonna get Dan up to
speed on this program,

52:15.981 --> 52:17.136
and see if he can
clean this up.

52:17.137 --> 52:18.292
Dan doesn't know how
to run this system.

52:18.293 --> 52:19.448
It would take him
two hours, at least,

52:19.451 --> 52:21.484
just to get familiar
with this interface.

52:21.486 --> 52:23.185
You need to re-engage
that power source now.

52:23.187 --> 52:25.654
It is the only thing
that can save Sylvester

52:25.656 --> 52:27.188
from plummeting
to his death.

52:27.190 --> 52:28.923
Walter, I have been giving you
the benefit of the doubt all day

52:28.925 --> 52:29.957
but I have to stop
listening to you.

52:29.959 --> 52:31.591
We received an e-mail
about you.

52:31.593 --> 52:33.893
An e-mail? You ever heard
of counterfeiting malware?

52:33.895 --> 52:36.428
Yeah, it's a security
measure the coders use

52:36.430 --> 52:37.796
to deter the theft of
proprietary software.

52:37.798 --> 52:38.997
And what has this got
to do with anything?

52:38.999 --> 52:40.898
You ran out of time,
so ripped off elements

52:40.900 --> 52:42.766
of the smart building system
from a third party.

52:42.768 --> 52:43.900
That had hidden malware.

52:43.901 --> 52:45.033
And now we are dealing
with the consequences!

52:45.036 --> 52:45.934
That is un--

52:45.936 --> 52:47.535
That is untrue.

52:47.537 --> 52:49.637
Now, whoever sent that e-mail
is the responsible party,

52:49.639 --> 52:52.473
and is trying to set me up
for something that they did.

52:52.475 --> 52:53.474
I don't think you meant
to hurt anybody,

52:53.476 --> 52:54.475
but you overreached.

52:54.477 --> 52:55.976
Okay, then,
where's the e-mail?

52:55.978 --> 52:56.943
Show it to me.
Come on!

52:56.945 --> 52:57.966
I think it's very possible

52:57.967 --> 52:58.988
that you wanted this
too much, Walter.

52:58.989 --> 53:00.010
You wanted to impress me
too much,

53:00.014 --> 53:01.397
and this is the result.

53:01.398 --> 53:02.781
You need to get the server
blades back in,

53:02.783 --> 53:03.815
so we can save Sylvester.

53:03.817 --> 53:04.916
Leave this room now.

53:04.918 --> 53:06.584
You no longer
have any contact

53:06.586 --> 53:07.751
with any of
the building controls.

53:07.753 --> 53:09.152
Got it?
I'm sorry, Walter.

53:20.230 --> 53:22.663
Hey, hey, hey...

53:22.665 --> 53:24.831
I need to save my friend's life.

53:28.503 --> 53:30.569
Guys...
I'm not sure how long

53:30.571 --> 53:31.503
I can hang on up here!

53:31.505 --> 53:32.971
I thought positivity

53:32.973 --> 53:34.105
was your middle name!

53:34.107 --> 53:35.106
HAPPY: Walt's gonna have

53:35.108 --> 53:37.007
the power back on any second.

53:37.009 --> 53:38.942
I met the woman of my dreams...

53:38.944 --> 53:41.077
and I just received
my Super-dor.

53:41.079 --> 53:42.144
I am not ready to go!

53:47.551 --> 53:49.651
You know, I did everything
that I could to save your son.

53:49.653 --> 53:52.086
But more importantly,
the man about to fall

53:52.088 --> 53:53.787
from that building,
Sylvester Dodd,

53:53.789 --> 53:56.156
risked his own life,
so he could save him, too.

53:56.158 --> 53:58.925
I am not returning control
of this building to you.

53:58.927 --> 54:02.128
You are at worst a liar,
and at best incompetent!

54:02.130 --> 54:03.696
The accusatory e-mail...

54:03.698 --> 54:05.698
just consider what
you know of me today,

54:05.700 --> 54:07.066
and what you know
about that sender.

54:09.904 --> 54:11.904
You don't know the sender.
It was anonymous.

54:11.906 --> 54:14.840
The guy's a gutless coward.

54:14.842 --> 54:16.174
Versus Sylvester?

54:16.176 --> 54:19.744
A paranoid, neurotic
compulsive who put aside

54:19.746 --> 54:22.213
all of his anxieties, just so
he could save those kids.

54:22.215 --> 54:24.682
Now, please,
hang me if you want.

54:24.684 --> 54:25.949
But let him live.

54:31.589 --> 54:33.522
I can't just let him fall!

54:33.524 --> 54:34.589
I am thinking!

54:36.759 --> 54:38.992
Ah! The power's back on!

54:39.894 --> 54:40.959
Sly, hold on!

54:42.262 --> 54:44.195
What are you doing?!

54:44.196 --> 54:46.129
Not that panel!
The one directly beneath me!

54:46.132 --> 54:47.731
Trust me!

54:47.733 --> 54:48.932
(squeaking)

54:48.934 --> 54:50.700
(shuddering):
Oh, no...

54:51.736 --> 54:52.668
Oh!

54:53.871 --> 54:55.169
(Sylvester shouts)

54:58.641 --> 55:00.641
(gasps, then laughs)

55:00.643 --> 55:01.875
I made it!

55:01.877 --> 55:03.009
(gasping)

55:03.011 --> 55:04.543
I can't believe it!

55:05.612 --> 55:07.845
Oh, whew!
Oh, I'm in pain.

55:07.847 --> 55:09.613
But I'm alive!

55:11.683 --> 55:13.849
That burner phone's in here somewhere.
Keep calling it.

55:13.851 --> 55:15.183
So many people have left
the building for the day.

55:15.185 --> 55:16.651
What if one of them
has the phone?

55:16.653 --> 55:17.652
Then we're screwed.

55:17.654 --> 55:18.853
(phone ringing)

55:20.790 --> 55:22.956
CABE: The guy who hired
Stella is a fancy executive.

55:22.958 --> 55:25.792
Excuse me. Hey! Can-can I
help you with something?

55:25.794 --> 55:27.593
(phone ringing)
Homeland.

55:27.595 --> 55:28.760
We need a key
for that office now.

55:28.762 --> 55:30.194
We don't use keys here.

55:30.196 --> 55:31.828
Well, how the hell
do you unlock the doors?

55:31.830 --> 55:33.229
Implant technology.
That's what we develop here.

55:33.231 --> 55:34.897
(phone continues ringing)

55:39.570 --> 55:40.735
FEMALE ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Thank you.

55:42.872 --> 55:45.172
(ringing continues)

55:45.174 --> 55:47.340
PAIGE: Oh! There.

55:47.342 --> 55:48.974
Our burner.

55:48.976 --> 55:50.307
Look familiar?

55:53.812 --> 55:55.578
Oh! Oh! You made it!

55:55.580 --> 55:57.580
A bit of a rough
landing, but...

55:57.582 --> 55:59.848
I owe you my life,
my riches, my firstborn!

55:59.850 --> 56:02.016
Your comics?
Not that.

56:02.018 --> 56:03.784
(phone ringing)
Okay...

56:04.620 --> 56:05.685
It's Paige.

56:05.687 --> 56:07.420
Hey.
CABE: Walter!

56:07.421 --> 56:09.154
We found the man who hired
the escort to drug you!

56:09.157 --> 56:10.990
It's Dan Smaisle.

56:10.992 --> 56:12.257
Elia's Head of Biometrics.

56:12.259 --> 56:13.791
He specializes
in implant technology.

56:13.793 --> 56:15.225
He must have the
transmitter chip

56:15.227 --> 56:18.795
that uploads the worm
implanted into this arm.

56:18.797 --> 56:20.246
Since he's running point,
right outside,

56:20.247 --> 56:21.696
he's close enough
that the virus reloads

56:21.699 --> 56:22.998
every time
we re-boot the system.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.000
But why would he do this?

56:25.002 --> 56:26.301
You know the guy
before tonight?

56:26.303 --> 56:27.802
No. Cabe...

56:27.804 --> 56:29.336
you have to find Smaisle
and kill that chip.

56:29.338 --> 56:31.304
HAPPY: It's the only chance
we have to get the doors open.

56:31.306 --> 56:32.938
Hang tight.

56:32.940 --> 56:34.973
Hang tight.

56:34.975 --> 56:36.941
Okay, once we get
the call from Cabe,

56:36.943 --> 56:39.843
I'm going to be able to
manually open the lobby doors.

56:39.845 --> 56:41.211
Everything's gonna be fine...
You son of a bitch!

56:41.213 --> 56:42.145
You son of a bitch! Hey!
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

56:42.147 --> 56:43.146
Listen to me.

56:43.148 --> 56:44.881
Listen to me! Elia!

56:44.883 --> 56:46.983
It was Smaisle.
It was Smaisle.

56:46.985 --> 56:48.084
He hired that escort
to drug me,

56:48.086 --> 56:49.952
so he could plant that virus.

56:49.954 --> 56:51.119
TOBY:
I don't see any of

56:51.121 --> 56:52.920
Dan's biometrics
in this building.

56:52.922 --> 56:53.954
Now, were those
in the budget

56:53.956 --> 56:56.122
before old Walter
came along?

56:56.124 --> 56:57.022
Well, he tripled the
tech budget three weeks ago.

56:57.024 --> 56:58.890
I slashed Dan's funding.

56:58.892 --> 57:00.658
So he tried to ruin your
launch, to get back at you.

57:00.660 --> 57:02.760
(gasping)

57:14.974 --> 57:16.940
Split up.
We're gonna search the crowd.

57:16.942 --> 57:18.775
Okay.

57:34.258 --> 57:35.924
(speaking quietly)

57:35.926 --> 57:37.759
Freeze!

57:47.970 --> 57:49.736
(tires screech)
(grunts)

57:51.940 --> 57:53.239
Don't move!
CABE: Out of the way!

57:53.241 --> 57:55.741
I didn't mean for it
to get this far.

57:55.743 --> 57:57.142
I just wanted
to prove a point.

57:57.144 --> 57:59.210
Walter said the chip
would be in his arm.

57:59.212 --> 58:01.045
I stayed nearby, didn't I?

58:01.047 --> 58:01.979
I tried to help.

58:01.981 --> 58:03.113
Yeah, you staying nearby

58:03.115 --> 58:04.380
is what kept
the damn thing rebooting.

58:04.382 --> 58:06.415
All it was supposed to do
is lock the doors

58:06.417 --> 58:07.949
and race the A/C for an hour.

58:07.951 --> 58:09.951
Scare people, then disappear.

58:09.953 --> 58:10.952
Hey, how do we kill the implant

58:10.953 --> 58:11.952
so it won't reinstall the worm?

58:11.955 --> 58:13.788
Smash it or shock it.

58:15.825 --> 58:18.959
Stun gun. He just came out of
nowhere and took all my funding.

58:18.961 --> 58:20.193
I swear I'm not a bad person.

58:20.195 --> 58:21.460
I didn't want
anyone to get hurt.

58:21.462 --> 58:23.028
Neither do we.

58:23.030 --> 58:24.295
(groaning)

58:26.165 --> 58:26.997
We fried the chip.

58:26.999 --> 58:28.164
If the worm is dead,

58:28.166 --> 58:29.615
then I should be able

58:29.616 --> 58:31.065
to reinstate
emergency systems...

58:31.068 --> 58:33.001
now!

58:36.973 --> 58:38.772
OFFICER:
This way, people.

58:38.774 --> 58:39.839
(people coughing)

58:40.741 --> 58:42.073
OFFICER:
Take your time.

58:47.013 --> 58:48.145
Okay, great.

58:52.483 --> 58:54.216
Can we please leave now?

59:14.504 --> 59:17.004
Smaisle sent
the anonymous e-mail.

59:19.108 --> 59:21.475
Sorry I doubted you.
Eh.

59:21.477 --> 59:24.311
I'm sorry I hit you over
the head with a laptop.

59:25.814 --> 59:27.947
You know...

59:27.949 --> 59:29.181
for what it's worth,

59:29.183 --> 59:31.850
I think it's admirable
that you tried.

59:31.852 --> 59:33.284
The next one will work.

59:33.286 --> 59:35.352
The next one?

59:35.354 --> 59:37.153
Are you gonna
do this again?

59:37.155 --> 59:39.487
This failed.

59:42.758 --> 59:46.126
Walter, people think I'm some
kind of brilliant visionary.

59:46.128 --> 59:47.894
The reason I'm successful

59:47.896 --> 59:49.395
is because,
on the heels of defeat,

59:49.397 --> 59:51.063
I start all over again.

59:51.065 --> 59:52.864
Failure is part of
the process.

59:54.367 --> 59:56.066
You don't know where
you're vulnerable...

59:56.068 --> 59:58.334
until you fail.

1:00:05.175 --> 1:00:07.175
(exhaling)

1:00:11.047 --> 1:00:14.181
Cabe just got word--
Stella was arrested.

1:00:14.183 --> 1:00:15.815
She gave it up
in the police car:

1:00:15.817 --> 1:00:17.183
drugging you,
planting the worm.

1:00:19.153 --> 1:00:22.354
I... I have to admit

1:00:22.356 --> 1:00:25.390
uh, that I had
some complicated feelings

1:00:25.392 --> 1:00:27.325
about you...

1:00:27.327 --> 1:00:29.060
hitting on Stella.

1:00:29.062 --> 1:00:31.195
I did not hit on Stella.

1:00:31.197 --> 1:00:34.198
I was practicing to be
more normal around people.

1:00:34.200 --> 1:00:36.300
And then she drugged me.

1:00:36.302 --> 1:00:37.334
Very different thing.

1:00:37.336 --> 1:00:39.102
Well, I-I'm,
I'm proud of you for

1:00:39.104 --> 1:00:41.137
trying to connect with, with
people who aren't like you.

1:00:41.139 --> 1:00:43.439
It probably scared you more
than being in that building.

1:00:43.441 --> 1:00:45.140
But you-you did it, anyway.

1:00:46.309 --> 1:00:50.344
Don't let this one
horrible experience

1:00:50.346 --> 1:00:52.579
stop you from trying
to connect with people.

1:00:52.581 --> 1:00:54.414
There's more inside
of you, you know,

1:00:54.416 --> 1:00:56.182
than you know, Walter.

1:01:01.154 --> 1:01:03.087
You can't unring a bell.

1:01:03.089 --> 1:01:05.222
Something Toby said.

1:01:05.224 --> 1:01:09.226
I think it means, uh, that now
I'm aware of these facts,

1:01:09.228 --> 1:01:11.261
there's no returning
to who I was.

1:01:14.232 --> 1:01:15.598
We'll see about that.

1:01:15.600 --> 1:01:17.099
Yeah.

1:01:17.101 --> 1:01:18.166
Yeah.

1:01:21.504 --> 1:01:25.038
Hey, John McClane,
you need a ride?

1:01:28.076 --> 1:01:29.375
Who's John McClane?

1:01:31.145 --> 1:01:33.011
Some guy in a movie.

1:01:33.013 --> 1:01:34.178
Never mind.

1:01:34.180 --> 1:01:35.412
Let's go.

1:01:45.256 --> 1:01:47.122
...so, you know,
the, uh, buildings

1:01:47.124 --> 1:01:48.456
are about to go
up in flames,

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:51.025
and then we
caught Smaisle.

1:01:51.027 --> 1:01:53.227
The, uh, yeah,
the bad guy.

1:01:53.229 --> 1:01:55.362
And, uh, you know,
made it out alive.

1:01:55.364 --> 1:01:57.964
Dude! That's is just like
that movie!

1:01:57.966 --> 1:01:59.231
Oh, yeah!
With John McCain.

1:01:59.233 --> 1:02:00.398
Mm. Not quite.

1:02:02.969 --> 1:02:04.134
All right, well...

1:02:05.470 --> 1:02:07.436
Yeah! Looks like we're
done for the day.

1:02:07.438 --> 1:02:08.870
Well, you know
what that means.

1:02:08.872 --> 1:02:10.071
Happiest hour
of the day.

1:02:11.074 --> 1:02:12.306
Happy hour.

1:02:12.308 --> 1:02:13.607
At a bar.

1:02:13.609 --> 1:02:17.177
People, food, music--
any of that ringing a bell?

1:02:17.179 --> 1:02:21.014
Great deals... no?
Nothing? Anyhoo...

1:02:21.016 --> 1:02:23.149
I'd invite you, but I know
you'd probably say no, brother,

1:02:23.151 --> 1:02:25.151
so, uh, I'll see you
later, okay?

1:02:25.153 --> 1:02:26.152
Okay.

1:02:26.154 --> 1:02:28.387
Oh! Hey, um... Ray...

1:02:28.389 --> 1:02:30.122
I'll go.

1:02:30.124 --> 1:02:31.189
Yeah?

1:02:31.191 --> 1:02:32.557
Yeah.

1:02:32.559 --> 1:02:34.125
Sweet!

1:02:34.127 --> 1:02:37.294
This time, I am going to
stick to club soda.

1:02:37.296 --> 1:02:39.062
Roger that.
