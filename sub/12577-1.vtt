Ever since the explosion, every song l play
sounds like Feels So Good.

27:21.181 --> 27:23.877
[Marie laughing]

27:26.953 --> 27:28.921
[Leaf blower running]

27:29.322 --> 27:31.483
[Cheerful instrumental music]

27:35.228 --> 27:36.695
[Electric drill whirring]

27:45.672 --> 27:49.699
BOBBY: What are you going to get, Marie?
MARlE: l don't eat anything with a head.

27:51.511 --> 27:53.172
l'm a vegetarian, Bobby.

27:55.015 --> 27:57.449
-l don't eat meat.
-My dad says...

27:57.550 --> 28:01.782
if God didn't want us to eat meat,
He wouldn't have invented steak sauce.

28:01.888 --> 28:03.048
Your dad says that?

28:03.757 --> 28:04.746
Once.

28:04.858 --> 28:08.919
Did you know that the average person
consumes 500 chickens?

28:09.329 --> 28:12.730
That's enough chickens
to feed a whole starving village.

28:12.832 --> 28:14.959
But they shouldn't eat them.

28:15.568 --> 28:17.160
Because that's bad.

28:17.270 --> 28:22.207
-l'll have the chopped salad, please.
-And l'll have the BLT, please.

28:22.642 --> 28:26.271
-That has bacon, Bobby.
-Bacon doesn't have a head on it.

28:28.515 --> 28:30.983
Could you make that an LT, please?

28:32.285 --> 28:35.152
Tonight was fun.
My friends think you're a riot.

28:35.255 --> 28:39.589
l really was choking at the food court,
but don't tell them that.

28:41.461 --> 28:43.486
There's a couch in the alley.

28:43.596 --> 28:44.858
Sit down.

28:46.733 --> 28:49.702
-You want to kiss?
-l'll try anything once.

28:49.803 --> 28:52.704
l didn't think l'd like fruit pies,
but then l tried one...

28:52.806 --> 28:56.037
and if your kiss is anything
like a fruit pie, l'm sure--

28:56.142 --> 28:57.473
[Smooching]

29:01.081 --> 29:03.072
All right. See you around.

29:10.523 --> 29:11.581
[Peggy humming]

29:11.691 --> 29:16.151
Mom, Dad, did you see the sunrise
this morning?

29:16.429 --> 29:19.728
lt was the same color
as my girlfriend Marie's hair.

29:19.833 --> 29:20.891
[Peggy sighs]

29:21.001 --> 29:23.026
Here's your coffee, sweetmeat.

29:23.136 --> 29:24.160
[Bobby sniffing]

29:24.270 --> 29:26.932
Reminds me of my girlfriend Marie.

29:27.040 --> 29:29.508
She likes to drink her coffee black, too.

29:30.110 --> 29:32.908
Looks like they'll finally
cut down the big oak tree...

29:33.013 --> 29:34.776
in the middle of the ball park.

29:35.305 --> 29:41.267
