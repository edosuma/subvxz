of other kids.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.894
we all met at
splash palace...

01:33.927 --> 01:35.329
i don't know.

01:35.363 --> 01:37.798
i'm not sure
if he really likes me.

01:40.168 --> 01:41.202
oh, him. ugh!

01:41.235 --> 01:42.636
he's just so dramatic.

01:42.670 --> 01:44.805
the way he's all over me.

01:44.838 --> 01:46.407
tonight.

01:46.440 --> 01:47.808
i just got to do it.

01:47.841 --> 01:49.843
we got to cut him loose.

01:51.479 --> 01:54.448
yeah. mm-hmm.

01:54.482 --> 01:55.516
(doorbell rings)

01:55.549 --> 01:57.385

01:57.418 --> 01:59.720
ok, later.

02:03.924 --> 02:08.461
oh. didn't i say i'd
meet you at flookie's?

02:08.496 --> 02:12.366
i thought, just as easy,
i'd pick you up.

02:12.400 --> 02:14.435
i was thinking
about you.

02:18.372 --> 02:21.542
oh, my god, billy.
it's beautiful.

02:24.678 --> 02:34.355
* 'cause i'm stormy

02:36.357 --> 02:38.826
* yes, i'm stormy...

02:38.859 --> 02:40.528
hmm. not now.

02:40.561 --> 02:43.797
i can't help myself.
your body's so perfect.

02:43.831 --> 02:46.434
what if somebody
comes in?

02:48.302 --> 02:49.403
let's go up.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.405
it's too hot upstairs.

02:51.439 --> 02:53.374
oh, no, no, no.
just to lay down.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.742
my room's
a disaster.

02:54.775 --> 02:57.278
we're not going
to take everything
off, just snuggle.

02:57.311 --> 02:59.847
no! let's just go
ahead to flookie's

02:59.880 --> 03:01.415
and meet the others.

03:01.449 --> 03:03.784
no, come on.
five minutes.

03:03.817 --> 03:08.356
singer: * with
your blood-soaked lips *

03:08.389 --> 03:11.792
* whet my appetite...

03:11.825 --> 03:14.662
my pictures, my poems.
why'd you take 'em down?

03:14.695 --> 03:16.264
why are they
in a box?

03:16.297 --> 03:17.598
this disgusting
color.

03:17.631 --> 03:18.999
my dad said
he'd repaint

03:19.032 --> 03:20.934
if i cleared
everything.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.509
you know, you're not
a very good liar.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.943
i didn't lie.

03:29.977 --> 03:32.446
get off,
get off!

03:32.480 --> 03:33.647
get out!

03:33.681 --> 03:35.283
wait!

03:36.784 --> 03:38.952
oh, i'm not good enough
for you anymore?

03:38.986 --> 03:40.721
i bet if my name
was kevin shane...

03:40.754 --> 03:43.757
what's kevin shane
got to do with it?

03:43.791 --> 03:47.961
because i don't drive
a four-by like him!

03:47.995 --> 03:49.363
get out!

03:49.397 --> 03:50.531
i'm talking to you.

03:50.564 --> 03:51.699
not in that tone
you don't.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.402
erin, if you
don't love me,

03:54.435 --> 03:56.404
why did you make
love to me?

03:56.437 --> 03:57.805
you're the one

03:57.838 --> 04:00.808
that made it into
this big serious thing.

04:01.775 --> 04:02.843
all lies, right?

04:02.876 --> 04:05.012
i didn't lie.
shut up.

04:05.045 --> 04:07.014
don't tell me
to shut up!

04:07.047 --> 04:09.016
get out, you idiot.
i'm calling the police.

04:09.049 --> 04:10.751
don't you ever
call me an idiot.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.386
i'm calling the police.
no!

04:12.420 --> 04:14.688
stop it! let go!

04:15.989 --> 04:22.363
singer:
* 'cause i'm stormy

04:22.396 --> 04:24.264
* again

04:26.700 --> 04:32.906
* 'cause i'm stormy

04:32.940 --> 04:34.708
* again

04:37.845 --> 04:39.680
* ooh ooh ooh

04:39.713 --> 04:45.419
* you would die for me

04:45.453 --> 04:48.489
* you would die

05:01.835 --> 05:07.508
* you would die for me

05:07.541 --> 05:09.643
* you would die

05:09.677 --> 05:12.913
* ah ah

05:12.946 --> 05:18.686
* you would die for me

05:18.719 --> 05:21.989
* you would die

05:24.425 --> 05:30.431
* you would die for me

05:32.733 --> 05:34.101
man: and every time i
reread "daisy miller,"

05:34.134 --> 05:37.070
i like to recall
how it was poe who said...

05:39.006 --> 05:41.709
that the death
of a beautiful woman

05:41.742 --> 05:45.112
is the most affecting
subject for literary art.

05:49.116 --> 05:51.585
ah, miss lewisohn?

05:53.487 --> 05:54.622
miss lewisohn,
do you think

05:54.655 --> 05:56.123
henry james
was foreshadowing

05:56.156 --> 05:57.525
the modern
feminist movement?

05:57.558 --> 05:58.692
well, he sure isn't

05:58.726 --> 06:00.494
foreshadowing the sexual
revolution.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.962
(laughter)

06:01.995 --> 06:04.031
right, but we're talking
about the 1870s here.

06:04.064 --> 06:06.700
this girl is
practically crucified

06:06.734 --> 06:07.735
for holding hands in public

06:07.768 --> 06:09.603
with a guy who's
not her fiance.

06:09.637 --> 06:11.038
but isn't james
making a statement

06:11.071 --> 06:12.640
about daisy's
independence?

06:12.673 --> 06:15.509
yes. and she pays for it.
he goes and kills her.

06:21.582 --> 06:22.916
very good,
miss lewisohn.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.918
(bell ringing)

06:24.952 --> 06:27.655
ok, ok. i want
everybody else

06:27.688 --> 06:29.122
to finish reading
"daisy miller"
for monday.

06:29.156 --> 06:30.190
thank you.

06:30.223 --> 06:31.959
that's all.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.570
hey.

06:45.172 --> 06:47.007
hi.

06:48.576 --> 06:50.611
hey, how's it going?

06:54.782 --> 06:55.983
hey!

06:56.016 --> 06:57.451
oh, hey, jackson...

06:57.485 --> 06:59.052
i've been leaving you
messages and e-mail.

06:59.086 --> 07:00.588
oh, yeah, i got
to get to practice.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.889
i wanted to ask you...

07:01.922 --> 07:03.957
i'm sorry. i'm on,
like, total overload.

07:03.991 --> 07:05.826
i don't know if you've
seen the flyers yet,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.995
but my band's playing
friday night at
the wild coyote.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.130
you know, they haven't
posted the names yet,

07:10.163 --> 07:12.533
but i think i'm
traveling with the team

07:12.566 --> 07:14.067
to the practice meet
in portland.

07:14.101 --> 07:17.671
oh, great.
i mean for you.

07:17.705 --> 07:19.473
but if you get back on
saturday, you know...

07:19.507 --> 07:21.174
saturday. saturday's
a travel day.

07:21.208 --> 07:22.409
and then
i have all this laundry,

07:22.442 --> 07:24.845
and i have to get
my paperwork in for
my chinese fellowship.

07:24.878 --> 07:25.979
so...
well...sunday.

07:26.013 --> 07:29.917
oh, you know,
i've sworn off going
with guys in bands.

07:29.950 --> 07:31.919
well, it's not
a very good band.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.754
did you see the review
in the "student voice"?

07:33.787 --> 07:35.022
no.
they called us...

07:35.055 --> 07:37.157
"derivative with
no sense of
rhythmic identity."

07:37.190 --> 07:42.596
oh, uh, you know,
i'm...i'm sorry, jackson.

07:42.630 --> 07:43.697
i just have

07:43.731 --> 07:44.932
a really heavy class
load,

07:44.965 --> 07:46.700
and, plus, i've started
seeing somebody.

07:46.734 --> 07:48.468
hee hee!

07:52.005 --> 07:53.073
(whistle blowing)

07:53.106 --> 07:56.109
ok, ladies, i want to start
with some split training.

07:56.143 --> 07:58.646
lewisohn, can i
see you for a sec?

08:04.184 --> 08:05.586
i, uh...i thought

08:05.619 --> 08:06.920
you were going to post
the team today.

08:06.954 --> 08:08.121
i am.

08:08.155 --> 08:09.857
well, i've been
putting in some great
times, you know.

08:09.890 --> 08:12.693
every meet i keep--
i keep moving up.

08:12.726 --> 08:16.263
laurel, as coaches, our job
is to protect the health

08:16.296 --> 08:18.966
of our student athletes.

08:18.999 --> 08:23.103
and an eating disorder
can be a real problem.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.575
did...did my mother
talk to you?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.110
she was concerned enough
to drive all the way here

08:30.143 --> 08:32.279
and let us know
of your condition, yeah.

08:32.312 --> 08:34.548
concerned? no...

08:34.582 --> 08:36.884
it's sticking her nose
where it doesn't belong.

08:36.917 --> 08:38.184
all right, look.

08:38.217 --> 08:40.120
before we start going
off on your mom...

08:40.153 --> 08:42.590
when you first tried out
for this track team,

08:42.623 --> 08:45.092
you were asked about
any medical conditions.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.595
yeah, ok.
i dealt with that.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.929
i went in
for treatment.

08:48.962 --> 08:51.699
frankly, laurel, i can see
you've been dropping weight.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.000
i'm hitting my peak.

08:53.033 --> 08:55.335
no, you're overtraining.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.138
you're not
taking me, right?

08:58.171 --> 09:01.609
kyla butler is a senior,
and she's worked very hard.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.110
but i beat her by
more than a minute

09:03.143 --> 09:04.645
at the
invitationals.

09:04.678 --> 09:05.713
laurel, i'm sorry,

09:05.746 --> 09:07.881
but it's not always
about who's best.

09:07.915 --> 09:11.118
you know what?
let's make this easier
for everyone. i quit.

09:11.151 --> 09:12.686
laurel, come on!

09:12.720 --> 09:15.689
what right do you have
to keeping crashing in,

09:15.723 --> 09:17.691
trying to run my life
and screw up everything?

09:17.725 --> 09:18.926
i worry
about you, honey.

09:18.959 --> 09:21.161
you don't know your
limits. you do too much.

09:21.194 --> 09:22.630
i am taking care
of myself.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.032
i'm way more
conscientious.

09:25.065 --> 09:28.602
you chose a double major.
you're studying for china,

09:28.636 --> 09:30.270
and on top of all that,
you do all this running.

09:30.303 --> 09:34.107
yeah. it's called
growing up, mother.

09:35.175 --> 09:37.144
honey, i realize
i can get out of hand.

09:37.177 --> 09:39.346
can we make a deal?

09:40.781 --> 09:41.882
i promise not

09:41.915 --> 09:43.350
to stick my nose
in your business.

09:43.383 --> 09:46.353
you promise me you won't
get in over your head.

09:53.861 --> 09:57.130
well, i met this
great guy, mom,

09:57.164 --> 10:00.067
and he's really
funny and he's smart

10:00.100 --> 10:02.035
and guess what.
he's not in a band.

10:02.069 --> 10:04.371
mm, can i meet him?

10:06.273 --> 10:08.308
well, i guess one
of these weekends

10:08.341 --> 10:10.210
i can ask him to come
down with me to seattle.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.779
on one condition,
though...

10:11.812 --> 10:13.113
i promise.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.082
no judgments.
no judgments.

10:15.115 --> 10:19.386
(both laugh)

10:29.963 --> 10:32.365
(knock at door)

10:32.399 --> 10:33.433
wonderful.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.169
the only time
in her life she's
ever been on time.

10:41.809 --> 10:43.210
hi, darling.
hi.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.945
wow, you made good time.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.914
yeah.

10:46.947 --> 10:48.882
oh, mom,
it smells good.

10:48.916 --> 10:52.285
thank you.
ha ha!

10:52.319 --> 10:54.287
ah, home cooking
again, huh?

10:54.321 --> 10:57.691
sorry, darling.
bringing you up alone

10:57.725 --> 10:59.960
and working did
not leave any time

10:59.993 --> 11:01.128
for cooking lessons.

11:01.161 --> 11:02.095
sue me.

11:02.129 --> 11:04.331
i'm kidding,
all right?

11:04.364 --> 11:06.900
oh, mom...
you, uh...

11:06.934 --> 11:09.970
you might want
to put the oven on.

11:11.204 --> 11:12.773
my lips are sealed.

11:12.806 --> 11:14.441
so where is he?

11:14.474 --> 11:16.910
oh, he just ran down
to pioneer square

11:16.944 --> 11:18.311
to get some flowers.

11:18.345 --> 11:20.881
but, mom, act surprised,
ok, when he comes.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.182
you bet i'll act surprised.

11:22.215 --> 11:23.450
none of your other
boyfriends

11:23.483 --> 11:25.719
ever brought anything
but laundry.

11:25.753 --> 11:27.921
i think you're really
gonna like him.

11:27.955 --> 11:29.857
look at this.

11:29.890 --> 11:31.792
i'm impressed.

11:31.825 --> 11:34.227
i think he likes me.
ha ha!

11:34.261 --> 11:35.295
(knock at door)

11:35.328 --> 11:38.265
wait, no. wait.
wait. wait, mom.
be nice, please.

11:38.298 --> 11:40.367
i promise.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.077
ok.

11:54.514 --> 11:57.384
mom, i'd like you
to meet kevin shane.

11:57.417 --> 12:01.154
mrs. lewisohn:
hi. ha ha. thank you.

12:14.034 --> 12:15.769
laurel didn't tell me you

12:15.803 --> 12:17.104
were such a terrific cook.

12:17.137 --> 12:19.006
thank you so much.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.141
(mom clears throat)

12:21.174 --> 12:22.943
so anyone want
coffee with dessert?

12:22.976 --> 12:24.444
coffee's a really
good idea

12:24.477 --> 12:26.246
considering we have that
2-hour ride back to campus.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.314
yeah.

12:27.347 --> 12:28.381
ride?

12:28.415 --> 12:30.383
uh, kevin has
a motorcycle.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.085
unfortunately,
medical school

12:32.119 --> 12:34.021
doesn't leave any
money for a car.

12:34.054 --> 12:36.589
um, i'll get
the coffee started.

12:40.460 --> 12:42.996
ahem. shall we?

12:44.597 --> 12:46.533
i just hope you
don't become

12:46.566 --> 12:49.870
one of those
overpaid specialists.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.139
with all the misery
in this world,

12:52.172 --> 12:53.473
i want to use what
i learn to help

12:53.506 --> 12:55.308
the people that
really need it.

12:55.342 --> 12:58.111
my father was on
the board of directors
at care share.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.212
really?
yeah.

12:59.246 --> 13:03.050
i have a friend who works
with care share--dr. zola.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.819
yeah.

13:05.853 --> 13:08.021
it-it's a great
program.

13:09.522 --> 13:11.992
well, it's refreshing
to see a young man

13:12.025 --> 13:14.995
who wants to help
other people.

13:15.028 --> 13:16.396
i told laurel--

13:16.429 --> 13:18.531
with her
language background,

13:18.565 --> 13:20.868
i mean, she should
get into journalism.

13:20.901 --> 13:22.035
i mean, then we
can work

13:22.069 --> 13:23.270
in the same places.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.038
we never have to
be apart.

13:25.072 --> 13:28.341
mrs. lewisohn:
aren't you thinking
a little far ahead?

13:28.375 --> 13:32.112
no. i don't think so.

13:33.914 --> 13:38.218
hmm. laurel tells me
you lost your parents.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.921
yeah.

13:40.954 --> 13:45.292
a helicopter skiing
accident in austria.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.427
they were killed
with eight other people.

13:47.460 --> 13:49.496
the whole side of
the mountain came down.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.064
oh...

13:51.098 --> 13:54.902
but they died doing
what they loved.

13:54.935 --> 13:58.105
well? this is
a serious thing?

13:58.138 --> 14:00.407
sex. mother.
the word is "sex."

14:00.440 --> 14:03.076
sex. that's what you're
really asking, right?

14:03.110 --> 14:04.945
well, honey, if
it's gone that far,

14:04.978 --> 14:06.914
i hope
you're being careful.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.082
yes, mother.
that's our deal.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.350
i use my head,

14:10.383 --> 14:11.885
and you will let me
live my life.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.353
right.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.888
well, i'm just glad

14:14.922 --> 14:16.556
he doesn't have a ring
through his nose.

14:16.589 --> 14:18.391
(laurel laughing)

14:18.425 --> 14:20.860
ok, ready to go?

14:22.329 --> 14:25.398
a ring
through my nose?

14:25.432 --> 14:26.333
you should
have told her

14:26.366 --> 14:28.535
i was the high
priest in
a satanic cult.

14:28.568 --> 14:32.339
ha ha! clergy's good.

14:35.943 --> 14:37.911
i love you so much.

14:44.217 --> 14:45.986
not here.

14:46.019 --> 14:48.188
i'm going to be
late for loeb.

14:55.462 --> 14:58.531
so how come you never
talk about your father?

14:58.565 --> 15:00.533
what happened there?

15:02.035 --> 15:04.137
well, after
they divorced,

15:04.171 --> 15:07.174
two years later,
he died.

15:07.207 --> 15:09.442
you remember him?

15:09.476 --> 15:13.313
no. not well.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.481
yeah, i know.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.449
i didn't know
my folks either.

15:16.483 --> 15:18.318
they were always away.

15:19.319 --> 15:22.155
well, we have
that much in common.

15:26.693 --> 15:29.997
we have each other,
right?

15:30.030 --> 15:32.966
yes. and you will
protect me from anyone

15:33.000 --> 15:35.368
and everything
forever. right? hee hee!

15:35.402 --> 15:36.669
bye.

15:36.703 --> 15:39.272

jumped out at me.

16:46.073 --> 16:47.140
you said you were going
to be at the library.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.175
what happened?
where were you?

16:48.208 --> 16:50.277
i had to get out
and run.

16:50.310 --> 16:52.112
for two hours?

16:52.145 --> 16:56.049
laurel, you're not
on the team anymore.

16:56.083 --> 16:59.152

17:06.759 --> 17:09.262
you know, you're not
supposed to be here.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.597
it's not a coed dorm.

17:10.630 --> 17:12.299
why didn't you
return my calls?

17:12.332 --> 17:14.701
what? was there
an emergency?

17:14.733 --> 17:16.536
were you bleeding
to death?

17:16.569 --> 17:20.073
yeah. when i don't see
you, i bleed to death.

17:21.473 --> 17:23.643

this is moving
a little too fast.

17:52.605 --> 17:55.208
you don't even like me.

17:55.242 --> 17:57.710

(giggling)

19:16.623 --> 19:19.192
instructor:

19:19.226 --> 19:20.660
good job, ladies.

19:20.693 --> 19:23.162
(knock at door)

19:28.635 --> 19:31.438
(knock knock)

19:44.651 --> 19:46.719
hey.

19:46.753 --> 19:50.323
i, uh...i was just
in the neighborhood.

19:53.260 --> 19:55.328
the flowers...

19:55.362 --> 19:57.597
were really
beautiful.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.499
they really
touched me.

20:01.268 --> 20:02.769
what time is it?

20:02.802 --> 20:04.371
you want to come in?

20:04.404 --> 20:09.376
no. i'm...i'm already
late for class.

20:17.417 --> 20:18.751
after each fight,

20:18.785 --> 20:22.422
my father would bring me
these coloring books,

20:22.455 --> 20:24.491
and he would bring
my mother

20:24.524 --> 20:26.293
these huge
bouquets of flowers.

20:26.326 --> 20:28.495
and eventually

20:28.528 --> 20:33.466
i guess there was more
fights and less flowers.

20:33.500 --> 20:36.002
i would never stop
the flowers.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.938
that stuff

20:38.971 --> 20:41.274
the other day
at the dorm...

20:43.710 --> 20:45.578
i was way over
the top.

20:45.612 --> 20:47.680
yeah.

20:47.714 --> 20:50.283
you just...you kind
of got in my face.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.419
i know.
i have this thing

20:52.452 --> 20:54.421
about being
abandoned, you know,

20:54.454 --> 20:56.556
and when you wanted
to send me away,

20:56.589 --> 20:59.392
i thought i was
never going
to see you again...

20:59.426 --> 21:01.828
like my parents.

21:05.097 --> 21:07.634
i wasn't sending
you away.

21:10.069 --> 21:12.305
i want to get closer.

21:13.673 --> 21:14.774
i want to...

21:14.807 --> 21:16.743
i want to get
close to you, too.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.647

(ring)

22:24.644 --> 22:26.012

22:28.848 --> 22:30.683
(answering machine beeps)

22:34.587 --> 22:36.589
laurel's mom:
hey, stranger, it's mom.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.725
i wanted to see
how you're doing.

22:38.758 --> 22:40.126
i can't keep up
with your love life,

22:40.159 --> 22:41.794
but if you're
still seeing

22:41.828 --> 22:43.930
that motorcycle guy--
kevin shane?

22:43.963 --> 22:45.732
well, if not,
i wanted to ask you

22:45.765 --> 22:47.767
about my inviting this
terrific law student

22:47.800 --> 22:49.636
who's been helping me
around the office.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.038
let me know, ok?
love you. bye.

22:59.812 --> 23:01.848
you keep talking
about all these plans,

23:01.881 --> 23:04.517
but by the time you get
out of medical school,

23:04.551 --> 23:06.653
i mean, things change,

23:06.686 --> 23:08.455
people change.
not us.

23:08.488 --> 23:09.922
we're going to be
together. i know it.

23:09.956 --> 23:11.724
i don't think
i'm a snob,

23:11.758 --> 23:13.660
but i just--i don't know

23:13.693 --> 23:16.996
about chasing plagues
and famines. i mean...

23:17.029 --> 23:19.031
what ever happened
to good old-fashioned
family medicine?

23:19.065 --> 23:22.134
i just think that
it's something
that i've got to do.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.571
it's something...
that...

23:24.604 --> 23:26.405
(stammers)

23:28.975 --> 23:32.745
i've been given
an opportunity to
put back some good.

23:32.779 --> 23:35.448
you're turning me
into an oil slick.

23:35.482 --> 23:36.783
(chuckles)

23:36.816 --> 23:41.721
sorry.
i just want to keep
your body perfect.

23:41.754 --> 23:44.791
hardly perfect.
come on!

23:46.192 --> 23:47.860
it's the truth.

23:47.894 --> 23:48.995
(giggling)

23:49.028 --> 23:51.564
what? you're laughing.

23:51.598 --> 23:54.133
no. no, it's just...

23:54.166 --> 23:55.735
sometimes you
get so serious.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.770
i am serious.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.908
i mean...

24:01.941 --> 24:04.611
you're so close to
the perfect woman.

24:04.644 --> 24:07.079
i'll never be perfect.

24:15.755 --> 24:17.957
have you ever
thought how you'd
look as a blonde?

24:17.990 --> 24:19.526
(chuckles)

24:19.559 --> 24:21.661
you would be
spectacular.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.767
i think you're trying
to turn me into
something that i'm not.

24:27.800 --> 24:32.071
sexy,
beautiful, hot...

24:32.104 --> 24:35.675
so incredibly hot.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.851
my mom would
have a conniption.

24:44.884 --> 24:46.519
your mother's jealous.

24:46.553 --> 24:47.987
she's always going to
try to keep you down.

24:48.020 --> 24:51.123
shut up. my mom does
not want to keep me down.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.493
you want me
to prove it?

24:59.999 --> 25:01.734
yeah, mom.

25:01.768 --> 25:03.936
um, kevin and i want to come
for a visit this weekend.

25:03.970 --> 25:07.206
yeah. ok, great.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.576
what? no.

25:09.609 --> 25:11.811
mom, you don't have to
worry about the cooking.

25:11.844 --> 25:15.014
ok. oh. and, mom?

25:15.047 --> 25:17.950
i'm going to have
a surprise for you.

25:21.721 --> 25:23.055
ok.

25:41.741 --> 25:43.710
(knocking continues)

25:43.743 --> 25:45.177
coming, honey!

25:51.250 --> 25:52.184
hi.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.586
for you.
thank you.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.221
they're beautiful.

25:55.254 --> 25:56.923
come on in.

25:59.826 --> 26:03.162
so? what do you think?

26:11.403 --> 26:13.572
come on in, honey.

26:21.147 --> 26:23.349
(rock music playing)

26:30.389 --> 26:34.661
you know, it's
a switch to actually
go out with a guy

26:34.694 --> 26:36.162
who knows what he wants
to do with his life.

26:36.195 --> 26:37.630
i don't know.

26:37.664 --> 26:39.832
i think he just
wants to dominate you.

26:39.866 --> 26:41.167
he loves me,

26:41.200 --> 26:43.269
and he's not afraid
to let me know it.

26:43.302 --> 26:45.037
come on.
he's just weird.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.840
i mean, why doesn't he ever
want to hang out with us?

26:47.874 --> 26:51.077
you know.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.379
pre-med.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.949
hi, jacks.
hey.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.685
pull up a chair?

27:01.353 --> 27:02.989
(nervous chuckling)

27:03.022 --> 27:04.824
i'm sorry.

27:20.907 --> 27:22.942
where you going?
it's early.

27:22.975 --> 27:25.845
she's going home
to feed her watchdog.

27:25.878 --> 27:26.946
good night, guys.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.914
good-bye, laurel.

27:27.947 --> 27:31.283
so what are you
guys drinking?

27:31.317 --> 27:33.820
singer:
* she forgot too late

27:35.722 --> 27:38.124
* she forgot too late

27:40.326 --> 27:44.063
* now, would you please
catch me if i fall? *

27:44.096 --> 27:47.767
* i know...

27:51.137 --> 27:52.905
i love that cabin.

27:52.939 --> 27:55.041
too bad i missed going
up there last summer.

27:55.074 --> 27:57.744
i need to drive up
there and check it out.

27:57.777 --> 28:00.046
i haven't been there
in about six months.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.848
can't you just
call the caretaker?

28:01.881 --> 28:03.149
i don't mind going.

28:03.182 --> 28:04.784
gives me a chance
to enjoy the place

28:04.817 --> 28:06.753
without all the kids
and jet-skis.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.054
it's not that far.

28:08.087 --> 28:09.388
i can go up there
some morning.

28:09.421 --> 28:11.423
it terrifies me to think
of you driving around

28:11.457 --> 28:14.326
in that car.

28:14.360 --> 28:17.229
why don't you let me
help you find
something more reliable?

28:17.263 --> 28:19.165
i like my car.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.968
besides, it's
finally paid off.

28:22.001 --> 28:25.171
kevin says it just needs
some timing adjustments.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.372
well, whatever kevin says

28:26.405 --> 28:29.876
i am not taking you
off my auto club card.

28:30.977 --> 28:32.478
you know, if you
decide to come up...

28:32.511 --> 28:33.980
here. just
bring these.
these?

28:34.013 --> 28:35.882
yeah.

28:36.916 --> 28:39.752
kevin's always
talking about making
some big dinner.

28:39.786 --> 28:43.022
last summer, he was
a sous-chef at some
resort in aspen.

28:43.055 --> 28:45.391
i thought he said
he volunteered
with care share.

28:45.424 --> 28:47.459
i don't know. maybe
it was two summers ago.

28:47.493 --> 28:48.828
that first dinner--

28:48.861 --> 28:50.797
he must've known
it was take-out.

28:50.830 --> 28:53.766
no, he thought
it was great.

28:55.968 --> 28:58.437
i can make a reservation
at saddle restaurant.

28:58.470 --> 29:00.072
you don't have to put
on the act anymore.

29:00.106 --> 29:01.407
i know
that you hate him.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.275
when did i ever
say that?

29:03.309 --> 29:07.113
look, mom, this is
the first guy
who truly gets me.

29:07.146 --> 29:08.480
he understands me.

29:08.514 --> 29:10.249
he wants me
in his life.

29:10.282 --> 29:13.419
in fact,
i've decided
to go volunteer

29:13.452 --> 29:15.387
with him next summer
in guatemala.

29:15.421 --> 29:17.156
guatemala?

29:17.189 --> 29:19.191
what about china?

29:19.225 --> 29:21.994
honey, you worked so hard
to get that fellowship.

29:22.028 --> 29:23.329
(chuckles softly)

29:23.362 --> 29:24.797
kevin's right.

29:24.831 --> 29:26.198
what's the point
of studying languages

29:26.232 --> 29:29.168
when people are incapable
of real communication?

29:29.201 --> 29:32.238
honey, this doesn't sound
like you at all.

29:32.271 --> 29:34.340
yeah, well, it is me.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.508
i guess you better
get used to it.

29:41.480 --> 29:43.415
(sea gulls calling)

29:43.449 --> 29:45.517
hey, ben.

29:45.551 --> 29:48.888
jessica, what are
you doing here?

29:48.921 --> 29:49.989
jessica: i know you.

29:50.022 --> 29:52.491
if you're not with
your patients,
you're on your boat.

29:52.524 --> 29:54.260
ha ha!

29:54.293 --> 29:56.963
hi.

29:57.897 --> 29:59.866
is something wrong?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.367
i hope not.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.870
it's just...
it's probably nothing

30:03.903 --> 30:06.205
but i need some
information.

30:06.238 --> 30:07.106
how can i help?

30:07.139 --> 30:08.474
well, you're still
with care share, right?

30:08.507 --> 30:09.341
yes. why?

30:09.375 --> 30:12.879
well, laurel's been
seeing a young man,

30:12.912 --> 30:15.547
and the relationship
troubles me.

30:15.581 --> 30:17.416
i wanted to find out
more about him.

30:17.449 --> 30:19.585
and how does
care share fit in?

30:19.618 --> 30:21.453
his father
was on the board.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.588
you mean
ivan kinsolver?

30:22.621 --> 30:25.057
no, the family name
is shane.

30:25.091 --> 30:27.559
as far as i know,
there's never been
a shane on the board.

30:27.593 --> 30:29.028
well, not anymore.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.629
he died in a skiing
accident last year.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.231
well, it couldn't
be care share.

30:32.264 --> 30:33.933
there hasn't been
a board vacancy

30:33.966 --> 30:36.068
in three years.

30:40.072 --> 30:43.009
it's a gold card.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.244
mm-hmm, yeah. shane.

30:45.277 --> 30:47.279
that is the name
as it appears on the card:

30:47.313 --> 30:49.348
"kevin shane."

30:49.381 --> 30:51.550
my mother's maiden name...

30:51.583 --> 30:53.452
(coughs)

30:57.223 --> 30:58.991
uh, yeah, vickery.

30:59.025 --> 31:01.994
as in "vickery dickory
dock."

31:02.028 --> 31:04.063
(laughs)

31:04.096 --> 31:06.999
well, lost, stolen--
i really don't know.

31:07.033 --> 31:09.401
is there some way
that we can...?

31:09.435 --> 31:11.270
well, if you can pull
it up on the computer,

31:11.303 --> 31:13.572
then we can go over
the last charge records.

31:15.607 --> 31:17.576
yeah, that might help.

31:19.345 --> 31:21.047
yeah.

31:22.348 --> 31:24.450
thursday in whistler.

31:24.483 --> 31:26.152
no. yeah, no, that was me.

31:26.185 --> 31:27.954
i've been on the road.

31:30.957 --> 31:32.324
ok...

31:32.358 --> 31:35.094
friday in vancouver.

31:35.127 --> 31:37.429
no, that's me again.

31:37.463 --> 31:40.632
so what is the last charge
record that you show?

31:43.435 --> 31:46.038
reservation guarantee--
in seattle?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.506
where?

31:49.608 --> 31:52.578
the motor inn tomorrow.

31:53.679 --> 31:56.115
(kids laughing)

32:12.198 --> 32:14.100
hey, kevin.

32:15.467 --> 32:16.602
oh, man.

32:16.635 --> 32:18.104
kevin shane.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.671
billy jones.

32:19.705 --> 32:22.241
yeah.
hey. what a surprise.

32:22.274 --> 32:25.377
well, you changed.
what's different?

32:25.411 --> 32:27.146
no, not much.
oh, my hair.

32:27.179 --> 32:28.614
so what,
are you staying here?

32:28.647 --> 32:30.182
no, no, i'm working.

32:30.216 --> 32:32.051
maintenance and stuff.

32:33.185 --> 32:34.753
so what made you
move to seattle?

32:34.786 --> 32:37.189
finally decided i wanted
a first-class education.

32:37.223 --> 32:38.690
this seems
like the place to be.

32:38.724 --> 32:40.993
that's good, man. i just
never got the impression

32:41.027 --> 32:42.328
you were on
the college track.

32:42.361 --> 32:44.563
yeah.
hey, look, be a buddy

32:44.596 --> 32:47.266
and grab the rest
of my bags
from the jeep, huh?

33:06.385 --> 33:09.755
i mean, you didn't
even hang around
for the grad bash.

33:09.788 --> 33:11.490
no.

33:11.523 --> 33:12.591
after my family died

33:12.624 --> 33:14.493
i just packed my jeep
and left.

33:14.526 --> 33:16.695
weren't you already
admitted to college?

33:16.728 --> 33:18.764
yeah, but i just
kind of needed

33:18.797 --> 33:21.300
some time for myself,
you know?

33:21.333 --> 33:23.102
and now i'm ready
to get back.

33:23.135 --> 33:25.571
all right!
the man is back.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.139
we ought
to celebrate.

33:27.173 --> 33:29.208
the first thing i'm going
to do is hit the shower

33:29.241 --> 33:31.310
and get rid
of this road grime.

33:42.288 --> 33:44.156
hey, billy, what ever
happened to that girl,

33:44.190 --> 33:46.292
uh, erin meadows?

33:47.826 --> 33:49.295
beats me.

33:49.328 --> 33:51.430
(water running)

33:51.463 --> 33:54.266
so you know,
where did she end up?

33:54.300 --> 33:56.168
i mean, weren't you trying

33:56.202 --> 33:58.537
to get into her shorts
or something?

33:59.871 --> 34:01.673
i was just a kid.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.077
so what happened?
did she show up?

34:05.111 --> 34:07.079
i just told you,
i don't know.

34:07.113 --> 34:09.447
all right.

34:09.481 --> 34:11.250
hey, billy, you want to
throw me some shampoo?

34:11.283 --> 34:13.185
it's in
my shaving kit.

34:18.357 --> 34:20.759
billy, come on. today.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.203
(clank)

34:36.675 --> 34:39.077
(indistinct chatter)

34:45.417 --> 34:48.820
those gals put
some locker rooms
to shame, mom.

34:48.853 --> 34:51.290
go, girls.
yeah!

35:01.567 --> 35:03.402
(chuckles)
help?

35:03.435 --> 35:05.171
mm-hmm.

35:05.204 --> 35:06.438
(chuckling)

35:14.346 --> 35:15.881
voila.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.749
(chuckling)

35:19.251 --> 35:22.154
oh. i miss kevin.

35:22.188 --> 35:24.190
honey, i wasn't going
to say anything,

35:24.223 --> 35:26.225
but we need
to talk about kevin.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.627
what about kevin?

35:28.660 --> 35:30.229
i mean...

35:30.262 --> 35:31.463
who is he?

35:31.497 --> 35:33.565
what do you really
know about him?

35:33.599 --> 35:36.535
what's to know?

35:36.568 --> 35:38.804
he's the boy i love
and want to be with.

35:38.837 --> 35:41.673
honey, there are just some
things that don't add up...

35:41.707 --> 35:43.209
things that kevin
told me

35:43.242 --> 35:44.843
about himself
and his family.

35:44.876 --> 35:46.945
ok, so he's a little
insecure,

35:46.978 --> 35:48.847
and he
tends to embellish.

35:48.880 --> 35:50.482
i'm not talking
about embellishment.

35:50.516 --> 35:53.485
look, i think he's
doing amazingly well

35:53.519 --> 35:55.187
considering his
whole family
was wiped out.

35:55.221 --> 35:56.922
this is
about his family.

35:56.955 --> 35:59.458
i saw dr. zola today,

35:59.491 --> 36:00.692
and he told me
something about it.

36:00.726 --> 36:02.261
you've been snooping,
right?

36:02.294 --> 36:03.128
laurel, please...

36:03.161 --> 36:04.796
no, you know what?
you seem to forget

36:04.830 --> 36:06.665
that we had a bargain
here, and, look,

36:06.698 --> 36:08.867
you're still
trying to run my life.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.483
79, 80!

36:57.516 --> 37:01.487
all right!

37:01.520 --> 37:03.689
ooh, happy birthday.

37:03.722 --> 37:05.457
happy birthday.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.025
happy birthday,
grandma.

37:07.058 --> 37:08.860
yay!

37:08.894 --> 37:11.863
(whistling)

37:11.897 --> 37:15.534
(telephone ringing)

37:15.567 --> 37:17.536
woman: your lungs
are still working!

37:17.569 --> 37:19.037
hello?

37:19.070 --> 37:22.308
i miss you, baby.

37:22.341 --> 37:23.475
i miss you, too.

37:23.509 --> 37:24.776
please come home.

37:24.810 --> 37:26.712
i'm so miserable
when you're away.

37:26.745 --> 37:28.614
as soon as
i can get out of here.

37:28.647 --> 37:31.717
i got a surprise for you
when you get back.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.285
(chuckles)

37:33.319 --> 37:35.487
my mother's
driving me crazy.

37:40.592 --> 37:44.029
and, kevin,
i love you.

37:44.062 --> 37:46.532
i love you, too.

37:54.873 --> 37:56.975
i love you, kevin shane.

38:25.537 --> 38:27.673
do you like it?

38:27.706 --> 38:29.541
(giggling):
it's wonderful.

38:29.575 --> 38:32.944
and you don't have to
worry about any neighbors

38:32.978 --> 38:35.381
peeking in
your windows!

38:35.414 --> 38:37.683
oh, it's a fantasy.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.986
is it expensive?

38:41.019 --> 38:43.355
i cut a deal
with these people.

38:43.389 --> 38:45.524
ahh. it's perfect.

38:45.557 --> 38:46.992
and--and there's
trails everywhere.

38:47.025 --> 38:50.028
you can run, you can
study in peace...

38:51.897 --> 38:53.965
oh...

38:53.999 --> 38:55.734
it is awfully
far out.

38:55.767 --> 38:58.404
that's the whole point.

38:58.437 --> 39:01.440
it's out of
the campus scene.

39:20.659 --> 39:21.960
huh?

39:23.061 --> 39:24.896
what?

39:24.930 --> 39:26.432
what is it,
too small?

39:26.465 --> 39:27.766
you don't like
the color?

39:27.799 --> 39:28.700
i mean, tell me.

39:28.734 --> 39:30.035
i'll paint it,
i'll fix it.

39:30.068 --> 39:31.503
i'll--i'll
drywall it.

39:31.537 --> 39:34.039
no, i just...

39:37.142 --> 39:39.144
i kind of feel like
you're pushing.

39:39.177 --> 39:41.413
oh...oh...

39:41.447 --> 39:43.148
it's not up to
your high standards.

39:43.181 --> 39:44.683
is that it?

39:44.716 --> 39:48.186
you know, nothing
i ever do is good
enough for you.

39:48.219 --> 39:51.022
why, no...

39:51.056 --> 39:54.526
i love everything
that you do.

39:54.560 --> 39:58.764
look, i'm just now getting
a sense of who i am.

39:58.797 --> 40:00.899
it just feels
so impulsive.

40:00.932 --> 40:03.201
i know, i know...
i should...

40:03.234 --> 40:04.269
i should be a little
more hang-loose,

40:04.302 --> 40:06.805
but if i were to
hold back the way
i feel about you

40:06.838 --> 40:09.941
then i would...
i would explode.

40:11.677 --> 40:12.978
you don't want me

40:13.011 --> 40:14.913
to go climb a tower
with a gun or...

40:14.946 --> 40:16.748
do you?

40:17.616 --> 40:20.151
no. ha ha!

40:20.185 --> 40:22.688
i wouldn't want you
to do that.

40:24.590 --> 40:27.559
you can go home
any time you want.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.162
i'm just too cautious.

40:31.196 --> 40:32.664
no, you're not.

40:32.698 --> 40:33.999
i mean, it's fine.

40:34.032 --> 40:35.133
we got...we got
so much time.

40:35.166 --> 40:37.168
we got all the time
in the world.

40:54.219 --> 40:56.655
woman: the number you have
reached is not in service.

40:56.688 --> 40:59.090
please check the number
and try again.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.926
(hangs up)

41:00.959 --> 41:03.895
(dialing)

41:03.929 --> 41:05.664
(line connecting)

41:05.697 --> 41:07.933
the number you have reached
is not in service...

41:07.966 --> 41:09.935
(hangs up)

41:35.126 --> 41:37.796
hey. how's it going?

41:37.829 --> 41:40.165
i got done early.

41:41.933 --> 41:43.268
i wanted everything
to be done

41:43.301 --> 41:44.770
before you got here.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.171
oh, well, could i
help with any..?

41:46.204 --> 41:48.940
no! um, heh heh.
open the wine.

41:48.974 --> 41:50.075
relax.

41:50.108 --> 41:51.810
ok.

41:51.843 --> 41:53.779
oh, the food looks great.

41:53.812 --> 41:55.213
have you been
cooking long?

41:55.246 --> 41:56.915
no, about an hour.

41:56.948 --> 42:00.151
oh, hey, did the phone
guy show up today?

42:00.185 --> 42:01.653
oh, yeah...

42:01.687 --> 42:03.154
still something screwy
with the wiring.

42:03.188 --> 42:05.023
it's going to be
a couple more days.

42:05.056 --> 42:07.292
a couple more days?

42:07.325 --> 42:08.960
you know,
i really don't like

42:08.994 --> 42:11.262
being out this far
without a phone.

42:11.296 --> 42:13.098
ow!

42:14.900 --> 42:16.201
damn it!

42:16.234 --> 42:17.903
(bird cawing)

42:26.812 --> 42:28.680
(bell ringing)

42:28.714 --> 42:30.949
(indistinct conversations)

43:23.669 --> 43:25.671
kevin.

43:38.349 --> 43:40.318
kevin.

43:40.351 --> 43:41.352
mrs. lewisohn.

43:41.386 --> 43:43.789
what's happening with my
daughter? where is she?

43:43.822 --> 43:44.956
if i see her...

43:44.990 --> 43:46.191
don't give me
that nonsense.

43:46.224 --> 43:47.726
you know perfectly
well where she is.

43:47.759 --> 43:49.995
whatever your
relationship with laurel is

43:50.028 --> 43:52.097
i don't want
any part of that.

43:52.130 --> 43:54.132
i don't believe
you, kevin.

43:54.165 --> 43:55.366
i don't believe
anything

43:55.400 --> 43:57.335
about you.

43:57.368 --> 43:58.970
laurel listens
to me now.

43:59.004 --> 44:01.773
i don't know
what your game is,

44:01.807 --> 44:03.108
but i'm going
to make sure

44:03.141 --> 44:05.076
that laurel knows
you're a liar.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.979
laurel and i are in love.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.681
both of us would rather die

44:09.715 --> 44:11.750
than let you come
between that love.

44:28.233 --> 44:30.435
laurel: you know,
i told my mom how
you love to cook,

44:30.468 --> 44:32.170
and--hee hee--

44:32.203 --> 44:33.772
and i thought
maybe next time

44:33.805 --> 44:36.274
she comes up, you could
do something special.

44:36.307 --> 44:38.443
'cause i know if,
you know,

44:38.476 --> 44:40.678
the two of you got
to know each other...

44:42.848 --> 44:44.783
(owl hoots)

44:44.816 --> 44:46.985
you hardly touched
your food.

44:47.018 --> 44:49.354
uh...i'm not
that hungry.

44:53.992 --> 44:55.460
are you sure?

44:55.493 --> 44:57.963
yeah. why?

44:57.996 --> 45:00.465
no. no, nothing, nothing.

45:02.167 --> 45:04.402
what?
what's going on?

45:06.938 --> 45:09.975
i don't want to
stir things up.

45:10.008 --> 45:12.343
what are you
talking about?

45:13.311 --> 45:15.781
your mom called me
the other day.

45:15.814 --> 45:17.115
my mother?

45:17.148 --> 45:18.850
why? what about?

45:18.884 --> 45:21.252
to talk about you.

45:22.253 --> 45:24.255
i can't believe this.

45:25.891 --> 45:27.125
she...

45:27.158 --> 45:29.895
she said that you had
an eating disorder.

45:31.897 --> 45:33.932
she told you?

45:33.965 --> 45:35.901
well, she told me that...

45:35.934 --> 45:38.069
she told me that it was
an emotional problem

45:38.103 --> 45:41.372
and that you had to be
put in the hospital.

45:41.406 --> 45:43.108
how could she do this?

45:43.141 --> 45:45.010
hey, i'm sorry,
i'm sorry.

45:45.043 --> 45:47.512
i had to tell you.

45:47.545 --> 45:50.215
no. i understand.

45:50.248 --> 45:52.918
she is completely
against us.

45:56.554 --> 45:58.356
your mother...

45:58.389 --> 46:00.959
is set on ruining
our relationship.

46:00.992 --> 46:02.994
hey, where
are you going?

46:03.028 --> 46:04.930
i am going to go
call her and tell
her to go to...

46:04.963 --> 46:07.032
no, no, no, no...

46:07.065 --> 46:08.566
what?
no!

46:08.599 --> 46:11.469
that's what
she wants.

46:11.502 --> 46:13.004
she wants
to make trouble.

46:13.038 --> 46:15.540
this isn't about
your mother.

46:15.573 --> 46:18.409
this is about
you and me--

46:18.443 --> 46:20.979
you and me.

46:21.012 --> 46:22.981
i mean, we got to
start our own life.

46:23.014 --> 46:24.883
this is our home.

46:25.984 --> 46:28.286
you don't have
to leave.

46:30.288 --> 46:35.293
nobody is ever
going to run
your life again...

46:36.527 --> 46:38.296
ever.

47:04.956 --> 47:07.258
(plates, bowls
slide across table)

47:30.081 --> 47:31.349
well, we had
a lit class at 2:00.

47:31.382 --> 47:32.918
so i waited around
for, like, over
a half an hour

47:32.951 --> 47:34.652
but she never
showed.

47:34.685 --> 47:37.588
i don't understand
any of this.

47:37.622 --> 47:40.158
mazie, who is
this kevin shane?

47:40.191 --> 47:41.392
i don't know...

47:41.426 --> 47:42.928
i mean, i know he comes
from the denver area.

47:42.961 --> 47:44.162
pretty much keeps
to himself.

47:44.195 --> 47:45.931
i can't even say
i've ever seen him

47:45.964 --> 47:47.966
with any friends
or anything.

47:47.999 --> 47:49.567
what'd they say
at the dean's office?

47:49.600 --> 47:51.269
nothing.

47:51.302 --> 47:52.303
no laws have been broken,

47:52.337 --> 47:54.105
so privacy laws
prevent them

47:54.139 --> 47:56.541
from giving me
any information.

47:56.574 --> 47:58.543
do you think
i'm crazy?

47:58.576 --> 48:00.245
am i jumping
to wild conclusions?

48:00.278 --> 48:01.146
of course not.

48:01.179 --> 48:02.680
look, i just don't know
what set her off.

48:02.713 --> 48:04.282
you know, monday,
i get back to the dorm

48:04.315 --> 48:06.952
and her stuff had been
totally cleared out.

48:06.985 --> 48:08.954
nothing,
no forwarding address?

48:08.987 --> 48:10.321
nothing. i even tried
phoning his apartment

48:10.355 --> 48:12.123
but there was no answer.

48:38.249 --> 48:40.485
(engine sputtering)

48:54.332 --> 48:56.467
i don't believe this.

49:16.254 --> 49:18.556
laurel: i had to walk two miles
to get to that pay phone.

49:18.589 --> 49:20.558
i couldn't reach
mazie, nobody...

49:20.591 --> 49:22.060
and if i miss another lab

49:22.093 --> 49:24.329
peterson is going
to axe me for sure.

49:24.362 --> 49:28.433
jackson: listen, you got
to get out. you got
to have some laughs.

49:28.466 --> 49:29.400
friday night,
rymes with orange

49:29.434 --> 49:33.671
is playing at the coyote
if you're interested.

49:33.704 --> 49:34.772
thanks, but...

49:34.805 --> 49:36.407
not like a date
or anything--

49:36.441 --> 49:38.076
just a friend thing.

49:38.109 --> 49:39.444
i can't.

49:39.477 --> 49:41.512
why? oh, 'cause
of kevin.

49:41.546 --> 49:44.115
man, that guy
practically owns you.

49:44.149 --> 49:46.451
you used to laugh
and have such a good time.

49:57.128 --> 50:00.765
yes. hi. this is
laurel lewisohn.

50:00.798 --> 50:03.368
ok. i finally
got someone at
the phone company.

50:12.177 --> 50:13.544
i don't know why they
can't put a phone there.

50:13.578 --> 50:14.645
they can put a phone
anywhere.

50:14.679 --> 50:18.015
yes, yes,
i'm still here.

50:19.417 --> 50:21.286
no order?

50:21.319 --> 50:23.121
did you look up
my name as well?

50:24.555 --> 50:26.257
yes...

50:26.291 --> 50:28.359
thank you very much.

50:29.827 --> 50:33.131
there was never
a phone order.

50:33.164 --> 50:35.833
he never put in
for a phone order.

50:35.866 --> 50:37.702
he lied to me.

50:37.735 --> 50:39.770
jackson, i just...

50:39.804 --> 50:42.707
i know that he messed
with my car.

50:42.740 --> 50:47.145
all he wants to do
is keep me a prisoner.

51:31.322 --> 51:32.523
this way.

51:32.557 --> 51:33.791
thank you so much
for this.

51:33.824 --> 51:35.426
my son will be
very grateful.

51:35.460 --> 51:36.327
mm-hmm.

51:36.361 --> 51:38.296
he's sure he left it
behind when he moved.

51:38.329 --> 51:39.664
uh-huh.

51:42.667 --> 51:43.834
i'll be upstairs.

51:43.868 --> 51:45.803
call me
when you're done.

52:17.635 --> 52:19.570
(clatter)

52:37.288 --> 52:39.257
i told you on the phone,
mrs. lewisohn,

52:39.290 --> 52:40.591
you are wasting
your time

52:40.625 --> 52:41.926
coming all the way
to colorado.

52:41.959 --> 52:42.760
there's nothing
i can do for you.

52:42.793 --> 52:44.662
i just didn't know
where else to turn.

52:44.695 --> 52:46.797
we have nothing
on kevin shane.

52:46.831 --> 52:48.799
his parents died
in a ski accident--

52:48.833 --> 52:50.368
nothing suspicious
about it.

52:50.401 --> 52:51.769
he wasn't even here
when it happened.

52:51.802 --> 52:53.671
no record?
no, i told you.

52:53.704 --> 52:55.373
if there was something
as a juvenile,

52:55.406 --> 52:57.242
it would be sealed.
i see.

52:57.275 --> 52:58.643
sorry. look,
i'll keep my ear

52:58.676 --> 52:59.944
to the ground. if something
comes up, i'll call you.

52:59.977 --> 53:03.314
ok. thank you very
much for your time.

53:14.325 --> 53:17.462
excuse me.
detective unger?

53:17.495 --> 53:18.563
do you know who
this girl is--

53:18.596 --> 53:20.865
erin meadows?

53:20.898 --> 53:22.467
yeah. she disappeared
about two years ago.

53:22.500 --> 53:24.435
why?

53:25.636 --> 53:28.239
kevin had a photograph
of her in his apartment.

53:28.273 --> 53:30.408
i mean, it didn't have
the writing on it

53:30.441 --> 53:31.809
but it's the same girl--
i'm sure of it--

53:31.842 --> 53:34.579
and she looks
a lot like my daughter.

53:35.980 --> 53:38.416
i busted my butt
on that case.

53:38.449 --> 53:39.550
the parents
were devastated.

53:39.584 --> 53:40.618
nothing ever came
of it.

53:40.651 --> 53:41.886
did she know
kevin shane?

53:41.919 --> 53:43.321
they may have gone to
the same school.

53:43.354 --> 53:44.489
but i have
no connection.

53:44.522 --> 53:45.556
could you find out?

53:45.590 --> 53:47.892
yeah. i still
have my files, but
i would remember.

53:47.925 --> 53:49.794
i had a very strong
suspicion

53:49.827 --> 53:51.829
about a boy named
billy jones.

53:51.862 --> 53:53.431
the name familiar?

53:53.464 --> 53:54.632
no.

53:54.665 --> 53:57.302
no. listen, i'm booked
out of denver tonight.

53:57.335 --> 54:00.271
would you please call me
if you find out anything?

54:00.305 --> 54:01.572
here's my card.

54:01.606 --> 54:04.875
call collect anytime
day or night.

54:06.777 --> 54:08.446
thank you.

54:27.465 --> 54:29.834
oh, hi, jess.
it's martin price.

54:29.867 --> 54:32.403
i'm at the office.
give me a call...

54:32.437 --> 54:34.605
woman: hi. this
is lotus video calling.

54:34.639 --> 54:36.341
you've got
an overdue tape...

54:36.374 --> 54:38.909
hello, mrs. lewisohn.
it's detective unger.

54:38.943 --> 54:40.077
i tried to page you
at the airport,

54:40.110 --> 54:42.380
but i guess your flight
left on time.

54:42.413 --> 54:45.416
anyway, i'm faxing you
what i have on kevin shane.

54:45.450 --> 54:47.452
no priors,
no juvenile record,

54:47.485 --> 54:49.654
pretty squeaky-clean
all around.

54:49.687 --> 54:51.622
i don't suppose
this is much help to you,

54:51.656 --> 54:53.524
but it's all we've got.

54:53.558 --> 54:56.327
my god, it's not him.

55:05.403 --> 55:06.371
hi, detective unger.

55:06.404 --> 55:07.472
thank you
for getting back to me.

55:07.505 --> 55:09.006
i just picked up
your page. is
everything all right?

55:09.039 --> 55:11.709
that picture of
kevin shane--
it's not the same boy.

55:11.742 --> 55:13.644
well, it's the only
kevin shane we've got.

55:13.678 --> 55:17.382
well, what about
that other boy?

55:17.415 --> 55:18.783
the one you think
killed the girl?

55:18.816 --> 55:20.518
can you get me
his picture?

55:20.551 --> 55:21.652
billy jones?

55:21.686 --> 55:24.054
yeah.
i'll see what i can do.

55:24.088 --> 55:25.723
i'll get back to you.

55:25.756 --> 55:27.592
ok. thank you.

55:31.729 --> 55:34.965
(engine running)

55:37.134 --> 55:39.537
(motorcycle approaching)

55:58.489 --> 56:00.891
hey, laur....

56:00.925 --> 56:03.661
honey, do you know that
your car's still running?

56:03.694 --> 56:05.563
i was afraid
to turn it off.

56:05.596 --> 56:07.832
the guy from
the auto club said
a wire's missing.

56:07.865 --> 56:09.099
i know you did
something to it.

56:09.133 --> 56:10.167
honey,
i would never...

56:10.200 --> 56:11.969
i know you never
even placed an order
for the phone.

56:12.002 --> 56:13.070
well, someone
must have screwed up.

56:13.103 --> 56:14.071
stop lying.

56:14.104 --> 56:16.941
all you want to do is
keep me locked away here.

56:16.974 --> 56:18.075
that is not true.

56:18.108 --> 56:19.410
i got this place.

56:19.444 --> 56:20.545
i-i took out a lease.

56:20.578 --> 56:21.679
i went into hock for us.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.080
i know you follow me.

56:23.113 --> 56:24.649
people see you spying.

56:24.682 --> 56:26.417
your friends
are against us.

56:26.451 --> 56:28.486
i told you that.

56:29.219 --> 56:30.788
oh, you found
someone else.

56:30.821 --> 56:32.623
yeah. how would
i have the time?

56:32.657 --> 56:33.958
you're all over me
every second.

56:33.991 --> 56:35.926
oh, well, then
take your crap!

56:35.960 --> 56:37.962
here! take all of it!

56:37.995 --> 56:39.196
go to hell.

56:39.229 --> 56:40.831
what? are you going
to let me out?

56:40.865 --> 56:43.468
laurel, laurel, laurel,
look, i know i'm obsessive,

56:43.501 --> 56:44.702
but i wouldn't
be like this

56:44.735 --> 56:45.936
if i didn't
love you so much.

56:45.970 --> 56:50.641
no. this is not love,
not a normal love.

56:50.675 --> 56:52.577
i don't know
what this is.

56:54.845 --> 56:56.647
listen, listen.

56:57.682 --> 56:59.717
i know you love me.

56:59.750 --> 57:02.152
and i think we just need
to step back and relax.

57:02.186 --> 57:04.054
i know you love me.

57:04.088 --> 57:05.089
i love you.

57:05.122 --> 57:07.558
kevin, please! please!

57:09.960 --> 57:12.863
ok, let me help you
with your stuff.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.440
aah!

57:23.974 --> 57:25.676

57:25.710 --> 57:27.077
laurel, listen,

57:27.111 --> 57:28.646

tomorrow night?

57:28.679 --> 57:29.780
i'll make reservations
at the carriage house.

57:29.814 --> 57:31.582
we'll have a nice
romantic dinner!

57:31.616 --> 57:32.917

57:32.950 --> 57:34.685
laurel!

57:51.602 --> 57:53.838
(rock music playing)

57:59.009 --> 58:01.211

58:03.714 --> 58:05.182
oh, no.

58:05.215 --> 58:08.018
no, no, no strings,
no expectations.

58:08.052 --> 58:09.720
look, it's just
there's, uh...

58:09.754 --> 58:11.922
some unfinished
business between me and kevin

58:11.956 --> 58:15.726
and until i...
sort things out

58:15.760 --> 58:16.927
i don't want to feel
sleazy, you know?

58:16.961 --> 58:18.028
i understand.

58:18.062 --> 58:19.697
ok?

58:19.730 --> 58:20.898

59:45.315 --> 59:46.784
if i ever catch you
sneaking round

59:46.817 --> 59:47.918
my girl again...

59:47.952 --> 59:49.019
man, take a hike.

59:49.053 --> 59:50.154
i'm warning you!

59:50.187 --> 59:52.056
you don't go
near her!

59:59.063 --> 01:00:00.931
little weasel.

01:00:14.111 --> 01:00:15.345
you keep following me.

01:00:15.379 --> 01:00:17.314
i'm really sorry
about what happened.

01:00:17.347 --> 01:00:19.049
it was all my fault.

01:00:19.083 --> 01:00:20.350
can we just talk?

01:00:20.384 --> 01:00:21.886
i'm done with talking.

01:00:21.919 --> 01:00:24.021
just to listen
to what i have to say.

01:00:24.054 --> 01:00:27.224
i know i screwed up.

01:00:27.257 --> 01:00:29.293
can you just give me
another chance?

01:00:29.326 --> 01:00:30.394
i love you.
you know it.

01:00:30.427 --> 01:00:34.965
no. i don't know
anymore.

01:00:34.999 --> 01:00:36.934
last chance.

01:00:36.967 --> 01:00:39.269
i swear, last chance.

01:00:39.303 --> 01:00:42.740
fine, but not here.

01:00:42.773 --> 01:00:44.241
we'll talk...we'll
talk outside, ok?

01:00:44.274 --> 01:00:46.711
we'll talk.
just talk, ok?

01:00:57.922 --> 01:00:59.924
look, i know i've
been acting crazy.

01:00:59.957 --> 01:01:01.826
i don't have a life
unless you're in it.

01:01:01.859 --> 01:01:05.029
yeah, but i do have a life.

01:01:05.062 --> 01:01:06.764
man: watch it, man.

01:01:06.797 --> 01:01:07.932
what are you doing?

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:08.999
stay out of this.

01:01:09.033 --> 01:01:10.267
big idiot! uh!

01:01:10.300 --> 01:01:13.804
kevin, don't!
don't!

01:01:13.838 --> 01:01:14.671
hey, come on...

01:01:14.705 --> 01:01:16.273
he's got a knife!
let's get out of here!

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:17.307
let's go!

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.276
you'd better
move, boy!

01:01:21.078 --> 01:01:23.280
(rock music continues)

01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:38.395
(sirens, indistinct chatter)

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:47.905
so two years ago, they
tore the building down

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:50.007
pour a layer
of cheap concrete

01:01:50.040 --> 01:01:51.942
and bingo, they had
a parking lot

01:01:51.976 --> 01:01:53.343
for the new mall.

01:01:53.377 --> 01:01:54.845
that was recession time.

01:01:54.879 --> 01:01:56.280
now they're at it again.

01:01:56.313 --> 01:01:58.515
erin meadows
disappeared
two years ago.

01:01:58.548 --> 01:02:00.250
why do you think
it's erin meadows?

01:02:00.284 --> 01:02:02.286
because it's
a small town.

01:02:02.319 --> 01:02:04.221
you really think it's her?

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:05.355
well, we'll find out

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:06.991
when pathology's
done with the teeth.

01:02:07.024 --> 01:02:08.959
officer: if they
find any.

01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:11.195
(police radio transmissions)

01:03:36.580 --> 01:03:38.015
welcome back.

01:03:38.048 --> 01:03:39.283
i just came
for my things.

01:03:39.316 --> 01:03:41.218
i don't need any grief.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.888
no. no grief, i swear.

01:03:43.921 --> 01:03:45.923
i realize now i need help.

01:03:45.956 --> 01:03:48.358
i need...
i need professional help.

01:03:48.392 --> 01:03:50.460
but i drove you away.

01:03:50.494 --> 01:03:52.963
i know.
i know what i did.

01:03:52.997 --> 01:03:57.467
it's just, i never
learned to trust love, or...

01:03:57.501 --> 01:03:59.336
how one minute
you could...

01:03:59.369 --> 01:04:01.939
you could be so
sweet and wonderful.

01:04:02.472 --> 01:04:04.141
i don't know.

01:04:11.248 --> 01:04:15.619
i don't know how i'm
going to get over this.

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:17.888
i mean, it's--it's going
to take the kind of time

01:04:17.922 --> 01:04:19.856
that breaks
mountains down.

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:25.562
there were good times,
though, right?

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.264
i mean, there were
some good times, you know?

01:04:27.297 --> 01:04:28.465
weren't there?

01:04:28.498 --> 01:04:30.167
i have to leave.

01:04:31.468 --> 01:04:32.536
i know. i know.

01:04:32.569 --> 01:04:34.171
i won't hold you.

01:04:36.140 --> 01:04:38.008
here.
please!

01:04:38.042 --> 01:04:40.945
ok, i'll just let you...

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:51.922
laur...

01:04:54.358 --> 01:04:56.460
i just...i won't feel
like such a failure

01:04:56.493 --> 01:04:59.964
if we can just end...
end as friends, you know?

01:05:01.431 --> 01:05:03.233
please?

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:04.701
we'll just toast
the good times.

01:05:04.734 --> 01:05:06.636
please?

01:05:30.227 --> 01:05:31.728
you thought it was
going to be easy

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:33.563
to get away from me.

01:05:37.301 --> 01:05:40.037
yeah. it's coming
over the fax right now.

01:05:40.070 --> 01:05:42.206
unger: yeah. we had
a good picture on file.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:48.112
oh, it's him.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:49.479
billy jones.

01:05:49.513 --> 01:05:50.447
are you sure?

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:56.120
yes. he's a killer,
and he's got my daughter.

01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:13.103
(grunts)

01:06:44.668 --> 01:06:47.437
jessica:
you spoke to colorado.

01:06:47.471 --> 01:06:48.805
that boy is a killer.

01:06:48.838 --> 01:06:50.640
the boy was knocked
around a few foster homes.

01:06:50.674 --> 01:06:52.276
that doesn't
make him a killer.

01:06:52.309 --> 01:06:53.777
you talked to
detective unger.

01:06:53.810 --> 01:06:55.512
they found
that girl's body.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:06:57.547
he's got to
be a suspect.

01:06:57.581 --> 01:06:59.516
a suspect in what may
or not be a homicide.

01:06:59.549 --> 01:07:01.285
they haven't identified
the body yet.

01:07:01.318 --> 01:07:03.687
officer, my daughter
is missing.

01:07:03.720 --> 01:07:06.390
mrs. lewisohn, i
understand how you feel.

01:07:06.423 --> 01:07:08.392
i have a daughter myself.

01:07:08.425 --> 01:07:09.726
my hands are tied.

01:07:09.759 --> 01:07:11.795
i can't make a move until
there's more solid evidence.

01:07:11.828 --> 01:07:14.030
like my daughter's
body.

01:07:15.332 --> 01:07:16.700
i'm sorry,
mrs. lewisohn.

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:18.168
i have to go.

01:07:18.202 --> 01:07:20.404
(police radio transmissions)

01:07:44.461 --> 01:07:46.430
(tires pop)

01:08:00.910 --> 01:08:02.246
(horn honking)

01:08:02.279 --> 01:08:04.781
somebody really
screwed this thing up.

01:08:04.814 --> 01:08:08.452
yeah, probably that
idiot at the dealership.

01:08:09.719 --> 01:08:11.221
no guarantees.

01:08:11.255 --> 01:08:12.822
let me write you up.

01:08:15.259 --> 01:08:16.693
is this
miss lewisohn's card?

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.827
yeah.

01:08:17.861 --> 01:08:19.662
i called it in.

01:08:19.696 --> 01:08:21.665
i have to have
a member sign for it.

01:08:23.233 --> 01:08:25.402
well, i'll give it
a try if you want, man.

01:08:25.435 --> 01:08:27.437
last time i tried, she
threw up all over me.

01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.706
(radio transmissions)

01:08:33.743 --> 01:08:35.578
good luck.

01:08:42.185 --> 01:08:43.720
see you.

01:08:55.832 --> 01:08:57.567
any way you can
put me in touch

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:58.768

01:11:21.611 --> 01:11:23.313

01:11:24.514 --> 01:11:25.915
not worthy because
of where i come from,

01:11:25.949 --> 01:11:27.684
because i never
had the money.

01:11:27.717 --> 01:11:30.720
what money? what are
you talking about?

01:11:30.754 --> 01:11:32.322
you're the one who
was always talking

01:11:32.356 --> 01:11:33.390
about your parents
going skiing in europe.

01:11:33.423 --> 01:11:35.459
i didn't have
any parents!

01:11:35.492 --> 01:11:36.993

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:39.496
my...my...

01:11:39.529 --> 01:11:40.830
my parents were phonies.

01:11:40.864 --> 01:11:42.366
they were trying to be
something that they weren't.

01:11:42.399 --> 01:11:43.933
they lied to me,
like you.

01:11:43.967 --> 01:11:45.735
no, no.

01:11:45.769 --> 01:11:46.636

01:11:55.812 --> 01:11:59.449
but i lied about
wanting us to break up.

01:11:59.483 --> 01:12:01.818
it wasn't me
who wanted to end this.

01:12:01.851 --> 01:12:04.454
it was my mother.

01:12:04.488 --> 01:12:08.458
she hates you
because you
make me happy.

01:12:10.126 --> 01:12:13.730
she hates you
because i love you.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:16.466

i love you so much.

01:12:28.445 --> 01:12:30.847

to me...

01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:35.385
no. no, i want you...

01:12:35.419 --> 01:12:38.455
to believe me, ok?

01:12:38.488 --> 01:12:39.989
if you're lying to me,

01:12:40.023 --> 01:12:42.526

you make love to me.

01:13:37.881 --> 01:13:39.749

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:04.941

to scare you.

01:14:34.671 --> 01:14:36.573
