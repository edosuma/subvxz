00:10.967 --> 00:12.360
Still can't
afford to buy a boat.

00:12.490 --> 00:13.926
You know what they used
to call me in the army, right?

00:14.057 --> 00:16.364
-Mr. Fish and Loaves.
-That's right! That's right!

00:16.494 --> 00:19.193
No matter what the resources,
I would make it work.

00:19.323 --> 00:21.630
-Dad!
-Oh!

00:21.760 --> 00:23.545
Welcome
to your worst nightmare.

00:25.808 --> 00:28.332
It's Mom. I think this
place is starting to get to her.

00:28.463 --> 00:29.507
You've been going out there
for weeks now,

00:29.638 --> 00:31.335
and you're not seeing
what's happening here.

00:31.466 --> 00:33.468
Help your Mom get everybody
secured, tucked away.

00:33.598 --> 00:36.166
And when I get home tonight, we
will talk.

00:36.297 --> 00:37.341
I promise.

00:46.742 --> 00:48.439
The only way
for us to go home

00:48.570 --> 00:49.832
is to wake everyone up.

00:49.962 --> 00:51.790
-Abby, stop!

00:51.921 --> 00:53.836
I found something, s-something
I think is gonna help us.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.446
Mom!

00:55.577 --> 00:57.361
-No, no!

00:57.492 --> 00:59.363
-They're in the house!

01:01.887 --> 01:03.454
We have to go.

01:03.585 --> 01:05.630
Go where?
Where are we going?

01:05.761 --> 01:07.284
You go first.

01:07.415 --> 01:09.373
I'll follow you down.

01:09.504 --> 01:10.113
We need to get to town.

01:11.549 --> 01:13.290
No. We have to go to the trees.

01:13.421 --> 01:15.379
You have to get inside.

01:15.510 --> 01:16.467
The tree? No!

01:16.598 --> 01:17.599
You'll be safe!

01:17.729 --> 01:19.209
-What?
-I promise.

01:19.340 --> 01:20.732
-Go, go!
-No, wait!

01:20.863 --> 01:23.170
Find your brother.
I'll be right behind--

01:24.954 --> 01:27.348
You went through
a Farway tree!

01:27.478 --> 01:28.610
-Honey...
-What is going on?

01:28.740 --> 01:30.307
What's happening?

01:30.438 --> 01:33.005
We're digging a big hole
in the basement.

01:33.136 --> 01:35.486
We're gonna find out where
the electricity comes from.

01:35.617 --> 01:37.053
Is anybody out there?

01:37.184 --> 01:40.709
All I got was some static, but it worked.

01:40.839 --> 01:42.232
I think if we get it up
over the tree line,

01:42.363 --> 01:43.842
and we get it enough power,

01:43.973 --> 01:45.409
I think we could
get a signal out.

01:45.540 --> 01:47.498
How do you propose we
get up over the tree line?

01:47.629 --> 01:49.370
We start by going
to the high ground.

01:49.500 --> 01:51.328
If these voices
are real,

01:51.459 --> 01:53.069
if something here is
communicating with you,

01:53.200 --> 01:54.462
then that means you're
connected to this place

01:54.592 --> 01:56.203
in a way that
no one else here is.

01:56.333 --> 01:57.204
But we need proof.

01:57.334 --> 01:58.857
What is this?

01:58.988 --> 02:01.121
They said they
watched you bury the bag

02:01.251 --> 02:04.167
and that this is proof
that they're real.

02:04.298 --> 02:06.430
I have Sara tied up
in the basement of the church.

02:06.561 --> 02:07.953
Tell me you're joking.

02:08.084 --> 02:09.955
That girl may be the key
to unlocking all this.

02:10.086 --> 02:12.915
That girl may be
the way we all go home.

02:13.045 --> 02:14.221

is the right way to go?

my best hunch.

Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Okay.

18:17.661 --> 18:20.534
Okay. We should--
We should stop.

18:20.664 --> 18:22.753
Um, maybe we should
play another game.

18:22.884 --> 18:25.104
What kind of game?

18:26.453 --> 18:27.367
Um...

18:27.497 --> 18:30.065
Okay.

18:30.196 --> 18:32.981
A game called
"When I get home, I..."

18:33.112 --> 18:34.983
And we just say whatever
we're looking forward to

18:35.114 --> 18:36.767
the most about getting home.

18:36.898 --> 18:38.943
I'll start.

18:39.074 --> 18:42.338
When I get home, I...

18:42.469 --> 18:46.429
I will go to Giovelli's

18:46.560 --> 18:48.953
and I will order...

18:49.084 --> 18:50.955
everything on that menu.

18:51.086 --> 18:53.306
Maybe two of everything
on the menu.

18:53.436 --> 18:54.959
Your turn, Jules.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.310
This is stupid.

18:57.440 --> 18:58.746
Oh, come on, Jules.

18:58.876 --> 19:00.313
Fine.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.272
When I get home,
I'm going to, um...

19:06.536 --> 19:10.540
I'm gonna call my friends and...

19:10.671 --> 19:13.804
I'm just gonna call them.

19:15.110 --> 19:18.374
What about you?

19:18.505 --> 19:21.464
When I get home, I...

19:21.595 --> 19:24.554
I want us to be happy,
like we are here.

19:24.685 --> 19:27.818
We never play games
around the table at home.

19:35.391 --> 19:37.219
Okay, look,

19:37.350 --> 19:41.180
most of these batteries are way
past their expiration date.

19:41.310 --> 19:43.225
All right, we've got the
newer batteries from my car

19:43.356 --> 19:46.924
and that giant lunchbox that
you guys were driving, but...

19:48.622 --> 19:50.493
even those'd drain
in a couple of hours.

19:50.624 --> 19:53.453
We need something that'll
keep this running for days

19:53.583 --> 19:56.673
or weeks, right? Not hours.

19:56.804 --> 19:58.545
What we do is we-we
take the batteries,

19:58.675 --> 20:00.329
we put 'em in the cars
and then we just run the cars

20:00.460 --> 20:01.461
to recharge them.

20:01.591 --> 20:03.027
And then what?
Burn how much fuel?

20:03.158 --> 20:04.942
Look, the point is,
you're either burning out

20:05.073 --> 20:06.683
one vital resource or another,

20:06.814 --> 20:09.208
which would be fine if this
was guaranteed to work,

20:09.338 --> 20:10.948
but let's be honest,
man, it probably won't!

20:11.079 --> 20:12.907
Hey. Keep it down.

20:21.220 --> 20:24.571
Has anyone seen Victor?

20:24.701 --> 20:26.877
Look, if you would just
take a look at the symbol.

20:27.008 --> 20:29.010
Open the book!

20:29.140 --> 20:31.578
What is wrong with you?

20:31.708 --> 20:34.537
We have a legitimate chance here
to go home and you're...

20:40.064 --> 20:41.979
You know what?
Just go.

20:42.110 --> 20:44.591
Go.
Go, go find Victor.

20:44.721 --> 20:46.723
Do whatever you want.

20:46.854 --> 20:50.292
I'll stay here, and I'll
figure this out myself.

20:50.423 --> 20:52.381
There's nothing to figure out.
There's no power source.

20:54.340 --> 20:56.298
Jim, this isn't
Gilligan's Island.

20:56.429 --> 20:58.561
You're not gonna build a radio
with palm leaves and coconuts.

20:58.692 --> 21:00.868
Maybe you're not as smart
as you think you are.

21:05.612 --> 21:07.004
Whatever.

21:20.714 --> 21:23.020
What do you want?

21:24.935 --> 21:27.329
I, uh...
I heard what happened.

21:27.460 --> 21:29.592
You okay?

21:29.723 --> 21:32.291
Not my bathroom
the asshole hung himself in.

21:34.684 --> 21:36.512
Shouldn't you be out there

21:36.643 --> 21:39.036
rounding up supplies
or building a spaceship

21:39.167 --> 21:40.473
or some shit?

21:40.603 --> 21:41.691
I'm just saying, if...

21:41.822 --> 21:42.997
if you
want someone to talk to--

21:45.173 --> 21:46.261
Oh, so, now you're sheriff,

21:46.392 --> 21:48.611
you're gonna start
doling out words of wisdom?

21:48.742 --> 21:51.484
One thing I always
appreciated about Boyd

21:51.614 --> 21:53.442
is he minded his own business.

21:56.445 --> 21:59.230
Well, I'm gonna take a few
people down to the barn,

21:59.361 --> 22:01.102
salvage some more wood
for the tower.

22:01.232 --> 22:02.233
Maybe if you want to...

22:02.364 --> 22:04.627
come with us or...
I don't know.

22:04.758 --> 22:06.107
You want wood?

22:07.369 --> 22:10.154
We got plenty of wood.

22:10.285 --> 22:11.765
Where are you going?

22:11.895 --> 22:13.680
Let's get wood!

22:15.856 --> 22:17.423
Donna!

22:17.553 --> 22:18.467
Come on!

22:18.598 --> 22:20.469
I'm saving you a trip!

22:20.600 --> 22:22.079
Donna!

22:25.256 --> 22:27.433
Donna! Hey!

22:30.174 --> 22:31.480
Hey!

22:31.611 --> 22:33.482
Donna!

22:33.613 --> 22:34.831
Donna! Hey!

22:34.962 --> 22:36.790
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

22:36.920 --> 22:38.357
-Hey!
-Donna, wait, wait, wait!

22:38.487 --> 22:40.620
Oh, calm the fuck down!
I'm not a fuckin' psycho.

22:40.750 --> 22:42.665
You said we needed wood?
Let's get wood.

22:42.796 --> 22:44.058
Wha...? Okay.

22:47.235 --> 22:49.237
Donna, please.

22:49.368 --> 22:51.587
Better here than any of
that half-rotten shit

22:51.718 --> 22:53.067
you're gonna pull off the barn.

22:55.504 --> 22:57.811
You gonna get her to stop
or you want me to?

22:57.941 --> 22:59.682
Donna, stop! We need--
we need this place intact.

22:59.813 --> 23:01.815
For what? Huh?

23:01.945 --> 23:03.817
We're all going home, right?

23:03.947 --> 23:06.341
We don't need
this place anymore.

23:06.472 --> 23:09.605
Your glorious tower's
gonna get us all home.

23:09.736 --> 23:12.913
No need to keep
this place standing.

23:13.043 --> 23:16.743
It's not a home anymore.
It's a fucking tomb!

23:18.266 --> 23:20.050
The fuck!

23:20.181 --> 23:21.400
Fuck!

23:29.886 --> 23:31.366
Look, can we please--

23:31.497 --> 23:33.455
Can we please just take
a minute and let's--

23:33.586 --> 23:34.413
Fuck off!

23:40.767 --> 23:41.898
Aw, fuck!

23:43.683 --> 23:46.207
Oh, fuck.
Oh, fuck.

24:08.403 --> 24:11.754
It was nice that Ellis came
to see you before you left.

24:11.885 --> 24:14.104
I'm sure he appreciates
what you're doing.

24:17.368 --> 24:19.806
I heard the story about what
happened with your wife,

24:19.936 --> 24:21.721
what you had to do.

24:21.851 --> 24:23.766
We're not gonna talk
about that.

24:23.897 --> 24:25.942
That's okay.

24:26.073 --> 24:27.204
We don't have to. It's...

24:29.468 --> 24:32.601
It's just, in some ways...

24:32.732 --> 24:35.517
you remind me of Nathan.

24:36.866 --> 24:39.913
I mean, you're a lot
more gruff than he was.

24:40.043 --> 24:43.264
But you always put other
people's needs before your own.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.788
That's how he ended up here.

24:45.919 --> 24:48.356
I don't think he'd like
what we're doing now.

24:48.487 --> 24:49.923
And why is that?

24:50.053 --> 24:53.361
Nathan had a theory
about this place.

24:53.492 --> 24:57.365
If we tried to leave,
if we pushed too hard,

24:57.496 --> 24:59.628
then something
would push back.

25:05.895 --> 25:07.854
What is that?

25:10.813 --> 25:13.120
I don't know.

25:24.305 --> 25:26.960
Are you sure it was
coming from this direction?

25:30.311 --> 25:31.312
Let's go.

25:44.543 --> 25:47.023
I thought you said no one
had been out this far before.

25:49.460 --> 25:50.984
No.

25:57.164 --> 25:58.382
What are you doing?

25:58.513 --> 26:01.081
Look, there's
something inside them.

26:01.211 --> 26:03.039
We gotta get one down.

26:03.170 --> 26:04.214
Just, uh...

26:05.955 --> 26:07.696
Are you sure
that's a good idea?

26:07.827 --> 26:09.045
Maybe we should...

26:11.047 --> 26:11.831
Hey, what's wrong?

26:11.961 --> 26:13.006
Ow!

26:13.136 --> 26:15.008
Ow!

26:15.138 --> 26:16.096
Whoa, Sara.

26:16.226 --> 26:17.837
Ow!

26:17.967 --> 26:20.883
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, you're okay.

26:21.014 --> 26:22.145
-You're okay.
-Ow!

26:22.276 --> 26:23.190
Look at me, Sara.
You're okay.

26:23.320 --> 26:25.018
No! No!

26:25.148 --> 26:26.672
Look...
What's going on?

26:26.802 --> 26:27.803
Sara! Sara!

26:30.023 --> 26:31.328
I can hear them!
I can...

26:31.459 --> 26:32.808
-No, no. Talk to me.

26:32.939 --> 26:34.157
Talk to me. Talk to me.

26:34.288 --> 26:35.724
-No, no, no, no!

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
No! No!

26:37.770 --> 26:40.120
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
Don't, don't! No, no!

26:40.250 --> 26:42.209
No. Sara?
No, no, no. Okay.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.125
No, Sara! Sara! Hey!

26:50.478 --> 26:51.740
How's the magic
tower coming?

26:58.704 --> 27:00.183
You know, all the time
I've been here,

27:00.314 --> 27:01.881
this is first you've
set foot in this place.

27:05.624 --> 27:09.889
Because you serve piss water.
Your distilling is for shit.

27:10.019 --> 27:12.935
At least here,
I can be alone.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.590
Oh.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.374
Kinda feels like
a banner day today.

27:17.505 --> 27:19.899
Feel like
I'm holding court.

27:20.029 --> 27:22.031
You mind
giving us a second?

27:22.162 --> 27:24.773
Yeah.

27:24.904 --> 27:27.428
I'll leave this here.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.299
Give me a holler
if you need anything, okay?

27:34.435 --> 27:37.699
Are you okay?

27:40.354 --> 27:42.008
Donna, I know you're
upset about Eric,

27:42.138 --> 27:43.923
but there's
nothing you could have--

27:44.053 --> 27:46.055
Oh, for fuck's sake,
it's not about that.

27:48.536 --> 27:51.974
Eric punched his own ticket.

27:52.105 --> 27:56.109
Kid's got a right to
go out the way he wants.

27:56.239 --> 27:58.415
Why don't you just
fuck off and leave me be.

27:58.546 --> 28:02.593
Go back to your
little fantasy land.

28:02.724 --> 28:05.814
You don't think
the tower's gonna work.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.643
Do you?

28:08.774 --> 28:13.256
I think it might.
I think it's worth trying.

28:13.387 --> 28:14.823
And what happens
when you fail?

28:17.086 --> 28:18.218
Then we try again.

28:18.348 --> 28:19.436
No!

28:19.567 --> 28:22.265
No, ya stupid little shit.

28:22.396 --> 28:24.964
That's the point.
You don't try again,

28:25.094 --> 28:27.053
because you got
people's hopes up,

28:27.183 --> 28:28.924
you made them believe.

28:29.055 --> 28:31.361
You take that away now
and they're lost,

28:31.492 --> 28:34.713
they give up,
and then they fucking die.

28:37.106 --> 28:41.067
'Cause it isn't some
grade-school softball game

28:41.197 --> 28:43.199
where everyone gets
a participation medal.

28:43.330 --> 28:45.462
You don't know!

28:45.593 --> 28:47.943
You don't remember
what it was like before

28:48.074 --> 28:50.076
because you weren't here.

28:53.209 --> 28:56.212
You wanna know
what I'm grieving?

28:56.343 --> 29:01.043
I'm grieving the loss of what
we almost made this place.

29:01.174 --> 29:04.307
I'm grieving the fact that,
for a little while,

29:04.438 --> 29:07.093
this place almost felt like
something that could work.

29:07.223 --> 29:10.444
I am grieving the fact that
you guys are so caught up

29:10.574 --> 29:13.403
in playing Mr. Fucking Wizard
that you can't see

29:13.534 --> 29:15.884
what this place is
gonna become when you fail.

29:26.242 --> 29:29.898
So, what are
we supposed to do?

29:30.029 --> 29:31.726
What are we supposed to do?

29:31.857 --> 29:33.336
Just sit here
and not try to go home?

29:35.382 --> 29:36.949
Live in a place where
those things come to hunt us

29:37.079 --> 29:38.037
every single night?

29:38.167 --> 29:40.866
Oh, God, the fuck...

29:40.996 --> 29:42.737
Why not?

29:42.868 --> 29:45.044
At least here,
the monsters have the decency

29:45.174 --> 29:47.394
to show you what they are.

29:52.703 --> 29:57.534
I know you guys from town
look at Colony House

29:57.665 --> 30:02.148
and figure it's all just
drinking and fucking.

30:02.278 --> 30:05.107
But it was more than that.

30:05.238 --> 30:07.675
It was special.

30:07.806 --> 30:12.027
All those people from
all those different places,

30:12.158 --> 30:15.944
different lives,
everyone living together.

30:16.075 --> 30:18.077
For all the fear

30:18.207 --> 30:21.123
and all the
monsters-in-the-forest bullshit,

30:21.254 --> 30:23.212
there was something,

30:23.343 --> 30:25.258
there was a joy in that house.

30:28.827 --> 30:32.091
For a little while, anyways.

30:32.221 --> 30:35.703
And, like most things,
none of us appreciated it

30:35.834 --> 30:38.575
nearly as much as we should
have, and now it's fucking gone.

30:47.236 --> 30:48.368
I'm sorry.

30:50.283 --> 30:53.199
Yeah.

30:53.329 --> 30:54.635
Me, too.

31:04.297 --> 31:07.953
Look, I'm gonna put
my game face

31:08.083 --> 31:10.216
back on tomorrow,

31:10.346 --> 31:12.914
and we'll give
that tower a shot.

31:17.527 --> 31:21.053
But you have to be prepared for
the fallout if it doesn't work.

31:21.183 --> 31:23.229
And if it does work...

31:26.885 --> 31:29.496
I think you'll find there's
more you're gonna miss

31:29.626 --> 31:31.454
about this place
than you thought.

31:33.630 --> 31:40.463
♪

31:49.255 --> 31:50.952
That kinda day, huh?

31:54.564 --> 31:58.090
Just ironing out a few wrinkles,
that's all.

31:58.220 --> 31:59.091
Yeah.

31:59.221 --> 32:01.093
Where's Jade?

32:01.963 --> 32:06.620
He's, uh...
I don't know.

32:06.750 --> 32:08.187
Okay?

32:08.317 --> 32:10.189
Donna did a number
on the floor.

32:10.319 --> 32:12.278
Yeah.

32:12.408 --> 32:14.280
She knows how to wield an axe,
I'll give her that.

32:23.245 --> 32:26.248
Well, better
get back to it.

32:26.379 --> 32:29.512
So, we got that coil
for the CB that you needed,

32:29.643 --> 32:32.124
and we should have enough
wire stripped for the cord.

32:32.254 --> 32:34.082
That's great.

32:34.213 --> 32:35.388
Is it?

32:35.518 --> 32:38.434
Well, yeah.
I mean, look,

32:38.565 --> 32:40.915
I'm not gonna stand here and
pretend that it was a great day.

32:41.046 --> 32:44.571
These are setbacks,
nothing more.

32:44.701 --> 32:47.008
Look, you got what we
need for the radio,

32:47.139 --> 32:50.359
tower's almost finished,
and I'm gonna figure this out.

32:50.490 --> 32:52.187
How?

32:52.318 --> 32:54.755
Well, that
I don't know.

32:54.885 --> 32:58.106
But one thing you learn as an
engineer: there's always a way.

32:59.629 --> 33:01.240
We will figure this out.

33:32.271 --> 33:33.489
Hey.

33:36.623 --> 33:38.190
Hey.

33:38.320 --> 33:41.106
Are you okay?

33:43.543 --> 33:46.850
Eric was a friend.

33:47.677 --> 33:50.332
Oh God, I'm...
I'm sorry.

33:50.463 --> 33:52.160
I-I didn't know that
you guys were close.

33:54.989 --> 33:57.905
He had celiac disease,

33:58.036 --> 34:00.473
so he came to the clinic a lot.

34:00.603 --> 34:04.346
He was always bloated
and dehydrated.

34:04.477 --> 34:06.609
I kept telling him
to stop eating bread.

34:06.740 --> 34:10.483
But he always said things like,
"I'm already in shitsville,

34:10.613 --> 34:13.703
"now you want me
to give up carbs?"

34:13.834 --> 34:16.097
He just had this way
about him, you know?

34:16.228 --> 34:19.361
He was one of the people that,
when I first got here, he...

34:22.408 --> 34:23.452
just made it a lot easier.

34:26.368 --> 34:30.720
And now he's gone, so...

34:38.554 --> 34:40.556
Hey, Kristi...

34:40.687 --> 34:44.734
Look, I know you've had
a hard time lately,

34:44.865 --> 34:48.086
and that this tower
means a lot to everybody,

34:48.216 --> 34:50.479
and you feel like it's
your responsibility now--

34:50.610 --> 34:52.568
Kristi, I--

34:52.699 --> 34:56.311
But I just need you
to promise me, okay?

34:56.442 --> 35:00.707
If it falls apart,
if you fall apart,

35:00.837 --> 35:04.928
just promise me,
you'll come to me,

35:05.059 --> 35:07.235
you'll talk to me,

35:07.366 --> 35:09.107
you'll let me help.

35:12.545 --> 35:14.242
I promise you.

35:17.376 --> 35:20.944
Hey, I promise you.

35:21.075 --> 35:24.426
Come here.
Come on.

35:31.390 --> 35:32.304
It's okay.

35:35.568 --> 35:37.700
People just don't
understand what it's like.

35:37.831 --> 35:41.356
I mean, it's not like
you can take a nickel

35:41.487 --> 35:44.838
and suddenly make it
worth 10 cents!

35:45.795 --> 35:47.623
Aw, it doesn't matter.
You know why?

35:47.754 --> 35:52.672
Because Jade is a genius.
Jade'll figure it out. You...

35:52.802 --> 35:54.152
Let me tell you something,

35:54.282 --> 35:56.589
you have no idea
how much pressure that is,

35:56.719 --> 35:57.938
to be the one that everybody

35:58.068 --> 36:01.985
just assumes can fix a...

36:02.116 --> 36:03.683
an unfixable problem!

36:03.813 --> 36:07.556
Oh, and then...

36:07.687 --> 36:09.471
then, you've got
Mr. Tea Cups sauntering in

36:09.602 --> 36:14.433
with his big white horse
and his blue eyes and his,

36:14.563 --> 36:18.393
"Oh, don't smoke weed,
you degenerate."

36:20.569 --> 36:22.528
Fine, fine.
You know what? Fine.

36:22.658 --> 36:24.443
You think you can fix this?
Go ahead! Fix it!

36:24.573 --> 36:27.533
I'm just dying
to see how it's done. Ha!

36:29.491 --> 36:30.536
You so much complain!

36:30.666 --> 36:33.321
Complain, complain!

36:33.452 --> 36:35.062
Stop complain!

36:35.193 --> 36:37.412
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

36:37.543 --> 36:40.198
You need electric?

36:41.677 --> 36:42.504
Yeah.

36:55.604 --> 37:00.174
The problem is you can't
plug anything in.

37:00.305 --> 37:01.871
I mean, it'd be one thing
if it was just,

37:02.002 --> 37:05.571
you know, like a pan we
could throw on the stove.

37:05.701 --> 37:07.529
God knows,

37:07.660 --> 37:09.227
whatever's coming up through
those wires is still...

37:19.541 --> 37:20.890
Holy shit.
I know how to do it.

37:25.634 --> 37:26.722
Hello?

37:26.853 --> 37:30.378
We're down here!

37:32.641 --> 37:34.426
Hi.

37:34.556 --> 37:36.471
How did it go
with the tower?

37:36.602 --> 37:37.690
Uh, good.

37:37.820 --> 37:39.648
I think things are
really shaping up.

37:39.779 --> 37:42.738
You're a pretty bad liar.

37:42.869 --> 37:45.567
Thanks.
I'll add that to the list.

37:45.698 --> 37:48.353
It's gonna work.

37:52.661 --> 37:55.490
The tower,
it's gonna work.

37:55.621 --> 37:57.449
What's got you
feeling so optimistic?

37:57.579 --> 37:59.929
I don't know.

38:00.060 --> 38:02.628
I was just thinking about
something Ethan said.

38:02.758 --> 38:04.760
What was that?

38:04.891 --> 38:06.806
What if we were
supposed to come here?

38:06.936 --> 38:08.677
I don't know, it's weird, but...

38:08.808 --> 38:12.551
back home,
we never talked anymore.

38:12.681 --> 38:13.682
We just...

38:13.813 --> 38:16.555
And now,
we're together again,

38:16.685 --> 38:18.557
like, we're really together.

38:18.687 --> 38:21.734
And it's...

38:21.864 --> 38:23.692
it's like Fatima said to me
on my first night,

38:23.823 --> 38:26.521
"If you climb up high enough,

38:26.652 --> 38:28.393
even a nightmare can
look like a dream."

38:28.523 --> 38:30.351
Wise words.

38:33.528 --> 38:37.706
So, how about you forget about
your tower for a little while

38:37.837 --> 38:39.621
and come help us dig our hole?

38:41.667 --> 38:43.321
Deal.

Don't worry. We're safe.

39:38.637 --> 39:39.812
Is that...?

39:39.942 --> 39:41.640
Oh, yeah.

39:41.770 --> 39:45.557
I, uh...
finally managed to get one down,

39:45.687 --> 39:48.690
and, uh... this was inside.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.564
What does it say?

39:52.694 --> 39:54.522
1864.

39:55.654 --> 39:57.786
That's it.

39:57.917 --> 40:00.789
And, from what I could tell,

40:00.920 --> 40:02.748
every bottle up there seems
to have a slip of paper

40:02.878 --> 40:04.663
just like this.

40:05.925 --> 40:07.666
I think we should go back.

40:08.797 --> 40:11.887
What?

40:12.018 --> 40:13.759
The voice I heard,

40:13.889 --> 40:16.631
it was different this time.

40:16.762 --> 40:20.635
It was a woman and...

40:20.766 --> 40:22.550
and she was screaming.

40:22.681 --> 40:24.552
She said--

40:26.902 --> 40:29.818
She said that she was wrong,

40:29.949 --> 40:33.605
that we shouldn't have come,
that there are things out here

40:33.735 --> 40:35.824
that are worse
than the monsters.

40:35.955 --> 40:38.827
She kept saying...

40:38.958 --> 40:40.873
What?
She kept saying what?

40:41.003 --> 40:43.832
I don't know.

40:43.963 --> 40:47.270
It doesn't make any sense.

40:47.401 --> 40:48.750
She kept saying,

40:48.881 --> 40:50.665
"Tell Mr. Fish and Loaves

40:50.796 --> 40:52.450
that I was wrong."

40:54.843 --> 40:57.280
What?

41:02.938 --> 41:04.636
What is that?

41:04.766 --> 41:05.767
I don't know.

41:22.088 --> 41:23.655
What's happening?

41:23.785 --> 41:25.308
I don't know.

41:39.018 --> 41:43.022
There's drawings of scarecrows

41:43.152 --> 41:45.067
and bogeymen, giant spiders.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.505
This is definitely a quest.

41:52.771 --> 41:53.772
What is it?
