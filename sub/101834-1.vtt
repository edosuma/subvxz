WEBVTT

00:59.686 --> 01:01.219
Adam,
what are you doing?

01:03.488 --> 01:06.525
How am I supposed to know if my underpants
are clean if they're all the same color?

01:06.558 --> 01:09.494
Oh, gross. You could like,
I don't know,

01:09.528 --> 01:12.564
put your clean clothes in a different
spot than your dirty clothes.

01:12.597 --> 01:15.001
I don't know, actually fold them
and put them in drawers.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.469
How am I supposed to find
the time for that?

01:17.502 --> 01:22.307
Again, plenty of solutions,
you could play less video games.

01:22.340 --> 01:24.911
Ew, come on.

01:24.944 --> 01:27.747
You could watch less Netflix
or drink less.

01:27.780 --> 01:29.514
Or we could just have less sex.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.751
Oh, I could never do that
to you.

01:31.784 --> 01:34.754
I know how much you love having
me flop around on top of you.

01:34.787 --> 01:37.657
Geeze, Adam, why are you awake?
It's not even 1 PM yet.

01:37.690 --> 01:40.793
I have my Animal Behavior class
and then Bill's birthday thing.

01:40.827 --> 01:43.595
- Finally going to do that keg stand?
- Yeah, hopefully.

01:43.629 --> 01:47.667
You better do it soon. I'm pretty sure you
like, can't graduate if you don't do one.

01:47.700 --> 01:51.671
Yeah, one semester left.
It's going to be so weird.

01:51.704 --> 01:53.873
How are you supposed
to throw your cap?

01:53.906 --> 01:57.944
When I... I threw my cap up really
high when I graduated from high school

01:57.977 --> 02:01.781
and it came down right in the eye
of the girl sitting in front of me.

02:02.614 --> 02:07.285
Adam, you're supposed to throw it
like gently, directly in front of you.

02:07.319 --> 02:10.890
What? But that's so boring.
That's not how they do it in the movies.

02:13.659 --> 02:15.661
Do you have to go to class?

02:16.629 --> 02:19.665
You know how hard it is for me to
sleep when you're not snuggling me.

02:19.699 --> 02:22.635
Oh, I could maybe be coaxed
into a dalliance.

02:22.668 --> 02:24.771
What's a dalliance?

02:24.804 --> 02:27.073
Well, in this context,
it's morning sex.

02:27.106 --> 02:28.841
Maybe afternoon sex.

02:28.875 --> 02:30.743
Ah, ha! It is afternoon.

02:30.777 --> 02:32.410
Then night sex?

02:32.444 --> 02:34.747
Boo, that's just
the regular kind.

02:35.882 --> 02:41.353
- Does that mean you're going to Bill's birthday thing?
- I can't.

02:41.386 --> 02:45.323
I have to do stuff
with my brother's wedding.

02:45.357 --> 02:48.460
Oh, shit, that's right,
your brother's getting married.

02:48.493 --> 02:51.063
- Put that in my planner.
- You don't own a planner.

02:51.097 --> 02:53.498
Shit, that's right,
I gotta get a planner.

02:53.532 --> 02:57.103
Adam, come on, there's like
a semester left of school.

02:57.136 --> 02:58.436
That's true.

03:00.472 --> 03:01.506
Come on.

03:03.943 --> 03:06.779
- Come back to bed?
- And then I'll never get to class.

03:08.047 --> 03:09.715
How many absences do you have?

03:09.749 --> 03:11.449
None, it's a really
interesting class.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.451
Come back to bed.

03:15.788 --> 03:18.991
- Okay, but we better have sex.
- Of course.

03:22.728 --> 03:23.896
Eventually.

03:29.534 --> 03:33.105
Welcome to
Zoology 313, Animal Behavior.

03:33.139 --> 03:36.008
This semester we're gonna be taking
a look at the essential natures

03:36.042 --> 03:38.778
and defining activities
of sexual organisms.

03:38.811 --> 03:43.950
A significant portion of the
life of living things is directly

03:43.983 --> 03:46.052
or indirectly related
to reproduction.

03:46.085 --> 03:48.721
Now, just how significant
is that portion?

03:48.754 --> 03:50.823
Well, we endeavor to
answer that question.

04:00.498 --> 04:04.036
Happy birthday, motherfucker.
Grow up and drink a beer.

04:04.070 --> 04:06.973
Beer. It's just what I wanted.

04:08.908 --> 04:10.643
Dude, this place is
disgusting.

04:11.744 --> 04:12.845
Yeah, I was gonna clean up.

04:12.879 --> 04:14.013
When?

04:14.046 --> 04:15.380
It's my birthday.

04:16.849 --> 04:20.686
This banana peel is from two months
ago, I swear to God.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.622
Who am I trying to impress though?
You're never around.

04:23.656 --> 04:26.558
- Always at Lauren's place.
- You didn't even lock the door.

04:26.591 --> 04:29.095
- What have I got to steal?
- What about my stuff?

04:29.128 --> 04:31.697
No, that's the whole
strategy, man.

04:31.731 --> 04:35.101
Anyone who comes in here
thinks it's already been,

04:35.134 --> 04:38.603
what, ransacked, pillaged,
rifled through...

04:38.638 --> 04:41.641
Rooted around in? Wherein?

04:41.674 --> 04:43.475
Rooted around as?

04:43.508 --> 04:45.443
Rooted around within.

04:45.477 --> 04:48.915
One stop root shop,
get your rudest rutabagas.

04:48.948 --> 04:51.784
Just get in there
and root around.

04:51.817 --> 04:55.620
If I didn't need this to ease the pain
in my testicles, I'd throw it at you.

05:03.195 --> 05:06.032
Kalsbeek, what's the plan, man?
Kegger at your place?

05:06.065 --> 05:10.202
No, I threw the Halloween party. And
I'm throwing the end of the year party.

05:10.236 --> 05:12.470
It's a superhero party,
spoiler alert.

05:13.005 --> 05:15.041
Just bring the keg here,
we'll do it here.

05:15.074 --> 05:17.777
No, I'm not inviting
anyone to this zoo.

05:17.810 --> 05:20.646
This is all Bill's shit. Bill,
can you clean this up before the party?

05:20.680 --> 05:22.949
- I'm not doing shit on my birthday.
- Guys, gentlemen,

05:22.982 --> 05:25.184
I have it all figured out, all right?
We're going to the bar.

05:25.217 --> 05:28.553
- But I was gonna do a keg stand.
- It'll have to wait.

05:28.586 --> 05:30.622
- Oh!
- I made shirts.

05:33.558 --> 05:37.830
- Why?
- It's a bar crawl. Spoiler alert.

05:39.165 --> 05:40.800
I don't know,
what do you think, Bill?

05:41.701 --> 05:42.868
I'm down.

05:45.304 --> 05:46.706
Not wearing this shirt.

06:41.761 --> 06:42.895
Red pants.

06:44.296 --> 06:47.933
Are you in my, uh,
my zoology class?

06:48.768 --> 06:51.670
Do you want to go
to the bathroom?

06:51.704 --> 06:53.072
With you?

06:53.105 --> 06:54.707
No, I mean, well, like...

06:54.740 --> 06:56.108
No, I don't have to pee.

06:56.142 --> 07:00.279
Okay, great, because
you're very attractive

07:00.312 --> 07:05.251
and... and it's my buddy Bill's
birthday,

07:05.284 --> 07:09.055
he's that one over there, and I was
wondering what you thought of him.

07:10.689 --> 07:15.661
So far, all I know is that
he is male

07:15.694 --> 07:19.231
and was born
on this day so many years ago.

07:19.265 --> 07:20.633
Probably 21.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.268
- Very close, 22.
- Mm.

07:25.171 --> 07:27.206
So, what's he like?

07:28.274 --> 07:33.646
Well, Bill is, he's a sort of...

07:35.981 --> 07:39.285
- Well, let's just get him over here. Bill, Bill.
- Oh.

07:39.318 --> 07:40.753
Wow.

07:40.786 --> 07:45.091
Yeah, that's not, this isn't really
the way that people do this, is it?

07:45.124 --> 07:48.027
- Certainly a unique approach.
- Right?

07:48.060 --> 07:50.129
Hey, what's going on?

07:50.162 --> 07:52.131
Why are we hanging out
near the bathrooms?

07:52.164 --> 07:56.202
Unknown. I'm trying to
sell you to this young lady here.

08:00.072 --> 08:01.674
How much am I going for?

08:02.842 --> 08:04.243
I'm not sure yet.

08:04.276 --> 08:07.012
How should we determine value?

08:08.080 --> 08:09.181
Slapface?

08:10.116 --> 08:11.450
What's slapface?

08:11.484 --> 08:14.653
Bill, I don't think that slapface
is a public venue sort of thing.

08:14.687 --> 08:15.788
Too late.

08:21.227 --> 08:22.595
I'm gonna go get another drink.

08:22.628 --> 08:26.799
Yeah, hit me a little bit,
I want to feel it, man. Come on, come on.

08:30.136 --> 08:32.872
- All right, get...
- It's my birthday, dude!

08:33.906 --> 08:39.979
Aye, you know, I've always
wanted to have a bar fight.

08:40.012 --> 08:44.984
Yeah. We'd do well to find
someone else to fight with though.

08:45.951 --> 08:49.321
Yeah, I think we'd be
really good at it.

08:49.355 --> 08:51.991
- We've practiced enough on each other.
- Yeah.

08:56.228 --> 08:57.730
Where's Kalsbeek?

08:59.064 --> 09:01.200
He was doing pretty well
with those girls in there.

09:01.233 --> 09:02.868
He probably went home with 'em.

09:05.371 --> 09:06.438
Which one?

09:08.474 --> 09:11.177
Probably all of 'em,
knowing Kalsbeek.

09:12.211 --> 09:15.714
- What's with that?
- I don't know.

09:17.416 --> 09:19.852
Dude chafes me enough.

09:19.885 --> 09:22.755
I'd hate to know what he'd do
to someone's vagina.

09:25.491 --> 09:27.059
Why do we hang out with him?

09:32.998 --> 09:37.937
I hang out with him because
you're never around and he is.

09:39.805 --> 09:41.173
I'm sorry, buddy.

09:43.842 --> 09:49.248
It's cool, but...
I miss you, man.

09:52.251 --> 09:56.922
I mean, I get it, Lauren's
slightly more attractive than I am.

09:56.956 --> 09:59.425
Attractive in a different way,
let's say.

10:02.895 --> 10:06.098
You know, we can all hang out
together sometime.

10:08.334 --> 10:09.501
I like Lauren.

10:11.503 --> 10:14.473
Yeah. Maybe. Why not?

10:16.809 --> 10:21.814
We could watch a movie,
play some video games,

10:21.847 --> 10:24.917
some double penetration.

10:28.854 --> 10:29.855
Ow!

10:35.894 --> 10:40.299
People usually go to more than one
bar in a bar crawl, don't they?

10:40.332 --> 10:42.968
Yeah.

11:01.553 --> 11:03.122
I'm leaving your mother.

11:05.024 --> 11:09.228
First of all, no, you're not.
Second of all, no, you're not.

11:09.261 --> 11:11.597
Whenever I leave the house
for any reason whatsoever,

11:11.631 --> 11:12.564
your mother wants to know
where I'm going.

11:12.598 --> 11:14.933
"Why are you leaving?
Where are you going?

11:14.967 --> 11:16.168
How long are you
gonna be gone for?"

11:16.201 --> 11:19.505
And then once I'm gone,
she's constantly checking up on me.

11:19.538 --> 11:22.174
She probably texted me six times
since I got into town.

11:22.207 --> 11:25.110
Maybe she just loves
and misses you.

11:26.045 --> 11:29.148
Don't be so naive, Adam.
It's so she can crush my spirit.

11:29.181 --> 11:32.151
- Why are you here anyway?
- To see you kids.

11:32.184 --> 11:35.454
Not that your, you know, doctoral student
sister can give me the time of day.

11:36.221 --> 11:38.457
You drove all the way here
just to see us?

11:38.490 --> 11:40.526
Hey, it's only an hour.

11:40.559 --> 11:44.163
And now that I'm here, I'll probably try
to, you know, play nine holes with Fred.

11:44.196 --> 11:45.397
That sounds more probable.

11:45.431 --> 11:49.134
To be honest, any excuse to get
out of the house on a weekend.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.236
Your mother is a slave driver.

11:51.270 --> 11:55.107
It's like, "Scott, can you get the groceries?
Scott, can you kill that spider?

11:55.140 --> 11:57.976
Scott, have you fixed
the toilet yet?"

11:59.111 --> 12:01.347
Dad, I think you're
overreacting again.

12:02.047 --> 12:05.984
Okay, I think maybe I should have never
gotten married in the first place.

12:06.018 --> 12:08.620
- Dad!
- No, no, I mean, you kids are great.

12:08.655 --> 12:10.222
I'm glad we cranked
you guys out,

12:10.255 --> 12:13.559
but I just think once the kids are out
of the house, all bets should be off.

12:13.592 --> 12:16.095
Remind me to put that
in my wedding vows.

12:16.128 --> 12:18.997
No. You and Lauren aren't thinking
about getting married, are you?

12:19.998 --> 12:24.203
I was joking.
But I mean, yeah, maybe.

12:24.236 --> 12:26.605
It's been three years.
I've definitely thought about it.

12:26.639 --> 12:28.974
Yeah, think about it.
I mean, don't stop thinking about it.

12:29.007 --> 12:32.244
Keep thinking about it.
You know, just piss or get off the pot,

12:32.277 --> 12:33.445
that's what I always say.

12:34.179 --> 12:35.347
I've never heard you say that.

12:35.381 --> 12:36.348
Speaking of pot...

12:36.382 --> 12:37.483
Oh, God!

12:37.516 --> 12:39.084
You know, I can't get
the good stuff out in the 'burbs

12:39.118 --> 12:41.387
and I need it
to deal with your mother.

12:41.420 --> 12:43.355
Dad, I think you have a problem.

12:44.123 --> 12:46.392
Do this
or I'm leaving your mother.

12:46.425 --> 12:47.593
And then we become roommates.

12:47.627 --> 12:49.228
You're evil, you know that.

12:49.962 --> 12:54.433
Come to the dark side
and bring the reefer.

12:54.466 --> 12:59.037
Luke, Luke,
I'll leave your mother.

12:59.071 --> 13:00.172
All right, all right.

13:00.205 --> 13:02.074
Perfect, call you after golf.

13:02.107 --> 13:03.475
There we go.

13:04.410 --> 13:05.511
Oh, did you order for me?

13:05.544 --> 13:06.612
No, did you want something?

13:08.313 --> 13:10.683
- I can get you something.
- No, no. No, that's fine.

13:10.717 --> 13:15.087
All right, see you later,
wink, wink.

13:15.120 --> 13:16.622
I'm gonna need a ton
of mayonnaise.

13:21.193 --> 13:23.630
Holy... God! You startled me.

13:23.663 --> 13:25.230
I can see that, sorry.

13:26.766 --> 13:30.002
You brought me a flower?
That's so sweet.

13:31.437 --> 13:32.404
Mwah.

13:42.347 --> 13:44.283
Lauren, do you believe
in soul mates?

13:44.316 --> 13:46.985
It's kind of a loaded term.

13:48.187 --> 13:51.123
I know but it's important.

13:51.156 --> 13:53.625
Um...

13:53.660 --> 13:55.160
Depends on what you mean
by soul mates.

13:55.194 --> 13:58.698
To me soul mates creates this picture
of divinity, which is, I don't know.

14:01.133 --> 14:03.235
Why, do you believe
in soul mates?

14:05.404 --> 14:09.374
People who believe in soul mates are like people
who believe in <i>Bigfoo</i> and <i>Ancient Aliens</i>,

14:09.408 --> 14:12.044
people that watch
the History Channel.

14:14.213 --> 14:16.315
Yeah, but it doesn't
have to be...

14:16.348 --> 14:19.686
like it could be scientific
or mathematical.

14:20.820 --> 14:23.589
So, you do then believe
in soul mates?

14:23.622 --> 14:27.660
No, not necessarily
soul mates, that's a...

14:27.694 --> 14:28.728
Loaded term?

14:28.761 --> 14:30.295
Yes, a loaded term, yes.

14:30.329 --> 14:35.501
But I do believe in
like optimal mates.

14:35.534 --> 14:40.439
Like everyone has to have someone that
they would be most happy with, right?

14:40.472 --> 14:43.743
Like just mathematically,
it's... it's inevitable.

14:43.776 --> 14:46.646
Okay, sounds like
soul mates to me.

14:46.679 --> 14:49.081
Yeah, but it's... but...
but it's not the same thing.

14:51.583 --> 14:53.318
Do you think
I'm your optimal mate?

14:55.487 --> 14:58.357
Yeah. I think so, yeah.

15:00.760 --> 15:01.761
Why are you bringing this up?

15:02.862 --> 15:04.196
No reason.

15:05.163 --> 15:06.298
Are you proposing to me?

15:06.733 --> 15:10.235
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- Good.

15:12.204 --> 15:13.438
- But...
- But what?

15:15.374 --> 15:17.042
I don't know, Lauren, we're...

15:18.310 --> 15:23.248
we're about to graduate and we've
been dating a very long time

15:23.282 --> 15:25.350
and things are going to change
after college.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.519
Why do they have to change
after college?

15:27.553 --> 15:29.354
You know what I mean.

15:29.388 --> 15:31.156
Adam.

15:32.391 --> 15:33.693
How many people
have you slept with?

15:36.428 --> 15:38.330
Come on, how many? Tell me.

15:39.598 --> 15:41.466
Three. You know that.

15:42.501 --> 15:43.602
And is that all right with you?

15:45.370 --> 15:48.574
Well, yeah, of course.
I mean, you're... you're the only...

15:48.607 --> 15:50.409
Adam, don't.
Come on, it's not the point.

15:50.442 --> 15:54.847
Just wouldn't you like to get a little more
experience before you commit to someone forever?

15:59.686 --> 16:03.422
Are you... are you saying
you want to break up?

16:03.455 --> 16:06.391
No. Baby, no, no.

16:06.425 --> 16:11.129
But maybe we should take
like a temporary break

16:11.163 --> 16:13.633
to see what else is out there.

16:14.366 --> 16:15.902
It sounds like
you want to break up.

16:15.935 --> 16:20.138
No. No, it would just,
to get more experience.

16:21.206 --> 16:22.541
To get it all out of our system.

16:24.476 --> 16:30.683
So, you're suggesting
a sex break?

16:30.717 --> 16:32.685
Exactly. Just...

16:35.487 --> 16:38.590
I don't know, to get a little
more experience, to get...

16:38.624 --> 16:42.327
And then, hey, if I'm your optimal mate,
it should work out perfectly, right?

16:44.864 --> 16:46.298
I don't hate it.

16:46.331 --> 16:48.635
And spring break
is coming up.

16:48.668 --> 16:49.902
Oh, we were gonna
go to New Orleans.

16:49.936 --> 16:51.503
Oh, come on,
you go to New Orleans.

16:51.536 --> 16:53.205
I'll go to Cabo with Kim.
A bunch of my friends are...

16:53.238 --> 16:55.340
Fuck that, I'm gonna go
to Panama Beach with Bill.

16:55.374 --> 16:57.242
Okay, that's excellent.

17:00.747 --> 17:02.581
I am so happy that
you are into this.

17:03.448 --> 17:05.818
Of course,
it's a really good idea.

17:19.766 --> 17:21.566
This is so shady.

17:21.600 --> 17:23.036
Adam, come on.

17:23.069 --> 17:26.538
I'm a middle-aged white man reading
political cartoons in a newspaper.

17:26.571 --> 17:29.608
I don't think I'm the primary target
for the local law enforcement.

17:29.642 --> 17:30.810
Just be cool.

17:47.026 --> 17:49.996
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You didn't wrap it up in anything?

17:50.029 --> 17:56.234
Actually, Sir, there's
an interesting article on drug deals

17:56.268 --> 17:58.236
in this section of my newspaper.

17:59.538 --> 18:00.572
Put it in there.

18:10.750 --> 18:13.886
It's your mother. Gotta figure
out a way to block her number.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.555
Hey, you talk to her.
I'm gonna roll a doobie for the road.

18:18.590 --> 18:20.827
Doobie.

18:21.728 --> 18:23.261
Hey, Mom, how's it going?

18:23.295 --> 18:25.765
<i>Adam. It's so good
to hear your voice.</i>

18:25.798 --> 18:27.633
Yeah, yours, too.
How's it going?

18:27.667 --> 18:31.303
<i>Oh, just fine, fine.
How are you, my love?</i>

18:31.336 --> 18:33.639
Good actually, really good.

18:33.673 --> 18:36.374
- <i>Did you propose to Lauren?</i>
- What?

18:36.408 --> 18:39.011
Your father said you and Lauren
might be getting married.

18:39.045 --> 18:40.880
No, no, that's not what...

18:40.913 --> 18:42.380
<i>You're not breaking up, are you?</i>

18:42.414 --> 18:43.950
No, Mom. No, we're not.

18:43.983 --> 18:46.886
- <i>Was she sleeping around?</i>
- No! God, Mom.

18:46.919 --> 18:50.923
<i>I had a feeling. She was always so
eager to show off those legs of hers.</i>

18:50.957 --> 18:52.290
Mom, stop.

18:52.324 --> 18:56.829
Everything's fine. Just... just...
just don't worry about it, okay?

18:56.863 --> 18:58.430
We're... we're gonna be fine.

18:59.331 --> 19:01.901
- Now, talk to Dad.
- Okay, bye.

19:05.604 --> 19:06.739
Okay, bye.

19:08.406 --> 19:09.942
Aren't you forgetting something?

19:10.877 --> 19:12.577
No, I said bye.

19:13.746 --> 19:15.748
You owe me for the, uh...

19:16.916 --> 19:18.985
- For the drugs?
- Yeah.

19:20.552 --> 19:22.722
I think I pay for your college,
don't I?

19:23.622 --> 19:25.725
Well, I think we're square then.

19:27.126 --> 19:28.527
Good, bye.

19:29.796 --> 19:31.764
Wait a couple minutes
before you leave.

19:58.825 --> 20:01.794
- Hey, you're cute.
- Thanks.

20:20.445 --> 20:24.416
- What?
- Can I buy you a drink?

20:24.449 --> 20:28.020
- Sure.
- Awesome.

20:28.620 --> 20:31.724
- What do you want?
- What?

20:31.757 --> 20:35.493
What do you want to drink?
Like a shot?

20:35.527 --> 20:37.596
Uh, yeah, I guess.

20:38.865 --> 20:40.432
What kind of shot do you want?

20:54.146 --> 20:55.982
Getting a bartender is like...

20:56.983 --> 21:00.019
Hey, can I get two vodkas,
please?

21:09.662 --> 21:11.931
Hey, shots, shots are here.

21:11.964 --> 21:15.968
So, I... so, I'm in this
committed relationship, right,

21:16.002 --> 21:18.905
but we're on a break for spring
break, we're on a spring break!

21:21.641 --> 21:22.742
What?

21:23.876 --> 21:25.410
$12?

21:27.046 --> 21:29.181
Now this one's
important. This will be on the next test.

21:29.215 --> 21:30.983
Operational sex ratio.

21:32.785 --> 21:37.489
Now this is important because it defines a great
deal of mating behaviors within a species.

21:37.990 --> 21:40.492
It is the proportion
of willing fertile males

21:40.525 --> 21:43.229
versus the proportion
of willing fertile females.

21:43.262 --> 21:47.633
In spiders, for instance, the proportion
of able males is disproportionately high

21:47.667 --> 21:49.669
compared to the amount of
willing females.

21:49.702 --> 21:51.938
You might call it
a sausage fest.

21:53.673 --> 21:58.077
For this reason, male spiders have to work
very hard to persuade a female partner,

21:58.110 --> 22:01.113
while females will have many
suitors with minimal effort.

22:04.817 --> 22:09.655
In many ways, this is also why
male spiders get eaten post-coitus.

22:26.706 --> 22:28.473
Can I get another one of those?

22:30.176 --> 22:33.646
Hey, take it easy. You okay?

22:33.679 --> 22:36.749
It just
went down the wrong tube.

22:36.782 --> 22:40.286
I assumed you always
breathe in your alcohol.

22:40.319 --> 22:42.154
Well, maybe it goes
to the brain faster.

22:42.188 --> 22:45.224
Maybe you're just terrible
at drinking.

22:45.257 --> 22:48.094
Well, there's plenty of time
for more practice.

22:50.730 --> 22:53.766
Only if you provide a poncho
to every person in the bar.

22:57.670 --> 22:58.637
Red pants?

22:59.905 --> 23:01.674
- What was your name again?
- Darbee.

23:01.707 --> 23:03.843
Oh, exotic.

23:03.876 --> 23:05.244
- What was yours?
- Adam.

23:05.277 --> 23:07.947
Oh, familiar.

23:07.980 --> 23:10.883
Guilty.

23:14.186 --> 23:17.857
So, do you wanna stick around here or did
you want to move closer to the bathroom?

23:17.890 --> 23:20.126
No, this is fine.

23:27.233 --> 23:32.204
And now, sexual pleasure
manifests itself rarely amongst animals.

23:32.238 --> 23:34.774
It's not something that
is ubiquitous, okay?

23:34.807 --> 23:39.745
But it does have, uh, certain adaptive elements
and extra social uses in some animals.

23:40.780 --> 23:43.049
Bonobos, for instance,
one of our closest relatives,

23:43.082 --> 23:45.985
actually rub their genitals
together with each other

23:46.018 --> 23:48.921
to alleviate social tension
and aggression.

23:48.954 --> 23:54.326
So males and females, females and females,
males and males, the sex doesn't matter,

23:54.360 --> 23:58.664
which is somewhat amazing considering
that other species of baboons actually

23:58.697 --> 24:02.101
rip the genitals off
of competing males.

24:03.769 --> 24:05.871
So if you think bonobos
are weird,

24:05.905 --> 24:08.808
I don't know, I think the whole
thing's actually pretty neat to me.

24:08.841 --> 24:12.645
Not... like the bonobos,
not the... you know, like,

24:12.678 --> 24:14.246
I don't want to be ripped,
I want to be rubbed.

24:14.280 --> 24:21.020
Not... not that like... not because...
you know... you know...

24:21.053 --> 24:23.055
You know...

24:44.810 --> 24:46.946
- All right, all right, I gotta stop.
- What?

24:48.414 --> 24:51.884
- I'm not wearing protection.
- What?

24:54.120 --> 24:57.756
Did it... did I go inside you?

24:57.790 --> 24:59.959
How is that acceptable phrasing?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.329
- I don't think so.
- You don't think so?

25:03.362 --> 25:05.164
I think I blacked out.

25:05.197 --> 25:07.066
When?

25:08.767 --> 25:15.141
Sometime between the time that I met you and
when I found myself inside of you just now.

25:15.174 --> 25:17.276
For crying out loud.

25:17.309 --> 25:20.846
But that's, but okay, well,
don't take that personally.

25:20.880 --> 25:22.348
It's not a reflection of
how I feel about you.

25:22.381 --> 25:24.116
No, this was stupid.

25:25.284 --> 25:26.952
Look, I had a good time.

25:26.986 --> 25:29.088
How would you know?

25:30.789 --> 25:32.992
Well, no. That's... that's...
it's a good point.

25:33.025 --> 25:36.061
I took advantage of you,
it was stupid to do that.

25:36.095 --> 25:38.430
You took advantage of me?

25:38.464 --> 25:40.065
- Yes, because of...
- I was into it.

25:40.099 --> 25:44.870
No, no, no, because of the whole heartbreak
thing going on with your girlfriend.

25:44.904 --> 25:48.874
- Oh, I told you about that?
- Only about 1,000 times.

25:48.908 --> 25:51.343
That's, that's embarrassing.

25:51.377 --> 25:54.280
It's stupid,
for your information,

25:54.313 --> 25:56.916
to stress out about that
kind of stuff, you know?

25:56.949 --> 26:00.152
I just wanted you to relax,
you know.

26:03.956 --> 26:10.462
Goodbye. This was... goodbye.

26:10.496 --> 26:13.098
Wait, wait, no, stop.
What are you talking about?

26:13.132 --> 26:15.267
What stuff
am I stressing out about?

26:15.301 --> 26:19.505
It's, whatever, it's like
the institutions, you know?

26:19.538 --> 26:20.906
It's marriage.

26:20.940 --> 26:22.174
Oh, God!

26:22.208 --> 26:24.310
See, there you go,
that's what I'm talking about.

26:24.343 --> 26:27.913
I don't understand why people
stress out about these things.

26:27.947 --> 26:31.050
It's supposed to be about choice,
it's supposed to make you happy.

26:31.083 --> 26:33.319
So, why do it
if it doesn't make you happy

26:33.352 --> 26:37.189
or if you've gotta see other
people, for crying out loud?

26:37.223 --> 26:38.924
Well, that's not...
that's not the whole.

26:38.958 --> 26:41.293
No, I get that it's supposed
to be about more than that.

26:41.327 --> 26:44.930
That's what it's supposed
to be about... or whatever.

26:44.964 --> 26:49.134
But institutions, they make
people crazy and for what?

26:51.837 --> 26:54.940
Well, you buy into it just
as much as anyone else.

26:54.974 --> 26:56.175
No, I don't.

26:56.208 --> 26:59.411
- Well, you go to school here, don't you?
- No, I don't.

26:59.445 --> 27:03.549
But we were talking about
science.

27:03.582 --> 27:07.286
Just because I don't go to school
here, that makes me an idiot?

27:07.319 --> 27:10.789
Well, no, I mean,
not necessarily.

27:10.823 --> 27:12.358
See, here's the thing.

27:12.391 --> 27:15.361
You don't get any value
out of your degree.

27:15.394 --> 27:22.001
You get value out of knowledge, so I
read a lot and I sit in on some classes.

27:28.974 --> 27:30.442
I don't know where I am.

27:31.577 --> 27:33.279
Can I stay here tonight?

27:34.146 --> 27:37.516
Yes, yes, please. Careful.

27:47.694 --> 27:51.864
What were you... what was it we were
talking about before about duck vaginas?

27:51.897 --> 27:55.301
That makes sense,
I do that a lot.

27:57.269 --> 28:01.540
It's really interesting, how do
you remember that but I don't?

28:01.573 --> 28:05.010
- It was a weird conversation.
- Yeah.

28:05.444 --> 28:07.446
Was I talking about
the different pathways?

28:08.113 --> 28:10.482
Yeah, yes,
it's something about that.

28:10.516 --> 28:16.121
Okay, so ducks' vaginas have evolved
so that they have different pathways,

28:16.155 --> 28:21.060
so that they can...
they can, um,

28:21.093 --> 28:23.896
divert male duck penises

28:23.929 --> 28:25.998
that they don't want
inside of their vaginas.

28:26.031 --> 28:29.535
That way they are in charge
of who gets them pregnant.

28:29.568 --> 28:36.075
Because male ducks are all
rapey, like all the time.

28:36.942 --> 28:39.345
Why would we be talking
about that?

28:41.681 --> 28:43.082
I like ducks.

28:46.118 --> 28:47.886
Okay.

29:39.304 --> 29:41.306
- Dude, what are you doing?
- I'm pooping.

29:41.340 --> 29:43.509
I can see that.
Why are your feet on the stool?

29:43.542 --> 29:46.412
Oh, I like to get my knees up
above my pelvis.

29:46.445 --> 29:49.047
It opens up the anus
or something, you know?

29:49.081 --> 29:51.083
People have been doing this
for thousands of years.

29:51.116 --> 29:52.418
It really helps.

29:52.451 --> 29:54.420
Is that why the stool's
in there?

29:54.453 --> 29:57.289
- Yeah, why else would it be?
- Well, hurry up.

29:59.391 --> 30:00.626
Stool!

30:02.327 --> 30:07.433
<i>♪ What is it good for?
Absolute pooping! ♪</i>

30:11.236 --> 30:13.572
Hey, Bill, guess what?

30:13.605 --> 30:15.441
You had sex?

30:15.474 --> 30:17.342
No.

30:17.376 --> 30:19.077
What,
did you not have sex?

30:19.111 --> 30:20.680
No, yeah, but you said it.

30:22.314 --> 30:24.183
Was that it? I saw her
when she left this morning.

30:24.216 --> 30:26.018
- I wanted to say it.
- Say what?

30:26.051 --> 30:28.487
- That I had sex.
- There you go, you said it.

30:28.520 --> 30:29.689
Did you bag it?

30:32.157 --> 30:35.527
Oh, dude, you're reckless.
Did you goo inside her?

30:35.561 --> 30:37.730
Unknown. It's probably fine.

30:37.764 --> 30:39.565
She's probably on the pill.

30:39.598 --> 30:43.235
You better hope so.
You don't want kids yet, buddy.

30:43.268 --> 30:47.105
Yeah,
that would be the worst.

30:53.212 --> 30:55.013
Ow, what the fuck?

30:56.783 --> 30:58.517
What the fuck?

31:02.154 --> 31:04.456
Bill, you ever get a
burning sensation when you pee?

31:08.460 --> 31:10.195
Yeah, but I was 13.

31:12.264 --> 31:14.166
I put my dick
in a lot of weird places.

31:14.199 --> 31:15.501
What the fuck
do you want from me?

31:16.502 --> 31:17.770
Bill, I have something
to tell you.

31:18.771 --> 31:20.640
You've become a vegetarian.

31:20.673 --> 31:22.274
One more guess.

31:22.307 --> 31:24.476
- It burns when you pee.
- That's the one.

31:24.510 --> 31:26.445
What did you do with yours,
what was that?

31:27.346 --> 31:30.148
That's just a urinary
tract infection.

31:30.182 --> 31:31.617
They gave me antibiotics.

31:31.651 --> 31:34.319
But there's this red spot here,
look at this.

31:34.353 --> 31:35.822
I think I'll pass.

31:35.855 --> 31:37.289
Look it up on your computer.

31:39.826 --> 31:41.326
Put some pants on?

31:43.595 --> 31:44.764
Quid pro quo.

31:50.469 --> 31:53.640
Ew.
Thank you, Google Image search.

31:55.708 --> 31:56.809
What do we got?

31:56.843 --> 32:02.180
- Is this what it looks like?
- Ew, ew, ew. No. God no!

32:02.214 --> 32:06.518
Well, it's not third stage syphilis, but
we probably shouldn't rule out first stage.

32:06.552 --> 32:08.520
What? No.

32:08.554 --> 32:09.656
You don't think...

32:12.558 --> 32:13.660
Fuck!

32:17.764 --> 32:19.431
What do you want, Adam?

32:19.464 --> 32:22.334
I know you're busy and you're trying to
keep this place professional or whatever.

32:22.367 --> 32:26.171
Okay, if this is about Vicodin, you know
I'm only gonna give you placebos again.

32:26.204 --> 32:27.506
Again?

32:27.539 --> 32:29.541
Goddamn it, you're ruining
my placebo effect.

32:29.575 --> 32:31.744
Excellent.
Now if you would kindly leave.

32:31.778 --> 32:34.546
No, Meghan, I... I need you.
I need to see a doctor.

32:34.580 --> 32:36.281
Well, then see a doctor.

32:36.315 --> 32:37.650
I'm not out of
my fellowship yet.

32:37.684 --> 32:39.351
You're close enough.

32:39.384 --> 32:43.322
And I can't have this go through insurance
because I can't have Mom and Dad finding out.

32:43.355 --> 32:46.124
That sounds like something I am
going to hold over your head.

32:46.158 --> 32:49.528
Yes, that is certainly something to
consider but I wish that you wouldn't.

32:49.561 --> 32:51.898
So it must be pretty bad.

32:51.931 --> 32:54.867
Actually,
I need your opinion on it.

32:58.905 --> 33:01.841
Gross, Adam, no.
Oh, my God! No.

33:01.874 --> 33:04.343
- God!
- Come on, Meghan, I'm in need.

33:04.376 --> 33:05.645
How did this even happen?

33:05.678 --> 33:07.179
Did you cheat on Lauren,
you slut?

33:07.212 --> 33:11.316
We just took a break and that is also
something you cannot tell Mom and Dad.

33:11.350 --> 33:12.752
I do not wanna have
that conversation.

33:12.785 --> 33:15.220
Well, I much prefer it to the
conversation we're having right now.

33:15.253 --> 33:16.789
Come on, Meghan.

33:23.930 --> 33:25.197
You have to give me back
my cardigan.

33:25.230 --> 33:28.300
I only have that because I
still think you have my hoodie.

33:28.333 --> 33:30.168
Well, you're never getting
that back now.

33:30.202 --> 33:31.169
I knew you had it.

33:31.203 --> 33:32.504
It looks better on me.

33:32.537 --> 33:35.407
- Oh, but... but not the cardigan.
- It's a women's cardigan.

33:35.440 --> 33:36.776
Irrelevant.

33:37.442 --> 33:40.680
- Okay, fine, no deal.
- No, no, please, Meghan.

33:40.713 --> 33:42.247
You've got a deal.

33:43.783 --> 33:47.486
Adam, I don't wanna do this and please
could you just find somebody else...

33:47.519 --> 33:49.454
Just look at my penis.

33:50.823 --> 33:52.725
Now what
Fisher is really talking about here

33:52.759 --> 33:56.763
is the concept that biologists
call the costs of reproduction.

33:56.796 --> 34:00.900
Now reproductive fitness, that's the driving
force behind all animal behavior, right?

34:00.933 --> 34:05.638
But there are sometimes when there can be
consequences or drawbacks from reproduction

34:05.672 --> 34:07.840
that can be unwanted.

34:07.874 --> 34:11.911
Fisher, eventually, included this in his
fundamental theorem of natural selection,

34:11.944 --> 34:14.546
which was then folded
into the Price equation.

34:14.579 --> 34:16.849
But my question for you all
right now is,

34:16.883 --> 34:20.185
what are some of the risks of
reproduction of sexual organisms?

34:21.319 --> 34:22.354
I don't know.

34:54.053 --> 34:55.121
What are you doing here?

34:56.621 --> 34:58.791
You've built a fort in the
middle of the living room.

35:00.292 --> 35:01.761
It's my fortress
of fortitude.

35:03.295 --> 35:06.498
And it seems to have
swallowed the television set.

35:06.966 --> 35:08.533
<i>Jurassic Park</i> was on.

35:11.536 --> 35:12.805
Is this about the herpes?

35:15.742 --> 35:16.709
Come on, buddy.

35:18.077 --> 35:22.280
Forts are supposed to be a happy
occasion, not a herpe occasion.

35:22.314 --> 35:23.415
It's not funny.

35:24.349 --> 35:25.718
I was just trying
to cheer you up.

35:26.886 --> 35:29.655
It's just herpes, it's not like
your life is ending.

35:29.689 --> 35:31.590
My sex life is.

35:31.623 --> 35:35.795
Eh, no one wanted to have
sex with you anyway.

35:40.465 --> 35:42.534
Couldn't you just be better
about wearing condoms?

35:44.536 --> 35:47.572
The herpes virus is spread
through contact with skin

35:47.606 --> 35:50.342
that isn't necessarily covered
by condoms.

35:51.677 --> 35:53.512
It could have been
anything else.

35:53.545 --> 35:57.917
Any other STD is more curable
and less spreadable.

35:59.484 --> 36:01.921
They're actually called STIs
now,

36:01.954 --> 36:05.091
which makes me think that some IT
company got the raw end of that bargain.

36:05.124 --> 36:06.358
Bill.

36:09.061 --> 36:10.395
What about Lauren?

36:10.797 --> 36:12.665
Are things definitely done
between you two?

36:13.365 --> 36:14.399
Probably.

36:15.802 --> 36:18.370
I don't really know how to deal
with that situation. It's weird now.

36:18.838 --> 36:20.773
So, I can ask her out?

36:20.807 --> 36:23.608
- Bill, shut the fuck up.
- I'm kidding, I'm kidding.

36:27.079 --> 36:28.346
Did you tell her?

36:28.848 --> 36:31.818
About the herpes? No.

36:33.119 --> 36:35.054
I don't really wanna have
that conversation.

36:36.656 --> 36:39.524
I haven't spoken to her
since spring break.

36:40.860 --> 36:42.094
You should tell her.

36:48.801 --> 36:50.435
What about that girl
from the other night?

36:51.771 --> 36:52.939
Is anything going on there?

36:53.605 --> 36:55.574
The one that gave me herpes?

36:55.607 --> 36:58.744
No. Still peeved about
that?

36:58.778 --> 37:00.079
Yeah, a little bit.

37:02.949 --> 37:07.619
So I was gonna say if you liked
her, it'd be sort of perfect.

37:10.555 --> 37:15.795
Yeah. She was pretty great,
apart from the herpes.

37:16.863 --> 37:19.497
But she left
without saying anything,

37:19.531 --> 37:25.004
so I assume that she didn't want a repeat
transaction, which would be fine, you know?

37:25.805 --> 37:30.843
Because there was like three days when
I was excited to be a sexual being.

37:31.677 --> 37:35.948
There was a little part of me that was
ecstatic about the idea of having sex

37:35.982 --> 37:41.453
with multiple partners and not
having to have awkward conversations.

37:42.822 --> 37:45.590
Now I have to let that
little part of me die.

37:48.593 --> 37:50.997
Plus, I don't really remember
her name, so.

37:54.734 --> 37:55.668
Bummer.

38:00.139 --> 38:03.175
If you want to go out
for drinks, I'll buy.

38:04.609 --> 38:06.679
No, I don't really feel like
doing anything.

38:10.716 --> 38:11.817
Okay.

38:16.789 --> 38:18.124
Well, I'll be back later, buddy.

38:22.128 --> 38:23.129
Feel better, buddy.

38:40.980 --> 38:46.085
- You want me to close this?
- Yeah. Yeah.

38:54.126 --> 38:58.230
Now when the subject of altruism is
discussed within the scientific community,

38:58.264 --> 39:02.635
evidence that is often used by
naysayers is the Price equation.

39:02.668 --> 39:03.669
Who remembers
the Price equation?

39:05.705 --> 39:08.708
It defines the different factors
of animal behavior

39:08.741 --> 39:11.877
in relation to genetics
and reproductive fitness.

39:11.911 --> 39:13.212
Right.

39:13.245 --> 39:17.183
Dr. Barkley, does anyone ever
discuss George Price's actual life

39:17.216 --> 39:19.484
in terms of the validity
of the equation?

39:20.286 --> 39:21.619
It's pretty interesting.

39:21.654 --> 39:26.759
For those that don't know,
George Price had a messy personal life.

39:26.792 --> 39:28.995
However, after he developed
the equation,

39:29.028 --> 39:31.897
he became somewhat obsessed
with the implication

39:31.931 --> 39:34.200
that people could not
do good for good's sake.

39:34.233 --> 39:38.070
So he spent the rest of his life
trying to help the homeless.

39:38.104 --> 39:41.040
He gave away all his possession,
so on and so on.

39:41.073 --> 39:43.876
Proving that humans
can be altruistic.

39:43.909 --> 39:45.444
Oh, you know,
I think that's going a bit far.

39:45.478 --> 39:49.248
There are better studies out there if
you're trying to argue on the subject.

39:49.281 --> 39:51.050
Personally, I view it
as counterexample,

39:51.083 --> 39:55.087
meaning that people that he was trying to help
stole from him, he ended up killing himself.

39:55.121 --> 39:57.990
But doesn't suicide
go against the Price equation?

39:58.024 --> 40:00.592
It doesn't serve an organism
to self-destroy.

40:00.625 --> 40:03.129
I wouldn't say it goes against the Price
equation necessarily. You know what I mean?

40:03.162 --> 40:06.632
Like it's just a formula to better
understand the behavior of organisms.

40:06.665 --> 40:08.934
I mean, however, suicide
may be useful, right?

40:08.968 --> 40:11.837
If it ends the consumption
of resources by an organism

40:11.871 --> 40:14.073
so that it may be better used
by more fit kin.

40:14.106 --> 40:16.108
Yeah, but that's not why
he did it.

40:16.142 --> 40:17.710
He did it because
he couldn't help

40:17.743 --> 40:20.578
and because the drunk
homeless people stole from him.

40:21.047 --> 40:24.582
Perhaps, but, you know, at the end
of the day, he committed suicide,

40:24.616 --> 40:26.819
so I'd say
that kills your argument.

40:26.852 --> 40:32.691
In some sense, yes, but he tried,
he cared, he put in some effort,

40:32.725 --> 40:35.294
which is something that I think
is very human.

40:35.327 --> 40:40.299
I mean, yes, humans are animals, but
we have to be more than animals, right?

40:45.905 --> 40:46.772
Phone.

40:48.407 --> 40:49.607
Oh, sorry.

41:26.812 --> 41:29.682
<i>Adam? Hello?</i>

41:30.282 --> 41:33.752
- What?
- <i>Hey.</i>

41:36.122 --> 41:37.189
Is that all?

41:38.924 --> 41:41.961
- <i>Kyle's wedding?</i>
- Yeah, so?

41:44.029 --> 41:45.131
It's this weekend.

41:46.398 --> 41:47.666
Oh, shit.

41:51.737 --> 41:55.808
Yeah, that's... that's...
that's not gonna happen.

41:55.841 --> 41:57.676
<i>You have to.</i>

41:57.710 --> 42:03.849
<i>Both of our parents are going to be there and I
don't know what exactly is going on between us.</i>

42:03.883 --> 42:06.952
- You were the one that...
- <i>But I don't wanna talk about it right now</i>

42:06.986 --> 42:09.121
<i>and I don't wanna talk about it
to my parents</i>

42:09.155 --> 42:14.393
<i>and I'm sure you don't wanna
explain it to yours.</i>

42:14.426 --> 42:16.095
No, I guess not.

42:18.964 --> 42:21.967
<i>So, we're going?</i>

42:28.841 --> 42:30.109
Is there gonna be a keg?

42:31.510 --> 42:34.813
<i>No. And no.</i>

42:36.115 --> 42:37.116
Fine.

43:06.045 --> 43:07.880
Adam, you wanna dance?

43:07.913 --> 43:10.349
With you? No.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.819
No, come on. Why can't a father
have a dance with his son?

43:15.788 --> 43:17.456
First of all, who leads?

43:17.489 --> 43:19.358
You do. I wanna twirl.

43:20.259 --> 43:24.763
Get your wife to twirl you.
She could do it, too.

43:24.797 --> 43:26.365
Adam, I'm not kidding.

43:26.398 --> 43:28.434
She's a terrific dancer,
your mom.

43:28.467 --> 43:30.135
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

43:31.103 --> 43:33.939
Then why have I never
seen you two dance?

43:33.973 --> 43:39.478
Because I cannot and I'm too stubborn
to learn, but she is, uh, magnificent.

43:40.412 --> 43:43.182
High praise for a woman
who you're going to leave.

43:43.215 --> 43:47.419
Hey, a lot of stuff happens with
two people over a lot of years.

43:48.187 --> 43:51.357
And some of it sucks
but now I'm drunk, so.

43:55.427 --> 43:59.031
I'm thinking about what I said
the other day and bullshit.

43:59.965 --> 44:03.269
Marriage can be a, you know,
a beautiful institution.

44:03.302 --> 44:06.572
I'm glad it happened to me and
I'm glad you happened at all.

44:06.605 --> 44:08.941
Did I ever tell you how you happened,
like in detail how we conceived you?

44:08.974 --> 44:11.410
- Okay, okay.
- I was just telling Adam how we conceived him.

44:11.443 --> 44:14.546
Yeah, how come you are
traumatizing our child?

44:14.580 --> 44:16.215
And why aren't you dancing
with Lauren?

44:16.882 --> 44:19.118
- Did you guys have a fight?
- No, Mom, we're fine.

44:19.852 --> 44:22.154
Honey, I know all about it.

44:22.187 --> 44:25.891
When you've been together as long as you two
have you are going to irritate each other.

44:25.924 --> 44:28.193
Trust me, I know.

44:28.227 --> 44:29.729
You hurt my feelings.

44:29.763 --> 44:32.064
You know what, I'm gonna get another drink.
I'm not gonna get one for you.

44:32.097 --> 44:35.000
And that's called revenge,
family style.

44:36.368 --> 44:38.470
Come on, sweetheart.
I can tell.

44:38.504 --> 44:41.173
You've never been good
at hiding your wounds.

44:41.206 --> 44:42.875
What was the tiff about?

44:44.510 --> 44:50.182
Even if that were the case, which it's
not, doesn't that mean it doesn't work?

44:50.215 --> 44:52.151
- What doesn't work?
- The relationship.

44:53.218 --> 44:55.087
Sweetheart, let me tell you
something.

44:55.120 --> 44:59.058
All the fish in the sea out there
happen to be strikingly similar.

45:00.025 --> 45:02.194
That's a really depressing
thing to say.

45:02.227 --> 45:03.630
It's the truth, sweetheart.

45:03.663 --> 45:05.497
I mean, at the very least,
you're never gonna find one

45:05.531 --> 45:07.433
that doesn't peeve you off
at some point.

45:10.402 --> 45:11.537
Just go talk to her.

45:13.939 --> 45:15.541
All right,
knock off your jawing.

45:15.574 --> 45:17.209
Let's hit the dance floor.
Let's go.

45:18.043 --> 45:20.112
I'm gonna do it, let's go.
Or I'm gonna get another drink.

45:20.145 --> 45:25.017
Okay, you, go dance with her.
Don't throw it all away. Go.

45:25.050 --> 45:27.920
I am gonna go deal with this
wreck of a husband that I...

45:27.953 --> 45:30.022
Oh, God! Oh! Oh!

45:31.457 --> 45:33.459
Your mother's a terrific dancer,
I'm gonna step it up.

45:33.492 --> 45:36.395
I don't even have shoes,
put me down!

45:37.697 --> 45:39.565
Go. Go.

45:54.046 --> 45:57.182
- Hey, Adam.
- Hey, Kyle. Congratulations, Sir.

45:57.216 --> 45:58.317
Thanks, man.

45:58.350 --> 45:59.918
I suppose you wanna get in here?

45:59.952 --> 46:02.121
- I mean, it's your wedding.
- Oh, no, no, no, go ahead.

46:02.154 --> 46:03.355
She's stepping on my toes
anyway.

46:03.389 --> 46:05.257
Okay, speak for yourself,
you klutz.

46:05.290 --> 46:07.159
It's my wedding and I can step
where I want to.

46:10.262 --> 46:14.600
- So, I guess we should dance?
- Are ya sure?

46:14.634 --> 46:16.068
You hate dancing.

46:16.101 --> 46:18.137
I mean, we have to make
a show of it, right?

46:21.473 --> 46:22.508
Sorry.

46:23.743 --> 46:26.478
- My parents think that we're fighting?
- Yeah, mine, too.

46:26.512 --> 46:27.513
Are we?

46:28.414 --> 46:31.684
I mean, fighting isn't
the right word.

46:32.251 --> 46:34.953
Then what are we doing?
What's going on?

46:34.987 --> 46:38.023
I don't know. I don't...
I don't know how to feel.

46:38.056 --> 46:39.659
Adam, come on.
You knew the conditions.

46:39.692 --> 46:41.126
You've had as much time
as I have.

46:42.561 --> 46:49.468
Yeah, I know, but I just,
I thought that I was going to be able to

46:49.501 --> 46:51.704
have sex with someone else.

46:52.604 --> 46:54.273
Come on, you've had extra time.

46:54.306 --> 46:55.941
Haven't you closed the deal
with someone yet?

46:57.276 --> 46:59.478
Yeah, I have.

46:59.511 --> 47:02.314
Okay, and isn't that
good enough for you?

47:03.750 --> 47:07.286
Can't we just end all this weirdness
and go back to what we were before?

47:08.320 --> 47:11.290
Come on, Lauren, I don't even
know what we were before.

47:11.323 --> 47:14.326
Happy? I was happy.

47:16.094 --> 47:19.298
It's become a lot more
complicated than that.

47:19.331 --> 47:20.633
Why does it have to be?

47:20.667 --> 47:22.367
Hey, attention, everyone.

47:23.837 --> 47:28.407
The bride will be throwing flowers
over there, so everyone look that way.

47:34.079 --> 47:35.447
We're gonna cut the cake in 10.

47:37.684 --> 47:39.752
Figure we could kill a joint
in that amount of time.

47:39.786 --> 47:41.153
Ah!

47:45.190 --> 47:49.161
People who should be happiest
end up having no capacity for it

47:49.194 --> 47:51.463
because they're so worried about
whether or not they're gonna be happy.

47:52.464 --> 47:56.101
- You know what I mean?
- Like happy on the day or happy for like...

47:56.134 --> 47:57.704
On the day.

47:57.737 --> 48:00.472
But the other one, too, I guess.

48:04.677 --> 48:05.745
Yeah, I get that.

48:07.847 --> 48:11.116
I mean, I don't have
personal experience but...

48:11.149 --> 48:12.217
Oh, you will.

48:14.119 --> 48:15.187
Or will you?

48:16.856 --> 48:21.059
- I'm assuming you and Lauren...
- I know, I don't know.

48:22.227 --> 48:23.796
You know you don't know?

48:24.496 --> 48:25.698
I mean, I know.

48:25.732 --> 48:29.101
I... I know what you're asking,
but I don't know the answer.

48:31.738 --> 48:33.505
No need to get heavy,
man.

48:33.539 --> 48:36.141
Oh, I mean, I didn't mean to.
You know I was just...

48:36.174 --> 48:38.811
Enough said.
It's probably the weed talking.

48:40.412 --> 48:44.283
I'm protective of her.
She's my sister and shit.

48:45.517 --> 48:47.152
Yeah, I hear you.

48:47.185 --> 48:49.555
Not that I'm trying to pressure
you into anything.

48:49.588 --> 48:51.223
No, no, no, of course, not.

48:51.256 --> 48:55.460
But I feel like I should defend
her honor, whatever.

48:57.496 --> 48:59.699
Who knows if she has
any honor to speak of?

48:59.732 --> 49:01.400
And you're probably
a better judge of that.

49:05.203 --> 49:08.240
But I feel compelled
to say something.

49:11.243 --> 49:12.277
Yeah.

49:12.311 --> 49:17.750
I mean, Kyle, I don't know
if we're getting married

49:17.784 --> 49:21.186
and that's the only answer
I have really.

49:21.821 --> 49:26.625
I mean, it's been a smooth road, but I
just don't know if I wanna stay on it

49:26.659 --> 49:30.495
or if I have gone as far
as I wanna go, you know?

49:32.197 --> 49:34.767
- Say no more, my friend.
- Do you get that?

49:36.234 --> 49:37.302
Shit, yeah, man.

49:38.337 --> 49:40.372
Defining moment,
defining decision.

49:41.340 --> 49:43.542
Trying to figure out
if you're gonna stick it out.

49:44.844 --> 49:46.345
Not to be taken lightly.

49:47.379 --> 49:48.313
Any pointers?

49:49.548 --> 49:51.350
For deciding if you wanna
get married?

49:52.184 --> 49:55.253
No way, man.
No, that's tough stuff.

49:56.588 --> 49:59.324
That's for you
and your chosen higher being.

49:59.358 --> 50:02.227
Definitely a question
for a wiser man than I.

50:13.205 --> 50:15.574
- There you are.
- Ooh, are those for me?

50:15.607 --> 50:18.176
No, you dingus,
I caught the bouquet.

50:59.786 --> 51:06.291
Hey. Do you wanna talk?

51:08.961 --> 51:09.962
Yeah.

51:46.431 --> 51:47.633
Adam, I miss you.

51:50.036 --> 51:51.503
Can we just go back to normal?

51:54.539 --> 51:56.241
Lauren, things can't...

51:59.645 --> 52:02.247
I don't think we can
roll the clock back on this one.

52:05.718 --> 52:09.588
Oh, I see.

52:11.590 --> 52:17.295
- It's complicated.
- I get it.

52:19.498 --> 52:21.366
- Probably don't.
- Excuse me?

52:22.567 --> 52:25.470
- You don't think that I get it?
- Hold on, just let me...

52:25.504 --> 52:27.974
No, no, no, no,
I understand it perfectly.

52:28.607 --> 52:30.943
You wanted to wait until my brother's
wedding to break up with me.

52:30.977 --> 52:33.079
God, real great timing, Adam.

52:33.112 --> 52:35.748
- Whoa, that's not it at all, Lauren. There's more to it.
- Oh, my gosh, what?

52:35.782 --> 52:38.416
You can't be with me because
you think I'm some kind of slut?

52:38.450 --> 52:41.788
Or because you are not "adult"
enough to accept the fact that

52:41.821 --> 52:44.090
I've had casual sex
with other guys?

52:44.123 --> 52:46.058
Jesus Christ, Lauren, calm down.

52:46.092 --> 52:48.426
Do not tell me to calm down.

52:48.460 --> 52:51.898
All right, I'm sorry.
I am begging you, hear me out.

52:52.665 --> 52:55.735
- I slept with someone...
- So you say.

52:55.768 --> 52:57.136
Right, and since then...

52:57.170 --> 53:00.539
Yeah, yeah, you've slept with
someone and I've slept with Bill.

53:03.810 --> 53:04.944
So, deal with that.

53:45.517 --> 53:48.921
Now as a scientist,
I don't like to play favorites, all right.

53:48.955 --> 53:52.390
I mean, the natural world is awash
with beauty in some way or another

53:52.424 --> 53:56.095
and all of its disparate elements
are objectively equally beautiful.

53:56.128 --> 54:00.900
So let me just say this: If I have a
free moment, I watch elephant seals.

54:01.834 --> 54:05.838
Now, elephant seals,
they're harem breeders or colony breeders

54:05.872 --> 54:10.743
and they fight pretty much continuously
but especially during mating season.

54:10.776 --> 54:15.781
I mean, they fight to establish dominance,
they fight to preserve territory,

54:15.815 --> 54:18.184
but, ultimately, it's about
getting that action, right?

54:18.217 --> 54:20.720
And keeping that action,
should circumstances arise.

54:20.753 --> 54:24.724
I mean, come on, who wouldn't want
a piece of one of these studs?

55:39.665 --> 55:40.733
The sun.

55:45.304 --> 55:46.604
Am I right?

55:54.313 --> 55:55.881
I guess you could say that.

55:57.717 --> 56:01.687
- You know what's worse than the sun though?
- What?

56:01.721 --> 56:03.956
Your best friend having sex
with your girlfriend.

56:03.990 --> 56:06.759
Jesus Christ, can we move on?

56:08.060 --> 56:11.563
Like I told you multiple times I
wanted to sleep with your girlfriend.

56:11.596 --> 56:14.532
Call me crazy but I assumed
that was a joke.

56:14.566 --> 56:16.268
Which was funny
because it was true.

56:18.603 --> 56:24.810
Adam, Lauren is... really hot.

56:26.312 --> 56:27.612
Lauren's a babe.

56:29.115 --> 56:33.853
And, of course, that means that if the
opportunity presents itself then...

56:33.886 --> 56:36.689
All I'm saying is that if you want
to sleep with your girlfriend,

56:36.722 --> 56:39.258
chances are someone else does,
too.

56:40.793 --> 56:42.594
And she was freed up to do that,
so.

56:45.865 --> 56:50.169
I am not talking about her,
okay? I'm talking about you.

56:53.372 --> 56:57.043
It's not like it was some plan.
I wasn't scheming anything.

57:01.313 --> 57:05.617
You never wanted to go out,
so I was stuck going to the bars alone.

57:05.651 --> 57:07.686
One night Lauren's there
and then...

57:09.055 --> 57:11.991
- And then what?
- Then it happened.

57:12.892 --> 57:14.894
Happened, just happened?

57:14.927 --> 57:16.561
Yeah, it just happened.

57:17.296 --> 57:20.299
I don't think I facilitated it
but maybe I did.

57:20.332 --> 57:21.300
Fuck you.

57:22.868 --> 57:26.238
Look, what does it matter now?
You have herpes.

57:26.272 --> 57:28.606
If she takes you back,
she's a saint.

57:30.976 --> 57:32.178
If she doesn't, who cares?

57:32.878 --> 57:34.313
I do.

57:34.346 --> 57:37.249
This is a serious
breach of trust.

57:37.283 --> 57:39.151
How so?

57:39.185 --> 57:42.054
Best friends don't sleep
with girlfriends.

57:42.822 --> 57:44.156
How am I your best friend?

57:47.827 --> 57:51.764
Seriously, how would you define
a best friend?

57:53.265 --> 57:56.235
I know everything
about your life,

57:56.268 --> 58:01.006
even down to those fine more disgusting
details that I don't give a shit about.

58:02.441 --> 58:04.343
When was the last time
you asked me how I'm doing?

58:06.278 --> 58:07.880
How my life is going?

58:10.049 --> 58:11.317
34 days.

58:12.985 --> 58:18.224
34 days I've been waiting to tell you
that I got into UC Irvine for grad school.

58:20.059 --> 58:23.863
I'm going to California after
graduation to look at apartments.

58:32.371 --> 58:34.340
What do you care?
You got your own problems.

58:34.373 --> 58:37.943
The herpes.
A girl who loves you.

58:39.712 --> 58:41.247
That was never a problem.

58:41.280 --> 58:42.781
You could've fooled me.

58:44.083 --> 58:46.318
She was all you ever
talked about.

58:46.352 --> 58:47.319
Whenever you weren't out
with her,

58:47.353 --> 58:49.989
you were back at home
complaining about her

58:54.426 --> 58:55.961
and I introduced you.

58:59.999 --> 59:01.433
And I liked her first.

59:05.938 --> 59:06.772
That sucked.

59:10.109 --> 59:15.915
Yeah, yeah, but...
yeah, I mean, yeah.

59:19.418 --> 59:20.352
Fuck.

59:23.989 --> 59:29.929
And it doesn't excuse anything,
but there it is.

59:31.764 --> 59:33.399
I'm sorry.

59:40.940 --> 59:46.045
Me, too. Kind of.
Not as much as you.

59:49.448 --> 59:50.449
Okay.

59:56.855 --> 59:58.290
Did you at least tell her, yet?

59:59.792 --> 1:00:02.394
Nope. Really gotta do that.

1:00:03.429 --> 1:00:07.433
- Sooner than later, I'd say.
- I know.

1:00:11.170 --> 1:00:13.038
Well, do you have any exams
this week?

1:00:25.584 --> 1:00:27.853
When
raised by non-kin offspring,

1:00:27.886 --> 1:00:30.089
some salamanders have
a developmental switch.

1:00:30.122 --> 1:00:33.292
So this causes them to grow larger
than their fellow nest mates,

1:00:33.325 --> 1:00:37.296
they grow huge teeth,
and they develop an urge to digest them.

1:00:39.932 --> 1:00:43.202
Now Tim Bergen discovered
that these same species of birds

1:00:43.235 --> 1:00:47.139
would rather sit atop a
synthetic eggs of a brighter hue

1:00:47.172 --> 1:00:49.575
rather than eggs that were
actually their own,

1:00:49.608 --> 1:00:52.344
what he referred to
as a supernormal stimuli.

1:00:52.378 --> 1:00:55.247
The same reason we enjoy
big fat cheeseburgers.

1:00:58.183 --> 1:01:02.855
Now these same birds also have a
mating song that varies regionally,

1:01:02.888 --> 1:01:08.027
so if one bird were to relocate,
its ability to mimic that regional variant

1:01:08.060 --> 1:01:10.963
is what determines its ability
to reproduce successfully,

1:01:10.996 --> 1:01:16.068
giving us once again another example of
how reproductive fitness is correlated

1:01:16.101 --> 1:01:17.803
to one's ability to adapt.

1:02:01.246 --> 1:02:03.015
Are you going to that
superhero party?

1:02:11.623 --> 1:02:13.158
Yeah, I was thinking about it.

1:02:15.561 --> 1:02:19.398
Yeah, I kinda want to go but
I don't have any superhero stuff.

1:02:22.368 --> 1:02:23.435
You don't have anything?

1:02:24.603 --> 1:02:25.504
No.

1:02:26.706 --> 1:02:28.107
What were you gonna go as?

1:02:29.608 --> 1:02:31.477
The Amazing Girlfriend Fucker.

1:02:38.550 --> 1:02:40.152
That wasn't funny.

1:02:40.185 --> 1:02:42.421
I was thinking about going
as Captain 'Merica.

1:02:44.022 --> 1:02:45.023
Did you shave?

1:02:49.228 --> 1:02:50.496
I didn't really feel like it.

1:02:52.364 --> 1:02:57.069
Say grizzly lumberjack
Paul Bunyan?

1:03:00.572 --> 1:03:04.943
I don't really have the height
or the lumber.

1:03:08.715 --> 1:03:11.651
Oh. You could be Jesus.

1:03:14.019 --> 1:03:16.522
Oh, Jesus did all sorts
of super things. Yeah.

1:03:16.555 --> 1:03:21.527
Jesus can walk on water;
Jesus can turn water into wine;

1:03:21.560 --> 1:03:26.131
Jesus can turn fish and loaves
into more fish and more loaves.

1:03:26.165 --> 1:03:27.634
Those are all superpowers.

1:03:30.637 --> 1:03:32.371
You don't think anyone
will be offended?

1:03:42.381 --> 1:03:46.518
Would I be able to borrow
your white robe?

1:03:46.552 --> 1:03:49.221
Nah, I traded it for drugs
one time.

1:03:49.254 --> 1:03:51.290
Damn it. Foiled.

1:03:53.459 --> 1:03:55.093
Who says he wears a robe?

1:04:02.468 --> 1:04:04.369
Loaves, fish.

1:04:09.308 --> 1:04:10.576
Captain America?

1:04:11.644 --> 1:04:13.045
Captain 'Merica.

1:04:16.749 --> 1:04:17.717
Holy water?

1:04:21.453 --> 1:04:22.655
Yes, please.

1:04:32.564 --> 1:04:33.800
Oh, my God!

1:04:33.833 --> 1:04:35.702
Not cool, dude.

1:04:37.436 --> 1:04:39.004
I'm sorry, man.

1:04:39.571 --> 1:04:42.341
It's college, I just assumed
no one's religious.

1:04:42.374 --> 1:04:43.676
Yeah, fuck.

1:04:44.510 --> 1:04:47.647
You know, anyone with a problem
with post-modern Jesus

1:04:47.680 --> 1:04:50.616
has their own issues
as far as I am concerned.

1:04:50.650 --> 1:04:51.784
Probably.

1:04:52.719 --> 1:04:55.254
But WWJD though, right?

1:04:55.287 --> 1:04:56.756
Yeah, fuckin' GD.

1:04:57.623 --> 1:04:58.725
Goddamn.

1:05:00.192 --> 1:05:02.194
No, get drunk.
Where's the keg?

1:05:03.462 --> 1:05:07.099
I don't know. I'll go find it.
Stay here.

1:05:21.346 --> 1:05:25.350
Adam. You're here.

1:05:26.285 --> 1:05:29.521
- Hey, Lauren.
- When did you get here?

1:05:29.555 --> 1:05:31.423
Just a second ago. You?

1:05:31.891 --> 1:05:35.762
I've been here since eight.
I'm wasted.

1:05:38.430 --> 1:05:42.301
Have you "calmed down"
since the whole...

1:05:42.334 --> 1:05:43.335
No.

1:05:44.469 --> 1:05:50.475
I mean, yeah, maybe a little bit
but I mean, come on...

1:05:50.509 --> 1:05:54.613
I can only carry two beers.
Who's this?

1:05:59.585 --> 1:06:03.723
Oh. Weird.

1:06:05.424 --> 1:06:06.558
Yeah.

1:06:09.294 --> 1:06:10.429
Cheers.

1:06:21.239 --> 1:06:22.742
Is one of those for me?

1:06:25.878 --> 1:06:27.145
No.

1:06:40.225 --> 1:06:41.360
I'm outta beer.

1:07:07.285 --> 1:07:11.390
- Lauren, wait.
- I can't. Oh, my God! It has been so long.

1:07:13.225 --> 1:07:16.495
- Not that long apparently.
- Oh, my God! Shut up, stupid. I meant with you.

1:07:16.528 --> 1:07:19.231
God, I have, mwah, missed you.

1:07:19.799 --> 1:07:22.401
- And Bill will suffice in my absence.
- Oh, God!

1:07:22.434 --> 1:07:24.637
Shut up, I don't care
about Bill, okay?

1:07:24.671 --> 1:07:26.639
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

1:07:26.673 --> 1:07:32.377
You are all...
that I care about.

1:07:32.411 --> 1:07:35.380
Lauren, Lauren, Lauren, stop.
Lauren, we have to talk.

1:07:35.414 --> 1:07:37.416
Oh, my God!
I don't want to talk, okay?

1:07:37.449 --> 1:07:39.919
We have talked ourselves
into too much trouble.

1:07:39.952 --> 1:07:41.654
- Let us fuck...
- Stop!

1:07:47.426 --> 1:07:48.593
I have herpes.

1:07:53.766 --> 1:07:56.501
Excuse me?

1:07:57.770 --> 1:07:59.972
I have herpes.

1:08:00.006 --> 1:08:02.407
Nobody's happy about it
but that's the truth.

1:08:02.441 --> 1:08:04.509
Wow. This is...

1:08:05.845 --> 1:08:07.647
So it's understandable
if you don't...

1:08:07.680 --> 1:08:10.650
I mean, I understand
if you don't really want to.

1:08:10.683 --> 1:08:12.517
I mean, we probably shouldn't.

1:08:14.153 --> 1:08:18.290
Yeah, yeah, yeah, probably not because
it's kind of a problem, you having herpes.

1:08:19.324 --> 1:08:21.560
Jesus.

1:08:21.593 --> 1:08:23.562
We were gonna get married.

1:08:23.595 --> 1:08:24.630
I know.

1:08:27.599 --> 1:08:28.901
I guess that's off the table,
huh?

1:08:28.935 --> 1:08:31.904
No. I mean, yes, yes,
definitely yes.

1:08:31.938 --> 1:08:34.941
I would say definitively yes,
we are not getting married.

1:08:34.974 --> 1:08:39.411
That's awfully big of you, Lauren. I mean,
your generosity is just overwhelming.

1:08:39.879 --> 1:08:43.916
What? Oh, I'm sorry, I'm supposed to
stay with you because I feel bad for you?

1:08:44.984 --> 1:08:46.251
Fuck you, Lauren.

1:08:49.756 --> 1:08:51.657
If it helps,
I was sleeping around.

1:08:53.325 --> 1:08:54.961
Yeah, that was the
agreement.

1:08:54.994 --> 1:08:58.898
No. No, like before that?

1:08:58.931 --> 1:09:00.432
I was sleeping around.

1:09:03.770 --> 1:09:06.706
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Adam.

1:09:07.606 --> 1:09:09.642
Come on, it's college.

1:09:09.675 --> 1:09:12.577
It's meant for fun
and exploration.

1:09:14.647 --> 1:09:19.618
- Then why stay in a relationship?
- Because I loved you.

1:09:20.552 --> 1:09:22.054
Past tense already, huh?

1:09:22.088 --> 1:09:25.423
I guess it just didn't occur to me that
maybe you would want to get married

1:09:25.457 --> 1:09:28.694
and it hadn't occurred to me
that maybe I would, too.

1:09:28.728 --> 1:09:31.030
God, I gave you the same
opportunity I gave myself.

1:09:38.805 --> 1:09:44.309
Adam. Spoiler alert,
Bill had sex with Lauren.

1:09:58.758 --> 1:10:02.327
- So, Lauren was sleeping around.
- Yeah.

1:10:04.529 --> 1:10:06.098
No, like for a while.

1:10:09.769 --> 1:10:12.672
- Like more than just me?
- Apparently.

1:10:15.775 --> 1:10:17.576
Oh, shit, man. I'm sorry.

1:10:20.813 --> 1:10:21.948
Like, for how long?

1:10:24.150 --> 1:10:25.084
I don't know.

1:10:27.086 --> 1:10:30.455
But you know what? Fuck that.
What's up with you?

1:10:34.626 --> 1:10:36.696
Oh, oh, okay.

1:10:50.910 --> 1:10:51.944
Not much.

1:10:58.550 --> 1:11:01.787
- Crazy in there, eh?
- Fuck, yeah, it is.

1:11:01.821 --> 1:11:04.589
There's weed upstairs
and beer pong downstairs.

1:11:05.624 --> 1:11:06.959
Last night of college.

1:11:07.960 --> 1:11:09.061
What are you thinking?

1:11:16.802 --> 1:11:21.207
- Who wants to hold my legs?
- Keg stand!

1:11:21.240 --> 1:11:24.710
Keg stand!

1:11:24.744 --> 1:11:30.482
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, 10,

1:11:30.515 --> 1:11:34.552
11, 12, 13, 14, 15,

1:11:34.586 --> 1:11:39.158
16, 17, 18, 19, 20.

1:11:40.993 --> 1:11:44.063
Adam, Adam, Adam,
talk to me. Are you okay?

1:11:45.765 --> 1:11:49.035
- What? Why am I on the floor?
- Do you understand what I'm saying to you?

1:11:49.068 --> 1:11:53.873
It's you! It's... D... D... D... D...
something that starts with a D.

1:11:53.906 --> 1:11:56.208
- Darbee.
- Yes, you gave me herpes.

1:11:56.242 --> 1:11:59.645
- What are you talking about?
- You ruined my life.

1:11:59.679 --> 1:12:01.613
Please, Adam, did you
hit your head on something?

1:12:01.647 --> 1:12:03.983
No, damn it, I'm fine.
I'm standing up.

1:12:04.016 --> 1:12:07.653
Please, don't stand up, Adam.
You need to stay on the ground.

1:12:07.687 --> 1:12:09.055
See?

1:12:09.088 --> 1:12:10.455
Jesus has risen.

1:12:51.797 --> 1:12:54.266
- Damn it, Adam.
- Hey, Megazord.

1:12:54.300 --> 1:12:55.735
What happened?

1:12:57.136 --> 1:12:59.005
I cannot believe
you wake up now.

1:12:59.038 --> 1:13:01.207
She's here all night
waiting on her test results

1:13:01.240 --> 1:13:03.042
and she just leaves
and now you decide to wake up?

1:13:03.743 --> 1:13:04.877
I can go back to sleep.

1:13:04.910 --> 1:13:07.747
No, no, you're not going
back to sleep.

1:13:07.780 --> 1:13:11.583
God, you basically forced me
to test her for herpes?

1:13:11.616 --> 1:13:13.085
I felt like such a jackhole.

1:13:13.119 --> 1:13:14.253
You are a jackhole.

1:13:14.286 --> 1:13:17.957
No, you are a jackhole, Adam.

1:13:17.990 --> 1:13:20.793
- She doesn't have herpes.
- Who, Dinty?

1:13:21.293 --> 1:13:25.264
Darbee, you dumb. It was
probably Lauren that gave it to you.

1:13:26.832 --> 1:13:28.868
Oh, damn it, that's the worst.

1:13:28.901 --> 1:13:30.336
No, Adam, you're the worst.

1:13:30.369 --> 1:13:32.304
How is it that I know
Darbee's name and you don't?

1:13:32.338 --> 1:13:36.042
- I was close.
- Okay, you need to get up, get outside

1:13:36.075 --> 1:13:39.045
and apologize to that girl,
pull your shit together, and do it quickly

1:13:39.078 --> 1:13:42.181
because we have to meet Mom and
Dad for your stupid graduation.

1:14:02.068 --> 1:14:04.336
- Darbee.
- You're alive.

1:14:04.370 --> 1:14:06.005
Yeah, just barely.

1:14:06.038 --> 1:14:07.840
Don't you have something
to say to me?

1:14:07.873 --> 1:14:09.642
Yeah, sorry.

1:14:09.675 --> 1:14:11.210
Sorry and?

1:14:11.243 --> 1:14:14.914
And congratulations on not
having herpes, that's great.

1:14:14.947 --> 1:14:16.348
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1:14:16.382 --> 1:14:18.918
Some of us do have herpes,
so that's a biggie.

1:14:18.951 --> 1:14:22.721
You know, you act like you're the
only person that has any problems.

1:14:22.755 --> 1:14:26.659
- You're graduating today.
- So? You don't even care about college.

1:14:26.692 --> 1:14:28.027
Actually, I do.

1:14:28.961 --> 1:14:30.830
I wanna get my degree someday.

1:14:31.330 --> 1:14:34.667
But unlike you I actually
have to pay for it myself.

1:14:35.434 --> 1:14:39.205
And because of your shenanigans last night,
I missed my shift at work this morning.

1:14:40.172 --> 1:14:42.041
And I left my keys
in that house,

1:14:42.074 --> 1:14:45.811
so now I get to walk across
the town in this stupid outfit.

1:14:45.845 --> 1:14:47.313
How dare you,
that's a fantastic...

1:14:47.346 --> 1:14:49.982
- This is all your fault!
- I'm sorry.

1:14:51.016 --> 1:14:52.818
Stop saying you're sorry.

1:14:53.786 --> 1:14:56.789
Say thank you
for saving your life.

1:14:57.356 --> 1:14:59.191
Thank you for saving your life.

1:15:04.864 --> 1:15:05.898
You get it?

1:15:10.002 --> 1:15:11.203
She gets it.

1:15:20.713 --> 1:15:24.049
- Hey, Professor?
- Oh, oh, hello, yeah.

1:15:24.083 --> 1:15:26.051
Where is... where is graduation?

1:15:26.085 --> 1:15:28.320
I... I thought that it was in
the auditorium next door.

1:15:29.722 --> 1:15:33.058
You know, I like to think that
graduation is inside all of us.

1:15:34.326 --> 1:15:35.694
What?

1:15:37.163 --> 1:15:40.799
It's... it's humor. I'm joking.

1:15:40.833 --> 1:15:44.203
Never mind, I'm sorry.
I have no idea where your graduation is.

1:15:44.236 --> 1:15:45.371
Aren't you supposed to
be there?

1:15:45.404 --> 1:15:47.473
No, I'm still
pretty new here.

1:15:47.506 --> 1:15:49.074
Oh, right.

1:15:49.108 --> 1:15:50.276
Are you a biology student?

1:15:50.309 --> 1:15:52.978
No, anthropology, but I took
your Animal Behavior class.

1:15:53.012 --> 1:15:54.914
Okay, so human behavior for you.

1:15:56.549 --> 1:16:00.452
Yeah, but maybe I'll try biology when
anthropology doesn't change my tax bracket.

1:16:00.486 --> 1:16:02.154
Good luck with that.

1:16:02.188 --> 1:16:03.189
What'd you think of
my class though?

1:16:03.222 --> 1:16:04.790
Like, you know,
if you don't mind?

1:16:04.823 --> 1:16:06.192
It was good.

1:16:06.225 --> 1:16:08.894
It... it made me think
about things differently.

1:16:08.928 --> 1:16:10.129
Differently in what way?

1:16:11.564 --> 1:16:14.733
It made me think about things in my
own life, about human interaction.

1:16:14.767 --> 1:16:17.102
No, sorry, I gotta stop you
right there.

1:16:17.136 --> 1:16:19.805
I really hope you're in
the minority on that.

1:16:19.838 --> 1:16:22.908
I mean, it's just like,
so little of what I've taught here, man,

1:16:22.942 --> 1:16:25.411
is about directly
translating that to humanity.

1:16:25.444 --> 1:16:27.079
I mean, that's the
whole problem.

1:16:27.112 --> 1:16:30.015
That's... that's why I'm here on the weekend
trying to sterilize my gestures, right?

1:16:30.049 --> 1:16:33.219
It's just that you college
students are so sexualized,

1:16:33.252 --> 1:16:36.822
somehow you can't like, remove
things from your own experience.

1:16:36.855 --> 1:16:40.192
Whoa, you're here trying to
make yourself less sexy?

1:16:42.828 --> 1:16:44.863
The problem's
anthropomorphizing, all right?

1:16:44.897 --> 1:16:46.799
I'm sorry; I should have
made that more clear.

1:16:46.832 --> 1:16:49.468
I mean, are we as humans completely
outside of these constraints

1:16:49.501 --> 1:16:52.338
I've been talking about?
No, not at all.

1:16:52.371 --> 1:16:54.340
It's just that we have
separate priorities.

1:16:54.373 --> 1:16:56.508
A different social field,
different parameters.

1:16:56.542 --> 1:17:01.113
We have a consciousness that allows us to
take better control of ourselves, all right?

1:17:02.147 --> 1:17:03.449
So when you think
about all that, I mean,

1:17:03.482 --> 1:17:06.518
humans, we can analyze what's
best for the individual or society

1:17:06.552 --> 1:17:08.420
long before natural selection.

1:17:08.454 --> 1:17:10.522
We can look out for
our best interests

1:17:10.556 --> 1:17:16.262
or broader interests or leave
the classroom completely.

1:17:20.599 --> 1:17:22.067
You would never leave me, pizza.

1:17:23.202 --> 1:17:24.536
You would never leave me.

1:17:24.570 --> 1:17:26.505
Argh.

1:17:27.406 --> 1:17:29.108
I should have married you,
pizza.

1:17:29.508 --> 1:17:32.077
I should've
married you.

1:18:19.925 --> 1:18:23.162
- Thank you.
- What was that?

1:18:23.195 --> 1:18:25.864
I said thank you
for helping me last night.

1:18:27.499 --> 1:18:28.834
You're welcome.

1:18:29.401 --> 1:18:31.170
But also, you suck.

1:18:31.970 --> 1:18:33.038
Excuse me?

1:18:33.939 --> 1:18:35.607
Okay, look.

1:18:35.642 --> 1:18:39.545
I don't know how we met or what we drank or
how I got you into bed in the first place,

1:18:39.578 --> 1:18:41.980
but I think we had a good time.

1:18:42.014 --> 1:18:46.485
And... and I know I don't know you,
so that's stupid and this is stupid,

1:18:46.518 --> 1:18:50.889
but you were gone in the morning
and that hurt.

1:18:51.557 --> 1:18:53.292
So I'm just having
a little trouble.

1:18:54.226 --> 1:18:57.496
Yeah, there's lots of reasons
why people do stuff, okay?

1:18:57.529 --> 1:19:00.065
That's really vague.

1:19:00.099 --> 1:19:04.036
Meaning it's not like it
didn't mean anything to me.

1:19:05.437 --> 1:19:08.140
But, hey, you were clearly
gonna get attached.

1:19:08.941 --> 1:19:13.112
- Nuh-uh.
- Yeah-huh.

1:19:15.381 --> 1:19:17.516
And you were also
clearly reckless.

1:19:17.549 --> 1:19:19.918
The no condom thing?
Yeah, that was pretty reckless.

1:19:19.952 --> 1:19:21.420
Agreed.

1:19:21.453 --> 1:19:25.090
I'll give you it was only herpes,
but what if it had been something worse?

1:19:25.124 --> 1:19:28.360
Either way,
be more careful, okay?

1:19:30.195 --> 1:19:31.997
Yes, okay.

1:19:32.632 --> 1:19:34.166
Also, you don't have
to worry about it.

1:19:34.199 --> 1:19:36.502
I won't be having sex
with anyone anymore.

1:19:37.637 --> 1:19:41.340
Haven't you seen those
commercials where the guy is like,

1:19:42.174 --> 1:19:45.978
"I have herpes" and then
the girl is like, "And I don't."

1:19:46.011 --> 1:19:50.282
And the implication is that they're
shacking up, so, obviously, there's hope.

1:19:51.450 --> 1:19:55.954
And maybe one day
you'll meet somebody

1:19:55.988 --> 1:20:00.125
who will like you a lot
and they'll think it's worth it.

1:20:04.163 --> 1:20:05.330
Wait, why are you
still here?

1:20:06.031 --> 1:20:07.332
The door is locked.

1:20:07.366 --> 1:20:09.101
I think everyone's
at graduation.

1:20:10.637 --> 1:20:12.337
Well, I'm kinda glad
no one is home.

1:20:13.338 --> 1:20:15.941
I just wish I had
a pillow so I could take a nap.

1:20:20.345 --> 1:20:21.280
Hold on.

1:20:36.663 --> 1:20:38.631
Why didn't you just
bring me my keys?

1:20:41.166 --> 1:20:42.234
Oh, shit.

1:20:43.469 --> 1:20:46.071
I'm sorry, I am not banging on
all cylinders this morning.

1:20:46.104 --> 1:20:48.040
Oh, it's fine,
just give me the pillow.

1:20:54.112 --> 1:20:56.014
Is there any more room
in that hammock?

1:20:58.417 --> 1:20:59.585
Yeah, come on.

1:21:11.530 --> 1:21:17.737
- Aren't you going to miss graduation?
- Yeah.

1:21:18.470 --> 1:21:20.439
The important thing is
that you celebrate it.

1:21:23.375 --> 1:21:25.544
I think last night will do me
for a while.

1:21:25.577 --> 1:21:26.578
Yeah.

1:21:31.316 --> 1:21:35.020
Hey. Be here when I wake up?

1:21:37.724 --> 1:21:41.560
I hope to impart to you
in this class love for the study of life

1:21:41.593 --> 1:21:45.832
because the beauty of it
really is unlimited, you know?

1:21:45.865 --> 1:21:49.535
There's always something
going on behind the scenes.

1:21:49.568 --> 1:21:53.372
There's always something brand new to
look at and a new way to look at it.

1:21:53.405 --> 1:21:55.073
So let's get started.
