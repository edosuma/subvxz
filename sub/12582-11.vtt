<b><font color="#0A7C32">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:32.682 --> 00:36.140
The so-called "Father of Our
Country," George Washington,

00:36.186 --> 00:38.313
felt shaking hands was
beneath the president,

00:38.354 --> 00:40.288
so he would, uh, bow.

00:40.323 --> 00:43.019
Now let's move on
to the War of 1812.

00:43.059 --> 00:45.323
Dolly Madison served
the first bowl of ice cream

00:45.361 --> 00:46.487
in the White House.

00:46.529 --> 00:47.757
True story.

00:47.797 --> 00:49.458
What are you doing?

00:49.499 --> 00:52.332
You really shouldn't let
your hair get so knotted,

00:52.368 --> 00:54.199
unless you want it to fall out.

00:54.237 --> 00:57.365
If you wanted it to fall out,
I'm sorry for fixing it.

00:57.407 --> 01:00.535
No, you can fix it.

01:00.577 --> 01:02.977
John Adams may not
have had Morticia and Thing,

01:03.012 --> 01:05.480
but his economic policy
was just as scary.

01:07.050 --> 01:09.280
Wow, you're a really
good hairdresser.

01:09.319 --> 01:10.650
Thank you.

01:10.687 --> 01:13.713
I used to want to be one.

01:15.191 --> 01:16.590
PROFESSOR
Uh, Ms. Platter,

01:16.626 --> 01:19.186
you in my class to learn
history, or, uh, do hair?

01:21.297 --> 01:22.525
Hair!!

01:24.267 --> 01:27.703
The mashed potatoes
aren't as buttery as usual, Mom.

01:27.737 --> 01:29.227
Did we go poor?

01:29.272 --> 01:32.537
I learned something really
important at college today!

01:32.575 --> 01:34.907
I don't want to be there!

01:34.944 --> 01:36.241
What?!
Yeah.

01:36.279 --> 01:37.246
I quit!

01:37.280 --> 01:38.804
I'm gonna do hair.

01:38.848 --> 01:40.213
Well, you can't do that.

01:40.250 --> 01:42.480
There are bigger things
in life than hair.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.977
You have to stay in college
and develop your mind.

01:46.022 --> 01:47.319
Well, I don't know, Peggy.

01:47.357 --> 01:49.655
She's been at that
college for 2h years,

01:49.692 --> 01:51.421
and it's a
two-year college.

01:51.461 --> 01:54.259
Seems like they had a whack
at her and nothing took.

01:54.297 --> 01:56.527
It's true. Nothing did!

01:56.566 --> 01:59.160
You know, cutting hair
might be good for her.

01:59.202 --> 02:01.363
My barber Jack always says,

02:01.404 --> 02:04.168
"Hair grows even
during a recession."

02:04.207 --> 02:06.869
Well, that may be true
for licensed barbers.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.537
But may I remind you both

02:08.578 --> 02:10.545
that Luanne Platter,
hairstylist,

02:10.580 --> 02:12.548
failed her cosmetology test.

02:12.582 --> 02:16.450
Luanne Platter, history student,
would have known that.

02:19.622 --> 02:21.783
Maybe Luanne Platter,
dinner guest,

02:21.825 --> 02:23.588
could send the butter this way?

02:23.626 --> 02:26.026
Buck Strickland
never went to college

02:26.062 --> 02:27.893
and he runs four businesses

02:27.931 --> 02:29.831
and never writes anything down.

02:29.866 --> 02:32.460
Yeah, college wasn't for me.

02:32.502 --> 02:34.629
They made that very clear.

02:34.671 --> 02:37.299
Everyone's always
talking about college,

02:37.340 --> 02:40.241
but have any of you
ever actually seen one?

02:40.276 --> 02:43.939
Maybe Luanne should do what
I did and join the Army.

02:43.980 --> 02:45.106
No, that won't work.

02:45.148 --> 02:47.139
Luanne thinks
the Army is mean.

02:47.183 --> 02:48.582
She just wants to cut hair,

02:48.618 --> 02:50.449
but she flunked out
of beauty school

02:50.486 --> 02:51.748
and never got licensed.

02:51.788 --> 02:53.881
Well, if all she needs
is to pass her test,

02:53.923 --> 02:55.220
I can help her with that.

02:55.258 --> 02:57.726
I had to pass it
to become an Army barber.

02:57.760 --> 02:58.852
All right, Bill!

02:58.895 --> 03:01.455
Just don't scream
orders at her, though.

03:01.497 --> 03:02.623
She cries.

03:07.937 --> 03:10.462
Luanne, I can tell
you're nervous.

03:10.506 --> 03:11.996
If there's one thing
I've learned

03:12.041 --> 03:14.737
in my 20 years
of barbering, it's this...

03:14.777 --> 03:17.473
It will grow back.

03:17.513 --> 03:21.779
If you did a great job or
a bad job, it will grow back.

03:21.818 --> 03:25.151
Gosh. You sure know a lot
about cutting hair.

03:25.188 --> 03:28.214
Yeah, well, I've
been around a bit.

03:28.258 --> 03:30.453
I remember
when I was your age,

03:30.493 --> 03:32.791
life was so full
of possibilities.

03:32.829 --> 03:36.287
Bruce Jenner's hair had fired
the imagination of a nation.

03:36.332 --> 03:38.197
Oh...

03:38.234 --> 03:39.462
glory days.

03:39.502 --> 03:40.662
Mr. Dauterive,

03:40.703 --> 03:43.103
after I pass
my State Board exam,

03:43.139 --> 03:47.473
maybe I can live the dreams
that you're too old to live.

03:47.510 --> 03:49.535
You can!

04:02.125 --> 04:04.593
It will grow back.

04:20.576 --> 04:22.043
Well, look at her,

04:22.077 --> 04:23.670
getting ready for a career.

04:23.713 --> 04:25.442
Next thing, she'll
be complaining

04:25.481 --> 04:27.346
about how high her taxes are.

04:29.585 --> 04:31.553
Luanne, honey,
getting certified

04:31.587 --> 04:33.555
as a stylist
was the easy part.

04:33.589 --> 04:35.819
Now you have to
prepare yourself

04:35.858 --> 04:38.224
for the constant
rejection of the job hunt.

04:38.261 --> 04:39.660
You're a stylist?

04:39.696 --> 04:41.027
I'm Colette Davis.

04:41.064 --> 04:41.996
I own Hottyz.

04:43.066 --> 04:45.057
That's right,
the one with the Z.

04:46.369 --> 04:48.234
You brought the messy ponytail
to Arlen!

04:48.271 --> 04:51.900
And then two weeks later,
you trashed it as uncool!

04:51.941 --> 04:54.000
Guilty.

04:54.043 --> 04:56.511
You know, I think
you have the "Hottyz vibe."

04:56.546 --> 04:57.808
And I know vibe.

04:57.847 --> 05:00.145
The <i>Arlen Advocate</i> says
I invented it.

05:00.183 --> 05:02.344
Chair rental is 1,400 bucks.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.353
Oh, and FYI...

05:04.387 --> 05:07.823
Vibe, vibe, no vibe,

05:07.857 --> 05:10.382
mmm, crazy vibe.

05:11.427 --> 05:14.294
Wow! You were wrong,
Aunt Peggy.

05:14.330 --> 05:16.560
Finding a job was easy!

05:16.599 --> 05:18.931
Oh, yeah? What about
the chair rental?

05:18.968 --> 05:20.799
How are you going
to pay for it?

05:20.837 --> 05:22.896
I can give you
some money, Luanne.

05:22.939 --> 05:27.399
I was just going to use it on,
well, you know... the Internet.

05:27.443 --> 05:30.241
Well, I couldn't take
your money, Mr. Dauterive.

05:30.279 --> 05:31.473
Huh!

05:31.514 --> 05:33.607
Oh, but maybe we
could share the chair!

05:33.649 --> 05:36.880
No. I'm just an old
Army barber, Luanne.

05:36.919 --> 05:39.786
I packed that life away
with my Dolphin shorts.

05:39.822 --> 05:42.620
Mr. Dauterive, if you
don't take a chance,

05:42.658 --> 05:45.388
you'll end up miserable
like Mr. Dauterive.

05:46.529 --> 05:49.589
I mean... just
someone else.

05:49.632 --> 05:53.068
Look out, Hottyz, here I come!

05:53.102 --> 05:55.070
We're Hottyz! Whoo!

05:55.104 --> 05:56.799
Oh, for God's sakes, Hank.

05:56.839 --> 05:58.397
She'll be fine.

05:58.441 --> 06:01.376
Scrunchies for everyone!

06:06.516 --> 06:08.381
It's gonna be so cool
when we get to Hottyz,

06:08.418 --> 06:10.909
and they say, "Do you
have an appointment?"

06:10.953 --> 06:13.319
And we say,
"No, we work here,"

06:13.356 --> 06:14.914
and they say,
"No you don't."

06:14.957 --> 06:17.016
And we say, "Nuh-uh, we do!"

06:17.060 --> 06:19.722
And then we make up and
give them a great haircut!

06:19.762 --> 06:21.423
Last night,
I dreamed about hair!

06:21.464 --> 06:23.295
But it was a good
dream this time,

06:23.332 --> 06:25.926
not the one where it forms
a noose and hangs me.

06:27.970 --> 06:29.801
I'm so excited!

06:32.041 --> 06:33.167
Hi!

06:33.209 --> 06:35.006
I cut hair, too!

06:35.044 --> 06:37.706
Isn't it so much fun?!

06:52.695 --> 06:54.754
'Sup. You the new cutter?

06:54.797 --> 06:56.196
We both are.

06:56.232 --> 06:57.893
We're cutters!

06:59.268 --> 07:00.394
We're cutters.

07:00.436 --> 07:01.368
Whatever.

07:01.404 --> 07:02.632
Here are your uniforms.

07:06.509 --> 07:08.739
I'm never gonna take this off.

07:08.778 --> 07:11.269
I don't know if I could.

07:12.548 --> 07:15.210
Shh. Your hair is
trying to tell me

07:15.251 --> 07:18.152
all the nasty things it
wants me to do to it.

07:18.187 --> 07:19.415
That's Rico.

07:19.455 --> 07:21.650
He's flaming hot
and flaming gay.

07:21.691 --> 07:23.591
He's vibe squared.

07:23.626 --> 07:26.993
Hey, why is your client
wearing a Hottyz T-shirt?

07:27.029 --> 07:28.496
Oh, Mr. Dauterive?

07:28.531 --> 07:30.158
He's not my client.

07:30.199 --> 07:32.258
I couldn't afford
the chair on my own

07:32.301 --> 07:33.598
so we're sharing it.

07:33.636 --> 07:35.866
He taught me everything I know.

07:37.940 --> 07:41.432
Oh. Oh. No, no,
this is not going to work.

07:41.477 --> 07:42.603
Good-bye.

07:42.645 --> 07:45.512
But we already paid
a week's rent.

07:45.548 --> 07:48.039
And I dropped out
of school for this.

07:48.084 --> 07:49.676
Fine.

07:49.719 --> 07:52.586
You can stay the week.
But you're last chair.

07:52.622 --> 07:54.249
Audrey. Congrats.

07:54.290 --> 07:56.417
Grab your ferret
and your <i>Jane</i> magazines.

07:56.459 --> 07:58.051
You're chair four.

08:01.731 --> 08:03.460
Rico, I have closing
arguments in an hour

08:03.499 --> 08:05.330
and I need to look
jury friendly.

08:05.368 --> 08:06.995
Sorry, sweetie,
I'm all booked up.

08:07.036 --> 08:08.298
If you're real desperate,

08:08.337 --> 08:09.998
you might try the new
cutters in the back.

08:13.576 --> 08:15.908
I'm in a rush.
And I need to look...

08:15.945 --> 08:17.139
Oh, my gosh!

08:17.180 --> 08:19.045
You're are my first
ever client.

08:19.081 --> 08:20.708
Now don't be nervous.

08:20.750 --> 08:24.948
If I screw up,
it'll grow back.

08:24.987 --> 08:28.718
Let's get you shampooed.

08:28.758 --> 08:31.386
Hyah!

08:31.427 --> 08:33.952
<i>Mr. Dauterive got kicked
right in his...</i>

08:33.996 --> 08:37.557
Well, I didn't see
where her foot went,

08:37.600 --> 08:39.727
but she said, "Bull's-eye!"

08:39.769 --> 08:41.168
That's the real world for you.

08:41.203 --> 08:43.501
Mr. Dauterive getting
kicked in the groin.

08:43.539 --> 08:45.632
Don't you wish
you'd stayed in college?

08:46.976 --> 08:48.671
Luanne, I'll give
you a little tip.

08:48.711 --> 08:50.303
If you want to succeed,

08:50.346 --> 08:53.747
identify the most
successful person at work

08:53.783 --> 08:55.808
and do what they do.

08:55.851 --> 08:57.546
We'll do it.

09:01.257 --> 09:02.554
Hello, Luscious.

09:04.026 --> 09:05.323
What kind of love
are we making

09:05.361 --> 09:06.453
with your hair today?

09:06.495 --> 09:09.521
Rico is so successful.

09:09.565 --> 09:12.261
We have to do what he does.

09:12.301 --> 09:15.202
Did one of you breeders
take my flat brush?

09:15.238 --> 09:17.263
Rico, I heard you
with your client.

09:17.306 --> 09:19.797
You were very sexy.

09:19.842 --> 09:21.207
Yes, I know.

09:21.244 --> 09:23.405
People want to leave here
feeling hot and sexy

09:23.446 --> 09:24.845
and if you can't
give it to them,

09:24.880 --> 09:27.678
you may as well be
barbering down at Jack's.

09:27.717 --> 09:29.617
Please stand away
from the mirror.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.552
I like to watch myself
while I cut.

09:33.489 --> 09:35.218
He does have vibe.

09:35.258 --> 09:37.021
Mm-hmm.

09:39.095 --> 09:42.360
How would you like
your hair cut today?

09:46.802 --> 09:49.600
Dear Lord, I don't want
to go back to college,

09:49.639 --> 09:51.834
so please help me be sexy.

09:51.874 --> 09:53.102
Amen.

09:58.080 --> 10:00.878
Your hair is so sexy.

10:00.916 --> 10:03.510
It reminds me of... sex.

10:03.552 --> 10:05.486
Sorry, I'm late, everybody!

10:05.521 --> 10:08.684
My Pilates class ran long.

10:12.862 --> 10:14.420
I'm here for Rico.

10:14.463 --> 10:17.023
Well, B-Do can help you now.

10:18.267 --> 10:21.065
Psst. Are you
homosexual?

10:21.103 --> 10:22.583
I'm just trying to
act more like Rico.

10:22.605 --> 10:24.072
Huh. Me, too.

10:24.106 --> 10:26.574
If I accidentally
start acting not sexy,

10:26.609 --> 10:27.701
give me a sign.

10:27.743 --> 10:29.404
Go like this.

10:29.445 --> 10:33.677
Okay. And give me the sign
if I start acting not gay.

10:33.716 --> 10:38.676
You sizzle with a capital "S,"
capital "izzle."

10:40.289 --> 10:42.484
My boyfriend's taking me
to Lake Arlen

10:42.525 --> 10:45.221
for dinner and dancing
and then we...

10:45.261 --> 10:47.456
Tell me about your boyfriend.

10:47.496 --> 10:48.554
Is he cute?

10:48.597 --> 10:50.690
Does he have muscular thighs?

10:50.733 --> 10:52.098
Thieving slut.

10:52.134 --> 10:54.500
I bet he's the one who stole
my Yoplait from the fridge.

11:27.269 --> 11:30.238
the hottest
haircutting team in town.

11:30.272 --> 11:32.331
Whoo-hoo!
Whoo!

11:32.375 --> 11:33.933
Okay, girls,

11:33.976 --> 11:35.102
the next round's on me.

11:35.144 --> 11:37.339
I can't cut hair
without a hangover.

11:37.380 --> 11:40.645
I could go for a beer...

11:40.683 --> 11:42.742
Or, uh, a Pink Squirrel.

11:42.785 --> 11:45.345
Yeah, I like my drinks
the same as my men...

11:45.388 --> 11:48.289
strong and sweet
and under an umbrella.

11:48.324 --> 11:52.784
Hey, we've got some hotties
in the bar from Hottyz tonight.

11:52.828 --> 11:54.318
This one's for them.

11:56.365 --> 11:57.627
Come on, B-Do.

11:57.666 --> 11:59.065
Back that thang up.

11:59.101 --> 12:00.261
Show me the dance

12:00.302 --> 12:02.270
that got you kicked off
Fire Island, honey.

12:02.304 --> 12:03.828
Try and stop me.

12:06.375 --> 12:08.639
Ooh! Ah!

12:08.677 --> 12:11.612
Boy, if I weren't so dang gay...

12:11.647 --> 12:14.445
Aw, B-Do, I know it
must be hard for you

12:14.483 --> 12:15.814
in a town like this,

12:15.851 --> 12:19.309
with no 24-hour gyms
or TGI Fridays.

12:19.355 --> 12:22.620
Hey, I think that guy's
checking you out.

12:22.658 --> 12:23.920
Oh.

12:35.571 --> 12:37.766
Oh. My first
ten dollar tip.

12:37.807 --> 12:38.865
Thank you.

12:38.908 --> 12:42.207
Okay, now meow like a kitty.

12:42.244 --> 12:44.144
Meow?

12:44.180 --> 12:46.148
B-Do will not bite.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.911
I am gay.

12:47.950 --> 12:49.212
Luanne, B-Do,

12:49.251 --> 12:51.845
I am moving you
to second chair.

12:51.887 --> 12:52.876
Congrats.

12:52.922 --> 12:55.117
Second chair?!

12:55.157 --> 12:57.250
That's almost as good
as first chair.

12:59.428 --> 13:01.453
Hello.

13:01.497 --> 13:04.466
Which hair gel do you
suggest for my hair type?

13:04.500 --> 13:06.661
Virgin or Dirty Girl?

13:06.702 --> 13:08.397
Bobby. Truck.

13:08.437 --> 13:10.997
Uncle Hank, this is so great.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.406
I'm succeeding
in the real world,

13:13.442 --> 13:15.603
one up-do at a time.

13:15.644 --> 13:17.976
Well, that's good
to hear, I guess...

13:18.013 --> 13:20.038
I figured I'd come
to support you.

13:20.082 --> 13:21.549
You want a haircut?

13:21.584 --> 13:25.145
Uh, no, I just came
to support you.

13:25.187 --> 13:26.711
Good job.

13:26.755 --> 13:27.915
Bill?

13:27.957 --> 13:29.117
Hank?!

13:29.158 --> 13:30.250
Bill?!

13:30.292 --> 13:31.350
Hey, Hank.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.758
I can't talk now.
Little busy.

13:32.795 --> 13:33.784
See you at home.

13:33.829 --> 13:35.797
What happened to you?
What?

13:35.831 --> 13:37.765
You mean last night?

13:37.800 --> 13:39.097
You don't own me.

13:39.134 --> 13:40.965
Does your wife know you're here?

13:41.003 --> 13:43.597
Well, no.
I'm on my lunch break.

13:43.639 --> 13:45.903
: I can't keep
living like this, Hank!

13:45.941 --> 13:48.102
You've got a wife
and a family at home

13:48.143 --> 13:49.633
and I've got nothing.

13:53.182 --> 13:56.208
I just don't understand
why everybody

13:56.252 --> 13:59.244
is going to that nut house,
Hottyz, instead of here.

13:59.288 --> 14:01.222
Are you sure your
pole is working?

14:01.257 --> 14:03.088
Hottyz is the future, Hank.

14:03.125 --> 14:04.592
Who wants a haircut from Jack,

14:04.627 --> 14:06.788
when some pretty girl
with all her teeth can do it?

14:06.829 --> 14:08.524
Yeah, but they're going
to Bill, too,

14:08.564 --> 14:09.826
and he's acting like...

14:09.865 --> 14:10.923
Hold your head still

14:10.966 --> 14:12.797
unless you want me
to cut that ear off.

14:12.835 --> 14:15.201
Pirate?

14:15.237 --> 14:17.228
Gondola operator?

14:17.273 --> 14:18.570
Waiter?

14:18.607 --> 14:20.131
Pirate waiter!

14:20.175 --> 14:22.905
He's supposed to be gay, Dale.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.173
Really?

14:24.213 --> 14:25.510
I don't see it.

14:25.548 --> 14:27.573
I don't know why people
are always saying

14:27.616 --> 14:28.981
how hard it is to be gay.

14:29.018 --> 14:30.280
It's wonderful, really.

14:30.319 --> 14:31.843
You're not gay.

14:31.887 --> 14:33.184
They don't know that.

14:33.222 --> 14:35.156
Women who are normally
repulsed by me

14:35.190 --> 14:36.953
are letting me brush their hair,

14:36.992 --> 14:40.291
massage their shoulders,
compliment their bottoms.

14:40.329 --> 14:42.854
Hank, you know who else
went to college?

14:42.898 --> 14:44.195
Hey, Peggy.

14:44.233 --> 14:45.393
Let's go invite your hair

14:45.434 --> 14:47.231
to that party the rest
of you is throwing.

14:49.471 --> 14:52.201
Oh, Bill. Oh...

14:53.609 --> 14:56.169
Check me out
in first chair at Hottyz!

14:56.211 --> 14:58.441
I wanted to invite you guys
to a party tonight.

14:58.480 --> 15:01.040
Rumor is, the chick
they kicked off <i>American Idol</i>

15:01.083 --> 15:03.176
is going to be cage-dancing.

15:06.455 --> 15:07.649
B-Do, Scott dumped me,

15:07.690 --> 15:09.783
and I need him to see
what he's missing!

15:09.825 --> 15:11.190
Oh, honey,

15:11.226 --> 15:13.990
I swear on a stack of gladiators
I will take care of you.

15:14.029 --> 15:16.395
Hey! First chair!

15:16.432 --> 15:18.730
I don't want to get hair
on my blouse.

15:24.907 --> 15:26.204
Oh...

15:28.010 --> 15:29.443
Did you say something?

15:29.478 --> 15:31.912
I saw your bosom move
like you said something.

15:31.947 --> 15:35.075
Kutt mistress said
you got dumped by your guy, too.

15:35.117 --> 15:37.210
I know.

15:37.252 --> 15:41.018
I do astrology, and I can tell
we're kindred souls, B-Do.

15:42.725 --> 15:44.352
We're too much for our men.

15:44.393 --> 15:46.691
Oh, your aura's so warm.

15:46.729 --> 15:49.357
It's a shame you're gay.

15:53.969 --> 15:55.937
I'm not gay!

15:59.108 --> 16:00.234
No! I'm not gay!

16:00.275 --> 16:02.004
We can be together,
you and me...

16:02.044 --> 16:04.205
our-our kindred souls!

16:04.246 --> 16:06.214
You're not gay?
Uh-uh. Hundred percent

16:06.248 --> 16:07.272
into ladies.

16:07.316 --> 16:09.375
Who wants a hug?
L-I do!

16:09.418 --> 16:11.443
Ew! You're disgusting!

16:11.487 --> 16:12.715
You liar!

16:12.755 --> 16:15.417
I shared a Coke with him!

16:15.457 --> 16:17.425
I let him swim in my pool!

16:17.459 --> 16:18.949
Yeah, but... oh.

16:18.994 --> 16:21.758
It's all right.
A real gay man's here.

16:31.373 --> 16:32.897
Well, I take it back!
I am gay!

16:32.941 --> 16:33.965
Oh, you are?

16:35.310 --> 16:36.868
Bi?

16:36.912 --> 16:38.880
When you were gay,
you were intriguing,

16:38.914 --> 16:40.142
with an artistic bent,

16:40.182 --> 16:41.979
but now that you're straight,

16:42.017 --> 16:44.485
you're just...
a sleazy barber.

16:44.520 --> 16:47.853
Pack up and go back to that beer
commercial that you came from.

16:47.890 --> 16:49.790
But we're first chair!

16:49.825 --> 16:51.417
Luanne, honey,
you're fabulous.

16:51.460 --> 16:53.724
I mean, you've got great abs
and vibe to spare.

16:53.762 --> 16:55.059
I mean, if it was just you,

16:55.097 --> 16:56.928
I would hire you back
in a second.

16:56.965 --> 16:59.695
But since you and <i>that</i>
are a team,

16:59.735 --> 17:01.498
I got to let both of you go.

17:01.537 --> 17:02.970
But I belong here.

17:03.005 --> 17:04.869
I already failed
out of college.

17:04.906 --> 17:07.603
I cannot fail out
of the real world.

17:07.643 --> 17:10.635
There are no other
worlds for me to go to.

17:10.679 --> 17:12.977
We'll be all right, Luanne.

17:14.049 --> 17:16.074
Mr. Dauterive...

17:16.117 --> 17:18.450
Wow, this is really tough.

17:19.588 --> 17:21.282
You're fired.

17:21.323 --> 17:23.188
No, but we're a team.

17:23.224 --> 17:24.282
Sorry, B-Do...

17:24.326 --> 17:26.226
if that is your real name...

17:26.261 --> 17:27.728
the shirt stays here.

17:39.842 --> 17:41.776
Why can't I be gay?

17:41.810 --> 17:46.270
I had it all...
women, money, fancy clothes!

17:46.315 --> 17:49.682
Bill, I don't think
you were right for that salon.

17:49.718 --> 17:52.243
Everyone said the same
thing, only meaner.

17:53.422 --> 17:56.289
Right after I bought
$700 worth of shoes.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.953
Well, didn't Luanne
stand up for you?

17:58.994 --> 18:00.723
No. She threw my cottage cheese

18:00.763 --> 18:02.663
from the mini-fridge
in the street.

18:02.698 --> 18:05.030
What?! That is not right!

18:07.236 --> 18:11.639
So, uh, are you ever
gonna put on a shirt?

18:11.673 --> 18:13.368
So you used Bill up

18:13.408 --> 18:14.636
and you cast him aside.

18:14.676 --> 18:16.667
Do you have any idea
how hurtful that is

18:16.712 --> 18:18.236
every time it happens to him?

18:18.280 --> 18:20.009
I was just doing
what you told me

18:20.048 --> 18:22.278
and following the most
successful person.

18:22.317 --> 18:24.547
Now, that's Rico, and he said,

18:24.586 --> 18:27.885
"Sexy talks; bald
and straight walks."

18:27.923 --> 18:30.414
I never told you
to turn on your friends.

18:30.459 --> 18:32.427
Maybe your Aunt Peggy
was right.

18:32.461 --> 18:34.019
You need to go back to college

18:34.062 --> 18:37.054
and take some courses
in being a decent person.

18:50.445 --> 18:54.643
Kutt mistress, could
you stop spinning for a second?

18:54.683 --> 18:57.584
Mr. Dauterive is
a great hair stylist.

18:57.619 --> 18:58.779
Don't you see?

18:58.821 --> 19:01.585
Mr. Dauterive can't help
that he's straight.

19:01.623 --> 19:03.113
It's just the way he was born.

19:03.158 --> 19:05.388
It's in his DNAs!

19:06.762 --> 19:09.697
Now, hair does not know gay
from straight.

19:09.731 --> 19:12.097
It just wants to be loved.

19:12.134 --> 19:14.398
Shouldn't we all
be more like hair?

19:15.804 --> 19:17.863
I know I wish I had
been more like hair

19:17.906 --> 19:20.136
to my friend,
Mr. Dauterive.

19:23.478 --> 19:25.378
Very touching.

19:25.414 --> 19:26.676
You're both fired.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.718
It's great to stop pretending
I'm someone else

19:34.756 --> 19:37.452
so I can go back
to pretending I'm me again.

19:37.492 --> 19:39.960
I'm just gonna really
miss cutting hair.

19:39.995 --> 19:41.986
It was so great
to be able to moonlight

19:42.030 --> 19:44.191
and have an outlet
for my creative jones.

19:44.233 --> 19:47.396
Jack must be the luckiest man
in the world.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.735
He's doing what he loves and doesn't
have to worry about anything but hair.

19:52.040 --> 19:54.201
I'm gonna torch this place.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.470
Well, maybe I can
help you all out.

20:03.819 --> 20:04.945
Hey there, Hank.

20:04.987 --> 20:06.147
Want another haircut?

20:06.188 --> 20:07.485
You can pay me in food.

20:07.522 --> 20:09.149
I'll shave you for a sandwich.

20:09.191 --> 20:11.182
What if I gave you
something better?

20:11.226 --> 20:13.694
My niece Luanne here
is a great hair cutter,

20:13.729 --> 20:15.959
and you'd be lucky
to have her services.

20:15.998 --> 20:19.161
Aren't you the first chair
from Hottyz?

20:19.201 --> 20:21.362
I was. W-We were.

20:21.403 --> 20:23.337
Uh, Mr. Dauterive and me.

20:23.372 --> 20:26.569
All right!
I stole Hottyz first chair away!

20:26.608 --> 20:30.066
And so the scales begin
to tip for Jack.

20:30.112 --> 20:33.707
Hmm, maybe I'll start paying
back the muscular dystrophy jar.

20:44.860 --> 20:48.387
You and Bill really turned
things around here, Luanne.

20:48.430 --> 20:50.455
Why don't you save the money
you're making now

20:50.499 --> 20:51.727
and move back in with us?

20:51.767 --> 20:53.792
You mean it?

20:53.835 --> 20:56.599
You don't think I need
to go back to college?

20:56.638 --> 20:59.471
No, I think you're
right where you should be.

20:59.508 --> 21:02.306
My God, you made me
look hot, huh?!

21:02.344 --> 21:04.539
And if your dad asks,

21:04.579 --> 21:07.912
just tell him it <i>will</i> grow back.

21:11.653 --> 21:17.113
