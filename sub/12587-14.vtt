<b><font color="#0E7521">Ripped By mstoll</font></b>

00:40.707 --> 00:43.836
You call that
a flag, Hank?

00:47.506 --> 00:49.600
Dang that Milton Street!

00:57.849 --> 01:00.068
Bobby, would you do me a favor
and stand up?

01:00.060 --> 01:02.233
I just want to see
if you still can.

01:05.816 --> 01:06.863
Come on, Bobby.

01:06.858 --> 01:08.110
Why don't you come out

01:08.110 --> 01:10.158
and help us put up
Fourth of July decorations?

01:10.153 --> 01:13.532
Thing is, Dad,
that sounds totally boring.

01:13.532 --> 01:16.786
It's cool if you're into boring,
but I'm not.

01:19.288 --> 01:21.507
Room, now.

01:21.498 --> 01:22.875
Whatever.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.844
I was kind of in the
mood for a nap anyway.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.719
Almost every
got-dang word

01:33.719 --> 01:36.848
that comes out of his mouth
lately is sarcastic.

01:36.847 --> 01:38.645
And he's even lazier than usual,

01:38.640 --> 01:40.187
if that's possible.

01:40.183 --> 01:43.562
Hank, the time to shape
Bobby's character is now,

01:43.562 --> 01:45.485
while the material is soft.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.529
In Bobby's case,
exceptionally soft.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.323
I don't know what to do here.

01:50.319 --> 01:51.821
I've already taken away

01:51.820 --> 01:53.538
everything Bobby considers fun,

01:53.530 --> 01:55.749
except the plastic ice cubes,

01:55.741 --> 01:57.163
'cause we all use 'em.

01:57.159 --> 01:59.878
If I had a son going through
a rebellious streak,

01:59.870 --> 02:02.214
I would just love him out of it.

02:02.205 --> 02:03.832
You rednecks are useless

02:03.832 --> 02:05.505
as a bucket full of armpits!

02:05.500 --> 02:07.252
No more breaks
till we figure out

02:07.252 --> 02:09.380
how to make Rainey Street
Fourth of July

02:09.378 --> 02:10.675
better than Milton Street's.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.640
They beat us
seven years in a row,

02:12.633 --> 02:15.182
but last year was the worst.

02:15.177 --> 02:17.680
I want to thank you all
for coming.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.101
And now,

02:19.097 --> 02:22.476
I give you Washington
Crossing the Delaware...

02:22.476 --> 02:23.819
in lights.

02:30.859 --> 02:34.705
Look! Milton Street
has real fireworks!

02:43.872 --> 02:46.170
You can have bunting for days

02:46.166 --> 02:48.885
and hot dogs that plump
to the size of footballs.

02:48.877 --> 02:51.300
It's all about the sky candy.

02:51.296 --> 02:52.843
Hank, I know you told me

02:52.839 --> 02:54.841
to stop bringing everyone
down in the alley,

02:54.841 --> 02:57.014
but I hear Heck
Dorland's in charge

02:57.010 --> 02:59.012
of Milton Street
fireworks again.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.728
That guy has
an unfair advantage.

03:02.724 --> 03:04.146
As a former firefighter,

03:04.142 --> 03:06.520
he can push
the pyrotechnic envelope

03:06.520 --> 03:09.820
while still taking
all necessary precautions.

03:09.815 --> 03:11.692
You better do something
fierce, Hank Hill,

03:11.692 --> 03:15.242
before Rainey Street becomes
a poor man's Milton Street.

03:15.237 --> 03:17.331
Good.

03:17.322 --> 03:18.824
You're angry.

03:18.990 --> 03:20.867
Now take it out on Heck Dorland!

03:20.867 --> 03:22.244
You bet I will.

03:22.244 --> 03:25.123
There's no way I'm letting
Rainey Street down again.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.877
Where the heck is Bobby?

03:29.876 --> 03:31.799
We're gonna be late for church.

03:31.795 --> 03:35.095
One minute,
45 second warning, Bobby!

03:41.471 --> 03:44.816
Bobby?

03:50.480 --> 03:52.073
I'm trying to sleep.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.442
Well, you succeeded.

03:53.442 --> 03:54.864
Now try to wake up.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.158
You're not missing church
two weeks in a row.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.451
What's to miss?

03:58.447 --> 04:00.370
It's always-- no
room at the inn,

04:00.365 --> 04:03.710
born in a manger,
stuff happens, the end.

04:03.702 --> 04:06.455
Well, I'm sorry
if the greatest story ever told

04:06.455 --> 04:09.334
doesn't have enough twists
and turns for you, Bobby.

04:09.332 --> 04:11.881
Now get dressed
and get your butt on your bike

04:11.877 --> 04:13.971
and ride to church.

04:18.007 --> 04:19.760
Come on, pants.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.428
I'm waitin' on you.

04:24.431 --> 04:27.105
Large pepperoni, thick crust.

04:27.100 --> 04:28.852
The cheesiest.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.446
Oh. Uh...

04:31.438 --> 04:33.406
cash.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.285
What is wrong with you, boy?

04:40.280 --> 04:41.873
Why weren't you at church?

04:41.865 --> 04:43.412
I was getting ready,

04:43.408 --> 04:46.287
but I worked up an appetite
looking for dress pants,

04:46.286 --> 04:50.416
so I ordered a pizza,
and that ate up a chunk of time.

04:50.415 --> 04:51.837
Where'd you get the money?

04:55.545 --> 04:56.888
He stole it!

04:56.880 --> 04:58.803
Hank, you check
the liquor cabinet,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.801
I'll look between his toes
for needle marks!

05:03.553 --> 05:06.352
Stealing money
from his own mother's purse?!

05:06.348 --> 05:07.816
Who does that?

05:07.808 --> 05:09.856
13 is that critical age

05:09.851 --> 05:12.445
when boys come to
a fork in the road.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.064
And when Bobby gets there,

05:14.064 --> 05:16.408
he might use that
fork to kill us.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.868
Isn't there some prison
we can take him to?

05:18.860 --> 05:20.783
Make him pee
in front of some criminals.

05:20.946 --> 05:22.289
That'll scare him straight.

05:22.280 --> 05:24.499
Hank, maybe this is happening

05:24.491 --> 05:26.118
because Bobby keeps
missing church.

05:26.117 --> 05:28.870
We need to get him back on
the right spiritual path,

05:28.870 --> 05:32.170
even if we have to prop him
up and shove him down it.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.594
If you can forgive
my eavesdropping,

05:35.585 --> 05:37.883
I can help your boy
with his sins.

05:37.879 --> 05:39.847
I'll take him to my church.

05:39.840 --> 05:41.183
Your church?

05:41.174 --> 05:42.801
Uh, that, uh...

05:42.801 --> 05:44.098
Uh, n-no.

05:44.094 --> 05:45.846
We cannot afford
to wait another week.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.848
Church is church,
no matter how much

05:47.848 --> 05:49.850
Lucky makes it sound
like a restaurant.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.773
Please let him go, Uncle Hank.

05:51.768 --> 05:52.860
I'm begging you!

05:52.853 --> 05:55.106
I don't want Bobby
to steal my baby

05:55.105 --> 05:56.732
and use her to buy pizza!

06:01.778 --> 06:03.371
This is your church?

06:03.363 --> 06:06.037
It sounds like
somebody's dying in there.

06:06.032 --> 06:07.329
No, Bobby.

06:07.325 --> 06:09.828
Someone's being born.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.709
We are all sinners!

06:14.708 --> 06:16.506
Each and every one of us.

06:16.501 --> 06:17.878
Sinner... sinner...

06:17.878 --> 06:19.346
big sinner...

06:19.337 --> 06:20.714
who repented!

06:20.714 --> 06:22.591
The wise karate man knew

06:22.591 --> 06:25.515
the unrighteous shall not
inherit the kingdom.

06:25.510 --> 06:26.682
Amen!
Hallelujah!

06:26.678 --> 06:28.680
Not the murderers, heretics,

06:28.680 --> 06:31.024
liars, the fornicators!

06:31.016 --> 06:34.270
Especially not the fornicators.

06:34.269 --> 06:36.647
I used to be one of them.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.865
They will burn!

06:38.857 --> 06:41.781
And hell is all kinds of hot,
my friends.

06:41.776 --> 06:44.279
You burn yourself on the stove--
That's hot, right?

06:44.279 --> 06:47.203
Icy cold, compared to hell.

06:47.198 --> 06:49.667
Lucky, can I hold your hand?

06:49.659 --> 06:52.879
If you want, you can hold both.

06:52.871 --> 06:54.214
Is there anyone here

06:54.205 --> 06:57.049
who is not on a first name basis
with the Lord?

06:57.042 --> 06:59.170
Any newcomers in the house?

06:59.169 --> 07:01.263
Got one right here.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.842
What's your name, son?

07:04.841 --> 07:06.309
Bobby Hill.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.724
Walk with me, friend.

07:08.720 --> 07:10.518
Have you sinned, son?

07:10.513 --> 07:12.140
Have you cheated, lied,

07:12.140 --> 07:14.063
stolen, coveted,

07:14.059 --> 07:17.063
idolated, been sloth-like?

07:18.146 --> 07:20.774
I've done all those things.

07:20.774 --> 07:23.493
I have disrespected my elders.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.078
I have been slothful

07:25.070 --> 07:28.540
in virtually every room
of my house!

07:28.531 --> 07:30.875
I even stole from my mother.

07:30.867 --> 07:32.084
He stole from his mother!

07:32.077 --> 07:33.374
Praise be the Lord!

07:33.370 --> 07:35.873
I feel so awful!

07:35.872 --> 07:38.876
I have a question
for you, Bobby Hill.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.877
Do you want salvation?

07:40.877 --> 07:42.879
Yes, sir, I do.

07:42.879 --> 07:45.803
Let me ask again,
just to be sure.

07:45.799 --> 07:47.767
Do you want salvation?

07:47.926 --> 07:50.850
Do you kind of want it,
or do you really want it?

07:50.845 --> 07:53.018
Do you want salvation?

07:53.014 --> 07:57.144
Do you, Bobby Hill,
want salvation?

07:57.143 --> 07:58.440
I want it!

07:58.436 --> 07:59.688
I want it bad!

07:59.688 --> 08:02.032
I want salvation!

08:02.023 --> 08:04.446
Welcome to the
kingdom of heaven.

08:04.442 --> 08:06.069
I am saved!

08:06.069 --> 08:08.538
Hallelujah!

08:20.458 --> 08:22.836
I got so worked up about Bobby

08:22.836 --> 08:24.304
and this deal
with Milton Street,

08:24.504 --> 08:27.599
I accidentally put 87
octane in the truck.

08:27.799 --> 08:29.016
I guess I'll be knocking

08:29.009 --> 08:31.432
and pinging my way
through this tank.

08:31.428 --> 08:33.772
There they are.

08:33.929 --> 08:36.604
Ooh, I hope Lucky's
church fixed him.

08:36.599 --> 08:38.317
Hey, guys, guess what?

08:38.308 --> 08:39.777
I've been saved!

08:39.936 --> 08:42.155
The preacher said
I was in a bad place,

08:42.147 --> 08:43.443
and if I didn't change,

08:43.440 --> 08:45.408
the devil would burn
all my skin off.

08:45.400 --> 08:46.822
Well, all right, Bobby.

08:46.818 --> 08:49.241
Sounds like they talked
some sense into you.

08:49.237 --> 08:50.864
They sure did.

08:50.864 --> 08:52.457
I'm gonna go clean my room now.

08:52.449 --> 08:55.703
You can't be pure of heart
if you're not pure of room.

08:55.702 --> 08:57.830
Good night and God bless.

09:03.460 --> 09:06.509
Peggy, just to make sure
we out-do Heck Dorland,

09:06.504 --> 09:08.131
me and the guys are heading out

09:08.131 --> 09:10.384
to John Redcorn's
fireworks stand.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.101
Now, I know it's dangerous,

09:12.093 --> 09:14.846
but now is not the time
to play it safe.

09:14.846 --> 09:16.848
All right then.
Be careful.

09:16.848 --> 09:18.850
Mom, I'm gonna be home late.

09:18.850 --> 09:22.480
I got to spread the good word
and reach into the fires of hell

09:22.479 --> 09:23.776
with Jesus's oven mitts

09:23.772 --> 09:25.820
and save a few souls
from getting extra crispy!

09:25.982 --> 09:28.405
All right then.
Be careful.

09:35.784 --> 09:37.582
Dag nab it!

09:37.577 --> 09:40.205
Talk amongst it.

09:40.205 --> 09:42.082
What in the heck are you doing?

09:42.082 --> 09:43.880
Saving souls, sir.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.128
And I can see
yours is up for grabs.

09:46.127 --> 09:50.223
So why not repent
right here, right now?

09:50.215 --> 09:51.432
Get out of here, Bobby.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.426
If those kids could read,

09:53.426 --> 09:55.394
they'd be very upset.

09:58.223 --> 09:59.770
Here you go, sinner.

09:59.766 --> 10:01.518
This is for you, sinner.

10:01.518 --> 10:03.486
And one for you, sinner.

10:05.563 --> 10:06.735
Fornicator!

10:06.731 --> 10:08.859
You're all fornicators!

10:08.858 --> 10:10.360
And if you do not repent,

10:10.360 --> 10:13.239
you will face severe punishment
on judgment day!

10:13.238 --> 10:16.833
That's right, fornicators,
I'm talking to you!

10:19.244 --> 10:22.589
Who will join me
in the fountain?

10:22.580 --> 10:26.084
Come on, let us wash away
our sins.

10:28.044 --> 10:30.718
Don't shake your head at me,
sir.

10:30.713 --> 10:33.842
I can tell from here that you
are a for--

10:33.842 --> 10:36.140
Attention, shoppers!

10:36.136 --> 10:39.390
You cannot buy salvation!

10:40.640 --> 10:42.859
These sparklers will blow
your mind, Hank.

10:42.851 --> 10:44.273
When you write in the air,

10:44.269 --> 10:47.648
the words will stay there
for almost a second.

10:47.647 --> 10:51.447
For the last time, John Redcorn,
I am not a narc.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.695
Now, I've got a stack of 20s

10:53.695 --> 10:55.697
and a tarp for the back
of my truck.

10:55.697 --> 10:56.914
Let's make this happen.

10:58.992 --> 11:00.585
Be careful.

11:00.577 --> 11:02.250
Some of these are illegal.

11:02.245 --> 11:03.462
In Mexico.

11:04.539 --> 11:07.258
Ooh!

11:07.250 --> 11:10.094
Boy, wait'll Heck Dorland
sees all this.

11:10.086 --> 11:13.306
Have you ever seen a grown
man cry besides Bill?

11:13.298 --> 11:14.845
Well, you're about to.

11:14.841 --> 11:18.812
Uh... I guess we've all
seen Dale cry, too.

11:19.846 --> 11:21.689
All right, here we go.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.649
Get ready for some taunting.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.155
Hey, Heck,

11:33.151 --> 11:34.869
we just wanted to
invite you over

11:34.861 --> 11:36.863
for a real fireworks display.

11:36.863 --> 11:38.536
You're gonna see it
from here anyway,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.454
you may as well have
a front row seat.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.875
Well, thanks, Hank, I'd love to
see your little sparkler show,

11:43.870 --> 11:45.463
but I'll have my
flame-resistant,

11:45.455 --> 11:47.332
Kevlar-protected hands full.

11:47.332 --> 11:49.380
Oh, and, uh, dibs on the alley--

11:49.375 --> 11:51.093
I'm gonna need room
for a cherry picker

11:51.085 --> 11:52.883
and two forklifts.

11:52.879 --> 11:53.880
Cherry picker?!

11:53.880 --> 11:54.802
Damn it!

12:01.304 --> 12:04.308
What can we do to top Heck
Dorland's cherry picker?

12:04.307 --> 12:07.311
We need one of those inflatable
things that, that goes like...

12:09.854 --> 12:11.856
I've been saving these plans

12:11.856 --> 12:14.029
for our nation's
sesqui-bicentennial.

12:14.025 --> 12:16.995
But dang it,
we're in a crisis situation.

12:48.768 --> 12:52.568
Hank Hill, is there anything
you cannot do in this garage?

12:52.563 --> 12:54.110
Yep, I know what I've said

12:54.107 --> 12:56.109
about papier-mâché
in the past,

12:56.109 --> 12:59.158
but for my country
and to shut up Milton Street,

12:59.153 --> 13:02.202
I was willing
to put my contempt aside.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.084
Lucky's church was great!

13:05.076 --> 13:07.078
We pulled down the devil's pants

13:07.078 --> 13:09.080
and spanked his evil red butt.

13:09.080 --> 13:11.082
How was your church, Dad?

13:11.082 --> 13:13.710
Well, I didn't make it
to services this morning, Bobby.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.303
I was kinda busy here.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.594
You chose Uncle Sam

13:18.589 --> 13:21.468
over worshipping our Lord
and Savior?

13:21.467 --> 13:23.435
Interesting.

13:35.857 --> 13:38.406
Lord, please forgive my dad

13:38.401 --> 13:40.449
for worshipping false idols.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.493
Amen.

13:42.488 --> 13:46.413
I smite thee in the name
of the Lord!

13:50.246 --> 13:51.463
Well, it's getting windy.

13:51.456 --> 13:53.709
I better go make sure
Uncle Sam's head

13:53.708 --> 13:55.676
isn't exposed to the elements.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.064
Oh, Hank.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.059
Uncle Sam is gone, Peggy.

14:11.059 --> 14:12.857
He's... he's gone.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.479
It's okay, Dad,

14:14.479 --> 14:15.856
this is a good thing.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.152
You're free now.

14:17.148 --> 14:19.367
Who could have done
such a heinous thing?

14:19.359 --> 14:22.158
Don't you mean righteous?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.245
I know who.

14:23.237 --> 14:24.409
Heck Dorland.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.874
And he is gonna have hell
to pay.

14:26.866 --> 14:30.871
That bastard fireman and
everyone else on Milton Street.

14:30.870 --> 14:32.838
This means war.

14:43.341 --> 14:46.311
Can I have
everyone's attention?

14:46.302 --> 14:49.146
Now, this is all that remains
of Uncle Sam.

14:50.556 --> 14:51.853
But it's enough to see

14:51.849 --> 14:54.523
that the people of Milton Street
are barbarians.

14:54.519 --> 14:57.864
And now,
though I'm reluctant to do so,

14:57.855 --> 15:02.201
I'm turning it over to Dale,
an expert in counterattacks.

15:07.031 --> 15:11.036
I have identified three Milton
Street targets

15:11.035 --> 15:14.881
we need to hit to disable
their July Fourth celebration.

15:14.872 --> 15:18.718
Heck has stored the Milton
decorations here,

15:18.709 --> 15:20.427
the food here,

15:20.420 --> 15:22.843
and their fireworks here.

15:22.839 --> 15:25.718
And not to worry,
our own fireworks are safe.

15:25.716 --> 15:27.184
Yep. At this very moment

15:27.176 --> 15:29.804
they are on an 18-wheeler,
heading northwest

15:29.971 --> 15:31.814
at approximately
90 miles an hour.

15:31.973 --> 15:33.816
They're in Kahn's shed.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.818
So you didn't go with
my plan, then?

15:35.977 --> 15:37.024
Dad?

15:37.019 --> 15:39.818
I have something important
to tell you.

15:39.814 --> 15:42.818
Unless it's something about Heck
Dorland, it can wait.

16:05.756 --> 16:07.133
What's all the ruckus?

16:07.133 --> 16:10.137
Hey, my twinkly lights
went missing.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.148
Rainey Street's been here!

16:15.266 --> 16:16.859
Are you sure he didn't see me?

16:16.851 --> 16:17.852
Heck's a fireman!

16:17.852 --> 16:19.320
If he can see through fire,

16:19.312 --> 16:20.859
he can probably see
through dark.

16:20.855 --> 16:23.324
There's no way they can
tie us to the crime.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.738
No got-dang way.

16:24.734 --> 16:25.701
Here.

16:26.861 --> 16:28.488
I recognize that head.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.206
That's Heck Dorland's cowlick!

16:30.198 --> 16:31.871
We've got to protect
our fireworks!

16:32.867 --> 16:33.868
No!

16:33.868 --> 16:36.838
Happy Fourth, suckers!

16:51.469 --> 16:54.643
Okay, we're gonna bombard
them with rotten eggs,

16:54.639 --> 16:57.062
fruit, incendiary
dog bombs--

16:57.058 --> 16:59.527
And sooner or later,
they'll take off to shower,

16:59.519 --> 17:01.613
leaving the shed exposed.

17:01.604 --> 17:03.698
I think it's great how our hate
for other people

17:03.689 --> 17:05.111
brings us together.

17:05.107 --> 17:07.155
I love you guys.

17:07.151 --> 17:08.528
Please help me.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.030
I'm trying to do your will,

17:10.029 --> 17:12.031
but I'm just making things
worse.

17:12.031 --> 17:15.079
I-Is that your will?

17:15.076 --> 17:17.078
C'mon, give me a sign!

17:17.078 --> 17:18.876
Anything!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.873
Yes!

17:20.873 --> 17:24.594
Wait, that's too vague,
I-I don't get it.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.587
Come on, Bobby,
your dad asked us

17:26.587 --> 17:29.591
to gather as much Ladybird poop
as we can find.

17:29.590 --> 17:32.013
We're moving out at 2100 hours.

17:32.009 --> 17:34.011
I don't know how many
o'clocks that is,

17:34.011 --> 17:36.264
but we'll figure it out
together.

17:36.264 --> 17:37.857
Lucky, you gotta help me.

17:37.848 --> 17:40.146
I'm the one
who destroyed Uncle Sam,

17:40.142 --> 17:42.190
not Milton Street.

17:42.186 --> 17:44.405
Oh, Bobby, that's bad.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.024
That's real bad.

17:46.023 --> 17:48.867
When I saw my dad going
off the righteous path

17:48.859 --> 17:51.863
I just wanted to keep him
from going to hell.

17:51.862 --> 17:53.330
You took the wrong message

17:53.322 --> 17:55.745
from what that preacher was
screaming at you.

17:55.741 --> 17:57.869
You shouldn't go
throwing rocks at others

17:57.868 --> 18:01.042
until you've thrown a bunch
of rocks at yourself.

18:01.038 --> 18:04.008
Ah, I guess you're right.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.879
Besides, saving souls
ain't your job.

18:06.877 --> 18:08.879
That position has been filled--

18:08.879 --> 18:10.847
In heaven by the Big Man,

18:10.840 --> 18:13.810
and on screen by Morgan Freeman.

18:22.018 --> 18:23.861
Load up'n 'em
dang ol' fruit, man.

18:23.853 --> 18:26.447
Dang ol' fire!

18:27.440 --> 18:28.657
Take cover!

18:28.649 --> 18:30.651
That's it, I'm showering.

18:30.651 --> 18:32.653
Done!

18:32.653 --> 18:36.533
Dang Rainey Streeters are full
to brimmin' with biodegradables.

18:36.532 --> 18:39.536
I may have to turn my fire
hose on those sons of bitches.

18:39.535 --> 18:40.878
Do it, Heck.
Just do it.

18:40.870 --> 18:42.872
You said-- you said it,
you must want to do it.

18:42.872 --> 18:44.874
Do it. Go on, do it.
Do it!

18:44.874 --> 18:46.876
I'm breakin' out the hose.

18:46.876 --> 18:48.253
We're doing it!

18:49.337 --> 18:52.090
They're down to two Miltonians!

18:52.089 --> 18:54.808
Come on, let's go steal
their fireworks!

18:57.470 --> 18:59.268
He's got a fire hose!
Get back!

19:05.936 --> 19:07.358
Wait!

19:07.355 --> 19:09.733
This is a call for peace.

19:09.732 --> 19:11.279
Hank, that's-that's
Bobby!

19:14.862 --> 19:16.705
Cease fire!

19:17.782 --> 19:18.829
It's just a boy!

19:18.991 --> 19:20.868
Milton Street, hold your fire!

19:20.868 --> 19:22.370
Hold your fire!

19:22.370 --> 19:25.590
Neighbors, you fight
a senseless war.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.879
Milton Street is innocent.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.721
I-I wrecked Uncle Sam,
and I worked alone.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.511
And I let you Milton guys
take the fall.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.351
For that, I am really sorry.

19:38.844 --> 19:43.645
July Fourth is supposed to be a
coming-together-style holiday.

19:43.641 --> 19:46.645
Sure, we may be
from different streets,

19:46.644 --> 19:49.648
but we all love the same things:

19:49.647 --> 19:51.649
fireworks, hot dogs,

19:51.649 --> 19:53.777
potato salad, fixin's.

19:53.943 --> 19:55.786
So let's focus on that--

19:55.945 --> 19:58.619
'cause America's having
a birthday tomorrow,

19:58.614 --> 20:00.662
and we're all invited!

20:07.748 --> 20:09.170
Dad, I'm sorry.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.588
It's okay, son.

20:10.584 --> 20:12.586
You did a stupid,
reckless thing,

20:12.586 --> 20:13.883
but you made it right.

20:13.879 --> 20:16.382
We raised a good boy, Hank.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.850
Yes, we did.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.391
A boy who's gonna continue
to do the right thing

20:20.386 --> 20:23.390
by cleaning up every
bit of this mess.

20:23.389 --> 20:24.811
Okay.

20:26.767 --> 20:27.814
What the...?!
Can't you see

20:27.977 --> 20:29.524
Bobby's a decoy?

20:29.520 --> 20:31.864
Long live Rainey Street!

20:31.856 --> 20:34.860
That was a direct hit
to my fireworks stash!

20:34.859 --> 20:36.236
Duck and cover!

20:36.235 --> 20:38.203
Let's get out of here!

20:49.123 --> 20:50.750
Happy Fourth, Hank.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.127
Uh, stopped by to see

20:52.126 --> 20:55.050
if y'all had any fireworks left.

21:04.638 --> 21:06.857
Happy Fourth!

21:06.849 --> 21:08.226
Where's that kid from?

21:08.225 --> 21:09.602
Applebee Street.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.855
Applebee sucks.

21:11.854 --> 21:13.822
Agreed.

21:52.061 --> 21:54.985
