_ [Pol/be Rad/'0 Chatter]

00:09.760 --> 00:11.625
[Chattering ]

00:11.762 --> 00:15.254
[ Booth ] Hey, what do we got?
[ Saroyan ]
Based on the desiccated tissue,

00:15.349 --> 00:17.510
I’d out time of death
at five to seven days.

00:17.602 --> 00:20.309
[ Booth ]
Nobody saw the car
drive up or anyone leave.

00:20.396 --> 00:22.603
That’s why criminals
like a vacant lot, I guess.

00:22.690 --> 00:25.432
Wow. Oh!
That’s a first.

00:25.526 --> 00:27.983
Okay, Bones, isn’t this guy
a little meaty for you?

00:28.070 --> 00:32.484
Actually, the only tissue
on the body is the flesh
that you can see.

00:32.575 --> 00:34.111
Sure excited, aren’t you?

00:34.202 --> 00:37.490
l have read about this,
but I have never
actually seen it.

00:37.580 --> 00:39.662
The remains decayed
in two different ways...

00:39.749 --> 00:42.536
because the body was exposed
to two different climates.

00:42.627 --> 00:44.868
What are you saying?
Like, he was moved here
from Florida?

00:44.962 --> 00:46.873
She’s referring
to microclimates.

00:46.964 --> 00:51.583
It occurs when there are two
radically different environments
in a surprisingly small area.

00:51.677 --> 00:55.169
[ Booth ] Well, there’s
rabbit ears in the pockets.
Shirt ripped open.

00:55.264 --> 00:57.755
Someone was looking
for something,
that’s for sure.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.512
— I’m guessing there’s no l.D.
- All we found is what you see.

01:00.603 --> 01:02.059
Huh. Cause of death?

01:02.146 --> 01:05.183
Well, it’s a little early,
but I’m not going with
natural causes.

01:05.274 --> 01:07.890
- [ Chuckles ]
You got that right.
- Well, of course she did.

01:07.985 --> 01:11.398
The likelihood of it being
anything other than murder
is remote.

01:11.489 --> 01:14.777
Okay,
what do we got here, huh?

01:14.867 --> 01:17.529
Toolbox, aerosol cans—
Oh—ho!

01:17.620 --> 01:20.532
Ladies and gentlemen,
jackpot

01:20.623 --> 01:22.739
Ah, a sawed—off shotgun.
That’s old—school.

01:22.833 --> 01:26.041
Old—school is right.
Winchester Model 12.

01:26.128 --> 01:28.084
Looks like the serial number
was filed off.

01:28.172 --> 01:30.538
— Hey, let’s dust this
for prints, okay?
— Got it.

01:30.633 --> 01:34.342
[ Brennan ]
The victim was shot at least
twice, not with a shotgun.

01:34.428 --> 01:37.920
The bullet shattered
the fifth and sixth ribs
on the right side.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.097
It looks like someone
dug out the slugs here...

01:40.184 --> 01:42.266
so we wouldn’t be able
to ID. them.

01:42.353 --> 01:44.844
Well, I know it’s early,
but I’m ruling out suicide.

01:44.939 --> 01:46.770
Suicide would be impossible...

01:46.857 --> 01:49.769
due to the trajectory of the bullet
through the costal cartilage.

01:49.860 --> 01:52.021
You’re right.
You’re absolutely right.
I’m wrong. Okay, let’s go.

01:52.113 --> 01:55.196
Let’s get the climate guy
back to the Jeffersonian.

01:55.324 --> 01:58.691
It was a joke, Bones.
Well, it wasn’t
particularly funny.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.744
We have Necrob/a ruf/pes,

02:02.832 --> 02:05.118
usually found
in cooler, dry climates,

02:05.209 --> 02:07.666
and cheese skippers
in the chest cavity...

02:07.753 --> 02:09.744
that are usually found
where it’s hot and humid.

02:09.880 --> 02:12.496
You’ve never seen them
living together before?
[ Device Beeps ]

02:12.591 --> 02:15.424
Never. I mean,
this is like Congress,
only functional.

02:15.511 --> 02:18.048
Hello, Dr. Brennan,
Dr. Hodgins.

02:18.139 --> 02:20.050
This is Andrew Jursic.

02:20.141 --> 02:22.883
We are in the middle
of an examination,
Dr. Saroyan.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.808
Oh. This is going well
akeady.

02:24.895 --> 02:28.023
Hey, I know you.
You’re a documentarian, right?

02:28.107 --> 02:30.063
Wars, killer animals.

02:30.151 --> 02:32.563
Oh, man, you are fearless.

02:32.653 --> 02:34.564
No, | just realized that...

02:34.655 --> 02:37.863
in a world without love, pain and death
are a foregone conclusion,

02:37.950 --> 02:40.111
so why fear
what you can’t control?

02:40.202 --> 02:44.036
Andrew’s been commissioned
to shoot a film to raise funds
for the Jeffersonian,

02:44.123 --> 02:47.115
so we are to give him access
to everything we do.

02:47.209 --> 02:50.372
—As long as he’s not in the way.
—Trust me, you won’t even know I’m here.

02:50.463 --> 02:51.999
- [ Beeps ]
— What are you doing?

02:52.089 --> 02:54.796
Oh, by, uh, wearing the camera,

02:54.884 --> 02:57.626
I give the audience
an immersive experience.

02:57.720 --> 02:59.961
The camera sees and feels
what I see and feel.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.679
Amazing.
No, it’s ridiculous.

03:02.767 --> 03:05.759
Cameras are inanimate objects.
They have no feelings.

03:05.853 --> 03:07.969
Well, this is gonna be
just great.

03:08.064 --> 03:10.521
How about we continue
with the examination?

03:10.608 --> 03:13.600
Yes. [ Clears Throat]
Dr. Jack Hodgins here.

03:13.694 --> 03:16.527
About to analyze insects
and particulates...

03:16.614 --> 03:20.778
to help solve this mysterious
and puzzling crime.

03:20.868 --> 03:24.577
And now Andrew
can get a good shot
of Dr. Brennan’s sidekick...

03:24.663 --> 03:27.700
analyzing the particulates
way over there.

03:27.792 --> 03:31.080
Uh, l’m—l’m not a sidekick.
l’m king of the lab.

03:31.212 --> 03:33.203
Of course you are.
But—

03:33.297 --> 03:36.164
You’re patronizing me.
l’m—l’m king of the lab.

03:36.258 --> 03:40.797
You should know that it is
myjob to direct the team
while solving a case.

03:40.888 --> 03:44.005
l’m clearly the protagonist
in your film.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.011
That’s kind of my call.

03:47.978 --> 03:50.435
The, uh, desiccated tissue...

03:50.523 --> 03:52.935
has totally distorted
the victim’s features.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.311
Removing it
in our normal manner...

03:55.403 --> 03:58.395
would slow down
making a facial reconstruction.

03:58.489 --> 04:03.358
Quickly identifying the victim
is one of the first and most
important things that I do.

04:03.452 --> 04:08.162
I will remove this abdominal tissue
so you can get to the bones.

04:09.417 --> 04:11.453
Okay.

04:20.845 --> 04:23.678
Ah, revolting.
I love it.

04:28.060 --> 04:31.393
Drug mule.
I did a film
on the Colombian cartels.

04:31.480 --> 04:33.766
Almost got beheaded.

04:33.858 --> 04:36.144
[ Saroyan ]
Drugs are certainly
a motive for murder.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.982
Oh. These aren’t drugs.

04:41.073 --> 04:42.188
Diamonds.

04:44.160 --> 04:45.900
Nice plot twist.

05:29.246 --> 05:30.656
Oh, boy.

05:30.748 --> 05:34.115
His features are too distorted for me
to get an accurate sketch.

05:34.210 --> 05:37.452
I’d have to fill in too many variables
for it to be usable.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.253
Well, I’m trying to fix that
for you right now.

05:40.341 --> 05:44.380
This is diluted
maceration fluid.

05:45.179 --> 05:46.794
Combined with radiant heat,

05:46.889 --> 05:50.723
it just might rehydrate
and soften his skin.

05:50.809 --> 05:53.095
You really are one of them,
you know that?

05:53.187 --> 05:56.520
— Them?
— The big brains who belong here.

05:56.607 --> 05:59.189
You just hide it.

05:59.276 --> 06:00.857
And you dress a lot better.

06:00.945 --> 06:03.527
I’m ready for my close—up.

06:03.614 --> 06:04.979
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

06:05.074 --> 06:07.235
Brennan thinks this film
is all about her.

06:07.326 --> 06:10.739
- Ah.
- The Jeffersonian board
asked for Dr. Edison.

06:10.829 --> 06:13.366
Another scientist is always
a valuable addition.

06:13.457 --> 06:16.369
And they thought it would also
be a good idea for me to, uh,

06:16.460 --> 06:18.746
temper Dr. Brennan’s
usual abrasive manner.

06:18.879 --> 06:20.961
Does Brennan know about this?
Know about what?

06:21.048 --> 06:22.549
Clark will be working...

06:22.633 --> 06:24.464
alongside Brennan for the film.

06:24.593 --> 06:26.379
Uh—oh.
Yeah.

06:26.512 --> 06:28.298
Dr. Hodgins, diamonds.
Yes.

06:28.389 --> 06:31.881
The diamonds
are all gem quality,

06:31.976 --> 06:34.683
valued at about 200 grand.

06:34.770 --> 06:37.887
They were all pried
from settings—

06:37.982 --> 06:39.893
rings, necklaces.

06:39.984 --> 06:41.474
So they were stolen.

06:46.574 --> 06:49.441
- Oh, my God!
— [ Gasps]

06:50.494 --> 06:52.280
[ Clark]
Why is this not being filmed?

06:52.371 --> 06:54.657
Am I missing something?

06:54.748 --> 06:56.158
Holy crap!

06:58.377 --> 07:01.039
You might want to start
snapping photos now, Angela.

07:01.130 --> 07:03.166
Who knows where
this is gonna go?

07:04.133 --> 07:06.294
[Shutter Clicking ]

07:10.014 --> 07:11.629
Oh, Seeley Booth.
Yeah?

07:11.724 --> 07:15.467
The VIN number and license plate
from the victim’s vehicle
came back stolen.

07:15.561 --> 07:19.474
That’s okay. We got a match
on Angela’s facial reconstruction.

07:19.607 --> 07:21.268
Quentin Coles?
Yep.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.942
Oh, here we go. Mr. Coles worked
as a security guard...

07:25.029 --> 07:28.863
for Oscar Schultz’s
Diamond Wholesalers.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.655
Right? I guess we now know...

07:30.743 --> 07:33.234
where, uh, he got the diamonds
that he swallowed.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.531
And he’s got a criminal record.
Right.

07:35.623 --> 07:38.285
You’d think a diamond merchant
hires a security guard,

07:38.375 --> 07:40.206
he does some kind of
background check.

07:40.294 --> 07:41.955
Tell you what, maybe
the diamond merchant...

07:42.046 --> 07:43.627
wanted a crooked security guard.

07:43.714 --> 07:45.796
- Birds of a feather—
— Flock together.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.169
Okay, also,
four of Oscar’s customers,

07:48.260 --> 07:50.376
last year, accused him...

07:50.512 --> 07:54.505
of swapping out their
real diamonds with glass
when they got their rings cleaned.

07:54.600 --> 07:58.058
Crooked security guard
steals already stolen diamonds—

07:58.145 --> 08:00.761
what can Oscar do
except take care of it himself?

08:00.856 --> 08:02.562
Exactly. Cheers to that.

08:03.609 --> 08:05.520
What are you doing
drinking coffee...

08:05.611 --> 08:07.522
when you should be questioning
Oscar Schultz...

08:07.613 --> 08:09.524
for the possible murder
of Quentin Coles?

08:09.615 --> 08:13.107
Sometimes you need a cup of
coffee to refresh yourself.

08:14.953 --> 08:17.820
That’s okay. You already ruined
my experience anyway. Thanks.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.163
Well, thanks for the coffee.
Right. Well,

08:20.250 --> 08:22.457
it’s two days old,
by the way.

08:22.544 --> 08:24.705
I love old things.

08:28.926 --> 08:30.666
Ah, Dr. Brennan.

08:30.761 --> 08:33.753
Mr. Jursic. Dr. Edison,
what are you doing here?

08:33.847 --> 08:35.678
Forensics is my domain.

08:35.766 --> 08:37.677
Historical anthropology
is yours.

08:37.768 --> 08:40.760
True, but the board
wanted me to, um—

08:44.191 --> 08:46.557
They wanted me to back up
your findings and perhaps...

08:46.652 --> 08:48.984
make them a bit more
presentable for the film.

08:49.071 --> 08:50.811
l’m capable of that.

08:50.906 --> 08:52.771
Look, people are gonna
want to give the kid money.

08:52.866 --> 08:54.572
You, I’m not so sure.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.696
- What are you—
— Why do you have a camera on your head?

08:56.787 --> 09:00.371
As the protagonist,
it makes sense that you’d want
shots from my point of view.

09:00.457 --> 09:03.620
Dr. Edison, please try
to provide information...

09:03.711 --> 09:06.919
that would give a donor
the confidence to donate.

09:07.005 --> 09:08.290
Uh—

09:08.382 --> 09:10.293
You see,
Hodgins just returned...

09:10.384 --> 09:12.090
the rib shards
from being swabbed,

09:12.177 --> 09:14.293
so I haven’t yet had a chance
to assemble them.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.255
There’s absolutely
no useful information
in what you just told me.

09:21.478 --> 09:25.391
[ Chuckles ]
Such a unique
sense of humor.

09:25.482 --> 09:26.733
But...

09:26.817 --> 09:31.356
the victim had extensive
remodeled, antemortem breaks.

09:31.447 --> 09:34.985
Note the blowout fracture
to the ocular orbit.

09:35.075 --> 09:37.066
Congruent with a punch.

09:37.161 --> 09:40.369
This wound to the sternum
could have come from a blade.

09:40.456 --> 09:43.789
Remodeling shows that
all of these injuries occurred
between two and five years ago.

09:43.876 --> 09:46.458
They have no bearing
on our immediate investigation.

09:47.171 --> 09:48.911
Based on striations,

09:49.006 --> 09:51.463
this injury to the ulna
deserves our attention.

09:51.550 --> 09:53.415
The bullet wound.

09:53.510 --> 09:55.922
Those who live by the sword...

09:56.013 --> 09:58.379
get shot by those who don’t.

09:59.266 --> 10:01.803
— Good one.
- Huh? Like it?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.426
Just off the top of my head.
That’s not even the saying.

10:04.563 --> 10:08.181
What?
Have Dr. Hodgins
swab for particulates.

10:09.860 --> 10:12.101
Kid, you are a natural.

10:12.196 --> 10:15.063
Ah!
[Chuckles]
Thanks, man. I got more.

10:17.910 --> 10:19.992
[ Man ]
Beautiful diamond
for a beautiful lady?

10:20.078 --> 10:24.196
No wedding band— I assume
this is for an engagement.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.618
Bones.
Uh, yes?

10:25.709 --> 10:27.791
Are you here to buy me
an engagement ring?

10:27.878 --> 10:29.834
Uh, no.

10:29.922 --> 10:31.583
My— My—

10:31.673 --> 10:32.924
Boyfriend.

10:33.008 --> 10:34.589
Boyfrien— Boyfriend? No.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.053
It seems weird to call
the father of my child “boyfriend.”

10:37.137 --> 10:38.172
Fiance?

10:38.305 --> 10:39.590
Bones?
Yes?

10:39.681 --> 10:41.387
Yes. Am | your fiance?

10:42.267 --> 10:43.518
No.

10:43.602 --> 10:47.311
Uh, we have a deal that he’ll
never ask me to marry him.

10:47.397 --> 10:48.898
Aha.

10:48.982 --> 10:52.816
When the time comes to marry,
which I do not foresee,

10:52.945 --> 10:55.482
he believes
that I will ask him.
Mm—hmm.

10:55.572 --> 10:58.860
Then keep these beauties
in mind, darling.

10:58.951 --> 11:00.691
No, no. We’re—We’re
not here for that.

11:00.786 --> 11:05.621
These are VS1, conflict—free
diamonds from Canada.

11:05.749 --> 11:07.740
Let’s get on with the show.
Oh.

11:08.836 --> 11:10.747
Look how shiny
that badge is.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.045
Yeah, that’s really shiny.
So, you’re Oscar Schultz?

11:13.131 --> 11:15.918
— Uh, yes. How can I help you?
- l’m F.B.l. Special Agent Seeley Booth.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.091
- This here is my partner—
— And girlfriend.

11:18.178 --> 11:20.294
Dr. Temperance Brennan.

11:20.389 --> 11:22.550
So, you know this man?

11:22.641 --> 11:24.256
|, uh— Oh.

11:25.811 --> 11:29.144
His name is Quentin Coles.
That’s all I’m gonna
tell you about him.

11:29.231 --> 11:30.220
Why?

11:30.315 --> 11:32.476
Don’t you people have
some kind of—

11:32.568 --> 11:34.559
I don’t know—
maybe some kind of alert?

11:34.653 --> 11:37.736
— Did Quentin Coles work here?
— Sort of.

11:37.823 --> 11:40.064
Sort of for how long,
sort of?

11:40.158 --> 11:43.446
Uh, lam really
not supposed to—

11:44.496 --> 11:46.327
[ Booth ]
These look familiar to you?

11:46.415 --> 11:49.202
— Damn, I neverthought
I’d see them again.
- They’re yours?

11:49.293 --> 11:51.500
Yes, but when Coles
took them, I—

11:51.587 --> 11:54.329
No, I shouldn’t
be saying anything.

11:54.423 --> 11:56.914
’Cause you’re hiding something.

11:57.009 --> 11:59.045
— I think so.
— You think so?

11:59.136 --> 12:01.718
Uh, l have to call the police.

12:01.805 --> 12:03.716
You have to check a card
to call 911?

12:03.807 --> 12:07.015
Excuse me. Let me see that.
I’ll make that phone call
for you, huh?

12:07.102 --> 12:09.764
Let’s see what’s really
going on here.

12:09.855 --> 12:11.720
Detective Dinco?

12:11.815 --> 12:14.101
Joe Dinco.
DC. Metro.

12:14.192 --> 12:16.353
Yeah, Joe. lt’s Booth.

12:16.445 --> 12:18.982
Yeah, well, I’m here
with a friend of yours,
Oscar Schultz.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.609
Seems like the two of you
have something in common.

12:21.700 --> 12:23.315
Right.

12:23.410 --> 12:25.651
Meet me in my office
in a half an hour.
[Beeps]

12:25.746 --> 12:27.486
I don’t understand.

12:27.581 --> 12:29.492
The victim
was an undercover cop.

12:39.009 --> 12:40.920
What happened
to his face?

12:41.011 --> 12:44.003
His body was in a hot car
for several days
before he was found.

12:44.139 --> 12:47.302
[Beeps]
Commander Dinco,
just to be clear,

12:47.392 --> 12:51.351
you are identifying
the man in these photos
as Quentin Coles, correct?

12:51.438 --> 12:53.850
His real name is
Detective Reuben Martin.

12:53.941 --> 12:56.728
Coles was
his undercover identity
we set up for him at Metro.

12:56.818 --> 12:59.855
I’m sorry, Joe.
I know how tough this is
to lose one of your own.

13:00.781 --> 13:03.113
Yeah. Thanks.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.943
- I wondered why I hadn’t
heard from him in a while.
- What was Reuben working on?

13:07.037 --> 13:10.279
He was closing in on a two-man
crew that’s been hitting A.T.M.s
throughout the city.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.831
So far, they made off with
about a million and a half.

13:14.169 --> 13:17.252
Look, why are you
and the US. Attorney
interested?

13:17.339 --> 13:19.876
I thought you were
handing this over to me.
This is a local D.C. matter.

13:19.967 --> 13:22.208
The vacant lot where
the detective was found...

13:22.302 --> 13:25.419
was federal land
that Senator Brazina
is trying to develop.

13:25.514 --> 13:28.506
An unsolved murder
on that property makes that
more difficult,

13:28.600 --> 13:30.215
so I got my marching orders.

13:30.310 --> 13:31.971
You understand, Cher.

13:32.062 --> 13:35.896
Agent Booth, you know me.
I run a good division.
I’ll find who did this.

13:35.983 --> 13:41.023
We just want to help. Okay?
When an officer goes down,
all of us are affected here.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.401
It’s no reflection on you, Joe.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.357
Yeah.

13:48.078 --> 13:49.739
Reuben was a good man.

13:49.830 --> 13:52.116
In eight years,
he never banged in sick.
He never dogged it.

13:52.207 --> 13:55.574
And you think these
cash machine clowns
were the ones who killed him?

13:55.669 --> 13:57.955
He was getting close.
That’s why he was working
at the jewelry store.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.662
They were buying diamonds
to wash the cash.

14:00.757 --> 14:02.873
Exactly. A.T.M. cash is traceable.

14:02.968 --> 14:05.175
When’d you lose track of him?

14:05.262 --> 14:06.877
Six days ago.

14:06.972 --> 14:09.930
- Did Reuben have any family?
- Just his wife, Lauren.

14:10.017 --> 14:12.633
Oh, my God.
I gotta call her.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.684
I’ll take care of that.
Don’t worry about it.

14:14.771 --> 14:17.604
And we have a shrink here
who handles that kind of stuff.

14:17.733 --> 14:21.271
— Joe, we also found, uh, diamonds
in Reuben’s stomach.
- What?

14:21.361 --> 14:23.818
Yeah, we’re thinking
he lifted the stones
from the store.

14:23.905 --> 14:27.193
— No, not Reuben.
— Wouldn’t be the first time
a cop got tempted...

14:27.284 --> 14:29.240
to treat himself
after looking at his paycheck.

14:29.327 --> 14:32.114
Reuben was clean.
Now look,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.821
I’ll work with you,
but you better
watch yourselves.

14:34.916 --> 14:39.125
— Reuben was my friend.
- I understand that,
but we have to ask.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.464
You would do
the same thing, Joe.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.922
Okay, this time, try to be
a little less stiff, Dr. Brennan.

14:48.013 --> 14:50.550
— Excuse me?
— You know, more, uh—

14:50.640 --> 14:52.892
more casual
and, uh, likable.

14:52.976 --> 14:55.183
Like, uh, Edison there.

14:55.270 --> 14:57.431
Let me take this, Tempe.

14:57.522 --> 14:59.774
As you can see,
the directionality...

14:59.858 --> 15:02.019
of the bone splintering
on the ribs...

15:02.110 --> 15:06.228
suggests that he was shot
twice in his torso...

15:06.323 --> 15:08.234
and once on the ulna.

15:08.325 --> 15:12.068
Yes, yes.
And all on the right side.

15:12.162 --> 15:15.529
The shot to the ulna appears
to have been a glancing blow,

15:15.624 --> 15:18.832
and the size of the wounds
indicate— This is absurd.

15:18.919 --> 15:21.410
Indicates that the shot
to the ribs...

15:21.505 --> 15:24.338
was made by
a large—caliber bullet.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.257
And the wound
to the ulna was from
a smaller—caliber bullet.

15:27.344 --> 15:29.630
[ Together]
The victim was shot
with two different guns.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.586
Okay, now that was genius.

15:31.723 --> 15:35.056
I actually am a genius.
Oh, wow.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.725
The swabs from
the glancing blow to the— Oh.

15:37.813 --> 15:39.349
Hello.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.476
The swabs from
the glancing blow
to the ulna...

15:42.567 --> 15:45.434
contain concrete aggregate,
traces of dried algae...

15:45.529 --> 15:48.020
and peregrine falcon feces.

15:48.115 --> 15:50.356
So the wound to the ulna...

15:50.450 --> 15:53.817
was the result of a ricochet
off of a concrete structure.

15:53.912 --> 15:55.777
The bullet transferred
the material...

15:55.872 --> 15:58.614
from the object it struck
to the victim’s ulna.

15:58.708 --> 16:00.619
Yes. Yes.

16:00.710 --> 16:02.450
Uh, can I get a camera too?

16:02.546 --> 16:05.583
Dr. Hodgins, solving a murder
is more important than a camera.

16:05.674 --> 16:08.461
And you’ll look better
on camera without
that thing on your head.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.588
Right.
[ Clears Throat]

16:10.679 --> 16:13.466
The algae is Enleromorpha,

16:13.557 --> 16:16.515
which is found in shallow water.

16:16.601 --> 16:21.595
And peregrine falcons
are quite rare,
so that must be a clue.

16:21.690 --> 16:24.807
Solving the case
is our business, Mr. Jursic.

16:24.901 --> 16:28.234
Uh, no, he’s—he’s actually,
uh, correct.

16:28.321 --> 16:30.607
[Jursic]
They’re not on the endangered
species list anymore,

16:30.699 --> 16:32.781
but they are still
being tracked.

16:32.868 --> 16:36.486
I did a little film
for Nat Geo called
Birds, Our F/Ighly Friends.

16:36.580 --> 16:40.619
[ Chuckles ]
The only local pair
of peregrine falcons...

16:40.709 --> 16:42.620
are nesting here,

16:42.711 --> 16:46.875
underneath
the Benjamin Banneker,
um, Memorial Bridge...

16:46.965 --> 16:49.047

16:51.386 --> 16:53.422
Smile, sweetheart.
This is good news.

16:54.514 --> 16:56.505
I’ll tell Booth.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.386
I’m not a sweetheart.

17:03.481 --> 17:05.517
We’re very sorry
for your loss,
Mrs. Martin.

17:05.609 --> 17:08.271
We’re gonna find out
who’s responsible
for your husband’s death.

17:08.820 --> 17:10.321
lt’s Dinco.

17:11.615 --> 17:13.526
Uh, why do you say that?

17:13.617 --> 17:16.575
Dinco kept promising
that the next case
would be his last.

17:16.661 --> 17:21.906
Always lured Reuben,
saying that there would
be a raise in it for him.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.412
The only person who ever
got a raise was Dinco,

17:24.502 --> 17:26.663
because of the work
that Reuben did.

17:26.755 --> 17:30.668
Well, the—the politics
of undercover work
can be very complicated.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.920
We just wanted a vacation.

17:33.011 --> 17:34.501

17:34.596 --> 17:36.006
Nothing big.

17:36.097 --> 17:38.839
You know, South Beach
for a couple weeks.

17:40.018 --> 17:42.179
But even if
we had the money,

17:42.270 --> 17:46.138
he couldn’t take the time
when he was working cases.

17:46.233 --> 17:48.144
And now—

17:48.818 --> 17:50.354
I’m sorry.

17:54.616 --> 17:57.028
He deserved a good life.

17:57.118 --> 17:59.404
We both did.

17:59.496 --> 18:02.033
We had all these plans
when we got married.

18:02.165 --> 18:04.702
Now they’re all gone.
I’m sorry. Here.

18:04.793 --> 18:08.752
Did, uh, Reuben discuss
his last case with you?

18:08.838 --> 18:11.090
Reuben never talked to me
about his cases.

18:11.174 --> 18:13.790
’Cause he didn’t want me
to worry.

18:15.387 --> 18:17.298
I don’t care
what anybody says.

18:18.348 --> 18:20.680
I don’t care
who pulled the trigger.

18:21.601 --> 18:23.842
Reuben is dead because of Dinco.

18:23.979 --> 18:25.389
All right.
Oh—

18:25.522 --> 18:29.140
It’s okay.
It’s gonna be all right, okay?
[ Sobbing ]

18:33.863 --> 18:35.569
Oh, there you are.

18:35.657 --> 18:39.115
I brought you the files
for the last two cases
Reuben Martin worked.

18:39.244 --> 18:41.530
Shouldn’t these go to Booth?
Booth has them.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.782
But they also show
where Martin lived then,

18:43.873 --> 18:46.785
and I thought
they might give you some
environmental hooey...

18:46.876 --> 18:48.867
that might show up
in his hair or teeth...

where the bullet actually hit.

20:34.692 --> 20:36.853
I wanted to make sure that
she knew that somebody cared,

a shoulder to cry on.

Oh.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.323
That’s a dead foot.

The shoe protected the tissue
from decomposition.

And based on

21:39.215 --> 21:42.707
and the histological
analysis of the osteons,

by a shotgun.

My guess— the shotgun
Booth found in Reuben’s S.U.V.

22:35.438 --> 22:37.929
We don’t guess.
We’re scientists.

22:38.024 --> 22:39.525
Of course not.

22:39.609 --> 22:43.227
But the particulates embedded
in Reuben’s arm place him at the bridge,

22:43.321 --> 22:46.313

l posit Reuben’s involvement
in this dismemberment.

34:08.964 --> 34:11.125
I’d like to speak
to my lawyer.

34:13.802 --> 34:15.793
Dr. Saroyan said
that you found something.

34:15.888 --> 34:17.970
Yes. Now look,
I double—checked everything,

34:18.057 --> 34:19.843
but the one thing
I did notice...

34:19.934 --> 34:23.722
is the area on the rib fragments
around the entry wounds...

34:23.812 --> 34:25.643
is a bit discolored.

34:39.536 --> 34:42.619
— You see this small
pockmarking on the bones?
— Yes.

34:42.706 --> 34:46.290
— lt’s stippling.
— Unburned gunpowder
seared into the bone.

34:46.377 --> 34:48.413
Very good, Dr. Edison.

34:48.504 --> 34:50.961
Where is Mr. Jursic?
This is a crucial moment
in the case.

34:51.048 --> 34:52.879
lbeHeve
he’s at the florist.

34:52.967 --> 34:56.255
I must admit,
I feel more comfortable
without him here.

34:56.345 --> 34:57.630
Me too.

34:57.721 --> 35:00.804
I thought you enjoyed
the limelight, Dr. Edison.

35:00.891 --> 35:02.722
l was wrong.

35:02.810 --> 35:04.801
I like the pure science.

35:04.895 --> 35:06.431
No distractions.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.353
As do I.

35:08.440 --> 35:10.726
[ Both Chuckle ]

35:10.859 --> 35:13.896
Have Dr. Hodgins
analyze the stippling.
Right away.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.651
I did not flee. All right?

35:18.742 --> 35:20.698
He identified himself as police,
and I put my hands up.

35:20.828 --> 35:22.443
So he pushed you
in that stairwell?
Yes.

35:22.579 --> 35:24.319
And beat you up
for no reason?
That’s correct.

35:24.415 --> 35:26.326
That’s a lie.

35:26.417 --> 35:28.408
You know how many stairwells
we have in this building?

35:28.502 --> 35:31.790
I’m not here.
I’m somewhere else,
not hearing or seeing any of this.

35:31.880 --> 35:34.292
Here’s an added bonus—
you know, our stairwells
are soundproof.

35:34.383 --> 35:37.875
— You could break your neck
trying to run away from me.
— I’m not trying to run away.

35:37.970 --> 35:42.384
Not yet. But you’re gonna
want to answer my questions
very carefully.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.348
Where’s the money?

35:45.436 --> 35:48.303
— What money?
- If you say “What money,”

35:48.397 --> 35:50.103
l’ll drag you
to the nearest stairwell.

35:50.190 --> 35:52.397
I’m in a totally
different place.

35:58.741 --> 36:00.697
A man with a shotgun
took all the money.

36:00.784 --> 36:02.775
A man with a shotgun.
Right.

36:04.496 --> 36:06.532
This man?

36:07.666 --> 36:09.577
Yes.

36:12.087 --> 36:14.339
He was police?

36:14.423 --> 36:16.334
You think I killed
a police officer?

36:16.425 --> 36:19.007
The thing about police
getting killed, we don’t stop
until we find the killer.

36:19.094 --> 36:21.426
I didn’t kill him.
We didn’t know he was a cop.

36:21.513 --> 36:25.256
He was— He was a fence.
He took all our money and
blew off my girlfriend’s foot.

36:25.351 --> 36:27.307
Where’d you get the cash?

36:28.520 --> 36:30.431
I don’t want to admit anything
that I shouldn’t.

36:30.522 --> 36:32.638
Listen to me very carefully.

36:32.733 --> 36:35.896
The next thing you admit to
is the difference between
life in prison...

36:35.986 --> 36:38.773
with no chance of parole...

36:38.864 --> 36:40.445
or 20 years.

36:42.785 --> 36:46.573
Twenty years is a long time,
but it’s not life.
Do you understand?

36:49.291 --> 36:50.747
Yes.
Yeah. Okay.

36:50.834 --> 36:53.291
So, what’s it gonna be?

36:56.548 --> 36:58.459
We stole the money from A.T.M.s.

36:58.550 --> 37:01.212
We were gonna get
the diamonds from him,

37:01.303 --> 37:02.918
smuggle them back
to Colombia,

37:03.013 --> 37:04.344
sell ’em.

37:04.431 --> 37:06.968
That’s how you were going to
launder the stolen money?

37:07.059 --> 37:09.516
We’re thieves,

37:10.145 --> 37:12.056
not killers.

37:12.147 --> 37:14.638
Especially not cop killers, man.

37:18.737 --> 37:21.149
[Sighs]

37:21.323 --> 37:24.190
So these are the results
of the materials
in the stippling.

37:24.284 --> 37:26.240
Gunpowder, as expected.

37:26.328 --> 37:28.740
But it also contained
leather particulates...

37:28.831 --> 37:32.995
and a tiny bit of aerosolized alcohol
that was mixed with jasmine.

37:34.002 --> 37:35.788
- Perfect.
- Why?

37:35.879 --> 37:39.872
Please do not insert
yourself into the film,
Mr. Jursic.

37:39.967 --> 37:42.629
— Go on, Dr. Hodgins.
- Right. Uh, so,

37:42.719 --> 37:45.176
the victim’s clothing
was made of cotton,

37:45.264 --> 37:49.007
and his belt, shoes and
the interior of the vehicle—
they were all synthetic.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.513
You’ve been
following this case.

37:52.604 --> 37:57.769
I’m sure you’re on the edge of
your seat wondering where that
leather and alcohol came from.

37:57.860 --> 38:02.479
— Yes, I am.
— Good. Then that will make
for an excellent film.

38:08.537 --> 38:12.155
So we recovered
the gun and the money
from the safe in your home.

38:12.249 --> 38:14.661
The gun matches
the one that was used
to kill your husband,

38:14.751 --> 38:19.495
and the serial numbers on the money
matches the stolen cash from the A.T.M.s.

38:19.590 --> 38:22.002
I never even knew
we had a safe.

38:22.092 --> 38:24.083
Reuben must have
kept it a secret.

38:24.178 --> 38:27.841
Secret. Okay, so you’re
saying that your husband
returned the gun...

38:27.931 --> 38:31.048
to your “secret safe”
after it was used
to murder him.

38:31.185 --> 38:34.143
Is that what you’re saying?
I’m saying
l—l don’t know anything.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.345
I’m gonna enjoy
prosecuting this one.

38:36.440 --> 38:40.058
Killing a police officer, honey—
that’s the death penalty.

38:41.403 --> 38:44.361
First you’ll have to prove
I did it to a judge and jury.

38:44.448 --> 38:48.032
Oh, we got proof. We got proof
that you fired that gun
inside your leather purse.

38:48.118 --> 38:49.699
We also know that the bullet...

38:49.786 --> 38:52.914
broke your bottle
of Acqua Nobile perfume
in your purse.

38:52.998 --> 38:56.490
Even that fine scent
can’t hide your real smell.
One woman’s opinion.

38:56.585 --> 38:59.167
Not only did you kill a cop,
but you killed a good man.

38:59.254 --> 39:02.621
You threatened to leave him
if he didn’t quit his job
as an undercover cop.

39:02.716 --> 39:05.924
— He stole those diamonds for her?
- He loved her, right?

39:06.011 --> 39:08.377
He gave up his whole career
for her, right?

39:08.472 --> 39:11.714
- But she still killed him.
— No accounting for love.

39:11.808 --> 39:14.515
Admit it.
He gave you what you wanted.
You didn’t want it anymore.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.594
I wanted it!

39:16.688 --> 39:19.100
| just didn’t want Reuben.

[Jursic Chuckles]
Ah, I like a woman
with an appetite.

39:47.928 --> 39:50.965
I like a man who knows
how to slake a thirst.
Mmm.

39:52.891 --> 39:54.882
Can we drop
all the ’40s lingo, cner?

39:54.977 --> 39:56.808
Yes, of course.

39:56.895 --> 39:59.227
I mean,
all the suggestive stuff
is fun, but—

39:59.314 --> 40:05.105
It did its job, and now here we are
in... your favorite restaurant?

40:05.195 --> 40:07.151
Who told you that?
Hodgins?

40:08.782 --> 40:11.774
It was Hodgins.
Just because I eat lunch
here every day...

40:11.868 --> 40:13.859
does not mean
it’s my favorite restaurant.

40:13.954 --> 40:17.663
Well, that’s good to hear,
because I know
some great places.

40:17.749 --> 40:21.162
Ethiopian, Cajun, of course.
We could go now.

40:21.253 --> 40:25.166
But, cner,
I already filled up on
french fries and mushroom caps.

40:25.257 --> 40:29.466
But maybe a nightcap
somewhere else?

40:29.553 --> 40:31.168
Ah.

40:31.263 --> 40:35.006

lt’s, uh, footage
from the fund—raising
documentary.

41:21.396 --> 41:24.729
Mr. Jursic refers to me
as “stern and imperious.”

No, you know,

41:45.879 --> 41:48.120
this was just a very
particularly stressful case.

41:48.215 --> 41:51.048
For you, because it was
a cop murder. Not for me.

41:51.134 --> 41:55.719
You know what, Bones? I think
when I’m upset, you’re upset,
because you’re sympathetic.

41:55.806 --> 41:57.467
Well, that would be empathetic.

41:57.557 --> 41:59.513
