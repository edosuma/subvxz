Crown. Final answer.

interesting about it?

- Oh, uh, it was interesting
'cause...

06:39.499 --> 06:42.668
It was made of chocolate?
- Chocolate?

an interrogation?!

16:46.638 --> 16:49.141
- Or maybe not. Next!

16:51.310 --> 16:53.479
- [giggling]

16:53.545 --> 16:55.914
{\an1}- Hey! That girl laughs
just like Luan!

16:55.981 --> 16:59.284
{\an1}She must be a Loud, and I must
belong in that family.

17:00.753 --> 17:02.888
Or maybe not. Next!

17:02.955 --> 17:06.692
{\an1}Maybe she's the one. She's into
dirt, just like Lana!

17:08.026 --> 17:09.560
Or not.

17:09.627 --> 17:12.498
{\an1}Ow! I hate these
drought-resistant lawns.

17:12.564 --> 17:14.066
{\an3}- I sure hope it's not
this house,

17:14.133 --> 17:15.867
because we'd be going
to different schools.

17:15.934 --> 17:18.170
{\an3}Just thinking about that
makes my feet sweat.

17:18.237 --> 17:19.905
[car horn honks]

17:19.972 --> 17:21.573
{\an1}- I wouldn't worry about it,
Clyde.

17:21.640 --> 17:23.776
With the luck we're having--

17:23.842 --> 17:26.512
Gah! The white hair!

17:26.578 --> 17:27.780
And look at her hair!

17:27.846 --> 17:30.082
It looks just like Lori's!

17:32.751 --> 17:34.386
{\an3}- What does everyone want
for dinner?

17:34.453 --> 17:36.155
- Spicy subs! Spicy subs!

17:36.221 --> 17:39.258
- Hair like Lori's, plays
guitar like Luna,

17:39.324 --> 17:40.526
eats like Lynn--

17:40.592 --> 17:41.860
that girl is a Loud!

17:41.927 --> 17:44.530
- We don't know that!

17:44.596 --> 17:46.632
{\an1}[sighs]

17:46.698 --> 17:48.167
- Let's face it, Clyde.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.736
{\an3}Those white-haired people
are my real parents.

17:50.803 --> 17:51.970
I'm gonna have to move here

17:52.037 --> 17:54.339
and start my life all over.

17:54.406 --> 17:57.276
- You can't! How are we
gonna stay best friends?

17:57.342 --> 17:59.344
Do walkie-talkies
even reach this far?

17:59.411 --> 18:01.647
Will your new parents
even let me sleep over?

18:01.713 --> 18:04.116
{\an1}[panting]

18:04.183 --> 18:06.218
{\an3}- Don't worry,
we'll work it out.

18:06.285 --> 18:10.322
{\an3}But first, I have some choice
words for my so-called parents.

18:10.389 --> 18:13.659
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

18:13.725 --> 18:14.760
[cracks neck]

18:14.827 --> 18:16.261
- Can we help you, son?

18:16.328 --> 18:19.665
- Son--that's an interesting
choice of words.

18:19.731 --> 18:21.200
- Yeah!

18:23.168 --> 18:24.703
{\an3}- Is there something wrong,
boys?

18:24.770 --> 18:27.372
- Yes.
I know my real birth story.

18:27.439 --> 18:28.674
- You do?!

18:28.740 --> 18:30.742
- Yep. You really
had another girl,

18:30.809 --> 18:33.378
but you didn't want another
girl, did you?

18:33.445 --> 18:35.514
You wanted a boyyyy!

18:35.581 --> 18:37.115
So what did you do?

18:37.182 --> 18:39.117
You paid off the hospital
to look the other way,

18:39.184 --> 18:41.453
then you made the ol'
switcheroo with some poor,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.255
{\an1}unsuspecting family
across town!

18:43.322 --> 18:45.424
What do you have to
say for yourselves?!

18:45.491 --> 18:47.659
- Yeah! For shame!

18:48.460 --> 18:50.162
[laughter]

18:50.229 --> 18:53.632
- Oh, I'm glad you find ruining
my life funny.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.934
[chortling]

18:58.837 --> 19:01.974
{\an3}- We're sorry, honey.
We don't mean to laugh.

19:02.040 --> 19:04.810
{\an3}It's just that you're way
off base.

19:04.877 --> 19:07.079
{\an1}- Oh, Lincoln,
of course you're our son.

19:07.145 --> 19:08.780
{\an1}Why don't you sit down?
It's time you know

19:08.847 --> 19:10.148
the real story of your birth.

19:11.817 --> 19:13.051
Okay, you too, Clyde.

19:13.118 --> 19:14.653
- Well, the day you were born

19:14.720 --> 19:16.622
{\an3}got off to a pretty
normal start.

19:16.688 --> 19:18.857
{\an3}My water broke,
we called Pop Pop,

19:18.924 --> 19:20.926
he came over to watch
your older sisters...

19:20.993 --> 19:22.794
- I drove your mother to
the hospital in Vanzilla,

19:22.861 --> 19:24.563
{\an1}but not surprisingly,
she broke down.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.298
{\an1}Uh, the van,
not your mother.

19:26.365 --> 19:28.433
And that's when things
stopped being normal...

19:28.500 --> 19:30.969
<i>- We were afraid you were</i>
<i>going to be born</i>

19:31.036 --> 19:32.571
<i>on the side of the road,</i>

19:32.638 --> 19:35.107
<i>but thankfully, a black limo</i>
<i>pulled up.</i>

19:35.173 --> 19:37.009
<i>- Could have knocked me over</i>
<i>with a feather--</i>

19:37.075 --> 19:38.677
<i>it was the President</i>
<i>and the First Lady!</i>

19:38.744 --> 19:40.345
<i>When I told them</i>
<i>what was going on,</i>

19:40.412 --> 19:42.915
<i>they offered to give us a ride</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

19:46.285 --> 19:47.986
<i>- Everything was looking</i>
<i>fine again,</i>

19:48.053 --> 19:50.389
<i>but you weren't a very</i>
<i>patient baby.</i>

19:50.455 --> 19:52.391
<i>We weren't going to make it</i>
<i>to the hospital.</i>

19:52.457 --> 19:54.726
<i>You were going to be</i>
<i>delivered by the President...</i>

19:54.793 --> 19:57.496
<i>Until he passed out.</i>

19:57.563 --> 19:59.364
<i>Then the First Lady took over.</i>

19:59.431 --> 20:00.832
- What an amazing woman.

20:00.899 --> 20:02.801
She was so cool under pressure.

20:02.868 --> 20:04.536
{\an3}- Of course, you had to hear
that from me,

20:04.603 --> 20:06.538
since you were passed out too.

20:06.605 --> 20:08.173
- That's not how I remember it.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.343
- Anyway, she delivered you
right there in the limo.

20:11.410 --> 20:13.779
When we saw you
for the first time...

20:13.845 --> 20:16.481
[sighs] Our hearts
just melted.

20:16.548 --> 20:19.451
{\an1}- The reason we never told you
was because the President--

20:19.518 --> 20:21.086
{\an1}[whispering] Because
the President was heading

20:21.153 --> 20:23.355
{\an1}to his top secret safehouse
in Royal Woods.

20:23.422 --> 20:25.457
{\an1}No one knows about it,
and no one can.

20:25.524 --> 20:29.661
- We had to sign an agreement
saying we'd never discuss it.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.363
- Wow! That's amazing!

20:31.430 --> 20:34.232
But wait, some things
still don't make sense.

20:34.299 --> 20:36.401
Luan said you decorated my room
for a girl.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.004
It sure sounds like you were
expecting one.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.906
- We already had five girls.

20:40.973 --> 20:43.208
We were just using the baby
stuff we had.

20:43.275 --> 20:45.544
What about the men in black
suits and sunglasses

20:45.611 --> 20:47.379
that Luna told me about?

20:47.446 --> 20:48.780
- They were secret service.

20:48.847 --> 20:50.382
- Lori said there
was a scientist

20:50.449 --> 20:51.617
in gloves and a mask--

20:51.683 --> 20:53.218
- That was the First Lady.

20:53.285 --> 20:54.920
{\an1}She got that stuff from
the first aid kit in the car.

20:54.987 --> 20:57.656
- Okay, but what about
what Leni said?

20:57.723 --> 20:59.358
That I was carried by an eagle?

20:59.424 --> 21:00.993
- Mm, you were wrapped
in a blanket

21:01.059 --> 21:03.161
with the presidential seal
on it.

21:03.228 --> 21:05.163
- In fact...

21:10.135 --> 21:12.738
- Holy cow!
I can't believe it!

21:12.804 --> 21:14.973
I was delivered
by the first lady!

21:15.040 --> 21:17.342
{\an3}- I believe she's referred to
as "FLOTUS."

21:17.409 --> 21:20.178
{\an3}Lincoln, wait until you tell
this story to our class!

21:20.245 --> 21:22.080
{\an3}It's gonna totally blow away
the story

21:22.147 --> 21:23.649
about Liam's water birth!

21:23.715 --> 21:26.218
- Sorry, sweetie, but you can't
tell your class.

21:26.284 --> 21:28.854
Remember, it's top secret.
- Oh, right.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.722
- Sorry about that, son.

21:30.789 --> 21:34.126
- It's okay, Dad. I'm just glad
you can still call me that.

21:34.192 --> 21:36.695
- Aww.
- Bring it in, kiddo.

21:36.762 --> 21:38.397
- [crying]

21:38.463 --> 21:41.133
It's just too beautiful.

21:42.534 --> 21:44.803
{\an1}- Uh, Clyde, that's a piece
of American history.

21:44.870 --> 21:46.505
{\an1}- It's great we know the truth,
Lincoln.

21:46.571 --> 21:49.074
{\an1}But we still haven't solved
the mystery of your white hair.

21:49.141 --> 21:51.643
- True. Wait a minute!

21:51.710 --> 21:54.613
I think I have the answer.

21:54.680 --> 21:55.747
- Of course!

21:55.814 --> 21:57.449
"Ron the Radioactive Boy"!

21:57.516 --> 22:00.085
His hair turned white after
that gamma ray explosion!

22:00.152 --> 22:04.489
{\an1}- But he also got all those
weird mutant abilities.

22:04.556 --> 22:05.857
Both: Field test!
