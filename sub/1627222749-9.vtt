it's gonna work out.

07:28.752 --> 07:31.276
- Kay, but why are we
on different teams?

07:31.320 --> 07:32.800
- Because in order
for this to work,

07:32.843 --> 07:34.976
we absolutely have to win
the first leg of the heist.

07:35.019 --> 07:36.238
It doubles our chances.

07:36.281 --> 07:37.631
- Got it, so basically

07:37.674 --> 07:39.284
we just have to keep Holt
from getting that tube.

07:39.328 --> 07:41.417
- Yes, indeed.

07:42.897 --> 07:43.941
I just realized we haven't
been alone without Mac

07:43.985 --> 07:45.552
for like three months.
- Desk?

07:45.595 --> 07:46.944
- Yep, let's do it.
- All right.

07:46.988 --> 07:49.077
- Enough talk.
I'm getting that tube.

07:49.120 --> 07:50.861
Where'd it go?
- That tube has been

07:50.905 --> 07:53.864
whisked off to a secret
location which only I know.

07:53.908 --> 07:56.127
And since I'm not competing,
I've agreed to help out.

07:56.171 --> 07:57.999
I designed the first part
of the heist

07:58.042 --> 08:00.697
to be a scavenger hunt
through memorable moments

08:00.741 --> 08:01.959
from the last eight years.

08:02.003 --> 08:03.613
It's a trip down memory lane.

08:03.657 --> 08:06.137
- Not a problem.
I have the memory of a--

08:06.181 --> 08:08.662
the thing with
the big nose and ears.

08:08.705 --> 08:09.967
- Prince Charles.
- No.

08:10.011 --> 08:11.839
- I hid five clues,
each leading to the next.

08:11.882 --> 08:13.754
And the last one
gets you the tube.

08:13.797 --> 08:16.408
The first clue
is under your chairs.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.585
- "Our fallen colleague
missing still..."

08:18.628 --> 08:20.500
- "His replacement
fits the bill..."

08:20.543 --> 08:22.327
- I can think of one colleague
who literally fell.

08:22.371 --> 08:23.503
We all watched it happen

08:23.546 --> 08:25.287
and then we ate
his sweet candy insides.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.680
- The vending machine!

08:26.723 --> 08:28.333
Is one theory,
probably incorrect.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.335
- Damn it, Charles.
Silent epiphany!

08:30.379 --> 08:32.642
- It's a new machine.
It's beautiful!

08:32.686 --> 08:34.339
- "His replacement
fits the bill."

08:34.383 --> 08:36.559
- The slots aren't labeled.
How do we know what to press?

08:36.603 --> 08:38.605
- Well, a vending machine code
is usually a letter followed

08:38.648 --> 08:40.911
by a double-digit number.
Jeffords is being sentimental.

08:40.955 --> 08:43.435
- [screams]
[glass shatters]

08:43.479 --> 08:44.741
- Holy [bleep].
- Got it.

08:44.785 --> 08:46.177
- For the record,
it was gonna be B-nine-nine.

08:46.221 --> 08:47.178
- Nobody cares.
My thing was better.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.353
"When a fellow needs a friend,

08:48.397 --> 08:50.268
it's what's on the inside
that counts."

08:50.312 --> 08:52.836
- "Fellow needs,"
like felonies.

08:52.880 --> 08:54.664
- "On the inside," like jail.

08:54.708 --> 08:57.580
- Your cannibal friend.
- Charles, I highly doubt--

08:57.624 --> 08:59.060
it's definitely that!
- Go!

08:59.103 --> 09:01.192
- For the record,
I'm not a cannibal anymore.

09:01.236 --> 09:03.543
My new passion
is needlepoint embroidery.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.022
Look at these.

09:05.066 --> 09:08.199
Two parrots in love.

09:08.243 --> 09:10.898
A turtle with a monocle
and a top hat.

09:10.941 --> 09:13.074
- Wow, it's so intricate.
How do you--

09:13.117 --> 09:15.032
- Ahh!
- Oh, no, no!

09:15.076 --> 09:16.599
- Okay, you got me.

09:16.643 --> 09:17.687
I was gonna eat you.

09:17.731 --> 09:18.906
That's still my thing.

09:18.949 --> 09:20.690
It's even affected
my needlepoint.

09:20.734 --> 09:23.563
Look at this. Liver.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.565
A heart.

09:25.608 --> 09:27.697
Butt.

09:27.741 --> 09:29.090
An arm.

09:29.133 --> 09:29.960
Mmm.

09:30.004 --> 09:31.483
Oh, and there's this one

09:31.527 --> 09:34.225
that your delicious-looking
lieutenant asked me to do.

09:34.269 --> 09:35.531
- The third clue.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.968
"Where the devil lies,
you'll find your prize."

09:38.012 --> 09:39.622
- Well...
[chuckles]

09:39.666 --> 09:41.102
I know where the devil lies.

09:41.145 --> 09:43.191
Wuntch's grave.
- Wow.

09:43.234 --> 09:44.801
Did Terry put up
a balloon arch

09:44.845 --> 09:46.237
just for the heist?
- No, that was me.

09:46.281 --> 09:47.761
I come every week
to install a fresh one.

09:47.804 --> 09:49.371
But enough chit-chat.
Let's dig her up.

09:49.414 --> 09:50.677
- I don't think
we wanna do that.

09:50.720 --> 09:51.939
- Why, are you scared
of what she'd look like?

09:51.982 --> 09:53.941
She's just a corpse
with worms for eyes,

09:53.984 --> 09:55.333
no different
than when she was alive.

09:55.377 --> 09:57.292
- Found it. Here.

09:57.335 --> 09:59.903
- "Don't tell me where the next
clue is hidden, tell me why."

09:59.947 --> 10:01.209
- "Tell me why."

10:01.252 --> 10:02.950
From that time Jake made
the perp sing that song.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.081
- Wait a minute,
you guys know about that?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.256
Were any of you actually there?

10:05.300 --> 10:06.780
- You've told us the story
many times.

10:06.823 --> 10:09.217
- And tried to recreate the
moment on several occasions.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.611
all:
♪ Working at the car wash

10:11.654 --> 10:14.352
- No, number two and five,
you're off key.

10:14.396 --> 10:16.224
Number three, you're coming in
way too early.

10:16.267 --> 10:18.313
I mean, what are we even
doing here, guys?

10:18.356 --> 10:20.010
So which one do you think
killed your family?

10:20.054 --> 10:21.490
Yeah, I got to stop
trying to recapture

10:21.533 --> 10:23.187
the magic of the original
and move on.

10:23.231 --> 10:25.363
Anyways, back to
the eighth annual heist.

10:25.407 --> 10:26.843
♪

10:26.887 --> 10:29.193
Oh, no! Janitor Dan
is erasing the clue!

10:29.237 --> 10:30.847
all: No!

10:30.891 --> 10:32.327
- Stop! Stop!

10:32.370 --> 10:34.242
- You're welcome.
- Damn it.

10:34.285 --> 10:36.070
I love that guy, he's so nice.

10:36.113 --> 10:37.854
Ruined the whole heist and
we can't even be mad at him.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.377
- Yeah, we gotta call Terry.
- Already on it.

10:39.421 --> 10:40.465
It's going
straight to voicemail.

10:40.509 --> 10:41.989
- No problem,
I actually installed

10:42.032 --> 10:43.817
malware on his phone
in case he started heisting.

10:43.860 --> 10:45.296
I have access to
his microphone and speaker.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.559
- So, Lieutenant Jeffords,
can you handle

10:47.603 --> 10:49.953
the increased responsibility
of being a captain?

10:49.997 --> 10:52.347
- I'm glad you asked.
I'm very responsible.

10:52.390 --> 10:54.479
- Terry! Terry!

10:54.523 --> 10:56.743
Terry, it's Jake and the squad
calling from your butt.

10:56.786 --> 10:58.396
Terry, Terry, Terry!

10:58.440 --> 10:59.833
- I'm sorry, what's happening?
- I didn't hear anything.

10:59.876 --> 11:01.182
- Terry, answer your butt.

11:01.225 --> 11:02.836
Answer your butt.
Answer your butt.

11:02.879 --> 11:04.968
Don't ignore your butt, Terry!

11:05.012 --> 11:06.143
Terry, come on,
it'll just take a second.

11:06.187 --> 11:07.318
We just need the final clue.

11:07.362 --> 11:09.364
- A perfect world,
a time of bliss,

11:09.407 --> 11:11.453
a loving and inspiring kiss.
- We can't hear you.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.542
Please speak directly
into your butt.

11:13.585 --> 11:14.848
- A perfect world,

11:14.891 --> 11:17.198
a time of bliss,
a loving and inspiring kiss.

11:17.241 --> 11:19.766
- Wonderful!
Thank you, Terry, that is all.

11:19.809 --> 11:20.941
- "A loving
and inspiring kiss."

11:20.984 --> 11:22.203
That's gotta be Jake and Amy.

11:22.246 --> 11:23.813
And we know it's not
the last couple years

11:23.857 --> 11:25.815
because they've basically
stopped kissing in front of us.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.035
- All right. Wait a minute!

11:28.078 --> 11:29.776
"A Perfect World" is a movie
with Kevin Costner,

11:29.819 --> 11:31.603
or should I say Kevin Cozner.

11:31.647 --> 11:33.083
It's a kiss between
Holt and Kevin.

11:33.127 --> 11:34.302
- The one that
brought them back together.

11:34.345 --> 11:36.260
Out front in the rain!
- Ooh!

11:36.304 --> 11:37.740
- Well, looks like
it's gonna be

11:37.784 --> 11:39.524
a sprint out of the elevator.
- This is unfortunate.

11:39.568 --> 11:40.874
I didn't want to have
to reveal it this early.

11:40.917 --> 11:41.875
- Reveal what this early?

11:41.918 --> 11:43.659
- My most precious secret.

11:43.703 --> 11:45.139
My tattoo!

11:45.792 --> 11:48.795
- [gasps]
What am I looking at?

11:48.838 --> 11:50.231
- Is that what I think it is?

11:50.274 --> 11:53.364
- Kevin's human head
on Cheddar's dog body?

11:53.408 --> 11:55.279
- I asked for a tattoo
of Kevin and Cheddar.

11:55.323 --> 11:56.846
I don't know why
he combined them.

11:56.890 --> 11:58.979
- It's--it's--

11:59.022 --> 12:00.632
- It's the ultimate
distraction.

12:00.676 --> 12:01.808
- No, wait, wait!

12:01.851 --> 12:03.723
- Sorry, but you're too late.

12:03.766 --> 12:04.941
The tube is mine.

12:04.985 --> 12:06.987
Wait, it's empty.
Where'd it go?

12:07.030 --> 12:10.338
- You looking for this?

12:10.381 --> 12:11.600
Surprise reveal.

12:11.643 --> 12:12.601
all: Gina?

12:12.644 --> 12:14.951
- [evil laughter]

12:17.040 --> 12:17.432
.

12:17.475 --> 12:19.390
- Well, well, well.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.566
You thought you could have
a final heist without me?

12:21.610 --> 12:23.394
- I texted you about it
like 50 times.

12:23.438 --> 12:24.787
- Yeah, but, Jake,
I'm important now.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.354
So if you want to reach me,
you should call into

12:26.397 --> 12:27.572
"Watch What Happens Live."

12:27.616 --> 12:29.357
Andy Cohen always
knows where I am, okay?

12:29.400 --> 12:31.359
Anyhoo,
I'm gonna keep this safe

12:31.402 --> 12:33.970
by driving it around
in this hot little mama.

12:34.014 --> 12:35.189
- You rented an armored truck?

12:35.232 --> 12:36.407
- No, I bought it.

12:36.451 --> 12:37.974
It felt like it was great
for the heist

12:38.018 --> 12:39.715
and it's also just
such a wonderful way

12:39.759 --> 12:41.499
to flex on you guys
how rich I am now.

12:41.543 --> 12:43.763
I'm all about Salmons.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.155
Salmon.
You don't know about

12:45.199 --> 12:46.548
the $10,000 bill
that has a picture

12:46.591 --> 12:48.506
of Salmon P. Chase on it?
He's like--

12:48.550 --> 12:49.812
It's sad you were
unaware of that.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.379
Oh, my gosh,
this is embarrassing

12:51.422 --> 12:53.250
for all you broke bums.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.817
Okay.

12:54.861 --> 12:57.733
You're gonna regret
the day you fired me.

12:57.777 --> 12:59.387
- You left of
your own volition!

12:59.430 --> 13:01.171
We each spent
meaningful time with you!

13:01.215 --> 13:04.261
We were incredibly supportive!

13:04.305 --> 13:05.567
- Thank you for considering me.

13:05.610 --> 13:07.525
Again, I'm sorry about
that interruption.

13:07.569 --> 13:09.832
I know the heist seems crazy.
- No, no, no.

13:09.876 --> 13:11.703
In a difficult job,
it's vital to give people

13:11.747 --> 13:13.444
a chance to blow off
some steam.

13:13.488 --> 13:15.098
That's just good leadership.
- Wow!

13:15.142 --> 13:16.534
I was sure you'd be angry.

13:16.578 --> 13:19.320
I figured this interview
was over.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.887
What?

13:20.930 --> 13:22.279
There's a price tag
on this chair.

13:22.323 --> 13:24.064
- Oh, well, I must have
forgotten to take it off.

13:24.107 --> 13:25.456
It's a recent purchase.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.371
You should know, Jeffords,
I want to keep you here.

13:27.415 --> 13:29.591
- You want to keep me here?

13:29.634 --> 13:31.680
- Yes, at the NYPD.

13:31.723 --> 13:33.595
- Hmm.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.294
Wait a minute.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.948
There's no light bulb
in this lamp.

13:40.689 --> 13:42.909
This computer
isn't even plugged in.

13:42.952 --> 13:44.998
And there is no light

13:45.041 --> 13:46.869
coming from this window.

13:46.913 --> 13:48.566
Son of a bitch!

13:48.610 --> 13:50.177
This is a fake office.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.743
It's all part of the heist!

13:51.787 --> 13:53.136
- Oh, Jake,
what do we do now?

13:53.180 --> 13:55.051
- Obviously, our plans
have changed a little,

13:55.095 --> 13:56.705
but the perfect goodbye
is still in our sights.

13:56.748 --> 13:57.880
Our objective is the same.

13:57.924 --> 13:59.664
Get that tube from Gina
before Holt does.

13:59.708 --> 14:01.797
- How do we break into
an armored truck?

14:03.016 --> 14:04.800
- What are you two doing?
- Oh, sorry,

14:04.844 --> 14:06.541
Mac's done with daycare
so we had the babysitter

14:06.584 --> 14:07.934
bring him by
so we could say hi.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.805
'Cause we're gonna be home
late tonight, so--

14:09.849 --> 14:12.634
- Yeah, just trying to strike
that heist-life balance.

14:12.677 --> 14:14.462
Isn't that right,
little Mac-a-docious?

14:14.505 --> 14:16.159
Isn't that right, Mac-a-roonie?
- Yeah.

14:16.203 --> 14:17.639
- Ugh.
- Yeah!

14:17.682 --> 14:18.814
- Well, when you're done,
come find me.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.903
We gotta talk strategy.
- Got it.

14:20.947 --> 14:22.426
- I can't believe
she fell for it.

14:22.470 --> 14:23.819
- So, I don't understand,

14:23.863 --> 14:25.647
you guys are paying me
to babysit a fake baby?

14:25.690 --> 14:27.431
- Yeah, we're just hoping
people think it's real.

14:27.475 --> 14:28.650
- Oh, cool.

14:28.693 --> 14:29.956
You think it's working?
- I do not.

14:29.999 --> 14:32.915
