WEBVTT

01:07.583 --> 01:09.791
I can't hear you.

01:11.791 --> 01:12.791
Louder.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.375
<i>Louder!</i>

01:25.291 --> 01:26.708
That's all for now.

01:27.833 --> 01:29.083
Signing off.

01:29.625 --> 01:32.083
From your Desiree.

02:08.000 --> 02:10.250
She didn't expect
to die that night.

02:10.958 --> 02:16.125
Sara Bowman was precise about everything,
and dying wasn't on her schedule.

02:16.208 --> 02:20.375
She had no enemies that she knew of.

02:21.291 --> 02:24.375
All in all,
her life was pretty unremarkable.

02:24.916 --> 02:29.416
Yet there she was,
lying in a pool of her own blood.

02:29.500 --> 02:35.000
The manner of her death violent,
unhinged even.

02:35.083 --> 02:39.875
Who would want to kill
the altogether unremarkable Sara Bowman?

02:39.958 --> 02:41.166
And then it hit her.

02:41.250 --> 02:46.583
What if she wasn't unremarkable?
What if she had a secret life?

02:47.666 --> 02:48.750
Don't we all?

02:49.333 --> 02:53.750
But for some, the secret is a lot darker
and a lot more dangerous.

02:53.833 --> 02:57.708
And that's when Detective Stanton
started to dig,

02:57.791 --> 03:01.333
because whoever reduced Sara Bowman
to a bloody pulp

03:01.416 --> 03:05.625
might be as unremarkable as she was.

03:05.708 --> 03:07.708


03:08.291 --> 03:09.291
Thank you.

03:13.500 --> 03:16.291
That's the best turnout
we've had all year.

03:16.375 --> 03:19.083
-Keep writing, Grace Miller.
-I couldn't stop if I tried.

03:19.166 --> 03:20.000
You're the best.

03:20.083 --> 03:21.458
-Thank you.

03:26.708 --> 03:27.791
Kathleen?

03:28.750 --> 03:30.708
I'll be there on the next flight.

03:31.708 --> 03:34.583
Uh, change of plans. Family.

03:34.666 --> 03:36.125


03:36.875 --> 03:38.708
Take me to the airport, please.

04:02.708 --> 04:03.666
Hi.

04:04.583 --> 04:06.333
-Hi.
-Hi.

04:09.375 --> 04:13.083
Um… I didn't expect you to come so soon.

04:13.166 --> 04:14.916
You told me it was urgent.

04:15.625 --> 04:17.791
Yeah. Are you staying?

04:17.875 --> 04:20.208
I don't know. Am I?

04:20.291 --> 04:24.125
I-- Yes. Of-- Yeah. Come in.

04:24.208 --> 04:25.208
Okay.

04:28.083 --> 04:33.083
Wow. The old place
looks a lot like the old place.

04:36.083 --> 04:38.916
Oh, the plays
that we used to put on in here.

04:40.041 --> 04:42.416
We'd invite all the neighborhood kids,
remember?

04:42.500 --> 04:45.750
You wrote the plays, Grace.
I just made the popcorn.

04:46.250 --> 04:47.250
Coffee?

04:47.958 --> 04:48.875
Wine?

04:50.125 --> 04:51.208
Yeah.

04:51.708 --> 04:55.041
So, why did you leave him?
Was there someone else?

04:56.000 --> 04:59.083
You don't think I could
come to that realization on my own?

04:59.625 --> 05:01.375
-Here, give me that.
-No, I got it.

05:01.458 --> 05:02.666
Just give it to me. Thank you.

05:05.291 --> 05:08.083
Um, Kath, why am I here?

05:08.666 --> 05:11.083
I mean, seriously, are you okay?

05:11.166 --> 05:13.958
I mean, do you need anything?
Do you need money?

05:14.041 --> 05:15.875
That would explain the vintage.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.500
Oof. You never change.

05:18.583 --> 05:19.750
I haven't had to.

05:21.208 --> 05:22.833
Well, I have.

05:24.291 --> 05:26.000
And I'm good.

05:27.166 --> 05:28.541
And I'm getting better.

05:28.625 --> 05:30.791
That's great. That's great.

05:30.875 --> 05:34.083
Because the last I heard,
you were addicted to pills

05:34.166 --> 05:36.000
and you walked out on your son.

05:36.083 --> 05:39.833
Okay, no. I didn't have a choice.
When I asked for a divorce,

05:39.916 --> 05:43.625
Jonathan wanted me gone
and he wouldn't let me leave with Kevin.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.125
You always had a choice.

05:48.875 --> 05:49.833
I kicked the meds.

05:50.541 --> 05:51.791
-Great.
-Yup.

05:51.875 --> 05:54.250
And I put that degree
to good use and got a job.

05:54.333 --> 05:56.125
I teach high school.

05:56.208 --> 05:57.250
Drama and English.

05:57.333 --> 06:00.708
And… …I'm good at it.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.333
And now I'm going for custody of Kevin.

06:06.625 --> 06:09.083
I know that Jonathan's rich and connected.

06:11.416 --> 06:14.583
He's not gonna win this time.
I will not let him.

06:16.541 --> 06:20.208
He thinks that women are expendable
and that I'll just cave.

06:22.833 --> 06:24.166
I cannot.

06:35.000 --> 06:36.416
Medium tea, medium coffee.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.833
-Give me the money! Come on! Come on!
-Whoa, hey.

06:41.416 --> 06:44.208
-Pick it up! Move it, pick it up!

06:45.416 --> 06:47.958
-Gimme your wallet. Your phone.
-Okay. All right.

06:48.041 --> 06:48.875
Okay.

06:58.541 --> 06:59.791
No!

07:13.291 --> 07:16.083
-Easy.
-Hey, where's my coffee?

07:17.083 --> 07:18.458
Oh, got it. Thank you.

07:18.541 --> 07:21.750
Come on. Hi. Did he pay?

07:21.833 --> 07:24.041
-No.
-Oh, Christ.

07:24.125 --> 07:26.000
-He never pays for anything.
-Damn it.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.833
Trouble finds you, Detective.
That's all I'm saying.

07:28.916 --> 07:31.458
-I must be in the right job.
-Perhaps.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.041
Regardless, let's get you home.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.291
You got a week off.

07:35.375 --> 07:37.541
I can finally finish
renovating my kitchen.

07:37.625 --> 07:41.000
Mmm, on that,
uh, don't call me about tile samples.

07:41.083 --> 07:45.333
-You know you want to weigh in.
-I've already made your decision for you.

07:46.750 --> 07:49.708
Spanish tile. Case closed.

07:51.791 --> 07:53.166
We co-own the house,

07:53.250 --> 07:57.416
and I just need your approval
to get a mortgage on my half.

07:57.916 --> 08:00.666
-Is that gonna be enough?
-For legal fees, it'll help.

08:01.541 --> 08:04.291
I'm working on other things too, so…

08:06.958 --> 08:09.500
What kind of other things, Kathleen?

08:11.083 --> 08:15.750
Well, I have proof that Jonathan is
stealing from the family trust,

08:15.833 --> 08:18.250
and if that goes public, it'll ruin him.

08:18.333 --> 08:20.916
Kathleen, that's blackmail.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.750
Yeah. I'm sorry,
what makes you so pure all of a sudden?

08:23.833 --> 08:27.208
You make a fortune writing books
about women getting murdered.

08:27.291 --> 08:29.291
No, no, no.

08:30.750 --> 08:32.458
If you had read any of my books,

08:32.541 --> 08:36.375
you would know that they're about
the exploitation of women

08:36.458 --> 08:39.458
and misogyny and the patriarchy

08:39.541 --> 08:42.458
and how we do so very little
to protect the most vulnerable.

08:42.541 --> 08:44.208
Okay? So you do you.

08:44.291 --> 08:45.750
Okay. Grace.

09:11.166 --> 09:15.625
Grace, Jonathan's gonna try
to destroy me in court as the bad mother…

09:18.208 --> 09:21.541
hooked on pills, who abandoned her son.

09:23.625 --> 09:26.208
I'm so afraid I'm gonna lose him.

09:31.916 --> 09:33.791
I didn't even expect you to come.

09:33.875 --> 09:36.000
Well, of course I'm gonna come.

09:36.083 --> 09:39.250
We're sisters. If you need me, I'm here.

09:40.333 --> 09:43.708
A-Actually, I wanted you to need me
a whole lot sooner, but…

09:48.791 --> 09:49.625
Scoot over.

09:51.875 --> 09:53.625
-Okay, it's not--
-Scooch.

09:53.708 --> 09:56.916
-There's no thunder or lightning.
-Oh, isn't there though?

10:03.833 --> 10:06.000
Okay, well, don't hog the blanket.

10:07.541 --> 10:09.625
Old habits die hard.

10:12.791 --> 10:14.875
It's gonna be okay. It's okay.

10:16.250 --> 10:17.750
I'm so glad you're here.

10:18.666 --> 10:19.875
I'm right here.

11:41.291 --> 11:43.333
Hey! You with the saw!

11:44.125 --> 11:45.125
Morning.

11:46.625 --> 11:47.791
One more and I'm done.

11:47.875 --> 11:49.375
Measure twice.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.500
Cut once.

12:05.958 --> 12:06.958
Hi!

12:08.458 --> 12:09.958
-Hey.
-I hope you don't mind.

12:10.041 --> 12:11.500
Uh, the gate was wide open,

12:11.583 --> 12:14.000
so I just thought
I'd come over and say hi.

12:14.083 --> 12:17.666
I like your house. In another life,
I'd probably be flipping houses.

12:17.750 --> 12:19.875
Thanks. I'm not flipping it. It's mine.

12:19.958 --> 12:23.333
Really? It's my favorite house
on the block.

12:25.000 --> 12:27.666
Oh, um, I brought you coffee. Fresh.

12:27.750 --> 12:31.250
Thanks. Um, you know,
I… I quit caffeine.

12:32.250 --> 12:33.500
-Okay.

12:33.583 --> 12:38.000
So you are an un-caffeinated homeowner
with a miter saw.

12:38.083 --> 12:40.666
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, neighbor. Um.

12:40.750 --> 12:44.458
My sister lives next door.
Her name's Kathleen. Do you know her?

12:44.541 --> 12:47.291
Oh, yeah. Just to say hi.
Ed. Ed Jennings.

12:47.375 --> 12:48.958
Hi. Grace Miller.

12:51.250 --> 12:54.291
-Hold on a second. I'll be right back.
-Oh, okay.

13:08.583 --> 13:10.583
Oh.

13:10.666 --> 13:13.166
-Yeah? I thought that was you.
-Yeah.

13:13.250 --> 13:15.625
I see your picture
every time I pick up your books.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.791
I'd be happy to sign it for you
if you have a pen.

13:17.875 --> 13:21.000
-Right. That's a thing. Here you go.
-It is a thing.

13:21.083 --> 13:24.333
But maybe I should be asking
for your autograph,

13:24.416 --> 13:27.750
Detective Ed Jennings,
D.C. Police Homicide.

13:27.833 --> 13:30.666
-Are you stalking me?
-No, I'm Googling you.

13:30.750 --> 13:33.750
Uh, Detective Ed Jennings
who cracked a cold case

13:33.833 --> 13:37.083
and arrested the ex-husband
of the murdered woman.

13:37.916 --> 13:39.000
Wow. Congratulations.

13:39.583 --> 13:40.833
Just part of the job.

13:40.916 --> 13:43.333
Oh, take credit for it. You've earned it.

13:43.416 --> 13:45.708
What I earned is a week off.

13:45.791 --> 13:47.291
-A whole week off!
-Yeah, yeah.

13:47.375 --> 13:50.708
I was planning on learning
how to miter corners.

13:50.791 --> 13:54.083
Wow. And then maybe
we could figure out a murder.

13:54.625 --> 13:57.541
Fictional, right?
You're not going to kill anyone?

13:57.625 --> 13:58.958
I can't tell you that.

14:01.000 --> 14:05.083
Okay, so next week's essay is
going to be on <i>Hamlet</i>.

14:05.750 --> 14:09.875
How would Hamlet feel in our digital age?

14:09.958 --> 14:12.958
@HamletTheDane would love Twitter.

14:13.041 --> 14:15.750
To tweet or not to tweet,
that is the question.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.833
That's good. All right, that's your essay.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.166
Have a good day.

14:26.250 --> 14:28.000
Rand, don't be late with this one, okay?

14:30.125 --> 14:31.083
Hey, Rand. Hi.

14:32.333 --> 14:34.291
Did you hear what I said?
Don't be late.

14:37.541 --> 14:39.750
What are you doing? What is going on?

14:40.708 --> 14:44.291
You are normally a very good student
when you apply yourself.

14:44.375 --> 14:45.500
Lately…

14:48.166 --> 14:51.333
-Do you want to talk about anything?
-No. Don't be late.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.500
Got it.

15:02.458 --> 15:04.458
-Mrs. Breezewood--
-Grace, hi.

15:04.541 --> 15:05.458
<i> Hey, Kath.</i>

15:05.541 --> 15:06.458
Another time.

15:06.541 --> 15:09.708
<i>Uh, you know that cute</i>
<i>white embroidered top you have?</i>

15:09.791 --> 15:13.333
-It's sleeveless. Can I borrow it tonight?
-<i>Yeah, no, go for it.</i>

15:13.416 --> 15:14.375
You going somewhere?

15:14.458 --> 15:17.541
Oh, well, I met your neighbor
and I'm going to see him later,

15:17.625 --> 15:21.083
and he's homicide,
so obviously marriage made in heaven.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.666
You move fast.

15:22.750 --> 15:24.458
Just for consulting purposes.

15:24.541 --> 15:28.958
<i>Right. Well, why don't you marry him</i>
<i>and we could live next door to each other?</i>

15:29.458 --> 15:31.583
Hey, Kath, did you build a safe room?

15:32.875 --> 15:33.875
Um…

15:34.875 --> 15:39.083
Not exactly. I, um…
I'm gonna explain that later.

15:39.166 --> 15:42.666
But if you want to stay out tonight
and have a good time, please do.

15:42.750 --> 15:45.250
-I have papers to grade.
-No, no, no. You're cooking.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.500
You're the only Miller sister
that can cook.

15:47.583 --> 15:49.833
Okay. I'll see you later. Bye.

16:04.833 --> 16:06.083
Hi, honey.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.208
<i>Hi, Mommy.</i>

16:07.291 --> 16:09.541
-How are you?
-<i>Good.</i>

16:09.625 --> 16:12.583
Do you know what? Your Auntie Gracie
is staying here right now,

16:12.666 --> 16:15.125
and she can't wait to see you.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.041
<i>When?</i>

16:16.541 --> 16:20.625
-Um, when you come live here.
<i>-Okay, Kevin's gotta go. It's dinner time.</i>

16:20.708 --> 16:22.791
<i>-Say, "Bye-bye, Mommy."</i>
<i>-Bye-bye, Mommy.</i>

16:22.916 --> 16:24.583
Kevin-- Jonathan--

16:33.916 --> 16:35.000
Hello.

16:36.625 --> 16:39.958
Uh… no, tonight's not good.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.166
Okay. Ju-- Just the one, though.

17:20.791 --> 17:22.875
All right. Okay.

17:22.958 --> 17:24.916
-Let's review what we know.
-Okay.

17:25.416 --> 17:27.875
Cops break into a room.
Door's locked from the inside.

17:28.458 --> 17:31.666
-Windows are locked.
-Body in the middle of the room.

17:31.750 --> 17:32.666
-Male.
-Right.

17:32.750 --> 17:34.458
Gunshot wound, fatal.

17:34.958 --> 17:38.041
Now, we've ruled out suicide.
Angle of the shot.

17:38.125 --> 17:41.708
So, it's not about the why,
it's about the how.

17:41.791 --> 17:45.791
So, how did the killer get out of the room

17:45.875 --> 17:49.916
after murdering the victim
when the door was locked from inside?

17:50.000 --> 17:52.250
-That's a pretty devious plot you got.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.708
-Ah, ah…
-Hmm.

17:55.791 --> 17:57.708
-Some kind of evil force.

17:57.791 --> 18:00.916
-You mean like a ghost?
-Yeah, not really your thing.

18:01.000 --> 18:02.375
-No.
-Okay.

18:03.416 --> 18:04.791
Secret entrance.

18:05.458 --> 18:07.333
Like a trap door?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.416
We're sure he's dead?

18:15.791 --> 18:18.291
The coroner certified
the death certificate

18:18.375 --> 18:21.875
because he was bribed
by the so-called victim…

18:22.458 --> 18:24.125
-Yeah.
-…who was faking his death,

18:24.208 --> 18:25.541
and he is really alive!

18:27.000 --> 18:29.833
You're a little too happy about it,
but yes, finally.

18:32.250 --> 18:34.541
All right, the kitchen is a war zone.

18:36.458 --> 18:39.666
Fridge there, sink under the window.
Stove's going in here,

18:39.750 --> 18:44.250
and I'm trying to figure out
if an island will crowd the space.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.166
-Oh. Right here?
-Yeah.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.250
Hmm.

18:47.833 --> 18:50.541
-Should we take it for a test run?
-Yeah. What?

18:50.625 --> 18:52.000
Test run. You stand here.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.458
I'm at the island
chopping things right now.

18:57.541 --> 19:01.083
-E-Excuse me, can I have the frying pan?
-Sure.

19:01.166 --> 19:02.041
-Here.
-Thank you.

19:02.125 --> 19:04.750
And I have to put something
in the dishwasher.

19:05.333 --> 19:08.583
Ah, there was a dirty cup there.
Maybe you could get that for me.

19:09.166 --> 19:11.791
Seems a little crowding's got
its advantages.

19:17.375 --> 19:18.375
Say it.

19:20.208 --> 19:22.708
Say it louder. I can't hear you!

19:38.541 --> 19:41.083
-Good thing we recycle.

19:43.541 --> 19:45.625
-Uh-oh.
-Son of a…

19:47.625 --> 19:50.583
So, if you're gonna be here
for a couple more days…

19:50.666 --> 19:52.541
Uh-huh. I am.

19:53.291 --> 19:55.333
-And I will.
-Will what?

19:56.208 --> 19:57.333
Want to see you again.

19:58.000 --> 20:01.000
-It's that obvious?
-It's kind of obvious, yeah.

20:06.208 --> 20:08.041
Wait, let me see one more time.

20:09.666 --> 20:13.083
-Yeah. Mm-hmm. I want to see you again.
-Again. All right.

20:13.166 --> 20:15.916
-We had an incredible night.
-It was okay.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.875
-I had an incredible night.

20:19.708 --> 20:22.166
And let's do more.

20:22.916 --> 20:27.291
More of this,
but, you know, no expectations, just--

20:27.375 --> 20:30.750
Why not? You know,
I have a few expectations.

20:30.833 --> 20:32.416
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.458
But, Detective, I don't need
a police escort home. I'm okay.

20:36.541 --> 20:38.791
-Right. Okay.
-Yeah. Thank you, though.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.000
-Grace, look out!

20:42.083 --> 20:43.458
-Maybe I do.
-You might.

20:57.291 --> 20:58.458
Good night, Grace.

21:02.083 --> 21:03.083
Okay.

21:08.416 --> 21:09.250
Kath?

21:11.583 --> 21:12.916
I'm home!

21:14.208 --> 21:15.833
Kath, where are you?

21:15.916 --> 21:18.583
Oh my God.
I just had the best date ever.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.500
Kath?

21:24.958 --> 21:27.458
Kathleen? Kathleen?

21:28.708 --> 21:32.458
No, no. Oh my God.
Holy shit. Oh my God.

21:37.625 --> 21:38.625
Grace?

21:41.541 --> 21:45.625
Hey, Grace. Hey, I got you.
I got you. Come here. Come here.

21:46.166 --> 21:47.916
-Who's inside?

21:48.000 --> 21:51.000
Okay, okay. Stay here. Stay here.

22:05.625 --> 22:07.708
Stay back. Stay back.

22:09.166 --> 22:11.916
Please. Please.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.916
Please. Please. Please.

22:15.916 --> 22:17.000
Please.

22:46.375 --> 22:47.375
Grace?

22:47.875 --> 22:49.583
She was probably so scared.

22:49.666 --> 22:51.291
She was in there all alone.

22:53.291 --> 22:54.416
I wasn't with her.

22:54.916 --> 22:57.583
She's in there now. I'm not with her.

22:57.666 --> 23:00.125
You'll be with her soon. I promise.

23:00.625 --> 23:03.791
Just not now, okay?

23:05.375 --> 23:07.625
You know how it goes,
what needs to be done.

23:09.125 --> 23:10.208
This your case?

23:10.291 --> 23:14.208
No, I was first on the scene.
I live next door. Is this strangulation?

23:14.291 --> 23:15.916
Some kind of ligature.

23:32.375 --> 23:34.791
Dude, what are you doing here?

23:34.875 --> 23:36.000
Why am I here?

23:36.083 --> 23:37.708
We got a week off.

23:39.000 --> 23:39.875
I owe you.

23:39.958 --> 23:44.208
Oh no, no, no.
Uh, I haven't agreed to this yet.

23:44.291 --> 23:48.208
Ben, it happened next door
when Grace was with me. I owe it to her.

23:48.791 --> 23:50.666
You're owing a lot of people tonight.

23:50.750 --> 23:51.625
It's her sister.

23:51.708 --> 23:54.125
Wouldn't feel right
letting someone else work this.

23:54.208 --> 23:57.583
So we're supposed to get the captain
to assign this one to us

23:57.666 --> 24:00.250
because of some famous writer
that you just met.

24:00.333 --> 24:02.500
Right. They've taken
the statement from her.

24:02.583 --> 24:05.291
-She's with the body now.
-No, I'm still not in.

24:05.375 --> 24:08.333
You're always there for me.
You never let me down.

24:13.000 --> 24:13.916
You owe me.

24:17.833 --> 24:18.916
Have a seat.

24:27.166 --> 24:30.375
I'm… really sorry for your loss,
Ms. Miller,

24:30.458 --> 24:32.958
and I know that this is a difficult time,

24:33.041 --> 24:35.625
but we have to ask you a few questions.

24:37.791 --> 24:38.958
-Now--
-Here you go.

24:39.041 --> 24:39.875
Thank you.

24:40.583 --> 24:43.541
Did your sister ever mention
anyone threatening her?

24:43.625 --> 24:46.791
Anyone that you know
who might want to hurt her?

24:46.875 --> 24:50.458
Her ex-husband,
Jonathan Breezewood.

24:51.166 --> 24:52.916
Uh, what makes you say that?

24:53.000 --> 24:56.375
Because she was fighting
for full custody of their son.

24:57.375 --> 25:03.708
And she had evidence that he was involved
in… in some kind of fraud or something.

25:03.791 --> 25:04.833
I don't know.

25:04.916 --> 25:07.291
-Jonathan Breezewood?
-The third.

25:08.291 --> 25:13.875
His family's really connected and rich.
He's a big shot attorney.

25:18.708 --> 25:21.625
Did you know about your sister's clients?

25:23.125 --> 25:25.791
What are you talking about?
She was a teacher.

25:26.750 --> 25:32.208
She connected to clients via webcam.
The site was called Fantasy Inc.

25:33.083 --> 25:34.541
Oh my God.

25:35.375 --> 25:38.166
And from the looks
of the clothes we found,

25:38.250 --> 25:40.375
she was working as a dominatrix.

25:41.250 --> 25:42.833
I don't--

25:47.666 --> 25:49.250
Let's get you to a hotel.

25:50.916 --> 25:53.291
If you're uncomfortable being alone,

25:53.375 --> 25:55.500
we can have someone
stay there with you if you want.

25:55.583 --> 25:57.916
I don't want to be alone, and I don't…

26:01.750 --> 26:04.541
-We have people who--
-Can I stay at your place?

26:13.291 --> 26:16.125
<i>I mean,</i>
<i>I hadn't seen her for five years,</i>

26:16.208 --> 26:19.833
<i>and the first two minutes</i>
<i>I started a fight with her.</i>

26:19.916 --> 26:23.291
<i>The bedroom's under construction,</i>
<i>so take the couch. I'll take the chair.</i>

26:27.041 --> 26:28.375
Try to get some rest.

26:29.791 --> 26:31.208
Stop blaming yourself.

26:35.958 --> 26:36.958
Who else?

26:39.375 --> 26:40.458
The killer.

27:02.416 --> 27:03.416
Morning.

27:04.791 --> 27:05.833
Herbal tea?

27:07.708 --> 27:09.083
No coffee?

27:09.166 --> 27:10.625
Caffeine's the problem.

27:10.708 --> 27:12.125
Caffeine is the point.

27:16.333 --> 27:18.041
-Nope.

27:19.916 --> 27:21.833
You should try to ignore those.

27:21.916 --> 27:24.125
It's already all over
the news, social media.

27:24.208 --> 27:26.833
There's a couple news trucks
outside already.

27:26.916 --> 27:31.500
Listen. Uh, can we keep
what she was doing confidential?

27:31.583 --> 27:33.791
The least we can do
is protect her son from this part.

27:33.875 --> 27:34.750
Absolutely.

27:36.291 --> 27:40.166
And, uh… I want to help on the case.

27:40.250 --> 27:42.333
-Grace--
-No, no.

27:42.416 --> 27:45.833
I know this is not one of my books,
but this is personal.

27:45.916 --> 27:48.666
This is real and personal.
She is my sister.

27:48.750 --> 27:50.541
That's why you need to stay away from it.

27:50.625 --> 27:54.333
But we both know that the first 48 hours
are the most important.

27:54.416 --> 27:57.333
It's not your job to catch the killer,
it's mine, and I will get him,

27:57.416 --> 28:00.083
but you cannot put yourself in any danger.

28:00.166 --> 28:01.500
Can I… Can I go get my stuff?

28:01.583 --> 28:02.750
-I will get it.
-No, no, no.

28:02.833 --> 28:04.708
You don't know where to look.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.041
Forensics is gone, isn't it?

28:08.333 --> 28:11.166
Okay. You said
I know police protocol, so I'm gonna go.

28:11.250 --> 28:13.541
I will not contaminate anything.

28:14.875 --> 28:15.875
I promise.

28:16.833 --> 28:17.833
Okay.

28:23.583 --> 28:25.291
There she is.

28:25.375 --> 28:28.291
Grace, Grace, do you have
any comment for us? Grace!

28:28.375 --> 28:32.208
Detective Jennings, what about you?
Is this case similar to your last case?

28:32.291 --> 28:35.000
Is the ex-husband a suspect like before?

28:35.583 --> 28:37.000
Any comment at all?

28:58.083 --> 28:59.166
Jennings.

29:00.291 --> 29:01.291
Mm-hmm.

29:02.458 --> 29:04.000
Yeah, like 20 minutes ago.

29:28.000 --> 29:29.083
Grace?

29:30.541 --> 29:32.541
Have you spoken to her ex-husband?

29:33.166 --> 29:36.125
He was at home last night
hosting a political fundraiser.

29:36.208 --> 29:37.875
Maybe he had her killed.

29:39.166 --> 29:42.583
I mean, he's the likeliest suspect.
She was going to blackmail him.

29:44.166 --> 29:46.375
If he had her killed, we'll find out.

29:49.125 --> 29:50.708
And her… her body.

29:50.791 --> 29:55.000
She was, uh… She was twisted,
and her arms were out,

29:55.083 --> 29:59.833
and her… her feet were crossed
like she was on a cross.

29:59.916 --> 30:02.250
Is that… intentional?

30:03.583 --> 30:05.541
-Grace, we should go.
-How did she die?

30:07.333 --> 30:08.416
Please.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.250
Uh…

30:11.958 --> 30:14.833
He, uh, came in through the back door.

30:16.458 --> 30:18.916
Smashed a pane of glass.

30:21.125 --> 30:24.625
<i>Left a shoe print in the dirt.</i>
<i>Sneaker size 11.</i>

30:24.708 --> 30:27.000
No fingerprints. He was careful.

30:27.083 --> 30:28.250
Likely wore gloves.

30:28.333 --> 30:29.500
Did he steal anything?

30:30.208 --> 30:31.791
<i> Not that we could tell.</i>

30:33.500 --> 30:35.541
<i>So, he was really after her.</i>

30:39.208 --> 30:43.833
This is what you want.
Say it! Say it!

30:43.916 --> 30:48.083
Uh, she had marks on her neck, right?

30:48.166 --> 30:49.791
What… What did he use?

30:50.666 --> 30:52.000
We don't know yet.

31:14.291 --> 31:18.583
-That's all for now. Good night.

31:18.666 --> 31:20.875
<i>Did she have</i>
<i>any clients last night?</i>

31:21.500 --> 31:22.583
We're finding out.

31:23.291 --> 31:24.666
Is there a timeline?

31:26.500 --> 31:29.416
What we know is that she ran the shower,

31:30.250 --> 31:31.333
<i>but never got in.</i>

31:44.958 --> 31:46.125
Desiree.

31:48.208 --> 31:50.083
I saw bruises on her, uh…

31:51.666 --> 31:56.625
On her neck
and her… her chest and her arms.

32:25.208 --> 32:26.375
She fought him.

32:28.958 --> 32:30.333
Grace, we really should go.

32:37.333 --> 32:38.333
Okay.

32:46.583 --> 32:48.791
We were so sorry to hear about Kathleen.

32:48.875 --> 32:52.625
We didn't know her personally,
but she was a true professional.

32:56.541 --> 32:57.625
Gentlemen.

32:59.250 --> 33:03.916
Her character, Desiree, was becoming
very popular with some of our clients.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.791
Let's talk about those clients.

33:05.875 --> 33:08.166
Why? Do you think this has
something to do

33:08.250 --> 33:09.958
with the work she did for us?

33:10.041 --> 33:11.625
Let's focus on her client list.

33:11.708 --> 33:16.166
Well, I will tell you what I can,
but I'm sure there's no connection.

33:16.250 --> 33:19.458
For the most part,
her clients were out of the country.

33:19.541 --> 33:23.208
There's a significant percentage,
maybe 30%, within the U.S.

33:23.291 --> 33:25.333
Who, uh, has access to your, uh…

33:27.125 --> 33:28.083
Performers?

33:29.000 --> 33:31.041
We call them performers.
They're true artists.

33:31.625 --> 33:34.791
And who knows
the identity of your performers?

33:34.875 --> 33:39.083
Just me, my mother,
and my brother. It's a family business.

33:39.166 --> 33:41.375
Everything is within the law,

33:41.458 --> 33:43.291
and we have the highest standards

33:43.375 --> 33:47.875
when it comes to protecting the identities
of both our clients and our performers.

33:47.958 --> 33:50.416
-Do you record all the sessions?
-Yes, of course.

33:50.500 --> 33:54.000
For liability purposes
and creative reasons.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.833
Sometimes we give feedback.

33:55.916 --> 33:57.875
We're going to need
all of Desiree's sessions.

33:57.958 --> 33:59.958
Oh, and that list.

34:00.541 --> 34:01.708
Do you have a warrant?

34:02.250 --> 34:05.333
Yeah, we think of everything.

34:07.666 --> 34:10.250
So, how's our best-selling author today?

34:11.125 --> 34:12.416
I don't know, man.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.958
Really? What?
The, uh, bloom's off the rose?

34:15.041 --> 34:18.416
No rose, no bloom. I just tried--

34:18.500 --> 34:21.250
Yeah, to help her
make it through the night.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.458
You got something you want to say, Ben?

34:25.083 --> 34:26.083
Not really, Ed.

34:26.166 --> 34:30.250
Just that when you wade in,
you go hip-deep.

34:37.083 --> 34:39.791
<i>Sandy White Underwood,</i>
<i>principal of the academy.</i>

34:39.875 --> 34:42.291
Our heartfelt condolences.

34:42.375 --> 34:47.250
Kathleen was such a gifted teacher.
We're absolutely devastated by her loss.

34:48.041 --> 34:49.125
Thank you.

34:52.333 --> 34:57.333
Oh, it was supposed to be right here.
I'm sorry. I'll be right back. Excuse me.

35:31.875 --> 35:33.791
Sorry to bother you.

35:34.541 --> 35:38.250
We're so sorry.
We really loved Mrs. Breezewood.

35:38.333 --> 35:40.166
She wasn't like the others.

35:40.250 --> 35:42.208
You really wanted
to listen to her in class,

35:42.291 --> 35:45.625
and, like, she really got
how we were feeling.

35:46.541 --> 35:50.083
Yeah, she was hard on me,
but she was right.

35:52.291 --> 35:55.375
Thank you. Thank you all.

36:06.875 --> 36:10.666
Everything that was in her locker,
we put in this box.

36:12.166 --> 36:13.291
Thank you, Billy.

36:14.625 --> 36:18.750
I'll leave you alone.
Take your time, and if you need anything…

37:18.583 --> 37:19.583
Hey.

37:20.625 --> 37:24.375
-You're one of Kathleen's students.
-Mm-hmm. Jerald Baxter.

37:24.958 --> 37:28.083
I-- My mother's
Senator Baxter from Missouri.

37:28.166 --> 37:29.250
The Show-Me State.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.875
She… She won't let me say Missouri
without adding that.

37:35.750 --> 37:38.416
I'm really sorry about Kathleen.

37:38.500 --> 37:40.458
I mean, Mrs. Breezewood.

37:42.166 --> 37:43.666
How did she die?

37:45.125 --> 37:47.166
Sorry. Inappropriate. Um…

37:49.416 --> 37:51.333
Do the police have any suspects?

37:52.000 --> 37:53.000
I don't know.

37:53.958 --> 37:57.500
-I guess it could have been random.
-Most murders aren't.

37:58.083 --> 37:59.583
You mean someone wanted her dead?

37:59.666 --> 38:03.125
Well, I mean, that's a question
that the police are going to ask,

38:03.208 --> 38:05.458
and they're probably going to ask it here.

38:06.166 --> 38:07.791
Mr. Sachs got her upset.

38:07.875 --> 38:08.916
Who?

38:09.000 --> 38:11.583
He does maintenance. Billy Sachs.

38:12.750 --> 38:13.750
Thank you, Billy.

38:13.833 --> 38:17.958
I saw him talking to Mrs. Breezewood
the other day, and she looked upset.

38:18.041 --> 38:20.750
And I heard her
ask him not to tell anyone.

38:20.833 --> 38:22.166
She didn't mention it to me,

38:22.250 --> 38:25.041
so I can't imagine
she would be that upset.

38:25.125 --> 38:28.208
I wouldn't talk to anyone about this.
That's spreading rumors.

38:28.291 --> 38:29.833
Oh, uh, I'm sorry.

38:32.166 --> 38:33.583
I… I just thought…

38:34.083 --> 38:36.416
You know, in case it was useful.

39:02.500 --> 39:03.416
Hey.

39:04.916 --> 39:09.583
Listen, thank you so much for getting
my sister's stuff. I really appreciate it.

39:10.333 --> 39:12.375
Oh, it's been so hard to be here today.

39:12.458 --> 39:17.583
You know, seeing this life that she had,
how much her students adored her…

39:20.166 --> 39:21.291
She was so beautiful.

39:22.416 --> 39:26.041
She could have been on TV
with those looks, you know.

39:26.541 --> 39:30.916
And I don't know,
I guess in a way she kind of was.

39:33.041 --> 39:35.083
It's okay, Billy. I know that you know.

39:36.750 --> 39:39.666
I mean, everybody has secrets, right?

39:39.750 --> 39:40.583
Don't we?

39:41.916 --> 39:44.166
I told her I knew so she'd be careful.

39:44.250 --> 39:45.500
Well, that was kind.

39:46.208 --> 39:47.666
She didn't take it that way.

39:48.166 --> 39:52.500
-Did she think you were threatening her?
-I wasn't. That's the last thing.

39:52.583 --> 39:55.375
Well, she overreacted, right?

39:55.458 --> 39:58.875
She just was shocked that you knew.

39:59.875 --> 40:01.000
H-How did you know?

40:02.250 --> 40:04.375
I only watched Desiree that one time.

40:05.000 --> 40:06.083
You were a client?

40:06.166 --> 40:07.166
No.

40:08.791 --> 40:09.791
I…

40:10.291 --> 40:12.708
Okay, you know what?
I… I don't understand.

40:12.791 --> 40:15.958
You knew about Desiree,
but you weren't a client,

40:16.041 --> 40:17.375
so how did you know?

40:20.416 --> 40:22.000
He shows me the girls.

40:23.500 --> 40:24.458
Their tapes.

40:26.416 --> 40:27.500
I recognized her.

40:29.041 --> 40:29.916
Her voice.

40:30.833 --> 40:34.500
-The way she moves.
-Her-- I'm sorry, who is-- who is he?

40:36.791 --> 40:37.791
My cousin.

40:38.541 --> 40:40.625
He's the webcam guy at Fantasy Inc.

40:43.375 --> 40:47.625
Singapore, Bangalore,
Geneva, Glasgow, Newark.

40:48.125 --> 40:50.375
The money these people
are spending on these fantasies…

40:50.458 --> 40:52.500
We're in the wrong business, my friend.

40:53.000 --> 40:54.125
-Florida.
-Hi.

40:54.791 --> 40:57.125
-Hey, Grace. How are you doing?
-I'm good.

40:57.208 --> 40:59.208
-Can we talk?
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.

41:01.750 --> 41:03.500
-In here.
-It's all in there.

41:03.583 --> 41:07.583
The evidence of fraud
that Kathleen was collecting on Jonathan.

41:07.666 --> 41:10.458
And I found it in her things at school,

41:10.541 --> 41:13.958
which to me means that she was afraid
he'd get access to the house.

41:14.041 --> 41:17.458
Now, if Kathleen having this
isn't motive enough

41:17.958 --> 41:20.291
for him wanting her dead, I… I don't know.

41:20.916 --> 41:22.708
Did he know that she had this?

41:23.875 --> 41:25.541
His alibi is solid.

41:26.541 --> 41:28.791
So, that's it? That clears him?

41:28.875 --> 41:30.583
For now, yes. I have to go.

41:30.666 --> 41:33.375
No, no, no.
Wait, wait, wait. I'm sorry. Um…

41:34.916 --> 41:38.916
I want to apologize
for this morning. I'm sorry.

41:39.833 --> 41:41.083
You're going through a lot.

41:41.166 --> 41:45.750
It doesn't give me a free pass
to be rude to you, so I'm sorry.

41:50.208 --> 41:52.125
-Have you gone to Fantasy Inc.?
-Grace!

41:52.208 --> 41:54.958
I'm gonna take that as a yes,
and I'm also going to take it

41:55.041 --> 41:57.125
that you're not gonna tell me
what you learned.

41:57.208 --> 41:58.666
-Correct.
-Which is fine.

41:58.750 --> 42:00.875
But then I'm not gonna tell you
what I learned.

42:00.958 --> 42:03.333
Unless you want to trade?

42:03.416 --> 42:07.583
I don't do trades.
But if you have material evidence…

42:07.666 --> 42:09.458
Inelegant of me.

42:11.083 --> 42:12.916
Let's not call it a trade.

42:13.791 --> 42:15.291
Let's call it a request.

42:16.083 --> 42:19.500
I assume that you have video
of Kathleen as Desiree,

42:19.583 --> 42:20.958
and I would like to see it.

42:21.041 --> 42:24.250
I would like to see her.
Before you tell me that's a horrible idea,

42:24.333 --> 42:29.458
I just-- I want you to think about
what… what it would mean to me.

42:31.458 --> 42:35.083
And in the meantime,
of course I'm gonna tell you what I know.

42:36.416 --> 42:37.625
And it is material.

42:39.916 --> 42:43.250
Webcam guy at Fantasy Inc.
likes to watch. Let's go.

43:03.375 --> 43:04.208
Richie!

43:05.333 --> 43:06.666
It's the police.

43:11.958 --> 43:13.000
Richie Gorman.

43:13.833 --> 43:15.333
What's he done now?

43:17.916 --> 43:20.041
I don't sell the information or anything.

43:20.708 --> 43:23.416
I'd never do that. It's just for me.

43:23.500 --> 43:27.166
I mean, I work there. I have a right
to check out the performers.

43:27.250 --> 43:29.500
No. No, you don't.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.833
I only told my cousin. That's it.

43:34.708 --> 43:37.375
If Billy has anything to do with this,
it's his fault.

43:37.458 --> 43:38.458
Ma'am.

43:38.958 --> 43:39.875
Your cousin.

43:40.500 --> 43:42.500
He works maintenance at her school,

43:42.583 --> 43:44.125
but he's the only one I told.

43:45.541 --> 43:47.750
-That's it?
-That's it. I swear.

43:47.833 --> 43:49.583
No need for swearing, Richie.

43:49.666 --> 43:52.041
Either way, we're going to find out.

43:56.000 --> 43:58.625
I'll answer your question
because you turned us on to him.

43:58.708 --> 44:00.041
He knew Kathleen's identity.

44:00.125 --> 44:02.625
He says he only gave it
to his cousin, the janitor at school.

44:02.708 --> 44:04.166
We are following up on both of them.

44:04.250 --> 44:05.958
That's it. That is all that I know.

44:06.041 --> 44:07.666
Or that's all you're gonna tell me.

44:07.750 --> 44:10.208
-Don't play that game.
-This isn't a game!

44:10.291 --> 44:12.041
I'm sorry. What I meant is--

44:12.125 --> 44:15.500
What you meant is don't interfere. Right?

44:15.583 --> 44:19.458
But don't think I'm just gonna order
sandwiches for my sister's funeral,

44:19.541 --> 44:20.375
and that's it.

44:20.458 --> 44:24.791
Fine. But stay out of my investigation.
And stay out of trouble.

44:38.125 --> 44:39.541
It's a peace offering.

44:41.000 --> 44:45.541
It's teas from around the world.
There's a tea for every occasion in there.

44:45.625 --> 44:47.541
Um, a sleepy-time tea,

44:47.625 --> 44:52.375
a tea to ease the stress of modern living,

44:52.458 --> 44:54.583
a tea to awaken the senses.

44:55.875 --> 44:56.875
Thanks.

45:08.708 --> 45:09.625
I'm gonna go.

45:12.416 --> 45:13.416
Stay.

46:04.708 --> 46:07.125
<i>Good evening. Let's begin.</i>

46:18.666 --> 46:19.833
Did you feel that?

46:20.541 --> 46:23.916
Did it hurt… right where it should?

46:24.833 --> 46:26.583
Is that how you like it?

46:29.166 --> 46:31.125
You've been naughty, haven't you?

46:40.000 --> 46:42.916
So, we got, uh,
shoe prints by the back door.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.791
Sneakers, male, size 11.

46:46.583 --> 46:52.666
This is Carol Hayes, a real estate agent
and also Fantasy Inc. artist.

46:53.250 --> 46:56.291
It all fits.
We got ourselves a serial killer.

46:57.666 --> 46:59.375
How'd we hear about this one?

47:00.416 --> 47:02.625
I-- You won't believe it.

47:05.416 --> 47:08.500
I'd like to ask
that this be kept confidential.

47:09.291 --> 47:10.416
Got a family.

47:12.250 --> 47:13.958
A wife. My law firm.

47:14.041 --> 47:16.125
I'm risking my reputation

47:16.208 --> 47:18.750
because I did the right thing
and called 911.

47:18.833 --> 47:22.083
You're cooperating with us.
We'll cooperate with you, Mr. Marks.

47:22.166 --> 47:24.541
Take us through it, step by step.

47:27.458 --> 47:29.958
Well, it was going along as usual.

47:30.458 --> 47:33.666
Roxanne… I mean, she's quite special.

47:33.750 --> 47:36.500
We have a… We have a good rapport.

47:38.125 --> 47:39.083
Then all of a sudden…

47:39.166 --> 47:41.166
<i>Here's what's going to happen.</i>

47:45.000 --> 47:45.916
<i>Help me!</i>

47:50.166 --> 47:51.583
<i>Help me!</i>

47:53.708 --> 47:57.875
Like I said, I… I didn't know
if it was part of her act, or…

48:01.833 --> 48:04.666
I mean, is she okay? Roxanne?

48:04.750 --> 48:09.583
It's a good thing that you called this in,
Mr. Marks. But it wasn't an act.

48:13.500 --> 48:17.583
Look, I need
these kinds of online interactions.

48:18.291 --> 48:20.958
I need to keep
the complications to a minimum.

48:22.250 --> 48:23.708
I have low blood sugar.

48:26.625 --> 48:27.916
Mmm. Yeah.

48:28.000 --> 48:28.958
<i>So, uh…</i>

48:29.625 --> 48:32.041
And Daddy will see you
after school, okay, honey?

48:32.125 --> 48:33.500
Alright, go on in.

48:43.833 --> 48:46.750
Grace, how are you?

48:47.333 --> 48:49.625
You haven't been taking my calls.

48:49.708 --> 48:53.750
That's okay, I understand.
We're all absolutely heartbroken.

48:55.708 --> 48:57.708
-How's Kevin?
-He's doing fine.

48:57.791 --> 48:59.791
His grief counselor
and therapist recommended

48:59.875 --> 49:03.208
that he doesn't come to the funeral today.
His age, and the trauma--

49:03.291 --> 49:05.916
-Of losing his mother. Yeah.
-Here we go.

49:06.458 --> 49:07.875
It's always the husband.

49:08.875 --> 49:11.791
Didn't the police tell you
I was hosting a fundraiser that night?

49:11.875 --> 49:13.500
I must have shaken a hundred hands.

49:13.583 --> 49:14.791
You wanted her gone.

49:14.875 --> 49:17.625
Why would I?
She didn't figure in my life or Kevin's.

49:17.708 --> 49:19.083
God, she was so strong.

49:21.125 --> 49:24.541
You didn't break her.
She was going to take you on.

49:27.500 --> 49:31.250
You know those files
Kathleen was collecting on me?

49:31.333 --> 49:33.541
They're baseless.
Just one more bad decision.

49:33.625 --> 49:37.375
Oh yeah, and I know
how she was making that extra money.

49:38.250 --> 49:41.083
The list of suspects gets to be a long one
when it comes to a dead hooker.

49:50.541 --> 49:51.875
You're distraught.

49:53.000 --> 49:54.708
So I'm going to let that go.

49:59.916 --> 50:01.125
Don't come to the funeral.

50:04.666 --> 50:08.083
Well, of course I'll be there.
I'm the grieving husband.

50:14.375 --> 50:15.583
-Captain?
-Go!

50:15.666 --> 50:19.375
Yes, Captain.
So, both victims were dominatrix.

50:19.458 --> 50:21.833
Uh, not really sure of the plural.

50:21.916 --> 50:24.041
Dominatrixes, and I'm only guessing.

50:24.541 --> 50:26.333
Oh. Sounds right.

50:27.416 --> 50:30.583
Uh… …so both worked
for the adult site Fantasy Inc.

50:31.166 --> 50:33.833
A number of similarities
between the two murders.

50:33.916 --> 50:37.708
Method of entry, shoe print,
uh, a lack of physical evidence,

50:37.791 --> 50:40.041
and, uh, similar posing of the bodies.

50:40.125 --> 50:40.958
As in?

50:41.041 --> 50:44.375
Ankles crossed, arms outstretched.
A lot like crucified on a cross.

50:44.458 --> 50:47.041
Inventive, if not theologically confused.

50:48.166 --> 50:51.750
Son of God, not daughter of God.
Calculated or careless.

50:54.958 --> 50:57.500
You don't have this figured out by now?
You're my closer.

50:57.583 --> 50:58.958
Thought we had something.

50:59.041 --> 51:02.916
Kid who works at Fantasy Inc.
has access to the women's identities.

51:03.000 --> 51:05.000
He's got an airtight alibi
the night of the murders.

51:05.083 --> 51:08.666
Same as his cousin who he shared
the information with, same with the ex.

51:08.750 --> 51:11.500
Come back with something.

51:11.583 --> 51:12.666
Yes, ma'am.

51:13.666 --> 51:15.375
-Captain, ma'am.

51:16.916 --> 51:19.166
Word is you and the victim's sister.

51:19.250 --> 51:22.166
Yeah. Don't give me that look.
You know what I'm going to say.

51:22.250 --> 51:23.625
We can leave it at that.

51:23.708 --> 51:24.541
Can we?

51:26.208 --> 51:27.750
I know where to draw the line.

51:33.666 --> 51:35.416
<i>Kathleen was my little sister.</i>

51:38.125 --> 51:42.125
She wanted me to know
how much her life had changed.

51:43.041 --> 51:44.250
She discovered that…

51:49.458 --> 51:51.625
that she loved to teach.

51:51.708 --> 51:54.375
And she loved her students.

51:54.458 --> 51:55.625
But most of all…

51:58.375 --> 51:59.708
she loved Kevin.

52:01.916 --> 52:03.333
Her son.

52:04.000 --> 52:06.083
Her reason to live.

52:08.916 --> 52:10.708
So losing her like this,

52:12.083 --> 52:14.750
well, it's really hard.

52:17.666 --> 52:21.958
There was so much promise
and hope and motivation.

52:25.041 --> 52:26.875
My baby sister.

52:27.375 --> 52:32.083
I was privileged to have known her,
and to have loved her,

52:32.916 --> 52:36.541
and to have been loved by her.

52:40.166 --> 52:41.166
Thank you.

52:46.833 --> 52:47.833
Let us pray.

52:50.666 --> 52:52.208
Thank you for being here.

52:52.291 --> 52:53.708
Thank you for having us.

52:57.041 --> 52:59.375
Thank you, Father. Thank you.

53:01.583 --> 53:02.416
Hi.

53:06.708 --> 53:09.416
-Thank you both for coming.
-Real sorry, Grace.

53:09.500 --> 53:11.750
The forensics team's done with the house.

53:11.833 --> 53:14.500
You're free to move back in,
unless that's…

53:14.583 --> 53:17.750
Oh yeah, no.
I'm definitely going to be moving in.

53:20.041 --> 53:22.916
Jonathan Breezewood was
spying on Kathleen.

53:23.000 --> 53:24.375
He knew about Desiree.

53:24.458 --> 53:27.041
He knew about the file
that she was keeping on him,

53:27.125 --> 53:29.250
and he admitted that to me.

53:29.333 --> 53:31.375
So what does that tell you about motive?

53:32.250 --> 53:34.166
The eulogy was beautiful, Grace.

53:40.500 --> 53:41.583
We'll be in touch.

53:54.833 --> 53:58.041
Excuse me. Can I have a second?
Thank you so much.

54:00.083 --> 54:01.750
The funeral is Invitation only.

54:01.833 --> 54:04.875
Kathleen wouldn't want you here.
I don't want you here.

54:04.958 --> 54:06.041
Careful, Grace.

54:06.125 --> 54:08.250
I won't have you tarnish my good name.

54:08.333 --> 54:12.250
Now, reign in your overactive imagination,
or I will do it for you.

54:14.416 --> 54:15.416
Senator!

54:30.500 --> 54:32.083
I'm sorry, I shouldn't be here.

54:32.166 --> 54:34.208
No, no. It's okay, Jerald.

54:36.583 --> 54:38.083
I'm so glad you could be here.

54:41.208 --> 54:43.750
Mrs. Breezewood said one time
that lilies mean innocence.

54:43.833 --> 54:44.875
Mmm.

54:45.375 --> 54:47.791
You see them at funerals
because they symbolize

54:47.875 --> 54:51.458
that death restores innocence
to the departed.

54:52.333 --> 54:54.750
At least,
that's what our grandmother told us.

54:55.791 --> 54:58.041
I sent them. The lilies.

55:00.000 --> 55:01.333
Jerald.

55:02.666 --> 55:07.791
Apologies, Ms. Miller.
My son has problems with boundaries.

55:07.875 --> 55:10.625
Oh no. Jerald has been
nothing but thoughtful.

55:11.458 --> 55:14.375
My sincere condolences. Martha Baxter.

55:14.458 --> 55:16.666
Thank you, Senator.
Thank you so much for coming.

55:17.541 --> 55:18.541
Jerald.

56:03.708 --> 56:04.708
-Hey.
-Grace.

56:05.333 --> 56:06.708
I've got something.

56:06.791 --> 56:11.083
Hi, Captain Rivera. I am Grace Miller,
Kathleen Breezewood's sister.

56:11.166 --> 56:15.375
I know who you are, and I want to say
how very sorry I am for your loss.

56:15.458 --> 56:16.666
-We all are.
-Thank you.

56:16.750 --> 56:18.958
I just need
five minutes of your time, please.

56:19.958 --> 56:21.916
Detective Jennings, will you join us?

56:22.750 --> 56:23.750
Hmm.

56:25.791 --> 56:29.250
It's an in memoriam card.
It was sent to the church.

56:29.333 --> 56:32.583
It says, "Desiree,
now you are where you belong."

56:33.458 --> 56:36.500
We'll have the card checked for prints.
Thank you for bringing that in.

56:36.583 --> 56:41.458
Sure. Uh, Captain,
I really think that I can contribute a lot

56:41.541 --> 56:43.250
to this investigation.

56:43.333 --> 56:45.958
Detective, have you made
any promises to Ms. Miller?

56:46.041 --> 56:48.583
God no, he's been
keeping me away from everything,

56:48.666 --> 56:50.291
but there's a second victim now.

56:50.375 --> 56:53.708
Captain, I have an instinct for motive.

56:53.791 --> 56:57.166
I mean, it's why
my books are so successful.

56:57.250 --> 57:01.500
I can get inside the mind of a killer,
especially the ones that prey on women.

57:02.291 --> 57:06.791
Do you know how long it took the NYPD
to find the Times Square rapist?

57:07.583 --> 57:08.958
Eight months.

57:09.625 --> 57:14.708
And I came in, I studied the case,
and they caught the guy three days later.

57:15.291 --> 57:18.791
So all I'm saying is
you can use me as an asset.

57:18.875 --> 57:23.083
Fresh thinking sometimes makes
all the difference, you know?

57:24.333 --> 57:28.416
Let me in on this.
I promise you you will not regret it.

57:28.500 --> 57:32.625
Grace, I read your books cover to cover
the minute I can get my hands on them.

57:32.708 --> 57:35.750
You really are one of
the most astute profilers out there.

57:36.250 --> 57:38.750
I just can't see you
contributing to this case.

57:39.250 --> 57:42.416
Okay, well, let's just take the bodies,
for instance.

57:43.875 --> 57:47.875
They look like they're in the same pose,
but there is a difference between them.

57:47.958 --> 57:53.583
Like, Kathleen's body,
it looks… haphazard,

57:53.666 --> 57:57.125
like they just left her
in her very last moment.

57:58.208 --> 58:03.708
Whereas the second victim,
it's like he took more care with her,

58:03.791 --> 58:08.041
to pose her maybe
in a position that mimicked Kathleen's.

58:08.125 --> 58:10.000
Which we already discussed.

58:10.833 --> 58:14.666
How he poses the bodies,
suggesting a motive meant to mislead us.

58:15.708 --> 58:19.500
Okay. Why dominatrixes,
two of them? What's that about?

58:19.583 --> 58:21.416
Well, something that Ed-- Uh--

58:21.916 --> 58:24.458
Sorry, Detective Jennings said,

58:24.541 --> 58:26.791
uh, was that maybe it was about control.

58:26.875 --> 58:30.666
And I really think that that is the key
to finding the motive.

58:32.166 --> 58:33.250
Or maybe it's random.

58:33.875 --> 58:35.375
Listen, it can't be both.

58:35.458 --> 58:36.666
-Detective Jennings…
-Captain.

58:36.750 --> 58:38.916
…I'm approving Grace Miller
as a consultant.

58:39.000 --> 58:41.000
Give her all the access she needs.

58:44.625 --> 58:47.125
I like your captain. She's decisive.

58:47.208 --> 58:49.291
"Fresh thinking can make
all the difference," huh?

58:49.375 --> 58:53.750
Ed, I respect what you do, your expertise.
How about you do the same for me?

58:53.833 --> 58:57.666
We're results-driven here, Grace.
In the real world, that's how it works.

58:57.750 --> 58:58.750
Okay, you know what?

58:58.833 --> 59:02.583
You want me to believe
that Jonathan Breezewood is not a suspect.

59:02.666 --> 59:04.041
I'll keep an open mind.

59:04.541 --> 59:07.458
Sorry. Um, we just got tape
on the Carol Hayes murder.

59:10.416 --> 59:12.583
"Give her all the access she needs."

59:23.625 --> 59:25.750
<i>So, here's what's going to happen.</i>

59:36.208 --> 59:37.208
<i>Help me!</i>

59:38.166 --> 59:39.833
<i>Help me!</i>

59:51.166 --> 59:52.541
<i>Desiree.</i>

59:52.625 --> 59:55.291
What was that? What did he say? Go back.

59:58.250 --> 59:59.458
<i>Desiree.</i>

1:00:03.583 --> 1:00:04.875
So, not random.

1:00:21.916 --> 1:00:23.125
-You okay?
-Mm-hmm.

1:00:24.791 --> 1:00:28.208
Hey. We traced the card.
It came with flowers sent to the church.

1:00:28.291 --> 1:00:29.333
What kind of flowers?

1:00:29.416 --> 1:00:32.083
Roses. We got the name on the credit card.

1:00:32.166 --> 1:00:34.333
-Okay.
-Let's go. All of us.

1:00:37.958 --> 1:00:41.708
Desiree? That's not a name a man forgets.

1:00:41.791 --> 1:00:44.666
And this Kathleen Breezewood? No idea.

1:00:45.291 --> 1:00:49.791
You sent flowers to her funeral.
Charged to your credit card.

1:00:49.875 --> 1:00:51.541
Yeah. Flowers by Emily.

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:54.458
Funeral arrangement,
with this handwritten note.

1:00:57.041 --> 1:00:58.541
It's not my handwriting.

1:00:58.625 --> 1:01:02.375
Is it your son's?
Your son is Rand Morgan, right?

1:01:03.625 --> 1:01:06.000
Kathleen Breezewood was his teacher.

1:01:06.583 --> 1:01:09.291
Where was Rand
on the evening of the 10th?

1:01:10.000 --> 1:01:13.125
The 10th.
At the Kennedy Center with my wife.

1:01:13.208 --> 1:01:16.958
-And he was there the whole night?
-Rand wasn't feeling well.

1:01:17.041 --> 1:01:18.958
I had my driver
take him home at the intermission.

1:01:19.041 --> 1:01:20.791
What size shoe is your son?

1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:23.875
Size 11, or so.

1:01:23.958 --> 1:01:26.166
Mr. Morgan,
we'd like to speak with your son.

1:01:27.375 --> 1:01:28.583
Now would be great.

1:01:37.291 --> 1:01:40.416
That night at the Kennedy Center,
you weren't feeling well, remember?

1:01:40.500 --> 1:01:42.208
The driver brought you home
at intermission

1:01:42.291 --> 1:01:44.291
and you were here till we came back.

1:01:44.791 --> 1:01:45.625
Yeah.

1:01:45.708 --> 1:01:48.375
You can prove you were here?
You never left the house.

1:01:48.458 --> 1:01:50.625
I was here. The housekeeper saw me.

1:01:50.708 --> 1:01:52.458
We're gonna have to talk to her.

1:01:52.541 --> 1:01:54.750
And did you use your father's credit card

1:01:54.833 --> 1:01:57.291
to order flowers
to Kathleen Breezewood's funeral?

1:01:57.375 --> 1:01:59.458
No, I have my own credit card.

1:01:59.541 --> 1:02:01.875
And no, I didn't send flowers.

1:02:02.583 --> 1:02:04.333
No, I mean, why? The class did.

1:02:07.166 --> 1:02:08.166
Hi.

1:02:10.041 --> 1:02:13.500
How did you feel about my sister?

1:02:14.750 --> 1:02:15.958
How do you mean?

1:02:16.041 --> 1:02:18.583
Well, you told me
that she was hard on you.

1:02:21.541 --> 1:02:23.083
-Yeah.
-Were you attracted to her?

1:02:23.666 --> 1:02:25.541
No. No, no, no. She was old.

1:02:27.500 --> 1:02:28.500
Older.

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:32.666
I mean, no,
she was… she was hot. But--

1:02:32.750 --> 1:02:34.250
-Rand.
-No, she asked.

1:02:37.208 --> 1:02:40.958
I didn't think about her
outside of class. Even in class.

1:02:42.250 --> 1:02:43.250
Okay?

1:02:44.125 --> 1:02:46.000
Our housekeeper's information.

1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:52.333
Thank you for your time.
We'll get back to you.

1:02:59.625 --> 1:03:00.625
Good work.

1:03:06.666 --> 1:03:09.250
Look at these kids. They've got it made.

1:03:09.333 --> 1:03:11.666
There's killers in every tax bracket.

1:03:11.750 --> 1:03:15.750
-What do you think, Grace? The kid?
-He's definitely hiding something.

1:03:15.833 --> 1:03:18.791
Writer's instinct? Had to be him
that used the credit card

1:03:18.875 --> 1:03:21.458
to send the flowers and the card.
That's what he's hiding.

1:03:22.250 --> 1:03:25.375
He's too smart to be that blatant.
There's something else.

1:03:41.291 --> 1:03:42.583
That's all for now.

1:03:47.333 --> 1:03:48.208
Good night.

1:04:34.541 --> 1:04:35.625
Desiree.

1:05:02.291 --> 1:05:03.750
We've got three clients

1:05:03.833 --> 1:05:06.666
who had regular meetings
with Desiree and Roxanne.

1:05:06.750 --> 1:05:09.416
-Locals?
-London, Paris, Berlin.

1:05:09.500 --> 1:05:10.708
Contact Interpol.

1:05:10.791 --> 1:05:14.291
I'll check in with immigration,
find out if any of them are in D.C. now.

1:05:14.375 --> 1:05:17.250
There's been another attack.
This one survived.

1:05:19.666 --> 1:05:22.791
There's blood on the blade.
Lab will get us results real quick.

1:05:24.375 --> 1:05:25.666
What's the victim's name?

1:05:27.416 --> 1:05:29.083
-Bethany Knowles.
-Thank you.

1:05:31.625 --> 1:05:34.833
Hey, Bethany. I'm Detective Jennings.

1:05:34.916 --> 1:05:38.541
This is my partner, Detective Parker,
and this is Ms. Miller.

1:05:41.791 --> 1:05:43.041
How are you doing?

1:05:47.291 --> 1:05:50.375
My husband was out with the kids.

1:05:51.791 --> 1:05:54.000
We keep them away when I'm working.

1:05:56.625 --> 1:05:58.833
Thank God they got back at the right time.

1:06:02.208 --> 1:06:05.375
Can you tell us about him,
the guy that attacked you?

1:06:08.416 --> 1:06:09.625
-Uh…

1:06:13.208 --> 1:06:14.875
Bethany, we want you to know

1:06:15.625 --> 1:06:19.291
how incredibly relieved we are
that you're okay,

1:06:19.375 --> 1:06:21.666
and really how brave you are.

1:06:22.166 --> 1:06:23.291
You fought him off,

1:06:23.375 --> 1:06:24.958
and there's blood on the knife,

1:06:25.041 --> 1:06:26.000
which is evidence,

1:06:26.083 --> 1:06:28.583
and that's gonna help us
put this guy away.

1:06:31.375 --> 1:06:34.500
He was… white.

1:06:35.625 --> 1:06:36.875
Six feet or so.

1:06:38.208 --> 1:06:40.333
His strength surprised me.

1:06:41.708 --> 1:06:43.458
Did he call you by a name?

1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:47.166
Desiree.

1:06:49.791 --> 1:06:52.875
And why did his strength surprise you?

1:06:52.958 --> 1:06:55.875
Because he seemed so young.

1:06:56.541 --> 1:06:57.708
How young?

1:06:57.791 --> 1:07:00.125
Like a teenager.

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:07.125
He was wearing a really fancy watch.

1:07:07.625 --> 1:07:09.708
Sorry, what do you mean, fancy?

1:07:09.791 --> 1:07:11.125
Gold, silver?

1:07:11.208 --> 1:07:12.208
Gold.

1:07:13.250 --> 1:07:16.916
With those little faces inside
that tell time all over the world.

1:07:18.000 --> 1:07:20.125
You know. Expensive.

1:07:26.666 --> 1:07:27.666
A search warrant?

1:07:37.208 --> 1:07:39.416
Hey. Size 11s.

1:07:54.333 --> 1:07:56.458
This search warrant is just fishing!

1:07:56.541 --> 1:07:59.416
Are you going to round up
every kid with a size 11 shoe?

1:08:00.541 --> 1:08:01.541
How long you had this?

1:08:01.625 --> 1:08:04.458
Rand's wrestling team
won State two years ago.

1:08:04.541 --> 1:08:07.416
The coaches got them all one,
even the student managers.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.833
He never wears it.

1:08:09.500 --> 1:08:11.791
-You been out tonight?
-He hasn't left the place.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:14.583
Is that true? Is that
what the cameras are going to show?

1:08:15.791 --> 1:08:17.291
I went for a walk in the park.

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:19.500
Take off your shirt.

1:08:19.583 --> 1:08:21.166
-Uh--
-It's in the warrant.

1:08:22.791 --> 1:08:23.791
Do it.

1:08:28.666 --> 1:08:31.166
-Care to explain that?
-Don't answer.

1:08:36.416 --> 1:08:37.416
In here.

1:08:45.791 --> 1:08:48.291
-Where's Grace?
-Wherever she wants to be.

1:08:51.625 --> 1:08:52.625
What do you want?

1:08:53.333 --> 1:08:56.041
Whatever it is
that you haven't told me so far.

1:08:56.625 --> 1:08:59.666
I told you.
My cousin Richie works for Fantasy Inc.

1:08:59.750 --> 1:09:03.000
He's the one who told me
about your sister. That's it.

1:09:03.083 --> 1:09:04.458
Who else did he tell?

1:09:04.541 --> 1:09:06.750
I don't want anyone else
getting in trouble.

1:09:07.250 --> 1:09:11.583
Trust me, okay? Rand Morgan is
in plenty of trouble already.

1:09:13.375 --> 1:09:14.291
He told him.

1:09:14.875 --> 1:09:16.708
Richie. About Desiree.

1:09:19.583 --> 1:09:20.583
Him and Richie.

1:09:22.625 --> 1:09:23.500
They're…

1:09:25.333 --> 1:09:26.166
together.

1:09:26.875 --> 1:09:28.541
<i>They don't want anyone else to know.</i>

1:09:28.625 --> 1:09:31.458
He's tech-savvy.
I mean, that set-up in his room?

1:09:32.041 --> 1:09:36.041
Sneakers size and print matched
the prints at all three crime scenes.

1:09:36.125 --> 1:09:38.500
The mud on his runners is not a match.

1:09:38.583 --> 1:09:39.583
The gold watch.

1:09:39.666 --> 1:09:43.416
You can buy it
in some recognition gifts catalog.

1:09:43.500 --> 1:09:47.041
It's real gold and expensive,
but nowhere near as rare as it looks.

1:09:47.125 --> 1:09:49.916
He was gone from the house tonight
for 90 minutes.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:53.000
The composite sketch
from Bethany's description could be him.

1:09:53.083 --> 1:09:55.791
Lab says it's not his blood
on Bethany Knowles' knife.

1:09:55.875 --> 1:09:58.375
So, you buy his story
about cutting his arm

1:09:58.458 --> 1:10:00.291
when he jumped a fence in the park?

1:10:01.916 --> 1:10:05.416
Look, we've got his computer.
He spent time on Fantasy Inc.

1:10:05.500 --> 1:10:07.541
He looked at Desiree five times.

1:10:07.625 --> 1:10:10.666
-Also Roxanne and Bethany.
-It could be a curiosity.

1:10:10.750 --> 1:10:14.000
Ed, look, I know you're playing
devil's advocate, but come on.

1:10:14.083 --> 1:10:16.250
The evidence against the kid
is stacking up.

1:10:16.333 --> 1:10:18.083
Okay, Rand is not the killer.

1:10:18.666 --> 1:10:21.041
Rand is Richie's boyfriend.

1:10:21.125 --> 1:10:23.500
Richie is the kid from Fantasy Inc.

1:10:23.583 --> 1:10:25.666
And Rand is not out to his dad yet.

1:10:25.750 --> 1:10:30.291
Which, to me… I am willing to bet money
that Rand and Richie were together

1:10:30.375 --> 1:10:31.916
at the time of the other murders.

1:10:32.000 --> 1:10:35.041
And, obviously,
I agree with Ed on curiosity.

1:10:35.541 --> 1:10:37.041
That's good work, Grace.

1:10:41.375 --> 1:10:42.375
Can I have five?

1:10:51.458 --> 1:10:52.708
Writer's instincts.

1:10:53.833 --> 1:10:54.750
Paid off.

1:10:55.416 --> 1:10:57.083
Uh, tell me about Desiree.

1:10:59.375 --> 1:11:00.958
It was her creation.

1:11:01.041 --> 1:11:04.041
It takes talent
and imagination for performance.

1:11:04.125 --> 1:11:05.541
Your sister had both.

1:11:07.208 --> 1:11:10.208
A lot of clients are
missing Desiree right now.

1:11:10.291 --> 1:11:13.000
In fact, it's having
a big impact on our business.

1:11:13.083 --> 1:11:16.791
I have, uh,
been interviewing a few new ones,

1:11:16.875 --> 1:11:19.208
but they'll never be another Desiree.

1:11:20.000 --> 1:11:21.000
What if there is?

1:11:58.000 --> 1:11:59.750
<i>This is your Desiree.</i>

1:12:00.958 --> 1:12:04.375
I'm in the mood… to play.

1:12:08.875 --> 1:12:10.958
<i>This is what you want.</i>

1:12:14.125 --> 1:12:16.958
-Say it! Say it!

1:12:21.166 --> 1:12:23.250
Grace, hey. Come in.

1:12:25.125 --> 1:12:28.875
Kitchen cabinets arrived.
Flat front panel.

1:12:28.958 --> 1:12:31.375
Going for modern.

1:12:32.666 --> 1:12:34.625
Look, uh, so,

1:12:36.041 --> 1:12:38.041
I was gonna go over and see you.

1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:43.083
I respect you, Grace.
What you bring to this. I'm only…

1:12:45.083 --> 1:12:47.041
wanting you to stay safe.

1:12:52.250 --> 1:12:56.250
If anything ever happened to you,
I would lose my mind.

1:13:28.875 --> 1:13:29.875
Grace.

1:13:33.500 --> 1:13:35.375
Once isn't going to be enough.

1:14:17.541 --> 1:14:18.541
Good morning.

1:14:19.041 --> 1:14:20.041
Mmm.

1:14:21.625 --> 1:14:23.416
It's a very good morning.

1:14:24.625 --> 1:14:25.625
Any regrets?

1:14:26.541 --> 1:14:27.541
None.

1:14:29.166 --> 1:14:31.875
It's only going to get
more complicated from here.

1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:38.416
-Oh.
-Here.

1:14:42.958 --> 1:14:44.916
Hmm. Meeting in an hour.

1:14:45.000 --> 1:14:46.291
Mm-hmm.

1:14:46.916 --> 1:14:49.375
Free donuts are a thing, though.
And they are delicious.

1:14:49.458 --> 1:14:50.416
Mm-mm.

1:14:56.916 --> 1:14:57.833
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

1:14:57.916 --> 1:15:00.833
I was planning an intervention
with the two of you this morning,

1:15:00.916 --> 1:15:03.958
but apparently there's
a change in the weather.

1:15:08.916 --> 1:15:12.625
-Morning, everybody.
-Okay, let's get this party started.

1:15:15.125 --> 1:15:19.125
Uh, we confirmed
that Rand was with his Fantasy Inc. friend

1:15:19.208 --> 1:15:20.625
both nights in question.

1:15:20.708 --> 1:15:24.041
And we began questioning students
at Kathleen Breezewood's school,

1:15:24.125 --> 1:15:26.458
starting with her English
and drama students.

1:15:26.541 --> 1:15:29.708
This may be the way to go,
but that is only one possibility.

1:15:29.791 --> 1:15:32.333
I actually thought of another possibility.

1:15:32.416 --> 1:15:36.500
What if we bait the killer
out into the open…

1:15:38.666 --> 1:15:41.000
by using me as the bait?

1:15:41.500 --> 1:15:44.291
I'd become Fantasy Inc.'s new Desiree.

1:15:44.375 --> 1:15:47.583
Same name, same playroom, similar outfit.

1:15:48.750 --> 1:15:50.875
And I trigger the killer to come after me.

1:15:50.958 --> 1:15:53.583
-Come on.
-Fantasy Inc. agreed to this?

1:15:53.666 --> 1:15:56.541
Honestly, they're willing to do
whatever it takes to solve this,

1:15:56.625 --> 1:15:59.375
and… so am I.

1:15:59.458 --> 1:16:00.583
It's worth a shot.

1:16:01.625 --> 1:16:03.125
Hold on. You can't be good with this.

1:16:03.208 --> 1:16:07.458
She's about motivation, and instinct,
and solving murders on paper,

1:16:07.541 --> 1:16:08.666
not in the line of fire.

1:16:08.750 --> 1:16:11.833
Okay, well, I have
a lot of thoughts on motive,

1:16:11.916 --> 1:16:15.250
but this gets us there a lot faster
before someone else has to die.

1:16:15.333 --> 1:16:18.041
-That someone could be you.
-Grace, you got guts.

1:16:18.125 --> 1:16:19.500
And a twisty mind.

1:16:20.125 --> 1:16:21.125
Let's do it.

1:16:21.208 --> 1:16:23.416
-Come-- Captain!
-Save it.

1:16:25.541 --> 1:16:27.666
Weather changes awful fast around here.

1:16:33.666 --> 1:16:35.541
I'm sorry. I didn't tell you

1:16:35.625 --> 1:16:38.125
because I thought
you would try to talk me out of it.

1:16:38.208 --> 1:16:39.791
Well, you got that right.

1:16:44.708 --> 1:16:48.458
<i>Good evening. Desiree is back.</i>

1:16:50.333 --> 1:16:54.000
I can't hear you. Louder.

1:17:03.541 --> 1:17:04.541
Say it!

1:17:06.875 --> 1:17:07.875
Say it!

1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:15.250
So let's begin.

1:17:17.750 --> 1:17:20.833
This is what you want.
This is what you need.

1:17:24.666 --> 1:17:27.208
Can you jump back to camera A for me?

1:17:31.583 --> 1:17:33.125
So, how long do you think

1:17:33.208 --> 1:17:36.000
before he realizes
that there's another Desiree?

1:17:38.208 --> 1:17:40.666
He might be
smart enough to wait a while.

1:18:03.208 --> 1:18:05.625
Just got word,
Jonathan Breezewood's acting attorney

1:18:05.708 --> 1:18:07.500
for a real estate conglomerate

1:18:07.583 --> 1:18:10.708
with some ties
to pretty sketchy investors.

1:18:11.375 --> 1:18:14.208
If he wanted to put a hit out,
he knew who to call.

1:18:14.291 --> 1:18:16.291
I don't know. I know Jonathan Breezewood.

1:18:16.375 --> 1:18:20.708
I can see him wanting Kathleen dead,
but the other two, it's just…

1:18:21.291 --> 1:18:23.625
Copycat murders.
Wouldn't be the first time.

1:18:24.875 --> 1:18:26.958
-Two killers?
-Fresh thinking.

1:18:27.541 --> 1:18:30.416
Follow up on Breezewood,
and go to that school.

1:18:30.500 --> 1:18:33.833
Your copycat killer, if he exists,
could be in those classrooms.

1:18:36.500 --> 1:18:40.166
I don't think
I even spoke to Mrs. Breezewood. Ever.

1:18:40.916 --> 1:18:43.125
I was always hoping she'd notice me.

1:18:43.208 --> 1:18:46.125
I wasn't really into,
you know, drama or English.

1:18:47.666 --> 1:18:49.791
Anything struck you as unusual?

1:18:50.291 --> 1:18:51.125
Mm-mmm.

1:18:52.125 --> 1:18:54.458
How about her relationship
with her students?

1:18:54.541 --> 1:18:55.458
It's good.

1:18:58.208 --> 1:19:01.541
Your teacher was murdered.
Time to speak up if you know anything.

1:19:01.625 --> 1:19:04.125
I really liked her. Everyone did.

1:19:05.708 --> 1:19:07.875
I… I just can't imagine
anyone from this school

1:19:07.958 --> 1:19:09.500
doing that to Mrs. Breezewood.

1:19:11.791 --> 1:19:14.291
I bet any of those kids
could have hacked into the site

1:19:14.375 --> 1:19:15.791
without leaving tracks.

1:19:15.875 --> 1:19:17.958
All they have to do
to hide their IP address is

1:19:18.041 --> 1:19:20.708
hack into some unprotected system
outside the country.

1:19:38.250 --> 1:19:40.041
You're really off your game, Randy.

1:19:41.875 --> 1:19:42.875
Don't call me that.

1:19:43.458 --> 1:19:46.750
I got you down.
Held you down and kept you there, Randy.

1:19:52.958 --> 1:19:54.083
Kathleen?

1:19:57.625 --> 1:19:59.916
-Or should I say Desiree?

1:20:02.583 --> 1:20:05.000
-You get off watching her?
-Think this is a joke?

1:20:05.083 --> 1:20:07.375
No, the only joke is
the cops think I killed her.

1:20:09.875 --> 1:20:13.250
And bro, you were the one
who was obsessed with her.

1:20:14.166 --> 1:20:16.666
-I saw the way you looked at her.

1:20:17.708 --> 1:20:21.166
She's my Kathleen! My Kathleen!

1:20:35.083 --> 1:20:36.750
-You're not gonna get it.

1:20:36.833 --> 1:20:38.583
-No, that's cool.
-You know I hate-- Jennings.

1:20:41.291 --> 1:20:42.291
Thanks.

1:20:43.541 --> 1:20:44.750
What is going on?

1:20:44.833 --> 1:20:49.166
Rand Morgan's in the ER. His father said
Jerald's the one who put him there.

1:20:51.791 --> 1:20:53.416
Hey. Stay sharp.

1:21:06.708 --> 1:21:08.583
-What happened?
-Jerald Baxter tried to kill him!

1:21:09.291 --> 1:21:10.291
Rand.

1:21:10.375 --> 1:21:11.375
He lost it

1:21:12.375 --> 1:21:16.541
when I said that I…
I knew she was Desiree.

1:21:17.333 --> 1:21:21.750
He, uh… he called her his Kathleen.

1:21:28.541 --> 1:21:30.666
Speech for the Missouri Beef Alliance.

1:21:30.750 --> 1:21:34.458
It's a good thing they don't know
I've turned vegetarian.

1:21:41.083 --> 1:21:42.458
You know the rules.

1:21:48.958 --> 1:21:51.833
Jerald, when I speak to you,
I expect you to respond.

1:21:51.916 --> 1:21:52.916
I know the rules.

1:21:54.208 --> 1:21:56.166
Only you can use your device at dinner.

1:21:58.541 --> 1:22:00.333
I'm taking you to a therapist.

1:22:00.416 --> 1:22:02.166
Since that teacher's funeral,
you've been--

1:22:02.250 --> 1:22:04.125
We have grief counselors coming tomorrow.

1:22:04.791 --> 1:22:06.875
Be in front of the school at 10:30.

1:22:06.958 --> 1:22:09.291
Mom, I hardly knew her.

1:22:09.791 --> 1:22:12.250
I feel bad, but I'll get over it.

1:22:13.791 --> 1:22:16.291
There. Just saved you 10k.

1:22:19.000 --> 1:22:22.291
If my only concern in parenting you
were tied to a dollar figure,

1:22:22.375 --> 1:22:24.000
I never would have had you.

1:22:30.708 --> 1:22:33.958
Grace. We just issued
an arrest warrant for Jerald Baxter.

1:22:34.041 --> 1:22:35.083
We got our killer.

1:22:35.166 --> 1:22:38.791
-You have enough evidence to charge him?
-Enough to question him.

1:22:38.875 --> 1:22:42.250
And all the evidence we thought we had
on Rand Morgan actually points to Baxter.

1:22:42.333 --> 1:22:43.875
Even the composite sketch.

1:22:43.958 --> 1:22:45.833
Okay. You know his mom's a senator,

1:22:45.916 --> 1:22:48.166
so we got to make sure
that evidence is solid.

1:22:48.250 --> 1:22:52.125
We'll get it. Thank you, Grace,
for all of your insights,

1:22:52.208 --> 1:22:55.916
and obviously for being willing
to put yourself out there.

1:22:56.000 --> 1:22:59.458
But at the end of the day,
it's solid police work that gets us there.

1:22:59.541 --> 1:23:03.625
So, we can all stand down
and you can get out of that costume.

1:23:06.291 --> 1:23:08.708
Okay, boys. Let's pack it up and go home.

1:24:06.875 --> 1:24:09.375
-I've an arrest warrant for Jerald Baxter.
-What?

1:24:09.458 --> 1:24:11.750
For the murders
of Kathleen Breezewood and Carol Hayes…

1:24:11.833 --> 1:24:12.791
This is ridiculous.

1:24:12.875 --> 1:24:14.375
…and the attempted murder
of Bethany Knowles.

1:24:14.458 --> 1:24:15.750
-Who's your captain?
-Where is he?

1:24:15.833 --> 1:24:18.208
He's in the basement,
but he's very studious.

1:24:18.291 --> 1:24:19.916
He doesn't like to be disturbed.

1:24:20.000 --> 1:24:22.291
Jerald! Jerald!

1:24:23.666 --> 1:24:24.666
Jerald!

1:24:28.416 --> 1:24:30.166
D.C. Homicide, open the door!

1:24:44.375 --> 1:24:45.875
All right, we're clear.

1:24:50.000 --> 1:24:52.791
Calling an APB. Jerald Baxter.

1:25:56.791 --> 1:25:59.166
Hmm. You don't look surprised.

1:26:00.083 --> 1:26:01.000
Mmm.

1:26:01.083 --> 1:26:05.166
You're a smart boy, Jerald.
I knew you wouldn't get caught.

1:26:06.750 --> 1:26:09.916
I also knew
that you would rush right over here.

1:26:10.791 --> 1:26:11.708
To Desiree.

1:26:11.791 --> 1:26:15.333
You think you know everything.
I loved Kathleen.

1:26:15.416 --> 1:26:18.000
Yeah, you loved Kathleen

1:26:18.083 --> 1:26:22.125
because she embodied everything
that your mother isn't.

1:26:22.708 --> 1:26:25.250
She was nurturing and caring.

1:26:25.333 --> 1:26:30.375
But once she became Desiree,
well, you had to kill her, right?

1:26:30.458 --> 1:26:32.375
Because she was trying to control you,

1:26:32.458 --> 1:26:36.125
and that was
a little too close to home for you.

1:26:36.208 --> 1:26:37.208
Wow.

1:26:38.916 --> 1:26:40.708
And your readers lap that up?

1:26:41.583 --> 1:26:43.250
Here's the part you haven't written.

1:26:44.916 --> 1:26:50.000
The part when Jerald
squeezes the life out of the sister,

1:26:51.250 --> 1:26:53.166
walks away undetected,

1:26:53.250 --> 1:26:57.791
goes home and calls 911
to say, his voice shaking,

1:26:57.875 --> 1:27:00.375
that he's found his dear mother's body

1:27:00.458 --> 1:27:03.458
at the foot of the stairs,
her neck broken.

1:27:04.708 --> 1:27:06.750
Then the sad truth uncovered.

1:27:06.833 --> 1:27:08.833
Her secret drinking habit.

1:27:08.916 --> 1:27:13.000
As the son weeps uncontrollably,

1:27:13.791 --> 1:27:18.708
grieving for his famous mother,
the mother of Missouri.

1:27:21.250 --> 1:27:24.750
Oh, you got to admit, I got writing talent
too, don't you think, Grace?

1:27:24.833 --> 1:27:26.541
You killed my sister.

1:27:26.625 --> 1:27:28.250
I killed Desiree!

1:27:29.083 --> 1:27:30.250
I had to!

1:27:31.875 --> 1:27:33.208
But that hurt me.

1:27:35.166 --> 1:27:39.625
Knowing that I would never see
Kathleen's smile encourage me.

1:27:40.875 --> 1:27:43.875
You killed Kathleen,
you killed Carol Hayes,

1:27:43.958 --> 1:27:46.208
and you tried to kill Bethany Knowles.

1:27:46.291 --> 1:27:48.875
Yes, they're all Desiree! All of them!

1:27:56.375 --> 1:27:57.833
That's it. It's over.

1:27:57.916 --> 1:28:01.125
It's a confession,
it's live, and it's out there.

1:28:01.708 --> 1:28:04.625
No one needs to die here tonight.
Not me, not you.

1:28:04.708 --> 1:28:06.750
You're gonna die tonight!

1:28:07.625 --> 1:28:09.000
Unless you beg me!

1:28:09.625 --> 1:28:11.291
Go on. Beg!

1:28:11.375 --> 1:28:13.166
-She loved me!

1:28:49.333 --> 1:28:51.208
Beg me! Beg me!

1:28:51.791 --> 1:28:52.916
Freeze!

1:29:02.250 --> 1:29:04.625
Are you okay? Hey, Grace.

1:29:05.125 --> 1:29:07.625
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1:29:12.166 --> 1:29:13.166
I'm okay.

1:29:24.958 --> 1:29:27.416
Looks like I turned someone
into a tea drinker.

1:29:27.500 --> 1:29:29.375
-Mmm.
-What kind did you get?

1:29:30.000 --> 1:29:32.000
-Awakens the senses.
-Mmm.

1:29:32.708 --> 1:29:35.958
Although I feel like
my senses are already pretty awake.

1:29:36.041 --> 1:29:39.916
Hmm. That is called
case closed adrenaline,

1:29:40.000 --> 1:29:41.958
and there's nothing like it.

1:29:42.041 --> 1:29:47.666
No, I was thinking it's another kind of
non-police-related adrenaline.

1:29:47.750 --> 1:29:48.708
Like what?

1:29:50.458 --> 1:29:51.708
I don't know.

1:29:53.333 --> 1:29:55.041
I don't know where this is going.

1:29:55.750 --> 1:29:56.916
Want to find out?

1:29:58.708 --> 1:30:00.375
Like someone once said,

1:30:01.916 --> 1:30:03.875
"Once is not going to be enough."
