00:05.339 --> 00:06.340
Previously on Hightown...

00:06.374 --> 00:08.008
Krista's friend Sherry was shot
in the head last week,

00:08.042 --> 00:10.144
and nobody gives a
fuck, no one except me.

00:10.177 --> 00:11.278
Where are you on
your white whale?

00:11.312 --> 00:13.347
Osito? About to pin
down his location.

00:13.381 --> 00:14.782
Get yourself a new informant.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.617
You just overdosed, all right?

00:17.351 --> 00:19.320
- Oh, shit!
- You fucking that cop?

00:19.353 --> 00:20.421
No.

00:20.454 --> 00:23.524
I need you to step up
and be resourceful.

00:25.459 --> 00:27.695
Donna, I want you to pack a bag.

00:28.429 --> 00:30.064
I'm getting us a hotel room.

00:30.097 --> 00:32.266
- What?
- I don't think it's gonna go
your way.

00:32.767 --> 00:34.235
Like, I'm fired?

00:34.268 --> 00:36.804
I was really fucked up,
but I got 42 days now.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.072
You need to go.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.574
I just have a few more questions
about Krista.

00:40.608 --> 00:42.109
She left this here, okay?

00:42.143 --> 00:44.412
Krista talked about some sugar
daddy up in Wareham.

00:44.445 --> 00:45.713
Anthony Delvicarrio?

00:45.746 --> 00:47.748
Yeah, he got some construction
company or something up there.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.450
Maybe she holed up with him.

02:49.236 --> 02:51.171
One of you Anthony Delvicarrio?

02:52.640 --> 02:53.641
Yeah?

02:53.674 --> 02:55.643
Can I speak to you in private?

02:56.277 --> 02:57.278
Sure.

02:57.945 --> 02:59.947
I'll be back in five, guys.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.649
Nah, who am I kidding?

03:01.682 --> 03:02.917
It'll only take two.

03:08.756 --> 03:10.691
I'm the one who
called about Krista.

03:12.726 --> 03:13.961
I don't know any Kristas.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.262
Yeah, you do.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.431
And you know where she is.

03:23.604 --> 03:25.406
This is private property.

03:25.439 --> 03:27.408
I'm gonna need you to leave.

03:27.441 --> 03:31.412
And if you call my house again,
we're gonna have problems.

03:31.445 --> 03:34.281
I'll leave as soon as you
tell me where Krista is.

03:42.790 --> 03:44.925
You want something,

03:44.959 --> 03:47.494
you're gonna have to let me
fuck your ass first.

03:47.528 --> 03:48.896
That's what Krista does.

04:00.641 --> 04:01.642
Bye-bye.

04:03.310 --> 04:04.979
See the balls on this bitch?

04:06.680 --> 04:07.848
Fuck.

04:07.881 --> 04:08.983
Fucking asshole.

04:21.962 --> 04:22.963
Hello?

04:23.597 --> 04:25.366
Hey, Jack, heads-up about...

04:27.001 --> 04:28.435
Are you driving?

04:29.336 --> 04:30.537
Of course not.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.474
They catch you driving without a
license, that's when they really
fuck you.

04:33.507 --> 04:35.542
I said I'm not driving.
Just get to the fucking point.

04:36.010 --> 04:38.812
There's a big fucking operation
in the works for tonight.

04:38.846 --> 04:41.548
Hunniker needs more bodies,
and I think I can get you on it.

04:41.582 --> 04:43.984
A BFO? Really?

04:44.018 --> 04:46.320
It's a long shot,
but what the hell?

04:46.353 --> 04:47.788
So here's what I need you to do.

04:47.821 --> 04:50.357
I need you to go home
and sit by the phone.

04:50.391 --> 04:53.360
- And don't mess this up.
- Okay. Jesus.

05:10.744 --> 05:12.746
- You guys liking the tacos?
- Oh, yeah.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.548
- Yeah? Good.
- They're really good.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.551
You really got to put
your wrist into it.

05:18.719 --> 05:19.720
Hey, you.

05:19.753 --> 05:20.888
Good to see you.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.092
What are you doing here?

05:26.026 --> 05:27.327
Man's got to eat.

05:28.896 --> 05:31.565
Yeah, I learned that last night.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.772
How do I taste?

05:39.740 --> 05:41.341
Like a spring rain.

05:43.377 --> 05:47.014
You know, not every man
enjoys that as much as you.

05:47.047 --> 05:49.483
If you're telling me
Frankie doesn't go down on you,

05:49.516 --> 05:52.019
I'm gonna have to kill him
on top of throwing him in jail.

05:58.092 --> 05:59.860
I got to go to work.

06:12.940 --> 06:15.042
- What time are you off?
- 5:00.

06:15.075 --> 06:16.443
Good.

06:24.618 --> 06:26.120
Did you play two years for BC?

06:27.454 --> 06:28.756
Wow, man!

06:30.524 --> 06:33.127
Then you got hooked
on the oxycodone, huh?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.028
- Yeah.
- Shit.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.132
You know who the
real criminals are?

06:38.165 --> 06:40.100
It's the fucking drug companies.

06:40.134 --> 06:42.102
I ain't kidding.

06:42.136 --> 06:43.137
Totally.

06:44.805 --> 06:47.641
So, hey, can I get
that in writing...

06:47.674 --> 06:49.877
like, if I snitch,
I stay out of jail?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.980
You're asking a lot
for a guy who just ran over a
cop, Ethan.

06:53.680 --> 06:54.681
All right?

06:55.783 --> 06:57.851
But why don't we
get to work here?

06:57.885 --> 06:59.720
It's time for you to
man up now, right?

06:59.753 --> 07:02.589
Tell me what you
know about Osito.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.892
I met him through a kid
I went to high school with...

07:04.925 --> 07:07.060
- Kizzle.
- And where'd you go to high
school?

07:07.694 --> 07:08.929
Nauset Regional in Eastham.

07:08.962 --> 07:11.999
Kizzle? Does Kizzle
have a real name?

07:12.032 --> 07:13.467
Sean Gandam.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.501
Skinny white kid?

07:15.169 --> 07:16.203
Wishes he wasn't?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.839
- Yeah. That's him.
- Yeah, yeah, that's him, right?

07:20.674 --> 07:21.675
This is good.

07:21.708 --> 07:23.210
This is really good.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.112
You ever consider
a career in law enforcement?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.549
I was an Eagle Scout.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.685
- So was I!
- Oh, cool. What troop were you
in?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
Osito and Kizzle.

07:39.860 --> 07:41.995
So I buy from Kizzle,
and he buys from Osito.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.497
So I met him a few times.

07:43.530 --> 07:45.132
Okay, so tell me about Osito.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.968
First thing that comes
to your mind, you know,

07:48.001 --> 07:51.004
anything you can point
out that's unusual.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.108
He had a different car
every time I saw him.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.878
I think that's, like, his thing.
I don't know where he gets them,
though.

07:57.911 --> 07:59.580
No, that's good.

07:59.613 --> 08:01.548
Different car. Anything else?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.218
Yeah, he has a kind
of hot girlfriend.

08:04.251 --> 08:05.485
I think that's weird.

08:05.519 --> 08:06.820
Kind of hot?

08:07.754 --> 08:09.189
You got a name?

08:09.223 --> 08:10.791
No. White girl, 20s.

08:11.558 --> 08:12.759
That's more than enough.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.899
Ethan, you are
really good at this.

08:19.900 --> 08:21.034
I got this idea.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.070
I think I know how you
can be a real help.

08:23.770 --> 08:26.840
Would you be willing to wear a
wire with Sean?

08:26.874 --> 08:28.842
With Kizzle?

08:28.876 --> 08:30.244
I don't know.

08:30.277 --> 08:32.179
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Look at me, look at me.

08:32.212 --> 08:33.213
Look at me.

08:33.981 --> 08:35.249
I believe in you.

08:36.583 --> 08:38.518
I know you can do this.

08:44.024 --> 08:46.894
Kizzle works HVAC and
solar installation.

08:46.927 --> 08:48.562
Usually gets off around 4:00.

08:48.595 --> 08:50.664
- Goes to this one bar.
- That's our play.

08:50.697 --> 08:51.698
I love it.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.767
You can hang out
here until then.

08:58.739 --> 09:01.275
Hey, buddy,
guess who the kid's connect is.

09:01.308 --> 09:03.143
- Surprise me.
- You're no fun at all.

09:03.944 --> 09:05.679
Sean Gandam.

09:05.712 --> 09:07.748
Get the fuck out of
here. That asshole?

09:07.781 --> 09:09.316
Punk-ass white boy
extraordinaire.

09:09.549 --> 09:11.151
- Wow, yeah.
- He's moving up in the world.

09:11.184 --> 09:13.020
So he's working for Osito now.

09:13.787 --> 09:15.122
Really?

09:15.155 --> 09:17.024
I got the kid wearing
a wire today, 4:00 p.m.

09:17.057 --> 09:18.992
Get out of here. All right!

09:19.026 --> 09:21.194
I'ma need you to go down to Auto
Theft and talk to Lou Jones,

09:21.228 --> 09:23.931
'cause the kid's saying Osito
likes to drive a different car
all the time.

09:25.132 --> 09:26.934
Check it out.
See if there's something there.

09:26.967 --> 09:28.735
- Put it together.
- I got you.

09:32.339 --> 09:33.807
A little north.

09:35.142 --> 09:36.176
Oh, no, no, no.

09:36.209 --> 09:37.978
Go back to what you
were doing before.

09:41.048 --> 09:42.883
Never mind. Just fuck me.

09:42.916 --> 09:44.651
Come here, quick, quick.
Just fuck me, just fuck me.

10:24.658 --> 10:26.126
I missed you.

10:26.159 --> 10:27.160
Yeah.

10:28.729 --> 10:30.063
Yeah, I missed you, too.

10:34.301 --> 10:36.036
What do you got going on today?

10:37.037 --> 10:38.839
Barbecue at the house.

10:38.872 --> 10:40.207
I got to get the sausages.

10:41.708 --> 10:43.677
Hey, you know what?
I can get 'em for ya.

10:43.710 --> 10:47.414
I could be, like, the sponsor of
sausages or whatever you call
it.

10:47.647 --> 10:49.783
- Padrinho.
- Padrinho, that's right.

10:49.816 --> 10:51.385
Yeah, fuck, no.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.020
You're not coming to the house.

10:53.053 --> 10:55.155
- My mom'll eat you alive.
- Hey, I don't care.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.190
As long as I'm with you.

10:57.224 --> 10:59.259
You're such a cheese-dick.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.400
They haven't seen you
since you got clean.

11:08.368 --> 11:09.669
Maybe it's time.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.372
All right.

11:22.249 --> 11:23.250
- If I don't pee...
- What?

11:23.283 --> 11:25.252
- ...I'm gonna get a UTI.
- Oh, wow.

11:25.285 --> 11:27.454
Oh, wow, that is hot.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.089
Get off me!

11:32.926 --> 11:34.294
Damn, girl.

11:48.775 --> 11:49.810
Hey.

11:49.843 --> 11:51.778
Hey, guess who got it in, son?

11:51.812 --> 11:54.114
- Donna finally take pity on
you? - Hey, Donna.

11:54.948 --> 11:56.316
Jackie thinks you just
threw me a pity fuck.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.385
- Is that true?
- Take me off speaker.

11:58.418 --> 12:00.287
No, say hi to Jackie.
Jackie, say hi.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.955
Take me off speaker!

12:01.988 --> 12:02.989
Jesus.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.926
- What are you doing?
- Looking for that girl.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.027
Don't at me, bro.

12:07.461 --> 12:08.895
Wait.

12:08.929 --> 12:10.464
Is that why you were
going to Wareham?

12:11.298 --> 12:13.133
Yeah. I think she's up here.

12:15.802 --> 12:17.737
All right, you at least
do your first step?

12:18.171 --> 12:19.506
What step is that?

12:19.739 --> 12:20.774
Well, if you have to ask,
it means you didn't.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.276
Look, if you're so bored,
why don't you go to a meeting?

12:23.310 --> 12:25.112
Nah, I'm good.

12:27.180 --> 12:29.149
So I got 47 days today.

12:31.318 --> 12:33.053
It's just the most
I've ever had.

12:36.523 --> 12:39.526
But I'm fucking struggling.

12:41.828 --> 12:42.829
It's so fucking hard.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.397
I mean, like...

12:44.431 --> 12:47.834
I'm 20-fucking-3, and
I don't have shit.

12:49.402 --> 12:53.006
My whole life, people
just leave or...

12:53.840 --> 12:55.008
...die or...

12:56.977 --> 12:58.178
...both.

13:03.016 --> 13:04.851
I lost an old friend.

13:05.852 --> 13:08.855
And I can't even talk about it.

13:13.226 --> 13:16.363
I shouldn't even be in this
town, but I got nowhere to go.

13:18.532 --> 13:21.368
I'm only here 'cause of a dude,
and he's a fucking asshole.

13:23.203 --> 13:24.838
At least he's
paying for my spot.

13:29.876 --> 13:30.877
Whatever.

13:32.879 --> 13:34.381
I should be grateful, right?

13:37.984 --> 13:39.519
I'm fucking alive.

13:51.231 --> 13:52.532
Son of a bitch.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.375
Where you going,
man? Where you going?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.279
Fuck! Fuck!

14:44.618 --> 14:47.220
- You fucking following me?
- Motherfucker, what are you
doing?

14:48.221 --> 14:50.523
- What the fuck?
- Tell me what you're doing,
bitch.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.225
You tell me where Krista is,
and I'll stop.

14:52.259 --> 14:54.661
No, wait, wait,
wait. God damn it!

14:54.894 --> 14:56.429
You know what? Fine,
I'll call your wife.

14:57.297 --> 14:58.365
You ain't got the number.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.267
I got your landline, bitch.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.936
So what? Do it.

15:02.969 --> 15:04.037
No one's home.

15:10.310 --> 15:11.645
Tell me where Krista is.

15:12.912 --> 15:14.114
You think I give a fuck
about your marriage?

15:14.147 --> 15:15.448
You tell me where Krista is!

15:17.317 --> 15:19.119
Hello?

15:19.152 --> 15:20.954
Hello?

15:20.987 --> 15:22.255
Last chance.

15:22.289 --> 15:24.557
- Hello?
- Hello, Mrs. Delviccario?

15:24.591 --> 15:26.426
Yes, this is her.

15:26.459 --> 15:28.328
Plymouth Rock Motor
Court, in Bourne.

15:30.363 --> 15:31.698
Hey, asshole, what room?

15:33.166 --> 15:34.567
40, you fucking cunt.

15:35.335 --> 15:37.137
Suck my dick.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.677
Holy shit.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.315
So then I asked him,
do you know you bought stolen
property?

15:48.348 --> 15:50.383
And guess what this
motherfucker says.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.118
- "Yeah, I know that."
- Come on.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.120
- Yeah!
- All he had to say was no.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.589
Right! Gets three years
in Concord for it.

15:56.623 --> 15:59.225
There's some dumb motherfuckers
out there, man.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.027
It's the smart ones
you got to look out for.

16:01.695 --> 16:04.097
Which brings me to why I'm here.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.466
We got this guy,
Emmanuel Delgado.

16:06.499 --> 16:08.535
Goes by Osito.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.603
Guy's a fucking ghost, man.

16:10.637 --> 16:12.339
Drives a bunch a different SUVs,

16:12.372 --> 16:14.307
but we don't know
where he's getting 'em from.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.544
Narcotics unit.
Oh, who's the sergeant over
there now?

16:17.577 --> 16:18.712
Ray Abruzzo.

16:19.979 --> 16:21.448
Ray Abruzzo?

16:21.481 --> 16:23.516
Shake my damn head.

16:23.550 --> 16:26.119
- You know Ray?
- Oh, yeah, I know him.

16:27.520 --> 16:32.392
You tell that peckerwood
I don't forget.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.786
Hey, can we talk for a sec?

17:32.819 --> 17:34.387
Excuse me.

17:34.421 --> 17:35.455
No inglés.

17:36.756 --> 17:37.757
Okay.

17:39.159 --> 17:42.395
I'm looking for the girl in room 40.

17:42.429 --> 17:44.531
I just want to return her suitcase.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.565
Can you help?

17:48.468 --> 17:49.669
Wait. Please.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.571
Por favor.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.807
I'm sorry.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.110
I've been looking for her for a while.

17:58.678 --> 18:00.113
She's in trouble.

18:00.146 --> 18:01.381
I just want to help.

18:02.315 --> 18:03.316
Por favor.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.419
I can give you two minutes.

18:06.453 --> 18:07.487
Gracias.

18:12.859 --> 18:14.160
Gracias.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.489
The girl, how is she?

18:42.522 --> 18:43.756
I don't know.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.692
You know if she's using?

18:47.193 --> 18:48.194
You know...

18:50.330 --> 18:51.464
Maybe.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.733
Yeah, maybe.

18:53.766 --> 18:54.901
Fuck.

19:17.423 --> 19:20.560
- Yeah, hello?
- Quinones, Hunniker.

19:20.593 --> 19:22.929
Tell me something,
have you been gargling Ed's
balls?

19:23.162 --> 19:24.330
What?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.766
I said, "Have you been gargling
Ed's balls?"

19:26.799 --> 19:29.302
Because he just went to bat
for you in a major way.

19:29.335 --> 19:30.904
I'm putting you on
the BFO tonight.

19:30.937 --> 19:32.872
Yes, thank you. Thank
you so much, sir.

19:32.906 --> 19:34.541
That is amazing.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.276
But you're not messing with me,
are you? Is this a joke?

19:36.743 --> 19:38.444
You fucked up royally.

19:38.478 --> 19:40.380
And you're a piece
-of-shit agent.

19:40.413 --> 19:42.515
But you're our piece
-of-shit agent.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.250
And we take care of our own.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.886
Besides, Bennett's on vacation,
and we need a body.

19:47.754 --> 19:50.390
Thank you. Thank you so much,
sir. I won't let you down.

19:56.596 --> 19:58.398
I'm just gonna leave a note.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.287
Okay. Gracias.

20:25.625 --> 20:26.659
Hey, Ed.

20:26.693 --> 20:29.362
Guess who's on her way
to a motherfucking BFO?

20:29.395 --> 20:30.763
Yeah!

20:33.833 --> 20:35.868
Girls, have you
seen Mackayleigh?

20:35.902 --> 20:37.704
Mackayleigh, do
you want to say hi?

20:37.737 --> 20:39.806
- Are you ready? Let's go. You
good? - I'm good, I'm good.

20:39.839 --> 20:41.641
- Okay.
- Hi!

20:42.809 --> 20:43.943
Can you grab that for me?

20:43.977 --> 20:45.645
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Thank you, thank you.

20:45.678 --> 20:47.246
Appreciate it. Okay.

20:47.280 --> 20:48.281
All right.

20:50.483 --> 20:52.285
- Hey, honey.
- Sorry we're late, Dad.

20:52.318 --> 20:53.786
- That's all right.
- Come on, girls.

20:58.324 --> 20:59.826
Hey, I brought sausages.

21:01.494 --> 21:02.629
Is that it?

21:02.662 --> 21:04.831
- What?
- I said, "Is that it?"

21:05.765 --> 21:07.634
Oh, snap.

21:07.667 --> 21:09.402
I can run out to the store.
Just tell me how much.

21:09.435 --> 21:11.471
Jesus, kid, I'm just
busting your balls.

21:11.504 --> 21:12.772
It's good to see you again.

21:12.805 --> 21:14.507
Okay, yeah. You too.

21:15.842 --> 21:18.277
- That wasn't that bad, right?
- He was the easy one.

21:18.311 --> 21:20.713
My mom thought you were a fuck
-up even before you were fucking
up.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.649
- All right, give her to me.
- You should go say hi.

21:22.682 --> 21:24.484
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay.

21:24.517 --> 21:25.551
All right, I got this.

21:25.585 --> 21:26.853
Absolutely.

21:33.292 --> 21:34.827
Hello, Mrs. B.

21:34.861 --> 21:36.529
Long time no see.

21:36.562 --> 21:38.031
Want to say hi to Nana?

21:41.067 --> 21:42.368
Yeah.

21:44.070 --> 21:45.838
Look, I just wanted to say
thanks for having me

21:45.872 --> 21:49.809
and, you know,
and also, I know it's weird,

21:49.842 --> 21:52.011
'cause, you know, you haven't
seen me in a while,

21:52.045 --> 21:54.580
and I was in pretty
rough shape last time,

21:54.614 --> 21:57.517
but I'm better now, so...

21:57.550 --> 22:00.353
If there's anything I can do
to make it up to you, let me
know.

22:00.386 --> 22:02.655
You don't owe me
anything, Junior.

22:05.058 --> 22:06.359
Okay, thanks.

22:07.060 --> 22:08.695
Hi!

22:08.728 --> 22:11.531
You love your nana, don't you?

22:11.564 --> 22:15.535
Did you know that it was your
nana who held you first?

22:15.568 --> 22:17.537
Yes, that's right,

22:17.570 --> 22:21.741
because your own daddy
didn't show up at the hospital.

22:24.577 --> 22:25.912
Sorry. I should go.

22:25.945 --> 22:28.081
No, no. Stay.

22:29.082 --> 22:30.750
Have a sausage.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.141
- Hi.
- Hey.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.076
I filled the tank,
squeegee'd the windows.

22:57.110 --> 23:00.046
I checked the tires.
I threw out your trash.

23:00.079 --> 23:01.581
Yeah, I feel like
there's something else coming.

23:02.448 --> 23:04.617
Maybe a slightly
broken headlight.

23:04.650 --> 23:06.853
- What?
- I know, I know, it's fine.

23:06.886 --> 23:07.887
I will pay for it.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.455
I swear, and...

23:10.423 --> 23:12.892
I'm sorry for getting
back on my bullshit.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.529
Who is this woman?

23:16.562 --> 23:19.098
She just said "sorry" twice
in the past two days,

23:19.132 --> 23:20.700
so I know it can't be Jackie.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.602
I mean it.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.803
I am sorry.

23:25.471 --> 23:28.608
And if there's anything
I can do to make it up to you,

23:28.641 --> 23:32.979
you know, for all of
it, you let me know.

23:36.816 --> 23:38.651
You want to come in?

23:41.988 --> 23:43.122
I can't.

23:43.156 --> 23:44.457
I can't.

23:44.490 --> 23:46.626
It's not that I don't
want to, I just...

23:46.659 --> 23:48.861
- I...
- Okay.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.665
How about dinner tomorrow?

23:53.833 --> 23:55.168
Like a date?

23:55.835 --> 23:57.136
Yeah.

23:57.170 --> 23:58.671
Yeah, like a date.

23:59.839 --> 24:03.176
I'll bring roses,
wine, the whole nine.

24:07.713 --> 24:09.182
Things are gonna be different.

24:13.519 --> 24:14.520
Yeah.

24:32.705 --> 24:33.806
Tomorrow.

24:33.840 --> 24:34.941
Okay.

24:36.042 --> 24:37.176
Bye.

25:16.749 --> 25:18.551
- Yeah, what?
- What the fuck?

25:18.584 --> 25:20.686
Did you tell
someone where I was?

25:20.720 --> 25:23.089
I'm only answering
so I can tell you this once.

25:24.123 --> 25:26.525
Some bitch was looking for you.

25:26.559 --> 25:29.729
She called my fucking wife,
so you and me,

25:29.762 --> 25:31.898
we're done, you hear me?

25:31.931 --> 25:33.766
Don't call this number again.

25:53.786 --> 25:56.322
Alan, come on, man.
Ready to do this?

25:56.555 --> 25:58.925
- Give this to Patty?
- All right.

26:01.093 --> 26:02.094
What?

26:02.128 --> 26:05.765
Just want you to know
you're not as smart as you think
you are.

26:05.798 --> 26:07.133
What's that supposed to mean?

26:08.134 --> 26:09.635
Lou Jones.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.305
Lou Jones?

26:12.338 --> 26:15.174
Lou Jones, the only black dude
in Auto Theft?

26:15.207 --> 26:17.843
What, you just thought he was
gonna hook a brother up or
something?

26:17.877 --> 26:19.946
Oh, that, yeah.

26:19.979 --> 26:21.781
He just doesn't like
me for some reason.

26:21.814 --> 26:23.649
I just figured you'd
have better luck.

26:23.683 --> 26:25.284
Being black was just a bonus.

26:25.318 --> 26:27.286
A bonus? All right, okay.

26:27.320 --> 26:28.621
That's a first.

26:28.654 --> 26:30.656
Yeah, "being black was a bonus."

26:31.991 --> 26:34.627
- What'd you do to him anyway?
- Don't worry about that.

26:34.660 --> 26:36.829
Hey, buddy. Man of the hour.
How you doing?

26:38.164 --> 26:39.832
Hey, guys, I got him from here.

26:40.833 --> 26:42.668
- Doing all right?
- Yeah, I guess.

26:42.702 --> 26:44.804
Good, good. So here's the deal.

26:44.837 --> 26:46.605
We're gonna show up
a few minutes early.

26:46.639 --> 26:48.140
You're gonna call me
on your cell phone.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.042
I'm gonna answer,
and you're just gonna leave it
on.

26:50.076 --> 26:52.345
That way, we can hear
everything that's going on.

26:52.378 --> 26:53.980
We'll be right outside
in the car, all right?

26:54.013 --> 26:55.014
Sure.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.750
You're gonna tell Kizzle
you want to move weight.

26:57.783 --> 27:00.386
And then you're gonna bring
the conversation back to Osito.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.656
If you get the name
of his hot girlfriend, all the
better.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.659
Hey.

27:08.194 --> 27:09.695
We believe in you, son.

27:10.863 --> 27:11.864
Yeah.

27:13.199 --> 27:15.067
All right. Go get 'em.

27:29.882 --> 27:32.218
- What, your vagina hurt?
- Nah, I'm straight.

27:33.919 --> 27:36.389
So I was hoping to
move some weight.

27:37.223 --> 27:38.391
Can you hook me up?

27:39.992 --> 27:41.727
You know who I ran into?

27:41.761 --> 27:44.063
That chick
from Nauset Regional, Emily
Broder.

27:44.096 --> 27:45.865
That girl you liked senior year?

27:45.898 --> 27:47.233
How's she looking?

27:48.234 --> 27:50.069
I wouldn't fuck her
with your dick now.

27:50.903 --> 27:51.904
Yeah.

27:58.244 --> 28:00.246
You used to be a player.

28:00.279 --> 28:02.415
Breaking hearts all
across the Cape.

28:03.249 --> 28:04.683
I did all right.

28:07.086 --> 28:09.388
You know who's smoking hot?

28:09.422 --> 28:11.357
That chick Osito hangs with.

28:12.291 --> 28:13.793
What was her name?

28:13.826 --> 28:16.729
- What?
- You know, Osito's girl.

28:16.762 --> 28:18.764
Why you asking about her?

28:20.132 --> 28:21.367
I don't know.

28:23.102 --> 28:24.303
"I don't know."

28:24.336 --> 28:26.405
Fucking retard.

28:26.439 --> 28:27.773
What the fuck was that about?

28:28.941 --> 28:30.476
Just let the kid get warmed up.

28:33.112 --> 28:34.447
So you ever tap that?

28:35.815 --> 28:38.117
- Who?
- Emily Broder.

28:38.784 --> 28:39.785
No.

28:40.286 --> 28:42.121
Sure about that?

28:42.154 --> 28:44.290
I mean, I don't think so.

28:45.458 --> 28:49.261
So are you gonna hook me up,
or should I just, like, text
Osito myself?

28:49.295 --> 28:52.331
Why the fuck you keep asking
about Osito? You trying to get
with his girl?

28:52.364 --> 28:53.966
No, I don't even know her name.

28:54.800 --> 28:56.102
What was her name, again?

28:56.969 --> 28:59.872
What the fuck is wrong with you?
You only fuck other guys' girls.

28:59.905 --> 29:02.241
- What?
- Don't front, fuck-o.

29:02.274 --> 29:05.077
I know you smashed
Emily. She told me.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.746
I really don't think that I...

29:11.183 --> 29:12.918
- Shit.
- Shit.

29:12.952 --> 29:13.986
We're on the move.

29:15.488 --> 29:16.922
We're not blowing
our fucking cover here.

29:16.956 --> 29:19.959
That kid was all-state.
He can handle Sean Gandam.

29:22.194 --> 29:23.796
Open the goddamn door.

29:29.869 --> 29:31.370
What's up, player?

29:35.274 --> 29:36.475
Stop! Stop!

29:36.509 --> 29:38.978
You're a real fucking
piece of shit, Ray.

29:39.845 --> 29:41.881
What the fuck is up now, bitch?

29:41.914 --> 29:43.516
You sorry?

29:43.549 --> 29:46.051
State Police. Get
the fuck off him!

29:46.085 --> 29:47.353
Oh, what the fuck?

29:49.255 --> 29:51.056
- Let go of me, man!
- Still!

29:51.090 --> 29:52.424
Get off me!

29:52.458 --> 29:54.360
Shit. Hey, hey, hey.

29:54.393 --> 29:55.561
Give him to me, give him to me.

29:55.794 --> 29:56.896
- Huh? Scumbag.
- Give him to me.

29:56.929 --> 29:58.164
Hey, buddy, look
at me, look at me.

29:58.197 --> 30:01.033
You remember me? We got
eyewitnesses here who say you
were the aggressor.

30:01.066 --> 30:03.002
So guess what, asshole,
you're going to jail for
assault.

30:03.035 --> 30:04.870
Thanks for that
disturbance call.

30:07.173 --> 30:10.509
All right, everybody,
have a nice night, party on.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.213
Here we go.

30:15.881 --> 30:16.882
All right.

30:17.550 --> 30:19.919
Hey. Hey.

30:19.952 --> 30:23.222
I'm gonna send a car around,
take you home, okay?

30:24.056 --> 30:25.558
Did I do good?

30:26.292 --> 30:27.927
I didn't hit him back.

30:27.960 --> 30:30.062
Yeah, you did good.

30:38.237 --> 30:39.405
Hey, guys?

30:48.914 --> 30:50.115
There's my girl!

30:50.149 --> 30:52.051
Oh, fuck off, Ed.

30:52.084 --> 30:53.586
Look what I got for you.

30:56.922 --> 30:59.391
Wow, picked my
uniform up for me?

30:59.425 --> 31:01.160
- I was going there anyway.
- Thanks.

31:01.927 --> 31:03.128
And...

31:11.003 --> 31:12.004
Wow.

31:13.439 --> 31:14.607
Shit.

31:17.443 --> 31:19.144
Are you gonna fucking cry?

31:20.079 --> 31:21.080
No.

31:21.113 --> 31:24.583
Come on, you better get changed
up before Hunniker sees you in
your civvies.

31:24.617 --> 31:26.118
Thanks, Ed.

31:28.320 --> 31:30.256
Yo, Kizzle.

31:31.657 --> 31:34.593
K-I-Z-Z-L-E.

31:34.627 --> 31:36.629
That's the best you got?

31:36.662 --> 31:39.398
Hey, I remember when you used to
lift golf balls from the country
club.

31:41.200 --> 31:44.136
Now we got your ass for assault
with a deadly weapon.

31:45.304 --> 31:47.306
I didn't have no weapon on me.

31:47.339 --> 31:51.076
See, kicking a man in the head
turns your Timberlands into
baseball bats.

31:51.110 --> 31:53.912
Yeah. That's five years minimum.

31:53.946 --> 31:55.914
We're not talking County time.

31:55.948 --> 31:57.650
Talking about prison, baby.

31:58.384 --> 32:03.122
Lockdowns, gangs, brown people.

32:04.290 --> 32:09.028
Look, do you really wanna do
five years over some stupid
barroom beef?

32:09.061 --> 32:10.329
Over what, some pussy?

32:11.664 --> 32:14.199
Be smart for the first time
in your life, Sean.

32:14.233 --> 32:15.968
Why don't you just tell us
what you know about Osito?

32:16.969 --> 32:18.570
I don't know that dude.

32:19.271 --> 32:21.073
You know anything
about a murder down in Truro?

32:24.076 --> 32:25.077
Nope.

32:25.110 --> 32:28.314
Oh, shit, Ray, I think
we got us a live one here.

32:28.347 --> 32:29.481
I got to be honest with you...

32:29.515 --> 32:32.351
I didn't think he knew anything
about a fucking murder, but...

32:32.384 --> 32:34.153
He's a shitty fucking liar.

32:34.186 --> 32:36.455
Yeah, he is. Talk to us, Sean.

32:36.488 --> 32:38.457
Where were you
Thursday, August 22nd?

32:38.490 --> 32:41.393
- I want a lawyer.
- Don't be such a fucking pussy,
man.

32:41.427 --> 32:42.661
Look at you.

32:42.695 --> 32:45.197
Look, I'm trying to help you out
right now, hear your side a
things.

32:45.230 --> 32:47.132
Be smart. Talk to us.

32:47.166 --> 32:48.400
I said I want a lawyer.

32:48.434 --> 32:50.736
Listen to me,
you piece-of-shit Eminem
motherfucker.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.971
If you know anything about the
murder of Sherry Henry,

32:53.005 --> 32:54.573
why don't you just talk
about it right now?

32:54.606 --> 32:56.542
Get it off your chest,
'cause let me tell you
something.

32:56.575 --> 32:59.678
Nobody's gonna ride tall
for your stupid fucking ass.

32:59.712 --> 33:01.447
Osito, he don't even
fucking like you.

33:01.480 --> 33:03.682
Frankie, he don't even know
you fucking exist.

33:04.550 --> 33:07.119
- Spill it, motherfucker!
- I want an attorney!

33:08.153 --> 33:09.588
Christ! Ray, Ray!

33:09.621 --> 33:12.691
- Ray, Ray, Ray...
- You fucked up already!

33:12.725 --> 33:16.195
- You see that in here? Police
brutality! - Come on, sit your
ass down.

33:16.228 --> 33:19.031
Sit your ass down, down!

33:20.466 --> 33:21.734
A word?

33:32.745 --> 33:35.214
What the fuck was
that about, huh?

33:35.247 --> 33:38.584
You really think that Sean
Gandam is fucking pulling
bodies?

33:38.617 --> 33:41.053
I don't know.
Probably fucking not, but he...

33:41.086 --> 33:43.555
he knows something
about Sherry, man.

33:43.589 --> 33:45.657
Sherry? What is it
with you and Sherry?

33:47.226 --> 33:49.294
You know what?
I don't even want to fucking
know.

33:49.328 --> 33:50.329
You know why?

33:50.362 --> 33:53.098
'Cause I'm a happily married man
just trying to make a living.

33:53.132 --> 33:55.734
Now, if you want to fucking get
written up for violating the
civil liberties

33:55.768 --> 33:59.104
of this piece-of-shit white boy,
you fucking leave me out of it!

33:59.138 --> 34:01.073
It's called working
the case, Alan.

34:01.106 --> 34:03.409
Then work the
motherfucker, then.

34:03.442 --> 34:06.578
You understand?
While we got him locked up for
ag assault.

34:06.612 --> 34:09.782
That way, if something comes
back on him, you know where he's
at.

34:13.619 --> 34:14.820
Now what?

34:19.691 --> 34:22.060
You know what? You're right.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.095
Do it.

34:23.829 --> 34:24.830
Do what?

34:25.464 --> 34:27.533
Where the fuck you going?

34:29.334 --> 34:30.803
Son of a bitch!

34:47.386 --> 34:48.754
Plymouth Rock Motor Court.

34:48.787 --> 34:51.857
Hi, yeah. Room 40, please.

35:19.218 --> 35:20.819
Scotty, who the fuck is that?

35:30.362 --> 35:32.498
- You Scotty?
- Yeah.

35:33.532 --> 35:34.867
Are you holding?

35:57.890 --> 35:59.391
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:28.420 --> 36:30.222
No, Frankie's sleeping in there.

36:30.255 --> 36:31.323
Okay.

36:51.777 --> 36:52.811
Hey.

36:53.612 --> 36:55.881
- Are you married?
- No.

36:57.649 --> 36:59.318
I mean, I was.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.619
Not anymore.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.456
Kids?

37:06.959 --> 37:08.694
Yes, I have a son.

37:08.727 --> 37:09.861
He's 17.

37:11.530 --> 37:15.467
He took it hard when his mom and
I split and chose her.

37:16.969 --> 37:19.538
I see him sometimes.

37:25.477 --> 37:28.313
I was still getting high
when I was pregnant.

37:31.416 --> 37:35.821
So not exactly
mom of the year over here.

37:39.257 --> 37:40.726
How'd you quit?

37:44.963 --> 37:48.000
I just made a
decision one day...

37:49.301 --> 37:50.836
...that wasn't gonna be me.

37:51.970 --> 37:53.505
It's not you.

38:03.749 --> 38:06.451
Remember when I was your snitch?

38:08.987 --> 38:11.356
Yeah, you mean like yesterday?

38:17.863 --> 38:19.798
That's over now, okay?

38:20.866 --> 38:22.501
I mean it.

38:22.534 --> 38:25.871
Yeah. It's over.

38:26.872 --> 38:27.873
Okay.

38:41.553 --> 38:43.655
Besides, I got all I need.

38:44.556 --> 38:46.058
I got all I need.

38:46.091 --> 38:47.793
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.731
I know all about Osito...

38:53.899 --> 38:55.400
...and his cars...

38:56.568 --> 38:57.936
...his hot white girlfriend.

38:57.969 --> 38:59.404
Kathleen's not that hot.

39:00.372 --> 39:01.973
Somebody's jealous.

39:02.007 --> 39:03.408
I'm not jealous.

39:04.609 --> 39:06.511
Please, okay? She's just...

39:07.412 --> 39:08.714
I don't know. I don't get it.

39:09.581 --> 39:10.782
She's, like, normal.

39:10.816 --> 39:12.751
- Normal?
- You know.

39:13.418 --> 39:15.087
She's cute, and...

39:15.921 --> 39:19.925
...her dad owns that big auto
body shop in Yarmouth,
O'Donnell's.

39:21.593 --> 39:24.730
And I guess Osito
has that good dick.

39:26.431 --> 39:28.500
Oh, now you're jealous?

39:29.101 --> 39:30.736
- Me? No.
- Yeah.

39:30.769 --> 39:33.772
'Cause I mean, of course...

39:35.407 --> 39:37.609
...not as good as yours.

39:55.460 --> 39:56.628
Who is it?

39:59.631 --> 40:00.832
Is that Frankie?

40:02.134 --> 40:03.969
You don't have to answer that.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.504
I do, okay?

40:05.537 --> 40:07.139
He knows my schedule.

40:10.876 --> 40:13.145
You really want to have
this conversation right now?

40:14.479 --> 40:15.480
No.

40:15.514 --> 40:16.515
I don't.

40:18.850 --> 40:20.652
Don't, Ray.

40:21.153 --> 40:22.187
Please...

40:27.993 --> 40:31.163
This is a call from the
Massachusetts State Correctional
Facility.

40:31.196 --> 40:33.565
- The caller is...
- Frankie Cuevas.

40:33.598 --> 40:35.500
Push 7 to block this call.

40:35.534 --> 40:36.668
Push 5...

40:38.503 --> 40:39.504
Frankie.

40:39.538 --> 40:40.672
Hey.

40:41.173 --> 40:42.507
Hey.

40:43.175 --> 40:45.944
Listen, about that thing...

40:45.977 --> 40:49.147
No, no. Not on the phone.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.885
Is Frankie there?

40:53.919 --> 40:55.487
I just...

40:55.520 --> 40:57.556
I want to hear him breathe.

41:20.045 --> 41:21.680
Do you hear that?

41:22.214 --> 41:24.516
He's snoring a little.

41:24.549 --> 41:27.252
It's okay, baby.
Daddy's on the phone.

41:29.054 --> 41:30.222
I miss you.

41:31.256 --> 41:33.058
I miss you so much.

41:48.940 --> 41:50.909
What the fuck are
you doing, Ray?

42:16.101 --> 42:18.570
Oh, look what the
cat dragged in.

42:18.603 --> 42:20.205
Jesus, this room
smells like old balls.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.873
Open a window,
for Christ's sake.

42:21.907 --> 42:24.009
Well, yeah, Ed's balls.
They've been around since the
dawn of man.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.176
Ain't that right, Eddie?

42:25.210 --> 42:27.712
At least I wash
mine, you grimy fuck.

42:28.280 --> 42:30.615
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come on, let's get to work.

42:30.649 --> 42:32.851
And as you gentlemen can see,
Quinones is back,

42:32.884 --> 42:35.754
so don't forget
to put the toilet seat down.

42:35.787 --> 42:38.056
Okay, here we go.
Eastern Bourne.

42:38.089 --> 42:41.326
Some dickheads are dragging for
clams in a contaminated red tide
zone.

42:41.559 --> 42:43.561
So we got to go out
and play fish police.

42:43.595 --> 42:45.931
We'll take the 32
-foot response boats.

42:45.964 --> 42:48.700
Stark, you're gonna send up a
drone with forward-looking
infrared.

42:49.134 --> 42:50.969
I'll be running operations here.

42:51.002 --> 42:52.304
We need prima facie,

42:52.337 --> 42:54.606
so don't move on 'em
until the dredge is on deck.

42:54.639 --> 42:57.108
Then NOVA their asses.

42:57.142 --> 42:58.944
Any questions?

42:58.977 --> 43:00.745
- No.
- Let's roll out.

43:30.942 --> 43:32.844
Hey, come on, dance with us.

43:33.845 --> 43:34.846
Got to take this.

43:34.879 --> 43:36.247
Oh, nice try.

43:36.281 --> 43:37.849
Be right back. Sorry.

43:39.184 --> 43:41.019
J, we need to talk.

43:42.020 --> 43:43.388
I can't.

43:43.621 --> 43:45.790
- I'm at my baby mama's.
- I know.

43:45.824 --> 43:47.092
Your mom told me.

43:47.859 --> 43:49.094
I'm out front.

44:10.648 --> 44:12.384
- What's up?
- What's up?

44:13.218 --> 44:15.787
You know anything about a girl
named Krista Collins?

44:17.288 --> 44:18.723
Nah. Why?

44:20.058 --> 44:22.027
Boy of mine got a girl in rehab.

44:22.060 --> 44:24.863
Said some woman came by
asking about Krista.

44:24.896 --> 44:27.699
Think she might know something
about that thing happened out in
Truro.

44:27.732 --> 44:29.067
What, like a witness?

44:36.408 --> 44:39.077
Hold up, O. You
were there, yeah?

44:41.346 --> 44:42.414
You see anyone?

44:44.082 --> 44:45.917
- Nah.
- Well, there you go.

44:45.950 --> 44:48.753
Look, I don't know
who this girl is, right?

44:48.787 --> 44:50.822
But I know you can't trust
anyone in rehab.

44:50.855 --> 44:52.690
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I been there.

44:52.724 --> 44:55.860
Heads be fiending, do or say
whatever to get dope from the
outside.

44:57.762 --> 44:59.030
My boy said she wanted money.

44:59.064 --> 45:00.065
Yeah.

45:01.266 --> 45:03.768
See? Bitch is trifling.

45:04.335 --> 45:07.272
Ain't no witness. Trust me.

45:10.942 --> 45:11.943
Maybe.

45:14.245 --> 45:15.280
Maybe not.

45:16.781 --> 45:17.949
We'll find out.

45:38.336 --> 45:40.839
All teams, report
your status, over.

45:42.807 --> 45:44.275
Yeah, got eyes out.

45:44.309 --> 45:46.478
Approaching the
stakeout point, roger.

45:47.312 --> 45:48.446
Yeah, Stark here.

45:48.480 --> 45:50.882
Proceeding
to the drone launch coordinates.

45:50.915 --> 45:53.885
We got eyes out and no pirates.

45:56.321 --> 45:58.123
What is wrong with him?

45:58.156 --> 46:00.125
You know Ron loves you.

46:00.158 --> 46:01.960
He's just showing off.

46:01.993 --> 46:04.329
Yeah, well, he's barking up
the wrong lesbian.

46:06.464 --> 46:08.133
Good God, I'm glad you're back.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.274
Hey, Stark, you
live on the drone?

46:16.307 --> 46:18.543
Give me five,

46:18.776 --> 46:21.012
four, three,

46:21.045 --> 46:22.046
two...

46:23.014 --> 46:24.782
And we are up, milady.

46:25.517 --> 46:27.185
Should have picture now.

46:28.019 --> 46:30.488
All right, I got something,
southeast about one klick.

46:30.522 --> 46:32.790
Can we go a little
closer on the drone?

46:32.824 --> 46:34.192
Yeah, copy.

46:38.863 --> 46:40.865
There we go.
I think we found our jackholes.

46:42.867 --> 46:45.336
This is Delta 2.
We got eyes on a 40-footer

46:45.370 --> 46:48.106
about half a mile
east of our location, over.

46:48.139 --> 46:50.175
Stark's team issues
the citation.

46:50.208 --> 46:51.910
Delta 2 provides cover.

46:51.943 --> 46:54.145
Cocksucker really wants me
in the penalty box.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.180
Notice of violation.

46:55.213 --> 46:57.515
These assholes will be back out
on the water first thing in the
morning.

46:57.549 --> 46:59.284
Okay, they're
firing up the motor.

46:59.317 --> 47:00.818
Stark's team proceed.

47:00.852 --> 47:02.554
Hey, roger that.
We're on the move.

47:03.221 --> 47:04.856
Wait, hold up, hold up.

47:04.889 --> 47:07.125
Quinones? What the fuck?

47:07.158 --> 47:09.227
The suspect with the
limp. I know him.

47:09.260 --> 47:11.262
That's Gustavo
Silva's nephew, Jorge.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.998
Idiot shot himself in the hip
last year hunting wild turkey.

47:15.133 --> 47:17.902
Gustavo Silva? The Scrodfather?

47:18.436 --> 47:21.406
Listen, Jorge fishes
out of Newport, Rhode Island.

47:21.439 --> 47:24.375
If we follow him home,
we got a federal case.

47:24.409 --> 47:25.944
Maybe he even
flips on his uncle.

47:26.945 --> 47:30.048
Or we follow the
plan, move in now.

47:30.081 --> 47:31.482
We go catch the rest
of the Sox game.

47:31.516 --> 47:34.552
Seriously? You want to write
notices of violation for the
rest of your life?

47:34.586 --> 47:36.387
We got a chance at
a real case here.

47:36.421 --> 47:38.856
Or, you know,
we could do business as usual

47:38.890 --> 47:40.592
and be back out here tomorrow.

47:40.625 --> 47:43.261
So what's it gonna be?
You want to make a fucking case?

47:43.294 --> 47:45.597
He's pulling up anchor.
I need an order here.

47:46.598 --> 47:48.399
Anchor's coming up.

47:48.433 --> 47:50.201
Looks like you're
going to Rhode Island.

47:50.935 --> 47:52.437
Roger that!

47:56.608 --> 47:58.343
So what the fuck was that?

47:58.376 --> 48:01.379
- What?
- Since when do you want to work
late?

48:01.412 --> 48:02.614
People change.

49:01.005 --> 49:02.273
Hey.

49:05.176 --> 49:06.511
Hey, buddy.

49:07.345 --> 49:08.346
Hey!

49:09.981 --> 49:10.982
How you doing?

49:11.949 --> 49:13.384
Store is closed.

49:13.418 --> 49:14.986
You didn't see the sign?

49:15.019 --> 49:17.121
I just must have missed it.

49:17.155 --> 49:18.990
Yeah. Come back tomorrow.

49:19.023 --> 49:23.361
Say, you know if Mr. O'Donnell,
will he be in tomorrow morning?

49:24.362 --> 49:26.230
What you need?

49:40.044 --> 49:41.512
What's the best way
to fix a check-engine light

49:41.546 --> 49:43.214
without going to the dealership?

49:47.452 --> 49:49.220
Bang on the dashboard.

49:54.225 --> 49:55.393
For real, though.

49:56.494 --> 49:58.563
Dealerships is a
shakedown hustle.

50:00.398 --> 50:02.734
Charge you a note just
to crack the hood.

50:03.568 --> 50:05.370
Won't even wash your car.

50:05.403 --> 50:06.537
Truth.

50:06.571 --> 50:08.740
And I take offense to that shit.

50:11.342 --> 50:13.244
Ain't like the old days.

50:13.277 --> 50:14.579
For real, bro.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.586
Why don't you bring
your car in the morning?

50:22.553 --> 50:24.422
Have my man Javi hook you up.

50:25.590 --> 50:26.591
Yeah.

50:28.426 --> 50:30.061
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

50:32.230 --> 50:33.398
Cool.

50:37.402 --> 50:38.770
What kind of car you driving?

50:43.608 --> 50:45.610
An old piece-of-shit Dodge.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.613
I'll tell you what I'm driving.

50:49.680 --> 50:51.449
Dark-gray Escalade.

50:52.417 --> 50:54.585
License plate 21FC19.

50:57.622 --> 51:00.124
Make it easier for you
when you tailing my ass.

51:23.314 --> 51:24.782
Fuck!

51:24.816 --> 51:26.451
Fuck! Fucking shit, run!

51:26.484 --> 51:29.353
National Marine and Fishery
Services, motherfucker!

51:29.387 --> 51:32.356
Federal agents! Let
me see your hands!

51:32.390 --> 51:34.091
- On your knees!
- Don't even think about it,
Jorge!

51:34.125 --> 51:35.660
Get on the ground!
On the ground!

51:38.162 --> 51:39.330
Fuck, yeah!

51:42.166 --> 51:43.167
Get up.

51:44.402 --> 51:45.837
That a way, Jackie!

51:53.144 --> 51:54.612
Hey, shut up, shut up, shut up.

51:54.645 --> 51:56.814
Tonight wasn't a BFO.

51:56.848 --> 51:58.850
No, no, tonight...

51:59.817 --> 52:02.320
...was a fucking UFO!

52:02.353 --> 52:03.654
Hey?

52:03.688 --> 52:05.723
"Huge" starts with an H,
you fucking idiot.

52:05.756 --> 52:07.892
- Yeah, fuck you.
- All right, I'm out of here,
everybody.

52:08.125 --> 52:09.694
- Where you going?
- Wait, wait, wait.

52:09.727 --> 52:12.497
- Wait, you leaving?
- I can't drink that much
anymore.

52:12.530 --> 52:15.166
- My prostate.
- Ed.

52:15.199 --> 52:16.334
All right, well...

52:18.369 --> 52:19.637
...wish me luck with Hunniker.

52:19.670 --> 52:20.838
Oh, good luck.

52:20.872 --> 52:22.907
Oh, and if he does let you back,

52:23.140 --> 52:26.277
you're doing the paperwork
for the BFO, all of it.

52:27.378 --> 52:28.713
Thanks, sweetheart.

52:30.715 --> 52:32.383
Shots!

52:33.351 --> 52:34.385
Hi.

52:34.418 --> 52:35.887
Hey.

52:35.920 --> 52:37.488
Here you go.

52:37.522 --> 52:38.890
Thanks for putting me on.

52:41.192 --> 52:42.560
You did all right.

52:43.928 --> 52:46.764
So what do you say?
Am I back on the job?

52:48.366 --> 52:50.368
Look, I'd love to,

52:50.401 --> 52:52.904
but if you don't have a license,
it's not gonna work.

52:54.639 --> 52:57.275
Yeah, but my trial
is in, like, a month.

52:57.308 --> 52:59.176
We'd reassess after that.

52:59.210 --> 53:01.412
And until then, Ed'll
drive my ass around.

53:02.213 --> 53:04.916
Come on, I got you Jorge Silva.
What more do you want?

53:11.188 --> 53:12.356
Okay.

53:12.390 --> 53:14.892
But any more bullshit,
and you're SOL.

53:14.926 --> 53:16.727
And I fucking mean it.

53:16.761 --> 53:19.263
So is that... That's a yes?

53:19.297 --> 53:20.431
Yes.

53:20.464 --> 53:22.633
I am back, motherfuckers!

53:22.667 --> 53:23.668
Thank you.

53:23.701 --> 53:25.636
- I am back!
- Oh, she's back!

53:25.670 --> 53:26.671
You're back!

53:29.407 --> 53:30.908
Down, put me down, Stark.

53:30.942 --> 53:32.343
Down.

53:38.749 --> 53:39.951
You still sulking?

53:40.985 --> 53:42.453
I'm not sulking.

53:44.855 --> 53:45.856
Hey.

53:46.791 --> 53:48.459
Hey, look at me.

53:49.460 --> 53:51.495
It doesn't matter
what my mother thinks.

53:51.529 --> 53:54.231
She's a bitch,
and she has no right to judge.

53:54.265 --> 53:56.367
There's only one person
that can judge you, and
that's...

53:56.400 --> 53:57.401
God?

53:57.935 --> 53:59.637
Fuck God.

54:00.471 --> 54:01.472
It's me...

54:02.473 --> 54:03.808
...the mother of your kid.

54:06.811 --> 54:07.979
And I forgive you.

54:21.826 --> 54:22.994
Come on, let's get out of here.

54:24.662 --> 54:26.330
I'll go get the baby.

54:55.426 --> 54:57.695
- Hey.
- What's going on?

54:59.530 --> 55:02.299
I got my gun and badge back.
I crushed a BFO.

55:02.333 --> 55:04.502
And I fucking found her, man.

55:04.535 --> 55:06.671
- What?
- I found Krista.

55:08.539 --> 55:09.874
What'd she say?

55:09.907 --> 55:11.509
Well, I mean, I didn't
find her find her.

55:11.542 --> 55:14.311
I'm waiting for her to call me
back, but I fucking rock.

55:16.347 --> 55:18.549
Yeah, that's great.

55:19.383 --> 55:22.887
Well, when you find her,
let me know what she says.

55:22.920 --> 55:24.555
What am I, your
fucking secretary?

55:24.588 --> 55:25.790
Say hi to the girls.

55:41.739 --> 55:44.875
They say don't get high
on your own supply.

55:44.909 --> 55:46.911
So that's why I
just take a taste.

55:49.814 --> 55:52.583
I know it's never
gonna feel this good again.

55:53.918 --> 55:57.922
But the first time
after you've been clean for a
while...

55:58.923 --> 56:01.425
...holy shit.

56:04.095 --> 56:07.031
Like, I don't even
fucking shoot it, bro.

56:08.766 --> 56:11.102
Fuck it. I deserve to feel good.

56:15.139 --> 56:16.941
My friend died.

56:17.942 --> 56:20.778
I'm super fucked up about it.

56:23.114 --> 56:24.115
Yeah?

56:32.456 --> 56:34.625
I fucking saw it, too.

56:37.762 --> 56:39.630
It was mad fucked up.

56:44.401 --> 56:45.970
My girl Sherry.

56:48.472 --> 56:51.642
But, Scotty, you
can't tell anybody.

56:56.814 --> 56:58.449
You got it.

56:58.482 --> 57:00.951
Oh, if it isn't the
woman of the hour.

57:00.985 --> 57:02.620
Still not fucking you, Ron.

57:02.653 --> 57:03.821
Your loss.

57:05.422 --> 57:06.757
To Jackie.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.826
- To Jackie.
- The rest of us.

57:08.859 --> 57:10.494
Hear hear, hear hear.
