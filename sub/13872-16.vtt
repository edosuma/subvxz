00:06.306 --> 00:10.606
Gentlemen, there's a chance
this will work.

00:10.877 --> 00:13.607
Actually, sir, there's no chance
this will work.

00:15.215 --> 00:17.342
Fool. That will never work!

00:59.893 --> 01:02.589
It doesn't matter,
'cause I'm not cleaning up this hallway.

01:02.662 --> 01:04.254
But it's all your bullcrap here...

01:04.330 --> 01:06.855
all them Battlestar Earthblaster
drink cups.

01:06.933 --> 01:09.424
Don't you touch those.
They're in mint condition...

01:09.502 --> 01:10.867
and they're gonna stay that way.

01:10.937 --> 01:12.871
I'll touch them all the way to the trashcan.

01:12.939 --> 01:16.807
You touch those, and your GI Joes
are gonna be MIA, my friend.

01:16.876 --> 01:19.606
And then who's gonna call
little Mama Joe...

01:19.679 --> 01:22.045
and tell her
that her boy ain't coming home...

01:22.115 --> 01:24.709
because somebody was asleep
on guard duty.

01:24.784 --> 01:27.184
What's this? A treasure map.

01:27.253 --> 01:29.016
- Treasure?
- Can I hold it, please?

01:29.089 --> 01:33.025
- There's treasure under all these X's?
- Yeah, obviously.

01:33.093 --> 01:35.755
Amazing.
These are the same exact spots...

01:35.829 --> 01:39.321
where you wanted me to plant
those disgusting azalea bushes.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.300
Are you serious? I guess you better go.

01:42.368 --> 01:45.269
If anyone calls me, I'm gonna be outside...

01:45.672 --> 01:49.164
- with the shovel, sucker.
- No, you don't, that bullion is mine!

01:49.242 --> 01:52.575
Look, don't dig any further
than 12 to 14 inches.

01:52.645 --> 01:53.737
Shut up. You don't know.

01:53.813 --> 01:56.304
You just stay here
and guard my Battlefield Earth cups.

01:56.382 --> 01:58.043
Especially Turtle.

01:58.518 --> 02:01.078
- Look at him. He's dumb as hell.
- He sure is.

02:01.154 --> 02:04.180
I'm dumb, too.
You knew that, though, yeah?

02:04.257 --> 02:06.782
Because I did send out a press release.

02:06.860 --> 02:09.727
I ate a bunch of them. I'm dumb.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.935
No. Milkshake!

02:16.002 --> 02:19.733
I know. The stupid pirates
must have buried a gas line down there.

02:19.806 --> 02:21.865
I told you, 14 inches.

02:21.941 --> 02:25.240
You tell me a lot of things,
but that doesn't mean I have to listen...

02:25.445 --> 02:27.379
Shake, are you all right down there?

02:27.447 --> 02:30.780
Get me out of here right now.
I'm gonna die, there's monsters.

02:30.850 --> 02:31.874
Calm down.

02:31.951 --> 02:34.283
Dracula's grabbing my leg.
It's a zombie. I feel it.

02:34.354 --> 02:36.049
There's no monsters down there, okay?

02:36.122 --> 02:38.590
- You just hit a sinkhole or something.
- Okay.

02:38.658 --> 02:41.650
- Stay right there. I'll get a flashlight.
- I got it.

02:42.462 --> 02:45.090
Holy crap in a pita. Monsters!

02:46.299 --> 02:47.459
<i>Taste.</i>

02:47.867 --> 02:51.268
Who said that? You're all dead.
Nobody can talk if they're dead.

02:51.337 --> 02:55.706
<i>Come to me and taste the future.</i>

02:55.875 --> 02:59.276
Taste what? Hey, free sandwich.

02:59.345 --> 03:02.508
<i>- But beware.
- But you just told me...</i>

03:02.582 --> 03:05.642
<i>Look, I'm 1,000 years old,
I know what I said.</i>

03:05.852 --> 03:08.582
<i>- Beware.
- Yeah, you beware. I'm eating this.</i>

03:10.190 --> 03:13.751
<i>- Where the hell is this?
- You'll know, in time.</i>

03:14.494 --> 03:17.622
The question is, will I care? Probably not.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.730
- Shake?
- Just leave him. He's... Wait a minute.

03:21.801 --> 03:23.564
I smell me some mighty good chow.

03:24.037 --> 03:28.098
- Oh, my God. Shake?
- Oh, my God, Frylock, what?

03:28.408 --> 03:31.377
Why's everything got to be
a federal case with you?

03:31.778 --> 03:35.612
- Yeah, you heard what I said. I said it.
- Where did all these skulls come from?

03:35.682 --> 03:37.912
They're guarding this sandwich.
Now let's go.

03:37.984 --> 03:40.646
Oh, my God. That is no ordinary sandwich.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.587
Oh, my God. Do you ever have
anything good to say?

03:43.656 --> 03:47.285
- It's a free sandwich.
- It's not a sandwich at all, Shake.

03:47.427 --> 03:49.156
It's the Broodwich.

03:52.799 --> 03:56.030
- The blue witch?
- No, the Broodwich, Meatwad.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.700
- Wait. Say what?
- Broodwich!

03:59.772 --> 04:03.538
- The Blair Witch is here?
- No, Meatwad. The Broodwich.

04:03.610 --> 04:06.408
I'll tell you what it is.
It's shut up and let me eat it.

04:06.479 --> 04:09.312
I read a very disturbing article
about this sandwich...

04:09.382 --> 04:10.747
in the Bible.

04:10.817 --> 04:15.117
<i>- No, you probably saw a piece in Vogue.
- I doubt it. I don't read that.</i>

04:15.188 --> 04:19.089
<i>Heidi Klum was on the cover.
You know, the Broodwich issue.</i>

04:19.158 --> 04:20.887
<i>Okay, yes. It was Vogue.</i>

04:20.959 --> 04:24.691
<i>- You read all this in Vogue?
- Our PR department is awesome.</i>

04:24.764 --> 04:28.700
That's a girl magazine.
I hope you were at the dentist's, Frylock.

04:28.768 --> 04:30.429
It just comes to the house, I...

04:30.503 --> 04:34.906
Of course it comes.
When you order it, you big, fat lady.

04:35.475 --> 04:37.102
Someone down there is a girl.

04:37.176 --> 04:39.542
<i>Everyone just shut up
about the Vogue thing!</i>

04:39.612 --> 04:41.341
I'll plant these bushes now.

04:41.414 --> 04:45.510
<i>Listen, according to the Vogue piece,
the Broodwich is immortal.</i>

04:45.585 --> 04:47.519
It cannot be killed or taken apart...

04:47.587 --> 04:50.750
but as long as you don't ingest it,
you'll be okay.

04:50.823 --> 04:52.688
Don't talk while my mouth is full.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.950
How's it going?

04:55.662 --> 04:58.096
Are you the guy
that keeps telling me to beware?

04:58.164 --> 05:00.223
Because I'll tell you where to be.

05:00.667 --> 05:02.862
<i>- Out of my sight.
- Beware.</i>

05:03.836 --> 05:05.997
What do you got? A sound guy or...

05:09.475 --> 05:11.102
That's a good trick.

05:11.177 --> 05:13.111
I'm just gonna go now. Oh, my God.

05:13.179 --> 05:15.306
Get away from me! Leave me!

05:16.516 --> 05:19.007
I'm cool. Yeah, we're all cool here.

05:19.085 --> 05:23.579
<i>- I told you, beware.
- Who are you? What is this?</i>

05:23.656 --> 05:25.681
<i>It is the Broodwich...</i>

05:25.925 --> 05:30.294
<i>forged in darkness from wheat
harvested in hell's half acre...</i>

05:30.430 --> 05:34.264
<i>baked by Beelzebub,
slathered with mayonnaise...</i>

05:34.367 --> 05:38.326
<i>beaten from the evil eggs
of dark chicken forces into sauce...</i>

05:38.404 --> 05:40.929
<i>by the hands of a one-eyed madman...</i>

05:41.074 --> 05:44.601
<i>cheese boiled from the rancid teat
of a fanged cow...</i>

05:44.744 --> 05:49.408
<i>layered with 666 separate meats
from an animal...</i>

05:49.482 --> 05:51.609
<i>which has maggots for blood.</i>

05:52.485 --> 05:55.010
- See? Told you.
- I tasted mustard.

05:55.088 --> 05:57.522
<i>Yeah, Dijon mustard.</i>

05:57.590 --> 06:00.286
<i>- Well, how come no bacon?
- Bacon is extra.</i>

06:00.360 --> 06:02.885
You call this a sandwich?
You don't have bacon on it!

06:02.962 --> 06:06.921
<i>There are no swine evil enough
to sacrifice upon a bed of evil.</i>

06:07.834 --> 06:09.233
<i>And lettuce.</i>

06:10.169 --> 06:12.137
<i>Bed of evil and lettuce.</i>

06:12.205 --> 06:15.106
I will say this. Bacon aside...

06:15.341 --> 06:18.139
this is the best damn sandwich
I've ever had in my life.

06:18.211 --> 06:21.044
<i>Eat all of it, and you will suffer the wrath.</i>

06:21.114 --> 06:24.777
I mean, I don't have to eat
the whole thing. I could save a quarter.

06:25.284 --> 06:26.546
<i>I suppose you could.</i>

06:26.619 --> 06:29.053
'Cause the thing is,
I don't like crust on the bread.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.113
A lot of people do, but not me.

06:31.190 --> 06:34.887
I usually cut it off right at the beginning,
especially if it's hard.

06:34.961 --> 06:37.020
The hard crust hurts the roof of my mouth.

06:37.096 --> 06:38.393
<i>You're boring me now.</i>

06:38.464 --> 06:41.297
Say, since he's the chosen one
and we're not...

06:41.367 --> 06:44.598
could we sort of cover this back up
and plant some azaleas here?

06:44.670 --> 06:45.796
<i>Sure.</i>

06:48.274 --> 06:51.903
- Okay. Come on, Shake. You're gonna die.
- Let go.

06:51.978 --> 06:54.037
Who are y'all talking to down there?

06:54.113 --> 06:57.276
It's a sandwich.
Two pieces of bread and some meat.

06:57.350 --> 06:59.375
And it doesn't even have bacon on it.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.886
I don't need it, I got it licked.

07:04.524 --> 07:07.220
And I would like to lick that sandwich.

07:07.293 --> 07:09.761
Just a little flavor,
a little taste in my mouth.

07:09.829 --> 07:12.992
<i>- What's going on?
- Shake, get rid of the damn sandwich.</i>

07:13.065 --> 07:15.556
If you keep it here,
you're gonna eat it and die.

07:15.635 --> 07:19.162
No, I won't.
I don't need a stupid sandwich.

07:19.238 --> 07:22.366
I don't need the sandwich.
I need this ladder. Excuse me, please.

07:22.442 --> 07:25.377
I need this sandwich right now.
I won't eat the whole thing...

07:26.312 --> 07:27.904
See? Oh, God!

07:28.514 --> 07:32.450
- Okay, look, this is irritating.
- It's the Broodwich. You're chosen.

07:32.518 --> 07:36.921
I haven't paid taxes in six years.
I'm not getting busted by a sandwich.

07:37.089 --> 07:41.685
<i>Then you must find another,
with an appetite for insanity.</i>

07:41.794 --> 07:43.989
Hey, you're dumb. Eat this.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.361
I heard what that voice said.
I ain't eating jack.

07:46.432 --> 07:50.198
You're gonna let this guy scare you?
How bad could it possibly be?

07:50.269 --> 07:53.204
<i>It's a world of skinless,
blood-soaked nightmares...</i>

07:53.272 --> 07:57.299
<i>clattering from the deep
and clattering for the meat of the guilty.</i>

07:57.877 --> 08:02.041
Come on, the guy's just jealous.
Go on. Woof it down, dog.

08:02.114 --> 08:05.106
- I don't know. Is the mayonnaise fat-free?
- You're a dog.

08:05.184 --> 08:08.915
'Cause it's not the calories that get you,
it's the saturated fats.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.218
- Woof it, you mutt.
- Meatwad, no.

08:11.290 --> 08:15.283
Did you hear what I called him?
He can't do jack about it.

08:17.330 --> 08:20.663
How did you like Mr. Sticks?
He was a real treat, wasn't he?

08:20.733 --> 08:23.258
Yeah, Jerry said
you guys had a little run-in...

08:23.336 --> 08:25.861
but he's a decent guy
once you get to know him.

08:25.938 --> 08:30.637
Bullcrap. I know that guy
was all over you with his ax.

08:30.710 --> 08:32.769
No, that don't sound like Jerry.

08:32.845 --> 08:36.110
The Jerry I know
took me to Merry Christmas...

08:37.049 --> 08:40.610
which is a strip club. Merry Triple-Xmas.
You see what I'm saying?

08:40.686 --> 08:42.381
Give me that sandwich!

08:42.455 --> 08:45.720
- So you saying it was fun?
- No. That son of a bitch had an ax.

08:45.825 --> 08:48.521
She's like,
"Move your skulls to the basement...

08:48.594 --> 08:50.221
"because I got these drapes".

08:50.296 --> 08:53.732
- I didn't get that. I'm like, "This is work".
- Are you serious?

08:53.799 --> 08:57.701
I can't put them in the basement, I mean,
and she's like, you know...

08:57.770 --> 08:59.704
"Can you put a tarp over them also?"

08:59.772 --> 09:02.832
And I just felt like, no, I'm not... damn it.

09:02.909 --> 09:05.173
I got one at home just like it, man.

09:05.811 --> 09:10.248
- And I got a kid now, and so...
- That's a whole other set of bull... I'm sure.

09:10.316 --> 09:13.808
So Cathy puts the co-sleeper right next
to my preserved brain collection.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.719
She wants me to move them
'cause she thinks it's not hygienic.

09:16.789 --> 09:19.280
I don't understand
how there's lack of appreciation...

09:19.358 --> 09:23.260
for that backlight coming through the
glass of the jars that the brains are in.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.990
- It looks cool.
- You've seen that?

09:25.064 --> 09:27.965
Why move it? That's the point
of putting it next to the window.

09:28.034 --> 09:31.936
I'm sure you've explained that to Cathy,
but she obviously doesn't get that.

09:32.004 --> 09:34.700
- I can't even argue with her.
- It's ridiculous.

09:34.774 --> 09:36.105
If I want to move it...

09:36.175 --> 09:39.008
- Isn't that that guy?
- What's with the toilet seat, right?

09:39.078 --> 09:41.478
- What the...
- Jerry, no. We're cool.

09:42.448 --> 09:46.248
- We're cool, Jerry.
- Shake, where's the rest of the sandwich?

09:46.319 --> 09:48.947
I guess I ate it. And I'm still here?

09:50.389 --> 09:54.325
<i>- Victory is mine.
- But what about the sun-dried tomatoes?</i>

09:54.894 --> 09:57.385
Yeah, I picked them off
because they're disgusting.

09:57.463 --> 10:00.159
<i>The Broodwich cannot be taken apart
or disassembled.</i>

10:00.232 --> 10:02.928
Obviously it can, because that's what I did.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.732
<i>- You better put them right back.
- Put them back where?</i>

10:05.805 --> 10:08.774
I ate the sandwich. It's gone.

10:10.009 --> 10:11.408
<i>Look. They're good.</i>

10:11.477 --> 10:13.968
Yeah, you keep telling me that.
They're not.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.374
<i>How about you?</i>

10:15.448 --> 10:18.008
- No, thanks.
- No, thank you, I'm full.

10:18.084 --> 10:19.813
<i>Fine, don't eat it!</i>

10:23.055 --> 10:25.819
- Is he gone?
- I don't know, he's a voice.

10:28.561 --> 10:32.156
- Where is he? Is he in them raisins?
- I don't know!

10:33.366 --> 10:35.994
I'm out of here. Worst day of my life.

10:36.769 --> 10:39.294
<i>Congratulations. You passed the test.</i>

10:39.372 --> 10:42.364
<i>You fended off the last temptation
of the Broodwich.</i>

10:42.441 --> 10:44.432
Really? What do I win?

10:44.744 --> 10:48.407
Hell, no, I'm not marrying
this bag of bones.

10:48.714 --> 10:51.274
<i>- Seriously?
- Yes, seriously.</i>

10:52.151 --> 10:54.619
<i>All right. Congratulations.</i>

10:54.687 --> 10:56.814
<i>I know that I said the last one was it...</i>

10:56.889 --> 10:59.551
<i>but that was the last temptation
of the Broodwich.</i>

10:59.625 --> 11:04.062
<i>- You passed again. You're something else.
- Yes, I am. What do I win now?</i>

11:04.130 --> 11:08.760
<i>- Free brain surgery.
- That's what I'm talking about, baby!</i>

11:08.834 --> 11:10.927
<i>- Hey, wait a minute.
- Now eat them.</i>
