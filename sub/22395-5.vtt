00:04.667 --> 00:07.250
Welcome, everyone,
to the hall of science,

00:07.250 --> 00:10.834
home to the greatest
discoveries in scientific history.

00:10.834 --> 00:13.250
Like this one, the shrink ray!

00:13.250 --> 00:16.208
Wow!
A shrink ray!

00:16.208 --> 00:19.000
With that, you could explore inner space.

00:19.000 --> 00:21.625
Just think of the amazing
things you could discover.

00:21.625 --> 00:23.291
Yeah! What?

00:23.291 --> 00:24.417
Hey, Donald!

00:24.417 --> 00:27.208
Isn't this incredibly interesting?

00:27.208 --> 00:28.041
No.

00:31.709 --> 00:34.041
Imagine being inside a snow flake,

00:34.041 --> 00:36.166
seeing an endless world of atoms.

00:36.166 --> 00:38.792
Witnessing the miracle of molecules!

00:39.542 --> 00:41.000
Or swimming in a cup!

00:41.000 --> 00:43.834
Goofy! The shrink ray,
it really worked!

00:43.834 --> 00:45.125
Wow!

00:45.125 --> 00:48.583
Hey, Donald! Down here!
Look at us! It worked.

00:50.041 --> 00:52.208
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

00:54.166 --> 00:55.250
Wow!

00:57.041 --> 00:58.792
This is it, goofy!

00:58.792 --> 01:02.959
Our very own chance to make
the scientific discovery of a lifetime!

01:03.291 --> 01:05.125
Well, what are we waitin' for?

01:06.875 --> 01:09.166
Look! Vocal chords.

01:18.250 --> 01:20.709
<i>â™ª Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

01:25.166 --> 01:26.458
Funny bone!

01:26.458 --> 01:27.542
Tickle, tickle.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.709
Koo-chi-koo-chi-koo!

01:35.417 --> 01:37.834
What's happening?

01:40.125 --> 01:42.542
We've discovered the lungs!

01:52.041 --> 01:53.709
Now where are we?

01:53.709 --> 01:56.750
We're in Donald's cranial cavity!

02:01.750 --> 02:04.000
What the...
You guys?

02:04.000 --> 02:08.125
Donald! You wouldn't believe the
amazing discoveries we've made in here!

02:08.125 --> 02:10.375
So, you're the cause of this!

02:10.375 --> 02:12.417
Now, Donald, no need to get angry.

02:18.000 --> 02:20.291
Oh, no!
Brain storm!

02:20.625 --> 02:22.291
Goofy, quick.
In there!

02:32.417 --> 02:35.583
You think you can hide
in there? I'll show you!

02:37.959 --> 02:39.417
Incoming!

02:43.834 --> 02:45.542
Burp bombs!

02:45.542 --> 02:47.166
Goofy, dive!

02:53.291 --> 02:57.709
Whew. Right about now, all I
want to discover is a way out of here.

02:58.709 --> 03:00.250
That ain't right.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.500
Huh?

03:01.500 --> 03:03.458
Whoa! I think the
shrink ray is wearing off.

03:13.417 --> 03:15.250
Whoo-hoo!

03:15.250 --> 03:21.500
Astounding! Men from egg? What an
astonishing scientific discovery we got!

03:21.500 --> 03:25.000
I'd say this warrants
further exploration.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.375
Oh, no, it doesn't!
