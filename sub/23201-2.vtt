00:08.467 --> 00:10.218
<i>Previously on You, Me, Her...</i>

00:10.260 --> 00:12.513
: How often are you having sex?

00:12.554 --> 00:13.597
: If I stuck my tongue in Emma's mouth,

00:13.639 --> 00:15.850
she'd probably just crack up laughing.

00:15.891 --> 00:17.267
You do it with someone you don't know.

00:17.309 --> 00:19.728
Someone who doesn't laugh when you get your sexy on.

00:19.770 --> 00:20.896
I'm talking about an escort.

00:20.938 --> 00:22.481
: One more week.

00:22.523 --> 00:23.565
There's my little hooker.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.192
: We're escorts. It's different.

00:25.233 --> 00:26.193
I love you, weirdo.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.235
Fuck.

00:28.487 --> 00:30.113
Jesus, I can't do this. What's wrong with me?

00:30.155 --> 00:31.114
I came clean.

00:31.156 --> 00:32.574
Don't I get points for coming clean?

00:34.618 --> 00:35.577
I want to see her.

00:35.619 --> 00:36.620
Wow, you are really pretty.

00:38.413 --> 00:39.373
Surprise.

00:39.414 --> 00:40.875
: The reason why I hired you

00:40.916 --> 00:42.417
is to save my marriage, actually.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.754
And I probably should have told you this

00:45.796 --> 00:46.964
a long, long time ago,

00:47.006 --> 00:49.257
but, um...

00:49.299 --> 00:51.134
she wasn't my first girl.

01:07.568 --> 01:08.569
Hey.

01:11.030 --> 01:13.741
So, in the half hour or so that I actually slept,

01:13.782 --> 01:15.868
I had the weirdest dream.

01:15.910 --> 01:16.994
We did it on the kitchen floor...

01:17.036 --> 01:19.914
Wow.

01:19.955 --> 01:20.915
Yeah.

01:20.956 --> 01:22.541
And then you told me

01:22.583 --> 01:24.543
you got a foot job under the table

01:24.585 --> 01:26.795
from a girl.

01:26.837 --> 01:30.173
That's so much like my dream,

01:30.215 --> 01:33.635
except before that girl gave me a foot job under the table,

01:33.677 --> 01:35.136
you made out with her in a hotel room.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.265
What if it really happened?

01:38.306 --> 01:40.601
How crazy would that be?

01:40.642 --> 01:41.936
So crazy.

01:42.937 --> 01:45.814
So what now?

01:45.856 --> 01:47.858
Well, it's early.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.238
-Oh... Oh, God. -Yeah.

01:53.280 --> 01:54.782
Yeah.

01:54.823 --> 01:56.742
There's a reason why that only happens in movies.

01:56.784 --> 01:57.993
Call the CDC.

01:58.035 --> 01:59.536
I think we just created a plague.

01:59.578 --> 02:00.704
-Should we-- -Yeah.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.179
You're disgusting.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.057
You make me sick.

02:30.692 --> 02:33.070
Go. Run. Save yourself.

02:33.112 --> 02:35.864
At least one of your organs is in there.

02:35.906 --> 02:36.865
So gross.

02:36.907 --> 02:39.200
Okay, then.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.414
Today is the first day of your life, Isabelle Marie Silva.

02:44.456 --> 02:45.624
You are stripped bare,

02:45.666 --> 02:46.875
born anew,

02:46.917 --> 02:48.961
and now you must wash all the sins of--

02:51.421 --> 02:53.882
Oh, fuck.

02:53.924 --> 02:55.467
Andy.

02:55.509 --> 02:57.469
Or you could just stop being a selfish cunt.

02:57.511 --> 02:59.346
Could you

03:00.973 --> 03:04.392
So, can we talk

03:04.434 --> 03:07.312
about this whole girl-girl-girl...

03:07.354 --> 03:08.438
phase,

03:08.480 --> 03:09.982
whatever it was?

03:10.024 --> 03:11.025
Like...

03:11.066 --> 03:12.818
why didn't you tell me about this?

03:14.653 --> 03:15.612
Um...

03:15.654 --> 03:18.197
Something we should have...

03:18.239 --> 03:20.617
I'm sorry. I should have.

03:20.659 --> 03:22.119
Maybe I should see

03:22.161 --> 03:24.163
if Dina has a cancellation later today or something?

03:24.203 --> 03:25.873
Does it bother you?

03:25.914 --> 03:27.041
It's-- I think--

03:27.082 --> 03:28.375
we should talk about it at least.

03:28.416 --> 03:29.376
Okay. Yeah.

03:29.417 --> 03:31.753
Just to wrap our heads around it

03:31.795 --> 03:33.964
in the company of a professional?

03:34.006 --> 03:35.090
Yeah.

03:35.132 --> 03:36.091
That is a good idea.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.134
Good, right?

03:37.176 --> 03:38.135
You're full of good ideas.

03:44.183 --> 03:45.559
: So, it's me again,

03:45.600 --> 03:47.936
the loathsome, sociopathic no

03:47.978 --> 03:49.437
This is try number seven, Andrew,

03:49.479 --> 03:52.649
which legally constitutes cellular groveling.

03:52.691 --> 03:54.026
So, call now

03:54.068 --> 03:56.486
and receive one sexual favor in a semi-public place--

03:56.528 --> 03:58.989
Sorry, that was-- that was weird.

03:59.031 --> 04:02.117
Um, just call me back, okay?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.618
I miss you.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.164
What is that?

04:10.333 --> 04:11.418
Hello.

04:12.586 --> 04:13.545
Whatcha doing?

04:13.587 --> 04:14.922
Don't distract me.

04:14.963 --> 04:16.757
I'm trying to, like, black out the last 60 seconds

04:16.798 --> 04:19.218
so that we can keep living together.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
Just, by the way,

04:21.302 --> 04:22.596
it's painfully transparent

04:22.637 --> 04:23.430
that you're only into Andy when he cuts you off.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.306
I'm just saying.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.601
What?

04:27.642 --> 04:28.977
Where are the dolls?

04:29.019 --> 04:30.520
You know what this is?

04:30.562 --> 04:32.355
You're, like, deep into

04:32.397 --> 04:34.191
another of your spastic,

04:34.233 --> 04:37.652
reactionary self

04:37.694 --> 04:39.238
No, Nina.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.032
I'm getting my shit together.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.701
People do it all the time.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.161
No, you--

04:46.203 --> 04:47.579
You do it all the time, Iz.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.539
You ever consider just, like, keeping it together,

04:49.581 --> 04:51.750
relatively speaking?

04:51.792 --> 04:53.252
Or do you secretly dig

04:53.293 --> 04:54.294
this whole death and resurrection cycle

04:54.335 --> 04:55.754
that you're trapped in?

04:55.796 --> 04:56.880
Ahem.

04:56.922 --> 04:58.339
I do have a question for you, though?

04:58.381 --> 04:59.340
Okay. Yeah. What the fuck is that?

05:00.383 --> 05:01.593
How many times have I told you

05:01.635 --> 05:03.095
to not leave your nail polish up here?

05:03.137 --> 05:04.512
I didn't leave my nail polish up there.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.098
Every time. Does it

05:16.691 --> 05:20.904
I don't care about your personal problems,

05:20.946 --> 05:23.531
Piper or Meghan, or whoever you are.

05:23.573 --> 05:25.408
Come in, please.

05:27.327 --> 05:28.787
: Fred

05:28.829 --> 05:30.956
Izzy?

05:32.666 --> 05:33.750
Remember that?

06:04.990 --> 06:06.950
So, here's the thing...

06:08.451 --> 06:11.496
I've been a very, very bad girl, Jack,

06:11.538 --> 06:15.667
and I need some firm counseling.

06:16.710 --> 06:17.711
Think you can do that?

06:38.565 --> 06:39.900
Jack, Jack, Jack.

06:39.941 --> 06:40.901
You know, you can schedule

06:40.942 --> 06:42.236
an emergency therapy session,

06:42.277 --> 06:43.320
lock the doors,

06:43.362 --> 06:44.445
build a moat,

06:44.487 --> 06:45.697
put some sharks in it,

06:45.739 --> 06:48.158
but there's just one little problem...

06:53.663 --> 06:54.664
I'm already inside.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.171
Surprise.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.717
Can you be cool?

07:05.759 --> 07:08.220
I think so.

07:41.169 --> 07:42.421
Ahem. Ahem.

07:42.462 --> 07:43.504
Oh, my God!

07:43.546 --> 07:44.714
Um...

07:44.756 --> 07:45.882
Jack?

07:46.925 --> 07:47.926
Jack?

07:51.054 --> 07:52.013
Dean Weinstock.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.056
Might I have a word? You may.

07:54.141 --> 07:55.934
May I suggest "capricious"?

07:55.976 --> 07:57.644
That's a favorite.

07:57.685 --> 07:59.438
Um, so is that my lamp,

07:59.479 --> 08:01.522
or are you just happy to see me?

08:01.564 --> 08:03.191
Wow. Why would I say that?

08:03.233 --> 08:05.193
I sound like I'm offering you sexual favors,

08:05.235 --> 08:06.694
which...

08:06.736 --> 08:07.862
which I guarantee you I'm not.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.991
Are you somebody's son?

08:11.032 --> 08:11.992
I mean, like,

08:12.033 --> 08:13.452
everybody's somebody's son,

08:13.493 --> 08:15.745
but are you, like, somebody's son,

08:15.787 --> 08:16.997
like a big client or something?

08:17.038 --> 08:18.748
Please tell me you're not.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.792
I'm going to write you a really good recommendation

08:20.834 --> 08:22.127
when you go back to school.

08:22.169 --> 08:24.963
Oh, don't bother clearing that browsing history.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.341
Your porn's already been logged and ostracized.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.010
I don't-- porn on this--

08:30.051 --> 08:31.428
on the computers, no.

08:31.470 --> 08:32.429
That's not my--

08:32.471 --> 08:33.888
I'm joking.

08:33.930 --> 08:35.265
Okay.

08:35.307 --> 08:36.641
Funny.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.310
However, there is something we need to talk about.

08:44.316 --> 08:46.609
: Whatever you feel matters only to you.

08:46.651 --> 08:50.489
Whatever you do about it matters to the world.

08:50.530 --> 08:53.283
Your life and your relationships

08:53.325 --> 08:55.535
are a sum of your choices and actions.

08:56.995 --> 08:58.372
Meatloaf is just an excuse

08:58.413 --> 09:00.332
to serve a giant bunless hamburger.

09:07.506 --> 09:10.550
Andy! Hi. Hi. You called.

09:10.591 --> 09:11.968
Um, choose your favorite greeting.

09:12.010 --> 09:12.969
One...

09:13.011 --> 09:16.014
I am a nice guy, Iz,

09:16.056 --> 09:19.600
<i>but don't mistake that</i> <i>for me being a pushover.</i>

09:19.642 --> 09:22.270
How about we just move on to something healthier?

09:24.731 --> 09:26.149
Please?

09:27.650 --> 09:28.609
Okay.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.070
<i>All right, all right.</i>

09:34.074 --> 09:35.700
You know what, it worked.

09:35.742 --> 09:36.868
I can't believe I'm saying this,

09:36.910 --> 09:39.620
but your stupid moron plan actually worked.

09:39.662 --> 09:41.248
Em and I are having crazy sex.

09:41.289 --> 09:43.124
We mopped the kitchen floor with each other last night.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.292
Mm-hmm.

09:44.334 --> 09:45.502
Like, real sex.

09:45.544 --> 09:47.421
We were engaged and looking at each other--

09:47.462 --> 09:48.588
and making out.

09:48.629 --> 09:49.839
We haven't made out in years.

09:49.881 --> 09:51.049
I think we're going to do it tonight, too.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.634
You're welcome.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.928
My work here is done.

09:54.969 --> 09:56.971
Why am I still fantasizing about Izzy, though,

09:57.013 --> 09:58.139
instead of Emma?

09:58.181 --> 10:00.308
Dude, honestly,

10:00.350 --> 10:03.395
does anybody fantasize about their wife?

10:03.437 --> 10:04.729
I mean, I own

10:04.771 --> 10:07.399
an obscenely expensive black sports car

10:07.441 --> 10:09.401
that does 0 to 140 in, like, six seconds.

10:09.443 --> 10:10.902
Do you think I fantasize

10:10.944 --> 10:12.112
about driving

10:12.153 --> 10:13.488
an obscenely expensive black sports car

10:13.530 --> 10:15.365
that does 0 to 140 in six seconds?

10:15.407 --> 10:17.117
: That makes no sense whatsoever.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.411
I'll get the Meaty Jackson 3

10:19.453 --> 10:20.787
and he'll have The Hot Angie.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.872
: Thank you.

10:22.914 --> 10:24.082
So, just to be clear,

10:24.124 --> 10:27.294
my wife is the car in your metaphor?

10:27.335 --> 10:28.420
-Yeah. Yeah. -I don't get it.

10:28.462 --> 10:30.088
A very sexy car.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.423
If there was a reasonable method,

10:31.465 --> 10:33.633
I'd totally fuck my car.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.053
Why do I come--

10:37.095 --> 10:38.388
What

10:39.431 --> 10:40.723
What is your problem?

10:40.765 --> 10:42.016
There's a million people I could come to advice for,

10:42.058 --> 10:42.809
I come to you. I have a lot of my plate right now.

10:42.850 --> 10:43.977
I have--

10:44.018 --> 10:45.686
Weinstock is retiring as dean

10:45.728 --> 10:47.855
and he's recommending me as his replacement.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.357
I know.

10:49.399 --> 10:52.193
So... so, in addition

10:52.235 --> 10:54.362
to you being unable to avoid getting laid,

10:54.404 --> 10:56.156
even in your sleep,

10:56.197 --> 10:58.074
you're gonna be the dean

10:58.116 --> 11:00.410
of one of the top private high schools

11:00.452 --> 11:01.744
on the West Coast?

11:01.786 --> 11:03.663
I walked right into that one.

11:03.704 --> 11:04.831
Yeah. God!

11:06.040 --> 11:07.292
-Gotta get the food here. -Get the food.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.669
It's the least you can do after I pay for it.

11:10.837 --> 11:11.963
Thank you.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.968
Here's the thing, man, with Izzy,

11:17.010 --> 11:18.261
we didn't just make out.

11:18.303 --> 11:20.013
We went much further than that.

11:20.054 --> 11:22.474
What kind of guy does something like that?

11:22.516 --> 11:25.519
A guy with a dick?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.103
The other problem I have is

11:27.145 --> 11:29.022
Weinstock said that they monitor

11:29.063 --> 11:30.815
our Internet use at the office,

11:30.857 --> 11:32.775
and I used the office computer to contact Izzy.

11:32.817 --> 11:34.110
You what?

11:34.152 --> 11:35.945
Ow! Come on, man. Stop fucking smacking me.

11:35.987 --> 11:37.030
Stop being such a dumbass!

11:38.406 --> 11:39.366
We are adults.

11:39.407 --> 11:41.868
Get your hands off my suit!

11:43.495 --> 11:44.454
-Yeah.

11:44.496 --> 11:45.955
What was that?

11:47.415 --> 11:49.750
Sorry, sorry. He's my brother. I apologize.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.587
Listen, you better run.

11:58.385 --> 11:59.886
: Stay with it.

11:59.927 --> 12:02.930
Say no to your brain's defense mechanism

12:02.972 --> 12:05.600
of retreat and surrender.

12:05.642 --> 12:09.270
Say yes to your will, your intentions.

12:09.312 --> 12:11.898
You're not going to have an orgasm, are you?

12:12.982 --> 12:14.192
Mm. No promises.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.571
I'm having some kind of mind-body renaissance.

12:17.612 --> 12:18.572
: Stay present.

12:18.613 --> 12:21.700
Be with your body.

12:21.740 --> 12:23.535
Trust your body.

12:23.577 --> 12:26.287
Be thankful for all that she does for you.

12:26.329 --> 12:28.998
Hear her.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.334
I can hear this one Kegel-ing from over here.

12:31.376 --> 12:32.377
Shut up!

12:33.712 --> 12:36.964
: Oh, wow, Emma, just beautiful.

12:37.006 --> 12:38.717
You're glowing.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.843
Everyone, if you can manage to look over here at Emma,

12:40.885 --> 12:45.265
this is what it looks like to trust your body.

12:45.306 --> 12:46.307
You inspire me, Emma.

12:49.227 --> 12:51.271
I have a great teacher.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.064
Namaste.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.194
: And into downward dog.

13:05.034 --> 13:08.829
Got a little something on your nose, there, Moonbeam.

13:08.871 --> 13:10.498
Jealous much?

13:10.540 --> 13:12.083
I'm simply accustomed

13:12.125 --> 13:13.418
to being better than you at everything,

13:13.460 --> 13:15.002
especially yoga.

13:15.044 --> 13:17.672
You are not better than me at everything.

13:17.714 --> 13:19.466
I'm waiting.

13:19.507 --> 13:22.343
I'm better than you at hooking up with girls.

13:24.387 --> 13:25.764
Are we talking about

13:25.804 --> 13:28.224
the hideously deformed grad student?

13:28.266 --> 13:29.934
We are.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.353
We made out in the bathroom.

13:32.395 --> 13:33.980
After she gave me a foot job under the table.

13:35.814 --> 13:37.484
I can't stop thinking about it.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.278
Oh.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.821
What's wrong?

13:42.863 --> 13:44.282
Just...

13:44.324 --> 13:46.200
If you're back into chicks, why not me, you big lesbo?

13:46.242 --> 13:48.662
I mean, I'd refuse you, of course, but...

13:48.703 --> 13:50.288
Okay, first of all, I am not a "big lesbo,"

13:50.330 --> 13:52.039
which is offensive, by the way.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.583
And second...

13:53.625 --> 13:56.210
I don't even know if I'm "back into chicks."

13:56.252 --> 13:57.253
Double air quotes. Mine.

13:59.213 --> 14:01.257
So did she initiate?

14:01.299 --> 14:04.761
Were you, like, a passive participant or--

14:04.803 --> 14:08.139
I was no lady in the ladies room.

14:08.181 --> 14:09.432
What does that mean?

14:09.474 --> 14:10.433
How far did you go?

14:10.475 --> 14:12.811
Were you guys, like, eating at the Y?

14:12.851 --> 14:13.936
Ew. I don't even know what that means.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.106
Have you told Jack?

14:17.148 --> 14:19.025
Yeah.

14:21.194 --> 14:22.654
I kind of feel like

14:22.696 --> 14:25.824
I'm dangling my marriage out a 10-story window right now.

14:27.241 --> 14:28.201
But at the same time,

14:28.242 --> 14:30.662
I'm into him more than ever.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.455
You know, I want him again.

14:32.497 --> 14:35.166
Does that make sense?

14:37.126 --> 14:38.586
People jump out of perfectly good airplanes

14:38.628 --> 14:40.505
for a reason, babydoll.

14:42.507 --> 14:43.883
Maybe.

14:45.343 --> 14:48.262
Are you and Carmen having your post

14:48.304 --> 14:49.263
A little Pinot?

14:49.305 --> 14:50.557
She took mine

14:50.598 --> 14:52.559
when I air quoted twice in the same sentence.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.101
Okay, good,

14:54.143 --> 14:56.688
because I just booked a time with Dina in about 30 minutes.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.772
I'll meet you there.

14:57.814 --> 14:58.939
I'm gonna get there early,

14:58.981 --> 14:59.940
and just kind of establish my position

14:59.982 --> 15:00.941
as the good guy in this situation.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.736
A, our shrink is a chick,

15:02.777 --> 15:03.944
B, you started the whole thing

15:03.986 --> 15:05.112
by calling a hooker,

15:05.154 --> 15:06.740
so C, you are screwed.

15:06.781 --> 15:07.741
<i>Wait, did you just say</i>

15:07.782 --> 15:08.991
all this in front of Carmen?

15:09.033 --> 15:10.451
No. No, of course not.

15:10.493 --> 15:11.452
She's, uh...

15:11.494 --> 15:12.704
she's pooping.

15:14.080 --> 15:16.249
<i>I'm sure she'll be thrilled</i>

15:16.290 --> 15:17.709
you're outing her pooping habits.

15:17.751 --> 15:18.959
Yeah.

15:19.001 --> 15:20.211
It's... it's a yoga thing.

15:20.253 --> 15:23.089
You know, run to the bathroom,

15:23.130 --> 15:24.382
occasional fight over a stall.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.259
You know, yoga.

15:26.300 --> 15:28.094
<i>Okay. I love you.</i> <i>See you there.</i>

15:28.135 --> 15:30.179
Love you, Babe. Bye.

15:30.221 --> 15:31.264
I'm sorry.

15:31.305 --> 15:34.601
Anything but poo. Anything but poo.

15:34.642 --> 15:36.603
You know what, just next time, tell him I died.

15:44.360 --> 15:45.361
There you are.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.372
Okay.

15:57.540 --> 15:58.499
I'm trying really hard

15:58.541 --> 16:00.877
to be... patiently submissive here,

16:00.919 --> 16:03.713
but this steely silence thing

16:03.755 --> 16:04.881
is... is...

16:04.923 --> 16:07.216
just about to cross the line

16:07.258 --> 16:09.260
between self-empowerment and douchebaggery.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.429
I think you might be my penance.

16:11.471 --> 16:13.973
For the evil man

16:14.014 --> 16:14.974
You gotta see it

16:15.015 --> 16:17.477
through now, right?

16:17.518 --> 16:19.896
Suffer. Be cleansed.

16:19.938 --> 16:22.982
I'm all done suffering, Iz.

16:23.023 --> 16:25.192
I know.

16:25.234 --> 16:26.945
Yeah, you do?

16:26.986 --> 16:28.822
I do. Yes.

16:28.863 --> 16:30.197
Good,

16:30.239 --> 16:34.953
'cause you are going to take me on a proper date.

16:34.994 --> 16:36.955
Is that right?

16:36.996 --> 16:40.040
You are going to court me first.

16:40.082 --> 16:41.375
Okay.

16:41.417 --> 16:42.919
Then you're going to woo me...

16:42.961 --> 16:44.128
Uh-huh.

16:44.170 --> 16:46.172
And wine and dine me.

16:47.340 --> 16:48.967
Any chance I'm gonna get some?

16:49.008 --> 16:52.136
I'm a sure thing. Yeah. Complete slut.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.429
Sold.

16:53.471 --> 16:54.889
So when's the big date?

16:54.931 --> 16:56.557
Right now. No possibility of flaking

16:58.267 --> 16:59.894
or turning it into some sloppy booty call.

16:59.936 --> 17:00.895
Let's just go.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.564
Okay, just back it up.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.315
What?

17:04.357 --> 17:05.608
Recall, if you will,

17:05.650 --> 17:07.443
literally counting down from 60 on your phone?

17:07.485 --> 17:09.362
You know when I get the O.C.

17:09.403 --> 17:10.446
I was cleaning,

17:10.488 --> 17:12.198
shit was crazy at the house.

17:12.239 --> 17:13.407
Like, I'm sweating.

17:13.449 --> 17:16.369
Like, I'm... I'm not-- I'm vile right now.

17:16.410 --> 17:18.371
You really need to give me a minute.

17:18.412 --> 17:19.413
Suffer. Be cleansed.

17:20.707 --> 17:24.919
Why don't we... just meet here in an hour?

17:24.961 --> 17:25.920
Okay?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.798
I wanna be pretty for you.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.061
Um... you're cheating.

17:42.102 --> 17:43.062
What?

17:43.103 --> 17:44.939
No.

17:44.981 --> 17:48.526
Am I ever going to have any control in this thing?

17:48.568 --> 17:50.987
How honest do you want me to be?

17:55.742 --> 17:58.202
It was the summer of my junior year,

17:58.244 --> 18:01.121
and Barcelona was crawling with students.

18:01.163 --> 18:02.456
I...

18:02.498 --> 18:03.666
I was in this bar,

18:03.708 --> 18:04.959
and this girl comes in,

18:05.001 --> 18:06.711
and she was with this really good-looking dude,

18:06.753 --> 18:07.754
so I thought it was her boyfriend.

18:07.795 --> 18:08.922
Turns out he was her gay best friend.

18:08.963 --> 18:11.340
And...

18:11.382 --> 18:13.051
He dared us to make out.

18:13.092 --> 18:14.052
He took up a collection.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.178
Oh, God, this is...

18:16.220 --> 18:18.848
Well, Dina said we could unlock the memories.

18:18.890 --> 18:20.767
: It's unhealthy to deny the past,

18:20.808 --> 18:21.976
especially from our partners.

18:22.018 --> 18:22.977
It's who we are.

18:23.019 --> 18:25.396
Awesome. Yeah. Keep going, honey.

18:25.438 --> 18:28.566
It turns out Evangeline had, um... put him up to it.

18:28.608 --> 18:31.611
Please. I'm sorry, Dina.

18:31.652 --> 18:32.779
Evangeline?

18:32.820 --> 18:34.113
No one's really called Evangeline.

18:34.154 --> 18:35.782
At first, we would just

18:35.823 --> 18:37.658
steal kisses in alleys...

18:39.159 --> 18:42.038
Then we would walk through town, holding hands...

18:42.080 --> 18:44.040
It's embarrassing how cool I thought I was.

18:44.082 --> 18:45.750
I'm currently embarrassed for you,

18:45.792 --> 18:47.794
your telling this story.

18:49.837 --> 18:53.049
You know, I think I was in love with her.

18:53.091 --> 18:54.675
Yeah.

18:54.717 --> 18:55.676
I was in love with--

18:55.718 --> 18:57.971
I almost fucked Izzy.

19:02.182 --> 19:04.102
Yeah. As long as we're unlocking secrets.

19:04.143 --> 19:05.686
I almost fucked Izzy.

19:05.728 --> 19:07.605
We were right on the border, man.

19:07.647 --> 19:09.315
It was like on the razor's edge.

19:09.356 --> 19:10.441
Oh, well, you know,

19:10.483 --> 19:11.442
if you have unfinished business,

19:11.484 --> 19:12.735
by all means, be my guest.

19:12.777 --> 19:13.736
Well, excuse me,

19:13.778 --> 19:15.071
I'm the one sitting here,

19:15.113 --> 19:16.948
listening to your dreamy lesbian nostalgia-gasm.

19:16.990 --> 19:18.532
: Okay, you guys, let's not--

19:18.574 --> 19:21.035
Back up, Dina, okay? This is our moment.

19:21.077 --> 19:22.703
: It's your obscenely expensive session,

19:22.745 --> 19:23.704
so have at it.

19:23.746 --> 19:26.124
Okay, since it is our session,

19:26.165 --> 19:27.750
can I talk about this fucking music, okay?

19:27.792 --> 19:29.251
This elevator music from hell.

19:29.293 --> 19:30.586
Is this music?

19:30.628 --> 19:32.546
I mean, it feels like--

19:32.588 --> 19:34.590
If it is, please turn it up so I can recognize it as music,

19:34.632 --> 19:35.716
otherwise turn it the fuck down,

19:35.758 --> 19:36.968
'cause I want to skull-fuck someone

19:37.010 --> 19:37.969
with this Guantanamo Bay shit!

19:38.011 --> 19:39.762
The music is really annoying.

19:41.472 --> 19:42.431
Please.

19:42.473 --> 19:43.724
: That's so sweet.

19:43.766 --> 19:46.268
The enemy of my enemy.

19:46.310 --> 19:48.604
Okay, to both of you...

19:48.646 --> 19:50.982
how did it end with these respective lovers?

19:51.024 --> 19:52.483
Evangeline and Izzy?

19:54.234 --> 19:55.194
Um...

19:55.235 --> 19:57.196
You want to go first?

19:58.364 --> 19:59.991
Finish your story?

20:00.033 --> 20:01.617
: Now, hold on just a second.

20:01.659 --> 20:03.202
Where is that remote?

20:03.243 --> 20:05.079
This just got interesting.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.136
Ugh...

20:20.178 --> 20:21.470
Hey.

20:21.512 --> 20:22.555
Hey, you.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.681
You were just really throwing it back.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.058
It's just a reasonable,

20:25.099 --> 20:28.811
moderate dose of, you know, liquid courage, I guess.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.438
You look gorgeous. You're such a nice guy.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.319
My balls just ran away from my body.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.864
No, no, no, no. I don't mean it like that!

20:39.906 --> 20:42.366
I mean, like, you're The Premium Package.

20:42.408 --> 20:44.618
You're, like, hot enough to be a dick and get away with it,

20:44.660 --> 20:45.661
but you're not.

20:47.538 --> 20:48.497
Okay, well,

20:48.539 --> 20:51.500
would it be better if I was a dick?

20:51.542 --> 20:53.293
If I made this, like, way harder?

20:53.335 --> 20:55.213
Hey, what if I was a married dick?

20:56.214 --> 20:58.049
Girls like you, you dig that kind of stuff, right?

20:58.091 --> 21:00.300
Girls like me?

21:00.342 --> 21:03.012
Oh, don't pretend to be the wounded one, okay?

21:03.054 --> 21:04.471
I couldn't even get you to be here

21:04.513 --> 21:05.472
until I shut you down.

21:05.514 --> 21:08.601
Shit.

21:08.642 --> 21:09.602
I guess...

21:09.643 --> 21:10.811
You do know women.

21:10.853 --> 21:14.148
I was raised by a mother and two big sisters.

21:14.190 --> 21:15.357
Might explain

21:15.399 --> 21:17.151
my debilitating emotional availability.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.694
Yeah, you are pretty fucked up.

21:18.736 --> 21:20.154
Ahem.

21:22.115 --> 21:23.866
Iz, I'm not gonna bullshit you, okay?

21:23.908 --> 21:26.994
This "date" of ours...

21:29.705 --> 21:31.290
This has to be the beginning of us,

21:31.331 --> 21:34.334
like, as a couple, okay?

21:34.376 --> 21:36.212
For full disclosure's sake,

21:36.254 --> 21:40.716
I very much want it to end with relatively sober-ish sex.

21:42.051 --> 21:44.762
Like, romantic sex, you know?

21:44.804 --> 21:47.723
I want to wake up in the morning with you,

21:47.765 --> 21:48.891
have you still be there.

21:48.933 --> 21:49.892
I want to make you breakfast.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.310
I want...

21:51.351 --> 21:53.062
I want to know the real thing with you.

21:53.104 --> 21:55.439
If that's not what you had in mind,

21:55.481 --> 21:56.440
and, you know, you're just

21:56.482 --> 21:57.441
luring me back in

21:57.483 --> 21:59.693
to prove that you can or whatever,

21:59.735 --> 22:02.947
let's just end it right here and now.

22:02.989 --> 22:04.657
Wow. Okay.

22:04.698 --> 22:06.533
That's, uh--

22:06.575 --> 22:08.202
I mean, I've let this go on for a really long time, right?

22:08.244 --> 22:11.455
Like, I'm sure we could both agree on that.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.334
Moment of truth, Iz--

22:15.375 --> 22:18.378
Like, you're all in, or I'm out.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.350
Is that a good sigh or a bad sigh?

22:34.854 --> 22:36.438
I love you so fucking much.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.110
I love you.

22:42.569 --> 22:43.779
You know that, right?

22:45.698 --> 22:46.907
Like a rock.

22:46.949 --> 22:48.701
Like a rock?

22:50.161 --> 22:52.163
It's, like, a '70s song.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.041
Don't cry.

22:55.082 --> 22:56.750
Please don't cry. I'm not mad.

22:58.169 --> 23:00.087
I'm not crying.

23:01.755 --> 23:03.841
So how did it end?

23:03.883 --> 23:05.301
I just want to know how it ended, you know?

23:05.343 --> 23:07.261
I think...

23:07.303 --> 23:09.555
this whole thing with this...

23:09.596 --> 23:11.849
this girl...

23:11.891 --> 23:13.559
that told you her name was Evangeline...

23:13.600 --> 23:15.477
I wasn't fooled.

23:15.519 --> 23:17.771
It was part of the game.

23:17.813 --> 23:19.148
I told her my name was Lyric.

23:19.190 --> 23:20.274
You did not?

23:20.316 --> 23:21.567
I did.

23:21.608 --> 23:22.860
She bought that?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.320
Yeah.

23:25.905 --> 23:28.157
And then you just never tried to contact her?

23:29.575 --> 23:30.534
I don't know.

23:30.576 --> 23:32.786
Summer ended. I went home.

23:32.828 --> 23:36.040
I just went back to being me, Emma.

23:37.457 --> 23:38.625
And then there was Girl Number Two?

23:38.667 --> 23:40.669
Mm-hmm.

23:45.216 --> 23:46.175
And another.

23:46.217 --> 23:47.718
There's other girls?

23:47.760 --> 23:49.303
How many girls are we talking about?

23:49.345 --> 23:50.721
That was it.

23:50.763 --> 23:51.847
I swear.

23:51.889 --> 23:54.267
It wasn't like that. It wasn't--

23:54.308 --> 23:56.394
It wasn't a thing.

23:56.434 --> 23:57.435
It's totally a fucking thing.

23:57.477 --> 23:58.645
How can you say that?

23:58.687 --> 23:59.646
I mean, this is--

23:59.688 --> 24:01.232
It just never came up.

24:01.274 --> 24:03.067
What is

24:04.402 --> 24:06.028
Well, how did you end it?

24:06.070 --> 24:07.445
With who?

24:07.487 --> 24:08.739
With who? With Izzy.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.324
Izzy's an escort.

24:10.366 --> 24:13.451
You don't have to end things. You just don't call them again.

24:15.955 --> 24:17.539
You've had no contact with her since the hotel?

24:17.581 --> 24:18.999
Like, at all?

24:19.041 --> 24:20.293
Why are you saying it like that?

24:20.334 --> 24:21.585
'Cause I'm asking you,

24:21.627 --> 24:23.170
have you or have you not had contact with her?

24:24.880 --> 24:25.923
I...

24:26.924 --> 24:27.883
I saw her once.

24:27.925 --> 24:29.051
I saw her outside.

24:29.093 --> 24:30.261
I just wanted to tell her

24:30.303 --> 24:31.262
that I couldn't see her ever again,

24:31.304 --> 24:32.263
and that it was over, and goodbye.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.348
I just wanted to say goodbye.

24:34.390 --> 24:35.766
I was going to tell you.

24:40.646 --> 24:42.606
I wanted to see her, too.

24:45.109 --> 24:46.777
This is fucked up.

24:47.861 --> 24:48.821
Yeah.

24:48.862 --> 24:50.281
What the fuck is happening?

24:51.282 --> 24:53.033
I don't know.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.836
Are you proposing...

25:14.263 --> 25:15.222
Mom!

25:15.264 --> 25:16.556
What are you doing?

25:16.598 --> 25:18.434
You scared the feces out of me!

25:18.476 --> 25:19.893
I'm 16.

25:19.935 --> 25:21.728
Please just say "shit" like everybody else.

25:21.770 --> 25:22.938
Language.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.273
What?

25:24.315 --> 25:26.817
"Feces" is grosser.

25:28.361 --> 25:30.279
Why are we spying on the Trakarskys?

25:30.321 --> 25:33.032
Don't be ridiculous.

25:33.073 --> 25:35.409
We aren't spying, honey.

25:35.451 --> 25:36.743
We're just...

25:36.785 --> 25:37.786
wondering.

25:39.330 --> 25:40.498
Okay.

25:57.306 --> 25:58.265
