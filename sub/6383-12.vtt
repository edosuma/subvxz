00:02.170 --> 00:04.874
How come you never told me
Bill's daughter was a writer?

00:05.596 --> 00:07.952
This girl's written what
could be the book of the year.

00:08.213 --> 00:09.119
Is that right?

00:09.380 --> 00:12.737
The girl's gonna sell 5 million copies
based on the jacket photo alone.

00:12.877 --> 00:16.210
- People are gonna recognize my writing.
- No, see, I covered my tracks.

00:16.471 --> 00:18.921
I added little bits of me
when I retyped it.

00:19.703 --> 00:22.242
You have done some fucked-up
shit in your time,

00:22.422 --> 00:24.923
- but I didn't think you'd do that.
- Not knowingly.

00:25.063 --> 00:26.865
I'll take it off the counter.
Say the word.

00:27.192 --> 00:28.847
- There are offers?
- Many.

00:29.007 --> 00:30.143
Then I'm fucked.

00:34.113 --> 00:36.486
Come on.
Hey, we were taking a break!

00:36.626 --> 00:38.820
Are you totally serious
about marrying Bill?

00:39.953 --> 00:42.736
- What about Hank?
- Are you questioning things?

00:42.997 --> 00:45.281
- I question everything, it's healthy.
- It is.

00:45.542 --> 00:48.325
I just think you can't
run off and marry a guy

00:48.465 --> 00:50.915
after making sweet
love to yours truly.

If anyone knows of a reason
why this couple should not wed,

01:15.993 --> 01:18.472
speak now or forever
hold your peace.

01:28.745 --> 01:29.745
What?

01:36.342 --> 01:38.083
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

01:38.344 --> 01:39.626
One minute. Time out.

01:39.996 --> 01:41.946
Since you are bringing it up,

01:42.160 --> 01:44.298
there is something
I would like to express.

01:44.561 --> 01:46.617
I just want to put it on the table.

01:48.281 --> 01:49.666
I've got a car...

01:50.166 --> 01:51.330
there's more.

01:51.665 --> 01:53.887
Just say the word,
and I'll pull it around front.

01:54.038 --> 01:55.725
You get in, you grab the Becca,

01:56.079 --> 01:57.353
off we go.

01:58.558 --> 02:02.089
I'm sorry. You're not invited.
Doesn't have much of a back seat.

02:03.260 --> 02:04.957
What do you say, Karen?

02:05.426 --> 02:06.831
It's not too late.

02:07.723 --> 02:09.173
It's never too late.

02:41.090 --> 02:42.261
Are you okay?

02:43.785 --> 02:44.785
Sweetie...

02:46.735 --> 02:49.943
- Just a bad dream.
- Better get moving.

02:50.416 --> 02:51.855
Wedding's at 3:00.

02:52.915 --> 02:54.493
I laid out your clothes.

02:55.861 --> 02:57.199
There's coffee.

03:01.893 --> 03:03.240
<i>Oh, happy day.</i>

03:51.687 --> 03:54.984
Okay, the fucking bunny goes
around the fucking left...

04:01.454 --> 04:03.891
My god, honey.
You look so beautiful.

04:04.746 --> 04:06.017
- Dad?
- Yeah?

04:06.682 --> 04:07.777
It happened.

04:08.579 --> 04:10.333
- What happened?
- It.

04:12.558 --> 04:13.558
It what?

04:14.076 --> 04:15.716
- It!
- It?

04:16.211 --> 04:17.232
The it!

04:17.456 --> 04:18.452
Oh, it!

04:19.745 --> 04:20.745
Shit.

04:21.841 --> 04:23.604
I'm so sorry, sweetie.

04:23.757 --> 04:26.030
I should have been set up
for such a momentous event

04:26.195 --> 04:27.928
in the life of a young woman.

04:28.088 --> 04:30.341
I should have had some
kind of kit prepared.

04:30.619 --> 04:32.883
Are you okay?
Do you need to sit down?

04:33.048 --> 04:35.302
Are you there, dad?
It's me, Becca. I'm fine.

04:35.442 --> 04:38.224
I'm not going to die or anything.
I just got my period.

04:40.264 --> 04:41.811
Can we keep moving?

04:49.816 --> 04:50.816
Oh, dear.

04:50.956 --> 04:52.906
- What?
- I kinda need those.

04:53.166 --> 04:55.316
I probably need them more than you.

04:57.670 --> 04:59.153
Let me buy them off you.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.538
Can I buy a couple?

05:01.516 --> 05:03.826
Let me just buy a couple
tampons from you.

05:04.094 --> 05:05.543
I can't buy one tampon?

05:05.816 --> 05:08.630
- No, I won't sell you one tampon.
- Do you have any cash?

05:09.175 --> 05:13.079
Why don't you try another store?
They make a lot of these things.

05:13.395 --> 05:15.553
You don't understand.
I'm in a big hurry.

05:15.824 --> 05:18.723
- I need those actual tampons.
- Bye now.

05:18.975 --> 05:21.059
Lady, you know what?
You're not very nice.

05:21.691 --> 05:24.800
- Excuse me?
- If I was in the market for, say...

05:25.080 --> 05:26.856
I don't know, adult diapers,

05:27.138 --> 05:29.150
and some poor,
incontinent soul walked by

05:29.426 --> 05:31.441
who obviously needed
them more than I did,

05:31.581 --> 05:34.405
- I would surrender those diapers.
- Good to know, asshole!

05:34.705 --> 05:37.027
- Everything OK?
- This guy's being a total dick.

05:37.443 --> 05:39.585
He's trying to steal my tampons.

05:39.783 --> 05:41.996
Why do you want to
steal a woman's tampons?

05:42.277 --> 05:45.833
I wasn't trying to steal her tampons.
I was trying to buy them off her.

05:46.095 --> 05:48.320
What the fuck you wanna buy
my wife's tampons for?

05:48.937 --> 05:51.255
You two are a charming couple.
You been together long?

05:51.525 --> 05:53.383
Are you looking
to get your ass kicked?

05:53.994 --> 05:56.844
Normally, I'd say, "go for it,
kick his ass,"

05:57.359 --> 05:59.639
but we're running out of time
here, dad.

05:59.900 --> 06:01.370
Sweetie, you're right.

06:01.510 --> 06:04.507
When you're right, you're right.
Let's blow this Popsicle stand.

06:04.713 --> 06:07.425
- Enjoy the shit out of your tampons.
- Thanks a lot.

06:14.415 --> 06:16.002
By the Heineken! You're open!

06:21.874 --> 06:23.538
She's the one who needs them?

06:23.821 --> 06:26.332
They're for me.
I like to use them as earplugs.

06:27.323 --> 06:28.292
First time?

06:28.950 --> 06:29.961
First time.

06:30.538 --> 06:33.089
- Where's your mother?
- She's getting married today.

06:33.354 --> 06:36.491
- We're on our way to the wedding.
- She's not married to your father,

06:36.642 --> 06:37.981
what a surprise.

06:39.963 --> 06:42.088
Do you need some help, sweetie?

06:42.444 --> 06:44.620
That's not a terrible idea, honey.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.285
I'm sorry.

06:55.064 --> 06:58.677
- What are you gonna do?
- When it comes to the woman I love,

06:58.871 --> 07:00.867
I don't think, I just act.

07:02.127 --> 07:04.737
- I messed you all up.
- No, that's cool.

07:05.451 --> 07:06.552
I'm sorry, man.

07:06.755 --> 07:08.160
- Am I good?
- Yeah.

07:08.332 --> 07:10.394
- How's the hair?
- Looks good.

07:10.694 --> 07:14.139
We're a blended family,
and I want the kids on that side...

07:16.990 --> 07:18.117
Hey, dad.

07:19.723 --> 07:20.842
Where's Karen?

07:21.306 --> 07:23.910
- Cold feet?
- That's very sweet of you,

07:24.050 --> 07:25.714
- very supportive.
- Don't worry.

07:25.986 --> 07:27.835
Throw a couple of
drinky-poo's in her,

07:28.023 --> 07:30.751
a roofie or two,
she's not going anywhere.

07:31.627 --> 07:34.555
You're lucky I have a very
sophisticated sense of humor.

07:35.145 --> 07:38.215
You'll miss my dark, sardonic wit
when I'm criss-crossing the nation

07:38.498 --> 07:40.152
- on my book tour.
- Yes...

07:40.990 --> 07:43.981
- About your book.
- You read it? What'd you think?

07:45.246 --> 07:48.158
I wanted to save this until
after we got back from the honeymoon,

07:48.425 --> 07:49.421
but...

07:50.413 --> 07:52.613
I can't, in good conscience,
let you publish it,

07:52.814 --> 07:54.874
not given the current national climate.

07:55.085 --> 07:57.637
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- Watch your language.

07:57.788 --> 08:00.235
- Where is this coming from?
- Believe it or not,

08:00.422 --> 08:03.930
I'm fairly successful at what I do,
and something called...

08:04.465 --> 08:06.259
"Fucking & Punching"

08:06.526 --> 08:08.549
by my 16-year-old daughter

08:08.811 --> 08:10.708
might bring me some
undesirable attention.

08:10.989 --> 08:12.837
You can't do this. It's my book.

08:12.977 --> 08:15.637
- I can do what I want with it.
- You wanna test me on this?

08:15.794 --> 08:17.622
I'm in business
with these publishers.

08:17.773 --> 08:20.132
I wanna make something go away,
it goes away.

08:20.336 --> 08:22.092
That's not what this is about...

08:22.524 --> 08:23.773
Your reputation.

08:24.045 --> 08:26.975
The content is a little unsettling,
wouldn't you agree?

08:27.279 --> 08:29.777
The whole thing reads like
some teenage girl's fantasy

08:29.944 --> 08:32.570
about having an affair
with some depraved asshole

08:32.732 --> 08:36.333
who bears a striking resemblance
to my least favorite American novelist.

08:38.078 --> 08:40.238
What makes you think it's fantasy?

08:49.911 --> 08:51.013
Take a hit.

08:51.380 --> 08:53.997
I can't get high on my wedding day. You're insane.

08:54.291 --> 08:55.492
Yes, you can.

08:55.734 --> 08:56.940
Yes, I did.

08:57.677 --> 08:59.562
Yeah, and look how that ended up.

08:59.870 --> 09:03.301
Now, you're aware
that once you say, "I do,"

09:03.595 --> 09:04.935
it's gonna be you...

09:06.735 --> 09:09.731
... and Bill's baby arm
for the rest of your life.

09:10.867 --> 09:13.065
- Can you handle that shit?
- That's big.

09:13.205 --> 09:16.445
A baby arm is very big, Marcy.
That's gonna hurt.

09:16.721 --> 09:18.478
Especially in the ass.

09:19.181 --> 09:21.331
Has Bill requested the ass yet?

09:21.601 --> 09:23.296
No, and he's not gonna get it!

09:23.436 --> 09:25.446
Not even on his wedding night?

09:25.601 --> 09:27.920
You don't deny your man the ass.

09:28.183 --> 09:31.756
You give it to him, because
once he knows he can have that,

09:32.242 --> 09:35.352
he ain't gonna want that shit anymore,
believe that.

09:35.762 --> 09:39.176
- I'm gonna take that.
- Yeah, the ass is always greener.

09:42.889 --> 09:46.270
Seriously, though, I think
you're doing the right thing here.

09:46.479 --> 09:49.853
You are so fucking full of shit.
You hated him.

09:50.134 --> 09:52.613
Last week,
you said he made your flavia shrivel.

09:52.813 --> 09:53.893
My labia.

09:54.269 --> 09:55.269
Sorry.

09:56.013 --> 09:58.117
No one was a bigger hater than me,

09:58.404 --> 10:00.204
- but Bill's a good guy.
- He is.

10:00.355 --> 10:02.648
- He's a man of substance.
- Yes.

10:02.944 --> 10:04.371
- He's not a lost boy.
- No.

10:04.650 --> 10:07.936
'Cause believe me, once you've seen
the love of your life

10:08.115 --> 10:11.035
hit in the face with
another woman's ejaculate,

10:12.339 --> 10:13.935
your perspective changes.

10:14.202 --> 10:15.620
It fucks you up.

10:15.908 --> 10:18.500
You lose your innocence.
That shit is fucked up.

10:26.233 --> 10:27.858
I slept with Hank.

10:30.410 --> 10:32.889
Okay, either I'm
really fucking baked,

10:33.029 --> 10:35.442
or you just told me
that you boned Hank.

10:35.729 --> 10:37.569
His dad had just died, so...

10:38.996 --> 10:41.147
- You're such a slut!
- I know.

10:41.654 --> 10:42.734
Was it good?

10:44.368 --> 10:45.497
It was sad.

10:46.051 --> 10:47.788
Like "coming and crying" sad,

10:48.586 --> 10:50.999
or like "dirty and shameful" sad?

10:52.532 --> 10:53.513
I don't know.

10:53.781 --> 10:55.772
- No, you stupid bitch!
- I'm good!

10:55.912 --> 10:57.614
You're gonna fuck your make-up!

10:57.782 --> 10:59.048
Happy thoughts!

11:06.668 --> 11:08.020
What up, Runkle?

11:08.936 --> 11:09.972
Hey there.

11:11.774 --> 11:15.239
- You better pace yourself, young lady.
- Why? I'm fucked.

11:15.653 --> 11:18.354
My dad won't let me publish
"Fucking & Punching."

11:18.538 --> 11:20.216
"National climate" and whatnot.

11:20.356 --> 11:23.214
Really? I don't really know
what you're talking about,

11:23.415 --> 11:25.959
"national climate and
whatnot," but that's good news.

11:26.261 --> 11:28.494
You got what was coming
to you after all.

11:28.963 --> 11:30.737
What do you know about it?

11:31.542 --> 11:33.751
I know you fucked and punched him

11:34.288 --> 11:36.195
set him up, stole his book.

11:37.705 --> 11:39.534
What are you gonna do about it?

11:39.682 --> 11:40.687
Spank me?

11:42.431 --> 11:44.513
You ladies talk about everything,
don't you?

11:44.786 --> 11:46.629
Just the stuff worth talking about.

11:46.813 --> 11:50.819
- How long did it take her to drop it?
- Two sips of a soy macchiato,

11:51.310 --> 11:54.222
but, hey, I always knew you had a
little bit of kink in you.

11:54.391 --> 11:55.309
I could tell.

11:56.626 --> 11:58.799
Yeah? You looking to get
a little of that now?

11:59.092 --> 12:01.364
You realize you're
hitting on a teenage girl?

12:01.644 --> 12:03.731
I thought that was your "thing."

12:03.905 --> 12:04.905
Gross.

12:05.094 --> 12:07.034
At least it all worked
out for the best, right?

12:07.384 --> 12:08.794
Hank gets his book back,

12:08.934 --> 12:12.026
and you get to crawl back to
the hole from whence you came.

12:13.430 --> 12:15.026
Hey, fuck that, Runkle.

12:15.291 --> 12:17.400
This ain't over till it's over.

12:31.478 --> 12:34.304
You, lilliputian,
you're going with me.

12:34.470 --> 12:36.715
- Don't scratch it.
- You, she wanna talk to you.

12:37.613 --> 12:39.170
You had sex with her!

12:39.354 --> 12:41.395
- She told you?
- She told me.

12:41.933 --> 12:45.547
And you gotta hit that shit again.
Give her some of that daddy dick.

12:45.731 --> 12:47.890
Fuck her into doing
the right thing here.

12:48.107 --> 12:50.735
There's something
seriously wrong with you,

12:50.902 --> 12:52.291
and you're stoned.

12:52.799 --> 12:55.343
Don't be harsh!
You're freaking me out.

12:55.527 --> 12:56.899
Behave yourself.

13:06.743 --> 13:08.383
You look incredible...

13:11.573 --> 13:14.217
Except for the makeup
which is a little hookerish.

13:14.426 --> 13:17.371
- Maybe that's what you're going for.
- Shut up.

13:18.290 --> 13:20.567
What took you so long?
Where is she?

13:20.962 --> 13:22.995
- Traffic was bad on the PCH.
- Right.

13:23.271 --> 13:26.325
- You're so full of...
- And Becca got her period.

13:27.761 --> 13:29.067
- What?
- Yeah.

13:29.375 --> 13:31.372
- She did?
- Makes perfect sense

13:31.533 --> 13:33.172
it'd happen on my watch, right?

13:33.464 --> 13:36.050
My God. How is she?
What did you do?

13:36.311 --> 13:39.008
- I handled the fuck out of that shit.
- You did?

13:39.215 --> 13:41.222
You mean you showed her how to...

13:41.492 --> 13:42.492
God, no.

13:42.636 --> 13:45.398
A very nice lady at
the supermarket helped us out.

13:45.710 --> 13:47.167
Jesus Christ, Hank!

13:47.987 --> 13:50.516
Fuck! It wasn't supposed
to be like this.

13:50.676 --> 13:53.294
I wasn't supposed to be
marrying some other guy,

13:53.458 --> 13:56.445
you weren't supposed to flush
your fucking career down the toilet,

13:56.706 --> 13:58.954
and Becca wasn't supposed
to start her period

13:59.122 --> 14:01.993
and some strange woman show her how
to use a tampon for the 1st time.

14:02.445 --> 14:06.027
All those things that weren't supposed
to happen... They happened.

14:08.211 --> 14:10.351
What happens next is up to you.

14:11.722 --> 14:13.546
I'm going through with it, Hank.

14:13.960 --> 14:17.817
- Go through with it, Karen.
- I can't cancel. It's not that simple.

14:18.144 --> 14:19.725
I'm not asking you to.

14:20.043 --> 14:22.418
I'm not gonna make some grand,
romantic gesture

14:22.575 --> 14:24.136
and ruin your wedding day.

14:25.353 --> 14:26.408
You're not?

14:27.774 --> 14:28.778
You promise?

14:29.445 --> 14:30.482
I promise.

14:35.118 --> 14:36.591
Good luck out there.

14:46.231 --> 14:49.881
And if anyone knows any reason
why these two should not be wed,

14:50.061 --> 14:52.752
please speak now or
forever hold your peace.

15:00.645 --> 15:01.655
Over here!

15:02.035 --> 15:03.679
Mia, what are you doing?

15:03.940 --> 15:07.224
Excuse me, I was told to speak
now or forever hold my peace.

15:07.503 --> 15:09.769
Was it just bullshit or
can I file my grievance?

15:10.404 --> 15:11.795
This could be interesting.

15:13.858 --> 15:15.197
Yeah, I just

15:15.893 --> 15:18.420
don't think I can fully endorse
this union.

15:18.712 --> 15:20.988
Get a load of the balls
on this chick.

15:21.259 --> 15:24.477
We should cut this part from
the ceremony. It's totally antiquated.

15:25.138 --> 15:27.633
Let her speak, okay? Mia? Come on.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.619
First of all,
you two don't even love each other.

15:33.119 --> 15:35.461
Yeah, you don't even
know what love is.

15:35.739 --> 15:38.954
- I love your dad, of course I do.
- Karen, all due respect,

15:39.235 --> 15:41.693
give me a fucking break.
You're still in love with Hank,

15:41.993 --> 15:44.594
and you know what? You should be.

15:46.304 --> 15:50.204
- He's obviously the guy for you.
- OK, I am so fucking high right now.

15:51.153 --> 15:53.501
I want you to be happy, I do.

15:54.324 --> 15:56.957
You totally deserve it.
You got a bum deal.

15:57.775 --> 16:00.836
You loved someone with your
whole heart, I know you did,

16:01.653 --> 16:03.318
and they up and died on you.

16:03.909 --> 16:05.102
That sucks...

16:06.044 --> 16:08.845
But you gotta get real,
you can't just play house.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.242
It's good.

16:11.786 --> 16:12.665
Hold on.

16:12.805 --> 16:16.117
If you marry Karen, you'll always
be staring down the barrel of Hank.

16:16.257 --> 16:17.452
Simple as that.

16:18.922 --> 16:21.269
- Let's take a little walk.
- You'd like that?

16:21.435 --> 16:24.241
We're gonna get some coffee,
smoke some cigarettes...

16:24.396 --> 16:25.438
Come here.

16:26.408 --> 16:27.873
Let it go. All right?

16:28.476 --> 16:29.535
Just let it go.

16:29.818 --> 16:31.170
If I can, you can.

16:32.789 --> 16:34.494
You think you can just shut me up?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.708
Of course you do,
just like you thought

16:36.858 --> 16:39.436
you could fuck me and never talk to me again.

16:41.162 --> 16:42.900
What is she talking about?

16:43.581 --> 16:45.489
You wanna tell them or should I?

16:48.378 --> 16:49.880
You fucked her, didn't you?

16:55.289 --> 16:57.131
Okay, you want to do this?

16:57.692 --> 16:58.747
For real?

16:59.115 --> 17:00.260
Do it right

17:00.664 --> 17:02.154
tell them the truth.

17:03.608 --> 17:04.914
What did you do?

17:06.295 --> 17:07.460
Tell them.

17:07.998 --> 17:10.111
Did you, or did you not,
sleep with him?

17:23.819 --> 17:24.983
Of course not.

17:26.201 --> 17:28.031
Give a girl some credit.

17:28.303 --> 17:29.638
It's just a book.

17:29.930 --> 17:31.381
A made-up story.

17:32.144 --> 17:34.204
It's fucking fiction, people!

17:43.460 --> 17:46.036
I don't give a damn about any
moment that's come before this.

17:46.223 --> 17:48.693
It's simple, Karen. I love you.

17:49.981 --> 17:52.460
Do you love me?
Do you want to marry me?

17:57.676 --> 17:59.115
Yes, I do.

19:19.167 --> 19:20.847
You wanna talk about it?

19:23.426 --> 19:24.614
You need a hug?

19:24.947 --> 19:25.947
Oh, no.

19:26.635 --> 19:28.085
Let me love you.

19:28.413 --> 19:30.050
Will you shut the fuck up?

19:35.098 --> 19:36.272
So, what now?

19:41.226 --> 19:43.201
I think maybe
I'll get into teaching.

19:44.152 --> 19:45.491
There's an idea.

19:45.805 --> 19:48.270
Not a particularly good one,
but an idea nonetheless.

19:48.896 --> 19:51.178
- Good luck with that.
- I hate you.

19:51.730 --> 19:52.901
I hate myself.

20:06.994 --> 20:08.823
Dance with your daughter?

20:09.317 --> 20:10.798
Don't mind if I do.

20:11.694 --> 20:12.915
Later, Runkle.

20:20.294 --> 20:21.884
I'm very proud of you.

20:22.185 --> 20:23.913
Really? And why is that?

20:25.281 --> 20:27.149
Because you got through it.

20:27.316 --> 20:29.589
And didn't get into
a fight with anyone.

20:30.520 --> 20:32.831
Well, you didn't start it,
at least.

20:34.611 --> 20:36.459
You're tragically flawed, dad,

20:37.690 --> 20:39.405
but you've got a good heart.

20:42.538 --> 20:43.877
I'll take that.

20:50.730 --> 20:53.039
Hello, sister. Mind if I cut in?

21:01.442 --> 21:03.450
I suppose I should thank you.

21:05.124 --> 21:07.333
- For what?
- Saving my ass.

21:08.304 --> 21:10.588
I'd say we're about even right now.

21:11.023 --> 21:12.144
How's that?

21:12.964 --> 21:15.789
My dad decided to
publish the book, so...

21:16.237 --> 21:19.835
I think he feels a lot better
knowing that we didn't have sex.

21:20.036 --> 21:21.124
But we did.

21:22.530 --> 21:23.530
Yeah.

21:25.214 --> 21:26.536
Yeah, we did.

21:27.461 --> 21:31.133
Once upon a time, I saw my favorite
writer in a bookstore and...

21:32.472 --> 21:33.710
I seduced him.

21:34.581 --> 21:37.281
So what, would it have been better

21:37.542 --> 21:41.040
to lose my virginity in the
back of some rich kid's beamer?

21:42.200 --> 21:44.204
Now you're really fucking with me.

21:45.948 --> 21:48.023
A girl never forgets her first.

21:56.792 --> 21:58.566
How you holding up, daddy?

22:00.523 --> 22:02.273
Don't worry about me.

22:02.413 --> 22:05.084
Worry about that poor
simpleton over there.

22:05.798 --> 22:08.175
You can call me whenever,
you know...

22:09.179 --> 22:10.054
Take that.

22:10.325 --> 22:12.650
Come on, you know you want
that bald eagle back.

22:12.910 --> 22:15.427
You made him suffer long enough.
He's been out there.

22:15.628 --> 22:18.579
There's nothing for him.
He's banged the forbidden fruit

22:18.897 --> 22:21.299
and now he's realized
that he'd rather be...

22:21.466 --> 22:23.702
Shucking your hairless clam.

22:26.678 --> 22:28.485
Hey, be nice to my clam.

22:31.012 --> 22:33.911
Hey, you,
dance with your fucking wife already.

22:36.185 --> 22:37.761
Be nice to her vagina.

22:49.741 --> 22:52.453
Well, I guess
congratulations are in order.

22:54.193 --> 22:55.193
You did it.

22:55.525 --> 22:56.931
Looks like I did.

22:57.579 --> 22:58.780
Good for you.

22:59.916 --> 23:02.026
This is starting
to give me dumb chills.

23:02.196 --> 23:05.025
- That's right, you're a woman now.
- Shut up.

23:07.729 --> 23:08.729
May I?

23:09.626 --> 23:10.626
Dance?

23:11.172 --> 23:12.172
You?

23:19.960 --> 23:22.454
Why didn't I dance
with you more often?

23:23.181 --> 23:25.460
Remember? You thought
it was stupid.

23:25.600 --> 23:26.906
Sounds familiar.

23:28.722 --> 23:32.283
And once again, the joke's on me,
because I'm the stupid one.

23:35.963 --> 23:39.177
You know, I'm sorry I never
gave you a day like today.

23:41.152 --> 23:43.548
I don't know what
I was so afraid of.

23:43.816 --> 23:44.920
So negative.

23:47.219 --> 23:48.843
Because I look around

23:49.136 --> 23:52.625
and I think it's the most beautiful
thing I've ever seen...

23:53.110 --> 23:54.516
aside from you.

24:02.852 --> 24:05.247
- I believe that's our daughter.
- She asked him.

24:05.397 --> 24:06.972
Don't stare, she'll kill us.

24:12.332 --> 24:14.156
Just all went by so fast.

24:15.910 --> 24:18.505
From the moment I met
you till just now...

24:20.111 --> 24:22.140
Seems like just a second ago.

24:31.424 --> 24:34.160
Excuse me, Hank. I wouldn't mind
dancing with my wife.

24:34.509 --> 24:35.447
Of course.

24:35.854 --> 24:38.565
Be good to her.
I had a shot with her once,

24:39.351 --> 24:40.595
but I blew it.

25:03.371 --> 25:05.670
That's what I call fucking, Runkle.

25:07.226 --> 25:08.430
You go, girl.

25:28.114 --> 25:30.223
Okay, don't push
your luck, Clapton.

25:30.424 --> 25:33.311
Becca, meet me in the car in
three and a half minutes.

25:33.610 --> 25:36.615
And you? No tongue. I'm serious.
That's not cool.

25:36.831 --> 25:40.191
"Check yourself, before
you wrigidy wrigidy wreck yourself."

25:47.912 --> 25:51.326
Stay away from musicians.
They're nothing but trouble.

25:52.060 --> 25:53.416
He asked me out...

25:54.269 --> 25:55.290
On a date.

25:56.796 --> 25:58.219
Captain fantastic.

25:59.845 --> 26:00.875
Can I go?

26:02.374 --> 26:03.929
Of course you can go.

26:04.799 --> 26:05.850
Impressed?

26:06.151 --> 26:07.151
Very.

26:07.686 --> 26:09.832
Maybe it's possible,
after all this time,

26:09.991 --> 26:12.276
for your old man to grow
the fuck up already.

26:13.672 --> 26:17.136
Maybe it happens anyways,
whether you like it or not.

26:23.391 --> 26:25.266
- Yeah!
- Pay up.

26:25.433 --> 26:28.345
I gave my last bill to the valet.
You're shit out of luck.

26:30.347 --> 26:31.619
Wait, Hank!

26:33.004 --> 26:34.002
Wait!

26:34.338 --> 26:35.495
Quick, quick!

26:35.762 --> 26:37.164
Just go, drive the car!

26:37.425 --> 26:38.417
You sure?

26:38.557 --> 26:40.781
Quick, before I change
my fucking mind!

26:40.948 --> 26:42.257
I'm sorry, baby.

26:43.774 --> 26:45.558
Karen, wait! Come back!
