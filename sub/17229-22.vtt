I GOT IT.
I GOT THE JOB!

19:42.799 --> 19:43.933
AAH! [ LAUGHS ]

19:43.933 --> 19:45.902
WAIT. WHAT ARE THOSE?

19:45.902 --> 19:46.936
[ GASPS ]

19:46.936 --> 19:49.439
DID WE WIN LUGGAGE, TOO?!

19:51.007 --> 19:54.010
[ Laughing ]
I AM HAVING A GREAT DAY!

19:54.010 --> 19:55.845
THOSE ARE FOR YOU.

19:55.845 --> 19:57.146
YOU'RE MOVING OUT.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.715
WHAT?

19:59.715 --> 20:03.619
I KNOW YOU TALKED WITH FELIX,
AND HE WAS WRONG.

20:03.619 --> 20:04.754
YOU HAVE A JOB NOW.

20:04.754 --> 20:06.756
IT'S TIME THAT YOU WENT OUT
ON YOUR OWN.

20:08.825 --> 20:12.061
B-BUT I HAVE
NO PLACE TO GO.

20:12.061 --> 20:15.765
A-A-AND THOSE WILL BE HARD
TO GET ON THE BUS.

20:15.765 --> 20:17.533
[ CHUCKLES ]

20:17.533 --> 20:19.102
I KNOW.
THOSE ARE EMPTY.

20:19.102 --> 20:22.705
I JUST WANTED IT TO BE DRAMATIC
SO YOU KNEW I WAS SERIOUS.

20:22.705 --> 20:26.843
YOU KNOW, JUST BECAUSE YOU <i>LOOK</i>
LIKE YOU BELONG IN A TELENOVELA

20:26.843 --> 20:29.779
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU SHOULD <i>ACT</i> LIKE IT.

20:31.414 --> 20:34.083
YOU'VE HELPED US OUT HERE
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

20:34.083 --> 20:36.786
AND I LOVE YOU
WITH ALL OF MY HEART FOR THAT.

20:36.786 --> 20:40.056
BUT IT'S TIME THAT YOU LIVED
THE LIFE OF A SINGLE GIRL,

20:40.056 --> 20:44.060
NOT THE LIFE OF A BEAUTIFUL,
MARRIED MOTHER OF TWO.

20:44.060 --> 20:46.996
ARE YOU SURE?

20:46.996 --> 20:48.998
I DON'T WANT
TO LEAVE YOU HERE.

20:48.998 --> 20:51.400
I MEAN,
THERE'S STILL <i>AMA</i> TO DEAL WITH.

20:52.768 --> 20:53.769
ABOUT THAT...

20:53.769 --> 20:56.539
OOH, ISN'T THIS EXCITING,
CRISTELA?

20:56.539 --> 21:00.143
WE'RE OFF TO LIVE THE LIFE
OF TWO SINGLE GIRLS!

21:02.812 --> 21:05.414
[ LAUGHS ]

21:09.619 --> 21:11.420
HEY, DANIELA,
SO, I CHECKED, AND THE, UH,

21:11.420 --> 21:13.589
THE APARTMENT ACROSS THE HALL
FROM ME IS AVAILABLE.

21:13.589 --> 21:15.691
I KNOW IT IS, 'CAUSE I CAN
SEE IT FROM MY BEDROOM.

21:18.094 --> 21:21.964
ONE DAY! YOU COULDN'T GIVE ME
ONE DAY TO BE HAPPY?!
