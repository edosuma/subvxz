WEBVTT

00:08.693 --> 00:11.028
Give me your tired,

00:11.030 --> 00:13.830
your poor, your huddled...

00:13.832 --> 00:15.666
Masses. Huddled masses.

00:15.668 --> 00:18.068
Yearning to breathe free.
Come on.

00:18.070 --> 00:20.304
Your huddled masses,
yearning to breathe free.

00:20.306 --> 00:21.672
Exactly.

00:21.674 --> 00:23.140
The wretched...

00:23.142 --> 00:25.008
The wretched...

00:25.010 --> 00:26.777
The wretched refuse
of your teeming shores.

00:26.779 --> 00:29.246
Jack, you're supposed
to know this by now.

00:29.248 --> 00:30.781
It's too hard.

00:30.783 --> 00:32.149
Why do I have to
learn some stupid poem

00:32.151 --> 00:33.950
on a stupid statue anyway?

00:33.952 --> 00:35.252
Watch your language!

00:35.254 --> 00:36.753
You should get a time out.

00:36.755 --> 00:38.055
Sean.
Sorry.

00:38.057 --> 00:39.256
What's the point?

00:39.258 --> 00:41.158
I'll never need to
know this in real life.

00:41.160 --> 00:43.327
Yes, you will.
How?

00:43.329 --> 00:45.162
Say I want to be a doctor.
You really think

00:45.164 --> 00:46.930
knowing this poem's gonna
help me save someone's life?

00:46.932 --> 00:48.565
In a matter

00:48.567 --> 00:49.866
of speaking, yes.

00:49.868 --> 00:51.234
Right?

00:51.236 --> 00:53.470
Right. I was just excited

00:53.472 --> 00:55.238
to hear him say
he wanted to be a doctor.

00:55.240 --> 00:56.773
Danny.

00:58.209 --> 01:01.411
<i>Let me delay her</i>
<i>for ten minutes.</i>

01:01.413 --> 01:03.380
She can sit outside
and cool her heels.

01:03.382 --> 01:04.715
Why?

01:04.717 --> 01:05.816
Message sent.

01:05.818 --> 01:07.184
You run the NYPD.

01:07.186 --> 01:09.419
You don't have a lot of time
for this nannying nonsense.

01:09.421 --> 01:11.388
She's gonna be smarter
than that, Garrett.

01:11.390 --> 01:13.523
Then, let me at least
bring the chiefs up.

01:13.525 --> 01:15.092
She can face down
a full house.

01:15.094 --> 01:17.427
She is the duly-appointed
inspector general, Garrett.

01:17.429 --> 01:19.596
Not some accomplice
we're trying to flip.

01:19.598 --> 01:21.932
All right, how do you
want this to go down?

01:25.002 --> 01:27.504
How do I want it to go?

01:28.639 --> 01:29.806
Seriously?

01:29.808 --> 01:31.675
Okay, okay.

01:31.677 --> 01:32.876
Some activist judge rules

01:32.878 --> 01:36.146
that highly-effective
NYPD policy is infringing

01:36.148 --> 01:39.116
on the citizens' civil rights,
so then,

01:39.118 --> 01:42.219
he goes to his buddies
at Dewey, Cheatem and Howe,

01:42.221 --> 01:44.654
and says, "How would you like
to bill the city

01:44.656 --> 01:46.289
"for a couple million a year

01:46.291 --> 01:47.858
"by appointing one
of your attorneys

01:47.860 --> 01:50.727
to be inspector general
to fix what isn't broke."

01:50.729 --> 01:53.463
It didn't exactly
go down like that.

01:53.465 --> 01:54.931
That's exactly how it went down!

01:54.933 --> 01:57.868
And nowhere in that process
did anybody ever say to me,

01:57.870 --> 02:00.437
"Hey, Frank,
how'd you like it to go?"

02:00.439 --> 02:01.671
Okay.
So, it's a little late

02:01.673 --> 02:04.541
to be asking me now!

02:06.077 --> 02:07.644
Show her in!

02:12.351 --> 02:13.884
Miss Peterson.

02:15.153 --> 02:18.455
Commissioner Reagan, Inspector
General Kelly Peterson.

02:19.590 --> 02:21.658
Kelly, please.

02:21.660 --> 02:24.961
Frank. Welcome
to One Police Plaza.

02:24.963 --> 02:27.130
Thank you for
seeing me.

02:29.333 --> 02:31.301
Excuse me.

02:33.838 --> 02:36.673
So, congratulations.

02:36.675 --> 02:39.276
Look, I won't insult you
by saying

02:39.278 --> 02:41.278
I know what you probably
think of me.

02:41.280 --> 02:42.979
I think you just did.

02:42.981 --> 02:44.848
No. No, no.

02:44.850 --> 02:46.483
That was an olive branch.

02:46.485 --> 02:49.820
Well, I've never met you,
so I have no opinion of you.

02:49.822 --> 02:51.922
Oh, but you do of my position.

02:51.924 --> 02:53.957
You've been broadcasting
your feelings about it

02:53.959 --> 02:56.092
ever since the judge ruled.
Yes,

02:56.094 --> 02:58.295
but that was before
I met the actual person

02:58.297 --> 03:00.197
behind the title.

03:01.833 --> 03:04.901
Miss Peterson...

03:04.903 --> 03:07.671
we're not going
to be colleagues or teammates

03:07.673 --> 03:11.641
or whatever hope they dangled
to get you to take the job.

03:11.643 --> 03:13.410
Before I joined the firm,

03:13.412 --> 03:15.946
I was the Essex County
prosecutor.

03:15.948 --> 03:17.247
I know that.

03:17.249 --> 03:18.448
Which should
tell you

03:18.450 --> 03:22.118
that I have enormous respect
for law enforcement.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.854
Just not the NYPD.

03:23.856 --> 03:26.790
Especially the NYPD.

03:26.792 --> 03:28.892
Then why did you take this job?

03:28.894 --> 03:31.061
Because I'd heard
their commissioner was a fair

03:31.063 --> 03:33.129
and honest man
who wanted the best

03:33.131 --> 03:34.564
for his department.

03:34.566 --> 03:36.466
You heard right.

03:36.468 --> 03:39.402
But you're going about it
the wrong way.

03:40.706 --> 03:43.073
I'm not good at small talk,
either.

03:43.075 --> 03:44.608
I just thought
we should meet

03:44.610 --> 03:45.942
face-to-face.

03:45.944 --> 03:48.044
And so we have.

03:48.046 --> 03:49.746
Of course, if we
were face-to-face,

03:49.748 --> 03:51.581
I'd have to climb
up on that desk.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.650
But this will do.

03:53.652 --> 03:55.886
Thank you for coming.

03:57.221 --> 03:59.122
You have a good day.

03:59.124 --> 04:02.993
I'll see myself out.

Move it!

04:23.849 --> 04:25.882
Move!

04:31.222 --> 04:33.223
Out of the way!
Hey, man.

04:33.891 --> 04:36.226
Watch out.

04:44.268 --> 04:46.770
Drop it, or I'll shoot!

04:46.772 --> 04:48.104
Reagan!

05:01.319 --> 05:03.253
Reagan?

05:03.255 --> 05:06.089
Jamie?!

05:06.091 --> 05:07.624
Eddie!

05:07.626 --> 05:09.893
Get on your feet.

05:13.998 --> 05:15.966
Look what I got.

05:21.505 --> 05:23.273
Get off me!

05:25.010 --> 05:26.476
Let go!

05:37.054 --> 05:38.555
Her name was Amy Lin.

05:38.557 --> 05:40.123
She was just
15 years old.

05:40.125 --> 05:43.059
She's just a kid. Unbelievable.

05:43.061 --> 05:44.494
This all you guys got?

05:44.496 --> 05:46.262
No other security cameras?

05:46.264 --> 05:47.931
It's the only one
in the station.

05:47.933 --> 05:49.599
But you were working
the token booth, right?

05:49.601 --> 05:51.434
Yeah.
Well, did you see anything?

05:51.436 --> 05:53.737
You hear anything? A cry for help?
No, man.

05:53.739 --> 05:55.138
I was listening
to the Knick game, you know.

05:55.140 --> 05:57.073
I mean, listen. The motorman
blew the long and the short,

05:57.075 --> 05:59.242
and I knew something was up,
but by the time I ran out there,

05:59.244 --> 06:00.610
it was... it was too late.

06:00.612 --> 06:02.212
And you didn't see
the guy at all?

06:02.214 --> 06:05.215
No. Just-just his back as he was
running out of the exit.

06:05.217 --> 06:06.783
The end of the platform.

06:06.785 --> 06:07.984
Okay, did he have any

06:07.986 --> 06:09.586
outstanding
identifying features?

06:09.588 --> 06:12.255
A scar, a tattoo, any
clothes that stuck out?

06:12.257 --> 06:16.359
No, but... I think
I recognize the guy.

06:17.962 --> 06:19.229
So, you knew the guy?

06:19.231 --> 06:20.964
No, no, no, no.
I didn't know him, know him.

06:20.966 --> 06:23.033
He was just some guy who used
to hang out in the station.

06:23.035 --> 06:24.167
Used to?

06:24.169 --> 06:25.301
Yeah, look,
the guy got

06:25.303 --> 06:26.736
real mental problems,
so I figured

06:26.738 --> 06:28.805
maybe they sent him away,
or something happened to him,

06:28.807 --> 06:30.306
but I guess he's back.

06:30.308 --> 06:31.841
What kind of mental problems?
Look,

06:31.843 --> 06:35.078
I'm not a doctor, but the dude
had real problems in the head.

06:35.080 --> 06:37.414
You know, he would be
all mellow and calm, and then,

06:37.416 --> 06:38.915
all of a sudden, just snap,

06:38.917 --> 06:40.016
he'd flip out and go crazy.

06:40.018 --> 06:41.184
Crazy how?

06:41.186 --> 06:42.519
You know, he'd, like,
yell at people,

06:42.521 --> 06:44.020
get in their faces,
be abusive.

06:44.022 --> 06:45.221
You know, a real nut.

06:45.223 --> 06:46.356
Okay.

06:46.358 --> 06:47.557
Did this nut have a name?

06:47.559 --> 06:48.625
Not a real name,

06:48.627 --> 06:50.560
but people in the hood
called him the Hulk.

06:51.662 --> 06:52.829
The Hulk?

06:52.831 --> 06:54.197
Yeah, the Hulk.

06:55.533 --> 06:56.666
On account of

06:56.668 --> 06:57.934
when he got angry?

06:57.936 --> 06:59.602
Exactly.

06:59.604 --> 07:01.337
Great.

07:01.339 --> 07:03.339
Wonder if he turned green, too.

07:37.413 --> 07:40.750
Tell us what
happened.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.419
Unfortunately,
we don't know yet, ma'am.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.087
It appears your daughter was

07:45.089 --> 07:46.155
in some kind of struggle

07:46.157 --> 07:48.123
before she was shoved
from the platform.

07:48.125 --> 07:49.625
Who is this man
who pushed her?

07:49.627 --> 07:51.794
Why would he want
to hurt our Amy?

07:51.796 --> 07:55.364
It's too early in
the investigation to know yet.

07:55.366 --> 07:58.067
I wish I could bring
your daughter back, but I can't.

07:58.069 --> 07:59.301
I can't even promise you

07:59.303 --> 08:01.270
that I'm gonna find the animal
who did this.

08:01.272 --> 08:03.305
But if he is gettable,

08:03.307 --> 08:04.974
I will get him.

08:09.045 --> 08:11.080
Actions... triumph...

08:11.082 --> 08:13.382
words.

08:25.662 --> 08:27.796
Please, forgive my father.

08:27.798 --> 08:29.632
He's old world.

08:29.634 --> 08:30.966
He doesn't mean any offense.

08:30.968 --> 08:33.836
David!

08:33.837 --> 08:35.404
None taken.

08:47.417 --> 08:48.651
Yeah.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.853
I ran a nickname check
on the Hulk and got a hit.

08:50.855 --> 08:52.955
Last known was
a homeless shelter

08:52.957 --> 08:54.423
near that subway station.

08:54.425 --> 08:55.424
You're kidding me.

08:55.426 --> 08:56.492
All right, text me an address.

08:56.494 --> 08:58.694
I'll meet you there.

09:00.463 --> 09:02.631
<i>We were responding</i>
<i>to a radio run</i>

09:02.633 --> 09:04.833
and we got a description

09:04.835 --> 09:06.368
of a male white wearing
an orange T-shirt,

09:06.370 --> 09:07.569
wanted for grand larceny.

09:07.571 --> 09:10.072
Wanted for a phone snatch.

09:10.074 --> 09:11.307
We saw a man

09:11.309 --> 09:13.509
fitting that description,
we called him over to us.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.210
At which point he fled.

09:15.212 --> 09:16.612
We both gave chase.

09:16.614 --> 09:19.348
And my pursuit was halted when
I collided with a pedestrian.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.850
But Officer Janko's
continued on foot.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.519
I pursued him into an alley

09:23.521 --> 09:25.087
where he took several swings
at me with a pipe.

09:25.089 --> 09:28.857
I drew my weapon,
ordered him to stop.

09:28.859 --> 09:32.061
He threw the pipe at me,
and then took off again.

09:32.063 --> 09:33.195
Were you injured?

09:33.197 --> 09:34.263
I ducked.

09:34.265 --> 09:35.864
And then chased him
down an alley

09:35.866 --> 09:37.666
where I was able to tackle him

09:37.668 --> 09:39.034
and place him
under arrest.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.969
Did you recover any property?

09:40.971 --> 09:42.004
I retrieved
the stolen smartphone

09:42.006 --> 09:43.706
from the defendant's back pocket

09:43.708 --> 09:46.275
after I placed him under arrest.

09:46.277 --> 09:48.210
Okay.

09:48.212 --> 09:50.312
Sign here.

09:50.314 --> 09:51.880
We'll hear

09:51.882 --> 09:52.848
what the defense has to say,

09:52.850 --> 09:54.683
but this looks
pretty cut-and-dry.

09:55.785 --> 09:58.120
Congrats on your first felony
arrest, Officer Janko.

09:58.122 --> 10:00.622
Huh, hey, thanks.

10:04.161 --> 10:05.928
<i>We have a problem.</i>

10:15.605 --> 10:17.606
A concerned citizen
e-mailed this

10:17.608 --> 10:20.976
to my office, thinking Officer
Janko used excessive force.

10:20.978 --> 10:23.212
The perp swung a pipe at a cop.

10:23.214 --> 10:24.813
He's lucky she didn't shoot him.

10:24.815 --> 10:27.082
The DA's office does not
have a problem with the level

10:27.084 --> 10:29.118
of force
the arresting officer used

10:29.120 --> 10:31.153
in making the arrest.

10:31.155 --> 10:32.321
There's something else.

10:32.323 --> 10:33.822
I triple checked it myself.

10:33.824 --> 10:36.892
Officer Janko told my ADA
that she retrieved

10:36.894 --> 10:38.260
the stolen cell phone

10:38.262 --> 10:40.896
from the pocket
of the defendant.

10:43.967 --> 10:45.968
That's not what she did.
At the very least,

10:45.970 --> 10:47.936
we need to drop this case.

10:47.938 --> 10:49.505
You asking me or telling me?

10:49.507 --> 10:51.640
The Manhattan District
Attorney's Office

10:51.642 --> 10:53.275
is declining to prosecute.

10:53.277 --> 10:55.644
You're gonna prosecute her
on perjury charges.

10:55.646 --> 10:56.879
Not at this time.

10:56.881 --> 10:58.547
But our office
is hoping

10:58.549 --> 11:01.450
a complete and thorough
investigation will be conducted.

11:01.452 --> 11:03.419
You know I will.

11:05.155 --> 11:06.355
Your boss know you're here?

11:06.357 --> 11:07.790
No.

11:08.625 --> 11:09.992
You talk to Jamie?

11:09.994 --> 11:11.627
I can't.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.165
The DA wants her shield.

11:16.167 --> 11:17.766
He's taking this

11:17.768 --> 11:19.568
to the inspector general.

11:22.138 --> 11:24.106
He's going over my head?

11:24.108 --> 11:27.476
He's not going over your head.

11:27.478 --> 11:29.778
It's policy now.

11:37.921 --> 11:40.489
I'm gonna talk

11:40.491 --> 11:43.091
to the head honcho. Look around,
see if you can't spot our Hulk.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.560
Copy that.

11:48.498 --> 11:49.998
Ma'am?

11:51.100 --> 11:52.034
You run this place?

11:52.036 --> 11:53.302
More like it runs me,

11:53.304 --> 11:55.170
but, yes, I suppose.

11:55.172 --> 11:56.738
Jeane Richards.

11:56.740 --> 11:58.240
I'm Detective Reagan.

11:58.242 --> 11:59.708
Do you recognize this man?

11:59.710 --> 12:02.277
Oh. Sure.

12:02.279 --> 12:03.312
That's Bernard.

12:03.314 --> 12:05.080
Bernard. Does Bernard have
a last name?

12:05.082 --> 12:06.215
Bernard Goodman.

12:06.217 --> 12:08.250
He used to be one
of our regulars here,

12:08.252 --> 12:11.019
but we haven't seen him
in quite some time.

12:11.021 --> 12:12.387
I hope he's okay.

12:12.389 --> 12:14.923
We believe he pushed
a 15-year-old girl to her death

12:14.925 --> 12:16.558
on the subway tracks last night.

12:16.560 --> 12:18.527
Oh, no. That's not possible.

12:18.529 --> 12:20.696
Bernard would never do
anything like that.

12:20.698 --> 12:22.297
Are you aware that people
in the neighborhood

12:22.299 --> 12:24.366
refer to him as Hulk?
Unfortunately

12:24.368 --> 12:26.935
some people who don't understand
the mentally ill

12:26.937 --> 12:29.037
resort to vicious name-calling.

12:29.039 --> 12:30.839
Okay, well, apparently
they call him that

12:30.841 --> 12:32.374
because when he loses
his temper,

12:32.376 --> 12:34.076
he turns
into a whole new person.

12:34.078 --> 12:36.845
Detective, I think most people
turn into another person

12:36.847 --> 12:38.146
when they get angry.

12:38.148 --> 12:41.083
Most people don't push
15 year olds into F trains.

12:41.085 --> 12:42.584
Bernard would never do that.

12:42.586 --> 12:44.152
I have a video
that says otherwise.

12:44.154 --> 12:45.554
Would you like
to take a look at it?

12:45.556 --> 12:47.756
No, I don't believe I would.

12:47.758 --> 12:50.292
Now, if you'll excuse me.

12:51.528 --> 12:53.228
Nothing?

12:53.230 --> 12:54.963
No, nothing but limo
liberalism run amuck.

12:54.965 --> 12:56.798
How about you?

12:56.800 --> 12:58.267
The blonde over there
in the corner?

12:58.269 --> 13:00.135
She was clocking
your convo pretty hard.

13:00.137 --> 13:02.604
You mean the one
that's suddenly making a beeline

13:02.606 --> 13:04.973
for the exit?
Yeah.

13:04.975 --> 13:07.543
Let's stay on her,
maybe she'll lead us to Hulk.

13:14.183 --> 13:16.184
Reagan, can we talk?

13:16.186 --> 13:17.753
You heard Sergeant Renzulli.

13:17.755 --> 13:19.621
You're the subject of an
official investigation.

13:19.623 --> 13:20.989
We shouldn't be
talking about this.

13:20.991 --> 13:21.924
You're my partner.

13:21.926 --> 13:23.225
I need to tell you
what happened.

13:23.227 --> 13:24.293
No, you don't. You need to talk

13:24.295 --> 13:25.827
to your lawyer only-- that's it.

13:25.829 --> 13:27.930
Jamie, please, let me explain.

13:27.932 --> 13:30.032
No, you got to keep your head
down and your mouth shut.

13:30.034 --> 13:32.834
Oh, oh, so that's
how it is, huh?

13:32.836 --> 13:34.102
Okay.

13:34.104 --> 13:36.305
Partner gets jammed up,
you run for the hills?

13:36.307 --> 13:38.440
You got jammed up?

13:38.442 --> 13:40.375
Eddie, I was sitting
right next to you

13:40.377 --> 13:41.276
when you lied to the DA.

13:41.278 --> 13:42.444
What makes you think

13:42.446 --> 13:44.046
IA isn't gonna come
swooping down on me?

13:44.048 --> 13:45.080
You're fine.

13:45.082 --> 13:46.048
No one's going to come after

13:46.050 --> 13:47.149
the commissioner's son.

13:47.151 --> 13:50.052
Think you're so smart, right?

13:50.054 --> 13:52.054
A hundred hours on the job,
you got it all figured out?

13:52.056 --> 13:54.590
Jamie, I didn't mean that.

13:54.592 --> 13:56.825
Yeah, you did-- you think I get
a pass because of my old man.

13:56.827 --> 13:57.993
And you're dead wrong.

13:57.995 --> 13:59.261
If anything it puts
a target on my back.

13:59.263 --> 14:01.229
And you just made it bigger.

14:01.231 --> 14:03.465
Jamie, Jamie, I'm sorry.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.901
I was out of line.

14:07.637 --> 14:09.037
I'm just confused and scared,

14:09.039 --> 14:11.473
and I-I don't know what to do.

14:15.578 --> 14:17.579
Head down,

14:17.581 --> 14:20.148
Mouth shut.

14:37.934 --> 14:39.301
She's heading under the bridge.

14:39.303 --> 14:41.136
There's a homeless
community under there.

14:41.138 --> 14:42.471
They'll make us
as cops in a second.

14:42.473 --> 14:43.872
I know.

14:45.341 --> 14:47.309
I'll take the south side. You
keep up the tail on Blondie.

14:47.311 --> 14:49.745
If she leads you to Bernard,
flush him out to me.

15:01.624 --> 15:02.691
Well,

15:02.693 --> 15:05.661
well, well,
what do we have here?

15:05.663 --> 15:07.629
Y-You looking

15:07.631 --> 15:09.865
for a place to crash,
pretty young thing?

15:09.867 --> 15:11.133
No, I'm fine.

15:11.135 --> 15:12.701
Damn straight, you fine.

15:12.703 --> 15:13.902
You real fine.
Hey.

15:13.904 --> 15:15.370
Hey! What the hell?!

15:17.640 --> 15:20.075
Police! Don't move!

15:20.410 --> 15:21.777
Look out.

15:38.327 --> 15:40.962
You have the right
to remain unconscious.

15:42.666 --> 15:46.601
I think we're gonna need
a bigger car.

15:57.614 --> 15:59.734
Okay, I'm gonna explain this
one more time, Bernard.

16:00.904 --> 16:02.571
You have the right
to an attorney.

16:02.573 --> 16:05.540
If you can't afford one, one
will be provided for you.

16:05.542 --> 16:07.475
I didn't do anything wrong.

16:07.477 --> 16:10.178
I'm sure you didn't do
anything wrong, Hulk.

16:12.815 --> 16:14.216
A little bit

16:14.218 --> 16:16.051
of a temper on you there,
huh, Hulk?

16:16.053 --> 16:17.619
Don't call me that.

16:17.621 --> 16:19.921
Says here you're supposed to be
in the state hospital.

16:19.923 --> 16:21.489
When did you get out?

16:22.859 --> 16:25.794
Okay, when did you stop
taking your meds?

16:25.796 --> 16:27.028
I don't remember.

16:27.030 --> 16:28.797
Do you remember why I want
to talk to you, Bernard?

16:28.799 --> 16:30.699
No.

16:30.701 --> 16:34.035
No? Well, let's see
if I can't refresh your memory,

16:34.037 --> 16:35.837
okay?

16:36.772 --> 16:38.506
You see
that picture?

16:38.508 --> 16:39.875
Is that you?

16:39.877 --> 16:41.309
I think so.

16:41.311 --> 16:42.978
You think so? I think so, too.

16:43.880 --> 16:47.015
And what about this?

16:48.417 --> 16:50.151
Do you remember this girl?

16:51.721 --> 16:52.787
Yeah?

16:52.789 --> 16:54.522
What do you remember
about her, Bernard?

16:54.524 --> 16:56.458
She was nice.

16:56.460 --> 16:57.592
She was nice.

16:57.594 --> 16:58.693
Do you remember

16:58.695 --> 17:01.162
what you did to this nice girl,
Bernard?

17:01.164 --> 17:03.565
I didn't do anything to her.

17:03.567 --> 17:04.598
Yes, you did.

17:04.601 --> 17:05.599
No, I didn't.

17:05.602 --> 17:07.569
Yes, you did.

17:07.570 --> 17:08.737
Look at me, Bernard.

17:09.605 --> 17:11.473
You hurt this nice girl.

17:11.474 --> 17:13.675
No, I didn't.
Yes, you did.

17:13.676 --> 17:15.175
I liked her. I...
You pushed her on the tracks

17:15.178 --> 17:16.645
She was nice to me!
in front of a train

17:16.646 --> 17:18.380
and you killed her.
No, I didn't!

17:18.382 --> 17:20.548
Look at the picture.

17:20.550 --> 17:22.717
Look at it! Right there.

17:24.520 --> 17:26.221
That's what you did to her, Bernard.
That's not what happened!

17:26.223 --> 17:27.314
Yes, you did.
That's not what happened!

17:27.339 --> 17:28.156
Yes, it is what happened.
You pushed her

17:28.157 --> 17:31.092
in front of a train, Bernard.
That's not what happened!

17:31.094 --> 17:32.294
I was trying to help her!

17:32.296 --> 17:35.063
You weren't trying to
help her! You killed her!

17:35.065 --> 17:37.232
I didn't kill her!

17:49.111 --> 17:50.378
The hell happened?

17:53.150 --> 17:54.883
This guy went crazy.

17:54.885 --> 17:56.551
Gonna be okay.

17:56.553 --> 17:58.158
We're missing something.

17:58.183 --> 17:59.588
We're not gonna hurt you.
You're okay here.

17:59.589 --> 18:02.724
We got to take another look
at that surveillance video.

18:02.726 --> 18:04.993
Calm down.
It's gonna be okay.

18:06.996 --> 18:09.965
I'd like the Salad
Nicoise, no egg

18:09.967 --> 18:12.067
and a side of frites.
Very good.

18:12.069 --> 18:13.868
That sounds good.
I'll have the same.

18:13.870 --> 18:16.371
Yes, sir.

18:16.373 --> 18:18.907
Look, we agreed
on something.

18:18.909 --> 18:21.009
But don't blink
or you missed it.

18:21.011 --> 18:24.079
You're probably wondering
why I invited you to lunch.

18:24.081 --> 18:26.748
Last night...

18:26.750 --> 18:29.784
couldn't sleep.
You know what that's like.

18:29.786 --> 18:31.786
You have nights
like that. Anyway,

18:31.788 --> 18:33.688
I'm flipping
through the channels

18:33.690 --> 18:35.957
and on comes
<i>Bridge on the River Kwai.</i>

18:35.959 --> 18:37.692
Oh. Masterpiece.

18:37.694 --> 18:41.029
Yes. With those great scenes
with Alec Guinness

18:41.031 --> 18:43.531
and Sessue Hayakawa, the P.O.W.

18:43.533 --> 18:45.533
and the concentration
camp commander,

18:45.535 --> 18:49.371
and even though Hayakawa is
his enemy, Guinness decides...

18:49.373 --> 18:51.773
Colonel Nicholson was
the character's name, I think.

18:51.775 --> 18:53.041
That's very good.

18:53.043 --> 18:55.410
Well...
Anyway, Guinness decides

18:55.412 --> 18:59.981
to build his enemy
the best bridge he can,

18:59.983 --> 19:02.984
out of pride,
a sense of legacy...

19:02.986 --> 19:04.319
A greater purpose.

19:04.321 --> 19:07.188
He compromised his men
and his command.

19:07.190 --> 19:11.126
It drove him to madness,
and it cost him his life.

19:11.128 --> 19:12.961
You asked me
to have lunch

19:12.963 --> 19:16.131
because you want
to fire Officer Janko

19:16.133 --> 19:17.999
and you want me
to sign off on it.

19:18.001 --> 19:20.702
She's guilty, Frank,
and you know it.

19:20.704 --> 19:22.637
Mm. Not in any real sense.

19:22.639 --> 19:26.674
But... she does make
a terrific sacrificial lamb.

19:26.676 --> 19:28.610
With the added bonus
that you would know

19:28.612 --> 19:32.414
that she is my son
Jamison's partner

19:32.416 --> 19:34.249
and that I am
known hopefully

19:34.251 --> 19:37.986
for avoiding any appearance
of favoritism

19:37.988 --> 19:40.088
where my family is concerned.

19:40.090 --> 19:41.689
She's low-hanging fruit.

19:41.691 --> 19:45.427
I show my title has teeth
and you get to be a team player.

19:45.429 --> 19:48.763
If you say "win-win,"
I'll never return another call.

19:48.765 --> 19:51.666
It's an opportunity.

19:54.036 --> 19:55.570
I've had

19:55.572 --> 19:56.871
to fire other officers.

19:56.873 --> 19:59.274
I've never considered it
an opportunity.

19:59.276 --> 20:02.377
The answer is no,
and it's not changing.

20:02.379 --> 20:06.781
If that's my cue to leave,
I'm staying.

20:06.783 --> 20:08.550
So am I.

20:08.552 --> 20:10.385
Well, then?

20:11.220 --> 20:13.288
Small talk.

20:13.290 --> 20:15.390
We can try.

20:15.392 --> 20:17.358
Ladies first.

20:24.201 --> 20:25.300
There.

20:25.302 --> 20:26.935
Right there.
Play it back again.

20:28.971 --> 20:31.439
There.

20:31.441 --> 20:32.874
Did you see that?

20:32.876 --> 20:35.643
Reagan, you're losing it.
All I saw was him push her.

20:35.645 --> 20:36.744
Hold on, hold on.

20:36.746 --> 20:38.880
Look close.

20:40.883 --> 20:43.184
He's not pushing her.
She's pushing him.

20:43.186 --> 20:45.320
What?
Wa-Watch, watch.

20:45.322 --> 20:47.989
All right, look. See?
She stomps on his foot.

20:47.991 --> 20:50.558
She pushes off. He's still
trying to hold on to her.

20:50.560 --> 20:51.993
But she's pushing
off him.

20:51.995 --> 20:54.262
He was forced to let her go.

20:58.200 --> 20:59.901
Oh, my God.
I don't think

20:59.903 --> 21:02.237
he was trying to kill her.
He was trying to save her.

21:03.105 --> 21:04.772
Suicide?

21:11.981 --> 21:14.582
You Detective Reagan?
Yeah.

21:14.584 --> 21:16.417
I called.
Is this the vic's belongings?

21:16.419 --> 21:17.619
Sign here.

21:17.621 --> 21:18.820
You called just in time.

21:18.822 --> 21:21.189
I was about to forward this
to the family.

21:21.191 --> 21:22.724
Oh, lucky for us.

21:22.726 --> 21:25.627
Here you go.

21:27.096 --> 21:29.097
Anything?

21:29.099 --> 21:31.399
No suicide
note, Reagan.

21:36.038 --> 21:38.106
There's got
to be something here.

21:40.643 --> 21:41.743
Hold on.

21:41.745 --> 21:43.745
It's right here.

21:43.747 --> 21:45.079
Written but unsent.

21:45.081 --> 21:48.750
"Dear Mom and Dad,
I can not endure this agonizing

21:48.752 --> 21:49.884
"pain any longer.

21:49.886 --> 21:51.186
"I love you all.
Forgive me.

21:51.188 --> 21:53.288
Amy."

21:53.290 --> 21:55.456
<i>Detective, thank you</i>

21:55.458 --> 21:56.991
for sharing this with us.

21:56.993 --> 21:58.726
We are very appreciative.

21:58.728 --> 22:00.562
Now, if

22:00.564 --> 22:02.764
you'll excuse me.

22:07.570 --> 22:11.239
Mr. Lin doesn't know Amy's pain.

22:13.008 --> 22:15.510
I wonder if you do.

22:15.512 --> 22:18.880
My husband and I
share everything.

22:18.882 --> 22:21.216
I know nothing more than him.

22:21.218 --> 22:23.851
My wife
and I share everything, too,

22:23.853 --> 22:26.020
but I know she's the mom
to my two boys,

22:26.022 --> 22:28.189
and there are things
that they will tell her

22:28.191 --> 22:29.524
that they won't tell me.

22:29.526 --> 22:31.659
Things that a child

22:31.661 --> 22:33.595
will only tell their mother.

22:33.597 --> 22:35.830
You understand?

22:41.837 --> 22:44.072
Amy was having problems
at school.

22:44.074 --> 22:47.041
Someone was saying
terrible things about her.

22:47.043 --> 22:48.476
What kind of things?

22:48.478 --> 22:52.347
Horrible, vicious, hateful lies.

22:52.349 --> 22:54.882
Do you know who this person was?
Do you have a name?

22:54.884 --> 22:59.621
They are a coward who hide
behind a computer screen.

22:59.623 --> 23:00.922
A cyber bully?

23:00.924 --> 23:02.890
Mrs. Lin, do you know

23:02.892 --> 23:05.927
where I can read these things
that this person wrote?

23:22.444 --> 23:23.044
This was Amy's.

23:32.921 --> 23:35.790
I want her report sent out
to me immediately.

23:39.128 --> 23:41.062
The Inspector General, Dad?

23:41.064 --> 23:43.231
She's recommending
Janko's termination.

23:46.268 --> 23:47.568
Surprise, surprise.

23:47.570 --> 23:48.870
Your partner

23:48.872 --> 23:51.472
was given the opportunity
to recant her story,

23:51.474 --> 23:53.474
but she refused.

23:53.476 --> 23:55.443
She's been on the job a month.
She's scared.

23:55.445 --> 23:57.712
She also lied to the
district attorney's office.

23:57.714 --> 24:00.081
Don't do the crime if you can't
do the time. Right, Gramps?

24:00.083 --> 24:03.217
Sorry, kiddo, but what she did
is not a crime in my book.

24:03.219 --> 24:06.054
You're not advocating
lying, are you, Grandpa?

24:06.056 --> 24:07.355
You're damn right I am.

24:07.357 --> 24:08.556
We can lie?

24:08.558 --> 24:09.824
No, you can't.

24:11.160 --> 24:13.361
Right?

24:13.363 --> 24:15.263
No, you can't lie.

24:15.265 --> 24:16.898
But Officer Janko didn't lie.

24:16.900 --> 24:18.399
She said that she

24:18.401 --> 24:20.168
removed that phone
from his back pocket

24:20.170 --> 24:22.437
- when, in fact, she recovered it...
- Come on.

24:22.439 --> 24:24.138
...from the ground
a few feet away.

24:24.140 --> 24:25.673
Come on, that punk
not only stole a phone,

24:25.675 --> 24:27.141
but tried to hit
a cop with a pipe.

24:27.143 --> 24:28.643
There is a difference

24:28.645 --> 24:29.911
between truth and fact.

24:29.913 --> 24:31.713
And the truth is, your
Uncle Jamie's partner

24:31.715 --> 24:33.581
took a bad guy off
the street, period.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.582
No matter what the cost?

24:34.584 --> 24:35.783
No matter the
cost. Look,

24:35.785 --> 24:36.951
sometimes a cop's got

24:36.953 --> 24:39.120
to take some liberties.
Oh, some liberties?

24:39.122 --> 24:41.723
Call it what you want--
latitude, making a call.

24:41.725 --> 24:43.124
That's right. Cops don't

24:43.126 --> 24:44.659
take leeway,
then there'd be twice

24:44.661 --> 24:46.961
as many bad guys
running around on the streets.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.364
Care to define exactly where
that line is, Detective Reagan?

24:49.366 --> 24:51.632
- No, I don't care to define anything.
- An experienced cop knows

24:51.634 --> 24:54.969
when he can...
and when he can't.

24:57.740 --> 24:59.006
Jamie Reagan!

24:59.008 --> 25:00.274
Come on, Erin.

25:00.276 --> 25:01.476
It happens every day,
and you know it.

25:01.478 --> 25:02.944
Just because it happens
doesn't make it right.

25:02.946 --> 25:05.079
You actually
agree with them?

25:05.081 --> 25:06.614
A couple of years ago,
maybe not,

25:06.616 --> 25:08.483
but after being
in the streets every day,

25:08.485 --> 25:09.851
it's not always black and white.

25:09.853 --> 25:11.419
Yeah, you see that?

25:11.421 --> 25:12.820
Even Harvard Law agrees

25:12.822 --> 25:15.523
that sometimes the ends
justify the means.

25:15.525 --> 25:16.858
Exactly. If I'm still

25:16.860 --> 25:20.328
a PC, I buy the lady cop
a steak dinner.

25:20.330 --> 25:21.529
Well, let's give thanks

25:21.531 --> 25:24.399
today that you are not
and Dad is.

25:26.001 --> 25:28.102
Want to shine some
light here, Dad?

25:29.605 --> 25:35.009
I'm five years on the job,

25:35.011 --> 25:36.844
and I see a male white coming
down 1-2-5 toward Lex.

25:36.846 --> 25:39.614
I don't like what I see, but I
can't tell you exactly why.

25:39.616 --> 25:41.015
Just instinct kicking in.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.851
So, I toss him,
come up with a gun.

25:45.387 --> 25:48.022
Traces back to two dead bodies.

25:48.024 --> 25:49.891
So, on the stand,

25:49.893 --> 25:52.960
I testify
that I stopped the defendant

25:52.962 --> 25:54.762
after observing him
put his hand

25:54.764 --> 25:56.898
on what appeared
to be the butt of a gun.

25:56.900 --> 25:59.467
And he went for the full 20.

26:01.637 --> 26:03.237
As a cop

26:03.239 --> 26:05.440
and as a man,

26:05.442 --> 26:08.109
I sleep just fine on that score.

26:32.443 --> 26:33.966
"You're a filthy whore.

26:33.967 --> 26:35.708
Everyone knows you're a skank"?

26:36.001 --> 26:38.168
What the hell kind
of Web site is this?

26:38.170 --> 26:40.136
It's called GossipAtGilbert.com.

26:40.138 --> 26:41.938
Gilbert's the name
of Amy's high school.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.306
You can do the math.

26:43.308 --> 26:45.275
Is this what it's like for
teenagers out there today?

26:45.277 --> 26:46.843
Afraid so.

26:46.845 --> 26:49.512
And my Jack's gonna be 13
this year.

26:49.514 --> 26:51.548
Oh, good luck with that.

26:51.550 --> 26:53.016
Detective Reagan?
Yeah.

26:53.018 --> 26:54.551
We got some information
on the person

26:54.553 --> 26:55.852
who posted the comments
in question.

26:55.854 --> 26:57.587
What is it?
We were able to trace

26:57.589 --> 26:58.722
the poster's IP.

26:58.724 --> 27:00.290
It originated
from an address in Queens.

27:00.292 --> 27:02.892
Same neighborhood as Amy.

27:02.894 --> 27:06.129
Thanks. Run a reverse directory
on that, see what pops.

27:09.967 --> 27:11.301
Melissa and Richard Clarke.

27:11.303 --> 27:12.802
Any kids?

27:12.804 --> 27:14.437
15-year-old daughter, Stacey,

27:14.439 --> 27:17.574
a sophomore...
at Gilbert High School.

27:17.576 --> 27:19.776
GossipAtGilbert.com.

27:19.778 --> 27:21.978
Let's go.

27:31.188 --> 27:33.189
You sure you should
be doing that?

27:33.191 --> 27:36.026
You gonna arrest me?

27:41.065 --> 27:44.467
You're firing Officer Janko.

27:44.469 --> 27:46.636
Shouldn't I?

27:47.972 --> 27:49.939
Not for me to say.

27:49.941 --> 27:52.375
But you got an opinion.

27:52.377 --> 27:55.311
The statement that she gave
the DA's office didn't match up

27:55.313 --> 27:56.780
with what was on the video.

27:56.782 --> 27:59.883
So you agree with
the inspector general?

28:00.751 --> 28:02.919
Not at all.

28:02.921 --> 28:04.454
Because?

28:04.456 --> 28:05.989
I don't know.

28:05.991 --> 28:07.724
It just doesn't add up.

28:07.726 --> 28:10.126
I mean, I've been riding
in the car with her

28:10.128 --> 28:11.761
for a while now, and I just...

28:11.763 --> 28:14.097
I can't see her flat out lying
about something like this.

28:14.099 --> 28:17.167
Jamie, I went back
over her testimony.

28:17.169 --> 28:20.136
She had five chances to
recant, and she wouldn't,

28:20.138 --> 28:22.405
even though it might
have saved her job.

28:22.407 --> 28:24.207
I-I think she stuck to her story

28:24.209 --> 28:26.443
because she still
believes it to be true.

28:26.445 --> 28:27.844
So do I.

28:27.846 --> 28:29.412
She's being accused

28:29.414 --> 28:30.647
of lying when, in fact,

28:30.649 --> 28:33.483
she believes she's
telling the truth.

28:33.485 --> 28:35.452
Her brain blocked
out everything

28:35.454 --> 28:39.055
except what she needed
to do to survive.

28:39.057 --> 28:41.191
Her head was
playing tricks on her.

28:41.193 --> 28:45.228
It was a mistake of the
mind, not of the heart.

28:53.003 --> 28:54.671
Good afternoon.

28:54.673 --> 28:56.206
Mrs. Clarke?

28:56.208 --> 28:58.007
That's right.

28:58.009 --> 29:00.043
Detective Reagan,
this is Detective Baez.

29:00.045 --> 29:01.644
Are you Stacey's mom?

29:01.646 --> 29:03.713
Yes. Is everything okay?

29:03.715 --> 29:06.149
We have a warrant
to seize any and all computers

29:06.151 --> 29:07.584
you may have on the premises.

29:07.586 --> 29:09.185
Excuse me?

29:09.187 --> 29:11.254
Sorry for the
intrusion, ma'am.

29:11.256 --> 29:12.856
This shouldn't
take long.

29:12.858 --> 29:15.058
What... what is
going on here?

29:15.060 --> 29:16.626
Ma'am, we believe
your daughter Stacey

29:16.628 --> 29:18.294
may have been harassing
another student online.

29:18.296 --> 29:20.730
That's not possible.
Stacey's a good girl.

29:20.732 --> 29:23.099
She would never do anything
like that.

29:23.101 --> 29:24.234
Is your daughter
Stacey home?

29:24.236 --> 29:25.568
I'd like to ask her
a few questions.

29:25.570 --> 29:27.170
No, absolutely not.

29:27.172 --> 29:28.538
Mrs. Clarke,
this harassment

29:28.540 --> 29:30.707
led your daughter's classmate
to take her own life

29:30.709 --> 29:33.143
by jumping in front of a train
the other day.

29:33.145 --> 29:35.145
Oh, my God.

29:35.147 --> 29:37.680
This is about that?

29:37.682 --> 29:40.250
Did your daughter know Amy Lin?

29:40.252 --> 29:42.585
No, not that I know of, but...

29:42.587 --> 29:44.387
But what?

29:45.356 --> 29:47.790
I shouldn't be
telling you this, but...

29:48.559 --> 29:50.160
Stacey hasn't left her room

29:50.162 --> 29:53.930
since the school told us
what happened to that poor girl.

29:55.099 --> 29:57.033
You know, it's really important

29:57.035 --> 29:59.569
that we ask her a few questions.

30:14.018 --> 30:15.818
You found the place.

30:15.820 --> 30:17.453
Kind of sorry I did.

30:17.455 --> 30:19.022
What are we doing here?

30:19.024 --> 30:22.859
Kelly, I'm willing to sign off

30:22.861 --> 30:26.129
on your recommendation
to terminate Officer Janko.

30:27.164 --> 30:28.698
On one condition.

30:28.700 --> 30:32.135
You realize I don't
need you to sign off.

30:32.137 --> 30:34.270
I do. And you realize

30:34.272 --> 30:37.473
your new job gets real hard,
real fast if I don't.

30:37.475 --> 30:40.877
Fair enough.
What's the condition?

30:42.546 --> 30:44.681
When you had a carry permit
in Newark,

30:44.683 --> 30:47.450
it was for a Glock,
as is your permit here.

30:47.452 --> 30:50.987
Are you proposing a duel, Frank?

30:50.989 --> 30:54.724
No. An NYPD training exercise.

30:54.726 --> 30:56.192
What's your point?

30:56.194 --> 30:59.295
If you're gonna pass that kind
of judgment on someone,

30:59.297 --> 31:03.199
you damn sure better first walk
a mile in that person's shoes.

31:09.406 --> 31:10.740
I-I didn't write these things.

31:10.742 --> 31:12.642
I would never write
those things about anyone,

31:12.644 --> 31:14.110
especially not Amy.

31:14.112 --> 31:16.246
You know, your mom says
you've been pretty upset

31:16.248 --> 31:17.680
since Amy killed herself. Why?

31:17.682 --> 31:19.515
One of our classmates
killed themself.

31:19.517 --> 31:20.984
Everyone at school
is traumatized.

31:20.986 --> 31:23.353
I understand that, but
our techs traced the posts

31:23.355 --> 31:25.688
in question to a
computer in this house.

31:26.490 --> 31:27.991
Can you explain that?

31:27.993 --> 31:30.960
I can't,
but that doesn't mean I did it.

31:30.962 --> 31:33.529
Stacey, I know
that you're afraid,

31:33.531 --> 31:36.065
but I can only help you
if you tell me the truth.

31:36.067 --> 31:37.634
I am telling you the truth.

31:37.636 --> 31:39.869
My partner is in your bedroom
right now,

31:39.871 --> 31:41.304
going through your computers.

31:41.306 --> 31:42.872
Are you telling me that
she's not gonna uncover

31:42.874 --> 31:44.440
something you're trying to hide?

31:45.276 --> 31:46.809
'Cause you know
what I think.

31:46.811 --> 31:50.513
I think the reason you're upset
is because you feel guilty.

31:50.515 --> 31:52.649
Because you wrote all
those terrible things

31:52.651 --> 31:53.850
and now you hate yourself

31:53.852 --> 31:55.585
because that's
what drove Amy

31:55.587 --> 31:57.186
to those tracks the other night.

31:57.188 --> 31:58.988
Detective...
Is that right?

31:58.990 --> 32:00.523
No.
Stacey...

32:00.525 --> 32:02.058
I didn't write those things!

32:02.060 --> 32:03.993
Well, you did something!
Yeah, I did! I did!

32:03.995 --> 32:05.094
Detective, that's enough!
What did you do?

32:05.096 --> 32:06.062
Well, what did you do?!

32:06.064 --> 32:07.697
I loved her!

32:11.603 --> 32:13.436
What?

32:13.438 --> 32:16.639
I loved her.

32:17.808 --> 32:20.410
That's what I did.

32:21.879 --> 32:23.846
We were in love.
We'd been seeing each other

32:23.848 --> 32:25.348
for the past three months.

32:25.350 --> 32:27.884
Oh, my...
Someone at school

32:27.886 --> 32:30.253
found out and then...

32:30.255 --> 32:33.289
then Amy started
getting harassed.

32:33.291 --> 32:34.724
Harassed by whom?

32:34.726 --> 32:36.592
It doesn't matter.

32:36.594 --> 32:37.727
No, it does matter.

32:37.729 --> 32:39.329
I can't... I can't say.
Stacey, tell him

32:39.331 --> 32:40.363
right now.
No! I...

32:40.365 --> 32:42.565
I promised Amy.
And I am telling you

32:42.567 --> 32:44.367
that Amy would want you to tell.
No,

32:44.369 --> 32:46.102
she really wouldn't.
Danny,

32:46.104 --> 32:47.704
you need to see this.

32:47.706 --> 32:49.272
Somebody who knows his way
around a computer

32:49.274 --> 32:50.873
put up a false IP
at this address.

32:50.875 --> 32:52.875
We just found this
e-mail Amy sent to Stacey

32:52.877 --> 32:55.545
a few hours before she jumped.

32:55.547 --> 32:57.914
"My brother David and I just got
into a huge fight.

32:57.916 --> 33:00.316
"He got so pissed when I told
him I knew it was him

33:00.318 --> 33:02.485
"posting those awful
things about me.

33:02.487 --> 33:04.387
"Now he's saying
that if I don't stop seeing you

33:04.389 --> 33:08.591
"immediately, he's gonna tell
my parents everything about us.

33:08.593 --> 33:09.859
"I don't know what to do.

33:09.861 --> 33:11.761
No matter what
happens, I love you""

33:11.763 --> 33:13.830
David was harassing
his own sister.

33:13.832 --> 33:15.098
Yeah.

33:16.700 --> 33:18.634
Why would he do
that to his sister?

33:20.138 --> 33:23.973
Because loving me would bring
shame to the Lin family.

33:40.232 --> 33:45.136
The ammunition was designed
specifically for this exercise,

33:45.138 --> 33:48.606
but the weapon functions exactly
like your Glock.

33:48.608 --> 33:51.309
I used the Jersey State
Trooper's simulator

33:51.311 --> 33:52.810
when I first learned to shoot.

33:52.812 --> 33:53.878
Oh, good.

33:53.880 --> 33:55.313
This is not that.

33:55.315 --> 33:57.782
I know my way around a drill.

33:57.784 --> 34:00.017
You're feeling confident--
that's good, too.

34:00.019 --> 34:00.952
All right.

34:00.954 --> 34:02.219
The warrant
you're serving

34:02.221 --> 34:04.188
is for the owner of this house.

34:04.190 --> 34:07.892
You do not know who is inside
or if anyone is armed.

34:07.894 --> 34:09.560
I would love to go in
with you as your backup,

34:09.562 --> 34:13.331
but Officer Janko walked down
that alley alone.

34:19.804 --> 34:21.105
Police.

34:22.442 --> 34:23.940
Go.

35:29.609 --> 35:31.742
Three out of four ain't bad.

35:31.744 --> 35:33.277
I'm still dead.

35:33.279 --> 35:35.212
Even dead, she keeps talking.

35:35.214 --> 35:37.481
I got to say,
that was incredible.

35:37.483 --> 35:39.450
What an adrenalin rush.

35:39.452 --> 35:41.786
Yes, it is.

35:43.222 --> 35:45.723
I have some questions.

35:45.725 --> 35:47.058
What color shirt

35:47.060 --> 35:49.460
was the first assailant wearing?

35:49.462 --> 35:52.096
Uh... blue.

35:52.098 --> 35:53.230
Red.

35:53.232 --> 35:55.566
And what kind
of weapon

35:55.568 --> 35:57.368
was the third perp carrying?

35:57.370 --> 35:59.570
A Glock, same as me.

36:00.405 --> 36:02.973
Actually, it was a knife.

36:02.975 --> 36:04.675
No.
I saw it.

36:04.677 --> 36:05.943
It was a Glock.

36:05.945 --> 36:07.411
Officer Harvey?

36:13.485 --> 36:15.419
How many times

36:15.421 --> 36:16.287
did you fire?

36:16.289 --> 36:18.489
Seven. No...

36:20.092 --> 36:22.059
Eight.

36:22.061 --> 36:25.162
You emptied your weapon.
16 shots.

36:25.164 --> 36:27.331
Uh, I...

36:38.376 --> 36:40.878
It's funny how your mind
can play tricks on you

36:40.880 --> 36:43.080
when your life's on the line.

36:53.226 --> 36:55.025
Police!

36:55.027 --> 36:58.028
Open up!

36:58.030 --> 37:00.030
Detective, what is going on?

37:00.032 --> 37:01.832
We need to speak to David,
ma'am.

37:01.834 --> 37:03.300
Now.

37:03.302 --> 37:05.269
Uh, yes, please.

37:09.374 --> 37:10.975
David?

37:10.977 --> 37:12.476
Why? What is happening?

37:12.478 --> 37:13.944
Father, what's...

37:15.947 --> 37:18.182
Don't move, David.
We need to talk to you.

37:20.318 --> 37:21.652
Stay back!

37:21.654 --> 37:22.820
David, stop.

37:22.822 --> 37:24.388
Listen to me.
Put the knife down.

37:25.190 --> 37:26.257
What is the meaning of this?

37:26.259 --> 37:27.591
You put that knife down
right this minute!

37:27.593 --> 37:29.193
Put the knife down!
Listen to your father,

37:29.195 --> 37:30.995
David!
Shut up!

37:30.997 --> 37:33.030
Get 'em out of here, Baez.

37:33.032 --> 37:34.498
We need to step outside.
This is my house.

37:34.500 --> 37:36.367
Shut up!
Let's go!

37:36.369 --> 37:37.568
Outside!

37:38.603 --> 37:40.704
I know you're in a lot of pain.

37:40.706 --> 37:42.506
But this isn't gonna make it
any better.

37:42.508 --> 37:44.108
It's only gonna make it worse.

37:44.110 --> 37:45.876
Look, I never meant to hurt Amy.

37:45.878 --> 37:47.311
I loved her.

37:47.313 --> 37:49.180
I just wanted to help her,
you know?

37:49.182 --> 37:50.514
I just wanted to save her.

37:50.516 --> 37:53.350
You were afraid of what
your father was gonna do, right?

37:53.352 --> 37:54.718
I did everything
I could.

37:54.720 --> 37:56.387
All it did was...

37:56.389 --> 37:58.255
I drove her to those tracks.

37:58.257 --> 38:00.391
No. No,
you didn't.

38:00.393 --> 38:02.259
You just tried to help.

38:03.996 --> 38:05.095
Don't do this.

38:05.097 --> 38:06.297
My father would've wanted it
this way.

38:06.299 --> 38:08.666
No, he would not.
Listen to me.

38:08.668 --> 38:11.435
Listen to me.
I lost a brother, too.

38:12.971 --> 38:15.172
And I blame myself for it
all the time.

38:15.174 --> 38:18.309
All the time.

38:18.311 --> 38:20.744
The only thing that hurts worse
than the pain I feel

38:20.746 --> 38:23.614
is the pain I see in my
father's eyes every single day.

38:23.616 --> 38:26.116
There's only one thing
that can make that pain

38:26.118 --> 38:28.686
go away.

38:28.688 --> 38:30.287
That's his other children.

38:30.289 --> 38:32.323
That's us. That's me and you.

38:32.325 --> 38:34.925
You're in
that boat now.

38:34.927 --> 38:36.660
Just like me.

38:36.662 --> 38:39.230
So why don't you come on
and put that knife down?

38:39.232 --> 38:43.200
Will you tell my parents
I love them.

38:45.271 --> 38:46.303
Drop it.

38:47.906 --> 38:49.873
No. No!

38:51.744 --> 38:53.711
No!

38:53.713 --> 38:55.779
Amy. No!
It's all right.

39:00.919 --> 39:02.519
"Give me your tired, your poor,

39:02.521 --> 39:04.989
"Your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free,

39:04.991 --> 39:07.524
"The wretched refuse
of your teeming shore.

39:07.526 --> 39:09.226
"Send these, the homeless,
tempest-tost

39:09.228 --> 39:11.962
To me, I lift my lamp
beside the golden door."

39:11.964 --> 39:14.431
That was
really good, Jack.

39:14.433 --> 39:16.000
Yep. Proud of you, kid.

39:16.002 --> 39:19.336
Now you two go pay your respects
at the World War II Memorial.

39:19.338 --> 39:21.605
You got to memorize
every name up there.

39:21.607 --> 39:23.507
What?
Seriously?

39:23.509 --> 39:26.477
I'm kidding. Go.

39:28.546 --> 39:30.614
Thanks for taking the
day off to be with us.

39:30.616 --> 39:33.050
You know, it means a lot.
Yeah.

39:33.052 --> 39:34.451
It's funny how it works.

39:34.453 --> 39:36.854
These are the days the boys
will remember the most.

39:36.856 --> 39:38.289
Yep.

39:39.891 --> 39:41.859
Something bothering you?

39:41.861 --> 39:43.961
Scored a tough case at work.

39:43.963 --> 39:46.964
Want to talk about it?

39:51.202 --> 39:53.037
We're lucky, you know.

39:53.039 --> 39:55.239
I know.

39:57.809 --> 40:00.511
I really do.

40:00.513 --> 40:02.012
Good afternoon.

40:02.014 --> 40:05.382
I've asked Police Commissioner
Reagan to stand with me today

40:05.384 --> 40:07.785
because the report
you have just been handed

40:07.787 --> 40:10.788
reflects our shared opinion.

40:10.790 --> 40:12.256
Commissioner.

40:12.258 --> 40:14.825
After careful review

40:14.827 --> 40:16.026
of all the evidence,

40:16.028 --> 40:19.496
the inspector general
and I agree that

40:19.498 --> 40:21.732
Officer Edit Janko

40:21.734 --> 40:25.269
shall remain
a New York City police officer.

40:25.271 --> 40:28.305
It is the opinion of my office

40:28.307 --> 40:31.408
that Officer Janko
exercised good judgment

40:31.410 --> 40:34.378
and responsible procedure
in this matter

40:34.380 --> 40:38.015
within the latitude we'd allow
any officer of the peace

40:38.017 --> 40:41.518
under such extraordinarily
dangerous conditions.

40:41.520 --> 40:44.221
And I'd like to thank
Commissioner Reagan

40:44.223 --> 40:45.723
for his cooperation

40:45.725 --> 40:47.891
and his acumen.

40:48.793 --> 40:51.362
Thank you, Ms. Peterson.

40:51.364 --> 40:53.330
While the
inspector general

40:53.332 --> 40:56.633
and I are in complete agreement
about Officer Janko,

40:56.635 --> 41:00.938
there is some blame
to go around here,

41:00.940 --> 41:03.440
and it falls on me.

41:03.442 --> 41:07.978
It is my job to make sure
our officers are trained

41:07.980 --> 41:11.081
for any and all situations.

41:11.083 --> 41:12.549
In this case,

41:12.551 --> 41:15.052
our training failed
Officer Janko.

41:15.054 --> 41:16.353
So I am ordering

41:16.355 --> 41:18.622
additional
training

41:18.624 --> 41:21.058
for all probationary officers.

41:21.060 --> 41:22.292
Thank you for your time.

41:22.294 --> 41:23.460
Commissioner, sir!
Commissioner Reagan!

41:23.462 --> 41:25.062
Commissioner,
does this mean

41:25.064 --> 41:27.765
you now support the position
of Inspector General?

41:28.867 --> 41:30.200
Yes.

41:30.202 --> 41:31.802
Today.

41:31.804 --> 41:34.505
At this press conference.

41:34.507 --> 41:37.274
On this matter.
