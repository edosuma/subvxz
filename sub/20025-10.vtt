WEBVTT

00:01.234 --> 00:01.434
.

00:07.607 --> 00:12.112
Six years ago, the Geordie squad
first got together.

00:15.648 --> 00:18.585
But it's not all been one big party.
Back to work.

00:19.586 --> 00:22.288
Gotta work
for that wrinkly fuck, Anna.

00:23.189 --> 00:26.626
But we fucking nailed it.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.695
# Any cock's good
When it's cock, cock, cock #

00:31.131 --> 00:34.067
We only gone and made her business
a global success.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.505
So, now, the squad is expanding.

00:38.571 --> 00:40.974
Oy, oy.
Hello!

00:41.040 --> 00:42.876
Hiya!
(all cheer)

00:49.482 --> 00:52.419
I'm not gonna be able
to keep yous all on full-time.

00:52.485 --> 00:57.857
We need to help Anna decide
who stays... and who goes.

00:57.924 --> 01:00.059
(cheering)

01:00.126 --> 01:02.429
The only thing
we give a shit about is...

01:02.495 --> 01:05.165
Are they fucking radge enough?

01:05.230 --> 01:07.967
To join this crazy family?

01:14.007 --> 01:15.642
Let wuh fucking gan.

01:18.077 --> 01:21.614
Everyone's expecting us to care,
but the truth is, I don't.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.917
Me and Aaron are friends
and I'm happy.

01:27.854 --> 01:31.858
Abbie's saying that I didn't tell
her I liked Scott from the start.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.059
I kissed him first.

01:33.126 --> 01:35.762
(Anna) "I booked you a flight
to Newcastle."

01:35.829 --> 01:38.264
I do not wanna go back to Newcastle.

01:41.668 --> 01:44.604
This is the first time
me and Chloe have been just pals.

01:44.671 --> 01:47.240
We're in a good place.
I don't want it to change.

01:47.307 --> 01:48.808
I might try to bang Zahida.

01:48.875 --> 01:52.078
I think it's more fun
to try and graft every newbie.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.949
What the fuck have I just seen?
Scott and Zahida have just kissed.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.589
(whispers) Oh, God. It's so hard!

02:06.392 --> 02:08.627
I should have a degree
in pulling women.

02:08.695 --> 02:10.930
I'd never kiss anyone
without a six-pack.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.700
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

02:13.766 --> 02:16.135
Get me in,
cos I'm gonna tear the place up.

02:16.202 --> 02:18.238
I'm preened to perfection.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.640
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

02:20.707 --> 02:23.476
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

02:23.543 --> 02:26.446
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.782
My quiff's pure lethal
and me banter's pure naughty.

02:29.849 --> 02:32.252
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:43.229 --> 02:46.399
I'm so fucking tired.
Fuck off.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.767
Are you getting in?

02:48.868 --> 02:52.105
It's our final days in Tignes,
and I swear I'm still drunk.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.973
I don't remember much,

02:54.040 --> 02:56.676
but I know I heard it
kicking off last night.

02:58.645 --> 03:00.947
Zahida's apparently kissed Scott.

03:01.014 --> 03:04.384
Last night, Aaron reckons
he's seen Scott and Zahida kiss.

03:04.450 --> 03:08.621
No one knows what's happened,
but I know that Aaron never lies.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.457
I don't know if it would've happened

03:11.524 --> 03:15.328
because Zahida does stick up
for Sarah all the time,

03:15.395 --> 03:19.365
and I don't know if she'd be
that stupid to neck on with Scott.

03:19.432 --> 03:22.569
I don't know what to believe.
Did they? Didn't they?

03:22.635 --> 03:26.005
I know Scott's stupid,
but he's not that stupid.

03:26.072 --> 03:27.440
Zahida's got a lad.

03:31.010 --> 03:32.879
What happened when yous got back?

03:32.946 --> 03:35.415
I'm sure the oven got pure braid.

03:35.481 --> 03:37.617
Oh, mate, fuck knows.

03:37.684 --> 03:40.787
Not much happened apart from
me necking on with Zahida.

03:40.853 --> 03:43.056
I think that's called
a Newbie full house.

03:43.122 --> 03:44.324
But the game isn't won

03:44.390 --> 03:47.193
until I've given them all
the royal fucking flush.

03:57.804 --> 04:01.708
I'm sitting there, right? Pissed.
I don't think Scott realised.

04:01.774 --> 04:06.579
Scott and Zahida are crouched down
and all of a sudden they kissed.

04:06.646 --> 04:09.882
I know what I saw last night.
Zahida and Scott necked on.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.518
I don't know what's going on
in that kid's head.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.988
If he's not careful,
he's gonna get burned.

04:16.555 --> 04:18.625
(sighs) He just wants every bird.

04:18.690 --> 04:22.662
I know Scott. This is him all over.
He loves living life on the edge,

04:22.729 --> 04:27.066
and he's keeping his options open.
He will never change.

04:27.133 --> 04:29.902
Oh, the thing is,
he's gotta think as well,

04:29.969 --> 04:32.805
Abbie and Sarah and Zahida
are three newbies.

04:32.872 --> 04:35.575
He could be grafting Abbie,
get back to Newcastle,

04:35.642 --> 04:37.744
and it'd be like,
Abbie didn't make it.

04:41.414 --> 04:44.050
So ill.
I'm pissed off.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.251
What about?

04:45.318 --> 04:47.320
Aaron. "Oh, yous two are necking on."

04:47.387 --> 04:50.523
What the fuck? I can't believe
I kissed Scott last night.

04:50.590 --> 04:52.659
I've got a boyfriend.

04:52.725 --> 04:55.294
All I can do is deny this, full stop.

04:55.361 --> 04:57.330
I don't know if you kissed
on the lips.

04:57.397 --> 05:00.266
He kissed me on the cheek.
But it was definitely...

05:00.333 --> 05:01.768
I heard a... (kisses)

05:01.834 --> 05:04.604
I wouldn't neck on with Nathan,
never mind Scott.

05:04.671 --> 05:06.773
I know what I heard
and I know what I saw.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.410
Next she'll pretend that she tripped
and fell on Scotty's lips.

05:10.476 --> 05:15.748
It's fucking outrageous. I'd never
do that anyway. You're my best mate.

05:15.815 --> 05:17.517
Yeah, I don't get why he said it.

05:17.583 --> 05:19.585
Zahida is my best mate.

05:19.652 --> 05:23.289
She's got a boyfriend
and she knows how much I like Scott.

05:23.356 --> 05:27.060
I'm not ready to accept that my best
friend would stab me in the back,

05:27.126 --> 05:28.561
like that snake, Abbie.

05:28.628 --> 05:31.597
Right, OK, let's get ready.

05:31.664 --> 05:33.132
Sort shit out.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.708
I'm excited to be going back home,
but Anna has said

05:41.774 --> 05:44.944
not everyone's gonna be staying on
when we get to Newcastle.

05:45.011 --> 05:47.647
We don't know how many people
are going, or when.

05:49.415 --> 05:51.584
Back to Newcastle!
Thank you!

05:51.651 --> 05:53.419
Oh, fucking (indistinct).

05:53.486 --> 05:57.557
After that drama with me and Zahida,
I managed to get away scot-free.

05:57.623 --> 06:00.226
I've now got one, two, three
newbie birds

06:00.293 --> 06:02.161
all eating out of my hand.

06:02.228 --> 06:04.564
I just hope I don't run out
of fucking seeds.

06:09.469 --> 06:13.306
Tignes,
you have been absolutely amazing.

06:13.372 --> 06:16.442
You learnt us how to ski,
but I'm never coming back.

06:16.509 --> 06:19.879
So fuck off, and hello, Newcastle!

06:22.915 --> 06:25.118
Yay! Back home!

06:25.184 --> 06:26.552
Yeah!

06:31.023 --> 06:32.925
Haven't been here in a while, like!

06:32.992 --> 06:34.694
Get ready and get pissed!

06:34.761 --> 06:36.963
After all the drama in Tignes,

06:37.029 --> 06:39.866
we're back in Newcastle
on our home turf,

06:39.932 --> 06:42.969
so that means one thing
and one thing only.

06:43.035 --> 06:44.904
Let's get mortal!

06:53.479 --> 06:57.183
We're smashing out some cocktails
ready for our first night back.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.885
And I hope, for all our sakes,

06:58.951 --> 07:02.121
we've left all the drama of Tignes
on the slopes.

07:02.188 --> 07:05.525
Think things got a bit
out of control.

07:05.591 --> 07:08.327
I just got upset
because everyone was like,

07:08.394 --> 07:10.229
"Scott's flirting with Zahida."

07:10.296 --> 07:13.566
I felt like everyone
turned against us, so I walked off.

07:13.633 --> 07:16.002
For now, I think everyone believes

07:16.068 --> 07:18.404
that nothing happened
with me and Scott.

07:18.471 --> 07:21.541
I need to keep away from him
and not let it happen again.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.543
But I am you pal. He wouldn't...

07:23.609 --> 07:25.044
I'm your best mate.
I know.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.679
I wouldn't do that.

07:26.746 --> 07:30.416
I'm willing to drop this Scott thing
and take Zahida's word for it.

07:30.483 --> 07:33.386
Cos at the end of the day,
she's my best friend.

07:33.452 --> 07:36.022
And there's no way
she would ever lie to us.

07:36.088 --> 07:39.525
Any little thing that you do in
this house, it's over exaggerated.

07:39.592 --> 07:43.329
As soon as you do anything,
everyone knows about it.

07:43.396 --> 07:45.998
Can't exaggerate that 69, though,
can you?

07:46.065 --> 07:48.367
Whoa!

07:48.434 --> 07:50.303
Who's put 20p in you?

07:50.369 --> 07:53.840
Sarah is still making
slaggy comments about me and Scott.

07:53.906 --> 07:56.976
Yes, Sarah, it was me in that bed,
not you,

07:57.043 --> 07:59.545
so make your cocktail
and get over it.

08:02.715 --> 08:05.818
Are you still gonna try
and bang Abbie, or...

08:05.885 --> 08:09.989
You know what it is, fuck me,
I haven't even thought about it.

08:11.724 --> 08:15.261
It's gonna be horrible
because Newcastle's my playground.

08:15.328 --> 08:17.396
What about Zahida, though?

08:17.463 --> 08:20.333
Scott, I can tell you,
you need to be careful.

08:20.399 --> 08:24.437
You're playing with fire and
you are blatantly gonna get burnt.

08:24.503 --> 08:29.408
If I seen Abbie and Sarah on a night
out, like, if I was on the piss,

08:29.475 --> 08:31.878
I'd think, "Who do I pick?"
I'd picked Abbie.

08:31.944 --> 08:36.015
I know Scott's all mouth.
He's saying one thing to the lads

08:36.082 --> 08:38.551
and one thing to the lasses.
He's full of shit.

08:40.318 --> 08:43.823
The journey was that long
from Tignes, I need to fucking shave.

08:43.890 --> 08:45.491
So I got wuh awesome presents.

08:47.226 --> 08:48.327
Oh.

08:48.394 --> 08:50.596
It's a fucking razor.
The cheeky bitch.

08:50.663 --> 08:53.165
She's the wolf, not me.

08:53.232 --> 08:56.602
I'll be shaving your Wolverine
sideburns in a minute with that.

08:56.669 --> 08:59.305
Now shut the fuck up.
Let me shave your bum hole.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.439
(laughs)

09:00.506 --> 09:03.576
Yous should be very grateful
Chloe's bought you a gift.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.411
In all the years I've know her,

09:05.478 --> 09:07.680
she's never even gave me
a fucking penny.

09:07.747 --> 09:08.948
The hair...

09:09.015 --> 09:11.817
(gasps) You just cut my clit off.

09:11.884 --> 09:14.120
Go on, fuck off!
Well, you picked them!

09:14.186 --> 09:18.157
Sophie showed me her clit before
and I still feel sick about it.

09:18.224 --> 09:19.725
Sophie's got a nice clit.

09:19.792 --> 09:21.861
I don't know about these girls,

09:21.928 --> 09:24.997
but I'm learning far too much
about vaginas.

09:25.064 --> 09:26.766
Haven't you, Soph?

09:29.535 --> 09:30.970
Which one's the clit?

09:31.037 --> 09:33.940
I don't know what's in the air
being back in Newcastle,

09:34.006 --> 09:38.010
but for some reason, we have all
got to show each other our vaginas.

09:38.077 --> 09:40.413
What happens
if I put something up it?

09:40.479 --> 09:42.214
(laughs)

09:43.149 --> 09:45.451
You wouldn't dare.
You wouldn't dare.

09:45.518 --> 09:48.454
(screams) Oh, my God!

09:48.521 --> 09:51.223
Oh, my days!
Did that feel nice?

09:51.290 --> 09:53.893
I'm gonna have nightmares for weeks.

09:53.960 --> 09:57.763
To the best friends that anyone
could have! Awesome foursome!

09:57.830 --> 10:01.400
(all chant) Awesome foursome!
Awesome foursome!

10:04.070 --> 10:06.772
I think the uncertainty
of when we're going

10:06.839 --> 10:10.343
just means that this is our night
to have as much fun as possible.

10:10.409 --> 10:13.412
We just need to make sure
that we have a wicked night.

10:13.479 --> 10:14.580
I know.

10:14.647 --> 10:16.882
We're excited, but we're nervous.

10:16.949 --> 10:19.652
We still don't know
when someone's gonna be going.

10:19.719 --> 10:22.021
No work tonight, just getting pissed.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.424
Yeah, first night as well.
No arguments. Let's all have fun.

10:28.527 --> 10:29.996
Whoo!

10:31.931 --> 10:34.000
Hey!

10:35.401 --> 10:38.738
It's the first night back,
and we're going to Powerhouse,

10:38.804 --> 10:42.942
and I cannot wait to get
m-m-m-m-m-mortal!

10:43.009 --> 10:46.012
(all cheer)

10:46.078 --> 10:48.080
A real flower!

10:48.147 --> 10:50.049
(laughs)

10:50.116 --> 10:53.219
I'm ready for our first night
back in Newcastle.

10:53.285 --> 10:54.653
Fucking jump in!

10:54.720 --> 10:57.456
(all shouting)

10:57.523 --> 11:00.259
I feel like tonight
is all about the vaginas.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.794
(all cheer)

11:03.596 --> 11:06.465
Tonight is gonna go fucking off.

11:06.532 --> 11:09.902
I thought it'd be funny, not sexual.

11:09.969 --> 11:12.705
Scott's giving us attention
and I like it.

11:12.772 --> 11:15.574
I'm not a fucking option!
I'm not a one or two!

11:15.641 --> 11:17.810
The truth will come out.

11:17.877 --> 11:19.078
(all shouting)

11:19.145 --> 11:21.947
This is the worst mistake
I've ever made.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.282
(both chuckle)

11:23.349 --> 11:25.418
I'm innocent till proven guilty.

11:25.484 --> 11:27.386
Oh, good God.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.688
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:33.092 --> 11:33.192
.

11:35.728 --> 11:35.928
.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.337
It's our first night
back in Newcastle,

11:45.404 --> 11:47.773
and everyone is feeling
so much better.

11:47.840 --> 11:51.010
Tonight is gonna go fucking off.

11:56.816 --> 11:58.284
(all cheer)

12:06.425 --> 12:08.427
Time is running out for the newbies.

12:08.494 --> 12:10.663
Me and Sophie came up
with an initiation

12:10.729 --> 12:13.899
to see how much
they want this position.

12:13.966 --> 12:18.904
Right, so what you're gonna do
is one last brutal initiation.

12:18.971 --> 12:22.975
This initiation is the ultimate
challenge, the worst one yet.

12:23.042 --> 12:25.244
I feel sick thinking about it.

12:25.311 --> 12:29.381
We wanna see who of you
does the best blowjob

12:29.448 --> 12:31.617
you can give her toe.

12:31.684 --> 12:35.254
It's time for my toe
to finally get a wash.

12:35.321 --> 12:36.622
Get in, son.

12:36.689 --> 12:38.491
Let's do a countdown.
Nine...

12:38.557 --> 12:40.326
I can't think of anything worse.

12:40.392 --> 12:42.061
For one, I hate feet.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.598
And for two, I know for a fine fact
that Chloe doesn't wash.

12:50.002 --> 12:52.738
Sarah is taking it so seriously.

12:52.805 --> 12:55.574
I thought it'd be funny, not sexual.

12:58.644 --> 13:03.082
I cannot believe
I'm actually sucking on Chloe's toe.

13:03.149 --> 13:05.718
Five, four, three,

13:05.784 --> 13:08.854
two, one... Go on, Abbie!

13:08.921 --> 13:11.490
Fuck me.
This is the ultimate challenge.

13:11.557 --> 13:13.826
I'm gonna spew
just thinking about it.

13:13.893 --> 13:15.728
(shouting)

13:17.863 --> 13:21.800
This is grim, but a man's gotta do
what a man's gotta do.

13:21.867 --> 13:24.637
Three, two, one...

13:24.703 --> 13:27.606
My toe is getting so turned on.

13:27.673 --> 13:29.375
I feel it's got a clit.

13:35.848 --> 13:38.184
Fuck me,
Zahida's got some all right moves.

13:38.250 --> 13:39.785
My pipe is pure kicking off.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.261
I hate feet, and Chloe's are lifting.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.665
This initiation is bringing out
the competitive side in us.

13:52.731 --> 13:54.567
It's just as well I'm mortal.

13:58.571 --> 14:01.540
I think the winner has to be Zahida,

14:01.607 --> 14:04.743
because she was very experimental...

14:04.810 --> 14:06.779
Experimental with my toe.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.814
Zahida!

14:16.355 --> 14:20.226
My first night back in Newcastle
has been amazing so far.

14:20.292 --> 14:23.162
The tension from last night
has blown over,

14:23.229 --> 14:25.064
which is a massive relief.

14:25.130 --> 14:27.066
Let's get fucking mortal.

14:34.073 --> 14:36.208
One minute, Scott's in my bed.

14:36.275 --> 14:39.345
Next there's rumours
that he's necking on with Zahida.

14:39.411 --> 14:43.415
What the fuck is he playing at?
I need to find out what is going on.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.698
I've got my work cut out for us
here. Abbie is going berserk.

14:59.765 --> 15:03.068
This is gonna be more complicated
than I originally thought,

15:03.135 --> 15:05.304
but Scotty T
will always pull through,

15:05.371 --> 15:07.606
because this dickhead
is a professional.

15:12.344 --> 15:16.015
Now that I've given Abbie some sweet
talk, I'll check up on the others.

15:16.081 --> 15:18.517
Zahida, where are you,
you fucking rascal?

15:25.224 --> 15:28.294
Oh, my God, I've never seen
Zahida act like this.

15:28.360 --> 15:29.895
She's on one tonight.

15:29.962 --> 15:34.066
If this is the real Zahida, then
maybe it's true about her and Scott.

15:47.112 --> 15:49.882
Zahida's pretending
she's not interested.

15:49.948 --> 15:52.584
But she knows that she can
only pretend for so long

15:52.651 --> 15:54.486
before she gives in to my schlong.

15:57.690 --> 16:01.126
Scott's giving us attention
and I'm starting to like it.

16:01.193 --> 16:02.328
I must be fucked.

16:07.366 --> 16:09.268
I'm having a pure frisk tonight,

16:09.335 --> 16:12.137
but Zahida needs to get me in a taxi
before I get FOMOC,

16:12.204 --> 16:15.407
Fear Of Missing Out on Cuddles.

16:15.474 --> 16:17.543
Go, go, go.
Run away.

16:17.609 --> 16:19.845
Listen, I've had a good night.
Have you?

16:19.912 --> 16:21.613
Yeah, spit in my mouth.

16:21.680 --> 16:23.015
Eh? Spit in your mouth?

16:23.082 --> 16:26.418
That's what you need to do.
Don't knock it till you try it.

16:26.485 --> 16:27.519
(spits)

16:27.586 --> 16:28.921
(laughs)

16:35.694 --> 16:36.729
Oh, good God!

16:36.795 --> 16:38.564
What have we done tonight?

16:39.565 --> 16:41.567
(kissing)

16:45.270 --> 16:47.206
I don't know how this is happening,

16:47.272 --> 16:49.641
but Scott's working
some kind of charm on us,

16:49.708 --> 16:52.144
and in a weird way, it's working.

16:52.211 --> 16:55.047
I know this is wrong,
but I can't help it.

16:55.114 --> 16:56.815
(laughs)

17:09.528 --> 17:12.731
This time round,
me and Marty are being so good.

17:12.798 --> 17:14.633
I don't want anything to ruin that.

17:17.636 --> 17:21.106
Chloe and me have a good friendship.
I never wanna fuck this up.

17:21.173 --> 17:22.441
Cos I love her so much.

17:33.685 --> 17:38.023
What the fuck? It looks like Scott
and Zahida have left the club early.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.359
After the rumour
that went on last night,

17:40.426 --> 17:44.530
I thought Zahida, out of everyone,
would've stayed away.

17:44.596 --> 17:47.266
Get me out of this club
and back to the house.

17:47.332 --> 17:49.435
Let's go home! Come on!

18:00.145 --> 18:02.080
Damn!
Damn!

18:12.090 --> 18:15.527
There's no way they'll believe
I just went back for a casual chat,

18:15.594 --> 18:18.063
but unless they catch me
balls deep in her,

18:18.130 --> 18:20.466
I'm innocent till proven
fucking guilty.

18:29.808 --> 18:31.877
Oh! Where's your missus?

18:31.944 --> 18:34.146
(indistinct)

18:34.213 --> 18:35.948
Where's your missus?

18:37.049 --> 18:38.283
Oh!
Oh!

18:38.350 --> 18:40.252
Hey, shagger!

18:40.319 --> 18:41.653
How's your fanny?

18:41.720 --> 18:43.856
No, I have my night out
clothes on still.

18:43.922 --> 18:46.258
Everyone's come back
from the club early.

18:46.325 --> 18:48.927
There's no way
I'm getting away with this twice,

18:48.994 --> 18:51.163
and there's no chance
I can own up to this.

18:51.230 --> 18:52.731
What's it got to do with you?

18:52.798 --> 18:55.701
Why? Cos I'm the voice of reason.

18:55.767 --> 18:59.438
There's no way that nothing happened
in Tignes with Scott and Zahida.

18:59.505 --> 19:01.173
They 100% kissed.

19:01.240 --> 19:04.743
There's something going on.
Why else would they leave the club?

19:04.810 --> 19:06.445
Tell me why you left.

19:06.512 --> 19:09.281
I didn't leave with him.
I left on my own.

19:09.348 --> 19:12.117
So far, I've held it in,

19:12.184 --> 19:16.822
but now Marnie's brought all this
into the open, I am gonna kick off.

19:16.889 --> 19:19.424
Scott, I told you that I liked you!

19:19.491 --> 19:21.527
I am out! Out! I'm out!

19:21.593 --> 19:24.329
Because I'm not an option!

19:24.396 --> 19:27.366
I'm not a fucking option!
I'm not a one or a two!

19:27.432 --> 19:30.168
Fucking hell. Stop screaming.
Listen...

19:30.235 --> 19:31.570
Sarah...

19:31.637 --> 19:34.907
Honestly, I'm not a fucking option!

19:34.973 --> 19:38.744
Maybe it wasn't a good idea going
with Zahida. It's all kicking off.

19:38.810 --> 19:43.015
When a girl's saying "let's go",
what am I supposed to do? Say no?

19:45.484 --> 19:47.719
The girls need to realise
that I'm a rascal

19:47.786 --> 19:49.721
who likes to live life
in the moment.

19:49.788 --> 19:53.492
They should stop kicking off
and learn to be spontaneous like me.

19:53.559 --> 19:55.761
Zahida,
you've got a fucking boyfriend.

19:55.827 --> 19:57.729
You've got a boyfriend.

19:57.796 --> 20:01.600
I don't know why, all of a sudden,
everyone's just assumed I'm a slag.

20:01.667 --> 20:05.003
I haven't slept with Scott,
and I can say that for a fact.

20:05.070 --> 20:08.540
Tell me one reason
why you would leave with Scott.

20:08.607 --> 20:10.642
I left on my own accord.

20:10.709 --> 20:13.278
Everything's just got
a little too out of hand.

20:13.345 --> 20:16.248
And we don't even know
what the fuck happened.

20:18.317 --> 20:20.018
Marnie, fuck off!

20:20.085 --> 20:22.988
(all shouting)

20:24.623 --> 20:26.091
Me and Zahida are arguing

20:26.158 --> 20:29.528
and that bitch is trying to get
physical when she's in the wrong.

20:29.595 --> 20:33.398
She's fucking over mates. She needs
to have a word with herself.

20:33.465 --> 20:36.134
(all shouting)

20:40.305 --> 20:43.041
Zahida, if you're telling the truth,
that's fine.

20:43.108 --> 20:46.244
But the truth will come out
and you will get found out.

20:57.155 --> 20:59.257
I'm going to bed. I'm going to bed.

20:59.324 --> 21:00.892
Are you coming, Sarah?

21:00.959 --> 21:03.228
There's no way Sarah
can stay with Zahida

21:03.295 --> 21:05.297
when Zahida stabbed her in the back.

21:05.364 --> 21:07.733
We think she has.
She's gonna stay with me.

21:07.799 --> 21:10.869
She thinks because nothing happened
that it's OK.

21:10.936 --> 21:13.605
It's not OK. You can't do that.
Never.

21:13.672 --> 21:17.376
Zahida has never went
behind my back before with a boy

21:17.442 --> 21:19.077
the way she has with Scott.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.912
I feel so betrayed.

21:27.052 --> 21:29.821
This is the worst mistake
I've ever made.

21:29.888 --> 21:33.158
I've betrayed my best friend
and my boyfriend.

21:33.225 --> 21:36.695
And I'm petrified that everyone's
gonna find out the truth.

21:36.762 --> 21:39.831
I didn't think I would betray
two people at once.

21:42.668 --> 21:44.569
Why did you leave together?

21:44.636 --> 21:45.971
I haven't done fuck all.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.741
This nightmare is not going away,
and the guilt is getting too much.

21:49.808 --> 21:51.276
Hey!

21:51.343 --> 21:52.944
Shit's just got real.

21:53.011 --> 21:56.882
But now, I only want
the three best workers.

21:56.948 --> 21:58.684
Someone's definitely going.

22:00.352 --> 22:02.187
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:05.524 --> 22:05.724
.

22:08.193 --> 22:08.393
.

22:24.576 --> 22:27.245
I've woken up
and I'm still in this nightmare.

22:27.312 --> 22:29.848
I've ruined my friendship
with Abbie and Sarah.

22:29.915 --> 22:32.918
And worst of all,
I've cheated on my boyfriend.

22:32.984 --> 22:35.587
I can't wait for this day
to be over with already.

22:38.156 --> 22:41.893
Question I wanna know, why the fuck
did you get in Zahida's taxi?

22:41.960 --> 22:45.397
Mate, I... Cos I wanted to get home.

22:45.464 --> 22:47.099
So, I jumped in Zahida's taxi.

22:47.165 --> 22:48.533
You tried it on with her?

22:53.105 --> 22:55.540
I'm telling the lads
I didn't get with Zahida.

22:55.607 --> 22:58.076
Little do they know
it's national opposite day

22:58.143 --> 23:00.445
and I definitely,
definitely fucking did.

23:00.512 --> 23:03.448
I wonder if Anna's gonna ring soon.

23:05.150 --> 23:06.485
(laughs) What a shock!

23:06.551 --> 23:08.053
No, cos she's...

23:08.120 --> 23:11.857
I felt bad last night, cos everyone
was jumping to conclusions.

23:11.923 --> 23:14.659
You felt bad?
You should have had her back then.

23:14.726 --> 23:18.797
This is the second night there's
been rumours about Scott and Zahida.

23:18.864 --> 23:20.899
No one knows exactly what's going on,

23:20.966 --> 23:24.736
but if it's gotta do with Scott,
I can guarantee there's some truth.

23:24.803 --> 23:27.105
Boys, you want tea, or coffee?

23:27.172 --> 23:28.440
Tea, mate.
Tea, mate.

23:31.643 --> 23:33.011
Morning.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.247
I can't even be alive today.

23:35.313 --> 23:36.882
(burps)
Hi, Sarah.

23:36.948 --> 23:37.983
Hello.

23:38.049 --> 23:40.418
How do you feel about waking up
in this room?

23:40.485 --> 23:44.523
Last night's very hazy, but
I remember being very fucked off.

23:45.557 --> 23:49.561
Last night, Zahida left the club
early and went home with Scott.

23:49.628 --> 23:53.098
Even thought Scott has been chasing
both Scott and Abbie.

23:53.165 --> 23:57.335
What makes matters worse is,
Sarah and Zahida are best friends.

23:57.402 --> 24:00.572
Listen, Sarah,
last night I was very proud of you.

24:00.639 --> 24:05.844
I kept saying, "You need a backbone.
You need to tell lads how you feel."

24:05.911 --> 24:08.446
Last night when I seen you,
you were going mad.

24:08.513 --> 24:10.081
You were going in.
I loved it.

24:10.148 --> 24:12.584
So proud of you.
I think you're in the right.

24:12.651 --> 24:17.088
I don't get why Zahida and Scott
felt the need to leave together.

24:17.155 --> 24:19.558
Right, yous,
I'm gonna have to head back down.

24:19.624 --> 24:20.725
OK.

24:20.792 --> 24:22.661
I've known Zahida for a long time.

24:22.727 --> 24:25.096
Sometimes she does bend the truth.

24:25.163 --> 24:28.667
I think getting an honest
explanation is gonna be difficult.

24:28.733 --> 24:30.702
Walk of shame.
Dirty stop out!

24:30.769 --> 24:32.971
Sarah's doing the walk of shame.

24:35.841 --> 24:36.908
Morning.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.610
Morning.

24:40.078 --> 24:42.948
I've woke up with the mother
of all hangovers

24:43.014 --> 24:46.284
and I'm sure I can still taste
Chloe's nail varnish in my mouth.

24:46.351 --> 24:48.119
This is not a good start to the day.

24:49.287 --> 24:50.722
Sarah.

24:50.789 --> 24:54.059
Hello.
How's tings?

24:54.125 --> 24:56.127
Never better. (laughs)

24:56.194 --> 24:59.798
Where did you stay last night?
Upstairs in the girls' room.

24:59.865 --> 25:03.301
This is awkward.
I wasn't ready to see Sarah so soon.

25:03.368 --> 25:06.738
And I'm not ready to admit
what happened in the taxi

25:06.805 --> 25:08.773
when me and Scott
left the club early.

25:08.840 --> 25:13.378
Zahida, last night, you would be
annoyed at me for doing that.

25:13.445 --> 25:15.480
Going in the taxi first?

25:15.547 --> 25:18.450
I was fucked off. I don't know
why you left together.

25:18.516 --> 25:22.721
I haven't done fuck all. I literally
left early cos I couldn't be assed.

25:22.787 --> 25:25.891
I was so drunk.
This is typical Zahida.

25:25.957 --> 25:29.561
She's trying to wriggle her way out,
she won't take responsibility.

25:29.628 --> 25:32.197
She made herself the victim
in this situation.

25:33.598 --> 25:36.368
I thought you believed
everything they were saying

25:36.434 --> 25:39.971
so I didn't know how to be like,
I wanna talk to Sarah now.

25:40.038 --> 25:43.909
I'm talking to Abbie and Sarah
and I'm lying to their faces.

25:43.975 --> 25:47.412
I can't bring myself
to tell them what I've done.

25:47.479 --> 25:51.082
This nightmare is not going away
and the guilt is getting too much.

25:51.149 --> 25:54.719
At the end of the day,
I just want to say one thing,

25:54.786 --> 25:58.490
I feel like shit this morning
and I'm sick to death of it.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.892
I can't be assed
to be in the fucking middle.

26:00.959 --> 26:04.462
You're sick of being in the middle?
No one put you there.

26:04.529 --> 26:07.899
You jumped in a cab with Scott
and jumped straight to the middle.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.267
Fucking doyle.

26:09.334 --> 26:11.169
I'm totally sick of my life.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.407
I don't know what to do
at this point.

26:15.473 --> 26:18.443
I don't think I can tell anyone yet
until I speak to Scott.

26:18.510 --> 26:21.313
They're not gonna wanna live
with that much drama.

26:23.048 --> 26:26.017
I hope Anna doesn't get wind
of the kick-offs last night.

26:26.084 --> 26:28.219
Otherwise she could send
all of wuh home.

26:28.286 --> 26:30.889
I'm hungry and I'm gonna go
and get some scran.

26:30.956 --> 26:33.091
And have a piss.

26:46.571 --> 26:48.506
Hi, darling, you all right?!

26:48.573 --> 26:50.775
Oh!

26:50.842 --> 26:52.210
Hi, guys.

26:52.277 --> 26:54.479
You glad to be back in the town?

26:54.546 --> 26:56.014
You missed us?
Yes, I have.

26:56.081 --> 26:57.082
Of course you have.

26:57.148 --> 27:00.318
Anna walks in
and she makes eye contact with me.

27:00.385 --> 27:04.622
I'm surprised her fanny hasn't blown
clean off over the garden fence.

27:04.689 --> 27:08.426
Can I ask all the new workers
to go the newbies room, please?

27:08.493 --> 27:10.562
Yeah.
Bye, guys.

27:12.630 --> 27:16.801
Anna sent all the newbies into
the bedroom. Shit's just got real.

27:16.868 --> 27:19.637
You know I couldn't be with you
in Tignes, yeah?

27:19.704 --> 27:24.042
And I asked for your help. How are
the new workers getting on now?

27:24.109 --> 27:25.777
Every single night it changes.

27:25.844 --> 27:29.981
Obviously the newbies have arguments
and the next day we feel awkward.

27:30.048 --> 27:31.416
It changes all the time.

27:31.483 --> 27:36.187
All this time, Anna thinks we've been
telling her the best workers,

27:36.254 --> 27:38.490
but we've told her
who we wanna live with.

27:38.556 --> 27:41.059
I've got a feeling
someone's getting the boot.

27:41.126 --> 27:45.597
I think being away and going away
with them has changed my mind.

27:45.663 --> 27:48.533
And work-wise,
who stood out mainly at work?

27:48.600 --> 27:51.069
Zahida's the best at work,
I'm not gonna lie.

27:51.136 --> 27:53.405
She's the best at work.
I agree.

27:53.471 --> 27:55.907
After last night,
Zahida did let herself go,

27:55.974 --> 27:58.476
but I feel like
I do get on with her the most.

27:58.543 --> 28:02.680
I only want the three best workers.

28:02.747 --> 28:04.883
Shit.
All right?

28:04.949 --> 28:08.887
Does that mean what I think?
Another newbie's getting the axe?

28:08.953 --> 28:11.389
Anna, man, you're fucking brutal.

28:11.456 --> 28:14.959
It's easy for me. I want Zahida out.

28:15.026 --> 28:16.494
(laughter)

28:16.561 --> 28:19.798
After the way Zahida went on
last night, it's a no-brainer.

28:19.864 --> 28:22.734
I don't want her in this house.
That girl has to go.

28:22.801 --> 28:26.337
My top three is Zahida,
Sam and Abbie.

28:26.404 --> 28:28.506
Yeah, I wouldn't have Sarah.

28:28.573 --> 28:30.942
I dunno what's going through
Scott's head,

28:31.009 --> 28:34.746
but he wants Sam, Zahida and Abbie
to stay. What the hell, Scott?

28:34.813 --> 28:36.481
Do you now wanna shag Sam?

28:39.050 --> 28:41.052
It's this bit I don't like.

28:41.119 --> 28:44.089
Knowing they're, like,
in there talking now.

28:44.155 --> 28:46.324
Oh, God, I know.
That's what I don't like.

28:46.391 --> 28:48.960
We're sat in the room
and dunno what's going on.

28:49.027 --> 28:52.697
Everybody's nervous
and my arse is like that...

28:52.764 --> 28:56.501
I hate knowing you're unsafe.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.170
That you could be dropped
at any second.

28:59.237 --> 29:02.841
I am absolutely shitting myself
after everything that's happened.

29:02.907 --> 29:06.010
If someone's going home,
it's definitely gonna be me.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.019
Your best three workers?
The three girls.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.456
I think we need three girls
who wanna work and enjoy themselves.

29:18.523 --> 29:20.024
OK.
I do think that.

29:20.091 --> 29:24.129
Right. I've listened to everything
that yous have had to say.

29:24.195 --> 29:27.165
Gary, would you get
the new workers in here, please?

29:27.232 --> 29:29.000
Go on, Gary, son.

29:30.168 --> 29:33.905
Everyone's made their choices
and it's too close to call.

29:33.972 --> 29:36.908
I feel like I'm leading
the lambs to the slaughter.

29:36.975 --> 29:39.677
I would hate to be in their shoes.

29:39.744 --> 29:41.179
It's time.

29:41.246 --> 29:44.883
Oh, no!
Ah!

29:44.949 --> 29:47.819
Gary's came to take wuh
through to see Anna.

29:47.886 --> 29:49.521
Shit. This is it.

29:50.788 --> 29:53.024
Oh, God.
Thanks for joining us.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.093
I can't look.

29:55.160 --> 29:58.496
As you know, I'm not gonna be able
to take you all on full-time.

29:58.563 --> 30:02.901
I only want the three best workers
to go through to the next stage.

30:02.967 --> 30:05.303
Fuck me, is that not it?

30:05.370 --> 30:09.440
How many newbies
is this fucker gonna be keeping?

30:11.075 --> 30:13.545
Sarah, Zahida...

30:17.649 --> 30:19.551
...and Abbie.

30:20.485 --> 30:22.086
Sam won't be needed.

30:22.153 --> 30:23.788
That's fucking balls, man.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.825
We knew that at some point,
someone was gonna go home,

30:27.892 --> 30:30.828
but when it happens and it hits you,
it hits you hard.

30:32.397 --> 30:36.100
Sam, go and get your things
together. Go and get packed.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.303
Sam is going home.

30:38.369 --> 30:40.104
Anna, have you met Sarah before?

30:40.171 --> 30:42.740
The only thing she's good at
is holding grudges

30:42.807 --> 30:44.909
or turning on the waterworks.

30:46.644 --> 30:49.981
This is brutal. Anna's not even
giving us time to let it sink in.

30:50.048 --> 30:52.016
She's already got us
packing me bags.

30:52.083 --> 30:55.653
Listen, girls, you've done amazing.
Thanks for your hard work.

30:55.720 --> 30:57.789
See you later.
Thanks, Anna.

30:57.855 --> 30:59.958
Bye.
Imagine if we were in that position.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.660
What a bitch.
Honestly, it's not good.

31:02.727 --> 31:04.062
It's awful.

31:04.128 --> 31:06.664
Seeing any of the newbies go
is heart-breaking,

31:06.731 --> 31:09.367
because I consider them
as part of the family.

31:09.434 --> 31:12.804
You know, it's so horrible,
it's so hard,

31:12.870 --> 31:16.975
but this why Anna put you in,
do you know what I mean?

31:17.041 --> 31:19.010
You all need to be friends
and make up.

31:19.077 --> 31:22.213
Sophie's right.
These lot are a family.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.917
If we wanna be part of it, we need
to learn to bury the hatchet.

31:25.984 --> 31:27.552
Me heart breaks.

31:35.126 --> 31:36.761
Nah, mate.

31:36.828 --> 31:38.596
Gary!

31:40.732 --> 31:42.900
It's time to say goodbye
to everyone.

31:42.967 --> 31:46.037
It's sad knowing that I'm not
gonna be out with them tonight

31:46.104 --> 31:49.607
and I'm not gonna be here in the
morning, or the next, or the next.

31:49.674 --> 31:51.209
It's all just a bit shit.

31:52.677 --> 31:54.145
Oh, fucking hell.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.250
I'm gutted that Sam is leaving.

31:59.317 --> 32:01.653
But I'm so relieved to be staying.

32:01.719 --> 32:05.823
Hopefully this is it
and now I'm part of the family.

32:07.492 --> 32:11.562
I can't believe Sam's the one
who has to go and not me.

32:11.629 --> 32:15.233
After everything that's happened,
how the fuck have I got away?

32:16.234 --> 32:17.835
I'm gutted, man.

32:18.836 --> 32:21.406
Bullshit. Actually is.

32:21.472 --> 32:25.009
I really don't wanna say goodbye
to Sam, but Anna's made a decision.

32:25.076 --> 32:28.212
She has to live with it
when one of these newbies fuck up.

32:31.149 --> 32:34.052
I can't believe I'm off home,
cos I didn't get the job.

32:34.118 --> 32:38.890
I think she was worried she wouldn't
be able to keep her hands off us.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.692
(laughter)

32:41.726 --> 32:44.462
At the end of the day,
it's shit when someone leaves,

32:44.529 --> 32:48.199
but the kid's from Newcastle.
He's only going round the corner.

32:54.772 --> 32:56.407
(cheering)

32:56.474 --> 32:58.509
I'm having a mint time!

33:00.812 --> 33:03.348
All I want to do right now is run.

33:03.414 --> 33:06.684
Scott and Zahida
did actually neck on.

33:06.751 --> 33:09.420
Just maybe this time
I might have fucked it.

33:09.487 --> 33:12.090
You should have told me.
Now I look like a twat.

33:12.156 --> 33:15.727
How the hell can I be Zahida's
best friend after this?

33:15.793 --> 33:18.429
(teary) No one cares about us.

33:18.496 --> 33:20.565
(all) Geordie Shore, why aye!

33:22.967 --> 33:23.167
.

33:25.670 --> 33:25.870
.

33:39.450 --> 33:42.286
Where the fuck,
where the fuck are yous lot?

33:42.353 --> 33:45.456
Where the fuck, where the fuck,
where the fuck are yous lot?

33:45.523 --> 33:48.659
I'm gutted Sam's gone.
Gonna be weird as fuck without him.

33:48.726 --> 33:51.262
He's like my left ball,
he's just attached to us.

33:51.329 --> 33:53.564
Boys, birds, banter.
Wicked. Let's go!

33:53.631 --> 33:55.066
(cheering)

33:57.835 --> 34:01.739
So far, I've kept everything
with me and Scott under wraps.

34:01.806 --> 34:06.010
So, tonight, I need to stay away
and draw a line under it.

34:10.748 --> 34:15.052
Me heart breaks for Sam, but we get
to the club, the music's bouncing,

34:15.119 --> 34:18.188
the drinks are flowing
and I'm having a mint time!

34:22.893 --> 34:25.763
(cheering)

34:35.639 --> 34:39.243
Me and Marnie are having a chat and
it's so nice we're in a good place.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.279
We've both got each other's backs,

34:41.344 --> 34:43.748
and I'm so happy
that I've got my mate back.

34:54.625 --> 34:57.662
I'm pleased that me and Aaron
are getting on really well.

34:57.728 --> 35:01.632
I've waited so long for this and
it shows that our bond is so strong.

35:08.806 --> 35:12.577
Tonight I feel like I need to tell
someone what happened with Zahida.

35:12.643 --> 35:14.745
Who better to tell than my pal, Gaz?

35:14.812 --> 35:17.448
Because at the moment,
my head's all over the shop.

35:19.317 --> 35:21.519
Scott comes over like,
"Can I have a word?"

35:21.586 --> 35:23.921
What the hell could this be?

35:26.624 --> 35:29.460
Now he's telling me
that he did neck on with Zahida.

35:29.527 --> 35:32.797
I should go mental here
cos you've lied to me, the lads,

35:32.864 --> 35:34.432
you've lied to everybody.

35:41.372 --> 35:45.209
The reason I kept it secret is cos
it's Zahida's decision to tell,

35:45.276 --> 35:47.812
because she's the one
with the boyfriend.

35:47.879 --> 35:49.480
Where as I've got nowt to lose.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.589
Zahida's gonna have to learn
the hard way like we have.

35:58.656 --> 36:01.259
If you wanna live in this house
with this family,

36:01.325 --> 36:04.996
you can't have secrets. You've
gotta own up and admit mistakes.

36:13.004 --> 36:16.807
Gaz is telling me that he's gonna
speak to Zahida about me and her.

36:16.874 --> 36:20.177
Cheers for the heads up, mate,
cos it's gonna go that John West,

36:20.244 --> 36:22.513
I'll need mayonnaise
and a baked potato.

36:27.051 --> 36:30.588
I look over and Scott and Gary
are having a serious conversation.

36:30.655 --> 36:33.858
I'm praying Scott hasn't
let the cat out of the bad.

36:33.925 --> 36:35.626
Otherwise I'm fucked.

36:51.442 --> 36:54.845
I've kept kissing Scott a secret
for so long

36:54.912 --> 36:57.481
that I don't know how
I can ever tell them now.

37:04.322 --> 37:07.091
I know what it's like
being a newbie and fitting in.

37:07.158 --> 37:09.961
But having a boyfriend
is holding Zahida back.

37:33.250 --> 37:36.120
Gary tells us that he knows
I've kissed Scott.

37:36.187 --> 37:38.055
My stomach has dropped.

37:38.122 --> 37:41.158
I can't believe I thought
this wasn't gonna come out.

37:47.765 --> 37:50.735
Believe me, it is the worst
having secrets in this house.

37:50.801 --> 37:54.071
Zahida needs to come clean,
cos it's better in the long run.

37:57.675 --> 38:00.811
I can see Gary talking to Zahida
and she looks upset.

38:00.878 --> 38:02.980
This has gotta be
about her and Scott.

38:03.047 --> 38:05.049
I hope Gary
gets to the bottom of it.

38:12.757 --> 38:15.826
Seeing everyone's faces
makes me realise

38:15.893 --> 38:18.029
they know I've done something wrong,

38:18.095 --> 38:21.599
and I haven't had the chance
to man up and own up to my mistake.

38:27.204 --> 38:29.373
I don't wanna talk
to a single person.

38:29.440 --> 38:32.276
I can't.
Everyone's gonna turn against us.

38:32.343 --> 38:35.880
All I want to do right now is run.

38:35.946 --> 38:38.649
And I'm not coming back.

38:48.893 --> 38:51.896
Zahida's got upset
and stormed out of Bijoux.

38:51.962 --> 38:55.933
We need to get back to the house
and find out what's going on.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.902
Let's go.
Come on, everyone!

38:57.968 --> 38:59.704
Scott, boys and girls, let's go!

39:01.572 --> 39:04.575
Zahida's not here,
so we got one more room.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.985
We get back to the house
and Zahida is nowhere to be seen,

39:15.052 --> 39:17.455
but I seen her
crying her eyes out earlier.

39:17.521 --> 39:20.758
I don't understand what's happened
and where she is.

39:20.825 --> 39:22.893
Zahida...

39:22.960 --> 39:27.565
...I think, is freaked out a bit and
gone AWOL. I don't know where she is.

39:27.631 --> 39:30.801
I wish Zahida had taken my advice
and came clean,

39:30.868 --> 39:33.170
cos Scott reckons
it's not his place to say.

39:33.237 --> 39:37.241
So, for the good of the family, I'm
gonna explain why Zahida's gone AWOL.

39:37.308 --> 39:39.543
I just hope it doesn't go nuclear.

39:39.610 --> 39:44.215
Other night in the taxi,
it wasn't "did they or didn't they."

39:44.281 --> 39:48.319
Everyone knows I'm the only kid in
Newcastle who doesn't give a shit.

39:48.385 --> 39:51.889
So, Gaz, if you wanna stand there
and tell everyone what went on,

39:51.956 --> 39:53.624
then fucking crack on, kid.

39:53.691 --> 39:56.627
Scott and Zahida
did actually neck on.

39:59.130 --> 40:03.000
I had her back. That night
in Tignes, I had her back.

40:03.067 --> 40:07.371
I said to you Zahida didn't do it.
That's really pissed us off.

40:07.438 --> 40:10.141
Zahida has been giving me advice
about Scott,

40:10.207 --> 40:12.376
but then secretly
necking on with him.

40:12.443 --> 40:14.445
And she knows how much I like him.

40:14.512 --> 40:16.781
That is the lowest of the low.

40:16.847 --> 40:19.049
I admit I tried to neck on with her.

40:19.116 --> 40:21.118
I didn't wanna say,
cos she has a lad.

40:21.185 --> 40:23.687
It was up to her.
Why would you try it on, though?

40:23.754 --> 40:26.657
I said that, because I was smashed.

40:26.724 --> 40:29.527
You shoulda told me.
Now I look like a fucking twat.

40:29.593 --> 40:33.864
I am so proud that Abbie
has finally stood up for herself.

40:33.931 --> 40:36.367
To be in this house,
you have to have a back bone.

40:36.433 --> 40:40.171
You've gotta protect yourself.
So, Abbie, good on you, pet.

40:41.205 --> 40:44.375
I just thought that Z
would never ever do that to us.

40:44.441 --> 40:49.046
A best friend, to me,
is someone that you're 100% loyal to.

40:49.113 --> 40:50.948
That is your number one girl.

40:51.015 --> 40:55.452
Someone you would never, ever
in a million years dream of hurting.

40:55.519 --> 40:59.256
How the hell can I be Zahida's
best friend after this?

40:59.323 --> 41:02.660
You've got with Zahida...
It was up to her to say.

41:02.726 --> 41:04.161
You should have told me.

41:04.228 --> 41:08.532
Everyone's going berserk,
kicking off and I'm at the centre,

41:08.599 --> 41:11.702
but I don't see how I get blamed
for any of it at all.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.904
It's not my fault
that I'm irresistible.

41:15.272 --> 41:16.373
Abbie.

41:16.440 --> 41:19.643
If Zahida was here, I think
it would be a different story.

41:19.710 --> 41:20.811
(all) Oh!

41:22.646 --> 41:25.583
Right, guys... I'd like to just say

41:25.649 --> 41:28.652
I'm glad I've never shagged
any of yous. I'm going to bed.

41:28.719 --> 41:31.889
I thought everyone was gonna make up
and get back to normal.

41:31.956 --> 41:35.960
But, no. Gary dropped a bombshell
that Zahida and Scott had kissed

41:36.026 --> 41:37.561
and I've ate a lot of pizza.

41:37.628 --> 41:40.464
It's time to go to bed
and deal with the drama tomorrow.

41:43.567 --> 41:45.369
(blows raspberry)

41:45.436 --> 41:47.004
Is there a drought?

41:47.071 --> 41:48.339
(laughter)

41:48.405 --> 41:51.342
Another night, another argument.
For me, I'm sweet.

41:51.408 --> 41:54.578
Me and Marnie are getting on well,
I've got no drama,

41:54.645 --> 41:58.749
so I can go to sleep in my own bed
with a smile on my face.

41:58.816 --> 42:00.885
I don't want a library,
I'm not a reader.

42:00.951 --> 42:03.854
Didn't tell anyone
I necked on with Zahida.

42:03.921 --> 42:05.389
I don't regret my decision.

42:05.456 --> 42:08.125
Like I said,
I'm a kid who lives in the moment.

42:08.192 --> 42:11.695
But maybe, just maybe,
this time I might have fucked it.

42:17.635 --> 42:19.970
It's fucking shit. It is shit.

42:20.037 --> 42:21.972
If you'd have told me
a few hours ago

42:22.039 --> 42:26.176
that me and Sarah would join forces,
I'd have told you to go and jump.

42:26.243 --> 42:29.580
It's mad how quickly
things can change in this house.

42:29.647 --> 42:34.985
(crying) The person that I trusted...
the most...

42:35.986 --> 42:39.089
...doesn't care about us.

42:39.156 --> 42:41.892
No one cares about us.

42:41.959 --> 42:45.129
Do you know what it is? I kissed
Scott and he preferred Abbie.

42:45.195 --> 42:47.331
And that's fine. But Zahida, though?

42:47.398 --> 42:51.568
She knows I still like him
and did the worst thing she could do

42:51.635 --> 42:54.038
by going behind my back
and betraying us.

42:59.810 --> 43:01.345
Hello!

43:01.412 --> 43:03.514
It's time to get this party started.

43:07.251 --> 43:10.854
This night is a fucking disaster.
I've got needs.

43:10.921 --> 43:14.925
It's obvious I'm interested in you.
Tonight is gonna be a good one.

43:14.992 --> 43:18.862
I'll always love her.
This divvy needs to stop dancing.

43:18.929 --> 43:20.197
(shouting)

43:20.264 --> 43:22.967
Fucking, ding-ding! It's going off!

43:23.033 --> 43:24.301
Oops.

43:24.368 --> 43:27.705
"Only one of the girls
will join the team full-time."

43:27.771 --> 43:29.640
The competition is heating up.

43:31.875 --> 43:33.811
Maybe the girl does deserve a break.

43:33.877 --> 43:35.813
Stop making a fucking fool
out of us!

43:35.879 --> 43:37.047
How fucking dare she?

43:37.114 --> 43:39.249
(crash)
Fuck! Marnie, man!

44:04.441 --> 44:04.641
.
