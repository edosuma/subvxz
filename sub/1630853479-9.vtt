TOM SWIFT #109
"...And the Night to Remember"
Closed Captioned

00:01.418 --> 00:03.962
I'm Tom Swift,
inventor, billionaire,

00:04.004 --> 00:06.131
shoe collector extraordinaire.

00:06.172 --> 00:08.091
But none of that was
good enough for my dad.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.051
I thought if I built him
a spaceship to Saturn,

00:10.093 --> 00:11.928
I could earn his love,

00:11.970 --> 00:13.513
but his mission
ended tragically.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.515
Or so I thought.

00:15.557 --> 00:18.351
Turns out, he was sabotaged.

00:18.393 --> 00:21.104
My father survived the attack
and sent me a message capsule

00:21.146 --> 00:23.064
with the data I need
to rescue him from space,

00:23.106 --> 00:26.192
but it exploded
when it entered the atmosphere.

00:26.234 --> 00:27.694
Now I have to find the pieces
of that capsule

00:27.736 --> 00:30.113
and reassemble my dad's message.

00:30.155 --> 00:32.282
A global conspiracy
called The Road Back

00:32.323 --> 00:34.826
is standing in my way,
so I can only trust my squad:

00:34.868 --> 00:37.120
my best friend Zenzi,
my bodyguard Isaac,

00:37.162 --> 00:41.332
my adopted brother Lino,
and my AI Barclay.

00:41.374 --> 00:43.084
Together, we're going
to find my father

00:43.126 --> 00:44.836
and bring him home.

No.

01:08.443 --> 01:10.320
No. The Road Back has
agents everywhere.

01:10.361 --> 01:13.031
Anyone we turn them over to
would just let them go.

01:13.073 --> 01:14.866
Well, should we wait
for Rowan to get back

01:14.908 --> 01:17.077
from taking Andrita
into hiding?

01:17.118 --> 01:18.745
He knows firsthand
how these guys operate.

01:18.787 --> 01:22.082
Ah, no, no, no, no.
We don't have time to wait.

01:22.123 --> 01:23.792
BARCLAY:
Tom's right.
Earth will soon be at apogee

01:23.833 --> 01:26.294
and in position to send
Barton's rescue drone to Saturn.

I was able to pinpoint
every cell tower

01:38.807 --> 01:40.141
our captives' phones
have accessed

01:40.183 --> 01:41.935

four days ago.

01:41.976 --> 01:44.104
You'd be interested to know
that one pinged a cell tower

Snow Canyon State Park.

01:51.694 --> 01:53.947
That's the place where the last
capsule piece went dark.

01:53.988 --> 01:55.782
Coincidence?
Not likely.

01:55.824 --> 01:58.076
If Susannah Robb's men
were sent there,

01:58.118 --> 02:00.745
it probably means...
Susannah has
my capsule piece.

Hey, Barclay?

02:30.650 --> 02:33.736
What are the odds that
what my father wanted me to know

02:33.778 --> 02:35.155
was...

02:35.196 --> 02:36.656
(chuckles)

02:36.698 --> 02:38.950
how much he really loved me,

We're giving the men

salmon croquettes?

03:18.448 --> 03:21.451
They're the only
leftovers that we have.

03:23.536 --> 03:24.871
You warmed them up.

03:24.913 --> 03:27.916
Have you ever eaten
cold salmon?

03:27.957 --> 03:30.001
I'm not a monster.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.841
Listen,
about last night...

03:38.426 --> 03:40.053
ESKOL: Where do you keep
your bottle opener?

open this bottle of red.

(Zenzi exhales)

03:46.017 --> 03:47.810
Timing really is
everything.

03:47.852 --> 03:48.978
Huh.

03:49.020 --> 03:50.980
So are the choices
we make.

03:51.022 --> 03:53.316
Yes, and I might have made
a different choice

03:53.358 --> 03:55.610
had you expressed
your feelings sooner.

03:55.652 --> 03:57.737
(electronic chirp)
(hands clap)

03:57.779 --> 03:58.863
TOM:
I did it.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.823
So, Susannah Robb

04:00.865 --> 04:04.452
got her stank hands on one
of the last capsule pieces.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.119
We can't track it

04:05.161 --> 04:08.248
because the capsule's copper
alloy signal has faded.

04:08.289 --> 04:10.959
Which means there's only
one place to look.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.336
Susannah's memories.

04:13.753 --> 04:16.089
Oh, I'm sorry. Do you keep
them in a drawer somewhere

04:16.130 --> 04:17.090
with your pants that fit?

04:17.131 --> 04:19.133
No. No, no.

04:19.175 --> 04:21.511
No, I keep it the same place
you keep Marcus's toothbrush.

04:21.552 --> 04:22.637
I...

04:24.389 --> 04:26.015
But this,

04:26.057 --> 04:28.142
this will give us
access to it.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.687
Swiftsight.

04:31.229 --> 04:33.898
I... I thought Swiftsight
instantly increased

04:33.940 --> 04:35.942
your ability to
retain information,

04:35.984 --> 04:37.277
like tenfold.
It did.

04:37.318 --> 04:38.945
But deleting Barclay's backups,

04:38.987 --> 04:41.698
it freed up significant
additional memory

04:41.739 --> 04:43.950
needed for me to modify
the neocortex stimulator

04:43.992 --> 04:45.576
to focus
on the hippocampus.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.745
(scoffs)
And Barclay?

04:47.787 --> 04:49.163
Barclay is fine.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.208
His backups replenish
every 12 hours anyways.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.377
Now, Swiftsight
can access

04:54.419 --> 04:56.879
specific recent
and forgotten memories.

04:56.921 --> 04:58.756
If we can get this on Susannah,

04:58.798 --> 05:00.425
we can get her to
reveal the-the memory

05:00.466 --> 05:02.260
of where she's hiding
that capsule piece.

05:02.302 --> 05:04.721
How exactly are we going to
get her to put that thing on?

05:04.762 --> 05:05.805
Mm-hmm.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.557
By inviting
Swift Enterprises'

05:07.598 --> 05:10.351
premier investor to dinner.

05:12.687 --> 05:14.480
The car.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.525
Pulled from the Swift family
VIP fleet,

05:17.567 --> 05:19.319
Susannah will be
picked up in style

05:19.360 --> 05:22.196
in the most beloved
self-operating experience.

05:22.238 --> 05:23.906
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Good evening, Ms. Robb.

Ooh.

05:31.956 --> 05:34.500
Hmm. Got to be

05:34.542 --> 05:37.253
Stylish and ready
for anything

05:37.295 --> 05:38.713
while that woman is
in your house.

05:39.964 --> 05:42.759
Finally, the invention.

05:42.800 --> 05:45.595
Swiftsight: The Remix.

05:46.804 --> 05:47.764
Now,

05:47.805 --> 05:51.726
for our first
test run...

05:55.605 --> 05:56.689
Zenzi?

06:03.279 --> 06:05.907
Can't we use the Swiftsight
on the operatives?

06:05.948 --> 06:07.825
Get them to give up
whatever they know?

06:07.867 --> 06:11.120
Swiftsight only works
on willing participants.

06:11.162 --> 06:13.414
But if we make them
an offer they can't refuse,

06:13.456 --> 06:15.249
let's see what kind
of kinks they're into.

06:15.291 --> 06:18.461
You know, this whole wine cellar
prison thing could be a vibe.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.587
No.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.591
Listen, I promise
to choose a memory

06:23.633 --> 06:25.593
that's nice and boring.

06:26.511 --> 06:28.137
Like your skin care routine.

06:28.179 --> 06:30.848
I hope you take notes because
everyone needs sunscreen.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.142
Everyone.

06:33.184 --> 06:36.104
Inside the house, too.
Oh, okay. Okay.
(shushing)

06:42.193 --> 06:45.279
Now count backwards from 100.

06:46.239 --> 06:49.325
(exhales softly)
99...

06:49.367 --> 06:50.451
98...

06:52.537 --> 06:53.996
97...

06:54.038 --> 06:57.417
Think of the last time
you exfoliated.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.502
It was last night.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.713
I began to open
my beauty drawer and...

07:02.755 --> 07:05.007
take out my moisturizer.

07:06.551 --> 07:08.803
Then I stopped.

07:10.221 --> 07:12.432
Somebody knocking on my door.

07:15.393 --> 07:17.937
Nathan? What are you
doing in here?

07:17.979 --> 07:19.605
Okay, that's enough.

07:23.568 --> 07:26.821
Why was Congressman
Nathan Eskol

07:26.863 --> 07:28.573
knocking at your door
last night?

07:28.614 --> 07:30.867
What?
And how did Isaac know?

07:30.908 --> 07:32.577
Unless...

07:32.618 --> 07:34.203
Ooh...

07:34.245 --> 07:37.415
Is there some kind of swirly
throuple going on here?

07:37.457 --> 07:39.333
No.
Of course not.

07:39.375 --> 07:40.543
(phone vibrating)
Mm.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.128
Anyway.

07:43.087 --> 07:44.797
Swiftsight works.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.011
Um...
I should take this.

07:55.266 --> 07:57.226
ZENZI:
Nathan, hi.

07:57.268 --> 07:59.145
Hey, it's good
to hear your voice.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.771
Likewise.

08:00.813 --> 08:03.024
I, um, I came by
Swift Enterprises.

08:03.065 --> 08:04.734
They said you're
working off-site.

08:04.775 --> 08:06.903
I am. It's, um,

08:06.944 --> 08:08.070
kind of a crazy day.

08:08.112 --> 08:09.447
Well, I-I won't keep you, then.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.449
But I, uh, I was hoping

08:11.491 --> 08:13.743
that I could see you tonight.

08:13.784 --> 08:16.120
I'm actually having dinner

08:16.162 --> 08:18.581
with Tom and Susannah Robb.

08:18.623 --> 08:20.166
Tom invited her.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.919
Wait, is this because of
what I told you last night

08:22.960 --> 08:24.128
about her being...?

08:24.170 --> 08:26.047
The secret leader
of The Road Back?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.673
Don't worry.

08:27.715 --> 08:30.051
No, I'm going to worry.

08:30.092 --> 08:31.427
I-I care about you.

08:31.469 --> 08:33.054
What if I join you?

08:33.095 --> 08:34.639
Right? Susannah will think

08:34.680 --> 08:36.432
she has another
Road Back member in the room.

08:36.474 --> 08:38.559
One more reason
to let her guard down,

08:38.601 --> 08:40.353
if that's what
you're hoping for.

08:40.394 --> 08:42.104
Hmm.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.482
Tom is inviting someone, too.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.775
But I'm not helping you.

08:45.816 --> 08:47.318
Why not?

08:47.360 --> 08:48.819
Um, my therapist says
that you only call me

08:48.861 --> 08:50.071
when you feel like it,

08:50.112 --> 08:51.781
and you ignore me
when you don't.

08:51.822 --> 08:53.783
She says that I should
have some dignity

08:53.824 --> 08:57.954
and think about my needs
instead of yours.

08:57.995 --> 09:00.081
I seem to remember
thinking about your needs

09:00.122 --> 09:01.123
after the Summit.

09:01.165 --> 09:02.500
Look,

09:02.542 --> 09:05.962
your therapist, she seems
very wise, right?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.005
But she's wrong here.
I have been busy...

09:08.047 --> 09:09.465
Doing what, Tom?

09:09.507 --> 09:10.883
Saving my fath...

09:10.925 --> 09:13.052
(chuckles)
Saving my father's company.

09:13.094 --> 09:16.013
I just need
a little help reassuring

09:16.055 --> 09:18.224
Susannah that the Swifts
still know how to show

09:18.266 --> 09:21.394
investors gratitude
with a little wining and dining.

09:21.435 --> 09:23.187
Tell me we don't make

09:23.229 --> 09:24.272
a great team.

09:24.313 --> 09:25.398
Yeah, but...

09:25.439 --> 09:27.066
Clearly, I don't just want you.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.484
I need you, boy.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.152
More than you know.

09:30.194 --> 09:34.156
And maybe afterwards,
we can celebrate like we did

09:34.198 --> 09:36.158
after the Summit, hmm?

09:36.200 --> 09:38.369
Unless you don't want me
to do that thing with...

09:38.411 --> 09:39.453
Fine.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.289
I'll be there at 6:00.

09:41.330 --> 09:43.332
But you're covering
my therapy co-pay.

09:43.374 --> 09:44.333
Mm-hmm?

09:44.375 --> 09:45.501
Thank you.

09:49.046 --> 09:50.172
Hi.
ESKOL:
Hi.

09:50.214 --> 09:52.341
(chuckling):
Congressman.

09:52.383 --> 09:53.467
Welcome.

09:57.054 --> 09:58.639
Has, uh, Susannah arrived?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.683
SUSANNAH:
She has now.

10:00.725 --> 10:02.602
Congressman Eskol.
Hi.

10:02.643 --> 10:04.270
Zenzi, you look beautiful.

10:04.312 --> 10:06.522
Wow, how lovely to see you both.

10:06.564 --> 10:09.150
Together. Again.

10:11.152 --> 10:12.236
TOM:

Mwah.

10:15.406 --> 10:16.699

10:18.409 --> 10:20.661

JUSTIN:
Thank you.

10:32.173 --> 10:36.469
(indistinct chatter)

10:36.510 --> 10:38.304
Anyway, anyway, anyway.

10:38.346 --> 10:40.139
I see Tom across the room

10:40.181 --> 10:41.307

10:41.349 --> 10:43.184
"That's the man
I'm gonna marry."

10:43.225 --> 10:43.517
Ooh.

10:43.517 --> 10:45.394

10:45.436 --> 10:46.812
"That is a man
I'd marry..."

10:46.854 --> 10:47.897
(snaps fingers)
"...without a prenup."

10:47.938 --> 10:49.065

with the wrong head again."

11:12.171 --> 11:13.589

11:15.383 --> 11:17.677

11:19.178 --> 11:21.138
Take my latest invention.
Swiftsight.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.348
A neural device

11:22.390 --> 11:23.891
that attaches to your temple.

11:23.933 --> 11:25.476
It increases
your cognitive speed

11:25.518 --> 11:28.062
and your ability to retain
information tenfold.

11:28.104 --> 11:28.646
Technically, yes,

11:28.646 --> 11:31.732
but legally it's still
in prototype phase.

11:31.774 --> 11:34.151
Unlike that Panigale V4
you ride every Thursday.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.820
Oh, you want to take
my bike out for a spin?

11:35.861 --> 11:37.905

You were saying...

11:40.282 --> 11:45.121

while Swiftsight is

11:45.162 --> 11:48.207
still in prototype phase,

11:48.249 --> 11:50.292
the neuro tech is something
you must experience

11:50.334 --> 11:51.711
before it hits the market...
JUSTIN:
Swiftsight

11:51.752 --> 11:52.420
won't be market-ready
for a while, babe.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.547
Oh, but that's the beauty
of early access, sweetie.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.965

a safe product rollout

11:56.006 --> 11:57.466

12:00.594 --> 12:02.888

spillage every time...

12:02.930 --> 12:03.973

Swiftsight?

12:13.107 --> 12:14.984
I've read the
internal diligence

12:15.025 --> 12:16.360
and reviewed
the prototype testing.

12:16.402 --> 12:17.361
It's not ready.

12:17.403 --> 12:18.988
If Susannah tries it on

12:19.029 --> 12:20.239
and something goes wrong,

12:20.281 --> 12:21.574
she'll bail,
word will get around,

12:21.615 --> 12:22.992
and then Swiftsight
is screwed.

12:23.033 --> 12:24.785
Unless...

12:25.703 --> 12:27.037
...there's something
going on

12:27.079 --> 12:28.914
I don't know about.
No, no, no, no.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.000
The only thing you need to know
is that Swiftsight is ready.

12:31.041 --> 12:32.585

12:32.626 --> 12:34.044

If Justin has convinced Susannah
not to try out Swiftsight,

12:45.723 --> 12:47.558
we're going to need
a backup plan.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.686
Hmm. Well, the hostages still
won't be willing participants,

12:50.728 --> 12:53.898
but I can explore a different
interrogation tactic.

12:53.939 --> 12:55.566
I can question Eskol.

12:55.608 --> 12:58.360
Maybe he knows more
than he realizes.
Okay, then.

Susannah pole one more time.

19:36.508 --> 19:38.218
where you didn't
have to worry about

19:38.260 --> 19:40.679
the unintended consequences
of accelerated technology.

19:40.721 --> 19:43.098
Think about
social media platforms.

19:43.140 --> 19:44.933
They started off as
a way for you to connect

19:44.975 --> 19:47.603
with your college buddies and
then they turned into a cesspool

19:47.644 --> 19:49.521
of bullying
and false information

19:49.563 --> 19:51.356
that threatens our democracy.

19:51.398 --> 19:52.816
Household plastics
brought convenience,

19:52.858 --> 19:55.485
but mass manufacturing
of those plastics,

19:55.527 --> 19:57.404
well, has nearly
destroyed our planet.

19:57.446 --> 20:01.074
Okay, you're
an environmentalist.

20:01.116 --> 20:02.784
Cool. Plant a tree.

20:02.826 --> 20:06.288
Why kill when
you can just compost?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.207
Because bad tech
is everywhere.

20:08.248 --> 20:09.875
(scoffs)

20:09.917 --> 20:12.127
Think of the cotton gin.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.050
Slavery was winding down

20:18.091 --> 20:20.010
in the United States
before its invention.

20:20.052 --> 20:21.845
Another five decades

20:21.887 --> 20:25.474
of human bondage, thanks to
that little agricultural tool.

20:25.515 --> 20:27.267
Every tech advance comes

20:27.309 --> 20:28.727
at a negative cost.

20:29.186 --> 20:33.774
I'm... I'm not asking you
to stop being an inventor.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.776
I'm asking you
to be an ethical one.

20:35.817 --> 20:38.612
To think about
the unintended consequences

20:38.654 --> 20:40.322
of your innovations,

20:40.364 --> 20:42.282
and to stop the irrational
advancement of technology

20:42.324 --> 20:44.284
before it irreparably
takes our society

20:44.326 --> 20:45.869
in the wrong direction.

20:45.911 --> 20:48.163
And killing an employee
with the use of a cell phone.

20:48.205 --> 20:50.499
Is that too far
in the wrong direction?

20:50.540 --> 20:52.834
Asking for a hostage friend.

20:52.876 --> 20:56.797
I am aware that I cannot
function in today's society

20:56.838 --> 20:58.799
without the use of some
modern conveniences.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.468
Oh, so only you get to decide
which modern conveniences

21:01.510 --> 21:03.178
are okay and which aren't?

21:03.220 --> 21:04.805
I believe I have
the discernment to use

21:04.846 --> 21:09.184
technology in moderation
for a larger purpose.

21:09.226 --> 21:11.645
The Road Back intends

21:11.687 --> 21:14.648

the control of humankind.

31:16.082 --> 31:17.709
but not before
he secretly risked

31:17.750 --> 31:19.335
lifelong damage
to your body.

31:19.377 --> 31:22.046
Because he was so desperate
to stop you from being gay.

31:24.048 --> 31:26.259
If you join The Road Back...

31:26.843 --> 31:29.637
...you can stop anyone from
experiencing the same pain

31:29.679 --> 31:31.598
our parents put us through.

31:40.899 --> 31:42.609
What do you say?

31:43.651 --> 31:45.778
I won't be joining in.

31:46.696 --> 31:47.822
And damn.

31:47.864 --> 31:49.866
I expected better.

31:49.908 --> 31:51.492
You said The Road Back
wants to return

31:51.534 --> 31:53.953
to a better, simpler time.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.038
For who?

31:55.079 --> 31:56.581
Because the simpler time

31:56.623 --> 32:00.001
for white people
was an arduous,

32:00.043 --> 32:02.295
exhausting, grueling,
and painful time

32:02.337 --> 32:04.255
for Black people.

32:04.297 --> 32:07.008
So, what does
The Road Back stand to gain

32:07.050 --> 32:11.012
by having Black billionaire
Tom Swift as a member?

32:11.054 --> 32:12.680
Well,

32:12.722 --> 32:14.432
there have always been
Black people that understand

32:14.474 --> 32:16.351
that unchecked progress
is a danger to us all.

32:16.392 --> 32:18.186
That's just racist.

32:18.227 --> 32:21.147
It's not racist.
I'm serving a higher purpose.

32:21.189 --> 32:23.358
Next you're gonna tell me
that you don't see color.

32:23.399 --> 32:25.068
Okay, I'm talking about
people like Ernest Withers.

32:25.109 --> 32:27.612
There are advantages to being
among the chosen few.

32:27.654 --> 32:30.031
Ernest Withers?
(scoffs)

32:30.073 --> 32:33.368
Ernest Withers was a Black
Civil Rights photographer

32:33.409 --> 32:36.412
paid by the FBI to inform

32:36.454 --> 32:39.415
on his own people.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.168
The man spied on MLK.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.545
I...

32:44.587 --> 32:46.756
I am Black.

32:46.798 --> 32:48.967
I'm not OJ.

32:49.008 --> 32:51.302

that your houseboy

32:51.344 --> 32:52.929
will not be named Tom Swift.

32:52.971 --> 32:56.057
I don't want you as my houseboy.

32:56.099 --> 32:57.475
Did I say that?

32:57.517 --> 32:58.935
You implied it.

32:58.977 --> 33:01.854
The Road Back wants you
for your foresight,

33:01.896 --> 33:03.982
ingenuity, and awareness.

33:10.071 --> 33:11.739
Well, you've heard my offer,

33:11.781 --> 33:13.408
you have 24 hours
to make a decision.

33:13.449 --> 33:14.784
In the meantime,

33:14.826 --> 33:17.036
I'll remove my employees
from your property.

33:19.288 --> 33:22.917
Or I can send more agents
to get my men and outnumber you.

33:24.877 --> 33:26.504
Okay.

Good choice.

Oh, and, Tom...
