19:43.367 --> 19:45.600
You don't just go taking
somebody's dog.

19:45.600 --> 19:47.500
>> KOURTNEY: Sushi!

19:51.700 --> 19:53.133
(birds singing)

19:56.333 --> 19:58.367
>> KRIS: Hello.
>> MJ: Oh, hello.

19:58.367 --> 20:00.700
How are you?
>> KRIS: Good. You look pretty.

20:00.700 --> 20:03.500
>> MJ: Welcome to my new nest.
>> KRIS: Oh, wow.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.500
Look at what you've done with
the place.

20:05.500 --> 20:07.934
Added a little touch of yellow.
>> MJ: Oh. A little touch of

20:07.934 --> 20:09.934
yellow here and there.
>> KRIS: You just have a lot

20:09.934 --> 20:11.934
going on.
>> MJ: Yeah, isn't that nice?

20:11.934 --> 20:13.934
>> KRIS: All in one, like...
>> MJ: Whoa!

20:13.934 --> 20:15.934
>> KRIS: The patterns and the...
It's a little crazy.

20:15.934 --> 20:17.767
>> MJ: Well, I love it.
>> KRIS: It's just a little

20:17.767 --> 20:19.767
cluttered over there.
>> MJ: Oh, yeah.

20:19.767 --> 20:22.967
>> KRIS: But, like, I spend a
lot of time picking things out

20:22.967 --> 20:24.967
and putting them in special
places, so...

20:24.967 --> 20:30.633
Mom, where's the blue Mixmaster
I gave you?

20:30.633 --> 20:34.033
>> MJ: Oh, uh, well, it was kind
of in the way.

20:34.033 --> 20:36.033
>> KRIS: Where's the Mixmaster?
I gave that to you.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.500
>> MJ: It's in the bathroom.
>> KRIS: Where?

20:38.500 --> 20:40.767
>> MJ: Straight ahead.
Just keep going straight ahead.

20:40.767 --> 20:43.200
There it is.
>> KRIS: Mom, you can't put the

20:43.200 --> 20:47.533
Mixmaster in the bathroom.
>> MJ: It fits perfect.

20:47.533 --> 20:50.800
>> KRIS: This is ridiculous.
You got to have it out.

20:50.800 --> 20:52.367
>> MJ: Why? I'd rather have
flowers.

20:52.367 --> 20:54.467
>> KRIS: 'Cause it's so cute.
>> MJ: No, no, no.

20:54.467 --> 20:56.834
That's-that's an eyesore.
>> KRIS: No, it's not.

20:56.834 --> 21:01.467
is an eyesore.
>> MJ: You didn't want me to be

21:01.467 --> 21:03.767
cluttered, remember?
>> KRIS: Well, cluttered is all

21:03.767 --> 21:05.734
that little goofy stuff you
have.

21:05.734 --> 21:07.734
I mean, once in a while...
>> MJ: Like the sugar and a

21:07.734 --> 21:09.734
creamer is goofy?
>> KRIS: Put it in the cupboard.

21:09.734 --> 21:11.567
There's just a lot of crap
there.

21:11.567 --> 21:13.934
>> MJ: No. I use it.
>> KRIS: I'm an extremely

21:13.934 --> 21:20.200
organized person, and when stuff
becomes a little scattered, I

21:20.200 --> 21:23.967
get really anxious.
But this is wild.

21:23.967 --> 21:28.800
I feel like the whole feng shui
of this condo is completely

21:28.800 --> 21:31.133
tilting, and I'm not sure what
to do about it.

21:31.133 --> 21:33.367
Wait. Did you change that piece
of art?

21:33.367 --> 21:35.266
>> MJ: It's so pretty with the
yellow.

21:35.266 --> 21:37.433
I mean, I think with all the
blue and white, we have to have

21:37.433 --> 21:39.333
yellow.
In fact, I might paint another

21:39.333 --> 21:41.333
bunny.
>> KRIS: Mom, you didn't paint

21:41.333 --> 21:43.033
that bunny.
>> MJ: I could.

21:43.033 --> 21:45.834
>> KRIS: Okay, you're gonna try
and copy one of the most famous

21:45.834 --> 21:48.567
bunny artists in the world?
>> MJ: No, I copied van Gogh in

21:48.567 --> 21:51.133
the bathroom, in the blue room.
>> KRIS: Oh, my God.

21:51.133 --> 21:53.266
>> MJ: So I go famous.
>> KRIS: Okay.

21:53.266 --> 22:05.166
Don't mess with MJ.
You go famous or go home.

22:05.166 --> 22:09.800
(ringtone playing)
>> KIM: Hello?

22:09.800 --> 22:12.400
>> KOURTNEY: Hi. I think you
took the wrong dog.

22:12.400 --> 22:14.867
>> KIM: No, I didn't.
What are you talking about?

22:14.867 --> 22:18.500
>> KOURTNEY: This dog keeps
barking, and, like, it's

22:18.500 --> 22:21.567
lighter, it's bigger.
It's not Honey.

22:21.567 --> 22:23.667
I think you took Honey.
>> KIM: No, I didn't.

22:23.667 --> 22:26.600
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.
(Kim laughs)

22:26.600 --> 22:28.600
You did.
This is not Honey.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.900
Trust me, I know.
Honey does not make a peep.

22:30.900 --> 22:35.000
This dog won't stop barking.
Reign is a pet detective, and he

22:35.000 --> 22:37.934
can tell, and he's two.
He said, "This is Northie's

22:37.934 --> 22:42.900
dog."
>> KIM: Aah! Okay, whatever.

22:42.900 --> 22:45.767
I...
I'm not coming back that way, so

22:45.767 --> 22:49.667
can we just swap tomorrow?
>> KOURTNEY: No, I will have

22:49.667 --> 22:52.133
someone come and swap the dogs.
>> KIM: You can handle it for

22:52.133 --> 22:56.033
one night, it's-- she's fine.
Kourtney figured it out, like,

22:56.033 --> 22:59.367
really fast, but I'm still
hopeful that maybe Penelope will

22:59.367 --> 23:03.400
bond with Sushi, and that she
won't want to give her back, but

23:03.400 --> 23:05.467
I don't know if that's gonna
happen.

23:05.467 --> 23:07.467
>> KOURTNEY: You so did this on
purpose.

23:07.467 --> 23:10.500
>> KIM: No, I didn't, honestly.
>> KOURTNEY: No, honestly.

23:10.500 --> 23:12.800
(Kim laughs)
>> KOURTNEY: Okay.

23:12.800 --> 23:14.800
>> KIM: Okay.
>> KOURTNEY: Bye.

23:14.800 --> 23:26.300
>> KIM: Bye.
(Honey barking)

23:26.300 --> 23:28.133
(gunshots)
>> KHLOE: It's, like, such a

23:28.133 --> 23:30.133
real place.
>> KENDALL: Super real.

23:30.133 --> 23:31.867
>> KHLOE: Yeah.
>> KENDALL: Hi.

23:31.867 --> 23:33.767
>> TARAN: Hi. How are you?
>> KENDALL: How are you?

23:33.767 --> 23:35.533
>> TARAN: Hi. I'm Taran.
>> KENDALL: Kendall.

23:35.533 --> 23:37.266
>> TARAN: Nice to meet you.
>> KHLOE: Hi. I'm Khloe.

23:37.266 --> 23:39.700
>> TARAN: So you guys, what's
your guys' thoughts on why you

23:39.700 --> 23:41.667
want to do this?
>> KHLOE: We want to learn how

23:41.667 --> 23:44.867
to be comfortable with a gun.
Kendall's been robbed before,

23:44.867 --> 23:49.200
and we just want to protect
ourselves.

23:49.200 --> 23:53.400
I know Kim is so against us
getting guns, but for Kendall

23:53.400 --> 23:56.367
and I, it's something that we
feel like we need to do in order

23:56.367 --> 23:59.133
for us to sleep better at night.
And I think Kim will respect it

23:59.133 --> 24:03.000
more if she sees later how much
work and effort and

24:03.000 --> 24:06.000
responsibility we put into this.
>> TARAN: So, let me show you

24:06.000 --> 24:08.100
some of the main things.
I think it's great that you guys

24:08.100 --> 24:10.834
want to know how to handle this
stuff because, you know, even

24:10.834 --> 24:13.266
if you're totally not into guns,
you hate guns, you're at some

24:13.266 --> 24:17.166
party and someone's, "I found my
dad's gun. Cool, dude."

24:17.166 --> 24:19.967
It's like, "Well, it's empty."
You take the mag out.

24:19.967 --> 24:22.867
It's not empty.
The way these guns work is: take

24:22.867 --> 24:26.100
the mag out, it will fire right
now.

24:26.100 --> 24:28.800
So, there could still be one in
the chamber of the gun.

24:28.800 --> 24:31.000
And you can save a life.
A lot of people have been killed

24:31.000 --> 24:33.233
from not knowing there's still
one in the chamber.

24:33.233 --> 24:35.667
So, we get past that part, I
want to show you, like, the

24:35.667 --> 24:37.667
proper grip and stance.
As long as you got as much skin

24:37.667 --> 24:40.033
on the gun as possible, you're
controlling the gun.

24:40.033 --> 24:41.867
It's not controlling you.
>> KHLOE: Like that?

24:41.867 --> 24:43.934
>> TARAN: Yeah. That's perfect.
All right, now shove the mag in

24:43.934 --> 24:45.967
the bottom.
Good, it's in.

24:45.967 --> 24:47.700
Now hit that lever straight
down.

24:47.700 --> 24:49.800
We're gonna shoot this rubber
dummy guy right here.

24:49.800 --> 24:51.767
Good, have that forward,
upper-body, aggressive stance.

24:51.767 --> 24:54.133
Go ahead and shoot a shot.
>> KENDALL: Oh!

24:54.133 --> 24:56.667
>> TARAN: Good. Did you see
where it hit?

24:56.667 --> 25:01.500
Good. Just keep shooting.
>> KENDALL: I can't believe

25:01.500 --> 25:06.166
Khloe, like, jumps into this and
is so comfortable.

25:06.166 --> 25:10.734
>> TARAN: Good. Good.
>> KENDALL: I've obviously been

25:10.734 --> 25:14.500
to a shooting range before, but
it's literally scaring me so

25:14.500 --> 25:19.700
bad, I'm hiding behind the wall.
>> KOURTNEY (laughing): It's not

25:19.700 --> 25:23.066
funny, honestly.
(both laugh)

25:23.066 --> 25:25.100
>> KOURTNEY: Do you even like
dogs?

25:25.100 --> 25:28.233
>> KIM: Who found them?
>> KOURTNEY: You hate dogs.

25:28.233 --> 25:30.233
>> KENDALL: Um, we just have
something we want to talk to you

25:30.233 --> 25:38.100
about.
>> KIM: Oh, God, what?

25:38.100 --> 25:42.433
(birds singing and squawking)
>> TARAN: Go ahead.

25:42.433 --> 25:44.433
Perfect.
>> KHLOE: Whoa!

25:44.433 --> 25:46.433
>> TARAN: Awesome.
>> WOMAN: Good job.

25:46.433 --> 25:48.200
There we go.
>> KHLOE: Oh, my God, are you

25:48.200 --> 25:50.000
okay?
>> KENDALL: I'm not gonna be

25:50.000 --> 25:51.767
that good.
>> KHLOE: It's okay.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.667
>> TARAN: You'll do great.
>> KHLOE: Yeah, you're so good.

25:53.667 --> 25:55.400
You get, like, adrenaline,
Kendall.

25:55.400 --> 25:57.600
>> KENDALL: Okay.
>> TARAN: You'll do great.

25:57.600 --> 26:00.734
Okay, let's get your grip down.
Lean more into it now.

26:00.734 --> 26:03.000
And we're gonna shoot right here
on this-this guy.

26:03.000 --> 26:04.734
Watch the green dot and squeeze.
(Kendall shrieks)

26:04.734 --> 26:06.767
>> TARAN: That was not-- not a
big deal, right?

26:06.767 --> 26:08.700
Lean more into it.
On the balls of your feet.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.934
Don't let the gun push you
around.

26:10.934 --> 26:16.533
Do it again.
Good. Aim a little bit lower.

26:16.533 --> 26:18.533
>> KHLOE: You did so good.
>> KENDALL: I'm sweating.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.533
I haven't hit anything, have I?
>> KHLOE: Kendall...

26:20.533 --> 26:22.500
>> TARAN: You hit everything.
>> KHLOE: You hit him... all

26:22.500 --> 26:25.233
those black dots.
>> KENDALL: Oh.

26:25.233 --> 26:27.700
>> KHLOE: I'm super happy that
Kendall and I went to the gun

26:27.700 --> 26:31.867
range, and I feel truly educated
on holding a gun, how to load a

26:31.867 --> 26:34.266
gun.
I'm proud that we did that.

26:34.266 --> 26:36.400
This was so fun, weirdly.
>> KENDALL: Thanks a bunch.

26:36.400 --> 26:38.400
>> TARAN: Hope you had fun.
>> KHLOE: Thank you, guys!

26:38.400 --> 26:42.467
I'm happy I feel comfortable
around a gun.

26:42.467 --> 26:45.133
How educational was that?
so

26:45.133 --> 26:46.667
educational.
>> KHLOE: Babe.

26:46.667 --> 26:48.500
>> MAN: You look like that girl
or

26:48.500 --> 26:50.500
something.
>> KHLOE: Short hair, don't

26:50.500 --> 26:55.066
care.
Red lip.

26:55.066 --> 26:58.433
>> KOURTNEY: Kim?
Where is my dog?

26:58.433 --> 27:02.033
This is not funny anymore.
>> KIM: How did you even know I

27:02.033 --> 27:04.533
was home? Freak.
>> KOURTNEY: I have my sources.

27:04.533 --> 27:07.400
>> KIM: Who? My assistant?
>> KOURTNEY: Can't tell.

27:07.400 --> 27:10.700
Never reveal the source.
Give me my dog.

27:10.700 --> 27:13.000
Like, why don't you want me to
get the dog back?

27:13.000 --> 27:15.467
(Sushi barking)
All your dog does is bark all

27:15.467 --> 27:18.100
day.
>> KIM: I know. Yours is so much

27:18.100 --> 27:20.967
more calm.
>> KOURTNEY: It's not funny.

27:20.967 --> 27:24.800
Honestly.
(both laughing)

27:24.800 --> 27:26.967
>> KIM: I swear, she likes me
better now.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.100
She's, like, adjusted.
Look how calm she is.

27:29.100 --> 27:34.767
You're not getting her back.
(laughing)

27:34.767 --> 27:38.133
>> KOURTNEY: It's not funny.
This is not your dog.

27:38.133 --> 27:40.133
Do you even like dogs?
>> KIM: Who found them?

27:40.133 --> 27:42.133
>> KOURTNEY: You hate dogs.
>> KIM: Am I sitting here with

27:42.133 --> 27:44.867
the dog?
>> KOURTNEY: It's Penelope's.

27:44.867 --> 27:47.100
It's not yours.
>> KIM: Penelope has no idea.

27:47.100 --> 27:49.100
>> KOURTNEY: Yes, she does.
>> KIM: She has no idea.

27:49.100 --> 27:52.333
>> KOURTNEY: She loves her dog.
>> KIM: Look at how cute she is.

27:52.333 --> 27:56.533
"Don't take me. Don't."
(Sushi barking)

27:56.533 --> 27:59.567
>> KOURTNEY: Give her to me.
It's not funny.

27:59.567 --> 28:01.967
>> KIM: Yeah, and your poor
dog's locked up in a cage.

28:01.967 --> 28:04.500
I think Khloe would die if we
had a... Aah!

28:04.500 --> 28:08.367
>> KOURTNEY: I got you, Honey
buns, watch.

28:08.367 --> 28:14.233
Honey buns.
>> KIM: Hi, good old Sush.

28:14.233 --> 28:18.600
Uh, that's my cage.
Freak.

28:18.600 --> 28:21.934
(sighs) I mean, whatever.
I guess she can have her dog

28:21.934 --> 28:24.867
back, and I will just have to
deal with Sushi's barking

28:24.867 --> 28:32.000
forever, I guess.
Sushi, you bark one time...

28:32.000 --> 28:35.367
(with accent): ...and we're
going to have a problem.

28:35.367 --> 28:38.433
Okay?

other day and brought me a
Mixmaster she insisted I put on

29:13.834 --> 29:16.100
the counter.
And I told her, I said, "Well, I

29:16.100 --> 29:18.767
don't use them, but you can put
it there if you want."

29:18.767 --> 29:21.533

get rid of all the stuff here.

And full access to unsecured

>> KIM: ...calm dog-- I'm sure
that's what everyone wants,

39:03.300 --> 39:05.300
right?
>> CESAR: Yeah, well, that has

39:05.300 --> 39:09.133
to do with structure.
(Sushi barking)

39:09.133 --> 39:11.767
>> KIM: He's gonna teach us.
>> CESAR: Yeah, I'm gonna show

39:11.767 --> 39:14.000
you a little bit, just very
basic stuff.

39:14.000 --> 39:16.700
>> KIM: I am so excited to meet
Cesar.

39:16.700 --> 39:20.000
He obviously knows what he's
doing, and I'm so excited for

39:20.000 --> 39:25.266
him to just meet our dog and
see, you know, tricks and tips

39:25.266 --> 39:28.400
that we can learn to really help
train Sushi.

39:28.400 --> 39:31.000
I have to show you this.
I'll put on these shoes, and

39:31.000 --> 39:33.700
you'll see what she does to me.
I get it-- they're fur.

39:33.700 --> 39:35.700
>> CESAR: Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

39:35.700 --> 39:37.700
>> KIM: Aah!
Like, I literally...

39:37.700 --> 39:40.233
They're my most comfy slippers,
so if I have to get rid of them,

39:40.233 --> 39:42.233
I will, but it's...
(Sushi barking, growling)

39:42.233 --> 39:45.300
Okay, come on.
>> CESAR: Oh, that's bad.

39:45.300 --> 39:47.533
That's-that's too far.
Yeah, that's...

39:47.533 --> 39:52.000
>> KIM: Northie, there you go.
>> CESAR: You just rewarded it.

39:52.000 --> 39:53.900
Yeah, this is pretty bad.

39:58.066 --> 40:00.867
(Sushi yapping)
>> CESAR: That's-that's too far.

40:00.867 --> 40:02.867
>> KIM: Look, Northie.
>> CESAR: That eventually can be

40:02.867 --> 40:05.600
bad.
>> KIM: There you go.

40:05.600 --> 40:08.300
>> CESAR: You just rewarded it.
Yeah, this is pretty bad.

40:08.300 --> 40:10.133
It's chasing right now, see?
>> KIM: Yeah.

40:10.133 --> 40:12.300
>> CESAR: Looks cute in the
beginning, but eventually it's

40:12.300 --> 40:14.600
painful, so we have to make sure
that she does this, or he does

40:14.600 --> 40:18.500
the same thing, but to something
that is more his own, like toys,

40:18.500 --> 40:20.533
but that's not a toy.
>> NORTH: I gave my dog the dog

40:20.533 --> 40:24.834
toy.
>> KIM: Oh, she likes it.

40:24.834 --> 40:26.834
>> CESAR: She likes it, but
she's guarding it.

40:26.834 --> 40:29.700
So, one thing is retrieving,
meaning they bring it to you.

40:29.700 --> 40:33.500
When they go grab it and take it
away, what they're saying, "This

40:33.500 --> 40:36.266
is mine."
So if you go get it, that's when

40:36.266 --> 40:38.266
the-- (growls)-- growl begins.
>> KIM: Yeah, she's not, like,

40:38.266 --> 40:40.133
a "fetch" kind of dog, so...
>> CESAR: You have to trigger

40:40.133 --> 40:41.500
that.
>> KIM: Yeah.

40:41.500 --> 40:43.834
>> CESAR: In some breeds, it's
natural-- Labradors.

40:43.834 --> 40:46.266
In other breeds, you have to
trigger bringing things back.

40:46.266 --> 40:48.834
>> KIM: Can you go get my phone,
Sushi?

40:48.834 --> 40:50.834
>> CESAR (laughing): Kind of.
>> KIM: Not gonna convince her

40:50.834 --> 40:53.233
to do that. (laughs)
>> CESAR: And then we can work

40:53.233 --> 40:55.133
on that.
(Sushi growling)

40:55.133 --> 40:58.266
What you have done is he's
getting a reward for chasing it.

40:58.266 --> 41:00.300
So she's not understanding to
leave the shoe alone.

41:00.300 --> 41:03.300
So before you actually wear 'em,
teach them to leave them alone.

41:03.300 --> 41:04.967
(snaps fingers)
Shh.

41:04.967 --> 41:07.000
There.
>> KIM: Wow, she's not

41:07.000 --> 41:09.000
interested.
>> CESAR: You want to try it?

41:09.000 --> 41:11.000
>> KIM: Sure.
>> CESAR: Yeah.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.667
>> KIM: So...
(snaps fingers)

41:12.667 --> 41:15.633
Shh.
>> CESAR: There you go. Shh.

41:15.633 --> 41:18.600
So it's learning now with the--
shh-- with the shoes on.

41:18.600 --> 41:20.900
If she's not doing it, we don't
use the sound.

41:20.900 --> 41:23.266
Shh.
Right there.

41:23.266 --> 41:26.734
>> KIM: Shh.
>> CESAR: D-Don't move away, uh,

41:26.734 --> 41:29.633
she has to move.
Shh.

41:29.633 --> 41:34.100
There you go.
>> KIM: Ooh, that was a good

41:34.100 --> 41:38.333
one.
>> CESAR: There you go.

41:38.333 --> 41:40.367
You get it?
>> KIM: Mm-hmm.

41:40.367 --> 41:42.500
>> CESAR: What you're gonna see,
by her having more rules and

41:42.500 --> 41:45.000
boundaries, she's gonna calm
down.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.600
(Sushi barks)
You need to work on the proper

41:47.600 --> 41:50.333
way to drain energy.
Right now the energy is all over

41:50.333 --> 41:52.033
the place, so your house becomes
like Chuck E. Cheese.

41:52.033 --> 41:54.033
>> KIM: I think even just going
on walks with the kids...

41:54.033 --> 41:56.233
>> CESAR: Oh, totally.
>> KIM: ...would be, like, key.

41:56.233 --> 41:58.734
>> CESAR: I'm gonna put a leash,
so you can see the shift.

41:58.734 --> 42:01.533
Okay, so right now, this is,
uh, yeah, she-she is going

42:01.533 --> 42:05.567
though a very playful state.
So watch how a foreign object

42:05.567 --> 42:10.367
changes the state of mind.
>> KIM: Sushi bushi.

42:10.367 --> 42:14.266
>> CESAR: All right, so what
we're looking for is for her--

42:14.266 --> 42:17.967
that once she wears this-this
object, for the mind to calm

42:17.967 --> 42:20.834
down.
As soon as she settles, we take

42:20.834 --> 42:23.834
the leash off, and the-the
lesson stops.

42:23.834 --> 42:27.867
(Sushi yaps)
Shh.

42:27.867 --> 42:30.033
There you go.
That's what I was looking for.

42:30.033 --> 42:32.900
Always release them when they're
in a calm state.

42:32.900 --> 42:34.900
>> KIM: Okay.
>> CESAR: So what did you learn

42:34.900 --> 42:36.900
today, Kim?
>> KIM: I definitely learned to

42:36.900 --> 42:39.066
be, like, more...
Hey! No.

42:39.066 --> 42:41.133
>> CESAR: There you go.
>> KIM: More of, like, the

42:41.133 --> 42:44.400
authority, instead of just
running along with it and

42:44.400 --> 42:46.934
letting her bite it, and just
giving her my shoe.

42:46.934 --> 42:49.900
She's like a kid.
You really do have to spend the

42:49.900 --> 42:53.767
time, like, going out on the
walks.

42:53.767 --> 42:58.133
It's really exciting to know
that Sushi's, you know, issues

42:58.133 --> 43:01.934
are fixable, and she's just a
part of the family now, so we

43:01.934 --> 43:04.467
just... we got to work on it.
>> NORTH: Dogs can eat chicken.

43:04.467 --> 43:06.567
>> CESAR: That's one of their
favorites.

43:06.567 --> 43:08.567
>> KIM: You know what she just
doesn't eat?

43:08.567 --> 43:11.200
Sushi doesn't eat sushi.
Isn't that silly?

43:11.200 --> 43:13.967
(Sushi barks)
Shh!

43:13.967 --> 43:17.133
On the next episode...
Top secret, my surrogate passed

43:17.133 --> 43:20.233
all of her tests.
We'll just try one embryo.

43:20.233 --> 43:23.633
You know, it's only a 60% chance
that it'll take.

43:23.633 --> 43:25.633
>> KHLOE: That's so scary.
>> KIM: Yeah.

43:25.633 --> 43:27.734
>> KHLOE: I see you online going
out every night.

43:27.734 --> 43:31.400
Who were you with?
She won't even say his name.

43:31.400 --> 43:33.667
Like, let's say his name now.
>> KIM: She doesn't say anything

43:33.667 --> 43:35.100
about it.
>> KHLOE: You're not (bleep)

43:35.100 --> 43:37.100
saying the name, that's so
(bleep) stupid.

43:37.100 --> 43:38.967
>> KOURTNEY: So say the (bleep)
name, but shut the (bleep) up.
