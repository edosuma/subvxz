00:21.938 --> 00:23.897
Mitch?

00:24.065 --> 00:26.066
Ashley?

00:26.234 --> 00:28.110
You out here?

00:35.118 --> 00:36.618
Come on, guys.

00:36.786 --> 00:38.662
Where are you?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.792
Hello?

00:45.462 --> 00:47.254
Hello?

00:52.886 --> 00:55.220
- Brodie.
- Ashley and Todd, they're dead.

00:55.388 --> 00:56.555
Wendy, they're dead.

00:56.723 --> 00:59.433
Pull it together.
- Pull it together? We don't have a chance.

00:59.601 --> 01:02.144
- We have to get out of here.
- No, we are not leaving.

01:02.312 --> 01:04.563
- We have got to find my sister.
- No.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.316
- No, I am getting out of here right now.
- Brodie!

01:07.484 --> 01:10.235
Brodie get back here! Brodie!

01:10.403 --> 01:12.780
God, you son of a bitch.

01:36.346 --> 01:38.347
Cut. What the hell was that?

01:41.184 --> 01:42.434
Thanks.

01:44.270 --> 01:46.188
Here you go.
- Thanks, Walter.

01:46.356 --> 01:48.482
McG:
Don't mark that.

01:50.318 --> 01:53.028
It's all good, Tara. That was great.

01:53.196 --> 01:54.196
Uh, let's do it again.

01:54.697 --> 01:58.200
Uh, maybe we try dialing up
that scream, huh?

01:58.368 --> 02:01.453
I know, I know. I'm just--
I'm having trouble with the tennis ball.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.539
Oh, you know what?
That is for CG registration.

02:03.706 --> 02:07.209
Now, when Ivan and the FX guys
are done, it is going to look terrifying.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.464
- Wanna look at the concept sketches again?
- No, that's okay. I'll find it, I'll find it.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.383
I know you will, huh? Okay.

02:14.551 --> 02:20.180
Going again, everybody.
Ten-minute reload for camera and sound.

02:20.348 --> 02:24.476
Wow, man. I'm telling you, working alone
behind the sets or after wrap...

02:24.644 --> 02:27.062
- Yeah.
- ...I catch this weird vibe sometimes.

02:27.230 --> 02:29.064
Oh, like what?

02:29.232 --> 02:30.482
Like something's watching.

02:31.818 --> 02:33.735
- Come on.
- Hey...

02:33.903 --> 02:37.906
...working on a movie like this,
weird crap's bound to happen.

02:38.074 --> 02:41.577
Frankie thinks the stage is haunted.
Like, for real.

02:42.162 --> 02:47.332
All I'm saying is, they call wrap,
I get done and I get out of here.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.669
Fast.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.260
That guy is definitely off his meds.

03:00.305 --> 03:02.264
Whoo.

03:03.266 --> 03:05.350
Brodie, come back.

03:05.518 --> 03:06.727
You son of a bitch.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.486
Brodie, come back, you son of a bitch.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.743
Hello?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.459
Guys?

03:35.298 --> 03:37.257
Come on, it's not funny.

03:39.219 --> 03:40.302
Okay.

03:40.470 --> 03:42.012
Ha-ha. Very funny.

03:47.977 --> 03:49.645
Hello?

03:52.315 --> 03:54.024
Who's there?

04:13.127 --> 04:15.504
Now, that's what I'm talking about.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.022
First opened in 1927...

04:34.190 --> 04:36.775
...the lot has been
in continuous operation...

04:36.943 --> 04:38.735
...for eight decades.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.613
Hey, you know this is where
they filmed Creepshow?

04:44.951 --> 04:47.286
Now, to the right here is Stars Hollow.

04:47.453 --> 04:51.248
It's the setting for the television series
Gilmore Girls.

04:51.416 --> 04:54.376
And if we're lucky,
we might even catch...

04:54.711 --> 04:56.753
...one of the show's stars.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.046
Come on.

04:58.214 --> 04:59.464
Let's finish the tour.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.466
And then up to the right here we have...

05:02.176 --> 05:06.513
...New York Avenue, and that's where
they shot Lois and Clark.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.895
Sam, check it out, it's Matt Damon.

05:14.522 --> 05:17.024
- Yeah, pretty sure that's not Matt Damon.
- No, it is.

05:17.191 --> 05:20.068
Well, Matt Damon just picked up
a broom and started sweeping.

05:20.236 --> 05:22.237
Well, he's probably researching
a role or something.

05:22.405 --> 05:24.740
Uh, I don't think so.

05:24.907 --> 05:27.576
Hey, this way.
Uh, I think Stage 9's over here.

05:27.744 --> 05:30.537
- Come on, man. Let's keep going this way.
- No, come on, we gotta work.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.082
You wanted to come to L.A.
Yeah, for vacation.

05:34.250 --> 05:37.127
I mean, swimming pools
and movie stars. Not to work.

05:37.295 --> 05:39.880
Does this seem like swimming-pool
weather to you, Dean?

05:40.048 --> 05:42.591
- I mean, it's practically Canadian.
- Yeah.

05:42.759 --> 05:45.594
I just figured that after everything
that happened with...

05:45.762 --> 05:48.055
...Madison, you could use
a little R and R.

05:48.222 --> 05:50.724
Well, maybe I wanna work.
It keeps my mind off things.

05:50.892 --> 05:52.684
Okay. Okay. All right.

05:52.852 --> 05:55.312
So this crew guy, what did he--?
He died on set?

05:55.480 --> 05:58.607
Yeah, rumor's spreading
like wildfire online.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.692
They're saying the set's haunted.

06:00.860 --> 06:02.486
What, like Poltergeist?

06:02.653 --> 06:06.156
- Could be a poltergeist.
- No, no, no. The movie Poltergeist.

06:06.324 --> 06:09.201
You know nothing
of your cultural heritage, do you?

06:09.369 --> 06:11.995
It was rumored that the set
of Poltergeist was cursed.

06:12.163 --> 06:15.374
That they used real human bones
as, uh, props.

06:15.541 --> 06:18.627
Like, at least three of the actors
died in it.

06:18.795 --> 06:21.254
Yeah, it might be something like that.

06:21.422 --> 06:23.799
- So this crew guy, what's his name?
- Frank Jaffy.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.927
Frank Jaffy, you got a death certificate
or a coroner's report?

06:27.095 --> 06:30.680
Well, no, but, uh, it's L.A., you know?
Might not even be his real name.

06:30.848 --> 06:33.392
But the girl who found him,
she said she saw something.

06:33.559 --> 06:34.643
A vanishing figure.

06:34.811 --> 06:36.645
- What's the girl's name?
- Uh, Tara Benchley.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.438
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Tara Benchley?

06:39.190 --> 06:41.691
From FeardotCom
and Ghost Ship, Tara Benchley?

06:41.859 --> 06:43.443
Dude, why didn't you say so?

06:44.153 --> 06:46.738
Well, so now you're suddenly onboard?

06:47.865 --> 06:50.033
I'm just-- I mean, I'm a fan of her work.

06:50.827 --> 06:52.494
It's very good.

06:55.039 --> 06:57.833
Look, don't get me wrong.
Everyone at the studio loves the dailies.

06:58.000 --> 07:01.545
Myself included.
We were just wondering if it could be...

07:01.712 --> 07:03.422
...you know, a little brighter.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.716
- Brighter?
- Yeah, Jay. More color.

07:07.135 --> 07:09.719
McG, you know what I'm saying.
You're the master.

07:09.887 --> 07:13.265
- Brad, this is a horror movie.
- And who says horror has to be dark?

07:13.433 --> 07:16.101
It's just-- It's sort of depressing.
Don't you think?

07:16.269 --> 07:18.979
Uh, excuse me, uh, green-shirt guy.

07:19.147 --> 07:20.939
Yeah, yeah, you, come here.

07:22.525 --> 07:24.151
Could you get me a...

07:24.318 --> 07:25.569
...uh, smoothie from craft?

07:27.196 --> 07:28.655
You want a what from who?

07:30.032 --> 07:33.076
You are a PA. This is what you do.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.370
Yeah, yeah, he, uh...

07:35.538 --> 07:36.997
One smoothie coming right up.

07:41.210 --> 07:44.421
- What's a PA?
- I think they're kind of like slaves.

07:47.049 --> 07:49.885
They'll let anybody
into this business, huh?

07:51.053 --> 07:52.888
Got it?
Yeah.

07:53.347 --> 07:56.224
- Yeah, one of the grips left that.
That's good right there.

07:56.392 --> 07:59.352
Hey, guys. Come here.
All right, let's go, people.

07:59.520 --> 08:00.520
Thanks, man.

08:00.688 --> 08:03.231
So when Tara's saying her lines,
can I step forward...

08:03.399 --> 08:06.902
- ...and make this new spot my new mark?
McG: Sure, sure, sure, treat yourself.

08:07.069 --> 08:09.529
- Go ahead.
Quiet, please.

08:18.039 --> 08:19.539
Quiet, hold the bell.

08:19.707 --> 08:21.041
Lights.

08:21.209 --> 08:22.834
Hold the noise, we're rolling.

08:24.795 --> 08:26.505
Six, take six. Mark.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.050
Frame.

08:30.218 --> 08:34.011
McG: Why don't we take it from
"Come on, it'll be fun." And action.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.640
Come on, it'll be fun.

09:09.590 --> 09:11.299
McG:
Maybe you can finish this tomorrow?

09:11.467 --> 09:13.051
- I hate you so much right now.
- Cut.

09:14.387 --> 09:16.096
Very nice.

09:16.264 --> 09:17.305
Ready to go again.

09:17.473 --> 09:20.225
So?
- No EMF anywhere.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.810
Great. So, what do you think?

09:21.978 --> 09:24.854
Well, I think being a PA sucks.

09:25.815 --> 09:29.150
But the food these people get,
are you kidding me? Look at these things.

09:29.986 --> 09:33.863
They're like miniature Philly cheesesteak
sandwiches. Their delicious.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.575
Maybe later.

09:38.744 --> 09:41.246
What did you find out about
the dead crew guy?

09:44.375 --> 09:46.501
Uh, Frank Jaffy
was just filling in for the day.

09:46.669 --> 09:48.587
Nobody here knew him or where he lived.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.880
Oh, great. So you found out
as much as I did.

09:51.048 --> 09:52.340
- Not quite I--
Hey, guys.

09:52.508 --> 09:53.842
Hey.
Oh, hey.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.510
They're wonderful.

09:55.678 --> 09:58.138
Listen, I did dig up some stuff
about Stage 9's history.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.556
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.516
Four people died messy here
over 80 years.

10:01.684 --> 10:03.435
Two suicides and two fatal accidents.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.771
- Any of those could be a vengeful spirit.
- Yeah.

10:06.939 --> 10:08.273
Just gotta narrow it down more.

10:14.196 --> 10:15.322
I'll get right on that.

10:18.576 --> 10:21.411
I won't say anything.
We've got about four changes.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.912
Hey!

10:27.209 --> 10:29.377
Are you supposed to get one of these?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.801
I don't really know what I'm doing so--

10:37.386 --> 10:38.386
First day?

10:38.554 --> 10:40.930
Yeah, my big break.

10:42.850 --> 10:46.728
You know, I know it's really uncool
to say this, but I'm a big fan.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.104
I loved you in Boogeyman.

10:48.272 --> 10:50.649
Oh, God. What a terrible script.

10:51.400 --> 10:54.319
- Uh, but thank you.
Yeah.

10:56.739 --> 10:59.866
You found him, right, the dead guy?

11:04.246 --> 11:06.748
I'm sorry, you probably don't
wanna talk about this.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.208
No, actually it's--

11:08.376 --> 11:12.045
It's okay, but nobody around here
really brings it up very much.

11:12.213 --> 11:15.507
I think they're all scared I'm gonna have
some kind of breakdown.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.342
That must have been awful.

11:20.638 --> 11:21.680
What happened?

11:22.098 --> 11:23.640
It was horrible.

11:24.100 --> 11:28.561
There-- There was all this blood
coming from his eyes...

11:28.729 --> 11:31.940
...and from his mouth, and, uh...

11:32.817 --> 11:34.901
I saw this, um...

11:37.571 --> 11:38.947
What?

11:41.867 --> 11:43.118
I saw this shape.

11:44.620 --> 11:47.038
To tell you the truth,
I don't know actually...

11:47.206 --> 11:49.290
...what I saw. I just know I saw it.

11:49.458 --> 11:51.793
Here you go, Tara.
Thanks, Walter.

11:54.463 --> 11:58.967
Uh, so this crew guy, Frank.
I mean, did you know him?

11:59.135 --> 12:00.593
Uh, no. Not that well.

12:00.761 --> 12:03.888
That's funny. It's like no one around here
actually knew the guy.

12:04.056 --> 12:06.933
- I've got his picture. Um...
- You do?

12:07.101 --> 12:09.978
Yeah, I take Polaroid's
of all the crew.

12:10.146 --> 12:12.814
It's just one of those things you do
to kill time on set.

12:12.982 --> 12:14.482
- Yeah.
Um...

12:15.151 --> 12:17.652
Um, right there.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.951
Son of a bitch.

12:32.501 --> 12:34.794
- Gerard St. James?
- Yes.

12:34.962 --> 12:36.129
You're still alive.

12:36.297 --> 12:39.007
- And you're not Frank Jaffy.
Uh, no.

12:39.175 --> 12:43.595
You were Desert Soldier #4
in Metalstorm: Destruction of Jared-Syn?

12:43.763 --> 12:45.972
- I was.
I knew I recognized you.

12:46.515 --> 12:48.808
I am a huge fan. Ha-ha.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.352
Your turn as a tractor-crash
victim in Critters 3?

12:51.520 --> 12:52.562
- Critters 3.
- Wow.

12:53.189 --> 12:55.982
- Yeah.
- All right, well, please. Come in.

12:56.150 --> 12:57.859
Oh, cool.

13:04.825 --> 13:05.825
Thanks.

13:05.993 --> 13:09.871
Yeah, it was the producers. I mean, they
brought me in for the day to play Frank.

13:10.039 --> 13:13.792
- Just to fake your death?
- Well, rumors of a haunted film set.

13:13.959 --> 13:17.378
Free publicity. Especially
when you're making a horror movie.

13:17.546 --> 13:20.340
I mean, uh, it's already
all over the Internet.

13:20.508 --> 13:22.008
Yeah, we know.

13:22.176 --> 13:26.679
Well, these days, it's all about new media.
Building buzz.

13:26.847 --> 13:28.097
They say...

13:28.265 --> 13:30.308
...I'm the new Lonelygirl.

13:30.726 --> 13:33.061
- Who?
- And the ghost Tara saw?

13:33.229 --> 13:35.605
Projected on a screen of diffusion.

13:37.024 --> 13:39.943
Isn't that kind of cruel?
Messing with their heads like that?

13:40.110 --> 13:43.321
Hey, I just play the part.
I don't write the script.

13:43.864 --> 13:47.534
Speaking of, I'm playing Willy...

13:47.701 --> 13:51.246
...in a dinner-theater production
of Salesman at Costa Mesa all next month.

13:52.414 --> 13:54.624
You get a free pepper steak
with the coupon.

13:54.792 --> 13:56.042
Ha.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.003
Well, if you're seen in public,
won't that ruin the hoax?

13:59.171 --> 14:00.755
Please. Ha.

14:00.923 --> 14:03.591
Frank and Willy,
totally different characters.

14:04.426 --> 14:05.802
You know what?

14:05.970 --> 14:09.264
Thanks very much, Mr. St. James.
It was just nagging at us, you know.

14:09.431 --> 14:11.182
But we're very glad that, you know...

14:11.350 --> 14:13.768
...you're alive and well.

14:13.936 --> 14:15.603
Yeah.

14:16.772 --> 14:18.231
Absolutely.

14:18.399 --> 14:22.569
Hey, uh, I wanted to ask you,
what was it like working with Richard Moll?

14:26.156 --> 14:30.785
Metalstorm. He was Hurok,
king of the Cyclops people.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.538
Gentleman's gentleman.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.373
Yeah? Ha-ha.

14:35.958 --> 14:38.126
All right. Pepper steak.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.382
When we read from that book,
we must've brought them back.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.550
Back from hell.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.430
It doesn't matter.

14:50.598 --> 14:53.850
We're not going anywhere until we
find Wendy and her sister. Got it?

14:54.018 --> 14:56.811
Good. Now, let's get busy.

14:56.979 --> 14:57.979
Cut.

14:58.147 --> 14:59.314
Very nice work. Mark it.

14:59.481 --> 15:01.524
No good for sound.
I'm getting some kind of feedback.

15:01.692 --> 15:04.068
Ugh. Back to one.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.446
Another costly sound delay.

15:06.614 --> 15:10.283
- We're going again for sound, people.
- Thank you.

15:10.451 --> 15:13.703
No, no, no, look, see, it's great scene.
Really. Dynamite...

15:13.871 --> 15:17.624
...but I still got a few--
Not-- Not problems, just questions.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.500
Like what?

15:19.668 --> 15:20.710
Well, for one thing...

15:22.046 --> 15:23.713
...the rules aren't really landing for me.

15:23.881 --> 15:28.968
Like, the kids do this Latin chant
and that makes the ghost show up?

15:29.136 --> 15:30.136
Yeah.

15:30.304 --> 15:33.097
See, but if the ghosts are in hell,
how do they hear the chanting?

15:33.265 --> 15:35.767
I mean, what,
do they have super hearing?

15:35.935 --> 15:38.686
Well, it's a logic bump.
The rules don't track.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.481
Marty, you're the writer.

15:41.649 --> 15:43.149
What if I throw in an explainer?

15:43.317 --> 15:46.235
Yeah, that'd be super. Excuse me,
I gotta check some messages.

15:48.864 --> 15:50.740
Suits.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.591
Has McG seen this?

16:08.759 --> 16:14.055
I like the whole body-paint,
black-and-white thing, but, gee...

16:14.223 --> 16:18.142
...I don't think those neck wounds
are really gonna read on camera.

16:18.310 --> 16:20.269
They need to be red.

16:20.437 --> 16:21.980
You know what I'm saying?

16:22.147 --> 16:24.732
Hey, Jay? I need you to speak
to Makeup right away.

16:27.987 --> 16:29.445
Yeah?

16:48.257 --> 16:49.799
Wait up.

16:49.967 --> 16:53.094
When we read from that book,
we must've brought them back.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.595
Back from hell.

16:54.763 --> 16:58.057
But I don't understand. If they
were in hell, how could they hear?

16:58.225 --> 16:59.600
They must have super hearing.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.853
McG:
What the--? Whoa!

17:04.565 --> 17:06.773
Oh, jeez. Oh--

17:38.474 --> 17:41.434
Wendy.
- Oh, Mitch. God, you're alive.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.311
You couldn't get rid of me that easy.

17:43.479 --> 17:45.271
McG:
Rumble, rumble, rumble!

17:46.190 --> 17:48.149
Salt. Okay, we need salt.

17:48.317 --> 17:51.152
I read in that book that it keeps
ghosts away.

17:51.320 --> 17:54.197
Sandra, Logan, you guys check the back.

17:54.364 --> 17:56.240
Jay, the poor bastard killed himself...

17:56.408 --> 17:59.035
...like, for real.
Shouldn't we shut it down or something?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.871
We had a moment
of silence for him at breakfast.

18:02.039 --> 18:03.581
He was just a studio guy. Come on.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.166
McG:
Shh.

18:05.334 --> 18:08.127
I love you.
I know.

18:09.004 --> 18:10.004
I'm sorry.

18:12.049 --> 18:14.342
Can we--? Can we cut or something?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.012
Uh, uh, yeah, cut. Cut!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.680
That's a cut.

18:22.810 --> 18:24.018
Only I can say, "cut."

18:25.813 --> 18:27.230
Hey, what's up?

18:27.397 --> 18:29.148
I'm sorry, I'm just a little upset.

18:29.316 --> 18:32.860
With everything that's been going on
around here, who can blame you, huh?

18:33.028 --> 18:35.363
I just can't wrap my head around
the dialogue.

18:35.531 --> 18:37.865
You know, salt?
Doesn't that sound silly?

18:38.033 --> 18:40.201
I mean, why would a ghost
be afraid of salt?

18:40.369 --> 18:42.411
McG:
Okay, um...

18:42.579 --> 18:43.579
- Marty.
Yo.

18:43.747 --> 18:45.248
What do you think?

18:45.415 --> 18:48.543
I'm not married to salt. What do you want?
We still sticking with condiments?

18:48.710 --> 18:51.420
McG:
Mm, just sounds different. Not better.

18:51.588 --> 18:54.841
- What else would a ghost be scared of?
- Uh, you gotta be kidding me.

18:55.843 --> 18:57.301
What would a ghost be scared of?

18:57.469 --> 19:00.138
Maybe, uh-- Maybe shotguns.

19:00.305 --> 19:02.014
Okay, that makes
even less sense than salt.

19:03.892 --> 19:06.060
These people are idiots.

19:08.647 --> 19:12.608
- Walter's a little testy for a PA, huh?
- How's it going in here?

19:12.776 --> 19:15.194
It's going good. Tara's stepped up
her performance.

19:15.362 --> 19:17.947
Probably from all the sense memory
she's drawing on.

19:18.115 --> 19:19.866
- Sense memory?
- Yeah.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.912
When I ask how it's going here,
I'm talking about the case, right?

19:25.080 --> 19:26.247
We don't really work here.

19:26.415 --> 19:29.125
You know, I thought
you hated being a PA.

19:31.295 --> 19:34.255
I don't know. It's not so bad.
I kind of feel like part of the team.

19:35.215 --> 19:37.758
It's good. Oh, taquito?
They're wonderful.

19:37.926 --> 19:41.888
No, um, listen, I conned my way
into the morgue.

19:42.055 --> 19:43.806
And?
- News reports are right.

19:43.974 --> 19:45.725
Brad's a doornail, no question.

19:45.893 --> 19:47.393
Copy that. Sorry, what?

19:47.561 --> 19:48.936
- Copy that?
- What'd you say?

19:49.104 --> 19:51.939
- News reports are right. Brad's a doornail.
- They're aware.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.108
- Who's aware?
- Sorry, what were you saying?

19:54.276 --> 19:59.071
Uh, what-- The newspaper's right.
Brad's a doornail, no question about it.

19:59.239 --> 20:00.990
It's a good thing we didn't skip town.

20:01.158 --> 20:03.576
Oh, come here.
I want you to hear something.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.953
Copy that. On my way.

20:07.831 --> 20:11.000
Hey, Dave, can you play him that thing
you were playing me earlier?

20:11.168 --> 20:12.543
Sure.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.253
Thanks.

20:17.257 --> 20:19.717
Doesn't matter, we're not leaving till we--

20:28.185 --> 20:30.937
E.V.P.
From the night of Brad's stage dive.

20:31.104 --> 20:34.232
All of a sudden, I'm getting electromagnetic
readings up the wazoo.

20:34.399 --> 20:37.610
- It's a legit haunting now.
- Who's the ghost, Dean? What's it want?

20:37.778 --> 20:40.655
I don't know. I think we should take a look
at Brad's death scene.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.929
Hey, where'd you get this DVD?
- They're called dailies.

21:05.097 --> 21:08.182
I got it from Cindy.
She's got this on-and-off thing with Drew.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.017
He dubbed me an extra copy.

21:13.397 --> 21:15.481
Here's where the guy
fell through the roof.

21:15.649 --> 21:16.983
Right.

21:18.860 --> 21:20.069
All right, here we go.

21:20.237 --> 21:22.446
They must have super hearing.

21:23.782 --> 21:25.157
Cut.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.326
Hey, wait. Go back. Go back.

21:29.037 --> 21:31.247
Right after-- Right after-- Yeah, right.

21:32.165 --> 21:33.499
Wait.

21:34.918 --> 21:36.377
There.

21:38.880 --> 21:41.048
It's like Three Men and a Baby
all over again.

21:43.051 --> 21:47.179
Selleck, Danson and Guttenberg.
And I don't know who played the baby.

21:47.347 --> 21:48.514
What's your point?

21:48.682 --> 21:52.018
There's a scene where people say
that the camera caught a ghost on film.

21:52.185 --> 21:53.561
In the background of one scene...

21:53.729 --> 21:57.189
...there was this boy that nobody
remembers from set. Spirit photography.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.570
I've seen her before.

22:08.869 --> 22:11.370
- Here, check this out.
Got your ears on? Over.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.915
- Yeah, go for Ozzy.
You have your eyes on Tara?

22:15.584 --> 22:18.044
No, I don't have a 20 on Tara.
I think she's 10-100.

22:18.211 --> 22:20.087
Copy that. Send her my way.

22:20.255 --> 22:21.255
Okay, copy that.

22:22.758 --> 22:24.550
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

22:26.928 --> 22:30.056
Elise Drummond. Starlet back in the '30s.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.436
Had an affair with a studio exec.

22:35.604 --> 22:38.314
He uses her up, fires her,
leaves her destitute.

22:38.482 --> 22:42.443
So Elise hangs herself from Stage 9's rafters
right into a scene they're shooting.

22:42.611 --> 22:43.611
Like our man Brad.

22:43.779 --> 22:46.614
- What, she's got it in for the studio brass?
- Possibly.

22:47.074 --> 22:50.451
I mean, it's a motive, and Brad's death
matches hers exactly.

22:50.619 --> 22:52.745
We're digging tonight, aren't we?

22:53.622 --> 22:58.667
That's a wrap, people.
Six a.m. call for crew tomorrow.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.796
Great work, everybody.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.673
McG, you're a genius.

23:04.841 --> 23:07.676
- You're kicking ass and taking names.
- Night, Jay.

23:09.221 --> 23:10.471
Yeah.

23:12.891 --> 23:14.308
Which way?

23:14.476 --> 23:17.561
Uh, over here.

23:23.151 --> 23:24.985
Hey.
- Yeah.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.740
Ha. This map is totally worth the 5 bucks.

23:29.908 --> 23:32.993
We gotta go check out Johnny Ramone's
grave when we're done here.

23:33.161 --> 23:34.829
You wanna dig him up too?

23:34.996 --> 23:36.914
Bite your tongue, heathen.

23:37.082 --> 23:38.207
That's cool.

23:38.375 --> 23:40.042
Dean, what I don't get is why now?

23:40.210 --> 23:44.338
After 75 years, Elise Drummond suddenly
goes homicidal, you know. Why this movie?

23:44.506 --> 23:47.174
Maybe she's mad
they're making a scary ghost flick.

23:47.342 --> 23:49.176
- Come on, is it really that scary?
- Here we go.

23:49.553 --> 23:50.970
Yeah.

23:52.055 --> 23:55.266
- All right.
Yahtzee.

24:05.527 --> 24:09.405
I know. No, I frigging hate McG's dailies.

24:09.573 --> 24:14.493
I can't control the guy. I'm telling you,
next one, I'm directing myself.

24:14.661 --> 24:15.995
What, you?

24:16.163 --> 24:18.038
No, Bob. You, I love.

24:18.206 --> 24:21.542
You're a genius, you're kicking ass
and taking names.

24:21.710 --> 24:26.005
Yeah, okay. Yeah, talk to you later, babe.
Uh-huh.

24:26.756 --> 24:27.756
What a dick.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.385
Oh, great.

24:34.014 --> 24:35.764
Hey, guys.

24:35.932 --> 24:38.559
Producer walking here. Hello?

25:36.910 --> 25:38.202
Hey.

25:39.955 --> 25:40.955
Hey, pal.

25:41.122 --> 25:45.417
Can you, uh, show me to the exit?
I can't see a damn thing here.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.589
Hey.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.635
Hey, putz, I'm talking to you.
Somebody could get hurt here.

25:56.972 --> 25:58.097
Aah!

25:58.473 --> 25:59.974
Ow!

26:02.811 --> 26:03.811
What the hell?

26:17.784 --> 26:20.119
Aah! Aah!

26:20.287 --> 26:21.287
No!

26:50.233 --> 26:51.609
They never forgive.

26:55.238 --> 26:57.698
Mitch? Ashley?

26:57.866 --> 27:00.117
And this summer,
they're coming back again...

27:00.285 --> 27:03.537
...to settle the score, again.

27:03.705 --> 27:05.414
You out here?

27:08.418 --> 27:11.045
Ashley and Todd, they're dead.
Wendy, they're dead.

27:11.212 --> 27:13.672
These bastards aren't taking us.
Not without a fight.

27:13.840 --> 27:15.883
I'm getting out of here now!
Brodie!

27:17.218 --> 27:20.429
From the producers
Of Cornfield Massacre, Monster Truck.

27:20.597 --> 27:23.891
And the director of Charlieâ€™s Angels,
Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle...

27:24.059 --> 27:27.436
...and Hell Hazers,
comes a new experience in terror.

27:29.230 --> 27:32.733
We must've brought them back.
Back from hell. Again.

27:33.902 --> 27:36.236
Hell Hazers II: The Reckoning.

27:36.404 --> 27:38.322
This film is not yet rated.

27:42.494 --> 27:44.411
Run-in with a giant fan.

27:44.579 --> 27:46.914
Same thing happened
to an electrician back in '66.

27:47.082 --> 27:49.583
- Guy named Billy Beard.
- What the hell, dude?

27:49.751 --> 27:52.711
I don't know. Doesn't seem like
Elise this time. It's not her m.o.

27:52.879 --> 27:55.130
We torched her.
Are we dealing with another ghost?

27:55.298 --> 27:57.925
- Maybe.
- Yeah, these things don't usually tag team.

28:01.721 --> 28:04.139
Everybody, gather around, okay?

28:04.307 --> 28:07.768
Got an announcement to make.
Hold that for me.

28:09.562 --> 28:10.604
Everyone...

28:11.106 --> 28:12.648
...huddle in.

28:15.318 --> 28:17.945
In light of Jay's accident last night...

28:18.113 --> 28:21.115
...and in cooperation
with the authorities...

28:21.282 --> 28:23.951
...we're shutting down production
for a few days.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.328
I know, I know.

28:26.955 --> 28:30.457
Look, I'm not gonna lie to you,
we've had a few setbacks this week.

28:31.292 --> 28:35.295
But we all know what Jay and Brad
wanted more than anything...

28:36.464 --> 28:39.133
...and that was to see
Hell Hazers II: The Reckoning...

28:39.300 --> 28:41.301
...on screens all across America.

28:42.178 --> 28:45.973
Now, we owe it to them
to go on and to pull together...

28:46.141 --> 28:49.143
...and make this damn movie, huh?

28:50.478 --> 28:53.605
But not-- Not today.

28:53.773 --> 28:55.983
Go home. Someone will call you.

28:56.526 --> 28:57.526
Okay, I'll take that.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.573
Wendy, don't.

29:02.741 --> 29:04.324
What, are you afraid of ghosts?

29:04.492 --> 29:06.034
Come on, it'll be fun.

29:08.538 --> 29:09.955
Sorry, can I go again?

29:10.123 --> 29:11.415
Hey.
Okay.

29:11.583 --> 29:13.333
Hey.

29:13.501 --> 29:16.503
So you find out
where the electrician's buried?

29:16.671 --> 29:19.006
He wasn't. Billy Beard was cremated.

29:20.008 --> 29:22.134
Great. Now what?

29:22.677 --> 29:23.927
No idea.

29:24.095 --> 29:26.597
Any more ghost cameos in the dailies?

29:26.765 --> 29:28.390
Not in the first six hours.

29:29.851 --> 29:31.727
You know, maybe the spirits are...

29:31.895 --> 29:34.855
...trying to shut down the movie
because they think it sucks.

29:35.023 --> 29:36.732
Because, I mean, it kind of does.

29:37.275 --> 29:39.026
McG
"Come on, it'll be fun."

29:39.194 --> 29:41.487
Come on, it'll be fun.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.461
Listen to the invocation.

29:59.214 --> 30:01.381
Dean, that's the real deal.

30:01.674 --> 30:03.717
A necromantic summoning ritual.

30:06.971 --> 30:09.556
What the hell is that doing
in a Hollywood movie?

30:09.724 --> 30:13.393
No, dude, we're down for a few days.
Force majeure. Yeah.

30:13.561 --> 30:16.396
It's cool, it gives me time to pitch
that time-travel thing.

30:16.564 --> 30:19.650
Yeah. All right, well, look,
get back to me on this, seriously.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.360
No, I'm serious.

30:21.528 --> 30:24.238
Dude, are you serious?
Because I'm serious.

30:24.405 --> 30:26.281
All right, cool.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.700
Guys, we're all shut down.
What are you still doing here?

30:28.868 --> 30:31.370
Yeah, um, just...

30:31.538 --> 30:34.748
Sorry, man. We-- We--
We couldn't help ourselves.

30:35.124 --> 30:37.376
We just had to tell you
that we read the script.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.752
And?

30:39.462 --> 30:41.088
Yeah.

30:41.714 --> 30:44.925
- It's, uh-- It's awesome.
- Awesome.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.594
Really awesome.
- I know, it's pretty rocking, right?

30:47.762 --> 30:50.430
- I'm glad you guys liked it.
- Yeah, I really liked, uh...

30:50.598 --> 30:52.099
...all the attention to detail.

30:52.267 --> 30:55.644
Dude, right on, that's my thing.
I mean, color me guilty, but that is me.

30:55.812 --> 30:57.437
I mean, I'm a total detail buff.

30:57.605 --> 31:01.024
No, I can tell. The way you worked in
all those Enochian summoning rituals...

31:01.192 --> 31:03.193
...in all the authentic language, and...

31:03.444 --> 31:04.778
What, you mean that Latin crap?

31:07.490 --> 31:08.991
No, man. That's Walter.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.618
Walter Dixon, the original writer.

31:11.786 --> 31:12.953
You like that garbage?

31:13.121 --> 31:14.496
Wait, Walter the PA, Walter?

31:14.664 --> 31:18.458
He's not a PA. He's got a clause in his
contract that allows him to come on set.

31:18.626 --> 31:19.960
But he wrote the invocations?

31:20.128 --> 31:22.462
He wrote a whack-job screenplay.
There's no pace...

31:22.630 --> 31:24.798
...no love interest,
it's all wackadoo exposition.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.342
I cut like 90 percent of it
to make it readable.

31:27.510 --> 31:29.011
Another 10 percent to make it good.

31:29.178 --> 31:30.178
Ha.

31:33.516 --> 31:37.311
Should've kept Walter's original script.
It's actually pretty good.

31:37.478 --> 31:38.979
Yeah.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.232
And it reads like a how-to manual
of conjuration.

31:42.400 --> 31:46.153
Like a textbook on how to summon ghosts
and get them to do whatever you want.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.947
- Yeah, like kill people.
- Yep.

31:49.991 --> 31:53.160
Let's say somewhere down the line
Walter learned some Black Magic.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.496
Yeah, and let's say he's pissed
at these people for wrecking his movie.

31:56.873 --> 31:58.206
Motive and means.

31:58.374 --> 31:59.833
It's worth checking out.

32:10.219 --> 32:12.429
So...

32:12.597 --> 32:14.514
...you wanted to meet?

32:16.434 --> 32:19.186
Hey, I'm a little busy here, buddy.
I'm working on a script.

32:19.354 --> 32:21.188
Oh, yeah, you guys worked on it a lot.

32:21.606 --> 32:24.399
It needed work. Why couldn't
we have done this in my office?

32:24.567 --> 32:28.570
You know the history, the lore
in my draft was completely accurate.

32:29.614 --> 32:31.865
We could've gotten it right
for the first time ever...

32:32.033 --> 32:33.659
...in this whorehouse of a town.

32:33.826 --> 32:36.036
But you tore it to shreds.

32:37.246 --> 32:41.208
You replaced it with cleavage
and fart jokes.

32:42.043 --> 32:43.043
It was real.

32:43.211 --> 32:45.587
Who gives a rat's ass about real?

32:45.755 --> 32:48.048
We're talking about ghosts here,
there's no such thing.

32:48.216 --> 32:50.384
That's where you're wrong, Martin.

33:02.063 --> 33:05.232
Okay, nut job. End of meeting.

33:16.244 --> 33:18.662
Oh, God, no. Please, no.

33:20.164 --> 33:23.750
You ruined it, Martin.
Everything I worked for.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.378
Oh, God! Walter!

33:26.546 --> 33:28.630
You're gonna find out
what being a ghost is like.

33:28.798 --> 33:30.590
Walter, please!

33:30.758 --> 33:32.259
Walter, help me!

33:43.187 --> 33:45.022
You are one hell of a PA.

33:45.773 --> 33:47.441
Yeah, I know.

33:48.985 --> 33:50.277
What are you doing?

33:50.445 --> 33:51.987
I could ask you the same thing.

33:52.196 --> 33:54.614
Raising these spirits from the dead...

33:54.782 --> 33:57.743
...making them murder for you,
that's playing with fire, Walter.

33:58.578 --> 34:00.704
You don't understand.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.290
You know what, you're right,
I don't understand.

34:04.959 --> 34:08.795
Wait, look, you put your heart
and soul into something.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.466
Years of hard work.
Years. And then they take it...

34:12.632 --> 34:15.302
...and they crap all over it!

34:15.636 --> 34:18.764
And then-- And then they want you
to smile and say thank you.

34:18.931 --> 34:20.724
Walter, listen,
it's just a movie. That's it.

34:24.978 --> 34:26.396
Look...

34:27.857 --> 34:30.150
...I got nothing against you, man.
You're not part of this.

34:30.318 --> 34:32.902
Just please, please, just leave.

34:33.071 --> 34:34.487
But Martin's gotta stay.

34:34.655 --> 34:36.239
Sorry, can't do that.

34:36.407 --> 34:40.159
It's not that we like him or anything,
it's just a matter of principle.

34:40.328 --> 34:42.661
Then I'm sorry too.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.748
Walter. Walter, pl-- Don't.

35:06.187 --> 35:07.771
Sam!

35:12.652 --> 35:13.902
Son of a--

35:17.198 --> 35:18.532
Come on, come on.

35:29.210 --> 35:31.503
Come on, come on, move.

35:45.685 --> 35:49.229
"Come to the coast,
we'll get together, have a few laughs."

35:54.068 --> 35:55.068
Oh, man.

35:56.988 --> 35:59.906
- I can't believe these ghosts are real.
What makes you say that?

36:10.585 --> 36:11.585
I don't understand.

36:11.752 --> 36:13.587
How is Walter controlling them?

36:13.754 --> 36:15.088
Probably with that talisman.

36:22.722 --> 36:23.722
What are you doing?

36:23.890 --> 36:26.683
I mean, if film cameras
pick these suckers up, then...

36:27.101 --> 36:29.144
...maybe, uh...

36:33.774 --> 36:35.317
Dean, right there!

36:37.570 --> 36:39.112
Got him.

36:40.990 --> 36:42.240
Hey, right there!

36:48.664 --> 36:50.207
- Here, you get the idea?
- Yeah.

36:50.374 --> 36:52.834
All right, you hold them off,
I'm going after Walter.

36:57.340 --> 37:00.759
- I cannot believe there's an afterlife.
- There's an afterlife, all right.

37:00.927 --> 37:03.470
But mostly it's a pain in the ass.

37:04.805 --> 37:05.805
There!

37:10.102 --> 37:11.311
It's over, Walter.

37:11.979 --> 37:13.396
Now, give it to me.

37:16.692 --> 37:19.778
There, okay, now no one can have it.

37:22.114 --> 37:24.324
- I wouldn't have done that if I were you.
- Oh, yeah?

37:24.492 --> 37:25.951
Yeah.
- And why not?

37:26.118 --> 37:27.410
Because you just freed them.

37:28.412 --> 37:30.664
We can't stop them now.

37:30.831 --> 37:32.457
Walter, you brought them back...

37:33.251 --> 37:34.793
...forced them to murder.

37:34.961 --> 37:37.003
They're not gonna be very happy
with you.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.464
Yeah, so why not?

38:04.407 --> 38:06.199
Oh, God.

38:06.450 --> 38:08.285
Oh, God.

38:09.829 --> 38:11.079
There!

38:12.456 --> 38:15.542
I don't understand, how can the spirits
appear in the camera phone?

38:15.710 --> 38:18.837
The video must pick up their frequencies
in a way that our eyes can't.

38:23.092 --> 38:24.551
Right there.

38:26.721 --> 38:30.140
Cut! Oh, print that one.
That's in the movie.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.726
Oh, loved it, kids. Loved it.

38:35.855 --> 38:39.691
You find out there's an afterlife,
and this is what you do with it?

38:40.151 --> 38:42.319
I needed a little jazz on the page.

39:01.964 --> 39:03.673
You're one hell of a PA.

39:05.301 --> 39:07.093
Thank you.

39:09.388 --> 39:10.847
Hi.

39:34.789 --> 39:36.456
God, I love this town.
