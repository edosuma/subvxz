WEBVTT

00:08.138 --> 00:09.487
Ah, the hospital in December.

00:09.531 --> 00:12.795
No one wants
to schedule procedures,

00:12.838 --> 00:14.666
people are leaving town
in droves,

00:14.710 --> 00:17.452
a hush settles over the OR.

00:18.453 --> 00:21.282
And we can par-tay!

00:21.325 --> 00:23.023
Oh, I can't wait
for Jenny to get here.

00:23.066 --> 00:24.720
I haven't told her
about the mixer yet.

00:24.763 --> 00:26.765
She is going to love it.FROST:
Ah!

00:26.809 --> 00:28.811
Kids are what make
the holidays so special.

00:28.854 --> 00:30.465
Yes.My children used to love it

00:30.508 --> 00:32.075
when I'd dress up for Christmas.

00:32.119 --> 00:33.685
As Jack Frost, of course.

00:33.729 --> 00:35.470
[chuckling]

00:35.513 --> 00:37.080
What's a... that?

00:37.124 --> 00:39.169
He's Old Man Winter.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.476
He nips at your nose?

00:41.519 --> 00:43.956
[clicks tongue]
Come on, girl.

00:44.000 --> 00:45.610
Don't get mad, I grew up in L.A.

00:45.654 --> 00:48.570
It's 80 degrees at Christmas
and everything's on fire.

00:48.613 --> 00:49.614
[elevator bell dings]

00:50.528 --> 00:52.487
Ah! There you are!

00:52.530 --> 00:54.924
[giggles]
Merry Christmas!

00:54.967 --> 00:56.534
It's December 19th.I know,

00:56.578 --> 00:58.971
but we're not gonna be together
on the actual holiday.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.234
Oh, that's gonna be weird.

01:00.277 --> 01:01.757
Mm-hmm.I'm gonna miss you.

01:01.800 --> 01:04.629
Yes. Me, too.
Which is why... [gasps]

01:04.673 --> 01:07.589
We're not gonna be able to have
our whole Christmas,

01:07.632 --> 01:10.287
but we'll have the abridged
version in the lounge tonight.

01:10.331 --> 01:14.944
Carols and eggnog,
joyful colleagues and Caleb.

01:16.554 --> 01:17.903
Ooh! That sounds fun.

01:17.947 --> 01:20.254
But can we do it after
I get back from my cruise?

01:20.297 --> 01:23.257
We can't do Christmas
after Christmas.

01:23.300 --> 01:25.520
But we can do Christmas
before Christmas?

01:25.563 --> 01:27.522
Yes, everybody knows that.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.133
Dr. Kenney, I have
a patient for you:

01:30.177 --> 01:32.483
an 18-year-old admitted
with alcohol poisoning.

01:32.527 --> 01:35.617
Well, I have a 27-year-old
admitted with Christmas spirit.

01:35.660 --> 01:37.227
[chuckles softly]

01:37.271 --> 01:39.490
Tell me, is this gonna
be my whole month?

01:39.534 --> 01:40.535
Oh, yeah.
Okay.

01:40.578 --> 01:42.624
Okay.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.669
You stay put, I'll get
back as fast as I can,

01:44.713 --> 01:46.062
we'll go to my mixer,

01:46.106 --> 01:48.238
and we'll put your tinfoil blob
on top of the tree.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.153
Okay, um, but I can't
stay too late.

01:50.197 --> 01:51.633
I-I didn't know you
were gonna do this.

01:51.676 --> 01:53.025
I still have to pack.

01:53.069 --> 01:54.723
The only thing you have to pack
for that cruise are

01:54.766 --> 01:56.507
several different
facial expressions

01:56.551 --> 01:59.119
for every time your father says,
"All the food is free."

01:59.162 --> 02:03.166
Are you sure you're okay with me
going on this cruise with Dad?

02:03.210 --> 02:04.776
Yes, I'm fine.
I just want to spend

02:04.820 --> 02:06.517
a little holiday time with you.

02:06.561 --> 02:08.084
Dr. Kenney!Yeah. Okay.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.348
Oh.

02:11.392 --> 02:13.655
So, is that what you're
wearing on our date?

02:13.698 --> 02:16.832
No, I planned on changing
into my formal scrubs.[chuckles]

02:16.875 --> 02:18.573
Oh, you, uh, brought a suitcase.

02:18.616 --> 02:20.792
This is moving
a little fast for me.

02:20.836 --> 02:23.578
[phone ringing]Oh, I have to get this.

02:23.621 --> 02:25.623
Hey, Dad.
[chuckles softly]

02:25.667 --> 02:29.105
Yes, I'm excited
about the magic show.

02:29.149 --> 02:30.411
Oh, shows?

02:31.238 --> 02:32.630
Great.

02:32.674 --> 02:35.677
Lot of pressure for this
date with Jenny tonight.

02:35.720 --> 02:37.809
You've only got one chance to
make a good enough impression

02:37.853 --> 02:40.595
to last her through
her many days at sea.

02:40.638 --> 02:42.205
I think I can handle it.

02:42.249 --> 02:44.512
I don't know, there's gonna
be a lot of Europeans stuffed

02:44.555 --> 02:46.905
into a lot of Speedos
on that boat.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.213
But if you can handle it...

02:50.257 --> 02:51.345
Oh, fine.

02:51.388 --> 02:52.737
You think I haven't
thought about that?

02:52.781 --> 02:55.436
All I've thought about for weeks
is hot dudes in Speedos.

02:56.741 --> 02:58.526
I heard it.

02:58.569 --> 03:00.919
That's why I need to make this
date happen before she leaves.

03:00.963 --> 03:02.704
If she goes on this cruise
before we go out,

03:02.747 --> 03:04.227
I'm done. No shot.

03:04.271 --> 03:06.316
All right. I was just...

03:06.360 --> 03:07.709
trying to mess with your head,

03:07.752 --> 03:09.667
but clearly
you don't need my help.

03:10.886 --> 03:11.843
FROST:
All right, everyone.

03:11.887 --> 03:12.931
Listen up.

03:12.975 --> 03:14.890
In the spirit
of the season,

03:14.933 --> 03:17.022
an entire accounting department
has been admitted

03:17.066 --> 03:19.982
after a food poisoning incident
at an office holiday party.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.984
The ER is sending up
their overflow,

03:22.027 --> 03:25.248
so we need all residents to stay
on shift for as long as it takes

03:25.292 --> 03:26.815
to stabilize and
treat everyone.

03:26.858 --> 03:27.816
We need all hands on deck.

03:27.859 --> 03:28.904
No, no, no, no.

03:28.947 --> 03:30.427
Ah, it's gonna be okay,
Dr. Kutcher.

03:30.471 --> 03:31.472
We're doctors.

03:32.908 --> 03:34.823
[chuckling]

03:34.866 --> 03:36.912
I bet "all hands on deck"
is gonna be

03:36.955 --> 03:38.740
the theme
for Jenny's cruise.

03:40.611 --> 03:43.745
♪

03:43.788 --> 03:44.833
[beep]

03:50.055 --> 03:52.057
Okay, Harper, we're treating
your dehydration

03:52.101 --> 03:54.059
from the alcohol with IV fluids,

03:54.103 --> 03:55.147
and we're giving you
some analgesics

03:55.191 --> 03:56.192
for your abdominal pain.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.367
You'll feel better soon.

03:57.411 --> 03:59.108
Oh, thank you.

03:59.151 --> 04:01.066
I could've told you she
had alcohol poisoning

04:01.110 --> 04:02.285
when I found her throwing up
on the carpet

04:02.329 --> 04:04.287
in Izzy Phillipson's rec room.

04:05.375 --> 04:08.291
Sorry, Mom.
I bet you are.

04:08.335 --> 04:10.293
She comes home from college
for the winter break,

04:10.337 --> 04:13.078
supposedly to spend time
with her family.

04:13.122 --> 04:15.298
And then I barely see her
until I get a frantic call

04:15.342 --> 04:18.475
from her friend at some party
and find her drunk on the floor

04:18.519 --> 04:20.260
like Liza Minnelli.

04:23.001 --> 04:24.655
Who?

04:24.699 --> 04:28.180
You're in enough trouble.
Don't question my references.

04:28.224 --> 04:30.531
See how she is?It's like they hit
a certain age,

04:30.574 --> 04:32.097
and everything else
becomes so important,

04:32.141 --> 04:33.969
they have no time for Mom.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.101
How old is yours?
27.

04:36.145 --> 04:39.017
It's a tough age.

04:39.061 --> 04:40.932
Name one that isn't.
Once they grow up,

04:40.976 --> 04:43.283
all of a sudden
you're not a priority anymore.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.197
Oh, tell me about it.
Before you know it,

04:45.241 --> 04:47.156
you're eating an entire
gingerbread house

04:47.199 --> 04:48.462
on Christmas Eve
all by yourself,

04:48.505 --> 04:50.072
and they're living
it up with their dad

04:50.115 --> 04:52.683
at a holiday buffet
on the open sea.

04:52.727 --> 04:54.903
What?

04:54.946 --> 04:56.426
It's an old saying.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.735
You know, this food poisoning
is the perfect metaphor

05:00.778 --> 05:04.173
for the toxic excesses
of the holidays.

05:04.216 --> 05:05.522
I would say it's
the perfect metaphor

05:05.566 --> 05:06.958
for the perils of the potluck.

05:07.002 --> 05:09.396
Because there's always
an uninvited guest.

05:10.222 --> 05:12.268
Bacteria.

05:12.312 --> 05:14.792
I would've expected this kind
of sloppy food preparation

05:14.836 --> 05:16.925
from the sales department,
but accounting?

05:16.968 --> 05:18.013
Be better.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.320
Can we focus?!

05:20.363 --> 05:22.452
We all took an oath
to treat people

05:22.496 --> 05:23.975
as quickly as
possible, so...

05:24.019 --> 05:26.195
We'll start by testing for
serious foodborne illness

05:26.238 --> 05:28.197
such as listeria and E. coli.

05:28.240 --> 05:31.156
If it's serious enough, we'll
have to report it to the CDC.

05:31.200 --> 05:32.941
These stool samples
we've collected will go to

05:32.984 --> 05:35.291
the lab for testing so we can
identify the illness.

05:35.335 --> 05:37.206
And off you go.

05:39.251 --> 05:41.123
Come on, seriously?

05:41.166 --> 05:43.647
Well, you got two hours
till dinner.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.432
Can't take Nurse Flash
more than four

05:45.475 --> 05:47.347
to shuffle those to the lab.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.436
Screw this.

05:51.394 --> 05:52.439
Sorry.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.270
You're killing it, Doris!

06:01.926 --> 06:03.014
Move, move, move, move, move!

06:03.058 --> 06:04.276
Hey.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.235
Hey. What you got there?

06:06.278 --> 06:08.542
Oh, you know,
just super-awesome doctor stuff.

06:08.585 --> 06:10.805
Mm. You know, if you're
too busy with work,

06:10.848 --> 06:13.547
we can wait and go out after
I get back from my cruise.

06:13.590 --> 06:14.983
Unless, you know...

06:15.026 --> 06:17.202
pirates.
[chuckles]

06:17.246 --> 06:19.030
It's-it's fine. I'll just have
to meet you at the restaurant.

06:19.074 --> 06:21.206
Okay. I just need some time
to run home and get ready.

06:22.469 --> 06:24.427
And I know that's poo.

06:27.125 --> 06:29.127
Okay, Jenny, I'm back.

06:29.171 --> 06:30.999
Let's go to the lounge!

06:31.042 --> 06:33.262
It is a winter
wonderland in there.

06:33.305 --> 06:34.350
Well, I'm exaggerating.

06:34.394 --> 06:35.786
It's more like a winter...

06:35.830 --> 06:37.788
"Hey, this is better
than normal" land.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.747
Wait, wait, wait, wait,

06:39.790 --> 06:41.836
you're not leaving
already, are you?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.142
Yeah, I told you, remember?
I have to go.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.188
Come on,
I worked really hard to make it

06:46.231 --> 06:48.625
so that we would have
some holiday time together.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.148
Mom, you've known about
this cruise for weeks.

06:50.192 --> 06:52.194
I don't know why you're
making such a thing of this.

06:52.237 --> 06:53.978
Because everything's
just moving so fast,

06:54.022 --> 06:55.458
and it snuck up on me.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
And I've seen
the bikinis you wear.

06:57.025 --> 06:58.287
It's not gonna take
that much time

06:58.330 --> 07:01.029
to pack a piece of string,
Jennifer.

07:01.072 --> 07:03.161
Fine! Okay, the truth is...

07:03.205 --> 07:06.208
I'm not leaving to get
ready for the trip.

07:06.251 --> 07:07.818
I have a date.

07:07.862 --> 07:10.473
Oh, so you're seeing somebody?

07:10.517 --> 07:12.649
Well, no. Tonight is
just a first date.

07:12.693 --> 07:16.305
So, first you ditch me
for your dad, and now

07:16.348 --> 07:19.526
you're deserting me for
some random guy on Christmas?

07:19.569 --> 07:21.136
I am not deserting you.

07:21.179 --> 07:22.572
And it's not even Christmas.

07:22.616 --> 07:24.269
It's Christmas Eve Eve

07:24.313 --> 07:26.489
Eve Eve Eve Eve.

07:26.533 --> 07:28.099
I'm sorry.

07:28.143 --> 07:32.147
Is it so wrong
to expect 30 to 45

07:32.190 --> 07:34.323
to 50 minutes with your mother?

07:34.366 --> 07:36.325
Oh, wow, okay?

07:36.368 --> 07:40.285
I'm going on a cruise with Dad
and a guilt trip with you!

07:41.983 --> 07:44.899
Well, that kind of attitude
is not even welcome at my party.

07:44.942 --> 07:47.771
Mom, you can't just spring
things on me like this.

07:47.815 --> 07:49.469
I have a life, too.

07:50.557 --> 07:52.994
♪ Joy to the world

07:53.037 --> 07:55.083
♪ The Lord is come... No!

08:03.613 --> 08:05.963
So apparently now I'm
the bad guy for wanting

08:06.007 --> 08:08.836
to spend a little time with
my daughter before the holidays.

08:08.879 --> 08:10.577
She's the Grinch.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.275
Dennis, are the results
of my stool samples in yet?Do you mind?

08:13.318 --> 08:15.146
We're dealing with
a Christmas crisis.

08:15.190 --> 08:17.018
Jenny's deserting
Carol tonight

08:17.061 --> 08:19.629
to go on some stupid date.

08:19.673 --> 08:20.630
LEXIE:
Oh, wow.

08:20.674 --> 08:23.198
That's so surprising.
With whom?

08:23.241 --> 08:24.416
No idea.

08:24.460 --> 08:26.506
But I'm sure it's some
loser-- Jenny has

08:26.549 --> 08:28.986
the absolute worst taste in men.

08:29.030 --> 08:31.119
I don't know, maybe he's,
like, super charming?

08:31.162 --> 08:34.470
Nah. I bet
he's a total tool.

08:34.514 --> 08:35.471
Definitely.

08:35.515 --> 08:39.083
With, like,
dumb poofy hair.

08:39.127 --> 08:41.042
And overly white teeth.Yeah.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.697
That is so her type.

08:43.740 --> 08:46.700
You know... if Jenny's
not coming, there's no point.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.528
I'm-I'm canceling the mixer.

08:48.571 --> 08:52.009
Wow. I guess we have different
definitions of "cohost."

08:52.053 --> 08:54.142
You can't just cancel Christmas.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.360
It's not Christmas.

08:55.404 --> 08:57.711
It's Christmas Eve
Eve Eve Eve Eve Eve.

08:59.016 --> 09:00.540
CALEB:
See?

09:00.583 --> 09:02.672
Christmas tears
families apart.
No.

09:02.716 --> 09:06.154
That's because they've forgotten
what's important: the presents.

09:06.197 --> 09:08.243
Totally unnecessary presents.

09:08.286 --> 09:10.637
You got headphones last year?
Here's some AirPods.

09:10.680 --> 09:13.161
You already have AirPods?
Here's a drone.

09:13.204 --> 09:15.076
Christmas!

09:16.120 --> 09:17.644
Daniel,
your test results came in.

09:17.687 --> 09:20.472
Okay. We've got a positive match
for listeria.

09:20.516 --> 09:22.474
Oh, intense but treatable.Well, the patients

09:22.518 --> 09:24.520
will just need supportive care
till they improve.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.609
This is great news-- just
pump 'em up with some fluids,

09:26.653 --> 09:28.306
and I'll be off to dinner.MAYA:
Listen up.

09:28.350 --> 09:29.699
No one's going home.

09:29.743 --> 09:32.093
We have more food poisoning
victims on the way.

09:32.136 --> 09:34.182
Aw, come on!

09:34.225 --> 09:36.227
Apparently
the I.T. department

09:36.271 --> 09:38.447
got into accounting's
leftovers.

09:38.490 --> 09:40.188
You got to be kidding me.I know.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.929
Who eats leftovers
from a potluck?

09:41.972 --> 09:43.974
♪

09:47.325 --> 09:50.067
[grunts]
Oh. So this is
uncomfortable?

09:50.111 --> 09:51.460
Yeah.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.070
Harper's pain should
be subsiding by now.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.029
This may not be
alcohol poisoning.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.683
I'm gonna order
an ultrasound.

09:56.726 --> 09:58.467
Oh, my God, you're pregnant?

09:59.511 --> 10:01.905
Probably... not.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.255
Probably?

10:04.299 --> 10:06.823
It's-it's not that
kind of ultrasound.

10:06.867 --> 10:08.869
You couldn't have led with that?

10:11.132 --> 10:13.569
We'll get to the bottom
of this soon, I promise.

10:15.136 --> 10:16.659
Now that we know we're
dealing with listeria,

10:16.703 --> 10:19.053
we need to find the
source of the illness

10:19.096 --> 10:21.055
for our report
to the CDC.

10:21.098 --> 10:23.100
If it came from someone's
kitchen, it could be contained,

10:23.144 --> 10:25.233
but if it came from a restaurant
or a grocery store,

10:25.276 --> 10:27.452
we may have a large-scale
outbreak on our hands.

10:27.496 --> 10:28.758
FROST:
So we have a
mystery to solve.

10:28.802 --> 10:31.848
What was the tainted
dish at the potluck?

10:31.892 --> 10:34.459
Each of you take a patient
and find out what they ate.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.245
Whatever dish they all had in
common is the contaminated one.

10:39.377 --> 10:40.509
I've got this patient over here.

10:40.552 --> 10:42.990
Hi, Tom. I've got
a few questions for you.

10:43.033 --> 10:45.732
Great. I'm feeling
pretty chatty.

10:45.775 --> 10:48.169
Hey there, Sherry,
how you feeling?

10:48.212 --> 10:50.171
Like someone
who's been getting sick

10:50.214 --> 10:53.914
out of both ends
nonstop for hours.

10:54.915 --> 10:56.612
That's fair.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.093
And could you tell us what
you ate at your holiday party?

10:59.136 --> 11:01.182
Do I have to?

11:01.225 --> 11:03.924
It would
really help us.

11:03.967 --> 11:06.753
[inhales]
It was artichoke dip,

11:06.796 --> 11:10.104
deep dish pizza...

11:11.279 --> 11:14.151
...ham roll-ups.

11:14.195 --> 11:16.371
Oh, my God.

11:16.414 --> 11:18.286
Ambrosia salad,

11:18.329 --> 11:20.418
seafood paella,

11:20.462 --> 11:22.986
and broccoli casserole.

11:23.030 --> 11:24.858
Thanks, Sherry,
you're a trooper.

11:24.901 --> 11:26.990
And, uh, one last thing.
We'll need a sample.

11:27.034 --> 11:28.470
Yeah, that shouldn't be
a problem.

11:30.428 --> 11:32.822
Kutcher, any leads?

11:32.866 --> 11:34.258
Tom only ate
the artichoke dip,

11:34.302 --> 11:36.217
ham roll-ups, and
ambrosia salad.

11:36.260 --> 11:38.741
My patient didn't have the ham
or the ambrosia,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.221
just the artichoke dip.

11:40.264 --> 11:42.005
Oh, ours ate
the artichoke dip, too.

11:42.049 --> 11:44.225
Boom! It's got to be
the artichoke dip.

11:44.268 --> 11:45.443
Mystery solved.

11:45.487 --> 11:46.793
Let's all get on
with our night.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.621
Whoa. We got another one
from the I.T. department.

11:49.665 --> 11:51.885
Now, he wasn't actually
invited to the party,

11:51.928 --> 11:55.236
but he reads all their e-mails,
so he just showed up anyway.

11:55.279 --> 11:57.238
Hello, good sir.

11:57.281 --> 11:59.283
We have an important
question for you.

11:59.327 --> 12:01.242
Did you eat the
artichoke dip?

12:01.285 --> 12:03.200
No. There was none left.

12:03.244 --> 12:07.465
So we still haven't found the
source of the tainted dish.

12:07.509 --> 12:09.424
It's gonna be
a long night.

12:12.775 --> 12:15.386
Hey, so...

12:15.430 --> 12:17.606
the results of Harper's
ultrasound revealed

12:17.649 --> 12:20.565
that her symptoms were not only
from alcohol poisoning.

12:20.609 --> 12:22.785
She had a ruptured ovarian cyst,

12:22.829 --> 12:24.918
which explains the pain
and the vomiting.

12:24.961 --> 12:26.136
Oh, my God, is
that serious?

12:26.180 --> 12:27.398
She'll be perfectly fine.

12:27.442 --> 12:28.399
She doesn't even need
further treatment,

12:28.443 --> 12:29.400
just some rest.

12:29.444 --> 12:32.273
So here I've been yelling at you

12:32.316 --> 12:33.970
while you were suffering?[sighs]

12:34.014 --> 12:35.363
I'm so sorry.

12:35.406 --> 12:37.191
I have been
a terrible mom.

12:37.234 --> 12:39.410
No, it's okay, Mom,
you didn't know.

12:39.454 --> 12:41.238
And you're not a terrible mom.

12:41.282 --> 12:44.546
You just wanted a special
Christmas with your daughter.

12:44.589 --> 12:45.677
I guess I was excited
that we'd finally

12:45.721 --> 12:47.157
get to hang out together.

12:47.201 --> 12:49.072
I was a little hurt when
you went to that party.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.988
Of course, because
she abandoned you.

12:52.032 --> 12:53.337
It was selfish of me.

12:53.381 --> 12:55.426
Oh, selfish is
a little harsh.

12:55.470 --> 12:57.385
You're a grown woman now.

12:57.428 --> 12:59.561
I can't expect you to spend
all your time with your mom.

12:59.604 --> 13:01.432
I do like hanging out
with you, Mom.

13:01.476 --> 13:05.306
Oh, you do?
That is so sweet.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.568
I love you, Mom.

13:06.611 --> 13:08.048
I love you, honey.

13:08.091 --> 13:10.180
Oh.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.449
The remaining
suspect dishes

13:18.493 --> 13:20.277
are the store-bought
broccoli casserole,

13:20.321 --> 13:22.062
the deep dish pizza
from Gino's restaurant,

13:22.105 --> 13:24.368
and the homemade
seafood paella.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.761
But Tom didn't eat
the seafood paella.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.067
Mike didn't eat the pizza.

13:27.110 --> 13:28.895
And Amanda didn't eat
the broccoli casserole.

13:28.938 --> 13:30.984
Let's start from the top
with all the dishes.

13:31.027 --> 13:32.115
Who brought what?

13:32.159 --> 13:33.203
Sherry brought the pizza.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.683
Annie brought
the broccoli casserole.

13:34.726 --> 13:36.511
Tom brought
the seafood paella.FROST: Wait.

13:36.554 --> 13:38.513
Tom brought the paella

13:38.556 --> 13:40.341
but says he didn't eat it,

13:40.384 --> 13:42.865
which is why we ruled it out.

13:42.909 --> 13:46.390
Why does one not try
one's own dish? Hmm?

13:46.434 --> 13:48.349
Curious.

13:48.392 --> 13:50.351
That is curious.

13:53.571 --> 13:55.399
Tom.

13:55.443 --> 13:57.706
I'm wondering why
you didn't try your dish.

13:57.749 --> 14:01.362
I don't know.
I didn't get a chance.

14:01.405 --> 14:03.320
Didn't get a chance?

14:03.364 --> 14:06.323
A seafood paella is a very
involved dish to prepare.

14:06.367 --> 14:08.369
All of the shellfish
must be perfectly timed.

14:08.412 --> 14:10.371
The hint of saffron
ever so delicately balanced.

14:10.414 --> 14:12.199
Seems like exactly
the kind of dish

14:12.242 --> 14:14.897
one would want to at least
taste after so much work.

14:14.941 --> 14:16.986
Mm, you wanted to impress
your colleagues so badly,

14:17.030 --> 14:18.422
didn't you, Tom?

14:18.466 --> 14:19.815
Wanted to be king
of the potluck,

14:19.859 --> 14:21.512
but then it all
went wrong.

14:22.557 --> 14:23.384
Didn't it, Tom?

14:23.427 --> 14:25.516
All right!

14:25.560 --> 14:27.475
I ate the paella.

14:27.518 --> 14:30.043
And it's ripping
my insides apart.

14:30.086 --> 14:31.609
Why'd you lie, Tom?

14:31.653 --> 14:33.002
Why'd you say
you didn't eat it?

14:33.046 --> 14:35.483
I didn't want everyone
to know it was my fault.

14:35.526 --> 14:37.093
People still haven't forgiven me

14:37.137 --> 14:40.053
for the clam dip
from the Fourth of July.

14:40.096 --> 14:44.318
Stop making seafood.

14:44.361 --> 14:45.667
I was late for the party

14:45.710 --> 14:47.408
so I took it off the stove
a little early.

14:47.451 --> 14:49.627
How early?Two hours?

14:50.759 --> 14:53.718
What the hell, Tom?

14:53.762 --> 14:56.069
And since the tainted dish
came from Tom's kitchen,

14:56.112 --> 14:57.853
any chance of an outbreak
is contained.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.246
Excellent work, doctors.

14:59.289 --> 15:01.465
Mm, ah, too late
for you, boo-boo.

15:01.509 --> 15:02.640
Missed your reservation.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.685
Sorry, babe.

15:03.728 --> 15:04.904
No, my night's
not ruined yet.

15:04.947 --> 15:06.253
Jenny's meeting me
back here.

15:06.296 --> 15:07.776
I just got to come up
with something good.

15:11.475 --> 15:13.042
Hey, there you are.Hey, hi.

15:13.086 --> 15:14.957
Thanks for meeting me back here.
It's been crazy.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.611
They had to move Tom
into a secure ward

15:16.654 --> 15:17.829
because everyone
was trying to kill him.

15:19.831 --> 15:21.529
You look really great.
Oh.

15:21.572 --> 15:23.139
I'm excited
we're finally doing this.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.141
Yeah, me, too.

15:25.185 --> 15:27.578
Everything okay?

15:27.622 --> 15:29.580
Yeah. Yeah. I just
got into a fight

15:29.624 --> 15:31.495
earlier with my mom, and
it's just bothering me.

15:31.539 --> 15:33.497
But it'll be okay,
let's go out.

15:33.541 --> 15:35.586
I don't want to keep
putting this off,

15:35.630 --> 15:38.024
and I'm really
looking forward to it.

15:38.067 --> 15:40.156
Yeah, you seem pumped.

15:40.200 --> 15:42.854
[sighs] I'm sorry,
it's just...

15:42.898 --> 15:44.465
I mean, Christmas was
already gonna be weird

15:44.508 --> 15:47.729
and now... now
it feels worse.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.995
You know what?
Uh, we missed our reservation,

15:53.039 --> 15:55.084
and I didn't have time
to plan anything better.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.607
And I want this
to be special.

15:56.651 --> 15:59.001
Maybe we should
just postpone?

15:59.045 --> 16:01.177
Are you sure?Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

16:01.221 --> 16:02.787
We'll go out after you get back
from your cruise.

16:02.831 --> 16:04.964
I can't wait.

16:10.186 --> 16:12.188
[sighs]

16:18.412 --> 16:20.109
[sighs]

16:28.857 --> 16:30.293
Hey, Jenny, it's Mom.

16:30.337 --> 16:32.382
Just wanted to talk
about what happened earlier.

16:32.426 --> 16:33.818
Oh, never mind.
You're here.

16:33.862 --> 16:35.037
Looking right at you.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.386
Ooh, you look nice.
I'm waving.

16:36.430 --> 16:38.388
Okay, love you. Bye.
It's Mom.

16:40.129 --> 16:41.087
Hi.

16:41.130 --> 16:42.653
Hi.

16:42.697 --> 16:44.438
So, you all dressed
for your date?

16:44.481 --> 16:47.615
Yeah, but I canceled it.

16:47.658 --> 16:49.269
What? Why?

16:49.312 --> 16:50.531
Can you return the dress?

16:50.574 --> 16:51.488
Did you leave the tags on it?

16:51.532 --> 16:54.100
Of course I did.

16:54.143 --> 16:56.058
[sighs]
I couldn't leave

16:56.102 --> 16:58.234
for my trip
without talking to you.

16:58.278 --> 16:59.453
I don't like
how we left things.

16:59.496 --> 17:00.671
Neither do I.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.109
I'm sorry.
Me, too.

17:03.152 --> 17:05.459
Oh.

17:05.502 --> 17:06.677
I was actually
still pretty mad

17:06.721 --> 17:08.462
until I stopped
at a Rite Aid

17:08.505 --> 17:10.246
and saw one of those obnoxious
singing, dancing Santas,

17:10.290 --> 17:11.552
and it made me miss you.

17:11.595 --> 17:13.989
Oh, sweetie.

17:14.033 --> 17:17.427
Honey, I think I was
being a little selfish.

17:17.471 --> 17:19.081
I know you have a life.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.648
I think I'm actually
slightly jealous

17:20.691 --> 17:22.519
that you're spending
Christmas with your father.

17:22.563 --> 17:24.695
Oh, were you trying
to hide that?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.568
Because you were doing
a really bad job.

17:28.917 --> 17:30.397
Well, we're only
with Dad this year

17:30.440 --> 17:31.659
because you're so busy.

17:31.702 --> 17:33.443
I know, and I feel
bad about that.

17:33.487 --> 17:35.967
It's Christmas and
I'm not with my kids.

17:36.011 --> 17:37.621
I mean, I knew our traditions
would change,

17:37.665 --> 17:39.406
but I didn't think it would be
because of me.

17:39.449 --> 17:42.452
And I, I feel guilty about that
so I made you feel guilty.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.672
Yeah, but you don't
have to feel guilty.

17:44.715 --> 17:46.891
You're busy doing
the most inspiring,

17:46.935 --> 17:49.155
awesome thing
any mom has ever done.

17:49.198 --> 17:50.460
And it's just this year.

17:50.504 --> 17:52.201
Yeah, but what if it's
not just this year?

17:52.245 --> 17:53.898
What if my schedule
doesn't get better?

17:53.942 --> 17:56.423
And what if you meet someone on
that cruise and you marry them

17:56.466 --> 17:58.164
and you spend next Christmas
with their family,

17:58.207 --> 17:59.817
and they're those fancy kind
of people who invite me

17:59.861 --> 18:01.167

I don't know.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.633
I hear this book has gotten

I'm always looking for
something new to read.

19:23.466 --> 19:26.208
You see how the holidays
bring families together?

Yeah. They usually
bring my family together

19:28.384 --> 19:30.821
for foie gras and
disappointed silences.

to spend this one

Really?
Mm-hmm.
