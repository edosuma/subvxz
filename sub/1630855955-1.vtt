WEBVTT

00:07.137 --> 00:09.096
You have been attacking me
since day one.

00:09.096 --> 00:10.575
Excuse me?

00:10.575 --> 00:13.100
You stepped on board
with the worst attitude.

00:13.100 --> 00:14.101
I have to leave you at the dock.

00:14.101 --> 00:16.103
Otherwise, we'’re detained.

00:16.103 --> 00:17.800
This is a sh---show.

00:17.800 --> 00:18.975
You need to be on top of this.

00:18.975 --> 00:20.194
What do you mean
I'’m not on top?

00:20.194 --> 00:22.065
Well, you'’re obviously not,
are you?

00:22.065 --> 00:24.807
Oh my God.
Everyone is just----ing wild.

00:24.807 --> 00:26.287
You'’ve been a fake-ass bitch.

00:26.287 --> 00:27.288
talking sh--
behind my back since day one.

00:27.288 --> 00:31.205
I am not speaking to you. Bye.

00:31.205 --> 00:34.077
This is my first time
as a chief stew.

00:34.077 --> 00:38.647
I have never come across
a crew this crazy.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.913
And I don'’t think I ever will.

00:43.913 --> 00:45.654
Welcome aboard.

00:45.654 --> 00:49.092
Let'’s----ing go!

00:49.092 --> 00:52.008
Oh, my God.
What a dream.

00:52.008 --> 00:54.402
Whoo!

00:58.406 --> 00:59.581
Fire!

00:59.581 --> 01:00.930
Oh, God.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.323
ing hell.

01:02.323 --> 01:05.326
Oh, this is gorgeous.

01:05.326 --> 01:09.025
This San Francisco is way nicer
than the San Francisco we know.

01:09.025 --> 01:10.983
They would like a
big gay breakfast.

01:10.983 --> 01:12.942
Oh, my.
Where does this go?

01:12.942 --> 01:14.030
Matthew will show you.

01:16.641 --> 01:17.947
There'’s a couple.

01:17.947 --> 01:19.731
Thirst----ing trap.

01:21.994 --> 01:23.387
Yeah.

01:23.387 --> 01:25.824
My goal is to not get
too distracted by these ladies.

01:25.824 --> 01:27.130
ing hell.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.524
I love a girly girl with nails.

01:29.524 --> 01:32.135
And a handbag, and, this,
you know...

01:33.441 --> 01:35.486
- You don'’t think so?
- No.

01:35.486 --> 01:37.097
Fine, we'’re [bleep] buddies.

01:38.620 --> 01:40.143
The organization'’s a sh---show.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.623
Excuse me?
Don'’t do this with me.

01:41.623 --> 01:43.320
Every situation that'’s happened,

01:43.320 --> 01:45.148
guess who'’s the
common denominator?

01:45.148 --> 01:47.063
Try to show authority
from day one.

01:47.063 --> 01:48.282
I am the chief stew.

01:48.282 --> 01:49.805
I will put you on
the dock so fast,

01:49.805 --> 01:51.198
if you don'’t change.

01:51.198 --> 01:54.505
You will never control me.

01:54.505 --> 01:57.204
Your screaming,
you lack of respect.

01:57.204 --> 01:59.162
I don'’t want a person
like you on board.

02:02.122 --> 02:04.036
Oh, my God!

02:04.036 --> 02:05.777
Kyle, you are a horrible human.

02:05.777 --> 02:08.258
Fit in the shoe box, honey.
So are you.

02:22.229 --> 02:26.581
Wow. Such a beautiful
day to go boating.

02:26.581 --> 02:28.409
Genoa'’s one of the
busiest ports in Europe.

02:28.409 --> 02:30.193
I actually lived
in Genoa for a year.

02:30.193 --> 02:31.412
It'’s beautiful.

02:31.412 --> 02:33.457
It is the Italian Riviera.

02:33.457 --> 02:36.504
You have all these amazing
places you can drop anchor.

02:36.504 --> 02:38.201
It'’s an epic experience,

02:38.201 --> 02:40.116
but this season
hasn'’t even started

02:40.116 --> 02:42.162
and it'’s already a sh-- show.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.643
Baby'’s got back.

02:49.865 --> 02:52.433
Ugh!

02:52.433 --> 02:54.174
Hello.

02:54.174 --> 02:55.610
Who is that?

02:55.610 --> 02:57.177
Ah!

02:57.177 --> 02:58.439
Welcome back.

02:58.439 --> 03:00.397
Oh, it'’s so good to see you.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.225
- Thank you.
- How are you? Oh, my God.

03:02.225 --> 03:04.096
The white Capri pants
are back.

03:04.096 --> 03:06.011
Oh, my God.
Where'’s Natalya?

03:07.970 --> 03:09.972
All I can say...

03:09.972 --> 03:12.496
Wow.

03:12.496 --> 03:14.063
I'’m just happy being
back on board with you.

03:14.063 --> 03:15.456
Yes, thank you.
Me, too. Great.

03:15.456 --> 03:17.501
You know,
Kyle'’s coming back, right?

03:17.501 --> 03:21.462
And the Chief Stew, they'’re
having an immigration issue now.

03:21.462 --> 03:22.724
They'’re trying
to get their visa.

03:22.724 --> 03:24.987
- Okay.
- I need you to take command.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.510
Easy.

03:26.510 --> 03:29.600
I got my chief and my second
stew stuck in immigration.

03:34.039 --> 03:35.345
Have you heard anything?

03:35.345 --> 03:37.304
<i>There'’s such a backlog
with visas.</i>

03:37.304 --> 03:40.350
<i>I almost swam all the way
there from here.</i>

03:40.350 --> 03:42.526
When it happens, it happens.
You'’re on board.

03:42.526 --> 03:44.180
In order to save
the charter season,

03:44.180 --> 03:45.181
I'’m starting with some temps.

03:45.181 --> 03:46.965
When the chief stew comes,

03:46.965 --> 03:48.445
you don'’t have a
problem stepping down?

03:48.445 --> 03:50.230
No, I'’m happy.
I'’m flexible.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.883
Thank you.

03:51.883 --> 03:53.798
Being that two of my crew aren'’t
going to make it on time,

03:53.798 --> 03:55.278
I had to make a
last minute decision

03:55.278 --> 03:56.975
on who I was going
to reach out to.

03:56.975 --> 03:59.848
I learned from my last season
that Natalya is a hard worker.

03:59.848 --> 04:01.197
She has a great attitude.

04:01.197 --> 04:03.286
The table'’s
absolutely beautiful.

04:03.286 --> 04:05.375
Thankfully, she just
became available.

04:05.375 --> 04:07.334
I'’m just so grateful
she could make it.

04:07.334 --> 04:08.683
It'’s a large vessel.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.076
Having four on the
interior is a must.

04:11.076 --> 04:13.122
But for now, three.

04:13.122 --> 04:14.863
- Yeah.
- So this is your second.

04:14.863 --> 04:16.821
- For now.
- Cocktails, bartender, okay.

04:16.821 --> 04:18.519
Well, that'’s great
to know for service.

04:18.519 --> 04:19.694
And then any third?

04:19.694 --> 04:22.610
Yes.
She'’s a temp stew.

04:25.177 --> 04:26.788
She'’s deck, primarily.

04:26.788 --> 04:29.530
So you'’re going to have to
teach her laundry or something.

04:29.530 --> 04:30.792
- That'’s okay.
- You have to teach her.

04:30.792 --> 04:32.446
Personally, I think
I'’m going to do

04:32.446 --> 04:34.448
a better job than anyone
that comes in.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.711
Last season,
Tash gave me some PTSD.

04:36.711 --> 04:38.321
Nat, you'’re just snappy
with everyone.

04:38.321 --> 04:39.888
Tash, I haven'’t
spoken to you in any way.

04:39.888 --> 04:42.456
No, don'’t disrespect me.
I don'’t stand for that.

04:42.456 --> 04:44.153
Do not shout at me.

04:44.153 --> 04:46.286
Natalya just wants my job.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.722
Yeah, that'’s it.

04:47.722 --> 04:49.419
But I love Captain Sandy.
We'’re very close.

04:49.419 --> 04:51.247
I'’d love to think that
I was her first option.

04:51.247 --> 04:53.205
But this has worked out now.

04:53.205 --> 04:55.425
- Welcome aboard.
- Okay.

05:00.778 --> 05:02.258
Stew diary.

05:02.258 --> 05:03.303
El Capitano.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.043
Hey, welcome.

05:05.043 --> 05:06.218
I'’m Jack, nice to meet you.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.263
Yeah, you too.

05:07.263 --> 05:09.700
Wow.
Beautiful.

05:09.700 --> 05:11.354
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

05:11.354 --> 05:13.269
I was trying to see.
Where did you train?

05:13.269 --> 05:14.270
- Oh, Liverpool.
- Liverpool.

05:14.270 --> 05:15.706
Yeah, yeah.

05:15.706 --> 05:17.273
I had a very strong foundation
in French cooking.

05:17.273 --> 05:18.883
My forté is sauces.

05:18.883 --> 05:20.407
I have been
a chef for 13 years,

05:20.407 --> 05:22.191
but I'’ve filled that 13 years.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.106
Like, I have not stopped
since I was 16.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.934
I'’ve travelled. When I went
to Asia for three years,

05:25.934 --> 05:27.588
I wasn'’t backpacking,
I was working.

05:27.588 --> 05:29.764
The initial reason for being
a chef was to travel.

05:29.764 --> 05:32.244
We didn'’t really have
the best diet growing up.

05:32.244 --> 05:33.768
Frozen meals and stuff.

05:33.768 --> 05:35.465
French fries from McDonald'’s.

05:37.685 --> 05:39.643
Even to this day, I think
if you like vegetables,

05:39.643 --> 05:41.776
if you genuinely
sit there, eat broccoli,

05:41.776 --> 05:43.430
and you like it, you'’ve got
something wrong with you.

05:43.430 --> 05:44.648
- Welcome aboard.
- Thanks, Captain.

05:44.648 --> 05:46.389
- I'’m excited.
- Yeah.

05:46.389 --> 05:47.782
That'’s so sweet.

05:47.782 --> 05:50.045
Hello.

05:50.045 --> 05:51.481
- Hi.
- How'’s it going?

05:51.481 --> 05:52.874
- I'’m Jack.
- Natalya, nice to meet you.

05:52.874 --> 05:54.179
Nice to meet you.

05:54.179 --> 05:55.790
- You'’re the chef.
- I'’m the chef, yeah.

05:55.790 --> 05:57.182
This is your room.
Let me get you your uniform.

05:57.182 --> 05:58.749
- All right, cool.
- Have you seen the galley?

05:58.749 --> 06:00.708
I have seen the galley.
It looks pretty good.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.144
- It does.
- Yeah, yeah.

06:02.144 --> 06:03.319
So I'’m just temp chief stew.

06:03.319 --> 06:04.973
You'’re temp chief stew?
Okay.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.627
Yeah, there'’s visa issues
with one of the girls coming.

06:06.627 --> 06:08.629
- Right.
- And then she'’ll take over.

06:08.629 --> 06:11.153
But for the first charter,
I think it'’s me and you.

06:11.153 --> 06:13.024
All right, me and
you against the world.

06:13.024 --> 06:14.286
- Me and you against the world.
- All right, let'’s do this.

06:14.286 --> 06:15.853
- Captain Sandy.
- Hi.

06:15.853 --> 06:18.073
- How are you?
- Good. Welcome aboard.

06:18.073 --> 06:19.161
Thank you.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.249
- All right.
- Just do it.

06:20.249 --> 06:21.729
Let'’s have a seat.

06:21.729 --> 06:24.514
So I like that you have
this 200 ton Yachtmaster.

06:24.514 --> 06:25.863
That'’s good.

06:25.863 --> 06:28.823
Tender driving in
10 to 15 foot swells.

06:28.823 --> 06:29.954
Yeah, yeah.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.478
We launched to do surf
in South Africa.

06:31.478 --> 06:33.393
So you have to drop
the boat on the sand,

06:33.393 --> 06:35.003
turn it around,
push it in the water.

06:35.003 --> 06:36.526
Yeah, that'’s awesome.

06:37.832 --> 06:39.529
Okay.
Wow, yeah, nice.

06:39.529 --> 06:41.183
Breaking waves or just rolling?

06:41.183 --> 06:42.750
Breaking waves.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.665
So when guests are in the
tender, you know how to like.

06:44.665 --> 06:46.493
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, that'’s good.

06:46.493 --> 06:49.060
I'’ve been bosun for
about three years now.

06:49.060 --> 06:51.019
I'’m from a small town
in South Africa.

06:51.019 --> 06:53.195
There wasn'’t much opportunity
growing up there.

06:53.195 --> 06:54.544
I grew up spearfishing.

06:54.544 --> 06:55.502
That'’s the way I made my money.

06:55.502 --> 06:56.981
I'’m 100% a water baby.

06:56.981 --> 06:59.593
As a bosun, leading people
is really important.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.464
So let'’s see how your
leadership skills are.

07:01.464 --> 07:04.641
It'’s like the saying a smooth
sea never made a skilled sailor,

07:04.641 --> 07:05.990
because that'’s where you grow.

07:05.990 --> 07:07.688
I ran away from home
super young,

07:07.688 --> 07:09.167
dropped out of school 16,

07:09.167 --> 07:11.474
grew up in an abusive
household, alcoholics.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.084
I'’m just a statistic.
No one cares.

07:13.084 --> 07:14.521
So I'’m like, I know
where I come from

07:14.521 --> 07:15.826
and I know where I want to go.

07:15.826 --> 07:19.047
So I have to take
my sh-- seriously.

07:19.047 --> 07:20.744
All right,
well, welcome aboard.

07:20.744 --> 07:22.398
- Thank you so much.
- You'’re welcome.

07:22.398 --> 07:23.878
Could have a party in here.

07:23.878 --> 07:26.054
- Hey.
- Hi, Natalya.

07:26.054 --> 07:27.490
Rue, nice to meet you.

07:27.490 --> 07:29.753
- Rue?
- Rue, just Rue, yeah.

07:29.753 --> 07:31.189
Rue.

07:31.189 --> 07:33.061
Feel like taking this?
This is the biggest one.

07:33.061 --> 07:34.715
Okay, perfect, yeah.

07:34.715 --> 07:37.195
We need Jesus at this point.
There'’s a lot to do.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.806
Hello. I'’m Natalya.

07:38.806 --> 07:40.460
- I'’m Jessika.
- Nice to meet you.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.505
I'’m your temp chief stew
at the moment.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.593
- Okay.
- Hello.

07:43.593 --> 07:44.899
- Jack.
- Lara.

07:44.899 --> 07:46.509
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

07:46.509 --> 07:48.119
So you'’re in here.

07:52.863 --> 07:53.908
Hello.

07:53.908 --> 07:55.083
Hello, who have I got here?

07:55.083 --> 07:58.826
- Lara, Lara.
- Nice to meet you.

07:58.826 --> 07:59.914
Where do I do it?
Down there.

07:59.914 --> 08:01.263
- Crew messes down there.
- Okay.

08:01.263 --> 08:02.569
- You'’re deck.
- Yes.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.527
Yeah, Okay, so this
is your bosun in there.

08:04.527 --> 08:05.876
- Rue.
- Rue, Okay, cool.

08:05.876 --> 08:07.399
You'’re going in this cabin,

08:07.399 --> 08:08.444
you'’re sharing
with another female.

08:08.444 --> 08:09.706
- All right.
- Okay, perfect.

08:09.706 --> 08:11.142
Let'’s go to the top
to bottom, girl.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.579
Let'’s be straight into it.

08:12.579 --> 08:13.580
- Hi.
- Hi.

08:13.580 --> 08:14.929
I'’m the bosun.

08:14.929 --> 08:16.191
- I'’m Haleigh.
- Rue, nice to meet you.

08:16.191 --> 08:17.192
Nice to meet you.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.541
The drinks here for the fridge.

08:18.541 --> 08:19.803
Ash trays.

08:19.803 --> 08:21.239
Put it in there
in her cabin.

08:21.239 --> 08:22.676
They said I'’m sharing
with a girl.

08:22.676 --> 08:24.286
- Maybe it'’s you.
- Okay.

08:24.286 --> 08:26.114
At least everything'’s
kind of in a place.

08:26.114 --> 08:27.550
- Meh.
- Meh.

08:27.550 --> 08:28.682
Meh.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.297
- How'’s it going?
- Welcome.

08:35.297 --> 08:36.385
Thanks, bro.
I'’m Luka.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.647
- Rue.
- Nice to meet you.

08:37.647 --> 08:39.040
- Lara.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

08:39.040 --> 08:40.432
Nice to meet you.

08:40.432 --> 08:41.608
That would be great if you
just start vac dusting

08:41.608 --> 08:43.044
and we'’ll just start wiping.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.045
Copy.

08:44.045 --> 08:44.872
- Hey.
- Hello.

08:44.872 --> 08:46.308
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

08:46.308 --> 08:48.136
It'’s quite a nice,
Large Marge boat, huh?

08:48.136 --> 08:49.572
Yeah, it is.

08:49.572 --> 08:51.574
So what was it like working
for Captain Jason?

08:51.574 --> 08:53.054
Oh my God, it was so much fun.

08:53.054 --> 08:54.490
Yeah?

08:54.490 --> 08:56.361
All righty.

08:56.361 --> 08:58.712
Mate, I'’m proud that
you actually just took it on,

08:58.712 --> 09:00.191
helping out the interior,

09:00.191 --> 09:02.367
your deck knowledge,
your engineering knowledge.

09:02.367 --> 09:04.674
So good having someone with
some experience, man.

09:04.674 --> 09:06.154
You definitely got the ability

09:06.154 --> 09:07.938
to keep going
wherever you want to go.

09:07.938 --> 09:08.852
Yeah.

09:08.852 --> 09:10.158
Well, he highly recommended you.

09:10.158 --> 09:11.246
Really?

09:11.246 --> 09:12.595
So I'’m very excited about this.

09:14.336 --> 09:16.817
I was on two other boats,
and they were both private.

09:16.817 --> 09:19.950
So I'’m actually an ETO,
like, electrical engineer.

09:19.950 --> 09:21.648
But I just really
enjoy being on deck.

09:21.648 --> 09:23.737
Like, engineers,
they'’re just way too grumpy.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.173
And I'’m not a grumpy guy.

09:25.173 --> 09:26.478
I want to have fun.

09:26.478 --> 09:28.219
Go find Natalya.
She'’ll point out your cabin.

09:28.219 --> 09:29.612
- Okay.
- Welcome aboard.

09:29.612 --> 09:31.005
- Awesome.
- I'’m thrilled to have you.

09:31.005 --> 09:32.267
- Thank you so much.
- We got a bunch of boots.

09:32.267 --> 09:33.660
Hey, girls.

09:33.660 --> 09:35.357
- So, it'’s us?
- Are you on deck as well?

09:35.357 --> 09:37.838
- Yes.
- Okay, okay.

09:37.838 --> 09:39.056
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

09:39.056 --> 09:40.710
- Nice to meet you.
- Who are you?

09:40.710 --> 09:42.973
- I'’m Luka.
- Luka, Natalya. How are you?

09:42.973 --> 09:44.148
- Good.
- New Zealand?

09:44.148 --> 09:45.846
- Yeah. You?
- I'’m Australian.

09:45.846 --> 09:47.021
- Aussie.
- You can'’t tell the accent?

09:47.021 --> 09:48.631
- Oh, my God.
- We'’re related.

09:48.631 --> 09:49.763
We'’re basically related.

09:49.763 --> 09:51.112
All crew, all crew,

09:51.112 --> 09:53.680
our MCA officer
will be here in about one hour.

09:53.680 --> 09:54.724
Bosun locker.

09:54.724 --> 09:56.030
That'’s all your stuff.

09:56.030 --> 09:58.380
And then straight away,
go find the bosun.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.511
Okay.

09:59.511 --> 10:01.862
Luka just has
this, like, ugh.

10:01.862 --> 10:04.691
Like, it'’s like the eyes,
the smile.

10:04.691 --> 10:07.998
He'’s like Balinese surfer
scooter boy.

10:07.998 --> 10:10.087
I don'’t know.
Mixed with God.

10:10.087 --> 10:12.524
- Okay, thank you.
- Sure thing.

10:12.524 --> 10:13.874
He'’s so hot.

10:13.874 --> 10:15.266
So you guys, no shammy,

10:15.266 --> 10:17.051
so we can get one of
those shammys there?

10:17.051 --> 10:18.879
I feel like I'’ve never
even actually used a shammy.

10:18.879 --> 10:21.621
How long have you
been a deckhand?

10:21.621 --> 10:25.537
I'’m deckhands on, like, ships
and, like, tugs and stuff.

10:25.537 --> 10:26.974
Oh, really?

10:26.974 --> 10:28.671
So, like, yachting, like,
I don'’t even know.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.281
Is this your first,
like, time on a yacht?

10:30.281 --> 10:31.369
Yeah.

10:31.369 --> 10:32.980
My dad wanted a son.

10:32.980 --> 10:36.461
He did everything in his power
to make sure I was boy-like.

10:36.461 --> 10:39.900
Soccer, basketball,
softball, rugby growing up.

10:39.900 --> 10:42.685
I think that'’s why I started
working on tugs.

10:42.685 --> 10:44.252
The whole yachting industry.

10:44.252 --> 10:46.167
is something I
just wanted to try.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.690
You get all your money
done in one month.

10:47.690 --> 10:49.649
You go home, drink beers
or something.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.911
Kind of sounds great.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.261
Excuse me.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.480
There'’s still one more deck
crew that'’s going to come.

10:55.480 --> 10:56.699
Hopefully it'’s a girl.

10:56.699 --> 10:59.267
We can have a whole
girl deck team.

10:59.267 --> 11:01.443
- Hey, bro.
- Bosun.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.619
- Yes, sir.
- Sweet.

11:03.619 --> 11:06.448
We'’re just going to rinse
and soap a bit of this area.

11:06.448 --> 11:09.277
So we'’re going to work
from forward backwards.

11:09.277 --> 11:12.410
- Hello.
- Hi. How are you?

11:12.410 --> 11:14.543
Like I said, I don'’t know
how to----ing do this.

11:14.543 --> 11:16.414
Just feel it out
with this thing, eh?

11:18.155 --> 11:20.114
- This is the crew list.
- Okay.

11:22.333 --> 11:24.858
These are hard copies.

11:24.858 --> 11:27.556
This season,
it'’s completely different.

11:27.556 --> 11:31.125
Stepping on Mustique at
989 gross tons

11:31.125 --> 11:32.735
after coming off
Motor Yacht Home

11:32.735 --> 11:34.737
is a huge adjustment for me.

11:34.737 --> 11:36.957
Mustique'’s a commercial
built vessel.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.611
It'’s solid.
It'’s steel. It's heavy.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.918
And it'’s a full displacement,
massive yacht.

11:41.918 --> 11:43.833
We'’re in a whole
different ballgame now.

11:46.836 --> 11:49.056
And plus, we'’re in a major port.

11:49.056 --> 11:52.320
Ships come in and out and
transfer passengers and goods.

11:52.320 --> 11:54.975
In this port, because
it'’s so highly regulated,

11:54.975 --> 11:57.368
an MCA officer can board
the vessel at any time.

11:57.368 --> 12:00.284
And it'’s all about the
safe operation of the vessel.

12:00.284 --> 12:03.374
From life rafts to certificates
that we have to hold,

12:03.374 --> 12:06.290
that is their job to make
sure that we'’re safe.

12:13.123 --> 12:15.299
Ruan, Ruan. Can you please
come to the bridge?

12:15.299 --> 12:17.258
Copy that, Captain.
I'’m on my way.

12:19.869 --> 12:21.436
Yes, Captain.

12:21.436 --> 12:23.046
How are you?

12:23.046 --> 12:24.831
Making sure you hydrate.
It'’s hot out there.

12:24.831 --> 12:26.093
- Drink lots of water.
- I need some water.

12:26.093 --> 12:27.137
My mouth'’s so dry.

12:27.137 --> 12:28.443
So where are your originals?

12:28.443 --> 12:29.879
Good to meet you.

12:29.879 --> 12:31.925
My originals are, I leave
them in a safe at home.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.884
So I made certified copies
by the police station.

12:41.935 --> 12:44.372
I can try and get
them sent, yeah.

12:44.372 --> 12:45.634
Because the reality
is that you should

12:45.634 --> 12:47.679
always have the originals.

12:47.679 --> 12:50.770
- Honestly, that'’s...
- Yeah, I get it.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.121
That'’s a problem.

12:56.906 --> 12:57.864
Coming up...

12:57.864 --> 12:59.561
Like me having to guide her

12:59.561 --> 13:01.389
while I'’m trying
to do my duties.

13:01.389 --> 13:03.870
Her not seeing a list
of what she needs to do,

13:03.870 --> 13:05.349
and that'’s the problem.

13:05.349 --> 13:06.829
Jess needs to chill
the [bleep] out.

13:06.829 --> 13:08.048
And later...

13:08.048 --> 13:09.745
The entire vessel
could be arrested

13:09.745 --> 13:11.399
because of one crew member.

13:22.540 --> 13:23.585
You got to get your original.

13:25.979 --> 13:27.284
My life is a little bit more
tricky than that.

13:27.284 --> 13:28.851
I don'’t really have parents
and stuff.

13:28.851 --> 13:30.635
So my card'’s at
this friend'’s house.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.550
This is at that, I'’ve been in
France for eight years straight.

13:32.550 --> 13:34.291
I'’ve been in South Africa
for three months

13:34.291 --> 13:36.032
- in the last eight years.
- Where are those located?

13:36.032 --> 13:38.643
Those are in the safe
at a friend'’s house.

13:38.643 --> 13:39.862
In Cape Town.

13:43.735 --> 13:46.173
So you need to get a hold of
your friend and mail your stuff.

13:46.173 --> 13:47.478
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- So do that.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.784
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

13:48.784 --> 13:49.785
We'’re great.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.265
That'’s not okay.

13:51.265 --> 13:53.833
We'’re in a bind
for the MCA officer.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.790
He wants originals.

13:54.790 --> 13:55.878
There'’s a reason why.

13:55.878 --> 13:57.575
You can'’t forge an original.

14:01.666 --> 14:03.973
If we don'’t get this
certs in five days...

14:06.628 --> 14:07.977
Okay.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.500
Sh---show.

14:09.500 --> 14:11.372
This will be for
cold towels tomorrow.

14:11.372 --> 14:12.895
We'’ll get that for
the third stew.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.679
At the moment,
you'’re second stew.

14:14.679 --> 14:15.855
Okay.

14:15.855 --> 14:17.769
I find comfort in people.

14:17.769 --> 14:20.860
It'’s like, okay,
who'’s gonna be my friend?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.992
Like, I grew up in Hawaii

14:22.992 --> 14:25.168
and I was always at
my best friend'’s house.

14:25.168 --> 14:27.170
She was very much of
a leader and she'’s like,

14:27.170 --> 14:29.172
we'’re gonna go to dinner,
we'’re gonna go do this,

14:29.172 --> 14:30.173
we'’re gonna do that.

14:30.173 --> 14:31.479
And I was like, okay.

14:31.479 --> 14:33.785
I felt comfortable
in that situation.

14:33.785 --> 14:36.005
So I guess that'’s why
I'’m a strong second stew.

14:36.005 --> 14:38.007
I'’m a good follower.

14:38.007 --> 14:40.531
So they'’re gonna
switch out her later?

14:40.531 --> 14:43.708
She'’s only temp helping us,
and then she'’s leaving.

14:43.708 --> 14:45.536
But you'’re not gonna
be the chief stew.

14:45.536 --> 14:46.668
No.

14:46.668 --> 14:48.975
I just had a call
from the Capitano

14:48.975 --> 14:50.237
a couple days ago to come here

14:50.237 --> 14:51.716
because they couldn'’t
get her visa.

14:51.716 --> 14:53.109
So I was like, yep, I can
fly to Europe tomorrow.

14:53.109 --> 14:55.068
- Oh.
- Yeah.

14:55.068 --> 14:56.808
Did you soap these already?

14:56.808 --> 14:58.158
- Yeah.
- Okay.

14:58.158 --> 14:59.550
That just needs
to be rinsed.

14:59.550 --> 15:01.726
- Ah, [bleep]'’s sakes.
- What'’s up?

15:01.726 --> 15:03.728
For eight years, I'’ve been
working on the yachts.

15:03.728 --> 15:06.209
I'’ve never taken my original
certificates on board with me.

15:06.209 --> 15:07.602
So they got certified copies.

15:07.602 --> 15:09.299
Now the guy'’s saying no,
they need the originals.

15:09.299 --> 15:10.953
Yeah, I'’ve always
taken my originals.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.998
Yeah.

15:11.998 --> 15:13.738
Okay, so where were we?

15:13.738 --> 15:16.524
Just do stairs and then
we'’ll start this area here.

15:24.010 --> 15:25.794
So what got you into
working on boats?

15:25.794 --> 15:28.188
I'’ve been wanting to do it
since I was young.

15:28.188 --> 15:30.581
I'’ve always been like
surfing and in the water.

15:34.629 --> 15:35.673
Yeah.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.980
I grew up on a farm
in South Africa.

15:37.980 --> 15:40.156
My family is so conservative.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.637
Like, if I say [bleep],
my mom would start crying.

15:44.204 --> 15:46.815
My family memory of, like,
growing up on the farm

15:46.815 --> 15:51.733
was the cattle, moving them from
the stable to go get milked.

15:51.733 --> 15:53.604
And I don'’t know what it is...

15:56.303 --> 15:59.132
You know, different colors
from light green to dark green

15:59.132 --> 16:01.264
to light brown, dark brown.

16:01.264 --> 16:02.700
But it'’s amazing.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.876
We used to run into it
and just dive

16:04.876 --> 16:08.315
and play and it'’s warm
and nice and it'’s...

16:12.580 --> 16:13.320
Oh.

16:13.320 --> 16:14.799
Would you never get...

16:14.799 --> 16:18.020
I wouldn'’t open my mouth
or put it in any holes.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.022
But at that age,
you don'’t care, you know.

16:20.022 --> 16:21.937
Now I wouldn'’t do it.

16:21.937 --> 16:25.332
But, well, I was drunk enough,
I'’d probably do it.

16:26.724 --> 16:27.987
Why do you want to do the yacht?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.511
I want to try it out.
Everything once.

16:30.511 --> 16:31.729
Okay.

16:31.729 --> 16:32.992
You should see, I took
the forward cabin,

16:32.992 --> 16:34.297
the smallest one.

16:34.297 --> 16:35.646
Me and my man are going
to be in there.

16:35.646 --> 16:37.997
Oh, your man, Kyle.
What happened to Storm?

16:37.997 --> 16:40.216
I'’m gonna miss you.

16:40.216 --> 16:41.522
Things naturally fell apart.

16:41.522 --> 16:42.827
And now he'’s got a girlfriend,

16:42.827 --> 16:44.133
but I'’ve met someone now.

16:44.133 --> 16:45.830
And we started being together,

16:45.830 --> 16:48.224
but he wants an
open relationship.

16:48.224 --> 16:49.921
Open is dating others.

16:49.921 --> 16:53.838
He'’s not dating others.
He is, um...

16:53.838 --> 16:55.623
You know what I mean?

16:55.623 --> 16:57.842
I don'’t understand that.

16:57.842 --> 17:00.323
My certified copies
were scanned and emailed,

17:00.323 --> 17:02.499
so I left everything
in South Africa

17:02.499 --> 17:04.762
because I'’ve already----ing
sent it, you know?

17:04.762 --> 17:06.851
I don'’t understand why they
couldn'’t sort it up earlier.

17:06.851 --> 17:08.157
Yeah, bro, that'’s----ed.

17:08.157 --> 17:09.985
So if you could just give
me the stuff

17:09.985 --> 17:11.769
to send it
to get those certificates.

17:11.769 --> 17:13.075
But it is stupid, I mean,

17:13.075 --> 17:14.294
because sending it from
South Africa takes

17:14.294 --> 17:15.686
ing time to get here.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.862
Yeah, I'’ve always
taken my originals.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.212
Thanks.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.870
All crew, all crew.
We got provisions on the dock.

17:25.870 --> 17:27.524
This is where the fun starts.

17:27.524 --> 17:28.351
Okay.

17:28.351 --> 17:29.831
Look at her showing off.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.398
- For the interior.
- Interior.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.616
- Provision'’s here.
- Provision'’s are here.

17:32.616 --> 17:34.096
Oh, my God.

17:34.096 --> 17:35.141
I'’m probably better staying
in the galley for this.

17:35.141 --> 17:36.490
Yes, all right.

17:36.490 --> 17:38.709
- More schnipz.
- Oh, my God. So much sh--.

17:38.709 --> 17:39.841
Just take your time

17:39.841 --> 17:41.060
and put your stuff
where you need it.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.322
Yeah.

17:42.322 --> 17:43.671
We have plenty of
space to put food.

17:44.802 --> 17:46.978
Every job I have at first,

17:46.978 --> 17:48.850
I'’m always very anxious
and on edge.

17:54.943 --> 17:56.684
And it'’s like, when I got
to eight years old,

17:56.684 --> 17:59.208
I just woke up and
I'’ve got no memory before then.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.385
And I haven'’t stopped
yapping since.

18:02.385 --> 18:05.127
- Oh, here you go.
- Thank you.

18:05.127 --> 18:06.389
Thank you.

18:09.958 --> 18:10.915
Okay.

18:10.915 --> 18:12.787
That is one big boat.

18:12.787 --> 18:14.832
Hello.
Can I help you?

18:14.832 --> 18:16.486
Sure, that would be awesome.

18:16.486 --> 18:18.445
- I'’m Lara.
- I'’m Brooke.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.838
<i>Natalya, your new
stewardess has arrived.</i>

18:20.838 --> 18:22.057
Copy that.

18:22.057 --> 18:23.058
- Yes.
- It'’s really heavy.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.581
What do you have in here, girl?

18:24.581 --> 18:25.713
A lot.

18:25.713 --> 18:27.193
Well, this is our
last minute zone.

18:27.193 --> 18:28.368
So let'’s keep
unpacking up there.

18:28.368 --> 18:31.197
What the [bleep] is in here?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.589
- Is it Brooke?
- Yes.

18:32.589 --> 18:34.635
- I'’m Natalya.
- Hi, I'’m Brooke.

18:34.635 --> 18:35.549
Welcome.

18:35.549 --> 18:36.680
Where did you just come from?

18:36.680 --> 18:37.725
Miami.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.161
Working on yachts
or just holiday?

18:39.161 --> 18:40.945
Yeah, I moved there
looking for a job.

18:40.945 --> 18:43.774
I'’m not usually a stewardess.

18:43.774 --> 18:46.342
I am usually a deckhand.

18:46.342 --> 18:49.345
Mostly just on smaller
sailboats and yachts.

18:49.345 --> 18:52.479
I haven'’t been on
anything this big before.

18:52.479 --> 18:55.873
This is the first, like,
live-aboard that I'’ve been on.

18:55.873 --> 19:00.791
I'’m excited, but
I'’m sh--ting my pants.

19:00.791 --> 19:02.576
Yeah, just get dressed and
then come up to the galley.

19:02.576 --> 19:03.968
It'’s just right up
the stairs there.

19:03.968 --> 19:05.274
Okay.

19:05.274 --> 19:06.319
All deck crew,
could we meet on the bow?

19:06.319 --> 19:07.798
Just for a little team meeting.

19:07.798 --> 19:09.800
<i>I'’m coming, too.
I want to do distances.</i>

19:09.800 --> 19:11.367
I want to go over
everything with you.

19:11.367 --> 19:12.890
<i>Copy that, Captain.</i>

19:15.545 --> 19:20.637
So distances, how far is from
this boat to that barge?

19:20.637 --> 19:21.812
50 meters?

19:21.812 --> 19:23.553
- No.
- No, 75.

19:23.553 --> 19:24.728
100 meters.

19:24.728 --> 19:26.469
That'’s right.
That'’s 100 meters.

19:26.469 --> 19:29.646
Ruan'’s distance calling
for me is concerning.

19:29.646 --> 19:31.170
Not good.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.694
It'’s important that you know.

19:33.694 --> 19:35.304
We don'’t want to hit anything,

19:35.304 --> 19:36.566
because it will end
our charter season

19:36.566 --> 19:37.611
and our jobs will be done.

19:37.611 --> 19:39.221
Anything under three meters,

19:39.221 --> 19:42.311
I care, because that
gives me time to...

19:42.311 --> 19:44.183
- Too, yeah.
- Escape.

19:44.183 --> 19:46.097
- Hi, I'’m Brooke.
- Jessika.

19:46.097 --> 19:47.186
Nice to meet you.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.231
- You too, roomie.
- Yeah.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.541
No, it'’s nice.

19:54.541 --> 19:56.238
Okay, gay is
better than lesbian.

19:56.238 --> 19:58.066
Lesbian sounds horrible.

19:58.066 --> 19:59.241
I hate that word.

19:59.241 --> 20:01.156
- Guys stink.
- They do stink.

20:01.156 --> 20:02.636
And they piss everywhere.

20:02.636 --> 20:04.507
Just don'’t like it when
someone comes to me like,

20:04.507 --> 20:05.987
oh, you'’re also a lesbian.

20:05.987 --> 20:07.206
Oh, you'’re a lesbian.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.382
off.
You know, what are you?

20:09.382 --> 20:12.559
Get out, get one on
the nose, anyway.

20:14.343 --> 20:16.171
- Thank you, Lara.
- You'’re welcome.

20:16.171 --> 20:18.347
And Haleigh doing it like
she'’s done it her whole life.

20:18.347 --> 20:21.698
I know.
I might just be like a cleaner.

20:21.698 --> 20:23.352
A cleaner? Do you want to be
a stewardess, then?

20:23.352 --> 20:24.962
Oh, no, [bleep] that.

20:26.137 --> 20:27.704
All crew, all crew.

20:27.704 --> 20:30.272
<i>Maybe in the sky lounge for
the captain'’s meeting.</i>

20:30.272 --> 20:31.665
We'’re gathering here.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.059
Come, brother.

20:35.059 --> 20:36.060
Welcome aboard.

20:36.060 --> 20:37.323
It'’s great to have you.

20:37.323 --> 20:39.238
We got a lot of women
here on deck.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.891
For me, that'’s a highlight.

20:40.891 --> 20:44.025
So I'’m just going to get the
pleasantries out of the way.

20:44.025 --> 20:45.722
Absolutely no drugs.

20:45.722 --> 20:47.376
You can'’t drink on charter.

20:47.376 --> 20:48.812
No racist comments.

20:48.812 --> 20:51.641
See this?
Never take it away.

20:51.641 --> 20:53.077
Because I really like it.

20:53.077 --> 20:54.557
It'’s called a smile.

20:54.557 --> 20:56.907
I'’m going to introduce our
chief engineer, Toni,

20:56.907 --> 20:58.692
and chief officer, Nikola.

20:58.692 --> 20:59.997
Honestly, we'’re going
to rock this.

20:59.997 --> 21:01.042
100%.

21:01.042 --> 21:03.697
And get your certificates.

21:03.697 --> 21:05.089
- Let'’s make it rain.
- Please don'’t say that.

21:05.089 --> 21:07.004
- Oh, [bleep].
- Thank you.

21:07.004 --> 21:08.179
Let'’s do this.

21:08.179 --> 21:09.659
Okay, let'’s go smash this sh--.

21:09.659 --> 21:11.618
Are we doing this side?
Are we doing main deck tomorrow?

21:11.618 --> 21:12.619
- Yeah.
- Stunning.

21:12.619 --> 21:15.796
Oh, for God'’s sake.

21:15.796 --> 21:16.797
Is this us?

21:18.451 --> 21:20.017
Stew pantry.

21:20.017 --> 21:21.889
I can'’t believe it's nearly
nine o'’clock.

21:21.889 --> 21:23.107
I know.

21:23.107 --> 21:24.108
Take that downstairs, though.

21:24.108 --> 21:25.414
Or in that hole.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.546
Because we'’re going
to do the cabins.

21:26.546 --> 21:29.331
- What are you saying?
- Sorry.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.941
Because we'’re going to vacuum.

21:30.941 --> 21:31.986
All right, coming down.

21:31.986 --> 21:33.248
I'’ll grab the bucket.

21:33.248 --> 21:35.729
Don'’t forget to
get around the bed.

21:35.729 --> 21:36.817
Legendary.

21:36.817 --> 21:39.080
- Are we done?
- You guys rock. man.

21:39.080 --> 21:41.604
<i>Natalya, Ruan, and Jack.</i>

21:41.604 --> 21:42.866
Let'’s meet in the crew mess
for our

21:42.866 --> 21:44.825
very first
preference sheet meeting.

21:44.825 --> 21:46.479
<i>Copy.</i>

21:46.479 --> 21:48.350
Oh, my God.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.221
Right.

21:50.221 --> 21:52.311
This charter client is
Kian Karimi,

21:52.311 --> 21:54.443
my personal friend and doctor.

21:54.443 --> 21:56.097
Over the pandemic, he turned 40.

21:56.097 --> 21:58.360
He is excited
to finally celebrate in style

21:58.360 --> 21:59.753
with his best friend.

21:59.753 --> 22:03.060
Kian will be joined by
Cameron, Jesus,

22:03.060 --> 22:05.062
Gerardo, Nathan, and Carl.

22:05.062 --> 22:06.325
So it'’s an all boys trip.

22:06.325 --> 22:07.369
- All boys.
- Woo.

22:07.369 --> 22:08.849
They'’re my favorite.

22:08.849 --> 22:11.155
Expect to have access to all
the water sports toys.

22:11.155 --> 22:12.896
Yeah.

22:12.896 --> 22:14.158
So the minute we drop anchor,
you'’re launching all the toys.

22:14.158 --> 22:15.246
Perfect.

22:15.246 --> 22:16.683
Dinner on night one.

22:16.683 --> 22:18.380
The primary will be
celebrating his birthday.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.730
He has requested
a coastal Italian meal.

22:20.730 --> 22:23.429
He also requests that
Captain Sandy joins.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.344
I mean, be prepared.

22:25.344 --> 22:26.649
I'’m thrown in the deep end.

22:26.649 --> 22:28.825
That'’s like my...
That is my story.

22:28.825 --> 22:31.480
Having Kian on board
is incredible.

22:31.480 --> 22:33.917
I went to see Kian
because years ago

22:33.917 --> 22:36.529
I was in a car crash
and my right eye

22:36.529 --> 22:38.357
didn'’t really
close all the way.

22:38.357 --> 22:41.534
So he took some skin
from this eye,

22:41.534 --> 22:43.405
he added it to this eye

22:43.405 --> 22:45.494
and now my eyelid
closes all the way.

22:45.494 --> 22:47.191
He fixed my eye.

22:47.191 --> 22:49.411
I'’m glad you're on board.
I'’ll see you tomorrow.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.674
Try not to wake up too early
because you have a long day.

22:51.674 --> 22:53.807
That'’s right.
Get your certs.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.286
I promise you they'’re coming.

22:55.286 --> 22:56.331
Great.
That'’s awesome.

22:56.331 --> 22:57.680
Thank you, Captain.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.856
I don'’t want to wash
this boat anymore.

22:59.856 --> 23:01.684
I can'’t believe it
took us that long.

23:01.684 --> 23:02.729
Yeah.

23:11.259 --> 23:13.174
Oh, my [bleep].

23:13.174 --> 23:15.829
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

23:15.829 --> 23:17.831
Rue, Rue, Luka.

23:17.831 --> 23:19.093
Oh, no.

23:22.923 --> 23:24.925
Where is this guy?

23:29.930 --> 23:31.671
Hey, brother.

23:38.025 --> 23:39.330
Yeah.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.331
You all good, brother?

23:40.331 --> 23:41.594
Oh, [bleep].

23:44.379 --> 23:48.601
, bro.
I'’m so sorry.

23:48.601 --> 23:50.429
ing sh--.

23:55.346 --> 23:56.522
ing hell.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.741
- You just found out now?
- Yeah.

24:04.268 --> 24:05.574
So sorry, bro.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.315
I feel like I'’m gonna
pass out.

24:07.315 --> 24:09.143
Deep breaths.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.504
Good night.

24:22.504 --> 24:23.766
Good night, love.

24:30.077 --> 24:32.514
Son, you'’re probably going
to hit your head over there.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.994
Oh, most definitely.

24:33.994 --> 24:35.517
Oh, sh--.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.432
What was that?

24:37.432 --> 24:39.434
My phone charger.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.400
Oh, yeah.

25:08.594 --> 25:09.986
Ow, [bleep]!

25:14.077 --> 25:16.819
- Feel better?
- Yeah, I'’m good, thanks.

25:16.819 --> 25:18.821
I appreciate you, bro.
Thank you so much.

25:18.821 --> 25:20.301
All right, I got you.

25:20.301 --> 25:23.173
My friend passing away,
he was not just a friend.

25:23.173 --> 25:25.524
That is a brother that,
good or bad,

25:25.524 --> 25:26.960
he was by my side.

25:26.960 --> 25:28.527
If I think back
since eight years old,

25:28.527 --> 25:30.311
every memory is with that guy.

25:30.311 --> 25:32.139
I didn'’t really
grow up with parents.

25:32.139 --> 25:33.619
My dad died when
I was young, so

25:33.619 --> 25:35.055
it wasn'’t really
about family,

25:35.055 --> 25:36.665
it was more about
friends that I grew up with.

25:36.665 --> 25:39.407
And right now, I don'’t
even know where my heads at.

25:39.407 --> 25:41.017
I don'’t know what to think
or to feel.

25:41.017 --> 25:43.106
I'’ve lost someone that
means so much to me.

25:43.106 --> 25:45.152
The first person to
phone you in the morning

25:45.152 --> 25:46.588
and find out how
you'’re feeling.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.504
The last person you speak to.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.723
You know, that'’s all gone.

25:58.382 --> 26:00.384
We'’re going to jump straight
into it this morning.

26:00.384 --> 26:03.736
Guest cabins, someone
vacuum, someone wipe.

26:03.736 --> 26:05.172
And then I'’ll come join you.

26:05.172 --> 26:06.652
Is there washing
liquid in here?

26:06.652 --> 26:08.871
The shampoo is still up
on the fly.

26:11.613 --> 26:12.875
What does that do?

26:12.875 --> 26:14.660
It'’s supposed to
release the wrinkles.

26:14.660 --> 26:16.836
Uh-huh.

26:16.836 --> 26:19.839
I'’m not a teacher.
I'’m a follower.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.275
Are you okay with
vac dusting?

26:22.624 --> 26:24.191
Yes.

26:24.191 --> 26:25.671
Because I just want to kind
of wash this and... see this?

26:25.671 --> 26:27.194
We need to get this all off.

26:27.194 --> 26:28.151
Yeah.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.243
All good, all good,
all good.

26:33.243 --> 26:35.724
I'’m sweating like a
whore in church right now.

26:36.899 --> 26:38.248
Oh, my God, dude.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.383
Everything'’s looking
pretty sweet.

26:42.383 --> 26:45.429
Yeah, I just did a bit of a
walk around, we'’re looking good.

26:45.429 --> 26:46.996
Beds look crisp.

26:46.996 --> 26:48.519
Let'’s get it.

26:48.519 --> 26:50.304
All crew, all crew.
Guests arrival in 30 minutes.

26:50.304 --> 26:51.914
Beautiful.

26:51.914 --> 26:54.961
<i>Interior, interior.
Change into your whites.</i>

26:54.961 --> 26:57.964
The boat looks amazing.
Well done.

27:00.749 --> 27:03.230
Hey, Luka. Can you come put
my epaulets on for me?

27:03.230 --> 27:04.840
Put me to work, don'’t you?

27:04.840 --> 27:06.450
I wonder what the first
one'’s going to be like.

27:06.450 --> 27:07.800
Hopefully they'’re fun.

27:09.932 --> 27:11.020
Look at that thing, dude.

27:11.020 --> 27:12.413
Clase, do a shot in each.

27:12.413 --> 27:14.981
Chef, you'’re next
to me on this side.

27:14.981 --> 27:16.199
- Looks like a beauty.
- Love it.

27:16.199 --> 27:17.331
Here we go.

27:17.331 --> 27:18.506
- Let me get somewhere.
- Are you ready?

27:18.506 --> 27:19.594
Yes!

27:19.594 --> 27:20.813
Here'’s the crew.

27:20.813 --> 27:22.249
Are you 40 years young?

27:22.249 --> 27:24.381
That'’s right.
You got it.

27:24.381 --> 27:26.732
So good to see you.
Oh, my God.

27:26.732 --> 27:27.733
Good to see you, too.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.256
So excited to be here.

27:29.256 --> 27:32.172
I'’m Natalya, chief stew
for the trip.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.652
Cameron, Kian'’s little brother.

27:33.652 --> 27:35.088
- Tito, pleasure.
- Nice to meet you.

27:35.088 --> 27:36.567
I'’m going to show you
the best time ever.

27:36.567 --> 27:38.308
We'’re going to launch
every toy we can for you

27:38.308 --> 27:40.223
and the crew are going
to show you a good time.

27:40.223 --> 27:42.617
- All right.
- Welcome.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.923
I like what I see!

27:43.923 --> 27:44.924
It'’s shot o'clock.

27:44.924 --> 27:46.142
Oh, thank you.

27:46.142 --> 27:47.622
Is there a weight limit
on that thing?

27:47.622 --> 27:49.189
If I go down, don'’t rescue me.

27:52.018 --> 27:53.149
Yacht life.

27:53.149 --> 27:54.760
Do you want to go
for a tour?

27:54.760 --> 27:55.804
- Let'’s do it.
- All right.

27:55.804 --> 27:56.849
Beautiful.

27:56.849 --> 27:58.502
The bridge deck aft.

27:58.502 --> 28:00.461
This is where
you'’re going to have

28:00.461 --> 28:02.724
a majority of your meals,
weather dependent.

28:02.724 --> 28:04.726
Where are you going?

28:04.726 --> 28:06.206
Welcome to the sun deck.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.034
So how many people can
we fit in that?

28:08.034 --> 28:09.862
- The more, the merrier.
- Nice.

28:09.862 --> 28:11.341
We can all fit
in there, dude.

28:21.003 --> 28:24.050
We'’re going down
to the guest cabin area.

28:24.050 --> 28:26.313
Oh.

28:26.313 --> 28:28.054
I'’ll settle nicely
into my quarter.

28:28.054 --> 28:30.143
- Will this be a good fit?
- This will be acceptable.

28:30.143 --> 28:31.405
Are we going to see
the kitchen, too?

28:31.405 --> 28:32.754
You want to go see the galley?
Sure.

28:32.754 --> 28:34.147
So where do we take them now?

28:34.147 --> 28:36.149
The girls will tell us
which rooms they go to.

28:36.149 --> 28:37.672
If you guys want unpacking,
let me know.

28:37.672 --> 28:40.544
If you want pressing,
let me know, and we can steam.

28:40.544 --> 28:42.024
We have lots of pressing needs.

28:42.024 --> 28:43.678
That'’s great.
We love a good press.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.201
- Hello.
- Hello.

28:45.201 --> 28:47.769
- You'’ve got visitors.
- Welcome to my dungeon.

28:47.769 --> 28:49.597
Oh!

28:49.597 --> 28:51.425
No pressure,
but in the couple of days

28:51.425 --> 28:52.818
we'’ve been in Italy,
we'’ve had about

28:52.818 --> 28:55.472
20 collective
Michelin stars.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.431
We'’re really looking forward
to seeing what you can do.

28:57.431 --> 28:59.389
I'’m excited myself,
I'’m gonna be honest.

29:07.963 --> 29:08.964
Let'’s go.
Yeah, let'’s go out.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.183
Okay.

29:10.183 --> 29:12.228
Hi, this is Sandy.

29:22.412 --> 29:23.892
I'’m going to scan it while
you'’re on the phone.

29:23.892 --> 29:25.328
Hang on one second.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.205
Oh, my goodness.

29:33.554 --> 29:35.382
You'’ve got to be
freaking kidding me.

29:35.382 --> 29:39.386
This is someone else'’s picture
on Ruan'’s certificate.

29:39.386 --> 29:40.517
This is major.

29:40.517 --> 29:42.215
This is, like,
a whole different level.

29:42.215 --> 29:43.869
This is not okay.

29:43.869 --> 29:45.609
The entire vessel
could be arrested

29:45.609 --> 29:47.263
because of one crew member.

29:48.482 --> 29:49.613
Wow.

29:54.618 --> 29:57.752
Oh, my goodness.
That'’s not...

29:57.752 --> 29:59.275
That'’s not him.

30:01.930 --> 30:03.149
Oh, it could get detained.

30:03.149 --> 30:04.454
The entire vessel
could be arrested

30:04.454 --> 30:05.891
because of one crew member.

30:05.891 --> 30:07.414
Wow.

30:07.414 --> 30:09.111
Well, thank you for bringing
this to my attention.

30:09.111 --> 30:11.592
I will take care of it.
I appreciate your time.

30:11.592 --> 30:12.723
Salud.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.725
Hey.

30:14.725 --> 30:16.553
As soon as we get
food on the table,

30:16.553 --> 30:19.121
you'’re going to go down
straight into Cabins,

30:19.121 --> 30:20.122
Master is priority.

30:20.122 --> 30:21.428
He wants unpacking.

30:21.428 --> 30:22.908
If you get everything on
a coat hanger.

30:22.908 --> 30:24.126
Threads...

30:24.126 --> 30:26.041
<i>Rue, Rue, please come
to the bridge.</i>

30:26.041 --> 30:27.956
Copy that, Captain.
En route.

30:27.956 --> 30:29.436
Hey.

30:29.436 --> 30:30.480
Are you guys gonna be ready
to sit

30:30.480 --> 30:32.047
in five minutes to have lunch?

30:32.047 --> 30:33.309
- Wow.
- That'’s amazing.

30:33.309 --> 30:34.441
When are we going
to leave port?

30:34.441 --> 30:35.877
I couldn'’t find Captain Sandy,

30:35.877 --> 30:37.618
but hopefully we'’ll take
off soon for our cruise.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.185
Grazi.

30:39.185 --> 30:40.751
<i>Interior, interior,
we'’re going to seat the guests</i>

30:40.751 --> 30:44.277
down in five minutes so
we will need all hands

30:44.277 --> 30:46.322
to run the platters
from the galley.

30:46.322 --> 30:47.410
Where'’s my captain?

30:47.410 --> 30:48.672
I needed one of these.

30:48.672 --> 30:51.632
I think we'’re departing
in one hour.

30:51.632 --> 30:52.938
You think we'’re departing
in one hour?

30:52.938 --> 30:54.591
Yes.

30:54.591 --> 30:56.115
I thought it was just get on a
yacht and go wherever you want.

30:56.115 --> 30:58.160
- I guess that'’s not the case.
- Yeah.

30:58.160 --> 30:59.945
So, most likely leaving
in one hour.

30:59.945 --> 31:01.033
Okay.

31:01.033 --> 31:02.034
I'’m going to hold you to that.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.426
Pasta in there.

31:03.426 --> 31:04.906
Couple of salads and
a couple of capreses.

31:04.906 --> 31:06.734
I don'’t know how
I'’m going to give people breaks

31:06.734 --> 31:08.040
on the first day.

31:08.040 --> 31:09.345
Don'’t worry about that.
We'’re on charter.

31:09.345 --> 31:11.782
Hey, have a seat.

31:11.782 --> 31:17.571
So, the officer
just had me scan this.

31:17.571 --> 31:18.354
Yeah?

31:18.354 --> 31:19.703
Is this really you?

31:21.140 --> 31:22.445
Yeah, yeah, 100%.

31:25.796 --> 31:27.450
Like, who is that guy?

31:29.278 --> 31:31.933
Whoever issued this,
it'’s not yours.

31:31.933 --> 31:34.153
It'’s this other guy.

31:34.153 --> 31:35.328
Where did you go to school?

31:35.328 --> 31:36.720
On one of the boats.

31:36.720 --> 31:38.984
We needed it because
the ticket expired.

31:38.984 --> 31:40.942
So, we needed to get
a ticket done quickly.

31:40.942 --> 31:44.467
The guy came on the boat
and he issued us all tickets.

31:44.467 --> 31:47.209
To get this, you have
to go to class.

31:47.209 --> 31:48.341
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

31:48.341 --> 31:49.733
Did you go to a school?

31:51.213 --> 31:52.301
Pardon?
Yeah, yeah.

31:52.301 --> 31:53.302
You have to be honest with me.

31:53.302 --> 31:54.869
No, no, I am.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.349
I mean, honestly,
if you didn'’t go to a class...

31:56.349 --> 31:59.221
- I did do all that.
- Where? What school?

31:59.221 --> 32:03.965
In Monaco, we still had our
practical on a boat in Monaco.

32:03.965 --> 32:05.619
No.

32:05.619 --> 32:09.971
You can'’t get your Yachtmasters
on a boat in Monaco.

32:12.017 --> 32:14.976
They don'’t have
a school in Monaco.

32:14.976 --> 32:17.152
Big red flag.

32:17.152 --> 32:18.980
What the [bleep] does that mean?

32:18.980 --> 32:21.461
I'’ve been on boats for three
years with that same ticket.

32:21.461 --> 32:23.463
I swear to God,
the last thing on my mind

32:23.463 --> 32:25.378
that the ticket was false.

32:25.378 --> 32:26.901
Everything'’s a bit...

32:26.901 --> 32:29.208
We'’re gonna have to
leave you on the dock.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.992
- Yeah.
- Let'’s verify this.

32:30.992 --> 32:33.821
If it'’s verified, then a tender
will bring you to the boat.

32:33.821 --> 32:35.301
Yeah.

32:35.301 --> 32:37.564
If it isn'’t, then I can't
bring you back on board.

32:37.564 --> 32:38.565
Yeah.

32:38.565 --> 32:40.393
Unfortunately, we gotta move.

32:40.393 --> 32:44.832
So, go ahead and get your
stuff and then, uh...

32:44.832 --> 32:45.964
Oh, [bleep].

32:45.964 --> 32:48.270
I gotta get the,
uh, boat off the dock.

32:51.143 --> 32:53.232
Okay.

32:53.232 --> 32:54.798
I'’m a factual person.

32:54.798 --> 32:58.237
Like, I'’m seeing what I see.

32:58.237 --> 32:59.368
This is a problem.

32:59.368 --> 33:01.066
Sometimes mistakes happen.

33:01.066 --> 33:04.591
However, I'’m kind of thinking
this isn'’t the case here.

33:04.591 --> 33:06.723
Regardless, this is really bad.

33:06.723 --> 33:08.638
And I'’m in a horrible situation

33:08.638 --> 33:10.640
having to start
the first charter

33:10.640 --> 33:12.816
without a chief stew
and now a bosun.

33:17.082 --> 33:18.648
If you were a kitchen appliance,

33:18.648 --> 33:20.824
what kitchen appliance
would you be?

33:22.739 --> 33:23.697
Scissor.

33:23.697 --> 33:24.654
It'’s not an appliance, though.

33:24.654 --> 33:25.699
That'’s, like, a tool.

33:25.699 --> 33:27.266
- Scissor.
- But I get that.

33:27.266 --> 33:29.746
- Scissoring.
- Yeah, I know. I got it.

33:30.878 --> 33:31.792
It'’s fitting.

33:31.792 --> 33:33.446
- Are those salads ready?
- Yeah.

33:33.446 --> 33:34.838
So, if someone can run
those four

33:34.838 --> 33:36.318
just behind the bar
on the bridge deck

33:36.318 --> 33:37.493
that would be great.

33:37.493 --> 33:38.973
- One'’s a caprese salad.
- Yeah.

33:38.973 --> 33:40.279
And the other one,
make sure you say kale to him.

33:40.279 --> 33:41.671
He really likes kale.

33:41.671 --> 33:43.064
I'’ve seen the guests
like Italian food.

33:43.064 --> 33:44.892
So, we'’re in Italy.

33:44.892 --> 33:46.589
We'’ve got the best tomatoes.
We'’ve got the best mozzarella.

33:46.589 --> 33:48.635
We'’ve got the best fish.
Perfect meat.

33:48.635 --> 33:50.332
As a chef, I do believe
the natural beauty

33:50.332 --> 33:52.030
will come through.

33:52.030 --> 33:54.467
You don'’t need to [bleep] about
trying to make swans and stuff.

33:54.467 --> 33:56.121
ing lamb chops
are my favorite thing

33:56.121 --> 33:57.296
in the whole world.

33:57.296 --> 33:59.515
- Salud.
- We'’ve manifested.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.482
- Caprese salad.
- Awesome.

34:09.482 --> 34:12.659
And this is a quinoa, beetroot
and kale salad as well.

34:12.659 --> 34:14.269
It'’s a very Italian lunch.

34:14.269 --> 34:17.098
It'’s a nice way to start,
you know, being in Italy.

34:17.098 --> 34:19.274
First thing we'’re going to
do is drop the jet skis.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.493
This goes on here.

34:20.493 --> 34:23.104
Luka, can you come
to the bridge?

34:23.104 --> 34:24.410
The actual [bleep].

34:24.410 --> 34:27.152
Hey, what'’s up, brother?

34:27.152 --> 34:30.155
Problems with the Yachtmaster.

34:30.155 --> 34:32.374
- Hey.
- Have a seat.

34:32.374 --> 34:33.680
What can I do for you?

34:33.680 --> 34:36.117
Okay.
So, I'’ve had an incident.

34:36.117 --> 34:38.902
I have to leave Rue at the dock.

34:38.902 --> 34:43.603
And until he can verify his
documentation, I don'’t know.

34:43.603 --> 34:47.607
I don'’t... I don't...
I'’m not sure.

34:47.607 --> 34:50.044
So, what I need is
an interim bosun.

34:50.044 --> 34:52.090
Whoa. What?

34:54.092 --> 34:55.789
Yeah, sure, I don'’t mind
stepping up and helping out.

34:55.789 --> 34:58.400
- Wow.
- Thank you for helping me.

34:58.400 --> 34:59.575
I'’ll tell the crew.

34:59.575 --> 35:00.663
Just don'’t say anything yet.

35:00.663 --> 35:01.925
- Okay, thank you.
- Bye.

35:01.925 --> 35:03.840
I have to get this
boat off the dock.

35:03.840 --> 35:05.190
We'’re down crew members.

35:05.190 --> 35:06.974
I don'’t really have
a lot of choices.

35:06.974 --> 35:10.195
Luka'’s my best choice
because his CV is impeccable

35:10.195 --> 35:12.849
and Captain Jason
said he was excellent.

35:12.849 --> 35:15.374
When another captain
recommends a crew member,

35:15.374 --> 35:16.853
you go with what
the captain says.

35:16.853 --> 35:18.855
Would you like some branzino?

35:18.855 --> 35:19.769
Oh, yes, please.

35:19.769 --> 35:22.598
Look at how he plated that.

35:22.598 --> 35:24.165
Lamb lollypops. Beautiful.

35:24.165 --> 35:25.558
Thank you.
They can go.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.081
The crust is amazing.

35:27.081 --> 35:30.215
Lamb lollypop?

35:30.215 --> 35:31.390
That'’s great.
Thank you.

35:31.390 --> 35:33.043
- Hey!
- Hello, guys.

35:33.043 --> 35:34.349
The fish was amazing.

35:34.349 --> 35:35.350
- Was it?
- Yes.

35:35.350 --> 35:36.569
Thank you.

35:36.569 --> 35:38.223
This is not
your average lunch.

35:38.223 --> 35:39.528
I'’ve got plenty more of it
as well if you want more fish,

35:39.528 --> 35:40.964
more lamb, everything.

35:47.623 --> 35:48.929
Cheers, guys.

35:48.929 --> 35:50.757
The chef has set a
very high bar.

35:50.757 --> 35:52.846
If you want to get
and check in on Brooke?

35:52.846 --> 35:54.369
Shirt.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.676
But just make sure she'’s,
like, picking up the pace.

35:56.676 --> 35:58.417
- Yeah.
- That'’s nice.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.158
Great.
Everything'’s amazing.

36:00.158 --> 36:01.507
Thank you, guys.

36:01.507 --> 36:03.117
Today is getting
used to the boat.

36:03.117 --> 36:04.249
So you'’re the first.
What'’s your title?

36:04.249 --> 36:05.641
- Chief stew.
- Well done.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.208
How are you doing?

36:07.208 --> 36:11.430
I wasn'’t sure how
to hang pants, but...

36:11.430 --> 36:13.780
Just decide which...

36:13.780 --> 36:15.738
I don'’t think folding
is one of my specialties.

36:15.738 --> 36:17.958
Um, you know how
to fold socks?

36:20.830 --> 36:22.919
- Um...
- I'’ll just show you quickly.

36:22.919 --> 36:25.792
I knew Brooke is
green on the boat,

36:25.792 --> 36:28.403
but she'’s, like,
green in real life.

36:28.403 --> 36:29.622
- Fold them.
- Okay.

36:29.622 --> 36:32.146
- Like that.
- Just roll it up.

36:32.146 --> 36:33.191
She is bright green.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.714
Just make it make
sense, honestly.

36:34.714 --> 36:37.020
T-shirts, shorts,
make it make sense, girl.

36:37.020 --> 36:38.370
Okay.

36:38.370 --> 36:40.372
Rue, have you heard when
we'’re getting underway?

36:40.372 --> 36:44.332
Um, pretty soon, but I'’m not
going to be with you guys.

36:44.332 --> 36:45.464
You'’re leaving.

36:45.464 --> 36:47.161
I'’m definitely going
to come back,

36:47.161 --> 36:48.902
but I'’ve got to rush because
you guys are going to leave.

36:48.902 --> 36:51.470
What the [bleep] is going on?

36:51.470 --> 36:54.777
Like, we just got here.

36:54.777 --> 36:57.519
Okay?
Like, do you need help?

36:57.519 --> 37:00.435
I want to try and get those
original certificates and stuff.

37:00.435 --> 37:01.828
What'’s going on?

37:01.828 --> 37:03.177
- Uh...
- Are you leaving?

37:03.177 --> 37:05.310
- Yeah.
- And then I'’ll come back.

37:05.310 --> 37:06.485
Okay.

37:06.485 --> 37:08.269
Are we leaving the
dock today?

37:08.269 --> 37:09.575
Yeah, now, soon.

37:09.575 --> 37:11.098
This is cool.

37:11.098 --> 37:12.839
Oh, [bleep]!
In the water!

37:14.188 --> 37:15.494
What the [bleep]?

37:15.494 --> 37:17.191
Oh, my God.

37:17.191 --> 37:18.148
You know...

37:19.237 --> 37:20.325
Are they?

37:20.325 --> 37:21.717
How long are you
going to be gone for?

37:21.717 --> 37:23.415
Well, I just got to get
one, two documents in

37:23.415 --> 37:26.461
then I can get the tender
to bring me to the boat.

37:26.461 --> 37:27.984
For someone to
show up to a yacht

37:27.984 --> 37:30.770
without original certificates
is very weird.

37:30.770 --> 37:32.598
Like, if you get pulled
over by the cops

37:32.598 --> 37:35.078
and you show a photocopy
version of your license,

37:35.078 --> 37:37.124
like, what do you think
they'’re going to do?

37:37.124 --> 37:38.473
What happened?

37:38.473 --> 37:41.737
If he gets his STCW
and something else sorted,

37:41.737 --> 37:43.173
he can come back on board.

37:43.173 --> 37:45.524
So it'’s us three going
to leave the dock?

37:45.524 --> 37:47.613
- Adios, amigo.
- Are you all right?

37:47.613 --> 37:49.919
He didn'’t even give me a hug. Nothing.

37:55.316 --> 37:57.318
What happened?

37:57.318 --> 37:59.842
If he gets his STCW and
something else sorted,

37:59.842 --> 38:01.540
he can come back on board.

38:01.540 --> 38:03.019
That is so----ing...

38:03.019 --> 38:05.283
So it'’s us three going
to leave the dock.

38:05.283 --> 38:08.634
Going into the first
charter, I'’m scared.

38:08.634 --> 38:10.244
We'’re a man down.

38:10.244 --> 38:12.115
It'’s only me and Luka
that really knows

38:12.115 --> 38:13.595
what a super yacht is like.

38:13.595 --> 38:15.336
Sh--'’s going to go down.

38:15.336 --> 38:17.817
Anything we can do?

38:17.817 --> 38:19.035
Okay, yeah.

38:20.385 --> 38:21.342
Okay.

38:26.347 --> 38:27.653
- Yeah.
- Hey.

38:27.653 --> 38:29.263
Hi.

38:29.263 --> 38:31.570
So, I was thinking about me
and Haleigh on the stern.

38:31.570 --> 38:35.356
- Okay.
- And then Lara up forward

38:35.356 --> 38:37.053
Are we getting a hand
from Chief Officer?

38:37.053 --> 38:38.838
Since you'’re back there,
I'’m fine.

38:38.838 --> 38:40.361
So he can help on the bow.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.798
It looks like it'’s going
to be a difficult trip

38:42.798 --> 38:44.147
for the three of us now.

38:44.147 --> 38:46.106
This will be my first
time being bosun.

38:46.106 --> 38:47.760
I am nervous.
My main focus is

38:47.760 --> 38:49.675
to try not to crash the
boat leaving the dock.

38:49.675 --> 38:51.633
Like, what the [bleep]?

38:51.633 --> 38:53.200
How are we going to do this?

38:53.200 --> 38:54.897
Pilot'’s coming, so put
the pilot ladder out.

38:54.897 --> 38:56.159
- Okay, cool.
- Thank you.

38:56.159 --> 38:57.378
Thank you.

38:57.378 --> 38:59.075
Can'’t believe Rue's
off the boat.

38:59.075 --> 39:00.468
Guys feel safe out there?

39:00.468 --> 39:02.427
Obviously, one man down.

39:02.427 --> 39:04.124
I feel like...

39:09.912 --> 39:11.697
Hey, love,
can I have three beers?

39:11.697 --> 39:13.394
- Yeah.
- So that'’s all his.

39:13.394 --> 39:14.526
And then this is all...

39:14.526 --> 39:15.962
This is one guy still.

39:15.962 --> 39:17.224
We'’ve got the beer.

39:17.224 --> 39:18.965
Does Captain Sandy
have an update

39:18.965 --> 39:21.097
on if we'’re going to depart?

39:22.490 --> 39:23.883
Roger that.

39:23.883 --> 39:26.886
Luka, Luka, pilot'’s
coming in 10 minutes.

39:26.886 --> 39:29.410
This port we'’re in
is a commercial port.

39:29.410 --> 39:31.412
And because we'’re over
500 gross tons,

39:31.412 --> 39:34.110
we need a pilot on board
every time we depart the dock

39:34.110 --> 39:35.895
and every time we come
back to the dock.

39:35.895 --> 39:38.027
Pilots are like
live Google maps.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.334
They know the other
traffic in the marina.

39:40.334 --> 39:42.771
Chief engineer, please
light up our engines.

39:42.771 --> 39:43.946
Thank you very much.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.384
Copy.

39:46.384 --> 39:47.776
Thank you.

39:56.524 --> 39:57.482
Hi.

39:57.482 --> 39:58.918
- How are you?
- Good?

39:58.918 --> 40:00.833
I'’m going to take it out here.

40:00.833 --> 40:02.965
Bow, we can drop
starboard spring line.

40:02.965 --> 40:04.358
I'’m going to do
the springs first.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.055
Springs first.

40:06.055 --> 40:07.448
Sandy, Nicola is on the stern.
I'’m going to go up to the bow.

40:07.448 --> 40:08.797
No, you need to be back there.

40:08.797 --> 40:10.277
One of the girls can
come up front with Toni.

40:10.277 --> 40:11.452
- Copy.
- I'’ll go.

40:11.452 --> 40:12.453
You want to go?

40:12.453 --> 40:13.323
I'’m coming up, Luka.

40:13.323 --> 40:15.761
Oh, [bleep].
Here we go.

40:15.761 --> 40:17.763
Yeah, go ahead.
Release the spring lines

40:17.763 --> 40:18.851
and then the cross lines.

40:18.851 --> 40:20.069
Releasing.

40:22.594 --> 40:24.857
You'’re just dropping it?

40:24.857 --> 40:26.467
<i>You can release
the ground line.</i>

40:26.467 --> 40:27.337
Releasing.

40:27.337 --> 40:29.470
- Yeah!
- We cut the cord?

40:29.470 --> 40:31.907
Sandy, we got the lines
on the stern.

40:35.911 --> 40:38.653
Ciao, Bella.
Woo!

40:38.653 --> 40:40.960
<i>Starboard side about 5 meters.</i>

40:40.960 --> 40:42.744
Here we go.

40:42.744 --> 40:44.442
- Ciao.
- Arrivederci.

40:44.442 --> 40:46.879
Hey, Haleigh, can I get a
hand with the tender

40:46.879 --> 40:48.271
on the starboard bow?

40:48.271 --> 40:50.796
- Should I deflate the fenders?
- Yeah, for sure.

40:50.796 --> 40:52.711
Thankfully, we'’re getting
help from an engineer,

40:52.711 --> 40:55.714
but for the rest of the season,
we definitely need someone else.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.411
Because, like, this
port'’s----ing huge.

40:57.411 --> 40:59.065
There'’s so many super yachts.

40:59.065 --> 41:01.197
There'’s so many little
boats driving around.

41:01.197 --> 41:05.114
Like, if you [bleep] up,
it'’s going to be on the news.

41:05.114 --> 41:06.507
And I'’m going to be the guy
on the stern,

41:06.507 --> 41:10.816
like, uh, okay, you just
- ing hit the dock.

41:10.816 --> 41:12.644
Just get it down
there quickly.

41:12.644 --> 41:13.645
Nice one.

41:13.645 --> 41:15.168
What is the speed in here?

41:19.955 --> 41:21.522
Okay, thank you.

41:21.522 --> 41:23.002
Yes, thank you.

41:23.002 --> 41:25.265
That'’s the pilot.
That'’s the pilot, dude.

41:25.265 --> 41:28.660
<i>The pilot is disembarking.
The pilot is disembarking.</i>

41:28.660 --> 41:29.617
Copy that.

41:30.705 --> 41:31.663
Bye!

41:31.663 --> 41:33.316
Good, nice work.

41:33.316 --> 41:35.841
You know, I saw the red flags
with Rue in the beginning,

41:35.841 --> 41:37.277
but I didn'’t have a choice.

41:37.277 --> 41:39.366
A department head is
so hard to come by,

41:39.366 --> 41:40.889
especially in the middle
of the med season.

41:40.889 --> 41:43.370
I think it'’s like a 0.5%

41:43.370 --> 41:45.633
that Rue could provide
his certificates.

41:45.633 --> 41:47.940
Fingers crossed, Norma
can come through for us.

41:47.940 --> 41:51.596
Otherwise, we'’re screwed.
We'’re totally screwed.

41:51.596 --> 41:54.076
Which plate would you
like for tonight?

41:54.076 --> 41:55.425
The birthday extravaganza.

41:55.425 --> 41:56.731
We could do that starter,
that main.

41:56.731 --> 41:57.732
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

41:57.732 --> 41:59.299
How are you guys doing?

41:59.299 --> 42:01.562
Wagyu beef and lobster
for the main course.

42:03.085 --> 42:04.130
Yeah, legend.

42:04.130 --> 42:05.479
There you go, sir.
My pleasure.

42:05.479 --> 42:09.222
This goddamn radio,
so much sh-- on me.

42:09.222 --> 42:11.093
I feel like a Christmas tree.

42:14.619 --> 42:15.576
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

42:15.576 --> 42:17.230
Hey, Sandy. Hey.

42:17.230 --> 42:20.059
So, we'’re not going to set up
any water stuff, are we?

42:20.059 --> 42:21.277
No, it'’s too late.

42:21.277 --> 42:23.236
Is it okay if Lara
goes down now?

42:23.236 --> 42:24.890
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

42:24.890 --> 42:26.239
I'’m going to go
put my blacks on.

42:26.239 --> 42:27.588
- Look at that.
- Hi.

42:27.588 --> 42:28.720
You guys are still
okay for beverages?

42:28.720 --> 42:30.025
We'’re good.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.244
I'’m going to freshen up
for dinner.

42:31.244 --> 42:32.593
It'’s at 9:10.
Is that okay?

42:32.593 --> 42:33.594
It'’s great.

42:40.993 --> 42:41.994
- Perfect.
- Thank you.

42:41.994 --> 42:42.995
- Looks good, bro.
- Aw!

42:42.995 --> 42:44.300
You'’re done.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.433
- And then I'’m up at 4.
- In the morning.

42:46.433 --> 42:48.000
- Goodnight, honey.
- Thank you.

42:49.567 --> 42:50.742
Good to drop.

42:50.742 --> 42:52.308
I'’m just going to
keep an eye on this

42:52.308 --> 42:54.136
and I'’ll call it every
time I see a color.

42:54.136 --> 42:56.443
Great, because I don'’t know
what the [bleep] I'’m doing.

42:56.443 --> 42:59.446
You'’re watching colors as well,
so you'’ll know when to stop.

42:59.446 --> 43:00.795
Okay.

43:00.795 --> 43:02.101
51 meters, we'’re going
to go to five shackles.

43:02.101 --> 43:03.450
Copy that.

43:03.450 --> 43:05.104
I'’m freaking out on the inside.

43:05.104 --> 43:06.409
Like, I'’ve got
the technical skills.

43:06.409 --> 43:08.020
I know how everything works.

43:08.020 --> 43:10.152
It'’s just I've never
had to manage a full team.

43:10.152 --> 43:12.111
That'’s five shackles.

43:12.111 --> 43:13.721
Inside, I'’m sh--ing myself.

43:13.721 --> 43:16.376
For now, you know, it'’s
fake it '’til you make it, so...

43:16.376 --> 43:18.900
Coming up to a long stay,
one o'’clock.

43:18.900 --> 43:20.380
Okay, great.
You can lock it down.

43:20.380 --> 43:21.163
Copy.

43:21.163 --> 43:23.339
<i>Nice work, everyone.</i>

43:23.339 --> 43:26.299
It'’s going to be an
amazing night, dude.

43:26.299 --> 43:27.343
I like mine well done.

43:27.343 --> 43:29.084
- Six ounces.
- No worries.

43:29.084 --> 43:31.521
It'’s surf and turf, so it's
going to be a few slices.

43:31.521 --> 43:32.697
It'’s not going to be like
a full steak.

43:32.697 --> 43:34.307
You'’re killing it.

43:34.307 --> 43:37.092
Having Jack on board,
he'’s got a big act to follow.

43:37.092 --> 43:39.312
Twice-cooked octopus
with pea puree and sesame.

43:39.312 --> 43:40.966
Wow.

43:40.966 --> 43:42.837
David.

43:42.837 --> 43:44.056
Oh, that'’s so cool.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.100
Looks amazing.

43:45.100 --> 43:46.145
That'’s impressive, David.

43:46.145 --> 43:47.581
You'’ve outdone yourself.

43:47.581 --> 43:48.974
Wow.

43:48.974 --> 43:50.671
With everything that'’s
happened with interior

43:50.671 --> 43:52.542
and exterior, I just hope
dinner goes well for my friend.

43:52.542 --> 43:54.327
- At least we got off the dock.
- Eventually.

43:54.327 --> 43:55.676
They must be happy.

43:59.288 --> 44:01.682
- Coming up...
- Did you leave Brooke a list?

44:01.682 --> 44:03.597
She'’s going to get very
overwhelmed with it.

44:03.597 --> 44:06.644
Excuse me.
We'’re splitting the same tip.

44:12.475 --> 44:15.043
Where'’s the dinner?
Is it up here or down there?

44:15.043 --> 44:16.697
Bridge deck aft.

44:16.697 --> 44:18.917
Thank you.

44:18.917 --> 44:20.832
Oh, fancy.

44:20.832 --> 44:22.790
Wow.

44:22.790 --> 44:25.575
Thank you.

44:25.575 --> 44:27.316
- We made it.
- We made it.

44:27.316 --> 44:28.709
- Hey, Jess.
- Hello.

44:28.709 --> 44:30.189
I'’m going to start
dressing us now.

44:30.189 --> 44:32.408
Okay, guys.
So, synchronized service.

44:32.408 --> 44:33.845
We'’re just all going
to walk up there.

44:33.845 --> 44:35.324
So, you'’re going
to serve them from the right

44:35.324 --> 44:36.804
and just look at me.

44:36.804 --> 44:39.546
So, I'’ll get to the head
of the table, and then...

44:39.546 --> 44:41.809
None of us really know
your whole story.

44:41.809 --> 44:44.246
Honestly, this career for me,

44:44.246 --> 44:46.553
I feel like it saved
my life in a way.

44:46.553 --> 44:49.077
I was a good kid,
and then my neighbor

44:49.077 --> 44:51.427
gave me a 714 Quaalude.

44:51.427 --> 44:52.254
Oh.

44:52.254 --> 44:53.691
And that changed my life.

44:53.691 --> 44:56.476
I was on that drug train.
I kept getting arrested.

44:56.476 --> 44:58.086
All right.
What have we got ourselves here?

44:58.086 --> 44:59.740
So, seared Yellowfin tuna,

44:59.740 --> 45:02.612
Thai ginger dressing, pickled
beet root, and quail'’s egg.

45:02.612 --> 45:03.483
Okay.

45:03.483 --> 45:05.441
And one day, I woke up,

45:05.441 --> 45:07.922
and it was just
another groundhog day.

45:07.922 --> 45:10.446
And then you'’re going
to be white and chicken.

45:10.446 --> 45:11.621
- Okay.
- Let'’s go.

45:11.621 --> 45:13.275
- And I got sober.
- Cold turkey.

45:13.275 --> 45:14.755
- You decided?
- I got help.

45:14.755 --> 45:15.974
Well, you got
professionals helping you.

45:15.974 --> 45:17.323
Yeah.

45:17.323 --> 45:18.672
I mean, that'’s
the important thing,

45:18.672 --> 45:21.022
because it takes
a professional to, you know,

45:21.022 --> 45:23.329
go through the transitions.

45:23.329 --> 45:25.810
I answered an ad in the paper
to pay off all my fines,

45:25.810 --> 45:27.637
and I started washing boats.

45:27.637 --> 45:30.640
And I think because
I had so many chances,

45:30.640 --> 45:33.818
Now I feel like my job
is to mentor people.

45:33.818 --> 45:35.776
How many chances do
you give someone?

45:35.776 --> 45:37.082
- Three.
- Three chances.

45:37.082 --> 45:38.779
- And they'’re gone.
- Yeah.

45:38.779 --> 45:40.738
Sandy, that'’s admirable.

45:40.738 --> 45:43.044
Captain Sandy'’s well
done, by the way.

45:43.044 --> 45:44.350
Yeah.

45:44.350 --> 45:47.875
I hate touching people'’s
chewed up food.

45:47.875 --> 45:49.485
I like doing deck work.

45:49.485 --> 45:51.313
You know, we'’ve all
washed dishes before.

45:51.313 --> 45:53.489
I hate every minute of it.

45:53.489 --> 45:55.840
Gruntwork is what
I know how to do.

45:55.840 --> 45:57.015
This is excellent.

45:57.015 --> 45:58.799
- Oh my God!
- Delicious.

45:58.799 --> 46:00.279
Thank you so much.

46:01.715 --> 46:03.978
Look at that, bro.
Are you kidding me?

46:03.978 --> 46:06.459
- Can'’t rush perfection.
- Wow.

46:06.459 --> 46:09.505
This is stunning. Do you want
to come up for this one?

46:09.505 --> 46:12.334
Wagyu tomahawk, poached lobster,
truffle and madera au jus.

46:12.334 --> 46:14.249
Beautiful.

46:14.249 --> 46:15.468
- So good.
- Delicious.

46:15.468 --> 46:17.557
- Amazing.
- Wow.

46:17.557 --> 46:18.819
So, let me show you quickly.

46:18.819 --> 46:19.820
Yeah, okay.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.213
Nice one, brother.

46:21.213 --> 46:24.259
Flip it back like this.
Turn down the bed.

46:24.259 --> 46:25.826
Bathrooms, just quickly
wipe the shower.

46:25.826 --> 46:27.045
It doesn'’t
have to be perfect.

46:27.045 --> 46:28.524
It'’s just wipe, wipe, wipe.

46:28.524 --> 46:29.612
And that'’s it.

46:29.612 --> 46:31.266
It'’s not complicated work.

46:31.266 --> 46:34.835
It'’s just something
I'’ve never really done before.

46:34.835 --> 46:36.315
Oh, Mylanta.

46:36.315 --> 46:39.840
I would love to be
a captain one day.

46:39.840 --> 46:43.539
My dad was a captain.

46:43.539 --> 46:47.587
He has been the biggest
motivation in my life.

46:47.587 --> 46:50.895
My dad came up with
Sprouts grocery store.

46:50.895 --> 46:52.853
He passed away last year.

46:52.853 --> 46:55.856
He always told us, do something
that'’s going to make you happy.

46:55.856 --> 46:59.077
And yet, here I am,
on the inside.

46:59.077 --> 47:00.687
You have to start somewhere.

47:00.687 --> 47:03.908
She didn'’t teach me what
to do with two pillows.

47:03.908 --> 47:06.345
So...

47:06.345 --> 47:07.476
Are you finished with yours?

47:07.476 --> 47:09.043
I'’m all done.
Thank you.

47:09.043 --> 47:10.088
How is everything, guys?

47:10.088 --> 47:11.567
Excellent.
Thanks.

47:11.567 --> 47:14.353
- All right, birthday boy.
- Oh, yay.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.528
I think there'’s
a surprise coming.

47:15.528 --> 47:20.402
♪ Happy birthday to you

47:20.402 --> 47:26.582
♪ Happy birthday dear Kian

47:26.582 --> 47:32.197
♪ Happy birthday to you

47:32.197 --> 47:35.765
I wish I was on
a yacht in Portofino.

47:35.765 --> 47:37.898
Whoa!

47:37.898 --> 47:40.770
I'’m just gonna plate this up
and I'’ll be right back.

47:40.770 --> 47:41.902
That was awesome.

47:47.429 --> 47:48.691
Come on, wrinkles.

47:48.691 --> 47:51.477
Today I ate three
pieces of cucumber.

47:51.477 --> 47:52.782
That'’s why you're so thin.

47:52.782 --> 47:55.046
No, I swear to God,
baby'’s got back.

47:55.046 --> 47:56.917
Wait '’til you see me throw
it back on the D floor.

48:01.139 --> 48:03.445
What'’s the matter with you?

48:03.445 --> 48:04.969
No, I want to get
some sleep tonight.

48:04.969 --> 48:08.059
I like a Chief Stew who'’s
very supportive of the chef.

48:08.059 --> 48:10.888
Sometimes when
the team'’s understaffed

48:10.888 --> 48:12.454
and you'’re thrown
in the deep end,

48:12.454 --> 48:13.934
that'’s when the biggest
teams come together

48:13.934 --> 48:15.414
and work well together.

48:15.414 --> 48:16.850
I think that'’s what happened
with me and Natalya.

48:16.850 --> 48:18.634
I think she'’s really rise
to the challenge

48:18.634 --> 48:20.288
and she has actually really
impressed me, to be honest.

48:20.288 --> 48:22.247
- Let'’s go.
- Okay, thanks.

48:22.247 --> 48:24.945
Okay, this bed
was my Everest.

48:24.945 --> 48:26.294
Yeah, I'’m gonna raise
a glass to Sandy.

48:26.294 --> 48:27.382
Cheers.
Thank you.

48:27.382 --> 48:28.688
Yes, cheers.

48:28.688 --> 48:31.169
- Captain.
- Oh, dessert'’s coming.

48:31.169 --> 48:32.300
Oh, God.

48:32.300 --> 48:34.433
- This looks so good.
- Yes.

48:36.174 --> 48:37.262
This is so good.

48:37.262 --> 48:38.741
It'’s ridiculous.

48:38.741 --> 48:40.308
I'’m very happy with myself
and the interior.

48:40.308 --> 48:41.875
I feel like we smashed it out.

48:41.875 --> 48:44.617
The boat'’s looking good,
service has gone smoothly.

48:44.617 --> 48:46.836
If the interior team can
smash this out of the park

48:46.836 --> 48:48.621
and I get a gold star
from Captain Sandy,

48:48.621 --> 48:49.839
I'’ll be loving life.

48:49.839 --> 48:51.754
- Thanks for dinner.
- Yes, thank you.

48:51.754 --> 48:53.191
- I really appreciate it.
- Happy birthday.

48:53.191 --> 48:54.192
Thank you.

48:54.192 --> 48:55.933
- Okay.
- Nice work.

48:55.933 --> 48:56.977
Thank you.

48:56.977 --> 48:58.109
Carl, you wanna go
to the hot tub?

48:58.109 --> 48:59.110
yeah.

48:59.110 --> 49:00.154
Night, night, Brooke.

49:00.154 --> 49:01.199
I just finished.

49:01.199 --> 49:02.374
Thank you, you can go to bed.

49:02.374 --> 49:03.810
What the [bleep]?

49:03.810 --> 49:05.029
What time should I be
up in the morning?

49:05.029 --> 49:06.856
Seven and a half hours.

49:06.856 --> 49:08.946
And I'’ll put you down
for longer tomorrow.

49:13.298 --> 49:15.953
- It was excellent.
- Was it? Thanks.

49:15.953 --> 49:18.172
Well done.
You'’re really good.

49:18.172 --> 49:19.173
Thanks.

49:19.173 --> 49:21.001
Thank God it'’s gone well.

49:21.001 --> 49:22.350
Woo!

49:22.350 --> 49:24.004
I'’ve cooked all
around the world.

49:24.004 --> 49:26.354
I won the Michelin knife
and fork award when I was 23.

49:26.354 --> 49:27.965
The thing with me as a chef,

49:27.965 --> 49:29.618
whenever I'’ve got to
the highest place of a job,

49:29.618 --> 49:31.011
I'’ve always left.

49:31.011 --> 49:32.882
I put myself back at
the bottom somewhere else.

49:32.882 --> 49:34.841
I think me brother was always
the sporty one

49:34.841 --> 49:36.886
and me sister was
academically clever

49:36.886 --> 49:38.323
and I was just a
little wrong child.

49:38.323 --> 49:39.715
You know what I mean?

49:39.715 --> 49:41.282
So I should be pretty
healthy mentally now,

49:41.282 --> 49:43.502
but that need to prove
myself'’s never left me.

49:43.502 --> 49:45.025
You'’re excellent.
Thank you.

49:45.025 --> 49:46.026
Thanks.

49:46.026 --> 49:47.158
Hello.

49:47.158 --> 49:48.289
Hey, we'’re going
to hit the hot tub.

49:48.289 --> 49:49.421
Perfect.

49:49.421 --> 49:51.249
- When in Rome.
- Hot tub time.

49:51.249 --> 49:52.902
Great.

49:52.902 --> 49:54.730
Hey, Rue.
How are you doing?

49:54.730 --> 49:56.515
<i>Good, yourself?
Can you hear me?</i>

49:56.515 --> 49:58.560
Good.
So what'’s the news?

49:58.560 --> 50:00.388
<i>Sorry about this, Captain.</i>

50:00.388 --> 50:02.216
<i>But I don'’t think I'm going to
get the ticket sorted in time.</i>

50:02.216 --> 50:03.609
<i>I don'’t want to hold
the vessel up any longer.</i>

50:03.609 --> 50:05.176
<i>I'’m just going to go back home</i>

50:05.176 --> 50:06.873
<i>and I don'’t think
I'’m going to come back.</i>

50:06.873 --> 50:08.831
So what about your documents
that were on their way here?

50:08.831 --> 50:10.746
Do we have to mail
them back to you?

50:10.746 --> 50:14.837
<i>No, no, I stopped that because
my friend was going to send it.</i>

50:14.837 --> 50:16.404
- Uh-huh.
<i>- Is far away.</i>

50:16.404 --> 50:18.058
Yeah.

50:18.058 --> 50:21.105
<i>I'’m kind of just deciding
to just call it quits</i>

50:21.105 --> 50:23.324
<i>and just head back
to South Africa.</i>

50:23.324 --> 50:25.587
Yeah.

50:25.587 --> 50:27.546
!
!

50:27.546 --> 50:28.982
<i>I'’m just going to go back home</i>

50:28.982 --> 50:30.375
<i>and sort out what
I need to sort out.</i>

50:30.375 --> 50:32.681
Okay. Well, I appreciate
the honesty.

50:32.681 --> 50:34.596
Okay. Bye-bye.

50:45.825 --> 50:47.435
Hey, who'’s drink is this?

50:47.435 --> 50:48.741
- Mine.
- Oh, sh--.

50:48.741 --> 50:50.351
Who puts ice in...
You want milk, too?

50:50.351 --> 50:51.613
Would everyone like a top off,

50:51.613 --> 50:53.224
or are you guys all
still sipping?

50:53.224 --> 50:54.573
I will do an ice top off.

50:54.573 --> 50:55.748
Ice top off.

51:00.318 --> 51:02.885
You don'’t want
to disturb the client

51:02.885 --> 51:04.670
and let them know that
everything that'’s happening,

51:04.670 --> 51:06.933
because it'’s really an
embarrassment for the boat.

51:06.933 --> 51:08.500
I just have to keep them fed,

51:08.500 --> 51:11.111
fill their drinks,
keep them happy.

51:11.111 --> 51:12.982
Smoke and mirrors,
nothing to see here.

51:12.982 --> 51:14.419
We'’re just down
a couple of people.

51:14.419 --> 51:15.942
I'’m going to reach out to Norma.

51:15.942 --> 51:18.118
I hope she pulls it off.
I hope she pulls it off.

51:18.118 --> 51:21.121
Did you leave Brooke a list
for when she wakes up?

51:21.121 --> 51:23.167
Um, I told her to wake up
turn down laundry,

51:23.167 --> 51:24.733
and then I'’m going to write
her a note, though.

51:24.733 --> 51:26.648
Normally, she has, like,
an early girl checklist.

51:26.648 --> 51:29.477
I do have one, but she'’s going
to get very overwhelmed with it.

51:29.477 --> 51:31.044
So...

51:31.044 --> 51:32.524
I think you'’re going
too easy on her.

51:32.524 --> 51:36.049
Sorry, if I had her doing this,
she'’s going to die.

51:36.049 --> 51:38.965
Excuse me,
we'’re splitting the same tip.

51:38.965 --> 51:40.575
I know.

51:40.575 --> 51:42.055
We all need
to break a sweat.

51:42.055 --> 51:43.665
She'’s from the deck.
She'’s from the deck,

51:43.665 --> 51:45.232
but she'’s, like...
She'’s doing good.

51:45.232 --> 51:47.104
That doesn'’t mean
she'’s not able to do the job.

51:47.104 --> 51:49.018
She took the laundry.
It'’s her first...

51:49.018 --> 51:50.977
Literally her
first day yachting.

51:50.977 --> 51:52.587
Jess needs to chill
the [bleep] out.

51:52.587 --> 51:54.067
Like, it'’s our first night.

51:54.067 --> 51:55.808
Brooke is as green as
Kermit the Frog.

51:55.808 --> 51:57.157
She'’s brand spankin' new
to the interior.

51:57.157 --> 51:58.854
Imagine if there were
only two of us.

51:58.854 --> 52:01.422
A 55-meter boat should
run with four stews.

52:01.422 --> 52:02.771
There'’s four stories.

52:02.771 --> 52:04.382
The rooms are huge.

52:04.382 --> 52:05.905
More pantries.
More dining.

52:05.905 --> 52:07.254
There'’s extra cabins.

52:07.254 --> 52:08.908
She needs to settle
the [bleep] down.

52:08.908 --> 52:10.736
We'’re already one person down
in the interior.

52:10.736 --> 52:12.738
Just relax.
You'’re not the chief stew.

52:12.738 --> 52:14.218
You'’re not the chief stew.

52:14.218 --> 52:15.697
I never have thought
I'’d be able to say that.

52:15.697 --> 52:17.351
Like me having to guide her

52:17.351 --> 52:20.311
while I'’m also trying to
do, like, my duties,

52:20.311 --> 52:21.747
and that'’s the problem.

52:23.705 --> 52:24.837
- Hello.
- Hey.

52:24.837 --> 52:26.099
What time do you go down?

52:26.099 --> 52:27.970
- I was going to go down now.
- Okay.

52:27.970 --> 52:29.189
I just wanted to ask
you a couple of questions.

52:29.189 --> 52:30.930
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- For my watch keeper.

52:30.930 --> 52:33.237
Like, is it, she'’s,
like, just in the bridge?

52:33.237 --> 52:34.107
Nothing else?

52:34.107 --> 52:35.761
So, right now, she can help,

52:35.761 --> 52:37.371
but after people go to bed,
she stays on the bridge.

52:37.371 --> 52:38.677
Okay, cool.

52:38.677 --> 52:39.982
- I'’m ready to go to bed.
- All right, bro.

52:39.982 --> 52:41.767
Thank you.
Good night.

52:41.767 --> 52:42.985
Sweet dreams, everyone.

52:42.985 --> 52:44.465
How about you go
to bed right now?

52:44.465 --> 52:46.075
I'’m going to be waking up
for a little bit longer.

52:46.075 --> 52:47.425
I'’ll just square up
and go to bed.

52:47.425 --> 52:48.948
- Okay.
- Thank you so much.

52:48.948 --> 52:51.646
No, thank you.
You'’re such a great chief stew.

52:51.646 --> 52:53.866
Like, you don'’t stress out,

52:53.866 --> 52:55.346
so thank you for being you.

52:55.346 --> 52:57.043
Thank you, my love.

52:57.043 --> 52:58.175
Ciao, ciao.

52:58.175 --> 52:59.828
We'’re going to turn
off the lights.

52:59.828 --> 53:01.090
What time are you getting up?

53:01.090 --> 53:02.483
How long have you let
everyone sleep?

53:02.483 --> 53:04.224
By the way, you'’re now
the department head.

53:04.224 --> 53:06.792
Eight hours sleep,
but I doubt that this trip.

53:06.792 --> 53:07.967
Are you confident?

53:07.967 --> 53:09.447
I don'’t know what's happening.

53:09.447 --> 53:11.405
You never know
what'’s happening, do you?

53:11.405 --> 53:13.407
I'’ll be up the same
time as you then.

53:13.407 --> 53:14.452
Yeah, I'’ll see you then.

53:14.452 --> 53:16.280
Sweet.

53:16.280 --> 53:18.499
I'’ve been chucked in the deep
end before, but never this deep.

53:18.499 --> 53:21.633
I'’ve never been in a position
where I'’ve had to manage a team.

53:21.633 --> 53:24.636
On this shift, you don'’t have
to sit up here the whole time.

53:24.636 --> 53:26.159
Once everyone'’s gone to bed,

53:26.159 --> 53:28.683
then you got to sit in here
and keep an eye on it.

53:28.683 --> 53:30.250
My biggest worry at the moment

53:30.250 --> 53:32.339
is I don'’t know
what I don'’t know.

53:32.339 --> 53:35.429
I'’ve just fingers crossed,
someone else comes in.

53:35.429 --> 53:37.997
Hoping we get another bosun.

53:41.914 --> 53:43.655
Yeah, and maybe just
check for the teak.

53:43.655 --> 53:44.917
Yeah.

53:44.917 --> 53:46.179
All right,
I'’m going to go to bed.

53:46.179 --> 53:47.702
Okay.

53:47.702 --> 53:49.226
The last thing I want to do
is let Captain Sandy down.

54:07.896 --> 54:10.072
I didn'’t even know
that the bosun had left.

54:10.072 --> 54:11.900
Yeah, we'’re going
to need your help.

54:11.900 --> 54:14.207
I'’d gladly switch over.

54:14.207 --> 54:15.208
Yeah.

54:21.258 --> 54:23.216
You'’re going to smell
the flavor away.

54:23.216 --> 54:24.870
Get away.

54:24.870 --> 54:26.263
Just come and
smell my cheese.

54:40.929 --> 54:42.279
More like a hand massage.

54:43.845 --> 54:45.891
Great, answers.

54:47.806 --> 54:49.677
Hi, Norma.

54:49.677 --> 54:51.897
Maybe put a couple jet skis in.

54:51.897 --> 54:54.726
You'’re kidding me. You can't
get anyone for two weeks?

54:56.380 --> 54:58.686
Now, what do I do?

54:58.686 --> 55:00.340
What do I do?

55:00.340 --> 55:02.516
Unbelievable.
