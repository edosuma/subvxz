WEBVTT

00:12.833 --> 00:14.541
I'm going to the police.

00:14.625 --> 00:16.416
You can't go to the police.

00:16.500 --> 00:17.916
Oga Rambo bribes them.

00:18.000 --> 00:21.166
If they tell him, he'll do something
to Rahila. Please don't go.

00:21.250 --> 00:22.458
Ishaya.

00:23.250 --> 00:25.375
You are just like your father.

00:27.458 --> 00:31.625
See how you're destroying
your sister's life to follow your dream.

00:33.916 --> 00:36.166
Just like your father killed his son,

00:36.791 --> 00:39.041
Dauda, just for the love of art.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.333
Ishaya.

00:44.208 --> 00:46.291
Get out of this house.

00:46.375 --> 00:49.666
And don't return
unless it's with your sister.

00:50.625 --> 00:51.625
Get out!

00:52.208 --> 00:54.083
Mummy, Mummy…

01:41.166 --> 01:42.833
Train her so she can dance tomorrow.

01:42.916 --> 01:44.916
Uncle, please!

01:45.000 --> 01:47.666
Uncle, please, I'm begging you with God.

01:48.625 --> 01:49.458
Ijoba.

01:50.041 --> 01:54.833
We should have killed the boy
and fed him to Angel.

01:56.833 --> 01:58.208
Take her away.

01:58.708 --> 02:00.666
Uncle, please!

02:44.833 --> 02:48.041
Sorry, sir.
I was delayed due to traffic.

02:58.416 --> 02:59.833
Thank you, sir.

03:01.708 --> 03:03.875
Sir, hold on.
This money is not complete.

03:03.958 --> 03:05.416
Is the picture framed?

03:05.500 --> 03:06.416
-Sir--
-Is it?

03:06.500 --> 03:08.583
But this
wasn't the agreement, sir.

03:16.208 --> 03:17.666
<i>Look at this one.</i>

03:17.750 --> 03:19.583
The pool lights
around the pool.

03:20.958 --> 03:22.333
You know what I like?

03:23.125 --> 03:25.125
I liked the way
you played with me all night.

03:25.708 --> 03:27.875
As long as you keep doing that,

03:27.958 --> 03:29.916
-there's nothing I won't buy for you.
-Mmm.

03:30.541 --> 03:31.916
Stay there.

03:33.958 --> 03:35.041
What happened?

03:35.125 --> 03:37.125
Mr. Moscow
says she refuses to dance,

03:37.208 --> 03:39.500
and since Government isn't around,
I brought her to you.

03:39.583 --> 03:41.875
You want me
to teach her how to dance?

03:43.833 --> 03:44.916
Who is this?

03:45.000 --> 03:48.500
She's that thief's sister!

03:48.583 --> 03:51.000
We gave him a job,
but instead he stole from us.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.291
Take her for dance training.

03:53.833 --> 03:55.000
Uh…

03:55.833 --> 03:57.583
Rambo, she's not Rush's standard.

03:57.666 --> 03:59.958
Uh-huh?
She can't dance for Rush.

04:03.125 --> 04:04.541
She looks like a fish.

04:05.166 --> 04:07.708
Keep her in the dungeon for now.

04:07.791 --> 04:10.166
Government
said to train her to dance tonight.

04:10.250 --> 04:11.416
Are you deaf?

04:15.500 --> 04:17.916
Will you get…
Will you stand up?

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Stand up!

04:23.583 --> 04:25.708
I have to go to the salon now.

04:25.791 --> 04:27.000
I have a customer waiting.

04:27.083 --> 04:29.375
Let me marry you,
so I can spoil you with money.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.708
Okay.

04:30.791 --> 04:32.166
I'll think about it.

04:33.208 --> 04:34.166
Adufe.

04:35.333 --> 04:36.541
The boss's heart.

04:38.333 --> 04:39.375
Bad girl.

04:39.458 --> 04:41.791
Michael, I don't know what I will do.

04:43.625 --> 04:44.458
Ishaya.

04:45.083 --> 04:48.000
Do you know that
Rahila is in a stripper's uniform at Rush?

04:48.083 --> 04:49.500
Did your boyfriend not kidnap her?

04:49.583 --> 04:51.250
Didn't you steal from him?

04:53.208 --> 04:55.500
What's the plan?
You have to get her out.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.083
Or Government
will have her on drugs in no time.

04:58.166 --> 04:59.833
<i>We need to diversify.</i>

05:02.708 --> 05:05.958
<i>But this,</i>
<i>this will attract rich young people.</i>

05:06.541 --> 05:07.583
Don't be a snitch.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.833
<i>That's the only way</i>
<i>we can compete today.</i>

05:09.916 --> 05:12.750
Selling art in the streets
is not gonna work.

05:13.250 --> 05:14.625
I'll get another plan.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.166
But

05:18.208 --> 05:20.916
I need you to get me
a meeting with Government.

05:22.458 --> 05:24.916
Adufe, please. I beg you.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.250
Okay.

05:31.333 --> 05:33.333
Come to the club before closing.

06:02.250 --> 06:04.666
-Did anyone touch you?

06:04.750 --> 06:07.291
Ishaya will get you out of here. Just eat.

06:07.375 --> 06:09.666
-Don't leave me!
-He's coming soon, don't worry.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.625
Baido, please don't tell anyone
you saw me here.

06:24.875 --> 06:26.541
I swear I'll pay you back.

06:40.458 --> 06:43.125
See, those rich children in Wilmer,

06:43.208 --> 06:46.041
they will buy your molly
because I can sell it to them.

06:48.250 --> 06:50.000
See, I go there now, see…

06:51.833 --> 06:52.958
See their uniform?

06:55.875 --> 06:56.875
Baido.

06:57.541 --> 06:58.875
Feed him to Angel.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.083
-No, wait, please!
-Stop.

07:05.916 --> 07:07.083
Say more.

07:07.708 --> 07:08.708
Thank you, sir.

07:09.375 --> 07:12.125
I was in the toilets this morning,
and I saw some children,

07:12.208 --> 07:14.750
they were smoking some type of weed
that I've never smelled before.

07:14.833 --> 07:17.625
Mr. Government, these children,
they have money.

07:18.125 --> 07:20.125
They like expensive things,
they like new things.

07:20.208 --> 07:22.500
Please give me some molly,
let me sell it to them.

07:22.583 --> 07:24.708
I promise, I swear to God, it will work.

07:26.041 --> 07:27.791
Have you sold before?

07:28.750 --> 07:30.041
Answer me, have you?

07:32.791 --> 07:34.791
Ijoba, are you falling for this?

07:36.500 --> 07:39.333
Uh, those kids,
they spend millions to party,

07:39.416 --> 07:42.000
and if he goes to the school,
they can trust him and buy--

07:42.083 --> 07:44.541
Shut your mouth.
Don't do that again.

07:45.166 --> 07:46.291
Sit down.

07:48.875 --> 07:50.666
I'll give you
my molly to sell.

07:52.708 --> 07:54.500
But if there's any mistake,

07:55.000 --> 07:56.083
I'll kill him myself.

07:56.166 --> 07:57.208
No.

08:05.041 --> 08:06.541
Angel will kill him.

08:08.000 --> 08:09.166
That's her job.

08:28.375 --> 08:30.791
500,000 naira
worth of Molly.

08:30.875 --> 08:32.208
Sell it in a week.

08:32.291 --> 08:33.166
Sir?

08:33.750 --> 08:35.500
This is more than what I owe you, sir.

08:35.583 --> 08:38.833
Since you can't pay me what you owe me,
I own your life.

08:41.000 --> 08:42.208
Give him his sister.

08:50.375 --> 08:53.333
My number one rule
is to never get high on my supply.

09:34.041 --> 09:34.958
Rahila.

09:36.916 --> 09:38.125
Rahila.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.916
My baby.

09:41.625 --> 09:43.875
My baby. Aw.

09:45.125 --> 09:46.750
You can't come in.

09:54.125 --> 09:55.833
So glad you're back.

09:56.416 --> 10:00.041
Ah, I missed my baby.
I missed my baby so much.

10:22.625 --> 10:24.375
That makes no sense.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.583
Why did you tell Government
you could sell this at Wilmer?

10:27.666 --> 10:28.875
What should I have said?

10:28.958 --> 10:30.708
I don't know, but not this.

10:30.791 --> 10:34.250
Do you even have the balls
to sell drugs for Government?

10:36.833 --> 10:38.166
I don't have a choice.

10:51.250 --> 10:53.666
Ishaya,
you've come to visit me!

10:53.750 --> 10:56.125
Uh, actually, we're roommates.

10:56.791 --> 10:59.875
I thought I was going to be alone.
No one showed up yesterday.

10:59.958 --> 11:01.375
Whoa, okay.

11:12.500 --> 11:13.750
You should take a picture.

11:15.458 --> 11:16.625
It will last longer.

11:19.625 --> 11:20.916
I'm here to see Ms. Irurhe.

11:21.000 --> 11:24.125
I just wanted to ask her
about the London art competition thing.

11:24.208 --> 11:25.333
How about you?

11:25.416 --> 11:28.500
-Planning Founder's Day ball.
-Which one is that one?

11:28.583 --> 11:31.666
An event where parents dress formal,
drink champagne,

11:31.750 --> 11:33.666
in the name of our founding father.

11:34.250 --> 11:36.125
I can introduce you to a few millionaires

11:36.208 --> 11:38.458
if you join the planning committee.

11:38.541 --> 11:39.708
Okay.

11:41.166 --> 11:42.208
I'll join.

11:46.083 --> 11:47.125
Sorry about that.

11:49.083 --> 11:50.541
Uh, where are you going?

11:50.625 --> 11:53.000
Ishaya offered to take my place
on the planning committee.

11:55.666 --> 11:56.500
Have fun.

11:58.250 --> 12:02.208
Okay, Ishaya.
Um, let's get started after lunch.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.291
Why didn't you get this thing?

12:23.375 --> 12:25.708
It's a shrimp wrap.
I'm allergic to seafood.

12:26.208 --> 12:27.083
Shrimp wrap.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.458
Food's good, right?

12:34.541 --> 12:36.125
It's good. It's actually good.

12:36.208 --> 12:39.541
-Ishaya, are you on Blink?
-Yeah.

12:44.625 --> 12:46.500
Party this weekend. You ready?

12:47.375 --> 12:49.541
-Those guys, are they on Blink too?
-Yeah.

12:49.625 --> 12:51.083
Coke go choke.

12:53.000 --> 12:54.000
Take a look.

12:56.583 --> 12:59.000
Wow, who's this Reggie guy?

12:59.875 --> 13:03.000
Captain of the football team,
son of Senator Flag-Kukrubo.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.666
-And a tall glass of hot chocolate.
-Okay.

13:05.750 --> 13:07.958
I heard he's having a party
at his house this weekend.

13:08.541 --> 13:11.041
-But you have to be invited.
-How do I get invited?

13:11.125 --> 13:13.083
Be cool
or be a member of the football team.

13:13.166 --> 13:14.291
Tryouts are tomorrow.

13:14.833 --> 13:15.708
Tryouts?

13:15.791 --> 13:17.541
Guy, download the school app.

13:36.541 --> 13:40.458
I see some of you new boys
looking at me and thinking to yourselves,

13:40.541 --> 13:45.583
"Isn't this the Okeke Tony
who used to play for the Super Eagles?"

13:47.833 --> 13:50.750
Well, I can tell you for free
that, yes, I am he.

13:50.833 --> 13:52.875
Mmm-hmm.

13:54.166 --> 13:55.291
Mmm-hmm.

13:57.166 --> 13:58.375
Mmm-mmm.

13:58.958 --> 14:02.166
You can't play without boots,
shin pads, and hoses.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.458
Go to the lost and found
and get something.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.583
Let's play ball!

14:22.291 --> 14:24.833
If you do not jump for the ball,
you cannot get the header!

14:30.500 --> 14:32.708
-All right, let's play ball!

14:38.791 --> 14:39.625
Pass!

14:40.708 --> 14:41.791
Pass the ball!

14:41.875 --> 14:44.000
Pass! Pass!

14:46.583 --> 14:47.791
Shoot! Shoot!

14:49.583 --> 14:50.750
Yes!

14:53.166 --> 14:55.416
New boy! Welcome to the team, new boy!

14:55.500 --> 14:58.416
Reggie, give him a warm welcome.

14:58.500 --> 14:59.916
-Baller.
-Hey.

15:00.000 --> 15:01.250
-Nice one, bro.
-Thanks, man.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.708
Hey, we're about to head over
to the cheerleading tryouts.

15:03.791 --> 15:04.916
-Wanna come?
-Sure.

15:05.000 --> 15:06.125
-All right.
-All right.

15:22.583 --> 15:23.875
You're in.

15:24.458 --> 15:25.333
Next.

15:26.333 --> 15:27.250
Zina.

15:28.833 --> 15:30.125
Bro, that's my friend.

15:30.666 --> 15:32.291
Go, Zina! Go, Zina!

15:32.875 --> 15:34.541
Hey, here's your uniform.

15:35.041 --> 15:36.208
Let me see that.

15:43.166 --> 15:46.750
Nen, you know this is a cheer squad,
not a choir, right?

15:47.375 --> 15:49.166
My mum wants us to look decent.

15:50.208 --> 15:52.500
Start, please.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.708
Go, Zina.

16:08.125 --> 16:09.500
That's my friend.

16:10.875 --> 16:13.625
-Oh, yeah!

16:27.708 --> 16:29.416
This is not a music video audition.

16:29.500 --> 16:31.250
But she was amazing!

16:31.333 --> 16:34.833
She's clearly not cheer squad material.
She'll be a distraction.

16:34.916 --> 16:37.916
Which we'll need when
we wear these nun's uniforms.

16:38.791 --> 16:40.291
Zina! Zina!

16:40.375 --> 16:44.125
-Zina! Zina! Zina!

16:44.208 --> 16:45.291
Okay, fine!

16:46.250 --> 16:47.083
She's in.

16:47.166 --> 16:48.291
-Yes!
-Yes!

16:51.458 --> 16:54.166
Hey, I'm having a party
at mine this weekend.

16:54.250 --> 16:55.416
Bring your friend.

16:57.458 --> 16:59.583
Carmen, you're up next.

17:00.750 --> 17:01.750
What?

17:02.875 --> 17:05.416
-You're next.
-I was cheer squad captain last year.

17:05.500 --> 17:07.041
Well, I'm cheer squad captain now.

17:07.958 --> 17:08.791
Okay?

17:15.041 --> 17:17.250
Guess who got
invited to Reggie's party?

17:17.333 --> 17:20.000
Please make videos so I get
to live vicariously through you guys.

17:20.083 --> 17:22.125
-Which one is vicariously?

17:22.208 --> 17:23.916
-What am I going to wear?
-Hey.

17:24.416 --> 17:27.458
See, dude, I don't have
any time for your problems right now.

17:27.541 --> 17:28.541
Please.

17:29.708 --> 17:32.041
-You want me to tell them--
-Tell them what?

17:34.416 --> 17:37.750
See, guys, just go ahead,
I'll catch up with you later, okay?

17:43.083 --> 17:44.083
Yes?

17:44.833 --> 17:46.958
I want to follow you
to Reggie's party.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.333
"I want to follow you to Reggie's party."

17:49.875 --> 17:52.000
Am I your dad?
Go away, please.

18:01.833 --> 18:04.000
How will you
sell it at the party?

18:04.500 --> 18:08.250
I don't know. I'll give it to Reggie
to sell to his friends.

18:21.458 --> 18:22.458
Rahila.

18:32.583 --> 18:35.500
-You decided to steal my dream from me?
-It wasn't like that.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.208
He's only there
so he can save you from Oga Rambo.

18:38.291 --> 18:41.250
Whose fault was it
that I got kidnapped in the first place?

18:42.375 --> 18:45.750
You're always so selfish.
How could you do this to me?

19:09.666 --> 19:12.083
Carmen? Nnenna's here!

19:13.833 --> 19:17.041
I'm only allowing her to go to this party
because of you.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.750
I trust your judgement to keep her safe.

19:26.000 --> 19:28.291
I hope you're not here
to ask me to repeat tryouts.

19:28.375 --> 19:31.833
And I hope you realize
that I am cheer captain, not you.

19:31.916 --> 19:32.833
I was only helping.

19:32.916 --> 19:35.083
If making me look weak as fuck
is you helping,

19:35.166 --> 19:36.791
just keep that shit to yourself.

19:36.875 --> 19:39.500
Well, now I know what I have to do
to get you to come over,

19:39.583 --> 19:42.083
and it's not
getting into a life-threatening accident.

19:42.166 --> 19:44.291
You weren't there when I needed you.

19:48.333 --> 19:50.083
I didn't mean
not to come over and see you.

19:50.166 --> 19:51.083
It's just

19:51.750 --> 19:54.041
school, and church, and…

19:58.375 --> 19:59.500
There's no excuse.

20:00.541 --> 20:01.958
I've been a total bitch.

20:03.125 --> 20:05.083
I should have come over and see you.

20:06.041 --> 20:07.666
I'm so sorry.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.958
I didn't mean to disrespect you
as cheer captain.

20:15.500 --> 20:16.958
Come here.

20:18.208 --> 20:19.333
I missed you.

20:19.416 --> 20:22.416
Thank God you're here,
because I have nothing to wear.

20:22.500 --> 20:25.958
Don't tell me you're going to
the pool party dressed like your mother.

20:28.625 --> 20:30.041
Easy for you to say.

20:30.125 --> 20:31.958
Your leg doesn't look like this.

20:32.791 --> 20:35.583
I can't get plastic surgery
until the plates are out.

20:37.833 --> 20:39.500
You know what? Fuck the scar.

20:40.250 --> 20:41.125
Wear a bikini.

20:41.208 --> 20:45.333
No one will notice when
they're looking at, you know, all of this.

20:45.416 --> 20:47.291
-You know you have it.
-Nen, stop. No.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.208
Come on, let's get you something to wear.

20:49.291 --> 20:50.666
Stop being…

21:10.750 --> 21:12.708
All right, people.

21:12.791 --> 21:15.791
I'd like us to give a big welcome back to…

21:15.875 --> 21:18.708
-Carmen!

21:31.750 --> 21:32.750
Babe.

21:33.750 --> 21:35.166
How was the lawyer's?

21:36.166 --> 21:37.166
It was great.

21:38.041 --> 21:39.958
He didn't think I was his?

21:40.041 --> 21:43.583
Did my father
tell you he didn't think I was his son?

21:50.125 --> 21:51.958
Atlas, thank God you're here.

21:52.041 --> 21:55.041
She won't take off her scarf,
or swim, or dance.

21:55.125 --> 21:57.500
Maybe you can loosen her up.
I need to have some fun.

21:57.583 --> 21:58.708
Bye.

21:58.791 --> 22:00.708
-Yo, Ishaya.
-Hey.

22:00.791 --> 22:02.333
-How's it?
-It's popping, man.

22:02.416 --> 22:05.500
-Aren't you gonna introduce us?
-I think we know each other's names.

22:05.583 --> 22:06.833
I mean, what I don't know

22:06.916 --> 22:09.500
is how long it's gonna take you
to have those shorts off.

22:09.583 --> 22:11.375
Okay! Ha!

22:13.833 --> 22:15.208
Cheers!

22:17.333 --> 22:18.333
Babe…

22:19.166 --> 22:20.791
I think this party's a bad idea.

22:20.875 --> 22:22.375
-I'm not comfortable.

22:22.458 --> 22:25.250
-My scar--
-Again with this, your scar talk!

22:25.333 --> 22:26.166
Excuse me?

22:26.250 --> 22:28.375
Carmen, I don't have
time for this shit today, okay?

22:36.541 --> 22:38.458
What do you mean, "sold out"?

22:39.041 --> 22:40.500
I promised people molly.

22:40.583 --> 22:43.541
What if you
get caught by the police? It's a crime.

22:44.875 --> 22:46.875
Please think of a better way.

22:47.875 --> 22:49.083
Better way?

22:49.916 --> 22:51.375
What better way?

22:58.666 --> 23:00.041
Ugh, fuck off.

23:00.833 --> 23:02.083
Dude, dude, uh…

23:04.208 --> 23:06.541
See this? This is top-grade shit.

23:06.625 --> 23:07.666
Ten K per pill.

23:08.250 --> 23:09.291
Let me see.

23:10.000 --> 23:12.500
Bro, how do I know
you didn't cook this in a kitchen?

23:12.583 --> 23:13.666
Are you buying or not?

23:15.958 --> 23:16.791
All right.

23:17.541 --> 23:18.541
Pop one.

23:18.625 --> 23:20.083
Pop, why?

23:20.166 --> 23:22.250
If it's as good as you say,
I'll buy.

23:22.333 --> 23:24.291
-This…
-Hey, it's cool.

23:25.000 --> 23:27.375
Wait.
Whoa, whoa. Chill, chill. Um…

23:28.791 --> 23:29.750
I'll pop it.

23:36.125 --> 23:37.125
See you in an hour.

24:27.000 --> 24:29.083
Mmm! Okay!

24:29.166 --> 24:31.458
-Is it good?
-To be honest, this is good.

24:31.541 --> 24:33.208
Magic hands, what can I say?

24:33.291 --> 24:34.583
Is that what they do?

24:35.333 --> 24:37.541
You have no idea
what these hands do, babe.

24:38.208 --> 24:40.333
What, like…

24:41.083 --> 24:42.791
beat up people for me?

24:42.875 --> 24:44.000
If you need me to.

24:44.083 --> 24:46.083
Oh, my days, you're so cheesy.

24:52.250 --> 24:53.083
Ah!

25:04.833 --> 25:06.416
I'll take some of that, bro.

25:06.916 --> 25:08.166
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:08.250 --> 25:09.666
Okay.

25:11.125 --> 25:12.333
Yeah.

25:12.833 --> 25:14.958
-I'll sort you out later?
-Water.

25:15.500 --> 25:16.500
Kitchen.

25:17.125 --> 25:19.750
Down the hallway, to the right.

25:26.708 --> 25:27.833
Ijoba.

25:28.375 --> 25:30.750
<i>It's the end of the week.</i>
<i>Where are you?</i>

25:30.833 --> 25:33.250
I'm at a party.
Do you want to come around?

25:33.333 --> 25:35.041
I will send the address to you.

25:50.833 --> 25:52.000
Hey.

25:52.708 --> 25:53.625
Mmm!

25:54.625 --> 25:55.583
Why?

25:55.666 --> 25:58.583
You asked to take the picture
of the most beautiful girl in school.

25:59.208 --> 26:00.375
Hmm?

26:00.458 --> 26:01.708
Okay.

26:01.791 --> 26:03.416
Okay. Okay.

26:03.500 --> 26:04.875
Hey!

26:06.375 --> 26:08.041
-Oh, what's that?

26:09.291 --> 26:10.583
Why are you hiding it?

26:12.291 --> 26:15.208
Shh. I want to show you something.

26:16.458 --> 26:17.708
What are you doing?

26:19.041 --> 26:19.958
See this?

26:21.375 --> 26:24.250
It's from when I stole oranges
from my neighbors.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.500
This…

26:28.500 --> 26:30.708
I broke my principal's windscreen.

26:32.250 --> 26:33.666
They flogged me.

26:40.291 --> 26:42.583
-Oh…

26:44.583 --> 26:46.083
Car accident.

26:46.958 --> 26:48.000
I was driving.

26:53.041 --> 26:55.416
Scars reflect
who you are as a person.

26:57.000 --> 26:58.416
You shouldn't hide it.

27:00.625 --> 27:02.250
Here, let me show you this.

27:02.333 --> 27:04.041
See this one? Come feel it.

27:08.083 --> 27:09.166
You can't see it,

27:09.666 --> 27:10.791
just feel it.

27:14.250 --> 27:17.041
-I need to go find my boyfriend.

27:24.208 --> 27:25.625
Pizza!

27:34.541 --> 27:35.958
I've missed this.

27:46.666 --> 27:47.708
Frank.

27:48.958 --> 27:50.500
Take a look at the house.

27:53.500 --> 27:55.625
Living vicariously, you said?

27:59.458 --> 28:00.458
Oh!

28:00.541 --> 28:02.416
-What the…
-Shit!

28:02.500 --> 28:04.166
Shit, shit, shit!

28:05.583 --> 28:06.666
Enjoy.

28:08.625 --> 28:10.916
-Why didn't you lock the door?
-I thought you did.

28:14.250 --> 28:16.416
-Was he recording?
-I don't know!

28:16.500 --> 28:18.458
Go after him, what are you doing?

28:48.791 --> 28:50.583
Where are we
going this year?

28:50.666 --> 28:52.291
-France.

28:53.583 --> 28:55.625
-Auntie!
-Oh!

28:55.708 --> 28:57.541
-Mmm!
-Darling!

29:00.125 --> 29:01.250
Mama!

29:01.833 --> 29:03.416
Mama, hug.

29:03.916 --> 29:05.458
-Stop.

29:05.541 --> 29:08.083
-Mama, give me a hug!
-Stop. Stop it.

29:09.458 --> 29:10.833
Auntie!

29:11.333 --> 29:13.750
-Auntie, I missed you!
-I can explain, Auntie.

29:13.833 --> 29:16.041
Uh, when I found… Carmen.

29:17.166 --> 29:18.375
She disappeared.

29:18.458 --> 29:21.000
And by the time we found her,
she was drunk.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.000
Leave me.

29:23.083 --> 29:24.916
You will not fail to embarrass me.

29:25.000 --> 29:27.125
I guess I should be grateful
you didn't drive.

29:27.208 --> 29:29.583
Mum,
enough with this accident talk!

29:29.666 --> 29:31.666
It wasn't even my fault. I wasn't the one…

29:33.000 --> 29:34.416
-I'm really sorry, Auntie.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.041
Carmen, upstairs.

29:36.125 --> 29:38.750
I love you, Mama.

29:38.833 --> 29:39.958
Atlas, leave me alone!

29:41.583 --> 29:42.708
Sorry.

29:46.291 --> 29:49.750
That's more drunk
than I've ever been in my life.

29:49.833 --> 29:51.625
Children!

30:06.333 --> 30:10.916
Jesus. I'm in trouble.

30:11.000 --> 30:13.208
Jesus.

30:13.291 --> 30:16.916
My number one rule
is to never get high on my supply.

30:17.916 --> 30:20.041
-Brother Government.
-Where are my pills?

30:23.166 --> 30:24.250
I'm dead!

30:24.333 --> 30:26.916
-It's with Reggie…
-Where's my money?

30:27.000 --> 30:29.208
That's what I'm saying,
just let me call…

30:29.291 --> 30:30.375
Hey!

30:31.750 --> 30:33.333
My Angel will eat your head first.

30:33.416 --> 30:34.625
God save me.

30:34.708 --> 30:37.250
Brother Government, Brother Government,
Brother Government!

30:38.250 --> 30:39.875
Angel, your food is here.

30:39.958 --> 30:41.625
Please think of a better way!

30:41.708 --> 30:43.041
Please, please!

30:43.125 --> 30:45.708
I'm not Government.
I don't forgive.

30:46.416 --> 30:47.666
Do you understand?
