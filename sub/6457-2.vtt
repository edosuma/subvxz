Pippa: Would anyone like
another coffee? Tom: Go on, then.

00:35.400 --> 00:36.680
- Pippa: Great.
- Tom: Thank you.

00:36.760 --> 00:38.520
This is decent stuff. I
brought it from home.

00:38.680 --> 00:41.256
- It's not one of these rip-off-uccinos from bonjour.
- [Both laugh]

00:41.280 --> 00:42.960
Anyone want a top-up? Den?

00:43.120 --> 00:44.936
-No, thanks. I'm off coffee. I'm...
-In. I'll just...

00:44.960 --> 00:46.120
All-righty, there you go.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.320
So, I mean, as I
was saying, the...

00:48.480 --> 00:50.720
Yeah, with imed healthcare
management solutions,

00:50.880 --> 00:53.120
undertaking the
creation of a database

00:53.280 --> 00:56.360
to link clinical commissioning
with a hospital provider

00:56.520 --> 00:59.040
in preparation for 2013,

00:59.200 --> 01:01.600
I think, you know,
we're all set.

01:01.760 --> 01:06.080
Are you still, undertaking your skills mix
review for the trust, though, mr loftus?

01:06.240 --> 01:07.840
On Tuesdays and Thursdays, yes.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.040
Ah, right, and so that won't
affect patient pathways?

01:11.200 --> 01:12.720
I'm not bothered
about patients, pippa.

01:12.880 --> 01:15.600
My client, in this instance dr kersley...
- Mmm-hmm.

01:15.760 --> 01:19.640
Is committed to providing
best value, significant savings,

01:19.800 --> 01:23.880
and also supply, um, chain
expertise to the healthcare sector.

01:24.040 --> 01:26.480
- Absolutely.
- Well, we're an excellent provider, Tom.

01:26.640 --> 01:29.520
If you're delivering
excellence at the right price,

01:29.680 --> 01:32.320
then we're interested in
procurement solutions.

01:32.480 --> 01:37.320
Dr kersley is looking at 500
hips, and that's just for a kick-off.

01:50.800 --> 01:54.240
Are we absolutely happy that
there is no conflict of interest

01:54.400 --> 01:59.440
in us recommending that dr Moore
sit on the new gp commissioning group

01:59.600 --> 02:02.760
at the same time
as st Jude's tenders

02:02.920 --> 02:06.080
for 500 hips, 600 knees?

02:06.240 --> 02:10.000
You know, from a primary care
pov, we are fully compliant, so...

02:10.160 --> 02:11.880
Yes, yes, well, as
I've said, you know,

02:12.040 --> 02:13.416
I have very, very little to do
with the surgical team, you know.

02:13.440 --> 02:16.160
- Right.
- My vag-at research

02:16.320 --> 02:21.520
is bacterial migration via the motion of
solids, fluids, semen, discharges, seepage...

02:21.680 --> 02:25.120
- Okay.
- If you like, and indeed, gas along the perineum,

02:25.280 --> 02:29.320
and ultimately colonising the
entire atrophic undercarriage.

02:29.480 --> 02:31.840
So, you know, it's absolutely
a million miles away from hips,

02:32.000 --> 02:34.880
although not anatomically,
of course, so...

02:35.040 --> 02:38.440
So, you're looking very much at a
sort of intermixture of departments here?

02:38.600 --> 02:43.080
Oh, yeah, absolutely. You've
got vagina, urethra, anus.

02:43.240 --> 02:44.976
You know, these guys don't
normally talk to each other.

02:45.000 --> 02:47.360
- So I'm talking about bringing the whole...
- [Cup clinking]

02:47.480 --> 02:50.680
- Oh, lord, Tom, I'm so sorry. Gosh.
- Don't worry. Don't, don't.

02:50.840 --> 02:52.976
-Pippa: Your suit. Let me just... oh.
-Tom: No. Ooh, er...

02:53.000 --> 02:55.080
-Pippa: Just awful. I'm so sorry.
-Tom: Don't worry.

02:55.240 --> 02:57.176
- Tom: Is there a toilet or...
- It's second on the left.

02:57.200 --> 02:59.056
-So sorry, Tommy.
-Thank you. Do you want to carry on?

02:59.080 --> 03:02.400
Yes, actually, I think we've
covered everything, haven't we?

03:02.560 --> 03:04.640
I, er... I think so.

03:04.800 --> 03:07.216
I actually wouldn't mind getting off,
because I don't like to leave the practice...

03:07.240 --> 03:09.256
- Yes, of course. Absolutely.
- Unmanaged during patient hours.

03:09.280 --> 03:13.160
Tania, can I just add my taxi
receipt from this morning, please...

03:13.320 --> 03:15.720
- Tania: Yeah, absolutely.
- To my monthly expenses cheque?

03:15.880 --> 03:17.656
Tania: And your meal
allowance. Just get that to me.

03:17.680 --> 03:19.880
- That's great, thanks.
- Did you get a taxi to work?

03:20.040 --> 03:22.040
Oh, gosh, Tom, am I forgiven?

03:22.200 --> 03:24.280
- Absolutely not.
- [Both laughing]

03:24.440 --> 03:26.336
-So sorry. Gosh! Awful.
-No, of course. Of course you are.

03:26.360 --> 03:27.920
Please don't worry, don't worry.

03:28.080 --> 03:30.680
- So, I think we're done?
- Yes, we're... everything.

03:30.840 --> 03:33.216
- Listen, um, it's terrific to see you, pippa.
- Thank you so much. Yes.

03:33.240 --> 03:35.360
I will crack on with
that recommendation.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.400
-Fabulous. Thank you so much, Tom.
-Great.

03:37.560 --> 03:39.960
- Hilary, um, thanks for everything.
- Thanks.

03:40.120 --> 03:42.960
Good. All right, I'll
grab that. Whoops!

03:51.160 --> 03:52.960
Is it mine?

03:53.120 --> 03:54.400
No, I'm just
taking this for Kim.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.400
Look, there's loads
here, hilary. Help yourself.

03:56.440 --> 03:59.200
No, no, not the
croissants. The baby.

03:59.360 --> 04:00.840
Hils, I really don't
think it can be.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.840
But dr Moore said there
could be significant seepage

04:04.000 --> 04:06.440
from the back bottom
to the front bottom.

04:06.600 --> 04:08.880
Listen, I don't even know
if I'm going to keep it.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.840
Honestly, don't
hold your breath.

04:12.880 --> 04:14.240
[Door closing]

04:14.400 --> 04:15.800
[Phone ringing]

04:22.200 --> 04:24.400
Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I was an sen.

04:25.600 --> 04:27.640
S-e-n.

04:27.800 --> 04:32.320
Yeah, it's... It's what you
did if you'd only got cses.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.280
But, you know, I have
got 15 years' experience.

04:35.840 --> 04:37.360
50 modules?

04:38.640 --> 04:41.160
Then I can go to medical school?

04:41.320 --> 04:44.240
Oh, hang on. Sorry, I'll...
I'll have to call you back.

04:44.400 --> 04:47.280
Doris, please do not
get out of bed, okay?

04:47.440 --> 04:50.200
There's a care assistant
coming later today.

04:50.360 --> 04:53.080
Hey! Hey, are you from estates?

04:53.240 --> 04:55.480
Come on, back
into bed. In you go.

04:55.640 --> 04:56.800
Hey!

04:57.320 --> 04:59.760
Come back!

04:59.920 --> 05:01.840
Ooh, Kim, I've got you
some free croissants.

05:02.000 --> 05:04.440
- Someone just came out of that room.
- What room?

05:04.600 --> 05:06.320
Well, the one that
you think is your office.

05:06.400 --> 05:08.240
- No.
- [Thudding]

05:10.600 --> 05:12.040
God!

05:12.200 --> 05:14.360
Was he... did he look
like he was from estates?

05:14.520 --> 05:15.696
- He just looked like a bloke.
- [Phone ringing]

05:15.720 --> 05:18.280
- You do need to be a bit more observant, Kim.
- Sorry.

05:18.440 --> 05:20.040
Oh, Kim, please
don't take that call.

05:20.200 --> 05:22.056
- I need to prepare for ward round.
- I've got to.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.560
Oh, hi. Ques a bwengu.

05:24.720 --> 05:28.000
No, well, it's because the knob on the
toaster's probably been turned down.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.480
Put it back up to six, okay?

05:30.640 --> 05:34.280
-Okay, got the bread in? Yeah, that's right.
-[Whirring]

05:34.440 --> 05:36.040
Yeah, and if you smell burning,

05:36.200 --> 05:38.680
just press that button on the
left-hand side, the blue one.

05:38.840 --> 05:40.960
All right. Yeah,
I'll see you later.

05:41.120 --> 05:44.360
You would be a lot better, Kim,
sorting out the patients' toasts here,

05:44.520 --> 05:46.520
rather than sorting out
toast for your lodger.

05:46.680 --> 05:48.880
Has the dementia
care assistant arrived?

05:49.040 --> 05:52.040
-[Whirring] -Doris!
That's... Don't do that. Doris!

05:52.200 --> 05:53.360
I take that as a "no."

05:53.520 --> 05:55.320
You'll have some
sort of terrible accident.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.760
- Good morning, sister.
- Oh! Yes.

05:57.920 --> 05:59.656
- How are you today?
- Fine, Damaris, yes, um...

05:59.680 --> 06:02.120
- Well, I'm a bit tired, actually.
- Of course.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.456
I wondered if you could make
a window for me this morning.

06:04.480 --> 06:06.400
- Sorry?
- Would 8:40 suit?

06:06.560 --> 06:08.760
- Yeah, that's fine, yeah.
- Great. My office, then?

06:08.920 --> 06:11.560
- Yeah. Lovely.
- Great. Okay, well, I'll see you 8:40.

06:11.720 --> 06:12.720
8:40. Lovely.

06:12.800 --> 06:13.800
- Hi, Kim.
- Hi.

06:13.920 --> 06:14.680
- Bye, Kim.
- Bye.

06:14.840 --> 06:16.400
Den: Bye.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.840
What did little miss
bachelor of sciences want?

06:19.000 --> 06:22.440
Oh, I don't know. I don't really
care. Handing in my notice anyway.

06:22.600 --> 06:24.520
- [Keys clacking]
- [Bed whirring]

06:33.600 --> 06:35.840
You're going to have to
keep an eye on Doris, Kim.

06:36.000 --> 06:39.200
Well, they haven't exactly
made it easy for us, have they?

06:39.360 --> 06:41.240
Well, you've got
that mirror up there.

06:41.400 --> 06:43.280
You can just look at
her through the mirror.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.680
I mean, I can't really tell even
which room she's in from here.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.160
- I don't think it is.
- No, it's that side, isn't it?

06:49.320 --> 06:51.320
It doesn't twist the whole
thing round, does it?

06:51.480 --> 06:53.176
Well, that's what they
do normally, isn't it?

06:53.200 --> 06:56.720
-It's what seems...
-Do you know what? It would be a lot easier.

06:56.880 --> 06:58.480
- What?
- This.

06:58.640 --> 07:00.560
- What, if we move the nurses'...
- Ah-ha!

07:00.720 --> 07:02.336
Yeah, they should have
the nurses' desk like this,

07:02.360 --> 07:05.000
but that's the data
protection thing, isn't it, now?

07:05.160 --> 07:08.440
- In what way?
- Because if we're sitting like this

07:08.600 --> 07:10.176
in a nurses' station
like it used to be...

07:10.200 --> 07:12.200
- It's much better, though, isn't it?
- Yes, well...

07:12.360 --> 07:14.416
- We haven't got a desk now so there's no work to do.
- Lovely.

07:14.440 --> 07:16.880
- That is better.
- [Both laughing]

07:19.040 --> 07:21.520
Now, I've just been
informed by patient experience

07:21.680 --> 07:23.840
that a Dani is going to be
taking place any day now.

07:24.000 --> 07:27.440
Oh, right. Yeah, okay, well,
look, my ward's always ready, so...

07:27.600 --> 07:30.720
Yes, er, but let's just keep an
extra eye on quality of provision.

07:30.880 --> 07:32.120
- Yeah.
- Brilliant.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.016
Fine, I'll look out for
anyone in a suit, yeah.

07:34.040 --> 07:36.296
Well, any clothes, actually, 'cause
they tend to dress down these days.

07:36.320 --> 07:39.760
Oh, right. Okay. I'll look out
for anyone in any clothes at all.

07:40.640 --> 07:41.800
So...

07:45.760 --> 07:47.760
Thanks.

07:47.920 --> 07:50.256
No, I appreciate that you wanted
to keep your condition confidential

07:50.280 --> 07:53.320
until your 12-week scan, but I'm
really glad that you e-mailed me, sister.

07:53.480 --> 07:56.880
Oh, well, um, actually... Um...

07:59.920 --> 08:02.280
I'm feeling a bit thrown by it.

08:02.440 --> 08:07.880
Well, I mean, in order to maximise
your effectiveness during your pregnancy,

08:08.040 --> 08:09.400
you become my responsibility.

08:09.560 --> 08:11.640
Yeah, well, not necessarily,
because I might just...

08:11.800 --> 08:14.600
So, the first thing I need to do
is evaluate your entitlements.

08:15.840 --> 08:17.080
- Entitlements?
- Yes.

08:17.240 --> 08:19.080
You're entitled to 52
weeks' maternity leave,

08:19.240 --> 08:21.960
26 weeks' ordinary,
and 26 weeks' additional,

08:22.120 --> 08:23.896
and you have a range of
rights during this period,

08:23.920 --> 08:25.840
including flexible
working arrangements,

08:26.000 --> 08:28.920
should you wish to return to
work at the end of your leave.

08:29.080 --> 08:32.520
- Oh.
- You may be entitled to paid time off for antenatal care,

08:32.680 --> 08:37.040
and you are also protected
from unfair treatment.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.960
Oh, that's really nice, 'cause
actually I do feel very vulnerable.

08:40.120 --> 08:43.960
Mmm. Well, I'm going to conduct a
specific risk assessment for your needs,

08:44.120 --> 08:47.400
and you're entitled to a free fridge
for your expressed breast milk.

08:47.560 --> 08:49.000
Mmm.

08:49.160 --> 08:51.200
- Is that all clear?
- Lovely.

08:51.360 --> 08:53.920
Anything else I can answer
any questions on, or...

08:54.080 --> 08:56.200
I don't think so, just, um...

08:57.240 --> 08:59.000
Just...

08:59.160 --> 09:00.920
Could it be a fridge freezer?

09:03.280 --> 09:05.880
[Whispering] The
benefits are amazing!

09:06.680 --> 09:08.240
Oh!

09:08.400 --> 09:10.920
Mmm, I do deserve it, don't I?

09:11.080 --> 09:13.640
Yeah. [Laughs]

09:13.800 --> 09:16.400
Maybe we should have
a little holiday, yeah?

09:16.560 --> 09:18.240
You, me and bump?

09:18.400 --> 09:21.840
Aw, I'd love that. [Giggles]

09:22.000 --> 09:24.840
All right, do you want
to say goodbye? Yeah.

09:25.000 --> 09:26.560
Putting you on.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.600
What did he say?

09:32.760 --> 09:35.760
[Laughs] Aw.

09:35.920 --> 09:37.840
Yeah, I'll speak
to you later, love.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.600
All right, yeah. I don't
know where I'll be, but...

09:41.840 --> 09:43.320
Okay.

09:43.480 --> 09:45.200
No, I'm going now.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.920
- So, he met her at the council office?
- Yes.

09:54.080 --> 09:57.960
Some assistant to head
of planning bimbo. French.

09:58.120 --> 10:00.776
Yes, I sometimes wish I'd never
dreamt of a double-height conservatory,

10:00.800 --> 10:02.800
let alone pushing it through
to the planning stage.

10:02.880 --> 10:05.120
Yes, I feel sorry for
him, really, you know?

10:05.280 --> 10:07.280
- Men can't help themselves, can they?
- No.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.256
Especially if there's a
younger model involved.

10:09.280 --> 10:10.600
- Well...
- Not that I'm saying...

10:10.640 --> 10:12.480
Oh, no. I'm sure you
feel as I do, Tania,

10:12.640 --> 10:14.960
that men are very threatened
by a mature woman, aren't they?

10:15.120 --> 10:16.480
So...

10:16.640 --> 10:18.360
You know, but on the
plus side, you know, um,

10:18.480 --> 10:19.880
it has meant that I'm free,

10:20.040 --> 10:21.920
- and I've had a couple of dates with...
- Ooh.

10:22.080 --> 10:24.080
The odd person from
the badminton league,

10:24.240 --> 10:26.240
but no one with
really any real oomph.

10:26.400 --> 10:28.280
Well, those chaps
are very hard to find.

10:28.440 --> 10:30.320
- Yes, aren't they just?
- Mmm.

10:30.480 --> 10:33.640
Yes, still, there we are. But here
we are with one on our own doorstep.

10:34.240 --> 10:35.720
Mr loftus?

10:35.880 --> 10:39.600
No, no, no, no. The
very attractive dr kersley.

10:40.840 --> 10:42.320
Ah.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.320
Is he taken or...

10:44.480 --> 10:46.520
Yes. He's... He's been
married for seven years.

10:46.680 --> 10:49.240
Has he? Has he?
Yes, well, that figures.

10:49.400 --> 10:51.600
Not always happily, but...

10:53.120 --> 10:55.840
I thought... you do
know he's married to me?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.000
- Yes, yes, I do.
- [Both laughing]

10:58.160 --> 11:01.040
I'm just pulling your leg. Um...

11:01.200 --> 11:02.600
I'll... We'll speak later, yes?

11:02.760 --> 11:03.936
- Okay. Bye-bye.
- All right, thanks so much.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.360
Yes, bye-bye.

11:09.080 --> 11:10.880
Oh, sorry, hansley.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.520
Morning, gents.
I'm just going to...

11:15.680 --> 11:18.840
- Here you go.
- Oh, cheers. Thanks, Kim.

11:23.840 --> 11:26.600
Damaris said, by the way, if
anyone comes in looking a bit chavvy,

11:26.760 --> 11:28.440
we've got to be really
nice to them, yeah?

11:28.600 --> 11:30.160
But I'm always nice to everyone.

11:30.320 --> 11:31.720
Yeah, well, it will be Dani.

11:31.880 --> 11:33.800
Minogue or la rue?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.640
No. The dignity and
nutrition inspectorate.

11:35.760 --> 11:37.120
[Phone ringing]

11:38.720 --> 11:41.720
Hello, ward k2. Kim speaking.

11:41.880 --> 11:46.000
Dave. I told you not to call
on this phone. Oh, all right.

11:46.160 --> 11:47.400
- Right.
- Kim: Dr Moore?

11:47.560 --> 11:49.056
No, sorry, I need to start
ward round, thank you.

11:49.080 --> 11:51.600
Kim: No, it... it's Dave,
about changing your locks.

11:51.760 --> 11:56.000
Ah, right. Okay, yes. Excuse
me, gents, I'll just take this. Yes.

11:56.160 --> 11:59.480
Er, hello. Hello, mr wilde. Yes.

11:59.640 --> 12:03.560
I have been given legal advice that,
um, I do need to change all the locks.

12:03.720 --> 12:08.320
Every point in the property
needs to be secure, so... mmm.

12:08.480 --> 12:10.560
[Whispering] Divorce
is so sad, isn't it?

12:10.720 --> 12:13.600
The cylinder mortise has
the internal knob. Right.

12:13.760 --> 12:16.920
Well, satin brass if that's...
Is that more costly, or...

12:17.080 --> 12:18.840
No? Good. All right.
Yes, we'll go with that.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.520
Okay, yes. Thank you very
much, indeed. Yes, bye-bye.

12:22.720 --> 12:24.800
- Oh, sorry. Did you want to...
- Um...

12:24.960 --> 12:27.440
Right, gents, could I have
a word about taking bloods?

12:27.600 --> 12:30.720
Could you come over
here just a moment, please?

12:30.880 --> 12:34.200
-Okay to clean now?
-Yeah, it's fine, hansley. You carry on.

12:34.360 --> 12:36.800
- So, dr Duke's not talked you through all of this?
- No.

12:36.960 --> 12:38.720
Well, he's told me he has.

12:38.880 --> 12:41.400
So, I'm inclined to rather believe
him, so please do that, and...

12:41.520 --> 12:42.920
Are you divorced, hansley?

12:43.080 --> 12:46.200
- That's a bit personal, den.
- Well, most people are, Kim.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.280
I can't afford to get married.

12:48.440 --> 12:53.360
Are the cerium workers up for the
strike? Might push your wages up.

12:53.520 --> 12:56.480
-Breach of contract.
-Ah, yeah. That's it, isn't it?

12:56.640 --> 12:58.800
They've got us all over a
barrel, and not in a good way.

12:58.880 --> 13:00.840
- Pippa: Right, are we ready, sister?
- Yes.

13:01.000 --> 13:04.200
- Good. Right. Where to first?
- Um, we're going to mrs withy.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.840
- It's green bay.
- [Sighs]

13:13.240 --> 13:14.680
[Buzzing]

13:20.040 --> 13:22.480
-Hello.
-Hi. Justin Hamilton. I think you're expecting me?

13:22.640 --> 13:25.480
-That's right. Cup of coffee? Biscuit?
-A coffee would be nice.

13:25.640 --> 13:27.320
Okay. There's a seat
over there, all right?

13:27.480 --> 13:29.200
- I'll be back in a sec.
- Thanks.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.800
Um, can you gather around?

13:32.960 --> 13:38.960
When a patient has been taking
part in regular sexual intercourse

13:39.120 --> 13:41.760
into their 60s and 70s,
as this lady clearly has,

13:41.920 --> 13:44.440
as you'll see when we
have a look at the callusing,

13:44.600 --> 13:49.480
unless she's been instructed to use
a dilator, which she may have done,

13:49.640 --> 13:54.480
but either way the likelihood of atrophic
degeneration is considerably reduced.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.480
Um, and contrary
to popular belief,

13:56.640 --> 13:59.840
it's the post-menopausal vagina
that most benefits from intercourse,

14:00.000 --> 14:05.000
um, certainly from a medical
perspective, so we'll... we'll just...

14:05.160 --> 14:06.600
- Hello, mrs Willy.
- Withy.

14:06.760 --> 14:10.440
Withy. Come in, gents.
Pull the curtain to, please.

14:10.600 --> 14:12.416
- How are you feeling?
- I'm all right, thanks.

14:12.440 --> 14:13.856
Oh, I'm so pleased.
You're looking a lot better.

14:13.880 --> 14:17.000
- So, can we have a little look at your abscess?
- Okay.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.720
Lovely. Lovely, lovely.

14:18.880 --> 14:21.360
Yeah, so that's healed
up pretty nicely, gents.

14:21.520 --> 14:25.000
I mean, you can see in there
that's all looking a lot... A lot better,

14:25.160 --> 14:27.096
and I imagine you're feeling
quite a bit more comfortable?

14:27.120 --> 14:28.200
I'm... I'm so pleased.

14:28.360 --> 14:30.360
So, I wonder, would you mind

14:30.520 --> 14:33.256
if I just talked my doctors through a
couple of pointers, whilst we're here?

14:33.280 --> 14:35.000
So, gents, come on in. Um...

14:35.160 --> 14:37.720
What we were referring to
earlier, what I was telling you about,

14:37.880 --> 14:41.680
we've got the, er, classic
fusion of labia majora and minora.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.096
I don't think you
can see, can you?

14:43.120 --> 14:44.640
Can you pop your
head right in, please?

14:44.760 --> 14:47.720
Um, we're not getting thinning
too badly around the urethra,

14:47.880 --> 14:49.680
which can be a locus
of great discomfort.

14:49.840 --> 14:52.760
Sorry, doctor, would you
mind if I just sat down? I'm just...

14:52.920 --> 14:55.200
-Are you all right?
-I just feel a bit tired. I'm...

14:55.360 --> 14:57.360
I'm an expectant mother.

14:57.520 --> 14:59.560
Female intern:
Ah, congratulations.

14:59.720 --> 15:02.640
-Den: Thank you.
-Goodness! Goodness me. Well...

15:02.800 --> 15:05.920
Gosh, you're a brave lady, sister. I'm
not sure I'd want all of that at our age.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.120
Yeah, it will keep me young.

15:07.160 --> 15:10.280
Yes, or send you to
an early grave. Um...

15:10.440 --> 15:13.560
Jolly good. So, yes, thank
you very much, indeed.

15:13.720 --> 15:15.376
I think we'll move on from
there. Thank you, sister.

15:15.400 --> 15:18.440
Could you organise a tto for this lady,
please? Um, sitting down, if you must.

15:18.480 --> 15:20.440
And... All right,
shall we head out?

15:20.600 --> 15:23.040
Don't draw the curtain back,
please. Just slip out of the...

15:23.200 --> 15:25.200
Thank you. Please, a little...

15:25.360 --> 15:28.760
Sorry about that. I expect the
sister will, um, sort that out for you.

15:28.920 --> 15:32.240
Thank you so much. Den, can
I give you that? There we go.

15:40.320 --> 15:42.400
- Doris: Can I have a coffee?
- Nurse.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.640
Kim: Um, Doris, can
you go back to bed?

15:44.800 --> 15:47.280
You know you're not allowed to
have coffee. Come on, off you go.

15:47.360 --> 15:50.720
Could you move this, please? It's one
of my observation stations. Thank you.

16:04.640 --> 16:06.960
Kim: Doris! No, that
is not yours, is it?

16:07.120 --> 16:08.936
- Is there something I can do?
- No, honestly, you're all right.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.696
- I'll get you another coffee in just a sec.
- Are you sure?

16:10.720 --> 16:11.896
-Please have a seat. Thank you.
-Okay.

16:11.920 --> 16:13.720
Kim: No, to me. Please.

16:13.880 --> 16:16.640
- [Clattering]
- Doris!

16:16.800 --> 16:18.520
Den: Oh! Oh, no, Kim!

16:18.680 --> 16:21.800
It's gone right through to my socks.
- Oh. Oh, don't worry, hils.

16:21.960 --> 16:24.480
I've got some... I've got some
pop socks. Don't tread in it.

16:24.640 --> 16:28.520
- Doris, back to bed, please.
- [Exhales]

16:28.680 --> 16:30.856
[Whispering] Listen, don't make
too much of a big thing out of it.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.880
That's the Dani inspector, okay?

16:33.040 --> 16:35.760
I'm just observing.
I'm invisible.

16:35.920 --> 16:37.840
Den: Sorry about that, hils.

16:38.000 --> 16:42.320
She's not allowed coffee. She gets
all jittery. She had 12 cups yesterday.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.680
They are clean.

16:45.240 --> 16:46.680
Oh, thanks.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.760
Kim: What was the name
of your first pet, Damaris?

16:52.920 --> 16:56.000
- Why?
- Kim: So I can work out your lap-dancing name.

16:56.160 --> 16:57.520
Oh, do it on me. Do it on me.

16:57.680 --> 17:00.000
Kim: All right, den. What
was your first pet's name?

17:00.160 --> 17:03.920
- Len. He was a hamster.
- Kim: Right, and what's your mother's maiden name?

17:04.080 --> 17:05.080
Baggett.

17:05.160 --> 17:07.040
Kim: Len baggett?

17:07.200 --> 17:10.520
I think that sounds more like a tripe-and-onion
seller than a lap dancer, doesn't it?

17:10.600 --> 17:13.560
- Mine will be candy horncastle.
- [Laughs]

17:13.720 --> 17:15.480
Nothing ever works on me.

17:15.640 --> 17:18.480
Kim: Well, you hardly need to
work as a lap dancer, do you, den?

17:18.640 --> 17:20.920
You're gonna be up in Leicester,

17:21.080 --> 17:23.920
living the life of Riley
with your loaded husband.

17:24.080 --> 17:27.640
Oh, no, I'm not leaving. No,
no, I was never gonna be leaving.

17:27.800 --> 17:29.920
[Whispering] I'm not
resigning, Kim, not anymore.

17:30.080 --> 17:32.800
But you... You've let your
flat. You've moved to Leicester.

17:32.960 --> 17:35.000
You can't spend more than
a week in the on-call room.

17:35.080 --> 17:38.360
I know, but I've... I've got a
plan b, just till my maternity leave.

17:38.520 --> 17:39.680
Yeah?

17:45.080 --> 17:47.160
- No.
- Please, Kim?

17:47.320 --> 17:49.040
- Please?
- I can't, you know,

17:49.200 --> 17:51.600
I've already got ques a bwengu.

17:51.760 --> 17:53.480
If I'm going to get
into medical school,

17:53.640 --> 17:56.800
I need the evenings free to
study my nursing modules.

17:56.960 --> 17:59.600
Well, thanks very much, Kim.

17:59.760 --> 18:02.160
I'll help you find a
b&amp;B, den, all right?

18:02.320 --> 18:03.880
Yeah, I am pregnant,
you know, Kim.

18:07.360 --> 18:09.800
Sorry, Damaris, I
don't feel very well.

18:09.960 --> 18:12.480
Would it be all right if I went
and got a glass of water, please?

18:12.560 --> 18:14.520
- Damaris: Of course, den.
- Thank you.

18:27.640 --> 18:30.840
No, no, I haven't done
any mandatory training.

18:32.520 --> 18:33.760
Right.

18:33.920 --> 18:36.600
So, I'd have to do four
years at medical school?

18:36.760 --> 18:38.360
A bsc?

18:38.520 --> 18:41.120
Do I really have to become
a degree nurse first?

18:41.280 --> 18:42.680
Oh, god. Can you
hang on a minute?

18:42.840 --> 18:45.240
I'm going to have
to write this all down.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.800
[Bed whirring]

18:52.160 --> 18:55.200
Doris. Can you stop
fiddling? Stop fiddling.

18:55.360 --> 18:57.416
- Look, that looks quite nice, doesn't it?
- [Whirring]

18:57.440 --> 19:00.120
- Don't you think? Please.
- [Whirring continues]

19:01.000 --> 19:02.720
Have a go at that.

19:07.280 --> 19:08.640
A bit of fish?

19:10.680 --> 19:12.480
[Sighs]

19:12.640 --> 19:16.680
That dementia care assistant's
not exactly pulling his weight, is he?

19:16.840 --> 19:20.240
God, I am sick of working
with these volunteers.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.480
He's the Dani guy.
I thought you knew.

19:22.640 --> 19:23.640
What?

19:30.480 --> 19:32.240
Come along, Doris.

19:32.400 --> 19:35.320
Yes, I've got some lovely lunch
for you here. Get your strength up.

19:35.480 --> 19:37.120
Can you take me out?

19:37.280 --> 19:42.040
Oh, Doris, I can't take you out
today. We've been very badly let down.

19:42.200 --> 19:43.960
The care assistant
hasn't arrived.

19:45.360 --> 19:46.680
[Groans softly]

20:11.080 --> 20:12.720
- Ah, den. Hello.
- Ah.

20:12.880 --> 20:14.800
Um, do you mind if I join you? I'm...
- No.

20:14.960 --> 20:17.160
I can't chat, actually,
'cause I'm expecting a call.

20:17.320 --> 20:22.040
Mmm, neither can I, because my husband's
due to phone me back any minute, so...

20:22.200 --> 20:24.200
Right. Oh, good. Oh, yes.

20:26.800 --> 20:28.120
[Den clears throat]

20:38.000 --> 20:39.640
- Nice day?
- [Phone rings]

20:39.800 --> 20:42.680
Sorry, I will have to get this,
actually. Sorry. Excuse me.

20:42.840 --> 20:46.120
Hello, Jennifer. How
are we getting on?

20:46.280 --> 20:50.440
No, but it is irretrievable breakdown
due to unreasonable behaviour. His.

20:50.600 --> 20:52.376
Yes, but if we set the
court date for next year,

20:52.400 --> 20:55.040
I'll be rattling around that house
for seven months minimum.

20:58.320 --> 21:03.120
No, no, no, they've moved. They've
moved in with him and Michelle, yes.

21:03.280 --> 21:06.400
All right, perhaps we should petition
for... on the grounds of adultery, then,

21:06.560 --> 21:09.240
if he's going to be like that.

21:09.400 --> 21:12.200
- Thanks, Jen. Okay, bye-bye.
- [Phone beeps]

21:16.520 --> 21:18.960
Sorry, you're meant
to clear your tray.

21:28.280 --> 21:30.840
Are you not feeling
hungry today, Doris?

21:31.000 --> 21:32.360
No?

21:32.520 --> 21:35.120
Den: £115 for bed and breakfast?

21:35.920 --> 21:37.120
For one night?

21:38.600 --> 21:40.440
Okay.

21:40.600 --> 21:43.960
No, I've tried them, but they've got
some kind of conference on, I think.

21:44.120 --> 21:47.160
Okay, I'll give them a ring.
Thanks ever so much for your help.

21:47.880 --> 21:49.680
Yeah, bye.

[Phone beeps]

21:51.680 --> 21:52.800
[Sighing]

21:54.360 --> 21:56.280
Couldn't you put
Darren in with Sally?

21:56.440 --> 21:58.480
He's too old for that.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.400
Well, I've given you a
hand with the lunches,

22:00.440 --> 22:02.920
so that should take some of
the pressure off, den, okay?

22:03.080 --> 22:06.720
Thank you so much, Damaris.
I'm just really knackered today.

22:06.880 --> 22:09.480
[Exhales] Yeah, I think the baby's
having a bit of a growth spurt.

22:12.400 --> 22:15.000
Kim, can you go and put the
sheets on that bed, please?

22:15.160 --> 22:18.400
- It's just I can't help you because of my condition.
- Of course.

22:18.560 --> 22:20.040
I would if I could, honestly.

22:23.040 --> 22:27.520
Yeah, is that tourist information
office? Thank you, cheers.

23:11.360 --> 23:13.440
Den, can I see you
a second, please?

23:15.920 --> 23:18.560
You've got a dignity and
nutrition inspector over there,

23:18.720 --> 23:23.000
and you lot have incompetently fed
an Alzheimer sufferer three lunches.

23:23.160 --> 23:24.840
Not two, den, three.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.600
Oh, shit.

23:26.760 --> 23:29.920
Front this up now. You don't
want this getting upstairs.

23:39.280 --> 23:40.640
[Clears throat]

23:41.400 --> 23:42.680
- Hiya.
- Hi.

23:42.840 --> 23:45.800
- Can I, yes, clear that away for you?
- Yes, yeah.

23:45.960 --> 23:49.000
I'm so sorry, um, about
the mix-up over lunch.

23:49.160 --> 23:51.416
-Oh, that's all right. Not a problem.
-Are you sure it's okay?

23:51.440 --> 23:53.760
- Yeah, really, it's fine.
- Thank you.

23:53.920 --> 23:57.760
-Is there anything I can do?
-No, no, please, honestly. You just stay where you are.

23:57.920 --> 23:59.960
Can I get you a hot
beverage of any kind?

24:00.120 --> 24:02.000
Um, yeah, tea would be great.

24:02.800 --> 24:04.080
- Kim.
- Mmm-hmm?

24:04.240 --> 24:05.456
Can you make a nice
cup of tea, please?

24:05.480 --> 24:07.280
I only make nasty cups of tea.

24:07.440 --> 24:10.080
- And then can you clear away his tray?
- Yes.

24:10.800 --> 24:12.840
[Coffee pouring]

24:13.000 --> 24:15.440
Oh, not on the floor, Doris.

24:15.600 --> 24:16.640
Coffee.

24:17.040 --> 24:18.320
[Sighs]

24:23.880 --> 24:27.240
Have a little snooze
there, Doris, yeah?

24:27.400 --> 24:29.720
I don't know why dr Harvey
doesn't just give her something.

24:29.880 --> 24:32.120
- You know, take the edge off it.
- Mmm-hmm.

24:32.280 --> 24:34.840
What does Harvey say about
how long she's got, though?

24:35.000 --> 24:38.280
Oh, he says three
or four months, but...

24:38.440 --> 24:39.800
- six weeks more likely.
- Really?

24:39.880 --> 24:41.240
- Oh, dear.
- Mmm.

24:51.080 --> 24:54.600
Does she work for the town
council or the county council?

24:54.760 --> 24:56.800
Oh, I don't know.

24:56.960 --> 24:58.416
Well, Hayley just said that dr Moore's
husband had run off with someone

24:58.440 --> 25:00.280
from the planning
department, that's all.

25:00.440 --> 25:02.560
Do you want me to have a look?

25:02.720 --> 25:04.480
- Um...
- [Keys clacking]

25:06.000 --> 25:08.240
She's French, I know that.

25:08.400 --> 25:11.560
Oh, look here, planning
department. I've got it, I think.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.520
Oh! Ooh, they've got pictures.

25:19.280 --> 25:22.120
-[Wheezing laugh] Michelle dupont?
-Oh, my god.

25:22.280 --> 25:24.280
[In French accent]
Michelle dupont!

25:24.440 --> 25:26.320
Kim: Bloody hell, den.

25:26.480 --> 25:28.096
Den: She loves holidays
on the isle of wight.

25:28.120 --> 25:30.760
She collects Paddington bears,
and she loves to bake, I mean...

25:30.920 --> 25:33.080
It can't be her, can it?

25:33.240 --> 25:36.000
Well, maybe Philip
likes an iced finger.

25:47.440 --> 25:49.960
Ah, den, is my
18-weeker comfortable?

25:50.120 --> 25:53.680
Er, yes, she's, um, just waiting to
go down for the mri scan in green bay.

25:53.840 --> 25:56.160
Lovely, I'll liaise with the
night staff. Don't worry.

25:56.320 --> 25:57.880
I'm going to be
working late so...

25:58.040 --> 25:59.400
- Oh, Kim.
- Yeah.

25:59.560 --> 26:01.640
- Did that b&amp;B phone back?
- No.

26:01.800 --> 26:03.880
- Oh, it's so rude.
- Are you stuck for a bed?

26:04.040 --> 26:05.960
No. Well, yeah, but I...

26:06.120 --> 26:08.920
I've got five empty bedrooms in
my house. It's ridiculous, isn't it?

26:09.080 --> 26:12.680
- [Laughs] - Kim: Well, maybe
den could stay at your place, then?

26:12.840 --> 26:14.720
Er, although, no.

26:14.880 --> 26:17.880
Well, the thermostats are all turned
down, and the bed's not been aired,

26:18.040 --> 26:19.800
- so it wouldn't be very...
- No, i'm...

26:19.960 --> 26:22.040
But, I mean, another
time, you know, absolutely,

26:22.200 --> 26:23.816
- if you want to give me a bit of notice...
- Great.

26:23.840 --> 26:25.640
Do, er, do that.

26:25.800 --> 26:28.320
But she'll need somewhere
next week as well.

26:28.480 --> 26:31.600
- Um...
- I think I'll be fine, actually, Kim.

26:31.760 --> 26:33.560
Well, if you... Well,
do give me a shout.

26:33.720 --> 26:36.440
Er... yes. Yes, do...
Do give me a shout.

26:36.600 --> 26:40.440
I'm only kidding, dr Moore. It's all
right, she's sleeping on my settee.

26:40.600 --> 26:42.320
Oh, right.

26:42.480 --> 26:46.200
Well, you know, any
time. Any time, obviously.

26:58.120 --> 27:01.560
Thank you so much for coming.
Well, it's been lovely to meet you.

27:01.720 --> 27:03.720
And you. I just feel like
I haven't really helped.

27:03.880 --> 27:06.560
No, no. Oh, you've
been so understanding.

27:06.720 --> 27:08.520
- Sorry, but we've got to go.
- Okay.

27:08.680 --> 27:09.720
- Amma?
- Yeah.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.680
Here are the handover
notes. Sorry about this.

27:11.720 --> 27:14.720
It's just that the shuttle bus
goes at five to. It's so stupid.

27:14.880 --> 27:16.176
- Kim: Come on, den. Den!
- Amma: Don't worry.

27:16.200 --> 27:18.240
Hurry up, get out of here.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.160
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, Damaris, sorry.

27:20.320 --> 27:23.640
I don't feel very well, and Kim said
she might be able to take me home.

27:23.800 --> 27:26.760
- Oh, no, you go on. You need to look after yourself, den.
- Thank you.

27:26.920 --> 27:29.560
Oh, just quickly, though, Kim, I
was speaking to evay in admissions,

27:29.640 --> 27:31.520
and she said you're
taking your bsc in nursing?

27:31.680 --> 27:34.520
Yeah, that's right. So I
was only gonna do that

27:34.680 --> 27:37.440
so I could fast-track through
to medical school, so...

27:37.600 --> 27:39.720
Gosh, that's impressive,
nurse. Good for you.

27:39.880 --> 27:43.400
I suppose you'll have a short career,
but, well, I'm sure a very useful one.

27:43.560 --> 27:45.360
Sorry, I just do
feel really queasy.

27:45.520 --> 27:47.600
- Okay, if it's, yeah...
- Damaris: Go ahead, den.

got 12 minutes to get...

- Sorry, who are you?

I'm the dementia care assistant.

27:58.400 --> 27:59.720
Oh, right. Yes,
I'm sure you can.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.800
Uh, could you tell the
lady that was here before

28:01.960 --> 28:03.880
that I don't think I'll
be volunteering again?

28:04.040 --> 28:06.000
I don't pass on messages, sorry.

28:06.160 --> 28:09.200
- Oh. Well, then, I'll e-mail, then?
- Yes, why not?
