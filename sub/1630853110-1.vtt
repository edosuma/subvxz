[footsteps trudging]

00:43.377 --> 00:45.587
[footsteps continue]

00:52.719 --> 00:54.805
[wind blowing, leaves rustling]

01:23.792 --> 01:26.003
My mother was not a fortunate woman.

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
And bringing me into the world

01:29.173 --> 01:31.175
was a great burden for her to bear.

01:33.385 --> 01:36.555
When I was still very young, she passed.

01:38.140 --> 01:40.309
Grieving, my father took to drink.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.228
Which is why myselfand my three older sisters

01:43.312 --> 01:45.397
wound up begging in the village.

01:46.565 --> 01:49.985
The matchmakercame to my father one day…

01:51.486 --> 01:55.991
and told him of a familywith a boarding house in Dongsam.

01:56.074 --> 01:59.912
Their son had a cleft lipand was unmarried, of course.

02:01.121 --> 02:03.624
I was offered up gladly.

02:05.626 --> 02:08.794
That was aboutthree years ago, a little more.

02:08.878 --> 02:12.633
I've tried my very best to do rightby their family and my husband.

02:17.429 --> 02:19.223
I've given birth to three sons.

02:22.309 --> 02:24.603
None lived to see his first birthday.

02:27.564 --> 02:29.566
If it were only me,

02:29.650 --> 02:31.652
I could weather the shock.

02:32.444 --> 02:33.862
But my husband…

02:35.155 --> 02:37.241
He is the kindest of men.[breathes shakily]

02:40.869 --> 02:43.997
I am with child, but…

02:46.041 --> 02:48.669
I think there is some curse on my blood.

02:56.301 --> 02:58.929
[siren wailing in distance]

03:25.664 --> 03:26.665
[elevator dings]

03:40.262 --> 03:43.140
[manager 1, in English]Listen, there's no easy way to say this.

03:43.974 --> 03:46.143
You're not getting the bump.

03:46.226 --> 03:47.352
Not this year.

03:47.436 --> 03:49.730
I know we gave youall the signs otherwise,

03:49.813 --> 03:52.232
-but the 43rd floor believes…-[pager beeping]

03:52.316 --> 03:55.777
… it's better for you if you haveone more year under your belt.

04:02.409 --> 04:03.410
I want to know why.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.746
He told you why.They don't think you're ready.

04:06.371 --> 04:08.498
Keep busting ahead,doing what you're doing, and--

04:08.582 --> 04:10.209
I helped close the Teestone merger.

04:10.292 --> 04:11.710
Handled Brixley's buyout.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.629
Number one on my leaderboard for two--

04:13.712 --> 04:15.964
It's not your year, okay?

04:21.637 --> 04:24.681
[spouse] Please call onmy ancestors to lift this curse

04:24.765 --> 04:26.600
so we can have a family.

04:31.855 --> 04:34.066
[sighs] Mmm.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.836

05:01.510 --> 05:03.428

05:04.054 --> 05:06.098
Priority client, itching to go public.

05:06.181 --> 05:08.183
Their valuation needs an adrenaline shot.

05:08.809 --> 05:09.893
They need that hotel.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.186
That's in Tokyo.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.439
Where one landowner, one,holds the entire deal hostage.

05:14.523 --> 05:16.358
[drum beating faster]

05:21.905 --> 05:23.824
[employee] She's Korean, the landowner.

05:26.118 --> 05:28.704
Doesn't mean anything to you, I know.But I'm telling you…

05:29.288 --> 05:30.581
I can close that deal.

05:33.959 --> 05:35.085
[manager 2] What do you know?

05:35.169 --> 05:39.131

05:40.883 --> 05:41.800

05:41.884 --> 05:46.221
Back of the napkin calculations say10-15 million payday for us.

05:46.305 --> 05:49.641
And this landowner, her being Korean,you think that'll give you an in?

05:49.725 --> 05:52.060
Wait, I'm confused here.I thought you were Japanese.

05:52.144 --> 05:54.188
No, I just grew up there.

05:55.564 --> 05:58.192
-[manager 2] You sure about this?-Yes, I'm sure.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.613
And once I close this deal,I want to be transferred back right away. And once I close this deal,I want to be transferred back right away.

06:04.740 --> 06:08.660
I want that VP titleand the raise backdated to today's date.

06:10.621 --> 06:13.248
And I want my year-end bonus to reflect

06:13.332 --> 06:16.543
just how muchColton Hotels means to this firm.

06:19.004 --> 06:20.506
[drum stops]

06:20.589 --> 06:22.216
And I would like all this in writing.

06:23.842 --> 06:25.052
[spouse breathes shakily]

06:26.803 --> 06:29.223
True, a child is coming.

06:30.641 --> 06:33.977
She will thrive, I assure you.

06:35.437 --> 06:38.690
And through her, a family will endure.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.490

07:03.465 --> 07:04.800

07:04.883 --> 07:06.510
She's a handful all right.

07:07.261 --> 07:08.720
Thank you so much.

07:08.804 --> 07:10.764
[midwife] Take good care of her.

07:10.848 --> 07:11.974
[chuckles]

07:13.392 --> 07:15.561
[father] This one will put up a fight.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.022
We must name her now.

07:41.753 --> 07:42.754
[father] Sunja!

[in Japanese] Good. You put on weight.

11:26.854 --> 11:27.938
Too much pizza.

11:28.021 --> 11:29.731
I need to watch myself.

11:29.815 --> 11:30.983
How's Tokyo?

11:31.066 --> 11:32.484
The new place, is it nice?

11:32.568 --> 11:35.404
It's a hotel room.It's fine for a few weeks.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.948
[chuckles] Is he here? Is that Solomon?

11:38.031 --> 11:39.867
Mr. Goto! I should've known you'd be here.

11:40.450 --> 11:42.411
Your dad owns this place now,

11:42.494 --> 11:44.872
but I still have to make surehe's managing the place.

11:44.955 --> 11:46.248
Keep telling yourself that,

11:46.331 --> 11:49.960
but the real reason you come hereis to flirt with the young girls.

12:04.391 --> 12:07.019
[Hirota] Not bad for the sonof a pachinko man.

12:07.603 --> 12:10.606
Is it true you went to Yale?

12:11.106 --> 12:14.067
If my father says so,it must be true. [chuckles]

12:14.151 --> 12:18.155
[interviewer] Mr. Yoshii,how do you respond to the allegations?

12:18.238 --> 12:20.741
I understand there arethose in the financial world

12:20.824 --> 12:22.534
who do not trust us

12:22.618 --> 12:25.621
because of what my grandfatherwas involved in…

12:25.704 --> 12:27.372
[interviewer continues indistinctly]

12:27.456 --> 12:28.707
Who's his grandfather?

12:29.541 --> 12:32.294
A man who is dead and gone.

12:32.878 --> 12:34.671
Nothing to do with us.

[chattering resumes]

14:04.845 --> 14:07.014
[eel vendor] Hey, you're late today.

14:07.598 --> 14:09.057
I saved this one for you.

14:09.141 --> 14:10.267
[grunts]

14:13.187 --> 14:14.188
[Sunja] That one.

14:15.022 --> 14:18.025
Sunja! Ha-ha!

14:19.693 --> 14:21.904
Ho-ho! There she is!

14:23.155 --> 14:25.115
[Sunja] It doesn't look very happy.

14:25.199 --> 14:28.368
That's because eventhe lowliest creatures on this earth

14:28.452 --> 14:30.621
struggle to remain alive.

14:30.704 --> 14:32.080
Not the chestnut merchant.

14:32.164 --> 14:36.585
She complains all the time thatdeath keeps thumbing his nose at her.

14:36.668 --> 14:40.422
That's because her husbandis all sweetness and light outside,

14:40.506 --> 14:45.135
but when he gets home, he startsbeating on his wife and his children.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.012
But still, she has the will to live.

14:48.388 --> 14:49.389
Let's go.

14:50.516 --> 14:52.893
-Hey there!-[vendor] Oh.

14:53.477 --> 14:55.020
Isn't this one fine?

14:55.103 --> 14:58.732
I bet you can't show mea better catch, not today.

14:59.233 --> 15:00.984
It's huge. What can I do with it? It's huge. What can I do with it?

15:01.068 --> 15:04.279
Your fish cakes are the bestin the market, Mr. Kim.

15:04.363 --> 15:07.616
You always sell out of them before noon.

15:07.699 --> 15:09.493
But with this big guy right here,

15:09.576 --> 15:13.413
you can make enough fish cakesto last for weeks.

15:13.497 --> 15:15.874
In that case, I'll give you 30 for it, OK?

15:15.958 --> 15:17.918
Oh, sorry. No.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.712
-It's worth around three times that.-[Mr. Kim] Is that so?

15:20.796 --> 15:22.965
What does this brat know about prices?

15:23.048 --> 15:24.174
I know something.

15:24.258 --> 15:26.760
I know the man in the daegu jorim stand,

15:26.844 --> 15:30.347
right down this aisle,gave him double for a puny cod.

15:30.430 --> 15:32.391
-And so let's go see him now.-Mmm.

15:32.474 --> 15:34.977
Wait a minute, why would you goall the way to the other side?

15:37.104 --> 15:38.355
Eighty.

15:38.438 --> 15:40.065
That's final. Take it or leave it.

15:41.316 --> 15:42.526
And it's a fair price.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.027
That price is OK.

15:44.736 --> 15:45.779
[laughs]

15:47.656 --> 15:49.867
-[grunts]-Good. Many thanks.

15:50.409 --> 15:53.036
Here! Your share.

15:54.329 --> 15:55.330
Oh…

15:55.873 --> 15:57.541
I'm not allowed to take it.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.002
Why not? You earned it. Why not? You earned it.

16:00.085 --> 16:02.629
Didn't your parents teach youto listen to your elders?

16:03.881 --> 16:05.716
-[giggles]-[laughs]

16:05.799 --> 16:06.633
Sunja…

16:06.717 --> 16:09.595
Well, well!You'll need to keep an eye on this one.

16:09.678 --> 16:12.639
She won't be satisfiedwith just running a boarding house!

16:12.723 --> 16:14.600
-[whistle blows]-[vendor] I did no such thing!

16:14.683 --> 16:17.144
We have two signed statementsto the contrary.

16:17.227 --> 16:19.855
Well, they're all lies.I'm not involved in any of that--

16:19.938 --> 16:21.857
We'll talk at the station. Come with us.

16:21.940 --> 16:22.941
[vendor] No! I'm begging you--

16:23.025 --> 16:25.444
[grunts] Beg at the station.

16:26.862 --> 16:27.863
[fisherman sighs]

16:28.906 --> 16:31.408
When they said they'd ease upon the harassment,

16:31.491 --> 16:33.160
is this what they meant?

16:35.204 --> 16:36.205
Sunja.

16:37.122 --> 16:38.165
Should we go now?

16:39.750 --> 16:40.792
[fisherman] OK.

16:40.876 --> 16:43.879
See you back at the house. [chuckles]

16:48.133 --> 16:48.967
Papa.

16:50.469 --> 16:52.804
The man we saw in the market earlier…

16:53.639 --> 16:55.265
… did he do something bad?

16:56.099 --> 16:57.309
I don't know.

16:57.893 --> 16:59.311
Truth is, nowadays…

17:00.646 --> 17:04.358
… it's hard for us to judgebetween guilt or innocence.

17:06.902 --> 17:09.112
What will happen to him now?

17:09.988 --> 17:12.449
Will he be allowed to go home or not?

17:13.534 --> 17:14.535
Sunja.

17:16.328 --> 17:17.871
I once made a vow to you.

17:19.540 --> 17:21.791
When you were barely a week old…

17:22.376 --> 17:25.212
… your mother and Iwould stay up every night.

17:27.381 --> 17:30.217
All our days and nights,we watched over you.

17:31.718 --> 17:34.137
That's when I made you this solemn vow…

17:35.681 --> 17:38.559
… that as long as you drew breath,

17:38.642 --> 17:40.644
there's nothing I wouldn't do

17:40.727 --> 17:43.397
to ward off all the ugliness in this world

17:43.480 --> 17:45.023
and keep it far away from you.

17:47.150 --> 17:48.277
Mmm.

17:49.653 --> 17:52.573
You should know I will honor that vow.

19:47.437 --> 19:51.275
No matter how much you practiced,it never did you any good.

19:51.859 --> 19:53.735
Then why did you never allow me to quit?

19:54.319 --> 19:56.446
You know what I paid for that piano?

19:56.530 --> 19:57.531
Sure I do!

19:57.614 --> 19:59.825
You reminded me of that every day.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.202
[scoffs] Well, you needed reminding. [scoffs] Well, you needed reminding.

20:02.286 --> 20:06.665
Now stop acting like a lazy Americanand come here and give me a hand.

20:06.748 --> 20:07.958
[Solomon] All right.

20:45.329 --> 20:48.790
So you go taking money from that manwhen he can barely get by with his catch?

20:48.874 --> 20:50.292
Let it go.

20:51.960 --> 20:53.921
And as for you!

20:54.004 --> 20:56.423
Your indulgenceisn't helping your daughter.

20:58.050 --> 21:00.010
All this talk aboutsending her to school… All this talk aboutsending her to school…

21:00.093 --> 21:01.345
What good would that do?

21:02.429 --> 21:04.348
Easy times, hard times…

21:04.431 --> 21:06.433
It's all the same when you're a woman.

21:07.059 --> 21:08.810
She must learn to feed herself.

21:12.189 --> 21:15.150
In the cove, the water is calm today.

21:15.234 --> 21:18.153
The woman will help mewith my lessons if I go.

21:18.779 --> 21:19.863
So can I go?

21:20.614 --> 21:22.032
Have you been listening or not?

21:22.699 --> 21:25.452
Mmm. Next time, I'll tell Mr. Song

21:25.536 --> 21:27.955
that I can't listen because I'm a girl.

21:28.705 --> 21:30.082
Never mind that--

21:30.165 --> 21:34.002
And because he's not much of a fisherman,he can't be giving me money.

21:34.086 --> 21:35.254
[sighs]

21:36.296 --> 21:37.756
Fine, on your way.

Listen.

21:42.678 --> 21:45.597
It's good that you love her,but you dote on her too much.

21:45.681 --> 21:46.515
[sighs]

21:46.598 --> 21:49.852
The only thing that can come of itis that you're going to spoil her.

21:49.935 --> 21:53.021
Our daughter won't be spoiledif she has a bit of candy.

21:53.105 --> 21:54.940
It wasn't your money to give!

21:55.023 --> 21:57.234
It was another's kindness.

21:58.235 --> 22:02.406
She needs to know there's such a thingas kindness in this world. She needs to know there's such a thingas kindness in this world.

22:03.657 --> 22:06.869
She'll grow up stronger for it, all right?

25:58.976 --> 26:00.978
Huh? What are you saying? Huh? What are you saying?

26:01.728 --> 26:04.022
We just let them take our land.

26:04.857 --> 26:06.024
Didn't we?

26:06.108 --> 26:10.320
They snatched our rice,our potatoes, our fish.

Calm down already.

We do no wrong. Why would they arrest us?

28:20.033 --> 28:23.036
After all he just said,we go on feeding and housing him?

28:23.120 --> 28:24.121
Isn't that wrong?

28:24.830 --> 28:26.915
If the Japanese come for us,

who will take care of Sunja?

29:25.390 --> 29:27.267
Last night you said stupid things.

29:27.351 --> 29:29.353
And now they're all scared.

29:30.354 --> 29:33.607
They're all… Who exactly is all?

29:33.690 --> 29:37.277
Everybody is scared.But no one says anything.

29:38.403 --> 29:40.405
Now they all want you to leave.

29:42.658 --> 29:45.494
But where would I go?I have nowhere to go.

29:45.577 --> 29:48.622

But you understand that.

32:35.831 --> 32:38.375
He had much too much to drink, you see.

And yet you didn't report it at the time.

33:36.683 --> 33:37.851
[officer 1] We had no choice.

33:37.935 --> 33:39.937
Push them too hard and they'll explode.

There will be no second chances.

You must eat.

35:10.444 --> 35:11.570
Look in the mirror!

35:12.613 --> 35:15.073
You're too thin. All skin and bones.

Put the green onions in.

35:18.410 --> 35:20.537

35:20.621 --> 35:22.873
Put some cold water on it. [sighs]

35:23.665 --> 35:25.334
Clearly you don't cook for yourself.

35:25.417 --> 35:27.920
Just like your father,a slave to your job.

35:30.214 --> 35:34.009
I told him to sell the pachinko parlor.Real estate is booming right now.

35:34.092 --> 35:36.011
He should invest in stores or housing.

35:36.094 --> 35:38.597
-So he hasn't told you?-Told me what?

35:38.680 --> 35:40.849
He's opening a second parlor this year.

35:42.935 --> 35:44.061
Don't look so shocked.

35:44.144 --> 35:46.396
He's been thinking about it.You knew that.

35:48.315 --> 35:49.733
And how will he finance it?

35:49.816 --> 35:51.652
How do you think?

35:51.735 --> 35:53.820
Go down to the bank and just get a loan.

35:55.781 --> 35:58.450
He's proud of what he's built.

35:59.284 --> 36:02.246
And he doesn't need your shameto knock him down the ladder. And he doesn't need your shameto knock him down the ladder.

36:02.955 --> 36:04.748
What does shame have to do with this?

You don't need to say it,I know it's there.

36:06.708 --> 36:10.629
I know what it looks like,I have a lot of experience with it.

36:10.712 --> 36:12.381
I know how to smell it and I can hear it.

36:15.342 --> 36:16.969
Now go and fetch me an egg.

36:26.728 --> 36:28.021
All right, tell me. Be honest.

36:28.981 --> 36:32.192
You're going back, right?You're not going to stay here?

36:33.151 --> 36:34.236
What do you mean by that?

36:35.112 --> 36:39.533
Some, like your dad, can fool themselvesabout how things have changed.

36:39.616 --> 36:41.827
I know that's not the case.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.830
You're safer in America.

37:18.280 --> 37:19.781
You've hardly aged.

[squeals] See? This is it.

37:21.783 --> 37:24.203
Why, those American girls must love you.

37:24.286 --> 37:26.288
I know. [giggles]

Are you crazy? Don't throw out good food!

37:34.796 --> 37:36.006
Put it down here.
