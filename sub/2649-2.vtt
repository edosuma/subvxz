WEBVTT

00:02.001 --> 00:03.925
Okay, let's see.

00:04.003 --> 00:05.881
Could you grab me
an extra-virgin-

00:06.006 --> 00:07.929
I think one's enough for the sacrifice.
Olive oil, Phil.

00:08.007 --> 00:09.681
Come on. That's funny.

00:09.760 --> 00:12.513
Oh, it's funnier than your
freestyle sandwich rap.

00:12.596 --> 00:14.849
Girl, you crazy.

00:14.932 --> 00:17.105
I'm mad fun to shop with.

00:17.184 --> 00:19.733
# Trapped in between
two whole wheat slices #

00:19.811 --> 00:22.690
# Pastrami and Swiss
are my only vices #

00:22.773 --> 00:25.697
Sweetie, my shoe.
Come on. Geez. God.

00:25.776 --> 00:26.868
Hello.

00:26.985 --> 00:28.612
Hi. Oh, roadblock. Sorry.

00:28.695 --> 00:30.242
Beep, beep. Hah, hah. Pardon me.

00:31.990 --> 00:34.288
Are you okay? Oh!

00:34.368 --> 00:37.963
Actually, not okay.
Not okay.

00:38.038 --> 00:41.133
Honey. Did you pull
from the bottom again?

00:43.502 --> 00:47.097
So after hors d'oeuvres, we'll bring
everyone in here to share the news.

00:48.423 --> 00:49.891
We're having the family over
tomorrow night ...

00:49.967 --> 00:52.686
to tell them we're planning
on adopting a new baby.

00:52.761 --> 00:56.766
Yes, and we both agreed to go a little more
low-key with the announcement this time.

00:56.848 --> 01:00.523
# Let's hear it for the boy
Ah, let's give- #

01:00.602 --> 01:04.072
Okay, just to be clear- This is low-key?

01:04.147 --> 01:06.866
It's a banner and just some light
musical accompaniment, Mitchell.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.410
I don't have a lower key.

01:08.485 --> 01:10.237
Besides,
this is a happy occasion.

01:10.320 --> 01:12.618
Am I right, Lily? Aren't you
excited to get a new baby brother?

01:12.698 --> 01:15.076
No. I hate the baby.

01:16.660 --> 01:18.754
We are having a slight issue ...

01:18.829 --> 01:21.298
getting Lily on board
with the adoption.

01:21.415 --> 01:23.088
"L hate the baby."
"No new baby."

01:23.166 --> 01:24.668
"I want to make the baby dead."

01:24.751 --> 01:27.345
I thought we weren't
gonna share that one.

01:27.421 --> 01:31.676
L-I just hope that the problem is she
hasn't spent much time with any babies.

01:31.758 --> 01:33.760
So we thought it would be
a great idea ...

01:33.844 --> 01:36.063
to show her how much fun
it'll be to have one around.

01:36.138 --> 01:39.608
Oh, he is so cute. Yeah,
and he never cries.

01:39.725 --> 01:42.899
Literally never.
it's actually a little weird.

01:42.978 --> 01:46.198
Oh, no, that's not weird. My sister was
born with a full set of teeth. Yeah.

01:46.273 --> 01:48.071
That never happened.
No? Really?

01:48.150 --> 01:50.403
You should've seen her crib. It
looked like beavers lived there.

01:50.485 --> 01:51.953
Oh, is this Lily?

01:52.029 --> 01:54.782
Oh, yes, it is. Hey, honey.
Say hi to the baby.

01:54.865 --> 01:56.993
- My daddy!
- Oh!

01:57.117 --> 02:00.166
Okay. Well,
that's one problem solved.

02:01.830 --> 02:09.840
# Hey, hey #

02:09.920 --> 02:11.093
# Hey ##

02:12.924 --> 02:14.892
Bye! See you soon.

02:16.011 --> 02:17.604
Or never.

02:17.679 --> 02:19.647
Cam, I'm a little freaked out
about what Lily did.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.270
Oh, please.
She barely touched him ...

02:21.350 --> 02:23.068
and he went from zero
to big crybaby.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.646
We're talking about bringing
another child into this house.

02:25.729 --> 02:28.949
How's that gonna work with Lily
being so possessive of you?

02:29.024 --> 02:31.402
Why am I hearing
an accusatory tone?

02:31.485 --> 02:33.829
Oh, come on. You have to admit
that you do coddle her.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.202
I will not apologize
for loving our daughter.

02:36.281 --> 02:37.578
I'm not criticizing.

02:38.909 --> 02:40.411
I'm not only criticizing,

02:40.494 --> 02:42.838
but we did talk about giving
Lily a little more independence.

02:42.913 --> 02:44.506
Yeah, which is why
we put her in preschool.

02:44.581 --> 02:47.084
Yes, but you can't bear to leave her there.
You always pick her up early.

02:47.209 --> 02:49.632
That is ridiculous.
Okay, okay.

02:49.711 --> 02:52.009
Lily, honey.

02:52.089 --> 02:53.841
Did Daddy pick you up
early from preschool today?

02:53.924 --> 02:56.598
- No.
- Case closed.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.054
We didn't go.

02:58.136 --> 03:00.389
- Case opened.
- We went shopping.

03:00.472 --> 03:02.395
That's enough.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.192
We bought matchy hats.

03:04.267 --> 03:05.769
You are going
to your room.

03:06.770 --> 03:08.693
You're both going to her room.

03:08.772 --> 03:10.524
Do we spend
a lot of time together? Yes.

03:10.607 --> 03:12.325
Do we have a special bond?
Absolutely.

03:12.401 --> 03:16.577
But do I coddle her more
than any other loving parent?

03:21.076 --> 03:22.749
Mm-hmm.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.554
It's possible.

03:32.629 --> 03:35.473
And for Lily's sake,
I should probably work on that.

03:35.549 --> 03:36.971
No, you calm down!

03:37.050 --> 03:40.350
This is how I talk when somebody
accuses my Manny of stealing!

03:40.470 --> 03:41.722
Who is that?
it's the principal.

03:41.805 --> 03:44.024
He's saying that Manny stole
some girl's locket.

03:44.099 --> 03:47.103
What? You think that all
Colombians are criminals ...

03:47.185 --> 03:51.816
because the Colombian necktie is a
symbol of violence all over the world?

03:51.898 --> 03:53.992
Oh, no,
I'm not threatening you.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.911
Okay, apology accepted.

03:56.987 --> 03:58.580
No, I didn't mean anything
about the necktie.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.453
I just- I was trying
to make a point.

04:09.249 --> 04:11.752
Could you "L"
a little less "O-L"?

04:11.835 --> 04:13.553
Don't you see what
I'm trying to do here?

04:13.670 --> 04:16.389
Die alone? Girls, dinner!

04:16.505 --> 04:20.180
Why does Luke get his own room and I still have
to share with you? I can't take it anymore.

04:20.260 --> 04:24.811
Me either. Even if it is just for one
more year, when I leave for college.

04:24.890 --> 04:26.858
Is it one more year, or when
you'll leave for college?

04:26.933 --> 04:28.856
Because those happen to be
two different things.

04:29.352 --> 04:30.478
Uh-

04:30.562 --> 04:32.781
So I hear this little voice
coming from the cans,

04:32.856 --> 04:36.076
and it's like, "Help!
I fell in the peaches!"

04:36.151 --> 04:38.404
It's Mom.

04:38.528 --> 04:40.622
Hilarious. So hilarious.
I'm, like, "Claire?"

04:40.697 --> 04:44.247
You might want to tell them that it was you who
pushed me into the peaches in the first place.

04:44.326 --> 04:45.953
This again.
I wasn't even near you.

04:46.036 --> 04:47.959
Yes, you were. You knocked
me with the cart.

04:48.038 --> 04:50.416
It was completely
your fault.

04:50.499 --> 04:52.092
Well, let's just
agree to disagree.

04:52.167 --> 04:55.546
No, I-l disagree
to disagree.

04:55.629 --> 04:57.506
Then you agree.

04:57.589 --> 04:59.933
No. No, I don't,
because I'm right.

05:01.843 --> 05:03.971
Okay, Claire.
You're right.

05:04.054 --> 05:06.227
- As usual.
- No, I am right.

05:06.306 --> 05:07.774
Like always.
Stop it.

05:07.849 --> 05:09.351
When I am wrong, I admit it.

05:09.434 --> 05:10.777
Which is never.

05:10.852 --> 05:13.071
Fine. Fine.

05:17.275 --> 05:20.404
You're a little jumpy tonight, Manny.
Anything wrong? No.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.999
Well, I'm just gonna-
Have a seat, kid.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.749
You know, maybe it's me, but I thought
you were kind of squirrelly tonight-

05:27.869 --> 05:30.668
you know, before, when your mom was
on the phone with the principal.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.669
Almost like you wanted to say
something, but you just couldn't.

05:37.420 --> 05:39.422
Anything you want to say now,
Manny?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.017
No.
I got nothing to say.

05:43.093 --> 05:44.094
You sure about that?

05:44.761 --> 05:46.809
Think real hard.

05:50.559 --> 05:52.232
Could I get
a glass of water?

05:52.310 --> 05:54.153
That girl's locket.
You took it, didn't you?

05:54.229 --> 05:56.573
Um-
Didn't you?

05:56.648 --> 05:59.492
Yes. Yes, I took it.
I didn't mean to.

05:59.568 --> 06:01.696
I don't want to hear
any excuses.

06:01.778 --> 06:04.827
You're gonna tell your mom, and you're
gonna set this right, you understand?

06:06.283 --> 06:07.910
All right, get outta here.

06:09.119 --> 06:10.996
Just one more thing.

06:11.079 --> 06:12.581
You're not, uh-

06:14.624 --> 06:16.126
You're not wearing
that locket, are you?

06:16.209 --> 06:18.837
No, of course not. it's a girl's.
Why would I want to wear it?

06:20.338 --> 06:21.840
No reason.

06:27.429 --> 06:31.059
Mom, hurry up. I
don't want to be late for school.

06:31.182 --> 06:32.684
You didn't
tell her, did you?

06:32.767 --> 06:36.647
Ay. What's the hurry
this morning?

06:39.608 --> 06:42.737
Okay, what's with the looks?
it's like a silent movie in here.

06:42.819 --> 06:46.414
Okay. I was walking behind this
girl, Alisha, who was moving away,

06:46.489 --> 06:49.868
and I was working up the courage to get
her new address so I can write her.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.122
I express myself a lot better
on paper than- Ticktock, kid.

06:53.204 --> 06:58.051
Well, she dropped her locket, and I picked
it up, but she kept walking, and I-

06:58.126 --> 07:01.721
You stole the locket.

07:01.796 --> 07:05.096
After I told the principal that you could
have never done something like that,

07:05.175 --> 07:07.394
and I threaten him
with the Colombian necktie!

07:07.469 --> 07:09.062
Manny, why?

07:09.137 --> 07:11.231
Don't worry. It wasn't
'cause he wanted to wear it.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.227
I thought I could keep it
as something to remember her by.

07:15.310 --> 07:17.404
But then you were yelling
at Mr. Vickers, and ...

07:17.479 --> 07:18.901
I was just too scared
to tell you.

07:19.022 --> 07:20.399
Go to the car.
I'm really sorry.

07:20.482 --> 07:21.483
Go.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.329
Why would he do
something like that?

07:26.404 --> 07:29.248
It's bad enough that he's the
boy with the pan ?ute ...

07:29.324 --> 07:31.747
and the puffy shirts
and-and the poems.

07:31.826 --> 07:33.453
Now he's the jewelry thief.

07:33.578 --> 07:36.502
Might be an upgrade.
Ay, Jay, this is not funny.

07:36.581 --> 07:38.299
Those things stick to you.

07:38.375 --> 07:41.128
My cousin Rosa Marina, when she
was]4, she stole something,

07:41.211 --> 07:44.761
and after that, everybody thinks of
her as the girl who steals cars.

07:44.881 --> 07:47.430
She stole a car?
Cars.

07:47.509 --> 07:50.558
But after she got that label,
what else could she do?

07:50.637 --> 07:53.982
Listen, you can't control what kids think,
but you can make sure he learns from this.

07:54.057 --> 07:55.479
You take him to
the principal's office.

07:55.558 --> 07:57.777
He owns up to it.
He never does it again.

07:57.852 --> 08:00.321
Okay, okay.

08:00.397 --> 08:01.944
But what was he thinking?

08:02.023 --> 08:03.991
This is not even real gold.

08:05.694 --> 08:09.119
No way, Haley! It was my idea!
I'm taking this room!

08:09.197 --> 08:11.120
Over my dead body!

08:11.199 --> 08:16.547
This is going to be my room, and
there's nothing you can do about it!

08:18.081 --> 08:19.958
Seriously?

08:20.041 --> 08:22.214
What are you guys
fighting about?

08:22.293 --> 08:25.672
Okay, so we both think that this would
make a totally awesome bedroom.

08:25.755 --> 08:28.759
But only one of us can have it.
Don't you think it should be me?

08:28.842 --> 08:30.765
Oh, so not. It should
be me, right, Luke?

08:30.844 --> 08:33.097
Why do you guys want to
move into the attic?

08:33.179 --> 08:35.181
Oh, you mean the penthouse?

08:35.265 --> 08:38.769
With all the privacy of being
on its very own floor?

08:40.562 --> 08:42.940
It is kinda cool.

08:44.149 --> 08:47.870
I'm not an idiot.
I knew what they were up to.

08:47.944 --> 08:50.197
But I've been wanting to move
for a while.

08:50.280 --> 08:53.375
There's a line of ants going to a
trick or treat bag in my closet,

08:53.450 --> 08:56.454
and I don't want to still be there
when they get tired of candy.

08:57.537 --> 08:59.790
Good morning, princess.
Good morning, Lily.

08:59.873 --> 09:03.468
That's very adorable, Mitchell, but
I'm having kind of a rough morning.

09:03.543 --> 09:05.341
Daddy, up.

09:05.420 --> 09:07.468
I'm sorry, Lily.
Those days are over.

09:07.547 --> 09:10.175
Now, here's your lunch.
Go get your bag.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.306
We will be leaving shortly.

09:12.385 --> 09:15.059
Cam, you don't have to
ice her out completely.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.811
Do you think
I'm enjoying this?

09:16.890 --> 09:19.439
But I need her to detach from me
before the new thing comes,

09:19.517 --> 09:21.190
or who knows
what she'll do to it.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.522
Why are you saying "thing"
instead of "baby"?

09:23.605 --> 09:25.573
Kill new baby.

09:25.648 --> 09:26.649
Oh.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.735
Um, look,
I-l know this is hard,

09:28.818 --> 09:30.912
but I really appreciate
what you're doing.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.116
And believe me, I take no pleasure
in seeing you suffer like this.

09:34.199 --> 09:36.293
I take a little pleasure.

09:36.367 --> 09:39.246
No, but there are very few parenting
issues where I come out on top.

09:39.329 --> 09:42.424
You know, I'm distant.
I work too much.

09:42.499 --> 09:45.469
My French braiding is "sloppy."

09:45.543 --> 09:48.387
Finally, you know,
something that isn't my fault.

09:48.505 --> 09:51.349
Ready- Okay.

09:51.424 --> 09:54.644
Could you please just go put her in
her car seat while I compose myself?

09:54.719 --> 09:58.064
Right. You know what, Cam? Why don't I just
take Lily to preschool on my way to work?

09:58.139 --> 10:01.609
I think that would be best. Let me just
whip up a smoothie for you before you go.

10:01.684 --> 10:04.528
I push the buttons, Daddy.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.024
You certainly do.

10:10.068 --> 10:11.991
What do you think the
principal's going to do to me?

10:12.112 --> 10:14.035
I am a first-time offender.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.242
Oh, great, now I'm tardy.
Strike two.

10:16.324 --> 10:18.247
Manny, think of this
in a positive way.

10:18.368 --> 10:20.712
Like it is your "ha-ha" moment.
What does that mean?

10:20.787 --> 10:22.915
That means that one day
you're gonna laugh about it.

10:22.997 --> 10:25.091
I should have just gave that
stupid necklace back to Alisha ...

10:25.166 --> 10:27.168
when she was standing
right next to her locker.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.300
This is the
worst day of my life.

10:29.379 --> 10:31.802
Till tomorrow,
and every day after that.

10:34.259 --> 10:35.977
Come on, Morn.
Let's just get this over with.

10:36.052 --> 10:37.929
Wait.

10:38.054 --> 10:40.773
What? Which one did you say
that it was her locker?

10:40.849 --> 10:44.399
- This one?
- Mm-hmm. The one that smells like rose oil.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.654
Mom?

10:47.730 --> 10:49.232
Keep the lookout.

10:52.193 --> 10:55.322
Now promise me that you will never
ever do anything dishonest again.

10:55.446 --> 10:58.791
I promise. Okay, because that's
not the way I raised you.

10:58.908 --> 11:01.081
Don't tell Jay anything, okay?
Mm-mmm.

11:01.202 --> 11:02.749
All right, Lily.
Hi, Lily.

11:02.829 --> 11:04.672
Hi.
Have fun, sweetheart.

11:04.747 --> 11:07.375
Bye.
She is so sweet.

11:07.458 --> 11:10.177
Oh, thanks. Well, you
should've seen her yesterday.

11:10.253 --> 11:12.506
Yeah. She pushed
a baby off of Cam's lap.

11:12.630 --> 11:14.382
Huh.
I know, I know.

11:14.465 --> 11:15.967
She is so possessive
of him.

11:16.050 --> 11:19.179
But, Cam's really working on trying
not to coddle her so much, so-

11:19.262 --> 11:22.357
Mm-hmm. I'm not really
sure it's about coddling.

11:22.432 --> 11:24.230
Sounds more like
a sharing issue.

11:24.309 --> 11:26.607
You know, we've noticed
Lily has a hard time with that.

11:26.728 --> 11:28.776
Really?
I wouldn't worry.

11:28.855 --> 11:31.358
Kids usually pick that habit up
from other kids.

11:31.441 --> 11:34.115
Except the ones who pick it up
from their parents.

11:34.194 --> 11:36.242
We have a few of those in here.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.039
Of course, I can't share
those names with you.

11:38.114 --> 11:40.458
Until I get a glass of wine in my hand.

11:40.533 --> 11:43.753
Oh. Oh, Miss Elaine.

11:43.828 --> 11:47.708
I have been told that I might have
the teensiest issue with sharing.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.215
But is that something
Lily would even pick up on?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.139
My chicken.

11:56.674 --> 11:58.597
My pillow.
Ow.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.596
Daddy's pen.
Crayons.

12:03.348 --> 12:07.694
Okay, it's possible, and I suppose for
Lily's sake, I-l should work on that.

12:08.895 --> 12:10.989
Yeah, privately.
Because right now,

12:11.064 --> 12:14.318
we really need to get Cam's
coddling problem under control.

12:17.237 --> 12:19.581
What's going on?
Moving into the attic.

12:19.656 --> 12:21.909
Give me a day or two to get
settled, and I'll have you up.

12:22.033 --> 12:25.003
When did all this happen?
Depends on who you ask.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.251
My plan's been in motion
for three weeks.

12:27.330 --> 12:30.584
Honey, this is a terrible idea.
You're gonna hate it up there.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.294
Morn, stay out of this.

12:32.377 --> 12:34.971
Yeah, we all have our own rooms now.
Everybody wins.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.140
Well, don't get too
comfortable in there, girls.

12:37.215 --> 12:39.968
Luke, it's cold
and it's scary up there.

12:40.051 --> 12:41.928
You're gonna be back in your
own room by tomorrow night.

12:42.011 --> 12:44.309
I don't know, Claire.
It's got a lot of potential.

12:44.389 --> 12:47.313
This is a lot nicer than the
attic I lived in when we met.

12:47.392 --> 12:49.986
One night, if that.
Trust me on this.

12:50.061 --> 12:52.439
Oh, yes, because
you are always right.

12:52.522 --> 12:54.695
Sweetheart,
I would love to be wrong.

12:54.774 --> 12:57.197
I just don't live with the
right people for that.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.780
Let it go, kids.
She's not gonna budge.

12:59.904 --> 13:03.124
Kept me up all night with-
Phil, you did push me!

13:03.199 --> 13:06.328
Your word against mine. Guess it's one
of those things we'll just never know.

13:06.411 --> 13:07.913
Like what really happened
to the Titanic.

13:07.996 --> 13:09.873
It hit an iceberg.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.295
Maybe.
Mmm, there's no maybe.

13:12.375 --> 13:13.592
Oh, you're right, Claire.

13:13.668 --> 13:16.888
- Again.
- Surprise, surprise.

13:16.963 --> 13:20.638
Okay, I will see you
over at Uncle Mitchell's.

13:20.717 --> 13:24.642
I'm going to skip this meeting
of the "pile on Claire club."

13:24.721 --> 13:26.223
Guess I pushed her
into that pile too.

13:35.106 --> 13:36.699
I spend half my life
waiting on you.

13:36.774 --> 13:38.822
How many times do you
have to change your outfit?

13:38.901 --> 13:41.370
Sorry, Jay. Too many
choices is a prison.

13:41.446 --> 13:43.619
Just drive before
he rethinks the pants.

13:43.740 --> 13:45.913
What's wrong with my pants?
Go, go, go.

13:48.745 --> 13:51.123
So Manny, how'd it go
with the principal today?

13:51.205 --> 13:54.505
It was terrible. But he was
brave, and now it's over.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.427
Right, Manny?
Mm-hmm.

13:56.544 --> 13:58.842
So- What'd they give you?
Detention? Suspension?

13:58.921 --> 14:01.424
No, just a warning,
because it was first offense.

14:01.549 --> 14:03.176
So how's work?
Great.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.933
Just a warning, huh?
Like she said.

14:06.012 --> 14:09.266
So I ask about work,
and you change the subject.

14:09.349 --> 14:10.851
Are you trying to hide
something?

14:10.933 --> 14:13.686
No. I just want to make sure he's okay.
You okay?

14:13.770 --> 14:16.068
'Cause, I mean, it looks like you're
sweatin' bullets back there, kid.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.866
Stop grilling him. First
the principal, now you.

14:18.941 --> 14:21.785
This poor boy is being
screamed at all day.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.035
Well, now-
Quiet! I've got this.

14:29.410 --> 14:31.162
Where is Lily?

14:31.287 --> 14:33.881
Um, she's getting dressed.
All by herself?

14:33.956 --> 14:36.880
Cam is encouraging her to
be more independent. Oh.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.802
And there she is!

14:38.878 --> 14:39.879
Ahh!

14:39.962 --> 14:41.509
Doesn't she look beautiful?

14:41.589 --> 14:43.341
Oh.
Mm-hmm.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.268
She looks like she was dipped in glue
and dragged through a ?ea market.

14:46.344 --> 14:47.846
Hey!

14:47.970 --> 14:49.563
Hey.  Hey, guys.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.856
How's it goin'?

14:50.932 --> 14:53.230
Hey, do you guys have
any old furniture?

14:53.351 --> 14:55.854
I'm moving into the attic.
The attic?

14:55.937 --> 14:57.564
Hey, at least it's big.

14:57.688 --> 15:00.532
Grandpa said you used to
live in a closet. Oh, okay.

15:00.608 --> 15:03.612
Well, you know what? Yeah, we'll absolutely
find you something for sure, okay?

15:03.694 --> 15:06.698
My daddy!
Lily, no!

15:06.781 --> 15:09.409
I'm sorry, Luke.
This isn't over.

15:09.492 --> 15:11.745
Oh, my God, Mitchell.
She's getting worse.

15:11.828 --> 15:15.082
I have turned her into a pushy
little entitled monster ...

15:15.164 --> 15:17.758
on her way to a rap sheet
and a bracelet on her ankle.

15:17.875 --> 15:20.924
Oh, she has a bracelet
on her ankle. Cam-

15:22.797 --> 15:25.892
Cam, this might not be entirely
your fault. No, it is.

15:26.008 --> 15:29.888
I spoke with Lily's teacher, and she thinks
that she may have a problem with sharing,

15:29.971 --> 15:32.144
which she might
have gotten from-

15:32.223 --> 15:33.816
You. You don't
like to share.

15:33.891 --> 15:35.564
No, I do it to
make a point sometimes.

15:35.643 --> 15:37.566
Like, if you want the chicken,
then order the chicken.

15:37.645 --> 15:39.318
Wait, when did you talk
to Lily's teacher?

15:39.397 --> 15:41.274
Uh, today when I- when I
dropped her off at school.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.030
And you let me suffer
all day?

15:43.109 --> 15:45.578
Look. W-We can't do this
with everybody here.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.405
Can we please just
get through the evening?

15:47.488 --> 15:49.081
Yes, but we are not making
the announcement tonight,

15:49.157 --> 15:52.957
because that is a joyful thing, and I
am not feeling very joyful right now.

15:53.035 --> 15:55.629
Well, I share your feeling.
l-

16:01.461 --> 16:03.304
Just so you know, I'm onto you.

16:03.379 --> 16:05.677
You never took Manny
to the principal.

16:07.341 --> 16:10.436
Okay, play it like that.
But I know Manny.

16:10.511 --> 16:13.481
He has more of a conscience
than you have.

16:13.556 --> 16:15.274
He's not gonna be able
to live with this.

16:17.351 --> 16:19.820
You'd be surprised what
people can live with, Jay.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.743
Hi, Miss Lily.

16:25.818 --> 16:27.991
How's my big girl doing?
Good.

16:28.070 --> 16:30.038
Can you tell me
how old you are now?

16:30.114 --> 16:31.866
Three!

16:31.949 --> 16:34.293
Well, that's four.
This is three.

16:34.368 --> 16:35.961
Okay, show me again.
How old are you?

16:36.037 --> 16:37.004
Three.

16:37.079 --> 16:40.959
No, that many is four.
This many is three.

16:41.083 --> 16:44.587
Don't argue, Lily. You'll never win.
Really, Phil?

16:44.670 --> 16:48.220
Okay, I-l was going to wait
until we got home for this.

16:48.299 --> 16:51.223
But now I think it's something
everyone's gonna enjoy. Guys-

16:51.302 --> 16:53.020
Everybody, come on down
to the TV room.

16:53.095 --> 16:55.814
I've got something
really special to share.

16:55.890 --> 16:57.642
Okay, how's everybody
on drinks?

16:57.725 --> 17:00.194
If this is Alex's graduation
again, just leave me the bottle.

17:00.269 --> 17:01.566
I'm good, Cam.

17:01.646 --> 17:06.277
Okay, everybody, showtime.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.281
Oh, my gosh.
it's us at the market.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.996
- Uh-huh. Yeah, it's security camera footage.
- How did you-

17:11.113 --> 17:13.787
I don't understand. What are we watching?
It ain't The Godfather.

17:13.866 --> 17:15.664
Okay, look.
I fell yesterday at the market.

17:15.742 --> 17:17.915
Phil and I have been having a little
disagreement as to what happened.

17:17.994 --> 17:19.291
Just watch.
Okay, right here.

17:19.372 --> 17:22.751
I stop to fix my shoe, and
then Phil- Right there. Okay.

17:22.833 --> 17:25.336
He makes way for this
very attractive woman,

17:25.419 --> 17:28.423
whom he conveniently leaves out
of his retelling of the story.

17:28.506 --> 17:33.808
Now, right here, Phil backs up, pushes his
butt into the cart, pushes me into the cans.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.514
Do you see that?
it's all his fault!

17:36.597 --> 17:39.601
Just like I said!
I was right! Suck it!

17:41.143 --> 17:42.816
When did you get this?
Oh, my God.

17:42.895 --> 17:45.068
That's why you wanted
to come separately.

17:45.147 --> 17:48.321
You went to all that trouble
just to prove you were right?

17:48.401 --> 17:50.119
It really wasn't
that much trouble.

17:50.194 --> 17:53.573
I went to the store, found your friend
Jordan, the bag boy, who got me the manager.

17:53.656 --> 17:56.125
He gave me the address of
the off-site security office.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.202
I filled out some paperwork.
Sally faxed it to corporate.

17:58.286 --> 18:02.166
Three minutes later, I'm buying a pack
of DVDs and burning a copy. Cake.

18:03.165 --> 18:05.384
It's like a sickness.

18:05.459 --> 18:08.087
What? None of you believed
me, so I got proof.

18:08.170 --> 18:09.843
You should all be sucking it
right now.

18:09.922 --> 18:13.142
Ay, please stop with the "sucking it," Claire.
They're children.

18:13.217 --> 18:15.766
Yes, children are very impressionable.
You'll never know what they'll pick up.

18:15.845 --> 18:18.769
Okay, Cam, I'm sorry that I
blamed it all on you, okay?

18:18.848 --> 18:20.521
But we both need to
look at our actions.

18:20.600 --> 18:23.820
I mean, if we're thinking about
adopting another baby, then we need to-

18:23.894 --> 18:27.649
- You're adopting another kid?
- That's not the way you make an announcement!

18:27.732 --> 18:30.485
- Banners! Banners!
- Thank you, but it's not a-

18:30.610 --> 18:33.284
# Ah, let's give the boy a hand #
Oh, wow.

18:33.362 --> 18:35.205
What the hell's
happening here?

18:35.281 --> 18:36.783
Is that from Footloose?

18:36.866 --> 18:38.960
- # Let's hear it for my babdy #
- Really, Mitchell?

18:39.076 --> 18:40.999
You couldn't even share telling
your family.

18:41.078 --> 18:45.549
- It's fine.
- Why are you upset? This is such good news.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.378
No, we're a little on edge because
Lily has been acting out,

18:48.461 --> 18:49.963
like she doesn't want
a sibling-

18:50.046 --> 18:52.390
Yeah, because Mitchell
taught her to hate sharing.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.810
And, or, because Cam wears her
like a fanny pack.

18:55.885 --> 18:58.388
Oh, stop blaming each other.
No kid wants a sibling.

18:58.471 --> 19:01.771
I mean, Claire hated you so much, she
stuck you in a dryer when you were two.

19:01.849 --> 19:03.226
You put me in the dryer?

19:03.309 --> 19:05.528
I did. But it wasn't
'cause I hated you.

19:05.603 --> 19:09.153
My friend Marcie said that it wouldn't run
with a kid inside it, and I knew it would.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.280
- I was right.
- Good governor.

19:12.360 --> 19:14.283
It's been going on
since you were five?

19:15.446 --> 19:17.869
Oh, my God, it is a sickness.
Yeah.

19:17.948 --> 19:21.919
What would make me have
that need at such a young age?

19:21.994 --> 19:23.496
How long was I in that dryer?
Because-

19:23.579 --> 19:25.252
I-Is this why I'm
afraid of tumbling?

19:25.331 --> 19:27.550
I had to quit gymnastics,
Claire!

19:27.625 --> 19:30.549
A childhood without tumbling?
Oh.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.256
You knew this, and just
stood by and did nothing?

19:33.339 --> 19:35.592
Okay, okay.
What's done is done.

19:35.675 --> 19:37.677
All you can do is
learn from your mistakes.

19:37.760 --> 19:42.561
And in that spirit, I would like
to propose a toast to Manny.

19:42.640 --> 19:46.019
This week, he did something he wasn't
supposed to do, like we all do-

19:46.102 --> 19:48.446
Like we all do!
Salud to Manny.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.773
Not yet.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.698
But Manny stood up
like a man.

19:51.774 --> 19:55.620
He admitted he was wrong, and he took his licks.
And I'm damn proud of him.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.915
- Ah, now we clink.
- No, we clink when I say we clink.

19:58.989 --> 20:02.334
So Manny made a mistake, but he
didn't take the easy way out.

20:02.410 --> 20:07.667
He's got guts. He's got integrity. And
as far as I'm concerned, he's the best-

20:07.748 --> 20:10.297
Okay, stop, stop!
I didn't do any of that!

20:10.418 --> 20:13.888
Mom broke into the locker and threw the necklace
inside, and then we ran away like cowards!

20:14.004 --> 20:15.802
I'm sorry, Jay! I'm sorry!
I knew it.

20:15.881 --> 20:17.975
I was right! I was right!

20:18.968 --> 20:20.766
Ohhhh.

20:20.845 --> 20:23.644
Okay. Yup.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.228
Who is it?

20:28.310 --> 20:29.778
Oh, hi, honey.
Just me.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.865
Are you okay?
Yeah. I'm great.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.658
So how are you liking
your new digs?

20:34.775 --> 20:37.244
I know you told me that
I'd be cold- Mm-hmm.

20:37.361 --> 20:39.329
And scared, but I'm not.
Mm-hmm.

20:39.405 --> 20:42.375
No, I can see that. I was wrong.

20:42.491 --> 20:43.617
You were.
Yeah.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.499
Well, you're gonna hate this
then, honey,

20:45.578 --> 20:48.582
but I'm gonna need you to go back down
and sleep in your old room.

20:48.664 --> 20:50.837
I just- I'm worried
if you get something so cool ...

20:50.916 --> 20:52.168
this early in your life,

20:52.251 --> 20:54.595
you're not gonna have anything
to look forward to later.

20:54.670 --> 20:56.718
I have to go now?

20:56.839 --> 20:59.592
You can spend the rest of the
night here, if you want. Oh, no.

20:59.675 --> 21:02.975
If it's so important to you,
I'll go now.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.816
You should come too.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.393
Something sleeps over there.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.907
Wait for me. Wait.
Wait for me. Wait for me.
