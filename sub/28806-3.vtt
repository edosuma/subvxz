01:29.380 --> 01:30.757
<i>I just want a name.</i>

01:31.508 --> 01:32.509
Whose name?

01:33.968 --> 01:36.054
- Brandt?
- His full name.

01:39.349 --> 01:41.392
- Andrew Brandt.
- Thanks.

01:59.452 --> 02:02.122
<i>You get used to it pretty quick.</i>

02:02.664 --> 02:03.873
<i>The strength.</i>

02:06.417 --> 02:09.711
<i>One day, you're a scrawny kid
getting Ds in PE...</i>

02:12.298 --> 02:14.801
<i>the next day, you can toss a minivan.</i>

02:16.594 --> 02:19.139
<i>Eventually, it's just a part
of who you are.</i>

02:22.183 --> 02:23.977
<i>The part that no one can take away.</i>

02:54.716 --> 02:57.844
Every day,
every minute of every day,

02:57.927 --> 03:01.306
the human body is exposed
to countless microorganisms

03:01.389 --> 03:04.058
that could end our fragile function.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.603
Well, that tracks.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.521
It's New York City.

03:08.605 --> 03:09.689
The spleen.

03:09.772 --> 03:13.943
The glorious, often overlooked,
but never overwhelmed, spleen

03:14.027 --> 03:15.945
protects us from all of them.

03:16.529 --> 03:19.073
So I'm guessing not having one...

03:19.616 --> 03:21.242
it's kind of a negative.

03:21.326 --> 03:23.703
That's what I'm trying
to ex-spleen to you.

03:27.916 --> 03:30.668
After a splenectomy,
normal life can resume,

03:30.752 --> 03:35.840
provided one takes precaution against
an increased risk of deadly infections.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.467
I'll start taking a multivitamin.

03:37.550 --> 03:42.805
A rigorous immunization schedule,
prophylactic antibiotic regimen,

03:42.889 --> 03:46.851
and, of course, a swift change
in any reckless lifestyle behavior.

03:46.935 --> 03:52.065
And where would a liter a day of bourbon
fall on the reckless scale?

03:52.148 --> 03:54.317
You'll be with us
for a few days.

03:54.400 --> 03:58.238
But we should apprise your home care team
of your needs upon release.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.115
There's no one at home who cares.
I'll handle my own needs.

04:01.199 --> 04:06.496
Ms. Jones, if you were a standard human,
those injuries would've been fatal.

04:08.122 --> 04:10.250
Well, I'm still alive, so discharge me.

04:10.333 --> 04:13.544
You may be special,
but you're not completely invulnerable.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.380
I have to be. That's the job.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.966
There's somebody I have to find.

04:18.048 --> 04:21.678
Whoa, whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Wait a minute. You're a fall risk.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.596
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:25.473 --> 04:27.809
Fall back. There you go.

04:44.659 --> 04:46.286
Get your ass back to bed.

04:46.369 --> 04:49.372
You know I can't face the E train
until you make me come.

04:51.124 --> 04:53.710
Too bad you have such trouble
asking for what you want.

04:55.795 --> 04:58.715
- Is that blood?
- It's... It's not a big deal.

04:58.798 --> 05:02.343
See, but I don't typically piss blood,
so I think it's a very big deal.

05:02.427 --> 05:03.970
Babe, what happened?

05:04.887 --> 05:06.180
It was just a cabbie last night.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.558
He was riding tail after tail.
He was bound to hit one.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.935
Oh, did you get it checked out?

05:11.019 --> 05:12.353
I looked it up.

05:12.437 --> 05:14.772
It's just some internal bruising.
It'll pass.

05:14.856 --> 05:18.359
Yeah, because self-diagnosis
is always a good idea.

05:19.152 --> 05:20.236
We're gonna sue.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.989
No, we are not.

05:23.072 --> 05:25.616
If these assholes want to compete
with ride-sharing platforms,

05:25.700 --> 05:28.578
they'd better start approximating
some actual skill behind the wheel.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.497
- Did you get his medallion number?
- Babe...

05:32.123 --> 05:34.917
you are off the clock.
Please, just let it go.

05:35.001 --> 05:38.671
Uh-uh. Someone injured
this beautiful specimen of a man.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.965
And you mess with what's mine,
I come for you.

05:41.049 --> 05:43.676
I love you, too,
and you gotta get your ass to the office.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.555
- Not you?
- I'm, uh, working from home today.

05:53.561 --> 05:54.896
Are you okay, love?

05:57.231 --> 05:58.441
I...

06:01.402 --> 06:02.779
It's just Hogarth.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.366
I work for her, too.
I know what she's like.

06:06.449 --> 06:07.533
You don't know everything.

06:07.617 --> 06:09.702
I know I have
the job of my dreams.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.747
I'm not sure you'd say the same.

06:14.832 --> 06:16.584
Hey, it doesn't matter.

06:16.667 --> 06:18.503
One more year,
I'll have the cash, the clout.

06:18.586 --> 06:19.837
I can go out on my own.

06:21.255 --> 06:23.091
Is that a justification?

06:23.174 --> 06:24.467
It's a plan,

06:25.218 --> 06:27.095
'cause you deserve a man who has one.

06:34.477 --> 06:36.020
The E train is waiting.

06:36.938 --> 06:39.690
So am I.

06:56.916 --> 06:58.334
Damn it, Jones.

07:00.795 --> 07:01.838
Costa?

07:03.589 --> 07:05.967
I already told them no more visitors.

07:06.050 --> 07:07.468
You see flowers under my arm?

07:07.552 --> 07:09.429
I'm here to take a statement about a case.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.307
The attempted homicide of Jessica Jones.

07:13.391 --> 07:17.061
I'm betting you have a guess
as to who did this. I need one, too.

07:18.146 --> 07:19.272
What have you got?

07:20.440 --> 07:21.566
Are we sharing?

07:22.358 --> 07:23.818
- The knife?
- No.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.069
So nothing.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.738
Which is why I had your assistant
pull up your client list.

07:28.531 --> 07:31.909
You could save me some effort
by telling me which one you pissed off.

07:31.993 --> 07:32.994
Tough call.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.079
Look, Jones, I respect you.

07:35.163 --> 07:37.707
Mostly. Your better qualities
deserve to be respected.

07:37.790 --> 07:39.333
What is that, some kind of flattery?

07:39.417 --> 07:41.669
I'm not gonna waste our time
with this dance.

07:41.752 --> 07:46.215
You'll do what you'll do,
but you're not used to being the victim.

07:48.259 --> 07:51.637
My name on your case file
does not make me a victim.

07:51.721 --> 07:53.306
Those staples in your belly do.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.893
And that guy's still out there
until one of us finds him.

08:00.813 --> 08:02.732
Don't make yourself an easy target.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.711
The, uh, kale Caesar is quite filling.

08:24.754 --> 08:26.672
Talk about faint praise.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.550
Ladies, can I bring you
something to drink?

08:29.634 --> 08:30.885
Iced tea, no lemon.

08:30.968 --> 08:34.429
Ignore my friend's false virtue
and bring us two glasses of dry red.

08:34.514 --> 08:37.683
Cab franc, if you have it,
and otherwise, your choice.

08:40.811 --> 08:45.816
The last time I saw you, I cried so hard
my eyes were swollen for three days.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.694
And the time before that,
your head was between my legs.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.197
We need all the wine.

08:51.781 --> 08:52.781
I'm glad you came.

08:52.823 --> 08:56.577
Well, I couldn't resist an hour
of navel-gazing with the one who got away.

08:58.496 --> 09:01.332
Speaking of, what ever happened to Wendy?

09:01.916 --> 09:03.167
I married her.

09:04.961 --> 09:05.961
How did that go?

09:06.003 --> 09:08.881
Are you asking if I cheated on Wendy?

09:10.841 --> 09:11.968
Yeah, I cheated.

09:12.802 --> 09:16.264
With what can only be described
as unabashed verve.

09:16.347 --> 09:19.183
Well, at least I wasn't the only one.
We should start a club.

09:23.521 --> 09:25.898
Wendy, uh... she died.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.776
It was a tragic accident.

09:28.859 --> 09:30.903
So I guess it all finally caught up to me.

09:30.987 --> 09:34.615
I'm sorry. Are you implying
that you're the injured party

09:34.699 --> 09:36.367
in your wife's untimely death?

09:36.450 --> 09:39.579
Are you still mad at me?
It's been 25 years.

09:39.662 --> 09:42.540
I'm still deciding.
Just tell me what we're doing here.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.379
I wanted to connect
and to reminisce.

09:48.462 --> 09:52.341
Bullshit.
Jeri Hogarth doesn't do nostalgia.

09:53.926 --> 09:55.636
I wanted to see if you were happy.

09:57.430 --> 10:00.891
If what I did to you broke you
the way that it broke Wendy.

10:04.520 --> 10:08.232
Well, to therapy. Hmm. I'm not broken.

10:09.900 --> 10:12.236
How long have you and Peter been married?

10:12.320 --> 10:14.113
A year after you dumped me.

10:14.697 --> 10:18.659
Started as a rebound,
turned into 23 years and a family.

10:21.370 --> 10:23.539
I'm so sorry about your daughter.

10:24.999 --> 10:26.000
Yeah.

10:27.251 --> 10:29.920
Cancer. Bullshit.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.508
See? All of the wine.

10:36.969 --> 10:40.556
Your music. Tell me about it.
I want to hear.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.768
I stopped playing for a while
after Zoey.

10:43.851 --> 10:46.687
Music felt... empty.

10:48.189 --> 10:49.982
Not that the masses were clamoring.

10:50.066 --> 10:53.152
- You never joined an orchestra?
- I wasn't good enough.

10:53.235 --> 10:56.864
You were better than good.

10:58.366 --> 11:01.118
I'm sure that teaching has its rewards.

11:01.202 --> 11:04.747
Oh, please. You try impressing
the importance of Baroque fugue analysis

11:04.830 --> 11:06.374
on a room full of millennials.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.175
I remember us.

11:17.218 --> 11:18.552
Well, how I used to be.

11:19.679 --> 11:20.888
A lot's changed.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.934
I remember a singular talent.

11:26.936 --> 11:32.066
I remember a brilliant, baffling girl
who showed me the world.

11:37.321 --> 11:39.365
You took my goddamn breath away.

11:44.286 --> 11:47.707
I still have a tape of that piece
that you composed for me.

11:51.627 --> 11:53.713
- No, you don't.
- I can prove it.

11:56.590 --> 12:02.346
You know, um, I have a class at 3:00.
And I already ate lunch.

12:02.930 --> 12:05.307
You... you ate lunch?

12:06.434 --> 12:07.727
But I enjoyed the wine.

12:07.810 --> 12:09.228
Well, then the wine is on me.

12:12.106 --> 12:13.566
It was good to see you, Jeri.

12:13.649 --> 12:15.568
And brief. Yet again.

12:23.117 --> 12:25.077
And you don't really have that tape.

12:38.549 --> 12:39.967
This states you understand

12:40.050 --> 12:42.678
you've been discharged
against medical advice,

12:42.762 --> 12:45.222
thereby releasing the hospital
of responsibility.

12:54.607 --> 12:56.025
Take care of yourself.

13:01.864 --> 13:04.408
<i>A hero is strong.</i>

13:07.703 --> 13:09.538
<i>A hero is invulnerable.</i>

13:16.086 --> 13:19.089
<i>A hero has a goddamn spleen.</i>

13:36.190 --> 13:39.360
Welcome home. Detective Costa
suggested we heighten security

13:39.443 --> 13:41.320
until the threat against you
is apprehended.

13:43.781 --> 13:45.282
I can take care of myself.

13:45.366 --> 13:48.869
I can't. And I'm not taking
a knife for what you pay me.

13:51.497 --> 13:54.416
I need you to find out everything you can
on Andrew Brandt.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.711
Remind me tomorrow? It's 4:56.

13:57.795 --> 14:00.089
There's a Jim Shaw exhibition
opening at MoMA,

14:00.172 --> 14:01.715
and I need at least two martinis

14:01.799 --> 14:04.426
before making small talk
about acrylic on muslin.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.011
What the hell is this?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.180
That little troll brought it by.

14:08.264 --> 14:09.265
Vido?

14:09.348 --> 14:10.724
He said it was a new spleen.

14:10.808 --> 14:14.395
Sweet kid, but he sure didn't inherit
his father's talent.

14:14.478 --> 14:16.397
I spoke to your doctor. Chatty.

14:16.480 --> 14:19.859
Scheduled your post-surgical vaccinations
for a week from Tuesday.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.486
Uh, antibiotic, twice a day.

14:23.028 --> 14:26.657
The coveted opioid,
every four to six hours, as needed.

14:26.740 --> 14:29.493
And a laxative,
for the resulting constipation.

14:29.577 --> 14:31.662
- Shit.
- If you're lucky. Are we good?

14:33.247 --> 14:34.582
Sure.

14:35.624 --> 14:36.625
Give me your phone.

14:39.503 --> 14:45.009
Alarm. It'll remind you to take them,
starting now.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.177
One of each.

14:51.056 --> 14:53.392
You're supposed to take them with water.

15:15.456 --> 15:16.749
Lock it behind me.

15:53.994 --> 15:55.204
Mmm!

16:02.378 --> 16:04.964
<i>Lose an organ, gain a case.</i>

16:09.218 --> 16:12.596
<i>A victim is vulnerable, weak.</i>

16:13.931 --> 16:16.266
<i>And that's just the way Brandt wants them.</i>

16:17.601 --> 16:18.602
<i>Wants us.</i>

16:39.456 --> 16:41.083
<i>But to hell with vulnerable.</i>

16:43.085 --> 16:45.504
<i>Strength is a part of me.</i>

16:46.755 --> 16:49.008
<i>And no one is gonna take it away.</i>

17:25.669 --> 17:26.712
Who is it?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.338
It's me.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.808
Were you asleep? Early for you.

17:40.768 --> 17:41.769
Thanks...

17:43.103 --> 17:44.354
for the ambulance.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.318
I grabbed it before the cops got here.

17:50.277 --> 17:53.697
Meaning you illegally tampered
with police evidence.

17:56.408 --> 17:58.577
Jeri's taught you all sorts of tricks.

17:58.660 --> 18:00.621
I knew you'd want to handle this yourself.

18:00.704 --> 18:04.041
It's clean.
I called in a favor, ran it for prints.

18:04.124 --> 18:06.684
It's a six-inch chef's knife,
part of a set from a popular brand.

18:06.710 --> 18:08.962
- Too common to trace.
- So he's smart.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.547
What'll you do when you find him?

18:13.050 --> 18:15.886
Whatever it takes.
And I don't need favors.

18:15.969 --> 18:17.513
I figured you'd say that.

18:21.433 --> 18:23.393
- A bill?
- For the time I put in.

18:23.477 --> 18:26.980
And how much time did you spend
chasing this non-lead?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.649
Fee's gone up.

19:51.064 --> 19:52.274
I'm impressed.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.820
I've been searching the place for hours,
you walk in, have a lead in ten minutes.

19:57.404 --> 19:59.656
- It's called experience.
- I said I was impressed.

20:02.034 --> 20:06.163
Brandt was my target first.
I should be the one to bring him in.

20:06.246 --> 20:09.458
Well, I was the one
with a post-surgical drain in my gut,

20:09.541 --> 20:11.793
so I'm gonna have to disagree.

20:11.877 --> 20:12.878
I get it.

20:14.046 --> 20:16.506
You don't want my help or my friendship.

20:16.590 --> 20:19.343
I've moved on, too. Found a purpose.

20:19.426 --> 20:23.055
At the very least, I didn't think
you'd want to take that away from me.

20:23.138 --> 20:24.514
I don't want anything from you.

20:25.098 --> 20:29.895
So you can ride this '90s parkour crap
back into the fame you crave.

20:29.978 --> 20:31.438
All I want is Brandt

20:31.521 --> 20:33.732
and every other asshole like him
behind bars.

20:33.815 --> 20:35.418
Should you even be out of bed?

20:35.442 --> 20:38.362
The liver and the lymph nodes
can do everything a spleen can do.

20:38.445 --> 20:41.657
It's basically... a redundant organ.

20:42.407 --> 20:45.786
Look, you just take care of yourself.
I'll take care of him.

20:45.869 --> 20:46.912
You're the victim here.

20:46.995 --> 20:50.123
I'm not a victim... if I stop him.

20:51.500 --> 20:53.752
Do you even know if Brandt is your guy?

20:54.461 --> 20:56.463
Will you even ask if you find him?

20:56.546 --> 20:58.423
- It's not your concern.
- The hell it's not.

20:58.507 --> 21:01.885
Before you screwed it up,
my plan was to deliver Brandt to the cops.

21:03.428 --> 21:05.430
I doubt you have the same agenda.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.938
Vengeance, not justice?
That's not what a hero does.

21:13.021 --> 21:17.401
You've been a hero for five minutes.
I've been one half my life.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.902
You've been super, Jess.

21:19.903 --> 21:21.613
There's a difference.

21:31.623 --> 21:34.710
This is good. Yeah, great work.

21:34.793 --> 21:37.462
Make those changes
and file it with the court.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.089
- Well done.
- Thanks.

21:46.471 --> 21:48.071
You said you had a job for me.

21:48.140 --> 21:51.059
I typically loathe
the term "power couple."

21:51.143 --> 21:53.729
It suggests a lack of autonomy
from both partners

21:53.812 --> 21:55.647
simply because they share a bed.

21:57.024 --> 21:58.025
I'm sorry. I, uh...

21:58.108 --> 22:00.402
For Chrissake, I don't...
I don't give a shit.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.487
As long as you both sign a consent form.

22:03.655 --> 22:04.656
Done.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.450
And your assignments,
they stay between us.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.118
Absolutely. Chinese wall.

22:08.702 --> 22:13.623
Bigger men have been taken down
by workplace dalliances, Malcolm.

22:14.708 --> 22:17.669
Well, this is, uh... It's more than that.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.421
Like, a lot more.

22:20.714 --> 22:21.714
Okay.

22:22.799 --> 22:24.718
I, uh I need a workup on this.

22:27.721 --> 22:30.515
- Law school professor.
- Potential business associate.

22:32.893 --> 22:34.519
Is there anything I should know?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.022
Just tell me what he's hiding.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.607
I'm on it.

22:44.404 --> 22:48.200
Hi. I'm a collector
of Victor Cataldo's artwork.

22:48.283 --> 22:53.914
I am wondering about an upcoming auction
you have of <i>A Curious Man in Winter.</i>

22:53.997 --> 22:57.542
<i>There are no Cataldo works
on the legitimate market.</i>

22:57.626 --> 22:59.336
I was referred by Jeryn Hogarth,

22:59.419 --> 23:02.255
who mentioned a confidential auction
featuring a Cataldo.

23:02.339 --> 23:04.800
<i>Obviously,
we don't deal in illicit trade.</i>

23:04.883 --> 23:08.387
Hi, this is Mallory calling
from Jeryn Hogarth's office.

23:08.470 --> 23:12.724
One of our clients is interested
in a disputed collectible.

23:12.808 --> 23:17.312
<i>We don't entertain intermediaries
when discussing privileged lots.</i>

24:41.646 --> 24:43.440
Office hours are 2:00 to 4:00.

24:44.816 --> 24:47.027
But I, uh, I got a minute. Come on inside.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.158
What's your name?

24:53.742 --> 24:54.993
Darryl Hughes.

24:55.076 --> 25:00.624
Huh, you know, I take a bizarre pride in
having committed my full roster to memory.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.709
No Darryls on that list. Have a seat.

25:03.919 --> 25:06.379
Uh...
I'm not actually in the department.

25:06.463 --> 25:10.217
I was hoping to transfer
into your Legal Ethics seminar.

25:10.300 --> 25:12.427
Huh. What are you studying now?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.471
I'm in the master's biology program.

25:15.222 --> 25:18.141
Pre-med. So what's the draw of my course?

25:20.060 --> 25:22.687
The discussion of morality... in the law.

25:22.771 --> 25:24.648
I... I come from a religious background.

25:24.731 --> 25:27.275
Same here. Lapsed Catholic.

25:27.359 --> 25:31.363
I'm coming to terms with the idea
that... righteousness,

25:31.446 --> 25:33.865
at least the kind
that they taught us is...

25:35.116 --> 25:36.660
is never absolute.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.373
Darryl, welcome
to the pliable ethics of adulthood.

25:41.957 --> 25:44.459
I can tell you,
it only gets more confusing from here.

25:44.543 --> 25:45.543
Huh.

25:45.961 --> 25:48.713
Look, I'm afraid I don't have any chairs
left for nonmajors.

25:48.797 --> 25:51.174
But you should check in with me
next semester.

25:51.258 --> 25:53.843
- Yeah, I will.
- Good luck to you.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.171
Didn't want to knock,

26:30.255 --> 26:33.383
given your track record
with surprise visitors.

26:34.926 --> 26:36.177
What are you doing here?

26:36.261 --> 26:38.722
Somebody gets stabbed
in the middle of a hookup,

26:38.805 --> 26:41.099
the traditional response
is to check up on her.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.976
You don't strike me as traditional.

26:43.059 --> 26:45.312
Just like that,
she caught me giving a shit.

26:49.691 --> 26:51.610
I have no spleen.

26:51.693 --> 26:55.030
Drag. What the hell does a spleen even do?

26:55.113 --> 26:56.281
That's what I said.

26:58.283 --> 27:01.244
Do you know who the guy was?
Why he was after you?

27:02.078 --> 27:03.747
It's what I do.

27:05.832 --> 27:08.793
If you find him,
how are you gonna handle him?

27:08.877 --> 27:10.003
When I find him.

27:10.712 --> 27:13.506
Like I said, it's what I do.

27:15.091 --> 27:16.092
Got it.

27:17.761 --> 27:21.097
I just want to know if you tried it.
I got 50 bucks riding on this.

27:22.349 --> 27:23.475
The burger.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.810
Eh, tossed it.

27:26.436 --> 27:29.773
The doctor said I needed to make
some, uh, lifestyle changes.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.276
And the guy you met
over a massive amount of booze

27:33.360 --> 27:35.612
isn't the post-op company
you're looking for.

27:36.696 --> 27:38.657
- Not tonight.
- Cool.

27:40.575 --> 27:41.826
Have a nice life.

27:44.162 --> 27:45.538
Hope you find a donor.

27:53.296 --> 27:54.923
I understand, Serena.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.885
As women, we tend to give
more than we get.

27:59.552 --> 28:02.514
But, you know,
that moment at the end of the day

28:02.597 --> 28:06.851
when I pull off my bra and put on
a pot of Cozy Chamomile Tea,

28:06.935 --> 28:12.065
available right here on ARN
during our Herbal Remedies Hour of Power,

28:12.816 --> 28:14.484
and I sink into the sofa...

28:15.193 --> 28:17.904
That moment... that's mine.

28:17.987 --> 28:21.658
And there is nothing
I would rather wrap myself up in

28:21.741 --> 28:23.868
than our signature cozy merino wool

28:23.952 --> 28:27.580
like this beautiful
rib-knit long cardigan.

28:27.664 --> 28:29.332
- So soft.
- Hold the phone.

28:29.416 --> 28:32.460
I've just been informed
that our sweater vest

28:32.544 --> 28:36.339
has sold 140,000 units!

28:36.423 --> 28:37.757
Yay!

28:37.841 --> 28:40.176
You've set a network record,
outpacing Tucker Price

28:40.260 --> 28:43.638
and his multifunction
countertop rotisserie oven.

28:43.722 --> 28:45.724
You guys, thank you.

28:45.807 --> 28:47.767
I'm telling you, girl,
this is just the beginning.

28:47.809 --> 28:49.352
You were born for this.

28:55.108 --> 28:56.109
Thank you.

29:13.668 --> 29:17.547
It's 12:29. I'm taking lunch.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.133
And there's a client
waiting in the office.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.720
Should I tell her you've recently been
the victim of a violent crime

29:23.803 --> 29:25.430
and are currently indisposed?

29:27.140 --> 29:29.184
Enjoy your microgreens.

29:46.034 --> 29:49.746
I wasn't aware I'd hired a new assistant.
Mallory?

29:52.665 --> 29:55.543
Well, I'd apologize,
but it won't be the last time

29:55.627 --> 29:57.837
that I use your name
without your permission.

29:58.671 --> 30:01.299
Malcolm told me what happened. I...

30:02.175 --> 30:05.178
- want to check on you.
- Why? So we can be invalids together?

30:08.723 --> 30:10.475
Sorry, I'm a dick.

30:12.936 --> 30:17.148
Every day, I take a glutamate blocker,
then a muscle relaxant.

30:17.232 --> 30:20.235
I take something
for the excess saliva in my mouth.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.112
Take an Ativan
for the panic of impending death

30:23.196 --> 30:26.282
and a stool softener, so I manage
a movement every three days.

30:27.408 --> 30:28.868
I see you're on one, too.

30:29.869 --> 30:32.580
In spite of being
fundamentally vulnerable and alone,

30:32.664 --> 30:36.417
I get out of bed, I go to work and I win.

30:36.501 --> 30:41.089
Little hard to swallow a pep talk
from a woman who begged me to snuff her.

30:41.172 --> 30:46.845
I've... decided to focus on the journey
rather than the inevitable end.

30:46.928 --> 30:48.137
You get that off a pamphlet?

30:52.100 --> 30:55.812
You know... they're developing
new trials all the time.

30:55.895 --> 30:59.983
There's one out of Israel
that... is looking good.

31:00.066 --> 31:01.066
Hmm.

31:02.443 --> 31:03.987
You've been doing some research.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.907
Me, too. And I will continue to.

31:08.867 --> 31:12.245
But I want to make sure that
my health status remains confidential.

31:13.913 --> 31:14.913
Thank you.

31:15.999 --> 31:20.253
Now, what makes you think that I know
anything about illegal art sales?

31:21.713 --> 31:22.713
Don't you?

31:24.173 --> 31:25.800
I'll make some calls.

31:26.634 --> 31:27.844
In the meantime,

31:27.927 --> 31:32.432
my actual assistant will send you
some names of galleries for you to survey.

31:32.515 --> 31:36.102
Us invalids, we need to stick together.

31:45.403 --> 31:46.613
Well, that was fast.

32:08.259 --> 32:10.637
Hey, uh,
what's the cheapest thing you got?

32:10.720 --> 32:11.804
Hot pretzel.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.016
What's the cheapest thing you got
that doesn't taste like salted cardboard?

32:15.099 --> 32:16.684
Hot dog coming right up.

32:50.760 --> 32:53.179
- You have something I want.
- Whatever.

33:21.791 --> 33:22.792
Jess?

33:24.460 --> 33:27.130
Jess, come on. Jess, wake up.

33:32.135 --> 33:33.720
<i>911. What is your emergency?</i>

33:33.803 --> 33:36.848
Hi. Yeah, there's a woman passed out
on the corner of 49th and 10th.

33:36.931 --> 33:37.974
<i>Alright, stay calm.</i>

33:38.057 --> 33:40.435
Yeah, tell the responders
that she has no spleen.

33:40.518 --> 33:41.519
<i>Is she breathing?</i>

33:48.401 --> 33:50.153
Oh, is she okay?

33:50.236 --> 33:52.780
- Uh, I'm gonna go flag down the ambulance.
- Okay.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.782
What's happening over there?

33:55.324 --> 33:57.204
- Ma'am?
- You guys need any help?

33:57.493 --> 33:58.619
Is she all right?

34:00.705 --> 34:02.290
You're relentless.

34:02.373 --> 34:04.959
- I told you I kept the tape.
- I'm only here to call your bluff.

34:08.963 --> 34:12.300
"Sonata in A Minor for Jeryn."
Catchy title.

34:12.382 --> 34:16.012
I composed it when I was 21.
I can't be held responsible.

34:16.804 --> 34:19.389
This worries me, truly.
I mean, what else did you save?

34:20.224 --> 34:21.641
Only what was important.

34:25.897 --> 34:27.982
I just came from a lesson uptown.

34:28.065 --> 34:29.442
You want me to take it for you?

34:29.525 --> 34:32.527
No. It's a repro of a Strad Braga.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.739
I won't even let Peter put it
in the trunk of a cab.

34:36.532 --> 34:37.532
Wow.

34:38.868 --> 34:40.119
You live here.

34:41.746 --> 34:45.166
There's not one thing
that says analog about this place.

34:45.248 --> 34:47.918
How are you planning
on playing that cassette?

34:48.835 --> 34:51.797
You forget that I graduated law school
in the '90s.

34:51.880 --> 34:55.134
Evidence of a hoarding tendency
is only mounting.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.136
Do you remember when we recorded that?

34:58.179 --> 35:00.056
We were in bed. It was late.

35:00.139 --> 35:02.683
But we never really slept
when we were together.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.187
You said you had something for me.

35:08.106 --> 35:14.529
And you crawled out from under
that ratty, down alternative blanket...

35:16.405 --> 35:19.283
- Wow.
- ...and you pulled up a chair.

35:20.701 --> 35:22.745
I had to remind myself to breathe.

35:24.413 --> 35:27.291
When you put that cello
between your naked legs...

35:28.626 --> 35:32.338
I don't think
I have ever been more in love

35:33.172 --> 35:35.091
than I was in that moment.

35:43.558 --> 35:44.642
Oh, shit.

35:49.897 --> 35:53.442
You had heady plans for that big moment,
didn't you?

35:56.612 --> 35:57.864
Was it working?

36:02.118 --> 36:04.370
You know, I still remember that piece.

36:07.373 --> 36:08.749
I looked better then...

36:09.792 --> 36:10.960
but I sound better now.

38:23.801 --> 38:24.969
Mmm.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.955
I'm starving. Chinese or Thai?

39:39.168 --> 39:40.378
Babe, you hungry?

39:43.756 --> 39:45.466
That was startling.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.093
Startled the hell out of me, too.

39:47.176 --> 39:50.221
I've got two hours left
on this brief. You're watching porn.

39:50.805 --> 39:53.099
- It's... It's not porn.
- No judgment.

39:53.182 --> 39:55.684
If this is how you deal with stress,
it's fine.

39:56.977 --> 40:00.189
I'd just prefer you watch it with me.

40:04.652 --> 40:06.779
Who needs that
when you got the real thing?

40:27.383 --> 40:28.801
Christ, you feel good.

40:46.819 --> 40:47.903
Ms. Jones.

40:47.987 --> 40:50.072
Oh, shit.

40:50.156 --> 40:53.367
You lost consciousness
due to severe dehydration.

40:53.993 --> 40:55.744
When you said a liter of bourbon...

40:55.828 --> 40:59.290
I need my things, my phone.

41:00.166 --> 41:02.835
I don't think
you've totally grasped your situation.

41:03.377 --> 41:05.713
Your body has spleen better days.

41:07.006 --> 41:10.468
Your immune system
is immeasurably more vulnerable.

41:10.551 --> 41:13.179
It can't take the abuse
it once did.

41:13.721 --> 41:14.921
We're keeping you overnight...

41:14.972 --> 41:17.391
<i>...is immeasurably more vulnerable.</i>

41:22.188 --> 41:24.815
Jessica? Jessica, are you all right?

41:30.404 --> 41:32.740
I'll stay.

41:37.203 --> 41:39.079
You're the only person I've ever met

41:39.163 --> 41:42.458
that has gotten every single thing
she ever wanted.

41:43.667 --> 41:45.002
Is that what you see?

41:46.378 --> 41:47.880
You have your own law firm.

41:49.215 --> 41:52.092
Respect and accolades from your peers.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.888
You live in a glass palace.

41:58.140 --> 42:01.352
No one gets to this point in life
without regrets.

42:05.105 --> 42:06.106
It's late.

42:14.573 --> 42:15.991
What are you gonna tell him?

42:16.575 --> 42:17.576
The truth.

42:19.787 --> 42:23.290
So I should expect an angry husband
at my door.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.126
Oh, no need.
Peter and I have an open marriage.

42:28.963 --> 42:29.964
What does that mean?

42:30.589 --> 42:32.967
It means I'm screwing you.

42:33.050 --> 42:36.178
He's probably screwing
some graduate student as we speak.

42:38.847 --> 42:41.058
When Zoey died...

42:43.435 --> 42:46.272
we gave each other our own sanity.

42:46.355 --> 42:51.193
Marriage is long... and, I mean,
we'll never leave each other.

42:54.738 --> 42:55.906
That's something.

42:56.699 --> 42:59.577
So don't worry. I won't get attached.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.328
Talk soon.

44:04.183 --> 44:06.977
<i>A hero knows the value
of a good narcotic.</i>

45:25.597 --> 45:28.142
<i>Some people just have
too much goddamn money.</i>

45:28.225 --> 45:30.310
...incredible
contemporary collection.

45:30.394 --> 45:32.813
Yes. Let me show you what we have.

45:32.896 --> 45:36.275
Well, I can't wait to see.
I've only just started collecting.

45:36.358 --> 45:38.569
There's always time
to develop an appreciation

45:38.652 --> 45:40.529
for what I call "captive beauty."

45:40.612 --> 45:41.739
Oh, I love that.

45:41.822 --> 45:44.199
But I've been through
three art consultants already.

45:44.283 --> 45:46.827
- Damn it, Trish.
- They just... They didn't get me.

45:47.411 --> 45:49.955
It's a developing aesthetic,
but it's mine, you know?

45:50.038 --> 45:52.499
Absolutely. It's about listening.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.810
- Interpreting.
- Right.

45:53.834 --> 45:55.043
Expanding.

45:55.127 --> 45:57.045
Can I offer you a glass of champagne?

45:57.129 --> 45:58.630
Oh, that's all right. I don't, um...

46:01.383 --> 46:04.136
Uh, actually, that would be lovely.
Thank you.

46:31.830 --> 46:34.041
I opened a special bottle.

46:34.583 --> 46:37.169
You let me know if it's
not chilled to your liking.

46:37.920 --> 46:39.171
Thank you.

46:40.005 --> 46:43.592
- I really like this one.
- Oh, he's very, very talented.

46:52.142 --> 46:53.143
Hey.

46:58.941 --> 47:02.820
Not bad if you're into the cultural
representation of male pathos.

47:02.903 --> 47:04.279
You found it.

47:04.363 --> 47:06.073
You found Brandt's contact info.

47:06.156 --> 47:07.324
I'm going after him.

47:08.033 --> 47:10.285
Jesus. Are we really doing
this shit again?

47:10.369 --> 47:13.163
Oh, you look like death.
Just give me the sculpture.

47:13.247 --> 47:14.373
Just give me the phone.

47:14.456 --> 47:17.125
I know this goes against
your entire sense of self.

47:17.751 --> 47:20.337
That you can be weak and I can be strong.

47:20.420 --> 47:23.131
Don't hang that self-help bullshit on me.

47:23.215 --> 47:24.716
You know what's bullshit?

47:24.800 --> 47:27.177
Getting stabbed
because you're caught off guard,

47:27.261 --> 47:28.929
off task, and probably drunk.

47:29.012 --> 47:31.557
You want to be a hero,
but you don't walk the walk.

47:31.640 --> 47:33.910
How many times have you trained
in the past year? Or ever?

47:33.934 --> 47:35.853
Better yet,
how many bottles have you drained?

47:35.936 --> 47:37.437
Hand it over, now.

47:37.521 --> 47:43.110
I've spent the past year honing my skills,
evolving into the best version of myself.

47:43.193 --> 47:46.697
I'm unstoppable.
And I have all my organs intact.

47:53.954 --> 47:55.706
So I've learned something recently.

47:56.582 --> 47:58.000
Something you should know.

47:59.543 --> 48:01.086
No one is unstoppable.

48:09.887 --> 48:14.016
Hello, Mr. Brandt.
This is Lucia calling from the gallery.

48:14.099 --> 48:16.685
You'll be happy to know
that your lot has sold.

48:17.895 --> 48:21.315
Yes, I'm actually looking
at the cashier's check right now.

48:21.398 --> 48:23.108
Where would you like that delivered?

48:39.124 --> 48:40.125
Shit!

48:42.628 --> 48:43.712
Don't even bother.

48:45.923 --> 48:47.299
What is this place?

48:48.050 --> 48:51.261
And if you say it's your man cave,
this will end even worse than you think.

48:51.345 --> 48:52.625
Take whatever you want.

48:53.513 --> 48:57.976
I don't do cars. But I am super
into 20th century figurative sculpture.

48:58.769 --> 49:02.898
I may be down a major organ,
but I have gained a fine arts education.

49:02.981 --> 49:05.484
What the hell do you want from me?

49:05.567 --> 49:08.445
What do you think I want, asshole?

49:08.528 --> 49:09.613
Did my sister hire you?

49:09.696 --> 49:12.658
If Madeline wants the Cataldo that bad,
she can keep it.

49:12.741 --> 49:14.618
I don't give a shit about the sculpture.

49:14.701 --> 49:17.621
I do give a shit
that you hired someone to stab me.

49:17.704 --> 49:22.626
Stab you? Why? How?
All you people have impenetrable skin.

49:22.709 --> 49:25.545
You took my goddamn spleen.

49:25.629 --> 49:29.216
No, you came after me.
You and your masked friend.

49:29.299 --> 49:32.886
I've been hiding out here
ever since you two busted into my place.

49:32.970 --> 49:36.974
Who am I gonna hire? No one will risk
pissing off a couple supers.

49:46.274 --> 49:48.777
What are you gonna do to me?

49:55.367 --> 49:56.994
Ms. Walker, call for you.

49:58.704 --> 50:01.748
Oh, thank you. Excuse me one second?

50:03.834 --> 50:04.835
Trish Walker.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.879
Brandt's not the one that came after me.

50:10.590 --> 50:12.342
- Then who was it?
- <i>I don't know.</i>

50:12.426 --> 50:15.887
But Brandt's at 597 East 23rd,
and he's not going anywhere.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.808
He's your win. You'll know what to do.

50:32.237 --> 50:33.947
He's having an affair.

50:35.198 --> 50:36.450
With a student.

50:37.242 --> 50:38.410
It's not enough.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.247
It's enough to get him axed.

50:42.789 --> 50:43.957
It's not what I need.

50:44.875 --> 50:46.918
Then, what? Who is this guy to you?

50:54.801 --> 50:56.428
What do you want me to do?

50:56.511 --> 51:00.223
I want you to do what you do best.
Dig deeper.

51:12.694 --> 51:13.987
Still no flowers.

51:14.071 --> 51:16.073
My station got an anonymous call

51:16.156 --> 51:18.450
about a perp we've been trying
to pin down for months.

51:18.533 --> 51:19.409
Yeah?

51:19.493 --> 51:22.579
The unis found him gift wrapped
with hard evidence against him.

51:22.662 --> 51:25.749
Kept whining about a couple
of powered chicks that were after him.

51:25.832 --> 51:29.169
He mentioned you and a masked woman
whose face he never saw.

51:30.462 --> 51:32.130
Is that the guy who attacked you?

51:32.214 --> 51:33.590
My guy is still out there.

51:33.673 --> 51:36.843
I'm sorry to hear that.
Who's the masked hero?

51:36.927 --> 51:39.346
What?
You think we all know each other?

51:41.431 --> 51:43.809
- You did good.
- It wasn't me.

51:44.392 --> 51:47.854
Well, I'm glad you have somebody.
There really is strength in numbers.

51:49.314 --> 51:50.315
Take care.

51:51.274 --> 51:52.484
Keep your door locked.

52:24.224 --> 52:27.102
Any interest in a massive amount of booze?

52:51.585 --> 52:55.630
You do realize a glass window on the door
defeats the purpose of a dead bolt?

52:55.714 --> 52:57.048
Thanks for the tip.

52:58.717 --> 53:00.051
I owe you 50 bucks.

53:00.135 --> 53:02.596
- You ate the burger.
- Yeah.

53:08.518 --> 53:10.562
Well, you... uh, you look better.

53:11.104 --> 53:12.355
Uh, quick healer.

53:14.065 --> 53:16.735
Yeah, that asshole clearly had
no idea what he was up against.

53:20.197 --> 53:22.032
He brought a knife to a gunfight.

53:24.326 --> 53:27.162
You being the... the gunfight, of course.

53:35.795 --> 53:36.795
Jessica?

53:43.386 --> 53:46.473
So, um... you called me?

53:52.229 --> 53:53.229
Ooh.

53:54.022 --> 53:56.024
There is one thing I would like to know.

53:57.192 --> 53:58.193
Shoot.

54:00.487 --> 54:03.073
Tell me why someone wants to kill you.

54:03.156 --> 54:05.325
Um...
