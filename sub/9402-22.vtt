So, did you like
the movie, Jamie?

11:49.083 --> 11:50.116
It was okay.

11:50.167 --> 11:52.469
It wasn't very believable,
though.

11:52.553 --> 11:54.137
Why do you say that?

11:54.222 --> 11:59.059
Well, you know the part where
the girl forgives the guy?

11:59.126 --> 12:01.628
It doesn't really work
like that in real life.

12:45.424 --> 12:47.776

saying to you, Lydia Scott?

12:50.363 --> 12:51.947

- Yes.

12:53.399 --> 12:55.200
Are you two ready
to open up the new café?

12:55.267 --> 12:57.485
Yes, we are! Oh.
Yeah.

12:57.570 --> 13:00.104
Hey. Thank you
for everything.

13:00.156 --> 13:03.325
I know that you've been
working so much and traveling,

13:03.409 --> 13:05.944

that you're here.

13:05.995 --> 13:07.412

We're live

13:22.345 --> 13:24.946
Today we're live from the corner
of Front and Grace

13:25.014 --> 13:26.348
where, once upon a time,

13:26.415 --> 13:28.817
there sat a little diner
called Karen's Café,

13:28.884 --> 13:32.804
where Haley James Scott
performed and waited tables.

13:32.855 --> 13:35.607
The diner then became the former
home of Clothes Over Bros,

13:35.658 --> 13:39.611
where I worked for and with
my good friend Brooke Davis.

13:39.662 --> 13:41.947
Brooke, what brings us
here today?

13:41.998 --> 13:46.117
Well, today is the grand
re-opening of Karen's Café,

13:46.168 --> 13:50.171
where Haley James Scott
will again work and perform.

13:50.256 --> 13:53.008
But let's get started

21:30.191 --> 21:32.859

21:32.944 --> 21:35.645
I used to work out
at night.

21:35.696 --> 21:37.614
And there was
this late-night janitor

21:37.665 --> 21:39.249
who would come in
to clean up.

21:39.316 --> 21:41.501
And for weeks,
we never spoke to each other.

21:41.586 --> 21:43.152
He would do his thing,
I would do mine,

21:43.204 --> 21:44.504
and that was that.

21:44.589 --> 21:45.839

21:45.923 --> 21:48.541
he asked me
why I was always there so late.

21:48.626 --> 21:53.296
And I told him that I felt like
this was my last chance...

21:53.347 --> 21:56.883

but I worked as hard as I could,

21:56.968 --> 21:58.551
