01:24.382 --> 01:25.398
Are we good?

02:26.924 --> 02:28.388
I have to check it.

03:11.469 --> 03:12.364
I have it.

03:14.744 --> 03:15.537
It's real.

03:16.505 --> 03:17.520
Money first.

03:17.935 --> 03:19.985
He says money first.

03:49.526 --> 03:51.427
Nice doing business with you.

04:00.864 --> 04:02.074
What did I miss?

04:03.953 --> 04:04.677
Iggy.

04:08.835 --> 04:10.320
Who the hell are you?

04:13.117 --> 04:14.641
Weasel, don't. I--

04:17.151 --> 04:19.255
My friend marco here
made a silly mistake,

04:19.289 --> 04:21.652
and sold you something
that belongs to me.

04:21.653 --> 04:24.881
Now, I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take it back.

04:25.780 --> 04:26.770
Get out.

04:32.367 --> 04:33.597
Easy.

04:40.594 --> 04:42.701
Why does he keep
clicking that pen, man?

04:42.702 --> 04:43.918
Shoot him!

05:02.189 --> 05:03.163
Robbery?

05:05.770 --> 05:08.152
Doesn't look like
the register's been touched.

05:12.047 --> 05:13.812
Smells like somebody
had a barbecue.

05:21.077 --> 05:22.100
Somebody did.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.590
What the hell happened
to you, friend?

05:40.961 --> 05:42.357
I thought we had two bodies.

05:44.378 --> 05:45.292
We do.

06:01.484 --> 06:02.473
Ruby.

06:03.551 --> 06:04.579
Hello, peaches.

06:05.570 --> 06:07.061
Nice homicides.

06:07.062 --> 06:09.838
- Only the best for you, Ruby.
- Who's our friend, the owner?

06:09.839 --> 06:12.079
Uh, manager. Jake Scuillo.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.863
Owner's a guy named
Karl Kreutzfeld. Not present.

06:14.864 --> 06:16.523
Ruber, you got a cause of death?

06:16.524 --> 06:18.596
Funny you should ask me that,
because no.

06:18.725 --> 06:21.226
- How 'bout burnt to a crisp?
- How 'bout not?

06:21.227 --> 06:25.561
Look it. The clothes.
They should have lit up first.

06:25.597 --> 06:28.344
What, they torched him,
then they dressed him?

06:28.508 --> 06:29.817
Electrocuted, maybe.

06:32.570 --> 06:33.931
What about our superhero?

06:33.932 --> 06:37.160
Marco Cordova.
Customer, apparently.

06:37.161 --> 06:40.994
Neck's broken, like he was
shot out of a cannon.

06:42.556 --> 06:44.464
This doesn't make any sense.

06:44.476 --> 06:46.348
You guys might want
to call the cops.

06:47.271 --> 06:50.809
I mean, thrown against
the wall, okay. But this-

06:50.810 --> 06:52.292
We've got a possible witness.

06:53.821 --> 06:55.178
Ignacio llosa.

06:56.668 --> 06:59.022
- Punched in. Never punched out.
- Oh, jeez.

06:59.962 --> 07:01.471
- You know him, Joe?
- Yeah,

07:01.660 --> 07:04.265
he's a sweet kid, but he's got
a nightmare family.

07:04.700 --> 07:05.692
Let's pick him up.

07:13.679 --> 07:14.914
Mr. Montague,

07:15.267 --> 07:16.978
I gotta go to work
in the morning.

07:17.287 --> 07:19.869
I'd kinda like to get some
sleep tonight at some-

07:21.701 --> 07:25.384
Maybe you should have thought
about that before you lost the key.

07:29.986 --> 07:31.806
We gotta find that kid.

07:32.557 --> 07:33.383
Make a left.

07:40.130 --> 07:42.771
Kathy and me are going up
to the lake this weekend.

07:42.772 --> 07:44.380
You and Anna can come, if you want.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.316
You don't have to invite us
every time you go up there, Lou.

07:47.317 --> 07:49.621
Are you kidding?
Kathy loves that kid.

07:52.618 --> 07:53.880
What did your lawyer say?

07:54.603 --> 07:56.463
Vanessa might have a case.

07:56.781 --> 07:59.575
You're her father.
You stuck around.

07:59.951 --> 08:01.680
You're not gonna lose that kid.

08:03.920 --> 08:05.739
Wait, wait, wait.
Stop, stop stop.

08:05.740 --> 08:06.666
That's Iggy.

08:19.620 --> 08:21.616
Iggy! Stop!

08:32.491 --> 08:33.655
Iggy!

08:40.153 --> 08:41.328
Iggy, open up.

08:41.809 --> 08:43.121
Hang on.

08:48.612 --> 08:49.770
Where is he?

08:59.017 --> 09:00.195
He's gone.

09:10.561 --> 09:12.355
I want that cop's name.

09:14.741 --> 09:15.966
Can I be done?

09:16.961 --> 09:18.462
- Okeydoke.
- Thank you.

09:18.463 --> 09:20.406
Hey, hey, hey.
Dishes, missy.

09:23.165 --> 09:24.223
How was school today?

09:25.654 --> 09:27.932
Billy Frazier brought in
a huge earthworm.

09:27.933 --> 09:29.799
- Yeah?
- I touched it.

09:30.419 --> 09:32.934
- Disgusting.
- Yeah.

09:32.935 --> 09:33.679
Come here.

09:34.258 --> 09:35.512
Let me see your hand.

09:37.443 --> 09:39.691
- Ew, I can still feel the slime!
- No, you can't!

09:39.692 --> 09:41.570
I can. Oh--

09:44.599 --> 09:45.621
Miller.

09:45.622 --> 09:46.866
We just picked up Iggy.

09:46.867 --> 09:49.073
<i>At his mom's.
You better get in here, Joe.</i>

09:49.074 --> 09:50.470
I'll be right there.

09:57.718 --> 09:59.620
- Hi, Lee.
- Hi, Anna baby.

10:00.266 --> 10:01.660
You got Iggy?

10:01.834 --> 10:03.203
You need the interview room?

10:03.407 --> 10:04.650
No, my office.

10:05.532 --> 10:06.522
You mind?

10:14.034 --> 10:16.177
You swore to me I'd
never see you in here.

10:17.381 --> 10:18.396
You swore.

10:19.330 --> 10:21.270
Look at me when
i'm talking to you!

10:22.242 --> 10:23.797
Two men got burnt to death.

10:24.367 --> 10:25.360
Tell me what happened.

10:27.214 --> 10:29.562
- I can't.
- You can't?

10:29.563 --> 10:32.719
Your old man would have killed you
if your mom hadn't killed him first.

10:32.720 --> 10:36.759
I convinced the D.A.
it was self-defense. I lied for you.

10:37.616 --> 10:39.598
If I tell you, my mom's dead.

10:44.708 --> 10:46.524
I'll protect her.
I promise.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.408
But, detective Joe,
who's gonna protect you?

11:06.970 --> 11:07.824
Nice watch.

11:08.017 --> 11:09.714
- Can I use the bathroom?
- No.

11:10.935 --> 11:13.419
- I feel like i'm gonna puke.
- I'll bet you do.

11:17.257 --> 11:18.303
What's this?

11:21.707 --> 11:24.226
You have an apartment.
What's with the motel key?

11:26.909 --> 11:29.228
You don't know what motel
you're staying in?!

11:29.229 --> 11:30.634
It's not a real place.

11:32.035 --> 11:32.599
What?

11:32.600 --> 11:35.681
- I'm gonna puke. I'm gonna go to the...
- Sit down! Sit down!

11:36.382 --> 11:40.160
You're not going anywhere until you tell me
what's going on. Now, what is going on?

11:40.653 --> 11:42.243
Just tell me what happened.

11:42.732 --> 11:44.211
How'd he burn'em?

11:45.987 --> 11:47.596
Three dudes came in.

11:47.936 --> 11:49.627
I never seen them before.

11:49.662 --> 11:52.233
The main guy,
they called him the weasel.

11:52.362 --> 11:53.343
How did he burn 'em?

11:55.984 --> 11:57.800
How did he burn 'em, Iggy?
Tell me.

12:02.255 --> 12:03.429
Iggy!

12:37.953 --> 12:39.303
I got the phone records.

12:41.348 --> 12:44.705
Our fried guy called his boss
just before he got killed.

12:45.515 --> 12:46.268
His boss?

12:46.538 --> 12:48.921
The guy who owns the pawn shop
Karl Kreutzfeld.

13:02.632 --> 13:04.581
<i>That's so awesome.</i>

13:11.643 --> 13:13.051
Happy birthday, Isaac.

13:14.103 --> 13:16.206
Time for cake an icecream, come on!

13:17.305 --> 13:20.083
Mr. Kreutzfeld, did you make all this
money in a pawn shop?

13:20.103 --> 13:21.106
Oh God, no.

13:21.935 --> 13:24.057
No, I own a chain of dry cleaners.

13:24.058 --> 13:25.485
I admit, it's ridiculous

13:25.486 --> 13:28.707
how much people pay to have
their clothes washed without water.

13:29.288 --> 13:29.982
The...

13:30.329 --> 13:33.030
pawn shop is my grandfather's. Was.

13:34.071 --> 13:35.113
Now it's mine.

13:35.962 --> 13:37.484
It was his life, actually. He...

13:37.630 --> 13:39.231
loved things.

13:39.617 --> 13:43.225
Show me your things, and I can tell you
your life story. Something like that.

13:43.959 --> 13:46.467
Please understand, I've never
had an employee

13:46.468 --> 13:48.647
killed on the job before.
This is

13:48.801 --> 13:51.000
very disturbing, to say the least.

13:51.193 --> 13:53.797
Jake Scuillo called you just
before the time of the murders.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.654
Yeah, he wanted to know about
closing up early. Business was slow,

13:56.655 --> 13:57.995
which is not unusual.

13:59.234 --> 14:01.627
What about your other employee,
Ignacio Llosa?

14:05.388 --> 14:06.546
Make a wish, Isaac.

14:12.179 --> 14:13.973
Did he mention anything
about a key?

14:16.346 --> 14:17.234
A key?

14:17.755 --> 14:19.993
No, he didn't say anything
about a key.

14:21.680 --> 14:23.783
I'm sorry I'm so distracted today.

14:24.053 --> 14:26.311
If there's anything else
I can do, to help,

14:26.485 --> 14:30.382
please call me. I sincerely hope you
catch this son of a bitch.

14:31.095 --> 14:31.751
Thank you.

14:32.409 --> 14:33.798
I don't care about the money.

14:33.971 --> 14:35.360
I just want to get rid of it.

14:35.785 --> 14:37.425
I'm in a parking lot.

14:37.811 --> 14:38.428
Hello?

14:38.640 --> 14:39.296
Jennifer?

14:42.591 --> 14:44.790
I've got it here.
Where are you?

14:46.623 --> 14:47.915
Hello, Jennifer?

15:17.733 --> 15:20.125
- So, what do you want to watch tonight?
- Nemo.

15:21.302 --> 15:22.691
Again? Come on.

15:23.502 --> 15:24.216
How about

15:24.505 --> 15:25.605
Abbot & Costello?

15:26.338 --> 15:27.303
Nemo.

15:27.747 --> 15:29.483
Abbot & Costello meet Frankenstein?

15:30.671 --> 15:32.446
Come on, it's got Frankenstein.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.182
Stay there.

15:59.178 --> 16:00.914
Anna, go to your room, now!

16:02.708 --> 16:03.345
Iggy?

16:05.058 --> 16:06.659
I'm sorry, detective Joe.

16:10.287 --> 16:11.560
Hang in there, all right?

16:13.141 --> 16:14.685
This is detective Joe Miller.

16:14.686 --> 16:17.212
I need an ambulance.
I've got a kid bleeding to death.

16:17.534 --> 16:18.402
I'm sorry.

16:19.714 --> 16:20.678
There's no one else.

16:21.778 --> 16:22.897
They double-crossed me.

16:24.247 --> 16:25.077
I'm sorry.

16:25.660 --> 16:26.548
I'm sorry...

16:27.397 --> 16:28.130
it's you.

16:30.542 --> 16:31.352
It opens...

16:32.375 --> 16:33.397
every door.

16:34.478 --> 16:36.252
It opens every...

16:37.931 --> 16:38.490
door.

16:38.491 --> 16:39.918
What are you talking about?

16:40.041 --> 16:40.890
It opens...

16:41.237 --> 16:41.662
every...

16:42.163 --> 16:42.877
door.

17:10.910 --> 17:12.366
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

17:12.685 --> 17:14.517
You want to sleep
at our place tonight?

17:16.224 --> 17:17.324
No. We're all right.

17:17.720 --> 17:18.511
We're good.

17:20.787 --> 17:23.413
Hey, listen, there's something 
I want to talk to you about.

17:24.606 --> 17:25.628
Hey, sweetie.

17:26.748 --> 17:28.580
No, they're gonna stay here tonight.

18:42.963 --> 18:44.178
My God.

20:49.893 --> 20:50.568
Hi.

20:58.517 --> 20:59.694
Take me home.

21:09.379 --> 21:10.247
Dad?

21:12.234 --> 21:13.314
What's in there?

21:15.475 --> 21:16.845
It's just a dream, sweetheart.

21:29.192 --> 21:30.002
You see?

21:38.933 --> 21:39.744
Back to bed.

21:47.847 --> 21:50.412
1968, burn victim.

21:51.030 --> 21:52.322
Unsolved.

21:55.505 --> 21:57.492
He swallowed a motel key?

22:04.438 --> 22:06.020
Pawn shop victim.

22:07.043 --> 22:08.779
The entry wounds are the same.

22:19.370 --> 22:21.415
- I'm sorry.
- It's me.

22:21.724 --> 22:23.094
Are you coming to bed, Martin?

22:23.383 --> 22:24.733
Yeah, actually, sweetie.

22:32.562 --> 22:34.183
Can you make animal pancakes?

22:35.957 --> 22:37.829
Can I make animal pancakes?

22:38.388 --> 22:40.086
What kind of animal
pancakes you want?

22:40.453 --> 22:41.282
Elephant.

22:42.299 --> 22:45.038
I don't know how to make
an elephant, but how 'bout a mouse?

22:45.039 --> 22:46.158
Elephant.

22:46.741 --> 22:47.898
All right,

22:49.210 --> 22:51.082
one elephant pancake coming up.

23:03.053 --> 23:03.670
Yeah.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.252
Hey, Lou.

23:07.065 --> 23:10.181
She's a little spooked, but she seems
like she's doing all right.

23:10.944 --> 23:12.680
We have another court date tomorrow.

23:13.838 --> 23:15.719
But right now I'm making
elephant pancakes.

23:15.720 --> 23:16.915
Everything's pretty normal.

23:17.041 --> 23:18.468
Hey, Anna, check this out.

23:23.677 --> 23:25.973
Stuff keeps disappearing in the room.

23:27.130 --> 23:27.767
What room?

23:27.960 --> 23:29.214
The magic room.

23:36.844 --> 23:37.442
Okay.

23:39.430 --> 23:40.105
Pick one.

23:41.301 --> 23:43.423
You know, I don't think
we should be doing this.

23:45.044 --> 23:46.934
Just pick... pick a stuffed animal.

23:48.735 --> 23:49.256
All right.

23:49.912 --> 23:51.880
Not Lester Bony fish.

23:52.169 --> 23:52.671
Okay.

23:53.346 --> 23:54.735
Okay, this one.

23:54.913 --> 23:55.781
This one?

23:55.800 --> 23:57.324
- You sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

24:00.767 --> 24:01.790
Now watch.

24:21.255 --> 24:23.223
Hey, Anna, Anna, get back here.

24:24.458 --> 24:26.831
Anna, what are you doing?
Come on, get out of there.

24:29.329 --> 24:30.159
Okay.

24:30.274 --> 24:31.953
Experiment over, okay?

24:32.860 --> 24:33.458
That's it.

24:33.666 --> 24:34.572
Open it.

24:51.097 --> 24:52.776
Come on, that's it, okay?
Game over.

24:53.162 --> 24:53.663
Okay?

24:53.833 --> 24:54.875
Oh, Dad.

24:55.280 --> 24:56.322
Listen. Listen to me.

24:56.341 --> 24:58.618
I need you to make me a promise.
All right?

24:59.428 --> 25:02.148
Not to tell anyone about
the room, or the key...

25:02.857 --> 25:04.864
- Or anything else, all right?
- Okay.

25:06.947 --> 25:07.680
Promise me.

25:08.182 --> 25:09.127
I promise.

25:20.191 --> 25:22.603
- Duuh! Jeez, Joe!
- Good morning.

25:22.835 --> 25:24.340
You scared the hell
out of me.

25:25.189 --> 25:26.269
How'd you, uh--

25:26.462 --> 25:27.851
I know how Ignacio did it.

25:29.510 --> 25:30.263
Get dressed.

25:38.587 --> 25:40.574
What if it resets
while we're in there?

25:42.214 --> 25:44.587
I think as long as
we have the key, we're safe.

26:51.398 --> 26:53.115
We got water and electricity.

26:56.510 --> 26:57.475
We can go anywhere?

26:57.880 --> 26:59.385
Anywhere with a door, I think.

27:01.410 --> 27:02.452
Penn state's playing.

27:14.586 --> 27:16.034
According to the money transfert,

27:16.035 --> 27:18.639
someone tried to buy this key
for two million bucks.

27:18.967 --> 27:20.047
I'd pay three.

27:23.366 --> 27:26.259
Well, we can't keep it.
Three people are dead because of it.

27:26.260 --> 27:27.089
I know.

27:29.288 --> 27:30.793
But let's enjoy it now.

27:31.256 --> 27:32.645
While we can. Okay?

27:33.262 --> 27:35.712
Who knows if we're gonna get
another chance like this.

27:35.886 --> 27:36.503
Yeah.

27:38.862 --> 27:40.058
Hey, Bridgewater.

27:42.644 --> 27:44.766
Direct from Cuba,
but you didn't get it from me.

27:44.767 --> 27:46.792
Keep it. I don't smoke
those stinky things.

27:46.808 --> 27:48.718
Me neither.
I just like giving them away.

27:49.297 --> 27:51.573
You got a visitor.
Jennifer Llosa.

27:51.978 --> 27:53.406
Iggy's sister.

27:58.904 --> 28:00.226
I'm sorry about your brother.

28:00.371 --> 28:01.181
Half brother.

28:03.052 --> 28:03.670
Thanks.

28:06.178 --> 28:07.547
Were you and Ignacio close?

28:07.625 --> 28:09.322
I left home... early.

28:09.727 --> 28:10.595
I always thought

28:11.290 --> 28:14.319
we'd be closer when he got older,
but... I guess not.

28:19.933 --> 28:23.048
My mother asked me to come down
for any outstanding paperwork.

28:24.428 --> 28:26.300
I'm pretty sure
it's all taken care of.

28:26.570 --> 28:28.132
Unless you want
to sign for his

28:29.502 --> 28:30.640
personal effects.

28:36.910 --> 28:38.338
So, Jennifer Llosa.

28:43.547 --> 28:44.492
Something wrong?

28:45.823 --> 28:47.405
Iggy didn't have
a sister.

28:48.756 --> 28:50.762
You took it, didn't you?

28:55.412 --> 28:56.454
Tell me what it is.

28:56.531 --> 28:57.920
I'm responsible for that key.

28:58.595 --> 29:00.254
- Give it to me.
- Who are you?

29:02.454 --> 29:04.171
- Let me go.
- Not until you tell me.

29:07.856 --> 29:08.782
Let me show you.

29:17.189 --> 29:17.749
<i>Hey, Joe!</i>

29:18.829 --> 29:19.312
Joe!

29:28.109 --> 29:28.784
You okay?

29:30.077 --> 29:30.772
What's wrong?

29:34.592 --> 29:35.672
She knows.

29:36.713 --> 29:37.331
Who?

29:49.176 --> 29:50.450
Miller has the key.

29:54.269 --> 29:55.350
Do I have to get a shot?

29:55.351 --> 29:57.298
No, I told you,
it's not that kind of a doctor.

29:57.299 --> 30:00.739
They just want to ask you some questions
about what it's like to live here and stuff.

30:00.975 --> 30:02.192
Do I have to go?

30:06.866 --> 30:07.273
Yeah.

30:07.595 --> 30:07.995
You do.

30:08.864 --> 30:10.292
These people just want to help us,

30:10.293 --> 30:12.588
and make sure that we're doing good.
And we are, right?

30:12.611 --> 30:15.750
Yeah, except for you not
letting me stay up late.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.741
Well, you make sure
and tell Dr. Gellman that.

30:19.223 --> 30:19.729
Okay.

30:20.125 --> 30:20.570
All right.

30:25.305 --> 30:26.405
Anna Miller?

30:30.302 --> 30:30.881
You ready?

30:31.730 --> 30:32.559
Yeah.

30:35.878 --> 30:38.637
<i>Paging Dr. Steadman,
Dr. Steadman, please.</i>

30:41.589 --> 30:42.168
Okay.

30:42.612 --> 30:43.827
Have fun.
Tell the truth.

30:44.503 --> 30:45.872
Okay, I will.

30:56.695 --> 30:58.894
Do you know how long
this is gonna be? We have a

30:58.933 --> 31:01.904
- court thing at 17h.
- It'll be a couple of hours.

31:01.981 --> 31:04.335
If you'd like, there's a coffee shop
across the street

31:04.336 --> 31:05.801
- from the hospital.
- Thank you.

31:14.179 --> 31:16.585
I'm through eating this mush.
I'm getting some real food.

31:16.586 --> 31:19.229
- Mr. Jabrowski,get back in bed.
- Get your hands off me!

31:20.426 --> 31:24.256
For your crimes against decency,
and politeness, and common courtesy,

31:24.949 --> 31:26.740
I condemn you to Hell!

31:35.258 --> 31:35.856
Hey!

31:38.346 --> 31:39.175
Hey.

31:57.277 --> 31:57.837
Hey.

32:03.065 --> 32:04.280
Where am I, man?

32:15.162 --> 32:16.281
I don't know.

32:19.291 --> 32:20.371
Oh, man.

32:50.815 --> 32:51.645
Hospital.

33:00.356 --> 33:01.244
Wait, don't...

33:06.317 --> 33:07.185
do that.

34:02.864 --> 34:04.967
Why won't you stay gone?!

34:20.150 --> 34:21.616
So you're the new
motel guy?

34:21.654 --> 34:23.641
- Tell me about the bus ticket.
- Why?

34:29.063 --> 34:30.219
You want it back or not?

34:31.937 --> 34:33.538
- What's your name?
- Wally.

34:34.040 --> 34:34.754
Wally,

34:35.871 --> 34:37.165
I'm detective Joe Miller.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.580
Cop?
Interesting angle.

34:43.570 --> 34:45.286
What were you
in the hospital for?

34:46.695 --> 34:47.679
Hemorrhoids.

34:48.045 --> 34:50.688
Laser surgery.
What's it to you, detective?

34:51.487 --> 34:53.418
My daughter's here for a
psyche evaluation,

34:53.418 --> 34:55.501
her mother's suing for custody
after three years,

34:55.502 --> 34:57.427
and she'll probably win,
thanks for asking.

34:57.543 --> 34:58.894
Oh, sorry.

34:59.858 --> 35:00.302
I mean,

35:01.440 --> 35:02.096
sorry.

35:02.636 --> 35:04.305
You forget to be
human sometimes.

35:06.089 --> 35:07.575
<i>Can I get you anything else?</i>

35:08.231 --> 35:09.022
Thank you.

35:15.118 --> 35:16.044
It's on me.

35:16.064 --> 35:18.958
Can I have a greek omelet?
Actually, two.

35:21.331 --> 35:23.511
I blew the last of my
money on the surgery.

35:28.643 --> 35:30.186
Put it... Put it away!

35:32.463 --> 35:34.084
- What is it?
- Is this a joke?

35:34.508 --> 35:35.077
No.

35:37.402 --> 35:38.964
I don't know what it is.

35:41.434 --> 35:42.707
Nice talking to you.

35:42.839 --> 35:43.977
Okay, okay.

35:48.183 --> 35:49.842
It's an object.

35:52.041 --> 35:52.717
Yeah?

35:54.626 --> 35:56.054
One of many.

35:56.304 --> 35:57.635
Okay, where do they
come from?

35:57.828 --> 36:00.413
From the motel room.

36:00.549 --> 36:03.230
All the objects come
from the motel room,

36:03.231 --> 36:05.371
you've been there,
you used the key, right?

36:06.074 --> 36:08.158
You really don't know
what I'm talking about?

36:09.808 --> 36:10.946
Holy crap.

36:11.641 --> 36:14.938
It's amateur hour. This guy's got the key,
doesn't even know what it is.

36:16.831 --> 36:18.162
How many objects are there?

36:22.098 --> 36:24.124
All right. All right.
All right.

36:26.168 --> 36:28.308
There's a lot of 'em.
About a hundred, at least.

36:28.309 --> 36:29.650
Nobody really knows for sure.

36:30.142 --> 36:31.126
A hundred?

36:33.296 --> 36:34.743
- And do they all...
- They do...

36:34.975 --> 36:36.171
weird stuff.

36:36.673 --> 36:38.544
Some are useful, some aren't.

36:39.055 --> 36:42.035
Used to know a guy who had the pencil.
You know what the pencil does?

36:42.036 --> 36:43.039
Makes pennies.

36:43.193 --> 36:45.007
Tap it on the table,
penny falls out.

36:45.238 --> 36:45.856
That's it.

36:46.416 --> 36:49.387
Guy made 500 bucks a day
tapping the damn pencil noon to night.

36:50.564 --> 36:51.470
Six months of that,

36:51.606 --> 36:52.744
tapped his brains out.

36:53.757 --> 36:55.532
Then there's the umbrella.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.143
Makes people think
they know you.

36:57.152 --> 36:59.140
Particularly helpful
if you're shy.

36:59.236 --> 37:01.436
Last guy who had it
moved to Seattle,

37:01.513 --> 37:03.075
to be less conspicuous.

37:03.386 --> 37:04.872
But other objects...

37:05.007 --> 37:06.627
say the...

37:06.704 --> 37:08.267
key, for example,

37:08.749 --> 37:10.138
highly useful.

37:13.707 --> 37:14.864
What about the bus ticket?

37:15.269 --> 37:16.176
Not that useful.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.937
Unless you want to get to a little spot
outside Gallup, New Mexico, in a jiffy,

37:19.938 --> 37:21.037
which I don't.

37:21.297 --> 37:22.127
Why Gallup?

37:23.265 --> 37:24.037
Why not?

37:27.148 --> 37:28.730
What happened in that motel room?

37:31.778 --> 37:32.434
Wally.

37:38.859 --> 37:40.055
Something terrible.

37:41.425 --> 37:41.888
Look...

37:43.528 --> 37:44.608
detective Miller,

37:45.689 --> 37:48.621
do you ever feel that there's
something wrong with the universe?

37:49.084 --> 37:49.818
Yeah, sure.

37:50.010 --> 37:51.534
Well, you're right.

37:51.978 --> 37:54.486
Things like this
shouldn't happen.

37:55.027 --> 37:56.995
But in that motel room,
they did.

37:58.094 --> 38:00.487
Nobody really knows what happened,

38:00.488 --> 38:02.763
but everybody's got a theory.
Some people think that

38:03.207 --> 38:05.117
God died,

38:05.300 --> 38:08.194
and that all these objects,
they're little pieces of his corpse.

38:08.850 --> 38:10.393
Some people say that's crap.

38:10.683 --> 38:11.957
They think that

38:11.995 --> 38:14.812
some part of the universe
broke down, and it's just

38:14.947 --> 38:16.622
physics gone haywire.

38:16.623 --> 38:18.453
And other people think
that God is alive,

38:18.454 --> 38:19.807
and this is some kind of test.

38:19.808 --> 38:24.129
And they're all out trying
to collect all the objects like

38:24.269 --> 38:26.826
pilgrims looking for relics
during the middle ages.

38:28.909 --> 38:30.163
And what do you think, Wally?

38:31.321 --> 38:32.884
Who gives two squirts?

38:34.157 --> 38:35.257
All that matters

38:35.801 --> 38:37.035
is the price.

38:37.305 --> 38:38.868
That's what nobody gets.

38:39.138 --> 38:41.222
There's always a price to pay

38:41.453 --> 38:43.132
for using the objects.

38:43.670 --> 38:44.982
Whether you know it or not,

38:45.291 --> 38:46.564
there's always

38:46.834 --> 38:47.644
a price.

38:50.866 --> 38:52.255
What price did you pay?

38:53.721 --> 38:55.939
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

38:57.406 --> 38:57.831
See,

38:58.081 --> 39:00.261
objects attract one
another like magnets.

39:00.415 --> 39:02.403
You think we ran into
each other by accident?

39:02.673 --> 39:05.714
Every time you use that key,
it's like alarms going off.

39:07.411 --> 39:08.993
People are coming for you, Joe.

39:09.263 --> 39:10.054
Bad people.

39:10.382 --> 39:11.964
They're crawling out
of the woodwork.

39:11.965 --> 39:14.896
They don't even know who you are,
but they're already looking for you.

39:14.897 --> 39:17.964
Probably emptying your underwear drawer
right now, looking for that thing.

39:17.965 --> 39:21.436
And I think you understand me when I say
that they won't mind killing you...

39:21.861 --> 39:24.022
or killing your family
to get their hands on it.

39:26.201 --> 39:27.050
Anna.

39:37.565 --> 39:38.105
Hi.

39:38.607 --> 39:39.282
Anna Miller?

39:40.417 --> 39:42.452
Anna Miller,
is she still with the doctor?

39:42.548 --> 39:44.410
Where's the other receptionist?
Anna miller.

39:44.411 --> 39:46.397
I'm sorry, sir,
she already left.

39:47.960 --> 39:49.445
Left? What do you mean she left?!

39:50.275 --> 39:51.471
With her father?

39:58.956 --> 39:59.554
Miller.

39:59.902 --> 40:02.371
<i>I think you have something
of mine, detective Miller.</i>

40:03.239 --> 40:04.204
Who is this?

40:06.462 --> 40:07.908
I know I have
something of yours.

40:09.355 --> 40:10.339
Care to trade?

40:20.824 --> 40:22.116
Come on, come on, pick up.

40:23.409 --> 40:27.815
Lou, it's me. They got Anna. She's in
a rail station off of route. Call me.

41:19.132 --> 41:20.135
Lose the doors.

41:20.733 --> 41:21.350
Burn 'em.

42:24.446 --> 42:25.295
Daddy!

42:45.398 --> 42:46.363
Hey, Joe.

42:48.851 --> 42:50.337
Were my directions okay?

42:55.411 --> 42:58.227
- What does the gun do?
- It shoots bullets really fast.

43:02.355 --> 43:03.494
It's gonna be okay.

43:07.892 --> 43:09.436
Do you know what
the pen can do...

43:10.198 --> 43:11.423
detective Miller?

43:13.256 --> 43:14.780
It can cook your daughter

43:15.648 --> 43:16.671
like a microwave.

43:20.143 --> 43:20.760
Here...

43:24.253 --> 43:25.082
let me show you.

43:26.510 --> 43:27.648
Stop.

43:37.449 --> 43:38.915
Smart man, your father.

43:41.230 --> 43:42.465
I'll give you the key.

43:44.530 --> 43:45.976
You'll give me
my daughter back,

43:47.655 --> 43:49.420
and then you'll leave,
understand?

43:50.626 --> 43:51.397
Of course.

44:10.381 --> 44:11.538
Grab him!

44:31.293 --> 44:33.377
You killed my brother!

45:09.287 --> 45:10.203
Gimme that key!

45:15.629 --> 45:16.717
Anna!

45:17.821 --> 45:18.680
Anna!

45:20.583 --> 45:21.547
Daddy!

45:25.179 --> 45:26.354
Noooo!

45:34.837 --> 45:36.026
Reset it!

45:43.748 --> 45:44.937
I didn't mean to!

45:44.951 --> 45:46.955
You can bring her back,
she's not dead!

45:47.336 --> 45:49.345
There's an object that
can bring her back.

45:49.892 --> 45:51.204
I can take you to it.

46:43.248 --> 46:44.205
God, Anna.

46:51.722 --> 46:53.458
You know what this looks like?

46:54.353 --> 46:56.048
He's in the middle
of a custody battle.

46:56.252 --> 46:57.086
His ex said

46:57.087 --> 47:00.210
he missed their court appointment,
and now, he and Anna are gone.

47:00.247 --> 47:01.217
Joe wouldn't run.

47:01.737 --> 47:03.281
Then where did that
little girl go?

47:13.815 --> 47:15.557
We've got blood,
ladies and gentlemen

47:16.462 --> 47:17.515
Come on, Joe.

47:18.034 --> 47:18.963
Answer.

48:47.438 --> 48:49.379
- Destefano.
- Yeah, it's me.

48:50.760 --> 48:52.577
Holy God, you're okay.

48:53.527 --> 48:54.785
<i>Anna with you?</i>

48:56.015 --> 48:57.231
No, she's gone.

49:01.181 --> 49:02.138
Where is she?

49:04.840 --> 49:06.057
She went into the room.

49:07.956 --> 49:10.157
She went into the room,
and she's gone.

49:13.598 --> 49:15.798
Joe... you need to come home.

49:16.810 --> 49:19.612
We'll figure this thing out.
They're already thinking the worst.

49:19.817 --> 49:21.224
<i>They found blood on the door.</i>

49:23.609 --> 49:25.659
What about the body?
There was a burned body.

49:25.731 --> 49:28.806
We didn't find a body. They just want
to know what happened to Anna.

49:30.884 --> 49:32.428
Well, she's alive, Lou.

49:33.084 --> 49:35.271
Listen, I need you to do
a background check for me

49:35.272 --> 49:37.020
on a guy that Iggy called the weasel.

49:41.712 --> 49:42.477
Joe.

49:43.966 --> 49:44.773
I gotta go.

49:46.153 --> 49:46.837
Hello.

49:52.757 --> 49:53.905
Where'd you come from?

49:56.475 --> 49:57.281
What?

49:57.971 --> 49:59.420
Where were you
two minutes ago?

50:00.267 --> 50:01.018
Texas.

50:01.257 --> 50:04.237
Let this be a lesson
to you all, cowboy,

50:04.804 --> 50:08.705
that no man shall judge, tease,
or criticize another man.

50:08.883 --> 50:10.482
You can't be mean.

50:10.687 --> 50:12.755
You shouldn't be mean.
Being me--

50:15.063 --> 50:16.840
- Hi, Wally.
- Oh, hi.

50:21.037 --> 50:22.650
I suppose it's possible.

50:23.320 --> 50:24.468
There's a chance.

50:25.766 --> 50:27.543
A very small chance

50:27.544 --> 50:29.757
you can bring the kid
back out of this room.

50:31.135 --> 50:32.502
Well, tell me how
I can do it.

50:35.021 --> 50:35.773
Well...

50:38.145 --> 50:39.303
Sometimes...

50:40.942 --> 50:44.145
When you start getting
objects together,

50:45.464 --> 50:47.406
weird things happen.

50:48.833 --> 50:50.260
New things.

50:50.936 --> 50:52.344
New properties.

50:52.595 --> 50:54.196
Totally unpredictable.

50:55.402 --> 50:56.733
Take the watch.

50:57.080 --> 50:58.141
Useless, right?

50:58.411 --> 50:59.955
- The watch?
- Wristwatch.

51:00.110 --> 51:02.270
Cooks eggs.
Nothing else, just eggs.

51:02.483 --> 51:04.567
Put an egg in the middle,
hard-boils it.

51:04.586 --> 51:07.065
I don't know how somebody figured
that out, but they did.

51:07.219 --> 51:08.087
Anyway,

51:08.705 --> 51:12.061
nobody used to care much
about the watch until

51:12.467 --> 51:15.572
one day somebody found out
that if you put the watch

51:16.035 --> 51:19.199
and the knife together,

51:19.894 --> 51:20.974
you get a...

51:22.074 --> 51:23.926
kind of telepathy.

51:28.363 --> 51:30.659
So you're saying that
if I find the right object,

51:30.660 --> 51:33.376
- and I use it with the key...
- I don't know, Joe...

51:33.717 --> 51:34.855
it's a million to one.

51:39.099 --> 51:41.067
- I'll take it.
- Whatever you do,

51:41.337 --> 51:44.327
don't lose the key. If you lose it,
you'll never get her back.

52:11.375 --> 52:13.208
Cop's kid vanished.

52:14.790 --> 52:15.639
Him too.

52:21.138 --> 52:22.334
It's not right.

52:24.957 --> 52:28.140
We need to find the key
before the weasel.

52:29.684 --> 52:30.514
Before.

52:39.832 --> 52:40.584
Lou.

52:45.601 --> 52:48.109
I got a sample of Anna's blood
from the hospital,

52:48.611 --> 52:51.273
and I ran it against what we found
in the storage room.

52:51.659 --> 52:52.720
It's a match.

52:55.421 --> 52:58.063
You think you could lose
that report for a little while?

52:58.141 --> 52:58.778
Lou...

53:00.707 --> 53:03.716
- 24 hours, tops.
- Thanks, Marty.

53:06.899 --> 53:08.694
Ignacio's personal effects?

53:09.967 --> 53:10.623
Yeah.

53:22.527 --> 53:23.048
What?

53:23.221 --> 53:23.955
<i>Dr. Ruber,</i>

53:24.244 --> 53:27.601
<i>I compiled all the death certificates
for the burn victims, like you asked.</i>

53:27.794 --> 53:28.353
Yeah.

53:28.546 --> 53:31.421
<i>- But I ran into trouble on one of them.
- What's the problem?</i>

53:31.517 --> 53:34.237
<i>The burn case from 93.
He's still alive.</i>

53:34.410 --> 53:35.877
<i>His name is Milton Vrang.</i>

53:37.805 --> 53:39.947
- Is this a trick?
- No.

53:40.892 --> 53:41.857
Not at all.

53:42.474 --> 53:44.943
Whenever I talk about it,
they up my meds.

53:46.891 --> 53:48.049
You're safe.

53:50.865 --> 53:52.100
You can tell me anything.

53:53.874 --> 53:55.746
I'll tell you what
I used to believe.

53:56.691 --> 53:58.910
Not what I believe now,
because now...

53:59.218 --> 53:59.952
I'm healthy.

54:02.151 --> 54:03.386
What I used to believe is...

54:03.946 --> 54:05.045
is that there were

54:05.875 --> 54:07.032
these things

54:07.399 --> 54:08.961
spread throughout the world

54:09.811 --> 54:10.910
that looked like

54:11.624 --> 54:13.071
ordinary things,

54:13.476 --> 54:14.402
but weren't.

54:14.981 --> 54:16.679
But if you could find

54:17.180 --> 54:18.974
all these things,

54:19.534 --> 54:21.116
they would lead a path...

54:22.255 --> 54:24.628
and you could know
the mind of God.

54:28.448 --> 54:31.284
I used to believe
I belonged to a cabal,

54:31.632 --> 54:35.625
a group that was dedicated
to collecting all the objects

54:36.388 --> 54:38.278
for this holy purpose.

54:39.494 --> 54:41.983
But some of the objects...

54:43.817 --> 54:45.051
are full

54:45.727 --> 54:47.810
of holy... holy fire.

54:50.260 --> 54:51.977
So, you see, when I was...

54:53.423 --> 54:55.507
when I was touched with

54:57.301 --> 54:58.246
the pen...

55:00.716 --> 55:02.645
I burned. Burned!

55:05.038 --> 55:05.559
A pen?

55:06.678 --> 55:07.643
A ballpoint pen?

55:08.125 --> 55:10.710
- Did they send you to kill me?
- Who?

55:11.404 --> 55:13.083
- The order.
- No.

55:14.607 --> 55:15.668
Mr. Vrang,

55:16.537 --> 55:22.094
I need you to tell me
everything you know. Please.

55:23.617 --> 55:24.582
Please.

55:26.492 --> 55:28.035
Tell me about the key.

56:37.810 --> 56:38.857
What the hell.

57:08.836 --> 57:10.399
Took you long enough,
detective.

57:12.386 --> 57:13.890
Make sure you get
all of 'em.

57:14.199 --> 57:15.878
One of these radios
is an object.

57:16.322 --> 57:17.923
I'm trying to figure out
which one.

57:20.209 --> 57:21.501
By smashing it?

57:24.183 --> 57:25.727
You can't break an object.

57:26.730 --> 57:28.215
Haven't you learned
anything yet?

57:31.707 --> 57:33.038
Guess that's the one.

57:34.178 --> 57:37.731
Supposed to make you three inches taller,
if you tune it to the right station.

57:38.777 --> 57:39.722
Fascinating.

57:41.497 --> 57:42.751
So, who are you?

57:44.979 --> 57:46.108
Jennifer Bloom.

57:47.719 --> 57:50.825
One of the dead men in the pawn shop,
Marco Cordova,

57:51.501 --> 57:52.253
I knew him.

57:52.928 --> 57:53.951
He was my second.

57:55.436 --> 57:56.343
My partner.

57:56.671 --> 57:59.970
Former partner.
Went rogue about six months ago.

58:01.590 --> 58:02.728
He took the key.

58:04.272 --> 58:05.101
Joe,

58:06.085 --> 58:08.864
if I wanted, I could have killed you
the moment you walked in here.

58:09.134 --> 58:10.021
But I didn't.

58:12.414 --> 58:13.861
That's not what
we're about.

58:14.633 --> 58:16.427
Rule number one,
we don't kill.

58:17.372 --> 58:18.298
Ever.

58:20.738 --> 58:21.799
And who's "we"?

58:24.095 --> 58:25.214
We're called the legion.

58:26.564 --> 58:28.860
We're trying to get rid
of the objects.

58:28.937 --> 58:30.828
For good.
All of them.

58:32.141 --> 58:33.433
We track the owners,

58:33.761 --> 58:34.803
make contact,

58:34.996 --> 58:36.539
ask them to give us
their objects,

58:36.771 --> 58:37.813
join our cause.

58:38.623 --> 58:39.587
That ever work?

58:41.494 --> 58:43.034
I've had people beg me.

58:44.582 --> 58:45.264
Tell me,

58:46.987 --> 58:48.012
since you found the key,

58:48.816 --> 58:50.120
has your life gotten better,

58:51.019 --> 58:51.740
or worse?

58:55.948 --> 58:57.429
My daughter went
into the room.

59:00.825 --> 59:02.399
And I need the key
to bring her back.

59:04.221 --> 59:05.780
The legion can help you.

59:07.238 --> 59:08.048
Let us.

59:08.531 --> 59:09.724
How are you gonna help me?

59:10.190 --> 59:10.884
Join,

59:11.580 --> 59:13.013
and I'll tell you everything.

59:15.111 --> 59:15.728
Right.

59:16.191 --> 59:16.886
Joe,

59:17.581 --> 59:18.121
wait.

59:21.053 --> 59:21.671
Leave it.

59:38.842 --> 59:40.482
I think I'll skip nap time today.

59:50.863 --> 59:52.175
We need you, Joe.

59:52.854 --> 59:54.089
And you need us.

59:57.249 --> 59:58.769
I'm a friend
of Milton Vrang's,

59:58.770 --> 01:00:01.393
and I'm calling
about the order of

01:00:02.126 --> 01:00:03.380
the reunification.

01:00:03.998 --> 01:00:05.175
<i>I didn't order anything.</i>

01:00:17.753 --> 01:00:20.116
<i>The number you have dialed
has been disconnect...</i>

01:00:29.242 --> 01:00:30.612
- Hello?
- Hello.

01:00:30.882 --> 01:00:32.850
I'm a friend
of Milton vrang's.

01:00:33.082 --> 01:00:36.477
I'm calling about the order
of the reunification.

01:00:36.949 --> 01:00:37.547
<i>The order?</i>

01:00:39.746 --> 01:00:40.402
Yes.

01:00:40.768 --> 01:00:41.772
The new religion.

01:00:48.523 --> 01:00:49.217
Is that him?

01:00:54.986 --> 01:00:56.047
Yeah, that's him.

01:00:57.899 --> 01:01:00.194
I shouldn't even be here.
It'll just make you a target.

01:01:00.368 --> 01:01:01.236
Enough with that.

01:01:01.429 --> 01:01:03.166
We're in this thing
together all the way.

01:01:03.185 --> 01:01:05.133
All right? Whatever
the hell this thing is.

01:01:05.336 --> 01:01:06.069
Partners.

01:01:11.046 --> 01:01:12.146
What's his name?

01:01:15.812 --> 01:01:17.027
Howard Montague.

01:01:18.724 --> 01:01:19.438
The weasel.

01:01:20.364 --> 01:01:21.502
Howard Montague.

01:01:21.846 --> 01:01:24.103
We'll open an investigation,
make it official.

01:01:24.238 --> 01:01:25.704
Come on,
what would we even say?

01:01:25.859 --> 01:01:28.010
We don't say anything,
we just show 'em the key.

01:01:31.318 --> 01:01:32.534
I can't risk losing it.

01:01:33.691 --> 01:01:35.736
The key's my only shot
at bringing Anna back.

01:01:36.084 --> 01:01:38.533
Well, at least make a statement,
and clear your name.

01:01:39.248 --> 01:01:40.695
We'll look for Anna
together.

01:01:41.402 --> 01:01:42.463
Let me help you.

01:01:43.176 --> 01:01:44.160
Yeah, sure, Lou.

01:01:45.684 --> 01:01:46.475
All right.

01:01:48.695 --> 01:01:50.384
Now, we gotta talk
to Lee.

01:01:51.104 --> 01:01:51.931
She's smart.

01:01:53.225 --> 01:01:54.391
She won't flip out.

01:01:56.421 --> 01:01:58.229
At least I don't think she will.
Do you?

01:02:51.261 --> 01:02:53.899
Now, you know killing me won't
bring your little Anna back.

01:02:54.008 --> 01:02:55.796
Then you better tell me
what will.

01:02:55.914 --> 01:02:58.108
May I remind you you're
an officer of the law?

01:02:58.414 --> 01:02:59.362
Say that again.

01:02:59.698 --> 01:03:01.061
Say that again!

01:03:05.526 --> 01:03:06.514
If you lie to me,

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.470
you're dead.
Understand?

01:03:10.983 --> 01:03:13.202
Is there an object
that can bring her back?

01:03:13.839 --> 01:03:15.344
In concert with the key,

01:03:15.846 --> 01:03:17.003
- yes.
- What is it?

01:03:17.582 --> 01:03:20.321
- Tell me!
- Not unless you let me go.

01:03:23.890 --> 01:03:25.259
No deals.

01:03:25.472 --> 01:03:29.079
Listen, you ever want to see your kid
again, you will deal with me.

01:03:29.696 --> 01:03:32.668
I get you the object,
you give me the key. That's the deal.

01:03:34.867 --> 01:03:37.355
When I get my daughter back,
I'll give you the key.

01:03:39.343 --> 01:03:40.597
When she's safe.

01:03:42.487 --> 01:03:43.028
Deal.

01:03:52.423 --> 01:03:53.465
Give me the pen.

01:03:55.645 --> 01:03:56.552
It's mine.

01:03:56.989 --> 01:04:00.134
I don't want you sticking it in my ribs
the next time I turn around.

01:04:00.829 --> 01:04:02.063
Now, reach into
your pocket.

01:04:05.518 --> 01:04:06.116
Drop it.

01:04:14.566 --> 01:04:15.396
What else you got?

01:04:34.283 --> 01:04:35.517
Underpants too,
Montague.

01:04:35.614 --> 01:04:38.276
This is idiotic.
My underwear is not an object.

01:04:38.372 --> 01:04:40.379
Well, then, I'm sure
you wont' miss 'em.

01:05:00.887 --> 01:05:02.411
I hope you're proud
of yourself.

01:05:18.172 --> 01:05:20.313
Are any of those things
the object I'm looking for?

01:05:20.332 --> 01:05:20.680
No.

01:05:21.471 --> 01:05:22.377
Don't be stupid.

01:05:23.709 --> 01:05:24.133
Good.

01:05:26.930 --> 01:05:27.991
That's-- that's my--

01:05:40.995 --> 01:05:41.573
The pen.

01:05:42.384 --> 01:05:43.329
It's still there.

01:05:47.654 --> 01:05:48.638
And it moved.

01:05:51.387 --> 01:05:53.065
The object survived
the reset.

01:05:55.689 --> 01:05:57.483
Maybe that's where
it's supposed to go.

01:06:22.133 --> 01:06:23.329
You really read
this stuff?

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:25.220
I used to teach it
before I was

01:06:25.221 --> 01:06:27.322
unjustly terminated.
Come here, look.

01:06:27.843 --> 01:06:28.730
My masterpiece.

01:06:29.868 --> 01:06:31.508
It's a map of
all of the objects.

01:06:31.547 --> 01:06:32.974
Their relationship
to one another.

01:06:33.495 --> 01:06:34.055
You see...

01:06:35.859 --> 01:06:37.036
over here's the key.

01:06:37.865 --> 01:06:39.968
Pivotal object,
very powerful.

01:06:49.055 --> 01:06:49.923
What's this?

01:06:51.756 --> 01:06:53.010
The prime object.

01:06:53.588 --> 01:06:55.094
The one that connects
everything.

01:06:55.923 --> 01:06:59.045
They say that the prime object
controls all of the other objects.

01:07:00.728 --> 01:07:02.330
And it will bring
my daughter back.

01:07:03.178 --> 01:07:04.721
If you use it
with the key.

01:07:05.222 --> 01:07:06.206
Yes.

01:07:09.659 --> 01:07:10.470
What is it?

01:07:18.515 --> 01:07:19.480
The clock.

01:07:25.479 --> 01:07:27.269
You're sure Kreutzfeld
has the clock?

01:07:27.949 --> 01:07:28.836
Oh, yeah.

01:07:30.322 --> 01:07:31.904
He's an object collector.

01:07:33.537 --> 01:07:36.007
He uses the pawn shops
to comb for objects.

01:07:36.644 --> 01:07:39.659
Keeps everything up on the third floor,
but security is tight.

01:07:40.753 --> 01:07:42.605
Why does he need
so much protection?

01:07:44.612 --> 01:07:47.409
Maybe he's afraid someone's
gonna try to steal the clock.

01:08:06.189 --> 01:08:09.411
Corner of Smithfield and Liberty
4:30 PM. Thursday.

01:08:18.609 --> 01:08:20.231
Thank you. Just keep
the change.

01:08:27.138 --> 01:08:29.068
<i>Did you see that
blue car go by?</i>

01:08:30.533 --> 01:08:31.518
<i>Was it pretty?</i>

01:08:32.772 --> 01:08:35.203
Stop making phone calls
if you want to live.

01:08:36.413 --> 01:08:38.483
- I have questions.
- Bring us an object.

01:08:38.729 --> 01:08:39.906
You'll get answers.

01:08:46.926 --> 01:08:50.260
Kreutzfeld converted this place
to be the most anti-key house

01:08:50.261 --> 01:08:53.225
you could ever think of.
See, he pulled a permit in '96.

01:08:54.634 --> 01:08:57.301
The front door is a sliding door,
no pintumbler lock.

01:08:57.301 --> 01:08:59.917
- The key won't work.
- Every door in this house slides.

01:08:59.919 --> 01:09:01.058
Even the closets.

01:09:01.276 --> 01:09:02.858
Can't get inside
with the key.

01:09:02.895 --> 01:09:03.880
This area here,

01:09:04.169 --> 01:09:06.099
it's bulletproof glass,
three layers thick.

01:09:06.140 --> 01:09:08.559
You see these doors?
They all have electronic locks.

01:09:08.560 --> 01:09:10.229
You need a pass card
to get through 'em.

01:09:10.234 --> 01:09:13.662
- So, once the alarm system is triggered...
- You're sealed in. Sitting ducks.

01:09:13.673 --> 01:09:16.370
You realize now why
I've never attempted this.

01:09:16.508 --> 01:09:19.343
Let's check the original plans
against these revised plans.

01:09:29.122 --> 01:09:30.515
Where did this door go?

01:09:31.283 --> 01:09:34.229
There were two doors going into
this room, and now there's only one.

01:09:38.219 --> 01:09:39.276
There's a wall.

01:09:42.428 --> 01:09:43.643
He got rid of it,
I guess.

01:09:43.988 --> 01:09:45.430
Made it more secure
that way.

01:09:46.279 --> 01:09:47.455
I know how
we're getting in.

01:09:49.773 --> 01:09:52.374
There are lots of guards.
You're gonna have to shoot 'em all.

01:09:52.375 --> 01:09:53.984
How many bullets
do you have?

01:09:54.637 --> 01:09:56.583
If I shoot anybody,
it's gonna be you.

01:09:58.756 --> 01:10:00.232
That's not
very collaborative.

01:10:03.257 --> 01:10:05.605
What's the most powerful
object you can think of?

01:10:05.783 --> 01:10:06.573
The key.

01:10:07.847 --> 01:10:09.637
No, I mean dangerous,
like a weapon.

01:10:11.038 --> 01:10:11.838
The eye.

01:10:13.063 --> 01:10:14.406
The glass eye.

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:16.698
Nobody's seen it in years.
You'll never find it.

01:10:18.004 --> 01:10:19.170
What does the eye do?

01:10:21.367 --> 01:10:22.158
Well,

01:10:23.836 --> 01:10:24.974
to tell you the truth...

01:10:25.386 --> 01:10:26.524
- Shut up.
- All right.

01:10:29.379 --> 01:10:30.788
Get a message
to your boss.

01:10:31.714 --> 01:10:33.662
Tell Kreutzfeld
I have a present for him.

01:10:33.971 --> 01:10:34.685
The weasel.

01:10:35.305 --> 01:10:36.482
I want to make a trade.

01:10:36.483 --> 01:10:39.260
Meet me out front, and don't try
anything funny. I have the eye.

01:10:39.338 --> 01:10:40.322
You son of a...

01:10:40.804 --> 01:10:41.585
Will you shut up?

01:10:41.604 --> 01:10:43.476
I'm not gonna give you
over to Kreutzfeld.

01:10:44.945 --> 01:10:46.530
I'm just trying to clear the house.

01:10:46.531 --> 01:10:48.210
How are we supposed
to get in there now?

01:10:48.211 --> 01:10:49.087
With the key.

01:10:49.561 --> 01:10:51.584
There are no viable doors
in that house.

01:10:52.877 --> 01:10:53.445
There's one.

01:11:08.403 --> 01:11:09.428
Close the door.

01:11:10.785 --> 01:11:11.896
It's our only way out.

01:11:12.353 --> 01:11:15.156
We're never gonna make it
back downstairs. Now close it.

01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:24.262
<i>I want the entire
building secured.</i>

01:11:48.559 --> 01:11:50.353
Protect the upstairs.

01:12:04.996 --> 01:12:06.655
Back to bed, kiddo.

01:12:09.655 --> 01:12:10.446
Okay?

01:12:36.528 --> 01:12:37.261
Easy.

01:12:38.303 --> 01:12:39.499
Hands out to your sides.

01:12:41.930 --> 01:12:43.184
Get his access card.

01:12:55.721 --> 01:12:57.206
What's the code?

01:12:59.965 --> 01:13:01.470
What's the code?

01:13:25.142 --> 01:13:25.798
Stay.

01:13:50.937 --> 01:13:53.194
Anthony, have you
secured upstairs?

01:13:55.894 --> 01:13:56.898
Anthony?

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:00.235
They're upstairs.

01:14:18.465 --> 01:14:19.797
Dormant objects.

01:14:20.067 --> 01:14:22.320
Their properties haven't
been discovered yet.

01:14:25.276 --> 01:14:26.433
Where's the clock?

01:14:36.824 --> 01:14:39.525
Well, you didn't think he'd leave
it out in the open, did you?

01:14:40.624 --> 01:14:42.129
Hand me the ax.

01:14:42.302 --> 01:14:42.707
But...

01:14:43.517 --> 01:14:44.482
you gotta be kidding.

01:14:45.466 --> 01:14:47.858
You can't expect
to open a safe with an ax.

01:15:07.970 --> 01:15:08.858
The door...

01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:10.633
It's still here?

01:15:12.244 --> 01:15:14.424
- Sometimes they build over 'em.
- Sometimes?

01:15:29.367 --> 01:15:31.258
- Open it.
- I can't!

01:15:34.151 --> 01:15:35.193
Break it down.

01:15:35.309 --> 01:15:37.663
- It's bulletproof.
- Break it down!

01:15:44.859 --> 01:15:46.306
Look out, look out!

01:15:53.232 --> 01:15:54.254
Hurry up.

01:15:56.010 --> 01:15:56.570
Joe...

01:15:57.614 --> 01:15:58.791
we got a problem.

01:16:00.451 --> 01:16:01.319
There's no knob,

01:16:01.434 --> 01:16:03.614
there's no lock.
We can't use the key.

01:16:08.844 --> 01:16:09.577
come on!

01:16:14.747 --> 01:16:17.081
- What the hell are you doing?
- Check the bag.

01:16:18.380 --> 01:16:19.576
A door knob?

01:16:23.648 --> 01:16:25.075
This is your plan, huh?

01:16:25.345 --> 01:16:26.387
You're remodeling.

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.027
Plug it in.

01:16:30.866 --> 01:16:32.409
Couldn't get
cordless, huh?

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:35.342
- Shut up and plug it in.
- All right.

01:16:36.094 --> 01:16:37.788
Kill the power
in the study.

01:16:57.910 --> 01:16:59.280
Gimme that light
over here.

01:16:59.887 --> 01:17:00.987
Is that knob
gonna work?

01:17:01.199 --> 01:17:02.492
I mean, does
that count?

01:17:06.022 --> 01:17:07.450
Now the next one!

01:17:09.359 --> 01:17:10.189
Hurry it up.

01:17:11.366 --> 01:17:12.118
Come on!

01:17:14.646 --> 01:17:16.343
- Light. I need light.
- Right!

01:17:18.098 --> 01:17:19.892
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

01:17:28.766 --> 01:17:30.271
Come on.

01:17:36.117 --> 01:17:37.583
Oh, my God.

01:17:41.096 --> 01:17:42.735
Not without the clock.

01:17:44.336 --> 01:17:45.263
Come on!

01:17:46.111 --> 01:17:48.156
- Hurry up!
- Don't stop! Come on!

01:17:51.370 --> 01:17:52.566
Detective Miller,

01:17:53.357 --> 01:17:57.042
there are events in motion that are far
greater than you could understand.

01:17:57.043 --> 01:17:58.026
I will help you.

01:17:58.477 --> 01:18:01.892
I will get you anything you want,
but I must have that key.

01:18:04.265 --> 01:18:05.499
<i>Now get in there!</i>

01:18:11.399 --> 01:18:12.268
Get 'em!

01:18:23.572 --> 01:18:24.479
Look out.

01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:45.855
I used to know
a safecracker.

01:18:46.029 --> 01:18:47.881
It's possible
I could look him...

01:18:58.874 --> 01:18:59.896
There it is.

01:19:17.201 --> 01:19:18.359
There it is.

01:19:20.674 --> 01:19:21.908
Now what do I do?

01:19:24.011 --> 01:19:26.114
To bring my daughter back,
what do I do?

01:19:26.770 --> 01:19:27.870
Open it?

01:19:33.773 --> 01:19:36.223
You better know what the hell
you're talking about.

01:19:55.978 --> 01:19:57.560
Please,
bring my daughter back.

01:20:03.308 --> 01:20:05.411
Please,
bring my daughter back.

01:20:10.601 --> 01:20:12.029
This can't be.
It's impossible.

01:20:12.048 --> 01:20:14.865
It's a prime object!
It's the clock! It has to be.

01:20:15.193 --> 01:20:16.601
I'm right.
I'm always right.

01:20:16.679 --> 01:20:17.855
Look, we had a deal.

01:20:18.469 --> 01:20:21.672
- I get you that clock, you give me the key.
- When my daughter is safe.

01:20:29.485 --> 01:20:32.051
It doesn't work
in the room.

01:20:44.273 --> 01:20:44.949
Hello.

01:20:49.530 --> 01:20:51.634
We'll bring you in,
we'll show 'em the key.

01:20:51.673 --> 01:20:53.259
We'll blow the whole thing wide open.

01:20:53.260 --> 01:20:55.259
There won't be a case
against you after this.

01:20:56.255 --> 01:20:57.539
And then we'll
get Anna back.

01:20:57.717 --> 01:20:59.406
Whatever it takes,
I promise.

01:21:04.404 --> 01:21:05.105
Destefano.

01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:07.733
Hi, Lou, it's Martin.

01:21:08.089 --> 01:21:08.582
<i>Ruby!</i>

01:21:09.006 --> 01:21:10.863
What sweet wind blows
in my direction?

01:21:12.314 --> 01:21:15.478
I need to see you and Joe Miller.
It's important.

01:21:17.157 --> 01:21:18.662
It's about the key.

01:21:20.533 --> 01:21:23.273
This isn't just a random
collection of things.

01:21:23.274 --> 01:21:24.990
There is something
going on.

01:21:27.112 --> 01:21:29.832
Some people think
that these things are...

01:21:29.833 --> 01:21:31.993
a way to communicate
with God.

01:21:33.324 --> 01:21:36.160
Some say the objects
are God.

01:21:37.549 --> 01:21:38.302
Come on.

01:21:38.475 --> 01:21:40.115
I'm not saying
I believe that.

01:21:40.231 --> 01:21:42.469
I don't know what I believe.
It's just...

01:21:47.524 --> 01:21:48.971
Can I see the key?

01:21:50.129 --> 01:21:50.920
Please?

01:21:52.367 --> 01:21:55.300
I just have to know
if it's real.

01:22:21.959 --> 01:22:23.078
I've been waiting

01:22:23.503 --> 01:22:24.892
all my life...

01:22:25.606 --> 01:22:26.818
for something,

01:22:27.917 --> 01:22:29.094
it's this.

01:22:30.290 --> 01:22:31.544
We can't tell anyone.

01:22:31.756 --> 01:22:33.319
Rube, we gotta clear Joe.

01:22:33.590 --> 01:22:36.349
They'll put him away for kidnapping.
Or worse, murder.

01:22:37.101 --> 01:22:38.529
We have to show them
the key.

01:22:38.664 --> 01:22:40.690
I've gotta save
my daughter, Ruber.

01:22:40.728 --> 01:22:42.619
And Lou's right,
I can't do it alone.

01:22:43.710 --> 01:22:46.372
- I don't have any other choice.
- Your daughter

01:22:46.468 --> 01:22:49.787
is gone, and I'm
so sorry for you.

01:22:50.192 --> 01:22:51.716
But you can't
bring her back.

01:22:53.068 --> 01:22:56.252
We have to keep
the key to ourselves.

01:22:57.139 --> 01:22:59.396
We have to use this.

01:23:01.026 --> 01:23:02.194
I've made my decision.

01:23:18.509 --> 01:23:19.030
Marty!

01:23:19.725 --> 01:23:20.863
Give me the key, Joe.

01:23:22.927 --> 01:23:24.991
Rube, come on.
This is crazy.

01:23:26.188 --> 01:23:27.886
Whose side are you on?

01:23:32.478 --> 01:23:33.501
My side.

01:23:35.970 --> 01:23:36.607
Lou!

01:23:40.466 --> 01:23:40.967
Lou!

01:23:41.642 --> 01:23:42.317
Lou!

01:23:47.102 --> 01:23:47.526
Lou.

01:23:48.549 --> 01:23:50.285
Don't make me
shoot you too.

01:23:51.269 --> 01:23:52.812
Give me the key, Joe.

01:23:56.883 --> 01:23:57.519
Okay.

01:23:59.265 --> 01:24:00.481
Just take it easy.

01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.728
You want the key, Ruber?

01:24:33.372 --> 01:24:34.086
Oh, my god.

01:24:38.195 --> 01:24:39.025
Helen, wait!

01:25:16.569 --> 01:25:17.340
Helen?

01:25:20.484 --> 01:25:21.256
It's okay.

01:25:40.105 --> 01:25:42.131
Yes, I need to report
a murder.

01:25:43.405 --> 01:25:45.025
Detective Joe Miller

01:25:45.643 --> 01:25:46.163
just...

01:25:46.395 --> 01:25:48.826
shot Lou Destefano,
his partner.
