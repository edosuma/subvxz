00:10.177 --> 00:12.847
WJLM

00:14.932 --> 00:17.935
Hotlanta, home of the Hawks,
the Atlanta Stomp,

00:18.227 --> 00:20.521
and that fine-ass Michael Vick!

00:20.813 --> 00:24.650
Michael, if you out there listenin',
come on over to WJLM

00:24.942 --> 00:27.236
and touch down
on a sisters backside.

00:27.528 --> 00:31.407
Your girl Helen's got an end zone
you wouldn't believe, baby!

00:31.699 --> 00:32.992
Holler at your girl!

00:34.660 --> 00:36.954
Call me anytime

00:37.246 --> 00:41.208
Call me if you need
someone to talk to

00:41.500 --> 00:45.463
Call me,
satisfaction guaranteed

00:47.256 --> 00:49.925
- Darnelle, you see my blue sweater?
- Leave me alone.

00:50.217 --> 00:52.595
Darnelle, I know
you be dippin' in my closet

00:52.887 --> 00:54.555
and I'm not going anywhere until--

00:55.765 --> 00:58.517
- Leave me alone.
- You missed.

01:02.813 --> 01:03.856
Hey, Nana.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.151
Look at you!

01:07.443 --> 01:10.362
- Come on, sit down, baby.
- No, thanks. I'm late.

01:10.654 --> 01:12.114
Nana, have you seen
my blue sweater?

01:12.406 --> 01:13.491
I ain't seen it.

01:13.783 --> 01:16.118
- Go ask your mama.
- Mama!

01:16.410 --> 01:18.120
Stop screaming.
I'm back here.

01:18.412 --> 01:21.624
Satisfaction guaranteed

01:21.916 --> 01:22.958
You almost ready, baby girl?
We gotta go.

01:23.250 --> 01:24.543
I can't find my blue sweater.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.670
That's because it's in the truck
where you left it,

01:26.962 --> 01:28.589
where you
pretty much leave everything.

01:28.881 --> 01:30.341
Okay, I guess I'm ready.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.468
You ain't strollin' up in school
with that pimp hat on.

01:32.760 --> 01:37.181
Mom, it's not a pimp hat, it's fashion.
Alicia Keys has the same one.

01:37.473 --> 01:39.141
Well, good for her.
Lose the hat.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.810
Why send me
to a performing arts school

01:41.102 --> 01:44.355
if you're not gonna allow me
to be creative or express myself?

01:44.647 --> 01:46.607
Sounds
like a contradiction to me.

01:46.899 --> 01:48.734
"Sounds
like a contradiction to me."

01:49.026 --> 01:52.655
Lose the hat and the attitude.
I'll meet you in the car. Go ahead.

01:55.825 --> 01:57.701
- Vanessa!
- Yeah?

01:57.993 --> 02:00.454
Do you think these pants
make my butt look big?

02:00.746 --> 02:03.249
- Yeah, they do.
- Perfect.

02:04.750 --> 02:08.586
Call me if you need
someone to talk to

02:08.878 --> 02:11.632
I'm gonna get the hell out of here.
I'll mess with it at the shop.

02:24.478 --> 02:26.772
- I see my blue sweater.
- Yep.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.249
Hi!

02:47.877 --> 02:49.044
Told you.

02:50.129 --> 02:51.255
Go ahead, get out.

02:52.131 --> 02:54.300
Wait.
Fly me some fingers.

02:56.343 --> 02:58.929
- All right, have a good day. Love you.
- Love you, too.

03:01.849 --> 03:04.143
Can't believe it.
She was right.

03:05.519 --> 03:08.731
Hollering with Helen
in the morning

03:09.023 --> 03:10.649
Hotlanta, how y'all is?

03:10.941 --> 03:12.902
I hope y'all feeling somethin' like me.

03:13.194 --> 03:15.613
I reckon y'all checkin'
my good mood this mornin',

03:15.905 --> 03:19.116
'cause your girl Helen
is doin' quite well, thank you very much.

03:19.408 --> 03:22.578
See, one of my many mens-es
came through last night

03:22.870 --> 03:25.372
and got crunk with my trunk,
if you know what I'm sayin'.

03:25.664 --> 03:26.957
Yeah, he got a sister smilin'

03:27.249 --> 03:29.627
like she just got
a thousand-dollar credit increase

03:29.919 --> 03:33.047
on her gas card
and ready to get pumped!

03:34.173 --> 03:38.802
Y'all know I ain't lyin' to you.
Just keepin' it real, for real, for real.

03:40.012 --> 03:42.640
Holler at your girl Helen.
I'll holler.

03:43.098 --> 03:44.808
Don't even worry about it.
I'll get the hair.

03:45.100 --> 03:46.977
You just come on in and we--
Yeah, we'll see you at 10:00.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.437
All right, bye-bye.

03:51.106 --> 03:55.277
No, no, I can't go.
I have my consultation later.

03:56.278 --> 03:57.947
Finally getting those implants.

03:59.031 --> 04:00.032
Dr. Kopelin says it'll take
like a week or so to recover,

04:00.324 --> 04:01.617
Dr. Kopelin says it'll take
like a week or so to recover,

04:01.909 --> 04:05.454
but I'll be so doped up
on Vicodin, who cares?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.665
Okay, I'll talk to you later.

04:09.124 --> 04:12.962
Joanne, Joanne, girl,
I'm telling you, don't do it.

04:13.254 --> 04:15.464
Or you know what? You'll be going
hot and heavy with your boyfriend,

04:15.756 --> 04:18.091
he squeeze too hard,
that thing fly right out your mouth.

04:19.134 --> 04:21.178
Besides, you don't need that, girl.
Do you know why?

04:21.470 --> 04:24.682
- Why?
- Because you are beautiful.

04:24.974 --> 04:29.144
- Oh, my God, Gina! It's amazing.
- Well, you know.

04:29.436 --> 04:31.814
You just have to give me a bottle
of that special conditioner you make.

04:32.106 --> 04:33.732
Hey, you gotta keep that on the low,

04:34.024 --> 04:36.610
because Jorge only likes us
using Jorge products.

04:36.902 --> 04:37.778
Oh, forget about Jorge.

04:38.070 --> 04:40.614
I swear, you're the best thing
that ever happened to him.

04:40.906 --> 04:45.494
Is she now? I thought the best thing
to ever happen to Jorge's was Jorge.

04:45.786 --> 04:49.373
My God, Joanne, you look fantastic.
You look incredible.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.001
So, when you getting the implants?

04:52.293 --> 04:54.044
Soon.

04:54.336 --> 04:56.255
Jorge, you have a gem
on your hands.

04:56.547 --> 05:00.676
- Gina is a miracle worker.
- Yeah. She's a...worker.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.972
Sweetie, I gotta run.

05:05.264 --> 05:08.600
I got some crew's feet screaming
for some Botox, so next week?

05:08.892 --> 05:10.019
I'll be here.

05:13.605 --> 05:15.149
Great to see you, baby.

05:16.567 --> 05:18.027
So, Gina, nice work.

05:18.319 --> 05:20.696
Thanks. Just doing what I do.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.575
Well, about that, just remember
that in doing what you do,

05:24.867 --> 05:27.119
you're actually doing what I do,
what Jorge does,

05:27.411 --> 05:29.163
the person whose name
is on the moniker, ja?

05:30.205 --> 05:31.790
...My nigga"? What?

05:33.834 --> 05:37.546
"Moniker."
As in the name on the building.

05:38.630 --> 05:41.383
So, that being said,
you just have a marvelous day, ja?

05:42.843 --> 05:44.970
You need to learn
how to pronounce that correctly.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.556
Jorge's time of the month again?

05:48.766 --> 05:50.434
Let's go get some lunch.

05:51.894 --> 05:53.187
I could use some air, anyway.

05:53.479 --> 05:55.773
You got a dictionary?
I gotta look up this word: "ma-nigga."

05:56.065 --> 05:57.399
- "Moniker"?
- "Ma-nigga."

05:57.691 --> 05:59.693
- "Ma-nigger"?
- That's what I thought he said.

05:59.985 --> 06:01.612
- You said, "My nigga"?
- "My nigger"?

06:01.904 --> 06:02.863
- Don't you ever say that again.
- What?

06:03.155 --> 06:04.531
You know, you whites,
you can't really say that word,

06:04.823 --> 06:06.658
but that's what I thought Jorge said!

06:06.950 --> 06:09.661
The guy can do some hair.
Well, he can work a flip.

06:09.953 --> 06:13.040
- But he's a idiot to work for.
- At least you got a chair.

06:13.332 --> 06:16.335
- I'm stuck in shampoo hell.
- Girl, you'll get out.

06:16.627 --> 06:18.962
Oh, dear God, let it be soon!

06:19.254 --> 06:21.131
I've been dying
to show you something.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.051
Pictures from a hair show
I worked last weekend.

06:25.427 --> 06:26.470
Those are my models.

06:27.638 --> 06:28.722
What?

06:31.266 --> 06:32.684
You did this?

06:33.852 --> 06:37.773
Girl, this is good.
Jorge is trippin' not giving you a chair.

06:38.065 --> 06:41.235
Well, if it means anything to you,
you always got a chair in my shop.

06:41.527 --> 06:43.987
- Why, thank you.
- Well, when I get a shop.

06:45.489 --> 06:47.699
What do you want a shop for?
Too much of a headache.

06:47.991 --> 06:51.286
I always wanted my own shop.
Shoot, sell my own products.

06:52.371 --> 06:55.290
Vanessa getting accepted
into that expensive-ass music school

06:55.582 --> 06:58.127
just moved it
from Chicago to here.

06:58.419 --> 07:00.421
- But it'll happen.
- Yes, it will.

07:00.712 --> 07:04.675
Until then, I'm just gonna kick back,
stack my chips at Jorge's...

07:04.967 --> 07:06.844
And try not to kill him.

07:27.448 --> 07:31.535
- She can play, can't she?
- Yeah, just like her daddy.

07:32.536 --> 07:34.037
Rest his soul.

07:35.581 --> 07:38.959
She don't have the same passion
for it since he died, though.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.545
But still, all I got to do
is hear her play

07:41.837 --> 07:44.423
to know why I put up
with Jorge's nonsense.

07:44.715 --> 07:46.467
I want my daughter
to have the best, you know'?

07:46.758 --> 07:48.969
Hell, at this point,
all I want from my daughter

07:49.261 --> 07:52.139
is some common sense
and some clothes that fit.

07:52.431 --> 07:54.391
Gina, the girl put on a pair of pants

07:54.683 --> 07:57.102
that came down
to the top of her burning bush.

07:58.145 --> 08:01.732
Sometimes that girl
make me mad enough to chew bricks.

08:02.024 --> 08:04.026
Don't mess
your dental work up over it.

08:04.318 --> 08:07.446
- I don't know.
- She gonna be all right.

08:21.877 --> 08:23.337
You look absolutely fantastic.

08:23.629 --> 08:25.797
We going to make another appointment,
touch up the roots, ja?

08:26.089 --> 08:28.509
- Ja. Thank you, Jorge.
- Great to see you.

08:37.893 --> 08:39.019
Don't be afraid to hop on top.

08:39.311 --> 08:43.565
Listen, a man like a lady in the streets
and a freak in the bedroom.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.151
You know, you got,
what, seven kids? I'm telling you--

08:47.027 --> 08:48.737
Terri is here.
I must go to Pilates.

08:49.029 --> 08:51.156
Please make sure
that she's taken care of, ja?

08:51.448 --> 08:53.116
Okay, soon as I square away
Mrs. Dexter.

08:53.408 --> 08:54.243
Pronto, Gina.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.704
Fine, Jorge. Right away.

09:02.543 --> 09:05.003
You might want to find a frame
for your memories.

09:05.295 --> 09:07.172
Preferably not one from K-Mart.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.425
Jorge's was not named
Best Designed Salon in Atlanta

09:10.717 --> 09:12.928
for having Scottish tape
on some mirrors, right? Ja?

09:13.220 --> 09:14.638
Okay, I go now.

09:18.475 --> 09:21.728
Hey, Terri. How you doin'?
Come on, get comfortable.

09:26.692 --> 09:30.404
I'm having this major party
for Steven and a few of his clients.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.615
And I just have to look remarkable.
I just have to.

09:33.907 --> 09:35.909
So I was hoping that, you know,

09:36.201 --> 09:37.744
you would do a little
of your magic on me.

09:38.036 --> 09:40.080
I think I can conjure up
somethin' for you.

09:40.372 --> 09:43.292
You know what?
Lynn, I got this.

09:43.584 --> 09:46.044
Why don't you go finish
setting Mrs. Dexter for me?

09:47.754 --> 09:51.174
I don't know. I was just supposed
to shampoo till an available chair opens.

09:51.466 --> 09:53.218
Well, do you see me at my chair?

09:53.510 --> 09:54.344
No.

09:54.636 --> 09:57.598
Then it's open.
Go ahead, girl, do your thing.

10:00.726 --> 10:01.852
Come on back.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.355
- So tell me about this dinner party.
- Big, big party.

10:05.647 --> 10:07.566
But, don't worry,
I've got everything under control.

10:07.858 --> 10:12.070
I have caterers,
the kids all have play dates...

10:12.362 --> 10:13.614
- Well, that's good to hear.
- Life is good.

10:13.905 --> 10:15.490
You know,
life is just really, really good.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.367
You havin' problems with Steven again?

10:17.659 --> 10:20.287
Yeah, I am.

10:20.579 --> 10:24.249
He just looks at me
like he hates me.

10:24.541 --> 10:25.542
- He does.
- Come on, now.

10:25.834 --> 10:27.628
He doesn't hate you.
Don't even worry about it.

10:27.919 --> 10:30.881
I got my special conditioner
to take care of that, so...

10:31.173 --> 10:33.091
You know, I just don't know what to do.
I try to please him.

10:33.383 --> 10:35.260
I do everything.
I've bought sex toys.

10:35.552 --> 10:36.637
Did you get any
of them Chinese balls?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.972
- Do you think that'll work?
- Oh, man.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.807
That's the move right there.

10:41.099 --> 10:43.602
I mean, I hear
they make men go crazy.

10:43.894 --> 10:46.229
You just sneak 'em up in there
and then go...

10:47.939 --> 10:49.483
I don't know about that!

10:53.445 --> 10:55.781
- ...out.
- Shampooer.

10:58.659 --> 10:59.576
I guess.

10:59.868 --> 11:02.954
So don't forget you gotta drink
a lot of water, take those vitamins,

11:03.246 --> 11:04.247
and come on back next week.

11:04.539 --> 11:05.791
Let me give you
another treatment, okay?

11:06.083 --> 11:08.001
Thank you, Gina.
Your cream has just saved my hair.

11:08.293 --> 11:09.086
- Oh, Terri, come on.
- Thank you.

11:09.378 --> 11:10.504
Take care now. Have fun!

11:10.796 --> 11:12.547
- You're so sweet!
- Don't stress!

11:12.839 --> 11:15.676
Hello, shampooing girl.
Have you gone cuckoo clock in the head?

11:15.967 --> 11:18.220
I don't remember saying
you could leave the shampooing area.

11:18.512 --> 11:21.264
You are the shampooing girl.
You should be shampooing, no?

11:21.556 --> 11:24.935
Lynn! Girl, you got
some skills on you!

11:25.227 --> 11:26.603
Look at this. This is great!

11:31.358 --> 11:34.152
- I hope I didn't get her in trouble.
- I hope not.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.572
So, this is not the way
we do things here at Jorge's, ja?

11:37.864 --> 11:39.825
Look, I know
it wasn't proper protocol,

11:40.117 --> 11:42.744
but you were gone,
and I was busy and Lynn...

11:43.704 --> 11:46.873
Look, Lynn has her license.
So I just told her to take a shot.

11:47.165 --> 11:49.876
So you told her to take a shot.

11:50.168 --> 11:52.379
Yeah.
And she dunked it.

11:53.463 --> 11:55.257
I don't care
if she dunked it, alley-coped it,

11:55.549 --> 11:58.677
touch-downed it, or any
of your other little street colloquialisms.

11:58.969 --> 12:01.513
You don't get to give shots
here at Jorge's, okay?

12:01.805 --> 12:04.933
I give the shots...
unless you're diabetic.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.729
Right? The stylists here, they work
for me, they don't work for you.

12:09.020 --> 12:10.731
So if you wish
to continue working here,

12:11.022 --> 12:12.774
I suggest that you
get with the program

12:13.066 --> 12:14.568
and you give me
some proper respect, ja?

12:14.860 --> 12:17.612
I showed you the proper respect
when I took care of your client

12:17.904 --> 12:19.698
while you took a Pilates class.

12:19.990 --> 12:21.491
So you wish to altercate with me?

12:21.783 --> 12:24.453
You have no idea
what I wish to do with you.

12:24.745 --> 12:26.288
You know, you act
like you own me or something.

12:26.580 --> 12:29.291
Gina, Gina, of course I do.

12:29.958 --> 12:32.210
Without me, you would be
back in Chicago, baby,

12:32.502 --> 12:34.296
washing hair
in your mama's kitchen.

12:34.588 --> 12:35.881
Now you wanna talk
about my mama?

12:36.173 --> 12:38.008
So do I own you?

12:38.300 --> 12:40.552
Technically,
as in "have papers on you"? No.

12:40.844 --> 12:42.053
Get your fingers out my face.

12:42.345 --> 12:45.307
I've given you the lifestyle
that you have grown accustomed to.

12:45.599 --> 12:46.892
Get your fingers out my face.

12:47.184 --> 12:51.480
And, like all things, what Jorge giveth,
Jorge can also taketh away.

12:51.772 --> 12:54.399
You know what, Jorge?
I don't need a damn thing from you.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.567
You hear me?

12:55.859 --> 12:58.320
And you cannot "taketh"
anything away from me.

12:58.612 --> 13:01.865
You know, matter of fact,
I giveth it back. I quit.

13:02.157 --> 13:03.992
- Oh, you quit?
- Yeah. I don't need this.

13:04.284 --> 13:06.328
Shoot. I quit.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.831
Outta here.
Snatch my picture off the wall.

13:10.123 --> 13:13.418
Everybody knows I am the shit
all up and through Jorge's.

13:13.710 --> 13:15.420
And what's up
with the K-Mart thing, huh?

13:15.712 --> 13:16.755
Is it 'cause I'm black?

13:17.047 --> 13:19.758
Is it 'cause I'm black?
'Cause I'm black?!

13:20.050 --> 13:23.303
Let me tell you something, baby.
You're nothing without me.

13:23.595 --> 13:25.889
You're going to fall flat on your ass,
I promise you that.

13:26.181 --> 13:27.098
Well, I got a little cushion.

13:27.390 --> 13:29.434
You wanna kiss it?
I didn't think so!

13:51.248 --> 13:53.917
- What you doin' up?
- Can't sleep.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.550
I miss him.

14:03.176 --> 14:06.179
- So do I.
- Wait a minute.

14:06.471 --> 14:09.057
Does this mean I'm gonna have
to leave music school now?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.059
No. Why would you
say that, Vanessa?

14:11.351 --> 14:14.104
Because, Mom...you got fired.

14:14.396 --> 14:17.482
No. I quit.
There's a difference.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.944
Please. If I wanted to go get
a job tomorrow at a shop, I could.

14:21.236 --> 14:25.198
But that's not where my heart is.
It's time I owned somethin'.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.419
I can't approve this,
not for this much.

14:37.711 --> 14:40.380
But didn't you read my business plan
or my letters of recommendation?

14:40.672 --> 14:43.383
All very impressive, but...

14:47.971 --> 14:48.847
But...

14:49.139 --> 14:52.976
Miss Norris, see, you're
missing what we like to call here

14:53.268 --> 14:56.354
at Southern Mutual
and Savings "the three C's."

14:56.646 --> 14:58.315
- Credit, collateral--
- Color.

14:59.149 --> 15:00.317
No. I was gonna say capital,

15:00.609 --> 15:02.402
which is something
that you could earn

15:02.694 --> 15:05.030
by acquiring
one of our secured credit cards,

15:05.322 --> 15:08.533
as opposed to you
throwing around your...race one.

15:10.994 --> 15:15.582
And that's my lunch calling me,
but nature's calling me first.

15:15.874 --> 15:18.335
So, Miss Norris,
good day to you.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.112
Don't kill me.

15:48.615 --> 15:52.160
Stay still, now, or I'ma mess around
and take your eye out.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.411
Relax, woman.

15:54.537 --> 15:56.623
There. Okay, okay.

15:56.915 --> 15:58.249
Let me get a look at you.
All right.

15:58.541 --> 16:00.919
There.
A new face at the bank.

16:02.963 --> 16:05.924
- You like it?
- Oh, you...

16:07.592 --> 16:09.803
I guess that's a "yes,"
or is that the way you fight?

16:10.095 --> 16:12.597
No. I like it. I love it.

16:13.807 --> 16:16.142
I haven't seen this woman in years.

16:16.434 --> 16:20.271
Well, now you got her back.
Try not to lose her.

16:21.606 --> 16:24.442
All right, go get
that cutie bank manager now.

16:26.653 --> 16:27.696
Loan approved.

16:28.571 --> 16:29.614
What?

16:30.699 --> 16:31.992
You got your loan.

16:32.283 --> 16:34.786
I got it? Oh, yes!

16:35.078 --> 16:36.788
Go Gina,
it's your birthday

16:37.080 --> 16:39.332
I got a hundred-fifty thou',
a hundred-fifty thou'

16:39.624 --> 16:40.417
- No, Gina, no, no.
- A hundred-fifty--

16:40.709 --> 16:43.003
No, I...No,we...
Not quite that much.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.713
That's cool.

16:45.005 --> 16:46.089
I'll take a hundred thousand!

16:46.381 --> 16:50.051
- No, no, Gina.
- What? What? No?

16:50.343 --> 16:52.971
What? Like 95? 85?

16:53.263 --> 16:56.516
- I can work with sev... Lower than that?
- Thirty.

16:56.808 --> 17:00.979
Thirty thousand dollars?
What kind of shop can I buy with that?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.693
Lord Jesus, have mercy!

17:06.984 --> 17:10.030
Look like somebody swallowed
the '70s and threw it up in here.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.324
Now, Gina, I've been
in some messed up salons, but damn!

17:13.616 --> 17:16.618
Girl, this is just straight-up nasty!

17:17.829 --> 17:19.580
Thanks, Darnelle.
Tell me how you really feel.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.588
What's that supposed to be?

17:28.923 --> 17:31.885
Looks like some kind of skylight.

17:32.761 --> 17:35.346
Mama, that look like a big ol' hole
in the ceilin' to me.

17:35.638 --> 17:38.099
I got an electrician
coming to look at that tomorrow.

17:38.391 --> 17:42.729
Listen to that.
Whoever's up there can play.

17:43.021 --> 17:44.272
And they need to stop.

17:44.564 --> 17:47.984
The realtor told me I'd be inheriting
a few stylists, not a whole damn band.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.987
Well, Gina, let's just look
at the blessing in it.

17:51.279 --> 17:53.698
You've got your own beauty shop!

17:53.990 --> 17:56.493
Be happy. It's yours!

17:56.785 --> 17:58.536
Come on,
let's make this place sparkle!

17:58.828 --> 18:00.705
I'm ready!
Let's turn this into Gina's!

18:00.997 --> 18:02.499
Turn that music on!

19:03.476 --> 19:06.437
There we go...
Madam C.J.

19:10.733 --> 19:11.734
Hi, can I help you?

19:12.026 --> 19:15.113
Yes, ma'am.
I received a message yesterday.

19:15.405 --> 19:17.991
Joe's Electrical Repairs.
I'm Joe.

19:19.617 --> 19:21.870
I found your business card
on Miss Angeline's desk,

19:22.162 --> 19:23.955
and I was guessing
you had done some work here before?

19:24.247 --> 19:27.792
A little. Miss Angeline
wasn't exactly into repair and upkeep.

19:28.084 --> 19:30.920
- Who you telling?
- Well, it looks nice.

19:31.212 --> 19:32.505
- You've done a great job with it.
- Thank you.

19:32.797 --> 19:33.923
And you are?

19:34.215 --> 19:36.092
I'm Gina. Sorry.

19:36.384 --> 19:39.762
And this is my mother-in-law,
that's Paulette and her daughter Darnelle.

19:40.054 --> 19:42.891
- And that's my baby, Vanessa.
- Ladies.

19:45.935 --> 19:49.355
So, you're familiar with the place.
How bad is it?

19:50.732 --> 19:52.275
The place needs a lot of work.

19:52.567 --> 19:56.571
Rotting wires, outdated sockets...

19:58.907 --> 20:00.742
And the main breaker
keeps getting tripped.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.204
- Is that a problem?
- Not if you like standing in the dark.

20:05.121 --> 20:08.166
A lot just needs to be done.
A total upgrade.

20:08.458 --> 20:12.045
Well, right now, I just need you
to take care of this one thing for me.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.382
Now, you see
this big ol' hole in the ceilin'?

20:16.674 --> 20:17.592
That just ain't workin' for me.

20:17.884 --> 20:20.637
Neither's the piano playing coming
out of it, if you know what I'm saying,

20:20.929 --> 20:22.513
so I just need you to take those wires

20:22.805 --> 20:26.059
and sort of stuff 'em back up in there
so I can patch up the ceiling.

20:26.351 --> 20:26.935
Can you do that for me?

20:27.227 --> 20:27.560
Can you do that for me?

20:27.936 --> 20:31.189
I could, but that's not going
to solve your dilemma.

20:32.232 --> 20:34.484
So, let's say I do
the whole upgrade thingamajig.

20:34.776 --> 20:35.985
How much is that gonna cost me?

20:38.863 --> 20:40.365
I'd say between 4,000 to 6,000.

20:41.199 --> 20:43.868
Well, don't let the doorknob
hit you on the way out.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.164
Okay, then...Good luck.

20:49.958 --> 20:51.918
Wait, wait.
Come on, what about the ceilin'?

20:52.210 --> 20:53.169
Don't look at it.

20:54.170 --> 20:56.798
I guess I'm supposed to ignore
the piano playin' comin' through it?

20:57.090 --> 20:58.841
I'll try to play more quietly.

21:04.722 --> 21:06.099
I play piano, too.

21:06.391 --> 21:07.725
Is that right, mademoiselle?

21:08.017 --> 21:10.353
Yeah. Maybe I can come up
and play some time?

21:14.524 --> 21:16.526
Maybe. We'll see, little one.

21:18.987 --> 21:21.990
- Ladies, ciao.
- Bye.

21:28.830 --> 21:30.915
Mama, I like him.

21:32.709 --> 21:34.877
And I like you
with this broom in your hand.

21:36.796 --> 21:40.675
Gina, it's looking beautiful.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.594
You think the ladies will like it
when they come in tomorrow?

21:43.886 --> 21:45.930
Please, compared
to what they were workin' with

21:46.222 --> 21:48.516
before we got here,
they should love it.

21:49.225 --> 21:51.102
So, what don't you like
about the place?

21:51.811 --> 21:53.354
I ain't sayin' I don't like it.

21:53.646 --> 21:57.942
I just say, you know, I don't think
it's all 0' that. That's all.

21:58.234 --> 22:02.030
For real. It's gonna take more
than a new little paint job

22:02.322 --> 22:03.614
and some posters to impress me.

22:03.906 --> 22:06.534
This coming from a woman
who had Popeye's cater her wedding.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.578
Church's.
It was Church's, Josephine.

22:08.870 --> 22:11.247
- It was chicken.
- I ain't mad at you.

22:11.539 --> 22:13.708
I had Gladys Knight
Chicken and Waffles cater mine.

22:14.000 --> 22:15.293
I still got waffles in the freezer.

22:15.585 --> 22:17.170
Would y'all let the woman
who own the shop talk?

22:17.462 --> 22:18.421
Go on, Gina.

22:18.713 --> 22:19.505
Thank you, Miss Josephine.

22:19.797 --> 22:22.258
Say what you got to say.
It's your shop, sister.

22:22.550 --> 22:23.968
All right, now,
what I was trying to say wa...

22:24.260 --> 22:25.928
They ain't gonna listen, no way.

22:26.971 --> 22:28.473
Talk to us, go on.

22:29.223 --> 22:30.266
Go on.

22:33.603 --> 22:35.438
What I was tryin' to say was, no--

22:35.730 --> 22:36.647
What about the booth rent?

22:36.939 --> 22:38.691
I hope you don't plan on raisin' it.

22:38.983 --> 22:40.526
Can't be coming outta pocket, Gina.

22:40.818 --> 22:42.987
I can't come outta pocket.

22:43.279 --> 22:46.574
M.J. got basketball camp,
baby A-Rod need a new stroller,

22:46.866 --> 22:48.743
and little Shaq, he need braces.

22:49.577 --> 22:52.038
Dang, girl. You got you
a little Dream Team over there, huh?

22:52.330 --> 22:56.876
And look, Auntie Gina, this one here
is Venus Serena Marion Jones, Junior.

22:57.168 --> 23:00.129
Right, that's Auntie Gina's baby.

23:01.381 --> 23:05.426
So, look, as of right now,
no, I'm not gonna raise the booth rent,

23:05.718 --> 23:07.970
but I will be making
some changes around here.

23:08.262 --> 23:11.891
Look, I'm trying to create an environment
where you can come and relax.

23:12.183 --> 23:14.560
All right? We are professionals.
Professionals.

23:14.852 --> 23:17.146
And you never know, Oprah
might come strollin' up in here one day.

23:17.438 --> 23:21.359
Yeah, you know, if she mistook the place
for, what, a Krispy Kreme joint?

23:22.276 --> 23:25.071
You need to hush, little sister.
You ain't got a pot to piss in.

23:25.363 --> 23:27.448
Oprah pot platinum, baby.

23:27.740 --> 23:31.536
You know that poem Maya Angelou wrote?
"Phenomenal Woman"?

23:32.245 --> 23:35.915
"Pretty woman,
wonder where my secret lies?

23:36.207 --> 23:40.420
I ain't cute or built to fit
a fashion-model size."

23:40.711 --> 23:42.672
She's talking about Oprah, hon!

23:43.381 --> 23:47.593
Yes, she was! And just like Oprah,
I wanna be the best.

23:47.885 --> 23:50.930
And in order to be the best,
we got to change the game a little bit.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.724
Which brings me to this--
please, no more food on the counters.

23:54.016 --> 23:55.768
Let's try to keep it
as clean as we can.

23:56.060 --> 23:57.895
You know what?
I make you this promise.

23:58.187 --> 24:00.356
I ain't gonna get
no food on your stuff.

24:00.648 --> 24:01.774
Don't sit--

24:03.067 --> 24:05.236
That's a little syrup
spilled on the seat.

24:05.528 --> 24:06.320
That's a white couch.

24:06.612 --> 24:08.030
But it look like Louis Vuitton.

24:08.322 --> 24:09.991
They ain't gonna know.

24:10.283 --> 24:11.159
- High fashion.
- Turn it over.

24:11.451 --> 24:12.827
- You can Shout it out.
- Shout it out.

24:13.119 --> 24:14.871
- Pull it out and throw it in the dryer.
- What's up?

24:15.163 --> 24:16.998
Yo, look,
we gotta work as a team.

24:17.290 --> 24:21.085
In order to work as a team,
we have to look like a team.

24:21.377 --> 24:24.255
New smacks, one size fits all.
Porsche, Mercedes.

24:24.547 --> 24:26.090
- What?
- Okay?

24:26.382 --> 24:29.510
They ain't had none
of these with some Kente cloth

24:29.802 --> 24:33.556
or somethin' more with a little
Motherland flavor, a cheetah print?

24:33.848 --> 24:36.809
This ain't got no breast flap.
I mean, how am I supposed to--

24:37.101 --> 24:40.438
If I--Maybe right here.
Maybe it'll slip through the hole.

24:43.191 --> 24:44.066
Am I late?

24:44.358 --> 24:45.109
Hey! No, no, no.

24:45.401 --> 24:46.861
You right on time, girl.
Come on in.

24:47.153 --> 24:48.988
Everybody, this is Lynn.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.742
Lynn is one of the baddest hair stylists
to ever set foot out of Augusta--

24:53.034 --> 24:53.784
Blue Ridge.

24:54.076 --> 24:55.328
Blue Ridge, Georgia.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.830
She got mad skills.
The girl is talented.

24:58.122 --> 24:59.832
And she gonna be working
here in the shop with us.

25:00.124 --> 25:02.001
Working here. As what?

25:03.127 --> 25:04.629
As a stylist.

25:04.921 --> 25:06.297
Hell, no!

25:06.589 --> 25:08.174
Hell, no!

25:08.466 --> 25:11.260
Come on.
Okay, you know what?

25:11.552 --> 25:14.263
I'm sorry, but you doing
a little too much around here, okay?

25:14.555 --> 25:17.266
I mean, you ain't tryin'
to, what, brighten up the place.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.519
You's tryin' to whiten up the place.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.770
For real.

25:21.062 --> 25:23.064
So, here's what I'ma do, Gina.

25:23.356 --> 25:27.777
I'ma let you and little Miss Blue Ridge,
here, you know, have the shop.

25:28.069 --> 25:31.405
Do your thang.
Go on, girl! Do your thang.

25:31.697 --> 25:35.993
'Cause I can't be a part of this, okay?
Porsche, are you rollin'?

25:37.995 --> 25:40.206
Yeah. I ain't gonna be able
to do it, either.

25:40.498 --> 25:43.709
- I didn't mean to run 'em out.
- No, no, don't even worry about it.

25:44.001 --> 25:46.212
Better we get rid
of the bad apples now.

25:46.504 --> 25:48.297
Besides, them girls
got too much attitude.

25:48.589 --> 25:50.925
I 'bout to slap the shit
out of one 0' they asses.

25:51.884 --> 25:55.304
A'ight, anybody else leavin'?
'Cause this white bitch here is stayin'.

25:56.556 --> 25:57.557
Chanel.

25:57.848 --> 26:00.268
You know, no white girl
is gonna mess up me and my money.

26:00.560 --> 26:01.477
Y'all can go.

26:01.769 --> 26:05.064
- Whatever.
- A'ight...whatever.

26:05.356 --> 26:09.235
All right. Y'all, you wanna fly
outta here with them birds?

26:09.527 --> 26:12.363
'Cause I got a business to run.
I need to know something.

26:15.074 --> 26:17.994
That's what I'm talking about.
All right.

26:26.502 --> 26:28.004
Gina's Beauty Shop.

26:30.339 --> 26:33.092
No problem.
Thank you. Bye-bye.

26:34.635 --> 26:37.346
- Excuse me.
- May I offer you a cappuccino?

26:37.638 --> 26:40.057
I don't want
no damn cappa-whatever-it-is.

26:40.349 --> 26:41.934
Where's Angeline at?

26:42.768 --> 26:44.395
I'm sorry.
She's no longer here.

26:44.687 --> 26:48.608
- She die?
- No, no, no, she didn't die.

26:48.899 --> 26:50.401
Then where is she?
'Cause I got an appointment.

26:50.693 --> 26:53.487
Well, my name is Gina.
I bought the shop from Miss Angeline.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.365
I can have one of my other operators
assist you, if you like, Miss...

26:56.657 --> 26:58.242
Mrs. Towner.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.327
Mrs. Towner.

26:59.619 --> 27:02.330
"T" as in "Tom,"
"O" as in "Othavee,"

27:02.622 --> 27:06.292
"W" as in "Willacoochee, Georgia."

27:06.584 --> 27:08.252
- Willacoochee.
- And "ner" as in...

27:08.544 --> 27:10.379
"I don't live 'ner' here."

27:10.671 --> 27:12.965
Well, don't let me
keep you waiting any longer.

27:13.257 --> 27:16.260
Come on, now. Would you like
some water or something, Mrs. Towner?

27:16.552 --> 27:17.637
Yes, please. Thank you.

27:17.928 --> 27:20.681
Lynn, would you take care
of Mrs. Towner, please?

27:20.973 --> 27:24.018
Of course.
Hi, Mrs. Towner.

27:24.894 --> 27:27.563
When'd you all get to be
so integrated 'round here?

27:27.855 --> 27:31.108
This morning.
What can I do for you today?

27:31.400 --> 27:34.695
Don't give me no 'fro.
Just keep my curls neat and tight.

27:34.987 --> 27:36.822
And then maybe
you can pin it up for me.

27:37.114 --> 27:37.948
Not a problem.

27:38.240 --> 27:40.618
Girl, what you know
'bout doin' black folks' hair?

27:40.910 --> 27:42.995
I'm not gonna screw it up,
if that's what you mean.

27:43.287 --> 27:44.330
Good for you.

27:45.122 --> 27:47.458
Here's your water, Miss Towner--Mrs.

27:47.750 --> 27:48.709
Well, thank you, sweetie.

28:00.429 --> 28:03.516
...and I'm tellin' him to move back
just a little bit, you know what I mean?

28:03.808 --> 28:05.393
But he wouldn't even move back.

28:07.978 --> 28:10.731
Well, either I'm still buzzin'
from last night's party,

28:11.023 --> 28:12.066
or Miss Angeline done come up.

28:12.358 --> 28:15.361
For real, though, from backwood
to Hollywood. This is nice.

28:15.653 --> 28:17.947
Ladies, hi. I'm Gina.
I'm the new owner.

28:18.239 --> 28:19.407
Can I offer you some cappuccinos?

28:19.699 --> 28:21.242
- Or water? Some coffee?
- Don't mind if I do.

28:21.534 --> 28:24.203
- I like you already, Miss Gina.
- Me, too.

28:24.495 --> 28:28.332
Damn! Look at you
with that big ol' rock on your finger!

28:28.624 --> 28:30.251
You ought to be careful
rollin' with that.

28:30.543 --> 28:33.546
Just a little six-karat keepsake
my husband bought me.

28:33.838 --> 28:37.258
Christopher Clark...
power forward...Atlanta Hawks?

28:37.550 --> 28:39.927
"Three-point Chris"?
That's your husband?

28:40.219 --> 28:42.221
Oh, my God, girl, he got game.

28:42.513 --> 28:43.431
Yes, he does.

28:43.723 --> 28:45.850
Anyhoo, I have an appointment
with Mercedes today.

28:46.142 --> 28:46.642
Anyhoo, I have an appointment
with Mercedes today.

28:49.019 --> 28:50.771
She no longer works here.

28:51.063 --> 28:53.607
Well, we'll take Porsche today, then.

28:54.734 --> 28:56.110
She gone, too.

28:56.402 --> 28:58.738
Actually, we got rid
of all of our foreign cars.

28:59.989 --> 29:02.366
Well, damn!
I couldn't get a heads-up or something?

29:02.658 --> 29:04.660
You know, we should
just go on over to Aspire, girl,

29:04.952 --> 29:06.495
and get in where we fit in,
'cause obviously this--

29:06.787 --> 29:09.749
Well, you could do that or...
you could let me do your hair.

29:10.040 --> 29:13.461
I know how you like to roll.
You like to keep it tight. I can tell.

29:13.753 --> 29:15.087
You don't play about your look.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.674
And let me tell you somethin', I will have
you lookin' fly as a mug courtside.

29:18.966 --> 29:21.510
Did I tell you my name was Gina?
I don't play about my edges.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.179
I will lay that hair down.

29:23.471 --> 29:25.973
I'll have it shining
up on that big ol' Jumbotron,

29:26.265 --> 29:28.309
that big monitor TV
that be in the arena.

29:28.601 --> 29:29.560
Yeah, that's right.

29:29.852 --> 29:32.313
You gonna have to just stop
and take a look at yourself,

29:32.605 --> 29:34.356
because everybody else
gonna be looking at you.

29:36.275 --> 29:38.402
I'm so sorry,
but I don't really know you.

29:40.780 --> 29:41.989
I'll do it for free.

29:42.281 --> 29:43.824
So where should I sit?

29:44.116 --> 29:45.326
No, I can't do highlights.

29:45.618 --> 29:49.538
My client has an important game tonight,
and I'm trying to go with the P-I-M-P look.

29:49.830 --> 29:52.500
Well, perhaps Jorge
is not for you, then.

29:53.793 --> 29:58.088
No, you know...
Maybe Jorge is for me.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.508
- Let's do this.
- Great.

30:00.800 --> 30:02.593
Stacy, where is the shampooing girl,
what's her name?

30:02.885 --> 30:04.220
We need to get Corky washed.

30:04.512 --> 30:06.055
You mean Lynn? She quit.

30:06.347 --> 30:07.723
Come again?

30:08.015 --> 30:08.808
She quit.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.101
She called this morning.
I left a message on your desk.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.772
She said that if anyone asks,
that she was working down at Gina's.

30:15.773 --> 30:16.899
Working at Gina's what?

30:17.191 --> 30:18.234
Gina's salon.

30:21.362 --> 30:23.113
Okay, well...

30:23.405 --> 30:26.700
Today is your lucky day.
I'll wash you myself. Come with me.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.621
Have a seat.

30:30.913 --> 30:31.747
Don't forget to use a cape.

30:32.957 --> 30:37.086
It's not my first day at the picnic, Stacy.
I know all about the cape, ja?

30:39.505 --> 30:41.173
Shouldn't I be taking my jacket off?

30:41.465 --> 30:43.384
Leave the jacket,
take off your pants. I'm kidding.

30:46.804 --> 30:48.514
Stacy! Stacy!

30:52.893 --> 30:54.478
I'm sorry, I just need a moment.

30:59.567 --> 31:01.026
Looks good, don't it?

31:01.318 --> 31:03.654
Girl, it looks good.
That's all you?

31:03.946 --> 31:06.407
This is my hair. Blown out.

31:06.699 --> 31:09.535
Yup, girl, it's nice!

31:14.206 --> 31:16.625
Well, Gina, I'm booking you, girl.
When can you get me in?

31:17.334 --> 31:21.422
- I can take you tomorrow at 10:00.
- I'll be here at 8:45.

31:28.971 --> 31:31.015
Say, now, mama,
how you doing?

31:32.266 --> 31:35.853
Damn!
You a nice little pound cake.

31:38.772 --> 31:39.982
How y'all doin'?

31:40.274 --> 31:42.651
Y'all want a little chocolate?
Y'all don't want nothin'?

31:42.943 --> 31:45.195
Y'all looking, sittin' over here,
lookin' all done up and thang.

31:45.487 --> 31:47.072
So, I figured y'all want somethin'.

31:47.990 --> 31:51.035
So y'all just gonna float on
past a brother.

31:51.327 --> 31:53.829
Brother can't get no communicate?
A'ight, then.

31:57.499 --> 31:58.792
How you doin'?

31:59.084 --> 32:02.755
Damn, you a thick one!
You got top and bottom.

32:03.589 --> 32:06.884
Gimme a quarter. I promised my mama
I'd call her as soon as I fell in love.

32:08.510 --> 32:09.762
Whassup, little man?
What you sellin'?

32:10.054 --> 32:11.221
Candy bars.

32:11.513 --> 32:13.140
See, I'm raisin' money
so I can shoot my music video.

32:13.432 --> 32:15.392
If you want, you could be in it.

32:15.684 --> 32:17.102
Come and get low wit' it.
Shake it like a salt shaker.

32:17.394 --> 32:18.729
Shake it like a salt shaker!

32:19.563 --> 32:20.564
What is your name?

32:20.856 --> 32:24.068
I'm Willie, a.k.a. Will-Boogie,
from Decatur, Georgia.

32:24.360 --> 32:25.778
That my daddy pawn shop next door.

32:26.070 --> 32:27.321
What yo' name, meal?

32:27.613 --> 32:29.573
My name is Gina. I own the shop.

32:29.865 --> 32:31.992
And if you want to sell
your candy in here,

32:32.284 --> 32:35.079
you gonna have to learn how to be
a little more courteous to the ladies.

32:35.371 --> 32:37.539
- I got that, no doubt. My bad, Gina.
- All right. Okay.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.084
So, Miss Gina, you gonna buy
some five-dollar chocolate

32:40.376 --> 32:42.544
to go with those healthy
milk-sacks you got?

32:51.845 --> 32:55.015
Don't bring your little behind back here
till you learn how to speak to a lady!

32:58.394 --> 32:59.770
That's what you get!

33:03.899 --> 33:05.818
She loves me.

33:21.500 --> 33:24.586
Don't you even try, girl.
I don't know whose bike this is.

33:24.878 --> 33:26.422
- Can I have one?
- Can you have one?

33:26.714 --> 33:27.506
Can I have one?

33:29.008 --> 33:30.467
Hey, Nana.

33:30.759 --> 33:32.177
- How's my girls?
- Good.

33:32.469 --> 33:33.554
- Hey, Paulette.
- All right?

33:33.846 --> 33:35.097
Go and get cleaned up, baby.

33:39.476 --> 33:40.978
It feels good to be home.

33:41.270 --> 33:43.564
So, Gina, how was it?

33:43.856 --> 33:45.399
Well, it was...

33:49.069 --> 33:50.779
I know that bike out there ain't yours.

33:51.071 --> 33:52.823
No, girl. That's P.J.'s bike.

33:53.532 --> 33:55.909
- I ain't even gonna ask.
- A'ight, Mama.

33:56.201 --> 33:57.494
I'm gone.

33:57.786 --> 33:59.580
- Bye.
- Bye, Darnelle.

33:59.872 --> 34:03.834
- You be careful on that bike, hear?
- Mama, I will.

34:05.377 --> 34:10.090
Gina, I swear, it's more trouble
havin' that girl than it was makin' her.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.509
See, your father-in-law
had a crooked one.

34:12.801 --> 34:15.971
I had to walk around the corner
just to get on it.

34:16.263 --> 34:17.347
So, what were you...

34:23.896 --> 34:27.440
So, I must've put it on the brother,
'cause the fool wouldn't leave me alone.

34:27.733 --> 34:30.819
I mean, he was blowin' up my phone,
my girlfriend's phone,

34:31.110 --> 34:32.821
drivin' by my house,
my mama's house.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.782
This dude was straight trippin'.

34:35.074 --> 34:38.202
So I did what any other normal
black woman would do.

34:38.494 --> 34:39.828
'Cause a white girl wouldn't do this.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.996
- They go down to the police station...
- Come on.

34:42.289 --> 34:45.208
Get a restrainin' order,
piss the man off and have him waitin'

34:45.501 --> 34:48.087
in the damn bushes
with a butcher knife ready to kill a bitch.

34:49.963 --> 34:51.632
- I had to get creative.
- That's great.

34:51.924 --> 34:53.884
Go ghetto on a black man.

34:54.176 --> 34:56.762
- Y'all say "ghetto."
- Ghetto!

34:57.054 --> 35:01.016
- Ghetto!
- A sistah had to get sinister on a Negro.

35:01.308 --> 35:04.394
Basically, a woman
had to do what she had to do.

35:04.686 --> 35:07.064
- What'd you do?
- I lied and told him I was pregnant.

35:07.356 --> 35:12.111
I ain't seen that fool in ten years.
I ain't lyin', ladies. Wrong or right?

35:12.402 --> 35:13.737
I wanna hear from ya, Hotlanta.

35:14.029 --> 35:16.073
Holler at Helen
or hit me on my website

35:16.365 --> 35:19.952
at www.how-to-shake-a-nigga.com.

35:20.244 --> 35:22.162
No, she didn't.

35:22.454 --> 35:24.915
I didn't know you could say
the "N" word on the radio.

35:25.207 --> 35:30.003
No, no, sweetie.
She can say it, you just can't.

35:31.296 --> 35:32.172
You know what?

35:32.464 --> 35:36.135
Now, you could be black, white,
ghetto past, no ghetto past,

35:36.426 --> 35:38.470
ain't nobody sayin'
the "N" word up in this shop.

35:39.429 --> 35:43.350
And no "bitches" and "hos," either.
'Cept for the ones who don't leave a tip.

35:43.642 --> 35:45.853
That's for real, that's for real.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.480
But we will be wearin' our smocks
unless your name is Gina.

35:48.772 --> 35:50.399
I forgot.

35:55.904 --> 36:00.117
Look good, don't it?
I had to put a little Motherland flavor on it.

36:00.409 --> 36:01.869
Some sexiness.

36:04.454 --> 36:06.123
It's a little too sexy.

36:06.415 --> 36:07.791
You might wanna use
some of that mud cloth

36:08.083 --> 36:09.710
and like, kinda, you know,
cover up the girls.

36:10.002 --> 36:12.379
"Does my sexiness offend you?"

36:13.130 --> 36:14.047
No. I'm just sayin'--

36:14.339 --> 36:16.633
"Does it come as a surprise?"

36:16.925 --> 36:17.676
Ah, Lord!

36:17.968 --> 36:22.389
"That I dance like I got diamonds
at the meetin' of my thighs?"

36:22.681 --> 36:25.142
Lord, here we go.
Her and her Miss Angeloo.

36:25.434 --> 36:29.438
Angelou.
"Does my haughtiness offend you?

36:29.730 --> 36:32.357
"Don't you take it awful hard

36:32.649 --> 36:36.904
"'cause I laugh
like I got gold mines

36:37.196 --> 36:39.531
diggin' in my own backyard."

36:40.908 --> 36:42.910
Don't dig too deep,
Miss Josephine.

36:44.077 --> 36:48.248
"Leavin' behind nights
of terror and fear

36:48.540 --> 36:54.046
"I rise into a daybreak
that is wondrously clear.

36:54.338 --> 36:58.759
"I rise bringin' the gifts
that the ancestors gave.

36:59.051 --> 37:02.721
"I am the dream
and the hope of the slave.

37:03.013 --> 37:04.640
I rise!

37:04.932 --> 37:05.974
I rise!

37:06.266 --> 37:07.768
I rise!

37:08.060 --> 37:08.936
Yeah, I rise!

37:15.609 --> 37:18.487
All right, let's rise our asses
back to work. Come on, now.

38:10.080 --> 38:12.791
Hotlanta, Helen be talkin'
to ya standin' up,

38:13.083 --> 38:15.794
'cause I just went
and got me a bikini wax.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.797
Damn! That ain't natural,
doin' that torture to yourself!

38:19.089 --> 38:20.882
I/I/hat's the big deal
'bout some stray hair?

38:21.174 --> 38:23.343
You be doin' it to look
all clean for your man,

38:23.635 --> 38:26.179
but it hurts so damn much, you don't
want him comin' nowhere near it!

38:26.471 --> 38:28.557
Man, Gina, you can make
some serious bling,

38:28.849 --> 38:30.851
you start doin' some waxes
up in here, girl.

38:31.143 --> 38:33.395
You like landscapin',
why don't you plant yourself a garden?

38:33.687 --> 38:36.106
Please, honey. My man loves it.

38:36.398 --> 38:37.399
I know that's right.

38:37.691 --> 38:39.234
And it helps 'em
know where they goin'.

38:39.526 --> 38:41.903
Girl, ain't nobody gonna come
over to your house if they can't find it.

38:42.195 --> 38:45.240
Well, my man
found my door just fine.

38:45.532 --> 38:46.658
That's a revolvin' door.

38:46.950 --> 38:48.493
Okay, nasty heifers.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.913
You know, real men
like a woman natural and wild!

38:52.205 --> 38:55.208
Girl, please, you are preaching
to your damn self, honey.

38:55.500 --> 38:59.421
My man likes it trimmed and perfect.
He even waxes his own brows.

38:59.713 --> 39:02.174
Oh, girl, you got one
0' them cryin' men, don't you?

39:02.466 --> 39:04.259
No. No, I don't.

39:04.551 --> 39:05.802
You show me a man can't cry,

39:06.094 --> 39:08.055
and I'll show you one
that's hittin' somebody.

39:08.347 --> 39:09.765
I'm gonna let him cry.

39:10.057 --> 39:11.975
I only got time for one cryin' man.

39:12.267 --> 39:14.644
And in my house,
it better be the one wearin' the diapers.

39:15.479 --> 39:20.025
Well, how about when you're
makin' mad, passionate love...

39:21.026 --> 39:23.445
...and he reaches his climax,

39:23.737 --> 39:26.114
and that one little tear
starts rollin' down his face

39:26.406 --> 39:29.534
like Denzel Washington in Glory?

39:32.788 --> 39:34.581
Then you got him whipped!

39:36.625 --> 39:39.002
She had to say Denzel.
She couldn't have said Brad Pitt.

39:39.294 --> 39:40.754
Hell, she coulda said Bozo the Clown.

39:41.046 --> 39:42.506
Hey, darlin'!

39:42.798 --> 39:45.592
How you doin'?
Bet you no good, darlin'.

39:47.010 --> 39:49.554
Look at this!
Is that Italian marble?

39:49.846 --> 39:52.891
Girl, who y'all got invested
up in here, Ted Turner?

39:53.183 --> 39:55.185
Lord, Miss Rita got catfish dinner,

39:55.477 --> 39:57.479
sock-it-to-me cake
and blueberry bean pie.

39:57.771 --> 40:00.440
- What y'all want, darlings?
- Excuse me. Excuse me, Rita?

40:00.732 --> 40:02.067
How you doin', darlin'?
Get in line, sweetheart.

40:02.359 --> 40:03.652
Get in line?
I don't think you understand.

40:03.944 --> 40:05.237
I'm Gina.
I'm the new owner of this place.

40:05.529 --> 40:07.155
- And I'd appreciate--
- You the new owner?

40:07.447 --> 40:08.990
I'm so glad
you the new owner, baby,

40:09.282 --> 40:12.494
'cause, you know, Miss Angeline,
well, she used to skim off my fish dinners.

40:12.786 --> 40:14.413
You know, she's a Christian,
but I think she La Cosa Nostra.

40:14.704 --> 40:15.497
Hold this for me.

40:15.789 --> 40:19.793
Here, darlin', I'll always have
a plate of food for you, Gina.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.337
That's free food.
You need a extra piece of monkey bread?

40:22.629 --> 40:24.881
The monkey just jump right outta me.
I don't know what happens to her.

40:25.173 --> 40:26.258
- And then lookit, we got the greens...
- Oh, you!

40:26.550 --> 40:28.343
Yeah, you, there. Hey.

40:28.635 --> 40:32.764
Could you go ahead and park my car,
and just let me tip you later, because...

40:33.056 --> 40:34.391
Shit. Hold this for me.

40:36.309 --> 40:38.145
Terri, how you doin'?
One second.

40:38.437 --> 40:42.774
'Scuse me? Gimme them damn keys!
What's wrong with you?

40:46.611 --> 40:47.654
Where'd the valet go?

40:47.946 --> 40:50.115
He's...goin' to take a coffee break.

40:50.407 --> 40:54.786
- What are you doin' around here?
- Look what Mindy at Jorge's did to me!

40:55.579 --> 40:57.247
I look like a scarecrow!

40:59.958 --> 41:01.626
You saved my hair, Gina.

41:01.918 --> 41:04.004
Well, don't make me
have to save it again, girl.

41:04.296 --> 41:05.255
I'm coming here.

41:06.256 --> 41:08.550
Monkey bread?
It just come out of me like that.

41:08.842 --> 41:10.760
- No, no, thank you.
- For sure?

41:11.052 --> 41:12.679
I made it fresh this mornin'!
You gonna love it.

41:12.971 --> 41:14.764
- I got some greens, some okra, knuckles.
- Rita, Rita.

41:15.056 --> 41:16.016
You gonna love it.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.476
She says she don't want none.

41:17.767 --> 41:20.854
Okay, my bad. I'm just tryin'
to put a little fat on her.

41:21.146 --> 41:22.731
- Take that with you, darlin'.
- No, I really shouldn't.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.150
You see, Steven wants me
to lose a few pounds.

41:25.442 --> 41:27.569
- Who is Steven?
- Her husband.

41:27.861 --> 41:28.862
He wouldn't be singin' that song

41:29.154 --> 41:31.198
if you had one of them
J. Lo/BeyoncÃ© booties.

41:33.116 --> 41:34.826
Or if he had one 0' those.

41:35.660 --> 41:36.870
This is the picture
I was talkin' about...

41:37.162 --> 41:40.540
Damn! Now, see,
that's just too much ass.

41:40.832 --> 41:43.960
See, now, if a plane crash,
we could eat for days.

41:44.711 --> 41:47.255
- That's all burger, right there.
- Enjoy the view'?

41:47.547 --> 41:49.466
- Take a picture.
- All right.

41:50.091 --> 41:53.011
Look at these--Get yo' ass
out of my window 'fore I call the police!

41:53.303 --> 41:56.640
This ain't Magic City!
Broke-asses!

41:57.474 --> 41:59.809
- You see them pervs over there?
- You know, I really do miss Steven.

42:00.101 --> 42:02.729
- Seems like he's been gone forever.
- He gone again?

42:03.021 --> 42:05.440
Well, where's he off to this time,
Mr. Big-Time Sports Attorney?

42:05.732 --> 42:10.028
Hawaii, three weeks.
He's closin' some big deal or somethin'.

42:10.320 --> 42:13.406
He's tryin' to close a deal
on smackin' some Hawaiian ass.

42:13.698 --> 42:16.785
Girl, he's down there
bein' a Don Ho.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.829
- He tappin' on somethin'.
- Tappin'? What's tappin?

42:21.122 --> 42:24.209
- Tappin', tappin', tappin'.
- No, Steven's not like that.

42:24.501 --> 42:28.004
He, you know, he loves me.
He just works really hard.

42:28.296 --> 42:29.422
I bet he do.

42:30.507 --> 42:33.343
- I do want to look pretty for him, though.
- And you will.

42:33.635 --> 42:35.762
I cannot believe that Jorge
passed me off on Mindy.

42:36.054 --> 42:38.014
I mean, that shop is completely
out of control since you left.

42:38.306 --> 42:40.267
- Well, good. That's what he gets.
- Sorry.

42:42.143 --> 42:43.395
Speak 0' the devil!

42:45.981 --> 42:48.400
My angel, sweetness,
my God, I'm so sorry.

42:48.692 --> 42:50.235
I heard about the mishap
with your hair,

42:50.527 --> 42:53.363
and I want you to know
that Mindy has been released.

42:53.655 --> 42:57.909
Sweetheart, don't worry about that.
Gina's taking care of me.

42:58.201 --> 42:58.994
Gina who?

42:59.286 --> 43:00.620
You know, Gina Gina.

43:00.912 --> 43:02.914
- Say "hello," Gina.
- It's Gina, bitch.

43:03.873 --> 43:05.041
Bye, Jorge.

43:06.126 --> 43:08.086
- That felt good!
- Yes, it did!

43:12.132 --> 43:13.300
Can you get her
a free cappuccino, please?

43:13.592 --> 43:16.052
- The devil is everywhere. It don't mean--
- Be nice!

43:16.344 --> 43:17.596
I ain't talking to that woman.

43:17.887 --> 43:20.557
So what you girls think
about that Janice Jackson?

43:21.474 --> 43:22.892
Janet. Janet, baby.

43:23.184 --> 43:24.644
Janet...Jackson.

43:25.854 --> 43:27.314
She's crazy, huh?

43:27.606 --> 43:31.026
- Why she gotta be crazy?
- Well, you know, with the titty and all that.

43:31.318 --> 43:33.278
- What's wrong with the titty?
- No, I like--

43:33.570 --> 43:34.362
You like titties?

43:34.654 --> 43:35.739
No, I mean...

43:38.408 --> 43:40.619
I don't know if I'm fittin' in here.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.829
- Well, you just got here.
- Yeah, I know.

43:43.121 --> 43:48.126
I know I just got here,
but I feel really, really...

43:49.085 --> 43:49.919
white.

43:50.211 --> 43:53.465
You feel really white
as opposed to what other color?

43:53.757 --> 43:56.843
You know what I mean.
I'm not as hip as you guys are.

43:57.135 --> 44:00.221
Don't get me wrong, I can handle
the girls, as lame as I think they are.

44:00.513 --> 44:02.265
I can roll with the punches.

44:02.557 --> 44:05.852
But the fact is, I've only
had one client since I got here,

44:06.144 --> 44:07.228
and you gave her to me.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.564
So...maybe I should just go.

44:10.649 --> 44:12.901
Who should go
is that crazy-ass lady out there

44:13.193 --> 44:15.111
hustlin' them bean pies
and monkey bread.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.822
- Like she got Tourette's or somethin'.
- I don't know.

44:18.114 --> 44:19.366
I ain't never seen
nobody do nothin' like that.

44:19.658 --> 44:23.036
Got a twitch or somethin'.
No, Lynn, you fine.

44:23.328 --> 44:24.871
You know,
like when I was at Jorge's.

44:25.163 --> 44:30.043
Shoot. You think it wasn't hard
bein' the only "moniker" up in the shop?

44:30.752 --> 44:33.630
But I stuck it out,
and people warmed up...

44:33.922 --> 44:38.134
And eventually, it was like, blam!
I was doin' the damn thing.

44:40.095 --> 44:41.471
And so will you.

44:43.890 --> 44:46.226
Besides, you can't leave me
with these crazy people.

44:46.810 --> 44:49.396
Girl, I knew you liked them greens!

44:50.063 --> 44:53.858
You keep eatin' like that,
you gonna grow a big ol' Petey Pablo,

44:54.150 --> 44:57.112
Lil Jon and the EastSide Boyz,
Ying Yang Twin booty!

44:58.113 --> 45:01.324
Big booty just like Ida got.
You know, turnips did all 0' that.

45:01.866 --> 45:02.742
Girl, I knew you liked 'em.

45:03.034 --> 45:04.994
- Thank you, Gina.
- No problem, girl.

45:05.286 --> 45:07.247
- I got your back.
- Me, too.

45:07.539 --> 45:08.498
All right.

45:09.332 --> 45:11.960
- What?!
- I got hungry.

45:12.252 --> 45:14.129
- They're good.
- I see.

45:16.047 --> 45:17.298
The oppressor.

45:17.590 --> 45:19.926
- Who?
- State Board.

45:26.391 --> 45:27.684
I'm Gina. I'm the new owner.

45:27.976 --> 45:29.769
Well, guess what, Gina-new-owner?

45:30.061 --> 45:33.398
You have some major problems.
Inspector Crawford, State Board.

45:34.607 --> 45:36.192
I have to cite you
for the discarded equipment

45:36.484 --> 45:37.652
you have stacked up
out in the alley.

45:38.987 --> 45:41.322
Big Mike's Moving & Hauling
is picking that up today.

45:42.532 --> 45:45.326
- They always are.
- No. They real--

45:51.124 --> 45:54.169
This is for $500.
Come on, man, I just bought this place.

45:54.461 --> 45:56.421
I can't afford to be gettin' hit
with tickets like this.

45:56.713 --> 45:59.048
You sure can't.
Next one will be 1,000.

45:59.340 --> 46:01.050
One more after that
and I shut you down.

46:01.342 --> 46:02.677
Have a nice day.

46:02.969 --> 46:04.512
"Have a nice claw.

46:09.642 --> 46:10.894
Now y'all comin'.

46:16.608 --> 46:19.444
Well, your timin' is perfect.
Y'all slow.

46:19.736 --> 46:21.321
My bad. I been
runnin' solo for a month,

46:21.613 --> 46:23.907
and my boss, he think
I'm some kind of slave.

46:24.199 --> 46:25.325
Sign here.

46:26.409 --> 46:27.535
How long was you down for?

46:29.120 --> 46:31.289
Four months. Paroled out early.

46:31.581 --> 46:34.542
- Possession?
- Now, why you gotta assume a brother--

46:35.460 --> 46:37.962
Illegal sale of a restricted narcotic.

46:39.714 --> 46:41.591
So, where's the countertops and stuff?

46:42.509 --> 46:45.637
- Everything is back there in the alley.
- A'ight.

46:45.929 --> 46:49.432
By the way, who does your hair?
Your braids is tight.

46:50.099 --> 46:51.643
Thanks. I do it myself.

46:51.935 --> 46:53.102
Come on.

46:53.394 --> 46:55.730
For real. I used to braid
in the shop around the way.

46:56.022 --> 46:57.649
Then I caught this little case,
you know.

46:57.941 --> 47:00.235
But even in the pen, I did braid
all the homies' hair on the block.

47:03.863 --> 47:04.906
You like drivin' that truck?

47:05.198 --> 47:07.534
Ain't nothin' really else out there.

47:09.869 --> 47:11.329
Well...we may take--

47:12.539 --> 47:15.458
Dawg, how long it gon' take?

47:22.590 --> 47:24.884
Our boy is fine.

47:25.176 --> 47:26.636
Damn fine.

47:27.345 --> 47:29.848
I'd do him in a heartbeat
if I wasn't so damn fertile.

47:31.307 --> 47:34.435
- And didn't have a husband.
- He is cute.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.522
Thanks.

47:39.232 --> 47:40.275
Thanks.

47:41.609 --> 47:43.278
You got me next, right?

47:44.320 --> 47:45.905
I think I was here before you.

47:46.197 --> 47:48.283
What the hell is you talkin' about?
You ain't got no hair.

47:48.575 --> 47:51.035
- What?
- What's he gon' do, braid your scalp?

47:51.327 --> 47:52.328
- You watch your--
- Ladies, listen.

47:52.620 --> 47:54.414
I promise I'll take care of both 0' y'all.

47:54.706 --> 47:56.457
- I think she was here first.
- But she--

47:56.749 --> 47:59.544
Let me just take care 0' her
and then I'll definitely gon' get back to you,

47:59.836 --> 48:02.922
'cause in my mind, I'm still tryin'
to figure out how I'm gonna...

48:08.011 --> 48:11.306
But I'm telling you,
somethin' just ain't right.

48:14.684 --> 48:16.394
It's like he's too good-looking.

48:16.686 --> 48:18.897
You can't tell by looking
at the brother if he's gender-specific.

48:19.188 --> 48:22.609
Josephine, come on!
Look at the muscles on that boy.

48:22.901 --> 48:24.569
Fifty percent pumpin' iron,

48:24.861 --> 48:28.531
and the rest from fightin'
the brothers off that booty.

48:28.823 --> 48:30.533
He got a little swish down river.

48:32.827 --> 48:34.704
He is beautiful, ain't he?

48:36.539 --> 48:38.666
- Straight diamond in the rough.
- All shiny.

48:38.958 --> 48:40.376
'Scuse me. Let me see
if he wants some cappuccino.

48:40.668 --> 48:41.920
No, sh--

48:42.211 --> 48:44.005
- Dang.
- I don't know.

48:44.297 --> 48:46.132
I think he's straight.

48:47.926 --> 48:49.052
You are so new.

48:49.344 --> 48:50.345
James, you want a cappuccino?

48:50.637 --> 48:51.846
- Yeah, please.
- Here you go.

48:52.597 --> 48:54.390
- You want one?
- No. I'm okay, thanks.

48:54.682 --> 48:55.725
Cappuccino?

49:00.939 --> 49:01.898
Swish-swish.

49:02.190 --> 49:03.816
You better work

49:04.108 --> 49:05.026
Work it, girl

49:05.318 --> 49:06.486
- Cover girl.
- Do your thing!

49:06.778 --> 49:08.821
- Shante, shante.
- On the runway!

49:09.113 --> 49:10.490
- Work, cover gir--
- Get that phone.

49:13.743 --> 49:15.995
It's a great day
for a press and curl here at Gin--

49:19.624 --> 49:20.833
Hold on.

49:22.043 --> 49:23.628
It's a Darnelle.

49:24.712 --> 49:25.713
What up, D?

49:27.006 --> 49:28.091
You where?

49:43.731 --> 49:46.943
How does a grown-ass woman
get herself into this kind of trouble?

49:47.235 --> 49:49.737
How was I supposed to know
the bike was stolen?

49:50.029 --> 49:51.114
It don't matter.

49:51.406 --> 49:54.242
You gonna have to start makin'
some better choices with these men.

49:54.534 --> 49:56.577
This is the last time
I'm bailin' you out.

49:56.869 --> 49:58.913
Next time, I'ma let
your little butt sit there

49:59.205 --> 50:02.834
and let the chicks from "C" Block
pass you around for a carton 0' cigarettes.

50:03.126 --> 50:04.919
They'll love a little freak like you.

50:05.211 --> 50:08.715
- You gonna tell my mom about this?
- No, I ain't gonna tell your mama.

50:09.007 --> 50:10.633
I should.

50:10.925 --> 50:12.802
- Look...
- Why raise her blood pressure?

50:13.094 --> 50:16.472
Thank you, okay? Thank you.
Look, I'm sorry and I'll pay you back.

50:16.764 --> 50:21.019
- With what, D? You ain't even workin'.
- I know that.

50:21.310 --> 50:24.439
But, look, I'll find a way.
I promise.

50:24.731 --> 50:27.483
That's for sure. Ain't no secret
I'm gettin' my money back.

50:28.526 --> 50:31.446
I'ma get my money
one way or another.

50:47.336 --> 50:48.546
Cappuccino?

50:53.426 --> 50:55.678
Cappuccino? Water?

50:56.846 --> 50:59.390
There you go.
Say it like you mean it.

50:59.682 --> 51:01.934
No, scratch that.
Like you love it.

51:05.438 --> 51:08.024
- You want a cappuccino?
- No, baby.

51:08.316 --> 51:10.526
I don't eat or drink
nothing I can't spell.

51:16.407 --> 51:18.701
You must be
like the spellin' bee champ.

51:18.993 --> 51:21.370
Don't look like your mouth
is shy to a fork at all.

51:25.625 --> 51:28.294
Y'all hold it down.
I'm goin' to make a bank run.

51:41.140 --> 51:42.517
Say now, lover.

51:43.476 --> 51:46.896
Lookin' like a piece 0' red velvet cake,
so nice and sweet.

51:47.188 --> 51:50.066
Is your body named Visa?
'Cause it's everywhere I wanna be.

51:51.651 --> 51:52.985
Why don't you get some business?

51:53.277 --> 51:55.738
I got some business.
I'm shootin' footage for my music video.

51:56.030 --> 51:58.324
If you want, you can come be in it.
Come shake a little somethin'.

51:58.616 --> 52:00.910
Let me guess, you probably
want me to wear a bathing suit

52:01.202 --> 52:03.788
or some tight booty shorts
with a fishnet halter top, right?

52:04.080 --> 52:06.999
You ain't gotta wear no fishnet.
You could just wear a T-shirt.

52:08.084 --> 52:10.086
Just as long as you
don't mind gettin' it wet.

52:11.671 --> 52:14.173
- What's that you're listenin' to?
- Bach.

52:14.465 --> 52:16.467
Are you listenin' to Pac, too?
That's what I listen to.

52:16.759 --> 52:20.972
Bach...as in Johann Sebastian.
Classical composer.

52:22.390 --> 52:25.226
He the one look like the old dude
on the oatmeal box, right?

52:25.518 --> 52:26.978
Yeah. That's the one.

52:27.270 --> 52:28.646
Why you listen to that boring stuff?

52:28.938 --> 52:30.857
It's not boring. It's art.

52:32.567 --> 52:36.362
Dang.
Well, you got yo' art...

52:37.905 --> 52:39.240
...and I got mine.

52:39.532 --> 52:41.367
Now that's a money shot right there.

52:42.535 --> 52:43.995
Let's hat up, ya'll.

52:44.287 --> 52:46.372
Cracker Barrel "bring-a-friend"
gon' be over!

52:46.664 --> 52:49.083
I'm drivin'.
Y'all gon' be too full to walk back.

52:54.589 --> 52:55.464
Is that a purse?

52:55.756 --> 52:57.758
Nah. It's a man bag.

52:58.050 --> 52:58.926
A man bag?

52:59.218 --> 53:00.178
Yeah, a man bag.

53:00.469 --> 53:02.471
It's like the hottest new accessory
in men's fashion.

53:02.763 --> 53:05.183
You got some man lipstick
in that bag, James?

53:07.435 --> 53:10.188
They done took metrosexual too far.

53:10.479 --> 53:14.150
- Darnelle, you wanna come?
- I gotta stay and watch Vanessa.

53:16.611 --> 53:17.445
Lynn, you comin'?

53:17.737 --> 53:20.239
No, I'ma hang out. I'll be fine.

53:20.531 --> 53:22.200
A'ight. I'ma bring you
back somethin' anyway.

53:34.754 --> 53:36.589
Them girls don't like me
so much, do they?

53:36.881 --> 53:38.382
They don't even know you.

53:38.674 --> 53:42.011
How do you get to know someone
without trying to get to know someone?

53:42.303 --> 53:43.596
Like askin' 'em to lunch?

53:43.888 --> 53:45.806
I mean, well, some folks
just feel comfortable

53:46.098 --> 53:48.017
kickin' it with people they
have somethin' in common with.

53:48.309 --> 53:50.978
That's just racial profilin'.
That's all that is.

53:51.270 --> 53:53.022
When I worked
in my mama's shop in Blue Ridge,

53:53.314 --> 53:55.316
I did black, white, polka-dotted hair.

53:55.608 --> 53:56.359
It don't matter.

53:56.651 --> 53:58.986
Well, this ain't your mama's shop
in Blue Ridge.

53:59.278 --> 54:01.197
This is the SWATS, the ghetto.

54:01.489 --> 54:03.616
And you need to show people
that you tryin' to fit in, girl.

54:03.908 --> 54:04.867
I mean, look the part.

54:05.159 --> 54:06.744
I'm not followin'.

54:07.036 --> 54:09.956
Okay, Lynn, look,
it is all about the visual, okay?

54:10.248 --> 54:12.083
You could be
the best hair stylist up in here,

54:12.375 --> 54:13.960
but can't nobody tell by lookin' at you!

54:14.252 --> 54:18.005
Girl, presentation...is the key.

54:18.297 --> 54:21.384
Presentation?
What do you suggest?

54:21.676 --> 54:23.094
Just wait and see.

54:25.304 --> 54:26.514
Just trust me.

54:26.806 --> 54:28.140
Miss Gina! I've been seein'

54:28.432 --> 54:30.726
everything you have been doin'
around here with the beauty shop,

54:31.018 --> 54:32.728
and the shop is fabulous, honey!

54:33.020 --> 54:35.147
- Thank you, hon.
- But if you wanna let these divas have it,

54:35.439 --> 54:36.941
you need one of my handbags
for the runway,

54:37.233 --> 54:39.777
because it's spring,
and you don't want to be caught in suede.

54:40.069 --> 54:41.654
- That is cute.
- Yes, Miss Thing, honey.

54:41.946 --> 54:42.989
And the pink,
you gotta have your pink.

54:43.281 --> 54:46.742
It's spring, girl.
Push, push, fierce! It's fierce!

54:47.034 --> 54:48.452
You always gettin' me started out here.

54:48.744 --> 54:51.080
- Come on, now, Chris.
- Girl, honey.

54:51.372 --> 54:53.541
- Better work it.
- I'm gonna work it, girl.

54:53.833 --> 54:55.793
- I'll catch you.
- I'll catch you.

54:56.085 --> 54:58.546
- Now, push, baby.
- Push, diva, and catch it, honey.

54:58.838 --> 55:02.091
I know that's right! I done talked to you
about slammin' in front of my shop!

55:02.383 --> 55:03.968
...if you're gonna let
these girls have it, diva!

55:09.432 --> 55:11.559
Oh, my God.

55:12.601 --> 55:15.146
Hi, Gina!

55:16.063 --> 55:17.690
You like it?
Isn't it cute?

55:17.982 --> 55:20.526
And don't look over here, honey.
Darnelle did that.

55:20.818 --> 55:22.445
- It look good, right?
- It sure do.

55:24.196 --> 55:25.990
- Right?
- Right.

55:27.325 --> 55:29.535
I just said,
"When in Rome..."

55:38.586 --> 55:39.712
Don't shake that baby loose.

55:40.004 --> 55:43.674
Oh, Lord. Don't do that or we gon' get
indecency charges up in here.

55:43.966 --> 55:46.344
See, I'm not one of these
so-called salad-chompin' sistahs

55:46.635 --> 55:49.597
that weighs 52 pounds
with a wet T-shin.' on.

55:49.889 --> 55:53.351
I got hips, thighs and don't discriminate
against pies, you feel me?

55:53.642 --> 55:57.229
But, ladies, y'all with this gettin'
your stomach stapled just to lose weight?

55:57.521 --> 55:58.731
That ain't good.

55:59.023 --> 56:02.151
Y'all know damn well that ain't no staples
in the stomach gonna stop you

56:02.443 --> 56:04.779
from poppin' one o' yo' mama's
famous biscuits in the mouth.

56:05.071 --> 56:06.864
Am I in line?

56:07.156 --> 56:09.325
Hotlanta, you know Helen's
keepin' it real with you.

56:09.617 --> 56:11.202
Holler back at me.
I'll holler.

56:11.494 --> 56:13.037
Holler!

56:17.750 --> 56:18.834
Be quiet, y'all.
Oprah's on.

56:24.757 --> 56:27.009
- Where you think you goin'?
- I will be right back, okay?

56:27.301 --> 56:28.302
I'll be right back.

56:33.933 --> 56:35.309
That's what I'm talkin' about.

56:36.852 --> 56:40.439
- Gimme some of that thug love.
- Thank you for comin' to see me.

56:40.731 --> 56:41.982
What's happenin' with ya?
How ya livin'?

56:42.274 --> 56:44.568
Oh, man!

56:45.694 --> 56:48.697
I got in some trouble,
and Gina loaned me this money,

56:48.989 --> 56:50.950
so she got me workin' it off
in her salon.

56:51.242 --> 56:53.035
They got you twisted, huh?

56:53.327 --> 56:55.454
Come on, get with the money train
and let's ride.

56:55.746 --> 56:56.914
Money train?

56:57.206 --> 57:00.459
- I got a plan for you, Shorty.
- Oh, hell, yeah.

57:00.751 --> 57:01.752
They'll be a'ight.

57:02.044 --> 57:03.462
- Can we go shopping?
- I hear that.

57:03.754 --> 57:05.297
I got somethin' for you, too.

57:10.594 --> 57:14.432
Word for today is "chutzpah."
It is--if you don't-- do you know that word?

57:17.226 --> 57:20.771
- Who keeps unplugging this?
- It is a Yiddish word that means--

57:24.900 --> 57:30.781
Amazing grace

57:31.073 --> 57:32.450
Shut up, Josephine!

57:34.785 --> 57:38.789
Dang! Are y'all havin' a slumber party?
Y'all didn't invite me?

57:39.081 --> 57:41.709
- Willie, now is not the time!
- A'ight then.

57:42.001 --> 57:43.335
Hey, but I just came by here to tell ya

57:43.627 --> 57:45.671
that I saw that inspector dude
over there at the barber shop.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.257
Damn! Like I need somethin' else
to be worried about.

57:49.049 --> 57:50.801
Look, just hold him off, okay?
I'll be right back.

57:51.093 --> 57:52.595
- I got that, Miss Gina.
- Go on over there with Auntie Lynn.

57:52.887 --> 57:54.638
Go on, go on, get--
come up outta here. Go ahead.

57:58.100 --> 58:01.270
Come on, please be home, Joe.
I can't believe this.

58:02.396 --> 58:04.273
Excuse me, sir,
you wanna buy some candy bars?

58:04.565 --> 58:06.692
- No, thank you.
- I got Kit Kat, Mars, Snickers.

58:06.984 --> 58:08.611
Come on, kid, not tonight.

58:08.903 --> 58:11.238
Please let his sarcastic ass be here.

58:13.032 --> 58:15.493
Please be there,
please be there, please be there.

58:25.044 --> 58:26.045
I need your help.

58:26.962 --> 58:28.714
Okay, let me grab a shirt.

58:31.467 --> 58:33.260
I got--| got cherry, apple.

58:34.345 --> 58:35.804
Okay, well, how 'bout you buy
some candy, right?

58:36.096 --> 58:39.517
And I don't tell the fellas right here
that you got a Rolex in that briefcase.

58:39.808 --> 58:40.768
I don't have a...

58:49.818 --> 58:51.612
All right.
You say you got Blow Pops?

58:51.904 --> 58:53.822
- Blow Pops.
- Every flavor, dawg.

58:54.114 --> 58:56.116
- Okay, I'll have a cherry.
- Five dollars. Okay, yeah.

58:56.408 --> 58:57.535
- You kinda broke.
- All right.

59:04.833 --> 59:06.126
All right, Joe!

59:07.878 --> 59:10.589
Oh, my God!
Thank you, Joe. You saved me.

59:12.466 --> 59:14.635
The generator is only
going to hold for a while.

59:14.927 --> 59:16.220
You need to get this place fixed.

59:16.512 --> 59:17.471
I will.

59:17.763 --> 59:21.976
- I just...I have to find the money to do it.
- You'll pay me later.

59:22.268 --> 59:23.394
I'll help you out.

59:29.692 --> 59:30.818
Bye, ladies.

59:31.110 --> 59:32.611
Bye, Joe.

59:36.657 --> 59:37.866
Miss Norris.

59:39.034 --> 59:42.580
What, are we the only shop
in Atlanta you like to harass?

59:42.871 --> 59:45.958
When Miss Angeline owned this place,
I ain't never seen y'all up in here.

59:46.250 --> 59:47.585
I'm just doing my job.

59:49.003 --> 59:51.338
All right, look,
the generator is just temporary,

59:51.630 --> 59:54.008
but I have an electrician,
he's coming on Monday,

59:54.300 --> 59:55.801
he's gonna rewire
the whole place for me.

59:56.093 --> 59:59.013
It's all very nice, very nice,
but there's a new state regulation

59:59.305 --> 01:00:01.056
that says all hairdryers
of this capacity

01:00:01.348 --> 01:00:03.309
have to have
their own independent wall plug.

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:04.393
This is a new regulation.

01:00:04.685 --> 01:00:06.520
Well, how the hell
am I supposed to know about it?

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:08.063
I just told you.
That's how.

01:00:08.355 --> 01:00:09.607
I just told you.
That's how.

01:00:09.898 --> 01:00:13.485
Get up to speed, Miss Norris.
One more of those...closed for good.

01:00:14.653 --> 01:00:16.405
Ladies.

01:00:16.697 --> 01:00:18.490
A thousand dollars?!

01:00:18.782 --> 01:00:22.119
I mean, it's like I take two steps forward
to get knocked three steps back.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:25.456
Can you go down to the bank
and ask 'em to increase your loan?

01:00:25.748 --> 01:00:29.335
Ask for a increase? I'm barely
keepin' up with the payments I got now.

01:00:29.627 --> 01:00:31.420
I mean, somethin'
gotta turn around for this thing,

01:00:31.712 --> 01:00:33.714
otherwise, it ain't lookin'
too good for the shop.

01:00:34.006 --> 01:00:36.258
No, Gina.
Now, we can do somethin'.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:39.386
I got a little bit stored away.
We can have a garage sale.

01:00:39.678 --> 01:00:41.639
I mean, how much do we need?

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:46.101
Oh, shit!
Excuse me, Lord.

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:48.103
We need Jesus.

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:49.772
Hey, y'all.

01:00:50.856 --> 01:00:54.943
In before dawn.
Good night, Gina.

01:00:57.946 --> 01:01:00.407
- Gina, did you tell her?
- No, I ain't tell her.

01:01:00.699 --> 01:01:02.409
I swear Mama stay mad at me.

01:01:02.701 --> 01:01:03.494
I wonder why.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:05.454
What happened
to "I'll be right back"?

01:01:07.247 --> 01:01:08.207
My bad, Gina.

01:01:08.916 --> 01:01:12.294
Glen just came down from New York,
and I hadn't seen him.

01:01:12.586 --> 01:01:14.046
Girl, he has his own record label,

01:01:14.338 --> 01:01:16.799
and he wants me
to be on his next album.

01:01:17.800 --> 01:01:18.842
You can't even sing.

01:01:20.678 --> 01:01:22.471
A'ight. Look at this.

01:01:26.725 --> 01:01:27.893
What's this?

01:01:28.185 --> 01:01:30.396
That's the bail money that I owe you.

01:01:30.688 --> 01:01:33.148
Glen gave me some cash,
so now we even.

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.733
I don't have to work
in the shop no more.

01:01:35.025 --> 01:01:36.318
What'd you do to get that money?

01:01:36.610 --> 01:01:38.320
Now, Gina, come on, please!

01:01:38.612 --> 01:01:41.073
You know I don't get down
like that, okay?

01:01:41.907 --> 01:01:45.452
But, look, if a dude wanna pay my bills,
I'm gonna let him pay my bills.

01:01:45.744 --> 01:01:48.539
You know what? Shut up, Darnelle,
'cause you sound real stupid right now.

01:01:48.831 --> 01:01:52.376
Okay? You just lazy.
You lazy and you wastin' your life.

01:01:52.668 --> 01:01:54.044
And you wastin' my time!

01:01:54.336 --> 01:01:56.755
Why don't you use
your little money to go buy a clue?

01:02:13.272 --> 01:02:15.816
Stacy, I don't understand.

01:02:16.108 --> 01:02:18.444
Joanne Marcus
was supposed to be here at 10:00.

01:02:18.736 --> 01:02:22.489
And this is not a coffee shop.
If you want to eat, you eat in the back.

01:02:43.635 --> 01:02:45.387
Doughnuts!

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:48.515
You killin' me, D.
Come on, now.

01:02:48.807 --> 01:02:51.602
If you change your mind and you
don't want any, they'll be in the back.

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:54.563
And I'll even restock
the shelves while I'm at it.

01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:01.361
Joanne Marcus!
Terri, where'd you find her?

01:03:01.653 --> 01:03:02.821
Look at you!

01:03:03.113 --> 01:03:05.282
Oh, why not? Everyone else is.

01:03:06.033 --> 01:03:07.034
You grew.

01:03:07.326 --> 01:03:08.452
Yes, I did.

01:03:08.744 --> 01:03:11.330
Eight thousand a pop.
Had my nipples done, too.

01:03:11.622 --> 01:03:12.372
You wanna feel them?

01:03:12.664 --> 01:03:14.041
Maybe later.

01:03:14.333 --> 01:03:16.543
I ran into Joanne
down at Saks and told her

01:03:16.835 --> 01:03:19.046
how wonderful your new place was
and dragged her down to see you.

01:03:19.338 --> 01:03:21.340
And not a moment too soon.
Girl, what you doin' with that hair?

01:03:21.632 --> 01:03:23.634
I know.
My hair misses you, Gina.

01:03:23.926 --> 01:03:25.803
Well, your timin' is good.
My chair is open.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.599
Girl! I got the same purse.

01:03:30.891 --> 01:03:33.519
Did you get yours from Bernard
at the Piggly Wiggly in Decatur?

01:03:33.811 --> 01:03:34.937
Piggly Wiggly?

01:03:35.229 --> 01:03:37.022
Yeah. He sells thongs, too.

01:03:40.818 --> 01:03:41.735
He works here?

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.737
That he does.

01:03:44.029 --> 01:03:46.824
Gina, is that monkey-fish cat-bread lady
gonna be here today?

01:03:58.252 --> 01:03:59.169
Bitch.

01:04:05.551 --> 01:04:08.178
So, if you had to take a wild guess,
how many grams of fat

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.389
would you say
are in a plate of your greens?

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.266
Baby, my greens is all fat.

01:04:12.558 --> 01:04:15.352
Matter of fact, I found every fat
you could find to put in my greens.

01:04:15.644 --> 01:04:18.689
I got fatback, salt pork,
Vienna sausage, ham slices,

01:04:18.981 --> 01:04:21.900
pork chop, pork rinds,
and I got bacon bits in these greens.

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.402
- Talk dirty to me!
- That's right.

01:04:23.694 --> 01:04:24.945
Say it with me. "Fat is good."

01:04:25.237 --> 01:04:27.698
- Fat is good.
- That's right. Sho nuff is!

01:04:27.990 --> 01:04:30.868
- You should cater.
- Baby, franchise. Think big.

01:04:31.159 --> 01:04:33.787
Please tell me you have some
of that magic potion hair stuff for me.

01:04:34.079 --> 01:04:35.163
You know I do.

01:04:36.164 --> 01:04:37.958
Some 0' your magic what-what?

01:04:38.250 --> 01:04:39.042
It's not no magic.

01:04:39.334 --> 01:04:41.503
It's just some conditioner
that I mix up in my kitchen. What?

01:04:41.795 --> 01:04:44.923
Mix up in yo' kitchen?
What is it? Hair crack?

01:04:46.717 --> 01:04:49.428
The stuff is great.
They should be sellin' it in stores!

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.763
They should.
They really should.

01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.933
Gina, I know a few corporate vendors
on the beauty supply side.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:57.060
They're always lookin'
for the next big thing.

01:04:57.352 --> 01:04:59.229
Well, hey, you know
I wanna be the next big thing.

01:04:59.521 --> 01:05:01.982
Well, float me a few bottles,
I'll see what I can do.

01:05:02.274 --> 01:05:03.442
Girl, I will float you a damn case.

01:05:03.734 --> 01:05:06.695
Why you holdin' out, Gina?
Hook us up with some 0' your hair crack.

01:05:06.987 --> 01:05:08.864
It is not hair crack. It's conditioner.

01:05:09.156 --> 01:05:11.199
Yeah, Gina, hook us up!

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.913
Either you got a bee sting
of the breasts

01:05:16.204 --> 01:05:18.790
or you got some serious work
done to your bosom area.

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:21.043
I sure did and I love 'em.

01:05:21.335 --> 01:05:23.754
Well, for $8,000 a pop,
you better love 'em.

01:05:24.046 --> 01:05:25.297
Hold up, Heidi.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:30.135
You paid 8,000
American dollars...per titty?

01:05:30.427 --> 01:05:31.887
Yes, I did.

01:05:32.179 --> 01:05:34.681
Girl, you coulda bought
yourself a Saturn with that.

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.935
Now, you see all this right here,
all this ludicrousness goin' on here?

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:41.688
Okay, this implant, plastic surgery stuff?
It's more of a white girl thing.

01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:44.775
No, Chanel.
Black girls get it done, too.

01:05:45.067 --> 01:05:45.901
I'm not sayin' we don't.

01:05:46.193 --> 01:05:48.946
I'm just sayin', you know,
we don't get all crazy like y'all do.

01:05:49.237 --> 01:05:51.949
You know, injecting your asses
in your lips is just nasty.

01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:53.033
Girl, who you tellin'?

01:05:53.325 --> 01:05:56.536
Now, I may get a couple
0' unruly back or chest hairs plucked,

01:05:56.828 --> 01:05:59.164
other than that,
I just be chillin'. I don't...

01:06:03.502 --> 01:06:04.378
What?

01:06:05.337 --> 01:06:08.632
So, what I'm saying is,
you know, some folks, you know,

01:06:08.924 --> 01:06:13.053
have to pay to look good,
while other are just born that way.

01:06:13.345 --> 01:06:14.513
It's the Motherland, baby.

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.640
Well, which way were you born,
ass-backwards?

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:20.143
Because statements
like that just personifies your ignorance

01:06:20.435 --> 01:06:22.896
as it pertains to the topic of beauty.

01:06:26.817 --> 01:06:31.446
Excuse me? I know Botox Barbie
isn't tryin' to call me ignorant.

01:06:31.738 --> 01:06:33.365
- I heard her say "your mama."
- Hey, calm down, hussies.

01:06:33.657 --> 01:06:35.742
This ain't no remake
0' "Black Mama, White Mama"!

01:06:36.034 --> 01:06:37.369
I throw the peace card on ya.

01:06:37.661 --> 01:06:38.829
Thank you, Miss Josephine.

01:06:39.121 --> 01:06:42.124
Come on, let's go get this hair done.
So you need to shampoo...

01:06:50.966 --> 01:06:53.385
Does he ever leave that apartment?

01:06:55.470 --> 01:06:57.139
That piano playin'
is gettin' on my nerves.

01:06:58.056 --> 01:07:00.100
Which is why you
haven't patched up the ceiling yet.

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:04.229
Excuse you.
I've been busy, "mademoiselle."

01:07:04.521 --> 01:07:07.399
Why don't you get your things together
so I can take you to church to practice?

01:07:08.734 --> 01:07:10.819
Have you decided
what you wanna play for your recital yet?

01:08:20.721 --> 01:08:21.932
Shoot.

01:08:28.729 --> 01:08:34.152
I was just...
checkin' out your big...spear.

01:08:34.903 --> 01:08:36.113
Sorry.

01:08:37.988 --> 01:08:39.323
Would you like to join us?

01:08:39.616 --> 01:08:41.952
Can you show me the intervals again?

01:08:42.243 --> 01:08:45.455
Well, each chord progression
is three steps apart.

01:08:50.794 --> 01:08:53.421
See? That's why
he called it "Giant Steps."

01:08:53.712 --> 01:08:56.133
You won't hear anybody
playin' this at my recital.

01:08:56.424 --> 01:08:59.970
- So what are you gonna play?
- I don't know.

01:09:00.679 --> 01:09:03.180
- I'm all confused.
- What are you confused about?

01:09:03.473 --> 01:09:04.683
Listen to your heart...

01:09:06.852 --> 01:09:08.353
...and your fingers will follow.

01:09:19.573 --> 01:09:23.076
So, this next song
goes out to all the finger-in-your-face,

01:09:23.368 --> 01:09:25.287
callin'-me-out-my-name heifers.

01:09:25.578 --> 01:09:27.622
You can get all up
in my face if you want to,

01:09:27.913 --> 01:09:29.124
but don't get it twisted, baby,

01:09:29.416 --> 01:09:30.332
'cause guess what?

01:09:35.546 --> 01:09:37.924
Well, I'll take your man
right out the box

01:09:38.216 --> 01:09:40.176
And put him
under my padlocks

01:09:40.468 --> 01:09:42.679
So when you see us together
chillin' in the place

01:09:42.970 --> 01:09:44.973
Cold walkin' and sportin' him
in your face

01:09:45.265 --> 01:09:47.350
Go ahead, roll your eyes,
suck your teeth

01:09:47.642 --> 01:09:49.769
Keep huffin' and puffin'
like a dog in heat

01:09:50.060 --> 01:09:52.022
You know whassup
I ain't no poo-putt

01:09:52.314 --> 01:09:55.525
'Cause Pepa kicks butt off
young bucks like you

01:09:55.817 --> 01:09:57.068
And the rest of your crew

01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.362
If moms want static
I'll diss her, too

01:09:59.654 --> 01:10:01.865
So scram,
you know who I am

01:10:02.157 --> 01:10:03.575
Damn, chick,
don't play me close

01:10:03.867 --> 01:10:04.784
'Cause I'll take your m--

01:10:11.583 --> 01:10:13.752
You know, I was just...

01:10:14.044 --> 01:10:15.170
Takin' someone's man?

01:10:18.298 --> 01:10:20.342
I'll take your man

01:10:20.634 --> 01:10:22.219
So I'm not playin'
any Beethoven or Mozart.

01:10:22.510 --> 01:10:26.181
Too overdone.
I'm thinkin' Coltrane or Monk.

01:10:26.473 --> 01:10:27.891
Too overdone.
I'm thinkin' Coltrane or Monk.

01:10:28.183 --> 01:10:31.686
Then again, some Miles
or Stevie Wonder. Maybe some--

01:10:31.978 --> 01:10:34.397
Girl, go and play
with your little friend, please.

01:10:36.524 --> 01:10:37.400
Clown.

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:38.485
Yo, whassup, V?

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:41.071
- Still shootin' behinds, huh?
- Yup.

01:10:41.363 --> 01:10:44.324
The booty is the cornerstone
of all hip-hop videos today.

01:10:44.616 --> 01:10:46.326
If it ain't shakin', it ain't sellin'.

01:10:46.618 --> 01:10:47.410
Whatever.

01:10:47.702 --> 01:10:50.372
Are you down for some Krispy Kreme?
I got the hook-up.

01:10:50.664 --> 01:10:52.165
My play cousin, Howard,
works over there.

01:10:52.457 --> 01:10:55.502
He got shrimp doughnuts.
He got buffalo doughnuts...

01:10:55.794 --> 01:10:58.505
He got...big booty doughnuts.

01:10:58.797 --> 01:10:59.673
No, you didn't.

01:10:59.965 --> 01:11:02.509
I don't eat doughnuts
with boys who exploit women.

01:11:02.801 --> 01:11:03.677
Well, how about a burger, then?

01:11:03.969 --> 01:11:07.055
I don't want any of your shrimp burgers
or your buffalo burgers.

01:11:07.347 --> 01:11:10.058
So, you and your two play cousins
can get to steppin'!

01:11:10.350 --> 01:11:12.185
See, that's why I like older women.

01:11:14.604 --> 01:11:15.855
There's one 0' your men.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:22.028
- I'll be right back.
- That's what you always say.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.863
I don't know if she's a ho or not.

01:11:24.155 --> 01:11:26.658
I ain't gon' say nothin'
'cause that's Gina's sister-in-law.

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:31.705
Hey, baby.

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:35.208
- Are you happy to see me?
- Hey, baby.

01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:38.378
- You're so sweet.
- Thank you.

01:11:38.670 --> 01:11:40.213
This is how sweet you are.

01:11:41.923 --> 01:11:44.259
Oh, my good--Is that for me?
Oh, baby.

01:11:44.551 --> 01:11:47.512
You and only...you.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:49.597
So here's the plan.
Let's get outta here.

01:11:49.889 --> 01:11:52.767
Go get a drink, listen to some music,
just chill out for the rest of the day.

01:11:53.059 --> 01:11:55.186
- How's that sound?
- Baby, it sounds so good.

01:11:55.478 --> 01:11:58.231
I wish I could, but I gotta work.

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.358
Baby, don't work the whole day away.
I'll bring you back.

01:12:00.650 --> 01:12:03.028
I know, but you know what?
I've really gotta work, 'cause Gin--

01:12:03.320 --> 01:12:04.612
I'm tryin' to get close to you.

01:12:04.904 --> 01:12:07.157
Gina needs me, okay, baby?
Thank you.

01:12:07.449 --> 01:12:09.200
I don't give a damn about no Gina!

01:12:09.993 --> 01:12:11.453
Don't you ever grab me up like that!

01:12:11.745 --> 01:12:13.079
You know how much money
I just spent on you?

01:12:13.371 --> 01:12:15.665
- What the hell?
- Gina, you all right?

01:12:16.416 --> 01:12:17.625
What's this goin' on?

01:12:18.293 --> 01:12:20.503
Shut your rantin' ass
and get in my car, you hear me?

01:12:20.795 --> 01:12:22.047
- Hell, no!
- D, you all right?

01:12:22.339 --> 01:12:24.424
I know I just didn't see you
put yo' hands on that girl.

01:12:24.716 --> 01:12:25.675
Take your ass back in there,
do some heads.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.260
Don't be tellin' me
where to take my ass.

01:12:27.552 --> 01:12:28.887
You take your ass
from the front of my shop!

01:12:29.179 --> 01:12:30.764
- Bitch, get out of my f--
- Bitch?

01:12:31.056 --> 01:12:33.099
I will burn yo' ass
with this damn curlin' iron.

01:12:33.391 --> 01:12:35.101
- Careful with that.
- You're crazy, you fake-ass Avon!

01:12:35.393 --> 01:12:36.603
But you need to keep
your hands to yourself.

01:12:36.895 --> 01:12:38.355
- I'll be back.
- Don't try to call me some type of bi--

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:40.065
- What you? What you?
- What?

01:12:40.357 --> 01:12:41.483
When you gonna do
some hair? What you?

01:12:41.775 --> 01:12:43.485
- I'll burn yo' ass.
- Hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:12:43.777 --> 01:12:46.237
- We got a problem here?
- No, we ain't got no problem here, man.

01:12:46.529 --> 01:12:47.989
What you,
the mascot of the shop?

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:49.324
Take yo' foo-foo ass
back in there.

01:12:49.616 --> 01:12:51.618
Go braid your eyebrows
or somethin', dawgs.

01:12:52.786 --> 01:12:53.912
Check this out, dude.

01:12:55.914 --> 01:12:57.665
Did you see that?

01:12:59.125 --> 01:13:00.126
I hate violence.

01:13:02.087 --> 01:13:03.088
See? That's what you get.

01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:06.925
You come here talkin' all that stuff
and you got knocked out!

01:13:07.217 --> 01:13:10.595
See, that's why you need to learn
how to respect women.

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:15.809
Now, see, Willie got it all on camera
and he sell 'em in the hood for 14.99!

01:13:41.793 --> 01:13:44.504
Well, I'll be damned!

01:13:46.089 --> 01:13:47.257
I'm gonna get him.

01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:52.220
Remember me?

01:13:53.388 --> 01:13:55.056
Oh, ja. The shampooing girl.

01:13:55.348 --> 01:13:57.225
So, how goes it
with the shampooing? Good?

01:13:57.517 --> 01:14:02.147
The name is Lynn,
and I'm a stylist now, for your F.Y.I.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:03.773
So?

01:14:07.235 --> 01:14:09.404
So...yup.

01:14:11.197 --> 01:14:13.658
Well, well, well,
you must be lost or somethin'.

01:14:13.950 --> 01:14:16.244
Did you make a wrong turn
in your BMW?

01:14:16.536 --> 01:14:19.414
No, actually, I took the "Yaguar,"
and it's good to see you, too, Gina.

01:14:20.206 --> 01:14:21.166
He's in the "Yaguar."

01:14:21.458 --> 01:14:23.293
Sorry, I thought
you were in the Beamer.

01:14:23.585 --> 01:14:24.377
Anyway, what do you want?

01:14:24.669 --> 01:14:26.004
Gina, I am Jorge.

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:28.715
I want for nothing.
I just came by to see the shop.

01:14:29.007 --> 01:14:31.843
I was curious about the place
that's been stealing all of my best clients.

01:14:32.135 --> 01:14:34.888
Now I see why.
It's very trendy.

01:14:35.180 --> 01:14:37.557
Very SoHo-loftish.
I love it.

01:14:37.849 --> 01:14:39.642
I guess I'm not doin' too bad,
you know,

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:42.437
'specially for a woman
who should be fallin' flat on her ass.

01:14:43.354 --> 01:14:45.106
Ja, well...about that,

01:14:45.398 --> 01:14:48.193
you know, Gina, I want you to know
I'm truly sorry for my words.

01:14:48.485 --> 01:14:50.153
I was speaking
from that angry place,

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:53.114
and I do not wish
to reside there anymore.

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:58.411
I mean, I wish no ill will
upon you or your shop or your peeps.

01:14:58.703 --> 01:15:00.413
I mean, girlfriend,
you are doing it, ja?

01:15:00.705 --> 01:15:01.664
Right?

01:15:02.957 --> 01:15:06.544
It can't be easy, what with the overhead
and the paying of the fine

01:15:06.836 --> 01:15:08.213
and the State Board coming by
at the worst times,

01:15:08.505 --> 01:15:11.549
'cause believe me, baby, I've been there
and back to the other place.

01:15:12.217 --> 01:15:13.134
And your point?

01:15:13.426 --> 01:15:15.970
I just wanted to come by
to say that, you know,

01:15:16.262 --> 01:15:20.767
if you ever need anything,
anything at all, lean on me.

01:15:21.059 --> 01:15:24.145
When you're not strong,
I will be there, you know'?

01:15:24.437 --> 01:15:27.357
I mean, I am Jorge,
and there will always be

01:15:27.649 --> 01:15:30.151
an open chair at Jorge's for Gina, ja?

01:15:30.443 --> 01:15:33.363
Well, thanks, Jorge.
That means a lot comin' from you.

01:15:33.655 --> 01:15:35.573
But I don't think
I'm gonna be needin' that.

01:15:36.533 --> 01:15:40.995
Okay, well, fair enough.
Ciao. Wiedersehen

01:15:46.209 --> 01:15:51.631
Congratulations on the twins,
but I see that they are not identical.

01:15:56.761 --> 01:15:59.681
- What the hell did he want?
- He came over to hate.

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.433
He's just jealous.

01:16:02.725 --> 01:16:06.604
- Who was that?
- That was the infamous Jorge.

01:16:06.896 --> 01:16:07.772
Got some nice shoes, though.

01:16:08.064 --> 01:16:09.232
You got some issues.

01:16:09.524 --> 01:16:12.026
- Gina, who's your girl?
- You are.

01:16:12.318 --> 01:16:15.446
Yes. And who, when asked
to make something happen,

01:16:15.738 --> 01:16:16.906
is making something happen?

01:16:17.198 --> 01:16:18.950
- You again?
- Correct.

01:16:19.242 --> 01:16:21.286
And who was it
that talked up your conditioner

01:16:21.578 --> 01:16:23.746
to the head of marketing
for CoverGirls line of boutique products?

01:16:24.038 --> 01:16:25.582
And why do they
want to meet with you?

01:16:25.873 --> 01:16:27.875
- Don't play with me. I can't take it.
- I'm serious.

01:16:28.167 --> 01:16:30.253
They wanna meet with you,
fly you to New York, talk some business.

01:16:30.545 --> 01:16:33.298
They wanna fly me
to New York? Me?!

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:34.549
Oh, my God!

01:16:35.341 --> 01:16:37.218
- What?
- Thank you, Joanne!

01:16:37.510 --> 01:16:39.429
- What's up?
- Oh, my God! Thank you!

01:16:39.721 --> 01:16:41.389
Oh, my God!

01:16:41.681 --> 01:16:45.059
CoverGirl.
"CoverGirl" is interested in my conditioner.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:48.021
I can't believe it!

01:16:48.313 --> 01:16:50.732
- You talkin' about that hair crack?
- Yes, I'm talkin' about the ha--

01:16:51.024 --> 01:16:53.318
They can call it whatever they want,
as long as they sell it.

01:16:53.610 --> 01:16:55.653
You hear me?
I feel like I just won the lottery.

01:16:55.945 --> 01:16:57.071
That's great, it's brilliant.

01:16:57.363 --> 01:16:58.740
Why don't you feel
like takin' us out to celebrate?

01:16:59.032 --> 01:17:00.700
- Oh, yeah, man.
- I think I can do that.

01:17:00.992 --> 01:17:03.077
We got to toast on this somewhere.

01:17:03.369 --> 01:17:06.873
I can't drink, but I sure can eat
Cosmopolitan cheesecake!

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:13.296
Tonight we goin' out and we celebratin'.
We are gettin' it on, we gettin' tipsy--

01:17:13.588 --> 01:17:15.840
Go on. Go sit your butt down.

01:17:16.132 --> 01:17:19.677
We goin' out tonight! We partyin'!
Joanne, please.

01:17:21.554 --> 01:17:23.139
- Hey, Joe.
- Hey, little one.

01:17:23.431 --> 01:17:25.683
Guess what? CoverGirl
might buy my mom's conditioner.

01:17:25.975 --> 01:17:28.603
So her and the girls
are goin' out tonight to celebrate.

01:17:29.646 --> 01:17:32.815
Thought maybe you'd wanna come
and meet them there?

01:17:33.650 --> 01:17:35.735
I'm not sure she wants me there.

01:17:36.027 --> 01:17:39.197
But tell your mom I said congratulations.
That's great news.

01:17:41.032 --> 01:17:44.452
- Talk to you later.
- Keep practicing.

01:18:01.052 --> 01:18:02.512
Hey, baby.

01:18:04.055 --> 01:18:05.598
- Look at that girl over there.
- For real.

01:18:05.890 --> 01:18:09.227
Girl, if I wasn't married, pregnant,
and my feet didn't hurt,

01:18:09.519 --> 01:18:12.105
I'd get with one
of these little chocolate kisses.

01:18:12.397 --> 01:18:15.650
Yup. I can definitely see
why they call it Happy Hour!

01:18:15.942 --> 01:18:18.695
Please, honey, Happy Hour
ended a long time ago.

01:18:18.986 --> 01:18:21.531
- It is Get Crunked Hour, okay?
- All right.

01:18:21.823 --> 01:18:24.158
Okay, ladies...and James,

01:18:24.450 --> 01:18:27.537
I just want to say thank you so much
for hangin' in there with me, y'all.

01:18:29.372 --> 01:18:31.207
You thought you wanted a Jorge's,

01:18:31.499 --> 01:18:33.876
but you belong right here
in the 'hood with us.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.254
- A'ight?
- Right. You ain't lyin'.

01:18:36.546 --> 01:18:39.716
I ain't gonna front. When I met y'all
at Miss Angeline's that mornin',

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:41.426
I thought I was in for the worst.

01:18:41.718 --> 01:18:43.386
- What?
- And that's what I got.

01:18:43.678 --> 01:18:46.848
Until them two birds left the shop,
and then I had the best!

01:18:47.140 --> 01:18:48.349
All right, we'll toast to that.

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:53.104
Ah, yes, yes, I do.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:57.024
To Gina.
Sistah, you are an inspiration.

01:18:57.316 --> 01:19:01.904
"Whether it's the arch 0' your back
or the sun 0' your smile,

01:19:02.196 --> 01:19:06.784
"the ride 0' your breasts
or the grace 0' your style.

01:19:07.076 --> 01:19:12.165
"You are and always will be
a woman phenomenally.

01:19:12.457 --> 01:19:15.918
Phenomenal woman!"
That's you.

01:19:16.210 --> 01:19:17.503
Yes, it is.

01:19:18.629 --> 01:19:20.882
Congratulations, Gina.
Would you like to dance?

01:19:21.174 --> 01:19:22.425
What are you doing here?

01:19:22.717 --> 01:19:24.635
Asking you to dance.

01:19:24.927 --> 01:19:27.555
Now, please, say yes so it can look
like I have a little bit of game.

01:19:27.847 --> 01:19:30.183
- Okay.
- Oh, my God, girl!

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:36.439
- I wanna get tribal with y'all.
- That was like 1989.

01:19:36.731 --> 01:19:39.025
Okay, hand me the scissor.

01:19:42.820 --> 01:19:43.738
So, Lynn...

01:19:45.406 --> 01:19:46.449
You wanna move a little somethin'?

01:19:47.492 --> 01:19:48.326
Move what?

01:19:48.618 --> 01:19:50.244
He askin' you to dance, crazy girl.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:54.791
I thought he wanted me
to move some chairs or somethin'!

01:19:57.251 --> 01:20:00.713
- Sure.
- All right, go have fun.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.049
- Go ahead.
- Go on, now.

01:20:03.341 --> 01:20:05.468
Her gonna need
some scissor, for real.

01:20:05.760 --> 01:20:08.429
Did you see that?
Did you see that?

01:20:08.721 --> 01:20:11.849
All these beautiful black girls
and he goes straight for the white girl.

01:20:12.141 --> 01:20:14.352
I'm tellin' you, MTV is the devil.

01:20:14.644 --> 01:20:16.854
Girl, what is wrong with you?
Okay, who gives a damn?

01:20:17.146 --> 01:20:19.106
The boy is gayer than Peter Pan
on a pair 0' ice skates.

01:20:30.910 --> 01:20:32.036
Okay, you know what?

01:20:48.761 --> 01:20:50.429
- She dropped it like it's hot!
- Oh, damn!

01:21:04.443 --> 01:21:08.155
- I think we're bein' outdone.
- What? You think?

01:21:16.706 --> 01:21:19.208
- What?!
- James is gay, all right.

01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.127
He happier than hell!

01:21:25.423 --> 01:21:26.632
- Girls...
- Yeah, let's go.

01:21:26.924 --> 01:21:28.759
- I see somethin' I need. Come on, now.
- I'ma show her how you really do that.

01:21:29.051 --> 01:21:29.969
Come on.

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:41.981
This goes out to my girl Gina.

01:21:42.273 --> 01:21:46.068
Some old school
Chicago steppin' music, girl.

01:21:50.072 --> 01:21:51.282
- That's my song.
- Come on.

01:22:24.148 --> 01:22:25.232
Is this your family?

01:22:26.734 --> 01:22:29.695
My happily married sister
and her two kids.

01:22:29.987 --> 01:22:31.030
They live in France.

01:22:31.322 --> 01:22:33.574
Well, what about a wife and kids?

01:22:35.493 --> 01:22:36.911
That never happen for you?

01:22:39.622 --> 01:22:41.832
Many things
never happened for me.

01:22:52.551 --> 01:22:54.053
And many things have.

01:23:03.521 --> 01:23:05.690
I don't think I'm really...

01:23:25.668 --> 01:23:28.087
You just played
the most beautiful chord ever.

01:23:58.367 --> 01:24:00.536
- Pass the ball!
- Oh, really?

01:24:04.707 --> 01:24:06.125
Come on, man, pass the ball!

01:24:22.016 --> 01:24:24.393
Gotta make sure you arrive safely.

01:24:28.564 --> 01:24:31.650
Oh, my goodness.
That's it.

01:24:33.152 --> 01:24:35.446
A case of my future
is on its way to CoverGirl.

01:24:35.738 --> 01:24:38.491
Okay, now, listen. If they call you
and they need some more--

01:24:38.783 --> 01:24:40.493
No, Gina. This is more than enough.

01:24:40.826 --> 01:24:43.037
- Let's not get frantic, okay?
- Okay.

01:24:46.290 --> 01:24:48.084
Come on, stop doin' that.

01:24:49.335 --> 01:24:52.880
Could you carry this to my car for me?
It's just outside.

01:24:53.172 --> 01:24:55.925
- Yeah, I'll take it.
- Thanks.

01:24:59.512 --> 01:25:00.763
Firm.

01:25:05.601 --> 01:25:07.269
Excuse me, Joanne.

01:25:08.145 --> 01:25:10.231
Would you mind
not doing that anymore?

01:25:10.523 --> 01:25:11.398
Doing what?

01:25:11.690 --> 01:25:14.401
You know, the whole
smacking-on-the-butt thing.

01:25:14.693 --> 01:25:18.155
James and I are kinda,
you know, hanging out now.

01:25:18.447 --> 01:25:20.157
I didn't know you guys were...

01:25:20.449 --> 01:25:21.450
Yes, we are.

01:25:21.742 --> 01:25:23.244
So, you understand.

01:25:23.536 --> 01:25:24.870
Yeah, I understand...

01:25:26.497 --> 01:25:28.124
...that you're afraid
of a little competition.

01:25:30.251 --> 01:25:32.753
What's the matter, Lynn?
You afraid James might grow tired

01:25:33.045 --> 01:25:37.341
of your wannabe-black girl routine
and fall for somethin' real, like me?

01:25:38.259 --> 01:25:39.468
Real?

01:25:39.760 --> 01:25:42.221
Since when are two air bags
for breasts real, Joanne?

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:44.223
Maybe on my daddy's Chevy
they's real,

01:25:44.515 --> 01:25:46.684
but on you,
they's just...ridiculous.

01:25:49.061 --> 01:25:49.937
Excuse me?

01:25:50.229 --> 01:25:51.313
You heard me.

01:25:51.605 --> 01:25:52.898
Yeah, but I think I shouldn't have.

01:25:53.190 --> 01:25:54.066
Yeah, but you did.

01:25:54.358 --> 01:25:56.944
And I think what my girl
is sayin' is that she wants you

01:25:57.236 --> 01:25:59.446
and your tetherball titties
to leave her man alone, all right?

01:25:59.738 --> 01:26:03.325
Okay, Little Miss Hip-Hop,
I think I was speaking to Lynn.

01:26:03.617 --> 01:26:05.327
White girl gone crazy.

01:26:05.619 --> 01:26:07.997
What did you say to me?
Little Miss Hip-Hop?

01:26:08.289 --> 01:26:10.749
- I will hip-hop my foot up--
- She threatened me.

01:26:11.041 --> 01:26:13.878
- Did you hear that, Gina?
- Yeah, I heard all y'all.

01:26:14.170 --> 01:26:16.630
I'm the client.
She should be fired. Right now!

01:26:17.381 --> 01:26:19.842
Joanne, calm down.
You know how we clown around here.

01:26:20.134 --> 01:26:22.595
Now, look, y'all are grown women.
Y'all can work this out.

01:26:22.887 --> 01:26:23.888
So you're not gonna fire her?

01:26:24.180 --> 01:26:25.472
No.

01:26:30.686 --> 01:26:33.189
Okay, fine. Yeah.

01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:35.316
I see how things work around here.

01:26:35.608 --> 01:26:38.485
You know what? You can forget
about your meeting with CoverGirl.

01:26:38.777 --> 01:26:40.571
And you can forget
about me as a client.

01:26:40.863 --> 01:26:41.822
How's that?

01:26:47.286 --> 01:26:50.456
- Fine.
- I'm so sorry, Gina.

01:26:50.748 --> 01:26:53.083
No. Ain't nothin'
to be sorry about.

01:26:53.375 --> 01:26:55.211
I guess
it just wasn't meant to be.

01:27:13.103 --> 01:27:14.230
What's going on?

01:27:16.273 --> 01:27:17.942
There's a problem at the shop.

01:27:53.185 --> 01:27:56.730
I still have men checking the area.
I'll let you know if we find something.

01:27:58.107 --> 01:27:59.483
Thanks.

01:28:15.374 --> 01:28:18.627
You try doin' your own thing,
and then somethin' like this happens.

01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:23.924
Sorry, Gina.
I'm so sorry this happened to you.

01:28:27.011 --> 01:28:29.805
I can't catch a break. I just--

01:28:36.937 --> 01:28:39.315
I have Vanessa's recital tomorrow,

01:28:39.606 --> 01:28:43.027
and I have to go up in there
with all 0' this on my brain.

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:46.780
It's okay, Gina.
You'll get through this.

01:28:48.657 --> 01:28:52.786
- You'll get through this.
- I wish that was true, Joe.

01:28:53.078 --> 01:28:54.038
You will.

01:28:59.043 --> 01:29:00.252
It's okay.

01:29:00.544 --> 01:29:05.007
No. I can't--
I can't fix this one. I can't.

01:29:11.805 --> 01:29:17.227
And now, coming to the stage
for a piano solo...Vanessa Norris.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:51.804
Play from your heart.

01:30:18.163 --> 01:30:21.208
Go, baby. That's my baby girl.

01:30:22.918 --> 01:30:24.169
Everything's gonna be all right.

01:30:24.461 --> 01:30:26.380
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you, too.

01:30:57.369 --> 01:31:00.122
That's my baby! That's my baby!

01:31:09.465 --> 01:31:11.383
Mom, how'd I do?

01:31:12.634 --> 01:31:14.178
You were everything
lever imagined.

01:31:19.808 --> 01:31:22.060
Mom...you okay?

01:31:22.352 --> 01:31:24.146
Yeah. I'm fine.

01:31:24.438 --> 01:31:25.689
I'm just happy.

01:31:25.981 --> 01:31:27.774
Come here.

01:31:28.066 --> 01:31:29.651
Fly me some fingers, girl.

01:31:30.569 --> 01:31:31.695
Let's get outta here.

01:32:18.742 --> 01:32:21.078
Surprise!

01:32:22.454 --> 01:32:24.623
What? What--what the--

01:32:25.374 --> 01:32:27.876
Y'all, I don't know what to say.
This is...

01:32:28.168 --> 01:32:29.378
This is crazy.

01:32:29.670 --> 01:32:32.714
No. This is Gina's House of...

01:32:33.006 --> 01:32:36.009
House of...Okay, maybe
it's just Gina's House, okay?

01:32:38.971 --> 01:32:40.639
Check that out. Oh, yeah!

01:32:42.474 --> 01:32:45.644
D, that's what I'm talkin' about, girl!

01:32:45.936 --> 01:32:47.563
Oh, man,y'all...

01:32:48.772 --> 01:32:50.399
This is nice.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:52.484
It is.

01:32:54.736 --> 01:32:56.071
But I don't think we can do this.

01:32:56.363 --> 01:32:57.781
Why not?

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:01.785
We brought blow dryers
and curlin' irons and hot c--

01:33:02.077 --> 01:33:04.288
A new picture
of Madam C.J. Walker.

01:33:04.580 --> 01:33:09.751
- Money. Did you bring any 0' that?
- The point is, Gina, we're here.

01:33:10.043 --> 01:33:12.879
The shop's here!
We're with you.

01:33:13.797 --> 01:33:18.510
Lord! It is hotter
than a jalapeno's coochie out there!

01:33:19.303 --> 01:33:20.679
Thank God y'all open.

01:33:20.971 --> 01:33:25.017
Child, I done been to five shops in four
blocks and all them bitches is booked.

01:33:25.309 --> 01:33:27.436
And I got a weddin'
to get to in three hours!

01:33:27.728 --> 01:33:31.148
Lord, please, can somebody
do me? Please?

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:33.275
Anybody, please.

01:33:37.446 --> 01:33:39.156
Yeah, sure. I'll hook you up, girl.

01:33:39.448 --> 01:33:41.116
Let me see
what we workin' with under this hat.

01:33:42.034 --> 01:33:43.744
- Damn!
- Oh, my God!

01:33:44.036 --> 01:33:45.329
- Hear me, Lord!

01:33:45.621 --> 01:33:48.332

- Just one 0' you heifers do me, please!
- Okay, okay.

01:33:54.129 --> 01:33:55.422
You know what?
I can work with this.

01:33:55.714 --> 01:33:57.466
- Don't even worry about it.
- Thank you.

01:33:58.258 --> 01:34:01.678
Darnelle, get her shampooed
and use a bottle of my conditioner.

01:34:01.970 --> 01:34:04.139
No! Make that two bottles.

01:34:04.431 --> 01:34:07.643
And...James, get that percolator
percolatin', baby.

01:34:07.934 --> 01:34:10.312
We back in business!
Shoot!

01:34:10.604 --> 01:34:12.314
And, everybody else...

01:34:14.733 --> 01:34:15.859
Thank you.

01:34:16.151 --> 01:34:18.320
- Gina, we love you.
- Thank you, thank you.

01:34:18.612 --> 01:34:20.739
That's right, girl,
we open for business.

01:34:22.157 --> 01:34:23.533
- What happened here?
- Good morning.

01:34:23.825 --> 01:34:26.161
Hey, well, put it like this.
Not enough to make us quit.

01:34:26.453 --> 01:34:28.038
- How you doin', girl?
- Fine.

01:34:28.330 --> 01:34:30.248
I'm terrific, actually,
now that Steven and I split up.

01:34:30.540 --> 01:34:32.459
- You all right?
- Yeah. I'm fine.

01:34:32.751 --> 01:34:36.672
Hell, y'all all knew he was cheatin' on me.
Now I know and now I'm free.

01:34:36.963 --> 01:34:40.050
Well, good for you.
Hey, Ida, why don't you hook Terri up?

01:34:40.342 --> 01:34:42.844
- Oh, good. Hi.
- Come on, girl.

01:34:43.136 --> 01:34:45.180
You want me to sic
my cousin Travis on him?

01:34:45.472 --> 01:34:47.766
He just got out the pen,
but he don't mind goin' back early.

01:34:48.058 --> 01:34:50.352
- I just might take you up on that.
- All right, come on, sit down.

01:34:50.644 --> 01:34:54.189
Oh, shoot! Look
what the collard greens did to her booty!

01:34:54.981 --> 01:34:57.192
- Go girl!
- Back that thing up, girl!

01:34:57.484 --> 01:34:58.610
Where'd you get that?

01:34:59.486 --> 01:35:02.280
That is a ass, Terri.
You have a ass, girl!

01:35:05.283 --> 01:35:06.535
- Hi, Gina.
- Hi, honey.

01:35:06.827 --> 01:35:08.120
- For me?
- Something to brighten your day?

01:35:08.412 --> 01:35:10.372
Thank you.

01:35:12.165 --> 01:35:14.793
But you brightened my day
as soon as you came through that door.

01:35:15.585 --> 01:35:17.421
- Excuse me.
- What a transformation.

01:35:17.713 --> 01:35:19.589
Yeah. They hooked me up.

01:35:21.007 --> 01:35:22.843
Looks like you're
stickin' around, Miss Norris.

01:35:23.135 --> 01:35:25.429
- Yeah, I guess I am, huh?
- Yes.

01:35:26.596 --> 01:35:30.100
No, it ain't goin' down like that.
How you doin', Miss Gina?

01:35:30.392 --> 01:35:32.769
- Hey, Willie. What's up wit' you?
- I'm a'ight.

01:35:33.061 --> 01:35:34.521
What, you feelin' froggy? Jump!

01:35:36.064 --> 01:35:37.566
What is this?

01:35:45.449 --> 01:35:49.202
Stacy? Yeah. Hi, baby.
How ya doin'? This is me.

01:35:49.494 --> 01:35:52.706
No, I'm just closing up,
so I'll meet you at the spa, ja?

01:35:58.754 --> 01:35:59.796
I call you back.

01:36:22.319 --> 01:36:23.653
- What a...
- Surprise.

01:36:25.530 --> 01:36:28.617
I bet you I'm the last person on earth
you expected to see in here, huh?

01:36:28.909 --> 01:36:30.994
No. In fact,
I knew you would be back.

01:36:31.953 --> 01:36:35.290
Well, I'm afraid I don't have time
for such a sudden intrusion.

01:36:35.582 --> 01:36:37.292
I have a prior engagement.

01:36:37.584 --> 01:36:41.087
Sorry. I didn't mean to intrude.
What kind 0' engagement?

01:36:41.379 --> 01:36:43.799
What, you goin' to meet up
with Inspector Crawford

01:36:44.090 --> 01:36:45.967
and figure out how you
can burn my place down this time?

01:36:46.259 --> 01:36:50.555
Gina, I just love it when you
let that imagination of yours run wild.

01:36:50.847 --> 01:36:51.932
It's so street.

01:36:52.974 --> 01:36:55.060
You haven't even begun
to see the street.

01:36:55.352 --> 01:36:57.354
You know, I knew you
had somethin' to do with it.

01:36:57.646 --> 01:37:01.441
You know, comin' by my salon, talkin'
'bout how hard it is to own a business,

01:37:01.733 --> 01:37:04.569
what with the payin' 0' fines
and the State Board comin' by.

01:37:05.529 --> 01:37:09.157
And I asked myself,
"Why would he say somethin' like that?"

01:37:11.201 --> 01:37:13.912
Look at me.
Look to Jorge.

01:37:14.204 --> 01:37:15.539
Do I seem
like the type of person

01:37:15.831 --> 01:37:18.583
that would reside
in such deviant behavior, huh?

01:37:21.461 --> 01:37:23.380
With those split ends?
Yeah, you kinda do.

01:37:23.672 --> 01:37:27.217
- What is this?
- That is "World's Dumbest Criminals."

01:37:27.509 --> 01:37:29.177
Starrin' you and Inspector Crawford.

01:37:29.845 --> 01:37:33.348
You should be a little more secretive
about the way you do dirt.

01:37:33.640 --> 01:37:36.101
So...George Christie...

01:37:37.018 --> 01:37:40.397
...of Austria, via Nebraska.

01:37:40.689 --> 01:37:42.691
Yeah, I know about you.
I know your secret.

01:37:44.025 --> 01:37:44.985
The point is this.

01:37:46.278 --> 01:37:49.656
You didn't break me.
I'm still standin'.

01:37:49.948 --> 01:37:53.910
And my shop is open
and doin' very good business.

01:37:54.202 --> 01:37:58.582
And you will never,
ever intimidate me,

01:37:58.874 --> 01:38:00.333
'cause I'm a phenomenal woman.

01:38:00.625 --> 01:38:04.379
Kinda like what you try to be
but don't really pull off.

01:38:07.757 --> 01:38:11.595
Have a nice ride back
to that rib shack you call a shop!

01:38:11.887 --> 01:38:14.764
Don't cut yourself
on the broken glass, bitch!

01:38:15.724 --> 01:38:16.850
Did somebody say "Cut"?

01:38:17.684 --> 01:38:19.519
What? Was ist das?
What?!

01:38:21.730 --> 01:38:24.816
- Sit up, man.
- No! No! Shit!

01:38:30.363 --> 01:38:33.199
Hotlanta! Whassup?

01:38:33.491 --> 01:38:34.701
Once again, it's your girl Helen,

01:38:34.993 --> 01:38:38.705
hollerin' at ya this mornin',
tellin' ya to get your ass up,

01:38:38.997 --> 01:38:40.415
'cause it is a lovely day.

01:38:42.918 --> 01:38:45.378
It's good, right?
It always is.

01:38:45.670 --> 01:38:47.130
Gina, telephone.

01:38:48.757 --> 01:38:50.216
Hello. Gina Norris.

01:38:50.508 --> 01:38:53.178
- Hey, Gina, it's hollerin' Helen.
- Shut up.

01:38:53.470 --> 01:38:56.723
You lyin'.
Turn the radio up, turn it up.

01:38:59.809 --> 01:39:02.562
Gina, y'all doin'
the damn thing down there!

01:39:02.854 --> 01:39:04.522
I'm on the radio!
I'm on the radio!

01:39:06.274 --> 01:39:09.069
Ask her if she'd give a shout out to my kid,
Venus Serena Marion Jones, Junior!

01:39:09.361 --> 01:39:10.487
Shout out to Africa!

01:39:10.779 --> 01:39:13.031
Gina, I just called
to say thanks again

01:39:13.323 --> 01:39:17.077
for hookin' my head up for my cousin
Shondrella's weddin' a couple 0' days ago.

01:39:17.369 --> 01:39:19.371
Girl, you saved my life!

01:39:20.163 --> 01:39:22.123
That hair crack conditioner of yours

01:39:22.415 --> 01:39:24.751
got me lookin'
all Halle Beny-ish and thangs.

01:39:25.043 --> 01:39:28.004
- Don King? That was you?
- Sure was.

01:39:28.296 --> 01:39:30.507
And I'ma need me
a touch-up in a minute.

01:39:30.799 --> 01:39:33.718
My man came over last night
and kinda sweated out my flip!

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:36.721
Now, see, that's what got you
in trouble the last time.

01:39:37.013 --> 01:39:39.307
Hotlanta, if you want
to get your crop dusted,

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:41.476
your do did, or your flip whipped,

01:39:41.768 --> 01:39:43.269
jump yo' butt in the hoopty,

01:39:43.561 --> 01:39:45.939
get on down
to Gina's Hair Salon in the SWATS

01:39:46.231 --> 01:39:50.193
and let 'em hook you up with some
of Gina's famous hair crack conditioner.

01:39:51.611 --> 01:39:53.488
Now, since y'all my peeps,

01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:56.950
I'ma let you ladies in the shop
pick Helen's topic for the day.

01:39:57.242 --> 01:39:58.535
Holler at me, ladies.

01:39:58.827 --> 01:40:00.286
I'll holler!

01:40:01.913 --> 01:40:04.499
Talk about how come there's never
a black man as The Bachelor, okay?

01:40:04.791 --> 01:40:06.209
The revolution needs to be televised.

01:40:06.501 --> 01:40:08.420
You know what? I think you should talk
about people who name their kids

01:40:08.712 --> 01:40:10.213
names that they
ain't never gon' live up to,

01:40:10.505 --> 01:40:12.507
like a Porsche
that look like a Buick

01:40:12.799 --> 01:40:15.593
and a Mercedes
that look like a doggone Pinto!

01:40:15.885 --> 01:40:18.054
Talk about these athletes
goin' to jail these days.

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:20.598
They spend more time in the court
than on the court.

01:40:20.890 --> 01:40:23.685
Keep this up,
halftime gon' be a plea bargain.

01:40:24.978 --> 01:40:27.689
No, talk about interracial love.

01:40:27.981 --> 01:40:28.857
You know you black.

01:40:29.149 --> 01:40:34.070
No, let's talk about legalizin' marijuana,
'cause my glaucoma's gettin' bad now.

01:40:34.362 --> 01:40:35.447
Talk about how
if you have sex with a man,

01:40:35.739 --> 01:40:36.948
he put you out
before he give you breakfast.

01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:40.660
After some good lovin', I like to go
cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs for damn sho'!

01:40:41.619 --> 01:40:42.787
Watch it, y'all!

01:40:43.079 --> 01:40:46.750
Big ups to you, Gina.
I'll be callin' you in a minute for a touch-up.

01:40:47.042 --> 01:40:49.127
Y'all keep holdin' it down.
I'll holler.

01:40:49.419 --> 01:40:51.588
Holler!
