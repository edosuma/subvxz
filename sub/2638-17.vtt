WEBVTT

00:00.850 --> 00:03.080
Okay, Raj.

00:03.100 --> 00:06.110
Hand me the #6 Torx screwdriver.

00:07.370 --> 00:09.200
Stop.

00:09.480 --> 00:11.040
We can't do this. It's not right.

00:11.050 --> 00:13.020
Sheldon, you have two choices.

00:13.060 --> 00:14.910
ther you let him put a
bigger hard drive in the TiVo,

00:14.920 --> 00:16.980
or you delete stuff
before we go out of town.

00:17.010 --> 00:20.550
But once you open the box,
you've voided the warranty.

00:20.560 --> 00:24.540
The warranty is a sacred covenant we've
entered into with the manufacturer.

00:24.570 --> 00:27.510
He offers to stand by his
equipment, and we in return

00:27.520 --> 00:30.130
agree not to violate the
integrity of the internal hardware.

00:30.160 --> 00:35.290
This little orange sticker is all
that stands between us and anarchy.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.470
Okay, then we won't
touch the hard drive.

00:38.510 --> 00:40.640
We'll just erase the
first season of Battlestar.

00:43.390 --> 00:45.400
There. We're outlaws.

00:46.920 --> 00:48.480
Here you go, Leonard. Is
this going to be big enough?

00:48.490 --> 00:50.310
It's perfect.

00:52.900 --> 00:56.660
For taking daffodils to your unicorn.

00:57.370 --> 00:59.540
It's just for my
notebooks. Thanks, Penny.

00:59.550 --> 01:02.310
I love San Francisco. I
wish I was going with you.

01:02.320 --> 01:05.860
I understand your envy.
Thiss a can't-miss symposium.

01:05.870 --> 01:09.760
There are going to be discussions on
bioorganic cellular computer devices,

01:09.790 --> 01:12.380
the advancements in
multi-threaded task completion,

01:12.430 --> 01:15.940
plus a roundtable on the
nonequilibrium Green's function approach

01:15.950 --> 01:18.750
to the photoionization process in atoms.

01:19.490 --> 01:23.020
When I go, I usually just get
hammered and ride the cable cars.

01:23.570 --> 01:25.310
This conference is kind of a big thing.

01:25.340 --> 01:28.110
The keynote address is being
delivered by George Smoot.

01:28.130 --> 01:30.410
Oh, my God, the George Smoot?

01:30.420 --> 01:33.020
- You've heard of him?
- Of course I haven't.

01:34.180 --> 01:39.260
George Smoot is a Nobel Prize-winning
physicist, one of the great minds of our time.

01:39.300 --> 01:43.850
His work in black body form and anisotropy
of the cosmic microwave background radiation

01:43.860 --> 01:47.340
cemented our understanding
of the origin of the universe.

01:47.370 --> 01:51.000
It's kind of a funny
name, though-- "Smoot."

01:54.180 --> 01:56.980
It's like talking to a chimp.

01:57.540 --> 02:00.540
Okay, now that I've been completely
insulted, have a good flight.

02:00.550 --> 02:01.420
Yeah, I wish.

02:01.450 --> 02:03.840
We're not flying.
We're taking the train.

02:03.850 --> 02:05.180
Oh, cool.

02:05.200 --> 02:10.479
Yeah, cool. Seven times as long as
flying, and costs almost twice as much.

02:11.150 --> 02:12.670
Well, then why are you doing it?

02:12.710 --> 02:15.270
Well, we had a vote. Three
of us voted for airplane.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.990
Sheldon voted for train.
So we're taking the trn.

02:20.030 --> 02:21.280
Don't say it like that, Leonard.

02:21.320 --> 02:24.360
Say it like: We're taking the train!

02:51.130 --> 02:53.860
Hey, we're all going over to the Apple store
to make fun of the guys at the Genius Bar.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.610
You want to come?

02:55.620 --> 02:59.260
Oh, I always enjoy that,
but I'm a little busy.

02:59.290 --> 02:59.980
What are you doing?

03:00.010 --> 03:02.880
I'm simplifying the task
of packing for our trip.

03:02.910 --> 03:06.840
See, by attaching RFID tags to my
clothing, it will able my laptop

03:06.850 --> 03:09.500
to read and identify
the items with this wand.

03:09.540 --> 03:13.170
I will then cross-reference them against
destination, anticipated activity spectrum,

03:13.200 --> 03:16.010
weather conditions,
duration of trip, et cetera.

03:19.560 --> 03:22.290
Well, that does sound much simpler.

03:23.300 --> 03:24.710
How long is this going to take?

03:24.760 --> 03:27.510
Assuming I can keep up this
pace, three hours, 11 minutes,

03:27.550 --> 03:31.410
and plus however long tak to conclude
this fairly pointless conversation.

03:33.960 --> 03:37.380
Teasing the guys at the Apple
store seems a little redundant now.

03:37.410 --> 03:40.430
- I don't follow.
- I wouldn't expect you to. I'll see you later.

03:44.060 --> 03:49.330
Socks:one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

03:53.470 --> 03:58.420
Socks: one pair, cotton, argyle, blue.

04:03.060 --> 04:05.550
What on earth are you doing?

04:05.560 --> 04:08.530
Whatever it is, I'm guessing
we're doing it wrong.

04:08.540 --> 04:12.240
Gentlemen, this is the Coast Starlight,

04:12.280 --> 04:17.140
one of the great American trains operating
on one of the classic American routes.

04:17.170 --> 04:22.760
On this side, you'll see panoramic ocean vistas
inaccessible to any other form of transportation,

04:22.800 --> 04:27.250
while on your side, you'll be
treated to 350 miles of CostCos,

04:27.290 --> 04:30.790
Jiffy Lubes, and cinderblock
homes with above-ground pools.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.350
Come on, Raj.

04:34.380 --> 04:36.270
What's wrong with Jiffy Lubes?

04:36.990 --> 04:38.910
No.

04:39.610 --> 04:41.900
- Why not?
- That's over the wheelbase.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.170
Are you completely unfamiliar
with the suspension characteristics

04:45.180 --> 04:48.990
of a pre-1980 Pullman-built
Superliner Deluxe passenger coach?

04:49.370 --> 04:51.520
Sheldon, we've been on
this train 90 seconds,

04:51.570 --> 04:54.080
and you've already
said a thousand words.

04:54.120 --> 04:57.000
Just tell us where to sit and shut up.

04:58.930 --> 05:00.510
Here.

05:00.530 --> 05:06.600
I'm hoping once you reap the endorphic rewards of the
steady clickety-clack of steel wheels on polished rails,

05:06.610 --> 05:08.840
your sour disposition will abate.

05:08.870 --> 05:09.970
Yeah, maybe.

05:10.010 --> 05:13.220
Meanwhil back in the 21st century,
people are raising their tray tables

05:13.260 --> 05:17.880
and putting their seat-backs in an upright
position 'cause it's time to land in San Francisco.

05:18.560 --> 05:20.130
It's not so bad, really.

05:20.180 --> 05:21.910
At least these trains
have modern plumbing.

05:21.950 --> 05:25.610
In India, you squat over a hole in the
train and expose your naked buttocks

05:25.620 --> 05:28.250
to the chilly air of Rajasthan.

05:28.260 --> 05:33.410
He is referring, of course, to third class on
Indian Railways' magnificent Ranakpur Express

05:33.460 --> 05:37.950
and its 1,200-kilometer journey from
Maharashtra to the Bikaner Junction.

05:37.960 --> 05:41.300
Oh, look, now he's boring
on an international scale.

05:42.850 --> 05:44.900
Holy crap! Look!

05:46.810 --> 05:48.310
Is that who I think it is?

05:48.340 --> 05:51.610
It can't be. What would Summer
Glau be doing riding the train?

05:51.620 --> 05:55.640
Maybe John Connor's aboard and she's
protecting him from an evil Terminator.

05:56.370 --> 05:59.340
Unlikely. That's a
television show, Leonard.

05:59.650 --> 06:01.300
Thank you.

06:01.310 --> 06:03.670
Of course, if SkyNet actually
did exist in the future,

06:03.710 --> 06:08.140
a perfect way to infiltrate and destroy
mankind would be to send Terminators back posing

06:08.150 --> 06:11.660
as actors who have played Terminators
in popular films and television series,

06:11.700 --> 06:14.290
lulling us into a false
sense of security, i.e.,

06:14.340 --> 06:16.700
"That's Summer Glau "from
The Sarah Connor Chronicles.

06:16.710 --> 06:20.800
No, Summer, don't kill
me!" I'm pro-robot! Ahh!"

06:22.770 --> 06:25.370
At least he's off the train crap.

06:26.860 --> 06:28.820
Whee!

06:30.030 --> 06:31.830
Sheldon, I owe you an apology.

06:31.870 --> 06:33.710
Taking the train was
a stroke of brilliance!

06:33.730 --> 06:35.900
I've actually got a
shot at a Terminator.

06:35.940 --> 06:37.910
Oh, please.When it comes to Terminators,

06:37.920 --> 06:41.320
you've got a better shot of
scoring with Arnold Schwarzenegger.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.300
You're overlooking something.

06:44.340 --> 06:48.760
I have 11 hours with
her in a confined space.

06:49.490 --> 06:53.570
Unless she's willing to jump off a moving
train, tuck and roll down the side of a hill,

06:53.610 --> 06:59.950
she will eventually succumb to the
acquired taste that is Howard Wolowitz.

07:02.730 --> 07:04.970
My money's on tuck and roll.

07:05.840 --> 07:06.960
I'm confused.

07:07.000 --> 07:11.150
I thought you were involved in some sort of
socially intimate pairing with Leslie Winkle.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.610
- Sheldon, let me explain to you how this works.
- All right.

07:15.620 --> 07:19.030
- That's Summer Glau.
- Yes.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.890
That's it.

07:21.570 --> 07:24.190
Hang on a sec. Why do you
get first crack at her?

07:24.200 --> 07:27.910
Um, well, let's see, couple
reasons. One, I saw her first.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.880
No, you didn't. I did.

07:29.890 --> 07:32.800
Fair enough. But... then,
let me move on to #2.

07:32.810 --> 07:36.440
Unlike you, I can actually
talk to women when I'm sober.

07:36.490 --> 07:40.920
You fail to take into account that
even mute, I am foreign and exotic,

07:40.980 --> 07:44.530
while you, on the other
hand, are frail and pasty.

07:45.890 --> 07:51.090
Well, you know the old saying,
Pasty and frail never fail.

07:53.830 --> 07:55.870
Excuse me, but what about me?

07:55.910 --> 07:57.510
Why don't I get a shot?

07:57.550 --> 08:00.630
Fine, go ahead. Take a shot.

08:02.280 --> 08:05.100
You know, I've already got a gorgeous
blonde back home at I can't score with.

08:05.150 --> 08:07.530
I think I'll let you two take this one.

08:07.540 --> 08:09.700
Sheldon, is there a place
on this train to get alcohol?

08:09.750 --> 08:11.240
Interesting that you ask.

08:11.290 --> 08:14.930
The Coast Starlight recently added
the refurbished Pacific Parlour Car.

08:14.980 --> 08:18.400
Built in 1956 and originally
known as the Santa Fe Lounge Car,

08:18.410 --> 08:20.530
- the lower level is a theater and
the upper level - Yeah-yeah, which way?

08:20.540 --> 08:24.070
is a bar that offers wine tastings
if you're going as far as Portland.

08:25.590 --> 08:27.200
So aren't you going to go talk to her?

08:27.240 --> 08:29.910
I will, I'm just working
on my opening line.

08:29.940 --> 08:32.070
She's probably heard every
possible line, Howard.

08:32.090 --> 08:33.530
Why don't you just try "hello"?

08:33.570 --> 08:36.179
No, no, no, that
always creeps girls out.

08:36.789 --> 08:41.630
I need to come up with something that's
funny, smart and delicately suggests

08:41.659 --> 08:45.800
that my sexual endowment is
disproportionate to my physical stature.

08:46.450 --> 08:49.020
You're going to need more than 11 hours.

08:49.840 --> 08:51.180
Oh, no.

08:51.220 --> 08:52.320
What's the matter?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.020
I forgot my flash drive.

08:54.060 --> 08:56.670
- So?
- So we have to go back.

08:56.680 --> 09:02.720
Okay, Sheldon, I'm going to say "why" and your
answer cannot be because I forgot my flash drive.

09:03.330 --> 09:04.470
You don't understand.

09:04.520 --> 09:09.220
My flash drive has my paper on astrophysical
probes of M-theory effects in the early universe

09:09.260 --> 09:11.910
that I was going to give to
George Smoot at the conference.

09:11.950 --> 09:15.170
Why do you have to give
your paper to George Smoot?

09:15.200 --> 09:18.170
It's brilliant. He needs to read it.

09:18.910 --> 09:21.020
So you'll send him an
e-mail when we get back.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.420
Then I won't get to see his
face light up as he reads it.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.420
Right. Of course.

09:25.430 --> 09:27.570
Oh, this is an unmitigated disaster.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.260
Well, there's nothing you
can do about it, so relax.

09:30.290 --> 09:35.500
Sit back, enjoy the clickety-clack of
the steel wheels on the polished rails.

09:39.330 --> 09:44.580
You forgot your flash drive

09:44.590 --> 09:46.810
You forgot your flash drive

09:46.820 --> 09:50.060
Only ten hours, 55 minutes to go.

09:52.000 --> 09:58.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:59.920 --> 10:02.520
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

10:15.060 --> 10:17.780
So... where you gals headed?

10:18.480 --> 10:20.660
Okay, I've found the perfect solution.

10:20.690 --> 10:23.070
We get off the train at
the next stop in Oxnard.

10:23.100 --> 10:26.420
We then take the 1:13
train back to Union Station.

10:26.470 --> 10:31.230
We take a cab back to the apartment, get my
flash drive, and then race to San Luis Obispo,

10:31.290 --> 10:34.730
where, assuming the lights are with us
and minimal traffic, we'll meet the train.

10:34.740 --> 10:36.020
I've got a better idea.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.410
Are you going to be sarcastic?

10:38.420 --> 10:41.380
Boy, you take all the
fun out of it for me.

10:41.690 --> 10:44.600
Look, Penny's home. Why don't we just
call her, have her go in the apartment,

10:44.610 --> 10:46.750
get your flash drive
and e-mail you the paper?

10:46.790 --> 10:50.020
- But the flash drive is in a locked drawer in my desk.
- So?

10:50.030 --> 10:52.210
- The key is hidden in my room.
- So?

10:52.220 --> 10:54.140
- Penny would have to go into my room.
- So?

10:54.150 --> 10:57.040
People don't go in my room!

10:57.320 --> 11:02.590
I see. Well, it seems once again, you're
caught between a rock and a crazy place.

11:04.520 --> 11:07.450
Oh, I te when that happens.

11:08.340 --> 11:10.240
It's hot in here. It must be Summer.

11:10.250 --> 11:11.660
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.720
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

11:13.730 --> 11:16.910
It's hot in here. Must be Summer.

11:17.830 --> 11:21.310
- That's cute.
- Really? I just made it up.

11:22.080 --> 11:24.590
Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire?

11:25.350 --> 11:26.830
Oh, yeah, I loved it.

11:26.850 --> 11:29.310
It's loosely based on my life.

11:32.270 --> 11:36.520
Yeah, we're putting the play on for one night
in this little 99-seat theater. Can you come?

11:36.530 --> 11:37.870
Oh, great.

11:37.910 --> 11:40.890
Do you know 98 other people
that might want to come?

11:41.380 --> 11:42.630
Oh, hang on.

11:42.920 --> 11:44.480
- Hello?
- Listen carefully.

11:44.490 --> 11:48.270
I'm about to give you a set of instructions,
which you must follow to the letter.

11:48.300 --> 11:49.810
Just a sec.

11:49.860 --> 11:52.420
The theater is above a bowling
alley, so it's a little noisy,

11:52.470 --> 11:56.230
but it might be the only chance
I'll ever get to play Anne Frank.

11:57.260 --> 11:58.780
And the director is brilliant.

11:58.830 --> 12:02.230
He uses the bowling sounds
as, like, Nazi artillery.

12:02.540 --> 12:05.100
Okay, great, I'll see you then. Hello?

12:05.110 --> 12:07.690
Okay, step four.

12:08.060 --> 12:11.550
Do you see that small
plastic case on my dresser?

12:11.580 --> 12:13.690
Your dresser? Who is this?

12:13.700 --> 12:14.760
It's Sheldon.

12:14.790 --> 12:17.800
Oh, hey, Sheldon! How is San Francisco?

12:17.810 --> 12:21.570
I'm not in San Francisco. I'm on a
train. Were you even listening to me?

12:21.580 --> 12:23.950
Uh, no, I was talking to
my friend, but what's up?

12:23.980 --> 12:25.860
What's up? I'll tell you what's up.

12:25.870 --> 12:29.890
I'm in a crisis situation, and I need you
to marshal your powers of concentration,

12:29.930 --> 12:32.770
- limited as they may be...
- Give me the phone.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.910
Hi, Penny. It's Leonard.

12:35.920 --> 12:39.090
Hey, Leonard. What's
going on with Dr. Wkadood?

12:40.090 --> 12:41.930
He's calling to ask you a favor.

12:41.970 --> 12:46.790
You might be confused because he didn't use the
words, Penny, "Sheldon," "please" or "favor."

12:46.800 --> 12:49.720
Okay. Enough chitchat.

12:49.730 --> 12:53.220
Okay, step one. Locate your
emergency key to our apartment.

12:53.230 --> 12:58.610
Step two: enter our
apartment. Step three:...

12:58.620 --> 13:01.490
Enter my broom.

13:01.520 --> 13:04.610
- Oh, hang on, Sheldon, getting another call.
- No!

13:05.040 --> 13:09.210
Leonard, let me tell you something.
Personal robots cannot get here soon enough.

13:11.820 --> 13:15.780
And that bright little star
peeking her head out early today...

13:15.820 --> 13:17.940
that's Venus.

13:17.970 --> 13:20.050
That is so cool.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.840
You really know a lot about space.

13:21.880 --> 13:27.600
Come on. When you were on TV in
Firefly, you were actually in space.

13:28.460 --> 13:31.160
You're not one of those guys
who really believe that, are you?

13:31.200 --> 13:34.520
You mean one of the hopeless geeks? No.

13:34.530 --> 13:37.250
Those are crazy people.

13:39.030 --> 13:42.890
Howard, be a dear and get
me another one of these.

13:47.660 --> 13:50.640
Now, him, he's one of those geeks.

13:51.940 --> 13:54.630
All right, now, before you
enter my bedroom unescorted,

13:54.680 --> 14:00.740
I need you to understand that this onetime grant
of access does not create a permanent easement.

14:01.610 --> 14:04.360
Easement.

14:04.400 --> 14:08.140
It's a legal right
of access. Good grief.

14:09.450 --> 14:12.480
What? No, don't put me on hold.

14:14.690 --> 14:16.330
Do you believe him?

14:16.370 --> 14:20.660
Normally around women, he has the
personality of a boiled potato.

14:20.670 --> 14:24.920
Put one beer in him, and
he's M. Night Charmalarmalon.

14:27.850 --> 14:30.160
Is that what he's drinking?
It's not even real beer.

14:30.170 --> 14:34.210
- What? - Look at it.
Non-alcoholic beer.

14:35.940 --> 14:38.050
- What's going on?
- I don't know.

14:38.060 --> 14:41.230
Some sort of placebo effect, I guess.

14:41.240 --> 14:45.600
Placebo, you say. Interesting.

14:45.610 --> 14:48.500
Yes, I'm still here. Where
am I going? I'm on a train.

14:48.510 --> 14:54.250
Now, what you'll be looking for is a small
wooden box located between a Hoberman's sphere

14:54.290 --> 14:57.680
and a sample of quartz
flecked with pyrite.

14:57.710 --> 14:59.460
Hoberman's Sphere.

14:59.500 --> 15:02.580
It's collapsible icosidodecahedron.

15:03.610 --> 15:07.290
No, the thing with the time
on it is my alarm clock.

15:09.690 --> 15:13.200
Actually, in India, the names
of constellations are different.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.710
Where you have the Big Dipper,
we have the Big Curry Pot.

15:18.600 --> 15:20.390
You're making that up.

15:20.410 --> 15:22.250
You got me.

15:22.290 --> 15:24.780
Now what are you going to do with me?

15:28.750 --> 15:30.060
- Raj.
- Yes?

15:30.070 --> 15:31.970
- Look.
- What am I looking at?

15:31.980 --> 15:33.500
You tell me.

15:33.530 --> 15:36.140
Non-alcoholic beer.

15:44.360 --> 15:47.690
I'm the small package
good things come in.

15:50.660 --> 15:53.330
Okay, I got a box, but
there's no key in here.

15:53.370 --> 15:54.350
Just letters.

15:54.380 --> 15:56.180
That's the wrg box. Put it back.

15:56.190 --> 15:58.950
Oh, Sheldon, are these
letters from your grandmother?

15:58.990 --> 16:00.630
Don't read those letters!

16:00.670 --> 16:03.900
Oh, look, she calls you
"Moon Pie." That is so cute.

16:03.910 --> 16:06.510
Put down the letters!

16:09.210 --> 16:10.730
Hey, Penny. It's Leonard.

16:10.740 --> 16:12.390
Hey, Leonard. How's the train ride?

16:12.400 --> 16:14.860
Delightful.

16:14.870 --> 16:16.300
Listen, I don't know what
you're doing right now,

16:16.350 --> 16:19.730
but there are little bubbles forming
on the corners of Sheldon's mouth.

16:19.740 --> 16:22.540
Okay, yeah, I kind of crossed
a line. Put him back on.

16:22.550 --> 16:24.360
Thank you.

16:25.280 --> 16:27.860
- I'm back.
- What up, Moon Pie?

16:28.740 --> 16:31.960
Nobody calls me Moon Pie but Meemaw!

16:33.760 --> 16:36.170
Hey, Penny. Leonard again.

16:37.640 --> 16:41.370
So anyway, in the dream, you and I
were ice skating, just the two of us.

16:41.410 --> 16:45.760
And then, I picked you up by your
ankles and twirled you round and round

16:45.770 --> 16:48.650
until your legs tore off.

16:50.190 --> 16:53.890
I tried to stick them back
on, but before I could,

16:53.920 --> 16:58.350
you turned into a giant
loaf of pumpernickel bread.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.560
What do you think that means?

17:01.570 --> 17:04.400
I really don't know.

17:05.270 --> 17:07.540
I'll give you a little
clue. My favorite sandwich?

17:07.550 --> 17:10.240
Salami on pumpernickel.

17:10.970 --> 17:13.250
Is that so?

17:13.260 --> 17:16.869
And did you know the word "pumpernickel" comes
from the German words "pumper" and "nickel,"

17:16.900 --> 17:19.550
which loosely translates
to "fart goblin"?

17:21.310 --> 17:24.369
No. I didn't.

17:27.130 --> 17:29.090
Okay, I found the box. Now what?

17:29.100 --> 17:34.910
You're holding a Japanese puzzle box,
which takes ten precise moves to open.

17:34.950 --> 17:38.190
First, locate the panel
with the diamond pattern

17:38.200 --> 17:42.190
and slide the center portion
one millimeter to the left.

17:42.210 --> 17:47.620
Then, on the opposite end of the box,
slide the entire panel down two millimeters.

17:47.660 --> 17:49.960
- You'll hear a slight click.
- Hang on.

17:49.970 --> 17:53.380
Sheldon, do you have any
emotional attachment to this box?

17:53.420 --> 17:57.030
No, it's a velty I ordered off the
Internet. Did you hear the click?

17:57.040 --> 17:59.630
Not yet.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.390
There it is.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.920
Okay, here's another one.

18:08.950 --> 18:14.880
If you married the famous rock guitarist
Johnny Winter, you'd be Summer Winter.

18:17.710 --> 18:19.530
Yep.

18:19.540 --> 18:23.830
Okay, I'm going to just go for
broke here and say I like you.

18:24.470 --> 18:26.190
Yeah?

18:26.650 --> 18:30.850
So here's my question: do you
realistically see any conversational path

18:30.890 --> 18:33.000
that would take me from where
we are right now to a place

18:33.030 --> 18:35.700
where I could ask you
out and you'd say yes?

18:37.170 --> 18:39.000
No.

18:40.470 --> 18:42.960
Fair enough. I'll leave you in peace.

18:42.970 --> 18:44.980
Thank you.

18:47.050 --> 18:50.040
But before I go,

18:50.060 --> 18:54.820
would you mind if I just take one picture
of us together for my Facebook page?

18:54.830 --> 18:56.450
Sure.

19:05.250 --> 19:09.460
Okay. Great. Now, can I take one
where it looks like we're making out?

19:11.120 --> 19:17.320
Okay, now you're going to insert
the flash drive into the USB port...

19:20.710 --> 19:26.030
She calls me Moon Pie because I'm
nummy-nummy and she could just eat me up.

19:27.600 --> 19:32.010
Now, please put the flash
drive in the USB port.

19:33.890 --> 19:37.210
The one that looks like
a little duck's mouth.

19:38.990 --> 19:40.260
Hey, how'd it go?

19:40.290 --> 19:43.160
Terminator broke my phone.

19:48.280 --> 19:50.270
Excuse me.

19:51.530 --> 19:52.940
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

19:52.970 --> 19:56.410
I've just spent the last two hours
imagining various scenarios in my head,

19:56.440 --> 19:58.810
trying to come up with some
clever line to say to you.

19:58.850 --> 20:02.680
But then I finally realized you're
a human being; I'm a human being.

20:02.700 --> 20:04.920
- I could just say to you...
- Next stop: Santa Barbara.

20:04.930 --> 20:07.120
I'm sorry. This is me.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.700
Hi, my name's Leonard.

20:14.860 --> 20:18.330
So, I'm thinking, you won the
Nobel Prize what, three years ago?

20:18.360 --> 20:22.040
So you must deal with a whole lot
of "What has Smoot done lately?"

20:23.120 --> 20:26.520
My thought is we continue
my research as aeam--

20:26.560 --> 20:28.760
you know, Cooper-Smoot,
alphabetical--

20:28.770 --> 20:33.400
and when we win the Nobel
Prize, you'll be back on top.

20:33.710 --> 20:37.190
With all due respect, Dr.
Cooper, are you on crack?

20:40.520 --> 20:42.960
Fine! Smoot-Cooper.

20:42.970 --> 20:45.660
Wow, what a diva.
