00:00.554 --> 00:01.987
Previously on "Heartland"...

00:02.021 --> 00:03.656
Casey does make me happy.

00:03.691 --> 00:06.659
You're falling in love with her...

00:06.694 --> 00:09.199
And that terrifies you.

00:11.331 --> 00:13.866
I'll see you around.

00:13.900 --> 00:15.868
I'd like you to promise me

00:15.902 --> 00:18.603
you'll fight for what's important.

00:18.638 --> 00:20.539
Sounds like you're doing really great.

00:20.573 --> 00:23.142
I am.

00:23.176 --> 00:24.976
It was really nice to see you.

00:36.823 --> 00:38.990
Well, honey,
I gotta thank you for helping out.

00:39.024 --> 00:41.092
With Jack and Lisa on... what?

00:41.126 --> 00:43.194
They're 18th honeymoon...

00:43.229 --> 00:44.929
I kinda miss the old guy out here.

00:44.964 --> 00:47.465
God knows I'm lonely enough.

00:47.499 --> 00:48.900
So are things really
over with you and Casey?

00:50.236 --> 00:53.471
I don't know.

00:53.505 --> 00:56.640
Maybe she just needs time
to think things over.

00:56.675 --> 00:58.542
There seems to be a lot
of that going around lately.

00:58.577 --> 00:59.910
Well, it's different for me, Amy.

00:59.944 --> 01:02.112
I got a history.

01:02.146 --> 01:04.266
You've had... what? Two serious boyfriends?

01:04.316 --> 01:05.950
Yeah. Jesse for about five minutes,

01:05.984 --> 01:08.386
and Ty, for five years.

01:08.420 --> 01:09.853
Well, Caleb, he was in the mix too...

01:09.888 --> 01:13.924
No. No, let's not go there.

01:13.959 --> 01:17.427
Amy, my point is that you
just don't want to go down

01:17.462 --> 01:19.529
the same road that I have.

01:19.564 --> 01:22.399
Always missing somebody.

01:22.433 --> 01:25.035
So you miss Casey.

01:25.070 --> 01:27.170
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

01:27.205 --> 01:30.039
Then what're you doing, dad?

01:30.074 --> 01:33.176
You were the one who told me
to fight for what you want.

01:39.956 --> 01:43.220
And this is my great-great-
grandfather, Jefferson Bartlett,

01:43.254 --> 01:46.155
and my great-grandfather, Jack Bartlett,

01:46.189 --> 01:49.425
and his wife, Lyndy,
who was my great-grandmother,

01:49.459 --> 01:52.528
and their daughter, Marion,
who was my grandmother.

01:52.562 --> 01:56.465
My grandfather, Tim Fleming,
and their daughter, Amy.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.534
And these are my birth parents,

01:58.568 --> 02:02.471
Matthew and Mary Crawley,
and my brother, Jeff.

02:02.506 --> 02:06.142
And... this is my mother,
Lou, and my father, Peter,

02:06.176 --> 02:09.777
and my little sister Katie, and there's me!

02:12.382 --> 02:14.883
That's great! Great job, honey.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.318
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that was wonderful.

02:16.353 --> 02:18.554
Yeah.
Real-really wonderful, honey!

02:18.588 --> 02:21.222
Right?

02:21.257 --> 02:23.258
It's a kid's family tree project, okay?

02:23.292 --> 02:24.926
It's not a master's thesis in genealogy,
Lou...

02:24.961 --> 02:26.995
No, honey. But listen.

02:27.030 --> 02:29.131
There was Morrises, Flemmings, Bartletts,

02:29.165 --> 02:30.465
but besides her parents and her brother,

02:30.499 --> 02:32.534
not even a single Crawley.

02:32.568 --> 02:34.335
And nothing at all from her
mother's side of the family.

02:34.370 --> 02:36.837
I mean,
it's like she doesn't even have a past.

02:36.872 --> 02:38.573
- Let it go.
- I can't!

02:38.607 --> 02:40.308
Because this is the
perfect opportunity for her

02:40.342 --> 02:42.210
to connect with her birth family!

02:42.244 --> 02:44.078
It's not, no.
It's not the perfect opportunity.

02:44.112 --> 02:46.013
The perfect opportunity is when she says

02:46.048 --> 02:47.114
she wants to connect with her birth family,
Lou.

02:47.149 --> 02:49.016
Come on, honey. We have the paperwork.

02:49.051 --> 02:50.985
We have the contact information.

02:51.019 --> 02:53.487
We can... doesn't she have a right to know?

02:53.521 --> 02:55.656
Know what?

03:00.128 --> 03:02.163
All right, Caleb,
show Casey what he's got.

03:11.839 --> 03:14.641
Hi-yah! Hi-yah! Come on!

03:14.676 --> 03:16.009
Whoa!

03:24.752 --> 03:27.821
Caleb, you all right?

03:27.855 --> 03:31.091
Yeah, I'm okay.

03:31.125 --> 03:33.359
I mean that wasn't perfect, but...

03:33.393 --> 03:35.528
When we get the kinks worked out,
what do you think?

03:35.562 --> 03:39.398
Well, he does know how to run.
Pretty solidly built too.

03:39.433 --> 03:41.367
Yeah,
that's what we were thinking, hey Ty?

03:41.401 --> 03:42.935
Steady in the gate, he's got a good eye.

03:42.969 --> 03:45.271
Yeah, sure does.

03:45.305 --> 03:46.805
Yeah, problem is, he's okay on the run,

03:46.840 --> 03:49.242
but he turns away way too soon.

03:49.276 --> 03:50.610
You know, for bulldogging, you need a horse

03:50.644 --> 03:51.910
that's gonna give you an
honest run every time.

03:51.945 --> 03:55.114
Yeah, we can definitely work on that.

03:55.148 --> 03:57.750
Uh, yeah. Well, hey, Casey,
thanks for coming to see him.

03:57.784 --> 04:00.018
Um, I have to go.

04:00.053 --> 04:01.653
Let me know if you guys work something out?

04:04.705 --> 04:06.691
Your partner's got something
better to do than sell me a horse?

04:06.726 --> 04:08.961
Yeah, he's uh-he's got a job.

04:08.995 --> 04:10.195
But no worries though, he's, more or less,

04:10.230 --> 04:13.265
the silent part of the equation.

04:13.299 --> 04:15.199
So what do you think?
Can we make something happen?

04:15.234 --> 04:18.136
I don't think so. Not today.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.305
But you teach him how to
run in a straight line,

04:20.339 --> 04:22.407
stick to that steer till you get off him,

04:22.441 --> 04:24.242
be happy to take another look.

04:24.277 --> 04:26.978
All right! Okay. It's no problem.

04:27.012 --> 04:28.413
I'll get right on it.

04:33.085 --> 04:36.353
Hey, Amy, it's Caleb. Just curious...

04:36.388 --> 04:38.618
Do you know anything about
training a bulldogging horse?

04:39.735 --> 04:43.660
S08E08
The Family Tree

04:43.861 --> 04:48.220
sync and corrected by ninh
www.addic7ed.com

05:20.497 --> 05:22.264
I still don't
see what's wrong with it.

05:22.299 --> 05:23.700
There is nothing wrong with it,

05:23.734 --> 05:26.602
what you have done is very, very good.

05:26.637 --> 05:28.304
But we thought this might
be a good opportunity

05:28.339 --> 05:30.206
to add some of your birth family?

05:30.240 --> 05:31.907
But I don't even know anyone,

05:31.942 --> 05:34.377
except for my mom and dad and Jeffie.

05:34.411 --> 05:36.579
Well, all the more reason to get
to know some of your relatives.

05:36.613 --> 05:40.316
For example, your aunt Crystal.

05:40.350 --> 05:43.152
- Who?
- She was your mother's younger sister,

05:43.186 --> 05:46.355
and I have her contact information...

05:46.389 --> 05:48.623
right here, on the adoption papers.

05:48.658 --> 05:50.592
Never heard of her.

05:50.626 --> 05:52.427
All the more reason to get to know her.

05:52.462 --> 05:54.429
Look, we could write her an e-mail

05:54.464 --> 05:56.865
and ask her if she knows
anything about your grandparents.

05:56.899 --> 06:01.536
I bet you she could tell you
tons about your mom and dad.

06:02.156 --> 06:04.639
What do you think?

06:14.716 --> 06:17.085
Hey! Case.

06:17.119 --> 06:18.686
Hey, Tim.

06:21.177 --> 06:23.258
So...?

06:23.292 --> 06:25.526
How you been?

06:25.560 --> 06:26.994
I've been good, I've been busy.

06:27.028 --> 06:28.496
Horse business.

06:28.530 --> 06:31.365
Yup, same here.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.967
Yeah... Case,
I think I gave you the wrong impression.

06:34.002 --> 06:35.569
You know, I-I didn't wanna push you away.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.406
I was never moving on.
I loved our road trip.

06:38.440 --> 06:40.007
Well, we'll always have Brooks.

06:40.041 --> 06:42.276
Yeah, or Carstairs? Or Alder Flats?

06:42.310 --> 06:45.078
See? I love that. I miss that.

06:45.113 --> 06:47.347
I... I think I just...

06:47.382 --> 06:48.982
I think I made a mistake calling it off.

06:49.017 --> 06:50.784
I called it off.

06:57.725 --> 07:00.593
Okay. I'm asking you to reconsider.

07:00.628 --> 07:02.228
I don't know, Tim. We're both pretty busy.

07:02.262 --> 07:03.630
I'll see you around.

07:03.664 --> 07:07.333
Aw-

07:07.367 --> 07:09.602
Come on, don't be like that!

07:09.637 --> 07:11.137
Just give me a second chance, that's...

07:11.171 --> 07:12.605
I'll get it right this time, I promise.

07:12.640 --> 07:14.206
- Get what right?
- Us.

07:14.241 --> 07:17.243
I'll get us right. I miss you.

07:17.277 --> 07:19.812
You miss me.

07:22.249 --> 07:23.649
Okay, you don't miss me, but...

07:23.683 --> 07:26.185
I miss you enough for both of us.

07:28.655 --> 07:31.723
Okay... I guess.

07:31.758 --> 07:34.860
"Okay, I guess."

07:34.894 --> 07:37.529
That's all you got?

07:37.564 --> 07:40.666
Yeah. That's all I got.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.835
Now get outta here before I change my mind.

07:42.869 --> 07:45.471
Okay, all right!

07:47.574 --> 07:49.307
It's gonna be- it's gonna be great!

07:49.342 --> 07:51.843
When should I call you?

07:51.877 --> 07:55.880
Okay, let's go in here. There we go.

07:55.914 --> 07:58.516
Get some water...

07:58.550 --> 08:01.019
Where's Scott? His truck's gone.

08:01.053 --> 08:03.554
He couldn't wait for you, Ty.
But he told me to yell at you for him.

08:03.589 --> 08:05.290
I was just meeting a client with Caleb.

08:05.324 --> 08:08.493
You know... I really don't get it.

08:08.527 --> 08:10.160
Scott gives you all this
extra responsibility...

08:10.195 --> 08:12.262
I mean, he let's you do surgery.

08:12.297 --> 08:14.164
If it were me,
I'd be stepping up to the plate, Ty.

08:14.199 --> 08:16.266
I just need one more sale,

08:16.301 --> 08:18.870
so I don't leave Caleb in the lurch...
money-wise.

08:18.904 --> 08:20.471
Meanwhile, you're letting things slide,

08:20.506 --> 08:22.339
your work at the clinic sucks,

08:22.374 --> 08:24.541
and I heard your marks are slipping.

08:24.575 --> 08:27.777
Cass, you know how hard it is to
fast track through vet school.

08:27.812 --> 08:30.947
Yeah, I know.
You better watch your back.

08:30.982 --> 08:32.682
Pretty soon you'll be the
one cleaning the cages

08:32.717 --> 08:34.485
and I'll be going on client calls.

08:34.519 --> 08:36.653
One more sale.

08:40.658 --> 08:43.292
Hey! That was fast!

08:43.327 --> 08:45.595
- What was fast?
- Your aunt Crystal just got back to me.

08:45.630 --> 08:47.831
Oh, great. What'd she say?

08:47.865 --> 08:50.934
Um...
"I would be happy to fill in the gaps

08:50.968 --> 08:53.169
in Georgina's family tree.

08:53.203 --> 08:54.871
My schedule is clear the next few days

08:54.906 --> 08:58.041
and I would love to come for a visit..."

08:58.075 --> 09:00.543
A visit? Here?

09:00.577 --> 09:03.146
"...and get reacquainted
with my favourite niece."

09:03.180 --> 09:05.248
Let me see!

09:08.185 --> 09:11.020
Look, it says she has
pictures of my mom when she was a kid!

09:11.055 --> 09:13.422
And Jeff and I, and my dad.

09:13.456 --> 09:15.858
She's got a whole family album!

09:15.892 --> 09:18.561
Cool.

09:24.901 --> 09:29.031
Hey, Caleb. So... how'd it go with Casey?

09:29.472 --> 09:31.339
Okay.
But she was a little weirded out

09:31.374 --> 09:33.675
by the way you just took off.

09:33.709 --> 09:35.410
Come on, man,
we're supposed to be partners.

09:35.445 --> 09:37.479
Well, I was supposed to meet Scott.

09:37.513 --> 09:39.281
So what, no sale?

09:41.284 --> 09:43.518
Hey, Amy.

09:43.553 --> 09:45.319
Didn't know that you were here.

09:45.353 --> 09:47.388
Yeah.
I just... wanted to take a look at Rusty,

09:47.422 --> 09:48.856
see what we're dealing with.

09:48.891 --> 09:51.225
- Huh.
- Look, Casey's interested,

09:51.259 --> 09:53.761
but only if we can get him to
run the pattern he supposed to.

09:53.796 --> 09:57.465
So I... asked Amy to give us a hand.

09:57.499 --> 10:00.635
So, uh... So what do you think?

10:00.669 --> 10:02.736
He's put together like a bulldogging horse,

10:02.770 --> 10:05.038
but this isn't really my specialty.

10:05.073 --> 10:07.641
Don't worry, brother,
we'll get her done.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.676
Well, that's good to know.

10:09.711 --> 10:11.612
I'm sure that you and Amy uh...

10:11.646 --> 10:14.315
Well, I mean, you can figure it out.

10:14.349 --> 10:17.384
I uh... I should probably get going, so...

10:17.419 --> 10:20.954
See you later.

10:20.989 --> 10:22.589
I don't know what to tell you.

10:22.624 --> 10:26.126
Lately, you get five minutes of his time...

10:26.160 --> 10:27.928
Consider yourself lucky.

10:33.701 --> 10:36.402
So it looks like Casey
and I are back on track,

10:36.437 --> 10:37.770
and I am not gonna screw it up this time.

10:37.804 --> 10:39.905
I am not gonna push her away.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.609
That's great, dad. I really like Casey.

10:42.643 --> 10:44.710
Did she tell you she's thinking
of buying a bulldogging horse?

10:44.745 --> 10:46.045
Caleb wants me to help him out.

10:46.079 --> 10:49.182
What? Are you kidding me?

10:51.184 --> 10:53.760
Oh, there's only one reason
that she would buy that.

10:55.355 --> 10:56.822
She's gonna give it to me!

10:56.857 --> 11:01.043
And why would
she give you a horse?

11:01.063 --> 11:04.664
She may have gotten the idea that
I wanted to get back into rodeo.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.732
And how would she get that idea?

11:06.767 --> 11:09.067
On the road, I might've said something...

11:09.101 --> 11:11.537
about doing some bulldogging
on the senior's circuit?

11:11.571 --> 11:13.305
Are you kidding me?

11:13.339 --> 11:16.208
Oh man... and she's gonna
want me to jump off that horse

11:16.242 --> 11:19.478
and wrestle a five hundred pound steer,
or die trying.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.247
No. Nobody is making you jump off a horse.

11:22.282 --> 11:24.515
Let me explain something to you, Amy.

11:24.550 --> 11:26.384
I've had more than my
fair share of glory days,

11:26.418 --> 11:27.786
but they've come at a price,

11:27.820 --> 11:30.021
and that price is that
there's always somebody

11:30.056 --> 11:32.490
that wants to see me take
one last kick at the can,

11:32.524 --> 11:34.125
and I can't risk that.

11:34.160 --> 11:36.294
Okay. Okay.

11:36.328 --> 11:38.496
So... do you have any pointers for me?

11:38.530 --> 11:40.898
Pointers?

11:40.932 --> 11:43.367
Well, more than likely,
Caleb's your problem.

11:43.402 --> 11:48.806
And if it's not Caleb, then what do I do?

11:48.840 --> 11:50.541
So, first off, my dad says

11:50.576 --> 11:52.443
if Rusty's pulling away
from the steer too early,

11:52.477 --> 11:54.545
it's 'cause he's anticipating the dismount.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.847
He's too used to you,
so I figure we switch it up.

11:56.881 --> 11:58.348
I'll ride Rusty, and you can Haze.

11:58.382 --> 12:00.184
What, you're a bulldogger now?

12:00.218 --> 12:02.186
No! There is no way that
I'm gonna be taking down a steer,

12:02.220 --> 12:03.553
but I figure we'll just tie
a ribbon to the steer's back

12:03.588 --> 12:05.122
and I can grab it off.

12:05.156 --> 12:06.724
You're kidding me. That's for little girls.

12:06.758 --> 12:09.093
Shut up, Caleb. Do you wanna do it?

12:09.127 --> 12:11.061
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

12:19.770 --> 12:22.972
- Well... it's a start.
- Mm-hmm.

12:23.006 --> 12:26.209
- What do we do now?
- We keep trying.

12:26.244 --> 12:28.177
Come on, Caleb, we got this.

12:28.212 --> 12:29.045
Yeah. One of these days.

12:42.826 --> 12:44.593
Georgina!

12:46.363 --> 12:50.909
Oh... my God! You're all grown up!

12:52.802 --> 12:56.639
Wow! I just cannot believe it!

12:56.673 --> 12:58.741
Let me get a look at you.

12:58.775 --> 13:01.443
Come here.

13:01.478 --> 13:04.079
You are definitely your mother's daughter.

13:04.113 --> 13:06.514
Look, you've got her same beautiful eyes,

13:06.548 --> 13:08.416
and your smile...

13:08.450 --> 13:11.697
Wow! It's just so great to see you!

13:14.423 --> 13:18.693
Hi! You must be the lucky
couple that adopted Georgina.

13:18.727 --> 13:20.828
- Yeah, hi. I'm Peter.
- Hi. Crystal.

13:20.862 --> 13:22.196
- This is my wife, Lou.
- Oh, hi.

13:22.230 --> 13:24.265
This is our youngest, Katie.

13:24.300 --> 13:28.969
Hi. Well,
it is just so great to meet you all.

13:29.004 --> 13:31.706
I'm so happy that you invited
me here to see my niece,

13:31.740 --> 13:34.175
finally, after all these years.

13:36.311 --> 13:38.254
Would you show me around, hmm?

13:41.826 --> 13:46.330
I was no near ready to look after
Georgina and Jeffie when my sister...

13:47.765 --> 13:49.965
You know, when the accident happened.

13:50.000 --> 13:51.901
It would've been really
awesome to watch them grow up,

13:51.935 --> 13:55.767
but I...
I was a kid myself and I was in love.

13:55.872 --> 13:58.774
I followed this guy halfway
around the world and then...

13:58.809 --> 14:00.109
You know, when that didn't work out, I...

14:00.143 --> 14:02.211
I just kept going.

14:02.245 --> 14:04.113
And you-you still travel a lot?

14:04.147 --> 14:06.849
Yeah, all the time.
I'm a travel industry consultant.

14:06.883 --> 14:08.517
- Really?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:08.551 --> 14:10.953
I specialize in high end
resorts all around the world.

14:10.988 --> 14:13.822
You know, fine tuning the relationship
between staff and guests and...

14:13.856 --> 14:15.591
Just helping them be the best they can be.

14:15.625 --> 14:17.092
You know, keep the magic happening.

14:17.127 --> 14:18.793
Wow.

14:18.828 --> 14:20.496
Hey! I'm gonna have to eat and run.

14:20.530 --> 14:22.097
I'm working down at the rodeo grounds.

14:22.132 --> 14:23.265
Well, I'm glad you took a break.

14:23.299 --> 14:25.601
Um, Crystal, this is my sister Amy.

14:25.635 --> 14:27.536
She's the cowgirl of the family.

14:27.570 --> 14:29.004
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Hi. You too.

14:29.038 --> 14:31.239
Crystal was just telling us about her job.

14:31.273 --> 14:33.174
She's a travel consultant!

14:33.208 --> 14:35.110
- Well, that sounds fun.
- Mm-hmm, yeah, it's a great job.

14:35.144 --> 14:38.446
Actually,
you know my next stop is Siena, Italy,

14:38.480 --> 14:40.715
where they've been having this amazing
horse race since the sixteen hundreds.

14:40.750 --> 14:43.652
Yeah! The Palio di Siena.
I would love to go to that.

14:43.686 --> 14:46.454
- Oh, me too!
- Well, then let's do it!

14:46.488 --> 14:48.289
- Okay!
- Okay!

14:48.323 --> 14:51.372
- It was nice to meet you, Crystal.
- Yeah, you too.

14:51.392 --> 14:53.561
You know, Crystal, Lou here
is also in the hospitality industry.

14:53.595 --> 14:55.696
- Oh...
- Yeah... Now...

14:55.730 --> 14:57.831
Owner and operator of
the best diner in town,

14:57.866 --> 14:59.567
as well as a sweet little dude ranch.

14:59.601 --> 15:01.636
The Heartland Equestrian Connection.

15:01.670 --> 15:02.836
I know, I checked out your website.

15:02.871 --> 15:04.972
It looks fabulous. And I would think,

15:05.006 --> 15:06.540
in a location like this,
it must be doing really well.

15:06.574 --> 15:08.042
Oh, yeah, we do okay,

15:08.076 --> 15:10.811
but you know,
it's- it's not a huge business.

15:10.845 --> 15:15.315
Oh. It-it could be.
I mean, we should talk, Lou.

15:15.349 --> 15:17.751
It's a little bit more of a mom and
pop operation than my usual clients,

15:17.786 --> 15:19.252
but, um, I think I could help you make

15:19.287 --> 15:20.920
some really great connections.

15:20.954 --> 15:24.591
Oh, really? That would... be great.

15:24.625 --> 15:27.227
And Peter, what do you do?
You don't look like a rancher.

15:27.261 --> 15:29.596
No. Me, no. Just...

15:29.630 --> 15:32.465
another guy working in the oil industry.

15:32.500 --> 15:36.736
Ha! Yeah, well, now we're talking
about real jobs, right, Lou?

15:36.770 --> 15:39.172
Well, um, you had said in your e-mail

15:39.206 --> 15:41.207
that you could help Georgie
with her family tree project.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.409
I can. That's why I'm here.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.111
Well, I mean, also to get reacquainted

15:45.145 --> 15:47.479
with my lovely little niece.

15:47.514 --> 15:49.582
Well, you know,
we understand that you're a very busy lady

15:49.616 --> 15:51.951
and you only have a little time...

15:51.985 --> 15:55.020
Actually... I checked out the
availability of your dude ranch online

15:55.054 --> 15:56.689
and I saw that there was a cabin free.

15:56.723 --> 15:59.525
So I was thinking, how great would it be

15:59.559 --> 16:00.792
if I just stuck around for a couple of days

16:00.827 --> 16:03.729
so Georgie and I could catch up, huh?

16:03.763 --> 16:06.365
Yeah! That sounds- that sounds perfect.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.567
- Okay.
- So, Peter, why don't you...

16:08.602 --> 16:09.567
take Crystal down to the dude ranch

16:09.602 --> 16:11.502
and help her get settled in?

16:11.537 --> 16:13.105
- Oh, can I come too?
- Uh, later.

16:13.139 --> 16:14.840
I need you to help me clean up first, okay?

16:14.874 --> 16:17.442
- Oh, please, Lou! Come on!
- Please, Lou, come on.

16:17.476 --> 16:19.111
Okay... Sure.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.578
Just help me clear the table.

16:20.613 --> 16:23.915
Okay.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.584
She doesn't call you mom and dad?

16:26.619 --> 16:29.320
Uh... no, you know, sometimes.

16:29.355 --> 16:30.388
Usually it's just Peter and Lou.

16:30.422 --> 16:31.756
Ah... huh.

16:38.497 --> 16:41.733
Hi-yah! Hi-yah!

16:45.737 --> 16:49.974
Hustle!
Hustle!

16:53.912 --> 16:55.880
Yeah!

16:58.349 --> 17:01.117
Yeah, get him! Come on!

17:12.430 --> 17:13.730
Ready?

17:16.800 --> 17:18.733
This is it.

17:26.042 --> 17:28.077
Get him! Get him! Come on!

17:30.747 --> 17:33.816
- You did it!
- Woo-hoo!

17:37.721 --> 17:40.088
- That was fast!
- Yeah!

17:40.123 --> 17:41.957
What was that?
Like two, three seconds, tops.

17:41.991 --> 17:45.027
And he kept his stride,
he stayed right on it.

17:45.061 --> 17:46.829
- So, what's next?
- I think it's time to call Casey.

17:46.863 --> 17:48.396
Oh, yes!

17:49.665 --> 17:51.300
- Hey!
- Hey.

17:51.334 --> 17:53.735
How's it going, uh, with Crystal?

17:53.769 --> 17:56.071
So far, so good. I mean...

17:56.105 --> 18:00.408
Yeah, she's got a ton of pictures and...
stories and...

18:00.443 --> 18:04.379
Yeah, I bet she does.

18:04.413 --> 18:06.481
What... what's that supposed to mean?

18:06.515 --> 18:11.829
- I thought this is what you wanted?
- Yeah. No. It was.

18:12.655 --> 18:14.823
There's just...
There's something about Crystal

18:14.857 --> 18:17.726
I can't quite put my finger on and...

18:17.760 --> 18:19.994
Okay, for example,
Georgie is her only niece,

18:20.028 --> 18:22.063
so why didn't Crystal bother looking her up

18:22.097 --> 18:24.732
the whole time she was in foster homes?

18:24.766 --> 18:27.101
Well, that's a good question,
but you know what, honey?

18:27.135 --> 18:30.338
Georgie's having a really good
time with Crystal right now.

18:30.372 --> 18:32.573
She's learning a lot, getting a good
education about her birth family.

18:32.607 --> 18:35.259
Let's just... don't ruin it for her, okay?

18:35.279 --> 18:38.311
Yeah. For sure.

18:38.346 --> 18:39.980
Okay.
So my mom and dad, your grandparents...

18:40.014 --> 18:42.783
This is Michael and Sylvia Norwood.

18:42.817 --> 18:44.651
Then your grandmother...
you would have loved her.

18:44.686 --> 18:46.987
She sang in nightclubs.

18:47.021 --> 18:50.223
And dad... he really loved baseball.

18:50.258 --> 18:52.325
But, uh, you know,
he was a Wildcat oil man,

18:52.360 --> 18:55.128
so we were always on the move.

18:55.162 --> 18:57.864
I guess that's why I
never really settled down.

18:57.899 --> 19:00.133
And... what about my mom and dad?

19:00.167 --> 19:03.803
Oh, your dad?
He was a real charmer.

19:03.837 --> 19:05.738
Your mom said that she took one look at him

19:05.773 --> 19:07.908
and she knew that that was
the man she was gonna marry.

19:07.942 --> 19:09.675
So that's them on their wedding day.

19:09.710 --> 19:11.944
- Wow.
- Yeah.

19:11.978 --> 19:15.894
And this...
this is your mom when she was 18.

19:16.850 --> 19:18.584
When we were kids,
we weren't just sisters, you know?

19:18.619 --> 19:21.721
We were... best friends.

19:21.755 --> 19:22.988
We could spend hours talking,
and it was like it was

19:23.023 --> 19:26.058
just the two of us against the world.

19:26.092 --> 19:28.727
It's kinda like how I feel
when I'm here with you.

19:28.761 --> 19:31.063
And I want you to know that
no matter what happens,

19:31.097 --> 19:34.566
I'll always be here for you, okay?

19:34.600 --> 19:37.436
Kinda like... my godmother?

19:37.470 --> 19:39.096
How about your fairy godmother?

19:43.776 --> 19:46.745
- Here. Let me have a look at you.
- Okay.

19:46.779 --> 19:48.780
Where'd you get this shirt, Georgie?

19:48.815 --> 19:50.982
Um... I-I think it was Amy's?

19:51.016 --> 19:53.284
Yeah? What about the jeans?

19:53.319 --> 19:55.987
I think they were from...
Big Bob's outdoor store.

19:56.021 --> 19:58.690
- They were on sale.
- Hmm...

19:58.724 --> 20:01.492
So does Lou always dress you in...

20:01.526 --> 20:04.429
hand-me-downs and discount things?

20:04.463 --> 20:07.432
I'm-I'm...
I'm just not really that into fashion.

20:07.466 --> 20:10.468
Honey,
I'm not just talking about-about fashion.

20:10.502 --> 20:14.238
I'm talking about self-expression.

20:14.273 --> 20:17.675
I'm talking about grabbing
people's attention and keeping it,

20:17.709 --> 20:20.911
about becoming the
person that you wanna be.

20:20.946 --> 20:24.181
You are such a pretty girl, Georgie.

20:24.215 --> 20:26.116
I just feel like it's a
shame that you wanna hide it

20:26.150 --> 20:28.519
underneath all these... scruffy clothes

20:28.553 --> 20:30.788
and your hair all pulled back tight.

20:33.458 --> 20:35.658
You know, I have a fun idea!

20:35.693 --> 20:39.096
Hmm. Yeah.

20:39.130 --> 20:41.865
Yeah, that's great news, man.
Of course!

20:41.899 --> 20:43.700
Uh, well, I gotta work tonight, but, um...

20:43.734 --> 20:46.479
Yeah, sounds good.

20:46.737 --> 20:48.605
Okay, bye.

20:48.639 --> 20:50.974
So...?

20:51.008 --> 20:53.977
Caleb. Sale's in the bag.

20:54.011 --> 20:56.078
We're gonna meet tomorrow night.

20:56.113 --> 21:00.020
Well...
you don't sound very happy about it.

21:00.951 --> 21:02.819
I'm happy, I'm just uh...

21:02.853 --> 21:05.922
not looking forward to telling him.

21:05.956 --> 21:08.457
You think too much, Ty.

21:08.492 --> 21:11.060
Maybe you should start focusing
on your long term goals.

21:11.094 --> 21:14.596
Hey, I know what I'm aiming for.

21:14.631 --> 21:16.532
I wanna be a vet... But I want to be a vet

21:16.566 --> 21:18.501
who's married to a woman he loves,

21:18.535 --> 21:22.071
have a great family, good friends.

21:22.105 --> 21:25.446
A truck, really cool motorcycle...

21:26.275 --> 21:29.966
Maybe a dog. I've never had a dog.

21:31.347 --> 21:32.814
You know, that sounds a little less focused

21:32.849 --> 21:35.116
than you think it does.

21:35.151 --> 21:37.686
But that's okay. That's all right.

21:37.720 --> 21:41.189
It just makes me look more focused.

21:44.760 --> 21:46.294
Any word from Georgie?

21:46.328 --> 21:48.896
Nope.

21:48.931 --> 21:51.299
You think we should give her a call or...?

21:51.333 --> 21:54.035
Who's worried now?

21:54.070 --> 21:55.970
- Hello! We're back!
- Hey!

22:00.175 --> 22:02.043
Ta-da!

22:03.278 --> 22:04.712
Holy!

22:04.746 --> 22:07.084
What happened to your face?

22:08.617 --> 22:12.786
Uh-I mean... You look so grown up!

22:12.820 --> 22:16.690
- Yeah.
- No! Georgie, I didn't...

22:16.724 --> 22:18.092
Maybe I should go talk to her.

22:18.126 --> 22:19.926
I had no idea you'd be
so uptight about this.

22:19.961 --> 22:23.714
Crystal, please. I'll talk to her.

22:24.732 --> 22:26.700
Georgie...

22:26.734 --> 22:30.870
Oh, honey... Let me help you.

22:30.905 --> 22:33.406
I don't want any help!

22:33.440 --> 22:36.943
Look, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry for what I said, okay?

22:36.978 --> 22:38.845
But washing your face with water,

22:38.879 --> 22:41.147
it's not gonna do anything.

22:41.181 --> 22:44.865
Here, let me do it. Come on.

22:44.885 --> 22:46.519
Hey... hey...

22:46.553 --> 22:49.188
It's okay.

22:49.223 --> 22:52.891
Look. Maybe, next time,
just a little less eye goop.

22:52.926 --> 22:57.130
Unless you're going to a costume ball,
okay?

22:57.164 --> 22:59.599
We just went shopping and...
Crystal gave me a makeover.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.467
It was just for fun.

23:01.502 --> 23:03.568
Crystal is a lot of fun,

23:03.603 --> 23:05.904
and this shade of lipstick
looks great on her,

23:05.939 --> 23:08.974
but... maybe not on a girl your age.

23:09.009 --> 23:11.644
She says that it's important
to make a big statement

23:11.678 --> 23:13.345
because it doesn't matter

23:13.379 --> 23:15.914
if you're the smartest person in the room

23:15.949 --> 23:19.817
if nobody even notices
that you're in the room.

23:19.852 --> 23:22.854
That's one way of looking at it.

23:22.888 --> 23:25.157
But I don't know how old Crystal is...

23:25.191 --> 23:27.859
but she needs help to
look the way she looks.

23:27.893 --> 23:29.661
At your age, you don't need any help.

23:29.695 --> 23:31.196
Do you understand?

23:31.230 --> 23:34.566
You're gorgeous just the way you are.

23:34.600 --> 23:38.909
She says I look like my mom.

23:44.543 --> 23:46.044
I hate her. I hate her.

23:46.078 --> 23:48.379
I mean, she makes me feel like a frump.

23:48.413 --> 23:52.550
You know, like a prude, an old fuddy-duddy.

23:52.584 --> 23:54.151
Well, I know from personal experience
that you're none of those things.

23:54.186 --> 23:56.019
Yeah, but Georgie doesn't.

23:56.054 --> 23:57.020
You know, I wish grandpa was here.

23:57.055 --> 23:58.955
He would take one look at Crystal

23:58.990 --> 24:01.024
and send her packing so fast her head spin.

24:01.059 --> 24:02.259
Honey, I told you, if you need someone

24:02.294 --> 24:04.161
to send Crystal packing, I'm your man.

24:04.196 --> 24:07.665
No, I'm sorry.
I didn't- I didn't mean that. I just...

24:07.699 --> 24:10.266
How am I supposed to compete
with someone like her?

24:10.301 --> 24:12.468
You don't have to compete with her.

24:12.503 --> 24:13.904
You're Georgie's mom.

24:13.938 --> 24:15.371
Crystal will never come between that,

24:15.406 --> 24:20.410
no matter how fun and sexy she is.
It's not...

24:20.444 --> 24:23.180
- "Thinks" she is. I didn't...
- So she's sexy?

24:23.214 --> 24:28.351
It's just an observation.
It's nothing personal.

24:28.385 --> 24:30.086
Okay, so are you the one I
need to be worried about?

24:30.120 --> 24:33.256
No, of course not.

24:33.290 --> 24:35.157
But we shouldn't be worried
about Georgie either.

24:37.861 --> 24:41.831
And exactly what is so damn sexy about her?

24:41.865 --> 24:43.899
What?

24:50.217 --> 24:52.947
- Georgie?
- Back here.

24:57.609 --> 25:00.855
Oh, there you are.
What are you doing?

25:00.875 --> 25:04.048
Well, I'm mucking out.
It's one of my chores.

25:04.083 --> 25:06.050
- Mucking out?
- Yeah.

25:06.085 --> 25:08.786
What other chores do you have?

25:08.820 --> 25:12.590
Um, well...
I make sure the horses have food and water,

25:12.624 --> 25:15.993
I turn them out, keep the barn clean,
the bins stocked.

25:16.027 --> 25:18.095
And you do that all by yourself?

25:18.129 --> 25:21.331
Sometimes Jack and Amy help out,
but most of the time it's just me.

25:21.365 --> 25:23.166
Oh, and I have a new horse.

25:23.201 --> 25:26.103
Come on, I'll show you.

25:26.137 --> 25:28.638
- Come on!
- Okay.

25:28.672 --> 25:31.040
This is Checkers.
He's my trick riding horse.

25:31.075 --> 25:33.009
- Trick riding?
- Yeah!

25:33.043 --> 25:34.311
Well, that sounds fun!

25:34.345 --> 25:36.313
Yeah, I take lessons.

25:36.347 --> 25:38.915
We do cool tricks on a horse
while it gallops around the ring.

25:38.949 --> 25:40.750
Well, I'd love to see that.

25:40.784 --> 25:43.553
Well, I'm not very good at it yet.

25:43.588 --> 25:45.655
I mean, I usually do it with Amy.

25:45.689 --> 25:48.157
I'm not allowed to do it
without adult supervision.

25:48.191 --> 25:50.259
Well, that's what I'm here for, Georgie.

25:50.293 --> 25:52.695
I'm adult supervision. Huh?

25:52.730 --> 25:55.083
And listen...

25:55.103 --> 25:57.299
don't you go around through life
telling people what you can't do.

25:57.334 --> 25:59.435
You tell them what you can do.

25:59.469 --> 26:01.937
You tell 'em straight so they believe you,
right?

26:02.544 --> 26:04.240
Okay.

26:04.274 --> 26:07.376
You should go show me what you can do, huh?

26:07.410 --> 26:08.444
Okay.

26:10.213 --> 26:13.215
Isn't that your dad?

26:13.250 --> 26:15.284
- Oh no.
- What's the problem?

26:15.318 --> 26:17.453
Come on, Caleb. My dad bulldogging?

26:17.487 --> 26:20.689
He's gonna kill himself
trying to impress her.

26:20.723 --> 26:24.126
Hey, Amy,
this the guy you told me about?

26:24.160 --> 26:25.927
What're you doing here, dad?

26:25.962 --> 26:29.898
Casey called me.
She wanted me to check him out.

26:29.932 --> 26:31.332
Well, I just thought,
when it came to bulldogging,

26:31.367 --> 26:34.469
who's the big expert around here, right?

26:34.503 --> 26:36.771
How's he look to you, Tim?

26:36.805 --> 26:38.773
He looks good. Good muscle.

26:38.807 --> 26:41.742
Steady.

26:41.777 --> 26:43.944
So what do you say?
You wanna see what he's got?

26:43.979 --> 26:45.946
Yeah, you should see me go, dad.

26:45.981 --> 26:47.615
I'm getting really good at
getting him in the zone.

26:47.650 --> 26:49.517
You know what, Amy?

26:49.552 --> 26:52.386
I don't know how much that's
actually gonna tell us.

26:52.420 --> 26:56.590
Bulldogging is, after all,
a big man's game.

26:56.624 --> 26:59.120
Well, not necessarily.

27:00.287 --> 27:02.930
But if... If-if Casey needs to
see a heavyweight in the saddle,

27:02.964 --> 27:05.066
somebody who knows what he's doing...

27:05.100 --> 27:07.668
Yeah! Caleb here has been so excited

27:07.702 --> 27:08.968
to show you what he's got, right?

27:09.003 --> 27:12.495
Uh... yeah. All set to go.

27:14.242 --> 27:15.576
Well...

27:21.749 --> 27:22.583
Hi-yah!

27:26.854 --> 27:28.354
Ungh!

27:35.830 --> 27:38.464
Woo!
What'd you think of that, Casey?

27:38.498 --> 27:39.733
I think you just sold me a horse.

27:39.767 --> 27:42.568
- All right!
- Pretty impressive.

27:42.603 --> 27:44.837
Twist my arm, I'll let you have him.

27:44.871 --> 27:46.872
No, you can't just give me a horse.

27:46.906 --> 27:47.873
Well, I'm not gonna give you a horse,

27:47.907 --> 27:49.575
but I'll sell him to you at cost.

27:49.610 --> 27:51.310
Oh, okay, all right. Sure.

27:51.345 --> 27:52.678
If you're gonna "sell" him to me?

27:52.713 --> 27:54.880
You don't mind, right, Caleb?

27:54.914 --> 27:57.182
Course not.
As long as I'm making a sale.

27:57.217 --> 27:58.917
See,
the whole time we were out on the circuit,

27:58.952 --> 28:01.720
your dad just kept talking up
the good old days, you know,

28:01.755 --> 28:04.422
and how he wanted to get
back into bulldogging, but...

28:04.457 --> 28:06.324
he never did anything about it.

28:06.359 --> 28:09.128
I'm just... giving him a little push.

28:09.162 --> 28:10.796
Isn't that great, dad?

28:10.830 --> 28:13.132
Your very own, shiny new bulldogging horse.

28:13.166 --> 28:15.667
Just what you've always wanted.

28:15.701 --> 28:20.274
Yeah. Yeah. All right.
You got yourself a deal.

28:25.622 --> 28:28.045
All right.
I wanna see your best trick.

28:28.080 --> 28:30.314
I want you to amaze me.

28:30.348 --> 28:32.016
Um... o-o-okay.

28:32.050 --> 28:36.520
Um... well,
there's something called the side backbend.

28:36.554 --> 28:39.390
Wow, okay. Now that sounds good!

28:39.424 --> 28:41.759
Okay...

28:41.794 --> 28:44.361
Okay.

28:54.972 --> 28:56.907
Whoa!

28:58.943 --> 29:01.144
Georgie?

29:03.314 --> 29:04.948
Georgie?! Are you-are you okay?

29:04.982 --> 29:06.582
Ungh!

29:06.617 --> 29:10.486
Georgie! Georgie!

29:10.521 --> 29:12.555
- Oh God...
- Ow!

29:12.589 --> 29:14.925
- Oh, honey... Lou!
- Ow! Ow!

29:14.959 --> 29:16.827
- Peter!
- Ow...

29:16.861 --> 29:20.630
- Oh, honey... oh my God.
- Ow...

29:20.664 --> 29:23.165
Peter, I think Georgie's hurt!

29:25.168 --> 29:26.251
- I don't think you should get up!
- No! No!

29:26.271 --> 29:27.503
Lou!

29:27.538 --> 29:29.939
Get the car, honey, and bring Katie!

29:29.973 --> 29:33.042
Okay, okay. Go slow.

29:33.076 --> 29:35.545
- Ow... ow...
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

29:35.579 --> 29:36.511
- Georgie!
- Ow!

29:36.546 --> 29:38.747
Honey, what happened?

29:38.781 --> 29:40.682
It's her arm.
She was trying to show me a trick.

29:40.717 --> 29:42.218
And you let her?!

29:42.252 --> 29:44.119
She knows she's not
supposed to without Amy here.

29:44.154 --> 29:45.754
You can't blame her!
It's all my fault!

29:45.788 --> 29:49.558
- No, no, honey.
- Ow! Ow! Ow...

29:49.592 --> 29:50.960
Okay, sweetheart, come here.
We're gonna go to the hospital.

29:50.994 --> 29:53.194
Ow! Ow...

29:53.229 --> 29:55.764
Okay, okay.

29:55.798 --> 29:56.665
Okay, well,
tell me where you're going...

29:56.699 --> 29:57.866
No, no, we've got it from here.

29:57.900 --> 30:01.069
Just... just stay here. We can handle it.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.971
- Ow...
- You're okay, honey.

30:03.005 --> 30:05.674
Georgie? Honey, just remember,

30:05.708 --> 30:06.842
that wasn't doesn't kill you,
makes you stronger.

30:06.876 --> 30:08.309
Crystal? Shut up!

30:08.344 --> 30:09.543
Do me a favour, Crystal?
Close that gate

30:09.578 --> 30:10.544
so the horse doesn't get out, please?

30:10.579 --> 30:12.113
We'll call you with updates.

30:17.519 --> 30:19.587
Bye, you guys!

30:24.279 --> 30:26.414
I know!

30:26.434 --> 30:29.897
Why didn't you just tell her you
weren't serious about bulldogging?!

30:29.931 --> 30:32.132
It almost killed you once,
isn't that enough?

30:32.166 --> 30:34.935
I should have.
I couldn't because this thing with Casey,

30:34.969 --> 30:37.705
it could be serious and I didn't
want to come across as some...

30:37.739 --> 30:42.009
over-the-hill blowhard, that...
is all hat and no horse.

30:42.043 --> 30:45.712
Dad, do you know how stupid that sounds?

30:45.746 --> 30:47.948
But it's also kind of sweet.

30:47.982 --> 30:50.279
You got a good deal on the horse.

30:56.157 --> 30:59.371
So, Caleb, we really need to talk.

30:59.391 --> 31:01.795
Yeah. Definitely. I mean,
things are really starting to heat up.

31:01.829 --> 31:03.930
We got new contacts, new connections.

31:03.964 --> 31:05.364
You know, if we want to stay on top,

31:05.399 --> 31:07.667
we really should develop
a strategy for the future.

31:07.701 --> 31:09.969
Well,
that's exactly what I'm talking about.

31:10.003 --> 31:13.843
- Oh! Hey, Ty...
- Cass, hey. Uh...

31:13.863 --> 31:17.076
You remember Caleb, right?

31:17.110 --> 31:19.545
We were just talking business right now.

31:19.579 --> 31:22.248
Hm. Well, I'm meeting someone,
so I'm gonna go look for him.

31:22.282 --> 31:24.750
No way. Sit down.
You gotta help us celebrate our big sale.

31:24.784 --> 31:28.020
Yeah, I don't think so.
He's around here somewhere.

31:28.055 --> 31:29.404
If a guy couldn't
pick you out of a crowded room

31:29.424 --> 31:30.423
he'd have to be blind.

31:31.691 --> 31:33.826
What're you drinking?

31:33.860 --> 31:36.495
Bourbon and branch. But sorry, Caleb.

31:36.529 --> 31:37.795
I'm drinking it with my boyfriend.

31:39.531 --> 31:43.100
Oh. Boyfriend.

31:44.970 --> 31:46.771
Anyone home?

31:46.805 --> 31:48.272
Oh! In here, Amy.

31:48.306 --> 31:50.875
Where is everyone?

31:50.909 --> 31:52.142
You don't know? I can't...

31:52.177 --> 31:53.945
I can't believe that Lou didn't call you!

31:53.979 --> 31:55.846
There's been an accident.
Georgie hurt herself trick riding.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.515
She hurt herself? W-where are they?

31:58.549 --> 32:01.618
Lou and Peter took her to emergency,
the local hospital, I-I guess.

32:01.652 --> 32:03.887
What was
she doing trick riding?

32:03.921 --> 32:04.855
She says she's been working with you.

32:04.889 --> 32:06.991
I-I just assumed it was okay.

32:07.025 --> 32:11.112
Lou, hi. Um... is Georgie okay?
Where are you guys?

32:13.259 --> 32:15.853
What's Cass'
boyfriend got what I don''t got?

32:16.012 --> 32:19.614
I mean, I'm an okay...
to reasonably handsome looking man.

32:19.648 --> 32:21.516
Now w-what is it? Just the money?

32:21.550 --> 32:24.458
Nothing's ever just about the money, Caleb.

32:24.478 --> 32:26.287
- I mean look at you and me...
- That's the whole problem right there

32:26.321 --> 32:28.222
in the proverbial nutshell, isn't it?

32:28.256 --> 32:29.490
You know what we need to do?
We need to make more money...

32:29.525 --> 32:31.926
Caleb, would you just let me finish?

32:31.960 --> 32:33.761
'Kay.

32:33.796 --> 32:37.164
I need you to buy me out
of our partnership, okay?

32:37.198 --> 32:39.833
I just can't handle it right now
and vet school's really intense.

32:39.867 --> 32:41.435
And I got a lot going on with Scott.

32:41.469 --> 32:43.337
You can relax. I'm kinda doing

32:43.371 --> 32:44.704
all the heavy lifting on my side, brother.

32:44.739 --> 32:48.342
I-I know, but... The horse business...

32:48.376 --> 32:50.811
It's getting in the way
of my long term goals.

32:50.845 --> 32:53.414
Man, we came here to celebrate a sale,

32:53.448 --> 32:54.781
and you're telling me you don't
wanna be in business with me anymore

32:54.816 --> 32:56.983
because of some long term goals?

32:57.017 --> 32:59.385
That's like splitting up on the honeymoon.

32:59.420 --> 33:02.188
I know, Caleb, I know.

33:02.222 --> 33:05.492
But we'll still be buddies though, right?

33:05.526 --> 33:08.495
Hey, guys, let's make this a party!

33:08.529 --> 33:11.030
Jesse Stanton.

33:11.065 --> 33:12.832
You're the boyfriend.

33:12.866 --> 33:16.602
Yes, and you're still the jackass
who dumped my sister.

33:16.636 --> 33:19.439
So...
how's the horse business going, fellas?

33:25.980 --> 33:27.680
Oh, Georgie, are you all right?!

33:27.714 --> 33:30.015
Uh, yeah, I broke my arm.

33:30.049 --> 33:31.817
It's just a hairline fracture.
She'll be okay.

33:31.852 --> 33:34.720
- Uh, where's Crystal?
- In there.

33:34.754 --> 33:36.722
- Can you please put Katie in bed?
- Yup.

33:36.756 --> 33:38.675
'Kay,
let's get you upstairs too, honey, okay?

33:38.695 --> 33:40.158
Yeah.

33:40.193 --> 33:43.063
I need to have a little talk with Crystal.

33:46.232 --> 33:50.057
Uh-oh.
Sounds like someone's in trouble.

33:51.537 --> 33:53.238
Am I grounded?

33:53.272 --> 33:56.141
No, no.
Of course you're not grounded, honey.

33:56.175 --> 33:58.977
You may want to think about staying
off a horse for a while though.

33:59.012 --> 34:01.779
I know I wasn't
supposed to be trick-riding.

34:01.814 --> 34:05.783
Well, good.
We're glad that you know that.

34:05.818 --> 34:08.284
We understand though, okay?

34:08.320 --> 34:12.757
I know that your aunt Crystal can
be a little overwhelming at times?

34:12.791 --> 34:14.492
I had no idea what she was gonna do.

34:14.527 --> 34:17.594
I tried to warn her, but it was too late.

34:17.630 --> 34:19.963
She is just a very brave and determined
little girl. She's just like her mother.

34:19.998 --> 34:21.899
You know, Crystal, I can't help but feel

34:21.933 --> 34:24.534
that you're trying to
undermine my authority.

34:24.569 --> 34:27.338
Hardly. I... You're just upset

34:27.371 --> 34:29.273
because Georgie's taking her
first steps at independence

34:29.306 --> 34:30.641
and you're losing control.

34:30.675 --> 34:33.077
No, no. That's not it at all.

34:33.110 --> 34:36.246
Okay, second guess.

34:36.280 --> 34:40.083
You're trying to keep me away from Georgie
because I'm actually related to her.

34:40.117 --> 34:42.385
She said she wanted
to see something amazing,

34:42.420 --> 34:45.822
so I tried to show her the side backbend,
but I'm just learning,

34:45.857 --> 34:49.059
and I told her I knew how to do it.

34:49.092 --> 34:53.096
I didn't wanna
disappoint her and...

34:53.130 --> 34:55.797
she thinks she's making me
feel better about myself,

34:55.831 --> 34:59.436
but she just keeps making me feel worse!

35:03.607 --> 35:05.141
Come here.

35:05.176 --> 35:08.378
- Ow!
- Sorry.

35:09.245 --> 35:11.246
She was two years old
when she lost her parents

35:11.281 --> 35:13.082
and she doesn't even remember you.

35:13.116 --> 35:14.717
And no matter what you think, Crystal,

35:14.751 --> 35:16.852
Georgie is part of this family.

35:16.887 --> 35:20.389
Yes. Now. It's only been a couple of years.

35:20.423 --> 35:23.292
She was born into my family.

35:23.326 --> 35:25.927
Let me spell it out for
you and be perfectly clear.

35:25.962 --> 35:28.964
Georgie is my daughter, I am her mother.

35:28.998 --> 35:32.000
Katie is her sister,
and Peter is her father.

35:32.034 --> 35:34.603
Yes, and I am her aunt.
She is my sister's daughter,

35:34.637 --> 35:36.205
and I have the right
to spend time with her.

35:36.239 --> 35:38.240
Not unless we say so.

35:38.274 --> 35:39.841
Well, you can't stop her,
Lou, because she can make her own...

35:39.875 --> 35:41.743
Okay, I've just been
upstairs talking to my daughter,

35:41.777 --> 35:45.013
and Crystal, I think you should leave.

35:45.047 --> 35:48.850
Right now. Just...
just pack up your stuff and go, okay?

35:48.884 --> 35:52.220
You... you can't do this.
You've got no legal right

35:52.254 --> 35:54.355
to stop me from seeing my niece.

35:54.389 --> 35:57.158
You've got no legal right
to keep her away from me.

35:57.192 --> 35:58.892
But it is our house
and we do have the legal right

35:58.927 --> 36:01.695
to tell you to get the hell out of here.

36:01.730 --> 36:03.731
Look,
I don't know what it is

36:03.765 --> 36:06.400
that you think that you're
protecting Georgie from.

36:06.435 --> 36:08.536
I mean, I know you're trying to be
really good parents and everything,

36:08.570 --> 36:11.905
but I can tell that the way that you
are going about it is totally wrong.

36:11.940 --> 36:15.562
And you watch,
because it is gonna backfire on you.

36:33.528 --> 36:34.894
Georgie?

36:38.399 --> 36:41.601
What happened? Where's Crystal?

36:41.636 --> 36:42.869
Where's she going?

36:42.903 --> 36:44.504
I don't know. And right now,

36:44.539 --> 36:47.740
I don't care, as long as she goes.

36:47.775 --> 36:49.042
I didn't mean for any of this to happen.

36:49.076 --> 36:51.044
I know, honey.

36:51.078 --> 36:52.945
I mean...

36:52.980 --> 36:55.114
I mean, how could I even listen to her.

36:55.149 --> 36:57.283
All that stuff about me
being just like my mom?

36:57.317 --> 37:00.619
She doesn't even know me!
How can she even say that?

37:00.654 --> 37:06.445
- Georgie...
- I... I just...

37:07.527 --> 37:10.354
I wanted to know more about my mom.

37:12.047 --> 37:17.065
So did I. Come here.
It's okay. I love you.

37:17.085 --> 37:19.871
I love you, too.

37:19.906 --> 37:21.973
So I bring
my best friend into the mix,

37:22.008 --> 37:24.542
above all odds,
we tough it out and come out on top.

37:24.577 --> 37:26.410
And what's he do? He up and quits on me!

37:26.444 --> 37:27.945
Know what? Here's to getting out

37:27.979 --> 37:31.348
while the getting's good, hey, Ty?

37:31.382 --> 37:34.085
Hey, listen, man.
I feel your pain, okay? I do.

37:34.119 --> 37:36.120
But maybe I can help you guys out.

37:36.154 --> 37:38.488
I've got the one thing that you both need.

37:38.523 --> 37:41.325
A super hot girlfriend?

37:41.359 --> 37:46.096
No, Caleb. Capital.
Liquidity. Cold hard cash.

37:46.130 --> 37:48.665
And I think I have a way
that can make everyone happy.

37:48.700 --> 37:50.634
Really, Jesse?
I didn't come here to talk about business.

37:50.668 --> 37:52.536
Hey,
this'll just take a second, okay?

37:52.570 --> 37:54.504
So here's what I wanna put on the table.

37:54.539 --> 37:57.705
I buy Ty's loan from you...

37:58.075 --> 38:01.577
And I buy your partnership
with Caleb from you.

38:02.713 --> 38:04.480
So I'm out and he's in?

38:04.514 --> 38:06.449
Or I'm in, and he's out?

38:06.483 --> 38:09.318
Gentlemen,
you're missing the point here.

38:09.353 --> 38:11.254
Caleb, you get the capital that
you need to run your business,

38:11.288 --> 38:13.256
and Ty, you want out,

38:13.290 --> 38:16.559
so whether I'm in or not
has nothing to do with you.

38:16.593 --> 38:18.461
Well, business is business.

38:18.495 --> 38:20.863
Hey! Listen up.

38:20.897 --> 38:24.746
- Don't do this. You're drunk, okay?
- Stay out of this.

38:24.766 --> 38:26.335
Yeah, man.
Let me go. I need me some of that capital.

38:26.370 --> 38:27.670
No, you don't.
You're gonna regret this,

38:27.704 --> 38:30.573
- I guarantee it.
- Shut up, Ty!

38:30.607 --> 38:32.340
The last thing you wanna do is
go into business with Jesse Stanton.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.743
Partners.

38:34.778 --> 38:36.211
There we go. That wasn't so hard, was it?

38:36.246 --> 38:37.913
Not at all.

38:37.947 --> 38:38.947
Ungh!

38:38.982 --> 38:41.316
- Jesse!
- Ungh!

38:41.350 --> 38:42.918
I've been waiting to do
that for seven years.

38:42.952 --> 38:44.286
- All right?
- Ungh!

38:47.090 --> 38:49.591
You just punched my best friend.

38:49.625 --> 38:52.745
You've made a huge mistake.

39:14.689 --> 39:16.302
Peter.

39:16.857 --> 39:19.562
No car.
She's actually gone!

39:19.644 --> 39:22.367
Let me check to make sure.

39:24.749 --> 39:30.008
Yup,
she's definitely gone.

39:30.889 --> 39:34.191
- What's that?
- A photo album.

39:34.225 --> 39:37.511
- Some parting words there?
- Yeah.

39:37.531 --> 39:41.365
"Dearest Georgie,
I'm sorry to leave without saying goodbye,

39:41.399 --> 39:42.866
but I didn't want to over-stay my welcome."

39:42.900 --> 39:45.202
Huh. Too late for that.

39:45.236 --> 39:47.070
"My family photo album is for you,

39:47.104 --> 39:50.874
and I know you will treasure it.
All my love, Crystal.

39:50.908 --> 39:54.284
PS. don't let them turn
you into a pumpkin!"

39:54.304 --> 39:56.213
"Turn you into a pumpkin?"
What's that supposed to mean?

39:56.247 --> 39:59.292
I have no idea.

39:59.312 --> 40:01.852
I shook on it, man.
I can't weasel out of it now.

40:01.886 --> 40:04.888
You were drunk...
and he punched me in the face!

40:04.922 --> 40:06.856
Yeah, that's true.

40:06.890 --> 40:08.324
I got in a pretty damn good one though,
hey?

40:10.260 --> 40:12.094
I really don't believe you guys.

40:12.128 --> 40:14.497
You're hung over, you-you look terrible,

40:14.531 --> 40:17.600
and what?
You got in some stupid fight last night?

40:17.634 --> 40:19.902
Let's just say that beer
and business don't mix.

40:19.936 --> 40:21.738
Incidentally,
neither do friends and business,

40:21.772 --> 40:23.372
but nothing that couldn't be worked out

40:23.406 --> 40:25.574
with a night in the can.

40:25.608 --> 40:29.338
I guess my real question is,
of all people, why did you call me?

40:31.712 --> 40:35.317
I...
I just didn't really know who else to call.

40:39.654 --> 40:42.256
Well, next time, don't.

40:42.276 --> 40:44.659
Bailing you two idiots
out of the drunk tank

40:44.694 --> 40:49.030
is not exactly how I wanna
spend my morning ever again.

40:49.064 --> 40:53.034
Hurry up!
Get in the truck or I'll leave you here.

40:58.073 --> 41:01.575
Did I mention I hate you guys?

41:01.610 --> 41:02.944
What happened to bringing a trailer?

41:02.978 --> 41:06.347
You gonna ride this guy home?

41:06.382 --> 41:08.689
Casey, that's just it. I...

41:10.119 --> 41:12.286
I can't buy this horse from you.

41:12.320 --> 41:14.422
Why not? He's a great bulldogging horse.

41:14.456 --> 41:17.291
You saw how he ran.
He's right on target every time.

41:17.325 --> 41:19.493
Yeah, I know, and that's why
it'll be easier sell to somebody else...

41:19.528 --> 41:21.995
anybody but not me. I can't buy him.

41:22.030 --> 41:24.364
All this stuff about me
wanting to get back into rodeo

41:24.399 --> 41:25.633
and it being in my blood...

41:25.667 --> 41:28.368
That was BS?

41:28.403 --> 41:33.254
Yeah. I don't know.
Maybe I'm just losing my edge.

41:33.274 --> 41:35.074
You know...

41:37.545 --> 41:40.213
Oh, really?

41:40.248 --> 41:43.583
You knew... This whole time.

41:43.617 --> 41:45.885
I had a pretty good idea.

41:45.905 --> 41:49.955
So what was this whole
thing about buying a horse?

41:51.631 --> 41:54.293
I wanted to give you a
chance to come clean.

41:57.115 --> 41:58.531
Okay,
I'm gonna tell you something right now.

41:58.566 --> 42:01.893
I am not killing myself to impress you.

42:02.911 --> 42:04.937
You know what, Tim?

42:04.972 --> 42:06.205
It takes a lot of guts for a man to admit

42:06.239 --> 42:09.070
when he can't do something.

42:09.090 --> 42:11.210
It's one of the things I like about you.

42:11.244 --> 42:13.116
You got guts.

42:15.148 --> 42:18.274
Okay, see,
you had me there up to the end and then...

42:18.294 --> 42:22.420
Say I have guts for quitting
something I love...? Tsk.

42:27.226 --> 42:28.827
Just as long as you don't quit me.

42:33.800 --> 42:35.800
You know,
you wanting us to get back together

42:35.834 --> 42:38.103
might be one of the smartest
things you've done in a while.

42:38.137 --> 42:40.846
Agh!

42:41.764 --> 42:44.376
You asked to get back together, remember?

42:44.916 --> 42:46.478
Oh, yeah.

42:46.512 --> 42:49.414
Ungh! Good call on my part.

42:53.223 --> 42:56.954
And this is my grandfather Michael Crawley,

42:56.989 --> 43:00.357
and his wife, Sylvie.
And this is my aunt Crystal,

43:00.392 --> 43:02.693
and finally, my birth parents,

43:02.728 --> 43:05.029
Matthew Crawley, and my mom, Mary.

43:05.063 --> 43:07.131
But they died a long time ago,

43:07.165 --> 43:09.366
and even though they are a
very important part of my life

43:09.401 --> 43:12.069
and I wish I could remember them,

43:12.103 --> 43:15.839
my real parents are right here
with my cute little sister, Katie.

43:15.873 --> 43:19.910
My mom, Lou Fleming-Morris,
and my dad, Peter Morris.

43:19.944 --> 43:22.379
Ta-da!

43:22.414 --> 43:24.748
Georgie, that's really sweet.

43:24.782 --> 43:26.315
It's a great presentation, sweetheart.

43:26.350 --> 43:28.652
Thank you.

43:32.020 --> 43:33.662
On the next Heartland,

43:33.682 --> 43:36.633
saving wild horses brings them together.

43:36.653 --> 43:37.625
It's a horse trap.

43:37.645 --> 43:40.540
But can Ty and
Amy put the past behind them?

43:40.560 --> 43:42.191
We can re-home them.

43:42.211 --> 43:44.114
An all new
Heartland, returns Sunday

43:44.134 --> 43:46.964
December 7th at 7:00 on CBC.
