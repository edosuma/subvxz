WEBVTT

00:03.699 --> 00:04.047
.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.875
- She didn't even consult me.

00:05.918 --> 00:07.311
She just hopped
on the phone like,

00:07.355 --> 00:10.140
"Hey, world, we're gonna
make a $10,000 car

00:10.184 --> 00:11.620
"that I haven't
bothered discussing

00:11.663 --> 00:13.187
with my
Head of Communications."

00:13.230 --> 00:15.145
Like, what is the point
of my job?

00:15.189 --> 00:16.755
- Don't start pulling
that thread.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.062
- So is a $10,000 car
even possible?

00:19.106 --> 00:20.759
- Ah, if it is,
it'd be a piece of crap.

00:20.803 --> 00:22.500
We'll have to rename it
the Payne Turd.

00:22.544 --> 00:24.067
- Well, it's my
family's name

00:24.111 --> 00:25.503
who's gonna be forever
tied to the turd?

00:25.547 --> 00:27.331
- Pretty sure it's been
tied to worse.

00:27.375 --> 00:28.941
- Like what?
- Blood diamonds.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.117
- Nazis.
- Sex stuff.

00:30.160 --> 00:31.683
- Malcolm X assassination.

00:31.727 --> 00:34.295
- My question is,
who is the market for this?

00:34.338 --> 00:36.210
I mean, who are the people
that only have $10,000

00:36.253 --> 00:39.082
to spend on a car
but refuse to buy pre-owned?

00:39.126 --> 00:40.866
- Okay, so do we
tell Katherine

00:40.910 --> 00:43.913
that we don't think
the car is a good idea?

00:43.956 --> 00:45.828
- Oh...
- [chuckles]

00:45.871 --> 00:47.786
Or is everybody too scared?

00:47.830 --> 00:49.179
- Scared? Of Katherine?

00:49.223 --> 00:51.660
- When you say scared,
do you mean--

00:51.703 --> 00:54.532
- I once looked at a rat right
in its eye, like just...

00:56.404 --> 00:58.623
- ♪ Bom bom
bom-bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

00:58.667 --> 01:00.364
♪ Buh buh bom-bom-bom
buh bom-bom-bom-bom ♪

01:00.408 --> 01:03.715
[chorus vocalizing]

01:03.759 --> 01:06.936
- Then we can save
another $74.13

01:06.979 --> 01:09.199
by getting rid
of the passenger-side mirror?

01:09.243 --> 01:10.722
- Ooh, okay.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.202
- Are we allowed to get rid
of a sideview mirror?

01:12.246 --> 01:14.465
- Legally, you only need one.

01:14.509 --> 01:16.119
- Mm-hmm, and safety-wise?

01:16.163 --> 01:18.034
- Legally, you only need one.

01:18.078 --> 01:19.427
- So, if we take
these extensive

01:19.470 --> 01:21.690
and, some might even say
questionable, cuts,

01:21.733 --> 01:25.476
we'll be able to retail
the Pika for roughly $11,500.

01:25.520 --> 01:26.999
- Mm. Huh.

01:27.043 --> 01:28.827
Well, I promised that we would
sell the car for $10,000.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.178
- Yes, but $11,500
is the cheapest car

01:31.221 --> 01:32.570
on the market in decades.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.876
- Yeah, I know.
It's so exciting.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.225
So I guess the question is,

01:35.269 --> 01:36.835
how do we get it down
to 10 grand?

01:36.879 --> 01:38.402
- Honestly, I've been
through it a dozen times.

01:38.446 --> 01:40.230
There's nothing left to cut.

01:40.274 --> 01:41.275
- I mean, I hear that,
and you're the expert.

01:41.318 --> 01:42.754
I respect you.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.148
But what I'm asking
is not can you do it,

01:45.192 --> 01:46.367
but how will you do it?

01:46.410 --> 01:47.672
You see the difference?

01:47.716 --> 01:48.934
- Um, we can't.

01:48.978 --> 01:50.240
- Oh, oh.

01:50.284 --> 01:52.242
Let's try not to use
the C word.

01:52.286 --> 01:53.722
- Oh, he said "can't," not--

01:53.765 --> 01:55.593
- Can't, yeah.
Oh, I hate that word.

01:55.637 --> 01:57.160
Can we ban that
from the building?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.075
Hey, Dori.
Could you please write a memo?

01:59.119 --> 02:00.729
- Yep, I can do that.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.122
- Nice internalizing.

02:02.165 --> 02:04.254
- Okay, it's just that I ca--

02:04.298 --> 02:06.387
I do not currently see a way

02:06.430 --> 02:08.519
to reduce the price
any more than we already have?

02:08.563 --> 02:10.260
- Well, we're pitching
to the board tomorrow.

02:10.304 --> 02:13.698
So I look forward to seeing how
you rise to meet the challenge.

02:13.742 --> 02:16.136
Good for you.

02:19.313 --> 02:21.271
- Oh, man,
giving up your dog?

02:21.315 --> 02:22.533
- Yes.
Yeah.

02:22.577 --> 02:23.882
I thought rescuing a dog
from a shelter

02:23.926 --> 02:25.667
would give me
some sense of purpose

02:25.710 --> 02:28.452
or fill some hole in my life,
but turns out, nope.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.803
Just a giant pain in the ass.
So what's the point?

02:31.847 --> 02:33.718
- Unconditional love
and companionship?

02:33.762 --> 02:35.329
- Yeah, well,
you can get an escort

02:35.372 --> 02:36.808
for half of what it costs
to feed this thing.

02:36.852 --> 02:38.462
You interested?

02:38.506 --> 02:39.855
- No, no, no, no, no,
I'm not in market

02:39.898 --> 02:42.205
for an aggressive dog
that has biting issue?

02:42.249 --> 02:43.641
- Well, you can drug it,
you know.

02:43.685 --> 02:45.469
Pop some Dramamine
in its kibble in the morning.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.168
It'll be like a big
sleepy, furry rug all day.

02:48.211 --> 02:49.386
- Think I'm good.

02:49.430 --> 02:50.996
- Well, think about it.

02:51.040 --> 02:52.433
You know, the two of you could
really work well together.

02:52.476 --> 02:53.912
I'm sensing
a real connection.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.523
- She can't just say
"figure it out"

02:55.566 --> 02:57.307
as if the problem is
I'm just being stubborn.

02:57.351 --> 02:59.396
Some things can't be done.

02:59.440 --> 03:01.006
It'd be like saying, you know,

03:01.050 --> 03:04.227
"Go and invent time travel
or a perpetual-motion machine."

03:04.271 --> 03:06.055
- What's
a perpetual-motion machine?

03:06.098 --> 03:08.013
- It's a machine that
runs forever--it's impossible.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.580
- Doesn't seem that hard.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.365
- I think she's just
trying to motivate you.

03:11.408 --> 03:13.149
If it's really not possible,
she'll understand.

03:13.193 --> 03:15.064
She is a rational person.

03:15.107 --> 03:16.674
- Is she?
I'm not so sure.

03:16.718 --> 03:18.328
- What if you used,
like, a hand crank

03:18.372 --> 03:20.025
or something to keep
the machine going?

03:20.069 --> 03:21.375
- Nope.

03:21.418 --> 03:22.854
Thanks for the backup in there,
by the way.

03:22.898 --> 03:25.683
I appreciate it, friend.
- I didn't do anything.

03:25.727 --> 03:27.685
- Exactly.
You're the closest to her.

03:27.729 --> 03:30.688
If you're not willing to speak
truth to power, no one will.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.430
- Okay, why is it impossible?

03:33.474 --> 03:35.867
- [sighs] It violates the laws
of thermodynamics.

03:35.911 --> 03:37.695
- "The laws?" Okay, narc.

03:37.739 --> 03:40.176
- Shut up.
A, I'm not the closest to her.

03:40.220 --> 03:43.266
Don't even think she likes me.
B, you're the engineer.

03:43.310 --> 03:46.748
It's not like hearing it from
me is gonna change her mind.

03:46.791 --> 03:49.533
- Imagine if someone on
the "Titanic" told the captain,

03:49.577 --> 03:50.926
"I'm not an engineer.

03:50.969 --> 03:54.277
But are we a little short
on lifeboats?"

03:54.321 --> 03:57.019
- Fine. I'll talk to her.
- Thank you.

03:57.062 --> 03:58.281
- Hey, guys.

03:58.325 --> 03:59.717
I know you didn't mean
to do this.

03:59.761 --> 04:02.285
"Titanic"'s a bit of
a sensitive topic for me,

04:02.329 --> 04:05.288
Ten Paynes were on it,
all survived.

04:05.332 --> 04:06.594
- Shocker.

04:06.637 --> 04:10.206
- But two
of their valets didn't, so...

04:10.250 --> 04:12.556
not a nice comment.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.428
- Hey, is this your dog flyer?

04:14.471 --> 04:16.212
- Yeah, yeah, I just
sort of stuck them up.

04:16.256 --> 04:17.779
Do I need a permit
or something?

04:17.822 --> 04:19.302
- No, I was thinking about
taking him, but, you know,

04:19.346 --> 04:20.782
a dog's a big commitment.
- Ooh.

04:20.825 --> 04:22.087
No, not this one.

04:22.131 --> 04:23.741
No, he's--he's a--he's
a medium commitment.

04:23.785 --> 04:26.135
Or, actually, he's more of
a small-to-medium commitment.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.354
I think you guys
would get along.

04:27.397 --> 04:28.790
Yeah, I've got a good sense
of these things.

04:28.833 --> 04:30.879
Strong connection, I think.
- How does $800 sound?

04:30.922 --> 04:32.315
- Oh, no, don't worry.
You can have him for free.

04:32.359 --> 04:33.969
- No, I mean,
you give me $800.

04:34.012 --> 04:36.363
- No, you want me
to pay you $800 for a dog

04:36.406 --> 04:38.408
that I had to pay
the shelter to adopt.

04:38.452 --> 04:40.236
- Yes, there's expenses.

04:40.280 --> 04:42.543
You got food, vet bills.

04:42.586 --> 04:44.501
And if I'm gonna wake up
every morning and walk him,

04:44.545 --> 04:46.590
I'm going to need to buy
myself a nice watch.

04:46.634 --> 04:48.592
- I don't think that's really--

04:48.636 --> 04:50.246
- Or you can always
send him back to the pound.

04:50.290 --> 04:53.423
You know how they euthanize
dogs nobody wants, right?

04:53.467 --> 04:55.033
They just grab them by the neck

04:55.077 --> 04:58.123
and throw them in the crusher
and just like...

04:58.167 --> 05:01.997
[imitates grinding]

05:02.040 --> 05:04.782
Just so you know
what the stakes are.

05:06.697 --> 05:09.047
- [knocks on glass]
Hello. Got a minute?

05:09.091 --> 05:10.397
- Uh, yeah, sure. Come on in.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.312
Hey, um, which one do you
like better--

05:12.355 --> 05:14.183
the gray or the blue?
- The gray.

05:14.226 --> 05:15.445
- Really? The gray?
- Mm.

05:15.489 --> 05:16.968
Oh, I like the blue, too.

05:17.012 --> 05:18.796
- I was leaning
towards that, actually.

05:18.840 --> 05:20.537
- Yeah.
- Yeah, it's a Bermuda blue.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.409
So it's, you know,
a little touch of island flair.

05:22.452 --> 05:23.801
- So just with this
$10,000 car

05:23.845 --> 05:25.586
that we're pitching tomorrow...
- Mm.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.892
- Just wondering how
you're feeling about that.

05:27.936 --> 05:29.633
- I feel great.
How do you feel?

05:29.677 --> 05:31.592
- I think it's a very
interesting and ambitious idea.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.071
- Okay.
- But some of us--

05:33.115 --> 05:35.552
and this is not just me--
we're a little worried

05:35.596 --> 05:39.164
that it might be
somewhat impossible to make.

05:39.208 --> 05:42.124
- Sadie, do you know
what my job is as CEO?

05:42.167 --> 05:45.170
- Your job?
It's a lot of thing, isn't it?

05:45.214 --> 05:47.999
- It's pushing people
to do the impossible.

05:48.043 --> 05:51.742
Steve Jobs didn't know
how to program a computer.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.396
Okay?
But he had a vision.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.180
And he never took no
for an answer.

05:55.224 --> 05:58.488
Kennedy said, "We would make it
to the moon within the decade."

05:58.532 --> 06:01.012
No one thought
that was possible,

06:01.056 --> 06:04.320
but we did it because we had
a leader that said we could.

06:04.364 --> 06:05.669
- Wow.

06:05.713 --> 06:07.845
I bet that was
really inspiring for you.

06:07.889 --> 06:09.847
- Well, it was 1962,
so I wasn't born yet.

06:09.891 --> 06:11.893
How old do you think I am?
- You look young.

06:11.936 --> 06:13.851
[chuckles] I thought maybe
you'd had worked on.

06:13.895 --> 06:15.418
Not that you look like
you've had to have done--

06:15.462 --> 06:16.724
- Do you want to bail
out of this?

06:16.767 --> 06:18.116
- Yeah.
- Great. Okay.

06:18.160 --> 06:20.031
The point is that this is
how innovation happens.

06:20.075 --> 06:21.293
One person has an idea,

06:21.337 --> 06:23.078
everyone around them
thinks it's a mistake,

06:23.121 --> 06:25.515
but without those mistakes,
we would never reach the moon.

06:25.559 --> 06:27.691
Does that make sense?
- Yeah.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.693
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that actually does.

06:29.737 --> 06:31.565
- Good. So you're on board?
- I am.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.610
I am actually on board.
Let's do this.

06:33.654 --> 06:36.047
Should we do like a chant
or something.

06:36.091 --> 06:39.311
No, I'm just gonna go.
[chuckles]

06:39.355 --> 06:40.443
Good chat.

06:43.315 --> 06:43.490
.

06:43.533 --> 06:45.274
- [sighs] Morning.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.058
- Morning.
What are you doing here?

06:47.102 --> 06:48.886
- Katherine asked me to come.
- Oh, yeah.

06:48.930 --> 06:51.149
I figured it would be good
to get his opinion on the car,

06:51.193 --> 06:53.325
since he most closely
represents our target buyer.

06:53.369 --> 06:55.153
- 'Cause I'm poor?
- Uh, oh, no.

06:55.197 --> 06:56.241
- 'Cause I'm Black?
- No.

06:56.285 --> 06:57.721
'Cause you're poor--your words.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.201
Cyrus, proceed.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.551
- All right,
I spent all night with my guys,

07:01.595 --> 07:04.902
but so far, we've managed
to find another $800 in saving.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.295
- Really?

07:06.338 --> 07:08.036
But just yesterday
you were saying

07:08.079 --> 07:09.646
you couldn't find
one dollar to cut.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.692
Guess you just needed to be
pushed a little bit, huh?

07:11.735 --> 07:13.041
- Yep. Guess so.

07:13.084 --> 07:15.478
At any rate,
we took a prototype of the Pika

07:15.522 --> 07:17.132
and roughed in some
of the sacrifices

07:17.175 --> 07:19.351
we'd have to make so you
could get a sense of it.

07:19.395 --> 07:20.527
- Perfect.

07:20.570 --> 07:22.137
- But I have to warn you,
it's not pretty.

07:22.180 --> 07:23.834
- Oh, it's not that bad.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.880
I mean, it's ugly, but what do
you expect for 10 grand, right?

07:25.923 --> 07:27.708
- Oh, no, that's
the Palermo C50.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.013
- It's a $90,000 car.

07:29.057 --> 07:30.972
Voted best midsize
luxury sedan.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.060
- Huh.
- Yep.

07:32.103 --> 07:34.541
That's the Pika.

07:34.584 --> 07:36.891
- Yeah. [laughs]
That's interesting.

07:36.934 --> 07:39.502
- Interesting--took the words
right out of my mouth.

07:39.546 --> 07:42.549
- Yeah, it's--you know,
it's smaller than I expected.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.898
- But that would make it

07:43.941 --> 07:45.508
more fuel efficient,
though, right?

07:45.552 --> 07:47.510
- Actually, with the engine
we were forced to use,

07:47.554 --> 07:50.948
it'll get maybe 18 MPG,
like a Hummer.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.733
- Hummers sold well.

07:52.776 --> 07:54.082
People love them.
[chuckles]

07:54.125 --> 07:55.387
- If you hate it,
Katherine,

07:55.431 --> 07:57.564
we can always go back
to the original,

07:57.607 --> 07:59.566
still overwhelmingly
affordable version.

07:59.609 --> 08:01.176
- I don't know.
What do you think Jack?

08:01.219 --> 08:03.091
Is this something
that you would buy?

08:03.134 --> 08:04.701
- Well, you know...

08:04.745 --> 08:08.400
I guess I'd say if I only had
$10,000 to spend

08:08.444 --> 08:10.620
and I need to buy a car and
I was not willing to buy used,

08:10.664 --> 08:12.970
then this right here
would be an option

08:13.014 --> 08:15.451
that would be
one of my options.

08:15.495 --> 08:16.583
- Okay, great.
Good, Good.

08:16.626 --> 08:18.410
Well, that's encouraging.
I like that.

08:18.454 --> 08:20.282
- You want to take it
for a test-drive,

08:20.325 --> 08:21.979
get the full Pika experience?

08:22.023 --> 08:24.634
- Uh, is it sa--uh, is it safe?

08:24.678 --> 08:25.809
- Ish.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.332
- [barking]
- Okay.

08:27.376 --> 08:30.988
Sorry, sorry. He's just, uh--
he's just excited.

08:31.032 --> 08:33.164
It's dog for "how you doing?"

08:33.208 --> 08:35.689
- "Shall not be liable
for any injury, death,

08:35.732 --> 08:39.344
or damage caused by dog,
including loss of body parts."

08:39.388 --> 08:41.216
Like he gonna take off
my titty or something?

08:41.259 --> 08:42.870
- It's just a standard
liability release.

08:42.913 --> 08:45.916
If you just, uh--if you could
just initial on the bottom.

08:45.960 --> 08:47.483
So sorry.
- Okay, I'm gonna--

08:47.527 --> 08:49.616
- He just wants to give you
a kiss with is teeth, so...

08:49.659 --> 08:51.443
Great. Okay, fantastic.
Thank you.

08:51.487 --> 08:54.142
And, uh, here is your money.

08:54.185 --> 08:55.622
- Thank you.
- Cash, as requested.

08:55.665 --> 08:58.233
Uh, keep him away from children
and tiny adults.

08:58.276 --> 09:00.191
He's quite blind.
He can't tell the difference.

09:00.235 --> 09:01.628
All right. Great.

09:01.671 --> 09:03.325
- All right, Clarence,
all right.

09:03.368 --> 09:06.589
- [barking viciously]
- Okay. Nope. All right.

09:06.633 --> 09:10.071
[engine rumbling loudly]
- It's a little loud.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.333
- What?

09:11.376 --> 09:12.943
- Loud! It's a bit loud!

09:12.987 --> 09:16.294
- We had to cheap out on the
muffler, the suspension, too!

09:16.338 --> 09:17.600
That's why it's so bumpy!

09:17.644 --> 09:20.429
- You can really feel
the road, though!

09:20.472 --> 09:22.083
Yeah!

09:22.126 --> 09:23.867
- How's the drive?

09:23.911 --> 09:27.001
- Kind of feels like
I'm driving through jelly!

09:27.044 --> 09:28.524
- Is that a good thing?

09:28.568 --> 09:31.658
- I guess, if you like jelly!

09:31.701 --> 09:33.355
- [whispering]
Hey, what happened to you?

09:33.398 --> 09:35.009
Yesterday you're gonna tell her
how bad an idea this was.

09:35.052 --> 09:36.532
Now you're its cheerleader.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.229
- [whispering] She made some
really good points.

09:38.273 --> 09:39.404
- What points?

09:39.448 --> 09:41.189
- What if Steve Jobs
had listened

09:41.232 --> 09:43.017
when people told him
something was impossible.

09:43.060 --> 09:44.279
- Like when his doctor

09:44.322 --> 09:45.976
said you can't cure cancer
with fruit juice?

09:46.020 --> 09:47.935
- No.
[groans] Just--

09:47.978 --> 09:50.285
Look, she was
a very successful

09:50.328 --> 09:52.548
CEO of a very
successful company.

09:52.592 --> 09:54.158
So, if she thinks
this is a good idea,

09:54.202 --> 09:56.291
maybe you should try
and support her.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.858
- Okay, so nobody panic,

09:57.901 --> 10:01.644
but I've been trying to brake
for, like, 20 seconds now!

10:01.688 --> 10:03.820
- Okay, it's like
when you crank a radio

10:03.864 --> 10:05.387
and it charges the battery.

10:05.430 --> 10:06.693
So the tires rotate.

10:06.736 --> 10:09.304
That generates energy,
which powers the engine.

10:09.347 --> 10:12.307
That propels the car,
that rotates the tires,

10:12.350 --> 10:14.439
that generates more energy
and on and on,

10:14.483 --> 10:18.661
in perpetuli...lullity.

10:18.705 --> 10:22.709
Goes on forever.
Wouldn't that work?

10:22.752 --> 10:25.059
- My God.
- What?

10:25.102 --> 10:26.495
- You did it.

10:26.538 --> 10:28.236
The brightest minds in history
couldn't crack it,

10:28.279 --> 10:29.846
and Wesley Payne did it
in a day?

10:29.890 --> 10:32.806
- [chuckles]
- This will upend the industry.

10:32.849 --> 10:35.809
Okay? No more petrol,
no more--no more fossil fuels.

10:35.852 --> 10:38.463
- I got the idea--
I saw one of those desk toys

10:38.507 --> 10:39.943
with the clacky balls
and then...

10:39.987 --> 10:41.075
[imitates explosion]
- Yeah.

10:41.118 --> 10:42.250
- Yeah.

10:42.293 --> 10:43.904
- But you know he's
gonna hate this?

10:43.947 --> 10:45.906
The Saudis.
- [gasps]

10:45.949 --> 10:47.734
The Saudis. Yikes.

10:47.777 --> 10:50.345
- Why "yikes, the Saudis"?
- Well, think about it.

10:50.388 --> 10:52.564
They're about to lose
$200 billion worth

10:52.608 --> 10:54.654
of oil revenue every year, just
down the toilet because of you.

10:54.697 --> 10:56.917
- Yeah, but what are
they gonna do--assassinate you?

10:56.960 --> 10:59.354
- Oh, come on, we all
came up with this together.

10:59.397 --> 11:00.747
This was a team effort.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.270
- We had nothing
to do with this, okay?

11:02.313 --> 11:03.445
We're not taking
any of the rap

11:03.488 --> 11:05.490
for any of your--your--
your genius.

11:05.534 --> 11:07.144
- Genius.

11:07.188 --> 11:09.233
- Okay, real funny, dicks.

11:09.277 --> 11:10.626
[laughs mockingly]

11:10.670 --> 11:12.454
- You might--
you should hold on to those.

11:12.497 --> 11:13.890
Your mum might want to put them
on the fridge.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.153
- Well, what about alchemy?
You know, lead into gold?

11:16.197 --> 11:18.460
I'm sure you could
crack that one, Wes.

11:18.503 --> 11:21.637
- Hey, you wanted to see me?
- Oh, yeah. Yeah.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.508
Uh, what do you think
of the slate?

11:23.552 --> 11:25.162
Better than the blue?
- I really like the slate.

11:25.206 --> 11:26.598
- Yeah, I'm leaning
towards the blue.

11:26.642 --> 11:28.078
- Blue would have my vote.
- Yeah, cool.

11:28.122 --> 11:29.471
Thank you. Yeah.

11:29.514 --> 11:31.603
By the way, how are you
feeling about the car?

11:31.647 --> 11:33.170
- The Pika?
- Yeah.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.477
- Uh, great.
It's--it's really exciting.

11:35.520 --> 11:37.479
- Good, yeah, because,
you know, things are a little--

11:37.522 --> 11:39.655
obviously a little rough
at the moment.

11:39.699 --> 11:41.178
- Yeah.
But that--that's normal.

11:41.222 --> 11:42.527
- Yes.
Yeah, that is normal.

11:42.571 --> 11:43.833
- Yeah.
- That is normal.

11:43.877 --> 11:45.574
I was gonna say that,
actually, yeah.

11:45.617 --> 11:48.664
So--so just to confirm,

11:48.708 --> 11:51.145
you--you have
zero reservations, though?

11:51.188 --> 11:55.410
- I mean, I do worry a bit
if there's a market for it,

11:55.453 --> 11:57.499
especially
with the low fuel economy,

11:57.542 --> 12:00.502
which means higher gas costs,
plus, aesthetically--

12:00.545 --> 12:02.809
- It's a disaster, isn't it?
- What?

12:02.852 --> 12:04.636
- [scoffs]
I mean, I don't know--

12:04.680 --> 12:06.377
I don't know anything
about cars,

12:06.421 --> 12:08.510
but this--this seems like
a really big mistake.

12:08.553 --> 12:09.859
- But like you said,
without mistakes,

12:09.903 --> 12:11.513
we would have never
made it to the moon.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.080
- Who the [bleep]
wants to go to the moon?

12:13.123 --> 12:14.516
You know
what would be different

12:14.559 --> 12:15.822
if we didn't go to the moon?
Nothing.

12:15.865 --> 12:17.562
Not one thing
in this whole world

12:17.606 --> 12:19.477
would be any different
than it is right now.

12:19.521 --> 12:21.697
- Okay, well--
- Why didn't you tell me

12:21.741 --> 12:23.786
what an incredibly bad idea
this was?

12:23.830 --> 12:26.571
- I tried.
You told me to believe in you.

12:26.615 --> 12:29.009
- Believe in me within reason.

12:29.052 --> 12:30.445
I thought that was implied.

12:30.488 --> 12:33.404
You know what?
I need to be able to trust you,

12:33.448 --> 12:35.972
even if that means
telling me the hard truths.

12:36.016 --> 12:37.191
Can you do that?

12:37.234 --> 12:39.193
- Yes.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.673
Sorry.
I will try to be better.

12:41.717 --> 12:43.414
- Thank you.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.203
- You know, I think
the blue is tacky

12:49.246 --> 12:51.858
and that the gray carpet
is way better.

12:51.901 --> 12:54.686
- Wow. Okay, I don't know
if you're just lashing out

12:54.730 --> 12:56.558
because you are hurt
that I just yelled at you

12:56.601 --> 13:00.823
or if that is what you really
believe, but either way...

13:00.867 --> 13:02.433
wow.

13:04.348 --> 13:06.829
You've got anger issues.

13:11.007 --> 13:11.225
.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.705
- So let's be honest, guys,
the $10,000 version

13:13.749 --> 13:15.446
of the Pika is terrible.
- Oof, harsh, dude.

13:15.490 --> 13:17.361
- I said we couldn't make one
for that cheap

13:17.405 --> 13:19.320
but I was told I wasn't allowed
to use the C word.

13:19.363 --> 13:20.930
- You're right.
It's my fault.

13:20.974 --> 13:22.845
From now on, we can all use
the C word.

13:22.889 --> 13:24.020
- Seriously? Cool.

13:24.064 --> 13:25.848
Do you guys know Janine
in Logistics?

13:25.892 --> 13:27.197
- Okay, here's the problem.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.286
We have to pitch this thing
to the board later.

13:29.330 --> 13:30.461
If they greenlight this,

13:30.505 --> 13:32.028
we actually have to make
this turd-mobile.

13:32.072 --> 13:33.464
- So we cancel the pitch.

13:33.508 --> 13:34.988
- No, I already
announced it publicly.

13:35.031 --> 13:36.032
I can't just turn around
and be like,

13:36.076 --> 13:37.425
"Yeah, I changed my mind.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.209
You know what?
I'm an indecisive lady."

13:39.253 --> 13:41.081
- Uh, yeah, I wouldn't
say it like that.

13:41.124 --> 13:42.560
- Okay, here's what
we got to do, guys--

13:42.604 --> 13:43.866
we got to tank the pitch.

13:43.910 --> 13:46.042
- Okay, so you want to make
the car look bad.

13:46.086 --> 13:48.088
- Yeah, but not
so bad that I look stupid

13:48.131 --> 13:49.741
for having thought
it was a good idea before.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.134
- Mm-hmm.
- It's not your fault.

13:51.178 --> 13:52.832
It was Cyrus's crappy design.

13:52.875 --> 13:54.877
- Is this just because I shot
down your perpetual-motion car?

13:54.921 --> 13:56.748
- [inhales sharply]
No.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.229
- So we need it
to look good enough

13:59.273 --> 14:01.275
that they don't think
it's bad,

14:01.318 --> 14:03.320
but bad enough that
they don't think it's good.

14:03.364 --> 14:05.105
- Exactly.
That is the sweet spot.

14:05.148 --> 14:07.063
- Dinner at mine tonight?
[chuckles]

14:07.107 --> 14:09.109
The dog?
No, he--he won't be there.

14:09.152 --> 14:10.545
Yeah, hit by a car.
Obviously terrible.

14:10.588 --> 14:14.375
So I, uh--
I won't be, um--I won't be--

14:14.418 --> 14:16.943
Sorry, one second.

14:16.986 --> 14:18.074
What the [bleep]?

14:18.118 --> 14:20.816
You're selling my dog?

14:20.860 --> 14:22.470
- No, I'm flipping your dog.

14:22.513 --> 14:23.993
- What?

14:24.037 --> 14:26.256
- I'm flipping him--you know,
how they do with houses.

14:26.300 --> 14:29.390
I took your ugly,
broke-down dog, fixed it up,

14:29.433 --> 14:31.696
took some nice pictures,
and relisted it on the market?

14:31.740 --> 14:34.003
- Well--well,
you can't do that,

14:34.047 --> 14:36.310
because I paid you
to take the dog, all right?

14:36.353 --> 14:38.051
And for you to then turn around
and sell the dog

14:38.094 --> 14:39.922
and make more money, well,
that's just--it's--

14:39.966 --> 14:41.619
- Smart marketing.

14:41.663 --> 14:43.099
- Look, I could have sold
the dog myself, okay?

14:43.143 --> 14:44.492
If I was comfortable lying

14:44.535 --> 14:47.321
about his many behavioral
issues, all right?

14:47.364 --> 14:49.236
Which I notice you've not
mentioned on here, yeah?

14:49.279 --> 14:50.933
Ever heard
of a duty to disclose?

14:50.977 --> 14:52.804
- It's illegal not to put that
on the flyer?

14:52.848 --> 14:54.415
- I mean,
I-I will have to check

14:54.458 --> 14:57.200
the specific Michigan case law,
but it's unethical.

14:57.244 --> 15:00.812
- Well, I'm feeling
okay about it.

15:00.856 --> 15:03.293
- Hey, why doesn't it work?

15:03.337 --> 15:06.340
- Wesley, I'm busy.
- Just explain it to me.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.951
- Fine. The electricity
produced by the tires

15:08.995 --> 15:10.126
will be less than it takes

15:10.170 --> 15:11.519
to push them
an equivalent distance.

15:11.562 --> 15:13.825
It's why we can't end
global warming

15:13.869 --> 15:15.653
by running air conditioners
outside.

15:15.697 --> 15:18.656
The heat generated would
outweigh the cooling effects.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.136
- Even if we use solar.

15:20.180 --> 15:21.964
- [scoffs] I mean, obviously,
that would be better.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.835
But think about
how much electricity

15:23.879 --> 15:25.054
you'd have to generate.

15:25.098 --> 15:26.316
- But if it was solar,
the hotter the day,

15:26.360 --> 15:27.709
the more electricity
we'd have, right?

15:27.752 --> 15:29.363
- Hey--
[chuckles]

15:29.406 --> 15:31.931
Becau--See--

15:31.974 --> 15:33.410
[chuckles]

15:33.454 --> 15:35.456
I--

15:35.499 --> 15:37.110
There's a reason.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.853
- Oh, hey, Dori,
which blazer says

15:41.897 --> 15:44.334
"I like her, but I don't want
to buy what she's selling"?

15:44.378 --> 15:47.163
- On the left.
- Great, oh, perfect.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.817
- Uh, "Car and Driver"
is running a story tomorrow

15:48.860 --> 15:50.427
about the 10k Pika.

15:50.471 --> 15:52.342
They sent an advance copy if
you want to take a look at it.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.909
- Oh, God.
Ask them to hold off.

15:53.953 --> 15:55.998
With any luck, this whole thing
will be dead by tomorrow.

15:56.042 --> 15:58.522
- Too bad.
It's pretty flattering.

15:58.566 --> 16:00.698
- Really?

16:00.742 --> 16:02.483
What picture are they using?

16:02.526 --> 16:04.006
So listen to this.

16:04.050 --> 16:07.183
"In 1908, Henry Ford
introduced the Model T,

16:07.227 --> 16:09.707
"the first car affordable
to the working class.

16:09.751 --> 16:11.622
"114 years later,

16:11.666 --> 16:14.625
Katherine Hastings is poised
to follow his lead."

16:14.669 --> 16:16.366
- Wow.
- Huh.

16:16.410 --> 16:19.239
- And then look
at this section.

16:19.282 --> 16:21.763
- "The Pika will likely be
the first car for many teens,

16:21.806 --> 16:23.025
"who, as they age,

16:23.069 --> 16:25.114
"they return to Payne
for higher-end fare.

16:25.158 --> 16:27.334
"If Payne can maintain
that brand loyalty

16:27.377 --> 16:30.990
Gen Z may have to be renamed
Gen P."

16:31.033 --> 16:32.208
- Gen P.

16:32.252 --> 16:33.557
I mean, is it possible

16:33.601 --> 16:35.385
that we were too quick
to turn on the Pika?

16:35.429 --> 16:37.518
I mean, if we pull
this thing off,

16:37.561 --> 16:38.693
I-I think it may be good.

16:38.736 --> 16:40.173
I-I--Do you guys think
it might be good?

16:40.216 --> 16:41.826
I mean, be honest.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.611
- Are we seriously gonna change
our whole strategy, though,

16:43.654 --> 16:45.221
just based on
one magazine article?

16:45.265 --> 16:46.918
- I mean, they call me
a visionary?

16:46.962 --> 16:48.224
- No, of course, of course.

16:48.268 --> 16:50.139
And it is
a very respected publication.

16:50.183 --> 16:54.013
- All right, guys, let's sell
the crap out of this car.

16:55.797 --> 16:57.581
- [clears throat]
- [groans]

16:59.670 --> 16:59.888
.

16:59.931 --> 17:02.151
- "If you always do
what you've always done,

17:02.195 --> 17:04.414
you'll always get
what you've always got."

17:04.458 --> 17:05.894
Henry Ford.

17:05.937 --> 17:08.897
Henry, who I've been
compared to on occasion,

17:08.940 --> 17:12.727
understood the importance
of affordability.

17:12.770 --> 17:15.730
And that is why I am so excited
to present to you

17:15.773 --> 17:18.602
the newly revised Pika 10k.

17:21.301 --> 17:23.651
This car is...

17:23.694 --> 17:25.609
a real beaut.

17:25.653 --> 17:28.786
[chuckles] I mean, eh,
not really on the outside.

17:28.830 --> 17:30.571
I mean, on the outside,
it's more of a--

17:30.614 --> 17:32.747
more just
sort of an average car.

17:32.790 --> 17:35.750
[chuckles]
But it's inside--inside--

17:35.793 --> 17:37.665
Inside is where
the magic happens.

17:37.708 --> 17:40.059
[laughs]
Oh.

17:40.102 --> 17:43.584
You know, it's, uh,
unconventional-looking,

17:43.627 --> 17:45.586
but I think it charms you.

17:45.629 --> 17:48.589
It's just like, um,
Steve "Buskemi" on wheels.

17:48.632 --> 17:50.112
Is it "Buskemi"? Buscemi?

17:50.156 --> 17:52.419
- I think he had it--
"Buskemi," like bruschetta.

17:52.462 --> 17:53.898
- Right.
Well, doesn't matter.

17:53.942 --> 17:56.771
Anyway, uh, why don't you
take a moment with these?

17:56.814 --> 17:59.730
And, Sadie, could I please
have a word?

17:59.774 --> 18:02.168
- Yeah.
- Great.

18:02.211 --> 18:03.299
Those graphics are horrible.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.779
I thought we're gonna
spiff them up.

18:04.822 --> 18:06.607
- We did.
Those are the airbrushed ones.

18:06.650 --> 18:08.435
- So those are better
than the actual car?

18:08.478 --> 18:10.611
How much better?
- That's tough.

18:10.654 --> 18:13.266
So subjective.
Four times better?

18:13.309 --> 18:14.789
- See now I'm starting to think
that I was right

18:14.832 --> 18:16.225
when I said
we shouldn't do this.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.966
Is the car good or bad?

18:18.009 --> 18:21.361
- I-I do not know
what you want me to say.

18:21.404 --> 18:23.319
- I want your honest opinion.

18:23.363 --> 18:25.278
- Do you? Do you really?
- Yes.

18:25.321 --> 18:28.281
- Okay, fine. If I was
being chased by wolves

18:28.324 --> 18:31.066
and my only means of escape
was to drive that to safety,

18:31.110 --> 18:33.155
well, okay,
I would take the car,

18:33.199 --> 18:38.073
but it would suck
because that car sucks.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.292
- Thank you.

18:39.335 --> 18:42.121
See? How hard was that?

18:42.164 --> 18:44.471
All right, let's go flush
this turd down the toilet

18:44.514 --> 18:45.733
once and for all.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.651
- I want Clarence back.
I'll buy him back.

18:50.694 --> 18:52.261
I'll go to the nearest ATM.
What was it, $600?

18:52.305 --> 18:54.524
- No, so we actually ran

18:54.568 --> 18:57.266
into a competitive-bidding
situation,

18:57.310 --> 18:58.746
and it's up to $725.

18:58.789 --> 19:02.489
Now, you're more than welcome
to bid $750 or $1,000.

19:02.532 --> 19:05.231
That's our "Buy It Now" option.
I'll give him straight to you.

19:06.710 --> 19:08.321
- You are
a terrible human being.

19:08.364 --> 19:09.322
- Come on, Elliot.

19:09.365 --> 19:10.758
Okay, for an extra 50,

19:10.801 --> 19:13.413
I'll throw in the muzzle
and the chew toys and stuff.

19:13.456 --> 19:15.197
- So you have the specs.

19:15.241 --> 19:16.894
I wish the numbers
were more impressive,

19:16.938 --> 19:19.680
but they are what they are,
and this is how it looks.

19:19.723 --> 19:21.377
So you either like it,
or you don't.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.292
- Katherine, it sounds like
you're underselling the car.

19:23.336 --> 19:25.338
Is this a project
you believe in or not?

19:25.381 --> 19:27.862
- Oh, no, I mean,
I could never pitch something

19:27.905 --> 19:28.950
that I don't believe in.

19:28.993 --> 19:31.039
I-I just want to be up front

19:31.082 --> 19:33.128
about what you're getting,
you know, so...

19:33.172 --> 19:34.782
This is a big swing,
and with big swings,

19:34.825 --> 19:37.524
you get big misses, like,
nine times out of ten, so...

19:37.567 --> 19:39.090
- I'm a bit skeptical.

19:39.134 --> 19:41.876
The numbers are poor, and,
no offense, but it's ugly.

19:41.919 --> 19:43.486
- Oh, no, I respect that.

19:43.530 --> 19:46.576
I mean, honestly, but if this
one doesn't work out,

19:46.620 --> 19:48.230
hey, we'll get them
on the next one.

19:48.274 --> 19:49.884
That's what I think.

19:49.927 --> 19:51.799
- Mark, we brought Katherine
in for a fresh perspective.

19:51.842 --> 19:54.062
If she believes in this,
I say we back her up.

19:54.105 --> 19:56.456
- I have a right
to an opinion, Helen.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.067
- Honestly, Helen, Mark does
have the right to his opinion.

19:59.110 --> 20:00.677
- Sure. It just so happens
that when an idea

20:00.721 --> 20:03.245
comes from a woman,
his opinion is that it's bad.

20:03.289 --> 20:05.421
- Oh, God. Here we go
with the woman stuff.

20:05.465 --> 20:06.683
- Can we discussed
this in private?

20:06.727 --> 20:07.989
- I think private's better.

20:08.032 --> 20:09.643
- Fine, let's do
the stupid car

20:09.686 --> 20:11.253
if it's that important to you.
- Mark, don't gaslight her.

20:11.297 --> 20:12.428
- Bill, that's not
what that means.

20:12.472 --> 20:14.038
- I haven't done
a lot of these.

20:14.082 --> 20:15.475
Is this how it usually goes?
- Ah, some better, some worse.

20:15.518 --> 20:16.911
- That's the problem.

20:16.954 --> 20:18.260
- You need to check
your privilege, Helen.

20:18.304 --> 20:19.566
- You check
your privilege, Mark.

20:19.609 --> 20:21.132
- So then this idiot says,

20:21.176 --> 20:23.091
"Couldn't we stop global
warming if we all just had

20:23.134 --> 20:24.614
solar-powered
air conditioners?"

20:24.658 --> 20:27.313
And I was, like, trying
to explain how dumb that was,

20:27.356 --> 20:29.402
because, like, why--

20:29.445 --> 20:31.621
how--what would you--

20:31.665 --> 20:34.276
If you were explaining,
what would you--

20:34.320 --> 20:37.410
what would you say to--
[chuckles]

20:37.453 --> 20:40.151
Why wouldn't that work?

20:40.195 --> 20:42.371
Right?

20:45.809 --> 20:47.071
- [knocks on glass]
Hey.

20:47.115 --> 20:50.118
- Oh, hey. Hear the news?
Greenlight.

20:50.161 --> 20:51.119
- Mm, I heard.

20:51.162 --> 20:53.077
So congratulations?
- Yeah.

20:53.121 --> 20:54.296
Maybe it'll be a good thing.

20:54.340 --> 20:55.950
I mean, it's a risk,
but it could be good.

20:55.993 --> 20:57.604
You think it'll be good?
- Yeah.

20:57.647 --> 20:59.432
- Yeah, good.
- Yeah, I do, yeah.

20:59.475 --> 21:00.520
- Okay. I'll walk you out.

21:00.563 --> 21:02.304
Ooh...

21:02.348 --> 21:03.958
final call...

21:04.001 --> 21:06.047
Slate, right?
- That's what I'd do.

21:06.090 --> 21:08.615
- Yeah. Yeah.
Slate it is.

21:08.658 --> 21:12.140
- Cool.
[both chuckle]

21:16.623 --> 21:19.147
- Wait one second.
