00:00.438 --> 00:03.012
Previously on AMC's "The Son"...

00:03.015 --> 00:05.609
Ride to the Garcia
Ranch and get some help.

00:05.611 --> 00:08.412
- What is it?
- You rode through an oil seep.

00:08.414 --> 00:10.581
Something's changed in you, Pete.

00:10.583 --> 00:12.349
We can't live like this.

00:12.351 --> 00:14.279
Are you happy here in the city?

00:14.282 --> 00:16.219
Then you and the kids should stay.

00:16.222 --> 00:18.231
My husband didn't die.

00:18.234 --> 00:21.825
It's a lie I told everyone,
but I don't want to lie to you.

00:21.827 --> 00:24.171
I'll come to your teepee tonight.

00:25.431 --> 00:27.464
Damn. Look at 'em all.

00:27.466 --> 00:29.533
Aah!

00:31.000 --> 00:37.074

00:40.846 --> 00:43.914
I didn't mean for that to happen.

00:43.950 --> 00:46.584
That's not why I came over.

00:46.619 --> 00:48.485
I didn't think that.

00:48.521 --> 00:49.486
I need to go.

00:49.522 --> 00:51.221
No, hey.

00:54.060 --> 00:56.860
Stay.

00:56.896 --> 00:59.930
I have no business being here, Peter.

01:03.069 --> 01:04.902
You're married.

01:04.937 --> 01:07.338
Sally and I are over.

01:07.373 --> 01:09.273
There's nothing left between us.

01:11.644 --> 01:13.544
I've heard this kind of talk before.

01:13.579 --> 01:17.047
I mean it. Th... This is different.

01:17.083 --> 01:19.750
I promise.

01:19.785 --> 01:21.852
Stay.

01:21.887 --> 01:24.788
Here? In your house?

01:24.824 --> 01:27.691
I gave the help the day off.

01:27.727 --> 01:30.361
I'm not sneaking around like we used to.

01:30.396 --> 01:32.129
I'm just too old for it.

01:32.164 --> 01:34.031
Just have dinner with me.

01:34.066 --> 01:35.899
- Let me explain.
- Explain what?

01:35.935 --> 01:39.303
Anything. Anything you need explained.

04:30.078 --> 04:31.578
So, I told him,

04:31.613 --> 04:34.080
"Amigo, if you want me
to put my finger there,

04:34.115 --> 04:35.915
you'll need to put a ring on it first."

04:37.085 --> 04:38.685
What'd he say to that?

04:38.720 --> 04:41.054
He turned bright red and
offered to pay me double.

04:41.089 --> 04:43.022
Well done, my girl.

04:43.058 --> 04:44.691
So, did you take the money?

04:44.726 --> 04:47.927
What do you think? Call and raise.

04:47.963 --> 04:50.697
Good afternoon, my soiled doves.

04:50.732 --> 04:51.965
Afternoon, Mama.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.466
Anybody feel like a bit of travel?

04:53.501 --> 04:55.735
No more Aggie parties.

04:55.770 --> 04:57.337
Them college boys wouldn't know gratuity

04:57.339 --> 04:58.805
if it bit them on the pecker.

04:58.840 --> 05:01.407
No, this is a highborn affair...

05:01.443 --> 05:04.444
One of Thaddeus Kilborne's Honey Hunts.

05:04.479 --> 05:07.213
Walltowall ranchers and oil men,

05:07.248 --> 05:10.717
Patillo Higgins, the
Chapmans, Bill Sterling.

05:10.752 --> 05:14.921
And rumor has it that Colonel
Eli McCullough, himself,

05:14.956 --> 05:16.489
is gonna put in an appearance.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.291
Well, ladida.

05:18.326 --> 05:21.661
Kilborne put the word out
to all the boarding houses.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.129
Anybody interested?

05:24.766 --> 05:26.265
I'll go.

05:26.301 --> 05:27.934
Lena's in. Anybody else?

05:27.969 --> 05:29.302
No, thank you.

05:29.337 --> 05:31.471
Last time I got my ass bit by chiggers.

05:32.941 --> 05:34.474
Anybody?

05:34.509 --> 05:36.943
Come on, gals.

05:36.978 --> 05:39.245
You might catch yourself a rich husband.

05:39.280 --> 05:41.180
Or he might catch
Lena's social blisters.

05:42.717 --> 05:45.184
He'd be a lucky fella
if that's all he gets.

06:01.369 --> 06:03.870
There you go, Miguel.
You know what to do.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.104
Thank you.

06:05.140 --> 06:07.140
Finn!

06:07.175 --> 06:09.842
Good to see ya, boy!
Glad you could make it.

06:09.878 --> 06:12.478
Wouldn't miss it.
It's quite a setup here.

06:12.514 --> 06:14.681
Well, it is that.

06:14.716 --> 06:18.317
Kilborne's daddy was
a property speculator.

06:18.353 --> 06:20.787
Made all his money selling
bad lots to settlers.

06:20.822 --> 06:22.221
What was wrong with them?

06:22.257 --> 06:24.290
Well, it just happened
it was smack in the middle

06:24.325 --> 06:25.525
of Comanche territory.

06:25.560 --> 06:27.060
Hold still, Miguel.

06:27.095 --> 06:28.394
It looks like history's
forgotten the details.

06:28.396 --> 06:29.729
- Don't jerk.
- Well, it always does.

06:29.731 --> 06:31.064
It's a nice spread, though, isn't it?

06:31.066 --> 06:33.066
Stop shaking, damn it.

06:33.101 --> 06:34.500
May I?

06:34.536 --> 06:35.835
Colonel McCullough?

06:35.870 --> 06:37.370
Of course. Be my guest.

06:46.247 --> 06:48.214
That was a hell of a shot!

06:48.249 --> 06:49.882
Colonel?

06:49.918 --> 06:51.417
That's my bow.

06:51.453 --> 06:52.685
Indeed it is.

06:52.721 --> 06:54.987
- Have you eaten?
- Nah, famished.

06:55.023 --> 06:58.758
Good. You're just in time for lunch.

07:02.964 --> 07:04.397
Colonel!

07:06.468 --> 07:09.035
Judge Thaddeus Kilborne.

07:09.070 --> 07:11.370
A laudable affair
you've put together here.

07:11.406 --> 07:13.039
My pleasure.

07:13.074 --> 07:16.375
Is this your boy I heard
so much about? Pete?

07:16.411 --> 07:18.911
I'm the other one. Phineas.

07:18.947 --> 07:21.080
- It's a pleasure, Your Honor.
- Call me Thaddeus.

07:21.116 --> 07:23.282
I do hope you plan to stick around

07:23.318 --> 07:24.817
for the Honey Hunt tonight.

07:25.649 --> 07:27.420
- Well...
- Wouldn't miss it for the world.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.590
His brother's married,
but this one here,

07:30.625 --> 07:32.225
he's a legendary cocksman.

07:33.461 --> 07:35.695
Well, my daddy exaggerates my exploits.

07:35.730 --> 07:37.797
Attaboy. Admit to nothing.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.733
- Colonel.
- Thaddeus.

07:43.102 --> 07:44.502
I suppose that was necessary.

07:45.673 --> 07:48.708
Better safe than sorry.

07:48.743 --> 07:51.210
Not that I don't love the
drunk assholes of San Antone,

07:51.246 --> 07:53.579
but why did you call me here?

07:53.615 --> 07:55.648
Misery loves company.

07:55.683 --> 07:58.117
No, really. Why'd you call?

07:58.153 --> 08:01.053
I found an oil seep.

08:01.089 --> 08:03.790
Had it tested.

08:03.825 --> 08:05.324
Sweet crude.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.730
So, what's the problem?

08:10.765 --> 08:13.499
It's on Pedro García's land.

08:16.771 --> 08:18.137
Does he know?

08:18.173 --> 08:20.873
Well, I thought it best
to keep it under my hat.

08:23.030 --> 08:24.430
All right, well, what's the plan?

08:26.214 --> 08:28.281
Same thing the McKinneys did.

08:28.316 --> 08:30.249
Same thing everybody does.

08:30.285 --> 08:31.784
Thank you.

08:31.820 --> 08:35.121
Yeah, but Pedro's not some
illiterate dirt farmer.

08:35.155 --> 08:36.489
He'll contest it, and he'll win.

08:36.524 --> 08:38.524
Not if he's gone.

08:42.230 --> 08:44.330
I'm trying to figure out
what you're suggesting here.

08:44.365 --> 08:46.332
Well, that's Pedro's problem.

08:46.367 --> 08:48.434
I'm hoping he'll be reasonable.

08:48.469 --> 08:50.169
About as reasonable as you'd be

08:50.205 --> 08:52.772
if someone were trying to
chisel you out of your land?

08:52.807 --> 08:54.907
Do you think we have a choice here?

08:56.845 --> 08:59.812
When does the rest of that
money from Midkiff run out?

09:01.516 --> 09:02.782
Christmas...

09:02.817 --> 09:04.483
- if we're careful.
- In the meantime,

09:04.519 --> 09:06.986
we're still waiting for
that new rig to arrive.

09:07.021 --> 09:08.521
And once it does show up,

09:08.556 --> 09:10.723
how long is it gonna take us to hit oil?

09:10.758 --> 09:13.793
Months? Years?

09:13.828 --> 09:17.997
We're building something
here, Finn, you and me...

09:18.032 --> 09:19.699
A legacy.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.167
You know that, right?

09:21.202 --> 09:23.302
The future we want...

09:24.772 --> 09:27.073
the future we're working toward...

09:29.110 --> 09:31.177
it won't happen unless
we make it happen.

09:31.212 --> 09:34.881
And that García land...
It's a sure thing.

09:39.087 --> 09:40.586
All right, then.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.323
What do we do about Pete?

09:44.359 --> 09:45.488
Keep him out of it.

09:45.528 --> 09:47.829
- He'll find out soon enough.
- Well, not that soon.

09:47.832 --> 09:51.230
I sent him up to Austin.

09:54.435 --> 09:56.335
What?

09:56.371 --> 09:58.704
He and Sally had a big fight.

09:58.740 --> 10:01.407
He'll be back at the ranch by now.

10:01.442 --> 10:03.743
Shit.

10:03.778 --> 10:06.679
We can talk to him.

10:06.714 --> 10:08.281
You think so?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.682
The last time I checked,

10:09.717 --> 10:12.351
Maria García was still
a member of that family.

10:12.387 --> 10:14.587
Well, that all happened a long time ago.

10:14.622 --> 10:17.623
Well, your brother doesn't
let things go that easy.

10:19.394 --> 10:21.494
Keep him in the dark.

10:31.806 --> 10:34.473
What happened with Sally?

10:34.509 --> 10:38.077
She's gonna stay in the
city, where she's happy.

10:38.112 --> 10:39.912
It's where she belongs.

10:39.948 --> 10:42.281
And is that what you both want?

10:42.317 --> 10:43.816
Yeah.

10:46.321 --> 10:49.055
So you're gonna stay here alone?

10:49.090 --> 10:52.825
I figure, so long as we
can hang onto this place.

10:52.860 --> 10:55.294
What about your kids?

10:57.532 --> 10:59.298
Want some wine?

11:02.437 --> 11:04.637
All our wine glasses got shot up,

11:04.672 --> 11:06.505
so we'll have to make do with these.

11:23.057 --> 11:24.924
I don't know how I'll survive

11:24.959 --> 11:26.692
without seeing the kids every day.

11:29.397 --> 11:32.665
Truth is, they're
better off in the city...

11:34.335 --> 11:36.769
and safer.

12:09.237 --> 12:12.338
It's different with Eli.

14:37.164 --> 14:38.397
Your Honor?

14:38.432 --> 14:40.132
Might I trouble you for a moment?

14:40.167 --> 14:42.134
Well, sure thing, son.

14:42.169 --> 14:44.003
Do you think this little soiree has been

14:44.038 --> 14:45.504
a resounding success, or what?

14:45.539 --> 14:47.740
I thank you for that.

14:53.759 --> 14:56.727
So, you got any aces
in that basket there?

14:56.770 --> 14:59.237
Well, you'll have to have a look.

15:02.890 --> 15:04.390
Well, now.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.692
It's a gift from the Colonel.

15:06.727 --> 15:08.894
What does he need this time?

15:08.929 --> 15:10.362
Well, Your Honor...

15:10.398 --> 15:12.331
there are a few records in your office

15:12.366 --> 15:13.732
we would like to have altered.

15:13.768 --> 15:14.833
I'm listening.

15:14.869 --> 15:17.870
The García tract.

15:17.905 --> 15:20.706
Pedro hasn't paid his
taxes in 10 years now,

15:20.741 --> 15:23.609
and the penalties have
added up substantially.

15:23.644 --> 15:27.346
In fact, it's probably
time for a sheriff's sale.

15:27.381 --> 15:29.081
Hell.

15:29.116 --> 15:33.185
I'm sure glad you're not my neighbor.

15:33.220 --> 15:34.920
How much is in there?

15:34.955 --> 15:36.622
$5,000.

15:40.161 --> 15:44.430
Pedro García has always
paid his taxes on time.

15:44.465 --> 15:45.697
We know that.

15:45.733 --> 15:47.966
He'll have records and receipts,

15:48.002 --> 15:50.202
but I guess you know that, too.

15:50.237 --> 15:51.237
We do, sir.

15:53.641 --> 15:56.408
We are rotten, aren't we?

15:56.444 --> 15:59.211
I mean, how much does one man need?

15:59.246 --> 16:02.581
II got a piece of land
here the size of Delaware,

16:02.616 --> 16:04.416
but I see a pile of money,

16:04.452 --> 16:07.019
I can't stop myself from picking it up.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.656
I'll take that as a "yes."

16:10.691 --> 16:14.593
Let's make this payment the first half,

16:14.628 --> 16:17.830
rest due upon completion
of the task?

16:17.865 --> 16:19.998
Yes, sir.

16:20.034 --> 16:22.034
Boy.

16:25.439 --> 16:27.106
Thank you.

16:27.141 --> 16:29.108
So...

16:29.143 --> 16:31.610
were you serious before?

16:31.645 --> 16:33.679
I get to ask whatever I want?

16:33.714 --> 16:36.115
Sure.

16:36.150 --> 16:38.283
Have there been other women?

16:38.319 --> 16:41.186
Besides me?

16:41.222 --> 16:43.489
Not once I got married, no.

16:43.524 --> 16:45.357
What about before?

16:45.392 --> 16:46.758
I was a kid.

16:46.794 --> 16:49.094
I know. I remember.

16:49.130 --> 16:51.396
But I couldn't have been your first.

16:53.634 --> 16:55.434
My father took us to a whorehouse

16:55.469 --> 16:57.136
when I was 14 in Mexico.

16:57.171 --> 17:00.272
Did you like it?

17:00.307 --> 17:01.874
I was a 14yearold
boy in a whorehouse.

17:01.909 --> 17:05.210
What do you think?

17:05.246 --> 17:06.712
And then I met you.

17:09.849 --> 17:12.151
And?

17:12.185 --> 17:14.853
No "and."

17:14.888 --> 17:19.391
You were my girlfriend. I was faithful.

17:19.425 --> 17:22.961
Until you got married.

17:22.997 --> 17:25.364
Yeah.

17:25.398 --> 17:28.634
Then I got married.

17:28.669 --> 17:31.403
Why did it mean so much to your father?

17:36.043 --> 17:38.810
Why Sally?

17:38.846 --> 17:42.247
He liked that her
family was respectable.

17:44.685 --> 17:46.418
I don't understand it.

17:46.453 --> 17:48.554
Me neither.

17:48.589 --> 17:51.156
You want me to ask him for you?

17:51.192 --> 17:52.424
No.

17:54.428 --> 17:56.228
What about you?

17:58.599 --> 18:00.899
Well...

18:00.935 --> 18:03.735
you were my first.

18:03.771 --> 18:07.406
But then I moved to New York, and...

18:07.441 --> 18:08.974
there were others.

18:10.644 --> 18:13.278
Too big a number for a lady.

18:18.152 --> 18:19.685
When I was younger,

18:19.720 --> 18:24.656
I always... wondered why
I didn't get pregnant.

18:27.245 --> 18:29.835
I watched all of my friends
dealing with it all the time.

18:29.854 --> 18:32.764
But...

18:32.792 --> 18:36.493
then I just realized maybe
I couldn't get pregnant.

18:41.075 --> 18:42.975
Maybe I can't.

18:46.914 --> 18:48.914
Does that bother you?

18:48.949 --> 18:50.949
Not at all.

19:05.966 --> 19:08.233
Why don't you want to get married?

19:08.269 --> 19:11.190
I want to choose.

19:13.841 --> 19:16.408
You want freedom...

19:16.443 --> 19:19.011
and yet you own a slave.

19:19.046 --> 19:20.512
I find that funny.

19:20.547 --> 19:22.359
Nobody asked you to be here.

19:22.398 --> 19:24.783
If you wanted to be free,
you should have stayed

19:24.785 --> 19:26.852
where the white people come from.

19:31.125 --> 19:32.891
Eli is probably there right now.

19:35.029 --> 19:38.030
I hope he's sleeping in
a big feather bed tonight,

19:38.065 --> 19:39.931
two pillows under his head.

19:39.967 --> 19:42.134
What's a "feather bed"?

19:42.169 --> 19:43.702
Heaven.

19:43.737 --> 19:45.604
I don't understand.

19:45.639 --> 19:46.838
No!

19:46.874 --> 19:48.640
Of course you don't.

19:48.676 --> 19:50.842
'Cause you're just a disgusting savage.

19:50.878 --> 19:53.612
Go on. You can hit me for
saying that if you want.

19:53.647 --> 19:56.181
It's okay. I know it
makes you feel strong.

19:58.218 --> 20:00.766
It's the only power
you have left, isn't it?

20:05.492 --> 20:08.293
You and me, we are not so different.

20:08.329 --> 20:10.495
I've been a slave for a while now,

20:10.531 --> 20:12.597
and I've learned a few tricks.

20:15.336 --> 20:17.969
When your new husband is
putting his baby in you,

20:18.005 --> 20:21.707
it might help you to think of
a happy memory from your past.

20:22.843 --> 20:26.345
Maybe that would be a good
time for you to remember Eli.

21:31.578 --> 21:34.780
So, what happened with your husband?

21:37.117 --> 21:41.686
Henry left me... when I
couldn't give him a baby.

21:45.759 --> 21:48.994
But it's okay. He wasn't a good man.

21:51.265 --> 21:53.165
I was stuck.

21:53.200 --> 21:55.400
You know that?

21:55.436 --> 21:58.336
We were living in a tenement
in Greenwich Village.

21:58.372 --> 22:01.873
We shared a bathroom
with the whole floor.

22:04.344 --> 22:08.180
I had to pawn my wedding
ring to get a ticket home.

22:10.117 --> 22:12.818
You could've contacted
me. I would've helped you.

22:12.853 --> 22:14.319
Really?

22:14.354 --> 22:17.189
You would have wired me money?

22:17.224 --> 22:18.757
Behind Sally's back?

22:18.792 --> 22:20.058
I would've done something
to help you, Maria.

22:20.060 --> 22:21.869
Come on. You have to know that.

22:23.063 --> 22:24.963
I thought we were gonna get married.

22:26.299 --> 22:29.835
And then you left me...
for a woman you just met.

22:29.870 --> 22:33.271
It was awful for me, too.
I missed you all the time.

22:35.042 --> 22:38.944
I hated my father putting
me in that position.

22:38.979 --> 22:40.378
Yeah.

22:40.414 --> 22:43.348
I'm sure you suffered.

22:46.153 --> 22:48.553
You had a life.

22:48.589 --> 22:50.655
You could do whatever you wanted.

22:50.691 --> 22:52.691
I don't have any of your choices.

22:52.726 --> 22:55.660
I have no money, no skills,
no way to survive on my own.

22:55.696 --> 22:57.796
Do you not understand that?

23:08.108 --> 23:10.041
You're right.

23:10.077 --> 23:13.011
I haven't been fair to you.

23:13.046 --> 23:14.913
I wish I could take that time back,

23:14.948 --> 23:16.915
do it all different.

23:20.053 --> 23:22.354
Well, you can't.

23:22.389 --> 23:25.156
No, I can't.

23:25.192 --> 23:26.892
I'm sorry.

23:29.530 --> 23:31.563
I'm sorry.

24:08.753 --> 24:11.287
Are you here to shoot quail?!

24:11.322 --> 24:12.621
- No! No!
- No! No!

24:12.623 --> 24:13.856
Are you here to hunt duck?

24:13.891 --> 24:15.124
- No! No!
- No! No!

24:15.126 --> 24:16.692
God damn right, you're not.

24:16.728 --> 24:19.762
It is with enormous
pleasure that I welcome y'all

24:19.797 --> 24:23.766
to Thaddeus Kilborne's
Third Annual Honey Hunt!

24:26.437 --> 24:27.803
Now, each of these fine ladies

24:27.839 --> 24:30.272
has a basket with a bottle of bourbon...

24:30.308 --> 24:32.375
- Yeah!
- A pecan pie...

24:32.410 --> 24:34.143
- Yeah!
- And a blanket...

24:34.178 --> 24:37.313
so you don't get burrs on your trousers.

24:39.150 --> 24:41.650
We'll let these ladies
get a little head start,

24:41.686 --> 24:44.220
and then we'll start huntin'!

24:46.591 --> 24:49.191
That's right, we can't make
it too difficult for them.

24:51.095 --> 24:54.263
You speak to Thaddeus?

24:54.298 --> 24:55.431
Yeah.

24:55.466 --> 24:58.334
How'd it go?

24:58.369 --> 24:59.935
Easiest meeting of my life.

25:03.374 --> 25:05.908
Second thoughts?

25:05.943 --> 25:08.511
It is what it is.

25:13.551 --> 25:15.684
- Well, given the situation...
- Yeah.

25:15.720 --> 25:18.354
- We should split up.
- Probably for the best.

25:48.319 --> 25:51.887
Where you going? Come back here!

25:53.724 --> 25:56.492
Well, well!

25:56.527 --> 25:59.195
Lucky you.

26:01.098 --> 26:02.598
Hi.

26:04.922 --> 26:06.422
Wanna sit?

26:08.339 --> 26:09.972
That's a lovely invitation,

26:10.007 --> 26:12.408
but I think you'd prefer
one of the other gentlemen

26:12.443 --> 26:13.676
who's about to come this way.

26:13.711 --> 26:16.245
I don't know.

26:16.280 --> 26:19.748
You look pretty handsome to me.

26:21.352 --> 26:25.020
And what happened to your wedding ring?

26:25.056 --> 26:27.923
You lose track of it?

26:27.959 --> 26:31.327
Tragically, I have not yet
met the right young lady.

26:31.362 --> 26:34.497
Maybe that's about to change.

26:34.532 --> 26:38.100
We're not stepping off this blanket

26:38.135 --> 26:41.036
until I make you forget...

26:41.072 --> 26:42.738
every...

26:42.773 --> 26:46.408
woman you've ever been with.

26:46.444 --> 26:48.944
Your ambition does you credit, ma'am.

26:50.715 --> 26:53.782
You like this?

26:53.818 --> 26:56.719
Who doesn't like kisses?
They are very pleasant.

26:56.754 --> 26:59.021
How 'bout this?

26:59.056 --> 27:01.223
That is...

27:01.259 --> 27:03.259
That's very kind of you.

27:06.497 --> 27:11.467
Well... how 'bout this?

27:11.502 --> 27:14.436
You just relax...

27:14.472 --> 27:16.939
and pretend I'm someone else.

27:42.967 --> 27:45.134
You are Colonel Eli McCullough, right?

27:45.169 --> 27:48.270
Guilty as charged.

28:00.318 --> 28:03.319
I don't speak Comanche.

28:03.354 --> 28:05.487
But you knew enough to recognize it.

28:05.523 --> 28:07.056
Who are your people?

28:08.859 --> 28:11.627
Not Comanche.

28:11.662 --> 28:13.596
But I think you might know them.

28:15.833 --> 28:17.967
What's this about, honey?

28:18.002 --> 28:20.636
There's easier ways to get money off me.

28:20.671 --> 28:23.105
I'm not here for money.

28:23.140 --> 28:25.374
I'm Lipan Apache.

28:32.049 --> 28:34.450
From Mexico.

28:34.485 --> 28:36.852
Near Villa Union?

28:37.555 --> 28:39.955
You and your men came into my village.

28:39.991 --> 28:42.191
You killed everyone you could find,

28:42.226 --> 28:44.994
except my father.

28:45.029 --> 28:47.162
You know what's funny,

28:47.198 --> 28:49.365
is I wasn't even sure
you would remember.

28:49.400 --> 28:52.067
I remember him well.

28:52.103 --> 28:55.371
That was a long time ago.

28:55.413 --> 28:58.080
I was a different man then.

28:58.109 --> 29:02.211
And your father and his
people killed my wife and son.

29:03.280 --> 29:07.282
An entire village for
your wife and son?!

29:11.188 --> 29:13.022
That war's long over.

29:13.057 --> 29:14.657
Come and sit down.

29:14.692 --> 29:17.259
We have more in common than you think.

29:17.294 --> 29:18.394
Stop.

29:20.798 --> 29:22.031
Tell me your name.

29:24.468 --> 29:26.301
Eli?!

29:44.081 --> 29:45.881
God.

30:13.077 --> 30:16.478
Help.

30:16.513 --> 30:18.280
Help!

30:18.315 --> 30:20.816
I've been shot!

31:20.911 --> 31:22.811
Can't hold them all.

31:28.085 --> 31:30.719
Can you even count all
the lives you've ended?

31:40.097 --> 31:42.097
What's happening here?

31:44.067 --> 31:46.835
Are you a message from The Great Spirit?

31:46.870 --> 31:49.337
That Apache gal...

31:49.373 --> 31:52.140
Pretty sure that was a message.

31:52.176 --> 31:54.009
She just wanted me dead.

31:54.044 --> 31:56.278
That's a hell of a message.

31:58.782 --> 32:02.384
Get on the horse.

32:09.960 --> 32:12.761
I'm not ready.

32:12.796 --> 32:16.164
You're a loaded gun, old man.

32:16.200 --> 32:19.367
It's a better world without you in it.

32:27.578 --> 32:29.611
Easy there.

32:34.418 --> 32:36.952
Come on. We'll do it together.

33:02.186 --> 33:04.053
Can you hear me?

33:04.081 --> 33:05.647
Don't look back.

33:06.917 --> 33:08.617
Hang on. Hang on, Daddy.

33:08.652 --> 33:10.014
Don't look back.

33:10.017 --> 33:12.420
Hold on, Daddy. We're gonna
get you to a doctor, okay?

33:15.959 --> 33:18.393
Hang on, Daddy! I gotcha!

33:18.428 --> 33:22.297
Daddy?! Hold on. We're gonna
get you to a doctor, okay?

33:22.332 --> 33:24.599
Okay, but tell us, you
gotta tell me what happened.

33:24.635 --> 33:26.401
I'm fine.

33:26.436 --> 33:28.603
Well, who did this?! Tell
me! Who did this to you?!

33:33.010 --> 33:35.510
I don't know. I didn't see the fella.

33:35.545 --> 33:38.947
Well, he shot you in the chest!
How did you miss seeing him?!

33:38.982 --> 33:40.682
It was dark!

33:40.717 --> 33:43.018
Okay, shh, shh, shh, shh.

33:43.053 --> 33:46.621
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. All
right. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

33:46.657 --> 33:48.156
Don't just stand there!

33:48.191 --> 33:50.592
Come on! Go get some
help! Get a truck started!

33:50.627 --> 33:52.327
We gotta get him outta here!

36:43.467 --> 36:45.266
It'll be light soon.

36:45.302 --> 36:46.700
Shh.

36:50.507 --> 36:53.341
I gotta go.

36:53.376 --> 36:55.610
No.

36:55.645 --> 36:59.380
I'll have to invent some story.

36:59.416 --> 37:00.849
I'll have to tell them

37:00.884 --> 37:03.218
that I spent the night
at a friend's house.

37:03.253 --> 37:04.786
You're a grown woman.

37:04.821 --> 37:07.689
I'm still their daughter.

37:07.724 --> 37:09.357
Hell with that.

37:11.695 --> 37:14.095
Get your things. Come on.

37:17.453 --> 37:19.053
What?

37:19.056 --> 37:21.202
You don't want anyone telling
you what to do anymore,

37:21.204 --> 37:23.571
how to live your life...

37:23.607 --> 37:25.840
so come on, let's go.

37:30.213 --> 37:31.980
You're joking.

37:32.015 --> 37:34.215
We got some money in the safe upstairs.

37:34.251 --> 37:37.886
We'll head up to Montana.
I'll get work there as a hand.

37:37.921 --> 37:39.254
- Let's leave right now.
- No.

37:39.289 --> 37:41.589
- Never come back.
- Do... Don't.

37:44.394 --> 37:47.028
You can't say that to me.

37:48.765 --> 37:50.031
It's not fair.

37:50.066 --> 37:51.599
I love you.

38:00.043 --> 38:03.711
I'm not running off
with a married man, Pete.

38:03.747 --> 38:05.647
So put that out of your head.

38:12.322 --> 38:14.622
Okay.

38:14.658 --> 38:17.258
So, what are we gonna do?

38:36.246 --> 38:37.846
Who is it?

38:37.881 --> 38:41.082
Pedro García.

38:41.117 --> 38:43.418
It's not locked. Come on in.

38:47.090 --> 38:49.557
How are you, amigo?

38:51.061 --> 38:52.727
Can I get you something?

38:52.762 --> 38:54.863
I can make a pot of coffee.

38:54.898 --> 38:57.098
No.

38:57.133 --> 38:59.133
I won't stay long.

39:01.137 --> 39:04.172
Maria was out all night.

39:05.966 --> 39:09.068
I believe she was here.

39:09.103 --> 39:11.937
I'm a married man, Pedro.

39:11.972 --> 39:14.640
Whatever you think is going
on, I believe you're mistaken.

39:16.444 --> 39:18.210
My daughter...

39:18.245 --> 39:19.978
she's a widow.

39:20.014 --> 39:22.581
She's sick with grief

39:22.616 --> 39:26.819
and not responsible for her actions.

39:26.854 --> 39:30.723
A man who takes advantage of this...

39:30.758 --> 39:34.326
is not a man at all.

39:34.362 --> 39:36.562
I'm not taking advantage of her.

39:36.597 --> 39:37.796
You really believe that?

39:37.832 --> 39:40.032
With all my heart.

39:45.039 --> 39:46.772
When I knocked on your door today,

39:46.807 --> 39:48.774
I left my pistol in my car.

39:48.809 --> 39:52.544
Next time I come, it will be in my hand.

41:40.437 --> 41:42.037
Hey, what's the verdict, Doc?

41:42.072 --> 41:44.039
Got all the fluid out of his lungs,

41:44.074 --> 41:46.909
but if he moves around too much,
his lung will collapse again,

41:46.944 --> 41:48.877
and it'll probably kill him.

41:48.913 --> 41:51.246
