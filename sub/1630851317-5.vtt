WEBVTT

00:02.567 --> 00:03.568
<i>Dele,</i>

00:03.612 --> 00:05.005
tell me about school.

00:05.048 --> 00:06.310
How did you do
on your algebra test?

00:06.354 --> 00:08.051
I got an A-plus,
same as my science quiz.

00:08.095 --> 00:09.922
And did you do
your literature homework?

00:09.966 --> 00:12.186
There was none.
I did a book report anyway.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.753
My teacher was confused
but gave me an "A."

00:14.797 --> 00:16.407
Good.

00:16.451 --> 00:18.844
And how are all
your international classmates?

00:18.888 --> 00:20.846
What have I always told you
about getting along

00:20.890 --> 00:22.500
with kids
of different backgrounds?

00:22.544 --> 00:24.372
Befriend them, surpass them

00:24.415 --> 00:26.330
and make them wish
they were Nigerian.

00:26.374 --> 00:28.071
Don't worry, Mum.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.246
I'm doing fine.

00:29.290 --> 00:30.856
- Okay.
- How are you?

00:30.900 --> 00:33.033
How did you do
on your MCAT practice test?

00:33.076 --> 00:35.252
Ugh, I didn't have a chance
to take it yet.

00:35.296 --> 00:36.862
I thought
you were doing it last week.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.777
Yes, but work was very busy

00:38.821 --> 00:41.171
and then Bob wanted to take me
to see a movie.

00:41.215 --> 00:43.782
Uh-uh. A movie?

00:43.826 --> 00:45.958
Yes. It was date night.

00:46.002 --> 00:48.439
Mum, your studies
should always come before

00:48.483 --> 00:50.050
dating and lollygagging.

00:50.093 --> 00:51.094
Yes, Dele.

00:51.138 --> 00:52.226
At this rate,

00:52.269 --> 00:53.792
I'll become a doctor before you.

00:54.967 --> 00:56.534
- Yes, Dele.
- All right.

00:56.578 --> 00:58.362
Let's go over
biochemical foundations.

00:58.406 --> 01:01.365
Ugh, I forgot my textbook
at work.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.628
Abishola Wheeler, what have
I always told you about...

01:03.672 --> 01:05.891
Dele. We are done
with the teasing.

01:05.935 --> 01:07.632
Yes, Mum.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.965
Knock-knock.

01:37.184 --> 01:38.141
Hello.

01:38.185 --> 01:39.751
Mind if we interrupt?

01:39.795 --> 01:42.319
We have something
very special for you.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.320
Okay.

01:43.364 --> 01:44.365
You should stand.

01:45.627 --> 01:47.237
We saw all the
beautiful traditions

01:47.281 --> 01:50.240
that you had
at your wedding and...

01:50.284 --> 01:52.112
we thought we'd include you
in one of ours.

01:52.155 --> 01:53.113
Aw.

01:53.156 --> 01:54.853
Gloves?

01:54.897 --> 01:57.595
My grandmother, Rosemary
Gilbert, gave a pair of gloves

01:57.639 --> 01:59.597
to each of her daughters
when they became women.

01:59.641 --> 02:00.685
And they did the same

02:00.729 --> 02:02.209
for their daughters.

02:03.166 --> 02:05.429
I was afraid Christina was
gonna be the end of the line.

02:05.473 --> 02:07.736
Thank God you came along.

02:08.824 --> 02:12.697
Anyway, Great-Grandma Gilbert
would be so proud.

02:12.741 --> 02:14.134
Oh, no, she'd hate it.

02:14.177 --> 02:15.787
She was old-school.

02:15.831 --> 02:17.441
You know, women shouldn't vote,

02:17.485 --> 02:18.834
Black people aren't people--
that sort of thing.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.184
Well, I'm glad

02:21.228 --> 02:22.707
she's not here to see this.

02:22.751 --> 02:24.318
She is, too, sweetie.

02:25.232 --> 02:26.885
"Abdow"?

02:26.929 --> 02:28.800
Oh, it's-it's
your initials.

02:28.844 --> 02:32.326
Abishola Bolatito
Doyinsola Oluwatoyin

02:32.369 --> 02:34.458
and now Wheeler.

02:34.502 --> 02:36.199
My grandmother

02:36.243 --> 02:39.202
wanted us always
to present ourselves well.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.290
- Mm.
- To make sure

02:40.334 --> 02:41.291
everybody knew

02:41.335 --> 02:43.337
we were better than them.

02:44.338 --> 02:46.296
Of course,
that's not how we feel now.

02:46.340 --> 02:47.341
Eh.

02:48.777 --> 02:49.995
Well, thank you very much.

02:50.039 --> 02:51.083
I am so honored.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.042
The honor is ours.

02:53.085 --> 02:55.566
Oh. And along with
this presentation

02:55.610 --> 02:57.829
comes another tradition.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.396
- Girls' day!
- Girls' day!

02:59.440 --> 03:01.006
Yeah. Gonna get
our makeup

03:01.050 --> 03:02.660
and hair done.
Do a little shopping,

03:02.704 --> 03:04.575
go to the spa.

03:04.619 --> 03:07.404
In my time, girls' day ended
with being paraded

03:07.448 --> 03:10.233
in front of the menfolk
at the Cherry Pie Dance.

03:10.277 --> 03:11.495
Ew.

03:11.539 --> 03:13.410
Relax, it wasn't creepy.

03:13.454 --> 03:17.066
You just had to sit on an old
man's lap and sing him a song.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.939
Well, we're still gonna get
dolled up,

03:20.983 --> 03:22.550
but we're doing it
for ourselves.

03:22.593 --> 03:25.117
Because we are bad bitches.

03:25.161 --> 03:27.119
I thought
we couldn't say that word.

03:27.163 --> 03:28.208
No, we've reclaimed it.

03:28.251 --> 03:29.252
Oh, great.

03:29.296 --> 03:30.949
Abishola, grab your stuff.

03:30.993 --> 03:33.561
Christina,
you're driving, bitch.

03:34.605 --> 03:37.086
Mom, we got to talk context.

03:50.404 --> 03:51.927
What are you doing?

03:52.841 --> 03:54.277
Dropping things on my feet.

03:54.321 --> 03:55.757
Because?

03:55.800 --> 03:57.715
I am testing the steel toes
of my new boots.

03:57.759 --> 04:00.414
Well, do not waste
company time.

04:01.415 --> 04:02.981
Do they work?

04:03.025 --> 04:04.722
So far. At lunch,

04:04.766 --> 04:06.246
Jerry's going to lend me
his bowling ball.

04:06.289 --> 04:07.551
That will be the real test.

04:07.595 --> 04:08.726
Huh.

04:08.770 --> 04:09.901
Hey, fellas.

04:09.945 --> 04:10.946
Kofo,

04:10.989 --> 04:12.643
- nice boots.
- Thank you.

04:12.687 --> 04:14.297
I made a trip to
the outlet stores.

04:14.341 --> 04:15.733
Where the discounts are crazy

04:15.777 --> 04:19.302
and everything must go...!

04:19.346 --> 04:22.262
Yeah. But it's
worse quality stuff.

04:22.305 --> 04:23.741
Is that true?

04:23.785 --> 04:25.961
Good point. I don't know.

04:26.962 --> 04:29.007
Our company
should open an outlet store.

04:29.051 --> 04:30.008
That is ridiculous.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.836
It's not a bad idea.

04:31.880 --> 04:33.795
Exactly!

04:34.535 --> 04:36.580
All the best brands
do it. And since

04:36.624 --> 04:38.582
MaxDot is
the very best brand,

04:38.626 --> 04:39.975
we should do the same.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.847
I like it. You think
you could work up a proposal?

04:42.891 --> 04:44.196
Yes, Mr. Wheeler.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.633
Great. Run with it.

04:45.676 --> 04:47.112
I will run
with it like the wind,

04:47.156 --> 04:48.113
Mr. Wheeler!

04:48.157 --> 04:49.593
Wow.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.769
Check out New Boots.

04:51.813 --> 04:53.423
I do not know
what happened.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.512
I had an idea,
I said it

04:55.556 --> 04:56.600
and he liked it.

04:56.644 --> 04:57.775
Way to go, man.

04:57.819 --> 04:59.690
Better watch out, Goodwin.

04:59.734 --> 05:01.344
Pretty soon, we'll all
be working for this guy.

05:04.260 --> 05:05.479
Over my dead body.

05:07.568 --> 05:10.310
- Ooh.
- Ooh. Thank you.

05:11.833 --> 05:13.835
This is
what I needed.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.363
I speak English.

05:20.407 --> 05:23.801
Oh. Well, and I speak
Vietnamese.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.063
Look at us.

05:25.107 --> 05:27.849
Couple of bilingual bi...

05:27.892 --> 05:29.329
people.

05:29.372 --> 05:30.460
Other hand, please.

05:30.504 --> 05:31.722
Yep.

05:33.376 --> 05:34.638
Uh, no, thank you.

05:34.682 --> 05:36.814
I don't like to drink
during the day.

05:36.858 --> 05:38.642
That's 'cause you're
not used to it.

05:38.686 --> 05:40.905
You got to work it
like a muscle.

05:40.949 --> 05:43.778
Yeah, Mom's liver
can run a marathon.

05:45.867 --> 05:46.998
Uh...

05:47.042 --> 05:49.261
Well, it's important
to exercise.

05:49.305 --> 05:50.915
There you go.

05:50.959 --> 05:52.395
You got to admit,
it's nice to get off your feet.

05:52.439 --> 05:55.398
You are always off
your feet.

05:55.442 --> 05:57.400
It's a figure
of speech.

05:57.444 --> 05:59.663
We are women
in this world.

05:59.707 --> 06:01.926
We've been on our feet
for 2,000 years.

06:01.970 --> 06:03.493
She's right.

06:03.537 --> 06:05.060
You agree with me?

06:05.103 --> 06:06.931
Every once in a while,
you back into one.

06:06.975 --> 06:08.672
I've been
raising kids

06:08.716 --> 06:11.414
and running a business
since 1973.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.373
And I've always said,

06:13.416 --> 06:15.418
if you don't take
a little me time,

06:15.462 --> 06:17.638
you'll snap
and murder your whole family.

06:18.813 --> 06:20.118
I've never heard you say that.

06:20.162 --> 06:22.251
I say it in here.

06:34.176 --> 06:36.613
Need some help there, Flo-Jo?

06:36.657 --> 06:39.224
- What?
- Nice nails.

06:39.268 --> 06:42.053
They're beautiful
but so impractical.

06:42.097 --> 06:45.317
Yeah. Wait until you clean up
your first Code Brown.

06:45.361 --> 06:48.320
I did not think about that.

06:48.364 --> 06:51.106
Uh-huh. You're gonna get
a fill-in you didn't pay for.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.326
- They are pretty, though.
- Yes, they are.

06:54.370 --> 06:56.154
And I deserve to do
something for myself.

06:56.198 --> 06:57.460
Don't we all?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.549
Yes, but I deserve it more.

06:59.593 --> 07:01.421
Is that right?

07:01.464 --> 07:04.119
Yes. I work harder than any
other nurse on this floor.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.730
I work on this floor, too.

07:06.774 --> 07:08.776
I know.

07:09.777 --> 07:11.431
All right, Freddy Krueger.

07:11.474 --> 07:15.260
Mr. Wilson in 408 needs
a catheter inserted.

07:15.304 --> 07:16.740
Good luck to you.

07:16.784 --> 07:18.133
Even better luck to him.

07:23.704 --> 07:25.270
Good morning, Mr. Wheeler.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.272
Thank you for giving me
the opportunity

07:27.316 --> 07:30.972
to present to you what I feel
is the future of our company.

07:31.015 --> 07:32.408
Impressive.

07:33.409 --> 07:34.584
What are you doing here?

07:34.628 --> 07:36.151
Watching my cousin betray me.

07:37.152 --> 07:39.197
Also, I brought you stew.

07:39.241 --> 07:41.025
- Thank you.
- So,

07:41.069 --> 07:43.375
how long have you been
planning to take my job?

07:43.419 --> 07:45.682
That's not my intention.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.467
And yet here you are,

07:47.510 --> 07:49.469
practicing the very words

07:49.512 --> 07:51.471
that will shove me
right off Sock Mountain.

07:52.428 --> 07:55.692
My success does not have to
be at the expense of yours.

07:55.736 --> 07:57.607
Perhaps we can
work together.

07:57.651 --> 07:59.304
Like the Property Brothers.

07:59.348 --> 08:02.177
Let's renovate our relationship.

08:03.091 --> 08:04.962
You actually believe
that's possible?

08:05.006 --> 08:08.313
I do. I would never do anything
to undermine you, cousin.

08:08.357 --> 08:10.185
You have done so much for me.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.883
Well, then perhaps you can
- do something for me.
- Anything.

08:12.927 --> 08:14.624
Cancel your presentation.

08:14.668 --> 08:17.235
Not that thing.

08:17.279 --> 08:18.672
Mm.

08:18.715 --> 08:20.848
You have come a long way, Kofo.

08:20.891 --> 08:23.677
It is unfortunate that this is
where your journey will end.

08:23.720 --> 08:24.765
Badly.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.595
- We shall see.
- Mm-hmm.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.162
Thank you
for the stew, cousin.

08:31.206 --> 08:32.512
You're welcome.

08:32.555 --> 08:33.513
Mmm.

08:33.556 --> 08:34.514
Delicious.

08:34.557 --> 08:35.515
What is that spice?

08:35.558 --> 08:37.386
Laxatives.

08:43.871 --> 08:46.743
Hey, girl...!

08:46.787 --> 08:49.093
Hello, girl.

08:49.137 --> 08:51.443
Oh.

08:51.487 --> 08:53.358
Yesterday was so much fun.

08:53.402 --> 08:54.838
- It was.
- You know,

08:54.882 --> 08:56.231
we should do it again.

08:56.274 --> 08:58.059
Without Mom. Right?

08:58.102 --> 09:00.365
Or whatever you prefer.

09:00.409 --> 09:01.758
But I would prefer
without Mom.

09:01.802 --> 09:03.760
Christina, I'm trying to study.

09:03.804 --> 09:05.283
Oh. Sorry.

09:05.327 --> 09:07.024
Yeah, you study.

09:07.068 --> 09:09.592
I'll just do my thang.

09:09.636 --> 09:11.202
What is that?

09:11.246 --> 09:12.595
Oh, it's just a fun way
to say "thing."

09:12.639 --> 09:13.596
Oh.

09:13.640 --> 09:14.728
Okay.

09:14.771 --> 09:16.425
Do your thang.

09:35.444 --> 09:37.925
Boy, them bubbles are loud.

09:45.280 --> 09:47.151
That was me.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.631
It's an article
on women in medicine.

09:48.675 --> 09:50.415
I-It's right up your alley.

09:50.459 --> 09:52.940
Thank you.
I'll read it later.

09:56.944 --> 09:58.728
Me again. Sorry.

09:58.772 --> 10:00.077
It's a
gluten-free

10:00.121 --> 10:02.253
- cinnamon roll.
- Oh. A recipe?

10:02.297 --> 10:04.691
Just a picture.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.478
Ah.

10:09.521 --> 10:10.740
It does look good.

10:10.784 --> 10:12.176
I did not

10:12.220 --> 10:13.613
eat breakfast.

10:13.656 --> 10:15.658
Well, no wonder you can't focus.

10:15.702 --> 10:17.617
I know a great brunch spot.

10:17.660 --> 10:18.748
I should really study.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
But it's brunch.

10:20.794 --> 10:22.665
That's breakfast and lunch.

10:22.709 --> 10:25.015
It's two meals in one.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.843
You're actually saving time.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.368
Okay. Maybe a little break,
just to eat.

10:30.412 --> 10:31.935
Yes. Exactly.

10:31.979 --> 10:34.111
Just a little break.

10:34.155 --> 10:35.635
And, you know,

10:35.678 --> 10:37.375
maybe, afterwards,

10:37.419 --> 10:39.029
we can recharge
with a little shopping.

10:39.073 --> 10:40.030
No.

10:40.074 --> 10:41.771
No little shopping.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.338
Got it.

10:43.381 --> 10:45.209
No shopping.

10:45.253 --> 10:46.950
Just brunch.

11:38.132 --> 11:39.350
You should not
have allowed me

11:39.394 --> 11:41.004
to drink like that.

11:41.048 --> 11:43.180
- Honey, I wasn't there.
- Please, do not argue with me.

11:43.224 --> 11:45.226
I'm not-- Okay.

11:46.227 --> 11:48.533
Here, drink this
down. It'll help.

11:48.577 --> 11:50.013
- What is it?
- You don't want to know.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.406
And don't smell it, either.

11:55.932 --> 11:58.282
Just choke the rest of that
down and then sleep it off.

11:58.326 --> 12:00.850
I cannot sleep it off.
I have work to do.

12:00.894 --> 12:03.026
I was supposed to take
another practice test.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.767
What am I going to tell Dele?

12:04.811 --> 12:07.422
Tell him you're a human
being that makes mistakes.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.164
I will never tell him that.

12:11.165 --> 12:12.862
I should've seen this coming.

12:12.906 --> 12:15.778
What?
That I would become a wino?

12:15.822 --> 12:17.737
You're not a wino.

12:17.780 --> 12:19.390
You're just stressed.

12:19.434 --> 12:21.218
You left Dele in Nigeria,

12:21.262 --> 12:22.872
we got married, you moved in,

12:22.916 --> 12:25.135
you're studying to be a doctor.

12:25.179 --> 12:26.920
That's a lot on
someone's plate.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.660
It was only a matter
of time before you...

12:30.706 --> 12:33.491
That's exactly what my head
feels like.

12:33.535 --> 12:35.319
I'm never going to drink again.

12:35.363 --> 12:36.756
Aw, come on.

12:36.799 --> 12:39.062
At least cut loose
once a year,

12:39.106 --> 12:40.237
just so I can
take care of you.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.239
Nurse Bob.

12:43.501 --> 12:44.981
- Oh, no, I smelt it.
- Stay here!

12:45.025 --> 12:46.330
I'll get the trash can.

12:49.551 --> 12:51.335
Thank you
for the ride, Douglas.

12:51.379 --> 12:52.597
No problem.

12:52.641 --> 12:54.295
Flat tires suck.

12:54.338 --> 12:56.427
Lucky I was driving
- by your place.
- It is.

12:56.471 --> 12:58.995
Do you mind if we stop by
a doughnut shop?

12:59.039 --> 13:01.781
They are for the meeting
with Mr. Wheeler.

13:01.824 --> 13:03.608
Trying to get in good
with the boss. Smart.

13:03.652 --> 13:04.827
Oh, no.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.134
They are for torpedoing
my cousin.

13:08.396 --> 13:10.790
No matter what Kofo says
in his presentation,

13:10.833 --> 13:12.530
all Mr. Wheeler
will be thinking

13:12.574 --> 13:14.837
is when can he have
a Boston cream.

13:14.881 --> 13:16.186
His favorite.

13:16.230 --> 13:18.188
Yes!

13:18.232 --> 13:20.277
At a certain point,

13:20.321 --> 13:23.454
I will slide the box over
to Mr. Wheeler.

13:23.498 --> 13:25.717
As we leave, he will say,

13:25.761 --> 13:27.023
"Great job, Goodwin"

13:27.067 --> 13:28.851
and pat me
on the shoulder,

13:28.895 --> 13:31.375
leaving a greasy badge
of honor.

13:31.419 --> 13:34.204
You got it all figured out.

13:34.248 --> 13:35.553
Kofo may have good ideas,

13:35.597 --> 13:37.294
but challenging me
was not one of them.

13:37.338 --> 13:38.992
If Kofo wanted to beat you,

13:39.035 --> 13:40.645
he'd have to plan
three steps ahead.

13:40.689 --> 13:41.864
Impossible.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.823
He cannot even plan
his next meal.

13:44.911 --> 13:46.738
Yeah, to get one
over on you,

13:46.782 --> 13:49.132
he'd have to...
wake up early,

13:49.176 --> 13:51.134
let air out of your tire,

13:51.178 --> 13:54.137
recruit someone to drive you
out to the middle of nowhere.

13:54.181 --> 13:55.835
Someone who's spent a lifetime

13:55.878 --> 13:58.011
in the shadow
of an older relative.

14:00.274 --> 14:02.058
Douglas.

14:02.102 --> 14:04.278
This is not the way
to doughnuts.

14:05.453 --> 14:06.715
No, Goodwin.

14:07.629 --> 14:09.065
No, it is not.

14:12.634 --> 14:14.592
Hey. Is Goodwin
gonna join us?

14:14.636 --> 14:15.898
He had car trouble.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.595
Did he call you?

14:17.639 --> 14:18.901
No.

14:18.945 --> 14:21.164
But I know he had car trouble.

14:21.208 --> 14:23.514
Perhaps we
should just start.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.081
I know you are a very busy man.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.910
Ooh, Boston cream.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.564
Uh-uh.

14:41.054 --> 14:42.882
I've missed this.

14:42.925 --> 14:44.622
What, the cold, hard seats?

14:44.666 --> 14:46.537
Or the smell of B.O.
and egg salad?

14:47.974 --> 14:49.714
I'm talking about riding
the bus with you.

14:49.758 --> 14:51.891
I've missed it, too.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.936
These days, I have
to talk to myself.

14:53.980 --> 14:56.243
Which is good, because it stops
people from sitting next to me.

14:57.679 --> 14:59.811
I think I'm going
to do this more often.

14:59.855 --> 15:02.205
You know? Get back
to simpler times.

15:02.249 --> 15:04.033
What does that mean?

15:04.077 --> 15:05.643
You know,
the way things were.

15:05.687 --> 15:08.646
No fancy nails, no mimosas.

15:08.690 --> 15:11.823
Just people working and striving
to make their lives better,

15:11.867 --> 15:14.348
day in and day out.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.960
Why are you talking
like a senator?

15:18.004 --> 15:19.657
I'm reconnecting.

15:19.701 --> 15:21.398
With your simple friend.

15:21.442 --> 15:22.747
Kemi.

15:22.791 --> 15:23.923
Oh, I understand.

15:23.966 --> 15:25.228
You want to come visit me,

15:25.272 --> 15:27.230
like a living museum
of your past.

15:27.274 --> 15:28.928
"Oh, back when Kemi
and I were friends,

15:28.971 --> 15:31.495
milk was ten
cents a gallon."

15:31.539 --> 15:32.844
You are being ridiculous.

15:32.888 --> 15:35.935
We poor people often are.

15:35.978 --> 15:37.893
- Maybe we should stop talking.
- Maybe we should.

15:41.984 --> 15:44.987
I really missed
these fights.

15:45.031 --> 15:46.075
Me, too.

15:50.123 --> 15:52.864
Look, Tunde,
the future doctor

15:52.908 --> 15:54.997
- has made a house call.
- Ah.

15:55.041 --> 15:56.607
My beautiful niece.

15:56.651 --> 15:58.609
Uncle, it's so good
- to see you.
- Mm.

15:58.653 --> 16:00.176
-<i>E kaale,</i> Auntie.
- Ah.

16:00.220 --> 16:01.656
<i>Kaale,</i> Morenike.

16:01.699 --> 16:03.179
The food smells
delicious.
Thank you.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.181
Since your cousin
has moved in,

16:05.225 --> 16:07.270
we have been eating like kings.

16:07.314 --> 16:08.793
Thank you, Uncle.

16:08.837 --> 16:09.969
But when you lived here,

16:10.012 --> 16:12.014
we also enjoyed your cooking.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.102
Yes.

16:13.146 --> 16:15.322
But now we eat like kings.

16:17.672 --> 16:19.717
- May I help with the royal feast?
- Oh, no.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.502
You are a guest.

16:21.545 --> 16:23.721
And we do not want you
to ruin those beautiful nails.

16:23.765 --> 16:26.986
Oh. It's okay. I was going
to trim them tomorrow anyway.

16:27.029 --> 16:28.291
Ah. Let me help
- with that.
- Not the paper towels!

16:31.164 --> 16:32.556
What?

16:32.600 --> 16:34.036
I was told
we do not waste paper towels

16:34.080 --> 16:35.646
for every little spill.

16:35.690 --> 16:38.867
That is why God made
leftover Wendy's napkins.

16:38.910 --> 16:40.477
Oh. I-I'm sorry. I forgot.

16:40.521 --> 16:41.652
Of course you did.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.220
You are a fancy lady now.

16:44.264 --> 16:46.005
Pay attention,
Morenike.

16:46.048 --> 16:48.224
If you follow
in Abishola's footsteps,

16:48.268 --> 16:51.706
one day,
you will be just as wasteful.

16:52.881 --> 16:55.231
I certainly hope so.

16:55.275 --> 16:58.060
I will buy you another roll.

16:58.104 --> 17:00.323
Throwing money
at the problem.

17:00.367 --> 17:04.023
We are so proud
of the person you have become.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.032
Uh...

17:13.075 --> 17:15.512
what is this extra charge
on your debit card?

17:15.556 --> 17:17.862
Oh, uh, I had to buy a snack
at school.

17:17.906 --> 17:19.038
I skipped breakfast.

17:19.081 --> 17:20.952
Never skip breakfast.

17:20.996 --> 17:22.345
- Yes, Mum.
- Skipping breakfast

17:24.739 --> 17:26.045
brunch.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.048
Doesn't that save time?

17:29.091 --> 17:30.440
Breakfast and lunch together?

17:30.484 --> 17:32.442
That is what they
want you to think.

17:32.486 --> 17:34.879
Next thing you know,
you are in Bloomingdale's

17:34.923 --> 17:38.361
buying an expensive coat that
does not even keep you warm!

17:38.405 --> 17:40.842
Is that what you want
for your life?

17:42.235 --> 17:43.540
- No?
- No!

17:43.584 --> 17:44.541
It is not.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.108
Stay focused, Dele.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.458
Do not lose track
of what is important.

17:48.502 --> 17:49.894
Okay, Mum.

17:49.938 --> 17:52.071
So, do you want to study?

17:52.114 --> 17:54.812
Oh. I would, but I have
a previous engagement.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.814
Didn't you
hear me honking?

17:56.858 --> 17:59.252
It's mimosa time, bitch!

18:00.644 --> 18:01.819
What did she say?

18:01.863 --> 18:03.430
Nothing. Remember, no brunch.

18:04.344 --> 18:06.128
- No brunch?
- Ah.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.304
For the boy.
He cannot handle it.

18:08.348 --> 18:09.305
Let's go.

18:09.349 --> 18:11.351
Mm-hmm.
