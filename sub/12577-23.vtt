HERE'S $300 CASH

00:34.200 --> 00:36.767
FOR MY NEXT SEMESTER,
MS. KREMZER.

00:36.833 --> 00:38.633
COUNT IT--
IT'S ALL THERE.

00:38.700 --> 00:40.167
MM-HMM...

00:40.233 --> 00:43.133
WELL, THERE'S STILL
AN INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED

00:43.200 --> 00:45.500
HAIR-DYEING EXAM COMING UP,
PLATTER.

00:45.567 --> 00:46.800
YOU'VE GOT
TO PASS THAT

00:46.867 --> 00:49.033
TO EVEN QUALIFY
FOR THE FINAL SEMESTER.

00:49.100 --> 00:51.933
I WON'T LET YOU DOWN,
MS. KREMZER.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.233
YEAH, SURE.

00:54.300 --> 00:57.767
LOOK, IT'S LUANNE.

00:57.833 --> 01:00.533
IT SURE HAS BEEN A HARD YEAR
FOR YOU, LUANNE,

01:00.600 --> 01:04.300
WITH YOUR BOYFRIEND BLOWING UP
AND LOSING ALL YOUR HAIR

01:04.367 --> 01:06.367
AND BEING ON
ACADEMIC PROBATION

01:06.433 --> 01:08.633
BUT YOU KNOW,
IF YOU PASS THIS LAST EXAM

01:08.700 --> 01:10.400
IT'LL TURN EVERYTHING AROUND.

01:11.567 --> 01:15.500
( cackling )

01:15.567 --> 01:17.500
SAD.

01:17.567 --> 01:19.433
VERY SAD.

01:19.500 --> 01:20.700
WHAT IS KAHN THINKING?

01:20.767 --> 01:22.333
HE BOUGHT THE
BEST TRAMPOLINE

01:22.400 --> 01:23.533
OF BUCKLEY'S ESTATE

01:23.600 --> 01:25.100
AND HE'S LETTING
IT GO TO POT.

01:25.167 --> 01:27.200
MAYBE WE OUGHT
TO TALK TO KAHN.

01:27.267 --> 01:29.167
THIS IS A FIX-IT
OPPORTUNITY

01:29.233 --> 01:31.333
THAT ONLY HAPPENS
IN THE MOVIES.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.567
HEY, I KNOW WHAT
WE COULD DO.

01:33.633 --> 01:36.067
BILL, REMEMBER WHEN WE
GOT YOU TO BRUSH YOUR TEETH

01:36.067 --> 01:37.500
BY SAYING YOU DIDN'T KNOW HOW?

01:37.567 --> 01:38.900
YEAH...

01:38.967 --> 01:40.500
REVERSE PSYCHOLOGY.

01:40.567 --> 01:42.067
THAT'LL NEVER WORK.

01:42.133 --> 01:43.233
YES, IT WILL.

01:43.300 --> 01:44.233
GOTCHA!

01:44.300 --> 01:46.067
( chuckling )

01:48.300 --> 01:52.067
( sobbing: )
I JUST TOOK A TEST LAST SEMESTER

01:52.067 --> 01:54.400
AND NOW I'VE GOT ANOTHER TEST.

01:54.467 --> 01:56.067
IT'S NOT FAIR.

01:56.067 --> 01:59.533
HOW OFTEN IN REAL LIFE
ARE YOU TESTED?

01:59.600 --> 02:00.700
( sobbing )

02:00.767 --> 02:02.900
UH, YEAH--
OKAY, THEN.

02:02.967 --> 02:06.700
THE GIRLS AT BEAUTY ACADEMY
ARE SO MEAN!

02:06.767 --> 02:10.967
( sobbing )

02:12.467 --> 02:14.100
THEY ARE MEAN.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.700
YOU MADE YOUR
POINT, BILL.

02:16.767 --> 02:18.733
WELL, IF YOU GUYS ARE HERE

02:18.800 --> 02:21.500
WHO'S GUARDING TRASH CANS
IN ALLEY?

02:21.567 --> 02:22.933
( laughing )

02:23.067 --> 02:25.400
SAY, KAHN,
WE WERE JUST THINKING...

02:25.467 --> 02:27.133
WE DON'T WANT
TO FIX YOUR
TRAMPOLINE.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.133
I DO.

02:28.200 --> 02:29.133
BILL!
WHAT?

02:29.200 --> 02:30.133
DALE.
GAH!

02:30.200 --> 02:31.367
OH...!

02:31.433 --> 02:32.967
NOW I GET IT.

02:33.067 --> 02:35.400
YOU REDNECKS WANT
TO FIX MY TRAMPOLINE

02:35.467 --> 02:37.733
BUT WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

02:37.800 --> 02:38.933
WELL, UH...

02:39.067 --> 02:40.500
YOU MOW MY LAWN FOR TWO MONTHS.

02:40.567 --> 02:42.067
ALL RIGHT.

02:42.133 --> 02:44.067
( laughing )

02:45.967 --> 02:49.267
( all laughing )

02:49.333 --> 02:51.967
PLAYED HIM LIKE
A DAMN FIDDLE.

02:54.633 --> 02:57.133
EXCELLENT, SHARONA.

02:57.200 --> 02:58.600
IF I DIDN'T KNOW

02:58.667 --> 03:01.133
THAT TAIL WAS ATTACHED
TO A HORSE'S REAR END

03:01.200 --> 03:02.667
I'D SWEAR IT WAS CHER'S.

03:02.733 --> 03:04.100
THANK YOU, MISS KREMZER.

03:04.167 --> 03:05.667
OH, VERY GOOD.

03:05.733 --> 03:08.133
EXCELLENT HIGHLIGHTS.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.133
LUANNE PLATTER.

03:10.200 --> 03:13.933
IT'S NOT FAIR--
MY CUSTOMER KEPT SWATTING FLIES.

03:16.533 --> 03:18.533
STEP AWAY FROM THE HORSE.

03:22.933 --> 03:25.533
HM, CHER'S HAIR IS FAKE ANYHOW.

03:25.600 --> 03:29.333
I AM TOO GOING TO PASS
THAT TEST.

03:29.400 --> 03:34.067
WHIP OUT THOSE PLANS.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO,
LET'S GO.

03:35.400 --> 03:36.833
I'VE TAKEN
THE LIBERTY

03:36.900 --> 03:38.833
OF DRAWING UP
SOME SCHEMATICS.

03:38.900 --> 03:40.767
NOW, HERE'S THE TRAMPOLINE
THAT IS

03:40.833 --> 03:44.333
AND HERE IS THE TRAMPOLINE
THAT COULD BE.

03:44.400 --> 03:46.167
( all whoahing )

03:46.233 --> 03:47.233
UH-OH.

03:47.300 --> 03:48.233
I'M ON IT.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.067
HEY, LUANNE, UH...

03:50.100 --> 03:51.500
YOU LOOK
PRETTY TODAY.

03:51.567 --> 03:52.500
RIGHT GUYS?

03:52.567 --> 03:55.067
( all agreeing )

03:55.067 --> 03:57.167
( sighing )

03:57.233 --> 03:59.500
BUCKLEY.

03:59.567 --> 04:01.600
THIS WAS BUCKLEY'S TRAMPOLINE.

04:01.667 --> 04:04.933
IT WAS HIS FAVORITE ONE.

04:05.067 --> 04:08.600
HE NAMED IT NUMBER ONE.

04:08.667 --> 04:11.433
( sobbing )

04:11.500 --> 04:12.433
( sighing )

04:12.500 --> 04:13.967
ALL RIGHT,
WHERE WERE WE?

04:14.067 --> 04:16.933
( indistinct gabbing )

04:18.800 --> 04:21.433
Dale:
WELL, SOME PEOPLE SAY
IT'S TOO BAD BUCKLEY'S DEAD

04:21.500 --> 04:24.533
BUT I SAY THIS TRAMPOLINE
SURE IS GOING TO BE BEAUTIFUL.

04:24.600 --> 04:25.533
Hank:
YEP. GOOD NIGHT.

04:25.600 --> 04:26.600
Dale:
NIGHT, HANK.

04:26.667 --> 04:27.600
Bill:
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

04:27.667 --> 04:28.767
Boomhauer:
GOOD NIGHT, MAN.

04:28.833 --> 04:29.767
Dale:
BILL.

04:29.833 --> 04:31.600
( sighing )

04:47.700 --> 04:49.733
WHO ARE YOU?

04:49.800 --> 04:52.067
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

04:52.133 --> 04:53.633
WELL, WHAT?

04:53.700 --> 04:55.400
CHICKEN-BUTT.

04:55.467 --> 04:57.067
BUCKLEY!

04:57.133 --> 04:59.133
HEY.

05:00.400 --> 05:01.800
PSYCHE.

05:01.867 --> 05:03.567
( chuckling )

05:05.067 --> 05:08.333
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOU BEING DEAD?

05:12.433 --> 05:15.533
ARE YOU AN ANGEL?

05:19.233 --> 05:21.467
DON'T WEAR IT OUT.

05:21.533 --> 05:23.067
( both chuckling )

05:36.167 --> 05:38.833
YOU ARE AN ANGEL.

05:40.367 --> 05:45.067
UNLESS YOU'RE JUST
A HALLUCINOGEN OF MY MIND.

05:45.067 --> 05:47.067
IF YOU'RE REALLY
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL

05:47.067 --> 05:48.467
THEN TELL ME SOMETHING

05:48.533 --> 05:50.600
ONLY THE REAL BUCKLEY
WOULD KNOW.

05:50.667 --> 05:52.700
UH, YOU HAVE
A BIRTHMARK
ON YOUR BUTT

05:52.767 --> 05:54.167
THE SHAPE OF
A HONDA KEY.

05:54.233 --> 05:57.433
YOU ARE A REAL ANGEL.

RADIANT THIS MORNING.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.433
YOU'RE NOT PREGNANT,
ARE YOU?

07:10.500 --> 07:11.433
MM, DISREGARD.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.733
ALL RIGHT.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.900
SAUSAGE.

07:13.967 --> 07:16.600
ALL RIGHT, SAUSAGE.

07:16.667 --> 07:18.767
I HAVE AN
ANNOUNCEMENT
TO MAKE.

07:18.833 --> 07:22.933
LAST NIGHT, I HAD
A RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE.

07:23.067 --> 07:23.967
IX-NAY, IX-NAY.

07:24.067 --> 07:25.800
OBBY-BAY TOO-YAY OUNG-YAY.

07:25.867 --> 07:29.233
LAST NIGHT,
I WAS VISITED BY AN ANGEL--

07:29.300 --> 07:30.967
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

07:31.067 --> 07:32.233
COOL.

07:32.300 --> 07:33.633
MM-HMM, HE WAS ON
THE TRAMPOLINE

07:33.700 --> 07:35.633
AND HE SAID TO TELL Y'ALL "HEY."

07:35.700 --> 07:38.567
I THINK SOMEONE'S
BEEN STUDYING A LITTLE TOO HARD

07:38.633 --> 07:40.233
FOR HER BEAUTY SCHOOL TEST.

07:40.300 --> 07:42.100
PROBABLY SHARONA JOHNSON.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.967
SHE'S ALWAYS STUDYING--
IT'S NOT FAIR.

07:45.067 --> 07:49.233
ANYWAYS, BUCKLEY'S ANGEL AND ME
JUMPED SOME AND THEN, UM...

07:49.300 --> 07:50.733
MOSTLY WE JUST JUMPED

07:50.800 --> 07:53.767
BUT I FEEL BETTER
JUST KNOWING HE'S OKAY.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.700
( chuckling: )
AN ANGEL.

07:59.767 --> 08:01.067
ALL RIGHT.

08:01.100 --> 08:03.900
SHE HAS GIVEN ME
THE HEEBIEST OF JEEBIES.

08:03.967 --> 08:05.233
THE ANGEL PART, SURE

08:05.300 --> 08:07.300
BUT THE WHOLE
NOT CRYING THING?

08:07.367 --> 08:08.300
I LIKE THAT.

08:08.367 --> 08:09.633
I LIKE THAT A LOT.

08:09.700 --> 08:11.367
I TOLD HER USE
PROPER VENTILATION

08:11.433 --> 08:12.867
AROUND THOSE
HAIR CHEMICALS.

08:12.933 --> 08:15.167
SHE'S PROBABLY
JUST STRESSED OUT, PEGGY,

08:15.233 --> 08:16.467
BUT IF THIS HELPS HER

08:16.533 --> 08:18.367
LET HER THINK
WHATEVER SHE WANTS.

08:18.433 --> 08:19.900
SHE SEES BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

08:19.967 --> 08:22.467
NOLAN RYAN SAW HIS ARM
AS A ROCKET LAUNCHER

08:22.533 --> 08:24.900
AND THE CATCHER'S MITT
AS SADDAM HUSSEIN.

08:24.967 --> 08:27.067
DON'T MESS WITH A GOOD THING,
PEGGY.

08:27.100 --> 08:28.067
JUST BE COOL.

08:28.100 --> 08:29.367
I'M COOL.

08:30.967 --> 08:32.866
( knocking )

08:32.933 --> 08:37.299
SO, LUANNE, UH...
THIS ANGEL CERTAINLY SEEMS
TO HAVE MADE YOU HAPPY.

08:37.366 --> 08:38.633
OH, YES.

08:38.700 --> 08:40.967
I THINK THAT IT'S A SIGN
THAT GOD IS...

08:41.067 --> 08:42.799
SURE, SURE, RIGHT-- GOD.

08:42.866 --> 08:45.967
I'LL BET GOD SENT YOU
THIS GUARDIAN ANGEL.

08:46.067 --> 08:48.833
THIS STAND-ON-YOUR-OWN-TWO-FEET
ANGEL.

08:48.900 --> 08:50.767
AND IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
FROM NOW ON

08:50.833 --> 08:52.467
YOU DON'T HAVE TO CRY

08:52.533 --> 08:55.200
BECAUSE BUCKLEY'S ANGEL
WILL HELP YOU THROUGH YOUR TESTS

08:55.267 --> 08:58.167
OR MAYBE FIND AN APARTMENT
OR WHATEVER.

08:58.233 --> 08:59.633
OOH.

08:59.700 --> 09:02.067
MY GUARDIAN ANGEL.

09:02.133 --> 09:03.267
YEP...

09:03.333 --> 09:04.967
FIND AN APARTMENT.

09:08.067 --> 09:09.567
RED ALERT,
RED ALERT.

09:09.633 --> 09:12.900
HEY, BOOMHAUER AND MISTER
DAUTERIVE AND MISTER GRIBBLE.

09:12.967 --> 09:14.700
( chuckling )

09:14.767 --> 09:16.933
WHAT IN THE NAME
OF HELL WAS THAT?

09:17.067 --> 09:19.167
LUANNE CLAIMS SHE
SAW BUCKLEY'S ANGEL

09:19.233 --> 09:20.900
LAST NIGHT ON
THE TRAMPOLINE.

09:20.967 --> 09:23.567
I CONVINCED HER IT WAS
HER GUARDIAN ANGEL

09:23.633 --> 09:25.500
AND NOW SHE'S
ON AN EVEN KEEL.

09:25.567 --> 09:27.733
I SHOULD'VE THOUGHT OF THIS
YEARS AGO.

09:27.800 --> 09:30.833
IT'S LIKE SHE HAS A BOYFRIEND
I NEVER HAVE TO MEET.

09:32.467 --> 09:34.067
AHH...

09:38.367 --> 09:39.900
HEY, LOOK

09:39.967 --> 09:42.567
IT'S LUANNE,
WALKING HER BOOK.

09:42.633 --> 09:44.200
I'M NOT WALKING MY BOOK.

09:44.267 --> 09:46.433
I'M WAITING FOR
MY GUARDIAN ANGEL.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.767
BUCKLEY HAS COME BACK
FROM THE DEAD

09:48.833 --> 09:52.400
TO BOUNCE ON HIS TRAMPOLINE
AND HELP ME WITH MY EXAM.

09:52.467 --> 09:54.567
( all laughing )

09:54.633 --> 09:55.900
DO YOU HEAR YOURSELF?

09:55.967 --> 09:56.933
YOU'RE CRAZY.

09:57.067 --> 09:59.067
I DON'T HAVE TO HEAR MYSELF.

09:59.133 --> 10:01.267
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL HEARS MYSELF.

10:01.333 --> 10:04.600
WELL, YOU ARE GOING
TO FAIL THE HAIR DYE TEST
AND FLUNK OUT OF BEAUTY SCHOOL

10:04.667 --> 10:07.067
AND HAVE TO WORK
AT THE MALL
AT THE PRETZEL PLACE

10:07.133 --> 10:08.733
AND WE'LL ALL BE
FAMOUS HAIRDRESSERS

10:08.800 --> 10:11.067
AND WE'LL ALL BE ON
THE THIRD FLOOR OF THE MALL

10:11.133 --> 10:12.500
WORKING ON THE PEOPLE'S HAIR

10:12.567 --> 10:14.400
WHO EAT PRETZELS
AT THE PRETZEL PLACE.

10:14.467 --> 10:16.100
( all laughing )

10:16.167 --> 10:18.567
WELL, I'LL JUST SPIT
ON YOUR PRETZELS, AND...

10:18.633 --> 10:21.067
NO, THAT'S OKAY.

10:21.133 --> 10:25.567
I FORGIVE YOU BECAUSE
I HAVE A GUARDIAN ANGEL NOW.

10:27.667 --> 10:28.533
EW!

10:28.600 --> 10:30.233
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL,

10:30.300 --> 10:33.600
CAN YOU PLEASE MELT
SHARONA JOHNSON'S FACE?

10:33.667 --> 10:37.367
OH, AND HELP ME PASS MY TEST?

10:37.433 --> 10:40.567
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL?

10:40.633 --> 10:43.233
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.533
OKAY, LET'S GET TO IT.
WHAT'S THIS? A NOTE?

10:50.600 --> 10:53.900
Bill:
OH! TH-THAT'S NOBODY'S.
HANK, GIVE IT BACK.

10:53.967 --> 10:55.300
"DEAR BUCKLEY'S ANGEL,

10:55.367 --> 10:56.600
"BRING ME A WOMAN.

10:56.667 --> 10:57.767
"ANY WOMAN.

10:57.833 --> 11:00.933
LOVE, BILL F.
de la T. DAUTERIVE."

11:01.067 --> 11:02.333
NOW, NOW,
THAT'S BETWEEN ME

11:02.400 --> 11:03.467
AND BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

11:03.533 --> 11:05.367
THERE IS
NO BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

11:05.433 --> 11:07.167
THERE WAS BARELY A BUCKLEY.

11:07.233 --> 11:09.967
THAT GREASEBALL COULDN'T FIND
A HAMMER IN THE MEGA LO MART.

11:10.067 --> 11:11.800
HOW COULD HE POSSIBLY
FIND YOU A WOMAN?

11:11.867 --> 11:14.767
YOU HAVE YOUR GODS,
AND I HAVE MINE.

11:14.833 --> 11:15.933
BILL, SHUT UP.

11:16.067 --> 11:17.667
DALE, LIFT YOUR END.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.233
( screaming )

11:20.300 --> 11:21.900
IT'S A SIGN!

11:21.967 --> 11:23.800
WE'VE BEEN PLAYING GOD
WITH BUCKLEY'S TRAMPOLINE

11:23.867 --> 11:26.367
NOW GOD IS PLAYING GOD WITH US.

11:26.433 --> 11:28.333
AND HE'S A LOT BETTER AT IT.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.100
I REFUSE TO TOUCH
THIS PORTHOLE TO HELL.

11:31.167 --> 11:32.133
( sighs )

11:32.200 --> 11:33.800
LOOK, WE GOT A PROJECT GOING ON

11:33.867 --> 11:36.800
AND BOOMHAUER AND I ARE
THE ONLY SANE ONES AROUND HERE.

11:36.867 --> 11:37.967
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.

11:38.067 --> 11:39.067
YOU KNOW, HAD A NOTHING

11:39.067 --> 11:40.233
BUT TIME A LITTLE OFF, MAN

11:40.300 --> 11:41.767
I BEEN WORKING ON IT
FOR HOURS, MAN

11:41.833 --> 11:43.700
AND BUCKLEY WALK UP
AND JUST TOUCH THE HOOD.

11:43.767 --> 11:44.967
JUST TOUCHES THE HOOD, MAN.

11:45.067 --> 11:46.233
THAT DODGE WAS HEALED, MAN.

11:46.300 --> 11:47.367
"YEA, THOUGH I WALK THROUGH

11:47.433 --> 11:48.900
THE VALLEY OF
THE SHADOW OF DEATH"

11:48.967 --> 11:50.067
MAN, I DON'T TAKE NO...

11:50.067 --> 11:51.700
I AM THIS CLOSE TO FIXING

11:51.767 --> 11:53.233
THE TRAMPOLINE MYSELF.

11:53.300 --> 11:54.600
NO, NO, NO-- DON'T TOUCH IT

11:54.667 --> 11:56.067
OR THE ANGEL WON'T COME BACK

11:56.067 --> 11:57.367
AND I'LL BE ALONE FOREVER.

11:57.433 --> 11:58.467
HOO-WEE.

11:58.533 --> 12:01.067
IT IS A HOT ONE,
TODAY, HUH?

12:01.067 --> 12:02.733
SO... MINH...

12:02.800 --> 12:05.567
HAVE YOU EVER HAD
ANY RELIGIOUS VISIONS?

12:05.633 --> 12:07.533
THIS ABOUT BUCKLEY'S ANGEL,
HUH, PEGGY HILL?

12:07.600 --> 12:08.867
YOU KNOW?

12:08.933 --> 12:10.833
NOT TOO MUCH HAPPEN
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

12:10.900 --> 12:13.367
WHEN SOMEONE COMES BACK
FROM DEAD, IT GETS AROUND.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.067
I MEAN, LUANNE
IS CLEARLY CRAZY.

12:15.100 --> 12:16.767
IF IT WAS A TRUE
RELIGIOUS VISION

12:16.833 --> 12:18.167
WHY WOULD IT
COME TO HER?

12:18.233 --> 12:20.167
I WAS HOME.

12:20.233 --> 12:21.667
UH-HUH.

12:21.733 --> 12:24.067
I MEAN, I HAVE HAD
MY CLOSE CALLS.

12:24.100 --> 12:29.200
ONE TIME, I HEARD A VOICE SAY,
"JESUS IS LOVE"
RIGHT IN MY EAR

12:29.267 --> 12:32.833
BUT THEN, WHEN I TURNED OFF
THE HAIR DRYER
IT WAS SUDDENLY GONE.

12:35.067 --> 12:37.067
Luanne:
AMEN.

12:37.067 --> 12:38.867
AMEN.
AMEN.

12:38.933 --> 12:40.533
Dale:
RUN, HANK!

12:40.600 --> 12:42.367
PORTHOLE TO HELL!

12:42.433 --> 12:43.933
( frustrated sigh )

12:45.267 --> 12:47.100
LUANNE'S GOT
EVERYBODY

12:47.167 --> 12:49.333
GOING ANGEL
CRAZY, PEGGY.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.333
OH, DON'T TELL ME

12:51.400 --> 12:53.867
YOU'RE HEARING "JESUS
IS LOVE" AGAIN.

12:53.933 --> 12:55.767
( gasping ):
JESUS IS LOVE.

12:59.600 --> 13:03.167
SO, STUDYING FOR
YOUR BIG, UH... HAIR TEST?

13:03.233 --> 13:05.367
WELL, I'M WAITING
FOR BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

13:05.433 --> 13:07.433
I THOUGHT WE MIGHT DO
FLASH CARDS.

13:07.500 --> 13:09.267
YEAH. OKAY.

13:09.333 --> 13:12.100
WELL, I'M SURE, WITH HIS HELP,
YOU'LL DO JUST FINE.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.433
YOU'LL PASS THE TEST AND HE'LL
HAVE FINISHED HIS GOOD DEED

13:15.500 --> 13:18.933
AND THERE'LL BE NO NEED FOR HIM
TO COME BACK TO EARTH AGAIN.

13:19.067 --> 13:22.267
AND IF YOU DO SEE
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL AGAIN

13:22.333 --> 13:25.800
IT'LL ACTUALLY BE
AN EVIL ANGEL OF DEATH.

13:25.867 --> 13:27.433
I DIDN'T MAKE UP THE RULES.

13:27.500 --> 13:28.500
IT'S IN THE BIBLE.

13:28.567 --> 13:30.333
GOOD LUCK, NOW.

13:40.200 --> 13:41.133
( sniffling )

13:41.200 --> 13:42.767
WHERE IS HE?

13:42.833 --> 13:44.767
BUCKLEY ALWAYS DID THIS TO ME.

13:44.833 --> 13:47.067
ONE TIME, WE WERE
SUPPOSED TO SEE COLOR ME BADD

13:47.133 --> 13:48.467
AND HE NEVER SHOWED UP.

13:48.533 --> 13:50.767
I WAS LOOKING FORWARD
TO THAT CONCERT ALL WEEK

13:50.833 --> 13:52.067
AND WHEN I TOLD HIM

13:52.100 --> 13:53.567
HE JUST SAID,
"CHICKEN BEAK."

13:53.633 --> 13:56.967
HE BETTER NOT BE GUARDIANING
SOME OTHER GIRL.

13:57.067 --> 14:01.100
MAYBE I SHOULD DROP OUT
OF BEAUTY SCHOOL, AUNT PEGGY.

14:01.167 --> 14:05.800
WHAT?! LUANNE, YOU HAVE WANTED
TO GO TO BEAUTY SCHOOL
SINCE YOU WERE SIX.

14:05.867 --> 14:09.067
YOU HAVE WANTED TO
GRADUATE BEAUTY SCHOOL
SINCE YOU WERE 12.

14:09.067 --> 14:12.567
IF YOU GIVE UP ON SCHOOL,
HONEY, YOU ARE GIVING
UP ON YOUR DREAMS.

14:12.633 --> 14:15.300
"EDUCATION IS THE SLEEPING PILL
THAT MAKES DREAMS HAPPEN."

14:15.367 --> 14:17.300
PEGGY HILL.

14:17.367 --> 14:19.067
BUT SCHOOL IS HARD.

14:19.100 --> 14:22.067
I SHOULD JUST GIVE UP
AND SELL PRETZELS.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.700
UH-UH.

14:23.767 --> 14:25.967
NOW YOU HAVE TO REACH
DEEP INSIDE YOURSELF

14:26.067 --> 14:28.667
AND STOP DEPENDING ON
YOUR UNCLE OR YOUR BOYFRIEND

14:28.733 --> 14:30.133
OR YOUR BOYFRIEND'S ANGEL.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.800
THIS TIME, IT IS ALL UP TO YOU.

14:31.867 --> 14:35.467
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL
HELPS THOSE WHO
HELP THEMSELVES.

14:35.533 --> 14:37.567
I'LL DO IT.

14:37.633 --> 14:39.167
YOU'LL HELP ME, RIGHT?

14:39.233 --> 14:40.633
OF COURSE.

14:40.700 --> 14:42.367
( snoring )

14:43.867 --> 14:45.867
( yawning )

14:45.933 --> 14:48.067
( gasping )

14:50.200 --> 14:53.100
I DON'T WHY YOU DIDN'T
COME, BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

14:53.167 --> 14:54.867
IF THIS IS SOME KIND OF TEST

14:54.933 --> 14:56.900
I'LL HAVE TO TAKE A MAKEUP TEST

14:56.967 --> 15:00.567
BECAUSE I HAVE A MAKEUP AND
A HAIR TEST THIS MORNING.

15:07.767 --> 15:08.867
HEY.
( gasping )

15:08.933 --> 15:10.367
OH, YOU FINALLY
SHOWED UP.

15:10.433 --> 15:12.067
THANK YOU,
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

15:12.100 --> 15:14.067
THANK YOU.

15:14.100 --> 15:16.267
UH-HUH. YOU'RE GOING
TO FAIL THE TEST.

15:16.333 --> 15:18.067
WHAT?!

15:18.100 --> 15:19.733
YEAH, I HAVE A MESSAGE
FROM JESUS.

15:19.800 --> 15:22.067
SOMETHING ABOUT HOW
YOU SUCK AT BEAUTY SCHOOL

15:22.100 --> 15:23.567
EXCEPT WORDED NICER.

15:23.633 --> 15:25.567
UH, HERE... UH...

15:25.633 --> 15:28.067
"LUANNE, YOU REALLY SUCK
AT BEAUTY SCHOOL.

15:28.133 --> 15:29.067
"DROP OUT.

15:29.133 --> 15:30.400
LOVE, JESUS."

15:30.467 --> 15:31.900
HUH. HE UNDERLINED "REALLY."

15:31.967 --> 15:33.233
I GUESS IT WASN'T NICER.

15:33.300 --> 15:35.967
I THOUGHT ANGELS WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE GOOD.

15:36.067 --> 15:38.167
YOU'RE A TERRIBLE ANGEL,
BUCKLEY.

15:38.233 --> 15:39.633
I WISH YOU NEVER DIED.

15:39.700 --> 15:41.233
HEY, JESUS SAID IT, NOT ME.

15:41.300 --> 15:42.900
YOU ARE MEAN.

15:42.967 --> 15:45.400
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU
WERE MY BOYFRIEND.

15:45.467 --> 15:47.900
BUT I HAVE FAITH IN ME

15:47.967 --> 15:50.567
AND I AM NOT GOING
TO BE TRAILER TRASH.

15:50.633 --> 15:53.100
I'M GOING TO GRADUATE
AND I'M GOING TO DO MAKEUPS

15:53.167 --> 15:55.933
AND I'M GOING TO HAVE THE
BIGGEST TRUCK IN HOLLYWOOD!

15:56.067 --> 15:57.867
JESUS SAYS YOU'RE MEANT
FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

15:57.933 --> 15:59.533
HE CAN'T SAY WHAT.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.433
WELL, Y'ALL ARE WRONG.
I'M MEANT FOR BEAUTY SCHOOL.

16:01.500 --> 16:02.433
NUH-UH.
UH-HUH.

16:02.500 --> 16:03.433
NUH-UH.
UH-HUH!

16:03.500 --> 16:05.067
NUH-UH!
YES!

16:05.100 --> 16:06.500
( both screaming )

16:06.567 --> 16:08.433
BAIL!

16:15.767 --> 16:18.067
( horn honks )

16:23.967 --> 16:25.567
OH, MY GOSH.
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

16:25.633 --> 16:26.667
I THINK I'M OKAY.

16:26.733 --> 16:28.567
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT STUDYING

16:28.633 --> 16:30.300
AND... AND I WAS SO TIRED.

16:30.367 --> 16:32.500
AND I WAS DRIVING AND NOW I'M...

16:32.567 --> 16:33.700
DO YOU WANT
TO SIT DOWN?

16:33.767 --> 16:35.100
YES, VERY MUCH.

16:38.167 --> 16:39.100
( gasping )

16:39.167 --> 16:41.067
OH, LOOK-- I LOOK TERRIBLE.

16:41.067 --> 16:42.933
AND I HAVE TO TAKE A TEST.

16:43.067 --> 16:44.133
SO?

16:44.200 --> 16:45.633
LOOKS ARE TEN PERCENT
OF THE GRADE.

16:45.700 --> 16:47.367
LOOKS? WELL,
WHAT CLASS ARE
YOU TAKING?

16:47.433 --> 16:49.433
I BET IT'S
STATISTICS WITH
PROFESSOR RUTLEDGE.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.567
HE'S SUCH A PIG.

16:50.633 --> 16:51.667
NO, IT'S HAIR COLORING

16:51.733 --> 16:53.233
WITH MS. KREM...

16:53.300 --> 16:54.433
WAIT... WAIT... YOU THOUGHT

16:54.500 --> 16:55.800
THAT I WAS IN SCHOOL WITH YOU?

16:55.867 --> 16:58.067
IN COLLEGE?

16:58.067 --> 16:59.600
YEAH, WHY NOT?

16:59.667 --> 17:02.067
YOU SURE
YOU'RE OKAY?

17:02.100 --> 17:04.633
YEAH, 'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TO GO
WATCH SATURDAY NIGHT FEVER

17:04.700 --> 17:06.099
FOR OUR AMERICAN
CULTURES CLASS.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.700
YEAH, I'M OKAY.

17:07.767 --> 17:09.767
WELL, GOOD LUCK
ON YOUR TEST.

17:24.767 --> 17:27.500
HEY, LUANNE,
WHERE'S YOUR GUARDIAN ANGEL?

17:27.567 --> 17:28.767
PARKING THE CAR?

17:28.833 --> 17:30.733
( derisive laughter )

17:32.733 --> 17:34.667
ALL RIGHT, LET'S BEGIN.

17:34.733 --> 17:36.900
GLOVES ON.

17:42.767 --> 17:46.367
( humming )

17:46.933 --> 17:48.400
SO, UH...

17:48.467 --> 17:50.433
ANY ANGEL SIGHTINGS
THIS EVENING?

17:50.500 --> 17:52.167
Dale:
NO, NOT YET.

17:54.267 --> 17:55.567
OOPS.

17:55.633 --> 17:57.400
WELL, NOW, WHAT'S THIS?

17:57.467 --> 17:59.233
HUH. IT'S A LETTER.

17:59.300 --> 18:01.800
"FROM THE DESK OF
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL."

18:01.867 --> 18:03.100
( gasping )

18:03.167 --> 18:05.100
LET'S SEE HERE--

18:05.167 --> 18:07.067
"DEAR BILL, BOOMHAUER
AND DALE...

18:07.100 --> 18:09.700
"I HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO
FIND A WOMAN FOR BILL.

18:09.767 --> 18:11.700
"ANY WOMAN.

18:11.767 --> 18:13.500
"OR A CRANKSHAFT
FROM A 1968 DODGE.

18:14.967 --> 18:18.067
"AND THE PORTHOLE TO HELL
IS ACTUALLY LOCATED

18:18.133 --> 18:20.833
"IN HANK'S GARAGE,
NEAR ALL OF HIS TOOLS

18:20.900 --> 18:23.233
"WHICH SHOULD BE
AVOIDED BY ANYONE

18:23.300 --> 18:25.467
AFRAID OF THE
PORTHOLE TO HELL."

18:25.533 --> 18:26.900
WELL, THAT'S THAT.

18:26.967 --> 18:28.267
GOOD-BYE,
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.167
GOOD-BYE,
BUCKLEY'S ANG...

18:30.233 --> 18:31.267
HOLD THE PHONE.

18:31.333 --> 18:32.933
LET ME SEE
THAT LETTER.

18:33.067 --> 18:34.933
( mumbling )

18:35.067 --> 18:36.267
( gasping )

18:36.333 --> 18:37.933
THAT'S NOT BUCKLEY'S
HANDWRITING.

18:38.067 --> 18:40.067
HANK!

18:41.533 --> 18:44.400
( all mumbling )

18:44.467 --> 18:46.567
B... B... BUT...

18:48.567 --> 18:49.967
GOOD.

18:50.067 --> 18:52.300
NOW, I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A TRAMPOLINE TO FIX.

18:52.367 --> 18:55.167
I GUESS I COULD
PITCH IN A LITTLE BIT.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

19:00.067 --> 19:01.167
( excited giggles )

19:01.233 --> 19:02.367
GUESS WHAT?

19:02.433 --> 19:04.667
YOU ACED THE EXAM.
I KNEW IT.

19:04.733 --> 19:06.200
OH! CONGRATULATIONS, LUANNE.

19:06.267 --> 19:07.900
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:07.967 --> 19:10.067
EVEN BETTER, AUNT PEGGY.

19:10.067 --> 19:14.100
BUCKLEY'S ANGEL CAME BACK
AND THEN I ALMOST HIT
A WIENER WAGON

19:14.167 --> 19:16.200
BUT FIRST, BUCKLEY SAID
JESUS SAID

19:16.267 --> 19:18.633
I WAS MEANT FOR SOMETHING ELSE
AND I THOUGHT JESUS
MEANT SOMETHING WORSE

19:18.700 --> 19:20.567
AND THEN I REMEMBERED
YOU TELLING ME

19:20.633 --> 19:22.100
NOT TO GIVE UP
ON MY DREAMS.

19:22.167 --> 19:24.567
AND I REALIZED THAT
HE MEANT SOMETHING BETTER.

19:24.633 --> 19:27.500
AND I GOT MY TUITION REFUND
FROM MS. KREMZER

19:27.567 --> 19:30.067
AND ENROLLED AT
ARLEN COMMUNITY COLLEGE

19:30.100 --> 19:31.500
JUST LIKE JESUS SAID.

19:31.567 --> 19:32.900
( giggles and screams )

19:32.967 --> 19:33.900
COLLEGE?

19:33.967 --> 19:35.433
REAL COLLEGE?

19:35.500 --> 19:38.100
OH, LUANNE, YOU ARE DREAMING
WITH THE BIG BOYS NOW.

19:38.167 --> 19:41.167
THIS IS THE HAPPIEST DAY
OF MY LIFE!

19:41.233 --> 19:43.500
( chuckling ):
LUANNE, WELL,
THAT'S GREAT.

19:43.567 --> 19:44.800
I MEAN... WOW.

19:44.867 --> 19:46.533
BUT YOU'LL BE
MOVING INTO A DORM.

19:46.600 --> 19:48.333
ALL OF OUR DREAMS
HAVE COME TRUE.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.500
( chuckling )

19:49.567 --> 19:51.167
UM, WELL, UNCLE HANK,

19:51.233 --> 19:55.300
WITH TUITION AND BOOKS
AND BACK-TO-SCHOOL CLOTHES

19:55.367 --> 19:57.767
I CAN'T AFFORD TO MOVE OUT NOW.

20:01.567 --> 20:03.000
WELL...

20:03.067 --> 20:05.667
I GUESS AS LONG AS
YOU'RE IN SCHOOL

20:05.733 --> 20:07.500
BETTERING YOURSELF
AND WHATNOT...

20:07.567 --> 20:09.800
THANK YOU, UNCLE HANK.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.767
DON'T THANK ME...

20:11.833 --> 20:13.567
HUG YOUR AUNT PEGGY.

20:13.633 --> 20:16.667
I'M GOING TO START OUT
AS A LIBERAL ARTIST.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.167
IT'S REALLY
THE SAME AS...
HUH.

20:20.233 --> 20:22.767
I DIDN'T KNOW THERE
WAS A WIENER WAGON
STOPPING IN ARLEN.

20:22.833 --> 20:24.767
OBVIOUSLY NOT...

20:24.833 --> 20:27.233
OR YOU WOULD HAVE
TAKEN ME.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.000
HEY.

20:37.067 --> 20:38.100

BACK TO SAY

20:41.567 --> 20:43.367
I'M SORRY I BAILED
OUT OF THE CAR.

20:43.433 --> 20:45.767
I KNEW YOU WEREN'T
REALLY A JERK.

20:45.833 --> 20:46.967
YEAH.

20:47.033 --> 20:49.100
WELL, UH... I GOT TO GO.

20:49.167 --> 20:50.700
JESUS IS HAVING A PARTY TONIGHT.

20:50.767 --> 20:52.167
IT'S GONNA ROCK.

20:52.233 --> 20:55.200
THERE'LL PROBABLY BE
A LOT OF PEOPLE THERE

20:55.267 --> 20:56.967
BUT IF YOU SEE JESUS...

20:57.033 --> 21:00.067
TELL HIM I SAID THANKS.

21:00.100 --> 21:01.600
GOOD-BYE, BUCKLEY.

21:01.667 --> 21:03.600
BEFORE I GO... UM...

21:03.667 --> 21:06.067
COULD I HAVE
ONE LAST KISS?

21:06.133 --> 21:07.733
MM-HMM.

21:07.800 --> 21:08.900
( gasping )

21:08.967 --> 21:10.567
NO...

21:10.633 --> 21:11.933
THAT PART'S OVER.

21:12.067 --> 21:12.967
