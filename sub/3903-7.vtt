00:22.105 --> 00:24.106
Something in particular?

00:24.206 --> 00:26.305
-Funeral.
-I'm sorry.

00:26.406 --> 00:27.806
No, funeral, you know?

00:27.906 --> 00:30.007
No, I mean, I'm sorry for your loss.

00:30.107 --> 00:31.507
Yeah.

00:33.808 --> 00:35.508
That's a popular one.

00:38.609 --> 00:42.210
-Who was it that passed, a relation?
-No, we worked together.

00:42.309 --> 00:47.210
-I see. A professional relationship.
-Yeah, professional.

00:47.410 --> 00:52.111
I mean, we wasn't all that tight,
but he was still my nigger.

00:53.511 --> 00:56.212
I think I'm on it. Follow me.

01:03.914 --> 01:06.214
Hell, yeah, this what I'm talking about.

01:06.315 --> 01:08.614
That gat and grip thing
over there sells a lot.

01:08.715 --> 01:12.015
We can do that in white,
or red, or pink carnations.

01:12.115 --> 01:15.216
-Pink?
-Your boy was too fierce for the pink?

01:15.316 --> 01:17.116
No, he wasn't all that.

01:17.217 --> 01:20.717
But when you stand with a nigger,
you stand with him to the end...

01:20.818 --> 01:22.817
otherwise you ain't nothing yourself.

01:22.917 --> 01:25.318
True that. How did your boy fall?

01:27.318 --> 01:28.619
Hung himself.

01:30.719 --> 01:33.020
Over at The Cut, strung himself up.

01:33.120 --> 01:35.820
Judge ran wild on his ass, gave him 20.

01:36.721 --> 01:40.021
I guess he couldn't handle
all those years, you know?

01:40.122 --> 01:43.122
It's a weak-ass nigger
when you think about it.

01:43.222 --> 01:47.222
But it ain't no reason to drag
his name down no further, you know?

01:51.424 --> 01:55.024
I'll tell you what.
Let me get something in strong colors.

01:55.124 --> 01:58.224
Red, black, whatever.
But make it look like one of the Towers...

01:58.325 --> 02:00.926
down on Franklin Terrace.
You know, the high-rises.

02:01.026 --> 02:04.226
You want the arrangement
to look like a high-rise housing project?

02:04.327 --> 02:05.827
Hell, yeah.

02:06.326 --> 02:09.827
And put the numbers 221
in big-ass numbers on the front.

02:10.026 --> 02:13.228
All right? He used to have that
Fremont Tower for a while.

02:13.328 --> 02:17.129
221, all right.
Anything else you want it to say?

02:18.729 --> 02:19.729
Like what?

02:19.829 --> 02:22.630
"Rest in peace," "In Remembrance,"
something like that?

02:22.730 --> 02:25.830
Something that says
how you feel about the loss.

02:27.931 --> 02:30.932
Look, man, fuck it, all right? Just....

02:35.132 --> 02:38.633
Just make sure the Towers
look like they do, all right?

02:40.233 --> 02:42.234
All right. Thanks.

04:23.955 --> 04:26.755
-You cloned a what?
-A computer.

04:26.855 --> 04:29.956
We can watch how the cargo
comes off the ship in real time...

04:30.056 --> 04:33.157
try to follow the contraband,
see where it leads.

04:33.357 --> 04:37.158
We're running a 25-murder-a-month
MASH Unit here...

04:37.257 --> 04:41.859
and you guys wanna slow things down a bit,
and do a bit of brain surgery.

04:41.959 --> 04:45.559
If Rawls comes walking through here
and sees the two of you hunched over...

04:45.659 --> 04:49.060
playing video games on 14 open murders,
he's gonna blow!

04:49.160 --> 04:51.561
That is exactly why we asked Lt. Daniels...

04:51.661 --> 04:54.261
to set us up at his off-site,
over in the southeast.

04:54.361 --> 04:58.162
They're looking at the dock boys
for other shit, drugs mostly.

04:58.662 --> 05:01.862
-Daniels, who used to be in Narcotics?
-Yeah.

05:03.062 --> 05:07.464
If Daniels has a detail set up already,
maybe he takes the murders, too.

05:07.564 --> 05:11.364
He ain't no fool, Jay.
He's just giving us a room with no view.

05:20.467 --> 05:23.567
That was approval, right?
He gave approval to go ahead with this.

05:23.667 --> 05:25.168
I don't know.

05:27.167 --> 05:28.368
What's next?

05:28.468 --> 05:32.369
Next is for us to get them dock boys
back to thinking that we've gone away.

05:32.469 --> 05:35.970
I mean, we spooked them right good
with that grand jury shit.

05:36.070 --> 05:38.570
If we're gonna set up on them,
they need to think...

05:38.670 --> 05:40.470
we ain't gonna be a problem no more.

05:40.570 --> 05:42.771
How are they gonna think that?

05:44.271 --> 05:46.771
No, see, that ain't the way it works.

05:46.972 --> 05:48.073
It ain't.

05:48.172 --> 05:51.873
'Cause I'm the one out here all day
taking the chance, right?

05:51.973 --> 05:55.674
Police roll up into this bitch,
it ain't gonna be you that catch no charge.

05:55.774 --> 05:58.074
So, least-wise, the thing you need to do...

05:58.174 --> 06:01.475
is lay all that good shit
down on an even split.

06:01.575 --> 06:05.376
Come Friday, me and my niggers
done sold all that shit off...

06:05.676 --> 06:08.777
you come past and get paid.
That's how I'm at with it.

06:08.877 --> 06:10.177
Hey, Frog.

06:12.677 --> 06:13.977
Come here.

06:16.078 --> 06:18.379
No, seriously. Come here.

06:22.379 --> 06:25.379
First of all,
and I don't know how to tell you this...

06:25.479 --> 06:27.580
without hurting you deeply...

06:27.680 --> 06:31.881
first of all, you happen to be white.

06:32.882 --> 06:35.482
I'm talking raised-on-Rapolla-Street white...

06:35.582 --> 06:38.282
where your mama used to drag you down
to St. Casimir's...

06:38.382 --> 06:41.783
just like all the other
little pisspants on the block.

06:42.083 --> 06:44.583
Second, I'm also white.

06:46.084 --> 06:49.185
Not hang-on-the-corner-
don't-give-a-fuck white...

06:49.384 --> 06:52.785
but Locust-Point-l.B.S.-Local-47 white.

06:53.386 --> 06:56.186
I don't work without no fucking contract...

06:56.286 --> 06:59.387
and I don't stand around
listening to horseshit excuses...

06:59.487 --> 07:02.387
Iike my cousin Ziggy, who, by the way...

07:02.487 --> 07:06.889
is still owed money by you
and all your down, street-wise whiggers.

07:08.888 --> 07:12.289
You go in your pocket,
come up with $500 in advance...

07:12.389 --> 07:14.890
and the $210 that you owe to Zig...

07:15.990 --> 07:17.991
you can work my package.

07:18.590 --> 07:23.391
This is the shit you had out here last week.
The dimes that Moochie was slinging?

07:24.992 --> 07:27.893
The shit was good. Moochie sold out quick.

07:30.393 --> 07:31.693
All right.

07:35.994 --> 07:39.595
I'm saying, I'm gonna send
my man around with the dollars.

07:39.695 --> 07:42.395
-Keep it real.
-Whatever.

08:26.204 --> 08:30.206
-Everything to your satisfaction?
-Yeah, you on it.

08:32.206 --> 08:36.006
Prison people taking it that
that boy hung his own self, right?

08:36.207 --> 08:37.407
Seems so.

08:38.707 --> 08:41.008
My cousin always works clean.

08:44.508 --> 08:46.808
None of my business, I know...

08:48.109 --> 08:50.810
but did your man Avon even know about it?

08:56.111 --> 08:58.111
You're on your own here?

08:59.811 --> 09:03.512
You're right. It ain't none of your business.

09:04.912 --> 09:06.713
And if I were you...

09:07.113 --> 09:10.514
I wouldn't want a word of this mess
up in Avon's ear.

09:14.714 --> 09:18.315
Baltimore niggers off the hook. I swear.

09:22.016 --> 09:23.317
All y'all.

09:29.017 --> 09:33.119
You better get up in this before it get cold.
This shit is good.

09:37.519 --> 09:42.120
My man, that bullshit ain't on you.
It ain't, man.

09:42.721 --> 09:46.621
Up in here, D knew he had to stand
on his own. You know this.

09:47.622 --> 09:49.422
Man, fuck him.

09:51.622 --> 09:55.123
He knew when he hung himself
how we was gonna carry it.

09:55.323 --> 10:00.224
He knew when he did that, that we were
gonna be in a moment like this, right now.

10:01.224 --> 10:02.624
He knew that.

10:03.225 --> 10:06.025
That nigger did that shit to hurt me, man.

10:08.826 --> 10:12.526
But, you know, man,
D was just fucking weak.

10:14.026 --> 10:16.728
I tried to crimp him along
since he was a shorty, nigger.

10:16.828 --> 10:18.827
I tried to bring him up, bring him along--

10:18.928 --> 10:22.228
-You were real good to him.
-I was.

10:23.628 --> 10:27.029
Man, it's sad, what happened.
That shit is sad.

10:27.730 --> 10:30.930
But the boy almost
rolled on you that one time.

10:31.031 --> 10:34.531
You know, he get to thinking
he can't do the years in here...

10:34.630 --> 10:37.532
he might've could've rolled again.
Who knows?

10:37.832 --> 10:39.532
I'm just saying...

10:39.932 --> 10:43.233
it might've been for the best, you know?

10:51.234 --> 10:54.435
His name is Head. Dick Head.

10:58.336 --> 11:01.637
Check this out. Put your finger right there.

11:03.636 --> 11:05.337
-Nice.
-Nice, right?

11:06.138 --> 11:08.538
-Fellows.
-We need a bug.

11:08.638 --> 11:10.939
Something that can stand up
to the pressures...

11:11.039 --> 11:13.139
of the modern urban crime environment.

11:13.338 --> 11:14.840
Let me show you.

11:18.740 --> 11:23.341
Okay, fellows, this is the real deal.
Smaller than a 22.

11:23.441 --> 11:26.942
And it's got a clear channel. Sturdy as hell.

11:27.042 --> 11:30.643
You get this bad boy
within 10 feet of any conversation...

11:30.743 --> 11:33.443
it sounds like Chuck Thompson
doing play-by-play.

11:33.543 --> 11:35.544
-How much?
-$1,500.

11:37.044 --> 11:41.945
But seeing as you're sworn officers,
the police discount drops it to $1,250.

11:44.345 --> 11:46.246
-You in?
-Am I in?

11:46.346 --> 11:48.746
The man just said $1,250, Herc.

11:51.147 --> 11:52.847
Can we give it a test run?

11:52.947 --> 11:56.248
A test drive in the modern
urban crime environment?

11:56.847 --> 11:59.849
Yeah, leave me your credit card
and take it for 48 hours.

11:59.948 --> 12:02.449
Change your mind, bring it back.
No problem.

12:02.549 --> 12:05.149
-Let me consult my partner.
-Of course.

12:06.950 --> 12:08.850
You got a credit card?

12:09.151 --> 12:11.851
-Don't you?
-It's maxed to the max, man.

12:12.151 --> 12:14.851
We've been doing
hand-to-hands for a while now...

12:14.951 --> 12:17.653
and we ain't no higher up
on the ladder and on those corners.

12:17.752 --> 12:22.553
We're just gonna use it for a couple days,
get what we need, and bring it back.

12:26.054 --> 12:28.655
I gave your man some room, that's all.

12:30.855 --> 12:32.555
You gave him a home.

12:33.055 --> 12:36.656
Det. Moreland's target
looks to be the same as yours.

12:37.156 --> 12:39.156
-No.
-Yes.

12:39.957 --> 12:42.257
You could take these 14 homicides...

12:42.357 --> 12:46.058
and turn that half-assed detail
you got going into something that matters.

12:46.158 --> 12:49.659
I'll be honest. You solve the murders,
I'll love you for the stats.

12:49.759 --> 12:53.359
And if you don't,
I've made it so the Homicide Unit...

12:54.060 --> 12:57.861
doesn't have to bear the whole brunt
of a lower clearance rate.

12:59.161 --> 13:00.961
It's win-win for me.

13:03.261 --> 13:05.362
-No.
-Come on, Lieutenant.

13:05.462 --> 13:07.962
A good turn here will not be forgotten.

13:08.062 --> 13:12.164
I'm trying to dig myself out of the basement
with something simple and clean here.

13:12.264 --> 13:15.064
Drug arrests,
maybe a prostitution bust if I get lucky...

13:15.164 --> 13:17.664
and I'm out from under with Burrell.

13:20.165 --> 13:21.666
Sorry, Colonel.

13:22.866 --> 13:25.866
You keep the murders,
and my ass stays covered.

13:35.568 --> 13:37.369
Smarter than he looks.

13:54.072 --> 13:56.572
-Where's your friend?
-Who's that?

13:57.273 --> 14:01.373
-The black fellow, the Homicide guy.
-Case is done, for all I know.

14:02.774 --> 14:03.875
Yeah?

14:04.174 --> 14:08.075
You all didn't go for nothing,
and no one on the ship did either.

14:08.575 --> 14:11.075
So, he sent me back
and moved on to new business.

14:11.176 --> 14:15.176
-So you back to the usual then?
-Yeah, the usual.

14:15.876 --> 14:19.277
Except I won't be around Patapsco
or North Point much.

14:19.577 --> 14:22.478
Starting tomorrow,
I'm down at the Fairfield Terminals.

14:22.578 --> 14:23.678
Fairfield?

14:23.778 --> 14:26.879
Yeah, bosses want another car
patrolling the chemical plants.

14:26.979 --> 14:29.179
Because of terrorism, I guess.

14:29.979 --> 14:33.080
You're too pretty
for the Fairfield Piers, darling.

14:33.180 --> 14:35.681
You need to be uptown here with us.

14:50.584 --> 14:52.784
You got stripes in the Southeast...

14:52.884 --> 14:56.285
and can't pull Valchek's spy van
to work his own detail?

14:56.385 --> 14:58.685
Man, I've never seen that thing.

15:00.685 --> 15:02.886
-Snug.
-As a bug.

15:03.586 --> 15:04.987
In a rug.

15:07.287 --> 15:08.487
Let's go.

15:16.989 --> 15:20.790
-This shit is hypnotic.
-Boring, too.

15:22.190 --> 15:23.590
You make a show of it?

15:23.691 --> 15:26.691
Let everyone working see me
in that radio car.

15:29.092 --> 15:30.992
Is that the Valparaiso?

15:31.992 --> 15:35.493
It ain't a Talco Line ship,
doesn't have Horseface working.

15:35.593 --> 15:37.993
Probably wasting half a day
watching it offload.

15:38.093 --> 15:41.694
-Yeah, we should be at the bar by now.
-Nothing's wasted.

15:41.895 --> 15:45.995
I've been getting a feel for this shit.
How it plays and works without the dirt.

15:46.095 --> 15:48.995
-So when they lose a can--
-I see it go.

15:53.696 --> 15:56.197
Gentlemen. Ladies.

15:57.497 --> 15:59.398
The future is now.

16:00.798 --> 16:03.699
To bring goods
to an exploding global economy...

16:03.799 --> 16:06.699
and to deliver those goods faster,
cheaper and safer...

16:06.799 --> 16:11.500
modern robotics do much of the work
in the world's largest seaport, Rotterdam.

16:11.600 --> 16:14.201
Moving cargo is a traditional
strength of the Dutch...

16:14.300 --> 16:18.402
who shuttle more freight in fewer man-hours
than any port in the world.

16:18.502 --> 16:22.003
And now, the Dutch have modeled
the future of cargo management.

16:22.103 --> 16:25.103
Completely containerized cargo
arrives and departs...

16:25.203 --> 16:29.504
on ships a third of a mile long,
24 hours a day, with short turnaround.

16:29.804 --> 16:32.504
Smart card technology
provides greater security...

16:32.604 --> 16:37.205
and improved accountability, with no need
for unreliable human surveillance.

16:37.405 --> 16:40.406
Frog, man, we light five caps is all, man.

16:40.706 --> 16:44.307
I'm saying, you getting all ridiculous
over bits and pieces. You feeling me?

16:44.407 --> 16:46.408
Nigger, it's the principle of the thing.

16:46.607 --> 16:49.008
It's like you in a store working the register...

16:49.208 --> 16:51.309
and at the end of the day,
the shitjust add up.

16:51.408 --> 16:54.510
Mad Dog gonna roll through here tomorrow
with the re-up...

16:54.609 --> 16:57.110
and I want to have the package
right for once.

16:58.610 --> 16:59.910
Hey, Carver.

17:00.010 --> 17:02.411
Isn't technology the fucking bomb?

17:04.310 --> 17:07.112
...and global positioning systems
guide each container...

17:07.212 --> 17:09.512
to its proper spot,
on board or on the docks...

17:09.612 --> 17:12.713
while state-of-the-art-computers
track shipments in every part--

17:12.813 --> 17:15.713
Some of the systems you're seeing
have already been upgraded.

17:15.813 --> 17:20.015
Rotterdam now works
350 million tons of cargo annually...

17:20.115 --> 17:22.915
Ieaving Singapore a distant second.

17:23.015 --> 17:26.016
What kind of man-hours
are the stevedores clocking over there?

17:26.116 --> 17:29.316
I don't have those figures handy. I'm sorry.

17:29.617 --> 17:32.017
But Rotterdam does employ 4,000 people.

17:32.117 --> 17:36.018
4,000 people to move
350 million tons a year?

17:36.118 --> 17:38.418
-That's right.
-That's efficiency, Nat.

17:38.518 --> 17:40.919
By eliminating
some of the more dangerous work...

17:41.019 --> 17:43.419
the Rotterdam technologies have reduced...

17:43.519 --> 17:47.420
employee work-related accidents
and injuries by 60%.

17:47.520 --> 17:50.121
I think we can all be happy
with that, can't we?

17:50.221 --> 17:51.221
Question? Yes?

17:51.421 --> 17:53.321
The GPS readings, are they exact....

17:53.421 --> 17:55.921
You can't get hurt
if you ain't working, right?

17:56.122 --> 17:59.122
No, they work with all kinds of cargo,
in all kinds of weather.

17:59.322 --> 18:00.523
Coming.

18:03.223 --> 18:06.124
-Hey, Jackie.
-String. You, too?

18:06.324 --> 18:08.624
We got enough food
for three weeks right now.

18:08.924 --> 18:11.525
How's Brianna? ls she back there?

18:13.425 --> 18:15.325
What's up, little man?

18:21.827 --> 18:23.527
How you holding up?

18:35.730 --> 18:36.730
Bri.

19:30.642 --> 19:33.842
-Nicky boy, you get days this week?
-No.

19:34.142 --> 19:37.743
Four ships on Thursday.
You could've pulled a day for sure.

19:45.145 --> 19:49.946
That's your half on the last two packages,
plus what Frog owed you on your own shit.

19:51.745 --> 19:53.446
It's all there, cuz.

19:56.846 --> 20:00.047
-What the fuck is wrong with you, smiley?
-Nothing.

20:03.348 --> 20:05.048
What did Frog say?

20:05.248 --> 20:09.049
"Here's a couple of hundred extra,
make the little goof happy"?

20:10.450 --> 20:12.450
The packages were my thing, Nick.

20:12.649 --> 20:15.050
Fuck, if you ain't handle
that business better, too.

20:15.151 --> 20:16.751
Zig, we're making money.

20:27.152 --> 20:28.953
It's your move, Nicky.

20:30.453 --> 20:33.954
Fuck it. I got other issues right now.

20:42.556 --> 20:43.856
Paternity?

20:48.257 --> 20:49.757
Priscilla Katlow.

20:51.758 --> 20:55.859
Jesus, Zig. You knocked up Prissy Katlow?

20:56.459 --> 20:58.359
I only fucked her once.

20:58.760 --> 21:02.060
Christ, everybody down the point
fucked her the once.

21:03.661 --> 21:05.760
How do you know it's yours?

21:07.561 --> 21:09.361
You call this lawyer?

21:10.162 --> 21:12.262
Figured I'd get drunk first.

21:13.862 --> 21:15.562
That's a good plan.

21:39.767 --> 21:43.469
-Russians?
-Lot of girls. Pretty ones.

21:44.869 --> 21:47.769
Most of them had
some kind of accent anyway.

21:48.270 --> 21:51.470
Shardene's friend hooked us up good.
Who's in charge?

21:51.570 --> 21:53.970
You got the club people, I guess.

21:54.070 --> 21:56.772
And there's some woman
I've seen go into the back room.

21:56.872 --> 21:58.372
She looks a little bit older.

21:58.472 --> 22:00.872
I couldn't get close enough
to say much about her.

22:00.972 --> 22:02.773
She looks about 40.

22:06.474 --> 22:08.274
Grab any ass, Prez?

22:14.175 --> 22:17.276
What I'm saying is, I've sorted it out for us.

22:17.376 --> 22:19.476
-I have.
-For us?

22:22.076 --> 22:25.778
When I was in the basement,
it made sense to quit. It did.

22:26.078 --> 22:27.578
But once Burrell reached out--

22:27.678 --> 22:32.479
But Burrell is the one that you crossed.
He's not likely to forget that, is he?

22:32.978 --> 22:36.780
Not to mention what he knows
about you from the bad old days.

22:38.280 --> 22:42.380
Fools half your age
are gonna be Major and Colonel...

22:42.480 --> 22:45.781
and you'll still think that
scratching out a case or two will save you.

22:45.881 --> 22:48.682
It isn't about the casework, I know that.

22:50.083 --> 22:53.283
Just today, Rawls calls me up to CID...

22:53.683 --> 22:57.284
asks me to take his homicides from
the dead girls on that shipping container.

22:57.384 --> 23:00.484
I told him, no shot. That case is a loser.

23:00.784 --> 23:02.585
If I'm looking out for number one...

23:02.685 --> 23:05.185
I'm gonna bring Burrell
exactly what he asked for...

23:05.285 --> 23:08.486
and exactly what he needs
to make Stan Valchek go away.

23:08.586 --> 23:12.687
No more, no less.
I'm playing their game this time.

23:15.988 --> 23:19.488
Look, it's one thing you taking a run
at this dredging thing.

23:19.588 --> 23:22.889
Fucked-up as you are,
we can let that slide for a while...

23:22.989 --> 23:25.090
but now, you're asking too much.

23:25.290 --> 23:26.590
One more year, Nat.

23:26.690 --> 23:29.891
-Not for me, for the fucking union.
-The election's been scheduled.

23:29.991 --> 23:32.391
You knew last year,
when we gave you the votes...

23:32.491 --> 23:35.092
that this time would be Ott's turn.
You knew that.

23:35.192 --> 23:38.192
So Ott runs next time.
He'll take that year and the next.

23:38.292 --> 23:40.093
It's our turn, Frank.

23:40.793 --> 23:43.394
Black, White, what's the difference, Nat?

23:43.493 --> 23:47.094
Until we get that fucking canal dredged,
we're all niggers, pardon my French.

23:47.194 --> 23:49.195
Or Polacks, pardon mine.

23:49.295 --> 23:52.095
You know what I'm saying,
this ain't about Ott.

23:52.195 --> 23:55.796
I just want one more year
to finish what I started here.

23:56.395 --> 24:00.397
Then Ott stays Secretary-Treasurer
for the next two, no problem.

24:01.697 --> 24:03.097
Think about it.

24:17.101 --> 24:18.601
-Hello?
-Brucie, baby.

24:18.701 --> 24:22.401
-Frankie Sobotka, how's it hanging?
-You talk to the presiding officers yet?

24:34.304 --> 24:37.204
Lot of girls. Lot of muscle.

24:41.505 --> 24:43.906
Zig, Jesus, get off me, you jerk.

24:45.906 --> 24:50.307
-When did you get served with these?
-I got them in the mail this morning.

24:50.707 --> 24:53.908
-In the mail?
-Yeah, this morning.

24:57.608 --> 24:59.809
When Pokey Barber got hit with paternity...

24:59.909 --> 25:03.710
a sheriff had to come to his house
and serve him with papers.

25:20.813 --> 25:24.114
Dolores, can I use the bar phone?

25:25.714 --> 25:29.415
-Who are you calling?
-The lawyer on this piece of bullshit.

25:29.715 --> 25:34.116
What? Ain't no fucking law firm open
in the middle of the goddamn night.

25:40.217 --> 25:42.418
Shyster, Shyster and Shyster.

25:59.922 --> 26:02.922
-He got you, Zig.
-Who got me?

26:07.123 --> 26:08.423
Maui?

26:09.423 --> 26:13.324
Love child, never meant to be

26:13.824 --> 26:17.925
Love child, born in poverty

26:18.325 --> 26:22.126
Love child, never meant to be

27:00.534 --> 27:04.435
There's no restroom in the lobby,
and if you're not an approved visitor...

27:04.535 --> 27:07.035
I just don't have the authorization.

27:08.435 --> 27:09.535
Okay.

27:09.936 --> 27:13.737
Tell me something.
When you have to go, where do you go?

27:14.037 --> 27:16.537
Excuse me, sir? Are you a resident?

27:16.637 --> 27:18.838
Sorry. Wrong building.

27:26.439 --> 27:28.440
Sixth floor, all of them.

27:34.941 --> 27:36.542
Thomas "Horseface" Pakusa.

27:36.642 --> 27:39.342
Slated to be the ship-runner
on Talco Line's Esmeralda.

27:39.442 --> 27:42.542
ETA, noon tomorrow,
Berth 6, Patapsco Terminal.

27:42.643 --> 27:45.743
-So we're on.
-We're gonna need help with surveillance.

27:45.843 --> 27:48.944
On the docks especially,
since our faces are known down there.

27:49.344 --> 27:52.745
I can reach out to Greggs and Prez, maybe.
Bring them in on it.

27:52.845 --> 27:55.045
Should we tell the Lieutenant?

27:56.545 --> 27:59.946
Right now, the less he knows
he's involved in the murder investigation...

28:00.146 --> 28:01.947
the happier he'll feel.

28:08.248 --> 28:09.548
New truck?

28:10.449 --> 28:13.449
What the fuck,
we're making money here, right?

28:13.549 --> 28:15.350
-Hell, yeah.
-For real.

28:15.450 --> 28:19.150
This guy's some kind of supplier.
Snap some shots of the truck tags.

28:19.450 --> 28:23.251
-You got more for me?
-I got ifyou got for me, right?

28:23.351 --> 28:27.852
Got to say, your thing is tight.
Best around here in a long while.

28:28.752 --> 28:29.753
Fuck!

28:34.654 --> 28:36.753
I'm with you on this, man....

28:41.354 --> 28:42.854
All right, dawg.

29:01.859 --> 29:04.259
Come on, asshole,
what the fuck's wrong with you?

29:04.459 --> 29:06.260
Keep it fucking moving.

29:06.360 --> 29:07.760
Jesus Christ!

29:15.561 --> 29:16.962
No!

29:32.465 --> 29:32.565
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

29:32.565 --> 29:35.666
I cleared it with KGA,
we'll be working off of Channel 6.

29:35.766 --> 29:39.067
Prez, you got the eyeball
on the outbound truck gate.

29:39.167 --> 29:42.767
Need you to set up so you can move
in either direction on Broening Highway.

29:42.867 --> 29:45.368
Bunk, you set up on Newkirk and Broening.

29:45.468 --> 29:49.568
Me and Russell will be on the computer.
That leaves the terminal itself to Kima.

29:49.669 --> 29:53.370
They might not know my face,
but I sure as shit can't hang down there.

29:53.470 --> 29:56.871
I'm thinking I should borrow
that CG&E truck from Narcotics.

29:56.970 --> 29:59.771
Slap on a hard hat, pick up a clipboard.

29:59.871 --> 30:02.871
What if they're not sneaking anything off
this time? What then?

30:02.972 --> 30:07.873
Tragically, you will have wasted another day
in a life you've already misspent...

30:08.272 --> 30:10.973
in the service of the city of Baltimore.

30:21.475 --> 30:24.776
-Nothing's alive in these, right?
-If they don't go hot to a truck...

30:24.876 --> 30:27.876
you go back in the stacks
and bang on them to make sure.

30:27.976 --> 30:30.277
I trust these Greek fucks with nothing.

30:32.178 --> 30:35.178
-How you hanging?
-Good. I'm good.

30:35.878 --> 30:37.878
You ain't been working much.

30:39.579 --> 30:44.080
Stay close, Nick.
Don't do anything I wouldn't do.

30:50.981 --> 30:53.982
Jesus on the main line

30:54.082 --> 30:56.782
Tell him what you want

30:56.882 --> 31:00.984
Oh, Jesus on the main line

31:01.184 --> 31:04.184
Tell him what you want

31:04.484 --> 31:07.784
Jesus on the main line

31:07.884 --> 31:10.886
Tell him what you want

31:12.585 --> 31:15.986
Call him up and tell him what you want

31:16.086 --> 31:19.287
Ifyou want salvation

31:19.387 --> 31:21.988
Tell him what you want

31:22.088 --> 31:26.088
Oh, ifyou want salvation

31:26.188 --> 31:29.289
Tell him what you want

31:29.389 --> 31:32.690
Ifyou want salvation

31:32.790 --> 31:35.790
Tell him what you want

31:35.890 --> 31:40.491
Call him up and tell him what you want

31:40.791 --> 31:44.792
Oh, call him up, call him up

31:44.992 --> 31:47.393
Tell him what you want

31:47.493 --> 31:51.493
Oh, call him up, call him up

31:51.593 --> 31:54.694
Tell him what you want

31:54.894 --> 31:58.195
Call him up, call him up

31:58.295 --> 32:01.195
Tell him what you want

32:01.496 --> 32:06.397
Jesus on the main line

32:13.398 --> 32:14.999
You did the 221?

32:16.998 --> 32:18.400
Shit look tight.

32:44.305 --> 32:46.004
Sorry for the loss.

32:47.406 --> 32:49.405
You all sent him off right, though.

32:49.505 --> 32:51.906
As good a homecoming as I been to.

32:52.006 --> 32:55.207
-You been to your share, man, I know.
-No doubt.

32:56.807 --> 32:59.407
Of course, this is neither the time
nor the place...

32:59.508 --> 33:02.408
but I thought I might
get at you for a moment.

33:03.309 --> 33:06.909
-Got a proposition here.
-Go ahead to the car, man.

33:11.410 --> 33:14.411
Ain't exactly talking out of turn when I say...

33:14.511 --> 33:17.211
that, uh, Westside dope
been weak for a while now.

33:17.411 --> 33:22.212
Every dope fiend in the city knows that
Avon been putting out piss, calling it shit.

33:22.412 --> 33:26.813
The thing is, y'all sitting on
some of the best real estate in the city.

33:26.913 --> 33:30.514
The Terrace, the low-rises,
the avenue corners.

33:30.614 --> 33:34.115
Respecting the fact that you're known
to have a way with your words...

33:34.214 --> 33:36.915
when are you gonna tell me
something I don't know?

33:38.216 --> 33:41.817
Let me put a point on it.
My shit is right, String.

33:42.416 --> 33:45.917
I got dope coming straight into Baltimore,
and the shit is raw.

33:46.017 --> 33:49.718
85, 90%. And you know it's true.

33:49.818 --> 33:52.919
You got half the Westside coming over
to Fallsway twice a day...

33:53.019 --> 33:56.420
because Eastside dope be kicking the shit
out of Westside dope.

33:56.520 --> 33:59.820
-You connected?
-This shit is straight off the damn boat.

33:59.921 --> 34:03.621
I ain't even going to New York
except for my coke. Ain't no need.

34:03.721 --> 34:08.522
Thing is, y'all got the best territory,
and no kind of product.

34:09.121 --> 34:13.022
I got the best product,
but could stand a little more territory...

34:13.121 --> 34:15.123
so you see where this thing needs to go.

34:15.223 --> 34:18.524
Now you know Avon fought real hard
for them Towers.

34:18.623 --> 34:22.225
We took down the Rayford brothers,
Big Dennis Woodson, I mean--

34:22.324 --> 34:26.525
This shit is just business, String.
Buy for a dollar, sell for two.

34:26.626 --> 34:30.427
That's all it need be. You got the Towers,
I got what goes in them.

34:30.527 --> 34:32.627
Later for all that bullshit.

34:36.027 --> 34:38.527
-I'll talk to Avon.
-You do that.

34:57.332 --> 35:01.332
Come on, I can read a budget summary.
There's nothing in there for dredging.

35:01.432 --> 35:05.234
Shortfall in revenues.
The governor's looking to limit bond issues.

35:05.334 --> 35:08.534
-But the grain pier is still in there.
-And the rest is just talk?

35:08.634 --> 35:11.735
Talk is good, Frank. Talk is a start.

35:11.835 --> 35:14.435
Talk is your fucking job description.

35:14.535 --> 35:16.136
Yak. Yak. Yak. Blah. Blah. Blah.

35:16.436 --> 35:20.836
That's like saying all the checkers do
is punch numbers into a computer.

35:23.937 --> 35:28.439
Your son, the oldest one,
he goes to what school?

35:28.838 --> 35:31.239
-Jason's at Princeton.
-Princeton.

35:32.139 --> 35:34.940
And after he graduates,
he's gonna do what?

35:35.940 --> 35:37.941
-Whatever he wants.
-Right.

35:38.740 --> 35:42.441
You sent him to Princeton
to do whatever the fuck he wants.

35:47.042 --> 35:49.542
You know, back when we were kids...

35:51.043 --> 35:54.743
Danny Hare's father stole
a couple cases of cognac off a ship.

35:54.844 --> 35:58.344
Except when he gets it home,
it ain't cognac, it's Tang.

35:59.845 --> 36:02.246
-Tang?
-Just invented.

36:03.045 --> 36:06.146
TV said it's what the astronauts drank
on their way to the moon.

36:06.346 --> 36:09.547
-You drink it....
-You could be an astronaut, too.

36:10.247 --> 36:13.148
All summer long,
that shit was all the Hare kids drank.

36:13.248 --> 36:15.748
Tang with breakfast, Tang with lunch...

36:15.848 --> 36:19.149
Tang when they woke up scared
in the middle of the night.

36:19.249 --> 36:21.849
What do you think they grew up to be?

36:22.549 --> 36:26.251
Stevedores. What the fuck you think?

36:27.851 --> 36:30.451
Something tells me
Jason DiBiago will grow up...

36:30.551 --> 36:33.351
and squeeze a buck
the way his old man did.

36:33.852 --> 36:35.852
You're out of line, Frank.

36:40.253 --> 36:43.053
My great-grandfather was a knife sharpener.

36:43.854 --> 36:46.654
Pushed a grinding stone up
Preston Street to Alice-Ann...

36:46.754 --> 36:49.355
one leg shorter than the other
from pumping the wheel.

36:49.455 --> 36:52.255
Since he didn't want his sons
to push the goddamn thing...

36:52.355 --> 36:54.856
he made sure my grandfather
finished high school...

36:54.956 --> 36:57.656
and my old man went to any college
that would take him.

36:57.757 --> 36:59.557
You're talking history, right?

37:02.357 --> 37:03.958
I'm talking now.

37:04.558 --> 37:08.159
Down here, it's still: "Who's your old man?"
'til you got kids of your own.

37:08.259 --> 37:10.359
Then it's, "Who's your son?"

37:10.459 --> 37:13.960
But after the horror movie I've seen today....
Robots!

37:15.360 --> 37:17.061
Piers full of robots!

37:17.561 --> 37:20.962
My kid will be lucky if he's
punching numbers five years from now.

37:21.062 --> 37:25.262
While it don't mean shit that I can't take
my steak knives to DiBiago and sons...

37:25.362 --> 37:29.963
it breaks my heart that there's no future
for the Sobotkas on the waterfront.

37:37.065 --> 37:39.765
Here, Brucie. I think they're your size.

37:49.267 --> 37:52.968
I'm operating under the assumption that
because of your relentless diligence...

37:53.068 --> 37:56.668
the funding for the grain pier
is gonna pass the assembly.

38:01.270 --> 38:05.370
But I'm also talking about the canal.
So you're gonna talk about the canal...

38:05.471 --> 38:08.571
the Muldoons who run the old line state
are gonna talk about it...

38:08.671 --> 38:11.572
until some day, some way,
that motherfucker gets dredged...

38:11.672 --> 38:13.873
and we get some ships in here.

38:36.777 --> 38:38.278
Bring it down!

39:07.084 --> 39:10.584
-Got one that disappeared.
-Get the container number?

39:12.185 --> 39:14.685
-1 1-37 to 1 2-14.
-Go ahead, Lester.

39:14.785 --> 39:17.785
-We got one, you prepared to copy?
-Send it.

39:18.686 --> 39:21.086
Zulu, Tango, Golf, Romeo...

39:21.186 --> 39:25.387
9, 7, 3, 2, 6, 5, check digit 9.

39:25.987 --> 39:28.487
Copy that, I've got it in the yard.

39:28.787 --> 39:31.188
-1 1-99.
-11-99.

39:32.088 --> 39:33.989
We got a live one. Be up.

39:34.089 --> 39:36.689
-What am I looking for?
-Stand by on that.

39:36.789 --> 39:40.090
Be advised, I've got a White male,
orange safety vest...

39:40.190 --> 39:41.690
blue overalls.

39:41.790 --> 39:46.291
He's hooking the truck onto the....
What do you call it?

39:47.592 --> 39:49.692
Copy that. What next?

39:49.992 --> 39:53.293
One of two things.
The driver takes it through checkout...

39:53.393 --> 39:56.994
in which case it may be that Horseface
entered the wrong container number...

39:57.094 --> 40:00.794
and they find it there.
Or it goes out to Bobtail Lane.

40:01.795 --> 40:04.495
If it does that, they're doing the dirt.

40:04.995 --> 40:06.996
1 1-37 to 1 2-14.

40:07.095 --> 40:10.396
Kima, keep the eyeball
until it clears the yard.

40:10.496 --> 40:13.697
Advise if it stops at the checkout point,
or goes straight out.

40:13.797 --> 40:14.898
Copy.

40:21.898 --> 40:25.099
1 2-14. He went around the checkout. Copy.

40:26.799 --> 40:30.100
-11-37 to 11-99.
-99.

40:30.200 --> 40:32.101
Target's coming at you, you see it?

40:35.101 --> 40:38.402
I got him on Broening,
heading west towards the city.

40:39.802 --> 40:42.703
Copy, 11-37 to 11-34.

40:42.803 --> 40:46.103
-Target approaching your 20.
-1 1-34, copy that.

40:47.604 --> 40:50.105
I got him going straight on Newkirk.

40:54.405 --> 40:56.806
-He's all yours, Bunk.
-Copy.

41:10.709 --> 41:13.509
-1 1-34, you got the eyeball.
-Copy.

41:39.414 --> 41:41.916
-1 1-34.
-Go ahead, 34.

41:42.415 --> 41:45.916
He went to ground off of Newkirk.
Some kind of warehouse.

41:46.416 --> 41:49.116
Wait one. I'll swing back, get a 20.

41:59.019 --> 42:01.319
Be advised, it is a warehouse.

42:01.419 --> 42:05.220
Pyramid lnc. 5605 Newkirk.

42:07.621 --> 42:08.921
Copy that.

42:15.022 --> 42:18.423
Brianna, man, she putting it on you?

42:23.424 --> 42:25.524
Avon, you knew he was using?

42:27.124 --> 42:29.925
I seen it, but I didn't see it.

42:31.125 --> 42:33.625
I mean, he came up off that shit...

42:33.725 --> 42:37.126
then we did our thing with the guard,
and I thought....

42:43.828 --> 42:45.128
Fuck.

42:46.828 --> 42:51.130
We did our thing with the homegoing, man.
I mean, it came off nice.

42:51.429 --> 42:53.830
-Yeah?
-Yeah, everybody showed.

42:55.630 --> 42:59.431
-How did Brianna do?
-Rough.

43:02.531 --> 43:05.132
Don't nobody want shit like this
to happen, man.

43:05.232 --> 43:08.233
If I'd have known the boy was
gonna be doing shit like that...

43:08.333 --> 43:11.434
-you know what I mean?
-What are the prison people saying?

43:11.534 --> 43:14.034
That he just hung himself like that?

43:15.534 --> 43:19.836
Just tied a rope around a knob,
and sat his ass down.

43:28.637 --> 43:32.438
How the fuck you gonna stop a man
from doing some shit like that?

43:34.038 --> 43:35.438
What are you gonna do?

43:35.538 --> 43:39.039
Stay with him every damn minute,
every day you can?

43:39.139 --> 43:41.840
He gonna find a way if he wants to.

43:43.540 --> 43:45.140
It ain't on you.

43:46.941 --> 43:50.742
It ain't on you. I would tell you if it was.

44:11.546 --> 44:14.046
What's up with that other thing, man?

44:14.146 --> 44:18.147
Still shit, man. Your man in Atlanta
don't know what raw is.

44:19.448 --> 44:22.849
-We gonna discount it.
-Do I look like Kmart to you, man?

44:22.949 --> 44:26.049
-I'm saying, I mean--
-What are you saying? That's ridiculous.

44:26.149 --> 44:28.349
Re-package it and sell it off.

44:28.449 --> 44:31.750
You know, Proposition Joe
came to the funeral.

44:32.150 --> 44:35.651
Pulled me aside. He's got a smoker.
Everybody knows he's got a smoker...

44:35.751 --> 44:39.451
and he wants to share,
if we cut him a slice of the Towers.

44:40.252 --> 44:43.653
-You know, it's a thought--
-It's not even a thought, man. No.

44:43.753 --> 44:47.453
Let me tell you something. We're gonna
get through all this, you hear me?

44:47.553 --> 44:49.754
-I know.
-All of it.

44:58.356 --> 44:59.956
Anything come out?

45:01.156 --> 45:05.257
If there were girls in that can,
they're still inside.

45:12.459 --> 45:15.859
-Your DNRs go where?
-Phones for dockworkers local.

45:15.960 --> 45:19.060
Offices, personal phones
for a couple of union officials.

45:19.160 --> 45:23.861
Look here, 9581737
is listed to Thomas Pakusa.

45:24.160 --> 45:26.862
On February 4th, and March 16th...

45:26.962 --> 45:30.463
our Mr. Pakusa received a call
from Frank Sobotka's cell phone.

45:30.563 --> 45:33.563
And both times, he works
a Talco Line ship the next day.

45:33.663 --> 45:36.263
And both times,
a can goes missing in the computer.

45:36.363 --> 45:38.564
Pretty good argument for a conspiracy case.

45:38.663 --> 45:41.365
-Conspiracy to do what?
-Smuggle shit.

45:42.865 --> 45:44.065
Smuggle what?

45:44.165 --> 45:47.566
For starters, how about bringing girls
here for purposes of prostitution?

45:47.666 --> 45:51.566
-That one we know about.
-You need to do better for a wiretap.

45:55.067 --> 45:59.568
Read your annotated code.
Wiretap Statute, Subsection 10, 406...

45:59.668 --> 46:03.068
designates crimes where telephonic
communication can be intercepted...

46:03.169 --> 46:06.169
in the great state of Maryland. Prostitution?

46:06.870 --> 46:10.170
You mean, you can tap a guy's phone
if he's selling drugs...

46:10.270 --> 46:12.570
but if he's selling women,
he's out of bounds?

46:12.670 --> 46:14.071
That's the law.

46:15.572 --> 46:17.672
Honey, I'm home.

46:25.174 --> 46:27.474
Start looking at the two-bedroom joints.

46:27.574 --> 46:29.975
-We can pay.
-How?

46:30.674 --> 46:33.675
-Got a new job.
-Off the docks?

46:36.476 --> 46:41.377
Three, four days a week.
Warehouse foreman for this Greek guy.

46:41.776 --> 46:45.478
He owns an appliance store
down the avenue in Highland Town.

46:46.477 --> 46:49.279
I can work it around the hours
that I pick up at the docks.

46:49.379 --> 46:50.879
How much, Nick?

46:53.179 --> 46:55.180
Come here.

47:01.381 --> 47:05.282
Like $500 a week. Maybe more.

47:07.282 --> 47:10.582
But steady. You know, we can count on it.

47:11.483 --> 47:13.983
Between what you make
with them scissors and this...

47:14.083 --> 47:17.084
we can pay down the truck
and still have enough left over...

47:17.284 --> 47:20.785
for someplace nice out in the county.

47:30.287 --> 47:31.987
$1,500.

47:33.387 --> 47:35.788
$1,250, with the police discount.

47:36.888 --> 47:40.889
It just couldn't stand up to
the modern urban crime environment.

47:43.189 --> 47:45.490
All right, slow up. This is it.

47:46.090 --> 47:49.891
It's listed to Nicholas Andrew Sobotka,
1485 Reynold Street.

48:00.793 --> 48:04.194
-Sobotka?
-That's what it says here.

48:05.894 --> 48:07.895
That mean anything to you?

48:10.495 --> 48:13.996
Beavis, that's the name of the guy
we're supposed to be working.

48:14.096 --> 48:15.596
Frank Sobotka.

48:17.296 --> 48:18.797
But we got Nicholas.

48:18.897 --> 48:23.197
How many fucking Sobotkas can there be,
even down here in Polack town?

48:25.298 --> 48:27.599
-You know what this means?
-What?

48:28.098 --> 48:31.399
It means old fuzzy Dunlop here
is somewhat worse for wear, I admit...

48:31.499 --> 48:35.000
it's really gonna start paying off
as a confidential informant.

48:35.100 --> 48:38.101
-No fucking way.
-Are you out $1,250?

48:38.701 --> 48:42.002
Because linking a street-level drug connect
to our main target...

48:42.102 --> 48:44.402
has to be worth $200 for starters.

48:45.502 --> 48:50.004
Listen, if I try to register him,
Daniels will smell a rat.

48:50.903 --> 48:54.304
He trusts you, Carv.
You got that trustworthy look.

48:55.704 --> 48:58.304
It's you, Lester. Got to be you.

48:59.806 --> 49:02.406
-Me?
-We need to bring in the Lieutenant...

49:02.506 --> 49:05.807
his detail and all the manpower
and toys that go with it.

49:05.907 --> 49:08.507
And Daniels listens when you talk.

49:08.607 --> 49:11.507
You got the smell of wisdom
on you, brother.

49:15.308 --> 49:18.909
-We all got roles to play.
-What's your role?

49:20.710 --> 49:24.010
I'm just a humble motherfucker
with a big-ass dick.

49:24.910 --> 49:27.310
You give yourself too much credit.

49:27.410 --> 49:30.212
Okay, then. I ain't all that humble.

49:51.615 --> 49:53.616
I'll be goddamned.

50:13.821 --> 50:16.821
I swear to God, if he plays
that goddamn song one more time...

50:16.921 --> 50:18.821
I'm gonna clock his ass good.

50:18.921 --> 50:21.522
You can take him, Zig. He just looks big.

50:21.622 --> 50:24.222
Who the fuck is he? All pussy.

50:24.323 --> 50:28.124
You're a legend of the docks, Zig.
A fucking legend.

50:29.324 --> 50:31.324
You think I can take him?

50:32.224 --> 50:33.724
You can take him.

50:39.226 --> 50:41.726
-Man down, berth five.
-Who?

50:41.826 --> 50:43.226
New Charles.

50:51.228 --> 50:53.929
-Ambo's on the way.
-Jesus Christ.

50:54.029 --> 50:56.429
Night work with break-bulk. I hate this shit.

50:56.529 --> 50:59.329
-You guys gonna move this thing or what?
-Jesus. Fuck.

50:59.430 --> 51:01.330
Ain't supposed to move a guy
when he's hurt.

51:01.430 --> 51:03.631
We'll remember that
when you hit the number.

51:03.731 --> 51:05.931
Quit pulling your dicks
and get this thing off of me.

51:06.031 --> 51:07.631
One, two, three.

51:11.132 --> 51:13.233
Charlie, here. Take a drag.

51:19.534 --> 51:21.934
That's the ambo you're hearing, Charlie.

51:22.935 --> 51:24.235
Right over there.

51:25.635 --> 51:28.536
Don't worry, kid, you're still on the clock.

51:32.237 --> 51:34.537
Frank, how does the leg look?

51:40.938 --> 51:44.639
-Which leg is that now?
-Sir, can you hear my voice?

51:46.239 --> 51:47.739
Squeeze my hand.

51:49.640 --> 51:52.041
Let's get him into the ambulance.

51:52.340 --> 51:54.641
You need to clear the way for us, guys.

51:55.541 --> 51:58.442
-And you followed the can?
-Right to the warehouse.

51:58.541 --> 52:01.643
-Surveillance set up?
-Kima is on it tonight.

52:02.443 --> 52:05.243
This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.

52:05.343 --> 52:07.744
I know it began for you as a bullshit detail...

52:07.844 --> 52:12.245
but this Sobotka's into some shit
that needs to be worked by good police.

52:12.545 --> 52:17.146
The DNRs, the cloned computer.
We've got the pattern.

52:19.946 --> 52:21.747
Rawls came to me.

52:22.447 --> 52:25.648
-Asked if I would take the homicides.
-You should.

52:25.947 --> 52:30.649
Those girls in the can really suffocated.
They really died in that fucking box.

52:33.850 --> 52:37.150
You pick this case up,
you might eat those open murders.

52:37.249 --> 52:39.150
But you let it pass...

52:39.250 --> 52:42.251
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

52:42.251 --> 52:42.951
you got to ask yourself
how you want to live your day-to-day.

53:09.357 --> 53:11.257
From the guys in 15-14.

53:27.160 --> 53:29.060
He should be all right.

53:32.161 --> 53:34.962
You know how he got the name
New Charles?

53:36.663 --> 53:38.562
First day of work was the same day...

53:38.662 --> 53:41.963
the Paceco dropped a hatch cover
on Charlie Bannion.

53:42.063 --> 53:44.963
Had to clean up old Charlie with a shovel.

53:45.464 --> 53:48.564
Ever since then, New Charles.

53:51.065 --> 53:52.965
He's gonna lose the leg.

54:05.068 --> 54:06.969
Where's the money from?

54:20.871 --> 54:25.072
I got your murders.
But what I need from you, I get.

54:26.373 --> 54:28.773
No bullshit, no arguments.

54:30.373 --> 54:31.773
No arguments.

54:44.176 --> 54:46.777
-You're wasting all the batteries.
-So?

54:46.877 --> 54:49.377
Mom, he's wasting all the batteries.

54:49.477 --> 54:53.178
You two get along
or I'm gonna take that tent down right now.

54:53.278 --> 54:54.778
-Snitch.
-Punk.

54:55.178 --> 54:56.779
-Squirrel.
-Mope.

54:57.278 --> 55:00.380
-Shut up.
-Who teaches them this stuff?

55:00.679 --> 55:03.580
It's my turn, you just had it.

55:06.080 --> 55:07.280
Elena.

55:09.081 --> 55:10.281
No.

55:17.383 --> 55:18.983
I don't trust you.

55:22.384 --> 55:24.285
I can care about you...

55:25.184 --> 55:27.685
and I can want us to be friends...

55:28.085 --> 55:30.786
and if you give me enough time, Jimmy...

55:30.886 --> 55:33.886
maybe I will actually want you to be happy.

55:37.587 --> 55:40.488
But how the hell
am I supposed to trust you?

55:40.787 --> 55:42.888
Mom, quick, it's a spider.

55:44.288 --> 55:46.089
It's a big, hairy one.

55:46.389 --> 55:48.389
-Oh, my gosh.
-Come on, Mom.

56:08.093 --> 56:12.594
But if the case does come together,
I would at least have Rawls as a rabbi.

56:12.894 --> 56:14.994
It could still work for me.

56:15.495 --> 56:17.295
Listen to yourself.

56:19.096 --> 56:20.995
I love the job, Marla.

56:21.896 --> 56:24.797
-I can't help it.
-The job doesn't love you.

56:27.298 --> 56:29.097
You know what I love?

56:31.598 --> 56:34.499
The mind that's always a step ahead of me...

56:35.199 --> 56:38.200
the person who never stops
thinking it through.

56:38.300 --> 56:40.900
That's what I fell in love with first.

56:41.701 --> 56:45.200
Do you know what I fell in love with first?
Do you?

56:46.901 --> 56:48.501
Your ambition.

56:50.702 --> 56:52.603
Where did that man go?

56:53.305 --> 56:59.373
